Hi
 everybody,
 I'm
 Steve
 Pacin
 and
 we
 are


here
 in
 New
 Market,
 Ontario
 at
 the
 Upper


Canada
 Mall
 to
 kick
 off
 season
 3
 of
 the


program
 we
 call
 TVO
 Today
 Live.
 Our


subject
 this
 time,
 should
 snowbirds
 skip


going
 to
 the
 warmer
 United
 States
 this


winter?
 A
 year
 ago,
 nobody
 would
 have


considered
 such
 a
 question.
 But
 today,


of
 course,
 lots
 of
 people
 are.
 We
 are


really
 grateful
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 this


series
 on
 TVO,
 and
 we
 have
 to
 thank
 the


generous
 support
 of
 the
 Wilson


Foundation
 for
 doing
 so.
 Red
 Wilson,
 I


know
 you're
 watching,
 and
 I
 want
 to


thank
 you
 for
 the
 way
 that
 you
 have


really
 wonderfully
 helped
 supported
 the


work
 that
 we
 do
 here
 in
 the
 interests
 of


discussing
 democratic
 and
 civic


engagement.
 So,
 thanks
 so
 much,
 Red


Wilson.
 And
 we
 are
 delighted
 to
 welcome


two
 hearty
 souls
 who
 are
 going
 to
 engage


on
 the
 issue
 of
 the
 day.
 And
 here
 they


are.
 Laura
 Babcock
 is
 a
 former
 Chamber


of
 Commerce
 executive
 director,
 now
 a


current
 affairs
 commentator
 and
 host
 of


the
 O
 show.
 And
 Peter
 Sherman
 is
 here.


He's
 a
 former
 progressive
 conservative


member
 of
 the
 Ontario
 legislature
 and
 a


broadcaster
 whose
 nickname
 was
 and
 is


and
 ever
 shall
 be
 the
 Shermanator.


That's
 him.
 Can
 I
 have
 a
 hand
 for
 these


two,
 please?
 for
 coming
 up
 to
 be
 with
 us


[applause]
 here
 today
 at
 the
 ball.


I
 do
 want
 to
 say
 we
 are
 very
 anxious
 to


hear
 from
 this
 audience
 as
 well
 because


you
 are
 not
 just
 here
 to
 be
 potted


plants.
 You
 are
 going
 to
 participate
 as


best
 you
 can
 in
 the
 discussion
 that
 we


are
 about
 to
 have.
 So
 start
 thinking
 now


about
 questions
 andor
 comments
 that
 you


would
 like
 to
 contribute
 to
 our


conversation
 today.
 And
 we're
 going
 to


put
 you
 to
 work
 right
 away
 here.
 I'm


going
 to
 do
 just
 a
 few
 questions
 off
 the


top
 to
 get
 a
 sense
 of
 the
 room
 and
 then


I'm
 going
 to
 describe
 because
 some


people
 are
 listening
 to
 this
 on
 podcast


and
 they
 won't
 see
 it.
 So
 I'm
 going
 to


describe
 sort
 of
 how
 many
 hands
 are


going
 up
 here.
 Question
 one,


we
 are
 mad
 at
 Donald
 Trump.
 And
 a
 good


way
 to
 show
 our
 unhappiness
 with
 his


awful
 behavior
 is
 for
 Canadian
 snowbirds


not
 to
 go
 to
 the
 US
 this
 winter.
 Who


agrees
 with
 that
 sentiment?
 Hands
 up.


>> Okay.
 I
 am
 looking
 at
 most
 of
 the
 hands


up
 in
 the
 room,
 I
 think.
 Okay,
 let's
 try


this
 again.
 Another
 show
 of
 hands.


Canada
 is
 a
 cold
 country.
 Trump
 isn't


going
 to
 care
 one
 way
 or
 another
 whether


we
 go.
 We're
 only
 inconveniencing


ourselves
 if
 we
 don't
 go.
 So,
 it's
 okay


to
 go.
 Hands
 up
 on
 that
 one,
 please.


Wow.
 Very,
 very
 few.
 This
 is
 a
 home
 game


for
 you,
 Laura.
 Okay.
 Um,
 is
 there


anybody
 in
 the
 room
 who
 is
 genuinely


undecided
 on
 this
 issue?
 Can
 I
 see
 some


hands
 on
 that?


A
 small
 smattering
 of
 hands
 of
 people


are
 undecided.
 Okay,
 Peter,
 you've
 got


an
 opportunity,
 it
 would
 seem,
 to


convince
 some
 people,
 uh,
 to
 come
 your


way.
 Uh,
 couple
 of
 more
 questions
 here.


How
 many
 people
 here
 either
 are
 or
 have


been
 snowbirds
 in
 the
 past?
 You
 have


gone
 south
 during
 the
 wintertime.
 I'm


seeing
 some
 hands
 at
 the
 back.
 Oh,
 okay.


Lots
 of
 hands.
 I'm
 guessing
 here
 about


half
 to
 twothirds
 of
 the
 hands
 went
 up


on
 that
 one.
 Let
 us
 uh
 continue
 if
 you


will
 to
 establish
 a
 bit
 of
 baseline.
 And


I'm
 going
 to
 get
 Stephen
 stand
 up
 if
 you


would
 because
 I
 want
 to
 introduce
 you


here.
 You
 are
 the
 president
 of
 Snowbird


Advisor
 and
 Snowbird
 Advisor
 Insurance.


Stephen
 Fine,
 thanks
 for
 coming
 up


today.
 You
 live
 you
 live
 not
 too
 far


from
 us
 at
 TVO,
 right?


>> Not
 far
 at
 all.


>> Okay.
 So,
 thanks
 for
 coming
 up
 to
 New


Market.
 Let's
 just
 do
 some
 basic


understanding
 of
 what
 we're
 talking


about
 today.
 Describe
 a
 typical


snowbird,
 if
 there
 is
 such
 a
 thing.


>> Well,
 a
 typical
 snowbird,
 it
 depends
 who


you're
 talking
 to.
 There
 are
 different


definitions,
 but
 we
 would
 say
 someone


who's
 typically
 retired,
 semi-retired,


uh,
 usually
 55
 plus
 and
 will
 go
 away
 to


warm
 weather
 destinations
 for
 between
 1


and
 6
 months
 over
 the
 winter.
 Usually


beginning
 in
 October
 and
 coming
 back
 in


April
 at
 sometime
 over
 that
 period.
 You


tend
 to
 think
 Florida,
 Arizona.
 Is
 that


basically
 it?


>> Uh,
 not
 really
 actually.
 Those
 are
 the


two
 big
 ones.
 Florida's
 number
 one,


Arizona's
 number
 two,
 but
 there
 are
 a


number
 of
 other
 places
 in
 the
 US,
 and


we've
 seen
 international
 destinations


growing
 as
 well.


>> Can
 you
 determine
 yet,
 I
 know
 we're


still
 a
 little
 while
 away
 from
 the
 time


when
 people
 traditionally
 leave.
 Can
 you


determine
 yet
 whether
 people
 are
 either


thinking
 about
 or
 actually
 boycotting


going
 to
 the
 States
 winter?
 Well,
 it's
 a


little
 early
 to
 tell
 right
 now.
 We're


hearing
 sentiment
 on
 both
 sides
 from
 our


members
 at
 this
 point.
 Um,
 I
 think
 that


we'll
 see
 some
 decline
 in
 US
 travel
 this


year
 among
 snowbirds,
 but
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 going
 to
 be
 as
 drastic
 as
 some
 of


the
 other
 travel
 numbers
 we're
 seeing


where
 travel's
 down
 by
 25
 or
 30%.
 We


anticipate
 it'll
 be
 more
 in
 the


potentially
 10
 to
 15%
 range,
 but
 again,


too
 early
 to
 tell.
 We
 won't
 really
 know


until
 the
 end
 of
 the
 season.
 And
 again,


not
 meaning
 to
 put
 you
 on
 the
 spot
 here


because
 maybe
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 number,


but
 if
 10
 to
 15%
 of
 snowbirds
 don't
 go,


do
 you
 know
 what
 dollar
 figure
 that


represents?


>> We
 don't
 have
 a
 dollar
 figure
 on
 that.


You
 know,
 we're
 not
 really
 sure.
 We
 we


don't
 we
 don't
 keep
 track
 of
 those
 kinds


of
 numbers,
 but
 it
 it
 would
 be


significant,
 but
 keep
 in
 mind
 as
 well,


you
 know,
 the
 majority
 of
 snowbirds


traditionally
 go
 to
 the
 US.
 About
 85
 to


90%
 of
 snowbirds
 go
 to
 the
 US


traditionally.
 So
 if
 you
 see
 a
 drop
 of


about
 10%,
 you're
 still
 getting
 the
 vast


majority
 of
 snowbirds
 going
 to
 the
 US


somewhere
 in
 the
 70
 75
 80%
 range


potentially.


>> Gotcha.
 Stephen,
 thanks
 for
 your
 help
 on


this.
 I
 may
 come
 back
 to
 you
 later
 in


the
 program
 if
 need
 be.
 Stephen,
 fine.


Everybody
 can
 have
 a
 little
 hand
 for


him.
 Thank
 you.
 [applause]


>> Okay,
 back
 to
 you
 two.
 Let
 us
 establish


our
 sides.
 Laura,
 you
 think
 it's
 okay
 to


go
 to
 the
 States
 and
 be
 a
 snowbird
 this


winter?


>> Not
 this
 winter,
 Steve.
 because


>> three
 main
 reasons
 and
 I
 can
 elaborate


on
 them
 as
 we
 go.
 The
 first
 is
 safety.


It
 changes
 by
 the
 weekend.
 I
 see
 a
 lot


of
 people
 nodding
 your
 heads
 in


agreement.
 For
 the
 first
 time
 in
 its


history,
 the
 United
 States
 is
 now
 on
 the


human
 rights
 watch
 because
 some
 things


are
 going
 on
 in
 that
 country
 that
 are


deeply
 disturbing.
 And
 given
 that
 the


relationship
 between
 the
 current


administration
 and
 Canada
 seems
 very


volatile,
 we
 don't
 know
 every
 morning


when
 we
 wake
 up
 what
 the
 sentiment
 will


be
 towards
 Canadians.
 I
 think
 it's


something
 that
 every
 snowbird
 and
 every


Canadian
 should
 consider.
 The
 second


thing
 is
 signal.
 I
 have
 a
 communications


company
 called
 Power
 Group
 and
 I
 always


teach
 my
 clients,
 you
 got
 to
 send
 a


clear
 signal
 through
 the
 noise.
 And
 we


know
 there
 is
 so
 much
 noise
 going
 on


coming
 out
 of
 the
 US,
 right?
 It
 takes


over
 our
 lives.
 So
 the
 signal
 that


Canada
 is
 trying
 to
 send
 is
 the
 same


signal
 that
 I
 say
 to
 my
 kids
 if
 they're


threatened.
 Right
 now,
 we're
 being


threatened
 with
 our
 sovereignty
 and
 our


economy.
 And
 I
 say
 to
 my
 kids,
 when
 a


bully
 threatens
 you,
 you
 stand
 up
 early


and
 often
 and
 always.
 You
 send
 a
 clear


signal
 and
 you
 do
 not
 change
 that.
 So


what
 signal
 does
 it
 send?
 If
 a
 million


snowbirds
 fly
 south
 and
 give
 billions
 in


tourism,
 it
 interrupts
 the
 signal
 that


Canada
 is
 trying
 to
 send.
 And
 the
 last


thing
 and
 the
 one
 I'm
 most
 passionate


about
 is
 sovereignty
 to
 our
 country
 in


the
 sense
 of
 patri
 of
 economic


patriotism.
 That
 means
 that
 we
 have
 to


put
 our
 economy
 first.
 It
 doesn't
 mean


nationalism
 where
 we
 block
 out
 other


investment
 around
 the
 world.
 It
 doesn't


mean
 closing
 our
 walls
 as
 a
 country,
 but


it
 means
 prioritizing
 Canadianbuilt


products.
 And
 millions
 of
 Canadians
 have


made
 sacrifices.
 Myself
 included.
 Can't


go
 see
 my
 family
 in
 Cleveland
 and


Florida.
 Can't
 do
 all
 the
 travel
 to
 the


US
 that
 I
 love
 to
 do.
 I'm
 doing
 it.
 I'm


trying
 not
 to
 buy
 US
 products
 out
 of
 a


sense
 of
 solidarity
 with
 millions
 of


Canadians,
 especially
 the
 ones
 who
 have


lost
 their
 jobs
 in
 the
 auto
 sector.
 What


would
 that
 say?
 If
 I
 decide
 willingly,


not
 because
 I
 have
 to
 go
 for
 some


emergency,
 but
 willingly
 to
 travel
 and


give
 my
 money
 to
 a
 country
 that
 is


currently
 threatening
 and
 bullying
 us.
 I


can't
 do
 it.
 Not
 this
 year.
 And
 I
 hope


all
 of
 the
 snowbirds
 give
 a
 long
 hard


thought
 to
 both
 their
 safety,
 the
 signal


they're
 sending,
 and
 solidarity
 with
 the


rest
 of
 Canada.
 Thank
 you.


>> Safety
 signal.
 Solidarity.


[applause]


Peter.
 We
 did
 mention
 it
 looked
 like
 it


was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 home
 game
 for


Laura
 here.
 You
 want
 to
 try
 making
 the


opposite
 argument?


>> Oh,
 I
 don't
 even
 want
 to
 try.
 [laughter]


No,
 I
 I
 do
 want
 to
 try.
 As
 a
 matter
 of


fact,
 I
 have
 the
 unique
 experience
 of


having
 been
 a
 snowbird
 myself
 for
 six
 or


seven
 years.
 And
 uh
 for
 a
 a
 reason
 that


had
 absolutely
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


wanting
 to
 be
 in
 the
 sun,
 the
 birth
 of
 a


grandson
 who
 was
 unexpected.
 uh
 four


years
 ago
 we
 sold
 in
 Florida
 and
 decided


to
 weather
 the
 storm
 and
 stay
 in
 Canada


and
 be
 in
 the
 cold.
 But
 the
 bottom
 line


is
 around
 the
 time
 we
 bought
 my
 doctor


said
 to
 me,
 you
 know,
 um
 you're
 getting


to
 be
 what
 we
 describe
 as
 elderly.


That's
 older.
 You're
 not
 old,
 but
 uh


you're
 not
 working
 regularly
 anymore.


You
 don't
 want
 to.
 And
 I
 might
 tell
 you


I'm
 three
 weeks
 away
 from
 being
 78
 now.


So
 the
 the
 concept
 of
 getting
 out
 of
 the


cold
 appeals
 to
 me.
 The
 concept
 of
 being


with
 my
 social
 peers,
 most
 of
 whom
 are


down
 there,
 u
 also
 appeals
 to
 me.
 If
 I


take
 a
 look
 at
 where
 I
 live,
 it
 happens


to
 be
 a
 condo
 complex
 in
 North
 York


where
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 people
 in
 the


building
 are
 of
 similar
 age
 to
 me.
 In


the
 summer,
 we
 see
 everybody
 because


they're
 gathered
 around
 the
 pool.
 In
 the


winter,
 they
 disappear.
 In
 fact,
 we've


already
 seen
 some
 people
 take
 off,
 watch


their
 cars
 go
 on
 the
 truck
 or
 them
 get


in
 if
 they
 want
 to
 drive.
 Uh,
 and


they're
 they're
 going
 the
 the
 building


empties
 out
 and
 we
 don't
 see
 them
 for
 an


entire
 season.
 So,
 I
 agree
 with
 Laura


when
 she
 says
 you
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 that


you
 cut
 through
 the
 noise
 and
 get
 onto


the
 signal.
 The
 noise
 to
 me
 is
 what


everybody
 is
 saying
 about
 whether
 the


United
 States
 is
 safe.
 Look,
 we
 went
 to


Florida.
 60%
 of
 people
 there
 have
 guns


in
 their
 cars.
 Now
 they're
 an
 open
 carry


state.
 At least
 you
 know
 who
 has
 one.


But
 the
 bottom
 line
 is
 we
 knew
 where
 to


go
 and
 we
 knew
 where
 not
 to
 go.
 Um
 we


like
 the
 idea
 of
 wearing
 light
 clothing,


staying
 in
 shorts
 year
 round.
 That's
 our


reason
 for
 wanting
 to
 go
 and
 I
 don't


think
 it
 has
 much
 to
 do
 with
 Donald


Trump
 or
 the
 cost
 of
 money.


>> But
 just
 to
 be
 clear,
 you
 will
 go
 south


this
 weekend.


>> I
 I
 would
 if
 I
 h
 I'm
 not
 a
 snowbird


anymore.
 So
 I
 I
 will
 go
 to
 Florida,
 but


it'll
 be
 for
 one
 or
 two
 weeks.
 We'll


stay
 with
 relatives.
 And
 that's
 another


thing
 I
 should
 say.
 Snowbirds
 often


locate
 in
 areas
 where
 they
 have
 many


friends
 and
 relatives.
 South
 Florida
 is


a
 place
 where
 we
 have
 many
 friends
 and


relatives.
 And
 regardless
 of
 whether
 we


were
 or
 weren't
 snowbirds,
 and


regardless
 of
 whether
 there
 were
 a
 tiff


going
 on
 between
 the
 United
 States
 and


Canada,
 or
 whether
 the
 dollar
 is
 going


at
 a$140,
 we'd
 be
 there.
 So
 sometime
 in


January
 or
 February,
 you'll
 find
 me


wandering
 the
 uh
 the
 town
 center
 on


Glades
 Road
 in
 Boca
 Raton.


>> It's
 a
 little
 more
 than
 a
 tiff
 that's


going
 on
 between
 Canada
 and
 the
 United


States.


>> You
 could
 say
 that.


>> You
 could
 Well,
 I
 just
 did.
 I
 mean,
 and


and
 it
 because
 it
 is
 it
 is
 more
 than
 a


tiff.


>> It
 is.
 But
 the
 way
 I
 see
 it,
 I
 didn't


get
 a
 vote.
 So
 I
 didn't
 vote
 for
 Trump


and
 I
 didn't
 vote
 against
 Trump.
 I
 voted


for
 Carney
 or
 I
 voted
 for
 PV.
 It
 doesn't


matter
 which
 one
 it
 was.
 I'm
 a
 Canadian.


Canadians
 go
 to
 Florida,
 they
 go
 to


Arizona,
 they
 go
 to
 California.
 And


sometimes
 they
 decide
 to
 go
 further
 a


field,
 which
 my
 wife
 and
 I
 have


discussed
 doing
 as
 well
 this
 winter.
 If


we
 can
 afford
 it
 and
 the
 time
 is
 there,


I
 think
 the
 time
 will
 be
 there.
 Maybe


we'll
 go
 to
 Barbados.
 Maybe
 we'll
 go
 to


the
 Bahamas.
 But
 we're
 not
 boycotting


the
 United
 States.
 We
 don't
 have
 a


problem
 with
 the
 people
 of
 the
 United


States.
 I
 believe
 our
 government
 has
 a


problem
 with
 the
 government
 of
 the


United
 States
 and
 as
 these
 things
 tend


to
 settle,
 we
 will
 settle
 at
 some
 point


and
 in
 some
 way
 and
 it'll
 be
 okay
 again.


>> Laura,
 could
 you
 speak
 to
 that
 angle


because
 Peter
 makes
 a
 good
 point?
 Uh,


every
 American
 I've
 ever
 spoken
 to
 uh


online,
 in
 person,
 whatever,
 say,


>> you
 know,
 we're
 kind
 of
 sorry
 about
 all


this.
 Yeah.


>> You
 know
 that
 we
 Americans
 don't
 have
 a


problem
 with
 you
 Canadians.
 very
 much
 is


a
 president
 of
 the
 United
 States
 and
 a


prime
 minister
 of
 Canada
 thing.
 Does


that
 make
 you
 bevel
 your
 edges
 a
 bit
 on


this?


>> I
 love
 Americans.
 In
 fact,
 our
 second


biggest
 audience
 for
 the
 O
 show,
 even


though
 we're
 a
 Canadian
 National


Prodemocracy
 podcast,
 are
 Americans.
 I


hear
 from
 them
 all
 the
 time
 and
 they're


in
 solidarity
 with
 us.
 They're
 in


solidarity
 with
 what
 we're
 doing.
 They


hate
 what's
 happening.
 They
 hate
 the


disruption.
 I
 used
 to
 run
 a
 chamber
 of


commerce
 in
 Oakville.
 So
 much
 of
 my


members
 business
 was
 reliant
 on
 our


biggest
 trading
 partner.
 This
 is


devastating.
 This
 is
 not
 just
 a
 tiff.


This
 is
 just
 not,
 you
 know,
 some
 tariffs


on
 softwood
 lumber
 or
 supply
 chain


issues
 around
 dairy.
 This
 is
 aggressive


tariff
 setting
 disrupting
 our
 trade


agreement
 that
 we
 worked
 so
 hard
 on
 a


number
 of
 years
 ago
 in
 the
 first
 Trump


administration
 and
 saying
 to
 Canadian


businesses,
 you
 don't
 know
 if
 you're


going
 to
 have
 access
 to
 our
 market.
 You


don't
 know
 what's
 going
 to
 happen.
 You


don't
 know
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 reliable


for
 you.
 You
 could
 wake
 up
 in
 the


morning
 and
 find
 out
 there's
 a
 10%
 extra


tariff
 across
 the
 board.
 So
 that's


called
 a
 trade
 war.
 It's
 not
 a
 tiff.
 And


the
 second
 thing
 is
 I
 would
 love
 to


visit
 my
 family
 in
 Cleveland
 like
 I
 do


for
 St.
 Patrick's
 Day
 or
 go
 down
 and
 see


my
 family
 in
 Florida.
 I've
 worked
 in


Texas.
 I
 love
 to
 go
 to
 the
 US.
 It's
 got


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 gun
 open
 carrier


closed
 although
 I
 have
 a
 good
 Nashville


story
 I
 can
 tell.
 But
 it's
 about
 the


fact
 that
 right
 now
 the
 US
 is
 in
 a


destabil
 position.
 And
 we'll
 probably


talk
 later
 about
 democracy
 and
 the
 rest


of
 it,
 but
 it
 is
 definitely
 not
 a
 stable


nation
 the
 way
 we're
 used
 to.
 And
 so
 I


think
 for
 Canadians,
 you
 can
 love
 your


American
 friends
 and
 family.
 You
 can


connect
 with
 them
 over
 Zoom.
 You
 can
 say


to
 them,
 I
 sure
 hope
 that
 I'm
 going
 to


be
 back
 there
 next
 year.
 But
 this


winter,
 this
 is
 what
 my
 family
 does.


We're
 going
 to
 Punchana,
 and
 we
 love


going
 to
 Mexico
 like
 we
 did
 last
 winter.


There
 are
 other
 places
 where
 snowbirds


can
 spend
 their
 money,
 maybe
 meet
 some


new
 friends
 before
 they
 go
 back
 to
 their


communities
 they're
 so
 used
 to.


>> Okay,
 Peter,
 come
 on
 back.


>> Well,
 it's
 interesting
 that
 you
 use
 the


word
 an
 unstable
 or
 destabilized
 place


right
 now.
 What
 I
 speak
 to
 the
 United


States,
 I
 suppose,
 three
 or
 four
 times
 a


week
 because
 we
 have
 close
 enough
 people


in
 the
 states
 that
 I
 want
 to
 do
 that
 or


they
 do
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 consider


themselves
 unstable
 at
 all.
 Some
 of
 them


like
 their
 president,
 some
 of
 them
 don't


like
 their
 president,
 but
 none
 of
 them


feel
 that
 they're
 in
 any
 danger.
 We're


the
 ones
 who
 think
 it's
 it's
 unstable.


And
 from
 our
 perspective,
 I
 suppose
 I


could
 agree
 with
 that
 point
 of
 view.


Having
 said
 that,
 I'm
 the
 one
 who
 has
 to


decide
 if
 I'm
 a
 snowbird
 whether
 I
 want


to
 be
 there
 or
 not.
 And
 whether
 that


instability
 that
 I
 perceive
 is
 there
 is


going
 to
 be
 injurious
 to
 me.
 I
 don't


think
 it
 is.


>> Let's
 look
 around
 this
 audience.
 Has


anybody
 got
 a
 point
 they
 want
 to
 make
 on


this
 issue?
 Can
 I
 get
 somebody
 to
 wait


over
 here?
 Sheldon,
 follow
 me
 if
 you


would.
 Oh,
 hi.
 I
 know
 who
 you
 are.
 Go


ahead.
 Introduce
 yourself
 to
 the
 gang.


>> How
 are
 you?
 John
 Taylor.
 I'm
 the
 mayor


of
 New
 Market.
 And
 uh
 [applause]


I
 think
 the
 message
 I
 want
 to
 share
 is


is
 oddly
 in
 between.
 Well,
 maybe
 that


sounds
 like
 a
 politician
 actually.
 Uh
 my


point
 is
 is
 that
 I
 think
 every
 Canadian


should
 be
 doing
 everything
 they
 can
 to


not
 spend
 money
 in
 the
 US
 economy
 and


that
 includes
 going
 south.


The
 point
 I
 want
 to
 make
 though
 is
 there


is
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 in
 this
 world
 right


now
 that
 divide
 us.
 And
 so
 be
 thoughtful


and
 kind
 to
 your
 neighbors.
 Don't
 judge


them.
 Don't
 assume
 you
 know
 their
 whole


story.
 There
 are
 unique
 circumstances


uh
 why
 some
 people
 may
 need
 to
 travel
 to


the
 United
 States,
 may
 want
 to
 travel


the
 United
 States.
 I
 encourage
 us
 all
 to


explore
 every
 way
 to
 not
 do
 it,
 but
 at


the
 same
 time,
 let's
 do
 everything
 we


can
 to
 not
 be
 divided
 anymore
 or
 as


little
 as
 we
 can.
 Strong
 opinions,
 good


intentions,
 but
 less
 division.


>> Well,
 that's
 what
 we
 do
 here.
 We
 have,


you
 know,
 strong
 engaging


interchange
 on
 the
 issues,
 but
 we're
 all


being
 very
 civil
 with
 each
 other.
 Let
 me


ask
 you
 this,
 though.
 We've
 had
 some


discussion
 here
 about,
 you
 know,
 if
 you


have
 a
 chance
 to
 go
 somewhere
 for
 2


weeks,
 that's
 different
 from
 I
 own
 a


place
 in
 Arizona
 and
 to
 have
 it
 sit


there
 empty
 for
 the
 whole
 year
 is
 really


difficult
 and
 a
 waste
 of
 money.
 How


would
 you
 respond
 to
 that?


>> I
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 hard.
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 of
 like
 people
 and
 I've
 heard
 life


experiences.
 I
 mean,
 if
 I'm
 going
 away


for
 two
 weeks
 or
 I
 wish
 a
 week,
 uh
 I
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 United
 States
 because


that's
 simply
 a
 vacation.
 Maybe
 now
 how


what
 happens
 if
 my
 niece
 is
 getting


married
 or
 what
 happens
 if
 you
 know
 not


for
 me
 but
 you've
 got
 it
 like
 you
 said


somebody
 down
 the
 street
 from
 you
 they


just
 a
 few
 couple
 years
 ago
 invested
 in


and
 bought
 their
 dream
 place
 and
 are


they
 to
 leave
 it
 sitting
 empty
 for
 years


I
 don't
 know
 but
 maybe
 they
 could
 go
 a


lot
 less
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 maybe


reducing
 your
 carbon
 footprint
 I
 I'll


eat
 a
 little
 less
 meat
 you
 know
 and
 I'll


try
 to
 do
 my
 part
 um
 so
 some
 people's


circumstances
 will
 be
 a
 little
 different


I
 think
 we
 should
 all
 do
 everything
 we


can
 to
 send
 a
 strong
 message
 to
 impact


with
 a
 strong
 message
 but
 let's
 be
 a


little
 bit
 patient
 that
 we
 don't
 know


our
 neighbors
 full
 story.


>> Fair
 enough.
 Your
 worship.
 Thank
 you
 and


thanks
 for
 having
 us
 here
 today.
 This
 is


great.
 Yeah.
 Anybody
 else?
 Anybody
 else


want
 in?
 Laura,
 I
 think
 I
 I
 I
 think
 I


want
 you
 to
 speak
 to
 this
 issue
 of


there's
 a
 big
 difference
 between
 going


somewhere
 for
 two
 weeks
 and
 having
 a


place
 that
 you
 might
 have
 gone
 to
 for


four
 months
 that
 you've
 put
 your
 life


savings
 into
 and
 has
 a
 real
 special


place
 in
 your
 heart.
 How
 do
 you
 deal


with
 that
 conundrum?


>> It's
 rough.
 It's
 a
 sacrifice.
 And
 to
 my


colleagueu's
 point,
 he
 has
 community


down
 there
 that
 he
 goes
 to
 visit.
 I
 have


snowbirds
 in
 my
 family
 who
 moved
 from


their
 Texas
 location
 to
 Mexico
 now.
 Um,


and
 you
 know,
 they're
 they're
 loving
 the


new
 cultural
 experience,
 but
 they
 had
 to


leave
 behind
 a
 community
 they
 were
 with


for
 a
 number
 of
 years
 that
 they
 looked


forward
 to
 going
 and
 seeing.
 But
 I
 think


in
 the
 long
 course
 of
 things,
 we
 are
 in


an
 unprecedented
 moment.
 We
 haven't
 had


threats
 to
 Canada
 sovereignty
 by
 America


in
 about
 200
 years
 or
 so.
 This
 is


something
 that
 we
 have
 to
 take


seriously.
 It's
 not
 just
 about


necessarily
 the
 safety
 of
 your


particular
 community
 enclave,
 which
 you


talk
 to
 Americans
 all
 the
 time.
 I
 have


friends
 from
 America.
 They
 feel
 okay


where
 they
 are,
 but
 they
 don't
 know


exactly
 how
 it's
 going
 to
 remain.
 And
 I


don't
 know
 exactly
 how
 Americans
 are


going
 to
 continue
 to
 feel
 about
 Canada


as
 the
 rhetoric
 escalates
 or
 as
 things


change.
 We
 just
 don't
 know.
 So
 when
 I


say
 instability,
 I
 don't
 mean


permanently
 terrible.
 Don't
 go
 to
 the
 US


because
 I
 want
 to
 get
 back
 there.
 I
 love


it.
 I'm
 bitter
 that
 I
 couldn't
 go
 on
 my


holidays
 this
 year.
 Uh
 however,
 we
 don't


know.
 And
 until
 we
 feel
 a
 sense
 of
 okay


this
 is
 okay
 for
 me
 to
 go
 back
 I
 think


we
 should
 give
 it
 serious
 thought
 like


the
 mayor
 said
 also
 though
 it's
 a


sacrifice
 right
 think
 of
 the
 sacrifice


of
 the
 auto
 workers
 think
 of
 the


sacrifices
 of
 small
 businesses
 who
 have


lost
 major
 market
 share
 in
 the
 US
 there


are
 people
 sacrificing
 all
 the
 time
 and


if
 so
 subleasasing
 or
 not
 being
 able
 to


use
 your
 rental
 property
 not
 being
 able


to
 see
 your
 friends
 for
 a
 year
 is
 the


sacrifice
 that
 snowbirds
 have
 to
 do
 I


think
 you
 have
 to
 think
 strongly
 about


that.
 It
 sucks,
 if
 I
 can
 say
 that,


Steve,
 but
 it
 is
 how
 it
 is
 right
 now.


So,
 let's
 be
 together
 as
 Canadians.


Let's
 not
 divide
 amongst
 ourselves


domestically
 or
 otherwise.
 And
 let's


continue
 to
 send
 a
 strong,
 clear
 signal,


even
 if
 sometimes
 it's
 scary
 and
 we're


worried
 about
 what
 it's
 going
 to
 turn


into.
 We
 can't
 be
 bullied
 and
 we
 can't


back
 down.
 I
 want
 to
 sus
 out
 Peter's


position
 a
 little
 more
 on
 this,
 which
 is


to
 say
 certainly
 when
 you
 were
 in


politics,
 you
 had
 your
 ear
 to
 the
 ground


very
 intensely
 to
 know
 what
 your


constituents
 believed
 about
 something.


Uh
 I
 know
 you
 are
 watching
 now
 with


interest
 as
 from
 time
 to
 time
 Canadians


boo
 the
 Star
 Spangled
 Banner
 when
 they


hear
 it
 at
 a
 sporting
 event.
 Although


interestingly,
 we
 didn't
 hear
 any
 of


that
 in
 the
 first
 two
 games
 of
 the
 World


Series.
 We
 noticed
 that
 was
 that
 was
 of


interest.
 Um


is
 there
 a
 part
 of
 you


that
 feels
 just
 the
 slightest
 bit
 it


would
 be
 disloyal
 somehow
 to
 go
 down
 to


the
 states
 right
 now.


>> There's
 a
 part
 of
 me
 that
 feels
 pissed


off
 that
 we
 got
 into
 this
 situation,
 but


we
 didn't
 put
 ourselves
 in
 this


situation.
 It
 just
 happened.
 If
 we
 were


having
 a
 debate
 about
 Trump,
 which
 would


go
 ours
 and
 is
 not
 what
 this
 is
 about.


We
 could
 talk
 about
 the
 fact
 that
 the


Americans
 I
 speak
 to
 who
 support
 Trump,


and
 I
 speak
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 people,


say,
 "Look,
 we're
 happy.
 He
 said
 he
 was


going
 to
 do
 these
 things.
 They
 are


things
 that
 needed
 to
 be
 done.
 We


support
 what
 he's
 doing.
 That's
 what
 we


elected
 him
 to
 do.
 I'm
 not
 taking
 that


position,
 but
 they
 are,
 which
 is
 why


Americans,
 for
 the
 most
 part,
 feel
 safe.


On
 the
 other
 hand,
 I've
 been
 on
 recently


a
 cruise
 ship
 where
 the
 first
 people
 we


met
 the
 first
 morning
 that
 we
 woke
 up


happened
 to
 be
 from
 the
 left
 coast
 as


they
 call
 it.
 And
 uh
 we
 introduced


ourselves,
 they
 introduced
 themselves.


We
 both
 talked
 about
 where
 we
 came
 from,


which
 is
 what
 you
 the
 first
 words
 that


come
 out
 of
 your
 mouth
 when
 you
 meet


people
 who
 are
 strangers
 on
 a
 a


vacation.
 And
 uh
 we're
 the
 we're
 the


Shermans
 from
 Toronto.
 We're
 the
 whoever


they
 were
 from
 Portland,
 Oregon.
 You're


from
 Toronto.
 We're
 so
 sorry.
 Okay.
 So,


I
 appreciated
 that,
 but
 I
 said,
 you


don't
 have
 to
 be
 sorry.
 I
 want
 to
 bring


it
 back
 to
 a
 conversation
 that
 is
 less


politically
 pointed.
 So,
 I
 I
 gave
 you


the
 qualified
 yes.
 Of
 course,
 my
 ear
 to


the
 ground
 tells
 me,
 yeah,
 I'm
 I'm
 not


happy
 with
 the
 situation.
 Having
 said


that,
 I
 have
 to
 make
 do
 with
 it.
 And


when
 I
 mentioned
 that
 I
 am
 in
 the


category
 that's
 described
 by
 my


physician
 charitably
 as
 uh
 elderly,
 I


don't
 know
 how
 many
 more
 times
 I'm
 going


to
 see
 my
 85year-old
 brother-in-law
 or


my
 75year-old
 sister-in-law


>> who
 live
 where


>> in
 Boca
 Raton
 permanently.
 They
 come
 up


here,
 we
 go
 down
 there
 for
 family


events.
 So
 I'll
 tell
 you
 two
 stories


about
 that.
 One
 is
 maybe
 it's
 four
 more


times
 in
 our
 lives
 and
 maybe
 if
 I
 don't


go
 this
 year
 it's
 three.
 So
 I
 have
 to


keep
 that
 in
 mind.
 Second
 thing,
 we
 had


a
 family
 event
 in
 July
 and
 more
 than


just
 those
 aging
 in-laws
 came.
 One
 of


the
 the
 daughters,
 my
 niece
 came.
 She's


in
 her
 early
 40s.
 She
 has
 three
 kids,


very
 well
 educated,
 very
 smart,
 and
 by


the
 way,
 a
 dual
 citizen
 born
 in
 Canada.


And
 she
 said,
 I
 uh
 I
 said
 to
 her,
 you


know,
 a
 lot
 of
 Canadians
 won't
 go
 to
 the


States
 these
 days.
 And
 she
 said,
 "And


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 Americans
 who
 won't


go
 to
 Canada,
 and
 I'm
 one
 of
 them.
 and


I'm
 here
 because
 this
 is
 a
 family
 event.


And
 I
 said,
 "Why
 wouldn't
 you
 go
 to


Canada?"
 She
 said,
 "Because
 it's
 a
 nasty


little
 country
 that
 just
 wants
 to
 snub


us."
 So
 there's
 the
 other
 side.


Can
 I
 ask
 you
 about
 Ohio?
 I
 mean,
 isn't


there
 a
 part
 of
 you
 that
 feels
 I


shouldn't
 be
 giving
 Trump
 the
 victory
 by


not
 going
 to
 Ohio?
 Why
 am
 I
 depriving


myself
 of
 seeing
 family
 I
 love?
 Do


>> you
 know
 I
 haven't
 brought
 up
 the
 T-word


yet.
 You
 have
 a
 couple
 of
 times,
 but
 I'm


happy.
 Is
 that
 tariffs
 or
 trade?


>> That
 would
 be
 Trump.


>> Trump,
 the
 third
 one.


>> But
 I'm
 I'm
 happy
 to
 talk
 Trump
 all
 day,


as
 my
 podcast
 would
 indicate.
 Listen,
 I


have
 family
 in
 Ohio.
 You
 know
 what
 they


did
 this
 summer?
 They
 got
 in
 a
 couple
 of


vans
 and
 came
 up
 to
 our
 house.
 And
 the


entire
 time,
 every
 time
 we
 had
 a
 lot
 of


people
 there.
 Every
 time
 I
 walked
 by
 the


picnic
 table,
 they
 said,
 "Laura,
 Laura,


Laura,
 we're
 so
 sorry
 about
 what's


happening.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 we
 should


do?
 We're
 in
 Ohio."
 [laughter]


And
 I'm
 like,
 "You
 know
 what?
 Just
 keep


doing
 what
 you're
 doing,
 right?
 um
 they


care
 about
 us.
 They
 had
 no
 problem


coming
 to
 Canada.
 I
 also
 want
 to
 say


though,
 if
 as
 snowbirds
 you
 decide
 to,


you
 know,
 try
 something
 else
 like
 Mexico


or
 the
 Dominican
 Republic,
 I've
 been
 to


both
 those
 places
 since
 all
 this
 madness


started.
 And
 every
 time
 they
 say,
 you


know,
 where
 are
 you
 from?
 And
 people
 go,


Canada.
 Applause
 from
 the
 Americans


there,
 from
 the
 Mexicans,
 from
 the


people
 in
 the
 Dominican,
 from
 the
 people


in
 Europe
 who
 are
 there.
 They
 absolutely


see
 Canada
 as
 leading
 the
 charge
 for


democracy,
 for
 independence,
 for
 the


rule
 of
 law,
 for
 fairness.
 They
 don't


see
 us
 as
 a
 nasty
 little
 country.
 They


see
 us
 as
 leading
 the
 tip
 of
 the
 spear


against
 what
 seems
 to
 be
 very
 unfair


global
 trade
 practices.
 And
 I
 got
 to


tell
 you,
 it
 feels
 really
 good
 to
 have


people
 from
 around
 the
 world
 clap
 for


you,
 talk
 to
 you,
 and
 say,
 "Keep
 it


going,
 Canada.
 The
 world
 is
 watching."


Let
 me
 go
 to
 you
 get
 applause
 every
 time


you
 say
 something.
 That's
 very


[applause]


that
 must
 be
 nice.
 It's
 all
 true.


>> Can
 I
 just
 get
 a
 sense
 of
 the
 audience


here?
 Donald
 Trump
 became
 the
 president


in
 January.
 Who
 here
 has
 tried
 to
 go
 to


the
 United
 States
 since
 Trump
 became


president?
 Hands
 up.


Okay,
 very
 few
 hands
 going
 up
 right
 now.


Next
 question.
 Anybody
 have
 trouble


getting
 over
 the
 border?
 Anybody
 have


sort
 of
 more
 than
 usual
 difficulty


getting
 over
 the
 border?
 a
 security


officer
 who
 maybe
 No,
 I'm
 seeing
 a
 lot


of
 heads
 shaking.
 Nobody
 had
 any


difficulty
 at
 all.
 Oh,
 just
 a
 second


here.
 Hang
 on.
 I
 see
 one
 hand
 in
 the


back.
 Sir,
 would
 you
 mind
 standing
 for
 a


second?
 I'd
 love
 to
 hear
 the
 story.
 You


yelled
 out,
 "Your
 son."
 Yes.
 What


happened?


>> He
 and
 his
 family
 were
 going
 to


Pittsburgh
 uh
 because
 the
 Pittsburgh


Pirates
 organization
 were
 hosting
 a
 fun


event
 for
 young
 ball
 players.
 Our


nephew,
 our
 our
 grandson,
 his


10-year-old,
 plays
 AAA
 ball.
 He
 got
 to


Buffalo
 and
 he
 he's
 with
 a
 major
 bank


>> and
 they
 were
 driving
 down.
 I
 assume


>> they
 were
 driving
 and
 the
 security
 guard


or
 the
 customs
 guy
 was
 totally
 rude
 to


him.
 Like
 so
 rude.
 Adam
 said,
 "If
 I


didn't
 be
 if
 I
 wasn't
 going
 to
 New
 York


twice
 a
 month,
 I'd
 have
 punched
 the
 son


of
 a
 right
 in
 the
 face."


>> Can
 you
 say
 that
 on
 tell
 I
 guess
 he
 just


did.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 you
 know,
 if
 if
 our
 uh


manager
 of
 the
 Blue
 Jays
 can
 say
 the


What
 a
 little
 potty
 mouth
 he
 has
 these


days,
 isn't
 it?
 Although
 it's
 kind
 of


nice
 to
 see.
 Okay,
 so
 did
 this
 affect
 or


change
 your
 view
 of
 what's
 going
 on


right
 now?


>> Well,
 we
 have
 never
 had
 a
 problem


because
 we've
 gone
 for
 years
 to
 Amelia


Island
 and
 we
 have
 a
 wonderful


experience.
 It's
 just
 uh
 you
 cross
 I
 95


from
 Georgia
 into
 Florida.
 It's
 the


first
 two
 exits
 and
 we
 met
 some
 great


Americans
 number
 of
 years
 ago
 who


introduced
 us
 and
 we
 have
 many
 close


cherished
 American
 friends
 there.
 But


it's
 uh
 it's
 it's
 getting
 there.


>> So
 the
 the
 the
 border
 situation
 that


your
 son
 and
 grandson,
 is
 that
 who
 it


was,
 that
 they
 experienced,
 has
 it


turned
 them
 off
 the
 United
 States?


>> Oh,
 it
 left
 them
 in
 a
 very
 sour
 mood.


Yeah,
 it
 depends
 where
 you
 go.
 We
 always


crossed
 at
 Lewon
 and
 the
 folks
 at
 Lewon


are
 for
 the
 most
 part
 very
 delightful


customs
 people.


>> What
 are
 your
 plans
 over
 the
 next


several
 months?
 Well,
 we
 are
 not
 going.


We
 we
 went
 for
 years
 and
 uh
 due
 to


circumstances
 beyond
 our
 control,


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 politics,
 we
 were


only
 able
 to
 go
 for
 a
 month
 this
 year


and
 we
 just
 decided
 we
 have
 we
 have


Nexus
 cards.


We've
 been
 fingerprinted.
 We've
 had


extensive
 interviews
 to
 get
 those
 cards


and
 uh
 Mr.
 T
 says,
 "Screw
 the
 cards.


You're
 going
 to
 register
 again."
 So


>> and
 we're
 aliens.


>> You're
 aliens.
 What
 do
 you
 mean?


>> Well,
 they
 he
 considers
 us
 aliens.


>> I
 see.
 Yes.
 Yes.


>> I've
 got
 three
 cousins.
 They're
 all


Americans.
 So
 I've
 been
 to
 the
 US
 many


times.
 I've
 got
 a
 good
 view.
 I
 feel
 very


good
 about
 them.
 What
 they're
 going


through
 now
 is


they're
 a
 dangerous
 country.


>> Gotcha.
 Thank
 you
 for
 sharing
 that.
 Much


appreciated.
 I
 want
 to
 go
 to
 Stephen.


Can
 I
 get
 you
 again
 here?
 Stephen
 Fines,


our
 snowbird
 expert
 here.
 Can
 you
 tell


me
 first
 of
 all,
 because
 a
 a
 lot
 of
 what


I
 hear
 about
 this
 is
 anecdotal
 and
 you


will
 know
 the
 actual
 facts
 and
 we
 like


to
 deal
 with
 empirically
 provable
 facts.


I'm
 hearing
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 more


nastiness
 trying
 to
 cross
 the
 border


these
 days,
 including
 fingerprinting
 and


a
 kind
 of
 a,
 you
 know,
 the
 third
 degree


of
 questioning
 that
 you
 never
 would
 have


had
 before
 Trump
 became
 president.
 True


or
 false?


>> It's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 both.


uh
 fingerprinting
 is
 not
 required
 when


you
 go
 over
 the
 border.
 Now,
 we've
 heard


of
 some
 incidents
 happening
 over
 the


last
 week
 or
 so
 where
 some
 individuals


have
 been
 required
 to
 go
 through


biometrics
 when
 they're
 crossing
 the


land
 border
 into
 the
 US.
 So,
 that
 would


mean
 getting
 your
 photograph
 taken.
 That


would
 mean
 fingerprinting.
 Now,
 these


the
 this
 is
 not
 the
 official
 policy.
 Not


everybody
 who
 goes
 over
 the
 border
 needs


to
 be
 fingerprinted.
 Unfortunately,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 confusion
 and
 a
 lot
 of


inconsistency
 at
 the
 border
 right
 now.


It's
 primarily
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 into


all
 the
 different
 rules
 because
 we
 could


spend
 the
 next
 hour
 talking
 about
 it.
 We


have
 some
 information
 about
 that
 on
 our


website.
 We
 try
 to
 keep
 people
 updated.


It's
 changing
 regularly,
 but
 most
 uh


individuals
 will
 just
 go
 across
 the


border
 as
 they
 normally
 would
 have
 in


the
 past
 and
 then
 register
 online
 with


US
 citizenship
 and
 immigration
 services


online.
 There's
 no
 fee
 to
 do
 that.
 There


are
 no
 biometric
 requirements,
 no


fingerprinting
 required.
 Now,
 some


Canadians
 are
 asking
 for
 what's
 called


an
 I94
 form
 at
 the
 border.
 And
 if
 you


ask
 for
 that,
 then
 you
 do
 need
 to
 go


through
 biometrics.


>> What
 is
 that?
 A
 99 I94.


>> It's
 a
 it's
 a
 record
 of
 entry
 into
 the


US.
 And
 usually,
 you
 don't
 need
 it
 at


the
 border
 or
 at
 at
 the
 land
 border.


Historically,
 you
 haven't
 or
 it's
 been


recorded
 automatically,
 but
 in
 most


cases,
 you're
 not
 issued
 one.
 When
 you


go
 to
 the
 to
 the
 US,
 you
 wouldn't
 even


know
 that
 you
 were
 issued
 one
 in
 the


past.
 Um
 and
 but
 now
 if
 you
 go
 down
 and


you
 ask
 for
 one
 then
 you
 will
 have
 to


pay
 a
 fee
 for
 that.
 You
 will
 go
 through


biometrics.
 If
 you
 don't
 ask
 for
 it
 in


most
 cases
 you
 will
 just
 go
 through
 the


border
 and
 then
 you
 can
 register
 once


you're
 on
 the
 other
 side
 if
 you're


staying
 for
 30
 days
 or
 more.
 If
 you're


not
 staying
 for
 30
 days
 or
 more
 you


don't
 need
 to
 register
 at
 all.
 What's


happened
 in
 the
 last
 week
 or
 so
 is
 there


have
 been
 some
 reported
 um
 uh
 incidents


of
 Canadians
 where
 the
 uh
 US
 Customs
 and


uh
 Border
 Patrol
 officers
 have
 required


them
 to
 get
 an
 I94
 at
 the
 border
 and
 go


through
 biometrics.
 So
 that's
 where


there's
 some
 confusion
 right
 now.
 So


>> and
 that
 requirement
 should
 not
 be
 in


place.


>> It
 should
 not
 be
 in
 place.
 uh
 the
 CBP


officers
 should
 not
 be
 requiring


Canadians
 to
 uh
 to
 to
 obtain
 an
 I9.


>> So
 why
 are
 they?


>> We're
 trying
 to
 figure
 that
 out
 as
 well.


There
 is
 some
 confusion,
 but
 in
 most


cases
 that
 is
 not
 happening
 and
 that
 is


not
 the
 official
 policy
 and
 we
 are


working
 through
 to
 get
 uh
 statements


from
 official
 sources
 so
 that
 we
 can


share
 that.
 Um,
 but
 what
 snowbirds
 need


to
 know
 right
 now
 if
 they're
 going
 down


for
 30
 days
 or
 more
 and
 they're
 driving


to
 the
 US
 is
 be
 prepared
 to
 register
 in


a
 fashion
 which
 you
 may
 not
 have


anticipated
 having
 to
 register
 in


before.
 So
 be
 open.
 Um,
 go
 along
 with


the
 CBP
 officer's
 recommendation,


whatever
 it
 may
 be.
 Don't
 ask
 for
 an


I94.
 They
 may
 require
 you
 to
 get
 one,


but
 in
 most
 cases
 you
 won't
 have
 to.
 Uh,


but
 what
 we
 have
 not
 heard
 is
 people


being
 rejected
 at
 the
 border.
 uh
 people


get
 through,
 you
 may
 just
 have
 to


register
 in
 a
 way
 that
 you
 hadn't


anticipated
 before.


>> Okay,
 Stephen,
 thank
 you
 for
 that.
 I


wonder,
 Laura,
 in
 an
 era
 of
 Trump,
 it
 is


always
 possible
 to
 interpret
 that


whatever
 stuff
 you
 run
 into
 at
 the


border
 is
 because
 the
 president
 has


suddenly
 put
 a
 new
 edict
 on
 Canadians


and
 is
 trying
 to
 make
 our
 life


difficult.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 also
 possible


that
 it
 could
 just
 be
 what
 it
 always
 is,


which
 is
 sometimes
 border
 officials
 get


up
 on
 the
 wrong
 side
 of
 the
 bed
 and


they're
 not
 having
 a
 good
 day
 and
 they


take
 it
 out
 on
 you.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 fair


to
 say,
 isn't
 it?


>> It's
 possible,
 but
 I
 have
 had
 a
 chance


to
 travel
 a
 bit
 and
 worked
 in
 Europe
 and


in
 Asia,
 and
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 listening
 to


you
 just
 now
 talking
 about
 the
 biometric


scan
 and
 the
 rest
 of
 it,
 it's
 madness.


This
 is
 not
 the
 America
 that
 we
 pop
 over


and
 go
 shopping
 at
 the
 outlet
 malls,


right,
 that
 we've
 been
 doing
 for
 years


and
 years.
 And
 who
 knows
 by
 the
 time,


you
 know,
 people
 are
 watching
 and


listening
 to
 this
 what
 it'll
 be
 then.


The
 fact
 that
 you
 represent
 the


organization
 of
 snowbirds
 or
 you
 do


insurance
 for
 snowbirds
 and
 you're


talking
 about
 not
 understanding
 the


confusing
 practices
 that
 some
 are


reporting
 back
 is
 the
 point
 right
 now.


Whether
 it's
 coming
 right
 from
 the


office
 of
 Donald
 Trump
 because
 he
 woke


up
 angry
 or
 whether
 it
 is
 some


overzealous
 border
 guard
 or
 whether
 it's


somebody
 who's
 tired
 and
 doesn't
 like


how
 Canadians
 have
 been,
 you
 know,
 not


supporting
 their
 local
 stores
 across
 the


border
 in
 the
 town
 they
 live
 in.
 Who


knows?
 But
 the
 point
 is
 when
 I
 travel
 to


other
 countries
 that
 never
 crosses
 my


mind.
 I
 mean
 I've
 been
 to
 a
 few
 places


where
 it's
 a
 little
 scary
 they've
 got


automatic
 weapons
 or
 we
 had
 to
 carry
 our


passports
 around.
 But
 just
 the


description
 now
 tells
 me
 that
 not
 only


do
 they
 not
 deserve
 our
 money
 if
 we
 can


keep
 it
 from
 them
 because
 of
 the
 way


they're
 bullying
 us
 and
 threatening
 our


sovereignty
 and
 our
 economy
 and
 a
 lot
 of


jobs
 in
 this
 country.
 But
 also
 it


doesn't
 feel
 like
 a
 place
 that
 I
 would


go
 unless
 I
 had
 to,
 you
 know,
 and
 so


people
 have
 to
 work,
 Stephen.
 people


have
 to
 close
 up
 maybe
 their
 their
 place


they
 have
 down
 there
 if
 they
 decide


they're
 not
 going
 back.
 People
 might


have
 a
 family
 emergency.
 That's
 for
 all


of
 us
 on
 our
 own
 conscience.
 And


sometimes
 I
 buy
 stuff
 on
 Amazon
 and
 I


go,
 "Oo,
 I
 shouldn't
 have
 done
 that."


Right?
 We're
 not
 perfect,
 but
 we
 have
 to


do
 everything
 we
 can
 to
 send
 a
 clear


signal.
 We
 want
 to
 be
 safe.
 We
 want
 to


make
 sure
 they
 get
 that
 we're
 not
 happy


and
 we
 won't
 be
 bullied.
 And
 again,


economic
 patriotism.
 Let's
 build
 up


Canada
 for
 the
 future.
 Let's
 control,
 as


our
 prime
 minister
 says,
 the
 things
 we


can.
 We
 can't
 control
 Trump's
 edicts
 or


a
 border
 guide,
 Stephen.
 But
 we
 can


control
 our
 choices
 with
 our
 money.


>> You
 mentioned
 money,
 and
 I
 want
 to
 do


what
 Woodward
 and
 Bernstein
 suggested,


which
 is
 follow
 the
 money.
 Before
 we


follow
 the
 money,
 I
 want
 to
 rerack
 here


for
 a
 second
 because
 I
 want
 to
 remind


everybody
 that
 we
 are
 here
 in
 New


Market,
 Ontario,
 and
 the
 mayor
 is
 here.


How
 about
 that?
 John
 Taylor
 decided
 just


to
 show
 up
 today.
 We're
 grateful
 for


that.
 [applause]


And
 we're
 in
 the
 Upper
 Canada
 Mall,


which
 I
 got
 to
 say
 is
 absolutely
 We're


here
 on
 a
 It's
 a
 Sunday
 afternoon.
 It
 is


booming
 here
 today.
 I
 thought
 I
 was
 at


Yorkdale
 for
 a
 second.
 It's
 so
 busy.


Anyways,
 uh
 we're
 talking
 about
 whether


or
 not
 Snowbird
 should
 go
 south
 this


winter
 or
 whether
 or
 not
 it
 would
 be


better
 to
 stay
 here.
 As
 if
 that
 were
 a


registry
 of
 our
 antipathy
 for
 what


Donald
 Trump
 is
 doing
 to
 Canada
 right


now.
 These
 are
 some
 of
 the
 issues
 we're


exploring.
 Peter
 Sherman
 is
 here.
 Laura


Babcock
 is
 here.
 And
 we're
 figuring
 this


out
 as
 we
 go.
 And
 as
 I
 say,
 we
 want
 to


follow
 the
 money.
 Now,
 here's
 some


numbers
 I
 want
 to
 put
 on
 the
 record.


This
 is
 according
 to
 the
 US
 Travel


Association.
 Canadian
 travelers
 inject


about
 $20
 billion
 into
 the
 United
 States


and
 a
 lot
 of
 that,
 of
 course,
 is
 from


snowbirds.


However,
 the
 US
 is
 a
 $30
 trillion


economy.
 And
 even
 in
 Florida,
 Canadians


only
 make
 up
 1.7
 million
 of
 75
 million


annual
 visitors.


So
 Peter,
 start
 with
 you
 and
 then
 I'll


get
 Laura
 to
 come
 in.
 If
 we
 do
 what


Laura
 suggests,


given
 these
 numbers,
 is
 anybody
 going
 to


notice
 down
 there?


>> Yeah.
 The
 guy
 who
 runs
 the
 deli
 down
 the


street
 from
 where
 I
 used
 to
 live
 in
 Boca


Raton
 because
 he
 services
 Canadians
 and


without
 Canadians,
 he
 winds
 up
 getting


hurt.
 But
 that's
 who
 gets
 hurt.
 the


overall
 economy
 of
 the
 United
 States


does
 not
 get
 hurt.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


what
 what
 Trump
 knows
 very
 well
 and


that's
 why
 he
 can
 play
 the
 bully
 that


he's
 playing.
 The
 the
 bottom
 line
 here


is
 Laura
 said
 it.
 This
 is
 not
 the
 United


States
 that
 we
 remember.
 It's
 not
 the


United
 States
 that
 when
 I
 was
 a
 little


kid
 had
 money
 that
 we
 could
 exchange
 at


a$110
 Canadian
 rather
 than
 60
 cents


Canadian.
 Um,
 it's
 not
 the
 place
 that
 my


parents
 took
 us
 for
 picnics
 on
 a


Saturday
 so
 that
 my
 mother
 could
 go


lingerie
 shopping
 or
 grocery
 shopping.


It's
 not
 the
 place
 that
 just
 a
 few
 years


ago
 when
 I
 lived
 in
 Niagara
 on
 the
 lake,


we
 could
 go
 into
 our
 grocery
 shopping


across
 in
 Buffalo
 and
 get
 products
 that


we
 couldn't
 get
 here.
 It's
 not
 that.


It's
 something
 different.
 The
 only


constant
 in
 the
 world
 is
 change.
 When
 it


comes
 to
 things,
 for
 example,
 like


biometrics,
 which
 you
 were
 just
 talking


about,
 biometrics
 are
 a
 fact
 of
 life.
 If


you
 go
 into
 Shenhen
 Europe,
 Shenhen


being
 the
 30
 countries
 or
 so
 of
 the
 EU,


when
 you
 enter
 one,
 you've
 entered
 them


all.
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 go
 into
 each
 one


with
 a
 passport.
 So
 you
 go
 and
 you
 you


land
 at
 Paris
 or
 you
 do
 what
 you
 have
 to


do,
 which
 includes
 a
 fingerprint,
 by
 the


way,
 and
 a
 photograph,
 which
 is
 what
 the


Americans
 are
 asking
 for.
 Probably


something
 that
 in
 the
 not
 too
 distant


future
 we
 will
 be
 asking
 for.
 And
 that


way
 they
 have
 it.
 The
 world
 changes
 all


the
 time.
 Why?
 because
 airplanes
 take


people
 anywhere
 they
 want
 to
 go
 and


deposit
 them
 there.
 And
 and
 we're


looking
 at
 a
 a
 crisis
 that
 was
 created


in
 the
 past
 that
 Trump
 thinks
 he's


solving
 in
 a
 way
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 don't


approve
 of,
 but
 he
 is
 attacking
 it


however
 we
 we
 view
 it.
 Uh
 and
 that's
 as


a
 result
 of
 people
 landing
 where
 they


shouldn't
 have
 been
 without
 having
 the


kind
 of
 interview
 we're
 talking
 about.


So
 I
 don't
 have
 any
 particular


objections
 to
 that.
 Speaking
 of
 which,


when
 I
 lived
 in
 Niagara
 on
 the
 lake,
 I


often
 encountered
 that
 guy
 who
 got
 up
 on


the
 wrong
 side
 of
 the
 bed.
 And
 this
 is


long
 before
 there
 was
 a
 Trump.
 And
 and


if
 you
 answered
 a
 question
 wrong,
 he'd


say,
 "I
 asked
 the
 questions
 here."


Whereas
 my
 most
 recent
 trip
 was
 through


Pearson.
 I
 presented
 my
 Nexus
 card
 to
 a


machine.
 When
 they
 called
 Sherman,
 we


walked
 through
 a
 a
 kiosk
 and
 the
 guy


said,
 "Mr.
 Mr.
 Sherman,
 have
 a
 nice


trip."
 So
 you
 it
 depends
 on
 who
 you


encounter.
 That's
 it.


>> I
 want
 to
 put
 those
 numbers
 to
 you


again,
 though,
 Laura.
 20
 billion


annually
 from
 us
 to
 them
 in
 a
 $30


trillion
 economy.
 Even
 if
 every
 single


person
 here
 boycotted,
 is
 it
 a
 pimple
 on


the
 back
 of
 an
 elephant?
 I
 never


mentioned
 the
 economic
 argument
 in
 my


top
 three.
 If
 you
 recall,
 I
 talked
 about


safety,
 signal,
 and
 solidarity.
 And


that's
 for
 a
 good
 reason
 because
 we
 are


a
 drop
 in
 their
 bucket,
 but
 they
 are
 an


entire
 waterfall
 to
 our
 economy,
 right?


So
 what
 signal
 do
 we
 send
 if
 we
 say
 you


know what
 even
 though
 it's
 only$20


billion
 dollar
 uh
 maybe
 that's
 $20


billion
 let's
 talk
 about
 the
 impact
 on


Canada's
 economy
 if
 you
 travel
 this


country
 if
 you
 check
 out
 places
 you've


never
 gotten
 to
 if
 you
 pump
 those


dollars
 back
 into
 Canadian
 stores.


Change
 up
 your
 purchasing
 habits.
 Find


local
 farms
 for
 your
 food.
 Stay
 away


from
 the
 big
 American
 discount
 stores.


Find
 Canadian
 ones.
 So
 the
 money
 when


it's
 on
 us
 is
 a
 big
 freaking
 deal
 in


this.
 But
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 something


that
 we
 haven't
 touched
 on
 enough
 in
 my


mind
 and
 I
 was
 honest
 off
 the
 top.
 I


said
 it's
 the
 one
 I'm
 most
 passionate


about.
 And
 that
 is
 they're
 not
 just


threatening
 our
 country
 with
 a
 trade


war.
 We've
 been
 through
 trade
 wars.
 We


understand
 that.
 We
 had
 a
 hard


renegotiation
 with
 Trump.1.


What
 this
 is
 is
 a
 constant
 threat
 to
 our


sovereignty.
 And
 it
 is
 not
 just
 Trump


trolling
 us.
 Trust
 me,
 I'm
 probably
 on


social
 media
 more
 than
 everyone
 here


today.
 I
 know
 a
 good
 troll
 when
 I
 see


one.
 That's
 not
 what
 this
 is.
 You
 know,


manifest
 destiny
 as
 a
 doctrine
 goes
 way


back.
 Talking
 about
 how
 Canada
 is
 a


natural
 part
 of
 the
 United
 States.
 The


Monroe
 Doctrine
 way
 back
 talks
 about
 how


the
 Western
 Hemisphere
 is
 the
 sphere
 of


influence
 of
 the
 United
 States.
 Right?


This
 is
 not
 a
 new
 concept.
 But
 what


Donald
 Trump
 is
 very
 good
 at
 is


normalizing
 the
 outrageous.
 saying
 it


over
 and
 over
 in
 a
 joking
 light-hearted


way
 until
 it
 becomes
 normalized
 with
 a


generation
 of
 Americans
 who
 see
 our


minerals
 and
 see
 our
 access
 to
 the


northern
 uh
 gateway
 which
 is
 hugely


valuable
 now
 uh
 as
 as
 being
 theirs.
 And


we
 have
 to
 stand
 up
 now
 for
 our


children.
 I
 got
 teenagers.
 They're
 here.


And
 for
 our
 grandchildren
 and
 say
 in


this
 moment
 when
 our
 sovereignty
 was


being
 threatened,
 we
 sure
 as
 hell


weren't
 going
 to
 make
 it
 easier
 for
 them


to
 take
 our
 country.


>> Okay,
 let
 me
 do
 Again
 [applause]


with
 applause
 again.


Peter
 mentioned
 he's
 got
 a
 connection


with
 Florida.


You're
 getting
 Were
 those
 the
 kids


applauding
 for
 you?
 I
 don't
 know.
 How


many
 people
 here
 have
 been
 to
 Florida?


Hands
 up.
 Okay,
 for
 those
 listening
 on


podcast,
 pretty
 much
 every
 hand
 in
 the


room
 went
 up.
 Canadians
 love
 going
 to


Florida.
 Whether
 it's
 for
 spring


training
 for
 the
 Blue
 Jays
 or
 whatever,


Canadians
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 there.
 I


got
 some
 more
 numbers
 I
 want
 to
 share.


This
 is
 how
 many
 people
 have
 been
 to


Orlando
 specifically?
 Hands
 up.
 Again,


probably
 80%
 of
 the
 hands
 went
 up
 here.


This
 is
 according
 to
 visit
 Orlando.
 This


is
 the
 tourism
 bureau
 for
 Central


Florida.
 By
 everybody
 going
 to
 Orlando


or
 Florida,
 you
 are
 reducing
 the
 local


tax
 burden
 by
 $7,474


per
 household
 in
 the
 Orlando
 region


alone.
 If
 you
 broaden
 it
 out
 to
 Orange


County,
 a
 bigger
 area,
 the
 tax
 burden
 is


reduced
 by
 more
 than
 $10,000
 per


household.
 The
 governor
 of
 Florida
 says,


quote,
 "I
 want
 Canadian
 tourists
 and


Brazilian
 tourists
 subsidizing
 the
 state


and
 making
 it
 so
 Florida
 residents
 pay


less
 taxes."
 He
 should
 have
 said
 fewer


taxes,
 but
 Mr.
 Dantis
 isn't
 great
 on
 the


grammar
 there,
 so
 that's
 okay.
 All


right.
 We
 we
 clearly
 Peter
 are
 you
 know


as
 you
 look
 at
 20
 billion
 in
 a
 30


trillion
 economy
 that's
 not
 all
 that


much.


>> I
 understand
 why
 the
 governor
 is
 saying


what
 he's
 saying.
 Having
 said
 that
 we're


assuming
 that
 we're
 all
 going
 to
 stop


going
 and
 when
 we
 all
 stop
 going
 those


numbers
 that
 you
 quoted
 will
 disappear


and
 the
 burden
 on
 those
 particular


cities
 will
 be
 extreme.


>> That's
 everybody
 incidentally


represents
 all
 tourists.
 No,
 we're
 not


all
 going
 to
 disappear.


>> That's
 right.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 it's


going
 to
 be
 as
 a
 result
 of
 people


deciding
 they're
 going
 to
 boycott
 Disney


World
 this
 year,
 which
 is
 Orlando,
 or


some
 of
 the
 other
 attractions
 that
 are


in
 that
 area.
 It's
 temporary.
 They're


going
 to
 have
 to
 suck
 it
 up
 the
 same
 way


our
 prime
 minister
 has
 told
 us.
 We're


going
 to
 have
 to
 make
 sacrifices.
 That's


just
 the
 way
 it
 is.
 And
 and
 it's
 the


nature
 of
 something
 that
 changes.
 We're


in
 change.
 Um
 Laura
 brought
 up
 the
 issue


of
 of
 Trump
 being
 uh
 a
 factor
 and
 of


course
 he
 is
 in
 this
 change
 and
 changing


things
 in
 a
 dramatic
 way.
 I
 think
 he


knows
 exactly
 what
 he's
 doing
 and
 I


think
 he
 knows
 exactly
 what
 he
 wants
 to


achieve.
 He
 talked
 for
 a
 while
 and


teased
 us
 about
 a
 51st
 state.
 They
 can't


do
 a
 51st
 state
 because
 their
 Congress


would
 never
 pass
 it.
 We
 can't
 do
 a
 51st


state
 because
 we'd
 have
 to
 open
 up
 the


1982
 Charter
 of
 Rights
 and
 Freedoms.
 So


there's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 a
 51st
 state.


What
 he
 wants
 is
 a
 North
 American


fortress.
 The
 same
 thing
 that
 Doug
 Ford


often
 talks
 about
 it
 and
 he's
 going
 to


get
 it
 in
 the
 end
 because
 we
 had
 it.
 We


and
 and
 basically
 Trump
 says
 this
 all


the
 time.
 We
 took
 it.
 We
 lived
 under
 the


defense
 umbrella.
 We
 didn't
 say
 thank


you.
 We
 just
 did.
 He
 doesn't
 want
 us
 to


take
 a
 free
 ride
 anymore.
 You
 can
 like


that
 or
 not
 like
 it,
 but
 it's
 a
 fact.
 So


the
 change
 that
 he
 wants
 to
 evoke
 in
 all


of
 this,
 he
 also
 wants
 a
 separate
 trade


agreement
 with
 Mexico
 from
 the
 one
 he


has
 with
 Canada.
 Why?
 Because
 the
 trade


components
 are
 different
 with
 each
 of


these
 countries.
 So
 he's
 pushing
 towards


that.
 I
 think
 he's
 going
 to
 get
 that,


too.
 And
 in
 the
 end,
 if
 we
 were
 to


project
 out
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 Trump's


presidency,
 don't
 all
 applaud
 um
 three


years,
 we
 would
 probably


>> might
 not
 be
 three
 years.
 So
 we'll
 see.


>> Three
 years
 and
 then
 and
 then
 we'll
 get


JD.
 Okay.
 But
 the
 the
 bottom
 line
 is


he's
 three
 years
 away
 from
 going
 away.
 I


think
 he's
 going
 to
 achieve
 a
 lot
 of


these
 things
 in
 3
 years.
 We
 might
 just


find
 that
 some
 of
 them
 were
 positive.


>> I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 just
 how
 far
 I
 mean


your
 view
 on
 this
 is
 crystal
 clear,
 but


I
 wonder
 and
 this
 is
 a
 program
 that


you're
 on
 today
 which
 sort
 of
 celebrates


being
 able
 to
 strongly
 disagree
 without


being
 disagreeable.


Would
 you
 put
 loyalty
 tests
 on
 this?
 As


in,
 if
 I
 found
 that
 a
 friend
 of
 mine
 was


going
 to
 the
 United
 States,
 I
 might
 stop


speaking
 to
 that
 friend.
 Would
 you
 do


that?


>> Never.
 Cuz
 we
 didn't
 pick
 this
 fight.


Why
 fight
 with
 each
 other
 about
 it,


right?
 [laughter]


I
 mean,
 h
 how
 does
 that
 help
 us
 to
 be


mad
 at
 each
 other
 for
 not
 passing
 some


purity
 test?
 I
 am
 against
 purity
 tests


in
 everything,
 Stephen.
 I
 think
 humans


are
 much
 more
 nuanced.
 It's
 more
 about


being
 strategic.
 I'm
 a
 strategist
 by


work.
 And
 what
 is
 the
 strategic
 thing
 to


do?
 uh
 it
 is
 to
 sacrifice
 where
 we
 can


to
 send
 a
 clear
 signal
 to
 this


government
 that
 even
 though
 my
 colleague


here
 thinks
 it's
 inevitable
 that
 Trump's


going
 to
 get
 some
 of
 his
 ends.
 I
 don't


believe
 in
 inevitability.
 I
 believe
 in


strategy.
 And
 when
 it's
 said
 that
 it


can't
 be
 a
 51st
 state,
 I
 say,
 well,


that's
 not
 if
 we
 use
 the
 norms.
 But
 to


your
 point,
 change
 happens.
 And
 we're


seeing
 change
 right
 now
 in
 the
 US
 and


how
 they're
 operating.
 Congress
 hasn't


really
 done
 much
 of
 its
 job
 and
 neither


has
 the
 third
 branch,
 the
 judiciary.
 Are


they
 going
 to
 prevent
 another
 Trump


presidency?
 Apparently,
 the
 plan
 is
 in


place
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to
 keep
 him
 there.


So,
 I
 love
 the
 idea
 of
 everything


flipping
 in
 the
 midterms.
 I
 love
 the


idea
 of
 Trump
 leaving
 after
 two
 terms,


as
 one
 should
 in
 the
 US.
 I
 love
 the
 idea


of
 this
 all
 being
 a
 big
 joke.
 But
 until


I
 am
 seeing
 evidence
 that
 it
 is
 in
 fact


a
 joke,
 I
 am
 not
 going
 to
 sit
 here
 and


be
 blasze.
 I'm
 going
 to
 fight
 for
 my


country
 every
 damn
 day.


>> Want
 to
 see
 [applause]


I
 want
 to
 dig
 down
 just
 a
 little
 deeper


and
 see
 if
 there
 is
 some
 more
 nuance
 in


this
 audience.
 Most
 of
 you,
 the
 vast


majority
 of
 you
 when
 I
 asked
 the


question
 off
 the
 top,
 would
 you
 go
 to


the
 United
 States
 right
 now
 all
 said
 no?


Let
 me
 refine
 the
 question
 a
 little
 bit


more.
 What
 about
 California?
 What
 about


New
 York?
 What
 about
 Massachusetts?


These
 are
 blue
 states.
 These
 are
 not


states
 that
 voted
 for
 Trump.
 Would
 that


make
 you
 change
 your
 mind?
 How
 many


people
 here


would
 think,


I
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 to
 Florida.
 I
 don't


want
 to
 go
 to
 Arizona.
 I
 don't
 want
 to


go
 to
 the
 Midwest.
 I
 won't
 go
 to
 the


deep
 south.
 But
 the
 blue
 states,
 that's


okay.
 Hands
 up.


One,
 two,
 three,
 four,
 five,
 six,
 seven.


Okay.
 Very
 few.
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 pretty


hardline
 audience,
 right?
 I'm
 seeing


heads
 nodding.
 This
 is
 a
 pretty
 hardline


audience.
 What
 about
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 One
 and


two.


>> When
 Gavin
 Newsome,
 who
 I
 deeply
 admire,


how
 he
 has
 stepped
 up.
 Exactly.


Canadians
 are
 cheering
 for
 the


California
 governor
 here.
 Um
 when
 he
 put


out
 a
 video
 saying,
 "Come
 on,
 Canada.


We're
 California.
 You
 love
 us.
 We
 love


you."
 Right.
 Uh
 I
 said,
 you
 know,
 with


all
 due
 respect,
 and
 I
 love
 California,


been
 there
 many
 times.
 This
 is
 not
 the


message,
 Gavin.
 you
 know,
 we
 support


your
 state,
 but
 we
 need
 to
 be
 in


solidarity
 against
 the
 unfair
 trade


practices
 coming
 from
 that
 Trump


government.
 It
 is
 not
 about
 that.
 And
 I


have
 to
 say,
 Stephen,
 in
 anticipation


that
 maybe
 things
 would
 go
 this
 way,
 I


didn't
 anticipate,
 honestly,
 some
 of
 the


violence
 we're
 seeing
 with
 the
 ICE
 raids


and
 stuff,
 I
 couldn't
 imagine
 that.
 Um,


but
 I
 my
 daughter,
 I
 was
 going
 to
 take


her
 to
 New
 York
 City,
 my
 favorite
 place


on
 earth,
 maybe
 uh
 for
 her
 16th


birthday.
 I
 took
 her
 at
 14
 the
 month


before
 the
 election
 just
 in
 case
 I


wasn't
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 take
 her
 for


a
 few
 years.
 And
 I
 didn't
 want
 her
 to


miss
 America
 at
 its
 best.
 When
 you
 stand


in
 in
 Time
 Square
 on
 a
 beautiful
 night


on
 a
 Saturday
 night
 and
 you
 feel
 the


energy
 of
 the
 world,
 the
 diversity,
 I


wanted
 her
 to
 experience
 the
 best
 of


America.


>> Let
 me
 understand
 this.
 When
 did
 she


turn
 16?


>> In
 in
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half.
 I
 took
 her


early.
 I
 took
 her
 at
 14
 right
 before
 the


election
 because
 I
 said
 just
 in
 case
 I


don't
 want
 you
 to
 miss
 America
 when
 it


is
 still
 a
 shining
 city
 on
 a
 hill
 at
 its


zenith
 and
 it
 breaks
 my
 heart
 but
 I'm
 so


glad
 I
 did.


>> You
 know
 who
 called
 it
 a
 shining
 city
 on


a
 hill?


>> Reagan.
 Yes.
 Republican
 president.
 Yes.


He
 doesn't
 like
 tariffs
 by
 the
 way
 in


case
 anyone's
 unclear
 on
 the
 history


record.


>> I
 think
 the
 Ontario
 government
 just


spent
 75
 million
 bucks
 reminding
 us
 that


Ronald
 Reagan
 didn't
 like
 tariffs


>> a
 little
 bit
 and
 then
 we
 heard
 it
 was


just
 AI
 and
 it
 was
 all
 fake.
 It
 wasn't.


He
 never
 did
 for
 the
 reasons
 that
 we're


seeing
 and
 for
 the
 person
 in
 Boca
 Ratan


whose
 store
 is
 suffering,
 right?
 Tariffs


are
 not
 good
 in
 the
 long
 term
 for


American
 businesses.


>> Peter,
 I
 just
 wanted
 to
 ask
 the
 audience


a
 question
 as
 you
 have.
 If
 I
 said
 that


Steve
 had
 in
 his
 lefthand
 pocket
 a
 pair


of
 tickets
 to
 one
 of
 the
 games
 in
 Los


Angeles
 in
 the
 next
 couple
 of
 days,
 and


he
 also
 had
 an
 airplane
 ticket
 in
 a


hotel
 room,
 and
 one
 of
 you
 was
 going
 to


get
 it.
 How
 many
 would
 accept
 it
 if
 it


was
 awarded
 to
 you?
 [laughter]


>> We
 should
 just
 explain,
 Peter,
 th
 this


will
 be
 air.


>> He
 doesn't,
 by
 the
 way.


>> No,
 I
 don't.
 This
 will
 air
 in
 November,


but
 we
 are
 sitting
 here
 recording
 this


the
 night
 after
 the
 Blue
 Jays
 lost
 game


two
 to
 the
 LA
 Dodgers
 in
 the
 World


Series.
 And
 some
 people
 have
 got
 their


Blue
 Jay
 paraphernalia
 on
 here
 today.


But
 yeah,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 discussion
 I


think
 in
 the
 country
 right
 now
 among


some


who
 know
 that
 it
 actually
 might
 be


cheaper
 to
 to
 scalp
 some
 tickets
 for


Toronto
 and
 go
 to
 Los
 Angeles
 and
 see


them
 play
 there
 because
 of
 course
 the


Dodgers
 are
 in
 it
 all
 the
 time
 and
 it's


not
 the
 hot
 ticket
 there.
 It
 is
 here.
 So


this
 is
 a
 real
 what
 you've
 just
 raised.


No,
 I
 don't
 have
 any
 tickets
 in
 my


pocket,
 but
 it's
 a
 real
 thing.


>> But
 these
 are
 the
 kinds
 of
 things
 that


we
 ask
 ourselves,
 you
 know,
 what
 what
 is


it
 that
 I'm
 prepared
 to
 break
 my
 word


for?
 Um,
 I'm
 I'm
 as
 strong
 for
 Canada
 as


as
 my
 colleague
 is,
 but
 I
 I'm
 not
 going


to
 jump
 up
 and
 down
 and
 rave
 about
 it.


I've
 served
 in
 the
 Ontario
 legislature


and
 raved
 about
 it
 for
 plenty
 of
 years,


and
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 telling
 you
 what
 a


great
 guy
 I
 am.
 I'm
 simply
 saying


there's
 a
 reality.
 The
 reality
 is
 I


might
 want
 to
 see
 one
 of
 those
 games
 in


Los
 Angeles.
 The
 reality
 is
 that
 when


they
 ran
 the
 season
 opener,
 and
 I
 know


this
 is
 airing
 on
 November
 the
 22nd,


when
 they
 ran
 the
 season
 opener,
 um,
 in


late
 October,
 they
 brought
 a
 an


incredible
 choir
 called
 The
 Voices
 of


Fire
 and
 put
 together
 a
 a
 show
 by
 Farel


Williams
 for
 those
 who
 don't
 know
 it,


>> one
 of
 the
 World
 Series.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 watched
 the
 I
 watched
 the


most
 amazing
 renditions
 of
 both
 national


anthems
 ever,
 and
 I
 didn't
 hear
 one


blue.
 That's
 the
 way
 Americans
 and


Canadians
 have
 always
 been.
 It's
 the
 way


they
 are
 and
 it's
 the
 way
 they
 all


should
 be.
 And
 I
 I
 dare
 say
 will
 be
 one


day
 again.


>> May
 I
 just
 respond?


>> Um
 I'm
 sure
 you
 weren't
 referencing
 me


about
 jumping
 up
 and
 down
 and
 raving


because
 I
 have
 not
 been
 doing
 that
 today


or
 ever.
 I
 do
 think
 though
 that
 we
 have


to
 have
 some
 clarity
 about
 what
 it
 is


that
 we
 are
 sacrificing.
 Would
 I
 love
 to


go
 to
 a
 Jay's
 game
 in
 LA?
 100%.
 Would
 I


love
 to
 go
 to
 Nashville
 and
 party?
 If


you
 haven't,
 it
 is
 so
 much
 fun
 and
 I


desperately
 missed
 it.


>> You
 did
 say
 you
 were
 going
 to
 promise
 us


a
 Nashville
 story.
 What
 was
 that
 about?


>> You
 know,
 this
 is
 actually
 several
 years


ago
 when
 Biden
 was
 still
 in
 office,


maybe
 the
 third
 year
 of
 Biden's
 term
 and


we
 had
 just
 arrived
 in
 Nashville.
 We


were
 at
 this
 wonderful
 bar
 and
 we
 were


chatting
 up
 with
 one
 of
 the
 servers
 who


was
 actually
 from
 New
 York
 in
 Nashville


and
 we
 got
 talking
 about
 the
 Biden


administration
 and
 Trump,
 you
 know,
 I'm


a
 political
 pundit.
 It's
 what
 I
 do.
 Uh,


and
 after
 a
 few
 minutes
 the
 manager
 came


over
 and
 said,
 "You
 can't
 talk
 about


that
 here."
 And
 we're
 like,
 "What?"
 And


they
 said,
 "Well,
 this
 is,
 I
 believe
 at


the
 time
 it
 was
 open
 carry,
 but


Nashville
 is,
 you
 know,
 fairly


democratic
 city,
 but
 around."
 They
 said,


"There
 are
 people
 here
 in
 this
 bar
 who


are
 getting
 agitated
 just
 listening
 to


Canadians
 talk
 about
 Biden."
 And
 we


weren't
 even
 being
 particularly


provocative.
 It
 was
 breakfast,
 right?


Um,
 but
 I
 said
 to
 the
 manager,
 I
 said,


"What
 happened
 to
 America
 being
 the


bastion
 of
 free
 speech?"
 I
 mean
 that
 has


been
 the
 calling
 card
 of
 this
 country


since
 the
 get
 and
 we're
 sitting
 here
 and


we
 can't
 even
 have
 a
 polite
 breakfast


conversation
 with
 the
 hospitality


because
 it's
 too
 dangerous.
 And
 it
 was


at
 that
 moment
 where
 I
 was
 like
 wow.
 So


this
 change
 we're
 talking
 about
 is
 not


just
 about
 biometrics
 and
 technology.


It's
 a
 chilling
 in
 that
 country
 of
 the


very
 things
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 take
 for


granted
 in
 Canada.
 And
 until
 such
 time


that
 America
 gets
 back
 to
 a
 place
 where


you
 can
 have
 a
 conversation
 about
 the


president
 without
 feeling
 intimidated,
 I


won't
 be
 going.
 Whether
 it's
 a
 World


Series
 ticket
 or
 the
 best
 concert
 in
 the


world,
 it
 would
 have
 to
 take
 something


severely
 urgent
 and
 personal
 to
 my


family
 for
 me
 to
 step
 over
 that
 border.


Peter,


>> you're
 going
 to
 have
 I
 understand
 that


and
 I've
 experienced
 the
 same
 kind
 of


thing
 as
 you.
 So,
 we
 have
 no
 quarrel
 on


it.
 However,
 that's
 been
 going
 on
 for
 a


very
 long
 time
 and
 it
 goes
 on
 even
 here.


We
 have
 a
 good
 friend
 located
 in
 Niagara


on
 the
 lake
 where
 where,
 as
 I
 mentioned,


we
 used
 to
 live.
 Um,
 we
 were
 there


recently
 and
 she
 told
 us
 her
 neighbor
 no


longer
 talks
 to
 her.


>> She's
 an
 American
 by
 birth,
 has
 Canadian


citizen
 citizenship
 here
 by
 marriage.


So,
 she
 gets
 a
 vote
 in
 the
 States.
 and


she
 mentioned
 that
 she
 voted
 for
 Trump


to
 her
 neighbor
 who
 had
 been
 her
 great


bosom
 buddy
 gone,
 not
 in
 her
 life


anymore.
 It
 divides
 people.
 It
 divides


people
 at
 Thanksgiving
 tables.
 It


divides
 people
 at
 Christmas.
 It
 divides


people
 at
 all
 kinds
 of
 times
 when
 we


should
 be
 together.
 And
 that's
 a
 very


unfortunate
 thing.
 And
 it's
 equally


unfortunate
 that
 you
 experienced
 what


you
 experienced
 in
 Nashville.
 But
 I
 I


can
 tell
 you,
 having
 been
 in
 Florida


before
 any
 of
 this
 nonsense,
 um
 we
 got


into
 discussions
 with
 Americans,
 most


Americans,
 regular
 everyday
 Americans,


don't
 know
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 lot
 about
 Canada,


but
 they
 sure
 were
 taking
 notice
 then


because
 what
 was
 happening,
 a
 thing


called
 the
 convoy
 in
 Ottawa,
 and
 that


news
 made
 the
 states.
 Now
 Canada
 makes


the
 states
 every
 day
 because
 we're
 a


victim
 every
 day.
 Yesterday
 it
 was
 an


additional
 10%.
 Don't
 know
 what
 it'll
 be


tomorrow.


I
 have
 a
 question
 or
 a
 comment.
 What's


your
 name,
 ma'am?


>> Diane.


>> Hi,
 Diane.
 What
 did
 you
 want
 to
 say?


>> Thi
 this
 topic
 is
 huge
 and
 the
 comments


are
 excellent
 and
 I'm
 in
 a
 real


conundrum.
 Will
 you
 pinch
 me?
 Am
 I


really
 talking
 to
 Steve
 Pacin
 from
 TBO?


[laughter]


>> It's
 it's
 a
 very
 disappointing


experience,
 isn't
 it?


But
 if
 I
 may
 take
 it
 on
 on
 a
 personal


level
 just
 for
 a
 second
 driving
 here,
 I


received
 an
 email
 from
 my
 nephew
 that
 my


brother,
 a
 doctor,
 just
 retired,
 and
 his


wife
 yesterday
 were
 moved
 into
 a


senior's
 place.
 Unexpectedly
 had
 to


happen


on
 a
 personal
 level.
 We've
 been
 going
 to


Fort
 Meyers
 for
 10
 years.
 We
 might
 never


get
 another
 chance.


Can
 that
 come
 into
 play?
 I
 I
 support
 you


both.


>> I
 think
 it
 has
 to.


>> But
 it's
 our
 life
 and
 we
 don't
 know.
 And


>> that's
 and
 I've
 said
 that,
 right?
 It's


it's
 a
 personal
 decision
 and
 there
 are


some
 personal
 emergencies
 that


>> feel
 guilty.


>> Well,
 and
 that's
 a
 personal
 thing.
 I


don't
 think
 we
 should
 shame
 each
 other.


I
 don't
 think
 we
 should
 call
 out
 our


friends
 who
 have
 to
 make
 those
 choices


because
 what
 a
 devastating
 thing
 you're


concerned
 with,
 right?
 Um,
 so
 if
 as


Canadians
 we
 stay
 unified
 and
 as


Canadians
 we
 support
 other
 Canadians


choices,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 it
 could
 be
 the
 p


the
 tickets
 in
 your
 pocket
 for
 the
 Jay's


World
 Series
 game,
 maybe
 there's
 a
 child


of
 someone
 who
 is
 has
 a
 life-threatening


condition
 and
 seeing
 the
 Jays
 would
 be


everything
 for
 them
 and
 of
 course
 take


those
 tickets
 for
 that
 child.
 My
 point


is
 this
 is
 the
 bigger
 picture
 is
 not


about
 perfection.
 It's
 about
 saying,
 are


we
 doing
 our
 best?
 And
 as
 Canadians,


it's
 not
 just
 for
 those
 auto
 workers
 and


for
 those
 small
 businesses
 affected.


It's
 also
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 is


watching
 us.
 Do
 you
 know
 how
 many
 times


I
 get
 tweets
 from
 Greenland
 saying,


[laughter]
 "We're
 with
 you,
 Canada."
 And


we're
 like,
 "We're
 with
 you."
 Right.


>> Diane,
 thank
 you
 for
 those
 comments.


Yes,
 sir.
 What's
 your
 name?
 Uh,
 Peter.


Uh,
 thank
 you
 for
 your
 comments.
 Uh
 I


have
 traveled
 the
 world
 on
 business
 and


listened
 to
 many
 people
 and
 people
 are


all
 the
 same.
 It's
 the
 politicians
 that


usually
 screw
 things
 up.
 And
 I'll
 tell


you
 I'll
 tell
 you
 one
 thing.
 We
 should


stop
 the
 fearongering.


This
 will
 all
 wash
 out
 within
 a
 year.


>> Within
 a
 year.


>> Within
 a
 year.
 How
 can
 you
 be
 so
 sure?


It's
 just
 the
 way
 the
 politicians
 have


to
 work
 with
 the
 people.
 They
 have
 to.


>> You
 know,
 the
 next
 question
 I
 have
 is


that's
 a
 1992
 World
 Series
 champion.


That's
 the
 first
 year
 they
 won.
 You
 got


it
 autographed.
 Who's


>> Don
 White?


>> Well,
 that's
 Devon
 White.


>> Yes,
 it
 is.


>> Fantastic.


>> DVO
 started
 that
 triple
 play,
 didn't
 he?


He
 did
 start.
 That
 was
 a
 triple
 play.


>> All
 I
 remember
 is
 the
 one
 big
 one.


[laughter]


But
 I
 want
 to
 thank
 you
 for
 your


comments,
 for
 supporting
 our
 American


friends.
 And
 believe
 me,
 every
 American


that
 I
 meet,
 every
 time
 I
 go
 down
 there,


they
 love
 us.
 We
 attend
 a


It's
 a
 show
 that's
 put
 on
 by
 all
 the


residents
 of
 our
 place.
 And
 the
 first


thing
 that
 we
 do
 at
 the
 beginning
 of


that
 show
 is
 the
 national
 anthem
 of


America
 and
 Canada.
 And
 everybody
 sings


it


>> respectfully.
 Respectfully,


>> Steve,
 I
 like
 this
 guy.


>> Please.


>> I
 like
 this
 guy.
 He's
 wearing
 the
 right


shirt
 and
 he's
 saying
 the
 right
 things.


>> In
 all
 seriousness,
 sir,
 what
 it
 comes


down
 to
 is
 there's
 no
 argument
 here.


Laura
 and
 I
 met
 today
 for
 the
 first


time.
 We're
 aware
 of
 each
 other,
 but
 we


met
 for
 the
 first
 time.
 We
 we
 shook


hands.
 I
 would
 like
 to
 say
 we
 became
 new


friends.
 We
 listen
 to
 each
 other.
 I


don't
 disagree
 with
 anything
 she
 said.
 I


hope
 she
 doesn't
 disagree
 with
 anything


I've
 said.
 It's
 just
 a
 matter
 of


opinion.
 And
 the
 opinion
 that
 you've


just
 expressed
 kind
 of
 summarizes
 it.


We're
 going
 through
 a
 tough
 period.
 We


are.
 And
 nobody
 can
 argue
 with
 that.
 And


at
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 point
 where
 we


stop
 going
 through
 that
 tough
 period.


And
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 exactly
 what
 you


said,
 politicians
 talking
 to


politicians.
 God
 help
 us,
 but
 that's
 the


way
 it
 works.
 Uh
 that
 resolves
 this
 and


it
 will
 be
 it
 will
 be
 resolved.
 We
 have


a
 9,000
 kilometer
 border.
 What
 choice
 do


we
 have?
 We
 will
 resolve
 it.


>> We
 have
 the
 largest
 undefended
 border
 in


the
 world.
 Uh
 and
 uh
 so
 that's
 a


concern.
 But
 to
 your
 point,
 you
 if
 if


what
 you
 say
 is
 true,
 this
 will
 all
 be


fixed
 in
 a
 year.
 I
 will
 sleep
 better


tonight
 than
 I
 have
 in
 10
 months,
 sir.


Uh,
 and
 it
 could
 be
 my
 perspective
 is


based
 on
 the
 fact
 that
 as
 a
 living
 I


follow
 American
 politics
 very
 closely.


And
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 that
 if
 this
 was


politics
 as
 normal,
 I
 would
 be
 in


agreement
 with
 both
 of
 you.
 Let
 them


talk
 to
 each
 other.
 Work
 it
 out.
 This
 is


all
 just
 gamesmanship.
 That
 isn't
 what


it
 looks
 like
 and
 that
 isn't
 what
 we're


hearing
 from
 America.
 I
 hope
 it's


resolved.
 I
 hope
 conversation
 does
 it,


but
 that's
 not
 how
 it
 looks.
 So,
 I'm


going
 to
 hold
 what
 you
 said
 as
 a


positive,
 optimistic
 potential
 in
 my


back
 of
 my
 mind,
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 act
 in


every
 way
 I
 can
 to
 help
 my
 country
 get


through
 this
 as
 quickly
 and
 as
 safely
 as


humanly
 possible.
 But
 it
 is
 not
 just
 a


matter
 of
 opinion.
 I'm
 not
 up
 here
 just


opining
 because
 it's
 fun.
 I
 am
 up
 here


warning
 our
 country
 that
 we
 need
 to
 do


everything
 we
 can
 to
 protect
 our


sovereignty
 and
 our
 economy.
 And
 I
 will


not
 have
 it
 relativized.
 It's
 not


relative.
 It's
 serious
 for
 me.
 And
 I


want
 to
 make
 sure
 that's
 clear.


>> Okay.
 back
 here.
 Yes,
 ma'am.
 What's
 your


name?


>> Hi,
 I'm
 Moren.
 And
 Laura,
 you
 actually


stole
 my
 thunder,


>> but
 you're
 on
 the
 panel
 and
 I'm
 not.
 So,


thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Um,
 I'm
 not
 a


snowbird
 yet.
 Um,
 and
 hopefully
 one
 day


maybe
 I
 will
 be,
 whether
 it's
 to
 the
 US


or
 to
 somewhere
 else.
 I'm
 not
 at
 that


stage
 right
 now.
 But
 I
 wanted
 to
 come


here
 because
 I
 know
 what
 my
 opinions


are.
 I
 know
 where
 my
 beliefs,
 my
 values


are,
 but
 I
 wanted
 to
 hear
 the
 other


perspective.
 And
 I
 think
 we're
 aligned.


I
 might
 not
 be
 where
 you
 are
 right
 now,


but
 I


>> my
 age.


>> No,
 no,
 no.
 I
 mean,
 on
 this,
 you
 said


you're
 not
 quite
 where
 Laura
 is.


>> I'm
 at
 the
 snowbird
 level.
 I
 haven't
 I'm


I'm
 still,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 still
 actively


engaged.


>> But
 you
 think
 people
 should
 go
 down?


>> Um,
 not
 right
 now.


>> So,
 you're
 with
 Laura
 in
 that
 respect.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 I
 am
 with
 uh
 80
 plus%


of
 this
 audience
 as
 well.
 But
 I
 think


there's
 nuances
 and
 I
 think
 there
 are


people
 here
 that,
 you
 know,
 might
 not
 be


in
 the
 situation
 that
 I'm
 at
 and
 might


say,
 you
 know
 what,
 I
 might
 not
 get
 down


there
 ever
 again.
 This
 may
 be
 my
 only


chance.
 That's
 why
 I'm
 not
 there
 yet.


But
 what
 I
 where
 I
 am
 is
 I
 am
 not


willfully
 ignorant
 or
 blissfully


ignorant,
 whatever.
 I'm
 not
 putting
 my


head
 in
 the
 sand.
 So
 if
 today
 we
 think


that
 this
 is
 not
 normal,
 this
 is
 not


normalized.
 Although
 the
 US
 regime
 is


trying
 to
 normalize
 it
 for
 us,
 this
 is


not
 normal.
 So
 while
 we're
 here,
 I'm


going
 to
 make
 some
 decisions
 right
 now


to
 protect
 myself,
 protect
 my
 own


country.
 And
 there
 may
 be
 hardships,


there
 may
 be
 sacrifices,
 but
 I'm
 willing


to
 make
 them.
 If
 I
 was
 a
 little
 bit


older
 than
 what
 I
 am
 right
 now,
 I
 would


have
 a
 different
 perspective.
 And
 I


would
 say
 absolutely.
 You
 know,
 you
 may


not
 have
 the
 same
 opportunities
 that
 I


might
 have
 in
 the
 next
 20,
 30
 years,
 but


right
 now,
 this
 is
 where
 we're
 at.
 Now,


hopefully
 a
 year
 from
 now,
 it
 will
 pass.


I'm
 not
 feeling
 that
 right
 now.
 I
 love


the
 optimism
 of
 these
 people
 because
 I'm


a
 little
 bit
 more
 pragmatic
 and
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 live
 in
 the
 world
 right
 now.


Until
 that
 changes,


I
 have
 to
 do
 what
 I
 need
 to
 do
 to


protect
 myself
 and
 to
 protect
 my


country.
 Moren,
 thanks
 for
 those


comments.
 Much
 appreciated.
 We're
 glad


you
 came
 today.


>> Your
 thunder.
 That
 was
 great.


>> Yes,
 sir.
 Please
 stand
 if
 you
 would.


>> Hi,
 Dave.
 Good
 to
 meet
 you.


>> Hi,
 Dave.


>> Um,
 I'm
 a
 little
 bit
 uncomfortable.
 No,


I'm
 getting
 greatly
 uncomfortable
 with


some
 of
 the
 minimization
 minimizing
 the


impact
 of
 what
 the
 American
 threat


actually
 is
 and
 and
 saying,
 well,
 we're


going
 to
 get
 along
 well
 with
 the


American
 people,
 and
 that's
 going
 to


heal
 it
 all
 over.
 I
 don't
 think
 the


situation
 now,
 the
 attitude
 from
 the


United
 States
 is
 any
 different
 than
 it


always
 has
 been.
 As
 William
 McKenzie,


>> you
 don't
 think
 the
 situation
 now
 is
 any


different
 than
 it's
 always
 been?


>> No.
 This
 has
 been
 the
 goal
 all
 along
 is


to
 assimilate.
 William
 L
 McKenzie
 King


after
 the
 Alta
 conference
 warned


Canadians
 that
 our
 biggest
 threat
 is


still
 from
 the
 United
 States
 who've


never
 given
 up
 on
 their
 goal
 of


assimilating
 Canada.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


been
 the
 perpetual
 thrust.
 Perhaps
 the


current
 presidency
 there
 has
 given
 more


license
 to
 people
 to
 be
 able
 to
 express


it
 and
 act
 on
 it.
 And
 certainly
 the


policies,
 the
 economic
 policies,
 the


trade
 policies
 are
 pushing
 that.
 As


Trump
 himself
 has
 said,
 he
 wants
 to


conquer
 Canada
 economically.


>> So
 do
 you
 go
 down
 to
 the
 States
 normally


in
 the
 winter?


>> No.


>> And
 you're
 not
 going
 this
 year,
 are
 you?


>> No,
 for
 sure
 not
 this
 winter.
 We've
 gone


down
 occasionally
 to
 visit
 friends,
 to


see
 family,
 had
 friends
 in
 Orlando
 or


family
 in
 Orlando.
 We
 used
 to
 visit.


We're
 not
 doing
 that
 anymore.


>> Not
 this
 time.


>> We
 can't.
 And
 that's
 the
 uh


the
 concept
 that
 uh
 Americans
 are
 really


good
 to
 get
 along
 with.
 Well,
 we
 still


know
 over
 half
 the
 people
 there
 support


these
 current
 policies.
 And
 when
 we
 say


where
 we're
 not
 feeling
 any
 of
 the


threat,
 any
 of
 the
 violence,
 any
 of
 the


repercussions
 of
 ICE,
 I
 notice
 all
 of
 us


saying
 that
 are
 white.
 You
 know,
 Dave,


thank
 you
 for
 that
 contribution.
 Okay,


we
 are
 in
 the
 home
 stretch
 here.
 Let
 me


just
 see
 here.
 Um,
 couple
 of
 things


before
 we
 finish.
 Okay,
 this
 is
 a
 you're


on
 a
 show
 here
 called
 TVO
 Today
 Live
 and


we
 do
 this
 basically
 once
 a
 month
 during


the
 course
 of
 the
 year.
 And
 essentially


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 it's
 a
 show
 about


democratic
 engagement,
 which
 you're
 all


doing
 by
 being
 here
 today.
 So
 I
 want
 to


want
 to
 just
 ask
 a
 few
 questions
 as
 we


wrap
 things
 up
 to
 see
 I
 want
 to
 see
 how


many
 people
 here
 have
 changed
 their


minds.
 Can
 I
 see
 the
 people
 who
 were


undecided
 at
 the
 beginning?
 Put
 your


hands
 up.
 Those
 of
 you
 who
 are
 undecided


at
 the
 beginning,
 there
 were
 a
 very
 few


of
 you.
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 nine.
 Yeah,
 very


few.
 How
 many
 of
 you
 having
 heard
 this


discussion
 are
 now
 with
 Peter
 Sherman


and
 you
 agree
 with
 his
 side
 of
 the


debate?
 Hands
 up
 please.


One,
 two,
 three,
 four,
 five.
 Okay.
 Six,


seven.
 All
 right.
 How
 many
 of
 you


undecideds
 are
 now
 with
 Laura
 Babcock?


One,
 two,
 three,
 four,
 five.
 Six.
 Wow.


You
 guys
 both
 sort
 of
 persuaded
 almost


equally
 the
 undecideds
 here
 today.


>> We
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 sway.


>> Yeah,
 very
 little.


>> Not
 bad.
 Not
 bad.
 Do
 you
 believe
 this


moment?
 How
 many
 people
 believe
 this


issue
 and
 this
 moment
 is
 adding
 to
 the


polarization
 between
 our
 two
 countries?


Hands
 up.


Hands
 down.
 How
 many
 people
 say
 kind
 of


what
 Dave
 said,
 it's
 always
 been
 this


bad
 and
 this
 is
 no
 worse
 than
 ever?


One.
 Okay,
 that's
 gone
 overwhelmingly


one
 way.
 All right.
 Um
 All right.
 Where


are
 we
 going
 to
 finish
 here?
 Let's
 do


one
 last


one
 a
 final
 show
 of
 hands
 here.


Should
 snowbirds
 skip
 going
 to
 the


United
 States
 this
 year?
 You've
 heard
 an


hour
 of
 debate.
 Who
 says
 yes,
 they


should
 skip?
 Hands
 up.


Hands
 down.
 Who
 says
 no,
 it's
 okay
 to


go?
 Hands
 up.


Hands
 down.
 What's
 your
 sense
 about
 how


the
 room
 has
 moved
 in
 the
 last
 hour?


Anybody
 got
 a
 view
 on
 that?


>> I
 don't
 think
 it's
 moved
 that
 much.
 I
 I


think
 generally
 speaking
 when
 you
 asked


the
 question
 at
 the
 outset
 it
 looked


about
 like
 that
 and
 it
 frankly
 was
 the


way
 I
 expected
 it
 to
 be.
 Look
 if
 we
 read


the
 popular
 press
 and
 we
 take
 the


statistics
 that
 we're
 seeing
 80%
 of


Canadians
 detest
 Trump
 and
 and
 are


avoiding
 the
 United
 States
 because
 of


it.
 So
 if
 I
 look
 at
 an
 audience
 like


this
 I
 should
 see
 that
 reflected
 and
 I


do.
 And
 you
 know what?
 I
 I
 I
 agree
 it


was
 going
 to
 be
 the
 way
 it
 is
 when


people
 walked
 in
 because
 we
 have
 strong


feelings
 about
 this,
 right?
 We
 have


informed
 opinions
 about
 this.
 We
 have


experienced
 it.
 We've
 seen
 the
 job


losses
 in
 the
 auto
 sector.
 We've
 seen


the
 headlines.
 We've
 felt
 the
 pain
 for


10
 months.
 Has
 it
 not
 been
 difficult
 to


be
 a
 Canadian
 for
 feeling
 for
 the
 first


time
 that
 our
 sovereignty
 is
 under


threat?
 It's
 been
 200
 years,
 right?
 the


Revolutionary
 War,
 the
 War
 of
 1812,
 the


last
 time
 that
 this
 manifest
 destiny
 has


been
 put
 to
 action.
 There
 have
 been
 some


little
 things
 in
 between,
 but
 nothing
 as


overt
 as
 right
 now.
 And
 it's
 coming


directly
 from
 the
 most
 powerful
 office


in
 the
 world.
 It
 has
 been
 stressful.
 So,


I
 think
 everyone
 coming
 in
 here,
 Steve,


was
 feeling
 a
 certain
 level
 of


commitment
 to
 the
 issue.
 What
 I
 think's


important
 though
 is
 going
 forward,
 not


everybody
 is
 as
 engaged
 on
 a
 beautiful


Sunday
 afternoon
 as
 you
 are
 with
 their


democracy.
 And
 if
 there's
 one
 thing
 that


I
 can
 try
 to
 leave
 this
 audience
 with
 is


that
 you
 need
 to
 talk
 about
 it.
 Silence


doesn't
 make
 us
 safer
 as
 a
 country.
 You


need
 to
 talk
 to
 your
 American
 friends.


You
 need
 to
 talk
 to
 your
 friends
 who


don't
 follow
 politics.
 You
 need
 to
 say


to
 them,
 "Are
 you
 aware
 of
 what's


happening
 and
 the
 consequences
 to
 our


economy?
 Are
 you
 aware
 of
 your
 choices


and
 how
 that
 might
 be
 sending
 a
 mixed


signal
 to
 an
 administration
 that
 pays


very
 close
 attention
 to
 signal
 and
 to


media?
 Are
 you
 aware?
 And
 if
 you're
 not,


I'd
 be
 happy
 to
 tell
 you
 how
 I
 feel


about
 it,
 hear
 how
 you
 feel
 about
 it,


and
 have
 a
 very
 honest,
 open,
 and
 loving


relationship
 because
 we're
 Canadians.


That's
 what
 we
 do.
 So,
 please
 do
 that.


Fight
 for
 democracy
 itself
 by
 talking
 to


each
 other.
 Thank
 you.
 And
 that
 is
 our


time.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 some
 thank


yous
 just
 before
 we
 pull
 the
 plug
 here


today.
 First
 of
 all,
 first
 and
 foremost,


Tina,
 can
 I
 turn
 my
 back
 on
 your
 camera


for
 a
 second
 here?
 I
 do
 want
 to
 thank


all
 of
 you
 for
 coming
 in
 on
 a
 Sunday


afternoon
 to
 participate
 in
 this


program.
 There
 are
 a
 million
 other


things
 you
 could
 be
 doing
 today.
 The


fact
 that
 you're
 here
 really
 give


yourselves
 a
 pat
 on
 the
 back
 for
 civic


engagement
 and
 being
 prepared
 to
 discuss


a
 controversial
 issue
 on
 television
 no


less.
 So
 kudos
 to
 you.
 Give
 yourselves
 a


hand.
 There
 we
 go.
