[Music]


hi
 everybody
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangin
 the
 CEO


of
 the
 Norwegian
 some
 wellth
 fund
 and


today
 we
 have
 a
 very
 very
 special
 guest


L
 strore
 is
 a
 dean
 of
 Stockholm
 School


of
 Economics
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 finest


Business
 Schools
 in
 Europe
 and
 Lars
 you


have
 revolutionized
 the
 Stockholm
 School


of
 economics
 and
 we
 are
 going
 to
 talk


about
 that
 today
 so
 warm
 welcome
 thanks


so
 much
 great
 to
 be
 here
 now
 um
 one
 of


the
 big
 things
 you
 have
 done
 is
 really


to
 introduce
 culture
 and
 learning
 about


culture
 into
 the
 school
 why
 is
 culture


important
 in
 business
 education
 because


it's
 uh
 when
 we
 say
 culture
 we
 mean
 uh


Arts
 we
 mean
 literature
 uh
 and
 also


music
 but
 basically
 the
 idea
 behind
 that


is
 uh
 to
 open
 up
 your
 senses
 to


contextualize
 to
 make
 you
 see
 the
 world


from
 New


Perspectives
 uh
 and
 it's
 actually
 you


know
 many
 business
 school
 students
 um


believe
 that
 they
 know
 how
 the
 world


functions
 and
 how
 it
 operates
 and
 you


think
 they
 don't
 well
 I
 think
 they're


there
 to
 learn
 right
 yeah
 so
 uh
 I
 think


it's
 a
 good
 idea
 to
 expose
 them
 to


things
 that
 they
 don't
 really
 understand


uh
 where
 they
 start
 asking
 themselves


questions
 where
 you
 actually
 sort
 of


widen
 the
 blinders
 that
 we
 all
 have
 not


just
 students
 and
 art
 can
 actually
 serve


uh
 as
 a
 sort
 of
 intellectual
 and


emotional
 itching
 powder
 to
 make
 you


understand
 the
 world
 in
 another
 way
 and


and
 also
 um
 increase
 your
 your


humbleness
 you
 become
 more
 humble
 if
 you


see
 things
 that
 you
 don't
 understand
 and


learn
 to
 live
 with
 it
 what
 are
 you


seeing
 in
 people
 after
 they
 have
 been


through
 this
 treatment
 it
 like
 well


after
 the
 treatments
 uh
 I
 think
 they
 um


um
 they
 get
 a
 sort
 of
 Fuller


understanding
 uh
 of
 the
 world
 not
 always


uh
 of
 course
 not
 I
 mean
 you
 can
 still
 go


through
 our
 education
 program
 uh
 just


knowing
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 figures
 and
 the


statistics
 and
 what
 happens
 only
 when


the
 uh
 sort
 of
 uh
 demand
 and
 Supply


curves
 meet
 but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 they
 are


more
 open
 to
 the
 world
 and
 I
 also
 think


uh
 this
 idea
 of
 being
 humble
 is
 really


really
 key
 in
 the
 world
 that
 we're


living
 in
 now
 why
 does
 culture
 lead
 to


humbleness
 because
 it
 sort
 of
 uh
 makes


you


um
 realize
 that
 you
 don't
 understand


everything
 if
 you
 have
 that
 type
 of


cultural
 expressions
 uh
 it
 is
 what
 they


what
 it
 can
 do
 it
 can
 also
 increase
 your


empathy
 so
 for
 instance
 if
 you
 if
 you


watch
 a
 TV
 show
 like
 Mad
 Men
 then
 you


know
 what
 it's
 like
 to
 live
 in
 Manhattan


in
 the
 1960s
 working
 in
 Ad
 Agency


business
 and
 being
 treated
 badly
 if


you're
 a
 woman
 and
 being
 treated
 badly


if
 you're
 a
 woman
 uh
 even
 though
 you


yourself
 have
 never
 been
 in
 that


position
 or
 that


situation
 uh
 and
 that's
 sort
 of
 one
 of


the
 greatnesses
 of
 of
 high
 quality


culture
 that
 can
 move
 you
 to
 other
 times


to
 other
 spaces
 and
 to
 other
 sets
 of


Minds
 so
 uh
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 read
 Romeo
 and


Juliet
 you
 know
 what
 it's
 like
 to
 be
 in


love
 with
 the
 wrong
 person
 even
 though


you
 yourself
 have
 perhaps
 never
 ever


been
 in
 love
 and
 definitely
 not
 been
 in


love
 you
 know
 sever
 hundred
 years
 ago
 in


an
 imaginary
 Italy
 so
 if
 you
 that's
 sort


of
 one
 of
 the
 the
 great
 uh
 sort
 of


capacities
 that
 high
 quality
 cultural


expressions
 carry
 yeah
 no
 we
 see
 I
 I've


seen
 the
 research
 and
 the
 more
 fiction


you
 read
 the
 more
 empathy
 you
 have
 yeah


why
 is
 empathy
 important
 well
 I
 guess


the
 short
 answer
 to
 that
 is
 that
 because


the
 uh
 machines
 don't
 have
 it
 right
 so


um
 they
 we
 are
 living
 in
 a
 highly


digitalized
 world
 uh


infused
 by
 artificial
 intelligence
 and


uh
 artificial
 intelligence
 uh
 is


fantastic
 as
 we
 know
 and
 so
 impressive


but
 it
 lacks
 um
 understanding
 of
 others


it
 it
 cannot
 put
 itself
 into
 somebody


else's
 clothes
 it's
 got
 no
 feelings
 uh


it
 can
 mimic
 very
 well
 also
 very
 it's


very
 good
 at
 it
 to
 to
 mimic
 empathy
 but


it's
 got
 no
 real
 authentic
 uh
 empathy


and
 um
 and
 also
 it
 it's
 got
 no
 sense


making
 uh
 capability


you
 know
 it's
 artificial
 intelligence


and
 especially
 generative
 AI
 uh
 is


basically
 all
 about
 putting
 things


together
 assembling
 texts
 or
 or
 or
 or
 or


or
 videos
 or
 uh
 uh
 or
 images
 in
 a
 way


that
 seems
 plausible
 to
 the
 human
 mind


but
 uh
 it
 cannot
 really
 say
 uh
 that
 that


that
 that
 it's
 true
 right
 uh
 it
 because


it's
 still
 hallucinating
 AI
 still
 has
 a


lot
 of
 problems
 in
 in
 uh
 in


hallucinations
 uh
 uh
 and
 uh
 thereby
 if


you
 just
 practice
 your
 human
 skills


understanding
 others
 your
 sense
 making


capabilities
 your
 your
 uh
 your
 feelings


basically
 and
 And
 the
 emotions
 those
 are


things
 that
 uh
 that
 machines
 don't
 have


so
 of
 course
 you
 should
 sort
 of
 try
 to


Foster
 them
 uh
 and
 develop
 them
 what


does
 uh
 culture
 do
 to
 the
 learning


environment
 and
 the
 ability
 to
 learn
 and


absorb
 well
 I
 think
 it
 sort
 of
 increases


the
 knowledge
 intensity
 if
 you
 it's
 kind


of
 simple
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 are
 in
 a
 if
 you


sit
 in
 a
 bunker
 it's
 not
 inspired
 ing
 uh


and
 if
 you
 are
 in
 a
 uh
 in
 in
 an


environment
 that
 sort
 of
 uh
 uh
 sort
 of


it
 it
 sort
 of
 awakens
 your
 your
 feelings


your
 uh
 also
 your
 perception
 and
 your


attention
 it
 makes
 it
 sort
 of


interesting
 and
 art
 can
 also
 I
 mean
 it


communicates
 to
 you
 not
 just
 cognitively


uh
 but
 also


emotionally
 so
 thereby
 uh
 I
 I
 think


there
 are
 sort
 of
 more
 trajectories
 or


sort
 of
 Roads
 open
 to
 learning
 and


creativity
 what
 does
 it
 do
 it's
 kind
 of


a
 leading
 question
 because
 I
 I
 agree
 I


agree
 with
 your
 view
 here
 but
 what
 do


you
 just
 to
 spell
 it
 out
 what
 do
 you


think
 it
 does
 to


creativity
 I
 think
 it
 of
 of
 course


enhances
 your
 creativity
 and
 why
 is
 that


because
 creativity
 is
 basically
 all


about
 uh
 combining
 things
 that
 are


usually
 well
 known
 but
 in
 new
 ways
 so
 if


you
 sort
 of
 open
 the
 freeways
 that
 you


have
 in
 your
 brain
 and
 in
 your


connections
 to
 others
 uh
 it's
 uh
 it's


it's
 more
 probable
 that
 you
 come
 up
 with


new
 things
 it's
 it's
 sort
 of
 if
 you
 just


walk
 on
 the
 on
 the
 track
 that
 you've


always
 been
 walking
 on
 uh
 you
 won't
 come


up
 with
 with
 with
 many
 new
 ideas
 but
 if


you
 if
 you
 are
 exposed
 to
 and
 sort
 of


urged
 to
 see
 the
 world
 in
 new
 ways
 uh
 it


creates
 something
 new
 what
 does
 it
 do
 or


have
 you
 seen
 examples
 of
 how
 it
 can


improve
 cooperation
 and
 collaboration


yeah
 absolutely
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 I
 mean


our
 entire
 environment
 uh
 is
 now
 packed


with
 art
 I
 mean
 you
 can't
 walk
 one


single
 foot
 or
 a
 meter
 uh
 without
 being


an
 exposed
 to
 an
 artwork
 uh
 and
 also
 I


think
 the
 um
 uh
 the
 development
 of
 our


of
 our
 business
 lab
 our
 incubator
 it's


now
 one
 of
 Europe's
 most
 successful
 ones


uh
 and
 I
 mean
 being
 in
 that
 type
 of


environment
 sort
 of
 just
 Sparks
 your


willingness
 to
 to
 live
 really
 right
 I


mean
 it's
 sort
 of
 it's
 an
 more


interesting
 place
 uh
 it
 uh
 it
 also
 I
 I


don't
 think
 we
 should
 underestimate
 the


fact
 that
 it's
 you
 know
 conversation


starters
 yeah
 uh
 it's
 also
 just


something
 more
 pleasant
 and
 that
 it's


fun
 you
 know
 it
 can
 actually
 be
 fun
 uh


if
 you
 have
 a
 wall
 with
 that's


completely
 empty
 or
 you
 have
 a
 wall


where
 there's
 something
 uh
 you
 know
 a


work
 of
 art
 of
 some
 kind
 something
 human


made
 uh
 and
 if
 it
 can
 if
 it
 can
 spark


your
 imagination
 or
 sort
 of
 makes
 you


tick
 somehow
 uh
 you
 can
 get
 new
 types
 of


conversations
 you
 interact
 with
 people


in
 a
 new
 way
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


perfect
 grease
 in
 uh
 in
 human


interaction
 L
 let's
 go
 into
 one
 or
 two


of
 the
 classrooms
 what
 are
 we
 where
 do


you
 want
 to
 go
 first
 where
 should
 we
 go


well
 we
 can
 go
 into
 um
 one
 uh
 but
 first


you
 come
 through
 the
 big
 door
 of


stockolm
 school
 economics
 right
 pretty


impressive
 stuff
 yes
 big
 Building
 Wealth


history
 it
 looks
 like
 a
 bank
 it
 looks


like
 a
 bank
 yeah
 that's
 the
 idea
 too
 but


then
 it
 opens
 up
 and
 you
 see
 lots
 of


funky
 stuff
 yeah
 the
 first
 thing
 you
 see


is
 uh
 it's
 a
 huge
 video
 screen
 where
 we


have
 curated
 video
 uh
 exhibitions
 in


collaboration
 with
 different
 art


institutions
 like
 the
 the
 Museum
 of


Modern
 Art
 in
 Stockholm
 Etc
 uh
 also
 with


with
 International
 but
 then
 we
 go
 into


classrooms
 then
 you
 go
 into
 classrooms


which
 one
 where
 you
 we
 can
 start
 in
 uh


one
 that's
 um
 um
 designed
 by
 Jacob


dalren
 and
 he
 say
 one
 of
 Sweden's
 most


well-known
 artists
 he's
 been
 at
 the


Venice
 banal
 Etc
 and
 what
 you
 see
 is


that
 the
 walls


uh
 are
 full
 of
 patterns
 so
 basically


looks
 uh
 you
 know
 it's
 stripes
 and


squares
 uh
 and
 different
 types
 of
 Curves


then
 if
 you
 look
 closely
 you
 see
 uh
 that


they
 are
 made
 up
 of
 first
 of
 all
 School


material
 like
 pens
 and
 pencils
 and
 also


they
 are
 made
 up
 by
 measurement


instruments
 like
 uh
 rulers
 and
 um
 yeah


different
 types
 of
 of
 measurement


instruments
 uh
 and
 they
 just
 form
 a


pattern
 so
 it's
 sort
 of
 makes
 you
 think


uh
 or
 I
 mean
 it's
 it's
 a
 clear
 comment


on
 that
 everything
 we
 do
 at
 this


academic
 institution
 is
 based
 on


measuring
 the
 world
 right
 that's
 what


researchers
 do
 uh
 they
 quantify
 it
 so


basically
 you
 can
 have
 conversations


about
 uh
 quantification
 the


quantifiable
 world
 uh
 and
 what
 what
 uh


numbers
 and
 figures
 actually
 do
 to
 you


things
 like
 what
 uh
 uh
 that
 which
 is
 not


counted
 does
 not
 count
 Etc
 these
 things


that
 uh
 you
 know
 that
 that
 we
 have
 our


kpis
 Etc
 in
 order
 to
 to
 uh
 prescribe


action
 of
 different
 kind
 through
 numbers


and
 then
 also
 uh
 you
 see
 that
 the
 the
 um


uh
 the
 shape
 of
 of
 the
 way
 that
 these


measurement
 instruments
 are
 are


assembled
 is
 in
 uh
 it's
 an
 in
 an


abstract
 form
 it's
 basically
 an
 abstract


pattern
 so
 then
 you
 can
 speak
 about


abstractions
 uh
 you
 know
 what
 because


all
 that
 higher
 education
 is
 about
 is


actually
 abstractions
 so
 if
 you
 have
 a


profit
 and
 loss
 statement
 that's
 surely


an
 abstraction
 of
 something
 more
 uh
 you


know
 uh
 real
 in
 a
 way
 so
 using
 theories


using
 models
 uh
 understanding
 the
 world


from
 a
 uh
 from
 another
 perspective
 is


all
 about
 abstractions
 and
 then
 you
 can


speak
 about
 the
 connection
 between


measuring
 and
 abstractions
 and
 then


trying
 to
 understand
 what
 abstract


thinking
 is
 all
 about
 and
 and
 just
 sort


of
 thinking
 reflecting
 on
 the
 very
 idea


of
 the
 abstract
 ract
 is
 something
 that
 a


higher
 education
 institution
 definitely


should
 do
 I
 think
 yeah
 absolutely
 well
 I


mean
 any
 report
 is
 an
 abstraction
 of
 a


company's
 finances
 for
 instance
 exactly


so
 abstraction
 I
 mean
 it's
 basically


about
 getting
 as
 much
 information
 as


possible
 uh
 into
 some
 other
 shape
 and


form
 right
 so
 it
 should
 be
 you
 know
 your


you're
 if
 you
 take
 an
 annual
 report
 the


idea
 is
 to
 show
 so
 much
 as
 you
 can
 of
 a


company
 uh
 in
 in
 a
 few
 pages
 in
 a
 few


tables
 in
 a
 few
 images
 in
 German
 uh
 or


in
 German
 language
 you
 um
 split
 between


house
 building
 and
 build
 yeah
 I'm
 not


sure
 we
 have
 a
 good
 word
 for
 it
 in
 the


Scandinavian
 language
 yeah
 we
 do


actually
 in
 Scandinavian
 we
 do
 we
 have


building
 and
 building
 but
 English
 does


not
 have
 it
 right
 and
 you
 you
 basically


educate
 uh
 the
 leaders
 of
 tomorrow
 why


is
 it
 important
 for
 Future
 Leaders
 to


have
 building
 well
 buildong
 uh
 one
 one


definition
 of
 that
 it's
 uh
 building
 is


that
 which
 is
 left
 after
 you've


forgotten
 what
 you've
 learned
 yeah
 so


that
 means
 that
 uh
 what
 you've
 forgotten


what
 you've
 learned
 I
 mean
 we
 all
 do


that
 we
 forget
 lots
 of
 things
 uh
 right


what
 years
 things
 happened
 uh
 Etc
 but


what's
 left
 is
 an
 approach
 to
 the
 world


and
 a
 stance
 to
 the
 world
 and
 a
 way
 that


you
 approach
 it
 so
 uh
 it's
 it's
 sort
 of


a
 position
 more
 than
 a
 goal
 so
 and
 the


stuff
 that
 you
 are
 doing
 how
 does
 that


um
 make
 building
 better
 well
 it
 does


because
 what
 we
 do
 is
 to
 try
 to
 we
 have


have
 an
 uh
 an
 educational
 mission
 that


we
 abbreviate
 as
 free
 F
 re
 uh
 and
 the
 F


stands
 for
 fact
 and
 science
 based


approach
 completely
 key
 in
 this
 world


right
 uh
 especially
 in
 the
 in
 the
 age
 of


generative
 AI
 when
 truths
 are
 not
 what


they
 used
 to
 be
 because
 they
 can
 now
 be


fabricated
 and
 you
 cannot
 believe
 your


eyes
 or
 your
 ears
 anymore
 so
 we're


living
 in
 some
 kind
 of
 ontological


Crisis
 where
 you
 don't
 know
 uh
 that
 what


you
 see
 actually
 exists
 so
 practicing


that
 your
 your
 fact
 and
 science-based


mindset
 is
 key
 and
 then
 the
 r
 stands
 for


reflective
 and
 self-aware
 so
 sort
 of


asking
 yourself
 you
 know
 uh
 where
 does


this
 piece
 of
 data
 come
 from
 who


benefits
 from
 this
 and
 where
 do
 my


attitudes
 my
 opinions
 and
 even
 my


feelings
 come
 from
 are
 they
 my
 own
 or


are
 they
 produced
 by
 somebody
 else
 and


then
 internalized
 by
 me
 so
 I
 think


they're
 my
 own
 important
 things
 to
 do


right
 and
 then
 the
 uh
 the
 first
 e
 stands


for
 empathetic
 and
 culturally
 literate


and
 that's
 uh
 sort
 of
 why
 we
 use
 the
 art


in
 order
 to
 create
 this
 uh
 uh
 or
 enhance


your
 empathy
 and
 your
 Cultural
 Literacy


and
 then
 the
 finally
 stands
 for


entrepreneurial
 uh
 and
 responsible
 which


means
 that
 you
 actually
 do
 something
 you


have
 uh
 agency
 so
 this
 abbreviation
 free


that
 is
 our
 definition
 of
 buum
 so
 if
 you


have
 that
 approach
 if
 you
 go
 into
 the


world
 uh
 being
 fact-based
 reflective


empathetic
 uh
 and
 entrepreneurial
 it's


sort
 of
 a
 vaccination
 to
 getting
 stuck


in
 mental
 models
 and
 theories
 that
 uh


used
 to
 be
 true
 but
 perhaps
 no
 longer


are
 so
 thereby
 it's
 sort
 of
 an
 approach


to
 to
 ensure
 some
 kind
 of
 lifelong


learning
 and
 that's
 exactly
 what
 you


need
 in
 this
 world
 that's
 changing
 so


quickly
 uh
 and
 everything
 you
 thought


was
 true
 just
 a
 week
 or
 two
 ago
 uh
 has


proven
 not
 to
 be
 so
 you
 have
 to
 be
 able


to
 shift
 your
 mindset
 to
 to
 to
 not
 sort


of
 um
 get
 stuck
 in
 the
 models
 that
 you


used
 to
 operate
 by
 what
 are
 the


challenges
 with
 you
 with
 you
 in
 a
 way


educating
 um
 a
 very
 elite
 group
 of


people
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 in
 a
 way
 going
 to


make
 them
 even
 more
 Elite
 and
 even
 less


in
 touch
 with
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 one


could
 argue
 one
 could
 uh
 argue
 that
 then


you
 could
 say
 that's
 completely
 wrong


because
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 Out


Of
 Tune
 with
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 it's


actually
 a
 way
 of
 of
 making
 them


understand
 the
 world
 much
 better
 for


instance
 empathy
 is
 one
 of
 those
 uh


ideas
 and
 and
 I
 mean
 saying
 that
 future


decision
 makers
 um
 should
 not
 have
 that


type
 of
 mindset
 that's
 really
 to
 sort
 of


give
 in
 you
 know
 if
 you're
 in
 uh
 to
 to


education
 and
 if
 you're
 educating
 the


Future
 Leaders
 and
 decision
 makers
 you


of
 course
 uh
 uh
 I
 mean
 you
 have
 to
 be


ambitious
 you
 have
 to
 uh
 make
 them


understand
 the
 world
 even
 more
 uh
 and


and
 turn
 them
 into
 much
 more
 of
 human


beings
 because
 if
 you
 don't
 uh
 they


won't
 be
 able
 to
 to
 actually
 uh
 do
 do


the
 job
 that
 they
 have
 to
 do
 cuz
 they're


they
 have
 responsibility
 to
 make
 the


world
 better
 uh
 to
 sort
 of
 at
 least
 uh


you
 know
 our
 ambition
 is
 that
 they


should
 leave
 a
 better
 World
 Behind
 than


the
 ones
 that
 they
 found
 can
 you
 measure


the
 results
 of
 this
 I
 mean
 it's
 not
 like


you
 have
 a
 scale
 on
 empathy
 that
 you
 can


measure
 people
 uh
 it
 takes
 a
 long
 time


to
 see
 whether
 they
 are
 more
 successful


leaders
 and
 so
 on
 are
 there
 is
 there
 any


way
 you
 can
 can
 measure
 that
 do
 you
 have


like
 a
 engagement
 survey
 survey
 yes
 we


do
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 hard
 and
 also


especially
 when
 you're
 in
 into


Expressions
 because
 it's
 sort
 of
 hard
 to


sort
 of
 you
 know
 measure
 how
 much
 how


much
 empathy
 uh
 and
 how
 much
 learning


did
 you
 get
 from
 going
 to
 the
 lou
 and


see
 the
 Mona
 Lisa
 how
 many
 kilos
 of


empathy
 did
 you
 gain
 from
 that
 right


it's
 hard
 um
 but
 we
 can
 do
 it
 through


different
 types
 of
 service
 uh
 a
 lot
 of


self-
 appreciation
 uh
 on
 you
 know
 how


much
 more
 free
 are
 you
 actually
 uh


that's
 one
 way
 uh
 of
 doing
 it
 but
 it


doesn't
 really
 do
 the
 job
 uh
 but
 we
 more


use
 Pro
 ceas
 in
 a
 way
 to
 say
 that
 okay


so
 our
 school
 has
 never
 been
 more


selective
 than
 it
 is
 now
 our
 students


get
 the
 jobs
 that
 they
 want
 uh
 and
 they


get
 it
 uh
 really
 really
 quickly
 the
 um


uh
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 The
 Faculty
 members


who
 apply
 to
 to
 our
 job
 openings
 are


more
 than
 ever
 uh
 the
 number
 of


corporations
 that
 sponsor
 us
 has


increased
 too
 so
 basically
 all
 our
 kpis


uh
 are
 increasing
 and
 uh
 thereby
 I
 mean


I'm
 at
 an
 academic
 institution
 so
 you


shouldn't
 uh
 confuse
 correlation
 with


causality
 but
 we
 do
 know
 that
 it's
 it's


a
 lot
 of
 correlation
 since
 we
 started


with
 all
 this
 all
 the
 kpis
 are
 pointing


in
 the
 right
 direction
 but
 we
 can't


really
 show
 and
 prove
 the
 causality
 well


I
 have
 to
 say
 if
 I
 were
 young
 again
 I'll


uh
 I
 would
 have
 applied
 great
 but
 we


have
 Executive
 Education
 you
 know
 that's


very
 good
 to
 hear
 it's
 very
 good
 to
 hear


no
 it's
 uh
 it's
 super
 appealing
 you
 come


in
 there
 and
 it's
 just
 so
 vibrant
 and


beautiful
 and
 stimulating
 and
 and
 cool


and
 fun
 it's
 actually
 fun
 because
 we've


been
 named
 in
 the
 financial
 times
 uh
 uh


it's
 I
 mean
 it's
 they
 write
 about
 us
 as


if
 we're
 an
 Art
 institution
 yeah
 uh
 in


in
 the
 national
 press
 we're
 considered


to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 most
 or
 actually
 the


most
 uh
 interesting
 Art
 institution
 in


the
 country
 which
 is
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 bit


over
 the
 top
 I
 guess
 to
 say
 that
 any


other
 school
 copying
 you
 I
 think
 I
 mean


lots
 of
 schools
 have
 art
 uh
 but
 very
 few


have
 integrated
 it
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 we


have
 I
 mean
 very
 few
 have
 classrooms


that
 are
 art
 installations
 in
 their
 own


rights
 how
 can
 you
 afford
 it
 we
 get


donations
 uh
 we
 constantly
 need
 that
 and


it's
 I
 think
 that's
 part
 of
 the
 uh
 of


the
 model
 too
 we
 want
 to
 engage
 uh
 you


know
 people
 who
 believe
 uh
 in
 this
 in
 in


the
 knowledge
 form
 actually
 and
 and
 who


who
 um
 who
 understand
 the
 importance
 of


Art
 and
 and
 what's
 also
 interesting
 that


basically
 all
 our
 big


donations
 uh
 have
 always
 started
 with


art
 so
 we
 say
 for
 fun
 sometimes
 it
 all


starts
 with
 art
 changing
 um
 t
 a
 bit
 here


um
 what
 are
 the
 qualities
 needed
 by


tomorrow's


leaders
 I
 think
 they
 are
 exactly
 free


being
 fact
 based
 being
 reflective
 being


self-aware
 uh
 being
 empathetic
 and


culturally
 literate
 and
 has
 this
 changed


like
 yes
 I
 I
 definitely
 think
 so
 I
 mean


in
 the
 old
 uh
 days
 uh
 you
 you
 I
 mean
 you


studied
 and
 then
 the
 type
 of
 knowledge


that
 you
 had
 served
 uh
 you
 know
 your


your
 you
 know
 what
 you
 wanted
 to
 do


quite
 well
 it
 doesn't
 anymore
 because


you
 really
 have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 shift


perspective
 constantly
 constantly
 seek


for
 new
 facts
 constantly
 reflect
 and


constantly
 try
 to
 put
 yourself
 into


somebody
 else's
 clothes
 I
 think
 that's


it's
 it's
 always
 been
 important
 but
 it's


even
 more
 important
 now
 because
 it's
 uh


I
 mean
 the
 the
 the
 uh
 the
 situation
 in


the
 world
 is
 changing
 so
 drastically
 and


so
 quickly
 are
 there
 all
 the
 disciplines


that
 you
 need
 to
 integrate
 into
 this
 I


mean
 why
 why
 don't
 you
 study
 why
 don't


they
 have
 to
 study
 psychology
 I
 think


that
 would
 be
 great
 too
 and
 I
 mean
 we
 do


have
 that
 I
 mean
 a
 lot
 of
 our


organizational
 Theory
 courses
 are
 uh
 you


know
 you
 got
 social
 psychology
 Etc
 into


that
 and
 then
 of
 course
 uh
 I
 mean
 you


can't
 study
 everything
 either
 right
 so


so
 uh
 well
 you
 say
 that


but
 no
 but
 I
 say
 that
 you
 have
 to
 try
 to


make
 uh
 the
 years
 that
 you
 have
 at
 your


disposal
 for
 a
 bachelor
 or
 a
 master's


program
 you
 have
 to
 work
 like
 crazy
 in


order
 to
 make
 those
 years
 as
 knowledge


intensive
 as
 possible
 and
 I
 don't
 think


all
 uh
 educational


institutions
 uh
 actually
 you
 know
 try


hard
 enough
 to
 make
 their
 environments


knowledge
 intensive
 but
 they
 sort
 of


settle
 for
 the
 academic
 knowledge
 they


settle
 for
 what
 Aristotle
 called
 epistem


um
 the
 type
 of
 knowledge
 that
 you
 can


study
 and
 then
 uh
 have
 an
 exam
 on
 where


do
 languages
 come
 into
 play
 here
 I
 I
 we


are
 now
 uh
 discussing
 to
 to
 sort
 of


introduce
 uh
 languages
 it's
 uh


especially
 if
 you're
 a
 European
 Business


School
 uh
 we
 used
 to
 have
 much
 more


Focus
 I
 mean
 in
 the
 old
 days
 when
 the


school
 started
 it
 was
 German
 then
 it
 was


Russian
 uh
 and
 then
 we
 have
 you
 know


English
 and
 and
 German
 and
 Spanish
 Etc


but
 now
 uh
 English
 or
 broken
 English
 has


become
 the
 lingua
 franaqua
 uh
 of
 the


world
 yeah
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 time


actually
 to
 uh
 uh
 I
 mean
 if
 you're


European
 business
 school
 if
 you
 if
 you


speak


other
 languages
 and
 especially
 the


European
 ones
 it's
 really
 a
 way
 of


understanding
 a
 particular
 culture
 one


of
 the
 most
 prominent
 alumni
 from
 our


school
 is
 Ola
 shanos
 he's
 the
 CEO
 of


Daimler
 uh
 Mercedes
 and
 his
 German
 is


absolutely
 perfect
 he
 would
 never
 have


gotten
 that
 job
 I
 mean
 in
 the
 German


automotive
 industry
 uh
 if
 he
 didn't


speak
 German
 so
 it's
 a
 way
 of
 opening


your
 career
 possibilities
 that
 for
 one


thing
 but
 even
 more
 than
 that
 it's
 a
 way


of
 understanding
 culture
 understanding


history
 uh
 and
 sort
 of
 understanding
 um


why
 a
 particular
 culture
 and
 Country


looks
 the
 way
 it
 does
 and
 how
 it


actually
 operates
 there
 is
 no
 real
 uh


sort
 of
 true
 understanding
 uh
 of
 a


culture
 if
 you
 don't
 speak
 uh
 that


language
 do
 you
 think
 this
 is
 also


necessary
 for
 Europe
 to
 fight
 back


against
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 I
 do
 think


so
 yes
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 uh
 I
 mean
 fight


back
 is
 one
 way
 of
 phrasing
 it
 uh
 but


also
 sort
 of
 collaborating
 even
 more
 in


in
 in
 within
 Europe
 I
 think
 and
 and
 then


and
 why
 do
 we
 need
 more
 cooperation


within
 Europe
 because
 it's
 a
 I
 mean
 we


are
 culturally
 and
 and
 sort
 of


historically
 we
 are
 tightly
 knitted


together
 uh
 and
 uh
 still
 we
 are
 in
 peace


and
 I
 think
 that's
 something
 we
 have
 to


work
 really
 hard
 to
 keep
 and
 if
 we
 if
 we


sort
 of
 uh
 join
 forces
 even
 more
 I
 think


we
 of
 course
 will
 become
 much
 more


powerful
 really
 so
 I
 also
 think
 it's
 uh


uh
 right
 now
 it's
 sort
 of
 uh
 we
 don't
 we


don't
 have
 too
 much
 self-confidence


being
 European
 uh
 we
 constantly
 hear


about
 uh
 how
 how
 Europe
 is
 lagging


behind
 and
 and
 Asia
 and
 the
 US
 are
 uh


and
 China
 especially
 uh
 are
 are
 are


moving
 especially
 in
 in
 in
 artificial


intelligence
 and
 Technology
 are
 moving


so
 quickly
 and
 we're
 just
 being
 left


behind
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a
 good


idea
 to
 just
 sit
 back
 and
 sort
 of
 feel


defeated
 uh
 but
 instead
 try
 to
 see
 what


we
 have
 uh
 try
 to
 learn
 languages
 uh


each
 other's
 languages
 to
 see
 ourselves


as
 more
 of
 an
 entity
 um
 than
 we
 are
 and


then
 realize
 that
 that
 there
 are
 lots
 of


things
 that
 are
 pretty
 good
 here
 too
 if


you
 just
 take
 Sweden
 as
 an
 example
 I


mean
 it's
 a
 highly
 Innovative
 place
 it's


a
 um
 um
 it's
 a
 country
 where
 the


financial
 markets
 are
 working
 quite
 well


we
 have
 lots
 of
 of
 private
 private


Equity
 20
 times
 more
 per
 capita
 uh
 than


Germany
 uh
 and
 sort
 of
 you
 know
 to
 just


boost
 the
 the
 the
 um
 self-confidence


because
 I
 think
 many
 other
 countries


like
 China
 like
 the
 the
 Americans
 are


pretty
 good
 uh
 when
 it
 comes
 to


self-confidence
 while
 Europeans
 aren't


what
 do
 you
 think
 are
 the
 traits
 that


you
 are
 seeing
 in
 great
 leaders
 do
 you


do
 you
 spend
 time
 observing
 leaders
 yeah


sure
 absolutely
 and
 when
 you
 abstract
 it


down
 what
 do
 they
 have
 in
 common
 why
 are


why
 are
 the
 why
 are
 the
 best
 ones
 very


good
 well
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 I
 mean
 if
 you


were
 really
 condensing
 it
 to
 a
 couple
 of


terms
 I
 would
 say
 authenticity
 yeah
 I


mean
 that
 you
 actually
 believe
 that
 what


they're
 saying
 is
 uh
 what
 they
 think
 and


that's
 not
 the
 same
 thing
 uh
 as
 not


lying
 not
 uh
 right
 uh
 but
 actually
 being


authentic
 in
 what
 you
 want
 to
 do
 uh
 and


that
 people
 feel
 that
 this
 is
 that
 it


matters
 to
 you
 that
 you're
 not
 playing
 a


game
 that
 you're
 not
 sort
 of
 politically


correct
 whatever
 that
 means
 uh
 but
 sort


of
 that
 it's
 your
 true
 self
 speaking


than
 being
 there
 I
 think
 that's
 uh


absolutely
 key
 I
 also
 think
 uh
 I
 mean


being
 able
 to
 create
 a
 sense
 of
 meaning


you
 know
 to
 make
 people
 uh
 understand


and
 feel
 that
 they're
 part
 of
 something


that's
 greater
 than
 themselves
 uh
 that


they're
 building
 something
 you
 know
 that


old
 anecdote
 where
 this
 man
 is
 sitting


and
 banging
 on
 a
 stone
 and
 then
 somebody


ask
 walks
 by
 and
 ask
 what
 are
 you
 doing


well
 I'm
 banging
 on
 a
 stone
 uh
 and
 then


and
 then
 he
 asks
 another
 one
 doing
 the


same
 thing
 and
 then
 he
 says
 well
 I'm


building
 a
 cathedral
 right
 so
 those
 I


mean
 it's
 an
 old
 uh
 sort
 of
 saying
 but
 I


think
 it's
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 Truth
 in
 that


that
 you
 see
 what
 you're
 actually
 part


of
 um
 and
 then
 I
 think
 energy
 too
 right


I
 mean
 to
 to
 be
 in
 a
 place
 where
 things


happen
 where
 uh
 where
 you
 feel
 that


you're
 part
 of
 something
 uh
 that's


moving
 you
 know
 people
 love
 being
 part


of
 that
 because
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 we've
 all


experienced
 workplaces
 or
 or
 uh


different
 types
 of
 um
 places
 where
 you


just
 feel
 that
 the
 energy
 level
 is
 slow


where
 does
 energy
 come
 from
 well
 energy


comes
 from
 I
 mean
 it's
 I
 mean
 from


inspiration
 yeah
 you
 know
 so
 so


different
 leaders
 find
 their
 energy
 in


different
 ways
 uh
 of
 course
 but
 I
 think


if
 you
 if
 you
 uh
 if
 you
 do
 not
 feel


energetic
 that
 means
 that
 you
 don't
 I


mean
 love
 is
 perhaps
 a
 a
 strong
 word
 in


this
 sense
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 it's


actually
 good
 if
 you
 don't
 love
 what


you're
 doing
 if
 you
 don't
 believe
 in


what
 you're
 doing
 yourself
 you
 will
 not


get
 that
 type
 of
 energy
 so
 you
 have


Malcolm
 Gladwell
 on
 here
 and
 he
 said
 uh


you
 get
 energy
 from
 doing
 what
 you
 love


so
 he
 ties
 in
 ties
 in


now
 is
 there
 such
 a
 thing
 as
 a
 Swedish


uh
 Leadership


Model
 or
 or
 Scandinavian
 yes
 I
 do
 think


so
 even
 though
 it's
 hard
 to
 speak
 of


those
 uh
 you
 know
 in
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 you


know
 cultural
 specificities
 but
 for
 sure


I
 mean
 it's
 something
 um
 in
 in
 the
 uh
 a


hierarchical
 idea
 uh
 that
 it
 is
 flat


that
 you
 actually
 listen
 to
 to
 uh
 what


others
 are
 saying
 that
 you
 don't
 have


the
 sort
 of
 traditional
 standing
 on
 a


mountain
 and
 pointing
 in
 One
 Direction


uh
 but
 being
 close
 to
 others
 it's


actually
 a
 quite
 quite
 an
 an
 academic


model
 in
 the
 sense
 in
 in
 the
 old
 sense


of
 the
 word
 where
 Plato
 was
 walking
 uh


together
 with
 his
 disciples
 and
 what
 was


important
 to
 him
 was
 that


everybody
 uh
 uh
 you
 know
 every
 every


argument
 counts
 it
 doesn't
 matter


seniority
 doesn't
 does
 doesn't
 matter
 uh


and
 uh
 it's
 only
 the
 argument
 in
 itself


that
 matters
 so
 that's
 what
 Plato
 said


that's
 s
 of
 the
 true
 academic
 model
 so


so
 seniority
 or
 or
 or
 or
 titles
 and


things
 like
 that
 shouldn't
 matter
 and


that's
 uh
 I
 think
 that
 could
 be


something
 that's
 quite
 visible
 uh
 in
 in


Swedish
 leadership
 flat
 hieres
 listening


to
 people
 very
 informal
 uh
 that
 it
 is


possible
 for
 anybody
 to
 actually
 call


anybody
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 that
 sort
 of
 we


see
 it
 actually
 a
 lot
 of
 lot
 of
 uh
 uh


German
 students
 especially
 come
 to
 our


school
 because
 this
 is
 uh
 how
 they've


perceived
 these
 the
 the
 uh
 the
 Swedish


model
 it's
 highly
 attractive
 I
 mean
 if


you
 want
 to
 start
 a
 company
 for
 instance


it
 creates
 sort
 of
 an
 entrepreneurial


spirit
 I
 think
 but
 tough
 for
 them
 to
 go


back
 and
 work
 in
 a
 large
 German
 company


though
 afterwards
 yes
 that's
 true
 and
 we


want
 them
 to
 stay
 of
 course
 of
 course
 um


now
 art
 in
 a
 way
 is
 um
 is
 storytelling


in
 a
 way
 right
 you
 abstract
 and
 express


uh
 a
 story
 and
 uh
 I
 in
 a
 way
 think
 that


storytelling
 is
 just
 um
 more
 and
 more


key
 and
 you
 see
 it
 when
 you
 go
 to


conferences
 and
 so
 on
 the
 people
 who
 own


the
 room
 are
 the
 people
 who
 manag
 to


translate
 uh
 something
 into
 into
 a
 story


that
 you
 remember
 yeah
 how
 are
 you


working
 on
 that
 topic
 in
 your
 school


well
 I
 think
 uh
 in
 everything
 that
 we
 do


because
 stories
 are
 actually
 just
 a
 way


of
 of


gathering
 uh
 and
 arranging
 meaning
 in
 a


way
 so
 I
 mean
 bringing
 together
 things


that
 like
 in
 our
 case
 ambition
 right
 say


I
 mean
 you
 can
 you
 can
 do
 two
 things
 you


can
 either
 say
 come
 to
 our
 school
 study


uh
 and
 and
 and
 learn
 to
 how
 to
 get
 a
 job


where
 you
 can
 actually
 support
 yourself


and
 perhaps
 be
 rich
 in
 the
 long
 run


that's
 one
 way
 of
 uh
 uh
 of
 of
 sort
 of


speaking
 about
 uh
 what
 we're
 doing
 the


other
 way
 is
 to
 say
 come
 to
 our
 school


uh
 Be
 Inspired
 learn
 to
 sort
 of
 change


the
 world
 uh
 learn
 that
 it's
 that
 this


is
 a
 place
 where
 you
 can
 actually


develop
 uh
 it's
 it's
 it's
 where
 we
 have


higher
 Ambitions
 uh
 of
 different
 kind


and
 it's
 also
 a
 a
 a
 place
 where
 you
 can


really
 feel
 that
 uh
 the
 future
 can
 look


very
 different
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 basically


everything
 is
 telling
 stories
 right
 I


mean
 everything
 that
 you're
 exposed
 to


every
 every
 aesthetic
 expression
 is


actually
 a
 story
 I
 think
 it's
 also
 even


more
 important
 in
 this
 very
 digital


world
 uh
 to
 work
 with
 physical
 artifacts


of
 different
 kind
 that
 you
 can
 feel


stuff
 and
 be
 part
 uh
 of
 something
 so


um
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 the
 the
 short
 answer


is
 that
 I
 don't
 think
 any
 organization


can
 be
 successful
 if
 it
 doesn't
 uh


communicate
 what
 it
 does
 in
 a
 meaningful


way
 now
 you
 um
 wrote
 a
 book
 called
 Kens


and
 um
 you
 there
 talk
 about
 uh
 the


importance
 of
 hiring
 people
 who
 do
 not


have
 a
 business
 background
 and
 indeed
 in


my
 previous
 life
 I
 worked
 with


historians
 and
 people
 who
 had
 stud


studied
 Theology
 and
 all
 these
 kind
 of


things
 and
 they
 were
 the
 best
 investors


and
 the
 best
 financial
 brains
 I've
 seen


so
 should
 one
 actually
 study
 business


well
 I
 think
 you
 you
 uh
 I
 I
 say
 that
 you


you
 in
 the
 book
 I
 say
 that
 you
 uh
 uh


should
 study
 business
 but
 that's
 not


enough
 you
 have
 to
 sort
 of
 open
 your


mind
 as
 well
 right
 I
 mean
 I
 love
 the


business
 school
 that
 I'm
 heading
 of


course
 and
 I
 think
 the
 subjects
 we
 need


are
 extremely
 important
 because
 they
 are


ways
 of
 understanding
 the
 world
 um
 but


it's
 it's
 all
 about
 again
 really
 sort
 of


expanding
 the
 blinders
 that
 we
 have
 to


to
 uh
 I
 mean
 every
 type
 of
 education


it's
 specialized
 right
 so
 it's
 a
 bit


like
 watching
 the
 sky
 uh
 through
 a
 straw


uh
 and
 you
 need
 to
 have
 many
 straws
 uh


nowadays
 in
 order
 to
 understand
 the


world
 that
 we're
 living
 in
 in
 America


they
 have
 many


straws
 yeah
 they
 do
 when
 you
 study


liberal
 arts


yes
 but
 liberal
 arts
 education
 programs


are
 not
 doing
 uh
 all
 that
 well
 right


yeah
 okay
 um
 now
 another
 thing
 you
 talk


about
 is
 Sport
 and
 you
 have
 a
 some
 type


of
 Sport
 Institute
 or
 what
 do
 you
 call


it
 yeah
 we
 do
 we
 have
 a
 center
 for
 sport


and
 business
 exactly
 uh
 with
 with
 which


we
 cooperate
 as
 um
 you
 know
 noras
 Bank


investment
 management
 we
 are
 doing
 some


fantastic
 projects
 together
 with
 them


very
 very
 exciting
 in
 terms
 of
 sport


psychology
 and
 and
 how
 we
 build


resilience
 and
 and
 grit
 and
 the
 ability


to
 cope
 with
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 with
 the


tough
 times
 now
 just
 where
 does
 Sport


come
 into
 education
 and
 business
 for
 you


I
 think
 it's
 basically
 uh
 a
 good


education
 program
 or
 institution


recognizes
 that
 that
 education
 is
 not


just
 about
 the
 mind
 but
 it's
 about
 mind


body
 and
 soul
 so
 it's
 sort
 of
 three


things
 going
 on
 at
 the
 same
 time
 uh
 and


also
 the
 fact
 that
 machines
 they
 do
 not


have
 any
 bodies
 they
 they
 they
 are
 very


they're
 lousy
 at
 sports
 I
 mean
 uh
 chat


GPT
 you
 will
 you
 will
 you
 will
 beat
 it


uh
 on
 the
 racetrack
 anytime
 right
 so
 uh


it
 says
 it
 doesn't
 have
 bodies
 but


humans
 do
 and
 actually


developing
 uh
 sort
 of
 you
 know
 your
 your


your
 bodily
 uh
 functions
 in
 a
 way
 is


something
 that's
 really
 important
 I
 mean


we
 know
 uh
 you
 know
 your
 cognitive


skills
 develop
 uh
 quite
 a
 bit
 through


physical
 exercise
 right
 it's
 a


connection
 uh
 and
 of
 course
 all
 these


things
 that
 that
 that
 are
 about
 the


human
 body
 uh
 that
 you
 were
 describing


yeah
 you
 know
 the
 the
 um
 sports


psychology
 uh
 Etc
 all
 these
 things


actually
 matter
 because
 human
 beings


consist
 of
 Flesh
 and
 Blood
 um
 and
 they


they
 have
 a
 a
 mind
 which
 is
 remarkable


but
 and
 and
 also
 sort
 of
 an
 interest
 in


things
 uh
 that
 are
 Beyond
 science
 too


and
 in
 a
 way
 uh
 you
 know
 poetry
 art
 uh


religion
 Etc
 right
 so
 these
 are
 things


just
 just
 viewing
 the
 human
 being


for
 everything
 that
 it
 is
 I
 think
 that's


what
 an
 educational
 institution
 should


do
 great
 schools
 do
 that
 I
 mean
 you


couldn't
 imagine
 Oxford
 or
 or
 or
 or


Cambridge
 without
 the
 rowing
 or
 uh
 some


of
 the
 some
 of
 the
 US
 uh
 universities


without
 their
 teams
 and
 their
 and
 what


can
 what
 can
 Business
 Leaders
 learn
 from


great
 athletes
 I
 think
 they
 can
 learn
 a


lot
 of
 course
 uh
 I
 mean
 it's
 the
 big
 I


mean
 they
 can
 learn
 so
 much
 everything


you
 know
 in
 in
 terms
 of
 motivation
 and


focus
 and
 uh
 uh
 and
 sort
 of
 uh
 all
 the


all
 the
 things
 that
 sport
 psychology
 has


got
 uh
 there
 is
 a
 huge
 difference
 though


it's
 that
 it's
 more
 clear
 usually
 in


sports
 what
 the
 goal
 is
 exactly
 what
 it


is
 that
 you
 are
 to
 do
 right
 I
 mean
 if


you
 you
 know
 that
 you
 are
 to
 jump
 uh
 you


know
 over
 this
 bar
 that's
 right
 here
 so


the
 the
 uh
 it's
 very
 the
 mission
 is
 is


very
 uh
 clear
 it's
 not
 as
 clear
 being
 a


a
 business
 leader
 because
 things
 can


change
 quite
 a
 bit
 Yeah
 talking
 about


change
 AI
 how
 will
 AI
 CH
 education
 or


already
 how
 does
 it
 already
 change
 it
 it


already
 has
 I
 mean
 in
 every
 way
 uh
 but


fundamentally
 it
 um
 I
 mean
 we
 know
 that


cognitively
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 artificial


intelligence
 actually
 outperforms
 us


quite
 a
 bit
 and


um
 so
 so
 uh
 it
 it
 it
 really
 changes
 and


all
 over
 the
 world
 University
 or


educators
 are
 now
 trying
 to
 understand


and
 think
 hard
 about
 how
 do
 we
 actually


secure
 uh
 learning
 uh
 can
 we
 do
 the
 same


same
 type
 of
 tests
 that
 we
 used
 to
 do


can
 we
 do
 final
 can
 we
 can
 we
 do


take-home
 exams
 do
 we
 need
 to
 uh
 you


know
 pull
 out
 the
 plug
 and
 not
 let
 them


use
 their
 computers
 should
 we
 only
 do


handwriting
 should
 we
 only
 do
 oral
 exams


Etc
 but
 it's
 kind
 of
 futile
 all
 this


because
 fundamentally
 uh
 I
 mean


generative
 Ai
 and
 AI
 is
 here
 to
 stay
 you


know
 our
 students
 don't
 even
 use
 Google


anymore
 right
 they
 use
 generative
 AI


yeah
 um


and
 and
 uh
 uh
 I
 think
 it's
 it
 poses
 much


more
 fundamental
 questions
 that
 are


about
 knowledge
 in
 itself
 so
 what
 is
 the


University
 to
 do
 when
 when
 it's
 got
 a


student
 for
 three
 years
 uh
 or
 sometimes


even
 five
 years
 you
 know
 what
 should
 you


learn
 what
 is
 the
 what's
 the
 the
 purpose


of
 it
 all
 uh
 and
 and
 and
 what
 should
 you


learn
 I
 think
 uh
 fundamentally
 it's


about
 the
 division
 of
 labor
 between


machines
 and
 human
 beings
 because


machines
 are
 great
 at
 being
 machines
 you


know
 we
 can't
 beat
 them
 in
 being


machines
 but
 they
 are
 not
 human
 and
 they


can't
 beat
 us
 in
 Being
 Human
 because


they
 are
 art
 it's
 it's
 artificial


intelligence
 it's
 not
 human
 intelligence


so
 I
 think
 educational
 institutions


should
 really
 help
 uh
 students
 to


develop
 their
 human
 intelligence
 and
 in


that
 is
 of
 course
 included
 to
 understand


how
 AI
 operates
 and
 be
 sort
 of
 uh
 able


to
 to
 to
 interact
 uh
 with
 AI
 but
 you
 but


uh
 but
 then
 also
 developing
 your
 human


skills
 so
 developing
 your
 empathy
 uh


developing
 your
 sense
 making
 your


understanding
 of
 the
 world
 your


contextualization


capabilities
 uh
 your
 your
 uh
 your


language
 skills
 uh
 all
 these
 things
 that


that
 uh
 um
 you
 know
 AI
 is
 is
 doing
 but


not
 doing
 to
 the
 same
 extent
 so
 it's


basically
 trying
 to
 be
 how
 do
 we
 become


you
 know
 even
 better
 humans
 as
 the


machines
 are
 are
 are
 becoming
 better
 at


what
 they're
 doing
 do
 you
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 more
 of
 an
 advantage
 to
 be


an


extrovert
 in
 the
 future
 do
 you
 think
 the


Nerds
 will
 be
 eaten
 by
 AI
 I
 I
 I
 don't


ever
 think
 that
 anything
 will
 eat


anything
 else
 first
 of
 all
 I
 think


that's
 sort
 of
 a
 view
 of
 the
 world
 where


uh
 you
 know
 one
 thing
 sort
 of
 um
 uh


completely
 wipes
 out
 something
 else
 I


think
 it's
 always
 a
 matter
 of
 a
 lay


hearing
 you
 know
 things
 are
 are
 being
 on


being
 put
 on
 top
 of
 of
 each
 other
 having


said
 that
 yes
 I
 think
 it's
 um
 uh
 the
 way


that
 you
 need
 to
 be
 a
 nerd
 in
 the
 future


needs
 to
 change
 perhaps
 in
 ways
 well
 I


suppose
 to
 uh
 to
 be
 a
 a
 a
 little
 bit


more


um
 uh
 sort
 of
 trying
 to
 understand
 the


systems
 in
 themselves
 uh
 and
 not
 sort
 of


operate
 within
 the
 systems
 so
 being


understanding
 how
 the
 general
 sort
 of


EOS
 system
 uh
 Works
 what's
 the
 future


for
 phds
 well
 I
 think
 the
 the
 uh
 uh
 the


future
 for
 phds
 is
 is
 is
 bright
 actually


uh
 you
 say
 that
 just
 because
 it's
 the


most
 profitable
 part
 of
 your
 business


it's
 actually
 the
 less
 or
 the
 least


profitable
 because
 we
 have
 to
 educate


them
 for
 so
 long
 no
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 uh


it's
 not
 you
 know
 because
 that's
 if
 you


think
 that
 PhD
 is
 all
 about
 specializing


in
 one
 particular
 subject
 that
 then
 it's


going
 to
 be
 gone
 but
 it's
 not
 because
 a


PhD
 education
 is
 actually
 uh
 uh
 about


learning
 how
 to
 process
 large
 materials


uh
 big
 big
 um
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 masses
 of


data
 analyzing
 things
 putting
 them
 into


New
 Perspectives
 uh
 also
 trying
 to


express
 yourself
 both
 in
 writing
 and
 in


uh
 or
 and
 orally
 uh
 so
 I
 think
 you
 know


to
 have
 a
 a
 a
 researchers


mindset
 uh
 because
 that's
 what
 you
 train


PhD
 is
 not
 about
 a
 PhD
 dissertation
 but


it's
 about
 uh
 training
 and
 individual


and
 that
 individual
 will
 be
 needed
 uh


even
 more
 I
 think
 in
 the
 future
 L
 Runing


off
 with
 some
 personal
 things
 um
 what's


the
 piece
 of
 art
 that's
 made
 the
 most


impression
 on
 you
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


mark
 Rothco
 painting
 uh
 which
 is
 I
 think


it's
 sort
 of
 uh
 Magic
 is
 is
 perhaps
 the


wrong
 word
 but
 uh
 I
 mean
 it's
 just
 paint


just
 colors
 uh
 it's
 uh
 it's
 a
 bit
 um


blurry
 at
 the
 edges
 and
 somehow
 uh
 you


know
 it
 just
 creates
 this
 emotion
 which


is
 absolutely
 impossible
 to
 explain
 why


and
 I
 think
 it's
 you
 know
 to
 to
 to
 be


able
 to
 create
 that
 type
 of
 of
 feeling


and
 I
 I
 once
 actually
 just
 cried
 in


front
 of
 those
 of
 of
 one
 of
 those


paintings
 there's
 a
 book
 about
 people


crying
 in
 front
 yeah
 exactly
 so
 there's


a
 book
 on
 that
 so
 I
 felt
 just
 like
 you


know
 I'm
 just
 I'm
 just
 I'm
 just
 an


ordinary
 guy
 right
 because
 this
 happens


to
 everyone
 it's
 interesting
 you
 know


that
 it's
 just
 it
 it's
 this
 emotional


connection
 that's
 very
 hard
 to
 um
 uh


analyze
 and
 and
 to
 give
 a
 rational


explanation
 too
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 one
 of


the
 powers
 of
 art
 really
 and
 I
 think


it's
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 if
 you
 watch
 good


films
 uh
 I
 mean
 just
 going
 into
 a
 cinema


when
 the
 lights
 go
 down
 and
 you're
 just


being
 pushed
 and
 or
 rather
 pulled
 into


this
 world
 that
 you
 haven't
 been
 in
 or


reading
 a
 book
 what
 do
 you
 read
 well


right
 now
 I'm
 actually
 I've
 been
 reading


uh
 a
 couple
 of
 Classics
 so
 I've
 been


reading
 Joseph
 Conrad's
 Heart
 of


Darkness
 absolutely
 terrible
 book
 uh
 or


in
 the
 that
 it's
 scary
 it's


fantastically
 written
 uh
 the
 language
 is


amazing
 uh
 and
 you're
 just
 being
 sort
 of


pulled
 in
 to
 um
 to
 uh
 the
 Belgian
 Congo


a
 long
 time
 ago
 into
 the
 river
 into
 the


river
 exactly
 so
 you
 know
 the
 language


you
 just
 feel
 that
 you're
 there
 it's


just
 that's
 what
 great
 cultural


expressions
 can
 do
 again
 move
 you
 into


other
 times
 and
 other
 spaces
 and
 make


you
 see
 the
 world
 in
 New
 Perspective


it's
 it's
 something
 that
 we
 need
 so
 much


of
 uh
 in
 the
 time
 that
 we're
 living
 in


now
 if
 you
 were
 not
 an
 educator
 what


would
 you
 do
 I
 wouldn't
 mind
 running
 a


cultural
 institution
 actually


right
 well
 that's
 that
 that's
 an


educator
 as
 well
 right
 that's
 true


that's
 true
 well
 I'm
 sure
 you
 do
 you'll


do
 well
 now
 um
 lastly
 what
 advice
 do
 you


hang
 have
 for
 young
 people
 I
 think
 uh
 to


really
 try
 to
 expose
 your
 yourself
 to


things
 that
 you
 don't
 understand
 that


you're
 not
 used
 to
 and
 really
 uh
 try
 to


push
 yourself
 into
 uh
 you
 know
 out
 of


the
 box
 or
 out
 of
 your
 comfort
 zone
 or


whatever
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it
 but
 doing


things
 that
 you
 wouldn't
 expect
 yourself


to
 do
 great
 piece
 of
 advice
 um
 big
 big


thanks
 for
 for
 being
 here
 and
 uh
 please


look
 out
 for
 my
 application
 for
 your


executive
 program
 thanks
 so
 much
 for


having
 me
 great
 thank
 you
