Have
 you
 ever
 wondered
 why
 France
 hasn't


been
 known
 as
 the
 place
 for
 tech
 in


Europe?
 While
 everyone
 was
 watching


London's
 fintech
 boom,
 something


extraordinary
 happened
 in
 France.
 The


country
 that
 gave
 us
 bureaucratic


nightmares
 produced
 Mistral
 AI,
 Europe's


answer
 to
 open
 AI.
 The
 UAE
 committed
 50


billion
 euros
 to
 build
 the
 continent's


largest
 AI
 center
 campus
 in
 France.


France's
 tech
 is
 powered
 by
 quite


literally
 56
 nuclear
 reactors,
 pumping


out
 cheap
 electricity
 and
 leaving
 all
 of


its
 neighbors
 behind.
 But
 this
 nuclear


advantage
 is
 coming
 from
 deeply
 rooted


colonial
 past
 that
 is
 actively


crumbling.
 So
 how
 did
 the
 land
 of


endless
 strikes
 and
 rigid
 labor
 laws


become
 Europe's
 AI
 battleground?
 And
 can


this
 nuclearpowered
 tech
 boom
 survive


what's
 coming
 next?
 Hi
 everybody.
 This


is
 the
 final
 episode,
 episode
 10
 of
 my


series,
 Where
 to
 Run,
 where
 I
 research


how
 mid
 to
 senior
 tech
 professionals
 are


rebuilding
 their
 lives
 and
 careers
 in


the
 aftermath
 of
 the
 post-pandemic,
 post


layoff
 AI
 first
 era.
 and
 we're
 wrapping


up
 the
 series
 with
 the
 land
 of
 liberty,


equality,
 and
 fraternity,
 France.
 This


video
 series
 is
 for
 tech
 professionals


already
 living
 and
 working
 in
 the
 US,


Canada,
 the
 UK,
 or
 the
 European
 Union.


If
 you're
 based
 outside
 these
 regions
 or


in
 an
 outsourcing
 heavy
 market,
 the
 data


in
 this
 video
 will
 not
 apply
 to
 your


situation.
 I
 do
 not
 cover
 immigration,


international
 job
 hunting,
 or
 topics


like
 how
 to
 break
 into
 tech
 without
 a


college
 degree.
 If
 that's
 what
 you're


here
 for,
 this
 probably
 isn't
 the
 right


channel,
 and
 that's
 okay.
 But
 if
 you
 are


operating
 within
 these
 markets,
 keep


watching.
 There's
 a
 lot
 ahead
 for


various
 seniority
 levels
 and
 career


tracks
 in
 tech.
 Please
 give
 us
 a
 thumbs


up.

 working
 very
 hard

 And
 as
 always,
 we're
 starting


with
 tech
 scene
 and
 culture.

 has
 a
 compound
 annual


growth
 rate
 of
 7.7%
 since
 2019.
 This


growth
 is
 not
 explosive,
 but
 it's


structural
 and
 very
 methodical.

The
 30
 to
 50
 billion
 euro
 AI

initiative
 between
 the
 UAE
 and
 France


announced
 in
 early
 2025
 the
 development


of
 Euro's
 largest
 artificial
 intelligent


data
 center
 campus
 in
 France
 and
 the


development
 of
 one
 of
 the
 world's


largest
 lowcarbon
 supercomputers
 using


France's
 nuclearpowered
 and
 lowcarbon


electricity
 grid.
 Now,
 why
 is
 such
 a
 big


range
 between
 30
 and
 50?
 Because
 the


final
 number
 depends
 on
 the
 duration
 of


each
 phase.
 France
 explicitly
 aims
 to
 be


a
 third
 pole
 of
 AI
 power
 seeking
 to


compete
 with
 the
 US
 and
 China
 while


fostering
 European
 AI
 sovereignty
 and


strategic
 autonomy.
 For
 those
 of
 you
 who


have
 been
 watching
 the
 where
 to
 run


series,
 you
 know
 that
 I
 always
 try
 to


look
 for
 things
 that
 make
 each
 country


unique.
 In
 Sweden,
 it's
 the
 highest


number
 of
 unicorns
 per
 capita.
 In


Switzerland,
 it's
 the
 semiconductor


market.
 In
 Saudi
 Arabia,
 it's
 heavily


funded
 and
 crazy
 ambitious
 government


projects.
 In
 France,
 its
 biggest


advantage
 lies
 in
 its
 clean
 and


affordable
 energy
 for
 AI
 infrastructure


and
 a
 very
 coordinated
 techoriented


national
 strategy.
 Now,
 what
 is
 it
 about


the
 affordable
 strategy
 that
 makes


France
 the
 biggest
 hub
 for
 AI
 data


centers?
 France's
 energy
 advantage
 for


AI
 infrastructure
 stems
 from
 its
 nuclear


dominated
 energy
 mix
 which
 insulates
 it


from
 price
 shocks
 affecting
 fossil
 fuel


dependent
 nations
 like
 Germany.
 I
 want


to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 why
 the


energy
 crisis
 in
 Germany
 is
 much
 more


pronounced
 than
 in
 France
 and
 why
 the


tech
 industry
 in
 Germany
 was
 hit
 harder.


This
 strategic
 difference
 became


particularly
 stark
 after
 2022
 when


Europe
 stopped
 relying
 on
 the
 Russian


gas.
 Now,
 if
 you're
 wondering
 what
 does


gas
 have
 to
 do
 with
 nuclear
 energy
 and


why
 I'm
 comparing
 the
 two,
 let
 me


explain.
 Germany's
 problem
 is
 its


electricity
 market's
 dependence
 on


natural
 gas.
 The
 price
 of
 electricity
 in


Germany
 is
 heavily
 impacted
 by
 the
 cost


of
 gas
 fired
 power
 plants.
 Electricity


remains
 expensive
 in
 Germany
 in
 2025,


consistently
 ranking
 among
 the
 highest


in
 Europe
 and
 globally
 for
 both


households
 and
 industry.
 When
 the
 war
 in


Ukraine
 began
 and
 Germany
 stopped
 buying


Russian
 gas,
 the
 electricity
 prices


surged,
 impacting
 all
 electricity


consumers,
 including
 data
 centers.
 In


France,
 the
 prices
 didn't
 surge
 because


their
 data
 centers
 are
 using
 the
 grid


that
 is
 mostly
 nuclearpowered.
 France


did
 have
 some
 issues
 due
 to
 the
 reactor


corrosion
 and
 the
 necessary
 maintenance,


but
 the
 energy
 crisis
 is
 not
 nearly
 as


bad
 as
 it
 is
 in
 Germany.
 Germany's


challenge
 is
 that
 even
 after
 reducing


direct
 gas
 use,
 its
 electricity
 prices


remained
 high
 due
 to
 the
 way
 the
 market


is
 structured
 around
 gas
 fired
 power.


Now,
 a
 few
 more
 data
 points
 on
 the


French
 energy
 system.
 56
 to
 57
 reactors


generate
 70%
 of
 France's
 electricity
 at


22%
 below
 EU
 average
 residential
 prices.


Nuclear
 power
 provides
 247
 base
 load


power
 which
 is
 critical
 for
 energy


hungry
 AI
 data
 centers
 with
 costs


largely
 decoupled
 from
 global
 gas


markets.
 Macron's
 administration


provides
 permits
 and
 actively
 markets


France's
 abundant
 decarbonized


electricity
 to
 AI
 firms.
 They've
 got


their
 marketing
 covered
 on
 a
 very
 high


level.
 Now,
 you
 may
 wonder
 why
 isn't


Germany
 doing
 the
 same?
 Well,
 it's
 not


like
 they
 can't
 pull
 it
 off.
 It's
 just


that
 there
 are
 reasons
 why
 they
 cannot


match
 France's
 energy
 potential.
 As
 of


today,
 Germany
 has
 shut
 down
 its
 last


three
 nuclear
 reactors
 in
 April
 2023
 as


part
 of
 a
 long-standing
 phase
 out


policy.
 As
 of
 2025,
 nuclear
 accounts
 for


less
 than
 2%
 of
 Germany's
 electricity


generation.
 The
 country
 now
 relies
 more


heavily
 on
 renewables
 and
 when
 needed,


fossil
 fuels,
 especially
 natural
 gas
 and


coal,
 making
 its
 electricity
 supply
 more


exposed
 to
 price
 volatility.
 While
 there


are
 political
 discussions
 about
 possibly


reactivating
 recently
 decommissioned


reactors,
 strong
 anti-uclear
 sentiment


makes
 a
 nuclear
 revival
 unlikely
 in
 the


short
 term.
 As
 a
 result,
 German
 data


centers
 cannot
 access
 the
 same
 scale
 of


stable
 nuclear
 electricity
 as
 those
 in


France.
 Now,
 let's
 dig
 into
 why
 the


nuclear
 grid
 is
 so
 important
 for
 AI
 data


centers.
 AI
 data
 centers
 require


massive,
 reliable,
 and
 preferably


lowcarbon
 electricity
 supplies.
 France's


nuclear
 system
 enables
 it
 to
 offer
 both


the
 scale
 and
 the
 stability
 needed
 for


hyperscale
 AI
 computing
 while
 offering


competitive
 pricing
 and
 a
 lowcarbon


footprint.
 Germany's
 reliance
 on


renewables
 and
 gas
 means
 higher
 price


volatility,
 less
 predictability,
 and


currently
 lower
 ability
 to
 guarantee
 the


kind
 of
 roundthe-clock
 large-scale
 power


that
 AI
 data
 centers
 demand.
 Lastly,
 and


I
 promise
 this
 is
 the
 last
 bit
 on
 the


France's
 nuclear
 industry.
 Why
 why
 of


all
 places
 is
 France
 so
 big
 on
 nuclear?


Now,
 there's
 going to
 be
 a
 lot
 of


interesting
 facts.
 France's
 nuclear


energy
 strategy
 is
 deeply
 rooted
 in


historical,
 geopolitical,
 and
 economic


factors
 and
 their
 colonial
 legacy.


France
 began
 its
 course
 at
 nuclear


future
 to
 achieve
 energy
 independence
 in


1974,


the
 catalyst
 for
 which
 was
 the
 1973
 oil


crisis.
 By
 the
 mid80s,
 nuclear
 provided


70%
 of
 France's
 electricity,
 peaking
 at


71.7%
 in
 2018.
 Now,
 to
 be
 able
 to
 rely


on
 nuclear
 energy
 for
 such
 a
 long
 time


and
 making
 it
 so
 stable
 and
 predictable,


a
 country
 needs
 to
 have
 a
 steady
 nuclear


fuel
 sourcing
 because
 nuclear
 energy


doesn't
 just
 appear
 out
 of
 nowhere.
 So,


where
 has
 France
 been
 sourcing
 its


uranium
 from?
 It's
 been
 sourcing
 it
 from


one
 of
 the
 biggest
 colonies
 in
 West


Africa,
 Niger.
 France
 secured
 uranium


rights
 after
 Niger's
 1960
 independence.


Niger
 supplied
 20%
 of
 France's
 uranium


over
 the
 past
 decade
 and
 it
 has
 been


historically
 critical
 to
 France's


nuclear
 strategy.
 In
 the
 following


years,
 France
 did
 diversify.
 Currently,


they're
 getting
 27%
 of
 fuel
 from


Kazakhstan,
 19
 from
 Isbekiststan,
 and


11%
 from
 Australia.
 As
 of
 today,
 Niger's


global
 share
 is
 modest.
 Only
 4%
 of
 the


world
 production,
 but
 its
 high-grade
 ore


was
 strategically
 extremely
 valuable.


Which
 other
 countries
 in
 Africa
 supplied


nuclear
 fuel
 to
 France?
 Namibia.
 Namibia


is
 one
 of
 the
 world's
 top
 uranium


producers
 and
 has
 been
 a
 regular


supplier
 to
 France,
 especially
 when


France
 diversified
 its
 sources
 in
 recent


years
 to
 reduce
 reliance
 on
 Niger.
 South


Africa,
 a
 major
 uranium
 exporter,
 has


also
 supplied
 uranium
 to
 France,


although
 its
 role
 has
 diminished
 over


time
 as
 mining
 output
 declined
 and


global
 supply
 chains
 shifted.
 So
 what


happened
 to
 Niger?
 And
 this
 piece
 of


news
 is
 actually
 very
 recent.
 Nigra's


military
 authorities
 nationalized
 the


Somare
 mine
 in
 2025,
 expelling
 France's


Orana
 and
 seizing,
 1100
 tons
 of
 uranium.


Russian
 and
 Chinese
 political
 influence


is
 rising
 rapidly
 in
 Africa,
 where
 the


Russian
 state
 atomic
 energy
 corporation


is
 now
 controlling
 Niger's
 uranium.


China
 has
 invested
 282
 billion
 euros
 in


African
 trade
 and
 built
 infrastructure,


displacing
 French
 economic
 influence.


Military
 coups
 in
 Mali,
 Burkina
 Faso,


and
 Chad
 ended
 French
 military


operations
 in
 Africa.
 Thanks
 to


diversification,
 the
 French
 managed
 to


prevent
 immediate
 shortage.
 It
 is


estimated
 that
 the
 existing
 uranium


stocks
 should
 be
 able
 to
 cover
 2
 years


of
 reactor
 needs
 with
 depleted
 uranium


reserves,
 adding
 7
 to
 8
 years
 of
 buffer.


But
 France
 is
 yet
 to
 see
 long-term


implications.
 Loss
 of
 influence
 in


Africa
 weakens
 France's
 energy


diplomacy.
 China
 and
 Russia
 now
 dominate


45%
 of
 global
 uranium
 enrichment


capacity,
 potentially
 raising
 costs
 for


France.
 So
 France's
 reliance
 on
 nuclear


energy
 and
 AI
 data
 center
 ambitions
 face


very
 real
 disruption
 risks
 from
 global


political
 shifts.
 So
 far,
 in
 the
 short


term,
 it
 looks
 very
 promising.


Long-term,
 France
 faces
 growing


anti-uclear
 sentiment,
 although
 Macron's


pro-uclear
 stance
 will
 keep
 things
 at


bay
 at least
 until
 2027.
 Now,
 back
 to


tech.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 our
 favorite


thing,
 the
 layoffs.
 In
 2022
 and
 23,


France
 was
 less
 affected
 by
 large-scale


tech
 layoffs
 compared
 to
 other
 western


countries.
 According
 to
 layoffs
 FYI,


only
 a
 dozen
 or
 so
 of
 French
 companies


reported
 cuts
 totaling
 fewer
 than
 a


thousand
 jobs
 by
 mid
 2023.
 The
 notable


layoffs
 included
 Miro
 350
 jobs,
 Jelly


Smack
 nearly
 200
 jobs,
 Pay
 Fit
 200
 jobs,


Back
 Market
 less
 than
 100
 jobs,
 Open


Classrooms
 announced
 a
 redundancy
 plan,


Hugging
 Face
 less
 than
 10
 employees.


2024
 and
 25,
 the
 pace
 of
 layoffs


increased
 as
 funding
 conditions


tightened
 and
 market
 volatility
 grew.
 St


Micro,
 you
 remember
 it
 from
 the


Switzerland
 video,
 announced
 in
 May
 2025


that
 it
 would
 cut
 around
 1,000
 jobs
 in


France,
 which
 is
 9%
 of
 the
 French


workforce,
 as
 part
 of
 a
 broader
 plan
 to


reduce
 almost
 3,000
 jobs
 globally
 by


2027.
 Nevertheless,
 while
 France's


layoffs
 have
 grown,
 the
 overall
 number


remains
 lower
 than
 in
 the
 US,
 UK,
 or


Germany,
 where
 thousands
 of
 people
 have


been
 laid
 off
 in
 single
 rounds.
 No
 major


layoffs
 in
 product
 engineering
 or
 R&D
 at


Mistral
 AI
 or
 other
 similar
 leading
 edge


French
 AI
 companies.
 Layoffs
 across


French
 tech
 have
 primarily
 affected


sales
 support
 and
 legacy
 operations,
 not


core
 technical
 teams.
 The
 narrative
 of


AIdriven
 cuts
 in
 engineering
 is
 much


more
 pronounced
 in
 US
 tech
 giants
 than


among
 France's
 top
 AI
 innovators.
 And
 I


promise
 you
 we
 will
 be
 talking
 about
 AI


related
 layoffs,
 but
 as
 of
 today
 the


layoffs
 that
 we're
 seeing
 are
 not


AIdriven.
 Now,
 when
 talking
 about
 Europe


in
 the
 context
 of
 tech,
 France
 hasn't


really
 been
 known
 as
 the
 place
 for
 a


tech
 career.
 Education,
 yes,
 by
 all


means,
 but
 tech
 career,
 not
 so
 much.
 So,


let's
 look
 into
 the
 why.
 Why
 isn't


France
 considered
 as
 one
 of
 the
 best


destinations
 for
 the
 European
 tech?


Complex
 labor
 laws
 and
 worker


protection.
 The
 very
 laws
 that
 help
 the


Netherlands
 avoid
 mass
 layoffs
 make
 it


very
 difficult
 for
 employers
 to


restructure
 quickly.
 and
 even
 the


Netherlands
 have
 somewhat
 more
 flexible


labor
 practices
 despite
 also
 having
 very


strong
 worker
 protections.
 And
 that
 is


when
 our
 camera
 stopped
 working.
 If
 I


look
 any
 different,
 it's
 because
 we
 are


recording
 the
 second
 part
 on
 a
 different


day.
 So
 there
 you
 go.
 The
 very
 laws
 that


help
 the
 Netherlands
 avoid
 mass
 layoffs


make
 it
 difficult
 for
 employers
 to


restructure
 quickly.
 And
 even
 the


Netherlands
 have
 somewhat
 more
 flexible


labor
 market
 practices
 despite
 having


strong
 worker
 protections.
 This
 is
 the


reason
 why
 international
 companies
 do


not
 want
 to
 adapt
 to
 the
 regulations


that
 France
 is
 imposing,
 which
 makes
 it


less
 attractive
 for
 fast
 scaling
 and


restructuring
 businesses.
 This
 rigidity


often
 deters
 startups
 and
 companies
 that


value
 flexibility
 and
 rapid
 scaling.


Now,
 how
 come
 the
 Netherlands
 is
 more


popular
 destinations
 for
 tech
 workers


than
 France
 despite
 both
 countries


having
 very
 strict
 labor
 laws?
 The


Netherlands
 is
 more
 popular
 than
 France


among
 tech
 workers
 due
 to
 a
 combination


of
 ecosystem
 openness,
 work
 culture,
 and


international
 accessibility.
 The
 Dutch


tech
 force,
 engineers,
 data
 scientists,


product
 managers
 make
 between
 15
 to
 20%


more
 than
 the
 French.
 English
 is
 widely


used
 in
 the
 workplace,
 making
 it
 a
 lot


easier
 for
 international
 professionals


to
 integrate.
 France
 is
 known
 for
 more


restrictive
 immigration
 policies,
 less


competitive
 salaries,
 and
 working


conditions
 that
 are
 often
 seen
 as
 less


attractive
 by
 global
 standards.
 Dutch


companies
 emphasize
 a
 flat
 egalitarian


work
 culture,
 direct
 communication,
 and


work
 life
 balance,
 including
 hybrid
 and


4-day
 work
 weeks,
 which
 is
 highly


appealing
 to
 tactalities
 seeking


stability
 and
 a
 sense
 of
 value
 beyond


job
 titles.
 In
 contrast,
 French


corporate
 culture
 tends
 to
 be
 more


hierarchical
 with
 decision-making


concentrated
 at
 the
 very
 top.
 While


France
 has
 improved
 its
 corporate
 tax


climate
 and
 it
 invests
 heavily
 in
 tech


and
 innovation,
 the
 Dutch
 ecosystem


seems
 to
 be
 more
 accessible
 and
 more


attractive
 to
 tech
 workers
 coming
 from


abroad.
 Heavy
 taxation
 and
 bureaucracy.


France
 has
 a
 reputation
 for
 a
 high
 tax


burden
 and
 complex
 administrative


requirements,
 which
 is
 a
 barrier
 for


entrepreneurs
 and
 foreign
 investors.


Labor
 unions
 and
 a
 large
 public
 sector


can
 slow
 down
 reforms
 and
 make
 it
 harder


to
 innovate
 or
 pivot
 quickly.
 Innovation


and
 startup
 culture.
 France
 has
 excelled


in
 deep
 tech
 and
 industrial
 innovation,


nuclear,
 aerospace,
 stuff
 like
 that.
 But


it
 has
 historically
 lagged
 in
 consumer


focused
 tech.
 Collaboration
 between


universities,
 startups,
 and
 corporates


have
 not
 been
 as
 deep
 or
 as
 effective
 as


in
 the
 UK,
 Sweden,
 or
 the
 US.
 Although,


it
 is
 worth
 noting
 that
 it
 is
 improving.


Now,
 onto
 the
 recent
 shifts
 and
 Paris's


rise.
 Paris
 has
 now
 overtaken
 London
 in


some
 tech
 ecosystem
 metrics
 with
 5.3


times
 increase
 in
 startup
 enterprise


value
 from
 2017
 to
 2024
 compared
 to


London's
 4.2.
 The
 city
 is
 attracting


major
 investments
 from
 global
 tech


giants
 like
 Microsoft,
 Meta,
 Google
 and


OpenAI
 and
 producing
 unicorns
 like


Mistral
 AI
 and
 Poolside.
 However,
 the


overall
 French
 ecosystem
 is
 still


catching
 up
 in
 terms
 of
 liquidity
 exits


and
 the
 depth
 of
 its
 scaleup
 pipeline


compared
 to
 the
 UK
 or
 Germany.
 Another


trend
 I
 found
 as
 I
 was
 doing
 the


research
 is
 that
 the
 most
 top
 management


in
 France
 are
 graduates
 of
 Grol.
 Over


60%
 of
 the
 managing
 directors
 and
 chief


executives
 of
 France's
 100
 largest
 firms


hold
 degrees
 from
 the
 same
 institutions.


The
 dominance
 of
 these
 schools
 is
 very


pronounced
 and
 it
 is
 widely
 discussed
 as


a
 defining
 feature
 of
 French
 corporate


culture
 with
 alumni
 networks
 from
 these


schools
 playing
 a
 powerful
 role
 in


hiring
 and
 promotion
 decisions.
 This


trend
 is
 often
 criticized
 for


perpetuating
 a
 closed
 elite
 at
 the


highest
 levels
 of
 French
 business
 and


government
 and
 it
 remains
 a


wellocumented
 and
 persistent
 reality.


Quality
 of
 talent.
 France
 is


internationally
 recognized
 for
 producing


top
 tier
 talent
 in
 technical
 and


analytical
 fields
 particularly
 in


engineering,
 mathematics
 and
 computer


science.
 Traditionally,
 French


organizational
 culture
 has
 been


characterized
 by
 hierarchy
 and
 at
 times


adversarial
 employer
 employee
 dynamics.


However,
 the
 younger
 generation
 of


French
 tech
 force
 is
 much
 more
 flexible,


less
 likely
 to
 expect
 lifelong


employment
 within
 a
 single
 company
 and


place
 a
 premium
 on
 work
 life
 balance,


early
 responsibility
 and
 meaningful


work.
 France
 ranks
 highly
 in
 global


talent
 competitiveness,
 especially
 in


the
 supply
 of
 technicians
 and
 academia


talent.
 The
 country
 is
 also
 a
 leader
 in


R&D
 expenditure
 and
 high
 value
 exports


reflecting
 its
 engineering
 strength.


Nevertheless,
 there
 are
 concerns
 about


brain
 drain
 with
 some
 of
 the
 best
 French


trained
 talent
 moving
 abroad,


particularly
 to
 tech
 hubs
 like
 the


Silicon
 Valley
 or
 London.
 Now,
 let's


talk
 about
 outsourcing
 trends.
 Roles


that
 require
 deep
 integration
 with


business
 strategy,
 close
 collaboration


with
 French
 clients,
 or
 a
 nuanced


understanding
 of
 local
 regulations
 such


as
 product
 ownership,
 tech
 leadership,


client-f
 facing
 consulting,
 and
 R&D


management
 are
 typically
 kept
 in-house


in
 France.
 The
 roles
 that
 tend
 to
 be


outsourced
 are
 software
 developers
 and


engineers.
 These
 remain
 the
 most


frequently
 nearshore
 roles
 especially


for
 web
 mobile
 and
 enterprise


application
 development.
 France
 tends
 to


offshore
 mostly
 to
 North
 Africa
 and
 a


little
 bit
 less
 frequently
 to
 central


and
 eastern
 Europe.
 Also
 cloud


engineering
 and
 devops,
 junior
 data


scientists
 and
 AI
 engineers
 and
 cyber


security
 experts
 as
 well.
 French


companies
 increasingly
 nearshore
 cyber


security
 operations
 and
 monitoring
 to


trusted
 partners
 in
 nearby
 regions.
 And


lastly,
 project
 management
 is
 also
 a


function
 that
 is
 typically
 outsourced.


The
 UK
 leads
 in
 outsourcing
 volume,


especially
 in
 tech
 and
 ICT.
 But
 France


is
 rapidly
 closing
 the
 gap
 with
 a
 strong


shift
 towards
 nearshoring.
 All
 three,


the
 UK,
 France,
 and
 Germany
 are
 moving


away
 from
 traditional
 offshoring
 to


nearshoring
 for
 better
 time
 and
 cultural


alignment.
 The
 vibe
 creativity
 is
 deeply


embedded
 in
 the
 French
 culture.
 French


startups
 are
 known
 for
 combining


technical
 excellence
 with
 original,


often
 bold
 ideas,
 reflecting
 a
 national


tradition
 of
 beauty
 and
 artistry.
 Now,


French
 tech
 has
 a
 big
 influence
 from
 the


government.
 I
 would
 say
 that
 this
 is
 one


of
 the
 signature
 features
 of
 the
 French


tech.
 The
 role
 that
 the
 French


government
 plays
 in
 tech
 is
 central
 in


nurturing
 the
 tech
 sector,
 offering


significant
 funding,
 tax
 incentives,
 and


streamlined
 visa
 processes
 for


international
 talent.
 Initiatives
 like


La
 French
 Tech,
 the
 French
 Tech
 visa,


and
 the
 deep
 tech
 plan
 are
 designed
 to


attract
 talent
 and
 investment,
 making


France
 highly
 accessible
 for
 global


entrepreneurs
 and
 professionals.
 The


government
 is
 unusually
 active
 in


supporting
 startups
 from
 funding
 to


infrastructure
 to
 international


promotion
 which
 is
 less
 common
 in
 other


European
 countries.
 Macron
 even
 before


becoming
 president
 was
 instrumental
 in


launching
 La
 French
 Tech,
 a


governmentbacked
 initiative
 that


provides
 funding,
 visibility,
 and


support
 for
 startups.
 As
 president,
 he


implemented
 policies
 to
 attract


international
 talent
 like
 the
 French


tech
 visa,
 reformed
 labor
 laws,


introduced
 a
 flat
 tax
 on
 capital
 gains,


and
 encouraged
 institutional
 investment


in
 startups
 through
 initiatives
 such
 as


TB
 and
 the
 54
 billion
 euro
 France
 2030


plan.
 Under
 the
 current
 government,


France
 has
 seen
 a
 dramatic
 increase
 in


venture
 capital
 investment
 and
 the


number
 of
 unicorns,
 meaning
 startups


valued
 at
 $1
 billion
 and
 over,
 growing


from
 just
 a
 handful
 to
 27
 as
 of
 2025.


France
 prioritizes
 public
 private


partnerships
 exemplified
 by
 the
 France


2030
 plan
 and
 the
 choose
 France


investment
 summit
 which
 have
 brought


tens
 of
 billions
 of
 euros
 for
 tech


infrastructure
 especially
 in
 AI
 and
 data


centers.
 France
 has
 been
 actively


promoted
 and
 marketed
 as
 a
 tech
 hub
 on


the
 global
 stage
 hosting
 major
 summits


and
 attracting
 international
 tech
 giants


to
 invest
 in
 French
 R&D
 and


infrastructure.
 So
 say
 what
 you
 will


about
 Macron.
 This
 is
 not
 a
 political


channel
 at
 all
 but
 I
 got
 to
 give
 it
 to


him.
 He
 did
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 things
 for
 the


French
 tech.
 Now,
 let's
 talk
 about
 what


France's
 vision
 2030
 looks
 like.
 For


those
 of
 you
 who
 have
 been
 watching
 my


videos,
 you
 know
 that
 there
 is
 a
 series


of
 these
 projects
 across
 the
 world.
 If


you're
 interested
 in
 comparing
 the
 two,


you're
 welcome
 to
 check
 out
 our
 UAE
 and


Saudi
 Arabia
 episode.
 France's
 vision


2030
 is
 a
 large-scale
 54
 billion
 euro


national
 strategy
 to
 transform
 the


country
 into
 a
 global
 leader
 in


technology.
 It
 was
 launched
 in
 2021
 by


President
 Mccron.
 The
 plan
 targets
 the


lasting
 transformation
 of
 key
 sectors,


energy,
 technology,
 health,
 and


agriculture
 through
 technological


innovation
 and
 research.
 Here
 are
 some


of
 France's
 vision
 2030
 goals.
 Doubling


the
 number
 of
 AI
 specialists,
 making


France
 a
 leader
 in
 embedded
 and


trustworthy
 AI.
 Securing
 the
 supply
 of


critical
 semiconductors,
 establishing
 at


least
 100
 unicorns,
 including
 25
 green


tech
 or
 climate
 tech
 unicorns
 by
 2030.


Now,
 I
 don't
 know if
 that's
 achievable


given
 that
 they're
 at
 27
 in
 2025,
 but


that's
 the
 plan.
 The
 strategy
 also


prioritizes
 reindustrialization,


tech
 skill
 development
 from
 early


education,
 and
 the
 full
 digitalization


of
 250
 essential
 public
 services.
 Now,


let's
 talk
 about
 how
 much
 has
 been


actually
 achieved
 so
 far.
 The
 number
 of


deep
 tech
 startups
 in
 France
 has


increased
 by
 over
 50%
 since
 2019,


reaching
 2500
 by
 2023
 and
 creating
 tens


of
 thousands
 of
 jobs.
 However,
 the
 pace


of
 turning
 scientific
 research
 into


commercial
 innovation
 is
 still
 slower


than
 that
 in
 the
 US
 or
 the
 UK,
 prompting


additional
 investment
 and
 new


initiatives
 to
 double
 annual
 deep
 tech


startup
 creation
 by
 2030.
 The
 French


Tech
 2030
 program
 now
 supports
 125
 high


potential
 startups
 with
 financial
 and


strategic
 resources
 focusing
 on
 sectors


like
 AI,
 quantum,
 semiconductors,
 and


green
 tech.
 Nearly
 half
 of
 the
 France


2030
 budget
 has
 been
 allocated
 to


decarbonization
 and
 green
 industry


projects,
 including
 grants,
 new
 tax


credits,
 and
 streamline
 procedures
 for


industrial
 investments.
 Nevertheless,
 it


is
 worth
 noting
 that
 the
 2025
 budget


reduced
 some
 of
 the
 tax
 breaks
 for
 R&D


intensive
 startups
 and
 cut
 funding
 for


France
 2030
 by
 overâ‚¬2
 billion.
 France


has
 surpassed
 the
 EU
 average
 for
 basic


and
 advanced
 digital
 skill
 and
 is


rolling
 out
 large-scale
 training
 and


upskilling
 programs
 for
 the
 current


workforce
 to
 meet
 AI
 skill
 demand.
 The


skilled
 and
 jobs
 of
 the
 future


initiative
 alone
 hasâ‚¬2.5
 billion
 e


budget
 to
 accelerate
 digital
 and
 R&D


training.
 Quantum
 and
 semiconductor


ambitions.
 France
 has
 committed
 overâ‚¬1


billion
 euros
 in
 public
 funding
 plus


private
 investment
 to
 quantum


technologies
 with
 a
 goal
 to
 produce
 at


least
 two
 quantum
 computer
 prototypes
 by


2030.
 In
 the
 semiconductor
 space,


President
 Mccron
 has
 set
 a
 national


ambition
 to
 manufacture
 advanced
 chips


from
 2
 to
 10
 nanometers
 and
 partnerships


with
 global
 leaders
 like
 Nvidia
 and


others.
 Although
 I
 got
 to
 mention
 that


France
 has
 not
 yet
 produced
 those


cuttingedge
 chips.
 So
 to
 sum
 it
 up,


France
 2030
 has
 already
 led
 to
 a
 surge


in
 deep
 tech
 startups
 and
 significant


investment
 in
 tech
 skills
 and


infrastructure.
 While
 some
 flagship


ambitions
 like
 the
 cutting
 edge
 chip


manufacturing
 and
 quantum
 computing
 are


still
 in
 very
 early
 stages,
 the
 country


has
 made
 measurable
 advances
 and
 remains


on
 track
 for
 most
 of
 its
 2030
 targets.


Cost
 of
 living.
 The
 cost
 of
 living
 in


France's
 major
 tech
 hubs
 Paris,
 Leon,


and
 Tulus
 reflects
 both
 the
 vibrancy
 and


the
 challenges
 of
 the
 innovation


centers.
 Paris
 remains
 the
 most


expensive
 city
 with
 high
 rents,
 daily


expenses,
 and
 a
 premium
 lifestyle.
 They


can
 stretch
 even
 generous
 tax
 salaries.


Leong
 and
 Tulus,
 while
 still
 offering


tech
 scenes
 and
 career
 opportunities
 in


tech,
 are
 noticeably
 more
 affordable,


but
 the
 salaries
 are
 obviously
 lower
 as


well.
 Over
 the
 past
 5
 years,
 living


costs
 have
 gradually
 increased
 in
 all


major
 cities,
 but
 the
 difference
 between


Paris
 and
 the
 regional
 hubs
 has
 become


even
 more
 pronounced.
 As
 a
 result,
 many


tech
 workers
 and
 companies
 are


increasingly
 drawn
 to
 cities
 like
 Leong


and
 Tulus
 with
 balance
 between
 career


prospects
 and
 quality
 of
 life.
 Knowing


that
 the
 cost
 of
 living
 is
 less
 likely


to
 erode
 the
 benefits
 of
 a
 competitive


salary.
 France
 has
 pulled
 off
 something


that
 nobody
 thought
 it
 would.
 A
 country


notorious
 for
 bureaucracy
 has
 become


Europe's
 AI
 battleground.
 While
 rigid


labor
 laws
 were
 supposed
 to
 kill


innovation,
 they
 actually
 created


stability
 that
 attracted
 billions
 in


long-term
 investments.
 Nuclear
 power
 has


become
 the
 ultimate
 competitive


advantage
 in
 the
 age
 of
 energy
 hungry


AI.
 But
 this
 success
 story
 comes
 with
 an


expiration
 date.
 France's
 uranium


pipeline
 from
 Niger
 is
 severed.
 Chinese


and
 Russian
 influence
 is
 spreading


across
 their
 former
 colonies.
 And
 those


56
 nuclear
 reactors
 need
 massive


constant
 maintenance,
 costly
 repairs
 and


significant
 reinvestment.
 The
 very


foundation
 of
 France's
 tech
 advantage
 is


built
 on
 shifting
 geopolitical
 sands.
 So


the
 question
 is
 whether
 France
 can


sustain
 this
 energy
 momentum
 because
 in


the
 world
 where
 AI
 runs
 on
 electricity,


the
 country
 that
 solves
 the
 energy


equation
 wins
 everything.


Before
 we
 wrap
 up,
 I
 would
 like
 to
 say


thank
 you
 to
 all
 of
 you
 who
 joined
 us
 on


this
 journey
 across
 10
 countries,
 10


very
 different
 ecosystems,
 and
 10
 very


different
 paths
 forward.
 The
 tech
 world


is
 changing
 faster
 than
 ever,
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 continue
 researching
 and


studying
 the
 tech
 world
 we
 have
 been


dealt.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 your


feedback,
 for
 your
 support.
 And
 while


this
 series
 is
 wrapping
 up,
 we
 will
 be


back
 very
 soon
 with
 a
 new
 series
 of


videos
 dedicated
 to
 AIdriven
 shifts
 in


the
 tech
 ecosystem.
 We
 will
 draw
 a
 very


clear
 line
 between
 what's
 noise
 and


what's
 reality
 and
 when
 panic
 overtakes


logic.
 Please
 stay
 with
 us.
 We
 will
 be


back
 very
 soon.
 We
 will
 take
 a
 quick


break
 next
 week
 celebrating
 Canada
 Day


and
 July
 4th.
 So,
 to
 all
 of
 our


subscribers
 in
 Canada
 and
 in
 the
 US,


happy
 Canada
 Day
 and
 happy
 4th
 of
 July.


As
 always,
 I
 hope
 this
 was
 helpful.


We'll
 see
 you
 next
 time.
