[Music]


hi
 everybody
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 of
 the


Norwegian
 so
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today
 we


are
 hosting
 an
 investor
 Legend
 poll


singer
 who
 founded
 Elliot
 asset


management
 and
 probably
 the
 most


important
 activist
 investor
 in
 the
 world


PA
 warm
 welcome
 thank
 you
 what
 is


activist
 investing
 activist
 investing
 is


taking
 a
 position
 largely
 in
 an
 equity


security
 of
 a
 company
 um
 and
 trying
 to


um
 engage
 with
 the
 company
 to
 uh
 improve


outcomes
 control
 or
 influence
 outcomes


better
 outcomes
 um
 to
 unlock
 value
 it


could
 be
 uh
 it
 could
 be
 U
 management


changes
 that
 are
 requested
 it
 could
 be
 U


capital
 structure
 changes
 uh
 Finance
 um


strategies
 and
 tactics
 um
 uh
 anything


that
 will
 U
 make
 the
 company
 uh
 earn


more
 money
 be
 better
 better
 positioned


more
 ra
 uh
 uh
 rationally
 deploy
 assets


why
 do
 you
 have
 to
 do
 this
 don't


companies
 do
 this
 themselves
 well
 as
 you


know
 the
 U
 uh
 Trend
 away
 from
 active


investing
 and
 by
 active
 investing
 I


don't
 necessarily
 mean
 activist
 active


investing
 just
 means
 um
 you
 open
 the


mail
 from
 the
 company
 that
 you
 in
 which


you
 invest
 you
 try
 to
 figure
 it
 out
 you


try
 to
 uh
 understand
 the
 company


strategy
 and
 maybe
 you'll
 call
 the


company
 up
 and
 L
 in
 some
 suggestions
 but


U
 active
 investing
 is
 next
 to
 passive


investing
 or
 index
 investing
 index


investing
 now
 accounts
 for
 a
 plurality


of
 money
 uh
 money
 that's
 managed


particularly
 Equity
 money
 uh
 around
 the


um
 around
 the
 world
 what
 kind
 of
 steps


do
 you
 take
 some
 of
 the
 steps
 are
 very


um
 um
 praic
 we
 develop
 ideas
 from
 a


variety
 of
 sources
 given
 our
 position
 in


the
 marketplace
 um
 sometimes
 uh
 people


bring
 us
 ideas
 uh
 sometimes
 the
 street


brings
 us
 ideas
 um
 uh
 sometimes
 we
 faret


out
 ideas
 ourselves
 U
 the
 first
 thing
 we


do
 is
 in
 an
 IT
 iterative
 process
 um
 we


develop
 a
 set
 of
 questions
 different


from
 every
 uh
 in
 every
 industry
 and
 run


down
 the
 questions
 uh
 we
 talk
 to
 a
 lot


of
 people
 former
 employees
 uh
 uh


customers
 uh
 Wall
 Street
 analysts
 um
 uh


a
 consequence
 parenthetically
 of
 uh
 the


trend
 towards
 index
 investing
 is
 that


there's
 less
 coverage
 research
 coverage


from
 Wall
 Street
 and
 when
 I
 say
 Wall


Street
 I
 mean
 the
 global
 U
 uh
 uh


Investment
 Banking
 firms
 uh
 in
 firms


that
 Supply
 research
 but
 we
 try
 to


become
 as
 as
 informed
 as
 possible
 we
 try


to


ascertain
 the
 uh
 local
 um
 uh
 landscape


in
 terms
 of
 culture
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 the


culture
 of
 capitalism
 uh
 and
 U
 the


culture
 of
 corporate
 uh
 control


corporate
 change
 um
 we
 try
 to
 understand


the
 board
 of
 directors
 and
 the


management
 how
 do
 how
 how
 they
 got
 there


um
 um
 what
 their
 strategies
 are
 what
 why


they're


failing
 um
 I
 mean
 we
 don't
 get
 involved


with
 highly
 successful
 companies
 that


can't
 be
 improved
 really
 so
 what
 is
 your


perfect
 what's
 your
 perfect
 situation


the
 perfect
 situation
 is
 a
 u


company
 and
 this
 exists
 um
 you
 may
 be


surprised
 to
 hear
 it
 but
 uh
 it
 exists
 a


company
 which
 has
 an
 open
 door
 and
 by


Open
 Door
 what
 I
 mean
 is
 something's


been
 going
 on
 for
 a
 long


time
 um
 uh
 the
 founder
 or
 one
 generation


from
 the
 founder
 um
 feels
 a
 u
 a
 moral


obligation
 to
 um
 the
 local
 shareholders


or
 the
 uh
 the
 original
 shareholders
 or


the
 family
 doesn't
 want
 to
 give
 up


doesn't
 want
 to
 give
 up
 the
 longstanding


strategy
 or
 Corp
 uh
 capital
 structure
 or


alignment
 or
 location
 of
 headquarters
 um


uh
 any
 one
 of
 a
 number
 of
 uh
 reasons
 why


when
 we
 come


knocking
 um
 we
 not
 infrequently
 find
 a


what
 we
 what
 I
 am
 accurately
 calling
 a


an
 open
 door
 and
 in
 an
 open
 door
 it's
 a


different
 discussion
 but
 if
 we're
 right


I
 mean
 we're
 we're
 not
 always
 right
 of


course
 on
 on
 the
 details
 of
 our


strategies
 and
 sometimes
 we're
 just


plain
 wrong
 um
 but
 um
 if
 we're
 right
 and


there's
 um
 a
 segment
 an
 important


segment
 of
 the
 uh
 the
 um
 leadership
 the


board
 of
 directors
 the
 management
 um
 who


actually
 agree
 with
 that
 then
 it's
 a


then
 it's
 a
 u
 fairly
 smooth
 path
 to
 um


getting
 things
 done
 how
 many
 smooth
 ones


do
 you
 have
 for
 for
 the
 ones
 who
 are
 not


so
 smooth
 I
 mean
 generally
 speaking
 how


do
 companies
 react
 when
 pulsing
 or


knocks
 on
 the
 door
 yeah
 yeah
 it's
 a
 very


interesting
 question
 because
 um
 one


thing
 that
 is
 um
 that
 is
 just
 crystal


clear
 and
 um
 and
 endemic
 hardly
 anyone


tries
 to
 stiff
 arm
 us
 hardly
 anyone


there's
 the
 occasional
 and
 there's
 a


playbook
 for
 that
 you
 know
 we
 have
 one


firm
 One
 Fund
 and
 it's
 large
 yeah
 uh
 and


we
 obvious
 like
 $70
 billion
 like
 72


right
 now
 72
 billion
 um
 and
 we
 have
 the


wherewithal
 to
 to
 back
 our
 uh
 thesis
 and


pursue
 our
 approach
 um
 so
 everyone


almost
 everyone
 sorry
 picks
 up
 the
 phone


the
 advisers
 all
 tell
 them
 Elliot
 you


should
 pick
 up
 the
 phone
 you
 should


engage
 with
 these
 people
 um
 they're
 deal


makers
 we're
 dealmakers
 um
 uh
 uh
 and
 you


will
 hear
 them
 out
 um
 and
 they
 do
 and
 so


some
 of
 the
 approaches
 are
 under
 the


radar
 screen
 some
 of
 the
 approaches
 um


we
 will
 file
 a
 disclose
 a
 position
 uh


others
 we
 don't
 disclose
 to
 the
 public


um
 we
 disclose
 to
 the
 to
 the
 company


that
 we
 have
 a
 position
 um
 it
 depends
 on


the
 rules
 uh
 it
 depends
 on
 what
 what
 our


strategy
 might
 be
 but
 um
 a
 a
 discussion


a
 detailed
 discussion
 of
 and
 and
 a
 deck


um
 my
 guys
 like
 writing
 decks
 like
 piles


of
 paper
 large
 piles
 of
 paper
 yeah
 with


uh
 graphs
 and
 terrible
 what
 does
 it
 mean


to
 be
 a
 dealmaker
 well
 in
 other
 words


we're
 not
 we're
 not
 Crusaders
 we're
 not


we're
 not
 just
 speaking
 to
 hear


ourselves
 speak
 we're
 not
 um
 engaged
 to


read
 about
 ourselves
 in
 the
 Ft
 tomorrow


morning
 um
 we
 have
 a
 we
 have
 a
 goal
 we


have
 a
 thesis
 if
 our
 thesis
 is
 right
 and


the
 company
 takes
 steps
 which
 is
 not


always
 um
 I
 would
 say
 getting
 all
 of
 our


requests


is
 not
 rare
 but
 it's


not
 dominant
 as
 the
 dominant
 outcome
 but


um
 we're
 generally
 pretty
 right
 and
 uh


uh
 and
 um
 the
 things
 we
 suggest


generally
 are
 creative
 to
 u
 to
 value
 and


so
 the
 company
 that
 engages
 with
 us
 it's


a
 minority
 of
 those
 companies
 um
 which


stiff
 arm
 us
 and
 knock
 down
 drag
 out


proxy


fights
 or
 lengthy
 litigations
 doesn't


really
 help
 anybody
 but
 sometimes
 it


happens
 what's
 the
 ratio
 of
 of
 success


successful
 outcomes
 versus
 not
 so


successful
 outcomes
 well
 since
 I'm
 going


to
 Define
 successful
 as
 um
 we
 get
 a


meaningful
 percentage
 of
 what
 we
 asked


for
 and
 the
 stock
 reflects
 it
 not
 just


in
 20
 minutes
 but
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 over
 a


period
 of
 time
 that
 we
 actually
 our


ideas
 actually
 add
 value
 yeah
 it's
 the


only
 way
 we
 can
 maintain
 our
 reputation


that
 gets
 the
 stock
 to
 to
 say
 oh


Elliot's
 in
 this
 here's
 their
 the
 is


nobody
 else
 has
 been
 able
 to
 unlock
 that


key
 the
 stock
 is
 worth
 more
 and
 of


course
 um
 it's
 it's
 not
 a
 question
 of


short-termism


because
 um
 actual
 short-termism
 doesn't


add
 value
 to
 anyone
 really
 um
 but
 um


it's
 it's
 not
 short-termism
 when
 the


market
 instantly
 overnight
 or
 in
 a


couple
 of
 days
 or
 a
 few
 days
 understands


that
 you
 are
 adding
 long-term
 value
 yeah


you're
 you're
 adding
 Enterprise
 Value


the
 strategy
 is
 better
 your
 ability
 to


compete
 is
 better
 and
 in
 in
 What


proportion
 of
 the
 cases
 do
 you
 think
 you


are
 adding
 value
 if
 you
 measure
 it
 in


that
 way
 well
 the
 proportion
 of
 cases
 in


which
 we're
 adding
 value
 is
 I
 believe


close
 to
 100
 the
 proportion
 of
 cases
 in


which
 it's
 reflected
 in
 uh
 action


movement
 of
 structure
 capital
 structure


uh
 Etc
 uh
 me
 directors
 um


is


probably
 this
 is
 just
 a


guess
 but
 it's
 a
 majority
 it's
 like
 70%


right
 something
 something
 like
 that
 it's


not
 90
 it's
 not
 80
 I
 think
 so
 for


instance
 last
 year


you
 uh
 took
 action
 against
 Starbucks
 I


don't
 want
 to
 be
 a
 word
 Smith
 here
 okay


let's
 let's
 phrase
 it
 differently
 you


didn't
 take
 but
 it's
 important
 because


you
 made
 an
 investment
 in
 Starbucks
 it's


important
 to
 to
 to
 at
 least
 get
 this


right
 in
 our
 minds
 uh
 because
 um
 the


street
 sorry
 the
 media
 loves
 battle
 and


they
 love
 to
 take
 down
 successful
 uh


investors
 rich
 people
 whatever
 um
 so
 the


colorful
 way
 that
 it's
 generally
 um
 um


framed
 is
 attack
 okay
 but
 let's
 cycle


back
 to
 near
 the
 beginning
 of
 our


conversation
 this
 morning
 fewer
 and


fewer
 literally
 fewer
 and
 fewer
 people


are
 um


acting
 like
 owners
 yeah
 and
 fewer
 and


fewer
 companies
 are
 accepting
 the
 notion


that
 the
 owners
 have
 anything
 to
 say
 um


to
 to
 the
 management
 and
 the
 board
 it's


it's
 kind
 of
 shocking
 and
 therefore
 we


are


among
 with
 with
 certainly
 in
 terms
 of


numbers
 among
 the
 very
 a
 short
 list
 of


people
 who
 do
 call
 uh
 for


accountability
 so
 we
 and
 when
 we
 win
 um


the
 shareholders
 win
 the
 the
 days
 of


green
 mail
 are
 uh
 longer
 so
 you
 so
 you


make
 an
 investment
 in


Starbucks
 and
 you
 initiated
 an
 um
 a


change
 in
 strategy
 right
 so
 they
 changed


the
 CEO
 uh
 change
 strategy
 and
 you
 made


uh
 you
 made
 money
 do
 you
 think
 you're


doing
 do
 you
 think
 you're
 making
 Society


a
 better
 place
 it's
 not
 the
 um
 um
 I
 mean


I
 have
 a
 variety
 of
 political
 and


philosophical
 and
 philanthropic
 uh


outlets
 for
 my
 um
 uh


compensation
 um
 but
 um
 and
 I
 do


think
 we
 do
 make
 the
 world
 a
 better


place
 not
 in
 every
 single
 situation
 but


um
 um
 this
 style
 of


investing
 um
 is
 uh
 it
 enhances
 the


possibility
 and
 the
 probability
 that


enterprises


can


Service
 uh
 their
 their
 customers


competition
 is
 good
 having
 multiple


Outlets
 is
 uh
 uh
 is
 um
 useful
 we
 happen


to
 I
 mean
 I'll
 tell
 you
 the
 most
 basic


answer
 to
 your
 question
 there
 are
 layers


of
 answer
 um
 uh
 to
 your
 question
 but
 at


the
 most
 basic
 level
 we
 have
 like
 a


hundred
 universities
 we
 have
 hospitals


we
 have
 um
 U
 charity
 charitable


trusts
 and
 among
 the
 um
 uh
 among
 the


elements
 of
 what
 I
 just
 uh
 told
 you
 is


um
 because
 of


our
 we
 we're
 not
 a
 an
 activist
 fund
 and


everything
 else
 is
 uh
 is
 window
 dressing


we
 are
 an
 absolute
 return
 fund
 which


means
 that
 you
 want
 to
 make
 money


whatever
 the
 market
 does
 right
 and
 so


what
 the
 meaning
 of
 that
 to
 your
 La


latest
 question
 is
 um
 uh
 in
 the


infrequent
 and
 now
 a
 distant
 memory
 um


uh
 in
 the
 infrequent
 so
 seriously


adverse
 uh
 uh
 Financial
 Market


environments
 these
 people
 have
 very
 few


investment
 Outlets
 that
 actually
 perform


on
 that
 sometimes
 things
 don't
 go
 your


way
 right
 what
 are
 the
 characteristics


of
 the
 Investments
 which
 don't
 go
 the


way
 you
 want
 do
 they
 have
 something
 in


common
 sometimes
 it's
 bad
 luck
 uh
 but
 um


um
 more
 frequently
 it's
 we
 missed


something
 we


missed
 uh
 or
 or
 the
 hedges
 weren't
 um


they
 weren't
 the
 right
 Hedges
 they
 the


track
 the
 tracking
 era
 was
 much
 more


than
 we
 uhu
 uh
 than
 we
 uh
 expected
 at


the
 beginning
 of
 my
 career
 77
 1977
 to


like


1987
 um
 uh
 hedging
 was
 much
 more
 simple


um
 because
 we
 were
 long
 a
 convertible


Bond
 and
 short
 the
 stock
 into
 which
 the


convertible
 was
 convertible
 um
 so
 that's


that's
 very
 straightforward
 um
 um
 and
 um


tracking
 error
 wasn't
 really
 a


u
 a
 factor
 um
 we've
 become
 um
 much
 more


sophisticated
 in
 uh
 hedging
 in
 creating


bespoke
 Hedges
 uh
 for
 different
 kinds
 of


uh
 different
 kinds
 of
 Trades
 um
 uh
 uh


and
 but
 even
 those
 don't
 U
 don't
 work


out
 uh
 exactly
 U
 you
 know
 all
 the
 time


um
 but
 sometimes
 you
 know
 the
 the
 worst


trades
 uh
 and
 I
 don't
 mind
 um
 mentioning


them
 it's
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 form
 of
 therapy


and
 pedagogical
 exercise
 the
 worst


trades
 are
 the
 trades
 that
 you
 U


misunderstand
 the
 risk
 you
 you
 put
 it


into
 the
 wrong
 category
 I'll
 give
 you


two
 brief
 examples
 um
 one
 moderately


horrifying
 and
 the


other
 done
 really
 really
 bad
 um
 the
 one


that's
 moderately
 horrifying
 is
 um
 a
 uh


a
 peer
 who
 will
 remain
 nameless
 um
 sold


us
 a
 late
 stage
 bankruptcy
 in
 a
 deinking


plant
 somewhere
 in
 the
 northern
 United


States
 late
 stage
 denotes
 the
 ri
 discs


are
 Mo
 mostly
 gone
 in
 a
 complicated


workout
 bankruptcy
 process
 um
 uh
 and
 the


deinking
 was
 their
 business
 you
 know


waste
 paper
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 deink
 it


and
 use
 it
 again
 and
 that's
 good
 for
 the


environment
 it's
 good
 for
 the
 human
 race


it's
 good
 for
 the
 Galaxy
 suffices
 to
 say


that
 it
 wasn't
 late
 stage
 there
 were


important
 bankruptcy
 elements
 that


hadn't
 been
 settled
 and
 the
 deinking


plant
 didn't
 really
 work


so
 aside
 from
 hating
 the
 person
 that


sold
 it
 to
 me
 um
 um
 that's
 just
 it's


just
 a
 just
 a
 mistake
 um
 and
 we
 lost
 it


wasn't
 that
 big
 a
 position
 but
 we
 were


much
 smaller
 um
 and
 the
 really
 bad
 one


which
 was
 that
 that
 was
 an
 Arbitrage


position
 in


Japanese
 index
 link
 bonds
 inflation
 link


bonds
 now
 this
 Arbitrage
 was
 perfect


um
 jgbs
 Japanese
 government
 bonds
 full


faith
 in
 credit
 um
 uh


against
 jgbs
 that
 had
 the
 as
 I
 recall


the
 um
 the
 principal
 amount
 adjusted
 for


actual
 CPI
 uh
 uh


movements
 the
 Japanese
 CPI
 Consumer


Price
 Index
 um
 never
 moved
 much
 it
 it


was
 bouncing
 around
 zero
 for
 decades
 U


Back
 Then
 we're
 talking
 about


20078
 2006
 78
 um
 be
 hardly
 ever
 dipped


tiny
 bit
 below
 zero
 for
 a
 month
 or


something
 but
 it
 was
 running
 plus
 a


little
 okay
 when
 we
 got
 involved
 in
 that


horrible
 trade
 a
 dealer
 showed
 it
 to
 us


and
 the
 dealer
 had
 several
 other
 people


um
 in
 the
 trade
 um
 the
 price


was
 minus
 2%
 inflation
 per
 year
 for
 7


years
 minus


2%
 it's
 the
 kind
 of
 thing
 where
 you
 look


around
 the
 trading
 room
 and
 ship
 it
 in


right
 okay


so
 to
 make
 a
 long
 story
 short
 a
 long


painful
 story
 short
 that
 thing
 went
 from


and
 implied
 in
 the
 prices
 um
 minus
 2%


per
 year
 at
 the
 worst
 minus
 4
 and
 a


half%
 per
 year
 to
 to
 make
 this
 very
 very


uh
 straightforward
 in
 terms
 of


arithmetic
 the
 jgb
 uh
 I
 the
 inflation


Linker
 went
 down
 30%
 in
 price
 MH
 that


that
 trip
 to


where
 we
 still
 held
 it
 we


lost
 Gob
 of
 money
 um
 and
 it
 was
 going
 to


mature
 just
 six
 years
 or
 so
 in
 the


future
 but
 we
 had
 lost
 like
 30%
 of
 the


of
 the
 principle
 and
 it's
 these
 things


are
 Mark
 to
 Market
 every
 day
 um


so
 that
 calls
 to
 um
 CA
 to
 um
 action
 uh
 a


different


um
 um
 a
 different
 set
 of
 skills
 for


money
 managers
 a
 number
 of
 people
 were


sold
 out
 of
 that
 position
 because
 when


you
 misunderstand
 the
 risk
 and
 lever


something
 up
 that
 you
 never
 should
 have


levered
 up
 that
 way
 because
 you


misunderstood
 the
 C
 the
 essential


characteristic
 um
 you
 can
 have


devastating
 losses
 we


I
 I
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 pressure
 to
 onewind
 the


trade
 but
 I
 kept
 the
 trade
 and
 it's
 just


it
 was
 in
 '
 08
 there
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 you


know
 do
 or
 die
 positions
 back
 uh
 back


then
 yeah
 tell
 me
 about
 about
 it
 I
 was


there
 why
 is
 it
 so
 important
 for
 you
 not


to
 lose
 money
 where
 does
 the
 risk


aversion
 come
 from
 it's
 a
 great
 question


um
 Elliot
 was
 formed
 in


77
 when
 I
 was


accepted
 after
 college
 to
 Harvard
 Law


School
 the
 greatest
 moment
 of
 my
 Dad's


life
 um
 he
 was
 a
 retail
 pharmacist
 a


chemist
 and
 he
 was
 sure
 I
 was
 going
 to


be
 some
 really
 big
 shot
 and
 he
 was
 sure


that
 I
 had
 to
 um
 learn
 how
 to
 invest


because
 I
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 financial


Big
 Shot
 um
 I
 was
 a
 Psychology
 major
 in


college
 and
 I
 had
 no
 idea
 why
 I
 was


going
 to
 law
 school
 but
 Harvard
 Law


School
 was
 sounds
 good
 might
 as
 well
 and


I
 think
 my
 psychology
 background


titilated
 the
 um
 admissions
 committee
 um


and
 so
 the
 way
 my
 father
 and
 I
 dealt


with
 my
 training
 was
 and
 retail


pharmacist
 he's
 he's
 in
 the
 drugstore


every
 day
 12
 hours
 a
 day
 we
 traded


speculative
 mining
 stocks
 and
 tech


stocks
 and
 I
 promise
 you
 you
 could
 not


name
 a
 way
 to
 lose
 money
 the
 dad
 and
 I


did
 not
 hone
 to
 the
 finest
 uh
 uh
 Edge


Short
 Selling
 long
 puts
 short
 calls
 uh
 I


was
 an
 early
 adopter
 of
 uh
 the
 CBO
 uh


CBOE
 um
 the
 options
 Exchange


um
 and
 that
 culminated
 in
 a
 catastrophic


loss
 in
 the
 74
 bar


Market
 um
 where
 I
 was
 long
 stocks
 that
 I


was
 certain
 because
 of
 my
 intellect
 uh


i'
 done
 the


research
 um
 I
 certain
 they
 would
 go
 up


and
 I
 held
 them
 on


margin
 um
 at
 one
 point
 and
 I'm
 talking


about
 $50,000
 for
 my


mom's
 special
 Dash
 in
 the
 bottom
 of
 the


dress
 dresser
 draw
 drawers
 um
 uh
 at
 one


point
 it
 was
 down


88%
 88%
 um
 so
 um
 my
 desire
 never
 to
 lose


money
 again
 was
 a
 combination
 of
 wanting


to
 get
 my
 mother's
 my
 parents'
 money


back
 um
 and
 and
 the
 feeling
 of
 uh


real
 Devastation
 I
 mean
 losing
 B
 and
 my


best
 friend's
 the
 $10,000
 and


$20,000
 um
 so
 when
 we
 formed
 Elliot
 with


when
 I
 realized
 that
 I
 could
 manage


money
 and
 make
 money
 all
 the
 time
 the


convertible
 hedging
 was
 was
 a
 a
 very


good
 strategy
 very


under
 underserviced
 uh
 you
 know
 High


standstill
 rate
 of
 return
 um
 no
 real
 no


really
 good
 uh
 valuation
 models
 um
 it


was
 all
 on
 the
 Fly
 and
 all
 relationships


with
 the
 street
 and
 along
 the
 way
 so


what
 I
 just
 said
 is
 not
 the
 full
 answer


to
 your
 question
 along
 the
 way
 what
 I


observed
 was
 that
 when
 people
 have


losses
 meaningful
 losses
 they
 tend
 to


lose
 their
 minds
 they
 tend
 to
 lose
 their


judgments
 their
 sloppiness
 in
 accepting


the
 state
 of
 play
 of
 the
 world
 when
 the


skies
 are
 blue
 um
 turns
 into
 a
 clutching


darkness
 when
 uh
 when
 the
 headlines
 and


the
 stories
 and
 the
 and
 their
 friends
 uh


uh
 are
 uh
 in
 trouble
 and
 suffering


terrible
 losses
 and
 so
 I
 knew
 that


judgment
 is
 impaired
 um
 I
 also
 knew
 that


if
 you
 could
 keep
 your
 not
 only
 your


head
 and
 your
 judgment
 intact
 but
 your


Capital
 intact
 these
 rare


periods
 of
 time
 when
 there
 are
 special


opportunities
 I
 mean
 those
 last
 few


weeks
 in
 '


08
 um
 unbelievable
 just
 they
 everything


got
 cheap
 and
 then
 they
 collapsed
 I
 mean


serious
 go
 back
 and
 look
 at
 it
 go
 back


and
 look
 at
 it
 so
 if
 you
 had
 the
 the
 the


Constitutional
 as
 well
 as
 uh
 as
 well
 as


um
 um
 ability
 by
 permission
 as
 well
 as


the
 um
 Capital
 the
 exess
 capital
 um
 to


take
 advantage
 of
 those
 uh


opportunities
 that's
 a
 pretty
 cool
 thing


to
 do
 so
 if
 you
 don't
 lose
 large
 amounts


of
 money
 so
 the
 capital
 is
 like
 a


ratchet
 effect
 you
 make
 a
 buck
 you
 keep


it
 you
 try
 to
 make
 another
 one
 my


clients
 never
 held
 me
 to
 a
 benchmark


obviously
 you
 have
 to
 make
 some
 money
 um


um
 um
 the
 the
 Brilliance
 of
 our
 approach


um
 uh
 uh
 is


that
 we
 don't


Benchmark


ourselves
 it's
 it's
 what
 I
 just
 told
 you


it's
 don't
 lose
 money
 and
 whatever's


left
 hopefully
 it's
 a
 rate
 of
 return


it's
 interesting
 how
 formative
 it
 is
 if


you
 lose
 money
 early
 on
 in
 your
 career
 I


mean
 as
 Steven
 schwarzman
 talks
 about


the
 same
 thing
 right
 how
 you
 lose
 I


don't
 know
 his
 story
 your
 client's
 money


early
 on
 and
 you
 just
 decide
 you're


never
 going
 to
 do
 it


again
 um
 you
 talked
 about
 your
 father


are
 you
 still
 trying
 to
 make
 your
 father


proud
 I
 appreciate
 he
 probably
 is
 not


alive
 anymore
 but
 you
 know
 he
 was
 proud


of
 me
 no
 matter
 what
 to
 be
 perfectly


candid
 about
 it
 um
 no
 I'm
 not
 doing
 it


to
 make
 my
 father
 proud
 I
 U
 I
 keep
 doing


it
 because
 it
 um
 I
 think
 we
 do
 it
 well


and
 is
 it
 fun
 are
 you
 having
 fun
 no


you're
 not
 having
 fun
 you
 don't
 think


it's
 fun
 oh
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 fun
 I


think
 skiing
 is
 fun
 snowmobile
 dealing


is
 great
 fun
 sailing
 is
 fun
 why
 do
 you


why
 do
 you
 are
 you
 80
 you're
 80
 but
 what


and
 so
 if
 you
 don't
 think
 it's
 fun
 why


why
 you're
 8
 years
 old
 why
 why
 you


you've
 done
 it
 for
 50
 years
 you're
 one


of
 the
 most
 successful
 people
 ever
 why


why
 do
 you
 continue
 to
 do
 it
 if
 you


don't
 think
 it's
 fun
 I
 get
 this
 question


I
 get
 this
 question
 and
 the
 reason
 I


basically
 this
 is
 a
 little
 different


this
 format
 but
 the
 reason
 I
 basically


get
 this
 question
 is
 that
 I
 dig
 in


I'm
 enthusiastic
 about
 it
 I
 get
 into
 it


it
 can't
 be
 boring
 if
 you
 think
 about


what
 you
 read
 about
 in
 the
 newspaper


which
 is
 largely
 distorted
 pathetically


um
 so
 wow
 they're
 doing
 all
 kinds
 of


different
 things
 there's
 no
 cookie


cutter
 thing
 at
 Elliot
 so
 there's


challenges
 and
 sometimes
 it's
 it's
 uh


you
 know
 we
 never
 have
 a
 a
 position


profit
 celebration
 never
 you
 never


celebrate


success
 no
 I
 mean
 we
 you
 know
 hey
 well


done
 in
 an
 email
 but
 no
 cake
 no


champagne
 no
 cake
 no
 champagne
 no
 no
 no


no
 um
 but
 um
 what
 I
 what
 I
 want
 to
 say


on
 this
 topic
 of
 fun
 is
 you
 can't
 get


bored
 by
 not
 losing
 serious
 money
 um
 the


reason
 for


Burnout
 is
 sharply
 diminished
 you
 know


that's
 what
 happens
 I
 mean
 it's
 not
 just


horrible
 divorce
 or
 terrible
 tragedy
 in


the
 family
 it's
 you
 know
 burnout
 is
 you


know
 I
 think
 largely
 um
 people
 just
 are


drained
 of
 emotional


energy
 by
 by
 adversity
 because
 and
 you


can't
 predict
 markets
 so
 that's
 that's


another
 a
 dominant
 uh
 cause
 of
 me


seeking
 never
 to
 lose
 money
 because
 if
 I


want
 to
 be
 risk
 averse
 I
 have
 to
 be
 risk


averse
 all
 the
 time
 what
 does
 age
 and


experience
 bring
 to
 to
 your
 investment


process
 in
 our
 lines
 of
 business
 if


someone
 is
 not
 burnt
 out
 or
 bored


or
 fading
 in
 terms
 of


capacity
 the
 experience
 and
 wisdom
 is
 so


so
 needed
 um
 the
 in
 today's
 world


especially
 um
 the
 the
 layer
 of


understanding
 Beyond


um
 the


spreadsheet
 and
 the
 horrible
 lawyers


telling
 you
 you
 have
 a
 95%
 chance
 of


winning
 that
 antitrust
 suit
 and
 then
 you


lose
 and
 you
 get
 dark
 and
 hostile


thoughts
 to
 all
 of
 your
 advisers
 um
 um


so
 it's


that
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 don't
 like
 this
 one


why
 Paul
 why
 uh
 just
 don't
 like
 it


talking
 of
 which
 you
 also
 uh
 took
 on


Argentina
 what
 what
 happened
 there


Argentina
 somewhere
 in
 the
 late
 90s
 um


early


oos
 um
 the
 debt
 started
 trading
 down
 um


into
 the
 uh
 uh
 80s
 and
 then
 70s
 it
 was


still
 paying
 um
 and
 many
 people
 thought


that
 they
 would
 go
 U
 default
 and
 uh
 we


didn't
 we
 didn't
 uh
 we
 knew
 that
 they


had
 a
 history
 of
 default
 um
 three
 four


times
 in
 150
 years
 we
 also
 knew
 that


they
 were
 coming
 out
 of
 World
 War
 II
 I


think
 the
 seventh
 maybe
 the


eighth
 largest
 economy
 in
 the
 world
 so


you
 know
 lots
 of
 resources
 lots
 of


capacity
 we
 didn't
 think
 it
 was
 a
 good


idea
 and
 we
 didn't
 think
 they
 would
 uh


default
 they
 defaulted
 and
 the
 bonds
 U


and
 we
 bought
 performing
 bonds
 the
 bonds


started


collapsing
 um
 and
 it
 was
 a
 long
 time
 I
 I


don't
 remember
 the
 exact
 time
 it
 was
 a


long
 time
 before
 they
 um
 um
 gave
 their


first
 offer
 okay
 now
 Sovereign


restructurings
 come
 in
 different


flavors
 and
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 oversimplify


but
 I
 think
 my
 categories
 are
 broadly


right
 um
 there's
 a
 category
 of


countries
 that
 um
 have
 nothing
 and


you're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 anything
 and


you're
 just
 being
 annoying
 by


um
 going
 after
 them
 so
 Argentina
 is
 a


real
 country
 and
 after
 some
 period
 of


time
 I
 think
 it
 was
 in
 years
 um
 an


extraordinary
 an
 extraordinary
 period
 of


time
 for
 a
 sovereign


restructuring
 they
 came
 in
 with
 a
 29


Cent
 deal
 well
 maybe
 it
 was
 30
 30
 cents


now
 a
 30
 Cent
 recovery
 deal
 for


Sovereign


restructuring
 is
 a


number
 that
 might
 be
 appropriate
 for
 a


Guatemala
 or
 a
 Honduras
 or
 something


Ecuador
 I
 don't
 know
 but
 Argentina
 um


25%
 of
 the
 holders
 and
 the
 the
 bonds


kept
 the
 debt
 kept
 plunging
 uh
 25%
 of


the
 holders
 held
 out
 the
 country
 said
 um


if
 you
 don't
 um
 if
 you
 don't
 um
 uh


accept
 this
 offer
 you
 get
 nothing
 so


they
 got
 a
 few
 perc
 more
 in
 a
 second
 try


at
 the
 the
 same


offer
 like
 three
 years


later
 um
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 those
 two


offers
 there
 were
 like
 60,000
 Bond


holders
 including
 like
 five
 hedge
 funds


of
 which
 Elliot
 was
 the
 largest
 and
 by


that
 time
 our
 basis
 was
 down
 down
 into


the
 I
 don't
 know
 teens
 or
 20s
 whatever


30s
 I
 don't
 know
 um
 um
 it
 it
 had
 kept


trading
 down
 and
 down
 and
 down
 um
 uh
 and


it
 was
 just
 in
 litigation
 for
 how
 long


time
 did
 this
 take
 this
 thing
 take
 you


15
 years
 15
 years
 well
 that's
 pretty
 um


that's
 pretty
 patient
 I
 would
 argue
 no


it's
 not
 patient
 I
 tell
 you
 why
 they


never
 accepted
 our


offer
 to
 negotiate
 with
 them
 they
 never


put
 a
 deal
 on
 the
 table
 um
 uh
 never
 sat


down
 with
 us
 um
 they
 were
 they
 were
 an


example
 and
 there
 have
 been
 some
 in
 the


corporate
 area
 um
 they
 were
 an
 example


of
 just


stubborn
 um
 Hoy
 um
 entitled
 I
 mean
 the


nerve
 of
 us
 no
 but
 I
 love
 the
 fact
 that


you
 don't
 think
 he's
 patient
 because
 I'm


58
 I
 make
 an
 investment
 I
 hope
 I'm
 going


to
 get
 return
 before
 I'm
 73
 yeah
 but
 we


weren't
 patient
 we
 had
 no
 place
 to
 go


patience
 is
 not
 patience
 is
 not
 sitting


you
 know
 metaphorically
 speaking


Shackled
 to
 no
 no
 sure
 absolutely


absolutely
 what
 are
 the
 state
 of
 stock


markets
 today
 just
 about
 as
 risky
 as


I've
 ever


seen
 I
 think
 um
 the
 long
 period
 of
 time


um
 since
 the
 last
 major
 Market
 event
 has


led


people
 into
 thinking
 that
 they'll
 always


be
 bailed
 out
 that
 there'll
 never
 be


another
 uh
 bare
 Market
 you
 know
 of
 a


1974


1987
 um
 2008


20078
 um
 and
 uh
 Leverage
 is
 uh
 building


and
 building
 um
 risk-taking
 is
 building


and
 that
 those
 statements
 uh
 apply
 also


to
 um
 um
 to
 governments
 it's
 absolutely


astonishing
 this
 this
 nerp
 the
 negative


interest
 rate
 policy
 in
 uh
 Europe
 and


Japan
 and
 Switzerland
 um
 um
 and
 zerp
 for


U
 uh
 what
 10
 years
 in
 the
 US
 it's
 crazy


it's
 crazy
 and
 in


pandemic
 you
 added
 to
 zerp
 you
 added


these
 shockingly
 high
 spending
 deficits


we're
 talking
 about
 deep
 recession
 type


spending
 programs
 spending
 deficits


support
 programs
 um
 at
 a
 time
 when
 there


was
 no
 no
 real
 recession
 MH
 I'm
 talking


about
 I'm
 actually
 talking
 about
 during


covid
 also
 but
 after
 covid
 um
 you
 know


this
 year
 this
 fiscal
 year
 over
 6%
 uh
 in


the
 US
 6%
 um
 of
 GDP
 uh
 deficits
 so
 I


think
 there's
 and
 and
 valuations
 this


this
 AI
 is
 way
 over
 its
 skis
 in
 terms
 of


uh
 um
 practical
 um
 value
 um
 um
 being


brought
 to
 users
 I
 mean
 it
 the
 there
 are


uses
 and
 there
 will
 be
 additional
 uses


but
 it's
 it's
 way
 exaggerated
 how
 do
 you


read
 the
 crypto
 markets
 a
 point
 that
 we


have
 recently
 made
 is
 that
 um
 it
 is
 true


that
 central
 bank
 money
 is
 conjured
 out


of
 thin


air
 doesn't


exist
 but
 what
 also
 is
 true
 about


central
 bank
 money
 is
 that
 it
 is


Sovereign
 it
 has
 Sovereign
 support
 it's


you
 pay
 the
 tax
 you
 you
 pay
 your
 army
 um


in
 that
 money
 um
 to
 the
 extent
 that


governments
 Embrace
 cryptos
 this
 crypto


or
 that
 crypto
 or
 all
 the
 cryptos
 or


several
 of
 the


cryptos
 they
 are


embracing
 alternatives
 to
 Sovereign


money
 so
 what
 are
 and
 therefore
 and


therefore
 is
 the
 money
 Supply
 going
 Hog


Wild
 now
 because
 of
 all
 these
 cryptos


and
 all
 of
 the
 support
 of
 governments
 so


what
 are
 the
 potential
 implications
 for


the
 the
 dollar
 as
 the
 world's
 Reserve


currency
 that's
 the


point
 if
 governments
 are
 supporting
 or


endorsing
 cryptos
 it's
 an
 alternative
 to


the
 dollar
 as
 the
 reserve
 currency
 and


countries
 around
 the
 world
 are
 uh
 as
 you


know
 um
 uh
 not
 happy
 with
 the
 privilege


that
 the
 uh
 US
 Government
 um
 uh
 asserts


as
 the
 central
 bank
 as
 the
 reserve


currency
 country
 of
 the
 world
 they'd


like
 Alternatives
 Now
 isn't
 that


interesting
 they
 they'd
 like


Alternatives
 the
 dollar
 sits
 there


arride
 the
 world
 uh
 with
 all
 the
 abuses


of
 that


asess
 okay
 and
 the
 US
 itself
 is
 uh
 is
 um


Conjuring
 or


supporting
 an
 alternative
 to
 the
 dollar


it
 makes
 my
 head


spin
 how
 do
 you
 relax
 skiing


snowmobiling


sailing


hiking


biking
 music
 why
 is
 music
 important
 for


you
 I
 like
 rock
 music
 and
 I
 have
 a


couple
 of
 bands
 so
 you
 play
 in
 the
 bands


mhm
 keyboards
 proper
 like
 proper
 rock


and


roll


yes
 you
 mean
 it's
 distinguished
 from


hip-hop
 no
 I'm
 just
 asking
 you
 it's


distinguished
 from
 from
 Lonnie
 donagan


or
 yes
 proper
 rock
 and
 roll
 cool
 what
 do


you
 read
 I
 I
 used
 to
 read
 science


fiction
 but
 I
 mostly
 read
 um
 trade
 um


books


research
 it's
 that's
 kind


of
 um
 it's
 kind
 of
 overwhelming
 at
 this


point
 given
 how
 complex
 markets
 are


it's
 uh
 so


I
 don't
 have
 time
 to
 read
 fiction


anymore
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 young


people
 young
 people
 who
 are
 interested


in
 Wall
 Street
 or
 young
 people
 in


general
 or
 young
 people
 who
 would
 like


to
 go
 into


business
 my
 advice
 to
 those
 people
 has


been
 and
 is


um
 um


unchanged
 uh
 over
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time


um
 that
 I
 value
 a
 broad
 classic
 liberal


education
 um
 they
 should
 not
 take


business
 courses
 in
 college
 they
 should


take
 as
 much
 history
 political
 science


philosophy
 religion


um
 uh
 as
 they
 can
 fit
 in
 so
 what
 I'm


what
 I
 try
 to
 convey
 is
 you
 can


specialize
 in
 business
 the
 tools
 of


business
 and
 trading
 I
 mean
 now
 hedge


funds
 private
 Equity
 Venture
 Capital
 you


know
 Hightech
 whatever
 I
 mean
 that's
 the


the
 Golden
 Goose
 but
 um
 in
 all
 of
 that


um
 what
 comes
 out
 if
 you
 if
 you


specialize
 uh
 uh
 too
 U
 too
 soon
 you
 get


you
 get
 this
 narrow
 deep
 skill
 set
 and


you're
 not
 equipped
 for
 the
 things
 that


are
 actually
 happening
 in
 the
 world
 and


so
 um
 I
 think
 um
 I
 think
 that
 stood
 me


in
 good
 stead
 and
 being
 a
 lawyer
 has


stood
 me
 in
 uh
 good
 stad
 although
 my
 my


partner
 is
 is
 not
 a
 lawyer
 he
 thinks


like
 a
 lawyer
 which
 is
 good
 well
 Paul
 I


think
 these
 are
 great
 pieces
 of
 advice


um
 stud
 liberat
 broaden
 out
 don't
 lose


money
 and
 keep
 rocking
 and
 until
 you're


80
 no
 not
