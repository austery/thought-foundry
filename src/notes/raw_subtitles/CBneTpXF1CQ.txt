Clot
 code
 is
 now
 available
 on
 the
 web.


So
 instead
 of
 loading
 up
 your
 terminal


or
 having
 to
 open
 up
 your
 IDE
 anytime


you
 want
 to
 make
 a
 change,
 you
 can
 now


delegate
 coding
 tasks
 directly
 from
 your


browser
 or
 the
 cloud
 mobile
 app.
 You


simply
 connect
 your
 GitHub
 account,
 you


select
 your
 repo,
 describe
 what
 you
 need


done,
 and
 Claude
 handles
 the
 rest,
 all


running
 on
 our
 cloud
 infrastructure.
 And


the
 best
 part
 is
 you
 can
 now
 run


multiple
 tasks
 in
 parallel
 across


different
 repositories.
 So
 whether
 you


have
 a
 bug
 backlog,
 routine
 fixes,
 or
 a


brilliant
 new
 idea
 or
 feature
 you
 want


to
 add,
 you
 can
 just
 spin
 up
 a
 session


or
 multiple
 sessions
 and
 let
 Claude


handle
 them
 simultaneously.
 Let
 me
 show


you
 how
 this
 works.
 So
 I'll
 open
 up


Cloud
 Code
 on
 the
 web
 at
 cloud.ai/code.


I'll
 select
 a
 repo.
 I
 have
 a
 repo


already
 selected
 here.
 And
 then
 I'll


give
 it
 a
 prompt.
 Let's
 say
 add
 input


validation
 to
 the
 user
 registration


endpoint.
 Also
 make
 sure
 we're
 using
 a


strong


password
 on
 both
 the
 front
 end
 and


backend
 API.
 We'll
 hit
 enter
 and
 we
 are


off
 to
 the
 races.
 Claude
 is
 working
 in


its
 own
 isolated
 sandbox
 with
 full


[music]
 git
 access
 and
 we
 can
 watch
 the


progress
 in
 real
 time.
 But
 while
 this


runs,
 let
 me
 tell
 you
 about
 some
 of
 the


other
 stuff
 that
 we've
 recently


launched.


The
 big
 one
 is
 Claude
 Haiku
 4.5.
 And
 a


few
 weeks
 ago,
 we
 launched
 Claude
 Sonnet


4.5,
 which
 became
 the
 world's
 best


coding
 model.
 And
 just
 last
 week,
 we


followed
 it
 up
 with
 Claude
 Haiku
 4.5.


[music]


And
 here's
 the
 really
 remarkable
 thing.


5
 months
 ago,
 Sonnet
 4
 was


state-of-the-art.
 And
 now
 Haiku
 4.5


gives
 you
 a
 similar
 coding
 performance


at
 one/ird
 the
 cost
 and
 more
 than
 twice


the
 speed.
 It
 even
 surpasses
 Sonnet
 4
 at


certain
 tasks
 like
 [music]
 computer
 use.


Now
 the
 benchmarks
 are
 impressive.
 73.3%


on
 Sweetbench
 verified,
 41%
 on
 Terminal


Bench,
 and
 it
 achieves
 90%
 of
 Sonnet


4.5's
 performance
 in
 Agentic
 coding


evaluations.
 But
 the
 big
 question
 you're


probably
 having
 is
 when
 should


developers
 use
 haiku
 [music]
 4.5
 and
 the


big
 pattern
 that
 we're
 seeing
 from
 our


community
 is
 that
 sonnet
 4.5
 does
 the


highlevel
 problem
 decomposition
 and


planning
 and
 then
 haiku
 4.5
 is
 used
 to


actually
 implement
 and
 write
 [music]
 the


code.
 Now
 this
 multi-
 aent
 approach
 is


becoming
 really
 popular
 for
 things
 like


large
 scale
 refactors
 or
 tackling


technical
 debt.
 Haiku
 4.5
 is
 available


wherever
 you
 get
 your
 Claude
 and
 it's


available
 at
 just
 $1
 per
 million
 input


tokens
 and
 $5
 per
 million
 output
 tokens.


All right,
 let's
 check
 back
 on
 our
 task


and
 see
 how
 it's
 doing.


So,
 if
 we
 open
 it
 up
 here,
 we
 can
 see


that
 Claude
 gave
 us
 a
 good
 summary
 of


all
 of
 the
 changes
 that
 it
 made
 uh
 in


the
 service.go
 go
 file
 in
 the
 TypeScript


on
 the
 front
 end.
 And
 my
 absolute


favorite
 feature
 of
 Cloud
 Code
 on
 the


web
 is
 this
 open
 in
 CLI
 button.
 And
 the


reason
 that
 I
 really
 like
 it
 is
 you


simply
 click
 it,
 you
 open
 up
 your


terminal,


paste
 in
 the
 command
 that
 it
 gave
 you,


and
 now
 I
 am
 working
 in
 my
 local


development
 environment
 with
 all
 of
 the


context
 and
 all
 of
 my
 progress
 from
 the


web
 preserved.
 So,
 I
 can
 see
 the


messages.
 I
 can
 see
 all
 of
 the
 files


that
 have
 been
 changed.
 [music]
 I
 can
 go


into
 VS
 Code
 and
 see
 all
 of
 the
 changes


that
 were
 made
 to
 the
 service
 signup,


the
 signup.touchcript
 file,
 and
 much


more.
 And
 I
 can
 continue
 right
 from


where
 I
 left
 off
 on
 my
 mobile
 phone
 or


the
 browser.
 Now,
 I
 want
 to
 show
 you
 one


final
 feature
 that
 we
 recently
 added
 to


Clot
 Code.


I
 gave
 it
 this
 prompt
 earlier


talking
 about
 adding
 [music]
 caching
 to


my
 application,
 but
 I
 gave
 it
 a
 very


broad
 prompt
 saying,
 "Hey,
 I
 would
 like


to
 add
 caching
 to
 my
 application."
 And


what
 Claude
 Code
 did
 is
 it's
 [music]


going
 to
 ask
 me
 a
 number
 of
 follow-up


questions
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 it


implements
 it
 correctly.
 So,
 it's
 going


to
 ask
 the
 caching
 level
 here.
 Uh,


should
 it
 be
 database
 query
 caching,
 API


response
 caching?
 And
 I
 can
 choose
 any


of
 these,
 go
 to
 the
 next
 section
 and


[music]
 figure
 out
 what
 my
 goals
 are.
 Is


it
 to
 improve
 performance,
 reduce


database
 load,
 the
 target
 area,
 is
 it


for
 the
 workout
 data,
 for
 the
 user
 data,


analytics,
 choose
 the
 technology,


Reddus,
 in-memory,
 Postgress,
 and
 then
 I


can
 hit
 submit
 and
 have
 it
 go
 and


implement
 based
 on
 the
 follow-up


information
 that
 I
 gave
 it.


And
 there
 you
 have
 it.
 Cloud
 Code
 on
 the


web
 for
 parallel
 cloud-based
 development


at
 home
 [music]
 and
 on
 the
 go.
 Haiku
 4.5


for
 lightning
 fast
 coding
 at
 a
 fraction


of
 the
 cost
 [music]
 and
 smarter
 local


workflows
 with
 multi-question
 support.


Cloud
 Code
 on
 the
 web
 is
 available
 now


for
 pro
 and
 max
 users
 at
 cloud.ai/code.


Give
 it
 a
 try
 and
 let
 us
 know
 what
 you


think.
 Happy
 building.
