Rising YouTube star Gary Stevenson
from Gary's Economics, has recently
made huge waves with his message
that average people in countries
like the UK will collapse into poverty,
desperate poverty.
I'm talking about Charles Dickens Oliver
Twist that is the future of this country.
If we don't deal with growing inequality,
there is main message is that inequality
can explain essentially everything,
ranging from the weak
recovery from 2008,
the cost of living crisis during Covid.
Stock price rally in the mid 2010s
to the rise of the far right.
And and if you don't take action on it,
it will get worse and worse and worse
and worse.
Luckily, Gary says that inequality
is the core central problem.
I would encourage people to care about it
because if you don't take action on it,
it means living standards
getting worse and worse and worse.
But is he actually correct?
Can you trust Gary Economics?
To tell you the truth, according to Gary.
Academic economists like me, well,
we are part of the problem
because we've created
we've created a system which obviously
takes all the good economists
and said, we are going to fill your mouth
with money if you shut the f up.
Yeah.
Well, Gary, this economist just so happens
to do a series where I fact check
famous YouTubers talking about economics,
using data and academic research.
And a lot of my viewers
asked me to feature your channel today.
So here we are in this series.
I try to stick to the main message only,
which for Gary starts
with the UK inequality crisis
or in Gary's voice.
The UK is in an inequality crisis
because inequality is increasing,
inequality is increasing rapidly.
And in this country we're talking right
now, 150 years
ago, all the ordinary men and women
lived in desperate poverty.
Okay, that's going to happen again
because there's a worryingly accelerating
nature to inequality,
which is the bigger inequalities,
the higher the amount of transfer payments
made from the poor to the rich,
which means the higher the rate
at which the rich dispossessed support,
which means the higher
the rate of transfer payments.
So this is
and probably the thing
which sort of caught me the most
and worried me the most about this.
Mathematically,
this is not self-sustaining.
The fact check these statements
I first search for evidence
that Gary uses himself to back them up.
But strangely enough, in his own videos,
Gary hardly ever uses
any concrete evidence or data.
This is no accident.
Recently on the Desk Rates podcast,
Gary said that it's because I know
the graphs are all bullshit.
I know the Fairness Foundation and from
this and all of the graphs are bullshit.
Now for context.
In this discussion,
the podcast host essentially says, look,
most data about inequality
is actually produced by non-profits
such as the Fairness Foundation
that are explicitly fighting inequality.
So you should be able
to trust them, right?
But when pressed a bit more,
Gary said that the reason why he believes
that graphs are still bullshit
is that we cannot
accurately measure the wealth
of the very rich.
It's very, very difficult.
You know,
we have economists doing that if you want.
There's the economist French guy
Gabriel Zucman. He's really good.
And yeah,
there's actually some truth to that.
It's well known that the super rich hide
a lot of their wealth,
especially in tax havens,
but actually based on new tax haven data.
Gabriel Luqman, Gary's favorite economist,
has estimated that this only accounts
for about 2 to 3% of total UK
household wealth,
because it is really only the top 1%
that can afford to use tax haven services.
So yes, wealth inequality data misses
some wealth for sure,
but it's actually not that much,
at least not for the UK.
If we were studying
Russia, we're much more.
Wealth is hidden offshore
then yes, Gary would have a good point.
We cannot trust the data,
but for the UK and other democracies,
the data is probably pretty accurate.
So to fact check Gary's claims
about inequality, I relied on the database
that Gabrielle Zuckerman
then sues himself.
The World Inequality Database,
The Economist that made this database,
explicitly designed it
to find hidden wealth.
By combining a lot of different data
sources, such as tax
data, private estimates and so forth.
As we can see here,
Gary is right that UK wealth
and income inequality have come down
since the days of Charles Dickens.
We can also see that inequality
is now trending up again.
The top 10% of British households
now own more than 50% of total wealth.
That's a lot.
Meanwhile,
they earn about over 30% of its income.
So yes, Gary is right about the trend
going back up.
But does this trend look anything
like a wall collapse into poverty?
Desperate poverty?
I'm talking about Charles Dickens
Oliver Twist.
That is the future of this country.
If we don't deal with growing inequality.
No, it does not.
In fact, if we compare our top 10% wealth
across the world,
we can see that Britain is alert
yellow, meaning it is actually
one of the most equal countries
in the world.
Interestingly,
if we look at income inequality,
we can see Britain is dark yellow, meaning
it's doing slightly worse still.
As we can see, Britain is one of the more
equal nations on earth.
But hold on, Youri, you sneaky economist.
Gary is very clear on this channel.
He does not talk about working
millionaires.
The top 10%.
He talks about billionaires
the top 1% or even 0.1%.
What have they been up to?
Well, as you can see here, Britain's
1% wealthiest own about 21% of his wealth.
That's slightly higher
than it was at its lowest point ever,
but actually comparable to the 21%
they had in 1980.
We can also see here
that compared to South Africa, the US
and even the world, average
Briton is relatively quite equal.
And strikingly, the claim that there's
a worryingly accelerating
nature to inequality
does not appear to be true at all.
So when it comes to Fact-checking
Gary, he's not off to a great start.
Yes, inequality has been trending up
for the last decade.
That is worrying for sure.
No doubt about that.
But these graphs don't
really fit with Gary's message
of a will collapse into poverty,
desperate poverty.
I'm talking about Charles Dickens,
Oliver Twist.
That is the future of this country.
If we don't deal with growing inequality,
could it be that when Gary says that
I know the graphs are all bullshit
because they are far
less dramatic than Gary's message?
I'm not sure.
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt
for now, because there's actually
some compelling evidence
to support Gary's other claims.
But for diving in, I first want to address
a common criticism.
People comment under videos
critical of Mr.
Gary.
So you criticize Gary.
Are you funded by the rich?
No. Money Macro is an educational channel
that is funded by our patrons,
YouTube advertisements and video sponsors
such as, in this case,
the sponsor of today's video,
Surfshark, which we use it
many a macro for three reasons.
First,
we want to stay as safe as possible,
especially when we work in cafes
with public Wi-Fi.
Second, we actually use Surfshark
to stay in touch with our home country.
You see, our small money
macro team consists of a Brit,
Spaniard and attachment.
But we are based in Belgium.
Therefore, we cannot watch
our favorite public broadcasters,
which are only available back home
unless you use a VPN like Surfshark.
Unique to Surfshark,
this service can be used across
unlimited devices, allowing my wife
to also use it to watch her
favorite American TV shows on streaming
services.
Third, Surfshark has unique extra services
such as Surfshark's super convenient
alternative ID,
which is a browser extension
that allows us to create a virtual ID,
which we can use to register to websites
without giving our private information
out all the time.
Two services that often get hacked
to leak this information.

Okay, with that being said, let's get back
to Gary's second core message.
Inequality drives everything concretely.
Gary seems to believe that.
So I think this makes sense, right?
If you take the consumption power
away from ordinary people who spend,
you give it to rich people who save
what it is awful.
Therefore making a lot of money,
betting that inequality would devastate
living standards
and keep interest rates low
and push house prices
up and push stock prices up.
And therefore,
when it comes to the housing
crisis, Gary says the housing crisis
is not a housing crisis.
The housing crisis is a crisis of asset
affordability.
All asset prices have gone up enormously,
and that means you can't afford them
and you're not going to deal with that
by building more houses.
You need to deal with that
by stopping the inequality growth.
Is that all true?
Sadly, just as with this inequality
explosion claims, Gary hardly
ever backs up any of his claims
with evidence in his own videos.
At least that is a real shame,
because when I started looking into it,
I could find a lot of research
that backs up many of his claims.
For example,
there are some really good studies
by economists from the IMF and world Bank
which present evidence
that rising inequality makes economies
grow more slowly because rich people spend
less than poor people.
Second,
I found some really interesting studies
that present evidence increasing wealth
inequality can cause asset bubbles
because rich people buy more stocks.
Third, I found a study which finds
evidence that increased inequality
may indeed have driven down
interest rates in the US,
as rich people tended
to invest a lot more in government bonds.
Fourth, I found a lot of studies
that confirmed that increased inequality,
together with cultural factors,
can help explain the rise of the far right
in, for example, Nazi Germany
and the USA today.
On top of that,
economists have found that rising
inequality can be linked to more crime,
worse health, and that it may make it
very much more difficult for smart people
from a poor background like perhaps Gary
himself, to make something of themselves.
Inequality research even helped economists
like Angus Deaton
and Daron Acemoglu
to win Nobel Prizes for their work.
So no, Gary, economists
don't ignore inequality.
That being said, I do understand
where Gary is coming from somewhat
when it comes to talking about inequality
in undergraduate economics classes.
Much can be improved.
While some recent textbooks
discuss inequality at length,
other popular economics textbooks
don't talk about it at all.
But besides education
just being a bit slow to adapt,
there's also the reason
that while there is evidence inequality
has a role in driving
almost everything, it is probably not that
only thing that is significantly driving
our economies, as Gary seems to think.
For example.
Well, Gary's theory
predicts that higher inequality
would lead to lower interest rates
and high government debt.
If we look globally, we can clearly see
that this is not the whole story.
For example, more unequal countries
like South Africa and Brazil tend to have
higher interest rates.
Then more equal countries
like for example, Japan and Denmark.
But if we look at government debt,
we can see that a relatively equal country
like Denmark has very little,
while unequal countries
like Japan has a lot, well,
very unequal countries like South Africa
and Brazil are somewhere in the middle.
And then when it comes to housing,
Gary may be doing himself
actually a disservice
by not talking about the data.
Gary seems to think that the rich
are buying up all the houses
as an investment,
which is driving up house prices.
Rich people can only live in 1
or 2 houses.
What are they going to do
with all of these investments?
Either they would rent them out
driving down rent prices,
or you would have a lot of empty homes
sitting there doing nothing like you had
in the US housing bubble in 2006,
or like you have in China today.
If we look at the data, we can see
rents are not going down.
But as you can see here, there are
actually a lot of truly empty homes
in the UK.
About 7% of homes in Wales are empty,
which is depopulating.
And that's likely
not really rich people's thoughts.
But London also has a lot of empty homes,
particularly
if we zoom in on central London.
We can see that about 20% of homes
in Kensington and Westminster are empty.
That is clearly
the ultra wealthy hoarding property.
So here I would say
Gary Storey is a mixed bag.
He is right to point to inequality
being important,
especially in the London housing crisis.
But his various theories
about how inequality is the biggest driver
of just about everything,
ranging from interest rates to government
debt,
that just does not appear to be true.
So then what about the issue
that Gary campaigns for all the time?
A wealth tax?
You see, giving Gary theory
that wealth inequality is causing
almost all of the UK's economic problems.
It makes sense that he believes that.
So I think it's really important
to recognize that these two things are.
But as we've seen, wealth
inequality did not explode.
And that while increased inequality
is bad for the economy,
it cannot explain all of the UK's problems
such as high government debt.
What does this mean for Gary's wealth
tax idea?
Well, I found essentially
two big problems with it.
The first problem is that overall wealth
compared to income
is actually relatively low.
For example, in the UK, total billionaire
wealth was estimated to be around
182 billion pounds in 2024.
That's a lot of money.
Absolutely taxing a bit more of that could
help the UK government do many things.
But just for comparison,
the UK government borrows
almost 150 billion pounds each year.
So Gary's 2% wealth tax proposal,
that's pennies.
If you'd said an 83 wealth
tax proposal for UK billionaires,
you'd only be able to cover government
borrowing for a single year.
The second problem with Gary's
optimistic wealth tax solution is the same
that I've said in my previous video.
Reacting to Gary Ultra
rich people are very mobile.
Yes, we are not sure how many millionaires
left the UK after taxes rose recently,
but there are various reports
that quite a few rich people left Norway
to flee its wealth tax.
And when France still had a wealth tax,
many wealthy French people
famously moved to London.
Similarly, many people are now moving
from the UK to Milan
after it introduced a very low tax
for very wealthy people.
Almost all super wealthy F1 drivers
live in Monaco, which is a tax haven.
Overall, there is a lot of evidence
that many rich people
will successfully dodge
high taxes by moving to another country.
Gary has always reacted to this argument
by saying that taxing the rich
will be very, very difficult.
It's possible
these people are not magicians.
These people are not Gandalf.
They can't magic themselves
out of the country and disappear.
All of the wealth out of the country.
The wealth is here.
It's the wealth of our countries.
In other words, while
billionaires can move, they cannot move
all their wealth.
The wealth remains in Britain
when it comes to property.
This certainly applies.
In fact,
after seeing how many homes are empty
in London, I think Gary could make
a really convincing case
that Britain needs a wealth tax
on property rather than its current
council and stamp duty taxes.
This could be great
for the British economy, as it may
allow more nurses and teachers
to live in central London
if the ultra rich start
renting it out to pay for this wealth tax.
However, most assets
that the ultra rich have are not property.
When our wealth tax was discussed
for the US many years ago,
economists were quick to point out
that about 80% of the assets
of the ultra wealthy are financial assets,
such as government bonds or bank deposits
that can be easily moved elsewhere.
They can do this because countries
like the UK have free capital flows.
Similarly, when Norway introduce
a wealth tax, many of its entrepreneurs
fled to Switzerland
thanks to free trade agreements.
Countries cannot tax imports, so this
wealth is not tied to the country either.
Norwegian entrepreneurs
can just take their company headquarters
with them and then export to Norway.
These problems could explain
why Gary recently talked
about wealth tax complexity
in the following terms.
I think really encapsulates
the childish naivety that I talk about.
If people turn around to me, this
okay, I show, all right.
Show me the tax policy
in, show me the tax policy.
You know, you know, obviously
I'm here in my kitchen, right?
Which is real, like with a massive YouTube
channel.
Like, I'm pretty much pretty obviously
the world's biggest campaigner
for wealth taxes. And I work hard. Right.
Do you think tax policies are usually made
by YouTubers?
Yeah. Gary is of course right.
Tax systems are designed by economists
and then they are implemented
by politicians and lawyers, many of them
who then often water them down
living in tiny loopholes.
The bright side, if we look at the data,
we can see that taxes
do already decrease inequality.
For example.
As you can see here, income inequality
in the UK before taxes is almost as bad
as it is in the US, but after taxes
it is much better despite that.
Yeah, I agree with Gary
that the current tax system is not fair.
New research by US
economist Zuckerman shows that US
billionaires
only pay an average tax rate of about 24%.
That's much lower than what
the middle class would pay.
Totally unfair.
A fairly recent study in the UK
found that if high income earners paid
headline rates, they would have to pay
23 billion more than they currently do.
That's a lot of money,
no doubt about it, but a solution
to fix the entire UK economy?
No, sorry, that's
just 2% of total government income today.
So where does that leave Gary?
In other words,
can you trust Gary's economics?
Well, to me, it's a mixed bag.
Gary is right
that rising inequality is a big problem.
Gary is fighting for a fairer tax system
which is needed.
Yet there is so much good research about
how bad inequality is and why it's bad.
And Gary doesn't use it.
He rather relies on his own theories.
There's so many proposals
about how to reform the tax system,
but Gary doesn't appear to have read them
carefully.
Instead, he makes a lot of exaggerated
statements like how Britain will collapse
because of skyrocketing inequality,
which is clearly not true.
That is a shame because to get a fairer
tax system,
Gary has said that I think in particular
we need
what I am thinking of as academic cover,
which is economists,
people that think tanks, people
with these kind of academic credentials.
And to get that,
I think he needs to be a little bit
less hyperbolic with his messaging
and be a bit more evidence based.
This is, of course, easier said than done,
because so far Gary has built a massive
following precisely
with very hyperbolic collapse messages
that tap into very legitimate problems,
like the massive
housing
and cost of living crisis in the UK.
He boasts about how great his predictions
are about rising asset prices
and falling living standards.
And I take this.
And yeah, so far they've not been perfect.
But it's pretty good to be
a successful trader like Gary clearly was.
That's all you need to be, right more
often than wrong about financial assets.
This is how you make money.
But to convince researchers your theory
should not only predict the future
a couple of times,
your theory should also be able to explain
why inequality is not increasing
so fast anymore,
why super unequal countries actually have
relatively high interest rates,
and why some very equal countries
have very high government debt.
If Gary can improve his theories
to line up with all the evidence,
such as how research has shown
that ignoring inequality leads
to a worse economy, more crime, worse
health, and the rise of the far right
then I think Gary can succeed
to make his case
with people with,
as he says, academic credentials.
