This
 video
 series
 is
 for
 tech


professionals
 already
 living
 and
 working


in
 the
 US,
 Canada,
 the
 UK,
 or
 the


European
 Union.
 If
 you're
 based
 outside


these
 regions
 or
 in
 an
 outsourcing
 heavy


market,
 the
 data
 in
 this
 video
 will
 not


apply
 to
 your
 situation.
 I
 do
 not
 cover


immigration,
 international
 job
 hunting,


or
 topics
 like
 how
 to
 break
 into
 tech


without
 a
 college
 degree.
 If
 that's
 what


you're
 here
 for,
 this
 probably
 isn't
 the


right
 channel,
 and
 that's
 okay.
 But
 if


you
 are
 operating
 within
 these
 markets,


keep
 watching.
 There's
 a
 lot
 ahead
 for


various
 seniority
 levels
 and
 career


tracks
 in
 tech.
 Welcome
 to
 episode
 two


of
 my
 series,
 Where
 to
 Run,
 where
 we


look
 at
 where
 tech
 professionals
 living


in
 the
 US,
 Canada,
 the
 United
 Kingdom,


or
 the
 European
 Union
 are
 resettling


after
 the
 past
 3
 years
 politely
 wrecked


their
 career
 plans.
 Last
 time
 we
 talked


about
 the
 city
 in
 the
 US
 that
 are
 worth


considering
 post
 layoffs.
 And
 today


we're
 talking
 about
 Canada.
 This
 is


Daria
 and
 this
 is
 Tech
 Make
 It
 Real.


Don't
 forget
 to
 subscribe
 and
 give
 us
 a


thumbs
 up.
 We're
 putting
 a
 lot
 of
 work


into
 this
 channel.
 Starting
 with


Toronto
 tech
 scene
 and
 culture.
 I
 will


be
 comparing
 Toronto
 to
 big
 cities
 in


the
 US
 and
 I
 would
 like
 to
 be
 doing
 that


throughout
 the
 entire
 series
 as
 I
 simply


find
 it
 interesting
 to
 compare
 the


dynamics
 of
 different
 tech
 cultures


across
 the
 world.
 And
 I'm
 not
 trying
 to


say
 that
 one
 is
 better
 than
 the
 other.


Toronto
 is
 the
 largest
 and
 the
 most


significant
 tech
 hub
 in
 North
 America


outside
 of
 the
 United
 States.
 No,
 it


doesn't
 have
 the
 raw
 scale
 of
 San


Francisco
 and
 it's
 nowhere
 close
 to
 the


chaos
 of
 NYC.
 However,
 what
 we
 do
 have


is
 the
 top-notch
 intellectual
 talent.
 We


are
 a
 very
 popular
 destination
 for
 two


types
 of
 tech
 workers.
 Number
 one,


locals
 or
 number
 two,
 mid
 to
 senior


level
 professionals
 who
 already
 worked


in
 the
 US
 and
 decided
 to
 move
 north


either
 due
 to
 lifestyle
 preferences
 or


to
 avoid
 the
 polarization
 of
 the
 US


politics.
 And
 this
 is
 because


talent-wise,
 we
 are
 definitely
 on
 par


with
 the
 US.
 Maybe
 speed-wise,
 not
 as


fast
 as
 California,
 but
 definitely
 on


par
 with
 Seattle
 and
 Austin.
 And
 number


two,
 many
 companies
 in
 Canada
 work
 with


the
 US
 market
 or
 serve
 the
 US
 clients.


For
 people
 based
 in
 Canada,
 many
 roles


still
 have
 you
 working
 very
 close
 with


the
 US.
 This
 is
 actually
 my
 situation.


Throughout
 my
 entire
 career,
 every


company
 that
 I
 worked
 for
 either


switched
 to
 the
 US
 market
 or
 has
 always


focused
 on
 the
 US
 market.
 Quality
 of


talent.
 Canada
 has
 a
 very
 strong


intellectual
 capital.
 Canadian


universities
 offer
 excellent
 education


nationwide.
 Even
 smaller
 schools


maintain
 high
 academic
 standards.


Toronto
 is
 Canada's
 undisputed
 tech


capital
 with
 a
 deep
 bunch
 of
 talent


coming
 out
 of
 the
 University
 of
 Toronto


and
 the
 University
 of
 Wateroo.
 The
 vibes


Toronto
 tech
 scene
 is
 chill
 relative
 to


the
 US
 and
 active
 relative
 to
 Europe.


When
 you
 come
 to
 tech
 meetups,
 you
 will


often
 hear
 people
 talking
 about
 job


search,
 switching
 jobs,
 the
 typical


9to-5,
 how
 many
 projects
 they
 have
 going


on,
 where
 they
 travel
 on
 the
 weekend,


etc.
 When
 you
 travel
 to
 the
 US,
 you
 hear


a
 very
 sharp
 contrast.
 And
 when
 you


travel
 to
 Europe,
 you
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


realize
 that
 there
 is
 life
 outside
 of


work.
 I
 guess
 the
 filter
 that
 I'm


putting
 on
 this
 has
 to
 do
 with
 the
 fact


that
 I
 travel
 a
 lot
 to
 the
 US
 and
 attend


various
 tech
 meetups
 and
 conferences.


And
 I
 can
 hear
 it
 in
 the
 conversations.


You
 come
 to
 a
 typical
 New
 York
 meetup


and
 you'd
 find
 six
 founders,
 two
 to


three
 people
 who
 sold
 their
 companies,
 a


few
 people
 from
 Fang
 and
 some
 PMs


building
 a
 GBT
 rapper
 on
 the
 side,


people
 are
 hungry,
 people
 are
 wired,


it's
 a
 go
 go go
 environment.
 If
 Europe


is
 on
 the
 other
 extreme
 where
 you're


reminded
 that
 work
 is
 just
 one
 part
 of


life,
 people
 don't
 obsess
 over
 growth


metrics
 at
 dinner,
 Toronto
 sits


somewhere
 in
 the
 middle.
 It's
 stable,


ambitious,
 but
 not
 aggressive.
 And
 the


reason
 why
 we
 don't
 have
 an


international
 reputation
 as
 the
 tech


mecca
 despite
 the
 exceptional
 quality
 of


talent
 is
 because
 from
 a
 financial
 and


structural
 perspective,
 Canada
 simply


doesn't
 support
 the
 same
 level
 of


entrepreneurial
 ambition.
 And
 this
 in


turn
 means
 that
 the
 investor
 climate
 is


very
 modest.
 VC
 funding
 volume
 is
 a


fraction
 of
 what
 you
 would
 see
 in
 the


US.
 In
 2024,
 US
 startups
 raised
 over
 100


$140
 billion
 versus
 Canada
 raised
 around


$7
 billion
 and
 most
 of
 that
 went
 to
 late


stage
 and
 already
 US
 attached
 ventures.


Capital
 gains
 tax
 here
 is
 higher
 and


regulatory
 hurdles
 are
 very
 real,


especially
 in
 health
 tech,
 fintech
 and


AI.
 As
 a
 result,
 many
 high
 talent


individuals
 with
 big
 ambitions
 move


south.
 And
 there
 is
 a
 reason
 why
 people


like
 these
 gentlemen,
 both
 trained
 in


Canada,
 ended
 up
 building
 transformative


companies
 in
 the
 US
 rather
 than
 staying


local.
 This
 is
 heartbreaking
 to
 me


because
 I
 can
 see
 how
 much
 brains
 and


potential
 Canada
 has.
 But
 when
 a


Canadian
 receives
 an
 offer
 in
 the
 US,


provided
 they
 do
 not
 have
 a
 very
 strong


political
 stance
 and
 refuse
 to
 go
 to
 a


blue
 state
 or
 a
 red
 state
 for


ideological
 purposes,
 they
 will
 take
 it


up.
 Cost
 of
 living
 and
 salaries.
 This
 is


a
 tough
 one
 because
 the
 economic


situation
 has
 flipped
 upside
 down
 in
 the


past
 eight
 years.
 So,
 please
 take
 this


with
 a
 grain
 of
 salt
 because
 as
 someone


who
 lives
 in
 Canada,
 I
 have
 seen
 what


has
 happened
 to
 the
 country
 and
 I
 cannot


simply
 stay
 unbiased
 in
 this
 case.


Toronto
 is
 becoming
 increasingly


difficult
 to
 live
 in.
 Our
 salaries,
 at


least
 in
 tech,
 have
 remained
 largely


flat,
 but
 the
 cost
 of
 living
 is
 going
 up


year
 over
 year.
 Unlike
 the
 US
 where
 you


can
 find
 tech
 hubs
 in
 the
 states
 with


active
 and
 rising
 tax
 scene
 and
 no
 state


income
 tax,
 in
 Canada
 we
 do
 not
 have


such
 option.
 There
 are
 three
 big
 tech


hubs
 in
 the
 country.
 All
 three
 of
 them


I'm
 talking
 about
 today
 and
 none
 of
 them


is
 in
 the
 low
 tax
 province.
 Now
 if
 you


manage
 to
 land
 a
 fully
 remote
 offer
 and


make
 a
 Toronto
 or
 a
 Vancouver
 level


salary
 but
 live
 for
 example
 in
 Alberta,


that
 would
 be
 a
 very
 sweet
 deal.
 But
 I


have
 to
 mention
 that
 A
 it's
 becoming


increasingly
 difficult
 to
 land
 fully


remote
 jobs
 and
 B
 not
 everybody
 can


survive
 Alberta
 weather.
 Canada
 is
 not
 a


warm
 country
 after
 all.
 In
 terms
 of


salaries,
 we
 are
 mostly
 comparable
 to


London,
 UK.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 salaries


versus
 cost
 of
 living,
 we
 make
 more
 than


Europeans
 but
 significantly
 less
 than


the
 US.
 Our
 taxes
 are
 very
 high
 and
 they


do
 eat
 into
 the
 salary.

Conclusion.
 At
 which
 stage
 of
 your


professional
 career
 is
 Toronto
 a
 good


choice?
 If
 you
 plan
 on
 building
 a
 life


and
 working
 in
 Canada
 and
 are
 okay
 with


taxes
 if
 you
 want
 a
 calmer,
 less
 hectic


life
 but
 still
 a
 tech
 city
 with
 plenty


of
 social
 activities.
 If
 you
 value


highquality
 talent
 that
 you
 can
 learn


from.
 And
 if
 entrepreneurship
 or
 being


around
 entrepreneurs
 is
 not
 your
 top


priority.
 If
 you
 plan
 on
 staying


employed
 and
 building
 your
 career
 in


employment.
 A
 few
 words
 on
 layoffs.
 Yes,


Canada
 has
 been
 hit
 just
 as
 hard
 as
 the


US.
 However,
 despite
 the
 size
 of
 the


country,
 our
 tech
 talent
 is
 concentrated


in
 the
 three
 major
 cities.
 And
 with
 more


companies
 requiring
 hybrid
 presence
 in


office,
 Toronto
 remains
 to
 be
 the
 best


bet
 for
 tech
 workers
 post
 layoffs.
 When


is
 it
 not
 worth
 it?
 If
 you
 want
 to
 own
 a


property
 without
 being
 in
 debt
 for
 the


next
 30
 years,
 settling
 Toronto
 may
 not


be
 a
 very
 good
 choice.
 If
 you
 want
 a


good
 and
 comfortable
 life
 before
 you


start
 pulling
 in
 at
 least
 $100,000
 a


year,
 and
 I
 get
 it,
 comfortable
 means


different
 things
 to
 different
 people.


So,
 here's
 what
 I
 mean
 when
 I
 say


comfortable.
 You
 can
 afford
 rent
 or
 a


mortgage
 on
 a
 single
 income
 without


having
 to
 have
 roommates.
 If
 you
 can
 eat


out
 at
 restaurants
 at
 least
 twice
 a
 week


without
 guilt,
 you
 can
 take
 at least
 two


international
 trips
 a
 year.
 You
 can


afford
 hobbies
 like
 tennis,
 music


lessons,
 etc.
 And
 yes,
 you
 can
 still


save
 comfortably.
 It
 is
 extremely
 rare


to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 this
 combination
 in


Toronto
 until
 you
 start
 pulling
 at
 least


$100
 to
 $120,000
 a
 year.
 Moving
 on
 to


Vancouver
 tax
 scene
 and
 culture.
 There


is
 a
 world
 of
 a
 difference
 between


Toronto
 and
 Vancouver
 in
 the
 pace
 and
 in


the
 lifestyle.
 Vancouver
 is
 a
 peaceful,


calm
 place
 with
 beautiful
 nature.
 But


again,
 one's
 perception
 may
 vary


depending
 on
 what
 kind
 of
 background


you've
 you're
 coming
 from
 and
 the
 cities


that
 you've
 lived
 in.
 Vancouver
 ranks
 as


Canada's
 second
 best
 startup
 ecosystem


and
 is
 globally
 recognized
 within
 the


top
 50
 startups
 across
 the
 world.
 Given


that
 the
 focus
 of
 this
 conversation
 is


on
 employees
 and
 not
 founders,
 this


means
 that
 the
 job
 pool
 you
 will
 be


focusing
 on
 will
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 startup


roles
 if
 that's
 your
 thing.
 Key
 sectors


include
 clean
 tech,
 life
 sciences,


entertainment
 such
 as
 animation
 and


gaming
 and
 blockchain
 tech.
 One
 caveat


though,
 while
 Vancouver
 excels
 at


forming
 startups,
 scaling
 beyond
 series


B
 remains
 a
 challenge
 with
 some


companies
 relocating
 headquarters
 to
 the


US
 for
 growth.
 Quality
 of
 talent.


Vancouver
 is
 less
 diverse
 on
 the
 talent


front
 where
 people
 who
 mostly
 work
 in


the
 tech
 industry
 either
 grew
 up
 in


Vancouver
 or
 went
 to
 school
 in


Vancouver.
 University
 of
 Colombia
 is
 a


great
 school.
 It
 excels
 in
 precision


medicine
 and
 healthcare
 AI
 application.


those
 who
 love
 and
 value
 the
 vibe
 of


British
 Columbia.
 They
 want
 the
 nature.


They
 want
 the
 ocean.
 They
 want
 the


mountains.
 They
 just
 simply
 want
 to
 live


there
 and
 raise
 their
 families
 there.
 Or


the
 ones
 who
 get
 job
 offers
 and
 relocate


specifically
 because
 they
 were
 offered
 a


good
 contract.
 Vancouver
 is
 a
 home
 to


headquarters
 of
 Lululemon,
 not
 a


technative
 company,
 but
 still
 they're


investing
 in
 tech
 division
 and
 tech


products.
 Aritzia
 is
 in
 the
 same


situation.
 And
 for
 technative
 companies,


Amazon,
 Hootsweet,
 and
 Unity,
 the


vibes.
 Think
 Seattle's
 chill
 cousin
 who


does
 yoga
 at
 sunrise,
 co
 by
 noon,
 and


hits
 the
 mountains
 by
 4:00.
 Vancouver
 is


calm,
 balanced,
 and
 very
 west
 coast.
 By


Canadian
 standards,
 the
 tech
 scene
 is


growing,
 but
 in
 my
 view,
 if
 I
 feel
 like


Toronto
 is
 a
 little
 slow,
 Vancouver
 is


on
 vacation.
 People
 there
 always


prioritize
 quality
 of
 life
 over
 hustle


culture.
 you
 won't
 find
 the
 same


cutthroat
 urgency
 as
 San
 Francisco,
 New


York,
 or
 even
 Toronto.
 And
 that's
 kind


of
 the
 point.
 People
 here
 do
 care
 about


their
 work,
 but
 they
 also
 care
 about


skiing,
 hiking,
 and
 not
 answering
 Slack


after
 6
 p.m.
 A
 good
 friend
 of
 mine
 was


saying
 that
 it's
 really
 difficult
 to


make
 friends
 or
 find
 a
 partner
 in


Vancouver
 if
 you're
 not
 into
 outdoorsy


activities.
 So,
 yeah,
 very
 West
 Coast.


It
 is
 perfect
 if
 you're
 craving


stability,
 nature,
 and
 a
 slower
 pace.


But
 if
 you're
 looking
 to
 be
 in
 the
 eye


of
 high
 growth,
 hyper
 competition,


Vancouver
 is
 a
 little
 too
 zen.
 Cost
 of


living
 and
 salaries.
 This
 is
 the
 biggest


downside
 of
 the
 city.
 Vancouver's
 cost


of
 living
 is
 ridiculously
 high
 for
 the


size
 of
 its
 tax
 scene.
 Rent
 is
 on
 par


with
 major
 US
 cities.
 Expect
 to
 pay


$25,000
 at
 least
 for
 a
 one-bedroom


condo.
 And
 home
 ownership
 is
 borderline


fantasy
 unless
 you're
 bringing
 in
 fang


level
 compensation.
 And
 even
 then,
 I


would
 say
 both
 you
 and
 your
 partner


better
 be
 bringing
 home
 fang
 level
 comp.


Groceries
 and
 dining
 out
 are
 pricey.


Salaries
 don't
 always
 keep
 up.
 They're


usually
 the
 same
 as
 Toronto
 or
 slightly


higher,
 but
 the
 cost
 of
 living
 makes
 the


difference
 insignificant.
 So,
 while
 the


lifestyle
 is
 great,
 your
 bank
 account


will
 not
 be
 happy.


[Music]


Conclusion,
 at
 which
 stage
 of
 your


career
 is
 Vancouver
 worth
 it?
 Vancouver


is
 suitable
 for
 people
 who
 either
 get


solid
 job
 offers
 where
 the
 compensation


justifies
 the
 move
 or
 if
 you
 dream
 about


living
 in
 the
 West
 Coast
 and
 are
 willing


to
 pay
 for
 it.
 When
 is
 it
 not
 worth
 it


if
 you're
 relocating
 without
 a
 solid
 job


offer
 or
 salary
 that
 offsets
 Vancouver's


brutal
 cost
 of
 living?
 It's
 also
 not
 a


good
 idea
 if
 you're
 in
 your
 early
 career


and
 need
 to
 build
 a
 strong
 professional


network
 and
 gain
 traction
 in
 high
 growth


environments.
 And
 lastly,


moral
 tech
 scene
 and
 culture.
 Montreal


absolutely
 has
 a
 tech
 scene
 and
 it's


more
 legit
 than
 most
 people
 realize.


Montreal
 has
 deep
 academic
 roots
 and
 is


becoming
 the
 Canadian
 AI
 hub.
 It
 has
 a


strong
 presence
 in
 gaming,
 VFX,


animation,
 space
 tech,
 deep
 tech,
 and


clean
 tech
 startups.
 Startups
 and


scaleups
 are
 thriving,
 especially
 in
 SAS


and
 AI
 adjacent
 areas.
 Montreal
 gives


access
 to
 very
 solid
 universities
 and


access
 to
 French
 and
 European
 markets.


Quality
 of
 talent.
 The
 city
 produces


most
 tech
 graduates
 in
 Canada
 annually


with
 over
 81,000
 students
 enrolled
 in


software
 engineering
 programs.
 Montreal


is
 a
 hub
 for
 AI
 research
 with


institutions
 like
 Montreal
 Institute
 for


Learning
 Algorithms
 and
 over
 35,000
 AI


experts.
 Multinational
 tech
 giants
 such


as
 Microsoft
 Meta
 and
 DeepMind
 have


established
 AI
 R&D
 centers
 in
 the
 city.


Montreal's
 lower
 cost
 of
 living
 compared


to
 Toronto
 or
 Vancouver
 makes
 it
 very


attractive
 for
 startups
 and


professionals.
 Nevertheless,
 despite
 the


strengths,
 Montreal
 faces
 funding
 gaps


that
 limit
 scaling
 opportunities


compared
 to
 Toronto
 VC
 ecosystem.
 The


vibes
 Montreal
 and
 Quebec
 in
 general
 is


a
 very
 special
 place
 in
 Canada.


Montreal's
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 taste
 and


elegance,
 and
 it's
 very
 affordable
 by


Canadian
 standards.
 It
 is
 bilingual.
 It


is
 full
 of
 culture.
 It
 is
 buzzing
 with


AI
 research
 and
 gaming
 studios.
 The
 pace


is
 definitely
 slower
 than
 Toronto,
 but


more
 experimental
 than
 Vancouver.
 People


in
 Montreal
 build
 really
 cool
 stuff
 and


often
 more
 out
 of
 curiosity
 than
 pure


capitalism.
 If
 you're
 into
 AI
 design
 or


gaming
 and
 have
 appreciation
 for
 French


Canadian
 culture,
 Montreal
 has
 a
 legit


appeal.
 Cost
 of
 living
 and
 salaries.


Montreal
 is
 much
 more
 affordable
 than


Toronto
 and
 Vancouver.
 Rent
 is
 lower.


Dining
 out
 is
 more
 affordable.
 Groceries


are
 cheaper.
 Compensation
 wise,
 it
 is


significantly
 less
 than
 Toronto.
 On


average,
 the
 difference
 is
 about
 $30
 to


$40,000
 for
 a
 product
 manager,
 a
 data


scientist,
 or
 a
 software
 engineer.
 Now,


if
 you
 manage
 to
 land
 a
 remote
 role
 and


the
 company
 is
 willing
 to
 pay
 you


Toronto
 salary
 while
 allowing
 you
 to


live
 in
 Montreal,
 that
 would
 be
 a


fantastic
 deal.
 Montreal
 is
 one
 of
 my


favorite
 cities
 in
 Canada,
 I
 considered


moving
 there
 several
 times
 in
 my
 life,


but
 the
 problem
 was
 always
 the
 money.


The
 moment
 I
 dropped
 a
 comment
 about


relocating
 to
 Quebec,
 I
 was
 told
 that


the
 salary
 would
 be
 adjusted.
 So,
 I
 sat


down,
 did
 the
 math,
 and
 for
 me,
 for
 my


goals
 and
 ambitions,
 a
 move
 to
 Montreal


would
 mean
 taking
 a
 step
 back
 in
 money


and
 the
 size
 of
 network.
 But
 if
 I
 ever


decide
 to
 invest
 in
 real
 estate
 in


Canada,
 I'm
 sure
 it'll
 be
 in
 Quebec.


[Music]


Conclusion:
 When
 is
 it
 worth
 it?
 If
 you


work
 in
 science
 tech
 and
 having
 access


to
 top-notch
 academia
 talent
 is


something
 that
 matters
 to
 you,
 Montreal


is
 a
 fantastic
 choice.
 If
 you're
 looking


for
 more
 heritage,
 more
 culture,
 more


history
 than
 typically
 present
 in
 North


American
 cities.
 If
 you're
 looking
 for


more
 affordable
 life
 while
 having
 access


to
 tech
 scene,
 but
 high
 salary
 is
 not


your
 biggest
 priority,
 Montreal
 is
 a


fantastic
 choice.
 When
 is
 it
 not
 worth


it?
 If
 you
 need
 constant
 access
 to
 tech


network
 that
 will
 propel
 you
 forward
 and


help
 you
 with
 connections
 around
 the


world.
 If
 you
 prefer
 intensity
 and


hyperrowth
 culture,
 if
 you
 love
 the


speed
 and
 thrive
 in
 chaos,
 Montreal
 is


not
 going
 to
 give
 you
 that.
 These
 are


the
 three
 cities
 where
 Canadian
 tech


talent
 is
 concentrating
 after
 the


layoffs.
 Tell
 me
 what
 you
 guys
 think
 and


if
 there
 are
 any
 places
 you're


interested
 to
 know
 more
 about.
 In
 the


next
 episode,
 we
 will
 leave
 North


America
 and
 focus
 on
 the
 post
 layoffs


mid
 to
 senior
 levels
 tech
 force
 in


Scandinavia.
 I
 hope
 this
 was
 helpful.


Till
 next
 time.
 Bye.
