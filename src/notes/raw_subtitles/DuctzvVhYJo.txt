[Music]


hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangin
 and
 today


I'm
 in
 really
 good
 company
 with
 Julie


sweet
 the
 CEO
 and
 chair
 of
 Accenture


which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 world
 largest
 and


most
 influential
 Professional
 Services


Company
 and
 under
 her
 leadership


Accenture
 has
 led
 the
 way
 in
 digital


transformation
 Innovation
 and
 helping


businesses
 worldwide
 to
 harness
 the


power
 of
 technology
 and
 we
 are
 lucky


because
 in
 the
 fund
 we
 own
 more
 than
 1%


of
 the
 company
 worth
 more
 than
 $2


billion
 so
 welcome
 jie
 thank
 you
 for


having
 me
 today
 now
 you
 employ
 more
 than


7
 100,000
 people
 which
 is
 more
 people


than
 in
 the
 whole
 of
 Oslo
 and
 so
 how
 do


you
 run
 a
 company
 like
 that
 with
 a
 lot


of
 help
 so
 I've
 got
 a
 great
 leadership


team
 and
 uh
 we
 have
 a
 really
 good
 way
 of


operating
 so
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 first


did
 when
 I
 became
 CEO
 was
 to
 actually


change
 the
 way
 that
 we
 were
 organized
 so


that
 we
 could
 be
 much
 closer
 to
 our


clients
 and
 our
 people
 because
 as
 you


scale
 it's
 really
 important
 that
 your


leaders
 are
 close
 to
 your
 people
 stupid


question
 what
 does
 Accentra
 actually
 do


it's
 a
 great
 question
 so
 uh
 so
 if
 you


think
 about
 uh
 we
 we
 work
 for


governments
 and
 for
 companies
 but


sticking
 with
 a
 company
 for
 a
 moment
 so


if
 you
 think
 about
 a
 company
 we
 help
 our


clients
 reinvent
 literally
 every
 part
 of


their
 company
 using
 technology
 data
 and


AI
 to
 do
 one
 of
 two
 things
 to
 either


grow
 more
 or
 to
 be
 more
 efficient
 like


that's
 the
 very
 simple
 thing
 so
 that


means
 that
 we'll
 do
 everything
 from


helping


BBVA
 um
 have
 uh
 their
 customers
 be
 able


to
 join
 the
 bank
 in
 minutes
 instead
 of
 a


week
 so
 that's
 all
 about
 growth
 to
 um


helping
 a
 company
 be
 able
 to
 take
 out


major
 costs
 using
 technology
 and
 Ai
 and


their
 Finance
 function
 that's
 about


efficiency
 to
 um
 helping
 uh
 clients
 who


make
 things
 so
 who
 manufacture
 things


digitize
 so
 we
 helped
 Mars
 for
 example


if
 you
 like
 uh
 Skittles
 we
 helped
 make


sure
 that
 you
 get
 the
 exact
 number
 of


Skittles


in
 your
 Skittle
 package
 not
 one
 more
 or


one
 less
 and
 so
 and
 all
 of
 those
 things


at
 the
 heart
 are
 combining
 technology


data
 and
 AI
 with
 deep
 industry
 knowledge


where
 do
 companies
 need
 the
 most
 help


just
 now
 well
 top
 of
 everyone's
 agenda


is
 how
 do
 I
 use
 AI
 yeah
 and
 what
 I
 would


tell
 you
 that
 where
 they
 really
 need
 the


most
 help
 still
 is
 that
 most
 companies


today
 are
 not
 as
 digital
 as
 they
 need
 to


be
 no
 so
 they
 haven't
 built
 the
 digital


core
 that
 allows
 them
 to
 use
 AI
 so
 they


start
 with
 help
 me
 with
 AI
 and
 then
 very


quickly
 we
 are
 helping
 clients


understand
 what
 does
 it
 take
 to
 actually


be
 able
 to
 use
 AI
 but
 for
 you
 to
 help


them
 you
 need
 to
 learn
 it
 first
 right
 we


have
 a
 very
 strong
 culture
 of
 learning


yeah
 uh
 so
 for
 example
 I
 don't
 know
 if


you're
 familiar
 with
 the
 Gallup
 strength


finder
 so
 we
 use
 Gallup
 strength
 finder


for
 Accenture
 and
 um
 that
 is
 something


that
 helps
 people
 evaluate
 what
 their


strengths
 are
 so
 we
 have
 700,000
 people


over
 300,000
 people
 have
 used
 this
 tool


how
 does
 it
 work
 and
 so
 basically
 it


assesses
 you
 against
 34
 strengths
 and


the
 theory
 is
 that
 you
 should
 do
 things


that
 are
 your
 strengths
 and
 do
 less
 of


things
 that
 are
 not
 your
 strengths
 so


there's
 34
 different
 strengths
 so


they're
 neutral
 like
 they're
 all


strengths
 it's
 just
 which
 ones
 you
 have


so
 we
 have
 over
 300,000
 people
 who've


gone
 through
 the
 assessment
 it's
 very


rapid
 our
 number
 number
 two
 strength
 is


learner
 and
 so
 our
 people
 are
 Learners


they
 like
 the
 process
 of
 learning
 the


number
 one
 strength
 by
 the
 way
 is


responsibility
 meaning
 they
 say
 what
 you


do
 so
 if
 you
 think
 about
 in
 my
 business


right
 that's
 super
 important
 and
 why
 do


I
 say
 that's
 important
 uh
 the
 the


learner
 piece
 is
 important
 is
 because


when
 things
 change
 all
 the
 time
 you
 have


to
 have
 people
 who
 Embrace
 change
 and


embrace
 learning
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 get


the
 speed
 up
 to
 work
 faster
 as
 a
 firm


uh
 two
 things
 one
 a
 culture
 that


Embraces
 change
 two
 a
 growth
 model
 a
 way


of
 organizing
 and
 and
 um
 and
 operating


that
 supports
 it
 so
 we
 when
 I
 joined


Accenture
 in
 2010
 the
 CEO
 said
 we're
 all


about
 change
 that
 is
 our
 culture
 um
 when


you
 think
 about
 what
 do
 you
 have
 to
 do


to
 um
 actually
 operate
 in
 different
 ways


when
 we
 set
 our
 strategic
 goals
 we
 don't


set
 them
 on
 a
 fiscal
 year
 because
 life


doesn't
 move
 on
 a
 fiscal
 year
 I
 uh
 I


think
 in
 the
 past
 you
 were
 more
 like
 a


fast
 follower
 and
 now
 you
 are
 a
 change


agent
 what
 does
 it
 take
 to
 install
 that


type
 of
 culture
 manm
 so
 um
 well
 it's


interesting
 though
 so
 when
 I
 joined


Accenture
 the
 CEO
 said
 two
 things
 he


said
 I
 when
 I
 asked
 him
 about
 the


culture
 he
 said
 we're
 all
 about
 change


and
 we're
 fast
 followers
 and
 so
 we
 then


that
 was
 in
 2010
 in


2013
 we
 missed
 revenue
 for
 only
 I
 think


the
 second
 time
 in
 our
 history
 we
 knew


that
 every
 business
 would
 be
 a
 digital


business
 and
 at
 that
 time
 to
 be
 a


digital
 business
 bu
 you
 had
 to
 be
 an


innovator
 and
 so
 we
 were
 able
 to


articulate
 that
 we
 wanted
 to
 keep
 the


culture
 that
 Embraces
 change
 in
 fact


that
 would
 enable
 us
 to
 embrace
 digital


but
 we
 had
 to
 change
 the
 culture
 that


was
 about
 being
 a
 fast
 follower
 the
 most


important
 thing
 I
 tell
 CEOs
 when
 they


say
 I
 need
 a
 cultural
 changes
 can
 you


articulate
 what
 you
 want
 to
 keep
 what


you
 need
 to
 change
 and
 what
 you
 need
 to


become
 and
 so
 we
 said
 we
 need
 to
 go
 move


from
 Fast
 follower
 to
 innovator
 I
 will


tell
 you
 Nikolai
 if
 you
 can
 just
 master


that
 you'll
 be
 able
 to
 change
 your


culture
 but
 what
 is
 the
 key
 so
 now
 you


come
 into
 a
 company
 do
 you
 you
 spend


time
 learning
 about
 the
 company
 learning


about
 the
 processes
 and
 so
 on
 and
 just


what
 do
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 attack


that
 kind
 of
 thing
 so
 how
 do
 if
 the


question
 is
 how
 do
 we
 help
 companies


change
 right
 we
 do
 it
 in
 a
 couple
 of


different
 ways
 so
 one
 we
 do
 have
 to


deeply
 understand
 the
 culture
 and
 you


know
 what
 we're
 walking
 into
 our
 top
 100


clients
 have
 been
 our
 clients
 for
 over


10
 years
 so
 many
 many
 of
 our
 clients


we've
 actually
 worked
 with
 for
 a
 very


long
 time
 and
 so
 part
 of
 what
 we
 often


bring
 is
 a
 deep
 knowledge
 of
 the
 company


but
 not
 always
 we
 have
 lots
 of
 new


clients
 as
 well
 so
 you
 do
 have
 to


understand
 that
 but
 the
 other
 piece
 is
 a


lot
 of
 what
 we're
 bringing
 our
 clients


along
 is
 things
 that
 other
 companies


have
 already
 done
 right
 so
 you're
 in
 a


consumer
 goods
 company
 consumer
 goods


companies
 face
 very
 similar
 cultural


issues
 like
 there's
 always
 the
 tension


between
 Global
 and
 and
 local
 markets
 for


example
 that's
 true
 in
 every
 consumer


goods
 company
 right
 so
 we
 bring
 a
 lot
 of


Industry
 expertise
 on
 both
 what
 are
 the


challenges
 what
 are
 the
 opportunities


and
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 clients
 come
 to
 us


for
 is
 that
 every
 Journey
 shouldn't
 be


bespoke
 right
 they
 want
 our
 help
 in


making
 sure
 that
 we
 can
 they
 can
 learn


from
 other
 companies
 lessons
 are
 you


surprised
 to
 which
 extent
 all
 the


companies
 are
 struggling
 with
 the
 same


things
 not
 surprised
 I
 think
 that
 um
 you


know
 like
 we
 I
 the
 more
 I
 do
 this
 the


more
 I
 say
 regardless
 of
 Industry
 people


are
 the
 same
 companies
 are
 the
 same
 uh


it's
 a
 great
 part
 of
 what
 we
 bring
 is


that
 Insight
 uh
 and
 so
 having
 now
 been


Global
 CEO
 for
 five
 years
 um
 not
 a
 lot


surprises


me
 strike
 me
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 people


generally
 don't
 particularly
 want
 to


share
 information
 they
 think
 a
 bit
 too


shortterm
 they
 think
 a
 bit
 too
 much
 on


themselves
 about
 themselves
 and
 uh
 your


job
 as
 a
 CO
 is
 kind
 of
 stretch
 the


company
 in
 different
 directions
 and


people
 in
 different
 directions
 but
 it


just
 seems
 like
 all
 companies
 are


struggling
 with
 the
 same
 things
 they
 all


talk
 about
 bidding
 down
 silos
 sharing


information
 I
 think
 um
 you're
 you're


absolutely
 right
 companies
 are
 facing


the
 same
 things
 I
 love
 that
 the
 example


of
 silos
 um
 they
 also
 all
 have
 terrible


data
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 the
 data


terrible
 data
 is
 because
 of
 the
 silos


right
 um
 and
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 because


companies
 grew
 up
 you
 know
 there
 was
 a


certain
 way
 of
 running
 companies
 right


so
 everybody's
 gone
 to
 that
 and
 what's


one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 think
 is
 hard


is
 having
 that
 culture
 of
 real
 innov


ation
 that's
 not
 about
 product
 but
 it's


about
 yourself
 right
 so
 most
 of
 the
 time


people
 think
 of
 innovation
 they
 think


about
 new
 Innovative
 products
 when
 was


the
 last
 time
 people
 were
 saying
 well
 I


want
 my
 finance
 function
 to
 be
 the
 most


Innovative
 Finance
 function
 I
 want
 to
 be


the
 way
 we
 operate
 and
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 what


we're
 trying
 to
 help
 companies
 do
 is
 to


understand
 that
 they
 need
 to
 reinvent


every
 aspect
 of
 what
 they
 do
 not
 just


have
 the
 most
 Innovative
 products
 but
 to


actually
 reinvent
 the
 way
 they're


working
 and
 the
 way
 they're
 operating


theirselves
 and
 the
 companies
 who


Embrace
 this
 idea
 of
 continuous


reinvention
 of
 everything
 that
 they're


doing
 that
 mindset
 are
 going
 to
 be
 the


ones
 that
 succeed
 in
 the
 next
 decade
 but


a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't
 particularly
 want


to


change
 yes
 and
 no
 I
 would
 say
 um
 one
 of


our
 leadership
 Essentials
 at
 Accenture


is
 the
 courage
 to
 change
 and
 the
 ability


to
 bring
 people
 along
 the
 journey
 and
 so


often
 times
 it's
 less
 about
 people
 not


wanting
 to
 to
 change
 and
 more
 about
 not


having
 the
 leadership
 that
 helps
 them


change
 and
 what
 the
 key
 to
 that


leadership
 now
 how
 are
 you
 so
 so
 now
 you


going
 to
 we
 work
 together
 how
 are
 you


going
 to
 get
 me
 to
 change
 so
 the
 first


thing
 is
 to
 have
 Clarity
 of
 where
 you


want
 to
 go
 and
 so
 what's
 the
 north
 star


the
 second
 is
 putting
 people
 first


meaning
 understanding
 how
 a
 person
 is


going
 to
 experience
 that
 change
 if
 I'm


telling
 you
 a
 North
 star
 that
 has


nothing
 to
 do
 like
 you're
 not
 going
 to


benefit
 from
 it
 you're
 part
 of
 the


Legacy
 business
 so
 you're
 not
 going
 to


the
 the
 best
 business
 that's
 not
 going


to
 be
 very
 compelling
 if
 we're
 asking


you
 to
 change
 and
 so
 Clarity
 of
 vision


and
 then
 the
 ability
 to
 understand
 how


each
 person's
 going
 to
 experience
 it
 and


then
 message
 to
 that
 person
 now
 you


mentioned
 Ai
 and
 and
 how
 you
 are
 helping


companies
 to
 change
 but
 how
 is
 it


changing
 Accenture
 it's
 changing
 every


part
 of
 Accenture
 um
 our
 strategy
 has


been
 three
 things
 first
 and
 foremost
 we


focused
 our
 investments
 we're
 investing


a
 billion
 dollars
 a
 year
 $3
 billion


total
 we
 focused
 our
 investments
 on


creating
 the
 solutions
 our
 clients
 need


because
 we
 knew
 right
 we
 needed
 to
 be


there
 for
 our
 clients
 the
 second
 part
 of


our
 strategy
 was
 to
 reimagine
 using
 AI


how
 we're
 delivering
 our
 services
 just


like
 we
 did
 with
 the
 last
 round
 of


intelligent
 automation
 we're
 embracing


it
 we're
 moving
 fast
 to
 say
 okay
 how
 do


we
 use
 this
 great
 technology
 to
 deliver


our
 services
 differently
 and
 then
 the


the
 third
 piece
 is
 how
 do
 we
 operate


ourselves
 differently
 in
 our
 corporate


functions
 and
 we
 are
 really
 clear
 about


our
 strategy
 and
 how
 we're
 investing


against
 that
 strategy
 so
 the
 1
 billion


How
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 spend
 it
 what
 is


it
 used
 for
 most
 of
 that
 is
 used
 for


either
 creating
 um
 new
 new
 services
 so


for
 example
 um
 we
 just
 announced
 a


partnership
 with
 Nvidia
 where
 we
 created


on
 top
 of
 their
 technology
 something


called
 an
 AI
 Refinery
 that
 actually


works
 on
 tops
 of
 their
 technology
 and


all
 of
 the
 different
 um


hyperscalers
 and
 that
 um
 is
 technology


so
 we
 had
 to
 invest
 to
 create
 that


solution
 which
 we
 can
 now
 deploy
 into


clients
 so
 we
 create
 assets
 and


solutions
 so
 our
 clients
 are
 not
 having


to
 do
 everything
 bespoke
 that's
 a
 big


part
 of
 our
 um
 investment
 another
 big


part
 of
 our
 investment
 is
 in
 training
 so


we
 are
 um
 creating
 we
 want
 to
 have


880,000
 data
 and
 AI
 um
 new
 data
 and
 AI


people
 total
 data
 and
 AI
 people
 by
 the


end
 of
 26
 we're
 already
 at
 uh
 57,000
 and


so
 there's
 a
 big
 investment
 in
 training


so
 those
 are
 two
 of
 the
 big
 areas
 and


there's
 some
 other
 areas
 as
 well
 how


long
 training
 program
 do
 they
 need
 to
 go


through
 uh
 it
 depends
 on
 um
 on
 the
 role


right
 so
 and
 what
 you
 start
 with
 so
 for


example
 last
 year
 we
 had
 about
 250,000


technology
 people
 take
 the
 first
 set
 of


intensive
 training
 that
 was
 between
 you


know
 15
 to
 20
 hours
 another
 130,000
 took


level
 two
 training
 which
 is
 like
 another


20
 hours
 depending
 on
 role
 and
 so
 what


we've
 done
 is
 to
 look
 rooll
 by
 roll
 and


say
 what
 are
 the
 data
 and
 AI
 skills
 that


are
 needed
 or
 who
 can
 we
 res
 skill
 to
 be


data
 and
 AI
 Specialists
 what
 are
 the


other
 things
 you're
 looking
 for
 in


Consultants
 who
 you
 hire
 so
 you


mentioned
 the
 ability
 to
 learn
 what
 are


the
 other
 things
 well
 just
 on
 the


ability
 to
 learn
 there's
 one
 question


that
 we
 ask
 everyone
 regardless
 of


you're
 a
 consultant
 or
 you're
 working
 in


technology
 or
 whatever
 you
 do
 we
 have
 a


lot
 of
 different
 skills
 at
 Accenture
 we


say
 what
 have
 you
 learned
 in
 the
 last


six
 months
 I
 share
 that
 with
 you
 because


a
 lot
 of
 times
 people
 are
 asking
 me
 well


how
 do
 I
 know
 if
 someone's
 a
 learner
 and


it's
 a
 very
 simple
 way
 to
 know
 if


someone
 can't
 answer
 that
 question
 right


and
 by
 the
 way
 we
 don't
 care
 if
 it's
 I


learned
 to
 b
 a
 cake
 right
 it's
 if
 they


can't
 answer
 that
 question
 then
 we
 know


that
 they're
 not
 a
 learner
 so
 I
 wanted


to
 share
 that
 because
 I
 you
 know
 people


are
 always
 looking
 for
 practical
 ways
 to


assess
 whether
 someone's
 really
 a


learning


no
 not
 unexpectedly
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 you


that
 question
 then
 so
 what
 have
 you


learned
 last
 six
 months
 what
 have
 I


learned
 in
 well
 I've
 so
 much
 about
 gen


I'm
 spending
 all
 of
 my
 time
 at
 work


learning
 completely
 about
 gen
 at
 home
 um


I'm
 doing
 a
 lot
 of
 baking
 I've
 never


been
 a
 big
 Baker
 but
 I
 am
 learning
 to


bake
 more
 do
 you
 bake
 bread
 as
 well
 I'm


not
 doing
 bread
 yet
 I'm
 doing
 um
 cakes


so
 okay
 well
 that's
 I
 make
 a
 really
 good


buttercake
 sounds
 good
 we'll
 uh
 bring


you
 next
 time
 yes
 um
 any
 other
 skills


which
 are
 important
 as
 a
 consultant
 in


terms
 of
 interpersonal
 skills
 just
 what


are
 what
 are
 what
 type
 of
 people
 are
 you


looking
 for
 so
 we're
 looking
 for
 um


people
 who
 are
 leaders
 and
 by
 leaders


I'm
 not
 saying
 I
 I
 want
 them
 to
 be
 like


the
 president
 of
 their
 class
 if
 they're


coming
 from
 college
 but
 to
 demonstrate


that
 they
 um
 work
 with
 others
 well
 that


they
 do
 get
 involved
 you
 know
 so
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 we
 look
 for
 are
 people


who
 who
 um
 actually
 have
 different


activities
 and
 again
 not
 that
 they


needed
 to
 be
 the
 president
 of
 the
 club


but
 because
 if
 the
 only
 thing
 you
 do
 say


a
 kid
 who
 come
 as
 school
 is
 to
 study
 and


get
 good
 grades
 you're
 unlikely
 to
 be


able
 to
 navigate
 the
 work
 um
 as
 well


what
 do
 you
 think
 is
 next
 after
 after
 AI


well
 first
 of
 all
 I
 think
 there's
 going


to
 be
 multiple
 versions
 of
 AI
 so
 Genai


you
 know
 is
 a
 big
 Trend
 today
 but
 we


already
 seeing
 different
 kinds
 of
 AI


that
 will
 come
 so
 I
 think
 the
 AI


Revolution
 will
 continue
 in
 waves
 I
 do


think
 that
 um
 Quantum
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


big
 you
 know
 part
 of
 um
 the
 technology


landscape
 probably
 more
 three
 to
 five


years
 out
 um
 but
 you
 know
 we're
 already


doing
 work
 in
 that
 so
 those
 are
 you
 know


two
 area
 sort
 of
 continued
 evolution
 of


AI
 and
 then
 Quantum
 and
 which
 Industries


are
 in
 your
 mind
 uh
 leading
 the


development
 here
 and
 which
 are
 lagging


well
 interestingly
 I
 think
 that
 every


single
 industry
 has
 leaders
 in
 them
 so


there's
 no
 industry
 where
 you
 say
 like


once
 like
 once
 upon
 a
 time
 you'd
 say


something
 like
 oil
 and
 gas
 was
 like


totally
 lagging
 because
 we're
 in
 the


middle
 of
 a
 digital
 Revolution
 and
 every


industry
 has
 leaders
 what
 we're
 seeing


is
 that
 every
 industry
 also
 has
 leaders


in
 embracing
 AI
 I
 do
 think
 though
 that


some
 of
 the
 usual
 suspects
 are
 not


embracing
 it
 as
 broadly
 so
 energy
 is
 a


sector
 that
 is
 lagging
 say
 what
 you're


seeing
 in
 um
 anything
 that's
 direct
 to


Consumer
 banking
 you
 know
 consumer
 goods


in
 the
 dtoc
 and
 Retail
 now
 um
 just
 a
 bit


more
 on
 on
 how
 you
 develop
 Talent
 so
 you


hire
 from
 universities
 we
 do
 both
 so
 we


hire
 from
 universities
 and
 we
 also
 do


experience
 tires
 yeah
 uh
 at
 all
 levels


so
 both
 managing
 directors
 and
 very


senior
 people
 and
 also
 sort
 of
 people


middle
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 their
 career
 and


how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 train
 them
 how


does
 a
 a
 a
 carrier
 path
 look
 like
 so
 a


couple
 of
 things
 that
 are
 important
 um


we
 spend
 over
 a
 billion
 dollars
 a
 year


on
 training
 so
 training
 um
 an
 employee


gets
 an
 average
 of
 44
 hours
 a
 year
 in


training
 so
 training
 um
 and
 Learning
 and


Development
 is
 something
 that
 is
 a
 part


of
 every
 year
 at
 Accenture
 we
 do
 have


what
 we
 call
 Core
 schools
 and
 core


schools
 are
 at
 different
 um
 key
 points


in
 your
 career
 so
 for
 example
 when
 you


you
 know
 are
 an
 analyst
 you
 have
 a


course
 school
 because
 you're
 you
 know


brand
 new
 when
 you're
 making
 when
 you


make
 managing
 director
 we
 have
 something


called
 MD
 momentum
 so
 and
 those
 core


schools
 that
 occur
 at
 different
 key


parts
 of
 the
 career
 are
 to
 get
 you
 ready


for
 the
 next
 stage
 of
 your
 career
 but


then
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 training


certifications
 gen
 we
 had
 500,000
 people


take
 our
 beginning
 gen
 course
 last
 year


um
 we
 had
 another
 300,000
 take
 the
 level


two
 course
 these
 are
 people
 other
 than


you
 know
 the
 ones
 who
 are
 deeply


technical
 so
 learning
 is
 really
 embedded


in
 everything
 we
 do
 let's
 um
 change
 t
 a


bit
 and
 talk
 about
 your
 leadership
 you


mentioned
 that
 you
 have
 these
 uh


programs
 where
 you
 map
 people's
 strength


what
 is
 your
 super
 strength
 uh
 strategy


so
 that's
 one
 of
 my
 super
 strengths
 and


uh
 achiever
 is
 one
 of
 my
 super
 strengths


and
 learner
 is
 one
 of
 my
 super
 strengths


so
 those
 are
 all
 in
 my
 top
 five
 okay
 and


and
 you
 were
 a
 lawyer
 by
 training
 I
 was


I
 I
 I'm
 still
 a
 lawyer
 so
 but
 yes
 I


trained
 as
 a
 lawyer
 what
 does
 that
 do
 to


you
 what
 does
 that
 does
 it
 does
 it
 help


you
 will
 hold
 you
 back
 I
 love
 being
 a


lawyer
 because
 um
 lawyers
 are
 trained
 to


process
 an
 amazing
 amount
 of
 information


in
 a
 short
 amount
 of
 time
 and
 then


they're
 asked
 to
 make
 a
 judgment
 and


when
 you
 think
 about
 being
 a
 CEO
 for


example
 at
 any
 given
 time
 I'm
 processing


a
 ton
 of
 information
 and
 I
 have
 to
 make


a
 decision
 right
 uh
 and
 so
 the
 legal


skills
 have
 allowed
 me
 both
 to
 be
 a
 good


just
 like
 the
 raw
 ability
 to
 process
 but


also
 to
 w
 rapidly
 and
 objectively
 you


know
 weigh
 the
 information
 in
 order
 to


make
 a
 good
 decision
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 one


of
 the
 best
 trainings
 uh
 especially
 now


with
 so
 much
 change
 that
 anyone
 could


have
 it's
 not
 the
 normal
 route
 to
 become


a
 CEO
 it
 is
 not
 the
 normal
 route
 it's


particularly
 in
 non-regulated
 Industries


you
 know
 we're
 not
 a
 regulated
 industry


um
 and
 I'm
 a
 big
 advocate
 of
 it
 however


a
 lot
 of
 people
 come
 up
 through
 the


finance
 way
 and
 CFOs
 and
 so
 on


surprising
 to
 you
 through
 HR
 yes
 yes
 HR


is
 uh
 increasingly
 important
 in
 fact
 uh


if
 you
 think
 about
 I
 think
 the
 best


thing
 to
 be
 right
 now
 one
 of
 the
 one
 of


the
 best
 Fields
 is
 to
 be
 in
 HR
 because


right
 after
 gen
 on
 CEO's
 agendas
 are
 is


talent
 and
 talent
 and
 how
 you
 train


Talent
 has
 to
 completely
 change
 what
 do


your
 HR
 director
 do
 differently
 than


other
 HR
 directors
 well
 um
 our
 HR
 is


skills-based
 HR
 so
 we
 have
 over
 700,000


people
 and
 we
 have
 a
 database
 of
 all
 of


their
 skills
 so
 for
 example
 in
 the


pandemic
 when
 um
 we
 suddenly
 needed
 a


lot
 more
 people
 who
 could
 do
 Cloud
 we


could
 run
 an
 algorithm
 and
 identify
 who


had
 adjacent
 skills
 who
 we
 could
 train


in
 just
 20
 hours
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 Cloud


work
 and
 we
 believe
 passionately
 that


all
 HR
 needs
 to
 be
 skills-based
 because


if
 you
 think
 about
 ai
 ai
 takes
 away


tasks
 not
 necessarily
 entire
 jobs
 and
 so


you
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 take
 someone


whose
 tasks
 have
 now
 been
 automated
 and


you
 know
 teach
 them
 new
 skills
 and
 um
 in


order
 to
 adapt
 and
 you
 got
 big
 numbers


so
 you
 can
 do
 HR
 analytics
 in
 a


different
 way
 than
 many
 other
 people


right
 yes
 we're
 extraordinarily
 data


driven
 so
 we
 really
 understand
 um
 our


people
 um
 what
 they're
 doing
 what
 their


interests
 are
 uh
 and
 most
 importantly


the
 data
 around
 skills
 what's
 the


coolest
 thing
 you
 can
 read
 out
 of
 your


analytics
 what's
 the
 coolest
 thing
 um
 we


have
 analytics
 that
 can
 predict
 if


someone
 is
 going
 to
 uh
 look
 for
 another


job
 what
 are
 the
 tell
 Tales
 uh
 there's
 a


bunch
 of
 them
 so
 there's
 like
 20


different
 variables
 that
 we
 look
 at
 and


it's
 incredibly
 accurate
 and
 we
 use
 that


to
 then
 make


interventions
 if
 we
 see
 that
 someone
 is


you
 know
 demonstrating
 um
 that
 is
 you


know
 it's
 being
 kick
 on
 the
 analytics


are
 saying
 is
 this
 person
 may
 be
 at
 risk


what
 do
 you
 do
 then
 um
 we
 make
 sure
 we


make
 no
 we
 make
 sure
 that
 there's


someone
 engaging
 with
 that
 person


they're
 checking
 in
 that
 they've
 got
 a


sponsor
 we
 we
 have
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 problem
 in


Europe
 because
 we
 have
 so
 strict
 gdpr


but
 you
 don't
 really
 have
 that
 problem


in
 the
 US
 we
 we
 have
 definitely


different
 rules
 so
 some
 of
 the
 tools


that
 we
 can
 use
 in
 the
 US
 we
 can't
 use


in
 Europe
 yeah
 now
 when
 you
 joined
 uh


you
 were
 the
 general
 Council
 right
 which


is
 kind
 of
 the
 you
 what
 would
 you
 say


it's
 like
 the
 head
 lawyer
 in
 The
 Firm


right
 yes
 how
 were
 you
 groomed
 to
 take


over
 the
 COO
 role
 what
 kind
 of
 guidance


mentorship
 did
 you
 get
 um
 I
 think
 there


were
 two
 pieces
 to
 that
 so
 one
 was
 the


guidance
 so
 the
 the
 CEO
 um
 the
 the
 about


a
 year
 after
 I
 started
 we
 had
 a
 new
 CEO


U
 pnm
 and
 he
 went
 out
 of
 his
 way
 to
 um


make
 sure
 that
 I
 understood
 why
 things


were
 the
 way
 they
 did
 and
 so
 um
 and
 he


was
 part
 of
 recruiting
 me
 he's
 actually


one
 of
 the
 people
 that
 interviewed
 me


but
 I
 think
 that
 in
 large
 part
 that
 was


a
 reaction
 to
 my
 own
 attitude
 which
 is
 I


follow
 something
 called
 the
 why
 rule


which
 is
 I
 started
 when
 I
 was
 a
 young


lawyer
 is
 that
 if
 I
 didn't
 understand


why
 something
 was
 happening
 why
 a
 client


said
 something
 why
 we
 gave
 certain


advice
 I
 would
 go
 back
 as
 a
 young
 lawyer


and
 ask
 the
 partner
 so
 when
 I
 joined


Accenture
 I
 did
 the
 same
 thing
 I
 would


sit
 in
 meetings
 and
 I
 would
 sometimes


sit
 there
 and
 say
 well
 like
 why
 did
 that


person
 say
 something
 why
 did
 why
 was


this
 decision
 made
 and
 then
 I
 would
 go


ask
 my
 colleagues
 so
 just
 I'm
 very


senior
 then
 you
 know
 so
 that
 was


different
 but
 the
 premise
 was
 the
 same


and
 I
 think
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that
 people


would
 go
 out
 of
 their
 way
 to
 explain
 to


me
 something
 oh
 Julie
 you
 may
 not


understand
 this
 because
 you
 weren't
 here


or
 you
 know
 you
 may
 not
 know
 this
 part


about
 the
 business
 and
 so
 you
 know
 one


of
 the
 things
 I
 talk
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 people


about
 in
 terms
 of
 career
 advice
 is
 that


the
 Y
 rule
 it
 makes
 sense
 whether
 you're


early
 in
 your
 career
 whether
 you're


taking
 on
 a
 new
 role
 or
 changing
 company


and
 then
 people
 respond
 to
 you
 being


genuinely
 caring
 about
 why
 when
 you
 uh


Mentor
 or
 are
 mentored
 by
 somebody
 how


often
 should
 you
 sit
 down
 together
 I


think
 that
 really
 depends
 on
 the
 person


and
 the
 role
 um
 some
 mentors
 like
 to


spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 you
 know
 others
 that


would
 be
 annoying
 and
 so
 I
 think
 um


what's
 most
 important
 when
 you're


seeking


mentorship
 is
 to
 be
 clear
 that
 what


you're
 trying
 to
 do
 is
 be
 able
 to
 create


more
 value
 for
 the
 company
 as
 opposed
 to


it's
 all
 about
 me
 and
 to
 be


genuinely
 connecting
 with
 someone
 and


seeking
 to
 learn
 from
 them
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 people
 make
 the
 mistake
 of
 thinking


like
 taus
 means
 you
 know
 you're
 going
 to


help
 me
 get
 the
 next
 job
 as
 opposed
 to


networking
 for
 value
 and
 people
 feel


appreciated
 when
 you
 go
 to
 them
 and


you're
 genuinely
 seeking
 to
 learn
 from


them
 can
 leadership
 be
 taught
 you
 think


I
 do
 think
 leadership
 could
 be
 taught
 it


was
 one
 of
 the
 eye
 openening
 things
 when


I
 came
 to
 Accenture
 so
 I
 came
 from
 a
 law


firm
 where
 we
 did
 no
 teaching
 on
 on


leadership
 we
 did
 a
 lot
 of
 other


teaching
 amazing
 training
 on
 how
 to
 be
 a


lawyer
 but
 the
 actual
 art
 of
 leadership


completely
 absent
 imagine
 I
 show
 up
 at


Accenture
 and
 you
 know
 as
 I
 said
 we


spend
 a
 billion
 dollars
 a
 year
 we
 do
 a


lot
 of
 leadership
 development
 and
 I


really
 began
 to
 appreciate
 that
 you


cannot
 expect
 to
 have
 great
 leaders
 if


you
 don't
 invest
 in
 helping
 train
 those


leaders
 but
 how
 do
 you
 train
 them
 a


couple
 of
 different
 ways
 one
 is
 on
 the


job
 training
 right
 you
 want
 we
 really


believe
 in
 the
 role
 of
 apprenticeship


and
 role
 modeling
 and
 so
 when
 we
 promote


leaders
 at
 every
 level
 we
 have
 something


called
 leadership
 Essentials
 which
 are


eight
 leadership
 Essentials
 and
 we
 use


those
 to
 look
 at
 whether
 or
 not
 the


leader
 we
 want
 to
 promote
 is
 actually
 a


role
 model
 for
 the
 skills
 and
 the


characteristics
 and
 mindsets
 that
 we


want
 for
 all
 of
 our
 leaders
 so
 it's


important
 that
 you're
 investing
 in


training
 you're
 making
 sure
 that
 your


words
 and
 your
 actions
 match
 so
 you're


promoting
 people
 with
 the
 leadership


characteristics
 so
 they
 can
 be
 Role


Models
 um
 and
 that
 you're
 providing
 that


sort
 of
 on
 the
 job
 training
 for


leadership
 as
 well
 when
 you
 look
 at
 your


own
 leadership
 how
 has
 that
 developed
 I


think
 I've
 how
 did
 you
 find
 yourself
 as


a
 leader
 what
 are
 your
 how
 how
 are
 you


as
 a
 leader
 well
 I
 you
 know
 I
 think
 I'm


pretty
 good
 uh
 so
 I'm
 always
 room
 for


improvement
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 that
 uh
 of


our
 eight
 leadership
 Essentials
 there's


one
 that
 I
 particularly
 introduced
 that


I
 think
 has
 been
 very
 important
 in
 my


own
 um
 growth
 and
 it
 is
 lead
 with


Excellence
 confidence
 and
 humility
 and


Leaders
 with
 humility
 are
 Learners
 they


create
 good
 teams
 because
 they
 recognize


they
 don't
 have
 all
 of
 the
 answers
 and


they're
 willing
 to
 challenge
 themselves


and
 change
 and
 when
 I
 think
 about
 my


leadership
 style
 I
 do
 really
 try
 to


emulate
 that
 idea
 of
 Excellence


confidence
 and
 humility
 to
 which
 extent


are
 you
 stronger
 now
 as
 a
 leader
 than


you
 were
 five
 years
 ago
 well
 a
 couple
 of


things
 skills
 wise
 I
 work
 a
 lot
 about
 on


communication
 and
 one
 of
 the
 advice
 that


I
 give
 um
 all
 leaders
 at
 every
 level
 is


that
 you
 can
 have
 the
 best
 ideas
 in
 the


world
 but
 if
 you
 do
 not
 clearly


communicate
 them
 in
 ways
 that
 people


want
 to
 listen
 then
 you
 will
 not
 have
 an


impact
 and
 so
 I
 work
 very
 hard
 at
 being


an
 impactful
 communicator
 and
 so
 I
 think


I've
 continued
 to
 develop
 that
 and
 then


secondly
 you
 know
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the


last
 five
 years
 right
 they've
 been
 very


challenging
 years
 and
 I
 think
 I've
 grown


as
 a
 leader
 in
 being
 able
 to
 just


balance
 right
 that
 things
 you
 know


there's
 tough
 times
 and
 there
 are
 good


times
 and
 it's
 really
 important
 to
 be


able
 to
 um
 understand
 that
 uh
 things
 are


as
 once
 someone
 once
 said
 you
 never
 as


bad
 as
 they
 seem
 and
 Never
 As
 Good
 as


they
 seem
 and
 that
 creates
 a
 more
 of
 a


long-term
 uh
 view
 um
 and
 and
 less


volatility
 in
 leadership
 what
 do
 you


think
 is
 key
 to
 good
 communication


storytelling
 y
 uh
 so
 I
 I
 uh
 there's
 a


great
 book
 that
 I
 recommend
 to
 everyone


I
 should
 get
 I
 should
 get
 a
 cut
 of
 it
 um


it's
 by
 a
 good
 friend
 of
 mine
 Andy
 Craig


called
 weekend
 language
 it's
 very
 good
 I


love
 it
 that's
 great
 I
 I
 love
 that
 you


read
 it
 um
 and
 it
 really
 changed
 my


communication
 style
 because
 people


remember
 stories
 right
 that's
 the
 way


that
 you
 have
 impact
 and
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 if
 they
 don't
 remember
 what
 you


say
 you
 can't
 have
 an
 impact
 so
 the
 book


is
 about
 how
 funny
 and
 interesting


people
 are
 during
 the
 weekend
 when
 they


are
 in
 dinner
 parties
 and
 that
 kind
 of


thing
 and
 they
 have
 anecdotes
 and


details
 and
 all
 the
 interesting
 things


and
 people
 off
 and
 then
 you
 come
 into


the
 office
 on
 one
 day
 and
 they
 are
 so


boring
 and
 there
 is
 something
 called
 the


professional


curse
 what
 is
 that
 that
 you
 just
 are


dull
 right
 because
 you're
 so


professional
 and
 you
 use
 long
 sentences


and
 difficult
 words
 and
 nobody
 really


exactly
 is
 hooked
 on
 what
 you
 say
 and


you
 know
 the
 book
 talks
 about
 how
 you


win
 or
 lose
 people
 in
 the
 first
 two


minutes
 yeah
 and
 I
 think
 about
 that
 all


of
 the
 time
 I
 think
 about
 it
 in
 a
 short


conversation
 I
 think
 about
 it
 in
 a


presentation
 um
 because
 you
 know
 it's
 so


human
 right
 and
 we
 we've
 all
 been
 there


that
 you
 know
 oh
 my
 God
 that
 person
 is


so
 dry
 you
 know
 so
 how
 do
 you
 train


people
 in
 the
 organization
 so
 all


everybody
 in
 the
 Accenture
 are
 just


running
 around
 telling
 stories
 being


funny
 and
 Charming
 so
 it's
 interesting


we
 have
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 training
 of
 our


leaders
 on
 um
 weekend
 language
 we


actually
 use
 end
 as
 a
 coach
 and
 now
 what


we're
 developing
 really
 as
 a
 result
 of


the
 age
 of
 AI
 is
 we're
 going
 to
 build
 in


more
 structured
 communication
 training


starting
 as
 a
 young
 analyst
 and
 the


reason
 for
 that
 is
 that
 as
 AI
 augments


people
 and
 allows
 them
 to
 do
 things
 you


know
 sort
 of
 earlier
 in
 their
 career


right
 because
 it's
 that's
 kind
 of
 giving


them
 superpowers
 what
 it
 doesn't
 do
 is


um
 give
 you
 that
 time
 back
 that
 that
 you


need
 for
 apprenticeship
 and
 learning
 and


so
 we
 believe
 that
 we
 need
 to
 focus
 on


communication
 skills
 earlier
 in
 the


career
 and
 so
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 we're
 working
 on
 now
 um
 really
 as
 a


direct
 result
 of
 how
 we
 think
 the


workforce
 is
 going
 to
 be
 impacted
 for
 AI


and
 that
 we
 need
 better
 communication


skills
 earlier
 now
 do
 you
 think
 this
 was


related
 to
 you
 did
 debating
 um
 you
 were


on
 a
 debating
 team
 when
 you
 were
 at


school
 right
 I
 did
 both
 speech
 and


debate
 and
 I
 absolutely
 built
 an


incredible
 foundation
 and
 if
 there's
 any


young
 students
 who
 are
 listening


listening
 to
 this
 podcast
 they
 should


absolutely
 do
 speech
 and
 debate
 I
 agree


entirely
 Julia
 why
 is
 storytelling
 more


important
 now
 than
 before
 we're
 in
 such


a
 time
 of
 change
 that
 um
 most
 of
 the


companies
 I'm
 working
 with
 what
 they're


talking
 to
 me
 about
 is
 how
 do
 I
 help
 my


people
 change
 you
 know
 how
 do
 you
 help


me
 with
 change
 management
 and
 so


effective
 communication
 being
 able
 to


reach
 people
 emotionally
 um
 have
 them


really
 understand
 what
 you're
 trying
 to


do
 is
 absolutely
 critical
 and


storytelling
 is
 all
 about
 that
 in
 fact


we
 actually
 bought
 a
 company
 called
 the


storytellers
 uh
 that
 it
 built
 their


entire
 company
 around
 storytelling
 and


change
 management
 so
 I
 I
 I
 highly


recommend
 to
 CEOs
 that
 they
 invest
 in


capabilities
 around
 change
 management


around
 storytelling
 in
 order
 to
 bring


their
 people
 along
 the
 journey
 what's


the
 key
 to
 good
 storytelling
 the
 key


need
 a
 good
 story
 telling
 uh
 having
 a


story
 to
 tell
 right
 so
 that
 starts
 uh


keeping
 it
 short
 y
 uh
 and
 not
 using
 any


Consulting
 language
 okay
 so
 they
 use


your
 Consultants
 to
 make
 sure
 they
 don't


use
 Consulting
 language
 well
 it's
 it's


so
 important
 to
 be
 and
 you
 know
 it's
 not


just
 about
 Consultants
 right
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 I
 see
 across
 industry
 is


that
 people
 fall
 into
 jargon
 of
 whatever


their
 interest
 of
 their
 industry
 is
 and


even
 if
 you
 understand
 the
 jargon
 that


is
 not
 compelling
 and
 that's
 why
 it's
 so


important
 regardless
 of
 Industry
 to


really
 get
 away
 from
 jargon
 and
 tell


stories
 plainly
 and
 authentically
 that's


how
 you
 reach
 people
 and
 how
 does
 this


impact
 the
 way
 you
 communicate


internally
 well
 I
 start
 usually
 when
 I'm


doing
 a
 presentation
 I
 always
 I
 think


about
 um
 two
 things
 I
 think
 about
 the


first
 two
 minutes
 so
 how
 is
 that
 going


to
 go
 and
 I
 think
 about
 what's
 the


stories
 that
 I
 want
 to
 tell
 to


illustrate
 the
 points
 um
 and
 I
 do
 that


in
 a
 very
 structured
 way
 because
 I
 know


that
 if
 I
 could
 I
 can
 give
 a
 beautiful


speech
 and
 I
 can
 be
 very
 logical
 about


the
 new
 strategy
 but
 if
 I
 do
 not
 bring


it
 to
 life
 they
 will
 not
 remember
 it'll


be
 blah
 blah
 blah
 and
 if
 I
 don't
 grab


people
 in
 the
 first
 two
 minutes
 they


won't
 even
 listen
 and
 do
 you
 you
 use


videos
 internally
 I
 use
 a
 lot
 of
 videos


in
 internally
 so
 we're
 sitting
 here
 in


uh
 you
 know
 in
 your
 studio
 basically
 yes


we
 have
 a
 broadcast
 studio
 it's
 awesome


we
 we
 do
 it
 so
 much
 we
 have
 it
 in
 uh


many
 of
 our
 offices
 yeah
 now
 one
 of
 the


things
 we
 should
 they
 recommend
 in
 the


uh
 weekend
 language
 is
 not
 to
 use


PowerPoint
 you
 know
 I
 am
 determined
 that


someday
 we
 will
 eliminate
 PowerPoint
 at


Accenture
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 I
 will
 tell
 you


that
 today
 on
 my
 finance
 meeting
 so
 like


when
 I'm
 doing
 a
 you
 know
 a
 quarterly


review
 we
 have
 we
 use
 something
 called


the
 Enterprise
 Navigator
 so
 we
 bring
 up


in
 real
 time
 our
 financial
 data
 no


PowerPoints
 uh
 so
 we're
 we're
 taking


baby
 steps
 uh
 to
 getting
 away
 from


PowerPoints
 why
 that
 bad
 because
 they


become
 crutches
 right
 um
 they
 you
 know


people
 then
 are
 reading
 the
 Powerpoints


there
 um
 you're
 there's
 no
 stories
 on


PowerPoints
 right
 so
 when
 I
 go
 to
 a


client
 meeting
 I
 will
 you
 know
 almost


never
 use
 slides
 I
 I've
 actually
 had


clients
 say
 no
 you
 must
 bring
 slides


where
 slide
 culture
 right
 um
 because
 I


want
 to
 connect
 with
 people
 and
 to
 be


able
 to
 communicate
 with
 them
 and
 people


don't
 communicate
 by
 slides
 if
 you
 had


to
 bring
 a
 slide
 what
 would
 it
 look
 like


what
 does
 a
 good
 slide
 look
 like
 in
 your


world
 uh
 very
 simple
 so
 should
 have
 you


know
 very
 simple
 Graphics
 that
 you


actually
 know
 what
 they
 mean
 we
 are


famous
 in
 Consulting
 land
 for
 having


Graphics
 that
 do
 not
 make
 sense
 at
 first


glance
 and
 so
 you
 you
 know
 we
 have
 to


explain
 them
 in
 very
 few
 words
 and
 big


fonts
 and
 big


fonts
 I
 read
 a
 book
 which
 said
 that
 well


which
 there
 is
 research
 showing
 that
 uh


if
 you
 have
 bigger
 fonts
 it
 gives
 more


trust
 you
 trust
 more
 a
 person
 who
 has


called
 big
 fonts
 on
 the
 slide
 that
 I


have
 not
 heard
 I'm
 going
 to
 remember


that
 now
 um
 I
 um
 read
 somewhere
 that
 you


have
 a
 plaque
 at
 home
 which
 says
 if
 your


dreams
 don't
 scare
 you
 they
 are
 not
 big


enough
 that's
 right
 so
 roughly
 two
 years


before
 I
 became
 the
 global
 CEO
 when
 I


knew
 I
 was
 you
 know
 up
 for
 being
 the
 CEO


my
 husband
 comes
 home
 one
 day
 with
 three


plaques
 and
 he
 always
 likes
 these
 sort


of
 kitchy
 sayings
 and
 that
 and
 he
 and


these
 were
 really
 not
 attractive
 plaques


and
 he
 wants
 to
 hang
 them
 in
 our
 house


to
 inspire
 our
 daughters
 and
 you
 know


after
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 tussle
 I
 said
 finally


you
 can
 hang
 them
 at
 the
 back
 of
 a
 house


in
 our
 mudro
 and
 he
 got
 the
 last
 laugh


because
 one
 of
 them
 says
 if
 your
 dreams


don't
 scare
 you
 they're
 not
 big
 enough


and
 you
 know
 during
 those
 couple
 of


years
 when
 you
 know
 here
 I
 was
 I
 was
 you


know
 the
 general
 counsel
 you
 know
 trying


to
 become
 the
 CEO
 I
 mean
 I
 at
 that
 time


I'd
 worked
 as
 a
 North
 America
 CEO
 but


that's
 a
 big
 you
 know
 leap
 as
 you
 said


I'm
 the
 first
 CEO
 that
 didn't
 start
 out


of
 college
 so
 you
 know
 at
 times
 it


seemed
 like
 a
 very
 really
 big
 long
 shot


and
 so
 it
 was
 comforting
 to
 say
 well


it's
 not
 that
 I'm
 not
 able
 to
 do
 it
 it's


not
 that
 I'm
 not
 qualified
 it's
 just


that
 I'm
 dreaming
 big
 that
 I
 feel
 a


little
 bit
 scared
 about
 whether
 I
 was


going
 to
 make
 it
 um
 and
 I
 I
 use
 that
 now


when
 I
 think
 about
 how
 to
 run
 a
 company


right
 because
 because
 if
 as
 a
 leader
 as


a
 CEO
 if
 you're
 complacent
 if
 you're
 not


worried
 about
 whether
 your
 strategy
 is


going
 to
 work
 then
 chances
 are
 you're


not
 pushing
 the
 company
 and
 you're
 going


to
 wake
 up
 and
 find
 yourself
 behind
 and


similarly
 you
 know
 I
 try
 to
 tell
 people


that
 when
 you're
 whether
 it's
 a
 young


person
 taking
 a
 new
 job
 or
 someone


mid-career
 moving
 jobs
 or
 moving


companies
 right
 the
 fact
 that
 you're


nervous
 doesn't
 mean
 you're
 not


qualified
 it
 just
 means
 you're
 dreaming


big
 that's
 a
 much
 more
 inspiring
 uh
 way


to
 think
 about
 the
 moves
 you're
 making


when
 were
 you
 last
 nervous
 I
 am
 nervous


absolutely
 every
 day
 because
 we
 are


pushing
 ourselves
 right
 we
 are
 operating


at
 the
 edge
 of
 Technology
 right
 and
 you


know
 our
 clients
 want
 us
 to
 have
 a


healthy
 dose
 of
 humility
 which
 is
 what
 I


think
 about
 when
 you're
 saying
 nervous


right
 the
 humility
 to
 say
 I
 need
 to
 be


extra
 careful
 I
 need
 to
 recognize
 that


we're
 doing
 Cutting
 Edge
 work
 and
 I
 need


to
 put
 in
 place
 you
 know
 and
 and
 and


really
 be
 mindful
 right
 and
 humble
 that


this
 stuff's
 hard
 now
 we
 got
 several


things
 in
 common
 one
 thing
 is
 that
 we


both
 had
 mothers
 who
 studied
 When
 We


Were
 Young
 oh
 that's
 wonderful
 what
 did


your
 mom
 study
 she
 studied
 art
 history


and
 uh
 a
 few
 things
 related
 to
 that


that's
 great
 and
 you
 did
 too
 yes
 my
 mom


graduated
 my
 freshman
 year
 in
 college


she's
 super
 inspiring
 yeah
 in
 what
 ways


she's
 inspiring
 spiring
 because
 at
 that


time
 right
 so
 this
 was
 in


1985
 uh
 you
 know
 there
 weren't
 a
 lot
 of


women
 in
 college
 certainly
 mothers
 in


college
 um
 she
 was
 working
 part-time
 she


had
 three
 kids
 and
 uh
 she
 had
 grown
 up


on
 a
 farm
 so
 completely
 different


environment
 uh
 and
 she
 you
 know
 went
 to


school
 there
 was
 not
 many
 people
 who


were
 her
 age
 there
 let
 alone
 women
 uh


and
 she
 just
 went
 after
 her
 dreams
 and


didn't
 let
 anything
 stop
 her
 and
 that's


very
 inspiring
 when
 people
 ask
 me
 how


they
 should
 spend
 that
 money
 I
 I
 tell


them
 they
 should
 spend
 a
 lot
 on
 their


mothers
 I
 agree
 absolutely
 you
 also


studied
 in
 China
 right
 I
 did
 so
 I
 you


know
 my
 parents
 didn't
 even
 own
 a


passport
 and
 I
 went
 home
 one
 day
 when
 I


was
 a
 senior
 in
 uh
 Co
 in
 high
 school
 and


said
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 study
 Chinese
 and
 I


ended
 up
 spending
 a
 year
 between
 Taiwan


and
 Beijing
 and
 it
 was
 an
 amazing
 very


transformation
 experience
 in
 what
 ways


it
 was
 the
 first
 time
 I
 was
 in
 a
 place


where
 I
 didn't
 look
 like
 everyone
 else


and
 I
 didn't
 speak
 the
 language
 you
 know


I
 was
 still
 studying
 you
 know
 like
 two


years
 of
 Chinese
 underneath
 my
 belt
 uh


and
 so
 I
 had
 to
 demonstrate
 a
 lot
 of


resilience
 um
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 needed


to
 navigate
 I
 didn't
 have
 a
 safety
 net


back
 then
 I'm
 really
 you
 know
 I'm
 57
 so


back
 then
 there
 were
 no
 cell
 phones


right
 uh
 there
 was
 not
 sort
 of
 the
 easy


button
 and
 uh
 and
 it
 also
 just
 taught
 me


to
 look
 at
 things
 very
 differently


because
 I
 was
 you
 know
 navigating
 I
 was


The
 Stranger
 in
 another
 culture
 and
 it


helped
 me
 be
 able
 to
 put
 myself
 in


different
 people's
 shoes
 and
 made
 me


more
 empathetic
 as
 a
 person
 how
 do
 you


relax
 when
 you
 AR
 at
 work
 I
 spend
 time


with
 my
 daughters
 I
 have
 two
 teenage


daughters
 who
 I
 love
 and
 they
 are
 so


much
 fun
 to
 be
 with
 and
 that's
 really


you
 know
 for
 me
 family
 time
 is
 um
 how
 I


relax
 how
 really
 love
 to
 spend
 my
 time


when
 I'm
 not
 working
 and
 that's
 why
 you


bake
 your
 cakes
 yes
 although
 um
 they


really
 like
 my
 chocolate
 chip
 cookies


right
 and
 what
 do
 you
 read
 I
 tend
 to


read
 um
 like
 just
 uh
 Mur
 not
 murder


mysteries
 but
 like
 terrorism
 type
 books


you
 know
 like
 David
 bichi
 um
 uh
 I
 like


kind
 of
 Escape
 not
 particularly
 highbrow


you
 know
 fiction
 that
 is
 really
 fun


sounds
 good
 now
 we
 got
 tens
 of
 thousands


of
 young
 people
 listening
 to
 uh
 to
 this


what
 advice
 would
 you
 give
 them
 two


things
 um
 one
 of
 them
 is
 to
 live
 by
 this


idea


of
 lead
 your
 life
 with
 Excellence


confidence
 and


humility
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 so
 important


you
 know
 I
 learned
 that
 from
 my
 dad
 and


my
 dad
 painted
 cars
 for
 a
 living
 and
 he


always
 believed
 that
 you
 know
 we
 could


do
 anything
 that
 we
 set
 our
 mind
 to
 do


and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 he
 was
 always
 very


Frank
 when
 you
 know
 we
 weren't
 really
 in


leading
 with
 Excellence
 where
 we
 weren't


performing
 with
 excellence
 and
 so
 I


think
 it's
 important
 to
 balance
 those


two
 things
 and
 to
 have
 the
 humility
 to


know
 what
 you
 don't
 know
 um
 to
 learn


from
 others
 and
 to
 build
 great
 teams
 I


think
 that's
 just
 super
 important
 the


second
 piece
 is
 um
 to
 think
 about
 your


life
 in
 a
 way
 to
 not
 have
 any
 regrets


you
 know
 I
 had
 breast
 cancer
 um
 when
 I
 I


was
 47
 and
 I
 had
 two
 young
 kids
 at
 the


time
 and
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 taught


me
 was
 that
 you
 know
 life
 can
 change


very
 quickly
 and
 I
 have
 this
 like


barometer
 in
 the
 way
 I
 live
 my
 life


where
 I'll
 stop
 and
 I'll
 say
 if


tomorrow
 you
 know
 I
 was
 diagnosed
 again


with
 cancer
 I
 faced
 some
 kind
 of


life-threatening
 illness
 would
 I
 have


regrets
 about
 how
 I'm
 living
 my
 life


right
 now
 and
 sometimes
 the
 answer
 is


yes
 like
 you
 know
 I've
 committed
 to
 Too


Much
 travel
 I'm
 away
 from
 my
 family
 and


other
 times
 it's
 no
 like
 I'm
 I've
 got


the
 right
 balance
 but
 it's
 important
 to


ask
 the
 question
 right
 now
 I'm
 always


cautious
 to
 say
 like
 if
 you're
 a
 young


person
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 work


really
 hard
 okay
 like
 so
 yes
 you
 know


it's
 not
 about
 like
 not
 working
 hard
 but


it's
 about
 making
 sure
 that
 you're
 kind


of
 looking
 at
 your
 life
 in
 the
 whole
 uh


and
 uh
 and
 you
 know
 it's
 something
 that


I've
 learned
 and
 I'd
 like
 to
 share
 thank


you
 well
 thanks
 for
 sharing
 and
 for
 sure


it
 looks
 like
 you
 have
 uh
 lived
 up
 to
 uh


your
 own
 advice
 of
 Excellence
 confidence


and
 humility
 and
 a
 big
 thanks
 for
 being


here
 today
 well
 thank
 you
 very
 much


thank
 you
