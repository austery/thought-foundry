 Well,
 Big
 Aon
 uh
 is
 a
 big


market
 story
 as
 well
 today.
 Once
 again


driving
 the
 trade,
 pushing
 semi
 as
 a


group,
 semiconductors
 that
 is
 hired


today,
 led
 by
 Broadcom,
 whose
 stock


jumped
 after
 OpenAI
 agreed
 to
 buy
 the


company's
 custom
 chips
 and
 networking


equipment
 in
 a
 multi-year
 deal,
 part
 of


an
 ambitious
 plan
 by
 the
 startup
 to
 add


AI
 infrastructure.
 So,
 we
 wanted
 to
 just


dig
 a
 little bit
 deeper
 into
 it.
 Amy


talked
 about
 it.
 We
 certainly
 are
 seeing


it
 playing
 out
 in
 the
 market.
 Got
 a


great
 voice
 though,
 Belly
 to
 walk
 us


through
 it.


>> One
 of
 my
 favorite
 people.
 I
 will
 say


>> Billy
 must
 have
 said
 Mandep's
 name
 about


five
 times
 on
 the
 call
 this
 morning.


>> Immediately
 was
 like
 we
 need
 to
 get
 him


in
 studio.
 So
 perfect
 timing.
 And
 that's


why
 we're
 joined
 now
 by
 Bloomberg


Intelligence
 global
 head
 of
 technology


research
 Mandep
 Singh
 here
 in
 the


studio.
 Mandep,
 walk
 us
 through
 this


deal
 because
 it
 feels
 like
 every
 other


day
 OpenAI
 has
 a
 new
 agreement
 with
 some


chip
 manufacturer
 and
 the
 terms
 are


slightly
 different
 whether
 it's
 an


ownership
 stake
 or
 front
 buying
 chips.


What's
 up
 with
 uh
 this
 broad
 compact?


>> I
 mean
 they
 are
 really
 going
 after
 uh


you
 know
 data
 center
 capacity
 right
 now


and
 the
 way
 they
 are
 doing
 it
 is
 by


diversifying
 their
 supplier
 base.
 So


it's
 not
 just
 relying
 on
 Nvidia
 which


everyone
 does
 right
 now
 uh
 for
 compute


but
 really
 uh
 leveraging
 Broadcom
 which


is
 a
 custom
 silicon
 maker.
 So
 think


about
 you
 know
 Nvidia
 giving
 you
 a


generic
 chip
 where
 you
 can
 run
 your
 AI


workloads
 whether
 it's
 training
 or


inferencing.
 Custom
 silicon
 is
 used
 just


for
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 specific
 workflow


that
 open
 AI
 has
 to
 run
 for
 its


proprietary
 model.
 So
 no
 one
 else
 has


any
 benefit
 of
 using
 a
 custom
 silicon


because
 OpenAI
 is
 not
 looking
 to
 sell


its
 own
 chips
 to
 compete
 with
 Nvidia.


It's
 looking
 to
 use
 its
 chips
 for
 its


own
 cha
 chip
 app
 or
 any
 other
 custom
 app


that
 it
 has
 developed
 in-house.
 And


Google
 is
 a
 prime
 example
 of
 what
 a


custom
 silicon
 looks
 like
 because
 they


have
 their
 own
 TPUs,
 which
 when
 you


compare
 it
 to
 Nvidia
 GPUs
 is
 more


customized
 in
 nature,
 but
 it
 does
 a


terrific
 job
 of
 running
 YouTube
 or
 any


other
 AI
 workloads
 that
 Google
 wants
 to


run
 on
 its
 chip.
 So
 that's
 what
 Open
 AI


is
 doing.
 And
 it
 has
 a
 tremendous
 cost


advantage
 because
 it
 costs
 a
 lot
 lower


than
 the
 Nvidia
 price
 tag
 of
 $30,000
 on


an
 average
 for
 a
 GPU.
 TPU,
 tensor


processing
 unit.
 I
 just
 want
 to
 make


sure
 I
 understand.
 Um,
 what's


interesting
 though
 is
 I
 do
 feel
 like


there's
 this
 move
 trend
 to
 get
 chips


that
 maybe
 don't
 cost
 as
 much,
 maybe


don't
 use
 as
 much
 power,
 but
 do
 exactly


what
 we
 need.
 Is
 that
 fair?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 one
 one
 gawatt


requires
 up
 to
 500
 to
 600,000


accelerator
 chips.
 So,
 we're
 talking.5


to6
 million
 chips
 for
 1
 gawatt
 data


center.
 Imagine
 if
 you
 can
 save
 up
 to


$5,000


how
 it
 multiplies,
 you
 know,
 in
 terms
 of


cost
 savings.
 The
 real
 constraint
 right


now
 is
 power.
 It's
 not
 as
 if
 you
 get
 a


cheaper
 chip
 and
 you
 are
 all
 good.
 You


still
 need
 the
 performance
 per
 watt,


which
 is
 why
 Nvidia
 is
 so
 good
 because


it
 gives
 you
 5
 to
 10x
 more
 performance


per
 watt
 than
 the
 nearest
 competitor.


>> Right.


>> Exactly.
 I
 want
 to
 show
 there's
 a


graphic
 um
 and
 uh
 one
 of
 our
 producers


made
 it
 Elizabeth
 Cedron
 and
 I
 think
 it


you
 know
 we've
 all
 been
 looking
 at
 this.


It's
 about
 OpenAI
 and
 all
 of
 the


companies
 that
 they're
 doing
 deals
 with


and
 it's
 not
 even
 been
 a
 month
 but
 they


have
 done
 deals
 with
 Nvidia,
 Oracle,


Corewave,
 AMD
 now
 Broadcom
 and
 again


it's
 just
 late
 September
 to
 mid
 October.


So
 is
 that
 what
 this
 is?
 Is
 just
 giving


them
 a
 smarter
 supply
 chain
 and
 having


access
 to
 what
 they
 need?
 Is
 it
 as


simple
 as
 that?


>> Well,
 it's
 not
 as
 simple
 because
 they're


going
 across
 the
 stack.
 So,
 think
 of,


you
 know,
 how
 AI
 applications
 are


deployed.
 You
 need
 the
 chip,
 you
 need


the
 infrastructure,
 you
 need
 the
 cloud


because
 that's
 where
 you're
 doing
 your


inferencing.
 So,
 they've
 cut
 deals
 with


different
 parts
 of
 the
 stack
 here,
 not


just
 the
 chip
 makers,
 not
 just
 the
 power


guys,
 uh
 also
 the
 cloud
 guys.
 So,
 from


that
 perspective,


>> coreweave,
 right?


>> Corewave.
 Exactly.
 And
 and
 look
 uh
 I


mean
 to
 my
 mind
 they
 are
 going
 uh


aggressive
 in
 terms
 of
 adding
 more


capacity
 than
 they
 probably
 need
 because


they
 think
 if
 they
 get
 market
 share
 they


get
 the
 companies
 or
 users
 to
 use
 their


product
 then
 they
 will
 be
 able
 to


monetize
 and
 probably
 drive
 some


companies
 out
 of
 you
 know
 competing
 with


them
 because
 of
 the
 scale
 involved
 here.


>> Well
 are
 are
 XAI
 and
 Anthropic
 striking


similar
 deals
 or
 is
 this
 the
 open
 AI


show?
 I
 I
 think
 right
 now
 XAI
 must
 be


thinking
 and
 they
 are
 doing
 a
 $20


billion
 deal
 uh
 with
 some
 private


financing.
 But
 look,
 when
 OpenAI


announces
 a
 10
 gawatt
 deal,
 we're


talking
 500
 billion,
 not
 20
 billion


anymore.
 So
 it's
 the
 numbers
 are
 getting


bigger
 and
 bigger.


>> Well,
 is
 OpenAI
 in
 this
 moment
 in
 time


on
 October
 13th
 the
 most
 important


company
 in
 the
 world?


>> Well,
 when
 I
 look
 at
 Mag
 7,
 your


Broadcom
 is
 not
 in
 MAG7.
 It's
 a
 $1.6
 6


trillion
 company,
 you
 know,
 Open
 AI


probably,
 you
 know,
 it's
 what


>> and
 they're
 up
 10%
 because
 of
 this.
 I


mean,
 also
 they
 the
 whole
 space
 sold
 off


on
 Friday,
 so
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 downplay


that
 too
 much,
 but
 like


>> they're
 not
 even
 public.
 They're
 not


even
 profitable
 as
 much
 as
 we
 know,


right?


>> No,
 I
 mean
 look,
 so
 right
 now
 their


gross
 margins
 would
 be
 negative
 if
 you


factor
 in
 their
 training
 costs.


Inferencing
 wise,
 yes,
 they
 they
 they


are
 making
 some
 money,
 but
 clearly
 if


you
 include
 everything
 and
 just
 to


compare
 it
 with
 Google,
 Google
 has
 an


annual
 cost
 of
 revenue
 of
 around
 100


billion
 that
 powers
 all
 of
 their
 apps,


you
 know,
 Google,
 YouTube,
 everything


that
 they
 run.
 Open
 AAI's
 compute
 costs


are
 probably
 north
 of
 20
 billion
 right


now.
 And
 if
 they're
 adding
 26
 gawatt


more
 capacity,
 we're
 talking
 you
 know
 uh


compute
 cost
 to
 multiply
 at least


25fold.
 So
 from
 that
 perspective,
 you


have
 to
 ask
 yourself
 how
 much


incremental
 revenue
 do
 you
 want
 to
 see


from
 open
 AI
 to
 justify
 this,
 you
 know,


1
 trillion
 potentially
 $1
 trillion
 in


compute
 infrastructure
 spend.
 And
 that's


where
 Google's
 infrastructure
 is
 so


efficient
 because
 just
 you
 know
 less


than
 5
 gawatt
 of
 compute
 gets
 you
 to


over
 400
 billion
 in
 revenue.


>> That's
 pretty
 cool,
 you
 know,


>> to
 say
 the
 least
 in
 a
 nonfinancial


analysis
 uh
 terminology.
 Um,
 Mandy,


thank
 you.
 Always
 a
 gem.
 Bloomberg


intelligence
 global
 head
 of
 technology


research
 Mandep
 Singh.
 Uh,
 AI
 spend
 and


the
 buildout
 is
 one
 read
 on
 the
 US


economy
 and
 certainly
 the
 tech
 economy.


Now
 to
 another
 great
 read
 uh,
 Bailey
 on


US
 economic
 activity
 and
 we're
 talking


about
 the
 industrial
 supplier
 Fascinol


which
 reported
 earnings
 earlier
 this


morning
 and
 shares
 I
 think
 they
 were
 the


worst
 performing
 the
 S&P
 500
 at
 one


point.
 Yeah,
 right
 now
 down
 about
 6%
 and


keep
 in
 mind
 this
 is
 a
 $50
 billion


company.
 So
 this
 is
 no
 small
 uh
 small


fish
 in
 the
 again
 in
 the
 industrial


space.
 One
 of
 the
 first
 reads
 we
 get


every
 quarterly
 earning
 season
 missing


Wall
 Street
 views
 broadly
 speaking.
 So


interesting
 what's
 driving
 that?


>> Well,
 let's
 ask
 uh
 the
 CEO
 Daniel
 Flores


is
 with
 us.
 He
 is
 uh
 chief
 executive


officer
 of
 Fasinel.
 He
 joins
 us
 from


Winona,
 Minnesota.
 Um
 Dan,
 it
 is
 great


to
 have
 you
 back
 with
 us.
 um
 talk
 to
 us


about
 uh
 the
 quarter
 because
 it
 does


seem
 like
 analysts
 were
 noting
 that
 the


pricing
 during
 the
 quarter
 was
 weaker


than
 expected
 uh
 and
 marks
 the
 second


straight
 quarter
 of
 softer
 pricing
 and


maybe
 that's
 why
 we're
 seeing
 the
 stock


down.
 What
 do
 you
 want
 to
 say
 to


investors?


>> Well,
 u
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 our
 stock's


down
 is
 it's
 priced
 to
 perfection
 if
 you


look
 at
 what
 it's
 done,
 you
 know,
 year


to
 date
 and
 where
 the
 multiple
 has
 gone.


But,
 uh
 you
 know,
 we
 had
 we
 had
 a
 really


good
 quarter.
 We
 had
 uh
 we
 had
 a
 double-


digit
 quarter.
 We
 hadn't
 seen
 that
 for
 a


couple
 years.
 U
 double
 digit
 growth,


sorry.
 And
 uh
 pleased
 with
 the
 outcome.


One
 of
 the
 one
 of
 the
 uh
 challenges
 we


had
 this
 year
 was
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


fluidity
 around
 tariffs
 and
 what
 it


means
 for
 pricing.
 And
 we
 will
 raise


price
 to
 address
 costs
 in
 our
 customer


supply
 chain.
 Um
 we
 we
 really
 don't
 want


to
 raise
 more
 than
 that
 because
 we


believe
 it
 impairs
 our
 ability
 to
 grow


as
 fast
 as
 we'd
 like.
 And
 uh
 you
 know


coming
 into
 the
 quarter
 we
 estimated
 you


know
 X
 for
 uh
 for
 impact
 of
 pricing
 came


in
 a
 little bit
 less.
 We
 lowered
 our


number
 for
 the
 fourth
 fourth
 quarter
 but


the
 most
 important
 aspect
 is
 on
 a
 price


cost
 basis
 we
 are
 neutral
 and
 that's


what
 we
 aspire
 to
 be.
 We'd
 rather
 just


grow.
 M


>> and
 Dan
 to
 your
 point
 uh
 fast
 and
 all


even
 with
 the
 pullback
 today
 returning


22%
 year-to-
 date
 so
 outperforming
 the


S&P
 500
 and
 uh
 comparable
 uh
 stocks
 in


the
 industrial
 space
 but
 just
 one
 more


question
 on
 pricing
 in
 terms
 of


expectations
 would
 you
 want
 to
 raise


pricing
 like
 do
 you
 get
 the
 sense
 that


consumers
 and
 customers
 would
 push
 back


just
 given
 how
 you've
 been
 shifting
 into


bigger
 customers
 spending
 much
 more


money?


>> Yeah,
 customers
 always
 push
 back
 on


pricing.
 It
 doesn't
 matter
 the
 size


customer.
 Uh
 we
 will
 uh
 we
 we
 we
 are


having
 conversations
 with
 our
 customer.


We
 will
 be
 doing
 some
 price
 increases
 in


Q4.
 I
 suspect
 we'll
 be
 doing
 some
 price


increases
 as
 we
 move
 into
 2026.
 But


again,
 our
 first
 discussion
 with
 the


customer.
 Um
 they
 understand
 it.
 They're


willing
 to
 move
 on
 price.
 Our
 first


discussion
 is
 always
 what
 are


alternatives
 to
 this
 product
 that
 maybe


doesn't
 mean
 we
 have
 to
 raise
 your


prices
 5%.
 Maybe
 it
 means
 it
 only
 has
 to


be
 two
 and
 we
 we'd
 rather
 go
 to
 two


because
 that's
 what
 a
 that's
 what
 a


supply
 chain
 partner
 does.


>> Well,
 Dan,
 how
 do
 tariffs
 fit
 into
 this?


Just
 given
 that
 according
 to
 analysts


across
 the
 street
 when
 we
 look
 at


certain
 industries,
 now
 is
 when
 we're


going
 to
 see
 tariffs
 showing
 up
 in
 the


third
 quarter
 in
 guidance
 as
 it
 go
 as
 it


relates
 to
 2026.
 What
 are
 you
 seeing
 and


how
 are
 you
 kind
 of
 attacking
 or


addressing
 any
 pressures
 from
 tariffs?


Yeah.
 So
 for
 us,
 tariffs
 have
 been
 um
 in


the
 in
 the
 equation
 uh
 since
 the
 you


know
 early
 part
 of
 the
 second
 quarter,
 a


little
 bit
 of
 first
 quarter.
 I
 think
 in


the
 the
 individual
 that
 handles
 pricing


um
 historically
 he
 will
 provide
 us
 an


update
 once
 a
 month.
 He'd
 gotten
 to
 the


point
 where
 he
 was
 not
 only
 providing
 us


updates,
 he
 he
 was
 up
 to
 video
 number
 14


as
 of
 July
 that
 he
 was
 serving
 out
 to


the
 field,


>> giving
 them
 guidance
 into
 what
 we
 were


seeing
 in
 our
 supply
 chain.
 And
 u
 and
 so


we've
 been
 adding
 price
 as
 we've
 gone


through
 the
 year
 and
 these
 have
 been


discussions
 with
 customers
 and
 I
 hope


that
 answers
 your
 question.


>> No,
 I
 think
 it
 does.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 big


thing
 is
 are
 you
 mitigating
 the
 impact


of
 tariffs?
 Are
 you
 shifting
 your
 supply


chain?
 Is
 the
 expectation
 that
 you
 can


have
 some
 kind
 of
 knock-on
 effect
 as
 it


relates
 to
 pricing
 if
 we
 do
 continue
 to


see
 threats
 from
 the
 president
 and
 going


after
 countries
 like
 China
 or
 others?
 We


are
 going
 to
 talk
 to
 uh
 one
 of
 the


members
 of
 Levvis's
 management
 team
 and


they
 called
 out
 that
 they
 had
 to
 dial
 up


their
 expectations
 for
 the
 impact
 of


tariffs
 from
 other
 countries.
 So
 how
 is


that
 impacting
 when
 you
 look
 at
 your


supply
 chain
 and
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


potential
 for
 pricing
 impacts
 in
 2026?


>> We've
 been
 moving
 supply
 chain
 around


the
 planet
 in
 earnest
 since
 2017
 2018


time
 frame.


Um,
 as
 our
 name
 would
 imply,
 we
 sell
 a


lot
 of
 fasteners
 and
 most
 of
 the


fasteners
 in
 North
 America
 come
 from


either
 mainland
 China
 or
 or
 Taiwan
 and


the
 automotive
 industry
 took
 the


production
 there
 back
 in
 the
 50s
 and


60s.
 Actually
 took
 it
 to
 Japan
 and
 South


Korea
 and
 it
 migrated
 from
 there.
 If
 I


look
 at
 our
 resources,
 we
 now
 have
 a


sourcing
 team
 in
 Shanghai,
 but
 we
 have
 a


sourcing
 team
 in
 Bangkok.
 We
 have
 a


sourcing
 team
 in
 northern
 India
 and
 we


have
 worked
 to
 diversify
 our
 supplier


base
 around
 the
 planet
 and
 a
 little
 bit


more
 in
 North
 America
 but
 really
 around


the
 planet
 so
 to
 have
 diversity
 in


supply
 so
 you're
 not
 caught
 off
 guard
 by


some
 price
 change
 or
 or
 a
 tariff
 change.


In
 addition
 to
 that
 we've
 taken
 supply


chains
 coming
 into
 North
 America
 which


traditionally
 came
 in
 through
 the
 west


coast
 United
 States
 and
 then
 we
 would


redistribute
 from
 there.
 We
 have
 moved


supply
 chains.
 So
 they're
 bringing


product
 directly
 into
 the
 west
 coast
 of


Canada
 or
 the
 west
 coast
 of
 Mexico


because
 those
 two
 countries
 represent


about
 14%
 of
 our
 revenue.
 Now
 you
 bypass


the
 tariff.
 However,
 it's
 more
 expensive


to
 break
 shipments
 down
 over
 in
 Asia
 and


bring
 them
 in,
 but
 it's
 a
 lot
 less
 than


a
 tariff.


>> One
 of
 the
 things
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you,
 you


know,
 you
 you
 talk
 about
 supply
 chains.


Is
 the
 endgame.
 Um
 Dan,
 we're
 talking


with
 Dan
 Flores.
 He's
 chief
 executive


officer
 of
 Fasinel.
 Is
 it
 about
 though


largely
 reducing
 your
 exposure
 to
 China


which
 has
 been
 a
 pretty
 big
 one?


>> It's
 it's
 reducing
 our
 customers


exposure
 to
 any
 market
 in
 this
 case
 uh


China
 and
 or
 Taiwan
 but
 to
 any
 market


that
 are
 on
 the
 receiving
 end
 of
 some
 of


the
 political
 winds


>> and
 create
 an
 unstable
 supply
 base
 for


our
 customer.
 Here
 it
 happens
 to
 be


China.
 Another
 month
 it
 might
 be
 a


different
 country.
 Another
 year
 it
 might


be
 a
 different
 country.
 It's


diversifying
 your
 supply
 chain
 so
 your


eggs
 are
 not
 all
 in
 one
 basket.


>> Gota
 be
 ready.
 So
 whichever
 for
 a


customer.


>> Yeah.
 Whichever
 way
 the
 winds
 blow.
 Hey,


one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 just


big
 broadly
 uh
 the
 earnings
 update


today.
 You
 talked
 about
 the
 industrial


environment
 still
 sluggish.
 We've
 heard


similar
 commentary
 on
 this
 persistent


sluggishness
 uh
 elsewhere
 from


manufacturers
 as
 well
 as
 caution
 around


project
 delays.
 At
 what
 point
 does
 this


become
 something
 more
 worrying
 than
 just


sluggishness?


>> For
 us,
 it's
 been
 sluggish
 since


November
 of
 2022.


>> Okay.


>> When
 the
 So,
 we
 really
 key
 on
 what
 the


um
 industrial
 um
 Institute
 for
 Supply


Management
 puts
 out
 the
 PMI
 index.


>> Mh.


>> And
 that's
 been
 sub
 50,
 which
 really


plays
 into
 our
 customer
 base.
 Other
 than


January
 and
 February
 of
 this
 year,


that's
 been
 sub
 50
 since
 November
 of


2022.
 So
 we've
 been
 in
 a
 sluggish


economy
 for
 a
 long
 time
 from
 our


perspective
 and
 you
 other
 than
 living


through
 the
 first
 part
 of
 it
 where
 you


had
 customers
 that
 were
 downshifting


what
 reason
 our
 growth
 is
 shining


through
 in
 a
 different
 way.
 A
 I
 think


we're
 executing
 at
 a
 higher
 level
 but
 b


once
 you
 get
 through
 that
 downshifting


now
 you're
 just
 even
 if
 your
 customers


are
 at
 a
 subdued
 level
 you
 can
 grow
 in


that
 kind
 of
 environment
 and
 that's


what's
 shining
 through
 in
 our
 numbers


right
 now.


>> All right.
 One
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you


because
 as
 you
 would
 imagine
 I
 don't


know
 how
 much
 of
 this
 is
 pervasive
 in


your
 world
 but
 AI
 is
 like
 the
 non-stop


conversation
 that
 we
 are
 having
 um


certainly
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 activity
 and


market
 impact
 to
 what
 extent
 is
 AI
 maybe


sucking
 up
 the
 oxygen
 in
 the
 economy.


Are
 you
 seeing
 any
 signs
 of
 that
 or
 your


world
 they're
 going
 to
 still
 need
 what


you
 guys
 supply
 no matter
 what's
 going


on
 with
 the
 AI
 spend
 and
 enthusiasm?


Well,
 first
 off,
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 we


have
 a
 meaningful
 improvement
 in
 our


revenue
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 things
 like


data
 centers
 because
 we
 sell
 into
 a
 wide


range
 of
 of
 customer
 needs
 and
 endmarket


needs,
 whether
 that
 is
 the
 actual


construction.
 I
 I
 visited
 many
 data


centers
 being
 built
 where
 we
 have
 people


on
 site
 there.
 After
 it's
 built,
 we're


supplying
 into
 that
 facility
 with
 things


like
 air
 handling
 and
 maintenance


equipment.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 a
 customers


that
 sell
 into
 that
 sector,
 that's


actually
 a
 strong
 business
 for
 us
 right


now.
 And
 then
 as
 a
 organization,
 we're


we're
 increasingly
 making
 use
 of
 AI
 in


our
 own
 business
 and
 how
 we
 go
 to
 market


and
 how
 we
 help
 our
 employees
 be
 more


efficient
 in
 what
 they
 do.


>> And
 Dan,
 about
 45
 seconds
 here
 with
 in


with
 keeping
 in
 mind
 uh
 data
 center


construction,
 where
 are
 those
 products


sourced
 from?
 Are
 those
 also
 heavily


sourced
 from
 China
 and
 exposed
 to


tariffs
 or
 are
 they
 different
 supply


chain
 altogether?


>> They're
 you
 know
 they're
 it
 it


mostly
 a
 different
 supply
 ch
 source.
 Um


but
 uh
 it
 it
 depends
 on
 the
 component
 if


it's
 facility
 maintenance
 types


products.
 They're
 coming
 from
 anywhere


on
 the
 globe
 and
 so
 they're
 they're


subject
 to
 the
 same
 type
 of
 issues
 any


product
 would
 have.
 But
 a
 lot
 of
 the


components,
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 the


manufacturers
 that
 we
 sell
 into,
 I


visited
 one
 about
 a
 year
 ago
 in
 Michigan


where
 they
 were
 purposely
 avoiding
 China


and
 they're
 selling
 directly
 into
 the


data
 centers.


>> You've
 been
 at
 FastNel
 for
 a
 long
 time.


Um,
 you've
 seen
 different
 cycles.
 How
 do


you
 describe
 this
 one?
 And
 again,
 just


got
 about
 20
 seconds.
 If
 you
 could
 be


very
 quickly,
 very
 quick.
 Oh.
 Um,
 odd
 in


the
 fact
 that,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 similar


what
 we
 saw
 in
 18,
 but
 odd
 with
 the
 fact


of
 it's
 just
 so
 damn
 fluid


>> and
 and
 and
 there's
 so
 many
 things
 that


occur
 from
 week
 to
 week,
 month
 to
 month


that
 are
 outside
 the
 norm,
 but
 the


fundamentals
 still
 work.


>> All right.


>> So,
 serve
 your
 customer
 at
 a
 high
 level,


you
 grow
 your
 business.


>> Love
 talking
 with
 you,
 Dan
 Flores.

CEO
 of
 Fasinel.
