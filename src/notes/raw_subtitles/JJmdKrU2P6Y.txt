All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 close.


We
 are
 live.
 I'm
 sorry
 I'm
 a
 little


late,
 but
 we
 are
 good
 to
 go.
 We've
 got
 a


lot
 of
 stuff
 to
 talk
 about
 today.


Obviously,
 it's
 been
 a
 pretty
 rough
 day.


in
 the
 stock
 market
 to
 say
 the
 least.


We've
 had
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 Vbounce


since
 the
 very
 lows.
 Uh
 so
 S&P
 500
 is


down.
 It's
 not
 down
 as
 bad
 as
 it
 was


during
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 day.
 We're
 at


667.
 We
 got
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to
 663,


which
 is
 why
 a
 lot of
 names
 ended
 up


recovering
 just
 a
 little
 bit.
 Uh
 and


then
 we
 got
 Tesla
 earnings.
 We
 got
 Tesla


earnings
 in
 12
 minutes.
 We're
 going
 to


see
 what
 happens
 with
 Tesla.
 We're
 going


to
 talk
 about
 why
 the
 market
 took
 a


little bit
 of
 a
 dump
 today.
 And
 I
 need


someone
 to
 help
 me
 out.
 Ladies
 and


gentlemen,
 Mr.


Jose
 How's
 that?


>> What's
 going
 on,
 V?
 How's
 everything?


>> It's
 going
 good.
 It's
 been
 a
 quite
 a
 fun


day
 in
 the
 markets
 to
 say
 the
 least.
 Um,


first
 question
 for
 you.
 Did
 you
 uh
 did


you
 buy
 any
 dip
 today?


>> Um,
 did
 I
 buy
 did
 I
 sold
 the
 uh
 puts
 on


on
 Nebas?
 Uh,
 that's
 pretty
 much
 it.
 Um,


but
 haven't
 really
 purchased
 any
 pure


stock.
 Um,


yeah,
 not
 not
 just
 yet.
 If
 if
 it
 if
 this


is
 the
 turnaround,
 I'm
 happy.
 If
 it's


not,
 I'm
 also
 happy
 with
 the
 little


things
 I
 did.


>> Okay,
 so
 I
 went
 shopping.


>> I
 I
 went
 shopping.
 This
 is
 what
 I
 did.


These
 are
 these
 are
 little
 nibbles,
 but


these
 are
 the
 prices.
 Pounder
 172.38.


Bought
 pounder
 171
 like
 three
 weeks
 ago.


So
 I'm
 like,
 all right,
 it's
 a
 dollar


up.
 Nvidia


177.5.


I've
 not
 touched
 Nvidia
 since
 150.
 Since


159.
 This
 is
 the
 first
 time
 for
 Nvidia.


SoFi.
 I
 finished
 the
 500
 shares
 that
 I


said
 I
 was
 going
 to
 buy,
 and
 if
 I


didn't,
 people
 would
 have
 killed
 me.
 Uh


26.88.


That's
 the
 average
 on
 SoFi.
 And
 then,
 of


course,
 we
 had
 to
 do
 Grabby
 Grab.
 So,


555
 on
 Grabby
 Grab.
 So,
 little
 nibbles


across
 the
 board.
 We
 got
 to
 extreme


fear.
 So,
 at
 that
 point,
 I
 was
 just


like,
 "All
 right,
 it
 probably
 is
 worth


at least
 nibbling
 a
 bit."
 I
 don't
 know


if
 we're
 out
 of
 the
 woods.
 I
 don't
 know


how
 this
 is
 going
 to
 change.
 We
 did
 get


a
 V-shape
 towards
 like
 basically
 the


last
 50
 minutes,
 and
 now
 we
 are
 just
 at


fear
 or
 on
 the
 edge
 of
 extreme
 fear.
 but


it's
 not
 as
 bad
 as
 uh
 as
 it
 was
 before.


Now,
 what
 is
 the
 reason
 for
 why
 this
 is


happening
 and
 then
 we're
 going to
 get


into
 Tesla.
 Uh
 you
 know,
 I
 didn't
 see
 a


ton
 of
 reasons
 today.
 I
 did
 get
 one


headline
 that
 could
 be
 kind
 of
 the
 the


main
 argument.
 This
 was
 a
 Reuters
 report


that
 came
 out
 around
 12:30.
 Trump


administration
 considering
 a
 plan
 to


restrict
 globally
 produced
 exports
 to


China
 made
 with
 or
 containing
 US


software.
 New
 export
 controls
 could
 curb


exports
 on
 wide
 range
 of
 goods
 to
 China.


It
 seems
 like
 that
 was
 the
 core
 argument


that
 anything
 that's
 created
 uh
 with
 US


software
 in
 terms
 of
 globally
 produced


goods
 and
 services
 which
 I
 think
 is
 a


lot
 of
 stuff
 created
 with
 US
 software


that
 would
 have
 an
 export
 control.
 Now


obviously
 this
 is
 a
 very
 aggressive


export
 control
 and
 the
 whole
 idea
 is
 to


go
 against
 China's
 export
 controls


against
 rare
 earth
 minerals.
 We're
 going


to
 see
 what
 happens.
 Trump
 also
 tweeted


that
 uh
 he
 is
 going
 to
 be
 tariffing


cattle
 from
 Brazil
 for
 50%.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 that
 really
 tanked
 the
 market,
 but


that
 definitely
 added
 fuel
 to
 the
 fire


after
 that
 China
 export
 control
 rumor


that
 Reuters
 put
 out.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 you


put
 those
 two
 together
 along
 with
 just
 a


general
 choppy
 October
 that
 we're


dealing
 with.
 That's
 why
 you
 had
 a


little bit
 of
 a
 draw
 down.
 And
 that's


some
 of the
 pain
 that
 I
 think
 we're


experiencing
 today.


>> And
 you
 know,
 it's
 crazy.
 I
 think
 I
 was


on
 here,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it
 was
 Thursday


or
 or
 or
 Friday
 last
 week.
 I
 forget
 what


day
 it
 was,
 but
 it
 was
 late
 last
 week,


and
 I
 was
 telling
 you
 how
 uh
 I
 was


feeling
 unease
 of
 the
 market.


>> Yes.
 It's
 crazy
 to
 feel
 that
 my


portfolio
 obviously
 has
 taken
 quite
 a


hit
 uh
 uh
 in
 the
 past
 few
 days,
 but
 like


I
 feel
 so
 much
 better
 now.
 It's
 like
 a
 a


a
 big
 lift
 has
 been
 lifted
 uh
 or
 or
 some


I
 mean
 it's
 obviously
 sucks,
 but
 um
 I


feel
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 excited
 about
 the


market
 now.


>> Well,
 I
 I I
 1,000%
 agree
 and
 I
 would
 uh


love
 people
 in
 the
 in
 the
 chat
 to
 kind


of
 give
 their
 perspective
 on
 this
 as


well.
 I
 think
 that
 some
 of
 these
 names


like
 an
 Oakllo
 that's
 still
 down
 15%
 on


a
 day,
 like
 a
 D-Wave
 that
 is
 down
 14%
 on


a
 day.
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 down
 about


30
 to
 40%
 for
 the
 week.
 At
 the
 end
 of


the
 day,
 they
 needed
 to
 get
 flushed
 out.


They
 needed
 to
 get
 flushed
 out.
 It
 was


not
 healthy
 to
 see
 rare
 earth
 mineral


stocks
 just
 go
 to
 the
 moon.
 All
 of
 them


down
 7
 to
 8%
 on
 the
 day.
 And
 I
 think
 it


actually
 gives
 us
 a
 really
 good
 leg
 up


for
 the
 or
 a
 really
 good
 opportunity
 to


take
 the
 NES
 leg
 up
 if
 we
 could
 have


really
 good
 earnings.
 It's
 just
 a


question
 of,
 you
 know,
 can
 we
 get
 some


good
 earnings?
 And
 today
 we're
 going
 to


see
 with
 Tesla.
 Before
 we
 talk
 about


Tesla,
 one
 last
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 say
 is


some
 of
 these
 momentum
 stocks
 again,


they
 don't
 have
 any
 fundamentals.
 A
 lot


of
 them
 don't
 even
 take
 shareholder


questions.
 So
 Google,
 if
 it
 has
 a
 couple


bad
 months,
 they
 can
 have a
 blowout


quarter.
 Things
 change
 these
 momentum


names.
 And
 the
 worst
 part
 about
 this


draw
 down
 is
 that
 if
 they
 don't
 have


anything
 to
 report
 on
 earnings,
 earnings


is
 not
 going
 to
 save
 them.
 In
 fact,
 a


company
 like
 VRT
 that
 beat
 earnings
 by


20%
 had,
 you
 know,
 phenomenal
 earnings,


this
 stock
 is
 barely
 green
 on
 the
 day.


So
 stocks
 that
 can't
 even
 go
 green
 on


good
 earnings.
 I
 can
 only
 imagine
 what


would
 happen
 to
 some
 of
 those
 names
 that


have
 nothing
 to
 say.
 And
 then
 the
 other


sort
 of
 structural
 analysis
 around
 this


is
 that
 if
 momentum
 dies
 out
 and
 people


don't
 want
 to
 be
 left
 holding
 the
 bag,


you
 know
 who's
 left?
 By
 the
 way,


speaking
 of
 holding
 a
 bag,
 Beyond
 Meat,


this
 was
 $7.50


in
 the
 morning.


>> It's
 back
 to
 350.


Jose,
 any
 thoughts
 on
 uh
 the
 vegans
 of


the
 world
 taking
 over?


>> No,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 crazy
 when
 when
 you
 see


some
 of
 these
 stocks
 of
 100%.
 I
 mean,


congrats
 to
 those
 that
 are
 able
 to
 to


make
 the
 the
 bugs
 or
 or
 trade
 with
 it.


Uh,
 but
 it
 definitely
 sucks
 for
 for
 the


backholders
 that
 uh
 that
 try
 to
 play


this
 game,
 which
 is
 is
 pretty
 intense.


That's
 why
 I
 typically
 don't
 play.
 I'm


not
 a
 fan
 of
 of
 losing
 money
 and
 and


usually
 I'm
 bad
 at
 at
 timing
 things.
 So,


I
 would
 probably
 be
 the
 worst
 trader


ever.


>> Yes.
 I
 I
 think
 maturing
 is
 realizing


that
 if
 you
 miss
 the
 the
 timing
 on
 the


entry,
 then
 you
 probably
 shouldn't
 be


chasing
 it
 because
 not
 that
 many
 good


things
 can
 happen
 when
 when
 it
 goes
 that


route.
 All right.
 Pump
 or
 dump
 poll
 is


live
 in
 the
 chat
 for
 Tesla.
 We
 got
 seven


minutes
 until
 we
 get
 the
 numbers.
 I


mean,
 Jose,
 give
 me
 your
 raw
 thoughts.


Tesla's
 an
 important
 company
 in
 the


world
 of
 AI.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 we
 can


expect?


>> Uh,
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 definitely
 love
 to
 hear


when
 Elon
 or
 the
 team
 talks
 a
 little
 bit


more
 about
 uh
 the
 AI
 innovations.
 I
 saw


one
 of the
 comments
 coming
 in
 through
 AI


I
 think
 it
 was
 even
 directed
 towards
 me


was
 like,
 is
 Tesla
 really
 an
 AI
 company?


I
 really
 do
 believe
 it
 is.
 I
 mean,
 it's


it's
 definitely
 FSD
 is
 the
 greatest


thing
 ever.
 I
 mean
 I
 every
 time
 I
 drive


I
 turn
 that
 baby
 on.
 The
 new
 version


just
 continues
 to
 kill
 it.
 I
 mean
 they


have
 their
 own
 semiconductor
 Tim
 team
 to


develop
 their
 own
 chips.
 Uh
 they
 build


massive
 data
 centers
 within
 the


obviously
 ex
 uh
 in
 independently
 for
 XAI


but
 for
 their
 own
 platforms.
 Uh
 they


also
 kind
 of
 built
 their
 own
 form
 of
 AI


infrastructure
 as
 well.
 So
 I
 mean
 this


is
 I
 could
 care
 less
 about
 the
 cars.


Obviously,
 the
 numbers
 right
 now
 is
 all


about
 the
 cars,
 but
 I
 want
 to
 hear
 more


from
 Elon
 about
 what's
 happening
 here
 in


the
 AI
 space,
 what's
 happening
 here
 in


the
 energy
 space,
 obviously
 with
 their


uh
 energy
 revenue.
 We
 can
 get
 some


sentiment
 of
 how
 that's
 progressing.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 It's
 not
 about
 the
 the


auto
 business
 anymore.
 Obviously,
 it's


about
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 with


everything
 else
 going
 on
 in
 the
 world
 of


Tesla.
 Tesla
 right
 here,
 as
 you
 can
 see,


56
 cents
 EPS
 expected.
 That
 would
 still


be
 down,
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong,
 about
 15
 to


20%
 year-over-year.
 And
 in
 revenue,
 26.7


billion.
 So
 again,
 the
 street's
 not


super
 optimistic
 on
 the
 quality
 of


numbers
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 year-over-year


growth
 rates.
 Um,
 but
 they
 are
 thinking


that,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 if
 Tesla
 can
 beat


these
 numbers,
 then
 those
 expectations


would
 not
 be
 that
 bad.
 Here's
 the


question
 to
 the
 audience.
 Tesla
 right


there
 at
 439.
 Well,
 let's
 actually
 do


this.
 I
 usually
 do
 this
 every
 earnings.


Um,
 do
 you
 own
 Tesla?
 And
 if
 you
 want
 to


disclose
 how
 many
 shares,
 your
 average,


you
 can
 just
 put
 it
 in
 the
 chat.
 We'll


highlight
 some
 of
 the
 people
 that
 are in


here.
 I
 know
 there's
 probably
 some
 Tesla


OGs
 that
 are
 in
 the
 chat,
 but
 I
 mean,


what
 do
 people
 think
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the


metric
 that
 either
 dumps
 the
 stock
 or


pumps
 the
 stock?
 Is
 it
 going
 to
 be


something
 Elon
 says
 that
 pumps
 it,
 or
 is


it
 going
 to
 be
 something
 that,
 you
 know,


Tesla
 really
 misses
 on
 badly


theoretically
 that
 could
 dump
 it?
 I'd
 be


very
 curious
 to
 see
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 people


think.
 By
 the
 way,
 in
 my
 chat,
 57%


of
 people
 say
 dump.
 So,
 we
 got
 a
 decent


amount
 of
 people
 that
 are
 not
 that


excited
 about
 it.
 Uh,
 Jose,
 if
 you
 had


to
 guess
 pump
 or
 dump,
 I
 mean,
 what
 side


would
 you
 lean
 on
 towards?


>> I
 I
 don't
 know.
 Again,
 I'm
 always
 wrong,


but
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 here,
 I'm
 feeling


like
 a
 little
 pump
 here
 on
 on
 Tesla
 for


earnings.


>> You're
 just
 trying
 to
 get
 the
 crowd
 on


your
 side.
 You're
 just
 trying
 to
 get
 the


crowd
 on
 your
 side.


>> I
 don't
 know.
 No,
 no,
 cuz
 I
 don't
 know


if
 I
 just
 jinxed
 it.
 Uh,
 so
 so
 they're


going
 to
 hate
 me.
 Um,
 but
 I
 mean
 for
 one


thing
 that
 I
 I
 I
 do
 find
 interesting


kind
 of
 going
 back
 to
 the
 core
 business


is
 one
 thing
 that
 they've
 talked
 about


in
 prior
 quarters
 was
 that
 they
 were


going
 to
 release
 a
 cheaper
 model
 um
 in


form
 of
 of
 uh
 to
 have
 more
 accessible
 uh


to
 more
 customers
 and
 they
 did
 do
 that


this
 quarter


>> actually
 I
 don't
 know
 was
 a
 part
 of
 this


quarter
 but
 uh
 they
 did
 at least
 release


it
 within
 the
 past
 few
 few
 weeks
 and
 my


question
 I
 I
 wonder
 if
 analysis
 is
 going


to
 answer
 this
 is
 is
 this
 actually
 a


real
 product.
 Obviously,
 it's
 a
 real


product,
 so
 we
 they
 have
 it
 there.
 But


is
 it
 a
 product
 that
 is
 just
 meant
 to


make
 shareholders
 happy
 to
 say,
 "Look,


we
 did
 it."
 Or
 do
 they
 have
 an
 actual


market
 opportunity
 with
 this
 as
 it's


about
 $5,000
 cheaper,
 but
 you're
 losing


off
 so
 many
 things.
 So,
 I
 don't
 think


they're
 going
 to
 just
 say,
 "Ah,
 it's


just
 to
 make
 the
 shareholders
 happy."


But
 I
 wonder
 if
 some
 analysts
 are
 going


to
 put
 some
 pressure
 of
 like,
 what
 was


are
 you
 really
 seeing
 demand
 for
 that


standard
 version
 or
 was
 it
 just


something
 because
 you
 promised
 a
 cheaper


model?


Yeah,
 and
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 were
 a


bit
 disappointed,
 including
 myself,
 with


how
 the
 roll
 out
 of
 that
 cheaper
 model


came
 out
 because
 it
 just
 wasn't
 that


much
 cheaper.
 But
 maybe
 Elon
 can
 give


some
 clarity
 there
 and
 that
 could
 change


a
 lot
 of
 these
 perspectives.
 By
 the
 way,


folks,
 I
 mean,
 I
 thought
 it
 would
 be
 a


crappy
 day
 for
 Tesla
 to
 report.
 It's


kind
 of
 turning
 into
 an
 okay
 day.
 Look


at
 SoFi
 26
 to
 27.
 S&P
 only
 down
 half
 a


percent.
 It
 was
 down
 1.5
 at
 the
 worst.


Nvidia
 176
 to
 180.
 Tesla
 got
 to
 429,
 now


439.
 talent
 here
 171
 to
 175.
 Hoodie
 120


it
 touched
 to
 127.
 You
 got
 grabbed
 from


540
 to
 561.
 Meta's
 basically
 flat
 on
 the


day.
 Amazon
 still
 down
 21797.
 Salesforce


down
 a
 little
 bit.
 But
 it
 looks
 like
 the


algos
 are
 getting
 back
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 more


optimistic
 and
 again
 I
 do
 think
 it
 was


more
 algorithmic
 when
 we
 saw
 the
 draw


down
 intraday
 because
 there
 just
 didn't


seem
 to
 be
 that
 much
 of
 a
 fundamental


reason.
 If
 we
 can
 get
 some
 good
 earnings


starting
 with
 Tesla
 that
 could


definitely
 help.
 We
 also
 have
 Lamb


Research
 in
 the
 semiconductor
 space.
 We


have
 IBM.
 You
 know,
 IBM's
 been
 working


on
 quantum
 computing.
 Google
 announced
 a


breakthrough
 on
 quantum
 computers
 today.


Elon
 actually
 responded
 to
 what
 Sundar


said
 about
 their
 breakthrough
 on
 their


quantum
 algorithm.
 And
 uh
 Elon
 said,


"Congrats.
 Look
 like
 quantum
 computing


is
 becoming
 relevant."
 So,
 you
 got
 Elon


and
 Sundar
 that
 are
 theoretically


bullish
 quantum.
 The
 quantum
 stocks


really
 didn't
 take
 off
 on
 these
 comments


because
 they're
 they're
 just
 still


getting
 hit
 from
 the
 momentum
 drawdown.


Uh
 but
 you
 do
 have
 some
 catalyst
 right


here
 getting
 the
 market
 excited.
 Then


you
 have
 Kinder
 Morgan.
 You
 have
 Crown


Castle,
 SAP,
 and
 the
 software
 world.
 And


then
 obviously
 you
 have
 Tesla
 and
 we're


gonna
 see
 what
 happens
 there.
 So


>> there
 we
 go.


>> Yeah,
 Lamb
 Research
 will
 be
 pretty


interesting.
 I
 mean
 we
 already
 had
 ASML


report
 earnings
 which
 is
 in
 the


equipment
 space.
 So
 similar
 to
 Lamb


Research
 in
 terms
 of
 overall
 market
 and


TSN
 kind
 of
 already
 mentioned
 that
 they


were
 going
 to
 see
 increment
 in
 their


bottom
 range
 of
 capital
 expenditure.
 So


uh
 Lamb
 Research
 definitely
 helps
 a


little
 bit
 more
 in
 advanced
 packaging


and
 in
 the
 memory
 space
 which
 is
 dealing


with
 HBM.
 Uh,
 so
 I'm
 excited
 there.
 I


don't
 own
 it,
 but
 uh
 I'm
 hoping
 for
 a


great
 call
 from
 Lamb
 Research
 there.


>> Okay,
 here
 we
 go.
 Buckle
 up.
 We
 got
 a


bunch
 of
 earnings.
 I
 think
 the
 calls
 at


5:30,
 so
 we
 got
 about
 an
 hour
 and
 a
 half


to
 dissect
 all
 these
 results,
 get
 as


much
 analysis
 as
 we
 can.
 The
 deck's


probably
 going
 to
 come
 out
 in
 15


minutes.
 And
 uh
 the
 results
 might
 come


out
 like
 four,
 so
 we
 might
 have
 to
 wait


five
 minutes.
 But
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how


this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 It's
 crazy


because
 today's
 been
 a
 wild
 day
 across


the
 board.
 Triple
 V,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


$200
 super
 chat.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 And
 it
 doesn't
 even
 feel
 like
 it's


Tesla
 earnings
 day
 because
 of
 the
 ups


and
 downs
 of
 the
 market
 and
 how
 just


volatile
 and
 gut-wrenching
 it's
 been
 up


or
 down,
 but
 it
 is
 Tesla
 earnings
 and


Tesla
 earnings
 will
 officially
 be


starting
 off
 big
 tech
 earnings
 for
 Q3.


Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 Wednesday,
 October
 22nd,
 4


p.m.
 The
 stock
 market


is
 now
 closed.


All
 right,
 we
 are
 done
 for
 the
 day.
 We


are
 done
 for
 the
 day,
 at least
 for
 the


regular
 hours.
 And
 now
 we
 get
 to
 see


what
 happens
 with
 these
 results.
 Tesla


ends
 the
 day
 at
 438,
 down
 about
 1%.


Nvidia,
 I
 mean,
 basically
 a
 nothing


burger.
 Barely
 down
 half
 a
 percent
 on


the
 day.
 Pounder
 was
 down
 3%.
 Hoodie


down
 3.5.
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 names,
 they
 all


went
 down
 together
 and
 then
 they
 came


back
 up
 together
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 AMD


from
 224
 to
 230.
 SoFi
 27
 on
 the
 close.


Grab
 actually
 got
 a
 560
 close.
 Not
 too


bad
 for
 Grab.
 Google
 right
 there
 251.


Reddit
 was
 down
 about
 4%
 on
 the
 day.


Amazon
 down
 1.9.
 Meta
 edited
 up
 flat
 on


the
 day.
 Cororee
 2.7.
 Nebas
 did
 get
 all


the
 way
 to
 94.
 Rebounded
 above
 98
 right


there.
 So
 still
 closed
 down
 5%
 on
 the


day
 but
 did
 get
 that
 $98
 close.
 Open


door
 down
 about
 2.7%
 on
 the
 day.
 Ren
 did


fall
 to
 the
 low
 50s
 back
 up
 to
 5175.


Actually
 fell
 below
 50
 at
 4830.
 You
 had


all
 your
 Bitcoin
 miners
 turned
 data


center
 stocks
 that
 also
 got
 hit


throughout
 the
 day.
 Cipher
 down
 about


10%.
 Again,
 a
 lot of
 those
 momentum


names
 took
 a
 big
 hit
 with
 your
 Oaklo


down
 14%
 and
 D-Wave
 down
 15%.
 But


nonetheless,
 you
 do
 have
 the
 broader
 S&P


that
 was
 down
 half
 a
 percent.
 Which
 is


manageable.
 All right,
 Tesla
 439.
 So,
 we


should
 be
 getting
 results
 in
 about


uh
 literally
 a
 couple
 minutes,
 maybe


less.
 As
 soon
 as
 we
 get
 the
 results,


we're
 going to
 see
 what
 we
 got
 and
 we


will
 go
 from
 there.
 You
 can
 put
 in
 the


chat
 hound
 on
 the
 day.
 The
 day
 ended
 for


me
 down
 about
 116.
 So,
 still
 a
 pretty


ugly
 day.
 It
 was
 worse
 than
 that
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 day.
 Uh
 so,
 but
 we
 got
 a


little
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 of
 a
 recovery.
 Um,


Tesla's
 earnings
 should
 be
 out
 latest


405.
 We
 should
 be
 getting
 those
 numbers


pretty
 soon


and
 then
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 we
 got.


June
 said
 133,
 Loris
 at
 72,
 Jake's
 at


13.
 Yeah,
 it
 was
 worse
 in
 the
 middle
 of


the
 day.


>> And
 are
 you
 are
 you
 looking
 for
 anything


here
 in
 Tesla?
 Is
 there
 anything
 that's


really
 going
 to


>> I
 think
 the
 stock
 moving
 from
 330
 to
 430


even
 I
 didn't
 expect
 that
 and
 I
 think


that
 was
 because
 the
 Elon
 compensation


package
 and
 him
 buying
 a
 billion
 dollars


worth
 of
 stock.
 So
 I
 really
 don't
 know


what
 the
 company
 is
 going
 to
 say
 to
 like


get
 the
 stock
 to
 be
 that
 excited.
 So
 I


don't
 know.
 I
 really
 don't
 know.
 But
 I


do
 think
 they
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 have
 to


go
 down.
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 they
 have
 to


go
 to
 the
 moon
 either.
 And


>> do
 you
 think
 we
 hear
 anything
 about


Optimus
 or
 or
 or
 the
 robotics
 platform


or
 it's
 still
 too
 far
 for
 your
 thoughts?


I
 think
 Elon's
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 it.
 I


just
 don't
 think
 there's
 going
 to
 be


anything
 substantial
 in
 terms
 of
 like


real
 results,
 right?
 And
 so,
 and
 if


there
 is,
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 wild
 card.


I
 think
 people
 get
 really
 excited.
 If


not,
 then


>> yeah,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 we're
 going
 to


see.


>> I
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it
 was
 this
 quarter


where
 we
 saw
 a
 few
 articles
 that
 um
 the


numbers
 that
 they
 promised
 were
 actually


are
 are
 actually
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot


lower.
 So
 I
 wonder
 if
 that
 comes
 out


during
 the
 uh
 Q&A
 session
 uh
 where
 where


some
 of
 the
 op
 I
 think
 they
 mentioned


somewhere
 around
 a
 thousand
 um
 in
 the


first
 year
 and
 some
 reports
 came
 out


that
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 much
 lower
 than


that


>> for
 Optimus,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> You
 said
 he
 would
 do
 a
 million
 by
 like


2030.
 So
 I
 mean
 it's
 just
 a
 lot
 of


ambitious
 targets.
 I
 want
 him
 to


announce
 Walmart
 ordered
 100,000
 robots.


You
 know,
 if
 Amazon
 just
 put
 out
 a


report
 yesterday
 saying
 they're
 thinking


of
 getting
 rid
 of
 600,000
 humans
 for


robots,
 then
 theoretically
 the
 demand


should
 be
 there
 from
 a
 Walmart
 or
 a


FedEx
 or
 like
 Elon
 should
 be
 able
 to
 get


somewhat
 of
 an
 agreement
 even
 if
 it's


not
 real
 revenue
 yet
 and
 and
 make
 it


material.
 But,
 you
 know,
 that's
 what
 I


think
 would
 actually
 get
 the
 street
 to


put
 it
 into
 their
 valuation
 models.


Don't
 have
 numbers
 yet.
 We
 are
 going


red.
 We
 were
 going
 green
 for
 a
 little


bit.
 It's
 basically
 flat.
 437.


437.


It
 was
 at
 442.
 The
 other
 companies,
 I


don't
 have
 any
 earnings
 on
 those


companies
 either.


Oh,
 no.
 I
 got
 it.
 Tesla


>> supposed
 to.
 Yep.
 Mhm.


>> Oh,
 they
 missed.
 Missed
 by
 11%
 on
 EPS.


Uh
 50
 cents
 versus
 56
 cents
 expected.


So,
 that
 is
 a
 miss.
 Revenue.
 They
 beat


revenue
 they
 beat
 by
 5%.


A
 miss
 and
 a
 beat.
 A
 miss
 and
 a
 beat.


Wow.
 They
 actually
 missed
 on
 EPS.


I
 mean,
 even
 last
 time
 they
 had
 a
 little


bit
 better
 of
 a
 I
 think
 they
 only
 missed


by
 2%
 this
 time
 11%.
 50
 cents
 versus
 56


cents,
 28.09
 billion
 versus
 26.7.
 So,


you
 do
 have
 a
 uh
 basically
 1.3
 billion


beat.
 EPS
 is
 down
 31%
 year-over-year,
 no


earnings
 growth,
 negative
 earnings


growth.
 Revenue
 at
 least
 is
 up
 12%.
 So,


you
 do
 have
 some
 revenue
 growth,
 but
 EPS


is
 down.
 The
 stock
 goes
 red
 431.


See,
 I
 told
 you
 I
 jinxed
 it.
 Um
 Um
 This


is
 This
 quarter
 still
 had
 all
 the


credits
 though,
 right?
 For
 for
 um


>> Yes.


>> electric
 vehicles.
 So
 now
 it's
 it's


going
 to
 be
 How
 does
 that
 change
 the
 I


guess
 the
 outlook
 for
 the
 upcoming


upcoming
 quarters
 for
 this?


>> To
 be
 fair
 though,
 it's
 down
 1.3%.
 Like


I
 mean
 it's
 it's
 not
 even
 it's
 not
 even


kind
 of
 aggressive,
 right?
 And
 this
 is


kind
 of
 what
 I've
 been
 predicting
 for


the
 past
 couple
 days
 that
 it
 doesn't


have
 to
 go
 down
 a
 lot,
 but
 it
 doesn't


have
 to
 go
 up
 a
 lot.
 I
 think
 every
 Tesla


shareholder
 should
 be
 really
 happy
 if
 it


just
 doesn't
 tank
 because
 one
 could


argue
 there
 might
 not
 have
 been
 a
 reason


for
 it
 to
 go
 up
 as
 much
 as
 it
 did
 over


the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 And
 as
 you
 can


see
 on
 the
 stock,
 you're
 not
 really


getting
 a
 move
 up
 or
 down.


Maybe
 guidance
 pumps
 it.
 We're
 going
 to


wait
 for
 the
 deck.
 The
 deck
 should
 be


out
 in
 a
 second
 and
 then
 we'll
 go
 throw


the
 numbers.
 But
 outside
 of
 guidance
 or


Elon
 saying
 something
 good,
 I
 didn't


expect
 them
 to
 miss
 EPS.
 I
 really
 I


thought
 I
 thought
 I
 thought
 they
 would


come
 in
 line
 on
 EPS.
 But
 there
 you
 go.


Let's
 get
 the
 results
 right
 here.
 This


is
 what
 we've
 got
 on
 Tesla.


>> Morgan,
 it
 is
 a
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 line
 and


a
 miss
 on
 the
 bottom
 line
 for
 Tesla.
 The


company
 bringing
 in
 revenue
 better
 than


expected
 28.1
 billion.
 The
 street
 was


expecting
 26.36
 billion,
 but
 EPS
 comes


in
 at
 50
 cents
 a
 share.
 50-0
 50
 cents
 a


share.
 The
 street
 was
 expecting
 55
 cents


a
 share.
 So,
 not
 a
 huge
 miss,
 but
 it
 is


a
 miss
 nonetheless.
 We're
 going
 to
 go


back
 through
 the
 numbers,
 guys.


Hopefully,
 we'll
 get
 some
 more
 details


in
 terms
 of
 uh
 future
 plans,
 future


obligations,
 and
 the
 kind
 of
 concrete


details
 that
 investors
 are
 looking
 for


when
 it
 comes
 to
 things
 like
 robo
 taxi,


autonomous
 vehicle
 development,
 etc.


We'll
 let
 you
 know
 when
 we
 come
 across


some
 of
 those
 nuggets
 that
 are
 worth


flashing.


>> All right,
 Phil,
 thank
 you.
 We'll
 be


back
 to
 you.
 Shares
 are
 down
 about
 1%


right
 now.
 Barb,
 want
 to
 get
 your


reaction
 to
 this,
 especially
 since
 Tesla


is
 not
 necessarily
 a
 name
 that
 uh
 trades


on
 the
 fundamentals
 here.


>> No,
 it
 doesn't.
 I
 mean,
 80%
 of
 their


revenues
 are
 from
 autos
 and
 yet
 it's
 at


a
 250
 plus
 PE
 on
 forward
 earnings
 and


it's
 really
 on
 the
 hook.


>> All right,
 let's
 get
 into
 some
 of
 these


numbers.
 So,
 this
 is
 what
 we've
 got
 on


Tesla.
 Third
 quarter
 revenue
 28.1
 versus


26.6.


Uh
 EPS50s.
 Free
 cash
 flow
 3.9
 versus


1.25
 billion.
 So
 they
 did
 beat
 on
 free


cash
 flow.
 Gross
 margin
 18%
 versus
 17.2.


They
 did
 beat
 on
 those
 gross
 margins.


That
 is
 actually
 way
 better
 than
 I


thought.
 Operating
 income
 1.62
 versus


1.65.
 They
 missed
 on
 operating
 income.


Probably
 why
 they
 missed
 on
 uh
 net


income
 as
 well.
 And
 then
 overall
 EPS


again
 was
 lower
 than
 expected
 for
 Tessy.


So
 they
 beat
 on
 margins,
 missed
 on


operating
 income,
 they
 beat
 on
 free
 cash


flow
 by
 a
 large
 amount.
 The
 credits


might
 be
 helping
 their
 free
 cash
 flow.


And


>> that's
 what
 I
 saw.
 I
 mean,
 massive
 free


cash
 flow,
 year-over-year
 growth
 and


sequential
 growth.
 I
 would
 have
 because


the
 slideshow
 the
 up
 the
 deck
 is
 up,
 but


that
 was
 something
 that
 really
 shocked


me
 there.


>> Okay,
 let's
 pull
 up
 the
 deck


and
 let's
 pull
 this
 out.
 Um,


okay.
 So,
 let's
 first
 of
 all
 read
 their


letter,
 their
 their
 small
 summary,
 and


then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.
 Okay,


here
 we
 go.
 In
 Q3,


the
 Tesla
 team
 achieved
 record
 vehicle


deliveries
 globally,
 showing
 C
 strength


and
 growth
 across
 all
 regions
 while
 also


achieving
 record
 energy
 storage


deployments
 across
 the
 residential,


industry,
 and
 utility
 utility
 sectors.


The
 strong
 performance
 resulted
 in
 both


record
 revenue
 and
 free
 cash
 flow


generation
 in
 the
 quarter.
 We
 continue


to
 launch
 new
 products
 that
 excite
 our


customers
 across
 automotive
 and
 energy.


We
 launched
 the
 Model
 Y
 L
 and
 Model
 Y


performance
 and
 further
 expanded
 our


vehicle
 offering
 with
 the
 Model
 3
 and


Model
 Y
 standard,
 our
 most
 affordable


vehicles.
 We
 also
 unveiled
 the
 Mega
 Pac


3
 and
 Mega
 Block,
 which
 will
 further


simplify
 large
 battery
 installations
 by


reducing
 cost
 and
 time
 to
 deploy.
 We


believe
 our
 scale
 and
 cost
 structure


will
 enable
 us
 to
 navigate
 the
 shifting


market
 dynamics
 across
 the
 globe
 more


effectively
 than
 our
 peers
 with
 advances


in
 AI
 making
 our
 products
 the
 most


compelling
 in
 the
 market.
 Our
 focus


remains
 on
 scaling
 our
 core
 hardware


business
 by
 maximizing
 our
 deliveries


and
 deployments
 our
 as
 these
 products


will
 deliver
 increasing
 value
 to
 our


customers
 over
 time
 via
 services
 powered


by
 AI.
 Every
 Tesla
 vehicle
 delivered


today
 is
 designed
 for
 autonomy
 while


every
 Tesla
 energy
 story
 product
 energy


storage
 product
 is
 capable
 of
 being


enhanced
 and
 optimized
 by
 your
 virtual


power
 plant
 or
 auto
 bidder


functionality.
 We
 continue
 to
 deliver
 a


fleet
 of
 products
 that
 brings
 AI
 into


the
 real
 world
 as
 we
 pursue
 a
 future
 of


sustainable
 abundance
 as
 outlined
 in
 our


master
 plan
 part
 4.
 While
 we
 face


near-term
 uncertainty
 from
 shifting


trade,
 tariff,
 and
 fiscal
 policy,
 we
 are


focused
 on
 long-term
 growth
 and
 value


creation.
 We
 are
 prudently
 making
 the


necessary
 investments
 in
 our
 business,


including
 future
 business
 lines
 that
 we


believe
 will
 drive
 incredible
 value
 for


Tesla
 and
 the
 world
 across
 transport,


energy,
 and
 robotics.


Okay.
 Uh
 stock
 is
 kind
 of
 going
 green


here


a
 little
 bit.


I
 mean,
 I
 mean,
 definitely
 was
 a
 nice


improvement
 in
 overall
 revenues,
 right?


I
 mean,
 quarter
 2
 was
 22
 billion
 and
 and


quarter
 1
 was
 19
 billion.
 Here
 they
 did


28
 billion
 uh
 this
 quarter.
 So,
 um


not
 sure
 if
 everybody's
 just
 trying
 to


buy
 those
 cars
 before
 the
 end
 of
 the
 um


the
 credits
 ended.
 Um
 but
 there
 was


definitely
 a
 nice
 pickup
 in
 in
 revenue


growth
 where
 you
 even
 saw
 a


year-over-year
 growth
 in
 the
 automotive


segment
 as
 well.


>> Yeah,
 energy
 services
 uh
 increase
 in


vehicle
 deliveries
 that
 helped.
 They


said
 our
 operating
 income
 decreased


40%
 resulting
 in
 a
 5.8%
 operating


margin.
 The
 reason
 was
 because
 of
 SBC,


lower
 credits,
 lower
 onetime
 FSD
 revenue


recognition,
 higher
 average
 cost
 per


vehicle
 due
 to
 lower
 fixed
 cost


absorption
 absorption,
 and
 an
 increase


in
 operating
 expenses.
 So,
 kind
 of
 the


typical
 things
 any
 business
 would
 have


to
 deal
 with,
 but
 they
 were
 a
 bit
 more


aggressive
 this
 quarter
 for
 Tesla.
 And


that's
 why
 that
 operating
 income
 came
 in


just
 not
 as
 strong
 as
 some
 people


expected.
 438


is
 what
 you've
 got
 on
 the
 stock.
 All


right,
 we'll
 get
 back
 to
 Tesla,
 but


let's
 look
 at
 some
 of these
 other


earnings
 that
 I
 believe
 are
 out.
 Uh
 IBM


down.
 So,
 you
 got
 IBM
 taking
 a
 bit
 of
 a


hit.
 Let's
 see if
 we
 can
 pull
 up
 those


numbers.
 SAP,
 uh
 that's
 ugly.
 EPS,
 they


missed
 by
 18%.


Let
 me
 make
 sure
 that
 is
 correct.
 SAP,


no,
 no,
 SAP,
 they
 Okay,
 that
 was
 a


different
 company.
 SAP,
 they
 beat
 by
 6%.


They've
 missed
 on
 revenue.
 EPS
 up
 40%


year-over-year.
 Revenue
 is
 up
 15%


year-over-year.
 So
 SAP
 not
 doing
 too


bad.
 That
 stock,
 although
 Street
 doesn't


like
 it,
 is
 down
 5.4%.


So
 one
 of
 European's
 biggest
 software


companies
 that's
 down.
 IBM
 beat
 by
 8%
 on


EPS,
 265
 versus
 245,
 16.3
 versus
 16.1
 in


revenue.
 Revenues
 up
 9%
 year-over-year.


EPS
 up
 15.
 IBM,
 that
 stock
 also


is
 down
 by
 about
 2%.


So
 you
 got
 IBM
 research
 is
 up
 up
 after


hours
 right
 now.
 I'm
 trying
 to
 look
 at


their
 their
 sites,
 but
 it's
 up
 about
 2


3%.
 And
 pulling
 down,
 it
 seems,
 but
 it's


still
 up.


>> Yeah.
 Don't
 have
 the
 numbers
 for
 Lamb


yet.
 Oh,
 no.
 We
 do.
 We
 do.
 Beat
 by
 2%


124
 versus
 122.
 5.3
 billion
 versus
 5.23


billion.
 IBM
 Consulting
 revenue
 missed.


Okay,
 so
 that
 could
 be
 explaining
 a


little bit
 of
 the
 weakness
 there.


Revenues
 up
 30%
 year-over-year
 for
 Lamb


Research.
 EPS
 up
 44%
 year-over-year.
 I


mean,
 these
 numbers
 outside
 of
 Tesla


missing
 on
 EPS
 are
 pretty
 good
 across


the
 board,
 which
 is
 what
 we've
 seen
 in


Q3
 earnings
 so
 far.
 It's
 just
 a
 lot
 of


these
 stocks
 either
 have
 it
 baked
 in
 or


they're
 not
 going to
 react
 as


aggressively
 to
 the
 upside
 on
 these


names.


Okay,
 so
 that's
 what
 you
 got
 on
 some
 of


you
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 coverage
 on


some
 of
 the
 other
 names.
 Uh
 let's
 pull


up
 IBM
 and
 go
 from
 there.


Uh
 the
 results
 are
 a
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and


bottom
 lines,
 but
 you
 see
 the
 stock


moving
 lower.
 I'll
 tell
 you
 why
 that


might
 be
 in
 just
 a
 moment.
 Guidance


raised
 for
 Q4
 uh
 in
 effect
 because
 a


full
 year
 is
 raised.
 So
 there's
 an


asterisk
 on
 the
 beat.
 Get
 to
 that
 in
 a


moment,
 but
 revenue
 beat
 at
 16.33


billion
 versus
 169


consensus.
 The
 upside
 though
 did
 not


come
 from
 software
 overall.
 Software
 at


7.21
 billion
 in
 line
 with
 consensus.


Consulting
 though
 did
 beat
 at
 5.32


billion
 versus
 5.24
 expected.


Infrastructure
 in
 this
 mainframe
 cycle


is
 up
 15%
 in
 constant
 currency
 which


also
 accounts
 for
 a
 big
 amount
 of
 the


beat.
 Uh
 now
 for
 the
 full
 year
 a


constant
 currency
 revenue
 growth
 of
 more


than
 5%
 now
 is
 what
 IBM
 is
 guiding
 to
 up


from
 at
 least
 5%
 from
 the
 last
 release.


a
 free
 cash
 flow
 uh
 for
 the
 full
 year
 at


14
 billion
 up
 from
 13.5.
 Now
 I
 did
 speak


with
 IBM
 CEO
 Arvin
 Krishna
 about
 the


quarter
 just
 a
 little
 bit
 ago.
 The


reason
 why
 software
 was
 just
 in
 line
 was


Red
 Hat.
 It
 was
 up
 less
 than
 expected


while
 other
 AI
 related
 business
 did


better
 than
 expected.
 Krishna
 did
 tell


me
 the
 Red
 Hat
 miss
 is
 just
 a
 blip.


Here's
 some
 of
 what
 he
 said.
 Red
 Hat
 did


12%
 instead
 of
 14%
 he
 told
 me
 which
 it


did
 last
 quarter.
 You
 don't
 see
 me


worried
 about
 it
 because
 our
 bookings


growth
 remained
 strong
 at
 20%.
 We
 did


have
 some
 weakness
 earlier
 in
 Q4
 late
 20


in
 sorry
 in
 24
 late
 23.
 So
 by
 the
 end
 of


this
 year
 that
 all
 kind
 of
 washes
 itself


out
 and
 other


>> so
 consulting
 revenue
 being
 the
 big


issue
 in
 the
 context
 of
 IBM.
 I
 mean


outside
 of
 that
 lamb
 research
 still
 flat


on
 those
 numbers.
 You're
 not
 seeing
 a


big
 whipssaw
 to
 the
 upside
 or
 to
 the


downside
 on
 any
 of
 these
 names
 outside


of
 SAP.


>> Not
 like
 yesterday.


>> No,
 not
 like
 yesterday
 at
 all.
 And
 Tesla


is
 just
 still
 chilling
 out.


That's
 it.
 It's
 really
 not
 moving
 in
 an


aggressive
 way.
 I'm
 still
 looking
 at
 the


earnings
 deck.
 Jose,
 if
 you
 see
 anything


that
 you
 think


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 find
 people
 are


saying
 that
 they're
 uh
 they
 mentioned


something
 about
 the
 S
 Cyber
 Cab,
 the


Semi
 and
 Mega
 Pack
 3
 are
 scheduled
 for


volume
 production
 starting
 in
 2026.
 I


but
 I
 have
 yet
 to
 find
 it
 in
 the
 um
 in


the
 deck
 just
 yet.


>> Well,
 let
 me
 Yeah,
 there
 there's
 this


line
 they
 always
 have
 that
 says
 they're


ready
 to
 start
 in
 2026.


Um


which
 is
 important
 because
 it
 gives
 you


some
 timelines.
 The
 only
 2026.
 Yeah.


Right
 here.
 Cyberc
 cab,
 Tesla
 Semi,
 and


Mega
 Pack
 are
 on
 schedule
 for
 volume


production
 starting
 in
 2026.
 First


generation
 production
 lines
 for
 Optimus


are
 being
 installed
 in
 anticipation
 of


volume
 production.


That's
 good
 news.


That's
 like
 decent
 to
 hear.
 Um,


that's
 more
 Optimus
 news
 than
 I
 thought


we
 were
 going
 to
 get.


>> Yeah,
 that
 is.
 I
 didn't
 expect
 that
 one


actually.
 First
 generation
 production


lines
 for
 Optimus
 are
 being
 installed
 in


anticipation
 of
 volume
 production
 aka


there
 should
 be
 decent
 demand
 that
 is


coming
 through.
 Uh
 and
 then
 cyber
 cap


Tesla
 semi
 mega
 3
 on
 schedule
 for
 volume


production
 in
 2026.
 So
 we
 have


sufficient
 liquidity
 to
 fund
 our
 product


roadmap
 long-term
 capacity
 expansion


plans
 while
 we
 continue
 to
 execute
 on


innovations
 to
 reduce
 the
 cost
 of


manufacturing
 operations
 over
 time.
 We


expect
 our
 hardware
 related
 profits
 to


be accompanied
 by
 the
 acceleration
 of


AI.
 Uh,
 while
 we
 are
 making
 prudent


investments
 that
 will
 set
 up
 our


vehicle,
 energy
 and
 other
 future


businesses
 for
 growth,
 the
 actual


results
 will
 depend
 on
 a
 variety
 of


factors.


Yeah,
 you're
 not
 getting
 anything
 too


crazy.
 We
 already
 know
 they
 have
 the


highest
 quarterly
 energy
 storage
 ever.


That
 was
 announced
 on
 their
 deliveries.


We
 recently
 launched
 a
 new
 lease


offering
 in
 the
 US
 for
 solar
 plus
 power


wall
 that
 provides
 customers
 with


predictable
 energy
 costs.
 We
 believe


this
 is
 the
 new
 lease
 offering
 that
 is


going
 to
 help
 drive
 incremental
 demand


for
 residential
 energy
 products
 over


time.


Tesla
 still
 flat.


All
 right,
 there
 you
 go.
 That's
 what
 we


have
 on
 Tesla
 earnings.
 Basent
 is


talking
 somewhere
 and
 he's
 saying
 a


bunch
 of
 things.
 Uh,
 number
 one,
 he


says,
 "I
 think
 housing
 prices
 are
 a


lagging
 indicator."
 Number
 two,
 he
 says,


"I
 might
 see
 or
 you
 might
 see
 CPI
 coming


down
 next
 month
 and
 the
 month
 after."


Number
 three,
 he
 says,
 "Going
 to
 see


substantial
 tax
 refunds
 for
 Americans."


I
 don't
 know
 if
 Bent
 means
 through
 a


tariff
 dividend
 or
 something,
 but


He's
 saying
 a
 ton
 of
 stuff
 and
 then
 he


said
 gold
 prices
 rising
 has
 helped
 us


substantially.


Okay,
 so
 wherever
 Bent
 is
 talking
 he
 is


saying
 some
 stuff
 around
 gold
 and
 tax


refunds
 that's
 helping
 out.


Um
 QuantumCape
 that's
 another
 battery


production
 company.


>> They
 are
 I
 think
 having
 a
 much
 better


earnings
 right
 here
 on
 their
 stock.


Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.


You're
 getting
 a
 pump
 right
 there.
 Their


QS
 that's
 up
 9%
 after
 hours.
 Jose,
 any


thoughts
 on
 this
 one
 if
 you
 are


familiar?


>> A
 little
 bit
 in
 here,
 right?
 I
 mean,


they
 they
 continue
 to
 announce
 some
 nice


partnerships,
 I
 think,
 with
 Volkswagen


and
 their
 batteries
 are
 definitely


moving
 a
 little
 bit
 further
 than
 just
 uh


a
 scientific
 theory,
 right?
 So,
 uh
 um
 it


seems
 to
 be
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 excitement


right
 now.
 Even
 with
 this
 afterhour


move,
 though,
 it's
 still
 down
 for
 for


for
 the
 day,
 right?
 opened
 up
 at
 a


roughly
 $1460


uh
 sorry
 at
 $1522.


>> Yeah.
 Stock
 was
 down
 12%
 on
 the
 day,
 up


7%
 after
 hours.
 This
 is
 an
 8
 billion


company,
 no
 revenue.
 Uh
 and
 EPS,
 they


lost
 18
 cents
 a
 share,
 which
 is
 better


than
 what
 the
 street
 expected.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 right
 maybe
 chat


might
 be
 more
 familiar,
 but
 I
 think
 they


did
 announce
 some
 nice
 partnerships
 with


I
 was
 it
 Volkswagen?
 I
 think
 with


Volkswagen
 that
 they
 were
 going
 to
 um
 be


using
 some
 of
 their
 products.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of


these
 companies
 again,
 where
 is
 QS
 over


the
 past
 five
 days?
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 you


got
 to
 put
 it
 in
 the
 momentum
 bucket,


right?
 Down
 25%
 over
 the
 past
 days.


still
 up
 1%
 over
 the
 past
 month,
 which


shows
 you
 how
 much
 momentum
 there
 was,


but
 at least
 less
 losses
 than
 expected


uh
 on
 on
 EPS.


Uh
 all
 right,
 so
 most
 of the
 people
 that


said
 dump
 on
 the
 chat,
 you
 you're
 not


wrong.


You're
 you're
 not
 right
 either
 because


we're
 not
 really
 dumping,
 but
 everyone


who
 said
 pump.


>> Yes.


>> Yeah.
 But
 every
 Sunday
 pump
 is


definitely
 not
 right
 because
 we're
 not


really
 pumping
 either.
 Uh
 let's
 get
 some


more
 coverage
 right
 here.
 This
 is
 from


Roth
 Capital.
 They
 have
 about
 a
 $400


price
 target
 on
 Tesla.
 Here's
 what
 they


have
 to
 say
 about
 the
 quarter.


>> Every
 quarter.
 Uh
 but
 do
 want
 to
 get


your
 initial
 takeaways
 especially
 as


revenue
 jumps
 12%
 year-over-year.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 it
 was
 6%
 uh


above
 uh
 consensus
 in
 the
 quarter.
 So
 we


knew
 they
 were
 going
 to
 beat
 the


quarter,
 right?
 because
 the
 expirray
 of


credits
 there's
 always
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


a
 pull
 forward.
 Um
 the
 real
 question
 is


whether
 or
 not
 uh
 they
 created
 a
 a


slightly
 smaller
 hole
 uh
 that
 they
 get


to
 fill
 in
 the
 uh
 in
 the
 December


quarter.
 Um
 their
 language
 in
 the


outlook
 uh
 the
 outlook
 uh
 statement


where
 they
 say
 uh
 it's
 difficult
 to


measure
 the
 impact
 of
 shifting
 global


trade
 and
 fiscal
 policies
 seems
 to


suggest
 that
 they
 they
 don't
 really
 have


a
 clear
 view
 yet
 on
 um
 whether
 or
 not


the
 price
 adjustments
 that
 they
 put


through
 are
 going
 to
 significantly
 dent


uh
 the
 momentum
 that
 they've
 picked
 up


in
 the
 last
 several
 months.
 So
 um
 you


know
 they're
 being
 cautious
 here.
 Um,


you
 know,
 the
 direction
 of
 the
 stock


though
 coming
 out
 of
 the
 call
 is
 going


to
 be a
 function
 of
 what
 they
 say
 on


Optimus,
 what
 they
 say
 on
 um,
 you
 know,


robo
 taxi
 really
 more
 than
 anything


right
 now
 and
 the
 outlook
 for
 them
 uh,


removing
 the
 um,
 the
 surrogate
 drivers


in
 these
 cars.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 what's


what's
 the
 potential
 there
 and
 how
 how


do
 they
 see
 this
 taking
 shape
 over
 the


next
 the
 next
 number
 of
 months?


>> Um,
 and
 and
 I
 got
 to
 interact
 with
 one


of
 the
 Optimus
 robot
 variants
 a
 couple


of
 week
 just
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 ago
 at


the
 upsummit.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 pretty


incredible,
 but
 it
 also
 still
 seems
 to


me
 like
 it
 has
 a
 long
 way
 to
 go
 here.


So,
 how
 much
 of
 this
 is
 based
 on
 that


commentary
 about
 the
 future
 versus
 the


nearer
 term,
 especially
 when
 you
 do
 see


things
 like,
 and
 I
 think
 it
 gets


overshadowed
 a
 lot,
 um,
 you
 know,
 the


energy
 business
 seems
 to
 be
 very
 strong


too.


>> Yeah,
 energy
 is
 strong.
 Um,
 the
 the
 sort


of
 tailwind
 from,
 you
 know,
 electricity


prices
 up,
 you
 know,
 basically
 40%.
 You


over
 the
 last
 few
 years.
 Um,
 it's
 it's


something
 that
 really
 does
 improve


economics
 there.
 U,
 they
 will
 have
 real


competition
 in
 there.
 they
 are
 the


largest
 competitors.
 They
 they'll


dominate
 like
 they
 do
 in
 everything
 that


they
 do.
 Um
 but
 it's
 it's
 not
 nearly
 as


large
 a
 market
 at
 least
 in
 my
 view
 as


say
 the
 potential
 for
 Optimus
 and
 then


the
 automotive
 market
 and
 eventually
 EVs


will
 come
 back
 and
 will
 be
 back
 back
 in


vogue
 and
 Tesla's
 going
 to
 be
 the


category
 king
 at
 that
 time
 still.
 So
 um


you
 know
 you
 have
 a
 variety
 of
 things


that
 are
 kind
 of
 working
 for
 them.
 Um


right
 now
 I'm
 just
 excited
 about


Optimus.
 You
 know,
 I
 I
 think
 that
 um
 you


know,
 the


>> the
 glitching


>> Jose
 I
 mean,
 picking
 up
 on
 that


conversation
 right
 there.
 Um
 and
 by
 the


way,
 guys,
 for
 those
 that
 are on
 my


channel,
 Jose's
 Twitter,
 so
 please
 make


sure
 to
 follow
 him
 there
 and
 his
 YouTube


as
 well
 in
 the
 description.
 Is
 Optimus


the
 only
 real
 exciting
 story
 you
 think


is
 out
 there
 right
 now
 to
 get
 this
 stock


to
 get
 some
 momentum?


>> I
 maybe
 for


trend
 the
 the
 trend
 market,
 I
 guess,


because
 we
 keep
 hearing
 about
 the
 the


robotic
 space
 from
 everybody,
 right?


Nvidia
 and
 all
 these
 big
 companies,


right?
 So,
 it
 definitely
 is
 a
 trend


topic
 at
 the
 moment.
 Um,
 but
 I
 think
 for


Nvidia,
 I
 mean
 for
 for
 for
 Tesla
 just


it's
 overall
 FSD,
 I
 think
 FSD
 has


various
 opportunities,
 not
 just
 in
 the


automotive
 market,
 but
 whatever
 they
 can


learn
 there
 could
 be
 formed
 into
 not


just
 Optimus,
 which
 is
 a
 humanoid


robotics,
 but
 any
 other
 type
 of
 robotic


product
 that
 they
 can
 produce.
 Right?


Robotics
 come
 in
 all
 shapes
 and
 sizes.


It
 could
 just
 be
 it
 could
 be
 a
 humanoid


robot.
 uh
 they
 can
 have
 a
 cheaper


version
 in
 the
 future
 which
 could
 just


be
 a
 AI
 hand
 robot
 which
 can
 do
 certain


things
 for
 businesses.
 So
 there
 is
 that


opportunity
 thanks
 to
 all
 this
 AI
 um


push
 and
 AI
 learning
 that
 they're
 doing


as
 well.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 I
 feel
 like
 the
 energy


part
 of
 the
 business
 also
 is
 a
 little


bit
 more
 exciting
 than
 robots
 right
 now


because
 there's
 all
 this
 need
 for
 energy


and
 like
 obviously
 Tesla
 should
 have
 the


scale
 and
 infrastructure
 to
 supply
 that


demand
 probably
 more
 than
 some
 of these


other
 smaller
 energy
 stocks
 that
 are


going
 to
 the
 moon
 and
 you
 know
 they


don't
 have
 anything
 that
 Tesla
 has.


>> It's
 just
 not
 become


>> a
 focal
 part
 of
 the
 business
 right
 that


is
 true.
 I
 mean,
 for
 for
 data
 sensors,
 I


mean,
 you
 want
 that
 constant
 power
 all


the
 time.
 And
 unfortunately,
 right
 now


with
 data
 sensors
 and
 GPUs,
 if
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 charts
 out
 there
 that
 showcase


kind
 of
 the
 usage
 of
 of
 how
 the
 grid


goes
 when
 when
 you're
 powering
 on
 and


using
 all
 these
 GPUs
 and
 it's
 just
 this


crazy
 crazy
 seesaw
 effect.
 Uh,
 but
 the


great
 thing
 is
 you
 you
 can't
 have
 things


like
 that.
 You
 need
 it
 to
 be
 more


stable.
 And
 Tesla,
 I
 mean,
 their
 their


packs
 are
 being
 used
 by
 XAI.
 Uh,
 and
 I'm


pretty
 sure
 it's
 going
 to
 continue.
 So


that
 data
 center
 market
 growth
 can
 even


within
 that
 market
 can
 be
 a
 huge
 huge


customer
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 crazy
 packs


that
 they
 have
 for
 for
 for
 the
 big


plays.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 could
 be
 a


substantial
 growth
 driver
 if
 they
 get


some
 of
 these
 massive
 data
 center


contracts
 as
 well
 or
 if
 the
 overall


demand
 for
 data
 centers
 continues
 to


grow
 and
 need
 energy.
 We
 do
 have


Southwest
 Airlines.
 They
 also
 had


earnings
 today.
 Uh
 they
 beat


EPS
 was
 11
 versus
 negative
 3
 cents.


That's
 a
 really
 healthy
 beat.
 Operating


revenue
 was
 slightly
 up.
 Passenger


revenue
 6.3
 billion
 versus
 6.2.
 That's


up
 1%.
 Then
 free
 cash
 flow
 2.37
 versus


2.21.


So


similar
 to
 United
 and
 Delta,


the
 consumer
 companies
 around
 travel
 are


not
 really
 showing
 that
 much
 weakness.


They're
 not
 showing
 that
 much
 weakness.


3Q
 adjusted
 EPS
 again
 tops
 the
 core


estimates
 and
 that's
 why
 you
 got


Southwest
 that's
 going
 green.
 United


they
 had
 United
 said
 that
 Q3
 was
 going


to
 be
 or
 Q4
 was
 going
 to
 be
 their
 best


quarter
 ever
 in
 terms
 of
 operating


income.
 United
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 after


hours.
 Delta
 also
 said
 the
 consumer
 is


very
 healthy.
 So
 you're
 getting
 a
 lot
 of


these
 consumer
 companies
 come
 out.
 Levi


said
 the
 same
 thing
 and
 you're
 not


seeing
 that
 much
 pain
 on
 them.
 A
 lot
 of


these
 momentum
 names
 folks
 are
 still


down
 after
 hours.
 Oaklo
 is
 down
 another


1.7.
 D-Wave
 is
 down
 4%
 after
 hours.


The
 S&P
 is
 down
 50
 cents.
 So,
 it's
 not


like
 there's
 a
 market
 downturn
 that's


that's
 causing
 this.
 Bit
 mine's
 flat


after
 hours.
 Bit
 mine
 did
 close
 at
 48.


Um
 closed
 at
 4750.
 Galaxy
 down
 12%
 down


another
 1%
 after
 hours
 or
 down.3%.
 And


then
 Nebius
 also
 down
 half
 a
 percent.


So,
 some
 of these
 data
 center
 names


continuing
 to
 get
 hit
 after
 hours
 as


well.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 and
 for
 these


speculative
 names
 are
 some
 of
 them
 are


not
 speculative,
 right?
 Some
 do
 have


certain
 businesses
 but
 at least
 for
 that


trend
 on
 the
 bright
 end
 we
 do
 have
 kind


of
 big
 tech
 reporting
 earnings
 I
 think


next
 week.
 So
 if
 they
 talk
 anything


about
 capital
 expenditure
 growth
 in
 data


center
 that
 could
 be
 a
 nice
 momentum


shift
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 companies.
 uh


unfortunately
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


going
 to
 happen
 but
 unfortunately
 if
 the


opposite
 happens
 and
 you
 kind
 of
 see
 a


little
 bit
 of
 hiccup
 in
 in
 capix
 which


again
 I
 don't
 think
 is
 going
 to
 happen


but
 if
 it
 does
 um
 some
 of
 those
 momentum


stocks
 can
 can
 also
 feel
 the
 pain
 uh


with
 commentary
 from
 big
 tech
 later
 this


next
 week.


>> Do do
 you
 think
 big
 tech
 could
 give


really
 good
 commentary
 about
 capex
 and


these
 momentum
 stocks
 that
 are
 like
 in


the
 AI
 capex
 ecosystem
 still
 get
 hit


because
 they're
 just
 there's
 too
 much


baked
 into
 their
 prices.
 I


>> I
 think
 it
 depends.
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 it
 the


it's


at
 least
 in
 the
 data
 center
 players.
 Um


the
 ones
 that
 actually
 have
 a
 contract
 I


think
 have
 a
 higher
 chance
 of
 turning


things
 around
 with
 good
 commentary.
 The


ones
 that
 maybe
 don't
 have
 uh
 contracts


with
 big
 players.
 That
 one
 I
 think
 it's


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 coin
 flip.
 Uh
 so
 we
 know


companies
 like
 Coreweave,
 companies
 like


Nebas.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 if
 Iron
 does,
 but
 uh


some
 other
 players
 also
 kind
 of
 have


that
 partnership
 already
 within
 within


some
 of
 these
 big
 companies.


>> Folks,
 Molina
 Healthcare
 is
 down
 16%.


Oh
 boy,
 there's
 something
 happening
 in


healthcare.
 I'll
 try
 to
 figure
 out


what's
 going
 on.
 Oscar
 is
 down
 4%
 as


well
 because
 of
 that.
 UNH
 is
 down
 1%


because
 of
 that.
 I
 guess
 Molina
 had


earnings


and
 the
 earnings
 weren't
 good,
 I
 would


imagine.


Um,


Molina
 Healthcare,


good
 news.
 16%


getting
 hit.
 Yeah,
 earnings
 miss.
 Okay,


so
 they
 missed
 on
 earnings,
 but
 it
 looks


like
 their
 guidance
 is
 really
 ugly,


especially
 for
 Q4.
 Our
 Medicaid
 business


continues
 to
 perform
 well
 in
 a


challenging
 medical
 cost
 environment.


The
 headline
 for
 the
 quarter
 is
 that


approximately
 half
 of
 our


underperformance
 is
 driven
 by
 the


marketplace
 business
 and
 that
 Medicaid,


while
 experiencing
 some
 pressure,
 is


producing
 strong
 margins.
 We
 continue
 to


grow.
 We
 believe
 the
 margin
 challenges


will
 not
 persist
 and
 we
 are
 encouraged


by
 margin
 improvement
 potential
 in
 2026.


There
 you
 go.
 184
 EPS
 miss


uh
 it's
 down
 70%
 year-over-year
 revenue


they
 did
 beat
 slightly
 10
 point
 11.4


versus
 10.3
 CNC
 is
 getting
 hit
 hard
 as


well
 right
 yeah
 CNC
 UNH


all
 these
 guys


>> there
 was
 also
 an
 article
 that
 came
 in


about
 10
 minutes
 ago
 that
 Reuters
 OpenAI


with
 Oracle
 and
 Vantage
 data
 center
 will


develop
 a
 data
 center
 campus
 in


Milwaukee
 um
 Wisconsin
 as
 part
 of
 the


Stargate
 project.
 Uh
 the
 company
 said
 on


Wednesday,
 I
 didn't
 see
 the
 actual


report
 from
 OpenAI.
 Um
 but
 we
 do
 have


kind
 of
 like
 a
 other
 Stargate
 project


being
 announced.
 Open
 AAI
 Oracle


Advantage
 15
 billion
 Stargate
 data
 hub


in
 Wisconsin.


4,000
 skilled
 construction
 jobs


expected.


Dude,
 they
 are
 they
 just
 going
 to
 open
 a


data
 center
 everywhere?
 Is
 that's
 what


is
 that,
 Jose?
 Is
 that
 what
 they're


going
 to
 do?
 Like
 just
 everywhere?


>> I
 I
 I
 think
 so.
 I
 mean,
 uh,
 like
 I


mentioned,
 I
 think
 last
 week,
 I
 talked


about
 it
 that
 Nvidia,
 there's
 this


startup
 company
 that's
 trying
 to
 build


them
 into
 in
 in
 freaking
 space.
 Uh,
 so


it's
 it's
 crazy
 what
 the
 market
 wants
 to


do
 with
 data
 centers
 right
 now.


Okay,
 there
 you
 go.
 Uh,
 so
 more
 data


center
 news
 right
 there.
 Beyond
 Meat,
 I


think,
 is
 still
 taking
 a
 beating
 after


hours.
 Wow.
 290.


I
 mean,
 there
 was
 someone
 who
 bought
 it


today
 at
 $5,
 at
 $6,
 at
 6:30,
 at
 640,
 at


450,
 at
 750.
 There
 was
 someone
 who


bought
 it
 at
 8:50,
 actually,
 at
 5:40


a.m.


>> Like,
 what
 what
 are
 they
 doing?
 Why
 is


this
 happening?
 Why
 are
 people
 chasing


these?
 Like,


>> it
 is
 incredible
 to
 see
 this
 time
 and


time
 again.
 This
 continues
 to
 happen.


I
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 just
 everybody
 in
 the


past
 few
 months,
 right?
 Everybody's


getting
 excited
 about
 these
 momentum


plays
 and
 then
 you
 get
 sad
 that
 you
 miss


some
 of
 them.
 Uh
 so
 you're
 like,
 "Oh,


this
 is
 the
 next
 one."
 So,
 um
 I
 think


it's
 just
 a
 cycle
 of
 greed.
 Yeah.


Someone
 above
 average,
 Joe.
 It's
 just


people
 that
 probably
 missed
 some
 of
 the


great
 returns
 the
 past
 few
 months
 are


trying
 to
 get
 their
 returns
 right
 now.


>> Yeah,
 I
 would
 I
 would
 imagine
 so.
 And
 I


don't know,
 does
 Beyond
 Meat
 go
 back
 to


eight
 bucks?
 Like,
 is
 this
 just
 taking
 a


breather?
 Is
 is
 this
 a
 pump
 and
 dump?


Like
 this
 is
 is
 the
 stuff
 that's
 hard
 to


figure
 out,
 but
 it
 definitely
 is
 not
 the


easiest
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 to
 navigate.


>> Someone
 in
 your
 comments
 posted
 uh
 they


just
 need
 to
 open
 up
 a
 data
 center
 and


that's
 it.


>> Dude,
 I
 feel
 like
 Beyond
 Meat
 could


easily
 do
 a
 partnership
 with
 OpenAI
 and


they
 could
 talk
 about
 AI
 helping
 their


logistics
 and
 procuring
 meat
 and
 all


this
 stuff.


But,
 you
 know,
 the
 Walmart
 partnership,


I
 guess,
 was
 enough
 to
 do
 what
 they


needed
 to
 do.
 Um,


all
 right.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 have
 some
 of


these
 other
 earnings
 right
 now.
 So,
 we


looked
 at
 Southwest.
 Uh,
 we
 looked
 at


Netflix
 today.
 Jose,
 any
 thoughts
 on


Netflix?
 Is
 this
 a
 stock
 you
 at
 all
 care


about
 or


>> No,
 yesterday,
 I
 mean,
 there
 were
 three


earnings
 yesterday
 that
 I
 really


followed.
 Texas
 Instrument,
 um,
 Galaxy,


and
 I
 forgot
 the
 third
 one
 that
 I
 I
 I


kind
 of
 was
 paying
 attention
 to,
 but,


uh,
 Netflix
 was
 not
 one
 I
 I
 I
 wanted
 to


listen
 to
 because
 I
 was
 scared
 that
 they


were
 going
 to
 say
 they
 were
 increasing


my
 my
 subscription
 prices.


>> Yeah,
 enough
 is
 enough
 at
 this
 point.


Enough
 is
 enough.
 Uh,
 TXN,
 did
 they
 say


anything
 that
 kind
 of
 put
 you
 off
 guard?


I
 know
 it
 wasn't
 the
 best
 earnings,
 but


it
 also
 wasn't
 horrible
 either.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 here
 for
 kind
 of
 like
 the


analog
 market,
 they
 did
 mention
 that
 um,


this
 market
 recovery
 is
 one
 of
 the


slowest
 they've
 seen.
 Uh
 so
 obviously
 we


get
 the
 excitement
 in
 the
 AI
 space
 but


every
 other
 aspect
 of
 the
 semiconductor


industry
 is
 still
 growing
 pretty
 slowly.


They
 mentioned
 you
 have
 to
 go
 back
 in
 h


a
 long
 time
 in
 history
 to
 see
 kind
 of
 a


slower
 cycle
 slower
 re
 regrowth
 cycle


than
 this.
 Um
 but
 they
 did
 mention
 that


they're
 going
 to
 start
 showing
 their
 AI


segment
 for
 the
 next
 quarter
 or
 the
 next


two
 quarters
 I
 forget.
 Um
 because
 that


market
 for
 them
 is
 growing
 at
 50%.
 Um,


so
 hopefully
 that
 momentum
 is
 going
 to


uh
 produce
 maybe
 some
 results
 here
 for


Texas,
 but
 Texas
 is
 not
 a
 stock
 that
 I


personally
 like.
 I
 would
 rather
 I
 think


this
 is
 more
 of
 like
 a
 market
 performer


than
 the
 market
 beater.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 I
 would
 agree
 with
 that.


The
 other
 thing
 that's
 really
 important


about
 some
 of
 these
 semiconductor


companies
 is
 just
 like
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


signal
 into
 what
 we
 think
 we
 get
 from


Nvidia.
 And
 I
 think
 with
 TSM
 and
 ASML,


we've
 already
 gotten
 a
 pretty
 decent


signal,
 but
 obviously
 we're
 going
 to


need
 to
 see


what
 Nvidia
 comes
 up
 with
 in
 terms
 of


their
 results.


Um,
 looking
 at
 some
 more
 stuff
 with


Tesla,
 guys.


I
 don't
 think
 there's
 anything
 else


that's
 that
 crazy
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 story.


Couple
 of
 points
 here.
 We
 launched
 the


Model
 Y
 L
 in
 China.
 This
 this
 actually


did
 do
 very
 well.
 A
 longer
 wheelbase


version
 of
 the
 Model
 Y
 with
 six
 seats


and
 three
 rows,
 expanding
 our
 product


portfolio
 in
 the
 critical
 market.
 We


achieved
 record
 deliveries
 in
 South


Korea,
 Taiwan,
 Japan,
 and
 Singapore
 and


began
 deliveries
 of
 the
 Model
 Y
 in


India.
 South
 Korea
 is
 now
 our
 largest


market
 behind
 the
 US
 and
 China.
 Wow.


Serving
 as
 a
 validation
 of
 our


competitive
 positioning
 in
 a
 robust
 EV


market.
 Yeah.
 You
 didn't


>> I
 didn't
 think
 South
 Korea
 would
 be


their
 biggest
 or
 the
 third
 largest


market,


but
 apparently
 that
 is.
 We
 launched
 FSD


supervised
 in
 Australia
 and
 New
 Zealand


and
 continuing
 to
 prepare
 for
 a
 broader


launch
 in
 China
 pending
 regulatory


approval.
 Um,
 Model
 Y
 is
 the
 bestselling


vehicle
 in
 Norway,
 Switzerland,
 and


Iceland
 year
 to
 date.
 And
 Finland
 for
 Q3


in
 the
 Netherlands
 and
 Denmark
 in


September.


Dude,
 I
 thought
 Europe
 to
 this
 guy.


>> I
 thought
 I
 like
 what
 they
 say
 in
 the


next
 slide
 when
 talking
 about
 software


developments.
 Um
 they
 mention
 in
 the
 la


next
 paragraph
 the
 last
 sentence
 um
 they


have
 about
 81,000
 now
 uh
 H100
 equivalent


uh
 training
 compute
 capacity
 for
 both


inference
 and
 training
 here
 in
 the


United
 States
 which
 I
 think
 is
 crazy.


They
 definitely
 have
 a
 massive
 massive


uh
 AI
 infrastructure.


>> Jose
 where
 is
 dojo
 and
 do
 you
 think
 it


still
 can
 compete
 with
 Nvidia
 as
 some


people
 thought
 a
 long
 time
 ago?


You
 know,
 I
 mean,
 the
 way
 Elon
 used
 to


talk
 about
 Dojo
 uh
 back
 then
 was
 that
 it


was
 going
 to
 be
 meant,
 it
 was
 going
 to


be
 a
 chip
 that
 was
 really
 going
 to
 be


good
 at
 video
 analyzing.
 Um,


most
 recently,
 Nvidia
 has
 announced
 some


pretty
 cool
 things
 that
 are
 really
 good


for
 video
 AI.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 anymore.


Um,
 I
 think
 Elon
 will
 continue
 to


develop
 that
 side
 and
 like
 he
 does,
 he's


going
 to
 have
 his
 own
 chips
 and
 he's


going
 to
 buy
 Nvidia
 chips
 and
 I
 think


that's
 going
 to
 continue.
 Uh,
 but
 with


the
 recent
 new
 chip
 that
 Nvidia


announced,
 the
 CX
 I
 forget
 CPX9,
 I


forget
 the
 actual
 name
 of
 it.
 Uh,
 but


it's
 meant
 to
 handle
 long
 long
 video
 and


that's
 what
 El
 um
 Elon
 really
 needs
 for


his
 car,
 right?
 and
 you
 have
 like
 six,


eight
 cameras
 each
 recording
 uh
 when


you're
 doing
 FSD
 for
 multiple
 frames,


multiple
 minutes,
 hour
 trips,
 uh
 you


need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 understand
 all
 that


information.
 So,
 they
 can
 continue,
 but


um
 I
 think
 Nvidia
 is
 definitely


producing
 some
 pretty
 cool
 stuff.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 mean
 Elon
 also
 said
 I
 think


he
 said
 it's
 a
 he
 said
 it's
 a
 very
 low


probability
 Dojo
 will
 end
 up
 replacing


some
 of
 our
 needs
 of
 compute.
 said
 this


I
 think
 back
 in
 end
 of
 2023


um
 but
 he
 did
 say
 it
 was
 worth
 pursuing


and
 you
 know
 that's
 why
 they
 still
 have


the
 competi
 capacity
 that
 they
 have
 S&P


right
 here
 after
 hours
 relatively
 flat


66756


Google
 still
 251
 AMD
 down
 about
 3%
 on


the
 day
 Palanter
 still
 down
 3%
 hoodie


did
 get
 a
 little
 recovery
 from
 122
 to


126
 Tesla
 folks
 it
 really
 feels
 like
 one


of
 the
 most
 boring
 Tesla
 earnings
 ever


in
 terms
 of
 the
 stock
 price
 action
 which


is
 probably
 a
 good
 thing
 for
 those
 that


are
 long
 Um
 because
 if
 you've
 been


buying
 this
 thing
 at
 240
 and
 below
 in


April
 and
 March,
 I
 think
 215
 was
 the


lowest.
 I
 mean,
 you
 you've
 had
 a
 pretty


nice
 move.
 If
 you
 got
 it
 at
 450,
 you're


probably
 upset.
 But
 like
 outside
 of


that,
 just
 holding
 the
 430s
 with


negative
 30%
 earnings
 growth,
 holding
 a


$ 1.5
 trillion
 market
 cap,
 I
 feel
 like


is
 a
 win,


which
 means
 you
 can't
 be
 can't
 be
 too


upset
 about
 it.
 Um,


Oscar's
 down
 another
 5%
 because
 Molina


Healthcare,
 which
 is
 another
 company
 in


the
 healthcare
 space,
 took
 a
 hit,
 down


16%.
 So,
 Oscar,
 this
 is
 the
 thing
 about


Oscar,
 right?
 Like,
 you
 have
 to


understand
 the
 healthcare
 market.
 I
 I


personally
 believe
 it's
 hard
 to
 invest


in
 something
 like
 a
 Oscar
 if
 you
 don't


understand
 the
 healthcare
 ecosystem.


It's
 hard
 to
 invest
 in
 a
 Micron
 if
 you


don't
 understand
 memory
 storage.
 So,


same
 thing
 with
 Oscar
 right
 here.
 If


Molina's
 getting
 hit,
 then
 Oscar's
 going


to
 get hit.
 Now,
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 Oscar


deserves
 to
 be
 down.
 It
 just
 means
 that


because
 it's
 in
 the
 same
 sector,
 CNC,


UNH,
 etc.,
 all
 these
 guys


will
 take
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 tumble.


Um,


that's
 what
 we
 got.
 City
 initiates


coverage
 on
 Visa
 with
 a
 buy
 rating,
 450


price
 target,
 citing
 its
 network
 scale,


payments
 dominance,
 and
 strong
 brand
 as


formidable
 modes.
 I
 think
 the
 stable


coin
 stuff
 is
 also,
 you
 know,
 starting


to
 be
 a
 tailwind
 for
 Visa,
 more
 than
 a


headwind.


So,
 that
 could
 be
 another
 reason
 why


we're
 getting
 those
 price
 targets.
 All


right.
 So,
 what
 do
 we
 think
 in
 the
 chat?


If
 you
 had
 to
 put
 out
 a
 few
 words
 or
 a


sentence
 to
 describe


your
 thoughts
 on
 this
 earnings.


Let's
 see
 what
 people
 are
 thinking.


Call
 is
 at
 5:30.
 Calls
 at
 in
 about
 40


minutes.


Man,
 he
 takes
 his
 time
 for
 the
 call,


right?
 Most
 people
 This
 guy
 wants
 making


us
 wait.


>> Unimpressed.
 Terrible.
 Terrible.


Snoozefest.
 Run-of-the-mill.


Dude,
 the
 call's
 going
 to
 be
 worse,
 bro.


The
 call
 is
 going
 to
 be
 so
 boring.
 Do


you
 guys
 remember
 last
 time?
 I
 think
 you


were
 there,
 Jose,
 last
 time.
 It
 was


boring.
 Like,
 I
 almost
 like
 fell
 asleep.


Like,
 it
 was
 actually


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 I
 think
 I
 had
 to
 leave
 for


the
 same
 reason
 today.
 I
 I
 usually
 take


my
 little
 one
 to
 swimming
 uh
 class.
 So,


uh
 he
 might
 save
 me
 from
 the
 Elon
 uh


Elon
 stuff.


>> I
 think
 he
 is
 gonna
 save
 you,
 bro.
 I


mean,
 like
 Elon


Elon
 sounded
 like
 he
 just
 woke
 up,
 bro.


And
 he
 didn't
 want
 to
 be
 there.
 So,
 he


was
 just
 talking
 in
 long
 sentences
 and
 I


think
 he
 made
 a
 couple
 jokes
 that
 were


so
 cringe,
 but
 like


everyone
 still
 uh
 at least
 had
 some


entertainment
 there.


Uh
 Matt
 says
 it's
 it's
 like
 watching


paint
 dry.


Cash
 currents
 puts
 are
 printing.
 That's


correct.


As
 long
 as
 he
 doesn't
 Elon
 doesn't
 sound


like
 he's
 about
 to
 cry,
 it'll
 be
 fine
 in


the
 long
 run.
 Elon,
 by
 the
 way,
 speaking


of
 Tesla,
 has
 been
 throwing
 a
 lot
 of


shots
 today.


>> Yeah,
 I
 saw
 he
 shot
 at
 almost
 every
 AI


company
 in
 in in
 one
 post.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 you
 saw
 that
 one.


>> I
 saw
 that
 one.
 And
 then
 this
 one,
 he


said,
 "At
 this
 point,
 I
 am
 not


advocating
 any
 particular
 candidate
 for


NASA
 administrator.
 I'm
 just
 just


desperate
 for
 someone
 with
 a
 three-digit


IQ."


So,
 you
 know,
 he's
 definitely
 not
 uh


happy
 with
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 NASA.


And
 then
 here's
 what
 he
 said
 right
 here


around
 AI.
 As
 expected,
 any
 given
 AI


company
 will
 be
 the
 opposite
 of
 its


name.
 Uh,
 OpenAI
 is
 closed.
 Stability
 is


unstable.
 Midjourney
 is
 in
 mid,
 which
 is


kind
 of
 a
 compliment,
 right?


>> Yeah,
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 I
 wonder
 if
 he


was
 complimenting
 that
 one.


>> That's
 a
 little
 nice.
 Uh,
 anthropic
 is


misanthropic
 and
 then
 Claude
 is
 pure


evil.


And
 the
 reason
 for
 this
 was
 because


someone
 said,
 "Here's
 how
 Claude
 Sonnet


4.5
 trades
 off
 terminal
 illnesses


sufferers
 across
 countries.
 Nigerians


are
 worth
 27
 times
 as
 much
 as
 Germans.


And
 with
 GPT4,


there's
 a
 ranking
 order
 of
 different


countries.


I
 don't
 even
 understand
 what
 this
 means.


LLM's
 trading
 off
 different
 lives.
 I


have
 no
 idea.
 I
 have
 not
 looked
 into


anything
 like
 this,
 but
 I
 would
 have
 to


read
 this
 article
 to
 understand
 it
 what


this
 even
 means."


yet
 Elon
 says
 they're
 evil
 as
 a
 result


of
 that.


>> And
 and
 the
 crazy
 thing,
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 not


trying
 to
 offend
 anybody,
 but
 it's
 like


you
 have
 to
 also
 hope
 they
 would
 produce


the
 prompts
 that
 were
 used.
 Uh
 so
 then


people
 can
 kind
 of
 understand
 what
 what


were
 they
 trying
 to
 say?
 What
 were
 they


trying
 to
 get
 the
 system
 to
 do?
 Um


but
 but
 yeah,
 again,
 I
 didn't
 I
 didn't


follow
 that
 either.
 I
 just
 saw
 he
 was


taking
 shots
 at
 every
 AI
 company
 out


there
 except
 in
 the
 journey.
 Do
 you


think
 Elon's
 gotten
 to
 the
 point
 where


he
 does
 not
 care
 anymore?
 Like
 he
 just


knows
 that
 people
 will
 buy
 his
 stock
 no


matter
 what.
 He's,
 you
 know,
 likely
 too


powerful
 to
 go
 to
 jail
 or
 anything
 like


that.
 Do
 you
 think
 he's
 just
 like,
 I'm


going
 to
 do
 whatever
 I
 want
 to
 do
 now?


>> Uh,
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 mean,
 it's
 all
 about


what
 he
 cares
 about,
 right?
 If
 he
 cares


about
 money,
 he
 shouldn't
 have
 because


he
 has
 it
 all
 pretty
 much
 all.
 So,
 if
 if


it's
 main
 it's
 all
 about
 his
 main
 goal


and
 what
 makes
 him
 tick.
 Um,
 if
 money


makes
 him
 tick,
 I
 think
 he
 could
 care


less.
 If
 people
 liking
 him
 make
 him


tick,
 then
 I
 think
 he
 cares
 a
 lot
 of


what
 what
 what
 he
 says.
 Uh,
 so
 it's
 all


of
 of
 what
 drives
 the
 man
 or
 the
 person.


>> Yeah,
 I
 would
 agree.
 I
 also
 think,
 you


know,
 he's
 earned
 the
 right
 to
 not
 care


that
 much
 anymore
 about
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff


and
 he's
 busy
 getting
 stuff
 done.
 But
 I


also
 think
 he
 apologizes
 a
 decent
 amount


when
 he
 says
 something
 that
 like


obviously
 goes
 the
 wrong
 way.
 And
 so


it's
 it's
 at
 this
 point
 of
 his
 life


where
 he
 just
 doesn't
 care
 and
 he's


probably
 not
 going
 to
 care.
 Now
 the


question
 is,
 is
 that
 bad
 for


shareholders?
 And
 I
 given
 this
 new


compensation
 package,
 I
 don't
 think
 it


is.
 I
 mean,
 do
 you
 do
 you
 think
 Elon


deserves
 to
 get
 a
 trillion
 dollars
 if
 he


gets
 the
 stock
 up
 to
 10
 trillion?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 yeah.
 I
 mean,
 if
 he's
 it's


again,
 if
 he's
 there
 um
 maybe
 not


working
 directly,
 but
 the
 ability
 to
 be


able
 to
 um
 delegate,
 pick
 the
 right
 team


is
 what
 makes
 a
 company.
 You
 can't
 not


not
 anybody
 can
 do
 that.
 If
 if
 so,
 you


would
 have
 all
 these
 crazy
 air


companies.
 So,
 you
 have
 to
 give
 the
 guy


some
 some
 credit.
 And
 if
 the


shareholders
 approve
 it,
 then
 why
 would


would
 it
 be
 uh
 why
 should
 there
 be
 any


questions
 about
 it?


>> Yeah,
 I
 don't
 see
 the
 argument.
 I
 don't


see
 the
 argument
 against
 not
 giving
 him


the
 money.
 It's
 like
 if
 he
 10xes
 the


stock,
 like
 okay,
 he
 makes
 a
 trillion,


but
 you
 get
 a
 10x,
 too.


Maybe
 maybe
 your
 100,000
 becomes
 a


million.
 It's
 like,
 okay,
 you
 don't
 have


a
 trillion
 dollars,
 but
 like
 you
 can't


hate
 on
 the
 guy
 who
 has
 a
 trillion
 if


he's
 the
 reason
 you
 even
 got
 here
 in
 the


first
 place.
 Um,
 here's
 a
 little
 bit


more
 coverage
 on
 what
 we've
 got
 with


some
 of
 Tesla's
 earnings


>> to
 data
 export
 issues
 making
 them
 not


able
 to
 have
 their
 latest
 full


self-driving
 software
 in
 China
 at
 any


given
 time.
 So,
 I
 think
 Tesla
 is
 not


coming
 from
 as
 big
 of
 a
 first
 mover


advantage.
 And
 so,
 while
 we
 think


they're
 likely
 to
 grow
 and
 maintain
 a


big
 uh
 share
 of
 the
 ride
 hailing
 market


in
 the
 US
 over
 time,
 we
 do
 think
 that
 it


won't
 happen
 starting
 next
 year.
 We


still
 think
 testing
 is
 in
 the
 early


stages
 and
 we
 think
 the
 recent
 market


rally
 is
 pricing
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 the


optimism,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 upside
 assuming


Tesla
 gains
 market
 share
 next
 year
 and


becomes
 successful
 entry
 into
 robo
 taxi


and
 we
 should
 see
 a
 smaller
 valuation


opportunity
 for
 Tesla
 here.


>> I
 I
 and
 look
 even
 if


>> that
 guy
 was
 screaming
 at
 us.
 I
 don't


know
 why
 he
 I
 I I
 felt
 him
 coming


through.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 All right.
 My


bad.


>> Pause.


it.
 Well,
 yeah,
 I
 think
 his
 uh
 his
 uh


his
 room
 has
 too
 big
 of
 an
 echo
 and


that's
 why
 there's
 the
 mic
 was
 just
 him


yelling.
 But
 even
 if
 he's
 right
 about


that,
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 because
 the


street
 cares
 more
 about,
 you
 know,
 the


trajectory
 of
 their
 story
 on
 growth


versus
 if
 we're
 pulling
 forward
 demand.


Here's
 uh
 an
 update
 from
 the
 White
 House


on
 the
 idea
 of
 the
 White
 House
 curbing


export
 controls
 on
 China
 with
 products


made
 by
 US
 software.
 This
 was
 the
 reason


most
 likely
 the
 market
 took
 hit
 today.


that
 report
 earlier
 today
 that
 the
 US
 is


considering
 software
 curbs
 uh
 for
 China


uh
 in
 retaliation
 for
 the
 Chinese
 action


on
 trade.
 The
 Treasury
 Secretary
 said


yes
 uh
 they
 are
 considering
 uh
 those


kinds
 of
 software
 curbs.
 He
 said


everything
 is
 on
 the
 table.
 Uh
 he
 was


also
 asked
 about
 Russia
 sanctions
 and
 he


signaled
 uh
 that
 something
 significant


may
 be
 coming.
 Here's
 what
 the
 Treasury


Secretary
 had
 to
 say
 just
 a
 short
 time


ago.


We
 are
 going
 to
 either
 announce
 after


the
 close
 this
 afternoon
 or
 first
 thing


one
 second
 please


>> or
 first
 thing
 tomorrow
 morning
 the
 a
 a


substantial
 uh
 pickup
 in
 Russia


sanctions.


>> So
 there
 you
 heard
 the
 Treasury


Secretary
 saying
 he's
 going
 to
 announce


a
 substantial
 pickup
 uh
 in
 Russia


sanctions.
 He
 didn't
 specify
 what
 that


is,
 Scott.
 Uh
 there
 have
 been
 a
 number


of
 discussions
 uh
 in
 Washington
 around
 a


bill
 up
 on
 Capitol
 Hill
 to
 increase


sanctions
 on
 those
 who
 import
 Russian


oil.
 Uh
 not
 clear
 if
 that
 would
 be
 part


of
 what
 this
 what
 the
 Treasury
 Secretary


uh
 is
 talking
 about,
 but
 he
 did
 say
 it


could
 come
 after
 the
 close
 today.
 So


that
 is
 uh
 in
 just
 about
 20
 minutes


time.


>> Well,
 we'll
 watch
 all
 of
 that.
 Um


obviously
 the
 software
 news
 uh
 seems
 to


be
 the
 most
 relevant
 I
 think
 to
 how
 the


markets
 may
 take
 that.
 What's


interesting,
 Aean,
 like
 a
 name
 like


Microsoft


>> Yeah.


>> is
 up
 still
 up
 twothirds
 of
 of
 1%.
 Um


I've
 read
 some
 other
 things
 about
 a
 a


software
 component
 that
 Intel
 has
 in
 in


addition
 to
 chips.
 That
 stock's
 down
 3%.


But
 we'll
 see
 what
 ends
 up
 coming
 from


that
 and
 if
 it
 has
 the
 same
 impact
 on


some
 of
 the
 software
 players
 as
 it
 has


at
 times
 over
 the
 the
 chip
 names
 which


have
 obviously
 been
 in
 the
 news
 related


to
 the
 same
 sort
 of
 headlines.


>> Yeah.
 And
 this
 is
 tricky
 for
 investors,


Scott,
 because
 as
 you
 weigh
 all
 these


headlines,
 you
 have
 to
 figure
 how
 much


of
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 trade
 saber
 rattling


ahead
 of
 the
 meeting
 next
 week.
 Uh
 and


how
 much
 of
 this
 is
 really
 actually
 on


the
 table
 and
 actually
 likely
 to
 happen.


We
 know
 that
 the
 president
 is
 departing


for
 Malaysia
 on
 Friday.
 We
 know
 that
 the


Treasury
 Secretary
 has
 said
 that
 he'll


be
 having
 meetings
 uh
 with
 the
 Chinese


delegation
 as
 early
 as
 this
 weekend.
 So


all
 of
 this
 next
 couple
 of
 days
 in
 the


runup
 to
 those
 meetings
 could
 be
 both


sides
 jockeying
 for
 position
 in
 those


talks
 saying,
 "Hey,
 you
 know,
 if
 you're


coming
 at
 us
 with
 this,
 as
 a
 reminder,


we
 have
 that
 response
 ready
 to
 go."
 So


you
 have
 to
 take
 all
 of
 that
 into


context
 as
 you
 make
 a
 decision.
 uh
 if


you're
 an
 investor
 looking
 to
 place


money
 on
 this.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 this
 news
 throughout
 the


whole
 day
 was
 just
 weird
 about
 software


in
 the
 US
 getting
 an
 export
 control
 on


products
 that
 they
 make.


And
 it
 feels
 like
 that
 was
 the
 argument


for
 why
 stocks
 took
 a
 hit.
 But
 you're


just
 not
 getting
 clarity


on
 any
 sense
 up
 or
 down
 of
 exactly
 what


it
 means.


But
 it
 looks
 like
 that
 was
 the
 reason.


Speaking
 of
 software,
 Jose,
 did
 you
 see


this
 thing?
 I
 mean,
 Nvidia,
 I
 think
 you


talked
 about
 a
 little
 bit,
 but


StarCloud's
 H100
 power
 satellites,
 data


centers
 in
 space.


>> Yeah,
 pretty
 crazy.


>> I
 mean,
 like
 this
 is
 this
 is
 like
 this


is
 this
 is
 if
 Nvidia
 is
 able
 look
 at


that
 five
 gigawatt
 data
 center
 in
 space.


Do
 you
 think
 that
 could
 be
 the
 future
 of


where
 we
 get
 our
 Compia
 from?
 But
 I
 mean


it
 would
 be
 interesting
 for
 sure.
 Um
 it


definitely
 limit
 My
 question
 is
 what


happens
 if
 it
 breaks?
 Like
 how
 are
 you


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 go
 fix
 it?
 Like
 do


you
 have
 just
 uh
 um


you
 just
 have
 astronauts
 ready
 to
 go
 on


the
 ship
 and
 and
 ready
 to
 fix
 things
 and


they
 know
 how
 to
 fix
 a
 GPU
 if
 something


goes
 bad.
 Uh
 so
 interesting.
 I
 think
 in


this
 is
 a
 render.
 Uh
 the
 company
 doing


this
 is
 called
 StarCloud.
 is
 a
 it's
 a


startup
 company
 that
 Nvidia
 funds
 um


through
 some
 of
 their
 inception


programs,
 but
 uh
 I
 I
 think
 in
 November


they're
 going
 to
 be
 sending
 the
 first


H100.
 They're
 just
 going
 to
 send
 one


chip
 uh
 to
 space
 to
 see
 if
 it
 actually


works.
 So
 obviously
 we're
 still
 in
 the


theory
 aspect
 of
 this,
 but
 uh
 on
 I
 think


it's
 November,
 we're
 seeing
 the
 first
 uh


and
 I
 don't
 know
 who's
 shipping
 it,
 who


they
 have
 contracted
 for
 that.
 Um
 but
 uh


the
 first
 one
 is
 going
 to
 go
 out
 in


November
 um
 to
 see
 if
 we
 can
 actually
 do


it
 in
 if
 it's
 actually
 practical.


>> Yeah,
 this
 is
 getting
 kind
 of
 crazy,


dude.
 This
 is
 getting
 kind
 of
 crazy.
 But


I
 guess
 this
 is
 uh
 a
 new
 part
 of
 the


world
 that
 we
 live
 in.
 Yeah,
 because
 my


question
 would
 be
 like
 I
 mean
 obviously


the
 power
 issue
 seems
 to
 be
 fixed


somehow
 with
 uh
 with
 solar
 and
 and
 and


with
 solar
 energy
 but
 then
 the
 cooling


aspect
 I'm
 not
 a
 whatever
 space


engineer.
 Um
 but
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 there's


no
 movement
 or
 transfer
 of
 heat
 there


because
 nothing
 is
 moving.
 So
 I
 wonder


how
 the
 cooling
 aspect
 of
 it
 goes.
 Um


but
 obviously
 they
 probably
 have
 tons
 of


engineers
 and
 physicists
 are
 that
 are


fixing
 that
 that
 problem.


>> You
 have
 a
 filing
 from
 Tesla.
 Tesla
 says


Trump
 administration
 should
 not
 impose


tariffs
 on
 robots
 or
 industrial
 machines


being
 used
 for
 US
 manufacturing.


I
 mean
 kind
 of
 makes
 sense.
 Don't
 know


if
 Trump's
 going
 to
 care,
 but
 you
 got


Tesla
 definitely
 saying
 they
 don't
 want


to
 get


>> random
 thought.
 I
 wonder
 if
 a
 robot
 a


humanoid
 robot
 comes
 in
 now
 that
 you


have
 to
 like
 are
 you
 going
 to
 end
 up


paying
 the
 same
 type
 of
 fee
 as
 like


uh
 the
 H1
 visa
 or
 something
 right


because
 in
 theory
 it's
 replacing
 a
 human


for
 for
 a
 job
 from
 another
 part
 of
 the


world.
 Uh
 so
 I
 wonder
 what
 kind
 of


aspect
 or
 fees
 are
 going
 to
 be
 used
 if


with
 companies
 moving
 on
 and
 using


robots
 instead
 of
 actual
 people.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 look
 I
 feel
 like
 you
 know


who
 would
 fix
 those
 data
 centers?
 It


would
 be
 robots,
 right?
 It's
 just
 like,


could
 you
 trust
 that
 they
 actually


meaningfully
 are
 able
 to
 send
 them
 into


space
 and
 actually
 get
 the
 job
 done?


Shouldn't
 this
 apply
 to
 all
 sectors?


Yeah,
 theoretically
 that
 could
 also
 play


out.
 Make
 robots
 and
 industrial
 machines


here.
 Why
 reduce
 tariffs
 on
 robots
 to


replace
 American
 human
 jobs?
 I
 think


it's
 about
 the
 feasibility
 of
 could
 we


actually
 make
 the
 robots
 here?
 Like
 I


don't
 know
 what
 Tesla's
 optimist
 supply


chain
 looks
 like,
 but
 I
 would
 be
 I
 would


be
 very
 surprised
 if
 there
 wasn't
 some


level
 of
 China
 involved
 and
 and
 just


even
 in
 the
 actuators
 for
 the
 robots


being
 able
 to
 source
 that
 in
 the
 United


States.
 I
 mean,
 it
 just
 not
 might
 just


not
 be
 the
 easiest
 thing
 for
 them
 to
 do.


>> Um


>> unless
 once
 once
 you
 have
 all
 the


robots,
 then
 you
 can
 make
 them
 with


those
 robots
 and
 that'll
 be
 cheaper.
 So,


you
 just
 pay
 the
 fee
 for
 the
 first


investment,
 but
 then
 after
 that,
 you
 can


just
 make
 robots
 make
 more
 robots.


>> Dude,
 are
 we
 crazy
 to
 think
 the
 robots


are
 like
 legit,
 or
 are
 we
 are
 we
 buying


into
 Elon's
 fantasy?
 Like,
 who
 in
 the


chat
 legit
 legit
 believes
 billions
 of


robots
 will
 be
 on
 the
 planet
 one
 day?
 Or


is
 it
 all
 just
 a
 joke
 that
 we're


entertaining
 ourselves
 with
 for
 now?


I
 feel
 like
 it's
 legit,
 like
 it's
 the


next
 evolution
 of
 humans.


Yeah,
 I
 think
 within
 the
 next
 10
 years,


maybe
 not
 everybody,
 but
 uh
 it
 it'll


definitely
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 common


than
 where
 we're
 a
 a
 lot
 more
 common


than
 what
 we
 see
 now.


>> I
 don't
 see
 a
 world
 in
 which
 humans


don't
 figure
 out
 that
 we
 eventually
 want


to
 automate
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 stuff
 that


people
 don't
 like
 doing
 or
 that
 would
 be


more
 efficient.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 this
 is


basically
 what
 LLMs
 are
 doing
 to


intelligence,
 right?
 like
 do
 I
 need
 to


really
 know
 all
 these
 historical
 facts


when
 I
 can
 just
 ask
 chatbt
 and
 so
 then


the
 question
 becomes
 from
 a
 physical


perspective
 do
 I
 really
 need
 to
 wash
 the


dishes
 if
 there's
 something
 else
 that


can
 do
 it
 for
 me
 and
 I
 can
 go
 live
 like


like
 washing
 the
 dishes
 really
 is


pointless
 bro
 like
 there
 isn't
 a
 point


to
 like
 the
 only
 point
 is
 so
 that
 you


have
 clean
 dishes
 but
 there's
 not
 a
 real


like
 philosophical
 goal
 to
 washing
 the


dishes
 that
 should


>> when
 you
 clean
 the
 dish
 you
 clean
 the


slate
 out
 of
 your
 mind
 as
 well
 you
 You


get
 a
 clear
 mind
 after.


>> That's
 true.
 That's
 true.
 You
 do.


>> That's
 what
 my
 wife
 tells
 me
 to
 force
 me


to
 to
 wash
 the
 dishes.


>> Well,
 there
 you
 go.
 That's
 a
 good
 idea.


She
 was
 smart
 about
 that.
 My
 mom
 taught


me
 how
 to
 do
 laundry
 when
 I
 was
 in


second
 grade.
 Like,
 I've
 legit
 done
 my


laundry
 since
 I
 was
 eight
 years
 old.
 And


I
 I
 do
 kind
 of
 find
 it
 relaxing
 to
 just


like
 go
 and
 do
 your
 laundry
 and
 and


like,
 you
 know,
 get
 the
 job
 done.
 And
 it


feels
 like
 you
 accomplish
 something.
 But


it's
 also
 just
 like,


should
 I
 really
 have
 to
 do
 the
 laundry?


like
 if
 something
 else
 can
 get
 the


laundry
 done,
 you
 could
 be
 doing


something
 else
 at
 the
 time.


That's
 where
 the
 the
 uh
 the
 use
 case


comes
 in,
 at least
 for
 robots.


You
 wash
 the
 dishes
 so
 when
 I
 go
 to


cook,
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 clean
 up
 just
 to


cook.
 It
 drives
 me
 nuts.
 Yeah,
 obviously


washing
 the
 dishes
 is
 important
 for
 your


health,
 but
 I'm
 talking
 about
 like,
 do


humans
 need
 to
 be
 doing
 that
 if
 it
 could


be
 automated?


That's
 the
 question.
 I
 feel
 like
 the


answer
 is
 no.


Um,


you
 can
 do
 my
 laundry
 instead.


Humanoid
 robots
 are
 inefficient
 and


impractical.
 Most
 bots
 will
 continue
 to


be
 task
 specific.
 Well,
 I
 think
 that's


the
 goal
 with
 these
 uh
 combination
 of


action
 language
 models
 and
 then
 the


robot
 itself.
 It's
 like,
 can
 it
 actually


do
 many
 things
 autonomously?
 Even


Figure,
 which
 has
 put
 out
 a
 lot
 more


videos
 than
 Tesla,
 it
 still
 can't
 do


much,
 right?
 It
 can
 do
 some
 stuff
 on
 the


video,
 but
 it
 still
 looks
 like
 it's
 far


away
 from
 doing
 anything
 meaningful.
 And


that's
 why
 I
 think
 the
 Optimus
 update


that
 Elon
 gives
 us,
 you
 know,
 just
 might


not
 be
 filled
 with
 anything
 tangible
 for


the
 street
 to
 care
 about.


>> No.
 And
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 also
 the


power
 of
 AI,
 right?
 It's
 going
 to
 allow


for
 um
 the
 ability
 to


create
 new
 maybe
 not
 in
 this
 concept
 but


in
 a
 top
 create
 new
 code
 for
 the
 robot


whenever
 it
 needs
 to
 make
 a
 new
 task.
 So


it's
 not
 only
 just
 doing
 one
 task
 it


could
 do
 whatever
 you
 need
 it
 to
 do
 but


uh
 obviously
 in
 form
 of
 safety
 you
 don't


want
 it
 to
 just
 create
 something
 out
 of


the
 new
 without
 testing
 it
 because
 then


uh
 you
 end
 up
 with
 some
 Terminator
 style


things.
 Um,
 but
 um
 I
 think
 there's
 some


truth
 between
 not
 getting
 to
 Terminator


and
 having
 a
 robot
 that
 can
 do
 stuff
 for


us.


>> Yeah,
 that
 is
 fair.


That
 is
 very
 fair.
 Is
 Trump
 live
 right


now?


Why
 would
 Trump
 be
 live?
 He
 was
 live


yesterday.
 He's
 going
 to
 Malaysia
 in
 two


days.


I
 don't
 see
 him
 live
 yet,
 but
 we
 might


get
 some
 quotes.
 I'll
 check
 if
 he
 is


live.
 Here
 is
 uh
 Liz
 Thomas
 today
 on


where
 she
 thinks
 the
 state
 of
 the
 bull


market
 continues
 to
 be.


>> The
 fact
 that
 I
 think
 this
 rally
 can


continue
 and
 the
 bull
 market
 can


continue
 but
 it
 won't
 be
 without
 these


intermittent
 breakdowns
 in
 beta
 and
 we


are
 right
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 an


intermittent
 breakdown
 in
 beta
 and
 it's


happening
 the
 way
 that
 you
 would
 expect.


So
 as
 we
 hear
 from
 these
 mag
 seven
 names


I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 affect
 sentiment.


I
 think
 investors
 are
 going
 to
 react
 to


it
 and
 it
 may
 feel
 more
 volatile
 than


usual
 just
 because
 of
 how
 extended
 we


got.
 So
 you
 look
 at
 some
 of the
 factor


performance
 over
 the
 last
 week.
 We've


got
 value
 stocks,
 highquality
 stocks


doing
 well,
 right?
 And
 then
 you
 look
 at


some
 of
 the
 stuff
 that
 hasn't
 done
 well.


Momentum
 has
 really
 taken
 a
 hit.
 So
 a


lot
 of
 those
 crowded
 trades,
 a
 lot
 of


the
 stuff
 that's
 run
 up
 so
 much,
 gold


being
 on
 that
 list
 as
 well.


>> You're
 talking
 about
 froth
 perceived


frothy
 areas
 of
 the
 market.


>> Not
 even
 perceived,
 real,
 right?
 So


real
 froth
 in
 the
 market
 coming
 out.
 So,


as
 the
 Meg
 7
 information
 comes
 out,


you're
 going
 to
 see
 sentiment
 react
 to


that
 more
 than
 anything.
 And
 then
 again,


this
 is
 all
 about
 guidance.
 It's
 all


about
 spending.
 And
 I
 think
 for
 the
 rest


of
 2025,
 it
 will
 continue
 to
 be
 about


spending.
 But
 in
 2026,
 it
 becomes
 where


is
 the
 real
 profit?


>> How
 do
 you
 see
 it?


>> Um,
 nice
 to
 see
 everyone.
 Thanks
 for


having
 me.
 Um,
 look,
 I
 think
 the
 earning


season
 for
 Mag
 7
 is
 going
 to
 be
 you
 need


what
 the
 market
 needs
 is
 Goldilocks
 on
 H


on
 on
 the
 capex.
 So,
 it
 need
 you
 need
 to


believe
 it's
 going
 higher.
 The
 capex
 is


going
 higher.
 Maybe
 not.


>> Is
 there
 anything
 to
 lead
 you
 to
 believe


it's
 not?
 I


>> mean,
 you
 really
 expect
 something


otherwise?


>> No,
 I
 think
 in
 the
 distribution
 of
 it's


flat
 down,
 higher
 or
 way
 higher,
 you
 get


assigned
 probabilities.
 I
 got
 a
 low
 one


to
 flat
 down
 in
 the
 next
 couple


quarters,
 but
 I
 think
 it
 has
 to
 come
 up.


I
 think
 it
 you
 have
 to
 be
 convinced
 that


they're
 still
 very
 uh
 committed
 to
 high


return
 on
 that
 spending.
 Uh
 I
 think


there's
 some
 risk
 that
 they
 they


actually
 spend
 too
 much
 in
 the
 short


term
 and
 freak
 people
 out
 a
 little
 bit.


So,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 not
 saying
 Microsoft's


going
 to
 have
 negative
 cash
 flow


>> asset
 stage.


>> I
 don't
 think
 so.
 And
 I
 don't
 agree
 that


the
 frothing
 is
 an
 interesting
 word.
 I


think
 there's
 froth
 in
 the
 profitless.


You
 know,
 you
 see
 ARC
 down
 5%.
 It's
 a


you
 know,
 a
 low
 quality
 hyperrowth
 proxy


or
 whatever
 Goldman
 basket.
 those


things.
 There's
 froth,
 you
 know,
 the


number
 of
 companies
 that
 are
 up
 100%
 or


more
 in
 6
 months,
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 if


there's
 froth
 in
 the
 Max
 7.
 You
 know,
 I


think
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 different.
 I


don't
 think
 that


>> I
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 Jose.


Do
 you
 think
 there's
 any
 froth
 in
 the


Mac
 7
 besides
 Tesla?


>> I
 am
 going
 to
 say
 I'm
 sorry
 for
 this,


man.
 I
 was
 not
 listening.
 I
 was
 just


reading
 your
 chat
 and
 your
 chat
 was
 just


crazy.
 They
 were
 the
 lady
 supposedly
 was


the
 smartest
 person
 in
 that
 in
 that


stream
 and
 then
 the
 guy,
 he
 was
 just


talking
 nonsense.
 lady
 know
 Liz
 is
 very


smart
 but
 they
 were
 not
 complaining


because
 they
 wanted
 to
 hear
 her
 smart


intake
 again.
 They
 were
 complaining
 that


the
 camera
 moved
 because
 these
 people


are
 crazy.
 So
 that
 was
 the
 different


reason
 that
 they
 were
 complaining
 but
 um


do do
 you
 think
 there
 is
 fro
 7
 or
 are
 we


at
 normal
 multiples?


>> I
 mean
 if


right


>> yeah
 I
 I
 would
 think
 so.
 I
 mean,
 if
 I
 I


would
 like
 personally,
 I
 would
 feel


comfortable
 investing
 in
 most
 of
 the
 Mac


7.
 Um,
 like
 if
 if
 someone
 was
 like,


"Hey,
 you
 have
 all
 this
 money
 right
 now.


Where
 would
 you
 throw
 it?"
 Um,
 where
 um


without
 like
 a
 second
 thought,
 it
 would


be
 uh
 form
 of
 maximum
 player.
 Um
 my
 top


favorite
 ones
 right
 now
 are
 probably


like
 Google,
 Amazon,
 and
 Nvidia.
 Um


within
 that
 list
 right
 now.


>> Yeah,
 I
 would
 agree.
 Those
 would
 be
 some


of my
 favorites
 as
 well.
 By
 the
 way,


Trump
 is
 about
 to
 go
 live
 with
 the


Secretary


of
 NATO.
 Did
 not
 know
 that
 was
 happening


today,
 but
 looks
 like
 that's
 happening.


So,
 we'll
 get
 over
 to
 that
 when
 we
 see


it.
 By
 the
 way,
 just
 want
 to
 give
 a


quick
 shout
 out.
 Uh,
 happy
 birthday
 to


Ray
 and
 Austin.
 Those
 are
 two


>> Happy
 birthday.


>> Yeah,
 two
 of
 my
 mods
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 uh
 I


don't
 know
 if
 they're
 watching
 right


now,
 but
 if
 they're
 watching
 later,


happy
 birthday
 to
 both
 of
 you
 guys.
 Love


you
 both.
 Happy
 that
 you
 are
 October


birthdays.
 October
 babies
 like
 myself.


Um,


>> when's
 your
 birthday?


>> 27th.


Yeah.
 So,
 in
 like
 in
 like
 five
 days.
 So,


they're
 unks
 like
 me,
 bro.
 They're
 Jose,


you're
 an
 too.
 We're
 all,
 bro.


We're
 all
 just
 getting
 older.


Just
 kidding.
 Dude,
 you
 know,
 I
 saw
 a


silver
 hair
 in
 my
 beard
 the
 other
 day.


like
 a
 legit
 silver
 a
 silver
 gray,


whatever
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it.
 Like
 I
 was


like,
 "Oh,
 I'm
 legit
 ank
 now."
 Like
 I'm


actually


>> Don't
 tell
 my
 wife,
 but
 once
 I
 got


married,
 they
 really
 started
 coming
 out.


>> Oh,
 of
 course.
 Of
 course.
 Yeah.
 Stress,


bro.


>> Just
 kidding,
 honey.


Uh,
 are
 you
 a
 Scorpio?
 Yes,
 I'm
 a


Scorpio.
 I
 am
 a
 Scorpio.


I
 think
 Scorpios
 are
 the
 best
 are
 the


best
 uh
 signs.
 Jose,
 do
 you
 know
 your


sign
 at
 all?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I'm
 a
 Virgo.
 August
 29th
 is


my
 birthday.


>> Okay,
 there
 you
 go.


>> Virgo.


>> Yo,
 what
 is
 Elon?
 What
 is
 Elon?
 I
 feel


like
 that
 would
 explain
 something,


right?
 Elon
 is
 a
 freaking


cancer,


huh?


Okay,
 so
 Elon
 is
 a
 cancer.
 There
 we
 go.


Um,
 all right.
 So,
 we
 got
 the
 Tesla
 call


in
 about
 30
 minutes.
 Trump
 will
 be
 live


with
 NATO.
 We'll
 see
 what
 he
 says
 there.


Uh,
 not
 too
 much
 else
 going
 on
 after


hours.
 We
 do
 have
 these
 bescent
 quotes


which
 I
 think
 the
 market's
 still
 trying


to
 fully
 understand.


Uh,


you
 have
 the
 OpenAI
 Stargate
 2.0


announcement.
 Oh,
 this
 this
 one
 right


here
 was
 pretty
 cool.
 Tesla's
 AI


training
 capacity
 hit
 a
 record
 high
 in


Q3.
 They
 now
 have
 120,000
 Nvidia
 H100


GPUs
 worth
 of
 compute
 power.
 Um,
 okay.


Here's
 a
 question,
 Jose,
 and
 this
 is
 for


the
 chat
 as
 well.
 Do
 you
 think


that
 Elon
 will
 talk
 about
 XAI
 today?


Yeah.
 As
 like
 an
 investment
 opportunity


that
 they
 are
 going
 to
 do.


>> Uh,


this
 quarter
 is
 when
 we
 got
 hit
 with
 the


Grock
 update,
 right,
 on
 on
 on
 Teslas.


Um,
 so
 I
 I I
 think
 at
 least
 there's
 a


great
 way
 to
 t
 uh
 to
 tie
 that
 around,


right?
 It's
 like
 what
 are
 you
 paying


Grock
 or
 are
 you
 paying
 how
 much
 money


are
 you
 paying
 XAI
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 this


if
 you're
 paying
 any?
 And
 if
 you
 are


paying
 does
 it
 just
 make
 more
 sense
 to


invest
 in
 the
 company
 instead
 so
 you


don't
 have
 to
 pay
 for
 for
 things
 like


that?
 And
 I'm
 I'm
 going
 to
 guess


eventually
 for
 Optimus
 uh
 you're
 going


to
 have
 some
 form
 of
 Grock
 integration


as
 well.
 So
 at
 what
 point
 does
 it
 make


sense
 to
 have
 that
 synergy
 through
 an


investment?


I
 feel
 like
 this
 should
 have
 happened
 a


long
 time
 ago,
 but
 Elon
 was
 trying
 to


get
 some
 uh
 some
 uh
 leverage.
 I'm
 going


to
 pull
 put
 a
 poll
 right
 here
 in
 the


chat
 on
 how
 many
 people
 think
 that
 Tesla


should
 invest
 in
 XAI.


Um


I
 think
 the
 reason
 Elon
 didn't
 do
 it
 is


because
 he
 wanted
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 he


would
 get
 paid
 first.


And
 you
 know,
 if
 he
 didn't
 officially


get
 paid,
 then
 he
 could
 leave
 and
 go
 do


XAI
 full-time.
 So,
 there's
 always
 that


kind
 of
 threat
 that
 stopped
 people
 from


letting
 him
 go,
 basically.


>> You'd
 think
 he
 would
 I
 mean,
 it's
 weird


to
 say
 something
 full-time
 because
 he


runs
 all
 these
 other
 businesses,
 right?


But,
 uh,
 do
 you
 think
 he
 would
 he
 would


want
 to
 do
 you
 think
 he's
 that
 excited


for


the
 AI
 market
 or
 where
 do
 you
 think
 he


would
 spend
 more
 of
 his
 time
 in
 the


space
 company,
 SpaceX,
 XAI,
 or
 some
 of


the
 the
 boring
 companies
 that
 he
 has?


>> I
 do
 not
 think
 he
 would
 actually
 want
 to


leave
 Tesla
 ever,
 but
 I
 think
 he
 needed


some
 leverage
 just
 in
 case,
 you
 know,


that
 he
 didn't
 get
 the
 compensation


package.
 I
 think
 he
 loves
 Tesla
 the


most.
 I
 think
 he
 cares
 about
 SpaceX.
 I


think
 XAI
 he
 thinks
 is
 important
 but
 XAI


dude
 I
 think
 he
 made
 XAI
 because
 he
 did


not
 want
 to
 see
 Sam
 Alman
 win
 and
 right


now
 Sam
 Altman
 objectively
 is
 winning.


They
 have
 the
 fastest
 growing
 LLM
 800


million
 people
 use.
 So
 it's
 like
 I
 think


he
 really
 wanted
 to
 hedge
 against
 that


and
 long-term
 maybe
 XAI
 is
 going to
 be
 a


big
 winner
 but
 it
 doesn't
 look
 like


they're
 stopping
 Chad.
 really
 doesn't


look
 like.
 And
 quite
 frankly,
 if
 you're


an
 AI
 investor,
 even
 if
 you
 hate
 Sam


Alman,
 you
 got
 to
 hope
 OpenAI
 still


becomes
 a
 multi-trillion
 dollar
 company


because
 all
 these
 other
 companies
 are


tied
 to
 OpenAI
 success.
 There
 was
 a


piece
 in
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 two


days
 ago
 that
 said
 Sam
 Alman
 has


purposely
 constructed
 the
 ability
 of


getting
 Lisa
 Sue
 and
 Larry
 Ellison
 and


Hawk
 Tan
 and
 and
 and
 Jensen
 Hong
 into


his
 ecosystem
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 if
 he


fails,
 they
 fail,
 too.
 So,
 I
 don't
 think


OpenAI
 is
 going
 to
 fail.
 I
 think
 XAI


will
 still
 do
 well,
 but
 I
 don't
 think


he's
 as
 passionate
 about
 LLM
 as
 he
 is


about
 self-driving
 at
 the
 end
 of the


day.


>> And
 I
 I
 would
 say
 while
 Sam
 um
 while
 XAI


does
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 it's
 defeating
 um


open
 AI,
 I
 do
 enjoy
 Grock
 in
 Tesla.
 I


feel
 like
 Grock
 is
 definitely
 pretty
 fun


as
 a
 something
 where
 you
 just
 want
 to
 BS


or
 just
 um


waste
 some
 time,
 right?
 It's
 not
 like


I'm
 I'm
 not
 asking
 Gro
 crazy
 things.


It's
 just
 some
 crazy
 uh
 intellectual


things,
 right?
 And
 I
 I
 I
 wonder
 if


that's
 a
 unique
 place
 where
 you
 can
 go


with
 rock
 and
 with
 kind
 of
 consumerf


facing
 products
 like
 Tesla
 and
 maybe


robotics
 as
 well.


>> Yeah.
 And
 look,
 it's
 nice
 to
 have


something
 that's
 not
 as
 restrictive
 as


OpenAI,
 but
 I
 think
 eventually
 all
 these


LMS
 will
 take
 off
 their
 core


restrictions.
 Lending
 Club,
 by
 the
 way,


apparently
 they
 had
 earnings.
 I'm
 just


looking
 at
 that
 right
 now.
 That
 stock
 is


up
 6%
 after
 hours.
 It's
 good
 for
 SoFi.


Revenue
 up
 32%
 year-over-year,
 226
 or


266
 million.
 Net
 income
 44
 million.


That's
 up
 206%
 year-over-year.
 EPS
 up


185%
 year-over-year
 at
 37
 cents.
 The
 CEO


says,
 "We
 delivered
 another
 outstanding


quarter
 with
 37%
 growth
 in
 originations,


32%
 growth
 in
 revenue,
 and
 nearly


tripling
 diluted
 earnings
 per
 share


resulting
 in
 a
 return
 in
 equity
 on
 over


13%.


So
 for
 those
 in
 the
 SoFi
 ecosystem,
 this


is
 definitely
 something
 bullish
 for


for
 Lending
 Club.
 Yes,
 I
 was
 roasting


Grock
 yesterday
 because
 it's
 just


becoming
 really
 slow
 in
 my
 opinion.
 Uh


but
 look,
 it's
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 it


it's
 going
 to
 it
 Grock,
 Gemini,
 Claude,


all
 these
 guys
 are
 going
 to
 win.
 I
 just


don't
 know if
 they're
 going to
 win
 to


the
 level
 of
 GPT
 that
 has
 the
 amount
 of


users
 that
 it
 has
 right
 now.


And
 I
 think
 GPT
 would
 have
 to
 get
 really


bad
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 users
 to
 kind
 of


leave
 those
 core
 core
 platforms.
 Crypto


is
 getting
 hit
 after
 hours,
 folks.
 We


are
 getting
 some
 pain
 right
 here.


Crypto's
 been
 annoying
 all
 month,
 but


you
 kind
 of
 just
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 the


punches.
 Bitcoin,
 are
 we
 at least
 at


108?
 Bitcoin
 107.
 Low
 107s


dropping
 like
 a
 rock.
 Tesla
 down
 2%


after
 hours.
 And
 ETH,
 unfortunately,


down
 2.4
 before
 BMR
 is
 getting
 hit
 as
 a


result.
 BMR,
 no,
 BMR
 is
 actually
 up.


Okay,
 so
 BMR
 holding
 on
 after
 hours,


but
 ETH
 getting
 hit.


Um,
 Jose,
 at
 this
 point
 of
 your
 uh


investing
 career,
 do
 you
 care
 care
 at


all
 about
 crypto


>> more?


I
 don't
 think
 I
 care
 about
 it
 to
 really


do
 a
 deep
 dive.
 It's
 not
 something
 I


would
 like
 badmouth
 though.
 I
 do
 have
 a


small
 exposure
 in
 like
 BTDT,
 uh,
 BID


digital,
 and
 I
 think
 I
 talked
 about
 that


in
 the
 past.
 Uh,
 but
 I
 think
 that's
 like


my
 closest
 um,
 crypto
 exposure,
 and
 I


think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 closest
 I


had.
 But
 again,
 nothing
 for
 um,
 I
 just
 I


feel
 like
 it's
 too
 hard
 for
 me
 to


understand
 the
 concept.
 Maybe
 I
 should


look
 at
 that
 deep
 dive
 you
 you
 did
 a
 few


months
 ago
 on
 ETH.
 Um,
 but
 yeah,
 nothing


too
 much.


>> Thoughts
 on
 VRT?
 Uh
 JS,
 thanks
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 And
 do
 you
 think
 they
 are


continuing
 to
 play
 a
 role
 in
 the
 data


center
 space?


>> Yes,
 so
 I
 haven't
 looked
 at
 their


earnings
 and
 just
 a
 quick
 plug
 for
 my


channel
 here.
 I'll
 probably
 be
 doing
 a
 a


a
 deeper
 dive
 on
 this
 one
 later
 today
 on


the
 channel.
 Um
 so
 I
 haven't
 looked
 at


it.
 I
 saw
 the
 stock
 price
 was
 up
 after


um
 when
 they
 reported
 earnings
 this


morning.
 Overall,
 we
 keep
 hearing
 the


same
 story
 from
 data
 centers
 players
 is


not
 enough
 energy
 and
 just
 the
 buildout


of
 um
 these
 data
 centers.
 you
 need
 to


have
 the
 overall
 infrastructure
 that


Verde
 has.
 I
 don't
 own
 it,
 but
 I


definitely
 see
 the
 bullish
 case
 behind


it.


>> Yeah.
 And
 there's
 Jose's
 YouTube


channel.
 Again,
 for
 anyone
 who
 cares


about
 any
 of
 the
 semi
 stocks,
 I
 really


would
 subscribe
 to
 Jose.
 Also,
 he
 has
 a


newsletter
 called
 What
 the
 Chip


Happened.
 I'll
 put
 that
 in
 the
 chat
 as


well.


And
 that
 covers
 a
 lot
 of
 the


semiconductor
 ecosystem.
 Uh
 we
 do
 have


some
 news
 on
 oil,
 folks.
 We
 do
 have
 some


news
 on
 oil.


Oh
 boy.


Um,


it
 looks
 like
 the
 US
 Treasury
 has
 just


imposed
 sanctions


on
 Russia.


>> Wasn't
 that
 what
 um
 they
 were
 just


talking
 about
 in
 the
 in
 the
 other
 video


we
 saw?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 it's
 official.
 It
 is


official.
 There
 you
 go.
 Major
 Russian


oil
 companies
 are
 sanctioned.
 And
 the


Department
 of
 the
 Treasury
 Office
 of


Foreign
 Assets
 Control
 is
 imposing


further
 sanctions
 as
 a
 result
 of


Russia's
 lack
 of
 serious
 commitment
 to


peace
 process
 to
 end
 the
 war
 in
 Ukraine.


All right,
 so
 that
 that's
 why
 crypto
 is


falling.
 USRussia
 tensions
 going
 higher.


Today,
 actions
 increase
 pressure
 on


Russia's
 energy
 sector
 and
 degrade
 the


Kremlin's
 ability
 to
 raise
 revenue
 for


its
 war
 machine
 and
 support
 its
 weaken


economy.
 The
 United
 States
 will
 continue


to
 advocate
 for
 a
 peaceful
 resolution
 to


the
 war
 and
 a
 permanent
 peace
 depends


entirely
 on
 Russia's
 willingness
 to


negotiate
 in
 good
 faith.
 Treasury
 will


continue
 to
 use
 its
 authorities
 in


support
 of
 a
 peace
 process.


Oil
 prices
 are
 up
 three
 and
 a
 half%


after
 hours.


>> That
 was
 a
 pretty
 Wow.


Fun
 stuff,
 right?


It's
 every
 day,
 bro.
 There's
 something.


They
 can't
 just
 let
 the
 bull
 market
 have


a
 fun
 2025
 conclusion.
 They
 got
 to
 make


us
 jump
 through
 all
 these
 hoops
 to
 get


to
 the
 end.


I
 want
 to
 say
 this
 is
 the
 fun
 thing


about
 the
 market
 is
 right
 you
 can


like
 any
 part
 of
 anything
 and
 there's
 a


market
 for
 you
 if
 you
 like
 oil
 you
 can


be
 an
 oil
 investor
 and
 understand
 all


these
 crazy
 oil
 companies
 I
 know
 nothing


about
 this
 uh
 right
 or
 um
 the
 fun
 thing


about
 the
 market
 is
 you
 can
 find


everything
 um
 or
 something
 that
 you


enjoy
 investing
 in


>> here
 is
 Bent
 talking
 a
 bit
 more
 about


what's
 going
 on
 with
 Putin


>> as
 you
 know
 and
 the
 the
 world
 can
 see


President
 President
 Trump
 is
 the


president
 of
 peace.
 He's
 done
 peace


deals,
 trade
 deals,
 tax
 deals,
 and
 part


of
 the
 peace
 deal.
 Uh
 the
 real
 remaining


final
 conflict
 in
 the
 world,
 this
 would


be
 the
 ninth
 one
 that
 he
 has
 uh
 found
 a


solution
 to
 would
 be
 between
 Russia
 and


Ukraine.
 Uh
 President
 Putin
 has
 not
 come


to
 the
 table
 uh
 in
 an
 honest
 and


forthright
 manner
 as
 we'd
 hoped.
 There


were
 talks
 in
 Alaska.
 President
 Trump


walked
 away
 uh
 when
 he
 realized
 that


things
 were
 not
 moving
 forward.
 There


have
 been
 behindthe-scenes
 talk,
 but
 I


believe
 that
 the
 president
 is


disappointed
 at
 the
 where
 we
 are
 in


these
 talks.
 So,
 this
 either
 this


evening
 or
 first
 thing
 tomorrow
 morning,


we
 are
 going
 to
 be
 announcing
 a


substantial
 increase
 in
 Russia


sanctions.


>> Well,
 that
 happened
 literally
 five


minutes
 ago.


So
 there
 you
 go.


Yeah.
 In
 terms
 of
 the
 actual


implications
 on
 the
 market,
 I
 I
 don't
 I


mean
 sanctions
 are
 not
 what
 I
 think
 the


market
 cares
 that
 much
 about
 in
 the


context
 of
 Russia,
 but
 crypto
 obviously


will
 take
 a
 hit
 whenever
 you
 get


geopolitical
 headlines.
 Low
 of
 the
 day


was
 106.7.
 We're
 at
 107.2.
 So
 I
 mean
 a


couple
 hundred
 bucks
 and
 we'd
 be
 back
 to


low
 days
 as
 well.
 Is
 this
 not


>> in
 any
 cryptos
 place
 directly?
 I
 know


you
 I
 think
 you're
 BMR.
 Um,
 right.
 But,


uh,
 are
 individual
 cryptos?
 Are
 you
 are


you
 purchasing
 anything?


>> No,
 it
 would
 either
 be
 hood
 or
 BMR.
 That


would
 be
 my
 exposure.
 I
 don't,
 dude,
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 People
 give
 me
 [ __ ]
 for


this
 all
 the
 time,
 but
 I
 I
 don't
 care


about
 owning
 the
 asset.
 Like,
 I
 just


It's
 not
 that
 exciting
 to
 me.
 Like,
 I


want
 to
 sell
 calls.
 I
 want
 to
 get
 in
 and


out
 of
 it.
 I
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 leverage


the
 position.
 Like
 I
 I
 don't
 care
 about


owning
 actual
 Bitcoin
 on
 some
 cold


wallet.
 Like
 I
 I
 don't
 care
 about
 all


that
 [ __ ]
 I
 just
 don't
 care
 or


Ethereum,
 but
 I
 do
 like
 having
 exposure


to
 the
 asset
 itself.


So
 I
 think
 those
 things
 are
 are


important.


But
 yeah,
 someone
 said,
 "Is
 this
 kind
 of


priced
 in?"
 I'm
 like,
 "Yeah,
 to
 an


extent
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 not
 brand
 new


information
 that
 the
 street
 is
 getting."


Bitcoin
 is
 boring.
 I
 don't
 think
 Bitcoin


as
 a
 concept
 is
 boring.
 I
 just
 think
 the


price
 action
 has
 been
 not
 as
 exciting.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 Micro
 Strategy,
 all


these
 derivatives
 have
 been
 kind
 of
 hit.


It
 is
 kind
 of
 wild
 though.
 If
 Bitcoin


doesn't
 get
 up
 to
 115,
 this
 would
 be
 the


the
 the
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 worst
 October
 it's


had
 and
 the
 second
 bad
 October
 in
 12


years.
 Usually,
 it's
 pretty
 green.
 And


then
 you
 got
 Tom
 Lee
 saying
 200,000
 by


end
 of
 year,
 which
 like
 I
 just
 don't
 I


don't
 understand
 exactly
 how
 that
 could


play
 out.
 But
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 other


people
 saying,
 "Hey,
 it
 should
 go


higher."
 There
 you
 go.
 Bitcoin
 106
 very


close
 to
 potentially
 losing
 the


intraday.


It
 just
 seems
 bleak
 right
 now.
 But
 then


again,
 Bitcoin
 has
 these
 $10,000
 candles


that
 like
 no
 one
 can
 explain.
 And
 so
 I


think
 when
 we
 get
 the
 rate
 cuts,
 we're


going to
 see
 how
 that
 plays
 out.
 Let
 me


see
 if
 Trump
 is
 officially
 live.


Um
 he's
 with
 the
 secretary
 general
 of


NATO.
 And
 then
 we
 have
 the
 Tesla
 call
 in


about


20
 minutes.


Oil
 stocks
 could
 skyrocket
 tomorrow.


Yes,
 that
 is
 also
 true,


especially
 based
 on
 this
 news.
 No,


Trump's
 not
 live
 yet.
 Oh,
 never
 mind.
 He


is.
 All
 right,
 hold
 on.


>> Uh
 a
 little
 bit
 easier.
 That's
 turned


out
 to
 be
 tougher
 than
 the
 Middle
 East.


The
 Middle
 East
 was
 supposed
 to
 be
 the


tough
 one
 and
 we've
 solved
 that
 puzzle,


but
 this
 one
 will
 get
 solved
 also.
 So,
 I


want
 to
 just
 say
 it's
 an
 honor
 to
 have


you,
 Mark.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 uh
 for
 hosting


again
 and
 and
 we
 were
 texting.
 I
 think


it
 was
 on
 the
 day
 when
 you
 were
 in


Israel
 and
 in
 Egypt.
 Uh
 this
 tremendous


success
 you
 had
 under
 your
 leadership


bringing
 peace
 to
 the
 Middle
 East.
 Uh


and
 then
 we
 texted
 each
 other
 and
 said,


"And
 the
 next
 big
 thing
 has
 to
 be


Ukraine,
 Russia."
 Uh
 and
 I
 want
 to
 help.


NATO
 wants
 to
 help.
 my
 colleagues
 want


to
 help
 to
 basically
 deliver
 on
 your


vision
 of
 peace
 in
 Ukraine.
 Uh,
 and
 I


really
 want
 to
 thank
 you
 for
 everything


you're
 doing,
 including
 breaking
 the


deadlock
 with
 Putin,
 uh,
 starting
 the


dialogue
 in
 February
 when
 you
 came
 in
 as


president
 in
 January,
 but
 also
 for


everything
 you
 did
 with
 NATO,
 the
 fact


that
 we
 are
 now
 at
 this
 5%
 uh,
 the
 huge


success
 in
 the
 H
 at
 the
 NATO
 summit,
 the


fact
 that
 Europeans
 are
 also
 stepping
 up


when
 it
 comes
 to
 Ukraine,
 basically
 the


weapons
 from
 the
 US
 being
 delivered
 to


Ukraine,
 paid
 for
 by
 allies,
 and


Europeans
 coming
 together
 to
 discuss
 how


can
 we
 sustain
 Ukraine
 post
 the
 peace


deal.
 All
 of
 this
 is
 evidence
 of
 your


leadership
 of
 pushing
 the
 Europeans
 and


and
 the
 Canadians
 to
 do
 more
 to
 deliver


and
 to
 equalize
 in
 spending
 with
 the
 US.


So
 on
 all
 of
 this
 uh
 and
 today
 we
 will


talk
 more
 on
 how
 we
 can
 really
 bring


Ukraine
 to
 the
 next
 phase
 and
 get
 this


terrible
 war
 this
 and
 and
 all
 the


bloodshed
 ended.


>> And
 as
 you
 know
 we
 uh
 are
 going
 to
 be


making
 a
 big
 trip
 next
 week.
 Some
 of
 you


are
 going
 with
 us.
 We'll
 be
 going
 to


Malaysia,
 South
 Korea,
 and
 Japan.
 Uh
 in


uh
 South
 Korea,
 I'll
 be
 meeting
 with


President
 Xi
 of
 China.
 We'll
 have
 a


pretty
 long
 meeting
 scheduled.
 We
 can


work
 out
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 questions
 and
 our


doubts
 and
 our
 uh
 tremendous
 assets


together.
 So,
 we
 look
 forward
 to
 that.
 I


think
 something
 will
 work
 out.
 We
 have
 a


very
 good
 relationship.
 Uh
 but
 that'll


be
 a
 big
 one.
 We
 canled
 the
 meeting
 with


President
 Putin.
 It
 just
 it
 didn't
 feel


right
 to
 me.
 It
 didn't
 feel
 like
 we
 were


going
 to
 get
 to
 the
 place
 we
 have
 to


get,
 so
 I
 canled
 it,
 but
 we'll
 do
 it
 in


the
 future.
 But
 next
 week,
 we'll
 be
 with


many
 of
 you
 in
 those
 locations
 that
 I


told
 you.
 Then
 it's
 back
 back
 to


Washington.
 So,
 uh,
 thank
 you
 very
 much


everybody.
 Yeah,
 please.


>> Mr.
 President,
 can
 you
 tell
 us
 a
 little


bit
 about
 why
 you're
 elevating
 sanctions


against
 Russia
 right
 now?
 What's
 the


>> I
 just
 felt
 it
 was
 time.
 We've
 waited
 a


long
 time.
 I
 thought
 that
 we'd
 go
 long


before
 the
 Middle
 East.
 And
 Mark
 as
 you


know
 we
 did
 the
 Middle
 East
 plus
 seven.


So
 we
 did
 seven
 different
 wars
 from


>> from
 uh
 Pakistan
 and
 India
 to
 so
 many


>> which
 was
 which
 they
 said
 was
 impossible


to
 do.
 All
 these
 wars
 I
 did
 and
 the
 one


that
 uh
 we
 have
 left.
 We
 have
 one
 left.


It'll
 be
 nine.
 We
 have
 one
 left
 and
 I


think
 we'll
 get
 that
 done
 too.
 I
 think


we're
 on
 our
 way
 to
 getting
 it
 done.


>> We
 have
 to


Mr.
 President.
 Do
 you
 have
 a
 timeline


for
 when
 you
 think
 this
 war
 is
 going
 to


be
 over
 because
 of
 your
 leadership?


>> I
 don't
 have
 a
 timeline.
 You
 can't
 have


in
 war.
 It's
 hard
 to
 have
 a
 timeline.


You
 know,
 so
 many
 things
 happen
 in
 war.


Go
 ahead.


>> What
 about
 tomahawk
 missiles?
 Putin
 is


definitely


>> the
 problem
 with
 the
 tomahawk
 that
 a
 lot


of
 people
 don't
 know.
 It'll
 take
 a


minimum
 of
 six
 months,
 usually
 a
 year
 to


learn
 how
 to
 use
 them.
 They're
 highly


complex.
 So,
 the
 only
 way
 a
 tomahawk
 is


going
 to
 be
 shot
 is
 if
 we
 shot
 it.
 And


we're
 not
 going
 to
 do
 that.
 But
 uh
 there


is
 a
 tremendous
 learning
 curve
 with
 the


Tomok.
 It's
 a
 it's
 a
 very
 powerful


weapon,
 very
 accurate
 weapon.
 And
 maybe


that's
 what
 makes
 it
 so
 complex.
 But
 it


will
 take
 a
 year.
 It
 takes
 a
 year
 of


intense
 training
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 use
 it.


And
 we
 know
 how
 to
 use
 it
 and
 we're
 not


going
 to
 be
 teaching
 other
 people.
 It


will
 be
 it's
 too
 far
 out
 into
 the


future.


Mr.
 President,
 I
 Mr.
 President,
 that
 you


said
 as
 recently
 as
 yesterday
 that
 you


still
 believe
 that
 Putin
 wants
 to
 end


the
 war.
 today
 you
 took
 this
 step
 to


rush
 the
 sanctions
 and
 put
 more
 pressure


on
 him.


>> What
 else
 are
 you
 going
 to
 do
 to


encourage
 him
 to
 get
 there
 or
 can
 you


explain
 why
 you
 do
 believe
 that
 he
 wants


peace?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 good
 question.
 Today
 is
 a


very
 big
 day
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 what
 we're


doing.
 Look,
 these
 are
 tremendous


sanctions.
 These
 are
 very
 big.
 Those
 are


against
 their
 two
 big
 oil
 companies
 and


we
 hope
 that
 they
 won't
 be
 on
 for
 long.


We
 hope
 that
 uh
 the
 war
 will
 be
 settled.


uh
 we
 just
 answered
 uh
 having
 to
 do
 with


the
 various
 forms
 of
 missiles
 and


everything
 else
 that
 we're
 looking
 at,


but
 we
 don't
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 be


necessary.
 Uh
 we
 would
 like
 to
 see
 them


just
 take
 the
 line
 that
 has
 been
 formed


over
 quite
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time
 and
 go


and
 let's,
 you
 know,
 go
 home.
 Uh
 last


week
 they
 had
 almost
 8,000


soldiers
 killed.
 Many
 Russians
 were


killed
 last
 week.
 Many
 Ukrainians
 were


killed
 last
 week.
 We
 think
 it's


ridiculous
 and
 we'd
 like
 to
 have
 it
 in.


>> Why
 do
 you
 think
 he
 wants
 to
 be
 so


>> uh
 let's
 bring
 on
 a
 guest
 to
 get
 some
 of


his
 analysis
 on
 what
 has
 gone
 on
 with


Tesla.
 Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,


Steve,
 what's
 up?


>> What's
 going
 on?


>> Well,
 Tesla's
 going
 on,
 but
 it's
 not


really
 going
 up
 or
 down.


And


>> yeah,
 I'm
 a
 little
 surprised
 it's
 not


down
 more
 to
 be
 honest
 with
 you.


>> Did
 you
 think
 it
 was
 that
 bad
 of
 a


quarter?


>> Yes.


Now
 look,
 I
 didn't
 read
 through
 the


note.
 I
 just
 glanced
 at
 the
 numbers,
 but


yes,
 this
 is
 not
 good
 for
 Tesla.


>> Okay,
 so
 give
 me
 your
 raw
 thoughts.
 EPS


miss
 revenue
 in
 line.
 What
 do
 you
 think?


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 look,
 this
 is
 completely


raw
 thoughts
 and
 I
 may
 change
 my
 mind


later,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 I'm
 going
 to


because
 this
 is
 the
 best
 the
 auto


margins
 are
 likely
 to
 be
 for
 quite
 some


time
 considering
 that
 you
 have
 the


regulatory
 credits
 becoming
 extinct
 in


Q4.
 So,
 they
 could
 have
 pulled
 a
 lot
 of


stuff
 forward.
 We
 that
 remains
 to
 be


seen.
 I
 don't
 think
 they're
 going to


have
 as
 strong
 as
 a
 holiday
 season
 as


they
 would
 have
 in
 the
 past.
 Um,
 the


energy
 is
 very
 interesting.
 I
 actually


think
 the
 energy
 numbers
 were
 really


good
 on
 the
 top
 line
 because


as
 X
 AI
 and
 other
 companies
 build
 out


more
 data
 centers,
 they're
 likely
 to
 get


more
 battery
 packs,
 that
 type
 of
 thing.


I
 don't
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 big


bump
 in
 residential
 solar
 and
 power


walls
 just
 because
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be


as
 advantageous
 for
 people
 to
 spend
 30,


40,
 50
 grand
 to
 put
 those
 systems
 in.


Um,
 the
 big
 thing
 that
 I'm
 looking
 at


right
 now
 is
 their
 gross
 margin
 and


operating
 margin
 going
 down.
 And
 I
 don't


see
 how
 they
 can
 get
 that
 back
 up
 with


credits
 going
 away.
 they're
 going
 to


need
 to
 do
 something
 else.
 Robots
 can't


come
 fast
 enough.
 This
 earnings
 call
 is


so
 important.
 If
 they
 botch
 this


earnings
 call,
 this
 is
 going
 under
 400.


If
 they
 have
 a
 good
 if
 they
 have
 a
 great


earnings
 call,
 this
 could
 go
 to
 475.


This
 is
 a
 makeorb
 breakak
 moment
 for


when
 they're
 actually
 going
 to
 start


generating
 real
 revenue
 from
 not
 just


optimist
 but
 actually
 doing
 something


with
 robo
 taxes
 and
 actually
 explaining


what
 the
 hell
 they're
 going
 to
 do
 with


it
 because


this
 is
 on
 the
 surface
 not
 there's
 a


reason
 why
 this
 is
 not
 going
 parabolic


right
 now
 and
 when
 I
 do
 the
 number
 like


I'm
 putting
 Tesla
 into
 my
 model
 right


Now,
 I
 mean,
 $6.83
 billion
 in
 free
 cash


flow
 over
 the
 TTM.
 Even
 if
 you


extrapolate
 out,
 even
 if
 I
 was
 to
 say,


okay,
 they
 did
 four
 billion
 this


quarter.
 Let's
 just
 say
 they
 match
 that


in
 the
 next
 four
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 do


16
 billion
 going
 forward,
 they're
 still


a
 $1.4
 trillion
 company.
 That's
 not
 a


lot
 of
 free
 cash
 flow
 for
 a
 market
 cap


of
 that
 size.
 So,
 I
 just
 I
 don't
 know.


Do
 you
 think


>> I'm
 not
 thrilled.


>> Is
 there
 anything
 positive
 you
 saw
 or


are
 the
 numbers
 just
 so
 egregious
 that


you
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 make
 sense
 of
 it?


>> I
 need
 to
 read
 through
 the
 entire


report.
 Like
 I
 said,
 I
 just
 glanced


through
 the
 numbers,
 but
 the
 numbers


that
 I'm
 seeing
 do
 not
 justify
 this


market
 cap


>> and
 I'm
 a
 Tesla
 shareholder.


>> Well,
 you're
 not
 you
 don't


I
 like


>> Hold
 on.
 I
 am
 backed
 I
 like
 how
 you're


hedging
 your
 bets
 here,
 but
 you're
 not.


>> I
 am
 backed
 to
 being
 a
 Tesla
 shareholder


through
 proxy.


>> Your
 wife
 owning
 one
 share
 doesn't
 mean


you're
 a
 Tesla.


>> But
 I
 am
 still
 a
 Tesla
 shareholder.


>> I
 was
 wondering
 if
 this
 is
 how
 mean


Steve
 is
 to
 a
 company
 he
 owns.
 I
 can't


imagine
 the
 company
 he
 doesn't
 own.
 But


now
 I
 got
 the
 the
 the
 proxy
 there.
 Well,


>> look,
 I
 love
 that
 the
 free
 cash
 flow
 is


up
 46%.


I
 don't
 like
 that
 the
 adjusted
 IBID
 is


down
 9%.
 Yeah.
 In
 a
 quarter
 where


>> you're
 not
 getting
 regulatory
 credits


back.
 Like
 we
 know
 that's
 not
 happening.


>> And
 I
 don't
 like
 the
 margins
 are
 going


down.
 Like


do
 we
 think
 margins
 are
 going
 to
 get


better
 where
 they're
 going
 to
 get
 back


to
 an
 11
 or
 12%
 operating
 margin
 in
 the


next
 couple
 of
 quarters
 when
 you're
 at


5.8?
 I
 don't
 think
 so.


>> Okay.
 So,
 do
 do
 you
 think
 Elon
 says


anything
 on
 the
 call
 that
 gets
 the
 stock


to
 react
 in
 a
 positive
 way?


>> Absolutely.
 He's
 got
 to
 say,
 "Listen,


big
 surprise.


Optimus
 is
 coming
 in
 2026
 and
 we
 expect


to
 sell
 250,000
 units
 and
 then
 2027
 we


sell
 a
 million
 units
 and
 there's
 such
 a


huge
 backlog
 from
 companies
 this
 won't


even
 be
 available
 to
 the
 public
 till


2030."
 I
 think
 if
 he
 says
 that
 this
 goes


over
 500,


>> dude.
 But
 the
 funny
 thing
 is
 he
 can
 say


it
 and
 like
 who
 cares?
 Like
 if
 it


doesn't
 happen,
 it's
 Elon,
 right?
 It's


like
 no
 one's
 gonna
 whatever.


>> So
 he
 theoretically
 could
 say
 it.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 want
 to
 share
 my
 screen.
 So


just
 give
 me
 one
 second.
 So
 let
 me
 put


one
 more
 number
 in
 this
 and
 I
 just
 want


to
 show
 you
 how
 insane
 this
 is.


>> No,
 but
 but
 like
 legit,
 right,
 guys?
 He


can
 say
 anything
 and
 then
 if
 it
 doesn't


happen,
 people
 like,
 "Oh,
 that's
 Elon.


his
 ambitious
 timelines,
 but
 like
 he
 can


still
 say
 it.
 He
 can
 get
 away
 with
 it.


He's
 done
 it
 for
 freaking
 15
 years
 now.


Tesla
 Semi
 is
 not
 really
 here
 yet.


>> Correct.
 So


>> yeah,
 he
 doesn't
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 the


consequences,


but
 he
 can
 pump
 the
 stock.


>> Yeah.
 He
 can
 say
 whatever
 he
 wants
 right


now
 because
 if
 they
 don't
 miss
 it,
 it's


just
 another
 Elon
 promise
 that
 he
 falls


short
 on.
 He
 almost
 has
 to
 say.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 and
 then
 people
 will
 say,


well,
 you
 know,
 he's
 ambitious.
 He's


trying.
 saying
 he's
 going
 to
 change
 the


world.
 You
 have
 to
 be
 ambitious.
 You


know,
 like
 excuse
 what
 what
 type
 of


flavor
 of
 milk
 is
 that?
 Is
 that
 regular


milk?


>> It's
 not
 milk,
 sir.
 Don't
 disrespect
 the


whole
 milk.


>> That's
 y
 That's
 whole
 milk.


>> No,
 I
 said
 don't
 disrespect
 the
 whole


milk.
 This
 is
 peach
 yogurt.
 All
 right.


>> All right.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 milk
 the


whole
 time.


>> Not
 milk.


>> Not


I'm
 both.
 I
 love
 whole
 milk
 and
 yogurt.


But


keep
 in
 mind,
 this
 is
 not
 Tesla's
 free


cash
 flow.
 This
 is
 me
 saying,
 "Okay,


they
 did
 3.9.
 Let's
 just
 say
 that
 they


happen
 to
 do
 that
 over
 the
 next
 three


quarters."
 They're
 still
 at
 86
 times


free
 cash
 flow
 when
 freaking
 App
 Loving


is
 at
 66
 and
 a
 half.
 Into
 it
 is
 at
 30.


Freaking
 Netflix
 is
 still
 at
 55.
 It's


just
 I
 don't
 know.


it
 their
 real
 number
 is
 co
 let's
 give


them
 a
 benefit
 of
 the
 doubt
 it's
 called


seven
 right
 almost
 200
 times
 free
 cash


flow
 right
 now
 on
 trailing
 12


>> but
 they
 can
 get
 back
 to
 growth
 they'll


be
 growing
 faster
 than
 all
 those


companies


>> but
 they're
 not
 even
 spending
 a


tremendous
 Here's
 the
 problem
 you
 can


look
 at
 these
 numbers
 like
 okay
 Meta
 is


at
 37
 times
 Apple's
 at
 40
 times


Alphabet's
 at
 45
 times
 the
 difference


with
 the
 hyperscalers


They're
 generating
 over
 a
 hundred


billion
 in
 cash
 from
 operations
 and
 we


all
 know
 that
 they're
 building
 out
 data


centers.
 If
 they
 decide,
 you
 know
 what,


we're
 good
 on
 data
 centers,
 their
 free


cash
 flow
 is
 going
 to
 go
 up
 by
 40


billion
 overnight.


>> Right.
 Right.


>> So


for
 Tesla
 to
 be
 a
 $ 1.4
 trillion
 company


right
 now,
 generating
 7
 billion
 in
 free


cash
 flow,
 there
 is
 so
 much
 growth
 that


is
 pulled
 forward
 right
 now.
 He
 has
 to


come
 out
 guns
 blazing
 on
 robots
 and
 FSD


in
 order
 for
 this
 to
 stay
 here.
 Like


there's
 nowhere
 that
 this
 is
 this
 is
 not


going
 to
 this
 mar
 this
 market
 cap
 is
 not


expanding
 without
 that
 catalyst.


Um
 I'm
 putting
 in
 the
 chat
 right
 here.


So,
 by
 the
 way,
 72%
 of
 you
 said
 yes


Tesla
 should
 invest
 in
 XAI.
 Um,


do
 you
 think
 Elon
 will
 pump
 the
 stock


with
 something
 during
 the
 call?
 Yes
 or


no?


I
 There's
 a
 world
 where
 Elon
 joins
 the


call
 and
 he's
 bored,
 he's
 tired,
 he's


lethargic,
 he's
 like
 not
 energetic.
 I


mean,
 that
 that
 is
 a
 very
 real


possibility
 like
 we
 got
 for
 the
 past


couple


or
 he
 might
 be
 super
 excited.


But
 Oh,
 yeah.
 Well,
 this
 is
 the
 Yeah,


hold
 on.
 That
 is
 That
 is
 true.
 This
 is


This
 is
 his
 pay
 package
 call,
 right?


This
 is
 This
 is
 the
 call
 right
 before
 he


asks
 everyone
 to
 vote
 for
 him.
 Tesla's


literally
 spending
 money
 to
 advertise
 to


get
 people
 to
 vote
 their
 shares.


>> He's
 going
 to
 come
 out
 guns
 blazing.
 So,


everybody
 thinks
 that,
 man,
 they're


going
 to
 do
 some
 awesome
 things
 over
 the


next
 couple
 years.


He
 doesn't
 have
 a
 He
 can't
 not
 do
 that.


>> He
 kind
 of
 can't
 have
 a
 bad
 call
 here.


Like,
 now
 granted,
 he's
 he's
 definitely


going
 to
 get
 his
 comp
 package
 approved.


In
 my
 opinion,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


overwhelming,
 but
 still,
 you
 want
 to


solidify
 it.


>> Yes.


>> To
 do
 that,
 you
 need
 a
 good
 call.


>> I
 just
 don't
 think
 the
 auto
 business
 is


interesting
 at
 this
 point.


The
 EV
 craze
 is
 not
 around
 anymore.
 I


mean,
 look,
 this
 isn't
 2021,
 2022
 where


people
 are
 going
 ugoo
 gaga
 over
 EVs.


It's
 just
 not


>> Yeah.
 No
 one
 cares.


>> Nobody
 cares
 about
 EVs
 anymore.
 Do
 you


hear


>> Do
 you
 hear
 people
 talking
 about
 EVs


anymore?
 No.


>> Nope.


>> Not
 at
 all.


>> So,
 it's
 energy
 and
 it's
 the
 future.
 And


I
 gotta
 tell
 you,
 I've
 been
 saying
 this


a
 long
 time.
 I
 do
 not
 think
 that
 they're


going
 to
 generate
 the
 type
 of
 revenue


people
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 generate


from
 FSD.
 I
 think
 people
 are
 discounting


Uber
 so
 much
 they
 need
 to
 play
 up


Optimus
 and
 they
 need
 to
 get
 Optimist
 to


the
 forefront
 ASAP.


Is
 that
 something?
 If
 they
 generate
 five


million
 bots
 a
 year,
 they're
 selling


five
 million
 bots
 a
 year.
 They
 do
 10


million
 bots
 a
 year,
 they're
 selling
 10


million
 bots
 a
 year.


Jose,
 do
 you
 do
 you
 drive
 a
 Tesla
 or
 or


no?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 FS.
 Well,
 FSD
 pretty
 much


everywhere.
 But


>> how
 long
 have
 you
 had
 your
 Tesla?


>> Um,
 I
 got
 it
 April
 of
 last
 year.


>> Auto.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 So,
 why
 why
 did
 you
 why
 did
 you


buy
 a
 Tesla?


>> Um,


why
 did
 I
 I


>> like
 did
 you
 care
 about
 the
 environment


or
 something
 or


>> No.
 No.
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 a
 great
 pricing


compared
 to
 everything.
 Oh,
 I
 remember.


I
 had
 just
 had
 my
 little
 one
 um
 and
 I


needed
 a
 family
 car
 and
 uh
 most
 of
 my


cars
 were
 manual
 and
 pretty
 small.
 So
 I


needed
 something
 that
 can
 fit
 the
 family


and
 also
 be
 somewhat
 fast.
 Uh
 so
 I


enjoyed
 the
 little
 bit
 of
 performance


aspects
 that
 came
 with
 it,
 the


technology
 aspect
 we
 behind
 it.
 So
 um


those
 two
 were
 the
 biggest


driving
 force
 for
 me.
 And
 at
 the
 time


you
 had
 the
 great
 um
 easy
 to
 buy
 and
 uh


the
 great
 incentives.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 I
 bought
 it
 because
 of
 FSD


at
 0%
 APR
 and
 I
 was
 upgrading
 from
 a


Honda
 Civic,
 but
 it
 wasn't
 like
 oh
 my


goodness,
 I
 want
 to
 save
 the
 environment


and
 like
 it's
 it
 like
 I
 feel
 like
 2021


2019
 that
 was
 the
 argument
 around
 EVs


and
 that
 was
 Elon
 used
 to
 talk
 about


sustainable
 energy.
 Like
 he
 doesn't
 talk


about
 that
 stuff
 anymore,
 you
 know?
 So,


I
 don't
 think
 that's
 the
 framing
 either


on
 EVs
 in
 general.


>> I
 would
 say
 this
 was
 probably
 one
 of
 the


first
 cars
 that
 I
 didn't
 have
 like


buyer's
 remorse
 where
 it's
 like
 I
 I


literally
 I
 felt
 like
 I
 paid
 great
 value


for
 for
 the
 vehicle


>> that
 I
 100%
 agree
 with.
 I
 think
 I
 got
 a


great
 value
 for
 the
 vehicle
 and
 I
 like


FSD,
 but
 you
 know,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


people
 that
 just
 don't
 even
 know
 the


concept
 of
 FSD
 and
 Tesla's
 not


necessarily


easily
 getting
 them
 into
 their
 ecosystem


just
 because
 some
 of
 these
 models
 are


still
 priced
 a
 bit
 higher.


Um,
 the
 call
 should
 be
 starting


in
 about
 30
 seconds.
 They
 have
 the


stream
 up


and
 yeah,
 guys,
 so
 we'll
 be
 listening
 to


it.
 Again,
 fair
 warning,
 I
 think
 it
 is


going
 to
 be
 pretty
 boring.
 You're
 going


to
 get
 some
 quotes
 here
 or
 there.
 The


CFO
 is
 going
 to
 talk
 for
 like
 30
 minutes


off
 a
 PowerPoint.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 like


you
 could
 literally
 go
 somewhere
 else


and
 come
 back
 until
 Elon
 speaks.
 Elon


will
 give
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 the
 opening


remarks
 and
 then
 once
 you
 get
 to
 Q&A,


you
 might
 actually
 get
 some
 real


substance
 of
 how
 they're
 thinking
 about


the
 business,
 but
 first
 30
 to
 40
 minutes


might
 not
 be
 the
 most
 exciting
 and
 then


we're
 going
 to
 see
 from
 there.


Um


poll
 in
 the
 chat,
 68%
 of
 you
 say
 yes,


Elon
 will
 pump
 the
 stock
 by
 saying


something.


Stock
 right
 now
 is
 432,
 down
 1.5%.
 So


432
 is
 what
 we're
 working
 with


in
 terms
 of
 potentially
 seeing


a
 move
 higher.


Crypto
 still
 moving
 down
 after
 hours


based
 on
 those
 Trump
 sanctions
 as
 well.


So,
 that's
 still
 a
 little
 red.
 Oil


prices
 still
 a
 bit
 up.


All
 right.
 Should
 be
 starting
 in
 about


20
 seconds.


>> Have
 you
 tried
 the
 new
 FSD?
 Um,
 did
 you


get
 the
 upgrade
 yet
 or
 No,


>> I
 14.1.


>> No,
 I
 don't
 have
 that
 one
 yet.


>> No.
 Oh,


>> that
 you
 do.
 You
 have
 it?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But,
 uh,
 my
 wife's
 the
 one


that
 commutes
 mainly
 to
 work.
 She
 does


like
 an
 hour
 drive
 each
 way
 and
 she
 uses


it
 all
 the
 time.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 if


she's
 tried
 the
 uh
 if
 she's
 noticed


anything
 different,
 I'll
 talk
 to
 her.


>> Yeah,
 I
 just
 needed
 it
 to
 stop
 nagging


every
 time
 I
 check
 my
 phone
 and
 it's


like
 getting
 a
 lot
 better
 at
 that.


Again,
 here
 are
 the
 topline
 numbers.
 50


cents
 versus
 55
 cents
 expected
 on
 EPS.


Revenue
 28.6
 versus
 26.7.


So,
 there
 was
 a
 beat
 on
 EPS
 or
 a
 miss
 on


EPS
 and
 a
 beat
 on
 revenues.


Um,


uh,
 one
 thing
 I
 feel
 like
 not
 many


people
 are
 talking
 about,
 we're
 talking


a
 lot
 about
 FSD,
 the
 energy,
 um,
 and


Optimus,
 but,
 um,
 it
 feels
 like
 the
 robo


taxi
 phase
 kind
 of
 or
 or
 like
 this
 craze


about
 it
 is
 kind
 of
 dying
 off.
 Do
 you


think
 we
 hear
 anything
 about
 that


expansion?
 I
 know
 we
 saw
 it
 in
 in
 Austin


is
 doing
 really
 good
 and
 I
 think
 it


moves
 somewhere
 else
 as
 well.
 I
 think


California,


do
 you
 think
 we
 hear
 any
 more
 about


that?
 I
 think
 we
 kind
 of
 have
 to,
 right?


I
 think
 we
 kind
 of
 have
 to.
 Yeah,
 I
 I I


hope
 we
 do.
 I
 mean,
 Texas
 and
 Nevada
 is


not
 enough.
 Like,
 there
 has
 to
 be
 a
 real


plan
 for
 meaningful
 expansion.
 So,
 I


would
 imagine
 we
 do
 hear
 something.
 Uh,


the
 call
 is
 still
 not
 starting
 yet,


guys.
 We
 are
 still
 waiting.


They
 are
 couple
 minutes
 late,


so
 we
 are
 still
 waiting.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 do


think
 robo
 taxi
 should
 be
 something
 of


an
 expansion.
 Uh
 we'll
 go
 back
 to
 Trump


and
 as
 soon
 as
 Elon's
 live
 then
 uh
 then


we'll
 we'll
 go
 to
 Elon.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Um
 the
 president
 of


Columbia
 in
 a
 recent
 interview
 said
 that


if
 you
 won't
 change
 he
 thinks
 that


people
 should
 get
 rid


>> we're
 talking
 about
 now
 Colombia
 the


country
 not
 the
 university.
 Go
 ahead.
 He


said
 what?


>> He
 said
 that
 if
 you
 won't
 change
 then


perhaps
 you
 need
 to
 be
 gotten
 rid
 of.
 Do


you


>> Well,
 he's
 a
 thug
 and
 bad
 guy.
 He's
 a


guy
 that
 is
 making
 a
 lot
 of
 drugs.
 We've


just
 as
 of
 today
 stopped
 all
 payments


going
 to
 Colombia,
 the
 country
 Colombia


also
 the
 school
 Colombia.
 No,
 we


settled.
 We
 made
 a
 settlement
 with
 him.


But
 uh
 no,
 he's
 a
 thug
 and
 he's
 a
 bad


guy
 and
 he's
 hurt
 his
 country
 very


badly.
 They're
 doing
 it
 very
 poorly.


Colombia,
 they
 make
 cocaine.
 They
 have


cocaine
 factories.
 They
 grow
 all
 sorts


of
 crap.
 That's
 drugs,
 bad
 drugs
 coming


into
 the
 United
 States.
 goes
 generally


through
 Mexico
 and
 he
 better
 watch
 it
 or


we'll
 take
 very
 serious
 action
 against


him
 and
 his
 country.
 His
 country
 is
 what


what
 he
 has
 led
 his
 country
 into
 is
 a


death
 trap.


>> Please
 um
 has
 the
 secretary
 general


presented
 his
 Ukraine
 peace
 plan
 to
 you?


Are
 you
 prepared
 to
 be
 chairman
 of
 the


board
 of
 peace?


>> Oh,
 there
 is
 no
 secretary
 general
 peace


plan.
 But
 I'm
 here
 for
 No,
 no,
 really.
 I


really
 want
 to
 correct
 it
 because
 I
 saw


some
 of
 that
 in
 the
 media.
 Of
 course,


many
 people
 are
 thinking
 how
 to
 bring


this
 terrible
 war
 to
 an
 end
 and


supporting
 the
 president
 in
 doing
 that.


Why
 I'm
 here
 is
 to
 dialogue
 again
 with


the
 president
 how
 I
 can
 be,
 how
 NATO,
 my


colleagues
 and
 other
 colleagues
 in
 NATO


can
 be
 of
 maximum
 support
 to
 get
 that


done.
 And
 but
 there
 is
 no
 peace
 plan
 on


the
 table.
 I
 mean,
 if
 there
 is
 a
 peace


plan,
 it
 is
 what
 the
 president
 said
 last


Friday
 and
 Sunday,
 which
 is
 stop
 where


you
 are,
 stop
 the
 fighting.
 This
 is


about
 NATO.
 We're
 a
 very
 proud
 member
 of


NATO.
 We
 have
 a
 great
 relationship
 with


the
 countries
 of
 NATO.
 I
 think
 made
 much


better
 by
 our
 visit
 a
 few
 months
 ago


when
 they
 agreed
 to
 they
 agreed
 to
 5%


instead
 of
 2%
 of
 GDP.
 That
 was
 a
 big


concession.
 I
 think
 that
 was
 a


concession
 that
 two
 years
 ago
 nobody


would
 have
 said
 even
 a
 year
 ago,


>> even
 nine
 months
 ago
 before
 you
 were


elected.


>> Yeah.
 They
 would
 have
 said
 that's
 not


possible.
 And
 the
 difference
 is
 they're


paying
 5%
 as
 opposed
 to
 not
 paying
 2%.


They
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 weren't
 pay
 with


the
 exception
 of
 Spain.
 I
 think
 you're


gonna
 have
 to
 talk
 to
 Spain
 because


they're
 not
 Spain
 is
 not
 a
 team
 player.


So
 other
 than
 other
 than
 Spain,


everybody's
 100%


and
 you
 could
 solve
 the
 Spain
 problem


very
 easily,
 I
 think.
 You
 know,
 if
 you


want


Brian,
 go
 ahead.


>> Yeah,
 go
 ahead.
 Then
 we'll
 take
 Brian.


Go
 ahead.


>> The
 soybean
 farmers,
 are
 they
 going
 to


be
 getting
 support
 from
 you
 soon?
 And


your


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 they
 do.
 So
 what's
 happened


you
 could
 say
 with
 that
 you
 could
 say


with
 beef
 with
 with
 all
 of
 it
 uh
 the


beef
 uh
 the
 ranchers
 let's
 say
 uh
 who


have
 done
 a
 great
 job
 have
 lost
 their


shirts
 for
 many
 many
 years
 they've


really
 been
 decimated
 and
 I
 help
 them
 a


lot
 I
 put
 tariffs
 on
 things
 coming
 in


>> all
 right

forward-looking
 statements.
 These


comments
 are
 based
 on
 our
 predictions


and
 expectations
 as

 Before
 we
 jump
 into


Q&A,
 Elon
 has
 some
 opening
 remarks.


Elon,


thank
 you.
 We're


we're
 at
 a
 critical
 inflection
 point
 for


Tesla
 and
 our
 strategy
 going
 forward
 as


we
 bring
 AI
 into
 the
 real
 world.
 Um
 I


think
 it's
 important
 to
 emphasize
 that


Tesla
 really
 is
 the
 leader
 in
 real
 world


AI.
 Uh
 no
 one
 can
 do
 what
 we
 can
 do
 with


real
 world
 AI.
 Um,
 I
 have
 pretty
 good


insight
 into
 AI
 in
 general.
 I
 think
 that


Tesla
 has
 the
 highest
 intelligence


density
 of
 any
 AI
 out
 there
 in
 the
 car.


Um,
 and
 that
 is
 only
 going
 to
 get


better.


Um,
 and
 we're
 really
 just
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 scaling
 at
 a
 at
 a
 quite


massively
 full
 self-driving
 and
 robo


taxi
 and
 fundamentally
 changing
 the


nature
 of
 transport.
 I
 think
 people
 just


don't
 don't
 quite
 appreciate
 the
 degree


to
 which
 this
 will
 uh
 take
 off.
 um


where
 that
 that
 it's
 honestly
 it's
 going


to
 be
 like
 a
 shock
 wave.
 Um
 so


it's
 it's
 a


you
 cuz
 the
 cars
 are
 all
 out
 there.


there.
 You
 know,
 we
 have
 millions
 of


cars
 out
 there
 that
 with
 a
 software


update
 become


um
 full
 self-driving
 cars
 and
 um
 and
 you


know,
 we're
 making
 a
 couple
 million
 a


year
 um
 and
 and and
 in
 fact
 with
 the


advent
 of
 with
 with
 what
 we
 see
 now
 as


as
 a
 clarity
 on


achieving
 full
 self-driving,


unsupervised
 full
 self-driving
 I
 should


say,
 um
 I
 feel
 confident
 in
 expanding


Tesla's
 production.
 Um,
 so
 that
 is
 that


is
 our
 intent
 to
 expand
 as
 quickly
 as
 we


can
 our
 future
 production.


Um,
 so
 I
 was
 I
 was
 reticent
 to
 do
 that


until
 we
 had
 clarity
 on
 on
 uh
 achieving


uh
 unsupervised
 full
 self-driving.
 But


at
 this
 point
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 we've
 got


clarity
 and
 it
 it
 makes
 sense
 to


um
 expand
 production
 as
 as
 fast
 as
 we


reasonably
 can.


uh
 we're
 also
 making
 huge
 uh
 um


make
 making
 huge
 impact
 on
 the
 energy


sector
 with
 uh
 with
 battery
 storage.
 So


with
 both
 the
 power
 wall
 um
 and


especially
 with
 the
 mega
 pack
 uh
 we
 are


dramatically
 improving
 the
 ability
 to
 um


generate
 more
 energy
 from
 the
 grid.
 Let


me
 sort
 of
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 that


which
 is
 if
 if
 you
 look
 at
 total
 US


energy
 um
 capability
 for
 example
 there's


roughly
 a
 terowatt
 of
 of
 continuous


power
 available
 in
 the
 US
 but
 the


average
 usage
 over
 a
 24-hour
 cycle
 is


only
 half
 a
 terowatt
 because
 of
 the
 big


difference
 between
 day
 and
 night
 usage.


um
 if
 you
 buffer
 that
 buffer
 the
 energy


with
 batteries,
 you
 can
 effectively


double
 the
 energy
 output
 in
 the
 United


States
 just
 with
 batteries
 building
 no


incremental
 power
 plants.
 Um
 and
 it's


very
 difficult
 to
 build
 power
 plants.
 So


they
 take
 a
 long
 time.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


permitting
 and
 it's
 not
 an
 industry


that's
 used
 to
 moving
 fast.
 So


we
 see
 the
 potential
 there
 for
 Tesla


battery
 packs
 uh
 to
 greatly
 improve
 the


um
 the
 energy
 output
 per
 year
 for
 any


given
 grid
 US
 or
 otherwise.


Um,
 we're
 also
 on
 the
 cusp
 of
 of


something
 really
 tremendous
 with


Optimus,
 um,
 which
 I
 think


uh,
 is
 likely
 to
 be
 or
 has
 potential
 to


be
 the
 biggest
 product
 of
 all
 time.
 Um,


and,
 uh,


it's
 it's
 a
 a
 difficult
 project.
 Um,
 and


it's
 worth
 noting
 that
 it's
 not
 like


it's
 it's
 just
 automatic.
 Um
 I'm
 unaware


of
 any
 robot
 program
 by
 uh
 Ford
 or
 GM
 or


you
 know
 any
 by
 US
 sort
 of
 car


companies.
 People
 like
 I
 think
 maybe


think
 of
 Tesla
 as
 as
 a
 car
 company.
 We


mostly
 make
 cars
 um
 and
 battery
 packs.


Uh
 but
 uh


so
 it's
 not
 like
 it's
 not
 just
 like
 an


obvious
 fall
 off
 a
 log
 thing
 to
 make


Optimus
 but
 but
 we
 do
 have
 the


ingredients
 um
 with
 of
 real
 world
 AI


um
 and
 exceptional
 electrical
 mechanical


engineering
 capabilities


um
 and
 the
 ability
 to
 scale
 production


which
 I
 don't
 think
 anyone
 else
 has
 all


of
 those
 ingredients.


Um


so


uh
 yeah
 with


with
 with
 version
 14
 of
 the
 uh
 of


self-driving
 which
 people
 you
 can
 see


the
 reactions
 of
 of
 people
 online
 um


they're
 quite
 amazed.
 Um
 actually
 anyone


in
 the
 US
 can
 get
 uh
 version
 14
 if
 they


just
 uh
 go
 and
 select
 uh
 I
 want
 the


advanced
 software
 in
 their
 car.
 So,
 if


if
 you're
 listening
 right
 now
 and
 you'd


like
 to
 try
 it
 out,
 just
 uh
 go
 in
 um
 in


settings
 and
 say
 I
 want
 the
 advanced


software
 and
 you
 will
 get
 version
 14.
 Um


and
 uh
 yeah,
 so


uh
 on
 the
 Mega
 front,
 we
 we
 we
 unveiled


Mega
 Blok,
 Mega
 3.
 Um
 we
 also
 have


exciting
 plans
 for
 Mega
 Pac
 4.
 uh
 Mega


Pac
 4
 will
 incorporate
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 the


um


uh
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 is
 normally
 in
 a


substation
 uh
 and
 be
 able
 to
 output
 uh


at
 uh


probably
 35
 kilovolts
 uh
 directly.
 So


this
 this
 greatly
 improves
 our
 ability


to
 deploy
 Megapac
 because
 it's
 not


dependent
 on
 building
 uh
 a
 substation
 up


through
 35
 KV
 for
 mega
 pack
 4.
 So
 that


that'll
 be
 next


that's
 the
 that's
 the
 engineering


priority
 for
 um
 MegaPAC.
 Um


and
 uh
 we
 look
 forward
 to
 unveiling


Optimus
 V3


um
 you
 know
 probably
 in
 Q1.
 I
 think


it'll
 be
 ready
 for
 uh
 to
 show
 off
 and
 uh


that
 that
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to
 be
 quite


remarkable.
 Um,


if
 you
 It
 won't
 even
 seem
 like
 a
 robot.


It'll
 seem
 like
 a
 person
 in
 a
 robot


suit,
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 how
 we
 started


off
 with
 Optimus.


Um,
 but
 it
 it'll
 seem
 so
 real
 that


you'll
 need
 to
 like
 poke
 it,
 I
 think,
 to


believe
 that
 it's
 actually
 a
 robot.


Um,


and
 and
 obviously
 like
 the
 the
 the
 real


world
 intelligence
 we're
 de
 we've


developed
 for
 the
 car.
 um
 most
 of
 that


transfers
 to
 Optimus.
 So,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


very
 good
 starting
 point.


Um
 in
 conclusion,
 uh
 we're
 excited
 about


the
 you
 know
 updated
 mission
 of
 Tesla


which
 is
 sustainable
 abundance.
 Um
 so


going
 beyond
 sustainable
 energy
 to
 say


sustainable
 abundance
 is
 the
 mission


where
 uh
 we
 we
 believe
 with


uh
 with
 Optimus
 and
 self-driving


um


that
 uh
 you
 can
 actually
 create
 a
 world


where
 there
 is
 no
 poverty
 uh
 where


everyone
 has
 access
 to
 the
 finest


medical
 care
 Um


like
 Optimus
 will
 be
 an
 incredible


surgeon
 for
 example.
 Um
 and
 imagine
 if


everyone
 had
 access
 to
 an
 incredible


surgeon.


Um


so
 so
 I
 I
 think
 there's


you
 know
 of
 course
 we
 need
 make
 sure


Optimus
 is
 safe
 and
 everything
 but
 but
 I


I
 do
 think
 we're
 headed
 for
 a
 world
 of


sustainable
 abundance
 and
 that
 I'm


excited
 to
 work
 with
 the
 Tesla
 team
 to


make
 that
 happen.


Great.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much,
 Elon.
 Uh,


Vebup
 also
 has
 some
 opening
 remarks.


>> Thanks,
 Travis.
 Q3
 was
 a
 special
 quarter


at
 multiple
 levels.
 We
 set
 new
 records


not
 just
 for
 deliveries
 and
 deployments,


but
 also
 around
 a
 range
 of
 financial


metrics
 from
 total
 revenues,
 energy


gross
 profit,
 energy
 margins
 to
 fresh


free
 cash
 flow.


This
 was
 the
 result
 of
 continued


confidence
 of
 our
 customers
 in
 our


products
 and
 the
 relentless
 efforts
 by


the
 Tesla
 team.
 The
 strength
 in


deliveries
 was
 attributed
 to
 strong


performance
 across
 all
 regions.
 Greater


China
 and
 APAC
 were
 up
 sequentially
 33


and
 29%
 respectively.
 North
 America
 was


up
 28%
 while
 AMIA
 was
 up
 25%.
 The
 pace


in
 deliveries
 was
 the
 function
 of


continued
 excitement
 around
 the
 new


Model
 Y.
 We
 had
 previously
 talked
 about


2025
 being
 the
 year
 of
 the
 Y
 and
 have


since
 delivered
 on
 that
 promise
 with
 the


new
 Model
 Y
 released
 in
 Q1
 followed
 by


Model
 Y
 long
 wheelbase
 and
 performance


and
 more
 recently
 Standard
 Y
 in
 North


America
 and
 AMIA.


We're
 now
 operating
 a
 robot
 taxi
 in
 two


markets,
 Austin
 and
 most
 Bay
 Area


cities.
 We've
 already
 expanded
 our


coverage
 area
 in
 Austin
 three
 times


since
 the
 initial
 launch
 and
 are
 on
 pace


to
 continue
 expanding
 further.
 Unlike


our
 competitors,
 our
 robot
 taxi
 fleet


blends
 in
 the
 markets
 we
 operate
 in


since
 they
 don't
 have
 extra
 sensor
 sets


or
 peripherals
 which
 make
 them
 stick


out.
 This
 is
 an
 underappreciated
 aspect


of
 our
 current
 vehicle
 offerings
 which


are
 all
 designed
 for
 autonomous
 driving.


We
 feel
 that
 as
 experience
 uh
 as
 people


experience
 the
 supervised
 FSD
 at
 scale,


the
 demand
 for
 our
 vehicles
 like
 Elon


said
 would
 increase
 significantly.


On
 the
 FSD
 adaption
 front,
 we
 we've


continued
 to
 see
 decent
 progress.


However,
 note
 that
 total
 paid
 FSD


customer
 base
 is
 still
 small,
 around
 12%


of
 our
 current
 fleet.
 We're
 moving
 we're


working
 with
 regulators
 in
 places
 like


China
 and
 AMIA
 to
 obtain
 approvals.
 so


that
 we
 can
 get
 FSD
 in
 those
 regions
 as


well.
 Now
 covering
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 the


financial
 side,
 automotive
 revenues


increased
 29%
 sequentially
 in
 line
 with


the
 growth
 in
 deliveries.


While
 regulatory
 credits
 declined


sequentially,
 we
 entered
 into
 new


contracts
 and
 continued
 delivery
 on


previously
 entered
 contracts.


Our
 automotive
 margins
 excluding
 credits


increased
 marginally
 from
 15%
 to
 15.4.


four,
 which
 was
 attributed
 to


improvements
 in
 material
 cost
 and
 better


fixed
 cost
 absorption
 due
 to
 higher


volumes.


The
 energy
 storage
 business
 continued
 to


deliver
 with
 record
 deployments,
 gross


profit
 and
 margins.
 As
 discussed
 before,


this
 business
 has
 a
 bigger
 impact
 from


tariffs
 as
 measured
 by
 percentage
 of


COGS
 since
 currently
 all
 sales
 procured


are
 from
 China
 while
 we're
 still
 working


on
 other
 alternatives.


However,
 as
 uh
 the
 ramp
 of
 mega
 factory


Shanghai
 is
 happening,
 this
 is
 helping


us
 avoid
 tariffs
 because
 we
 are
 using


this
 factory
 to
 supply
 the
 non-
 US


demand.


Like
 Elon
 said,
 you
 know,
 grids
 scale


storage.
 The
 only
 way
 we
 can
 get
 to


electricity
 fastest
 is
 by
 using
 storage.


The
 other
 thing
 to
 keep
 in
 mind
 is
 we


are
 seeing
 headwinds
 in
 this
 business


given
 the
 increase
 in
 competition
 and


tariffs.
 The
 total
 tariff
 impacts
 for
 Q3


for
 both
 businesses
 was
 in
 excess
 of
 400


million
 generally
 split
 evenly
 between


them.


Services
 and
 other
 demonstrated
 a
 marked


improvement
 sequentially.
 This
 was
 a


function
 of
 improvements
 primarily
 in


our
 insurance
 and
 service
 center


businesses.
 Note
 that
 while
 small,
 our


robo
 taxi
 costs
 are
 included
 within


services
 and
 other
 along
 with
 our
 other


businesses
 like
 paid
 supercharging,
 used


car,
 parts
 and
 merchandise
 sales
 etc.


Our
 operating
 expenses
 increase


sequentially.


The
 largest
 increase
 included
 in


restructuring
 and
 other
 related
 to


certain
 actions
 undertaken
 to
 reduce


cost
 and
 improve
 efficiency
 through


convergence
 of
 our
 AR
 AI
 chip
 design


efforts.
 Additionally,
 we
 incurred
 legal


expenses
 related
 to
 proceedings
 in


certain
 legal
 cases
 as
 well
 as


incremental
 cost
 incurred
 in
 preparation


for
 our
 shareholder
 meeting.
 Such
 costs


are
 recorded
 within
 SGNA.


Further,
 our
 employee
 related
 spend
 is


increasing
 especially
 in
 R&D
 as
 we
 have


recently
 granted
 various


performance-based
 equity
 awards
 to


employees
 working
 on
 AI
 initiatives
 and


therefore
 such
 spend
 will
 continue
 to


increase
 going
 forward.


on
 other
 income.
 Uh
 our
 other
 income


decreased
 sequentially
 primarily
 from


locktomarket
 adjustments
 on
 BTC
 holdings


which
 was
 much
 smaller
 gain
 of
 80


million
 in
 Q3
 versus
 284
 million
 in
 Q2


with
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 movement


attributable
 to
 FX
 movements
 in
 the


quarter.


Our
 free
 cash
 flow
 for
 the
 quarter
 was


approximately
 4
 billion
 which
 was
 yet


another
 record.
 Our
 total
 cash
 and


investments
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 quarter


were
 over
 41
 billion.


On
 the
 capex
 front,
 while
 we
 are


expecting
 to
 be
 around
 9
 billion
 for
 the


current
 year,
 we're
 projecting
 the


numbers
 to
 increase
 substantially
 in


2026
 as
 we
 prepare
 the
 company
 for
 the


next
 phase
 of
 growth
 in
 terms
 of
 not


just
 our
 existing
 businesses,
 but
 our


bets
 around
 AI
 initiatives,
 including


Optimus.


In
 conclusion,
 note
 that
 bringing
 AI


into
 real
 world
 is
 hard,
 but
 we
 have


never
 shied
 away
 from
 doing
 what
 is


hard.
 We
 are
 extremely
 excited
 about
 the


future
 and
 are
 laying
 down
 the


foundation,
 the
 benefits
 of
 which
 will


be
 realized
 over
 years
 to
 come.
 I
 would


like
 to
 end
 by
 thanking
 the
 Tesla
 team,


our
 customers,
 our
 investors
 and


supporters
 for
 the
 continued
 belief
 in


us.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much,
 Bab.
 Now,
 let's
 go


to
 investor
 questions
 from
 say.com.
 The


first
 question
 is
 what
 are
 the
 latest


robo
 taxi
 metrics,
 fleet
 size,


cumulative
 miles,
 rides
 completed,


intervention
 rates,
 and
 when
 will
 safety


drivers
 be
 removed?
 What
 are
 the


obstacles
 still
 preventing
 unsupervised


FSD
 from
 being
 deployed
 to
 customer


vehicles?


>> All
 right,
 Q&A.


>> I'll
 start
 off
 with
 that
 and
 then
 Shock


can
 elaborate.
 Um
 but
 uh
 we
 we
 are


expecting
 to


have
 uh
 no
 safety
 drivers
 in
 uh
 at
 least


um
 large
 parts
 of
 Austin
 by
 the
 end
 of


this
 year.
 So
 within
 a
 few
 months
 uh
 we


expect
 to
 have
 no
 safety
 drivers
 um
 at


all
 um
 in
 at
 least
 in
 parts
 of
 Austin.


We're
 obviously
 being
 very
 cautious


about
 the
 deployment.
 So
 um
 so
 our
 goal


is
 to
 be
 actually
 be
 paranoid
 about


deployment
 because
 obviously
 even
 one


accident
 will
 be
 front
 page
 headline


news
 worldwide.
 So
 um
 you
 know
 it's


better
 for
 us
 to
 take
 a
 cautious


approach
 here.
 Um
 but
 we
 do
 expect
 to


have
 no
 no
 safety
 drivers
 in
 the
 car
 um


in
 Austin
 uh
 in
 within
 a
 few
 months.
 I


think
 that's
 perhaps
 the
 most
 important


uh
 data
 point.
 And
 then
 we
 we
 do
 expect


to
 be
 uh
 operating
 robo
 taxi
 in


uh
 I
 think
 about
 uh
 8
 to
 10
 metro
 areas


by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 Um
 you
 know
 it


depends
 on
 various
 regulatory
 approvals.


Um
 and
 um
 but
 you
 you
 can
 actually
 I


think
 most
 of
 our
 regulatory


applications
 are
 online.
 You
 can
 kind
 of


see
 them
 uh
 because
 they're
 they're


public
 information.
 Um
 but
 we
 expect
 to


be
 oper
 operating
 in
 Nevada
 and
 Florida


and
 Arizona
 um
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


Um
 Ashure.


>> Yeah,
 we
 we
 continue
 to
 operate
 our
 um


fleet
 in
 Austin
 without
 anyone
 in
 the


driver's
 seat.
 Uh
 when
 we
 have
 covered


more
 than
 a
 quarter
 million
 miles
 um


with
 that
 and
 then
 in
 the
 Bay
 Area
 where


we
 still
 have
 a
 person
 in
 the
 driver's


seat
 because
 of
 the
 regulations
 we
 cross


more
 than
 a
 million
 miles.
 Um
 so
 and
 we


continue
 to
 see
 that
 the
 fleet
 u
 robotic


fleet
 works
 really
 well.
 Customers
 are


really
 happy
 um
 and
 there's
 no
 notable


issues
 on
 the
 customer
 uh
 side.
 We
 have


customers
 have
 used
 FS
 supervised
 for
 a


total
 of
 6
 billion
 miles
 um
 as
 of


yesterday.
 Um
 so
 that's
 like
 a
 big


milestone.
 Uh
 and
 overall
 the
 safety


continues
 to
 be
 very
 good
 and
 as
 Elon


mentioned
 we
 are
 on
 um
 on
 track
 to


remove
 the
 person
 from
 inside
 the
 car


altogether.
 Uh
 starting
 with
 Austin.


>> Great.
 Uh
 the
 next
 question
 is
 what
 is


the
 demand
 uh
 and
 backlog
 for
 mega
 pack


power
 wall
 solar
 or
 energy
 storage


systems
 with
 the
 current
 AI
 boom?
 Is


Tesla
 planning
 to
 supply
 power
 to
 other


hyperscalers?


>> Thanks.
 Um
 demand
 for
 mega
 pack
 and


power
 wall
 continues
 to
 be
 really
 strong


into
 next
 year.
 We
 we
 received
 very


strong
 u
 positive
 customer
 feedback
 on


our
 mega
 black
 mega
 block
 product
 which


will
 begin
 shipping
 next
 year
 out
 of


Houston.


And
 we're
 seeing
 remarkable
 growth
 in
 in


the
 demand
 for
 AI
 and
 data
 center


applications
 as
 hyperscalers
 and


utilities
 have
 seen
 the
 versatility
 of


the
 mega
 product
 to
 increase
 reliability


and
 receive
 and
 and
 relieve
 grid


constraints
 as
 Elen
 was
 talking
 about.


We
 we've
 also
 seen
 a
 surge
 in


residential
 solar
 demand
 in
 the
 US
 due


to
 policy
 changes
 which
 we
 expect
 to


continue
 into
 the
 first
 half
 of
 2026
 as


we
 introduced
 a
 new
 solar
 lease
 product.


And
 we
 also
 began
 production
 of
 our


Tesla
 residential
 solar
 panel
 in
 our


Buffalo
 factory
 and
 we
 will
 be
 shipping


that
 to
 customers
 starting
 Q1.
 The
 panel


has
 industryleading
 aesthetics
 and
 shade


performance
 and
 demonstrates
 our


continued
 commitment
 to
 US


manufacturing.


Great.
 Uh,
 thank
 you,
 Mike.
 Um,


unfortunately,
 the
 next
 question
 is


related
 to
 future
 products.
 Uh,
 this
 is


not
 the
 appropriate
 venue
 to
 cover
 that,


so
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 skip
 it.
 Um


the
 question
 after
 that
 is
 what
 are
 the


present
 challenges
 in
 bringing
 optimist


to
 market
 considering
 app
 control


software
 engineering
 hardware
 training


general
 mobility
 models
 training
 task


specific
 models
 training
 voice
 models


implementing
 manufacturing
 and


establishing
 supply
 chains.


>> Yeah
 I
 mean
 bringing
 office
 optimist


market
 is
 is
 an
 incredibly
 difficult


task
 to
 be
 clear.
 It's
 it's
 not
 like


some
 walk
 in
 the
 park.
 um
 at
 at
 some


point.
 I
 mean
 at
 this
 actually


technically
 Optimus
 can
 walk
 in
 the
 park


right
 now.
 Um
 we
 and
 we
 do
 have
 Optimus


robots
 that
 walk
 around
 our
 offices
 uh


at
 our
 engineering
 headquarters
 in


PaloAlto,
 California
 uh
 basically
 24


hours
 a
 day,
 7
 days
 a
 week.
 Um,
 so
 any


visitors
 that
 come
 by,
 you
 actually
 um


you
 can
 you
 can
 stop
 to
 stop
 one
 of
 the


Optimus
 robots
 and
 uh
 ask
 it
 to
 take
 you


somewhere
 and
 it'll
 literally
 take
 you


to
 that
 meeting
 room
 or
 that
 location
 in


the
 building.
 Um
 so
 um
 I
 don't
 want
 to


downplay
 the
 difficulty
 of
 this.
 It's
 a


it's
 an
 incredibly
 difficult
 thing,


especially
 it's
 difficult
 to
 create
 a
 um


a
 hand
 that
 is
 as
 dextrous
 and
 capable


as
 the
 human
 hand,
 which
 is
 an


incredible
 the
 human
 hand
 is
 an


incredible
 thing.
 Um
 that
 the
 more
 you


study
 the
 human
 hand,
 the
 more


incredible
 you
 realize
 the
 human
 hand


is.
 And
 and
 why
 you
 need
 five,
 you
 know,


four
 fingers
 and
 a
 thumb,
 why
 the
 why


the
 fingers
 have
 certain
 degrees
 of
 move


of
 freedom.
 um
 you
 know
 why
 why
 the
 the


various
 muscles
 are
 of
 different


strengths.
 Um
 the
 fingers
 are
 of


different
 lengths.
 Um
 and
 uh
 it
 turns


out
 actually
 that
 that
 all
 that
 those


are
 all
 there
 for
 a
 reason.
 Um


and
 uh
 so
 making
 making
 it
 that
 the
 hand


and
 and
 human
 hand
 the
 the
 muscles
 of


that
 control
 your
 hand
 are
 actually


primarily
 in
 your
 forearm.
 Um
 the


Optimus
 hand
 and
 forearm
 is
 an


incredibly
 difficult
 engineering


challenge.
 Um
 it's
 I'd
 say
 it's
 a
 more


difficult
 than
 the
 rest
 of
 from
 an


electromechanical
 standpoint
 the
 forearm


and
 hand
 are
 is
 more
 difficult
 than
 the


entire
 rest
 of
 the
 robot.
 Um


so
 uh
 but
 really
 in
 order
 to
 have
 a
 a
 a


useful
 generalized
 robot
 you
 you
 do
 need


this
 you
 do
 need
 an
 incredible
 hand
 and


uh
 and
 you
 need
 the
 real
 world
 AI.
 Um,


and
 you
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 scale
 up
 that


production


um
 to
 have
 it
 be
 relevant
 because
 it's


not
 relevant
 if
 it's
 just
 a
 few
 hundred


robots.
 Um,
 but
 so
 you
 need
 to
 be
 able


to
 make
 uh
 Optimus
 robots
 at
 volumes


comparable
 to
 vehicles
 um
 if
 not


significantly
 higher.
 Um


so
 uh
 trying
 to
 make
 a
 million
 of


something
 per
 year
 mill
 trying
 to
 make
 a


million
 Optimus
 robots
 per
 year
 that


manufacturing
 challenge
 is
 immense


considering
 that
 the
 supply
 chain


doesn't
 exist.
 So
 with
 with
 cars
 you've


got
 an
 existing
 supply
 chain.
 With


computers
 you've
 got
 an
 existing
 supply


chain.
 With
 uh
 with
 a
 humanoid
 robot


there
 is
 no
 supply
 chain.
 Um
 so
 in
 order


to
 to
 manufacture
 that
 Tesla
 actually


has
 to
 be
 very
 vertically
 integrated
 uh


and
 manufacture


um


very
 deep
 into
 the
 supply
 chain


manufacture
 the
 parts
 internally
 because


there
 just
 is
 no
 supply
 chain.
 Um,


so,
 uh,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 the
 kind
 of


thing
 where
 I'm
 like,
 if
 I
 put
 myself
 in


the
 position
 of
 a
 startup
 trying
 to
 make


an
 off
 a
 humanoid
 robot,
 I'm
 like,
 I


don't
 know
 how
 to
 do
 it
 without,
 um,
 an


an
 immense
 amount
 of
 manufacturing


technology.
 Um


so
 that's
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 like


Tesla's
 in
 some
 almost
 a
 unique
 I
 think


I
 think
 unique
 position
 when
 you


consider
 manufacturing
 technology


scaling
 um
 real
 world
 AI
 and
 the
 and
 and


a
 truly
 dextrous
 hand.
 Uh
 those
 are
 the


generally
 the
 things
 that
 are
 missing


when
 you
 read
 about
 um
 other
 robots
 that


they
 just
 don't
 have
 those
 three
 things.


Um
 so
 you
 know
 I
 think
 we
 can
 achieve


all
 those
 things
 those
 those
 three


things
 with
 an
 immense
 amount
 of
 work.


Um


and
 um
 and
 that
 that
 is
 that
 is
 the
 game


plan.


So,
 um,


you
 know,
 my
 like
 like
 my,


you
 know,
 fundamental
 concern
 with


regard
 to
 how
 much
 voting
 control
 I
 have


in
 Tesla
 is
 if
 I
 go
 ahead
 and
 build
 this


enormous
 robot
 army,
 can
 I
 just
 be


ousted
 at
 some
 point
 in
 the
 future?
 Um,


that's
 my
 biggest
 concern.
 if
 I
 that's


that
 that
 is
 the
 the
 that
 is
 really
 the


only
 thing
 I'm
 trying
 to
 address
 with


with
 this
 uh
 so
 what's
 called


compensation
 but
 it's
 not
 like
 I'm
 going


to
 go
 expend
 the
 money
 it's
 just
 you


know
 if
 we
 build
 this
 robot
 army
 um
 do
 I


have
 at least
 uh
 a
 strong
 influence
 over


that
 robot
 on
 the
 not
 not
 control
 but
 a


strong
 influence
 that's
 that's
 what
 it


comes
 down
 to
 in
 a
 nutshell
 um
 like
 I


don't
 feel
 comfortable
 building
 that


robot
 on
 me
 if
 I
 don't
 have
 at least
 a


strong
 influence


Great.
 Thank
 you.
 Uh
 we've
 already


covered
 robo
 taxi
 expansion.
 Um


unfortunately
 the
 question
 after
 that
 is


another
 future
 product
 question.
 So


we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 skip
 that.
 Um
 the


next
 one
 though
 is
 can
 you
 update
 us
 on


the
 $16.5
 billion
 Samsung
 chip
 deal
 in


Taylor?
 Given
 the
 importance
 of


semiconductors
 to
 autonomy
 in
 Tesla's


AIdriven
 future,
 what
 gives
 you


confidence
 Samsung
 can
 fulfill
 AI6
 at


Tesla's
 timelines
 and
 achieve
 relatively


better
 yields
 and
 cost
 versus
 TS
 TSMC?


Okay,
 so
 I'm
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 quite
 a


long
 answer
 to
 this
 question
 because


it's
 because
 uh
 I
 have
 to
 unpack
 this


question
 and
 then
 and
 then
 answer
 the


unpacked
 version.
 Um,
 so,
 uh,
 first
 of


all,
 uh,
 I
 have
 nothing
 but
 great
 things


to
 say
 about
 Samsung.
 They're


an
 amazing
 company.
 Um,
 and
 Samsung,
 it


is
 worth
 noting,
 um,
 does
 manufacture,


um,
 our
 AI4
 computer
 and
 does
 a
 great


job
 doing
 that.
 Um
 so


um
 now
 w
 with
 the
 the
 AI5
 um
 and
 here's


I
 I
 need
 to
 make
 a
 point
 of


clarification
 relative
 to
 some
 comments


I've
 made
 publicly
 uh
 before
 which
 is


we're
 actually
 going
 to
 focus
 both
 TSMC


and
 Samsung
 initially
 on
 AI5.


So,
 um,
 the
 the
 AIF
 chip
 design
 by
 Tesla


is
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 an
 amazing
 design.


Um,


I
 have
 spent
 almost
 every
 weekend
 for


last


last
 few
 months
 uh
 with
 the
 chip
 design


team
 working
 on
 AI5.


And


I
 I
 don't
 hand
 out
 praise
 easily,
 but
 I


have
 to
 say
 that
 I
 think
 I
 think
 the


Tesla
 chip
 team
 is
 is
 really
 designing


an
 incredible
 chip
 here.
 This
 is
 by
 some


metrics
 the
 AI5
 chip
 will
 be
 40
 times


better
 than
 the
 AI4
 chip.
 Not
 40%,
 40


times.


um
 because
 we
 we
 have
 a
 detailed


understanding
 of
 the
 entire
 software
 and


hardware
 stack.
 So
 we're
 designing
 the


hardware
 to
 uh
 address
 all
 of
 the
 pain


points
 in
 software.
 Um,
 so
 I
 don't
 think


there
 there
 really
 isn't
 anyone
 that's


doing
 this
 the
 the
 entire
 stack
 um
 all


the
 way
 through
 real
 world
 uh
 you
 know


calibrating
 against
 the
 real
 world
 where


you've
 got
 cars
 and
 robots
 in
 real
 world


that
 like
 we
 we
 know
 what
 the
 chip
 needs


to
 do
 and
 we
 know
 what
 and
 just
 as


importantly
 we
 know
 what
 the
 chip
 does


doesn't
 need
 to
 do.


um
 you
 know
 to
 sort
 of
 give
 you
 some


examples
 here
 um
 with
 the
 AI5
 we
 we


deleted
 the
 um
 the
 legacy
 GPU
 or
 the
 the


traditional
 GPU
 which
 is
 it
 it's
 in
 AI4


um
 but
 AI5
 does
 not
 have
 um


we
 just
 just
 deleted
 the
 the
 legacy
 GPU


because
 it
 basically
 is
 a
 GPU
 um
 so
 uh


we
 also
 deleted
 image
 signal
 processor.


Um
 and


uh
 there's
 like
 a
 long
 list
 of
 actually


of
 deletions
 that
 are
 very
 important.
 Um


as
 a
 result
 of
 these
 deletions,
 we
 can


actually
 fit
 AI5


uh
 in
 a
 half
 reticle.
 Um,
 and
 w
 with


with
 with
 good
 margin
 for
 the
 traces


from
 the
 memory
 to
 the
 the
 the
 trip
 the


Tesla
 trip
 accelerators
 um
 the
 ARM
 the


ARM
 CPU
 cores
 um
 and
 um
 and
 the
 PCI
 X


sort
 of
 uh


the
 PCI
 blocks.
 So
 uh


this
 this
 is
 a
 beautiful
 chip.
 Um,


I've
 poured
 so
 much
 life
 energy
 into


this
 show
 personally.
 Um,
 and
 I'm
 I'm


confident
 this
 will
 be
 this
 is
 going
 to


be
 a
 winner
 next
 level.
 Um,
 so
 it
 makes


sense
 to
 have
 uh
 both
 Samsung
 and
 TSMC


focus
 on
 AI5.
 Um,


and
 so
 even
 like
 the
 technically
 the


Samsung
 FAB
 has
 slightly
 more
 advanced


equipment
 than
 the
 TSMC
 FAB.
 These
 will


be
 both
 being
 made
 in
 um
 in
 the
 US
 that


in
 one
 TSMC
 in
 Arizona,
 Samsung
 in


Texas.
 Um
 and
 uh
 but
 but
 it's
 uh
 it


we're
 going
 to
 make
 starting
 off
 just
 to


be
 confident
 of
 having
 our
 our
 goal


explicit
 goal
 is
 to
 have
 an
 over
 supply


of
 AI5
 chips.
 Um


because
 if
 if
 we
 we
 have
 too
 many
 AI5


chips
 for
 the
 cars
 and
 and and
 robots,


we
 we
 can
 always
 put
 them
 in
 the
 data


center.


So
 we
 already
 use
 AI4


uh
 for
 for
 training
 in
 in
 our
 data


center.
 So
 we
 use
 a
 combination
 of
 AI4


and
 uh
 Nvidia
 hardware.
 Um
 so
 um


we're
 not
 about
 to
 replace
 Nvidia
 to
 be


clear,
 but
 but
 but
 we
 do
 use
 both
 in


combination.
 um
 AI4
 and
 Nvidia
 hardware


and
 the
 AI5
 access
 production
 we
 can


always
 put
 in
 in
 our
 data
 centers.
 Um


you
 know
 Nvidia
 keeps
 it
 keeps
 improving


um
 the
 challenge
 that
 they
 have
 is
 that


they've
 got
 to
 satisfy
 a
 large
 range
 or


a
 lot
 of
 requirements
 from
 a
 lot
 of


customers
 but
 Tesla
 only
 has
 to
 satisfy


requirements
 from
 one
 customer
 that's


Tesla.
 that
 that
 makes
 the
 design
 job


radically
 easier
 and
 means
 we
 we
 can


delete
 um
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 complexity
 from


the
 chip.
 Like
 I
 can't
 emphasize
 how


important
 this
 is.
 Um
 so
 like
 when
 you


look
 at
 the
 various
 logic
 blocks
 in
 the


chip
 um
 as
 you
 increase
 the
 number
 of


logic
 blocks
 you
 also
 increase
 the
 uh


interconnections
 between
 the
 logic


blocks.
 So
 you
 can
 think
 of
 it
 like
 um


you
 know
 just
 highways
 like
 how
 many


highways
 do
 you
 need
 to
 connect
 the


various
 parts
 of
 the
 chip?
 Um,
 and


especially
 if
 you're
 not
 sure
 h
 how
 much


data
 is
 going
 to
 go
 between
 uh
 each
 uh


you
 know
 uh
 logic
 block
 on
 the
 chip,


then
 you
 you
 kind
 of
 end
 up
 having
 giant


highways
 going
 all
 over
 the
 place.
 Um


it's
 a
 very
 it
 like
 it
 becomes
 an
 almost


impossibly
 difficult
 uh
 design
 problem


and
 Nvidia's
 done
 an
 amazing
 job
 of


dealing
 with
 almost
 an
 impossibly


difficult
 set
 of
 requirements.
 Um
 but
 in


our
 case
 we
 we
 we're
 going
 for
 radical


simplicity.
 Um
 and
 the
 net
 effect
 is


that
 I
 I
 I
 think
 AI5
 will
 be
 the
 best


performance
 per
 watt.
 Um
 maybe
 by
 a


factor
 of
 two
 or
 three
 um
 and
 the
 best


performance
 per
 dollar
 for
 AI
 maybe
 by
 a


factor
 of
 10.


So
 you
 know
 that's


uh
 you
 know
 we
 we'll
 have
 to
 the
 proof's


in
 the
 pudding.
 So
 obviously
 we
 need
 to


actually
 get
 this
 ship
 made
 um
 and
 made


at
 scale.
 Uh
 but
 that's
 what
 it
 looks


like.


Great.
 Thank
 you,
 Elon.
 Uh
 we've
 already


covered
 uh
 unsupervised
 FSD.
 Um
 so
 the


next
 question
 is
 instead
 of
 trying
 to


replace
 hardware
 3
 with
 hardware
 4,
 why


not
 give
 an
 equal
 incentive
 to
 trade
 in


for
 a
 new
 vehicle?


>> Yeah,
 we've
 not
 completely
 given
 on
 upon


hardware
 3.
 However,
 over
 the
 last
 year,


we've
 offered
 the
 customers
 the
 option


to
 transfer
 FSD
 to
 their
 new
 vehicle,


which
 which
 at
 times
 we've
 been
 running


some
 promotions.
 If
 if
 they
 got
 FSD,


they
 can
 get
 better
 preferential
 rates.


So,
 we've
 been
 definitely
 taking
 care
 of


this,
 but
 we
 do
 want
 to
 solve
 autonomy


first
 and
 then
 we'll
 come
 back
 with
 a


way
 to
 take
 care
 of
 these
 customers.


These
 customers
 are
 very
 important.
 They


were
 the
 early
 adapters.
 For
 what
 it's


worth,
 my
 daily
 commuter
 is
 a
 hardware


three
 car
 which
 I
 use
 FSD
 on
 a
 daily


basis.
 So
 we
 will
 definitely
 take
 care


of
 you
 guys.


>> Great.
 Thank
 you.


>> In
 addition,
 um
 once
 the
 V14's
 release


series
 is
 fully
 done,
 we
 are
 planning
 on


working
 on
 a
 V14
 light
 version
 for


hardware
 3
 probably
 expected
 in
 Q2
 uh


next
 year.


Awesome.


Thanks,
 Ashoke.
 All
 righty.
 Um,
 our


final
 question
 from
 Se
 is,
 uh,
 how
 long


until
 we
 see
 self-driving
 Tesla


semi-truckss?
 Uh,
 and
 could
 you
 see
 this


technology
 replacing
 trains?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 guess
 I'll
 start
 with
 that


in
 terms
 of
 the
 semi
 uh,
 production
 plan


and
 schedule.
 So,
 the
 factory
 is
 is


going
 on
 schedule.
 We've,
 you
 know,


completed
 the
 building
 and
 are


installing
 the
 equipment
 now.
 Um,
 we've


got
 our
 fleet
 of
 validation
 trucks
 uh


driving
 on
 the
 road.
 We'll
 have
 larger


builds
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 this
 year
 and


then
 our
 first
 online
 builds
 in
 the


first
 part
 of
 next
 year.
 Uh,
 ramping


into,
 you
 know,
 the
 Q2
 timing
 with
 real


volume
 coming
 in
 the
 back
 half
 of
 the


year.
 Um,
 so
 that's
 going
 quite
 well
 and


and
 that's
 the
 first
 step
 obviously


getting
 autonomous
 uh
 trucks
 on
 the


road.
 Um,
 in
 terms
 of
 trains,
 you
 know,


they're
 really
 great
 for
 long


pointto-point
 deliveries.
 are
 super


efficient,
 but
 you
 know
 that
 last
 mile


the
 load
 unload
 uh
 can
 be
 better
 served


for
 shorter
 distances
 with
 autonomous


semis
 and
 that
 would
 be
 great
 and
 so
 we


do
 expect
 that
 to
 probably
 shift
 in
 as


we
 you
 know
 really
 as
 Elon
 said
 change


the
 way
 transportation
 is
 considered
 um


and
 so
 we're
 looking
 forward
 to
 that


timeline
 and
 Ashoke
 I
 know
 you
 uh
 can


can
 take
 the
 the
 full
 self-driving
 part


>> currently
 the
 team
 is
 like
 super
 focused


on
 uh
 solving
 for
 passenger
 vehicles


autonomy
 that
 said
 the
 same
 technology


will
 uh
 extend
 quite
 easily
 to
 the


symmetric
 once
 we
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of


data
 from
 the
 symmetrics.


>> Great.
 Uh
 and
 now
 we
 will
 move
 over
 to


analyst
 questions.
 Uh
 the
 first
 question


comes
 from
 Emanuel
 uh
 at
 Wolf.
 Uh


Emanuel,
 please
 go
 ahead
 and
 unmute


yourself.


>> Great.
 Uh
 thanks
 so
 much.
 Uh
 hi


everybody.
 Um
 so
 Elon
 you
 talked
 about


um
 expanding
 production
 of
 vehicles
 as


fast
 as
 possible
 now
 that
 you
 have


confidence
 in
 the
 unsupervised
 autonomy.


Um
 how
 should
 we
 think
 about
 that
 in
 the


context
 of
 your
 existing
 capacity
 of
 3


million
 units?
 Um
 is
 that
 um
 where


you're
 hoping
 to
 get
 volume
 to?
 What


sort
 of
 timeline
 are
 we
 talking
 about?


And
 uh
 would
 this
 require
 you
 know
 some


level
 of
 uh
 boosting
 or
 incentivizing


demand?
 Like
 would
 this
 basically
 be


prioritizing
 volume
 over
 near-term


profitability
 given
 the
 longerterm


opportunity?


>> Well,
 uh
 our
 capacity
 isn't
 quite
 3


million.
 Um
 but
 uh
 it
 it it
 will
 be
 3


million
 at
 some
 point.
 Um,
 you
 know,


aspirationally,
 you
 know,
 it
 could
 be
 3


million
 within
 we
 could
 probably
 hit
 an


annualized
 rate
 of
 3
 million
 within
 24


months,
 I
 think.
 Um,
 maybe
 less
 than
 24


months.
 Um,
 bearing
 in
 mind
 like
 there's


there's
 an
 entire
 like
 supply
 chain
 like


a
 vast
 supply
 chain
 that's
 got
 to
 also


move
 in
 tandem
 with
 that.
 Um,


so
 but
 we're
 going
 to
 we're
 we're
 going


to
 expand
 uh
 production
 as
 fast
 as
 as
 uh


as
 as
 as
 we
 can.
 Um
 as
 fast
 as
 our


suppliers
 can
 can
 um


can
 sort
 of
 keep
 up
 with
 it.
 Um
 and
 then


we
 got
 to
 think
 about
 uh
 where
 where
 do


we
 build
 incremental
 factories
 uh
 beyond


that
 um
 like
 the
 single
 biggest
 uh


expansion
 in
 production
 will
 be
 the
 the


cyber
 cab
 which
 starts
 production
 um
 in


Q2
 next
 year.
 Um
 that's
 uh
 that's
 really


a
 vehicle
 that's
 optimized
 for
 full


autonomy.
 Uh
 it
 in
 fact
 does
 not
 have
 a


steering
 wheel
 or
 pedals
 um
 and
 is


really
 um
 an
 engineering
 optimization
 on


minimizing
 cost
 per
 like
 fully


considered
 cost
 per
 mile
 of
 operation.


Um,
 so
 that's,
 you
 know,
 we
 for
 for
 the


other
 for
 the
 for
 our
 other
 vehicles,


there's
 still
 they
 still
 have
 a
 little


bit
 of
 the
 horseless
 carriage
 thing


going
 on
 where,
 you
 know,
 obviously


you've
 got
 if
 you
 still
 if
 you've
 got


steering
 wheels
 and
 pedals
 and
 um
 and


and
 you're
 designing
 a
 car
 that
 uh


people
 might
 want
 to
 go,
 you
 know,
 very


do
 right
 fast
 acceleration
 and
 tight


cornering
 like
 high
 performance
 car,
 you


know,
 cars,
 then
 you're
 going
 to
 design


a
 different
 car
 than
 one
 that
 is


optimized
 for
 a
 comfortable
 ride
 um
 but


doesn't
 expect
 to
 go,
 you
 know,
 past


sort
 of
 85
 or
 90
 mph.
 Um,
 and
 it's
 it's


just
 aiming
 for
 a
 gentle
 ride
 the
 whole


time.
 That's
 what
 cyber
 cap
 is.
 Um,


so,
 um,


yeah.
 So,
 so
 it's


do
 I
 think
 we'll
 sacrifice
 margins?
 Uh,


I
 don't
 think
 so.
 Um,
 I
 think
 the
 demand


will
 be
 pretty
 nutty.
 Um,
 like
 here's


the
 here's
 the
 killer
 app.
 Really,
 what


it
 comes
 down
 to
 is
 can
 you
 text?
 Can


you
 text
 while
 you're
 in
 the
 car?
 And
 if


you
 tell
 someone,
 yes,
 the
 the
 car
 is


now
 so
 good,
 you
 can
 you
 can
 you
 can
 be


on
 your
 phone
 uh
 and
 text
 the
 entire


time
 while
 you're
 in
 the
 car.
 It's


anyone
 who
 can
 buy
 the
 car
 will
 buy
 the


car
 and
 and
 a
 story.


Um
 so
 um
 that's
 what
 everybody
 wants
 to


do.
 In
 fact,
 not
 everyone
 wants
 to
 do


it.
 do
 do
 that
 and
 that's
 why
 in
 fact


the
 reason
 you've
 seen
 like
 that
 there's


been
 an
 uptick
 in
 accidents
 uh
 pretty


much
 worldwide
 is
 because
 people
 are


texting
 and
 driving.
 Um
 so
 uh
 autopilot


actually
 dramatically
 improves
 the


safety
 here
 um
 because
 if
 somebody's


looking
 down
 at
 their
 phone
 they're
 not


driving
 very
 well.
 Um
 so
 that's
 that's


really
 the
 the
 game
 changer.
 Um
 and
 uh


you
 know
 we
 we
 do
 see
 like
 at
 this
 point


I
 feel


you
 know
 essentially
 100%
 confident
 I


say
 not
 essentially
 100%
 confident
 that


we
 can
 set
 that
 we
 can
 solve


unsupervised
 full
 self-driving
 at
 a


safety
 level
 um
 much
 greater
 than
 human.


Um


uh
 so
 we've
 released
 14.1.
 We've
 got
 a


technology
 roadmap
 that's
 I
 think
 pretty


amazing.
 We'll
 be
 adding
 reasoning
 to


the
 car.
 Uh
 uh
 our
 world
 simulator
 for


sim
 for
 reinforcement
 learning
 is
 is


pretty
 incredible.
 like
 our
 like
 our


when
 you
 see
 that
 the
 Tesla
 reality


simulator
 um
 it's
 you
 can't
 tell
 the


difference
 between
 the
 video
 that's


generated
 by
 the
 Tesla
 reality
 simulator


and
 the
 the
 actual
 video
 looks
 exactly


the
 same.
 Um
 so
 that
 that
 that
 allows
 us


to
 um
 have
 a
 very
 powerful
 reinforcement


learning
 loop
 uh
 to
 further
 improve
 the


Tesla
 AI.
 we're
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 in


increasing
 the
 parameter
 count
 by
 an


order
 of
 magnitude.
 Um
 that
 that's
 not


in
 14.1.
 Um
 there
 are
 also
 a
 number
 of


other
 improvements
 to
 the
 AI
 just
 um


that
 that
 are
 that
 are
 quite
 radical.
 Um


so
 it's
 uh


this
 car
 will
 feel
 like
 it
 is
 a
 living


creature.
 That's
 how
 good
 the
 AI
 will


get
 with
 the
 AI
 full
 computer
 with
 this


before
 AI5.
 And
 then
 and
 then
 AI5
 like
 I


said
 is
 by
 some
 metrics
 40
 40
 times


better.
 Um
 let's
 just
 say
 safely
 it's
 a


10x
 improvement.
 Um
 so
 it
 might
 almost


be
 too
 much
 intelligence
 for
 a
 car.
 I
 do


wonder
 like
 how
 much
 intelligence
 should


you
 have
 in
 a
 car?
 It
 might
 get
 bored.


Um


actually
 um
 and
 then
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I


thought
 like
 well
 if
 we
 got
 all
 these


cars
 that
 maybe
 are
 bored
 well
 why


they're
 while
 they're
 sort
 of
 if
 they


are
 bored
 we
 could
 actually
 have
 a
 giant


distributed
 inference
 fleet
 and
 say
 like


well
 if
 they're
 not
 actively
 driving


let's
 just
 have
 a
 giant
 distributed


inference
 fleet.


um
 you
 know
 at
 some
 point
 if
 if
 you've


got
 like
 tens
 of
 millions
 of
 cars
 in
 the


fleet
 or
 maybe
 at
 some
 point
 100
 million


cars
 in
 the
 fleet
 um
 and
 um


let's
 say
 they
 had
 at
 at
 that
 point
 you


know
 u


I
 don't
 know
 uh
 a
 kilowatt
 of
 inference


capability
 of
 you
 know
 high
 performance


inference
 capability
 that's
 100
 gawatt


of
 inference


distributed


with
 with
 power
 and
 cooling
 taken
 w
 with


with
 cooling
 and
 and
 power
 conversion


taken
 care
 of.


So


that
 seems
 like
 a
 pretty
 significant


asset.


Great.
 Thanks,
 Elon.
 Uh
 the
 next


question
 comes
 from
 Adam
 uh
 from
 Morgan


Stanley.
 Adam,
 please
 feel
 free
 to


unmute
 yourself.


Uh,
 Adam,
 go
 ahead
 and
 ask
 your


question.


Seems
 like
 we
 might
 be
 having
 some
 audio


issues
 with
 Adam.
 Uh,
 so
 we'll
 come
 back


to
 you.
 Um,
 the
 next
 question
 will
 then


come
 from
 Dan
 uh
 from
 Barclays.


>> Hi,
 good
 evening.
 Thank
 you
 for
 uh


taking
 uh
 the
 question.
 Um
 Elon,
 I
 I


know
 that
 uh
 Tesla's
 really
 focused
 on


with
 master
 plan
 4
 bringing
 AI
 into
 the


physical
 world
 and
 I
 think
 we've
 seen


over
 the
 past,
 you
 know,
 this


willingness
 for
 Tesla
 to
 engage
 and
 and


go
 into
 new
 markets,
 new
 TAMs.
 So
 when


you
 think
 about
 the
 growth
 prospects,


how
 do
 we
 define
 the
 areas
 that
 are


really
 within
 Tesla's
 core
 competency


versus
 where
 do
 you
 draw
 the
 line
 for


markets
 or
 AI
 applications
 that
 are


outside
 of
 Tesla's
 core
 competency?


>> Um,
 actually
 I'm
 not
 sure
 what
 you
 mean


by
 AI
 applications
 outside
 of
 Tesla's


core
 competency.
 Um
 but
 uh
 I
 we
 we
 kind


of
 we
 didn't
 have
 any
 of
 these
 core


competencies
 when
 we
 started
 you
 know
 um


so
 it's
 like
 we
 had
 zero
 core


competencies
 total
 competency
 of
 zero


actually
 um
 so
 I
 mean
 you
 can
 think
 of


Tesla
 as
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 a
 dozen


startups
 in
 one
 company
 um


you
 know
 and
 and
 uh
 I've
 initiated
 every


one
 of
 those
 startups
 so
 it's
 uh
 you


used
 to
 make
 battery
 packs
 say


stationary
 battery
 packs
 but
 now
 we
 do


we
 make
 them
 for
 the
 home
 make
 them
 for


you
 know
 utility
 scale
 with
 power
 wall


mega
 pack
 uh
 we
 created
 the
 supercharger


network
 globally
 uh
 no
 one
 no
 one
 else


has
 created
 a
 global
 supercharge
 network


in
 fact
 North
 American
 supercharge


network
 is
 so
 good
 at
 that
 that


basically
 that
 every
 other
 manufacturer


in
 North
 America
 has
 converted
 to
 our


standard
 um
 and
 uses
 our
 the
 Tesla


supercharger
 network
 um
 but
 if
 it
 so


easy,
 why
 don't
 they
 just
 do
 it?
 Um,
 and


uh,
 the
 chip
 design
 team
 um,
 started


that
 from
 scratch.
 The
 Tesla
 AI
 software


team
 was
 started
 from
 scratch.
 Um,
 I


literally
 just
 say,
 "Hey,
 we're
 going
 to


start
 this
 thing."
 I
 posted
 on
 Twitter


now
 X
 and
 then,
 you
 know,
 join
 us
 if


you'd
 like
 to
 build
 it.
 Um
 in
 fact
 uh


Ashok
 was
 I
 believe
 the
 first
 person
 I


interviewed
 for
 the
 Tesla
 autopilot
 team


which
 we
 now
 call
 Tesla
 AI
 software
 team


because
 it
 is
 the
 AI
 software
 team.
 Um


so
 you
 know
 it's
 core
 companies
 comp
 is


created
 while
 you
 wait.
 Um


and
 um


you
 know
 Optimus
 at
 scale
 it
 is
 the


infinite
 money
 glitch.
 It's
 like
 this
 is


a


It's
 difficult
 to
 express
 the
 magnitude


of
 like
 if
 you've
 got
 um


something
 that
 like
 that


like
 if
 Optimus
 I
 think
 probably
 achieve


5x
 the
 productivity
 of
 a
 person
 per
 year


because
 it
 can
 operate
 24/7.
 Um
 it


doesn't
 even
 need
 to
 charge.
 It
 can


operate
 it
 tethered.
 Uh
 so
 it's
 it's


plugged
 in
 the
 whole
 time.
 Um


and
 um


what
 so
 it
 that's
 that's
 why
 I
 call
 it


like
 a
 future
 of
 sustainable
 abundance


um
 where
 working
 will
 be
 optional.
 You


know
 there's
 there's
 a
 limit
 to
 how
 much


how
 much
 AI
 can
 do
 in
 terms
 of
 enhancing


the
 productivity
 of
 humans.
 Um
 but
 there


is
 not
 really
 a
 limit
 to


uh
 AI
 that
 is
 embodied.


That's
 why
 I
 call
 it
 the
 infinite
 money


glitch.


I
 mean
 one
 thing
 which
 I'll
 further
 add


is
 I
 mean
 people
 forget
 like
 our
 first


iteration
 of
 autopilot
 was
 10
 years


back.
 So
 you
 know
 Elon
 had
 started
 this


way
 back
 in
 the
 day.


>> We
 got
 the
 tweets
 to
 prove
 it.


>> Exactly.
 And
 then
 even
 even
 on
 the


optimist
 side
 right
 as
 much
 as
 people


think
 okay
 this
 is
 a
 new
 thing
 I
 still


remember
 was
 it
 four
 plus
 years
 back
 we


were
 in
 a
 finance
 meeting
 with
 Elon
 and


Elon
 said
 hey
 our
 car
 is
 a
 robot
 on


wheels
 and
 that's
 where
 we
 we
 started


developing
 in
 fact
 most
 of
 the


engineering
 team
 which
 is
 working
 on


Optimus
 has
 come
 from
 the
 vehicle
 side


and
 that's
 why
 you
 know
 when
 we
 talk


about
 manufacturing
 provice


we
 have
 the
 wherewithal
 because
 the
 same


engineers
 who
 worked
 in
 the
 back
 in
 the


day
 on
 drive
 units
 are
 working
 on


actuators
 now.
 So
 that's
 where
 we
 can
 do


if
 there
 is
 any
 company
 which
 can
 do
 it


at
 scale
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 us.


>> But
 we
 we
 also
 have
 actually
 added
 a
 lot


of
 new
 engineers
 as
 well
 to
 the
 team.
 So


there's
 actually
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 credit


for
 the
 Optimus
 engineering
 is
 is


actually
 also
 new
 new
 engineers
 many
 of


them
 that
 are
 just
 out
 of
 college


actually.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 so
 uh
 the
 optimist
 engineering


uh
 team
 is
 a
 very
 talented
 engineering


team
 um
 to
 like
 wow
 actually
 so


um
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 Optimus
 reviews


at
 this
 point
 are
 there's
 the
 the


engineering
 review
 um
 and
 then
 there's


the
 manufacturing
 review
 being
 done
 it's


simult
 simultaneously


um
 with
 an
 iter
 iterative
 loop
 between


engineering
 design
 and
 and
 manufacturing


because
 then
 we
 see
 we
 we we
 design


something
 and
 we
 say
 like
 oh
 man
 that's


really
 difficult
 to
 make
 we
 need
 to


change
 that
 design
 to
 make
 it
 easier
 to


manufacture
 um
 so
 we
 made
 radical


improvements
 to
 the
 design
 of
 Optimus
 um


while
 increasing
 the
 functionality
 but


making
 it
 actually
 possible
 to


manufacture
 like
 I'd
 say
 Optimus
 2
 is


almost
 impossible
 to
 manufacture
 frankly


um
 but
 um
 my
 two
 bipols
 point
 we've
 gone


from
 uh
 you
 know
 a
 person
 in
 a
 robot


outfit
 to
 uh
 what
 what
 people
 have
 seen


with
 Optimus
 2.5
 where
 it's
 doing
 kung


fu
 um
 you
 know
 was
 like
 Optimus
 was
 at


the
 uh
 at
 the
 Tron
 premiere
 um
 doing


kung
 fu
 you
 know
 just
 out
 in
 the
 open


you
 know
 like
 with
 Jared
 Leto


like
 there
 wasn't
 uh
 nobody
 was


controlling
 it
 was
 just
 doing
 kung
 fu


with
 Jared
 Leto
 uh
 you
 know
 at
 the
 Kron


premiere
 Um
 you
 can
 see
 the
 videos


online.
 Um
 and
 um
 actually
 the
 funny


thing
 is
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 walked


past
 it
 uh
 thinking
 it
 was
 uh
 just
 a


person
 even
 though
 with
 Optimus


uh
 2.5
 you
 can
 see
 that
 it
 has
 you
 know


a
 waist
 that's
 3
 in
 wide
 which
 is


obviously
 not
 a
 human.
 Um
 so


uh
 but
 but
 the
 movements
 were
 so


humanlike
 that
 people
 didn't
 realize
 a


lot
 of
 people
 didn't
 realize
 they
 were


looking
 at
 a
 robot.
 So


um


and
 what
 I'm
 saying
 is
 like
 Optimus
 3


will
 be
 a
 giant
 improvement
 on
 that


um
 animated
 scale.


Um
 but
 like
 I
 said
 a
 very
 difficult


thing
 um
 you
 know
 the
 the
 Optimus
 uh


sort
 of
 engineering
 and
 manufacturing


reviews
 and
 there's
 the
 Friday
 night


meeting
 with
 Optimus
 which
 sometimes


goes
 till
 midnight.
 Um
 and
 then
 my


Saturday
 meeting
 is
 is
 with
 the
 is
 is


the
 Saturday
 afternoon
 is
 with
 the
 the


AI
 five
 chip
 design
 team.
 Um


so
 um
 those
 two
 things
 are
 uh
 crucial
 to


the
 future
 of
 the
 company.


>> And
 Dan,
 did
 you
 follow
 up?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean


just
 as
 a
 related
 maybe
 you
 could
 just


talk
 about
 to
 what
 extent
 are
 the
 AI


efforts
 at
 Tesla
 and
 XAI
 complimentary


or
 are
 they
 just
 different
 forms
 of
 AI?


Maybe
 you
 can
 just
 help
 distinguish
 for


the
 audience.
 Thank
 you.


>> Yeah,
 there
 are
 different
 forms
 of
 AI.


Um,
 so


the


you
 know
 the


the
 XI
 so
 Grock
 is
 like
 a
 a
 giant
 model


that
 that
 uh
 you
 could
 not
 you
 could
 not


possibly
 squeeze
 Grock
 uh
 onto
 a
 car.


That's
 for
 sure.
 It
 is
 a
 giant
 beast
 of


a
 model.
 It's
 with
 with
 Grock
 it's


trying
 to
 say
 solve
 for
 artificial


general
 intelligence
 with
 a
 massive


amount
 of
 AI
 training
 compute
 and
 and


inference
 compute.
 Um
 so
 for
 example
 Gro


5
 will
 actually
 only
 run
 effectively
 on


a
 GV300.
 That's
 that's
 how
 much
 of
 a


beast
 that
 Gro
 5
 is.
 uh
 um
 so
 uh
 you


know
 whereas
 Tesla's
 uh


you
 know
 models
 are
 I
 don't know
 maybe


about
 less
 than
 10%
 the
 size
 maybe


closer
 to
 5%
 the
 size
 of
 of
 of


um
 so


yeah
 they're
 they're
 they're
 really


coming
 at
 the
 problem
 from
 very


different
 um
 angles


um
 XA
 and
 Grock
 are
 you
 know
 they're


competing
 with
 um


uh
 you
 know
 Google
 Gemini
 and
 opening
 ad


chat
 GBT
 and
 that
 kind
 of
 thing.
 Um
 so


um
 and
 some
 of
 it's
 complimentary.
 I


mean
 for
 for
 example
 for
 Grock
 voice
 uh


being
 able
 to
 interact
 with
 Grock
 in
 the


car
 is
 cool.
 Um
 Grock
 uh
 for
 you
 know


Optimus
 voice
 recognition
 and
 what
 voice


generation
 uh
 is
 Grock.
 So
 that's
 that's


helpful
 there.
 But
 they
 are
 uh
 coming
 at


it
 from
 kind
 of
 opposite
 ends
 of
 the


spectrum.


>> All
 righty.
 Um
 Adam,
 let's
 give
 it


another
 try.
 Uh
 when
 you're
 ready,


please
 unmute
 yourself
 for
 the
 next


question.


All
 righty.
 Unfortunately,
 uh
 still


having
 audio
 issues.
 So
 we're
 going
 to


move
 on
 to
 uh
 Walt
 from
 Lightshed.


Walt,
 please
 go
 ahead
 and
 unmute


yourself.


>> Can
 you
 hear
 me
 now?


>> Yes.


>> Perfect.
 Thank
 you.
 Um


um
 just
 getting
 back
 to
 Austin,
 if
 if


you
 can
 remove
 the
 safety
 driver
 at
 your


end,
 um
 is
 the
 limitation
 in
 the
 Bay


Area
 just
 regulatory
 or
 is
 it
 kind
 of


the
 market
 bymarket
 learning
 process?


And
 I
 guess
 similarly
 in
 the
 8
 to
 10


markets
 that
 you
 mentioned
 to
 get
 added,


is
 the
 decision
 there
 to
 put,
 you
 know,


a
 safety
 attendant
 in
 the
 passenger
 seat


or
 the
 safety
 driver
 in
 is
 that
 like


your
 step-by-step
 process
 to
 opening
 up


a
 market
 or
 is
 it
 really
 just
 the


regulation
 in
 the
 individual
 market?


>> Well,
 it's
 I
 think
 I
 think
 even
 if
 the


regulators
 weren't
 making
 us
 do
 it,
 we'd


still
 do
 that
 as
 the
 as
 the
 sort
 of


right
 sort
 of
 cautious
 approach
 to
 a
 new


market.
 So,
 just
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we're


being,
 you
 know,
 paranoid
 about
 safety,


uh,
 I
 think
 it
 makes
 sense
 to
 have
 a


sort
 of,
 uh,
 a
 sort
 of
 either
 safety


driver
 or
 safety
 occupant
 in
 the
 car.


Um,
 when
 we
 first
 go
 to
 New
 Markets
 to


just
 to
 confirm
 that
 there's
 not


something
 we're
 missing.
 Um,
 because
 all


it
 takes
 is
 like
 one
 in
 10,000
 trips
 to


go
 wrong
 and
 and
 you've
 got
 you've
 got


an
 issue.
 So,
 um
 it's
 it
 just
 to
 make


sure
 like
 is
 is
 there
 some
 peculiarity


about
 a
 city
 like
 a
 very
 difficult


intersection
 um
 or
 I
 don't
 know


something
 that's
 that's
 an
 unexpected


challenge
 uh
 in
 in
 a
 city
 uh
 for
 that


one
 in
 10,000
 situation.
 Um,
 so


um


I
 think
 we
 we
 probably
 could
 just
 let
 it


loose
 in
 in
 this
 in
 these
 cities,
 but
 we


just
 don't
 want
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 take
 a


chance.
 And
 and
 and
 like
 you
 know
 what


we're
 talking
 about
 here
 is
 um
 you
 know


maybe
 3
 months
 of
 safety
 driver
 in
 in
 a


new
 metro
 to
 confirm
 that
 it's
 good
 and


then
 we
 take
 the
 safety
 driver
 out
 that


that
 kind
 of
 thing.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 And
 then
 on
 on
 FSD14,


it
 has
 a
 different
 feel
 than
 13
 and
 it's


also
 I
 think
 a
 little
 different
 than


what
 it
 feels
 like
 in
 Austin.
 Are
 you
 is


it
 basically
 de
 different
 development


paths
 path
 that
 you're
 doing
 in
 terms
 of


the
 robo
 taxi
 stuff
 versus
 what
 you're


dropping
 to
 the
 early
 adopters?
 And
 when


you
 and
 when
 you
 push
 these
 new
 builds,


is
 it
 that
 you're
 you're
 looking
 for


notable
 improvements
 in
 intervention


rates?
 um
 or
 is
 that
 largely
 solved
 and


it's
 more
 about
 adding
 the
 functionality


like
 the
 parking,
 the
 drive
 modes
 or


just
 the
 overall
 comfort?


>> No,
 the
 first
 priority
 when
 we
 release
 a


a
 major
 new
 software
 architecture
 for


autopilot
 is
 safety.
 So,
 so
 it's
 it


starts
 off
 with
 safety
 pri
 obviously


safety
 prioritized
 and
 then
 we've
 and


then
 we
 solve
 comfort
 thereafter
 which


is
 why
 I
 don't
 recommend
 people
 take
 the


the
 initial
 version
 like
 like
 that's
 why


I
 say
 like
 you
 know
 most
 people
 should


wait
 until
 14.2
 for
 before
 they
 actually


download
 uh
 version
 14
 um
 because
 by


14.2
 to
 we
 will
 have
 addressed
 many
 of


the
 comfort
 issues.
 Um
 the
 priority
 is


is
 very
 much
 safety
 first
 and
 then


thereafter
 the
 comfort
 issues.
 That's


why
 most
 people
 I'm
 like
 probably
 it'll


be
 a
 little
 like
 it'll
 be
 safe
 but


jerky.


Um
 and
 uh
 we
 just
 need
 time
 to
 kind
 of


smooth
 the
 rough
 edges
 um
 and
 sulfur


comfort
 in
 addition
 to
 safety
 with
 a


with
 a
 major
 news
 uh


autopilot
 architecture
 uh
 change.
 Um


but
 uh
 it
 really
 is
 uh
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 I
 know


what
 the
 you
 know
 the
 road
 map
 is
 for


the
 Tesla
 real
 world
 AI
 and
 and
 at
 a


very
 granular
 detail.
 Obviously,
 Ashok


is
 leading
 that.
 Um,
 and
 I
 and
 I
 I
 mean,


I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 with
 the
 team


going,
 you
 know,
 in
 in


like


excruciating
 detail
 here
 on
 on
 what
 what


we're
 doing
 to
 improve
 the
 real
 world


AI.
 Um,
 and
 um,
 like
 I
 said,
 this
 this


car
 is
 going
 to
 feel
 like
 it
 is
 a
 living


creature.
 And
 that's
 with
 AI
 4
 before


even
 AI
 5.


>> Yeah,
 the
 road
 map
 is
 super


exhilarating.
 like
 it's
 like
 so
 like


waiting
 so
 much
 like
 release
 all
 the


stuff
 we
 are
 working
 on
 in
 terms
 of
 like


you
 know
 what
 we
 ship
 to
 customers


versus
 robot
 taxi
 uh
 it's
 mo
 mostly
 the


same
 obviously
 customers
 have
 some
 more


features
 like
 you
 know
 they
 can
 choose


the
 car
 wants
 to
 park
 in
 a
 spot
 or


driveway
 or
 something
 like
 that
 which
 is


not
 super
 relevant
 for
 robot
 taxi
 uh
 but


there's
 only
 like
 a
 few
 minor
 changes


like
 those
 ones
 but
 the
 majority
 of
 the


algorithms
 and
 architecture
 everything


is
 the
 same
 between
 those
 two
 platforms


>> yeah
 but
 as
 I
 mentioned
 earlier
 We'll
 be


adding
 reasoning
 to
 um
 I
 don't
 know
 sh


is
 that
 like
 reasoning
 in
 like
 14.3


maybe
 14.4
 something
 like
 that.


>> Yeah,
 by
 this
 year
 for
 sure.


>> Yeah.
 So
 with
 reasoning
 it's
 literally


going
 to
 think
 about
 which
 parking
 spot


to
 pick
 uh
 at
 this.
 So
 it's
 going
 to
 say


this
 is
 the
 entrance
 but
 actually


probably
 there's
 not
 a
 parking
 spot


right
 at
 the
 entrance.
 if
 it's
 a
 a
 full,


you
 know,
 if
 the
 if
 the
 parking
 lot
 is


fairly
 full,
 the
 probability
 of
 a
 open


parking
 spot
 right
 at
 the
 entrance
 is


very
 low.
 Um,
 but
 actually
 what
 it'll


simply
 do
 is
 drop
 you
 off
 at
 the


entrance
 of
 the
 store
 and
 then
 go
 find
 a


parking
 spot.
 Um,
 but
 it's
 it's
 going
 to


get
 very
 smart
 about
 figuring
 out
 a


parking
 spot.
 It's
 going
 to
 spot
 figure


out
 it's
 going
 to
 spot
 empty
 spots
 much


better
 than
 human.
 It's
 got
 360
 degree


vision.
 Um
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 yeah
 like
 I


said
 just
 it's
 it's
 going
 to
 re
 use


reasoning
 to
 solve
 things


>> and
 putting
 that
 all
 inside
 the
 computer


that
 has
 A4
 is
 the
 actual
 challenge


that's
 what
 the
 team
 is
 working
 on


because
 obviously
 you
 can
 do
 reasoning


on
 the
 server
 that
 takes
 forever
 but


then
 in
 car
 you
 need
 to
 make
 realtime


decisions
 um
 so
 fitting
 all
 into
 the


computer
 that's
 in
 the
 car
 that's
 the


challenge.
 Yeah,
 that's
 why
 I
 say
 like


like
 and
 I
 have
 a
 pretty
 good


understanding
 of
 like
 AI,
 you
 know,
 the


sort
 of
 the
 giant
 model
 level
 with
 Grock


and
 with
 with
 Tesla
 and
 like
 I'm


confident
 in
 saying
 that
 Tesla
 has
 the


the
 Tesla
 AI
 has
 the
 highest


intelligence
 density
 when
 you
 look
 at


the
 the
 intelligence
 per
 gigabyte.
 Um
 I


think
 like
 Tesla
 AI
 is
 probably
 an
 order


of
 magnitude
 better
 than
 anyone
 else.
 Um


and
 doesn't
 have
 any
 choice
 because
 that


that
 AI
 has
 got
 to
 fit
 in
 the
 AI4


computer.
 Um
 the
 but
 the
 the
 discipline


of
 having
 that
 level
 of
 AI
 intelligence


density
 u
 will
 pay
 great
 dividends
 when


you
 go
 to
 something
 that
 has
 an
 order
 of


magnitude
 order
 of
 magnitude
 more


capability
 like
 AI5.


Now
 you
 have
 that
 same
 intelligence


density
 but
 but
 you
 got
 10
 times
 more


capability
 in
 the
 computer.


Great.
 Uh
 the
 next
 question
 will
 come


from
 Colin
 at
 Oppenheimer.
 Uh
 Colin,


please
 unmute
 yourself
 when
 you're


ready.


Colin,
 go
 ahead
 and
 unmute
 yourself,


please.


>> Thanks
 so
 much,
 guys.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 I


appreciate
 you
 bringing
 up
 the
 the


challenges
 of
 hand
 dexterity
 and


humanoids.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 along
 with
 the


complexity
 of
 the
 supply
 chain
 and
 the


the
 vertical
 integration
 you
 guys
 are


pursuing.
 You
 know,
 I'm
 just
 trying
 to


harmonize
 the
 the
 timeline
 for
 the
 start


of
 production,
 you
 know,
 next
 year
 with


the
 current
 state
 of
 the
 supply
 chain


and
 what
 sounds
 like
 a
 fair
 amount
 of


work
 remaining
 on
 the
 dexterity
 uh


before
 you
 can
 really
 freeze
 the


hardware
 design
 and
 and
 start
 to
 scale


up
 production.


Um
 well,
 we're
 not
 the
 hardware
 design


will
 not
 actually
 be
 frozen
 even
 through


start
 of
 production.
 Um
 there'll
 be


continued
 iteration.
 um
 because
 a
 bunch


of
 the
 things
 that
 you
 discover
 are
 very


difficult
 to
 make.
 You
 only
 find
 that


pretty
 late
 in
 the
 game.
 So,
 we'll
 be


doing
 rolling
 changes
 of
 for
 the
 Optimus


design
 even
 after
 solder
 production.
 Um,


but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 the
 the
 you
 know
 the


new
 hand
 is


um
 an
 incredible
 piece
 of
 engineering


and
 uh


you
 know
 that's
 you
 like
 we'll
 have
 um
 a


production
 intent
 prototype
 uh
 ready
 to


show
 off
 in
 you
 know
 Q1
 probably


February
 or
 March.
 Um,


and
 then
 we're
 uh,


yeah,
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 building
 a,
 you


know,
 million
 unit
 Optimus
 production


line.
 Um,


you
 know,
 hopefully
 with
 a
 production


start
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 next
 year.


Um,
 but
 that
 that
 production
 ramp
 will


take
 a
 while
 to
 get
 to
 annualized
 rate


of
 a
 million
 because
 it's
 going
 to
 move


as
 fast
 as
 the
 the
 slowest,
 dumbest,


least
 lucky
 thing
 out
 of
 10,000
 unique


items.


Um,
 but
 it
 but
 it
 will
 it
 will
 get
 to
 a


million
 units
 and
 then
 ultimately,
 you


know,
 we'll
 do
 Optimus


4,
 that'll
 be,
 you
 know,
 10
 million


units.
 Optimus
 5
 maybe


50
 to
 100
 million
 units.
 I
 mean
 it's


really
 pretty
 nutty.
 Um


yeah.


All
 righty.
 Um
 that
 is
 unfortunately
 all


the
 time
 we
 have
 for
 Q&A
 today.
 Uh


before
 we
 conclude
 though,
 uh
 Beav
 has


some
 closing
 remarks.


>> Thanks
 Travis.
 I
 want
 to
 take
 the
 time


to
 talk
 about
 an
 extremely
 important


vote
 which
 is
 being
 held
 on
 November


6th.


The
 meeting
 will
 shape
 the
 future
 of


Tesla
 and
 we
 are
 asking
 you
 as
 our


shareholders
 to
 support
 Elon's


leadership
 through
 the
 two
 compensation


proposals
 and
 the
 reelection
 of
 Ira


Kathleen
 and
 Joe
 to
 the
 board.
 Note
 that


it
 is
 a
 team
 sport
 and
 here
 at
 Tesla
 the


board
 is
 an
 integral
 part
 of
 the
 winning


team.


shareholders
 are
 at
 the
 center
 of


everything
 we
 do
 at
 Tesla
 and
 a
 special


committee
 has
 laid
 out
 a
 compensation


package.
 Like
 Elon
 said,
 don't
 we
 don't


even
 want
 to
 call
 it
 a
 compensation


package.


>> Yes,
 it's
 not
 the
 point
 is
 that
 I
 I
 just


like
 there
 needs
 to
 be
 enough
 voting


control
 to
 give
 a
 strong
 influence,
 but


not
 not
 so
 much
 that
 I
 can't
 be
 fired
 if


I
 go
 insane.
 Um
 but
 uh
 you
 know,
 and
 I
 I


think
 that
 sort
 of
 number
 is
 in
 the


mid20s
 approximately.
 um
 as
 a
 company


that
 has
 already
 gone
 public,
 there's
 no


we've
 investigated
 every
 possible
 way
 to


how
 do
 you
 achieve
 increased
 voting


control
 without
 um
 you
 know


um


is
 there
 some
 way
 to
 have
 like
 a
 super


voting
 stock?
 But
 there
 there
 really


isn't
 is
 there
 is
 no
 way
 to
 have
 a
 super


voting
 stock
 after
 you've
 gone
 public.


Um
 but
 for
 example
 uh
 Google
 uh
 Meta


um
 you
 know
 many
 other
 companies
 have


this
 um
 but
 they
 they
 had
 it
 before
 they


went
 public
 and
 so
 it
 sort
 of
 gets
 I


guess
 grandfathered
 in.
 Um
 Tesla
 does


not
 have
 that.
 Um,
 so
 it's
 just
 like
 I


said,
 I
 just
 don't
 feel
 comfortable


building
 a
 robot
 army
 here
 and
 not
 and


then
 uh,


you
 know,
 being
 ousted
 because
 of
 some


asine
 uh,
 recommendations
 from
 ISS
 and


Glass
 Lewis
 who
 have
 no
 freaking
 clue.
 I


mean
 those
 guys
 are
 corporate
 terrorists


and
 and
 the
 problem.
 So
 let
 me
 like


explain
 like
 the
 core
 problem
 here
 is


that
 uh
 so
 many
 of
 the
 index
 funds
 um


the
 passive
 funds
 vote
 along
 the
 lines


of
 what
 whatever
 glass
 lewis
 and
 ISS


recommend.


Now
 they
 have
 made
 many
 terrible


recommendations
 in
 the
 past
 that
 if


those
 recommendations
 have
 been
 followed


would
 have
 been
 extremely
 destructive
 to


the
 future
 of
 the
 company.
 Um
 but
 if


you've
 got
 passive
 funds
 that


essentially
 def
 defer
 responsibility
 for


the
 vote
 uh
 to
 Glass
 Lewis
 and
 ISS


um
 then
 you
 can
 have
 extremely


disastrous
 consequences
 for
 a
 publicly


traded
 company
 if
 if
 too
 much
 of
 the


publicly
 traded
 company
 is
 controlled
 by


index
 funds.
 It's
 de
 facto
 controlled
 by


glass
 lewis
 and
 ISS.


This
 is
 a
 fundamental
 problem
 for


corporate
 governance


because
 they're
 not
 voting
 along
 lines


that
 are
 actually
 good
 for
 shareholders.


That's
 the
 that's
 the
 big
 issue.
 I
 mean,


that's
 what
 it
 comes
 down
 to.
 Uh
 ISS


Glass
 Lewis
 corporate
 terrorism.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 would
 say,
 you
 know,
 the


special
 committee
 did
 an
 amazing
 job
 in


constructing
 this
 plan
 for
 the
 benefit


of
 the
 shareholders.


there
 is
 no
 nothing
 which
 gets
 passed
 on


till
 the
 time
 shareholders
 make


substantial
 returns.
 So
 that's
 why
 you


know
 in
 the
 end
 I
 would
 say
 I
 would
 urge


you
 to
 not
 only
 vote
 on
 the
 plan
 but


also
 vote
 on
 all
 the
 three
 directors


because
 of
 their
 exceptional
 knowledge


and
 experience
 and
 literally
 you
 know
 we


at
 Tesla
 work
 with
 these
 directors
 day


in
 day
 out.
 I
 mean
 there
 is
 not
 even
 a


single
 day
 that
 one
 of
 the
 directors
 I


haven't
 spoken
 to
 or
 one
 of
 my
 colleague


hasn't
 spoken
 to
 and
 we're
 the
 even
 the


directors
 out
 here
 are
 not
 just
 reading


out
 of
 you
 know
 PowerPoint
 presentations


they're
 actually
 working
 with
 us
 day
 in


day
 out
 so
 again
 I
 just
 urge
 you
 guys
 as


shareholders
 to
 vote
 along
 the
 board's


recommendation
 thank
 you
 guys


>> great
 thank
 you
 VB
 uh
 we
 appreciate


everyone's
 questions
 today.
 Uh
 we
 look


forward
 to
 talking
 to
 you
 next
 quarter.


Thank
 you
 very
 much
 and
 goodbye.


>> Still
 awake
 a
 minute?


>> I
 think
 I
 yawned
 like
 five.


>> You
 yawned
 pretty
 freaking
 big.


>> Yeah,
 that
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 yawning.


>> Oh
 my
 god,
 this
 was
 freaking
 ridiculous.


>> Um


what
 do
 you
 think?
 What
 are
 your
 raw


thoughts?
 There's
 a
 couple
 things
 to
 get


into,
 but
 what
 did
 you
 take
 away
 from


them?


>> I
 I
 mean,
 look,


I
 think
 they
 should
 have
 taken
 the
 mic


away
 from
 him
 at
 certain
 points,


especially
 with
 the
 corporate
 terrorist


part.
 I
 do
 agree
 with
 him
 on
 some
 of
 the


things
 that
 he
 said.
 You
 know
 that
 I've


had
 this
 stance
 with
 index
 funds
 that
 I


don't
 believe
 Black
 Rockck,
 State


Street,
 and
 Vanguard
 should
 be
 allowed


to
 vote
 those
 shares
 because
 they're


just
 a
 custodian.
 I
 mean,
 every


>> every
 dollar
 that
 I
 have
 in
 an
 S&P
 fund,


technically
 that's
 my
 money.
 So,
 for


every
 hundred
 grand
 in
 an
 S&P
 fund,


>> if
 Tesla's
 2%
 of
 that,
 why
 is
 Vanguard


or
 Black
 Rockck
 able
 to
 vote
 those


shares
 when
 it's
 not
 technically
 their


money?
 Because
 somebody
 could
 just
 move


the
 money
 out.
 So,


he
 has
 a
 point
 there,
 but
 this
 is
 not


the
 form
 for
 that.


He
 needed
 to
 get
 the
 street
 excited
 and


the
 shareholders
 excited
 about
 FSD
 and


Optimus
 and
 he
 didn't
 do
 it.
 And
 with


where
 margins
 are
 going
 and
 with
 their


profitability
 and
 with
 credits
 coming


off,
 I
 I
 just
 think
 he
 needed
 to
 really


go
 down
 the
 hole
 about
 Optimus
 and
 he


tried
 to
 he
 did
 in
 a
 weird
 way.
 Almost


like
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


have
 enough
 production.
 Maybe
 he
 doesn't


want
 to
 build
 out
 a
 full
 army
 of
 robot.


It's
 like,
 what
 are
 you
 saying?
 Like,


this
 is
 your
 freaking
 future,
 your


company,
 and
 you're
 trying
 to
 tie
 it
 to


your
 comp
 package.
 It's
 just,
 you
 know,


I
 don't
 know.


>> What
 did
 you
 think
 about
 the
 uh
 the


sales
 pitch
 at
 the
 end
 about
 voting


in
 in
 favor?


>> I
 don't
 think
 they
 he
 even
 needed
 to
 say


anything.
 What
 people
 are
 sh
 Tesla


shareholders
 aren't
 going
 to
 vote
 for


this.


>> Yeah,
 it'd
 be
 hard
 to
 imagine
 that.


>> I
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 it's
 something
 that


need
 to
 be
 said.
 I
 think
 he
 needed
 to


focus
 on
 the
 future
 and
 talk
 about


Optimus
 and
 talk
 about
 FSD.
 I'm
 not
 an


FSD
 fan,
 but
 they
 needed
 to
 talk
 about


something
 because
 I
 I
 got
 to
 tell
 you,
 I


think
 Q4
 car
 sales
 are
 not
 going
 to
 be


good
 comparatively
 because
 you're
 not


going to
 have
 the
 regulatory
 credits.


>> Wait,
 but
 you
 don't
 think
 he
 pumped


Optimus
 enough?
 I
 mean,
 he
 did.
 He


talked
 about
 the
 dexterity
 of
 the
 hand


and
 how
 challenging
 it
 would
 be.


>> He
 said
 that
 before.
 He
 hasn't
 said
 what


their
 scale
 on
 it
 is
 going
 to
 be,
 how


many
 they're
 going
 to
 sell
 next
 year,


what
 the
 backlog
 is.
 He
 doesn't
 have
 to


say
 companies,
 but
 he
 could
 say,


"Listen,
 every
 big
 manufacturer
 or
 every


big
 company
 that
 has
 warehouses
 has


already
 contact
 us.
 They
 can't
 wait
 for


it.
 We're
 planning
 on
 getting
 to
 a


million
 robots
 by
 this
 year.
 Uh,
 not


this
 year,
 but
 you
 know what
 I
 mean
 when


I
 say
 this
 year,
 2029,
 2030.
 We're


planning
 on
 ramping
 to
 get
 production
 to


this
 level."
 and
 every
 robot's
 accounted


for
 that
 we
 produce
 like
 he
 should
 have


given
 he's
 given
 so
 much
 stuff
 about
 FSD


that
 has
 not
 come
 true
 at
 least
 provide


us
 with
 a
 road
 map
 on
 Optimus.


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 it
 is
 weird
 that
 he
 didn't


just
 say
 that
 we
 have
 major


um


warehousing
 companies,
 logistic


companies
 reaching
 out
 to
 us,
 which
 I


would
 imagine
 like
 to
 not
 lie
 about


that.
 All
 you
 have
 to
 do
 is
 have
 a


conversation
 with
 any
 one
 of
 these


companies
 and
 they're
 all
 going
 to
 pick


up
 if
 Elon
 Musk
 wants
 to
 have
 a


conversation
 and
 just
 have
 a
 simple,


hey,
 are
 you
 guys
 interested
 in
 robots?


If
 they
 say
 yes,
 boom,
 you're
 allowed
 to


say
 what
 you
 just


>> They
 don't
 have
 to
 say,
 oh,
 we're


definitely
 buying.
 They're
 just
 like,


"No,
 yeah,
 we'd
 be
 interested
 when
 you


guys
 have
 the
 robots
 ready."
 And
 then


Elon
 came
 on
 the
 earnings
 call
 and
 say,


"Dude,
 I
 just
 talked
 to
 17
 different


companies
 that
 employ
 three
 million


people
 in
 in
 in
 Brazil.
 They
 all
 want


robots,
 you
 know,
 like
 like
 and
 that
 I


think
 really
 does
 get
 the
 streets
 like,


well,
 some
 of
 the
 parts
 we
 put
 the


valuation
 from
 the
 robots
 here,
 assume


these
 operating
 margins
 and
 then
 boom,


you
 might
 get
 some
 upgrades."
 But
 he


talked
 about
 the
 hand.
 It's
 like,
 no
 one


gives
 a
 [ __ ]
 about
 the
 hand.
 No
 one


cares
 about
 the
 hand
 about
 like
 no
 one


cares.
 No
 one
 car.
 And
 so
 I
 I I
 agree


with
 you.
 Like
 there
 really
 wasn't
 a


pump
 on
 the
 idea
 of
 the
 robot


>> at
 all.


>> And
 then
 how
 about
 don't
 go
 down
 the


road
 of
 working
 is
 going
 to
 be
 optional.


Like
 come
 on.


>> Okay.
 So
 this
 stuff
 so
 he
 tweeted
 this


yesterday
 that
 no
 one
 will
 need
 a
 job


because
 AI
 will
 replace
 everything
 and


it
 will
 be
 optional.


>> Don't
 go
 down
 that
 rabbit
 hole
 right


now.
 You're
 just
 going
 to
 freak
 people


out.


>> No,
 I
 agree
 with
 you.
 It
 is
 going
 to


freak
 people
 out.
 It's
 not.
 You're
 not


relating
 to
 the
 common
 person
 by
 saying


your
 job's
 going
 to
 go
 away.
 And
 then
 C,


it's
 like,
 why
 are
 you
 saying
 that
 on


earnings
 call
 that
 old
 jobs
 are
 going
 to


be
 gone?


>> Yeah.
 It
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


earnings.
 Just
 talk
 about
 what
 these


robots
 can
 do,
 when
 you're
 going to
 get


them
 to
 market,
 and
 how
 everyone's


accounted
 for.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.


I
 agree.
 Someone
 says,
 "What
 do
 you
 mean


no
 one
 cares
 about
 the
 hand?"
 I
 mean,
 no


one
 cares
 about
 the
 hand.
 Like,
 Wall


Street
 doesn't
 give
 a
 [ __ ]
 about
 the


hand.
 They
 care
 about
 orders.
 They
 care


about
 purchase
 orders,


>> right?
 And
 look,
 dexterity
 in
 a
 hand
 is


very
 important
 for
 to
 do
 task
 of
 a


carpenter
 or
 electrician.
 You
 can
 have
 I


mean
 I
 guess
 a
 Cclamp
 style
 is
 not


necessarily
 the
 right
 thing
 but
 you


could
 have
 like
 a
 U
 style
 hand
 in
 the


beginning
 that
 can
 just
 clamp
 something


to
 move
 it
 around
 for
 a
 factory.
 You


don't
 need
 a
 perfect
 dexterity
 hand
 with


five
 fingers
 off
 the
 bat
 for
 the


remedial
 orders.


>> My
 point
 is
 like
 I
 don't
 think
 the


millions
 of
 shareholders
 that
 buy
 Tesla


care
 about
 the
 dexterity
 of
 the
 hand.


They
 just
 care
 that
 it
 works
 and
 you
 can


ship
 the
 freaking
 robot


>> and
 people
 want
 them.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 again,
 because
 it's
 not


ready
 for
 prime
 time
 yet,
 I
 to
 your


point,
 you
 have
 to
 give
 people
 the


illusion
 just
 like
 he's
 been
 doing
 for


FSD
 for
 10
 years
 that
 it's
 going
 to


eventually
 happen.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 I


got
 that
 today.
 I
 got
 more
 conversations


about
 the
 dexterity
 of
 the
 hand
 that
 I


really
 don't
 think
 people
 care
 about.


>> Yeah.
 Just
 give
 us
 a
 fiveyear
 road
 map.


You're
 allow
 He's
 allowed
 to
 be
 wrong.


give
 us
 a
 five-year
 roadmap
 on
 it.
 I


mean,
 obviously
 he's
 been
 wrong
 on
 FSD.


>> Well,
 okay.
 So,
 let's
 talk
 about
 that.
 I


mean,
 look,
 unsupervised
 is
 not
 here


yet,
 but
 he
 did
 say
 the
 litmus
 test
 for


us
 is
 that
 if
 you
 can
 text
 in
 the
 car,


then
 everyone
 will
 buy
 the
 car.
 What
 do


you
 What
 do
 you
 think
 about
 that?


>> Yeah,
 good
 luck
 with
 that.


>> I
 actually
 think
 he's
 right
 about
 this.


You're
 telling
 me
 you
 want
 to
 buy
 a


Tesla
 if
 you
 can
 text
 and
 not
 have
 to


worry
 about
 driving
 or
 get
 work
 done
 on


your
 laptop
 or
 something?


>> In
 order
 for
 me
 to
 go
 buy
 a
 Tesla,
 which


will
 happen
 at
 some
 point,
 I
 have
 to
 be


able
 to
 sleep,
 work
 on
 a
 laptop.
 It


can't
 be
 that
 every
 30
 seconds
 I
 have
 to


look
 up.
 So
 text,
 confident
 that
 you
 can


text
 while
 you're
 in
 the
 driver's
 seat.


I
 mean,
 that's
 not
 necessarily
 saying


that
 it's
 100%
 FSD
 100%
 of
 the
 time.
 So,


if
 he
 had
 made
 that
 clear
 that
 you
 could


do
 work
 on
 a
 laptop
 or
 take
 a
 nap,
 I


think
 that
 would
 have
 been
 a
 much


different
 statement.
 Maybe
 that's
 what


he
 meant
 to
 say.


>> No,
 I
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 meta
 I
 think


texting
 in
 the
 car
 is
 a
 metaphor
 for
 you


can
 do
 whatever
 the
 hell
 you
 want,
 the


car
 will
 function.
 I
 think
 that
 if
 they


do
 that
 and
 that
 gets
 passed
 and
 you
 get


through
 the
 regulatory
 hurdles,
 I
 think


it
 becomes
 the
 number
 one
 selling
 car
 in


the
 country.


>> Okay.
 So,
 so,
 so,
 so
 then
 there
 you
 go.


That's
 like
 one
 of
 the
 bright
 parts


called


>> and
 you
 know
 that
 I've
 said
 that
 from


the
 beginning
 that
 to
 me
 that's
 the


barrier
 to
 entry.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 the


that
 was
 more
 optimistic
 for
 me
 than
 the


conversation
 about
 Optimus
 because


Optimus
 conversation
 got
 very
 technical


about
 the
 hand
 and
 I
 think
 it
 it
 put


people
 to
 sleep.
 But
 when
 he
 said,
 "We


are
 confident
 that
 you
 will
 be
 able
 to


text
 in
 the
 car
 and
 not
 worry."


I
 mean,
 look,
 it's
 still
 going
 to
 be
 an


expensive
 car,
 but
 it's
 going
 to
 get
 a


lot
 more
 people
 to
 say,
 "Well,
 I
 can


justify
 it
 by
 doing
 work
 in
 the
 car
 and


etc.,
 etc."


>> Uh,
 I
 I
 just
 wish
 that
 he
 was
 a
 little


bit
 more
 clear
 on
 what
 you
 can
 do,
 not


just
 texting.
 Look,
 texting
 is
 20


seconds
 for
 a
 text,
 you
 know?
 Like,
 I


would
 have
 rather
 him
 say,
 "Listen,
 you


can
 take
 a
 nap.
 Like,
 you're
 good.
 Full


self-driving.
 We'll
 be
 here
 and
 we're


going
 to
 roll
 it
 out
 to
 this
 place,
 this


place,
 this
 place,
 and
 this
 is
 the


five-year
 road
 map
 of
 how
 we're
 going
 to


get
 it
 in
 the
 30
 largest
 cities
 and


metropolitan
 areas
 in
 the
 country."
 But


they're
 not
 giving
 us
 that
 type
 of


detail.


What
 did
 you
 think
 about
 this
 whole


we're
 going
 to
 replace
 Nvidia
 chips
 in
 a


certain
 part
 of
 the
 uh
 of
 the
 of
 the


supply
 chain
 with
 our
 partnership
 with


Samsung


kind
 of
 pseudo
 saying
 dojo's
 back.
 I
 was


kind
 of
 confused
 the
 whole
 time.
 I
 mean,


he
 kind
 of
 retraced
 on
 that
 a
 little
 bit


when
 he
 started
 talking
 about
 how
 they


can
 utilize
 both
 in
 the
 data
 centers
 and


if
 they
 have
 extra,
 they'll
 just
 throw


them
 in
 the
 data
 centers,
 but
 they're


still
 going
 to
 need
 the
 Nvidia
 chips
 and


Nvidia
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 points


that
 they
 need
 to
 hit
 with
 the
 chips


because
 all
 different
 customers
 where


Tesla
 only
 needs
 to
 worry
 about
 one


customer.
 Yeah,
 it's
 the
 same
 thing
 as


Amazon
 Alphabet.
 They're
 building
 their


own
 TPUs.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 nothing
 new.


I
 was
 just
 kind
 of
 confused
 at
 that


moment
 because
 I
 didn't
 know
 exactly


what
 he
 was
 trying
 to
 say.
 I
 think
 he


was
 trying
 to
 stress
 the
 focus
 of
 the


partnership
 with
 Samsung.
 And
 it's
 not


like
 he
 was
 trying
 to,
 you
 know,
 uh,


talk
 bad
 about
 Nvidia.
 He
 was
 just


trying
 to
 say
 that
 their
 uh,
 general


purpose
 GPU
 cannot
 solve
 the
 specific


FSD
 workload
 that
 they're
 uh,
 working


on,
 which
 is
 why
 they
 they
 signed
 that


60
 billion.


>> The
 GP
 the
 Nvidia
 GPUs
 are
 for
 training.


They're
 not
 necessarily
 for
 the
 specific


workloads
 that
 he's
 going
 to
 need
 it


for.
 So,
 yeah.
 Fine.


>> It's
 It's
 almost
 like
 he
 said,
 "We're


building
 our
 own
 custom
 ASIC."
 That's


kind
 of
 what
 I
 got
 from
 it,
 which
 is


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,
 what's
 it
 doing?


You
 have
 the
 live
 stuff
 open.
 What's
 it


doing
 right
 now?


>> 424.


>> Okay.


>> It's
 down
 3%.
 Look,
 this
 was
 not
 a


bearish
 quarter
 in
 my
 opinion
 because


this
 is
 I
 think
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 people


expected.
 Yeah,
 they
 had
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 EPS


miss,
 but
 like
 outside
 of
 that,
 like,


all right,
 Tesla's
 back
 where
 it
 was


last
 Tuesday.
 like
 that.


>> Do
 they
 give
 guidance
 for
 next
 year?


>> No.


>> I'm
 sorry,
 not
 next
 year.
 Next
 quarter?


>> I
 don't
 think
 so.


>> I
 don't
 think
 they
 ever
 give
 guidance


for
 the
 next
 quarter
 like
 that.


So,
 no,
 we
 didn't
 get
 any
 guidance.
 But


look,
 cash
 flow
 was
 better
 than


expected.


>> EPS
 was
 worse.
 Uh
 revenue
 was
 okay.
 I


mean,
 your
 point
 about
 Q4
 sucking


because
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 the


regulatory
 credit,
 I
 do
 think
 shouldn't


be
 understated.
 Like,
 even
 if
 I
 could
 be


wrong.
 Energy
 could


absolutely
 outperform
 and
 offset
 the


potential
 for
 the
 automotive
 revenue


declining,
 but
 it's
 a
 fact
 that
 the


regulatory
 credits
 for
 auto
 ended
 in


September.


Yeah.
 And
 look,
 if
 rates
 come
 down,


that'll
 be
 a
 tailwind.
 But
 I
 don't
 know


if
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 that


many
 people
 to
 buy
 the
 way
 they
 got
 them


to
 buy
 in
 Q3
 cuz
 the
 incentive
 on
 that


$7,500
 was
 like
 a
 really
 big
 reason


people
 bought.


Maybe
 the
 new
 cheaper
 models
 potentially


could
 uh
 could
 help
 as
 well,
 but


we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see.
 Uh


engineering
 Jason,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


gift
 of
 five
 memberships.
 Appreciate
 you


being
 here
 and
 thank
 you
 for
 the


memberships
 as
 well.
 Where
 where
 do
 you


think
 the
 stock
 goes,
 Steve,
 towards
 the


end
 of
 the
 year?
 I
 mean,
 do
 you
 think


tomorrow
 this
 thing
 tanks
 or
 it's
 enough


that
 he
 said
 enough?


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 think
 if
 it
 didn't
 tank


tonight,
 I
 think
 think
 it's
 going
 to


kind
 of
 go
 sideways
 from
 here
 on
 out
 for


the
 rest
 of
 the
 year.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I


wouldn't
 be
 surprised
 if
 it
 goes
 to
 500


or
 350.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 going
 past


either
 one
 of
 those
 sides.
 I
 just
 think


it's
 going
 to
 bounce
 around
 right
 now.


>> I
 think
 that's
 a
 win,
 too.
 This
 thing


was
 stuck
 at
 300%.
 This
 could
 have
 been


a
 lot
 worse.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 the
 call
 I
 think
 had
 less


Okay.
 The
 other
 part
 that
 was
 annoying


about
 the
 call
 is
 they
 didn't
 answer
 any


of
 the
 questions
 that
 mattered
 from


retail
 investors.


>> No.


>> Right.
 Like
 like
 they're
 like,
 "Oh,


first
 of
 all,
 why
 would
 you
 say
 publicly


to
 millions
 of
 investors,
 we
 are
 going


to
 skip
 over
 the
 next
 question
 because


it's
 about
 future
 products.
 You
 don't


have
 to
 say
 that.
 Just
 don't
 say


anything.
 Just
 move
 on
 to
 the
 next


question."
 Like
 it
 was
 so
 weird
 like


okay
 you
 guys
 get
 to
 answer
 what
 this
 is


your
 call.
 You're
 not
 legally
 obliged
 to


answer
 any
 question.
 Most
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 companies
 that
 don't
 take
 any


questions
 at
 all
 from
 shareholders


institutional.
 So
 the
 fact
 that
 they


announced
 hey
 this
 is
 a
 future
 product


update.
 We're
 not
 going
 to
 answer
 this


is
 just
 like
 a
 slap
 in
 the
 face
 versus


just
 move
 on.
 Don't
 even
 don't
 even


acknowledge
 it.


So,
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 just
 weird
 and
 a


a
 bit
 cringe
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 why


they're
 even
 acting
 like
 that,


especially
 because
 the
 shareholder


meeting
 is
 coming
 up
 so
 soon,
 right?


It's
 like
 not
 previewing
 it
 doesn't
 make


sense.
 Yeah,
 the
 skips
 were
 all


important
 questions.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 say


technologies,
 all
 the
 skips
 were
 the


[ __ ]
 that
 people
 actually
 cared
 about.


Here's
 the
 problem.


If
 Q4
 comes
 in


and
 it's
 not
 better
 than
 Q3
 when
 you're


in
 the
 holiday
 season,
 that's
 going
 to


be
 a
 problem
 for
 Tesla.
 Like
 they
 need


Q4
 to
 be
 larger
 revenue.


>> What
 was
 Hold
 on.
 What
 was
 Tesla
 Q4


2024?


>> It
 was
 less
 than
 Q3.
 It
 was
 495,000


cars


and
 11
 gawatts
 of
 energy.
 So,
 they've


got
 to
 beat
 and
 and
 look
 what
 happened.


And
 look
 what
 happened
 before


the
 whole
 tariff
 war.
 Look
 at
 a
 one-year


chart
 of
 Tesla.
 Look
 what
 happened
 after


they
 reported
 through
 through
 the
 end
 of


January,
 beginning
 of
 February.
 It
 fell


off
 a
 cliff.


Uh
 Oh,
 yeah.
 That
 was
 480
 down
 to


freaking
 270.
 Yeah.


>> And
 that's
 before
 all
 the
 tariff
 stuff.


It's
 because
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 Q4
 was


weaker
 than
 expected.
 It
 was
 weaker
 than


Q3.
 You
 didn't
 get
 the
 holiday
 bump
 in


sales.


I
 mean,


and
 when
 I
 say
 total
 revenue,
 I'm


talking
 about
 the
 auto
 revenue.
 Energy


helped
 the
 total
 revenue
 just
 squeak
 out


a
 couple
 hundred
 million
 more
 on
 total,


but
 vehicle
 revenue
 declined
 quarter


over
 quarter
 in
 Q4
 2024.


>> And
 I'm
 worried
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 that


again.


>> Yeah,
 that
 is
 uh
 that
 is
 something


definitely
 to
 watch
 out
 for
 Q4.
 Maybe


Ray
 Cuts,
 can
 someone
 help?
 I
 love
 how


people
 say
 that
 we
 don't
 understand


Tesla.
 Love
 it.
 Like
 guys,
 they
 do
 $7


billion
 in
 free
 cash
 flow.
 Like
 if
 they


extrapulate
 that
 out
 based
 on
 this


quarter,


okay,
 they'll
 do
 16
 billion
 over
 the


next
 12
 months.
 That's
 a
 speckle
 for
 a


company
 that's
 valued
 at
 $1.3
 trillion.


Like
 they
 have
 to
 get
 FSD
 and
 Optimus
 to


market
 immediately.


I
 I
 also
 think
 it's
 silly
 because


everyone
 knows
 that
 Tesla's
 more
 than
 a


car
 company
 and
 everyone
 knows
 that


Tesla
 trades
 at
 an
 incredible
 premium


against
 the
 market
 against
 things
 like


Nvidia
 even
 though
 they're
 not
 growing


and
 everyone's
 willing
 to
 say
 that
 Tesla


deser
 because
 every
 because
 I
 think
 at


least
 you
 and
 I
 believe
 in
 Elon
 we


believe
 in
 his
 vision.
 We
 believe
 that


eventually


>> believe
 in
 the
 future.
 that,
 you
 know,


>> so
 like
 no
 one's
 saying
 that
 the
 stock


deserves
 to
 go
 to
 $200,
 but
 it's
 not
 a


good
 quarter
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 actual


numbers.
 And
 the
 question
 then
 becomes,


if
 this
 was
 not
 a
 good
 quarter,
 what


happens
 to
 Q4?


And


>> I
 mean,
 we
 forgot
 about
 the
 diner.
 Maybe


they
 can
 sell
 burgers.


>> Maybe
 the
 burgers
 help
 out.


>> I
 mean,
 if
 they
 open
 one
 near
 me,
 I'll


go
 there.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 There's
 no
 point
 to
 be
 ideological


about
 it.
 I
 mean,
 Tesla's
 a
 phenomenal


company.
 Elon's
 a
 phenomenal
 leader,
 but


like
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 they're
 not


in
 the
 position
 of
 growth
 that
 they
 were


in
 2019.
 And
 that's
 okay,
 but
 you
 have


to
 call
 a
 spade
 a
 spade
 and
 acknowledge


it.


>> Yeah.
 Remember


>> the
 fact
 that
 they're
 holding
 a
 one
 and


a
 half
 trillion
 dollar
 market
 gap
 and


not
 growing.
 I
 mean,
 like
 people
 need
 to


be
 grateful
 for
 what
 the
 stock
 trades


at.


>> And
 look,
 everybody
 needs
 to
 remember


Elon
 has
 done
 something
 nobody
 else


would
 have
 been
 able
 to
 do.
 And
 I
 don't


make
 definitive
 statements.
 Nobody
 else


could
 have
 went
 up
 against
 the
 auto


companies
 and
 won.
 He
 did.
 Okay.
 And
 he


did
 it
 with
 an
 electric
 vehicle.
 So,
 got


to
 give
 him
 a
 ton
 of
 credit.
 The
 guy's


accomplished
 more
 than
 almost
 anybody


ever.
 And
 it's
 not
 a
 knock
 on
 Tesla.


It's
 just
 for
 the
 future
 of
 Tesla
 to
 be


bright,
 what
 all
 the
 shareholders
 want


it
 to
 be,
 you
 need
 to
 see
 a
 five-year


plan
 on
 Optimus,
 and
 they
 need
 to


deliver
 on
 it.
 and
 they
 need
 to
 deliver


FSD
 to
 market
 in
 the
 major
 metropolitan


areas.
 If
 they
 don't
 do
 that,
 it's
 going


to
 be
 difficult
 for
 them
 to
 get
 to
 two,


five,
 and
 10
 trillion
 market
 cap.
 And
 I


don't
 think
 there's
 anything


unreasonable
 with
 that
 statement.


>> If
 anyone
 thinks
 what
 you
 said
 is


unreasonable,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think


they're
 in
 a
 fairy
 tale
 around
 this


company.
 Like
 this
 is
 a
 one
 and a
 half


trillion
 dollar
 company
 that's
 not


growing
 that's
 trading
 at
 200
 times
 free


cash
 flow
 because
 of
 how
 much
 people


love
 and
 believe
 in
 the
 vision.
 Like
 the


fact
 that
 people
 are
 willing
 to
 give
 it


that
 premium
 on
 no
 growth
 just
 means


that
 you
 you
 kind
 of
 sit
 back
 and
 and


let
 the
 story
 play
 out
 which
 is
 I
 think


how
 most
 Tesla
 investors
 think
 of
 it.


But
 you
 also
 have
 to
 be
 honest
 with


yourself
 and
 say
 okay
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


touch
 it.
 It's
 just
 going
 to
 sit
 in
 that


corner
 in
 the
 next
 10
 years.
 Hopefully


it's
 bigger.
 But
 in
 the
 short
 term,


there
 are
 some
 headwinds
 that
 it's


dealing
 with.


>> Yeah,
 it
 would
 it
 would
 have
 been
 nice


also
 if
 along
 the
 way
 Tesla
 was
 a


holding
 company
 of
 SpaceX
 and
 of
 XAI
 and


Neurolink


or
 at least
 was
 a
 seeding


capital
 or
 or
 seed
 investor
 in
 the


capital
 rounds.
 Like
 the
 fact
 that
 Tesla


doesn't
 have
 that
 on
 the
 balance
 sheet


is
 weird.


>> That's
 always
 been
 weird.
 I
 don't


understand
 why
 Tesla's
 not
 a
 holding


company
 for
 a
 bunch
 of
 Elon's
 other


businesses.
 I
 really
 don't
 get
 it.
 I
 I


genuinely
 think
 it's
 because
 he
 never


had
 full
 control
 over
 Tesla.
 So,
 he


never
 wanted
 if
 he
 got
 kicked
 off
 some


random
 schmuck
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get


ownership
 over
 SpaceX,
 right?


>> Could
 you
 imagine
 if
 it
 was
 a
 holding


company
 for
 those
 companies?
 It
 would
 be


more
 talked
 about
 than
 Birkshshire
 as
 a


holding
 company
 at
 that
 point.
 Dude,
 if


Tesla
 owned,
 let's
 call
 it
 10%
 of
 each


of
 his
 startups.


>> I'd
 say
 a
 little
 more
 to
 for
 what
 I
 just


said
 to
 happen,
 but
 yes,
 I'm
 with
 you.


>> 20%
 of
 SpaceX.


>> 20
 25%
 of
 SpaceX
 boring
 Neuralink
 and


freaking
 XAI.


>> Bro,
 Google
 owns
 more
 SpaceX
 than
 Tesla,


>> which
 is
 crazy.


>> That
 is
 actually
 crazy.


>> Come
 on.


That
 is
 wild.


>> Look,
 I
 want
 Look,
 I
 want
 Tesla
 to
 do


well.
 I
 want
 everybody
 to
 do
 well
 on


this
 and
 I
 want
 Tesla
 to
 succeed
 because


if
 Tesla
 succeeds,
 that
 means
 the
 US


succeeds
 and
 Americans
 succeed.
 I
 just


think
 that
 they
 need
 to
 bring
 these
 two


main
 drivers
 of
 future
 revenue
 to
 market


quicker.
 It
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 there
 is
 a


real
 plan
 to
 get
 nationwide
 FSD
 out


there
 anytime
 soon.


Look,
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 agree
 with


that,
 but
 the
 reason
 I
 do
 agree
 is


because
 these
 new
 cheaper
 models,
 I


thought
 the
 goal
 was
 get
 them
 super


cheap,
 get
 people
 hooked
 onto
 FSD
 and


scale.
 That's
 not
 Dude,


>> most
 people
 that
 buy
 a
 Tesla
 don't
 even


know
 it
 can
 drive
 itself.


like


>> 22
 to
 $24,000
 models
 and
 then
 they
 were


going
 to
 pay
 a
 couple
 hundred
 bucks
 a


month
 for
 FSD.


That's
 what
 I
 thought
 the
 idea
 was.


>> Like
 if
 the
 car
 costs
 you
 $35,000
 to


make
 and
 you
 sell
 it
 for
 $25,000
 and
 you


lose
 $10,000
 on
 the
 car,
 but
 FSD
 is


whatever
 a
 couple
 hundred
 a
 month
 or


8,000
 10,000
 full
 over
 the
 lifetime
 of


the
 the
 the
 services
 that
 you
 can


provide.
 you
 will
 make
 up
 that
 money
 at


scale
 and
 you
 will
 and
 then
 when
 when


when
 when when
 someone
 flips
 on
 their


car
 to
 be
 a
 robo
 taxi
 then
 it
 really


makes
 up
 that
 money
 as
 billions
 and


billions
 of
 miles
 are
 driven
 across
 the


world
 in
 the
 robo
 taxi
 network
 but
 you


need
 tens
 of
 millions
 of
 cars
 Uber
 has


that
 because
 you
 know
 Uber
 has
 millions


and
 millions
 of
 drivers
 on
 the
 network


Tesla
 doesn't
 have
 that
 yet
 and
 I
 feel


like
 I
 think
 that
 is
 the
 vision
 for


robots
 also
 this
 whole
 idea
 that
 you


know
 there's
 7
 million
 Teslas
 on
 the


road
 not
 everyone's
 going
 to
 flip
 the
 on


button
 on
 uh
 the
 robo
 taxi.


>> Not
 everyone's
 gonna
 do
 that.
 Like
 I


kind
 of
 want
 to
 keep
 my
 car
 to
 myself.
 I


don't
 want
 some
 random


>> I
 go
 buy
 a
 Tesla.
 Nobody's
 getting
 in
 it


that
 I
 don't
 know.


>> Period.


>> There's
 a
 people
 dismissed
 that
 point,


but
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 like


the
 privacy
 of
 owning
 their
 own.


>> A
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 are
 not
 going
 to


let
 their
 personal
 vehicle
 go
 out
 and


drive
 people
 around.


>> Yes.


So
 then
 you
 need
 as
 many
 vehicles
 as


possible
 on
 the
 road,
 which
 means
 you


need
 the
 car
 to
 get
 cheap
 enough
 for


people
 to
 buy
 it.
 And
 and
 these
 new


models
 are
 not
 cheap.
 And
 I
 was
 very


surprised
 two
 weeks
 ago
 when
 I
 saw
 the


prices
 for
 that.
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 how
 is


this
 supposed
 to
 give
 us
 an
 uptick
 in


volume
 at
 all?


>> I
 don't
 know.


>> Also,
 personal
 vehicles
 have
 a


exclusion
 for
 livery
 on
 insurance.
 Yeah.


Well,
 the
 insurance
 debate.
 Don't
 get


Steve
 started
 on
 the
 insurance
 debate.


That
 is


>> Oh,
 I'll
 go
 down
 the
 rabbit
 hole
 if
 you


want
 for
 two
 minutes.


>> That's
 a
 whole
 another
 question
 on


insurance.


>> Yeah,
 we
 look
 the
 the
 very
 short
 answer.


>> Hold
 on.
 Hold
 on.
 People
 saying
 get
 Fars


in
 here
 to
 debate
 Ste.
 No,
 Steve
 is
 not


some
 of
 the
 Tesla
 investors
 need
 to
 stop


being
 so
 unbelievably
 emotional.
 You're


acting
 like
 Steve
 is
 saying
 this
 stock


deserves
 to
 go
 to
 $50.
 Like
 there's
 no


debate
 that
 needs
 to
 be
 had.
 What
 are
 we


talking
 about
 debate?
 Acting
 like
 Steve


hasn't
 analyzed
 this
 company
 for
 the


past
 five
 years.
 You
 think
 you
 think
 he


doesn't
 understand
 the
 way
 this


operates?
 He
 might
 have
 a
 different


perspective
 than
 Farszod,


but
 this
 is
 not
 some
 Tesla
 bull,
 Tesla


bear.
 Like,
 people
 try
 to
 make
 it
 so


competitive
 on
 this
 stock.
 And
 it's


like,
 can't
 we
 just
 talk
 about
 the


numbers?
 What's
 happening?


>> You
 know what's
 crazy?
 You
 guys
 could


freaking


go
 on
 X
 and
 freaking
 blow
 up
 Elon
 and


tag
 me
 and
 it
 and
 I'll
 say
 the
 same
 [ __ ]


to
 Elon
 directly.
 Like,
 I'm
 not
 changing


my
 viewpoint.
 It's
 an
 amazing
 company


and
 no
 other
 car
 company
 has
 been
 able


to
 do
 what
 it's
 done
 and
 no
 other
 person


has
 been
 able
 to
 achieve
 what
 Elon's


achieved.
 But
 in
 order
 for
 the
 market


cap
 to
 continue
 to
 grow,
 you
 need
 these


future
 products
 to
 start
 hitting
 the


market.
 Like
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 people


can't
 see
 that


the
 car
 market's
 not
 gonna
 get
 any


easier
 for
 them.


>> Also,
 Farzad
 thinks
 Uber
 is
 going
 to


zero.
 So
 you
 you
 have
 like
 you
 have


vastly
 different
 perspectives
 on
 this.
 I


don't
 think
 Uber
 is
 going
 to
 zero
 and


neither
 does
 Steve.
 Farzod
 has
 he's
 been


on
 my
 channel
 multiple
 times
 and
 he
 said


Uber
 is
 going
 to
 zero.
 So
 when
 you're


talking
 about
 having
 a
 debate,
 you
 have


two
 people
 with
 totally
 different


perspectives
 that
 don't
 necessarily
 need


to
 debate
 because
 there's
 not
 a
 debate


about
 this.
 It's
 just
 a
 different
 angle.


>> I'm
 not
 like
 I'm
 not
 bearish
 Tesla.
 Like


I'm
 neutral
 Tesla.
 I
 don't
 know
 why.


Like
 the
 the
 whole
 definition
 of
 neutral


Tesla
 is
 it
 goes
 sideways.
 Like
 that's


neutral.
 Like
 I'm
 not
 saying
 it's
 going


down.
 Like
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 people
 can't


understand
 this.


>> Yeah.
 Also,
 if
 you
 can't
 objectively


analyze
 your
 investment,
 I
 mean,
 like


what's
 the
 point
 of
 being
 an
 investor
 at


that
 point?
 Like,
 I've
 criticized


Palenter.
 I've
 criticized
 Hood.
 Like,


it's
 like
 you're
 supposed
 to
 be
 able
 to


critique
 your
 investments
 if
 they
 have


not
 the
 best
 quarter,
 not
 the
 I
 mean,


dude,
 if
 Robin
 Hood
 was
 going
 negative


30%
 year-over-year,
 they
 would
 not
 be


trading
 at
 these
 levels.
 If
 Paler
 was


going
 a
 negative
 30%
 yet,
 Tesla's
 going


a
 negative
 30%
 and
 is
 holding
 the
 types


of
 multiples
 they're
 holding.
 That
 is
 a


blessing
 for
 this
 stock.
 And
 that's
 just


facts.
 That's
 not
 political.
 That's
 not


disrespectful.
 That's
 not
 biased.
 That


is
 just
 a
 fact.
 For
 a
 stock
 to
 be


trading
 at
 these
 multiples,
 showing
 zero


growth,
 and
 going
 into
 a
 Q4
 where
 they


don't
 have
 a
 tailwind
 of
 a
 EV
 regulatory


credit,
 like
 objectively,
 it
 is
 pretty


damn
 amazing
 that
 it's
 trading
 at
 these


levels.
 That's
 okay
 to
 understand.


>> And
 keep
 in
 mind,
 and
 and
 Amit
 will
 tell


you
 if
 I'm
 lying
 or
 not.
 I've
 said
 in


the
 past
 multiple
 times,
 when
 Optimus
 is


available
 for
 public,
 I'm
 buying
 one.


When
 a
 Tesla
 can
 drive
 me
 around
 and
 I


can
 go
 to
 sleep,
 I'm
 buying
 one.
 Have
 I


not
 said
 that
 multiple
 times?


>> Like,
 I'm
 even
 saying
 I'm
 going
 to
 buy


the
 product.
 Like,
 I
 want
 these
 products


to
 come
 out.


Yeah.
 Look,
 I
 I
 am
 invested
 in
 two


private
 robot
 companies.
 I
 really


believe
 in
 the
 humanoid
 robotic
 thesis.


I've
 been
 talking
 about
 it
 for
 a
 year


>> and
 so
 does
 Steve.


>> Robotics
 is
 the
 future.


>> It's
 just
 not
 here
 yet.
 That's
 all.
 It's


just
 not
 here
 yet.


>> And
 that's
 okay.
 But
 like
 like
 that's


just
 being
 honest.
 No
 one's
 saying
 we


don't
 believe
 in
 it.
 Well,
 in
 fact,


we're
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 Elon


could
 have
 framed
 the
 message
 around


Optimus
 to
 get
 people
 more
 excited


without
 lying
 about
 it.
 And
 that's
 not


what
 we
 heard
 from
 him,
 you
 know,
 which


is


>> no,
 we
 heard
 him
 more
 concerned
 about


his
 comp
 package,
 which
 is
 not


necessarily
 what
 you
 want
 to
 hear
 a
 CEO


say


because
 he's
 almost
 holding
 it
 hostage


at
 that
 point
 because
 if
 he
 doesn't
 get


the
 comp
 package,
 then
 what's
 his


incentive?
 Like
 is
 he
 going
 to
 leave,


you
 know,
 like
 it's
 just
 I
 don't
 know.


>> He
 could
 have
 communicated
 a
 lot
 better.


I
 do
 think
 he
 was
 afraid
 that
 he
 I
 think


he
 knows
 he'll
 definitely
 get
 the
 votes,


but
 I
 do
 think
 he's
 afraid
 there
 is
 an


off
 chance
 he
 doesn't.
 And
 if
 he


doesn't,
 what
 does
 he
 do,
 right?
 Because


then
 he's
 just
 like
 he's
 not
 leaving
 in


my
 opinion,
 but
 you
 would
 probably
 be


pretty
 I
 mean
 just
 bought
 a
 billion


dollars
 worth
 of
 Tesla
 stock.
 He
 doesn't


want
 to
 leave,
 right?
 But


>> yeah,
 but
 a
 billion
 would


>> not
 necessarily
 a
 huge
 amount
 of
 money,


>> but
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 he
 actually
 spent
 a


billion
 or
 if
 he
 borrowed
 against


something
 else
 to


>> exactly


>> buy.
 So
 it's
 it's
 you
 know,
 he's
 got
 to


retain
 his
 ownership


>> and
 then
 look,
 if
 he
 doesn't
 if
 he


doesn't
 get
 the
 comp
 package
 and
 he


stays,
 does
 he
 slow
 roll
 Optimus
 then?


because


>> yeah
 I
 think
 his
 incentives
 would
 be


severely
 dampened
 if
 he
 doesn't
 get
 the


compensation
 package
 which
 is
 why
 he


needs
 the
 also
 the
 comp
 package
 again
 I


know
 people
 have
 different
 perspectives


but
 if
 he's
 going
 to
 get
 a
 trillion
 and


you're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 10x
 and
 maybe
 you


put
 200
 grand
 into
 Tesla
 you
 will
 get


two
 million
 okay
 you
 won't
 have
 a


trillion
 but
 you
 will
 have
 two
 million


you
 will
 still
 relative


>> what
 Rob
 said
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 build
 a


robot
 army
 if
 I
 don't
 have
 control
 so


comp
 package
 or
 no
 optimist
 He's


basically
 he
 said
 that
 on
 the
 call.
 We


all
 heard
 it.


>> He
 did
 spend
 a
 decent
 amount
 of
 time


talking
 about
 the
 robot
 army.
 That
 is


correct.


>> So,


I'm
 neutral.
 I
 want
 Tesla
 to
 succeed.
 I


want
 these
 products
 to
 come
 out.
 I'm
 a


buyer
 of
 the
 products
 when
 they
 do
 come


out.
 I
 just
 wish
 that
 we
 got
 a
 five-year


timeline
 on
 Optimus
 and
 I
 wish
 that
 we


got
 more
 clarity
 around
 when
 they
 think


that
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 in
 at least
 the


10
 largest
 metropolitans
 areas
 in
 the
 US


for
 FSD.


>> Yeah.
 And
 here's
 the
 thing.
 So
 Sunnil


says
 no
 one
 is
 talking
 about
 how
 good


crazy
 good
 V14
 is.
 So
 first
 of
 all,
 I'm


going
 to
 try
 V14
 because
 Elon
 said


anyone
 can
 download
 it.
 So
 I'm
 going
 to


go
 to
 my
 test
 and
 see
 if
 I
 can
 download


it.
 But
 number
 two,
 I
 think
 that's
 the


problem.
 No
 one's
 talking
 about
 it


because
 there's
 not
 distribution
 for


V14.


Like,
 first
 of
 all,
 it's
 not


unsupervised,
 which
 would
 really
 ramp
 up


the
 distribution
 as
 Elon
 said.
 Number


two,
 they
 don't
 have
 enough
 volume
 of


vehicles
 because
 the
 cars
 are
 still


relatively
 expensive.
 Uh,
 and
 the


cheaper
 models
 aren't
 making
 it
 less


expensive.
 So,
 you're
 not
 getting
 people


every
 day
 downloading
 FSD.
 So
 until
 they


figure
 out
 the
 distribution
 aspect


either
 through
 robo
 taxi
 and
 expansions


as
 as
 Steve
 was
 saying
 or
 straight
 up


Elon
 comes
 out
 and
 says
 unsupervised
 is


here
 you
 can
 text
 in
 the
 car
 here's
 the


pre-order
 to
 buy
 the
 car
 like
 you
 know


like
 until
 that
 moment
 happens
 who
 cares


how
 good
 V14
 is


like
 it
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 make
 a


tangible
 difference
 on
 the
 growth
 of
 the


company
 until
 unsupervised
 happens
 and


on
 unsuper
 provides
 the
 precursor
 for


distribution
 of
 robo
 taxi
 across
 the


world.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 there's
 still
 a


regulatory
 hurdle
 for
 that,
 right?
 Like


the
 idea
 that
 you
 can
 just
 text
 in
 your


car
 and
 have
 like
 that
 still
 has
 to
 be


approved
 by
 the
 government
 that
 people


in
 this
 vehicle
 using
 this
 software
 are


allowed
 to
 not
 have
 their
 eyes
 on
 the


road
 because
 right
 now
 it
 is
 a
 crime.
 If


you
 if
 you
 I
 got
 pulled
 over
 like
 a


couple
 months
 ago
 because
 I
 was
 checking


my
 phone


>> and
 it
 was
 it
 was
 checking
 it
 for
 like


two
 seconds
 but
 I
 you
 know
 the
 cop


happened
 to
 be
 there
 and
 I
 was
 like
 I


got
 pulled
 over
 right
 like
 still
 a


crime.
 You
 also
 need
 insurance
 carriers


to
 put
 an
 exclusion
 on
 the
 policy
 to


allow
 that
 because
 if
 they
 don't
 and
 you


are
 using
 FSD
 and
 you
 get
 into
 an


accident


and
 it's
 let's
 just
 say
 you
 get
 into
 an


accident
 and
 it's
 not
 your
 fault
 because


somebody
 rear
 ends
 you
 but
 your
 policy


doesn't
 have
 doesn't
 allow
 you
 to
 use


FSD,
 you're
 likely
 to
 be
 at
 fault.


So
 yeah,
 keep
 keep
 in
 mind
 that
 you


still
 need
 the
 insurance
 companies
 to


sign
 on
 to
 this


>> and
 that
 that's


>> maybe
 so
 what
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 to


follow
 up
 with
 that
 is
 on
 the
 insurance


side
 and
 I
 actually
 do
 know
 what
 I'm


talking
 about
 on
 the
 insurance
 side.
 So


if
 the
 major
 companies
 don't
 allow
 it,


that'll
 create
 a
 void
 for
 somebody
 to


step
 in
 and
 take
 a
 winner
 or
 take
 most


approach.
 So,
 there
 will
 be
 an
 insurance


company
 that
 allows
 it,
 okay?
 So,
 don't


get
 me
 wrong,
 at
 some
 point
 there
 will


because
 if
 State
 Farm
 and
 Liberty
 and


all
 the
 big
 ones
 don't,
 you'll
 see


somebody
 else
 because
 they'll
 be able
 to


make
 money
 on
 it.
 You'll
 still
 have
 to


make
 switch
 your
 insurance
 and
 make
 sure


that
 your
 insurance
 policy
 allows
 it.


Otherwise,
 you're
 really
 not
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 use
 it
 because
 if
 something
 goes


wrong,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 covered.


So,
 keep
 that
 in
 mind
 also.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 and
 as
 you're
 saying,


because
 there
 will
 be
 a
 gap
 in
 the


market,
 it
 will
 be
 solved.
 It's
 just


that
 is
 also
 down
 the
 line.
 That's
 not


happening
 tomorrow.
 And
 if
 that
 doesn't


happen
 anytime
 soon,
 like
 like
 why


should
 the
 stock
 have
 some
 greater


premium
 breakd?


It's
 I
 don't
 know.
 And
 look,
 dude,
 it
 is


a
 real
 thing.
 Like
 I
 I
 thankfully
 just


got
 a
 ticket
 and
 had
 to
 pay
 50
 bucks.
 I


didn't
 get
 any
 points
 on
 my
 license
 or


anything,
 but
 like
 what
 Elon
 was
 saying


was
 a
 big
 deal.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 want
 to


check
 their
 phone
 when
 they're
 driving,


especially
 people
 that
 have
 to
 work
 or


get
 to
 send
 a
 message
 or
 something
 and


un unfort


you
 get
 pulled
 over.
 It's
 like
 if
 they


find
 you,
 they
 and
 and
 they're
 looking


for
 in
 New
 Jersey
 in
 particular,
 they


have
 various
 laws
 about
 how
 serious
 it


is
 to
 not
 check
 your
 phone
 when
 you're


driving.
 And
 the
 cops,
 you
 know,
 the


cops
 don't
 mess
 around
 with
 that.
 So


that's
 why
 I
 agree
 with
 Elon.
 would
 be
 a


massive
 motivator
 for
 people
 to
 buy
 a


Tesla
 if
 they
 could
 have
 the
 software


that
 requires
 them
 to
 not
 worry
 about


it.
 But
 it
 feels
 like
 that's
 not


happening
 next
 year.
 And
 if
 it
 does,


that's


>> a
 lot
 of
 people
 spend
 40
 minutes
 to
 an


hour
 driving
 each
 way
 to
 work.
 If
 you


have
 FSD,
 that's
 a
 big
 motivator


to
 get
 a
 Tesla.
 You
 can
 get
 an
 extra


hour
 of
 sleep
 in
 the
 morning.
 You
 can


get
 work
 done
 on
 the
 way
 home.
 I
 mean,


that
 would
 be
 a
 motivator
 for
 me
 to
 go


buy
 a
 Tesla.


>> I
 think
 it
 would
 be
 motivators
 for
 a
 lot


of
 people.
 No,
 there
 was
 no
 other


passengers
 in
 the
 car.
 It
 was
 just
 me.


It
 was
 just
 driving.
 I
 was
 only
 going
 to


the
 grocery
 store,
 bro.
 This
 was
 like


back
 in
 May.
 And,
 you
 know,
 the
 cop
 just


happened
 to
 be
 there.
 But
 I
 I
 I
 usually


I I
 mean,
 I've
 got
 him
 pulled
 over
 maybe


one
 other
 time
 in
 my
 life,
 so
 he
 let
 me


go
 because
 I
 have
 a
 pretty
 good
 record.


But
 it
 is
 annoying,
 right?
 Because
 like


you
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 just
 navigate
 it


without
 dealing
 with
 it.
 He
 also
 then


was
 going
 to
 give
 me
 another
 ticket


because
 he
 was
 like,
 "You
 need
 to
 have
 a


license
 plate
 on
 the
 front
 of
 your


Tesla."
 I
 was
 like, "What?"
 Like,
 "They


don't
 even
 send
 us
 two
 light."
 He's


like, "You
 have
 to
 like
 So,
 I've
 never


put
 a
 license
 plate
 on
 the
 front."


>> No,
 you
 have
 to
 have
 two
 license
 plates


in
 New
 York.
 Not
 every
 state
 needs
 them.


>> Apparently,


>> on
 Teslas,
 you
 don't,
 but
 in
 New
 Jersey,


you
 do,
 but
 I've
 never
 been
 pulled
 over


because
 I


>> So
 then
 why
 is
 Tesla
 excluded?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know.
 Ask
 Rock
 Ask


Rock
 if
 Tesla's
 excluded
 from
 New
 Jersey


driving
 laws.


>> It's
 probably
 not,
 but
 like
 I've
 never


been
 pulled
 over
 ever
 because
 I
 don't


have
 But
 he
 said
 it
 that
 day
 and
 I
 was


like
 seriously,
 do
 I
 actually
 need
 to?


But


the
 point
 is
 if
 we
 could
 have
 FSD
 that's


unsupervised,
 it
 changes
 everything.
 It


sends
 the
 stock
 to
 the
 moon
 because
 I


think
 it
 changes
 so
 much
 of
 the
 dynamics


of
 the
 ecosystem,
 the
 volume,
 the


deliveries.
 But
 we're
 just
 not
 at
 that


level
 yet.


>> Until
 we're
 there,
 then
 I
 don't
 know.


>> FSD
 will
 be
 huge.
 And
 it's
 not
 for
 the


robo
 taxi
 thing.
 There's
 too
 many
 flaws


with
 the
 robo
 taxi
 thing.
 It's
 because


people
 will
 truly
 utilize
 FSD
 and
 buy
 a


Tesla
 over
 a
 different
 vehicle
 because


of
 FSD.


>> Yeah,
 I
 know.
 So,
 Lemonade
 said
 the


other
 day
 they
 would
 handle
 all
 the


Tesla
 insurance.
 Perfect.
 Elon


>> Elon
 didn't
 respond
 to
 that.
 But
 you
 did


have
 one
 insurance
 company
 come
 out
 and


said
 we
 would
 take
 all
 the
 liability,


which
 is
 kind


>> There
 you
 go.
 So
 then
 it's
 all
 good.


You'll
 have
 coverage.
 You
 just
 got
 to
 go


to
 Lemonade
 for
 the
 car.


>> Well,
 Elon's
 also
 got
 to
 agree
 that


Lemonade
 should
 be
 their
 provider.
 He


has
 not
 done
 that
 yet.
 But


>> there
 are
 going to
 be
 other
 ones
 as
 you


said.


>> Does
 Elon
 have
 to
 have
 a
 say
 in
 it?
 I


mean,
 if
 Lemonade
 is
 going
 to
 allow
 the


liability
 on
 their
 policy,
 that's
 not
 an


Elon
 decision.
 All
 they're
 saying
 is
 if


you
 get
 into
 an
 accident
 with
 FSD,
 we're


going
 to
 cover
 the
 claim
 and
 the


liability.


>> If
 they
 want
 if
 they
 want
 a
 like
 go
 to


market
 partnership
 with
 Tesla
 that


>> that's
 different.
 Partnership
 is


different.


>> Yeah,


>> that's
 absolutely
 different.


You
 just
 need
 a
 insurance
 company
 to
 say


that
 they
 will
 cover
 it.
 That's
 all
 you


need.
 And
 if
 Lemonade
 saying
 that
 they


will
 cover
 it,
 great.


So,
 what
 other
 growth
 vertical
 next
 year


do
 you
 think
 Tesla
 has
 that
 can
 actually


make
 the
 stock
 move
 higher?
 Because
 it's


not
 energy
 unless
 they
 like
 really
 ramp


that
 up.


>> Subsidies
 are
 gone
 on
 energy
 too
 at
 the


end
 of
 this
 year


>> and
 the
 the
 the
 the
 battery
 packs.
 I


mean,
 they're
 already
 growing
 it
 at


100%.
 If
 they
 grow
 it
 at
 another
 100%,


okay,
 cool.
 But
 that's
 not
 like
 changing


the
 dynamics
 of
 the
 the
 valuation
 on
 the


stock.
 So
 then
 it
 comes
 down
 to


deliveries
 on
 the
 vehicles
 which
 I
 know


rates
 are
 coming
 down
 but
 again
 like


what
 is
 being
 real
 by
 Tesla.
 So
 then
 the


only
 thing
 that's
 left
 is


FSD
 and
 Optimus


and
 if
 it's
 not
 Optimus
 which


again
 he
 didn't
 really
 give
 us
 any


guidance
 that
 2026
 we
 would
 see
 some


meaningful
 deliveries
 in
 Optimus
 then
 it


has
 to
 be
 FSD.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 that
 the


best
 shot
 for
 them
 to
 have
 a
 real


breakthrough
 next
 year
 is
 FSD
 gets
 very


close
 to
 unsupervised
 or
 full-on


unsupervised.


But
 if
 it's
 not
 at
 these
 now,
 if
 Tesla


was
 250
 today,
 it'
 be
 a
 different
 story.


But
 Tesla
 at
 420
 is
 more
 so
 like
 all


right.
 So
 there's
 a
 lot
 baked
 into
 this


valuation
 at
 this
 point.


>> There's
 a
 lot
 baked
 in.
 I'm
 looking
 for


what
 the
 C
 where's
 the
 just
 give
 me
 one


sec.
 So


energy


Someone
 has
 a
 question
 right
 here.
 Let


me
 just
 ask
 this
 question.
 Someone
 says,


"Should
 I
 dump
 my
 Tesla
 that
 I
 bought
 at


$45
 since
 2017


and
 buy
 Pounder
 Hood
 or
 Amazon?"
 So,
 I


love
 the
 chat.
 Answer
 that
 one.
 I
 mean,


look,
 here's
 my
 take
 and
 I
 said
 this


when
 Jeremy
 was
 was
 selling
 his
 Teslas.


Well,
 his
 average
 was
 at
 13
 bucks.
 I


would
 not
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


I
 think
 you
 have
 such
 a
 high
 margin
 of


safety.
 I
 don't
 think
 Tesla's
 ever
 going


back
 to
 45.
 I
 really
 doubt
 it
 ever
 goes


back
 into
 the
 low
 200s
 that
 I
 think
 it's


a
 lottery
 ticket
 now
 and
 you
 just
 hold


on
 to
 it
 forever.


So
 I
 would
 not
 sell
 Tesla
 if
 you
 were


sitting
 at
 an
 average
 under
 a
 100red.
 I


mean
 at
 that
 point
 now
 I
 get
 it.
 People


think
 well
 the
 stock
 might
 underperform.


But
 like
 you
 you
 sitting
 on
 a
 10x


basically
 so
 even
 if
 it
 goes
 down
 it's


like
 all
 right
 well
 you're
 sitting
 on
 it


and
 Elon
 is
 now
 incentivized
 to
 take
 its


10
 trillion.


So,
 I
 personally,
 if
 I
 had
 that
 average,


I
 wouldn't
 take
 profits
 here.
 But
 I
 can


understand
 thinking,
 hey,
 what
 if


there's
 other
 opportunities
 that
 are


actually
 growing
 and
 and
 that's
 a
 fair


point.
 It's
 just
 then,
 you
 know,
 as
 as


as
 much
 as
 we're
 talking
 about
 the
 lack


of
 potential
 actual
 growth
 in
 Tesla,
 the


the
 the
 the
 the
 potential
 of
 the
 stories


and
 the
 stories
 ability
 to
 manifest
 in


growth,
 even
 if
 it's
 not
 in
 27
 or
 28,


but
 2030,
 2035,
 that
 is
 more
 exciting


than
 pretty
 much
 every
 company
 in
 the


market
 outside
 of
 maybe
 Nvidia,
 right?


like
 there's
 not
 that
 many
 other


companies
 that
 have
 a
 story
 and
 a


narrative
 that
 is
 so
 vast


to
 get
 you,
 you
 know,
 those
 50%
 growth


rates.
 Again,
 like
 Tesla,


>> I
 just
 ran
 the
 numbers
 real
 quick.
 Um,


energy
 did
 over
 a
 billion
 in
 gross


profit
 this
 quarter.
 So,
 that's
 great.


Services,
 366
 million
 gross
 profit.


That's
 good.
 Energy
 is
 great.
 But
 once


again,
 without
 these
 subsidies,
 I
 don't


know.
 I
 think
 the


Most
 of
 the
 business
 is
 going
 to
 come


from
 the
 big
 battery
 packs
 for
 data


centers.
 I
 don't
 think
 many
 people
 are


going
 to
 be
 buying
 solar
 panels
 for


their
 houses
 and
 spending
 30,
 40,
 50


grand
 on
 a
 system
 without
 the
 subsidies.


>> No
 way.
 That's
 why
 Nphase
 has
 been


cooked.
 This
 is
 all
 this
 is
 a
 data


center
 play
 now,
 which
 is
 exciting


because
 the
 data
 centers
 have
 a
 ton
 of


demand.
 So,
 you
 know,
 why
 should


freaking
 Bloom
 Energy
 or
 Oaklo
 be


getting
 all
 this
 multiple?
 Why
 isn't


that
 baked
 into
 Tesla?


So
 it's
 just
 it's
 just
 how
 much
 is
 it's


already
 1.4
 trill
 like
 how
 much
 is
 there


a
 how
 much
 growth
 could
 you
 bake
 into


the
 the
 energy
 part
 of
 the
 business
 to


help
 the
 valuation?
 I
 don't
 know
 because


you
 if
 you
 assume
 that


sorry
 I
 had
 to
 turn
 my
 ringer
 on
 because


I
 have
 some
 work
 stuff
 going
 on
 but
 um


if
 you
 assume
 that


they're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 data


center
 buildout
 except
 from
 XAI
 I
 mean
 I


don't
 know


right
 now
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 revenue
 is


still
 coming
 from
 automobiles
 yes
 it
 has


transitioned
 a
 little
 bit,
 but
 it's
 even


more
 important
 that
 we
 see
 services


explode
 and
 you
 don't
 get
 that
 without


FSD.
 It's
 even
 more
 important
 that
 you


add
 another
 vertical,
 you
 don't
 get
 that


without
 Optimus.
 So,
 the
 answer
 to
 your


question
 is
 without
 Optimus
 and
 without


FSD,
 there
 are
 no
 other
 verticals
 for


them
 to
 go
 into


>> because
 you're
 pretty
 much
 tapped
 at


your
 growth
 rate
 with
 energy
 right
 now.


>> Yeah.
 And
 again,
 let's
 assume
 they


double
 the
 energy
 growth
 rate.
 Like
 that


that
 doesn't
 make
 a
 meaningful


difference
 for
 the
 bottom
 line.
 So
 it's


FSD
 or
 bus
 next
 year
 because
 it's
 not


Optimus
 unless
 Elon
 really
 I
 mean
 the


fact
 that
 they
 said
 the
 production
 line


is
 starting
 in
 2026
 means
 there's
 no
 way


it
 could
 be
 Optimus.
 They
 will
 hopefully


start
 producing
 Optimus,
 but
 they
 will


not
 be
 selling
 Optimus
 because
 first
 of


all,
 well,
 you
 need
 to
 produce
 it
 before


you
 can
 sell
 it.
 Second
 of
 all,
 the
 AI


and
 the
 bot
 needs
 to
 be
 good
 enough
 to


sell
 it.
 There
 is
 no
 evidence
 that
 the


AI
 in
 the
 bot
 is
 anywhat
 good.
 Every


video
 we've
 seen
 has
 been
 a
 dancing


video.
 Nothing's
 been
 anything


meaningful,
 right?
 So,
 I
 think
 Optimus


is
 a
 wash
 for
 26.
 I
 agree.
 Which
 means


it's
 FSD
 or
 bust
 next
 year
 in
 terms
 of


really
 changing
 the
 narrative
 on
 stock


appreciation.


And
 maybe,
 you
 know,
 I'll
 try
 FSD14.


Maybe
 it's
 closer
 to
 unsupervised
 than


we
 think.
 But
 if
 it
 doesn't
 get
 to


unsupervised,


the
 incentive
 isn't
 that
 strong.


I
 don't
 know.
 We'll
 see.
 I
 I
 think
 Q4
 is


going
 to
 be
 interesting.


So,


I
 just
 wish
 he
 went
 about
 the
 earnings


call
 a
 little
 bit
 differently.


>> Did
 you
 uh
 did
 you
 buy
 anything
 today
 on


the
 dip?


>> Yes.
 Did
 you
 buy


>> I
 bought
 more
 energy
 transfer?


>> ET.


>> Yeah.
 ET
 phone
 home,
 right?


He
 is
 a
 nice
 little
 divvy
 stock.


Okay,
 ET.
 There
 you
 go.


All
 right,
 folks.
 I
 think
 that's
 it
 for


us.
 Uh
 Steve,
 are
 you
 going
 to
 go
 live


later
 tonight?


>> Probably
 later,
 like
 9:30
 for
 a
 little


bit.
 We'll
 see.


>> Okay,
 so
 I'm
 going
 to
 link
 Steve's


channel
 right
 here
 on
 my
 channel.
 If
 you


don't
 subscribe
 to
 him,
 you
 can


subscribe
 to
 him
 here.
 Um,
 look,
 overall


it
 was
 a
 decent
 quarter.
 I
 think
 for


everyone
 who
 said
 the
 stock
 likely
 is


not
 going
 to
 go
 to
 the
 moon
 or
 not
 going


to
 go
 to
 the
 graveyard.
 I
 mean,
 yeah,


it's
 down
 3
 4%
 whatever.
 It
 was
 at
 this


level
 last
 week,
 so
 we
 didn't
 see
 too


much
 change
 in
 that.
 Um,
 earnings
 call


was
 fine.
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 was


necessarily
 horrible.
 I
 just
 think
 you


didn't
 get
 a
 ton
 of
 optimistic


predictions
 on
 robots
 for
 next
 year,


but
 you
 did
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 optimism
 around


unsupervised
 FSD.
 So,
 I
 think
 that's
 the


thing
 that
 everyone
 will
 be
 waiting
 for


going
 into
 next
 year.


All
 right,
 there
 you
 go.
 Thank
 you


everybody.
 Appreciate
 it.
 We
 uh
 have


officially
 started
 Big
 Tech
 earnings
 and


hopefully
 Stephen
 and
 I
 can
 do
 a
 bunch


more
 of
 these
 throughout
 the
 rest
 of
 the


next
 couple
 weeks
 and
 we'll
 keep
 going


from
 there.


>> All
 right,
 that's
 it.
 Thank
 you.


>> See
 everybody
 later.


>> See
 you
 guys
 tomorrow
 morning.
 Bye


everyone.
