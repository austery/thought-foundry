The
 dream.
 Build
 a
 livable,
 affordable,


eco-friendly
 community.
 California


Forever
 owns
 more
 than
 100
 square
 miles


of
 land
 here
 in
 Solano
 County,
 backed
 by


Silicon
 Valley
 investors
 to
 build
 a
 new


city.


>> We're
 going
 back
 to
 what
 the
 Bay
 Area


and
 Northern
 California
 used
 to
 do
 back


in
 the
 60s
 and
 70s
 and
 80s
 when
 it
 was


the
 center
 for
 high-tech
 manufacturing


in
 America.


>> This
 new
 city
 will
 be
 entirely


self-funded
 and
 sustainable.
 The


innovation
 engine
 that
 we
 have
 in


Northern
 California
 is
 really
 special


and
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 are
 throttling
 it


by
 not
 building
 up
 housing
 is
 just


crazy.


Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 please
 welcome


California
 Forever's
 Yan
 Stramic.


Morning.


As
 you've
 just
 heard,
 I
 run
 California


Forever,
 which
 is
 building
 the
 next


great
 American
 city.
 And
 we
 are
 building


it
 right
 here
 in
 California.
 And
 I
 know


what
 all
 of
 you
 are
 already
 thinking,


which
 is
 uh
 California.
 Really?
 Well,
 uh


where
 are
 we
 today?
 We
 are
 in


California.
 The
 Allen
 Summit
 is
 in


California.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 kind
 of


the
 point
 because
 despite
 all
 of
 its


flaws
 and
 challenges,


California
 is
 irreplaceable.


Whether
 you
 like
 it
 or
 not,
 there
 is


nowhere
 else
 in
 America
 that
 can
 play


the
 role
 that
 California
 plays
 uh
 in
 the


United
 States
 right
 now.
 And
 so
 we
 have


to
 fight
 for
 fixing
 all
 of
 the
 things


that
 are
 wrong
 with
 the
 state.


[Music]


I
 was
 born
 in
 Eastern
 Europe
 in
 1987
 in


the
 Czech
 Republic.
 Uh
 which
 was
 two


years
 before
 the
 wall
 came
 down.
 And
 uh


growing
 up
 as
 a
 kid
 in
 posts
 Soviet


Eastern
 Europe,
 um
 California
 was
 the


California
 dream.
 California
 was
 this.


And
 then
 after
 26
 years,
 I
 finally
 got


here
 in
 2013.
 And
 what
 I
 found
 was


this.


It
 was
 homelessness.
 It
 was
 people


throwing
 rocks
 at
 Google
 buses.


It
 was
 companies
 beginning
 to
 leave
 the


state.
 And
 and
 all
 of
 it
 was
 entirely


self-inflicted.
 All
 of
 it.
 This
 was
 a


self
 goal.
 100%
 of
 it.
 Because
 we
 had


failed
 to
 build
 enough
 of
 everything


that
 you
 need
 to
 run
 an
 actual
 state.
 We


failed
 to
 build
 enough
 housing.


We
 failed
 to
 build
 enough
 office
 space.


We
 failed
 to
 build
 enough
 factories.
 We


failed
 to
 build
 enough
 freeways
 and


trains
 and
 energy.
 All
 of
 it.
 And
 uh
 I


found
 that
 profoundly
 sad
 because
 to
 me,


California
 and
 more
 broadly
 America,
 we


we
 were
 defined
 by
 building
 to
 the
 rest


of
 the
 world.
 I
 mean,
 we
 were
 the
 place


that
 could
 build
 better
 than
 anyone
 else


in
 the
 world.
 The
 Golden
 Gate
 Bridge
 was


built
 in
 four
 years.
 The
 Boeing
 747
 went


from
 an
 idea
 to
 carrying
 a
 fair
 paying


passenger
 in
 three
 years.


The
 Navy
 got
 the
 idea
 to
 build
 a
 nuclear


submarine
 in
 1951.
 It
 was
 in
 the
 water


in
 1954


and
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 really
 sad.
 Now


here's
 the
 good
 news.
 It
 took
 a
 while


but
 in
 the
 last
 few
 years
 uh
 both
 on
 the


left
 and
 on
 the
 right
 we
 have
 realized


that
 this
 question
 of
 how
 do
 we
 build
 in


America
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 defining


question
 of
 um
 the
 next
 20
 years
 and


that
 brings
 me
 to
 this.
 Shortly
 after


coming
 to
 California
 about
 a
 decade
 ago,


I
 started
 working
 on
 what
 became


California
 forever.
 And
 we
 wanted
 to


build
 a
 place
 where
 California
 would


build
 at
 a
 scale
 that
 is
 worthy
 of
 this


great
 state.
 And
 we
 are
 doing
 that
 in
 a


place
 called
 Solano
 County,
 which
 is


about
 halfway
 between
 Silicon
 Valley
 and


Sacramento.


Very
 importantly,
 it's
 also
 about
 half


an
 hour
 east
 of
 Napa.
 Over
 the
 decade,


we've
 raised
 over
 a
 billion
 dollars
 and


we've
 acquired
 nearly
 70,000
 acres
 to


build.
 That's
 over
 a
 100
 square
 miles.


This
 is
 what
 it
 looks
 like.


It
 is
 this
 incredible
 canvas
 for


California
 to
 build.
 Again,
 it
 is
 five


times
 the
 size
 of
 the
 island
 of


Manhattan.
 The
 land
 we
 own
 is
 two
 and
 a


half
 times
 the
 size
 of
 the
 city
 of
 San


Francisco.
 It
 is
 where
 the
 Sacramento


Bay
 meets
 the
 Sacramento
 River.
 And
 what


we
 going
 to
 build
 there
 are
 all
 of
 the


things
 that
 California
 and
 America
 need


right
 now.
 And
 we're
 going
 to
 start
 by


actually
 going
 back
 to
 what
 built


Silicon
 Valley.
 Uh
 we're
 going
 to
 start


by
 building
 the
 Solano
 Foundry
 which


will
 be
 the
 largest
 advanced


manufacturing
 park
 in
 America.
 Um
 where


Silicon
 Valley
 can
 once
 again
 colloccate


R&D
 and
 um
 and
 production.
 There's
 been


a
 lot
 of
 talk
 about
 China
 here
 today
 and


on
 shoring
 manufacturing.
 We
 cannot


compete
 with
 China
 and
 onshore


manufacturing


by
 throwing
 bodies
 at
 the
 problem.
 We


simply
 don't
 have
 enough
 people
 in


America
 to
 do
 that.
 The
 only
 way
 that
 we


can
 compete
 is
 by
 building
 factories
 of


the
 future
 where
 we
 use
 robotics
 and
 AI


to
 dramatically
 increase
 the


productivity
 per
 worker.
 That
 also
 makes


the
 job
 more
 fun.
 That
 also
 allows
 those


companies
 to
 pay
 those
 people
 way
 better


to
 work
 in
 those
 factories.


Who
 are
 the
 people
 who
 can
 build
 the


factories
 of
 the
 future?
 Who
 are
 the


people
 who
 do
 robotics
 and
 AI?
 Where
 do


they
 live?
 They
 predominantly
 live
 in


the
 Bay
 Area.
 And
 right
 now
 we
 are


making
 it
 insanely
 hard
 for
 them
 to
 do


their
 job
 by
 forcing
 them
 every
 time


they
 need
 to
 go
 to
 the
 factory
 floor
 to


get
 on
 a
 plane
 in
 Silicon
 Valley
 and
 fly


to
 some
 other
 part
 of
 America
 and
 then


adjust
 it
 and
 then
 spend
 3
 days
 coming


back.
 You
 cannot
 do
 a
 one-day
 trip
 to


Texas
 or
 Ohio.
 It's
 a
 3-day
 trip.
 We


should
 have
 places
 where
 Silicon
 Valley


can
 build
 an
 hour
 outside
 of
 Manuel


Park.
 And
 that's
 what
 we're
 building


with
 the
 foundry.
 The
 second
 major


national
 security
 issue
 that
 we're


working
 on
 is
 ship
 building.
 As
 you


might
 have
 heard,
 we
 have
 quite
 a


serious
 problem,
 Houston.
 Just
 as
 one


example,
 Jong
 Jing
 Island
 shipyard
 in


China
 built
 more
 ships
 last
 year
 than
 we


have
 built
 collectively
 in
 the
 United


States
 since
 the
 end
 of
 the
 Second
 World


War.
 One
 shipyard.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 every


ship
 in
 China
 that
 is
 a
 commercial
 ship


is
 built
 to
 military
 standards.
 so
 that


if
 you
 need
 to
 in
 a
 conflict
 scenario,


you
 can
 mount
 it
 with
 guns
 and
 systems


and
 everything
 else
 that
 you
 need.
 We


have
 a
 long
 way
 to
 go.
 Here
 is
 the
 good


news.
 Jong
 Jing
 Island,
 the
 Death
 Star


of
 Chinese
 ship
 building,
 is
 the
 area


that
 you
 can
 see
 in
 red
 on
 this
 image.


Newport
 News,
 which
 is
 the
 biggest


shipyard
 we
 have
 in
 America,
 um
 is
 shown


in
 blue.
 And
 then
 the
 next
 few
 shipyards


are
 the
 next
 shipyards
 where
 we
 build


submarines
 and
 other
 programs.


The
 good
 news
 is
 that
 they
 all
 fit
 on


the
 6
 and
 a
 half
 miles
 of
 waterfront


that
 we
 own
 in
 Solano
 County
 on
 the
 deep


water
 ship
 channel.
 All
 of
 them.
 And


that
 is
 less
 than
 10%
 of
 the
 holding


that
 we
 have
 overall
 in
 the
 area.
 So


this
 shipyard
 has
 the
 scale
 to
 really


move
 the
 needle
 for
 the
 country.


But
 it's
 not
 just
 that.
 This
 is
 a
 map
 of


all
 of
 the
 shipyards
 in
 the
 United


States,
 public
 and
 private.
 And
 what
 you


can
 see
 is
 that
 most
 of
 them
 are
 huddled


around
 on
 the
 eastern
 seabboard
 and
 in


the
 Gulf.
 I
 hate
 to
 break
 it
 to
 you,
 but


the
 enemy
 is
 that
 way.
 If
 you're
 the


Chinese
 Communist
 Party,
 the
 first
 thing


that
 you'll
 do
 in
 any
 kind
 of
 conflict


in
 the
 Pacific
 is
 you
 will
 bomb
 or


otherwise
 shut
 down
 the
 Panama
 Canal.


And
 if
 you've
 done
 that,
 there
 is
 no
 way


to
 bring
 our
 ships
 back
 into
 the
 United


States
 into
 the
 shipyards
 for
 repair.


And
 there
 is
 no
 way
 to
 bring
 new
 ships


out
 into
 the
 conflict
 without
 going


around
 Argentina,
 which
 is
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 miles
 away.
 So
 we


desperately
 need
 new
 shipyards.
 We


desperately
 need
 them
 in
 on
 the
 West


Coast.
 And
 the
 good
 news
 is
 that
 the


best
 and
 the
 biggest
 site
 in
 America
 for


ship
 building,
 for
 new
 shipyards,


happens
 to
 be
 located
 in
 the
 Bay
 Area,


which
 is
 number
 one,
 the
 best
 natural


harbor
 in
 the
 country.
 And
 number
 two,


where
 all
 of
 the
 AI
 talent
 is
 that
 you


need
 to
 build
 the
 ships
 of
 the
 future
 in


the
 shipyard
 of
 the
 future.


Lastly,
 you
 can't
 just
 build
 a
 shipyard


and
 a
 manufacturing
 park.
 You
 need
 to


build
 a
 whole
 city
 to
 support
 them.
 And


to
 do
 that,
 we
 building
 a
 new
 walkable


city
 for
 up
 to
 400,000
 people.
 Um,
 but


unlike
 the
 shipyard
 and
 the
 foundry,


which
 are
 about
 technologies
 of
 the


future
 and
 of
 the
 21st
 century,
 the
 city


is
 inspired
 by
 old
 American


neighborhoods,
 by
 places
 like
 Charleston


and
 the
 West
 Village
 and
 Marina
 in
 San


Francisco
 where
 you
 have
 traditional,


beautiful
 architecture.
 Your


80-year-olds
 can
 walk
 to
 school
 alone


and
 um
 you
 can
 have
 dinner
 with
 friends


in
 a
 in
 a
 public
 square.
 Uh
 it's
 the


kind
 of
 place
 that
 so
 many
 so
 many


Americans
 and
 Californians
 want
 to
 live


in,
 but
 right
 now
 they
 either
 can't


afford
 it
 or
 they
 even
 can't
 find
 it
 at


all.
 And
 so
 in
 summary,


there
 is
 this
 incredible
 energy
 whether


it's
 the
 re-industrialized
 movement,


whether
 it
 is
 um
 the
 abundance
 movement,


people
 who
 say
 let's
 it's
 time
 to
 build


and
 all
 of
 them
 are
 calling
 on
 America


to
 meet
 the
 moment.
 And
 in
 the
 past
 eras


whenever
 that
 happened,
 we
 had
 symbols


that
 were
 built
 in
 those
 eras.
 The


Guilded
 Age
 had
 the
 transcontinental


railroad
 and
 the
 rebuilding
 of
 Chicago.


The
 New
 Deal
 had
 the
 Hoover
 Dam.
 Uh


during
 the
 war,
 we
 built
 ships
 in
 Kaiser


shipyards
 with
 Rosie
 the
 Riveter
 and
 the


space
 age
 put
 a
 man
 on
 the
 moon.
 And
 our


proposition
 is
 that
 because
 of
 its
 scale


and
 its
 location
 and
 ambition,


California
 Forever
 is
 a
 physical


manifestation
 of
 all
 of
 the
 most


important
 things
 in
 America
 right
 now.


this
 new
 optimism,
 manufacturing,
 ship


building,
 homes
 for
 everyone,
 speed
 and


abundance.
 And
 that's
 why
 this
 matters


for
 Solano
 County.
 That's
 why
 this


matters
 for
 California.
 That's
 why
 this


matters
 for
 America
 because
 all
 of
 these


places


need
 a
 new
 shining
 city
 on
 a
 hill
 and


that's
 what
 we
 are
 building.
 Thank
 you


very
 much.
