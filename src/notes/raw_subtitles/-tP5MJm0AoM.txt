What does building climate
resilience look like?
Anabela Bonada is managing
director of climate science at
the Intact Centre on Climate
Adaptation, based at the
University of Waterloo.
She says Canada shouldn't just
respond to disasters, it should
also prepare for them to.
Welcome to our program.
Anabela. How are you?
>> Good. How are you?
>> I'm doing well. All right.
We're here to talk about
climate adaptation. What is it?
>> Excellent question. So it's
very different from mitigation.
We hear a lot about mitigation
in the media for maybe the last
30 years. It's been more
mainstream for us as Canadians
and in the world. When we talk
about adaptation and climate
change, we're looking at
preparing our homes, our
communities, changing our
behaviour to adapt to the
climbing, the changing climate.
So with changing climate, we're
seeing more wildfire, more
flooding occur, extreme heat.
So we have these like long
seasons of extreme heat in
Canada now that we didn't have
before. So we are looking for
ways to really adapt our lives
so that we can live in these
changing conditions. And that's
really what adaptation is.
>> When did climate adaptation
enter the Canadian lexicon?
When did we start thinking
about this?
>> That's really good because
really we've known about
adaptation for many years.
So again, it's kind of grew up
with mitigation, but nobody
paid much attention to it
because it felt like we were
giving up on climate if we
talked about adaptation.
But over the last ten years,
there's been a real shift in
Canada. So the impacts from
climate have only gone up.
We've seen it in financially,
we've seen it in loss of lives.
So adaptation has really
entered the conversation.
And I would say it's become
mainstream in the last five
years really. But part of the
conversation for the last ten.
>> I want to pick up on a point
you just made. If we are
focusing on the adaptation part,
are we sort of giving up on the
mitigation part?
>> No, never. And we would
never ask for that to happen.
Both need to happen together.
And that's what we're hearing
more from people across Canada
that do this kind of work.
We need to combine the two and
not see them as separate.
If we only mitigate and we
don't prepare our communities
for the impacts, we're going to
continue to feel them and have
losses that we just don't want
to have. The impacts will
continue to be felt from
climate change, even if we were
to completely reduce our
emissions today, just from how
long it will take for for the
climate to go back to normal.
>> When did adaptation become
an official strategy here in
Canada?
>> 2023. So I do have a.
>> Fairly recent.
>> Super recent. Yeah, we're
still kind of learning our way
through it. The federal
government released their
National Adaptation Strategy
in 2023, with 26 targets for
Canadians to learn about
extreme weather and to learn
what to do as communities and
at the household level to
reduce their risk. So we're
still implementing those
strategies across the country.
There's a lot of work being
done on it, but it's super new
for us.
>> I want to get into some real
world examples. You are an
expert in wildfires, so I think
let's start with that. If we
were to look at adaptation,
what does it look like
in the terms of wildfires?
>> There are different levels
of adaptation for wildfires. So
we can start at the home level.
Let's do it. Yeah. There's so
much that people can do.
And I kind of love that about
wildfire, about adaptation.
Everyone can do it. So if you
have some time this weekend,
we're almost in the off season
wildfire seasons ending.
>> End of October.
>> Yeah, exactly. This is a
perfect time right before
winter to go and look at your
yard, clean up your yard.
If there's any dry debris,
remove it.
Make sure there's nothing
under your deck or around your
home. The 1.5 perimeter around
the home is really important to
keep as clear as possible.
If you have mulching, consider
changing that to soil to
changing it to rocks, and like
that will really prevent your
home from burning or being in
danger. Most homes burn from
embers, so even if a wildfire
is not occurring close to your
community, the embers can land
in those spaces and ignite the
home. So just think about that,
clearing some of the vegetation
and reducing some of the
build-up farther away from the
home. So even if you have some
big beautiful trees, just try
to maintain them as healthy as
possible. Remove branches up to
two metres and that way the
fire has nowhere to go.
You're just cutting those areas
so the fire can't travel.
So lots for homeowners to do.
And I really encourage them to
to look into that
and do as much as possible.
>> All right. So let's go from
homeowners. Let's go bigger.
What else can we do when it
comes to forest fires.
Whether it's businesses
or municipalities.
>> Yeah. And there's so much
that needs to be done. And
everybody needs to participate
to reduce risk. So businesses,
municipalities they need to
think about those bigger
projects. So where is our
infrastructure. Is it close to
forested areas. Then we need to
create firebreaks around those
areas. We also need to make
sure we have enough
firefighting water for example.
So some of the fires that
occurred in 2023, there just
wasn't enough fire, sorry,
enough water to fight those
fires off. So making sure
that's always up to par, that's
considered adaptation and
preparedness. Making sure that
people are aware of their risk
and providing educational
resources. That's considered
preparedness as well.
That doesn't cost municipalities
or businesses anything to do.
And then some of the bigger
things are how we design
our communities. So if we're
thinking of expanding
communities and housing in
Canada, which is a big
conversation right now, where
are we going to build those
homes? And if they're close to
that wildland urban interface
where wildfires happen, let's
clear some of the vegetation.
Let's make sure that the homes
are wildfire resilient before
we build them.
>> I do have a question. When
you talk about the homeowners
and businesses, what we learned
during Covid is that we a lot
of people used Nature Forests
as sort of a third space.
I myself love planting.
I've got a beautiful garden that
I like to tend to.
It might be hard for a lot of
people who are listening
to be like, oh, you know,
no mulch, none of that
stuff near my house. How do you
try to convince people that
perhaps it's not the easiest
because they might have a hard
time with that as well?
>> It's such a good point.
A lot of people hear what we say
and they say, oh, so I have to
remove my vegetation or cut
down my trees. We would never
say that because that wouldn't
even be good for your home,
for the environment.
We have pollinator gardens.
There's so much that we care
about outside of
just the wildfire risk.
So first, are you at risk of
wildfire? And if you are, and
you should know from what we've
seen in the past five years,
happen in Canada, or just speak
to your municipality, then you
should start to implement some
of these actions.
Now, with that being said, there
are incredibly beautiful gardens
that are fire resistant, fire
resilient. Fire Smart BC has
an incredible list of plants
that are fire resistant.
The other day in an email,
I got that hostas.
They're pretty common, like.
>> Big flower.
>> Yeah, people love them.
They're fire resistant.
I didn't know this.
>> Okay.
>> I'm not a big gardener.
Okay, so for gardeners, there
are tons of beautiful plants
that they can plant close to
the home and just maintain them.
Keep them moisturised. You want
to make sure that they're wet.
If your plants dry out, you're
creating a hazard for your home.
So maintaining a good garden is
actually perfect for for fire
resilience.
>> You talked about water
keeping your plants wet.
I want to talk about flooding.
Now from a homeowner's
perspective, what can we do
when it when we talk about
adapting to flooding?
>> Yeah, there's again tons
that homeowners can do that
residents can do.
So look around your home.
What what do you have
if you have a basement?
Think about your valuables, for
example. That's the first easy
thing that you can do. Put them
higher up. So even if you have
to have them in the basement,
think of some shelving units or
having containers that are a
bit water resistant for your
valuables. So in case that your
basement floods, you can
protect it. So you're looking
at like about 30 centimetres
to keep things raised.
You can have a sump pump
which not every home can have,
but if you can, that's excellent
for taking the water out.
But outside their
home there's a lot that can be
done. So like take a walk
around your neighbourhood and
you'll see that with the leaves
that are falling now in the
fall, our drains get covered
and some of the cleaning might
take time to do so.
Just clearing those drains will
help the water just drain when
it comes down. Looking at your
eavestroughs making sure that
they're clear as well.
You don't want to have leaves
in them so that water can flow
through. And the last one
that's pretty easy is extending
downspouts. So I love to take
walks around the neighbourhood
and kind of look at what people
have going on. Some downspouts
are going right into the
foundation, so just think about
extending it by a couple of
metres into the drain, the
street drain. And you're
already doing so much to
protect your home.
>> What can the city do?
>> There's a lot that cities
can do and they're working
super hard. I do want to
commend a few cities in Canada
that have dealt with a lot of
flooding over the past few
years. We have older
infrastructure in some cities,
so our water systems are
combined. The water. When those
systems were built, climate
change wasn't in mind. So they
were built to sustain rain
events that are from the past,
not what we have now. So bigger
infrastructure projects are
upgrading our water systems,
which I've seen a lot this
summer. We know summer is
construction season in Canada,
and I've just seen those
streets being ripped up and
people might be getting upset
about not having, like, their
streets open.
>> But there's a reason.
>> Exactly. An excellent reason.
Next time it rains, your roads
won't be flooded. At the
smaller scale, municipalities
can hand out information on
what homeowners can do to
protect themselves from
flooding. And the biggest one,
and the one we were talking
about, you know, during Covid,
people like to be outside and
enjoy nature, maintaining
nature, bringing back nature.
So our wetlands are incredible
at stopping rain, at cleaning
the water too, and really
slowing it down so that
flooding doesn't occur.
So things think about the
wetlands in your communities.
Let's not build over wetlands.
Let's maintain them.
They're doing a lot of work
for us.
>> Does Canada focus enough on
climate adaptation and
resilience?
>> Not too much. I think we're
getting there. So because the
strategy just came out in 2023,
it's it's slow to be
implemented. We do have more
funding going towards
adaptation, but currently the
numbers are looking at like if
we have $24 for mitigation, we
have $1 for adaptation. So it's
very, very lopsided at this
time. But we are seeing more
and more funding go towards it.
More of the conversations going
towards protection and
preparedness, which is what
adaptation is. So we're getting
there, but we're still a bit
far from from being in the
ideal place.
>> We're talking about the
money. Let's talk about the
responsibility. Whose
responsibility should it be,
or is it to fund fund it?
>> Yeah. It's everyone's. And
that's a terrible answer I know,
but this is a whole of society
approach. So if we don't all do
something, homeowners,
businesses, all levels of
government, we're not going to
do anything. When it comes to
climate change mitigation or
adaptation funding wise.
If we do really want to look at
someone, I would say a lot of
the funding does come from the
federal government that goes
towards the provinces, but
municipalities are at the
forefront of climate change.
They're feeling the impacts
and they are the least funded
when it comes to levels of
government and when people's
basement floods, they kind of
just say it's the government's
fault. Without thinking which
level of government. So more
support to municipalities is
exactly what we need in order
to bring these projects around.
>> We talked about wildfires
and flooding and sort of the
breakdown of the
responsibilities of homeowners
and businesses and
municipalities. On the other
end, how much of climate
adaptation should be from
government, how much should be
from the individual?
>> It's like a 5050.
So individuals have a lot that
they can do themselves.
And when flooding occurs, when a
wildfire occurs, it's you who's
losing. Even if you have ways
to regain some of the loss,
some of the materials can't be
replaced. If a home is burned,
you'll hear the stories.
They're absolutely devastating.
People can't replace what
they've lost. So a lot of that
responsibility falls on you.
But government has a huge voice
in Canada. So if they were to
create education programs to
really raise the awareness of
Canadians, I've spoken to a lot
of people this past summer, and
they didn't fully understand
their risk level because
wildfire was happening in new
places this summer that we
haven't seen before. So it felt
maybe sorry, momentary, like it
might not occur again.
So a big education program,
the government's in the ideal
position to make that happen
for Canadians so that they can
understand and also provide
that funding in order to do
the projects.
>> Well, you say, you know,
particularly over the last
couple of years, a lot of
people who are weren't prepared
for fires or floods that
historically have never
occurred there. But do you
think people are prepared to
take on that responsibility?
Some. It can be a lot to ask.
>> Yeah, and it's a lot to ask.
But it's also so we have other
numbers. For example, for every
dollar that we invest in
adaptation, we have 2 to 10 of
a return on investment over ten
years. So even though we're
asking a lot from people and
some of it is free to do, like
cleaning out your eavestroughs,
you will see a return on it.
And it's hard to see because if
a flood doesn't occur right now,
you're like, why am I doing
this? But if it were to occur,
speak to the people that have
gone through it. We have lots
of stories from people that
have experienced flooding.
They know and they have invested
to make their homes flood
resilient, but also they know
what the mental strain is.
So it's very difficult once
you've gone through an extreme
event like wildfire, like
flooding, to recover from that,
the next time that you hear
there's a fire near my home
again, what that feels and the
mental strain on people, I don't
think we're asking too much
if it means peace of mind
and ownership over reducing
your risk.
>> You talk about the emotional
toll. There's a lot of anxiety
around climate change just in
general. Do you think this
framework of adaptation and
resilience can help combat,
or how can we combat that?
>> Absolutely, because it gives
you something you can do right
now to protect yourself, to
protect your loved ones, your
neighbours. So when we talk
about adaptation, you know, we
focus on the big on the three
big ones. So wildfire, flooding
and extreme heat. If we talk
about extreme heat, what it
does is make people sick and
it can kill people. This puts
something in your hands that
you can do. Just checking, for
example, on the elderly, on
your neighbours. It means that
you can really reduce that risk
and save someone's life.
If that doesn't reduce some of
your climate anxiety, you know,
I don't know what will because
this is giving you something
to do that is proven to save
people's lives.
>> Anabela I really appreciate
it. Thank you so much. I think
the one takeaway for me at
least the, the, the most, the
easiest thing that I think I
can do is go plant some more
hostas. I think I have like 6
or 7 already in the garden, but
we will keep doing that. I need
more, really appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
>> Thank you so much for having
me.
