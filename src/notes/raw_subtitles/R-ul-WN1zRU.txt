Hi
 everyone.
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangian,
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth


Fund.
 And
 today
 I'm
 really
 excited


because
 I'm
 joined
 by
 my
 fellow


Norwegian,
 Burger
 Brenda.
 And
 Burger,
 he


is
 the
 president
 and
 CEO
 of
 the
 World


Economic
 Forum,
 the
 organization
 behind


the
 iconic
 divorce
 gatherings
 and
 that's


where
 the
 world's
 most
 powerful
 leaders


meet
 each
 year
 to
 shape
 the
 global


agenda.
 Um,
 Burger
 also
 happens
 to
 be,
 I


think,
 the
 best
 connected
 person
 in
 the


world.
 So,
 uh,
 Burger,
 pleasure
 to
 have


you
 here.
 of
 coming
 from
 you
 that
 means


a
 lot
 um
 let's
 uh
 uh
 before
 we
 move
 on


to
 the
 big
 the
 really
 big
 topics
 for


listeners
 who
 uh
 don't
 know
 what
 exactly


is
 the
 World
 Economic
 Forum?
 So
 the


World
 Economic
 Forum
 is
 55
 years
 old.
 It


is
 an
 international
 organization
 for


public
 private
 cooperation.
 It's
 based


here
 in
 Geneva,
 Switzerland.
 It's
 not


for
 profit
 and
 as
 you
 said
 we're
 most


known
 for
 our
 annual
 meeting
 in
 Davos


that
 bring
 uh
 brings
 um
 key
 people
 from


business
 and
 governments
 together
 but
 we


have
 hundreds
 of
 meetings
 we
 have


hundreds
 of
 different
 initiatives
 public


private
 uh
 in
 the
 field
 of
 uh
 fighting


corruption
 through
 nature
 and
 climate
 uh


to
 reviving
 growth
 and
 trade.
 How
 many


people
 work
 at
 the
 forum?
 How
 big
 an


organization
 is
 it?
 So
 altogether
 um


around
 um
 thousand
 people.
 How
 do
 you


define
 success
 for
 the
 organization?


What
 what
 is
 it
 that
 you
 want
 to


achieve?
 It
 is
 when
 we
 can
 get
 people


together
 and
 we
 can
 facilitate
 progress.


And
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 that?
 So
 um
 of


course
 in
 today's
 world
 where
 we
 see


much
 more
 fragmentations
 and


polarization


is
 harder
 than
 in
 the
 past
 uh
 to
 get


people
 that
 don't
 even
 agree
 in
 the
 same


room.
 But
 even
 in
 the
 age
 of
 um


nationalism


and
 na
 nation
 states
 there
 is
 also


overlap
 in
 interest.
 So
 what
 we're


trying
 to
 identify
 uh
 between
 companies


and
 countries
 if
 there
 is
 overlap
 in


interest
 we
 can
 strike
 and
 we
 can
 maybe


form
 an
 initiative
 we
 can
 facilitate
 uh


the
 progress
 that
 I
 was
 referring
 to.
 So


for
 example
 look
 at
 cyber
 crime
 we


probably
 lose
 like
 four
 five
 trillion
 US


dollars
 a
 year
 in
 cyber
 crime.
 That's


like
 three
 4%
 of
 the
 global
 GDP.
 I
 think


even
 the
 G2,
 China
 and
 the
 US
 can
 agree


that
 is
 not
 a
 good
 idea.
 So
 there
 we
 can


work
 on
 rules
 and
 regulations
 uh
 on
 how


to
 get
 rid
 of
 this
 um
 criminal
 use
 of
 uh


cyber.
 I
 think
 there
 are
 also
 other


areas
 like
 future
 pandemics.
 Um


hopefully
 in
 the
 future
 we
 can
 come
 back


again
 to
 have
 some
 more
 consensus
 on


nature
 and
 climate.
 So
 these
 are
 areas


and
 this
 is
 our
 kind
 of
 modus
 operandi


uh
 today.
 Burger
 um
 let's
 let's
 um
 kick


off
 with
 some
 of
 these
 big
 uh
 big


questions.
 Um
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 to


operate
 between
 two
 world
 orders
 which
 I


guess
 is
 what
 we're
 doing
 just
 now.


Yeah,
 we
 are
 we
 had
 one
 world
 order
 uh


after
 uh
 the
 cold
 war
 89.
 Uh
 that
 was


like
 a
 win-win
 thinking.
 what
 is
 good


for
 you
 is
 good
 for
 me
 and
 vice
 versa.


Uh
 to
 more
 of
 approach
 now
 that
 is
 more


competitive.
 It's
 also
 more


mercantalistic
 from
 uh
 the
 past
 and
 you


know
 I'm
 not
 a
 big
 believer
 in
 beggar


thy
 neighbor.
 I
 think
 you
 should
 rather


prosper
 your
 uh
 neighbor
 but
 that
 world


order
 uh
 is
 not
 there
 anymore.
 And


between
 world
 orders,
 it's
 always
 uh


unruly
 times.
 We
 know
 that
 from
 history.


Some
 people
 would
 say
 that
 it's
 like


multi-
 polarity
 without
 multilateralism.


I
 would
 say
 it's
 more
 from
 soft
 power
 to


hard
 power.
 there
 is
 tough
 competition


and
 I
 just
 hope
 that
 the
 new
 world
 order


also
 will
 uh
 bring
 with
 it
 uh
 some
 uh


thinking
 of
 common
 rules
 so
 we
 don't
 end


up
 in
 like
 the
 law
 of
 the
 jungle
 uh
 in


the
 future.
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 will
 go
 uh


that
 far
 but
 it's
 obviously
 a
 different


world
 order
 than
 the
 one
 we
 were
 used


to.
 And
 how
 far
 do
 you
 think
 this
 uh


geopolitical
 fragmentation
 will
 go?
 It's


hard
 to
 say,
 but
 you
 know,
 world
 leaders


also
 want
 to
 revive
 growth.
 U
 to
 be


reelected,
 you
 need
 a
 good
 economy.
 And


I
 think
 they
 will
 also
 see
 that
 if
 you


go
 too
 far
 in
 n
 shoring,
 friend
 shoring


and
 only
 trade
 with
 people
 uh
 you
 like


and
 not
 uh
 where
 you
 get
 the
 best
 and


cheapest
 products
 um
 part
 of
 your
 then


as
 input
 factor
 will
 also
 come
 with
 um


economic
 cost
 and
 you
 will
 see
 more


sluggish
 uh
 growth.
 So
 hopefully
 there


uh
 will
 not
 be
 a
 full
 decoupling.
 I


think
 there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 securing
 of


the
 global
 value
 chains
 but
 I
 don't


think
 there
 will
 be
 a
 full
 decoupling


and
 additionally
 we
 are
 in
 a
 paradigm


shift
 with
 the
 new
 technologies.
 I
 guess


we'll
 come
 back
 to
 that
 but
 that
 can


also
 be
 supportive
 for
 uh
 economic


growth
 and
 maybe
 it's
 of
 course
 um
 then


competition
 but
 maybe
 also
 some


cooperation.
 So,
 in
 your
 mind,
 do
 you


think
 this
 is
 a
 temporary
 situation
 or


are
 we
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 a
 of
 an
 even


more
 significant
 split?
 I
 think
 we're


not
 going
 to
 see
 the
 old
 era
 back
 with


uh
 the
 era
 where
 you
 had
 globalization


and
 you
 had
 um


like
 uh
 the
 UN
 sharper
 basis
 of
 the


corporation,
 the
 rule
 of
 law.
 I
 think


there
 still
 will
 be
 aspects
 of
 this
 but


I
 think
 there
 will
 be
 more
 uh
 strong


powers.
 It
 will
 be
 interest.


We
 will
 also
 go
 into
 a
 situation
 where


uh
 trade
 will
 look
 uh
 differently.
 But


hopefully
 it
 will
 be
 a
 real


globalization
 and
 hopefully
 the
 new


technologies
 can
 also
 play
 uh
 good


factor
 be
 a
 good
 um
 and
 pass
 positive


contributor
 uh
 to
 growth
 and
 not
 a


situation
 where
 the
 winner
 takes
 it
 all.


Do
 you
 think
 we'll
 see
 a
 period
 of


economic
 stagnation?
 I
 think
 there
 are


elements
 that
 are
 no
 uh
 slowing
 uh
 down


the
 global
 growth
 and
 I
 think
 the
 fact


that
 we
 have
 the
 highest
 global
 debt


since
 1945


also
 gives
 nation
 states
 um
 a
 harder


time
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 recession.


There
 is
 not
 that
 much
 of
 fiscal


muscles.
 But
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I
 don't


think
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 repetition
 of


the
 sluggish
 growth
 from
 the
 1970s.
 And


why
 is
 that?
 I
 think
 as
 I
 already


mentioned
 the
 new
 technologies
 are
 so


incredibly
 powerful
 and
 uh
 the
 way
 that


trade
 was
 the
 engine
 of
 growth
 for


decades
 grew
 two
 to
 three
 times
 more
 uh


than
 trend
 growth
 I
 think
 uh
 the
 new


technologies
 will
 be
 the
 big
 game


changer
 they
 will
 increase
 productivity


maybe
 with
 10%
 in
 the
 coming
 decade
 and


they
 can
 then
 be
 the
 factors
 that
 will


still
 continue
 with
 growth
 even
 if
 there


is
 more
 decoupling
 in
 the
 global
 economy


and
 the
 global
 economy
 has
 been


surprisingly
 resilient
 so
 far
 even
 in
 uh


a
 very
 difficult
 geopolitical
 uh


situation.
 So
 I'm
 more
 half
 like
 half


glass
 full
 than
 half
 glass
 empty.
 Why
 do


you
 think
 the
 economy
 and
 financial


markets
 have
 been
 so
 resilient?
 I
 think


there
 uh
 is
 um
 we
 we
 already
 see
 uh
 the


effect
 especially
 in
 the
 US
 and
 I
 think


partly
 uh
 also
 in
 India


uh
 of
 the
 new
 um
 technologies
 I
 think


you're
 seeing
 productivity
 gains
 you're


seeing
 huge
 investments
 you're
 going
 to


see
 new
 breakthroughs
 in
 medicine
 uh
 in


sciences
 that
 we
 haven't
 seen
 um
 in
 a


long
 time.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 part
 of
 it


and
 I
 think
 what
 we've
 seen
 so
 far
 on


protectionist
 measures
 have
 not
 been
 so


severe
 that
 um
 you
 have
 impacted


uh
 too
 much
 uh
 the
 growth
 that
 was


already
 there
 uh
 post
 uh
 COVID
 and
 also


due
 to
 the
 huge
 stimulus.
 But
 it
 is
 a


fact
 that
 we
 are
 growing
 slower
 now
 uh


than
 uh
 before
 co
 and
 for
 decades
 we
 had


a
 global
 trend
 growth
 of
 close
 to
 4%.
 We


are
 no
 more
 than
 we're
 closer
 to
 3%.
 And


that
 is
 not
 going
 to
 solve
 the
 big


challenges
 we
 have
 globally.
 It's
 not


going
 to
 lead
 us
 to
 meeting
 the


sustainable
 development
 goals.
 It's
 not


going
 to
 eradicate
 poverty
 in
 the
 same


way
 as
 we
 saw
 in
 the
 last
 decades.


provided
 that
 the
 new
 technologies
 will


not
 bring
 us
 up
 closer
 to
 4%
 again.
 And


that
 that
 is
 my
 hope.
 And
 the
 positive


thing
 with
 the
 new
 technologies,
 they're


not
 polluting.
 They're
 not
 building
 like


big
 pipes
 uh
 uh
 with
 uh
 huge
 emissions.


These
 are
 this
 is
 growth
 uh
 where
 it's
 a


very
 different
 growth
 uh
 than
 in
 the


past.
 Much
 more
 sustainable.
 uh
 back
 in


January
 um
 in
 Davos
 um
 the
 uh
 the


Americans
 were
 really
 optimistic
 and


very
 bullish
 about
 the
 outlook
 whilst


Europeans
 uh
 they
 were
 kind
 of
 uh
 more


like
 they
 were
 in
 some
 kind
 of
 funeral.


What's
 been
 um
 happening
 in
 the
 US
 since


and
 just
 where
 is
 where
 do
 you
 think


where
 do
 you
 see
 the
 US
 going
 um
 in
 a


way
 both
 both
 at
 home
 and
 also
 at
 the
 at


the
 world
 scene?
 It's
 hard
 to
 predict.


uh
 there
 is
 news
 every
 day
 but
 at
 the


same
 time
 uh
 the
 US
 is
 like
 27%
 of
 the


global
 economy
 with
 5%
 of
 the
 global


population
 they
 have
 almost
 50%
 of
 the


global
 military
 power
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 big


and
 most
 innovative
 companies
 are
 in
 the


US
 so
 I
 think
 there
 still
 uh
 is
 going
 to


be
 uh
 a
 vibrant
 economy
 in
 the
 US
 but


they're
 also
 um
 facing
 inflation
 and


immigration.
 The
 latter
 is
 high
 on
 the


administration's
 agenda.
 Uh
 the
 first


one
 is
 more
 complicated
 if
 you
 are


paying
 more
 for
 imports
 and
 you're


creating
 also
 a
 tougher
 uh
 market
 at


home
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 access
 to
 labor


can
 lead
 to
 higher
 inflation.
 So
 these


were
 uh
 the
 two
 big
 eyes
 that
 was
 were


promised
 by
 Trump
 fighting
 inflation
 and


uh
 immigration.
 But
 overall
 I
 do
 think


still
 that
 the
 US
 economy
 is
 uh
 very


solid.
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 continue
 to


uh
 grow
 I
 believe
 more
 in
 the
 soft


landing
 uh
 than
 in
 the
 hard
 landing.


Geopolitically


uh
 of
 course
 it
 is
 um
 definitely
 a


different
 administration
 uh
 than
 um
 in


the
 past
 and
 the
 Europeans
 are


struggling
 with
 this
 but
 at
 the
 same


time
 uh
 I
 think
 the
 side
 also
 has


changed
 in
 Europe
 since
 Davos.
 In
 what


ways?
 Because
 uh
 in
 Davos
 there
 was
 like


gloom
 and
 doom
 uh
 when
 it
 came
 to


Europe.
 I
 think
 uh
 things
 are
 not
 as
 bad


in
 Europe.
 Uh
 look
 at
 the
 fastest


growing
 of
 all
 the
 OCD
 economies


including
 American
 economy
 is
 Spain
 and


Spain
 was
 almost
 written
 off
 20
 years


ago
 at
 least
 15
 years
 ago
 they
 had
 youth


unemployment
 of
 40%.
 Another
 very
 fast


growing
 economy
 is
 Greece
 that
 was


definitely
 written
 off
 and
 the
 whole


euro
 was
 written
 off
 and
 it's
 still
 the


second
 most
 important
 currency
 in
 the


world.
 We're
 seeing
 also
 scientists
 and


others
 coming
 to
 Europe.
 Europe
 is
 seen


as
 a
 place
 uh
 where
 there
 is
 high
 life


quality.
 Uh
 we
 know
 there
 is
 a
 tal


talent
 war
 going
 on.
 So
 maybe
 Europe
 can


get
 uh
 in
 a
 better
 shape
 when
 it
 comes


to
 talent.
 But
 red
 tape
 uh
 bureaucracy


um
 and
 uh
 so
 far
 not
 uh
 the
 most
 robust


followup
 of
 the
 draggy
 report
 is
 holding


Europe
 back
 and
 also
 internal
 political


uh
 impulses.
 uh
 we
 have
 the
 AFD
 big


party
 now
 uh
 in
 Germany
 but
 at
 the
 same


time
 we
 um
 also
 see
 uh
 that
 some
 of
 the


incubant
 parties
 are
 also
 uh
 doing


better.
 So
 I'm
 more
 optimistic
 on
 Europe


now
 than
 I
 was
 just
 a
 few
 months
 ago.


How
 do
 you
 read
 the
 relationship
 between


US
 and
 China?
 That
 relationship
 is
 the


most
 important
 one
 uh
 in
 the
 world.
 the


so-called
 G2
 as
 I
 mentioned
 uh
 US
 almost


30%
 of
 the
 global
 GDP
 China
 almost
 20


that's
 almost
 half
 of
 our
 global
 economy


and
 they
 are
 definitely
 competing
 it's
 a


big
 competition
 between
 these
 two


nations
 and
 they
 have
 different


interests
 swares
 and
 uh
 China
 uh
 has


been
 also
 um
 constantly


uh
 relying
 less
 on
 export
 to
 the
 US
 if


you
 look
 Now
 at
 the
 Chinese
 export
 to


the
 US,
 it's
 gone
 down
 from
 20%
 of
 their


export
 in
 2013
 to
 now
 I
 think
 is
 around


11
 12%.
 So
 they're
 more
 resilient,


they're
 more
 diversified.
 But
 of
 course


uh
 China
 is
 also
 faced
 with
 economic
 uh


domestic
 challenges
 as
 uh
 in
 the
 US.
 uh


there
 is
 a
 export-led
 economy
 when


export
 is
 harder
 and
 also
 the
 demand


globally
 is
 changing
 from
 manufactured


goods
 to
 services
 and
 digital
 trade
 and


these
 are
 area
 where
 China
 is
 now
 trying


to
 pivot
 to
 worse
 but
 traditionally


they've
 been
 the
 big
 exporter
 of
 uh


manufactured
 goods
 and
 there
 we
 see
 that


the
 demand
 has
 peaked
 we
 also
 know
 that


the
 property
 prices.
 There
 is
 also
 a


shrinking
 of
 the
 workforce.
 So,
 China
 is


also
 faced
 with
 structural
 challenges,


but
 they're
 also
 very
 good
 at
 addressing


those
 things
 and
 they
 um
 are
 making
 uh


changes
 now
 for
 example
 in
 um
 the


community
 for
 entrepreneurs
 and
 also


startups
 and
 tech
 companies
 um
 that
 um
 I


think
 is
 well
 noticed
 by
 this
 community


in
 China.
 Just
 moving
 on
 to
 how
 you
 uh


get
 to
 your
 priorities.
 You
 uh
 play
 a


very
 big
 role
 um
 I
 mean
 you
 and
 the


world
 economic
 forum
 in
 in
 in
 shaping


the
 global
 conversations.
 How
 do
 you
 how


do
 you
 decide
 what
 should
 be
 on
 the


agenda
 on
 the
 end
 agenda
 in
 Davos?
 So
 we


uh
 try
 to
 look
 at
 um
 what
 are
 the
 topics


where
 we
 can
 make
 also
 progress
 where


bringing
 people
 together
 at
 least
 can


increase
 the
 understanding
 of
 each


other's
 challenges
 and
 in
 many
 ways
 we


are
 in
 the
 same
 boat
 and
 that
 I
 think
 we


are
 forgetting
 if
 we
 are
 faced
 with


transboundary
 challenges
 we
 cannot
 um


solve
 them
 as
 uh
 than
 single
 nation


states.
 We
 also
 think
 that
 while
 the


uh
 while
 countries
 are
 now
 very
 inepted,


some
 countries
 are
 more
 indeped
 at
 any


time
 since
 the
 Napoleonic
 war.
 So
 it's


like
 serious
 private
 sector
 is
 still


very
 vibrant.
 They
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 money


to
 invest.
 So
 um
 to
 work
 between
 private


sector
 and
 government
 I
 think
 is
 the
 way


forward
 also
 to
 then
 addressing
 and


solving
 some
 of
 the
 key
 challenges.
 You


need
 the
 private
 sector
 on
 board
 uh
 to


also
 make
 uh
 the
 right
 changes.
 These


are
 things
 we
 would
 like
 uh
 to
 discuss


uh
 also
 in
 Davos
 in
 20
 uh
 26.
 What's
 the


best
 way
 to
 discuss
 these
 topics?


Because
 uh
 you
 have
 big
 uh
 public


sessions,
 you
 have
 smaller
 invites
 only


tracks,
 you
 have
 bilateral
 meetings,
 you


got
 all
 kinds
 of
 all
 kinds
 of
 formats.


uh
 like
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you
 think
 is


the
 most
 efficient
 way
 of
 meeting
 people


and
 discussing
 big
 problems
 all
 the


above
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 not
 either
 or
 we


have
 to
 combine
 it
 a
 big
 public
 session


with
 the
 presidents
 and
 also
 key
 fortune


50
 cos
 uh
 increases
 uh
 the
 global


attention
 it
 can
 also
 be
 a
 good
 input
 to


smaller
 meetings
 where
 the
 same
 people


can
 meet
 and
 discuss
 and
 there
 is
 then


also
 the
 so-called
 Chattam
 House
 uh


based
 uh
 meetings
 where
 uh
 you
 cannot


use
 what
 is
 said
 there
 uh
 publicly
 that


also
 are
 pretty
 successful
 and
 then
 you


have
 bilateral
 meetings
 where
 people


meet
 uh
 in
 Davos
 and
 they
 can
 discuss


border
 conflicts
 they
 can
 discuss
 uh


challenges
 between
 uh
 nations
 or


companies.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 whole


ecosystem
 uh
 is
 also
 based
 on
 an


understanding
 that
 uh
 in
 Davos
 you
 come


with
 a
 mindset
 to
 find
 solutions
 not
 to


just
 articulate
 what
 um
 what
 what
 you


disagree
 on.
 You
 get
 together
 the


so-called
 global
 elite
 who
 are
 the
 who


are
 the
 really
 important
 people
 in
 the


world
 today.
 So
 uh
 we
 say
 that
 we
 bring


together
 uh
 leaders
 from
 government
 and


leaders
 uh
 from
 the
 private
 sector
 and


also
 leaders
 from
 universities,
 science,


um
 labor
 unions,
 uh
 also
 civil
 society


and
 together
 uh
 they
 form
 a
 unique


multi-
 stakeholder
 blend
 where
 I
 think


we
 can
 uh
 then
 uh
 achieve
 things


together
 and
 we've
 seen
 that
 um
 In
 the


past,
 for
 example,
 the
 whole
 notion
 of


finding
 traffic
 rules
 uh
 when
 it
 comes


to
 the
 new
 technologies
 that
 the
 humans


should
 be
 on
 top
 of
 the
 algorithms
 and


not
 the
 algorithms
 uh
 of
 the
 humans
 uh


shouldn't
 be
 controversial.
 These
 are


things
 that
 we
 are
 able
 to
 discuss
 in


Davos,
 but
 we're
 not
 able
 to
 finalize
 of


course
 these
 kind
 of
 rules.
 That's
 for


um
 other
 bodies
 uh
 to
 do.
 But
 the


strength
 of
 a
 multistakeholder
 meeting


like
 this
 is
 that
 um
 we
 can
 bring
 uh


players
 together
 that
 uh
 it
 is
 necessary


to
 bring
 together
 to
 see
 any
 kind
 of


progress.
 This
 group
 which
 you
 called


the
 multistakeholder
 uh
 group
 uh
 how
 how


has
 that
 changed
 over
 the
 last
 10
 years?


What
 what
 type
 of
 people
 are
 uh
 coming


in
 and
 who
 are
 going
 out?
 So
 that's
 a


good
 question.
 um
 you
 know
 that
 uh
 in


the
 companies
 they
 we
 have
 seen
 a


tendency
 of
 uh
 cos
 lasting
 shorter
 than


in
 the
 past
 three
 four
 years
 and
 then


some
 companies
 just
 change
 the
 uh
 co
 we


also
 know
 that
 being
 in
 power
 today
 is


tough
 being
 in
 government
 there
 is


anti-inccubent
 factor
 for
 those


countries
 at least
 that
 do
 have


uh
 these
 kind
 of
 elections
 so
 I
 think
 we


in
 the
 past
 could
 see
 some
 people
 come


for
 decades.
 Um
 that's
 less
 frequent
 now


at
 least
 uh
 from
 Europe
 and
 North


America.
 We
 see
 uh
 that
 um
 the
 name
 tags


are
 changing
 much
 more
 frequently.
 What


are
 the
 implications?
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it's


also
 a
 sign
 of
 um
 uh
 shortterm
 thinking


uh
 in
 many
 companies
 and
 uh
 in
 many


countries.
 It
 takes
 time
 uh
 to
 um
 really


be
 successful
 in
 implementing
 a


strategy.
 So
 if
 you're
 elected
 uh
 in
 a


country,
 you
 have
 to
 really
 work
 hard


the
 first
 year
 to
 implement
 the
 reforms


and
 hopefully
 you
 will
 see
 the
 positive


results
 um
 four
 years
 later
 is
 when
 the


elections
 are
 there.
 But
 you
 know
 some


reforms
 you
 can
 only
 see
 the
 result
 of


in
 a
 in
 a
 decade's
 uh
 perspective.
 Um


and
 I
 think
 the
 same
 uh
 are
 in


companies.
 some
 companies
 are
 more


long-term
 and
 not
 only
 focused
 on
 the


last
 quarter's
 results,
 but
 I
 think


there
 is
 a
 tendency
 uh
 for
 that.
 But


with
 the
 new
 technologies
 with
 all
 the


challenges
 we're
 faced
 with
 I
 I
 think


one
 um
 also
 should
 not
 forget
 that
 um
 we


should
 also
 acknowledge
 the
 importance


of
 being
 u
 medium
 long-term
 uh
 in
 your


perspective
 and
 that
 should
 also
 be
 uh


rewarded.
 Is
 it
 more
 difficult
 to
 build


trust
 in
 a
 world
 where
 people
 are


changing
 uh
 more
 frequently?
 So
 um
 it


comes
 with
 its
 challenges
 but
 we're
 also


been
 better
 at
 uh
 including
 um
 seuitees


from
 companies
 not
 only
 the
 CEO
 and
 the


chairperson
 but
 also
 other
 uh
 people
 in


the
 leadership
 of
 companies
 and
 the
 same


with
 countries.
 So
 we
 also
 know
 invite


key
 opposition
 leaders
 from
 uh
 some


countries.
 So
 overall,
 I
 think
 we're


still
 able
 to
 have
 uh
 a
 great
 uh
 crowd


uh
 in
 and
 at
 our
 meetings.
 Uh
 we
 are
 for


example
 now
 uh
 going
 to
 go
 to
 TNEN
 China


for
 summer
 doubles
 in
 um
 four
 weeks
 and


the
 sign
 up
 there
 is
 incredible.
 We


haven't
 seen
 this
 kind
 of
 numbers
 in
 a


long
 time.
 So
 I
 think
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of


interest
 to
 also
 decipher
 what
 is
 really


happening
 to
 connect
 the
 dots.
 So
 before


people
 came
 also
 um
 for
 the
 initiatives


and
 the
 partnerships
 I
 think
 that
 still


is
 important
 but
 the
 world
 has
 become
 so


complex
 that
 we're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of


leaders
 coming
 and
 say
 we
 really
 just


need
 to
 meet
 to
 understand
 um
 what
 what


are
 the
 possible
 uh
 prospects
 uh
 for
 the


future?
 What
 are
 the
 scenarios
 out
 there


and
 more
 focus
 on
 resilience?
 how
 to


build
 capacity
 to
 handle
 the
 unknowns.


On
 a
 more
 um
 personal
 level,
 what's
 the


best
 way
 to
 build
 relationships
 and


trust
 because
 that's
 kind
 of
 what
 you
 do


for
 a
 living,
 right?
 I
 think
 that
 um
 you


have
 to
 be
 an
 honest
 broker.
 Uh
 you
 have


to
 not
 um
 then
 overpromise.


uh
 you
 should
 all
 always
 um
 uh
 overd


deliver
 uh
 instead
 of
 um
 of
 of
 the


opposite.
 Uh
 and
 you
 have
 we
 are
 a


impartial
 organization.
 So
 we
 are
 very


clear
 that
 we
 work
 as
 closely
 with
 the


India
 as
 we
 do
 with
 the
 US,
 Brazil,


China
 and
 we
 we
 are
 like
 a
 facilitator


and
 a
 platform.
 We're
 not
 an


organization
 that
 is
 an
 activist


organization
 saying
 that
 uh
 we
 are


working
 for
 this
 and
 this
 the
 the
 far


furthest
 we
 go
 is
 to
 say
 that
 we're


facilitators


of
 progress.
 I
 think
 that
 is
 building


trust
 and
 um
 and
 over
 time
 they
 do
 see


that
 they
 get
 uh
 positive
 results
 of


engaging
 with
 the
 world
 economic
 firm.


What's
 the
 key
 to
 handling
 powerful


people
 with
 big
 eos?


I
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 to
 have
 a
 good


agenda
 that
 they
 feel
 that
 is
 worth


their
 time
 and
 um
 be
 very
 serious
 about


that.
 Hardworking
 and
 um
 we
 we
 we
 don't


uh
 give
 in
 to
 uh
 all
 the
 demands
 for
 uh


from
 all
 uh
 these
 um
 leaders.
 We
 are


very
 open
 and
 transparent
 about
 what
 we


can
 uh
 deliver
 and
 over
 time
 I
 I
 think


that
 has
 been
 our
 strength
 and
 and


leaders
 do
 come
 back
 and
 and
 that's
 a


it's
 a
 big
 compliment
 in
 Davos
 this
 year


we
 had
 more
 than
 60
 head
 of
 states
 and


governments
 we
 had
 70
 out
 of
 100
 fortune


100
 cos
 and
 this
 is
 not
 done
 overnight


it's
 hard
 work
 um
 over
 years
 and
 and


building
 that
 kind
 of
 trust
 uh
 what's


the
 most
 difficult
 diplomatic
 situation


you've
 been
 in?
 Wow.


Um,
 it
 was
 hard
 when
 uh
 I
 was
 foreign


minister
 in
 Norway
 and
 we
 negotiated
 the


the
 the
 peace
 agreement
 in
 Colombia


between
 the
 FAR
 gerilla
 and
 President


Sanchez,
 especially
 uh
 because
 it
 was
 an


armed
 conflict
 that
 had
 with
 President


Santos.
 It
 was
 um
 hard
 because
 this
 um


kind
 of
 internal
 armed
 conflict
 had
 gone


on
 uh
 for
 50
 years.
 It
 was
 also
 a
 bit
 of


a
 challenge
 when
 I
 was
 given
 the
 task
 to


repair
 and
 rebuild
 the
 diplomatic


relations
 between
 China
 and
 Norway.


something
 that
 took
 uh
 a
 few
 years


because
 there
 was
 uh
 no
 trust
 and
 you


have
 to
 stick
 of
 course
 to
 your
 national


values
 and
 and
 your
 integrity
 but
 at
 the


same
 time
 um
 it
 is
 in
 a
 country's


interest
 uh
 two
 countries
 interest
 to
 be


able
 to
 to
 work
 together.
 Okay.
 Uh
 I


need
 to
 ask
 some
 uh
 uh
 slightly


difficult
 questions
 too.
 So
 uh
 lots
 of


private
 jets
 uh
 at
 Davos
 uh
 you
 know


kind
 of
 a
 pretty
 pretty
 big
 contrast
 to


the
 climate
 focus
 you
 have
 just
 how
 do


you
 how
 do
 you
 look
 at
 these
 things?
 So


um
 it
 is
 true
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 um
 also


governmental
 leaders
 do
 come
 uh
 with


their
 presidential
 or
 official
 planes.


you
 know,
 when
 we
 have
 had
 Trump
 twice


uh
 in
 Davos,
 he
 he
 does
 land
 um
 with
 Air


Force
 One.
 He's
 got
 a
 new
 plane
 now.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 I
 saw
 that.
 Uh
 so
 uh
 but


it's
 still
 uh
 would
 be
 uh
 counted.
 And


it's
 also
 true
 that
 some
 of
 the
 big
 cos


of
 the
 world
 uh
 that
 run
 companies
 that


have
 a
 bigger
 turnover
 than
 many


countries,
 they
 also
 come
 with
 their


official
 planes.
 I
 think
 that
 is
 uh
 de


facto
 uh
 a
 reality
 and
 is
 not
 going
 to


change
 um
 with
 Davos.
 So
 I'm
 I'm
 um
 I'm


just
 registering
 this
 and
 um
 it's
 it's
 a


fact.
 What
 about
 this
 being
 very


exclusive
 and
 elitist
 in
 a
 in
 a
 world


where
 we
 perhaps
 need
 more
 transparency


and
 openness?
 I
 think
 we're
 very


transparent.
 I
 think
 we're
 very
 open.
 Uh


I
 think
 the
 World
 Economic
 Forum
 has


like
 40
 million
 followers
 in
 social


media
 and
 we
 put
 out
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 uh


there.
 Uh
 I
 was
 indirectly
 addressing


this
 earlier
 on
 because
 you
 used
 the


word
 elite
 but
 I
 didn't
 really
 want
 to


go
 into
 a
 discussion
 about
 it.
 But
 you


know
 when
 you
 have
 the
 head
 of
 states


and
 governments
 from
 countries,
 you
 have


the
 key
 cos
 from
 the
 key
 companies,
 you


have
 the
 leaders,
 directors
 from
 the
 key


Ivy
 League
 uh
 institutions
 of
 the
 world,


you
 can
 say
 these
 are
 the
 true
 leaders


in
 the
 world
 that
 can
 if
 they
 come


together
 make
 a
 positive
 uh
 influence.


You
 can
 also
 call
 them
 the
 elite.
 I


think
 they're
 all
 very
 uh
 at
 least
 most


of
 them
 very
 hardworking
 people
 that


have
 come
 to
 these
 positions
 and
 I
 think


it's
 good
 to
 bring
 them
 uh
 together.


Some
 of
 our
 meetings
 are
 open
 uh
 to
 the


public.
 Some
 meetings
 uh
 as
 I
 also


mentioned
 are
 closed
 meetings
 because
 if


you
 discuss
 for
 example
 between
 Armenia


and
 Aabajan
 uh
 the
 border
 uh
 conflict


that
 cannot
 be
 for
 open
 camera
 if
 you


want
 to
 have
 progress
 when
 we
 have
 had


discussions


among
 Palestinians
 and
 Israelis
 in
 Davos


when
 we
 have
 had
 discussions
 also


between
 Americans
 and
 and
 Chinese
 of


course
 these
 should
 be
 uh
 closed


meetings
 uh
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 make


prog
 progress
 and
 if
 there
 are
 things
 to


announce
 then
 it
 will
 be
 announced
 in


the
 press
 conference.
 Now
 your
 founder


Klaus
 Schwab
 recently
 stepped
 down
 um


and
 I
 appreciate
 this
 is
 a
 very


sensitive
 issue
 but
 what
 can
 you
 tell
 us


about
 uh
 about
 this?
 So
 uh
 um
 our


founder
 Klaus
 Shra
 has
 stepped
 down


after
 55
 uh
 years.
 uh
 he
 is
 our
 founder


and
 I
 work
 with
 him
 uh
 closely
 uh
 for


the
 last
 uh
 7
 and
 a
 half
 uh
 years.
 Um
 he


is
 now
 87
 years
 old
 and
 he
 said
 that
 he


chose
 not
 to
 step
 down
 uh
 due
 to
 to
 age.


That
 was
 his


his
 statement.
 And
 what
 is
 your


statement?
 Yeah,
 the
 same.
 Okay.
 How


will
 you
 change
 the
 leadership
 culture


going
 forward?
 So
 uh
 the
 human
 capital


of
 the
 world
 economic
 forum
 is
 the
 real


capital.
 uh
 as
 I
 mentioned
 we
 have


thousand
 uh
 I
 have
 thousand
 colleagues


uh
 at
 um
 web
 and
 uh
 these
 are
 the
 people


that
 uh
 also
 contribute
 every
 day
 uh
 to


the
 mission
 of
 the
 forum
 to
 improve
 the


state
 of
 the
 world
 or
 to
 to
 facilitate


uh
 progress
 but
 you
 know
 to
 motivate


people
 uh
 that
 is
 of
 this
 kind
 of


caliber
 that
 we
 uh
 recruit
 uh
 you
 have


to
 build
 strong
 teams
 it's
 all
 about


motivation.
 If
 you're
 motivated,
 you
 get


so
 much
 done
 and
 if
 you
 feel
 what
 you're


doing
 is
 also
 important,
 you're
 even


more
 motivated.
 So
 that
 will
 um
 be
 uh


and
 is
 my
 big
 task.
 making
 sure
 that
 we


have
 the
 best
 talent
 in
 the
 world
 that


you
 know
 one
 person
 can
 go
 very
 fast
 but


if
 you
 want
 to
 go
 far
 we
 have
 to
 go
 all


together
 and
 the
 world
 economic
 forum


should
 also
 uh
 be
 a
 great
 place
 uh
 to


work
 have
 a
 great
 workplace
 culture
 that


is
 my
 goal
 what
 have
 you
 brought
 from
 uh


a
 life
 in
 politics
 you
 were
 head
 of
 the


uh
 the
 Red
 Cross
 uh
 and
 so
 on
 what
 what


leadership
 ideals
 have
 you
 brought
 into


the
 organization


You
 know
 that's
 u
 understanding
 also
 uh


how
 governments
 work
 and
 also
 uh
 the


private
 sector
 and
 how
 you
 can
 then
 by


matching
 them
 uh
 making
 uh
 progress
 is


something
 that
 you
 learn
 uh
 if
 you
 work


both
 in
 private
 sector
 and
 in
 uh
 in


government.
 So
 I'm
 spending
 a
 lot
 of
 my


time
 on
 trying
 to
 be
 creative


uh
 in
 new
 ways
 of
 breaking
 impulses


because
 there
 are
 so
 many
 impulses.
 So


for
 example,
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 during
 COP


uh
 26
 in
 Glasgow,
 we
 got
 this
 uh
 idea
 of


having
 the
 leading
 global
 companies


using
 their
 purchasing
 power
 to
 green


their
 supply
 chain
 saying
 that
 for


example
 Apple
 says
 that
 25%
 of
 their


aluminium
 needs
 to
 be
 green.
 If
 you
 have


companies
 uh
 doing
 this,
 it
 sets
 really


a
 strong
 example.
 It's
 their
 right


because
 they're
 privately
 owned


companies.
 So
 they
 can
 do
 this
 and
 that


creates
 also
 a
 big
 demand.
 We
 have
 for


example
 for
 years
 now
 had
 a
 coalition
 of


100
 companies
 uh
 going
 further
 than
 the


national
 legislation
 on
 fighting


corruption,
 opening
 up
 for
 transparency.


we
 are
 losing
 trillions
 of
 US
 dollars


every
 year
 in
 corruption
 uh
 that
 should


have
 been
 invested
 differently.
 These


are
 the
 areas
 where
 I
 think
 with
 my


background
 I
 hopefully
 can
 combine


um
 political
 insights
 insights
 uh
 from


multi-ateral


organizations
 also
 with
 uh
 the
 private


sector
 that
 is
 unique
 at
 the
 forum


because
 we're
 public
 private
 but
 you


still
 talk
 about
 uh
 climate
 initiatives


and
 so
 on.
 Um
 now
 in
 some
 parts
 of
 the


world
 they
 talk
 less
 about
 it.
 What
 um


what
 is
 your
 view
 on
 on
 the
 on
 the
 kind


of
 Uturn
 or
 backlash
 we've
 seen
 against


uh
 against
 ESG
 and
 and
 and
 climate


initiatives.
 So
 um
 politics
 maybe
 have


changed
 but
 science
 hasn't.
 But
 it
 is


true
 that
 uh
 when
 you
 discuss
 climate


you
 also
 have
 to
 bring
 in
 energy.
 It's


like
 a
 triangle.
 There's
 still
 like
 700


million
 people
 on
 our
 planet
 that
 don't


even
 have
 access
 to
 electricity
 that
 is


needed
 uh
 to
 support
 progress
 and


development
 and
 we
 need
 to
 decouple
 uh


growth
 in
 energy
 and
 CO2
 emissions
 uh
 in


the
 future
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 we
 also


have
 to
 do
 it
 in
 a
 way
 that
 we
 don't


compromise
 on
 energy
 security.
 We
 have


seen
 in
 Europe
 uh
 how
 bad
 an
 idea
 it
 was


to
 base
 uh
 almost
 half
 of
 our
 natural


gas
 um
 from
 Russia.
 Diversification
 is


also
 important.
 So
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 not


simplistic.
 changing
 the
 energy
 um


demand
 and
 changing
 the
 way
 uh
 we
 also


um
 support
 our
 development
 with


different
 energy
 uh
 sources
 is
 the
 most


complex
 transition
 uh
 we've
 been
 through


uh
 probably
 for
 decades
 and
 uh
 we're


trying
 to
 show
 the
 complexity
 but
 still


what
 you
 can
 do
 with
 new
 technologies


like
 looking
 at
 the
 gen
 AI
 I
 now
 can


accelerate
 for
 example
 fusion
 uh
 nuclear


uh
 that
 we
 thought
 was
 like
 maybe
 going


to
 be
 available
 in
 three
 or
 four
 decades


commercially.
 Maybe
 we
 can
 do
 it
 in
 a


decade.
 That
 means
 a
 lot.
 Look
 at
 the


big
 developments
 we
 have
 had
 in
 China
 on


uh
 renewables.
 China
 is
 the
 first


electrostate


um
 a
 country
 that
 is
 basing
 a
 lot
 of


their
 energy
 now
 on
 electricity
 uh


sourced
 from
 uh
 renewables
 but
 of
 course


it
 has
 to
 be
 balanced
 they
 balance
 it


with
 uh
 then
 coal
 LG


and
 also
 uh
 nuclear
 so
 we're
 trying
 to


be
 balanced
 but
 still
 facilitating


progress
 and
 we
 still
 believe
 that
 the


cost
 of
 inaction
 far
 exceeds
 the
 cost
 of


action
 We
 briefly
 touched
 on
 on
 AI
 a


couple
 of
 times
 um
 and
 it's
 just
 totally


revolutionary
 in
 the
 way
 that
 we
 uh
 in


many
 of
 the
 things
 we
 do
 in
 our
 company.


Just
 how
 do
 you
 think
 it
 will
 shape
 the


future
 of
 global
 business?
 It's
 already


changing
 um
 things
 uh
 very


fundamentally.


I
 thought
 we
 were
 going
 to
 be
 in
 like


the
 hardware
 phase
 for
 a
 bit
 longer


where
 you
 needed
 like
 trillions
 of
 US


dollars
 investing
 in
 the


uh
 new
 language
 models.
 But
 I
 think
 the


deepseek


uh
 experience
 from
 China
 suddenly
 this


company
 that
 no
 one
 had
 heard
 about
 had


then
 a
 landish
 model
 that
 was
 developed


for
 maybe
 one/ird
 one
 quarter
 of
 what


others
 had
 done
 shows
 that
 we're
 maybe
 a


little
 bit
 closer
 to
 the
 software
 phase


where
 we
 can
 do
 applications
 and
 with


that
 I
 I
 think
 we're
 just
 just
 going
 to


see
 like
 uh
 thousand
 flowers
 blossom
 uh


in
 the
 energy
 field
 uh
 and
 AI
 field
 uh


sorry
 uh
 in
 the
 years
 uh
 to
 come
 and


where
 I
 expecting
 big
 big
 changes
 is
 in


medicine
 the
 synthetic
 biology
 there's


going
 to
 be
 so
 many
 breakthroughs
 but


also
 of
 course
 there
 are
 jobs
 uh
 that


are
 today
 done
 by
 humans
 back
 offices


and
 all
 that
 that
 will
 be
 replaced
 by
 uh


gen
 AI
 but
 that
 is
 also
 the
 history
 that


you
 then
 move
 higher
 up
 in
 the
 value


chain
 like
 if
 you
 increase
 productivity


ity
 you
 can
 also
 increase
 prosperity
 but


it
 also
 creates
 some
 fair
 of
 course
 fair


for
 jobs
 and
 fairs
 about
 the
 future
 but


like
 look
 here
 in
 Switzerland
 when
 I'm


now
 based
 is
 uh
 95%
 of
 the
 population


worked
 in
 the
 agriculture
 sector
 100


years
 ago
 and
 now
 is
 like
 2%
 and
 they


produce
 much
 more
 food
 than
 back
 then
 of


2%
 of
 the
 population
 and
 um
 you
 could


ask
 where
 did
 all
 these
 people
 go
 yes


they
 went
 up
 in
 the
 value
 chain
 created


prosperity
 that's
 the
 future
 and
 that's


working
 at
 the
 World
 Economic
 Forum
 for


example
 for
 example
 not
 a
 bad
 place


um
 how
 do
 you
 think
 um
 how
 do
 you
 think


AI
 will
 change
 the
 geopolitical
 power


balance
 so
 uh
 the
 competition
 is
 fierce


um
 and
 I
 think
 the
 two
 big
 nations
 China


and
 the
 US
 uh
 also
 knows
 or
 know
 that


the
 country
 that's
 on
 top
 of
 the
 new


technologies
 will
 probably
 emerge
 as
 the


most
 powerful
 nation
 also
 of
 this


century.
 So
 that
 competition
 is
 going
 to


continue.
 But
 I
 think
 there's
 also
 other


players
 that
 will
 come
 in
 and
 things
 are


very
 hard
 to
 predict.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 for


example
 the
 list
 of
 the
 10
 companies
 in


the
 world
 with
 the
 highest
 market
 cap


today,
 many
 of
 them
 did
 not
 exist
 two
 or


three
 decades
 ago.
 So
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 uh


that
 the
 largest
 companies
 uh
 in
 a
 few


decades
 even
 are
 started
 yet
 and
 they


don't
 need
 to
 come
 from
 the
 big
 um
 in
 in


one
 of
 the
 big
 players
 uh
 country
 but


they
 do
 have
 things
 that
 of
 course
 uh


work
 in
 their
 interest.
 For
 example,


access
 to
 data.
 Data
 is
 the
 new
 oxygen


in
 this
 economy.
 If
 you're
 big
 a
 big


home
 market
 and
 access
 to
 data
 you
 have


uh
 comparative
 um
 advantage
 if
 you
 have


a
 lot
 of
 capital
 uh
 interested
 in


investing
 if
 you
 have
 great
 universities


if
 you
 have
 great
 R&D
 if
 you
 have
 great


engineers
 well
 educated
 people
 so
 um
 I


think
 the
 competition
 related
 to
 the
 new


technologies
 will
 be
 more
 important
 than


uh
 some
 of
 the
 more
 military
 defense


parts
 of
 the
 competition.


Do
 you
 think
 AI
 will
 um
 increase
 global


inequality?
 I'm
 not
 so
 sure.
 Um
 like
 the


because
 because
 in
 theory
 in
 theory
 it


should
 it
 should
 decrease
 it.
 But
 don't


you
 need
 a
 certain
 level
 of
 education,


energy
 and
 so
 on
 to
 really
 utilize
 it


and
 innovation
 and
 entrepreneurship


and
 also
 a
 young
 population
 uh
 that
 is


very
 techsavvy.


Um
 so
 as
 I
 mentioned


like
 in
 the
 platform
 economy
 the
 winner


took
 it
 all.
 We
 have
 this
 uh
 big
 uh


almost
 private
 superpowers
 uh
 that
 are


very
 dominating.


But


I
 think
 also
 you
 will
 see
 a
 lot
 of


startups
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 opportunities


uh
 also
 in
 emerging
 economies.
 Look
 at


for
 example
 India
 in
 this
 1.4
 four


billion
 people
 have
 no
 um
 um
 electronic


digital
 ID.
 Um
 there
 is
 like
 130
 uh


unicorns
 uh
 in
 China
 and
 it
 is
 like
 10


or
 something
 adding
 almost
 um
 on
 a


quarterly
 uh
 basis.
 we
 see
 growth
 there


is
 mainly
 related
 to
 services
 and


digital
 uh
 trade.
 So
 I
 think
 there
 is


the
 jury
 is
 out
 uh
 if
 you
 need
 the
 huge


trillion
 dollars
 u
 of
 investments.
 There


will
 be
 uh
 advantages
 for
 those
 that


have
 a
 lot
 of
 capital
 and
 where
 you
 want


to
 allocate
 your
 capital.
 But
 at
 the


same
 time
 we
 know
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 good


ideas
 have
 been
 developed
 in
 garages
 and


other
 places
 um
 in
 the
 past.
 Uh
 so
 this


open
 up
 also
 huge
 opportunities
 for
 the


countries
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 young
 people.


Look
 at
 Nigeria.
 Uh
 look
 at
 Indonesia,


India,
 Bangladesh,
 Vietnam.
 These
 very


fast
 growing
 economies
 that
 are
 emerging


economists.
 Okay,
 moving
 on
 to
 um
 um
 a


bit
 more
 uh
 personal
 uh
 questions.
 What


part
 of
 your
 job
 do
 you
 enjoy
 the
 most?


Where
 are
 you
 really
 in
 the
 flow?
 When
 I


can
 feel
 that
 we
 can
 contribute
 to


finding
 either
 solutions
 or
 make


progress
 when
 we
 could
 for
 example
 have


50


Israeli
 cos
 meeting
 with
 six
 50


Palestinian
 cos
 and
 they
 said
 that
 we


can
 work
 uh
 together.


uh
 when
 we
 know
 thinking
 about
 putting


together
 a
 delegation
 of
 cos
 that
 want


to
 go
 to
 Damascus
 and
 invest
 uh
 in
 a


wartorrn
 uh
 Syria.
 Uh
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 is


great.
 I
 also
 felt
 that
 the
 best
 moment


for
 me
 and
 that
 was
 when
 I
 went
 to
 a


small
 meeting
 between
 Americans
 and
 also


Chinese
 that
 looked
 at
 who
 can
 we
 even


in
 this
 polarized
 world
 uh
 find
 ways
 of


working
 uh
 together.
 That's
 that's
 the


part
 of
 the
 job
 uh
 I
 feel
 most


meaningful.
 Now
 um
 as
 we
 know
 uh
 no


prophet
 is
 honored
 in
 his
 own
 country


and
 uh
 you
 know
 you
 were
 the
 foreign


minister
 but
 it's
 really
 after
 you
 you


went
 global
 that
 you
 become
 uh
 you
 know


a
 rockstar
 and
 a
 heavyweight.
 Why
 why
 do


you
 think
 that
 is?


I'm
 not
 so
 sure
 uh
 if
 I'm
 in
 that
 uh


lacker
 category.
 I
 don't
 feel
 um
 like


that.
 But
 um
 I'm
 enjoying
 my
 job
 here
 at


the
 World
 Economic
 Forum.
 I
 also
 enjoyed


every
 day
 um
 almost
 at
 least
 uh
 in


Norwegian
 politics
 for
 almost
 30
 years


too
 and
 I
 learned
 so
 much
 uh
 through


that
 and
 um
 you
 know
 I'm
 very
 fond
 of
 my


home
 country
 I
 I
 think
 that
 Norway
 is


one
 of
 the
 best
 uh
 governed
 uh
 and
 run


countries
 uh
 in
 the
 world
 and
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 Nordic
 countries
 together
 uh


they're
 like
 10th
 largest
 economy
 in
 the


world
 and
 they
 have
 been
 able
 to
 have
 uh


substantial
 economic
 growth
 but
 at
 the


same
 time
 they're
 not
 uh
 doing
 so
 badly


when
 it
 comes
 to
 addressing
 inequalities


too.
 So
 it's
 it's
 my
 view
 is
 that
 equal


opportunities
 is
 incredibly
 important


for
 a
 success
 of
 a
 country.
 But
 of


course
 if
 you
 work
 hard
 you
 cannot
 end


up
 with
 the
 same
 results
 as
 those
 that


don't
 work
 so
 hard.
 But
 equal


opportunities
 meaning
 that
 you
 have


access
 to
 good
 schools,
 have
 a
 good


educational
 system
 that
 every
 young


talent
 can
 succeed.
 I
 think
 that
 is


something
 that
 is
 extremely
 close
 to
 my


heart.
 How
 do
 you
 relax?
 How
 do
 you


chill?
 In
 the
 mountains
 maybe
 uh
 in


Norway.
 I
 I
 I
 like
 it
 in
 the
 mountains.


I
 also
 like
 a
 Saturday
 morning
 with
 no


speeches,
 no
 travel,
 just
 uh
 to
 have
 a


cup
 of
 coffee
 and
 sit
 and
 read
 Financial


Times
 the
 Saturday
 morning.
 I'm
 like
 I


feel
 very
 privileged,
 very
 very


privileged
 and
 I
 can
 use
 one
 and
 a
 half


hour
 uh
 on
 that.
 So
 I'm
 I'm
 easily


satisfied
 in
 in in
 in
 that
 respect.
 What


else
 do
 you
 read?


So
 I
 read
 uh
 of
 course
 all
 the
 relevant


papers.
 Uh
 I
 read
 the
 So
 when
 you
 what


is
 that?
 What
 is
 all
 relevant
 papers?


What
 is
 that?
 No.
 So
 I
 read
 Financial


Times.
 I
 read
 Wall
 Street
 Journal.
 I


read
 uh
 New
 York
 Times.
 I
 read
 also


Washington
 Post.
 Of
 course
 not
 every


page
 every
 day
 but
 these
 are
 the
 papers


that
 I
 read.
 I
 read
 a
 few
 Norwegian


papers
 uh
 too.
 Uh,
 of
 course
 I
 need
 to
 f


follow
 a
 bit
 what
 is
 happening
 uh
 at


home.
 Uh,
 and
 uh
 then
 I
 uh
 also
 uh
 try


to
 uh
 read
 uh
 books
 mainly
 on
 things


that
 I'm
 not
 so
 knowledgeable
 about
 for


example
 the
 new
 technologies.
 I
 I
 forced


myself
 to
 read
 a
 lot
 of
 books
 about
 AI


and
 technology
 even
 if
 I
 do
 still
 prefer


to
 read
 books
 about
 geopolitics
 and


geoeconomy.
 But
 I'm
 I
 do
 understand
 that


in
 this
 role
 I
 I
 can
 I
 need
 to
 become


more
 techsavvy.
 What
 are
 you
 the
 most


grateful
 for
 in
 life?
 that
 I
 have
 um


grown
 up
 in
 a
 country
 uh
 where
 you
 could


uh
 pursue
 uh
 your
 uh
 interests
 and
 uh


that
 I
 have
 had
 the
 chance
 to
 also


contribute
 through
 public
 life
 for
 many


uh
 years
 and
 also
 seeing
 my
 kids
 growing


up
 uh
 in
 a
 country
 where
 there
 is
 uh


peace
 and
 they
 have
 had
 access
 uh
 to


good
 education.
 And
 um
 lastly,
 what
 is


your
 advice
 to
 young
 people?
 Work
 hard.


Uh
 be
 serious,


but
 not
 think
 about
 always
 if
 it's


greener
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 the
 fence.


You
 know,
 I
 have
 not
 applied
 for
 jobs
 in


my
 life.
 I
 I
 things
 I
 worked
 I
 think
 I


worked
 very
 hard
 but
 the
 opportunities


do
 come
 if
 you
 just
 do
 well
 in
 what


you're
 doing
 and
 try
 to
 work
 on


something
 that
 you're
 passionate
 about


and
 don't
 stress
 about
 the
 career.
 The


less
 you
 stress
 about
 your
 career
 uh
 and


more
 committed
 you
 are
 to
 what
 you're


doing
 uh
 then
 uh
 things
 have
 a
 tendency


of
 solving
 itself.
 That's
 what
 I
 trying


to
 tell
 also
 to
 all
 the
 very
 ambitious


uh
 young
 people
 at
 the
 World
 Economic


Forum.
 Well,
 Booger,
 you
 for
 sure
 have


been
 very
 committed
 to
 what
 you
 uh
 to


what
 you
 do
 and
 a
 big
 congratulations


with
 everything
 you
 uh
 you
 have


achieved.
 Big
 thanks
 for
 being
 with
 us.


Thank
 you,
 Nikolai.
 Thank
 you
 for


inviting
 me
 to
 your
 podcast.
 It's
 a
 big


honor.
 Thank
 you.
