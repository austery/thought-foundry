[Music]


Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 We


are
 live.
 It
 is
 Thursday,
 October
 23rd.


It
 has
 been
 a
 pretty
 quick
 week.
 I
 mean,


we
 are
 one
 day
 away
 from
 Friday,
 but


we're
 here.
 We're
 live.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 to


talk
 about.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for


being
 here.
 Got
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


headlines
 going
 on
 in
 the
 pre-market


there.
 We're
 we
 are
 going to
 get
 into


tomorrow.
 We
 will
 be
 getting
 CPI
 data.


So,
 I
 think
 uh
 today's
 market
 activity


is
 definitely
 going
 to
 be
 a
 bit


contingent
 on
 the
 perception
 of
 that
 CPI


data.
 And
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 some


of
 the
 overall
 projections
 that
 some
 of


the
 street
 has
 on
 what
 they
 think
 will


happen
 with
 CPI.
 On
 top
 of
 that,
 you


have
 a
 relatively
 green
 uh
 pre-market.


You're
 not
 seeing
 too
 much
 red.
 We
 did


have
 a
 pretty
 nasty
 day
 yesterday
 that


ended
 up
 recovering
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 day,
 which
 was
 good
 to
 see.
 Uh
 not
 a


full
 recovery,
 but
 you
 did
 get
 somewhat


of
 a
 bit
 of
 recovery.
 So,
 now
 we
 have
 to


see
 if
 that
 recovery
 can
 continue.
 S&P


500
 is
 green
 in
 the
 pre-market
 along


with
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 other
 risk
 assets.
 So,


we'll
 talk
 about
 that
 and
 we're
 going to


see
 if
 that
 can
 continue
 to
 be
 green.


Now,
 S&P,
 okay,
 just
 flipped
 red.
 It
 was


green
 like
 10
 minutes
 ago.
 Uh
 but


overall,
 it's
 not
 as
 bad
 as
 it
 was


yesterday
 when
 yesterday
 was
 down
 about


1.2%
 2%
 at
 the
 worst
 of
 it.
 S&P
 500


right
 there
 down
 about4
 AMD
 down
 half
 a


percent.
 S&P
 or
 SoFi
 down
 point4
 Google


actually
 green
 grab
 green
 Amazon
 green


hoodie
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 then


pounder
 down
 about
 74.
 We
 also
 have
 a


new
 pounder
 contract
 that
 we'll
 talk


about
 $200
 million
 deal
 with
 Lumen


Technologies.
 So
 we'll
 get
 into
 that


contract
 and
 discuss
 what's
 going
 on
 uh


with
 Pounder
 as
 well.
 We
 have
 some


updates
 on
 the
 China
 trade
 negotiations.


We'll
 talk
 about
 that.
 Hopefully
 we
 are


getting
 closer
 to
 somewhat
 of
 a
 uh
 I


guess
 capitulation
 from
 both
 sides
 to


give
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 take
 a
 little
 bit


and
 hopefully
 we
 get
 something
 where


it's
 like
 all
 right
 this
 is
 what's
 going


to
 happen.
 Uh
 and
 maybe
 that
 ends
 up


taking
 place
 before
 the
 meetings
 in


South
 Korea
 with
 Xi.
 Trump
 will
 be
 going


to
 Malaysia.
 He's
 going
 to
 do
 an


announcement
 at
 3
 p.m.
 in
 the
 Oval


Office
 today.
 Don't
 know
 what
 the


announcement
 is
 going
 to
 be
 about.
 Last


time
 it
 was
 about
 in
 vitro


fertilization.
 So
 it
 might
 not
 even
 be


about
 the
 economy,
 but
 we're
 going to


see
 later
 at
 3
 p.m.
 what
 he
 talks
 about.


And
 then
 I
 believe
 tomorrow
 he
 goes
 to


Malaysia
 and
 then
 next
 week
 he
 goes
 to


South
 Korea
 for
 those
 negotiations
 with


President
 Xi.
 On
 top
 of
 that,
 you
 got


Tessy
 down
 about
 4%
 right
 here
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 We
 will
 be
 discussing
 what


happened
 with
 Tesla.
 Look,
 it
 was
 not


the
 best
 earnings
 in
 the
 world.
 It
 was


definitely
 not
 the
 worst
 earnings
 in
 the


world.
 So,
 the
 streets
 giving
 it
 a
 bit


of
 a
 sideways
 reaction.
 3%
 down
 is


similar
 price
 to
 where
 Tesla
 was
 last


week.
 So,
 I
 think
 if
 you're
 a
 Tesla


shareholder,
 it's
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a


deal.
 Uh,
 but
 nonetheless,
 we'll
 discuss


kind
 of
 what
 Elon
 said
 on
 the
 call
 and


the
 core
 arguments
 that
 were
 made
 on
 the


Tesla
 earnings.
 They
 did
 miss
 on
 EPS


unfortunately
 by
 about
 5
 cents.
 They


beat
 on
 revenue
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep


going
 from
 there.
 We
 do
 have
 a
 bunch
 of


other
 companies
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 that


reported
 earnings.
 Pretty
 much
 all
 of


them
 again
 beats
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the


bottom
 line
 which
 is
 really
 good.
 So
 far


85%
 of
 companies
 that
 reporting
 the
 S&P


500
 have
 beat
 their
 earnings.
 And
 if


that
 can
 continue
 going
 into
 next
 week,


which
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 biggest
 week


for
 big
 tech
 earnings,
 then
 that
 should


be
 good
 for
 the
 broader
 markets
 as
 well.


All
 right,
 let's
 get
 into
 it.
 Good


morning.
 Good
 morning.
 Good
 morning.


Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.


Maddie,
 what's
 up?
 Dave,
 what's
 up?


Jason,
 Scott,
 what's
 up?
 Thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 Hector,
 how
 are
 you
 doing?


Danny,
 I'm
 Benny
 Irwin,
 good
 morning.


Uh,
 thank
 you
 all
 again
 for
 being
 here.


We
 have
 a
 lot
 a
 lot
 to
 discuss.
 Jay


Selton,
 LM,
 June,
 what's
 up?
 What's
 up?


Linda
 Dunce,


how
 are
 you
 late
 every
 day
 with
 an


office
 in
 your
 own
 apartment?
 Are
 you


stuck
 in
 traffic
 to
 your
 office
 with
 all


your
 binder
 dates?
 It's
 a
 good
 question.


It's
 a
 very
 good
 question.
 You
 know,


honestly,
 right
 when
 you're
 about
 to
 go


live,
 that's
 when
 everything
 gets
 messed


up.
 The
 camera
 starts
 being
 weird,
 the


lights
 not
 working,
 you
 don't
 have
 your


charger.
 Like,
 literally
 right
 when


you're
 about
 to
 go
 live,
 and
 then
 it


takes
 two
 minutes,
 and
 it's
 just
 every


time.
 Every
 single
 time,
 that's
 what


ends
 up
 happening.
 Dave
 T,
 Quarantine,


Quartet,
 Kareem,
 Carson,
 Jen,
 Percy,


thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here


today.
 All right,
 so
 let's
 get
 started


with
 the
 first
 story.
 And
 this
 first


story
 actually
 is
 something
 I
 didn't


mention
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 minutes.
 Uh,


but
 I
 think
 it
 is
 the
 juiciest
 story.


And
 so
 we
 might
 as
 well
 start
 off
 with


this
 one.
 And
 uh
 that
 is
 the
 story
 of


Quantum.
 So
 what
 happened
 over
 the
 past


week?
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 quantum
 names
 ended


up
 going
 down
 30
 to
 40%.
 It's
 been


pretty
 much
 a
 bloodbath
 in
 the
 quantum


ecosystem.
 Last
 night


actually
 when
 I
 was
 doing
 my
 deep
 dive,


I
 was
 writing
 up
 some
 uh
 which
 I
 I


hopefully
 will
 be
 out
 tomorrow.
 No


promises,
 but
 working
 on
 the
 the
 Nebus


deep
 dive
 for
 tomorrow.
 Um,
 I
 was
 I
 was


doing
 some
 research
 writing
 on
 Substack


and
 then
 I
 looked
 over
 on
 Twitter
 and


this
 was
 the
 first
 headline
 that
 popped


up
 and
 I
 knew
 this
 was
 going
 to
 be
 the


story
 of
 the
 next
 24
 hours
 and
 it
 has


become
 the
 story
 of
 the
 next
 24
 hours.


The
 Trump
 administration
 is
 in
 talks
 to


take
 equity
 stakes
 in
 quantum
 computing


firms
 including
 NQ,
 D-Wave,
 and
 Regetti.


I
 mean,
 I
 saw
 the
 headline
 and
 I
 was


just
 like,
 you
 got
 to
 be
 kidding
 me.


This
 is
 this
 can't
 be
 real
 life.
 But


this
 was
 the
 headline.
 Now,
 to
 to
 to
 be


fair
 to
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal,
 Reuters


came
 out
 this
 morning
 and
 said
 uh


there's
 a
 commerce
 representative
 that


said
 they
 are
 not
 specifically
 in


conversations
 with
 these
 companies,
 but


the
 sources
 that
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal


was
 using
 says
 no,
 they
 are
 in


conversation
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 quantum


computing
 companies.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 NQ


up
 8%
 in
 the
 pre-market,
 D-Wave
 up
 16%


in
 the
 pre-market,
 and
 then
 Regetti
 up


9%
 in
 the
 pre-market.
 All
 these
 stocks


are
 down
 about
 30
 40%.
 For
 the
 past


week,
 so
 there's
 two
 angles
 to
 this.


First
 of
 all,
 I
 I
 I
 just
 I
 want
 to
 do


the
 angle
 of
 what
 it
 would
 be
 like
 if


this
 were
 to
 happen
 while
 acknowledging


at
 the
 same
 time
 that
 there
 were


government
 officials
 that
 said
 this
 is


not
 happening.
 So,
 right
 now,
 it's
 kind


of
 a
 story
 of
 he
 said,
 she
 said.
 We


don't
 officially
 know
 if
 this
 is
 going


to
 happen
 or
 not,
 but
 the
 stocks
 are
 up


right
 now
 in
 the
 pre-market
 based
 on
 the


rumor
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 happen.
 And
 you


know,
 the
 rumor
 coming
 from
 the
 Wall


Street
 Journal
 will
 definitely
 get
 a
 lot


more
 people
 to
 think
 that
 there
 is
 a


possibility
 for
 this.
 So,
 um,
 I
 went


down
 the
 rabbit
 hole
 and
 I
 tried
 to


understand
 what
 would
 be
 the
 incentive


and
 motivation
 for
 this.
 And
 there
 was
 a


couple
 people
 on
 Twitter
 that
 pointed
 me


to
 this
 direction.
 And
 look,
 when
 you
 go


down
 this
 rabbit
 hole,
 it
 does
 start
 to


make
 a
 lot
 more
 sense.
 The
 deputy


secretary
 of
 defense
 for
 the
 US


government
 is
 a
 person
 named
 Steve


Fineberg.
 Okay.
 Fineberg
 also
 co-founded


a
 hedge
 fund
 called
 Cerebras
 Capital


Management
 and
 he
 was
 the
 CEO
 for
 30


years
 of
 this
 hedge
 fund
 before
 he
 left


in
 March
 of
 2024
 or
 2025
 which
 was
 like


seven
 months
 ago
 to
 become
 the
 deputy


secretary
 of
 defense.
 That
 hedge
 fund


has
 a
 position
 to
 the
 tune
 of
 hund00


million
 in
 NQ
 which
 is
 about
 2.4
 million


shares.
 So
 look
 again
 we
 don't
 know


exactly
 what's
 happening
 here
 but
 this


is
 starting
 to
 make
 a
 lot
 more
 sense
 to


me.
 My
 gut
 intuition
 on
 this
 is
 if
 this


were
 to
 happen,
 if
 the
 United
 States


government
 were
 to
 take
 equity
 stakes
 in


these
 companies,
 I
 do
 not
 think
 it's


because
 Trump
 believes
 in
 quantum


computing.
 I
 do
 not
 think
 it's
 because


the
 administration
 thinks
 quantum


computing
 is
 the
 next
 evolution
 of


technology
 that
 they
 need
 to
 have
 a
 uh


major
 focus
 in
 by
 taking
 an
 equity
 stake


in
 I
 personally
 think
 again
 gut
 reaction


that
 there
 are
 some
 people
 in
 that


administration
 that
 want
 to
 make
 sure


they
 can
 pump
 their
 backs.
 That's
 kind


of
 what
 it's
 looking
 like.
 And
 here's
 my


reasoning
 for
 why.
 And
 I'm
 and
 and
 you


know
 there's
 people
 that
 can disagree


with
 it,
 but
 here's
 my
 just
 overall


reason
 for
 why
 I'm
 open
 to
 change
 my


opinion.
 Number
 one,
 why
 does
 the
 US


taxpayer
 have
 to
 subsidize
 quantum?
 I


can
 understand
 why
 the
 US
 taxpayer
 has


to
 subsidize
 lithium.
 I
 can
 I
 can


understand
 why
 the
 US
 taxpayer
 has
 to


subsidize
 semiconductors
 from
 a
 national


security
 perspective.
 I
 can
 understand


why
 we
 have
 to
 subsidize
 rare
 earth


minerals
 and
 metals
 because
 at
 the
 end


of the
 day,
 all
 those
 products
 are


necessary
 in
 every
 part
 of
 our
 daily


life.
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 why
 we
 have
 to


subsidize
 quantum
 and
 so
 and
 another


reason
 I
 don't
 understand
 why
 we
 have
 to


subsidize
 quantum
 Google
 just
 to
 the


bullcase
 of
 quantum
 sundar
 just


announced
 that
 they
 had
 a
 massive


breakthrough
 in
 Willow
 yesterday
 that


was
 not
 subsidized
 by
 the
 US
 taxpayer


that
 was
 Google
 as
 a
 company
 with
 their


free
 cash
 flow
 because
 they
 actually


generate
 revenue
 unlike
 some
 of
 these


companies
 are
 able
 to
 invest
 and
 put
 the


R&D
 into
 building
 out
 quantum
 computing.


So
 from
 that
 perspective,
 I
 don't


necessarily
 understand
 why
 the
 United


States
 government
 would
 have
 to


subsidize
 some
 of
 these
 companies.
 Uh


and
 it
 also
 doesn't
 make
 sense
 to
 me
 why


the
 taxpayers
 to
 fit
 the
 bill
 for
 that


because
 these
 are
 private
 companies


working
 on
 like
 you
 know
 we
 we
 didn't


subsidize
 Nvidia
 when
 they
 were
 working


on
 GPUs
 20
 years
 ago.
 They
 they
 worked


on
 it.
 They
 developed
 the
 intellectual


property
 and
 then
 it
 ended
 up
 becoming
 a


reality.
 So
 I
 don't
 know
 exactly
 why


that's
 the
 case.
 On
 top
 of
 that,
 if
 you


read
 through
 the
 article,
 it's
 a
 10


million
 funding
 ward,
 aka
 a
 10
 million


equity
 stake,
 that
 the
 United
 States
 is


thinking
 of
 taking
 uh
 if
 this
 were
 to


happen.
 Based
 on
 the
 reporting
 from
 the


Wall
 Street
 Journal,
 these
 companies
 are


worth
 15
 to
 20
 billion.
 10
 million
 is


absolutely
 nothing.
 I
 mean,
 10
 million,


it's
 like
 a
 0.001%


stake
 of
 of of
 these
 companies.
 This
 is


not
 like
 a$8
 billion
 stake
 like
 they


took
 in
 Intel.
 So
 from
 that
 perspective,


it's
 also
 pretty
 weird
 because
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 it's
 like,
 well,
 wait
 a


second.
 $10
 million
 is
 absolutely


nothing.
 So
 the
 headline
 in
 and
 of


itself
 is
 more
 important
 than
 the
 equity


stake.


10
 billion
 is
 not
 real,
 bro.
 These


companies
 are
 worth
 almost
 $20
 billion.


What's
 the
 point
 of
 10
 million?
 Like
 10,


that's
 not
 even
 an
 equity.
 That's
 not


like
 a
 real
 stake
 in
 the
 company
 where


the
 United
 States
 could
 be
 focused
 on


like,
 oh,
 we
 have
 this
 massive
 stake.
 We


need
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 support
 that
 the


company
 does
 well.
 So
 look,
 from
 my


perspective,
 if
 this
 were
 to
 happen,
 and


again,
 you
 have
 conflicting
 reports
 this


morning
 saying
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 happen,


but
 then
 again,
 the
 stocks
 are
 reacting


as
 if
 it
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 based
 on


their
 prices
 going
 higher
 at
 9:30.
 We're


going
 to
 see
 when
 the
 market
 opens
 how


this
 plays
 out.
 If
 this
 does
 happen,


then
 the
 US
 is
 basically
 classifying
 all


these
 quantum
 computing
 names
 as


something
 that's
 in
 the
 interest
 of


national
 security
 to
 the
 tune
 of


semiconductors
 and
 rare
 earth
 metals.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that's
 necessarily
 the


case.
 Maybe
 that
 is
 the
 case.
 We're


going to
 see
 what
 the
 Trump


administration
 says.
 If
 they
 only
 take
 a


$10
 million
 equity
 stake,
 I
 don't
 think


I
 think
 at
 that
 point
 it's
 just
 a


headline
 because
 10
 million
 is
 nothing


substantial
 to
 get
 the
 street
 excited
 or


really
 to
 get
 like
 people
 excited
 that


the
 government
 actually
 cares
 about


these
 companies.
 And
 then
 finally,
 based


on
 going
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 rabbit


hole,
 you
 see
 some
 of
 the
 people
 that


are
 part
 of
 the
 administrations,
 see


some
 of
 the
 positions
 they
 have
 in
 terms


of
 their
 um
 hedge
 funds
 and
 money


management
 funds,
 and
 you
 start
 to


realize,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 some
 people
 uh


maybe
 some
 people
 told
 Donn
 to
 uh
 to


take
 to
 put
 a
 little
 money
 into
 quantum


to
 get
 the
 street
 excited.
 So,
 that's


what
 we
 got
 going
 on
 right
 now.
 We're


going
 to
 see
 how
 this
 ends
 up
 playing


out.
 Ultimately,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 what


the
 future
 of
 quantum
 computing
 looks


like.
 But,
 that
 is
 the
 headline.
 And


look,
 here's
 the
 thing,
 and
 this
 is
 why


as
 much
 as
 I'm
 not
 interested
 in
 buying


these
 stocks
 at
 these
 valuations,


definitely
 not
 interested
 at
 shorting,


and
 I've,
 you
 know,
 not
 even
 taken
 a
 put


position
 or
 bought
 any
 of
 the
 inverse


short
 funds
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 are
 driven
 by


hype
 and
 narrative.
 And
 if
 the
 narrative


becomes
 that
 the
 US
 government
 wants
 to


make
 sure
 that
 quantum
 succeeds,
 for


whatever
 reason,
 the
 US
 government
 is


super
 interested
 in
 it.
 Uh,
 yeah,
 you're


likely
 not
 going
 to
 see
 quantum
 stocks


go
 to
 zero.
 I
 mean,
 you're
 likely
 not


even
 going
 to
 see
 them
 take
 that
 30
 40%


draw
 downs
 that
 they
 taken
 over
 the
 past


week
 because
 once
 the
 government's
 on


board,
 you
 have
 a
 backs
 stop.
 You
 have
 a


backs
 stop
 by
 the
 government.
 So,
 I


don't
 know.
 Now,
 Sprrowley's
 thoughts
 on


this
 yesterday
 was
 that
 this
 is
 a


perfect
 short
 opportunity
 because
 this


is
 stupid
 and
 that
 uh
 it's
 going
 to
 lead


to
 an
 even
 better
 entry
 to
 people,
 you


know,
 going
 short
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 these


names.
 Again,
 I
 just
 think
 shorting


these
 names
 is
 tough
 because
 you've
 got


to
 be
 so
 right
 about
 the
 narrative
 and


you
 might
 just
 not
 be
 right
 about
 the


narrative.
 But
 it
 is
 kind
 of
 wild
 to
 see


that
 the
 Trump
 administration


theoretically
 could
 take
 uh
 a
 stake
 in


some
 of
 these
 quantum
 companies.
 It
 also


it
 also
 makes
 you
 uh
 you
 know
 it
 also


makes
 you
 wonder
 like
 again
 what
 what
 is


the
 what
 what
 is
 the
 purpose
 of
 the


government
 and
 and
 the
 sort
 of
 venture


capital
 strategy
 because
 I
 can


understand
 it
 when
 it's
 for
 Intel


because
 like
 look
 if
 China
 invades


Taiwan
 we
 need
 our
 new
 chips.
 I
 can


understand
 when
 it's
 for
 rare
 earth


metals
 because
 if
 China
 has
 massive


export
 controls
 we
 have
 to
 have
 our
 own


rare
 earth
 metals.
 At
 what
 point
 does
 it


just
 become
 a
 grift?
 Like
 at
 what
 point


is
 like,
 "Oh,
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 take
 a


stake
 in
 Facebook."
 Now
 it's
 like,


"Well,
 there's
 no
 need
 for
 the


government
 to
 take
 a
 stake."
 Yeah,
 but


the
 government
 wants
 to
 take
 a
 stake.


It's
 like,
 well,
 that
 doesn't
 make


sense.
 I'm
 gonna
 take
 a
 stake
 in
 SoFi.


We
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 secure
 online


banking
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Like,
 at


what
 point
 does
 it
 become
 just
 the


government
 literally
 doing
 whatever
 they


want
 to
 do
 to
 pump
 different
 sectors.


And
 I
 am
 not
 a
 fan
 of
 that.
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 people
 that
 believe
 in
 free


market
 capitalism
 would
 not
 be
 fans
 of


that.
 But,
 nonetheless,
 that
 could
 be


something
 that's
 playing
 out.
 So,
 we're


going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 over
 the
 coming


years
 how
 this
 ends
 up
 happening.
 Very


curious
 to
 see
 when
 the
 market
 opens.


Does
 the
 market
 actually
 believe
 in
 this


story?
 Does
 they
 do
 they
 believe
 in
 this


narrative
 or
 do
 these
 stocks
 end
 up


getting
 hit?


Yeah,
 it's
 a
 ton
 of
 ton
 of
 little
 hanky


panky
 going
 on.
 That's
 for
 sure.
 Ton
 of


hanky
 panky
 that's
 going
 on
 right
 there.


They
 need
 to
 stake
 in
 Beyond
 Meat.


Speaking
 of
 beyond
 meat,
 my
 goodness.


Again,
 if
 you
 bought
 at
 750,
 it
 is
 what


it
 is.
 282
 stock
 went
 up
 300%
 yesterday,


went
 up
 16x
 over
 the
 past
 week,
 and
 now


back
 down
 below
 $3.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 a
 lot


of these
 things
 is
 it's
 just
 part
 of,
 I


guess,
 the
 nature
 of
 how
 some
 of these


bull
 markets
 operate.
 But
 there
 you
 go.


You
 got
 Beyond
 Meat
 down
 21%
 in
 the


pre-markets
 and
 I
 guess
 the
 the
 juice


has
 been
 squeezed
 out
 of
 this
 one
 as
 it


continues
 to
 be
 flat.
 S&P
 500
 6673.


That's
 up
 0
 or
 that's
 basically
 flat


0.01%.


Not
 too
 bad
 on
 the
 S&P
 500.


66772
 and
 that
 is
 now
 up
 just
 a
 little


bit
 right
 there.
 About
 to
 go
 up.
 When
 is


the
 government
 buying
 Bitcoin?
 That's
 a


good
 question.
 That
 is
 also
 why
 the


government
 has
 not
 even
 bought
 Bitcoin


yet.
 Didn't
 Trump
 promise
 the
 strategic


Bitcoin
 reserve,
 but
 they're
 thinking
 of


buying
 quantum.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 it
 it


logically
 does
 not
 make
 sense.
 Someone


tell
 me
 how
 that
 makes
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


get
 it.
 And
 you
 can
 say
 quantum
 is


important
 for
 defense.
 I'm
 like,
 dude,


like
 the
 actual
 defense
 applications


like
 Palenter
 software
 on
 the


battlefield
 I
 think
 has
 a
 little
 bit


more
 of
 an
 implication
 than
 some
 defense


experiments
 in
 quantum.
 So,
 like
 the


fact
 that
 Trump
 ran
 on
 buying
 Bitcoin


and
 we
 have
 not
 bought
 a
 single
 Bitcoin,


but
 we're
 thinking
 of
 putting
 $10


million
 into
 quantum
 stocks
 at
 egregious


valuations.
 I
 mean,
 like
 what
 the


government's
 going
 to
 buy
 in
 at
 a
 $20


billion
 valuation.
 It's
 on
 on on
 a


quantum
 stock
 that
 has
 a
 couple
 million


in
 revenue.
 It's
 it's
 weird.
 It's
 very


very
 weird.
 But
 that
 is
 the
 story
 for


the
 day
 and
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 right


now.
 All right.
 So,
 cool.
 That's
 what
 we


got
 with
 Quantum.
 Let's
 get
 into
 some
 of


these
 other
 stories.
 Uh
 Tesla,
 so
 let's


talk
 about
 it.
 Tesla,
 they
 missed
 on
 the


top
 line.
 They
 beat
 on
 the
 or
 they


missed
 on
 the
 bottom
 line.
 Came
 in
 line


with
 expectations
 on
 the
 top
 line.
 Uh


42215.
 This
 is
 what
 you
 have
 right
 now.


We
 listened
 to
 the
 call
 yesterday,
 me


and
 Steve.
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 an
 okay
 call.


Elon
 was
 a
 bit
 more
 energetic
 than
 he


was
 from
 90
 days
 ago,
 but
 it
 wasn't


necessarily
 that
 different
 in
 terms
 of
 a


lot
 of
 promises
 and
 not
 necessarily
 an


explanation
 on
 how
 they're
 going
 to
 get


there.
 My
 my
 thing
 with
 Tesla
 here
 is


that
 energy
 next
 year,
 even
 if
 it
 if
 it


doubles,
 it
 doesn't
 make
 a
 material


change
 in
 the
 business
 in
 terms
 of
 the


earnings
 growth.
 Uh
 robots
 are
 not


coming
 next
 year.
 In
 fact,
 Elon
 did
 say


that
 the
 production
 for
 Optimus
 is
 going


to
 start
 in
 2026,
 aka
 they're
 going
 to


build
 production
 lines,
 which
 is
 super


bullish,
 but
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 that


Optimus
 is
 going to
 be
 shipped
 in
 any


meaningful
 commercial
 application.
 So,


you're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 Optimus
 growth


in
 2026.
 So,
 the
 only
 thing
 left
 then
 is


vehicle
 deliveries
 and
 FSD.
 Let's
 say


vehicle
 deliveries
 are
 slightly
 up


because
 rates
 come
 down,
 but
 they're
 not


up
 like
 crazy
 because
 the
 EV
 credit
 goes


away.
 The
 only
 other
 vertical
 I
 see
 for


Tesla
 is
 FSD.
 And
 Elon
 did
 talk
 about


FSD
 yesterday
 and
 he
 mentioned
 that
 FSD


is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 reason
 why
 Tesla


continues
 to
 win.
 His
 exact
 quote
 on
 FSD


was
 that
 uh
 here's
 the
 thing.
 The
 simple


killer
 app
 is
 that
 if
 you
 can
 text
 in


the
 car,
 if
 we
 can
 get
 unsupervised
 epic


so
 FSD
 to
 be
 so
 good
 that
 you
 can
 text


and
 drive,
 everyone
 will
 buy
 the
 car.


I'm
 100%
 confident
 we
 can
 make
 this


happen.


Look,
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 important
 to
 be


long
 Tesla
 and
 have
 exposure
 to
 the
 age


of
 physical
 AI.
 I
 just
 logically
 now


that
 it's
 at
 this
 valuation
 don't
 see
 in


2026
 what
 is
 the
 growth
 curve
 that
 can


change
 earnings
 growth.
 Tesla
 is
 growing


negative
 30%
 year-over-year
 and
 it's


trading
 at
 200
 times
 free
 cash
 flow
 and


you
 know
 200
 I
 think
 it's
 145
 times
 PE


like
 and
 the
 multiples
 are
 whatever


right
 Tesla's
 never
 really
 traded
 on


multiples
 but
 the
 point
 is
 this
 is
 not
 a


stock
 that's
 at
 250
 it's
 not
 at
 200
 it's


not
 at
 150
 it's
 not
 even
 at
 300
 it's
 now


at
 422
 and
 it's
 not
 growing
 and
 so
 I


don't
 know
 if
 2026
 is
 the
 year
 where


they
 switch
 to
 growth
 it's
 just
 when
 you


have
 an
 Nvidia
 that's
 growing
 and
 an


Amazon
 that's
 growing
 a
 Google
 that's


growing
 it's
 a
 little
 tough
 to
 bet
 on


something
 that
 already
 has
 such
 a


stretched
 valuation
 and
 stretch
 multiple


that
 is
 not
 showing
 the
 growth.
 I
 mean,


a
 lot of
 these
 growth
 stocks
 that
 are


growing,
 you
 can
 disagree
 with
 the


multiples,
 but
 if
 they're
 actually


growing,
 you
 can
 at least
 say
 they
 can


grow
 into
 the
 valuation.
 Tesla's
 going


to
 really
 have
 to
 put
 up
 some
 numbers
 in


2026
 and
 maybe
 that's
 not
 the
 year.


Maybe
 it's
 27
 and
 you
 just
 have
 to
 be


patient
 with
 it
 in
 order
 to
 get
 that


growth
 rate,
 but
 as
 of
 now,
 that's
 just


not
 there.
 And
 I
 think
 every
 Tesla


investor
 has
 to
 be
 pretty
 honest
 with


with,
 you
 know,
 that
 reality
 of
 what's


happening.
 Nonetheless,
 the
 call
 ended


by
 Elon
 saying,
 "Please
 vote
 for
 the
 the


pay
 package."
 So,
 they
 did
 have
 a
 bit
 of


a
 sales
 pitch
 right
 there.
 I
 think
 he


will
 end
 up
 getting
 that
 vote.
 I
 think


November
 6th
 is
 the
 actual
 shareholder


meeting.
 They
 also
 skipped
 over
 a
 bunch


of
 questions
 that
 people
 cared
 about


like
 future
 products,
 which
 also
 I
 think


pissed
 off
 a
 lot
 of
 shareholders


because,
 you
 know,
 they
 didn't
 really


talk
 about
 the
 stuff
 that
 people
 wanted


to
 to
 hear
 about.
 So,
 it
 was
 a
 it
 was
 eh


quarter
 like
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 It
 wasn't


too
 good,
 wasn't
 too
 great.
 Stocks


relatively
 flat
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 what


a
 lot
 of
 people
 expected
 for
 us
 to
 get


on
 Tesla
 as
 well.
 So,
 that's
 what
 we
 got


with
 Tessy
 down
 about
 3.4%
 right
 here.


in
 the
 pre-markets.
 Did
 you
 see
 WMBBY


last
 night?
 I
 did
 see
 Webby
 last
 night.


I
 almost
 bet
 on
 the
 Spurs,
 but
 I
 ended


up
 not
 betting,
 but
 that
 that
 man,
 I


mean,
 he
 might
 be
 he
 might
 be
 going
 for


might
 be
 going
 for
 MVP.
 He
 might
 be


going
 for
 most
 valuable
 player.
 It's
 a


good
 game.
 I
 didn't
 watch
 all
 of
 it,
 but


I
 saw
 some
 of
 the
 highlights
 and
 I
 was


like,
 damn,
 he
 is
 he
 might
 be
 the
 next


big
 thing
 in
 San
 Antonio.
 All right,
 so


that's
 what
 we
 have
 in
 the
 context
 of


Tesla.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 some
 more
 stuff


we
 have
 in
 the
 macro.
 Actually,
 first,


let's
 do
 Palanteer.
 So,
 Palanteer,
 this


was
 an
 important
 thing
 this
 morning.


Palanteer
 inked
 a
 deal
 with
 200
 million


or
 worth
 200
 million
 uh
 with
 Lumen.
 So,


this
 was
 actually
 a
 really
 uh


interesting
 deal
 because
 when
 I
 went
 to


AIPCON,
 uh
 Palunteer
 had
 a
 similar
 deal


that
 was
 like
 this
 or
 they
 had
 they


talked
 about
 their
 Lumen
 partnership,


but
 now
 we
 actually
 got
 some
 real
 stats


on
 what
 this
 Lumen
 partnership
 look


like.
 By
 the
 way,
 Karp's
 going to
 be
 on


Fox
 News
 today.
 Karp
 is
 going
 to
 be
 on


Fox
 News.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 to
 see


Karp
 live.
 Uh
 this
 is
 a
 week
 before


earnings,
 so
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 really


nice
 to
 see
 him.
 He's
 going
 to be
 on
 the


claimment
 countdown
 at
 3
 pm.
 So
 I
 will


get
 the
 clip
 of
 that
 for
 the
 market


close
 and
 we'll
 get
 into
 what
 he
 had
 to


say.
 But
 here
 are
 some
 details
 from
 the


partnership.
 Luminer
 industry
 leaders


building
 core
 infrastructure
 for
 the
 AI


era
 today
 announced
 a
 multi-year


multi-million
 dollar
 strategic


partnership
 to
 help
 enterprises
 across


every
 industry
 deploy
 AI
 faster
 and
 more


securely
 in
 complex
 multi
 cloud


environments.
 Uh
 CEO
 of
 Lumen
 said


pounce
 or
 freeze
 data
 while
 Lumen
 moves


it.
 Together,
 we're
 uniquely
 positioned


to
 enable
 enterprises
 to
 unlock
 their


ambitions
 with
 unprecedented
 scale
 and


speed.
 And
 then
 you
 had
 Karp
 on
 the


press
 release
 say,
 "Our
 partnership
 with


Lumen
 has
 reached
 new
 heights.
 American


companies
 need
 to
 unlock
 immediate
 value


from
 AI.
 We
 are
 proud
 to
 work
 with
 Lumen


to
 enable
 the
 infrastructure
 and


intelligence
 layers
 for
 our
 customers
 to


become
 AI
 winners.
 Uh
 200
 million.
 So


look,
 uh
 if
 you're
 long
 Palunteer,
 I


think
 more
 and
 more
 of
 these
 commercial


deals
 are
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 operate.


One
 of
 the
 things
 about
 Palanteer
 is


that
 and
 this
 partnership
 with
 Lumen
 is


that
 it's
 going
 to
 have
 downstream


effects
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 third-party


distributors
 and
 vendors
 that
 Lumen


works
 it
 works
 with
 which
 is
 what
 the


press
 release
 was
 going
 into
 and
 so
 this


should
 really
 help
 their
 kind
 of
 go
 to


market
 approach
 in
 regards
 to
 dealing


with
 more
 commercial
 growth
 and
 you
 know


if
 we
 can
 get
 that
 50%
 number
 going
 into


Q3
 I
 do
 think
 the
 stock
 has
 some
 good


room
 to
 potentially
 run.
 I
 did
 buy
 a


little
 bit
 yesterday
 at
 172.38


and
 so
 I
 bought
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 the
 dip


yesterday
 um
 on
 some
 of
 the
 downside


weakness.
 SMCI.
 Are
 we
 moving
 red?
 SMCI.


Whoa.
 5%
 down.
 Okay.
 What's
 happening


with
 SMCI?


Let's
 see
 what
 we've
 got
 here.
 Um,


don't
 see
 the
 news
 right
 now,
 but
 SMCI


Oh,
 I
 don't
 see
 a
 single
 headline.
 Oh.


Oh,
 boy.
 Hold
 on.
 SMCI
 provides.


Is
 this
 earnings
 or
 is
 this
 uh
 No,
 this


is
 not
 earnings.
 This
 is


I
 guess
 they
 had
 earning
 this
 is
 it


looks
 like
 a
 preliminary


update
 for
 the
 first
 quarter.


SMCI.
 Okay.
 So,
 let
 me
 let
 me
 just
 pull


this
 up.
 Um


I
 guess
 it
 is
 no
 no
 their
 earnings
 call


is
 scheduled
 for
 November
 4th,
 but
 they


did
 give
 a
 preliminary
 update.
 Okay,
 so


the
 numbers
 are
 uh
 new
 design
 wins


exceeding
 12
 billion
 for
 2026.
 Q1


revenue
 at
 5
 billion.
 Oh,
 that


misguidance.
 Street
 thought
 6
 to
 7


billion
 came
 in
 at
 5
 billion.
 Delayed
 Q1


revenue
 shifts
 to
 second
 quarter
 due
 to


order
 upgrades.
 Strong
 demand
 seen
 for


Blackwell
 ultra
 GPUs
 and
 liquid
 cooling


solutions.
 Company
 reiterates
 fiscal


year
 2026
 revenue
 target
 of
 at least
 33


billion.
 Earnings
 call
 on
 November
 4th.


Okay,
 so
 they
 missed
 estimates.
 They


missed
 estimates.
 I
 mean,
 it
 looks
 like


they
 got
 it
 for
 six
 to
 seven
 a
 couple


months
 ago
 and
 they
 came
 in
 at
 five


billion.
 Potentially,
 they
 could
 have


missed
 estimates
 for
 a
 good
 reason.
 Aka,


they
 had
 uh
 supply
 chain
 bottlenecks
 on


their
 demand
 because
 they
 are
 saying


they
 do
 have
 strong
 demand.
 But


nonetheless,
 if
 you
 miss
 estimates,


that's
 not
 the
 best
 in
 the
 world.
 There


you
 go,
 SMCI
 right
 there.
 4946.
 Yeah.


What's
 the
 point
 of
 earnings
 then?
 That


is
 kind
 of
 weird.
 SMCI
 has
 done
 this


multiple
 times
 in
 the
 past
 where
 they


give
 these
 like
 preliminary
 results,
 but


they
 don't
 actually
 hold
 the
 earnings.


and
 then
 you
 kind
 of
 get
 that
 type
 of
 a


hit.
 But
 uh
 there
 you
 go.
 Down
 6
 8%
 now


down
 7%.


That
 one
 continuing
 to
 get
 a
 hit.
 Just


guide
 for
 2030
 like
 Oracle
 and
 pump
 it.


Yeah,
 it's
 a
 good
 idea.
 Dude,
 a
 lot
 of


these
 companies
 if
 they
 can
 just
 guide


for
 2030
 and
 say
 they're
 going
 to
 be


okay,
 then
 maybe
 that's
 what
 they
 need


to
 do.
 All
 right,
 so
 that's
 the
 update


you
 got
 from
 SMCI.


Uh,
 looks
 like
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 weakness


right
 there.
 Speaking
 of,
 you
 know,
 just


putting
 out
 press
 releases,
 this
 was
 a


another
 insane
 stat
 from
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal
 yesterday.
 Oracle,
 Nvidia,
 AMD,


and
 Broadcom
 added
 630
 billion
 to
 their


market
 value
 in
 the
 first
 day
 of
 trading


after
 their
 partnership
 announcements


with
 OpenAI.


So
 after
 all
 of
 these
 companies
 which


really
 over
 the
 past
 three
 weeks
 we
 all


witnessed
 these
 uh
 deals
 that
 were


announced
 with
 Oracle
 Nvidia
 AMD
 was


last
 week
 with
 the
 whole
 10%
 of
 AMD


they're
 going
 to
 take
 and
 then
 the


Broadcom
 10
 gigawatt
 deal
 630
 billion
 of


market
 cap
 that
 means
 investors
 were


like
 all
 right
 if
 you
 guys
 are
 going to


work
 with
 open
 eye
 we
 are
 willing
 to


keep
 buying
 your
 stock
 that
 is
 what
 you


saw
 in
 terms
 of
 market
 momentum
 on
 these


names.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 making
 those


partnerships,
 giving
 out
 that
 guidance


for
 the
 long
 term,
 that
 really
 is
 the


formula,
 at least
 so
 far
 in
 terms
 of


these
 stocks
 to
 be
 able
 to
 win,
 and


that's
 what
 we're
 seeing
 right
 now.
 SMCI


right
 there
 down
 8.6%.


On
 the
 day,


that's
 what
 you
 have
 on


SMCI.
 Amit,
 did
 you
 see
 the
 Mike
 Alfred


investment
 into
 open?
 Yes,
 I
 did.
 So,


Mike
 Alfred,
 who
 is
 the
 board
 member
 of


Irene,
 which
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 pe
 a
 lot
 of


you
 guys
 like
 right
 there,
 slightly
 up


in
 the
 pre-markets.
 did
 buy
 Openoro.
 Uh


644,
 I
 believe,
 is
 what
 he
 bought.


210,000
 shares.
 So,


yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I'm
 not
 that


interested
 in
 the
 company.
 I
 would


really
 like
 to
 see
 some
 quarters
 of


execution
 before
 even
 thinking
 of


looking
 at
 the
 investment
 thesis,
 but
 he


did
 buy.
 He
 did
 say
 he
 would
 buy
 if
 it


did
 drop
 25%
 back
 when
 it
 was
 at
 $8.
 So,


you
 know,
 yesterday
 you
 had
 a
 lot
 of


stocks
 take
 a
 dip
 and
 he
 ended
 up


buying.
 So,
 he
 is
 in
 the
 name
 now.
 Open


door
 right
 there
 684.
 That
 is
 slightly


up
 in
 the
 pre-market.
 Why
 is
 AMD


dropping?
 Not
 sure.
 I
 mean,
 AMD
 works


with
 SMCI,
 but
 I
 doubt
 that
 the
 SMCI


miss
 on
 revenue
 is
 a
 reason
 AMD
 would


miss.
 But
 you
 do
 have
 AMD
 right
 there


down
 about
 1.1%.
 Reddit's
 up
 1%.
 Then


Google
 right
 there.36%.


That
 is
 at
 252


as
 well.
 All right,
 so
 that
 is
 we
 got


that
 is
 what
 we
 got
 with
 Google
 again.


Pouncer
 did
 get
 that
 $200
 million
 deal


with
 Lumen.
 Just
 talked
 about
 that.
 Very


good.
 See,
 Karp
 will
 be
 live
 on
 Fox
 News


today
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 uh
 what
 he


has
 to
 say.
 All right,
 so
 let's
 go


through
 some
 other
 stats
 that
 we've
 got


going
 on.
 First
 of
 all,
 remember
 that


big
 crypto
 like
 round
 table
 that
 uh
 the


Fed
 had
 a
 couple
 of
 days
 ago.
 Here's
 uh


what
 Brian
 Armstrong
 had
 to
 say
 about


that
 round
 table
 and
 uh
 basically
 where


crypto
 legislation
 is
 starting
 to
 get
 a


lot
 more
 clarity
 in
 the
 United
 States.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 we
 had
 great
 meetings
 with


the
 Democrats
 on
 in
 the
 Senate
 and
 on


the
 Republican
 side
 today.
 And
 the
 good


news
 is
 that
 there's
 strong
 bipartisan


support
 and
 will
 to
 get
 this
 market


structure
 legislation
 done.
 It's


important
 for
 America
 and
 the
 50
 million


Americans
 who've
 used
 crypto
 want
 to
 see


it
 get
 done.
 And
 so
 one
 date
 we
 heard


floated
 was
 let's
 try
 to
 get
 this
 markup


done
 uh
 before
 Thanksgiving.
 I
 think


that
 there's
 90%
 of
 the
 issues
 are


already
 aligned
 on
 and
 agreed
 and


there's
 draft
 text
 going
 back
 and
 forth.


A
 lot
 of
 great
 crossunctional
 uh


collaboration
 happening
 there.
 That
 last


10%
 are
 the
 remaining
 issues
 and


everyone
 committed
 to
 get
 in
 the
 room


together
 and
 work
 it
 out
 and
 hopefully


we'll
 see
 some
 draft
 text
 or
 get
 it
 out


of
 committee
 by
 Thanksgiving.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 you
 got
 Brian
 Armstrong,
 CEO


of
 Coinbase,
 feeling
 pretty
 damn
 bullish


about
 uh
 the
 legislative
 commitment
 that


the
 United
 States
 will
 be
 able
 to
 take


for
 crypto.
 Yes,
 the
 government
 is
 shut


down
 still.
 This
 is
 the
 22nd
 day
 of
 the


shutdown.
 However,
 they
 did
 have
 that


roundt
 which
 like
 I
 guess
 wasn't
 really


part
 of
 the
 government.
 It
 was
 part
 of


the
 Fed
 even
 though
 the
 Fed
 is
 part
 of


the
 government
 but
 they
 still
 have
 that


shutdown
 or
 they
 still
 have
 that
 roundt


and
 Brian
 Armstrong
 does
 feel
 bullish


that
 there
 can
 be
 some
 updates
 on


crypto.
 Andre
 and
 Horowitz,
 one
 of the


best
 venture
 capital
 firms
 in
 the


country
 did
 put
 out
 their
 state
 of


crypto
 report
 and
 uh
 there
 was
 some


pretty
 interesting
 things
 that
 they
 said


in
 the
 state
 of
 crypto.
 They've
 been


pretty
 big
 crypto
 investors
 for
 a
 while.


Couple
 of
 slides
 I
 wanted
 to
 highlight.


Take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 They
 said
 stable


coins
 have
 officially
 found
 product


market
 fit
 now
 rivaling
 the
 world's


largest
 payment
 networks
 in
 transaction


volume.
 And
 the
 reason
 for
 this
 is


because
 the
 US
 is
 recognizing
 the


strategic
 value
 of
 stable
 coins
 as
 they


can
 become
 a
 top
 holder
 for
 um
 uh
 for


treasuries.
 And
 as
 a
 result
 of
 being,


you
 know,
 a
 massive
 holder
 of


treasuries,
 obviously
 the
 government


would
 be
 interested
 in
 stable
 coins


continuing
 to
 to
 win
 because
 that
 would


reduce
 the
 cost
 of
 borrowing.
 On
 top
 of


that,
 Robin
 Hood
 listed
 Hype
 for
 spot


trading
 today.
 Uh
 Hype
 is
 a
 pretty


important
 cryptocurrency
 in
 the
 crypto


ecosystem.
 It's
 up
 10%
 right
 now
 based


on
 that
 Robin
 Hood
 listing.
 So
 you're


getting
 a
 lot
 more
 listings
 happening
 on


Robin
 Hood
 as
 well.
 Real
 world
 assets


are
 bringing
 traditional
 finance
 and


crypto
 on
 chain.
 30
 billion
 including


corporate
 bonds,
 actively
 managed


strategies,
 government
 debt,
 stocks,


alternative
 funds,
 commodities,
 private


credit
 ex
 private
 credit,
 etc.
 have
 come


on
 chain.
 This
 is
 what
 I
 think
 Vlad
 is


very
 excited
 about
 in
 the
 context
 of


Robnet
 because
 he
 thinks
 if
 we
 get
 a
 lot


more
 real
 world
 assets
 on
 chain
 to
 the


tune
 of
 you
 know
 Larry
 uh
 Larry
 Frink


thinks
 $4.5
 trillion
 could
 end
 up


happening
 uh
 to
 come
 on
 chain
 that
 would


be
 a
 massive
 market
 and
 if
 Robin
 takes


just
 a
 small
 part
 of
 that
 four
 and
 a


half
 trillion
 that
 comes
 on
 chain
 that


would
 be
 a
 massive
 move
 for
 their


ecosystem.
 Speaking
 of
 Robin,
 by
 the


way,
 Kathy
 Wood
 bought
 the
 dip


yesterday.


150,000
 shares
 of
 Hoodie,
 probably
 at


that
 122
 to
 125
 range.
 We
 did
 get
 all


the
 way
 down
 to
 120,
 backed
 up
 to
 about


128
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 today,
 but
 Kathy


Wood
 also
 did
 buy
 the
 dip
 on
 Hoodie.
 I
 I


actually
 spoke
 to
 one
 of
 their
 head


Robin
 Hood
 uh
 fintech
 analysts
 at
 the
 um


at
 the
 Legend
 Summit
 and
 they
 are
 really


bullish
 Hood.
 like
 really
 like
 I've


talked
 to
 him
 multiple
 times
 and
 he's


like
 one
 of
 the
 main
 people
 I
 think
 his


name
 is
 Nick
 that
 like
 convinced
 Kathy


to
 like
 really
 like
 seriously
 look
 at


Hood
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 any
 dip
 that
 they


get
 they
 are
 just
 so
 convinced
 that
 Hood


is
 going to
 win
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 like


the
 global
 financial
 ecosystem
 that
 is


why
 you
 know
 they're
 more
 excited
 to


probably
 continue
 buying
 this
 dip.
 And


the
 last
 slide
 right
 here
 that
 I'll
 show


from
 this
 crypto
 report
 is
 that
 the
 US


has
 advanced
 key
 crypto
 legislation


bringing
 regulatory
 clarity
 to
 the


industry.
 So,
 you've
 got
 just
 a
 lot
 more


clarity,
 especially
 with
 the
 Genius
 Act,


on
 where
 crypto
 is
 going,
 where
 the


application
 of
 crypto
 is
 going.
 You
 have


an
 administration
 that's
 not
 really


scared
 about
 crypto.
 I
 mean,
 Paul


Atkins,
 the
 SEC
 chair,
 is
 nothing
 like


Gary
 Gendzer.
 It's
 a
 literally
 a
 180
 in


terms
 of
 how
 he
 thinks
 about
 the
 market.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 I
 think
 that's
 the


reason,
 at least
 while
 Trump
 is
 in


office,
 to
 have
 some
 type
 of
 exposure
 to


crypto.
 I
 know
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 have


been
 relatively
 flat
 in
 October,
 but


when
 you've
 got
 real
 use
 cases,
 you
 got


real
 world
 applications
 and
 you
 have
 the


government
 that
 is
 supporting
 it,
 which


might
 be
 the
 bull
 case
 for
 quantum
 if


the
 government
 starts
 seriously


supporting
 it,
 you're
 probably
 going
 to


get
 the
 value
 of
 these
 assets
 to
 go
 up


and
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 could
 also
 get
 some


momentum
 in
 some
 of
 the
 crypto


ecosystem.
 So
 that's
 what
 you
 have
 right


there.
 Robin
 Hood
 127.20
 in
 the


pre-markets,
 Palanteer
 right
 there
 174.


Tesla
 still
 down
 3.3%,
 Nvidia
 down


half%,
 then
 the
 S&P
 0.07%
 07%
 down
 on


the
 day.
 SMCI
 still
 getting
 hit.
 H
 a


little
 recovery.
 No,
 it
 was
 down
 nine.


Now
 it's
 down
 three.
 That's
 not
 too
 bad


for
 SMC.
 Wow,
 that
 actually
 it
 went
 from


46
 to
 50.
 So
 if
 you
 stepped
 in
 at
 46,


I
 mean,
 look,
 did
 it
 deserve
 a
 10%
 drop


after
 missing
 revenue?
 Probably
 not.
 If


the
 reason
 they're
 missing
 is
 because
 of


supply
 chain
 issues,
 not
 demand
 issues.


Like
 if
 there's
 a
 demand
 problem,
 then
 a


lot
 of
 the
 semi
 stocks
 are
 going to
 take


a
 hit.
 We
 know
 based
 on
 TSM
 earnings
 and


ASML
 earnings,
 there's
 not
 really
 a


demand
 issue
 that's
 going
 on.
 So
 TSM


right
 there
 below
 300
 as
 well,
 289


slightly
 up
 in
 the
 pre-markets,
 but
 SMCI


getting
 a
 little
 bit


little
 bit
 of
 a
 boost
 there.
 So
 that
 is


what
 you've
 got.
 Circle
 as
 well,
 another


big
 stable
 coin
 company
 that's
 been


making
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 over
 the


past
 week.
 Still
 down
 from
 that
 298
 high


that
 it
 got
 to
 a
 couple
 months
 ago,
 but


up
 3x
 since
 IPO
 125
 in
 the
 pre-markets.


Okay,
 China.
 Let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit


about
 that.
 This
 is
 what
 Jameson
 Greer


said
 on
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 China
 and


essentially
 how
 they
 think
 this


negotiation
 is
 going
 to
 play
 out.


>> So
 in
 Geneva,
 we
 had
 an
 agreement
 where


they
 would
 limit
 their
 rare
 earth
 export


controls.
 they'd
 keep
 their
 retaliatory


tariffs
 down
 and
 we
 would
 suspend
 a
 good


portion
 of
 our
 our
 tariffs
 uh
 on
 the


reciprocal
 tariff.
 And
 so
 we
 we
 kept
 our


part.
 We
 kept
 that
 tariff
 low
 and
 we
 had


very
 cordial
 and
 constructive


discussions
 over
 the
 summer
 and
 then


again
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 ago
 the
 Chinese


decided
 they
 were
 just
 going
 to
 go
 ahead


and
 expand
 those
 controls
 on
 rare
 earths


again
 not
 not
 on
 just
 us
 but
 on
 on
 the


whole
 world.
 And
 now
 you
 hear
 a
 lot
 of


narratives
 uh
 from
 the
 Chinese
 side
 of


their
 surrogates
 saying
 well
 you
 know


the
 the
 Americans
 have
 put
 a
 lot
 of


controls
 on
 us
 over
 the
 past
 few
 years


or
 they
 put
 out
 a
 new
 rule
 that
 would


you
 know
 to
 to
 avoid
 evasion
 of
 US


export
 controls
 that
 they
 didn't
 like
 or


their
 fees
 on
 ships.
 So
 they're
 trying


out
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 u
 narratives
 when


the
 reality
 is
 they
 just
 want
 to
 exert


economic
 control
 on
 the
 world.
 They


started
 in
 April
 with
 the
 rare
 earth


magnets.
 They're
 using
 every
 anything


else
 that
 has
 happened
 as
 a
 pretext.
 The


reality
 is
 we
 made
 a
 promise
 in
 May
 to


keep
 our
 reciprocal
 tariff
 on
 them
 at


10%.
 We
 kept
 that
 promise
 and
 they
 have


not
 kept
 theirs.


Okay.
 So
 obviously
 tensions
 are
 a
 bit


high
 in
 regards
 to
 the
 USChina
 relations


on
 these
 rare
 export
 or
 rare
 earth


export
 controls.
 Again,
 Trump
 has
 been


deescalating
 to
 an
 extent
 over
 the
 past


couple
 days,
 but
 that
 meeting
 in
 South


Korea
 really
 is
 going
 to
 set
 the
 tone


for
 if
 we
 can
 get
 to
 a
 reasonable
 deal.


And
 you
 know,
 tensions
 with
 China
 are


not
 the
 best,
 but
 also
 tensions
 with


Russia.
 Russia
 just
 escalated
 yesterday


as
 we
 have
 now
 sanctioned
 two
 of
 the


biggest
 oil
 companies
 in
 Russia.


>> Today
 is
 a
 very
 big
 day
 in
 terms
 of
 uh


what
 we're
 doing.
 Look,
 these
 are


tremendous
 sanctions.
 These
 are
 very


big.
 Those
 are
 against
 their
 two
 big
 oil


companies.
 And
 we
 hope
 that
 they
 won't


be
 on
 for
 long.
 We
 hope
 that
 uh
 the
 war


will
 be
 settled.
 uh
 we
 just
 answered
 uh


having
 to
 do
 with
 the
 various
 forms
 of


missiles
 and
 everything
 else
 that
 we're


looking
 at,
 but
 we
 don't
 think
 that's


going
 to
 be
 necessary.
 Uh
 we
 would
 like


to
 see
 them
 just
 take
 the
 line
 that
 has


been
 formed
 over
 quite
 a
 long
 period
 of


time
 and
 go
 and
 let's,
 you
 know,
 go


home.
 Uh
 last
 week
 they
 had
 almost
 8,000


soldiers
 killed.
 Many
 Russians
 were


killed
 last
 week.
 Many
 Ukrainians
 were


killed
 last
 week.
 We
 think
 it's


ridiculous
 and
 would
 like
 to
 have
 it
 in.


Today
 is
 a
 very
 big
 day
 in
 terms
 of


>> so
 as
 a
 result
 of
 sanctioning
 the
 oil


companies
 in
 Russia,


uh
 oil
 prices
 are
 up
 6%.
 This
 is
 uh
 one


of
 the
 biggest
 one-day
 moves
 or
 at least


early
 morning
 moves
 that
 we've
 seen
 on


oil
 and
 uh
 it's
 quite
 incredible
 because


you
 know
 oil
 below
 60
 in
 and
 of
 itself


was
 like
 you
 know
 generally
 really
 good


for
 the
 economy,
 really
 good
 for
 gas


prices,
 all
 that
 stuff.
 Uh
 but
 the
 fact


that
 it's
 back
 up
 now
 again
 Trump
 said


the
 sanctions
 might
 be
 temporary
 and
 the


you
 know
 oil
 might
 or
 the
 oil
 the
 oil


situation
 with
 Russia
 might
 be
 resolved


if
 they
 get
 to
 a
 ceasefire
 or
 at least


end
 the
 war.
 Same
 thing
 that
 you
 know
 he


kind
 of
 said
 with
 Modi
 that
 Modi
 would


stop
 buying
 oil
 until
 the
 war
 is


officially
 done
 with
 Russia
 and
 Ukraine.


But
 nonetheless
 it
 is
 spiking
 up
 oil


prices.
 That's
 not
 necessarily
 the
 best


thing
 going
 into
 Q4
 earnings
 because
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 a
 lot
 of these
 oil


prices
 directly
 affect
 the
 input
 costs


for
 a
 variety
 of
 companies
 and
 you
 know


that
 could
 affect
 their
 margins,
 but


it's
 still
 pretty
 reasonable
 at
 62
 if


even
 if
 it's
 not
 58.
 Now,
 if
 we
 get
 a


spike
 up
 to
 70
 where
 we
 were
 eight


months
 ago,
 that
 would
 be
 a
 little
 bit


different.
 But
 you
 do
 have
 oil
 that
 is


green.
 SMCI
 with
 a
 pretty
 amazing


recovery
 right
 here.
 I
 mean,
 again,


barely
 down
 based
 on
 these
 projections.


I
 I
 would
 chalk
 it
 up
 to
 the
 fact
 that


they
 said
 it's
 a
 supply
 issue,
 not
 a


demand
 issue,
 and
 that's
 why
 the
 street


had
 a
 knee-jerk
 reaction,
 and
 now
 it's


starting
 to
 recover.
 Um,
 but
 if
 you


stepped
 in
 at
 that
 dip
 at
 46,


you
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 momentum.
 Dick


says
 it
 could
 also
 create
 inflation.


Yeah,
 it
 could
 also
 cause
 a
 little
 bit


more
 inflation.
 And
 given
 that
 inflation


has
 been
 steadily
 coming
 down,
 oil


prices
 going
 up
 wouldn't
 necessarily


help.
 Now,
 here's
 the
 median
 forecast


for
 the
 CPI
 report
 that
 we're
 going to


get
 tomorrow.
 Again,
 we
 are
 getting
 CPI


on
 a
 Friday.
 We
 usually
 never
 get
 it
 on


a
 Friday,
 but
 the
 government's
 shut


down,
 so
 we're
 kind
 of
 making
 an


exception
 here.
 The
 median
 forecast
 is


3.1%.


And
 core
 is
 also
 at
 3.1%.
 So,
 we
 should


be
 expecting
 a
 threehandle
 on
 inflation.


Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 I


think
 we
 were
 at
 just
 2.8
 last
 time,
 so


it
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 an
 increase,
 but
 overall,


if
 the
 street
 is
 expecting
 it,
 that


shouldn't
 be
 the
 worst
 thing
 in
 the


world.
 I
 do
 not
 think
 a
 high
 CPI
 or
 a


hot
 CPI
 is
 going
 to
 stop
 anything
 in
 the


context
 of
 the
 Fed.
 I
 think
 the
 Fed
 is


going
 to
 continue
 to


do
 what
 they
 have
 to
 do.
 If
 you
 look
 at


the
 probabilities
 for
 a
 federal
 rate
 cut


going
 into
 October,
 which
 it's
 coming


up,
 folks,
 October
 29th,
 it's
 going
 to


happen
 in
 6
 days,
 you're
 at
 98.9%.


These
 rates
 are
 coming
 down.


And
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 quite
 frankly,


that's
 the
 reason
 why
 the
 tenure
 has


been
 doing
 what
 it's
 doing.
 Yesterday
 we


closed
 below
 3
 point
 uh
 below
 4.0
 again.


We
 are
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 in
 the


pre-markets
 but
 it's
 been
 two
 days
 of
 a


10-year
 that's
 basically
 stayed
 below


four
 which
 is
 pretty
 incredible
 to
 see.


Now
 the
 price
 of
 gold
 is
 up
 right
 here


2.28%.
 So
 you're
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of


a
 move
 back
 in
 gold.
 Now
 some
 of
 these


gold
 targets
 have
 also
 been
 quite


incredible.
 JP
 Morgan
 put
 out
 a
 new


report
 this
 morning
 and
 they
 said,
 "We


believe
 gold
 prices
 could
 exceed
 $8,000


an
 ounce
 by
 2028
 as
 investors


increasingly
 use
 it
 as
 a
 hedge
 for


equity
 risk,
 which
 would
 make
 gold
 a,


you
 know,
 $60
 trillion
 asset
 over
 the


next
 three
 years."


So,


I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know,
 you
 know,
 gold
 got


rid
 of
 2.5
 trillion
 over
 the
 past
 couple


days.
 Now,
 it's
 starting
 to
 recover.
 You


know,
 maybe
 the
 silver
 commodity
 copper


trade
 is
 just
 taking
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


breather,
 just
 like
 the
 momentum
 stocks


took
 a
 little bit
 of
 a
 breather.
 Where


is
 Oaklo
 in
 the
 pre-markets?
 Oaklo,


yeah,
 Oaklo
 is
 still
 down.
 I
 mean,
 these


quantum
 names
 probably
 would
 continue
 to


be
 taking
 a
 hit
 in
 the
 pre-market
 if
 it


wasn't
 for
 that
 Wall
 Street
 Journal


update
 that
 we
 got
 yesterday.
 Uh,
 for


those
 that
 are
 just
 joining,
 the
 Trump


administration
 is
 thinking
 of
 taking


equity
 stakes
 in
 some
 of
 these
 quantum


stocks.
 But
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 other
 momentum


names
 are
 not
 really
 getting
 that
 much


love.
 Big
 Bear
 is
 still
 stuck
 below


seven
 bucks.
 Oaklo
 still
 down.3%
 uh
 down


from
 you
 know
 was
 at
 150
 on
 Monday.
 So


again
 we're
 gonna
 have
 to
 really
 see
 if


those
 names
 can
 recover
 or
 are
 they


going
 to
 continue
 to
 be
 stock?
 The
 rare


earth
 names
 getting
 a
 little bit
 of
 love


in
 the
 premarket.
 CRML
 is
 still
 down
 but


MP's
 up
 a
 little bit.
 US
 is
 up
 a
 little


and
 then
 TMQ
 is
 up
 about
 2%
 as
 well.
 Is


Oakllo
 a
 quantum
 stock?
 Oaklo
 is
 not
 a


quantum
 stock.
 It
 is
 a
 nuclear
 energy


stock
 but
 maybe
 if
 they
 add
 quantum
 to


it
 that
 helps
 as
 well.
 Uh,
 Amazon.
 Let's


talk
 about
 Amazon.
 So,
 Amazon
 right
 here


trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 220.
 We
 do
 have


some
 updates
 on
 Amazon.
 Uh,
 as
 we
 try
 to


get
 into
 their
 earnings
 and
 see
 what


will
 happen.
 Amazon
 introduced
 a
 new
 AI


tool
 called
 Help
 Me
 Decide
 this
 morning.


It
 will
 analyze
 your
 browser
 history
 and


preferences
 to
 recommend
 the
 right


product
 for
 you
 with
 just
 one
 tap.


So,
 you've
 got
 Amazon
 creating
 even


more,
 I
 guess,
 intuitive
 ways
 to
 kind
 of


guess
 what
 you're
 doing.
 It's
 called


Help
 Me
 Decide
 AI,
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right


there.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 Let's
 I
 don't


think
 I've
 ever
 asked
 this
 question,
 but


put
 in
 the
 chat,
 how
 many
 times
 do
 you


buy
 from
 Amazon
 a
 month?
 Like,
 if
 you


had
 to
 guess,


I
 would
 say
 for
 me
 it's
 at least
 once
 a


month.
 At least
 once
 a
 month,
 there's


something
 I
 probably
 have
 to
 order.
 For


my
 mom,
 it's
 probably
 like,
 you
 know,


there's
 what,
 30
 days
 in
 a
 month.
 She


probably
 does
 like
 what
 600
 times
 a


month.
 So,
 it's
 like
 two
 per
 day
 or
 or


uh
 100
 per
 day,
 something
 like
 that.
 50


per
 day.
 Like
 she
 she
 she she
 finds
 a


way
 to
 make
 sure
 it's
 Christmas
 every


morning
 or
 every
 afternoon
 when
 we
 get
 a


package.
 Wow,
 look
 at
 this.
 12
 to
 15,


30,
 20.
 My
 girlfriend
 every
 other
 day,


of
 course.
 Six,
 seven.
 Why
 not?
 Why
 not?


Four
 to
 five,
 two
 to
 three.
 My
 daughter


usually
 five
 maybe.
 I
 mean,
 like
 this
 is


another
 one
 of
 my
 bull
 cases
 for
 Amazon.


It's like
 this
 company
 is
 not
 going


anywhere.
 Any
 incremental
 increase
 in


margin,
 you
 are
 going
 to
 see
 uh
 the


stock
 have
 billions
 and
 billions
 of


dollars
 of
 more
 net
 income
 because
 all


of
 us
 just
 continue
 to
 buy
 and
 use


Amazon.
 Like
 it's
 it's
 the
 nature
 of
 how


we
 engage
 with
 the
 company.
 So
 Amazon


right
 there
 at
 218.


Yeah.
 I
 mean
 so
 many
 so
 many
 of
 people


saying
 that
 they
 use
 it
 three
 Wow.
 Doug


says
 three
 or
 four
 times
 a
 day.


Look,
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 if
 and
 they


can
 make
 it
 even
 more
 intuitive
 for


people
 to
 use
 Amazon
 by
 like
 having
 AI


actually
 assist
 in
 the
 product
 adoption.


Yeah,
 that's
 not
 going
 anywhere.
 On
 top


of
 that,
 Morgan
 Stanley
 came
 out


yesterday
 and
 said,
 "Hey,
 we
 think,


remember
 that
 headline
 two
 days
 ago
 that


Amazon's
 trying
 to
 replace
 600,000


workers
 over
 the
 next
 four
 or
 five


years."
 Morgan
 Stanley
 says
 that's
 going


to
 save
 them
 $4
 billion
 in
 annual


savings
 through
 2027
 or
 by
 2027
 because


they're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 to
 be
 paying


humans
 and
 they
 will
 have
 where
 a
 lot


more
 warehouse
 robotics
 uh
 expansion
 and


as
 a
 result
 even
 if
 they
 might
 hire
 more


people
 the
 people
 that
 they're
 going
 to


not
 have
 to
 use
 because
 of
 the
 robotics


automation
 is
 going to
 save
 them
 $4


billion.
 I
 mean
 could
 you
 imagine
 a


company
 that
 doesn't
 have
 the
 best


margins
 at
 12.4%
 4%
 operating
 margins
 to


say
 $4
 billion
 a
 year.
 And
 imagine


that's
 the
 worst
 it's
 going to
 be.


Imagine
 by
 2030
 that's
 like
 10
 billion
 a


year,
 right?
 As
 robotics
 gets
 better
 and


better.
 Like
 this
 is
 a
 massive
 story
 in


margin
 expansion
 and
 cost
 cutting
 led
 by


innovation
 via
 AI
 and
 robotics.
 And


there's
 just
 not
 that
 many
 companies


that
 are
 positioned
 that
 have
 people


buying
 stuff
 seven
 times
 a
 day
 from


their
 website
 like
 an
 Amazon.
 You
 know,


that's
 why
 it
 continues
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 more


bullish
 for
 what
 we're
 seeing
 on
 Amazon.


Benny
 says
 it's
 going to
 be
 way
 more.


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 it
 probably
 will
 be
 a
 lot


more.
 Rile
 says,
 "I
 work
 in
 science
 team


for
 designing
 Amazon
 US
 supply
 chain


network
 and
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 that
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 buying
 every
 day."
 I
 wonder


how
 many
 people
 are
 using
 Amazon's


website


like
 if
 we
 what's
 the
 average
 of
 every


minute
 of
 every
 or
 every
 hour
 like
 every


hour
 just
 in
 the
 United
 States
 how
 many


people
 are
 on
 the
 website?
 Don't
 they


have
 these
 stats?
 How
 many
 Hold
 on,
 let


me
 let
 me
 How
 many
 orders
 does
 Amazon


get
 per
 hour?
 I
 feel
 like
 they
 disclosed


this
 stuff
 a
 year
 ago.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 So,
 it
 is


Wow.
 On
 an
 average
 hour.
 Okay.
 Average


hour
 for
 Amazon.
 536,000


orders.


During
 days
 like
 Prime
 Day,
 5.1
 million


per
 hour
 was
 in
 2024.


That
 is
 wild,
 bro.
 That
 is
 530,000.


That
 means
 in
 the
 next
 hour
 530
 product


530,000
 products
 on
 average
 are
 going
 to


be
 bought
 on
 Amazon.


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 it
 is
 pretty
 incredible
 and


again
 the
 scope
 and
 scale
 of
 the
 size
 of


that
 business
 that's
 not
 going
 anywhere.


So
 look,
 I
 continue
 to
 believe
 it's


undervalued,
 but
 they're
 going
 to
 have


to
 put
 up
 some
 really
 good
 results
 to


get
 the
 street
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 more
 excited.


Uh
 American
 Airlines,
 they
 had
 earnings.


United
 Airlines
 crushed
 it.
 Delta


Southwest
 crushed
 it.
 Here's
 what
 we
 got


on
 American
 Airlines,
 and
 it
 should
 give


us
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 take
 in
 terms


of
 the
 consumer
 and
 what's
 going
 on
 with


travel.


Airlines
 reporting
 a
 smaller
 than


expected
 loss
 of
 17
 cents
 a
 share.
 That


compares
 with
 the
 street
 expecting
 a


loss
 of
 28
 cents
 a
 share,
 revenue
 of


13.69
 billion,
 just
 a
 smidge
 higher
 than


the
 street.
 But
 then
 when
 you
 look
 at


the
 numbers
 within
 the
 numbers,
 there


was
 nothing
 to
 write
 home
 about
 with


this
 quarter
 due
 to
 operational
 issues


and
 weather
 in
 July.
 They
 didn't
 swing


to
 positive
 unit
 revenue
 until


September.
 As
 a
 result,
 revenue
 per
 seat


mile
 in
 the
 third
 quarter
 down
 1.9%.


Cost
 per
 seat
 mile
 up
 3.9%.


Pre-tax
 margin
 negative
 1%.
 And
 all
 of


the
 segments
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 revenue
 in


the
 quarter,
 they
 were
 negative


year-over-year.
 Domestic.


>> So
 American
 Airlines
 not
 the
 best


earnings.
 Dude,
 how
 do
 we
 have
 two


minutes
 until
 the
 market
 opens?
 This
 was


the
 fastest
 fastest
 pre-market.
 Like
 I
 I


did
 like
 did
 we
 just
 yap
 away
 40


minutes?
 I
 didn't
 even
 notice.
 All


right,
 we
 got
 the
 market
 open
 in
 two


minutes,
 but
 American
 Airlines
 not
 the


best
 earnings
 nonetheless.
 The
 stock
 is


up
 uh
 because
 the
 street
 is
 okay
 with
 at


least
 some
 of
 the
 headline
 numbers.
 As


you
 can
 see
 right
 there,
 American


Airlines
 up
 5.2%
 on
 the
 day.
 IBM
 is
 down


big.
 Their
 consulting
 revenue
 was
 down.


That
 stock
 down
 8%.
 IBM
 is
 one
 of
 the


bigger
 players
 in
 quantum
 computing.
 So,


the
 fact
 that
 they're
 down
 8%,
 but


there's
 all
 this
 quantum
 excitement
 in


the
 broader
 investing
 ecosystem
 is
 kind


of
 weird.
 But,
 nonetheless,
 it's
 kind
 of


ironic
 when
 you
 actually
 have
 to
 put
 up


real
 numbers
 and
 you
 miss
 against
 your


numbers,
 the
 stock
 goes
 down.
 When
 you


don't
 put
 up
 any
 numbers,
 the
 stock
 can


go
 up,
 but
 you
 know,
 IBM
 taking
 a
 hit


right
 there
 down
 about
 8%
 and
 we're


going to
 see
 if
 that
 can
 recover.
 Nvidia


0.01%
 at
 180.
 And
 then
 Nvidia
 or
 Tesla


at
 420,
 that's
 down
 about
 4.3%.
 We
 got


about
 a
 minute
 until
 the
 market
 opens.


Last
 quick
 stat
 before
 we
 get
 into
 it.


Uh,
 buybacks,
 folks.
 They're
 coming


back.
 Buyback
 authorization


announcements
 have
 risen
 16%


year-over-year
 to
 a
 record
 1.15


trillion.
 This
 is
 the
 second
 consecutive


yearly
 increase
 since
 the
 2020
 low.


Share
 or
 purchase
 authorizations
 have


more
 than
 tripled.
 Goldman
 Sachs
 is


warning
 that
 watch
 out
 for
 November


because
 right
 now
 it's
 in
 a
 blackout


period,
 but
 uh
 because
 companies
 have


earnings
 coming
 up.
 But
 in
 November,


they're
 expecting
 a
 record
 amount
 of


buybacks,
 over
 a
 hundred
 billion
 in
 one


month
 to
 end
 out
 Q4
 and
 to
 end
 out
 2025.


That
 could
 be
 a
 really
 good
 setup.
 I


mean,
 stocks
 going
 down,
 a
 lot
 of
 these


companies
 being
 like,
 "Hey,
 we
 have
 to


buy
 back
 our
 stock
 anyway
 before
 the
 end


of
 the
 year.
 Our
 stock
 is
 way
 cheaper


than
 it
 was
 back
 in
 August
 and


September.
 Let's
 buy
 the
 dip."
 And
 that


could
 be
 a
 massive
 tailwind
 for
 the


markets
 as
 well
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 keep


an
 eye
 on
 as
 we
 get
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.
 All
 right,
 here
 we
 go.
 Thank


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 It
 is


Thursday,
 October
 23rd,
 9:30
 a.m.
 The


stock
 market


is
 now
 open.


All
 right,
 wake
 your
 ass
 up.


Unfortunately,
 Tessy
 getting
 hit
 right


here.
 Down
 about
 5%.
 418.
 There's
 the


red
 candle.
 It
 was
 at
 447
 yesterday.
 Uh


missed
 on
 EPS.
 They
 came
 in
 line
 with


expectations
 on
 revenue.
 Let's
 see
 if


people
 step
 in
 and
 buy
 the
 dip
 or
 if


this
 one
 continues
 to
 take
 a
 bit
 of
 a


hit.
 Palinger
 goes
 green
 with
 that
 $200


million
 contract
 that
 they
 announced


with
 Lumen
 Technologies
 today.
 Hoodie


12841.
 Let's
 see
 if
 Hood
 can
 get
 back
 up


to
 130.
 Kathy
 Wood
 did
 buy
 the
 dip
 of


about
 150,000
 shares
 yesterday.
 S&P
 goes


green
 668.
 Not
 too
 bad
 on
 the
 S&P
 500.


Nvidia
 right
 there
 18050.
 That's
 up


0.13%.
 SoFi
 that's
 up
 half
 a
 percent


27.40.
 I
 did
 buy
 my
 500
 shares
 of
 SoFi.


Average
 is
 26.88.


So
 you
 guys
 can
 stop
 asking
 me
 to
 buy


SoFi
 before
 earnings
 because
 I
 bought


it.
 I'm
 in.
 We're
 either
 going
 to
 bag


hold
 or
 we're
 either
 going
 to
 ride
 it


higher.
 But
 SoFi
 right
 there
 2730.


That's
 green.
 Grabby
 Grab
 that's
 up
 1%


567.
 Google
 25375


that's
 green.
 Amazon
 218
 that's
 green.


Salesforce
 is
 up.
 Meta's
 up.
 PayPal's


up.
 ELF
 is
 up.
 Apple's
 up.
 SMCI
 still


down
 based
 on
 those
 preliminary
 earnings


that
 they
 gave
 on
 the
 missed


expectations
 of
 revenue,
 but
 it
 was
 down


a
 lot
 worse.
 It
 was
 at
 46.
 So
 rebounded


here
 back
 up
 to
 51
 uh50.
 BMR,
 are
 we


going
 down?
 We
 hit
 47
 yesterday
 on
 this.


So,
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 rebound
 at


48.22,
 but
 it
 was
 a
 pretty
 nasty
 day


yesterday
 for
 BMR.
 Ethereum
 right
 there


stuck
 at
 3,800.
 Then
 Bitcoin
 at
 109.


Bitcoin
 was
 at
 106
 yesterday.
 So,
 that


also
 get
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 uh


rebound.
 Nebas,
 I
 do
 still
 have
 my
 98


put
 that
 expires
 tomorrow.
 Maybe
 I
 don't


get
 assigned.
 Nebas
 right
 there
 at
 100.


That's
 up
 2%.
 So,
 tomorrow
 if
 it
 stays


above
 98,
 we're
 going to
 see
 if
 I
 get


assigned
 or
 not.
 Apploving
 that's
 up


half
 a
 percent.
 Circle
 goes
 red.


Pinterest
 is
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 PaloAlto


is
 up
 a
 little
 bit,
 about
 half
 a


percent.
 Where
 is
 Rocket
 Lab?
 That
 is


green
 1.1%.
 How
 about
 AS


did
 lose
 that
 $100
 level.
 It's
 at
 72.
 Um


B
 Riley
 did
 upgrade
 AS
 to
 90
 today.
 So,


or
 I
 think
 it
 was
 95.
 So,
 they
 did
 get


an
 upgrade
 this
 morning.
 The
 essential


thesis
 of
 the
 upgrade
 was
 increased


revenue
 growth
 potential
 on
 their


existing
 partnerships
 with


telecommunication
 companies.
 Uh,
 but
 the


stock
 right
 here
 slowed
 down
 from
 that


$100
 level
 that
 it
 hit
 a
 couple
 weeks


ago.
 7241
 on
 AS.
 Uber
 right
 here
 up
 1%.


Nvidia
 goes
 red,
 basically
 flat.
 I
 did


buy
 Nvidia
 yesterday
 for
 the
 first
 time


in
 a
 long
 time.
 17750


was
 the
 price
 I
 got
 yesterday.
 Um,


haven't
 bought
 since
 159
 on
 Nvidia.
 So,


it
 was
 small
 buy.
 And,
 you
 know,
 the


idea
 is
 going
 into
 earnings.
 I
 think


it'll
 be
 a
 strong
 earnings.
 I
 don't


think
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 China
 revenue


though.
 So,
 you
 know,
 the
 street's
 going


to
 have
 to
 overlook
 the
 lack
 of
 China


revenue.


We
 were
 just
 at
 195.
 I
 think
 any
 move


back
 up
 to
 the
 190s
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


year
 wouldn't
 be
 too
 bad.
 Google
 right


there
 252.
 Reddit
 that's
 up
 2.4%.
 Then


you
 got
 PayPal
 again
 that's
 up
 1.4%.


Serve
 Robotics
 that
 is
 green
 on
 the
 day


up
 about
 1%.
 What
 about
 Rivian?
 How
 is


that
 one
 doing?
 Rivian
 down.
 Not
 really


reacting
 too
 much
 to
 Tesla
 earnings.


Tesla
 getting
 hit.
 417
 still
 down


4.7%.


4.7%


on
 Tessie.
 Trump
 will
 be
 making
 an


announcement
 at
 3
 PM
 today.
 Trump
 will


be
 making
 announcement
 at
 3
 PM
 today.


Not
 sure
 exactly
 what
 he's
 going
 to
 be


talking
 about,
 but
 he
 will
 be
 making


announcement.
 Maybe
 it's
 about
 the


shutdown.
 I
 mean,
 we're
 22
 days
 in.


Maybe
 that
 changes,
 but
 could
 be
 on
 the


shutdown.
 Let's
 look
 at
 some
 of
 the
 high


momentum
 names.
 Oaklo


down
 2.7.
 Again,


Oaklo
 has
 been
 down
 every
 single
 day


this
 week.
 It
 continues
 to
 get
 hit.
 How


about
 the
 quantum
 stocks
 after
 that
 Wall


Street
 Journal
 announcement?
 D-Wave
 up


14%,
 NQ
 up
 5%
 and
 Regetti


up
 7%.
 So
 again,
 the
 Trump


administration,
 Wall
 Street
 Journal


reported
 yesterday
 thinking
 of
 taking


equity
 stakes
 on
 these
 companies.
 You


had
 some
 senior
 officials
 come
 out
 and


say
 we
 are
 not
 negotiating
 with
 these


companies
 for
 an
 equity
 stake,
 but
 the


market
 doesn't
 care.
 The
 headline
 alone


is
 enough
 to
 get
 these
 stocks
 to
 get


higher.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 the
 shorts
 are


really
 getting
 hit
 if
 you
 did
 go
 short


over
 the
 past
 couple
 days
 based
 on
 this


announcement.
 But
 those
 stocks
 continue


to
 go
 green.
 Big
 Bear
 AI,
 that
 stock
 is


at
 665,
 basically
 flat.
 How
 about


Nanuclear?
 That
 one
 is
 up
 about
 1%.
 SMR,


that
 one
 is
 down
 on
 the
 day.
 And
 then


MP,
 some
 of
 the
 rare
 earth
 stocks


continue
 to
 go
 down
 as
 well,
 relatively


flat,
 but
 that
 one
 below
 $70.
 Where
 is


Beyond
 Meat?
 Are
 we
 still
 above
 three?


We
 are
 at
 291.
 Down
 18%.
 It
 was
 at
 850


at
 one
 point
 in
 the
 pre-markets


yesterday.
 stayed
 at
 six
 bucks,
 got
 a


halted
 seven
 times,


and
 now
 it's
 back
 down
 to
 280.
 Oscar
 is


getting
 hit,
 unfortunately,
 because
 of


Molina
 Health.
 So,
 Oscar
 down
 7%
 right


there.
 Molina
 had
 a
 crappy
 quarter.


There's
 there's
 no
 ifands
 or
 buts
 about


it.
 Down
 20%
 on
 the
 day.
 Why
 was
 it


crappy?
 As
 you
 can
 see
 on
 that
 red


candle
 right
 there,
 well,
 they
 decreased


guidance.
 And
 it
 didn't
 even
 really
 have


to
 do
 with
 Medicaid
 or
 ACA
 subsidies.
 It


had
 to
 do
 with
 some
 other
 parts
 of
 their


business
 that
 technically
 shouldn't


really
 affect
 Oscar,
 but
 because
 it's
 in


the
 same
 sector,
 you
 know,
 Oscar
 is


going to
 get
 hit.
 Same
 thing
 with
 UNH.


But
 if
 you're
 in
 Molina,
 CNC,
 all
 those


healthcare
 companies
 and
 you
 know,


you're
 getting
 a
 relatively
 red
 day


across
 the
 board.
 And
 that's
 just
 part


of
 it.
 These
 are
 some
 of
 the
 healthcare


stocks.
 Yeah,
 look
 at
 them.
 I
 mean,
 you


have
 two
 names
 that
 are
 red.
 HCA
 and


Cardinal,
 Teldoc,
 Molina,
 Clover,


Humanana,
 even
 Tempest,
 CVS,
 UNH,
 Oscar,


UNH
 down
 almost
 2%.
 Elements,
 all
 these


guys,
 and
 HIMS
 47.26,


those
 are
 also
 red.
 Now,
 Lending
 Club


had
 a
 great
 earnings.
 They
 beat
 on
 the


top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 revenue
 is
 going
 up


30%.
 Uh
 that's
 up
 14%
 on
 the
 day.
 I


think
 this
 is
 your
 biggest
 bull
 flag
 for


SoFi.
 I
 mean,
 if
 Lending
 Club
 is
 putting


up
 numbers
 like
 this,
 we
 know
 that
 SoFi


is
 going
 to
 put
 up
 some
 pretty
 good


numbers
 and
 their
 underwriting
 is
 going


to
 be
 pretty
 good
 as
 well.
 So,
 you
 know,


that
 bull
 argument
 for
 can
 SoFi
 really


get
 the
 $35


bump
 after
 good
 earnings.


Maybe
 that
 would
 happen.
 Open
 Door,


where
 is
 Open
 Door?
 What
 do
 we
 have


going
 on?
 Open
 Door
 is
 up
 3.3%
 707.
 Open


door
 going
 green
 again.
 A
 lot
 of
 these


hardcore
 momentum
 names,
 they
 did
 get


hit
 pretty
 hard
 over
 the
 past
 like
 two


weeks
 at
 this
 point.


So
 maybe
 they
 bottom
 and
 maybe
 you
 get


some
 people
 stepping
 in.
 Maybe
 they


don't
 go
 back
 to
 all-time
 highs,
 but


they
 do
 at
 least
 not
 get
 hit
 as
 bad
 as


they
 were
 uh
 over
 the
 past
 two
 weeks


or
 they
 potentially
 just
 stabilize,
 make


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 run
 higher
 and
 then


continue
 to
 get
 hit
 with
 the
 momentum


draw
 down.
 So
 we're
 going to
 have
 to


keep
 an
 eye
 on
 them.
 It
 opened
 right


there.
 Was
 up
 2.7%.
 S&P
 goes
 green.


66880.


66880


on
 the
 S&P.
 Ethereum
 trying
 to
 push
 for


it.
 Continuing
 3864.


This
 one
 has
 just
 been
 stuck
 below
 4,000


ever
 since
 the
 Truth
 Social
 China
 post.


That
 that's
 what
 really
 wrecked
 Ethereum


and
 then
 it
 hasn't
 been
 able
 to
 really


recover
 since.
 So,
 you
 know,
 getting


back
 above
 4,000
 would
 be
 nice.
 SMCI


right
 there
 at
 4%
 still
 down.
 micro


strategy
 is
 282.


Little
 green.
 Little
 green.
 The
 Bitcoin


miners,
 let's
 take
 a
 look
 at
 them.
 Uh,
 a


lot
 of
 these
 got
 really
 hit
 over
 the


past
 couple
 weeks,
 but
 they're
 starting


to
 recover.
 Bit
 farm's
 not
 really


recovering.
 I
 mean,
 this
 thing
 was
 at


660.
 It's
 at
 403
 right
 here.
 So,
 this


one's
 still
 wrecked,
 but
 at least
 green


on
 the
 day.
 Marathon,
 that's
 up
 1%.


Riots's
 up
 2%.
 Galaxy,
 I
 still
 don't


understand
 why
 Galaxy
 took
 a
 15%
 hit


yesterday
 given
 like
 they
 had
 a
 break


pretty
 good
 earnings,
 but
 that
 one's


still
 down.
 Iran
 getting
 a
 small


recovery
 rate.
 They're
 up
 3%,
 5373.
 And


then
 Cipher
 up
 1.3.
 Clean
 Spark
 up
 1.5.


Terolf


down
 on
 the
 day.
 Celsius,
 how
 is
 that


one
 doing?
 Celsius
 is
 green
 6212.
 So
 you


got
 some
 momentum
 there.
 Nabius
 10164.


Okay,
 bounced
 from


uh
 97
 from
 yesterday.
 And
 then


Cororeweave,
 which
 fell
 to
 114.
 Coravee


at
 120.
 A
 lot
 of
 those
 data
 center
 plays


starting
 to
 move
 in
 tandem.


Doug
 says,
 "Amit
 all
 my
 late
 September,


early
 October
 gains
 are
 wiped
 out
 as
 of


last
 night.
 I'm
 back
 to
 September
 22,


2025
 balance."
 Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 this


is
 similar
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 A
 lot
 of


the
 gains
 that
 happened
 towards
 the
 end


of
 September.
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 it
 it
 was


because
 of
 a
 massive
 bull
 run,
 not
 only


in
 the
 S&P,
 but
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 like


momentum
 names.
 A
 lot
 of
 those
 names


have
 come
 back
 to
 reality.
 Even
 Tesla,


right?
 Tesla
 at
 417
 now
 5%
 down
 on
 the


day.
 You
 know,
 that's
 wiping
 out
 a
 lot


of
 gains.
 the
 crypto
 stocks
 wiping
 out
 a


lot
 of
 gains
 for
 people
 just
 because


Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 have
 been
 flat.
 So,


it's
 like
 September
 the
 market
 gave
 us


some
 love.
 October,
 it's
 taken
 it
 away


and
 hopefully
 that
 sets
 up
 a
 really


strong
 way
 for
 November
 to
 not
 only
 beat


earnings,
 but
 for
 buybacks
 and
 a
 lot


more
 liquidity
 to
 enter
 the
 markets.


We're
 going
 to
 get
 money
 market
 fund


updates
 later
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 I


mean,
 we
 lost
 17
 billion
 last
 week.


Let's
 see
 if
 the
 idea
 rate
 cuts
 going


into
 next
 week
 is
 enough
 to
 get
 more


money
 out
 of
 those
 funds.
 Right
 now,


7.37
 trillion
 still
 on
 the
 sidelines.


Who's
 buying
 the
 Tesla
 dip?
 Who's
 buying


the
 Tesla
 dip?
 Let
 me
 do
 a
 poll
 right


here
 in
 the
 chat
 on
 who's
 buying
 the
 dip


for


is
 what
 we've
 got.


Are
 you
 buying
 the
 Tessy
 dip?


Why
 are
 you
 guys
 saying
 hell
 no?
 Why
 are


you
 guys
 so
 aggressive?


So
 aggressive
 with
 Tessy,
 bro.
 Goodness.


so
 aggressive.


I
 do
 get
 it
 though,
 dude.
 Like
 I
 I
 I
 I I


don't
 know
 what
 the
 growth
 story
 is
 for


2026.


And
 I
 would
 love
 to
 understand
 what
 it


is,
 but
 even
 based
 on
 what
 Elon
 said


yesterday,
 I
 think
 it's
 more
 of
 a
 2027


story.
 It's
 not
 really
 a
 26
 story,
 which


again,
 it's
 what
 he
 said
 two
 quarters


ago.
 He
 said
 by
 the
 end
 of
 2026,
 you
 can


expect
 some
 growth,
 but
 don't
 expect
 it


for
 the
 next
 three,
 four
 quarters,
 which


would
 imply
 that
 until
 4Q26,


you're
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 have


massive
 massive
 growth.


Uh
 Tesla
 270
 would
 be
 a
 dip.
 The
 dip
 is


at
 350.


The
 Tesla
 diners,
 bro.


A
 2032
 store.
 Okay.
 I
 don't
 know if
 it's


2032,


but
 it
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 it's
 2026.


I'll
 buy
 it
 if
 it
 goes
 to
 300.
 Wow.


Okay.
 So,
 everyone's
 waiting
 for
 a
 lot


lower
 than
 these
 levels.


My
 average
 is
 284.
 I
 wouldn't
 buy
 here.


I'm
 debating
 on
 selling.
 Okay.
 Who's


selling?
 Put
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you're


selling.
 Tell
 their
 419.


The
 only
 compelling
 case
 to
 sell
 if


you're
 trading
 it
 and
 you
 know
 you
 don't


have
 this
 like
 10ear
 thesis
 on
 it
 is


that
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 Q4
 deliveries
 are


going
 to
 beat
 last
 year's
 deliveries
 at


around45,000


with
 no
 uh
 EV
 tax
 credit.
 The
 only


argument
 you
 can
 say
 is
 rate
 cuts
 and


maybe
 like
 some
 holiday
 promotion,
 but


Tesla
 doesn't
 really
 do
 that
 that
 often.


So,


I
 don't
 know.
 We're
 gonna
 have
 to
 see,


you
 know,
 what
 could
 get
 Q4
 to
 get
 some


more
 excitement
 on


on
 Tessy,
 but
 that's
 what
 you
 have
 right


there.
 Now,
 average
 daily
 miles
 driven


using
 FSD,
 that
 has
 grown
 substantially.


14
 million
 miles
 a
 day
 uh
 because
 of
 FSD


are
 driven,
 which
 is
 quite
 incredible.


So,
 you
 got
 some
 stats
 that
 are


continuing
 to
 show
 more
 and
 more


excitement
 and
 momentum.
 And
 uh
 56


billion
 dollars
 of
 revenue
 Tesla
 has


generated
 in
 its
 total
 lifetime.
 So
 half


a
 trillion
 dollars
 the
 company
 has


generated.


It's
 just,
 you
 know,
 the
 earnings


yesterday
 weren't
 exactly
 the
 earnings


that
 everyone
 wanted
 to
 see.
 Test
 right


there.
 421.


421.


BMNR.
 What
 do
 we
 got
 going
 on?
 4860.


Getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 bounce
 right


here.


uh
 a
 myth
 the
 January
 2027
 call
 spreads


for
 micro
 strategy
 or
 a
 nice
 forex
 if


Bitcoin
 takes
 off.


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 look,
 well
 that
 here
 the


inevitable
 question
 for
 going
 leverage


long
 via
 options
 on
 anything


cryptorelated,
 Robin
 Hood
 included
 is
 do


you
 believe
 Bitcoin
 is
 going
 to
 make
 a


move
 that
 people,
 you
 know,
 have
 been


saying
 it's
 going
 to
 make?
 And
 again,


guys,
 we're
 barely
 above
 100,000
 on


this.
 Like
 it
 just
 feels
 so
 fragile.
 And


I
 think
 when
 it
 gets
 to
 the
 low
 hundreds


every
 time
 people
 come
 and
 buy
 the
 dip


because
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 it's


Bitcoin
 and
 people
 want
 to
 buy.
 But
 it


is
 not
 creating
 that
 euphoric
 150
 170


move
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 thought
 would


make.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 needs
 that
 for
 a


micro
 strategy
 option
 or
 a
 Coinbase


option,
 right?


Maybe
 it
 just
 needs
 rate
 cuts.
 Maybe
 we


really
 just
 need
 rate
 cuts.
 Maybe
 that's


the
 missing
 piece
 here
 to
 get
 this


moving.
 So
 up
 1.3%
 2750.


But
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 if
 we


actually
 get
 these
 rate
 cuts.
 JP
 Morgan


expects
 the
 Fed
 to
 end
 quantitative


tightening
 next
 week.
 That
 makes
 sense.


We
 know
 the
 Fed
 is
 going
 to
 likely
 or
 I


mean
 JPAL
 even
 said
 that
 he's
 likely


going
 to
 you
 know
 tamper
 down
 on
 QT


Vertive
 that
 is
 that
 moving
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 of
 reaction.
 Okay,
 there
 you


go.
 Up
 5%.
 That
 one
 had
 a
 great
 earnings


yesterday.
 That
 one
 got
 hit.
 Some
 of
 the


other
 companies
 that
 had
 earnings
 today.


So
 we
 talked
 about
 American
 Airlines.


Let
 me
 pull
 up
 some
 of
 the
 other
 names.


So
 we
 had
 AAL.
 Uh
 yeah
 T-Mobile
 they


beat
 on
 revenue
 or
 sorry
 beat
 on
 EPS


missed
 on
 revenue.
 T-Mobile,
 that
 stock


is
 down
 2.4,
 but
 you
 did
 have
 some


decent
 results,
 which
 is
 good.


Blackstone
 beat
 by
 24%
 on
 EPS.
 Private


equity
 firm
 beat
 by
 6%
 on
 revenue.
 3.3


versus
 3.1,
 152
 versus
 123.


Blackstone,
 that
 stock
 is
 down
 2.4.
 We


did
 have
 a
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the


bottom.
 Uh,
 and
 then
 you
 had
 Honeywell


that
 beat
 by
 10%
 on
 EPS,
 beat
 by
 2%
 on


revenue,
 which
 is
 not
 the
 worst
 thing
 in


the
 world.
 Again,
 a
 lot
 of
 these


companies
 either
 coming
 in
 line
 with


expectations
 or
 really
 beating


Honeywell.
 That's
 up
 5.4%


on
 the
 day.


That's
 what
 you
 got.
 Amit,
 what's
 your


target
 for
 BMR
 this
 year?
 You
 know,
 I
 I


thought
 70
 to
 75
 target
 was
 reasonable.


And
 I
 know
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 ago
 that


sounded
 pretty
 bearish,
 but
 I
 I
 was
 not


really
 in
 the
 camp
 that
 100
 to
 150
 or


500
 like
 some
 of these
 people
 on
 Twitter


were
 saying
 just
 because
 I
 I
 didn't
 I


don't
 know
 if
 ETH
 gets
 to,
 you
 know,
 8


9,000
 like
 people
 some
 people
 are


saying,
 but
 I
 think
 ETH
 could
 get
 to


5,500
 to
 6,000.
 And
 I
 guess
 now
 it
 seems


more
 ambitious
 given
 that
 ETH's
 been


flat.
 But
 you
 know,
 when
 ETH
 was
 at
 42


4,300
 when
 I
 made
 that
 prediction,
 I
 was


like,
 well,
 if
 it
 can
 get
 to
 55,
 even
 if


it
 can
 get
 to
 five,
 you're
 going
 to
 see


BMR
 get
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 multiple.
 Oh,


speaking
 of
 BMR
 and
 Ethereum,
 uh,
 this


this
 came
 out
 to
 this
 morning,
 which
 I


thought
 was
 pretty
 incredible
 to
 see.


Take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 You've
 now
 got


international
 companies
 that
 are


starting
 Ethereum
 treasuries.


So,
 you've
 got
 this
 company.
 I
 don't


know
 what
 they
 do.
 It's
 called
 Quantum


Solutions.
 I
 don't know
 if
 they're
 a


quantum
 firm,
 but
 I
 I've
 not
 looked
 into


them.
 But,
 uh,
 the
 the
 CEO
 of
 the


company
 said,
 "We
 just
 bought
 2,365


Ethereum
 in
 the
 last
 seven
 days."
 Now,
 I


really
 don't
 care
 about
 this
 company's


digital
 asset
 treasury.
 Like,
 I
 can
 care


less
 about
 that.
 I
 care
 about
 Tom
 Lee


and
 BMR,
 but
 it
 is
 really
 nice
 to
 have


more
 and
 more
 of
 these
 guys
 pop
 up
 and


buy
 Ethereum
 because
 it
 helps
 Ethereum's


price.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 they're
 going to


be
 able
 to
 accretively
 dilute
 and
 have
 a


premium
 against
 their
 NAV.
 That's
 a


different
 question.
 And
 Amazon,
 by
 the


way,
 breaking
 above
 220,
 but
 it
 does


mean
 more
 demand
 on
 the
 actual
 asset


itself,
 which
 is
 good
 to
 see.
 So,
 the


question
 is,
 how
 many
 more
 of
 these
 pop


up
 and
 how
 many
 more
 of
 these
 continue


to
 buy
 Ethereum?
 And,
 you
 know,
 over
 the


long
 term,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 that


ends
 up
 playing
 up.
 Has
 Tom
 explained


why
 he
 thinks
 Bitcoin
 will
 go
 to
 200?
 I


mean,
 from
 what
 I
 understand
 by


listening
 to
 him,
 it's
 a
 combination
 of


Fed
 policy
 easing
 and
 overall
 crypto


tailwinds
 going
 into
 Q4.
 Uh,
 by
 the
 way,


Hood
 and
 Palenter
 going
 green
 on
 the
 day


along
 with
 SoFi
 S&P
 as
 well.
 Look
 at


that
 green
 candle.
 Six
 almost
 670.


We're
 getting
 some
 green
 across
 the


board,
 folks.
 The
 only
 thing
 that's
 red


is
 Tesla
 getting
 some
 green
 across
 the


board.
 But
 yeah,
 he
 thinks
 crypto
 tends


to
 do
 well
 in
 Q4
 and
 he
 thinks
 that
 the


Fed
 easing
 probably
 will
 be
 a
 tailwind.


So
 that
 is
 his
 argument
 for
 why
 200,000


could
 happen.


Dude,
 we're
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 pump.


We're
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 pump,
 which


means
 we're
 going to
 get
 a
 dump
 in
 like


five
 minutes,
 right?


We're
 gonna
 get
 a
 dump
 in
 like
 five


minutes.


Dude,
 it's
 a
 nice
 pump.
 Meta,
 look
 at


Wes's.
 We
 haven't
 seen
 740
 on
 Meta
 in
 a


minute.
 Applovin's
 up
 1%.
 Circle's
 up
 a


bit.
 Pinterest
 is
 up.
 Uh,
 how
 about


Oaklo?
 If
 Oakland
 goes
 green,
 we're


really
 pumping.


Okay,
 Oaklo's
 not
 going
 green
 yet,
 but


at least
 it's
 not
 down.
 Is
 when
 Oakl


goes
 green,
 that's
 how
 you
 know
 we
 are


pumping
 for
 the
 day.
 We
 are
 pumping
 for


the
 day.


66970


GM
 all-time
 highs.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 General


Motors
 deserves
 it.
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 us


probably
 are
 not
 investors
 in
 this


company.
 I
 I
 don't
 own
 this
 stock,
 but


dude,
 they
 had
 a
 fantastic
 quarter
 and


they
 had
 a
 growth
 quarter
 and,
 you
 know,


they're
 not
 a
 $ 1.5
 trillion
 company.


They're
 a
 $65
 billion
 company.
 So,
 the


pressure
 on
 them
 to
 perform
 is
 not
 as


great
 as
 Tesla,
 but
 still,
 they
 had
 a


great
 quarter.
 They
 executed
 and
 as
 a


result,
 you're
 uh
 you're
 getting
 some


excitement
 right
 here.
 Speaking
 of


crypto,
 this
 is
 Fed
 Governor
 Waller


talking
 about
 crypto
 yesterday
 at
 that


crypto
 round
 table
 that
 the
 entire
 Fed


had.
 And
 here
 is
 what
 one
 of the
 people


who
 votes
 for
 rate
 cuts
 had
 to
 say
 about


crypto.


>> This
 is
 an
 acknowledgement
 that


distributed
 ledgers
 and
 crypto
 assets


are
 no
 longer
 on
 the
 fringes,
 but
 are


increasingly
 woven
 into
 the
 fabric
 of


the
 payment
 and
 financial
 system.
 Now,


before
 we
 hear
 from
 these
 innovators,
 I


would
 like
 to
 touch
 on
 roles
 that
 the


reserve
 plays
 to
 support
 the
 private


sector.
 These
 include
 serving
 as
 a


convenor
 to
 solve
 coordination
 problems


and
 operating
 core
 payment
 and


settlement
 infrastructure.
 We
 are
 also


looking
 ahead
 conducting
 hands-on


research
 on
 tokenization
 using
 smart


contracts
 and
 the
 intersection
 of
 AI
 and


payments
 for
 use
 in
 our
 own
 payment


systems.
 We
 are
 looking
 at
 tokenization,


AI,
 and
 the
 intersection
 of
 blockchains


for
 our
 own
 payment
 infrastructure.
 I


mean,
 dude,
 how
 much
 more
 bullish
 could


you
 get?
 That
 is
 one
 of
 the
 Fed


presidents,
 potentially
 one
 of
 the
 next


Fed
 chairs,
 saying
 that
 we
 are
 ready
 as


a
 Federal
 Reserve
 to
 start
 embracing
 the


crypto
 ecosystem.
 Sounds
 like
 a
 lot
 of


ETH
 related
 stuff.
 That
 is
 correct.
 By


the
 way,
 I
 finally
 sat
 down
 yesterday


and
 I
 read
 Devon
 Ryan's
 report,
 who
 is


one
 of
 the
 only
 analysts
 on
 Wall
 Street


that
 I
 actually
 trust
 in
 fintech
 on
 ESP.


And
 um
 outside
 of
 him
 picking
 ESB
 over


Bitmine,
 the
 the
 the
 simple
 reason
 is


ESB
 trades
 at
 blow
 nav.
 So
 he
 thinks


it's
 more
 attractive
 um
 because
 you
 know


you're
 getting
 it
 way
 cheaper
 than


paying
 1.4
 times
 for
 for
 BMR.
 If
 you
 go


through
 his
 report,
 it's
 like
 seven


pages
 on
 why
 Ethereum
 is
 going
 to
 win.


And
 it's
 like
 you're
 getting
 more
 and


more
 validation
 from
 Wall
 Street


analysts
 that
 are
 starting
 to
 think,
 no,


no,
 no,
 this
 Ethereum
 thing
 is
 not
 a


joke.
 Like
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of


the
 global
 financial
 blockchains
 that


controls
 the
 payment
 solutions
 that
 get


on
 rail
 to
 to
 to
 um
 distributed
 ledgers.


And
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that,
 there's
 going


to
 be
 value
 that's
 acrewing
 to
 that


network.
 And
 the
 reason
 he
 initiated
 a


$50
 target
 on
 ASBET
 is
 because
 he
 thinks


it's
 really
 cheap
 because
 they're


trading
 at
 083
 times
 NAV.
 And
 so
 if
 you


believe
 in
 Ethereum,
 then
 you
 believe
 in


that
 sort
 of
 leverage
 against
 Ethereum.


And
 then
 he
 just
 wants
 the,
 you
 know,


the
 most
 juicy
 price
 as
 an
 analyst,


which
 is
 SPE
 over
 B&R.
 But
 the
 point
 is


he's
 very
 bullish
 Ethereum.
 And
 I
 he,


you
 know,
 he
 called
 Robin
 Hood
 at
 $8.


He's
 one
 of
 the
 analysts
 that
 I
 actually


like
 listening
 to.
 It's
 nice
 to
 see


different
 perspectives
 from
 people
 on


the
 street
 that
 usually
 are
 skeptical
 of


of
 digital
 asset
 treasuries,
 but
 his


report
 was
 like,
 "No,
 we
 think
 it
 makes


a
 lot
 of
 sense
 because
 Ethereum
 is
 going


to
 win."
 And
 then
 you
 have
 the
 Fed
 being


as
 supportive
 as
 they're
 supportive
 as


as
 they
 talk
 about
 on
 that
 video.
 You


might
 start
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 that


momentum,
 even
 if
 it
 doesn't
 happen
 all


at
 once.
 Robin
 Hood

That's

 Another

here
 on

 Uh
 banking
 is
 out


for
 some
 people,
 not
 everybody.
 And
 it


looks
 pretty
 incredible.
 It
 looks
 pretty


freaking
 incredible.
 So,
 I
 got
 tagged
 in


a
 couple
 posts
 yesterday
 on
 the
 UI
 of


what
 banking
 looks
 like.
 They
 are
 giving


you
 guys
 3.75%


in
 your
 checking
 account.
 I
 think
 that's


going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 to
 switch.


I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of


people
 to
 switch.
 Look
 at
 that.
 If
 you


set
 up
 direct
 deposit,
 you
 get
 3.75%
 in


your
 checkings
 account.
 There's
 no
 other


bank
 that
 does
 that.
 There's
 the
 UI


right
 there.
 Savings
 APY,
 the
 same


thing.
 3.75%.


And
 then
 there
 is
 all
 the
 different


elements
 to
 the
 user
 experience.
 I
 mean,


I
 think
 when
 banking
 rolls
 out,
 it
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 big
 product.
 And
 when


that
 does
 happen,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


pretty
 pretty
 exciting
 as
 well.
 IBM
 is


down
 because
 they
 missed
 on
 a
 couple


estimates.
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 a


meaningful
 reason
 for
 why
 they
 should
 be


down
 that
 much.
 They
 were
 down
 9%,
 now


they're
 down
 4%.
 So,
 you
 got
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 recovery
 right
 there
 on
 the


green
 candle.
 Tesla's
 still
 down
 4%.


Everything
 else
 is
 pumping.
 S&P,
 wow,


670.
 We
 got
 it.
 670.


670
 on
 the
 S&P.


There
 you
 go.
 There
 you
 go.
 Look
 at
 her.

 to

 Reddit
 that's

 well.
 Duolingo,
 that's


up

 Let's
 look
 at
 the
 heat
 map.
 I


would
 think
 we're
 getting
 some
 pretty


big
 greener.
 Yeah,
 look
 at
 that.
 The


only
 thing
 that's
 red
 is
 Tesla,


T-Mobile,
 and
 IBM.
 And
 then
 healthcare.


Tesla,
 T-Mobile,
 IBM,
 and
 healthcare
 are


red.
 Almost
 everything
 else
 is
 green.


Almost
 everything
 else
 is
 green.
 Oscar


again
 dumping
 because
 of
 healthcare.
 I
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 an
 Oscar
 thing.
 So,
 if


you're
 an
 Oscar,
 I
 wouldn't
 be
 too
 upset


about
 this.
 It
 seems
 like
 a
 Molina


healthcare.
 It's
 something
 you
 need
 to


be
 cautious
 of
 to
 you.
 If
 you're
 an


Oscar
 shareholder
 and
 you
 have
 a
 heavy


position,
 I
 think
 you
 need
 to
 go
 through


Molina's
 earnings
 and
 be
 like,
 what


trends
 in
 the
 earnings
 could
 be


applicable
 to
 my
 stock,
 aka
 Oscar,
 in


the
 healthcare
 space.
 And
 if
 there's
 not


any
 trends
 that
 are
 like
 a
 proportional


reason
 for
 why
 Oscar
 would
 also
 report


something
 that's
 as
 bad
 as
 what
 Molina


reported,
 then
 it's
 it
 becomes
 a
 buy
 the


dip.
 But
 if
 there
 is,
 you
 know,
 some


potential
 weakness
 in
 the
 overall


sector,
 you
 know,
 Oscar
 could
 have
 a


crappy
 earnings.
 And
 so
 that's
 the
 one


thing
 I
 think
 that's
 important
 to
 look


at
 if
 you're
 an
 Oscar.
 Hoodie
 trying
 to


go

 Tesla
 down
 4%.


Still
 Tesla
 recovering
 a
 little
 bit
 and


the
 S&P
 is
 still
 green.
 Where's
 uh
 fear


and
 greed?


We
 were
 at
 extreme
 fear
 yesterday,
 by


the
 way.
 We
 were
 at
 extreme
 fear.


Someone
 bought
 $10
 million
 worth
 of
 at


the
 money
 puts
 on
 Tesla.
 All right.
 So


you're
 getting
 some
 put
 option
 flow
 come


in
 for
 Tessie.
 That's
 more
 bearish.
 We


are
 still
 at
 fear,
 folks.
 We're
 still
 at


the
 year.
 Dude,
 I
 know
 people
 hate
 this


index,
 but
 it's
 been
 pretty
 accurate.


It's
 been
 pretty
 accurate.
 And
 I
 can't


even
 imagine
 what
 extreme
 greed
 would


look
 if
 we
 are
 1%
 away
 from
 alltime


highs
 on
 the
 S&P
 500
 and
 we
 were
 at


extreme
 fear.
 I
 mean,
 are
 we
 going
 to


like
 15,000
 on
 the
 S&P
 to
 get
 to
 extreme


greed?
 Like,
 what's
 what's
 it
 going
 to


take?
 Like,


it's
 it's
 pretty
 incredible
 to
 see
 this


index
 act
 the
 way
 it
 acts.
 But


so
 far
 we
 are
 back
 in
 fear
 29
 on
 the


S&P.


Uh
 Nebius
 goes
 green
 as
 well.
 Nebus
 and


Cororee
 continuing
 to
 go
 green.
 And
 then


Oaklo


still
 red
 dude.
 Oaklo
 still
 red.
 S&P


trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 alltime
 highs.
 And


Oaklo
 cannot
 recover
 even
 a
 dollar
 of


what
 it
 lost
 over
 the
 past
 two
 days.
 The


quantum
 stocks
 are
 are
 massively
 green.


I
 mean,
 if
 it
 wasn't
 for
 that
 Wall


Street
 Journal
 article,
 the
 quantum


stocks
 might
 have
 had
 the
 bottom
 fall


out
 today
 along
 with
 Oakllo
 because


you're
 seeing
 a
 rebound
 across
 the


entire
 market
 except
 some
 of
 those


momentum
 names
 like
 in
 Oaklo.


And
 the
 thing
 about
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal
 article
 is
 we
 don't
 even
 know
 if


it's
 fully
 true.
 And
 for
 those
 that


don't
 know
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about,
 the


Trump
 administration
 is
 thinking
 of


taking
 equity
 stakes
 in
 the
 quantum


names.


So,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 when
 we
 get
 clarity


on
 that,
 we're
 going to
 see
 how
 the


market
 reacts.
 But
 as
 of
 now,
 that
 is


what's
 holding
 up
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names.


to
 still
 be
 green.
 S&P
 670.


S&P
 still
 670.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 about


the
 forward
 PE
 for
 the
 market
 as
 we're


in
 the
 22
 to
 25
 range?
 I
 think
 it's


justified.
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 I
 I
 I
 I


don't
 think
 we
 need
 to
 be
 at
 any


historical
 PE
 of
 uh
 what's
 16
 to
 18


times
 when
 you
 have
 the
 quality
 of


companies
 that
 we
 have
 in
 the
 market


right
 now
 that
 are
 putting
 up
 the


earnings
 growth
 that
 they're
 putting
 up.


I
 mean
 again
 the
 way
 to
 push
 back


against
 the
 high
 earnings
 multiple
 on


not
 only
 the
 broader
 index
 for
 the


market
 but
 any
 stock
 is
 are
 they
 growing


like
 the
 the
 people
 that
 hate
 Paler's


valuation
 which
 I
 understand
 I
 get
 it
 I


get
 that
 quantitatively
 it's
 hard
 to


make
 sense
 of
 it
 but
 is
 pounder
 growing


top
 and
 bottom
 line
 and
 are
 they
 growing


not
 just
 like
 growth
 are
 they
 like


growing
 growing
 and
 the
 answer
 is
 yes


and
 when
 that
 stops
 the
 stock
 will
 get


hit
 but
 until
 that
 stops
 which
 you
 know


if
 you
 don't
 see
 the
 trajectory
 of
 that


stopping
 anytime
 soon
 then
 the
 valuation


could
 be
 justified
 ified.
 But
 on
 some
 of


these
 names
 where
 there's
 like
 just
 no


growth,
 there's
 nothing
 there.
 That's


where
 it's
 hard
 to
 make
 sense
 of
 it.
 So


for
 the
 S&P,
 there's
 growth.
 There's
 10%


earnings
 growth.
 You're
 lucky
 to
 get,


you
 know,
 five
 to
 six%
 earnings
 growth


on
 a
 good
 year.
 Fact
 that
 we're
 getting


10
 to
 11%.


With
 companies
 that
 have
 massive
 margins


because
 they're
 tech
 companies.
 That's


why
 I
 think
 you
 can
 make
 an
 argument
 for


the
 multiple.
 So
 right
 here,
 3%
 growing


through
 28,
 which
 is
 nice
 to
 see.
 Stock


got
 all
 the
 way
 to
 26.40
 40
 yesterday.


So
 28
 on
 the
 S&P
 or
 on
 SoFi.


If
 you
 look
 up
 Oakllo's
 address,
 it


gives
 you
 a
 place
 when
 you
 search.
 It's


a
 normal
 house
 with
 no
 office
 building.


Yeah,
 I've
 seen
 those
 pictures
 of
 Oaklo.


I
 mean,
 that
 is
 also
 kind
 of
 weird.
 If


you
 It's
 It's
 true
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 these


companies.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 head,
 if


you
 like
 look
 up
 their
 office
 address,


this
 is
 what
 the
 Oakllo
 headquarters


looks
 like.


I
 mean,
 maybe
 there's
 a
 bunch
 of
 people


here
 designing
 the
 next
 generation
 of


nuclear
 energy
 in
 the
 United
 States
 of


America,


or
 maybe
 it's
 just
 a
 random
 location


because
 they
 just
 needed
 a
 spot
 to
 put


on
 their
 on
 their
 uh
 SEC
 filings
 as
 a


location.
 But


it
 is
 definitely
 weird.
 It
 is
 definitely


weird.
 Figure
 robotics
 company
 Brett


Adcock
 posted,
 "Figure's
 new
 B200


cluster
 is
 now
 online.
 These
 are
 a
 bunch


of
 Blackwell
 GPUs
 that
 you
 are
 looking


at
 folks.
 Um,
 some
 analysis
 right
 here.


33
 units
 in
 sight
 that
 look
 like
 super


micro
 10u
 systems
 each
 with
 eight
 GPUs.


Total
 cost
 estimated
 by
 Grock
 is
 14


million.


We
 are
 not
 really
 looking
 towards
 the


demand
 for
 humanoid
 robotics
 training


and
 how
 much
 Nvidia
 is
 going
 to
 make
 off


that
 including
 AMD.
 I
 mean
 all
 those


companies
 that
 supply
 chips.


These
 are
 only
 eight
 GPUs.
 I
 mean


figures
 trying
 to
 sell
 billions
 of


robots.
 So
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 know
 the


total
 cost
 was
 this
 for
 14
 million
 you


can
 imagine
 that
 these
 companies
 are


going
 to
 be
 spending
 hundreds
 of


millions
 if
 not
 billions
 of
 dollars
 on


GPUs
 over
 the
 next
 10
 years
 if
 humanoid


robotics
 as
 a
 thesis
 plays
 out
 and
 you


know
 that
 is
 another
 growth
 vertical
 for


Nvidia
 that
 might
 not
 be
 factored
 in


18150


is
 what
 you
 have
 on
 Nvidia
 Nebius
 right


here
 that's
 up
 5%
 look
 at
 that
 104


10465
 on
 Nebus
 yes
 SMCI
 had
 net
 sales
 of


five
 billion
 versus
 uh
 the
 expected


ones,
 which
 is
 why
 SMCI
 taking
 a
 bit
 of


a
 hit
 right
 here,
 but
 it
 is
 recovering


from
 where
 it
 was
 in
 the
 pre-markets


and
 core
 is
 also


green
 as
 well.
 Thoughts
 on
 the
 7.4

 markets?
 Coiled
 spring


waiting
 for
 the
 Fed?
 Yeah,
 that's
 pretty


much
 what
 I
 think.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 coiled


spring.
 I
 think
 eventually
 that
 money
 is


going
 to
 come
 out.
 Now,
 again,
 we
 got
 to


have
 really
 good
 earnings
 growth
 for


that
 money
 to
 have
 a
 reason
 to
 come
 out,


but
 we're
 getting
 it
 so
 far.
 And
 I
 know


Tesla
 and
 Netflix
 haven't
 been
 the
 best


examples
 of
 it,
 but
 next
 week
 you're


going
 to
 really
 see
 if
 people
 want
 to


bet
 on
 Meta,
 Google,
 Amazon,
 Microsoft,


etc.


They're
 going to
 have
 to
 put
 up
 those


numbers.
 Amazon
 right
 there
 220.41


on

 as
 well.
 Did
 CPI
 leak?
 You


know,
 to
 be
 honest,
 given
 this
 green,


maybe
 CPI
 usually
 it
 leaks
 at
 3:30


though,
 not
 in
 the
 morning.
 It's
 not


even
 10
 a.m.
 yet.


But
 we're
 going
 to
 see


if
 we
 do
 get
 some
 more
 people
 caring


about
 CPI.


Um,


admit
 I
 think
 you're
 right.
 Grab
 is


being
 manipulated.
 Look,
 that's
 my


thesis
 on
 it.
 Maybe
 I'm
 wrong.
 I
 just


I'm
 open
 to
 listening
 to
 a
 different


perspective
 on
 why
 the
 stock
 has
 been


flat
 after
 trading
 a
 billion
 shares
 in


September.
 Uh,
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 being


institutional.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 like


here's
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 to


understand
 about
 Grab.
 It
 got
 to
 660
 in


September.
 A
 billion
 shares
 were
 traded.


And
 I
 am
 not
 Eric
 Jackson.
 I
 am
 not


standing
 in
 front
 of
 a
 celebrity's
 house


telling
 them
 to
 buy
 a
 share
 of
 Grab


every
 single
 day.
 I
 can
 I
 personally


cannot
 create
 a
 retail
 movement.
 I
 know


I'm
 one
 of
 the
 bigger
 names
 that
 talks


about
 the
 stock,
 but
 I'm
 not
 the
 guy


that's
 created
 this
 massive
 movement.
 I


mean,
 like
 just
 grabbs
 also
 not
 even
 an


interesting
 enough
 company
 like
 an
 open


door
 inside
 of
 the
 United
 States
 that


has
 all
 these
 elements
 to
 it
 to
 get


people
 excited.
 So,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


those
 billion
 shares
 that
 were
 traded
 in


September
 that
 got
 the
 stock
 to
 move
 as


high
 as
 it
 did
 was
 not
 people
 on
 Robin


Hood.
 You
 don't
 see
 people
 with
 Robin


Hood
 screenshots
 that
 have
 400,000


shares
 like
 you
 do
 with
 Open
 Door.
 I


mean,
 like
 I've
 seen
 so
 many
 of
 those


screenshots
 over
 the
 past
 month.
 I


really
 do
 think
 it
 was
 big
 money.
 So


then
 the
 question
 becomes,
 why
 is
 the


stock
 down
 from
 where
 it
 was
 in


September?
 Well,
 I
 think
 it's
 also
 big


money
 that's
 either
 setting
 up
 for
 a
 big


earnings
 move.
 They
 wanted
 a
 cheaper


price
 or
 you
 have
 the
 shorts
 that
 come


in
 and
 it's
 a
 game
 between
 big
 money


versus
 shorts.
 And
 the
 only
 way
 for
 one


of
 the
 entities
 to
 win,
 just
 like
 it
 was


with
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 companies
 when
 they


were
 stuck
 in
 this
 phase,
 is
 earnings


growth.
 And
 so
 realistically,
 I
 think
 if


Grab
 can
 put
 up
 the
 numbers,
 then
 things


can
 change.
 But
 until
 then,
 I
 think
 it


is
 manipulated.
 But
 I
 really
 don't
 think


this
 was
 a
 retail
 pump
 and
 dump
 when
 it


got
 to
 $6
 or
 650
 in
 September
 because


retail
 just
 doesn't
 care
 enough
 about


the
 name.
 They
 just
 don't
 like
 it's
 a


Southeast
 Asian
 company.
 Like
 the
 retail


has
 so
 there's
 so
 many
 AI
 data
 center


[ __ ]
 Like
 if
 this
 was
 a
 Bitcoin
 miner,


yeah,
 if
 this
 was
 a
 quantum
 nuclear,
 but


this
 is
 not.
 This
 is
 just
 like
 Uber
 for


Southeast
 Asia.
 So
 to
 me,
 it's
 not
 the


most
 exciting
 from
 a
 retail
 perspective.


And
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 the
 stock
 kind
 of


going
 up
 and
 then
 going
 down
 is
 is
 more


manipulation
 than
 anything.
 But
 earnings


is
 going to
 give
 us
 the
 good
 story
 or


earnings
 is
 going
 to
 give
 us
 a
 story.


And
 if
 that
 story
 is
 good,
 which
 I
 think


it
 will
 be.
 Then
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how


the
 stock
 ultimately
 reacts.


Uh
 yes,
 Triple
 V
 has
 millions
 of
 shares,


but
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 you
 know,
 not


everyone
 is
 TripleV
 that
 has
 millions
 of


shares.
 He's,
 you
 know,
 one
 retail


investor.
 I
 think
 the
 majority
 of
 the


institutional
 flow
 which
 is
 now
 85%.


Is
 big
 money
 on
 this
 name.
 Where's


Amcore
 on
 the
 day?
 Amcor


31.
 Okay.
 Amcore
 right
 there.
 Up
 2.6%.


Intel.
 Is
 that
 green?
 37.


Oaklo
 goes
 green.
 There
 you
 go,
 folks.


Well,
 no,
 it's
 not
 green
 yet.
 It's
 50


cents
 away
 from
 where
 it's
 close
 to


being
 green.
 Once
 that
 goes
 green,
 we


can
 go
 back
 to
 alltime
 highs
 on
 the
 S&P.


That's
 what
 we
 need.


That
 is
 what
 we
 need.


Um,
 oh,
 we
 got
 home
 sales
 from
 the
 US.


Hold
 on.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 get
 those


numbers.


I
 didn't
 know
 we
 would
 get
 these


existing
 home
 sales
 because


the
 government
 shut
 down,
 but
 guess
 we


have
 them.
 Let's
 pull
 it
 up
 right
 here.


>> Joe
 Leavia
 about
 those
 findings.
 and


Tesla
 rose
 one
 and
 a
 half%
 from
 August


to
 a
 seasonally
 adjusted
 annualized
 rate


of
 4.06
 million
 units.
 That's
 a
 little


less
 than
 the
 street
 was
 expecting.


Sales
 up
 4.1%
 from
 September
 of
 last


year
 and
 it
 is
 the
 highest
 pace
 in
 7


months.
 Now
 discount
 is
 based
 on


closings.
 So
 people
 inking
 deals
 in
 July


and
 August
 when
 mortgage
 rates
 were


coming
 down
 though
 not
 quite
 as
 low
 as


they
 are
 now.
 Inventory
 is
 the
 headline


though
 up
 14%
 from
 a
 year
 ago
 to
 1.55


million
 units
 for
 sale
 at
 the
 end
 of


September.
 That
 matches
 a
 five-year


high,
 but
 it's
 still
 much
 lower
 than


historical
 averages.
 At
 the
 current


sales
 pace,
 we're
 now
 at
 a
 4.6
 month


supply.
 And
 that
 continues
 to
 pressure


prices.
 The
 median
 price
 of
 a
 home
 sold


in
 September,
 $415,200,


up
 2.1%
 year-over-year
 and
 the
 27th


consecutive
 month
 of
 annual
 gains.


First-time
 buyers
 making
 a
 little


comeback,
 likely
 due
 to
 falling
 mortgage


rates.
 They
 made
 up
 30%
 of
 September


sales,
 up
 from
 26%
 a
 year
 ago.
 30%
 of


sales
 were
 all
 cash.
 Homes
 are
 sitting


on
 the
 market
 longer
 though,
 an
 average


33
 days,
 up
 from
 28
 days
 a
 year
 ago.


Back
 to
 you,
 Mike.


>> All
 right,
 Diana,
 thank
 you
 very
 much.


Now
 to
 Washington
 and
 two
 big
 stories


out
 of
 the
 White
 House
 moving
 markets


this
 morning.
 New
 energy
 sanctions
 on


Russia
 and
 reports
 the
 government
 is


eyeing
 stakes
 in
 quantum
 computing


companies.
 Let's
 get
 to
 Aean
 Javvers


with
 the
 latest
 on
 both
 of
 these


storylines.
 Aean.


>> Yeah,
 Mike.
 President
 Trump's
 decision


to
 impose
 sanctions
 on
 Russian
 oil


companies
 Rosnap
 and
 Luke
 Oil
 came
 after


the
 breakdown
 of
 talks
 between
 the
 US


and
 Russia
 for
 another
 face-to-face


meeting
 between
 President
 Trump
 and


Russian
 leader
 Vladimir
 Putin.
 A
 senior


White
 House
 official
 told
 me
 yesterday


that
 the
 president
 decided
 to
 put
 on


these
 additional
 sanctions
 because
 he


wants
 to
 see
 results
 in
 the
 peace


process
 between
 Russia
 and
 Ukraine.


President
 Trump
 explained
 his
 reasoning


for
 this
 uh
 during
 his
 meeting
 yesterday


with
 the
 Secretary
 General
 of
 NATO.


certainly
 have
 an
 impact
 there.
 They're


massive
 sanctions
 and
 sanctions
 on
 oil.


Uh
 the
 two
 biggest
 oil
 companies
 among


the
 biggest
 in
 the
 world,
 but
 they're


Russian.
 They
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 oil
 and


hopefully
 it'll
 push
 uh


hopefully
 he'll
 become
 reasonable.


And
 separately,
 guys,
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal,
 as
 you
 mentioned,
 is
 reporting


that
 the
 Trump
 administration
 is
 ready


to
 take
 equity
 stakes
 in
 several
 quantum


computing
 firms.
 The
 Journal
 reports


that
 the
 US
 government
 could
 invest
 a


minimum
 of
 $10
 million
 in
 each
 company,


and
 that
 the
 firms
 under
 consideration


include
 ion,
 Regetti
 Computing,
 and


D-Wave
 Quantum.
 White
 House
 officials


have
 not
 confirmed
 the
 accuracy
 of
 that


report
 to
 CNBC,
 but
 officials
 have
 told


me
 generally
 several
 times
 that
 there


are
 quite
 a
 few
 companies
 that
 are
 under


discussions
 with
 the
 administration


right
 now
 to
 turn
 over
 a
 share
 of
 their


ownership
 in
 exchange
 for
 government


investment.
 Back
 over
 to
 you
 guys.


>> All
 right,
 so
 home
 sales
 slight
 miss.


You
 got
 the
 Russia
 shank
 sanctions
 that


we
 talked
 about
 in
 the
 morning
 and
 then


the
 quantum
 names,
 folks.
 I
 mean,
 quite


literally,
 Donnie
 T
 saved
 the
 day.
 These


stocks
 probably
 would
 either
 be
 flat
 or


continue,
 you
 know,
 the
 negative


pressure
 that
 they've
 had
 over
 the
 past


two
 weeks.
 Now,
 government
 comes
 in
 and


backs
 stops
 it.
 And
 the
 fact
 that
 they


haven't
 confirmed
 the
 rumors
 from
 the


Wall
 Street
 Journal
 is
 interesting
 to
 me


because
 like
 if
 they
 were
 not
 investing,


they
 might
 have
 already
 just
 said,
 "No,


we're
 not
 investing."
 But
 they
 haven't


said
 that
 yet.
 And
 so,
 you
 might
 get
 an


announcement
 later
 in
 the
 day
 and
 they


say,
 "Yeah,
 we're
 thinking
 of
 putting
 10


million
 into
 D-Wave
 and
 ONQ
 and
 all


those
 companies
 and
 then
 boom,
 that
 only


further
 legitimizes
 them.
 Now,
 these


stocks
 are
 still
 down
 a
 decent
 chunk


over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks,
 but
 a
 day


like
 this
 kind
 of
 gets
 them
 back
 in


their
 mojo.
 Tesla
 right
 there
 at
 3.3%.


That's
 still
 down
 424,
 although
 it
 is


recovering
 S&P
 669.79.


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 10
 million
 investments
 is


more
 than
 the
 revenue
 that
 some
 of
 those


companies
 made
 last
 quarter,
 which
 is


also
 kind
 of
 crazy.


So,
 if
 you
 closed
 out
 the
 short


yesterday,
 if
 you
 have
 like
 these


inverse
 short
 funds
 or
 whatever,
 or
 if


you're
 actually
 short
 or
 you
 have
 puts,


like
 yesterday
 was
 the
 day
 to
 close
 them


out.
 Now,
 granted,
 who
 could
 have
 known


that
 uh
 there
 was
 this
 type
 of


announcement
 coming
 after
 hours,
 but
 if


you
 did
 know,
 then
 obviously
 you
 made


some
 money
 and
 you're
 able
 to


kind
 of
 navigate
 how
 the
 government
 was


thinking
 about.
 Now,
 there
 was
 a
 little


bit
 of
 option
 flow
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 on
 people
 buying
 uh
 options
 on


the
 quantum
 stock.
 So,
 one
 could
 argue


that,
 you
 know,
 some
 people
 knew
 this


was
 happening,
 which
 of
 course,
 you


know,
 that
 wouldn't
 surprise
 me
 for
 the


people
 that
 did
 know.
 But
 regardless,
 it


definitely
 caught
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 off


guard,
 especially
 if
 you
 were
 short.
 And


as
 a
 result,
 now
 you're
 seeing
 these


names
 continue
 to
 get
 some
 love.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 Crystal
 has
 a
 short
 fund.
 I
 but


Chris
 went
 short
 like
 30
 bucks
 ago
 or


not
 30
 20
 bucks
 ago.
 So
 I
 think
 even


even
 with
 this
 move
 today
 I
 think
 he's


still
 profitable
 on
 it.
 He
 went
 short
 a


couple
 weeks
 ago
 and
 it's
 still
 down
 a


decent
 chunk
 from
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago.
 I


think
 I
 think
 we'll
 have
 Chris
 on
 for


macro
 Thursday
 today.
 So
 I'll
 ask
 him
 if


he's
 still
 in
 it
 or
 not.
 But


uh
 yesterday
 was
 the
 best
 day
 to
 kind
 of


sell
 out
 on
 those
 names.


Uh
 Trump
 is
 speaking
 at
 3
 p.m.
 today.


Trump
 is
 speaking
 at


3
 PM.


Robin
 Hood
 back
 to
 130.
 Touched
 it
 for
 a


bit.
 Had
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 move
 right


there.


Bro,
 10
 million
 is
 probably
 more
 revenue


than
 all
 three
 quantum
 companies
 made


all
 year
 combined.
 Look
 at
 Douggee.


Douggee
 is
 now
 a
 bear.
 Douge
 sells
 his


Quantum
 and
 now
 he's
 bearish.


Now
 he's
 like,
 you
 know
 what?
 This
 it
 is


stupid.


No.
 Well,
 Doug,
 you
 made
 good
 money,


dude.
 You
 made
 good
 six
 figures.
 And


there's
 no
 way
 you
 could
 have
 known
 that


there
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 strategic


government
 investment,
 which
 we
 still


don't
 even
 know
 if
 that's
 happening
 or


not.
 But
 even
 the
 thought
 of
 that's


getting
 them
 excited.
 QBTZ
 is
 down
 40%


today.
 My
 goodness.


And
 that's
 cuz
 Dwave's
 up
 20%.
 That's


the
 opposite
 of
 the
 inverse
 fund.


Well,
 I
 forgot
 this
 is
 double
 leveraged.


I
 forgot
 this
 is
 not
 just
 inverse.
 This


is
 double
 leveraged
 inverse.
 So
 yeah,


actually
 if
 if
 you
 bought
 yesterday
 or


you
 bought
 even
 a
 couple
 days
 ago,


you're
 you're
 you're
 probably
 red
 to


break
 even.
 This
 is
 not
 just
 the


inverse.
 This
 is
 double
 leveraged


inverse


which
 could
 really
 wreck
 you.
 So
 there


you
 go.
 That's


definitely
 getting
 a
 bit
 hit
 right
 here.


S&P
 0.28
 669
 still
 kind
 of
 green


on
 the
 day.
 Now,
 where
 was
 Hold
 on.


QBTZ,
 where
 was
 this
 a
 week
 ago?
 If
 you


look
 at
 this
 a
 week
 ago,
 it
 was
 at
 24.


Now,
 it's
 at
 13.


Okay.
 So,
 you've
 had
 you've
 had
 to


basically
 buy
 it.
 Well,
 no,
 it
 went
 to


24
 yesterday.


Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 if
 you
 bought


it
 around
 this
 $11
 range,
 you're
 still


green.


Chris
 bought
 it
 what,
 October
 15th.


Yeah,
 Chris
 should
 still
 be
 green.
 He


bought
 it
 at
 11.
 Round
 about
 I
 think
 he


even
 tweeted
 about
 it.
 We
 can
 get
 the


price
 that
 he
 tweeted
 about.
 So,
 he


should
 still
 be
 green,
 but
 yesterday
 was


the
 day
 he
 could
 have
 made
 some
 big


money
 if
 he
 actually
 sold
 it.


Yeah,
 dude.
 Wild.
 So
 quick.
 So
 quick.


This
 stuff
 can
 change
 in
 an
 instant.


Yeah,
 look,
 he
 bought
 it
 at
 10
 bucks.


This
 was
 on
 what
 day?
 This
 was
 uh


October
 16th.


So,


he's
 the
 fact
 that
 he's
 still
 green
 on


this
 even
 after
 a
 20%
 move
 that
 D-Wave


had
 today
 shows
 how
 much
 the
 actual


underlying
 stock
 got
 wrecked.
 But


yesterday
 was
 at
 24.
 So,
 yesterday
 he


was
 up
 more
 than
 double.
 Today
 he's
 up


like
 30%.


Uh,
 but
 that's
 what
 you
 have
 on
 some
 of


the
 quantum
 names.
 S&P
 that's
 still
 up


about
 0.25%.
 Google
 is
 that
 green?


Google
 253.
 Google
 signs
 corporate


agreement
 to
 back
 a
 gas
 power
 plant


featuring
 carbon
 capture
 and
 storage


technology.


All
 right,
 Google
 is
 going
 to
 freaking


keep
 doing
 what
 they're
 doing.
 We're


getting
 more
 and
 more
 data
 center


announcements
 from
 Google
 across
 the


entire
 board.
 Some
 of
 these
 domestic,


some
 of
 these
 international.
 India
 was


the
 big
 one,
 15
 billion
 that
 they


announced
 last
 week.


And
 now
 you're
 seeing
 more
 power


announcements
 from
 Google
 as
 well.
 SoFi,


that's
 getting
 a
 little bit
 of a
 hit.


SoFi
 2770
 down
 from
 2815.


Um,


Meta
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move.
 Where
 is


Meta?


Yeah,
 we
 haven't
 seen
 739
 since


September
 30th.
 It's
 been
 a
 month
 since


we've
 seen
 it
 in
 the
 740s.
 Since
 then,


it
 got
 all
 the
 way
 down
 up
 to
 the
 691


level.
 So,
 look
 at
 that.
 There
 you
 go.


740
 on
 Meta.
 It's
 been
 a
 minute
 since


we've
 seen
 Meta
 even
 get
 close
 to
 these


levels,


but
 you
 are
 seeing
 that
 now.
 Oaklo,
 are


we
 officially
 green
 on
 Oaklo?
 We
 are


officially
 green
 on
 Oaklo
 12.
 All right,


some
 of
 these
 names
 getting
 some
 of


their
 momentum
 back.
 Intel
 right
 here


goes
 flat
 on
 the
 day.
 Disney
 still
 down.


And
 then
 Square
 down
 0.53.
 I
 was
 talking


to
 someone
 who
 works
 at
 Square
 a
 couple


days
 ago
 and
 he
 said
 he
 takes
 all
 of
 his


restricted
 stock
 options
 that
 he
 gets
 in


compensation
 and
 he
 sells
 them
 the
 day


he
 gets
 it
 and
 he
 buys
 Robin
 Hood.
 So


he's
 like
 I
 he
 has
 no
 belief
 in
 Square.


He's
 just
 there
 for
 the
 healthcare
 to
 be


honest
 and
 he
 takes
 that
 money
 and
 he


just
 dumps
 it
 right
 into
 Hood.


So
 it
 is
 crazy
 because
 like
 you
 know


he's
 such
 a
 Hood
 fan
 but
 when
 they
 when


when
 Square
 got
 into
 the
 S&P
 over
 Hood


he
 was
 happy
 but
 because
 he
 works
 there


but
 even
 he
 was
 like
 dude
 Hood
 needs
 to


get
 in.
 So
 it's
 kind
 of
 wild
 but
 this


stock
 right
 here
 7628


on
 the
 day.


Um,


Google
 covers
 all
 your
 needs
 as
 an


investor
 from
 AI,
 quantum
 robotics,
 FSD,


search
 and
 products.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 let


me
 ask
 this
 question
 to
 the
 chat
 because


there
 was
 this
 conversation
 on
 X


yesterday
 that
 I
 thought
 was
 really


interesting.
 So,
 here
 is
 the
 question.


Um,


by
 the
 way,
 79%
 of
 you
 said
 no
 on
 green


or
 red
 or
 on
 uh
 if
 you're
 buying
 the


Tesla
 dip.


Will
 Google
 be
 more
 valuable
 than
 Nvidia


one
 day?


The
 question
 is,
 is
 Google
 the
 dark


horse
 candidate
 to
 actually
 be
 the


world's
 most
 valuable
 company?
 Will
 they


outpace
 Nvidia?
 They're
 at
 three
 trill.


Nvidia
 is
 at
 4.4.
 I
 know
 1.4
 Four


trillion
 is
 some
 distance,
 but
 is
 it


really
 that
 much
 distance
 if
 Google's


able
 to
 put
 up
 some
 really
 good
 growth


numbers?


Who
 knows?


Maybe


maybe
 there's
 a
 world
 without
 changes,


but
 I
 would
 be
 curious
 to
 see
 kind
 of


what
 some
 people
 think
 on
 this.
 Um,


Apple
 signing
 a
 satellite
 deal
 with


SpaceX.
 As
 per
 the
 information,
 they
 are


reporting
 that
 Apple
 has
 signed
 a


satellite
 deal
 with
 SpaceX.
 The
 goal
 is


direct
 iPhone
 connectivity
 via
 Starlink.


Testing
 already
 underway
 in
 multiple
 US


states.
 Apple's
 been
 ghosting
 satellite


suitors
 for
 years.
 Elon
 Starlink
 now


gets
 the
 Apple
 seal
 of
 approval.
 Dude,


that'd
 be
 a
 big
 deal
 if
 Apple
 links
 up


with
 SpaceX.
 You've
 had
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 like
 United
 Airlines
 that
 have


started
 to
 work
 with
 SpaceX
 just
 because


it's
 way
 better
 coverage.
 I
 mean,
 that


could
 actually
 be
 a
 really
 interesting


announcement
 if
 Apple
 works
 with
 them


and
 Elon
 and
 Cook
 are
 working
 together.


That
 is
 the
 information
 right
 now


reporting
 that
 Apple
 and
 SpaceX
 could
 be


working
 together.


SMCI
 still
 taking
 a
 dump.
 Are
 we
 getting


hit?
 SMCI
 still
 taking
 a
 dump.
 Down
 6%.


Down
 6%.


Yeah,
 Google
 also
 owns
 7%
 of
 SpaceX.


That's
 the
 other
 thing.
 It
 also
 owns
 7%


7%
 of
 SpaceX.
 Uh,
 gold
 is
 still
 pumping.


Getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 right


there
 on
 gold.


Um,


as


that
 one
 still


flat
 from
 yesterday,
 but
 green
 on
 the


day
 up
 2.1%.


They
 can't
 even
 get
 Siri
 right.
 Yeah,
 I


I
 look
 I
 think
 Apple's
 getting
 the


multiple
 because
 they
 think,
 you
 know,


the
 street
 thinks
 they
 will
 get
 Siri


right
 going
 into
 next
 year.
 But
 I
 agree.


I
 mean,
 it
 really
 has
 been
 a
 disaster


over
 the
 past
 14
 years
 with
 them
 having


the
 head
 start.
 Stock
 draft.
 Matt
 still


at
 41%
 in
 the
 lead.
 I'm
 at
 33.
 Still


down
 34%
 on
 Duolingo.
 Steve's
 at
 six.


Tanner's
 at
 20.
 And
 Chris
 is
 at
 9.3.


So,
 Mr.
 Matt
 Money


continues
 to
 be
 green
 at
 these
 levels.


Um,


do
 you
 think
 Google
 will
 dip?
 It's
 so


expensive
 right
 here.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 when


OpenAI
 announced
 that
 like
 browser


thing,
 you
 had
 a
 little
 5%
 hundred


billion
 dollar
 market
 cap
 dip
 right


there.
 I
 don't
 think
 Google
 is
 crazy


expensive.
 It's
 It's
 just
 had
 a
 lot
 of


run
 since
 that
 150
 level,
 but
 at
 250,


it's
 at
 150
 was
 just
 stupid.
 250
 is
 not


stupid
 anymore,
 but
 is
 it
 like
 egregious


expensive?
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 so
 given


their
 earnings
 projections.
 Also,
 you


got
 to
 remember
 Google's
 buying
 back


Amazon's
 the
 Amazon
 and
 Tesla
 are
 the


only
 Max
 7s
 that
 aren't
 actually
 buying


back
 their
 stock.
 And
 once
 you
 start


buying
 back
 your
 stock,
 it
 becomes
 a


little bit
 of a
 cheat
 code
 in
 terms
 of


being
 able
 to
 create
 a
 base
 floor
 for


the
 stock.


You
 know,
 you
 might
 continue
 to
 see
 that


for
 Google
 as
 well.


Um,
 okay.
 Okay.
 What
 else
 do
 we
 see


right
 here?
 Beyond
 Meat,
 that
 one's


still
 getting
 dumped.


Beyond
 Meat
 getting
 hit.
 Beyond
 short


interest
 on
 Beyond
 Meat
 and
 nearly
 109%


of
 free
 float
 versus
 82%
 on
 Wednesday.


Wow.
 So,
 the
 hedge
 funds
 are
 loading
 up


on
 borrowing
 shares
 that
 don't
 even


exist
 for
 uh


for
 for
 Beyond
 Meat.


That
 stock
 still
 down
 17%


right
 here.
 We
 have
 15
 minutes
 until
 we


get
 red
 candles.
 Yeah,
 maybe
 10:30
 slam.


We're
 going
 to
 see


if
 uh
 if
 we
 end
 up
 getting
 it,
 will
 you


buy
 more
 soy
 at
 27
 2650?
 I
 bought


yesterday
 at
 2680.
 I'm
 in.
 So,


I
 mean,
 it
 would
 have
 to
 really
 go
 down


further
 than
 that,
 but
 I
 already
 bought.


I'm
 in.
 We're
 going
 to
 run
 it
 till


earnings
 and
 hopefully
 Tanner's
 right


and
 we
 get
 a
 big
 move.
 Crowd
 Strike


alltime
 high.
 Crowd
 Strike.
 Wow.
 517
 on


Crowd.
 We
 don't
 have
 any
 updates
 on


Crowd.
 No
 earnings
 yet,


but
 Crowd
 continuing
 to
 get
 a
 move.


Yeah.
 Imagine
 the
 government
 taking
 a


stake
 in
 Beyond
 Meat.
 That
 would
 be


hilarious.


That
 would
 genuinely
 be
 hilarious.


Again,
 it
 is
 also
 kind
 of
 just
 like
 this


whole
 quantum
 thing
 is
 funny
 to
 me


because
 again,
 I
 just
 I
 don't
 know,


dude.
 May
 maybe
 there
 is
 some
 nationally


competitive
 threat
 with
 China
 and


quantum
 computing
 that
 the
 United
 States


needs
 to
 be
 super
 super
 involved
 in.


Maybe
 that's
 the
 case.
 But
 if
 that's
 the


case,
 you
 would
 take
 a
 multi-billion


dollar
 stake.
 You
 wouldn't
 take
 a
 10


million
 is
 not
 a
 stake,
 bro.
 10
 million


is
 nothing.
 So
 that's
 why
 it
 feels
 like


it's
 nonsense.
 And
 then
 again,
 when
 you


look
 at
 the
 deputy
 e
 secretary
 of


defense,
 Steve
 Fineberg,
 who
 also
 has
 a


hedge
 fund,
 and
 he
 left
 that
 hedge
 fund


to
 become
 the
 deputy
 secretary
 of


defense,
 and
 then
 that
 hedge
 fund,
 you


look
 a
 little
 deeper,
 has
 a
 hund00


million
 position
 in
 one
 of
 these
 quantum


names.
 You
 start
 putting
 the
 pieces


together
 and
 say,
 what's
 going
 on
 right


here?
 Why
 is
 the
 government
 pumping


quantum
 when
 they've
 never
 really
 talked


about
 all
 the
 defense
 applications
 of


it,
 at least
 in
 a
 meaningful
 way?


Or
 why
 aren't
 they
 taking
 a


multi-billion
 dollar
 stake
 in
 these


quantum
 funds?
 Or
 why
 aren't
 they
 buying


freaking
 Google
 if
 they
 care
 so
 much


about
 quantum
 and
 IBM?
 Because
 you
 would


imagine
 Google
 and
 IBM
 are
 doing
 some


pretty
 important
 things
 versus
 some
 of


these
 other
 companies.


So,
 I
 don't know.
 It
 feels
 like
 a
 grift,


but
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 confirmation
 if


this
 is
 even
 happening.


It's
 just
 like
 Twitter
 lost
 their
 mind


last
 night,
 dude.
 When
 that
 story
 came


out,
 everyone
 lost
 their
 mind
 because


there's
 a
 decent
 amount
 of
 people
 that


agree
 with
 the
 argument
 that
 in
 order
 to


have
 a
 bull
 market,
 you
 cannot
 have


random
 names
 spike
 up.
 Like
 that
 is
 more


bubbish
 than
 bullish.
 And
 people
 just


lost
 their
 minds.
 People
 were
 like,
 "Oh,


wow.
 So
 this
 is
 this
 is
 this
 is
 what


we're
 doing
 now.
 This
 is
 what
 we're


doing
 now.
 This
 is
 how
 we're
 subsidizing


the
 ecosystem."


But
 I
 guess
 that's
 that's
 how
 it's


playing
 out.


Um,


what
 other
 positions
 are
 in
 his
 fund?
 I


tried
 to
 find
 if
 there
 were
 other


quantum
 names.
 He
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks,


but
 there's
 no
 other
 quantum
 names.
 IQ


is
 the
 only
 one.
 They
 have
 like
 2.4


million
 shares.
 They
 do
 have
 EOSE.
 They


do.
 Cerebras
 Capital
 Management
 does
 has


EOSE,
 which
 has
 taken
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 hit


over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks,
 but
 this


stock
 also
 is
 still
 up
 a
 lot
 for
 the


year.
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 like
 the


stock
 in
 the
 in
 the
 battery
 space,
 up


178%
 this
 year.


So,
 they
 do
 have
 a
 fund
 in
 that.


Um,
 restaurant
 stocks
 all
 down
 on
 the


day.


Cheesecake
 Factory,
 that's
 down,


huh?
 Yeah,
 people
 are
 selling
 off
 the


restaurant
 stocks
 today.
 Texas


Roadhouse,


dude.
 Texas
 Roadhouse.
 I
 think
 Joseph


Carlson's
 right
 about
 it.
 I
 went
 there


last
 week.
 The
 line
 on
 that
 freaking


restaurant
 is
 just
 cra
 like
 it
 is
 just


packed
 every
 weekend.
 Texas
 Roadhouse


17543
 right
 there.


Is
 McDonald's
 down?
 McDonald's
 is
 down.


Okay,
 so
 all
 the
 restaurant
 names


are
 down
 here.
 S&P
 losing
 670.
 That's


correct.
 All right,
 10:30
 slam.
 We're
 12


minutes
 away,
 but
 maybe
 it's
 coming
 up.


I
 did
 not
 take
 Steve.
 I
 went
 myself.


Stephen,
 I
 went
 to
 a
 place
 called
 Uncle


Jackson.
 Let's
 just
 say
 it
 was
 better


stake
 than
 Texas
 Roadhouse,
 that's
 for


sure.
 But
 it's
 the
 most
 rare
 stake
 I've


ever
 had.
 SMCI
 getting
 wrecked
 right


here.
 Down
 6%
 still.
 Ethereum
 almost


losing
 3,800.


Almost
 losing
 3,800.


Dude,
 the
 thing
 about
 Texas
 Roadhouse
 is


the
 bread.
 That
 butter
 on
 the
 bread.


That's
 just
 like
 it's
 a
 different
 type


of
 butter.
 I'm
 surprised
 other


restaurants
 haven't
 copied
 it.
 That


cinnamon
 butter
 is
 like,
 goodness


gracious,
 bro.
 It's
 like
 the
 best
 butter


that
 I've
 ever
 had
 with
 bread.


We're
 now
 taking
 steak
 recommendations


from
 you,
 mate.


Oh
 my
 gosh.


Um,
 Cracker
 Barrels
 at
 an
 April
 low.


Wait,
 Cracker
 Barrels
 public?
 Oh
 yeah,


they
 are


down
 two.
 I
 forgot
 cuz
 they
 had
 that


whole
 branding
 controversy.
 Year
 to


date,
 the
 stock's
 down
 34%,
 dude.
 Market


cap
 of
 85
 million.


H
 down
 another
 2%
 today.


Down
 another
 2%.
 Okay,
 let's
 see
 some
 of


the
 other
 headlines
 that
 we
 have.


We
 looked
 at
 all
 the
 earnings.
 We
 talked


about
 some
 of
 this
 Trump
 China
 stuff.


He's
 making
 a
 meeting
 at
 3M.
 Oh,


Jensen's
 gonna
 have
 GTC
 next
 week,
 which


is
 going
 to
 be
 really
 important.
 Uh,
 so


we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 Jensen
 says
 at


GTC.
 The
 FBI
 is
 live
 right
 now
 talking


about
 an
 NBA
 gambling
 bust.


Hold
 on.
 Let's
 look
 at
 this
 real
 quick.


What
 are
 they
 saying
 here?
 Of
 prop
 bets


on
 individual
 player
 performance.


The
 bets
 were
 placed
 through
 online


sports
 books
 and
 also
 in
 person
 at


casinos.


The
 defendants
 relied
 on
 a
 network
 of


straw
 bers
 to
 place
 the
 maximum
 amount


of
 bets
 to
 increase
 their
 potential


profits.


Most
 of
 these
 bets
 succeeded,
 and
 the


intended
 losses
 were
 in
 the
 millions
 of


dollars.


The
 defendants
 then
 laundered
 their


illegal
 winnings
 in
 various
 ways.


Peer-to-peer
 platforms,
 bank
 wires,
 and


simple
 cash
 exchanges.


The
 indictment.
 Okay,
 so
 you
 got
 Kosh


Patel


creating
 a
 investigation
 right
 here
 on


NBA
 gambling.
 I
 guess
 with
 prediction


markets,
 this
 stuff
 is
 only
 going
 to
 get


crazier
 as
 more
 and
 more
 people
 enter


into
 that
 ecosystem
 around
 betting.


Robin
 Hood
 back
 to
 130,
 but


you've
 got
 more
 and
 more


of
 a
 ecosystem
 of
 betting
 around
 the


entire
 country.


It's
 kind
 of
 wild,
 bro.
 I
 mean,
 there


there
 have
 been
 so
 many
 controversies
 of


people
 paying
 other
 people
 to,
 you
 know,


have
 players
 do
 certain
 things.
 I
 mean,


there's
 been
 so
 many
 controversies


around
 referees
 back
 in
 the
 early
 2000s


in
 the
 NBA
 in
 particular,


but
 it
 looks
 like
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 new


updates
 here
 on
 the
 day.
 Um,


yeah,
 Chanty
 Bops,
 dude,


that's
 pretty
 wild.


Are
 Cash
 and
 Chris
 related?
 They
 are
 not


related.
 Maybe
 they're
 like
 a
 distant


cousin.
 Who
 knows?
 Feel
 like
 every


potato
 is
 related
 in
 some
 way,
 dude.


Every


in
 some
 way,


but
 no,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 they're


related.


Um,


okay.
 Let's
 see
 the
 other
 stories
 we


have
 right
 here.
 Again,
 Tesla's
 still


trying
 to
 kind
 of
 break
 above
 the
 420.


Oh,
 this
 was
 a
 good
 update
 from
 AMD


today.
 Uh
 this
 is
 like
 a
 real
 use
 case


of
 AI.
 Uh
 Meg
 Cognetics
 is
 using
 AI
 on


AMD
 technology
 to
 help
 radiologists


deliver
 faster,
 more
 accurate
 breast


cancer
 diagnosis
 from
 hospital


workstations
 to
 rural
 screening
 bands.


This
 is
 the
 stuff
 that
 I
 really
 care


about
 when
 we
 get
 new
 updates
 on
 AI.


Like
 stuff
 that
 has
 real
 tangible


impacts
 and
 use
 cases
 for
 all
 of
 us.
 And


there
 you
 go.
 AMD
 partnering
 with
 a


company
 to
 make
 early
 cancer
 detection
 a


lot
 more
 accessible.
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 the


stuff
 that
 I
 think
 the
 street
 is
 looking


for
 because
 if
 you
 can
 detect
 cancer
 in


people
 before
 it
 happens.
 I
 mean
 that


that's
 massive
 commercially
 that
 would


be
 very
 very
 important
 for
 the
 overall


healthcare
 industry
 and
 then
 you
 know


that
 would
 save
 a
 lot
 of
 lives.
 So
 I
 do


think
 that's
 something
 the
 street
 cares


about
 in
 terms
 of
 seeing
 more
 of
 that


less
 social
 media
 AI
 generated
 videos
 as


like


the
 basis
 of


what
 AI
 is
 being
 used
 for.


Grab
 getting
 some
 green.
 Google
 getting


some
 green.
 SoFi
 up
 2.6.
 S&P
 trying
 to


get
 back
 to
 670.
 Little
 bit
 of
 a


reversal.
 Even
 Tesla
 425.
 That's
 the


high
 of
 day
 for
 Tesla.
 Maybe
 that's


getting
 ready
 to
 break
 green


potentially.


Healthcare
 still
 getting
 hit.
 UNH


is
 down
 but
 not
 No,
 UNH
 is
 was
 down
 2%.


Now
 it's
 barely
 down
 1%.
 So
 still


getting
 a
 move.
 BMR,
 how
 are
 we
 doing


there?
 BMR
 4838


4838


NT
 is
 the
 oncology
 play.
 It's
 D's


biggest
 position.
 Really?
 NT
 is
 D's


biggest
 position.


Is
 it
 his
 biggest
 biotech
 or
 his
 legit


biggest
 position?


Huh?
 $26
 billion
 market
 cap
 up
 18%
 on


the
 day
 or
 on
 not
 the
 day
 on
 year
 to


date.


Oh,
 that's
 incredible.


That
 is
 pretty
 incredible.
 When
 do
 you


expect
 Ethereum
 to
 move?
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


mean,
 I
 really
 don't
 I
 don't
 know
 if


there's
 a
 way
 you
 can
 expect
 it
 to
 move.


I
 think
 you
 just
 have
 to
 keep
 tracking.


Do
 the
 use
 cases
 continue
 to
 grow
 and


does
 the
 overall
 sector
 continue
 to


have
 more
 momentum.
 Um,
 and
 naturally,


you
 know,
 the
 price
 should
 continue
 to


grind
 higher.


But
 that's
 the
 problem
 with
 options
 on
 a


lot
 of these
 Ethereum
 plates.
 Like,
 you


just
 don't
 know
 when
 it's
 going to
 play


out.


And
 so
 we
 were
 not
 in
 the
 most
 obvious


crypto
 winter
 like
 in
 like
 when
 Bitcoin


was
 at
 15,000
 and
 MSTR
 was
 at
 like
 20


bucks.
 That
 was
 a
 crypto
 winter.
 So
 you


could
 you
 could
 say
 all
 right
 once
 we


get
 out
 of
 crypto
 winter,
 you
 know,
 we


should
 have
 a
 move
 and
 people
 who
 bet


hard
 on
 MSTR
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 The


problem
 with
 this,
 we're
 not
 in
 a
 crypto


winter,
 but
 these
 these
 assets
 are
 still


flat.
 So
 the
 question
 is,
 you
 know,
 is


it
 is
 it
 an
 obvious
 time
 to
 say
 they


should
 make
 a
 move
 or
 is
 it
 actually
 we


are
 approaching
 a
 crypto
 winter
 and


these
 assets
 are
 going
 to
 take
 a
 move
 to


the
 downside.
 I
 think
 the
 entire
 thesis


of
 a
 crypto
 winter
 is
 weird
 because
 of


all
 the
 institutionalization
 we
 have.


But
 if
 the
 cycle
 continues
 the
 way
 it


has
 for
 the
 past
 like
 14
 years,
 maybe


that's
 the
 case.
 My
 best
 bet
 would
 be


towards
 November,
 December,
 we
 get
 a


move
 on
 Bitcoin,
 Ethereum
 because
 we
 get


the
 rate
 cuts,


but
 that
 would
 have
 to
 be


the
 most
 important
 thing.


The
 CEO
 of
 ETH
 needs
 to
 be
 fired


after
 the
 Clarity
 Act.
 ETH
 might
 move


Last
 bull
 cycle
 didn't
 really
 have
 a


blowoff
 top.
 No,
 but
 it
 did,
 right?
 2021


was
 the
 blowoff
 top.


Bitcoin
 69
 thou.
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 almost


prophetic.
 Bitcoin
 69,000.
 Are
 you


kidding
 me?
 And
 that
 was
 the
 number
 that


we
 had
 a
 blowoff
 top
 on.


November
 2021.


The
 S&P
 had
 a
 blowoff
 top
 in
 January
 22.


We
 got
 to
 478
 on
 the
 S&P.


Even
 after
 we
 knew
 we
 were
 raising


rates,
 people
 still
 started
 buying
 the


market
 in
 in
 January.
 And
 then
 we


finally
 got
 flushed
 out
 and
 everything


just,
 you
 know,
 went
 down.


But
 I
 feel
 like
 that
 was
 the
 the
 blowoff


top.


Um,


I
 think
 SMCI
 going
 down
 is
 knee-jerk.
 Q1


revised
 down
 caused
 some
 revenue
 push
 to


Q2,
 but
 they
 reiterated
 the
 33
 bill.


Yeah,
 the
 SMC
 I
 think
 is
 weird.
 They


reiterated
 the
 core
 number
 for
 the
 year


and
 they
 mentioned
 supply
 issues
 versus


demand
 issues.
 So,


it
 is
 weird
 that
 it's
 getting
 hit
 as


bad.
 It's
 not
 taking
 all
 the
 semis
 down


with
 it.
 If
 we
 look
 at
 the
 semis,


yeah,
 relatively
 green.
 SMCI
 and
 on


semiconductor,
 the
 only
 ones
 that
 are


down.
 Marll,
 ARM,
 TSM,
 Intel,
 AMD,
 the


rest
 of
 these
 guys
 still
 doing
 okay.


Still
 doing
 okay.
 Are
 we
 at
 10:30
 a.m.?


We're
 about
 to
 be.
 We're
 about
 to
 be
 at


10:30.
 S&P
 up
 27.


We're
 going
 to
 see
 in
 two
 minutes
 kind


of how
 this
 plays
 out.
 Take
 a
 look
 at


this
 chart
 right
 here.
 Shanghai
 gold


warrants
 have
 now
 rose
 to
 an
 record


86,565


kilograms
 this
 week.
 What
 is
 a
 gold


warrant?
 Essentially,
 it
 is
 a
 digital


certificate
 that
 proves
 ownership
 of


physical
 gold
 stored
 in
 an
 exchange


approved
 warehouse.
 This
 is
 a
 28x


increase
 since
 2024,


signaling
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 investors
 in


China,
 whether
 they're
 retail


institutional
 or
 just
 the
 average
 Joe
 in


China,
 wants
 exposure
 to
 gold.


So,
 it's
 it's
 almost
 like
 a
 gold
 futures


contract
 that
 shows
 that
 you
 have


exposure
 even
 if
 it's
 not
 literally


physical
 gold.
 Gold,
 right,
 they're
 up


2.3%
 on
 the
 day.
 Silver
 as
 well.
 JP


Morgan
 also
 said
 this
 morning
 they
 think


gold
 to
 5,000
 by
 end
 of
 year
 is
 not


crazy.
 They
 have
 a
 8,000
 target
 by
 the


end
 of
 next
 year
 and
 5,000
 by
 the
 end
 of


this
 year.


I
 mean,
 that
 would
 just
 be
 a
 lot
 of


market
 cap
 that
 would
 add
 to
 gold
 if


that
 plays
 out.
 By
 the
 way,
 we
 don't


have
 jobs
 claims
 yet,
 but
 we
 do
 have
 a


little
 bit
 of
 data
 from
 some
 independent


parties
 uh
 showing
 that
 initial
 jobless


claims
 by
 federal
 workers
 spiked
 121%


week
 overw
 week
 after
 the
 shutdown.


7,244


people
 filed
 for
 unemployment
 after
 they


left
 or
 after
 they
 got
 fired
 from
 the


federal
 government
 and
 this
 is
 the


highest
 number
 since
 the
 2019
 government


shutdown.


So
 we
 don't
 have
 initial
 jobs
 claims
 yet


across
 the
 entire
 private
 sector
 but
 in


the
 public
 sector
 you
 are
 seeing
 more


and
 more
 people


that
 are
 getting
 laid
 off
 as
 per
 the


government
 continue
 to
 lay
 off.


Tucker
 Carlson
 came
 out
 yesterday
 and
 he


said
 he
 thinks
 Bitcoin
 is
 totalitarian.


Uh
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 relatively


interested.
 He
 said
 he
 doesn't
 own


Bitcoin
 because


he's
 afraid
 that
 he
 will
 be
 controlled


by
 the
 government.


>> I
 spoke
 at
 the
 Bitcoin
 conference


actually
 last
 year.
 I've
 spoken
 at
 a


couple
 Bitcoin
 conferences.
 I
 love
 the


idea
 of
 Bitcoin
 because
 I
 love
 the
 idea


of
 financial
 autonomy.
 I
 don't
 want
 what


I
 buy
 or
 sell
 to
 be
 tracked.
 I
 don't


want
 my
 money
 to
 be
 tracked.
 It's


nobody's
 business.
 I
 pay
 my
 taxes.
 I've


never
 cheated
 on
 my
 taxes.
 I've
 been


very
 tempted,
 but
 I
 never
 have
 one
 time


cheated
 on
 my
 taxes.


And
 once
 the
 money's
 mine,
 like
 I
 can
 do


what
 I
 want
 with
 it.
 And
 if
 you
 find
 me


breaking
 a
 law,
 arrest
 me,
 but
 if
 you


don't,
 it's
 none
 of
 your
 beeswax,
 as
 the


kids
 say.
 So,
 um,
 I
 love
 the
 idea
 of
 the


blockchain.
 I
 knew
 some
 of
 the
 people


involved
 in
 that
 whole
 thing.
 And
 then,


and
 I
 still
 believe
 in
 that
 promise.


Okay.
 Roger
 Ver
 for example.
 I
 don't


know if
 how
 closely
 do
 you
 follow
 this


but
 like
 there
 are
 people
 who
 still


believe
 in
 that
 but
 it
 turns
 out
 that
 it


is
 not
 to
 this
 point
 been
 I
 hope
 it
 will


be
 a
 way
 to
 conduct
 financial


transactions
 privately
 at
 all
 and
 that


really
 freaks
 me
 out.
 I'm
 really
 afraid


of
 a
 digital
 currency
 because
 that
 is


totalitarian
 control.
 If
 you
 can
 punish


people,
 if
 you
 can
 zero
 out
 their
 bank


account
 and
 keep
 them
 from
 eating,
 you


will
 have
 total
 obedience.
 Like
 that's


totalitarian.


And
 I
 know
 that
 young
 people
 love
 crypto


because
 they've
 been
 completely
 screwed


in
 the
 job
 market
 and
 there
 are
 no


financial
 opportunities
 for
 most
 of


them.
 And
 they
 know
 they're
 staring
 down


a
 life
 of
 if
 not
 poverty,
 certainly
 a


step
 down
 from
 the
 way
 they
 grew
 up,


most
 young
 people.
 And
 so
 Bitcoin
 for


them,
 crypto
 in
 general
 for
 them
 is
 a


promise
 of
 like,
 how
 can
 I
 make
 it
 in


this
 world?
 Like
 I
 would
 like
 to
 have
 a


normal
 life.
 How
 can
 I
 do
 that?
 And


crypto
 is
 the
 a
 way
 they
 think
 that
 they


can.
 And
 I'm
 praying
 for
 them.
 I
 hope
 I


hope
 that's
 true.
 But
 I
 fear
 that
 it


will
 become
 like
 so
 many
 other
 things
 in


our
 country
 uh
 a
 scam
 of
 sorts.


>> Who
 agrees?
 Who
 agrees?
 Tucker
 says


Bitcoin
 is
 totalitarian
 control
 and
 they


will
 track
 what
 you
 do
 with
 your
 money


if
 you
 give
 them
 control
 over
 it.
 By
 the


way,
 Hoodie
 making
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 right


here.
 131
 potentially
 on
 deck.
 130.80.


80


is
 what
 we
 have.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 feel
 like
 I'm
 as


educated
 on
 Bitcoin.
 I
 do
 think
 that


argument
 is
 a
 little
 off
 base
 and
 I


don't know
 if
 it
 understands
 all
 the


technical
 nuances
 of
 ledgers
 and
 things


of
 that
 nature.
 Ironically,
 you
 could


say
 the
 decentralized
 aspect
 of
 Bitcoin


is
 a
 way
 to
 completely
 hedge
 against


what
 he's
 talking
 about.
 I
 mean,
 if
 it's


Bitcoin
 or
 bank
 account,
 you
 would


imagine
 that
 Bitcoin
 is
 less
 easier
 to


track
 than
 a
 bank
 account,
 even
 if
 it
 is


possible
 to
 track
 it.


But


that
 is
 Mr.
 Tucker's
 perspective.
 Iran,


are
 we
 getting
 a
 move
 right
 there?
 Iran.


Wow.
 7%.
 All right.
 Iran
 going
 green.


5546.


That
 is
 up
 as
 well.


Um,


Crowdstrike.
 Why
 is
 Crowd
 Strike
 up,


bro?
 I
 don't
 see
 any
 reason
 Crowd
 Strike


should
 be
 moving
 the
 way
 they're
 moving.


Crowd
 Strike
 right
 there.


Ah,
 it
 feels
 technical.


Feels
 like
 a
 pure
 technical
 move.
 No


actual
 headline.
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 move


going
 into
 earnings
 as
 well.


That
 could
 be
 happening.


[Music]


Um,


why
 isn't
 Rumble
 stock
 higher
 beta?
 You


know,
 I've
 always
 asked
 myself
 about


this
 because
 there
 is
 a
 bit of
 a
 cult
 on


Rumble,
 but
 the
 company
 is
 just
 so
 like


boring.
 It's
 a
 YouTube
 competitor
 for


free
 speech.
 Like,
 it's
 just
 it's
 really


has
 not
 gotten
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 excited


about
 it.
 I
 think
 if
 there
 was
 anything


more
 interesting
 about
 this
 company,
 you


know,
 you
 would
 have
 some
 more
 high


beta,
 but


yeah,
 they're
 just
 not.
 and
 that's
 why


the
 stock
 is
 basically
 flat.
 Uh,


speaking
 of
 the
 government
 ownership


based
 on
 this
 quantum
 news
 we
 talked


about
 today,
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 These


are
 the
 current
 holdings
 of
 the
 Trump


administration.
 Uh,
 they're
 up
 a
 lot.


They
 got
 some
 pretty
 good
 deals.
 It


totals
 about
 $18
 billion


that
 the
 government
 is
 up
 on
 in
 regards


to
 or
 that
 the
 overall
 equity
 stake
 that


they
 have.
 93%
 of
 that
 18
 billion
 is


Intel.
 Then
 you
 got
 NP,
 Lithium


America's,
 then
 TMQ.
 Maybe
 the
 quantum


names
 join
 this
 conversation,


but


Trump's
 hedge
 fund
 has
 been
 crushing
 it.


Even
 though
 technically
 technically
 it's


our
 dude,
 these
 are
 our
 investments


stakes.
 These
 are
 the
 US
 taxpayer
 dollar


holdings.
 So
 we
 all
 own
 a
 little
 bit,


you
 know,
 all
 of
 us
 own
 a
 little
 bit
 of


Intel,
 MP,
 LAC,
 and
 TMQ.
 all
 of
 us
 which


is
 kind
 of
 crazy
 but
 it
 is
 the
 US


taxpayer
 dollar
 going
 into
 this
 Robin


Hoodie
 131


Robin
 Hoodie
 131


that
 is
 green
 that's
 up
 3%
 then
 pounder


making
 a
 move
 that's
 up
 2%
 as
 well


would
 you
 hold
 your
 soy
 if
 it
 pumps
 I


want
 to
 see
 what
 the
 quarter
 looks
 like


I
 mean
 if
 we
 get
 a
 really
 big
 pump
 and


like
 the
 quarter
 justifies
 the
 pump
 I


think
 I
 hold
 on
 to
 it
 but
 a
 move
 to
 35


off
 of
 decent
 quarter
 but
 not
 an


excellent
 quarter.
 I
 don't
 know,
 maybe


it's
 a
 sell.
 The
 thing
 is
 the
 SoFi


reports
 a
 day
 before
 rate
 cuts.
 So,
 I


feel
 like
 you
 can't
 sell
 on
 earnings
 if


you
 have
 a
 good
 earnings
 because
 then


you
 get
 a
 rate
 cut
 the
 next
 day
 and


maybe
 it's
 baked
 in.
 But
 like
 that


should
 be
 bullish
 for
 SoFi.
 So,


I
 feel
 like
 if
 they
 give
 us
 a
 good


quarter,
 you
 you
 just
 hold
 on
 and
 then


maybe
 you
 get
 a
 rate
 cut
 and
 then
 maybe


after
 the
 rate
 cut
 you
 sell.
 But
 I


really
 want
 to
 see
 what
 what
 happens
 on


the
 earnings.


and
 what
 they
 will
 say.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,


look,
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 that
 are
 not
 in


America,
 you
 don't
 own
 the
 uh
 the
 these


companies,
 but
 if
 you're
 in
 America


here,
 we
 are
 officially
 shareholders
 of


all
 these
 names.


Um,


yeah,
 not
 me
 because
 I'm
 Canadian.


Uh,
 okay.
 Let's
 pull
 up
 this
 thing
 right


here
 as
 well.
 So,
 we
 looked
 at
 a
 couple


things
 in
 regards
 to
 some
 of
 these


gold
 price
 targets.


Um,


well,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 this
 thing
 is


also
 pretty
 interesting
 to
 look
 at
 in


the
 context
 of
 what
 we're
 talking
 about.


We
 talked
 about
 subprime
 lending


yesterday,
 that
 not
 necessarily
 being


the
 best.
 The
 core
 report
 that
 got


stocks
 to
 go
 down,
 by
 the
 way,
 yesterday


is
 Trump
 administration
 considered
 a


plan
 to
 restrict
 globally
 produced


exports
 to
 China
 made
 with
 or
 containing


US
 software.
 New
 export
 controls
 could


curb
 exports
 on
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 goods
 to


China.
 That
 is
 why
 stocks
 puked


yesterday.
 It
 looks
 like
 that
 report
 has


not
 necessarily
 been
 as
 legitimate
 as


people
 thought
 it
 was.
 Uh,
 and
 there's


not
 going
 to
 be
 massive
 tariffs
 on
 goods


and
 services
 or
 export
 controls
 that
 are


made
 with
 US
 software.
 But
 that
 was
 one


of
 the
 reasons
 the
 street
 was
 freaking


out
 a
 little
 bit.
 Here's
 some
 coverage


on
 the
 Fed
 deficit,
 which
 is
 another


reason
 markets
 got
 a
 little
 weirded
 out


yesterday
 as
 some
 new
 stats
 came
 out
 and


then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> Year
 uh
 second
 quarter
 rather,
 fiscal


year
 uh
 25,
 we
 had
 uh
 34%.
 So
 basically


in
 the
 two
 quarters
 that
 over
 overlapped


with
 the
 Biden
 administration,
 74%
 of


the
 budget
 deficit
 occurred.
 Then
 from


April
 forward,
 two
 things
 happened.
 One,


as
 you
 mentioned,
 you
 had
 tariff


revenues.
 We're
 going
 to
 probably


collect
 something
 in
 a
 calendar
 year
 of


about
 300
 billion.
 It's
 an
 annual
 rate


of
 nearly
 400
 billion
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


last
 few
 months.
 But
 what's
 important,


Michael,
 is
 that
 on
 the
 spending
 side,


spending
 year
 on
 year
 in
 the
 third


quarter
 of
 this
 year
 was
 basically
 flat


up2
 and
 it
 was
 down
 2.5%
 in
 the
 in
 the


fourth
 quarter
 or
 the
 last
 quarter
 of


the
 fiscal
 year.
 So
 the
 spending


trajectory
 looks
 very
 key
 and
 that's
 why


the
 Republicans
 do
 not
 want
 to
 cave
 to


Democrat
 demands
 to
 reverse
 these


spending
 initiatives
 which
 are
 going
 to


keep
 a
 much
 better
 deficit
 trajectory
 in


place
 thanks
 to
 President
 Trump's


policies.


>> Um
 Joe,
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 Wall
 Street


research
 uh
 and
 economists
 writing
 about


2026,
 calendar
 2026,
 and
 why
 we
 should


expect
 some
 of
 the
 simulative
 effects
 of


uh
 the
 OBB
 coming
 through.
 And
 one
 of


those
 is
 expected
 very
 heavy
 individual


tax
 refunds
 in
 the
 first
 quarter,
 $150


billion
 or
 so,
 incremental
 to
 last
 year,


as
 well
 as
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 corporate
 tax


incentives.
 I
 guess
 the
 the
 the
 what
 I'm


wondering
 is
 whether
 you're
 getting
 the


benefits
 on
 the
 deficit
 side
 this
 year


because
 you're
 kind
 of
 overwithholding


by
 design
 and
 you're
 giving
 it
 back
 next


year.
 And
 also,
 you
 know,
 can
 we


extrapolate
 the
 spending
 levels
 from


this
 past
 quarter
 uh
 into
 next
 year?
 So


Michael
 on
 the
 OOT
 tripleB
 uh
 the
 full


expensing
 of
 capital
 those
 guidelines
 I


believe
 are
 almost
 done
 the
 full


expensing
 for
 factories
 which
 is
 very


important
 and
 will
 drive
 domestic


production
 and
 tax
 revenues
 that's
 still


being
 worked
 on.
 We
 do
 need
 this


shutdown
 to
 end
 because
 at
 some
 point


we're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 with
 the
 IRS


and
 Treasury
 working
 on
 this.
 They're


not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 fully
 implement


everything
 in
 time
 if
 the
 Democrats
 keep


the
 government
 closed.
 So
 that
 that's


important.
 In
 terms
 of
 the
 refunds
 next


year,
 yes,
 they
 could
 they
 could
 be
 very


meaningful
 for
 workers,
 but
 their


incentive,
 Michael,
 is
 to
 work
 more.
 For


tariffs,
 we're
 going
 to
 generate
 a
 lot


more
 tariff
 revenue
 next
 year.
 And
 given


where
 the
 economy
 has
 been,
 you
 know,


we're
 looking
 at
 4%
 type
 of
 growth
 for


the
 third
 quarter,
 3%
 plus
 type
 growth


next
 year
 if
 we
 get
 this
 capex


everything
 in
 place
 as
 we
 expect.
 That's


a
 boom.
 That's
 going
 to
 drive
 the


revenues.
 Now,
 on
 the
 spending
 side,


Michael,
 we
 don't
 know.
 We're
 very


optimistic
 the
 last
 six
 months
 have
 put


us
 on
 a
 better
 trajectory.
 That's
 why


the
 Republicans
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 we


don't
 add
 back
 in
 all
 this
 frivolous


inefficient
 spending
 that
 was
 that
 was


uh
 removed
 from
 the
 the
 OOT
 triple
 B.
 So


that
 will
 depend
 on
 how
 negotiations
 go.


I'm
 hopeful
 that
 the
 trajectory
 of


spending
 Michael
 is
 less
 and
 with
 the


strong
 growth
 we
 can
 get
 this
 budget


deficit
 to
 GDP
 ratio
 down
 to
 five
 maybe


even
 the
 high
 fours
 next
 year
 if
 we
 get


the
 boom
 that
 we're
 expecting.


Do
 you
 expect
 uh
 tariffs
 to
 provide


consistent
 revenue
 or
 be
 a
 one-time


benefit
 uh
 to
 the
 deficit?
 Because
 I


know
 the
 administration
 has
 basically


said
 that
 tariffs
 are
 a
 one-time
 price


adjustment.
 So,
 from
 an
 inflation


standpoint,
 the
 view
 is
 that
 it
 will
 be


kind
 of
 a
 one-time
 boost
 and
 then
 things


will
 settle
 down
 from
 there.
 And
 I'm


curious
 if
 you're
 expecting
 the
 same


thing
 on
 a
 revenue
 collection
 side.


>> Sure,
 Leslie.
 I
 mean,
 right
 now,
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 CPI
 or
 the
 PC,
 we
 haven't


even
 seen
 that
 price
 level
 effect
 impact


tariffs
 uh
 in
 any
 meaningful
 in


aggregate.
 But
 your
 point
 is
 well
 taken


that
 if
 it
 shows
 up,
 it
 would
 be
 a


one-off
 price
 level
 adjustment,
 but
 the


tariff
 is
 still
 in
 effect.
 So,
 we're


generally
 generating
 about
 $30
 billion,


30
 billion
 plus
 per
 month
 in
 tariff


revenue.
 So,
 that
 will
 remain
 in
 place.


Now
 over
 time,
 over
 a
 period
 of
 years,


if
 there's
 more
 re-industrialization,


there's
 more
 domestic
 growth
 through


factory
 expansion,
 capex,
 all
 the
 things


that
 are
 part
 of
 the
 bill,
 then
 domestic


revenues
 are
 going
 to
 rise,
 production


goes
 up
 relative
 to
 consumption.
 And


then
 organically,
 you
 know,
 years
 from


now,
 you
 may
 get
 less
 tariff
 revenue,


but
 the
 point
 is
 you
 get
 more
 domestic


revenue.
 So
 right
 now,
 these
 tariffs


will
 continue
 to
 generate
 the
 revenue
 in


the
 near
 term
 that
 we're
 looking
 for


somewhere
 in
 the
 3
 to
 400
 billion


peranom
 level.


Joe,
 appreciate
 you
 uh
 getting
 into
 all


the
 numbers
 with
 us.
 Thank
 you,
 Joe


Levo.


>> Thanks,
 guys.


>> The
 CEO
 of
 IMAX
 is
 next,
 breaking
 down.


>> Okay,
 so
 a
 lot
 more
 analysis,
 I
 guess,


right
 there
 on
 how
 the
 government
 is


thinking
 of
 this
 tariff
 revenue
 in
 the


context
 of
 their
 budget
 deficit
 spend.


Robined
 right
 there,
 making
 a
 bit
 of
 a


move

 You're
 getting
 everything


pretty
 much
 going
 green.

 as
 well
 right


now

 of

 Uh
 look
 in
 terms


of
 the
 deficit
 spending
 stuff
 that
 he


talked
 about
 the
 only
 way
 it
 really


works
 out
 is
 if
 we
 continue
 to
 grow
 uh


GDP
 at
 4%
 or
 at least
 you
 know
 three
 and


a
 half
 and
 you
 know
 they're
 pretty


confident
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


grow
 at
 those
 levels.
 I
 guess
 we're


going to
 have
 to
 see
 if
 that
 ends
 up


playing
 out.
 SMCI
 still
 down
 6%,
 but
 if


we
 could,


that
 probably
 could
 get
 the
 street
 a
 lot


more
 excited
 about
 where
 the
 state
 of


deficit
 spending
 is
 going.
 Amazon
 right


there
 at
 220.
 By
 the
 way,
 speaking
 of


debt,
 uh
 we
 have
 just
 crossed
 $
 38


trillion
 of
 debt
 yesterday
 officially.


So


there
 you
 go.
 At
 this
 point,
 I
 don't


even
 know
 if
 these
 numbers
 are
 real


anymore.
 I
 mean,


this
 this
 is
 your
 bullcase
 right
 here


for
 Bitcoin.
 Like
 I
 don't
 know
 in
 my


lifetime
 or
 in
 my
 kids
 lifetime
 if
 we're


going
 to
 be
 paying
 this
 off.


But


yeah,
 38
 trillion
 across
 the
 board
 for


the
 US.


So
 that's
 why
 you
 buy
 gold.
 Yeah,
 that's


why
 you
 buy
 gold.
 That's
 why
 you
 buy


digital
 gold
 as
 well.
 Uh
 I
 missed
 this


announcement
 in
 the
 morning.
 I'm
 just


seeing
 it
 right
 now,
 but
 uh
 May
 mobility


is
 going
 to
 be
 expanding
 its
 AV


technology
 into
 Southeast
 Asia
 with
 a


Grab
 investment.
 So
 I'm
 just
 literally


seeing
 this
 right
 now.
 This
 is
 a
 second


investment
 Grab
 has
 made.
 They
 also


invested
 in
 Wide,
 which
 was
 another


company
 working
 on
 AVs.
 Uh
 it
 makes


sense
 for
 Grab
 because
 they
 obviously


need
 to
 start
 positioning
 themselves
 for


an
 AV
 future
 in
 Southeast
 Asia,
 which
 is


not
 as
 easy
 to
 build
 as
 a
 North
 American


uh
 autonomous
 vehicle
 future
 just
 given


the
 nature
 of
 the
 roads
 there.
 We
 don't


know
 how
 much
 the
 investment
 is.
 I
 would


imagine
 it's
 probably
 in
 the
 hundreds
 of


millions.
 Same
 thing
 like
 we
 ride.
 But


you
 do
 have
 that
 one
 green
 potentially


on
 that
 investment
 as
 well.
 220
 right


here
 on
 Amazon
 and
 then
 Reddit
 up
 2.94%


on
 the
 day.
 Yes,
 we
 were
 at
 36
 trillion


to
 start
 the
 year.
 That's
 correct.


Nice
 little
 two
 trill
 in
 9
 months
 is


what
 we
 got.
 Where's
 Beyond
 Meat?
 Beyond


Meat
 is
 317.


Okay,
 cool.


Up
 11%
 or
 down
 11%
 up
 from
 280.


38
 trillion
 is
 crazy.


38
 trillion
 is
 crazy.


More
 calls
 are
 crossing
 puts
 on
 the
 S&P


now.
 Okay,
 so
 you're
 getting
 some
 more


bullish
 option
 flow
 on
 the
 S&P.
 669.84.


If
 we
 can
 end
 out
 the
 week
 at
 670.
 We


ended
 out
 last
 Friday
 at
 665.
 I
 think


that
 would
 be
 really
 good
 progress,


especially
 going
 into
 the
 China


negotiations
 that
 start
 next
 week.
 Um,


and
 you
 know,
 the
 question
 is,
 can
 we


get
 those
 negotiations
 to
 result
 in
 any


meaningful
 progress?
 But


if
 so,
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 in
 a


much
 better
 situation.
 Here
 was
 Walter


Isacson
 this
 morning
 speaking
 on
 uh


Tesla
 earnings
 and
 some
 of
 his
 thoughts


on
 the
 quarter.
 building
 Optimus
 the


robot.
 That
 pay
 package
 he's
 talking


about
 says
 you
 have
 to
 build
 a
 million


of
 them
 uh
 for
 the
 uh
 pay
 package
 to


click
 in.
 And
 secondly,
 uh
 totally


autonomous
 driving
 robo
 taxis
 with
 no


steering
 wheels.
 And
 ever
 since
 he
 was
 a


kid,
 he
 really
 he
 used
 to
 read
 the
 Isaac


Azimov
 novels,
 the
 robot
 novels
 when
 he


was
 a
 young
 kid
 in
 South
 Africa
 with
 no


friends
 sitting
 in
 the
 corner
 of
 the


bookstore.
 And
 the
 whole
 point
 of
 those


novels
 is
 you
 build
 the
 robots,
 they
 can


turn
 on
 us.
 Now,
 it
 may
 not
 seem
 uh


logical,
 but
 that's
 been
 ingrained
 in


him
 and
 he
 wants
 control
 of
 Tesla


because
 he
 sees
 it
 now
 as
 a
 robot
 and
 AI


company


>> and
 do
 you
 expect
 that
 he
 will
 get
 it


from
 the
 shareholders?
 Well,
 the


shareholders
 are
 voting
 in
 a
 few
 weeks


and
 uh
 you've
 watched
 some
 of
 the


institutional
 investors
 and
 the
 uh


things
 like
 Glass
 Lewis
 have
 said,
 "Hey,


don't
 do
 this."
 The
 shareholders
 voted


last
 time
 around,
 as
 you
 remember,
 for


that
 50
 or
 so
 billion
 dollar
 pay
 package


that's
 still
 being
 held
 up
 in
 fights
 in


the
 Delaware
 courts.
 He's
 making
 a
 big


campaign
 both
 on
 X
 and
 then
 last
 night


when
 he
 said,
 "Hey,
 I'm
 going
 to
 walk.


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 put
 all
 this
 AI
 power


into
 this
 company
 and
 then
 have
 it
 be


when
 I
 can
 get
 ousted.
 So,
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 institutional
 investors
 and
 they
 may


be
 pushing
 back
 on
 this,
 but
 a
 lot
 of


people
 invest
 in
 uh
 Tesla
 stock


emotionally.
 So,
 we'll
 see
 how
 the


shareholders
 vote.


>> Yeah,
 Eli,


>> I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 think
 he
 will
 get
 his


shareholder
 vote
 to
 be
 on
 his
 side.
 They


spent
 a
 good
 chunk
 of
 the
 call
 yesterday


talking
 about
 why
 they
 should
 get
 it


done.
 I
 I
 I
 do
 agree
 though
 glass
 door


and
 institutional
 investor
 services
 ISS


the
 idea
 that
 they
 get
 to
 control
 so


many
 shares
 but
 they
 don't
 actually
 own


those
 shares
 aka
 they
 get
 to
 be a


custody
 of
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 of


shares
 therefore
 they
 get
 to
 vote
 on


behalf
 of
 those
 shares
 is
 kind
 of


ridiculous
 especially
 because
 they
 don't


own
 the
 shares
 and
 so
 Elon
 was
 making


the
 case
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 need


individual
 retail
 investors
 to
 get
 the


market
 to


um
 recognize
 that
 the
 pay
 compensation


package
 really
 does
 matter
 and
 you
 know


that
 Elon
 deserves
 to
 get
 paid
 if
 they


end
 up
 10xing
 the
 value
 of
 the
 company.


Tennis
 says,
 "What
 did
 you
 think
 of
 the


robot
 army
 comments?
 I
 thought
 that
 was


kind
 of
 funny.
 And
 I
 mean,
 look,
 Eli,
 I


so
 I
 was
 saying
 this
 yesterday
 with


Steve,
 like
 I
 really
 wanted
 Elon
 on
 the


earnings
 call
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 future


of
 Optimus
 in
 a
 more
 productive
 way,
 aka


are
 they
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


meaningfully
 ship
 Optimus
 in
 2027,
 2022?


You
 didn't
 really
 get
 too
 much
 of
 that,


but
 this
 is
 exactly
 what
 Elon
 was
 saying


in
 regards
 to
 the
 robot
 army
 instead.


Let's
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.


When
 you
 read
 about
 um
 other
 robots
 that


just
 don't
 have
 those
 three
 things,


um
 so
 no,
 I
 think
 we
 can
 achieve
 all


those
 things,
 those
 those
 three
 things


with
 an
 immense
 amount
 of
 work.
 Um


and
 um
 and
 that
 that
 is
 that
 is
 the
 game


plan.
 So
 um


you
 know
 my
 like
 like
 my


you
 know
 fundamental
 concern
 with
 regard


to


how
 much
 voting
 control
 I
 have
 in
 Tesla


is
 if
 I
 go
 ahead
 and
 build
 this
 enormous


robot
 army,
 can
 I
 just
 be
 ousted
 at
 some


point
 in
 the
 future?
 Um
 that's
 my


biggest
 concern.
 if
 I
 that's
 that
 that


is
 the
 the
 that
 is
 really
 the
 only
 thing


I'm
 trying
 to
 address
 with
 with
 this
 uh


so
 what's
 called
 compensation
 but
 it's


not
 like
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 expend
 the


money
 it's
 just


if
 we
 build
 this
 robot
 army
 um
 do
 I
 have


at least
 uh
 a
 strong
 influence
 over
 that


robot
 army
 not
 not
 control
 but
 a
 strong


influence
 that's
 that's
 what
 it
 comes


down
 to
 in
 a
 nutshell
 um
 like
 I
 don't


feel
 comfortable
 building
 that
 robot


army
 if
 I
 don't
 have
 at
 least
 a
 strong


influence


Great.


>> So,


look,
 that
 was
 Elon's
 point.
 Metabat,
 by


the
 way,
 back
 at
 740.
 I
 mean,
 his


argument
 is
 like,
 hey,
 I
 if
 I
 build
 out


this
 massive
 robot
 army
 and
 there's
 all


this
 excitement
 and
 momentum
 around


robots
 and
 I
 don't
 own
 a
 significant


portion
 of
 the
 company
 to
 have
 the


ability
 to
 have
 influence,
 then
 what's


the
 point?


Which
 is
 fair,
 right?
 And
 like
 it


doesn't
 make
 sense
 for
 Elon
 to
 be
 that


motivated
 if
 he
 can't
 actually
 get
 the


job
 done.


So
 I
 think
 that
 does
 make
 sense.
 Robin


right
 there.
 131.
 Oh,
 I'm
 getting
 a


phone
 call
 right
 here.


Yo


>> yo


>> yo,
 what's
 up?
 What's
 up?


Okay,
 so
 real
 quick
 on
 the
 Elon


comments,
 if
 you
 would
 have
 played
 that


clip
 just
 a
 few
 more
 seconds,
 he
 talks


about
 how
 there
 are
 some
 companies
 that


have
 founder
 shares,


>> right?
 Yeah.


>> He
 met
 in
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 businesses


that
 have
 done
 it,
 but
 he
 said
 to
 his


knowledge


>> that
 it
 cannot
 be
 done
 after
 the
 company


has
 gone
 public.


>> That
 is
 a
 complete
 sham.
 That's
 not
 true


at
 all.
 Okay?
 And
 and
 you
 know
 how
 I


know
 this
 is
 because
 Toby
 Lucky,
 CEO
 of


Shopify,
 did
 this
 company.
 This
 is


completely
 completely
 verifiable.
 You


can
 look
 up
 the
 company
 went
 public
 in


2015.
 Okay?
 Toby
 Lucky
 did
 not
 have


founder
 shares.
 He
 didn't
 want
 to
 build


something
 once
 it
 became
 absolutely


huge.
 He
 didn't
 want
 to
 continue
 to


build
 something
 without
 having
 voter


share.
 Okay?
 So
 in
 2022,
 they
 did
 an


annual
 shareholder
 meet
 where
 they


approved
 founder
 shares,
 giving
 him
 40%


of
 the
 voting
 power


after
 the
 company
 had
 been
 public
 for


seven
 years.
 It's
 complete
 sham.
 The


dude
 wants
 a
 trillion
 dollars.
 And
 I'm


honestly
 I'm
 fine
 with
 that.
 But
 just


say
 it
 how
 it
 is.
 I
 mean
 like
 the
 whole


world's
 watching.
 It's
 not
 even
 like


Shopify
 is
 not
 a
 large
 company.
 I'm
 so


surprised
 no
 one
 has
 corrected
 him
 on


this.
 It's
 absolute
 BS.
 So
 you
 you
 think


he
 you
 think
 he
 could
 have
 got
 founder


class
 shares
 to
 the
 level
 that
 like
 a


Zucks
 has
 it
 over
 the
 past
 10
 years
 and


he's
 making
 up
 an
 excuse
 to
 get
 a
 higher


compensation
 package
 by
 making
 this


robot
 army
 like
 concern
 that
 he
 now


somehow
 has


>> he
 wants
 a
 trillion
 dollars
 if
 the


company's
 8.5
 trillion.


I
 I
 don't
 know what
 the
 exact
 percentage


is,
 but
 in
 my
 head
 that's
 a
 lot
 lower


than
 40%.
 you
 know,
 and
 and
 so
 the


voting
 share
 that
 he's
 asking
 for


doesn't
 even
 align
 with
 what
 Toby
 Lucky


had
 approved.
 And
 I
 honestly
 think
 that


shareholders
 would
 be
 much,
 much
 easier,


easily
 convinced
 to
 give
 him
 40%
 voter


share
 than
 to
 give
 him
 a
 trillion


dollars.


>> Right.
 Right.
 Because
 they
 trust
 his


judgment
 more.


>> I
 trust
 his
 judgment.
 I
 trust
 his


judgment.


Well,
 why
 why
 do
 you
 think
 he
 hasn't


campaigned
 for
 getting
 that
 voting
 share


over
 the
 past
 like
 10
 years?


>> I
 don't
 know.


>> It's
 kind
 of
 weird,
 right?
 You
 would


think
 he
 he
 wants
 if
 he
 wants
 to
 have


massive
 control
 over
 his
 own
 company.
 I


mean,
 Zucks
 has
 almost
 like
 60%
 if
 I'm


not
 wrong
 of
 the
 voting
 share.


So,
 it
 is
 kind
 of
 weird,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 some
 people
 are
 saying
 that
 uh
 um


he's
 not
 actually
 the
 founder.
 That


doesn't
 matter.


>> I
 don't
 think
 that.


>> Yeah.
 How?
 Wait,
 wait,
 hold
 on,
 hold
 on,


hold
 on.
 People
 think
 because
 he's
 not


the
 founder
 that
 he
 can't
 get
 founders


[ __ ]
 guys.
 He
 is
 Tesla.
 Elon
 is
 Tesla.


Okay,
 so
 what?
 He's
 not
 the
 founder.
 And


by
 the
 way,
 whenever
 Elon's
 asked
 about


being
 the
 founder
 in
 interviews,
 he
 gets


pretty
 upset
 because
 he's
 like,
 "Bro,


there
 was
 two
 people
 there.
 They
 did


absolutely
 nothing.
 They
 were
 there
 for


a
 year
 and
 a
 half,
 and
 then
 he
 turned


the
 business
 into
 the
 trillion
 dollar


company
 that
 it
 is
 today."
 So
 just


because
 he
 didn't
 literally
 uh


incorporate
 it
 himself
 in
 Delaware
 does


not
 mean
 that
 he's
 not
 the
 key
 part
 of


this
 business.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It
 it's
 it
 it's
 what
 we
 call


founder
 shares,
 but
 it
 I
 don't
 to
 my


knowledge
 it
 doesn't
 actually
 mean
 that


you
 were
 the
 director
 that
 signed
 the


official
 document
 to
 create
 the


corporation.
 You
 know,
 it's
 just
 a
 way


of
 saying
 that
 this
 guy
 is
 the
 one


running
 the
 business.


>> Yeah.
 You
 can
 call
 them
 true.
 You
 can


call
 them
 anything
 you
 want.
 They
 just


have
 to
 be
 they
 have
 to
 give
 him
 the


voting
 rights.
 That's
 that's
 what
 really


matters.
 That's
 a
 fair
 point.
 In


general,
 if
 you
 still
 held
 Tesla,
 would


you
 vote
 for
 the
 compensation
 package
 or


no?


>> Um


I
 don't
 know
 honestly.
 I'm
 I'm
 more


hesitant
 on
 this
 round
 than
 the
 last


one.
 And
 honestly,
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 because


these
 these
 weird
 comments
 about
 like


robot
 armies
 and
 stuff.
 It
 is
 such
 a


dystopian
 future.
 Um,


and


yeah,


>> but
 but
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 a
 good
 deal


that
 he
 gets
 a
 trillion
 if
 shareholders


also
 get
 to
 10x
 at
 the
 same
 time?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 I I
 just
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 even
 know
 if
 I'm
 convinced
 that


it's
 going
 to
 happen.
 So
 So
 I
 guess
 I


would
 I
 would
 uh
 allow
 it
 to
 happen.
 I


guess
 I
 would
 sign
 up
 and
 um
 hope
 that


he
 pushes
 towards
 it,
 but
 I'm
 not
 even


sure
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 go
 through.


I
 I
 I'm
 a
 big
 humanoid
 robot
 believer,


but
 I
 also
 think
 this
 is
 like
 whenever


he
 said
 FSD
 is
 coming
 in
 like
 early,
 you


know,
 like
 2017,
 2018,
 like
 I
 think
 it's


actually
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 longer
 for


these
 things
 to
 be
 developed.
 And
 all
 of


these
 comments
 about
 how
 robots
 are
 a


2026
 phenomenon
 and
 AGI
 is
 three
 months


around
 the
 corner.
 Like
 all
 these
 I


don't
 believe
 it.
 I'm
 seeing
 no
 signs
 of


this.
 I
 think
 there's
 improvements,
 but


the
 massive
 improvement
 that
 they're


talking
 about,
 I
 just
 don't
 I'm
 not


seeing
 it.
 Brett
 Adcock
 can
 talk
 about


how
 his
 robots
 from
 2050
 and
 then
 it


breaks
 a
 cup
 on
 the
 I
 don't
 know.


They're
 going
 to
 be
 great,
 but
 they're


not
 going
 to
 be
 replacing
 plumbers
 and


electricians
 for
 a
 over
 a
 decade.


>> Yeah.
 And
 look,
 I
 I'm
 invested
 in
 Figure


and
 Electronic
 and
 some
 of
 these


robotics
 companies,
 and
 even
 I
 will


admit
 they're
 not
 doing
 anything
 useful


yet.
 So,
 like,


>> yeah,
 I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 they'll
 be
 doing


useful
 tasks,
 but
 just
 nothing
 that
 is


what
 Elon
 said
 is
 an
 infinite
 money


glitch.
 They're
 going to
 be
 folding


laundry,
 and
 that's
 fine.
 Like,
 that


that's
 awesome,
 you
 know,


but
 that
 these
 are
 just
 my
 beliefs.
 Just


my
 beliefs.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 Elon
 also
 said
 Optimus


production
 will
 start
 in
 2026.
 So,
 the


fact
 that
 production
 is
 starting
 then


becomes
 the
 question
 of
 can
 they


actually
 sell
 it
 in
 27?
 and
 the
 the
 AI


has
 to
 be
 good
 enough
 for
 it
 to
 be


commercially
 viable
 in
 in
 a
 year
 and
 a


half,
 which
 maybe
 it
 is,
 maybe
 it's
 not.


I
 mean,
 we
 got
 to
 see
 how
 fast
 they


move,
 but
 if
 it's
 not,
 then
 it
 just


might
 be
 a
 2030
 story
 versus
 27,
 which


is
 not
 the
 worst
 thing
 either.


>> Um,


>> I'm
 I'm
 a
 huge
 believer
 of
 Elon.
 Ju
 just


last
 comment
 real
 quick.


>> The
 the
 other
 comments
 of
 this
 chip
 that


they're
 developing
 with
 Samsung
 that's


going
 to
 be
 10x
 better
 than
 their


competitors.


>> Come
 on,
 man.


>> I
 was
 confus
 What
 was
 your
 take
 on
 that?


Cuz
 he
 was
 like,
 "We're
 not
 trying
 to


replace
 Nvidia,
 but
 we
 need
 a
 custom


ASIC
 that's
 better
 than
 Nvidia."
 And
 I


was
 just
 like
 I
 wasn't
 really
 following


why
 exactly
 he
 said
 that.


I
 think
 every
 company
 at
 at
 at
 Tesla


scale
 should
 try
 to
 create
 some
 version


of
 a
 custom
 ASIC.
 I
 think
 they're
 all


trying
 to
 do
 this.
 Okay.
 Reducing


reliance
 on
 Nvidia
 is
 very
 important.
 Uh


well
 well
 at least
 that's
 the
 the
 goal


is
 very
 important.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


going
 to
 happen.
 But
 the
 idea
 that
 he


goes,
 "Hey,
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 replace


Nvidia,
 but
 we're
 also
 going
 to
 have
 a


chip
 on
 a
 performance
 per
 watt
 basis


that's
 10x
 more
 powerful."
 Why
 would
 you


ever
 call
 up
 Nvidia
 then?
 You
 know,
 it


it's
 just


I
 think
 the
 claims
 now
 I
 I'm
 just
 kind


of
 over
 them.
 I
 I
 just
 find
 it's
 all
 a


little
 exaggeratory.
 The
 stock
 is
 not


lining
 up
 to
 the
 claims.
 It
 hasn't
 for


years.
 Uh


yeah,
 I
 don't
 know.
 And
 I
 don't
 think


the
 stock
 cares
 either
 because
 we
 we
 end


up
 seeing
 the
 stock
 down
 4%
 while
 he's


talking
 about
 this
 chip
 beating
 out


Nvidia.
 No
 one's
 believing
 him.
 The


stock
 crashed
 on
 those
 comments
 live
 in


real
 time.


like


so
 he
 has
 a
 core
 core
 audience,
 but


trying
 to
 get
 new
 investors
 in
 to
 buy
 in


at
 this
 price
 is
 going
 to
 be
 hard.
 And


um


hey,
 if
 you
 can
 get
 to
 8.5
 trillion,


it's
 still
 worth
 a
 pretty
 good
 bid
 here.


But
 I
 think
 there's
 other
 investments


that
 are
 much
 cheaper,


very
 easy
 to
 buy
 at
 other
 things
 at
 at


other
 companies
 with
 also
 very
 good


products
 that
 they're
 creating.


Uh
 Tanner,
 last
 question
 for
 you
 guys.


This
 is
 Tanner's
 Twitter,
 so
 please
 make


sure
 to
 subscribe
 and
 follow
 him
 there.


Uh
 so
 I'm
 in
 Sofi
 now.
 2685
 I'm
 in.


>> Are
 we
 going
 to
 the
 moon
 next
 week?


>> Um


>> just
 be
 careful
 with
 how
 you
 say
 it


because
 YouTube
 might
 ban
 the
 video.
 So


you
 have
 to


>> choose
 your
 words
 without
 you.


>> Everything
 I'm
 seeing,
 I'm
 super


excited.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be


SoFi's
 best
 quarter
 by
 far.


Um,
 I
 think
 the
 growth
 rates
 and
 the


margins
 that
 they're
 about
 to
 put
 up
 is


going
 to
 scare
 the
 shorts.
 Like
 just


Wall
 Street's
 not
 even
 remotely
 close
 on


their
 estimates
 going
 into
 earnings
 of


what
 I'm
 expecting.
 Not
 even
 remotely


close.


>> And
 we're
 seeing
 it
 from,
 you
 know,
 app


downloads,
 website
 traffic,
 lending


club,
 every
 large
 bank,
 credit
 cards,


uh,
 brokerages.
 So
 does
 it
 all.
 And
 none


of
 it
 is
 looking
 weak
 in
 financials


right
 now.
 None
 of
 it.


Lending
 Club
 just
 put
 up
 huge
 growth.


And
 to
 try
 to
 compare
 Lending
 Club
 to


SoFi
 is
 like


I
 I I
 can't
 even
 make
 a
 comparison.


They're
 not
 even
 remotely
 comparable


anymore.
 But
 it
 still
 does
 show
 you
 that


the
 demand,
 especially
 from
 insurance


companies,
 from
 banks,
 from
 all
 the
 loan


purchasers
 that
 that
 Lending
 Club
 has,


which
 is
 very
 similar
 to
 the
 same


customers
 that
 buy
 Sofi's
 loans,
 that


they
 are
 going
 to


explode
 in
 loan
 originations.
 I
 cannot


wait.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 fun
 Tuesday.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 I
 mean,
 Lending
 Club's


earnings
 to
 me
 was
 also
 a
 signal
 that


they're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 pretty
 damn
 good


quarter.
 So,


who
 knows,
 man.
 It's
 a
 high
 short.
 I


mean,
 it's
 not
 a
 super
 high
 short
 flow,


but
 still
 eight
 to
 10%
 of
 the
 shorts


piling
 in.
 It
 could
 be.
 And
 then
 you
 get


the
 rate
 cut
 a
 day
 after.


>> So,
 you
 could
 definitely
 see
 some


progress
 there
 for.


>> Yeah,
 it
 it's
 uh
 we'll
 see.
 We'll
 see.


Anyway,
 man,
 thanks
 uh
 thanks
 for
 taking


my
 call.
 I
 just
 thought
 this
 uh
 Shopify


thing
 needs
 to
 be
 known.


>> Yeah,
 appreciate
 it,
 Tanner.
 Talk
 to
 you


later.


>> Yeah,
 later.


All
 right,
 Tanner's
 excited.
 He's


excited
 for
 SoFi.


Not
 the
 most
 excited
 for
 Tessy,
 but


Tessy
 right
 here,
 425.


Still
 trying
 to
 go
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 You


got
 pretty
 much
 everything
 going
 green


except
 Tessy.
 Nvidia
 high
 of
 day
 as


well,
 182.
 And
 you
 got
 the
 S&P
 chilling


out
 at
 that
 670
 level
 as
 well.


All
 right,
 folks.
 I
 think
 that
 is
 pretty


much
 it
 for
 the
 day.
 Um,
 we'll
 be
 back


on
 the
 close.
 I
 think
 we'll
 have
 Chris


on
 today
 for
 the
 macro
 Thursday.
 What
 is


the
 earnings
 picture
 for
 today?
 Oh,
 wow.


We
 actually
 have
 some
 big
 earnings.
 We


have
 Intel.
 That's
 a
 big
 one.
 We
 have


Ford.


Uh,
 we
 have
 Deckers.


We
 have
 a
 couple
 other
 companies.
 Fix,


but
 Intel
 and
 Ford
 are
 the
 big
 ones.


Intel
 and
 Ford
 are
 the
 big ones.
 Yes,


we'll
 have
 a
 daily
 recap
 today.


Yesterday
 we
 missed
 it
 because
 we
 went


super
 long
 with
 the
 Tesla
 recap
 or
 the


Tesla
 earnings,
 but
 we
 will
 have
 a


normal
 daily
 recap
 today
 and
 um
 then


we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.
 Joanie,


thank
 you
 for
 becoming
 a
 channel
 member.


Appreciate
 it.
 Terren,
 thank
 you
 for


becoming
 a
 channel
 member.
 And
 Axiom,


thank
 you
 as
 well
 for
 becoming
 a
 channel


member.
 Deeply
 appreciate
 it.
 Thank
 you


for
 being
 part
 of
 the
 show.
 What
 do
 we


have
 with
 word
 of
 the
 day?


Let's
 see
 what
 we've
 got
 going
 on.


Um,


oh
 wow,
 they
 didn't
 update
 it
 today.


Look
 at
 that.


We
 don't
 have
 a
 Thursday
 word
 of
 the


day.
 They
 have
 the
 same
 one
 from


yesterday,


Wednesday.
 Okay,
 we're
 have
 to
 use
 a


different
 website
 then
 today.


Dictionary.com
 is
 slacking,
 bro.
 Uh,


carp's
 going to
 be
 on
 at
 3
 p.m.
 3
 p.m.


So,
 I'll
 get
 the
 clip
 of
 that
 and
 I'll


probably
 post
 it
 on
 Twitter
 as
 soon
 as


it
 comes
 out,
 but
 3M
 Eastern
 and
 we'll


watch
 it
 on
 the
 market
 close
 when
 we
 get


into


the
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.


Um,


we
 need
 a
 fun
 word
 of
 the
 day
 website,


bro.
 We
 need
 a
 word
 of
 the
 day
 that's


like
 weird.


We
 need
 like
 a
 really
 fun
 website
 for


this.


All
 right,
 the
 only
 one
 I
 got
 is
 from


Britannica.
 Word
 of
 the
 day
 is


fluctuate.


Yeah,
 I
 think
 pretty
 much
 all
 of
 us
 know


this.
 To
 change
 the
 lever,
 strength
 or


value
 frequently.


Well,
 I
 mean,
 you
 had
 stocks
 fluctuate


aggressively
 to
 the
 downside
 last
 week


and
 they're
 starting
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit


more
 of
 their
 momentum
 back.
 S&P
 500


right
 here
 just
 below
 670.
 Ask
 chat
 GBT.


You
 know
 that
 is
 a
 good
 idea.
 Why


haven't
 we
 asked
 chat
 GBT?
 Hold
 on.


That
 actually


see
 this
 is
 why
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 replace


everything
 bro
 like
 look
 all
 these


websites
 now.
 Why
 do
 I
 need
 to
 go
 to


these
 websites
 if
 we
 do
 chat?
 Okay.


Okay.
 So,
 what
 if
 we
 say,
 "Can
 you
 give


me
 a
 word
 of
 the
 day
 that
 is


uh
 very


what's
 the
 adjective?
 That
 is
 very


Can
 you
 give
 me
 a
 word
 of
 the
 day
 that


is
 cool
 to
 use
 in
 my
 daytoday


life?"
 and
 give
 me
 the
 definition
 and


sentence


example.


That's
 a
 boring
 word.
 Serendipity.


Okay.
 No,
 make
 the
 words


not
 common.
 They
 have
 to
 be
 like
 really


different
 from
 regular
 words.


Oh,
 uncommon,
 I
 should
 say.


Perfect.
 You
 want
 rare,
 striking
 words


that
 make
 people
 pause
 for
 a
 second
 but


still
 fit
 naturally
 in
 conversation.


Yes.
 Word
 of
 the
 day.


How
 do
 you
 say
 this
 [ __ ]
 bro?


Paragonate.


After
 quitting
 his
 job,
 he
 decided
 to


paragrenate
 across
 Europe.


Can
 you


say
 the
 words
 for
 me
 so
 I
 know
 what
 they


sound
 like?


Like
 really
 different.
 You're
 going
 to


make
 AI
 talk
 that
 way.
 Exactly.
 Yes.


See,
 this
 is
 what
 I
 need.
 Look
 at
 that.


Look
 at
 that
 phonetic
 breakdown.
 This
 is


what
 I
 need
 in
 my
 life.
 Paragrinate.


Paragrinate.
 Paragrinate.
 Paragrinate.


Boom.
 What
 does
 this
 word
 say?
 To
 travel


or
 wander
 from
 place
 to
 place.


See,
 have
 people
 heard
 this
 word
 before?


There
 you
 go.


>> Paragrenate.


>> I
 think
 we
 use
 Chat
 GBT
 every
 day,


folks.
 I
 think
 we
 use
 Chat
 GBT.
 Like,


we're
 going
 to
 get
 way
 cooler
 words
 than


these
 random
 websites
 putting
 out
 words


of
 the
 days.


There
 you
 go.


That's
 what
 we
 got.
 All right.
 This
 is


what
 we're
 going
 to
 use.
 This
 was
 the


word
 of
 the
 day.
 To
 travel
 or
 wander


around.


That's
 what
 we
 got.
 We
 just
 wasted
 so


much
 energy
 on
 this.
 We
 definitely


wasted
 so
 much
 energy
 on
 this.


You
 can
 set
 up
 auto
 tasks
 and
 run
 this


once
 per
 day.


Okay.
 I
 didn't
 know
 ChatBT
 could
 do


that.
 All right.
 We're
 gonna
 Yeah,
 I'm


going
 to
 turn
 this
 into
 an
 auto
 test


then.
 All right.
 So,
 every
 day
 this
 is


just
 going
 to
 give
 us
 a
 word
 of
 the
 day.


Every
 day.
 Boom.
 That's
 what
 we
 got.


And
 then
 we
 can
 change
 the
 prompt
 some


days
 and
 be
 like,
 give
 us
 certain
 words


for
 different
 types
 of
 uh
 different


types
 of
 things
 that
 are
 going
 on.


All
 right,
 that's
 what
 you
 got.
 Cool.


I'll
 be
 back
 on
 the
 market
 close.
 Uh


Karp
 will
 be
 live
 at
 3M.
 We'll
 get
 that


clip.
 I
 think
 Chris
 will
 be
 on
 today.
 Uh


we
 got
 Intel
 Ford
 earnings
 and
 then


we'll
 see
 if
 we
 can
 kind
 of
 close
 out


the
 end
 of
 the
 week
 to
 be
 as
 strong
 as


we
 were
 closing
 out
 for
 last
 week
 as


well.


All
 right,
 there
 you
 go.
 Thank
 you


everybody.
 Appreciate
 it.
 I'll
 see
 you


guys
 on
 the
 market
 close.
 Bye
 everybody.


Have
 a
 good
 one.
