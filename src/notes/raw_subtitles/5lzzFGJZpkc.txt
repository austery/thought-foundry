From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm

 Mumford.
 Today's


Tuesday,
 October
 28th.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


Hurricane
 Melissa
 is
 on
 track
 to
 hit


Jamaica
 this
 morning
 with
 the
 potential


for
 catastrophic
 damage.


It's
 the
 strongest
 storm
 in
 the
 Atlantic


Ocean
 this
 year,
 and
 the
 National


Hurricane
 Center
 is
 warning
 that
 its


winds
 of
 up
 to
 175
 mph
 could
 cause
 quote


total
 structural
 failure
 and
 cut
 off


power
 and
 communications.
 Forecasters


are
 also
 predicting
 rain
 measured
 not
 in


inches,
 but
 in
 feet,
 up
 to
 3
 ft
 of
 it
 in


some
 places.
 Across
 the
 island,


officials
 are
 concerned
 that
 not
 enough


people
 have
 followed
 evacuation
 orders.


As
 of
 last
 night,
 only
 1,700
 people
 had


gone
 to
 shelters.


>> I
 was
 hoping
 to
 get
 some
 bread,
 but
 the


shelves
 are
 empty.


>> Many
 residents
 were
 scrambling
 to
 gather


supplies
 and
 board
 up
 their
 homes
 and


storefronts


along
 the
 coast,
 where
 resorts
 line
 the


shore.
 The
 Times
 spoke
 with
 some


tourists
 who
 didn't
 make
 it
 off
 the


island
 before
 airports
 closed.


>> The
 wind,
 if
 you
 look
 on
 the
 top,
 you


can
 see
 it
 blowing.
 People
 have
 shut


themselves
 into
 their
 hotel
 rooms
 and


upended
 the
 beds
 to
 barricade
 the


windows
 and
 protect
 themselves
 from


shattering
 glass.
 In
 just
 the
 last
 few


days,
 Hurricane
 Melissa
 grew
 rapidly


into
 a
 category
 5
 storm.
 And
 experts
 say


the
 high
 temperature
 of
 the
 Caribbean


Sea,
 which
 is
 warmer
 than
 usual
 right


now,
 is
 one
 of
 the
 factors
 driving
 the


storm's
 intensity.
 The
 storm
 is
 also


moving
 slowly.
 An
 expert
 in
 atmospheric


science
 told
 the
 Times,
 "Tropical
 storms


typically
 move
 across
 the
 Caribbean
 at


an
 average
 speed
 of
 10
 to
 12
 mph.
 But
 in


recent
 days,
 Melissa
 nearly
 ground
 to
 a


halt,
 at
 one
 point,
 dropping
 to
 just
 1


mph.
 At
 its
 current
 pace,
 it
 will
 likely


linger
 over
 Jamaica
 for
 much
 of
 today,


bringing
 more
 rain
 and
 higher
 winds
 for


longer
 with
 the
 potential
 for
 more


damage.
 After
 crossing
 Jamaica,
 it's


expected
 to
 hit
 Cuba.

Yesterday,
 while
 continuing
 his
 tour
 of


Asia,
 President
 Trump
 returned
 to
 an


idea
 that
 he's
 floated
 before
 of
 running


for
 a
 third
 term
 in
 office.


>> I
 would
 I
 would
 I
 would
 love
 to
 do
 it.
 I


have
 my
 best
 numbers
 ever.
 It's
 very


terrible.
 I
 have
 my
 best
 numbers.


>> Speaking
 with
 reporters
 on
 Air
 Force


One,
 Trump
 said
 he
 would
 love
 to
 run


again.
 Am
 I
 not
 ruling
 it
 out?
 You'll


have
 to
 tell
 me.
 All
 I
 can
 tell


>> that
 would
 be
 a
 blatant
 violation
 of
 the


Constitution.
 The
 22nd
 Amendment
 bars


anyone
 from
 being
 elected
 president
 more


than
 twice.
 But
 Trump
 and
 some
 of
 his


allies
 have
 repeatedly
 mused
 about
 it.


This
 spring,
 he
 said
 he
 was
 quote
 not


joking
 about
 the
 idea.
 He's
 shown
 off


hats
 that
 say
 Trump
 2028.
 And
 in
 the


past
 week,
 his
 former
 chief
 strategist


Steve
 Bannon
 doubled
 down
 on
 it.


>> Well,
 he's
 going
 to
 get
 a
 third
 term.
 So


Trump
 28,
 Trump
 is
 going
 to
 be
 president


28
 and
 people
 just
 ought
 to
 get


accommodated
 with
 that.


>> Speaking
 on
 a
 podcast
 from
 the


Economist,
 Bannon
 suggested
 that
 he's


working
 with
 others
 on
 a
 plan
 to


circumvent
 the
 22nd
 amendment.


>> There's
 many
 different
 alternatives.
 At


the
 appropriate
 time,
 we'll
 lay
 out
 what


the
 plan
 is,
 but
 there's
 a
 plan
 and


President
 Trump
 will
 be
 the
 president
 in


28.


>> In
 private,
 Trump
 has
 told
 advisers
 that


the
 third
 term
 idea
 is
 a
 strategy
 to


grab
 attention
 and
 aggravate
 his


critics.
 According
 to
 people
 familiar


with
 his
 comments,


in
 a
 remarkable
 shift
 yesterday,
 the


largest
 union
 representing
 federal


workers
 broke
 from
 Democrats
 and
 urged


all
 lawmakers
 to
 pass
 a
 spending
 bill
 to


reopen
 the
 government
 as
 soon
 as


possible.
 All
 year,
 the
 union
 had
 worked


to
 oppose
 Republican
 policies,


particularly
 President
 Trump's
 efforts


to
 slash
 the
 federal
 workforce.
 And


before
 the
 shutdown,
 the
 union's


leadership
 had
 called
 on
 Republicans
 to


negotiate
 with
 Democrats
 over
 their
 push


to
 extend
 health
 care
 subsidies
 for
 over


20
 million
 Americans.
 But
 as
 the


shutdown
 nears
 the
 one-mon
 mark
 and


hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 federal
 workers


go
 unpaid,
 the
 president
 of
 the
 union


now
 says
 the
 priority
 is
 getting
 the


government
 reopened
 and
 that
 policy


debates
 in
 Congress
 should
 happen
 quote


without
 punishing
 the
 people
 who
 keep


our
 nation
 running.
 Meanwhile,


>> so
 reminder
 for
 my
 Republican


colleagues,
 the
 majority
 of
 people
 who


rely
 on
 the
 premium
 tax
 credits
 are
 in


red
 states.


>> Democratic
 lawmakers
 are
 underscoring


the
 stakes
 of
 the
 healthc
 care
 subsidy


issue
 at
 the
 center
 of
 the
 shutdown


debate
 as
 the
 deadlock
 on
 Capitol
 Hill


continues.


>> These
 are
 your
 voters
 and
 you
 are
 not


listening
 to
 them.
 Instead,
 what
 is
 the


Republican
 solution?
 Wait.
 The
 subsidies


lower
 the
 cost
 of
 health
 insurance
 that


people
 can
 get
 through
 marketplaces
 set


up
 by
 Obamacare.
 And
 nearly
 60%
 of


people
 with
 that
 type
 of
 insurance
 live


in
 Republican
 congressional
 districts.


If
 Congress
 doesn't
 vote
 to
 extend
 the


subsidies,
 which
 run
 out
 at
 the
 end
 of


this
 year,
 the
 state
 that
 will
 see
 the


biggest
 impact
 is
 Florida,
 where
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 low-wage
 service
 workers


who
 don't
 get
 healthare
 through
 work
 and


a
 lot
 of
 early
 retirees
 who
 aren't


eligible
 yet
 for
 Medicare.
 For
 example,


someone
 in
 their
 early
 60s
 in
 the
 state


who
 earns
 about
 $65,000
 a
 year
 could
 see


their
 premiums
 jump
 from
 a
 few
 hundred
 a


month
 to
 $1,000
 or
 more.
 And
 according


to
 some
 estimates,
 about
 1.5
 million


people
 in
 Florida
 could
 drop
 their
 plans


because
 of
 the
 soaring
 costs.


A
 UN
 Human
 Rights
 Commission
 has


concluded
 that
 Russia's
 been
 carrying


out
 war
 crimes
 and
 crimes
 against


humanity
 in
 southern
 Ukraine
 by


intentionally
 targeting
 and
 killing


civilians
 with
 drones.
 For
 more
 than
 a


year
 in
 the
 city
 of
 Heronne,
 Russian


operators
 have
 used
 drones
 to
 drop
 hand


grenades
 on
 civilians
 when
 they're
 out


on
 the
 sidewalk
 or
 working
 in
 their


backyard
 gardens.
 It's
 happened
 so
 often


the
 city
 has
 set
 up
 miles
 of
 netting


over
 its
 streets
 to
 try
 and
 block
 the


drones.
 Some
 of
 the
 attacks
 have
 hit


ambulances
 or
 the
 drones
 have
 hovered


over
 burning
 buildings
 waiting
 to
 drop


grenades
 on
 firefighters
 as
 they
 arrive.


Russia
 has
 denied
 targeting
 civilians,


but
 Russian
 military
 units
 often
 post


videos
 of
 the
 attacks
 online
 with


footage
 captured
 from
 the
 drone's
 eye


view.
 UN
 investigators
 looked
 at
 more


than
 500
 videos
 of
 the
 strikes.
 The


report
 concluded
 that
 because
 the
 drones


were
 equipped
 with
 live
 streaming


cameras
 that
 left
 quote
 no
 doubt
 about


the
 knowledge
 and
 intent
 of
 the


perpetrators.


And
 finally


>> 1150
 in
 Los
 Angeles.


Sends

 ball

 field.
 Baro's


going
 back
 before
 the
 catch.


Barry
 Freeman
 has
 ended
 it.
 Game
 three


of
 the
 World
 Series
 dragged
 late
 late


late
 into
 the
 night
 last
 night,
 tying


the
 record
 for
 the
 longest
 game
 in
 World


Series
 history
 at
 18
 innings.
 The


matchup
 between
 the
 Toronto
 Blue
 Jays


and
 the
 LA
 Dodgers
 lasted
 almost
 7


hours.
 An
 exhilarating
 and
 exhausting


night
 for
 fans
 in
 the
 stands
 and
 at


home.
 It
 ended
 finally
 with
 a
 walk-off


home
 run
 that
 gave
 the
 Dodgers
 a
 2-1


lead
 in
 the
 series.
 While
 it
 was


definitely
 a
 hall,
 the
 marathon
 length


game
 is
 still
 short
 of
 the
 MLB
 record


for
 longest
 game
 timewise.
 That
 goes
 to


a
 1984
 game
 between
 the
 Chicago
 White


Socks
 and
 the
 Milwaukee
 Brewers.
 It


stretched
 for
 over
 8
 hours
 and
 had
 to
 be


played
 over
 2
 days.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines
 today
 on
 the


daily.
 A
 lot
 of
 firefighters
 who
 battle


wildfires
 are
 contracted
 through
 private


companies.
 A
 look
 at
 how
 lacks,
 rules,


and
 regulatory
 loopholes
 have
 left
 many


of
 them
 sick
 and
 in
 debt.

 Times

 or

 you
