Good morning everyone.
My name is Gabe.
I'm a traveling car salesman.
So today, I'm here
to sell you the keys to this car,
this beautiful vintage PT Cruiser.
I mean, look at that
faux wood side paneling.
I'm told it's got turbo.
Look. It's a work of art. Trust me.
Now, when I say that I'm selling
the keys to this car,
I really mean it.
I have 5,000 of these keys,
and every single last one of them
works to that car.
You click the key fob once,
it unlocks the door,
you click it twice, it starts the engine.
If you buy any one
of these 5,000 keys from me,
naturally you get access to the car,
but so do 4,999 other people.
Whatever happens beyond that
is not necessarily my problem.
Like I said, I'm just a car salesman.
(Laughter)
So you're probably wondering
at this point, is this real?
Is this guy just making this stuff up?
Well, it is real.
My name is Gabe, and I'm actually
the founder of an art collective
based in New York City, called Mschf.
These are our logos.
Mischief is a bit
of a difficult beast to explain,
and I'm not going
to even try to describe it.
Let me give you a couple examples
to help paint that picture
or confuse you even further.
Handbags. Handbags are really expensive,
and incredibly, the smaller they get,
the more expensive they become.
So a few summers ago,
we actually endeavored
to make the world's smallest handbag,
microscopic, in fact,
and somehow it ended up
selling at auction for 63,000 dollars,
incidentally making it the world's
most expensive handbag per volume.
Here's another one.
This is nothing like a handbag.
Youâ€™ve probably seen
those Boston Dynamics Spot dog robots
that do TikTok dances
with K-pop stars on YouTube.
Well, we managed to get one.
Instead of making it dance,
we strapped a paintball gun to it
and we connected it remotely to a website
where people could take turns
driving it and firing it
at an art gallery that we constructed.
Boston Dynamics
did not like that one very much.
So you've probably figured out by now
that I'm not actually here
to sell you keys to a car.
Today I'm here to talk to you
about bad ideas.
The kind of ideas
that typically die on the vine
because reason or work colleagues
get in the way.
But to me, these are
the most exciting ideas
because you just never know
what might happen.
Take these crazy-looking
shoes, for example.
I think it was like the spring of 2023.
My colleagues and I were sketching out
the initial prototypes
of the Big Red Boot.
I remember us being equal parts terrified
because, of course, like,
who's going to wear these,
much less spend money on them?
But at the same time,
the moment that we put on
the initial prototypes ourselves --
(Laughter)
We were filled with
such a chaotic sense of glee
that we were like,
you know what, we just got to do it.
So we committed to making
a couple hundred pairs,
we priced them at 350 dollars
and we just prayed that
there would be a few hundred people
out there in the world who would spend
money on these crazy-looking things.
So a week before the drop,
we leaked this image
through a friend's Instagram account.
Again, just hoping
that people don't hate it,
or even worse, that they don't ignore it.
In hindsight, we needn't have worried.
The algorithm smiled quite fondly
upon the Big Red Boot,
and all of a sudden
this thing was everywhere.
Like, I don't even, I can't even.
It's basically like a blur.
I don't understand what happened.
All of a sudden, people were wearing them
courtside at NBA games.
I saw Lil Wayne
wearing them in a music video.
I remember my dad calling me
and saying, "Hey, Gabe,
there's a professional WWE wrestler
wearing your boots
on live pay-per-view TV.
And he just curb stomped another guy."
It's incredible.
And yet we almost didn't do it.
This is almost where it ended.
Just as an internal project
on the cutting room floor.
People told us it was not
a great business decision.
And honestly, I get it.
But what started as a bad idea
ended up becoming a very interesting idea.
Here's another one.
The idea was an ATM machine.
Totally normal, functional,
operational, extremely legal ATM machine,
with one catch.
Attached to the ATM machine, as you see,
is a digital leaderboard that ranks people
based on the amount of money
in their remaining account balances.
(Laughter)
I'm glad you guys think it's funny.
I thought it was horrifying.
So it wasn't enough
for us to just make this.
We had to put it in the right place.
Does it go outside our studio in Brooklyn?
Do we put it in Times Square?
My colleagues and I
conferred for a little bit,
and we realized there's only one place
that this thing can ever go.
It's Art Basel Miami.
So we take it to Miami.
Somehow, we get our way
into a gallery and we get into a booth.
And on day one, people were actually
a little bit hesitant to engage,
which I totally get it.
It's a little bit shady.
It's participatory, I understand.
But eventually people
would muster up the courage
to swipe their card.
They would clock in at like 100 dollars
in their bank account balance,
maybe 1,200 dollars
in their bank account balance.
By the end of the day, however,
someone ended up swiping
and clocked in at 12,000 dollars
in their bank account balance.
And then things started to get
a little bit weird.
The next day, a famous celebrity DJ
named Diplo showed up
with his entire entourage,
pulled out his debit card,
swiped it in the machine,
clocked in at three million dollars
in his bank account,
and shot to the top of the leaderboard.
And honestly, the rest is kind of hazy
because a crowd amassed so huge
around the ATM machine
for the following three days
that the art fair actually assigned
five extra security guards
not to protect the ATM machine,
but to keep the crowd
from bumping into the artworks
of the neighboring galleries,
which was actually very funny.
But the most interesting thing
that I got to observe here
was this unexpected crowd dynamic
where when people
with astonishingly low bank accounts
would swipe their cards,
in front of this
captive audience, by the way --
and I'm talking really low,
like two dollars, concerningly low --
(Laughter)
They would swipe,
they would get ranked at the bottom,
and then they would turn around
to face the audience,
and the audience would lose their minds --
they were cheering
and screaming and celebrating
and clapping and taking pictures.
And it was sincere.
It was actually like this wholesome
"one of us"-like celebration,
which was not anything that we expected.
And then to sort of wrap up that week,
the funny thing is, a buyer ended up
acquiring the ATM machine
as a sculpture
for a whopping 75,000 dollars.
But the funny thing to me is,
I don't think that person ever realized
that the artwork was not the ATM machine.
The artwork was the act of people
engaging with the ATM machine.
The actual artwork was
the relationships that people developed
with one another via the ATM machine.
See, when we made this thing originally,
we were pretty sure
it was going to reflect
all the worst parts of humanity
at Art Basel Miami.
But we were wrong.
It ended up just being
a random crowd of total strangers
having a great time together
in one big awkward, shared moment
of financial transparency.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Oh, I'm not done yet.
I'm not done yet.
So when you open
Pandora's box of bad ideas,
clearly the sky's the limit.
So let's keep pushing it.
I got three minutes.
This is a big fruit loop.
I don't --
there's not much else to say.
It's real. It's about the size
of a dinner plate.
It takes a lot of milk to put down,
but I assure you,
it's just as good as the original.
(Laughter)
This is what we call an Alexagate.
It's an electronics device
armed with seven
ultrasonic speakers at its base
that blasts white noise
into the mic of any Alexa device
to keep it from eavesdropping on you
when you're not using it.
(Applause)
And then this one is a life-size sculpture
that keeps track of and counts
the number of times anyone has touched it.
Because if you ever go
to a gallery or museum,
you know you're not supposed
to touch the art.
So this is supposed
to discourage people touching the art.
Right. Actually, I wanted to wrap up
the story about the car
because it is real.
If you take a second later,
it's parked outside.
It's here on the loop, so go find it.
The car was real. 
The 5,000 keys were real.
We released this to the world
in the fall of 2022,
and for the following nine months,
we actually got to watch this thing
change hands hundreds,
if not thousands of times,
mostly via very peaceful communal meetups
and the occasional Grand Theft Auto,
which I can't really
talk too much about here.
Over that nine months,
it started in New York,
it made its way down to Philadelphia,
it stayed in Philadelphia for a few days.
Grand Theft Auto.
And then eventually made its way
across the Midwest to the West Coast,
where nine months later,
I mean, the GPS stopped.
We kind of assumed
that the project was over.
Which is OK. It had a glorious life.
But then one day I get a call,
and it's a call from a tow pound.
And the tow pound is saying, "Hey,
we're pretty sure that we have your car
because it is registered under your name.
But it's such a weird thing
because people keep showing up
and claiming the car,
and they all have keys that work."
(Laughter)
So we ended up taking the car back,
it was no longer functional,
and we decided to place it
in an art gallery in Los Angeles.
And at this gallery, actually,
I got to attend the opening,
and at the opening I observed something
that I totally did not expect to see,
which was purchasers of the key
had flown in from all over the country,
not just to see the thing
that they had touched and interacted with
show up in a gallery,
but they were actually there
to meet each other for the first time.
I watched them taking photos
and sharing stories of their own
individual escapades with the car,
and I took a step back and realized
this project was never about the car.
It was never about the keys.
It was about the people.
Like, it really was about
the friends you make along the way.
And now if you see the car,
you'll see it outside,
I mean, it looks nothing
like it did when we started out.
The faux wood paneling
is gone, regrettably,
but now it's covered in paint,
drawings, scribbled messages
from complete strangers
to other total strangers.
It's no longer a car.
Now it's a rallying point
for this weird little random community
that sprang up out of nowhere
and gave this thing a life of its own.
And with that,
I'd like to invite
each and every one of you
to reach under your seat.
Because I've placed --
(Laughs)
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
(Laughter)
They told me not to do that.
I did it anyways.
This is my first and last TED Talk.
Whatever.
Anyways, we all know that keys,
they start cars
just like ATM machines
are supposed to dispense cash.
Just like Big Red Boots
are supposed to be shoes.
But in the case of the bad idea,
none of these ended up being
what they appeared to be on the surface.
They ended up taking a life of their own,
and they all became
something else entirely,
for better or for worse.
And to me, that's the most
exciting thing about it all.
I'm not necessarily saying
that bad ideas are good ideas.
All I'm saying is give yourself a chance
to explore the thing
that makes you uncomfortable,
because you just never know
what might happen.
All right. Thank you.
(Applause and cheers)
