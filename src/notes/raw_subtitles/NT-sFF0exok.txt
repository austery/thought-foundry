All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 close.


I'm
 sorry
 I'm
 late.
 Literally
 before


going
 live,
 the
 camera
 was
 being
 stupid.


I
 know
 that's
 a
 dog
 ate
 my
 homework


excuse,
 but
 like
 three,
 four
 times
 this


week,
 the
 camera's
 been
 done.
 But
 we
 are


back.
 We
 are
 live.
 Uh
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 of


stuff
 to
 talk
 about,
 folks.
 We
 got
 the


S&P
 500
 that's
 trying
 to
 get
 to
 alltime


highs
 on
 the
 close,
 which
 is
 well,
 I


mean,
 we
 are
 basically
 back
 to
 where
 we


were
 from
 two
 weeks
 ago,
 which
 is
 nice


to
 see.
 67194
 right
 here
 on
 the
 S&P
 500.


And
 you've
 got
 a
 rebound,
 not
 just
 on


the
 S&P,
 but
 Tessy
 trying
 to
 go
 for
 448.


The
 stock
 was
 at
 418
 this
 morning.


Palanteer
 up
 3%
 right
 now.
 We
 got
 the


Karp
 interview
 on
 Fox
 News
 that
 we'll


take
 a
 look
 at.
 Robin
 Hood
 13487.
 Big


big
 day
 for
 Robin
 Hood.
 You
 got
 the
 S&P


500
 again
 up
 6%
 on
 the
 day.
 SoFi's
 up


4%.
 Grab
 got
 to
 570.
 Google's
 up
 half
 a


percent.
 AMD
 up
 1.6.
 Even
 Amazon


breaking
 220
 on
 the
 day
 at
 221.
 Meta


back
 at
 735.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 been
 a
 pretty


incredible
 day.
 SMCI
 a
 little
 bit
 more


of
 an
 ugly
 day
 down
 about
 9%.
 Uh,
 and


even
 Bitcoin
 not
 doing
 too
 bad.
 Bitcoin


was
 at
 106
 this
 morning.
 now
 back
 at


110.
 So
 you've
 seen
 a
 obvious
 rebound


across
 the
 entire
 market.
 Coreweave
 up


2%,
 Rocket
 Lab
 up
 5%,
 AS


flat
 on
 the
 day,
 but
 not
 as
 bad
 as
 it


was
 a
 couple
 of
 days
 ago.
 Uh
 obviously


you've
 got
 all
 the
 other
 names
 in
 terms


of
 high
 quality
 growth
 like
 a
 crowd


strike
 519
 that's
 up
 4%
 of the
 day.


Coinbase
 is
 up
 1.4%.
 So
 the
 reason
 is


why
 is
 this
 happening?
 The
 reason
 is
 why


is
 this
 happening?
 And
 we
 actually
 have


a
 bunch
 of
 different
 headlines
 to
 talk


about
 uh
 for
 why
 this
 is
 happening


across
 the
 entire
 board.
 I
 think
 the


number
 one
 reason
 is
 the
 sellers
 and
 the


shorts
 probably
 got
 a
 bit
 exhausted.
 It


has
 been
 a
 rough
 two
 weeks
 of
 selling


across
 the
 board.
 Definitely
 for
 high


driven
 momentum
 stocks
 also
 just
 random


names
 like
 uh
 your
 average
 Meta,
 Apple,


Google,
 right?
 All
 the
 big
 tech
 names


that
 got
 hit
 and
 you're
 starting
 to
 see


a
 little
 bit
 of
 rebound.
 Number
 two
 is


Trump
 is
 saying
 a
 bunch
 of
 stuff
 that


seems
 relatively
 bullish.
 So
 the
 first


thing
 he
 said
 about
 an
 hour
 ago
 was
 that


he
 confirmed
 the
 October
 30th
 meeting
 in


person
 with
 President
 Xi.
 October
 30th


meeting
 with
 President
 Xi.
 As
 a
 result


of
 that
 meeting
 officially
 being


confirmed,
 that
 is
 why
 you're
 also


seeing
 some
 more
 momentum.
 Uh
 the
 market


as
 soon
 as
 he
 announced
 that
 started
 to


really
 like
 it
 and
 you
 would
 imagine
 the


market
 would
 like
 that
 because
 you
 know


the
 market
 enjoys
 that
 uh
 the


negotiations
 are
 going
 well.
 So
 that
 was


the
 first
 thing.
 Trump's
 live
 right
 now.


He's
 saying
 a
 bunch
 of
 things.
 We'll
 try


to
 get
 a
 bunch
 of
 those
 quotes.
 One
 of


the
 quotes
 he
 just
 said
 was
 he
 got
 a


call
 from
 Nvidia's
 Jensen
 Hang
 about
 San


Francisco.
 I'll
 get
 some
 more
 context
 on


those
 quotes
 in
 a
 second,
 but
 he
 is
 he


is
 saying
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 right
 now.


One
 of
 the
 number
 one
 things
 is
 that
 the


China
 meetings
 are
 set
 to
 go
 for
 October


30th,
 which
 is
 a
 day
 after
 the
 FOMC


meeting
 and
 a
 day
 before
 uh
 he
 continues


to
 have
 meetings
 with
 other
 officials


across
 the
 world,
 potentially
 even
 Kim


Jong-un.
 So
 that
 meeting
 is
 going
 to
 be


very
 timely
 next
 week
 and
 very
 important


in
 terms
 of
 seeing
 what
 that
 could


actually
 do.
 Uh,
 so
 that's
 why
 we
 have
 I


think
 the
 market's
 getting
 some
 good


momentum
 and
 that's
 going
 across
 the


entire
 board.
 Your
 Oaklows
 that
 is
 up
 4%


on
 the
 day.
 So
 down
 30%
 for
 the
 week,
 up


4%
 right
 here.
 Quantum
 names
 have
 had
 a


pretty
 interesting
 morning.
 So
 again,


these
 guys
 were
 up
 a
 lot
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 They're
 not
 up
 as
 much.
 DW


was
 up
 20%,
 now
 it's
 up
 13%.
 There
 was
 a


report
 that
 came
 out
 by
 Yahoo
 Finance


that
 said
 the
 United
 States
 government


did
 not
 have
 conversations
 with
 these


quantum
 companies.
 Um,
 and
 so
 that


that's
 when
 they
 started
 falling.
 Then


Regetti
 gave
 a
 quote
 to
 CNBC
 and
 said,


"We
 are
 having
 conversations
 and
 and


they
 added,
 by
 the
 way,
 if
 the
 US


doesn't
 invest
 in
 us,
 then
 someone
 else


will
 and
 the
 US
 is
 going to
 be
 left


behind,
 which
 is
 not
 a
 good
 thing."
 Uh,


and
 then
 you
 had
 Bloomberg
 report
 20


minutes
 ago.
 This
 was
 the
 quote
 by


Regetti
 to
 CNBC.
 Then
 you
 had
 Bloomberg


report
 that
 no,
 no,
 they
 actually
 are


legit
 having
 conversations
 with
 a
 bunch


of
 these
 companies.
 So,
 I
 don't
 think


anyone
 necessarily
 knows
 exactly
 what
 is


happening
 for
 sure,
 but
 the
 market
 is


not
 giving
 them
 the
 massive
 premium
 they


had
 in
 the
 pre-market,
 not
 taking
 away


all
 that
 premium.
 So
 you
 have
 them


relatively
 green
 on
 the
 day
 but
 not
 as


green
 as
 they
 were
 in
 the
 pre-market.
 So


just
 been
 a
 wild
 day
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 uh


overall
 momentum
 plays.
 Rare
 earth


stocks
 those
 are
 slightly
 green
 some
 of


them
 the
 rest
 of
 them
 being
 red
 kind
 of


losing
 their
 momentum.
 And
 then
 you
 have


the
 Bitcoin
 miners
 turn
 data
 centers
 IN


great
 day
 up
 7%.
 IN
 has
 been
 down
 20%


over
 the
 past
 week.
 So
 that's
 not
 too


bad.
 Cipher's
 up
 5%.
 Wolf
 is
 up
 2%.
 Bit


farms
 up
 4%.
 Galaxy
 up
 3%.
 Then
 Riot
 up


7%
 as
 well.
 Um,
 and
 that's
 kind
 of
 what


you
 got
 as
 we
 get
 into
 this
 market


close.
 S&P
 500,
 we
 got
 a
 little bit
 of
 a


red
 candle
 right
 there.
 Trump
 is


speaking,
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 we


get
 any
 quotes
 from
 Trump.
 I
 don't
 think


he's
 taking
 Q&A
 yet.
 As
 soon
 as
 he


starts
 taking
 Q&A,
 you
 know,
 you
 might


have
 him
 say
 something
 that
 could
 piss


off
 the
 market.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see


if
 anything
 happens
 there.
 Oscar's
 down


because
 of
 Molina
 Health.
 Remember,


Molina
 Health
 took
 a
 really
 nasty
 hit.
 I


mean,
 they
 said
 EPS
 would
 be
 19.
 They


came
 in
 at
 14.
 Now,
 Oscar
 is
 recovering


from
 where
 it
 was
 in
 the
 morning.
 It
 was


at
 like
 17
 bucks
 or
 it
 was
 at$1850.
 Now


it's
 at
 1960.
 So
 not
 a
 horrible
 decline,


but
 that
 is
 still
 down
 in
 the
 day.
 And


then
 Nvidia
 right
 here
 182.
 I
 think


Tesla's
 the
 most
 impressed
 of
 the
 day.


Tesla
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 to
 do.
 Tesla
 got


to
 413
 in
 the
 morning.
 Now
 it's
 at
 448.


So
 anyone
 who
 bought
 that
 dip
 has
 been


heavily
 rewarded.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 kind


of
 going
 up
 with
 the
 broader
 market


going
 up,
 which
 is
 also
 nice
 to
 see
 as


well.
 So
 that's
 what
 you
 have
 across
 the


board
 in
 terms
 of
 some
 of
 this
 price


action.
 Now
 what
 do
 we
 have
 after
 the


bell?
 We
 have
 Intel
 and
 Ford.
 Intel
 and


Ford.
 Those
 are
 going
 to
 be
 very,
 very


important
 earnings.
 Let
 me
 know
 in
 the


chat
 if
 anyone
 owns
 those
 names.
 We'll


actually
 do
 a
 poll
 right
 here
 on
 Intel


and
 Ford.
 I
 do
 have
 the
 Karp
 interview.


Uh
 it
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 long
 interview,
 so


I'm
 going
 to
 wait
 until
 after
 the


earnings.
 It's
 about


round
 about
 15
 20
 minutes.
 So,
 let's
 get


through
 the
 earnings
 and
 then
 we
 can
 sit


back
 and
 watch
 the
 whole
 thing.
 It
 is


not
 like
 a
 two
 three
 minute
 interview.


Uh
 typical
 Karp.
 I
 mean,
 nothing
 too


crazy,
 nothing
 too
 different.
 He
 he
 was


asked
 about
 the
 contract
 value
 of
 this


Lumen
 deal
 and
 um
 you
 know
 it's
 reported


by
 Bloomberg
 that
 it
 was
 $200
 million.


He
 did
 not
 confirm
 how
 much
 it
 was
 but


he
 did
 say
 it's
 a
 pretty
 big
 deal
 and
 a


multi-year
 strategic
 partnership
 which


is
 four
 pounders.
 So
 here's
 the
 question


in
 the
 chat.
 Uh
 Intel
 or
 Ford,


which
 one
 outperforms
 after
 the
 bell?


Intel
 or
 Ford?
 If
 you
 had
 to
 buy
 one
 of


these
 for
 an
 earnings
 gamble,
 which
 one


would
 you
 buy?
 And
 what
 do
 you
 think


we're
 going
 to
 see?
 Now,
 the
 street,
 it


doesn't
 have
 the
 highest
 expectations


for
 Intel.
 Uh,
 let
 me
 just
 pull
 up
 the


numbers
 right
 here.
 Ford,
 you
 know,


tends
 to
 be
 not
 as
 volatile.
 Intel,
 I


believe,
 is
 a
 5%
 move
 up
 or
 down
 baked


into
 it.
 Intel
 Street
 wants
 1
 cent
 per


share
 and
 13.14
 billion
 in
 revenue.
 So,


they're
 not
 expecting
 too
 much.
 Anything


above
 that
 would
 be
 good.
 Intel
 again


did
 get
 rid
 of
 their
 dividend
 about
 five


quarters
 ago.
 So,
 question
 is
 just
 going


to
 be
 what
 they
 can
 put
 up
 on
 these


results.
 Intel
 right
 here
 is
 up
 a
 decent


chunk
 year
 to
 date.
 It's
 up
 2%
 on
 the


day.
 So,
 you're
 getting
 a
 pre-
 action


move
 as
 we
 get
 into
 it.
 And
 it's
 up,


yeah,
 87%
 year-to
 date.
 I
 mean,
 they


don't
 really
 have
 room
 to
 mess
 up.
 But


then
 again,
 the
 US
 government
 pumped
 9


billion
 into
 them.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 who


knows?
 Maybe
 this
 gets
 rerated
 into
 the


43s,
 45s


now
 that
 the
 government's
 backing
 them.


If
 they
 can
 put
 up
 any
 level
 of


meaningful
 results,
 that
 would
 get
 the


street
 excited.
 But
 that's
 what
 you
 got


right
 there
 on
 Intel.
 78%
 of
 you
 think


Intel
 outperforms
 Ford.


All
 right.
 Decent
 amount
 of
 people


thinking
 Intel
 will
 outperform.
 Couple


other
 headlines
 we
 got
 five
 minutes


until
 the
 market
 closes.
 First
 of
 all,


money
 market
 funds.
 We
 have
 the
 results.


Uh
 let's
 put
 in
 the
 chat
 before
 I
 say


it.
 Increase
 or
 decrease?
 What
 do
 you


think?
 Last
 week
 we
 had
 a
 decrease
 in


money
 market
 funds
 by
 15
 billion.
 We


have
 the
 updated
 numbers
 here.
 And
 I


will
 uh
 show
 you
 guys
 what
 those
 numbers


are.


And
 let's
 just
 say
 there's
 still
 a
 lot


of
 money
 on
 the
 sidelines.


There
 is
 still
 a
 lot
 of
 freaking
 money


on
 the
 sidelines.


Decrease,
 decrease,
 increase,
 decrease.


The
 answer
 is
 officially
 increased.


Money
 market
 funds
 increase
 by
 30


billion
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right
 there
 to


7.4
 trillion.


7.4
 4
 trillion
 is
 what
 we
 have
 on
 these


money
 market
 funds.
 So
 I
 mean
 look
 it
 it


shows
 that
 people
 still
 want
 a
 return


that
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 you
 know


risking
 any
 and
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that


return
 not
 risking
 anything
 that
 is
 why


you
 have
 these
 money
 market
 funds


getting
 to
 these
 levels
 7.4
 trillion


30.37
 billion
 is
 what
 you
 are


uh
 seeing
 right
 there.
 All right
 so


that's
 what
 we
 have
 on
 money
 markets.


Now,
 the
 other
 couple
 headlines
 that
 we


have
 before
 we
 get
 into
 the
 close.


Amazon
 debuting
 their
 AI
 glasses
 for


drivers
 along
 with
 warehouse
 robots.


Amazon
 unveiled
 on
 Wednesday
 an


ambitious
 suite
 of
 AI
 powered


technologies
 designed
 to
 revolutionize


both
 delivery
 operations
 and
 warehouse


automation,
 including
 smart
 glasses
 for


drivers
 and
 advanced
 robotic
 systems


that
 could
 reshape
 the
 company's


workforce.
 You
 know,
 you
 had
 that
 big


headline
 the
 other
 day
 that
 Amazon
 is


trying
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 600,000
 people
 over


the
 next
 couple
 years.
 Morgan
 Stanley


said
 they
 would
 save
 $4
 billion
 by
 doing


that.
 Um,
 and
 now
 they're
 getting
 into


glasses.
 Meta
 is
 getting
 into
 glasses.


Apple's
 getting
 into
 glasses.
 So,
 I


guess
 Amazon,
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 reasons


why
 Amazon
 is
 just
 such
 such
 a


multifaceted
 business.
 They're
 going
 to


try
 to
 get
 into
 as
 many
 different
 lines


of
 business
 that
 they
 can.
 It
 looks
 like


they
 are
 also
 getting
 into
 glasses.
 On


top
 of
 that,
 Nvidia
 and
 Google
 or
 Nvidia


and
 Uber,
 I
 should
 say,
 announced
 that


they
 are
 working
 together
 to
 advance


autonomous
 vehicle
 development.
 The
 two


are
 using
 Uber's
 large
 realorld
 driving


data
 to
 post
 train
 on
 Nvidia's
 Cosmos


platform.
 Cosmos
 is
 using
 their


synthetic
 data
 in
 combination
 with
 real


world
 data,
 improving
 simulation


accuracy,
 safety,
 and
 performance
 in


complex
 real
 world
 conditions.
 Nvidia


has
 been
 working
 with
 Uber
 and
 a
 lot
 of


these
 other
 uh
 driving
 companies
 for
 a


long
 time
 in
 regards
 to
 trying
 to


eventually
 create
 something
 that
 is


realistic
 for
 self-driving.
 And
 you


know,
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 I
 I
 do


think
 Tesla
 really
 has
 the
 lead
 right


here.
 But
 Nvidia
 is
 working
 with
 Uber


and
 it
 makes
 sense
 for
 them
 to
 work
 with


Uber.
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 182.
 And
 then


you
 got
 Uber
 right
 here
 at
 9455.
 Trump


is
 talking
 about
 China.
 Okay,
 let's
 go


to
 him.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 any


quotes
 right
 here
 on
 China
 as
 we
 get


into
 the
 close.


>> Every
 ounce
 of
 parks
 that
 we
 had


just
 disgusting
 and
 I
 wrote
 around
 so


beautiful
 statuary
 mark
 but
 we
 could
 do


it
 so
 much
 faster.
 I
 told
 him
 there
 I


love
 what
 you're
 doing.
 I


>> No,
 it's
 crime.
 He's
 still
 talking
 about


crime.
 I
 don't
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 get


too
 much
 Q&A
 on
 China
 yet.
 We
 will
 get


it
 eventually,
 but
 they
 are
 still


talking
 about
 crime
 right
 here.


And
 it
 might
 take
 a
 minute
 to
 uh
 to
 get


there.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 this
 in
 a
 second.


Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.
 All


right,
 we
 got
 about
 two
 minutes.
 Again,


we'll
 get
 a
 bunch
 of
 these
 Trump
 quotes


and
 we're
 gonna
 see
 what
 he
 says.
 that


mic
 thing
 that
 was
 just
 on
 Fox
 News


right
 there.


And
 we'll
 see
 what
 he
 has
 to
 say.
 Again,


there
 it's
 a
 long
 after
 hours.
 Trump


usually
 takes
 these
 Q&As's
 pretty
 long,


so
 you
 can
 expect
 some
 violent
 moves
 if


he
 says
 something
 the
 market
 doesn't


like.
 Also,
 again,
 Ford
 and
 Intel.


That's
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 looking


like
 at
 right
 after
 the
 bell.
 And
 then


we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 we
 got.
 Chris
 is


not
 going
 to
 make
 it
 today.
 He's


actually
 going
 to
 Houston
 for
 a
 wedding.


So,
 Chris
 will
 not
 be
 here
 today.
 But
 we


got
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 headlines
 that
 we


will
 get
 into
 after
 the
 bell.
 Beyond


Meat,
 by
 the
 way,
 19%
 down.


Unfortunately,
 this
 one
 just
 did
 not


work
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 high
 beta
 momentum


traders.


Uh,
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 It's
 just
 one
 of


those
 names
 that
 had
 its
 day
 and
 wasn't


able
 to
 fully
 break
 through,
 but
 that


stock
 is
 down
 about
 20%
 on
 the
 day.


Chris
 is
 not
 getting
 married.
 Chris
 is


already
 married,
 but


he's
 going
 for
 a
 friend's
 wedding.
 Yes,


we
 also
 have
 deck
 earnings
 as
 well.
 We


got
 a
 bunch
 of
 companies.
 Got
 a
 bunch
 of


companies.
 But
 look,
 I
 think
 the
 story


of
 the
 day
 so
 far
 is
 that
 if
 this
 China


stuff
 is
 not
 as
 big
 a
 deal
 as
 people


think.
 Uh,
 and
 Trump's
 kind
 of
 been


signaling
 that
 throughout
 the
 day.
 Maybe


he
 says
 that
 as
 well
 in
 the
 Q&A.
 Uh,


that's
 going
 to
 be
 good.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 we're
 going


pretty
 much
 green
 to
 end
 out
 the
 day.


Very
 close
 alltime
 highs.
 Here
 we
 go,


folks.
 Thursday,
 October
 23rd.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 The
 stock


market


is
 now
 closed.


[Music]


All


right,
 there
 we
 go.
 We
 are
 done
 for
 the


day.
 Intel
 and
 Ford
 are
 up.
 Let
 me
 know


in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 own
 any
 one
 of
 these


names,
 whether
 it's
 Intel
 or
 Ford.
 S&P


67160.
 Great
 close.
 Great
 great
 close


after
 a
 really
 choppy
 first
 few
 days
 of


this
 week
 getting
 back
 into
 the
 670s
 and


actually
 closing
 above
 670.
 Very
 nice
 to


see
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 that's
 up
 1%.


Tesla
 up
 2.3.
 Palenteer
 180.4.
 Robin


Hood
 13409.
 Robin
 Hood
 great
 day
 as


well.
 SoFi
 that's
 up
 3%.
 Grabby
 Grab
 573


up
 2%
 day
 into
 the
 close.
 Amazon
 right


there
 1.36%.
 Meta
 basically
 flat
 did


touch
 740
 in
 the
 morning.
 Roblox
 up
 1%.


Crowd
 strike
 uh
 the
 CEO
 was
 on
 CNBC.
 I


don't
 know
 what
 he
 said.
 I
 don't
 think


they
 had
 any
 particular
 business
 results


came
 out
 but
 people
 were
 excited.
 The


one
 quote
 I
 did
 get
 from
 him
 was
 that


people
 should
 not
 be
 afraid
 of
 AI
 eating


software.
 They
 should
 be
 afraid
 of


software
 not
 being
 secure
 enough.
 Uh
 aka


AI
 is
 going
 to
 make
 software
 less
 secure


which
 means
 you
 you
 know
 you
 need
 cyber


security.
 And
 so
 Crowd
 Strike
 right


they're
 up
 4.3%
 on
 the
 day.
 Uber
 that's


up
 2.4%.
 Rocket
 Lab
 great
 day
 as
 well


5.67%.


Oaklo
 ends
 out
 the
 day
 up
 4.2%.
 So
 got
 a


bit
 of
 momentum
 again.
 Archer
 was
 a
 bit


flat.
 GameStop
 wow
 GameStop
 up
 four
 and


a
 half.
 Didn't
 expect
 GameStop
 to
 be
 up,


but
 that
 is
 up.
 And
 then
 you
 got
 Intel


right
 here.
 All right,
 Intel
 earnings.
 I


think
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 them.
 Are
 we


getting
 them?
 Let's
 see.


Um,


Intel
 is
 green.
 You're
 getting
 a
 move


right
 there
 on
 Intel.


Let's
 see.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 get
 anything.


Should
 be
 out
 right
 now.
 Intel
 is


moving.
 It
 was
 up
 4%
 during
 the
 day.


Yep.
 Oh,
 wow.
 Okay.
 Hold
 on.
 Is
 this


accurate?
 Before
 I
 say
 it,
 I
 want
 to


make
 sure
 it's
 accurate.
 Are
 you
 guys


seeing
 the
 same
 thing
 I'm
 seeing
 on
 EPS?


If
 this
 is
 accurate,
 this
 stock's
 going


to
 40.
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 going
 to
 40.


This
 is
 the
 number
 I
 have.
 This
 is
 not
 a


confirmed
 number.
 I
 want
 to
 confirm
 it


with
 multiple
 sources,
 but
 what
 I'm


looking
 at
 is
 they
 beat
 EPS
 by
 2,000%.


23
 cents
 versus
 1
 cent
 expected.
 13.6


billion
 versus
 13.14.
 Trying
 to
 confirm


if
 they
 actually
 did
 con.
 Yeah,
 that


looks
 like
 the
 number.
 It
 looks
 like
 the


number.
 That
 looks
 I
 have
 two
 sources,


three
 sources
 now
 confirming
 it.
 It


looks
 like
 they
 beat
 by
 two,000%.


Well,
 we
 know
 why
 Donny
 T
 invested
 now.


We
 know
 why
 Donny
 T
 invested
 now.
 I
 have


three
 sources
 I'm
 looking
 at
 saying
 this


is
 the
 number.
 It
 doesn't
 look
 fake.
 I


mean,
 the
 stock's
 not
 reacting
 like
 it's


fake.
 Dude,
 that's
 a
 big
 beat.
 23
 cents


a
 share.
 Are
 you
 kidding
 me?
 When
 the


street
 was
 expecting
 1
 cent.


That's
 a
 big
 beat.


You
 know,
 we
 all
 got
 to
 invest
 in


quantum
 now.
 If
 if
 if
 Trump
 actually


invests
 in
 quantum,
 then
 this
 is
 if
 this


is
 the
 trajectory
 that's
 we
 got
 to
 this


is
 what
 we
 got
 to
 do.
 This
 is
 what
 we


got
 to
 do
 to
 make
 some
 money.
 This
 is


what
 we
 got
 to
 do.
 All
 right.
 Some
 some


more
 results.
 Uh
 gross
 margins
 40%
 on


Intel
 in
 the
 third
 quarter
 versus
 36%


expected.
 That's
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 beat
 by
 4%.


Again,
 Intel's
 a
 hardware
 business,
 not


easy
 to
 squeak
 out
 a
 margin.
 Uh,
 that's


a
 4%
 beat.
 They
 see
 their
 third
 quarter


revenue
 13.65
 billion.
 That's
 up
 against


expectations.
 Fourth
 quarter
 revenue,


they're
 guiding
 for
 12.8
 to
 13.8.
 Data


center
 revenue
 4.12
 versus
 3.97.
 That's


a
 beat.
 Client
 computing
 revenue
 8.4


versus
 8.1.
 That's
 a
 beat.
 Foundry


revenue
 4.2
 versus
 4.5.
 That's
 a
 miss.


They
 missed
 on
 Foundry.
 They
 beat
 on


client
 computing.
 They
 beat
 on
 data


center.
 There.
 There.
 There
 it
 goes.
 40.


There
 you
 go.
 40
 bucks.
 As
 soon
 as
 I
 saw


the
 EPS
 beat,
 and
 I
 think
 as
 soon
 as
 you


guys
 saw
 it,
 it
 was
 pretty
 obvious
 this


one
 was
 going
 to
 fly.


This
 one
 was
 going
 to
 fly.
 There
 it
 is.


40
 bucks
 on
 Intel.
 5.7%
 now
 6.3%
 on
 the


day.


And
 those
 numbers
 are
 green.


Those
 numbers
 green.
 Intel
 always
 misses


on
 Foundry.
 Well,
 I
 guess
 the
 the
 the


beats
 on
 client
 computing
 and
 data


center
 revenue
 were
 enough
 to
 to
 make
 up


for
 that.
 We'll
 get
 to
 Trump's
 Q&A
 in
 a


second.
 I'm
 trying
 to
 get
 Ford
 numbers


as
 well,
 but
 those
 are
 the
 intel


numbers.
 I
 was
 thinking
 of
 taking
 a


gamble
 on
 it
 before
 the
 bell,
 but
 then
 I


was
 like,
 dude,
 it's
 up
 80%
 this
 year.


Like,
 you
 know,
 any
 any
 bad
 piece
 of


news,
 the
 street's
 just
 going
 to
 get


upset
 at
 it.
 They
 put
 up
 some
 good
 news.


They
 put
 up
 some
 good
 freaking
 news.


There
 you
 go.
 Beat
 by
 2200%.


Ford
 numbers
 are
 not
 out
 yet.
 I
 don't


think
 anything
 else
 is
 out.
 We're


looking
 for
 Ford.
 We're
 looking
 for


deck.
 We're
 looking
 for
 a
 couple
 other


companies.
 All
 we
 have
 right
 now
 is


Intel.
 Here
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 more


coverage
 on
 this.
 Looks
 like
 we've
 got


the
 report
 and
 then


we
 can
 go
 from
 there.


52-
 week
 highs.
 Yep.
 52-
 week
 highs
 on


Intel.


>> Time
 meeting.
 It
 nearly
 doubles
 here


from
 January
 1.
 Christina
 Parts
 Neville


has
 the
 numbers.
 Christina.


>> Uh,
 it
 was
 a
 little bit
 of
 a
 messy


report,
 John,
 for
 Intel
 given
 some


accounting
 changes.
 Intel
 posting
 a
 23


cent
 adjusted
 profit
 and
 better
 than


expected
 revenues
 of
 13.65
 billion.
 The


company
 also
 beat
 in
 their
 product


segment
 but
 missed
 with
 its
 foundry


business.
 Uh
 the
 AIPC
 also
 up
 double


digits.
 And
 I
 say
 that
 because
 I
 caught


up
 with
 Intel
 CFO
 Dave
 Zner
 just
 moments


ago
 and
 he
 told
 me
 that
 they
 are
 pretty


short
 on
 supply
 because
 the
 data
 center


refresh
 is
 happening
 quote
 faster
 than


anticipated.
 They
 met
 demand
 with


inventory
 on
 hand
 and
 he's
 saying
 that


they're
 going
 to
 be
 behind
 in
 Q1,


probably
 Q2,
 maybe
 even
 Q3
 because
 of


this
 supply
 crunch.
 He
 said
 they're
 also


doing
 a
 good
 job
 shoring
 up
 cash
 on


their
 balance
 sheet.
 Of
 course,
 we
 know


why.
 The
 US
 government's
 cash
 injection.


They
 also
 got
 money
 from
 selling
 a
 51%


stake
 in
 Alterara.
 Nvidia
 has
 a
 deal


with
 them,
 but
 has
 yet
 to
 pay
 in.
 So,


once
 Nvidia
 does
 pay
 in,
 uh,
 as
 said


that
 they
 could
 have
 about
 $35
 billion


in
 cash.
 Speaking
 of
 Altera,
 I
 bring


that
 up
 because
 they
 just
 sold
 their


stake
 in
 September.
 So,
 Wall
 Street


consensus
 numbers
 may
 not
 reflect
 that.


Also,
 why
 we're
 not
 comparing
 EPS
 guide.


Lastly,
 given
 the
 US
 government
 is
 now


Intel's
 biggest
 shareholder,
 I
 did
 ask


Intel
 CF
 CFO
 if
 Intel
 needs
 to,
 you


know,
 brief
 the
 government
 and
 he
 said,


"We
 don't
 tell
 them
 how
 the
 numbers
 are


going
 to
 be
 before
 the
 quarter,
 but
 we


talked
 to
 them
 like
 any
 other
 big


shareholder."
 He
 also
 said
 they're


making
 progress
 with
 their
 advanced
 chip


processes
 like
 14A,
 but
 they're
 still


not
 going
 to
 put
 in
 supply
 until
 they


have
 quote
 reaffirmed
 demand
 and
 they're


not
 expected
 to
 announce
 any
 customers.


We'll
 get
 more
 on
 the
 forward
 guidance


on
 the
 call
 at
 5:00
 p.
 p.m.
 Eastern,


guys.


>> All right,
 that's
 what
 you
 got
 for


Intel.
 We
 got
 some
 more
 earnings.
 Let's


take
 a
 look
 at
 it.
 Ford,
 uh,
 I
 think
 we


have
 a
 beat
 on
 Ford,
 folks.
 Ford
 is
 down


4%.
 Decker's
 also
 getting
 clobbered


right
 here.
 Um,
 Ford,
 yeah,
 beat
 by
 25%


on
 EPS,
 beat
 by
 7%
 on
 revenue,
 45
 cents


versus
 36
 cents.
 Regardless
 of
 what
 the


stock
 is
 doing,
 we
 as
 investors
 care


that
 companies
 are
 beating
 earnings


because
 that
 can
 continue
 to
 say
 that


the
 multiple
 on
 the
 S&P
 is
 not


overstretched.
 So,
 it's
 nice
 to
 see
 a


beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom
 on
 Intel


and
 Ford
 beat
 by
 7%
 on
 revenue,
 25%
 on


EPS.
 Stock
 is
 down
 4%
 right
 here.
 How


about
 Deck?
 Deckers
 is
 down


not
 as
 aggressively.
 Deckers.
 Well,
 now


down
 4%.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 get
 those


numbers
 there
 for
 deck.
 Deckers.
 Wow.


Top
 and
 the
 bottom
 beat
 by
 15%.
 EPS
 is


up
 14%
 year-over-year.
 182
 versus
 158


expected
 1.43
 versus
 1.42
 billion
 on


revenue.
 That's
 a
 beat
 by
 1%.
 EPS
 up


14%.
 Revenue
 up
 9%.
 Again,
 more
 and
 more


of
 these
 companies
 continuing
 to
 beat.


Pneumont
 that
 one
 is
 up
 after
 hours.
 Let


me
 try
 to
 get
 those
 earnings
 as
 well.


Wow,
 another
 double
 beat.
 19%
 EPS
 5%


revenue
 beat.
 Revenues
 up
 20%
 EPS
 up


111%.
 The
 the
 quick
 takeaway
 real
 quick


from
 all
 these
 companies
 that
 are


beating
 on
 EPS
 is
 that
 their
 margins
 are


probably
 getting
 better.
 Better
 than


what
 the
 street
 thought,
 which
 is
 why


they're
 able
 to
 beat
 these
 numbers,


margins
 getting
 better
 is
 likely
 because


of
 two
 letters,
 A
 and
 I.
 And
 if
 that
 is


true,
 and
 we
 hear
 a
 lot
 of
 that


commentary
 throughout
 this
 earning
 cycle


on
 these
 calls,
 then
 AI
 is
 creating


margin
 improvement,
 aka
 it
 should
 be


expanding
 the
 overall
 multiple
 on
 the


S&P
 or
 at least
 make
 sense
 of
 why
 the


multiple
 on
 the
 S&P
 is
 getting
 extended


67168
 after
 hours
 on
 the
 S&P.
 Intel


still
 at
 40,
 not
 losing
 40.
 And
 and
 and


by
 the
 way,
 if
 the
 if
 the
 margins
 are


crushing
 on
 these
 companies
 like
 an


Intel
 or
 a
 Ford
 or
 or
 a
 New
 Well,
 um
 you


can
 imagine
 that
 big
 tech
 is
 obviously


reaping
 the
 rewards
 of
 being
 able
 to


sell
 all
 the
 data,
 the
 compute,
 the


platforms,
 the
 the
 cloud
 workloads
 to
 be


able
 to
 get
 those
 margins
 to
 start


inflecting
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies.


Intel
 right
 there
 40.28.
 So
 it
 should


set
 up
 a
 decent
 big
 tech
 earning
 cycle


as
 we
 get
 into
 next
 week.
 AMD
 that's
 up


2.4%.
 Google
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 after
 hours


and
 then
 SoFi
 2804.
 S&P
 still
 at
 0.458%.


Not
 sure
 why
 Ford
 is
 getting
 hit.
 A


little
 bit
 of
 reverse.
 Uh
 they
 see
 their


adjusted
 free
 cash
 flow
 two
 to
 three


billion
 instead
 of
 3.5
 to
 four.
 So
 I


guess
 that's
 a
 little
 lower
 than


expected.
 Uh
 they
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of


an
 adjusted
 IBA
 hit
 in
 2025
 from
 one
 of


their
 factories
 that
 went
 on
 fire.


That's
 probably
 why
 it's
 getting
 hit.


And
 then
 Street
 wanted
 7.5
 billion
 of


adjusted
 Ebida
 for
 fiscal
 year
 26.


They're
 coming
 at
 6.5
 billion.
 Again,


not
 the
 worst
 miss,
 but
 nonetheless,


that's
 probably
 explaining
 why
 Ford
 is


getting
 hit
 right
 there.
 Intel,
 wow,


10%.
 She's
 not
 stopping.
 She's
 not


stopping.
 Nebia
 earnings
 is
 not
 today.


Nebia
 earnings
 is
 November
 11th.
 Nebia


earnings
 is
 November
 11th.
 Uh
 DLR,
 are


they
 reporting
 today?


They
 might
 be
 reporting
 today.
 Digital


Realy
 Trust,
 that's
 up
 3.82%.
 Let
 me
 see


if
 there's
 a
 couple
 other
 companies.


Intel
 and
 Ford
 were
 the
 big
 ones.
 Oh,


yeah.
 Digital
 Realy.
 Wow.


$510%


EPS
 beat.
 Oh
 my
 goodness.
 This
 is
 a
 $60


billion
 company,
 guys.
 3%
 beat
 on


revenue.
 Revenue
 is
 up
 10%


year-over-year.
 EPS
 up
 13%


year-over-year.
 $510%


EPS.


My
 goodness,
 dude.
 How
 much
 is
 this


stock
 up
 yearto
 date?
 DLR
 stock.
 It's


flat
 year
 to
 date
 and
 they're
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 boost
 after
 hours
 right


now.


Dude,
 this
 is
 not
 a
 joke.
 This
 is
 not
 a


joke
 in
 terms
 of
 some
 of
 this
 earnings


momentum
 that
 we're
 seeing.
 Let's
 get


some
 coverage
 on
 Ford
 and
 then
 we
 will


keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> Numbers
 from
 Ford.
 They
 beat
 by
 a
 wide


margin.
 Company
 earning
 45
 cents
 a


share,
 well
 above
 the
 street
 expectation


of
 36
 cents
 a
 share.
 revenue
 47
 just


over
 47
 billion
 $4
 billion
 greater
 than


what
 Wall
 Street
 was
 expecting
 the


metrics
 within
 the
 quarter
 you're


looking
 at
 an
 EBIT
 of
 2.6
 6
 billion.


>> Dude,
 that's
 kind
 of
 crazy.
 A
 $4
 billion


revenue
 beat.
 I
 mean,
 what
 is
 Ford
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day?
 It's
 a
 company
 that


sells
 cars.
 Consumers
 were
 willing
 to
 p


purchase
 four
 billion
 more
 worth
 of
 Ford


vehicles
 than
 what
 the
 street
 expected.


I
 mean,
 again,
 there
 are
 some
 cracks
 in


the
 economy
 of
 them,
 but
 maybe
 that's


not
 signaling
 that
 a
 recession
 is
 around


the
 corner
 right
 now.


>> For
 the
 quarter,
 flat
 with
 comparison
 to


last
 year.
 EBIT
 margin
 5.1%
 little
 below


5.5%
 last
 year
 and
 then
 the
 other


metrics
 uh
 cash
 flow
 free
 cash
 flow
 of


4.3
 billion
 well
 above
 where
 they
 were


last
 year.
 Each
 of
 the
 divisions


remember
 Ford
 breaks
 it
 up
 by
 their


three
 divisions
 here.
 Commercial


vehicles
 continues
 to
 do
 very
 well.
 A


profit
 of
 $
 1.98
 billion
 in
 the
 quarter.


Internal
 combustion
 engine
 vehicles
 $


1.54
 billion
 profit.
 EVs.
 Despite


selling
 more
 EVs,
 they
 lost
 more
 money


compared
 to
 a
 year
 ago.
 Lost
 $1.41


billion
 dollars
 with
 the
 EV
 business.


The
 tariff
 cost
 impact,
 it's
 going
 to


work
 out
 to
 be
 about
 a
 billion
 dollars


this
 year.
 That's
 well
 below
 what
 many


thought
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 when
 the


tariffs
 were
 first
 implemented.
 It's
 not


too
 bad
 for
 Ford.
 Less
 cost
 on
 the


tariffs
 as
 well,
 which
 is
 pretty
 good.


You
 would
 expect
 Ford
 to
 potentially


recover
 right
 here.
 Already
 getting
 a


green
 candle
 after
 hours.
 And
 then
 Intel


still
 moving
 40.17.
 It
 almost
 broke
 41


got
 very
 close
 40.88


but
 did
 not
 officially
 break
 some
 of


those
 levels.
 Okay,
 so
 I
 think
 those
 are


most
 of
 the
 earnings.
 We
 did
 have


Western
 Union
 as
 well.
 Earnings
 beat
 on


EPS
 um
 47
 cents
 versus
 46
 cents.
 And


then
 revenue
 that
 is
 also
 a
 slight
 beat


still
 down
 year-over-year.
 Western
 Union


this
 is
 the
 money
 transfer
 uh
 company


people
 still
 use
 it
 up
 2.9%.
 up
 2.9%


on
 Western
 Union.


Okay,
 let
 me
 get
 to
 Trump
 because
 I


think
 he's
 taking
 some
 questions
 right


now.
 Then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


But
 uh
 I'll
 be
 looking
 at
 some
 other


earnings.
 Intel
 and
 Ford,
 those
 those


were
 the
 big
 ones
 and
 we'll
 try
 to
 get


some
 more
 updates
 on
 what's
 going
 on


with
 them
 in
 uh
 in
 just
 a
 second.


>> That
 please
 because
 I
 cannot
 understand


the
 words
 you're
 saying.
 Where
 are
 you?


Where
 are
 you
 from?


>> Where
 are
 you
 from?


>> I'm
 from


>> You're
 from
 France.
 beautiful
 accent,


but
 we
 can't
 understand
 what
 you're


saying.


>> No,


>> she
 said
 on
 the
 west
 bank.


>> Okay,
 we'll
 get
 back
 to
 that
 when
 we
 can


actually
 get
 a
 question
 that
 Trump
 can


understand
 from
 from
 what
 the
 reporter


is
 talking
 about.
 We
 do
 have
 one
 other


earnings
 fix.
 Let
 me
 pull
 that
 up.
 He


was
 like,
 "Dude,
 it's
 a
 beautiful


country,
 but
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 what
 you're


saying."
 Fix
 uh
 this
 was
 their
 Q3
 2025.


Uh
 296
 or
 291
 million
 in
 net
 income,


2.45
 billion
 in
 revenue.
 This
 is
 an
 HVAC


company.
 We
 talked
 about
 it
 a
 couple


weeks
 ago.
 Fix
 right
 here.
 Fix
 comfort


systems.
 Wow.
 18%
 move.


18%
 move
 on
 fix.
 Whether
 it's
 HVAC,


semiconductors,
 or
 F-150s,
 you
 are


seeing
 across
 the
 board
 some
 pretty


massive
 earnings
 beats.
 Even
 on
 Deckers,


I
 know
 the
 stock
 is
 down,
 but
 Deckers,


which
 is
 another
 consumer
 brand
 for


outdoor
 materials,
 shoes,
 all
 that


stuff,
 they
 beat
 EPS
 by
 15%.


First
 of
 all,
 it's
 showing
 there's
 a
 ton


of
 HVAC
 demand,
 but
 it's
 also
 showing


that
 the
 broader
 economy
 maybe
 is
 not
 in


the
 worst
 situation.
 2.14
 billion
 on


revenue
 for
 fix
 and
 net
 income
 of
 291


million.
 Stocks
 up
 18%
 right
 here.


That's
 pretty
 incredible.
 That
 is
 pretty


freaking
 incredible.
 Intel
 right
 here


40.25
 that
 is
 still
 up
 about
 9%


um
 on
 the
 day.
 We
 do
 have
 a
 headline
 as


well.
 Target
 is
 going
 to
 be
 laying
 off


about
 1,800
 people.
 Seeing
 that
 headline


right
 here.
 Yeah,
 let
 me
 get
 this
 right


now
 and
 then
 we'll
 we'll
 keep
 going.


>> Most
 on
 quad.
 Well,
 we've
 got
 a
 news


alert
 now
 on
 Target.
 Melissa
 Repco
 has


the
 story.
 Melissa.


>> Hey,
 John.
 Uh
 we
 just
 heard
 from
 Target


that
 in
 a
 memo
 to
 employees,
 it's


announced
 that
 it's
 cutting
 1,800
 jobs


across
 the
 company.
 That
 represents


about
 8%
 of
 Target's
 corporate


workforce.
 It's
 not
 cutting
 any
 roles
 to


stores
 or
 to
 supply
 chain,
 but
 that


represents
 the
 uh
 largest
 major
 layoffs


in
 a
 decade,
 John.
 And
 in
 a
 memo
 to


employees,
 its
 incoming
 CEO,
 Michael


Fidelki,
 talked
 about
 evaluating
 the


organization.
 And
 he
 said
 that
 this
 cut


is
 meant
 to
 get
 the
 company
 back
 to


growth
 faster.
 In
 the
 memo,
 he
 said,


"The
 truth
 is
 the
 complexity
 we've


created
 over
 time
 has
 been
 holding
 us


back.
 Too
 many
 layers
 and
 overlapping


work
 has
 slowed
 decisions,
 making
 it


harder
 to
 bring
 ideas
 to
 life."
 Michael


Fideli
 is
 taking
 over
 officially
 in


February.
 He's
 succeeding
 longtime
 CEO


Brian
 Cornell.
 And
 he
 it's
 interesting


that
 he's
 been
 overseeing
 an
 effort
 to


kind
 of
 get
 that
 company
 turned
 around.


Its
 shares
 are
 down
 about
 65%
 since
 its


all-time
 high
 back
 in
 2021
 when
 it
 was


uh
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 gains
 from
 the


pandemic.
 And


>> all
 right,
 so
 Target
 saying
 they
 got
 to


lay
 some
 people
 off.
 Now,
 here's
 the


question
 for
 everyone
 in
 the
 chat.
 By


the
 way,
 Target
 stock
 Intel
 still


moving.
 Target
 up
 a
 little bit
 on
 this


news.
 Here's
 the
 question.
 Do
 we
 think


Target
 is
 firing
 people
 because
 they


have
 less
 demand
 and
 the
 business
 is
 not


going
 that
 well
 and
 the
 consumer
 isn't


shopping
 that
 much
 at
 Target
 or
 do
 you


think
 AI
 is
 making
 them
 more
 efficient


and
 they're
 realizing
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


mid-management
 people
 a
 lot
 of
 white


collar
 work
 this
 is
 all
 corporate
 by
 the


way
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 they're
 talking


about
 people
 that
 are
 actually
 in
 the


stores
 they're
 talking
 about
 corporate
 I


mean
 are
 they
 thinking
 hey
 maybe
 we


don't
 need
 all
 these
 corporate


bureaucrats
 inside
 of
 Target
 because
 we


are
 more
 efficient
 without
 them
 I
 mean


target
 stock
 is
 not
 had
 the
 best
 story


over
 the
 past
 couple
 years,
 but
 from
 all


the
 earnings
 we're
 seeing,
 it's
 not


looking
 like
 it's
 a
 demand
 problem
 with


the
 economy,
 at least
 at
 its
 core.
 Um,


especially
 when
 we're
 getting
 these


topline
 beats.
 Maybe
 it's
 more
 due
 to


AI.


See
 a
 lot
 more
 people
 saying
 AI.
 All


right,
 let's
 go
 back
 to
 Trump.
 Let's
 see


if
 we
 get
 some
 of
 these
 questions
 and


then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> And
 what
 are
 your
 continued
 goals
 with


this
 task
 force
 now
 that
 you
 have
 about


three
 years
 left?
 Well,
 the
 best
 thing


we
 have
 going
 is
 we
 have
 such
 talent


around
 this
 tab.
 I
 could
 go
 over
 every


one
 of
 these
 men
 and
 women
 and
 we
 have


unbelievable
 talent.
 They've
 got
 the


naturals,
 you
 know,
 like
 somebody
 that


hits
 a
 baseball
 or
 a
 golf
 ball
 or
 a,
 you


know,
 that
 you
 see
 more.
 It's
 more


evident.
 It's
 beautiful
 because
 it's


sports.
 You
 can
 tell
 somebody
 right


away,
 are
 they
 good
 or
 are
 they
 not


these
 people,
 the
 most
 talented
 people


at
 what
 they
 do.
 And
 when
 we
 started


talking
 about
 this,
 Stephen
 and
 all
 of


us,
 it
 was
 it
 seems
 so
 easy.
 What
 what


is
 surprising
 to
 me
 is
 how
 quickly
 we


can
 straighten
 out
 a
 large
 city,
 a
 big


city,
 a
 mean
 city,
 a
 city
 that's
 sick,


that
 got
 very
 sick
 with
 guns
 all
 over


the
 place,
 with
 bullets
 shooting
 all


over
 where
 you
 I
 mean,
 you
 you
 take
 your


life
 in
 your
 hands
 if
 you
 go
 out
 and
 buy


a
 loaf
 of
 bread.
 That's
 not
 America.


That's
 not
 our
 country.
 And
 those
 people


don't
 care
 how
 you
 do
 it.
 They
 just
 want


it
 done.
 They
 really
 do.
 You
 know,
 when


you
 go
 to
 the
 people
 in
 the
 street,


they're
 not


>> I
 I
 believe
 Trump
 is
 talking
 about
 the


task
 force
 in
 San
 Francisco
 that
 they


want
 to
 be
 deploying
 the
 National
 Guard


at,
 but
 this
 entire
 round
 table
 was


about
 crime
 and
 what
 the
 administration


is
 doing
 on
 crime.


>> But
 I
 think
 the
 biggest
 thing
 we
 we
 say


is
 we
 have
 tremendous
 talent.
 We
 were


able
 to
 recognize
 like
 a
 football
 team,


like
 a
 baseball
 team.
 We
 were
 able
 to


recognize
 the
 talent
 and
 the
 talent
 is


largely
 in
 this
 room
 for
 the
 whole


country.
 It's
 largely
 in
 this
 room.


There's
 really
 nothing
 like
 it.
 And


that's
 why
 in
 I
 think
 we
 had
 DC
 done,


not
 perfectly,
 but
 pretty
 much
 done
 at


least
 normalized
 in
 12
 days.
 Wouldn't


you
 say
 twelt


different?
 And
 then
 and
 you
 know
 we
 took


a
 lot
 of
 bad
 people
 out
 never
 to
 never


to
 come
 back
 again
 then
 most
 of
 them


never
 to
 come
 back
 again
 but
 there's


great
 talent
 and
 there's
 also
 great


courage.
 It's
 you
 know
 it's
 I've
 been


watching
 what
 goes
 on
 and
 then
 you
 have


the
 radical
 left
 lunatics
 and
 what's


that
 all
 about?
 I
 mean
 they're
 fighting


us
 because
 we
 want
 to
 stop
 crime.
 Where


do
 these
 people
 come
 from?
 their
 paid


money.
 I
 guess
 they're
 paid
 a
 lot
 of


money,
 but
 like
 I
 saw
 that
 ridiculous


march
 the
 other
 day.
 I
 see
 these
 people


are
 not
 representative
 of
 our
 country


and
 not
 all
 of
 them
 of
 course,
 but
 many


of
 them
 are
 total
 low
 lives.
 These
 are


low
 lives.
 These
 are
 people
 that
 are


paid
 agitators


and
 they're
 not
 representative
 of
 our


country.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 can
 just


tell
 you
 that
 our
 country
 has
 tremendous


spirit
 right
 now.
 You
 know
 that
 better


than
 anybody
 cuz
 you
 cover
 it
 well.
 But


we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 are
 very


happy
 right
 now
 with
 the
 direction.
 They


did
 a
 poll
 the
 other
 day.
 The
 direction


of
 our
 country
 is
 better
 than
 it's
 been


in
 37
 years.
 And
 I'm
 upset
 because
 I


think
 it's
 it
 should
 be
 better
 than


that.
 I
 actually
 said
 we
 should
 be


better
 than
 that.
 So,
 you
 know,
 thank


you
 very
 much
 for
 your
 question,
 Brian.


>> Brian.


>> Mr.
 President.
 Yes.
 Thank
 you,
 Mr.


President.
 You
 guys
 have
 done
 an
 amazing


job
 in
 Memphis.
 Some
 of
 those
 numbers


are
 staggering.
 and
 we've
 gotten
 message


on
 social
 media
 wanting
 to
 thank
 you
 for


that.
 But
 I
 think
 Can
 you
 talk
 about
 the


number
 of
 missing
 children
 you
 guys
 have


discovered
 in
 Memphis?
 That's
 amazing.


>> Well,
 it's
 uh
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 were


lost
 through
 Biden
 and
 the
 Biden


administration,
 and
 we
 are
 getting
 a
 lot


of
 them
 back,
 but
 they're
 either
 dead,


they're
 slaves,
 they're
 captured
 in
 some


form.
 But
 think
 of
 it,
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 we're
 talking
 about.
 Not
 even


believable.
 When
 they
 came
 in
 through


the
 border,
 they
 were
 sold.
 They
 were


bargained
 for.
 And
 this
 was
 all
 Biden.


Meaning
 Biden
 and
 Obama,
 the
 same,
 you


know,
 the
 same
 mentality.
 Frankly,
 I


think
 it's
 the
 same
 mentality.
 Let
 me


tell
 you,
 Barack
 Hussein
 Obama
 was
 a


lousy
 president.
 A
 lot
 of
 bad
 things


happened.
 Remember
 when
 they
 used
 to


talk
 about
 Trump
 with
 the
 jail
 cells?


Well,
 he
 built
 the
 jail
 cells
 for
 the


children.
 He
 built
 those
 jail
 cells.


Remember
 that
 came
 out?
 But
 sir,
 they


were
 built
 in
 20.
 Okay,
 so
 we
 are
 not


getting
 any
 market
 questions.
 I
 thought


they
 would
 ask
 him
 some
 more
 stuff
 about


China
 or
 his
 quantum
 investments.
 We're


not
 getting
 any
 of
 that.
 Hopefully,


we'll
 get
 them
 later.
 We'll
 get
 to
 see


what
 he's
 saying.
 Intel
 still
 moving


after
 hours.
 Intel
 right
 here,
 40.2.
 I'm


going to
 do
 a
 poll
 right
 here
 in
 the


chat
 based
 on
 that
 same
 question
 that
 I


asked
 a
 couple
 minutes
 ago.
 Do
 you
 think


Target
 is
 laying
 off
 people
 because
 of


AI
 or
 because
 of
 consumer
 demand?
 82%
 of


you
 said
 Intel
 would
 outperform
 Ford.


Majority
 of
 you
 were
 right
 on
 that.
 Is


Target
 laying
 off
 due
 to
 demand
 issues


or
 AI?


I'll
 put
 the
 both
 option
 there
 for
 those


that
 really
 can't
 decide.
 I
 I
 I
 mean


again
 I
 I
 got
 to
 look
 deeper
 into
 the


announcement.
 If
 if
 they
 had
 said
 we
 are


laying
 off
 uh
 people
 in
 the
 store
 that


are
 working
 in
 the
 shelves,
 then
 that's


a
 different
 question.
 That's
 like
 oh
 you


don't
 have
 enough
 people
 buying
 stuff
 to


support
 those
 people.
 You're
 talking


about
 corporate.
 I
 mean,
 again,


corporate
 comes
 down
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 people


sitting
 in
 a
 fancy
 office.
 Like,
 if


they're
 laying
 off
 those
 people,
 that


feels
 a
 bit
 more
 AI
 to
 me
 than
 actually


the
 consumer's
 weak.
 But
 ultimately,


we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 a
 bit
 more
 to


see
 if
 that
 plays
 out.
 We
 do
 have
 this


clip
 from
 Trump
 right
 here.
 Let
 me
 um


pull
 this
 up
 right
 now.
 This
 was
 him


discussing
 Jensen
 actually
 giving
 him
 a


call.


a
 little
 earlier
 ago.
 Yeah,
 most
 people


of
 you
 guys
 saying
 AI
 target
 stock
 also


has
 been
 in
 the
 gutter.
 That
 is
 fair.


That
 is
 fair.
 Okay,
 this
 was
 from
 a


couple
 minutes
 ago.


As
 you
 probably
 know,
 maybe
 you
 heard
 we


were
 going
 to
 do
 a
 big
 surge
 in
 San


Francisco,
 but
 I
 call
 got
 a
 great
 call


from
 some
 incredible
 people,
 some


friends
 of
 mine,
 very
 successful
 people.


uh
 Mark
 who's
 everybody
 knows
 him
 and


Jensen
 everybody
 knows
 Jensen


Nvidia


uh
 and
 others
 called
 me
 from
 San


Francisco
 and
 they
 said
 we're
 working


really
 really
 hard
 with
 the
 mayor
 we're


making
 progress
 would
 it
 be
 possible
 for


you
 hold
 off
 for
 you
 to
 hold
 off
 the


surge
 and
 I
 had
 four
 or
 five
 calls
 and
 I


think
 they're
 making
 progress
 of
 their


own
 that
 would
 be
 the
 greatest
 I
 mean
 if


they
 could
 do
 that
 that
 would
 be
 great


and
 And
 they
 have
 great
 confidence
 in


those
 people.
 I
 mean,
 incredible


competence,
 some
 of
 the
 smartest


business
 leaders.
 And
 they're
 working


very
 well
 with
 the
 police
 department.


They're
 doing
 a
 good
 job.
 So,
 we
 are


holding
 off
 that
 surge,
 everybody.
 And


we're
 going
 to
 let
 them
 see
 if
 they
 can


do
 it.
 I
 said,
 I
 think
 we
 can
 do
 it
 much


fast.
 I
 know
 we
 can
 do
 it
 faster.
 I


think
 we
 can
 do
 it
 better
 than
 anybody.


We
 can
 take
 criminals
 out.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 you
 got
 Trump
 saying


Jensen
 from
 whatever
 company
 he
 said.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that's
 Nvidia,
 but
 it's


it's
 a
 it's
 kind
 of
 sounded
 like
 it,


kind
 of
 didn't
 sound
 like
 it.
 Um,
 kind


of
 laying
 off
 the
 San
 Francisco
 stuff,


which
 does
 make
 sense.
 You
 had
 Mark
 Beni


off
 retrace
 his
 comments
 after
 saying


that
 Trump
 should
 deploy
 the
 National


Guard.
 Maybe
 Jensen
 called
 as
 well
 and


said
 San
 Francisco,
 we'll
 figure
 it
 out.


But
 you
 got
 Jensen
 kind
 of
 taking
 or
 you


got
 Trump
 basically
 saying,
 "All
 right,


if
 that's
 the
 case,
 then
 we're
 not
 going


to
 deploy
 the
 National
 Guard,
 at least


right
 now."
 And
 they're
 focusing
 on
 some


other
 countries.
 Intel
 right
 here,
 4050.


Let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 bought


Intel
 on
 the
 surge.
 I
 think
 right
 at


3850ish


is
 when
 the
 earnings
 came
 out
 and
 then


you
 got
 a
 move
 right
 here.
 And
 also
 let


me
 know
 if
 you're
 selling.
 I
 mean,
 if


you're
 up
 a
 buck
 or
 two
 bucks,
 maybe
 you


don't
 risk
 it
 going
 into
 tomorrow.


Intel's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 give
 a
 pretty


good
 earnings
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 have


to
 say
 some
 stuff
 that's
 really
 good
 for


the
 street
 to
 continue
 to
 be
 excited.


But
 this
 is
 what
 you
 have


on
 Intel
 right
 now.
 No,
 we
 got
 a
 decent


dude.
 A
 decent
 amount
 of
 you


got
 into
 it.
 Bought
 600
 shares,
 bought


300
 shares,
 bought
 500
 shares,


bought
 2,000
 shares
 this
 afternoon.


Okay,
 well
 then
 you're
 doing
 okay.
 2,000


shares
 this
 afternoon.
 Let's
 get
 a


little
 bit
 more
 coverage
 on
 Intel
 and


then
 we'll
 get
 Karp
 on
 uh
 Fox
 Business,


>> semiconductor
 and
 hardware
 research


analyst
 at
 Wedbush.
 He's
 got
 a
 neutral


rating
 on
 Intel.
 Uh
 Matt,
 I'm
 looking
 at


the
 gross
 margins
 here,
 which
 have
 had


been
 an
 issue
 for
 investors
 uh
 until
 the


federal
 government
 bought
 in.
 I
 mean,


given
 that
 it's
 uh
 chasing
 uh
 this


demand
 issue,
 demand
 strong,
 supply
 not


keeping
 up,
 but
 their
 margins
 are
 still


pressured,
 I
 guess,
 because
 of
 their


ability
 to
 load
 the
 fabs
 here.
 Um
 is


Intel
 doing
 a
 lot
 better?


>> I
 I
 I
 think
 the
 end
 markets
 are
 a
 lot


better.
 Um,
 so
 Micron
 told
 you
 the
 PC


market
 uh
 was
 going
 to
 be
 flat
 at
 one


point.
 Now
 it's
 going
 to
 grow
 mid-


single
 digits.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 you're
 seeing


that
 in
 Intel's
 numbers.
 I
 I
 think


you're
 seeing
 the
 fact
 that
 AI
 is


pulling
 standard
 servers.


>> Dude,
 look
 at
 that
 gross
 margin


inflection
 27.5
 to
 38.2.


I
 mean,
 that's
 pretty
 incredible.
 So,
 if


they
 can
 keep
 that
 getting
 up
 anywhere


near
 40
 or
 45%
 like
 you
 know
 Nvidia,


they're
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 get
 to


like
 70%
 like
 Nvidia,
 but
 still
 that's


going
 to
 be
 good
 and
 that's
 probably
 why


they
 beat
 on
 EPS
 23
 cents
 versus
 1
 cent


expected.


>> Um,
 and
 that's
 uh
 creating
 more
 demand


for
 Intel
 Xeon
 products
 and
 and
 that's


what
 Intel's
 showing
 you.
 Not
 necessar


the
 company's
 in
 better
 place,
 but
 that


it's
 markets
 are
 in
 a
 better
 place.


>> So,
 given
 that
 at
 these
 levels,
 if
 it's


trading
 here
 tomorrow,
 the
 stock
 has


basically
 doubled
 since
 January
 1st.


What
 do
 you
 have
 to
 believe
 to
 believe


it's
 worth
 it?
 Do
 you
 have
 to
 believe


that
 the
 foundry
 strategy
 is
 gonna
 work?


Uh,
 do
 you
 have
 to
 believe
 that
 they're


going
 to
 get
 more
 customers
 than
 they


have
 or
 compete
 more
 effectively
 with


AMD?


>> I
 I
 I
 think
 that's


>> Intel
 41.


Intel
 41.


Wow.


Well,
 look,
 if
 you're
 an
 American
 and


you
 pay
 taxes
 to
 America,
 I
 mean,


technically,
 we're
 up.


We're
 all
 up.
 We
 we
 we
 can't
 decide
 to


sell
 or
 not.
 We
 we
 really
 can't
 decide


to
 do
 anything
 with
 our
 Intel
 stake.
 I


guess
 Trump
 and
 the
 uh
 the
 VCs
 at
 the


White
 House
 will
 figure
 that
 out.
 But
 we


all
 own
 a
 little
 bitty
 piece
 of
 Intel.


4120.


That's
 up
 12%.


I
 mean,
 look,
 not
 bad.
 It's
 what
 we


wanted
 to
 see,
 what
 you
 want
 to
 see.
 Fix


Comfort
 Systems,
 that's
 up
 19%
 again,


massive
 beat
 on
 earnings.
 I
 think
 the


theme
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 earnings
 that


we've
 seen,
 and
 I
 know
 we've
 only


covered
 like
 20
 of
 them
 over
 the
 past


two
 weeks,
 and
 next
 week's
 going
 to
 be


the
 real
 big
 one.
 But
 every
 single


company,
 Digital
 Reality,
 510%
 beat.


Next
 tracker,
 we
 didn't
 look
 at
 this


one.
 uh
 18%
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 line
 or
 on


the
 bottom
 line
 8%
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 line


in
 905
 versus
 839
 119
 versus
 101
 beat
 by


18%


again
 on
 EPS.
 Next
 tracker
 is
 a
 $13


billion
 company.
 That
 stock
 is
 up
 128%


year
 to
 date.
 It's
 a
 solar
 tracker


manufacturing
 company.
 Solar
 tracker


manufacturing.
 I've
 never
 really
 heard


of
 this
 one.
 Uh
 I
 wonder
 if
 Nphase
 is


getting
 any
 green
 because
 of
 that.
 But


no
 end
 phase
 is
 flat.
 Ticker
 symbol
 on


this
 is
 NXT.


NXT.


There
 you
 go.
 14%
 move.


14%
 move.


And
 that
 continues
 to
 go
 green.
 AMD
 as


well
 up
 1.5%
 after
 hours.
 Look
 at
 that.


AMD,
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 it's
 moving
 after


hours,
 but
 it
 is
 moving
 238.
 Trying
 to


get
 back
 to
 that
 240
 level.
 Nvidia
 also


moving
 a
 little
 bit
 after
 hours.
 Nvidia


did
 announce
 that
 Uber
 partnership,
 but


no
 other
 big
 stuff
 I
 saw
 from
 Nvidia


today.


both
 those
 moving.
 Oh,
 a
 couple
 updates


from
 China.
 So,
 China's
 vice
 premere
 uh


is
 going
 to
 be
 meeting
 the
 US
 Treasury


Secretary
 uh
 and
 Jameson
 Greer
 starting


tomorrow
 in
 in
 uh
 in
 in
 in
 hopes
 of
 the


meeting
 with
 Trump
 and
 Xi
 starting
 on


October
 30th.
 So,
 to
 prepare
 for
 that


meeting,
 you've
 got
 those
 two
 meeting


first,
 which
 is
 good
 to
 see.
 And
 that


will
 likely
 lead
 to
 a
 broader
 beating
 by


all
 all
 the
 uh
 parties
 going
 into


October
 30th.
 Iran
 also
 up
 8%
 of the


day.
 ASML
 is
 moving.
 Wow.
 All
 the
 semis


getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 after


hours.
 Not
 sure
 why.
 Oh,
 let's
 go
 to


Trump.
 Maybe
 maybe
 he's
 saying


something.


It's
 getting
 the
 street
 excited.


>> That
 very
 hard,
 right?


[Music]


>> No,
 sir.
 Mr.
 President,
 go
 ahead.


>> Thank
 you,
 sir.
 um
 when
 when
 you
 were


running
 for
 reelection
 in
 2024,
 you


released
 a
 video
 statement
 where
 you
 did


this
 you
 made
 this
 exact
 promise
 to
 show


no
 mercy
 on
 the
 cartels
 and
 employ
 every


military
 asset
 necessary
 to
 combat
 them.


In
 that
 same
 video,
 you
 also
 said
 that


you
 plan
 to
 expose
 all
 the
 bribes
 and


corruptions
 with
 politicians
 and
 the


cartels
 that
 been
 looking
 into
 that
 in


American
 politicians.


>> Yeah.
 where
 the
 money's
 coming
 from


because
 you
 see
 it
 like
 even
 that


garbage
 deal
 they
 had
 this
 weekend
 which


was
 embarrassing
 to
 them
 and
 the
 crowds


were
 much
 more
 the
 crowds
 were
 not
 big


those
 crowds
 were
 not
 big
 at
 all
 but


>> okay
 so
 we're
 not
 getting
 a
 lot
 of


business
 questions
 here
 ASML
 is
 still


moving
 I
 I
 don't
 have
 any
 Trump
 quotes


of
 him
 saying
 something
 that
 would


affect
 the
 semiconductors


and
 no
 one's
 really
 asking
 him
 about


market
 stuff
 it's
 more
 political
 stuff


but
 ASML
 is
 moving
 Intel
 still
 moving
 as


well.
 Wow.
 4135.


4135


on
 the
 day
 for
 Intel.


Applied
 materials
 to
 reduce
 workforce
 by


4%
 expects
 160
 to
 180
 million
 in
 charges


to
 be
 recognized
 in
 Q4.
 Reduction
 to
 be


completed
 in
 Q126.
 All right,
 so
 that's


another
 company
 along
 with
 Target
 saying


that
 we're
 going to
 lay
 off
 some
 people.


Applied
 materials
 right
 there
 4%
 up
 on


the
 day.
 AMRO
 that
 should
 be
 moving
 as


well.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 look,
 Intel's


earnings
 is
 a
 precursor
 for
 Amcor
 I


think
 because
 again
 the
 whole
 thesis
 on


AMCOR
 is
 American
 manufacturing
 and
 if


Intel
 is
 beating
 EPS
 by
 20%.
 Again,


Amcore
 trades
 that
 onetime
 sales.
 So
 if


they
 can
 have
 any
 level
 of
 a
 Intel
 type


of
 beat
 or
 even
 you
 know
 onetenth
 of


that
 they
 can
 beat
 by
 20%
 instead
 of


2,000%.
 That
 would
 still
 be
 a
 good
 thing


for
 Amar.
 Tesla
 right
 there
 447
 that's


green
 after
 hours.
 Uh
 and
 then
 Google


getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 boost.
 Wow,


look
 at
 that
 green
 candle.
 252
 to
 254.


Got
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks.
 Trump's
 not
 saying


anything.
 I
 don't
 get
 any
 headlines


from
 Trump
 that's
 causing
 the
 semis
 and


the
 hypers
 skills.
 Oh,
 no.
 We
 got


something.


No,
 no,
 we
 don't.
 No,
 we
 do.
 Anthropic,


they
 confirmed
 the
 deal.
 They
 confirmed


the
 deal.
 Anthropic
 confirms
 Google


Cloud
 deal.
 Anthropic
 to
 expand
 use
 of


Google
 Cloud
 TPUs.
 Anthropic
 said
 deal


is
 worth
 tens
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars.


That
 is
 what
 we
 got.
 Wow.


Two
 seconds
 ago.
 Anthropic
 confirming


the
 rumor.
 Now,
 Google
 hit
 258
 last
 time


that
 happened.
 Maybe
 Google
 gets
 back
 up


there.
 It's
 moving
 a
 little
 bit.
 It's


not
 moving
 back
 to
 those
 levels
 yet.


Anthropic
 confirming


the
 Google
 partnership.
 Tens
 of
 billions


of
 dollars
 is
 the
 news.
 They
 will
 expand


the
 use
 of
 Google
 TPUs
 and
 services.


Anthropic
 will
 train
 and
 serve
 clawed


models
 with
 plans
 to
 access
 up
 to
 1


million
 TPUs
 worth
 tens
 of
 billions
 of


dollars.
 In
 total,
 Anthropic
 will
 have


access
 to
 well
 over
 a
 gigawatt
 of


capacity
 coming
 online
 in
 2026.
 Where's


Amazon
 on
 this?
 Google
 now
 moving
 a


little
 bit
 more.
 Amazon


uh
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 red
 candle
 as


Anthropic's
 not
 continuing
 to
 work
 with


them.
 For
 Anthropic,
 it
 makes
 sense.


They
 should
 be
 diversifying
 their
 their


cloud
 providers.


But
 Google
 is
 up.


Google
 is
 up.
 Wow.
 There
 you
 go.


There
 you
 go.
 All
 right.
 So,
 you're


getting
 some
 momentum
 on
 the
 Googles.


Dell
 after
 hours.
 That's
 up
 a
 little


bit.
 Again,
 SMCI
 had
 the
 the
 thing
 about


SMCI.
 If
 you
 if
 you're
 deep
 into
 this,
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 something
 to
 worry


about
 to
 that
 extent.
 They
 affirmed


their
 fiscal
 year
 guidance
 of
 33


billion.
 They're
 just
 shifting
 some
 of


the
 revenue
 that
 you
 expected
 in
 Q2,
 6.5


billion.
 they
 came
 in
 at
 5
 billion
 uh
 to


Q3.
 So,
 and
 they
 operate
 on
 a
 different


fiscal
 year.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 I
 don't


think
 SMCI
 is
 like
 like
 given
 the
 demand


is
 there
 and
 it's
 outstripping
 supply


still
 is
 what
 they
 said
 and
 Dell


increased
 their
 earnings
 dramatically
 on


the
 terms
 of
 the
 projections.
 I
 feel


like
 that
 SMCI
 dip
 will
 get
 bought,
 but


SMCI
 is
 down
 about
 6%
 on
 the
 day
 or
 7%.


Google
 right
 there
 now
 up
 1.7
 after


hours.
 256.
 Broadcom
 should
 be
 moving


with
 Google.
 Let's
 see.
 Broadcom
 is


indeed
 moving
 with
 Google.
 Is
 indeed


moving
 with
 Google.
 350


up
 3%
 with
 the
 googs
 and
 then
 Intel.


Intel
 sold
 4122.
 Got
 up
 to
 4150.


Couldn't
 break
 42
 yet.


Okay,
 look.
 Not
 bad.
 I
 mean,
 you
 needed


this
 news
 if
 you
 were
 a
 Google
 to


continue
 showing
 that
 your
 TPUs
 had
 a


lot
 of
 value.
 Google
 right
 there,
 255.


that
 one
 continues
 to
 be
 green
 after


hours.
 You
 know,
 Google
 lost
 250
 for
 a


couple
 weeks.
 So,
 the
 fact
 that
 every


day
 this
 week
 it's
 basically
 been


closing
 above
 250
 is
 also
 really
 nice


and
 bullish
 to
 see.


Uh
 Josh
 says,
 "My
 thoughts
 here
 on


Intel.
 They
 are
 the
 worst
 chip


manufacturer,
 worst
 chip
 manufacturer,


and
 they
 are
 doing
 this
 well.
 Just


imagine
 the
 others
 and
 what
 that
 means


for
 the
 space
 in
 general."
 That's
 a
 hell


of
 a
 point.
 If
 Intel,
 which
 quite


frankly
 has
 sucked
 for
 the
 past
 couple


of
 years,
 is
 beating
 EPS
 by
 20%.


I
 mean,
 I
 think
 we
 should
 be
 relatively


optimistic
 for
 Broadcom's
 earnings,
 for


AMD's
 earnings,
 for
 Nvidia's
 earnings,


even
 without
 China
 demand
 and
 Middle


East
 demand
 and
 all
 these
 other
 things


that
 they're
 still
 lacking.
 Intel
 now


4140.
 If
 Intel
 can
 put
 up
 these
 numbers,


the
 rest
 of
 these
 guys
 should
 really
 be


able
 to
 put
 up
 these
 numbers.
 And
 again,


we're
 seeing
 it.
 Anthropic's
 not
 going


to
 sign
 a
 massive
 deal
 with
 Google.
 If


Google
 doesn't
 have
 the
 cloud
 computing


capacity
 to
 provide
 them
 the
 workloads,


if
 Google
 doesn't
 have
 the
 chips
 needed


to
 make
 sure
 that
 they
 can
 say
 you
 can


sign
 a
 deal
 worth
 tens
 of
 billions
 of


dollars
 for
 us
 and
 if
 anthropic
 doesn't


have
 the
 demand
 like
 all
 these
 things


are
 intertwined.
 So
 the
 demand
 is
 there


from
 their
 side
 on
 the
 foundation
 model


and
 then
 Google
 is
 ready
 with
 the
 supply


and
 the
 infrastructure,
 the
 data


centers,
 the
 gigawatts
 of
 energy
 to
 make


it
 actually
 happen
 and
 as
 a
 result
 I


think
 you
 should
 get
 good
 earnings
 from


a
 lot
 of
 these
 hyperscalers
 that
 are


getting
 into
 these
 deals.


So
 there
 you
 go.
 Google
 continue
 to
 be


green


on
 the
 day.
 Intel
 as
 well
 continuing
 to


still
 hold
 up.
 And
 then
 Amcor


up
 after
 hours
 as
 well.
 S&P
 500
 up
 half


a
 percent.
 All right,
 we're
 going to
 go


to
 Karp.
 This
 is
 10
 minutes
 of
 Karp
 on


Fox
 today.
 Uh
 they
 signed
 a
 multiund


multi-year
 partnership
 with
 Lumen.
 Here


is
 what
 Karp
 had
 to
 say.
 This
 is
 his


first
 interview
 in
 a
 while.
 And
 uh
 this


is
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 the
 last


interview
 before
 we
 officially
 get
 Q3


earnings
 going
 into
 November.


>> CEO
 Alex
 Karp
 and
 he
 is
 here
 with
 Kate


Johnson,
 president
 and
 CEO
 of
 Lumen.


Palanteer
 and
 Lumen
 just
 announced
 an


expanded
 multi-year
 multi-million
 dollar


partnership
 to
 deploy
 Palunteer's
 AI
 to


fasttrack
 and
 enhance
 Lumen's
 digital


networking
 infrastructure.
 Kate,
 how'd


you
 get
 hooked
 up
 with
 this
 guy?
 Yeah,


well
 through
 an
 incredible
 partnership


actually.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 we're
 teaming
 up


to
 deliver
 the
 holy
 grail
 for


businesses.
 It's
 all
 about
 real
 time


intelligence.
 And
 you
 need
 two
 things
 to


do
 that.
 You
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 move


huge
 amounts
 of
 data
 from
 anywhere
 to


anywhere
 quickly,
 securely,


effortlessly.
 And
 that's
 what
 Lumen


does.
 That's
 our
 business.
 And
 you
 need


once
 you
 have
 that
 data,
 you
 need
 to
 be


able
 to
 make
 sense
 of
 it.
 And
 that's
 the


AI
 platform
 that
 Palunteer
 has.
 Alex,


uh,
 this
 is
 a
 reported
 $200
 million


deal.
 Am
 we
 am
 I
 right
 on
 that?


>> You
 know,
 we
 don't
 really
 comment
 on
 the


specifics
 of
 deals.
 What
 I
 would
 say
 is


um
 it
 is
 a
 formative
 deal
 for
 us.
 We
 are


very
 very
 happy
 to
 be
 partnered
 with


you.
 She
 I
 mean
 she's
 what
 basically
 is


happening
 is
 you
 have
 a
 business
 that
 if


it
 can
 be
 transformed
 in
 in
 a
 couple
 in


a
 in
 a
 year
 as
 opposed
 to
 5
 years
 could


be
 the
 backbone
 of
 essentially
 every
 AI


use
 case
 in
 the
 country.
 you
 have
 these


somewhat
 older
 uh
 telco
 infrastructures


that
 really
 can't
 support
 the
 burden


that
 AI
 places
 on
 on
 the
 network
 and
 in


her
 leadership
 they
 have
 a
 team
 that
 is


just
 extremely
 aggressive
 in
 how
 do
 you


transform
 this
 from
 A
 to
 B
 and
 there


obviously
 our
 products
 are
 quite
 useful.


So
 after
 you've
 transformed
 it,
 then
 you


have
 you
 know
 after
 you
 can
 use
 the
 data


in
 real
 time
 at
 scale
 given
 the
 ai
 load


that's
 going
 to
 come
 then
 the
 question


is
 what
 do
 you
 do
 with
 the
 data
 and
 then


we're
 ideally
 suited
 for
 that
 but


honestly
 it's
 also
 just
 a
 marvelous
 team


and
 we
 really
 enjoy
 supporting
 them.


>> Okay.
 So
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 give
 the


amount
 of
 money
 but
 is
 it
 fair
 to


quantify
 it
 as
 one
 of
 the
 bigger
 deals


you've
 done?


>> It's
 a
 very
 large
 deal
 and
 we're
 very


serious
 about
 it.
 What
 do
 you
 think


Palanteer
 can
 do
 for
 you
 and
 your


millions
 of
 miles?
 Right
 now,
 you
 expect


to
 do
 17
 million
 fiber
 miles
 by
 the
 end


of
 2025
 here
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Uh


what
 can
 Palunteer
 do?
 Because
 they're
 a


data
 aggregator.
 Explain
 to
 our
 audience


Yeah.
 what
 you
 expect
 this
 partnership


will
 enable
 you
 to
 do
 to
 speed
 up
 what


is
 now
 a
 very
 clogged
 system.
 Billions


of
 queries.
 Yeah.
 Is
 it
 fair
 to
 say
 per


hour?
 Per
 hour
 from
 AI.
 I
 would
 say
 per


seconds
 at
 this
 point.
 But
 I
 I
 think


there's
 a
 there's
 a
 couple
 things.
 So,


first
 of
 all,
 Lumen
 is
 uh
 customer
 zero


for
 the
 value
 of
 this
 partnership,


right?
 We
 use
 the
 Palunteer
 platform
 to


make
 sense
 of
 our
 data.
 Like
 so
 many


businesses
 out
 there,
 Liz,
 there
 are


thousands
 of
 applications
 with
 data


trapped
 in
 them.
 And
 the
 Palunteer


platform
 helped
 us
 set
 that
 data
 free


and
 then
 make
 sense
 of
 it
 so
 we
 could
 do


two
 things.
 number
 one
 take
 a
 bunch
 of


cost
 out
 of
 our
 business
 and
 number
 two


accelerate
 our
 transformation
 to
 bring


AI
 you
 know
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 and


so
 what
 does
 Palander
 Palanteer
 do
 for


Lumen
 it
 basically
 accelerates
 our


transformation
 and
 allows
 us
 to
 bring


the
 joint
 capabilities
 moving
 data


making
 sensitive
 data
 to
 thousands
 of


customers
 Alex
 your
 data
 helps
 companies


and
 governments
 save
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 and


cut
 costs
 because
 it
 makes
 connections


It
 analyzes
 the
 data
 and
 that's


something
 that
 takes
 a
 lot
 less
 time


using
 that.
 So
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


demand
 that's
 out
 there
 for
 that
 to


happen
 for
 the
 enterprise
 customers
 whom


you
 serve,
 how
 much
 quicker
 can
 you
 make


this
 data
 move?


>> Well,
 I
 mean
 it
 is
 a
 class
 this
 is
 a


great
 example
 of
 you
 have
 a
 you
 have
 you


you
 have
 essentially
 a
 fixed
 asset.
 If


that
 aspect
 was
 transformed
 into
 more


modern
 infrastructure,
 you
 could
 do
 it


200x
 faster.
 So
 that's
 two,
 but
 then


there's
 two
 points.
 It's
 both
 hundreds


of
 times
 faster,
 but
 then
 it's
 actually


incrementally
 cheaper
 because
 you
 could


orchestrate
 when
 do
 you
 use
 our
 product,


when
 do
 you
 not
 use
 it,
 at
 what
 cost


point,
 how
 much
 data
 would
 you
 use?
 And


it's
 both
 the
 fast
 it's
 faster
 and


cheaper.
 You
 could
 look
 at
 this,
 at


least
 I'm
 kind
 of
 a
 lay
 person,
 but
 you


could
 look
 at
 the
 business
 and
 say,
 why


isn't
 this
 much
 more
 like
 a
 cloud


business
 where
 you
 have,
 you
 know,
 you


take
 older
 infrastructure
 and
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 you
 can
 actually
 do
 uh
 near


realtime
 queries
 and
 you
 can
 control
 the


cost,
 which
 honestly
 many
 cloud


providers
 can't
 do
 very
 well.
 So,
 if
 you


could
 do
 both
 uh
 in
 real
 time,
 that


completely
 transforms
 not
 only
 the
 the


use
 cases
 you
 can
 do,
 but
 the
 cost
 of


the
 use
 case.
 And
 you
 know
 in
 in
 AI
 one


of
 the
 problems
 on
 the
 pure
 front
 end
 is


a
 lot
 of
 the
 use
 cases
 are
 are
 are
 the


value
 doesn't
 equate
 to
 the
 cost
 of


running
 them.
 So
 one
 of
 the
 big
 ways
 you


make
 these
 things
 more
 valuable
 is
 you


control
 the
 cost.
 And
 obviously
 in
 our


ontology
 we
 believe
 you
 can
 create
 a
 lot


more
 valuable
 a
 lot
 more
 valuable


quantifiable
 use
 cases.
 And
 if
 you
 can


do
 both
 you
 you'll
 do
 very
 very
 well
 in


the
 market


>> and
 securing
 this
 data
 hugely
 important.


The
 president
 right
 now
 is
 talking
 about


homeland
 security.
 So
 much
 of
 the
 data


and
 the
 the
 efforts
 that
 they
 do
 ties


back
 to
 you
 guys.
 You
 at
 Palunteer
 have


so
 many
 software
 deals
 with
 many
 arms
 of


the
 government
 including
 uh
 Homeland


Security.
 So
 securing
 that
 data.


>> Well,
 we
 both
 do.
 I
 mean
 the
 reality
 is


the
 partnership
 really
 began
 because
 we


both
 have
 very
 significant
 government


clients.
 Uh
 again,
 but
 again,
 these


clients
 care
 about
 speed,
 veracity,
 and


security
 and
 um
 and
 and
 and
 and
 and


that's
 essentially
 what
 they
 want
 to


buy.
 And
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 there
 there
 a


lot
 of
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 difficulty
 in
 in


doing
 this
 and
 using
 large
 language


models
 in
 the
 in
 the
 how
 do
 you
 when
 do


you
 use
 them?
 How
 do
 they
 touch
 your


infrastructure?
 Under
 what
 conditions,


what
 do
 they
 say?
 These
 these
 are
 going


to
 be
 crucial
 to
 making
 things
 actually


valuable.


>> How
 far
 behind
 are
 we,
 Kate,
 in
 building


out
 connections
 between
 cities?
 you've


got
 this
 inner
 city
 network
 between
 50


major
 centers
 in
 America,
 but
 I
 mean
 I'm


sure
 you
 guys
 you
 guys
 will
 push
 it
 much


as
 you
 can
 out
 there,
 but
 again,
 you're


talking
 about
 billions
 of
 queries
 and


now
 all
 of
 these
 enterprise
 companies


have
 agents,
 AI,
 agentics.
 There's
 a


there's
 a
 pretty
 big
 gap
 between
 what's


needed
 to
 thrive
 in
 the
 AI
 economy
 and


what
 we
 have
 today.
 But
 we're
 going
 very


very
 quickly
 and
 it's
 it's
 a
 couple
 of


quick
 things.
 Number
 one,
 the


hyperscalers
 recognized
 the
 gap
 last


year
 and
 we
 did
 a
 bunch
 of
 business
 with


them
 to
 interconnect
 all
 of
 their
 data


centers.
 We're
 underway
 with
 that


business
 right
 now
 digging
 trenches
 to


make
 sure
 that
 we
 we
 are
 building
 the
 AI


superighway.
 Um
 the
 second
 piece
 of
 it


is
 kind
 of
 this
 bandwidth
 reckoning
 that


businesses
 are
 having
 like
 oh
 my
 gosh
 I


need
 so
 much
 more
 than
 I
 have
 and
 the


pipes
 today
 they
 aren't
 secure
 enough


intelligent
 enough
 quick
 enough
 you
 know


big
 enough
 and
 we're
 fixing
 all
 of
 that


with
 the
 digital
 platform


>> and
 Alex
 the


>> by
 the
 way
 important
 to
 note
 also
 she


employs
 thousands
 and
 thousands
 and
 tens


of
 thousands
 of
 workers
 to
 actually
 do


this
 so
 it's
 also
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the


fascinating
 things
 about
 the
 business
 is


it's
 like
 supporting
 kind
 of
 high-end


use
 cases
 that
 people
 equate
 with
 AI


it's
 also
 supporting
 the
 American


worker.


>> Absolutely.


U
 and


this
 push
 towards
 super
 intelligence
 is


also
 sucking
 up
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 space


through
 the
 networking
 system.
 How
 close


are
 we,
 Alex,
 to
 super
 intelligence?
 And


I
 I
 asked
 that
 because
 a
 consortium
 of


heavy
 hitters,
 everyone
 from
 Steve


Waznjak
 to
 Sir
 Richard
 Branson
 to
 Prince


I
 don't
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 princes,
 Prince


Harry,
 uh
 the
 AI
 pri
 Nobel
 Prize
 winning


AI
 pioneer
 Jeffrey
 Hinton
 released
 a


statement
 calling
 for
 a
 moratorum
 on


developing
 the
 system.
 Hold
 on,
 let
 me


just
 let
 me
 put
 this
 out
 there.


Developing
 a
 system
 that
 could
 surpass


human
 cognition.


>> Okay.
 Well,
 now
 we're
 moving
 into
 the


portion
 that's
 just
 me
 and
 I
 don't
 like


I
 like
 to
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 but
 um
 the


there's
 basically
 the
 way
 they
 look
 at


it
 and
 the
 way
 I
 look
 at
 it
 which
 is
 my


view
 uh
 not
 not
 anyone
 else's
 which
 is


we're
 in
 a
 we're
 in
 a
 we're
 in
 an
 arms


race
 here.
 This
 is
 that's
 all
 academic


super
 academic.
 It's
 like
 we're
 going
 to


either
 have
 AI
 and
 and
 determine
 the


rules
 or
 our
 adversaries
 will
 have
 it


and
 they'll
 determine
 the
 rules.
 And
 it


and
 so
 this
 is
 why
 these
 infrastructure


things
 are
 crazy
 important
 because
 in


order
 to
 make
 it
 work,
 what
 do
 you
 need?


You
 need
 infrastructure
 that
 can


actually
 run
 the
 models,
 get
 the
 data


there
 in
 a
 secure
 and
 cheap
 enough
 way.


You
 need
 to
 make
 the
 models
 actually


useful.
 You
 need
 ontology
 to
 do
 that.


Meaning
 you
 have
 to
 deploy
 them
 where


they're
 useful
 and
 where
 they're
 not
 and


and
 orchestrate
 them.
 And
 if
 you
 start


putting
 impediments
 on
 this,
 de
 facto,


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 is
 our


adversaries
 will
 build
 it
 and
 we
 will
 be


buying
 everything
 from
 them,
 including


our
 ideas
 of
 how
 to
 run
 our
 country.
 And


so
 like
 my
 personal
 version,
 Palanteer,


what
 we
 represent
 at
 Palanteer,
 what
 we


do
 not
 impose
 on
 anyone
 else
 is
 we're


running.
 We're
 running
 like
 hell
 and


we're
 going
 to
 support
 anybody,


especially
 people
 on
 the
 front
 line
 who


can
 like
 galvanize
 this
 infrastructure


and
 then
 our
 clients
 in
 the
 DoD


especially
 and
 help
 make
 the
 American


war
 fighter
 the
 most
 lethal
 in
 the


world.


>> Jensen
 Wong
 of
 of
 Nvidia
 had
 said


similar
 to
 what
 you
 just
 said
 that
 if
 we


don't
 develop
 this
 stuff
 then
 and
 we


don't
 take
 the
 lead
 in
 the
 tech
 stack
 of


the
 world
 then
 we
 are
 going
 to
 lose
 it


to
 China.
 though
 he
 is
 for
 doing


business
 with
 China.
 You
 have
 never
 done


business
 with
 a
 Chinese
 government.


>> We
 all
 have
 our
 own
 position
 on
 this.


First
 of
 all,
 Jensen
 is
 a
 patriot
 and


someone
 that
 everyone
 in
 the
 business


community,
 including
 I
 respect
 and
 you


know,
 we
 all
 have
 differing
 opinions
 on


this
 and
 we
 could
 sit
 down
 and
 probably


discuss
 them.
 The
 the
 the
 where
 I'm
 sure


Jensen
 Wong
 and
 I
 agree
 is
 this
 is
 an


American
 dream.
 This
 is
 an
 American


technology.
 He
 is
 a
 pre-minent
 American


and
 with
 a
 pre-minent
 crucial
 American


company.
 We
 believe
 you
 need
 ontology


and
 uh
 and
 and
 chips
 to
 make
 this
 work.


We
 supply
 the
 ontology.
 It
 turns
 out
 you


also
 need
 infrastructure.
 There
 are


certain
 components
 you
 need
 to
 make
 this


work.
 They
 happen
 to
 be
 made
 in
 America


and
 we
 should
 just
 focus
 on
 making


America
 even
 stronger
 and
 stronger.


>> They're
 not
 doing
 business
 with
 China.


>> Well,
 Pal,
 we
 all
 make
 their
 own


decisions.
 Palanteer
 has
 a
 long
 long
 we


we
 also
 we
 started
 off
 in
 the
 military.


We
 support
 clandestine
 service.
 We're


very
 unique.
 We
 at
 Palanteer
 only
 work


with
 American
 allies.
 That's
 a
 decision.


By
 the
 way,
 it's
 not
 everyone's


decision.
 But
 what's
 crucial
 is,
 you


know,
 we
 get
 the
 American
 economy
 to
 be


by
 far
 the
 strongest
 in
 the
 world.
 And


and
 people
 like
 Jensen
 Wong
 and


Palanteer
 and
 Lumen
 were
 all
 marching
 in


that
 direction.


All
 right,
 that's
 what
 you
 got
 from
 Mr.


Alex
 Karp
 and
 Palenteer.


I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 I
 think
 I
 think
 200


after
 earnings
 is
 possible.
 So,
 they
 got


to
 put
 up
 some
 really
 good
 numbers.
 But,


I
 this
 is
 a
 pretty
 big
 deal
 that
 they


signed.
 If
 Bloomberg's
 correct
 and
 it's


200
 million,
 I
 mean
 200
 million
 bucks.


If
 they
 can
 get
 more
 and
 more
 deals
 like


that,
 you
 can
 just
 imagine
 the
 rapid


adoption
 of
 the
 commercial
 business,
 not


to
 mention
 the
 government
 business.


And
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 ultimately


figure
 out
 how
 these
 results
 play
 into


the
 broader
 thesis
 that
 the
 street
 has


on
 Pounder.
 The
 street
 is
 at least


starting
 to
 form
 on
 pounder.
 We
 got
 a


lot
 more
 price
 target
 upgrades,
 but
 it


does
 seem
 like
 the
 business
 continues
 to


execute
 at
 a
 pretty
 high
 level.
 Pounder


right
 there
 after
 hours
 180.47.
 Nvidia


that's
 still
 up
 1%,
 Tesla
 up
 1.96,
 and


then
 hoodie


at


134.
 I
 don't
 know
 much
 about
 Lumen.
 I


did
 interview
 one
 of
 their
 executives
 at


um
 AIPCON
 and
 uh
 I
 posted
 a
 video
 on


Daily
 Paler
 about
 it.
 I
 mean,
 look,


here's
 the
 thing.
 I
 don't
 think
 just


because
 a
 company
 works
 with
 Palanteer,


it's
 worth
 investing
 in
 them.
 Um
 because


like
 you
 know
 just
 because
 you
 use


Pounder
 doesn't
 mean
 you're
 a
 great


company.
 But
 it
 does
 give
 a
 little
 bit


more
 of
 a
 reassurance
 if
 you
 are


thinking
 of
 investing
 in
 a
 company


knowing
 that
 their
 software


infrastructure
 is
 built
 on
 something


that
 actually
 you
 know
 can
 scale
 manage


the
 data
 and
 properly
 give
 them
 the


types
 of
 intelligence
 they
 need
 to


actually
 advance
 the
 business
 forward.


Uh
 Lumen
 is
 up
 10x
 since
 the
 lows.
 It's


up
 38%
 year
 to
 date.
 Again,
 I
 just
 don't


know
 enough
 about
 this
 company,
 but


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 names
 that
 have
 done


very
 well
 as
 they've
 been
 able
 to
 use


more
 Palanteer.
 Now,
 what
 is
 the
 street


thinking
 for
 Palanteer
 going
 into


earnings?
 They
 have
 a
 revenue
 target
 of


um


let's
 put
 it
 right
 here.
 1.09
 billion


and
 they
 want
 about
 17
 cents
 of
 EPS.


I
 mean,
 I
 think
 we
 beat
 that.
 I
 think
 we


can
 beat
 I
 think
 we
 can
 do
 1.2.
 we
 could


beat
 it
 by
 about
 100
 million
 or
 at least


by
 50
 million.
 And
 so
 if
 we
 come
 in
 at


1.2,
 you're
 looking
 at
 53
 54%


year-over-year
 growth.
 That
 would
 be


pretty
 incredible.


Not
 easy
 for
 the
 broader
 stock
 market
 to


understand,
 you
 know,
 companies
 being


able
 to
 put
 up
 that
 type
 of
 growth,


especially
 in
 software.
 So
 I
 think


that's
 what
 we
 would
 be
 we'd
 be
 looking


for.
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 up
 1.13%
 and
 the


S&P
 500
 up
 6%
 on
 the
 day.
 We
 will
 have


the
 daily
 recap
 out
 later
 on
 the
 day.


Yesterday
 we
 missed
 it
 because
 we
 went


long
 with
 Tesla
 earnings,
 but
 we'll
 have


a
 normal
 daily
 recap
 out
 later
 today
 and


we'll
 recap
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 different
 stuff


that
 happened.
 Uh,
 going
 back
 to
 this


story,
 we
 got
 a
 couple
 other
 stories


that
 we'll
 talk
 about
 and
 then
 we'll
 be


done
 for
 the
 day.
 Trump
 is
 still
 taking


questions.
 It's
 mainly
 political
 stuff.


All
 the
 headlines
 I'm
 getting
 are
 pretty


much
 polit
 political
 questions.
 No
 one's


asked
 him
 about
 China.
 No
 one's
 asked


him
 about
 anything
 of
 that.
 So,
 not


really
 seeing
 any
 of
 those
 quotes
 here.


Here
 is
 the
 update
 from
 Regetti
 on
 this


Quantum
 story
 today.
 And
 this
 is
 what


they
 told
 CNBC
 based
 on
 if
 the


government
 is
 willing
 to
 take
 an
 equity


stake
 or
 not.


>> Hi
 Christina.


>> It's
 been
 a
 roller
 coaster
 with
 this


story,
 but
 like
 you
 said,
 the
 Trump


administration
 is
 really
 pouring
 cold


water
 on
 a
 report
 about
 quantum


computing
 deals.
 An
 administration


official
 tells
 CNBC
 Aman
 Jabers
 that


they're
 not
 currently
 negotiating
 equity


stakes
 in
 quantum
 firms,
 but
 stocks
 like


you
 said,
 INQ,
 D-Wave
 are
 still
 much


higher.
 INQ
 up
 four,
 D-Wave
 up
 almost


10%.
 The
 key
 words
 though
 are
 currently


and
 equity
 which
 suggests
 that
 there


could
 be
 a
 deal
 in
 the
 future,
 perhaps


one
 that
 would
 use
 warrants
 giving
 the


government
 the
 right
 to
 buy
 shares
 later


rather
 than
 taking
 ownership
 now.
 But


Regetti
 told
 CNBC
 this
 morning,
 quote,


"We
 are
 continuously
 engaging
 with
 the


US
 government
 on
 funding
 opportunities.


If
 the
 US
 does
 not
 lead
 in
 supporting


these
 breakthroughs,
 others
 will,
 posing


significant
 risks
 to
 our
 national


security.
 So,
 if
 a
 deal
 happens,
 it


would
 follow
 Intel.
 The
 government


converted
 grants
 into
 a
 10%
 stake
 just


earlier
 this
 year.
 But
 Intel
 has


billions
 of
 dollars
 in
 revenue.
 These


quantum
 firms
 have
 barely
 any
 and
 are


burning
 cash
 on
 tech
 that
 doesn't
 work


commercially
 just
 yet.
 Washington
 would


be
 essentially
 backing
 smaller
 startups,


while
 Google,
 IBM,
 Microsoft,
 Amazon


spend
 billions
 on
 quantum.
 Google
 just


said
 uh
 recently
 in
 the
 24
 hours
 that


its
 willow
 chip
 ran
 an
 algorithm
 13,000


times
 faster
 than
 a
 supercomput.
 This
 is


really
 just
 a
 global
 race
 for
 quantum


dominance.
 Australia
 putting
 nearly
 a


billion
 dollars
 in
 Sai
 Quantum.
 The
 US


sees
 quantum
 as
 critical
 to
 staying


ahead,
 especially
 ahead
 of
 China.


Correct,


>> Christina.
 So,
 you
 started
 off
 talking


about
 sort
 of
 the
 volatility
 of
 these


names
 today
 along
 with
 the
 announcements


that
 we've
 heard,
 but
 to
 your
 point,


they're
 they're
 still
 higher.
 Why?


>> It
 speaks
 to
 the
 speculation
 of
 um
 of


these
 names
 and
 how
 they
 can
 be
 almost


categorized
 in
 the
 the
 meme
 box.
 I
 was


going
 to
 say
 right
 anything
 with
 quantum


it
 seems
 like
 investor
 is
 is
 there
 a
 big


retail
 trade
 in
 these
 names?


>> Oh
 of
 course
 there
 is
 but
 I
 don't
 want


to
 discount
 the
 the
 scientific


breakthroughs
 from
 a
 lot
 of
 these


companies
 and
 they
 are
 doing
 some
 they


are
 producing
 something
 you
 know
 versus


maybe
 some
 of
 the
 other
 meme
 names
 or


you're
 wondering
 they're
 just
 completely


negative
 in
 terms
 of
 revenue.
 They
 uh


what
 is
 their
 product
 even
 but
 in
 this


case
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 names
 they
 move


quite
 in
 tandem
 with
 any
 speck
 of


headline
 and
 we
 saw
 that
 early
 today
 in


the
 White
 House
 pouring
 cold
 water.
 The


other
 thing
 too
 is
 that
 the
 White
 House


said
 currently
 an
 equity
 stake
 which


could
 imply
 that
 maybe
 there's
 some


other
 Yeah.
 or
 or
 a
 complete
 other
 deal.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 that
 are
 in


talks
 with
 the
 US
 government
 right
 now


because
 the
 US
 government
 has
 shifted


their
 stance
 in
 how
 they
 deal
 with


business
 MP
 materials
 intel.
 Uh
 you
 know


>> it's
 a
 good
 point
 that
 she's
 making


right.
 So
 first
 of
 all
 the
 US
 government


said
 currently
 they
 should
 have
 said
 the


other
 two
 words
 after
 that.
 That
 would


have
 that,
 you
 know,
 I
 actually
 heard


Damn,
 I'm
 forgetting
 where
 I
 heard


someone
 I
 was
 listening
 to
 something


yesterday
 and
 someone
 said
 currently


right
 now.
 Oh
 man,
 I
 got
 I
 got
 to
 try
 to


remember
 what
 it
 was.
 It
 was
 some


YouTube
 video
 and
 someone
 said
 it.
 I


think
 I
 was
 in
 the
 car
 and
 it
 was


hilarious
 listening
 to
 it.
 Damn,
 I
 wish


I
 had
 saved
 it.
 I
 forgot
 what
 it
 was.


But
 uh
 yeah,
 I
 wish
 they
 said
 it
 right


now.
 But
 look,
 it's
 currently
 so
 that


means
 they
 could
 be
 thinking
 of
 an


equity
 stake
 in
 the
 future.
 Also,
 they


could
 be
 discussing
 buying
 warrants,


which
 means
 they
 don't
 have
 to
 buy
 the


equity
 stake
 right
 now.
 They
 could
 have


the
 right
 to
 buy
 an
 equity
 uh
 in
 these


companies
 in
 the
 future.
 The
 other
 thing


that's
 important
 about
 this
 is
 again
 and


and
 I
 you
 know
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 a


pretty
 reasonable
 stance
 that
 that
 a
 lot


of
 people
 would
 agree
 with.
 I
 don't


think
 anyone's
 necessarily
 denying
 the


science
 of
 quantum.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


different
 academic
 disagreements
 about


it.
 You
 could
 say
 uh
 but
 you
 know
 when


Google
 and
 Microsoft
 and
 Jensen
 and
 Elon


and
 all
 these
 people
 think
 that
 there's


some
 potential
 here.
 You're
 not
 denying


the
 science
 of
 it.
 The
 question
 is
 the


valuations
 of
 these
 companies
 that
 do
 12


million
 in
 revenue
 and
 have
 a
 $15


billion
 market
 cap.
 So
 the
 question
 then


becomes
 does
 the
 US
 invest
 in
 Google
 if


they
 care
 so
 much
 about
 quantum
 national


security
 and
 the
 race
 against
 China


because
 Google
 as
 we
 can
 see
 from
 what


Sundor
 said
 yesterday
 is
 making
 some


pretty
 big
 progress
 on
 it
 or
 do
 they


invest
 in
 Regetti
 or
 IONQ
 by
 the
 way
 and


Q
 has
 three
 billion
 in
 cash.
 So,
 so
 it


begs
 the
 question,
 why
 do
 they
 need
 any


money
 from
 the
 US,
 right?
 I
 think
 those


are
 the
 broader
 questions.
 Not


necessarily
 is
 quantum
 real
 or
 not,
 but


do
 these
 companies
 deserve
 that
 type
 of


investment?
 And
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 what


the
 Trump
 administration
 continues
 to
 do


over
 the
 long
 term
 with
 uh
 with
 these


equity
 stakes.
 Uh
 Google
 after
 hours


still
 moving.
 Where's
 Intel?
 Google
 not


moving
 as
 much
 as
 it
 was
 a
 couple
 days


ago
 on
 the
 rumor.
 Now,
 they
 got
 the


confirmation
 with
 Anthropic,
 but


relatively
 flat
 from
 a
 couple
 days
 ago.


Intel
 41.
 Intel
 still
 moving
 at
 41


and
 not
 really
 getting
 hit
 after
 hours.


She
 said
 currently
 right.
 So
 she
 got


halfway
 there.
 Dude,
 what
 was
 the
 video


I
 was
 watching?


What
 was
 the
 video
 I
 was?
 There
 was
 some


video
 I
 was
 watching
 yesterday
 that
 said


currently
 right
 now.


And
 it
 was
 fantastic.
 It
 was
 absolutely


freaking
 fantastic.


All
 right.
 So,
 we
 got
 a
 couple
 other


headlines
 that
 we'll
 get
 to.
 First,


let's
 uh
 let's
 go
 to
 Trump
 and
 let's
 see


if
 there's
 any
 other
 questions
 we're


getting.
 Um


well,
 okay.
 So,
 this
 is
 not
 macro
 stuff,


but
 we
 do
 have
 uh
 his
 thoughts
 on
 the


shutdown.
 So,
 let's
 take
 a
 listen
 to


that
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from


there.


>> I
 think
 the
 Democrats
 have
 gone
 totally


crazy
 and
 you
 don't
 know
 what
 they're


going
 to
 do
 because
 they
 don't
 care


about
 the
 people.
 They
 don't
 I
 I
 really


think
 they
 have
 no
 leadership.
 They
 have


a
 lot
 of
 very
 low
 IQ
 people.
 Jasmine


Crockett
 is
 a
 low
 IQ
 person.
 A
 lot
 of


them
 are.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 insult
 too


many
 of
 them,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 are.


They
 have
 no
 They
 have
 no
 ru.
 I
 don't


think
 they
 know
 what
 they're
 doing
 right


now.
 You
 know,
 they've
 never
 done
 this


before.
 They
 always
 agreed
 to
 go
 and,


you
 know,
 called
 an
 extension.
 Let's
 do


an
 extension
 and
 talk.
 Uh
 even
 today,


look
 at
 what
 happened
 today.
 They


wouldn't
 even
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 pay
 the


people
 that
 have
 worked.
 And
 you
 know,


this
 was
 supposed
 to
 be
 sort
 of
 this
 was


a
 test
 and
 they
 wouldn't
 pay
 the
 people


that
 have
 been
 working.
 They
 said,
 "No,


no,
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 pay
 them."
 This
 is


all
 the
 Democrats.
 Now,
 all
 we
 need
 is


five
 Democrats.
 And
 I
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of


Democrats
 that
 are
 saying
 they're
 more


than
 five.
 Not
 probably
 not
 that
 many


more
 than
 five,
 but
 there
 are
 more
 than


five.
 And
 all
 we
 need
 is
 like
 five


Democrat
 votes.
 So,
 we're
 we
 open
 our


country
 again.
 Sad
 though,
 we
 have
 the


greatest
 economy
 in
 our
 history.
 We
 have


the
 highest
 stock
 market.
 All
 these


things
 are
 rocking.
 We
 have
 we
 will
 have


by
 the
 end
 of
 my
 first
 year
 more
 than
 20


trillion
 dollars
 of
 investment.
 The


all-time
 record
 is
 three
 three
 trillion.


I
 think
 it's
 China.
 We're
 going
 to
 have


20
 or
 21
 trillion.
 We've
 never
 had


anything
 like
 it
 coming
 in
 because
 of


tariffs.
 The
 money
 pouring
 into
 our


country,
 the
 plants
 that
 are
 opening,


AI,
 automos,
 everything.
 And
 the


Democrats
 want
 to
 close
 our
 country.


They're
 really,
 you
 know,
 they
 say


deranged.
 They
 are
 they
 suffer
 I
 guess


it's
 Trump
 derangement
 syndrome
 which
 I


think
 is
 going
 down
 now
 as
 an
 official


condition
 by
 the
 doctors.
 I
 think
 they


get
 paid
 extra
 money
 if
 they
 handle
 it


because
 it's
 more
 difficult
 to
 handle


than
 a
 normal
 mental
 disease.
 But
 but


you
 know what
 uh
 they
 they
 really


should
 approve
 an
 extension.
 Get
 the


country
 back
 to
 work.
 Get
 the
 people


paid.
 And
 you
 know
 it's
 very
 simple.
 You


can't
 you
 just
 don't
 know
 what's
 going


on.
 There's
 something
 wrong
 with
 them.


Yeah.
 Sad,
 actually.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 the
 uh
 back
 and
 forth


between
 Democrats
 and
 Republicans


continues
 to
 happen.
 Bernie
 Sanders
 had


some
 comments
 today.
 This
 was
 what
 he


said.
 I
 don't know
 if
 it's
 accurate
 or


not,
 but
 Bernie
 Sanders
 said
 that
 if
 the


Republicans
 got
 away
 with
 their
 plan
 and


we
 reopen
 the
 government,
 15
 million


people
 will
 lose
 their
 healthcare
 and


that
 would
 result
 to
 in
 in
 50,000
 people


dying
 every
 single
 year
 in
 this
 country.


So,
 when
 the
 host
 asked
 him
 why
 not
 just


like
 come
 to
 an
 agreement
 and
 and
 and


reopen
 the
 the
 country,
 he
 said
 uh
 he


can't
 live
 with
 that
 on
 his
 mind
 knowing


that
 50,000
 people
 would
 die


if
 they
 if
 they
 you
 know
 came
 to
 an


agreement.
 So,
 and
 and
 the
 reason
 I'm


saying
 this
 is
 because
 when
 you
 have
 a


senator
 saying,
 "Hey,
 there
 is
 no
 way
 in


hell
 I
 will
 agree
 to
 any
 deal
 because
 I


don't
 want
 50,000
 people
 to
 die
 based
 on


whatever
 study
 that
 Bernie
 is
 citing


that
 said
 50,000
 people
 will
 die
 if
 they


sign
 this
 deal."
 I
 mean,
 where's
 the


agreement
 going
 to
 be?
 And
 then
 here's


another
 stat
 for
 you
 that
 I
 read
 today


that
 was
 pretty
 interesting.
 Every
 time


we've
 had
 a
 shutdown
 negotiation,
 a
 lot


of
 it
 has
 coincided,
 I
 think
 like
 the


last
 nine
 out
 of
 10
 times
 have
 coincided


with
 raising
 the
 debt
 ceiling.
 And
 if
 we


don't
 raise
 the
 debt
 ceiling,
 we
 have
 a


lot
 of
 issues
 like
 that.
 That's
 a
 whole


different
 rabbit
 hole.
 So,
 usually


everyone
 comes
 together
 and
 says,
 "All


right,
 let's
 raise
 the
 debt
 ceiling."


This
 time,
 we
 don't
 have
 that
 happening.


It's
 a
 pretty
 different
 type
 of


shutdown.
 We
 don't
 have
 a
 debt
 ceiling


deadline
 coming
 up
 like
 anytime
 soon.


And
 because
 of
 that,
 one
 could
 argue


that
 the
 extension
 of
 the
 shutdown
 could


be,
 quite
 frankly,
 way
 longer
 than


expected
 because
 there's
 not
 that


massive
 incentive.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 economists
 that
 say
 if
 you
 don't


raise
 the
 debt
 ceiling
 and,
 you
 know,


things
 get
 too
 out
 of
 hand,
 you
 can
 get


into
 a
 great
 depression.
 That
 type
 of


pressure
 is
 not
 necessarily
 there,
 which


means
 this
 might
 last
 longer
 than


expected.
 This
 might
 last
 a
 lot
 longer


than
 expected,
 and
 we're
 going to
 have


to
 see


ultimately
 how
 long
 that
 plays
 out.
 Uh,


another
 update
 in
 the
 crypto
 world
 from


Trump
 is
 that
 he
 did
 pardon
 CZ,
 which
 is


the
 founder
 of
 uh,
 Binance.
 Ironically,


Robin
 Hood
 listed
 the
 token
 today,
 BNB,


which
 is
 the
 Binance
 token
 on
 their


platform.
 They
 also
 listed
 Hype.
 Uh,
 two


very,
 very
 liquid
 cryptocurrencies.
 So,


both
 of
 those
 coming
 to
 Robin
 Hood,
 is


bullish
 for
 Hood.
 But,
 uh,
 Trump


pardoned
 him
 and
 here
 is
 what
 Trump
 had


to
 say
 about
 the
 pardon.


>> People
 say
 that,
 are
 you
 talking
 about


the
 crypto
 person?
 Uh,
 a
 lot
 of
 people


say
 that
 he
 wasn't
 guilty
 of
 anything.


He
 served
 four
 months
 in
 jail
 and
 they


say
 that
 uh
 he
 was
 not
 guilty
 of


anything.
 that
 what
 he
 did.
 Well,
 you


don't
 know
 much
 about
 crypto.
 You
 know


nothing
 about
 you
 know
 nothing
 about


nothing.
 You
 fake
 news.
 But
 let
 me
 just


tell
 you
 that
 he
 was
 uh
 somebody
 that
 as


I
 was
 told
 I
 don't
 know
 him.
 I
 don't


believe
 I've
 ever
 met
 him.
 But
 uh
 I've


been
 told
 by
 a
 lot
 of
 support.
 He
 had
 a


lot
 of
 support
 and
 they
 said
 that
 what


he
 did
 is
 not
 even
 a
 crime.
 It
 wasn't
 a


crime
 that
 he
 was
 persecuted
 by
 the


Biden
 administration.


Uh
 and
 so
 I
 gave
 him
 a
 partner
 at
 the


request
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 very
 good
 people.


>> So
 there
 you
 go.
 Uh
 that
 is
 why
 Mr.
 CZ


got
 the
 pardon.
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 why
 CZ


went
 to
 jail.
 Like
 I
 I
 I
 was
 I
 wasn't


that
 deep
 into
 crypto
 during
 the
 time.


So
 I'd
 have
 to
 do
 some
 more
 research
 on


what
 exactly
 happened.
 You
 did
 have
 some


crypto
 people
 that
 were
 pissed
 off


because
 he's
 not
 even
 American.
 And


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 Americans
 in
 the
 crypto


world
 that
 haven't
 been
 pardoned
 for


things
 they
 did
 that
 was
 in
 their


opinion
 a
 lot
 worse
 than
 what
 CZ
 did.
 I


I
 still
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 exactly
 the


guy
 did
 a
 couple
 years
 ago.
 Uh
 so
 you


had
 some
 people
 pissed
 off,
 but
 you
 have


a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 love
 CZ.
 I
 mean
 the


guy's
 estimated
 to
 be
 worth
 over
 $50


billion.
 He's
 built
 one
 of the
 biggest


platforms
 in
 the
 world
 with
 Binance.
 So


did
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 crypto
 folks
 that
 were


that
 were
 happy
 that
 that
 happened.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 they're
 going
 to
 actually


pardon
 SBF.
 I
 think
 the
 political


backlash
 because
 because
 you
 have
 a
 lot


of
 crypto
 people
 that
 hate
 SPF
 because


they
 think
 he
 represents
 the
 worst
 of


the
 industry.
 And
 so
 I
 mean
 look,
 Trump


is
 very
 close
 with
 SPF's
 parents
 and


that
 was
 reported
 from
 Bloomberg
 back
 in


early
 2024
 when
 Trump
 was
 running
 for


the
 second
 term.
 So
 I
 could
 absolutely


see
 that
 happen.
 I
 mean,
 you
 could
 you


could
 easily
 see
 connections
 get


together
 and
 get
 Trump
 to
 unpardon
 him


or
 pardon
 him.
 The
 problem
 is
 like
 SPF


lost
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 I


think
 the
 political
 capital
 that
 would


that
 Trump
 would
 take
 would
 not
 be
 the


best
 thing
 in
 the
 world.
 Ed
 says
 CZ
 is
 a


real
 one.
 He
 did
 hard
 time
 for
 Bitcoin.


Yeah,
 see
 a
 lot
 a
 lot
 of the
 Bitcoin


maxis
 think
 that
 CZ
 took
 one
 for
 the


team
 for
 Bitcoin.
 You
 know,
 I
 have
 zero


idea,
 you
 know,
 his
 past
 or
 his
 history,


but
 there
 are
 some
 pretty
 important


people
 in
 crypto


that
 do
 uh
 do
 respect
 and
 love
 him.


Couple
 other
 updates.
 So,
 we
 got
 some


other
 headlines.
 First
 of
 all,
 shout
 out


to
 our
 friend
 Mr.
 TJ
 the
 Wheel
 Deal.


Finally
 getting
 a
 response
 from
 Anthony


Notto.
 TJ's
 been
 freaking
 posting
 about


SoFi
 for
 four
 years
 now.
 I
 think
 this
 is


the
 first
 time
 not
 the
 first
 or
 second


time
 has
 reposted
 him
 um
 or
 responded
 to


him.
 But
 TJ
 said
 it's
 easy
 to
 sell
 calls


and
 puts
 on
 SoFi.
 We
 know
 TJ
 is
 a
 big


option
 seller.
 Um,
 and
 there
 he
 is


selling
 some
 $35
 calls
 for
 November
 31st


or
 21st
 on
 on
 SoFi.


I
 have
 not
 updated
 the
 app
 to
 like
 sell


options
 on
 it,
 but
 for
 those
 that
 have,


I
 would
 I
 would
 love
 to
 know
 what
 your


experience
 has
 been
 because
 obviously


SoFi
 has,
 you
 know,
 started
 to
 roll
 this


out
 and
 hopefully
 that
 increases
 the


value
 of
 the
 invest
 platform.
 Intel


right
 there
 4114


that's
 up
 11%


after
 hours
 still.


Yeah,
 the
 first
 time.
 time.
 No
 noticed.


Exactly.


You
 guys
 really
 want
 to
 listen
 to
 the


intel
 call?
 Do
 we
 really
 care
 that
 much


about
 it?


Like,
 do
 we
 really
 does
 I
 mean,
 what
 are


they
 going
 to
 say?


Like,


I
 don't
 feel
 like
 the
 intel
 call
 is


going
 to
 be
 that
 exciting
 to
 be
 honest.


Okay,
 I'm
 seeing
 way
 more
 nos
 than


yeses.
 Okay,
 we
 can
 do
 a
 poll,
 but
 I
 do


guys,
 come
 on.
 Intel.
 Like
 this
 is
 not


Google
 or
 Amazon.
 Like
 yeah,
 they
 had
 a


good
 quarter,
 but
 like
 I'm
 telling
 you


all
 the
 people
 that
 are
 saying
 yes,


you're
 gonna
 be
 bored.
 Like
 just


straight
 if
 the
 Tesla
 call
 was
 boring,


trust
 me,
 the
 Intel
 call
 is
 not
 going
 to


be
 that
 much
 fun.
 You're
 not
 gonna
 robot


armies
 on
 this
 call.
 By
 the
 way,
 38%
 of


you
 guys
 said
 both.
 30%
 said
 AI
 for


target
 layoffs.
 32%
 said
 demand.
 So


decent
 amount
 of
 people
 saying
 it's


demand
 as
 well.


Okay.
 Listen
 to
 Intel
 call.
 Yes
 or
 no?


>> Dude,
 I've
 I've
 I've
 taken
 a
 chance
 on


all
 these
 companies
 that
 you
 got.
 I
 I've


been
 doing
 this
 for
 two
 years,
 okay?


I've
 done
 the
 Oh,
 Mick,
 can
 we
 please


listen
 to
 Airbnb
 and
 I'm
 like,
 well,


Airbnb,
 that's
 an
 important
 company.


I've
 been
 to
 Airb.
 The
 stock's
 been
 dog


[ __ ]
 for
 the
 past,
 but
 I've
 used
 Airbnbs


like,
 you
 know,
 at
 least
 20,
 30
 times.


Sure,
 let's
 listen
 to
 Air.
 Then
 we
 get


on
 the
 call.
 I'm
 like,
 well,
 now
 I
 know


why
 the
 stock's
 in
 the
 gutter.
 There
 is


nothing
 interesting
 to
 listen
 to
 when


Brian
 Chesy
 talks
 about
 Airbnb.
 It's
 a


freaking
 hotel
 for
 strangers.
 What
 is


exciting
 about
 that?
 Nothing.


We
 did
 that
 for
 SMCI.
 Boring.
 I
 We
 did


that
 for
 Intel
 two
 quarters
 ago.
 I
 don't


know
 what
 I
 was
 listening
 to.
 I
 mean,


not
 every
 call
 is
 a
 Hood
 or
 Pounder
 type


of
 call
 or
 a
 Jensen
 type
 of
 call.


There's
 just
 not
 much
 to
 listen
 to
 on


some
 of
 these
 calls
 right
 here.


What
 did
 you
 guys
 say?
 What
 did
 you
 say?


72%
 say
 no.
 All
 right,
 we
 got
 to
 go
 now.


If
 you
 look
 up
 Intel
 Call
 Live,
 though,


I'm
 sure
 there's
 a
 channel
 that's


streaming
 it.
 Let's
 see.
 Intel
 call.


Yeah,
 Benzinga
 is
 streaming
 it.
 I'll


link
 it
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat
 for
 those


that
 want
 to
 listen
 to
 it.
 Benzingo
 is


streaming
 it,
 so
 you
 can
 listen
 to
 it
 on


Benzinga's
 channel.


Yeah,
 Amcor's
 probably
 dude,
 we're
 not


going
 to
 listen
 to
 Amcor's
 call.
 Like,


yeah,
 I
 I
 own
 the
 stock,
 but
 I
 don't


want
 to
 listen
 to
 their
 call
 live.
 Like,


I'll
 listen
 to
 it
 on
 my
 own
 time,
 but


it's
 going
 to
 be
 boring,
 bro.
 It's
 like


it's
 a
 semiconductor
 company.
 It's
 not


going
 to
 be
 the
 most
 exciting
 call
 in


the
 world.
 Now,
 SoFi,
 that's
 going
 to
 be


a
 big
 one.
 That
 one
 we
 got
 to
 listen
 to,


but
 that'll
 be
 on
 Tuesday
 in
 the
 uh
 in


the
 morning.
 So,
 my
 SoFi
 is
 on
 Tuesday,


right?
 28th.


Yeah,
 Sofi's
 28th.
 Okay,
 cool.
 So,
 my


birthday
 is
 the
 27th
 and
 then
 SoFi
 is


the
 28th
 and
 then
 the
 week
 after
 that
 we


have
 Pounder
 Hood,
 Grab,


and
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 tech
 companies.
 And


next
 week,
 I
 think
 we
 have
 Google.
 And


the
 week
 after
 that
 we
 have


Meta,
 Microsoft,
 etc.


Philip
 says,
 "Well,
 now
 I'm
 invested


because
 of
 Trump."
 Well,
 there
 you
 go.


SoFi
 is
 at
 7:30.
 I'll
 be
 live
 at
 like


7:25.
 The
 call
 will
 start
 probably
 at
 8


a.m.


Yeah,
 we
 can
 listen
 to
 Apple.
 Usually


Apple
 and
 Amazon
 happen
 at
 the
 same


time,
 so
 we
 try
 to
 switch
 between
 both.


But
 Apple's
 call
 is
 also
 pretty
 boring.


Amazon
 is
 Amazon's
 also
 pretty
 boring,


dude.
 It's
 like
 it's
 but
 like
 obviously


because
 they're
 such
 important


companies,
 you
 kind
 of
 got
 to
 listen
 to


them.
 But


I
 feel
 like
 out
 of the
 Max
 7,
 Zucks
 does


the
 best
 job
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 keeping


you
 engaged.
 And
 then
 probably
 Jensen


and
 Sundar


and
 Nadella
 does
 good
 too,
 but
 like


those
 are
 some
 of
 the
 big
 ones
 that
 are


that
 are
 there.


Here's
 an
 idea
 I
 have
 for
 my
 birthday


because
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 asking,
 can


we
 do
 a
 birthday
 stream?
 I
 think
 I
 have


an
 idea.
 Let
 me
 know
 what
 you
 guys
 think


of
 it.
 I
 was
 thinking
 of
 it
 the
 other


day.
 Uh
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 the
 market


open,
 market
 close
 anyway
 on
 my
 birthday


because
 it's
 a
 Monday.
 So
 we'll
 be
 we'll


be
 doing
 that
 as
 usual.
 I
 was
 thinking


for
 the
 market
 close
 so
 towards
 the
 end


of
 the
 stream.
 Uh
 like
 a
 little
 fun


thing
 we
 can
 do.
 First
 of
 all,
 we're


going
 to
 be
 doing
 a
 giveaway
 on
 my


birthday
 because
 in
 Indian
 culture,
 you


know,
 when
 it's
 your
 birthday,
 you
 give


more
 than
 you
 take.
 So
 we're
 going
 to
 be


doing
 a
 giveaway
 and
 we'll
 we'll
 do


something
 fun
 on
 that.
 But
 I
 drinking


game.
 We
 should
 you
 know
 we
 it's
 a


Monday
 though,
 bro.
 If
 it
 was
 a


Saturday,
 yes,
 it's
 a
 freaking
 Monday.


We
 can't
 do
 it.
 I
 think
 what
 we
 can
 do


is
 we
 can
 uh
 I
 was
 thinking
 of
 this.
 I
 I


can
 compile
 some
 pictures
 from
 the
 past


28
 years
 of
 my
 life
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 you


guys
 have
 never
 seen.
 Pictures
 from
 when


I
 was
 five
 and
 seven,
 when
 I
 was
 in
 high


school,
 all
 this
 stuff.
 And
 we
 can
 do
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 a
 photo
 album
 and
 we
 can


go
 through
 some
 of
 the
 pictures.
 I
 feel


like
 that
 would
 be
 fun
 because
 there
 are


some
 there
 are
 some
 pretty
 fun
 moments


over
 the
 past
 28
 years.
 And
 uh
 you
 know


it's
 it's
 definitely
 going
 to
 be
 me


putting
 myself
 through
 embarrassment


because
 your
 boy
 did
 not
 know
 how
 to


dress
 in
 high
 school.
 Your
 boy
 still


doesn't
 know
 how
 to
 dress.
 But
 I
 didn't


know
 how
 to
 dress
 in
 high
 school.
 But
 I


thought
 I
 knew
 how
 to
 dress.
 So
 I
 was
 I


was
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 I
 I
 was
 on


Facebook
 the
 other
 day.
 Like
 I
 never
 go


on
 Facebook
 and
 I
 just
 started
 scrolling


from
 like
 years
 and
 years
 ago
 and
 I
 was


like
 dude
 did
 I
 actually
 wear
 that?


Like,
 did
 I
 actually
 leave
 the
 house
 and


go
 to
 school
 wearing
 that
 [ __ ]
 Like,


when
 you
 see
 these
 pictures,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 intense.


So,
 I
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 why
 don't
 why


don't
 we
 uh
 make
 it
 a
 little
 fun?"
 So,
 I


think
 we
 could
 do
 that.
 Yeah.
 Now,
 10


years
 later,
 it's
 hoodies
 under
 a


jersey.
 But
 back
 then,
 bro,
 back
 then


I
 I
 was
 just
 looking
 at
 some
 of
 these


pictures.
 I
 think
 someone
 sent
 me
 a


message
 on
 Facebook
 and
 so
 I
 clicked
 it


and
 then
 I
 just
 was
 like
 on
 the
 website


and
 then
 I
 just
 like
 went
 on
 my
 profile


like
 dude
 I
 haven't
 touched
 this
 profile


in
 years
 and
 then
 I'm
 looking
 at
 just


all
 these
 pictures
 I'm
 like
 you
 know
 it


would
 be
 kind
 of
 fun
 to
 just
 like


compile
 some
 old
 pictures
 together.


So
 maybe
 we
 can
 do
 that
 for
 the


birthday.


He's
 telling
 us
 that
 he
 doesn't
 know
 how


to
 dress
 like
 we
 didn't
 see
 him
 wear
 a


jersey
 over
 his
 hoodie.
 I
 still
 defend


the
 jersey
 over
 the
 hoodie.
 I
 really


think
 people
 just
 don't
 understand
 the


the
 sort
 of
 u
 the
 sort
 of
 what
 do
 they


call
 it
 in
 in
 in
 Paris?
 The
 chic.
 Isn't


that
 a
 Paris
 term?
 Chic
 fashion
 term.


Like
 you
 you
 don't
 understand
 the
 chic


of
 it.
 In
 fashion,
 chic
 refers
 to
 an


elegant,
 sophisticated,
 and
 timeless


style
 that
 emphasizes
 quality,
 a
 good


fit,
 and
 refined
 details
 over
 fleeting


trends.
 Yeah.
 I
 don't
 I
 just
 think


people
 didn't
 get
 that
 to
 be
 honest.


>> And
 that's
 why
 no
 one
 understood.


So
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 Hokei
 says,
 "I


sold
 all
 my
 Iran,
 made
 300%
 and
 bought


more
 Nebius."
 Dude,
 Nebius,
 I'm


definitely
 not
 getting
 my
 98
 put


assigned
 unless
 something
 changes


tomorrow.
 10720.


Maybe.
 Maybe
 95
 is
 the
 base.


Maybe
 95
 is
 the
 base
 on
 Nebus.


If
 you
 wore
 that
 outside
 the
 L,
 it
 would


have
 scared
 the
 thieves
 away.
 Oh
 my


goodness,
 bro.


What
 outfit
 do
 I
 wear
 on
 my
 birthday?


That's
 the
 next
 question.
 What
 do
 I
 wear


on
 the
 27th,
 bro?


Dude,
 I
 almost
 bet
 on
 the
 on
 the
 Knicks


last
 It
 was
 five
 minutes
 left.
 The


Knicks
 were
 up
 by
 seven.
 I
 almost
 deged.


Dude,
 I
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 even
 going
 to


say
 how
 much
 money
 I
 almost
 bet
 on
 the


Knicks
 last
 night.
 They
 were
 up
 by


seven.
 There
 were
 five
 minutes
 left.
 I


had
 my
 finger
 ready
 to
 swipe
 up.
 It
 was


a
 stupid
 amount
 of
 money.
 I
 was
 like,


"Well,
 if
 I'm
 right,
 if
 the
 Knicks
 just


don't
 mess
 up
 for
 the
 next
 five
 minutes,


I'm
 going
 to
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 money."


But
 then
 I
 was
 like,
 "If
 they
 do,
 this


would
 be
 the
 dumbest
 way
 to
 lose
 this


money."
 So,
 I
 just
 put
 my
 phone.
 I
 was


like, "Let
 me
 not
 do
 this.
 Let
 me
 just


let
 me
 not
 be
 an
 idiot
 right
 here."
 And


then
 Knicks
 ended
 up
 winning
 and
 I
 was


like, "Man,
 I
 should
 have
 taken
 that


bet."
 But
 then
 again,
 that's
 how


gambling
 addictions
 start,
 right?
 Like


you
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 win
 and
 then


you
 don't.
 Then
 you
 have
 to
 gamble
 to


win
 it
 back.
 So,
 I
 was
 just
 like, "Let


me
 just
 not
 let
 me
 not
 do
 that."
 They're


up
 by
 seven
 with
 five
 minutes
 left,
 bro.


But
 five
 minutes
 in
 the
 NBA
 is
 actually


a
 long
 amount
 of
 time.
 So
 that
 it's
 not


it's
 not
 a
 small
 amount
 of
 time
 for


people
 to
 make
 a
 comeback.


But
 yeah,
 I
 didn't
 do
 it.


That's
 how
 I
 feel
 every
 day
 about
 stock.


That's
 how
 I
 felt
 about
 Intel
 today.
 I


was
 like,
 dude,
 it's
 Intel.
 Trump's


investing.
 Uh
 this
 whole
 narrative
 about


the
 quantum
 stocks
 and
 they're
 up


because
 Trump
 is
 investing
 supposedly.


So
 like
 the
 entire
 narrative
 in
 terms
 of


just
 like
 how
 people
 are
 thinking
 of


these
 Trump
 investments
 is
 positive.
 So


technically
 Intel
 says
 anything
 bullish


stock
 should
 go
 up.
 But
 then
 I'm
 like


it's
 already
 up
 90%
 this
 year.
 Like
 if


they
 do
 anything
 bearish
 or
 even


anything
 that's
 good
 but
 just
 not
 that


good.
 Intel
 ended
 up
 being
 really
 good


but
 if
 it
 wasn't
 that
 good,
 this
 thing's


going
 down.
 And
 so
 I
 I
 decided
 not
 to.


But


it
 is
 always
 a
 gamble
 when
 it
 comes
 to


comes
 to
 these
 earnings.


wear
 pants
 as
 a
 shirt.
 That's,
 you
 know,


you're
 funny.
 Um,
 Benny,
 you're
 funny.


You
 are
 funny.


All right,
 guys.
 I
 think
 that's
 it.
 I


don't
 think
 there's
 any
 more
 market


news.
 I
 mean,
 we
 can
 stick
 around
 for
 a


little
 bit
 and
 just
 talk,
 but
 I
 don't


think
 there's
 any
 crazy
 market
 news.
 Oh,


this
 thing
 real
 quick.
 Let
 me
 show
 you


guys.
 I
 just
 got
 this
 headline.
 There's


a
 company
 that
 just
 raised
 1.4
 4
 billion


with
 a
 B
 tripling
 their
 valuation
 to
 10


billion
 according
 to
 the
 financial


times.
 Uh
 the
 company
 is
 called
 Crusoe


and
 they
 are
 building
 OpenAI's
 first


major
 US
 data
 center.
 What
 is
 super


bullish
 Nebus,
 Cororeweave,
 Iran,
 all


those
 companies.
 Crusoe
 is
 constructing


a
 1.2
 gigawatt
 data
 center
 in
 Texas


uh
 for
 OpenAI.
 It's
 going to
 cost
 about


12
 billion
 finished
 by
 mid26


in
 Wyoming
 as
 well.
 So
 one
 in
 Texas,
 one


in
 Wyoming.
 The
 CEO
 says
 the
 demand
 for


comput
 infrastructure
 is
 unlike
 anything


he's
 seen
 as
 AI
 spending
 by
 tech
 giants


is
 projected
 to
 exceed
 500
 billion


annually
 by
 2026.


This
 is
 why
 you've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 these


data
 center
 plays
 that
 continue
 to
 hold


their
 multiple
 because
 when
 you
 see
 a


startup,
 this
 is
 essentially
 a
 startup


raise
 a
 billion
 1.4
 billion
 to
 build


data
 centers


the
 and
 again
 this
 is
 a
 new
 company.


Think
 of
 the
 already
 established
 players


like
 a
 Cipher,
 Wolf,
 Iran,
 which
 even


though
 you
 know
 they're
 not
 as


established
 in
 the
 data
 center
 space
 as


they
 were
 Bitcoin
 mining,
 they're
 way


more
 established
 than
 a
 brand
 new


startup.
 I
 mean,
 those
 guys
 should
 be


able
 to
 get
 contracts
 way
 quicker
 than


something
 like
 a
 Crusoe,


Applied
 Digital,
 all
 those
 names,
 right?


That
 is
 why
 they
 continue
 to
 get
 some


momentum.
 Nebas
 right
 there
 107


after
 hours.


Yeah,
 I
 would
 say
 this
 is
 good
 for
 Iran.


I
 mean
 this
 is
 not
 directly
 tied
 to
 Iran


but
 all
 those
 names
 again
 there's


nothing
 fundamentally
 wrong
 with
 the


Bitcoin
 mining
 companies
 that
 are
 now


turning
 into
 data
 centers
 the
 question


is
 about
 do
 you
 buy
 them
 at
 these


valuations
 when
 they
 haven't
 necessarily


shown
 the
 growth
 yet
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get


there
 and
 you
 know
 this
 is
 the
 pro
 like


Bit
 farms
 right
 Bit
 farms
 got
 all
 the


way
 to
 660
 last
 week
 people
 bought
 it


and
 nothing
 really
 changed
 with
 the


company
 other
 than
 they
 said
 they're


pivoting
 to
 data
 centers
 there
 no
 no


massive
 massive
 deals
 and
 now
 it's
 back


down
 to
 420
 So
 this
 is
 the
 concern
 about


all
 these
 names.
 But
 again,
 if
 you


believe
 the
 broader
 tailwind
 is
 that


data
 centers
 are
 only
 increasing.
 Same


thing
 with
 rare
 earth
 companies,


then
 maybe
 it's
 just
 the
 DCA.
 Even
 if


you
 bought
 in
 at
 a
 higher
 price
 and


obviously
 the
 more
 established
 ones
 like


Corby
 and
 Nebius
 that
 have
 real
 big


contracts,
 those
 are
 probably
 some
 of


the
 best
 quality
 ones
 that
 are
 that
 are


also
 there.


So
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 That
 is
 what


we've
 got
 on
 the
 day.


All
 right,
 I
 think
 that's
 it.
 At least


for
 market
 news.
 You
 can
 just
 sit
 and


chill
 for
 a
 bit.
 That's
 pretty
 much
 it


for
 market
 stuff.


Today's
 Thursday,
 right?


Yeah,
 today's
 Thursday.
 Okay,
 so


tomorrow's
 Friday.


All right,
 so
 we
 got
 one
 more
 week
 left


of
 October.
 Call
 Steve.
 I
 don't
 Steve


was
 going
 to
 be
 on
 in
 the
 morning,
 but


he
 got
 busy.
 Today
 might
 be
 one
 of
 those


meeting
 days
 for
 him.
 He
 was
 live
 last


night
 with
 Matt.
 Dude,
 they
 were
 doing


like
 a
 movie
 tier.
 I
 tuned
 in
 for
 a


couple
 minutes
 and
 all
 I
 heard
 was
 Pulp


Fiction
 is
 S
 tier
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "No,


it's
 not."
 No,
 the
 hell
 it's
 not.
 I


don't
 know
 what
 they're
 talking
 about.


But
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 can


make
 it
 today.
 Me
 and
 Steve
 usually
 do


something
 on
 Thursday
 though
 on
 his


channel.
 So,
 I
 I
 think
 we're
 still
 on


for
 Let
 me
 text
 them.
 Usually
 at
 9:30
 on


his
 channel.


Uh
 I'll
 be
 on
 his
 channel.


Um,


Chris
 is
 traveling.
 So,
 Chris
 is
 not


there.
 Michelle
 says,
 "You
 don't
 know


anything."
 Dude,
 I
 know
 that
 Pulp


Fiction.
 It's
 not
 S
 tier.
 Y'all
 are


crazy,
 bro.
 Pulp
 Fiction
 is
 S
 tier.


Y'all
 are
 wild.


Y'all
 are
 wild.
 Mad
 Money,
 thank
 you
 for


the
 $1
 super
 chat.
 Appreciate
 it.
 And
 uh


Michelle
 Longmire,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $2


super
 chat
 and
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here


as
 well.
 You
 thought
 Heat
 was
 bad.
 Heat


was
 bad.
 I
 don't
 need
 to
 defend
 that.


Heat
 sucked,
 bro.
 Heat
 was
 not
 a
 good


movie.


Was
 not
 a
 good
 movie.


Um


Matt's
 at
 work
 right
 now
 probably.
 Matt


was
 streaming
 last
 night
 though.
 Is


Trump
 still
 live?
 Is
 he
 actually
 There's


no
 way
 he's
 still
 doing
 questions,
 bro.


There's
 no
 way.


Intel's
 still
 moving
 after
 hours.


No,
 he's
 not
 live
 anymore.
 Okay,
 he's


not
 live
 anymore.
 I
 disagree
 with
 Heat,


bro.
 I
 disagree
 with
 Heat.
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 You
 know
 what?
 You
 know what?
 You


know
 what
 I
 I
 low-key
 want
 to
 watch


again?
 a
 couple
 clips
 on
 YouTube
 popped


up
 of
 Breaking
 Bad
 and
 I
 was
 like,


"Dude,
 I
 want
 to
 watch
 this
 mo
 this
 this


show
 again.
 I've
 watched
 it
 like
 five


times
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 years."


But
 I
 saw
 like
 there
 there
 was
 a
 clip


where
 uh
 they
 interrogated
 Gus
 on
 if
 he


um
 if
 he's
 like,
 you
 know,
 the
 big
 guy


that's
 created
 this
 whole
 meth


industry.
 And
 that
 clip
 was
 so
 good
 and


I
 was
 just
 like,
 man,
 I
 want
 to
 watch


this
 again,
 but
 I
 haven't.


I
 just
 I
 just
 restarted
 watching
 it


yesterday.
 Yeah.
 See,
 there
 you
 go.


It
 is
 just
 such
 a
 I
 cannot
 believe
 Steve


has
 not
 watched
 it.
 I'm
 like,
 dude,
 it's


freaking
 breaking
 back.
 I
 really
 do


believe
 it.
 It's
 the
 best
 show
 of
 all


time.


I
 really
 do
 believe
 that.
 I
 have
 not


seen
 Boiler
 Room.
 Steve
 tells
 me
 to


watch
 that.
 Better
 Call
 Solid.
 Dude,
 I


gave
 the
 first
 episode
 a
 chance.
 I
 know


people
 say
 it's
 slow,
 but
 I
 couldn't
 get


into
 it
 on
 the
 first
 episode,
 bro.
 So,
 I


haven't
 really
 watched
 it.
 I
 probably


should
 if
 I
 like
 Breaking
 Bad
 so
 much.


Dude,
 can
 we
 talk
 about
 Severance?
 That


show
 is
 garbage.
 Like
 garbage.
 Like,
 we


have
 to
 add
 the
 French
 accent
 to
 it
 just


to
 say
 how
 bad
 it
 is.
 Like,
 I
 tried
 to


watch
 that


uh
 what
 was
 it?
 Five
 months
 ago
 around


April.
 I
 remember
 my
 cousin
 came
 over


for
 spring
 break
 and
 me,
 my
 cousin,
 and


my
 sister
 were
 watching
 it
 and
 I
 was


like,
 "What?
 What
 the
 hell
 am
 I


watching,
 bro?
 This
 is
 garb."
 Like,


"What
 is
 this,
 dude?
 What
 is
 this?"


I
 I
 could
 not
 believe
 how
 bad
 it
 was.


I
 really
 I'll
 I'll
 take
 the
 shots
 that


anyone
 wants
 to
 throw
 on
 this.
 This
 was


not
 a
 good
 show.
 This
 was
 like
 I
 I
 I
 I


first
 of
 all,
 I
 was
 falling
 asleep.


Second
 of
 all,
 I
 was
 like,
 "Where's
 the


energy?
 Where's
 the
 excitement?
 Where's


the
 narrative?
 Where's
 the
 story
 line?


Thank
 you.
 Some
 people
 are
 saying
 it's


overrated.


I'm
 unsubscribing.
 It
 was
 not
 good.
 It's


not
 good.
 What
 are
 we
 talking
 about?


[ __ ]
 wasn't
 good,
 bro.
 It's
 not
 anywhere


near
 unbreaking
 bad's
 level.


Not
 anywhere
 near.


Uh,
 yes,
 Matt
 does
 have
 a
 job.
 He's
 a


petroleum
 engineer
 at
 an
 oil
 company.


He
 has
 been
 thinking
 of
 quitting,


though,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 he's
 going
 to


quit.
 Dude,
 what
 is
 this
 K-pop
 demon


hunter
 thing?
 I
 have
 never
 seen
 this,


but
 apparently
 Netflix
 said
 it
 was
 like


their
 most
 watched
 thing
 in
 Q3.


I
 have
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 it
 is.


Also,
 this
 thing
 came
 out
 from
 Netflix.


Squid
 Games,
 freaking
 five
 billion
 hours


since
 2021
 has
 been
 spent
 watching
 this


thing.


You
 had
 1.5
 billion.
 You
 is
 actually
 one


of
 the
 greatest
 shows
 of
 all
 time.
 I


will
 defend
 that.
 Manifest
 is
 stupid.


The
 first
 two
 seasons
 are
 good.
 The
 rest


are
 trash.
 Love
 is
 blind
 is
 I
 don't


understand
 how
 you
 marry
 someone
 without


knowing
 what
 they
 look
 like.
 Like
 I


don't
 get
 it.
 Now
 I
 get
 why
 the
 show


works
 because
 it's
 such
 a
 crazy
 concept


that
 you're
 going
 to
 marry
 someone
 that


you
 don't
 know
 what
 they
 look
 like.
 I


would
 kind
 of
 want
 to
 know
 what
 they


look
 like
 before
 I
 commit
 to
 marrying


them.
 Maybe
 I'm
 a
 little
 weird,
 but
 I


don't
 know.
 That
 show
 right
 there,
 1.4


billion
 Wednesday.
 Never
 got
 into
 that.


2.9
 billion
 and
 then
 you
 had
 Squid
 Game


at
 5
 billion.


Squid
 Game
 season
 2
 season
 3
 sucked


though
 unfortunately.
 Season
 two,
 season


3
 sucked.


So
 yes,
 bring
 on
 the
 arranged
 marriage


jokes.
 Bring
 them
 on.
 That
 is
 true.


A
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 uh
 in
 the
 home


country
 ended
 up
 marrying
 without,
 you


know,
 but
 people
 people
 over
 exaggerated


it,
 bro.
 You
 you
 get
 to
 meet
 the
 person.


you
 get
 to
 have
 a
 couple
 I
 guess
 you
 can


call
 it
 dates
 but
 arranged
 dates
 and


then
 like
 ultimately
 you
 get
 to
 decide


if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 with
 them
 or
 not.
 Now


I
 think
 probably
 let's
 call
 it
 in
 the


40s
 and
 50s
 it
 was
 straight
 up
 like
 you


have
 no
 choice.
 But
 my
 mom
 went
 on
 some


dates
 with
 my
 dad.
 I
 mean
 like
 they
 they


the
 two
 families
 came
 together
 and
 then


you
 know
 they
 had
 some
 dates.
 My
 mom
 had


to
 see
 if
 she
 actually
 was
 interested


and
 and
 then
 she
 agreed
 to
 end
 up


marrying
 him.


But
 probably,
 you
 know,
 her
 mom,
 my


grandmother,
 just
 like
 straight
 up
 have


no
 choice.


So,
 it's
 not
 as
 aggressive
 as
 people


think.
 But
 it's
 also
 not
 just
 Indians,


bro.
 It's
 like
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 parts
 of


the
 world
 where
 arrange
 marriage
 is
 like


the
 standard.
 It's
 really
 in
 the
 west


that
 we
 have
 this
 whole
 concept
 of


getting
 to
 know
 someone
 and
 like
 falling


in
 love
 and
 all
 this
 [ __ ]


But
 yeah,
 across
 the
 eastern
 part
 of
 the


hemisphere,
 it's
 a
 lot
 more
 formal
 than


that.


Chris
 said
 there
 was
 a
 book
 cat.
 Yes,


there
 is
 a
 book.
 Well,
 has
 anyone
 seen


Indian
 matchmaking
 on
 Netflix?
 Which
 is


actually
 a
 great
 show.
 Um,
 there
 is
 a


biodata
 and
 you
 get
 to
 literally
 scroll


through
 a
 book
 and
 like
 see
 someone's
 I


mean
 do
 bro
 but
 it's
 not
 that
 crazy


because
 it's
 like
 Tinder
 or
 Hinge,


right?
 It
 literally
 on
 Hinge
 that's
 your


bio
 data.
 That's
 like
 your
 your
 height


and
 this
 and
 that
 and
 what
 you're


interested
 in
 and
 if
 you
 smoke
 or
 don't


smoke.
 Same
 thing
 in
 matchmaking,


but
 it's
 it's
 a
 different
 way.
 By
 the


way,
 you
 know,
 this
 brings
 up
 a
 funny


story.
 This,
 okay,
 you
 guys
 you
 guys
 are


going
 to
 think
 this
 is
 funny.
 So,
 when
 I


was
 with
 Derek
 back
 in
 Miami,
 he
 had


tons
 and
 tons
 of
 meetings
 throughout
 the


day,
 right?
 And
 I
 was
 doing
 my
 own


thing.
 And
 then
 I
 I
 went
 and
 I
 got
 lunch


with
 Adam
 Bergman,
 which
 I'm
 going
 to


see
 tomorrow.
 Me
 and
 Bergman
 are
 going


to
 get
 some
 some
 dinner
 in
 the
 city.
 And


um
 and
 and
 we
 went
 and
 got
 lunch.
 And


then
 we
 came
 back.
 and
 I
 came
 back


five
 seconds,
 I'm
 exaggerating,
 five


minutes
 before
 he
 gets
 into
 a
 meeting.


And
 so
 I
 walk
 into
 the
 house
 and
 he's


like,
 "You're
 going
 to
 want
 to
 listen
 to


this
 meeting."
 And
 so
 we
 we
 we
 get
 in
 I


so
 I
 so
 I
 so
 I
 sit
 down
 next
 to
 him.
 He


takes
 a
 meeting
 with
 a
 professional


matchmaker.


Now
 Derek
 is
 divorced
 twice
 over.
 He
 has


three
 kids.
 He's
 running
 a
 big
 startup.


He's
 not
 really
 interested
 in
 like


getting
 married
 or
 dating
 or
 any
 of


this.
 If
 he
 wanted
 to
 date,
 he
 could


date.
 He
 broke
 up
 with
 his
 girlfriend
 of


two
 years
 uh
 about
 12
 months
 ago
 because


he
 wants
 to
 focus
 on
 a
 startup.
 So
 like


he's
 not
 really
 interested
 in
 dating.


But
 the
 email
 was
 so
 compelling
 and
 he


gets
 these
 emails
 all
 the
 time,
 but
 this


one
 for
 some
 reason
 was
 so
 compelling
 to


him.
 He
 decided
 to
 take
 the
 meeting.
 And


so
 I'm
 sitting
 in
 the
 corner
 while
 he's


taking
 this
 meeting.
 Yeah.
 Michelle


knows
 about
 this.
 Michelle
 was
 in
 Miami.


She
 heard
 the
 story.
 And
 this
 is
 not


just
 matchmaking.
 This
 is
 billionaire


matchmaking.
 this
 Dererick's
 rich
 and


there's
 other
 women
 that
 are
 rich
 and


it's
 not
 that
 easy
 to
 date
 when
 you're


that
 rich.
 So,
 you
 like
 go
 to
 these


professional


wealth
 matchmaker,
 whatever
 you
 want
 to


call
 them,
 people
 that
 work
 for
 very


wealthy
 people
 to
 matchmake
 and
 and
 you


you
 try
 to
 find
 love.
 And
 so
 we're
 in


this
 meeting
 and
 this
 is
 the
 funniest


[ __ ]
 ever
 because
 this
 matchmaker
 is


trying
 to
 like
 figure
 out
 if
 his
 client


is
 a
 match
 for
 Derek
 and
 he's
 asking
 him


all
 these
 questions
 and
 trying
 to
 figure


out
 all
 these
 beliefs
 and
 then
 he's
 like


he's
 like
 um
 so
 you
 know
 I'm
 I'm


assuming
 you
 you
 know
 you're
 you're


you're
 liberal
 and
 you
 you
 know
 you
 care


about
 the
 environment
 and
 all
 this
 stuff


based
 on
 all
 these
 prior
 questions
 he


asked.
 And
 Dererick's
 like
 I'm
 not


[ __ ]
 liberal.
 And
 the
 guy's
 like,


"Well,
 we,
 you
 know,
 we
 I
 got
 the


impression
 Derrick's
 like,
 I'm
 not


liberal."
 Derrick's
 like,
 "I'm
 a
 single


guy
 living
 in
 Miami.
 You
 think
 I'm


liberal?"
 And
 so
 the
 guy
 completely
 read


the
 room
 wrong.
 And
 he
 thought
 Derek
 was


like
 this
 uber
 liberal
 dude.
 I
 think


it's
 cuz
 Dererick's
 from
 California,
 so


he's
 assumed
 white
 guy
 from
 California,


liberal,
 but
 that's
 like
 the
 opposite


direction.
 The
 client
 apparently
 is


super
 liberal.
 And
 he
 and
 and
 then
 so
 he


and
 then
 so
 Derek
 was
 like,
 "All
 right,


I
 guess
 politics
 is
 a
 is
 a
 is
 a
 um
 you


know,
 a
 thesis
 breaker."
 Thsis
 breaker.


I'm
 using
 stock
 terms.
 It's
 it's
 like
 it


means
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 work
 because
 you


know,
 you
 you
 assumed
 I'm
 super
 liberal.


Not
 because
 Dererick
 doesn't
 want
 to
 be


with
 a
 liberal,
 but
 because
 that
 that


matchmaker
 was
 so
 intent
 that
 he's


connecting
 two
 liberals
 and
 the


matchmaker
 was
 like,
 "No,
 no,
 it's
 okay.


It's
 okay.
 She
 doesn't
 care
 about


politics,
 blah
 blah
 blah
 blah."
 And


Derek
 was
 like, "All
 right,
 whatever."


And
 then
 it
 took
 like
 40
 minutes
 to


finally
 get
 a
 picture
 of
 this
 chick.
 I'm


over
 here
 on
 the
 side
 trying
 to
 just


find
 this
 chick
 because
 he
 was
 like,


"Well,
 she
 worked
 at
 this
 company
 and


she
 had
 these
 acquisitions."
 And
 so
 I'm


like
 typing
 random
 [ __ ]
 into
 Google
 to


try
 to
 see
 what
 does
 she
 look
 like?


Because
 all
 I
 care
 about
 quite
 frankly,


I
 think
 all
 Dererick
 cared
 about
 was


like, "Is
 she
 hot,
 bro?
 Like
 is
 she
 like


is
 she
 hot
 or
 not?"
 Like
 this
 whole


freaking
 45minute
 discussion
 and
 they


started
 talking
 about
 spirituality
 and


all
 this
 [ __ ]
 Like
 bro,
 what
 is
 her


name?
 What's
 her
 IG?
 Is
 she
 pretty?
 And


then
 we
 finally
 see
 what
 she
 looks
 like.


and
 me
 and
 him
 just
 look
 at
 each
 other


and
 then
 he's
 like,
 "All
 right,
 well,


thank
 you
 for
 your
 time.
 I
 appreciate


the
 meeting."
 yada
 yada.
 And
 then,
 you


know,
 the
 the
 the
 uh
 the
 meeting
 ends


and
 Derrick's
 like,
 "Bro,
 she
 is
 [ __ ]


ugly."
 And
 I
 was
 like, "Dude,
 we
 just


wasted
 45
 minutes.
 Dude
 could
 have
 just


showed
 us
 the
 picture
 in
 the
 first
 five


seconds.
 We
 would
 have
 had
 a
 decision.


We
 would
 have
 had
 a
 I
 mean,
 like
 because


I
 know
 Derek,
 I
 know
 some
 of
 the
 women


Dererick's
 been
 with.
 I'm
 like,
 "Bro,


that's
 not
 like
 that's
 not
 your
 type.


Not
 even
 in
 the
 slate."
 Like
 we
 could


have
 known
 within
 five
 seconds
 went


through
 this
 whole
 spirituality


political
 nonsense.
 And
 then
 I
 find
 her


Instagram.
 I
 find
 her
 Instagram.
 And
 so


I
 go
 on
 her
 I'm
 like,
 "Bro,
 I
 found
 her


Instagram."
 And
 so
 we're
 going
 through


her
 Instagram.
 This
 chick,
 you
 know,
 the


matchmaker
 said
 she's
 not
 liberal.
 She's


open
 to
 polit.
 This
 chick
 has
 every


single
 liberal
 characteristic.


Black
 lives
 matter.
 Trans
 lives
 matter.


this
 like
 every
 other
 picture,
 bro,
 is


her
 like
 campaigning
 that
 which
 is
 fine.


Like
 that's
 totally
 fine,
 but
 like
 it's


just
 you're
 not
 it's
 the
 opposite
 of


what
 the
 matchmaker
 the
 matchmaker
 was


like.
 She's
 super
 open
 to
 all
 these,
 you


know,
 different
 perspective.
 Like
 I


don't
 think
 she
 wants
 to
 be
 with
 someone


who
 voted
 for
 Trump.
 I'm
 I'm
 just
 I


don't
 think
 that
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


how
 it's
 going
 to
 work.
 So


the
 whole
 point
 of
 the
 story
 is
 just


like
 it's
 kind
 of
 crazy
 because
 at
 that


level
 I
 would
 imagine
 she
 paid
 the


matchmaker
 probably
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 of
 dollars
 because
 she's
 a


billionaire,
 right?
 So
 she
 can
 afford
 it


to
 find
 her
 someone
 and
 the
 guy
 like


really
 wanted
 Derek
 to
 go
 on
 a
 date
 with


her.
 But
 you
 know
 he
 he
 ended
 up
 saying


no.
 And
 after
 we
 found
 out
 all
 this


information
 I
 was
 just
 like
 well
 that


was
 a
 waste
 of
 time
 because
 there
 was


nothing
 there.


But
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 crazy
 because
 it's


like
 first
 of
 all
 again
 Dererick's
 not


opposed
 to
 being
 with
 someone
 super


liberal
 but
 that's
 just
 not
 his


personality
 like
 that's
 just
 not
 who
 he


is
 and
 sometimes
 you
 kind
 of
 need


certain
 things
 to
 align
 to
 be
 able
 to
 be


compatible.
 So
 that
 [ __ ]
 didn't
 work.


And
 then
 number
 two
 is
 like
 we
 just
 dude


we
 needed
 to
 see
 her
 picture
 really


quickly
 and
 that
 that
 that
 would
 have


decided
 everything.


That
 would
 have
 decided
 would
 you
 date


her
 for
 the
 money?
 No,
 I
 would
 not
 date


her
 for
 the
 money.
 I
 think
 I
 think,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 very
 generalistic


of
 me,
 but
 I
 really
 do
 think
 guys
 care


more
 about
 the
 physical
 attraction
 and


girls
 care
 more
 about
 the
 potential
 of
 a


man.
 Girls
 care
 more
 about
 the
 ambition


of
 a
 guy.
 Like,
 yes,
 girls
 care
 about


the
 physical
 attraction,
 but
 I
 think


they
 really
 do
 care
 about
 safety
 and


being
 protected
 and
 knowing
 they
 can
 be


taken
 care
 of.


The
 guy
 wants
 to
 know,
 is
 she
 hot?
 Like,


that's
 that's
 the
 most
 important
 thing.


I
 think
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 guys,
 you
 know,
 I'm


sure
 it's
 not
 for
 every
 single
 guy,
 but


I
 think
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 guys,
 that's
 the


thing.
 So,


it
 was
 just
 a
 hilarious
 story
 because


I'm
 I
 listened
 to
 Derek
 negotiate
 a
 deal


with
 someone
 in
 China
 earlier
 in
 the


day.
 So,
 that
 was
 like
 an
 intense


business
 negotiation.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Wow,


this
 is
 really
 cool
 to
 like
 listen
 to


hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 dollars
 flowing


over
 the
 phone
 in
 over
 15
 minutes."
 And


then
 I
 went
 with
 with
 Adam.
 We
 got


lunch.
 And
 then
 I
 come
 back
 and
 then
 I


hear
 some
 matchmaking
 conversation
 that


was
 literally
 pointless.
 But
 I
 could


only
 imagine
 how
 much
 that
 woman
 is


paying
 this
 guy
 who's
 been
 doing
 it


apparently
 for
 like
 40
 years
 to
 like


find
 her
 love.


It's
 just
 kind
 of
 wild
 for
 how
 you
 know


how
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 matchmaking
 ends
 up


turns
 out
 how
 it
 ends
 up
 turning
 out
 to


happen.


But
 yeah,
 she
 was
 no
 she
 was
 not
 fat.


She
 was
 dude
 it
 wasn't
 anything
 like


that.
 It's
 just
 like
 sometime
 like
 there


was
 another
 girl
 that
 I
 showed
 Derek


that
 um
 that
 I
 thought
 he
 would
 be
 into


who's
 in
 his
 age
 and
 I
 know
 her
 from


some
 personal
 connections
 and
 I
 was


like,
 "Yo,
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you
 think


of
 this
 chick?"
 And
 as
 soon
 as
 I
 showed


her
 Instagram,
 he's
 like, "Bro,
 she's


hot."
 I
 was
 like, "Can
 I
 talk
 to
 her?"
 I


was
 like,
 "Yeah,
 you
 both
 are
 single.


You're
 you're
 both
 in
 the
 same
 age.


Like,
 I
 I'll
 I'll
 try
 to
 make
 it


happen."
 And
 so,
 like
 within
 two


seconds,
 he
 was
 like, "Yeah,
 I
 want
 to


talk
 to
 her."
 And
 then
 you
 go
 on
 this


40minute
 like
 spiritual
 journey
 with


this
 matchmaker
 and
 you
 know
 he's
 just


like
 no
 this
 does
 not
 happen.
 This
 does


not
 happen.
 So


I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 it's
 just


it's
 just
 a
 gut
 feeling
 based
 on


physical
 attraction
 many
 times.


Well
 that's
 what
 you
 got.


Amit
 would
 you
 only
 date
 an
 Indian
 or


are
 you
 open
 to
 other
 races?
 No
 I've


I've
 dated
 other
 races
 before.
 I've
 been


with
 other
 girls
 that
 are
 not
 Indian.


I'm
 I'm
 not
 only
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 I
 don't


know.
 I
 think
 it's
 like
 it's
 weird
 to


restrict
 yourself
 to
 only
 one
 category.


Um
 obviously
 it's
 probably
 easier
 if


it's
 like
 in
 the
 same
 race
 because
 of


holidays
 and
 religious
 stuff
 and
 even


though
 I'm
 not
 that
 religious,
 but
 I


wouldn't
 artificially
 restrict
 my
 I
 just


feel
 like
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 a
 bit
 weird


sometimes
 going
 through
 that
 route.
 In


fact,
 when
 we
 do
 the
 uh
 you
 know,
 when


we
 do
 the
 28-year-old
 birthday
 pictures,


you
 you
 might
 see
 some
 some
 uh
 some


other
 people
 in
 these
 photos
 that
 uh


that
 I've
 uh
 interact
 with
 over
 the
 past


28
 years.
 I
 don't
 know.
 Maybe.


Maybe.
 Religion
 can
 be
 a
 dealbreaker,


though.
 Yes,
 that
 is
 correct.
 Religion


can
 be
 a
 dealbreaker.
 I
 don't
 know,


dude.
 I'm
 not
 super
 religious.
 So,
 if
 I


were
 to
 ever
 be
 with
 someone
 who's
 like


hardcore
 religious
 about
 whatever


religion,
 I'm
 just
 like
 I'm
 not
 like


that.
 Like,
 it's
 not
 that
 serious,
 bro.


Like,
 it's
 just
 at least
 to
 me.
 I


respect
 it
 for
 other
 people
 that
 it's


really
 serious.
 But
 if
 they
 try
 to
 get


me
 to
 be
 super
 serious
 about
 it,
 it's


tough
 because
 I'm
 like,
 well,
 just
 might


not
 be
 something
 that
 I
 care
 about
 that


much.


So,
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 feel
 I
 I
 do
 think


that,
 you
 know,
 as
 I
 get
 into
 the
 dating


ecosystem,
 it's
 just
 I
 was
 talking
 about


this
 with
 So,
 I
 was
 actually
 talking


with
 someone
 the
 other
 day
 who
 um
 now


No,
 he
 he
 used
 to
 work
 at
 Hinge.
 He
 used


to
 work
 at
 Hinge
 and
 it's
 the
 same
 guy
 I


told
 you
 that
 that
 that
 works
 at
 uh


Square
 now
 and
 he's
 like
 super
 into


Robin
 Hood.
 He
 sells
 all
 of
 his
 Square


stock
 every
 time.
 He
 gets
 restricted


options
 and
 and
 just
 buys
 Robin
 Hood


stock.
 He
 used
 to
 work
 at
 Hinge
 before


that
 and
 he
 was
 telling
 me
 about
 the


algorithm
 and
 he
 was
 like,
 "Bro,
 I
 left


Hinge
 cuz
 like
 their
 algo
 people
 are


just
 like
 evil."
 He's
 like,
 "I
 tried
 to


like
 advise
 them
 on
 how
 to
 cultivate
 the


algorithm
 to
 try
 to
 like
 give
 people
 a


chance
 and
 and
 like
 actually
 open
 up


opportunities."
 Like
 these
 algo
 people,


they're
 just
 like
 hyperfocused
 on
 making


sure
 they
 can
 like
 get
 the
 match,
 but


not
 the
 right
 match,
 but
 the
 match
 that


keeps
 you
 onto
 the
 platform.
 And
 it's


like
 think
 of
 that
 the
 Facebook


advertising
 algorithm
 which
 we
 all
 know


is
 like
 super
 you
 know
 crazy
 and
 and
 and


and
 like
 invading
 of
 your
 privacy
 even


though
 we
 give
 up
 all
 of
 our
 privacy
 to


Facebook
 anyway.
 And
 then
 think
 of
 that


times
 100
 on
 Hinge
 in
 the
 context
 of


love.
 And
 he
 worked
 at
 Tinder
 before


Hinge.
 So
 he's
 he's
 been
 in
 the
 dating


app
 world
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 now
 he


works
 at
 a
 fintech
 but
 he's
 just
 like


you
 know
 he
 hated
 the
 way
 that
 a
 lot
 of


those
 companies
 operate.


Robert
 says
 dude
 they
 are
 legit
 evil.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 he
 did
 not
 have
 a
 friendly


interpretation
 of


of
 those
 platforms.


I
 don't
 know
 though,
 bro.
 I
 don't
 know.


Dating
 is
 a
 weird
 world,
 especially
 in


this
 generation.


Like,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 Every
 time
 like
 I


I
 speak
 to
 a
 new
 friend
 and
 like
 how


they're
 interacting
 in
 that
 world,


they're
 like,
 "Dude,
 it's
 the
 apps."


They're
 like,
 they
 don't
 don't
 go
 up
 to


people
 in
 a
 bar
 or
 something.
 It's
 like


it's
 so
 it's
 just
 like
 not
 part
 of
 the


way
 people
 interact
 anymore.
 Intel
 is


still
 up
 after
 hours
 but
 losing
 41.


So
 I
 wonder
 how
 that
 ends
 up
 playing


out.
 Also
 the
 AI
 stuff,
 right?
 Like
 I


mean
 dude,
 this
 whole
 chat
 GBT
 erotica


thing
 really
 freaked
 me
 out.
 I
 was


listening
 to
 uh
 you
 know
 there's
 a
 good


take
 by
 Sager
 on
 breaking
 points
 and
 he


was
 talking
 about
 it
 and
 he
 was
 just


like
 this
 [ __ ]
 is
 the
 worst
 thing
 that


could
 happen
 to
 humanity
 in
 the


especially
 for
 men
 in
 the
 country
 that


already
 feel
 isolated.
 Now
 they
 have


this
 AI
 girlfriend
 that
 they
 can
 talk


to.
 Like


it's
 just
 it's
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where


it's
 like


where
 where
 does
 that
 leave
 us
 as
 human


species
 if
 that
 plays
 up?


I
 don't
 know.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 it'll
 happen.


I
 don't
 think
 a
 will
 ever
 come
 out


because
 of
 his
 Indian
 parents.
 Dude,
 how


many
 of
 you
 guys
 think
 I'm
 actually
 gay?


Are
 they
 is
 there
 is
 there
 just
 like
 is


there
 a
 real
 percentage
 of
 people
 that


legit
 think
 I'm
 gay?


I
 can
 say
 I'm
 not,
 but
 like
 it's
 you


know
 I
 don't
 really
 care
 if
 people


believe
 me
 or
 not.


I
 feel
 like
 if
 I
 was
 gay
 I
 have
 parents


that
 are
 understanding
 enough
 that
 they


would
 I
 mean
 dude
 I'm
 an
 Indian
 YouTuber


like
 there's
 not
 many
 of
 us
 right?
 So


they're
 already
 very
 liberal
 in
 terms
 of


that
 respect
 and
 understanding
 like
 I'm


trying
 to
 do
 my
 own
 thing
 in
 life
 and


all
 this
 stuff.
 And
 you
 know
 thankfully


over
 the
 past
 couple
 years
 it's
 worked


out.


I'm
 just
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 gay.


So
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 you
 want
 me
 to
 tell


you.
 I'm
 just
 not.
 Do
 a
 poll.
 Okay.


Let's
 do
 a
 poll.
 Let's
 do
 a
 poll.
 This


is
 why
 I
 told
 Arie
 and
 Amir
 we
 were


randomly
 walking.
 We
 were
 getting
 lunch


and
 I
 was like
 guys
 you
 know
 I'm
 not


gay,
 right?
 They're
 like,
 "That's


exactly
 what
 some
 like."
 No,
 I'm
 just


like,
 I
 just
 want
 you
 guys
 to
 like
 I'm


actually
 not.
 Like,
 I
 know
 people
 make
 a


joke
 out
 of
 it,
 but


this
 is
 the
 weirdest
 question.
 Do
 you


think
 I
 am
 gay?
 This
 is
 that
 This
 is


that
 meme.
 I'm
 gonna
 I'm
 gonna
 spell
 it


like
 how
 the
 meme
 spells
 it.
 Are
 you


gay?


Are
 you
 gay?
 Where's
 that
 meme?


Oh
 my
 gosh.


This
 is
 it.
 This
 is
 it.
 Oh,
 wait.
 I


said,
 "Are
 you
 gay?"
 I'm
 supposed
 to


say,
 "Do
 you
 think
 I
 am
 I
 gay?"
 Okay,
 I


need
 I
 typed
 it
 the
 wrong
 way.
 Hold
 on.


Oh,
 if
 you
 say
 yes
 on
 that
 now,
 if
 you


say
 yes
 on
 that,
 I
 mean,
 you
 might
 have


just
 outed
 yourself.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


lie.


You
 might
 have
 just
 outed
 yourself.


Okay.
 Do
 you
 think
 I
 am
 gay?


For
 those
 that
 haven't
 seen
 it,
 this
 is


the
 funniest
 [ __ ]
 ever,
 bro.


We
 bring
 in
 the
 studio
 this
 morning
 one


of
 the
 gay
 rights
 activists,
 Mr.
 Should


I
 call
 you
 Mr.
 Pepe?
 Julian
 Onima,
 thank


you
 for
 coming
 in.


>> Thank
 you
 for


>> Good
 morning.


>> Morning
 to
 you.


>> Why
 are
 you
 gay?


>> Who
 says
 I'm
 gay?


>> You
 are
 gay.


Julian
 Onima,
 thank
 you
 for
 coming
 in.


>> Thank
 you
 for


>> Good
 morning.


>> Morning
 to
 you.


>> Why
 are
 you
 gay?


>> Who
 says
 I'm
 gay?


You
 are
 gay.


>> That's
 why
 when
 Elon
 tweeted
 that,
 it


was
 hilarious.
 Bro,
 58%
 of
 you
 actually


picked
 yes.


All
 right,
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 Polls
 don't


lie.


Polls
 do
 not
 lie.


Um,


I
 don't
 know
 if
 I'm
 doing
 the
 thing
 with


Steve
 today.


Uh,


let
 me
 ask.


He's
 Yeah,
 he's
 in
 a
 couple
 meetings


right
 now,
 too.


I'm
 asking
 if
 9:30


still
 works.


Um


um


it's
 the
 eyebrows
 of
 it.
 Oh
 my
 gosh.


Can't
 believe
 that
 wasn't
 higher
 from


the
 chat.


Dude,
 I
 I
 really
 never
 get
 offended
 or


take
 it
 seriously
 when
 people
 like
 make


those
 gauge.
 Like
 I
 really
 just
 don't.


Like
 if
 it
 actually
 got
 to
 me,
 I
 would
 I


would
 say
 something
 about
 it.
 I
 would
 be


like,
 "Guys,
 like
 yesterday
 when
 someone


said
 Michael
 J.
 Fox
 died
 in
 the
 chat,


I'm
 like,
 "Guys,
 can
 we
 not
 Dude,
 like
 I


never
 like
 to
 be
 the
 person
 who
 scolds


the
 chat
 or
 something."
 I
 feel
 like


that's
 so
 cringe
 when
 YouTubers
 try
 to


like
 talk
 down
 to
 their
 chat
 or
 their


audience
 because
 like,
 dude,
 they're


watching
 you.
 You
 should
 be,
 you
 know,


appreciative
 that
 they
 actually
 care


about
 consuming
 your
 content.
 So,
 I
 hate


acting
 like
 that.
 Like,
 I
 really
 hate


it.
 But
 if
 someone
 says
 someone's
 dying


in
 the
 like
 then
 it's
 like,
 all right,


that's
 not
 like
 that's
 not
 cool,
 right?


So,
 if
 I
 was
 really
 like
 offended
 by


this
 or
 it
 messed
 up
 my
 vibe
 or
 my
 mojo


or
 my
 flow
 of
 trying
 to
 get
 through
 the


stream,
 I
 would
 say
 like,
 "Guys,
 can
 we


stop
 it,
 please?
 Like,
 it's
 not
 it's
 not


like
 it's
 really
 getting
 to
 me."
 I
 I


don't
 care.
 But,
 ironic,
 that
 just
 means


more
 people
 are
 going
 to
 keep
 doing
 it,


which
 is
 whatever
 because
 I
 really
 don't


care.
 So,
 he
 just
 makes
 a
 joke
 out
 of


it.
 But,
 uh,
 it
 is
 funny
 regardless.


Tanner
 yells
 at
 people.
 Yeah.
 Well,


people
 have
 different
 vibes.
 Tanner


Tanner
 yell.
 Tanner
 has
 talked
 down
 to


his
 chat,
 but
 when
 he
 does
 it,
 it's
 the


funniest
 [ __ ]
 ever
 because
 Tanner's
 not


a
 mean
 person,
 right?
 Tanner's
 like


Tanner
 is
 a
 princess.
 Like
 he's
 like


he's
 just
 like
 he's
 a
 So
 it's
 like
 when


Tanner
 raises
 his
 voice,
 it's
 hilarious


because
 I
 remember
 this
 one
 guy
 told


gave
 a
 Tanner
 a
 super
 chat
 and
 was
 like,


"Tanner,
 finish
 your
 water."
 And
 he
 was


like,
 "I'm
 not
 one
 of
 your
 play
 girls


that
 you
 can
 just
 tell
 to
 finish
 your


water.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 finish
 my
 water.


Screw
 you.
 It
 was
 the
 funniest
 [ __ ]
 I


was
 driving.
 I
 had
 to
 stop
 driving
 to


type
 LOL
 in
 the
 chat.
 I
 had
 to
 type
 LOL


in
 the
 chat,
 bro.
 Like,
 it
 was


hilarious.


So,


yeah,
 when
 Tanner
 talks
 down,
 it's
 more


so
 just
 him
 being
 himself.


But
 then
 there's
 other
 people
 that


actually
 like
 legit
 do
 I'm
 just
 like,


dude,
 like
 it's
 it's
 cringe.
 Like,
 you


don't
 have
 to
 do
 it
 like
 that.


especially
 because
 I'm
 no
 smarter
 than


anyone
 else,
 right?
 So,
 it's
 like
 having


that
 type
 of
 ego
 is
 just
 not
 the
 way
 to


go
 about
 it.


>> Um,


do
 you
 think
 Navius
 will
 pop
 after


earnings?
 I
 don't
 know,
 bro.


I
 I I


unless
 they
 announce
 another
 hyperscaler


deal,
 we
 already
 know
 their
 numbers.


Their
 numbers
 are
 going
 to
 be
 great.
 So,


I
 feel
 like
 that's
 baked
 into
 the
 price.


So,
 then
 the
 question
 becomes,
 what
 do


they
 say
 that
 we
 don't
 know
 about?
 And


okay,
 Steve
 and
 I
 are
 on
 for
 9:30.


I
 think
 they'll
 do.
 I
 think
 they'll
 have


good
 earnings.
 But
 same
 thing
 with
 Hood,


bro.
 Even
 if
 Hood
 doesn't
 go
 back
 to
 150


after
 earnings,
 like
 I
 am
 just
 trying
 to


be
 grateful
 for
 the
 gains
 this
 year.
 We


got
 to
 buy
 Hood
 at
 30
 bucks
 this
 year.


It's
 at
 freaking
 135.
 Like
 I'm
 not
 going


to
 be
 ungrateful
 if
 it
 doesn't
 get
 back


to
 50
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 And
 for


Nebius,
 most
 of
 you
 guys
 have
 an
 average


below
 50.
 Even
 if
 you're
 at
 60
 70,
 I


mean,
 you
 can't
 be
 that
 upset
 if
 it


doesn't
 get
 back
 to
 140.
 So,


I
 am
 thinking
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 different


strategies
 for
 2026,
 dude.
 I'm
 thinking


for
 a
 lot
 of
 strategies
 in
 2026.
 I
 was


thinking
 of
 coming
 out
 with
 a
 Substart


article
 about
 and
 I'll
 make
 a
 video
 on


this
 as
 well.
 Cipher's
 mooning.
 Hold
 on.


What's
 happening
 to
 Cipher?
 I
 think
 you


got
 a
 deal
 after
 hours.


I
 think
 you
 got
 a
 deal.
 Oh,
 dude.
 This


is
 the
 dumbest
 reason
 for
 it
 to
 pump.


Okay.
 Jane
 Street
 owns
 5%
 of
 Cipher.
 the


the
 these
 things
 every
 time
 they
 happen


the
 stock
 ends
 up
 correcting.
 Maybe
 that


doesn't
 happen
 with
 Cipher,
 but
 this


happened
 with
 Robin
 Hood
 a
 month
 ago.


Black
 Rockck
 own
 said
 they
 own
 5%
 of


Robin.
 It's
 like
 these
 are
 market


makers.
 They
 have
 to
 own
 the
 stock.
 They


are
 selling
 calls
 against
 them.
 They
 are


fulfilling
 orders
 for
 millions
 of
 people


on
 Schwab
 and
 Fidelity
 and
 Weeble
 and


Robin
 that
 are
 buying
 Cipher.
 They
 need


to
 when
 you
 buy
 those
 shares,
 someone


has
 to
 execute
 those
 orders.
 Usually


it's
 a
 Citadel
 or
 a
 Jane
 Street.


So
 these
 are
 not
 I
 mean
 Jane
 Street
 owns


freaking
 like
 80
 million
 shares
 of
 Open


Door.
 That
 doesn't
 mean
 they're
 super


bullish
 open.
 That
 doesn't
 mean
 they're


bullish.
 A
 lot
 black
 Black
 Rockck


Vanguard
 these
 guys
 own
 everything.
 They


have
 to
 own
 everything.
 So
 whenever


someone's
 like,
 "Well,
 Black
 Rockck
 owns


this
 much."
 It's
 like,
 but
 that
 doesn't


matter.
 Like
 of
 course
 they
 own
 it.
 They


own
 a
 ton
 of
 Grab
 too
 because
 they
 have


to
 because
 other
 people
 are
 buying
 Grab


and
 they
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 they
 can


fulfill
 those
 orders.


But
 stock
 is,
 you
 know,
 it
 stocks
 tend


to
 pump
 as
 soon
 as
 those
 news
 come
 out.


But
 they
 usually
 care.
 You're
 already


seeing
 a
 little bit
 of
 red
 candle
 right


there
 on
 Cipher.


It
 wouldn't
 be
 the
 most
 substantial


move.
 What
 I
 was
 saying
 is
 I'm
 thinking


of
 creating
 like
 five
 different
 ways
 to


approach
 a
 portfolio
 in
 2026
 because
 we


have
 this
 YouTube
 portfolio
 that
 we're


going
 to
 be
 starting
 next
 year.
 And
 I'm


thinking
 what
 are
 the
 different
 dynamics


and
 ways
 we
 can
 approach
 managing
 or


building
 a
 portfolio
 if
 you
 have
 to


start
 from
 January
 1
 prices,
 not
 today's


prices,
 but
 January
 1
 prices,
 which
 we


don't
 know
 yet,
 right?
 So,
 it's
 kind
 of


having
 some
 assumptions
 of
 of
 what
 the


world
 looks
 like
 and
 then
 maybe
 things


are
 too
 expensive
 and
 you
 hold
 on
 to


cash
 in
 in
 January.
 But
 usually
 January


you
 get
 a
 dip
 because
 people
 sell
 for


for
 taxes
 and
 so
 um
 that
 tends
 to
 be
 a


decent
 opportunity.
 But
 I'm
 trying
 to


think
 of
 different
 ways
 to
 to
 to
 format


what
 2026
 looks
 like
 if
 you're
 building


out
 a
 portfolio.
 What
 themes,
 what


sectors?


So
 that
 stuff
 is
 is
 important.
 Is
 Tanner


in
 the
 chat?


Don't
 Tanner,
 I
 was
 saying
 when
 you
 try


to
 yell
 in
 your
 live
 streams
 or
 you
 get


like
 a
 little
 agitated
 by
 someone's


comments,
 it's
 hilarious


because
 like
 you're
 a
 teddy
 bear,
 bro.


You're
 a
 princess.
 Like
 it's
 it's
 like


it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 you
 can't
 get
 I've


never
 seen
 Tanner
 actually
 angry
 or


upset
 ever.


Even
 in
 our
 personal
 conversations,
 like


I've
 never
 seen
 him
 legit
 mad.
 The
 la


the
 last
 time
 I
 saw
 Tanner
 mad
 was
 when


YouTube
 banned
 his
 video
 for
 10
 minutes.


That's
 when
 I
 actually
 saw
 him
 a
 little


pissed
 off.


But
 he
 can't
 easily,
 you
 know,
 get
 that


upset.


You
 guys
 do
 try
 to
 get
 under
 t
 under


tanner
 skin
 with
 Lori
 and
 all
 this


stuff.
 Like
 you,
 you
 guys
 definitely
 do


try
 to
 get
 under
 his
 skin.


He
 gets
 mildly
 annoyed
 at
 chat
 for
 two


minutes
 at
 a
 time.


That's
 fun.
 Does
 Tanner
 know
 you're
 gay?


Yes,
 Tanner.


Tanner.


Tanner.
 Unfortunately,


look,
 I
 tried,
 guys.
 I
 tried
 to
 get
 him


on
 the
 market
 open
 in
 Vegas,
 and
 I


recommended
 an
 idea
 for
 me
 to
 make
 sure


he
 would
 get
 on
 the
 market
 open,
 but
 he


he
 rejected
 that
 idea.
 So,


unfortunately,
 I
 tried.
 Although,
 he
 did


end
 up
 making
 it
 like
 two
 hours
 later.


Yeah,
 when
 Trump
 banned
 H20
 chips,
 I
 was


pissed.
 That's
 also
 true.


Use
 his
 bathroom
 and
 find
 out.
 Okay,


that
 was
 funny.
 I
 thought
 Tanner
 would


get
 mad
 if
 we
 told
 the
 bathroom
 story
 to


everybody,
 but
 he
 was
 like,
 "No,
 go
 for


it."
 I
 was
 like, "All
 right,
 good."


Because
 this
 is
 too
 funny
 for
 us
 to
 not


tell
 everybody.
 This
 is
 too
 freaking


funny
 for
 us
 to
 not
 tell
 people
 how
 you


feel
 about
 bathrooms.
 And
 most
 of
 you


guys
 agreed
 with
 him,
 too.
 So,
 to
 his


credit,


but
 that
 was
 hilarious.


Um,


what
 were
 we
 even
 talking
 about?
 How
 did


we
 even
 get
 here,
 bro?


I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 we
 freaking
 got


here.
 We're
 talking
 about
 the


matchmaking
 thing
 with
 Derek.


But


yeah,
 that's
 kind
 of
 how
 we
 got
 here.


Cipher
 still
 moving


after
 hour.
 Now
 it's
 already
 getting
 a


red
 candle.
 Yeah,
 this
 dude.
 These


disclosures
 from
 institutional


investors,
 if
 they're
 not
 actual
 money


managing
 funds,


then
 I'm
 not
 sure
 exactly
 how
 bullish


they
 are.


Oh
 yeah,
 because
 the
 chat
 called
 me
 gay.


Exactly.


That's
 correct.


I'm
 a
 small
 spoon.


Oh
 boy.
 Oh
 boy.
 Oh
 boy.
 Oh
 boy.
 All


right.
 So,
 we
 got
 like
 what?
 Seven
 days


until
 we
 turn
 28.


Tanner
 turned
 28
 10
 days
 before
 me.


We
 got
 seven
 days
 before
 we
 go
 to
 28.


28
 years
 on
 this
 planet.


Yeah,
 princesses
 are
 fashionably
 late.


That's
 also
 fair.


That's
 also
 fair.
 Yo,
 what
 should
 I


dress
 up
 for
 Halloween?
 Is
 there


anything
 reasonable
 to
 dress
 up
 for


Halloween?
 Oh,
 wait.
 It's
 not
 seven


days,
 dude.
 This
 is
 why
 even
 with
 a
 math


teacher,
 I
 suck
 at
 maths
 and
 it's
 four


days.
 I
 am
 so
 bad
 at
 math,
 bro.
 I'm
 like


I
 can
 do
 very
 basic
 like
 adding
 and


subtracting
 and
 even
 then
 I
 kind
 of
 suck


at
 it.
 It
 is
 sad
 though,
 bro,
 because
 my


mom
 taught
 math
 for
 15
 years
 and
 then
 I


get
 to
 like,
 you
 know,
 algebra
 and


geometry
 and
 all
 this
 stuff
 and
 I
 just


like
 suck
 at
 it.
 And
 then
 dude,
 calculus


I
 I
 think
 I
 real
 the
 one
 thing
 I'll
 give


myself
 credit
 for
 is
 in
 college
 I


realized
 that
 I'm
 not
 gonna
 be
 the
 math


guy.
 I'm
 just
 not
 like
 like
 I
 know
 I'm


Indian
 and
 I'm
 supposed
 to
 be
 good
 at


math
 and
 I'm
 supposed
 to
 be
 analytical


and
 I'm
 supposed
 to
 you
 know


uh
 you
 know
 solve
 for
 why
 but
 I'm


curious
 about
 the
 philosophical
 nature


of
 why
 we
 exist
 the
 way
 we
 exist
 not


like
 solving
 for
 y.
 So
 I
 was
 like
 I
 just


I
 don't
 like
 I
 think
 my
 freshman
 year
 I


told
 myself
 like
 dude
 this
 is
 not
 my


[ __ ]
 like
 I'm
 just
 not
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


be
 a
 math
 guy.
 I
 like
 working
 with


numbers
 don't
 get
 me
 wrong.
 I
 like


looking
 through
 valuation
 models,
 all


that
 stuff,
 but
 like
 academic
 math
 is


not
 something
 I
 was
 attracted
 to.
 And


and
 you
 have
 to
 go
 through
 that
 if


you're
 going
 to
 be
 in
 the
 STEM
 world.
 I


mean,
 at least
 to
 an
 extent,
 you
 have
 to


be
 part
 of
 that.
 And
 I
 was
 just
 always


way
 more
 creative.
 Way
 more
 creative.


The
 the
 hard
 part
 about
 being
 creative,


though,
 is
 you
 can't
 make
 money
 if


you're
 creative.
 Like,
 it's
 not
 easy
 to


make
 money
 through
 your
 creativity.


It's
 a
 lot
 easier
 if
 you
 can
 just
 like


head
 down
 focus
 into
 something
 that's


STEM
 and
 make
 although
 ironically
 in
 the


world
 of
 AI
 this
 is
 where
 the
 world
 is


getting
 crazy
 maybe
 it
 is
 easier
 to
 make


money
 if
 you're
 creative
 because
 the
 uh


the
 commoditization
 is
 happening
 towards


the
 the
 academic
 and
 the
 uh
 systemic


parts
 of
 society
 and
 the
 creative
 parts


of
 our
 society
 although
 AI
 is
 trying
 to


go
 after
 them
 AI
 might
 serve
 more
 as
 a


tool
 to
 empower
 the
 creatives
 but
 the


creatives
 genuinely
 are
 the
 things
 that


stand
 out
 in
 a
 world
 of
 fakeness
 and
 you


know
 AI
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 fake
 things
 that


that
 propagate
 itself.
 You
 can't


automate
 music
 as
 we
 were
 talking
 about


a
 couple
 days
 ago.
 Even
 though
 there


will
 be
 a
 ton
 of
 automation
 in
 that


space,
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 you


know,
 you're
 going
 to
 want
 to
 listen
 to


your
 favorite
 artist.


So,
 who
 knows?
 But
 like
 I
 was
 just
 never


a
 math
 guy.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 I
 let
 Vlad


tend
 to
 do
 the
 math.
 Exactly.
 I
 let
 Vlad


do
 the
 math.
 That's
 why
 Vlad's
 special,


bro.
 Vlad
 is
 creative
 and
 he
 can
 do


math.
 When
 you
 can
 do
 both,
 I
 can't
 do


both,
 but
 when
 you
 can
 do
 both,
 you
 can


like


you
 can
 really
 do
 some
 crazy
 [ __ ]


but
 it's
 not
 easy.
 Tess
 says,
 "I'm
 such


a
 geek.
 I
 love
 numbers
 and
 patterns,


trends,
 and
 maths."
 Yeah,
 I
 thought
 I
 I


look,
 I
 was
 a
 geek
 in
 high
 school.
 I
 had


a
 4.2
 GPA.
 I
 was
 absolutely
 a
 geek.


Like,
 I
 got
 all
 my
 work
 done,
 all
 this


[ __ ]
 like
 I
 was
 like
 on
 but
 like
 the


actual
 process
 of
 of
 liking
 what
 I
 was


doing
 when
 it
 came
 to
 things
 like
 math
 I


just
 I
 never
 I
 never
 got
 super
 attached


to
 it
 ever.


But
 there
 are
 some
 people
 that
 that
 love


that
 stuff.


Um


oh
 yeah
 I
 mean
 look
 that's
 a
 good
 point


there.
 There
 are
 creative
 elements
 to


math.
 I
 don't
 mean
 creative
 in
 the
 like


the
 literal
 definition
 of
 creative
 is


not
 what
 I'm
 saying
 because
 like


anything
 could
 be
 classified
 as


creativity,
 right?
 Because
 you're


literally
 creating
 something.
 Someone


who's
 doing
 very
 complex
 PhD
 level
 math


is
 going
 through
 the
 process
 of
 being


creative
 with
 all
 their
 proofs
 and
 all


this
 different
 stuff.
 I
 mean
 more
 so


artistic
 I
 guess
 to
 an
 extent,


you
 know,
 and
 and
 I
 know
 that's
 also


subjective,
 but
 I
 think
 there
 is


somewhat
 of
 a
 fine
 line
 between
 linear


algebra
 versus
 painting.
 Like,
 you
 know,


well,
 you
 could
 argue
 linear
 algebra
 is


artistic,
 but
 I
 think
 most
 people
 would


say
 the
 other
 classifies
 as
 a
 creative


career.


Okay.
 What
 do
 I
 dress
 up
 for
 Halloween?


You
 guys
 are
 saying
 dress
 as
 carp.


I
 don't
 know if
 that's
 going
 to
 work.


I
 want
 something
 that's
 like


I
 want
 something
 like
 different,
 bro.
 I


don't
 want
 just
 something
 with
 a
 t-shirt


and
 like
 I
 want
 I
 don't
 know.


Dresses
 Tanner.


Dude,


Tanner,
 can
 I
 show
 Tanner,
 are
 you
 still


here?
 Can
 I
 show
 them
 the
 thing
 you
 sent


me
 and
 Roy
 yesterday?
 Because
 that
 [ __ ]


is
 crazy.


Let
 me
 know
 if
 I
 can
 show
 this
 because


uh


this
 is
 definitely
 hilarious.


Yo,
 I
 just
 clicked
 on
 the
 picture,


Tanner.
 This
 is
 absolutely
 hilarious.


The
 the
 the
 account
 that
 you
 showed
 me


in
 Roy,
 the
 ex
 account
 that
 you
 showed


me
 in
 Roy


dress
 as
 an
 Indian
 Steve.


Um


you
 can
 show
 it.
 Okay,
 this
 [ __ ]
 was


hilarious,
 bro.
 There's
 an
 AI
 bot
 that's


copying
 Tanner.


Fintech
 law
 man.
 Fintech
 legal
 expert


always
 up
 for
 a
 fintech
 debate
 over
 a


pint.
 Now,
 if
 you
 guys
 have
 not
 seen


Tanner's
 profile
 picture,


this
 is
 Tanner.
 To
 give
 some
 context,


there's
 an
 AI
 bot
 called
 Fintech
 Law


Man,
 which
 I
 mean
 fintech
 Tanner
 is
 the


fintech
 guy,
 right?
 The
 purple


background,


the
 suit
 and
 tie,
 the
 blazer.
 It's
 just


It
 is
 so
 weird,
 bro.


I
 don't
 know
 who
 this
 is.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 they're
 a
 bot,
 if
 they're
 a
 human,


but
 uh
 yeah,
 they're
 they're
 copying


Tanner.
 This
 is
 what
 I
 mean,
 bro,
 by
 AI


potentially
 commoditizing
 creative
 work.


My
 camera
 just
 died.
 You
 might
 have


people
 that
 like
 end
 up
 using
 this
 as


their
 way
 of,


you
 know,
 communicating


other
 people's
 careers.
 It's
 Lor's


husband.
 Exactly.


It's
 freaking
 Lor's
 husband.


Probably
 his
 gay
 stalker.
 Oh
 my
 gosh.


It's
 weird
 though,
 right?
 It's
 so
 weird.


Um,


we
 are
 all
 getting
 way
 in
 the
 weeds.
 AI


has
 already
 solved
 some
 huge
 problems
 in


math
 and
 invented
 new
 antibiotics.
 I


think
 it's
 weird
 how
 fast
 we
 all
 got


used
 to
 it.
 Yeah,
 that's
 fair.
 We
 all


have
 gotten
 super
 used
 to
 AI.
 I
 mean
 AMD


with
 Med
 Medlogics
 today,
 they
 partnered


and
 they
 said
 that
 pre
 uh
 pre-detection


of
 cancer
 in
 certain
 trials
 has
 started


to
 work
 out
 on
 their
 technology
 that


they're
 doing
 in
 collaboration
 with
 AMD.


There's
 so
 many
 things
 that
 AI
 is


already
 making
 so
 much
 progress
 on.
 But


you
 know,
 the
 Wall
 Street
 guys
 like


where's
 the
 ROI?
 Where's
 the
 ROI?
 And


and
 we
 are
 seeing
 some
 really
 good


earnings
 beats
 potentially
 because
 of
 AI


on
 the
 margin
 story.
 I
 think
 everyone's


looking
 for
 that
 massive
 killer


application
 of
 AI,
 which
 is
 why
 we're
 so


impatient
 on
 it.
 But
 it
 is
 changing
 the


world.
 Like,
 dude,
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 I


bought
 Deepseek
 or
 I
 bought
 Nvidia
 so


heavily
 during
 DeepSeek
 is
 I
 talked
 to


one
 of
 my
 friends
 who
 works
 at
 who
 was
 a


he's
 a
 junior
 in
 Berkeley
 and
 I
 hit
 him


up
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Bro,
 like,
 what
 do


you
 think
 about
 Nvidia
 right
 now?"
 I


think
 the
 stock
 was
 at
 like
 110.
 I
 was


like,
 he's
 he's
 one
 of
 the
 smartest
 guys


I
 know
 in
 Berkeley.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Is


Nvidia
 buy
 right
 now?"
 He's
 like, "Dude,


take
 every
 freaking
 dollar
 you
 can
 find


and
 buy
 Nvidia."
 He
 was
 like,
 "At
 least


in
 Berkeley
 in
 California,
 the
 only


thing
 we
 can
 talk
 about
 is
 AI,
 and
 the


only
 way
 you
 get
 AI
 is
 because
 of


Nvidia."


He
 was
 just
 like,
 "I
 don't
 know
 why
 the


market
 is
 being
 so
 stupid,
 but
 if
 you


ask
 me,
 you
 buy
 as
 much
 Nvidia
 as


possible."


And
 I
 said,
 "Okay,
 I'm
 going
 to
 buy."
 I


mean,
 I
 took
 his
 advice,
 I
 took
 Tanner's


advice,
 and
 we
 bought
 more
 Nvidia.


So,
 it
 really
 is
 one
 of
 those
 things


that
 we're
 getting
 used
 to,
 but
 it
 is
 so


special
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 Two
 years


ago,
 every
 normie
 was
 saying
 how
 dumb


picture
 video
 generation
 was,
 and
 they'd


never
 use
 it.
 Now,
 they
 link
 sora
 vids


to
 me.
 Resistance
 is
 futile.
 Yeah,
 100%.


100%.


Do
 you
 think
 Mumani
 is
 winning?
 Yeah,


bro.
 He's
 winning.
 There's
 I
 mean,
 I


looked
 at
 the
 polls.
 This
 is
 not
 me


giving
 my
 political
 opinion.
 Again,
 you


guys
 know
 I
 don't
 care
 about
 politics,


but
 objectively


looking
 at
 the
 poll,
 look
 here,
 here's


here's
 a
 reason
 why
 he's
 winning.
 I


mean,
 this
 is
 just
 one
 of
 those
 things


that


didn't
 uh


didn't
 look
 the
 best
 for
 for
 Quomo.


Um,


but
 they
 asked
 a
 simple
 question.


They
 asked
 a
 simple
 question.
 Let
 me
 put


this
 up
 right
 here.


I
 was
 watching
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 the


debate
 the
 other
 day.


Is
 this
 the
 whole
 debate?


Yeah,
 this
 was
 the
 question.
 Let
 me
 see


if
 I
 can
 pull
 it
 up
 right
 here.
 And


Cuomo
 just
 fumbled
 on
 this
 question,


bro.
 He
 fumbled
 so
 hard
 on
 this


question.
 Like,
 it
 was
 so
 bad.
 Do
 you


guys
 know
 the
 question?


Um,


do
 you
 guys
 know
 the
 qu
 Damn,
 where
 is


this
 clip,
 bro?


Where
 is
 this
 clip?
 Hold
 on.
 Let
 me
 see.


Mannani.


Um,


good.
 You
 would
 think
 I
 would
 get
 this


clip
 from
 here
 on
 YouTube.
 Let
 me
 see
 if


it's
 here.


>> It
 was
 a
 question
 about
 sports
 and
 it


was
 just
 such
 an
 easy
 way
 to
 not
 fumble


the
 Is
 it
 Is
 it
 a
 real
 or
 is
 it
 a
 clip?


Dude,
 why
 am
 I
 showing
 you
 guys
 all


these
 reels
 now?


Damn.
 Where
 is
 the
 freaking
 like,
 how


can
 I
 not
 find
 this?
 Hold
 on.
 Let
 me
 let


me
 search
 it
 up
 right
 here.


Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 find
 it.


Okay,
 I'll
 just
 describe
 it
 if
 I
 can't


find
 the
 video.
 Basically,
 they
 said,


uh,
 who
 who
 if
 the
 Knicks
 are
 in
 game


seven
 or
 if
 the
 Mets
 are
 in
 game
 seven,


who
 are
 you
 watching?
 And
 Mdani
 was


like,
 I'm
 watching
 the
 Knicks.
 And
 then


Cuomo
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 I'll
 I'll
 go
 watch


both."


And
 it
 was
 just
 like,


"What?"


It
 was
 like,
 "What?
 Like,
 like
 just
 just


pick
 a
 side."
 Like,
 and
 and
 then
 Mumani


calls
 him
 out.
 He's
 like, "This
 is
 why


people
 don't
 trust
 you.
 You
 can't
 pick
 a


side.
 You
 don't
 have
 an
 opinion.


Everything
 you
 say
 is
 has
 to
 be


politically
 correct."
 And
 it
 was
 such
 a


good
 moment
 for
 Mumani
 because
 he
 was


just
 like, "Bro,
 like
 you
 really
 can't


say
 like
 just
 be
 a
 normal
 guy.
 Like,


would
 you
 watch
 the
 Knicks
 or
 the
 Mets


if
 you
 were in
 game
 seven?
 It's
 like
 not


that
 hard
 to
 make
 a
 decision
 on
 this."


And
 Cuomo's
 like,
 "Oh,
 yeah.
 I
 would


watch
 both.
 I
 can't
 decide."
 And
 the


whole
 audience
 started
 laughing
 because


they
 were
 like,
 "What
 are
 you
 talking?"


So,
 I
 think
 that
 was
 it
 was
 just
 one
 of


those
 moments
 that
 made
 it
 feel
 like


Do
 I
 have
 it?
 Oh,
 do
 I
 have
 the
 clip?
 I


think
 I
 have
 the
 clip.


Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 have
 the
 clip.
 I
 have
 the


clip.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Here
 it
 is.
 Here
 it


is.
 It's
 on
 Patrick
 Bed
 David.
 He
 He


covered
 this.


>> Yeah.
 Play
 this
 clip.
 It's
 a
 37
 second


clip.
 Go
 ahead,
 Rob.


>> Possible,
 but
 the
 Mets
 are
 playing
 game


seven
 of
 the
 World
 Series
 on
 the
 same


night
 as
 the
 Knicks
 are
 playing
 game


seven
 of
 the
 NBA
 championship.
 And
 you


can
 only
 go
 to
 one.
 Which
 one
 will
 it


be,
 Mr.
 Slew?
 Again,
 which
 baseball


team?
 This
 is
 the
 Mets
 game
 seven.


Knicks
 game
 seven
 even.


>> Uh,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 the
 Mets
 game.
 I'm


a
 Yankee
 fan.
 True
 baseball
 fans
 either


like
 one
 or
 the
 other.
 I'm
 going
 to
 the


Knicks
 game.
 That's
 my
 team,
 the
 Knicks.


>> Mr.
 Quo,


I'm
 going
 to
 go
 half
 and
 half.
 I
 can


make
 it
 back
 and
 forth.


>> All right.
 And
 Mr.
 Ramdani,


>> this
 is
 what
 New
 York
 is
 a
 sick
 of.
 Just


pick
 a
 team.
 Come
 on.
 I'd
 be
 there
 for


the
 Knicks.


>> Okay.


>> Okay.
 Can
 you
 go
 back
 to
 the
 5-second?


And
 I
 I
 I


>> mean,
 even
 I
 saw
 that
 and
 I'm
 like,
 bro,


like
 this
 is
 why
 you're
 not
 that


approachable
 to
 me.
 Like
 just


objectively,
 this
 is
 why
 a
 lot
 of
 New


Yorkers
 want
 to
 change.
 Like
 he's
 not


personable.
 Just
 say
 which
 team
 you


would
 watch.
 So
 look,
 objectively,
 I


think
 Mumani
 is
 going
 to
 win.
 The
 polls


have
 him
 at
 like
 85
 to
 90%.
 I
 don't
 live


in
 New
 York.
 I
 live
 close
 to
 New
 York.
 I


don't
 live
 in
 New
 York.
 So,
 I'm
 not


voting.
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 vote.
 And


I
 don't
 know
 how
 much
 New
 Jersey
 is


going
 to
 be
 affected
 by
 it.
 I
 mean,
 I'm


sure
 there'll
 be
 some
 ways
 we're


affected,
 but
 this
 is
 more
 so
 in
 New


York,
 I
 think,
 more
 than
 Jersey.


It's
 New
 York.
 They
 want
 a
 straight


shooter.
 Yeah,
 exactly,
 dude.
 They
 want


a
 straight
 shooter.
 Dude,
 Mannani
 did
 a


flagrant.
 He
 did
 a
 flavor
 with
 Andrew


Scholes,
 which
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 runchy


comedy
 podcast.


And
 I
 I
 I
 thought
 the
 podcast
 went


pretty
 well.
 I
 mean,
 he
 he
 sounded
 like


a
 normal
 human
 on
 the
 podcast,
 made
 a


lot
 of
 jokes,
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 fun.


At
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 I
 think
 he's


probably
 going
 to
 win.


Chris
 is
 in
 Texas
 today.
 He
 couldn't


make
 today.
 He's
 in
 New
 York
 or
 not
 New


York,
 he's
 in
 Houston,


so


he
 couldn't
 make
 it
 for
 for
 this
 week.


Um,


Random
 Shark,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super


chat.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here,
 Emit.


Random
 Shark,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here


as
 well.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 $10
 super


chat.
 Leon,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super


chat.
 Which
 would
 you
 hold
 through


earnings?
 Amazon,
 Google,
 or
 Nvidia?


It's
 a
 good
 question.


Oh,
 that's
 a
 hard
 one.
 I
 feel
 like
 the


answer
 is
 all
 three.
 I
 just
 pulled
 a


Quomo.


I
 just
 pulled
 a
 Quomo.
 I
 said,
 well,
 I


could
 hold
 all
 three,
 right?
 Why
 not?


Like,
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 make
 a
 decision


here.


Damn,
 that's
 a
 straightup
 Cuomo.


It's
 a
 straight
 up
 CMO.


I
 feel
 like
 I
 would
 pick
 Nvidia.


Although,
 I
 feel
 like
 Amazon
 and
 Google


are
 going to
 be
 fine,
 dude.
 I
 just
 feel


like
 Nvidia
 was
 at
 195.
 Amazon
 Google's


at
 all-time
 highs,
 so
 they
 have
 to
 be


really
 good.
 Nvidia
 has
 some
 room
 to


move
 up.
 Amazon,
 if
 they
 have
 bad
 AWS


numbers,
 that
 shit's
 going
 down.
 Like,


it's
 just
 call
 spade
 a
 spade.
 So,
 I'd


pick
 Nvidia.


But
 I
 would
 hold
 all
 three.


Real
 New
 Yorkers

 in

 Do
 you


think
 Mani
 is
 going to
 f
 up
 New
 York?
 I


have
 no
 idea.
 I
 have
 no
 idea.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 his
 policies
 are
 going
 to
 go


through.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 any
 of
 the


policies
 are
 going
 to
 be
 successful
 if


they
 do
 go
 through.
 A
 lot
 of
 the


fighting
 he's
 going to
 have
 to
 do
 is


with
 Al
 Albany
 and,
 you
 know,
 upstate


New
 York
 more
 than
 the
 White
 House.
 What


if
 Trump
 actually
 stops
 giving
 New
 York


a
 bunch
 of
 federal
 funds?
 Like,
 there's


so
 many
 variables
 to
 it.
 I
 don't
 know


but
 we
 are
 going
 to
 track
 it
 over
 the


next
 coming
 years
 and
 see
 if
 there
 is


any
 upwards
 or
 downwards
 progress


in
 uh
 in
 New
 York.


Richard
 said,
 "Thanks.
 I
 just
 put
 5K
 on


Mum
 Donnie."


I
 mean,
 look,
 the
 polls
 show
 me
 that


he's
 likely
 going
 to
 win.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 he
 will,
 but
 the
 polls
 feel
 like
 it's


going
 to
 be
 more
 likely.
 Dude,
 the
 NBA


scandal
 is
 crazy.


the
 NBA
 scandal.
 That
 [ __ ]
 is
 insane.


Chanty
 Bill,
 there
 was
 a
 coach
 who
 got


arrested
 today


and
 then
 there
 was
 a
 freaking
 player,


Terrence
 Rosier,
 I
 think,
 who
 got


arrested
 after
 playing
 last
 night.
 A


coach
 got
 arrested
 today
 and
 a
 player


got
 arrested
 today
 at
 6
 a.m.
 in
 Miami


because
 both
 of
 them
 were
 caught
 up
 in


this
 controversy
 of
 uh
 of
 of
 gambling


and
 like
 fixing
 games
 and
 [ __ ]


like
 it's
 actually
 wild.
 Here's
 the


update
 on
 this
 for
 those
 that
 that


didn't
 hear
 about
 this
 today.


>> Things
 that
 we
 should
 take
 a
 look
 at
 are


the
 illegal
 gambling
 and
 the
 poker


betting
 that
 we
 were
 just
 hearing
 about


with
 Chanty
 Bilips
 and
 Terry
 Roier.
 What


were
 your
 takeaways
 that
 you
 just
 heard?


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 look
 back
 at
 the
 Jonte
 Porter


scandal.
 There
 was
 some
 hope.
 I
 think


that
 this
 was
 an
 isolated
 incident.
 It


was
 a
 two-way
 player,
 somebody
 who


hadn't
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 playing
 in


the
 NBA.
 Maybe
 he
 was
 vulnerable,
 but
 it


wasn't,
 say,
 a
 widespread
 problem.
 Terry


Rosir
 has
 made
 $160
 million
 playing
 in


the
 NBA.
 If
 he's
 vulnerable
 to
 a
 scandal


like
 this,
 that
 raises
 a
 lot
 of


questions
 that
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 NBA
 has


good
 answers
 for.
 I
 think
 this
 is


probably
 the
 most
 significant
 gambling


scandal
 the
 NBA
 has
 faced
 yet.
 the
 hope


and
 I
 mean
 with
 multiple
 you
 know


between
 Chanty
 Bilips
 who
 I
 guess
 is
 in


a
 different
 with
 the
 poker
 investigation


getting
 investigated
 for
 different


things
 but
 between
 Chanty
 Bilips
 and


Damon
 Jones
 and
 Terry
 Rosier
 this
 is


much
 more
 significant
 than
 just
 a
 single


player
 like
 was
 the
 case
 with
 Jonte


Porter
 it's
 the
 most
 significant
 game
 by


the
 way
 Chanty
 Bilips


his
 [ __ ]
 goes
 deeper
 he's
 with
 the
 mafia


he
 apparently


owed
 money
 and
 was
 gambling
 ling
 in


poker
 games
 with
 the
 mafia.


Like
 that's
 how
 wild
 this
 was.
 Here,


here's
 another
 update
 on
 it.
 But
 it's


like
 I
 just
 could
 not
 believe


that
 an
 active
 player
 and
 an
 active


coach
 are
 that
 deep
 into
 this.


>> Joining
 NBA
 today,
 ABC
 News
 chief


investigative
 correspondent
 Aaron


Kurski.
 Aaron,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


staying
 with
 us
 here
 on
 NBA
 Today.
 What


>> here
 in
 Manhattan?
 So
 they
 would
 gamble,


so
 they
 would
 play
 poker.
 What
 those


people
 didn't
 know
 was
 that
 everyone


else
 at
 the
 table
 was
 in
 on
 the
 scam


because
 the
 games
 were
 rigged.
 Chanty


Bilips
 was
 known
 as
 a
 face
 card
 because


the
 mafia
 allegedly
 used
 his
 face
 to


lure
 in
 these
 unsuspecting
 victims.
 The


victims
 themselves
 were
 called
 fish.
 As


the
 US
 attorney
 for
 the
 Eastern
 District


of
 New
 York
 explained
 in
 Brooklyn
 a


short
 while
 ago,


>> the
 scheme
 targeted
 victims
 known
 as


quote
 fish
 who
 were
 often
 lured
 to


participate
 in
 these
 rigged
 games
 by
 the


chance
 to
 play
 alongside


former
 professional
 athletes
 who
 were


known
 as
 quote
 face
 cards.


The
 so-called
 face
 cards
 included
 the


defendant
 Chanty
 Bilips,
 who
 at
 the
 time


of
 the
 scheme
 was
 a
 former
 NBA
 player


and
 is
 currently
 the
 head
 coach
 of
 the


Portland
 Trailblazers.


And
 also
 Damon
 Jones,
 a
 former
 NBA


player
 and
 coach.


What
 the
 victims,
 the
 fish,
 didn't
 know


that
 everybody
 else
 at
 the
 poker
 game,


from
 the
 dealer
 to
 the
 players,


including
 the
 face
 cards,
 were
 in
 on
 the


scam.
 For
 example,
 they
 used


offthe-shelf
 shuffling
 machines
 that
 had


been
 secretly
 altered
 in
 order
 to
 read


the
 cards
 in
 the
 deck,
 predict
 which


player
 at
 the
 table
 had
 the
 best
 poker


hand,
 and
 relay
 that
 information
 to
 an


off-site
 operator.


>> These
 rigged
 poker
 games
 have
 been
 going


on,
 prosecutors
 say,
 since
 at
 least


2019.
 And
 it
 involved
 these
 altered


shuffling
 decks,
 X-ray
 poker
 tables
 that


could
 read
 cards
 that
 were
 face
 down.


There
 were
 special
 glasses
 and
 contact


lenses
 that
 enabled
 players
 in
 on
 the


scam
 to
 know
 what
 the
 victim's
 cards


were
 and
 other
 technology
 brought
 to


bear.
 The
 victim
 Chennet
 had
 no
 chance


at
 winning
 these
 games.
 They
 lost


millions
 of
 dollars.
 And
 since
 the
 mob


was
 involved,
 prosecutors
 say
 if
 the


victims
 couldn't
 or
 wouldn't
 pay,
 that's


when
 violence
 was
 used
 uh
 to
 make
 sure


they
 did.


>> Thank
 you.


>> I
 cannot
 wait
 to
 get
 Steve's
 take
 on


this.
 The
 mafia
 was
 involved,
 bro.
 X-ray


see-through
 tables.


These
 are
 supposed
 to
 be
 pretty
 wealthy


basketball
 players.
 Like
 maybe
 they're


not
 billionaires,
 but
 it's
 not
 like


they're
 struggling
 and
 they
 have
 to.


They're
 not
 in
 freaking
 rounders
 trying


to
 pay
 for
 law
 school.


You
 like
 that
 movie
 knowledge,
 right?


You
 like
 that
 movie
 knowledge.
 There
 you


go.
 Your
 boy
 knows
 some
 stuff
 about
 pop


culture.
 It
 was
 law
 school,
 right?
 It


was
 law
 school,
 right?
 Was
 it
 med
 school


or
 law
 school?
 Was
 the
 guy
 in
 Rounders


paying
 for
 law
 school?
 It
 definitely
 was


law
 school.
 But
 that's
 wild.
 Yeah,
 it


was
 law
 school.
 It
 was
 freaking
 law


school.
 Thank
 goodness.
 Um,


but
 so
 the
 fact
 that
 they
 were
 gambling


for
 that
 type
 of
 money
 when
 they


probably
 didn't
 need
 to
 just
 shows
 how


much
 greed
 was
 involved,
 right?


Shows
 how
 much
 greed
 was
 involved.
 Oh


yeah,
 we
 got
 to
 give
 Steve
 some
 [ __ ]
 for


this,
 bro.
 If
 the
 mafia
 knew,
 then
 Steve


knew.
 If
 we
 if if
 we
 got
 to
 give
 Steve


some
 [ __ ]
 for
 this
 one.
 We
 know
 Steve's


an
 Italian
 mob
 boss,
 bro.


That's
 basically
 That's
 basically
 his


past
 life.


It's
 wild,
 bro.
 People
 are
 so
 greedy.


Like
 people
 like


people
 try
 to
 find
 the
 easy
 way
 to
 make


money
 so
 many
 times
 and
 it
 usually


doesn't
 work
 out.


It
 usually
 doesn't
 work.


I
 did
 think
 the
 mob
 was
 not
 a
 thing


anymore.
 I
 did
 think
 the
 mafia
 wasn't


out
 there.
 I
 guess
 they
 still
 are.


And
 now
 they're
 here.


Like,
 bro,
 like
 I
 just
 like
 just
 even


the
 thought
 of
 being
 at
 a
 casino
 and


trying
 to
 cheat.
 Like,
 is
 it
 really


worth
 it,
 bro?
 Is
 it
 really?
 Especially


if
 you
 get
 caught.
 Like,
 that
 [ __ ]
 is


not
 a
 joke.
 Don't
 mess
 around
 with
 that


stuff.


Just
 feel
 like
 it
 is
 not
 worth
 going


through
 all
 that.

Yeah,
 there's

stuff
 involved
 in
 that
 as
 well.
 Siege,


thank
 you
 for
 the
 $10
 super
 chat.


Appreciate
 you,
 man.
 Or
 20
 bucks.
 You
 do


not
 have
 to
 keep
 sending
 these
 20.
 Guys,


can
 we
 can
 we
 make
 a
 pact
 right
 now?
 I'm


saying
 this
 right
 now
 because
 I
 really


don't
 want
 this
 to
 happen.
 Can
 we
 please


make
 sure
 on
 my
 birthday
 people
 don't


send
 super
 chats
 saying
 happy
 birthday


because
 really,
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 do


that.
 And
 I
 know
 people
 are
 going
 to


want
 to
 do
 that.
 We
 really
 don't
 need


to.
 It
 is
 my
 birthday.
 I
 appreciate


everyone
 being
 there.
 I
 should
 be
 giving


back
 to
 you
 guys.
 You
 should
 not
 be


paying
 me
 or
 giving
 any
 super
 chats
 on


my
 birthday
 because
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 turn


it
 into
 when
 we
 hit
 100,000
 subscribers


and
 for
 freaking
 three
 hours
 there
 was


super
 chat
 on
 top
 of
 super
 chat
 on
 top


of
 super
 chat.
 Like,
 you
 don't
 need
 to


do
 that.
 You
 really
 don't
 need
 to
 do


that.


And
 I
 know
 me
 saying
 this
 means
 people


are
 going to
 do
 it
 more,
 but
 I'm
 like


I'm
 saying
 this
 like
 with
 like
 I'm
 legit


trying
 to
 be
 genuine
 and
 I
 don't
 want
 to


sit
 there
 for
 three
 hours
 reading
 a


happy
 birthday
 super
 chat
 taking
 your


money
 just
 because
 it's
 my
 birthday.


Like
 we
 don't
 need
 to
 do
 that.
 It's
 we


can
 have
 a
 fun
 time
 on
 my
 birthday.
 We


can
 cover
 the
 markets.
 We
 can
 talk.


But
 it
 doesn't
 I
 didn't
 think
 it
 would


be
 as
 aggressive
 as
 it
 was
 on
 the


100,000
 celebration.
 But
 it
 was
 like
 I


think
 it
 was
 legit
 300
 super
 chats.
 It


was
 a
 bit
 insane.
 And
 so
 we
 really


Dude,
 I'm
 about
 to
 leave
 early
 if
 you


guys
 start
 doing
 this
 [ __ ]
 right
 now.


Shm
 pasta,
 thank
 you.
 Spencer,
 thank


you.
 But
 like
 legit,
 bro.
 Like
 it's
 just


not


Let's
 not
 do
 that.
 Like,
 buy
 some
 Grab


instead.
 Pump
 the
 freaking
 bags.
 Let's


Let's
 do
 that
 instead.


Let's
 do
 that
 instead.


Do
 super
 chats
 the
 day
 before.
 Well,


it's
 a
 Sunday
 that
 day.
 So,
 Oh,
 no.
 We


do
 have
 a
 future
 stream.


We
 do
 have
 a
 future
 stream.


Uh,
 Sarth
 had
 a
 super
 chat.
 Did
 you
 have


a
 super
 chat,
 Sarth?
 Uh,
 what
 to
 do
 in


New
 York?
 I'm
 here
 for
 vacay.
 I'm
 from


Singapore.
 Is
 this
 your
 first
 time
 in


New
 York?
 Is
 this
 your
 first
 time
 in
 New


York?


All
 right.
 Who's
 in
 New
 York
 in
 the


chat?
 What
 does
 Sarth
 do?
 I
 would
 say


you
 should
 definitely
 go
 to
 the


financial
 district.
 You
 should
 go
 to


Harry's
 steakhouse
 if
 you're
 into
 steak


in
 the
 financial
 district.
 Um,


you
 should
 definitely
 go
 to
 Times
 Square


if
 it's
 your
 first
 time
 in
 New
 York.


Even
 though
 Times
 Square
 is
 overrated,


but
 still.


Um,
 yeah,
 first
 time.
 Oh,
 dude.
 You
 got


to
 do
 everything
 then.
 If
 it's
 your


first
 time,
 you
 got
 to
 go
 get
 pizza.


John's
 on
 Bleecker
 Street.
 You
 gotta
 go


to
 Brooklyn.
 You
 gotta
 go
 to
 freaking


You
 gotta
 go
 to
 Brooklyn
 Bridge.
 You


gotta
 go
 Time
 Square.


There's,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 really
 I
 I
 I


don't
 know
 if
 I
 will
 ever
 get
 to
 this


type
 of
 wealth
 in
 my
 life,
 but
 if
 I
 ever


have
 FU
 money,
 like
 real
 FU
 money,
 I


would
 like
 to
 own
 an
 apartment


overlooking
 Central
 Park.
 And
 we're


talking
 about
 like
 real
 real
 fu
 money


because
 that
 that
 is
 not
 an
 easy
 task
 to


to
 do.
 But
 Central
 Park
 to
 me
 is
 one
 of


the
 most
 beautiful
 parts
 of
 New
 York


City.
 And
 for
 those
 that
 haven't
 ever


seen
 Central
 Park,
 absolutely
 gorgeous.


The
 view
 from
 the
 top
 of
 this
 place
 is


amazing.


And
 I
 just
 love
 this
 spot.
 In
 fact,


one
 of
 the
 first
 dates
 I
 ever
 went
 on


back
 in
 high
 school
 was
 in
 Central
 Park.


We
 watched
 a
 movie
 in
 New
 York.
 We
 went


to
 uh
 Damn,
 the
 restaurant
 is
 still


there.
 I
 saw
 it
 the
 other
 day.
 It's
 it's


it's
 a
 sushi
 spot.
 I
 think
 it's
 near


38th
 Street.


And
 then
 we
 walked
 around
 Central
 Park.


We
 walked
 around
 Central
 Park.
 Really?


It
 was
 It
 was
 This
 was
 This
 was
 back
 in


freaking
 This
 was
 20


2014.
 It
 was
 a
 junior.
 The
 junior
 in


high
 school.
 Yeah,
 I
 was
 a
 junior
 in


high
 school.
 This,
 you
 know,
 you
 know,
 I


This
 was
 December
 20.
 This
 is
 the
 day


after
 Christmas.
 It's
 the
 day
 after


Christmas
 back
 in
 2014.
 December
 26th.


The
 movie
 we
 was
 some
 Disney
 [ __ ]
 Um,


uh,
 Into
 the
 Woods.
 Into
 the
 woods.
 It


was
 this
 [ __ ]
 Into
 Do
 you
 guys
 remember


this
 movie?
 Into
 the
 Woods.
 Yep.
 It
 came


out.
 Look
 at
 this.
 I
 It
 literally
 came


out
 December
 25th,
 2014.
 And
 we
 watched


it
 December
 26th.
 I
 remember
 this.


Your
 boy
 wasn't
 really
 watching
 the


movie
 though,
 if
 you
 know
 what
 I'm


talking
 about.
 That
 was
 That
 was
 a
 fun


date.
 That
 was
 a
 That's
 how
 I
 knew
 it


was
 a
 real
 date.
 Like
 at
 first
 I
 was


like, "Oh,
 it's
 a
 movie.
 You
 know,
 we


want
 to
 go."
 Then
 at
 the
 then
 I
 realized


if
 I
 don't
 remember
 what
 the
 movie's


about
 because
 it
 was
 a
 bit
 preoccupied


during
 the
 movie
 that
 it
 was
 a
 real


date.
 So
 and
 then
 we
 walked
 around


Central
 Park
 and
 it
 was
 gorgeous.
 Dude,


we
 stayed
 there
 till
 like
 10
 o'clock
 at


night.
 Like
 it
 was
 great,
 dude.
 That
 was


the
 best
 part
 about
 living
 in
 New
 Jersey


growing
 up
 is
 that
 you
 have
 access
 to


the
 city.
 You
 have
 access
 to
 freaking


New
 York.
 Like
 this
 place
 is
 beautiful.


And
 I
 live
 like
 a
 30
 minute
 train
 ride


away.


is
 is
 one
 of
 the
 things
 on
 the
 and
 now
 I


I
 I
 live
 basically
 a
 15inut
 train
 ride


away
 which
 is
 so
 cool


in
 in
 the
 context
 of
 New
 York.
 So
 I


would
 say
 go
 to
 Central
 Park.
 I
 would


say
 go
 to
 Central
 Park.


What
 was
 his
 name?
 You
 guys
 can
 keep


saying
 it,
 but
 it
 was
 like
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 know
 what
 you
 want
 me
 to
 tell
 you.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 you
 want
 me
 to
 tell


you.


No,
 it
 was
 fun,
 dude.
 It
 was
 a
 real
 It


was
 my
 first
 like
 uh
 I
 think
 it
 was
 my


first
 like
 real
 legit
 date.


Like


Yeah,
 it
 was
 like
 my
 first
 like
 cuz
 I
 I


ended
 up
 that
 girl
 ended
 up
 being
 my


girlfriend
 a
 year
 later.


That
 was
 my
 first
 like
 real
 legit
 date.


Was
 her
 name
 Lori?


Yeah,
 it
 might
 have
 been
 Lori.
 It
 might


have
 been
 Lori.
 Michelle,
 thank
 you
 for


the
 super
 chat.
 I
 appreciate
 it.
 Happy


early
 birthday,
 Mid.
 Buy
 yourself
 a


mocktail.
 I
 will
 absolutely
 buy
 myself
 a


mocktail.
 Thank

 And

 Happy

 more
 B&men.
 I


will
 have
 to
 I
 bought
 a
 little
 bit
 when


it
 hit
 49.50


last
 week
 on
 Friday.
 So
 I
 bought
 a


little
 bit
 but
 thank
 you
 sir
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 happy


birthday
 guys.
 Again
 please
 I
 really
 I


really
 on
 my
 birthday
 I
 I
 don't
 on
 on
 a


day
 where
 it's
 your
 birthday
 at least
 in


my
 culture
 you
 give
 back.
 So
 I
 really
 do


not
 want
 to
 take
 people's
 money.
 I
 just


want
 it
 to
 be
 a
 fun
 time
 and
 I
 don't


want
 to
 I
 don't
 want
 people
 to
 feel


compelled
 that
 they
 have
 to
 give
 back
 or


give
 me
 a
 gift
 because
 it's
 my
 birthday


and
 do
 it
 through
 a
 super
 chat.
 I
 really


do
 not
 want
 that
 to
 happen.
 But
 I
 will


be
 doing
 a
 giveaway
 and
 we'll
 do
 some


fun
 stuff
 this
 time
 for
 a
 giveaway.


Okay,
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 guys
 a
 question.


Should
 I
 should
 I
 give
 away
 like
 a,000


bucks
 cash?
 We
 have
 10
 people
 win
 100


bucks.
 Or
 should
 I
 buy
 two
 $500
 gadgets


and
 give
 away
 two
 of
 those
 gadgets?
 What


would
 be
 better?


either
 two
 $500
 gadgets
 or


or
 freaking
 uh
 or
 just
 like
 the
 $100


cash.


What
 do
 we
 think?
 Do
 we
 do
 we
 give
 away


some
 gold?


Lambo
 giveaway.
 We're
 not
 at
 that
 level


yet.


Dude,
 the
 stock
 certification
 is


actually
 a
 good
 idea.


I
 would
 have
 to
 get
 your
 shipping
 info,


but
 then
 I
 could
 ship
 you
 like
 like
 the


Robin
 Hood
 one
 that
 Tess
 gave
 or
 the


Pounder
 one.
 I
 could
 I
 could
 ship
 those


out
 to
 people
 and
 it
 would
 be
 the
 same


cost.
 It'
 be
 like
 100
 150
 bucks.
 That


would
 actually
 be
 a
 cool
 idea.


And
 you
 could
 tell
 me
 whatever
 share
 you


want.


You
 could
 tell
 me
 whatever
 share
 you


want
 and
 I
 could


Do
 you
 want
 to
 do
 that?
 Do
 we
 Do
 we
 want


to
 do
 that?


>> What's
 the
 website?
 I
 think
 it's
 called


give
 ashare.com.


Yeah,
 dude.
 Maybe
 we
 do
 this.
 You're


You're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 it
 for
 a
 couple


weeks
 because
 it's
 gonna
 take
 some
 time.


This
 would
 actually
 be
 cooler
 than
 just


cash,
 right?


I
 feel
 like
 this
 be
 All right,
 we're


going
 to
 do
 this.
 So,
 if
 you
 win,
 I'll


get
 in
 contact
 with
 you.
 I'm
 going
 to


make
 a
 new
 email,
 by
 the
 way.
 I'm
 gonna


make
 an
 email
 that's
 just
 for
 people


that
 want
 to
 get
 in
 contact
 because


right
 now
 I
 have
 too
 many
 distributed


sources
 for
 like
 people
 to
 contact
 me,


whether
 it's
 Twitter
 or
 a
 couple
 other


emails.
 So,
 I'm
 gonna
 make
 one
 email


that's
 like
 dedicated
 to
 the
 YouTube


channel
 so
 that
 I
 can
 actually
 check
 and


see
 all
 the
 emails
 and
 I'll
 use
 that


email
 to
 communicate
 with
 the
 winners


and
 then
 whatever.
 Okay,
 like
 we'll


we'll
 try
 to
 keep
 the
 stock
 at
 like
 a


hundred
 bucks
 or
 lower
 because


technically
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 shipping


fees.
 So,
 we'll
 try
 to
 What's
 a
 $100
 or


lower
 stock
 that
 everyone
 would
 want?


Like,
 I
 can't
 buy
 everyone
 a
 share
 of


Tesla.
 That's
 like


everyone
 get
 access.
 I
 just
 realized.


Wait
 a
 second.
 I
 can't.
 There
 has
 to
 be


some
 limit
 on
 this.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 we
 can


ship
 outside
 the
 USA.
 I
 think
 so.
 Yeah.


Birkshire
 class
 A.
 Oh,
 wow.
 Grab.
 Yeah.


Why
 don't
 I


something
 that's
 like
 50
 to
 100
 bucks?


SoFi.
 What
 about
 SoFi?
 That's
 perfect.


We'll
 do
 SoFi.
 Everyone
 here
 likes
 SoFi,


right?


Okay.
 I'll
 pick
 a
 list
 of
 10
 stocks
 and


then
 we'll
 just
 we'll
 I
 it'll
 be
 those


10
 are
 the
 options.
 SoFi,


as
 ESTS,
 I
 mean,
 at least
 anything


that's
 under
 100.


Grab
 if
 you
 want,
 but


I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know if
 I
 can
 get
 multip


like
 could
 I
 get
 10
 shares
 of
 Grab


inside
 one
 certificate?
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


got
 to
 see.
 I
 got
 to
 see
 if
 I
 can
 do


that.


Maybe
 something
 like
 that.


If
 it's
 under
 100,
 then
 whatever
 stock


anyone
 wants,
 we'll
 we'll
 do
 that
 route.


Check
 first.
 You
 can't
 get
 most
 of
 those


shares.
 Let's
 go
 to
 the
 website.
 Let's


look
 at
 the
 website
 together.
 So,
 let's


see
 if
 I
 want
 to
 get
 uh


one
 share
 plus
 stock
 certificate.


Okay.


Uh
 what
 if
 like
 Amcore?
 Is
 Amcore
 there?


Yeah,
 there's
 no
 way.
 What
 about
 [ __ ]


They're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 any
 of
 those


names.
 What
 about
 SoFi?


Bro,
 they
 don't
 have
 SoFi.


No.


How
 do
 you
 not
 have
 SoFi?


They
 don't
 freaking
 have
 SoFi.
 They
 have


Apple,


bro.
 Apple's
 350
 bucks.


Okay,
 we're
 gonna
 have
 to
 figure
 out


this
 idea.
 This
 obviously
 a
 little
 bit


more
 aggressive
 than
 I
 thought.


I
 don't
 know.
 We'll
 figure
 it
 out.
 A
 lot


of
 these
 companies
 are
 boring
 though,


bro.
 Like,
 no
 one's
 going
 to
 want
 to


share
 a
 freaking


Maybe
 now
 people.
 But
 look,
 Intel
 costs


84
 bucks.
 It's
 double
 the
 price
 of


Intel.
 Yeah,
 we
 might
 just
 have
 to
 give


cash,
 guys.
 This
 might
 be
 a
 little
 too


complicated.


All right,
 we'll
 just
 do
 a
 100
 bucks


cash.
 People
 can
 do
 whatever
 you
 want


with
 the
 cash.
 That's
 easier.
 This
 is


going
 to
 be
 way
 too
 way
 too
 complicated


shipping
 all
 this
 stuff
 out,
 especially


if
 they
 don't
 even
 have
 the
 right
 names.


All right,
 cool.
 So,
 we'll
 do
 the
 cash,


but


that's
 what
 we
 got.


Uh,
 Cactus,
 thank
 you,
 brother.
 You


definitely
 do
 not
 have
 to
 send
 a
 super


chat.
 Happy
 birthday.
 Give
 me
 the


hundred.
 Dude,
 Cactus
 has
 been
 doing


great.
 Cactus
 has
 been
 doing
 freaking


awesome.
 And
 uh
 I'm
 very
 happy
 we


brought
 him
 on
 board
 and
 yeah,
 I
 think


it's
 going
 to
 help
 make
 it
 a
 lot
 more


efficient
 to
 get
 this
 news
 out
 every


single
 day.
 It
 is
 nice
 to
 have
 some


help.
 By
 the
 way,
 that
 person
 I
 told
 you


guys
 that
 I
 was
 thinking
 of
 partnering


with
 for
 the
 like
 management
 of
 the


meetups,
 um
 I
 think
 is
 more
 likely
 to


happen.
 We
 have
 a
 meeting
 in
 another


like
 a
 follow-up
 meeting
 in
 in
 a
 week.


Um


and
 so
 yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 that's


going
 to
 happen.
 And
 I'm
 really
 excited


about
 that
 because
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 of


ideas.
 They
 followed
 up
 from
 the


previous
 meeting
 with
 like
 the
 minutes


of
 our
 conversation.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Damn,


bro.
 Got
 some
 minutes
 in
 this."
 Like


like
 there's
 like
 some
 dedication,
 like


a
 summary
 of
 the
 conversation,
 some


notes.
 I'm
 like, "Bro,
 this
 is
 what
 I


need
 in
 my
 life.
 I
 need
 some
 minutes.


I
 need
 someone
 who
 can
 give
 me
 some


notes
 on
 shit."


So,
 yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 that's
 going


to
 work
 out


and
 it
 should
 be
 fun.


But
 that's
 what
 we
 got.


Tanner
 is
 asking
 himself
 the
 same


question
 on
 his
 stock
 picks.
 Dude,


whenever
 Tanner
 started
 that
 YouTube


portfolio
 thing.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 he


asked
 me
 for
 my
 advice.
 He's
 like, "You


think
 it's a
 good
 idea?"
 I
 was like,


"Yeah,
 it's
 a
 great
 idea."
 And
 then
 we


both
 realized
 people
 are
 going
 to
 send


super
 chats
 of
 like
 any
 freaking
 stock.


And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Well,
 you
 took
 one
 for


the
 team
 because
 I'm
 not
 doing
 that


[ __ ]
 I'm
 not
 doing
 that
 [ __ ]
 anymore."


Someone
 made
 him
 buy
 so
 much
 SBET.
 He's


down
 like
 60%
 on
 this
 SBET.
 By
 the
 way,


Tanner
 doesn't
 even
 get
 all
 the
 money.


YouTube
 takes
 half
 of
 that.
 And
 then


Tanner
 has
 to
 pay
 taxes
 on
 the
 other


half
 that
 he
 keeps.
 And
 that's
 in


Canada.
 So
 you're
 basically
 giving
 away


99.999%


of
 every
 dollar.
 So
 basically
 Tanner's


just
 willingly
 giving
 up
 his
 own
 money


for
 the
 super
 chats
 that
 he's
 getting
 to


buy
 these
 stocks
 in
 this
 portfolio.


And
 some
 of
 these
 stocks
 have
 not
 done


the
 best.


Now,
 there
 are
 others
 that
 have
 done


really
 well,
 but
 it's
 definitely
 a


little
 hard
 to
 to
 manage
 that
 whole


thing.


Um,
 but
 we'll
 still
 we'll
 still
 do
 that


giveaway.
 Yo,
 Spencer,
 stop
 freaking


spamming,
 bro.
 Can
 we
 get
 a
 mod
 to


banner?
 Goodness
 gracious.


Happy
 birthday.
 Sorry
 that
 you're
 Okay,


I
 bet
 you
 it's
 going to
 say
 gay
 next.


How
 many
 super?
 2
 4
 6
 812.


All right,
 she's
 spending
 $20
 to
 spam.


Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 There's
 the
 gay.


There
 it
 is.
 There's
 the
 gay.
 Thank
 you,


Spencer.
 I
 appreciate
 it.
 Ray,
 Michelle,


can
 we
 like
 can
 we
 can
 you
 guys
 use
 your


powers
 a
 little
 bit
 here?


Can
 you
 use
 some
 of
 your
 powers?


Dude,
 28,
 huh?
 That's
 going
 to
 be
 crazy.


I'm
 not
 the
 best
 at
 math,
 but
 28
 is
 two


away
 from
 30.
 And
 30
 is
 wild,
 bro.
 30
 is


crazy.
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 here
 are


older
 than
 30,
 but
 I'm
 just
 saying
 that


that
 that
 idea
 of
 30
 year,
 dude.
 Look,


let
 me
 show
 see
 like
 let
 me
 let
 me
 see.


My
 mom's
 getting
 emotional
 that
 I'm


getting
 older
 as
 well.


I
 told
 you
 guys
 I
 was
 going
 to
 show
 you


some
 more
 pictures.
 This
 is
 what
 she


sent
 me
 the
 other
 day.


So,
 when
 I
 was
 a
 kid,
 this
 is
 not
 going


to
 help
 me
 beat
 the
 allegations.
 It's


not
 going
 to
 help
 me
 beat
 the


allegations,
 but
 I
 really
 loved
 Barney.


Okay.
 I
 really
 loved
 Barney.
 So,


this
 is
 your
 boy
 in
 our
 apartment
 when
 I


was
 three
 years
 old.


I
 was
 I
 was
 a
 Barney
 kid,
 bro.
 I
 like


Barney.


I
 like
 I
 freaking
 like
 Kill
 Me.
 I
 like


Barney.
 Okay,
 whatever.
 I
 like
 Barney.


Like,
 to
 go
 from
 that


to
 a
 full-on
 guy
 who
 could
 get
 targeted


from
 Pounder
 Software
 with
 my
 beard.
 I


mean,
 goodness
 gracious,
 bro.


This
 is
 wild.


This
 is
 a
 wild
 28
 years
 later.
 It's


crazy.


It's
 a
 whole
 different
 world.


A
 whole
 freaking
 different
 world.


I
 love
 you.
 You
 love
 me.
 We're
 a
 big


We're
 a
 big
 happy
 family,
 dude.
 I
 used


to
 be
 obsessed
 with
 Barney.
 I
 used
 to
 be


obsessed
 with
 uh
 Snow
 White.
 Snow
 White


is
 what
 I
 used
 to
 like
 my
 mom
 had
 she


she
 like
 would
 pre-record
 some
 of
 these


Disney
 movies.
 Snow
 White
 and
 the
 Dwarfs


I
 used
 to
 be
 obsessed
 with.
 Oh,
 Beauty


and
 the
 Beast.
 Oh
 my
 god,
 I
 was
 obsessed


with
 that
 movie
 when
 I
 was
 a
 little


girl.
 And
 then
 Barney.


Those
 were
 like
 the
 main
 I
 would
 like


watch
 those
 over
 and
 over.
 I
 would
 watch


those
 two
 movies
 over
 and
 over
 and
 over


and
 over
 and
 over
 again.


That's
 what
 That's
 what
 I
 was
 obsessed


with.
 That's
 I'm
 not
 gonna
 beat
 the


allegation
 saying
 this.
 I'm
 not
 gonna


beat
 it.
 But
 VHS,
 dude,
 there
 was
 no


DVR.
 That
 was
 VHS.
 That
 was
 like
 on
 the


actual
 VHS.


But
 to
 go
 from
 that
 to
 here
 today,
 it's


just
 crazy,
 bro.


It's
 just
 freaking
 crazy,
 bro.
 Life
 is


cra
 I
 was
 making
 a
 thread.
 I'm
 going
 to


post
 this
 on
 December
 31st,
 but
 I
 was


making
 this
 thread
 on
 Twitter
 of
 like


the
 craziest
 moments
 of
 2025,
 and
 I
 was


just
 like
 compiling


everything
 from
 uh


everything
 from
 this
 year.


And
 so
 far,
 I
 have
 the
 Bloomberg


appearance,


uh
 getting
 to
 uh
 interview
 Figure
 CEO,


uh
 getting
 to
 ask
 Vlad
 a
 question
 at
 the


Q1
 earnings
 in
 PaloAlto
 when
 I
 sat
 with


him.
 in
 like
 on
 the
 couch
 and
 I
 was


asking
 him
 that
 question
 or
 those
 like


seven
 minute
 interview.
 Uh
 then
 we
 have


I
 I I
 met
 Beiju
 who
 was
 a
 Robin
 Hooded


co-founder
 that
 same
 week.
 Then
 I


interviewed
 Mike
 Gallagher.
 Then
 we
 had


the
 Tom
 Lee
 interview.
 Then
 we
 asked
 the


question
 with
 the
 currently
 right
 now.


Then
 we
 had
 the
 New
 York
 City
 meetup,


the
 Toronto
 meetup,
 the
 Boston
 meetup,


the
 Miami
 meetup.
 Uh
 then
 we
 had
 the


Karp
 interview
 back
 in
 at
 September.


Like
 it's
 just
 been
 a
 wild
 wild
 crazy


freaking
 year.


But
 at
 the
 same
 time
 with
 how
 crazy
 the


year
 has
 been,
 we
 hit
 100k
 subs,
 right?


So
 that
 that's
 another
 moment.
 But
 with


how
 crazy
 the
 year
 has
 been,
 it's
 like


it's
 like
 you're
 getting
 older
 as
 the


years
 are
 progressing.
 So,
 you're
 like


reflecting
 on
 the
 years,
 but
 you're
 also


just
 like
 dealing
 with
 the
 reality
 of


getting
 older,


which
 I
 just
 think
 is
 something
 that


I
 don't
 know,
 now
 that
 it's
 approaching


30,
 like
 it's
 it's
 hitting
 me
 more
 like


deeply
 versus
 like
 when
 it
 was
 like
 24,


25,
 26,
 it
 didn't
 feel
 that
 real.


Also,
 I
 actually
 think
 I
 have
 some
 time


to
 reflect
 now.
 The
 past
 couple
 years


has
 been
 like
 just
 pure
 grind.
 Zero


reflect.
 Yes,
 grinder.
 Yes,
 you
 guys


make
 the
 jokes,
 but
 now
 it's
 like
 been
 a


little
 bit,
 you
 know,
 settled
 into
 your


own
 place.
 You
 have
 some
 little
 some


time
 to
 just
 sit
 back
 and
 actually


think
 about
 [ __ ]


28
 is
 not
 midlife
 crisis
 time.
 Dude,
 it


basically
 is.
 It
 basically
 is.
 Sam
 says,


"Try
 40s
 with
 kids."
 Okay,
 but
 I
 feel


like
 when
 you
 have
 the
 kids,


like
 you've
 already
 Look,
 dude,
 when
 you


have
 the
 you've
 already
 accomplished
 so


much
 in
 life
 when
 you
 have
 kids,
 you've


brought
 life
 into
 this
 world.
 Like
 at


that
 point
 you've
 already
 accepted,


okay,
 you
 are
 an
 older
 human
 being
 that


has
 brought
 life
 into
 this
 world.
 You


now
 you,
 you
 know,
 you
 you
 have
 an


obligation
 to
 care
 and
 nurture
 that


life.
 Like
 I
 feel
 like
 that's
 a
 little


bit
 different
 before
 you
 even
 get
 to


that
 stage
 and
 you're,


you
 know,
 getting
 older
 at
 at
 the
 same


time.


Yeah.
 When
 your
 brain
 is
 fully
 formed.


When
 does
 when
 does
 when
 does
 a
 human's


brain
 fully
 develop?


30
 25
 to
 30.
 Google
 says
 25
 to
 30.


Okay.
 So,
 I
 need
 uh
 I
 need
 a
 couple
 more


years.


Well,
 Google
 says
 25
 to
 30,
 so
 yeah,
 I


guess
 it's
 25
 for
 those
 that
 are
 saying


that,


but
 it's
 in
 that
 time
 frame.


Uh
 TJ,
 bro,
 we
 were
 just
 talking
 about


you
 and
 how
 Notto
 finally
 gave
 you
 some


love.


Finally
 gave
 you
 some
 love
 on
 X
 after


freaking
 talking
 about
 that
 man's
 stock


and
 buying
 his
 freaking
 shares
 for
 four


years


and
 selling
 calls
 against
 them.


Shout
 out
 to
 Mr.
 TJ.


Please
 don't
 cry.
 No,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


cry,
 bro.
 It's
 not
 a
 it's
 getting
 older


is
 not
 really
 a
 crying
 thing
 or
 anything


like
 that.
 It's
 just
 it's
 just
 more
 so


an
 acknowledgement
 internally
 of
 just


like
 oh
 [ __ ]
 Like
 it's
 like
 you
 know


you're
 getting
 older.


Also
 I
 want
 to
 get
 married.
 I
 want
 to


have
 kids.
 Right.
 So
 I'm
 like
 I'm
 also


thinking
 of
 like
 okay
 28
 like
 I
 don't


know
 32
 33
 is
 that
 when
 you
 kind
 of
 like


really
 try
 to
 settle
 down
 and
 then
 what


steps
 do
 you
 take
 before
 that?
 And
 like


I
 don't know
 it's
 like
 there's
 a
 lot


more
 things
 you
 think
 about
 now
 that
 you


weren't
 thinking
 about
 at
 21.
 At
 21,
 you


were
 just
 like,
 "How
 do
 I
 [ __ ]
 go


after
 it?
 How
 do
 I
 go
 after
 it?"
 And
 I


feel
 like
 at
 28,
 you're
 like,
 "Okay,
 I


still
 want
 to
 go
 after
 it,
 but
 I
 also


wanna


I
 also
 want
 to
 think
 about
 the
 other


parts
 of
 life."
 And
 I
 think that's


important,
 bro.
 You
 got
 to
 be
 holistic,


right?
 You
 got
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 of


different
 perspectives
 to
 to
 to
 to
 try


to
 culminate
 into
 like
 what
 is
 a


worthwhile
 life
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 different


areas.
 And
 that
 that
 means
 you
 have
 to


take
 on
 more
 responsibility,


which
 is
 not
 an
 easy
 thing
 to
 do.
 But,


you
 know,
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 important
 as


you
 grow
 older.


Ed
 says,
 "Get
 getting
 married
 is
 the


real
 long-term
 investment
 you
 need
 to
 do


a
 deep
 dive
 on."
 Yeah,
 that
 is
 fair.


I
 do
 want
 to
 get
 married.
 I
 know
 there's


a
 a
 movement
 in
 my
 generation
 of
 not


getting
 married
 and
 being
 single
 forever


and
 not
 having
 kids.
 Definitely
 do
 want


those
 two
 things.


I
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 how
 it's
 gonna
 how


it's
 going
 to
 turn
 out.


But
 it's
 one
 of
 those
 things,
 right?


Like
 as
 you
 get
 older,
 you
 start


thinking
 about
 also,
 do
 you
 have
 any


regrets
 in
 life?
 Are
 there,
 you
 know,


like
 you
 start
 thinking
 of
 that
 [ __ ]


because
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to


think
 of
 it
 as
 you
 get
 older
 because


like
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 think
 about
 this


stuff
 when
 you're
 at
 the
 end.
 So
 you
 do


want
 like
 you
 want
 to
 cautiously


think
 about
 it
 and
 like
 try
 to
 minimize,


as
 Jeff
 Bezos
 would
 say,
 the
 regrets,


right?
 Like
 if
 there's
 a
 friend
 that
 you


haven't
 talked
 to
 in
 a
 while
 and
 you're


like,
 "Well,
 I
 shouldn't
 have
 gotten


away
 from
 that
 friend.
 Let
 me
 hit
 them


up."
 like
 if
 they
 don't
 respond
 then


then
 at least
 you
 did
 your
 part,
 right?


To
 try
 to
 rekindle
 whatever
 friendship


or
 something.
 But
 but
 I
 do
 think
 it
 is


important


as
 you
 get
 older
 to
 kind
 of
 like
 gut


check
 that
 stuff.


Dude,
 I
 was
 I
 was
 speaking
 to
 one
 of
 my


one
 of
 my
 one
 of
 my
 friends
 who
 who
 got


married
 a
 couple
 months
 ago.
 So
 So
 he
 a


week
 before
 two
 weeks
 before
 he
 gets


married,
 if
 he
 if
 he's
 listening,
 he'll


he'll
 know
 who
 he
 is.
 Two
 weeks
 before


he
 gets
 married,
 he
 calls
 me
 up.
 He's


like,
 "Bro,
 I'm
 done
 with
 this
 [ __ ]


I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 getting
 married
 to
 it.


And
 I
 and
 I
 listen
 and
 I'm
 like,
 "All


right,
 bro.
 You
 gotta
 make
 your


decision,
 right?"
 A
 couple
 days
 later,


he's
 like,
 "No,
 we
 made
 up.
 We're
 good.


We're
 good.
 We're
 good
 to
 go."
 I'm
 like,


"All
 right,
 bet.
 Marriage
 is
 on."
 They


get
 married.
 Three
 days
 ago,
 they
 got


married
 a
 couple
 months
 ago.
 Three
 days


ago,
 he
 text
 me.
 He's
 like
 I
 think
 I
 I


think
 I
 told
 him
 I
 was
 like, "Yeah,
 you


got
 to
 come
 through
 with
 your
 girl,
 see


the
 new
 apartment,
 all
 this
 stuff."
 He's


like, "Yeah,
 about
 that."
 I
 was
 like,


"What
 do
 you
 mean
 about
 that?"
 He's


like,
 "It's
 good
 thing
 I
 had
 a
 prenup."


I'm
 like,
 "Bro,


a
 couple
 months,
 bro.
 A
 couple
 months."


He
 said, "Yeah,
 bro."
 He's
 like, "It's
 a


good
 thing
 I
 have
 a
 prenup."
 Like,
 damn.


At
 that
 point,
 you
 should
 have
 just


trusted
 your
 intuition
 a
 couple
 weeks


before
 the
 marriage
 and
 been
 like,
 "This


is
 not
 going
 to
 work."
 I
 still
 have
 to


call
 him
 about
 it,
 but
 he
 was
 texting
 me


the
 other
 day.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Damn,
 bro.


Damn.


That's
 wild,
 right?"
 cuz
 you
 were
 he
 was


so
 close
 to
 not
 getting
 married
 and
 he


does
 I
 was
 going to
 go
 to
 his
 marriage.


I
 just
 it
 got
 so
 busy
 in
 August
 and
 uh


it's
 a
 good
 thing
 I
 didn't
 waste
 my
 time


going
 to
 his
 marriage,
 bro.
 That
 [ __ ]


didn't
 work
 out.
 That
 [ __ ]
 didn't
 work.


I
 was like
 what?
 Like
 that
 would
 I
 mean


that
 just


that
 is
 wild,
 bro.


But
 she
 doesn't
 have
 any
 of
 his
 shares.


She's
 not
 entitled
 to
 any
 of
 his
 stock,


which
 is
 good.
 He
 Dude,
 he
 was
 you
 know


when
 you
 get
 married
 you
 combine
 your


finances.
 He
 was
 thinking
 of
 paying
 off


her
 student
 loans
 and
 he's
 like,
 "Dude,


thank
 goodness
 I'm
 coming
 to
 this


conclusion
 and
 I
 didn't
 even
 start


paying
 off
 any
 of
 her
 debt


cuz
 that
 would
 have
 sucked.


That
 would
 have
 sucked."


No,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 call
 him,
 bro.
 I


don't
 think
 he
 wants
 I
 don't
 think
 he


wants
 to
 talk
 about
 it
 publicly
 in
 front


of
 thousands
 of
 people,


but
 we're
 we're
 relatively
 close.
 I've


known
 him
 for
 about
 four.
 We
 met
 because


of
 pounder,
 you
 know,
 we
 we
 met
 just
 as


pounder
 investor.
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of


friends
 from
 2021
 2022
 that
 I
 met.


Another
 one
 of
 my
 friends
 who
 who
 like


ironically
 another
 one
 of
 my
 friends


just
 asked
 his
 girl
 to
 to
 marry
 him.
 He


texted
 me
 the
 engagement
 ring
 picture.


He's
 also
 I
 met
 him
 through
 Palanter.


So,
 it's
 kind
 of
 crazy,
 but


these
 are
 things
 I
 feel
 like
 you
 think


about
 as
 you
 as
 you
 get
 older
 as
 well.


Uh,
 Jatinder,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super


chat.
 Love
 your
 show.
 I
 highly
 recommend


you
 read
 The
 Road
 Less
 Traveled
 by
 M.


Scott
 Peek.
 I
 feel
 like
 I've
 heard
 about


this
 book.
 The
 Road
 Less
 Traveled.


I
 will
 Yeah,
 I
 will.
 I
 will
 definitely


put
 this
 on
 the
 list.


It's
 a
 It's
 a
 phrase
 linked
 to
 Robert


Frost's
 poem,
 right?
 The
 poem
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 people
 know.


It
 feels
 like
 it's
 it's
 a
 it's
 linked
 to


that.
 two
 roads
 diverged
 in
 a
 wood
 and
 I


took
 the
 one
 less
 traveled
 by
 and
 that


has
 made
 all
 the
 difference.
 I
 I


genuinely
 believe
 in
 this
 idea
 like
 this


right
 here.
 I
 genuinely
 believe
 in
 the


idea
 of
 taking
 the
 role
 the
 the
 the
 road


less
 traveled.
 I
 really
 do.
 I
 really
 do.


every
 every
 every
 every
 decision
 I
 made


in
 life
 where
 you
 take
 the
 road
 less


traveled
 aka
 the
 road
 that
 most
 people


don't
 want
 to
 take
 because
 it's
 hard


it's
 difficult
 it's
 unknown


and
 I
 I
 also
 think
 that
 is
 the
 beauty
 of


youth
 right
 because
 you
 just
 you
 just
 go


for
 it
 and
 you
 don't
 care
 like
 you
 think


you
 can
 take
 on
 the
 world
 and
 you
 really


aren't
 thinking
 about
 the
 implications


and
 the
 competitive
 dynamics
 and
 what
 it


means
 to
 set
 up
 a
 business
 and
 be


successful
 and
 you
 don't
 care
 about
 any


of
 that
 [ __ ]
 you're
 just
 like
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 go
 for
 it


and
 uh
 you
 know
 that's
 this
 whole


YouTube
 journey
 it's
 like
 I


I
 didn't
 know
 what
 I
 was
 doing.
 It
 was


just
 like,
 let's
 just
 do
 it.
 Let's


figure
 it
 out.
 Let's
 use
 whatever


intrinsic
 skills
 or
 talent
 I
 have
 to
 try


to
 build
 something
 and
 we'll
 we'll
 keep


going
 from
 there.
 And


then
 you
 just
 end
 up
 working
 and
 working


and
 working.
 And


I
 think
 the
 one
 thing
 that's
 really


important
 when
 you
 take
 the
 road
 less


traveled
 and
 this
 is
 what
 I
 you
 know
 I


was
 I
 was
 um
 I
 was
 I
 was
 talking
 to


someone
 the
 other
 day
 who
 who
 who's


trying
 to
 like
 build
 a
 social
 media


brand
 and
 and
 the
 most
 important
 thing


is
 if
 you
 see
 a
 hint
 of
 momentum
 you
 you


you
 you
 you
 try
 to
 capture
 it
 so
 deeply


and
 this
 is
 this
 is
 applicable
 to


anything
 in
 life
 and
 you
 don't
 let
 it
 go


because
 it's
 so
 hard
 to
 get
 momentum
 on


anything.
 Same
 same
 thing
 with
 a
 stock,


right?
 Like
 once
 your
 stock's
 narrative


changes
 and
 you
 can
 build
 on
 that


narrative
 and
 then
 you
 can
 keep
 putting


out
 more
 press
 releases
 and
 partnerships


and
 then
 you
 have a
 good
 quarter,
 you


get
 profitable,
 like
 then
 it's
 off
 to


the
 races.
 Then
 you
 have
 the
 liquidity


of
 the
 public
 markets
 which
 is
 a
 global


ecosystem
 of
 cash
 that
 needs
 to
 be


deployed
 somewhere
 and
 your
 narrative


could
 end
 up
 creating
 a
 lot
 of
 wealth.


And
 I
 think
 it's
 the
 same
 thing
 in
 the


journey
 of
 life.
 Like
 once
 you
 get
 a


little bit
 of
 momentum
 in
 whatever


you're
 doing,
 you
 just
 like
 you you
 you


take
 it
 so
 seriously.
 You
 don't
 take
 it


as
 a
 joke
 and
 you
 tell
 yourself,
 "I
 will


not
 let
 this
 go


and
 you
 just
 never
 know
 what
 it
 results


in."


But
 you
 also
 got
 to
 do
 it
 the
 right
 way.


You
 also
 got
 to
 do
 it
 in
 a
 way
 that's


not
 like
 uh
 not
 not
 not
 not
 uh


not
 not
 in
 a
 way
 that
 sells
 yourself


out,
 sells
 out
 your
 soul,
 which
 is
 the


hardest
 part
 to
 do.
 Like
 these
 freaking


NBA
 players
 and
 their
 gambling
 nonsense,


right?
 Like
 you
 got
 to
 you
 got
 to
 do
 it


in
 a
 way
 that's
 not
 going
 to


give
 up
 a
 lot
 of
 your
 core
 philosophies.


Dude,
 we
 got
 some
 after
 hours
 action.


S&P
 672,
 Hoodie
 almost
 136.
 Grab
 577.


Not
 bad.
 This
 sucker
 was
 at
 568
 today.


Nvidia's
 up.
 Bit
 farms
 is
 up.
 Cipher
 is


up.
 Wow.
 Bit
 farm's
 18%.


Is
 there
 is
 there
 something
 happening


after
 hours?
 Uh,


dude,
 everything's
 moving.
 Futures
 are


green.


Trump
 Trump's
 not
 speaking.


Nebus
 is
 up.
 SoFi
 is
 up.


Wow.
 Nebias


108.
 It
 was
 at
 105
 most
 of
 the
 day.


Iran's
 pumping.
 Yeah,
 we
 saw
 the
 Jane


Street
 sake
 in
 Cipher.
 I
 don't
 know if


that's
 enough
 to
 pump
 everything.
 It's


definitely
 helping
 Cipher.
 Iran
 back
 to


58.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 there's
 uh


any
 wild
 news,
 but
 you
 do
 have
 some


green.
 Quantum
 stocks
 are
 green.
 Yes,


they
 are
 green
 after
 hours.
 DWaves
 up.


Regetti
 NQ.
 You
 got
 pretty
 much


everything


that's
 catching
 catching
 a
 bit.


Oh,
 Jane
 Street
 took
 a
 stake
 in


Bitforms,
 too.


I
 mean,
 again,
 they
 kind
 of
 have
 to


because
 they're
 fulfilling
 all
 these


orders,
 but
 yes,
 the
 street
 will
 react


to
 that
 immediately.
 Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.


Bit
 farms.


Again,
 the
 Jane
 Street
 is
 not
 taking
 a


stake
 in
 Bit
 Farms
 because
 they
 love
 Bit


Farms.
 They
 have
 to
 own
 these
 shares.


But
 it's
 a
 great,
 you
 know,
 narrative


that
 people
 run
 with.
 Like
 this
 is
 not


Bridgewwater,


you
 know,
 this
 this
 is
 not
 a
 money


management
 firm
 that's
 making
 an


opinionated
 choice
 on
 how
 they
 think
 of


a
 stock.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 everything
 else


Jane
 Street
 owns,
 they
 own
 a
 lot
 of


companies.
 Same
 with
 Vanguard.
 Same
 with


Black
 Rockck.


Maybe
 maybe
 that's
 enough
 though
 to
 pump


the
 entire
 data
 center
 space.
 Just


people
 getting
 excited
 that


you're
 seeing
 this
 happen


and
 that
 CPI
 leaked.
 Yeah,
 maybe
 CPI


leaked.
 Maybe


Record
 $ 38
 billion
 debt
 sale
 near
 for


Oracle
 data
 centers.
 Oh,
 I
 think
 that


might
 be
 it.
 I
 think
 that
 might
 be
 it.


That's
 why
 all
 the
 that
 that's
 actually


why
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners
 are
 running.


That's
 actually
 why


uh


record
 38
 billion.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 Two


minutes
 ago.
 38
 billion
 debt
 sale
 near.


Wow.


Did
 they
 actually
 sell
 38
 billion
 worth


of
 corporate
 bonds?


Did
 they
 actually
 sell
 almost
 40
 billion


of
 corporate
 debt?


Who
 the
 hell
 bought
 all
 their
 debt?


Yeah,
 that's
 super
 bullish.
 Ian,
 Nebia,


Cipher,
 Cororee,
 because
 that
 signals


that
 if
 Oracle
 can
 get
 40
 billion
 of


debt
 financed
 for
 guess
 what
 data


centers,


then
 all
 these
 other
 smaller
 companies


that
 are
 not
 as
 big
 as
 Oracle
 are


probably
 going
 to
 catch
 a
 bid
 for
 data


centers.


Triple
 beat,


bro.
 40
 billion.


Holy
 guacamole,
 dude.


My
 goodness.


Where's
 Oracle
 right
 now?
 Oracle.


Okay,
 Oracle


little
 red
 on
 this
 because
 they're
 the


one
 selling
 the
 debt.
 And
 again,


Oracle's
 already
 had
 a
 massive
 move,
 but


overall
 these
 other
 companies,


it's
 wild.
 AI
 revolution,
 baby.


AI
 revolution.
 The
 Saudis.
 I
 mean,
 it's


probably
 a
 consortium
 of
 a
 lot
 of


they're
 giving
 like
 six
 and
 a
 half


percent
 on
 the
 on
 the
 CDs,
 which
 is


better
 than
 a
 money
 market.
 So,
 you


know,
 there's
 plenty
 of
 investors
 that'd


be
 willing
 to
 to
 take
 that
 bet
 with


Oracle.


It's
 very
 possible.


Um,


VB,
 thanks
 for
 the
 $10
 super
 chat.
 Happy


birthday.
 Appreciate
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for


the
 super
 chat.
 John
 says,
 "Make
 sure
 to


schedule
 vacations
 and
 time
 with
 my
 fam


and
 friends.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 $5
 super


chat."
 Yeah,
 my
 cousin's
 going
 to
 be


coming
 over
 for
 Thanksgiving,
 so
 we'll


spend
 some
 time
 with
 her.
 Uh,
 my
 mom


wanted
 to
 do
 Europe,
 but
 November's
 I


mean,
 we
 were
 thinking
 of
 UK
 in
 the
 in


November,
 but
 it's
 just
 getting
 way
 too


tight
 in
 November
 to
 to
 actually
 plan


that.
 So,


look,
 next
 year
 when
 I
 go
 for
 the


meetups,
 I
 want
 to
 like
 bring
 some
 of
 my


family
 and
 like
 make
 it
 an
 excuse
 to
 do


a
 little
 vacation
 with
 them.
 So,
 you


know,
 the
 the
 goal
 is
 the
 UK,
 Germany,


and
 Singapore
 for
 the
 internationals,


hopefully
 a
 few
 others.
 And
 then,
 you


know,
 in
 the
 US,
 we're
 going
 to
 try
 to


do
 LA.
 Still
 haven't
 done
 Los
 Angeles


yet.
 Definitely
 going
 to
 do
 New
 York.


Try
 to
 do
 Chicago.
 Some
 of
 the
 states


that
 we
 didn't
 do
 last
 year,


but
 it
 should
 be
 fun.
 Yo,
 Dubai.


Dubai.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 gonna
 happen.
 I'll


just
 tell
 you
 guys
 right
 now,


but
 I
 got
 I
 got
 hit
 up
 from
 a
 conference


that's
 happening
 in
 Dubai.


And
 again,
 I
 really
 don't
 know
 if
 it's


happening
 yet.
 Very
 preliminary


discussion,
 but
 they're
 like, "Do
 you


want
 to
 speak
 at
 the
 conference?"
 I
 was


like,
 "That'd
 be
 pretty
 cool."
 They
 want


to
 speak
 on
 like
 the
 rise
 of
 retail


investing
 and
 what
 it
 means
 to
 build
 a


community
 and
 like,
 you
 know,


crowdsource
 due
 diligence,
 all
 this


stuff.
 like
 a
 really
 big
 conference
 in


the
 UAE.


I
 was
 like,
 "That'd
 be
 pretty
 cool."


They're
 like, "We
 can
 pay
 for
 it."
 I
 was


like, "That'd
 be
 even
 cooler.
 That'd
 be


even
 cooler."
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's


going
 to
 happen,
 though.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


it's
 going
 to
 happen
 because
 it's
 it's


it's
 not
 directly
 the
 conference.
 It's


someone
 who
 works
 very
 closely
 with
 the


conference
 who,
 ironically,
 bro,
 this


guy
 subscribed
 to
 my
 Substack.
 Okay?


There's
 there's,
 by
 the
 way,
 there's
 no


payw
 wall
 on
 my
 Substack,
 but
 some
 of


you
 guys
 are
 freaking
 crazy
 and
 you


actually
 signed
 up
 for
 a
 paid


subscription.
 And
 I
 guess
 because
 people


just
 want
 to
 show
 the
 support,
 but
 he


signed
 up
 for
 a
 paid
 subscription.
 I


recognize
 the
 name.
 I
 go
 on
 Twitter.
 I'm


like,
 "Holy
 [ __ ]
 I
 know
 this
 guy.
 He's


a
 CEO
 of
 a
 big
 ass
 company."
 Then
 I
 go


to
 the
 the
 company
 website.
 I've
 been


following
 this
 company
 for
 the
 past
 10


years.
 years.
 I
 can't
 say
 what
 company


it
 is,
 but
 it's
 a
 really
 important


company
 in
 a
 very
 specific
 niche.
 And


I've
 been
 following
 their
 Instagram


account
 for
 like
 the
 past
 10
 years.
 And


so
 I
 hit
 him
 up
 on
 Twitter
 and
 I'm
 like,


"Bro,
 thanks
 for
 subscribing
 to
 the


Substack.
 Appreciate
 the
 support."
 And


uh
 yeah,
 I've
 been
 following
 your
 your


journey
 for
 the
 past
 10
 years.
 And
 he


was
 like, "Bro,
 I'm
 thinking
 of


investing
 in
 Dolingo."
 So,
 I
 had
 to


freaking
 I
 had
 to
 read
 this
 deep
 dive.


And
 then
 he
 was
 like, "By
 the
 way,
 you


want
 to
 speak
 at
 this
 conference
 that


I'm
 at?"
 And
 I'm
 like,
 "Sure,
 be
 pretty


cool.
 That'd
 be
 fun."


So,
 I
 don't
 know if
 it's
 going
 to
 happen


because
 he
 hasn't
 got
 back
 to
 me
 yet,


but
 um


I
 might
 as
 well
 just
 say
 the
 name
 of
 the


conference,
 bro.
 There's
 like
 it's
 not


even
 official
 yet.
 So,
 if
 it
 happens,
 it


happens.
 What
 is
 it
 called?
 Uh
 it's


called
 the
 1
 billion
 follower
 summit
 in


Dubai.
 1
 billion
 follower
 summit
 in


Dubai.


Again,
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 if
 I'm
 doing
 it.


If
 I
 if
 I
 would,
 as
 you
 guys
 can
 see


right
 there,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 January


9th,
 10th,
 and
 11th.


I
 just,
 dude,
 I
 want
 to
 be
 I
 want
 to
 see


like


like
 it's
 like
 I
 want
 to
 see
 Middle


Eastern
 culture.
 Like
 I've
 never
 I've


only
 seen
 videos
 of
 Dubai
 and
 like
 I've


never
 actually
 experienced
 like
 I
 want


to
 go
 I
 want
 to
 uh
 get
 on
 the
 top
 of
 the


Burj
 Khalifa
 and
 [ __ ]
 I've
 never
 done


it
 yet.
 I
 want
 to
 wear
 this
 outfit
 too,


bro.
 I
 want
 to
 wear
 this
 outfit.
 I
 want


to
 walk
 around
 in
 that
 outfit.


Will
 they
 kill
 me
 if
 I'm
 not
 religious


and
 I
 wear
 this
 outfit?
 Or
 can
 Am
 I


allowed
 to
 just
 wear
 the
 outfit?
 Am
 I


It's
 like
 I'm
 still
 allowed
 to
 like
 wear


the
 outfit,
 right?
 What
 is
 it
 called?


You
 guys
 know
 the
 outfit
 I'm
 talking


about?
 The
 the
 the
 thing
 the
 uh


what
 is
 it
 called,
 bro?
 I
 don't
 know


what
 it's
 called,
 but
 I
 wanna
 I
 wanna


freaking
 I
 want
 to
 wear
 that
 one
 day.


But
 but
 yeah,
 this
 is
 the
 conference.


Look,
 15,000
 content
 creators.


Uh
 freaking


freaking
 uh


uh
 30,000
 attendees,
 420
 speakers.


Yeah,
 this
 What
 is
 this
 guy
 wearing,


bro?
 What
 is
 this
 thing
 called?
 I
 want


to
 wear
 this,
 bro.
 I
 really
 want
 to
 wear


this.


Condura.


Condura.


Yes.
 Condura.
 Yes.
 This
 is
 it.
 I
 want
 to


do
 the
 bro.
 I
 feel
 like,
 dude,
 how
 cool


does
 this
 [ __ ]
 look,
 bro?


I
 feel
 like
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be


disrespectful
 about
 it,
 bro.
 Like,
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 want
 them
 to
 like


say
 anything
 if
 I
 wear
 this,
 but
 like,


am
 I
 even
 allowed
 to
 wear
 this?
 But


like,
 I
 want
 to
 wear
 this,
 bro.
 This
 is


so
 cool.


But
 like,
 yeah,
 this
 this
 is
 the
 this
 is


the
 summit.
 This
 is
 the
 summit.
 So,
 I


don't know
 if
 I'll
 be
 there,
 but
 if
 I


do,
 it'll
 be
 pretty
 cool.


And
 so,
 yeah,
 maybe
 we
 see
 Dubai.


[Laughter]


wear
 a
 jersey
 over.
 Okay,
 that
 comment


wins
 today.
 That
 comment
 from
 Feed
 the


Liberty
 Tree.
 That
 comment
 wins
 today.


That
 comment
 freaking
 wins
 today.
 I
 wore


one
 riding
 a
 camel
 in
 Dubai.
 See,
 I
 want


to
 do
 that.
 I
 want
 to
 do
 that.


Feel
 like
 that
 would
 be
 hilarious.


That'd
 be
 pretty
 cool.
 Oracle.
 All


right.
 123.25
 $.25
 billion
 package
 will


go
 towards
 funding
 a
 data
 center
 in


Texas
 and
 another
 14.7
 billion
 in


Wisconsin.


Wow,
 guys.
 This
 is
 legit.
 We
 got
 a
 legit


Oracle
 corporate
 debt
 sale
 of
 freaking


$40
 billion.


My
 goodness,
 dude.


Um,


yeah,
 Larry
 Ellison
 is
 on
 a
 roll.


38
 billion.
 Okay.
 So,
 Wisconsin
 and


Texas,


that
 is
 what
 we're
 looking
 at
 for
 this


debt
 sale.


All
 right.
 There
 you
 go.
 There
 you
 go.


But
 yeah,
 maybe
 we'll
 see
 Dubai.
 If
 not,


we're
 definitely
 going
 to
 come
 to
 Dubai


eventually.
 It
 would
 be
 pretty
 cool
 if


we
 can
 go
 and,
 you
 know,
 it
 would
 we


could
 do
 I
 don't
 know if
 we
 could
 do
 a


meet
 up
 there,
 but
 it
 would
 be
 cool
 to


just
 see
 people
 that
 are
 in
 the
 region,


but


it
 would
 be
 fun
 to
 uh
 to
 go
 visit.


Mid,
 please
 release
 us.
 Us
 Europeans


need
 to
 go
 to
 sleep.
 How
 long
 have
 we


been
 just
 yapping?


I
 feel
 like
 every
 Thursday
 we
 end
 up


doing


Well,
 we
 used
 to,
 then
 we
 started
 macro


Thursdays
 and
 we
 ended
 up
 yapping
 about


the
 macro,


but
 when
 Chris
 doesn't
 make
 it,
 we
 end


up
 just
 yapping.
 Yeah,
 Bloomberg
 just


reported
 it.
 38
 billion.
 Vantage
 Data


Centers
 is
 developing
 both
 data
 centers


which
 are
 used
 by
 Oracle
 and
 OpenAI.


Wells
 Fargo,
 Goldman,


Sumitumo,
 Mit
 Mitsui
 Banking
 Corp.
 BNP


parab


by
 the
 France
 thing
 and
 then
 society


general


have
 all
 allocated
 portions
 of
 the


financing
 package
 after
 a
 first
 round
 of


selecting
 underwriters.
 Damn,
 bro.
 They


got
 the
 Europeans,
 the
 Americans,
 the


Japanese,
 and
 the
 Saudis
 in
 this
 $40


billion
 deal.


Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.


This
 AI
 [ __ ]
 is
 real.


This
 AI
 [ __ ]
 is
 real.
 No,
 Johny
 Phillips


in
 the
 deal.


I
 definitely
 clobbered
 those
 names,
 bro.


I
 definitely
 said
 those
 names
 wrong.


Parab


Paraby.


Dude,
 I
 can't
 call
 Steve.
 Steve's
 busy.


I
 just
 told
 you
 he
 was
 in
 meetings.


I'll
 be
 live
 with
 Okay,
 I
 should
 leave


now
 because
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 live
 with


him
 anyway
 at
 9:30.
 So,
 we'll
 talk
 on
 uh


Steve's
 channel
 later,
 too.


Yeah.
 So,
 does
 this
 mean
 that
 other


people
 are
 buying
 off
 Oracle's
 debt


today
 and
 they'll
 be
 repaid
 with


interest?
 Correct.
 So,
 people
 are
 giving


Oracle
 money
 right
 now.
 Oracle's


probably
 I
 mean,
 the
 last
 corporate
 debt


sale
 they
 did
 was
 13.5
 billion
 at
 6.5%.


If
 it's
 anything
 similar
 to
 that,
 Oracle


will
 repay
 them
 that
 money
 with


interest.
 But
 Oracle
 is
 like,
 "Dude,


let's
 take
 on
 the
 debt
 because
 we're


going
 to
 make
 some
 money
 off
 this
 money.


We're
 going
 to
 make
 way
 more
 than
 six


and
 a
 half
 percent.
 Our
 stock's
 going
 to


go
 way
 higher
 than
 six
 and
 a
 half


percent.
 So,
 we
 can
 pay
 the
 six
 and a


half
 percent."
 And
 the
 debt
 issuers
 are


happy
 with
 it
 because
 you
 know
 they're


getting
 six
 and a
 half%.


40
 billion
 is
 incredible.


Singapore
 thing
 in
 July
 26.
 July
 26.


Yeah.
 Sometimes
 debt
 is
 good
 debt.


Sometimes
 debt
 is
 good
 debt.


It
 just
 depends.
 That's
 why
 when
 Dave


Ramsey
 is
 like,
 "Oh,
 if
 if
 someone
 gave


me
 a
 billion
 dollars
 of
 0%,
 I
 wouldn't


take
 it."
 I'm
 like,


This
 guy
 is
 the
 is
 the
 big
 financial


media


like
 empire
 like
 like
 like
 if
 someone


gives
 you
 a
 billion
 dollars
 at
 0%.


I
 feel
 like
 some
 I
 feel
 like
 someone
 can


figure
 out
 how
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 more


than
 0%
 on
 a
 billion
 and
 eventually


because
 you
 know
 if
 you're
 getting
 it
 at


zero
 as
 long
 as
 you
 don't
 absolutely


gamble
 it
 away
 you
 should
 be
 able
 to
 get


more
 than
 0%.


You
 could
 literally
 put
 it
 in
 a
 money


market
 fund,


get
 two
 and
 a
 half%
 in
 a
 couple
 years
 of


rates
 come
 down
 and
 then
 pay
 back
 the


billion.
 Like
 when
 I
 hear
 this
 [ __ ]
 from


him,
 it's
 like,
 how
 is
 this
 real
 advice?


How
 is
 this
 like
 legit?


Some
 debt
 is
 okay.


Yeah,
 you
 just
 can't
 do
 the
 spy
 zero


DTE,
 but
 some
 dead
 is
 okay.


All right,
 cool.
 I
 got
 to
 get
 out
 of


here.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.
 Appreciate


it.
 Uh,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 pre-birth


wishes.
 We'll
 have
 a
 fun
 session
 on


Monday
 next
 week.
 Uh,
 I'll
 get
 some


pictures
 of
 the
 past
 life
 and
 um,


yeah,
 I'll
 show
 you
 guys
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 parts
 of


the
 past
 28
 years
 of
 being
 alive.
 Um,


daily
 recap
 will
 be
 out
 in
 a
 couple


hours.
 I'll
 be
 live
 with
 Steve
 at
 9:30.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 it.


Oracle
 40
 billion.
 There
 you
 go.


There
 you
 go.
 Data
 center
 plays
 going


wild
 out.
 Oh,
 now
 Oracle's
 green.
 There


you
 go.
 Now
 Oracle
 goes
 green.
 S&P
 672.


I
 mean,
 this
 could
 set
 up
 for
 a
 decent


Friday.
 Never
 know
 because
 Fridays
 are


Fridays,
 but
 this
 possibly
 could
 set
 up


for
 a
 decent
 Friday.


I
 will
 tell
 Michelle
 and
 Ray
 to
 go
 to


the
 Chicago
 meetup.
 Yes,
 dude.
 I
 think


the
 meetups
 are
 going to
 be
 I
 think
 2026


we
 can
 take
 you
 to
 the
 next
 level


because
 I
 really
 feel
 good
 about
 the
 the


people
 I'm
 working
 with
 and
 um
 they
 they


they
 they
 understand
 the
 dynamics
 of


what
 I'm
 trying
 to
 do.
 I
 was
 very
 clear


with
 them
 of
 how
 I
 want
 to
 do
 this
 and
 I


just
 need
 more
 support
 to
 make
 it


happen.
 So
 I
 think
 next
 year
 should
 be


fun.
 We
 should
 all
 be
 able
 to
 meet
 in


person.
 All
 right,
 that's
 it.
 Thank


everybody.
 Appreciate
 it.
 See
 you
 on
 the


daily
 recap
 and
 then
 if
 not
 on
 Steve


stream
 I
 will
 see
 you
 guys
 tomorrow
 on


the
 market
 open.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Love
 you
 all.
 See
 you
 guys
 tomorrow.
 Bye


everybody.
 Have
 a
 good
 one.
