it
 is
 such
 a
 privilege
 to
 have
 the
 four


of
 you
 with
 us
 today
 Greg
 Howard
 what
 a


way
 to
 start
 this
 conference
 today
 that


was
 incredible
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 we
 are


now
 joined
 by
 Jin
 and
 Patrick
 and
 we'll


aim
 to
 take
 the
 discussion
 further
 so
 if


I
 interrupt
 any
 of
 you
 please
 bear
 with


me
 this
 is
 just
 to
 make
 the
 most
 of
 the


time
 that
 you
 have
 kindly
 given
 us
 Jin


I'll
 start
 with
 you
 so
 Greg
 and
 Howard


uh
 runner
 through
 their
 investment


philosophy
 and
 the
 need
 for
 an


investment
 Creed
 you
 run
 Wellington
 uh


which
 can
 be
 seen
 as
 a
 Federation
 of


investment
 boutiques
 what
 are
 really
 the


advantages
 and
 the
 pitfalls
 of
 not


having
 to
 have
 an
 overarching
 investment


philosophy
 thank
 you
 and
 um
 thank
 you


for
 sharing
 all
 your
 insights
 that
 was


really
 fascinating
 um
 when
 I
 was
 sitting


there
 listening
 it
 made
 me
 think
 you


know
 we
 have
 about
 60
 teams
 like
 you


said
 we're
 or
 we're
 not
 organized
 by
 one


overarching
 philosophy
 and
 process
 I


guess
 our
 overwatching
 philosophy
 and


process
 is
 that
 we
 believe
 a
 philosophy


and
 process
 is
 critical
 um
 to
 the


investment
 team
 we
 have
 about
 60
 teams


um
 and
 um
 and
 and
 each
 of
 those
 teams
 we


have
 we
 have
 a
 few
 in
 the
 audience
 today


each
 of
 those
 teams
 have
 a
 very
 strong


philosophy
 and
 process
 very
 similar
 to


what
 um
 Greg
 and
 Howard
 um
 do
 and
 that's


what
 they
 practice
 every
 day
 and
 that's


what
 they
 believe
 um
 we
 combine
 that
 at


Wellington
 um
 every
 I
 think
 every


company
 has
 an
 edge
 I
 think
 our
 Edge
 is


um
 that
 we
 are
 really
 collaborative
 so


we
 have
 over
 the
 you
 know
 I've
 been
 at


Wellington
 for
 33
 years
 over
 those
 33


years
 we
 have
 really
 broken
 down
 silos


and
 so
 that
 our
 long
 only
 investors
 on


in
 equity
 collaborate
 with
 our
 fixed


income
 um
 um
 colleagues
 who
 collaborate


with
 our
 private
 call
 colleagues
 who
 do


private
 assets
 and
 who
 do
 long
 short
 um


that's
 the
 secret
 sauce
 like
 how
 do
 we


we
 don't
 have
 one
 CIO
 we
 have
 600
 cios


and
 we
 have
 normalized
 debates
 having


different
 perspectives
 on
 any
 topic
 and


then
 and
 then
 each
 of
 those
 teams
 can
 go


and
 practice
 their
 very
 well
 thought
 out


strong
 strongly
 held
 beliefs
 about
 how


they're
 going
 to
 make
 money
 for
 clients


that
 that's
 how
 we're
 organized
 very


good
 Patrick
 I'll
 pull
 you
 into
 the


conversation
 that
 the
 private
 nature
 of


what
 you
 do
 have
 any
 direct
 implications


on
 your
 investment
 process
 is
 there


anything
 intrinsically
 different
 between


private
 Market
 investing
 and
 public


market
 investing
 well
 um
 I
 suppose
 given


my
 deme
 of
 nature
 I
 might
 sound
 like
 the


poster
 child
 for
 private
 Equity
 but
 I'll


say
 um
 look
 I
 think
 private
 Equity
 is
 an


advantaged
 asset
 class
 if
 you're
 going


to
 be
 in
 the
 investment
 business
 um
 and


you
 sort
 of
 start
 with
 just
 the


structure
 you
 know
 we
 have
 a
 10
 we
 have


a
 a
 5-year
 investment
 period
 we
 can
 have


the
 money
 invested
 for
 10
 maybe
 12
 years


so
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 invested
 all
 the


time
 you
 can
 pick
 your
 spots
 that's
 a


huge
 Advantage
 you
 get
 to
 do
 inside


diligence
 that's
 an
 absolutely
 huge


Advantage
 you
 get
 to
 choose
 and
 select


your
 management
 teams
 you
 get
 to
 borrow


money
 and
 I've
 been
 doing
 this
 for
 30


years
 and
 I
 can
 remember
 I
 really
 over


you
 know
 my
 first
 15
 years
 you
 actually


borrowed
 money
 with
 covenants
 but
 for


the
 last
 15
 years
 we
 get
 lent
 money


without
 covenants
 so
 that's
 sort
 of


extraordinary
 you
 get
 to
 choose
 when
 you


want
 to
 sell
 a
 business
 um
 and
 you
 get


to
 have
 alignment
 you
 know
 in
 the


boardroom
 it's
 sort
 of
 the
 investor
 and


the
 management
 team
 you
 get
 to
 choose


three
 to
 four
 things
 that
 you
 really


want
 to
 go
 for
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 huge


Advantage
 so
 as
 we
 think
 about
 sort
 of


our
 own
 investment
 process
 and
 sort
 of


managing
 risk
 like
 Howard
 and
 Greg
 you


know
 talked
 about
 you
 know
 it's
 really


about
 being
 super
 micro
 obsessed
 with


the
 specifics
 of
 the
 business
 and


ensuring
 that
 we
 you
 know
 maintain
 our


standards
 that
 way
 MH
 and
 you
 really


invest
 for
 the
 longterm
 and
 that
 could


be
 like
 a
 good
 say
 segue
 into
 long-term


investing
 um
 Greg
 Howard
 how
 do
 you


incorporate
 how
 does
 investment
 Horizon


fit
 into
 your
 investment
 philosophy
 and


your
 invest
 or
 like
 philosophic
 breed


well
 like
 uh
 Patrick
 says
 um
 maybe
 half


of
 our
 assets
 are
 closed
 in
 funds
 where


you
 have
 the
 money
 for
 a
 period
 of
 time


and
 the
 great
 Advantage
 is
 that
 the


clients
 can't
 withdraw
 so
 you
 know


they
 people
 out
 of
 control
 of
 their


situation
 love
 to
 buy
 when
 they're


excited
 and
 sell
 when
 they're
 depressed


and
 our
 our
 this
 approach
 keeps
 them


from
 doing
 so
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 greatest


Advantage
 one
 can
 have
 in
 the
 investment


business
 um
 I
 think
 that
 everybody
 at


Oak
 Tree
 understands
 our
 culture
 we


don't
 we
 actually
 don't
 even
 have
 a


tenant
 of
 our
 philosophy
 to
 talks
 about


long-term
 investing
 it's
 just
 understood


you
 know
 when
 I
 when
 I
 travel
 especially


to
 Europe
 and
 people
 find
 out
 I'm
 in
 the


investment
 business
 they
 say
 oh
 what
 do


you
 trade
 my
 back
 goes
 up
 I
 said
 we


don't
 trade
 trading
 is
 guessing
 what


something's
 going
 to
 do
 tomorrow
 we're


investors
 we're
 in
 it
 for
 the
 long
 term


and
 I
 think
 that
 um
 I
 think
 everybody
 on


this
 stage
 is
 more
 of
 an
 investor
 than
 a


Trader
 uh
 it
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


understand
 how
 one
 gets
 an
 advantage
 in


the
 short
 term
 running
 such
 a
 systematic


strategy
 correct
 do
 you


agree
 well
 I
 think
 the
 mean
 things
 when


I
 listen
 to
 Howard
 and
 and
 what


everybody
 on
 the
 stage
 saying
 I
 think


the
 main
 thing
 is
 is
 in
 the
 long
 term


you
 have
 to
 know
 what
 your
 advantage
 is


and
 that's
 the
 big
 thing
 right
 so
 for
 us


our
 our
 time
 frame
 that
 we
 really


understand
 well
 we
 focus
 on
 is
 6
 to
 18


months
 so
 for
 some
 that's
 very
 long
 term


for
 some
 that's
 very
 short
 term
 but
 but


6
 to
 18
 months
 is
 what
 we've
 thought


really
 hard
 about
 is
 and
 um
 and
 believe


despite
 Howard's
 thoughts
 on
 macro


investing
 that
 that
 we
 have
 an
 edge
 in


understanding
 what's
 happened
 in
 the


world
 now
 we
 are
 wrong
 a
 lot
 to
 his


point
 and
 so
 you
 have
 to
 know
 how
 to
 be


prepared
 for
 being
 wrong
 and
 within


macro
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 macro
 things


going
 on
 so
 you
 can
 diversify
 across


Ross
 many
 different
 things
 that
 you're


you're
 talking
 about
 but
 um
 but
 I
 think


the
 starting
 point
 is
 that
 and
 that


there
 the
 longterm
 is
 going
 to
 work
 out


if
 you
 know
 what
 your
 Edge
 is
 if
 you


stick
 to
 it
 if
 you're
 humble
 about
 it


and
 you
 continue
 to
 learn
 and
 long
 term


is
 not
 going
 to
 work
 out
 if
 you're
 stuck


on
 any
 particular
 um
 thing
 that
 you


might
 be
 wrong
 about
 and
 that
 you
 don't


have
 a
 way
 of
 constantly
 improving
 and


constantly
 learning
 um
 but
 for
 each
 of


us
 I
 think
 the
 main
 question
 is
 what
 is


the
 edge
 do
 you
 actually
 have
 it
 and
 can


you
 continue
 to
 improve
 it
 mhm
 you
 are


known
 as
 a
 very
 long-term
 investor
 in


your
 portfolio
 manager
 days
 which
 still


um
 one
 how
 do
 you
 encourage
 your


portfolio
 managers
 at
 Wellington
 to


think
 long
 term
 so
 part
 of
 it
 is
 our


structure
 because
 we
 are
 a
 private


partnership
 we
 are
 we
 we
 can
 incent


investors
 we
 can
 evaluate
 them
 we


develop
 them
 over
 long
 periods
 of
 time


so
 that
 that
 structure
 enables
 that
 that


we
 are
 we
 are
 really
 paying
 our


investors
 over
 very
 aligned
 with
 our


clients
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 one
 of
 the


very
 key
 advantages
 um
 and
 then
 because


we
 have
 60
 investors
 like
 I'm
 one
 of
 the


longest
 term
 I'm
 probably
 very
 similar


to
 Howard
 I
 don't
 quite
 have
 a
 12year


horizon
 but
 I
 have
 a
 really
 low
 turnover


my
 turnover
 is
 10
 to
 12%
 it
 very
 much


aligns
 with
 the
 industry
 that
 I
 invest


in
 which
 is
 a
 very
 long
 cycle
 low


turnover
 low
 turnover
 industry
 and


Healthcare
 um
 but
 but
 there
 are
 others


that
 have
 higher
 turnover
 and
 so
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 we
 try
 to
 do
 is
 we
 we
 do


a
 lot
 of
 trading
 analytics
 are
 you


making
 money
 off
 your
 trading
 if
 you're


not
 if
 you
 have
 a
 shorter
 term
 time


Horizon
 um
 back
 to
 what
 Greg
 said
 what's


your
 sweet
 spot
 of
 of
 them
 H
 having


insights
 and
 and
 being
 able
 to
 so
 there


are
 some
 people
 who
 are
 fantastic
 who


have
 high
 turnover
 and
 then
 and
 then
 I


strongly
 believe
 for
 me
 as
 a
 as
 an


investor
 having
 a
 a
 low
 turnover


strategy
 is
 and
 really
 taking
 advantage


of
 the
 insights
 I
 have
 over
 the
 long


term
 is
 what
 has
 enabled
 me
 to
 do
 well


over
 many
 years
 but
 really
 having
 that


self-awareness
 of
 how
 you
 generate


insights
 how
 you're
 going
 to
 make
 money


for
 your
 clients
 with
 whatever
 asset


class
 you
 have
 I
 think
 is
 key
 to
 that


excellent
 Howard
 you
 touched
 on
 on


market
 efficiency
 and
 the
 importance
 of


that
 there's
 now
 endless
 information
 and


a
 lot
 of
 noise
 in
 the
 market
 um
 but


markets
 arguably
 become
 more
 efficient


over
 time
 so
 a
 question
 to
 both
 of
 you


how
 do
 you
 compare
 the
 alpha
 generation


opportunity
 of
 your
 investment


strategies
 now
 compared
 to
 say
 10
 20


years
 ago
 I
 think
 it's
 gotten
 a
 lot


harder
 over
 time
 Pedro
 you
 know
 Warren


Buffett
 talks
 about
 having
 bought


dollars
 for
 50
 cents
 60
 uh
 years
 ago
 you


could
 do
 that
 uh
 50
 40
 years
 ago
 I


myself
 bought
 things
 that
 I
 said
 this


this
 can't
 be
 exist
 and
 yet
 you
 you
 got


Bargains
 virtually
 that
 couldn't
 miss


it's
 very
 hard
 today
 uh
 if
 you
 think


about
 it
 everybody
 knows
 everything


today
 there's
 no
 such
 thing
 today
 as
 not


knowing
 something
 something
 if
 it's
 if


it's
 fact
 uh
 today
 it's
 rather
 easy
 for


portfolio
 managers
 to
 screen
 for


Securities
 that
 satisfy
 certain
 criteria


you
 know
 you
 used
 to
 be
 able
 to
 buy


companies
 for
 less
 than
 their
 the
 cash


in
 the
 till
 uh
 we
 called
 that
 net
 net


investing
 you
 can't
 do
 that
 anymore
 and


so
 over
 time
 uh
 knowledge
 is
 cumulative


markets
 become
 more
 efficient
 uh
 it
 has


become
 harder
 uh
 to
 beat


markets
 still
 I
 believe
 believe
 some


people
 can
 be
 superior
 their
 margin
 of


superiority
 May
 shrink
 their
 their
 work


day
 may
 get
 longer
 uh
 but
 I
 I
 still
 it's


possible
 but
 it
 becomes
 harder
 every


day
 yeah
 I
 think
 again
 it
 depends
 on
 the


nature
 like
 even
 when
 you
 describe
 it
 50


years
 ago
 people
 could
 but
 not
 most


people
 didn't
 right
 like
 even
 like
 at


some
 point
 having
 a
 calculator
 was
 an


advantage
 and
 obviously
 having
 a


calculator
 is
 no
 longer
 an
 advantage
 but


I
 I
 look
 at
 it
 a
 little
 differently
 I


think
 it's
 like
 the
 nd500
 or
 whatever


the
 cars
 get
 better
 every
 year
 so
 you


have
 to
 get
 better
 every
 year
 but
 they's


still
 a
 winner
 mhm
 um
 and
 so
 if
 you
 stay


if
 you
 don't
 get
 better
 then
 you
 for


sure
 any
 advantage
 will
 will
 seep
 into


General
 understanding
 but
 if
 you


continue
 to
 get
 better
 it
 is
 like
 the


n500
 and
 the
 core
 at
 least
 the
 core


things
 that
 I
 believe
 our
 Alpha
 is


generated
 from
 really
 aren't
 changing


much
 I
 don't
 think
 we're
 getting
 any


better
 as
 a
 species
 on
 things
 like
 love


and
 fear
 and
 and
 greed
 like
 we
 keep


doing
 the
 same
 things
 more
 or
 less
 over


and
 over
 again
 so
 I
 agree
 on
 things
 like


calculating
 and


Arbitrage
 that
 is
 like
 much
 easier
 to
 do


it's
 generally
 well
 known
 those
 things


are
 not
 there
 anymore
 but
 the
 fact
 that


people
 are
 going
 to
 make
 we
 all
 will


make
 really
 dumb
 mistakes
 and
 if
 you


have
 ways
 of
 understanding
 that
 and


doing
 that
 that
 that
 continues
 and
 I


really
 when
 I
 look
 at
 the
 markets
 and


the
 volatility
 of
 the
 prices
 relative
 to


the
 fundamental
 conditions
 or
 whatever


it
 doesn't
 look
 like
 we're
 getting
 that


much
 smarter
 um
 it's
 true
 on
 arbitrages


are
 going
 away
 I
 think
 that
 is
 the
 case


things
 that
 you
 can
 calculate
 are
 going


away
 things
 that
 are
 very
 hard
 to


calculate
 seem
 as
 volatile
 as
 ever
 um


and
 the
 miscalculations
 of
 human
 beings


continue
 um
 so
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 again


I
 would
 agree
 if
 it's
 an
 established


Arbitrage
 it
 will
 not
 exist
 for
 like


it'll
 get
 learned
 but
 other
 things
 um


continue
 more
 or
 less
 as
 they
 have


through
 all
 human
 history
 it
 appears
 to


me
 are
 there
 still
 more
 inefficiencies


in
 a
 in
 private
 markets
 to
 be
 explored


relative
 to
 public
 and
 for
 how
 long
 I


think
 the
 PRI
 I
 mean
 private
 markets


were
 what
 40
 years
 now
 into
 ins


institutionalization
 of
 private
 markets


and
 you
 know
 for
 sure
 private
 Equity
 um


I
 think
 that
 there
 uh
 you
 know
 is
 a


whole
 class
 of
 uh
 investing
 that
 goes
 on


of
 my
 world
 where
 we
 buy
 from
 each


other's
 portfolios
 cuz
 like
 uh
 you
 know


why
 do
 you
 rob
 a
 bank
 because
 that's


where
 the
 money
 is
 so
 many
 assets
 are


owned
 in
 private
 hands
 so
 I
 look
 at


Christian
 we
 bought
 a
 business
 from
 you


Nick
 humph
 is
 here
 from
 HG
 we
 bought


misses
 from
 them
 and
 what's
 really


interesting
 is
 the
 return
 profile
 of


buying
 things
 in
 the
 private
 markets


even
 from
 professional
 owners
 like


sponsors
 is
 really
 the
 same
 as
 it
 would


be
 for
 a
 primary
 buyout
 and
 so
 you
 sort


of
 sit
 there
 you
 say
 you
 ask
 yourself


why
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


factors
 including
 you
 know
 having
 a


differentiated
 point
 of
 view
 which


Howard
 spoke
 about
 it's
 having


professionally
 trained
 management
 teams


that
 really
 you
 know
 know
 what
 they're


doing
 in
 terms
 of
 businesses
 so
 I


actually
 think
 right
 now
 uh
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 inefficiencies
 in
 in
 the
 public


markets
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 ton
 of
 really


good
 businesses
 but
 crummy
 stocks
 you


know
 25%
 of
 the
 public
 markets
 are
 50%


or
 below
 their
 highs
 so
 you
 know
 in


terms
 of
 my
 shopping
 list
 um
 I'm


spending
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 time
 at
 the


public
 markets
 right
 now
 because
 I
 think


you
 get
 much
 more
 volatility
 in
 the


Public
 Public
 markets
 than
 you
 do
 in
 the


private
 markets
 because
 when
 you're


private
 and
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 sell


you
 don't


sell
 changing
 tack
 a
 bit
 Greg
 talked


about
 the
 power
 of
 compounding
 learning


um
 things
 may
 not
 always
 pan
 out
 the
 way


that
 we
 thought
 that
 we
 think
 that
 they


will
 um
 how
 do
 you
 instit


institutionalize
 learning
 from
 mistakes


in
 your


organization
 so
 um
 we
 do
 we
 do
 a
 number


of
 things
 some
 shortterm
 we
 have
 a
 daily


meeting
 every
 day
 and
 in
 that
 daily


meeting
 which
 happens
 in
 our
 London


office
 between
 Asia
 and
 London
 and
 and


in
 between
 Boston
 and
 our
 us
 offices
 in


in
 London
 every
 day
 we
 talk
 about
 um
 all


kinds
 of
 things
 and
 including
 sometimes


we
 talk
 about
 if
 something's
 happening


in
 the
 market
 you
 know
 what
 did
 you


learn
 from
 the
 last
 time
 the
 market
 was


like
 that
 what
 what
 mistakes
 did
 you


learn
 so
 we
 do
 that
 that's
 sort
 of
 a


constant
 a
 constant
 and
 back
 to
 like


having
 different
 perspectives
 there
 will


be
 people
 that
 will
 come
 to
 our
 daily


meeting
 and
 said
 I
 got
 this
 wrong
 and


this
 is
 what
 I
 learned
 so
 we
 have


normalized
 um
 sort
 of
 not
 being
 a
 star


and
 not
 being
 right
 all
 the
 time
 which


is
 as
 we
 know
 being
 an
 investor
 you're


wrong
 quite
 often
 um
 so
 that
 so
 those


are
 some
 of
 the
 things
 we
 do
 and
 then
 we


also
 do
 these
 things
 called
 Lessons


Learned
 so
 we
 would
 have
 someone
 who's


been
 investing
 for
 25
 years
 or
 30
 years


and
 um
 and
 we
 asked
 them
 to
 be


vulnerable
 like
 what
 like
 what
 was
 what


really
 was
 the
 reason
 and
 the
 seminal


moments
 in
 your
 investing
 career
 and


it's
 really
 about
 investing
 these
 these


talks
 who
 they
 are
 as
 a
 person
 what
 do


they
 believe
 and
 how
 are
 they're


investing
 what
 are
 the
 four
 or
 five


guide
 posts
 that
 sort
 of
 made
 their


career
 and
 those
 are
 all
 recorded
 and


people
 watch
 them
 and
 and
 learn
 from


them
 um
 and
 it
 gives
 you
 a
 good


appreciation
 of
 of
 just
 that
 people


people
 are
 human
 beings
 um
 we
 try
 to
 you


know
 we
 don't
 have
 a
 star
 culture
 and


the
 more
 people
 are
 willing
 to
 teach


others
 um
 and
 teach
 themselves
 that
 and


you
 know
 as
 we
 know
 you
 you
 you
 haven't


learned
 everything
 like
 I'm
 in
 my


mid-50s
 I've
 been
 investing
 for
 33
 years


I'm
 still
 learning
 um
 and
 so
 how
 do
 you


how
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 that's
 part
 of


the
 everyday
 language
 so
 those
 are
 some


of
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 the
 things
 we
 do


constantly
 over
 time
 that
 sort
 of


normalizes
 the
 fact
 that
 you're
 making


mistakes
 all
 the
 time
 good
 Howard
 any


views
 on
 the
 institutionalization
 of
 M


mistakes
 um
 you
 know
 we
 we
 don't
 have
 a


process
 for
 that
 uh
 your
 question


suggests
 to
 me
 maybe
 that
 we
 should
 uh


and
 maybe
 and
 maybe
 that's
 why
 I'm


curious
 and
 maybe
 we
 will
 uh
 but
 uh
 our


uh
 we
 have
 groups
 as
 as
 Jean
 says
 uh
 and


and
 a
 high
 degree
 of
 uh
 Independence
 uh


we're
 decentralized
 in
 our
 decision


making
 process
 as
 long
 as
 in
 our
 case


everybody
 follows
 the
 same
 philosophy


and
 goal
 system
 uh
 but
 uh
 but
 we
 don't


have
 a
 process
 for
 uh
 post-mortems
 and
 I


think
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 good
 way
 to
 learn
 MH


it's
 so
 so
 critical
 to
 our
 philosophy


and
 we
 to
 be
 clear
 it's
 very
 hard


because
 the
 thing
 that
 she's
 talking


about
 was
 so
 important
 which
 is
 you
 you


the
 last
 thing
 you
 want
 to
 do
 is
 punish


mistakes
 you
 have
 to
 help
 people
 learn


and
 and
 so
 we
 struggled
 with
 the
 right


institutionalization
 but
 I've
 been


institutionalizing
 this
 for
 a
 long
 time


so
 just
 to
 share
 quickly
 thoughts
 on
 it


I
 mean
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 would
 say
 if
 I


were
 in
 anybody's
 organization
 that


doesn't
 like
 having
 a
 real
 issue
 log
 is


so
 valuable
 and
 it
 actually
 works
 like


for
 us
 it's
 very
 easy
 for
 people
 to


enter
 issues
 and
 again
 when
 you
 think


through
 what
 are
 the
 issues
 that
 matter


everybody's
 got
 issues
 but
 the
 issues


that
 matter
 to
 us
 are
 the
 things
 that


are
 preventing
 you
 from
 achieving
 your


goals
 and
 so
 to
 me
 then
 having
 a


diagnosis
 process
 that
 we
 let
 people


make
 it
 easy
 for
 people
 to
 enter
 and


make
 it
 easy
 for
 people
 like
 to
 diagnose


what's
 happening
 there's
 two
 levels
 of


that
 there's
 the
 level
 of
 like
 in
 the


org
 problems
 but
 then
 you
 have
 this


record
 you
 actually
 diagnose
 and
 decide


are
 you
 going
 to
 change
 anything
 as
 a


result
 of
 this
 right
 it's
 easy
 to
 talk


about
 problems
 but
 are
 you
 actually


changing
 anything
 and
 often
 times
 the


right
 answer
 is
 I'm
 not
 changing


anything
 um
 like
 that
 mistakes
 are
 a


normal
 part
 of
 it
 but
 knowing
 whether


actively
 deciding
 are
 we
 going
 to
 change


something
 or
 are
 we
 not
 going
 to
 change


something
 super
 important
 so
 having
 a


simple
 way
 for
 people
 to
 do
 that
 and
 see


that
 it's
 actually
 happening
 is
 super


important
 encouraging
 it
 mostly
 most


important
 is
 that
 the
 most
 senior


leaders
 the
 CEO
 the
 CIO
 they're
 the
 ones


getting
 issue
 logged
 and
 they're
 the


ones
 staring
 because
 they
 make
 the


biggest
 most
 important
 decisions
 so


making
 sure
 the
 arrow
 of
 accountability


goes
 up
 not
 down
 um
 super
 critical


lesson
 in
 R
 I
 think
 we
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 the


arrow
 going
 down
 and
 it
 was
 a
 big


mistake
 encouraging
 the
 arrow
 of


accountability
 to
 go
 up
 uh
 was
 a
 huge


lesson
 in
 our
 organization
 i'
 change


everything
 honestly
 believe
 and
 the
 um


and
 then
 on
 the
 investment
 process
 I
 one


of
 the
 great
 things
 back
 to
 systematic


investing
 is
 you
 we
 know
 on
 attribution


every
 mistake
 down
 to
 every
 data
 every


little
 piece
 of
 logic
 every
 data
 we
 know


exactly
 why
 we
 got
 everything
 wrong
 like


speaking
 to
 his
 to
 his
 point
 about


terrible
 macro
 investing
 right
 like
 I


really
 thought
 we
 were
 going
 into
 a


recession
 two
 and
 two
 years
 ago
 or
 so


and
 man
 was
 I
 wrong
 right
 and
 and
 but


okay
 we
 learned
 something
 about
 the


world
 that
 we
 didn't
 know
 and
 um
 and
 by


being
 able
 to
 attribute
 that
 to
 every


line
 of
 reasoning
 everything
 that
 we
 had


ever
 learned
 that
 led
 us
 to
 that
 pretty


strong
 conclusion
 not
 so
 strong
 that
 was


disastrous
 in
 the
 way
 he's
 saying
 but


pretty
 strong
 strong
 conclusion
 knowing


that
 we
 could
 easily
 be
 wrong
 but
 that


that
 but
 being
 able
 to
 attribute
 that
 to


everything
 else
 and
 then
 attribute
 well


where
 did
 the
 money
 come
 from
 that


prevented
 that
 recession
 attribute
 every


one
 of
 those
 things
 and
 what
 do
 you


learn
 from
 that
 super
 super
 critical


thing
 to
 get
 to
 get
 right
 and
 I
 would


just
 say
 the
 thing
 I
 think
 everybody
 can


do
 and
 I
 would
 highly
 recommend
 just


have
 an
 issue
 log
 diagnose
 important


issues
 get
 in
 the
 habit
 of
 it
 and


normaliz
 it
 don't
 make
 the
 organization


so
 much
 better
 excellent
 one
 last
 topic


before
 we
 wrap
 up


specialization
 um
 so
 when
 investing
 what


are
 the
 tradeoffs
 uh
 between


specializing
 too
 much
 and
 missing
 the


big
 picture
 well
 I
 used
 to
 have
 a


yellowed
 clipping
 above
 my
 desk
 50
 years


ago
 orange
 so
 it
 came
 from
 the
 ft
 and
 it


said
 that
 an
 analyst
 is
 somebody
 who


knows
 a
 lot
 about
 a
 few
 things
 and


learns
 more
 and
 more
 about
 less
 and
 less


until
 he
 knows
 everything
 about
 nothing


a
 portfolio
 manager
 is
 somebody
 who


knows
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 a
 lot
 of
 things


and
 learns
 less
 and
 less
 about
 more
 and


more
 until
 he
 knows
 nothing
 about


everything
 we
 have
 to
 bridge
 that
 Gap
 we


have
 to
 know
 that
 there's
 information
 in


our
 organization
 that
 some
 people
 have


and
 other
 people
 need
 and
 we
 have
 to
 get


it
 to
 them
 and
 the
 people
 who
 need
 it


have
 to
 know
 that
 it
 exists
 and
 where


this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 greatest
 uh


challenges
 in
 our
 in
 any
 organiz


ganization
 Greg
 described
 uh
 the
 way
 all


of
 their
 learnings
 and
 findings
 are


actually
 uh
 computerize
 and
 computerized


and
 shared
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 good
 idea


but
 um
 you
 know
 how
 will
 the
 portfolio


manager
 who
 has
 to
 put
 together
 a
 large


number
 of
 assets
 about
 which
 he
 knows


less
 ever
 get
 full
 advantage
 of
 of
 the


knowledge
 that
 the
 analysts
 who
 know
 so


much
 about


a
 few
 things
 have
 and
 it's
 you
 know
 we


struggle
 with
 it
 all
 the
 time
 there's
 no


easy


answer
 very
 good
 we
 could
 go
 on
 forever


but
 we
 must
 finish
 now
 we
 will
 take
 a


break
 now
 Refreshments
 will
 be
 served
 uh


at
 the
 back
 in
 the
 Canen
 uh
 for
 those
 of


you
 watching
 live
 somewhere
 there
 uh
 we


will
 back
 in
 the
 room
 at
 11:
 at
 1:45


p.m.
 sorry
 um
 but
 before
 closing
 let
 me


thank
 you
 all
 for
 spending
 the
 time
 with


us
 uh
 in
 Oso
 today
 it
 was
 an
 immense


pleasure
 to
 have
 the
 four
 of
 you
 in
 this


panel
 please
 join
 me
 for
 a
 round
 of


applause
