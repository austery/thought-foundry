I am going to turn myself
into an optical illusion
by going through this window right here.
Ah, (grumbles) huh.
Okay, I'm good, oh, not good.
I was gonna say I'm good, I'm not good.
Okay, so you're looking at this window
and it looks like it's turning around,
except here it stops.
Now I keep rotating, but the
window is rotating through me.
What is happening?

They help you create the illusion
that you could be anywhere in the world.
Let me backup for a second.
This is the first part
of a three part illusion.
What do you see?
Well, there's a window
and it's turning, except it
stops and reverses direction.
So the window is
oscillating back and forth.
That's what most people see
when they look at this illusion
except that's not what the
window's actually doing.
It's on this turntable and
it is rotating continuously.
This is known as the Ames window illusion.
And I saw it on an old
Australian TV program
called the Curiosity Show.
And I was curious.
So in this video, I'm gonna
dig deeper into this illusion
than anyone has before.
You know the window
itself is not a rectangle,
but a trapezoid.
You can see this side here is much shorter
than this side over here.
And that is essential to the illusion.
Also essential, it is
shaded to make it look 3-D,
but it's actually just
a two dimensional card
with the same image on both sides.
So now that you know exactly
what this object looks like
and what it's doing, can
you correctly perceive
the rotation rather than the oscillation?
I still can't.
It still looks to my brain
like this window is going back and forth.
Okay, here's an idea.
I'm going to attach this Rubik's Cube
to the short side of the trapezoid
so we can keep track of
it as it goes around.
Are you ready?
Okay.
(dramatic music)
Okay, the Rubik's Cube is going around.
Everything seems normal.
But now what is that?
It looks like the Rubik's Cube
is continuing to go around,
but the window is
oscillating back and forth.
There it goes, the Rubik's
Cube around the back.
I don't even know what's happening.
(dramatic music)
Whoa, look at that.
It looks like the Rubik's
Cube is out drifting by itself
out in front of the whole illusion.
What is happening?
Okay new plan, I'm going to
take off the Rubik's Cube
and I'm gonna put a ruler
right through the middle of the window.
And so we can't possibly be
fooled by the illusion, right?
Okay, here we go.
Okay, the ruler is rotating around,
but wait now the window is
going backwards whoa, whoa!
The ruler is going through the window.
It is doing things which I
know are physically impossible
but that is how my brain is seeing it.
Look, here we go again.
The ruler is turning
around with the window
but right about here the
windows starts going backwards
but the ruler keeps coming.
What is even like, how is this possible?
This doesn't make any sense.
But that is the way my
brain interprets this.
It clearly prefers the illusion
over seeing what's really happening,
the continuous rotation.
So why is this, how
does the illusion work?
Well, it was created by
Adelbert Ames back in 1947.
And before becoming a researcher,
he wanted to be a visual artist.
So he was fascinated
by how people perceive shapes and shading.
And according to him,
the key to this illusion
is that we're all used to living
in rectangular boxes, essentially.
You know houses and rooms
where virtually all of the corners we see
are 90 degree angles.
Doors, windows, tables and chairs
are full of 90 degree angles.
This is called the
carpentered environment.
But unless we're looking
straight on at something,
the angles we actually
see are not 90 degrees.
I mean, the images that
form on our retinas
are typically trapezoids of
different shapes and sizes.
Now from extensive experience,
our brains know they
really should be rectangles
and right angles.
So our brains use these strange shapes
to infer depth information,
which in our rectilinear world
is almost always correct.
But not in the case of
a trapezoidal window
that our brains assume to be rectangular,
hence the illusion.
Now, if this carpentered
world hypothesis is correct,
well then you'd expect
people with less experience
of rectangles in their environments
to be less susceptible to the illusion.
And to test exactly this, in
1957 Harvard psychologists
tried the Ames window
illusion in South Africa
with 80 children, aged 10 to 14.
40 of them were living
in the city of Durban
full of rectangular
buildings, doors and windows.
The other 40 were from
nearby rural communities
where they lived in round huts
with few prominent 90 degree angles.
When subjects were seated 10 feet away
from the rotating Ames
window with both eyes open,
60% of the urban group
reported seeing the window oscillating.
But in the rural group, only
17.5% saw the same thing.
So the results were consistent
with the carpentered world hypothesis.
The kids with less
experience of rectangles
were less likely to fall for the illusion.
But that's not the whole story.
When seated 20 feet away
and with one eye closed,
the illusion was much more convincing.
Now, 90% of all participants
saw the window oscillating
and there was no significant difference
between urban and rural groups.
That means something else must
be going on over and above
our experience with rectangles.
In fact, you can get a similar illusion
without any straight lines at all.
This is the de Heer circle,
when rotating continuously,
it also appears to
oscillate back and forth.
So what's going on?
Well, both of these illusions
make use of a technique
called anamorphosis
which has been used by artists
for centuries if not millennia.
This is a painting from 1533
called The Ambassadors by
Hans Holbein the Younger.
It clearly shows two prominent figures,
but there's also this
distorted shape over the floor.
Only when viewed from the correct position
either of the top right or bottom left,
does it become clear that
the image is actually
a detailed depiction of a human skull.
It's suspected that the painting
was meant to be hung in a stairwell
where presumably out of
the corner of your eye,
you would spot the
striking image of the skull
reminding you of your own mortality.
But if you were to look
at the painting head-on
well, the skull would
be pretty hard to see.
Anamorphosis involves making
a distorted projection
of an object.
So to see its proper proportions,
you need to look at the work
from a particular position
or with a particular
device, often a mirror.
There are earlier examples
like Leonardo's Eye by Leonardo da Vinci,
which only takes its proper
form when viewed from the side.
Clearly, Leonardo knew
how to give side-eye.
And some might argue
that the cave paintings
at Lascaux France from 17,000 years ago
provide the first examples
of anamorphic art.
Due to the uneven painting surface,
artists would have had to consider
how their animal figures
would be perceived
from different vantage points.
(dramatic music)
Anamorphosis is also central
to perhaps Ames most famous
illusion, The Ames Room.
Ames designed his first
distortive room in 1934.
And with one eye, from
one privilege perspective
it just looks like an ordinary room.
But when people move around the room,
it becomes obvious that
something is not quite right.
An Ames Room is constructed
by taking an ordinary rectangular room
and adding a diagonal wall
through the middle of it.
Then draw lines connecting
all the key parts of the room
like corners, windows, and so on
to the privileged viewpoint.
Mark where those lines
intersect the diagonal wall.
Then add a floor and a ceiling.
If the projection is done properly,
they will not only be
tilted but also warped.
Then connect the floor and ceiling
with trapezoidal walls and
voila, you have an Ames Room.
(gentle music)
Ames realized there are an infinite number
of different distorted room geometries
which when viewed from
the privileged position
create virtually identical
images of a normal room.
So our perceptions far from transparently
representing external reality
are constantly faced with ambiguity.
And our brains below the
level of consciousness
have to decide which of
the infinite possibilities
we're actually looking at.
One form of ambiguity
relates to depth perception.
Which of these masks protrudes
outwards towards the camera,
and which is an impression?
Only through motion does it
become obvious, which is which.
We are subconsciously
attuned to visual cues
that indicate how close
or far away something is.
Closer objects are typically
bigger and brighter,
plus they obscure objects behind them.
But we can play with these attributes
in order to create situations
that defy our expectations.
Now I have been obsessed
with getting the Ames
window illusion to work.
Look at how many different Ames
windows I have been making.
And I made them small
initially, and then bigger.
There used to be a
disco ball in this room,
I never thought that
this would come in handy.
Then I thought about the question,
how could I make myself like the ruler
that passes through the Ames window?
And of course, then I would
need a very large Ames window.
So it's been this holiday season,
like we're living in a weird,
surreal art museum or something.
It needed to be at least eight feet
on its longest dimension.
It's actually made out
of six pieces of plywood,
glued, screwed together.
(saw cutting)
One of the challenges is
to make it really thin
because ideally it should
just be two dimensional.
So we had to bevel these edges here.
(gentle music)
So then I would twist
up these metal cables
that hang it to the ceiling
and then jump in the
window and let them unwind.
Ah,(grumbles) huh, okay.
So I'll show you some of the
best shots I was able to get
and you let me know,
does this work for you?
Do you see it oscillating
or do you just see it
rotating as it actually is?
I found lighting is really important.
The lighting needs to be
really even on both sides
to convince you that it
is really oscillating.
When the large side of the
trapezoid is close to us,
we perceive it rotating exactly as it is.
But when the large side
moves around to the back,
it is still larger in our field
of view than the small side.
So our brain perceives it as closer
and rotating in the opposite direction.
This is why the window
appears to oscillate.
Half the time we're seeing
the window as it is,
and half the time we're
seeing the bigger side
as closer to us, even
though it's farther away.
But how do we develop the ability
to interpret depth cues
in the first place?
Well, it seems to be an innate ability
which forms very early in our development.
They've actually shown babies
in three different age groups
five and a half months,
seven and a half months
and nine months the Ames window illusion.
Do they see the window oscillating?
And how would we know if they did?
Well, babies have a well-known
preference for novelty.
They look longer at things
that are new to them.
So experimenters first exposed them
to an ordinary rotating circle.
And then they showed them simultaneously
the Ames window and a
rotating rectangular window.
The five and a half month old babies
showed no special preference
for the Ames window.
But the seven and a
half and nine month olds
were significantly more
interested in the Ames window.
Suggesting they perceive it
as doing something different,
presumably oscillating.
The reason I have been so
obsessed with this illusion
is because I think it confronts
one of the big
misconceptions about science.
Which is this idea that scientists propose
competing theories, and
then all you have to do
is look at the data to decide
which is the best theory.
The truth is there are many circumstances
in which the same data
could come from very
different external realities.
To use a classic example,
does the sun go around the earth
or does the earth rotate on its axis?
The observation of the
sun moving across the sky
doesn't in itself resolve that debate.
Or to use more modern examples,
when you make a quantum measurement
does the wave function collapse
or does it branch the universe?
Is the speed of light really
the same in all directions
or does it differ and only
the roundtrip speed is seen?
As of right now the
data do not discriminate
between those theories.
And I think we can extend
this beyond science.
I mean maybe the Ames illusions
are a good metaphor for life.
We feel as though we can directly
perceive external reality
like a person looking into an Ames Room,
but the truth is there
are an infinite number
of different geometries that
would all look the same.
You know these days, a lot of people
are getting the same
fundamental information
but coming to very different conclusions
about the state of reality.
So I think in that context,
it's important to remember
that something as simple
as a little rotating picture
can fool our brains in
fairly spectacular ways.
So we should approach the world
and our conclusions about it
with a little more humility
and a little less certainty.

Now earlier this year,
I wanted to watch my favorite
sports team in the playoffs.
So I bought an all access
pass from the league.
But then when I went to watch a game,
there was a blackout
restriction in my area.
So I used NordVPN to set
my location to Australia
and watch the game from there.
In the past, I've made documentaries
that were free to stream
in the U.S. or Australia
but basically impossible to
access almost anywhere else.
And VPNs offer the solution.
They help you create the illusion
that you were somewhere else.
And with NordVPN, you get
access to 5,000 servers
in nearly 60 countries.
Plus using a VPN prevents
your internet service provider
from seeing the sites you visit.
And this is something I
take particular advantage of
when joining public Wi-Fis at
cafes or when I'm traveling.
In a time when everyone wants to capture
as much of your data as possible,
I think it's important to push back
and minimize the amount of
info you're putting out there.
And best of all, in this
special holiday deal
NordVPN is offering
68% off a two-year plan
