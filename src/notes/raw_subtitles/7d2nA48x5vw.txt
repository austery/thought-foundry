All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 close.


We
 are
 live.
 Uh
 we
 got
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 things
 going
 on
 in
 regards
 to


the
 equity
 markets.
 A
 lot
 of
 different


headlines.
 We
 got
 to
 talk
 about
 some
 of


these
 headlines
 that
 just
 came
 in.
 Also,


we've
 got
 some
 earnings
 after
 the
 belt.


Some
 of
 them
 in
 the
 semiconductor
 space,


which
 is
 going to
 be
 really
 important
 as


well.
 Uh
 so,
 we're
 going
 to
 take
 a
 look


at
 that
 and
 keep
 going
 from
 there.
 I


mean,
 so
 far,
 folks,
 based
 on
 what
 we're


seeing,


looks
 like
 we're
 going
 to
 end
 out
 on
 a


green
 day.
 Looks
 like
 we're
 going
 to
 end


out
 on
 a
 Wow,
 I
 didn't
 even
 see
 S&P
 for


the
 past
 30
 minutes.
 Not
 only
 did
 I
 not


see
 it
 hit
 684.
 It's
 at
 68490.


It
 almost
 touched
 685.
 Wow,
 what
 a
 day.


I
 did
 not
 see
 that,
 but
 there
 you
 go.
 I


did
 see
 Google
 get
 to
 270.
 Right
 now,


it's
 just
 or
 get
 close
 to
 270.
 It's
 at


26974,
 just
 below
 that
 at
 26902.
 So,


Google
 having
 a
 great
 day.
 Tessy
 got
 to


460
 at
 one
 point
 before
 a
 little bit
 of


a
 sell-off
 right
 there.
 Tesla
 right
 now


at
 440
 pound
 here.
 Hopefully
 we
 get
 that


190
 close
 even
 if
 we
 don't
 above
 189
 is


very
 nice.
 That's
 up
 2.8%
 on
 the
 day.


Robin
 Hood
 great
 day
 got
 to
 149
 almost


back
 to
 150
 147.
 Grab
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


breakout
 up
 4%.
 You
 got
 610
 on
 Grab.
 AMD


up
 2.2%.
 Qualcomm
 which
 was
 up
 more
 at


one
 point
 gave
 back
 50%
 of
 the
 gains.
 It


was
 up
 20%.
 Now
 it's
 up
 10%
 based
 on


them
 unveiling
 a
 new
 chip
 that


potentially
 could
 be
 a
 threat
 to
 AMD
 and


Nvidia.
 It's
 almost
 like
 the
 market
 woke


up
 after
 the
 announcement
 and
 said,


"Hey,
 maybe
 it's
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a


threat."
 Uh,
 so
 that
 one
 gave
 back
 some


of
 the
 gains,
 but
 still
 pretty
 good
 day


across
 the
 board.
 Apples
 up
 4%,
 Circle's


up
 half
 a
 percent,
 Pinterest
 is
 up,
 NHS


is
 up,
 Microsoft,
 PaloAlto
 Networks,


Ethereum
 4,200,
 just
 went
 slightly
 red


on
 the
 day,
 but
 still
 touched
 42.
 You


got
 Bit
 Mine
 right
 there
 5430.
 Bit
 mine


finally
 breaking
 above
 that
 50
 level.
 It


was
 at
 47
 last
 week.
 So,
 nice
 to
 see
 it


into
 the
 mid-50s
 and
 hopefully
 we
 can


get
 a
 close
 uh
 into
 that
 55
 56
 range


over
 the
 coming
 days.
 SMCI
 up
 from
 the


10%
 decline
 that
 it
 had
 last
 week.


Bitcoin
 right
 there
 just
 below
 115.
 I


mean,
 overall,
 it's
 been
 a
 pretty
 decent


day
 across
 the
 entire
 board
 and
 you're


not
 seeing
 that
 much
 weakness


across
 some
 of
 these
 different
 sectors.


Where
 is
 HIMS?
 Hims,
 okay,
 HIMS
 is


showing
 some
 weakness.
 That
 one's
 down.


Again,
 there's
 a
 short
 list
 of
 stocks


that
 actually
 are
 red
 today.
 A
 lot
 of


the
 other
 stocks
 are
 green.
 Rocket
 Lab


is
 green.
 That's
 up
 1.3%.
 ASST.
 This
 was


the
 new
 name
 that
 Mike
 Alfred
 took
 a


position
 in.
 That's
 up
 54%
 on
 the
 day.


So,
 if
 you
 got
 in
 it,
 I
 mean,
 you're


probably
 up
 if
 you
 didn't
 buy
 anywhere


near
 the
 180s
 right
 now
 at
 169.
 It
 was


kind
 of
 hovering
 around
 130,
 140
 for
 the


majority
 of
 the
 day.
 So,
 a
 bit
 of
 a


breakout
 right
 there.
 And
 that
 one


continues
 to
 go
 green.
 The
 one
 sector


that
 is
 getting
 hit
 today
 is


unfortunately
 these
 rare
 earth
 stocks.


TMQ
 down
 15,
 MP
 down
 seven,
 US
 down


eight,
 critical
 metals
 down
 15.
 Uh
 a
 lot


of
 this
 due
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 if
 tensions


with
 China
 are
 not
 going
 to
 be
 as
 bad
 as


we
 thought,
 the
 domestic
 demand
 for


suppliers
 in
 the
 United
 States
 is
 not


going
 to
 be
 as
 large.
 And
 even
 if
 it
 is


going
 to
 be
 super
 important
 for
 the


broader
 industry
 of
 supply
 chains,


particularly
 around
 semiconductors
 and


electronics,
 it
 might
 not
 be
 as
 massive


as
 what
 the
 market
 had
 expected.
 And
 so


that
 narrative
 has
 shifted
 a
 bit
 and


that's
 why
 you
 have
 a
 bit
 of
 decline
 on


those
 names.
 Everything
 else
 pretty
 much


green
 on
 the
 day.
 So
 you're
 seeing
 some


momentum.
 Yeah,
 even
 Dutch
 Bros.
 Even


Dutch
 Bros
 picking
 up
 on
 the
 green.
 Now,


let's
 get
 into
 the
 first
 story.
 We've


got
 11
 minutes
 until
 the
 market
 closes


today.
 Dutch
 Bros
 right
 there
 at
 5.7%.


The
 key
 earnings
 that
 I
 think
 most
 of
 us


are
 going
 to
 be
 looking
 at
 are
 uh


Cadence,
 Cadence
 Design
 Systems,
 that's


a
 very
 important
 one.
 Celestica,
 they


have
 earnings.
 Uh
 Confluent,
 if
 I'm
 not


wrong,
 do
 they
 have
 earnings?
 Yes,


Confluent,
 that's
 a
 software
 name,
 they


have
 earnings.
 They're
 down
 21%
 for
 the


year.
 Uh
 Cadence,
 another
 big
 company,


CDNS.
 And
 then
 Amcor,
 uh
 they
 also
 have


earnings
 today.
 So
 that's
 one
 that
 a


decent
 chunk
 of
 us
 are
 interested
 in.


Talked
 about
 that
 over
 the
 past
 couple


weeks.
 up
 from
 2850
 to
 33.
 So,
 we're


going
 to
 see
 what
 their
 earnings
 turn


out
 to
 today.
 Cadence
 right
 there
 up
 18%


on
 the
 day.
 Yes.
 And
 then
 NXPI.
 NXPI
 as


well.
 That
 one
 is
 uh
 also
 a
 big
 one
 that


we
 should
 look
 at.
 Thank
 you
 everybody


for
 the
 happy
 birthday
 wishes.


Appreciate
 it
 a
 ton.
 I'll
 get
 to
 the


super
 chats
 again
 near
 the
 end
 of
 the


show.
 We're
 going
 to
 stick
 around
 if
 you


are
 interested
 and
 we'll
 have a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 giveaway
 and
 some
 fun
 uh
 after


the
 market
 close.
 Steve
 will
 be
 on


around
 4:30.
 So,
 we'll
 get
 some
 people


on.
 We'll
 do
 some
 fun
 stuff
 and
 uh
 yeah,


we'll
 celebrate
 the
 day.
 SoFi
 tomorrow,


that's
 also
 important.
 We'll
 talk
 with


Steve
 about
 some
 of
 his
 thoughts
 on
 SoFi


going
 into
 tomorrow.
 Now,
 the
 big


headline
 uh
 as
 we
 get
 into
 the
 close
 is


Amazon,
 folks.
 Apparently,
 Amazon
 is
 uh


well,
 they're
 downsizing.
 Report
 says


they
 are
 highlighting
 30,000


corporate
 jobs
 being
 cut.
 And
 this
 might


not
 be
 due
 necessarily
 to
 AI
 because
 if


it
 is
 that's
 kind
 of
 scary
 to
 be
 honest.


Uh
 but
 it
 might
 be
 more
 due
 to
 just


organizational
 restructuring.
 A
 little


bit
 of
 coverage
 on
 this
 and
 then
 uh
 then


we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there


>> too
 in
 in
 coming
 months.
 That's
 that's


Steve
 Leeman
 for
 joining
 us
 now
 with


more
 reaction.
 Intelligent
 Alpha's
 Doug


Clinton.
 This


>> is
 largely
 Amazon
 taking
 a
 look
 at
 its


workforce
 and
 seeing
 where
 it
 can
 be


more
 efficient.
 You
 know,
 something


interesting
 has
 happened
 with
 this


moment
 where
 everybody's
 talking
 about


whether
 AI
 can
 replace
 jobs.
 Companies


by
 and
 large
 have
 looked
 and
 they've


said,
 "Where
 are
 the
 places
 where
 we


might
 need
 maybe
 two
 employees
 working


instead
 of
 five?"
 And
 they've
 decided
 to


cut
 there.
 They've
 also
 used
 AI
 as
 an


excuse
 uh
 as
 a
 excuse
 for
 when
 they're


suffering
 or
 not
 doing
 great
 in
 certain


business
 units
 and
 need
 to
 um
 cut
 down.


And
 they
 say
 they
 say,
 "Well,
 we're


going
 to
 look
 at
 AI
 to
 make
 us
 more


efficient."
 Uh
 where
 they
 just
 needed
 to


do
 layoffs
 anyway.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that's


exactly
 what's
 happening
 with
 Amazon,


but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 this
 is
 following
 a


trend
 of
 many
 companies
 within
 the


economy,
 either
 slowering
 hiring
 or


cutting
 workforce
 and,
 you
 know,
 maybe


winking
 at
 the
 fact
 that
 it's
 AI
 like


Jasse
 might
 have
 done
 with
 his
 uh
 letter


uh
 that
 he
 wrote
 earlier
 this
 year.
 Um


where
 when
 you
 look
 at
 it,
 you
 don't
 see


onetoone
 automation
 of
 jobs.
 So
 for
 me,


>> so
 what
 do
 we
 think
 folks?
 I
 mean,
 look,


as
 an
 Amazon
 shareholder,
 obviously
 it,


you
 know,
 if
 you
 cut
 jobs,
 you
 cut


costs,
 you
 cut
 expenses,
 that's
 good


for,
 uh,
 net
 income
 margins,
 good
 for


operating
 income
 margins,
 obviously
 good


for
 EPS
 growth.
 Amazon
 right
 there
 up


1.3%
 on
 the
 day.
 But
 I
 am
 curious
 why


exactly
 they
 are
 trying
 to
 go
 for
 30,000


jobs.
 Wow,
 look
 at
 Apple.
 This
 is


probably
 another
 reason
 why
 the
 S&P
 is


moving.
 Apple
 right
 there
 268,
 S&P
 685.


Oh
 my
 goodness.
 685.


Dude,


the
 Bulls
 are
 winning.
 It's
 just
 that


simple.
 The
 Bulls
 are
 winning.
 They
 had


a
 little
 bit
 of a
 hiccup
 on
 October


10th.
 A
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 $20
 billion


crypto
 liquidation
 hiccup.
 But
 then
 what


did
 the
 Bulls
 do?
 They
 bought
 the
 dip.


Bank
 of
 America
 said
 Friday,
 October


10th
 was
 the
 fifth
 largest
 inflow
 for


single
 stocks
 in
 history.
 I
 mean,
 they


bought
 the
 dip.
 68
 million
 calls
 were


traded
 that
 day.
 A
 lot
 of
 those
 likely


on
 the
 buy
 side
 as
 um
 as
 we
 had
 any


momentum
 to
 the
 downside.
 So
 685
 right


there
 on
 the
 S&P
 500.
 My
 goodness,


that's
 five
 bucks
 away
 from
 690.
 Less


than
 2%
 away
 from
 7,000
 on
 the
 S&P.


Absolutely
 incredible.
 You
 got
 Apple


right
 here
 helping
 to
 contribute.
 Apple


potentially
 going
 for
 270.
 26840.
 That's


up
 another
 2%
 of the
 day.
 Apple's
 a
 big


company,
 so
 2%
 on
 Apple
 really
 does


matter.
 Tesla
 right
 here
 452.
 AMD
 that's


up
 2.3.
 And
 then
 SoFi
 trying
 to
 get
 that


$30
 close.
 The
 Q's
 628
 alltime
 high
 on


the
 Q's
 up
 1.8%


continuing
 to
 make
 a
 move.
 You
 got


Google.
 Are
 we
 touching
 270
 yet?
 On
 the


Googs,
 we
 are
 very
 close
 to
 touching


270,
 but
 Google
 and
 Apple
 moving.
 Both


of
 them
 big
 parts
 of
 the
 S&P
 500
 along


with
 Nvidia.
 I
 mean,
 Nvidia's
 up
 3%.


19142.
 Had
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 hiccup
 after
 that


Qualcomm
 news
 came
 out,
 but
 markets


didn't
 care
 too
 much.
 And
 that's
 why
 you


got
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 at
 191.
 Is
 Apple


at
 4
 trillion?
 Is
 Apple
 at
 4
 trillion?


Apple's
 really
 close,
 guys.
 It's


probably
 what,
 40
 cents
 away.
 Not
 even
 a


full
 dollar
 away
 in
 terms
 of
 share
 price


to
 getting
 to
 4
 trillion.
 3.984


trillion.


Dude,
 if
 we
 see
 uh
 two4
 trillion


companies
 in
 2025,
 I
 mean,
 what
 a


remarkable
 period
 to
 live
 through
 as


investors.
 What
 a
 remarkable
 period
 to


live
 through
 as
 investors.
 Tim
 Apple,


baby.
 Tim
 Apple
 lemonade.
 Is
 that


moving?
 Lemonade
 is
 green.
 Wow.
 11%
 on


the
 day.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Some
 of
 the


insurance
 names
 picking
 up
 a
 little bit.


Oscar
 right
 there.
 That's
 also
 up
 2%.


Maybe
 some
 capitulation
 on
 the
 shutdown,


which
 is
 getting
 some
 of
 these
 names


excited.
 UNH
 was
 red
 in
 the
 morning.
 UNH


ended
 up
 going
 green.
 UNH
 ended
 up
 going


green.
 Where
 is
 the
 fear
 and
 greed


index?
 That's
 a
 good
 question.
 Fear
 and


greed
 right
 here.
 Wow.
 We
 are
 still
 at


fear.
 We
 are
 still
 at
 fear.
 All-time


highs
 on
 the
 market
 by
 a
 pretty
 wide


margin.
 It's
 not
 just
 the
 small
 all-time


high.
 The
 previous
 alltime
 high
 was


673.95.
 We
 are
 at
 685


and
 still
 have
 fear.
 I
 mean
 what
 does


greed
 look
 like?
 Is
 greed
 gonna
 be
 7100


7200
 or
 something?
 Because
 if
 that's
 the


case,
 we
 got
 a
 long
 way
 to
 go
 folks.


We
 have
 got
 a
 long
 way
 to
 go
 to
 see
 how


this
 plays
 out.
 Even
 Nebus
 making
 a


move.
 Nebius,
 Cory,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 data


center
 names.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Nebas
 right


there.
 125.
 That's
 up
 8%
 on
 the
 day.


Cororeeve
 that's
 up
 2%
 135.
 IN
 uh
 also


doing
 well
 up
 3%.
 Not
 all
 the
 Bitcoin


miners
 went
 green
 today.
 You
 got


Terowolf,
 Hive,
 Bit
 Farms,
 and
 Cipher


that
 went
 down,
 but
 Clean
 Spark's
 up.
 I


ran
 is
 up.
 Marathon's
 up.
 Riots's
 up.


Galaxy
 ups.
 So,
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of these


names
 that
 are
 still
 going
 green
 as


well,
 which
 is
 not


is
 not
 too
 bad.
 Again,
 I
 think
 the
 story


of
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 really
 has
 been


earnings
 progression,
 and
 we're
 going
 to


get
 a
 lot
 more
 earnings
 on
 Wednesday,


and
 we're
 going to
 see
 how
 the
 story


plays
 out.
 But
 the
 banks
 have
 crushed


it,
 consumer
 companies
 have
 crushed
 it,


uh
 restaurants
 have
 not
 been
 too
 bad.


So,
 if
 that
 can
 continue,
 that
 is
 more


of
 a
 reason
 for
 the
 market
 to
 expand
 its


multiple.
 Not
 to
 mention
 the
 fact
 we've


got
 a
 rate
 cut
 coming
 up
 pretty
 soon.


That's
 going
 to
 be
 on
 Wednesday.
 And
 I


think
 the
 markets
 are
 also
 getting
 ready


for
 what
 that
 rate
 cut
 is
 going
 to
 look


like.
 Again,
 the
 big
 story
 of
 the
 day


was
 Amazon
 and
 that
 30,000
 uh
 job
 cut.


We're
 going
 to
 get
 more
 details
 on
 that


probably
 over
 the
 coming
 weeks.
 But
 you


do,
 and
 these
 are
 corporate
 jobs.
 These


aren't
 people
 in
 the
 factories
 in
 the


warehouses.
 So
 these
 are
 more
 so
 like


white
 collar
 jobs
 that
 Amazon
 is


thinking
 of
 getting
 rid
 of,
 which
 again


would
 be
 a
 total
 restructuring
 of
 their


organization.
 Tesla,
 by
 the
 way,
 Wales


bought
 millions
 worth
 of
 calls
 today
 and


over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 We've
 been


eyeing
 that
 525
 to
 550
 strike
 for


November
 2025.
 A
 lot
 more
 of
 the
 560s


were
 bought
 today
 for
 June
 2026.


So
 you've
 got
 a
 decent
 amount
 of
 people


buying
 up
 those
 Tesla
 calls.
 Now
 again,


Tesla
 earnings
 wasn't
 the
 best,
 but
 at


the
 end
 of the
 day,
 there's
 not
 that


many
 ways
 to
 get
 exposure
 to
 AI
 in
 the


way
 that
 Tesla
 gives
 you
 exposure.
 And


it
 seems
 like
 the
 street
 doesn't
 care.


Also,
 the
 upgrades
 that
 Tesla's
 been


getting
 even
 after
 those
 earnings
 have


been
 relatively
 bullish
 across
 the


board.
 They
 got
 upgraded
 by
 Caner
 today


to
 510
 from
 385.
 So,
 you're
 getting
 a


lot
 more
 people
 just
 saying,
 "Look,
 we


really
 don't
 care
 that
 the
 numbers
 are


not
 that
 good.
 We
 don't
 care
 that


there's
 negative
 earnings
 growth.
 just


care
 that
 this
 story
 is
 going
 to
 play


out
 the
 way
 we
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 play


out
 and
 we're
 willing
 to
 subsidize
 the


story
 with
 a
 lack
 of
 profits
 today
 for


exponentially
 more
 profits
 in
 the


future.


And
 that's
 why
 Tesla's
 green
 AMD
 right


there
 260
 S&P
 68542


basically
 high
 of
 day.
 We
 got
 three


minutes
 left
 until
 the
 market
 closes.


S&P
 is
 really
 going
 for
 it
 right
 now.


Absolutely
 incredible.
 AMD
 260.
 We
 did


hit
 uh
 two
 Oh,
 no.
 That's
 an
 alltime


high.


I
 thought,
 why
 did
 I
 think
 we
 were
 Oh,
 I


was
 thinking
 of
 Google.
 Above
 260.
 Wow.


That's
 an
 all-time
 high
 for
 AMD.
 If
 it


closes
 at
 260,
 it's
 at
 259.80
 right


here.
 That
 is
 an
 all-time
 high
 for
 AMD.


My
 Some
 of
 these
 stocks,
 it's
 hard
 to


keep
 up
 with
 their
 all-time
 highs.
 Apple


right
 there
 268.88.
 Is
 Apple
 at
 4


trillion
 yet?
 Apple
 is
 at
 3.984.
 Apple


still
 below.
 No,
 no,
 Apple
 3.991.


If
 it's
 not
 today,
 it's
 probably
 going


to
 be
 this
 week.
 as
 long
 as
 they
 can


have
 a
 good
 earnings.
 Apple's
 going
 to


four
 trill.
 Microsoft
 as
 well.
 Yeah.


3.954.
 Microsoft's
 not
 uh
 not
 that
 far


behind.


>> Wow.
 What
 a
 day,
 guys.
 What
 a
 freaking


day.
 My
 It's
 one
 of
 those
 days
 that


probably
 recouped
 a
 lot
 of
 portfolios


that
 were
 struggling
 over
 the
 past


couple
 days.
 Apple
 right
 there
 trying
 to


hit
 269.
 It
 did
 hit
 269
 and
 you're


continuing
 to
 see
 this
 move.
 Yeah,
 price


discovery
 across
 the
 board
 is
 also


something
 that
 we're
 seeing.
 Oracle


right
 there
 281.
 That's
 slightly
 down
 on


the
 day.
 Nvidia
 still
 up
 2.83.
 So
 the


earnings
 watch
 list
 we
 have
 is
 Cadence.


That's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 one.
 And
 then


NXP.


What's
 today?
 10:27
 earnings.
 So
 we
 have


CDNS.


We
 have
 NXPI.


Um
 the
 other
 one
 we
 have
 is
 Confluence


CLT.
 And
 then
 we
 got
 Amcor.
 So
 these
 are


the
 ones
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 looking
 at


in
 regards
 to.


All
 right,
 here
 we
 go.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here
 again.
 Thank


you
 for
 all
 the
 birthday
 wishes
 as
 well.


We'll
 uh
 do
 some
 fun
 birthday
 stuff


after
 we
 get
 through
 the
 close.
 We'll


have
 Steve
 on
 to
 the
 show.
 But
 deeply


deeply
 appreciate
 everyone
 that's
 here.


Uh
 pretty
 pretty
 incredible
 day
 and
 it


is
 very
 very
 nice
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 this


market
 momentum
 after
 the
 past
 couple


weeks
 we
 had
 where
 all
 of
 us
 felt
 the


pain
 and
 got
 to
 go
 through
 some
 of
 the


pain
 to
 get
 the
 gains.
 And
 it
 looks
 like


today
 might
 be
 that
 day
 for
 gains
 after


a
 couple
 weeks
 of
 pain.
 So
 there
 we
 go.


Yes,
 Celestica
 as
 well.
 We'll
 look
 at


Celestea
 and
 we'll
 put
 that
 on
 the
 list


for
 the
 earnings
 that
 we
 got.
 All right,


here
 we
 go.
 Thank
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 Monday,
 October
 27th.


I
 am
 now
 28
 years
 old
 and
 the
 stock


market
 is
 now
 closed.


All
 right,
 there
 you
 go.
 We
 are
 done
 for


the
 day.
 Paler
 did
 not
 give
 us
 the
 190


close,
 but
 we
 got
 to
 192
 at
 one
 point.


19283.
 Closed
 at
 189.
 I'll
 take
 it.
 I


will
 take
 it.
 Again,
 pounder
 signed
 that


letter
 of
 intent
 with
 the
 defense


ministry
 of
 Poland.
 Lumen
 contract
 was


$200
 million.
 So
 you
 had
 a
 lot
 of


different
 catalysts
 going
 the
 right


direction
 for
 pounder
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks.
 18914
 on
 pounder.
 That's


up
 2.44%
 on
 the
 day.
 Robin
 Hood
 ends
 out


the
 day
 at
 4%
 almost
 was
 at
 149
 closed


at
 146.
 Tessy
 great
 day
 4%
 452.
 Nvidia


back
 into
 the
 190s
 2.8%.
 S&P
 500
 closes


above
 685.


Again,
 if
 I
 if
 you've
 been
 bearish,
 it's


really
 hard
 to
 see
 that
 with
 all
 the


bearish
 arguments
 one
 could
 make
 to
 see


the
 S&P
 go
 not
 only
 at
 an
 all-time
 high,


but
 a,
 you
 know,
 a
 real
 uh
 degree
 of


magnitude
 of
 above
 alltime
 highs
 or
 at


least
 above
 the
 previous
 all-time
 highs.


It's
 quite
 incredible.
 And
 then
 you've


got
 the
 Fed
 cutting
 rates
 and
 earnings


coming
 up.
 The
 most
 important
 companies


in
 the
 S&P
 500,
 43%
 of
 them
 are


reporting
 earnings
 this
 week.
 But
 the


most
 important
 ones,
 aka
 the
 MAX
 7,
 are


reporting
 in
 two
 days.
 If
 they
 deliver


good
 earnings,
 I
 mean,
 who
 knows,
 dude.


Who
 knows?
 Maybe
 that
 7,000
 is
 not
 that


far
 away
 as
 you've
 got
 rate
 cuts
 coming


down
 the
 corner
 and
 then
 you
 got


earnings
 growth
 potentially
 leading
 to


more
 momentum.
 AMD
 closes
 at
 an
 all-time


high
 or
 just
 below
 an
 all-time
 high
 at


2.68%
 259.
 SoFi
 got
 the
 $30
 close
 not


too
 bad
 finally
 $30
 close
 for
 SoFi.


Google
 268.95
 just
 below
 269.
 Grab
 got


that
 611.
 Grab
 was
 at
 540
 last
 week.
 So


again
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 names
 it
 was
 on
 sale


and
 for
 those
 that
 took
 advantage
 of
 it


not
 too
 bad.
 Reddit
 that's
 up
 2.3%.


Amazon's
 up
 1.3%.
 Meta
 was
 up
 1.6.
 MeteX


to
 750
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 3
 months.


ELF
 that's
 up
 2.74.
 Apple
 26878


basically
 an
 all-time
 high
 on
 the
 close.


SMCI
 as
 well
 up
 7%.
 BMR
 did
 we
 get
 54?


We
 got
 5360


for
 BMR
 6.32%


which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.
 Iran
 was
 up
 3%.


Fizer
 was
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 BABA
 was
 up


2.4.
 The
 VIX
 was
 down
 4%
 on
 the
 day.


Very
 good
 for
 equities.
 Lyft
 was
 up
 half


a
 percent.
 And
 then
 gold
 was
 down
 in
 the


morning.
 Gold
 still
 down
 basically
 3%


down
 in
 the
 day.
 $
 39.91
 on
 gold,
 4678


on
 silver,
 and
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 All


right,
 earnings.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it.
 What


do
 we
 got?
 What
 do
 we
 have
 on
 earnings?


Let's
 get
 into
 it.


Amcor
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 green


after
 hours.
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 results


yet.
 Confluent
 is
 up
 or
 Confluent's


down.
 NXPI
 is
 flat.
 And
 then
 Cadence
 is


slightly
 flat.
 Uh
 Celestica
 is
 another


one
 we
 have.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 get


these
 numbers.


Oh,
 we
 have
 Whirlpool
 today.
 Okay,
 I'll


put
 that
 on
 the
 list
 as
 well.
 Uh,


that'll
 be
 important
 for
 the
 consumer.


Amcore
 trying
 to
 push
 34
 right
 here.


Don't
 have
 the
 numbers,
 but
 let
 me
 get


them
 in
 a
 second


and
 see


what
 we've
 got.
 Let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat


which
 one
 of
 these
 names
 people
 own.


Again,
 tomorrow
 is
 going to
 be
 the
 big


day.
 I'll
 be
 live
 in
 the
 morning
 with


Steve
 for
 SoFi.
 That
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


massive,
 massive
 day.


And
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


Okay,
 Cadence.
 I
 got
 Cadence.
 Here
 we


go.
 Cadence
 beat
 EPS
 193,
 up
 from
 17%
 on


a
 beat
 year-over-year.
 And
 then
 revenue


1.39
 billion.
 Cadence
 looks
 like
 they


beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 Uh,
 this


one
 is
 slightly
 flat
 after
 hours
 to
 red.


It's
 a
 very
 slight
 red.
 Nothing
 too


crazy,


but
 that
 is
 great.
 But
 that
 is
 a
 beat
 on


the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.


Beat
 by
 8%
 and
 then
 beat
 by
 1%.
 193


versus
 179.
 1.3
 versus
 1.32
 billion.


Revenue
 is
 up
 10%
 year-over-year.
 EPS
 is


up
 18%
 year-over-year.
 These
 guys
 do


chip
 design.
 It's
 an
 important
 company.


Market
 cap
 is
 200
 or
 95
 billion.
 Um,
 so


you
 know,
 $100
 billion
 company,
 not
 a


small
 company
 by
 any
 means,
 but
 that
 one


is
 slightly
 up.
 NXPI,
 don't
 have
 those


results
 yet.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 get
 some
 of


these
 other
 results.
 No,
 I
 don't
 have


anything
 else.
 Waste
 management
 happens


later
 in
 the
 day.
 Happens
 at
 like
 6
 p.m.


So,
 not
 really
 seeing
 that
 yet.
 Amcore,


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 dip.
 You
 got
 a
 red


candle
 right
 there.
 Don't
 have
 those


results
 yet
 either.
 See
 if
 we
 can
 get


these
 results.


And


then
 we'll
 see.
 Do
 I
 have
 this?


I
 think
 I
 have
 this.
 Okay.
 Net
 income
 or


net
 sales
 1.99
 billion.
 Gross
 profit
 284


million.
 Operating
 income
 159.
 Net


income
 127.
 EPS
 of
 51
 cents.
 I
 think


that
 came
 in
 line
 with
 expectations.


EBID
 of
 340
 million.
 stock
 is
 basically


flat
 3215
 not
 really
 seeing
 a
 big
 move


up
 or
 down.
 Confluent
 that's
 up
 7%.
 I'll


get
 more
 on
 those
 results
 in
 a
 second,


but
 Amcor
 being
 relatively
 flat.


Confluent
 that's
 up
 9%
 that
 one
 moving.


Royal
 pool
 that's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 CLS


Celestica
 is
 moving
 as
 well.
 And
 then


NXPI


that
 is
 also
 up
 half%.
 Yeah,
 Amcore
 got


a
 double
 beat.
 CEO
 says
 Amcor
 delivered


third
 quarter
 revenue
 of
 1.9
 billion
 up


31%
 fueled
 by
 demand
 for
 advanced


packaging
 which
 set
 a
 new
 revenue


record.
 This
 quarter,
 we
 executed
 steep


production
 ramps,
 achieved
 record


revenue
 in
 our
 communications
 and


computing
 and
 markets,
 and
 broke
 ground


on
 our
 new
 advanced
 packaging
 and
 test


campus
 in
 Arizona,
 reinforcing
 our


commitment
 to
 enable
 our
 customers


technology
 roadmaps
 and
 strengthen
 US


semiconductor
 manufacturing.


Uh
 CEO
 will
 also
 be
 going
 through
 a


succession
 plan.
 So,
 it
 looks
 like


they're
 going to
 be
 putting
 someone
 else


in
 the
 CEO
 position.
 But
 you
 got
 to
 beat


on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 Stock
 is
 up


and
 down,
 up
 and
 down.
 Not
 really
 making


a
 big
 move.
 Basically
 flat.
 I
 mean,
 it


was
 at
 33
 the
 whole
 day.
 Now
 it's
 at
 33


after
 hours.
 But
 you
 do
 have
 a
 pretty


big
 beat.
 And
 then
 Confluent,
 that's
 up


9%.


That
 is
 up
 9%.


This
 is
 another
 software
 name
 that


potentially
 was
 going
 to
 be
 acquired


earlier
 this
 year,
 but
 it
 looks
 like


that's
 holding
 on.
 Uh
 F5,
 they
 also
 had


earnings
 today,
 439
 versus
 397.
 That's
 a


beat
 by
 11%.
 And
 then
 revenue
 is
 up
 8%


uh
 on
 the
 year.
 I'm
 actually
 not
 too


familiar
 with
 this
 company.
 F5
 FFIV.


This
 stock
 year-to
 date
 17
 billion


company's
 up
 15%.


Cloud
 application
 security
 online
 fraud


pre
 prevention.
 Okay,
 maybe
 a
 sub
 branch


of
 cyber
 security,
 but
 that
 stock
 up


15%.


That
 stock
 up
 15%.
 Network
 plus
 cyber.


All right.
 Well,
 that
 one
 moving
 a


little
 bit
 after
 hours
 with
 a
 bit
 of
 a


beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 Cadence


now
 down
 2%.
 Worldpool
 and
 Celestica,


those
 slightly
 green
 as
 well.
 Pretty


much
 everything
 is
 double
 beating.
 Yeah,


pretty
 much
 everything
 across
 the
 board.


Whether
 you
 own
 it
 or
 not,
 it
 is
 nice
 to


see
 that
 you're
 getting
 some
 beats
 and


you,
 you
 know,
 you
 kind
 of
 need
 these


beats
 to
 continue
 up.
 Galaxy
 just


offered
 a
 billion
 dollars
 in


exchangeable
 notes.
 Is
 that
 stock


tanking
 or
 is
 the
 market
 okay
 with
 it?


Galaxy,
 it's
 down.
 Not
 down
 like
 crazy,


but
 it's
 down.
 Galaxy
 is
 down
 3.3%.


Legend
 doesn't
 show
 you,
 but
 on
 Weeble


it
 shows
 down
 3.3%.
 A
 billion
 in
 equity.


Didn't
 these
 guys
 already
 do
 a
 capital


raise?
 Galaxy
 Digital
 offer
 a
 billion
 of


exchangeable
 senior
 notes
 due
 May
 1st,


2031.
 Option
 for
 initial
 purchasers
 to


buy
 an
 additional
 150
 million
 proceeds


to
 fund
 business
 growth,
 general


corporate
 purposes,
 and
 potential


repayment
 of
 2026
 notes.


Okay.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 if
 the
 demand
 is


as
 strong
 as
 it
 is
 for
 data
 centers,


then
 diluting
 by
 a
 billion
 shouldn't


necessarily
 affect
 shareholders
 that


much,
 but
 that
 stock
 is
 down


a
 bit


uh
 a
 bit
 after
 hours.
 Uh,
 Rambus
 is


down.
 Rambus
 is
 an
 American
 technology


company
 that
 develops
 and
 licensed
 chip


interface
 technologies
 and
 architectures


that
 are
 used
 in
 digital
 electronic


products.
 I
 didn't
 even
 know
 they
 had


earnings,
 but
 let's
 take
 a
 look
 at
 them.


Oh
 boy.
 Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.


You're
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 beating
 right


there.
 Let
 me
 pull
 up
 those
 numbers
 and


see
 if
 they
 missed
 it.
 Let's
 also
 get


some
 coverage
 on
 some
 of
 these
 other


names,
 but
 Rambus
 is
 down


the
 day.
 Bit
 mine
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 as


well.
 Uh,
 is
 Ethereum
 moving
 down?
 Bit


mine
 uh
 53.
 Nothing
 too
 crazy.
 Ethereum


was
 at
 4200.
 Ethereum
 right
 here
 4157.


Get
 a
 little bit
 of
 a
 beating


on
 Ethereum.
 Okay,
 so
 Amcore
 is
 flat.
 I


I
 mean
 it
 looks
 like
 a
 pretty
 good


earnings
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom,
 but


Street's
 not
 caring
 too
 much.
 Amcor
 more


so
 is
 a
 six
 to
 12
 month
 play
 on
 a


rerating
 from
 for
 their
 sales
 multiple


as
 they
 increase
 growth.
 Looks
 like
 they


had
 the
 best
 quarter
 in
 history
 in
 Q3.


So
 the
 market
 is
 not
 upset,
 but
 the


market's
 not
 super
 excited
 about
 that.


Rambus
 right
 here,
 they
 missed
 by
 14%
 on


EPS.
 44
 cents
 versus
 51
 cents
 expected.


178
 versus
 175
 million
 revenue.
 They


beat
 by
 2%.


Okay,
 so
 Rambus
 did
 not
 have
 a
 double


meep.
 This
 one's
 getting
 hit.
 And
 yeah,


an
 Amcor
 Street
 wanted
 1.932.
 They
 came


in
 at
 1.9
 EPS.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 the
 street


wanted
 43
 cents.
 They
 came
 in
 at
 51.


It's
 a
 decent
 beat.
 It's
 a
 decent
 beat.


I
 mean,
 if
 you
 own
 the
 stock,
 you're


probably
 not
 too
 upset
 at
 the
 earnings.


It's
 just
 the
 street's
 not
 overly


enthusiastic.
 Also,
 this
 name
 doesn't


have
 a
 ton
 of
 liquidity.
 It
 doesn't
 have


a
 ton
 of
 volume.
 So
 realistically,
 it's


more
 so
 them
 just
 having
 to
 keep


executing
 and
 eventually
 the
 numbers


catch
 up
 with
 the
 with
 the
 stock
 price


as
 well.
 Rambus,
 that
 one
 is
 the
 one


getting
 hit.
 Cadence
 also,
 you
 know,


double
 beat,
 but
 Cadence
 not
 really


getting
 any
 love
 or
 hate
 from
 the


street.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of these
 names


that
 are
 up
 for
 the
 year,
 they're
 not


getting
 hit
 that
 bad.
 Whirlpool,
 this


will
 tell
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 about
 the


consumer.
 I
 don't
 see
 their
 earnings


yet.
 That
 one
 I
 am
 definitely
 interested


in.
 Lots
 of
 dishes
 and
 washing
 machines


is
 what
 you
 would
 see.
 Oh
 my,
 that's
 a


hell
 of
 a
 beat.


Wow.
 Whirlpool
 3.92
 billion.
 They
 came


in
 at
 4.03.


So
 they
 beat
 on
 revenue.
 They
 achieved


50
 million
 in
 quarterly
 cost
 reductions.


Uh
 adjusted
 EPS
 was
 $29
 versus
 a
 $143


expected.


I
 mean,
 dude,
 that
 is
 not
 a
 bad
 quarter,


especially
 because
 they
 are
 also
 prone


to
 tariffs.
 The
 stock
 is
 already
 down


35%
 year-to
 date.
 So,
 any
 piece
 of
 good


news
 would
 be
 good
 for
 them.
 Again,
 a


lot
 of
 the
 tariffs
 probably
 are


affecting
 their
 cost
 of
 goods
 across
 the


world,
 especially
 in
 China.


Those
 are
 some
 pretty
 deep
 numbers.


Those
 are
 some
 pretty
 pretty
 good


numbers.
 Galaxy's
 down
 7%.
 All right,


let
 me
 put
 up
 Weeble
 because
 Legend
 is


still
 not
 showing
 the
 after
 hours
 move,


so
 it's
 hard
 to
 kind
 of
 see,
 but
 yeah,


you
 are
 right.
 Galaxy
 down
 8%
 on
 the


offering.
 That's
 the
 other
 thing
 about


these
 stocks
 that
 have
 run
 a
 lot.
 I


mean,
 you
 cannot
 blame
 them
 for
 doing
 an


offering
 because
 to
 them,
 they're
 like,


"Hey,
 we're
 up
 150%.
 If
 someone's
 upset


about
 150%
 thinking
 that's
 not


shareholder
 friendly
 or
 that
 we
 don't


care
 about
 shareholder
 returns,
 then


essentially
 they're
 going
 to
 say
 screw


you."
 Right?
 Like
 the
 stock's
 up
 150%


for
 the
 year.
 You
 just
 can't
 be
 that


upset.
 So
 to
 them,
 they're
 like,
 "All


right,
 we
 need
 to
 take
 advantage
 of
 this


150%
 move
 and
 we
 need
 to
 raise
 some


capital."
 It
 it's
 very
 smart
 for
 these


companies
 to
 do.
 Obviously,
 it's
 not
 the


most
 shareholder
 friendly,
 but
 then
 they


look
 at
 their
 stock
 and
 they're
 like,


"Well,
 if
 our
 stock's
 not
 going
 to
 go


down
 150%,
 then,
 you
 know,
 it's
 probably


something
 that
 most
 shareholders
 can't


be
 too
 upset
 about,
 but
 the
 but
 the


stock
 is
 tanking
 on
 this
 news,
 down
 9%."


I
 think
 this
 one
 gets
 eaten
 up.
 I
 mean,


I
 don't
 know
 if
 the
 street
 gets
 that


upset
 about
 this.
 We
 saw
 Iran
 do
 this
 a


couple
 weeks
 ago.
 We
 saw
 Bit
 Farms
 do


this
 literally
 last
 week.
 They
 did
 a


$300
 million
 convertible
 note.
 Now,
 that


Bit
 Farms
 hasn't
 been
 able
 to
 recover


since
 then,
 but
 Galaxy
 is
 a
 bit
 more


advanced
 than
 Bit
 Farms.


That
 one
 is
 slightly
 down.
 NXPI
 is
 up.


Okay,
 NXPI.


Let's
 see.
 This
 is
 another
 semiconductor


company.
 $55
 billion
 market
 cap.
 That


one
 is
 also
 flat.


That
 one
 is
 also
 flat.
 Looks
 like


earnings


EPS
 is
 $311.
 That's
 down
 9%


year-over-year.
 Revenue,
 they
 missed
 as


well.
 3.017
 billion,
 down
 7.2%.


Okay,
 so
 you
 got
 a
 miss
 on
 the
 top
 and


the
 bottom
 it
 looks
 like
 for
 NXP.


markets
 not
 giving
 them
 too
 much
 hate


for
 that.


Actually,
 no.
 They
 beat
 on
 revenue.
 It's


a
 very
 slight
 beat
 on
 revenue,
 but
 they


did
 beat
 on
 revenue.
 They
 did
 miss
 on


EPS.
 EPS,
 they
 missed
 311
 versus
 312.


Again,
 also
 a
 slight
 miss.
 That's
 not
 a


crazy
 miss.
 And
 then
 revenue
 3.1
 versus


3.16.
 EPS
 is
 down
 10%.
 Year-over-year


revenue
 is
 down
 2%.


Market's
 not
 caring
 too
 much.


Amcor
 did
 have
 earnings.
 They
 beat
 on


the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 best
 quarter
 in


history
 from
 revenue
 perspective.
 Uh


guidance
 looks
 pretty
 legit
 as
 well.
 I'm


trying
 to
 get
 the
 official
 results.
 Let


me
 go
 to
 their
 website,
 see
 if
 we
 have


those.
 But
 street
 not
 really
 caring
 too


much.


Yeah,
 this
 is
 what
 you're
 looking
 at.


These
 were
 the
 results
 right
 here.


Almost
 2
 billion
 in
 revenue,
 gross


profit
 284
 million,
 net
 income
 127.
 EPS


street
 thought
 would
 come
 in
 at
 43


cents.
 They
 came
 in
 at
 51
 cents.
 I
 mean,


again,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies
 beating


on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 It's
 just
 a


question
 of
 if
 they're
 if
 the
 street's


willing
 to
 give
 them


a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 multiple
 for
 what


we
 got
 right
 now.


Uh,
 okay.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 some


coverage
 on
 some
 of
 these
 other
 names


and
 then
 we'll
 take
 a
 look
 at
 some
 of


the
 headlines.
 First,
 let's
 do


Whirlpool.
 We
 got
 this
 right
 here.
 Let's


pull
 this
 one
 up.
 Looks
 like
 they
 also


beat
 on
 most
 of
 their
 estimates
 as
 well.


All
 right,
 here
 we
 go.


>> Whirlpool
 earnings
 are
 out
 and
 it's
 a


big
 beat
 on
 earnings.
 Revenue
 also


coming
 in
 better
 than
 expected.
 Company


also
 raising
 guidance
 for
 the
 full
 year,


saying
 it
 is
 navigating
 the
 near-term


unfavorable
 effects
 of
 tariffs.
 In


particular,
 saying
 it's
 being
 impacted


by
 inventory
 loading
 from
 Asian


competitors.
 You
 can
 see
 those
 shares


are
 up
 about
 1%
 right
 now.
 Well,
 while


stocks
 rallied
 to
 record
 highs,
 bond


yields
 did
 hold
 steady.
 The
 10-year


yield
 sticking
 to
 4%
 just
 below


>> 10year
 still
 at
 4%.
 Whirlpool.
 Okay,
 so


guidance
 wasn't
 the
 best
 for
 Whirlpool,


but
 top
 and
 the
 bottom
 beats
 were


decent.
 Uh
 CLS,
 Celestica,
 haven't
 seen


those
 earnings
 yet.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can


get
 Celestica,


but
 we
 didn't
 get
 those
 numbers
 yet.


Well,
 also
 missed,
 this
 is
 another


company.
 Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up.
 Uh,
 Well,


Tower,


they
 missed
 pretty
 badly.
 I
 actually


don't
 know
 what
 this
 company
 does.
 41


cents
 versus
 51
 cents.
 That's
 a
 miss
 by


20%.
 Revenue
 missed
 by
 1%.
 They're
 doing


2.7
 billion
 in
 revenue.
 So,
 I
 would


imagine


this
 is
 a
 relevant
 company.
 $122
 billion


market
 cap.
 Real
 estate
 investment


trusts
 that
 invest
 in
 healthcare


infrastructure.


Is
 this
 just
 a
 REIT?
 It's
 a
 46.
 I
 don't


know.
 I've
 heard
 of
 the
 word
 Well
 tower,


but
 I
 feel
 like
 Steve
 has
 talked
 about


these
 guys
 before.


It's
 not
 doing
 well,
 that's
 for
 sure.


Yeah,
 it's
 not
 necessarily
 doing
 well.


Uh
 that's
 not
 Well,
 it's
 flat
 after


hours.
 It's
 up
 50%
 for
 the
 year
 and
 it's


and
 it's
 not
 even
 moving
 after
 hours.


So,


you're
 not
 getting
 a
 crazy
 move.
 Dude,
 a


lot
 of
 these
 names
 not
 really
 giving
 you


any
 volatility.


Celestica,


is
 that
 one
 moving
 just
 now?
 Celestea,
 I


think
 that
 one's
 moving.
 Okay.
 Boom.


You're
 just
 getting
 a
 move
 right
 now


after
 hours
 on
 Celestica
 5%.
 I
 think


their
 earnings
 just
 came
 out.
 So,


Celestea
 giving
 you
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move,
 but


everything
 else
 been
 relatively
 flat.


Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 get
 those
 numbers


and
 see
 what
 we've
 got.
 SMCI
 at
 53.
 I


mean,
 SMCI
 was
 I
 feel
 like
 SMCI
 was


going
 to
 recover
 again.
 Like,
 if
 we
 saw


the
 announcement
 when
 they
 fell
 to
 47


last
 week,
 they
 didn't
 decrease
 their


guidance
 for
 the
 fiscal
 year
 and
 they


didn't
 say
 they
 had
 a
 demand
 issue.
 It


was
 just
 like
 some
 logistical
 reason
 for


why
 they
 had
 to
 push
 out
 some
 of
 the


revenue
 into
 Q2.
 So
 I
 mean
 that
 that
 one


recovering
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 to
 be


honest.
 5287
 up
 from
 47.95.
 Celestea
 is


down
 10%.
 Okay,
 so
 this
 is
 your
 big


mover
 after
 hours.
 We
 haven't
 really
 had


a
 big
 move
 besides
 this
 stock.
 Year
 to


date,
 Celestea
 is
 up
 224%.
 They're
 a


Canadian
 multinational
 design


manufacturing
 hardware
 platform.
 Market


cap
 is
 35
 billion.
 They're
 from
 Toronto.


I
 didn't
 know
 that.


Wow.
 Most
 most
 companies
 in
 Canada
 that


most
 most
 of
 us
 know
 are
 like
 the


Shopifies
 of
 the
 world.
 There
 you
 go.


Okay,
 let
 me
 see
 their
 beat
 on
 the
 top


and
 the
 bottom.


Uh,
 wow.
 Pretty
 big
 beat.
 158
 versus


149.
 6%
 EPS
 beat.
 EPS
 is
 up
 50%


year-over-year.
 Revenue
 3.19
 versus


3.04.
 Revenues
 beat
 by
 5%.
 Revenues
 up


almost
 30%,
 28%
 year-over-year.


Shout
 out
 to
 T
 Dot
 giving
 us
 some


earnings
 momentum.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Up
 9%.


The
 stock
 was
 already
 up
 225.
 I
 feel


like
 we
 never
 talk
 about
 Celestica.


220%
 year
 to
 date.
 Has
 can
 Tanner
 even


kind
 of
 talked
 about
 Celestica?
 I
 feel


like
 he
 has
 to.
 It's
 a
 Canadian
 company.


But
 there
 you
 go.
 That's
 up
 9%.
 Oaklo,


by
 the
 way,
 end
 of
 the
 day
 up
 about
 1%.


Open
 Door
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 after
 hours.


Big
 Bear
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 to
 end
 out
 the


day.
 Bit
 Farms
 as
 well.
 NXPI,
 that's


flat.
 Well
 Tower,
 that's
 flat.


Celestica's
 up
 eight.
 SMCI
 is
 up
 three.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 there's
 a
 headline
 on


SMCI.
 It
 feels
 like
 there's
 a
 headline


for
 this
 to
 be
 moving
 the
 way
 it
 is.


Or
 there
 might
 be
 a
 recovery.
 SMCI.


No,
 guys.
 I
 don't
 see
 a
 I
 don't
 see
 any


headline.


I
 don't
 see
 anything.


This
 is
 after
 hours
 sort
 of
 like
 traders


alos
 coming
 in.
 I
 see
 nothing.


Uh,
 I
 see
 nothing.
 Yeah,
 Sam
 says,
 "I


don't
 see
 SMCI
 headlines
 as
 well."
 So,


I
 don't
 think
 we
 even
 see
 that.
 Um,


someone
 said,
 uh,
 Bed
 Bath
 and
 Beyond


has
 earnings
 today.
 Do
 they?
 Do
 they


have
 earnings?
 Bed
 Bath
 and
 Beyond?
 If


they
 do,
 they're
 up
 6%
 after
 hours.


I
 thought
 I
 didn't
 even
 know
 these
 guys


were
 still
 a
 public
 company,
 to
 be


honest.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 get
 their


numbers.
 Bed
 B.
 Wasn't
 this
 in
 a
 Wasn't


this
 a
 meme
 stock
 a
 while
 ago?


This
 definitely
 was
 a
 meme
 stock
 or
 it


definitely
 had
 a
 squeeze.
 Hold
 on.
 Let's


look
 at
 the
 chart.


Uh
 five
 years


2024
 went
 from
 16
 to
 34.


Oh
 yeah,
 it
 did.
 2020
 was
 at
 $2.
 It
 went


to
 128.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 This
 2021
 2
 to


128.
 Dude,
 this
 is
 why
 when
 people
 say


we're
 in
 2021,
 I'm
 like,
 okay,
 but
 what


stock
 is
 going
 from
 two
 to
 128?


Like
 maybe
 there's
 some
 examples
 that


are
 kind
 of
 egregious,
 but
 is
 anything


that
 egregious?


I
 don't
 know.
 Bed
 Bath
 and
 Beyond,


that's
 up
 5%.
 Um,
 it
 looks
 like
 they


beat
 EPS
 by
 5
 cents.
 Revenue
 missed
 by
 3


million.
 Nmp
 improvements
 in
 their


adjusted
 IBIDA.
 Operating
 cash
 flow


year-over-year
 is
 up.
 They
 missed


slightly
 on
 revenue
 and
 then
 EPS


came
 just
 in
 line
 with
 expectations.


That's
 not
 too
 bad.
 I
 mean,
 you
 can


understand
 it.
 The
 gross
 margin
 is
 up


420
 basis
 points
 at
 25.3%.


Uh
 CEO
 says
 the
 third
 quarter
 marks


substantial
 progress
 towards
 achieving


profitability,
 outstanding
 metric


performance
 as
 well
 as
 material
 progress


at
 both
 TZ
 and
 Grain
 Chain,
 two


important
 platforms,
 driving
 our


long-term
 goal
 of
 becoming
 the


everything
 home
 company.
 And


you
 have
 basically
 a
 miss
 on
 the
 top
 and


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 beat
 on
 the
 bottom
 or


bad
 bath
 and
 beyond.
 There
 you
 go.


SMCI
 213,000
 call
 buyer
 weekly
 contract.


Someone
 knows
 something.
 Okay.
 So,
 if


someone's
 putting
 in
 200
 grand
 into
 SMCI


for
 a
 weekly
 contract,
 I
 I
 I
 would
 also


agree
 someone
 probably
 knows
 something.


The
 question
 is
 what
 do
 they
 know?
 We


already
 got
 those
 preliminary
 results
 by


SMCI.
 Again,
 there
 was
 those
 rumors
 of
 a


XAI
 contract
 that
 never
 fully


materialized
 last
 week.
 That's
 the


initial
 reason
 it
 pumped
 all
 the
 way
 to


58.
 There
 a
 $58
 call.
 By
 the
 way,
 that's


the
 213


that's
 going
 into
 SMCI
 on
 the
 strike.


Maybe
 it's
 gambling.
 Maybe
 it
 is


gambling.
 Who
 knows?
 By
 the
 way,
 Nancy


Pelosi
 sold
 some
 of
 her
 Apple
 today,
 but


she
 didn't
 really
 sell.
 She
 kind
 of
 like


gifted
 it
 to
 some
 university
 or


something.
 She
 still
 owns
 like
 $30


million
 worth
 of
 Apple,
 but
 she
 sold


like
 250,000
 of
 it
 today.


So,
 if
 you're
 seeing
 a
 headline
 saying


that
 she
 sold,
 she
 kind
 of
 did,
 but
 she


also
 didn't
 necessarily
 sell
 in
 that


way.
 Uh,
 speaking
 of
 politicians,
 here's


an
 update
 as
 well.
 Dan
 New
 House
 bought


AMD
 on
 August
 17th,
 his
 first
 ever
 buy


of
 AMD.
 He
 serves
 on
 the
 House


Appropriation
 Subcommittee
 on
 Energy.


Today,
 the
 Department
 of
 Energy


announced
 a
 $1
 billion
 partnership
 with


AMD
 to
 build
 two
 supercomputers.


So
 again,
 we're
 not
 saying
 he
 knew
 that


the
 Department
 of
 Energy
 would
 give
 AMD


a
 billion
 dollar
 partnership
 even
 if
 he


serves
 on
 the
 House
 Appropriations
 of


Subcommittee
 on
 Energy.
 We're
 just


saying
 he's
 a
 phenomenal
 stock
 picker.


And
 you
 know
 that
 that
 is
 the


implication
 from
 when
 you
 see
 this
 type


of
 stuff.
 So
 shout
 out
 to
 Mr.
 Dan
 New


House
 for
 knowing
 his
 [ __ ]
 when
 it
 comes


to
 picking
 stocks.
 AMD
 reaching
 that


all-time
 high
 at
 260
 today,
 25975
 after


hours.
 Nvidia
 still
 191,
 Tesla
 452,


Pounder
 18872.


Sam
 says
 he
 did
 due
 diligence
 for
 years.


Of
 course,
 bro.
 He's
 been
 studying
 Lisa


Sue's
 philosophy
 and
 inference
 training


for
 years.


Being
 on
 the
 subcommittee
 for
 energy


means
 nothing.
 Means
 absolutely
 nothing.


So,
 there
 you
 go.
 Uh,
 Confluent,
 we


didn't
 get
 their
 results
 yet.
 Trying
 to


see
 this
 one.
 CLS
 still
 moving.


Confluent.
 Okay.

 I
 think
 that's

growth
 in
 Confluent

43%

 and


acceleration
 for
 remaining
 performance


obligations
 we're
 also
 seeing


accelerating

 of
 DSP
 components


of
 our
 platform
 said
 the
 CEO
 uh
 cloud


revenue
 was
 161
 million
 up
 24%


year-over-year.
 Our
 strong
 third
 quarter


performance
 highlights
 the
 momentum
 of


our
 data
 streaming
 platform
 and
 our


diversified
 growth
 strategy.


Uh
 our
 robust
 topline
 growth
 stabilized


dollarbased
 net
 retention
 rate
 and


continued
 margin
 expansion
 are
 testament


to
 our
 ability
 to
 drive
 durable


profitable
 growth
 over
 the
 long
 term.


Looks
 like
 the
 street
 is
 liking
 these


numbers
 as
 well.


There
 you
 go.


He
 just
 watches
 Jose.
 Exactly.
 You
 just


watch
 this,
 Jose.


All
 right.
 So,
 I
 it
 looks
 like
 that's


what
 you
 have
 on
 earnings.
 I
 mean,
 it's


a
 relatively
 boring
 earnings.
 I
 mean,
 in


terms
 of
 the
 the
 uh
 the
 volatility.


Amcor
 basically
 flat.
 It
 was
 at
 33:15
 in


the
 morning.
 It's
 at
 3302.
 CLS,
 that's


one
 that
 has
 actually
 making
 a
 move.


Looks
 like
 they
 had
 a
 pretty
 good
 beat


on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 And
 I
 really


have
 not
 heard
 much
 about
 this
 company.


And
 the
 fact
 that
 they're
 a
 Canadian


company
 is
 even
 more
 impressive.
 So
 this


one
 now
 up
 almost
 250%
 year
 to
 date.


Cadence
 flat
 after
 hours.
 NXPI
 up
 a


little
 bit.
 Confluent
 up
 5%
 and
 then


Whirlpool
 guidance
 was
 low
 but
 top
 and


the
 bottom
 beats
 were
 good.
 That
 stock


also
 flat.
 So
 really
 the
 story
 of
 after


hours
 is
 Celestea


making
 that
 15%
 move.


Uh
 Waste
 Management's
 not
 going
 to


happen
 for
 a
 while.
 They
 usually
 do
 it


at
 like
 6
 PM.
 So,
 Waste
 Management,
 we


might
 see
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 later,
 but


their
 earnings
 tend
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 after


the
 uh
 the
 bell.
 S&P
 still
 moving
 after


hours.
 My
 goodness.
 685


72.
 SoFi
 moving
 after
 hours
 as
 well.


3022.


Um


and
 the
 NASDAQ
 moving
 after
 hours.
 I


mean,
 we're
 still


we're
 still
 moving,
 which
 is
 not
 too


bad.
 Yeah.
 dull
 day
 of
 earnings
 after


the
 uh
 after
 the
 exciting
 move
 on
 the


indices,
 but
 maybe
 that's
 okay.
 Maybe
 a


lot
 of
 those
 names
 kind
 of
 just
 needed


to
 consolidate,
 which
 you
 could
 argue
 is


relatively
 healthy
 as
 well.


So,


there
 you
 go.


All right,
 that's
 what
 we
 got.


That
 is
 what
 we
 got.
 Steve
 said
 he'll
 be


on
 in
 five
 minutes
 and
 then
 uh
 we'll


talk
 to
 Steve.
 We'll
 get
 some
 of
 his


thoughts
 on
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the


markets.
 Obviously,
 we
 got
 SoFi
 coming


tomorrow,
 so
 we'll
 talk
 about
 that.


Who's
 excited
 for
 SoFi?
 Oh,
 hold
 on.
 We


got
 to
 do
 SoFi,
 pump
 or
 dump.
 We
 haven't


even
 done
 that
 yet.
 I
 should
 have
 done


that
 in
 the
 morning.
 I
 forgot.


I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 90%
 of
 you
 say


pump
 on
 SoFi.
 I
 think
 everyone
 is
 bowled


up
 for
 SoFi.
 And
 I
 know
 everyone
 is


thinking
 one
 direction,
 it
 goes
 the


opposite,
 but
 I
 kind
 of
 think
 I
 kind
 of


think
 the
 crowd
 is
 going
 to
 be
 right
 on


this
 one.
 SoFi,
 pump
 or
 dump.


What
 do
 we
 think,
 folks?


What
 do
 we
 think
 for
 so
 far?


What
 do
 we
 think?
 Do
 we
 have
 any
 other


headlines
 today?
 We
 talked
 about
 Amazon,


talked
 about
 the
 Tesla
 call
 options,
 uh


talked
 about
 some
 of
 the
 politician


moves.
 Oh,
 Robin
 Hood
 brought
 closedend


funds
 to
 the
 platform.
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


honest,
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 much
 about


closed-end
 funds.
 Uh
 but
 you
 can
 now


invest
 in
 400
 of
 them.
 I
 have
 to
 do
 more


research
 on
 what
 exactly
 a
 CF
 is,
 but


Robin's
 bringing
 them
 to
 the
 platform.


If
 you
 are
 someone
 who
 invests
 in


closed-end
 funds,
 then
 you've,
 you
 know,


been
 waiting
 for
 this.
 A
 lot
 of
 people


are
 waiting
 for
 bonds
 and
 mutual
 and


index
 funds
 to
 come
 to
 Robin
 Hood.
 But,


uh,
 closed
 end
 funds
 are
 here


and
 that
 could
 also
 be
 something


exciting
 for
 Hoodie.
 Outside
 of
 that,
 we


talked
 about
 the
 Hood
 upgrade
 in
 the


morning,
 got
 to
 161.
 Uh,


yeah,
 nothing
 else
 too
 crazy.
 Oh,
 take
 a


look
 at
 this
 chart
 right
 here.
 This
 this


I
 thought
 was
 pretty
 cool.
 October
 28th


is
 the
 most
 bullish
 day
 of
 the
 year.


On
 average,
 the
 S&P
 500
 since
 1950
 has


been
 up
 half
 a
 percent.
 The
 S&P
 500
 was


up
 1.12%


today.
 If
 we
 go
 up
 another
 half
 a


percent,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 be
 inching


towards
 7,000
 if
 the
 historical
 trend
 of


October
 28th
 actually
 uh
 stays
 intact.


Oh,
 that
 would
 be
 great
 for
 SoFi.
 That


is
 correct.
 That
 would
 be
 great
 for


SoFi.


So
 there
 you
 go.
 Should
 be
 fun.
 Tess


says
 triple
 beat
 then
 dump.
 I
 I
 feel


like
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 are
 getting
 prepared


for
 that
 mentally
 to
 deal
 with
 it.
 But
 I


also
 feel
 like
 everyone's
 thinking
 this


is
 the
 quarter
 where
 SoFi
 rerates.
 You


know,
 you
 always
 have
 that
 one
 quarter


where
 SoFi
 re
 or
 when
 when
 any
 company


goes
 through
 a
 transformation.


Um
 78%
 of
 you
 say
 pump
 versus
 dump.


All
 right,
 we're
 gonna
 see
 tomorrow.


Yes,
 I
 bought
 a thousand
 shares
 of
 SoFi.


Average
 is
 29.


I'm
 riding
 with
 you
 guys.
 I'm
 riding


with
 it.
 We're
 going
 to
 see.


I
 feel
 like
 it's
 not
 crazy
 for
 it
 to
 gap


up
 to
 35.
 I
 really
 don't
 given
 how
 the


banks
 have
 crushed.
 But
 if
 it
 goes
 to


25,
 I
 don't
 think
 anyone's
 going
 to
 be


too
 too
 surprised.
 I
 mean,
 it
 happens


with
 SoFi,
 but
 as
 long
 as
 the
 company


executes,
 that's
 what
 probably
 matters


the
 most.
 And
 look,
 if
 it
 actually
 does


have
 a
 dump
 after
 good
 earnings,
 I'll


buy
 more.
 I'll
 DCA.


It
 is
 okay
 to
 DCA
 into
 a
 quality


company.
 We
 just
 got
 to
 see
 how
 these


earnings
 look
 like.
 Fed
 cuts
 will
 be
 on


Wednesday.
 We're
 just
 assuming
 the
 Fed


cuts
 are
 on
 Wednesday.
 The
 FOMC
 meeting


will
 be
 on
 Wednesday.
 Hopefully,
 we
 get


a
 cut.
 We
 are
 like,
 imagine
 we
 don't
 get


a
 cut,
 bro.
 We
 like
 it's
 the
 market


would
 lose
 their
 mind
 if
 we
 don't
 get
 a


rate
 cut.
 Trump
 would
 lose
 his
 mind
 even


worse
 in
 the
 market.
 But
 yes,
 we're


probably
 we're
 probably
 going
 to
 get
 a


cut.


Tanner
 is
 smart.
 I
 trust
 his
 math.
 You


know
 what?
 That's
 my
 investment
 thesis


as
 well,
 to
 be
 honest.
 Tanner
 is
 smart


and
 I
 trust
 his
 math.
 I
 uh
 I
 agree
 with


that.
 That
 that's
 that's
 one
 of
 the


easier
 ways
 I've
 been
 able
 to
 invest
 in


SoFi.
 Just
 Tanner
 is
 smart.
 Uh
 let's
 get


a
 little
 bit
 of
 coverage
 right
 here
 on


Apple
 as
 we
 get
 into
 those
 earnings
 and


then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> Everyone's
 getting
 bullish
 on
 the
 stock.


uh
 JP
 Morgan
 this
 morning
 uh
 piling
 on


to
 all
 those
 analyst
 commentary
 that
 we


heard
 last
 week
 saying
 they're
 expecting


um
 an
 um
 a
 robust
 high
 singledigit


revenue
 growth
 not
 just
 for
 the


September
 quarter
 they're
 going
 to


report
 on
 Thursday
 but
 also
 in
 the


guidance
 for
 the
 December
 quarter


obviously
 the
 biggest
 one
 all
 on
 the


back
 of
 that
 iPhone
 17
 momentum
 we
 keep


hearing
 about
 that
 this
 is
 a
 very
 strong


iPhone
 cycle
 so
 we'll
 be
 getting
 some


real
 clarity
 from
 Apple
 just
 in
 a
 couple


days
 time
 Scott
 Yeah,
 we'll
 continue
 to


watch
 that,
 Steve.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much,


Courtney.
 Everybody


>> streets
 bullish
 on
 Apple.
 They've
 been


upgrading
 it.
 S&P
 still
 moving
 after


hours,
 guys.
 We're
 at
 an
 all-time
 high


after
 hours.
 Apple
 26870.


26870.


All right.
 There
 you
 go.
 There
 you
 go.


That's
 what
 uh
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 on
 the


day.
 All right.
 So,
 when
 Steve
 comes
 on,


we'll
 talk
 some
 SoFi.
 We'll
 talk
 some
 of


his
 market
 commentary.
 He
 also
 said
 he


had
 something
 to
 say.
 I
 don't
 know
 what


he
 has
 to
 say,
 but
 he
 was
 like,
 I
 need


to
 say
 something.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know what


he's
 going
 to
 say,
 but
 we'll
 see
 what
 he


says.
 Um,
 and
 then
 after
 Steve,
 we
 will


do
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 fun
 birthday
 stuff.


We'll
 do
 a
 giveaway
 and
 uh


then
 we'll
 go
 through
 some
 of
 the
 old


pictures
 that
 I
 said
 I
 was
 going
 to
 show


you
 guys
 from
 my
 past.
 We'll
 do
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 walk
 down
 memory
 lane
 giveaway


at
 the
 same
 time.
 And
 so
 we'll
 go


through
 all
 that
 and
 I'll
 get
 to
 the


super
 chats


as
 well,
 but
 it
 seems
 like
 that's
 pretty


much
 what
 we
 got.


Seems
 like
 that's
 pretty
 much
 what
 we


got.
 The
 the
 name
 of
 the
 cart
 book


that's
 coming
 out
 is
 The
 Philosopher
 in


the
 Valley.
 If
 you
 order,
 if
 you
 go
 to


Amazon,
 type
 in
 The
 Philosopher
 in
 the


Valley,
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 the
 u
 the


pre-orders


link.
 The
 Philosopher
 in
 the
 Valley
 is


the
 name
 of
 the
 of
 the
 book.


Um,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 about
 the
 Amazon


layoff?
 Someone
 said
 on
 CBC
 it's
 a


yellow
 flag
 right
 before
 earnings.
 You


know,
 let's
 get
 a
 little bit
 more


coverage
 on
 that.
 I'm
 not
 fully
 sure


what
 to
 make
 of
 it.
 It
 It
 was
 a
 bit


weird
 for
 them
 to
 do
 30,000
 right
 before


the
 quarter.
 It's
 almost
 them
 saying,


"Hey,
 the
 quarter
 is
 going
 to
 suck,
 but


look,
 we
 cut
 30,000
 jobs,
 so
 don't
 get


mad
 at
 us
 if
 the
 uh
 if
 the
 earnings


aren't
 the
 best,
 which,
 you
 know,
 that


is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 yellow
 flag,
 but


maybe
 the
 earnings
 are
 good
 and
 they


want
 to
 make
 the
 earnings
 even
 better
 by


saying
 we're
 going
 to
 save
 a
 bunch
 of


money."
 So,
 we
 got
 to
 kind
 of
 see
 how
 it


plays
 out.
 In
 the
 long
 run,
 I
 do
 think


that
 Wall
 Street
 will
 cheer
 for


efficiency
 driven
 by
 AI
 that
 we
 will


undoubtedly
 see
 not
 just
 at
 the
 MAG7


companies,
 but
 across
 every
 company
 in


America,
 but
 in
 the
 short
 term,
 I
 think


there's
 a
 different
 question,
 which
 is


hearing
 about
 layoffs
 this
 close
 to


earnings
 for
 me
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


yellow
 flag
 because
 politically
 it's


hard
 to
 talk
 about
 doing
 layoffs
 and


then
 have
 a
 monster
 earnings
 quarter.


you
 know,
 it's
 easier
 to
 kind
 of
 get


past
 that
 quarter
 and
 then
 maybe
 do
 it


in
 a
 few
 weeks.
 Now,
 maybe
 this
 news


wasn't
 intended
 to
 get
 out
 right
 now.


Obviously,
 it
 had
 been
 rumored
 for
 a
 few


weeks,
 but
 that's
 something
 that
 I'm


thinking
 about
 just
 in
 the
 immediate


term
 is
 does
 this
 sort
 of
 point
 to
 maybe


a
 rougher
 quarter
 for
 Amazon
 here
 in
 a


couple
 of
 days.


>> Yeah,
 Dan,
 you
 you
 you
 want
 to
 push
 back


on
 this
 this
 whole
 notion
 of
 of
 AI


displacing
 jobs?


>> Well,
 is
 is
 that
 what
 I
 hear
 what
 I


heard
 you
 taking
 the
 other
 side
 of?


debate.


>> I
 Alex
 is
 right.
 Like
 obviously
 Alex
 is


usually
 right.
 So
 that's
 a
 safe


assumption.


>> Okay,
 we'll
 go
 back
 to
 that.
 But
 waste


management,
 folks.
 There
 you
 go.
 You
 got


your
 revenue.
 Uh
 looks
 like
 it's
 a
 miss.


Stocks
 down
 5%
 right
 here.
 6.4
 came
 in


at
 6
 point
 or
 6.531.
 It
 came
 in
 at
 6.4.


EPS
 198
 versus
 204.


Uh
 it
 got
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 miss
 on
 waste


management.


This
 stock
 has


it's
 not
 really
 been
 doing
 the
 best
 this


year.
 It's
 up
 six%.
 It's
 not
 supposed
 to


move
 like
 crazy.
 You
 know,
 it
 pays
 a


consistent
 dividend,
 but
 uh
 every


opportunity
 it's
 had
 to
 really
 break


out.
 It's
 it's
 just
 not
 delivered
 the


best
 earnings.
 This
 is
 very
 similar
 to


the
 miss
 they
 had
 last
 quarter.
 So,
 you


got
 a
 double
 miss
 on
 waste
 management.
 I


I
 don't
 think
 there's
 a
 demand
 problem


for
 picking
 up
 trash.
 I
 think
 this
 might


be
 more
 operational
 efficiencies
 inside


of
 the
 company
 that
 led
 to
 these
 bad


margins


and
 that's
 why
 you're
 getting
 some
 pain


right
 there.
 So
 there
 you
 go.
 Waste


management.
 That
 one
 is
 slightly
 down.


Um
 I
 am
 glowing
 right
 here
 on
 the


screen.
 So
 you
 know
 we
 we
 we
 switched
 up


the
 studio
 a
 little
 bit.
 I
 pushed


everything
 up
 in
 order
 to
 like
 scale
 out


the
 background.


I
 didn't
 realize
 that
 the
 sun
 would
 be


shining
 right
 on
 my
 face
 when
 I
 did


that.
 So
 I'm
 gonna
 have
 to
 figure
 that


out
 tomorrow.
 But


there
 you
 go.
 Your
 boy
 is
 uh


it's
 not
 a
 birthday
 blunt.
 That's
 not


what's
 happening.
 I
 there's
 like
 the


windows
 are
 closed,
 but
 it's
 still


there's
 still
 a
 little
 peak
 where
 the


sun
 is
 like
 coming
 through,
 you
 know,
 in


a
 couple
 months,
 not
 even
 a
 couple


months,
 in
 a
 couple
 weeks,
 we're
 not


going to
 worry
 about
 this
 because
 it'll


get
 dark
 by
 4
 p.m.
 in
 New
 Jersey,
 so
 the


sun
 will
 be
 gone,
 but
 it's
 still
 not


fully
 winter
 yet.
 So,
 there
 you
 go.
 Yes,


it's
 heaven
 light.
 It's
 It's
 heaven


light
 that
 we
 got.
 Steve,
 what's
 up?


>> Happy
 birthday.


>> Thank
 you.
 I
 appreciate
 it.
 means
 a
 lot.


>> I
 figured
 what
 could
 I
 get
 a
 minute
 that


he
 doesn't
 already
 have
 except
 me


driving
 through
 the
 city
 on
 the
 market


close.


>> You
 know,
 that
 that
 that
 that
 is
 more


than
 I
 could
 ever
 ask
 for
 to
 be
 honest.


Hearing
 uh
 hearing
 the
 road
 rage
 is,
 you


know,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 what
 we
 we
 listen


to
 the
 market
 close
 for.
 So,


>> it
 came
 out
 before
 when
 a
 bicyclist
 went


right
 in
 front
 of
 him.


>> Did
 Did
 you
 honk?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 may
 have


Dude,
 you're
 you're
 in
 New
 York.


Thickening
 thickening
 through.
 You
 were


in
 New
 York.


>> Yeah.
 This
 is
 what
 happens.


>> All right.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 you
 did
 say
 you


had
 something
 to
 say.
 Did
 Were
 you


trolling
 or
 did
 you
 actually
 have


something
 to
 say?


>> No,
 you
 know,
 we
 um


you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 blame
 somebody


else
 other
 than
 me
 for
 what's
 about
 to


happen.


>> Okay.
 What's
 about
 to
 happen?


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 one
 of
 your
 friends
 from


Miami
 reached
 out
 to
 mine.


>> Okay.
 and
 and
 gave
 me
 an
 idea


and
 I
 may
 or
 may
 not
 have
 uh
 you
 know


reached
 out
 to
 a
 couple
 people.


>> So,
 you
 just
 got
 to
 wait
 and
 see.


>> Like
 a
 stock
 idea.


>> Something
 will
 be
 happening.


>> Are
 you
 talking
 about
 a
 stock
 or
 you're


talking
 about
 an
 actual
 product
 that


you're
 buying?


>> No,
 I
 don't
 know.
 We're
 gonna
 have
 to


see
 what
 happens.


>> This
 is
 the
 most
 vague
 thing
 you
 could


have
 possibly
 came
 up
 to
 say.


We're
 gonna
 have
 to
 see
 what
 happens
 in


the
 next
 couple
 of
 minutes.


>> Okay,
 we
 have
 someone
 backstage.
 I
 guess


this
 is
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 this
 is
 part
 of


what
 uh
 what
 Mr.
 Steve
 is
 saying,
 but


Tanner,
 what's
 up,
 man?


>> May
 or
 may
 not
 be
 a
 part
 of
 what
 Steve


is
 saying.


Thanks
 for
 having
 me.
 Happy
 birthday,


Emit.


>> Thank
 you.
 I
 appreciate
 I
 had
 to
 hold
 my


uh
 I
 had
 to
 hold
 my
 tongue
 in
 chat
 and


not
 uh
 try
 to
 hold
 off
 a
 second.
 But


yeah,
 happy
 birthday,
 brother.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Couple
 a
 couple
 of
 us
 figured
 that
 we


would
 get
 together
 and
 say
 happy


birthday
 to
 you
 for
 a
 few
 minutes
 on


your
 stream
 live.


>> A
 Okay,
 that
 that
 I
 appreciate
 that.


That
 is
 this
 an
 intervention.


>> It
 is
 not.


>> Yeah,
 bro.
 You
 made
 it
 so
 like


mysterious.
 It's
 like
 no,
 you
 could
 have


just
 said,
 "Hey,
 we're
 coming
 on
 the


street."


That's
 all.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 we
 didn't
 want
 you
 to
 know.


>> Well,
 it
 seems
 like
 I'm
 not
 the
 one.


>> No,
 you're
 not
 the
 late
 one.
 The
 other


two
 are
 late
 and
 one
 of
 them
 gets
 a


pass.
 I
 think
 he's
 on
 a
 plane.


>> Did
 he
 reach
 out
 to
 Derek?


>> Uh,
 it's
 not
 Derek
 that
 reached
 out
 to


me,
 but
 somebody
 else
 with
 a
 D
 reached


out
 to
 me.


>> That
 did
 not
 sound
 right,
 but
 anyway.


>> What
 are
 you
 talking
 about?
 somebody


else
 that's
 first
 name
 starts
 with
 a
 D.


>> No,
 but
 you
 said
 with
 a
 D.
 This
 is


>> I'm
 just
 saying.
 Look,
 Donald
 Trump.


Donnie
 T's
 coming
 on
 the
 stream,
 bro.


>> The
 dentist.
 Is
 it
 my
 dentist?


>> It
 is
 your
 dentist,
 ladies
 and


gentlemen.


>> No.


>> No.


>> Okay.
 Anyway,
 well,
 while
 I
 got
 you
 guys


here,
 first
 of
 all,
 thank
 you
 guys
 for


being
 here.
 Deeply
 appreciate
 it.


Tanner,
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 a


podcast
 at
 9:30
 anyway,
 so
 uh
 we'll
 be


talking.
 Um,
 dude,
 we
 got
 a
 big
 day


tomorrow.
 I
 mean,
 you
 think
 you
 think


we're
 going
 to
 really
 make
 a
 run
 for
 it?


Is
 tomorrow
 the
 day
 SoFi
 gets
 rerated?


>> Uh,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 an
 exciting
 day,
 I


think.
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 how
 much
 of


this
 is
 sort
 of
 pulled
 forward
 a
 little


bit.
 Um,
 $30
 going
 into
 earnings.
 I


mean,
 we've
 never
 seen
 this
 before,
 ever


in
 history.
 Uh
 that
 said,
 if
 we
 get
 a


million
 new
 members,


um
 I
 think
 uh
 this
 the
 stock's
 going
 to


head
 higher.
 I'm
 pretty
 excited.


And
 you're
 excited.
 I
 mean,
 you
 actually


bought
 into
 this
 company.


>> I
 did.
 I
 kind
 of
 had
 to,
 bro,
 because
 if


this
 thing
 runs
 and
 everyone
 else
 is


having
 fun,
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 bored
 on
 the


sidelines.
 So
 said,
 you
 know what?
 I'd


rather
 bag
 hold
 than
 miss
 out
 on
 the


fun.
 I
 also
 do
 fundamentally
 think
 like


they
 should
 be
 setting
 up
 for
 a
 good


quarter
 especially
 with
 rate
 cuts


coming.
 So


>> admit
 uh
 you
 know
 reached
 out
 and
 he


said
 uh
 Tanner
 should
 I
 buy
 this?
 It
 was


like
 around
 26
 bucks
 or
 something.
 He


goes
 should
 I
 buy
 this
 company?
 And
 I


was
 like
 well
 if
 you
 don't
 care
 about
 it


like
 probably
 not
 like
 we
 never
 know


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 on
 earnings.
 So


like
 you
 know
 buy
 something
 that
 you're


actually
 convinced
 on.
 Then
 he
 said
 okay


I'll
 buy
 a
 thousand
 shares
 and
 then
 that


was
 it.


So


>> you're
 our
 quant,
 bro.
 You're
 our
 quant.


>> I
 did
 not
 tell
 him
 to
 buy.
 This
 was
 his


purchase.
 So
 it
 cannot
 go


>> on
 me.
 This
 is
 100%
 you.


>> She's
 saying
 blessed
 by
 a
 mit.
 It's


great.


>> It's
 it's it's
 100%
 Tanner.
 It
 is
 not


me.
 So
 we're
 Tanner.
 We're
 going
 to
 see


tomorrow
 how
 this
 Look,
 here's
 the


thing.
 You
 get
 all
 the
 pressure
 because


you're
 the
 SoFi
 guy.
 So
 if
 it
 goes
 to


the
 moon,
 you
 get
 all
 the
 love.
 And
 if


it
 goes
 down,
 you
 get
 all
 the
 hate.
 Now,


none
 of
 the
 hate
 is
 justified
 because


this
 stock
 is
 up
 112%
 this
 year.
 And


even
 if
 it's
 up
 80%
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


year,
 who
 the
 hell
 cares?
 But
 that's


part
 of
 being
 the
 guy,
 right?
 So,


>> well,
 you
 know
 what?
 I
 don't
 know
 if


there's
 many
 companies
 that
 you
 put
 your


money
 on
 that
 uh
 that
 go
 down
 on


earnings.
 So,
 it's
 actually
 pretty


exciting
 for
 me
 that
 you're
 a
 part
 of
 it


because
 then
 it
 almost
 like
 uh
 you
 know,


it's
 confirmation
 bias
 for
 me.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 your
 videos
 are
 confirmation


bias
 for
 me.
 So,
 it's
 just
 we're
 circle


jerking
 the
 confirmation.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Cheers.
 Cheers.


>> There
 you
 go.
 Um,
 Steve,
 I
 I
 heard
 on


the
 SoFi
 Weekly
 you
 were
 a
 little
 bit


more
 bearish
 than
 bullish.
 So,
 do do
 you


think
 tomorrow
 can
 really
 be
 a
 good


quarter?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 can
 it
 be
 a
 good


quarter?
 Yes.
 Um,
 is
 it
 going
 to
 45


anytime
 soon?
 I
 am
 still
 skeptical,
 but


if
 they
 blow
 out
 a
 million
 members


tomorrow,
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 that's
 going


to
 change
 my
 opinion
 pretty
 quickly.
 And


when
 they
 did
 the
 dilution,
 Tanner
 and
 I


were
 pretty
 bullish
 about
 it,
 even


though
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 on
 X
 weren't.


So,
 I
 do
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 the


ability
 to
 put
 up
 a
 good
 quarter.
 And


I'm
 very
 interested
 in
 what
 the


commentary
 is
 around
 rate
 cuts
 and
 what


they're
 seeing
 in
 the
 housing
 market.


So,
 we'll
 see
 what
 happens.


Yeah.
 Like
 what
 do
 you
 think
 of
 it?


Not
 only
 on
 earnings
 could
 we
 see
 a
 pop,


but
 then
 the
 day
 after
 there's
 a
 high


chance
 that
 we
 see
 a
 rate
 cut


afterwards.


That
 seems
 like
 a
 pretty
 decent
 setup


for
 SoFi
 stock.
 I
 mean,
 how
 could
 it
 not


be?


>> Well,
 that's
 another
 reason
 I
 bought.


I'm
 like,
 okay,
 so
 rates
 are
 coming
 down


and
 you've
 got
 a
 quarter
 where
 I
 think


notto
 I
 mean,
 even
 the
 way
 that
 he's


tweeting,
 the
 way
 that
 he's
 kind
 of


publicly
 talking
 about
 it,
 seems
 pretty


bullish
 about.
 So
 those
 were
 two


catalysts
 that's
 hard
 to
 ignore.
 And
 and


then
 second
 of
 all,
 it's
 like
 all
 the


banks
 have
 crushed.
 So
 why
 would
 I
 fade


another
 bank
 that's
 growing
 way
 faster


than
 the
 other
 banks
 um
 that
 has
 a
 lot


more
 growth
 baked
 into
 it
 that
 just


released
 level
 one
 options
 and
 crypto
 or


cryptos
 coming
 down
 the
 pipeline.
 So
 I


just
 think
 there's
 more
 tailwinds
 than


headwinds
 and
 that's
 why
 I
 wouldn't
 be


too


like
 scared
 to
 take
 a
 bet
 even
 at


basically
 all-time
 highs
 for
 So


yeah,
 all
 the
 banks
 ended
 up
 putting
 up


good
 earnings.
 Lending
 Club
 essentially


uh
 an
 identical
 business
 model
 to
 to


SoFi.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 up
 like
 11%
 on
 the


day.


>> Like
 everything
 is
 lining
 up
 for
 them
 to


have
 a
 smash
 earnings.
 It's
 just
 we'll


we'll
 find
 out
 tomorrow
 morning
 what


actually
 happened
 and
 if
 we
 were


correct.


>> Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.


>> It'll
 be
 interesting
 to
 see
 Dotto
 on


CNBC.


>> Yes,
 we
 will
 likely
 also
 see
 that
 as


well.


Um,


all right.
 I
 see
 someone
 else
 backstage


that
 you
 guys.
 So,
 you
 we
 we
 we
 just


decided
 to
 make
 it
 a
 party,
 didn't
 we?


We
 just
 decided
 to
 make
 it
 a
 party.
 Roy,


what's
 up,
 man?


>> Sorry,
 I
 have
 no
 sound.
 Give
 me
 just
 a


minute.


>> Hey,
 good
 job,
 Roy,
 keeping
 up
 with
 the


message.
 Uh,
 string.


>> Oh,
 I'm
 here.
 There
 was
 a
 couple
 tropes


every
 episode


>> five
 minutes
 earlier.


>> Roy
 stream
 is
 always
 messed
 up.
 Emit's


always
 blaming
 Streamyard
 for
 his
 laggy


internet.


>> Matt's
 in
 the
 background,
 but
 the
 screen


is
 black.
 So,
 okay,
 there
 is
 there
 Matt


is
 thing.
 Yeah,
 his
 screen
 is
 black,
 so


I'm
 not
 going to
 bring
 him
 up
 yet.


All right.
 Well,
 we
 got
 the
 gang
 on


town.
 We
 got
 the
 gang
 in
 town.


>> Happy
 birthday,
 Marco.


>> Thank
 you,
 Roy.
 I
 appreciate
 it,
 man.
 It


means
 a
 lot.
 Means
 a
 ton.


28.
 How
 are
 you
 uh
 celebrating?


>> I'm
 uh


analyzing
 the
 global
 capital
 equity


markets
 at
 400
 p.m.
 on
 the
 market
 close


with
 you
 guys.


>> This
 was
 supposed
 to
 happen
 so
 much


faster
 than


>> I
 was
 the
 only
 one
 that
 followed
 what


what
 Steve
 said.
 Um


>> yeah,
 ridiculous.
 I
 I
 sent
 him
 a
 text
 in


this
 thread.
 I'm
 like,
 "All
 right,


timet's
 moved
 up."
 And
 of
 course,
 Matt


said,
 "Yeah."
 And
 he's
 the
 last
 one
 on


and
 he's
 the
 one
 that
 actually
 responded


in
 the
 thread.


>> Okay.
 To
 be
 fair
 though,
 it's
 a
 Monday.


You
 guys,
 you
 know,
 some
 of
 you
 have


jobs.
 Like
 I
 I
 don't
 expect
 anyone
 to


capitulate
 their
 schedule,


>> right?
 But
 we've
 planned
 this
 at
 like
 1


p.m.


>> Exactly.
 So
 that
 that's
 the
 other
 thing


like
 that.
 That's


>> maybe
 even
 earlier


>> though.
 Steve
 like
 sent
 out
 that
 uh
 can


you
 guys
 go
 earlier?
 Basically
 15


minutes
 before
 we
 were
 supposed
 to
 go.


I'm
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 cooking
 getting


stuff
 ready
 for
 dinner.
 So
 I'm
 not
 late.


I'm
 on
 time.
 I'm
 not
 Tanner.
 Tanner
 was


also
 very
 early.
 So
 congratulations


Tann.


>> Tanner's
 not
 captain
 early.


>> It
 means
 you
 guys
 did
 not
 need
 to
 do


those,
 but
 it
 means
 a
 lot.
 I
 appreciate


you
 all
 being
 here.
 Appreciate
 you
 all


celebrating
 with
 me.
 I
 think
 Matt
 is


backstage.


Hey,


we
 got
 him.
 We
 got
 him.


>> Sorry,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 get
 past
 all
 these


god
 firewalls
 and
 god
 knows
 what
 in
 this


fortress
 that
 I'm
 in
 over
 here.


>> No,
 don't do
 do
 not
 apologize
 at
 all,


dude.
 Thank
 you,
 man.


>> Happy
 birthday,
 brother.


>> Thank
 you
 guys.
 Means
 a
 lot.
 Means
 means


a
 lot.


>> Take
 your
 shirt
 off.
 Just
 kidding.


>> I
 tried
 to
 get


>> I
 I
 tried
 to
 get
 someone
 on
 Cameo.
 um
 to


wish
 you
 a
 happy
 birthday,
 but
 there
 was


no
 one
 really
 in
 the
 finance
 space
 or


anyone
 that
 you
 would
 know
 on
 Cameo.
 I


was
 like,
 man,
 can
 Tom
 Lee
 do
 a
 a
 quick


video
 or
 something?
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 get


something
 for
 you,
 but
 I
 couldn't
 find


anything.


>> Um
 but
 yeah,


>> I
 love
 it.
 This
 is
 like
 the
 Spice
 Girls


performing.
 Yes,
 exactly.
 Exactly.


>> Would
 be
 good
 to
 get
 Tom
 Lee
 on.
 That


would
 be
 awesome.


>> I
 love
 that
 you
 guys
 did
 the
 market


close
 when
 I
 couldn't
 make
 it
 on
 Friday.


It
 was
 so
 cool.
 just
 to
 see
 every
 and


like
 you
 know
 because
 people
 they
 want


it
 was
 a
 alltime
 high
 on
 Friday
 everyone


wanted
 you
 know
 a
 little
 bit
 of


community
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 close
 with


other
 and
 then
 that's
 the
 cool
 thing


about
 this
 community
 dude
 I'm
 just
 so


grateful
 for
 the
 fact
 that
 all
 of
 us
 are


here
 I'll
 call
 into
 Tanner
 stream
 he'll


call
 into
 mine
 Steve
 will
 like
 you
 all


of
 us
 just
 collaborate
 with
 each
 other


seamlessly
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 makes


it
 fun
 you
 know
 that's
 what
 really
 makes


this
 whole
 journey
 so
 fun


>> and
 uh


>> yeah
 I
 was
 uh
 I
 was
 I
 was
 absolutely


exhausted
 I
 was
 working
 from
 home
 and
 I


was
 like
 I
 need
 a
 nap.
 I
 had
 a
 big


headache
 and
 then
 I
 w
 I
 looked
 at
 my


phone
 and
 I
 saw
 that
 you
 posted
 that
 you


weren't
 going
 to
 do
 a
 close
 and
 I
 was


like
 I
 can't
 let
 this
 happen.


>> Can't
 let
 the
 people
 down.


>> This
 needs
 to
 happen.
 And
 so
 uh
 powered


through
 it
 and
 glad
 that
 uh
 glad
 that
 we


were
 able
 to
 make
 it
 work
 out
 for


everybody.


>> I
 love
 it.
 Means
 a
 lot.
 Means


absolutely.
 All
 right.
 So
 I'll
 ask
 you


guys
 one
 question
 then
 I'll
 let
 you
 guys


leave.
 again.
 Really
 appreciate
 you
 guys


even
 hopping
 on
 to
 the
 show.
 Um,
 first


of
 all,
 let's
 just
 let's
 just
 do
 a


straight
 up
 market
 question.
 We'll
 go


around
 the
 room.
 Alltime
 highs
 on
 the


S&P
 still
 moving
 after
 hours
 basically


686
 68595.
 Tanner,
 we'll
 start
 with
 you.


Just
 reaction
 to
 the
 Oh,
 there
 you
 go.


686.
 Reaction
 to
 the
 market
 doing
 what


it's
 been
 doing.


I
 think
 uh
 you
 know
 by
 Thursday
 we're


going
 to
 see
 more
 than
 a
 quarter
 of
 the


S&P
 500
 earnings
 be
 updated
 just
 in


those
 five
 names
 Meta,
 Google,
 Amazon,


Apple,
 and
 Microsoft.
 That's
 24.6%
 of


the
 total
 waitings
 of
 the
 S&P
 500.
 So
 if


they
 all
 shine,
 if
 if
 everything
 goes


through
 as
 expected,
 then
 we
 could
 see


an
 explosive
 rally.
 And
 I
 do
 actually


think
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 north
 of


7,000
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 So
 I


remain
 bullish
 and
 um
 yeah,
 all
 my
 chips


are
 on
 the
 table.
 I
 mean,
 I
 can't
 find


any
 cash
 anymore.


Okay.
 Uh
 Steve,
 you
 are
 calling
 7,000
 at


4,800.
 We
 are
 awfully
 close.
 What
 are


you
 thinking
 about
 this
 market?


>> Okay,
 there
 you
 go.


It's
 going
 I
 mean,
 look,
 how
 can
 I


change
 my
 opinion,
 right?
 I
 was
 at
 7,000


the
 beginning
 of
 the
 year.
 I've
 been


7,000
 the
 whole
 time.
 I'm
 not
 revising


it
 down.
 I'm
 not
 revising
 up.
 I'm
 just


sticking
 at
 7,000.


>> Okay,
 Roy,
 your
 thoughts
 on
 rate
 cuts,


earnings,
 and
 the
 market
 hitting
 alltime


highs.


>> I
 mean,
 pretty
 much
 everything
 is
 very


bullish.
 There
 are,
 you
 know,
 some


things
 further
 on
 the
 horizon
 that
 are


not
 necessarily,
 but
 there
 are
 some
 that


are
 sitting
 heavy
 in
 cash
 or
 all
 cash.


Um,
 I'm
 like
 Tanner.
 I
 I
 have
 very


little
 cash
 left.
 Uh,
 probably
 1%
 cash


at
 this
 point
 and
 it's
 probably
 going
 to


be
 deployed
 this
 week.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 we


we're
 the
 roller
 coaster
 is
 still
 in


full
 operation.
 So,
 there
 will
 be
 times


where
 on
 again,
 off
 again
 hits
 with


tariff
 stuff,
 but
 there's
 real


underlying
 momentum
 in
 the
 market.
 Uh,


of
 course
 the
 the
 tariffs
 of
 being


resolved.
 Uh,
 if
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 not


permanent
 yet,
 but
 if
 that's
 actually


the
 case,
 there's
 not
 much
 in
 the
 term


of
 worry
 uh
 to
 prevent
 the
 bull
 market


from
 continuing
 to
 climb
 as
 long
 as


earnings
 are
 good.
 Tander
 said
 it
 best


there.
 Um,
 and
 so
 this
 week
 I
 think


really
 tells
 us
 that
 rate
 cuts
 also
 very


good
 for
 the
 markets
 too.
 So
 it's
 a
 good


time
 to
 be
 invested
 and
 uh
 glad
 that
 all


I
 think
 all
 of
 us
 are
 pretty
 much
 fully


invested.
 So,


>> all
 right.
 I
 love
 it.
 Matt
 money,
 what


do
 you
 think?
 We're
 going
 higher.


>> Yeah,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 believe
 in
 cash.


Um,
 so
 somebody
 said
 cash
 uh
 in
 the


chat.
 I
 agree
 with
 that.
 I
 I
 generally


don't
 don't
 believe
 that
 I'm
 normally


fully
 invested
 and
 every
 paycheck
 that
 I


get,
 I
 I
 generally
 put
 all
 that
 as
 much


as
 I
 can
 feasibly
 into
 the
 into
 the


markets.
 But
 I
 mean,
 I
 do
 feel
 like


we're
 getting
 a
 little
 tired
 here,
 but
 I


don't
 think
 that
 it's
 tired
 enough
 where


we're
 going
 to
 see
 it
 top
 out.
 I
 I
 do


think
 that
 we
 still
 have
 another
 5
 to


10%
 to
 go
 before
 we
 really
 turn
 over.


So,
 I
 feel
 that
 that
 means
 that
 we
 have


another
 uh
 potentially
 uh
 500
 points


potentially
 to
 go
 in
 the
 market.
 So,
 I


can
 see
 us
 getting
 to
 7250


um
 before
 we
 really
 start
 to
 see
 some


sort
 of
 large
 retracement.
 Um
 you
 know,


we
 started
 to
 see
 some
 efficiency
 gains.


You
 just
 saw
 Amazon
 potentially
 announce


30,000
 potential
 layoffs.
 Um,
 actually


just
 like
 10
 15
 minutes
 ago,
 an
 article,


I
 think
 it
 was
 from
 Reuters,
 uh,


released
 about
 potential
 30,000
 people


laid
 off.
 So,
 I
 think
 people
 are
 really


trying
 to
 find
 where
 that
 next
 dollar
 is


coming
 from
 to
 hit
 the
 bottom
 line.
 And,


um,
 you
 know,
 that
 coupled
 with


efficiencies
 gained
 from
 AI,
 uh,
 I
 don't


think
 that
 we're
 done
 here.
 And
 these


companies,
 believe
 it
 or
 not,
 even


though
 everyone's
 thinking
 the
 S&P
 500's


expensive,
 I
 mean,
 Steve
 went
 over
 it
 in


a
 really
 good
 fashion
 yesterday
 on
 his


uh
 big
 tech
 earnings
 kind
 of
 preview,


these
 companies
 are
 growing
 at
 a
 pretty


expansive
 rate.
 And
 um
 when
 you
 look
 at


it
 on
 a
 forward,
 you
 know,
 2026
 2027


basis,
 if
 they
 hit
 the
 numbers,
 they're


actually
 not
 that
 expensive.
 Um
 and
 and


these
 are
 premium
 businesses
 that
 are


going
 to
 continue
 to
 deliver.
 So,
 uh,


but
 that
 being
 said,
 they're
 running
 out


of
 capex.
 So,
 um,
 to
 an
 extent.
 So,


unless
 they
 grow
 massively,
 uh,
 I
 do


think
 that
 you'll
 start
 to
 see
 some


growth
 slowdown.
 But
 before
 we
 do
 that,


I
 think
 we
 have
 another,
 uh,
 5
 10%
 to
 go


easily,
 um,
 before
 we,
 we
 see
 some,
 uh,


retracement.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 when
 you


said
 we
 are
 getting
 a
 little
 tired
 here,


I
 I
 would
 agree,
 but
 it's
 also
 like
 we


just
 had
 that
 3%
 draw
 down.
 So,
 you


know,
 may
 maybe
 that
 was
 like
 peak


tiredness
 and
 markets
 needed
 to
 get
 some


of
 the
 froth
 wiped
 out
 of
 everything.


You
 know,
 SoFi
 got
 to
 stupid
 prices.
 A


lot
 of
 these
 companies
 just
 got
 to
 dumb


prices
 and
 uh
 now
 we're
 getting
 a
 bit
 of


recovery
 and
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 we
 have
 to


go
 back
 to
 alltime
 highs,
 but
 you're


starting
 to
 see
 some
 of
 the
 more
 quality


names
 get
 back
 to
 the
 juice
 they
 were


having
 before.
 And
 if
 they
 can
 follow
 up


with
 good
 earnings,
 you
 know,
 maybe


that's
 what
 really
 can
 keep
 this
 this


rally
 going
 on.


All right,
 cool.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.
 I


appreciate
 it.
 very
 very
 blessed
 to
 have


you
 guys
 as
 friends.
 Really
 means
 a
 lot.


Uh
 Roy,
 I
 see
 that
 right
 there.
 Yeah,


we're
 still
 at
 fear.


>> 37.


>> Yeah,
 that
 that's
 the
 funniest
 saying


about
 this
 market
 right
 now
 is
 does


today
 feel
 like
 fear?
 No.
 There
 there's


a
 lot
 that
 goes
 into
 this,
 but
 yeah.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.


>> Watch
 that
 go
 to
 greed
 pretty
 quickly


when
 you
 get
 a
 rate
 cut
 and
 all
 five
 big


tech
 companies
 all
 slaughter
 earnings.


>> Thanks,
 Amed.
 Thanks
 for
 having
 me,
 man.


>> Wait,
 wait,
 wait.
 You
 guys,
 you're
 not


going
 to
 sing?


>> No.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 I
 I
 was
 going
 to
 sing.
 I


thought
 you
 were
 kicking
 us
 out.
 Our


whole
 plan
 was


>> ready
 to
 sing.
 What
 about
 Steve?
 What's


going
 on?
 Where's
 the
 Where's
 the
 song?


>> There
 is
 none.


>> So,
 you're
 not
 gonna
 sing
 happy


birthday?


>> Absolutely
 not.


>> What
 type
 of
 you
 like
 what
 was
 the
 like


you're
 really
 not
 gonna
 sing
 happy


birthday,
 dude?


>> No,
 because
 there's
 no
 candle
 for
 you
 to


blow
 out.


>> Oh,
 good
 good
 excuse.
 It's
 a
 good


reason.
 It's
 good
 reason.


>> I
 thought
 the
 plan
 was
 to
 sing.
 I
 mean,


>> Matt
 Matt,
 you
 have
 a
 singing
 voice.
 If


you


>> Matt
 does
 have
 a
 No,
 no.
 If
 Matt's
 See,


Matt's
 gonna
 do
 the
 Marilyn
 Monroe
 happy


birthday.
 Okay.
 And
 Matt's
 gonna
 he's


gonna
 have
 to
 make
 me
 leave
 the
 room
 if


he
 does
 because
 I'm
 be
 like,
 well,
 Matt


like,
 you
 know,
 Matt
 be
 a
 little
 too


seductive.


>> Matt
 in
 a
 sundress
 over
 a
 sewer.
 The


trying
 to
 hold
 down
 the
 the
 dress.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Exactly.


>> Oh
 my
 god.


>> Yeah.
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 might
 I
 might
 I


might
 have
 something.
 I
 don't
 know.


We'll
 see.
 I
 don't
 know.


>> All
 right.
 I
 appreciate
 you
 guys.
 Thank


you
 so
 much.
 First
 of
 all,
 best


community
 on
 YouTube.
 Absolute
 best


community.
 Did
 uh
 did
 not
 expect
 you


guys
 to
 do
 this,
 so
 it
 means
 a
 lot
 to


me.
 And
 you
 know,
 I'll
 be
 live
 with


Tanner
 and
 Roy
 in
 a
 couple
 hours
 anyway.


But
 appreciate
 you
 guys.
 Love
 all
 you


guys.
 I'm
 putting
 all
 their
 Twitters
 and


YouTubetubes
 in
 the
 chat
 and
 in
 the


description.
 So,
 please
 make
 sure
 to


check
 them
 out.
 But
 thank
 you
 guys.


Really
 means
 a
 lot.


>> Yeah.
 Thanks,
 brother.


>> Happy
 birthday,
 Matt.


>> Later.


>> Wow,
 those
 guys
 are
 nice,
 dude.
 That
 I


did
 not
 expect
 them
 to
 do
 that.
 I


thought
 Steve
 legit
 wanted
 to
 come
 on


because
 he
 had
 some
 stock
 he
 wanted
 to


talk
 about.


But,
 uh,
 that
 was
 very
 nice.
 That
 was


very,
 very,
 very,
 very
 nice
 of
 all
 of


them.
 I
 mean,
 they
 they
 really
 did
 not


have
 to
 take
 time
 out
 of
 their
 day
 on
 a


freaking
 Monday
 to
 do
 this.


Um,


but
 I
 appreciate
 them.
 See,
 and
 this
 is,


you
 know,
 this
 is
 uh
 this
 is so
 the
 cool


the
 cool
 part
 about
 this
 journey
 is


like,
 you
 know,
 when
 you're
 doing
 it


with
 people
 you
 really
 love
 and
 you're


not
 doing
 it
 with
 them
 because
 of
 money


or
 external
 motivations.
 It's
 just
 like


you
 love
 doing
 it.
 You
 know,
 I've
 never


paid
 Steve
 to
 come
 on
 my
 channel
 for
 the


past
 two
 years,
 even
 though
 he's
 given


such
 valuable
 content.
 So,
 when
 he


starts
 his
 own
 channel,
 you
 know,
 I'm


I'm
 very
 happy
 to
 support
 him
 and
 proud


to
 support
 him,
 but
 I
 think
 you
 guys
 are


as
 well.
 And
 same
 thing
 for
 Tanner.
 Roy


Roy
 started
 a
 year
 ago,
 you
 know.
 So


it's
 like
 I
 think
 all
 of
 us
 just
 want
 to


support
 each
 other
 and
 it's
 never
 been


about
 money
 or
 jealousy
 or
 any
 of
 that


stuff.
 It's
 just
 been
 about,
 hey,
 we


like
 talking
 stocks
 and
 you
 know,
 we


like
 to
 all
 build
 together
 and
 that's


why
 it's
 so
 cool
 doing
 it
 together.


There
 you
 go.
 All
 right,
 that's
 what
 we


got.
 How
 are
 they
 nice?
 They
 didn't
 even


sing
 to
 you.
 See,
 but
 if
 Matt
 sang,
 you


know,
 I
 might
 have
 had
 to
 leave.
 You


know,
 if
 he
 did
 the
 Marilyn
 Monroe
 song,


it
 would
 have been
 a
 little
 different.


Would
 have
 been
 a
 little
 different.
 All


right.
 So,
 here's
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 do


for
 the
 next
 uh
 probably
 hour.
 I
 will


get
 to
 the
 super
 chats
 at
 the
 end.
 Uh
 we


have
 two
 things
 to
 do.
 We
 have
 some


photos
 that
 I
 promised
 I
 would
 show
 you


guys
 last
 week
 of
 my
 past.
 It's
 like
 20


photos.
 Nothing
 too
 crazy.
 It'll
 be


it'll
 be
 just
 some
 fun
 photos
 to
 run


through.
 It's
 uh
 well,
 there's
 there's


some
 embarrassing
 parts
 to
 it,
 but
 it'll


be
 fun.
 It'll
 be
 uh
 let's
 just
 say
 we're


all
 going
 to
 get
 closer
 here.
 And
 um
 and


then
 we
 have
 this
 giveaway


that
 I
 want
 to
 do
 as
 well.
 And
 I
 think


the
 way
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 it
 is
 a


giveaway.
 I
 think
 we'll
 do
 questions
 in


the
 middle
 of
 looking
 at
 photos.
 What
 do


we
 think?
 Or
 do
 we
 do
 all
 the
 giveaway


questions
 first
 and
 then
 the
 photos?


I'm
 not
 fully
 sure
 how
 we
 can
 think
 of


doing
 it,
 but


I
 think
 we
 kind
 of
 mix
 in
 the
 questions


with
 the
 photos.


Feel
 like
 that
 might
 be
 the
 easiest.
 Um,


photos
 then
 questions.


Mix,
 mix,
 mix.


Okay.
 Um,
 I
 think
 that
 works.
 Let
 me


pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.


Um,


okay.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 pull
 this
 up.


Do
 both.


Yeah,
 I
 think


I
 think
 we'll
 do
 it
 in
 the
 middle.
 I


think
 we'll
 do
 it
 in
 the
 middle.
 That


should
 work
 out.
 I'm
 putting
 these


photos
 in
 a
 corner
 so
 I
 can
 pull
 this


up.
 Do
 I
 have
 this
 here?
 Yes,
 I
 have


this.
 Perfect.
 Okay.
 Cool.
 Cool.
 So,
 I


have
 the
 photos.
 Perfect.
 And
 uh


yeah,
 we'll
 go
 from
 there.
 All
 right.


So,


we
 talked
 about
 Amcore
 earnings
 already.


We're
 not
 going
 to
 listen
 to
 the
 call


here.
 I'll
 listen
 to
 the
 call
 later.


Stock
 really
 didn't
 react.
 It
 was
 a
 good


quarter.
 Stock
 doesn't
 care
 too
 much.


3285.
 The
 only
 stock
 that
 really
 reacted


after
 hours
 was
 Celestica.
 Look
 at
 that.


Up
 11%.
 Everything
 else
 pretty
 much


flat.
 S&P
 though
 still
 moving
 which
 is


incredible.
 Nvidia
 moving,
 Tesla
 pounder


hood,
 all
 those
 moving,
 but
 the
 earnings


names
 not
 doing
 too
 much.


Okay,
 cool.
 So,
 I
 think
 we'll
 do


questions
 and
 we'll
 do
 like
 a
 photo
 and


then
 a
 question.
 Photo
 and
 then
 a


question.
 We'll
 do
 something


or
 actually
 no,
 dude.
 Because
 when
 we're


doing
 the
 photos,
 we
 might
 as
 well
 just


stick
 on
 the
 photo.
 All right,
 so
 we'll


do
 maybe
 a
 couple
 photos
 and
 then
 we'll


switch
 to
 a
 question.
 Couple
 photos,


we'll
 just
 do
 a
 question.
 We'll
 do


something
 like
 that.
 I
 think
 that's
 the


best
 way
 to
 do
 it.
 All right,
 so


uh
 let's
 get
 into
 it.
 These
 are
 in
 no


particular
 order.
 They're
 just
 uh
 you


know
 all
 all
 there


and


and
 yeah,
 this
 is
 uh


this
 is
 what
 we're
 going to
 look
 like.


So
 there
 we
 go.
 All right.
 Cool.
 So


let's
 get
 started.
 So
 I'll
 pull
 these
 up


and
 then
 uh
 we'll
 do
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 strange.


All right.
 So
 this
 is
 the
 first
 photo.


So
 here
 we
 go.
 This
 is
 uh
 let
 me
 put
 the


chapter
 in
 on
 YouTube.
 is
 birthday
 photo


special.


There
 we
 go.
 We'll
 start
 from
 here.
 So,


it'll
 start
 off
 cute
 and
 then,
 you
 know,


we'll
 we'll
 progressively
 get
 to
 the


years
 of
 me
 not
 really
 knowing
 how
 to


dress.
 So,
 this
 is
 one
 of
 my
 favorite


baby
 pictures.
 You
 guys
 can
 see
 this.


Can
 you
 see
 this
 on
 the
 screen?
 Yes.


Okay.
 So,
 this
 is
 me
 after
 I
 dropped
 um


a
 ton
 of
 rice
 on
 the
 floor
 or
 something


and
 I
 told
 myself
 I
 was
 going
 to,
 you


know,
 pick
 it
 up
 with
 with
 a
 dustpan
 and


a
 bin.
 And
 uh
 I
 told
 you
 guys
 I
 was
 a


cute
 baby,
 bro.
 I
 told
 you
 guys
 I
 was
 a


cute
 baby.
 We
 got
 the
 car
 pair
 going


crazy
 and
 my
 mom
 just
 decided
 to
 take
 a


picture
 because
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 I'm


going to
 clean
 this
 up
 myself."


So,
 he
 still
 didn't
 know
 how
 to
 dress.


Yeah,
 exactly.
 So,
 this
 was
 uh
 this
 was


the
 beginning
 of
 AK
 media
 trying
 to
 fix


up
 every
 mess
 even
 if
 I
 caused
 it.
 And


uh
 yeah,
 that's
 your
 boy
 that
 got
 dude.


Everyone
 says
 that's
 got
 to
 be
 your


sister.
 Everyone
 says
 when
 they
 look
 at


me
 my
 because
 in
 India
 also
 there's
 this


tradition
 where
 you
 don't
 cut
 a
 boy's


hair
 till
 they're
 three
 years
 old.
 So


when
 I
 was
 three
 I
 was
 bald
 but
 until
 I


was
 three
 I
 had
 a
 ton
 of
 hair.


And
 so
 yeah,
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys


saying
 that's
 your
 sister.
 It's
 me.


That's
 me.
 Big
 ass
 smile.
 I
 realized
 I


got
 caught
 trying
 to
 clean
 up
 the


kitchen
 even
 though
 I
 made
 a
 mess.
 And


you
 know,
 my
 mom
 just
 wanted
 to
 uh
 take


a
 picture
 of
 that.
 So,
 it's
 a
 cute
 baby,


bro.
 It's
 a
 cute
 baby.
 I
 don't
 know
 what


happened,
 but
 it
 was
 a
 cute
 freaking


baby.


It
 was
 a
 cute
 baby.
 All
 here's
 another


one
 in
 the
 baby
 world.


And
 uh
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 the
 the


event
 of
 this
 was.
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 why


is
 it's
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 I
 was
 going.


But
 again,
 it
 kind
 of
 looks
 like
 a
 girl,


right?
 Because
 of
 all
 the
 hair
 and


everything.
 The
 boy
 was
 cheesing
 so
 damn


hard.


You
 had
 a
 large
 mouth.
 Yes,
 I
 did.
 It


was
 It
 was
 It
 was
 a
 signal
 of
 the


yapping
 that
 was
 eventually
 going
 to


take
 place.


And
 so
 there
 you
 go.
 Bright
 smile,
 baby


swag.


First
 words
 recurrently
 right
 now.
 Dude,


when
 I
 have
 a
 kid,
 that
 is
 what
 I'm


gonna
 try
 to
 get
 their
 first
 words
 to


be.
 Don't
 say
 dada.
 Don't
 say
 mama.
 Say


currently.


Currently,
 and
 then
 say
 raite
 and
 then


say
 now.


That
 would
 be
 hilarious,
 bro,
 if
 we
 did


that.
 So,
 there
 you
 go.
 That
 was
 uh
 that


was
 your
 boy
 swagging
 it
 up
 as
 a
 uh
 as
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 baby.
 Okay,
 some
 more


pictures.
 So,
 this
 is going
 to
 be
 out
 of


order
 now.
 It's
 just
 going
 to
 be
 random


stuff
 and
 uh
 we'll
 pull
 up
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 things.
 All right,
 so
 let


let's
 just
 get
 the
 embarrassment
 part
 of


it
 over
 with.
 So
 this
 was
 one
 of
 the


photos
 I
 previewed
 last
 week
 where
 I


said,
 you
 know,
 it
 was
 going
 to
 prove


that
 I
 really
 didn't
 know
 how
 to
 dress.


This
 was
 me
 in
 ninth
 grade
 and
 I
 decided


to
 walk
 out
 of
 the
 house
 looking
 like


this
 thinking
 that
 it's
 a
 fire
 outfit.


Like
 thinking
 like
 this
 [ __ ]
 is
 legit.


Yeah,
 it
 was
 it
 wasn't
 that
 legit.
 So,


first
 of
 all,
 you
 got
 the
 camo
 shorts,


you
 got
 the
 blue
 sneakers,
 you
 got
 the


black
 and
 white
 hat,


then
 you've
 got
 this
 cardigan.
 I
 don't


know
 what
 the
 [ __ ]
 that
 I
 was
 thinking


with
 this
 cardigan,
 but
 this
 was
 uh,
 you


know,
 this
 was
 your
 boy
 back
 in
 ninth


grade.
 This
 was


this
 was
 the
 guy
 who
 was
 discovering
 the


world.


>> It
 was
 the
 real
 life
 Kevin.
 I
 told
 you


guys
 some
 of
 these
 pictures,
 bro.
 Some


of
 these
 pictures
 are
 me
 as
 a
 young


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 the
 world.


And
 uh
 yeah,
 we
 were,
 you
 know,
 we
 were


trying
 to
 figure
 [ __ ]
 out.
 We
 were


trying
 to
 figure
 [ __ ]
 out.
 So
 there
 you


go.
 That's
 that's that's
 what
 you
 got.
 I


told
 you
 guys
 this
 this
 is
 how
 it
 was


going
 to
 be.


That's
 what we
 got.
 Dude,
 I
 got
 clown


for
 this
 picture
 so
 hard
 a
 couple
 years


later.
 Like
 a
 couple
 years
 later,
 some


of
 my
 friends
 found
 this
 picture
 in
 like


it
 was
 either
 senior
 year
 or
 I
 was
 going


to
 college
 and
 they
 were
 just
 like,


"What
 were
 you
 thinking?"
 And
 I
 was


like,
 "I
 I
 I
 just
 like
 I
 thought
 I


thought
 I
 looked
 good."
 And
 they
 were


like, "You
 looked
 like
 a
 [ __ ]
 idiot."


I
 was
 like,
 "I
 know,
 but
 like
 I
 didn't


realize
 that
 at
 the
 time."
 And
 so
 it
 is


what
 it
 is.
 But
 that's
 what
 it
 looked


like.
 Oh,
 we
 got
 someone
 backstage.


Mr.
 Patel,
 what's
 up?


I
 am
 about
 to
 fly.
 So,
 I'm
 on
 the
 plane


right
 now,
 so
 I
 might
 as
 well
 just
 uh


wish
 you
 a
 happy
 birthday
 if
 I
 don't
 get


a
 chance
 to
 when
 I
 land
 and
 my
 battery


is
 dead.
 So,
 happy
 birthday,
 sir.
 I
 hope


Palunteer
 drops
 to
 your
 birthday
 number,


you
 know,
 and
 when
 it
 finally
 does,
 I'll


be
 buying
 I
 I'll
 be
 buying
 as
 many


shares
 as
 I
 can,
 but
 until
 then,
 you


know,
 happy
 birthday.
 And
 uh
 we'll
 wait


and
 see.


>> I
 So,
 you
 were
 the
 guy
 that
 Steve
 was


saying
 was
 on
 the
 plane.
 I
 was
 thinking


of
 that.
 Okay,
 gotcha.
 Thank
 you,
 Chris.


Means
 a
 lot,
 man.
 Appreciate
 you.
 For


those
 that
 know,
 Chris
 actually
 called


me
 on
 on
 uh
 Saturday
 because
 he
 thought


he
 had
 missed
 my
 birthday,
 but
 birthday


ended
 up
 being
 on
 Monday.
 So,
 appreciate


you,
 Chris.
 Thank
 you
 for
 everything.


Means
 a
 ton.


There
 you
 go.
 All
 right,
 he's
 out.
 He's


catching
 the
 flight.
 I
 was
 like,
 who
 is


Steve
 talking
 about?
 Someone
 who's
 on
 a


plane.
 I
 was
 like,
 what's
 going
 on?
 But


yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 That's
 what
 you
 had


on
 Chris.
 All
 right,
 so
 this
 was
 high


school,
 right?
 This
 was
 high
 school.


This
 was
 like,
 you
 know,
 just
 not
 the


best
 look
 in
 high
 school,
 but
 it
 really


didn't
 get
 that
 much
 better
 in
 college.


I
 mean,
 it
 really
 didn't.
 So,
 this
 was


this
 was
 Okay,
 so
 the
 story
 behind
 the


next
 picture
 is
 that
 um
 I
 had
 just


finished
 one
 of
 my
 first
 consulting


contracts
 for
 the
 public
 speaking
 and


debate
 consulting
 firm
 I
 started


literally
 when
 I
 was
 uh
 what
 in
 junior


year
 of
 high
 school.
 And
 uh
 I
 just
 got


paid
 a
 fat
 check.
 I
 got
 paid
 $3,000
 and


I
 was
 like,
 it
 was
 like,
 it
 was
 New


Year's
 Eve.
 I
 was
 like,
 you
 know
 what?


I'm
 gonna
 go
 throw
 a
 party
 at
 the


apartment.
 So,
 at
 the
 apartment
 I
 was


renting
 at
 the
 time.
 So,
 I
 was
 like,


"Okay,
 I'm
 going
 to
 take
 all
 my
 money


and
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 buy
 a
 ton
 of


alcohol."
 And
 so,
 what
 did
 I
 do?
 I


bought
 a
 ton
 of
 alcohol,
 as
 you
 can
 see


right
 here.
 Now,
 what
 did
 I
 do
 with
 the


outfit?
 I
 don't
 know.
 Okay,
 you
 got


these
 pink
 pants.
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 I


got
 pink
 pants
 from.
 Then
 you've
 got


these
 like
 dress
 shoes.
 Then
 you've
 got


this
 blazer
 on
 top
 of
 this
 blue
 shirt


with
 a
 black
 tie.
 It
 doesn't
 even
 like


you
 should
 be
 wearing
 a
 bright
 tie
 if


you're
 wearing
 pink
 pants.
 And
 then
 the


hair
 is
 just
 going
 crazy.
 And
 then
 the


caption
 on
 Snapchat
 was
 I
 swear
 this
 is


one
 of
 my
 best
 photos
 in
 my
 college


career.
 That's
 not
 even
 how
 you
 spell


career.


So
 again,
 this
 was,
 you
 know,
 it's
 like


it
 was
 it
 was
 it
 was
 just
 part
 of
 being


in
 college,
 I
 guess
 you
 can
 say.
 It
 was


a
 fun
 night,
 though.
 I
 bought
 so
 much.
 I


ordered
 so
 I
 basically
 blew
 half
 of
 the


check
 buying
 alcohol
 and
 pizza
 because
 I


wanted
 to
 like
 throw
 a
 party
 in
 my
 own


like
 I
 had
 thrown
 parties
 before,
 but
 I


wanted
 to
 like
 be
 the
 actual
 host
 that


like
 really
 throws
 a
 party.
 Maybe
 that's


why
 I
 love
 doing
 the
 meetup
 so
 much.
 I


always
 like
 hosting
 and
 so
 I
 did
 it.
 I


just
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 this
 outfit
 came


from.


Dan
 Ies
 2.0.


Oh
 my
 gosh.
 Is
 that
 how
 you
 pronounce


it?
 No,
 I
 just
 I
 maybe
 I
 was
 drunk
 when


I
 was
 typing
 the
 caption
 in,
 bro.
 But


like
 like
 who
 spells
 career
 like
 that?


Like
 what?
 Like
 it's
 just
 everything


about
 this
 is
 horrible.


How
 are
 you
 ranked
 US7?
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


don't
 know.
 But
 it
 happened.
 So
 there


you
 go.
 Those
 were
 the
 uh
 those
 were


some
 of
 the
 college
 days.
 Okay,
 what


else
 do
 we
 got?
 Um
 well,
 this
 this
 photo


I
 think
 was
 interesting.
 This
 outfit


wasn't
 as
 horrible,
 but
 this
 actually


was
 my
 birthday
 five
 years
 ago
 and
 it


was
 in
 Jersey
 City
 where
 I
 live
 now
 and


uh
 it's
 such
 a
 [ __ ]
 boy
 picture
 to
 be


honest,
 but
 like
 I
 was
 I
 was
 I
 was


sitting
 on
 the
 edge
 of
 Exchange
 Place


and
 now
 like
 I
 go
 there
 almost
 every


other
 day
 when
 I'm
 eating
 lunch.
 And
 so


I
 remember
 when
 I
 took
 this
 picture
 uh


or
 when
 my
 friends
 took
 this
 picture
 of


me,
 I
 was
 so
 inspired
 by
 the
 New
 York


City
 skyline
 and
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 man,


one
 day,
 like
 one
 day
 I
 want
 to
 like
 be


close
 to
 this.
 And
 I'm
 not
 in
 the
 city,


which
 I'm
 actually
 happy
 because
 taxes


are
 about
 to
 go
 up
 a
 lot
 in
 the
 city,


but
 I'm
 close
 to
 the
 city.
 Very
 close
 to


the
 city.
 And
 so
 a
 little
 bit
 of a
 full


circle
 moment
 for
 me
 five
 years
 later,


actually
 getting
 to
 live.
 Was
 that
 It's


technically
 six
 years.
 No,
 it's
 five.


Yeah.
 20.
 This
 was
 October
 2020.


October.
 Yeah.
 So,
 five
 years
 later


and
 so
 living
 there
 now.
 Indian
 boy
 band


cover.
 Exactly.


But
 it
 is
 nice
 to
 uh
 be
 back
 and
 share


some
 of
 those
 memories.
 All
 right,
 let's


get
 into
 some
 juicy
 pictures.
 Let's
 get


into
 some
 other
 pictures
 that
 we
 got.
 Um


so,
 let's
 just
 see.
 We're
 going
 to
 run


through
 a
 couple
 of
 them
 and
 see
 what
 we


got
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 go
 through
 some
 of


them
 as
 we
 as
 we
 progress
 through
 memory


lane.
 Oh,
 I
 I
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 know
 folks.


I
 don't
 know
 about
 you,
 but
 I
 I
 think


that's
 a
 woman.
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 woman


right
 there.
 That
 that
 to
 me
 looks
 like


a
 woman.
 So
 that
 that's
 a
 picture
 of
 me


with
 a
 woman.
 Let's
 go
 to
 the
 next


picture.
 Oh,
 wow.
 Folks,
 I
 don't
 know


about
 you,
 but
 I
 think
 that's
 another


woman.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 almost
 like
 someone


who
 curated
 these
 pictures
 was
 trying
 to


uh
 paint
 a
 particular
 narrative


around
 their
 sexual.
 I
 don't
 know.
 But


like
 that
 is
 another
 woman
 if
 I'm
 not


wrong.
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 it's
 not
 AI,


bro.
 Get
 out
 of
 here.
 Freaking
 AI


nonsense.
 Not
 AI.
 All right,
 next
 one.


Wow,
 that's
 another
 I
 can't
 believe
 it.


That's
 another
 woman.
 That
 is


incredible.
 Whoever
 cultivated
 these


pictures
 really
 must
 have
 been
 putting


in
 some
 work
 to
 to
 to
 find
 the
 memories


of
 someone's
 life.
 All right,
 let's
 go


to
 the
 next
 one.
 Wow,
 another
 one.
 This


is
 just
 crazy,
 bro.
 This
 is
 I
 didn't


cultiv
 I
 you
 know
 I
 had
 my
 assistant.
 I


told
 you
 guys
 I've
 been
 hiring
 an


assistant
 assistant
 assistant.
 I
 told


them
 to
 handle
 this.
 I
 didn't
 know
 they


were
 going
 to
 put
 these
 many
 photos
 with


with
 females
 here,
 but
 nonetheless,
 I


mean,
 like,
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 It
 is
 what


it
 is.
 Let's
 look
 at
 the
 next
 one.
 Oh,


wow.
 It
 just
 happened
 to
 be
 another
 Wow,


that's
 pretty
 incredible.
 This
 is


actually
 one
 of
 my
 best
 friends.
 This
 is


uh
 this
 is
 Sherry.
 I
 love
 Sherry
 so


much.
 I
 still
 I
 still
 talk
 to
 her,
 but


she's
 like
 legit
 one
 of my
 best
 friends.


But
 just
 then,
 you
 have
 so
 many
 nice


sisters.
 Dude,
 I
 hate
 you
 guys.
 This
 is


Sora.
 This
 is
 not
 Sora.


Goodness
 gracious.
 This
 is
 Sora.


Gemini
 2.0.


There
 you
 go.
 There
 you
 go.
 This
 is


actually
 Sherry.
 This
 is
 one
 of
 my
 good


friends.
 So,
 uh
 I
 do
 love
 Sherry.
 All


right.
 So,
 some
 other
 pictures
 right


here.
 Now,
 these
 three
 I
 think
 I
 showed


this
 picture
 a
 while
 ago,
 but
 these


three
 were
 actually
 three
 of
 my
 best


friends
 who
 were
 girls.
 I
 didn't
 date


any
 of
 them,
 but
 uh
 these
 three,
 Mona,


Sherry,
 and
 Tam.
 I
 keep
 in
 contact
 with


a
 couple
 of
 them.
 Uh,
 some
 of
 them
 just


moved
 away,
 so
 it's
 been
 a
 while
 since


I've
 talked
 to
 them,
 but
 you
 know,
 these


were
 three
 of
 my
 best
 friends
 back
 in


college.
 And,
 you
 know,
 I
 I've
 said
 this


over
 and
 over
 again.
 You
 know,
 some
 some


people
 that
 are
 new
 to
 the
 channel


probably
 have
 not
 heard
 it,
 but
 I
 have


always
 had
 girls,
 girl
 best
 friends
 in


my
 life.
 I
 don't
 know
 why,
 but
 like


genuinely,
 I've
 always
 had
 girl
 best


friends
 in
 my
 life.
 And
 I
 don't
 know,
 I


don't
 know
 why.
 Like,
 I
 really
 have
 not


had
 that
 many
 guy
 best
 friends
 as
 I've


had
 girl
 best
 friends.
 So,
 it's
 not
 the


gay
 best
 friend.
 see
 like
 everything


every
 narrative
 you
 can't
 you
 can't


navigate


it
 isn't
 helping
 the
 allegations
 but
 no


I
 I
 really
 have
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 friends
 who


have
 been
 girls
 who've
 been
 best
 friends


I
 I
 think
 there's
 you
 know
 I
 think


there's
 a
 level
 of
 uh
 femininity
 that
 I


have
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 listening
 because


like
 the
 one
 thing
 women
 are
 really
 good


at
 is
 listening
 and
 I
 think
 quite


frankly
 and
 this
 is
 very
 logical
 here
 to


be
 a
 good
 communicator
 to
 be
 a
 good


debater
 to
 be
 a
 good
 interviewer
 you


need
 to
 listen
 because
 to
 form
 your
 next


question
 to
 follow
 up
 on
 an
 idea
 needs


to
 be
 able
 to
 listen
 to
 the
 ideas
 that


are
 presented
 in
 the
 first
 place.
 And
 I


think
 I've
 been
 a
 really
 good
 listener


my
 whole
 life
 when
 it
 comes
 to


conversating,


you
 know,
 with
 the
 opposite
 gender.
 And


so,
 as
 a
 result,
 that's
 what's
 led
 to
 uh


that's
 what's
 led
 to
 uh
 more
 friends
 who


are
 girl.
 Women
 are
 not
 good
 listeners.


Okay,
 maybe
 not
 all
 women
 are
 good


listeners,
 but
 they're
 definitely
 better


listeners
 than
 guys.
 Let's
 just
 be


objective.
 Guys
 freaking
 suck
 at


listening.


Bro,
 you're
 yapping
 all
 day.
 Okay,
 but


the
 the
 yapping
 is
 due
 to
 the
 ability
 to


listen
 to,
 you
 know,
 what
 people
 are


saying.
 Tanner
 says
 28
 is
 a
 good
 age
 to


come
 out.
 Tanner,
 if
 Sofi
 doesn't
 hit
 35


tomorrow,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 talk.


We're
 gonna
 have
 to
 freaking
 talk.


Here's
 another
 picture
 with
 uh
 three
 of


those
 friends.
 We
 were
 at
 a
 bar
 in


Ruckers.


I
 think
 this
 was
 2020.
 This
 was
 right


before
 the
 world
 shut
 down
 back
 in


freaking
 COVID
 time.
 This
 was
 like
 the


last
 couple
 nights
 we
 even
 got
 to
 go
 out


and
 have
 some
 fun.
 But
 these
 these


really
 were
 some
 of
 my
 best
 friends
 and


so
 it
 was
 cool
 uh
 cool
 conversating
 with


them.
 This
 is
 another
 picture.
 This
 was


my
 first
 car.
 You
 had
 the
 Honda
 Civic


2019.


I
 was
 not
 in
 a
 sorority.
 I
 was
 in
 a


fraternity.
 It
 was
 a
 co-ed
 fraternity.


It
 was
 like
 a
 business
 fraternity
 alpha


capasai.


And
 uh
 yeah,
 this
 was
 my
 first
 car.
 I


think
 I
 put
 5,000
 down
 on
 this
 car
 and


it
 was
 what,
 21,000?
 Oh,
 and
 the
 funny


story
 about
 this
 car,
 I
 crashed
 it
 a


week
 after
 buying
 it.
 So,
 I
 bought
 the


car
 $5,000
 down.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 the


interest
 was
 like
 3.2%.


The
 monthly
 payment
 was
 $311.
 I
 paid
 it


off
 back
 in
 April
 of
 2024.
 Then
 I


crashed
 it
 into
 our
 garage
 because
 for


some
 reason
 I
 put
 my
 foot
 on
 the
 pedal


versus
 my
 foot
 on
 the
 the
 brake
 as
 I
 was


pulling
 up
 and
 I
 and
 I
 ran
 into
 the


garage.
 And
 so
 it
 cost
 another
 $1,900
 to


replace
 the
 uh
 the
 car.
 So
 whatever


discount
 we
 negotiated,
 we
 being
 me
 and


my
 dad,
 it
 ended
 up
 just
 being
 paid


back.
 So
 that's
 uh
 you
 know
 that's
 what


you
 had.
 But
 um
 yeah,
 that
 was
 a
 fun


time.
 All right,
 here's
 another
 photo.


So,
 this
 was
 with
 my
 boy
 David.
 Me
 and


David
 were
 We're
 not
 as
 close
 anymore,


but
 we
 were
 really
 close.
 We
 were
 doing


this
 event
 and
 we
 dressed
 up
 and
 uh
 this


was
 during
 COVID
 and
 we
 like
 we
 put
 on


the
 suit
 and
 tie
 and
 stuff
 and
 David
 is


uh
 David
 is
 one
 of
 my
 best
 friends
 and
 I


think
 last
 time
 we
 talked
 was
 a
 couple


months
 ago,
 but
 he's
 been
 super
 busy
 as


well.
 So,
 this
 was
 back
 in
 2020
 and
 uh


yeah,
 shout
 out
 to
 David.
 David,
 you


know,
 David
 initially
 and
 I,
 David
 and
 I


wanted
 to
 do
 a
 podcast
 and
 we
 we
 did
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 podcast
 and
 it
 was
 a


little
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 comedic
 podcast,


although
 none
 of
 us
 were
 really
 that


funny
 and
 we
 I
 didn't
 understand
 social


media
 and
 content.
 So,
 the
 the
 videos
 we


were
 putting
 out
 like
 really
 weren't


going
 anywhere.
 And
 but
 but
 the
 fact


that
 we
 went
 through
 that
 content


journey
 together,
 I
 thought
 was
 super


important
 because,
 you
 know,
 without


that
 journey,
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 would


have
 been
 or
 I
 wouldn't
 have
 been
 where


I
 was
 today.


But
 that
 was
 super
 fun
 as
 well.
 Lance


says,
 "I'm
 an
 AK
 simmit.
 I
 love
 it.


I
 was an
 AKI
 as
 well,
 so
 it
 was
 fun.
 You


know what's
 actually
 funny
 about
 AKsI?


By
 the
 way,
 SoFi
 is
 making
 a
 move
 after


hours.
 So,
 Tanner
 is
 safe
 for
 now.
 Look


at
 that.
 30.35.


Our
 chapter
 at
 Ruckers
 at
 AKI
 got
 caught


drinking
 at
 the
 end
 of
 2020
 in
 a
 party.


And
 apparently
 based
 on
 some
 university


bylaws,
 you're
 like
 not
 allowed
 to


drink,
 which
 like
 yeah,
 every
 university


says
 you're
 not
 allowed
 to
 drink
 at


these
 frat
 parties,
 but
 like
 obviously


everyone
 drinks.
 We
 ended
 up
 getting


caught
 somehow
 at
 the
 year
 I
 graduated,


so
 I
 didn't
 care
 too
 much.
 But
 we
 got


banned
 for
 seven
 years.


And
 so
 like
 the
 chapter
 is
 just
 opening


up
 again
 on
 Ruckers,
 but
 they
 banned
 the


freaking
 frat
 for
 seven
 years.
 It
 was


like
 six
 or
 seven
 years,
 something
 like


that.
 But
 after
 I
 graduated,
 there
 was


no
 like
 connection
 to
 the
 fraternity


because
 the
 fraternity
 was
 gone,
 which


was
 crazy,
 bro.
 Like
 really,
 they're


going
 to
 ban
 someone
 for
 drinking
 at
 a


freaking
 party
 like
 like
 every
 other


fraternity
 doesn't
 drink
 at
 parties.
 But


yeah,
 that
 was
 stupid.
 But
 that's
 what


we
 had.
 It
 It
 was


six
 or
 It
 really
 was.
 I
 can't
 remember


exactly,
 but
 I
 remember
 getting
 the


email
 in
 the
 summer
 of
 2020
 and
 I
 was


just
 like,
 "Oh,
 the
 fraternity
 is
 done.


Like
 there's
 no
 connection
 to
 like
 after


years
 people
 are
 not
 going
 to
 care
 that


much
 about
 this."
 And
 so
 they
 they
 nuked


the
 fraternity,
 but
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 Uh


here's
 another
 picture.
 Again,
 my


assistant,
 she
 she
 put
 all
 the
 pictures


together.
 I
 didn't
 I
 didn't
 know
 she


would
 pick
 me
 with
 all
 the
 opposite


genders
 in
 these
 photos,
 but
 it
 is
 what


it
 is.
 So
 that's
 what
 you
 got.
 You
 got


another
 got
 another
 fun
 photo
 right


there.
 All
 right,
 some
 of
 the
 debate


stuff.
 This
 was
 me,
 semi-
 finalist
 at


the
 Georgia
 Invitational
 for
 Lincoln


Douglas.
 So,
 your
 boy
 had
 a
 nice
 little


trophy
 right
 there.
 And
 then
 this
 was


me,
 top
 speaker
 at
 the
 NDCA
 Championship


as
 well.
 This
 was
 ironically
 also
 in


Georgia.
 No,
 this
 was
 in
 Florida.
 This


was
 in
 Florida.


So,
 those
 are
 some
 of
 the
 debate


pictures
 of
 the
 past
 and
 uh
 some
 of
 the


wins


as
 a
 as
 a
 debater.


And
 those
 are
 most
 of the
 photos.
 I


mean,
 we
 have
 a
 couple
 more
 right
 here.


This
 is
 me
 again
 making
 a
 mess.
 This
 I


should
 have
 sewn
 this
 when
 Steve
 was
 on.


I
 don't
 know
 why
 I
 uh


I
 don't
 know
 why
 I
 kept
 making
 a
 mess
 in


the
 house.
 I
 guess
 that's
 what
 babies


do,
 but
 I
 made
 a
 mess
 and
 all
 those


cookies
 fell
 again.
 I
 was
 trying
 to


clean
 it
 up.
 My
 mom
 was
 like,
 "We're


just
 going
 to
 take
 a
 picture
 of
 this."


Tanner
 says,
 "Imit
 said
 lots
 of
 pics
 of


girls,
 please.
 Only
 like
 one
 photo
 of


David."
 You
 know,
 I
 didn't
 say
 that,
 but


I
 gave
 her
 access
 to
 all
 my
 photos
 and


she
 just
 decided
 to
 pick
 the
 ones
 that


she
 thought
 you
 guys
 would
 like.
 So,
 you


know,
 maybe
 she's
 uh
 maybe
 she's
 trying


to
 combat
 some
 some
 narratives
 that


exist
 on
 this
 channel.
 Who
 knows?
 Who


knows?


But
 she
 did
 what
 she
 had
 to
 do.
 Tess


says,
 "Why
 do
 you
 look
 different


collecting
 awards
 to
 slaying
 with
 the


baddies?
 Don't
 look
 like
 the
 same


person."
 Well,
 in
 high
 school,
 dude.
 I


mean,
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 is
 high
 school
 to


college,
 so
 you
 know.


High
 school
 was
 just
 high
 school.
 And


then
 as
 you
 move
 on,
 you
 you
 get


somewhat
 better
 at
 navigating
 how
 you


look
 and


didn't
 really
 change
 too
 much
 in
 regards


to
 how
 I
 dress,
 but
 nonetheless,
 there's


another
 picture
 with
 two
 of
 those


friends
 who
 are
 girls
 that
 were
 some
 of


my
 good
 friends.
 This
 was
 Halloween


2019.


Halloween
 2019.
 I
 think
 I
 was
 the
 Joker.


I
 think
 that's
 what
 I
 was
 going
 for.


And
 uh
 yeah,
 these
 were
 also
 some
 really


good
 friends
 back
 in
 the
 college
 days.


So
 it
 was
 fun
 stuff.
 So
 the
 these


actually
 were
 some
 of
 my
 really
 good


best
 friends.
 And
 although
 we
 don't
 keep


in
 contact
 as
 much
 anymore,
 you
 know,


during
 the
 time
 college
 was
 was
 a
 good


one.
 All
 right,
 here's
 the
 last
 photo.


Here's
 the
 last
 photo.
 This
 one


This
 one
 is
 ridiculous,
 bro.
 This
 is
 me


in
 sixth
 grade.
 This
 [ __ ]
 is
 rid
 I
 don't


know
 how
 that
 guy


did
 what
 he
 did
 in
 life.
 But
 that
 dude,


someone
 is
 gonna
 crop
 that
 and
 turn
 it


into
 a
 meme.
 This
 was
 uh
 ironically
 the


guy's
 name
 in
 this
 picture
 is
 Benny.
 So


shout
 out
 to
 I'm
 Benny
 and
 then
 the
 girl


is
 Victoria.
 We
 were
 at
 her
 house
 after


school.
 I
 remember
 this.
 This
 was
 2010.


She
 had
 just
 gotten
 a
 Mac
 and
 she
 had


photo
 booth.
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 I
 got


these
 glasses
 from.
 my
 I
 mean
 it's
 like


a
 mushroom
 haircut,
 no
 beard,
 facial


hair,
 but


yeah,
 that's
 that
 was
 me
 in
 sixth
 grade.


So,
 I
 tried
 to
 find
 the
 pictures
 of
 me


performing
 Billy
 Gene
 at
 the
 talent


show.
 I
 couldn't
 find
 them.
 I
 was
 going


to
 show
 you
 guys
 that,
 but
 your
 boy
 did


uh
 perform


a
 Michael
 Jackson
 imitation.
 I
 won
 first


place,
 but
 I
 just
 couldn't
 find
 those.


So
 yeah,
 your
 boy
 uh
 your
 boy
 is
 how
 is


is
 how
 I
 that
 is
 how
 I
 developed
 over


the
 course
 of
 28
 years.
 That
 picture
 is


kind
 of
 crazy
 because
 I
 actually


remember
 this
 day
 fully.
 Like
 I
 remember


going
 to
 her
 house,
 being
 on
 photo


booth,
 you
 know,
 just
 like
 messing


around,
 watching
 TV.
 It's
 a
 crazy
 crazy


evolution.
 And
 then
 this
 picture,
 you


know,
 wanting
 to
 get
 close
 to
 the
 city


and
 now
 I
 I
 live
 very
 close
 to
 this


exact
 place,
 which
 is
 so
 cool
 to
 kind
 of


come.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 this
 picture
 I
 was


broke.
 This
 is
 this
 in
 this
 picture
 I


was
 down
 $25,000
 on
 Purple
 Biotech,


PPPT.


And
 uh
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 I
 was
 acting
 like
 I


was
 cool
 in
 the
 picture.
 I
 was
 dead


broke.
 I
 was
 I
 was
 down.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 had


my
 consulting
 clients
 which
 was
 paying


the
 bills,
 but
 like
 outside
 of
 that,
 I


was
 I
 was
 barely
 making
 the
 $311
 car


payment
 on
 the
 Honda
 Civic.
 Like
 every


month
 when
 when
 it
 when
 it
 took
 the


money
 out
 of
 my
 it
 usually
 was
 an


overdraft
 when
 I
 took
 the
 money
 out
 of


the
 account
 and
 that's
 why
 I
 got
 so


that's
 honestly
 one
 of the
 reasons
 I
 got


excited
 about
 SoFi
 because
 in
 2022
 when


I
 heard
 no
 overdrafts,
 I
 was
 getting


killed
 with
 these
 stupid
 overdraft
 fees


by
 Bank
 of
 America
 and
 I
 was
 like,


"Dude,
 like
 I
 might
 need
 another
 day
 to


make
 the
 payment,
 but
 like
 just
 don't


charge
 me
 $18."
 like
 like
 how
 like
 you


guys
 can't
 wait
 a
 day.
 Is
 it
 that


serious?


And
 so,
 you
 know,
 that
 that's
 initially


what
 got
 me
 interested
 even
 in
 in
 the


neo
 banking
 category.
 But
 but
 I
 was


broke
 in
 that
 picture.
 I
 was
 dead
 broke.


And
 yeah,
 as
 Melanie
 says,
 I
 was
 looking


towards
 the
 future.


I
 was
 looking
 towards
 the
 future
 there.


So,


there
 you
 go.
 Full
 circle
 to
 taking
 your


yacht
 across
 that.
 Yeah,
 exactly.
 That


that
 that
 that
 area
 is
 probably
 where


the
 ferry
 goes,
 aka
 my
 yacht.
 And
 so


very
 very
 full
 circle.
 Very
 full
 circle.


All
 right,
 so
 that's
 all
 the
 pictures.


Let's
 uh
 let's
 get
 into
 the
 giveaways.


We'll
 do
 this
 again.
 We'll
 do
 this


probably
 like
 New
 Year's
 or
 Christmas.


We'll
 this
 kind
 of
 fun.
 We
 can
 just
 get


old
 pictures
 from
 the
 past
 and
 show
 you


guys
 a
 ton
 of
 stuff.
 Again,
 shout
 out
 to


my
 assistant.
 Deeply
 deeply
 appreciate


the
 curation
 of
 photos
 that
 she
 brought


up
 to
 show
 everybody.
 I
 mean,
 I
 you


know,
 I
 I
 didn't
 know
 exactly
 what


picture
 she
 would
 take.
 I
 didn't
 give


her
 any
 agenda.
 I
 just
 gave
 her
 access


to
 all
 my
 accounts
 and
 I
 said, "Hey,


find
 some
 pictures
 you
 think
 people


would
 like."
 And,
 you
 know,
 there


happened
 to
 be
 a
 trend
 in
 the
 picture.


Maybe
 there
 was
 just,
 you
 know,
 an


overwhelming
 amount
 of
 of
 of
 of
 pictures


that
 uh
 couldn't
 be
 denied.


So,
 as
 a
 result,
 that's
 why
 they
 showed


up.


It
 was
 not
 Sora.
 It's
 not
 AI.
 It's
 not


Gemini.


Not
 my
 sister.
 Assistant
 was
 his
 mom.


No,
 it
 wasn't.
 Assistant
 wasn't
 my
 mom.


Dude,
 my
 mom
 bought
 some
 SoFi
 today
 as


well.
 She
 called
 me.
 She's
 like,
 "I


bought
 some
 SoFi."
 I
 was
 like, "All


right,
 mom.
 Tanner's
 either
 going
 to


make
 us
 rich
 or
 we're
 going
 to
 lose
 our


money.
 We're
 going
 to
 see.


We're
 going
 to
 see."
 All right,
 cool.
 I


think
 this
 only
 helped
 the
 allegations.


Probably.
 Probably
 only
 help
 the


allegations.
 All right,
 so
 this
 is
 what


we're
 going
 to
 do
 for
 the
 um
 for
 the


for
 the
 for
 the
 giveaways.


Wow,
 Samantha
 just
 said
 happy
 birthday.


That's
 actually
 a
 different
 Samantha.


There's
 actually
 two.
 If
 you
 read
 the


Dualingo
 article,
 there's
 one
 Samantha


and
 then
 there's
 a
 different
 Samantha.


This
 Samantha
 is
 not
 the
 Dolingo


Samantha,
 but
 she's
 another
 Samantha.
 I


love
 that
 name
 so
 much,
 bro.
 Samantha


like
 that.
 It
 is
 one
 of
 my
 f
 So,
 two


names
 I
 love
 for
 a
 girl.
 I
 don't
 know


why
 I
 just
 love
 it.
 Samantha
 and
 then


Bella.
 those
 two
 names.
 Like
 I've
 I've


just
 always
 loved
 those
 names.
 Samantha


and
 Isabella
 and
 Samantha.


I
 just
 always
 love
 those
 names
 for
 some


reason.
 I
 don't
 know
 why.


Yeah.
 Shout
 out
 to
 Sam
 if
 you're


watching.
 Sam
 is
 a
 is
 a
 close
 friend


from
 high
 school
 as
 well.
 Um
 she


actually
 was
 on
 the
 stream
 back
 in
 2022


for
 those
 that
 remember.
 She
 she
 showed


up
 on
 a
 couple
 of
 streams
 just
 to
 talk


philosophy
 and
 stuff.
 Okay,
 cool.
 So


this
 is
 what
 we're
 gonna
 do.
 from
 loves


Twilight.
 Yeah,
 exactly.
 Um,
 all right.


So,
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 10
 questions,


$100
 each.
 Uh,
 and
 we're
 going to
 do
 the


giveaway.
 Now,
 here's
 the
 thing.
 So,
 two


things.
 Number
 one,
 I
 have
 a
 new
 email


that
 everyone
 can
 write
 down.
 It
 is


emitcourag.comgmail.com.


So,
 for
 those
 that
 have
 been
 trying
 to


get
 in
 touch
 for
 whatever
 reason,
 you're


trying
 to
 get
 in
 touch,
 Twitter
 DMs
 is


really
 tough
 because
 it's
 it's
 just
 hard


to
 break
 through
 the
 noise
 on
 Twitter.


and
 then
 um
 you
 know
 sending
 a
 message


on


I
 don't
 know
 like
 there's
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 like
 to
 my
 other
 emails
 or


something
 it
 just
 gets
 kind
 of
 crowded.


So
 for
 anyone
 who
 actually
 wants
 to
 get


in
 contact
 or
 say
 something
 I
 will
 try


to
 check
 this
 email
 every
 day
 try
 to


respond
 to
 everyone.
 It
 is
 midcuper.com.


If
 you
 are
 a
 winner
 today
 please
 send
 it


to
 this
 email.
 This
 is
 the
 email


to
 screenshot
 your
 answer
 and
 your


YouTube
 account
 profile


and
 then
 I
 will
 send
 you
 a
 $100
 Amazon


gift
 card.
 So,
 we're
 gonna
 do
 $100


Amazon,
 PayPal,
 Venmo
 gets
 a
 little
 bit


too
 dicey
 because
 people
 are
 across
 the


world.
 So,
 we're
 just
 going
 to
 do
 a


hundred
 bucks
 Amazon
 and
 uh
 if
 you


really
 don't
 want
 the
 Amazon,
 let
 me


know
 and
 we
 can
 just
 do
 like
 pure
 cash.


But
 we'll
 do
 Amazon
 and
 we'll
 give
 those


away.


So,
 that
 is
 the
 email.
 Yes,
 bullish


Amazon.
 We
 need
 to
 Yeah,
 we
 need
 to
 help


if
 they're
 cutting
 all
 these
 workers.
 We


need
 to
 make
 sure
 it's
 not
 a
 demand


issue
 and
 uh
 help
 some
 of
 the
 the


earnings
 account.
 Okay,
 so
 I
 don't
 have


all
 my
 questions.
 I
 tried
 to
 think
 of
 as


many
 questions
 as
 I
 can.
 I
 I
 these


questions
 there
 might
 be
 a
 mix
 of
 stock


market
 stuff,
 might
 be
 a
 mix
 of
 just


stuff
 on
 the
 channel.
 I
 tried
 to
 do


questions
 that
 were
 hard
 enough
 where


not
 everyone
 can
 immediately
 spam
 the


answer
 at
 the
 same
 time
 because
 I
 know


people
 are
 going
 to
 say,
 "Well,
 I
 was


first.
 I
 was
 first."
 And
 like
 I
 have
 one


iPad.
 Okay,
 this
 iPad
 is
 what
 I'm
 using.


Whoever
 pops
 in
 first
 on
 my
 iPad
 is
 what


I'm
 going
 to
 see.
 Sometimes
 you
 might
 be


first
 on
 your
 internet.
 I
 really
 can't


do
 anything
 about
 it.
 I
 am
 sorry.
 I


hopefully
 we
 can
 just
 do
 more
 and
 more


giveaways
 in
 the
 future,
 but
 every


single


uh
 chat
 I
 see
 and
 it's
 pretty
 quick.
 I


mean,
 this
 is
 not
 Streamyard
 that
 has
 a


delay.
 This
 is
 pretty
 quick.
 So,
 whoever


I
 see
 first,
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 one


that
 we
 we
 give
 the
 giveaway
 to.
 All


right,
 cool.
 Here
 we
 go.
 First
 question,


first
 one
 to
 type
 it.
 And
 again,
 please


send
 me
 the
 information
 by
 tonight.
 I


will
 try
 to
 get
 you
 the
 Amazon
 gift


cards
 by
 tomorrow.
 So,
 please
 send
 it
 by


tonight.
 All right.
 Here
 we
 go.
 This
 one


should
 be
 relatively
 easy,
 but
 maybe
 not


the
 easiest
 for
 everybody.


Okay.


What
 was
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 spell
 it


perfectly,
 but
 if
 you
 if
 if if
 the


intent
 of
 your
 spelling
 is
 good
 enough,


then
 that's
 the
 case.
 Okay.
 So,
 I'll
 let


you
 know
 if
 there's
 some
 answers
 where


you
 have
 to
 spell
 it
 perfectly.
 This
 one


is
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 I'll
 pretty
 much


understand
 if
 you're
 getting
 the
 gist
 of


the
 answer,
 even
 if
 you
 don't
 spell
 it


correctly.


What
 was
 the
 Pokemon
 character
 that
 I


got
 gifted
 a
 physical
 thick
 version
 of?


What
 was
 the
 Pokemon
 character
 that
 I


got
 gifted
 a
 physical
 thick
 version
 of?


Thick.
 T
 I
 T
 H
 I
 C.


T
 H
 I
 C
 is
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 thick.


Awesome.
 K
 h.
 You
 got
 it.
 Charizard.


Awesome.
 Kh.
 You
 got
 it.
 Charizard
 is


the
 answer.


Awesome.
 Kher,


Charizard
 is
 indeed
 the
 answer.
 There


you
 go.
 That
 was
 pretty
 easy.
 If
 you're


not
 part
 of
 the
 channel,
 you
 probably


missed
 it,
 but


uh
 Ray
 said,
 "I
 don't
 know."
 Shout
 out


to
 Ray
 who
 got
 me
 the
 thick
 Charizard.


It's
 over
 there
 in
 the
 corner.
 Let
 me


get
 it
 right
 here.
 There
 it
 is.


This
 is
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about.
 There


you
 go.


the
 thick
 Charizard.
 So,
 shout
 out
 to


Ray.
 Awesome.
 Kher,


there
 you
 go.
 You
 are
 the
 winner.
 That's


who
 we
 got.
 All right,
 second
 one.
 This


one
 goes
 back
 to
 kind
 of
 the
 OG
 days


because
 I
 don't
 talk
 about
 it
 too
 much.


I'm
 looking
 for
 two
 words.
 Okay,
 two


words
 on
 this.
 You
 can
 put
 them
 in


whatever
 order,
 but
 I'm
 looking
 for
 two


words.


Two
 words.


Uh,
 it
 is
 a
 type
 of
 a
 product.
 It's
 not


you
 don't
 I'll
 just
 give
 you
 a
 hint.


It's
 not
 a
 color.
 Okay,
 it's
 not
 a


color.
 Okay,
 that's
 the
 hint.
 What
 is


the
 type
 of
 Gatorade
 I
 love
 to
 drink?


Two
 words.
 What
 is
 the
 type
 of
 Gatorade


I
 love
 to
 drink?


What
 is
 the
 type
 of
 great
 Gatorade
 I


love
 to
 drink?
 Who
 said
 mayo
 Gatorade?


What
 are
 we
 talking
 about?
 Mayo


Gatorade.


Two
 colors
 or
 sorry,
 two
 two
 words.


Ah,
 no
 one's
 got
 it
 yet.
 No
 one's
 got
 it


yet.
 Two
 words.
 Oh,
 D
 LLM.


Let
 me
 make
 sure
 you
 got
 it.


You
 got
 it.
 D
 LLM123.


Zero
 calorie.


Zero
 calorie.


Zero
 calorie
 is
 the
 answer.
 I
 I
 like
 the


blue
 one
 a
 lot,
 but
 I
 I
 didn't
 want
 to


make
 it
 that
 specific
 to
 like
 the
 point


of
 the
 flavor
 because
 that
 would
 be
 hard


to
 guess.
 But
 zero
 calorie,
 if
 you've


been
 watching
 for
 a
 while,
 I
 usually


only
 drink
 zerocalorie
 Gatorade
 because


it
 tastes
 like
 regular
 Gatorade,
 but


it's
 zero
 calories.
 So,
 DLLM123,


you
 are
 you
 are
 the
 winner.
 And
 I
 don't


see
 anyone
 who
 puts
 zero
 before
 you.


And
 those
 were
 the
 exact
 two
 words.
 Zero


calorie.
 That's
 that
 was
 a
 little
 that


what
 I
 was
 looking
 like.
 Even
 if
 you
 put


Gatorade
 zero
 like
 you
 gota
 got
 to
 say


zero
 what?
 Zero
 calorie.
 That
 is
 what
 we


got.
 Zero
 calorie
 mocktail.
 Your


questions
 are
 gay.


All right.
 That's
 what
 we
 got.


That
 is
 uh


that
 is
 what
 we
 got
 right
 there.
 All


right.
 Cool.
 So
 um
 those
 were
 the
 first


two
 questions.
 again,
 please
 make
 sure


to
 message
 me


and
 we'll
 try
 to
 get
 some
 of
 that
 out


there.


All
 right,
 next
 question.


Next
 question.


Okay,
 so


uh
 pulling
 up
 something
 real
 quick
 to


see.


This
 is
 actually
 a
 good
 one.
 I
 think


this
 is
 actually
 recent,
 too.
 It's


actually
 recent.
 Okay.
 So,
 let's
 do


Yeah.


Okay.
 So,
 there's
 three
 responses
 to


this.
 You
 got
 to
 get
 all
 three
 to
 be


right.
 Okay.
 You
 got
 to
 get
 all
 three
 to


be
 right.
 This
 is
 uh
 this
 is
 this
 is


giving
 my
 my
 my
 Twitter
 audience,
 anyone


who
 follows
 on
 X,
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 of
 an


edge
 here.
 Okay.
 So,
 it's
 got
 to
 be


three,
 preferably
 separated
 by
 a
 comma.


It's
 okay
 if
 it's
 not,
 but
 three
 in
 one


answer.
 What
 are
 the
 three
 tickers
 for


the
 stocks
 that
 I
 have
 done
 an
 equity


edge
 episode
 on
 on
 Xpaces?
 What
 are
 the


three
 tickers
 for
 the
 stocks
 that
 I've


done
 an
 equity
 edge
 episode
 on


for
 X
 spaces?


Three
 tickers.


It's
 not
 pounder
 hood
 and
 grab.
 Thought


it
 was
 gonna
 be
 that
 easy.
 Pound
 your


hood
 and
 grab.


I
 got
 to
 see
 all
 three
 together.


All
 three
 together.
 Equity
 edge.
 See


Davis,
 you
 don't
 know
 about
 it
 because


you
 don't
 you
 don't
 pay
 attention
 on


Twitter.
 That's
 that's
 your
 problem.


This
 guy
 wants
 to
 say
 happy
 birthday,


post
 all
 these
 pictures
 of
 me.
 He


doesn't
 even
 listen
 to
 my
 show.
 Aerof


Floyd,
 I
 think
 you
 got
 it.
 Aerof
 Floyd,


it's
 AMKR,
 GXO,
 and
 ENS.


Did
 anyone
 have
 it
 before
 you?
 I
 really


don't
 think
 anyone
 did.


Nope,
 it's
 you.
 AFloyd,
 AMKR,
 GXO,
 and


ENS.


Yep,
 there
 you
 go.
 All right,
 Aerof


Floyd,
 please
 message
 me.
 AER
 O
 Floyd,


you
 are
 the
 winner
 of
 the
 third


giveaway.


Okay.
 Boom.
 Yeah,
 th
 those
 R&D
 tickers,


AMKR,
 ENS,
 and
 GXO
 are
 three
 tickers.


They're
 not
 the
 most
 well-known
 tickers,


but
 nonetheless,
 they
 they
 are
 still


tickers.


All
 right.
 So,


that's
 what
 we
 got.


Um,


next
 question.


Next,
 next
 question.


And
 again,
 guys,
 for
 some
 of
 you
 that


have
 it
 on
 your
 screen
 first,
 I
 mean,


this
 is
 the
 best
 way
 I
 have
 of
 doing
 a


giveaway
 right
 now.
 The
 problem
 is


there's
 thousands
 of
 you.
 So,
 if
 we
 use


some
 thirdparty
 platform,
 it's
 just
 not


the
 easiest
 to
 get
 everyone
 to
 engage.


And
 so,
 YouTube
 is
 the
 easiest
 way
 of


it.
 But
 we'll
 try
 to
 do
 as
 many


giveaways
 as
 we
 can
 to


to
 try
 to
 set
 this
 up.


Okay,
 next
 question.
 Next
 question.
 We


did
 three
 of
 them,
 right?
 Okay,
 so
 we


got
 three
 of
 them
 in.


Next
 question.


Okay,
 so


let's
 do
 this
 one.


Um,


I
 asked
 this
 question
 before,
 but
 I
 feel


like
 it's
 such
 a
 good
 one
 because
 it


goes
 back
 to


It
 goes
 back
 to
 like
 the
 OG
 days
 of
 of


the
 channel.
 And


okay,
 so
 I'm
 gonna
 ask
 the
 question


again.
 It
 will
 be
 an
 advantage
 for
 some


of
 you
 that
 have
 heard
 the
 question


before,
 a
 disadvantage
 for
 those
 that


haven't,
 but
 if
 you've
 been
 part
 of
 the


streams
 for
 a
 while,
 you're
 definitely


only
 going
 to
 know
 this
 if
 you've
 been


listening.


And
 this
 was
 a
 hard
 question
 last
 time,


so
 I
 think
 it's
 and
 no,
 it's
 not
 blue


wall.
 It's
 not
 what's
 the
 color
 of
 my


background
 from
 the
 old
 videos.


How
 do
 I
 word
 it?
 It's
 um


Okay,
 I
 think
 I
 got
 it.
 Okay,
 cool.
 Got


it.
 All right,
 so
 this
 is
 actually


pretty
 simple
 for
 those
 that
 have
 been


keeping
 up
 for
 a
 while.
 Might
 be
 a


little
 harder
 for
 others.
 So,
 this
 for


the
 OG's.
 All right.


What
 was
 the
 stock


that


Chris
 Patel
 went
 long
 on
 in
 the
 healthc


care
 sector
 that
 Gary
 Black
 hated?
 What


was
 the
 stock
 that
 Chris
 Patel
 went
 long


on
 in
 the
 healthc
 care
 sector
 that
 Gary


Black
 hated?
 This
 was
 back
 in
 2023.


This
 was
 back
 in
 2023.


What
 was
 the
 stock
 Chris
 Patel
 went
 long


on
 that
 Gary
 Black?
 He's
 the
 guy
 who's


like
 always
 bearish
 Tesla
 hated.
 Chris


Patel
 called
 him
 an
 idiot
 on
 the
 stream


the
 day
 that
 his
 uh
 his
 bear
 thesis
 came


out


and
 it
 is
 in
 the
 healthc
 care
 sector.


Wow.
 No
 one
 has
 it
 yet.
 No
 one
 freaking


has.
 It's
 been
 Oh,
 I
 think
 someone
 got


it.
 I
 think
 someone
 got
 it
 and
 I


recognized
 their
 name.
 So,
 they
 probably


were
 there
 in
 the
 early
 days.
 Let
 me


just
 confirm.


Let
 me
 just
 confirm
 you
 got
 it.
 It's
 the


guy.
 It's
 not
 UNH.
 That
 was
 two
 years


ago.
 UNH
 is
 now
 like
 Chris
 likes
 it.
 All


right.
 I
 think
 you
 got
 it.
 Let
 me
 fully


make
 sure.


Yeah.
 Okay.
 James
 Veles.
 It
 was
 Weight


Watchers.
 It
 was
 Weight
 Watchers.


Chris
 went
 long
 the
 day
 it
 came
 out.
 Or


not
 the
 day
 it
 came
 out,
 but
 like
 the


day
 uh
 Gary
 Black's
 Bear
 Thesis
 came


out.
 James
 Vez,
 you
 are
 the
 winner.


And
 the
 answer
 was
 Weight
 Watchers.
 I


think
 James,
 I
 recognize
 you've
 been


listening
 for
 a
 long
 time


on
 the
 show.
 This
 was
 back
 in
 the


finance
 junky
 days.
 That's
 when
 Chris


Vitali,
 Carlos,
 and
 I
 did
 a
 podcast.


Yeah,
 this
 was
 kind
 of
 hard
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people,
 but
 James
 Bles,
 you
 got
 it.


Where's
 Weight
 Watchers
 today?
 Weight


Watcher
 stock.


Okay,
 they
 definitely
 did
 a
 reverse


split.
 Did
 they?
 I
 feel
 like
 they
 did
 a


reverse
 split.
 32.97.
 It's
 actually
 up


22%
 this
 year.


And
 so
 that
 one
 is
 green.
 James
 Vez,
 you


got
 it.
 So,
 please
 email
 me
 and
 uh
 let


me
 know
 what
 you
 got.
 All
 right.
 Cool.


There
 you
 go.
 There
 you
 go.


Um


Okay,
 cool.
 Next
 question.


Next
 question
 for
 what
 we
 got.
 I


remember
 Chris
 talking
 about
 Weight


Watchers.
 Yeah,
 he
 was
 he
 was
 deep
 into


that
 one
 back
 then.


He
 made
 some
 good
 money
 on
 it.
 I
 mean,


he
 he
 did
 some
 spreads
 on
 it,
 made
 some


money,
 and
 then
 he
 kind
 of
 kind
 of
 moved


on.
 Okay,
 here's
 a


Well,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 this
 is
 the
 best


one.


Amcor
 is
 down
 4%.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 they're


having
 their
 call
 right
 now,
 so
 they


could
 be
 saying
 something
 that's
 causing


the
 stock
 to
 drop.
 Look,
 the
 earnings


were
 really
 good.
 So,
 the
 stock
 I
 mean,


I'm
 less
 confirmed
 with
 the
 stock.
 stock


was
 up
 at
 3489
 at
 one
 point.
 Now
 it's


down
 at
 31.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 been


oscillating
 between
 30
 and
 34
 basically


for
 the
 past
 two
 months
 now.
 So,
 the
 CEO


is
 retiring.
 That's
 always
 a
 reason
 why


stocks
 tend
 to
 take
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


dip.
 But
 the
 earnings
 themselves,
 I


mean,
 based
 on
 the
 results,
 I
 was
 the


best
 quarter
 they've
 ever
 had
 in
 history


of
 two
 billion
 in
 revenue.
 So,
 I'll
 go


through
 the
 uh
 earnings
 transcript


tonight.
 We'll
 see
 what
 they
 have
 to


say,
 but
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 broader
 trend


should
 be
 intact
 for
 Ramort.


Okay,
 cool.


Next
 question.
 We
 did
 We
 did
 four,


right?
 We
 did
 four.
 Yeah.
 Okay.


Uh,
 this
 is
 actually
 Okay,
 this
 is


actually
 a
 good
 one.
 It's
 It's
 super


specific,
 but
 it's
 also
 super
 easy.


Okay,
 so
 this
 one's
 super
 specific,
 but


also
 super
 easy,
 and
 anyone
 can
 guess


and
 get
 the
 next
 one
 right.
 Like,
 legit,


you
 can
 take
 a
 guess
 and
 get
 it
 right.


But
 if
 you
 remember
 me
 talking
 about


this,
 which
 I've
 talked
 about
 several


times,
 you
 will
 immediately
 know
 and
 you


will
 type
 in
 the
 answer.
 But
 you
 could


also
 guess
 and
 probably
 be
 right.
 Okay.


Arie
 and
 I
 back
 when
 Pounder
 was
 910


bucks
 had
 multiple
 conversations
 late
 at


night
 because
 he's
 in
 Italy.
 I'm
 in


Jersey
 about
 what
 life
 would
 be
 like
 if


pounder
 was
 not
 or
 $10.


And
 we
 would
 stay
 up,
 you
 know,
 for
 him


till
 4:00
 a.m.,
 for
 me
 till
 like
 12:00


a.m.
 just
 talking
 about
 like
 sticking
 to


the
 plan
 and
 the
 mission
 and
 how
 we


would
 analyze
 the
 company,
 all
 this


stuff.
 And,
 you
 know,
 our
 hopes
 and


dreams
 of
 one
 day
 when
 the
 world


recognizes
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 Palier.


Here's
 the
 question.


What
 was
 the
 video
 platform
 we
 used
 to


talk
 late
 at
 night
 during
 those
 years?


What
 was
 the
 video
 platform
 we
 used
 to


talk
 late
 at
 night
 during
 those
 years?


I've
 said
 this
 multiple
 times.


KD5442.


You
 got
 it.
 Zoom.


That's
 what
 I'm
 saying.
 This
 was
 easy,


right?
 It's
 like
 Zoom.
 It's
 like
 what


else?
 It's
 freaking
 Zoom.
 That's
 what


you
 use.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 KD
 if
 you've


heard
 me
 talk
 about
 us.
 I
 would
 always


say
 we
 had
 these
 Zoom
 calls
 late
 at


night
 or
 if
 you
 just
 guess
 Zoom,
 but


nonetheless,
 you're
 right.
 KD5442.


Zoom
 is
 correct.
 That
 is
 the
 video


platform
 I
 used.


It
 was
 super
 specific,
 but
 also
 super


like
 you
 could
 guess
 and
 still
 get
 it


right
 to
 have
 these
 phone
 calls.


And
 now
 Josh
 Brown
 is
 long
 Zoom.
 So,


we're
 going to
 see
 on
 their
 earnings


what
 they
 put
 up.
 Zoom
 is
 up
 1%
 today,


up
 4%.
 For
 the
 year,


dude,
 whoever
 said
 Skype


and
 we've
 been
 living
 under
 a
 rock.
 Is


Skype
 even
 allowed
 or
 even
 even
 like


Microsoft
 bought
 them
 for
 like
 eight


billion
 and
 then
 shut
 them
 down
 a
 while


ago?


Skype's
 an
 old
 one.
 Skype
 is
 an
 old
 one.


Okay,
 cool.
 Next.
 Um,
 what
 do
 we
 got?


Okay,
 some
 of
 these
 some
 of
 these


guesses
 are
 kind
 of
 crazy.
 Um,


but
 yeah,
 it
 was
 not
 Skype.
 Was
 not


Skype.


Okay,
 next
 one.
 What
 do
 we
 got?
 Um,


let's
 do


let's
 do
 this
 question.
 I
 think


I
 think
 this
 should
 be
 a
 decent
 one.


This
 should
 not
 be
 horrible.


It
 should
 give
 an
 an
 even
 chance
 to
 most


people.
 I
 think
 I
 said
 this
 a
 while
 ago.


Most
 people
 know
 this
 anyway.


Um,


we
 should
 do
 a
 stock
 market
 one
 though.


Yeah.
 Okay,
 we
 should
 do
 a
 stock
 market


one.
 Let
 me
 let
 me
 pull
 this
 up
 real


quick.
 Let
 me
 just
 make
 sure.


Yeah,
 this
 one
 I
 actually
 wanted
 to
 do.


This
 one
 will
 be
 a
 good
 one.


Let
 me
 make
 sure


I
 can
 pull
 it
 up
 right
 here.


Um,


let's
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.


Okay,
 this
 is
 going to
 be
 a
 stock
 one.


This
 is
 actually
 going
 to
 be
 an


important
 one.
 It
 goes
 back
 a
 few
 years,


but
 it
 does


matter.


Um,


let's
 see
 if
 I
 can
 make
 sure
 this
 is


confirmed.
 I
 just
 want
 to
 get
 the
 number


exactly
 right
 so
 that


I
 can
 pull
 this
 up.


This
 was
 back
 in
 I'll
 give
 you
 guys
 the


year.
 This
 was
 back
 in
 2022.


back
 in
 2022.
 Okay,
 cool.
 So,
 here
 you


go.


Here
 you
 go.
 All right,
 here
 it
 is.


Okay,
 simple
 question.
 Anyone
 can
 find


this,
 but
 this
 is
 also
 an
 important


question
 I
 think
 in
 general.
 So


there
 was
 a
 quarter
 for
 Palunteer


where


um


there
 was
 a
 quarter
 for
 Palunteer.


Okay.
 There
 was
 a
 quarter
 for
 pound


share
 where
 Alex
 Karp


banged
 the
 table
 because
 he
 was
 so
 upset


about
 how
 the
 company
 was
 progressing.


That
 was
 Q2


2022.
 What
 was
 Palanteer's
 revenue


growth?
 Q2
 2022
 year-over-year.
 What
 was


their
 revenue
 growth?


Q2
 2022.


What
 was
 Palenters's
 revenue
 growth
 that


caused
 Karp
 to
 get
 mad
 enough
 to
 bang


the
 table?


Oh,
 Justin
 Hunter
 got
 it.
 Justin
 Hunter


got
 it.


Justin
 Hunter
 got
 it.
 26%.


26%.


There
 you
 go.
 Justin
 Hunter,
 you
 got
 it.


Q2
 2022
 for
 pounder.
 This
 is
 actually


not
 a
 horrible
 quarter.
 It
 was
 just
 one


of
 those
 quarters
 where
 Karp
 was
 so


pissed
 off
 because
 the
 analysts
 didn't


get
 it.
 They
 weren't
 profitable.
 Revenue


growth
 was
 relatively
 decent,
 but
 still


not
 enough
 to
 get
 the
 street
 to
 be


excited.
 26%
 Tesla
 says
 those
 three


years
 went
 quick
 as
 hell.
 I
 mean,
 dude,


now
 you
 know
 we're
 talking
 about


revenues
 of
 50%.


But
 yes,
 26%.
 Justin
 Hunter,
 you
 got


that
 right.


Let
 me
 know.
 You
 can
 email
 me
 as
 well.


Okay,
 we
 did
 we
 did
 six
 of
 them,
 right?


We
 have
 four
 left.


Yeah.
 Okay,
 we
 have
 four
 left.
 Cool.


Four
 left.


It
 was
 25.8
 guy.
 It
 was
 26,
 but
 I'm


looking
 at
 their
 their
 their
 website


right
 now.
 It
 was
 26.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 by


what
 poundter
 said
 26%
 year-over-year.


That
 was
 the
 revenue
 that
 they
 have.
 All


right.
 Um,
 let's
 do
 another
 stock


question.
 Let's
 do
 another
 stock
 one.
 I


think
 this
 will
 be
 fun.
 Um,
 let's
 go
 to


let's
 go
 to


I
 mean
 this
 one
 actually
 I
 think
 this
 is


a
 this
 is
 a
 decent
 one.
 This
 should
 be


pretty
 decent.
 Um,
 let
 me
 confirm
 the


numbers
 right
 here.


Let's
 pull
 this
 up.


Okay.
 So,


let's
 do
 this
 one.


I
 mean,
 I
 feel
 like
 this
 one's
 Oh,
 yeah.


Well,
 this
 one's
 pretty
 simple.
 This


one's
 pretty
 simple.
 I
 mean,


this
 one's
 actually
 really
 simple.


Okay,
 cool.
 Here
 we
 go.
 This
 should
 be


super
 easy,
 even
 if
 you
 just
 guess
 on


it.
 But
 uh
 I
 do
 think
 this
 one's
 not


going
 to
 be
 that
 hard.
 All right,
 here


we
 go.
 3
 2
 1.
 How
 many
 times
 did
 the
 Fed


cut
 in
 2024?
 How
 many
 times
 did
 the
 Fed


cut
 in
 2024?


How
 many
 times
 did
 the
 Fed
 Oh,
 I
 got
 it.


Cheese
 Head.


Cheese
 Head,
 you
 are
 the
 winner.
 On
 my


screen,
 the
 answer
 is
 three.
 Cheese


Head,
 you
 are
 number
 three.


The
 amount
 of
 you
 guys
 spamming
 Grinder


thinking
 that
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 an


answer
 is
 incredible.
 But
 Cheese
 Head,


you
 are
 the
 first
 one
 to
 get
 it.
 Number


three
 is
 the
 answer.


Number
 three.


Three
 Fed
 cuts
 back.
 That
 was
 really


easy.
 That
 was
 an
 easy
 one,
 but
 that


should
 have
 given
 everyone
 a
 decent


chance.
 You
 somewhat
 paid
 attention
 last


year
 about
 just
 like
 Fed
 policy.
 Then


2024,
 three
 Fed
 cuts.


All
 right,
 let's
 do
 a
 juicy
 one
 now.


Let's
 do
 a
 juicy
 one.
 Oh,
 we
 got
 to
 get


through
 all
 the
 super
 chats,
 too.
 Holy


Okay,
 we
 we
 still
 got
 some
 work
 to
 do


before
 we
 get
 out
 of
 here.
 Um,


okay.
 Let's
 do
 let's
 do
 a
 juicy
 one.
 I


was
 thinking
 of
 these
 throughout
 the


entire
 day.
 I
 didn't
 get
 to
 a
 bunch
 of


them.
 I
 was
 thinking
 of
 a
 few
 that
 I


had,
 but
 I'm
 not
 sure
 if
 those
 are
 the


best
 ones.
 Um,


let's
 do


more
 questions
 about
 the
 dentist.
 Let's


do
 uh,
 you
 know,
 actually
 this
 one
 is


not


this
 one
 is
 not
 horrible.


This
 should
 be
 another


another
 one
 for
 the
 channel
 in
 general.


High
 School
 Musical
 is
 too
 easy,
 bro.
 If


I
 said
 my
 favorite
 movie,
 which
 is
 not


High
 School
 Musical,
 okay,
 it's


Inception,
 but
 HSM
 is
 up
 there
 top
 five.


Also,
 I
 was
 watching
 Steve
 doing
 this
 S


tier
 movie
 ranking.
 Dude,
 that
 guy
 does


not
 know
 how
 to
 rank
 movies.
 He
 was
 like


I
 told
 him
 I
 could
 never
 do
 this
 with


him
 because
 like
 he
 doesn't
 understand


movies
 as
 well,
 but
 he
 tried
 he
 tried
 to


rank
 them
 the
 best
 he
 could.
 Just
 feel


like
 he
 needs
 to
 watch
 some
 more
 movies


to
 to
 really
 have
 an
 opinion
 on
 this


stuff.
 Um,
 okay.
 So,


let's
 do


Okay,
 Dark
 Knight's
 top
 five.
 I
 don't


know if
 it
 beats
 The
 Inception.
 The


Inception.
 Inception.
 I
 don't
 know if
 it


beats
 Inception,
 but
 Dark
 Knight
 is


still
 still
 up
 there
 for
 me.
 Um,


wow.
 This
 is
 actually


This
 is
 actually


This
 is
 actually
 not
 too
 bad.
 It's
 an
 OG


one.
 It's
 an
 OG.
 Okay,
 this
 is
 not


juicy.
 This
 is
 just
 an
 OG
 one.
 We
 We'll


We'll
 We'll
 leave
 two
 juicy
 ones
 for
 the


end.
 This
 is
 an
 OG
 one.
 All right,
 you


guys
 ready?


What
 was
 the
 name


of
 the
 battery
 company
 that
 Carlos
 and


Vitali
 were
 big
 fans
 of?
 What
 was
 the


name
 of
 the
 battery
 company
 ticker
 or


the
 name
 itself
 that
 Carlos
 and
 Vitali


were
 big
 fans
 of?
 You
 guys
 are
 really


saying
 Duracell,
 bro.
 No,
 it's
 not


Duracell.


Mikuel
 Carlson.
 Got
 it.
 Anovix.
 It
 was


Anovix.
 Envx.


We
 talked
 about
 that
 stock
 for
 a
 long


time
 on
 Finance
 Junkies.
 I
 mean,
 these


guys
 really
 did
 love
 that
 stock,
 and


it's
 it's
 had
 a
 pretty
 good
 couple


years.
 Um,
 but
 TJ
 Rogers
 was
 one
 of
 the


main
 influences
 for
 why
 they
 liked
 it.


Michael
 or
 Mikuel
 Carlson
 1531,
 you
 are


the
 winner,
 sir.
 Please
 make
 sure
 to


email
 me
 and
 we
 will
 get
 you
 the
 Amazon


gift
 card.


Nphase
 is
 not
 really
 a
 battery
 company.


Nphase
 is
 more
 micro
 inverters,
 but
 yes,


they
 also
 did
 like
 Nphase
 as
 well.


This
 giveaway
 is
 rigged.
 How
 is
 it


rigged,
 bro?
 How
 is
 it?


I
 gave
 Mikuel
 the
 questions
 beforehand.


Although,
 you
 know,
 you
 should
 be


skeptical
 because
 given
 what's
 going
 on


with
 the
 NBA,
 you
 should
 be
 skeptical
 of


what's
 going
 on.


Okay,
 last
 two.
 Last
 two
 should
 be


juicy.


Last
 two
 should
 be


relatively
 juicy.
 Let's
 see
 what
 we
 can


do.


He's


gonna
 sell
 your
 personal
 data.
 Um,


I'm
 trying
 to
 think
 of
 just
 the
 channel


and
 the
 inside
 jokes
 on
 the
 channel
 over


the
 past
 couple
 years.


And
 I'm
 trying
 to
 think
 what
 would
 be


something
 that
 I've
 been
 watching
 for
 a


while.
 You
 probably
 know.
 Oh,
 this
 is
 a


good
 Oh,
 this
 is
 a
 good
 one.
 This
 is
 a


good
 All right,
 here
 we
 go.
 This
 is
 a


good
 one.
 This
 is
 a
 good
 one.
 Here
 we


go,
 guys.
 Ready?


I
 used
 to
 wear
 a
 black
 hat.
 I
 wore
 it


until
 that
 hat
 literally
 was
 falling


apart.
 What
 was
 the
 name
 of
 the
 company


on
 that
 hat?
 What
 was
 the
 name
 of
 the


company
 on
 that
 hat?


It's
 not
 Palanteer.
 Someone's
 going
 to


get
 it.
 This
 is
 a
 hard
 one,
 but
 it's
 a


good
 one.
 This
 is
 a
 hard
 one.
 It's
 not


SoFi.
 It's
 not
 Nike.
 It's
 not
 Lakers.


This
 is
 You
 had
 to
 watch
 back
 in
 22
 23


to
 really
 And
 I
 wore
 this
 hat
 a
 million


times.
 So,
 if
 you've
 watched
 those


videos,
 you
 you
 you
 saw
 this
 hat
 like


every
 day.


No
 one's
 got
 it
 yet.
 No
 one's
 got
 it.


I
 love
 this.
 This
 is
 such
 a
 good


question.
 Someone's
 going
 to
 get
 it


eventually.


Someone's
 gonna
 get
 it.


Dude,
 this
 is
 great.
 No
 one's
 got
 it.


It's
 not
 Ruckers.
 It's
 not
 the
 Suns.


It's
 not
 a
 sports
 team.
 I
 literally


said,
 "What's
 the
 name
 of
 the
 company


that
 was
 on
 the
 hat?


Dude,
 none
 of
 you
 guys
 got
 it.
 This
 is
 a


good
 one.
 Does
 no
 one
 get
 this
 one?
 Do


does
 this
 one
 always
 stay
 a
 mystery?


Okay,
 I'll
 give
 you
 guys
 another
 hand.


The
 company
 is
 not
 public
 anymore.
 They


got
 delisted,


unfortunately.
 Does
 that
 Does
 that
 ring


a
 bell?


Does
 that
 ring
 a
 bell?
 They
 got


delisted.


Okay,
 now
 no
 one
 should
 be
 saying


pounder
 or
 anything
 like
 because
 Calvin


Klein
 got
 delisted,
 did
 they?
 It's
 not


Calvin
 Klein,


dude.
 No
 one
 got
 it.
 No,
 Calvin
 Klein
 is


owned
 by
 PBH.


Damn.
 No
 one
 got
 it.
 All
 right.
 I
 Oh,


our
 boy.
 Well,


Matt,
 you
 got
 it,
 but
 you
 spelled
 it


wrong.
 But
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 should
 still


give
 it
 to
 you
 because
 I
 I
 know
 what


you're
 trying
 to
 say.
 I
 know
 what
 Matt's


trying
 to
 say.


Matt,
 you
 got
 it,
 but
 you
 spelled
 it


wrong.


But
 I
 know
 what
 you're
 trying
 to
 say.


I
 think
 we
 just
 give
 it
 to
 Matt.
 I
 think


we
 just
 give
 it
 to
 Matt.


He's
 the
 only
 one
 that
 spelled
 it
 right.


Dude,
 of
 you
 guys
 are
 still
 spelling
 it


right.
 All right.
 Did
 we
 give
 that
 to


Matt?


Did
 we
 give
 that
 to
 Matt?
 This
 one
 was
 a


hard
 one,
 but
 I
 think
 we
 gave
 it
 to


Matt.


I
 think
 we
 give
 it
 to
 Matt.
 I
 think
 we


gave
 it
 to
 him.


Matt
 was
 the
 only
 one
 who
 got
 it
 first.


Okay,
 we're
 going
 to
 give
 it
 to
 Matt
 and


we're
 going to
 give
 it
 to
 the
 next


person
 I
 see
 who
 spelled
 it
 correctly.


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 say
 it
 yet.
 Let
 me


scroll
 through.
 Matt
 got
 it.
 He
 messed


up
 one
 letter,
 but
 there's
 got
 to
 be


someone
 underneath
 him
 who
 got
 it


correct.


Uh,
 the
 first
 person
 who
 I
 see
 under


Matt
 that
 actually
 got
 it.


Oh,
 dude,
 the
 name
 just
 disappeared.
 You


guys
 are
 typing
 so
 fast
 now.
 Now


everyone
 has
 it's
 Ouija
 Joe.
 It's
 Ouija.


We wo.


Okay,
 I'm
 just
 going to
 give
 that
 to


Matt.
 Matt
 got
 it.
 Matt
 got
 it.
 Matt


Matt
 typed
 web,
 but
 we
 all
 we
 all
 knew


what
 Matt
 Matt
 Matt
 definitely
 knows


this
 company
 because
 that
 was
 a
 pounder


spack.
 That's
 why
 I
 had
 their
 hat.
 And


uh
 unfortunately
 these
 guys
 got
 unlisted


from
 the
 stock
 exchange.
 But


all right,
 Matt,
 we
 gave
 it
 to
 you.


We
 gave
 it
 to
 you.


See,
 this
 is
 a
 good
 qu
 dude.
 None
 of
 you


guys
 knew
 this
 question.
 Ouija,
 you
 had


to
 be
 watching
 intently
 back
 then.


Maybe
 we'll
 do
 another
 question
 to
 make


up
 for
 that
 one.
 But
 Matt,
 for
 sure,


I'll
 make
 sure
 you
 get
 a
 gift
 card
 as


well.
 And
 uh
 there
 you
 go.
 The
 answer


was
 Ouija.
 They
 gave
 me
 a
 hat
 because
 I


went
 to
 one
 of
 their
 events.
 They
 were


pounders
 back
 and
 then,
 you
 know,
 they


were
 just
 one
 of
 those
 facts
 that
 was


not
 meant
 to
 go
 public.
 And


unfortunately,
 they
 ended
 up,
 you
 know,


getting
 hit.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 forgot


about
 them,
 but
 Ouija
 I
 actually


interviewed
 their
 CEO
 while
 a
 while
 ago,


but
 Ouija
 was
 uh
 what
 was
 the
 company?


Okay,
 cool.
 Um,


my
 gift
 can
 be
 gifting
 it
 to
 someone.


I'll
 think
 of
 a
 question.
 All
 right,


Matt,
 if
 you
 got
 one,
 message
 me
 on


WhatsApp
 if
 you
 have
 a
 good
 question.


And
 that
 was
 a
 good
 one,
 but
 maybe
 that


was
 too
 hard,
 but
 still
 wasn't
 too
 bad,


I
 think.


Okay,
 cool.
 Um,
 let's
 do
 another
 one.


So,
 let's
 do
 SoFi
 3047.
 Are
 we
 really


moving
 after
 hours
 on
 SoFi?


Dude,
 I
 like
 that
 it's
 pumping.
 I'm
 also


a
 little
 scared
 that
 maybe
 it's
 making


too
 much
 of
 a
 run
 before
 earnings.
 Then


again,
 earnings
 are
 tomorrow.
 If
 this


one's
 going
 to
 explode,
 then
 maybe
 it


starts
 right
 now.


Maybe
 it
 starts
 right
 now.
 Look
 at
 that.


SoFi
 S&P
 also
 still
 moving
 after
 hours


as
 well.
 Admitted,
 you're
 halfway
 to
 56.


Exactly.


Halfway
 to
 freaking
 56.


Okay.
 Um,


let's
 do


Oh,
 this
 is
 a
 good
 one.
 This
 is
 a
 good


one.
 Matt,
 thank
 you.
 This
 is
 great.


This
 one's
 not
 too
 hard
 either.
 Oh,


shout
 out
 to
 Matt
 money.
 This
 is
 a
 good


one.
 All right,
 here
 we
 go.


Very
 simple.
 Uh,
 I'm
 looking
 for
 a
 word


on
 this
 that's
 specific.
 I'm
 looking
 a


word
 on
 this
 that's
 specific.
 There


could
 be
 multiple
 ways
 to
 answer
 this


question,
 but
 I'm
 looking
 on
 a
 word


that's
 very
 specific.
 I
 It
 shouldn't
 be


so
 specific
 that
 it's
 hard
 to
 guess.
 It


should
 be
 a
 very
 easy
 word.
 Okay.


The
 time
 is
 now.
 Gay.
 Oh
 my
 goodness.


All right.
 What
 kind
 of
 store
 did
 my
 dad


own
 growing
 up?
 What
 kind
 of
 store
 did


my
 dad
 own
 growing
 up?


Very
 simple
 answer
 to
 this.


Okay,
 Cheese
 Head,
 you
 got
 it.
 But
 I
 got


to
 give
 it
 to
 someone
 else
 because


you've
 already
 you've
 already
 won
 a


giveaway.
 Uh,
 Dair
 86,
 you
 got
 it.


D
 I
 Eure
 86.
 You
 got
 it.
 Liquor
 store.


That
 is
 correct.
 Liquor
 store.


Davis
 says
 hotel.
 Davis.
 That's
 why


you're
 racist.
 Okay.
 No,
 it's
 not
 a


hotel.
 Okay.
 We're
 not
 just
 We're
 not


We're
 not
 like
 every
 patale
 that's
 out


there.
 Liquor
 store
 is
 the
 answer.
 Die.


Sure.
 86.
 Tezed.
 You
 were
 two
 for
 two,


bro.
 But
 you
 got
 to
 spread
 a
 little
 bit


of
 love
 to
 some
 of
 the
 other
 people.
 So


die
 sure
 86.
 You
 got
 it.
 Liquor
 store
 is


the
 answer.


It's
 kind
 of
 crazy
 because
 I
 don't
 know


how
 to
 drink.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 drink,


but
 my
 dad
 owned
 a
 liquor
 store.
 I


literally
 walked
 past
 the
 liquor
 and
 the


beer
 and
 the
 whiskey
 every
 day
 because
 I


was
 bored
 when
 I
 would
 come
 back
 from


this
 was
 middle
 school
 and
 I
 had
 to
 wait


till
 my
 mom
 would
 pick
 me
 up.
 So
 I'd
 be


there
 for
 a
 legit
 two
 hours
 every
 day


just
 sitting
 there.
 And
 then
 I,
 you


know,
 honestly,
 part
 of
 my
 yapping


capabilities,
 I
 think,
 came
 from
 me


walking
 through
 the
 aisles
 of
 the
 liquor


store
 and
 just
 like
 imagining
 different


scenarios
 and
 I
 would
 like
 paint
 these


stories
 in
 my
 head
 and
 because
 I
 needed


to
 entertain
 myself
 because
 there
 was


like
 I
 had
 no
 smartphone
 or
 anything
 and


I'd
 just
 be
 bored
 and
 I'd
 legit
 just


like
 walk
 through
 and
 think
 about
 idea.


Maybe
 that
 was
 the
 beginning
 of
 my


imagination
 and
 like
 the
 ability
 to
 keep


talking.
 But,
 uh,
 it
 was
 a
 liquor
 store.


It
 was
 it
 was
 in
 front
 of
 Jack
 Daniels


and
 Jagger
 and


freaking
 Heineken
 all
 of
 that
 stuff.
 I


would
 I
 would
 sometimes
 stock
 the
 liquor


the
 beers
 in
 the
 back
 and
 go
 to
 the


fridge
 and
 like
 read
 like
 I
 would
 you


know
 so
 I've
 been
 around
 alcohol
 for
 so


long
 but
 I
 suck
 at
 drinking
 it.


He
 sold
 the
 store
 in
 2011.
 So
 he
 didn't


give
 me
 a
 discount
 for
 my
 party
 because


he
 sold
 it
 back
 in
 2011.
 You
 know,
 quite


frankly,
 just
 to
 be
 honest,
 the
 business


was
 not
 that
 successful.
 Um,
 we
 had
 some


bad
 loans
 on
 the
 business.
 My
 dad
 was
 a


bit
 indecisive.
 We
 could
 have
 got
 double


the
 offer
 if
 he
 had
 sold
 five
 years


earlier,
 but
 then
 the
 recession
 happened


and
 so
 he
 had
 to
 take
 a
 crappy
 offer.


So,
 he
 was
 just
 happy
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 it,


but
 we
 really
 didn't
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 money


off
 the
 sale
 of
 that
 liquor
 store.
 And


the
 hours
 were
 grueling
 because
 he
 would


leave
 at
 like
 7
 a.m.,
 be
 back
 at
 11
 p.m.


every
 night.
 So
 I
 didn't
 see
 my
 dad
 the


whole
 day,
 you
 know.
 So
 definitely
 not


the
 but
 again
 it's
 like
 you
 know


immigrants
 American
 dream.
 You
 got
 to


put
 food
 on
 the
 table.
 You
 got
 to
 do


whatever
 you
 can
 do
 and
 that
 was
 his
 way


of
 uh
 you
 know
 uh
 serving
 the
 family.


But
 yeah
 wasn't
 exactly
 the
 best


business.
 Also
 my
 my
 grandpa
 used
 to
 run


it.
 My
 grandpa
 got
 shot
 once
 cuz
 someone


came
 and
 asked
 for
 the
 money.
 And
 my


grandpa
 who
 doesn't
 speak
 English
 he
 was


like
 screw
 you.
 I'm
 not
 giving
 you
 the


money.
 And
 the
 dude
 was
 like,
 "All


right,
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 shoot
 you
 and


take
 the
 money."
 So,
 it's
 like,
 you


know,
 it's
 like
 it's
 not
 the
 best


business
 in
 the
 world
 to
 be
 part
 of.


Thankfully,
 grandpa
 survived
 after
 that.


But


yeah,
 definitely
 definitely
 a
 bit
 more


risky.
 Okay,
 so
 last
 question.
 Last


question.
 Again,
 please
 make
 sure
 to


email
 it
 is
 a
 mituk
 rage
 atgmail.
 That


is
 the
 email
 for
 all
 the
 winners.


Um,


someone
 actually
 won
 $30,000
 on
 the


lottery
 ticket
 that
 my
 dad
 sold
 back
 in


like
 2009
 or
 2010.
 And
 I
 think
 the


liquor
 store
 that
 sells
 it
 gets
 like
 a


very
 small
 percentage
 of
 that.
 So
 I


think
 he
 got
 like
 $700
 for
 selling
 a


$30,000
 ticket.
 But
 I
 do
 remember
 that


day
 because
 like
 the
 store
 had
 sold,
 you


know,
 ticket
 that
 actually
 gave
 someone


30
 grand.


Okay,
 last
 question.
 That
 was
 a
 great


question
 by
 Matt.
 Matt,
 thank
 you
 for


that.
 That
 was
 awesome.
 That
 was
 a
 great


question
 by
 Matt.


Um,


okay.
 So,
 last
 one.
 Are
 you
 selling
 SoFi


tomorrow
 or
 after
 the
 rate
 cut?
 I
 want


to
 see
 the
 quarter,
 dude.
 I
 want
 to
 see


it.
 I
 think
 if
 it's
 a
 good
 quarter,
 I'm


not
 interested
 in
 selling.
 If
 it's
 a


crappy
 quarter,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 crappy
 quarter,


though.


So,


look,
 I'm
 holding
 on.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think


next
 year
 SoFi
 should
 SoFi
 has
 not
 had
 a


massive
 massive
 move
 yet.
 It's
 had
 a


good
 move,
 but
 it's
 not
 been
 one
 of


those
 crazy
 moves.
 And
 I
 think
 next
 year


is
 setting
 up
 really
 productive
 for


Look,
 if
 they
 get
 a
 million
 members,
 I


don't
 care
 if
 the
 stock
 goes
 down.
 That


just
 means
 they're
 able
 to
 scale
 in
 such


a
 way
 that
 the
 next
 quarter
 is
 going
 to


be
 a
 million.
 The
 next
 quarter
 after


that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 1.1
 million.
 So,


like,
 I
 really
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 buying


the
 shares
 for
 a
 flip.
 I
 I
 really
 do


think
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 good


quarter.
 And
 if
 they
 don't,
 as
 long
 as


the
 results
 are
 good,
 I
 don't
 mind


buying
 more.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 not
 easy
 to


find
 good
 quality
 companies
 that
 can


grow
 and
 that
 are
 benefiting
 from
 rate


cuts
 and
 just,
 you
 know,
 business


regulation
 going
 down.
 So,


I'll
 be
 live
 tomorrow
 and
 we're
 going
 to


see
 what
 we
 get
 for
 SoFi.
 All right,


last
 question.
 Um,


last
 last
 question.
 What
 do
 we
 got?


Let's
 do


ask
 a
 question
 about
 the
 photos
 that
 you


showed.


You
 know,
 I
 would
 ask
 how
 many
 girls
 did


you
 see
 in
 the
 photo?
 But
 quite
 frankly,


there's
 too
 many
 to
 count.
 So,
 I
 mean,


like
 that's
 not
 a
 good
 that's
 not
 a
 good


question.
 You
 know,
 it's
 just
 like
 I
 you


know,
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 Don't
 need
 to
 to


worry
 too
 much
 about
 those
 questions.


Um,


ask
 us
 when
 your
 birthday
 is.


That's
 a
 good
 one.
 That's
 a
 good
 one.


Um,


let's
 do


let's
 do


Dude,
 it's
 so
 bad
 because
 it's
 like
 this


this
 helped
 nothing.
 All
 of
 you
 guys
 are


like,
 "Oh,
 that's
 the
 gay
 best
 friends."


Like,
 like,
 mind
 you.
 Okay,
 those
 girls


definitely
 know
 I'm
 not
 gay.
 Okay,
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 say
 how.
 I'll
 let
 everyone


else
 come
 to
 that
 conclusion,
 but
 it


didn't
 help
 my
 case
 given
 everyone
 else


said
 I'm
 just
 the
 gay
 best
 friend.
 Um,


let's
 do


let's
 do


let's
 do
 uh


man
 what's
 like
 this
 theme
 I
 was


thinking
 about
 in
 the
 morning.
 I
 don't


know if
 it's
 the
 best
 theme
 though
 to


end
 it
 off


Davis's
 but
 I
 know
 you
 are
 gay


firsthand.
 First
 of
 all,
 Davis,
 the


freaking
 pictures
 you
 Davis
 is
 cap.


First
 of
 all,
 Davis
 should
 not
 be
 saying


I'm
 G
 this
 gay
 ass
 caption
 that
 you


posted
 today,
 even
 though
 you
 ignore
 me


on
 all
 of
 our
 dates.
 I
 mean,
 he's


talking
 about
 gay.
 Goodness
 gracious,


bro.
 The
 reason
 I
 ignore
 you
 is
 because


you're
 not
 interesting.
 Whenever
 we
 sit


together,
 you
 start
 yapping
 about
 Zeta.


You
 think
 that's
 interesting?
 No,
 that's


not
 freaking
 interesting.


Like,
 talk
 about
 something
 better.
 Keep


me
 entertained,
 bro.


Freaking
 Davis,
 bro.
 Freaking
 Davis.
 Um,


okay.
 So,


I
 think
 let's
 do


I
 think
 let's
 do


I
 think
 I
 asked
 this
 question
 before,


but
 it's
 an
 old
 one.
 Uh,


Amcort
 did
 their
 earnings.
 Yes,
 we
 we'll


I'll
 I'll
 get
 an
 update
 on
 it's
 down


three
 and
 a
 half%.
 It's
 basically
 back


to
 where
 it
 was
 on
 Friday,
 32
 bucks.


I'll
 go
 through
 their
 earnings
 and
 see


what
 I
 I
 bet
 you
 it's
 their
 gross


margins
 probably
 were
 not
 as
 good
 as
 the


street
 expected


and
 because
 the
 growth
 the
 topline


revenue
 growth
 is
 phenomenal.
 I
 mean


that's
 the
 best
 quarter
 they've
 ever


had.
 EPS
 was
 also
 better
 than
 expected.


I
 bet
 you
 the
 gross
 margins
 were
 a


little
 bit
 lower
 and
 that's
 probably
 why


the
 stock's
 down
 2%.


But
 that's
 not
 the
 worst
 reason
 given,


you
 know,
 the
 margin
 expansion
 is
 the


sort
 of
 bullcase
 for
 them
 in
 the
 first


place.


Okay,
 let's
 do


let's
 do


uh


there's
 some
 really
 easy
 ones,
 but
 I


kind
 of
 want
 to
 end
 it
 off
 on
 something


that's
 not
 as
 easy.
 Um,


Joseph
 Carlson
 should
 be
 an
 answer.


Uh
 yeah,
 Amcore
 CEO
 is
 retiring
 as
 well.


I
 mean,
 if
 they're
 going
 to
 give
 it
 a
 2%


hit
 off
 the
 CEO
 retiring,
 I
 mean,
 like


that's
 usually
 stocks
 drop
 like
 10%
 when


the
 CEO
 leaves,
 so
 that's
 actually
 not


the
 worst.


Okay.
 Okay.
 Let's
 do
 Let's
 do
 um
 Let's


do


maybe


let's
 let's
 freaking
 Let's
 do


Dude,
 there's
 a
 couple
 of
 these
 we
 could


do.


There's
 a
 couple
 of
 these
 we
 could
 do.


Who
 is
 Stephen
 Flo's
 favorite
 creator?


Joseph
 Carlson.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.
 Bro,
 I


need
 to
 use
 the
 bathroom.
 Hurry
 up.


Okay.
 Um,


dude,
 we
 got
 to
 do
 the
 super
 chats,
 too.


So,
 let
 me
 let
 me
 do
 this
 and
 then
 we'll


get
 super
 chats.
 Let's
 do
 which
 tooth


needed
 the
 root
 canal.
 I
 don't
 expect


you
 guys
 to
 know
 the
 exact
 tooth
 that


needed
 the
 root
 canal.


Someone
 knew
 that.
 That'd
 be
 kind
 of


scary.
 Like,
 how
 did
 you
 know?
 Like,
 are


you
 actually
 my
 dentist
 if
 you
 knew


that?
 That's
 a
 little
 aggressive.
 Um,


this
 one's
 kind
 of
 basic,
 but
 I
 feel


like


this
 one's
 kind
 of
 basic.


Damn,
 this
 one's
 kind
 of
 basic.
 I
 don't


know if
 we
 should
 do
 that
 one.


Uh,


[Music]


okay.
 Let's
 do


Let's
 do


Let's
 do
 Let
 me
 just
 confirm
 this.
 It


might
 not
 be.


I
 think


I
 think
 we
 can
 still
 do
 this


if
 we
 do
 it
 from


Well,


well,
 actually,
 I
 think
 we
 can
 do
 this.


This
 is
 a
 good
 one.
 This
 is
 a
 good
 one.


It
 Okay,
 so
 all
 right,
 we'll
 do
 this.


Um,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 pretty
 easy
 one.


If
 you've
 been
 part
 of
 the
 channel,


you've
 definitely
 heard
 me
 say
 it.
 Uh,


your
 answers
 have
 to
 be
 in
 in
 Okay,
 so


there's
 five
 answers
 to
 this.
 Okay,


let's
 do
 this
 one.
 We'll
 end
 it
 out
 on


this.
 Five
 answers.
 Everything
 should
 be


in
 one
 comment.
 Okay,
 here
 we
 go.
 Very


simple.
 Let
 me
 just
 write
 it
 down
 so
 I


make
 sure.


It
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 the
 exact
 You


You'll
 get
 what
 I
 mean
 when
 I
 say,
 but
 I


I'll
 know
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 winning
 on


this.


Where
 were
 the
 five
 places
 we
 did
 a


meetup
 at
 in
 2025?
 Where
 were
 the
 five


places
 we
 did
 a
 meetup
 at
 in
 2025?


In
 one
 in
 one
 answer,
 where
 were
 the


five
 places
 we
 did
 a
 meetup
 at?


Wow,
 someone
 got
 it
 quick,
 bro.


Someone
 got
 it
 quick.
 Saunders
 Melody,


that's
 not
 a
 horrible
 question
 either.
 I


mean,
 the
 meetups
 have
 been
 a
 big
 part


of
 the
 channel.
 Everyone's
 known
 about


the
 meetups
 like
 and
 I'm
 asking
 for
 five


locations
 so
 it
 definitely
 requires
 a


little bit
 of
 work.
 It's
 not
 like
 you


can
 just
 copy
 and
 paste
 it
 from


somewhere.
 Michelle
 says
 not
 Houston.


Yes,
 not
 Houston.
 Saunders
 Melody,


you
 got
 that
 pretty
 quick,
 dude.
 Got


that
 real
 quick.
 It's
 almost
 like
 you


knew
 that
 answer
 beforehand.


Are
 you
 Are
 you
 Chanty
 Bip's
 cousin
 or


something?
 What's
 What's
 going
 on
 here?


But
 Saunders
 Melody,
 you
 got
 it.
 Miami,


New
 York,
 Boston,
 Toronto,
 and


California.


There
 you
 go.


You
 wrote
 it
 before
 the
 question.
 Yeah,


bro.
 That's
 a
 little
 little
 sus.
 I'm


just
 saying.
 Saunders
 Melody.
 Little
 sus


right
 there.
 By
 the
 way,
 shout
 out
 to


Zold
 who's
 in
 the
 chat.
 This
 hoodie
 is


literally
 from
 Zokold.


Love
 you,
 brother.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 Zold
 is
 an
 OG.
 has
 been
 watching


the
 channel
 for
 years
 and
 uh
 he
 got
 me


this
 hoodie
 back
 in
 Vegas
 in
 2023.
 I


still
 remember
 and
 that's
 that's


actually
 kind
 of
 one
 of the
 the
 reasons


I
 wanted
 to
 wear
 it
 today
 because
 it
 was


it
 was
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 hoodies
 I
 got
 on
 my


birthday
 long
 time
 and
 I
 love
 this


hoodie.
 It's
 like
 super
 it's
 just
 like


it's
 a
 comfortable
 hoodie
 and
 it's
 like


warm
 and
 all
 that
 stuff.
 So,
 thank
 you


Zold.
 Love
 you,
 man.
 Appreciate
 you.


He's
 been
 at
 he
 was
 at
 the
 Miami
 meet
 up


with
 his
 cousin
 and
 him
 and
 his
 wife
 are


awesome.
 his
 cousin
 and
 and
 his
 wife
 are


just
 amazing.
 Like
 you
 guys
 are
 just
 a


great
 great
 family
 together
 and
 it
 was


super
 super
 cool
 seeing
 everybody


together
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 So
 awesome


stuff.
 Awesome
 awesome
 stuff.
 All right,


that's
 all
 we
 got.
 Those
 are
 the


giveaways.
 Please
 make
 sure
 to
 email
 me.


I
 will
 get
 you
 guys
 the
 Amazon
 gift


cards
 hopefully
 by
 tomorrow
 night
 at
 the


latest.
 And
 um


yeah,
 again
 I
 went
 on
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 long


rant
 in
 the
 morning
 for
 the
 market
 open,


but
 I
 am
 very
 very
 very
 very
 grateful
 to


be
 in
 this
 position
 in
 life.
 I
 do
 not


take
 it
 for
 granted.
 I
 want
 to
 make
 sure


I
 uh
 just
 do
 my
 best
 to
 continue


providing
 value
 and
 you
 know,
 shout
 out


to
 Steve
 and
 Matt
 and
 Roy
 and
 Tanner.
 I


did
 not
 expect
 them
 to
 all
 get
 on
 just


to
 say
 happy
 birthday
 and
 Chris
 like
 uh


they're
 really
 good
 friends.
 They
 are


really
 really
 good
 friends
 and
 you
 know


you
 could
 tell
 they
 they
 actually
 care


about
 you
 as
 a
 human
 more.
 Like
 if
 I
 had


a
 life
 problem
 that
 I
 needed
 to
 talk
 and


I've
 had
 problems
 in
 life
 before
 that
 I


need
 to
 like
 legit
 call
 up
 one
 of
 these


guys
 and
 ask
 their
 perspective
 on.
 I


mean
 they're
 there.
 They're
 there.
 You


know
 there
 was
 some
 stuff
 a
 couple
 years


ago
 I
 had
 to
 I
 really
 needed
 some
 good


advice
 and
 I
 talked
 to
 Steve
 and
 you


know
 just
 having
 a
 friend
 where
 you
 can


like
 he
 can
 you
 know
 especially
 friend


that's
 a
 bit
 older
 has
 been
 through
 some


life
 experience
 that
 can
 give
 you
 some


perspectives.
 It
 really
 means
 a
 lot.
 So,


you
 know,
 these
 are
 not
 just
 people
 that


I
 talk
 stocks,
 but
 I
 talk
 about


everything
 with
 these
 guys,
 and
 it


really
 means
 the
 world
 to
 have
 all
 of


them
 here.
 So,


there
 you
 go.
 That's
 what
 we
 got.
 That's


the
 giveaway.
 I
 hope
 you
 guys
 enjoyed


the
 photo
 session.
 We'll
 do
 this
 again


probably
 like
 New
 Year's.
 I
 mean,
 Steve


already
 booked
 me
 for
 New
 Year's,
 so
 he


said
 I
 can't
 go
 anywhere
 anywhere.
 So,


on
 New
 Year's
 Eve,
 if
 you
 have
 nothing


to
 do,
 I'll
 probably
 be
 live
 with
 Steve.


And
 Steve
 has
 shown
 some
 photos
 of
 his


past
 before.
 Maybe
 we
 can
 get
 Steve
 to


show
 some
 some
 uh
 some
 more
 of
 his


younger
 days
 because
 Steve
 was
 a
 wild


kid
 when
 he
 was
 in
 his
 20s.
 You
 guys


don't
 know
 the
 real
 Steve,
 bro.
 The
 real


Steve
 was
 different.


The
 real
 You
 should
 ask
 him
 like,


"Steve,
 how
 are
 your
 20s
 like?
 Let's
 see


how
 much
 he
 avoids
 the
 question."


Because
 he
 he
 was
 a
 wild
 a
 wild
 young


kid
 and
 now
 he
 seems
 all
 relaxed
 and


mature
 and
 all.
 That's
 cuz
 he
 he
 had


some
 fun
 when
 he
 was
 when
 he
 was
 in
 his


20s
 and
 30s.
 I
 think
 he
 settled
 down


like
 around
 33,
 34,
 but
 in
 his
 20s,
 he


had
 a
 great
 time.
 So,


his
 mafia
 pass.
 Yeah,
 we'll
 uh
 we'll
 do


this
 again.
 And,
 you
 know,
 I'll
 tell
 my


assistant
 going
 into
 New
 Year's
 Eve
 to


go
 curate
 some
 more
 pictures.
 I'll
 see


what
 she
 comes
 up
 with.
 I'll
 try
 to
 make


sure
 that
 the
 pictures
 aren't
 dominated


by
 one
 theme.
 I
 didn't
 expect
 her
 to


pick
 all
 these
 pictures
 that
 showed
 what


they
 showed
 today,
 but
 I'm,
 you
 know,


I'm
 I
 really
 didn't
 have
 time
 to


organize
 the
 pictures.
 So,
 I'm
 happy


that
 she
 did
 what
 she
 had
 to
 do
 and
 you


guys
 got
 to
 see
 the
 uh
 the
 past
 life.


Maybe
 we
 got
 to
 change
 the
 narrative
 a


little
 bit.
 Maybe
 we
 added
 fuel
 to
 the


flyer
 on
 the
 narrative.
 Who
 who
 who


knows?
 But
 nonetheless,
 we
 got
 to
 we
 got


to
 share
 some
 stuff.
 All right,
 let
 me


get
 out
 of
 here.
 Let
 me
 do
 some
 super


chats.
 Thank
 you
 again
 for
 being
 here.


You
 guys
 do
 not
 have
 to
 send
 the
 super


chats.
 It
 really
 really
 means
 a
 lot
 for


everyone
 being
 here.
 But
 appreciate
 you


all
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 I'll
 be
 live
 on
 Tech


Bros
 tonight
 with
 Tanner
 and
 Roy
 and


we'll
 talk
 more
 tech
 and
 we'll
 keep


going
 from
 there.
 Uh
 Triple
 V,
 thank
 you


for
 the
 $200
 super
 chat.
 I
 was
 talking


to
 you
 this
 morning.
 Deeply
 deeply


appreciate
 your
 friendship
 and
 your


guidance
 over
 the
 past
 year
 as
 we've


gotten
 to
 know
 each
 other
 and
 you
 know


just
 being
 supportive
 in
 in
 the
 in
 the


chat
 every
 day
 means
 a
 lot.
 So
 thank
 you


TripleB
 for
 the
 $200
 super
 chat
 and


thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Um,
 Parzville


Zero,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $200
 super
 chat.


Happy
 birthday,
 man.
 Thank
 you
 for


building
 this
 great
 community.
 It's
 a


wonderful
 space
 to
 have
 where
 we
 can


exchange
 market
 insights
 and
 celebrate


the
 wins.
 Cheers,
 Parall.
 Thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 I
 think
 you've
 you've
 just


joined
 the
 channel
 over
 the
 past
 couple


months,
 but
 it
 it
 means
 a
 ton
 on
 a
 day


like
 this.
 Wow.
 SoFi
 30.5


after
 hours,
 baby.


Dude,
 hopefully
 we
 can
 keep
 the
 party


going
 tomorrow
 on
 SoFi
 earnings.


Um,
 yeah,
 on
 a
 day
 where
 you
 have
 big


wins
 like
 we're
 seeing
 in
 in
 the
 broader


market,
 it
 definitely
 means
 a
 lot
 to
 do


with
 the
 community.
 So,
 thank
 you,


Parville,
 and
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.


Angela,
 you
 gave
 a
 super
 chat
 in
 the


morning,
 so
 you
 do
 not
 need
 to
 give


another
 one,
 but
 thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 I
 deeply
 appreciate
 the
 second


super
 chat
 amid,
 happy
 birthday.
 Been
 a


great
 few
 years
 watching
 since
 Finance


Junkies.
 I
 love
 it.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 we
 we


we
 stopped
 that
 podcast
 back
 in
 the


later
 half
 of
 2023.
 Honestly,
 all
 of
 us


just
 got
 really
 busy.
 like
 Vatitali
 had


a
 bunch
 of
 different
 job
 commitments.


He's
 a
 producer,
 so
 he's
 traveling
 all


the
 time.
 Carlos
 had
 two
 kids.
 You
 know,


you
 can't
 really
 do
 a
 podcast
 all
 the


time
 when
 you
 have
 kids.
 Um
 Chris


obviously
 got
 busy
 with
 stuff
 in
 life.


And
 then
 I
 got
 really
 busy
 with
 all
 the


traveling.
 So,
 it
 was
 it
 was
 really
 fun


to
 to
 do
 that
 every
 day.
 And,
 you
 know,


I
 think
 we
 cultivated
 a
 really
 good


community
 for
 all
 of
 us.
 And,
 you
 know,


we're
 all
 pretty
 still
 pretty
 good


friends.
 We
 all
 still
 talk,
 but


obviously
 we
 don't
 do
 the
 podcast


anymore.
 It's
 just
 things
 have
 evolved.


And
 I
 think
 the
 way
 things
 have
 evolved


has
 created
 an
 even
 deeper
 community


across
 all
 the
 new
 characters
 like
 Matt


and
 Roy
 and
 Tanner
 and
 all
 these
 people


that
 were
 making
 content
 back
 then
 but


not
 as
 you
 know
 not
 as
 much
 as
 they're


making
 today.
 And
 you
 know
 now
 we're
 all


here.
 So
 it's
 almost
 like
 Finance


Junkies
 was
 like
 four
 guys
 getting


together
 to
 talk
 stocks
 and
 it
 was
 very


special.
 But
 now
 throughout
 these


streams
 whether
 it's
 my
 stream
 or


Chris's
 stream
 or
 Matt's
 stream
 or


Tanner's
 stream
 or
 Royy's
 stream


everyone
 just
 hops
 on
 each
 other's


streams
 and
 we
 talk
 stocks.
 So,
 it's


really
 cool
 how
 it's
 just
 turned
 into


like
 the
 de
 facto
 thing
 that
 people
 do


online
 and
 that,
 you
 know,
 that
 was


really
 fun.


Tess
 says,
 "Was
 it
 that
 long
 ago?
 I'm


getting
 old."
 No,
 Tess,
 you
 are
 young.
 I


will
 never
 say
 Tess
 is
 old
 because
 last


time
 I
 even
 implied
 that
 she
 might
 be


getting
 older.
 I
 I
 I
 I
 definitely
 got
 a


mouthful.
 So,
 no,
 Tess,
 you
 are


incredibly
 young
 and
 you
 will
 continue


to
 just
 get
 younger.
 That's
 what's
 going


to
 happen.
 Maybe
 quantum
 computing
 can


make
 people
 younger,
 bro.
 Maybe.
 By
 the


way,
 again,
 this
 is
 why
 Skrey's
 quantum


short
 is
 stupid,
 bro.
 The
 Olen
 podcast


just
 did
 a
 episode
 with
 a
 quantum


physicist
 who
 got
 a
 Nobel
 Prize
 for
 his


research.


There's
 too
 many
 catalysts
 to
 short


these
 stocks,
 even
 if
 you
 don't
 like


their
 valuations.


So,
 you
 know,
 when
 you
 have
 media
 like


that
 getting
 distributed,
 might
 not
 be


the
 easiest
 short.
 Dun,
 thank
 you
 for


the
 11
 super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 Mitt.


wish
 you
 a
 good
 health
 and
 a
 boyfriend.


I
 mean,
 beautiful
 day.


Thanks,
 Dun.
 Appreciate
 it.
 Thank
 you


for
 your
 parents
 for
 letting
 us
 being


able
 to
 troll
 you
 on
 the
 daily.
 Love


you,
 man.
 No
 homo.
 Appreciate
 you,
 Duns.


Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 I
 thought
 the


photos
 would
 clear
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 of


the
 allegations,
 but
 I
 guess
 not.


I
 guess
 not.
 Thank
 you,
 Dun.
 Appreciate


you
 being
 here.
 Uh,
 Sarth,
 thank
 you
 for


the
 $2
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 man.
 Thank


you
 for
 your
 content.
 Thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 Sam,
 what's
 up,
 man?
 Guess


where
 Grab
 closed
 at?
 Yep.
 We
 closed
 at


612.
 Not
 too
 bad.
 Earnings
 coming
 up.


Nice
 move
 from
 540
 last
 week.
 If
 you


bought
 the
 dip
 anywhere
 below
 basically


580,
 it's
 been
 a
 pretty
 good
 return.
 We


just
 got
 to
 get
 a
 really
 good
 earnings.


We
 got
 to
 get
 a
 good
 earnings
 and


hopefully
 that
 can
 create
 more
 of
 a


rerating.
 Thank
 you,
 Sam,
 for
 being


here.
 TJ,
 thank
 you
 for
 becoming
 a


channel
 member.
 Appreciate
 it.
 Helen,


thank
 you
 for
 the
 $20
 shad.
 Happy


birthday,
 Mit.
 Wish
 you
 the
 best.


Appreciate
 you
 here
 with
 us
 through
 the


ups
 and
 downs.
 Helen,
 thank
 you
 for


being
 here
 every
 single
 day
 as
 well.
 Ups


or
 downs.
 Deeply
 appreciate
 you
 being


here
 and
 being
 part
 of
 the
 channel.
 SC


Austin,

 you

 the
 $51
 super


chat.
 Mid
 wishing
 you
 a
 happy
 birthday.


Wishing
 many
 happy
 returns
 of

My
 wife

 sweet,


pleasant
 relationships
 of
 life.
 Uh
 thank


you
 SC
 for
 being
 here.
 I
 I
 really
 do


appreciate
 it.
 When
 when
 couples
 or
 you


know
 people
 with
 kids
 are
 watching
 the


show,
 it
 means
 a
 lot
 just
 for
 that
 to
 be


part
 of
 the
 the
 the
 family,
 you
 know,
 to


to
 to
 welcome
 you
 into
 your
 lives,
 into


your
 cars,
 into
 your
 living
 rooms.
 So,


thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Steve's
 in
 the


chat.
 Steve
 says,
 "Happy
 birthday."


Steve,
 I
 appreciate
 you,
 man.
 You
 didn't


have
 to
 organize
 that
 that
 group
 happy


birthday
 wish,
 but
 uh
 it
 means
 a
 lot,


Steve.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 And
 by


the
 way,
 guys,
 I
 mean,
 again,
 Steve
 is


crushing
 it.
 He's
 about
 to
 hit
 he's


about
 to
 hit
 freaking
 uh


he's
 about
 to
 hit
 freaking
 20,
 not
 20,


10,000
 subscribers
 pretty
 soon.
 8.9,000.


For
 those
 that
 haven't
 subscribed,


definitely
 make
 sure
 to
 give
 him
 a


subscribe.
 I
 mean,
 outside
 of
 all
 the


fun
 stuff
 that
 he
 talks
 about
 on
 his


streams,
 uh
 the
 market
 commentary
 is


very,
 very
 good.
 So,
 you
 can
 definitely


check
 out
 Steve
 right
 there.
 Steve,


again,
 appreciate
 you,
 buddy.
 You
 did


not
 have
 to
 do
 that
 for
 me
 on
 a
 Monday


afternoon,
 but
 it
 uh
 it
 means
 a
 lot.


TJS,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 gift
 of
 10


memberships.
 Appreciate
 you
 for
 the
 gift


of
 10.
 Thank
 you
 for
 that.
 Brian
 KNYC,


thank
 you
 for
 the
 101
 super
 chat.
 A


longtime
 lurker
 breaking
 my
 silence
 to


wish
 you
 a
 very
 happy
 birthday.
 You've


enriched
 me
 in
 a
 multitude
 of
 ways
 and


you're
 the
 only
 financial
 YouTuber
 I


know
 who
 never
 exploits
 his
 audience.


That
 sincerity
 makes
 you
 a
 one
 of
 a


kind.
 Keep
 being
 you.
 Brian,
 thank
 you


for
 being
 here.
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people


are
 just,
 as
 you
 say,
 lurkers.
 They


don't
 really
 comment
 or
 do
 much,
 but


they
 listen
 every
 day.
 And
 quite


frankly,
 I'm
 like
 that
 for
 a
 lot
 of


other
 content
 creators.
 I
 I
 I
 mean,
 I


comment
 on
 like
 Steve's
 videos
 and
 my


and
 Tanner's,
 you
 know,
 my
 but
 I
 don't


really
 comment
 actively
 on
 like
 other


stuff
 that
 I
 watch.
 Um,
 and
 so,
 you


know,
 for
 the
 people
 that
 don't
 comment


but
 still
 consume
 the
 content,
 you
 know,


I'm
 deeply
 grateful
 and
 I
 know
 that


hopefully
 the
 content
 uh
 is
 valuable


regardless
 of
 if
 you're
 in
 the
 chat
 or


not.
 And
 like
 Triple
 V,
 he
 never
 checks


the
 chat
 even
 though
 he
 sends
 a
 super


chat
 every
 other
 day.
 Um,
 so
 I
 I


appreciate
 you
 watching
 and
 keeping
 up


with
 the
 show
 every
 single
 day.
 Beans,


thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Happy


birthday,
 brother.
 Found
 you
 from
 the


dumb
 money
 video.
 I've
 been
 watching


daily
 ever
 since.
 You
 have
 made
 my


friends
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 and
 in
 return
 I


have
 shared
 what
 I've
 learned
 from
 you


with
 my
 friends.
 They
 are
 doing
 very


well.
 Cheers.


I
 love
 it.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 segue
 uh


has
 been
 someone
 discovers
 content
 in


the
 stock
 market
 space,
 they
 get
 into
 a


stock
 or
 get
 into
 a
 way
 of
 thinking
 and


then
 they
 get
 their
 friends
 hooked
 on


it.
 I
 mean,
 I've
 heard
 this
 story
 so


many
 times
 from
 people,
 especially
 at


the
 Miami
 meetup
 where,
 you
 know,
 one


guy
 actually
 brought
 three
 other
 guys


just
 because
 those
 three
 guys
 got
 into


my
 content
 because
 that
 one
 guy
 was,
 you


know,
 really
 consuming
 it
 every
 day
 and


then
 they
 all
 started
 investing
 together


and
 it
 was
 awesome.
 And
 then
 they
 they


they
 they
 got
 to
 talk
 to
 Derek
 for
 like


two
 hours
 and
 pick
 his
 brain
 about
 life


and
 entrepreneurship.
 So
 yeah,
 really


appreciate
 those
 that
 that
 spread


through
 the
 word
 of
 mouth.
 And
 shout
 out


to
 Dumb
 Money,
 Chris
 Camilllo.
 Awesome


guy.
 I
 actually
 rec
 I
 made
 an
 investment


in
 a
 private
 startup.
 I
 I
 just
 sent
 the


money
 yesterday
 by
 the
 way.
 That
 that


startup,
 bro,
 that
 startup
 is
 like


exploding
 on
 the
 timeline.
 What
 I
 mean


by
 that
 is
 like


over
 the
 weekend
 they
 grew
 like
 20x.


It's
 kind
 of
 crazy.
 I
 I
 got
 I
 got
 some


of
 the
 updates
 today
 and
 I
 was
 like,


goodness
 gracious.
 So,
 uh
 at
 November


6th,
 I
 should
 be
 able
 to
 announce
 what


the
 startup
 is
 and
 you
 guys
 can
 check
 it


out.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of you
 guys
 will


actually
 be
 interested
 in
 it.
 Some
 of


you
 guys
 won't
 care,
 but
 it's
 in
 the


finance
 space.
 Let's
 say
 that
 it's
 in


the
 finance
 space.
 But,
 um
 I
 asked


Camilo
 before
 I
 uh
 I
 should
 invest.
 I


was
 like,
 "Yo,
 I
 sent
 him
 the
 I
 was


like,
 "Yo,
 would
 you
 invest
 in
 this?"


And
 he
 ended
 up
 passing
 on
 it,
 but
 he
 he


gave
 me
 some
 good
 ways
 to
 think
 about


private
 market
 investing
 because
 he's


done
 a
 lot
 of
 private
 market


investments.
 And
 you
 know,
 I
 ended
 up
 I


ended
 up
 putting
 some
 money
 in.
 So,


we're
 going to
 see
 longterm
 play.
 It's


not
 Stock
 App.
 It's
 not
 Derek's
 company.


It's
 not
 a
 public
 round,
 unfortunately,


yet.
 I
 think
 eventually
 it'll
 be
 public.


The
 only
 reason
 I
 got
 access
 to
 this,
 I


told
 you
 guys
 it
 was
 someone
 I
 debated


in
 high
 school.
 He
 knew
 me.
 We
 haven't


talked
 for
 10
 years.
 He
 hit
 me
 up
 the


other
 day
 because
 he's
 been
 keeping
 up


with
 my
 content.
 And
 uh
 he
 was
 like,


"Yo,
 do
 you
 want
 to invest?"
 And
 I
 heard


the
 pitch
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Yeah,
 I
 think


I'm
 going
 to
 have
 to
 invest."
 First
 of


all,
 it's
 a
 good
 idea.
 Second
 of
 all,
 we


haven't
 talked
 in
 10
 years.
 like
 there's


no
 way
 you're
 going
 to
 become
 a


billionaire
 without
 me.
 So,
 if
 if
 this


thing
 ever
 gets
 to
 that
 level,
 I
 mean,


who
 knows?
 Startups
 are
 really
 hard.
 I


could
 probably
 lose
 all
 my
 money,
 but
 uh


you
 know,
 it's
 worth
 taking
 a
 shot.
 So,


I
 think
 if
 they
 do
 do
 a
 public
 offering,


then
 you'll
 have
 a
 lot
 more
 people
 that


have
 the
 chance
 to
 invest.
 3067
 on
 SoFi.


We
 hit
 3070,
 folks.
 Someone's
 buying


after
 hours.


Someone
 is
 buying
 after
 hours.


Looks
 like
 Tanner
 is
 going
 to
 survive


and
 he's
 not
 going
 to
 get
 [ __ ]
 from
 all


of
 us
 if
 Sofi
 does
 well.
 Now,
 Sofi


doesn't
 do
 well.
 We
 still
 got
 to
 give


Tanner
 [ __ ]
 for
 the
 hell
 of
 it.
 Even


though
 it's
 not
 his
 fault,
 but
 you
 know,


it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 We
 got
 to
 we
 got
 to


give
 him
 some
 [ __ ]
 But
 if
 they
 do
 well,


we
 got
 to
 give
 him
 a
 lot
 of
 love
 because


he
 deserves
 it.
 This
 guy
 has
 been


preaching
 the
 SoFi
 thesis
 for
 so
 long.


Uh
 Abig,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $20
 super


chat.
 Appreciate
 it.
 Thank
 you
 for


saying
 happy
 birthday.
 Linda,
 thank
 you


for
 the
 $50
 super
 chat.
 means
 a
 lot.


Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here
 as
 well
 and


thank
 you
 for


uh
 it's
 not
 fiscal
 AI.
 It's
 not
 fiscal


AI.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat
 as


well.
 This
 this
 this
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 people


don't
 know
 about
 it's
 very
 underground


but
 you
 know
 it's
 just
 an
 old
 friend


from
 high
 school.
 So
 that's
 why
 I


invested.
 But
 uh
 who
 knows?
 I
 think


they'll
 do
 well
 over
 time.
 We're
 going


to
 see.
 Linda,
 thank
 you
 again
 for
 the


$50
 super
 chat.
 Means
 a
 lot.
 Thank
 you


for
 being
 here.
 Changi,
 thanks
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday.
 Thanks
 for


turning
 the
 boring
 bits
 of
 investing


into
 something
 that
 I
 actually
 look


forward
 to
 watching.


Yeah,
 I
 I
 try
 to
 make
 investing
 as
 non-


boring
 as
 possible.
 I
 think
 that's
 kind


of
 the
 reason
 people
 were
 attracted
 to


the
 channel
 in
 the
 first
 place,
 just
 the


deep
 dives
 and
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 energy


we
 bring
 every
 day
 to
 the
 stream.
 And


so,
 yeah,
 I
 appreciate
 it.
 You
 know,


some
 people
 think
 it's
 cringe
 when
 you


react
 like,
 "Oh,
 the
 stock's
 down
 10%


and
 you're
 freaking
 out."
 I
 know
 there's


a
 subset
 of
 people
 that
 think
 it's


cringe
 when
 you
 give
 a
 reaction
 like


that
 and,
 you
 know,
 you're
 too
 animated.


But
 I
 also
 think
 the
 masses
 need
 that


animation
 to
 be
 excited.
 I
 need
 that


animation
 to
 be
 excited.
 Otherwise,
 it's


just
 like,
 okay,
 a
 stock
 goes
 up,
 stock


goes
 down.
 What's
 the
 point
 of
 it,
 you


know?


So,
 yeah,
 I
 I
 I
 do
 try
 to
 have
 as
 much


energy
 as
 we
 possibly
 can.
 Ganakus,

 Happy
 birthday,
 man.


Thanks
 for
 all
 you
 do.
 Thanks
 for


engaging
 with
 me
 on
 X,
 which
 led
 me
 to


your
 YouTube
 channel.
 Your
 market


insight
 has
 been
 very
 helpful.


Appreciate
 you.
 Appreciate
 you
 as
 well.


Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 And
 um
 yeah,


whether
 it's
 X
 or
 YouTube,
 I
 appreciate


you
 keeping
 up
 with
 the
 content


regardless,
 which
 uh
 which
 means
 a
 ton.


Uh,


Aeroflu
 says,
 "If
 it
 weren't
 for
 you,
 I


would
 have
 panic
 sold."
 Dude,
 back
 in


April,
 I
 mean,
 I
 had
 to
 convince
 myself


to
 not
 panic
 sell
 either,
 right?
 You


know,
 so
 it
 was
 it
 was
 just
 one
 of
 those


things
 where
 we
 stayed
 we
 stayed
 the


course
 in
 April
 and
 and
 Steve,
 you
 know,


did
 a
 great
 job
 as
 well.
 I
 think
 calming


a
 lot
 of
 us
 down
 like
 this
 whole


community.
 Chris
 is
 what
 Chris
 was


buying
 the
 hell
 out
 of
 the
 dip
 and
 Chris


can
 get
 very
 bearish
 at
 moments,
 right?


Even
 Chris
 was
 like,
 "No,
 this
 is


stupid.
 like
 this
 is
 a
 so
 I
 think
 all
 of


us
 collectively
 kind
 of
 came
 to
 the


conclusion
 that
 this
 is
 a
 buy


and
 uh
 you
 know
 that's
 why
 that's
 why


we're
 here.
 Mila,
 thank
 you

 Happy
 birthday

 Mila,


thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 It


was
 great
 seeing
 you
 in
 Miami
 as
 well.


Um
 for
 those
 that
 don't
 know,
 Mila


teaches
 language.
 So,
 you
 know,
 for
 all


the
 [ __ ]
 I
 give
 language
 learning


because
 of
 freaking
 Dolingo.
 Uh
 I


appreciate
 you
 Mila
 so
 much
 and
 thank


you
 for
 being
 here.
 Hopefully
 we'll
 see


you
 at
 another
 meetup.
 Duolingo
 down


another
 1%
 on
 the
 day.
 All right,


Duolingo
 is
 gonna
 have
 to
 put
 up
 a
 good


earnings.
 I'm
 g
 have
 to
 put
 up
 a
 good


earnings
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 that
 narrative.


Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here,
 Ron
 G.
 Thanks


so
 much
 super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 man.


Thanks
 for
 all
 that
 you
 do
 for
 us.
 Ron


G,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 And
 thank


you
 for
 the
 um


the


super
 chat.
 Alex,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 I
 just
 wonder
 if
 we
 bulls


may
 be
 underestimating
 how
 much
 sales


and
 marketing
 and
 product
 design
 spend


may
 knock
 off
 EPS.
 Bullish,
 though.
 I


think
 they're
 talking
 about
 SoFi.
 Yeah,


I
 mean,
 look,
 maybe
 marketing
 is
 a
 bit


more
 aggressive
 this
 quarter
 and
 that's


how
 they
 get
 to
 that
 million
 member


number
 that
 Tanner's
 been
 talking
 about


and
 maybe
 that
 could
 hurt
 EPS.
 I
 wonder


if
 the
 trade-off
 of
 hurting
 EPS
 with


growth
 is
 going
 to
 matter
 that
 much
 to


the
 street.
 If
 they
 can
 get
 growth


without
 hurting
 EPS,
 that
 would
 be
 super


bullish.
 But


we'll
 find
 out
 tomorrow
 7
 a.m.
 and
 we'll


see
 what
 these
 numbers
 look
 like.
 Zubar,


thank
 you
 for
 the
 $100
 super
 chat.
 Happy


birthday,
 Mitt.
 Thank
 you
 for


everything.
 Can't
 wait
 to
 see
 you
 in


Houston.


Yeah,
 you
 and
 Michelle.
 you
 and
 Michelle


both.
 I
 was
 supposed
 to
 do
 Houston
 for
 a


meetup
 this
 year.
 We
 just
 didn't
 have
 a


chance.
 And
 then
 Texas
 is
 so
 big,
 so


it's
 hard
 to
 do
 Houston,
 Dallas,
 Austin.


Which
 one
 do
 we
 do?
 So,
 unfortunately,


we
 weren't
 able
 to
 do
 Texas,
 but


hopefully
 we
 end
 up
 doing
 it
 uh
 in
 2026.


Thank
 you
 again
 for
 the
 $100

Amidst

 once
 again,
 thank
 you


for
 the
 $20

 Hi
 there.
 Um,


Dr.
 Dixie
 Dental
 Floss.
 Amidst
 dentist,


the
 name
 says
 it
 all.


I
 feel
 like
 this
 is
 just
 going
 to
 become


a
 meme
 at
 this
 point.
 This
 dentist


thing,
 just
 like
 the
 milkman
 for
 Steve


in
 the
 chat,
 but
 I
 appreciate
 it,


dentist.
 And
 thank
 actually,
 you
 know,


ironically,
 I'm
 seeing
 the
 dentist
 again


tomorrow.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 have
 to
 leave


the
 stream
 at
 like
 10:50
 because
 it's


like
 a
 30-minut
 drive.
 I
 have
 11:30


appointment,
 but
 yeah,
 they're
 going to


make
 sure
 everything's
 okay.
 So,


I
 guess
 I
 will
 be
 seeing
 uh
 Dr.
 Dentist


tomorrow
 as
 well.

 Happy


birthday,
 bro.
 We
 need
 an
 AK
 Media


clothing
 line.
 I
 don't
 think
 I'm
 ever


going
 to
 come
 out
 with
 clothing
 or


merch.
 I've
 just
 never
 really
 been
 a
 fan


of
 it.
 But
 I
 do
 appreciate
 you
 being


here.
 If
 we
 did
 have
 merch,
 there
 would


be
 so
 many
 fun
 sayings
 to
 put
 on
 that


merch
 that
 would
 make
 no
 sense
 to


anybody
 else.
 But
 appreciate
 you
 and


thank
 for
 being
 part
 of
 the
 of
 the


channel.


Um,


Deuce,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $10
 super
 chat.


Amit,
 you
 and
 my
 girlfriend
 Britney
 have


the
 same
 birthday.
 Happy
 birthday.
 Can


she
 get
 a
 shout
 out
 from
 you?
 Britney,


happy
 birthday.
 Thank
 you
 for
 uh
 letting


your
 boyfriend
 watch
 the
 show
 on
 your


birthday
 and
 that
 means
 a
 lot.
 And
 if


you
 watch
 it
 as
 well,
 deeply,
 deeply


appreciate
 it.
 Again,
 for
 the
 couples


that
 watch,
 it
 means
 a
 ton.
 There's


another
 couple,
 Britney
 and
 Eddie,
 uh,


who
 I
 got
 to
 meet
 back
 in
 September.


they
 came
 over
 to
 the
 uh
 to
 the
 spot


and
 uh
 yeah,
 they
 were
 awesome
 as
 well.


So,
 and
 then
 you
 know
 when
 they
 told
 me


their
 routine
 and
 they
 told
 me
 that
 they


literally
 like
 wake
 up
 and
 they
 watch


the
 show
 together,
 it's
 like
 it's
 just


so
 crazy
 that
 you
 know
 you're
 part
 of


someone's
 life
 like
 that.
 But
 yeah,


there's
 Britney
 and
 Eddie.
 Shout
 out
 to


them.
 OG
 OG
 hood
 supporters
 and
 uh
 very


very
 grateful
 for
 all
 of
 them
 being
 part


of
 the
 show.


Okay.
 Uh
 we
 got
 like
 10
 left.
 Here
 we


go.
 Uh,
 Deepen,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 50


super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 M.
 Someone


said
 earlier,
 you
 cannot
 take
 a
 day
 off


now
 that
 you
 have
 become
 a
 big
 part
 of


our
 lives.
 Been
 with
 you
 since
 9,000


subs.
 Looking
 forward
 to
 the
 UK
 meetup.


Best
 wishes.


Yeah,
 again,
 I
 I
 I
 also
 uh
 I
 I
 I
 hate


taking
 days
 off,
 but
 taking
 Friday
 off


and
 the
 the
 backlash
 from
 that
 also


showed
 me
 how
 much
 uh
 you
 know,
 I
 don't


I
 don't
 want
 to
 take
 days
 off
 because
 I


want
 to
 be
 consistent
 and
 be
 be
 part
 of


everyone's
 routine.
 So,
 I
 just
 got
 to


make
 sure
 I
 don't
 get
 sick.
 And
 look,


could
 I
 have
 could
 I
 have
 could
 I
 have


really
 pushed
 through
 on
 Friday?
 Maybe.


But
 I
 also
 I
 want
 to
 deliver
 something


of
 quality.
 And
 when
 you're
 just
 feeling


bad,
 it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 you
 don't
 want


to
 just
 get
 up
 there
 and
 [ __ ]
 it.


So,
 yeah,
 that's
 why
 that's
 why
 I


thought
 it
 might
 make
 sense
 to
 take
 off.


But
 I
 do
 agree.
 I
 mean,
 it
 really
 is
 a


responsibility
 when
 there's
 that
 many


people
 that
 care
 every
 day.
 And
 it's


also
 a
 privilege
 to
 have
 that
 many


people
 care.
 So,
 it's
 like
 you
 have
 to


balance
 the
 responsibility
 part
 of
 it


along
 with
 your
 physical
 health,
 but


also
 knowing
 that
 like
 the
 fact
 that


people
 care
 that
 much
 that
 that's
 not


something
 you
 take
 for
 granted
 by
 any


sense
 of
 the
 imagination
 and
 you
 uh
 you


try
 to
 deliver


and
 so
 we'll
 make
 sure
 to
 try
 to
 be
 here


every
 day.
 Ry
 NY
 Fishing,
 thank
 you
 for


the
 super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday.
 Busy


week,
 brother.
 Looking
 forward
 to
 it.


Going
 to
 be
 a
 busy
 week,
 dude.
 I
 think


Wednesday,
 you
 know,
 tomorrow's
 GTC,
 so


we're
 going
 to
 be
 live
 for
 GTC.
 that'll


bleed
 into
 the
 market
 close,
 uh,
 which
 I


think
 starts
 at
 1
 PM
 and
 then
 Wednesday


is
 just
 going
 to
 be
 a
 wild
 day.
 So,


yeah,
 we'll
 probably
 be
 live
 all
 day
 on


Wednesday.


Uh,
 Relatable

 worry
 about
 their


drive.
 Thank

 Rest

 Yeah,
 I
 think


we're
 gonna
 have
 to
 rest
 my
 voice
 after


these
 last
 five


and
 be
 talking
 again
 in
 like
 three
 hours


with
 Tanner
 and
 Boy,
 but
 appreciate
 you,


man.
 Steve
 was
 on
 earlier
 in
 the
 show


and
 uh
 Steve
 organized
 that
 whole


birthday
 meetup
 with
 everybody.


So
 appreciate
 Steve,
 Tanner,
 Roy,

 Happy
 birthday,
 M.
 I've


watched
 since
 May
 of
 2023
 and
 made
 a


[ __ ]
 ton
 of
 money
 during
 that
 time


thanks
 to
 you
 and
 the
 information
 that


people
 bring
 in
 every
 day.
 Love
 it.
 That


is
 the
 goal
 of
 the
 community.
 That
 is


goal
 of
 the
 chat.
 It's
 one
 of,
 you
 know,


very
 few
 communities
 that
 actually
 we


get
 to
 make
 money
 with
 at
 the
 same
 time


of
 uh
 consuming
 and
 being
 part
 of
 the


content
 every
 day.
 So,
 means
 a
 lot
 that


everyone's
 here.
 KMS
 83,
 thank
 you
 for


the
 super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 man.


I've
 been
 watching
 your
 content
 for
 over


a
 year
 now.
 I
 don't
 engage
 too
 much
 in


the
 chat,
 but
 I
 watch
 you
 religiously.


Keep
 doing
 the
 awesome
 things
 you
 do,


bro.
 KSM,
 thank
 you
 again
 for
 being
 here


and
 again
 being
 part
 of
 the
 chat.
 Ry,


thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Amit,
 why
 are


you
 gay?
 I
 tried
 to
 help
 beat
 the


allegations
 today.
 I
 only
 made
 it
 worse,


but
 uh
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat


regardless.
 Webhead,
 thanks
 for
 the
 20


super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 man.
 I've


been
 watching
 since
 the
 daily
 cabbell


and
 I've
 been
 hooked
 ever
 since.
 You've


been
 a
 calming
 and
 informative
 voice.


Keep
 up
 the
 great
 work.
 What
 you
 are


doing
 is
 incredibly
 important.
 You
 know,


I
 actually
 have
 a
 video.
 You
 know
 that


video
 that
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 show
 you


guys?


Oh
 [ __ ]
 my
 of
 course
 my
 phone's
 on
 1%.


Do
 you
 guys
 remember?


Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 pull
 it
 up.
 I
 wanted


to
 show
 this
 but
 I
 wasn't
 able
 to
 send


this
 to
 myself.
 There
 was
 a
 video
 from


the
 Daily
 Cowbell
 which
 was
 a
 show
 I


hosted
 with
 uh
 with
 Justin
 O
 and
 Tom


Nash
 for
 those
 that
 remember.
 I
 couldn't


find
 the
 exact
 clip
 of
 you
 guys
 are
 put


in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 remember
 the
 first


episode
 for
 the
 this
 was
 early
 2022
 so
 a


lot
 of
 people
 might
 not
 remember
 it
 but


the
 first
 episode
 they
 were
 testing
 me


of
 on
 if
 I
 should
 be
 the
 host
 and
 back


then
 I
 you
 know
 was
 a
 much
 smaller


YouTuber
 so
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 going
 in


line
 with
 the
 philosophy
 of
 taking


advantage
 of
 the
 moment
 I
 said
 sure
 I'll


do
 it
 Tom
 was
 like
 hey
 can
 you
 do
 the


show
 and
 I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 their
 host


got
 sick
 or
 something
 or
 something


happened
 technically
 and
 they
 were
 like


we
 need
 a
 host
 and
 they're
 can
 you
 do


it?
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 yeah,
 I'll
 do
 it.


Some
 of
 you
 guys
 remember.
 Okay.
 So,
 the


way
 I
 ended
 the
 uh
 show
 that
 day
 was
 a


certain
 sentence
 to
 and
 you
 know,
 your


boy
 your
 boy


wanted
 to
 uh
 to
 make
 a
 joke.


And
 well,
 I
 definitely
 made
 a
 joke.
 Do


Oh,
 I
 have
 it.
 I
 have
 it.
 Okay.
 So,
 is


there
 any
 way
 I
 could
 send
 this?
 Oh,
 I


know
 what
 I
 can
 do.
 I
 know
 what
 I
 can


do.
 I
 can
 actually


maybe
 I
 can


I
 want
 to
 show
 you
 the
 video,
 but
 I


don't
 want
 to
 show
 it
 on
 my
 phone.
 I


want
 to
 show
 it
 on
 Twitter.


Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 put
 it
 Oh,
 wait.
 No.


Can
 I
 just
 put
 it
 right
 here?
 Can
 I
 just


send
 it
 to
 myself?


Can't
 I
 just
 iMessage
 myself?


Yeah,
 I
 can
 just
 message
 myself.
 I
 feel


like
 I
 should
 be
 able
 to
 pull
 it
 up
 from


there.


This
 is
 I
 found
 it
 basically.
 I
 didn't


find
 the
 exact
 video,
 but
 I
 found
 me


showing
 those
 friends
 that
 I
 showed
 you


guys
 in
 the
 chat.


Uh,
 let's
 see
 if
 this
 goes
 through
 the


video


and


a
 bunch
 of
 you
 guys
 remember.
 Yeah,
 the


video
 was
 actually
 Okay,
 let's
 see
 if
 I


can
 pull
 this
 up.


Let's
 see
 if
 I
 can
 pull
 this
 up.
 The


video
 was
 pretty
 funny.
 I'll
 say
 that.


But
 it
 was
 a
 while
 ago.


Okay,
 let's
 see
 if
 this
 pulls
 up.
 Let
 me


see.


>> All right,
 so
 this
 is
 my
 first
 week.


>> Okay,
 does
 this
 pull
 up?
 Let's
 see.


Let's
 see.


No,
 it's
 not
 pulling
 up,
 bro.
 This
 is


stupid.
 Why
 is
 this
 not
 Oh,
 open
 with


QuickTime
 player.
 Okay,
 now
 it
 should


pull
 up.
 This
 QuickTime
 player.
 Boom.
 We


got
 it.
 Okay,
 cool.
 You
 guys
 should
 be


able
 to
 hear
 it.
 Let
 me
 know if
 you


can't
 hear
 it,
 but
 uh
 you
 guys
 see
 this?


Yes.
 Okay,
 so
 these
 were
 the
 three
 girls


I
 showed
 you
 guys.
 They
 were
 like
 some


of
 my
 college
 best
 friends
 and
 uh
 this


was
 back
 in
 2022.
 So
 they
 came
 over
 to


the
 house
 and
 well
 I
 showed
 them


I
 showed
 them
 the
 video
 and
 this
 is
 what


happened.
 Let
 me
 know
 if
 you
 guys
 can't


hear
 it
 but
 you
 should
 be
 able
 to
 to


hear
 it.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 this
 is
 my
 first
 week


hosting
 the


>> Wait,
 there's
 no
 sound.
 You
 couldn't


hear
 it.
 You
 couldn't
 hear
 it.


>> Wait,
 there's
 no
 sound.


>> Oh
 [ __ ]
 You
 couldn't
 hear
 it.
 You


couldn't
 hear
 it.
 Damn.


Damn.
 That
 sucks.


That
 sucks.
 The
 only
 sound
 you
 were


hearing
 initially
 was
 cuz
 my
 ca
 my
 phone


my
 uh
 my
 microphone
 wasn't
 mut
 or
 my
 my


actual


Mac
 wasn't
 muted.
 Why
 is
 the
 sound
 not


playing,
 bro?
 This
 is
 the
 problem
 with


stream.
 Oh,
 I
 didn't
 share
 the
 system


audio.
 Okay,
 I'm
 an
 idiot.
 Okay,
 that's


the
 Okay.
 All right,
 let's
 run
 it
 back.


Let's
 run
 it
 back.
 Here
 we
 go.
 Here
 we


go.
 This
 should
 work
 now.
 This
 should


work.


>> All right.
 So,
 this
 is
 my
 first
 week


hosting
 this
 new
 debate
 show.
 Uh,
 doing


very
 well.
 This
 was
 the
 ending
 to
 the


first
 episode
 I
 ever
 hosted.
 I
 This
 is


your
 raw
 reaction.
 You
 guys
 have
 never


seen
 it
 before.
 You
 guys
 ready?


>> Yep.


>> All
 right.
 Ready?
 Starting
 now.


Well,
 even
 though
 Soft
 Bank
 is
 soft,
 we


hope
 that
 us
 three
 on
 the
 screen


definitely
 made
 you
 hard
 this
 morning.


Thank
 you
 guys
 for
 watching.
 That
 was


legit,
 right?
 Talks
 with
 your
 unofficial


host.
 Admit
 I
 might
 be
 back
 tomorrow.


We'll
 see.


>> That
 was
 good,
 right?


>> They
 were
 like,


>> that
 was
 good,
 right?


>> I
 feel
 like
 that
 guy's
 being
 gassed.
 It


was
 funny,
 but
 wasn't
 like
 gas.


>> No,
 he
 Tom
 is
 laughing.
 Tom,
 that
 was


funny.
 Right,
 Tom?


>> I'm
 dying.
 That's
 so
 funny.


>> He's
 dying.
 It
 was
 amazing.


>> Like
 Tom's
 like,
 "Yeah,
 after
 that
 one,


we
 won't
 be
 seeing
 you
 again.


It
 was
 good.


>> That
 was
 That
 was
 not
 that
 bad,
 dude.


That
 was
 pretty
 good.
 And
 so
 that
 was


the
 thing
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 from
 so


long
 ago
 of
 uh
 of
 of
 of
 of
 doing
 the


show.
 And
 I
 I
 think
 there's
 actually


some
 some
 some
 some
 quite
 frankly
 I


think
 there's
 some
 there's
 some


philosophical
 takeaways
 from
 that.


Number
 one
 is
 uh
 was
 the
 joke
 a
 little


cringe
 and
 weird?
 Yes.
 But
 also,
 it's
 a


debate
 show
 at
 the
 time
 that
 was
 trying


to
 make
 the
 stock
 market
 entertaining.


And
 I
 think
 as
 a
 host,
 you
 needed
 a


little
 bit
 of
 juice
 to
 get
 people


excited.
 And
 so,
 I
 remember
 the
 comments


that
 day,
 that
 was
 the
 first
 time
 I
 was


introduced
 to
 like
 20,000
 people
 at
 once


because
 the
 episodes
 were
 getting
 like


20,000
 views
 a
 day.
 And
 um
 honestly,


bro,
 it
 was
 95%


give
 this
 guy
 a
 job,
 like
 make
 him
 the


host.
 And
 it
 was
 5%
 this
 was
 too
 cringe.


And
 I
 think
 what
 that
 taught
 me
 at
 the


moment
 was
 just
 like
 sometimes
 you
 got


to
 go
 for
 it.
 Sometimes
 you
 got
 to
 make


you you've
 got
 to
 make
 the
 joke
 and
 uh


the
 segue
 from
 SoftBank
 and
 Soft
 and


yeah,
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 runchy


joke,
 but
 the
 whole
 point
 is
 like
 that's


your
 personality
 and
 you
 want
 that


personality
 to
 kind
 of
 create
 uh
 a
 bit


of
 excitement
 at
 its
 core.
 And
 so,
 you


know,
 that
 was
 really
 important
 because


that
 that
 showed
 Tom
 and
 Justin,
 oh,


this
 guy
 like
 if
 we
 don't
 go
 with
 him


and
 we
 go
 with
 some
 boring
 host,
 it's


not
 going
 to
 be
 the
 same.
 And
 so
 you
 you


kind
 of,
 you
 know,
 sometimes
 you
 get
 an


opportunity,
 you
 have
 that
 first


impression
 and
 you
 just
 you
 take
 that


opportunity,
 you
 show
 the
 audience
 what


you
 can
 do
 and
 then
 it's
 up
 to
 life
 and


you,
 you
 know,
 let
 the
 chips
 fall
 where


they
 do.
 Uh,
 but
 that
 show
 ended
 up


having
 a
 good
 run.
 I
 think
 we
 did
 like


20
 30
 episodes
 and
 then
 eventually
 the


show
 ended.
 But
 it
 really
 a
 lot
 of
 you


guys,
 the
 reason
 I
 showed
 that
 clip
 as


well,
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 found
 me
 through


that
 show.
 Like
 those
 were
 thousands
 of


people
 like
 like
 learning
 about
 who
 I


am.
 Who
 is
 this
 emit
 guy,
 right?
 because


I,
 you
 know,
 my
 channel
 was
 growing,
 but


it
 wasn't
 grow,
 you
 know,
 it
 wasn't


growing
 at
 the
 level
 it's
 growing
 at


right
 now.
 So,
 at
 at
 that
 moment,
 you


take
 every
 single
 opportunity.
 I


remember,
 dude,
 I
 was
 still
 driving
 60


miles
 back
 and
 forth
 New
 Jersey.
 I
 had


to
 leave
 the
 house
 at
 2:30
 every
 day.


And
 one
 day,
 Tom
 is
 like,
 "Bro,
 we
 need


to
 do
 the
 show.
 We
 We
 need
 you
 as
 we


need
 you
 as
 the
 replacement."
 This
 was


before
 I
 got
 the
 full-time
 thing.
 And
 uh


by
 the
 way,
 I
 never
 got
 paid
 for
 any
 of


this
 or
 something.
 I
 was
 just
 doing
 it


because,
 you
 know,
 I
 wanted
 the


opportunity.
 And
 uh
 and
 I
 delayed
 going


to
 my
 consulting
 job
 by
 like
 an
 hour
 and


made
 up
 some
 excuse
 and
 I
 was
 just
 like


I
 had
 to
 blah
 blah
 blah
 blah
 blah
 just


because
 I
 knew
 that
 opportunity
 and


being
 there
 was
 way
 more
 important
 than


whatever
 stupid
 consulting
 job
 I
 needed


to
 do.
 I
 was
 like
 that
 [ __ ]
 does
 not


matter.
 This
 [ __ ]
 you
 know
 it's
 like


those
 tradeoffs
 of
 life.
 You
 look
 at
 it


back
 and
 forth
 and
 you're
 just
 like
 it's


all
 part
 of
 the
 journey.
 I'm
 sure
 so


many
 of
 you
 have
 had
 that
 opportunity


where
 you
 know
 you've
 had
 to
 make
 a


decision.
 you'd
 have
 to
 take
 an
 L


because
 I
 didn't
 get
 paid
 for
 that
 hour.


I
 was
 getting
 paid
 by
 the
 hour.
 I
 did


not
 get
 paid
 for
 that
 hour
 because
 I
 was


late.
 Um,
 but
 you
 know,
 the
 opportunity


was
 more
 important.
 So,
 wow.
 30.85,


dude.
 Someone's
 B.
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 it's


just
 low
 volume
 ALOS
 or
 someone's
 buying


before
 earnings.
 By
 the
 way,
 Google
 270


as
 well.


Google
 not
 slowing
 down.
 And
 then
 you


got
 SoFi
 continuing
 to
 move
 after
 hours.


This
 is
 gonna
 be
 fun.
 It's
 gonna
 be
 fun


for
 SoFi.
 We're
 gonna
 see.
 All right.


So,
 that
 was
 the
 video.
 That
 was
 the


video.
 I
 I
 would
 have
 showed
 you
 just


the
 video
 itself,
 but
 uh
 the
 only
 way
 I


found
 the
 video
 because
 the
 show
 is
 not


online
 anymore
 is
 that
 video
 of
 me


recording
 their
 reaction
 to
 a
 video.


And
 so,
 there
 you
 go.
 All
 right,
 last


few
 super
 chats.
 Basu
 Games,
 thank
 you


for
 the
 super
 chat.
 You've
 motivated
 me


to
 wake
 up
 every
 day
 at
 8:45
 a.m.
 I
 love


it.
 I
 love
 it.
 That's
 awesome.
 You
 know,


I
 I
 think
 waking
 up
 early
 really
 is
 a


life
 hack.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 just
 helps


organize
 your
 mind
 every
 day
 when
 you


wake
 up
 early.
 So,
 I'm
 a
 deep
 deep


believer.
 And
 I
 I
 usually
 wasn't
 a


morning
 person,
 but
 you
 know,
 once
 I


started
 doing
 the
 show,
 I
 was
 like,


dude,
 I
 got
 to
 be
 up
 early
 to
 get
 ready,


but
 more
 importantly,
 I
 got
 to
 be
 up


early
 to
 start
 the
 day.
 Like,
 it's


another
 day.
 You're
 alive
 on
 planet


Earth.
 You
 are
 alive
 on
 planet
 Earth.


That
 in
 and
 of
 itself
 should
 be
 enough


to
 be
 like,
 let
 me
 get
 my
 ass
 out
 of
 bed


and
 deal
 with
 all
 the
 [ __ ]
 I
 have
 to


deal
 with,
 but
 still
 I
 get
 a
 chance
 to


live
 another
 day.


And
 so
 that's
 kind
 of
 how
 I
 uh
 adjusted


my
 mindset
 on
 that.
 Uh
 Mucer,
 thank
 you


for
 the
 $28
 super ship
 chat.
 Thanks.
 You


have
 convinced
 uh
 in
 you
 have
 helped
 me


with
 pound
 my
 way
 to
 financial


independence.
 Incredible.
 Thank
 you
 for


being
 here
 and
 congrats
 on
 pounder


again.
 Alltime
 highs
 today
 was
 super


awesome
 to
 see
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 the


company
 keeps
 executing.
 Yeah.
 By
 the


way
 guys,
 speaking
 of
 pounder,
 I
 mean


Arie
 texted
 me
 the
 other
 day
 and
 um
 if


we'll
 be
 making
 it
 rain
 at
 the
 strip


club
 tonight.
 Arie
 texted
 me
 the
 other


day
 and
 he
 was
 like,
 "Bro,
 I
 don't
 think


I
 could
 do
 Pounder
 Weekly
 anymore."
 And


I
 was
 like, "I
 understand.
 Like,
 we


haven't
 done
 Pounder
 Weekly
 in
 a
 month


and
 a
 half."
 And
 uh
 I
 talked
 to
 some
 of


the
 other
 guys
 and
 they
 were
 like,


"Yeah,
 man.
 Just
 not
 feeling
 it."
 I
 I
 I


think
 I
 think
 quite
 frankly,
 there's


just
 not
 there's
 not
 enough
 need
 to
 do
 a


weekly
 episode
 on
 Palantra
 anymore.
 Like


the
 company's
 on
 autopilot.
 The
 reason


for
 the
 podcast
 back
 then
 was
 because


there
 was
 so
 much
 news
 to
 break
 down
 and


dissect
 and
 there
 was
 so
 much
 mystery


and
 mystique
 around
 the
 company.
 and
 now


it's
 just
 like,
 you
 know,
 that
 that
 that


doesn't
 exist
 anymore.
 So,
 we're
 still


going
 to
 be
 doing
 the
 earning
 streams


for
 sure.
 Obviously,
 I
 will
 still
 talk


about
 Pounder
 and
 the
 daily
 recaps,
 but


it's
 really
 hard
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 people


to
 commit
 their
 time,
 especially
 the


Europeans
 who,
 you
 know,
 live
 on
 a


different
 time
 zone,
 to
 sit
 down
 and


talk
 about
 a
 company
 that
 they
 already


know
 about
 and
 that
 there's
 just
 no
 need


for
 them
 to
 reiterate
 the
 same
 thing


they've
 been
 saying
 for
 three
 years.


So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 I
 don't
 really
 know


if
 we're
 gonna
 have
 poucher.
 He
 might


still
 do
 the
 pouncer
 monthly
 thing,
 but


it's
 just
 again,
 you
 have
 to
 be


motivated
 to
 do
 content.
 And
 Arie
 at


this
 point
 is
 just
 like,
 you
 know,


Arie's
 traveling.
 He's
 doing
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 things.
 Arie's
 also
 a
 couple


years
 older
 than
 me,
 so
 he's
 trying
 to


do
 different,
 you
 know,
 things
 of
 his


life.
 And
 for
 him
 to
 commit
 that
 every


week,
 there's
 just
 not
 enough
 to
 talk


about
 to
 be
 so,
 you
 know,
 convinced
 in


it.
 So,
 we'll
 still
 do
 the
 earnings


preview.
 We'll
 still
 do
 the
 earnings


like
 episodes,
 all
 that
 stuff,
 but
 it's


just
 like
 the
 weekly
 cadence
 of
 it
 is


just
 not
 going
 to
 be
 needed
 as
 much,
 you


know,
 given
 the
 company
 has
 executed
 at


the
 level
 that
 they've
 they've
 executed


at.
 Same
 with
 Hood.
 Well,
 there
 is
 no


Hood
 Weekly
 as
 per
 the
 lawyers.
 But
 no,


but
 so
 because
 it's
 Tech
 Bros
 and
 not


Hood
 anymore,
 you
 know,
 Tanner
 Roy
 and
 I


can
 probably
 talk
 about
 anything
 instead


of
 just
 Robin
 Hood
 because
 if
 it
 was


just
 Hood
 Weekly,
 dude,
 we
 wouldn't
 have


much
 to
 talk
 about
 today
 because
 there's


there
 wasn't
 that
 much
 news
 last
 week


for
 Robin
 Hood.
 That's
 why
 even
 SoFi


Weekly
 turned
 into
 like
 fintech
 weekly


because
 you
 just
 need
 other
 topics,


right?
 And
 at
 some
 point
 if
 the


company's
 executing
 there's
 just
 like


what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 analyze
 if
 there's


not
 that
 much
 to
 break
 down.
 So


yeah,
 that's
 that's
 that's
 probably
 how


we're
 thinking
 about
 it.
 Wow.
 So
 she's


moving
 30.90.


Dude,
 either
 tomorrow
 we're
 going
 to


wake
 up
 and
 be
 happy
 or
 we're
 going
 to


have
 a
 massive
 red
 candle
 and
 it's
 going


to
 be
 a
 sell
 the
 news.
 It's
 literally


one
 of
 the
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 flat.
 I


think
 it's
 35
 or
 like
 26.
 I
 think
 that's


that's
 the
 range.
 What
 is
 the
 implied


move?
 Does
 anyone
 have
 the
 IV
 on
 this
 or


the
 implied
 volatility?


I
 think
 I
 saw
 it
 was
 like
 5.3%.
 Maybe


maybe
 it's
 more
 than
 that.


It
 wouldn't
 surprise
 me
 if
 it's
 closer


to
 10%.
 So
 tends
 to
 be
 super
 volatile
 on


earnings,


but
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 what
 we


get
 in
 the
 morning.
 12%.
 Okay.
 Wow.
 12%


that
 means
 bro
 that
 is
 I
 mean
 12%
 from


these
 levels
 that
 means
 we're
 looking
 at


either
 35


or
 yeah
 basically
 what
 I
 said
 or


or
 2650


so
 20
 call
 it
 26
 to
 35
 that's
 what
 we're


looking
 at
 on
 uh
 on
 soi


okay
 cool
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 on
 soi
 Nick

 "I

You
 are
 always
 in

 background
 on
 my

 in

 in
 my

The

 are
 off.


Appreciate

 Nick.
 Thank
 you
 for


having
 me
 wherever
 you're
 watching
 me


across

 uh
 across

There
 you
 go.
 I
 think
 we
 got
 through
 all


of
 it.
 I
 think
 we
 got
 through
 all
 of
 it.


ET,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $10
 super
 chat.
 Um


I
 guess
 you
 mean
 you're
 paying
 you're


helping
 pay
 for
 the
 utility
 bill,
 so


I'll
 take
 the
 $10
 and
 pay
 for
 the


utilities.
 ET
 has
 been
 watching
 for
 so


long.
 He's
 been
 here
 since
 like
 2022.


So,
 deeply
 appreciate
 you
 being
 part
 of


the
 channel,
 man.
 And
 uh
 thank
 you
 for


your


well,
 not
 only
 your
 comments,
 but
 also


your
 jokes.
 You
 have
 been
 one
 of
 the


funniest
 people
 in
 the
 chat,
 and
 you


know
 how
 funny
 you
 are.
 So,
 appreciate


you
 being
 here
 every
 single
 day.
 So,


53087.
 Wow,
 Google's
 still
 moving
 as


well.
 270.


Dude,
 Google's
 a
 I
 mean,
 if
 we
 see
 a


three
 handle
 on
 Google
 by
 end
 of
 year,


what
 an
 that
 means
 it
 would
 have
 doubled


in
 four
 months
 after
 being
 stuck
 at
 150


for
 nine
 months.
 I
 mean,
 the
 Google


bulls
 deserve
 all
 the
 credit
 in
 the


world
 if
 this
 thing
 actually
 makes
 its


way
 to
 300
 by
 end
 of
 year.


So,
 that
 would
 be
 awesome.


Yeah,
 ET
 is
 an
 OG.
 Same
 thing
 with
 June.


June,
 I
 love
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 She's
 been
 watching
 the
 channel


for
 four
 years.
 to
 all
 the
 mods.
 Ray,


Michelle,
 June,
 Tess,
 Austin,
 Matt,


Douggee,
 Spencer,
 I'm
 Benny,
 I
 mean,
 all


you
 guys
 have
 just
 uh
 Eddie,
 it
 it's


just
 meant
 the
 world.
 Cactus,
 Jack,


obviously,
 now
 we're
 working
 more


together.
 So,
 it's
 awesome
 to
 have


Cactus
 here
 and,
 you
 know,
 actually
 help


every
 single
 day
 to
 to
 really
 make
 this


happen.
 Dragos,
 I
 mean,
 all
 you
 guys


means
 a
 lot,
 dude.
 It
 means
 a
 lot.
 And


one
 thing
 I
 I
 haven't
 said
 this
 publicly


yet.
 Well,
 maybe
 I
 did
 say
 this


publicly.
 I
 don't
 know if
 I
 did,
 but
 um


one
 of
 the
 goals
 of
 the


one
 of
 the
 goals
 of
 the
 um
 of
 the


meetups
 is
 we're
 going
 to
 try
 to
 create


a
 fund
 with
 the
 the
 meetup
 money
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 try
 to
 get
 as
 many
 mods
 as
 I


can
 get
 to
 the
 meetups
 because
 in
 Miami


the
 vibe
 was
 just
 so
 much
 better
 when


you
 have
 all
 these
 people
 that
 are
 part


of
 the
 meetups.
 And
 um
 yeah,
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 fly
 out
 every
 single


mod,
 but
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 want
 to
 be
 able


to,
 you
 know,
 if
 Doug
 can
 make
 it,
 if


Michelle
 can
 if
 all
 you
 if
 if
 at least


five
 or
 six
 of
 you
 guys
 can
 make
 it
 uh


to
 the
 meetup,
 then
 I
 think
 it
 would
 be


a
 great
 experience
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 you


guys
 in
 the
 chat
 know
 the
 mods
 because


they're
 there
 every
 day.
 And
 um
 you


know,
 it
 just
 it
 just
 makes
 it
 a
 more


brighter
 experience
 when
 you
 have
 a
 lot


more
 people
 there
 that
 everyone
 already


knows.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 try
 to
 get
 the


mods
 to
 as
 many
 meetups
 as
 possible.


Some
 of
 them
 probably
 won't
 be
 able
 to


come
 if
 it's
 too
 far
 away,
 but
 for
 the


ones
 that
 can't
 make
 it,
 uh,
 I'm
 going


to
 try
 to
 take
 care
 of
 that
 and
 make


sure
 they're
 there
 and
 have
 a
 good
 time.


So,


Ray
 says,
 "Mattie
 is
 actually
 flying
 us


all
 out."
 Dude,
 Maddie
 can
 afford
 to
 fly


out
 all
 2,000
 people
 in
 the
 chat
 to


freaking


come
 to
 these
 meetups.


I
 still
 don't
 know
 why
 Matt
 money
 is


working.
 He
 just
 he
 just
 loves
 stacking


more
 dollar
 bills
 on
 top
 of
 his
 dollar


bills.
 But


yeah,
 hopefully
 we
 can
 get
 Matt
 to
 a


bunch
 of
 these
 meetups
 as
 well.
 You


know,
 Matt
 is
 actually
 the
 the
 one
 of


the
 number
 one
 people
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 you


guys
 have
 told
 me
 you
 got
 to
 speak
 to
 at


the
 Miami
 meetup
 and
 that
 you
 love


speaking
 to
 was
 Matt
 Money.
 And
 a
 lot
 of


you
 guys
 know
 him
 because
 he
 has
 his
 own


channel
 and
 you
 watch
 his
 content
 as


well.
 But
 there's
 a
 ton
 of
 you
 guys
 that


are
 like,
 "Dude,
 Matt
 was
 awesome.
 It


was
 so
 cool
 to
 meet
 him
 in
 person
 and


talk
 to
 him."
 And
 he's
 a
 great
 guy.
 He's


a
 great
 great
 guy.
 So,
 it's
 really
 fun


to
 to
 make
 this
 happen
 in
 person.


All
 right.
 Cool.
 That's
 what
 we
 got.
 Uh,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 long
 week.
 Tomorrow


we're
 starting
 at
 7:25.


7:25.


What's
 the
 over
 under?
 You
 think
 Steve's


gonna
 wake
 up
 and
 be
 on
 time?
 I'm
 I'm


saying
 I'm
 saying
 no.
 I
 think
 Steve's


gonna
 be
 late.
 Steve
 was
 talking
 to
 me


over
 the
 weekend.
 And
 Steve
 was
 like


Steve
 was
 like,
 um,
 Steve
 was
 like,


"Dude,
 I
 don't
 know if
 I'm
 going
 to
 wake


up
 on
 time."
 I
 was
 like, "I
 He's
 like,
 I


can't
 get
 up
 at
 6:30."
 I
 was like, "No,


we're
 going to
 go
 live
 at
 like
 7:25."


He's
 like, "Okay,
 maybe
 that's
 more


reasonable.
 I
 still
 think
 he
 might
 not


be
 able
 to
 make
 it.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to


see
 if
 Steve
 will
 be
 up
 with
 us.
 Um,
 but


we're
 already
 starting
 at
 7:25.
 We
 got


SoFi,
 PayPal,
 and
 UNH.
 SoFi
 earnings
 are


at
 7
 a.m.
 I
 will
 not
 be
 live
 from
 7
 to


7:25
 Eastern.
 Yes,
 Eastern.
 So,
 for


those
 that
 want
 the
 immediate
 coverage


on
 SoFi
 numbers,
 Tanner,
 Tanner
 is
 the


guy
 you
 go
 to.
 And
 then
 if
 you
 want


Steve
 and
 I's
 take
 at
 7,
 basically
 7:30,


we'll
 be
 live
 and
 uh
 and
 we
 will
 break


down
 the
 numbers
 the
 best
 that
 we
 can.


8:00
 PM
 or
 8
 a.m.
 will
 be
 the
 call.
 By


the
 way,
 Tanner's
 channel
 right
 there
 in


the
 chat,
 so
 you
 guys
 can
 subscribe
 to


him
 there.
 He'll
 be
 live
 early
 morning.


Uh
 88
 8
 uh
 a.m.
 will
 be
 not
 on
 the
 call.


So
 from
 7:25
 to
 8,
 we're
 going
 to


analyze
 the
 numbers.
 Hopefully
 the
 stock


is
 moving
 in
 the
 right
 direction.


8
 am
 we'll
 listen
 to
 the
 call.
 Call
 will


be
 done


probably.
 I
 mean
 call
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be


done
 till
 9.
 My
 channel
 is
 definitely


not
 going
 to
 listen
 to
 the
 whole
 thing


because
 it's
 going
 to
 get
 boring
 at
 some


point
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 look
 at
 the


other
 news.
 So
 we're
 going
 to
 probably


cut
 it
 off
 at
 like
 8:45ish.


Uh
 and
 then
 we'll
 get
 into
 the
 market


news
 and
 then
 we'll
 take
 a
 look
 at


PayPal
 and
 UNH.


So
 we
 have
 tons
 and
 tons
 and
 tons
 of


coverage
 tomorrow.
 We're
 not
 going
 to


have
 technical
 Tuesday
 tomorrow.


Uh
 Jason
 also
 he
 he's
 not
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 make
 it.
 He's
 busy
 doing
 a
 lot


of
 stuff,
 but
 we
 said
 last
 week
 we


weren't
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 it.
 Next


week
 on
 Tuesday
 we'll
 do
 it
 and
 then


we'll
 have
 all
 the
 earnings.
 So
 we'll


have
 you
 know
 about
 70%
 of
 the
 S&P
 500


done
 so
 that
 the
 technical
 analysis
 will


actually
 make
 more
 sense.
 Very
 like
 you


can't
 do
 TA
 on
 Google
 before
 Google


report.
 It
 just
 doesn't
 make
 sense
 to
 do


it
 tomorrow.
 So
 we'll
 uh
 we'll
 have


Jason
 on
 next
 week.
 And
 then
 uh
 we
 have


GTC.
 Oh
 [ __ ]
 I
 might
 not
 be
 able
 to


stream.
 A
 damn.


Oh
 [ __ ]
 Okay,


I
 have
 the
 dentist
 at
 11:30.


Damn,
 I
 might
 not
 be
 able
 to
 do
 GTC.


Okay,
 I'm
 gonna
 have
 to
 figure
 this
 out.


I'm
 gonna
 have
 to
 figure
 this
 out.
 If
 GT


Does
 anyone
 know
 what
 time
 GTC
 is?


If
 it's
 at
 one,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 stream
 it
 or
 I'm
 gonna
 have
 to
 cancel


on
 the
 dentist.


And
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 cancel
 on
 the


dentist.
 I
 mean,


the
 dentist
 is
 beautiful.
 I
 don't
 How


would
 I
 cancel
 on
 a
 beautiful
 woman?


That's
 not
 like
 that's
 I
 don't
 But
 GTC


is
 going
 to
 be
 important,
 bro.
 It's


Nvidia.


I
 might
 have
 to
 tell
 her.


Got
 something
 else
 to
 do,
 bro.
 I
 got


something
 else
 to
 do.


Okay,
 we'll
 see.
 I'll
 call
 them
 up
 after


this
 and
 see
 what
 open
 slots
 they
 have.


But
 yeah,
 so
 then
 it'll
 be
 GTC
 probably


at
 like
 1
 p.m.
 And
 uh
 and
 then
 after


that
 we
 have
 market
 close.
 We
 got
 a


bunch
 of
 earnings
 tomorrow
 on
 the
 market


close
 as
 well.
 Tons
 of
 different


earnings.
 So
 we
 have
 uh
 Visa,
 big


company,
 Cheesecake,
 EA
 Sports,


Manderles,
 Bookings,
 NPhase,
 Stargate,
 I


mean
 we
 got
 a
 ton
 of
 companies
 reporting


after
 the
 bell
 in
 the
 morning.
 You
 have


UPS,
 next
 era,
 UNH,
 PayPal,
 obviously


SoFi,
 Royal
 Caribbean,
 DHI,
 Home


Builder,
 Sherman
 Williams.
 So
 you
 got
 a


lot
 of
 companies
 tomorrow
 that
 we'll
 be


taking
 a
 look
 at
 and
 analyzing


throughout
 the
 day.


Dude,
 everyone's
 saying
 screw
 the


dentist,
 bro.
 Damn
 you
 guys.
 It's
 at


12:00
 p.m.


I'm
 gonna
 have
 to
 cancel.
 My


appointment's
 at
 11:30.


I'm
 gonna
 have
 to
 cancel.


Dude,
 GTC
 is
 like,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 going


to
 be
 an
 important
 GTC.
 Also,
 they're


going to
 be
 in
 DC.
 Like,
 this
 is
 not
 a


GTC
 I'd
 want
 to
 miss,
 especially
 as
 an


Nvidia
 shareholder.
 This
 is
 one
 that
 I


would
 want
 to
 actually
 keep
 track
 of.


Yeah,
 I
 can't
 miss
 you.
 All
 right.
 So,


I'll
 tell
 the
 dentist,
 you
 know,
 it's


not
 you,
 it's
 me.
 And
 uh


that's
 that's
 what
 I'm
 gonna
 have
 to


say.


That's
 Did
 you
 just
 say
 screw
 the


dentist?
 Yes,
 I
 did.


Your
 minds
 are
 all
 very
 dirty,
 but
 I
 did


say
 that.
 So,
 anyway,
 if
 you
 want


Tanner's
 coverage
 in
 the
 morning


directly
 at
 7
 am,
 here's
 his
 channel.


you
 can
 uh
 join
 as
 soon
 as
 SoFi
 numbers


come
 out.
 I
 think
 Tanner
 will
 probably


be
 live
 five
 minutes
 before
 the
 numbers


come
 out.
 So,
 as
 soon
 as
 the
 numbers


come
 out,
 I
 would
 recommend
 being
 there


with
 Tanner
 and
 you'll
 get
 immediate


coverage
 from
 him.
 And
 then
 if
 you
 want


more
 broader
 coverage
 with
 Sofi,
 we'll


be
 live
 on
 the
 market
 open
 tomorrow


starting
 around
 7:30.


I'm
 sorry,
 Aids
 Dentist.
 I'm
 sorry.


It's
 It's
 Jensen,
 bro.
 It's
 Jensen.
 We


got
 GTC.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Is
 there
 anything


else?
 I
 think
 that's
 it.
 And
 then


Wednesday,
 we
 uh
 W
 I
 think
 Wednesday
 I'm


going to
 be
 live
 all
 day
 to
 be
 honest.
 I


think
 Wednesday's
 going
 to
 be
 live
 all


day.
 So,
 we'll
 see
 what
 we
 do
 Wednesday,


but
 Wednesday
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 massive


day.
 Jose
 is
 going
 to
 be
 on
 and
 Couch


Investor
 will
 be
 on
 for
 the
 close
 on


Wednesday
 uh
 with
 Google,
 Meta,


Microsoft.
 So,
 we'll
 have
 a
 full
 house


ready
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 madness


trying
 to
 analyze
 all
 the
 numbers,
 but


it'll
 be
 a
 big
 one
 and
 we'll
 try
 to
 do


what
 we
 can
 do.


Okay,
 cool.


That
 is
 it.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 Means
 the
 world.
 Thank


you.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.


Thank
 you
 for
 the
 birthday
 wishes.
 Um
 if


you
 DM'd
 or
 sent
 a
 text
 message,
 I'm


trying
 to
 respond
 to
 everybody.
 But
 I


deeply
 appreciate
 those
 that
 reached


out.
 Again,
 you
 do
 not
 need
 to.
 Uh
 the


fact
 that
 so
 many
 people
 even
 care


about,
 you
 know,
 a
 birthday
 is
 like
 it's


it's
 it's it's
 it's
 something
 I'm
 very


very
 very
 grateful
 for.
 I
 do
 not
 take
 it


for
 granted.
 uh
 strangers
 across
 the


world
 who
 who
 even
 take
 time
 out
 of


their
 day
 to
 wish
 me
 a
 happy
 birthday.


It's
 like
 no
 one
 needs
 to
 do
 that.
 And


so
 the
 fact
 that
 people
 do
 that
 uh
 you


know
 that
 that
 is
 something
 I
 I
 really


intern
 erally
 am
 grateful
 for.
 And
 you


know
 my
 mom
 when
 I
 was
 growing
 up
 always


made
 sure
 birthdays
 were
 special.
 As


I've
 gotten
 older,
 you
 know,
 it's
 not


there's
 not
 that
 much
 of
 an
 emphasis
 on


your
 birthday
 being
 as
 special
 because


you
 just
 you
 just
 don't
 need
 to
 have


that
 emphasis.
 But
 when
 I
 was
 younger


and
 you
 know
 I
 was
 living
 at
 home
 and
 uh


it
 would
 be
 like
 my
 10th
 birthday,
 11th


birthday,
 she
 would
 she
 would
 have
 the


same
 routine.
 She
 would
 she
 would
 come


in
 the
 morning,
 she
 would
 wake
 me
 up
 and


she
 would
 sing
 happy
 birthday
 and
 give


me
 a
 hug
 while
 I
 was
 in
 bed.
 And
 uh
 you


know
 it's
 it's
 like
 to
 go
 from
 that
 in


those
 younger
 years
 to
 now
 celebrating


it
 with
 thousands
 of
 strangers
 because


of
 the
 community
 that's
 been
 built.
 It's


just
 it's
 it's
 the
 journey
 of
 a


lifetime.
 It
 really
 really
 is
 the


journey
 of
 a
 lifetime.
 And
 really,
 you


know,
 I've
 been
 doing
 a
 lot
 more
 2026


planning.
 I
 think
 2026
 is
 just
 going
 to


be
 crazier.
 Like
 I
 don't
 know
 what's


going
 to
 happen
 with
 the
 stock
 market.


I'm
 hoping
 it's
 another
 bull
 market


year,
 but
 even
 if
 it's
 not,
 I
 think
 from


a
 content
 perspective,
 which
 obviously


it
 helps
 content
 if
 the
 markets
 are


going
 up,
 but
 even
 without
 that,
 uh
 I


think
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of


different
 elements
 of
 the
 channel
 that


we're
 going to
 bring
 up.
 And
 you
 know,
 I


kind
 of
 had
 this
 vision
 going
 into
 2025,


but
 2025,
 I
 think,
 was
 more
 of
 me
 like


solidifying
 the
 market
 open,
 market


close
 every
 day.
 Like
 really


establishing
 what
 is
 this
 product?
 What


is
 the
 value
 of
 it?
 how
 consistent
 can


you
 be
 and
 how
 much
 value
 can
 you


deliver
 every
 single
 day?
 And
 I
 think
 I


I I
 think
 it's
 safe
 to
 say
 to
 myself


that,
 you
 know,
 that
 there's
 been
 a


level
 of
 work
 put
 into
 really
 making


this
 something
 that
 I
 care
 about
 doing


every
 single
 day.
 So,
 for
 2026,
 I'm


thinking
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 different


diversified
 ways
 of
 of
 content
 and


media.
 And
 uh
 there's
 just
 a
 lot
 of


ideas
 that
 I'm
 excited
 for
 and
 I
 think


we
 can
 take
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 to
 the
 next


level.


If
 it's
 a
 bare
 market,
 it'll
 be
 the
 year


of
 therapy.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 if
 it
 if


if
 it
 if
 it
 if if
 the
 S&P
 is
 down
 20%


next
 year,
 which
 look,
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 happening
 given
 the
 earnings


growth,
 you
 can
 give
 me
 all
 your
 macro


reasons
 and
 bubble
 this,
 bubble
 that,


but
 like
 if
 Google's
 putting
 up
 a


hundred
 something
 billion
 in
 net
 income,


I
 I
 don't
 really
 think
 we
 have
 to
 have
 a


20%
 draw
 down.
 But
 if
 we
 do,
 we're
 all


going
 to
 deal
 with
 it
 together
 and
 we'll


all
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 navigate
 and
 uh


deal
 with
 the
 markets
 whether
 they're
 up


or
 down.
 And
 that's
 the
 that's
 the
 cool


part
 of
 this
 community.
 So,


there
 you
 go.
 Thank
 everybody.
 SoFi

 its
