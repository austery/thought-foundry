Canada
 has
 a
 peculiar
 problem.
 We're


exceptionally
 good
 at
 creating


worldchanging
 AI
 research
 and


exceptionally
 bad
 at
 keeping
 the


economic
 benefits
 of
 that
 research.


We're
 like
 a
 high-end
 talent
 factory


with
 a
 massive
 export
 problem.
 But


here's
 the
 twist.
 Recent
 geopolitical


shifts
 might
 have
 just
 handed
 us
 an


unexpected
 opportunity
 to
 flip
 the


script.
 Welcome
 to
 episode
 4
 of
 my


series
 AI
 Hype
 Versus
 Reality,
 where
 I


dissect
 actual
 facts
 from
 noise.
 And


today
 we're
 looking
 at
 Canada's
 AI
 brain


drain.
 Is
 it
 as
 bad
 as
 the
 headlines


suggest
 or
 are
 we
 missing
 something


important?
 Case
 in
 point.
 Let's
 start


with
 what
 Canada
 gets
 right.
 And
 trust


me,
 there
 is
 a
 lot.
 Canada
 is
 undeniably


a
 powerhouse
 in
 AI
 research.
 Often


ranking
 in
 the
 top
 three
 to
 four


countries
 for
 AI
 research
 and
 academic


achievements
 in
 2025.
 Canada
 has
 had


major
 breakthroughs
 in
 AI,
 worldclass


talent
 and
 noteworthy
 applications


across
 multiple
 sectors.

are
 really
 the
 core
 reason
 we're
 able
 to


use
 LLMs
 like
 GBT,

 Gemini
 or

 today.
 Canada
 also
 takes
 pride
 in


some
 notable
 achievements
 in
 AI


architectures.

 including
 Aiden

co-authored
 the
 influential
 2017
 paper


on

 architecture.
 In


case
 you
 haven't
 heard
 about
 it,
 this
 is


one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 scientific


papers
 of
 the
 decade.
 Anyone
 who
 works


with
 machine
 learning
 will
 tell
 you
 how


fundamental
 transformers
 have
 become
 to


today's
 machine
 learning.
 Richard

 the
 University
 of

 across

 achieved

advances
 in

 which


marked
 a

 in

 The
 practical
 AI


applications
 are
 impressive
 too.

 and


worldclass

 hubs
 like
 the
 Vector


Institute
 in
 Toronto,
 Mila
 in
 Montreal


and
 Alberta
 Machine
 intelligence


institute
 in
 Edmonton.
 I
 spoke
 about


this
 in
 my
 very
 first
 video
 about
 Canada


and
 I
 would
 like
 to
 highlight
 it
 again.


Canada
 has
 a
 very
 strong
 academic
 and


intellectual
 potential.
 I
 think
 that


Canada
 doesn't
 have
 a
 very
 strong


marketing
 as
 a
 country,
 but
 it's
 like


that
 one
 quiet
 nerdy
 kid
 sitting
 at
 the


very
 back
 who
 knows
 answers
 to
 every


single
 question.
 Now,
 how
 has
 public
 and


academic
 funding
 shaped
 the
 type
 of
 AI


research
 conducted
 in
 Canada?
 Canada
 is


known
 for
 fundamental
 and
 academic
 AI


research.
 This
 is
 important.
 Not


commercialization
 that
 brings
 us
 a
 ton


of
 money,
 but
 academic
 research.
 In


2017,
 Canada
 launched
 the
 panadian
 AI


strategy
 that
 prioritizes
 academic


research
 by
 supporting
 renowned


institutes
 such
 as
 Mila
 in
 Montreal,


Vector
 Institute
 in
 Toronto,
 and
 Alberta


Machine
 Intelligence.
 This
 was
 the
 first


program
 of
 its
 kind
 globally,
 which


expanded
 in
 the
 recent
 years,
 investing


over
 $2
 billion
 since
 inception.
 This


was
 followed
 by
 an
 additional
 $2.4
 4


billion
 commitment
 in
 2024.
 Here's
 the


thing.
 Canada
 has
 the
 privilege
 of
 being


able
 to
 afford
 curiositydriven
 research.


Research
 driven
 by
 questions
 about


foundational
 principles
 and
 hypothetical


possibilities
 rather
 than
 immediate


market
 or
 industry
 needs.
 Now,
 why
 do
 I


call
 it
 a
 privilege?
 Because
 for
 many


folks
 working
 in
 academia,
 the
 ability


to
 work
 on
 things
 that
 they
 read
 in


sci-fi
 books
 about
 is
 a
 dream
 come
 true.


Not
 every
 country
 can
 afford
 to
 give


that
 possibility
 and
 opportunity
 to


scientists.
 Canadian
 scientists
 work
 on


long-term
 foundational
 AI
 problems,


foundational
 algorithms,
 mathematical


proofs,
 studying
 properties
 of
 learning


systems,
 often
 without
 a
 specific


commercial
 strategy
 in
 mind.
 The


majority
 of
 public
 funding
 through


federal
 agencies
 has
 historically
 gone


to
 basic
 research,
 student
 training,
 and


professional
 research
 chairs.
 Sounds


pretty
 great,
 right?
 Well,
 here's
 where


things
 get
 interesting.
 There
 is
 one


fundamental
 problem
 with
 this
 type
 of
 AI


specialization.
 This
 research
 doesn't


fully
 translate
 into
 opportunities
 and


money
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 it
 needs
 to.


Don't
 get
 me
 wrong,
 I'm
 not
 making


sweeping
 generalizations.
 Things
 are


happening,
 but
 there
 is
 a
 glaring
 gap


between
 Canada's
 exceptional
 potential


as
 an
 AI
 research
 leader
 and
 the
 scale


of
 its
 domestic
 and
 most
 importantly


international
 commercialization,


particularly
 compared
 to
 the
 United


States.
 Let's
 understand
 why.
 Canada's


inability
 to
 fully
 translate
 world-class


AI
 research
 into
 largecale
 commercial


success
 isn't
 a
 single
 failing.
 It's
 a


tangle
 of
 structural,
 cultural,
 and


historic
 problems.
 Here's
 some


historical
 context.
 Canadian
 tech
 and
 AI


research
 have
 been
 deeply
 rooted
 in


academia
 since
 the
 post-war
 era.


Canadian
 governments
 poured
 resources


into
 universities
 and
 fundamental


research,
 and
 they
 did
 create


world-class
 research
 hubs,
 but
 not


equally
 robust
 pathways
 to
 market.
 This


fostered
 a
 culture
 where
 research


excellence
 and
 publications
 were


prioritized
 over
 building
 products
 or


companies.
 Technology
 transfer


processes,
 moving
 innovation
 from
 lab
 to


market,
 were
 slow,
 bureaucratic,
 and


often
 dep
 prioritized.
 Canadian


universities
 develop
 technology
 transfer


offices
 decades
 after
 the
 US
 peers
 and


are
 frequently
 described
 as
 ill
 adapted


to
 quick
 pivots
 necessary
 to
 take
 an


idea
 from
 market
 to
 scale
 it.
 Unlike
 the


US
 where
 major
 government
 contracts


provide
 vital
 runway
 for
 new
 cutting


edge
 ideas.
 Think
 SpaceX
 or
 Palunteer.


Imagine
 SpaceX
 without
 NASA.
 Exactly.


Canadian
 governments
 are
 less
 likely
 to


serve
 as
 anchor
 customers
 for
 early


stage
 innovation
 companies.
 On
 top
 of


that,
 Canada
 faces
 a
 smaller
 domestic


market
 and
 startups
 often
 relocate
 or


sell
 early
 to
 access
 the
 US
 buyers
 as


well
 as
 their
 venture
 capitals
 and


customer
 bases.
 Now,
 I'd
 like
 to
 add
 a


few
 things
 here
 as
 I
 personally
 don't


think
 that
 the
 size
 of
 the
 domestic


market
 is
 a
 very
 good
 excuse.
 Sure,


Canada
 has
 a
 small
 domestic
 market.
 So


does
 Switzerland.
 So
 does
 Sweden
 and
 so


does
 Israel.
 Switzerland
 dominates


Europe
 in
 semiconductor
 and
 chip


production.
 Sweden
 pumps
 out
 unicorns


that
 scale
 globally.
 And
 Israel
 produces


insane
 cyber
 security
 products
 that


dominate
 the
 US
 market.
 Canada
 can
 make


domestically
 and
 export
 technology.
 We


can
 make
 patents
 and
 sell
 to
 others.
 we


can
 find
 niches
 to
 take
 over
 and
 fully


dominate
 as
 a
 market
 leader.
 But


commercialization
 is
 not
 our
 forte.
 And


what
 this
 leads
 to
 is
 intellectual


property
 leakage
 because
 most
 successful


Canadian
 companies
 get
 quickly
 acquired


or
 headquartered
 elsewhere.
 Canadian


leaders
 are
 generally
 riskaverse.
 Many


Canadian
 firms
 are
 slow
 to
 see
 AI
 as


relevant
 to
 their
 operations
 which
 leads


to
 minimal
 experimentation
 and
 pilot


project.
 If
 you're
 surprised,
 trust
 me,


you're
 not
 alone.
 So
 was
 I.
 But
 when
 I


was
 doing
 the
 research
 for
 this
 video,
 I


found
 a
 bunch
 of
 resources
 published
 by


Canadian
 authors.
 And
 surprisingly,
 yes,


we
 are
 slow
 in
 AI
 adoption
 compared
 to


other
 tier
 one
 tech
 markets.
 I
 am


personally
 very
 lucky
 in
 that
 regard


because
 I
 work
 at
 a
 company
 that
 hugely


embraces
 AI
 adoption,
 which
 is
 amazing.


And
 I'm
 thankful
 for
 the
 fact
 that
 my


own
 workplace
 keeps
 everybody
 on
 their


toes.
 Maybe
 that's
 why
 I
 make
 videos


about
 debunking
 myths
 that
 AI
 is
 going


to
 replace
 us
 all.
 Because
 when
 you


truly
 understand
 how
 it
 works,
 it


becomes
 pretty
 evident
 that
 it
 won't


happen.
 But
 outside
 the
 bubble
 that
 I'm


in,
 the
 AI
 adoption
 in
 Canada
 is
 slow.


Now,
 I
 would
 like
 to
 pause
 here
 and


bring
 your
 attention
 to
 the
 intellectual


property
 or
 IP
 crisis
 because
 it's


really
 important.
 Why
 is
 intellectual


property
 so
 important
 in
 the
 context
 of


commercialization?
 It's
 important


because
 it
 determines
 who
 ultimately


controls,
 profits
 from,
 and
 builds
 on


major
 AI
 inventions.
 Let
 me
 hit
 you
 with


some
 sobering
 numbers.
 The
 intellectual


property
 and
 startup
 acquisition
 crisis


is
 more
 serious
 than
 ever.
 About
 75%
 of


patents
 produced
 by
 researchers
 at


Canada's
 top
 AI
 institutes
 now
 belong
 to


foreign
 multinational
 giants
 like
 Uber


and
 Nvidia.
 Only
 7%
 fully
 remain
 in


Canada.
 Let
 that
 sink
 in.
 Only
 7%.
 We're


not
 just
 losing
 intellectual
 property.


We're
 losing
 our
 economic
 future.
 Major


AI
 advances
 like
 new
 models,
 algorithms,


and
 methods
 can
 underpin
 entire
 new


industries
 or
 billion-dollar
 companies.


If
 intellectual
 property
 developed
 here


is
 commercialized
 elsewhere,
 the
 biggest


gains
 acrew
 to
 other
 countries,
 not
 us.


Let's
 talk
 about
 why
 we're
 losing


intellectual
 property.
 Lack
 of


commercialization
 infrastructure.


Federal
 incentives
 often
 support


research
 or
 early
 pilots,
 but
 not
 the


messy
 middle.

 ongoing


costs,

 and

 is


often
 dep
 prioritized
 past
 V1.
 Projects


frequently
 die
 after
 the
 pilot
 phase
 due


to
 this
 budget
 cliff.
 Insufficient


domestic
 funds,
 lack
 of
 hands-on


capital,
 and
 large
 investors
 willing
 to


commit
 the
 resources
 needed
 through
 the


full
 commercialization
 and
 the
 valley
 of


death.
 Access
 to
 scale

 Many


Canadian
 ventures
 reach
 a
 ceiling
 in


local
 VC
 and
 must
 look
 to
 US
 funds
 or


buyers
 for
 100
 million
 plus

 to

 Insufficient


AI

 Canada
 has
 lagged
 in
 scaling


up
 public
 and
 sovereign
 AI
 compute


infrastructure.
 A
 critical
 component
 for


modern
 AI
 R&D
 and
 commercialization.
 The


lack
 of
 domestic
 supercomputing
 forced


many
 startups
 and
 researchers
 to
 seek


resources
 abroad,
 often
 relocating


entirely.
 Are
 there
 specific
 examples
 of


Canadian
 AI
 research
 breakthroughs
 that


failed
 to
 commercialize
 in
 Canada
 but


succeeded
 elsewhere?
 Yes.

 It


highlighted
 challenges
 in
 scaling


complex

 domestically
 without


foreign
 support
 or

 a

pattern.
 Global

 breakthroughs
 to
 power

own

 rather
 than
 fostering
 Canadian


corporate
 champions
 or
 retaining
 the


full

 of

 domestically.


Notice
 a
 pattern.
 We're
 very
 good
 at


creating
 worldclass
 AI
 ventures.
 We're


just
 not
 very
 good
 at
 keeping
 them.
 Now,


let's
 talk
 about
 the
 talent
 drained
 by


the
 numbers.
 Recent
 Statistics
 Canada


data
 revealed
 that
 about
 86%
 of


mathematics
 and
 computer
 science


graduates
 were
 still
 in
 Canada
 3
 years


after
 graduating.
 This
 means
 that


roughly
 14%
 left
 within
 3
 years.
 The


retention
 drops
 further
 at
 the
 PhD


level.
 Only
 83%
 of
 Canadian
 doctoral


graduates
 remain
 in
 Canada
 3
 years


postgraduation,
 implying
 that
 about
 17%


of
 new
 PhDs
 across
 all
 STEM
 fields
 left


for
 opportunities
 abroad.
 This
 higher


doctorate
 outflow
 suggests
 that
 the
 more


highly
 trained
 the
 individual,
 the
 more


likely
 they
 are
 to
 seek
 employment


outside
 of
 Canada.
 Canada's
 presence


among
 the
 world's
 elite
 AI
 researchers


has
 declined
 significantly.
 In
 2019,


Canada
 was
 home
 to
 about
 10%
 of
 the


world's
 most
 elite
 AI
 researchers.
 By


2022,
 that
 share
 dropped
 to
 3%.
 The
 most


elite
 in
 this
 context
 refers
 to
 the
 top


AI
 research
 scientists,
 for
 example,


those
 selected
 for
 most
 prestigious


conference
 presentations.
 Similarly,


Canada's
 share
 of
 top
 tier
 AI


researchers,
 a
 slightly
 broader
 group


working
 in
 country
 fell
 from
 6%
 to
 2%
 in


2022.
 Many
 leading
 AI
 experts
 who
 have


Canadian
 ties
 by
 training
 or
 origin
 are


now
 working
 and
 building
 fantastic


companies
 elsewhere.
 The
 United
 States


is
 by
 far
 the
 top
 destination.
 About
 17%


of
 Canadian
 PhD
 graduates
 were
 working


in
 the
 US
 a
 few
 years
 after
 graduation


with
 8%
 in
 other
 countries.
 This


suggests
 that
 twothirds
 of
 all
 Canadian


PhD
 holders
 abroad
 are
 in
 the
 US.
 In


summary,
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 Brain
 Drain,


we're
 very
 focused
 customers.
 We
 don't


spread
 our
 talent
 around.
 We
 ship
 it


directly
 to
 the
 Silicon
 Valley,
 American


companies,
 and
 American
 universities.


Now,
 why
 do
 they
 leave?
 The
 primary


driver
 is
 money
 and
 resources.
 Canadian


AI
 Institute
 leaders
 note
 cases
 of


astronomical
 offers.
 Seven
 figure
 salary


offers
 straight
 out
 of
 graduation


offered
 by
 some
 American
 firms.
 Seven


figures
 straight
 out
 of
 graduation.
 Fang


companies
 can
 offer
 compensation


packages
 seldom
 matched
 in
 Canada.


Beyond
 salary,
 these
 companies
 provide


massive
 research
 budgets,
 state-of-art


computing
 infrastructure,
 and
 projects


with
 global
 impact,
 which
 is
 very


important
 for
 scientists,
 often
 times


more
 important
 than
 the
 salary
 itself.


In
 short,
 talent
 gravitates
 to
 where
 the


money
 and
 cutting
 edge
 opportunities


are,
 often
 Silicon
 Valley
 or
 other
 major


US
 AI
 labs.
 A
 number
 of
 students


mentored
 by
 Canada's
 godfathers
 of
 AI


like
 Jeffrey
 Hinton
 and
 Joshua
 Benjio


moved
 to
 the
 US
 after
 graduating.
 Now,


why
 is
 Canada
 able
 to
 build
 but
 not


sell?
 Policy
 makers
 have
 framed
 the
 risk


simply.
 Canada
 could
 end
 up
 mainly


importing
 AI
 solutions
 instead
 of


exporting
 them.
 When
 Canadian
 trained


talent
 builds
 careers
 at
 foreign
 firms,


the
 intellectual
 property,
 patents,
 and


AI
 platforms
 they
 create
 usually
 reside


outside
 of
 Canada.
 Canada's
 AI
 pioneers


have
 expressed
 that
 the
 country
 must


strive
 to
 be
 a
 producer,
 not
 just
 a


consumer
 of
 AI
 innovation.
 We
 have
 a


rare
 opportunity
 to
 make
 a
 very
 a
 very


expensive
 domestic
 product,
 a
 pipeline


of
 expensive
 products,
 and
 start
 pumping


them
 out
 the
 way
 China
 pumps
 out
 pretty


much
 anything
 from
 plastic
 to
 cars.
 A


continued
 brain
 drain
 undermines
 this


goal.
 For
 example,
 if
 a
 breakthrough
 in


AI
 healthcare
 is
 made
 by
 Canadian


researchers,
 but
 under
 a
 US
 company,


Canada
 may
 have
 to
 buy
 or
 license
 that


technology
 back.
 Over
 time,
 this
 dynamic


could
 put
 Canada
 at
 a
 competitive


disadvantage
 in
 terms
 of
 tax
 sovereignty


and
 economic
 returns
 from
 the
 AI
 sector.


And
 now,
 plot
 twist.


Trump's
 unexpected
 gift.
 Trump's


administration
 and
 new
 policies


beginning
 in
 2025
 have
 directly
 affected


Canada's
 AI
 brain
 drain
 in
 the
 opposite


direction
 from
 what
 many
 might
 expect.


Instead
 of
 worsening
 Canadian
 talent


outflows,
 recent
 US
 policies
 have


created
 an
 opportunity
 for
 Canada
 to


reverse
 some
 of
 its
 historic
 brain


drain,
 especially
 among
 highly
 skilled


AI
 researchers,
 academics,
 and
 STEM


professionals.
 Now,
 how
 have
 the
 US


administration
 policies
 changed?


significant
 cuts
 to
 federal
 funding
 for


US
 research,
 new
 restrictions
 on
 grant


criteria,
 more
 politicized
 intervention


in
 higher
 education,
 promises
 to
 shorten


visa
 durations,
 and
 limited
 pathways


like
 H-1B,
 OPT,
 and
 STEM
 OPT.
 And
 let's


be
 honest,
 the
 reason
 the
 Silicon
 Valley


has
 become
 the
 Silicon
 Valley
 that
 we


know
 it
 is
 because
 of
 H1B.
 And
 by
 the


way,
 to
 be
 clear,
 I'm
 neither
 condoning


nor
 condemning
 this.
 I
 simply
 treat
 this


as
 a
 data
 point
 in
 my
 research
 and


stating
 what
 happened.
 So,
 please
 don't


get
 into
 whose
 side
 are
 you
 on.
 The


official
 AI
 action
 plan
 released
 in
 July


2025
 by
 the
 Trump
 administration
 makes


no
 mention
 of
 immigration
 or
 the


attraction
 of
 foreignb
 born
 talent
 and


instead
 focuses
 on
 domestic
 regulation


and
 federal
 procurement.
 How
 does
 this


affect
 Canada?
 Canadian
 universities
 and


research
 institutes
 have
 reported


increased
 numbers
 of
 US
 professors,


researchers,
 and
 international
 students


seeking
 to
 relocate
 to
 Canada.
 Multiple


reports
 refer
 to
 this
 as
 a
 golden
 chance


for
 Canada
 to
 reverse
 its
 brain
 drain
 as


highly
 skilled
 people
 leave
 a
 newly


restrictive
 US
 for
 more
 stable
 and


researchfriendly
 environments.
 Now,


there
 is
 a
 very
 slim
 chance
 of
 this


video
 making
 it
 to
 Mr.
 Carney's


administration.
 But
 if
 you
 do
 happen
 to


see
 this
 video,
 Mr.
 Carney,
 please
 don't


f
 this
 up.
 This
 is
 our
 chance
 and
 it's


not
 going
 to
 last
 forever.
 Conclusion.


So,
 is
 Canada's
 AI
 brain
 drain
 real?
 The


answer
 is
 nuanced.
 The
 numbers
 don't


lie.
 We've
 gone
 from
 10%
 to
 3%
 of
 the


world's
 elite
 AI
 researchers
 in
 just


three
 years.
 Our
 best
 companies
 get


acquired,
 our
 best
 graduates
 get


poached,
 and
 our
 best
 innovators
 get


commercialized
 elsewhere.
 But,
 and
 this


is
 important,
 the
 tide
 might
 be
 turning.


Canada's
 fundamental
 strengths
 remain


intact.
 Worldclass
 research,
 significant


government
 investment,
 ethical
 AI


leadership,
 and
 now
 unexpectedly
 or


expectedly,
 a
 geopolitical
 advantage.


The
 brain
 drain
 was
 real.
 The
 question


now
 is
 whether
 we
 can
 capitalize
 on
 this


moment
 to
 reverse
 it.
 And
 that's
 it
 for


this
 episode
 of
 AI
 Hype
 versus
 Reality.


Would
 love
 to
 hear
 what
 you
 guys
 think.


Are
 we
 witnessing
 a
 reversal
 of
 Canada's


AI
 brain
 drain
 or
 just
 a
 temporary
 blip?


Let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 comments
 and
 I'll
 see


you
 in
 the
 next
 episode.
 As
 always,
 I


hope
 this
 was
 helpful.
 Till
 next
 time.


Bye.
