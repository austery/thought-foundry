This
 video
 series
 is
 for
 tech


professionals
 already
 living
 and
 working


in
 the
 US,
 Canada,
 the
 UK,
 or
 the


European
 Union.
 If
 you're
 based
 outside


these
 regions
 or
 in
 an
 outsourcing
 heavy


market,
 the
 data
 in
 this
 video
 will
 not


apply
 to
 your
 situation.
 I
 do
 not
 cover


immigration,
 international
 job
 hunting,


or
 topics
 like
 how
 to
 break
 into
 tech


without
 a
 college
 degree.
 If
 that's
 what


you're
 here
 for,
 this
 probably
 isn't
 the


right
 channel,
 and
 that's
 okay.
 But
 if


you
 are
 operating
 within
 these
 markets,


keep
 watching.
 There's
 a
 lot
 ahead
 for


various
 seniority
 levels
 and
 career


tracks
 in
 tech.
 Tech
 cities
 today
 can
 be


broken
 into
 three
 types.
 High
 salaries,


insane
 hustle
 culture,
 and
 you
 live


paycheck
 to
 paycheck.
 Mid
 salaries,


okayish
 balance,
 but
 taxes
 crush
 any


real
 ambition.
 Mid
 to
 low
 salaries,


affordable
 living,
 but
 social
 life
 is


non-existent.
 In
 a
 world
 where
 housing


costs
 have
 spiraled
 out
 of
 control,


inflation
 eats
 your
 race
 before
 it
 hits


your
 bank
 account,
 where
 geopolitical


tensions
 reshape
 borders,
 one
 question


looms
 large.
 Where
 to


run?
 I've
 spent
 the
 last
 year
 tracking


emerging
 tech
 ecosystems
 and


interviewing
 internationally
 just
 to


feel
 that
 difference
 firsthand.
 So
 the


question
 we
 should
 be
 asking
 ourselves


is
 not
 just
 is
 there
 a
 job
 for
 me,
 but


where
 can
 I
 afford
 to
 have
 a
 life
 worth


working


for?
 Today
 I'm
 launching
 a
 new
 series
 of


videos
 exploring
 tech
 hubs
 across
 the


world.
 Not
 only
 the
 usual
 places
 like


the
 Silicon
 Valley,
 although
 let's
 be


honest,
 we
 have
 to
 talk
 about
 it,
 but


also
 the
 rising
 hotspots
 where
 tech


workers
 might
 actually
 feel
 a
 better


quality
 of
 life,
 more
 freedom,
 and
 a


chance
 to
 build
 something
 without


burning
 out.
 In
 the
 next
 few
 videos,


we'll
 dive
 deep
 into
 the
 Americas
 and


Europe.
 We
 will
 break
 down
 what
 each


region
 gets
 right,
 and
 together,
 we
 will


map
 out
 the
 sweetest
 spot
 for
 tech


workers
 in
 2025
 and
 beyond.
 Hi,
 this
 is


Daria
 and
 this
 is
 Tech
 But
 Make
 It
 Real.


Don't
 forget
 to
 subscribe
 to
 stay


tuned.
 Today
 we're
 talking
 about
 the


mecca
 of
 tech,
 the
 United
 States
 of


America.
 Starting
 with
 San
 Francisco,


California,
 tech
 scene
 and
 culture.
 San


Francisco
 and
 the
 famous
 Bay
 Area
 remain


to
 be
 the
 global
 epicenter
 and
 the
 heart


of
 the
 cutting
 edge
 AI
 and
 startups.
 the


tech
 scene
 and
 the
 overall
 vibe
 in
 the


Bay
 Area
 don't
 compare
 it
 to
 anything


else.
 So,
 say
 what
 you
 will,
 that
 it's


oversaturated,
 that
 it's
 way
 too
 late
 to


go
 there,
 that
 it's
 unbelievably


overpriced,
 or
 that
 it's
 lost
 its
 soul


to
 money
 and
 business.
 And
 all
 of
 that


may
 be
 true,
 but
 there
 is
 a
 reason
 why


tech
 talent
 keeps
 flocking
 there.
 Many


have
 tried
 to
 replicate
 the
 Silicon


Valley,
 and
 all
 have
 fallen
 short.
 It


goes
 without
 saying
 that
 it's
 home
 to


massive
 tech
 giants,
 but
 what
 makes
 San


Francisco
 so
 magnetic
 isn't
 just
 the


companies.
 It's
 the
 people.
 Yes,
 the


hustle
 culture
 is
 real
 and
 it
 does
 burn


you
 out.
 But
 it's
 also
 where
 the
 most


ambitious,
 the
 most
 unreasonably
 driven


people
 come
 to
 build.
 Stanford


University
 plays
 a
 massive
 role
 in
 this


cultural
 phenomenon.
 It's
 a
 breeding


ground
 for
 that
 rare
 mix
 of
 courage,


intelligence,
 and
 relentless


perseverance.
 Quality
 of
 talent.
 The


concentration
 of
 highquality
 talent
 in


the
 Bay
 Area
 is
 hard
 to
 match.
 And
 no,


not
 every
 PM,
 not
 every
 engineer,
 not


every
 founder
 is
 trying
 to
 build
 the
 new


Slack.
 But
 the
 speed
 at
 which
 people
 are


able
 to
 operate.
 Their
 willingness
 to


learn,
 their
 willingness
 to
 improve,
 and


the
 level
 of
 ambition
 that
 an
 average


employee
 demonstrates
 at
 the
 company
 is


unlike
 any
 other
 tech
 hub
 on
 the
 planet.


If
 you're
 motivated
 by
 people
 around


you,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 spend
 time
 with


folks
 who
 are
 smarter
 that
 smarter
 than


you,
 that
 have
 access
 to
 resources
 that


you'd
 never
 reach
 without
 help,
 this


place
 will
 mold
 you
 to
 stay
 sharp,


curious,
 and
 very
 fast.
 The
 vibes.
 If


you're
 not
 from
 the
 Bay
 Area,
 you
 didn't


go
 to
 Stanford,
 you
 don't
 physically


live
 in
 the
 area,
 and
 have
 no
 network,


showing
 up
 to
 job
 hunt
 can
 feel
 like


walking
 into
 an
 old
 school
 British


private
 club.
 In
 my
 opinion,
 the
 best


way
 to
 move
 there
 is
 with
 an
 offer
 in


hand.
 Arrange
 for
 a
 job
 and
 then
 move.


Going
 without
 a
 plan
 and
 hoping
 to


figure
 it
 out
 is
 rarely
 a
 winning


strategy.
 What
 you'll
 often
 see
 on


LinkedIn
 is
 a
 pattern.
 People
 who


started
 their
 careers
 in
 the
 Bay
 Area,


they
 landed
 their
 first
 internship
 at


Fang
 or
 tier
 one
 company
 and
 for
 the


next
 decade
 they
 just
 rotate
 between
 the


top
 tier
 logos.
 It
 is
 not
 uncommon
 to


find
 a
 25year-old
 who
 has
 already
 done


stints
 at
 Pinterest,
 Google,
 Twitch,


Meta,
 or
 Discord.
 Are
 they
 really
 that


good?
 Sometimes,
 yes.
 But
 often
 it
 has


to
 do
 with
 your
 geographic
 location.


Simply
 being
 in
 the
 Bay
 Area,
 going
 to


school
 there,
 or
 even
 just
 living
 there


defines
 your
 proximity
 to
 opportunity.


It's
 the
 people
 you
 grab
 coffee
 with.


It's
 the
 people
 you
 go
 on
 a
 hike
 with.


It's
 the
 people
 you
 get
 beers
 with.
 So


when
 I
 say
 the
 cream
 of
 the
 crop,
 I
 mean


the
 right
 logos,
 the
 right
 resume,
 and


most
 importantly,
 the
 right
 network.
 And


if
 you
 don't
 have
 that,
 breaking
 in
 is


very,
 very
 tough.
 Cost
 of
 living
 and


salaries.
 It's
 a
 well-known
 fact,
 so
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 go
 too
 deep
 into
 that,
 but


the
 cost
 of
 living
 in
 the
 Bay
 Area
 in


San
 Francisco
 is
 beyond
 anything


rational.
 Rent
 will
 be
 your
 biggest


expense,
 and
 you
 will
 be
 shocked
 at
 the


conditions
 people
 are
 willing
 to
 pay.


absurd
 amount
 of
 money
 for
 San


Francisco.
 For
 all
 its
 beauty,
 the


ocean,
 the
 views,
 can
 also
 be
 very


sketchy.
 I
 was
 there
 just
 last
 fall
 with


a
 group
 of
 people
 from
 Europe,
 and
 for


many
 of
 them,
 it
 was
 a
 major
 cultural


shock.
 It
 usually
 doesn't
 stop
 people


from
 moving
 there,
 but
 if
 your


environment
 and
 aesthetics
 of
 the
 place


severely
 impact
 your
 mental
 health,
 be


very
 careful
 about
 the
 place
 where
 you


choose
 to
 live.
 Conclusion:
 At
 which


stage
 of
 your
 career
 is
 San
 Francisco
 a


good
 place
 to
 move
 to?
 Here's
 a
 little


summary
 of
 what
 I
 think.
 So,
 if
 you
 ever


get
 an
 offer
 and
 you
 sit
 down
 and
 do
 the


math
 and
 the
 conditions
 justify
 the


move,
 do
 it.
 Having
 that
 location
 and


having
 those
 logos
 on
 your
 resume
 will


elevate
 your
 market
 value
 for
 years
 to


come.
 Beyond
 that,
 you'll
 gain
 access
 to


a
 pool
 of
 extraordinary
 talent
 and


ambition.
 And
 let's
 be
 real,
 your
 career


is
 often
 only
 as
 good
 as
 your
 network.


There
 is
 a
 saying,
 you're
 not
 paying
 for


the
 location,
 you're
 paying
 for
 the


neighbors,
 and
 these
 neighbors
 are


definitely
 worth
 paying
 for.
 Lastly,
 I


have
 to
 mention
 the
 layoffs
 over
 the


past
 3
 years.
 Silicon
 Valley
 and
 the


rest
 of
 the
 US
 have
 been
 hit
 hard.
 As
 of


April
 2025,
 the
 Bay
 Area
 is
 still
 full


of
 people
 who
 were
 laid
 off
 after
 years


of
 fame.
 So,
 if
 you're
 job
 hunting


there,
 know
 that
 you
 will
 be
 competing


with
 the
 resumes
 that
 are
 the
 cream
 of


the
 crop.
 Once
 again,
 the
 safest
 move
 is


to
 land
 an
 offer
 and
 then
 pack
 your


bags.
 New
 York,
 New
 York.
 Tech
 scene
 and


culture.
 NYC
 is
 the
 largest
 tech
 hub
 on


the
 east
 coast
 of
 the
 United
 States
 with


a
 strong
 presence
 of
 tech
 giants
 and


startups.
 It
 offers
 excellent
 career
 and


education
 opportunities,
 making
 it
 a


great
 place
 for
 networking
 and


professional
 growth.
 So,
 let's
 talk


about
 what
 NYC
 isn't.
 It
 is
 not
 Silicon


Valley
 2.0.
 You
 won't
 find
 a
 founder
 on


every
 corner
 living
 with
 six
 roommates


and
 grinding
 to
 get
 into
 the
 next
 YC


batch.
 New
 York
 is
 more
 like
 here's
 a


billion-dollar
 industry.
 Let's
 slap
 some


AI
 on
 it,
 monetize
 the
 crap
 out
 of
 it,


and
 ship
 it
 by
 next
 week.
 NYC
 is


definitely
 becoming
 a
 bigger
 player
 in


startups
 and
 venture
 capital
 with
 a


growing
 early
 stage
 ecosystem
 and
 a


strong
 tech
 talent
 base,
 but
 it's
 still


dominated
 by
 the
 legacy
 giants
 IBM,


Thompson
 Reuters,
 Oracle,
 etc.
 It's
 less


technative
 and
 much
 more
 digital


transformation.
 When
 it
 comes
 to
 AI,


most
 of
 the
 innovation
 is
 happening


inside
 innovation
 labs
 at
 those
 legacy


firm
 internal
 AI
 roles
 at
 banks
 or
 tech


forward
 roles
 buried
 inside
 massive


enterprises.
 Sure,
 you
 can
 find
 some


technative
 midsize
 players,
 but
 most
 of


the
 market
 sits
 at
 the
 ends
 of
 the


spectrum
 with
 legacy
 being
 the
 dominant


force.
 It's
 less
 let's
 change
 the
 world


and
 a
 lot
 more
 let's
 make
 this


profitable
 and
 presentation
 ready
 by
 end


of
 day.
 Quality
 of
 talent.
 NYC
 talent


pool
 is
 far
 more
 diverse
 than
 what
 you


would
 typically
 find
 on
 the
 west
 coast.


You'll
 meet
 people
 from
 all
 kinds
 of


backgrounds,
 not
 just
 Stanford
 grads
 or


people
 who
 started
 their
 career
 in
 the


Bay
 Area.
 The
 city
 is
 much
 more
 open
 to


people
 who
 don't
 have
 fang
 logos
 on


their
 resume
 and
 that
 closed
 private


club
 sort
 of
 situation
 that
 I
 talked


about
 earlier.
 There
 is
 a
 lot
 less
 of


that
 here.
 You'll
 find
 people
 from


across
 the
 US,
 Canada,
 Asia,
 or
 Europe,


all
 coming
 with
 vastly
 different


backgrounds.
 Now,
 some
 tech
 bros
 will


say
 that
 the
 quality
 of
 talent
 in
 New


York
 does
 not
 stack
 up
 to
 the
 West


Coast.
 I
 respectfully
 disagree.
 These


are
 two
 entirely
 different
 ecosystems


and
 naturally
 the
 skill
 sets
 vary.
 In


fact,
 New
 York
 is
 one
 of
 the
 places


where
 having
 an
 MBA
 might
 actually
 be
 a


good
 career
 investment
 because
 here
 you


often
 find
 massive
 orcs
 and
 massive


budgets.
 The
 vibes
 New
 York
 has
 always


been
 and
 will
 always
 be
 a
 dynamic,


chaotic,
 deeply
 cultural
 place.
 It's
 a


masterclass
 in
 branding,


unapologetically
 American,
 very
 raw
 and


industrial,
 jarringly
 full
 of


contradictions.
 It's
 gritty.
 It's


overwhelming.
 It's
 inspiring
 and
 yes,


often
 terribly
 smelling.
 But
 as
 a
 city,


I
 love
 it.
 There
 is
 nothing
 else
 quite


like
 it.
 With
 that
 said,
 if
 you're


moving
 there,
 you
 need
 to
 be
 at
 peace


with
 being
 a
 single
 drop
 in
 a
 very
 large


ocean.
 Unless
 you're
 coming
 in
 at
 a
 very


senior
 level.
 It's
 cutthroat
 and
 the


intensity
 stems
 from
 one
 simple
 truth.


There
 is
 always
 a
 line
 of
 people
 ready


to
 take
 your
 spot.
 Cost
 of
 living
 and


salaries.
 as
 a
 data
 scientist,
 a


software
 engineer,
 or
 a
 product
 manager,


you're
 looking
 at
 making
 between
 160
 to


180,
 probably
 200
 if
 you're
 in
 big
 tech.


So,
 good
 salaries,
 but
 far
 from
 the
 Bay


Area.
 On
 top
 of
 that,
 New
 York
 hits
 you


with
 a
 combo
 move.
 Federal
 tax,
 state


tax,
 and
 city
 tax.
 And
 then
 rent
 shows


up
 like,
 "Hey,
 I'm
 $35,000
 a
 month,
 and


by
 the
 way,
 you're
 not
 getting
 an
 AC,
 a


dishwasher,
 and
 you
 probably
 start


looking
 for
 the
 nearest
 laundromat."


You're
 basically
 paying
 to
 live
 in
 the


city.
 You're
 not
 broke,
 but
 you're
 also


not
 balling.
 Conclusion:
 When
 is
 New


York
 a
 good
 idea?
 If
 your
 goal
 is
 to


make
 serious
 money
 while
 staying


employed,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 very


financially
 difficult
 until
 you
 hit
 the


upper
 levels.
 So,
 if
 your
 plan
 is
 to


climb
 all
 the
 way
 to
 the
 top
 of
 the


corporate
 ladder,
 yes,
 it's
 worth
 it.


But
 you
 need
 to
 grow
 an
 extremely
 thick


skin.
 If
 you
 have
 been
 offered
 a
 very


senior
 role
 and
 the
 compensation
 makes


sense,
 do
 it.
 Nobrainer.
 If
 you
 want


connections,
 you
 crave
 the
 speed,
 and


you
 want
 to
 be
 around
 that
 unfiltered


American
 energy,
 and
 you
 want
 to
 be


surrounded
 by
 people
 who
 live
 and


breathe
 work,
 100%
 you
 will
 get
 that


here.
 When
 is
 it
 not
 worth
 it?
 If
 you're


looking
 to
 work
 on
 cutting
 edge
 AI,


quantum,
 autonomous
 driving,
 deep
 tech,


you're
 probably
 better
 off
 looking
 at


the
 West
 Coast
 or
 some
 parts
 of
 Texas.


NYC
 simply
 doesn't
 have
 the
 same
 density


of
 AI
 roles
 in
 those
 domains.
 If
 you're


not
 ultra
 senior
 and
 you're
 hoping
 to


have
 a
 comfortable
 job
 and
 save
 more


than
 30%
 of
 your
 income,
 hell
 no,
 not


happening.
 We
 didn't
 want
 to
 make
 this


video
 too
 long,
 so
 we
 decided
 to
 split


it
 in
 two
 parts.
 This
 is
 the
 end
 of
 part


one.
 In
 part
 two,
 we
 will
 talk
 about
 the


tech
 hubs
 that
 are
 less
 popular
 than
 NYC


and
 San
 Francisco,
 but
 where
 life
 is


much
 more
 affordable
 and
 the
 values
 are


simply
 different.
 So
 stay
 tuned
 and


we'll
 see
 you
 shortly.
 Bye.
