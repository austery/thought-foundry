hi
 everybody
 tune
 in
 to
 this
 short


version
 of
 the
 podcast
 which
 we
 do
 every


Friday
 for
 the
 long
 version
 tune
 in
 on


Wednesdays
 hi
 everyone
 today
 we
 have
 the


great
 pleasure
 of
 having
 Peter
 Harrison


on
 the
 show
 Peter
 is
 the
 CEO
 of
 schroers


one
 of
 the
 biggest
 asset
 managers
 in


Europe
 and
 amazingly
 shos
 has
 been
 in


business
 for
 nearly
 or
 for
 roughly
 200


years
 Peter
 great
 to
 have
 you
 here
 thank


you
 great
 pleasure
 only
 45
 out
 of
 1


million


companies
 exist
 for
 100
 years
 and
 you've


been
 doing
 it
 for
 200
 years
 well
 the


what's
 the
 trick
 so
 I
 think
 the
 the
 key


is
 committed
 ownership
 we've
 got
 a


family
 backing
 who
 takes
 a
 20e
 view
 of


where
 we
 need
 to
 go
 and
 and
 because
 of


that
 the
 business
 has
 changed
 and


evolved
 and
 the
 we've
 been
 in
 lots
 of


different
 businesses
 in
 the
 finance


sector
 throughout
 that
 time
 but
 we've


continued
 to
 change
 and
 I
 think
 that's


only
 possible
 if
 you've
 got
 a
 committed


long-term
 ownership
 structure
 which


allows
 that
 change
 if
 we
 do
 the
 last
 10


years
 what
 are
 the
 biggest
 changes


you've
 seen
 in
 Investment
 Management


huge
 yeah
 so
 massive
 growth
 of
 passive


management
 huge
 growth
 towards
 privates


um
 a
 collapse
 in
 fees
 so
 just
 to
 for
 the


for
 the
 listeners
 uh
 private
 is
 like


private
 Equity
 passive
 is
 index
 funds


absolutely
 and
 and
 and
 private
 debt
 the


world
 the
 world
 is
 moving
 away
 from


public
 companies
 towards
 private


companies
 um
 a
 a
 revolution
 in


governance
 huge
 agenda
 on
 climate
 um


collapse
 in
 fees
 so
 wholesale
 CH
 the


industry
 is
 going
 through
 a
 major


disruption


why
 are
 the
 Americans
 doing
 better
 are


the
 Americans
 working
 harder
 are
 they


clever
 what
 is
 it
 no
 no
 they're
 not


they're
 not
 working
 harder
 they're
 not


clever
 but
 they
 do
 have
 some
 innate


advantages
 of
 of
 scale
 to
 start
 with


they
 had
 more
 partnership
 type


structures
 which
 I
 think
 is
 is
 is
 a
 very


good
 structure
 in
 an
 asset
 management


business
 um
 because
 you're
 sharing
 100%


of
 the
 pie
 with
 with
 people
 in
 the


business
 rather
 than
 a
 portion
 of
 the


pie
 and
 I
 think
 we've
 also
 seen
 this


very
 big
 change
 of
 the
 growth
 of


privates
 and
 and
 in
 private
 markets
 the


big
 bigger
 you
 are
 the
 bigger
 the
 mod


how
 does
 the
 kind
 of
 the
 decline
 of
 the


UK
 Capital
 Market
 play
 in
 here
 so
 if
 you


go
 back
 go
 back
 15
 years
 the
 UK
 has
 one


of
 the
 largest
 pools
 of
 domestic
 Savings


in
 the
 world
 yeah
 and
 we
 regulated
 that


out
 of
 existence
 so
 it
 basically
 bought


government
 bonds
 and
 and
 stopped
 taking


risk
 and
 we
 put
 consumer
 protection
 at


the
 center
 and
 that
 Shrunk
 the
 UK
 as
 as


an
 equity
 Market
 considerably
 saw
 huge


outflows
 over
 the
 last
 15
 years
 and
 then


we
 put
 in
 a
 corporate
 governance
 codee


which
 said
 conflict
 between
 shareholders


and
 companies
 is
 a
 good
 thing
 and


everything
 every
 League
 table
 was
 the


more
 times
 you
 vote
 against
 management


the
 better
 and
 those
 two
 things
 were


were
 unhelpful
 for
 listings
 they
 were


unhelpful
 for
 thriving
 domestic
 Capital


those
 are
 now
 changing
 and
 people
 are


are
 going
 back
 towards
 more
 risk-taking


they're
 going
 back
 to
 more
 constructive


environment
 so
 the
 the
 listed
 Market
 has


has
 struggled
 I
 think
 what's
 happened
 at


the
 same
 time
 is
 London
 has
 boomed
 with


private
 Market
 markets
 with
 hedge
 funds


um
 as
 a
 center
 for
 you
 know
 people


coming
 together
 we've
 got
 some
 fantastic


Life
 Sciences
 the
 problem
 is
 it's
 being


it's
 foreign
 Capital
 which
 is
 driving


those
 businesses
 not
 domestic
 Capital
 so


the
 returns
 are
 not
 going
 to
 UK
 Savers


and
 I
 think
 as
 a
 country
 that's
 a
 big


problem
 what
 hases
 brexit
 did
 to
 this


well
 brexit
 was
 just
 it
 undermined
 two


things
 it
 undermined
 confidence
 in
 the


UK
 as
 a
 place
 to
 make
 long-term


decisions
 and
 it
 created
 two
 or
 three


years
 of
 complete
 Hiatus
 and
 then
 you


after
 brexit
 you
 had
 Boris
 government


Boris
 Johnson's
 government
 you
 had
 a


whole
 set
 of
 challenges
 around
 list


trust's
 budget
 and
 the
 guilts
 crisis
 all


of
 a
 sudden
 the
 UK
 as
 a
 serious


counterpart
 and
 a
 place
 to
 invest


started
 to
 decline
 we've
 started
 to
 see


that
 correct
 but
 but
 say
 scars
 take
 a


while
 to
 heal
 is
 there
 um
 a
 danger
 that


in
 order
 to
 attract
 companies
 you
 loosen


up
 on
 the
 rules
 and
 regulations
 to
 the


extent
 that
 it
 becomes
 you
 know
 uh
 Wild


West
 well
 that's
 that's
 the
 argument


that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 will
 make
 the
 the


other
 question
 is
 if
 you
 take
 no
 risk


you
 don't
 get
 a
 return
 and
 so
 I
 I
 think


the
 the
 answer
 is
 you
 you
 have
 a
 set
 of


rules
 and
 if
 companies
 abide
 by
 those


rules
 they
 can
 list
 in
 the
 UK
 and
 then


it's
 for
 active
 managers
 to
 choose
 which


they
 want
 to
 own
 and
 which
 they
 don't


want
 to
 own
 and
 and
 I
 think
 the
 UK
 has


always
 been
 good
 at
 active
 risk-taking


and
 I
 think
 you
 slightly
 careful
 that


you
 don't
 set
 a
 set
 of
 rules
 which
 are


so
 prohibitive
 that
 no
 one
 wants
 to
 be


here
 and
 that's
 where
 we
 were
 5
 years


ago
 that
 that's
 changed
 do
 we
 need
 a


unified


European
 Equity
 Capital
 Market
 yeah
 and


will
 will
 we
 get
 it
 no
 AI
 how
 is
 that


going
 to
 change
 the
 way
 you
 do
 things


everything
 in
 what
 way
 everything
 well
 I


think
 it
 fundamentally
 changes
 the


landscape
 of
 the
 companies
 we
 invest
 in


in
 the
 very
 short
 term
 we
 will
 spend
 a


lot
 of
 time
 trying
 to
 do
 things
 better


in
 the
 probably
 far
 more
 quickly
 than
 we


realize
 we
 will


find
 we
 do
 things
 very
 very
 very


differently
 and
 the
 moment
 we're
 all


thinking
 about
 the
 better
 bit
 but


actually
 the
 real
 change
 will
 come
 from


when
 we
 do
 it
 differently
 so
 I
 think
 the


first
 place
 we'll
 see
 a
 major
 Chang
 is


in
 wealth
 because
 my
 sense
 is
 that


people
 will
 turn
 to
 their
 beautiful
 AI


assistant
 who
 will
 become
 who
 will
 know


them
 better
 than
 anybody
 and
 ask
 them


for
 wealth
 advice
 in
 a
 way
 that
 they


currently
 ask
 people
 and
 I
 I
 don't


believe
 our
 portfolio
 managers
 are
 in


different
 from
 any
 other
 industry
 if
 we


can
 if
 if
 AI
 is
 helping
 understand
 the


human
 genome
 back
 backwards
 the


microbiome
 backwards
 it
 can
 certainly


help
 you
 make
 become
 a
 better
 investor


and
 I
 think
 it's
 beholden
 on
 us
 to
 make


sure
 those
 tools
 and
 that
 data
 is
 in


front
 of
 our
 portfolio
 managers
 when


they
 make
 decisions
 now
 you
 are
 on
 how


to
 build
 good
 teams
 how
 to
 build
 good


teams
 yeah
 so
 how
 do
 you
 build
 good


teams
 first
 thing
 you
 you
 need
 brilliant


leaders
 of
 those
 teams
 you
 need
 to
 give


them
 great
 tools
 they
 need
 to
 be
 the


right
 size
 they
 need
 to
 be
 near
 their


local
 markets
 um
 and
 you
 need
 to
 give


them
 space
 to
 get
 things
 wrong
 because


great
 investors
 don't
 get
 it
 right
 every


single
 day
 then
 they
 might
 be
 wrong
 for


three
 or
 four
 years
 at
 a
 time
 and
 you've


got
 to
 be
 willing
 to
 put
 your
 arms


around
 them
 and
 support
 them
 but
 the


critical
 thing
 is
 you
 understand
 the


risk
 to
 take
 and
 they're
 good
 Risk


Takers
 and
 you
 and
 you
 got
 your
 head


around
 who
 is
 managing
 their
 way
 through


that
 and
 the
 path
 dependency
 of
 returns


and
 what
 kind
 of
 leader
 are
 you
 well
 I


I've
 discovered
 that
 I'm
 I'm
 a


connecting
 with
 the
 organization
 and


trying
 to
 drive
 the
 hearts
 of
 the


organization
 as
 much
 as
 the
 minds
 of
 the


organization
 has
 been
 ended
 up
 being


being
 the
 style
 that
 that
 I've
 done
 I


I'm
 passionate
 about
 Innovation
 I'm
 I


spent
 my
 time
 paid
 my
 way
 through


University
 Writing
 code
 so
 I'm
 a
 bit
 of


a
 geek
 so
 for
 me
 the
 the
 getting
 the


Innovation
 being
 really
 consistent
 about


your
 strategic
 Vision
 just
 being


resilient
 and
 not
 be
 banged
 off
 course


um
 but
 making
 sure
 you
 take
 the


organization
 with
 you
 because
 the


problem
 in
 most
 businesses
 is
 the
 huge


layers
 of
 permafrost
 that
 don't
 think


change
 has
 got
 anything
 to
 do
 with
 them


and
 how
 do
 you
 bring
 those
 people


through
 and
 and
 create
 those
 new


capabilities
 how
 do
 you
 melt
 permafrost


I
 think
 culture
 change
 the
 so
 so
 great


great
 teams
 right
 is
 a
 difference


between
 a
 between
 a
 good
 company
 and
 a


great
 company
 and
 and
 and
 great
 leaders


within
 those
 teams
 will
 will
 drive
 that


change
 but
 you
 need
 to
 shine
 daylight


into
 dark
 Corners
 it's
 the
 best


disinfectant
 have
 you
 been
 bold
 enough


so
 I
 if
 I
 look
 back
 what's
 the
 thing
 I


wish
 I'd
 done
 more
 of
 is
 be
 more
 bold


and
 in
 what
 ways
 should
 you
 have
 been


more
 bold
 so
 we
 should
 have
 done
 more


private
 markets
 earlier
 because


compounding
 up
 we
 should
 have
 probably


been
 more
 willing
 to
 acquire
 more
 teams


and
 not
 do
 as
 much


organically
 um
 and
 I
 think
 I
 look
 back


the
 things
 you
 have
 acquired
 quite
 a
 lot


we
 have
 acquired
 quite
 a
 lot
 but
 we


acquired
 small
 because
 I
 didn't
 want
 to


destroy
 the
 culture
 yeah
 and
 so
 for
 me


because
 the
 challenge
 I
 think
 is
 that


public
 market
 culture
 and
 private
 Market


culture
 are
 really
 different
 and
 can
 you


get
 them
 to
 coexist
 in
 the
 same


organization
 successfully
 is
 is
 hard
 and


that
 was
 the
 thing
 which
 you've
 seen


ruin
 many
 companies
 and
 I
 so
 said
 we're


going
 to
 we're
 going
 to
 work
 really
 hard


at
 this
 but
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 slowly


with
 hindsight
 the
 disruption
 in
 our


industry
 has
 been
 way
 quicker
 yeah
 than


anyone
 thought
 what
 do
 you
 make
 of
 the


recent
 swing
 in
 appetite
 for
 ESG
 well


first
 thing
 to
 say
 it's
 been
 politicized


so
 that's
 so
 you've
 seen
 this
 huge


Geographic
 diversion
 yeah
 um
 and
 you've


you
 you
 absolutely
 have
 passed
 Peak


debate
 I
 mean
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't


want
 to
 talk
 about
 it
 now
 and
 you've


seen
 it
 but
 I
 think
 in
 boardrooms
 and


people's
 awareness
 of
 the
 importance
 of


climate
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 debated
 at


all
 so
 what
 companies
 are
 getting
 on
 and


doing
 is
 very
 real
 it's
 just
 people


spend
 a
 lot
 less
 time
 talking
 about
 it


in
 a
 world
 with
 increased
 geopolitical


frictions
 between
 the
 US
 and
 China
 for


instance
 um
 what
 are
 the
 dilemas
 of


being
 a
 large
 player
 in
 China
 for
 you


well
 it's
 really
 interesting
 isn't
 it


most
 us
 players
 have
 stopped
 talking


about
 their
 Chinese
 investments
 in
 their


in
 their
 public
 statements
 but
 they


haven't
 pulled
 back
 from
 their


activities
 on
 the
 ground
 because
 this
 is


one
 of
 the
 largest
 savings
 markets
 in


the
 world
 it's
 a
 huge
 you
 know
 it's
 it's


second
 only
 to
 the
 US
 have
 you
 stopped


talking
 about
 it
 or
 no
 we've
 we
 we've


said
 very
 open
 about
 it
 what
 do
 you
 read


a
 lot
 what
 one
 of
 one
 of
 the
 greatest


privileges
 is
 is
 I'm
 a
 judge
 of
 the
 Ft


book
 of
 the
 year
 so
 I
 read
 a
 lot
 of


books
 about
 about
 business
 so
 I'm
 my


anything
 which
 is
 about
 society
 today


for
 me
 so
 so
 a
 brilliant
 book
 just
 out


the
 longevity
 imperative
 that
 says
 we've


get
 we're
 getting
 ourselves


thinking
 about
 longevity
 completely
 the


wrong
 way
 um
 Jonathan
 Height's
 book


about
 the
 impact
 of
 mobile
 technology
 on


children
 you
 know
 the
 the
 stuff
 ravenous


about
 about
 Food
 Systems
 being
 broken


around
 the
 world
 those
 are
 the
 really


big
 issues
 I
 think
 we
 Face
 come
 on
 give


us
 some
 more
 titles
 you
 read
 all
 these
 W


Supremacy
 on
 on
 AI
 you
 Amy
 ederson
 was


was
 our
 winner
 last
 year
 which
 you
 you


you
 obviously
 covered
 in
 your
 podcast


which
 was
 was
 a
 brilliant
 book
 on
 on


learning
 from
 failure
 and
 I
 think


there's
 so
 much
 great
 I
 mean
 there's
 so


many
 brilliant
 books
 being
 written
 I


just
 don't
 have
 enough
 time
 to
 read


them
 I
 agre
