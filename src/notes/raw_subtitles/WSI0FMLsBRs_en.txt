[jazz music]
[Peter] Sarah, you're from
Staten Island, born and raised?
-Born and raised.
-And you were saying over the phone
most people
don't understand Staten Island.
Most New Yorkers, you were saying
don't even come here.
Me, myself, I've been to New York,
I don't know, 50 times.
And I've never been to Staten Island.
That's typical.
It's either "I've only ever
driven through Staten Island."
or you'd hear like,
"I've never been there before."
Isn't that like where there's a dump?
-Okay. Which there is right?
Not anymore.
As the years go on people are not
mentioning the dump anymore.
But that was a huge part
of island life and culture growing up.
So this is postcards.
This is the September 11th memorial.
Staten Island took
a quite a devastating hit
in terms of residents that passed.
A lot of which were firefighters.
It's still really hard actually
to look out and not see the towers there.
-Even though you're
physically detached from Manhattan
it's right there but a world away.
You're so connected to it
because so many people here work there.
-Oh my goodness.
-Firefighters.
-Thousands of people every single day
still take that ride and go to work.
Kenneth Fitzgerald was
up on the 110th floor.
So everybody up there passed.
Everybody above the impact zone
passed away.
[Peter] Firefighter, vice president,
administrative assistant,
senior vice president, firefighter,
bond broker, firefighter, supervisors.
[Peter sighs in disbelief]
-Our family had a major significant loss.
Our cousin is Steven Siller.
He was off duty.
He was listening to the scanner.
He was on his way to play golf
with his brothers.
and he heard the call come in
and he turned around.
They wouldn't let him through the tunnel
because they had closed it.
And he strapped his gear on his back
and ran through the Battery Tunnel
to the towers.
-Where he ultimately passed away. Yeah.
-Wow.
[Sarah] We're on Richmond Terrace
and you're going to see
a very sharp change.
-A lot of different sides right?
-Lots of different sides.
-And we're going to go through them?
-Yes.
So you can speak credibly
about Staten Island
because you lived on the South Side
and the North Side.
-Born on the South Shore and I lived there
for the first 25 years of my life.
The other equal half of my life
I've lived on the North Shore.
Staten Islanders who don't really know
Staten Island on this end
they will consider Jersey Street
the worst street on Staten Island.
It's not really true.
That's just lower income…
Come on. Let's go.
Show me the Staten Island honk.
There's a Staten Island honk isn't there?
[honks]
Come on guy. What the f*ck are we doing?
Sorry that's very Staten Island. [laughs]
You gonna bleep that?
-So it's like old school New York here.
-If you want to show me
getting road rage it's fine.
This is where they filmed Working Girl.
So it's a famous movie from the 1980s.
This is the house that Alec Baldwin
runs out of naked.
-When Melanie Griffith catches him
sleeping with someone else.
That right there.
-It's not what it was obviously.
Absolutely.
-[man] …doing that video, yeah!
-[Sarah laughs]
-I knew you were gonna get that.
-What did he say?
I don't even know what he said
but I knew when they saw the camera
they were going to get excited
and want to participate.
Okay. That's a good vibe.
So this is 71 Jersey Street.
These are the Richmond Terrace houses
which, you know, cool.
Lots of people hanging out
having a good time at night.
Police shine a gigantic spotlight.
It's probably a high crime corner
that they do that on.
And I guess I understand
why they're doing that.
But if I lived there
that would drive me crazy.
-They shine a bright light on that corner?
Very bright like a football field.
And then this is a
little bit of a different feel
but this is more public housing area here.
-What's crime like in Staten Island?
It's usually drug related.
South Shore of Staten Island has a huge
opioid crisis drug problem type stuff.
-So silly question
that I know the answer to.
But I think some people might think
we're outside of New York City
but this is just as New York City
technically as Manhattan.
Your vote goes the same way.
Like every year you have city police,
New York City police.
Absolutely.
There's nothing autonomous
about here right?
Nothing at all.
We pay New York City taxes.
Our kids go to New York City
public school.
Okay it's got an interesting feel
I can't put a finger on.
It feels like a little bit of
the Rust Belt like Pennsylvania.
It feels a bit like Jersey so far.
-Yeah
-That will continue. Yeah.
-But we're just a few minutes in.
This area is interesting.
This area has the largest population
of Sri Lankans
outside of Sri Lanka.
-Seriously?
-Yeah
[Sarah] This is the Albanian mosque.
[Peter] It's mixed up here.
-Yes but you'll see like
new Sri Lankan restaurant.
-Sri Lankan restaurant.
Masala Harbor.
[Sarah] And to me honestly
if I had the big bucks on Staten Island
I'd be living where I'm about to show you
and not where
the average money is on Staten Island.
As you get into the hills
on the North Shore here
look at how quickly…
-Yeah that's literally one minute away.
-Yep.
So that's how the North Shore is.
The North Shore is
pockets of little gorgeous areas.
My husband built this house.
-Oh this one? Nice.
-Yep.
That's a cool house.
-Oh it's for sale. I gotta tell him.
There was a tree through the house--
-How much do you think that house is?
Oh I'm sure it's gonna go
for over a million.
-Okay.
-Yeah easily.
Now as we get around this bend
you're going to get views of Manhattan.
The houses will be
exponentially more expensive.
-You can see…
-Oh right, through the trees.
If you're above that you're seeing
all the way into Manhattan.
-These views are
the closest Manhattan view.
-So there are hills--
-Oh that is sweet.
I can see that at night all lit up.
-Yeah it's beautiful.
-Prime real estate here.
-Oh yeah.
-That is wild.
-How gorgeous.
So is there a lot of old money up here?
Or is it new Manhattan money
that wants more of a rural life?
-I think you've got a little bit of both.
-There's old money.
-That is definitely old money.
-[laughter]
So when you're in Manhattan you work there
all the time. You're a nurse.
When you say Staten Island
what do people think usually?
-It's looked down on for the most part.
And that always cracks me up.
Even by people
who are not from New York City
Okay.
But they just heard that
that's something to look down on.
It makes them more of a New Yorker
if they look down on Staten Island.
-So right around the corner.
-There we go.
-That is--
-Wild right?
I have never seen a contrast like that.
So the history of Staten Island
it was mostly Italians
who came here first?
Or who came here?
-The Italians came
when the Verraazano Bridge was built.
There's a couple of funny… names.
Okay. For the Italians?
[laughing] For the Verrazzano Bridge.
-Like uh…
-Like Wapazano Bridge or something?
I don't want it to be on uh…
I don't want it to be on cam…
I'm not sensitive to it.
No I know you.
I don't want it on camera
but I'm a pizza bagel.
-Pizza bagel is half Italian, half Jewish?
Yep.
That's the classic Staten Island combo
by the way.
Is it? Italian Jews?
Italians and the Jews get along well.
At least from a secular standpoint
here on Staten Island.
We both love to eat.
We're both loud.
You both drive aggressively?
I'm trying to drive.
-No drive--
-On my best behavior.
No, no, no. Doing the Staten Island.
We want this to be a real video.
[Sarah chuckles]
Hey.
She don't want you. Move along okay?
-He was hitting on her?
That guy was hitting on her.
All she's trying to do is
deliver her Amazon packages
and this guy is trying to roll up on her.
-I never even thought of that.
Like imagine.
Doing Amazon delivery and getting hit on
when you're like in this heat too.
[scoffs] Oh God.
-On the island you're calling sh*t out
when you see it like that.
-Oh yeah.
-How do you like living on an island?
I mean does it truly feel
like an island here?
Yeah it feels just like Barbados.
-Hawaii?
-It feels just like Hawaii, yeah.
It's got a Maui vibe?
-Yeah it does.
-It does have a Maui vibe. Totally.
A lot of native Staten Islanders
there's a little bit of a sense
of feeling trapped even though
we're not technically trapped
but at least in my case
and in my husband's case
because he was also born on Staten Island
which in my generation
is also a pretty rare thing to find
because most of the kids I grew up with
and that are my age
were born in Brooklyn.
And our roots are so intertwined here
that it's hard to leave
but it just gets more crowded and just…
You get sick of it. It's small.
These were actually homes for sailors.
Like sailors came and retired here.
Sailor's Snug Harbor
is another name for it.
And then the Chinese Scholar Garden
is this way as well.
-Chinese Scholar Garden?
-Yes.
Tourists from China
actually come here to see that
because it's one of the few authentic
Chinese scholar gardens in the world.
-Oh this is beautiful.
-These buildings are also really cool.
We can park over here and walk.
-Yeah let's get out.
-Okay, yeah, I agree.
The sailors,
the maritime people of Staten Island
this was their complex.
They retired here.
This is a beautiful old church.
-Basically their own village?
-Yeah.
-I read there are more parks here
than any other part of New York City.
Staten Island has the most green space.
So you get a lot of this huh?
Yeah this is actually a farm.
They have a farmer's market
and they actually provide
produce to local restaurants.
Oh cool.
-We have a couple farm-to-table programs.
-Nice
This is where every Staten Islander
has wedding photos.
-Okay this is the place?
The Tunnel of Love?
-The Tunnel exactly.
Eggers, it's an institution
on Staten Island
and this is like
a little satellite location.
But Eggers Ice Cream is the best ice cream
on Staten Island that's for sure.
-Are you going to do some?
-I mean I certainly would.
Okay let's do it.
Give this a try.
We actually got the same flavor.
-And this is the smallest size?
-Yep.
I asked for the smallest cone
and the smallest scoop
and this is what I got.
We're going to try some
pizza later too right?
-Sure are.
You said there's like a pizza showdown
going on here on the island?
Joe and Pat's versus Denino's.
-Joe and Pat's versus Denino's?
-Yep.
-Dessert first.
-Yep.
That is good.
That's good ice cream.
-Rich, creamy.
Rich and yeah it's got substance to it.
Mmm.
Okay so the pizza
we're going to go to later
you're saying
it's a huge rival on the island.
-Or are you playing it up a little?
-No no.
We can stop anybody and ask them
as long as they are a Staten Islander.
You can stop anyone and ask them.
So tell me the difference.
-Well--
-Who's going thicker crust?
See I'm a Joe & Pat's girl.
I probably should just have
like not even say any…
I shouldn't even build it up.
I should just let you decide.
-Okay let's leave it at that.
-Okay. All right.
All right guys, let's take a little break
to talk about today's sponsor.
As we all know navigating the news
is very challenging these days.
Every journal has an angle
either leaning one way or the other.
And this is what makes figuring out
what's going on extremely difficult.
So what's helped me
is the app and website Ground News.
With Ground News you can see who's
covering a specific story and who isn't.
Ground News will get you out
of your information silo
with tools like its Blind Spot feature.
For example the story,
"Mamdani defends $60 million
city-run grocery pilot on CNN."
That story is covered mostly by the Right.
Or the story, "Murdoch's succession deal
gives Loughlin control through 2050
buys out three siblings."
That story is covered mostly by the Left.
So often it's not what's being covered
it's what's not being covered.
And Ground News helps you see this.
Use Ground News
to get all sides of every story
be better informed with access to a vast
amount of worldwide sources in one place
and see who owns what media
and follow the trail of
where the money is coming from.
I'm a big fan of Ground News.
They've been a longtime sponsor of this
channel and I think you'll like them too.
Go to groundnews.com/peter
to check them out.
Subscribe through my link below
in the description
so they know that I sent you

That's right, 40% off

Now back to the story.
[police siren blares]
That's number three
that we had to pull over
for a cop rushing around.
We would normally be like
"Oh rushing to Dunkin' Donuts?"
We're heading to the true
decrepit waterfront now.
-We're going decrepit? Okay.
-Decrepit waterfront.
-I like that you're not giving the full
North Korea tour of Staten Island.
Do you know what that is?
No we're good. We're good.
-The North Korea tour is--
-No what is that?
When tourists go to North Korea
they show them only the nicest things.
-Oh right.
-Make it look utopic.
Like the government minder.
I'm your Staten Island minder.
Yeah but I like that you're not
giving me the North Korea tour.
No this is the sewage treatment plant.
My kids always call this
the Oreo cookie factory.
I don't know why they thought
that Oreo cookies were made there.
So this is very industrial.
There's no reason
for people to utilize this road
around Staten Island
unless they live right here
or they are coming down here
to get their car fixed
or chopped or whatever.
You got cool old buildings here though.
I love this.
-The North Shore
of Staten Island is very old.
-They just need a little love in them.
-Yeah.
[Sarah] And then over there is
also Howland Hook Marine Terminal
where all of the huge shipping containers
that are coming in
from all over the world,
that is like their first stop.
Port Ivory is the port.
Here's where all the tugboats are.
This is actually pretty cool.
All of the tugboats
for all of New York City.
This is where they go from.
-So the big freighters get through.
They actually did this crazy project
on the bridge where they raised it
to accommodate these mega ships that
were now bringing all of the stuff over.
Waterfront Jersey City
and Manhattan views
and nothing here
but broken down warehouses and stuff.
It's so crazy.
[Peter] This is probably
some of the cheapest real estate
going back on these
residential streets?
Yeah.
-In New York City--
-See look here though.
-Old homes.
Yeah look at this one.
-I love it.
-Oh wow that's cool.
[Peter] It's just so wild
when you say New York City right?
It could be Tribeca.
You could be living in Tribeca.
-Yep.
-You could be living here.
[Sarah] I imagine LA to be similar.
-Totally.
-Where you've got the hills,
that's Los Angeles County.
But actually though
that's Los Angeles County
and not like Los Angeles City.
This is actual city limits.
[Peter] Okay so old factories,
furniture warehouse.
Islamic Center.
[Sarah] That's the Howland Hook Houses.
That's a housing project in here too.
They often do stories about
the poor conditions of the apartments
that they don't keep them
maintained for the residents.
There's no like walkable
shopping area here.
Yeah.
There's nothing here.
And the closest police precinct
is probably 15 minutes away.
It's… you know so it's…
Okay so higher crime
on this part of the island?
Yes.
And what do you think
a home like this costs in these parts?
I mean I think that probably
for you know relative
it's probably still considered expensive.
But I think that you could
probably pick up a home
for $200,000 over here
which for Staten Island it's very low.
-For New York City obviously
and even the country.
The areas that we're heading to
you really can't get anything
for under a million in a single family.
It's insane.
We're coming into Port Ivory now
so you'll see there's really
nothing here at all.
People do like a lot of
illegal dumping here.
-Yeah it's like country roads.
Look how
like nothing's being maintained here.
You're right, yeah.
-The forest is coming over the road.
-Yeah.
[Peter] So this stuff, these are the
containers coming from Europe?
-Yep.
-And so whatever products
are going to hit the shelves wherever?
Or the Amazon warehouses?
-We have an Amazon warehouse here
that they built recently and it is huge.
-And then off to our stores and--
And so here's the abandoned
Ivory Soap factory.
I've been here a couple hours
but potentially a ton of money
could come into Staten Island
and change all of this.
Maybe not directly these port areas
that are very utilitarian and needed
but stuff like that.
I think they try.
So there was a movement
in the early '90s and then again.
Every couple years I feel like
they revive this movement
to secede from New York City.
People try to funnel money
into these areas here
closer to Manhattan but there's so much
red tape and bureaucracy.
It's a part of New York City
and it's just not prioritized
in terms of fund allocation.
Welcome to Staten Island.
-Oh there we go.
-[Sarah laughs]
When you go on a road trip
this is when you know you're back home.
We're going to get out of this though.
The port is busy right now.
This person does…
Thanks A-hole.
Oh and you're from Jersey.
I'm so surprised.
That's how we feel about
all of you guys down in Florida.
[laughs] I bet.
They're trying to get off here
and I'm trying to get over there.
Is he going to let you do it?
Oh he's giving you the wave.
Thank you. I'm trying.
I appreciate you. Thank you.
Sometimes it helps to be a woman
and they'll let you go.
-You think you got some privilege?
-Sometimes.
We are headed up now
to the Todt Hill area of Staten Island.
If you're interested in
like Mafia boss homes
The Godfather was filmed up there.
-Really?
So the Mafia bosses were living up here?
-Well actually… We passed by
the White House.
The Mafia White House.
So if you're familiar with New York Mafia
from like you know the '80s and '90s
Paul Castellano who was the head
of the Gambino Crime Family
he lived in the White House
on Staten Island.
-But a lot of Staten Island
is this though right? Middle class.
-Yes. The average is this. Yes.
-Is there a lot of Staten Island pride?
People love it here?
No. I would say people are prideful
if people from other places
have something to say negative
about Staten Island
but as a collective borough
we're probably pretty self-deprecating.
We all kind of talk about
why we don't like it
and what we wish was different
or where we would like to go
but if somebody were to say
something negative about Staten Island
that wasn't from here
we would be offended by that.
[chuckling]
You understand what I mean?
Like you can't say
anything about it but I can.
Now this is Todt Hill.
This is Ocean Terrace.
I remember thinking as a
kid that that was a palace.
This is a new home
and these homes have
all been here for a good while.
This I call the Kelly Taylor House
'cause that looks like Kelly Taylor
from 90210's house.
With all those like white rails.
-A lot of gaudiness here right?
-Lots of gaudiness.
You're certainly going to see it.
-So what is that?
That's the old-school flamboyant
"Let me show off" stuff going on?
-Yeah. Marble and columns.
So this is the Godfather House.
-This one right here?
-Yep. This is Vito Corleone's house.
-So… it's actually not that big.
-Yeah.
Compared to some of these
other places.
Yeah we're going to see
some major houses.
But yeah that's it.
That's the Godfather House. Nothing…
-It's not crazy at all.
-Not crazy.
We'll head up to the White House.
Yeah this is a…
I can't put a finger on this place.
-[laughing] It's Staten Island.
There's nothing like it.
-Right?
-It is…
My mind is flipping around a little bit.
-Yeah. It's Staten Island.
This house is like
straight out of the Middle East.
They built this pretty recently.
-The Middle East meets America right?
-Lots of Middle East.
-Because the Middle Easterners
go gaudy as it comes
when they have money
and build homes.
Not all of them.
I'm not stereotyping.
You have to travel to the Middle East
to know this which I've done plenty of.
-There's a lot of Middle Eastern doctors.
There's a lot of Albanian money here.
Yeah that's some money. Oh my God!
[Peter] Look, beauty is in
the eye of the beholder.
-[laughs] Sure is.
-It's in the eye of the beholder.
So someone thinks that's
the most beautiful thing ever.
That feels like right outside of
Tirane, Albania.
Yeah exactly.
Okay so now to your left
is the White House.
So this home was originally
owned by Paul Castellano.
The head of the Gambino Crime Family.
Yeah unfortunately
we're not gonna get…
-We can get out and walk around over here.
-Okay let's do it.
This is like New York mafia legend stuff.
He was killed outside of
Spark's Steakhouse in Manhattan.
-Okay.
And this house was wiretapped
by the feds and they…
There are the feds right there.
All Blacked out.
[Sarah chuclkes] Yeah.
It would probably go on
the market for $20 million.
-You think so?
-If it were being listed yeah.
The Zestimate is $18 million
but I would say because of the notoriety
and the amount of stuff
on the house, $20 million.
From here probably a mile and a half
this is all stores and restaurants.
And it used to contain lots and lots of
classic Staten Island businesses,
mom and pops.
But recently it just seems like
everything is written in another language.
[Peter] But it's the story of
big cities in America.
-I guess.
-In America right? The ethnicities turn.
[Sarah] I guess I live in my own
like proverbial bubble.
-Yeah everyone does right?
-I come down here and I'm like when
did every storefront
become a different lang…
Like I don't even remember it happening.
It must've happened so quickly.
So Staten Island is boring right?
[laughter]
I'm here to show you Staten Island.
And I'm here to tell you
that I'm trying to move away.
It's interesting.
-But you need a car here.
-You need a car here.
If you don't have a car here
you're not liking life.
The only way to not have a car here
is to live walking distance to the ferry
and just take the boat in everywhere.
But that's it really.
So like a lot of the classic
Italian restaurants were here.
This is the Lane Theater.
This was a classic movie theater
on Staten Island
for grandparents who grew up here.
Well the Eyeties moved out.
-They went deeper into the burbs right?
Well or deeper south yeah.
Okay.
Staten Island has a lot of
beautiful pockets
of charm and history and culture.
But a lot of it is this.
-Traffic lights and strip malls?
-Yes.
Now we're crossing over
into the South Shore of Staten Island.
This is Gateway National Recreation Area.
So this is a federally maintained…
We're on federal property now.
-What we're looking for
you said off camera
the old Italian guys
tanning up on the beach.
-We're heading there. As long as there's
a hint of sunshine they'll be there.
-Oh there's a guy.
[snickering]
-They'll talk to me no problem.
-Okay.
That is exactly why they do that.
They hope that there's going to get a
wave, someone's going to wave at them.
[Sarah] Ooh it feels nice to be out.
There's a couple of main places
where people will hang out at the beach.
This is one of them.
But the water, it's not the ocean
as you can see. It's like the Raritan.
-Would you swim in there?
-No. Absolutely not.
What's up you guys?
All right. Can I ask you a question?
Stand next to him.
Yeah the microphone will pick it up.
So Jerry,
you lived 40, 50 years here huh?
-Yeah.
-How are things?
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Yeah? All right.
And this guy, you imported from where?
[Sarah laughs]
He imported…
Sheepshead Bay.
Sheepshead Bay. He's imported from
Sheepshead right across the water.
What do you think about
here compared to Brooklyn?
I like the old Brooklyn better
but the way it is now,
I like it here better.
-Chill out on the beach
a little more relaxed or what?
It's just a quieter life and it's nice.
And you my friend where are you from?
I'm from Staten Island
originally from Brooklyn.
Is there a hazing process?
-This is it.
-This is it?
Yeah this is the hazing process.
You have to sit here.
-Are you a cyclist?
No.
I'd fall off a bike
if I tried to ride one.
[Sarah] Your tan is outrageous.
The microphone's right here.
-That is a tan.
-He wants to talk into your microphone.
I gotta tell you, you gotta…
It's a lantern fly.
Yeah the lantern flies.
That's very Staten Island right there.
You're supposed to kill them.
They're invasive from China.
-They're beautiful.
-Yeah they eat the wood
and they're destructive.
They're like termites.
[man] Brooklyn almost every day.
You what?
I still go to Manhattan through
Brooklyn almost every day.
-What are you doing over there?
-He's tanning.
I like to go in the water over there.
So you're a tanning professional?
Fair to say?
Yeah.
-All of you guys.
You even tan in the winter?
[Sarah laughs]
In my backyard.
All right.
So how did you guys meet each other?
Online or you just met down here?
Well I was here for two days.
The painters were still in the house.
I said I'm going to go down
by Great Kills Beach.
I heard there's a bunch of guys
that stay down there like in Brooklyn.
I come down here and I meet everybody
here in two days and that was it.
Rest is history.
There's a bug on your ear.
You can't believe this is a microphone.
-There's a bug inside my head too.
-He's 89.
-Who's this guy up here?
-He's 92.
Who's this good looking guy in the back?
I'm a native Staten Islander.
-You're from here?
-Yes. Born and raised.
Four generations.
You're staying to the end?
All my kids left. All my friends left.
-I'm born and raised as well.
[Peter] People are leaving?
Because they think it's better,
they move to Florida or down South.
The city's getting…
-Am I allowed to curse?
-Say what you want.
It's sh*t, taxes are terrible.
People run to Jersey.
It usually goes like this.
The city, Queens,
Manhattan, everything, Staten Island.
Staten Island goes to Jersey,
Pennsylvania.
And then finally
get the hell out of here.
-Florida. Yep.
-It's a system.
When you fully give up you go to Florida?
I have too many roots here.
What do you do here?
-Sorry?
-You have a business here?
-I'm retired.
-Retired cop you said right?
-Police?
-Yeah.
I have two sons that are on the job.
And I feel very bad about that.
They're getting good money now.
They're making triple
the money I ever saw.
But it's terrible.
They can't be cops anymore.
Anything they do they get sued for it.
The city doesn't protect them.
I don't think it's good to be one
but it's still a very proud thing to do.
-A lot of you guys out
here in Staten Island,
firefighters, police officers.
It's the biggest blue collar section.
In fact when Mamdani came in yesterday
the guy running for mayor
and they chased him off Staten Island.
-Told him get the hell out of here.
-Why is that?
We're predominantly Republican
blue collar workers here.
Cops, firemen, sanitation,
all city workers.
But your vote really
doesn't mean much out here
because you're too
small of a population.
-But it's not going to matter.
-Okay.
If you guys didn't show up to work,
like if nobody went into Manhattan
would the city shut down in a day?
-Or a couple of weeks?
-Hypothetically.
It would hurt it.
-It would hurt it?
-Yeah.
You notice they put speed cameras
and all these cameras all over.
'Cause cops don't want to
give tickets out there anymore.
So they put all these cameras
to get revenue to make up the difference.
Every corner lot now has a camera.
-Speed camera and red light camera.
Now they're coming out
with stop light cameras.
-Oh my God.
Well the whole island is on camera now.
-Oh that sucks.
-Yeah.
-There's no cat and mouse game
with speeding anymore?
Nah. They just have the radars.
Why? If you stop the guy
they're going to let him go anyway.
Unless of course,
there's an accident and someone's hurt.
-Gotcha. Gotcha.
-Yeah that car is overturned.
-Sure is.
-Looks like this guy just came out of it.
-Right.
Looks like he's walking fine.
Pulling it apart.
So the firefighters working in Manhattan
actually live this far away?
Yeah. It's a tough lifestyle
to live here and commute
like say to Midtown even Downtown.
But that is a sacrifice
a lot of people are willing to make
to live in the city limits
but have a suburban lifestyle.
My commute started here
'cause this is where the train station is.
So that would be 90 minutes from here
to Midtown from when I got on the train.
If you were driving at
4:00 in the morning
and there were no traffic whatsoever
from Staten Island
you should be downtown in 35 minutes.
-Oh really?
-Yeah.
-It's only like 9 miles.
-It's not--
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.
-Feels so far away.
-I know.
It feels far away
because it takes forever.
Especially if you're taking the boat.
 This is Annadale Town. So this is
the town that I grew up coming to.
It looks sort of the same.
-Cute little place.
-Yeah.
So each South Shore neighborhood
has a little town like this
This is an institution on Staten Island,
the Dove Diner. The Golden Dove.
Everybody who grew up in this area
or on this South Shore
has been to this diner.
-You can go I think.
-Is it a right on red?
There's no right on red in New York City.
-Oh you can't right on red?
Are you serious?
-I'm serious.
-Since when?
-Always.
-Really?
-New York City, there's no right on red.
Even out here?
Even out here.
-I understand when you have
a bunch of one-ways maybe.
No right on red in New York City
unless there's a sign
that specifically says
you can make a right on red
but usually those signs
will say not during the week
during school hours it's such a…
You can't make a right on red
in New York City.
And cops know that most people
don't know that
that are from here
so they take advantage of that.
-This is your average neighborhood?
-Mm-hmm.
This is the middle class?
It's hard to…
I don't even know
what is considered middle anymore.
-If you're a nurse right,
that's a good middle class job right?
-Probably paid pretty well.
I have a higher paying specialty.
-So on that salary though
you could afford…
Say if it was just you.
Yeah which it is
because my husband is disabled.
Oh okay.
So which is a… that's a whole nother…
Going through that process,
the disability process,
that is a nightmare and a half.
You could do a whole
freaking video on that.
-Story on--
-Holy sh*t.
What, getting health care
assistance or something?
Not even health care assistance but an
actual disabled person that can't work.
My husband became disabled
permanently in 2021.
He has intractable epilepsy
due to a traumatic brain injury.
His traumatic brain injury
occurred in 1994 when he was 15.
He was in a head-on collision
here on Staten Island.
It was like front page of the newspaper.
His ambulance went under
police escort to the hospital
and then he had
a nine-hour craniotomy.
As a 41-year-old
he developed epilepsy.
That was not in control
for two to three years.
I had actually…
I didn't work for a year.
I actually didn't work last year.
I had to take a leave
to stay home to care for him.
-Oh wow.
And he had a business.
A construction business.
He was a general contractor
with his brother and he had a…
He was no longer able to work at all.
There would be times where he didn't even
know like our home address or like…
-It was…
-Oh wow. That's stressful.
Yeah.
We became a one-salary household
and it should be enough
to live comfortably
but it just isn't anymore.
If you go to a Manhattan hospital
you're going to make more money
but the cost of living here
is very, very high.
The Social Security disability that
we pay into as a tax-paying society,
it is such a frustrating process.
And they just don't want to give it.
And you have to hire an attorney
to go through that process.
They deny everybody
pretty much on the first shot.
That's how they I guess weed out
who's serious about it and who's not.
When you finally do get it
it's a little pittance every single month.
And that was happening for us
during a time where
our city was welcoming illegal immigrants
with housing and like $2,000 gift cards.
And we were
very much
struggling at that time
and we couldn't understand
why as tax-paying citizens
that have been here our whole lives
why we had to
jump through such hoops to get,
you know, this aid
that was very much needed.
We were having trouble making sure
our mortgage was paid every month.
And we just felt like we could have used
some of those gift cards.
The welcome baskets of gift cards
that they were giving.
-Right.
-I don't know. I mean like I…
Well I spent a lot of time
on the border during those years.
-Was it just New York City?
-No, no it was Chicag--
I don't even know if it
was just New York City
that was offering
those like incentives to come and like…
They were putting them
up in luxury hotels.
-Yeah, the Roosevelt right?
-Yeah.
There's so much to talk about on that one.
I've made actually
tons of videos on the border
showing the situation from
where the problem was starting right?
But no, it wasn't just New York City.
Not at all.
And so for example in Chicago
the police stations were fully packed
with migrants when I was there.
So actually walking in the police station
there's just kids playing around
and migrants taking over
the whole station, the lobby areas.
It's just these cities were overwhelmed
and just didn't know how to manage.
And like were not prepared
and not really forward-thinking
at all with this stuff.
And then people will mention well they
shouldn't have sent them to these cities.
Well they wanted to go to these cities, A.
And B, there are plenty of towns all over
America that dealt with migrant influxes.
And school districts,
hospitals, didn't know how to cope.
Yeah.
'Cause you have a huge influx of people,
how do you deal with that?
For example Yuma County,
the hospital there,
this woman wanted to give birth.
"Sorry you gotta go to Phoenix
two hours away."
You know 'cause hospitals take, you know,
they take on the most acute care.
Doesn't matter if you have insurance
or your nationality
or your legality status or anything.
Right. You can't be turned away
at the emergency room.
-You can't be turned away.
-And that's…
-That's a good thing right?
-Fine. Of course.
It's what they're there for.
But when you flood the country
with the numbers that it just can't handle
then you're going to have problems.
Yeah. When you do
finally get the judgment that
you're approved for disability
and, you know,
it's supposed to start
at the diagnosis date.
Which for my husband that was in
January of 2021.
Retroactive payout did not come until…
It was 2025.
-Oh geez.
[Peter] "Joe and Pat's established 1960."
[Sarah] Here we are.
-So we're going to do slices
right from each place?
Yeah. Plain slices.
No pepperoni, nothing?
You can if you're gonna… but then you
gotta judge it pepperoni over there too.
I'm going to go pepperoni.
[Peter] All right. So pizza number one.
-That's an interesting house.
-Oh she's out there.
Nice she's wearing a Barbie shirt. Yeah.
-[Peter] Hey place looks great.
-Thank you.
-So cool.
-I live right near here.
I drive past here all the time.
I love it.
How long have you been doing
the Barbie house for?
-Oh, last year I started.
-We're doing a video on Staten Island.
-Perfect. Very nice.
-Yeah cool.
Okay so what inspired this?
I know Barbie inspired you.
Lie the shirt says, "Think of me as
the Barbie you'll never get to play with."
-I love that.
-To the clowns out there.
You don't wear that
for your boyfriend do you?
-No I'm single, ready to mingle.
-Oh you're single.
You're ready to mingle?
-Okay but you're very selective.
-But on my terms though.
But you're gonna have to compromise
if you want a good guy.
A little bit. You don't want a yes man.
You'll get tired of them.
-I want someone that's fair,
and smart, and loyal, and very caring.
-And you feel secure with.
-Yeah.
Nobody that's gonna be disrespectful
because that's like the first thing.
-Trust and respect is everything.
Lying, I don't stand for that.
-Okay.
-No.
-This is cool.
-Do you have an Instagram page?
I have only like my own personal account.
[Sarah] You should
make an account for this.
To be honest it would be a headache
to constantly block, delete people.
I already have like an OnlyFans page too.
-Oh.
-You do?
-Whoa.
-Okay.
Imagine the amount
of weird creepy things I see.
So imagine having this too. I'll be
like my freaking head will pop open.
And you got you got
a camera there so no creepers can…
-To protect and preserve the Barbie house.
-Okay.
-At all times.
-Oh my God.
We're comfortable here.
I'm Sarah, Crissy. It's nice to meet you.
-Peter. Yeah.
-Peter, Sarah.
-Christina, Christina.
-I love it.
You guys are awesome.
Thank you for letting us use your stoop.
This is this is a great backdrop.
-Sure is.
-All right.
Feel free anytime you're around
you always feel welcome.
I drive past here every day.
Use the table anytime.
Oh you're so sweet. Thank you.
-All right. Let's try it. Here we go.
-All right. Got our Joe & Pat's.
-So we're going we're going thin crust.
-Yup.
Very thin crust. Very thin crust.
-Heavy. I mean the crust is cracking.
-Yup.
-And very heavy on the pepperoni.
-Yup.
Mmm.
-And this is your favorite Staten Island?
-Mm-hmm.
Here I'm going to give you the camera.
All right.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
It's good.
Heavy on the sauce.
-Lighter--
-It's a sweet sauce too.
It's a sweet sauce, lighter on the cheese.
Yes the mozzarella is dotted on there.
It's not like the stringy shredded cheese.
They use cubes and they dot them on there.
They're going with cubes.
I mean only if you really love pepperoni.
-Because they packed it.
-They do but they're little.
You can see the flour
on the bottom of the crust.
Little burnt edges which is nice right?
-The crust is… I love that.
You get that crunch.
Mm-hmm.
Okay I'm going to remember this.
-I'm remembering.
-Okay.
And I could eat probably four of these.
They're so little.
-[Peter] You don't drive?
-[Chrissy] No.
I'm not comfortable with it
and I think it's completely fine.
It's not for everybody.
And if someone's going to judge you
then that's not the person
you want to be around.
-Do people judge on you
if you don't drive really?
I mean some guys do
but that's because maybe they're lazy.
-They don't want to pick you up.
-Don't want to spend their gas money?
Oh jeez. Is chivalry dead?
-I wouldn't say so.
-Okay good.
[Peter] Chairs being pulled doors opened.
Yes.
[Peter] That's so easy to do.
Buy flowers once in a while
which I got to do more of.
-Oh I love flowers.
-Yeah who doesn't?
But my wife likes the flowers
that I don't like
so I buy what I don't like
and she likes them.
Did you grow up in Staten Island?
-I grew up in this house.
-Wow. That's cool.
What's your take
on Staten Island these days?
I think Staten Island people
are very judgmental very aggressive.
I wouldn't even say assertive anymore.
I think people are very aggressive lately.
-Just straight up aggressive?
-I don't want to live here anymore.
Okay. Do you agree with that?
I mean I think that…
judgmental is the
religion here on Staten Island.
-Oh really?
So when did it start changing or was it
always aggressive and judgmental?
It was always like that.
-Always?
-Yeah.
Even when I was younger
I always felt that tension, that energy
because my personality is not New York.
I'm very down to earth. I'm very humble.
I'm actually very nice,
very quiet to myself,
like a bit of an introvert I would say.
Even though looking at
me you would never think that
I'm actually an introvert.
-Okay.
What's your take on Manhattan
or the rest of the city?
-Do you like it or…
-Um not really. No.
No? Okay. You're Miami bound.
You're going to Miami?
Yeah, exactly.
[Peter] Okay here we go.
Denino's.
[Sarah] Denino's.
All right Denino's doesn't do slices.
-I guess after a certain time
they stop doing slices but are you ready?
-Yeah.
We're going a little thicker
with the crust.
Some Blackness which is nice.
Some charcoal.
-It's a nice hot piece.
Pepperonis are different.
[bar chatter]
Yeah.
-I gotta say.
-That's the one.
For me. What about you?
-It's…
-Are you still holding on to your…
-I mean listen.
-Joe & Pats?
I'm going to take another couple bites.
I have to say
it is piping hot which I love.
It's almost like they knew
that we were judging or something.
Because it's like the most perfect
Denino's slice I think I've ever had.
-Oh.
Converting me.
I like the sweetness
of the Joe & Pat's sauce.
-Better sauce over there.
-Yes.
-Yes.
-Cheesier.
-It's definitely cheesier.
They have the stringy cheese on this.
This is a dinner.
This is more substantial pizza.
Yeah.
-Some people like a tangy sauce.
I love a sweet sauce.
But you're right.
That's a better light summer pizza midday.
-Yes.
You're not going to feel heavy afterwards.
-For me the sauce is everything.
-That's true. That's a good point.
-It depends the mood you're in.
-I'm going to take the crust now.
It depends on what you're looking for
but certainly a light summery slice,
Joe & Pat's.
-Thank you Sarah. That was cool.
-Thank you.
It was as cool as it could be
on Staten Island.
New York's forgotten borough.
-Will you ever forget?
-I'll never forget.
That was cool.
A lot of detail here.
It's way bigger than I thought it was.
We did a lot of driving today.
You didn't see because the camera was off.
But I just love the fact
and I know it's quite obvious
but we're still in New York City.
We are.
And it's like we're almost in
another state or another country.
Yeah, almost like another country.
It feels like
a totally different experience.
And so I love when you can do that
'cause I'll go back to Manhattan tonight
and that's what makes travel cool.
And you never know until you go.
-It's true.
-Yeah.
And now you will know that
there's probably no reason
for you to ever come back.
-Come on come on Sarah.
-[laughs]
You were great.
I'm just joking.
Anything else you want to say?
I want to say that I'm so…
Not only am I so excited to see
a Peter Santenello YouTube video
about Staten Island but that I
for some lucky reason got to be the one.
No thank you.
To walk you around here.
Drive you around rather.
Because a place like Staten Island
there's no way I'd be able
to navigate this on my own.
No. How could you?
It's too large.
I wouldn't know where to go.
And uh…
How could you?
Awesome.
-Thanks so much.
-And so Joe & Pat's or Denino's?
-Denino's for sure.
-Yeah. I knew you thought that way.
All right guys.
Thanks for coming along on that journey.
I Have two other videos
from New York City, this trip.
Check those out.
They're around here somewhere.
-Sarah, thank you.
-Thank you, Peter.
All right guys. Until the next one.
