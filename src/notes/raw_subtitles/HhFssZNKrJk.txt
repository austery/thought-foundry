>> In 1998, Canada celebrated
a huge milestone. We became
one of the first countries in
the world to eliminate measles.
27 years later, things are
dramatically different.
And that's because one year ago,
in New Brunswick, measles made
a reappearance. What started as
one case quickly spread across
the country and has continued
to spread for a full year.
Now pay attention to that one
year mark because it's
important.
According to public health, if
the chain of transmission can't
be broken in a year, it means
a country can no longer call
itself measles-free.
Canada's status will officially
be determined at a meeting
next month. Now, we have had
outbreaks since 1998, but we've
always been able to break the
chain of transmission.
But not this time. Spread has
been slowing, but it's still
making headlines like possible
exposures this month in Ottawa
and Alberta recently reported
its first measles death since
the outbreak began. So how did
we get here and what would it
take to make measles a disease
of the past? Again, welcome to
"The Rundown." Measles is the
most contagious disease in the
world, so how can we stop the
spread? In the latest episode
of Unravel the TVO series that
unravels key issues happening
in Ontario and across the
country, producer Sangeeta
Patel takes a look at herd
immunity and how we build it.
>> Diseases never really
disappear. They just stop
spreading because we make it
harder for them. That's the
idea behind herd immunity.
When a community is protected
from infectious diseases because
they can't easily spread from
person to person. So how do we
actually get herd immunity?
Herd immunity has been a big
goal of public health ever
since vaccines were invented.
The idea is when enough people
get vaccinated, or they've
already had the disease and
built up some immunity from it,
it stops the spread. But here's
the thing some diseases can
reinfect people. So really,
the ultimate goal isn't herd
immunity. It's elimination
where we get rid of the disease
from the community altogether.
Experts suggest the way of
doing that is to vaccinate
everyone who can safely get the
shot. That way, we're not just
protecting ourselves, we're
protecting newborns, people
with weakened immune systems,
and the elderly, too.
And Canada's actually done this
before. We've eliminated
diseases like smallpox and
polio. But like any chain,
we're only as strong as our
weakest link. And when it comes
to measles, we've lost our gold
standard elimination status.
We earn that back in 1998,
thanks to our strong public
health and vaccination program.
So if we lose that collective
protection, what happens then?
Well, disease can spread through
the community again.
And with something like measles,
it spreads fast. It has a really
high infection rate, especially
because it's airborne.
That means if you come into
contact with someone who has it,
there's a really good chance
you'll get it too. And it's not
just the infection itself
that's the problem. Measles can
lead to complications.
Things like respiratory failure,
brain swelling, hearing loss,
vision loss, or even death.
So here's the bottom line herd
immunity isn't just a science
term, it's a social contract.
Vaccinations can not only
protect the person getting the
shot, but others in the
community as well by preventing
the spread.
Because the moment we let our
guard down, diseases remind us
they've never really gone away.
They've just been waiting for
an opening.
>> Since Canada officially
eliminated measles in 1998.
We've had outbreaks, but never
one like this. So how did this
outbreak get bad enough for us
to lose our elimination status,
and where did it come from?
Those questions took the Globe
and Mail's Nathan Vanderklippe
from Thailand to New Brunswick
to Texas. I sat down with
Nathan and immunologist
Dr. Dawn Bowdish to find out
what we can learn from tracing
the virus.
Dawn, thank you so much for
joining us in our temporary
studios, and Nathan, for
joining us on the line from
Spain. Dawn, it's been one year
since the measles broke out in
Canada, causing the country to
lose its measles elimination
status. It sounds like a pat on
the back for a lot of us that
that was something that that we
held. But break it down.
What does that actually mean?
>> Well, it means we're on a
list of countries that are torn
apart by war or that don't have
good public health, and none of
our G7 contemporaries are on
that list. It shows that there
were multiple systems that
broke down to have this happen,
and it also shows that we have
a lot of work to do, because if
we haven't been able to shut
down these outbreaks in a year,
it shows that we're going to
have to invest a lot in our
public health system so that
this stops and ends and doesn't
happen again.
>> I think I know the answer
to this, but avoidable.
>> Completely avoidable.
I mean, we had that that status
for almost 20 some odd years.
And and the only way to get out
of a measles outbreak is to
have everyone vaccinated.
It's just that contagious.
And every time a new baby is
born, we've got new vulnerable
people in our population.
So our focus is going to have
to be on getting those
vaccination rates back up
to get off that really
problematic list.
>> When we talk about
vaccination, let's be clear.
What is the the rate if someone
gets the vaccine, can they is
it 100%?
>> No, it's not 100%.
But as with most vaccines, if
you are vaccinated, it's thought
that it will modify the disease,
make it less severe. So, yes,
there are cases of adults who
got vaccinated a long time ago,
but most of the cases, over 90%
of the cases are in either
people who never were
vaccinated or people who were
only had one dose hadn't got
that second dose yet.
>> Nathan, you travelled
40,000 kilometres around the
world to track how measles got
to North America.
Before we get into where
you actually went,
my question is why?
>> Because as Dawn just
described, we're at a really
interesting and important
moment in public health for
Canada. And I think if you look
at some of the things that led
us to this moment in public
health, I think they are part
and parcel of some of the other
major developments that we have
in our society right now.
I don't know that what is
happening in public health is
is out of step with what's
happening in our politics.
And I think there's a there's
a lot of questions about why
that is and what is happening.
And it just felt like maybe in
this one particular instance, we
could find out how it happened.
And maybe in finding out how it
happened, maybe it helps us to
understand things just that
much better.
>> Dawn, before we get into
sort of Nathan's travel journey
to tell the story, is this
outbreak something that we can
come back from as a country and
as a province? Most recently,
Ontario just earlier this month
was clear of of measles sort of
cases. But we got to recent new
ones last week.
Can we come back from this?
>> Well, remember we were
living in a measles free
country for a long time.
But it takes resources and that
includes resourcing public
health. One of the challenges
with this outbreak is that
pockets of people are being
unvaccinated.
And those pockets of people,
for various complicated reasons,
are choosing not to get
vaccinated.
And they need people they can
trust to speak to them and help
them make those decisions.
We have to invest a lot of money
in making public health
accessible to those people as
well. There are major, major
structural issues that are
going to require major
governmental resources.
So, for example, in Ontario, our
chief medical officer just made
a case for having a vaccine
registry. I cannot tell you how
many people I've spoken to who
think they might have got
measles vaccinated,
maybe weren't sure.
>> The conversation earlier
with some colleagues about it.
Yeah.
>> How do you look it up?
You know, and if you've switched
family doctors, if you've moved
provinces, I mean, really what
would be helpful would make us
sort of comparable to the other
G7 countries, would be having
a national vaccine registry.
That's complicated because our
provinces administer our health
care. But I'd settle for a
provincial, you know, every
province having one of these.
So at least we would know where
people weren't vaccinated.
And at least people could be
proactive in getting vaccinated.
Of course, the other feature
that will require time and
effort is the family doctor
crisis. Childhood vaccines are
not given in pharmacies.
They're given in the family
doctor's clinic. And if you
don't have one, it becomes the
parent's job to somehow find
a public health clinic or find
a way for their kids to get
vaccinated. That's a lot of
work for working parents who
have a lot of other challenges
in this economy.
>> All right. Now that we've
established sort of where we
are right now, I want to go
back in time. Nathan 2020 4th
October. Where did this
outbreak begin here in Canada?
>> Well, we first heard about
this outbreak when we had
public health authorities in
New Brunswick. Describe a
couple of initial cases that
took place there. They put out
a warning. Warning. You know,
if you are at a local hospital
between this and this time,
perhaps you were exposed.
They said there was a large
family gathering, and then they
moved quite quickly to set up
a couple of pop up vaccination
clinics in rural New Brunswick.
From there, it took some time
for more information to come
out, but we learned eventually
from public health authorities
in Canada that there was a
measles case that had come on
a flight from Manilla, which is
what they said, Manilla and
into Canada and then across
Canada and to New Brunswick.
And then, of course, you know,
shortly after we had those
first case and cases in New
Brunswick, we started to see
a large number of cases in
Ontario as well. And from there,
if you track it, it sort of
there's you can we put it on
a map for, for our website.
And it's just little pinpricks
like fireworks coming up across
the continent.
As, as these cases spread.
>> I want to get a better
understanding of the the family
that you spoke with. The first
case in New Brunswick and also
the the hospital and the
doctors that were working with
them. How did they react when
they realised that they were
dealing with measles? As we
mentioned, it's been 20 plus
years. You know, perhaps some
doctors are not familiar with
seeing it. Perhaps it's
something in a textbook.
But how did they react?
>> Well, at first with
confusion, and I think that was
true for everyone who was
involved. Certainly in the
first few days, you had this
Canadian woman who who flew to
Canada from Asia, from Thailand,
as it turns out, not from not
from the Philippines. She began
to grow, feel unwell on the
flight, but she had an absolute
gruelling set of flights,
numerous legs of her flight
journey to Canada and thought,
well, listen, you know, it's
jet lag, it's I'm tired and,
you know, like anybody would be
with, with that many flights.
She takes an Advil.
She's coming home for her
sister's wedding. She's excited.
There's a delay.
She makes it the night before.
And so she gets up the morning
of the wedding.
She's not feeling well.
Her throat is sore, and.
But she pops an Advil and says,
you know, I'm gonna get through
this because she's crossed the
globe to attend her sister's
wedding.
And and then after the wedding,
she starts to feel unwell again.
And she goes to the hospital.
And the doctor who sees her
looks and she's.
She has a rash. She has a fever,
she has a sore throat. And and
if you're a doctor, you see
a lot of people with rashes,
fevers and sore throats,
and you see them with those for
very understandable reasons.
And so the first the first
diagnoses, the first guesses at
diagnoses were not the measles.
In fact, measles didn't come up
for several days, as best we
can understand. There was a
thought maybe since you're
coming from Southeast Asia,
maybe you have scarlet fever.
Maybe it's strep throat.
The woman's son had recently had
strep throat, and so they sent
her home with some antibiotics.
And so she actually went back
from the hospital on the day,
the day of the wedding,
and went back home for
a couple of days.
>> Dawn, I know we are coming
off the heels of Covid, but it
is still remarkable when when
Nathan's talking about, you
know, this map lighting up with
all the cases of how this all
started with really one person,
can you help us understand how
one person contact the virus
can turn a whole nation upside
down in terms of an outbreak.
>> Measles is the most
infectious, most contagious
virus we know of, the most
infectious. And so that means
that any pocket of
vulnerability, it's easy for it
to spread through. And again,
the fact that a lot of people,
there are pockets of people who
weren't vaccinated, so many
people who attended that
wedding weren't vaccinated.
And then they all travelled back
to their various home cities and
countries. And of course,
many of their friends and
neighbours weren't vaccinated.
And then those people travelled.
And so it speaks to two things.
The one is there is no way out
of this other than vaccination.
It is so contagious that
no amount of healthy living
or even the contact tracing
and all those things
that we have to do
can get us out of this
because it will just spread
faster than we have
the resources to stop it.
But it also shows how important
making sure that we have
consistent vaccination all over
the country. Because when there
are those pockets of people,
it's really, really easy for it
to spread. And of course,
humans don't stay still.
After we saw some of these small
communities in southwestern
Ontario, I remember my heart
and stomach dropping when I saw
that one of the exposure sites
was Ripley's Aquarium, a major
tourist centre in Toronto.
Right, because you know, anyone
who would have been there,
it would be impossible to trace.
All the people who were there
would now be vulnerable.
So this just really speaks to
the fact that there is no way
out other than vaccination.
>> Nathan from rural New
Brunswick. You end up in a
small Texan city population,
what, 7 or 8000 people?
Tell me how that journey began.
>> Well, I think anybody paying
attention in Canada and
certainly anybody involved in
public health in Canada would,
would obviously have noticed
all of these cases that that
emerged in Ontario. But but I
think where we started to get
a much larger international
spotlight on this outbreak was
when we started to get hundreds
of cases in Texas, and those
cases in Texas began to appear
at a really fractious political
moment as well. I mean, some of
the first cases were reported
there within days of Donald
Trump returning to the White
House. We had a whole new set
of people in positions of
authority in the United States.
We had we had a health
secretary who had a history of
of casting doubt on vaccines
and all the rest. And right at
that very moment, you had a,
you know, a major outbreak of
measles taking place in Texas,
which of course, is itself a
conservative state. And so, you
know, that that was when you
had CNN live trucks operating
in sort of this small town.
And that's when I think you got
a lot of attention on it.
And there were a number of
indicators that what had
happened in Texas had a link to
what had happened in Canada.
There were there were some
reporting on genotyping that
suggested we were looking at a
similar virus. But what I found
really interesting was that
nobody seemed to understand how
it got there. And and that was
true of people in public health.
That was true of doctors.
I spoke with the doctor who
treated the first case there.
She had no idea how it got
there. The local public health
officials had no clue how it
got there. They were like, well,
we think it came from Canada,
but we don't know for sure.
And so I was interested in
seeing whether it was possible
to to at least shed some light
on how it may have come all
the way to, you know,
far northwestern Texas,
from from Ontario.
And we're talking about places
that are thousands of kilometres
apart from each other.
>> Can you shed some light into
that? Why is it that federal
authorities and local
authorities had no idea?
>> Well, it wasn't for lack of
trying. I mean, they asked the
question, but we were we're
looking at and I think there's
this this is a really important
thing to bear in mind when you
think about what we're at with
measles right now. We are in
this very long and sometimes
very dark shadow of Covid and
and the experiences that people
had with Covid, particularly
around vaccines, around
mandates for vaccines, around
the impact that mandates for
vaccines had on the lives of
some who refused to have those
vaccines around. The contact
with the mechanisms of public
health, which I think can be
uncomfortable. Contact tracing
is uncomfortable. You know,
somebody from the government
calls and says, you know, where
have you been?
Who have you talked to that
that's uncomfortable.
And I think, you know, that was
fresh in people's minds.
And there was a sense that that
what had taken place around
Covid was destructive.
And so then the measles comes
and suddenly all of these
familiar and unwanted
mechanisms start to gear back
up again. Hi. I'm calling to
contact trace and people like,
no, sorry, I want nothing to do
with this. And that was the
answer for a lot of the public
health authorities in Texas.
Where did this come from? No, I
don't know don't want to talk.
And so there were not a lot of
answers that came out.
>> Don, that poses some
challenges for health officials.
How do you guys work to figure
out those gaps? But also I'm
also going to put in there, you
know, you talked a little bit
about sort of vulnerable
communities, but communities
that may have reservations,
whether it's cultural beliefs,
religious beliefs, simply
misinformation.
>> There's this mantra of
public health, which is, you
know, you have to go to where
the people are, and it's
helpful to have trusted leaders
in those spaces. So one of the
things we really need are
people who have extra training
about vaccines in general.
So there's lots of people who
have a blanket. No, but once
they have a trusted leader,
have that discussion with them
and sort of talk about risks
and benefits and ways that they
can understand. Most people
actually are movable. There's
very few people who are hard.
No, once they get the answers
to their questions. But I think
it's also really important to
understand that it's fine for
parents to have conversations
with their doctors about this.
There are very few things we
would expect people to just
blindly accept from their
doctor, and one of the
challenges in the vaccine space
is doctors don't often have a
lot of training in some of the
really nuanced questions.
You know, I'll just give you
an example. A colleague of mine
runs a vaccine hesitancy clinic
and got referred to a family
who wasn't getting their
measles vaccine. Turns out that
kid had a deadly egg allergy
and no one could tell
them. Was the measles vaccine
like the flu shot where it's
made in eggs? Right?
That is not an unreasonable
conversation to want to have.
So what would be incredibly
helpful if we had nurse
practitioners, doctors,
pharmacists, people who are
embedded in the community have
these training to have these
really advanced conversations
with people. And again, that
takes time and money and
political effort.
But that would be a big help in
getting over some of this
misinformation.
>> Nathan, knowing what you
know about how easily measles
can spread, do you think this
changes the broader attitudes
towards vaccinations?
>> So one of the interesting
things, because I asked people,
you know, were you vaccinated?
It wasn't the focus of my
reporting, but I was just kind
of curious because I was
curious about why not. And and
the answer I got more than
anything was not rooted in
conspiracy or some of the other
things that we tend to
associate with vaccine
hesitancy. For most people,
the answer was, well, isn't
the measles gone? Like, why
do we need to get vaccinated?
It just it felt like an
unnecessary medical intervention
for a disease that was
no longer with us.
And I think the corollary
to that was there are numbers
of people who thought, well,
listen, even if the measles
isn't gone, you know, like my
mom went through this, my
grandparents went through this.
They survived. They were fine.
And so there there was a I
think a and this is very human,
but but a forgetting of what
the seriousness of measles
could be. And I saw this in one
way, which was in Texas. People
spoke about some of the
symptoms of the measles, and
they were like, yeah. And this
was where actually things got
into conspiracy because people
were like, oh, you know, this
was an unusual strain of
measles. Something was wrong
here. People had hallucinations.
And other thing like that never
happened. You know, in my, my
parents and my grandparents had
it. Well, as it turns out,
it did. If you look in the
literature around measles, this
is one of the symptoms that can
be associated with measles.
But it's been forgotten because
the measles had been relegated
to the dust of time.
>> We are going to leave it
there, Nathan.
Dawn, really appreciate it.
Really insightful stuff.
Thank you so much.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you.
>> Remember the early days of
Covid when people would wait
impatiently for the latest news
conference from Ontario's Chief
Medical Officer of health?
Maybe that was just me, but the
pandemic pushed public health
agencies into the spotlight
and now, over five years later,
we might not be waiting
breathlessly for public health
updates anymore. But that
spotlight has never really gone
away, especially with the
return of things like measles.
I wanted to know more about
the pressures public health
agencies are facing. So I sat
down with Dr. Trevor Arnason,
medical officer of health at
Ottawa Public Health.
Dr. Arnison, thank you so much
for joining us on the program.
You are officially three months
into your new position as
Ottawa's medical officer of
health. Congratulations on that.
Let's talk about public health
and its role. Let's talk 2025.
I'm sure there are standard
practices that you have to
employ just across the board.
But I am curious are there any
new approaches? Having looked
at the last couple of years
coming off the heels of Covid
into a measles outbreak, but is
there any new approaches just
in general, when we talk about
public health on the local
level that you want to sort of
play to?
>> So we are we are going
through a renewal of the
Ontario public Health standards
in Ontario. So this is the
provincial standards that guide
our work and what we do.
I think for me, what's top of
mind in the past few months
starting this new rule is how
information and the information
space is really affecting how
people are approaching health
issues. My background working
as an associate medical officer
of health has largely been in
vaccinations and being involved
in the Covid 19 vaccination
rollout. We're seeing a lot of
misinformation around vaccines,
but also other all other health
related issues and and
treatments. There's a lot of
information being shared on the
internet right now and in
social media.
>> Well, let's pick up on
the misinformation and
disinformation. Help me
understand when you are around
the table with your colleagues
trying to figure out the proper
messaging, how are you cutting
through the noise?
>> Yeah, so a lot of it is
related to basic communications
approaches. A lot of it is
trying to understand where
people are getting their
information and how best we can
speak to people so that they
that we're listening and seen
as a a trusted partner.
We've seen a lot of mistrust and
and lack of trust for from
traditional government
institutions on on issues like
vaccination. And similarly,
we see that people less and less
have access to a trusted
healthcare provider in Ontario
who they can speak to about
issues at the individual level.
So what we've been trying to do
is engage the community and
understand what some of the
barriers are to getting the
appropriate information.
>> Now, you had mentioned your
background. You were also part
of Ottawa's Covid 19 task force.
Also very important to note
that around that time in 2022,
Ottawa was being occupied.
There was a convoy that was
downtown quite busy.
And I imagine part of the
messaging is also understanding
who you are sort of fighting
against or trying to, you know,
where those other messages are
coming from.
And I'm curious, who do you
point the finger at for some of
the misinformation and
disinformation around vaccine
hesitancy for example?
>> You know, I've been working
in the vaccine space for for a
very long time, and I, I would
I would be hesitant to actually
say that a lot of the. Myths
around vaccination have have
changed substantially over the
past few decades. Even if we go
back to the, you know, 1800s.
And when vaccines started, a
lot of the same concerns about
vaccines that are raised today
are similar. So the the. The
real difference in our society,
I think, is where people are
getting their information and
how the information is flowing
and who's being seen as trusted
voices of information and what
the motivations behind
misinformation and
disinformation is.
>> Dr. Arneson, very quickly,
I do want to pivot a little bit
about measles for last year.
That was the focus. And, you
know, there was hope that
Ontario had it under control.
But there were two cases that
were discovered in Ottawa,
and I am curious about the
conversation around exemptions,
whether it's religious,
philosophical, is that
worsening the vaccine hesitancy?
Is that adding fuel to the fire?
>> So certainly vaccine
hesitancy is the is is a cause
of what we're seeing, the issue
around people choosing not to
vaccinate for measles, mumps,
rubella is certainly a cause of
why we're seeing people with
measles and spread of measles
within the province. Now, what
we're seeing is that people are
not familiar with the disease
and in many cases are not
getting vaccinated. And that's
a number of a number of factors.
It's not always related to
specific religious beliefs.
Again, it could be related to
misinformation that people are
hearing through social media
or other other forms of
communication. And it could
also be, in some cases, access
issues when it comes to
exemptions. What we're talking
about is in Ontario, the
Immunisation of School Pupils
Act, which is an act for
reporting vaccines to attend
school, which is an important
tool in in trying to make sure
that people are up to date.
But it's it's not necessarily a
perfect tool. People can choose
those exemptions.
We haven't seen massive
increases in exemptions.
However, you know, we do see
challenges with people being
able to report their records
year over year and especially
during the pandemic when school
was disrupted for periods of
time and getting that
information and also people's
access to healthcare services
were disrupted.
We did see a decrease in in
vaccination of some of these
important immunisations that
we're still seeing
catch up with. So really the
the fundamental issue is
getting people to understand
the importance of routine
vaccination and getting the
vaccinations. And there's a
variety of, of, of barriers or
reasons that that might not be
happening as much as it once
was.
>> We are going to leave it
there. Dr. Arneson, really
appreciate your time and your
input.
>> Thanks very much.
>> And that's it for us here at
"The Rundown." Like our studio,
this show is a work in progress
and we want your input. Send an
email to therundown@tvo.org or
DM me on Instagram
@jeyanjeganathan and let us
know what you think is working
or not working so far.
See you tomorrow!
