I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 experiencing


their
 leisure
 time
 by
 dumping
 their


attention
 into
 their
 phone.
 And
 as


they're
 flicking
 through
 Tik
 Tok
 and


they're
 flicking
 through
 Instagram,


they're
 thinking
 dopamine
 hit,
 dopamine


hit,
 dopamine
 hit.
 And
 what
 happens


sometimes
 when
 we
 experience
 a
 really


high
 dopamine
 period
 is
 that
 our
 reserve


levels,
 our
 so-called
 tonic
 levels
 of


dopamine
 drop.
 And
 so
 we're
 spending
 all


this
 time
 on
 our
 phones.
 We
 put
 our


phone
 down
 and
 we're
 like
 a
 little


exhausted.
 Maybe
 a
 friend
 texts
 at
 that


very
 moment
 and
 says,
 "Hey,
 you
 want
 to


get
 a
 drink?
 Hey,
 you
 want
 to
 get


dinner?
 Hey,
 you
 want
 to
 just
 hang
 out


outside
 the
 house
 and
 what
 populates
 in


our
 head
 is
 all
 the
 various
 ways
 that


the
 adventure
 of
 leaving
 our
 home
 could


actually
 be
 a
 misadventure.
 I
 got
 to
 do


my
 hair.
 Maybe
 I
 have
 to
 do
 my
 makeup.
 I


have
 to
 find
 the
 new
 jeans
 that
 I
 want


to
 wear.
 I
 have
 to
 travel
 to
 meet
 them.


I
 might
 not
 be
 able
 to
 park.
 The
 subway


might
 be
 delayed.
 It
 might
 be
 a
 boring


conversation
 with
 them.
 I'm
 not
 so
 sure


that
 I
 have
 the
 emotional
 energy
 to
 be


there
 for
 my
 friend
 right
 now."


And
 so
 all
 we
 think
 of
 is
 the


misadventure
 rather
 than
 the
 adventure


of
 socializing.
 And
 so
 we
 say
 no
 and


instead
 we
 just
 go
 back
 to
 our
 phones.


We
 are
 essentially
 dumping
 our
 dopamine,


our
 drive
 into
 our
 screens
 rather
 than


gifting
 it
 to
 other
 people.
 We're


reserving
 our
 energy
 for
 glass
 rather


than
 actual
 friendship.
