Pixar
 has
 dominated
 the
 world
 of


animation
 with
 titles
 like
 Toy
 Story


Finding
 Nemo
 The
 Incredibles
 cars


Monsters
 zc
 the
 firm
 has
 won
 27
 Academy


Awards
 and
 today
 we
 are
 in
 the
 very
 very


good
 company
 with
 Ed
 catull
 who
 started


it
 with
 Steve
 Jobs
 and
 John
 ler
 now
 Ed


also
 wrote
 the
 best
 book
 I
 have
 ever


read
 about
 creativity
 namely
 creativity.


in
 if
 you
 haven't
 read
 it
 you
 should
 run


out
 and
 buy
 it
 so
 at
 what
 an
 honor
 to


have
 you
 on
 the
 podcast
 it's
 my
 pleasure


to
 be
 here
 um
 Ed
 when
 you
 started
 Pixar


what
 was
 your
 vision
 for
 the
 firm
 well


initially
 the
 vision
 was
 just
 to
 make


the
 first
 animated
 film
 and
 uh
 in
 the


process
 of
 doing
 that
 I
 and
 we


transferred
 from
 like
 a
 technical
 Vision


to
 a
 a
 management
 and
 a
 cultural


vision
 and
 it
 took
 a
 while
 to
 figure


this
 out
 many
 years
 of
 observing
 other


companies
 making
 mistakes
 and
 learning


but
 also
 finding
 that
 managing
 for
 me


personally
 was
 extremely
 interesting
 so


I
 went
 from
 being
 a
 technical
 person
 to


a
 manager
 but
 evolved
 over
 time
 no


training
 it's
 just
 all
 learning
 as
 you


go


observing
 and
 learning
 from
 the
 mistakes


As
 You
 observe
 this
 and
 as
 you
 um
 worked


what
 kind
 of
 Cultural
 Mission
 do
 did
 you


have
 well
 I
 I
 was
 fortunate
 in
 that
 when


I
 started
 off
 in
 graduate
 school
 my


first
 two
 teachers
 later
 received
 the


touring
 award
 for
 entirely
 different


reasons
 one
 of
 them
 was
 Alan
 Kay
 who


pretty
 much
 ingrained
 me
 the
 notion
 that


things
 were
 going
 to
 change
 at
 an


exponential
 rate
 but
 the
 other
 one
 was


from
 Ivan
 Southerland
 who
 was
 basically


saying
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 what
 your
 big


vision
 is
 you
 got
 to
 solve
 the
 problem


now
 so
 these
 are
 the
 two
 sides
 of
 it
 but


one
 of
 the
 more
 important
 things
 was


that
 when
 I
 was
 at
 in
 graduate
 school
 I


loved
 the
 culture
 it
 was
 supportive


everybody
 was
 in
 This
 Together
 there
 was


no
 real
 class
 structure
 and
 when
 I
 left


I
 just
 said
 to
 myself
 this
 is
 the
 kind


of
 environment
 that
 I
 would
 like
 to
 have


for
 the
 rest
 of
 my
 life
 one
 of
 the


things
 you
 talk
 about
 in
 your
 book
 what


actually
 about
 three
 important
 points
 in


terms
 of
 getting
 Collective
 creativity


one
 is
 that
 uh
 you
 uh
 should
 put
 the
 cre


the
 creative
 Authority
 in
 the
 hand
 of
 a


project
 leader
 rather
 than
 a
 an


executive
 wh
 why
 is
 that
 important


projects
 need
 leadership
 with
 them
 but


at
 the
 same
 time
 if
 everything
 is
 topped


down
 then
 that
 means
 the
 person
 who
 is


at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 company
 is
 making
 the


decisions
 but
 the
 person
 at
 the
 top
 of


the
 company
 actually
 often
 doesn't
 know


exactly
 what
 what's
 going
 on
 so
 um
 from


my
 point
 of
 view
 it
 meant
 that
 the


people
 who
 are
 running
 and
 this
 included


Steve
 Jobs
 too
 who
 was
 our
 um
 the
 uh
 the


chairman
 of
 the
 M
 investor
 was
 that
 we


didn't
 pretend
 to
 be


filmmakers
 that
 you
 have
 filmmakers


there
 and
 they
 have
 to
 make
 the


decisions
 but
 we
 also
 know
 those


decisions
 are
 hard
 they're
 tough
 um
 you


uh
 essentially
 have
 to
 trust
 TR
 them


because
 nothing
 works
 when
 you


start
 and
 if
 you
 don't
 do
 that
 then


they're
 not
 solving
 the
 problems
 you


don't
 want
 to
 become
 their
 problem
 you


want
 them
 to
 own
 the
 problem
 of
 making


the
 film
 you
 also
 talk
 about
 uh
 the


importance
 of
 sharing
 work
 in
 progress


which
 is
 for
 many
 people
 quite
 difficult


why
 um
 tell
 us
 why
 it's
 important
 to


just
 share
 your
 work
 I
 think
 this
 true


with
 life
 in
 general
 and
 with
 with


projects
 is
 that
 if
 you're
 taking
 on


anything
 that's
 important


then
 it
 requires
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 they're


all
 participating
 in
 it
 and
 you
 have
 to


think
 of
 them
 as


co-creators
 and
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 treat


them
 like
 co-creators
 then
 they
 have
 to


be
 engaged
 in
 the


problems
 which
 means
 that
 since
 you
 know


you're
 going
 to
 have
 problems
 at
 the


beginning
 that
 I
 can't
 even
 judge


whether
 or
 not
 something
 is
 good
 because


it
 has
 problems
 the
 only
 judge
 that
 I


have
 of
 of
 had
 of
 of
 any
 project
 was


whether
 or
 not
 the
 team
 was
 functioning


well
 together
 if
 they're
 functioning


well
 if
 they're
 laughing
 and
 they're


struggling
 with
 each
 other
 then
 they
 are


much
 more
 likely
 to
 solve
 the


problems
 and
 if
 they're
 not
 getting


along
 with
 each
 other
 or
 they
 or
 the


leader
 loses
 the
 trust
 in
 the
 people


then
 they're
 not
 likely
 to
 solve
 the


problem
 so
 the
 the
 measure
 is


the
 health
 of
 the
 group
 not
 not
 whether


or
 not
 the
 Project's
 working
 because
 the


project
 is
 the


problem
 so
 they
 may
 struggle
 and
 I'm
 not


looking
 at
 the
 fact
 that
 they're


struggling
 it's
 are
 they
 going
 are
 they


working
 together
 you
 also
 uh
 talk
 about


the
 the
 importance
 of
 dismantling


natural
 barriers
 and
 and
 silos
 and
 so
 on


um
 tell
 me
 about
 that
 well
 the


natural
 uh
 tendency
 in


organizations
 is
 to
 optimize
 something


and
 make
 it
 work
 work
 group
 in
 other


words
 even
 though
 they
 don't
 like
 silos


people
 tend
 to
 make
 them
 just
 a
 natural


tendency
 in
 organizations
 um
 and
 so
 if


you
 point
 this
 out
 that
 they're
 doing


something
 that
 they
 don't
 actually


particularly


like
 then
 they're
 more
 open
 to
 sort
 of


breaking
 down
 those
 doors
 and
 what
 it


means
 is
 paying
 attention
 to
 little


details
 in
 the
 case
 of
 the
 Pixar


building
 which
 I
 believe
 is
 the
 best


building
 I've
 ever
 worked
 in
 in
 my
 life


was
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 building
 was
 an


open
 space
 where
 people
 crossed
 and
 had


to
 cross
 to
 get
 around
 the
 building
 so


it
 was
 designed
 to
 have
 all
 the
 the


community
 things
 at
 the
 center
 our


theaters
 we
 had
 three
 theaters
 to
 show


films
 in
 process
 our
 eating
 area
 our


meeting
 rooms
 our
 bathrooms
 were
 all
 at


the
 center
 so
 everybody
 had
 a
 reason
 to


cross
 um
 it's
 just
 paying
 attention
 to


those
 kinds
 of
 details


which
 caused
 inadvertent
 encounters
 to


take
 place
 what
 were
 some
 of
 the
 other


things
 that
 you
 liked
 with
 the
 building


the
 decor
 was
 uh
 clean
 but
 at
 the
 same


time
 all
 the
 walls
 like
 the
 walls
 to
 the


animators
 were
 painted
 white
 and
 the


reason
 they
 were
 painted
 white
 was
 they


were
 encouraged
 and
 allowed
 to
 do


whatever
 they
 wanted
 to
 these
 buildings


I
 me
 to
 these


rooms
 and
 they
 just
 did
 strange
 things


some
 of
 them
 cut
 holes
 in
 the
 walls
 and


Facilities
 supported
 that
 so
 nobody
 was


saying
 don't
 touch
 this
 or
 don't
 paint


this
 I
 like
 knock
 yourself
 out
 and
 they


did
 they
 did
 some
 of
 the
 strangest


things
 and
 it
 gave
 a
 an
 organic
 feel
 to


the
 building
 but
 organic
 in
 the
 sense


that
 the
 people
 working
 in
 the
 spaces


were
 the
 ones
 who
 made
 the
 changes
 there


isn't
 any
 facilities
 group
 that's
 saying


don't
 do
 that
 their
 job
 is
 do
 that


and
 the
 only
 requirement
 is
 don't
 break


fire
 code


laws
 now
 um
 you
 mentioned
 Steve
 jobes
 um


when
 you
 compare
 him
 with
 other
 CEOs


what
 sets
 him
 apart
 what
 set
 him
 apart


over
 the
 course
 of
 my
 life
 with
 him
 and


I
 worked
 for
 Steve
 longer
 than
 anybody


else
 um
 when
 I
 first
 knew
 him
 he
 was


like
 that
 kind
 of
 person
 who
 got
 kicked


out
 of
 apple
 and
 uh
 which
 was
 not
 a
 good


behavior
 so
 I
 knew
 him
 when
 he
 he
 was


there
 and
 that's
 what
 people
 write
 about


and
 make
 the
 movies
 about
 but
 Steve
 was


so
 smart
 that
 I
 watched
 him
 learn
 from


his
 mistakes
 and
 he
 went
 through
 an
 arc


in
 his
 life
 and
 probably
 in
 the
 years
 of


1991
 through


995
 he
 dramatically
 changed
 he
 got


married
 his
 son
 Reed
 was
 born
 um
 Pixar


made
 its
 first
 film
 and
 was
 successful


when
 Pixar
 went
 public
 in
 '95
 it
 was
 his


first
 success
 since
 being
 forced
 out
 of


apple
 and
 uh
 in
 the
 process
 he
 became


empathetic
 and
 after
 he
 changed
 the


people
 who
 are
 with
 Him
 stayed
 with
 him


for
 the
 rest
 of
 his
 life
 so
 that's
 sort


of
 like
 the
 arc
 part
 of
 the
 story
 but


the
 other
 one
 was
 the


sheer
 um
 Brilliance
 and
 the


understanding
 of
 change
 so
 as
 I


mentioned
 he
 didn't
 tell
 us
 how
 to
 make


the
 films
 at
 at
 Pixar
 never
 did
 nor
 did


he
 ever
 tell
 me
 how
 to
 do
 technology
 or


what
 computers
 to
 use
 what
 software
 to


use
 so
 that
 was
 my


domain
 um
 he
 was
 just
 a
 fierce
 protector


of
 what
 we
 were
 doing
 and
 we
 were
 very


different
 than
 Apple
 but
 the
 other
 thing


which
 I
 don't
 think
 people
 realized
 was


Steve
 relationship
 with
 the
 people


around
 him
 this
 is
 where
 the
 mythology


about
 Steve
 actually
 isn't
 M
 doesn't


match
 up
 with
 the
 reality
 so
 as
 an


example
 at
 Pixar
 we
 were
 a
 public


company
 for
 10


years
 during
 that
 10


years
 Steve


fired
 two
 members
 of
 the
 board
 of


directors
 and
 the
 reason
 he
 fired
 them


was
 they
 never
 disagreed
 with
 him
 and
 he


said
 if
 they
 don't
 disagree
 with
 me


they're
 not
 bringing
 any
 value
 to
 the


company
 his
 people
 favored
 the
 phone


over
 the
 iPad
 and
 they
 disagreed
 and


they
 convinced
 Steve
 they
 think
 well
 he


was
 always
 making
 the
 right


decision
 the
 right
 decision
 was
 to
 have


strong
 people
 who
 disagreed
 with
 you
 but


you
 all
 had
 a
 common
 interest
 in
 mind


how
 important
 has
 it
 been
 for
 you
 Ed
 to


have
 people
 around
 you
 who
 disagree
 with


you
 well
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 those
 things


that
 has
 been


emotionally
 um
 one
 of
 the
 most


gratifying
 things
 I
 had
 at
 Pixar
 was


when
 I
 go
 into
 a
 meeting
 then
 I
 was
 just


one
 of
 the
 people
 throwing
 out
 ideas


we'd
 have
 these
 intense
 discussions
 and


the
 reason
 it
 was
 emotionally


gratifying
 was
 even
 if
 we
 didn't
 solve


the
 problem
 and
 we
 didn't
 agree
 when
 I


walked
 out
 of
 that
 meeting
 feeling
 like


that
 all
 of
 us
 own
 the
 problem
 they


weren't
 looking
 at
 me
 and
 saying
 what


should
 we
 do
 you're
 the
 leader
 make
 the


decision
 it's
 like
 we're
 all
 in
 this


together
 I
 mean
 we
 were
 together
 for


years
 and
 years
 and
 years
 because
 in


fact
 we
 felt
 like
 a
 like
 a
 say
 like
 a


squabbling
 family
 but
 a
 family
 was


holding
 together
 on
 you
 know
 solving


difficult
 problems
 what's
 the
 key
 to


creating
 that
 kind
 of
 family
 and
 that


kind
 of
 atmosphere
 where
 people
 can


disagree
 in
 a
 constructive
 manner
 well
 I


I
 think
 part
 of
 it
 is
 is
 genuinely


appreciating
 the
 contributions
 of
 others


and
 setting
 up
 an
 environment


where
 they're
 all
 that
 way
 too
 that
 is


they
 want
 to
 hear
 what
 the
 others
 have


to
 say
 so
 when
 we
 set
 up
 our
 Brain
 Trust


which
 people
 find
 kind
 of
 interesting


but
 there
 are
 a
 few
 keys
 to
 the
 Brain


Trust
 one
 of
 them
 is
 the
 the
 Brain
 Trust


actually
 doesn't
 have
 any
 Authority


explain
 what
 the
 Brain
 Trust
 is
 we


understood
 at
 the
 beginning
 that
 you
 get


lost
 in
 your
 own
 project
 you
 lose


objectivity
 so
 it's
 very
 important
 to


have
 an
 outside


force
 who
 is
 understands
 the
 business
 or


the


project
 and
 will
 question
 what
 you're


doing
 um
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 they
 have


a
 vested
 interest
 in
 your
 succeeding
 so


we
 started
 with
 our
 first
 few
 films


there
 was
 a
 person
 down
 at
 Disney's
 Tom


schum
 marker
 who
 was
 that
 outside
 force


he
 would
 just
 challenge
 what
 we
 were


doing
 we
 didn't
 often
 didn't
 agree


didn't
 matter
 he
 was
 the
 outside
 force


but
 we
 appreciated
 it
 but
 at
 some
 point


he
 was
 going
 to
 go
 he
 went
 up
 to
 the


theatrical
 in
 Disney
 back
 in
 New
 York
 we


were
 going
 to
 lose
 the
 outside


force
 so
 we
 thought
 we
 need
 to
 make
 our


own
 outside
 force
 which
 was
 this
 group


of
 the
 leaders
 who
 could
 then
 challenge


other
 people
 people's
 films
 all
 right


that
 didn't
 work
 the
 reason
 it
 didn't


work
 was
 we're
 all
 in
 the
 building


together
 we're
 not
 really


outside
 but
 what
 we
 did
 find
 in
 the


process
 of
 doing
 that
 that
 it
 was


remarkably
 effective
 at
 surfacing


problems
 so
 we
 just
 evolved
 to
 figure


out
 how
 to
 do
 this
 and
 one
 of
 the
 rules


we
 realized
 right
 away
 was
 that
 this


group
 couldn't
 override
 the
 director
 all


they
 were
 was
 giving
 uh
 feedback
 and


notes
 but
 by
 removing
 the
 power
 from
 the


room
 it
 was
 now
 about
 the
 discussion
 of


the
 project
 itself
 um
 my
 role
 there
 was


actually
 to
 look
 at
 the
 Dynamics
 of
 the


room
 my
 job
 was
 is
 this
 group
 working


well
 are
 they
 being
 honest
 with
 each


other
 and
 why
 if
 they
 aren't
 being


honest
 why
 are
 people
 afraid
 to
 say
 what


they
 think
 do
 they
 not
 want
 to
 look
 bad


in
 front
 of
 others
 are
 they
 tried
 to


impress
 each
 other
 but
 there
 are
 all


kinds
 of
 things
 that
 are
 human
 reactions


that
 can
 get
 in
 the
 way
 okay
 well
 what


are
 they
 and
 how
 do
 we
 address
 them
 and


we
 ended
 up
 with
 a
 a
 group
 that
 in


general
 was
 extremely
 effective
 focusing


on
 the
 problem
 giving
 their
 notes
 and


then
 moving
 on
 then
 the
 team
 that's
 over


the
 film
 later
 has
 to
 go
 back
 with
 those


notes
 and
 think
 about
 what
 they
 mean


and
 and
 figure
 how
 to
 address
 the


problems
 but
 they
 don't
 have
 to
 take
 the


solutions
 that
 were
 offered
 you
 never


call
 anything
 a
 failure
 you
 just
 say


that
 it
 it
 doesn't
 work
 how
 come
 well


one
 thing
 to
 not
 is
 the
 word
 failure
 is


really


loaded
 because
 it's
 got
 two
 meanings
 one


of
 them
 is
 that
 you
 screwed
 up
 you


didn't
 work
 hard
 you
 know
 can
 and
 in


business
 and
 in
 government
 failure
 is


used
 as
 a


bludgeon
 with
 which
 to
 beat


opponents
 so
 um
 there
 there's
 actually


really
 negative
 consequences
 that
 can


come
 with
 failure
 itself
 but
 there's


another
 meaning
 of
 failure
 which
 is
 that


we
 all
 fail
 we
 all
 learn
 from
 it
 but


it's
 almost
 impossible
 for
 people
 to
 uh


separate
 these
 two
 meanings
 of
 failure


but
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 learning
 part
 of


it
 which
 is
 what
 we're
 really
 trying
 to


focus
 on
 here
 what
 it
 really
 means
 is


you
 tried
 something
 and
 it
 doesn't
 work


and
 if
 that's
 your
 mindset
 then
 you're


just
 saying
 okay
 let's
 try


this
 that
 didn't
 work
 that
 calling
 a


failure
 doesn't
 help
 the
 other
 thing
 is


that
 once
 in
 a
 while
 we
 do
 have
 failures


like
 something
 is
 really
 got
 screwed
 up


but
 you
 reserve
 the
 word
 failure
 for
 a


real
 failure
 not
 for
 the
 fact
 that


you're
 just
 everybody's
 trying
 to
 do


their
 best
 to
 solve
 the
 problem
 and
 they


don't
 need
 somebody
 they're
 going
 to
 get


bludgeoned
 with
 it
 and
 they
 actually


need
 the
 confidence
 that
 let's
 try
 this


and
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 get
 damaged
 by
 it


but
 if
 you
 do
 have
 if
 you
 do
 have
 a


proper
 failure
 how
 did
 you
 how
 did
 you


deal
 with
 it
 well
 a
 a
 proper
 failure


would
 be
 as
 an
 example
 where
 after


trying
 and
 trying
 to
 fix
 something
 like


we've
 got
 let's
 say
 a
 leadership
 problem


on
 a
 film
 all
 right
 so
 people
 are
 having


problem
 with
 a
 direct
 director
 and
 they


don't
 feel
 the
 director
 is
 listening
 or


responding
 and
 in
 other
 words
 we
 do


everything
 we
 can
 to
 protect
 the
 team


but
 if
 the
 team
 loses
 confidence
 in
 the


leader
 then
 that's
 a
 problem
 so
 then
 we


try
 to
 shore
 them
 up
 we
 will
 add
 people


to
 the
 team
 or
 make
 some
 changes
 but
 in


the
 end
 if
 it
 can't
 work
 then
 we
 will


replace
 and
 have
 replaced
 the
 director


on
 the
 film
 The
 the
 truth
 is
 when
 you


put
 somebody
 in
 the
 role
 and
 you
 think


they
 can
 do
 it
 you
 are
 always
 taking
 a


risk
 but
 you
 need
 to
 do
 that
 you
 need


fresh
 voices
 you
 need
 new


viewpoints
 but
 you're
 also
 giving
 them
 a


role
 they've
 never
 had
 before
 some
 rise


to
 it
 some
 don't
 honestly
 I
 can't
 tell


ahead
 of
 time
 which
 means
 every
 once
 in


a
 while
 you
 got
 to
 go
 in
 and
 and
 and


figure
 out
 or
 or
 put
 a
 new
 leader
 in


your
 book
 you
 talk
 about
 periods
 where


you
 you
 guys
 were
 just
 working
 insanely


hard
 and
 for
 instance
 uh
 for
 Toy
 Story
 2


you
 you
 finished
 that
 in
 record
 time


what's
 the
 kind
 of
 key
 to
 managing


people
 during
 those
 super
 stressful


times
 well
 the
 key
 is
 that
 everybody


really
 wants
 this
 to
 work
 they
 have
 a


vested
 interest
 in
 the
 company
 and
 for


me
 it
 was
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important


things
 is
 that
 it
 wasn't
 like
 we
 as
 the


the
 leaders
 are
 saying
 this
 is
 the


insane
 goal
 it's
 like
 we've
 got
 an


insane
 problem
 we
 have
 to
 solve
 and
 we


all
 need
 to
 get
 together
 to
 solve
 this


problem
 so
 they
 come
 in
 with
 a
 a
 mindset


and
 part
 of
 the
 insane
 work
 was
 that


they
 were
 working
 hard
 to
 solve
 the


problem
 in
 fact
 after
 that
 one
 that
 one


was
 pretty
 insane
 actually
 it
 was
 too


insane
 um
 because
 it
 was
 just
 physically


hard
 on
 people
 but
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


films
 after
 that
 where
 we
 had
 to
 put
 of


restrictions
 in
 place
 because
 people


would
 overwork
 because
 they
 were
 trying


to
 impress
 or
 they're
 trying
 to
 do
 more


than
 was
 necessary
 for
 the
 film
 that


wasn't
 good
 for
 them
 or
 good
 for
 the


film
 so
 that's
 a
 it
 was
 a
 tricky
 balance


but
 I
 like
 the
 fact
 they
 really
 wanted


to
 do
 great
 work
 but
 we
 were
 in
 this
 for


the
 Long
 Haul
 so
 there's
 another
 side
 to


this
 which
 is
 people
 overworking
 when


they
 shouldn't
 be
 overworking
 anded
 you


have
 uh
 created
 some
 of
 the
 most


memorable
 characters
 uh
 in
 the
 history


of
 of
 film
 making
 um
 well
 first
 of
 all


what's
 the
 what
 is
 your
 favorite


character
 well
 I
 I
 would
 it's
 not
 so


much
 a
 character
 the
 first
 thing
 to
 note


is
 that
 because
 I
 was
 there
 during
 the


making
 the
 films
 I
 don't
 see
 them
 in
 the


same
 way
 that
 other
 people
 do
 I
 can't


I'm
 not
 the
 objective
 Outsider
 um
 so


every
 one
 of
 these
 films
 has
 a
 story


behind
 it
 there
 are
 probably
 like
 four


or
 five


films
 which
 uh
 rise
 to
 the
 top
 for
 me


not
 only
 is
 films
 but
 also
 the
 story


behind
 them
 so
 one
 of
 course
 is


Ratatouille
 uh
 which
 is
 such
 an
 an


unlikely
 story
 uh
 it's
 also
 one
 where


the
 original
 director
 who's
 a
 lovely
 man


he's
 the
 one
 that
 conceived
 the
 idea
 he


designed
 the
 characters
 he
 designed
 the


set
 but
 he
 was
 stuck
 and
 we
 had
 to


replace
 him
 and
 um
 we
 replaced
 him
 with


Brad
 Bird
 who
 basically
 was
 a
 is
 a


brilliant
 writer
 and
 he
 solved
 the


problem
 of
 of
 the
 movie
 so
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 final
 movie
 it's
 the
 realization


of
 the
 original
 pitch
 which
 came
 from


somebody
 else
 but
 it
 would
 not
 have
 been


that
 great
 movie
 without
 this


Insight
 that
 Brad
 had
 and
 his
 incredible


sense
 of
 dialogue
 and
 then
 it
 it
 took
 it


to
 an
 utterly
 different
 level
 what
 is


the
 key
 to
 good
 storytelling
 well
 um
 the


storytelling
 in
 in
 general
 if
 you
 think


about
 it
 like
 if
 you
 read
 a
 book
 to
 a


child
 what's
 the
 important
 part
 is


you're
 holding
 the
 child
 in
 your
 lap
 and


you're
 reading
 to


them
 um
 it's
 it's
 a
 personal


connection
 and
 uh
 we
 we
 see
 stories


throughout
 our
 life
 some
 are
 well


written
 some
 are
 just
 you
 know
 locked


off
 filling
 a
 requirement
 when
 you're


doing
 podcasts
 you're
 essentially


telling
 and
 hearing
 stories
 and
 stories


are
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 things
 we


have
 to
 communicate
 with
 each
 other
 so


if
 we're
 telling
 a


story
 uh
 or
 books
 or
 movies
 or
 Broadway


plays
 is
 we
 really
 want
 to
 communicate


with
 people
 now
 I
 know
 some
 stories
 are


just
 to
 inform
 some
 are
 to


entertain
 but
 the
 best
 movies
 are
 the


ones
 which
 connect
 to
 people
 that
 you


walk
 out
 you
 will
 had
 a
 good
 experience


but
 you
 also
 walk
 walk
 away
 with


something
 that
 you've
 connected
 with


what's
 the
 key
 to
 create
 that
 connection


well
 I
 believe
 that
 um
 it's
 you
 know
 a
 a


couple
 of
 people
 who
 are
 leading
 this


like
 the
 director
 and
 the
 writer
 who


have
 got
 a
 concept
 that
 they
 want
 but


the
 the
 reason
 you
 have
 other
 people


involved
 in
 it
 is
 you
 want
 to
 have
 the


experiences
 from
 other
 people
 you
 want


other
 people
 around
 there
 telling


stories
 from
 their
 own
 lives
 or
 their


own
 experiences
 or
 things
 they
 see
 and


there's
 a
 richness
 with
 Gathering
 each


of
 these
 and
 then
 figuring
 out
 okay
 what


is
 it
 that's
 going
 to
 make
 this
 unique


but
 good
 storytelling
 also
 and
 good


movie
 making
 requires
 that
 it
 also
 be


engaging


so
 one
 does
 have
 to
 pay
 attention
 to
 the


entertainment
 and
 since
 we
 have
 family


films
 there's
 got
 to
 be
 some
 humor


involved
 with
 it
 that
 holds
 people
 long


because
 you
 want
 to
 have
 uh
 all
 ages


you're
 combining
 the
 adventure
 the
 humor


uh
 the
 looks
 the
 appearance
 the


lightings
 the


lighting
 um
 all
 of
 these
 elements
 which


are
 part
 of
 good
 movie
 making
 something


which
 conveys
 you
 know


you
 a
 few
 ideas
 into
 an
 hour
 and
 a
 half


and
 when
 you
 develop
 characters
 what
 is


the
 key
 to
 developing
 memorable


characters
 well
 we
 have
 character


designers
 uh
 who
 are
 trying
 to
 make
 the


characters
 appealing
 even
 the
 villains


are
 meant
 to
 be
 appealing
 just
 at
 a
 at
 a


visual
 sense
 so
 that's
 one
 level
 of
 the


character
 and
 the
 other
 is
 how
 they're


animated
 you
 look
 at
 the
 at
 the


animation
 and
 and
 say
 well
 they're
 just


moving
 around
 but
 the
 animators
 have
 got


incredible
 senses
 of
 vision
 that
 is


they're
 seeing
 things
 that
 most
 of
 us


don't


see
 uh
 at
 a
 conscious
 level
 like
 where


our
 eyes
 look
 uh
 the
 Twitches
 on
 our


face
 our
 body


language
 uh
 is
 something
 that
 we
 do
 see


even
 if
 we're
 not
 aware
 of
 it


consciously
 aware
 of
 it
 we're
 still


subconsciously
 reading
 what's
 going
 on


with


body
 language
 and
 a
 good
 animator
 does


see
 that
 and
 puts
 that
 into
 the


character
 I
 give
 an
 example
 this
 back


from
 Toy
 Story
 two
 where
 um
 the
 girl


Jesse
 is
 talking
 about
 her
 life
 but


she's
 taking
 the
 braid
 and
 she's


twisting
 it
 almost
 nobody
 consciously


remembers
 that
 she
 was
 twisting
 her
 hair


but
 when
 you
 see
 that
 you
 know
 know
 that


that's
 a
 sign
 of
 her
 anxiety
 that's
 what


what
 what
 animators
 do
 is
 to
 see
 things


that
 are
 catches
 at
 a
 different
 level
 so


at
 a
 movie
 you've
 got
 like
 three


different
 levels
 of
 communicating
 you've


got
 the
 body


language
 you've
 got
 uh
 the
 actual
 uh


animation
 itself
 you
 know
 the
 motion
 and


then
 you
 got
 the
 words
 that
 they
 say
 and


what
 it's
 interesting
 when
 those


different
 levels
 are
 actually
 at
 odds


with
 each
 other
 if
 you
 say
 that
 you're


happy
 but
 you're
 doing
 physical
 actions


with
 your
 body
 which
 says
 you're
 nervous


or
 you're
 afraid
 then
 your
 brain
 picks


up
 and
 say
 okay
 now
 it's
 interesting


because
 what
 they're
 saying
 doesn't


match
 what
 they're
 doing
 but
 that's
 true


in
 life
 it's
 like
 let
 reading
 body


languages
 is
 like
 okay
 I
 can
 tell
 that


what
 they're
 saying
 is
 not
 what
 they


really
 mean


why
 what's
 the
 best
 way
 to
 um
 develop


talent
 in
 a
 creative
 organization
 we


published
 everything
 we
 did
 we
 had
 some


competitors
 who
 didn't
 because
 they


thought
 they
 wanted
 secrets
 and
 our
 view


was
 we
 want
 to
 participate
 in
 the


community
 and
 it
 wasn't


because
 we
 were
 you
 know
 religious


Believers
 in
 open


source
 it
 was
 because
 it's
 all
 a
 talent


play


if
 you


participate
 and
 you
 are
 the
 place
 that


people
 want
 to
 go
 to
 then
 you
 bring
 in


the
 best
 talent
 so
 we
 went
 to
 Lucas
 film


and
 it
 was
 the
 same
 thing
 George


completely
 supported
 the
 fact
 that
 we


wanted
 to
 publish
 everything
 and
 we


brought
 in
 even
 more
 great


talent
 and
 then
 Steve
 Jobs
 came
 in
 Steve


is
 known
 for
 being


secretive
 but
 he
 never
 questioned
 my


decision
 to
 publish
 everything
 because


he
 understood
 that
 everything
 we
 did
 was


about
 bringing
 good
 talent
 well
 then
 we


reached
 the
 point
 where
 we
 brought
 in


John
 and
 John
 understood
 that
 this
 was


all
 about
 getting
 Talent
 so
 his
 first


two
 hires
 were
 Pete
 doctor
 and
 Andrew


Stanton
 who
 were
 incredibly
 talented
 so


essentially
 you've
 got
 two
 groups
 Who


start
 off
 with
 the
 notion
 of
 this
 all


about
 getting
 good
 talents
 we
 need
 to


bring
 in
 extraordinarily
 good
 people
 now


when
 you're
 doing
 good
 work
 then
 you're


more
 likely
 to
 attract
 good
 people
 but


it
 means
 you
 have
 to
 be
 open
 to
 bringing


in
 new
 people
 I
 just
 love
 how
 uh
 you


used
 openness
 and
 transparency
 to


attract
 talent
 and
 and
 how
 that
 is
 more


important
 than
 keeping
 secrets
 you
 know


I'm
 I'm
 just
 a
 really
 believer
 in
 the


same
 thing
 you
 you
 you
 say
 sometimes
 say


smart
 people
 are
 more
 important
 than
 Gad


dares
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 that
 I
 mean


the
 first
 thing
 is
 just
 to
 to


acknowledge


my
 own
 limits
 I
 learned
 early
 on
 about


half
 of
 my
 decisions
 were
 a
 Croc
 half


were


good
 and
 I
 don't
 actually
 have
 a
 way
 of


measuring
 that
 but
 I
 think
 it's


important
 to
 understand
 that
 we
 are


wrong
 more
 than
 we
 think
 we
 are
 and
 okay


if
 you're
 wrong
 a
 lot
 then
 how
 do
 you


get
 to
 good
 place
 well
 you
 bring
 in


people
 who
 know
 things
 that
 you
 don't


know
 which
 means
 if
 you're
 picking


people
 and
 you
 can't
 even
 judge
 whether


or
 not
 they
 bring
 value
 see
 you're


you're
 measuring
 their
 ethics
 their
 work


but
 um
 you're
 also
 taking
 a
 risk
 but
 the


success
 rate
 if
 you
 approach
 it
 this
 way


is
 actually
 really
 high
 so
 the
 number
 of


people
 who
 rise
 the
 occasion
 uh
 I've


always
 found
 is
 very
 good
 these
 have
 to


be
 trusted
 most
 of
 them
 really
 want
 to


succeed
 they
 don't
 all
 succeed
 but
 most


do
 so
 um
 if
 they're
 smart
 and
 I'm


referring
 to
 that
 in
 a
 fairly
 General


sense
 like
 they're
 just
 really
 talented


and
 you're
 looking
 for
 the
 potential
 and


you
 hire
 based
 upon
 potential
 not
 upon


whether
 or
 not
 they
 reached
 a
 certain


level
 think
 you
 know
 level
 thinking
 is


they've
 crossed
 the
 bar
 they
 can
 do
 the


job
 no
 it
 it's
 what
 is
 the
 potential


because
 the
 potential
 is
 good
 actually


they'll
 catch
 up
 to
 what
 they
 need
 for


the
 job
 very
 quickly
 how
 do
 you
 screen


for
 potential
 in
 the
 case
 of
 of
 Pixar


for
 instance
 the
 bugs
 life
 our
 second


film
 the
 leaders
 of
 the
 film
 hired


people
 who
 could
 do
 the
 job
 we
 had
 more


hiring
 failures
 from
 that
 film
 than
 any


other
 because
 that
 that
 was
 their


Criterion
 could
 they
 do
 the
 job
 so
 I
 I


talk
 with
 them
 a
 lot
 about
 it
 is
 know


you
 hire
 for
 potential
 now
 the
 question


is
 how
 do
 you
 hire
 for
 potential
 so
 I


said
 well
 let's
 put
 together
 an
 intern


program
 so
 they
 took
 eight
 interns
 the


first
 year
 and
 they
 were
 amazing
 seven


of
 those
 eight
 after
 they
 graduated
 came


back
 and
 joined
 us
 they're
 they're
 still


there
 and
 they're
 they're


phenomenal
 um
 but
 they
 worked
 they
 did


real
 work
 they
 weren't
 trainees
 in
 the


sense
 they're
 watching
 as
 they
 came
 and


so
 well
 let's
 give
 them
 real
 projects
 so


they
 went
 back
 to
 school
 and
 said
 I
 get


to
 work
 on
 a
 movie
 so
 the
 next
 year
 more


people
 applied
 and
 you
 know
 I
 lost
 time


I
 checked
 there
 were
 like
 10,000


applications
 for
 most
 100
 positions
 so


right
 to
 begin
 with
 you're
 hiring
 people


who
 come
 in
 as
 a
 result
 of
 other
 people


having
 been
 given
 real
 work
 and
 having


had
 a
 good
 experience
 so
 now
 you
 can


select
 from
 pretty
 good
 people
 and
 then


you
 You
 observe
 them
 and
 then
 you
 see


whether
 or
 not
 they
 work
 so
 the
 first


filtering
 process
 actually
 is
 is
 pretty


easy
 because
 we
 got
 off
 I
 think
 to
 a


good
 start
 on
 that
 it's
 why
 I
 love
 uh


you
 know
 graduate
 and
 summer
 intern


programs
 because
 you
 just
 you
 just
 see


people
 who
 got
 tremendous
 uh


possibilities
 and
 you
 know
 uh
 abilities


and
 they
 just
 deliver
 things
 that
 you


never
 thought
 was
 possible
 I
 mean
 you're


right
 that's
 it's
 um
 I
 don't
 know
 why


people
 resist
 resistant
 to
 it
 but
 it's


an
 awesome
 way
 to
 look
 at
 people
 and


find
 people
 inredible
 and
 as
 you
 and
 as


you
 point
 out
 they
 just
 bring
 something


new
 and
 fresh
 to
 any
 organization
 anded


you
 are
 the
 the
 most
 humble
 person
 we


ever
 had
 on
 this
 podcast
 have
 you
 always


been
 this
 humble
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know


the
 answer
 to
 that
 actually
 I
 was
 easily


intimidated
 but
 even
 though
 I
 was


intimidated
 by
 people
 in
 authority
 and


EMP
 power
 it
 never
 affected
 whether
 or


not
 I
 thought
 something
 was
 right
 or


wrong
 um
 do
 you
 need
 to
 be
 humble
 to
 be


successful
 in
 Creative
 Industries
 I


think
 it's
 very
 important
 to
 understand


and
 I
 think
 I
 did
 understand
 to
 begin


with
 is
 that
 uh
 I
 really
 am
 wrong
 a
 lot


of
 the
 time
 and
 I
 think
 if
 you
 sort
 of


understand
 that
 you're
 wrong
 More
 Than


You
 Think
 You
 Are
 and
 that
 you
 need


other


people
 um
 that
 you're
 in
 a
 better
 place


and
 if
 you're


successful
 um
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 it's


because
 you
 made
 all
 these
 right


decisions
 it's
 because
 there
 are
 a
 lot


of
 people
 who
 were
 there
 making
 this


work
 you
 know
 I
 frankly
 I
 have
 seen


people
 who
 think
 that
 it
 was
 them
 who


did
 it
 and
 it's
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


negative
 it's
 a
 poison
 in
 the
 body
 to


think
 that
 your
 success
 is
 because
 you


did
 it
 yourself
 well
 that's
 a
 very


profound
 um
 observation
 how
 do
 you
 think


uh
 AI
 will
 change
 animation
 the
 one


thing
 that
 that's
 happened
 over
 the


course
 of
 my


life
 is
 that
 while
 Moore's
 law
 has
 been


a
 great
 key


indicator
 the
 the
 the
 more
 important


number
 is
 the
 the
 compound
 annual


Improvement
 of
 performance
 per


price
 so
 for
 60
 years
 years
 the
 annual


compound
 rate
 has
 been
 40%
 per
 year
 all


right
 that's
 mindblowing
 all
 right
 and


that's
 continuing
 even
 though
 Mor's
 law


has
 essentially
 tailed


off
 um
 and
 the
 actual
 rate
 is
 increased


because
 with
 the
 use
 of
 of


gpus
 and
 so
 forth
 the
 amount
 of


computing
 is


incredible
 now
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 last


10
 years
 the
 aggregate
 Computing
 in
 the


world
 has
 increased
 increas
 by
 a
 factor


of
 1
 million
 in
 10
 years
 and
 in
 the
 next


10
 years
 it's
 going
 to
 increase
 by
 1


million
 the
 the
 amount
 of
 computing


available
 in
 a
 either
 your
 portable


device
 or
 your
 desktop
 will
 increase
 by


a
 factor
 of
 40
 to
 100
 in
 the
 next
 10


years
 so
 when
 you
 look
 at
 that
 rate


which
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 we've
 lived


through
 you
 know
 for
 me
 it's
 been
 the


the
 last
 50


years
 is
 it's
 going
 to
 change
 things


dramatically
 for
 for
 good
 or
 for
 bad
 so


the
 answer
 is
 will
 it


affect
 uh
 animation
 absolutely
 it's
 also


highly
 unpredictable
 so
 that's
 that's


also
 been
 the
 course
 all
 along
 is
 that


is
 it
 going
 to
 change
 things
 absolutely


when
 the
 internet
 came


along
 uh
 you
 could
 see
 was
 going
 to


change
 everything
 was
 going
 to


democratize
 information
 it
 also


democratized
 disinformation


we
 are
 going
 to
 go
 through
 dramatic


changes
 without
 a
 doubt
 it's
 just
 that


it's
 pretty


unpredictable
 and
 I
 think
 that
 with


something
 like
 this
 our
 values
 matter


how
 we
 treat
 people
 matter
 and
 those


other
 things
 which
 just
 what
 which


aren't
 just
 about
 the
 technology
 but


they're
 about
 our
 humanity
 and
 the
 way


we
 work
 with
 people
 are
 going
 to
 be
 uh


crucial
 as
 they've
 always
 been
 some


people
 are
 good
 at
 it
 and
 some
 don't


care
 talking
 about
 um
 humanity
 and


focusing
 in
 on
 other
 things
 you
 go
 on
 um


silent
 Retreats
 from
 time
 to
 time
 what


are
 they
 about
 well
 um
 I
 was
 on
 one
 last


week
 when
 I
 did
 this
 it
 was
 kind
 of


scary
 because
 the
 that
 part
 of
 the
 brain


which
 is
 always
 chattering
 and


talking
 uh
 I
 always
 thought
 was
 me
 and


it
 was
 it
 was
 actually
 in
 in
 slowing


that
 down
 or
 stopping
 it
 to
 realize
 it


isn't
 true
 it's
 it's
 a
 tool
 I
 have
 but


um
 when
 I
 slow
 that
 down
 I
 it's
 a
 a


calmer
 place
 to
 be
 so
 I've
 done
 two
 of


them
 that
 have
 lasted
 for
 a
 month
 and


some
 people
 do
 it
 for
 a
 very
 long
 period


of
 time
 and
 uh
 it's
 a
 hard
 to
 describ


State
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 afraid
 of
 the


concept
 of
 being


quiet
 and
 so
 part
 of
 it
 is
 to
 realize
 oh


there's
 nothing
 to
 be
 afraid


of
 what
 do
 you
 feel
 like
 when
 you
 come


out
 of
 a
 month
 of
 Silence
 he
 s
 it's
 a
 a


calm
 that's
 I
 I
 typically
 have
 things
 I


need
 to
 return
 to
 do
 but
 I
 can
 go
 out
 it


with
 more
 equinity
 we
 have
 um
 a
 lot
 of


um
 young
 people
 on
 this
 listening
 to


this
 podcast
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to


young
 people
 you
 have
 78
 years
 of


experience
 if
 you
 were
 to
 synthesize


this
 down
 to
 a
 few
 pieces
 of
 advice
 for


young
 people
 the
 one
 thing
 I've
 paid


attention
 to
 recently
 is
 that
 some


people
 want
 to
 get
 rich
 quick
 and
 for


most
 people
 I've
 know
 who
 done
 just
 it


wasn't
 their
 goal
 it
 was
 actually
 to


have
 a
 personal
 goal
 which
 is
 one
 they


feel
 good
 about
 it
 has
 nothing
 to
 do


with
 wealth
 or
 anything
 like
 that
 it's


like
 I
 want
 to
 make
 a
 contribution
 to


the
 world
 and
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 who
 are
 that


way
 they
 want
 to
 address
 some
 of
 the


serious
 problems
 of
 the
 world
 today
 and


um
 we
 know
 that
 we've
 got
 very
 serious


like
 extremely
 serious
 environmental


problems
 that
 are
 coming
 we've
 got


unknown
 consequences


of
 our
 newer
 Technologies
 with
 AI
 we
 can


see
 the
 upside
 for
 them
 which
 is
 is


going
 to
 happen
 we
 don't
 fully
 know
 the


downside
 and
 so
 what
 are
 the
 the
 the


ethics
 or
 the
 values
 that
 people
 have
 to


bring
 to
 these
 changes
 which
 are
 coming


for
 those
 who
 are
 young
 they're
 entering


into
 a
 a
 time
 of
 significant
 change
 so


it's
 an
 opportunity


but
 in
 that
 opportunity
 which
 is
 one
 of


dramatic
 change
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 you
 hold


on
 to
 some
 core
 values
 while
 you
 do
 it


to
 think
 about
 what
 are
 values
 and
 what


do
 you
 want
 to
 do
 and
 what
 do
 you
 not


want
 to


do
 and
 how
 do
 you
 keep
 from
 getting
 lost


and
 the
 other
 is
 to
 Value
 other
 people's


talent
 because
 you
 are
 entering
 into
 a


space
 where
 there
 other
 people
 who
 are


very
 talented
 but
 you
 also
 have


colleagues
 with
 you
 how
 do
 you
 establish


relations
 with
 others
 and
 it
 was
 one
 of


the
 my
 community
 that
 I
 was
 growing
 up


with
 actually
 is
 not
 the
 entertainment


Community
 it's
 the
 the
 sigraph
 community


which
 is
 the
 group
 that
 developed


computer
 Graphics
 which
 had
 such
 a


profound
 impact
 those
 are
 my
 friends
 and


they're
 friends
 because
 when
 I
 was
 young


I
 joined
 with
 other
 people
 to
 solve


other
 problems
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 we


remained
 friends
 who
 participated
 my


entire
 life
 I
 value
 that
 to
 younger


people
 because
 I
 don't
 know
 what's
 going


to
 happen
 you
 can't
 even
 repeat
 what
 I


did
 you
 can't
 repeat
 the
 past
 so
 you
 you


learn
 from
 it
 You


observe
 but
 what
 you
 take
 away
 is
 okay


how
 do
 we
 approach
 the
 coming
 changes


and
 what
 are
 the
 challenges
 that
 are


meaningful
 that
 we
 want
 to
 work
 on
 well


Ed
 we
 um
 we
 can't
 repeat
 the
 past
 and


for
 sure
 we
 cannot
 repeat
 uh
 what
 you


have
 done
 so
 um
 a
 big
 thanks
 for
 being


on
 the
 broadcast
 but
 an
 even
 bigger


thanks
 for
 creating
 all
 the
 characters


and
 fairy
 tales
 and
 for
 making
 our
 lives


so
 much
 richer
 with
 what
 you've
 done
 so


big
 thanks
 from
 all
 of
 us
 well

 you


and
 I've
 enjoyed
 talking
 with
 you


Nikolai
