Every
 day
 headlines
 scream
 that
 AI
 is


coming
 for
 your
 job.
 Another


panic-inducing
 article
 about
 mass


layoffs.
 Another
 breathless
 prediction


about
 the
 end
 of
 human
 work
 as
 we
 know


it.
 But
 here
 is
 one
 simple
 truth.
 Most


of
 these
 stories
 are
 built
 on
 noise,
 not


facts.
 Noise
 about
 the
 models.
 Noise


about
 AI
 layoffs.
 Noise
 about
 how
 AI
 can


replace
 us
 all.
 Hype,
 not
 reality.
 I'm


Daria
 and
 this
 is
 Tech
 But
 Make
 It
 Real.


the
 channel
 where
 I
 study
 structural


changes
 in
 the
 tech
 industry
 in
 the


post-pandemic
 post
 layoff
 AI
 first
 era.


And
 I'm
 starting
 a
 new
 series
 of
 videos


dedicated
 to
 AI
 hype
 versus
 reality.


This
 series
 isn't
 about
 telling
 you
 that


everything
 is
 fine.
 It's
 about
 showing


you
 what's
 actually
 happening.
 In
 each


episode,
 we'll
 follow
 the
 same
 format.


First,
 we'll
 dive
 into
 the
 hype,
 the


headlines
 that
 dominate
 your
 social


feeds
 and
 water
 cooler
 conversations.


Then
 we
 will
 expose
 the
 reality,
 what


the
 actual
 data
 is
 showing,
 stripped
 of


emotion
 and
 agenda.
 Then
 we
 will
 talk


about
 the
 human
 factor,
 the
 real


unspoken
 forces
 shaping
 the
 changes
 that


nobody
 talks
 about.
 And
 finally,
 I
 will


give
 you
 actionable
 strategies
 on
 how
 to


stay
 afloat.
 Here's
 what
 I'm
 going
 to


prove
 to
 you
 in
 the
 next
 20
 minutes.
 If


you
 work
 in
 customer
 service,
 support,


customer
 success,
 or
 any
 other
 client-f


facing
 role
 in
 tech,
 you're
 not
 about
 to


be
 replaced
 by
 AI.
 Not
 even
 close.
 But


you
 should
 be
 worried,
 just
 not
 from
 the


direction
 everybody's
 screaming
 about.


I'm
 going
 to
 show
 you
 the
 real
 data


behind
 the
 AI
 layoff
 headlines,
 exposing


what's
 actually
 happening
 at
 companies


claiming
 to
 go
 AI
 first,
 and
 give
 you


the
 strategy
 that
 will
 make
 you
 more


valuable,
 not
 less,
 as
 AI
 adoption


accelerates.
 If
 you're
 ready
 to
 stop
 the


panic
 and
 start
 preparing,
 let's
 dive


in.
 The
 hype.
 AI
 replacement
 support
 and


other
 customer
 service
 roles
 has
 been


one
 of
 the
 most
 discussed
 and


controversial
 topics
 in
 tech
 throughout


2025.
 The
 narrative
 is
 driven
 by
 major


layoffs
 at
 tech
 giants
 Amazon,


Microsoft,
 Meta,
 Intel,
 and
 others


attributed
 directly
 to
 AIdriven


efficiencies
 and
 automation
 with
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 jobs
 cut
 in
 the
 first
 half


of
 2025
 alone.
 This
 way
 of
 job
 cuts


emerges
 against
 a
 backdrop
 of
 companies


aiming
 to
 trim
 costs
 and
 leverage


AIdriven
 efficiencies
 and
 restructuring


efforts.
 These
 layoffs
 were
 not
 mere


reactions
 to
 financial
 constraints,
 but


were
 indicative
 of
 a
 broader
 trend
 in


which
 white
 collar
 positions
 long


considered
 secure
 were
 now
 vulnerable.


So
 this
 is
 a
 headline
 and
 now
 we're


going
 to
 move
 past
 the
 big
 screaming


title
 and
 read
 without
 doing
 any
 further


research.
 Just
 read
 what's
 written
 in


the
 article.
 And
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 see


is
 that
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 the
 2025
 layoffs


are
 not
 being
 attributed
 purely
 to
 AI.


Let's
 talk
 about
 the
 reality.
 We're


going
 to
 open
 Techrunch's
 comprehensive


list
 of
 2025
 layoffs
 in
 tech
 and
 go


company
 by
 company
 and
 I
 will
 prove
 to


you
 why
 AI
 replacing
 customer
 service
 is


a
 lot
 more
 of
 a
 panic
 mode
 rather
 than


the
 reality.
 Let's
 start
 with
 the
 big


ones.
 Bumble
 announced
 in
 an
 SEC
 filing


that
 it
 will
 cut
 approximately
 240
 jobs


or
 30%
 of
 its
 workforce
 to
 enhance


operational
 efficiency
 and
 allocate
 the


resulting
 savings
 to
 the
 development
 of


new
 products
 and
 technologies.
 According


to
 a
 CNBC
 report,
 the
 layoffs
 will
 help


the
 online
 dating
 app
 save
 $40
 million


annually
 per
 the
 report.
 Now,
 from
 here,


let's
 look
 at
 the
 CNBC
 report.
 Shares
 of


the
 dating
 company
 have
 plunged
 since


their
 debut
 on
 the
 public
 markets
 in


2021.
 Its
 market
 value
 has
 plummeted


from
 $7.7
 billion
 to
 about
 $673
 million


as
 of
 Wednesday's
 close.
 Now,
 do
 you
 see


anything
 here
 mentioned
 about
 automation


or
 anything
 saying
 100
 support


specialists
 were
 replaced
 by
 AI?
 No.
 But


the
 noise
 is
 telling
 you
 Bumble
 is


slashing
 30%
 of
 staff.
 AI
 is
 coming
 for


your
 job.
 But
 when
 you
 open
 the
 source,


all
 of
 a
 sudden
 the
 big
 and
 hairy
 AI


monster
 is
 not
 so
 big
 and
 hairy
 anymore.


And
 if
 you
 put
 yourself
 in
 the
 shoes
 of


the
 Bumble
 founder
 and
 you
 realize
 that


the
 company
 is
 public
 and
 your
 shares


have
 plummeted,
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 your


 together
 and
 restructure
 to
 keep


your
 company
 alive.
 So
 once
 again,
 you


hear
 layoffs,
 but
 if
 you
 look
 into
 why


the
 layoffs
 are
 happening,
 it
 actually


makes
 sense
 and
 they
 have
 nothing
 to
 do


with
 AI.
 As
 someone
 not
 interested
 in


the
 online
 dating
 and
 not
 keeping
 pulse


on
 what's
 happening
 in
 the
 online
 dating


world,
 even
 I
 know
 that
 online
 dating


trend
 is
 on
 the
 decline.
 I
 come
 across


physical
 ads
 all
 over
 the
 city
 about
 the


offline
 events
 for
 singles,
 cooking


classes,
 dance
 classes,
 drinks,
 outdoor


film
 festivals.
 So,
 no,
 I
 am
 not


surprised
 that
 the
 profits
 of
 Bumble
 are


dropping.
 And
 AI
 has
 absolutely
 nothing


to
 do
 with
 these
 layoffs.
 Moving
 on,


let's
 look
 at
 a
 bigger
 guy,
 Google.


Looking
 at
 this
 title,
 Google
 reportedly


cuts
 smart
 TV
 budget
 and
 prioritizes
 AI


and
 YouTube.
 On
 June
 23rd,
 Google


reportedly
 reduced
 its
 investment
 in
 its


smart
 TV
 division,
 specifically
 cutting


the
 budget
 for
 Google
 TV
 and
 Android
 TV


by
 10%.
 Did
 anybody
 hear
 AI
 or


automation
 layoffs?
 Let
 me
 bring
 you


back
 to
 where
 we
 started
 for
 a
 second.


We
 started
 from
 Fang
 is
 laying
 off


people
 because
 of
 AI.
 But
 when
 you
 open


the
 links,
 when
 you
 open
 the
 sources,


turns
 out
 that
 the
 layoffs
 have
 nothing


to
 do
 with
 automation.
 And
 if
 anything,


they're
 creating
 jobs
 in
 the
 different


division.
 All right,
 let's
 look
 for


different
 lengths.
 Let's
 take
 another


one.
 Microsoft.
 Microsoft
 is


contemplating
 additional
 layoffs
 that


could
 happen
 by
 May.
 Business
 Insider


reported
 the
 company
 said
 to
 be


discussing
 reducing
 the
 number
 of
 middle


managers
 and
 non-coders
 in
 a
 bit
 to


increase
 the
 ratio
 of
 programmers
 to


product
 managers.
 First
 of
 all,
 as
 a


product
 manager,
 I
 am
 happy
 that
 the
 PM


market
 is
 finally
 starting
 to
 balance


itself
 out.
 The
 amount
 of
 people
 who
 got


a
 PM
 title
 during
 pandemic
 hiring
 surge


was
 ridiculous.
 As
 someone
 who
 fought


for
 a
 PM
 job
 for
 years,
 I
 feel
 like
 my


job
 got
 really
 devalued
 more
 than
 an


Argentinian
 peso
 during
 pandemic
 when


people
 decided
 that
 PM
 job
 is
 writing


Jira
 tickets.
 Point
 is,
 this
 is
 not


automation.
 This
 is
 big
 tech
 correcting


their
 own
 overhiring
 decisions
 from
 5


years
 ago.
 Moving
 on,
 Canva.
 Canva
 is


the
 only
 real
 example
 of
 people
 being


laid
 off
 because
 their
 job
 is
 now
 being


done
 by
 AI.
 Now
 in
 Canvas
 case,
 it
 only


covers
 technical
 writers
 and
 today
 is


about
 customerf
 facing
 rules.
 So
 we're


not
 discussing
 technical
 writing
 in
 this


episode.
 I
 will
 make
 a
 separate
 episode


about
 UX.
 But
 in
 a
 nutshell,
 yes,


technical
 writers
 do
 have
 a
 legit
 reason


to
 worry.
 But
 again,
 this
 is
 not


customer
 service
 and
 not
 support.
 Okay.


Now,
 let's
 pick
 a
 company
 that
 is
 highly


dependent
 on
 customer
 service.


HelloFresh,
 a
 meal
 kit
 company,
 is


closing
 one
 of
 its
 sites
 in
 North
 Texas


and
 cutting
 over
 207
 workers.
 HelloFresh


is
 shuttering
 its
 distribution
 center


and
 consolidating
 to
 another
 site
 in


Irving
 to
 manage
 the
 volume
 in
 the


region.
 Again,
 no
 mention
 of
 automation.


Okay,
 maybe
 this
 is
 all
 a
 lie
 and
 I'm


not
 looking
 well
 enough.
 Fine,
 I
 look


better.
 I'm
 searching
 specifically
 for


AI
 related
 and
 automation
 related


layoffs.
 Looking
 at
 AI
 job
 displacement


of
 2025,
 once
 again
 focusing


specifically
 on
 customer
 service
 rules.


AI
 chatbots
 reduce
 telemarketing
 costs


by
 80%
 making
 human
 customer
 service


rapidly
 obsolete.
 When
 did
 you
 last


speak
 to
 a
 human
 when
 calling
 customer


support?
 Exactly.
 Well,
 I
 do
 remember


the
 last
 time
 I
 spoke
 to
 a
 human
 and


pretty
 much
 every
 single
 time
 I
 need
 to


get
 in
 touch
 with
 support,
 I
 do
 speak
 to


a
 human.
 Also,
 read
 this
 again.
 AI


chatbots
 reduce
 telemarketing
 costs
 by


80%.
 Yes,
 in
 theory
 they
 do.
 And
 we're


talking
 about
 very
 well-trained
 and


tuned
 chat
 bots.
 Not
 a
 word
 about


support,
 delivery
 managers
 or


implementations.
 The
 only
 example
 of


customer
 service
 being
 replaced
 by
 AI


that
 I
 found
 in
 my
 research
 and
 the
 one


that
 I
 can
 attest
 to
 is
 Amazon.
 I
 think


the
 way
 Amazon
 handles
 their
 customer


support
 queries
 is
 very
 well
 automated.


But
 even
 then,
 there
 are
 plenty
 of
 use


cases
 where
 the
 chatbot
 will
 not
 do
 the


job.
 I
 have
 personally
 called
 Amazon


support
 several
 times,
 especially
 when


it
 came
 to
 billing
 problems.
 I
 remember


once
 ordering
 a
 gift
 for
 my
 friend
 in


Germany
 and
 I
 had
 to
 make
 that
 purchase


on
 the
 German
 Amazon.
 So
 to
 order
 a


product
 off
 of
 Amazon
 in
 a
 different


country,
 I
 had
 to
 create
 a
 country


specific
 Amazon
 account.
 So
 the
 whole


international
 user
 flow
 isn't
 really


solved.
 And
 when
 I
 had
 issues
 with
 that


order,
 the
 chatbot
 wasn't
 able
 to
 help


me.
 On
 top
 of
 it,
 I
 was
 not
 able
 to


resolve
 this
 issue
 with
 Amazon
 Canada


because
 I
 had
 to
 call
 the
 German
 Amazon


to
 resolve
 the
 issue.
 And
 now
 I
 would


like
 to
 take
 a
 closer
 look
 at
 a
 very


interesting
 case
 that
 happened
 with
 a


Swedish
 company
 called
 CLA,
 which
 is
 a


major
 European
 fintech
 unicorn,
 and


study
 their
 case
 a
 little
 bit
 closer.


What
 happened
 back
 in
 2022?
 CLA
 made


headlines
 when
 it
 laid
 off
 around
 700


workers,
 which
 is
 a
 significant
 portion


of
 its
 workforce
 at
 the
 time.
 The
 CEO


was
 vocal
 about
 embracing
 AI
 tools
 that


could
 take
 over
 tasks
 such
 as
 customer


support,
 translation,
 content
 creation,


and
 even
 executive
 level


decision-making.
 Fast
 forward
 to
 2024,


and
 things
 did
 not
 go
 as
 planned.
 Clara


got
 a
 surge
 in
 customer
 complaints,
 a


major
 dip
 in
 user
 satisfaction,
 loss
 of


users,
 and
 growing
 frustration
 on
 social


media.
 And
 all
 of
 this
 was
 because
 of


the
 dominance
 of
 AI
 and
 customer


support.
 Customers
 complained
 that


automated
 responses
 were
 too
 generic,


repetitive,
 and
 simply
 unhelpful
 when


dealing
 with
 real
 life
 problems.
 Things


that
 were
 specifically
 cited,


impersonal,
 and
 repetitive
 AI


interactions,
 inaccurate
 or
 confusing


answers,
 difficulty
 resolving
 complex
 or


sensitive
 issues,
 loss
 of
 empathy
 and


human
 touch.
 Now,
 did
 Clara
 rehire
 the


roles
 that
 let
 go
 two
 years
 prior?
 Yes,


Clara
 is
 now
 actively
 rebuilding
 its


human
 support
 teams.
 So
 key
 lessons


learned
 from
 Clar's
 experience.
 AI


should
 assist,
 not
 replace
 human


interactions.
 It
 is
 great
 when
 used
 for


pre-screening
 for
 support
 agents.
 Before


a
 human
 agent
 becomes
 involved,
 Clard's


AI
 system
 performs
 a
 comprehensive


pre-screening
 test
 to
 collect
 and


synthesize
 critical
 information.
 Details


like
 the
 name,
 account
 history,


transactions,
 previous
 interactions,


preferred
 language,
 sentiment,
 and


emotional
 tone
 of
 the
 customer's


message.
 I'd
 like
 to
 add
 a
 few
 points
 to


this.
 From
 my
 personal
 work
 experience,


I
 have
 worked
 on
 an
 AI
 agent
 for


customer
 service
 teams
 that
 handles


basic
 customer
 complaints
 or
 questions.


But
 for
 anything
 that's
 worth


escalating,
 it
 acts
 as
 an
 assistant
 to


the
 support
 agent
 almost
 like
 a


real-time
 Chad
 GBT.
 The
 agent
 analyzes


customer
 question
 and
 either
 provides
 a


template
 answer
 to
 the
 support
 agent


that
 they
 can
 send
 in
 the
 meantime
 while


it's
 looking
 for
 the
 answers
 across
 the


knowledge
 base
 or
 CRM
 and
 offers
 a


support
 agent
 several
 variations
 of
 the


response
 that
 it
 was
 able
 to
 find.
 It
 is


then
 on
 the
 support
 analyst
 to
 determine


accuracy
 of
 the
 information
 and
 add


nuance
 or
 details
 they
 deem
 necessary.


As
 a
 result,
 nobody
 lost
 jobs.
 Customer


service
 folks
 improved
 the
 speed
 of


response
 by
 almost
 20%.
 This
 is


especially
 important
 for
 companies
 whose


customer
 service
 teams
 are
 offshored
 and


where
 the
 language
 of
 the
 company
 is
 not


the
 native
 language
 of
 the
 customer


service
 agent.
 Are
 there
 more
 examples


on
 top
 of
 CLA?
 Yes,
 I
 got
 to
 mention


that
 the
 examples
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


providing
 are
 not
 specific
 to
 customer


service
 roles.
 I
 was
 looking
 for


examples
 of
 pure
 CX
 rule
 replacement,


but
 please
 understand
 that
 I
 work
 with


secondary
 data
 and
 I
 got
 to
 operate
 with


what
 I
 have.
 The
 results
 are
 often


published
 for
 groups
 of
 roles,
 customer


success
 and
 support,
 project
 management


and
 account
 management.
 So,
 just
 keep


that
 in
 mind.
 IBM
 IBM
 replaced
 over


8,000
 HR
 and
 support
 staff
 with
 its


in-houseuilt
 AI
 platform,
 Ask
 HR,
 aiming


to
 automate
 94%
 of
 internal
 queries
 and


documentation.
 By
 automating
 these


processes,
 IBM
 saved
 an
 impressive
 $3.5


billion
 across
 70
 different
 roles,


providing
 significant
 efficiency
 gains.


But
 IBM
 soon
 realized
 that
 complex
 HR


issues
 such
 as
 policy
 judgment,


exceptions,
 and
 grievance
 resolutions


were
 not
 being
 solved
 by
 AI
 either


efficiently
 or
 accurately.
 Reports


surfaced
 that
 IBM
 began
 rehiring


hundreds
 of
 staff
 not
 for
 basic
 support,


but
 for
 roles
 demanding
 empathy,


discretion,
 and
 nuance
 decision-making.


As
 a
 result,
 IBM
 shifted
 to
 a
 hybrid


model,
 combining
 AI
 for
 repetitive
 tasks


with
 human
 specialists
 for
 complex


cases.
 Let's
 look
 at
 Dolingo.
 I
 would


say
 that
 Dolingo
 is
 more
 of
 a
 bad


example
 in
 terms
 of
 framing
 and


positioning
 of
 AI.
 Dualingo
 announced
 a


shift
 to
 an
 AI
 first
 strategy
 in
 April


2025,
 laying
 off
 or
 not
 renewing


contracts
 for
 a
 significant
 portion
 of


its
 support
 and
 content
 moderation


teams,
 replacing
 them
 with
 AI
 tools
 for


content
 creation
 and
 user
 support.
 The


move
 caused
 an
 intense
 backlash
 from


users
 and
 employees
 with
 concerns
 over


declining
 content
 quality
 and
 loss
 of


the
 human
 touch.
 Shortly
 after,
 they


faced
 bad
 publicity
 and
 push
 back
 from


the
 general
 public
 on
 social
 media
 after


announcing
 the
 move,
 particularly
 on
 Tik


Tok.
 The
 top
 comments
 on
 virtually
 every


recent
 post
 have
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 the


video
 or
 the
 company
 and
 everything
 to


do
 with
 the
 company's
 embrace
 of
 AI.
 As


a
 result,
 Dolingo
 wugged
 back
 on
 its
 AI


only
 approach,
 emphasizing
 a
 hybrid


model
 where
 AI
 augments
 but
 does
 not


replace
 human
 workers.
 And
 now
 after
 we


have
 realized
 the
 headlines
 versus
 what


the
 companies
 are
 actually
 doing
 and


saying,
 I
 would
 like
 to
 talk
 about
 a


very
 real
 risk
 for
 customer
 service
 and


tech
 and
 what
 AI
 is
 actually
 doing
 is


that
 it's
 exacerbating
 that
 risk
 and
 the


risk
 is
 offshoring
 and
 nearshoring.
 We


spoke
 about
 nearshoring
 trends
 at
 length


in
 multiple
 videos
 in
 the
 where
 to
 run


series.
 But
 what
 I
 would
 like
 to


highlight
 for
 all
 customer
 service
 teams


is
 that
 if
 there
 is
 anything
 you
 should


be
 worried
 about
 in
 the
 near
 future,


it's
 the
 offshoring.
 Because
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 was
 an
 obstacle
 before
 was


the
 language
 barrier.
 For
 North
 America,


the
 top
 destinations
 for
 offshoring


customer
 success
 is
 Latin
 America
 and


India.
 In
 India,
 English
 is
 commonly


spoken,
 but
 the
 time
 zone
 is
 an
 issue.


Latin
 America
 overlaps
 for
 timing,
 but


English
 is
 their
 second
 language
 and


customer
 service
 teams
 are
 very
 much


language
 dependent
 when
 it
 comes
 to


escalations,
 complaints,
 price


negotiations,
 etc.
 With
 AI,
 this
 risk


goes
 down
 significantly
 because
 even


when
 used
 for
 assistance,
 LLM
 can


translate
 and
 interpret
 the
 nuances
 and


the
 tone
 to
 a
 non-native
 speaker.
 So
 the


likelihood
 of
 offshoring
 goes
 up
 not


because
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 replace
 you
 but


because
 AI
 is
 making
 your
 job
 easier.


Now
 let's
 talk
 about
 the
 real
 advantages


of
 AI
 and
 customer
 service
 teams
 to
 keep


things
 fair.
 AI
 customer
 service
 can


provide
 numerous
 substantial
 advantages


when
 implemented
 properly.
 It
 boosts


operational
 efficiency.
 It
 can
 handle


thousands
 of
 repetitive
 tasks
 without


fatigue.
 It
 can
 also
 scale
 to
 adjust


quickly
 during
 peak
 demand,
 eliminating


long
 wait
 times
 and
 improving
 the
 speed


of
 customer
 service.
 AI
 systems
 are


operational
 around
 the
 clock.
 They


provide
 247
 service
 around
 the
 globe.


Advanced
 data
 analytics
 can
 make
 it


highly
 personalized
 and
 tailored
 to


customer
 behavior,
 purchase
 history,
 and


usage
 patterns.
 AI
 customer
 service
 can


do
 rapid
 troubleshooting
 and
 access
 vast


knowledge
 bases
 instantly
 to
 resolve
 an


issue
 quickly.
 And
 now
 let's
 talk
 about


the
 downsides.
 Implementation
 complexity


is
 a
 significant
 challenge.
 It
 requires


substantial
 adjustments
 in


organizational
 workflows
 and
 culture.


Misalignment
 can
 lead
 to
 frustration


which
 really
 undermines
 brand
 loyalty.


Now,
 if
 you
 read
 up
 on
 the
 biggest


implementation
 challenge,
 you
 will
 see


that
 the
 most
 critical
 issue
 is
 being


attributed
 to
 the
 lack
 of
 human


interaction
 and
 how
 it
 impacts
 customer


satisfaction.
 I
 will
 address
 this
 in
 the


next
 part,
 the
 human
 factor.
 But
 I


personally
 disagree
 with
 this.
 I
 don't


think
 that
 the
 lack
 of
 the
 human
 touch


is
 the
 biggest
 problem.
 I
 think
 it


really
 depends
 on
 the
 customer


demographic
 and
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 app.


The
 products
 where
 the
 demographics
 is


younger,
 so
 for
 example,
 between
 18
 and


30,
 the
 lack
 of
 human
 connection
 is
 not


the
 biggest
 disadvantage
 really.
 To
 me


personally,
 it
 isn't.
 I
 would
 love
 for


the
 chatbot
 to
 fix
 all
 my
 issues
 and
 not


having
 to
 deal
 with
 people
 and
 not


having
 to
 call
 anyone
 for
 simple
 admin


tasks
 like
 checking
 the
 status
 of
 my


support
 ticket
 or
 closing
 a
 debit
 card.


At
 the
 same
 time,
 as
 someone
 who
 is


currently
 working
 on
 a
 SAS
 product
 where


the
 demographics
 is
 40
 years
 and
 older,


I
 can
 see
 a
 very
 clear
 behavioral
 trend


to
 prefer
 a
 human
 in
 the
 support


department
 over
 a
 chatbot.
 So,
 all
 I'm


saying
 is
 that
 in
 my
 view,
 the
 trend


around
 a
 lack
 of
 human
 touch
 is


debatable.
 Technical
 errors
 and


malfunctions
 are
 an
 inherent
 risk
 in
 AI


systems.
 And
 the
 cold
 turkey
 switch
 to


AI
 can
 very
 well
 damage
 customer
 trust


and
 the
 company's
 reputation,
 especially


if
 it's
 a
 company
 that's
 been
 on
 the


market
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 offers
 a


product
 suite
 similar
 to
 competitors.


Privacy
 and
 ethical
 concerns
 from


customers
 are
 additional
 critical
 issues


given
 AI's
 extensive
 reliance
 on


personal
 data.
 The
 human
 factor.
 There


are
 several
 things
 that
 play
 in
 your


favor.
 Customer
 experience
 and
 trust


often
 suffer
 when
 companies
 go
 AI
 only


and
 companies
 start
 suffering


reputational
 risk
 even
 before
 they
 start


replacing
 jobs.
 I
 think
 that
 people
 who


work
 in
 tech,
 people
 who
 build
 AI
 apps


are
 prone
 to
 think
 that
 everyone
 around


them
 is
 well-versed
 in
 what's
 happening


in
 the
 AI
 world.
 So
 when
 a
 companies


make
 announcements
 like
 that,
 to
 someone


who
 understands
 how
 AI
 works,
 it
 looks


like
 an
 interesting
 experiment
 that


they're
 going
 to
 watch
 closely.
 to


someone
 outside
 of
 the
 tech
 bubble.
 It


sounds
 like
 this
 company
 is
 depriving


people
 of
 jobs.
 Dolingo
 is
 actually
 a


very
 good
 example.
 Dolingo
 says
 that


much
 of
 the
 feedback
 is
 coming
 from


people
 who
 don't
 understand
 what
 AI


first
 means.
 A
 lot
 of
 feedback
 we've


seen
 comes
 from
 a
 place
 of
 passion
 for


Dolingo,
 which
 we
 really
 appreciate.
 To


clarify,
 AI
 isn't
 replacing
 our
 learning


experts.
 It's
 a
 tool
 they
 use
 to
 make


Dolingo
 better.
 Everything
 we
 create


with
 AI
 is
 guided
 by
 our
 team
 and


learning
 design
 experts.
 But
 to
 people


who
 are
 already
 skeptical
 about
 AI,
 this


statement
 is
 just
 noise.
 Companies
 in


general
 remain
 excited
 about
 the


potential
 cost
 savings
 of
 AI,
 sometimes


for
 good
 reason.
 Dualingo
 stock,
 for


example,
 is
 at
 an
 all-time
 high.
 But
 as


bullish
 as
 the
 executives
 might
 be,


however,
 that
 excitement
 has
 not
 made


its
 way
 into
 the
 consumer
 space.
 Now,
 on


top
 of
 this,
 add
 corporate
 politics.
 And


this
 mostly
 applies
 to
 large
 corpse,


especially
 legacy
 corpse
 where
 corporate


politics
 plays
 probably
 a
 larger
 role


than
 the
 products
 those
 companies


produce.
 Now
 put
 yourself
 in
 the
 shoes


of
 a
 middle
 manager
 or
 they
 decide
 to


cut
 all
 ties
 with
 the
 existing
 support


staff
 and
 then
 a
 few
 months
 later
 they


get
 a
 backlash
 like
 CLA,
 IBM
 or
 Dolingo.


Can
 you
 imagine
 the
 level
 of


embarrassment
 and
 the
 threat
 of
 job
 loss


they're
 going
 to
 face?
 I
 had
 a
 chat
 with


somebody
 a
 couple
 of
 months
 ago,
 a


person
 that
 I
 don't
 know
 very
 well
 and


they
 don't
 know
 what
 I
 do
 for
 a
 living.


They
 were
 interviewing
 for
 a
 job
 and
 I


suggested
 that
 perhaps
 it
 would
 be


helpful
 for
 them
 to
 use
 an
 LLM
 of
 choice


to
 act
 as
 a
 resume
 coach.
 And
 the
 person


I
 was
 chatting
 with
 was
 probably,
 I


don't
 know,
 27,
 28
 years
 of
 age.
 And


when
 I
 suggested
 that,
 their
 response


was,
 "Oh,
 so
 you
 believe
 in
 AI?"
 Now,


they
 do
 not
 work
 in
 tech
 and
 I'm
 not


expecting
 anyone
 outside
 of
 tech
 to


really
 understand
 how
 artificial


intelligence
 works.
 But
 that


conversation
 made
 me
 realize
 that
 I
 live


in
 a
 bubble
 where
 everyone
 around
 me


knows
 how
 machine
 learning
 works
 for


example
 and
 that
 when
 you
 meet
 a
 person


outside
 of
 that
 bubble
 they
 treat
 AI
 as


a
 religion
 a
 religion
 that
 they
 can


believe
 in
 or
 not.
 Now
 on
 top
 of
 this


add
 another
 layer
 which
 is
 enterprise


SAS
 versus
 consumer
 SAS.
 If
 you're
 in


customer
 success
 at
 a
 consumer
 SAS


company
 I
 can
 honestly
 see
 why
 you
 can


be
 worried.
 Although
 like
 I
 said
 before,


what
 you
 should
 be
 worried
 about
 is
 your


role
 being
 outsourced,
 not
 replaced
 by


I.
 Even
 if
 it
 happens,
 the
 world
 of


enterprise
 SAS
 awaits
 you.
 Now,
 we
 are
 a


long
 way
 from
 support
 and
 CX
 replacement


at
 enterprise
 SAS
 companies,
 especially


legacy
 tech.
 Why?
 A
 couple
 of
 reasons.


The
 first
 one
 has
 to
 do
 with
 the
 price


of
 enterprise
 software
 contracts.
 You


know
 how
 often
 when
 you
 go
 on
 a
 website


of
 an
 app
 for
 devs,
 designers,
 PMs,


anyone
 really,
 you
 often
 see
 individual


plan
 free.
 Let's
 say
 there
 is,
 you
 know,


a
 plan
 for
 small
 teams
 for
 five
 people,


which
 is
 like
 $50
 a
 month.
 And
 then
 for


enterprise
 package,
 call
 sales.
 Now,
 as


someone
 who
 works
 in
 product,
 there
 are


a
 lot
 of
 discussions
 on
 the
 pros
 and


cons
 of
 surfacing
 enterprise
 pricing
 and


that
 it's
 time
 we
 show
 the
 pricing
 and


stop
 losing
 leads.
 But
 in
 practice,
 the


vast
 majority
 of
 enterprise
 tech
 still


wants
 to
 go
 through
 sales.
 Why?
 Why
 is


an
 enterprise
 pricing
 shown
 on
 the


websites?
 Because
 the
 costs
 vary
 and


they
 vary
 greatly
 and
 you
 can
 be
 looking


for
 the
 price
 ranging
 from
 $10,000
 to


hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 dollars.
 And
 it


is
 also
 not
 shown
 because
 no
 company
 is


going
 to
 put
 a
 $20,000
 transaction
 on
 a


credit
 card,
 at least
 for
 now,
 which
 is


why
 sales
 is
 looped
 in
 for
 all


enterprise
 contracts.
 And
 the
 future


relationship
 between
 the
 company
 and
 the


customer
 gets
 dictated
 by
 the
 price.


This
 is
 why
 there
 is
 a
 whole
 cohort
 of


CX
 folks
 whose
 titles
 start
 with


enterprise
 customer
 success
 or


enterprise
 support
 team
 or
 enterprise


account
 management.
 These
 customers
 want


that
 service.
 They
 want
 a
 dedicated
 CX


person
 even
 if
 a
 chatbot
 is
 faster


because
 this
 is
 how
 those
 contracts
 have


been
 done
 for
 decades.
 Yes,
 it
 is
 likely


that
 it
 will
 get
 less
 dependent
 on
 human


CX
 staff
 in
 the
 future,
 but
 this
 is


going
 to
 take
 time.
 And
 I
 don't
 have
 to


tell
 you
 how
 deeply
 legacy
 culture
 is


rooted
 in
 enterprise
 tech
 in
 North


America.
 Take
 for
 example
 any
 massive


tech
 enterprise.
 Levels
 over
 levels
 over


levels
 of
 sales
 CX
 and
 support.
 Now,
 the


technology
 has
 been
 good
 enough
 for
 a


long
 time
 now
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 rid
 of


half
 of
 those
 people.
 Yet,
 here
 we
 are.


Do
 not
 underestimate
 the
 weight
 of


corporate
 politics.
 And
 now
 the
 last


layer
 of
 this
 pyramid,
 company
 policy.


Again,
 this
 is
 especially
 relevant
 to


enterprise
 tech.
 Price
 negotiation
 and


price
 formation
 in
 tech
 is
 so
 convoluted


that
 if
 you
 were
 to
 map
 it
 out,
 that
 map


would
 be
 the
 size
 of
 Brazil.
 The
 price


that
 enterprises
 pay
 for
 the
 service


depend
 on
 a
 million
 factors.
 how
 long


the
 customer
 has
 been
 with
 them,
 one-off


discounts,
 promotions,
 relationship
 with


CX,
 etc.
 The
 closest
 analogy
 I
 can
 give


you
 in
 this
 case
 is
 the
 price
 of
 a
 phone


plan
 that
 you
 have
 if
 you
 are
 with
 one


of
 the
 major
 telecom
 providers.
 I'll
 use


an
 example
 from
 my
 life.
 I
 live
 in


Canada.
 In
 Canada,
 we
 love
 monopolies.


Telecom
 is
 a
 great
 example.
 We
 have


three
 or
 four
 or
 five
 big
 monopolies


that
 control
 the
 entire
 telecom
 market.


One
 of
 them
 is
 called
 Rogers.
 So
 if
 you


put
 a
 hundred
 people
 in
 a
 row
 and
 every


single
 one
 of
 them
 is
 with
 Rogers
 and


every
 single
 one
 of
 them
 has
 the
 exact


same
 plan,
 the
 same
 data,
 the
 same


number
 of
 calls
 and
 messages,
 same


everything,
 I
 am
 ready
 to
 bet
 that
 all


of
 those
 people
 would
 be
 paying


different
 price
 for
 the
 exact
 same
 plan.


Because
 how
 they
 got
 that
 plan
 has
 a


thousand
 different
 variations.
 They


could
 have
 bought
 it
 on
 Black
 Friday


sale
 plus
 they
 got
 an
 employee
 discount


because
 the
 employee
 liked
 them
 very


much.
 plus
 they
 got
 a
 new
 customer


discount
 and
 then
 they
 somehow
 paid
 $30


a
 month.
 And
 then
 you
 take
 customer
 B


who
 bought
 the
 exact
 same
 plan
 but
 it


was
 on
 the
 back
 to
 school
 sale,
 not


Black
 Friday
 and
 the
 pricing
 that
 day


was
 different.
 And
 then
 you
 take


customer
 C
 who
 paid
 the
 full
 price
 but


they
 called
 and
 renegotiate.
 This
 is


what
 I
 mean
 by
 convoluted.
 You
 can
 see


how
 this
 multiplies.
 Now
 with
 B2C


contracts,
 it's
 easier
 and
 more


straightforward
 because
 you're
 dealing


with
 one
 customer.
 With
 B2B
 contracts,


it's
 a
 maze.
 And
 in
 my
 experience,
 when


I
 saw
 customer
 success
 negotiating
 price


with
 customers,
 half
 the
 time
 they
 play


it
 by
 the
 ear.
 Now,
 imagine
 a
 scenario


where
 a
 company
 that
 handles
 all
 of


these
 negotiations
 with
 a
 B2B
 customer


through
 a
 chatbot.
 Can
 you
 imagine
 how


they're
 going
 to
 be
 training
 that
 model,


how
 they're
 going to
 be
 fine-tuning,
 and


what
 kind
 of
 work
 they'd
 have
 to
 do
 to


be
 able
 to
 trust
 a
 chatbot
 to
 do
 those


negotiations
 effectively.
 The
 biggest


problem
 here
 would
 be
 the
 trust,
 not
 the


ability
 of
 AI
 to
 do
 the
 price


negotiation.
 The
 company
 is
 not
 going
 to


trust
 a
 chatbot
 to
 do
 that
 kind
 of
 work


because
 for
 large
 tech
 companies,
 the


number
 one
 priority
 is
 revenue.
 And
 it's


a
 very
 delicate
 balance.
 But
 enterprise


tech
 is
 not
 at
 a
 point
 where
 they're


going
 to
 trust
 AI
 to
 do
 that
 kind
 of


negotiation.
 And
 there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


massive
 resistance
 from
 within
 the


company
 to
 let
 AI
 handle
 pricing.
 So,


no,
 AI
 as
 of
 now
 cannot
 eliminate


customer
 success
 fully,
 and
 we're
 still


pretty
 far
 from
 the
 moment
 when
 and
 if


that
 happens.
 Not
 because
 AI
 cannot
 do


it,
 but
 because
 there
 is
 a
 massive
 human


factor
 at
 play.
 What's
 actually
 changing


and
 how
 to
 stay
 afloat?
 Throughout
 the


entire
 video,
 I've
 been
 telling
 you
 why


you
 shouldn't
 fall
 for
 AI
 hysteria.
 Now,


does
 this
 mean
 you're
 safe?
 No.
 AI
 is
 a


risk
 to
 your
 job,
 not
 because
 it
 can
 do


it
 instead
 of
 you,
 but
 because
 it


enables
 people
 who
 couldn't
 do
 it
 before


enter
 your
 job
 pool.
 And
 offshore
 teams


cost
 less
 for
 businesses
 because
 they


simply
 live
 in
 places
 where
 life
 is


cheaper.
 And
 we
 live
 in
 the
 world
 of


capitalism,
 ladies
 and
 gentlemen.
 So,


the
 choice
 is
 obvious.


>> Your
 mission,
 should
 you
 choose
 to


accept
 it.


>> Now,
 what
 this
 means
 is
 that
 you
 have


some
 time,
 and
 that
 time
 is
 not


indefinite,
 but
 there
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of


a
 buffer.
 Here's
 what
 I
 would
 do
 if
 I


were
 in
 a
 customer
 success
 or
 support


role
 right
 now
 and
 did
 not
 want
 to


change
 careers
 but
 wanted
 to
 stay


afloat.
 Learn
 Agentic
 AI
 and
 agent


configuration.
 Agentic
 AI
 represents
 the


most
 advanced
 form
 of
 artificial


intelligence
 to
 date.
 Unlike
 traditional


chatbots
 that
 follow
 predefined
 rules,


Agentic
 AI
 operates
 autonomously.
 It


comprehends
 natural
 language.
 It


organizes
 workflows
 and
 it
 makes
 instant


decisions
 grounded
 in
 data
 that
 it


gathers
 and
 analyzes.
 If
 we
 talk
 about


your
 future,
 not
 tomorrow's
 future,
 but


let's
 say
 the
 next
 10
 years,
 yes,
 a
 good


percentage
 of
 your
 jobs
 may
 get
 replaced


by
 AI
 agents.
 So
 the
 core
 change
 in
 your


everyday
 job
 will
 be
 the
 ability
 to


manage
 agents,
 not
 clients.
 To
 have
 the


competencies
 to
 operate
 agents,
 you
 have


to
 know
 how
 they
 work.
 You
 have
 to
 know


the
 different
 types
 of
 agent
 function.


Simple
 reflex
 agents,
 model
 based


agents,
 goal-based
 agents,
 utility
 based


agents,
 learning
 agents,
 etc.
 You
 need


to
 be
 able
 to
 configure
 agent
 parameters


and
 boundaries.
 You
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to


handle
 multi-
 aent
 orchestration.
 And


for
 that,
 you
 need
 the
 skills
 on
 how
 to


design
 modular
 agentic
 workflows,
 how
 to


manage
 shared
 context
 and
 memory,
 and


how
 to
 operate
 agentic
 SAS.
 You
 have
 to


master
 prompt
 engineering
 and
 be
 very


well-versed
 in
 techniques.
 If
 you
 want


to
 stay
 afloat,
 I
 recommend
 that
 you


research
 trend
 around
 customer
 service


rules
 turning
 into
 agent
 managers.


Again,
 this
 is
 not
 going
 to
 happen


tomorrow,
 but
 if
 you
 want
 to
 stay
 afloat


long
 term
 within
 the
 realm
 of
 customer


success
 in
 tech,
 this
 is
 what
 I
 would


recommend
 looking
 at.
 Remember
 how
 in


the
 where
 to
 run
 series,
 I
 told
 you
 that


we
 are
 not
 in
 the
 AI
 layoff
 era
 yet,
 and


that
 it
 won't
 happen
 as
 drastically
 as


the
 hype
 makes
 you
 believe.
 Now,
 I'm


building
 this
 series
 to
 show
 you
 why
 it


won't
 happen
 the
 way
 it
 seems.
 But
 will


the
 jobs
 change?
 Yes.
 Will
 some
 of
 the


roles
 be
 completely
 eliminated?
 Yes.
 But


the
 elimination
 does
 not
 mean
 that
 all


of
 you
 are
 going to
 be
 axed.
 Your
 titles


may
 change.
 Your
 responsibilities
 may


change.
 Your
 skill
 set
 will
 need
 to
 be
 a


lot
 stronger.
 And
 yes,
 some
 of
 you
 may


need
 to
 re-qualify
 entirely.
 Will
 there


be
 more
 AI
 layoffs?
 Yes,
 and
 some
 of


them
 will
 be
 hysteria.
 But
 it'll
 be
 a


contained
 hysteria
 because
 introducing


AI
 into
 everyday
 workflows
 and
 making
 it


secure,
 ethical,
 and
 safe
 is
 new
 to
 the


vast
 majority
 of
 tech
 businesses.
 Many


will
 learn
 from
 the
 lessons
 of
 CLA,


Dolingo,
 and
 IBM.
 Even
 if
 you
 get
 laid


off,
 the
 world
 of
 enterprise
 tech
 is


waiting
 for
 you.
 And
 the
 world
 of
 legacy


is
 definitely
 waiting
 for
 you
 for
 the


next
 10
 years.
 But
 don't
 waste
 your


time.
 Stop
 the
 panic.
 Stop
 the
 hysteria.


Get
 control
 over
 your
 anxiety
 and
 start


upskilling
 and
 networking
 so
 you
 can


stay
 afloat
 and
 thrive.
 As
 always,
 I


hope
 this
 helps.
 I
 would
 love
 to
 hear


your
 feedback
 on
 this
 first
 episode
 in


the
 new
 series
 and
 we'll
 see
 you
 next


time.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Bye.
