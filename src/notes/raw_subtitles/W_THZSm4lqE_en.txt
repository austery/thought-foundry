>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLaws
 podcast.
 I'm
 Jill
 Weisenthal


>> and
 I'm
 Tracy
 Aloway.
 Tracy,
 here's


something
 I've
 been
 thinking
 about
 with


respect
 to
 China
 and
 all
 of
 the
 tensions


with
 China,
 which
 is
 that
 it
 feels
 very


elite,
 as
 in
 people
 in
 DC
 talk
 about
 it,


people
 in
 obviously
 in
 finance
 and


business
 talk
 about
 it.
 It
 does
 not


strike
 me
 that
 in
 the
 broad
 and
 I
 I


could
 be
 wrong,
 like
 my
 judgment
 could


be
 off,
 but
 it
 does
 not
 strike
 me
 that


in
 the
 broad
 public
 that
 there
 are
 a
 lot


of
 people
 that
 it's
 top
 of
 mind
 for
 a


lot
 of
 the
 public.
 Weirdly,
 I
 think
 it


was
 probably
 more
 top
 of
 mind
 in
 the


past,
 right?
 And
 the
 hollowing
 out
 of


America's
 manufacturing
 sector.
 I
 mean,


that
 argument
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 has
 given


rise
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 populist
 politics


that
 we
 see
 nowadays,
 right?


>> Yeah,
 that's
 true.
 Right.
 During
 the


China
 shock,
 there
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 people


aware
 that
 their
 factories
 or
 the
 towns


that
 depended
 on
 these
 factories
 were


getting
 hollowed
 out,
 etc.
 But,
 you


know,
 there's
 so
 much
 China,
 China,


China.
 It's
 not
 in
 the
 media,
 right?


It's
 not
 like
 it
 or
 sorry
 it's
 not
 in


the
 movies
 and
 I'm
 thinking
 of
 like
 Back


to
 the
 Future
 2
 was
 it
 where
 the
 main


character's
 dad
 lost
 his
 job
 and
 they


had
 this
 scene
 when
 he
 was
 getting
 laid


off
 by
 his
 Japanese
 boss
 etc.
 Oh.
 Oh,


you
 know
 what
 my
 favorite
 example
 of


this
 is?


>> Die
 Hard.
 Yeah,
 of
 course.


>> Best
 Christmas
 movie
 ever,
 but
 also
 the


Nakatomi
 Corporation,


>> right?
 This
 was
 like
 a
 whole
 thing
 in


pop
 culture.
 It's
 just
 not
 at
 all.
 Maybe


that
 has
 something
 to
 do
 with
 the
 fact


that
 studios
 still
 want
 to
 do
 they
 still


distribute.
 Are
 American
 movies
 still


getting
 wide
 distribution?
 Like
 for
 a


while
 in
 China?
 Like
 cuz
 for
 a
 while


this
 was
 like
 a
 big
 story.
 or
 are
 they


not
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 certain
 things


because


>> this
 is
 partially
 why
 we
 have
 a
 bunch
 of


superhero
 movies
 by
 the
 way
 cuz
 they're


just


>> they
 play
 in
 international
 markets


>> and
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 like
 offend


anyone
 too
 much


>> probably.


>> It
 just
 doesn't
 feel
 to
 me
 for
 that
 from


like
 a
 pop
 culture
 standpoint
 that
 the


threats
 from
 China,
 whatever
 they
 are,


are
 like
 getting
 that
 much
 play.


>> We
 need
 a
 good
 movie
 about
 China


developing
 an
 AI
 chatbot
 that
 goes
 rogue


and
 tries
 to
 take
 over
 the
 world.
 I


think
 there
 was
 an
 AI
 plot
 in
 the
 last


Mission
 Impossible
 or
 one
 of
 the
 recent


ones.
 I
 haven't
 seen
 it.
 I
 don't
 know


who
 developed
 the
 technology.
 Maybe
 it


was
 China.
 Who
 knows?


>> It
 could
 have
 been.
 But
 anyway,
 like
 you


said
 with
 Die
 Hard
 and
 there
 were


several
 others.
 I
 think
 Michael
 Kiton


had
 a
 book
 that
 talked
 about
 it.
 And


certainly
 when
 I
 was
 younger,
 when
 I
 was


like
 11
 or
 12
 and
 first
 became
 aware
 of


the
 existence
 of
 the
 world
 around
 me,


you
 know,
 I
 remember
 I
 had
 a
 teacher
 who


was
 like
 really
 scoldy
 about
 people
 who


drove
 Japanese
 cars,
 for
 example,
 and


she
 talked
 about
 how


>> anti-American.


>> Yeah.
 How
 awful
 it
 was
 that
 there
 were


people
 coming
 into
 our
 high
 school


parking
 lot
 or
 whatever
 that
 drove


Japanese
 cars,


>> destroying
 the
 fabric
 of
 America
 by


purchasing
 a
 Toyota.


>> Yeah.
 Of
 course,
 now
 you
 know,
 buy


Toyotas
 are
 made
 in
 the
 US,
 etc.
 No
 one


talks
 like
 that
 with
 respect
 to
 Japan.


But
 is
 interesting
 thinking
 about
 like


similarities
 and
 differences
 between
 our


relationship
 with
 China
 today
 and
 our


relationship
 with
 Japan
 in
 the
 80s
 late


80s
 etc.
 when
 it
 seemed
 like
 that
 was


going
 to
 be
 the
 economy
 that
 really
 sort


of
 hollowed
 out
 what
 we


>> there's
 a
 clear
 parallel
 here.
 There
 are


also
 some
 key
 differences.
 I'm
 sure


we'll
 get
 into
 all
 of
 that.


>> A
 land
 of
 contradictions,
 similarities.


Anyway,
 I'm
 very
 excited.
 We
 have
 a


guest
 I've
 wanted
 to
 talk
 to
 for
 a
 long


time.
 the
 perfect
 guest
 because
 he


recently
 wrote
 about
 this.
 We're
 going


to
 be
 speaking
 with
 John
 Gans.
 He
 is
 an


author
 and
 historian.
 He's
 publisher
 of


The
 Unpopular
 Front
 Substack,
 which
 I
 am


a
 paid
 subscriber
 to.
 I'm
 a
 big
 fan.
 And


he's
 also
 the
 author
 of
 the
 recent
 book


When
 the
 Clock
 Broke:
 Conmenspirists


and
 how
 America
 cracked
 up
 in
 the
 early


1990s.


Talk
 a
 little
 uh
 history.
 So,
 John,


thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 on
 OddLots.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me.
 I'm
 big


fan.
 It's
 very
 exciting
 for
 me.


>> Very
 nice
 of
 you
 to
 say.
 Does
 that
 seem


right
 to
 you
 that
 like
 you
 probably
 you


pay
 attention
 to
 pop
 culture
 that
 just


today
 with
 the
 China
 anxiety?
 It
 feels


like
 a
 DC
 kind
 of
 thing
 more
 than
 a


general
 public
 thing.


>> I
 think
 that's
 true.
 It
 does
 feel
 sort


of
 a
 an
 elite
 project.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


interest
 curiosity
 about
 what's
 going
 on


in
 China
 and
 what
 they
 do
 well
 both
 in


DC
 among
 policy
 makers
 and
 I
 think
 also


obviously
 in
 Silicon
 Valley.
 Yeah.


>> A
 lot
 of
 think
 tanks
 are
 studying
 China,


thinking
 about
 China.
 Um,
 a
 lot
 of


business
 people
 are
 very
 interested
 in


China.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 know.
 It's


strange
 because
 you
 would
 think
 in
 a
 in


an
 age
 that,
 you
 know,
 has
 a
 lot
 of,
 one


might
 argue,
 paranoid
 thinking
 going
 on,


it
 doesn't
 factor
 that
 much
 into
 a
 lot


of
 pop
 culture.
 I
 think
 the
 movies
 thing


might
 be
 a
 part
 of
 that.
 That
 wasn't
 the


case.


>> Just
 the
 box
 office
 exposure.
 the
 box


office
 exposure.
 But
 I
 think
 in
 the
 80s


and
 90s
 there
 was
 definitely
 more


cultural
 product
 which
 I'm
 sure
 we'll


discuss
 more
 cultural
 products
 that


brought
 this
 kind
 of
 fear,
 curiosity,


interest,
 paranoia
 to
 the
 surface.


>> All
 right.
 Well,
 why
 don't
 we
 get
 into


the
 Japan
 panic
 of
 the
 1980s
 and
 where


it
 actually
 started?
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 I


was
 reading
 the
 Substack
 that
 you
 wrote


on
 this
 particular
 topic
 and
 I
 fell
 into


a
 giant
 rabbit
 hole
 reading
 uh
 the


emerging
 Japanese
 superstate.
 Oh


>> and
 coverage
 of
 it.
 So
 I
 didn't
 know
 the


author
 of
 one
 of
 the
 first
 provocative


Japan
 is
 going
 to
 take
 over
 the
 world


type
 books
 was
 a
 guy
 called
 Herman
 Khn
 I


think
 and
 he
 is
 the
 inspiration
 for


Stanley
 Kubri's
 Doctor
 Strange
 Love.


>> I
 didn't
 know
 that.


>> Yeah.
 And
 if
 you
 read
 some
 of
 the


coverage
 of
 his
 book
 that
 came
 out
 in


the
 1970s,
 it's
 really
 funny
 because


it's
 just
 stuff
 that
 you
 would
 never
 get


away
 with
 writing
 today.
 Um,
 the
 New


York
 Times
 New
 York
 Times
 review


actually
 starts
 out
 by
 saying
 a
 bullied


Herman
 Khan
 who
 boasts
 that
 under
 all


these
 300
 lb
 of
 friendly
 fat
 there
 lies


a
 lean
 and
 senue
 intellect.
 I
 don't


think
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 could
 start
 a


book
 review
 by
 saying
 the
 author
 is


>> talking
 about
 the
 author's
 weight.
 Yeah.


No,
 that's
 true.


>> Yeah,
 Herman
 Cotton
 is
 a
 really
 strange


and
 interesting
 character.
 He
 is
 he
 is


one
 of the
 models
 for
 Doctor
 Strange


Love.
 He
 wrote
 a
 book
 called
 On


Thermonrmonuclear
 War,
 which
 is
 probably


one
 of
 the
 strangest
 books
 you'll
 ever


read.
 And
 it's
 extremely
 cheerful
 book


about
 thermonuclear
 war.
 basically
 kind


of
 saying
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 that
 bad
 and


saying
 that
 you
 know
 yeah
 and
 I
 think


this
 is
 where
 the
 term
 he
 may
 have


originated
 the
 term
 mega
 deaths
 and


saying
 you
 know
 yeah
 we'll
 get
 a
 little


messed
 up
 but
 actually
 there's
 so
 many


people
 in
 this
 country
 who
 were
 so


productive
 how
 bad
 would
 it
 really
 be


>> we'll
 have
 some
 mega
 deaths
 don't
 worry


about


>> we'll
 have
 a
 few
 mega
 deaths
 but
 I
 don't


think
 and
 he
 thought
 that
 the
 United


States
 shouldn't
 be
 so
 fearful
 about
 it


but
 there's
 another
 weird
 interpretation


of
 the
 book
 that
 this
 was
 kind
 of
 like


some
 signaling
 strategy
 that
 the
 United


States
 because
 in
 the
 book
 he
 said
 you


can't
 show
 that
 you're
 afraid
 to


actually
 pull
 the
 trigger
 cuz
 then
 the


other
 side
 will
 push
 you
 around.
 So
 in
 a


way
 the
 book
 was
 some
 kind
 of
 signaling


strategy
 in
 his
 game
 theory
 mind
 to
 be


like
 hey
 man
 we're
 not
 worried
 we
 we


we're
 writing
 books
 that
 say


thermonuclear
 war
 is
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a


deal.
 Very
 very
 bizarre
 figure
 and
 I


think
 some
 people
 consider
 him
 very


sinister
 obviously
 but
 uh
 real
 eccentric


>> but
 he
 was
 actually
 worried
 about
 Japan.


Yeah,
 I
 think
 he
 was
 worried
 about
 Japan


and
 he
 was
 a
 little
 ahead
 of
 the
 curve


actually
 because
 he
 wrote
 his
 book
 in


the
 I
 think
 it
 was
 in
 the
 late
 1960s
 and


it
 came
 out
 in
 the
 19
 early
 1970s
 and
 he


was
 describing
 Japan
 and
 its


institutions
 and
 predicted
 that
 by
 the


year
 2000
 that
 Japan
 would
 be
 the
 first


economy
 in
 the
 world
 and
 overtake
 the


United
 States.
 This
 was
 a
 little
 bit


before
 now
 the
 later
 books
 make
 a
 little


more
 sense.
 This
 is
 really
 before
 you


start
 to
 see
 the
 economic
 problems
 of


the
 United
 States
 that
 would
 make
 this


kind
 of
 interest
 and
 also
 before
 the


trade
 deficit
 with
 the
 United
 States
 had


really
 exploded.
 So
 he
 was
 a
 kind
 of


visionary
 not
 in
 that
 he
 got
 it
 right


but
 he
 kind
 of
 prefigured
 a
 genre
 of


books
 that
 would
 only
 really
 hit
 about
 a


decade
 or
 so
 later.
 Yeah,
 Joe,
 I
 clipped


this,
 but
 reading
 some
 of
 the
 book
 now,


it's
 kind
 of
 quaint,
 but
 he
 says
 his


best
 estimate
 is
 his
 medium
 scenario.


And
 the
 medium
 scenario
 is
 that
 Japan


probably
 passes
 the
 US
 in
 per
 capita


income
 around
 1990.


>> Okay.


>> And
 probably
 equals
 the
 US
 in
 uh
 gross


national
 product
 by
 about
 the
 year
 2000.


That's
 the
 media.


>> The
 media.
 So
 it
 could
 have
 been


>> he's
 being
 conservative.


>> But
 it
 sounds
 interesting
 because
 it's


very
 easy
 to
 say
 oh
 this
 is
 going to
 be


a
 big
 problem
 once
 the
 trade
 deficit
 is


gigantic
 right
 like
 oh
 we're
 really


dependent
 we
 we're
 you
 know
 up
 a
 creek


etc.
 But
 he
 seemed
 to
 have
 some


intuition
 that
 there
 was
 something
 there


in
 Japan
 that
 was
 like
 okay
 there's
 some


going
 to
 be
 some
 great
 out
 competing
 in


terms
 of
 just
 based
 on
 their


productivity.


>> Yeah
 I
 think
 that
 he
 observed
 correctly


that
 Japan
 had
 made
 a
 miraculous


comeback
 after
 the
 war.
 they
 had


transformed
 themselves
 from
 being


totally
 destroyed
 in
 the
 world
 and
 to


being
 from
 being
 kind
 of
 a
 producer
 of


goods
 that
 were
 considered
 kind
 of
 cheap


just
 in
 the
 way
 we
 used
 to
 think
 made
 in


China
 or
 made
 in
 Taiwan
 weren't


necessarily
 signs
 of
 quality
 and
 then


Japan
 becomes
 you
 know
 a
 place
 where
 it


>> manufactures
 items
 that
 are
 still
 not


terribly
 expensive
 but
 are
 known
 for


engineering
 feats
 and
 are
 quite
 good
 and


he
 also
 gets
 into
 some
 things
 you
 we


might
 today
 call
 orientalist
 or


centralizing
 but
 he
 had
 these
 what
 he


thought
 were
 soci
 ological
 insights


about
 the
 solidity
 of
 Japanese
 society,


of
 their
 education
 system,
 of
 the


relationships
 between
 the
 state
 and


businesses,
 and
 other
 writers
 kind
 of


develop
 these
 themes
 in
 different


directions.


>> Maybe
 we'll
 get
 into
 this.
 Peter


Navaro's
 book
 Death
 by
 China
 came
 out
 in


2011.
 He
 was
 pretty
 ahead
 of
 the
 curve


in
 terms
 of,
 you
 know,
 2011,
 not


certainly
 not
 as
 much
 as
 people
 are


talking
 about
 today,


>> but
 in
 a
 way
 it
 wasn't
 the
 real
 China


shock
 in
 the
 US.


>> Definitely.
 Yeah,


>> that
 was
 like
 the
 whole
 WTO
 thing.
 I


feel
 like
 that
 was
 really
 when
 it
 kind


of
 peaked.
 You
 mentioned
 the
 cultural


aspects
 of
 this
 and
 it
 is
 funny
 reading


again
 some
 of
 the
 coverage
 where


everyone's
 like
 I
 read
 the
 chrysanthemum


and
 the
 sword
 or
 I
 read
 Mishima
 and
 now


I've
 cracked
 the
 code
 of
 Japanese


economic
 success.
 But
 so
 much
 of
 the


panic
 was
 actually
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


how
 Japan
 had
 done
 this.
 Um
 before
 we


get
 into
 all
 those
 different


interpretations,
 what's
 your
 story
 of


the
 Japanese
 economic
 miracle
 in
 the


1980s?


>> You
 know,
 I
 think
 that
 you
 have
 it's


there's
 obviously
 the
 actual
 economic


facts
 and
 the
 relationship
 of
 the
 United


States
 with
 Japan
 and
 then
 there
 is
 the


discourse
 about
 it.


>> I
 think
 what
 happened
 is
 you
 had
 a


situation
 where
 you
 had
 the
 beginnings


of
 de-industrialization
 in
 the
 United


States.
 You
 had
 a
 very
 strong
 dollar.


You
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 products
 that
 were


coming
 in
 that
 were
 extremely
 high


quality
 and
 attractive
 to
 American


consumers.
 You
 also
 had
 some
 policies


that
 are
 very
 strange.
 Caterpillar
 was
 a


big
 competitor
 with
 Komasu.
 They
 went
 to


the
 Reagan
 administration.
 They
 brought


this
 economic
 study
 to
 the
 Reagan


administration
 and
 they
 said,
 "Well,
 we


want
 to
 open
 up
 Japan's
 financial


markets
 because
 the
 the
 difference
 in


our
 currencies
 is
 causing
 this
 problem."


Now
 this
 doesn't
 even
 make
 sense
 in


economic
 theory.
 What
 what
 what
 actually


happened
 is
 Japan
 is
 the
 country
 with


excess
 savings.
 So
 Japanese
 investments


began
 to
 flow
 into
 the
 United
 States.


Caterpillar
 suddenly
 finds
 Kumasu
 with
 a


plant
 next
 door
 to
 it.
 So
 this
 little


scheme
 to
 undermine
 its
 competitors


through
 through
 currency
 wizardry
 didn't


work.
 The
 Reagan
 administration
 was
 open


to
 it
 because
 they
 were
 into
 free
 trade


stuff.
 So
 it
 didn't
 really
 break
 with


their
 ideology
 but
 it
 was
 a
 strange
 move


that
 backfired.
 And
 then
 also
 Japanese


investors
 were
 used
 to
 very
 meager


returns
 and
 the
 United
 States
 had
 very


attractive
 investments
 going
 on
 at
 that


time
 like
 treasuries
 because
 of
 the


vulkar
 policies
 had
 very
 high
 returns.


So
 Japanese
 savers
 were
 very
 interested


in
 them


>> and
 Japanese


investors
 also
 started
 to
 look
 at
 real


assets
 like
 they
 started
 to
 look
 at
 real


estate
 and
 the
 returns
 on
 those
 things


were
 so
 fantastic
 compared
 to
 the
 way


things
 were
 in
 Japan.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 Mitsubishi
 bought
 the


Rockefeller
 Center.


>> They
 bought
 the
 Rockefeller
 Center.


There
 was
 talk
 of
 Nintendo
 buying
 the


Seattle
 Mariners.
 There
 was
 there
 was
 a


lot
 of
 purchasing
 a
 lot
 of
 downtown
 LA.


You
 mentioned
 the
 Nakatomi
 Tower.
 like


there
 was
 all
 this
 idea
 of
 J
 Japan


investing
 in
 American
 real
 estate
 and


buying
 quintessentially
 American


properties
 and
 this
 was
 kind
 of


upsetting
 to
 people.
 So
 the
 trade


deficit
 was
 obviously
 upsetting
 people


who
 actually
 had
 a
 skin
 in
 the
 game
 of


the
 industries
 workers
 the
 businesses


Leakoko
 was
 not
 very
 happy
 about
 it.
 He


wrote
 about
 it
 and
 complained
 about
 it


on
 TV.
 But
 the
 actual
 purchasing
 of


American
 like
 these
 kind
 of
 symbols
 of


Americana


made
 people
 kind
 of
 get
 more
 tense
 about


this
 nationalistic
 fervor.
 So
 yeah,
 the


money
 was
 just
 flowing
 in
 and
 at
 that


time
 with
 the
 United
 States
 had
 a
 lot
 of


deficit
 spending
 and
 we
 were
 pumping
 out


ships
 and
 military
 equipment
 and
 the


interest
 in
 Japanese
 savers
 in
 American


treasuries
 just
 came
 along
 at
 the
 right


time.
 Paul
 Sonis
 who
 was
 I
 don't
 know


how
 many
 of your
 listeners
 are
 going
 to


remember
 him.


>> I
 do.


>> Okay.
 So,
 he
 was
 kind
 of


>> I
 don't
 centrist
 businessfriendly


democratic
 politician
 who
 was
 a


candidate
 for
 president.
 Not
 someone
 you


would
 expect
 to
 kind
 of
 like
 demagogue


on
 populist
 terms,
 but
 he
 said
 in
 a


speech
 the
 UAW,
 "The
 Cold
 War
 is
 over


and
 Japan
 won."


>> This
 is
 obviously
 a
 huge
 exaggeration,


but
 it
 was
 more
 like
 the
 Cold
 War
 ended


and
 Japan
 kind
 of
 paid
 for
 it.
 So,
 I
 can


understand
 from
 the
 perspective
 of
 Japan


when
 they're
 seeing
 these
 things
 bubble


up
 and
 anger
 bubble
 up
 in
 America,


they're
 like,
 "We
 thought
 we
 were


competitors
 a
 little
 bit,
 but


>> Right."
 But
 but
 not
 this
 much.
 Mostly


mostly
 friendly.


>> Mostly
 friendly.
 Yeah.


>> What
 was
 Trump
 doing
 this
 time?
 Did
 he


have
 Where
 was
 Trump
 in
 all
 this?


>> He
 was
 extremely
 upset
 about
 both
 the


trade
 deficits
 with
 Japan
 and
 the


investment
 in
 Japanese.


>> He's
 been
 very
 consistent.


>> He's
 been
 extremely
 consistent.
 He
 he


published
 ads
 in
 the
 newspaper.
 He
 went


on
 TV
 and
 complained
 about
 it.
 He
 said


Japanese
 Japan
 was
 ripping
 us
 off
 and


Japan
 was
 buying
 all
 these
 wonderful


American
 things
 that
 should
 belong
 to


us.
 So
 that
 economic
 nationalism
 goes


way
 back
 when.
 And
 there
 might
 be
 an


argument
 that
 his
 pretextious
 instincts


were
 really
 shaped
 by
 that
 encounter


with
 Japan
 as
 a
 potential
 rival.


>> So
 I
 think
 that
 you
 know
 the
 Japan
 panic


and
 Trump
 kind
 of
 being
 of
 another
 age


in
 a
 certain
 way.
 Um
 although
 again
 some


of
 these
 things
 apply
 well
 to
 to
 It's


like
 left
 its
 fingerprints
 on
 American


society,
 hasn't
 it?


>> Absolutely.
 Absolutely.
 So,
 I
 think
 that


weirdly
 those
 unconscious
 impressions
 or


or
 institutional
 knowledge
 or
 just


hang-ups
 that
 stick
 with
 individuals


definitely.
 And
 you
 know,
 he
 may
 just


still
 be
 thinking
 of
 Japan,
 Japan,


Japan.


[Music]


It's
 interesting
 because
 with
 the
 China


anxiety
 these
 days
 like
 the
 fear
 is


right
 some
 breakthrough
 is
 going
 to


happen
 with
 semiconductors
 or
 something


in
 China
 and
 the
 American
 companies
 will


just
 sort
 of
 go
 out
 of
 business
 etc.
 But


in
 the
 anxiety
 with
 Japan
 was
 like
 your


boss
 is
 going
 to
 be
 Japanese
 or
 the
 name


of
 the
 office
 building
 that
 you
 go
 to


will
 be
 renamed
 Japanese
 etc.
 That's


very
 different
 because
 people
 don't


really
 talk
 about
 that
 we're
 all
 going


to
 be
 working
 for
 Chinese
 international


corporations
 in
 the
 future,


>> right?
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 image
 of


dystopia
 in
 the
 80s
 like
 in
 cyberpunk


literature
 or
 in
 Bladeunner,
 it's
 a
 lot


of
 Japanese
 company
 signage
 and
 a
 city


of
 mixed
 ethnic
 makeup
 that
 looks
 very


chaotic.
 It
 looks
 a
 lot
 like
 cities
 in


Japan.
 So
 yeah,
 I
 think
 people
 were


really
 thought
 and
 I
 think
 it
 was
 just


kind
 of
 common
 sense.
 If
 you
 got
 into
 a


if
 you
 took
 an
 airplane
 ride
 and
 you
 got


into
 a
 conversation
 with
 businessman


next
 to
 you,
 guy
 who
 owned
 a
 small


business,
 he
 had
 read
 in
 magazines,


newspapers,
 books,
 he
 everyone
 kind
 of


like
 the
 mi
 I'm
 sorry
 to
 use
 this
 meme,


the
 midwake
 at
 the
 time
 was
 sort
 of
 like


Japan
 is
 going
 to
 take
 over
 the
 United


States.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 So
 clearly
 that
 did
 not
 happen.


No.
 Um,
 and
 the
 per
 capita
 income
 of


Japan
 is
 still
 a
 lot
 lower
 than
 the
 US.


Walk
 us
 through
 like
 I
 guess
 the


bursting
 of
 the
 bubble
 and
 what
 exactly


like
 why
 this
 vision
 of
 Japan
 as
 a


superstate
 or
 whatever
 did
 not
 come
 to


pass.


>> You
 know what's
 really
 interesting
 is


that
 the
 that
 the
 panic
 coincided
 not


with
 the
 peak
 of
 Japanese
 power
 but
 with


about
 the
 asset
 bubble
 bursting.
 So
 you


see
 in
 1992


Rising
 Sun,
 the
 Michael
 Kiteon
 book
 come


out
 and
 then
 and
 that
 also


>> you
 top
 ticked
 it,
 huh?


>> Yeah.
 And


>> has
 anyone
 read
 it?


>> I
 have
 seen
 the
 movie.
 I
 have
 read
 the


book
 partially
 when
 I
 was
 doing
 research


for
 the
 book
 for
 my
 book.
 And
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 book,
 he
 included


a
 bibliography
 of
 books
 he
 had
 written


he
 had
 read
 about
 Japan
 that
 that


detailed
 the
 the
 the
 threat.
 The
 book
 is


not
 subtle.
 a
 group
 of
 Japanese


businessmen
 are
 involved
 in
 the
 murder


of
 a
 very
 beautiful
 blonde
 woman.
 Uh,


and
 the
 detective
 is
 tasked
 to
 find
 this


out
 and
 he
 has
 a
 meeting
 with
 a
 senator


and
 the
 senator
 they
 talk
 about
 maybe


the
 possibility
 of
 dropping
 another
 bomb


on
 Japan.
 That's
 another
 thing
 to


remember
 is
 that
 Japan,
 United
 States


and
 Japan
 in
 living
 memory
 had
 fought
 a


war
 and
 there
 was
 Pearl
 Harbor
 which


Americans
 felt
 very
 sensitive
 about.
 So


what
 happened
 was
 there
 was
 a


creditfueled
 bubble
 in
 Japan
 and
 it


burst
 and
 it
 was
 followed
 by
 a
 banking


crisis,
 deflation
 and
 then
 all
 of
 a


sudden


everything
 that
 everyone
 believed
 was
 so


wonderful
 about
 Japanese
 capitalism.
 So


in
 in
 1982,
 Charles
 Johnson
 wrote
 a
 book


called
 MIDI
 in
 the
 Japanese
 miracle.
 And


they
 said,
 okay,
 well,
 the
 reason
 why


they
 did
 it
 is
 because
 they
 had
 this


wonderful
 industrial
 policy
 which


coordinated
 investment,
 protected


industries,
 guided
 firms,
 and
 it
 was


kind
 of
 a
 mixture
 of
 state
 intervention


and
 private
 capitalism.
 That
 was
 one


theory
 that
 was
 a
 little
 different
 from


the
 theories
 that
 said,
 "Oh,
 the


Japanese
 have
 some
 special
 cultural
 uh


Confucianism
 or
 whatever."
 Shinto


Buddhism
 that
 was
 making
 them
 do
 this


and
 everyone
 said,
 "Oh,
 well,
 Japanese


firms
 are
 insulated
 from
 financial


markets,
 right?
 Because
 they
 have
 this


close
 relationship
 with
 banks.
 They


don't
 have
 to
 do
 they
 don't
 have
 to


raise
 funds
 on
 capital
 markets.
 They


have
 these
 long-standing
 relationships.


So,
 they
 can
 do
 these
 great
 long-term


development
 projects,
 research
 and


development
 projects.
 They're
 not


exposed
 to
 the
 quarterly
 pressures
 of


American
 companies,
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth.


Then
 after
 the
 bubble
 crashes,
 everyone


looks
 at
 all
 this
 stuff.


>> It's
 like,
 "Oh,
 wait."


>> They
 say,
 "Oh,
 this
 was
 a
 horrible


system
 of
 crony
 capitalism
 where
 the


government
 was
 protecting
 people
 and


there
 were
 bad
 loans
 on
 the
 books
 and
 if


there
 had
 been
 functioning
 markets
 and
 a


lot
 of
 these
 things
 wouldn't
 happen."
 So


suddenly
 all
 of
 the
 things
 that
 appeared


most
 of the
 things,
 not
 all
 of
 them,
 but


many
 of
 the
 things
 that
 appeared
 really


impressive
 about
 Japanese
 capitalism,


all
 of
 a
 sudden
 people
 discovered
 what


the
 downsides
 were.
 But
 this
 didn't
 set


in
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Japan
 was
 there


was
 an
 outflow.
 There
 was
 a
 sudden
 huge


outflow
 of
 Japanese
 funds.
 They
 had


invested.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 between
 1988
 to


the
 end
 of
 1990,


Japanese
 investors
 invested
 about
 $52


billion
 in
 the
 United
 States
 from
 you


know
 that
 includes
 everything
 from


buying
 companies
 to
 real
 estate
 to
 new


factories.
 And
 then
 in
 the
 first
 few


months
 of
 1992,


that
 figure
 had
 dropped
 to
 2.3
 billion


and
 they
 made
 a
 net
 investment
 of
 30


almost
 $
 31
 billion
 in
 securities
 and
 by


1992
 they
 were
 net
 sellers
 of
 government


securities.


>> They
 took
 some
 real
 baths
 like
 this


financier
 Manuro
 Isutani
 he
 and
 this
 was


one
 of
 these
 things
 that
 upset


Americans.
 He
 bought
 Pebble
 Beach.
 He


sold
 it
 for
 a
 loss
 of
 about
 $350


million.


Yeah.
 So,
 by
 the
 early
 1990s,
 the
 tide


was
 kind
 of
 going
 out,
 but
 the
 upset


wasn't.
 And
 part
 of
 why
 this
 happened


was
 the
 United
 States
 still
 had
 a
 close


economic
 relationship,
 but
 there
 was
 a


election
 going
 on
 and
 a
 Japanese
 pol


election
 the
 United
 States
 and
 a


Japanese
 politician
 made
 a
 very


inmperate
 remark
 about
 the
 appearance


and
 abilities
 of
 American
 workers.
 He


said
 that
 they
 were
 not
 able
 to
 read
 in


many
 cases
 that
 they
 were
 overweight
 and


this
 caused
 a
 massive
 rage
 in
 the
 United


States
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 politicians
 going


into
 the
 election
 year
 obviously
 jin


this
 up.


>> We
 talk
 about
 '92
 here.


>> This
 is
 this
 is
 in
 1992.


>> Oh,
 is
 this
 the
 whole
 Atari
 Democrat


thing?


>> The
 Atari
 Democrats
 are
 a
 little


different.
 They
 wanted
 they
 were
 among


the
 people
 who
 were
 really
 curious
 about


I
 think
 state
 industrial
 policy
 in


Japan.
 I
 missed
 this
 whole
 era
 of


American
 history,
 by
 the
 way.
 Firstly,


because
 I
 was
 like
 8
 years
 old,
 but


secondly,
 because
 I
 was
 in
 Japan.
 We


didn't
 hear
 a
 lot
 about
 it.
 So,


>> Well,
 you
 were
 there
 as
 it
 as
 the
 bubble


popped.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 never
 I
 have
 no
 memories
 of


experiencing
 this
 feeling
 of
 Japanese


supremacy.
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 memories
 of


feeling
 like
 the
 economy
 was
 very


downbeat.


>> Oh,
 wow.
 in
 the
 sort
 of
 early
 2000s
 when


I
 came
 back
 and
 when
 I
 was
 actually
 a


teenager
 and
 sort
 of
 aware
 of
 my


surroundings.


>> Yeah.
 Did
 you
 ever
 get
 the
 sense
 that


they
 felt
 like
 it
 was
 a
 miss
 it
 was
 a


lost
 golden
 era
 or
 a
 missed
 opportunity?


>> I
 mean
 I
 think
 there
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 of


nostalgia
 certainly
 in
 the
 finance


community.
 Um
 you
 know
 people
 could


remember
 what
 the
 dealmaking
 days
 were


actually
 like
 but
 beyond
 that
 I'm
 not


entirely
 sure.


>> Gotcha.
 This
 summer,
 all
 the
 bros
 read


Ezra
 Vogel's
 Deng
 Shop
 biography,
 but
 he


also
 wrote,
 and
 I
 think
 you
 talk
 about


he
 wrote
 a
 Japan
 book
 in
 1979,
 Japan
 is


number
 one
 lessons
 for
 America,
 which
 I


think
 you
 talk
 about.
 Is
 that
 does
 that


book
 hold
 up?
 Was
 it
 good?


>> I
 think
 that
 that
 book
 is
 one
 of
 the
 one


of
 the
 more
 serious
 books.
 I
 mean,
 you


know,
 he's
 a
 real
 scholar
 and
 and
 it
 was


more
 a
 real
 analysis
 of
 institutions.
 It


doesn't
 get
 into
 the
 kind
 of
 there
 may


be
 a
 little
 armchair
 sociology
 in
 there


about
 Japanese
 cultural
 mores,
 but


there's
 definitely
 much
 more
 hard


analysis
 of
 the
 relationship
 between


government
 and
 business
 in
 Japan.


>> Let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 about


actually
 1992
 and
 the
 politics
 of
 that


time.
 You
 mentioned
 Paul
 Sis.


>> Yeah,


>> he
 did
 win
 a
 primary
 somewhere,
 didn't


he?
 Like
 win
 New
 Hampshire
 or
 something.


Anyway,
 but
 more
 importantly,
 that
 was


also
 the
 year
 that
 Ross
 Perau
 ran
 as
 an


independent
 and
 then
 he
 dropped
 out
 and


then
 he
 got
 back
 in
 the
 race
 and
 he
 had


a
 pretty
 good
 showing.
 He
 may
 have


tipped
 the
 election
 to
 Clinton.
 I
 think


there's
 some
 debate
 about
 that.
 I
 know


his
 main
 focus
 was
 NAFTA.


>> But
 was
 this
 was
 the
 was
 there
 a
 Japan


element
 to
 his
 populism?
 There
 was
 no


one
 in
 in
 in
 politics
 at
 that
 time
 who


was
 worried
 about
 the
 future
 of
 American


economy,
 industry,
 even
 our
 political


supremacy
 in
 the
 world
 that
 was
 not


fixated
 or
 focused
 or
 had
 a
 comment
 to


say
 about
 Japan.
 And
 Ross
 Pearl
 was
 not


an
 exception.
 He
 was
 both
 a


protectionist.
 So
 he
 thought
 that
 the


United
 States's
 trade
 policies
 were


giving
 us
 were
 leaving
 us
 in
 a
 bad
 place


with
 regards
 to
 not
 only
 Japan
 but
 also


at
 that
 time
 West
 Germany
 German


unification
 had
 just
 happened
 and
 South


Korea
 but
 he
 also


was
 very
 curious
 about
 the
 way
 he


believed
 he
 wasn't
 really
 much
 he
 was
 a


big
 capitalist
 not
 much
 of
 a
 free
 trader


so
 he
 was
 really
 attracted
 to
 the
 close


relationship
 between
 business
 and


government
 in
 Japan
 And
 he
 also
 was
 very


proud
 of
 the
 close-knit
 nature
 of
 his


companies.
 A
 delegation
 of
 Japanese


businessmen,
 I
 think
 from
 Toyota,
 came


to
 visit
 Electronic
 Data
 Systems,
 his


his
 firm,
 and
 they
 praised
 him
 and
 they


said,
 "You're
 of
 all
 the
 companies
 in


the
 United
 States,
 you're
 the
 most


Japanese."


>> I
 bet
 they
 said
 that
 to
 everyone,


>> maybe,
 probably.
 But
 he
 was
 extremely


proud.
 He
 was
 like,
 he
 said,
 "Every


worker
 is
 a
 brother.
 That's
 my
 that's


the
 way
 Japanese
 companies
 run
 and


that's
 the
 way
 I
 run."
 So
 he
 thought
 we


needed
 to
 adopt
 policies
 more
 like
 Japan


of
 between
 cooperation
 of
 business
 and


government.


>> This
 is
 something
 I
 find
 so
 interesting


because
 in
 the
 Japan
 panic
 at
 that
 time


like
 one
 of
 the
 thoughts
 was
 well
 Japan


is
 very
 bureaucratic
 but
 in
 a
 good
 way.


It's
 very
 like
 consensus
 driven
 and
 we


have
 big
 groups
 of
 people
 who
 get


together
 and
 make
 a
 decision
 that's
 good


for
 everyone.
 And
 then
 when
 you
 fast


forward
 to
 today
 and
 all
 the
 angst
 about


China,
 it's
 very
 much
 like
 well
 China


has
 an
 authoritarian
 system
 of


government
 and
 China
 can
 decide
 by
 a


single
 person
 uh
 what
 it's
 going
 to
 do.


It's
 going to
 build
 like
 a
 huge


high-speed
 rail
 and
 that's
 not
 consensus


driven.
 It's
 funny
 how
 it
 kind
 of


flipped.


>> Yeah,
 that
 is
 interesting.
 I
 there


wasn't
 the
 sense
 that
 there
 was


direction
 or
 command
 and
 there
 was
 like


a
 really
 strong
 political
 system
 behind


all
 this.
 It
 was
 a
 series
 of,
 you
 know,


on
 the
 smarter
 end,
 really
 good


institutions
 and
 great
 education.
 On
 the


more
 pulpy,
 poppy
 end
 of
 cultural


essential
 features
 that
 made
 them


extremely
 good
 at
 this.
 The
 way
 that


they
 presented
 Japan
 was
 like
 there's
 no


center
 of
 power.
 This
 is
 an
 interlocking


Borgl
 like
 corporations
 and
 businesses


are
 all
 cooperating
 in
 different
 ways.


It
 wasn't
 like,
 oh,
 there's
 an


authoritarian
 state
 with
 a
 leader.
 This


leaderless
 authoritarianism.
 And
 there


was
 some
 kind
 of
 fears
 that
 were


reminiscent
 maybe
 you
 got
 to
 also


remember
 that
 the
 cold
 war
 is
 winding


up.
 The
 Soviet
 Union
 is
 no
 longer
 the


primary
 opponent
 or
 rival
 United
 States.


So
 the
 collectivism
 of
 Japan
 becomes
 the


thing
 that's
 set
 against
 American
 free


enterprise
 and
 rugged
 individualism.


Some
 people
 view
 that
 in
 a
 it's
 a
 it's


an
 interesting
 mix
 of
 admiration
 and


envy
 and
 also
 kind
 of
 fear
 and
 saying,


"Oh,
 we're
 not
 like
 that
 as
 Americans."


So,
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 different.
 I
 mean,


it's
 also
 different
 because
 the
 United


States
 and
 Japan
 were
 ostensibly


military
 allies.
 They
 were
 in
 the
 same


kind
 of
 block
 in
 the
 Cold
 War.
 They
 were


arguably
 part
 of
 our
 empire,
 kind
 of


under
 our
 protection.
 The
 discourse
 was


that
 the
 that
 Japan
 was
 sneakily
 kind
 of


getting
 out
 from
 under
 American
 hegemony


to
 set
 up
 their
 own.
 And
 that
 doesn't


make
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 sense
 in
 historical


retrospect
 or
 even
 was
 a
 possibility.


>> No,


>> China
 was
 obviously
 never
 had
 that
 kind


of
 relationship
 with
 the
 United
 States.


They
 were
 always
 I
 mean
 they
 were
 we


organized
 a
 reproachment
 with
 them
 but


they
 were
 never
 an
 ally
 or
 even
 one


might
 say
 I
 don't
 I
 think
 vassal
 state


is
 putting
 it
 far
 too
 strongly
 but
 but
 a


part
 of
 the
 western
 block.


>> This
 is
 I
 want
 this
 is
 exactly
 where
 I


wanted
 to
 go
 to
 because
 one
 obvious


difference
 besides
 the
 pop
 culture
 and


everything
 else
 with
 US
 China
 is
 that


today
 in
 2025


there
 are
 people
 who
 are
 very
 worried


about
 war
 with
 China.
 If
 China
 were
 to


forcibly
 were
 to
 blockade
 Taiwan,
 would


DC
 feel
 impelled
 to
 enter
 a
 war?
 Is
 the


Chinese
 industrial
 might
 going
 to
 sort


of
 hollow
 out
 our
 capacity
 to
 even
 like


build
 weapons
 at
 some
 point
 because
 we


don't
 have
 any
 efficient
 factories
 in


the
 United
 States.
 I
 mean,
 that
 is
 a


very
 that's
 very
 different,
 right?
 Were


there
 shades
 of
 that?


>> There
 were
 some
 very
 small
 shades
 of
 it.


The
 more
 hysterical
 books
 imagined
 a


shooting
 war
 between
 the
 United
 States


and
 Japan,
 a
 Japanese
 total


re-industrialization
 that
 included


remilitarization.


>> This
 doesn't
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 because


Japan
 is
 very
 insistent
 on
 his
 pacifism.


I
 mean,
 that
 might
 be
 changing
 now,
 but


this
 that
 fear
 was
 really
 not
 one
 of
 the


more
 realistic
 ones
 projections.
 So,


there
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 worry
 about


that.
 I
 think
 people
 were
 fantasizing


and
 imagining
 Japan
 as
 a
 rival
 to
 the


United
 States
 that
 would
 eventually
 be
 a


military
 rival
 or
 could
 be
 a
 military


rival.


>> But
 no,
 from
 so
 far
 as
 I
 know,
 there
 was


one
 book,
 The
 Coming
 War
 with
 Japan.


Most
 of
 the
 others
 viewed
 it
 as
 a


economic
 war
 and
 a
 cultural
 war.
 But
 the


fantasy
 of


>> like
 they
 were
 gonna
 do
 Pat
 Buchanan
 had


an
 essay
 in
 a
 book
 about
 trade
 policy


where
 he
 talked
 about
 they've
 decided


after
 losing
 World
 War
 II
 they're
 going


to
 take
 the
 economic
 road
 to
 build
 their


empire.
 So
 it
 was
 more
 like
 using
 war
 as


a
 metaphor
 but
 there
 was
 I
 think
 fewer


worries
 about
 the
 actual
 military
 might


which
 makes
 sense.


[Music]


[Music]


Can
 I
 push
 back
 on
 one
 thing
 which
 is


the
 premise
 of
 this
 entire
 conversation


please?


>> No,
 but
 the
 way
 we
 started
 out
 we
 were


talking
 about
 like
 the
 Japan
 panic


really
 resonated
 with
 America
 and
 I


guess
 my
 question
 is
 like
 yes
 there
 were


books.
 Yes,
 there
 were
 some
 characters


in
 movies
 and
 things
 like
 that,
 but
 did


it
 actually
 resonate
 in
 the
 political
 or


social
 sense?
 Because,
 you
 know,
 I'm


looking
 at
 a
 headline
 right
 now
 from


1992
 and
 it
 says,
 "Harsh
 views
 on
 Japan


may
 help
 fuel
 Perau
 campaign."
 Well,


Perau
 ran
 unsuccessfully
 for
 president.


So,
 I
 would
 argue
 they
 did
 not
 in
 fact


help
 him.
 Well,
 I
 would
 say
 that
 he
 had


the
 most
 successful
 third
 party


candidate


in
 recent
 about
 20%
 of
 the
 vote,
 which


is
 significant.
 I
 think
 about
 twothirds


of
 Americans
 by
 1989
 believed
 I
 mean


there's
 reason
 for
 this
 because
 the


Soviet
 Union
 looked
 like
 it
 was
 on
 its


last
 legs
 but
 believed
 that
 Japan
 was
 a


bigger
 threat
 than
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 and


a
 lot
 of
 politicians
 went
 on
 the
 stump.


Songis
 tried
 to
 Japan
 bash
 as
 they


called
 it.
 Pat
 Buchanan
 went
 to
 pan


bashing
 Clinton
 less
 so
 but
 I
 would
 say


there
 was
 a
 side
 of
 Clinton's
 campaign


and
 a
 side
 of
 his
 eventual
 staffing
 of


his
 of
 his
 administration
 that
 was


definitely
 a
 lot
 closer
 in
 thinking
 to


the
 people
 who
 are
 worried
 both
 worried


about
 and
 and
 admiring
 of
 Japan.
 They


went
 in
 with
 the
 intention
 of
 being


really
 hard-nosed
 about
 certain
 trade


negotiations
 and
 they
 also
 and
 this
 is


not
 we
 talk
 a
 lot
 about
 industrial


policy.
 There
 was
 discussion
 of


industrial
 policy
 back
 then.
 There
 was
 a


side
 of
 the
 Clinton
 administration
 that


looked
 at
 Japanese
 industrial
 policy


and
 protectionism
 and
 said
 this
 looked


very
 interesting.


>> We
 may
 be
 living
 in
 a
 very
 different


world
 if
 the
 bubble
 doesn't
 pop
 in
 Japan


and
 those
 policies
 start
 to
 make
 more


sense.
 So
 the
 side
 of
 the
 Clinton


administration,
 I
 mean,
 that
 that
 is


both
 interested
 and
 wants
 to
 take
 a


tougher
 eye
 on
 Japan,
 it
 kind
 of
 becomes


a
 moot
 point
 as
 Japanese
 economy
 kind
 of


collapses
 and
 fades
 away.
 So
 it
 was
 a


really
 pivotal
 moment
 and
 yeah,
 I
 think


that
 it's
 such
 a
 strange
 thing
 that
 it


was
 everybody
 was
 fixated
 on
 it.
 It
 was


such
 common
 sense.
 Politicians
 ran
 on


it,
 arguably
 demagogued
 on
 it.
 And
 then


it's
 kind
 of a
 historical
 curiosity.
 M


yeah no


>> can
 I
 ask
 one
 more
 question
 which
 I


don't
 know
 if
 you'll
 have
 the
 answer
 to


this
 but
 I've
 always
 wondered
 about
 it


>> why
 was
 there
 not
 as
 much
 hand
 ringing


over
 Korea
 say
 cuz
 on
 the
 face
 of
 it


this
 is
 a
 country
 that
 also
 very
 rapidly


developed
 economically
 also
 had
 similar


relationships
 with
 the
 US
 US
 military


presence
 and
 some
 US
 investment
 and


things
 like
 that
 but
 it
 all
 seemed
 to
 be


directed
 at
 Japan
 rather
 than
 Korea


I
 think
 that
 that
 is
 because
 of
 the


United
 States's
 history
 with
 Japan
 and


the
 war
 which
 had
 it
 in
 our
 imagination.


I
 think
 also
 Japan
 at
 that
 time
 was
 a


kind
 of
 cultural
 hegeimon
 in
 East
 Asia


in
 the
 way
 that
 maybe
 South
 Korea
 is
 now


in
 terms
 of
 their
 exports
 of
 pop
 culture


and
 video
 games
 and
 art
 and
 music
 and
 so


on
 and
 so
 forth.
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 big


part
 of
 it.
 I
 think
 also
 there's
 a
 great


book
 by
 an
 author
 Drew
 McKivik
 called


Consuming
 Japan.
 I
 think
 Japan
 in
 a
 way


was
 a
 lot
 of
 Americans
 fir
 and
 he
 argues


that
 Japan
 in
 a
 way
 was
 a
 lot
 of


Americans
 first
 contact
 with


globalization


and
 it
 was
 both
 very
 interesting
 but


also
 a
 little
 scary
 and
 alien
 and
 I


think
 perhaps
 China
 the
 rise
 of
 China


the
 rise
 of
 South
 Korea
 it
 doesn't
 look


so
 weird
 anymore
 because
 we
 went
 through


the
 experience
 of
 Japan
 and
 also
 because


the
 experience
 of
 Japan
 kind
 of
 turned


into
 a
 nothing
 so
 perhaps
 some
 of
 the


culture
 memory
 of
 that
 or
 the


familiarity
 we
 have
 with
 other
 cultures


from
 Japan.
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 we


Americans
 are
 so
 used
 to
 are
 more


cosmopolitan
 than
 I
 would
 say
 than
 we


are
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 80s.
 Yeah.


>> Japan
 throughout
 all
 of
 this.
 I
 mean
 it


was
 cool,
 right?
 Like
 Sony
 Walkman
 were


always
 cool
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 People


look
 at
 this
 the
 Chinese
 EVs
 and
 they're


very
 impressive,
 right?


>> I
 don't
 know
 if
 any
 of
 them
 are
 like


cool.
 like
 we
 don't
 really
 have
 Chinese


branded
 other
 than
 Laboos
 actually,


which
 I
 think
 is
 like
 the
 first
 time


there
 was
 a
 specific
 Chinesemade


Capital
 B
 brand
 that
 sort
 of


>> I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 like
 we
 joked
 about


doing
 a
 Libu
 episode
 before,
 but
 like
 I


think
 we
 actually
 should
 cuz
 this
 is


probably
 China's
 like
 biggest
 cultural


export


>> ever
 thing.
 But
 like
 Japan
 is
 just
 so


cool
 that


>> they
 created
 a
 lot
 of
 really
 inexpensive


but
 extremely
 interesting
 and
 fun


devices.
 I
 mean,
 and


>> and
 I
 missed
 my
 Game
 Boy.
 I
 got
 to
 say


>> I
 missed
 my
 Miniis
 player
 and
 it
 wasn't


even
 that
 useful.
 It
 was
 just
 really
 It


was
 just
 really
 neat.
 Yeah.


>> Nintendo,
 right?


>> Nintendo,
 Sega.
 The
 design
 was
 terrific.


>> I
 think
 one
 thing
 that
 Japan
 and
 this


was
 also
 American
 businesses
 were
 really


curious
 about
 how
 Japan
 did.
 They
 said,


"Oh,
 they
 have
 all
 these
 wonderful
 craft


traditions
 and
 all
 these
 wonderful
 craft


traditions
 are
 not
 left
 behind.
 They're


incorporated
 into
 industrial


production."


>> Detail
 oriented


>> detail
 oriented
 engineering.
 a
 lot
 of


paying
 attention
 to
 design
 and


aesthetics.
 So
 that
 I
 think
 was
 a
 big


reason
 why
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 products
 were


really
 nicely
 designed.
 I
 think
 it's
 a


sad
 thing
 in
 a
 way.
 I
 think
 there's
 a


little
 bit
 of
 of
 China
 of
 people
 think


starting
 to
 think
 Chinese
 cars
 are
 cool.


Japanese
 cars
 were
 always
 like
 that's


reliable
 and
 wellb
 built.
 But
 they


weren't
 like
 they
 were
 kind
 of
 like
 it's


a
 little
 boring.


>> Okay.


>> To
 own
 a
 Japanese
 car.
 Japanese


electronics
 I
 think
 were
 always
 like


this
 is
 really
 neat.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 not


necessarily
 maybe
 Lexus
 was
 the


exception,
 right?
 But
 Toyota,
 Honda,
 I


think
 these
 were
 Oh,
 this
 very
 practical


practical
 choice.
 I
 think
 there's
 a


little
 bit
 of
 chi
 of
 Chinese
 car
 culture


starting
 that's
 like,
 oh
 yeah,
 they're


really
 making
 some
 cool
 looking
 stuff


over
 there
 now.
 And
 also,
 there
 is
 a


beginning,
 you
 know,
 you
 see
 lots
 of
 Tik


Toks
 and
 reals
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth
 of


Japanese
 of
 of
 I'm
 sorry,
 Chinese


cities.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 beginning
 of
 I


don't
 know
 want
 to
 call
 it
 China
 chic,


but
 definitely
 like
 wow
 amazing
 things


are
 happening
 in
 China.
 So,
 I
 think


there's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that.


>> I'm
 not
 a
 young
 person
 anymore.
 So,
 I'm


not
 and
 I
 I
 think
 there's
 also
 just


like,


>> you
 know,
 Apple
 is
 so
 dominant
 in
 in


consumer
 electronics
 and
 you
 don't
 need


that
 many
 devices
 anymore,
 right?
 So
 the


fact
 is
 we
 don't
 need
 CD
 players,
 we


don't
 need
 Walkman,
 we
 don't
 need
 minis,


we
 don't
 need
 all
 these
 different


things.
 So
 there
 there
 was
 this
 like


kind
 of
 wonderful
 market
 that
 had
 all


these
 different
 interesting
 gadgets
 in


it.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 that
 fascinated


people
 and
 your
 phone
 or
 your
 computer


does
 all
 of
 that
 now.


>> I
 find
 that
 to
 be
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 just
 a


factor
 totally
 of
 aging
 and
 nostalgia,


but
 as
 we
 were
 just
 saying,
 I
 find
 that


to
 be
 a
 little
 sad
 and
 thought
 those


devices
 were
 actually
 better
 in
 certain


ways.
 Yeah,


>> Joe,
 I
 just
 remember
 the
 car
 my
 mom
 had


in
 Tokyo
 in
 the
 early
 1990s.


>> What
 was
 it?


>> It
 was
 called
 My
 Fair
 Lady.


>> Wait,
 what?


>> It
 was
 manufactured
 by
 Nissan
 and
 it
 was


actually
 a
 really
 cool
 looking
 car,
 but


it
 had
 a
 terrible
 name.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know


if
 it
 would
 be
 considered
 cool
 or
 not.


>> They
 often
 switch
 names.
 I
 think
 when


they
 came
 to
 the
 United
 States,
 they


would
 have
 consultants
 tell
 them
 that


branding
 would


>> Nissan
 Fair
 Lady
 Z.


>> I
 think
 so.
 I'd
 have
 to
 like
 really
 nice


looking
 car.


>> It
 was
 some
 sort
 of
 sports
 car.


>> Like
 a
 Citron
 almost.


>> That
 looks
 cooler
 than
 I
 would
 associate


with
 a
 typical


>> Yeah.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 going to
 be
 some


kind
 of
 like
 minivan
 or
 Suburban.


>> Yeah.
 Wow.


>> Yeah.
 Very
 cool.


>> That's
 an
 extremely
 cool
 looking
 car.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah,
 it
 was.
 It
 just
 had
 a
 very
 strange


name.
 I
 always
 remember
 that.
 I
 remember


like
 staring
 at
 the
 steering
 wheel


because
 I
 think
 it
 was
 like
 printed
 on


it.
 Anyway,
 back
 to
 the
 topic
 at
 hand.


So
 there
 are
 clearly
 parallels
 between


the
 Japan
 panic
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 fear


around
 China
 at
 the
 moment.
 On
 the
 other


hand,
 there
 do
 seem
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 big


differences.
 Uh
 number
 one,
 China
 is
 not


a
 tiny
 island
 with
 a
 lack
 of
 natural


resources
 and
 farmable
 land
 and
 things


like
 that.
 It
 has
 a
 much
 bigger


population.


Walk
 us
 through
 where
 you
 see
 the


biggest
 areas,
 I
 guess,
 of
 similarity


and
 difference.


>> I
 mean,
 exports
 were
 a
 big
 part
 of
 the


growth
 of
 both.
 There's
 obviously
 a


strong
 state
 in
 both.
 In
 one
 case,
 it's


more
 of
 this
 vaunted
 Japanese


bureaucracy,
 which
 then
 turned
 out
 not


to
 be
 so
 great.
 In
 the
 other
 side,
 it's


the
 Communist
 Party
 and
 state
 banks.
 Big


trade
 surplus
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 it.
 But


there
 a
 big
 difference.
 I
 mean,
 China's


a
 lot
 bigger,
 has
 a
 way
 bigger


population.
 I
 think
 its
 political
 system


as
 you
 were
 saying
 it
 can
 kind
 of
 make


things
 happen
 and
 prevent
 things
 from


happening
 make
 really
 radical
 intrusions


in
 the
 financial
 system.
 It
 doesn't
 have


infinite
 power
 in
 that
 regard.
 I
 think


I've
 heard
 you
 guys
 discuss
 that
 on
 on


but
 I
 think
 they
 have
 definitely
 a


little
 more
 political
 economic
 firepower


than
 Japan
 has
 and
 I
 think
 part
 of
 that


is
 you
 know
 the
 strength
 of
 the


communist
 party
 as
 an
 institution
 and


the
 size
 of
 the
 population.
 It
 is


interesting
 to
 think
 like
 here
 in
 2025


we
 could
 have
 a
 conversation
 and
 be
 like


you
 know
 what
 China's
 really
 successful


because
 it
 coordinates
 its
 banks
 with


its
 manufacturers.
 They
 have
 this
 very


intense
 ideological
 grooming
 such
 that


executives
 are
 major.
 They
 believe
 in


the
 Chinese
 Communist
 National
 Project


and
 they're
 willing
 to
 sacrifice


returns.


>> Willing
 to
 sacrifice
 returns
 and
 all


these
 things.
 And
 in
 theory,
 and
 I
 don't


know
 what's
 going to
 happen,
 but
 in


theory
 in
 two
 years,
 we
 could
 go
 back


and
 say,
 oh,
 they
 had
 all
 these
 corrupt


relationships
 between
 the
 companies
 and


the
 banks.


It
 was
 all
 this
 crony
 capitalism,
 etc.


It
 is
 hard
 to
 know
 in
 real
 time
 what


factors
 are
 real
 in
 success
 because
 I
 do


find
 when
 I
 read
 stories
 about
 the


degree
 to
 which
 like
 the
 CEO
 of
 Huawei


like
 deeply
 believes
 in
 the
 CCP
 and
 the


sort
 of
 nationalist
 agenda
 like
 yeah
 wow


that's
 it's
 very
 compelling.
 I
 could
 see


how
 there's
 this
 alignment
 but
 then
 you


know
 something
 could
 happen
 in
 a
 few


years
 later
 you're
 like
 oh
 that
 was


really
 silly
 how
 they
 like
 you
 right


it's
 hard
 to
 know
 in
 real
 time.


>> Yeah
 I
 think
 that's
 absolutely
 true.
 I
 I


don't
 think
 you
 know
 we
 should
 be


complacent
 or
 but
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 an


interesting
 lesson
 of
 the
 history
 here


is
 just
 things
 can
 go
 from
 being
 common


sensical
 the
 biggest
 threat
 everybody


knows
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 they're


going
 to
 win
 everybody
 knows
 that
 they


have
 a
 better
 system
 and
 then
 a
 few


years
 later
 everyone
 is
 like
 what
 were


we
 thinking
 why
 did
 we
 think
 that
 and
 we


could
 there
 they
 had
 so
 many
 internal


problems
 that
 were
 just
 out
 of
 this
 and


that's
 kind
 of
 the
 same
 way
 with


financial
 bubbles
 bursting
 I
 guess
 you


could
 talk
 about
 these
 as
 also
 as
 like


political
 bubb
 bubbles
 is
 that


everyone's
 like,
 "Oh,
 wow.
 Look
 at
 this


big
 combine,
 this
 big
 system
 that's
 kind


of
 humming
 along
 and
 then
 things
 are


going
 on
 behind
 the
 behind
 the
 scenes


that
 are
 like,
 oh,
 there's
 an
 intrinsic


flaw
 that's
 making
 its
 way
 to
 the


surface
 and
 then
 it
 kind
 of
 manifests


itself."
 So
 George
 Soros
 gave
 a
 great


speech
 one
 time
 making
 this
 exact
 point


that
 there
 is
 a
 similarity
 between
 what


you
 he
 would
 call
 financial
 bubbles
 and


like
 political
 bubbles
 where
 you
 believe


in
 a
 system
 and
 then
 something
 emerges


that
 sort
 of
 irrevocably
 shakes
 your


confidence
 in
 the
 system.
 So
 I
 think
 I


find
 that
 analogy
 very
 compelling.


>> Yeah.
 But
 Japan
 didn't
 cease
 to
 exist.


It's
 still
 one
 of
 the
 richest
 thriving


peaceful
 prosperous.


>> It's
 not
 a
 terrible
 place
 to
 live.
 Yeah.


It's
 not
 like
 it
 went
 back
 to
 the
 stone


age.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 also
 just


very
 growth
 mindset,
 but
 it's
 still
 I


think
 has
 an
 extremely
 low
 rate
 of


unemployment,
 healthy,
 relatively


healthy
 population,
 good
 education,
 not


a
 terrible
 place
 to
 live.


>> Just
 on
 this
 point
 though,
 why
 didn't


Japan
 get
 into
 the
 sort
 of
 software
 side


of
 technology
 as
 much
 as
 it
 did
 on
 the


sort
 of
 hardware
 side
 in
 the
 80s
 and


'90s?


>> You
 know,
 I
 think
 that
 that
 is
 a


question
 I
 don't
 exactly
 know
 the
 answer


for,
 but
 that's
 often
 given
 as
 the
 big


mistake
 that
 they
 made,
 right?
 So


Japanese
 companies
 made
 an
 investment


decision
 at
 just
 the
 wrong
 time
 that


that
 hardware
 and
 I
 think
 it
 was


partially
 because
 they
 were
 always
 just


really
 good
 at
 developing
 hardware
 and


they
 had
 developed
 a
 lot
 of


institutional
 knowledge
 about
 making


devices
 and
 improving
 devices
 improving


hardware
 and
 they
 were
 like
 look
 this
 is


what
 we're
 good
 at.
 I
 also
 think
 that


there
 is
 a
 certain
 to
 not
 to
 get
 into


too
 many
 cultural
 explanation
 but
 there


is
 a
 certain
 conservatism
 in
 Japan
 about


tools
 about
 about
 devices
 and
 things


that
 are
 seen
 to
 work
 aren't
 quickly


gotten
 rid
 of.


>> The
 Japanese
 government
 just
 had
 to
 kind


of
 wage
 an
 internal
 jihad
 to
 get
 people


to
 get
 its
 own
 bureaucracy
 to
 stop
 using


floppy
 discs.
 Japanese
 companies
 still


often
 use
 fax
 machines.


>> Yes.
 As
 Tracy
 knows,


>> I
 know
 I
 used
 to
 part
 of
 my
 job
 used
 to


be
 monitoring
 a
 fax
 machine
 for
 press


releases
 and
 most
 of
 them
 that
 came
 in


were
 from
 Japan


>> and
 this
 was
 like
 the
 mid200s.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 that
 that


sense
 that
 some
 things,
 some
 ways
 of


doing
 things,
 some
 processes,
 some


technologies
 are
 good
 and
 there's
 not


any
 real
 reason
 to
 replace
 them.
 And


obviously
 like
 when
 productivity
 is
 your


number
 one
 goal
 that's
 not
 necessarily


again
 it
 may
 make
 in
 some
 way
 I
 find
 it


very
 charming
 and
 I
 find
 it
 also
 one


theory
 I've
 read
 is
 that
 the
 reason
 why


unemployment
 is
 very
 low
 is
 because


somebody
 has
 to
 be
 there
 to
 get
 those


faxes
 and
 they're
 not
 that
 Japanese


companies
 are
 not
 that
 keen
 to
 adopt


software
 that
 might
 replace
 a
 worker.
 So


there's
 a
 certain
 kind
 of
 pro-social


attitude
 and
 not
 and
 not
 doing
 these


upgrades.
 But
 yeah,
 the
 the
 transition


to
 the
 software


age
 was
 one
 of
 those
 places
 where
 Japan


is
 thought
 to
 have
 made
 a
 wrong
 turn.


>> Yeah.
 New
 Jersey,
 they
 still
 don't
 let


you
 pump
 your
 own
 gas.
 Right.
 We
 we
 have


our
 own
 cultural
 own
 cultural


dimensions.


>> New
 Jersey
 famously
 socially
 oriented.


>> That's
 right.

 Gans,

recent

 Clock
 Broke.
 Thank


you
 so
 much
 for
 uh
 coming
 on
 OddLog.


Thrilled
 that
 we
 made
 this
 happen.


>> Yeah,
 thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much,


[Music]


>> Tracy.
 That
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 fun.
 I
 do
 think


that
 Japanese
 stuff
 seemed
 really
 cool


back
 then
 in
 a
 way
 again.
 And
 maybe
 we


should
 talk
 more
 soon
 about
 the
 rise
 of


China,
 the
 brand,
 and
 whether
 there's


whether
 it
 will
 break
 through.


>> Let's
 just
 do
 the
 Laboo.


>> Yeah,
 we'll
 do
 it.
 We'll
 do
 it.
 Um


>> just
 give
 in.
 It's
 inevitable.


>> Someone
 told
 me
 that
 if
 you
 go
 to
 the
 um


the
 running
 shoe
 subreddit,


>> there's
 a
 lot
 more
 mentions
 of
 there's
 I


think
 there's
 Ant
 is
 like
 the
 Nike
 of


Japan
 that
 you
 see
 more
 mentions
 of
 them


on
 like
 I
 I
 tried
 to
 build
 a
 scraper
 of


brand
 mentions
 over
 time.
 I
 couldn't
 get


it
 done
 on
 Reddit.
 So
 I
 do
 think
 we


should
 talk
 about
 that.
 But
 you
 know


that
 was
 this
 whole
 aspect
 of
 Walkman,


Nintendo,
 those
 were
 cool
 brands
 the


whole
 time.


>> You
 know what's
 interesting
 about
 Nike


and
 China
 is
 that
 there
 was
 a
 big
 push


back
 domestically
 against
 Nike
 products


because
 of
 rising
 nationalism
 in
 China


and
 the
 idea
 that
 maybe
 Nike
 had
 made


some
 missteps
 that
 like
 offended
 policy


makers
 or
 people
 there.
 But
 no,
 overall


like
 having
 this
 conversation
 from
 2025,


given
 what
 we
 know
 about
 Japan
 today,


the
 whole
 thing
 seems
 like,
 wow,
 that's,


you
 know,
 it
 seems
 very
 surreal.


>> Seems
 very
 quaint.


>> It
 feels
 very


>> like
 this
 idea
 that
 we
 were
 really


worried
 that
 a
 relatively
 small
 island


was
 going
 to
 take
 over
 military
 that
 we


had
 a
 base
 on,
 right?
 That


>> more
 than
 one
 base,
 just
 to
 be
 clear,


>> multiple
 bases
 on
 that
 we
 were
 as


military
 related
 that
 there
 was
 that


much
 anxiety.
 a
 sort
 of
 interesting


chapter
 in
 our
 history.


>> I
 do
 think
 it's
 also
 interesting
 again


to
 think
 about
 like
 how
 much
 a
 lot
 of


the
 strengths
 and
 weaknesses
 have


flipped
 in
 perception.
 The
 idea
 that


bureaucracy
 and
 consensus
 decision


making
 was
 once
 seen
 as
 this
 competitive


advantage
 and
 now
 it's
 totally
 the


opposite.


>> I
 mean
 in
 every
 context
 right
 you
 say
 oh


one
 of
 the
 great
 things
 about
 the
 US
 we


have
 all
 these
 great
 checks
 and
 balances


etc
 and
 then
 suddenly
 we
 like
 can't


build
 anything
 or
 get
 any
 laws
 passed.


Oh,
 one
 of
 the
 big
 problems
 with
 the
 US


is
 there
 are
 so
 many
 veto
 points
 and
 you


can't
 get
 anything
 done.
 It's
 just


whatever
 the
 mood
 is
 at
 the
 time,
 the


same
 set
 of
 conditions
 will
 either
 be


get
 the
 blame
 or
 the
 credit.


>> It's
 just
 a
 giant
 pendulum
 swinging
 back


and
 forth.
 Markets
 and
 politics.


>> That's
 right.


>> All
 right.
 Shall
 we
 leave
 it
 there?
