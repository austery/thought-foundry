- This single equation spawned
four multi-trillion dollar industries
and transformed
everyone's approach to risk.
Do you think that most people
are aware of the size, scale,
utility of derivatives?
- No. No idea.
- But at its core, this
equation comes from physics,
from discovering atoms,
understanding how heat is transferred,
and how to beat the casino at blackjack.
So maybe it shouldn't be surprising
that some of the best
to beat the stock market
were not veteran traders,
but physicists, scientists,
and mathematicians.
In 1988, a mathematics
professor named Jim Simons
set up the Medallion Investment Fund,
and every year for the next 30 years,
the Medallion fund delivered
higher returns
than the market average,
and not just by a little bit,
it returned 66% per year.
At that rate of growth,
$100 invested in 1988 would be worth
$8.4 billion today.
This made Jim Simons easily the richest
mathematician of all time.
But being good at math
doesn't guarantee success
in financial markets.
Just ask Isaac Newton.
In 1720 Newton was 77 years old,
and he was rich.
He had made a lot of money working
as a professor at Cambridge for decades,
and he had a side hustle as
the Master of the Royal Mint.
His net worth was £30,000
the equivalent of $6 million today.
Now, to grow his fortune,
Newton invested in stocks.
One of his big bets was
on the South Sea Company.
Their business was shipping
enslaved Africans across the Atlantic.
Business was booming
and the share price grew rapidly.
By April of 1720, the value of
Newton's shares had doubled.
So he sold his stock.
But the stock price kept going up
and by June, Newton bought back in
and he kept buying shares
even as the price peaked.
When the price started to
fall, Newton didn't sell.
He bought more shares thinking
he was buying the dip.
But there was no rebound,
and ultimately he lost
around a third of his wealth.
When asked why he didn't see
it coming, Newton responded,
"I can calculate the motions
of the heavenly bodies,
but not the madness of people."
So what did Simons get
right that Newton got wrong?
Well, for one thing, Simons was able
to stand on the shoulders of giants.
The pioneer of using math
to model financial markets
was Louis Bachelier, born in 1870.
Both of his parents died when he was 18
and he had to take over
his father's wine business.
He sold the business a few years later
and moved to Paris to study physics,
but he needed a job to
support himself and his family
and he found one at the Bourse,
The Paris Stock Exchange.
And inside was Newton's
"madness of people"
in its rawest form.
Hundreds of traders screaming
prices, making hand signals,
and doing deals.
The thing that captured
Bachelier's interest
were contracts known as options.
The earliest known options
were bought around 600 BC
by the Greek philosopher
Thales of Miletus.
He believed that the coming
summer would yield
a bumper crop of olives.
To make money off this idea,
he could have purchased olive presses,
which if you were right,
would be in great demand,
but he didn't have enough
money to buy the machines.
So instead he went to all the
existing olive press owners
and paid them a little bit
of money to secure the option
to rent their presses in the
summer for a specified price.
When the harvest came,
Thales was right,
there were so many olives
that the price of renting
a press skyrocketed.
Thales paid the press owners
their pre-agreed price,
and then he rented out the
machines at a higher rate
and pocketed the difference.
Thales had executed the
first known call option.
A call option gives you the right,
but not the obligation to buy something
at a later date for a set price
known as the strike price.
You can also buy a put option,
which gives you the right,
but not the obligation
to sell something at a later date
for the strike price.
Put options are useful if you expect
the price to go down.
Call options are useful if
you expect the price to go up.
For example, let's say the current price
of Apple stock is a hundred dollars,
but you expect it to go up.
You could buy a call option for $10
that gives you the right,
but not the obligation
to buy Apple stock in one
year for a hundred dollars.
That is the strike price.
Just a little side note,
American options can be exercised
on any date up to the expiry,
whereas European options
must be exercised on
the expiry date.
To keep things simple, we'll
stick to European options.
So if in a year the price of Apple stock
has gone up to $130,
you can use the option to buy shares
for a hundred dollars and
then immediately sell them
for $130.
After you take into
account the $10 you paid
for the option, you've made a $20 profit.
Alternatively, if in a year
the stock prices dropped to $70,
you just wouldn't use the option
and you've lost the $10 you paid for it.
So the profit and loss
diagram looks like this.
If the stock price ends up
below the strike price,
you lose what you paid for the option.
But if the stock price is
higher than the strike price,
then you earn that difference
minus the cost of the option.
There are at least three
advantages of options.
One is that it limits your downside.
If you had bought the
stock instead of the option
and it went down to $70,
you would've lost $30.
And in theory, you could
have lost a hundred if the
stock went to zero.
The second benefit is
options provide leverage.
If you had bought the stock
and it went up to $130,
then your investment grew by 30%.
But if you had bought
the option, you only had
to put up $10.
So your profit of $20 is actually
a 200% return on investment.
On the downside, if you
had owned the stock,
your investment would've
only dropped by 30%,
whereas with the option you lose all 100%.
So with options trading, there's a chance
to make much larger profits,
but also much bigger losses.
The third benefit is you
can use options as a hedge.
- I think the original
motivation for options
was to figure out a way to reduce risk.
And then of course, once people decided
they wanted to buy insurance,
that meant that there are
other people out there
that wanted to sell it
or a profit, and that's
how markets get created.
- So options can be
an incredibly useful investing tool,
but what Bachelier saw on the
trading floor was chaos,
especially when it came to
the price of stock options.
Even though they had been
around for hundreds of years,
no one had found a good way to price them.
Traders would just bargain
to come to an agreement
about what the price should be.
- Given the option to buy or
sell something in the future,
it seems like a very
amorphous kind of a trade.
And so coming up with prices
for these rather strange
objects has been a challenge
that's plagued a number of economists
and business people for centuries.
- Now, Bachelier, already
interested in probability,
thought there had to be
a mathematical solution
to this problem, and he
proposed this as his PhD topic
to his advisor Henri Poincaré.
Looking into the math of finance
wasn't really something
people did back then,
but to Bachelier's
surprise, Poincaré agreed.
To accurately price an option,
first you need to know what happens
to stock prices over time.
The price of a stock is
basically set by a tug of war
between buyers and sellers.
When more people wanna buy
a stock, the price goes up.
When more people wanna sell
a stock, the price goes down.
But the number of buyers and sellers
can be influenced by almost anything,
like the weather, politics,
new competitors, innovation and so on.
So Bachelier realized that
it's virtually impossible
to predict all these factors accurately.
So the best you can do is assume
that at any point in time the stock price
is just as likely to go up as down
and therefore over the long term,
stock prices follow a
random walk,
moving up and down as if their
next move is determined
by the flip of a coin.
- Randomness is a hallmark
of an efficient market.
By efficient economists typically mean
that you can't make money by trading.
- The idea that you shouldn't
be able to buy an asset
and sell it immediately
for a profit is known
as the Efficient Market Hypothesis.
- The more people try to make money
by predicting the stock market
and then trading on those predictions,
the less predictable those prices are.
If you and I could predict
the stock market tomorrow,
then we would do it.
We would start trading today on stocks
that we thought were gonna go up tomorrow.
Well, if we did that, then
instead of going up tomorrow,
they would go up now
as we bought more and more of the stock.
So the very act of predicting
actually affects the quality
of the future outcomes.
And so in a totally efficient market,
the prices tomorrow
can't possibly have any
predictive power.
If they did, we would've
taken advantage of it today.
- This is a galton board.
It's got rows of pegs
arranged in a triangle
and around 6,000 tiny ball bearings
that I can pour through the pegs.
Now, each time a ball hits a peg,
there's a 50 50 chance it
goes to the left or the right.
So each ball follows a
random walk as it passes
through these pegs,
which makes it basically impossible
to predict the path of
any individual ball.
But if I flip this over,
what you can see
is that all the balls together
always create a predictable pattern.
That is a collection of random walks
creates a normal distribution.
It's centered around the middle
because the number of
paths a ball could take
to get here is the greatest.
And the further out you go,
the fewer the paths a ball
could take to get there.
Like if you want to end up
here, well the ball would have
to go left, left, left,
left all the way down.
So there's only one way to get here,
but to get into the middle,
there are thousands of paths
that a ball could take.
Now, Bachelier believed a stock price is
just like a ball going
through a galton board.
Each additional layer of
pegs represents a time step.
So after a short time, the
stock price could only move
up or down a little,
but after more time, a wider
range of prices is possible.
According to Bachelier the
expected future price
of a stock is described
by a normal distribution,
centered on the current price
which spreads out over time.
Bachelier realized he had rediscovered
the exact equation which describes
how heat radiates from
regions of high temperature
to regions of low temperature.
This was first discovered
by Joseph Fourier back in 1822.
So Bachelier called his discovery
the radiation of probabilities.
Since he was writing about finance,
the physics community
didn't take any notice,
but the mathematics of the
random walk would go on
to solve an almost century
old mystery in physics.
In 1827,
Scottish botanist Robert Brown
was looking at pollen grains
under the microscope,
and he noticed that the particles
suspended in water on the microscope slide
were moving around randomly.
Because he didn't know
whether it was something to do
with the pollen being living material,
He tested non-organic particles
such as dust from lava and meteorite rock.
Again, he saw them moving
around in the same way.
So Brown discovered that any particles,
if they were small enough,
exhibited this random movement,
which came to be known as Brownian motion.
But what caused it remained a mystery.
80 years later in 1905,
Einstein figured out the answer.
Over the previous couple hundred years,
the idea that gases and liquids
were made up of molecules
became more and more popular.
But not everyone was convinced
that molecules were real
in a physical sense.
Just that the theory explained
a lot of observations.
The idea led Einstein to hypothesize
that Brownian motion is caused by
the trillions of molecules
hitting the particle
from every direction, every instant.
Occasionally, more will hit
from one side than the other,
and the particle will momentarily jump.
To derive the mathematics,
Einstein supposed that as
an observer we can't see
or predict these collisions
with any certainty.
So at any time we have to
assume that the particle
is just as likely to move
in one direction as an another.
So just like stock prices,
microscopic particles move
like a ball falling down a galton board,
the expected location of
a particle is described
by a normal distribution,
which broadens with time.
It's why even in completely still water,
microscopic particles spread out.
This is diffusion.
By solving the Brownian motion mystery.
Einstein had found definitive evidence
that atoms and molecules exist.
Of course, he had no idea
that Bachelier had
uncovered the random walk
five years earlier.
By the time Bachelier finished his PhD,
he had finally figured
out a mathematical way
to price an option.
Remember that with a call option,
if the future price of a stock
is less than the strike price,
then you lose the premium
paid for the option.
But if the stock price is
greater than the strike price,
you pocket that difference
and you make a net profit
if the stock has gone up
by more than you paid for the option.
So the probability that an option buyer
makes a profit is the
probability that the price
increases by more than
the price paid for it,
which is the green shaded area.
And the probability that
the seller makes money
is just the probability that
the price stays low enough
that the buyer doesn't earn
more than they paid for it.
This is the red shaded
area.
Multiplying the profit or loss
by the probability of each outcome,
Bachelier calculated the
expected return of an option.
Now how much should it cost?
If the price of an option is too high,
no one will wanna buy it.
Conversely, if the price is too low,
everyone will want to buy it.
Bachelier argued that the fair price
is what makes the expected return
for buyers and sellers equal.
Both parties should stand to
gain or lose the same amount.
That was Bachelier's insight
into how to accurately price an option.
When Bachelier finished his
thesis, he had beaten Einstein
to inventing the random walk
and solved the problem that
had eluded options traders
for hundreds of years.
But no one noticed.
The physicists were uninterested
and traders weren't ready.
The key thing missing was a
way to make a ton of money.
Hey, so I'm not sure how
stock traders sleep at night
with billions of dollars
riding on the madness of people,
but I have been sleeping just
fine, thanks to the sponsor
of this video, Eight Sleep.
I've recently moved to Australia
and it has been really hot,
but I've been keeping
cool at night using the
Eight Sleep Pod.
It's a smart mattress cover
that can control the
temperature of the bed
and track how well you sleep.
You can set the temperature
to whatever you like
from around 13 degrees Celsius,
all the way up to 43 degrees Celsius,
and my wife likes it a
little warmer than I do,
so it's useful that we can each have
our own temperature on
our own side of the bed.
And if you don't know
what works best for you,
well the Pod will learn
your ideal temperature
and optimize it throughout
the night using its autopilot.
And usually that means getting
a couple of degrees cooler
during the start of the night
and then warming up in the morning
to help you wake up.
You can also have it wake
you with a slight vibration,
which is really pleasant
and it doesn't disturb your partner
like an annoying phone sound.
You know, I've been
tracking my sleep before
and after using the Pod,
and I've found that I've
been sleeping longer
and waking up less since using the Pod.
So if you wanna try it out for yourself,
click on the link in the description
and thanks again to Eight Sleep
for sponsoring this part of the video.
In the 1950s,
a young physics graduate, Ed
Thorpe,
was doing his PhD in Los Angeles,
but a few hours drive away,
Las Vegas was quickly becoming
the gambling capital of the world,
and Thorpe saw a way to make a fortune.
He headed to Vegas and sat
down at the blackjack table,
back then, the dealer only
used a single deck of cards,
so Thorpe could keep a
mental note of all the cards
that had been played as he saw them.
This allowed him to work out
if he had an advantage.
He would bet a bigger portion of his funds
when the odds were in his favor
and less when they weren't.
He had invented card counting.
This is a remarkable innovation,
considering blackjack had been around
in various forms for hundreds of years,
and for a while this
made him a lot of money.
But the casinos got wise to his strategy
and they added more decks
of cards to the game
to reduce the benefit of card counting.
So Thorpe took his winnings to
what he called the
biggest casino on Earth:
the stock market.
He started a hedge fund that would go on
to make a 20% return every year
for 20 years,
the best performance
ever seen at that time.
And he did it by transferring
the skills he honed
at the blackjack table
to the stock market.
Thorpe pioneered a type of hedging,
a way to protect against
losses with balancing
or compensating transactions.
- Thorpe did it mathematically.
He looked at the odds
of winning and losing
and decided that under certain
conditions you can actually
tilt the odds in your favor
by using certain patterns
to be able to make bets.
- Suppose Bob sells Alice
a call option on a stock,
and let's say the stock has gone up,
so now it's in the money for Alice.
Well now for every additional
$1, the stock price goes up,
Bob will lose $1,
but he can eliminate this risk
by owning one unit of stock.
Then if the price goes up, he
would lose $1 from the option
but gain that dollar back from the stock.
And if the stock drops back
outta the money for Alice,
he sells the stock
so he doesn't risk losing
any money from that either.
This is called dynamic hedging.
It means Bob can make a profit
with minimal risk from
fluctuating stock prices.
A hedge portfolio pi at any one time
will offset the option V
with some amount of stock delta.
- It basically means I
can sell you something
without having to take the
opposite side of the trade.
And the way to think about it is
I have synthetically manufactured
an option for you.
I've created it out of nothing
by doing dynamic trading. Dynamic hedging.
- As we saw with Bob's
example delta,
the amount of stock he has to hold,
changes depending on current prices.
Mathematically, it represents
how much the current option price changes
with a change in the stock price.
But Thorpe wasn't satisfied
with Bachelier's model
for pricing options.
I mean, for one thing, stock
prices aren't entirely random.
They can increase over time
if the business is doing well
or fall if it isn't.
Bachelier's model ignored this.
So Thorpe came up with
a more accurate model
for pricing options, which
took this drift into account.
- I actually figured out
what this model was back in
the middle of 1967,
and I decided that I would
just use it for myself
and then later I kept it
quiet for my own investors.
The idea was to basically make a lot
of money out of it for everybody.
- His strategy was if the
option was going cheap,
according to his model, buy it.
If it was overvalued, short sell it,
that is bet against it.
And that way, more often than not,
he would end up on the
winning side of the trade.
This lasted until 1973.
In that year, Fischer Black
and Myron Scholes came up with an equation
that changed the industry.
Robert Merton independently
published his own version,
which was based on the mathematics
of stochastic calculus,
so he is also credited.
- I thought I'd have the field to myself,
but unfortunately, Fischer Black
and Myron Scholes published the idea
and they did a better job
of the model than I did
because they had very tight mathematics
behind their derivation
- Like Bachelier,
they thought that option
prices should offer a fair bet
to both buyers and sellers,
but their approach was totally new.
They said if it was possible
to construct a risk-free
portfolio of options
and stocks just like Thorpe was doing
with his delta hedging,
then in an efficient market,
a fair market, this portfolio
should return nothing more
than the risk-free rate,
what the same money would earn if invested
in the safest asset, US treasury bonds.
The assumption was that
if you're not taking on
any additional risk, then
it shouldn't be possible
to receive any extra returns.
To describe how stock
prices change over time,
Black, Scholes, and Merton
used an improved version
of Bachelier's model just like Thorpe.
This says that at any time
we expect the stock price
to move randomly,
plus a general trend
up or down, the drift.
By combining these two equations,
Black, Scholes, and Merton
came up with the most
famous equation in finance.
It relates the price of any
kind of contract to any asset,
stocks, bonds, you name it.
The same year they
published this equation,
the Chicago Board Options
Exchange was founded.
Why is that equation so important?
Like for finance, how
did that change the game?
- Well, because when you solve
that partial differential equation,
you get an explicit formula
of the price of the option
as a function of a bunch
of these input parameters.
And for the very first time,
you now have an explicit expression
where you plug in the parameters
and out pops this number
so that people can actually
use it to trade on.
- This led to one of the
fastest adoptions by industry
of an academic idea in all
of the social sciences.
- Within just a couple of years,
the Black Scholes formula was
adopted as the benchmark
for Wall Street for trading options.
The exchange traded
options market has exploded
and it's now a multi-trillion
dollar industry,
the volume in this
market has been doubling
roughly every five years.
So this is the financial
equivalent of Moore's Law.
There are other businesses
that have grown just as quickly,
like credit default swaps market,
the OTC derivatives market,
the securitized debt market.
All of these are multi-trillion
dollar industries
that in one form
or another make use of the idea
of Black Scholes Merton option pricing.
- This opened up a whole new
way to hedge against anything,
and not just for hedge funds.
Nowadays, pretty much every
large company, governments,
and even individual investors use options
to hedge against their own specific risks.
Suppose you're running an airline
and you're worried that an
increase in oil prices
would eat into your profits.
Well, using the Black
Scholes Merton equation,
there's a way to accurately
and efficiently hedge that risk.
You price an option to
buy something that tracks
the price of oil, and
that option will pay off
if oil prices go up,
and that will help compensate
you for the higher cost
of fuel you have to pay.
So Black Scholes Merton
can help reduce risk,
but it can also provide leverage.
- An ongoing battle
between bullish day traders
and hedge fund short sellers
that have bet against the stock,
GameStop shares, have now risen some 700%.
- Well, GameStop is a
really interesting example
for all sorts of reasons,
but options figured
prominently in that example
because a small cadre of users
on this Reddit sub-channel
r/wallstreetbets
decided that the hedge fund managers
that were shorting the stock
and betting that the company
would go out of business
needed to be punished.
And so they bought
shares of GameStop stock
to try to drive up price.
Turns out that buying
the stock was not enough,
because with a dollar's worth of cash,
you can buy a dollar's worth of stock,
but with a dollar's worth
of cash, you can buy options
that affected many more than
a dollar's worth of stock,
perhaps in some cases $10
or $20 worth of stock for a
dollar's worth of options.
And so there's natural leverage embedded
in these securities.
And so the combination
of buying both the stock
and the options caused the
prices to rise very quickly.
And what that did was to cause
these hedge fund managers
to lose a lot of money quickly.
- How big is this market for derivatives?
How big is this whole area that kind of
comes out of Black Scholes Merton?
- There are estimates of how
large derivatives markets are,
and first, let's be clear
what a derivative is.
A derivative is a financial
security whose value derived
from another financial security.
So an option is an
example of a derivative.
In general, the size of
derivative markets globally
is the on the order
of several hundred trillion dollars.
- How does that compare to the size
of the underlying
securities they're based on?
- It's multiples of the
underlying securities.
- I just have to interrupt
because it seems kind of crazy
that you have more money
riding on the things
that are based on the thing
than the thing itself.
- That's right.
- So tell me how that makes any sense.
- Because what options allow you to do is
to take the underlying thing
and turn it into 5, 10, 20, 50 things.
So these pieces of paper
that we call options and derivatives,
they basically allow us to create many,
many different versions of
the underlying asset,
versions that individuals
find more palatable
because of their own
risk reward preferences.
- Does this make the markets
and the global economy more stable,
or less stable, or no effect?
- All three. So it turns out
that during normal times,
these markets are a very
significant source of liquidity
and therefore stability.
During abnormal times,
by that I mean when there are
periods of market stress,
all of these securities
can go in one direction,
typically down,
and when they go down together,
that creates a really big market crash.
So in those circumstances,
derivatives markets can
exacerbate these kinds
of market dislocations.
- In 1997, Merton
and Scholes were awarded the
Nobel Prize in economics.
Black was acknowledged
for his contributions,
but unfortunately he had passed away
just two years earlier.
- We were gonna make a
lot of money in options,
but now Black and Shoals
have told everybody
what the secret is.
- With the option pricing formula now out
for everyone to see
hedge funds would need
to discover better ways
to find market inefficiencies.
Enter Jim Simons.
Before Simons had any
exposure to the stock market,
he was a mathematician.
His work on Riemann geometry
was instrumental in many areas
of mathematics and physics,
including knot theory,
quantum field theory, and
quantum computing
Chern Simon's theory laid the
mathematical foundation
for string theory.
In 1976,
the American Mathematical
Society presented him
with the Oswald Veblen Prize in geometry.
But at the top of his academic
career, Simons went looking
for a new challenge.
When he founded Renaissance
Technologies in 1978,
his strategy was to use machine learning
to find patterns in the stock market.
Patterns provide
opportunities to make money.
- The real thing was to gather
a tremendous amount of data
and we had to get it by
hand in the early days,
we went down to the Federal Reserve
and copied interest rate
histories and stuff like that
'cause it didn't exist on computers.
- His rationale was that the
market is far too complex
for anyone to be able to make
predictions with certainty.
But Simons had worked for
the US Institute for Defense Analysis
during the Cold War,
breaking Russian codes
by extracting patterns
from masses of data.
Simons was convinced
that a similar approach
could beat the market.
He then used his academic
contacts to hire a bunch
of the best scientists he could find.
- What was your employment criteria then?
If they knew nothing about finance,
what were you looking for in them?
Someone with a PhD in physics
and who'd had five years out
and had written a few good papers
and was obviously a
smart guy or in astronomy
or in mathematics or in statistics.
Someone who had done
science and done it well.
- It's not surprising that mathematicians
and physicists are involved in this field.
First of all, finance pays a
lot better than, you know,
being an assistant
professor of mathematics.
And for a number of
mathematicians, the beauty
of option pricing is equally
compelling to anything else
that they're doing in their professions.
- One of these was Leonard Baum, a pioneer
of Hidden Markov models.
Just as Einstein realized that
although we can't directly observe atoms,
we can infer their existence
through their effect on pollen grains,
Hidden Markov models aim to find factors
that are not directly observable,
but do have an effect
on what we can observe.
And soon after that,
Renaissance launched their now-famous
Medallion fund.
Using hidden Markov models
and other data driven strategies,
The Medallion fund became
the highest returning
investment fund of all time.
This led Bradford Cornell
of UCLA, in his paper
Medallion Fund: The
Ultimate Counterexample?
to conclude that maybe the
efficient market hypothesis
itself is wrong.
- In 1988, I published a paper testing it,
the US Stock Market,
and what I found was that
the hypothesis is false.
You can actually reject
the hypothesis in the data.
And so there are predictabilities
in the stock market.
- So it's possible to beat the
market is what you're saying.
- It's possible to beat the
market if you have
the right models, the right training,
the resources, the computational power,
and so on and so forth, yes.
- The people who have found the patterns
in the stock market,
and the randomness for that matter,
have often been physicists
and mathematicians,
but their impact has gone
beyond just making them rich.
By modeling market dynamics,
they've provided new insight into risk
and opened up whole new markets.
They've determined what the accurate price
of derivatives should be,
and in doing so,
they have helped eliminate
market inefficiencies.
Ironically, if we are ever able
to discover all the patterns
in the stock market,
knowing what they are will
allow us to eliminate them.
Then we will finally have
a perfectly efficient market
where all price movements
are truly random.
