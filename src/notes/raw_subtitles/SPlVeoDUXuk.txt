Hello everyone, I'm Anthony
Welcome to my channel
Today's video
I want to continue chatting with you all
How to make AI better assist us in learning and thinking
In the video on May 18th
We explored the potential of AI for self-discovery
At that time we said
You can write a diary by talking to AI
Share your emotions and thoughts
Compared with traditional diary writing
This can be said to be a huge breakthrough
We can also request
AI reads a psychology or philosophy book
Let’s analyze our experience
After the show was released
Many friends want me to share more
Lessons on how to use AI to learn
So today we will mainly discuss
How to combine Python and AI
Make it our priority when reading humanities and social science books
A truly useful assistant
We will also have a set of exam questions
Test the two current mainstream AI
That is, ChatGPT 5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro
Differences in ability when reading humanities and social science books
So everyone should follow Anthony's channel
Not only can we see the views and interpretations of humanities and social sciences
You can also watch technical videos
You can also see the combination of the two
Isn’t it very worthwhile and cost-effective?
alright
That's the end of the bragging part
I will post this video
Put it in the list of "Psychology and Education"
If you have anything you want to discuss with me
and consultation topics
You can contact my email to make an appointment
So let's get back to today's topic
First of all, I have always wanted AI to be such an ideal academic assistant
It can be read in full
The humanities and social science books I provide
And according to my needs
In different literature
Perform cross-comparison and theoretical transfer
For example, I uploaded Foucault's "Discipline and Punish"
and George Orwell's novel 1984
I hope AI can use Foucault's perspective
To analyze and explain the novel
The social structure of Oceania
For example
I hope AI can read Plato's Republic
and Kant's Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals
Abstract the concept of "justice" from them
And answer some of my current confusion and questions
For example
I can also upload a thinker to the AI
一生中的十本主要著作
and a psychology book
Ask AI to use the insights from this psychology book
Analyze the theoretical evolution path of this thinker
We can also come up with many combinations
These combinations are completely tailored to meet our needs
Such as curiosity
Or a real problem that needs to be solved
And every one of these
can become a very meaningful academic topic
These combinations often involve interdisciplinary transfer
In the past few videos we have talked about learning
I repeatedly emphasized
This kind of free exploration according to one's own interests
The best way to learn
The so-called disciplinary division
It is just a classification standard to facilitate research and teaching
It is essentially an artificial, external framework
While it can help us define and understand the problem
But it does not mean that human cognition and learning
This division must be strictly followed
The learning process
It is a continuous emotional and cognitive experience
A person is interested in biology in the morning
Think about physics in the afternoon
Thinking about economics at night
This messy exploration
In fact, it is the most consistent with the characteristics of human thinking.
Because our cognition is inherently associative
Rather than linear division
In this chaotic and unsystematic
Individuals have accumulated a wealth of feelings
His emotional cognition is continuous.
This is the most essential thing
We say any learning
No matter how systematic his course system is
Ultimately, it still depends on the learners themselves
Continuity of thoughts and emotions
However
When we want to read a lot of books across fields
The cost of reading is very high
Many books on humanities and social sciences
They all start with hundreds of thousands of words
If it spans multiple disciplines
The amount of information is astonishing
We know
Many books on humanities and social sciences
There may not be clear chapter markings
Loose structure
Difficult to quickly search and locate by keywords
Moreover, the logic of humanities and social sciences is different from that of natural sciences.
The author's writing is often full of metaphors.
Reflection, interpretation and questioning
Its meaning is often hidden in a long text
and
Almost all of them involve knowledge from other disciplines
In traditional academic work
To achieve this free transfer and application across disciplines
Requires researchers to read a lot of books for a long time
You also need to create notes for cross-comparison
If you are reading foreign language literature
Involving language differences or historical background
It's even more difficult
Therefore, if we use the traditional method
To achieve this freedom of reading and thinking
Not only does it require a person to have a very high memory
and abstract thinking skills
It also requires years of accumulation
and a large team of consultants
AI can
Read through hundreds of thousands of words of text
And abstract related theories
And be able to respond to our questions around these topics
Any thoughts and questions raised
This is a speed and efficiency that traditional methods cannot achieve
But this idea faces some practical difficulties.
The first difficulty is
A large number of humanities and social science e-books are based on
A photocopy of the PDF
If you upload these files directly
Then AI will call OCR
Optical Character Recognition
To identify the text
and convert it into text
But this process is invisible to us.
We don't know what it recognized as.
This process is also inefficient.
AI will be much slower in processing
If the recognition is not clean and complete
AI may also pretend to understand when asking questions
However, currently on the market
There is a lack of free and powerful OCR tools
The second difficulty is
How do we determine whether an AI has truly finished reading?
And understood a text of hundreds of thousands of words?
Sometimes, when we ask AI questions
It may first retrieve the corresponding text and then answer
Rather than conducting a global analysis
This requires us to design a set of test questions
Propose some cross-section
Problems involving complex logical chains
To verify whether it has been read
OK
So let’s solve the first problem first.
That is, how to convert audio and video PDF books
Convert to plain text
That is, plain text format
We know
OCR scanned text often has chaotic layout
Recognition error, no segmentation, crowded together
Looks messy
There is no reading experience at all.
But this text is for AI to read
It's not for us to read.
As long as the text is correct, it's fine.
This is actually an ideal input format for AI.
We can program
To complete this work in batches
AI can definitely help us here
Taking ChatGPT as an example
We can let ChatGPT generate a piece of code
Requires calling the command line tool OCR my pdf
Recognize text in PDF
And save it in txt format
We also need to create a folder
Request the program
Can automatically identify all PDFs in the folder
And tell CHATGPT the path to the file
Here I created a folder called book
Then put the PDF of "Imagined Communities" in it
CHATGPT gives us a piece of code
Let's copy and paste it into the editor
And save it to this folder
Then click Run
After the recognition is completed
We see that the txt file appears
When you open it, you will find that there are not many words that are recognized incorrectly.
This may be because this PDF is relatively clear.
But we will find
Page numbers, dividing lines, and book titles will be repeated
Another example is too many spaces between words.
There are also many errors in paragraphing and punctuation.
These are important for AI reading
It's all meaningless interference
And we know
The scale of text processing by AI at one time
There is also a limit
For example, CHATGPT
It is to decompose natural language into multiple tokens
That is, the basic unit for processing and generating text
And the fee is calculated based on the number of tokens
So we can let CHATGPT
Add the cleaning function to this code
For example, ask it to delete duplicate page numbers,
Headers, footers, dividing lines, etc.
Purify the generated text
Then let's run this code again
The text after cleaning
It will look much cleaner
Although there are certainly still some identification errors
But it is unavoidable
And it also happens to test the ability of AI
A powerful model
Should be used when processing dirty text
Still able to extract as accurate information as possible
This is a very practical ability in itself.
As good scholars
Able to read damaged books
Still able to restore the overall logic of the text
When we have finished making the text
Now we can move on to the most important part
That is, comparing the capabilities of two AI models
The two players participating in the comparison
They are CHATGPT 5 who have opened plus membership
and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro
Both AIs are priced at $20 per month
Both support large text reading
However, on the surface data
GPT is lagging behind Gemini
GPT supports a context window of up to 128K tokens
There is also a claim of 250,000 tokens
But they are still behind Gemini’s 1 million tokens
So what is the actual performance?
We will know the answer next
but
A while ago, a friend told me a piece of news.
In June this year, Google released Gemini CLI
That is, a command line tool
This allows us to
Calling the Gemini 2.5 Pro model
Google generously gave us 60 requests per minute.
And a free quota of 1000 requests per day
For most users, this
It's totally sufficient
Installing Gemini CLI on your computer is easy
You can search
Because I use a MacBook
I'll take my computer as an example.
First we need to install Homebrew in the Terminal
Then install Gemini CLI with Homebrew
First time login
You need to obtain authorization from your Google account
After all this is done
We can see the interface of Gemini CLI
The following line means
It uses the 2.5 Pro model
and its remaining context length
Get here
We finally got all the tools ready.
How to design a set of test questions
To identify the reading ability of these two AIs
We are here
First, let’s take the book “Attachment in Psychotherapy” as an example.
To maintain objectivity
I think
A reasonable difficulty gradient should be set for the questions
The most basic step is fact extraction
For example, a question like this
Psychologist Bowlby
How is the task of a psychotherapist defined?
This part
Mainly examine whether AI can locate the original information
and whether they can quote and paraphrase accurately
Will it be fabricated?
These questions can be found directly in the original text of the book.
The second part is the directory summary
For example, we ask AI to summarize the table of contents of the entire book
Summarize the content of each chapter in one sentence
This can examine AI's understanding of the structure of the entire book.
AI not only needs to fully extract the chapter titles
It should also be able to reasonably compress lengthy texts
And summarize the theme
The third stage is more difficult
We hope that AI can not only understand text
It also needs to be able to abstract the implicit logical structure
for example
There is a passage in attachment in psychotherapy:
Main (1991) emphasizes the ability of metacognition
Thinking about ideas
This is based on the distinction between the surface and the essence of cognition.
(i.e. things may not be what they appear to be)
Representational diversity and representational change
On the basis of
Then we can ask the AI:
Please analyze the three foundations of metacognitive ability mentioned in this book
In the original text
The three foundations of metacognition are not directly mentioned.
But grammatically and logically
These three concepts are indeed parallel
Belong to the same category
This requires AI to be able to correctly identify the category of abstract concepts
It has to summarize a set of structures
But you can't make up content that has no basis
At the same time, due to the concept of metacognition
In fact, it is mentioned repeatedly throughout the book.
This is even more challenging
A model
Is it possible to call all relevant parts?
as well as
Can you distinguish which sentences are essential statements?
Which sentences just revolve around this concept
Expand and derive
The fourth step is to examine the application of theories across chapters
This is also the most practical layer
For example, we can ask
Please base on the three foundations of metacognition in this book.
Analyze the specific psychological characteristics of indifferent attachment in these three dimensions
The concepts of metacognition and indifferent attachment
Distributed across two very large chapters
Therefore, AI must first abstract
Three basic concepts of metacognition
Then
Apply this concept to the following analysis
This requires AI to be able to apply theories to different scenarios
Rather than mechanically reciting
Ability to apply abstract theories to analyze specific cases
This can be said to be the case in humanities and social science research.
The most practical and valuable skill
To sum up
In today's video
We discussed our expectations for AI's reading abilities
And the significance of conducting such a test
Next
We can now officially enter the competition phase
