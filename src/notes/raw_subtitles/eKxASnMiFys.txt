Maria
 Karina
 Machado,
 welcome
 to
 the


all-in
 interview
 and
 thank
 you
 for
 being


here
 with
 me
 today
 and
 congratulations


on
 winning
 the
 Nobel
 Peace
 Prize
 two


weeks
 ago.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much,
 David.
 It's
 my


pleasure.


>> Today,
 you
 are
 in
 hiding.
 In
 October
 of


2023,
 you
 won
 the
 presidential
 primary


election
 in
 Venezuela.
 Last
 March,
 you


were
 disqualified
 from
 running
 in
 the


general
 election.
 You
 appointed


ultimately
 a
 surrogate
 Edmundo
 Gonzalez.


After
 the
 vote
 for
 the
 general
 election


for
 the
 presidency,
 your
 party
 presented


evidence
 that
 claimed
 that
 you
 had
 won


69
 12%
 of
 the
 votes
 while
 Maduro
 through


the
 National
 Electoral
 Council
 declared


that
 he
 was
 the
 winner
 with
 51%
 of
 the


votes.
 This
 is
 the
 recap
 of
 a
 very
 long


story
 of
 the
 Maduro
 regime
 and
 prior
 to


that
 the
 Chavez
 regime
 and
 its
 effect
 on


the
 people
 of
 Venezuela
 which
 you
 have


tried
 to
 bring
 to
 light
 on
 the
 global


stage.
 I
 was
 hoping
 to
 frame
 up
 the


story
 for
 our
 audience
 who
 may
 not
 know


the
 history
 of
 Venezuela
 very
 well
 by


talking
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the


background
 of
 the
 country
 and
 how
 your


childhood
 and
 your
 youth
 brought
 you
 to


the
 stage
 that
 you're
 on
 today
 and
 just


to
 provide
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 background


and
 forgive
 me
 for
 my
 lengthy


introduction
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 important


for
 folks
 to
 understand
 that
 the


discovery
 of
 oil


>> in
 Venezuela
 in
 1914
 began
 an
 economic


boom
 that
 really
 kicked
 off
 in
 1922.


Today,
 Venezuela
 has
 proven
 oil
 reserves


of
 300
 billion
 barrels,
 the
 number
 one


proven
 oil
 reserve
 in
 the
 world.
 Saudi


Arabia
 is
 number
 two
 at
 266
 billion
 and


the
 US
 is
 at
 48
 billion.
 Over
 the


decades
 that
 followed
 the
 discovery
 of


oil
 in
 Venezuela,
 there
 was
 initially
 an


improvement
 in
 the
 economy
 through
 the


investment
 by
 the
 seven
 sisters
 which


are
 a
 group
 of
 seven
 oil
 companies
 and


ultimately
 there
 was
 a
 transition
 in
 the


country
 to
 nationalize
 oil
 production


and
 that
 led
 to
 I
 think
 the
 story
 that


brings
 us
 here
 today.
 So
 Maria
 Karina


again
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Maybe


you
 could
 tell
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 about


your
 youth.


Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 have
 to
 thank
 you


>> because
 this
 is
 a
 unique
 decisive
 moment


in
 Venezuela.
 We've
 been
 under
 this


tyranny
 that
 has
 turned
 into
 a
 real


criminal
 structure
 for
 26
 years
 that


have
 turned,
 you
 know,
 what
 used
 to
 be


one
 of
 the
 freest
 and
 richest
 countries


in
 the
 Americas
 into
 one
 of
 the
 poorest


and
 with
 a
 third
 of
 our
 population


forced
 to
 flee.
 So
 imagine
 what
 a


tragedy
 it
 shows
 that
 you
 know
 you
 can


have
 huge
 unique
 natural
 endowments
 but


if
 but
 that's
 not
 uh
 wealth
 you
 need


talent
 you
 need
 institutions
 and
 you


need
 freedom
 in
 order
 to
 turn
 that
 in


the
 well-being
 of
 your
 people
 I
 I
 was


born
 in
 an
 incredible
 family
 I
 I
 I
 thank


the
 Lord
 because
 um
 we
 have
 a
 huge


family
 like
 Latin
 American
 family
 like


to
 be
 you
 together
 hanging
 around
 all


the
 time.
 My
 father
 was
 an
 incredible


industrial


uh
 entrepreneur.


He
 he
 is
 perhaps
 the
 smartest
 and
 most


generous
 and
 honest
 individuals
 I've
 met


in
 my
 life.
 And
 and
 he
 taught
 us
 the


responsibility
 that
 comes
 with
 with
 that


with
 your
 family
 values
 and
 the


opportunity
 life
 gives
 you.
 And
 uh


that's
 why
 we
 I
 only
 imagined
 my
 life
 in


Venezuela
 and
 in
 freedom
 and
 and
 and
 we


grew
 with
 that
 sense
 of
 responsibility.


And
 uh
 but
 to
 be
 honest,
 I'm
 part
 of
 a


generation
 that,
 you
 know,
 look
 politics


with,
 you
 know,
 rejection
 or
 even


contempt.
 I
 I
 said
 I
 would
 do
 anything


in
 my
 life
 but
 politics.
 and
 um
 and
 and


and and
 you
 know
 thought
 we
 thought
 that


we
 had
 inherited
 democracy
 forever.
 We


took
 it
 for
 granted
 and
 uh
 when
 Chavez


arrived
 our
 lives
 were
 you
 know
 turned


over
 and
 we
 realized
 that
 we
 we
 need
 to


exercise
 citizenship
 if
 we
 wanted
 to


live
 with
 freedom
 and
 that's
 how
 it
 all


started.
 I
 never
 thought
 I
 would
 be


sitting
 here
 with
 you
 talking
 about


politics
 or
 democracy.


>> I
 never
 thought
 I
 would
 be
 sitting
 on
 a


podcast,
 but
 uh
 you
 know,
 life
 takes
 us


down
 strange
 paths.
 What
 were
 the


conditions
 in
 the
 country
 when
 Chavez


came
 to
 power?
 What
 sort
 of
 life
 were


you
 living?
 What
 were
 you
 seeing
 in
 the


country
 that
 enabled
 Chavez
 to
 come
 to


power?
 And
 what
 did
 he
 promise
 the


people?
 Look,
 we
 had
 a
 period
 of
 of
 uh


democracy
 that
 that
 brought
 Venezuela


huge
 opportunities,
 you
 know,
 that
 uh


widespread
 education
 and
 health.


Unfortunately,


uh
 we
 stopped
 short
 of
 a
 a
 real
 free


economy.
 But
 um
 the
 state
 control
 not


only
 of
 institutions
 but
 as
 you


mentioned
 when
 the
 oil
 companies
 were


you
 know
 owned
 turned
 into
 the


government
 statized
 and
 and
 terrible


incentives
 started
 being
 created
 and
 uh


more
 and
 more
 people
 felt
 excluded
 from


that
 you
 know
 wealth
 that
 the
 society


Venezuelan
 society
 was
 getting
 or
 the


country
 was
 getting
 because
 it
 was
 all


in
 hands
 of
 the
 state.
 So
 we've
 never


known
 but
 the
 state
 control
 economy.


We've
 never
 always
 known
 or
 never
 seen


anything
 but
 that
 kind
 of
 socialist
 uh


procedures
 in
 place.
 When
 Travis


arrived,


we
 had
 gone
 through
 a
 political,
 you


know,
 crisis
 and
 and
 and
 there
 were


growing
 tensions
 and
 and,
 you
 know,


planes
 are
 corruption
 in
 the
 political


system,
 the
 party
 system.
 And
 also
 the


price
 of
 oil
 had,
 you
 know,
 declined.
 It


was
 around
 $8
 a
 barrel.
 So


>> he
 came
 with
 a
 populist
 uh
 narrative


offering,
 you
 know,
 everyone
 to
 be
 equal


and
 and
 to
 revenge
 against
 all
 those


that
 were
 guilty
 of
 of
 poverty
 in
 the


the
 country.
 And
 and
 you
 know,
 he


aligned
 with
 actors
 such
 as
 Fidel
 Castro


in
 Cuba
 and
 other
 international


interests
 to
 grab,
 you
 know,
 those
 huge


resources
 Venezuela
 has.
 and
 of
 course


in
 a
 you
 know
 super
 strategic
 geographic


position.
 So
 that's
 how
 he
 got
 there
 and


that
 populist
 system
 turned
 into
 a


democratic
 and
 then
 into
 criminal


structure


>> and
 this
 was
 1999
 that
 he
 came
 to
 power.


>> Yes,
 that
 was
 in
 1999


>> and
 at
 the
 time
 I
 think
 when
 he
 took


office
 oil
 was
 at
 around
 $14
 per
 barrel


>> and
 a
 few
 years
 later
 oil
 spiked
 up
 to


$100
 per
 even.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That's
 true.
 Just
 to


contextualize
 all
 of
 this,
 prior
 to
 his


coming
 to
 power,
 the
 oil
 companies
 had


been
 nationalized.
 So
 to
 your
 point,
 the


government
 was
 really
 the
 economy
 and
 he


promised
 this
 sort
 of
 equality
 and


redistribution
 of
 value
 for
 all
 of
 the


people
 of
 Venezuela.
 Is
 that
 what
 he


promised?
 And
 the
 economy
 was
 really


depressed
 because
 of
 the
 oil
 price
 being


down.


>> Yeah.
 and
 that
 he
 would
 take,
 you
 know,


uh,
 resources
 from
 the
 rich,
 the


companies,
 and
 he
 would
 distribute
 in
 in


in
 poor
 quarters
 and
 and
 in
 in in in
 the


most
 vulnerable
 uh
 parts
 of
 the
 of


society.
 And
 at
 the
 end,
 we
 we
 learned


the
 hard
 way
 that
 effectively
 this
 kind


of
 socialist
 approach
 does
 get
 everyone


equal
 in
 absolute
 mystery
 because


there's
 nothing
 for
 free
 in
 life.
 I
 mean


you
 you
 give
 away
 your
 choices,
 your


decisions.
 It's
 supposedly
 to
 receive


what
 actually
 what
 you
 are
 you
 are


getting
 is
 into
 a
 slave
 uh
 situation
 in


which
 the
 state
 you
 know
 decides
 for
 you


and
 and
 only
 if
 you
 behave
 accordingly


you
 will
 get
 what
 they
 had
 offered.
 So


that's
 what
 we're
 seeing
 right
 now.


Imagine
 this
 David
 the
 country
 that
 has


the
 largest
 oil
 reserves
 in
 the
 world.


I've
 been
 walking
 around
 those
 areas


where
 that
 oil
 is
 actually
 beneath
 the


ground
 and
 you
 see
 children
 eating
 from


garbage.


>> So,


>> it's
 unbelievable.
 And
 I
 think
 to
 your


point,
 and
 I
 was
 going
 to
 bring
 this
 up


later,
 but
 there's
 such
 a
 powerful


lesson
 to
 be
 learned
 for
 the
 West,
 for


America,
 for
 Europe.
 Socialism
 is


slavery.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 story
 that
 you


bring
 to
 the
 world
 is
 one
 of
 slavery


driven
 by
 this
 kind
 of
 socialist


tyranny.
 There
 is
 no
 socialism
 without


tyranny.
 But
 I
 just
 want
 to
 walk
 through


that
 a
 little
 bit
 because
 as
 Chavez
 came


to
 power,
 oil
 went
 up
 to
 $100
 a
 barrel.


Suddenly
 Venezuela's
 oil
 reserves
 made


the
 country
 very
 wealthy.
 And
 he
 then


engaged
 in
 a
 series
 of
 what
 some
 people


have
 described
 to
 me
 as
 pro
 diplomacy


where
 he
 gave
 away
 300,000
 barrels
 of


oil
 per
 day
 to
 the
 Cubans
 at
 a
 50%
 price


discount
 in
 order
 to


make
 the
 Cubans
 a
 surrogate
 in
 order
 to


make
 other
 island
 nations
 in
 the


Caribbean
 in
 the
 African
 island
 states


surrogates.
 And
 that's
 how
 Venezuela


expressed
 their
 political
 influence


around
 the
 world
 was
 through
 the
 power


of
 the
 oil
 reserves
 but
 in
 such
 a
 way


that
 it
 excluded
 the
 people
 from


participation.
 It
 seemed
 to
 be
 very


centralized
 to
 the
 government.
 Maybe
 you


could
 share
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 how
 folks


in
 the
 government
 in
 the
 military
 under


Chavez
 lived
 these
 incredible
 lives
 with


wealth
 and
 luxury
 while
 the
 people
 were


impoverished.
 Any
 anecdotes
 you
 could


share
 on
 that?
 Yeah,
 sure.
 Look,
 this
 is


a
 this
 is
 this
 is
 a
 side
 that's
 being


the,
 you
 know,
 tried
 in
 Venezuela
 and


elsewhere.
 You
 get
 into
 power
 through


elections
 and
 then
 from
 within
 you
 start


undermining
 every
 single
 democratic


institution.
 You
 go
 against
 the
 media,


you
 control
 the
 media
 and
 it's
 and
 and


you
 can
 see
 this
 pattern
 in
 Venezuela.


about
 how
 Chavez
 started,
 you
 know,


pressing
 or
 or
 buying
 space
 and


publicity
 and
 then
 buying
 the
 whole


media
 outlets
 and
 through
 censorship
 and


and
 through
 and
 changing
 the
 laws
 in


order
 for
 to
 be
 very
 very
 risky
 to
 speak


out
 and
 and
 then
 it
 went
 also
 with
 the


private
 sector
 in
 every
 single
 area
 of


production
 and
 of
 course
 it
 took
 the


military
 as
 well.
 I
 mean
 all
 those
 that


were
 the
 most
 competent
 uh
 individuals


that
 were
 put
 aside
 and
 only
 those
 that


were
 absolutely
 loyal
 to
 the
 regime
 were


offended.
 So
 this
 is
 and
 you
 destroy


married
 merit
 at
 and
 and
 so
 that
 anybody


uh
 realizes
 that
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 part


of
 of
 the
 system,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 work


for
 the
 state
 or
 or
 the
 academy
 or
 in


the
 military,
 it
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


your
 competence
 or
 knowledge
 or
 talent,


but
 you
 have
 to
 be
 absolutely
 loyal
 and


and
 lower
 your
 head
 to
 the
 regime.
 and


and
 and
 this
 progressively
 imagine
 all


the
 resources
 that
 were
 coming
 in


because
 you
 you
 said
 something
 very


important
 that
 some
 people
 do
 not


realize.
 I
 mean
 the
 the the
 the
 barrel


of
 oil
 was
 around
 10
 or
 eight
 when


Chavis
 arrived.
 It
 went
 up
 to
 $150


a
 barrel.
 Imagine
 the
 amount
 of


resources.
 It
 was
 all
 the
 money
 in
 the


world
 that
 they
 used
 effectively
 to
 buy


loyal
 and
 and and
 to
 lobby
 around
 the


world
 and
 to
 support
 ideological
 uh


groups
 all
 over
 all
 over
 the
 the
 the


western
 hemisphere
 and
 elsewhere.
 So
 and


and
 these
 groups
 and
 these
 let's
 say


these
 terms
 um
 get
 get
 in
 contact
 with


each
 other.
 They
 exchange
 technology,


they
 exchange
 information,
 they
 support


each
 other
 in
 international
 forms.
 And


that's
 why
 you
 know
 they
 get
 so
 powerful


in
 their
 different
 uh
 areas
 and
 and
 and


countries.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 what
 we


had
 seen
 is
 that
 democracies
 and


democratic
 movements
 in
 our
 in
 our
 side


of
 the
 world
 are
 very
 isolated.
 We
 we


don't
 help
 each
 other.
 We
 don't
 support


each
 other
 as
 we
 should.
 I
 I
 think
 this


is
 one
 of
 the
 great
 lessons
 that
 we've


we've
 learned
 in
 these
 20
 years


regarding
 the
 the
 the
 amount
 of


resources.
 Look,
 there
 are
 estimates


that
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the


tag
 that
 the
 how
 Venezuela
 was
 robbed
 is


over
 $2
 trillion.


Imagine
 what
 we're
 talking
 about
 in
 this


26
 years.
 And
 uh
 and
 this
 was
 all
 either


went
 for
 corruption
 as
 I
 said
 or
 for


this
 kind
 of
 obscene
 uh
 fortunes
 this


very
 few
 individuals
 have
 while
 86%
 of


our
 population
 nowadays
 lives
 in
 in


poverty.
 The
 pensions
 in
 Venezuela
 are


less
 than
 $1
 a
 month.
 David
 $1
 a
 month.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 under
 Chavez,


there
 was
 also
 this
 embracing
 or
 tieup


with
 the
 drug
 trade,
 the
 FARC,
 Elnia.


What
 is
 the
 alignment?
 What
 was
 the


reason
 that
 the
 Chavez
 regime
 and
 now


the
 Maduro
 regime
 aligns
 with
 the
 drug


cartels
 given
 the
 oil
 wealth,
 given
 the


international
 diplomatic
 ties
 because
 of


the
 oil
 trade?
 Why
 is
 there
 also
 a
 drug


tie
 up
 and
 what
 is
 the
 motivation
 and


the
 incentive
 and
 drive
 there?


>> Well,
 that
 that
 the
 Brock
 business
 isn't


that
 new.
 Actually,
 it
 started
 before


Charles
 arrived
 and
 many
 individuals
 in


the
 military
 had
 had
 ties
 to
 them.
 But


they
 realized
 it
 could
 be
 even
 much
 more


uh
 uh
 the
 margins
 are
 even
 larger
 than


than
 in
 oil
 and
 the
 greed
 in
 these


individuals
 in
 this
 criminal
 structure


is
 unlimited.
 It's
 infinite.
 So
 they
 not


only
 went
 into
 drugs
 uh
 drug


trafficking,
 they
 went
 into
 gold


smuggling,
 arms
 smuggling,
 even
 human


trafficking.
 I
 mean
 every
 single


criminal
 network
 in
 the
 world
 has
 has


you
 know
 converged
 into
 Venezuela
 that


has
 been
 turned
 into
 a
 safe
 heaven
 for


for
 the
 enemies
 of
 of
 of
 the
 West
 and


and
 the
 enemies
 of
 the
 United
 States.


Imagine
 I
 mean
 Karakas
 is
 three
 hours


away
 from
 Miami.
 So
 having,
 you
 know,
 a


satellite
 of
 Russia,
 of
 Iran
 operating


in
 the
 heart
 of
 the
 Americas,
 it's
 it's


something
 that,
 you
 know,
 this
 these


regimes
 around
 the
 world
 had
 always


dreamed
 of.
 Um
 even
 terrorist
 groups


such
 as
 Hezbollah,
 Hamas
 uh
 to
 which


Chavez
 and
 Maduro
 had
 given
 uh
 thousands


of
 Venezuelan
 identities
 and
 passports


to
 travel
 around
 freely
 around
 the


world.


So
 under
 Chavez,
 the
 GDP
 declined
 70%.


There
 was
 mass
 starvation,
 highest
 crime


rates
 in
 the
 world,
 90%
 poverty
 rate.


Much
 of
 the
 stories
 and
 and
 anecdotes


that
 you've
 shared
 have
 been
 reported


publicly
 by
 international
 organizations.


You
 are
 32
 years
 old
 when
 Chavez
 comes


to
 power.
 3
 years
 later,


you
 start
 a
 civil
 organization
 called


Sumate.
 What
 were
 you
 doing
 when
 Chavez


came
 to
 power
 professionally
 and
 what


motivated
 you
 to
 get
 involved
 in
 the


civic
 engagement
 that
 carried
 you


forward
 to
 today?


Well,
 I
 had
 been
 working
 in
 in
 the


private
 uh
 auto
 parks
 and
 steel
 industry


following
 my
 father's
 steps
 and
 um
 and


also
 I
 was
 involved
 in
 a
 in
 um
 in
 an
 NGO


that
 took
 over
 a
 children
 shelter
 for


abandoned
 and
 abused
 children
 and
 and


and
 you
 know
 I
 as
 I
 say
 I'd
 never


thought
 I
 would
 get
 involved
 into


politics
 but
 once
 this
 you
 know
 this


individual
 arrives
 and
 it's
 evident
 for


us
 that
 he
 was
 promoting


>> the
 division
 of
 our
 country
 to
 create


tensions
 to
 to
 divide
 even
 families
 even


my
 own
 family.


>> Uh
 the
 degree
 of
 of
 hatred
 of
 violence


in
 in
 his
 speech
 the
 way
 he
 he
 wanted
 to


um
 to
 create
 tensions
 among
 religions,


races.


It
 it
 we
 realized
 that
 that
 was
 going
 to


turn
 hard
 to
 our
 country
 and
 a
 group
 of


friends
 engineers
 decided
 that
 we
 will


work
 to
 to
 gather
 petitions
 for
 a
 recall


referendum.
 We
 thought
 this
 was
 going to


be
 like
 a
 super
 easy
 task
 to
 get
 you


know
 6
 million
 uh
 petitions
 in
 a
 few


weeks
 and
 and
 and
 you
 know
 we
 we
 learned


the
 hard
 way.
 It
 was
 it
 would
 required
 a


totally
 new


uh
 kind
 of
 citizen
 organization.
 Uh
 and


that's
 how
 subat
 means
 join
 up.
 Uh


finally
 was
 managed
 to
 gather
 the
 the


petitions
 in
 just
 one
 day.
 People


millions
 of
 people
 came
 out
 and
 signed


these
 petitions.
 It's
 a
 long
 story.


Chavez
 eventually
 uh
 committed
 fraud
 in


in
 the
 referendum
 and
 and
 stayed
 in


power
 and
 and
 got
 even
 more
 and
 more


autotocratic
 as
 the
 years
 passed
 by.


>> So
 were
 you
 doing
 Sumate
 full-time?
 Did


that
 become
 your
 life's
 work
 at
 that


point?
 And
 then
 how
 did
 you
 make
 the


decision
 to
 run
 for
 the
 National


Assembly
 which
 was
 in
 2011?
 Fast
 forward


9
 years
 after
 founding
 Sumate.


>> Sumate
 was
 like
 an
 awakening
 for
 me
 and


for
 many
 Venezuelans.
 We
 we
 realized


that
 we
 could
 not
 rely
 our
 citizenship


in
 political
 parties
 and
 that
 you
 cannot


be
 complaining
 about
 politics
 if
 you
 are


not
 willing
 to
 do
 your
 part.
 And
 that's


why
 you
 know
 it
 came
 a
 day
 when
 I
 say


look
 you
 know
 I
 I
 I
 know
 how
 politics


are
 doing
 how
 it
 works.
 I
 don't
 like
 it.


So
 I
 cannot
 complain
 if
 I'm
 not
 willing


to
 take
 my
 own
 steps.
 So
 I
 I
 took
 this


fellowship
 to
 to
 to
 a
 program
 in
 of


leadership
 at
 Yale
 University
 and
 and
 it


you
 know
 it
 was
 like
 seeing
 my
 life
 from


above
 and
 I
 made
 that
 huge
 decision
 that


I
 was
 going
 you
 know
 go
 for
 it.
 I
 was
 I


was
 going
 to
 run
 for
 Congress.
 I
 had
 no


political
 party.
 I
 had
 no
 experience.


You
 know,
 everything
 was
 against
 me.


Everybody
 told
 me,
 "You
 are
 crazy.


You're
 never
 gonna
 win.
 You
 are
 never


gonna
 get
 support.
 Nobody's
 going
 to


support
 someone,
 you
 know,
 whose
 family


has
 resources,
 who's
 a
 woman.
 You
 are


divorced.
 You
 are
 not
 a
 socialist.
 I


mean,
 I
 have
 every
 single
 condition
 to


fail."


And
 uh
 I
 I
 I
 decided
 you
 know
 I


I
 felt
 it
 was
 my
 responsibility.
 I
 could


not
 you
 know


get
 a
 afraid
 of
 and
 and and
 I
 had
 to


trust
 my
 own
 you
 know
 feeling
 and
 it
 was


impressive.
 you
 know,
 volunteers


started,
 you
 know,
 contacting
 me
 and
 in


a
 matter
 of
 months
 with
 no
 money


whatsoever,
 no
 organization,
 no
 media,


nothing


uh
 I
 won
 I
 won
 the
 primaries
 and
 then
 I


for
 the
 for
 the
 national
 uh
 uh
 um


assembly.
 That
 was
 in
 2010


and
 and
 then
 I
 won
 the
 the
 election
 with


the
 highest
 number
 of
 votes
 in
 in


Venezuelan
 Congress
 history.


>> Amazing.
 How
 much
 of
 a
 role
 did
 the


internet
 play?
 I
 worked
 at
 Google
 a
 long


time
 ago
 and
 we
 always
 had
 this


conversation
 that
 the
 internet
 is
 going


to
 create
 a
 democratization
 of


information
 that
 you
 no
 longer
 had


centralized
 control
 of
 information


through
 media
 and
 in
 the
 case
 of


Venezuela
 media
 that
 is
 effectively


controlled
 by
 a
 government
 that
 wants
 to


stay
 in
 power.
 Did
 the
 internet
 play
 a


role
 in
 giving
 you
 the
 ability
 to
 reach


people
 around
 the
 country
 in
 2010
 to
 be


able
 to
 get
 elected?


>> Absolutely.
 And
 not
 only
 that
 in
 2010
 I


wouldn't
 have
 won
 if
 it
 wasn't
 for
 the


internet


>> right


>> I
 mean
 no
 media
 outlet
 would
 dare
 to


interview
 me
 and
 it
 was
 a
 way
 in
 which


we
 could
 organize
 because
 we
 have
 no


resources.
 Uh
 but
 further
 ahead,
 let
 me


tell
 you,
 I
 know
 how
 there
 are
 so
 many


concerns
 about
 the
 use
 of
 technology
 by


by
 by
 the
 by
 bad
 guys
 and
 and
 and
 by
 by


the
 regimes
 that
 are
 autocratic
 and


Venezuela
 is,
 you
 know,
 a
 textbook
 case


of
 how
 you
 get
 infiltrated,
 persecuted,


manipulation
 and
 so
 on.
 But
 if
 it
 wasn't


for
 technology,
 we
 wouldn't
 be
 here
 at


the
 threshold


of
 freedom.


>> And
 and
 this
 is
 something
 that
 we
 need


to
 really
 highlight
 David.


>> So
 you
 are
 like
 all
 great
 revolutionary


leaders
 speaking
 truth
 to
 power.
 You


have
 a
 seat
 at
 the
 table
 now.
 You're
 in


the
 National
 Assembly.
 And
 then
 in
 March


of
 2014,
 you
 address
 the
 Organization
 of


American
 States
 about
 Venezuela's
 human


rights.
 And
 then
 a
 few
 days
 later
 you


were
 expelled
 from
 the
 assembly
 and
 then


there
 was
 all
 this
 legal
 stuff
 that


happened
 which
 we
 don't
 need
 to
 get


into.
 But
 can
 you
 just
 frame
 up
 what


happened
 in
 that
 moment
 kind
 of
 what


your
 narrative
 is
 on
 the
 transition


where
 they
 said
 you
 can
 no
 longer
 be
 a


representative
 here
 anymore?


Well,
 I
 had
 had
 a
 previous
 experience


just
 one
 year
 before


because
 we
 went
 for
 a
 presidential


election
 and
 we
 won
 against
 Maduro
 when


Chavez
 died
 and
 they
 they
 committed


fraud
 and
 we
 weren't
 able
 to
 prove
 it


that
 that
 we
 have
 won.
 And
 that
 was
 in


in
 in
 in
 April
 2013
 and
 and
 I
 went
 back


to
 the
 National
 Assembly.
 I
 stood
 up
 and


I
 said,
 "Baduro
 is
 not
 the
 legitimate


president.
 We
 won."
 And
 suddenly
 I
 hear


someone
 calling
 my
 name.
 I
 turn
 around


and
 there
 was
 this
 member
 of
 the


parliament
 of
 the
 terrorista
 regime
 that


hit
 me
 on
 in
 the
 face
 and
 she
 broke
 my


nose
 in
 five
 pieces
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 and


we
 were
 locked
 in
 in
 Congress.
 I
 were


thrown
 to
 the
 floor.
 I
 was
 kicked
 by


this
 and
 Cave
 was
 watching
 everything.


He
 was
 the
 president
 of
 of
 the
 National


Assembly.
 So
 this
 was,
 you
 know,
 an
 an


evidence
 that
 violence
 had
 gotten
 out
 of


control.
 Imagine
 if
 you
 can
 do
 that
 in
 a


in
 a
 t
 TV.
 It
 was
 seen
 on
 TV
 uh


throughout
 the
 the
 country
 and
 the
 world


while
 they
 were
 shouting
 us.
 So
 next


year
 we
 started
 peaceful
 protest
 and
 and


um
 the
 regime
 ordered
 young
 people
 that


were
 in
 the
 streets,
 you
 know,
 just
 with


with
 with
 with
 plaques
 to
 be
 shot
 at.
 Uh


so
 I
 went
 to
 the
 OAS,
 organization
 of


American
 States,
 and
 it
 was
 the
 first


time
 Vaduro
 was
 accused
 of
 human
 rights


violations
 internationally.
 As
 soon
 as
 I


came
 back,
 they
 they
 they
 you
 know
 just


ejected
 me
 from
 the
 National
 Assembly


and
 by
 force
 prohibited
 me
 from
 going


back
 into
 my
 seat.


So
 um
 it
 was
 a
 very
 hard
 moment
 but
 at


the
 same
 time
 it
 was
 a
 great
 opportunity


because
 I
 realized
 that
 I
 needed
 to


reach
 out
 personally


to
 to
 our
 country
 and
 create
 a
 totally


new
 organization
 that
 promoted
 uh
 our


ideas
 and
 prepared
 for
 the
 next
 stage
 of


of
 the
 struggle


>> and
 this
 was
 in
 2014.
 Can
 you
 share


about
 the
 Maduro
 transition?
 Maduro
 is


on
 paper
 seemingly
 wouldn't
 have
 been


the
 natural
 successor
 to
 Chavez.
 He


started
 out
 as
 a
 bus
 driver
 and
 then
 he


was
 a
 union
 leader.
 It's
 unclear
 from


the
 outside
 what
 makes
 Maduro
 the
 the


selected
 successor
 to
 Chavez.
 What
 is
 it


about
 him
 as
 a
 man,
 as
 a
 person,
 his


character
 that
 made
 him
 the
 successor
 to


the
 Chavez
 regime?


>> Well,
 Maduro
 was
 trained
 in
 Cuba.
 So,
 it


was
 the
 Cubans
 who
 chose
 Maduro.
 It
 was


a
 a
 very
 easy
 option
 for
 them.
 totally


loyal
 to
 the
 communist
 uh
 pastoral


regime
 and
 um
 Budo
 has
 no
 no


you
 know
 no
 nothing
 restricts
 him
 from


exercising
 you
 know
 violence
 and
 and
 and


and
 force
 for
 his
 uh
 ideas


and
 he
 certainly
 doesn't
 have
 chavis


charisma
 uh
 nor
 not nor
 not
 the
 the


degree
 of
 control
 in
 in
 the
 other
 groups


so
 they
 were
 creating
 you
 know,
 like
 a


group
 of
 of
 of
 of
 uh
 individuals
 that


that
 the
 control
 of
 the
 of
 of
 the
 the


system,
 the
 strategy,
 the
 the
 structure


that
 control
 the
 military,
 the
 financial


enablers,
 uh
 the
 uh
 criminal
 networks


and
 the
 political
 sectors.
 And
 that's


how
 he
 he
 went
 over
 taking
 more
 and
 more


control
 and
 turning
 Venezuela,
 as
 I


mentioned
 before,
 into
 this
 safe
 heaven


of
 criminal
 activities.
 and
 he
 himself


turned
 into
 the
 head
 of
 these
 structures


when
 we
 heard
 about
 the
 deawa
 now
 about


the
 cartel
 loles
 the
 cartel
 of
 the
 sons


I
 mean
 these
 are
 structures
 that
 we
 have


denounced
 for
 years
 and
 we
 have
 tried


the
 word
 to
 understand
 that
 this
 was
 not


a
 conventional
 dictatorship
 anymore


this
 is
 a
 you
 know
 a
 very
 complex


structure
 that
 that
 you
 know
 produces


obscene
 amounts
 of
 resources
 uh
 not
 only


for
 them
 but
 also
 for
 very
 dangerous


allies
 that
 come
 from
 very
 far
 such
 as


the
 ones
 I
 mentioned
 before
 and


terrorist
 groups
 and
 so
 on.
 They
 you


know
 they
 turned
 Venezuela
 into
 one
 of


of
 the
 Russians
 main
 buyers
 of
 of
 uh


army
 and
 and
 and
 weapons
 and
 uh
 also
 one


of
 the
 the
 I
 would
 say
 the
 the
 major


stronghold
 of
 the
 Iranian
 regime
 abroad.


I
 mean
 they
 use
 Venezuelan
 financial


system
 to
 bypass
 financial
 sector,


financial
 sanctions
 and
 and
 they
 use
 our


territory
 to
 to
 operate
 freely.


>> And
 what
 about
 China?
 Can
 you
 share
 a


little
 bit
 about
 China's
 relationship


with
 Venezuelan
 leadership
 in
 Maduro
 and


when
 that
 became
 an
 more
 kind
 of


intimate
 economic
 tie?
 Well,
 Venezuela


turned
 out
 to
 be
 uh
 China's
 main
 uh
 um


debtor
 with
 over
 60
 60
 billion
 uh


dollars
 in
 in
 depths
 that
 uh
 you
 know


accounted
 for
 all
 kinds
 of
 different


projects
 that
 were
 never
 built
 and
 uh


and
 and
 certainly
 China
 realized
 that


Venezuela's
 you
 know
 natural
 endowments


are
 unique
 absolutely
 unique
 it


strategical.
 Um,
 nonetheless,
 uh,
 the


the
 degree
 of
 corruption
 in
 the
 system


and
 in
 this
 system
 is
 so
 so
 big
 that


China
 stopped
 funding
 Maduro
 about
 seven


years
 ago
 and
 simply
 is
 getting,
 you


know,
 the
 oil
 to
 to
 pay
 for
 the
 debts


that
 are
 still
 um
 pending.
 Um,
 I
 I
 I


believe


China,
 you
 know,
 understands
 the
 the
 the


strategic
 importance
 Venezuela
 has
 also


for
 its
 geographic
 location.
 Um,
 but
 but


has
 been
 more
 prudent
 because
 of
 the


degree
 of
 of
 corruption
 that
 they
 have


suffered
 from
 for
 Maduro
 and
 and
 the


regime.
 But
 there's
 al
 also
 the
 side
 of


the
 if
 you
 know
 the
 intelligence
 uh


espionage


uh
 and
 technology
 and
 satellites
 from


China
 that
 have
 been
 installed
 in


Venezuela.
 That's
 a
 very
 important


dimension
 for
 them
 as
 well.


>> Venezuela
 is
 a
 country
 of
 I
 think
 28


million
 people.
 By
 some
 estimates
 8


million
 people
 have
 fled
 the
 country.


Does
 that
 feel
 accurate
 to
 you?
 Can
 you


provide
 some
 anecdotes
 of
 why
 people


leave,
 where
 they
 go,
 and
 what
 it's
 like


in
 the
 country
 that's
 causing
 this
 mass


exodus
 of
 the
 population?


>> Look,
 we
 are
 the
 nation
 of
 little
 over


30
 million.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 a
 country


where
 you
 have
 no
 information


whatsoever.
 Imagine
 living
 in
 a
 country


where
 you
 know
 how
 many
 you
 are.
 You


don't
 know
 what's
 the
 the
 size
 of
 your


debt
 or
 your
 GDP
 or
 or
 inflation.


Nothing.
 It's
 a
 black
 box.
 you
 know


that's
 that's
 that's
 why
 it's
 also
 a


challenge
 in
 terms
 of
 what's
 coming
 up


but
 um
 roughly
 9
 million
 people
 have


left
 it
 is
 you
 know
 around
 30%
 of
 our


population
 imagine
 if
 a
 30%


of
 American
 people
 leave
 what
 it
 would


mean
 no
 it's
 devastating
 because
 we're


seeing
 you
 know
 our
 young
 people
 our


children
 doctors
 engineers
 scientists


nurses
 teachers


And
 of
 course
 they
 go
 because
 the


situation
 from
 an
 economic
 perspective


is
 is
 horrible
 but
 mostly
 because
 you


don't
 see
 a
 future
 in
 your
 country


because
 you
 feel
 there's
 no
 possibility


to
 survive.
 So
 women
 that
 have
 left


their
 young
 children
 back
 only
 to
 send


something
 for
 them
 to
 eat.


>> Children
 that
 have
 left
 their
 parents


alone.
 I
 I've
 met
 so
 many
 so
 many


grandparents
 that
 have
 not
 met
 their


grandchildren
 yet
 and
 and
 they
 cry
 and


hug
 me
 and
 ask
 me
 please
 please
 bring
 my


grandchildren
 back
 and
 we
 all
 know
 that


the
 only
 possibility
 for
 that
 to
 happen


is
 that
 we
 you
 know
 have
 a
 transition
 to


democracy
 and
 when
 that
 happens
 David


you
 will
 see
 the
 day
 Maduro
 goes


hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 Venezuelans


voluntarily
 coming
 back
 even
 though
 they


know
 it's
 a
 hard
 moment
 that
 we'll
 have


you
 know
 to
 work
 really
 hard
 but
 we
 we


know
 the
 potential
 that
 unique
 potential


and
 and
 you
 know
 they
 want
 to
 be
 part
 of


this
 it's
 much
 more
 than
 a
 political


struggle
 for
 us
 it's
 an
 existential


struggle
 as
 a
 nation
 and
 also
 spiritual


struggle
 as
 well


>> a
 lot
 of
 people
 will
 say
 why
 don't
 they


go
 on
 the
 streets
 today
 can
 you
 talk
 a


little
 bit
 about
 the
 intimid
 imidation


of
 the
 Maduro
 regime
 and
 why
 it's
 so


difficult
 for
 people
 to
 rise
 up
 in
 the


way
 that
 we
 have
 seen
 other
 revolutions


historically
 around
 the
 world.
 What


keeps
 that
 from
 happening?
 What
 are
 the


mechanisms
 that
 are
 used
 to
 stay
 in


power
 uh
 by
 the
 Maduro
 regime?


>> Look,
 and
 and
 we
 have
 seen
 that
 in


Venezuela
 many
 times
 as
 well.
 I
 mean,


we're
 talking
 about
 thousands
 of
 times


in
 protests,
 in
 peaceful,
 you
 know,


rallies,
 in
 people
 going
 out
 by
 by
 tens


of
 thousand
 and
 even
 hundreds
 of


thousands.
 But
 the
 regime
 has
 developed,


this
 regime,
 Maduro,
 with
 the
 Cuban


intelligence
 mechanisms
 to
 infiltrate


and
 anyone
 who
 goes
 out
 is
 either


detained,
 harmed,
 killed,
 disappeared.


When
 we
 won
 the
 election
 last
 year
 in


July
 28,
 thousands
 of
 people
 went
 to
 the


streets
 while
 we
 were
 counting
 the


votes,
 which
 I
 want
 to
 tell
 you
 a
 little


bit
 more
 ahead.
 And
 you
 know
 in
 a
 matter


of
 24
 hours
 2500
 people
 were
 in
 prison


including


young
 people,
 children,
 women
 that
 were


even
 sexually
 assaulted,
 abused
 just


because
 they
 had
 gone
 out
 to
 the
 streets


to
 peacefully
 claim
 for
 their
 right
 for


popular
 subject
 sovereignty
 to
 be


respected.
 But
 they
 went
 beyond
 that,


David.
 They
 went
 to
 the
 houses
 of
 our
 of


our
 of
 our
 activists
 that
 had
 been


taking
 care
 of
 the
 election
 that
 that


work
 as
 witnesses
 that
 take
 took
 care
 of


the
 town
 sheets
 and
 and
 and
 they
 took


them
 away.
 And
 if
 they
 weren't
 there,


then
 they
 would
 grab
 their
 families,


their
 mothers,
 their
 children,
 their


their
 couples,
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 every


single
 person
 who
 even
 posted
 my
 picture


on
 their
 on
 their,
 you
 know,
 Instagram


account
 for
 X
 account,
 whatever,
 they


would
 go
 and
 take
 them
 as
 well.
 Uh
 so
 it


was
 so
 brutal


uh
 that
 the
 interamerican
 commission
 of


of
 human
 rights
 label
 it
 as
 state


terrorism
 and
 the
 factf
 finding
 mission


of
 the
 United
 Nation
 uh
 has
 said
 those


are
 crimes
 against
 humanity.
 It
 was
 so


wide
 so
 systematic
 that
 what
 they
 wanted


is
 to
 terrify


a
 society.


So,
 we've
 had
 these
 last
 15
 months,
 a


period
 of
 of
 darkness
 as
 we've
 never


seen
 before.


>> I
 I
 was
 accused
 of
 terrorism,
 but
 it
 is


searching
 for
 me.


He
 said
 I
 would
 spend
 the
 rest
 of
 my


life
 in
 prison.
 Some
 people
 think
 it


would
 be
 even
 worse.
 Um
 but
 you
 know
 all


my
 team
 which
 you
 know
 managed
 the


campaign
 this
 incredible
 campaign
 that


took
 place
 are
 either
 in
 prison


or
 they
 had
 to
 leave
 the
 country.
 So


this
 is
 a
 moment
 in
 which
 you
 know
 fear


uh
 has
 been
 you
 know
 imposed


by
 by
 brutal
 force
 but
 that
 doesn't
 mean


that
 Van
 society
 is
 neutralized
 on
 the


country
 as
 we
 managed
 to
 organize
 for
 an


incredible
 epic
 episode
 when
 we
 won
 the


election.
 Now
 we
 have
 been
 organizing


underground
 and
 preparing
 for
 the
 day
 in


which
 trans
 democracy
 will
 come
 and


people
 will
 make
 sure
 it
 is
 an
 orderly


process.


>> Maduro
 has
 publicly
 said
 many
 times
 that


you
 are
 a
 puppet
 of
 the
 west
 that
 the
 US


and
 its
 allies
 are
 trying
 to
 interfere


in
 Venezuelan
 politics
 because
 of
 their


economic
 interest
 in
 the
 Venezuelan
 oil


reserves.
 I
 want
 to
 give
 you
 a
 moment
 to


respond
 to
 those
 claims.
 I
 think
 you've


done
 an
 amazing
 job
 highlighting
 your


motivation
 and
 the
 on
 the
 ground


experience,
 but
 um
 can
 we
 counter
 or


have
 a
 conversation
 about
 this
 belief


which
 by
 the
 way
 many
 have
 made
 because


of
 the
 US
 involvement
 in
 Middle
 East
 and


Middle
 East
 politics
 and
 the
 US's


absence
 of
 involvement
 in
 politics
 in


countries
 that
 are
 not
 oil
 rich.
 Maybe


we
 could
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the
 the


importance
 of
 this
 for
 the
 West.
 not


just
 the
 economic
 interest
 but
 you
 know


what
 else
 is
 motivating
 this
 and
 why
 is


the
 US
 interested
 in
 supporting
 your


cause


>> that
 claim
 is
 not
 very
 original
 I
 mean


that's
 what
 all
 of
 these
 guys
 say
 to


anyone
 that
 speaks
 out
 if
 even
 if
 it's


you
 know
 a
 a
 a
 union
 leader
 student
 or
 a


priest


>> and
 frankly
 you
 know
 I
 couldn't
 care


less
 what
 they
 say
 you
 know
 we
 know
 what


we
 are
 what
 we
 believe
 and
 what
 the


people
 and
 why
 people
 trust
 us.
 We
 have


managed
 to
 build
 the
 strongest
 citizen


movement
 in
 our
 country's
 history.


Starting
 on
 2023
 when
 Venezuela
 looked


hopeless
 and
 divided
 and
 without
 a


chance
 to
 move
 ahead,
 we
 reached
 out
 to


every
 single
 I
 went
 to
 every
 single


corner
 of
 my
 country.
 Look,
 I
 went
 with


my
 car
 because
 I've
 been
 banned
 from


living
 Venezuela
 for
 over
 12
 years.
 I'm


not
 even
 allowed
 to
 buy
 a
 a
 local
 flight


ticket.
 So
 they
 thought
 they
 were


hurting
 me,
 but
 actually
 they
 they
 gave


me
 that
 biggest
 opportunity
 to
 to
 to
 you


know
 go
 through
 my
 country
 from
 one


point
 to
 the
 other
 and
 to
 talk
 to
 people


to
 listen
 to
 learn
 to
 understand
 to
 get


really
 close
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 we
 are
 in


what
 we
 believe
 to
 turn
 down
 those


barriers
 the
 regime
 had
 built
 to
 divide


us
 and
 to
 find
 out
 that
 this
 is
 not


about
 left
 or
 right
 or
 poor,
 black
 or


white.
 It
 is
 about
 human
 dignity.
 It's


about
 respect,
 solidarity,
 cooperation,


freedom,
 and
 love
 and
 love,
 which
 is
 the


strongest
 force
 that
 has
 brought
 us


together.
 You
 know,
 I've
 seen
 people


that
 were
 close
 to
 the
 Chadista
 for


years
 coming
 to
 me,
 crying,
 hugging
 me,


asking
 for
 forgiveness,
 and
 I
 said,
 "No,


I
 have
 nothing
 to
 forgive."
 You
 know,
 we


have
 a
 common


goal
 now.
 We
 have
 a
 common
 vision.
 We


all
 want
 our
 kids
 back
 all.
 And
 that's


precisely
 what's
 happening
 right
 now.


So,
 look,
 Venezuela
 is
 for
 me
 the


country
 with
 the
 largest
 opportunities


not
 only
 for
 the
 United
 States
 and
 the


rest
 of
 the
 West.
 I
 mean,
 imagine,
 and


I'm
 not
 talking
 about
 our
 natural


endowments,
 which
 are
 huge.
 We'll


already
 address
 that.
 or
 infrastructure


or
 even
 our
 geographical
 position.
 It's


our
 people
 what
 we
 have
 endured
 and
 the


way
 we
 have
 come
 together.
 And
 I've


heard
 recently
 some
 people
 talking
 about


that
 you
 know
 once
 Madura
 goes
 out


because
 it
 will
 leave
 soon
 you
 know


there's
 this
 risk
 of
 of
 you
 know
 um


civil
 war
 or
 unrest.
 Give
 me
 a
 break.


We're
 talking
 about
 a
 country
 where
 90%


of
 the
 population
 we
 all
 want
 the
 same.


There
 are
 no
 religious
 differences.


There
 are
 no
 racial
 tensions,
 no
 social


or
 political
 differences.
 We
 all
 want


the
 same.
 And
 we
 have
 fought
 so
 hard
 for


freedom
 that
 we
 are
 the
 ones
 who
 are


guaranteed
 that
 this
 will
 be
 an
 orderly


transition.
 And
 yes,
 we
 are
 close
 to
 the


United
 States
 values
 and
 culture.
 Yes,


we
 are.
 We
 admire
 a
 nation
 that
 has


strong
 democratic
 institutions
 that
 feel


proud
 for
 for
 their
 achievements,
 their


history,
 their
 legacy
 and
 so
 are
 we.
 So


look,
 you
 know
 those
 kind
 of
 of


socialist
 rhetoric


nowadays
 is
 useless
 in
 Venezuela.
 You


know,
 we
 have
 only
 known
 socialism
 and


Venezuela
 today
 is
 a
 country
 I
 believe


that
 you
 know
 most
 people
 embrace
 open


markets,
 respect
 for
 private
 property,


merit
 and
 collaboration.


>> I
 want
 to
 just
 talk
 about
 the
 election


and
 then
 I'd
 like
 to
 ask
 your
 view
 on


the
 United
 States
 today.
 But
 let's
 talk


about
 the
 election.
 Two
 years
 ago
 you


ran
 for
 president.
 You
 won
 the
 primary


with
 a
 resounding
 victory
 in
 October
 26,


2023.
 Today,
 you're
 sitting
 in
 a


basement.
 You're
 not
 in
 the
 office
 of


the
 president.
 Can
 we
 walk
 through
 what


happened?
 What
 was
 that
 campaign
 like?


How
 did
 you
 reach
 the
 people
 given
 that


you
 didn't
 have
 access
 to
 the
 state


media
 and
 then
 maybe
 share
 a
 little
 bit


about
 that
 primary
 victory
 and
 what


happened
 afterwards?
 Yeah,
 you
 know,
 we


realized
 as
 I
 said
 in
 in
 January
 2023


that
 we
 need
 needed
 to
 get,
 you
 know,


trust
 back,
 you
 know,
 Venezuelan
 people,


trust
 ourselves
 and
 trust
 each
 other
 and


and
 the
 primary
 had
 this
 incredible


opportunity
 of
 giving
 power
 to
 the


people
 and
 not
 the
 political
 parties


that
 used
 to
 decide,
 you
 know,
 which
 the


candidates
 were.
 So
 we
 decided
 to
 push


for
 a
 primary
 and
 a
 primary
 in
 which
 the


regime
 would
 not
 get
 involved.
 Uh
 in
 in


Venezuela
 in
 previous
 primaries
 process


the
 the
 the
 regime
 electoral
 uh
 or
 uh


entity
 would
 organize
 primaries
 and
 we


said
 this
 time
 no
 way
 we're
 going
 to
 do


it
 organized
 by
 citizens.
 It
 was
 a
 huge


challenge
 and
 a
 great
 risk
 and
 we


believe
 the
 regime
 totally


underestimated
 us.
 They
 thought
 that


perhaps,
 you
 know,
 100
 200,000
 people


might
 appear
 and
 vote
 and
 so
 on
 and
 and


that's
 why
 they
 they
 let
 it
 go,
 let
 it


run.
 And
 when
 October
 22nd,
 you
 know,


it's
 two
 years
 ago
 exactly,
 they
 came,
 I


was
 a
 candidate,
 there
 were
 10


candidates,
 and
 I
 thought,
 well,
 it's
 a


miracle
 that
 that
 it's
 just
 this
 is


happening
 as
 we
 as
 as as
 we're
 seeing


it.


At
 mid
 morning
 around
 10
 or
 11
 in
 the


morning,
 I
 start
 getting
 calls
 from
 all


around
 the
 country
 saying,
 "We
 run
 out


of
 ballots."
 I
 said,
 "What
 do
 you
 mean?


I
 mean,
 it's
 only
 3
 hours
 of
 of
 the


process.
 What
 do
 you
 mean
 we
 run
 out
 of


ballots?"
 So
 many
 people
 showed
 up.
 Over


3
 million
 Venezuelans.
 And
 it
 was
 such
 a


courageous
 act,
 David,
 because
 going
 out


meant
 that
 you
 were
 voting
 for
 the


opposition.
 No.
 So
 this
 was
 huge.
 I'm


talking
 about
 remote


towns
 that
 we
 need
 to
 have
 river
 boats


in
 order
 to
 get
 the
 results
 and
 and
 also


Venezuelans
 around
 the
 world
 because
 I


insisted
 and
 many
 of
 us
 that
 Venezuelans


abroad
 our
 diaspora
 shouldn't
 be
 allowed


to
 vote.
 So
 that
 day
 our
 country
 came


together.


I
 I
 I
 I
 am
 humbled.
 I
 am
 grateful.
 I
 I


got
 92%
 of
 the
 votes
 and
 and
 Maduro


realized
 that,
 you
 know,
 they
 they


wouldn't
 be
 able
 to
 stop
 me.
 So,
 they


they
 banned
 me
 from
 participating.


Confess
 to
 you
 that
 it
 was
 one
 of
 those


really
 tough
 days
 in
 your
 life
 because


it
 was
 so
 unfair.
 I
 mean,
 I
 had
 a


mandate,
 but
 you
 know,
 I
 could
 have


blown
 everything,
 but
 I
 decided,
 no,
 we


have
 to
 keep
 on
 going,
 and
 we're
 gonna


have
 find
 someone
 that
 is
 willing
 to


take
 my
 place.
 And
 once
 again,
 the


regime
 underestimated
 us
 because
 they


accepted
 a
 74
 year
 old
 diplomat
 that


nobody
 knew
 who
 he
 was.
 A
 super
 honest,


loyal,
 intelligent,
 good
 person,
 but
 no


one
 knew
 who
 he
 was.
 This
 is
 Edmundo


Gonzalez.


>> Edmundo.
 Exactly.
 Edmundo
 Gonzale


elect.
 And
 uh
 I
 had
 a
 poster
 with
 his


face.
 So
 I
 went
 all
 over
 the
 country


telling
 if
 you
 want
 to
 vote
 for
 me,
 you


have
 to
 vote
 for
 him.
 And
 this
 is
 the


guy.
 And
 uh
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 remember


we
 had
 had
 over
 30
 elections
 that


progressively
 were
 more
 and
 more
 and


more
 and
 more
 fraudulent.
 I
 mean,
 sorry.


Ed
 Mundo
 Gonzalez,
 he
 became
 your


candidate
 in
 July
 of
 2024,
 last
 summer,


just
 to
 be
 clear,
 right?


>> In
 um
 in
 in
 May,


>> May,
 the
 elections
 were
 in
 July.
 Yeah.


Okay.
 Elections
 were
 in
 July.


>> So,
 imagine
 at
 this
 time,
 I
 mean,
 nobody


knew
 who
 the
 candidate
 was


>> and
 we
 everybody
 knew
 we
 were
 facing
 the


most
 fraudulent
 system
 in
 the
 world.
 I


mean
 the
 concept
 of
 of
 fraud
 collections


that
 are
 been
 spreading
 around
 the


world,
 it
 was
 born
 here
 in
 Venezuela


with
 the
 electronic
 machines
 and
 all
 the


the
 stuff
 they've
 been
 creating
 around


it.
 Fear,
 manipulation,
 altering
 their


register
 and
 so
 on.
 So
 we
 realized
 that


we
 needed
 to
 use
 technology
 in
 our
 favor


and
 that's
 why
 we
 managed
 to
 create
 a


legion


of
 volunteers.


We
 trained
 them
 without
 the
 regime


noticing
 that
 we
 were
 training
 them.


There
 were
 5,000
 uh
 sessions
 in
 person


and
 over
 300,000
 people
 trained
 by
 the


internet.
 We
 develop
 apps
 for
 for
 seller


phones
 in
 which
 you
 know
 we
 will
 monitor


every
 single
 polling
 station
 around
 the


the
 country.
 We


>> How
 many
 people
 did
 you
 recruit
 to
 this


legion
 for
 the
 ballot
 monitoring?


>> It
 ended
 up
 being
 more
 than
 1
 million


volunteers.
 Everyone
 with
 a
 specific


task.
 David,
 we
 had
 no
 money.
 We
 could


not
 print
 flyers
 or
 posters.
 You
 know


how
 much
 was
 our
 uh
 publicity
 budget?


Zero.
 We
 didn't
 pay
 for
 one
 ad.
 Nothing.


When
 we
 went
 around
 the
 countries
 and
 we


stayed
 in
 hotels,


the
 regime
 would
 come
 the
 next
 day
 and


close
 a
 hotel.


If
 we
 went
 and
 stopped
 in
 the
 street
 to


to
 buy
 some
 food,
 then
 they
 will
 punish


the
 the
 the
 restaurant
 or
 or
 the
 snack


place.
 I
 mean,
 they
 they
 blocked


streets.
 They
 they
 got
 our
 people
 in
 in


prison,
 persecuted
 those
 that
 were
 in


control
 of
 the
 electoral
 and
 and


organization
 departments.
 I
 mean,
 this


was
 huge.
 But
 they
 turned
 this
 into
 an


epic


and
 and
 citizens
 decided
 that
 it
 was


going
 to
 be
 their
 own
 epic,
 their
 own


victory.
 So
 we
 train
 all
 these
 people


with
 our
 diaspora.
 We
 we
 we
 had
 this
 app


uh
 designed
 and


we
 knew
 and
 this
 is
 a
 very
 important


part
 that
 we
 had
 to
 prove
 our
 victory


for
 the
 first
 time.
 We
 needed
 to
 prove


the
 results.
 So
 we
 designed
 a
 a
 system


through
 which
 we
 would
 collect
 the


original
 poly
 sheets.
 We
 would
 scan
 them


and
 we
 will
 publish
 them
 in
 a
 digitized


web
 page
 super
 robust
 for
 the
 whole


world
 to
 see.


And
 in
 order
 to
 do
 this,
 imagine
 we
 are


in
 a
 country
 where
 60%
 of
 our
 territory


doesn't
 have
 access
 to
 the
 internet
 or


even
 cellular
 phones.
 So
 we
 needed
 to


geotoptimize,


you
 know,
 process
 h
 centers
 to
 process


the
 the
 physical
 sheets
 and
 we
 did
 that.


We
 smuggled
 Starlink
 and
 uh
 antennas


into
 the
 country,
 generators,


laptops,
 cell
 phones,
 and
 without
 origin


noticing
 it,
 we
 we
 we
 installed
 these


130
 operational
 places.
 And
 in
 less
 than


24
 hours
 we
 were
 able
 to
 prove
 our


victory
 with
 the
 you
 know
 the
 images


original
 images
 of
 the
 talifits
 being


seen
 and
 scrutinized
 by
 the
 whole
 world.


They
 were
 audited
 by
 over
 20
 different


independent


technicians
 and
 universities
 and
 they


all
 concluded
 that
 those
 were
 the
 real


results.
 So
 to
 be
 honest,
 I
 think
 we
 do


have
 set
 a
 new
 standard
 for
 electoral


electoral
 integrity,
 not
 only
 in


dictatorships,
 even
 in
 even
 for


democracies.


>> And
 the
 the
 data
 that
 you
 shared
 showed


that
 you
 won
 a
 resounding
 victory.
 Your


party
 won
 the
 the
 presidency
 and
 Maduro


declared
 himself
 the
 winner.


Since
 then,
 he's
 issued
 a
 warrant
 for


your
 arrest.


What
 is
 next
 for
 you?
 What
 is
 next
 for


the
 country?


>> Look,
 it's
 been
 such
 a
 long
 way.
 I
 mean,


it's


have
 so
 many
 colleagues
 and
 friends
 that


are
 currently
 in
 jail


that
 are
 very
 far
 away
 or
 even
 killed.
 I


mean,
 this
 has
 been
 very
 painful,
 but
 at


the
 same
 time,
 we
 have
 grown
 so
 much.
 I


mean,
 we're
 a
 different
 society,
 but


also
 we're
 different
 and
 better


individuals.


We've
 learned
 the
 value
 of
 living
 in


democracy
 and
 being
 free.


And
 uh
 now
 we've
 come
 such
 a
 long
 way.


We
 defeated
 Maduro
 in
 the
 hearts
 and


minds
 of
 the
 Venezuelan
 people.
 We


defeated
 Maduro
 in
 the
 ballot
 boxes.
 We


defeated
 Maduro
 in
 the
 spirit
 of


Venezuela.
 And
 now
 the
 only
 thing
 he's


got
 left
 is
 his,
 you
 know,
 violence.
 and


a
 few
 uh
 top
 brass
 individuals
 and


financial
 enablers
 that
 have
 terrified


those
 uh
 in
 the
 military
 that
 still
 are


you
 know
 supporting
 him.
 But
 you
 know


these
 last
 15
 months
 of
 resilience
 and


resistance
 have
 created
 more
 and
 more


pressure
 from
 within
 and
 now
 finally


we're
 seeing
 a
 reaction
 from
 abroad.
 For


years,
 we
 have
 asked
 the
 world
 to


understand
 that
 this
 is
 a
 criminal


structure.
 And
 as
 such,
 in
 order
 to
 to


break
 it
 down,
 you
 need
 to
 cut
 the


inflows
 of
 criminal
 money
 that
 comes


from
 drug
 trafficking,
 from
 gold


smuggling,
 for
 human
 trafficking,
 or
 or


the
 black
 market
 of
 oil.
 You
 need
 to
 cut


those
 inflows.
 And
 that's
 precisely
 what


President
 Trump
 is
 doing
 right
 now.
 and


and
 and
 we
 are
 very
 grateful
 to
 see
 this


uh
 international
 coalition
 that
 is


applying
 you
 know
 the
 law
 the


enforcement
 of
 the
 law
 on
 this
 criminal


structure
 which
 is
 what
 we
 need.
 I
 mean


Badudo
 for
 so
 so
 this
 long
 years
 have


felt
 uh
 that
 he
 could
 you
 know


disappear,
 kill,
 torture
 people
 with


absolute
 zero
 zero
 cost.
 the
 timing
 of


impunity
 has
 ended
 and
 um
 and
 and
 you


know
 I
 I
 believe
 the
 regime
 is
 its


weakest
 position
 ever.
 They
 understand


this
 is
 serious.
 there
 is
 a
 you
 know
 a


real
 threat
 and
 we
 are
 seeing
 defections


uh
 betrayals
 and
 more
 and
 more
 people


from
 within
 the
 regime
 reaching
 to
 us


and
 what
 we're
 saying
 is
 look
 we
 had


offer
 a
 possibility
 of
 a
 negotiated


transition
 and
 now
 that
 that
 day
 is


closed
 we
 offer
 you
 know
 everybody
 that


decide
 to
 step
 on
 the
 side
 of
 the
 law


that
 they
 can
 be
 part
 of
 this
 huge


transformation
 of
 Venezuela.


Can
 you
 highlight
 the
 moments
 of
 the


American
 presidencies,
 the
 American


administrations,


Obama,
 Biden,
 Donald
 Trump,
 and
 how
 they


have
 supported
 the
 cause
 and
 what's


different
 today?


>> Do
 have
 to
 say
 that,
 you
 know,
 we've
 had


bipartisan
 support
 and
 you
 see
 that
 in


Congress
 even
 yesterday,
 you
 know,
 and


and
 and
 because
 they're,
 you
 know,


sensible
 individuals
 in
 the
 Senate,
 in


the
 House
 that
 understand


that
 it's,
 you
 know,
 it's
 for


humanitarian
 reasons
 because
 of
 its


millions
 of
 lives
 at
 risk
 in
 Minnesota,


but
 it's
 also
 for
 the
 national
 security


of
 the
 United
 States.
 I
 think
 that's,


you
 know,
 it's
 pretty
 well
 proven
 at


this
 point.
 Um,
 but
 so
 far,
 um,
 there


were
 only
 words,
 only
 statements
 and
 no


actions.
 And
 and
 when
 you
 face
 a


criminal
 regime,
 I
 you
 have
 to


understand
 that
 you
 know
 the
 way
 to


reach
 peace
 is
 through
 freedom
 and


freedom
 requires
 strength
 and
 that
 is


moral
 strength,
 spiritual
 strength
 and


physical
 strength
 and
 and
 that's
 what


finally
 the
 regime
 is
 facing
 at
 this


point.
 So
 you
 know
 we're
 very
 we
 are


very
 very
 grateful
 to
 President
 Trump


and
 his
 administration
 for
 you
 know
 the


visionary
 and
 decisive
 way
 he
 has
 act


calling
 things
 by
 their
 names.
 It


requires
 courage.
 Not
 a
 lot
 of
 people


were
 willing
 to
 do
 that
 before.
 So
 now


look,
 we
 are
 prepared


for
 an
 orderly
 transition.
 We
 know
 what


we
 need
 to
 do
 in
 the
 first
 100
 hours,


100
 days
 to
 take
 control
 of
 the


institutions
 and
 our
 territory.


Um,
 Venezuela
 has
 been
 destroyed
 in


every
 possible
 way
 you
 see
 it
 in
 our


economy,
 in
 our
 security,
 in
 our


national
 sovereignty,
 in
 in in
 you
 know


in
 the
 public
 services,
 basic
 services


that
 people
 require.
 But
 our
 people
 are


tougher
 and
 stronger
 than
 ever
 and
 we


are
 determined
 to
 be
 free.
 So,
 this
 is


going
 to
 be
 like
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a


rebirth.
 We're
 going
 to
 turn
 Venezuela


from
 the
 criminal
 hub
 of
 the
 Americas


into
 the
 energy
 hub,
 the
 technology
 hub


and
 the
 democracy
 hub
 of
 the
 Americas.


And
 and
 it
 we
 will
 need
 to
 do
 that
 from


from
 from
 scratch,
 from
 ruins.
 But
 uh


but
 you
 know
 we
 have
 our
 huge
 incredible


diaspora
 that
 are
 willing
 to
 come
 back


and
 imagine
 you
 know
 with
 all
 the


resources
 we
 have
 you
 know
 the
 energy


that
 the
 capacity
 to
 to
 produce
 energy


not
 only
 natural
 gas
 and
 hydroele


electricity
 solar
 and
 so
 on
 you
 know
 we


can
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 so
 attractive
 for


uh
 uh
 for
 those
 who
 want
 to
 invest
 as
 I


said
 not
 only
 in
 energy
 but
 in


technology
 AI


data
 centers.
 I
 mean,
 we
 have
 everything


to
 turn
 Venezuela
 into
 a
 bright
 and
 and


proud
 nation
 very
 fast.


And
 before
 we
 wrap,
 Maria
 Karina,
 I'd


love
 to
 just
 ask
 you
 an
 important


question,
 which
 is
 we
 are
 seeing
 a
 rise


of
 interest
 in
 socialism
 that's


unprecedented
 in
 the
 history
 of
 the


United
 States,
 largely
 fueled
 by
 what


some
 would
 argue
 is
 a
 a
 challenging


income
 growth
 situation,
 student
 loan


debt.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 a
 very
 different


situation
 than
 Venezuela,
 but
 many


middle
 class
 American
 children
 are


finding
 themselves
 unable
 to
 progress


like
 every
 generation
 before
 them.
 in
 US


history.
 They
 cannot
 seem
 to
 create
 a


better
 lives
 for
 themselves
 than
 their


parents.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 we
 are
 seeing
 in
 cities


like
 New
 York,
 Zoran
 Mdani
 being
 the


favorite
 to
 become
 mayor
 and


presidential
 candidates
 being
 discussed


that
 maybe
 also
 have
 a
 socialist
 agenda


and
 socialist
 interest.
 I
 want
 to
 give


you
 an
 opportunity
 to
 speak
 to
 the
 youth


of
 America
 about
 the
 lessons
 learned


with
 what
 Venezuela
 has
 gone
 through


with
 its
 socialist
 cycle
 here
 and
 maybe


something
 that
 you
 could
 share
 that


could
 help
 them
 think
 a
 little
 bit
 more


differently
 about
 the
 choices
 ahead
 for


the
 American
 democracy.


>> Yes.
 Um,
 we
 went
 through
 the
 same


experience,
 you
 know,
 26
 years
 ago.


People
 would
 warn
 us
 and
 say,
 you
 know,


watch
 out
 what
 socialism
 and
 communism


could
 bring
 to
 you.
 And
 we
 would
 always


answer,
 Venezuela
 is
 not
 Cuba.
 That's


not
 going
 to
 happen
 to
 us.
 And
 at
 the


end,
 look
 what,
 you
 know,
 the
 disaster


devastation.
 We
 had,
 you
 know,
 9
 million


of
 our
 people
 spread
 around
 the
 world.


and
 and
 the
 fact
 is
 that
 you
 can
 only


live
 in
 peace
 and
 prosperity
 if
 you
 have


freedom
 and
 and
 democracy.
 That's
 our


lesson.
 And
 and
 those
 who
 offer
 to
 give


you
 for
 free
 what
 you
 need
 to
 get
 on


your
 own
 with
 hard
 work
 at
 the
 end
 end


up
 you
 know
 charging
 you
 with
 the
 the


most
 valuable
 asset
 you
 could
 have
 which


is
 your
 freedom
 your
 capacity
 to
 decide


and
 to
 make
 your
 own
 decisions
 and
 um


that's
 that's
 a
 great
 lesson
 I
 mean
 when


you
 have
 the
 state
 on
 top
 of
 you
 h
 that


means
 whole
 society
 will
 probably
 be
 we


equal
 in
 misery
 and
 poverty.
 So
 I
 do


trust


the
 the
 American
 institutions
 and
 the


American
 spirit
 and
 American
 dream.
 And


I
 think
 these
 temptations
 come


uh
 many
 times
 and
 they
 they
 are
 good


because
 they
 make
 societies
 reflect
 on


what
 they
 have
 and
 understand
 that


previous
 freedom
 and
 democracy
 ought
 to


be
 defended,


taken
 care
 of
 every
 single
 day
 of
 your


life.
 when
 you
 lose
 it,
 it's
 very
 hard


to
 get
 it
 back.
 And
 and
 that's
 a
 lesson


we're
 going
 to
 give
 to
 our
 children
 and


our
 grandchildren.
 And
 I
 I
 believe
 uh


the
 American
 people
 values
 what
 they


have.
 And
 I
 hope
 that
 you
 know
 having
 so


many
 informed
 people
 around
 you
 can
 also


get
 you
 an
 idea
 of
 of
 of
 of
 the
 threats


and
 dangers
 of
 these
 systems.


Maria
 Karina,
 courage
 is
 speaking
 truth


to
 power.
 I
 cannot
 think
 of
 a
 more


powerful
 regime
 to
 speak
 truth
 to
 and
 I


thank
 you
 for
 your
 courage,
 for
 your


leadership.
 Congratulations
 on
 winning


the
 Nobel
 Peace
 Prize
 and
 thank
 you
 for


joining
 me
 here
 today.


>> Thank
 you.
 It
 was
 a
 pleasure
 and
 I
 look


forward
 to
 hosting
 you
 in
 a
 free


Venezuela
 where
 you
 will
 see,
 you
 know,


great
 investment,
 great
 prosperity
 and


also
 peace
 and
 freedom
 from
 Venezuela
 to


the
 rest
 of
 the
 region.
 Thank
 you
 so


much,
 David.


>> Thank
 you.

 going
