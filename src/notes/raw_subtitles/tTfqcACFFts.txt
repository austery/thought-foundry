 power
 of


Bloomberg
 data.


>> I'm
 Carol
 Masser
 along
 with
 Bailey


Lipsheltz.
 Let's
 get
 to
 some
 stocks
 on


the
 move
 today.
 Bloomberg
 News
 equities


reporter
 Natalya
 Kenny
 Javich
 is
 here
 in


studio.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 stocks
 on
 the


move.
 Where
 do
 you
 want
 to
 start?
 I


think
 I
 bet
 I
 know
 where
 you
 want
 to


start.
 Maybe
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 you
 want


to
 I


>> Papa
 John.


>> No,
 but
 I
 love
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 go


there.


>> All
 right,
 so
 let's
 start
 with
 Papa


John's.
 The
 ticker
 is
 PZZA.
 The
 stock


jumped
 as
 much
 as
 23%
 today,
 but
 closed


about
 10%
 higher.
 This
 is
 after
 Street


Insider
 reported
 that
 the
 pizza
 operator


received
 a
 $64
 per
 share
 bid
 from
 Apollo


Global
 Management.
 I
 have
 to
 point
 out


that
 the
 company
 declined
 to
 come
 into


Bloomberg,
 but
 sources
 told
 Street


Insider
 that
 the
 private
 equity
 firm
 has


been
 granted
 access
 to
 due
 diligence
 and


potential
 deal
 could
 come
 just
 in
 a
 few


weeks
 uh
 from
 now.
 Uh
 when
 I
 spoke
 with


one
 analyst
 and
 I
 asked
 like
 why
 would


it
 do
 it
 right
 now?
 He's
 like
 well
 first


of
 all
 everything
 has
 a
 price.
 The


company
 has
 been
 struggling.
 It's
 out


underperforming
 Domino's
 Pizza,


>> especially
 after
 Domino's
 started
 uh


collaborating
 with
 delivery
 services


like
 Door
 Dash,
 Uber,
 and
 potentially


probably
 it's
 more
 important
 that
 2024


was
 a
 really
 tough
 year
 for
 quick
 uh


restaurant
 services
 companies
 because


consumers
 are
 becoming
 more
 picky,


right?
 At
 the
 low
 end
 of
 the
 consumer


chain,


>> we
 got
 to
 make
 choices
 and
 maybe
 it


means
 no
 food
 delivery.


>> Yeah.
 a
 pandemic.
 Yes,
 definitely
 was
 a


great
 time.
 But
 then
 I
 looked
 at
 the


price
 uh
 stock
 price
 starting
 from


October
 2021,
 guys.
 Guess
 guess
 what?


It's
 down
 by
 63%.


>> Wow,
 that's
 a
 lot.


>> Even
 with
 today's
 move,
 it's
 only


recouping
 losses
 from
 like
 the
 last
 four


days.
 And
 Italy,
 I
 think
 it's


interesting,
 as
 you
 mentioned,
 if
 you


see
 a
 report
 that
 says
 $64
 and
 it
 closes


at
 46,
 I
 think
 investors
 aren't
 buying


it.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 I
 was
 surprised
 by
 that,


right,
 that
 it
 didn't
 even
 uh
 move
 up
 to


that.
 All
 right,
 let's
 go
 to
 LVS.


>> LVS,
 yes.
 Las
 Vegas
 sends
 the
 stock
 is


down
 by
 6%


just
 as
 other
 uh
 Macau
 casino
 operators.


It
 came
 as
 uh
 some
 industry
 reports


showed
 that
 uh
 demand
 for
 casinos
 was


weak.
 Uh
 particularly,
 I'm
 citing


Jeffrey's
 data.
 They
 said
 that
 demand


that
 includes
 the
 end
 of
 the
 golden
 week


holiday
 in
 China
 was
 lower
 than


expected.
 Macau
 gaming
 revenue
 for
 7


days
 ended
 on
 October
 12th
 was
 down
 46%


on
 a
 week-overweek
 basis.
 On
 a
 month
 of


today
 basis,
 it's
 also
 disappointing.
 Um


that
 implies
 about
 5%
 year-over-year


drop.
 So
 lots
 of
 concern.
 we
 see
 that


these
 stocks
 are
 under
 pressure


>> and
 you're
 also
 seeing
 it
 like
 Golden


Week
 is
 such
 a
 big
 event
 in
 Asia
 and
 if


people
 aren't
 leaving
 mainland
 China
 to


go
 gamble.
 The
 question
 comes
 back
 to


how
 is
 the
 health
 of
 the
 Chinese


consumer
 or
 the
 people
 at
 the
 top
 10%
 uh


if
 they
 aren't
 making
 those
 trips
 to
 I


don't
 know
 bet
 on
 horses
 and
 kind
 of
 do


everything
 else.
 Have
 you
 been
 to
 Macau?


>> No,
 I
 haven't.


>> Have
 you?


>> No.


>> No,
 I
 I
 was
 in
 Hong
 Kong
 but
 I
 didn't


make
 the
 trip.
 I
 was
 told
 it's
 a


glorified
 Vegas
 and
 I
 try
 to
 limit
 my


time
 in
 Vegas,
 but
 that's
 I
 digress.


Natalia,
 I
 think
 the
 stock
 that
 you
 want


to
 end
 on
 is
 the
 one
 that
 Carol
 thought


you
 start
 on.


>> Can
 I
 just
 say
 though,
 Las
 Vegas
 stands


like
 not
 all
 gaming
 companies
 or


gambling
 are
 the
 same,
 but
 they
 have


incred
 like
 their
 exposure
 to
 Macau
 is
 a


big
 one.
 So
 the
 China
 play
 is
 really


important
 for
 them.


>> Yeah.
 And
 we
 saw
 win
 under
 pressure.
 So


two
 of
 the
 three
 worst
 performers,
 we


talked
 about
 that
 on
 TV.
 Two
 of
 the


worst
 three
 performers
 in
 the
 SP500
 all


because
 of
 that
 exposure
 to
 Macau.


Anyway,
 back
 to
 the
 green.
 Yeah,


>> all
 roads
 lead
 back
 to
 today.


>> Broadcom
 Broadcom
 the
 ticker
 is
 AVGO.


The
 stock
 is
 up
 by
 10%
 I
 should
 say.
 Uh


9.88.
 Uh
 today,
 of
 course,
 it
 came
 after


OpenAI
 agreed
 to
 buy
 companies
 custom


chips
 and
 networking
 equipment.


>> I
 had
 a
 dollar
 for
 every
 time
 I
 said


Broadcom
 or
 OpenAI
 today.


>> I
 know.
 I
 know.
 Of
 course,
 it
 brings


more
 positive
 sentiment
 across
 AI's
 uh


names.
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 analysts


reaction.
 Here's
 what
 I
 found.
 So
 for


example,
 Millio's
 research
 set
 which
 has


140
 or
 excuse
 me
 415
 price
 target.
 The


stock
 is
 now
 trading
 at
 356.
 They
 said


that
 this
 deal
 would
 double
 AI
 revenue


in
 2026
 and
 then
 double
 again
 in
 2027.


However,
 when
 we
 look
 at
 pri
 today's


price
 reaction,
 vital
 knowledge
 analysts


said
 that
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 reasons
 why


this
 stock
 jumped
 after
 earnings
 report


is
 because
 Broadcom
 announced
 this


partnership
 with
 Open
 AI
 and
 they
 said,


it's
 a
 quote,
 it
 seems
 like
 the


announcement
 this
 morning
 is
 a
 little


bit
 recycled.
 So,
 investors
 knew
 that


there
 was
 a
 pact
 between
 the
 two


companies.
 W.
 Come
 on.
 How
 much
 time
 do


we
 devote
 talking
 to
 this?


>> I
 still
 want
 to
 know
 what
 happens
 if
 if


Open
 AI
 was
 public.
 Were
 the
 Would
 the


shares
 be
 up
 or
 down
 today?


>> I
 have
 no
 idea.


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 they're
 they're


spending.


>> We
 think
 they're
 we
 don't
 know
 who's


spending
 it.


>> You're
 right.
 We
 don't
 like
 this
 is
 this


is
 this
 vacuum
 that
 is
 AI
 and
 they
 are,


you
 know,
 kind
 of


>> the
 poster
 child
 of
 all
 of
 it.
 And
 it's


either
 going
 to
 be
 a
 massive
 win
 or
 I


don't
 know,
 it
 could
 end
 badly.
 And
 we


talked
 about
 it
 earlier.
 You're
 better


off
 being
 wrong
 when
 everyone
 else
 is


wrong
 than
 to
 be
 the
 one
 who
 sits
 it


out.
 Allah
 Intel.


>> Well,
 that's
 the
 bet,
 right?
 And
 that's


the
 risk
 right
 now.
