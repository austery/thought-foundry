Hello,
 Rebecca
 Jones
 here.
 Or
 should
 I


say
 Kia
 Order
 because
 you're
 about
 to


hear
 a
 special
 bonus
 episode
 recorded


live
 in
 Oakland,
 New
 Zealand
 earlier


this
 month.
 And
 yes,
 I
 know
 this
 is
 the


Australia
 podcast,
 but
 few
 economies
 are


as
 closely
 watched
 right
 now
 in
 this


region
 as
 New
 Zealand's.
 Our
 Pacific


neighbor
 is
 navigating
 inflationary


pressures,
 productivity
 challenges,
 and


a
 shifting
 global
 environment,
 which
 is


why
 the
 conversation
 you're
 about
 to


hear
 is
 such
 a
 timely
 one.
 New
 Zealand's


Minister
 for
 Finance
 and
 Deputy
 Leader


of
 the
 National
 Party,
 Nicola
 Willis,


was
 interviewed
 live
 on
 stage
 before
 a


packed
 room
 by
 our
 Wellington
 bureau


chief,
 Matthew
 Brockett.
 Here's
 what
 she


had
 to
 say.


I
 want
 to
 just
 reflect
 quickly
 on
 where


we
 are
 right
 now
 in
 the
 economic


landscape.
 Um,
 the
 economy
 is
 smaller


than
 it
 was
 when
 you
 took
 office.
 That's


a
 tough
 metric
 to
 confront
 for
 a


government
 that
 claims
 to
 be
 a
 better


economic
 manager
 than
 its
 predecessor.


What
 do
 you
 think's
 gone
 wrong?


Well,
 I
 think
 that
 it
 it
 will
 have
 gone


right
 by
 next
 year,
 Matthew,
 and
 that's


when
 the
 voters
 decide.
 Uh,
 and
 look,


when
 I
 yesterday,
 um,
 I
 shared
 with


Parliament
 that
 the
 IMF
 has
 done
 an


assessment
 of
 the
 output
 gap
 in
 various


countries
 around
 the
 world
 in
 2023.
 And


what
 that
 analysis
 shows
 is
 that
 New


Zealand
 was
 top
 of
 the
 pops,
 which
 is
 to


say
 in
 2023
 when
 the
 last
 government


left
 office,
 we
 had
 the
 most
 overheated


economy
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 that
 was
 off


the
 back
 of
 three
 years
 of
 inflation
 out


of
 band,
 an
 extremely
 rapid
 rise
 in


interest
 rates.
 And
 you
 know,
 a
 Reserve


Bank
 governor
 who
 was
 pretty
 upfront


about
 saying
 he
 was
 trying
 to
 engineer
 a


recession.
 So
 I
 don't
 think
 there
 should


be
 any
 surprise
 about
 the
 fact
 that
 we


have
 had
 a
 downturn
 and
 a
 difficult


recovery.
 that
 was
 anticipated.
 Um,
 our


job
 as
 a
 government
 is
 to
 reset
 the


foundation
 so
 that
 growth
 can
 return
 in


a
 sustainable
 way.
 Part
 of
 that
 is


getting
 the
 books
 back
 in
 healthy


condition.
 Part
 of
 that
 is
 putting
 in


place
 the
 reforms
 that
 will
 drive
 future


growth.
 Uh,
 and
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the


fundamentals,
 inflation
 uh,
 back
 in


band,
 interest
 rates
 coming
 down,
 uh,


we're
 there.
 As
 I
 say,
 we've
 had
 some


growth
 returning.
 We
 want
 to
 see
 that


sustained.
 All
 of
 my
 forecasters
 tell
 me


I
 should
 be
 confident.
 We
 you
 spoke


about
 the
 the
 the
 knock
 to
 confidence


from
 the
 US
 tariffs,
 but
 I
 just
 wonder


why
 New
 Zealand's
 confidence
 was
 knocked


that
 much.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 more
 than
 other


comparable
 countries.
 Is
 is
 the


government
 not
 have
 a
 role
 in
 in
 shoring


up
 confidence
 in
 times
 of
 that
 sort
 of


global
 uncertainty?


Well,
 look,
 I
 mean,
 it
 this
 is
 it


sentiment
 is
 notoriously
 hard
 to
 judge


and
 assess.
 My
 view
 is
 that
 we
 had
 only


just
 come
 into
 our
 recovery.
 As
 I
 say,


our
 cyclical
 recovery
 postco
 has
 been


marked
 by
 more
 challenges
 because
 our


inflation
 lasted
 longer
 and
 went
 higher


than
 in
 many
 other
 countries.
 Our


interest
 rates
 also
 spiked
 higher.
 There


are
 a
 number
 of
 factors
 that
 meant
 New


Zealand's
 recovery
 has
 been
 more


challenging.
 And
 off
 the
 back
 of
 that


and
 the
 confidence
 that
 that
 had
 sapped


uh
 with
 confidence
 only
 just
 returning,


uh
 my
 my
 basic
 sense
 it
 didn't
 take
 much


of
 a
 blow
 uh
 for
 people
 to
 go
 back
 into


their
 box.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 that
 was
 the


sort
 of
 behavior
 that
 you
 saw.
 We're


also,
 you
 know,
 one
 of
 uh
 the
 world's


great
 trading
 nations.
 One
 in
 four
 jobs


in
 this
 country
 depends
 on
 trade.
 Uh


we're
 not
 like
 uh
 some
 countries
 who
 who


actually
 do
 most
 of
 their
 economic


activity
 with
 themselves.
 We're
 highly


dependent
 on
 access
 to
 global
 markets.


And
 the
 idea
 of
 a
 US
 China
 trade
 war,
 I


think
 everyone
 in
 New
 Zealand
 knows
 that


that's
 not
 great
 for
 our
 country.


Okay.
 I
 think
 you
 alluded
 in
 your
 speech


to
 the
 idea
 that
 potentially
 that
 0.9%


contraction
 could
 be
 revised
 presumably


to
 something
 a
 bit
 smaller.
 What
 advice


have
 you
 had
 from
 Treasury
 around
 that?


Yeah,
 just
 simply
 that
 they've
 pointed


out
 to
 me
 that
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 of


years
 or
 so
 it
 has
 um
 become
 very


regular
 for
 stats
 to
 revise
 its


quarterly
 GDP
 data.
 And
 you
 can
 look


back
 on
 that
 and
 see
 that
 some
 of
 those


revisions
 have
 been
 reasonably


significant
 to
 and
 to
 defend
 stats.
 Um


that
 has
 actually
 occurred
 around
 the


world
 to
 some
 extent
 that
 getting
 back


to
 um
 seasonal
 patterns
 postco
 and


measuring
 that
 stats
 data
 is
 challenging


and
 you've
 seen
 a
 number
 of


jurisdictions
 find
 that
 um
 survey


techniques
 are
 having
 to
 evolve.
 Uh
 so
 I


don't
 think
 stats
 and
 zed
 is
 unusual
 in


that
 sense
 but
 we
 certainly
 uh
 have
 seen


significant
 revisions
 to
 the
 quarterly


data.
 There
 are
 some
 technical
 factors


which
 I'm
 not
 even
 sure
 this
 audience


would
 be
 up
 for
 understanding
 but
 to
 do


with
 the
 top
 down
 adjustment
 and
 the
 the


seasonality
 of
 the
 Q2
 quarter
 versus
 the


Q4
 data
 and
 Treasury
 have
 briefed
 me
 on


those
 things
 and
 said
 look
 taken


together
 all
 you
 need
 to
 know
 is
 don't


be
 surprised
 uh
 if
 there
 is
 a
 revision


to
 this
 and
 the
 Reserve
 Bank
 clearly


pointed
 to
 that
 in
 their
 statement


yesterday
 as
 well.


Do
 you
 want
 to
 take
 a
 stab
 at
 what
 it


might
 be
 revised
 to?


No,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 that.


You're
 saying
 now
 that
 the
 worst
 is


behind
 us.
 I
 I
 just
 want
 to
 quickly


touch
 on
 the
 NZIR's
 um
 business
 survey


business
 survey
 that
 came
 out
 this
 week


because
 that
 was
 quite
 downbeat.
 Um


notably
 investment
 intentions
 were


sharply
 lower.
 A
 net
 13%
 of
 firms


expecting
 to
 reduce
 spending
 on
 plant


and
 machinery
 over
 the
 coming
 year
 and


that
 must
 be
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 concern


particularly
 after
 your
 investment
 boost


in
 the
 in
 this
 year's
 budget.


Yeah,
 look,
 we've
 always
 said
 that


investment
 boost
 is
 a
 policy
 for
 the


medium
 and
 long
 term.
 It's
 not
 a
 it's


not
 a
 stimulus
 response.
 We
 don't
 think


the
 fiscal
 stimulus
 is
 required
 from
 the


government
 at
 this
 juncture.
 The
 Reserve


Bank
 uh
 is
 doing
 the
 is
 doing
 the


lifting
 on
 stimulus.
 Uh
 but
 it's


actually
 about
 uh
 the
 productivity


settings
 and
 so
 uh
 firms
 know
 it's
 there


uh
 and
 are
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 take
 it


up
 and
 on
 the
 margin
 we
 do
 expect
 it


will
 bring
 some
 investment
 decisions


over
 the
 line
 that
 wouldn't
 have


otherwise
 happened.
 you
 know
 the
 the


NZIER
 survey
 you
 refer
 to
 is
 interesting


and
 that
 it's
 not
 as
 exposed
 to


agriculture
 as
 some
 of
 the
 other
 surveys


and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 significant
 because


we
 are
 very
 much
 seeing
 uh
 that
 the


agricultural
 part
 of
 the
 economy
 uh
 is


doing
 very
 well
 uh
 that
 is
 where
 you
 are


seeing
 not
 only
 uh
 good
 returns
 but


certainly
 for
 the
 dairy
 sector
 they're


looking
 ahead
 uh
 potentially
 to
 an


additional
 dividend
 next
 year
 uh
 and


you're
 seeing
 a
 sense
 that
 those
 returns


will
 be
 sustained
 across
 large
 parts
 of


the
 agricultural
 sector
 with
 the
 highest


terms
 of
 trade
 we've
 had
 since
 the
 50s.


So
 that
 means
 that
 you
 are
 seeing
 uh


different
 things
 happening
 in
 different


parts
 of
 the
 economy.
 That
 survey
 isn't


picking
 up
 on
 the
 egg
 and
 I
 think
 if
 it


was
 it
 would
 paint
 a
 more
 positive


picture.
 Equally
 the
 own
 activity


measures
 in
 that
 survey
 show
 that


people's
 reported
 actual
 activity
 uh
 is


getting
 better.


Okay.
 You
 you
 mentioned
 stimulus
 there


briefly.
 Of
 course
 we
 do
 have
 an


election
 next
 year.
 You're
 going
 to
 want


the
 economy
 to
 be
 growing
 by
 then.
 Um,


are
 you
 planning
 any
 specific
 stimulus


measures
 going
 into
 the
 next
 year?


No,
 we're
 going
 to
 stick
 to
 our
 fiscal


plan
 because
 we
 were
 elected
 very


clearly
 on
 a
 platform
 uh
 that
 after
 some


years
 of
 what
 we
 would
 characterize
 as


very
 reckless
 economic
 and
 fiscal


management
 which
 allowed
 debt
 uh
 to
 soar


in
 a
 way
 uh
 that
 was
 quite
 unprecedented


and
 allowed
 a
 structural
 deficit
 to
 be


put
 in
 place
 with
 spending
 reaching
 very


high
 levels.
 in
 a
 wasteful
 way
 that
 part


of
 what
 we
 were
 elected
 to
 do
 was
 re
 uh


was
 reset
 those
 foundations
 to
 have


fiscal
 responsibility
 back
 to
 get
 the


books
 back
 in
 balance
 and
 so
 that's
 part


of
 our
 handshake
 with
 the
 New
 Zealand


people
 and
 to
 do
 that
 um
 we've
 got
 to


stick
 to
 the
 fiscal
 strategy
 and
 we're


confident
 that
 we
 can
 do
 that
 while


continuing
 to
 invest
 in
 the
 public


services
 which
 uh
 we've
 also
 committed


to
 do
 a
 better
 job
 on
 whether
 that's
 in


health
 or
 education
 our
 police
 uh
 and


we've
 demonstrated
 that
 we
 can
 do
 that


over
 the
 past
 two
 budgets.
 By
 delivering


$43
 billion
 of
 savings
 from
 uh
 less


efficient
 parts
 of
 the
 crown,
 we
 have


been
 able
 to
 then
 release
 investment
 to


to
 education,
 to
 health,
 uh
 to
 other


critical
 areas
 and
 it
 will
 be
 the
 same


in
 next
 year's
 budget.


Well,
 you
 are
 constrained
 by
 the
 fiscal


situation.
 The
 budget
 deficit
 is


forecast
 to
 widen
 to
 12
 billion
 in
 the


current
 year.
 That's
 2.6%
 of
 GDP.
 Um,
 do


you
 still
 expect
 to
 be
 able
 to
 return


the
 budget
 to
 surplus
 in
 2028?


Yes.
 Yes,
 we
 do.
 Uh,
 we
 we
 we
 continue


to
 have
 that
 intention.
 That
 continues


to
 be
 our
 fiscal
 goal.
 Uh,
 how
 that
 will


actually
 play
 out
 will
 fluctuate
 over
 a


series
 of
 forecasts.
 But
 what
 we've
 set


out
 in
 our
 budget
 plan
 is
 a
 gradual


consolidation
 path.
 And
 uh
 all
 of
 the


advice
 that
 I've
 received
 is
 well
 yeah


uh
 in
 a
 technical
 sense
 you
 could


suddenly
 just
 rip
 a
 whole
 heck
 of


spending
 out
 and
 get
 yourself
 back
 into


balance
 immediately.
 Actually
 the
 way


that
 you
 would
 have
 to
 do
 that
 would


probably
 uh
 be
 through
 transfers
 that
 is


um
 social
 welfare
 support
 or


superanuation
 support
 because
 that's


where
 the
 bulk
 of
 adjustable
 spending


lies.
 And
 when
 you
 do
 that
 in
 one
 fell


swoop,
 that
 can
 actually
 have
 extremely


negative
 impacts
 on
 both
 economic
 growth


and
 economic
 sentiment.
 Not
 to
 mention


the
 fact
 we
 don't
 have
 a
 mandate
 for


that
 from
 the
 people
 who
 elected
 us.
 So


I
 don't
 think
 that
 would
 be
 the
 right


thing
 to
 do
 and
 we
 have
 set
 out


confidently
 that
 we
 can
 achieve
 fiscal


consolidation
 over
 the
 medium
 term


consistent
 with
 what
 the
 experts
 tell
 us


is
 needed.
 Um,
 and
 look,
 you
 know,
 the


best
 way
 of
 reviewing
 whether
 I'm


telling
 the
 truth
 there
 is
 the
 ratings


agencies
 and
 they
 retain
 confidence
 uh


in
 our
 plan.
 They
 think
 that
 this


remains
 a
 good
 credit
 risk
 of
 a
 country.


They've
 rated
 us
 highly
 uh
 and
 say
 as


long
 as
 we
 stick
 to
 that
 plan,
 we're
 all


good.


Of
 course,
 the
 ratings
 agencies
 also


like
 US
 subprime
 debt.
 But
 um
 let's
 move


on
 to
 net
 debt.
 Um


there's
 a
 cherry
 chair.


I
 just
 want
 to
 briefly
 touch
 on
 debt.


Um,
 it's
 currently
 about
 42%
 of
 GDP.
 You


want
 to
 reduce
 it
 to
 less
 than
 40%.
 Um,


it's
 forecast
 to
 increase
 to
 46%
 in
 the


next
 couple
 of
 years.
 Those
 are


historically
 high
 numbers
 and
 the


Treasury
 is
 warning
 that
 it'll
 keep


rising,
 in
 fact,
 going
 to
 200%
 of
 GDP
 by


2065,
 unless
 something's
 done
 to
 address


the
 pressures
 of
 the
 aging
 and
 aging


population.
 And
 I
 wonder
 what
 you
 see
 as


being
 necessary
 to
 stop
 that
 from


happening.
 First
 I
 just
 want
 to
 address


a
 few
 things
 in
 your
 question
 slech.
 Um


the
 the
 first
 of
 all
 debt
 is
 forecast
 to


grow
 uh
 and
 before
 it
 comes
 back
 down
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 forecast
 period
 before
 we


bend
 it
 down.
 But
 it
 is
 of
 note
 I
 think


that
 when
 we
 saw
 the
 full
 accounts
 for


the
 year
 which
 we
 published
 yesterday
 we


were
 forecasting
 an
 increase
 to
 debt
 but


actually
 debt
 held
 level.
 My
 point
 here


is
 yes
 we're
 forecasting
 that
 but
 we're


always
 aiming
 to
 do
 better.
 The
 second


thing
 is
 you're
 absolutely
 right
 that
 uh


Treasury
 have
 said
 very
 clearly
 that


anything
 above
 50%
 debt
 in
 New
 Zealand


due
 to
 our
 small
 exposed
 nature
 and
 the


price
 we
 already
 pay
 for
 debt
 would


expose
 us
 uh
 if
 we
 were
 to
 have
 any
 kind


of
 a
 shock
 uh
 and
 would
 not
 be
 a
 prudent


place
 to
 be
 and
 we
 accept
 their
 advice


on
 that
 and
 think
 that
 it
 is
 important


to
 get
 back
 into
 a
 more
 prudent
 debt


position.
 As
 we
 look
 ahead,
 Treasury


have
 done
 their
 40
 years
 from
 now.
 If


nothing
 changes,
 if
 no
 government


decides
 to
 do
 anything
 differently,
 what


might
 happen?
 And
 frankly,
 I
 just
 think


that's
 a
 theoretical
 exercise
 that
 has


no
 bearing
 on
 reality
 because


governments
 have
 proven
 uh
 that
 they
 do


react
 to
 the
 um
 circumstances
 in
 front


of
 them.
 uh
 you
 know
 a
 couple
 of
 key


issues
 for
 New
 Zealand
 uh
 superanuation


and
 uh
 health
 and
 those
 are
 the
 two


areas
 that
 are
 going
 to
 drive
 future


public
 expenditure


uh
 I
 think
 all
 parties
 uh
 have
 a
 uh


requirement
 to
 go
 into
 the
 next
 election


with
 a
 policy
 setting
 out
 uh
 where


they're
 at
 on
 superanuation
 because
 as


we
 all
 know
 these
 are
 very
 longheld
 uh


things
 and
 we
 need
 to
 signal
 very


clearly
 very
 much
 ahead
 of
 people
 uh
 who


are
 who
 aren't
 even
 thinking
 about


retiring
 ing
 now
 what
 those
 settings


will
 look
 like.
 Uh
 we
 um
 we
 as
 a
 party


uh
 have
 proposed
 changes
 in
 this
 area
 in


the
 past.
 We
 haven't
 committed
 to


whether
 we
 would
 make
 changes
 in
 the


future.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think
 we
 have
 shown
 our


hand
 at
 this
 recent
 budget
 by
 increasing


those
 contributions
 to
 Kiwi
 Saver.
 Uh


which
 shows
 a
 commitment
 I
 think
 from


all
 three
 parties
 in
 the
 coalition
 that


that
 is
 an
 important
 vehicle
 uh
 for
 New


Zealand's
 future
 savings.


U
 yeah
 leave
 it
 there.
 What
 about
 new


revenue
 streams?
 That's
 something
 which


uh
 Treasury
 has
 also
 highlighted.
 Do
 you


see
 a
 need
 for
 any
 new
 revenue
 streams?


It
 was
 interesting.
 We
 recently
 had
 a


tax
 expert
 visit
 New
 Zealand
 and
 I
 had


him
 come
 into
 my
 office
 and
 I
 said,


"Well,
 how
 do
 we
 look
 relative
 to
 the


rest
 of the
 world?"
 And
 he
 said,
 "Like,


you're
 really
 good.
 You've
 got
 a
 really


great
 system
 in
 that
 you've
 you're
 a


poster
 child
 for
 having
 resisted
 the


political
 urge
 to
 fiddle
 with
 your
 GST.


It's
 very
 clean.
 You
 haven't
 introduced


exemptions
 and
 um
 problems
 like
 that.
 it


works
 is
 a
 really
 efficient
 uh
 revenue


system.
 Your
 PAE
 system
 looks
 pretty


good.
 Uh
 you've
 got
 the
 uh
 corporate


system
 looking
 pretty
 good.
 It
 it
 works


pretty
 well.
 It's
 a
 clean
 system.
 And
 so


uh
 our
 our
 view
 is
 when
 you
 look
 at
 um


when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 tax
 system,
 you


want
 it
 to
 be
 efficient.
 You
 don't
 want


it
 to
 send
 distorting
 uh
 signals.
 You


want
 it
 to
 raise
 sufficient
 revenue.
 Um,


but
 we
 will
 always
 be
 looking
 at
 it
 to


say,
 well,
 given
 our
 goal
 is
 to
 be
 more


competitive
 internationally,
 given
 our


goal
 is
 for
 New
 Zealanders
 to
 be
 get
 to


get
 ahead
 uh
 and
 to
 pursue
 aspiration


and
 achievement,
 we
 should
 be


continuously
 asking
 ourselves,
 could


these
 settings
 better
 support
 that.


We'll
 be
 right
 back
 for
 part
 two
 of
 New


Zealand
 Finance
 Minister
 Nicola
 Willis


in
 conversation
 with
 Bloomberg's
 Matthew


Brockett.
 This
 is
 the
 Bloomberg


Australia
 podcast.


[Music]


and
 welcome
 back
 to
 the
 Bloomberg


Australia
 podcast.
 You're
 listening
 to


an
 extract
 of
 Wellington
 Bureau
 Chief


Matthew
 Brockett
 in
 conversation
 with


New
 Zealand
 Finance
 Minister
 Nicola


Willis
 recorded
 before
 a
 live
 audience


in
 Oakland
 earlier
 this
 month.


What
 about
 a
 capital
 gains
 tax?


That's
 never
 been
 on
 our
 agenda.


I
 mean,
 why
 not?


New
 Zealand
 is
 an
 outlier
 in
 the
 OECD


and
 not
 having
 one.
 Well,
 the
 first


reason
 why
 not
 is
 the
 parties
 that
 want


to
 raise
 a
 capital
 gains
 tax
 will
 also


want
 to
 waste
 the
 money
 on
 something


else.
 And
 uh
 typically
 we've
 seen
 that


Labor
 governments
 that
 have
 spent
 more


have
 not
 put
 that
 spending
 into


productive
 investment.
 We've
 seen
 it
 uh


in
 fact
 been
 uh
 used
 in
 a
 in
 a
 wasteful


way.
 But
 the
 second
 reason
 uh
 is
 that


capital
 gains
 taxes
 uh
 very
 clearly
 send


a
 message
 that
 those
 who
 invest
 in


capital
 and
 gain
 from
 capital
 will
 be


punished
 for
 it.
 And
 we're
 sending
 a


really
 strong
 message
 we
 actually
 want


more
 investment
 in
 New
 Zealand.
 We


actually
 want
 more
 capital
 growth
 to


occur.
 Uh
 and
 it's
 it's
 very
 hard
 for
 me


to
 reconcile
 how
 you
 say
 on
 the
 one
 hand


we're
 going
 to
 tax
 returns
 on
 capital


but
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 we
 really
 want
 you


investing
 capital
 and
 making
 greater


returns
 on
 capital.
 So,
 it's
 just
 not


consistent
 with
 our
 worldview,
 which
 is


let's
 make
 this
 a
 better
 place
 to


invest,
 not
 make
 it
 harder.


Well,
 I
 I'll
 just
 push
 back
 on
 that
 just


a
 little
 bit.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 no
 strong


evidence
 that
 taxing
 capital
 gains


actually
 drives
 capital
 away.
 And
 I


mean,
 if
 everyone
 else
 has
 got
 a
 capital


gains
 tax,
 then
 where
 is
 it
 going
 to
 go?


And
 secondly,
 it
 gives
 them
 another


reason
 to
 go.
 And
 you
 know,
 I'm
 very


reflective
 about
 this,
 which
 is
 we've


got
 this
 big
 brother
 over
 there
 called


Australia,
 and
 we
 have
 very
 free
 flows


of
 people
 in
 capital
 between
 New
 Zealand


and
 Australia.
 And
 our
 advantages
 are


not
 absolute.
 We
 have
 many,
 it's
 a
 much


better
 place
 to
 live
 here.
 But
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 does
 matter
 is
 things


like
 Australia
 has
 a
 capital
 tax,
 a


capital
 gains
 regime,
 and
 we
 don't.
 And


on
 the
 margin,
 yes,
 that's
 of
 advantage


to
 us.
 Do
 we
 want
 to
 keep
 giving
 away


every
 single
 area
 of
 advantage
 that
 we


have?
 My
 answer
 is
 no.


Okay.
 Um,
 as
 we're
 on
 the
 housing
 market


broadly,
 um,
 you
 know,
 I
 just
 want
 to


ask
 for
 your
 views
 on
 this
 because
 it


plays
 an
 important
 part
 in
 terms
 of


economic
 growth
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 the


wealth
 effect
 which
 we
 currently
 not


having
 at
 the
 moment.
 Um,
 your
 colleague


Chris
 Bishop
 is
 on
 record
 of
 saying
 he


wants
 house
 prices
 to
 fall
 and
 they
 have


been
 falling,
 but
 that
 makes
 your
 job


harder.
 What
 would
 you
 like
 to
 see
 in


the
 housing
 market?


Well,
 I
 want
 to
 see
 a
 much
 more
 moderate


uh
 house
 price
 growth
 than
 we
 have
 seen


in
 the
 past.
 So,
 there's
 two
 issues.
 The


first
 issue
 uh
 is
 that
 we
 saw
 a
 massive


spike
 in
 house
 prices
 in
 New
 Zealand


postco
 essentially
 a
 30%
 house
 price


growth
 in
 one
 year
 and
 then
 we've


basically
 seen
 uh
 an
 asset
 bubble
 crash


which
 is
 that
 that's
 come
 off
 the
 other


side
 uh
 and
 of
 course
 that's
 at
 a
 huge


knock
 uh
 to
 household
 confidence
 uh
 and


um
 has
 really
 been
 a
 kick
 in
 the
 guts


for
 for
 many
 New
 Zealanders.
 So
 I
 think


that
 has
 absolutely
 uh
 affected
 the


recovery
 that
 we're
 having.
 What
 we
 want


to
 see
 and
 indeed
 what
 Treasury
 is


forecasting
 is
 that
 in
 the
 future
 there


will
 be
 moderate
 house
 price
 growth
 but


in
 a
 system
 that
 allows
 supply
 to


respond
 to
 demand
 because
 historically


what
 we've
 seen
 in
 New
 Zealand
 is


periods
 of
 extremely
 high
 house
 price


growth
 simply
 because
 demand
 was
 higher


for
 housing
 but
 the
 market
 was


completely
 unable
 to
 respond
 on
 the


supply
 side.
 Why?
 Because
 our
 resource


consent
 settings
 didn't
 allow
 developers


to
 get
 the
 consent
 for
 the
 developments


they
 might
 have
 wanted
 wanted
 to
 do.
 So


they
 could
 see
 the
 signal
 in
 the
 market,


house
 prices
 are
 going
 up
 high.
 Let's


get
 in
 there
 and
 build
 some
 houses
 to


respond
 to
 that.
 But
 there
 was
 a
 huge


timing
 delay
 between
 the
 market
 showing


that
 and
 then
 being
 able
 to
 uh
 respond


with
 supply.
 So
 we're
 changing
 the


settings.
 And
 what
 Chris
 Bishop
 is


intent
 on
 is
 he
 wants
 the
 market
 to
 work


so
 that
 if
 we
 are
 seeing
 spikes
 in


demand,
 people
 can
 get
 out
 and
 supply


the
 housing.
 But
 both
 he
 and
 I
 agree


we're
 going
 to
 see
 moderate
 house
 price


growth
 in
 the
 future.


Okay,
 let's
 move
 on
 to
 the
 Reserve
 Bank


which
 has
 been
 dominating
 headlines
 this


year
 for
 all
 kinds
 of
 reasons.
 Um


firstly,
 do
 you
 think
 it
 made
 a
 policy


mistake?
 I
 mean
 it
 paused
 in
 its
 rate


cuts
 earlier
 this
 year
 and
 now
 it's


cutting
 by
 50
 basis
 points.
 Did
 they
 did


they
 fail
 to
 recognize
 that
 the
 economy


was
 in
 a
 hole?


Well,
 I
 have
 the
 good
 grace
 not
 to


comment
 on
 whether
 or
 not
 they
 have


succeeded
 or
 failed
 and
 in
 return
 they


have
 the
 good
 grace
 to
 do
 the
 same
 for


me.
 Okay.


Um,
 you've
 appointed
 a
 new
 Reserve
 Bank


governor.


Anna
 Braymond,
 currently
 deputy
 governor


of
 Sweden's
 Rick's
 Bank,
 will
 be
 the


first
 woman
 to
 help
 in
 the
 RBN
 Zed.
 Now,


I
 know
 you
 said
 that
 gender
 wasn't
 a


consideration
 in
 that
 appointment,
 but
 I


wonder
 how
 important
 it
 was
 for
 you
 to


break
 that
 glass
 ceiling.


Well,
 I
 think
 it's
 significant
 uh
 for


New
 Zealand.
 Uh
 having
 um
 been
 appointed


to
 a
 role
 where
 uh
 there's
 only
 been


another
 woman
 previously,
 I
 know
 that


it's
 very
 undermining
 if
 people
 suggest


that
 the
 reason
 you're
 in
 that
 role
 is


because
 of
 your
 gender.
 And
 I
 did
 not


want
 that
 for
 Dr.
 Braymond
 at
 the
 point


of
 her
 appointment.
 That
 was
 very


important
 to
 me.
 She
 is
 absolutely
 there


on
 her
 merits.
 uh
 she
 has
 a
 CV
 from


central
 banking
 central
 casting
 and


she's
 an
 extraordinarily
 impressive


person
 but
 there
 is
 just
 no
 question
 uh


when
 our
 when
 our
 daughters
 but
 actually


when
 women
 across
 the
 country
 see
 that


there
 is
 no
 office
 in
 this
 country
 that


cannot
 be
 occupied
 by
 a
 woman
 uh
 that


has
 a
 galvanizing
 and
 positive
 effect.


Okay.
 In
 her
 initial
 remarks
 Braymond


spoke
 about
 enhancing
 transparency
 at


the
 RBNZ.
 The
 Rick's
 Bank
 is
 uh
 more


progressive
 on
 that
 front
 than
 than
 our


central
 bank
 in
 terms
 of
 things
 like


attributing
 votes
 to
 members
 of
 the


rates
 sitting
 committee,
 holding
 a
 press


conference
 after
 each
 rate
 decision
 and


so
 on.
 I
 wonder
 if
 you
 see
 her


appointment
 as
 an
 opportunity
 to


introduce
 transfer
 transparency
 reforms.


Great
 question
 and
 the
 answer
 is
 yes.


Yes.
 Yes.


Okay.
 What
 what
 kind
 of
 reforms
 I
 mean


would
 you
 for
 example
 favor
 that
 votes


being
 attributed
 on
 the
 monetary
 policy


committee?
 Well,
 look,
 I'm
 going
 to


leave
 it
 uh
 until
 Dr.
 Braymond
 has


actually
 formally
 commenced
 her
 role
 and


is
 able
 to
 have
 those
 discussions
 with


her
 own
 board
 and
 then
 I
 will
 have
 those


discussions
 with
 them
 about
 where
 we


take
 that
 because
 obviously
 those
 are


decisions
 that
 we
 will
 consider


together.
 Uh
 but
 both
 me
 and
 Dr.


Braymond
 independently
 have
 said
 that
 we


think
 central
 banks
 should
 be
 committed


to
 uh
 public
 transparency
 and


accountability
 uh
 because
 it
 builds


trust
 and
 that
 is
 actually
 essential
 to


the
 way
 in
 which
 central
 banks
 operate


and
 where
 we
 have
 a
 choice
 in
 the


settings
 that
 we
 think
 ultimately
 will


build
 trust
 and
 build
 accountability
 uh


then
 I
 think
 we
 are
 duty
 bound
 to


consider
 those
 changes.
 So
 there
 are


always
 uh
 trade-offs
 and
 um
 balances
 to


be
 made
 and
 so
 all
 of
 these
 things
 need


to
 be
 considered
 carefully.
 But
 as
 you


point
 out
 there
 are
 monetary
 policy


regimes
 around
 the
 world
 which
 are


radically
 more
 transparent
 than
 ours.


Ours
 is
 still
 at
 the
 transparent
 end
 of


the
 spectrum.
 But
 of
 course
 there's


other
 improvements
 we
 could
 make.


But
 just
 to
 be
 clear,
 would
 you
 support


the
 attribution
 of
 votes
 on
 the
 MPC?


Well,
 as
 I
 say,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 make
 a


judgment
 on
 that
 until
 Dr.
 Breamman


together
 with
 her
 board
 haven't
 had
 an


opportunity
 to
 consider
 it.
 But
 I
 do


think
 it's
 been
 very
 positive
 actually


to
 have
 the
 record
 of
 split
 votes
 over


recent
 OCR
 decisions
 because
 it
 just


informs
 the
 market
 better
 about
 what's


happening.
 But
 I
 also
 think
 it's
 healthy


that
 you
 get
 the
 odds
 split
 decision
 on


the
 MPC


because
 what
 it
 demonstrates
 is
 they
 are


having
 robust
 debates
 around
 that
 table


and
 are
 seeing
 the
 balanced
 things.
 It's


not
 group
 think.
 It's
 not
 one
 person


deciding
 and
 telling
 the
 others
 what
 to


think
 that
 there
 is
 a
 range
 of
 views


being
 shared
 and
 being
 brought
 to
 the


table.
 I
 think
 that
 is
 actually
 a


healthy
 thing
 and
 not
 to
 be
 feared


since
 its
 formation
 in
 2019.
 Um
 the
 MPC


we've
 seen
 external
 members
 uh
 join
 that


and
 they've
 been
 almost
 completely


invisible.
 I
 mean
 I
 can
 count
 on
 one


hand
 the
 number
 of
 times
 they've
 engaged


publicly
 or
 with
 the
 media.
 Is
 that


acceptable?
 Do
 you
 think
 there
 should
 be


a
 bit
 more
 accountability
 there?
 I
 mean


these
 are
 people
 deciding
 on
 interest


rates
 that
 affect
 the
 whole
 country.


Ah
 well
 look
 there's
 nothing
 to
 stop


them
 from
 doing
 that.
 There's
 nothing


preventing
 them
 from
 doing
 that.
 Uh
 and


I
 I
 think
 the
 the
 reality
 is
 that
 the
 um


that
 the
 MPC
 speaks
 via
 its
 statements


and
 there's
 always
 uh
 some
 uh
 desire
 not


to
 confuse
 the
 market
 with
 people
 out


saying
 different
 things
 in
 between


updates.
 So
 that
 probably
 bears
 on
 some


of
 uh
 their
 approach
 to
 it.
 There's


absolutely
 nothing
 to
 stop
 them
 right


now.


But
 they're
 not
 doing
 it.


Yeah.


Yeah.
 Okay.
 What
 about
 just
 just


finally,
 what
 about
 a
 press
 conference


after
 each
 rate
 decision
 as
 as
 the


Rick's
 bank
 does?
 I
 mean,
 would
 that
 be


something
 that
 you
 would
 be
 in
 favor
 of?


Look,
 as
 I
 say,
 these
 are
 all
 the


there's
 a
 there's
 actually
 a
 a
 laundry


list
 of
 ideas
 uh
 that
 Dr.
 Braymond
 and


the
 board
 may
 wish
 to
 consider.
 I
 don't


think
 our
 system
 is
 broken.
 I
 think
 it


actually
 works
 fairly
 well.
 those
 who


are
 market
 participants
 tell
 me
 uh
 that


they
 feel
 they
 get
 good
 and
 clear


information
 out
 of
 the
 official
 cash


rate
 decisions.
 Um
 and
 so
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 it's
 not
 not


working.
 But
 if
 there
 are
 incremental


improvements
 we
 can
 make
 and
 there
 are


many
 we
 could
 consider.
 Uh
 then
 we


should
 and
 each
 of
 those
 will
 come
 with


some
 some
 pros
 and
 some
 cons
 and
 we'll


need
 to
 weigh
 that
 up.
 Um,
 I'll
 have
 a


view,
 the
 Treasury
 will
 have
 a
 view,
 the


RBNZ
 will
 have
 a
 view,
 and
 together


we'll
 weigh
 that
 up,
 and
 I'll
 and
 I'll


respect
 that
 process
 by
 waiting
 until


the
 right
 time.


Okay.
 Just
 this
 week,
 we
 we
 we
 saw
 news


that
 the
 former
 governor
 was
 paid
 a


restraint
 of
 trade
 payment
 of
 over


$400,000.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 looked
 a
 bit


untidy
 this
 whole
 saga,
 and
 I
 just


wonder
 whether
 you've,
 you
 know,
 felt


that
 it's
 um
 undermined
 um
 the


reputation
 of
 the
 Reserve
 Bank
 in
 any


way.
 Well,
 well,
 look,
 ultimately
 the


chairperson
 of
 the
 Reserve
 Bank
 did


resign,
 and
 I
 think
 that
 ultimately
 uh


reflected
 uh
 his
 decision,
 but
 also
 our


uh
 discussion
 that
 we
 wanted
 to
 protect


the
 reputation
 of
 the
 Reserve
 Bank.
 And


I've
 made
 absolutely
 no
 bones
 about
 the


fact
 that
 I
 don't
 think
 uh
 they
 had


managed
 that
 episode
 well
 and
 that
 they


should
 have
 been
 much
 more
 open
 and


transparent
 in
 the
 way
 that
 they
 handled


questions
 uh
 seeking
 information
 about


that
 matter.
 I
 always
 thought
 very


properly
 I
 think
 uh
 to
 not
 have
 uh
 the


role
 as
 the
 commentator
 and
 chief
 on
 the


employment
 agreement
 between
 the


governor
 and
 the
 board.
 I
 thought
 it
 was


very
 dangerous
 for
 the
 minister
 to
 step


into
 uh
 that
 dispute
 in
 any
 way
 uh
 and


dis
 absolutely
 distanced
 myself
 from
 it


uh
 and
 then
 thought
 having
 not
 been
 a


party
 to
 it
 I
 must
 rely
 on
 the
 board
 to


communicate
 about
 it
 because
 otherwise
 I


am
 inferring
 and
 making
 inference
 and


commentary
 on
 something
 which
 I'm
 not


actually
 a
 party
 uh
 to
 with
 that
 has
 all


of
 the
 information
 uh
 with
 bearing
 and


so
 what
 that
 requires
 for
 it
 to
 work
 is


for
 the
 Reserve
 Bank
 to
 then
 communicate


openly
 ly
 and
 transparently
 and


unfortunately
 they
 haven't
 always
 met


that
 mark.


Okay,
 we
 are
 getting
 close
 to
 the
 time


for
 the
 Q&A
 but
 I
 just
 I
 wanted
 to


finish
 our
 discussion
 with
 just
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 a
 conversation
 about
 what
 it's


like
 to
 have
 your
 job.
 Um
 you
 know
 a
 lot


of
 people
 look
 at
 parliament
 and


politics
 and
 think
 that
 would
 be
 the


last
 job
 they'd
 want
 to
 do.
 Um
 you
 work


extremely
 long
 hours,
 you
 face
 a
 lot
 of


criticism
 and
 you
 know
 just
 this
 week


we've
 seen
 people
 throwing
 rocks
 through


politicians
 windows.
 What?
 Why
 do
 you


want
 to
 be
 in
 politics?


Because
 I
 genuinely
 want
 to
 serve
 and


make
 a
 difference.
 I
 am
 one
 of
 those
 New


Zealanders
 who
 has
 been
 fortunate
 enough


to
 get
 a
 great
 education,
 to
 have
 a


great
 mom
 and
 dad,
 to
 have
 the


opportunities
 this
 country
 provides.


And
 I
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 more
 people


get
 that.
 Uh,
 I
 want
 to
 make
 the
 country


better
 and
 I've
 also
 got
 four
 kids
 and


they're
 aged
 nine
 through
 15
 and
 I
 worry


that
 if
 New
 Zealand
 sits
 back
 and
 none


of
 us
 stand
 up
 to
 make
 the
 changes
 that


are
 needed,
 none
 of
 us
 stand
 up
 to
 say


let's
 actually
 make
 sure
 the
 government


works,
 none
 of
 us
 stand
 up
 and
 say
 we


actually
 need
 to
 change
 some
 things
 and


make
 some
 reforms
 and
 do
 better.
 Then


all
 my
 kids
 will
 say,
 "Well,
 New


Zealand's
 going
 backwards.
 I'm
 going
 to


go
 and
 live
 in
 London
 or
 Beijing
 or


Singapore
 and
 I'd
 quite
 like
 to
 have


Christmas
 here


into
 the
 future.
 So,
 I
 feel
 well,
 I've


had
 everything
 I
 could
 possibly
 wish
 for


out
 of
 this
 country.
 The
 least
 I
 can
 do


is
 put
 my
 shoulder
 to
 the
 wheel
 and
 help


make
 it
 better.


Okay.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 ask
 you
 if
 you


want
 Christopher
 Luxen's
 job,
 but


if
 in
 the
 future
 the
 opportunity
 arose


for
 for
 you
 to
 lead
 your
 party
 and


become
 prime
 minister,
 would
 you


consider
 it?
 I
 am
 100%
 focused
 on
 being


a
 good
 finance
 minister,
 a
 good
 economic


growth
 minister
 and
 delivering
 the


social
 investment
 framework
 that
 I
 came


to
 parliament
 with
 an
 absolute
 passion


for
 which
 is
 a
 whole
 another
 speech
 and


a
 whole
 another
 forum
 by
 the
 way.
 Could


you
 host
 that
 one
 because
 that
 is
 a


fascinating
 area
 of
 reform
 that
 I
 don't


talk
 enough
 about.
 Um
 and
 so
 my
 my
 plate


is
 full.
 Uh
 and
 I
 always
 say
 to
 people


who
 um
 are
 coming
 to
 me
 saying
 should
 I


run
 for
 parliament
 I
 normally
 say
 yes


but
 I
 also
 say
 but
 be
 really
 clear
 in


your
 head
 why
 are
 you
 coming
 because
 if


you
 are
 coming
 with
 a
 sense
 of
 personal


ego
 i.e.
 I
 want
 this
 role
 then
 chances


are
 you're
 going to
 be
 disappointed


because
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 factors
 outside


of
 your
 control
 but
 actually
 you
 should


be
 thinking
 what
 is
 the
 service
 I
 want


to
 offer
 what
 is
 the
 impact
 I
 want
 to


have
 uh
 and
 then
 seek
 opportunities
 to


make
 it.
 The
 reality
 is
 in
 this
 role
 I


have
 extraordinary
 opportunities
 every


day
 to
 have
 impact
 and
 make
 a


difference.
 I
 could
 want
 for
 no
 more.
 I


mean
 it's
 extraordinary.
 So
 um
 I'll
 uh


I'll
 do
 this
 job
 to
 the
 absolute
 best
 of


my
 abilities.
