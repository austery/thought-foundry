Hello
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 October
 4th


and
 this
 is
 Markets
 Weekly.
 So
 this
 past


week
 looking
 at
 the
 broad
 equity
 indexes


doesn't
 seem
 like
 that
 much
 is
 going
 on.


We
 have
 people
 whispering
 of
 an
 October


and
 the
 market
 did
 trend
 up
 a
 little
 bit


though
 historically
 October
 has
 been
 a


volatile
 month.
 Gold
 and
 silver
 also


trended
 higher.
 Did
 have
 a
 notable
 down


day
 on
 Thursday
 but
 those
 losses
 were


recouped
 on
 Friday.
 Now
 the
 big
 news
 the


past
 week
 of
 course
 was
 the
 government


shutdown
 and
 related
 to
 that
 the
 lack
 of


the
 monthly
 non-formms
 payroll
 sprints.


So
 today
 let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about


what
 private
 measures
 of
 the
 labor


market
 are
 saying
 and
 secondly
 let's


talk
 a
 bit
 more
 about
 the
 government


shutdown.


All
 right.
 So


every
 time
 in
 every
 let's
 say
 era
 the


the
 market
 cares
 more
 about
 some
 things


than
 others.
 When
 inflation
 was
 high,


the
 market
 cared
 most
 of
 all
 about
 um


about
 CPI
 and
 in
 prior
 errors,
 it
 cared


most
 about
 things
 like
 money
 growth
 and


so
 forth.
 Right
 now,
 we
 are
 in
 a
 period


where
 the
 market
 cares
 most
 of
 all
 about


employment
 and
 that's
 because
 that's


what
 the
 Fed
 is
 focusing
 on.
 Now,
 over


the
 past
 few
 weeks,
 it's
 become
 clear


that
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 deteriorating.


Now,
 inflation
 is
 still
 a
 little
 bit


above
 the
 Fed's
 target,
 but
 the
 Fed
 has


signaled
 that
 it's
 worried
 about
 the


labor
 market
 cut
 rates
 last
 month
 and
 is


guiding
 towards
 two
 more
 cuts
 this
 year.


Uh,
 unfortunately,


we
 did
 not
 get
 the
 monthly
 non-formance


per
 last
 week
 and
 so
 the
 market
 is
 kind


of
 flying
 blind
 and
 so
 is
 the
 Fed.


However,
 last
 week
 we
 did
 get
 some
 other


reports
 from
 the
 private
 sector
 about


the
 state
 of
 the
 labor
 market.
 So
 we
 do


have
 some
 things
 to
 go
 on
 and
 who
 knows


maybe
 going
 forward
 with
 uh
 more
 concern


about
 public
 data
 sources
 maybe
 there


will
 be
 greater
 reliance
 on
 private
 data


sources
 and
 to
 be
 clear
 this
 is
 not


something
 that's
 new.
 I
 remember
 that


after
 the
 financial
 crisis
 and
 we
 were


doing
 Huey,
 many
 people
 were
 thinking
 we


would
 have
 imminent
 hyperinflation
 did


not
 trust
 the
 inflation
 prince
 it


pointed
 to
 things
 like
 you
 know
 the


billion
 price
 project
 or
 shadow
 staff
 or


something
 like
 that
 and
 were
 were


confident
 that
 actually
 hyperinflation


was
 happening.
 It's
 just
 that
 the


government
 was
 lying
 about
 it
 and
 of


course
 that
 was
 all
 nonsense.
 However,


we
 do
 have
 some
 reputable
 measures
 of
 um


well
 estimates
 of
 how
 the
 labor
 market


is
 going.
 So,
 let's
 talk
 about
 those.


First
 off,
 we
 have
 the
 ADP
 uh
 monthly
 uh


employment
 report
 that
 they
 put
 out.
 So,


ADP
 is
 a
 large
 payment
 processor.
 If
 you


work
 in
 the
 private
 sector
 in
 the
 US,


there's
 a
 good
 chance
 that
 you
 get
 your


weekly
 paycheck
 processed
 by
 ADP.
 They


have
 about
 26
 million
 uh
 employees
 in


their
 service.
 So,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 pretty


big
 sample
 of
 how
 the
 labor
 market
 is


going.
 Now,
 the
 estimates
 were
 for
 the


ADP
 print
 to
 show
 say
 50,000
 in
 jobs


growth.
 they
 actually
 showed
 a
 loss
 of


30,000
 jobs
 last
 month.
 Again,
 it's
 a


huge
 huge
 upset.
 Now,
 a
 big
 reason
 for


them
 is
 that
 they've
 revised
 their


model,
 also
 updated
 their
 model
 to
 take


into
 account
 the
 big
 benchmark
 revisions


uh
 from
 that
 we
 got
 uh
 last
 month.
 So


because
 of
 those
 benchmark
 revisions


showing
 that
 overall
 the
 economy
 has


created
 fewer
 jobs
 than
 expected
 that


affected
 their
 model
 and
 so
 it
 gave
 us


negative
 30,000
 print.
 They
 mentioned


that
 if
 not
 for
 those
 revisions
 they'd


have
 say
 40,000
 more
 which
 would
 give


them
 let's
 say
 a
 10,000
 increase
 in
 jobs


but
 of
 course
 that
 would
 still
 be
 below


estimates.
 So
 overall
 obviously
 a


disappointing
 print
 but
 it's
 just
 one


measure.
 So
 let's
 look
 at
 other


measures.
 another
 payments
 processor,


paychecks.
 It
 doesn't
 give
 as
 granular


details
 and
 they're
 they're
 also
 a


sizable
 processor
 cover
 about
 10
 million


employees
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Also,


they
 produce
 this
 index
 and
 also
 they


have
 wage
 growth
 as
 well
 according
 to


their
 index.
 Again,
 uh
 it
 doesn't
 look


like
 the
 job
 market
 is
 doing
 very
 well.


And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 their
 wage
 gains,
 it


also
 seems
 like
 it's
 been
 steadily


decelerating
 and
 let's
 say
 increases


roughly
 about
 3%
 annual
 rate.
 So
 nothing


to
 write
 home
 about.
 Now


other
 prints
 that
 we
 get
 are
 from
 the


ISM
 survey.
 So
 these
 are
 diffusion


surveys.
 What
 what
 what
 happens
 is
 that


uh
 they're
 given
 a
 survey
 and
 asked
 to


say
 that
 no
 are
 things
 better,
 worse
 or


the
 same
 than
 last
 month.
 It
 doesn't


measure
 magnitude
 al
 only
 measures


direction.
 And
 according
 to
 the
 ISM


surveys,
 uh
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


employment
 sub
 component,
 it's
 all
 below


50.
 That
 means
 employment
 is
 getting


worse.
 So
 basically
 all
 the
 private


sectors
 of
 employment
 that
 we
 get
 the


past
 month
 all
 show
 that
 the
 labor


market
 continues
 to
 do
 poorly.
 Now


I
 think
 it's
 really
 important
 to
 note


that
 these
 measures
 of
 employment
 don't


correlate
 very
 well
 with
 the
 non-formals


data.
 So
 habitually
 people
 usually


ignore
 the
 ADP
 prints.
 However
 though


directionally
 directionally
 they
 seem
 to


move
 they
 tend
 to
 move
 in
 the
 same


direction.
 So
 the
 nonfront
 perial


sprints
 when
 we
 eventually
 get
 it


probably
 won't
 look
 very
 good.


Now
 uh
 one
 thing
 to
 note
 is
 that
 you


have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 looking
 at
 this
 and


just
 say
 shrugging
 it
 off
 and
 saying
 you


know
 this
 is
 all
 due
 to
 supply
 side


issues.
 I
 have
 to
 say
 because
 of
 the


crackdown
 in
 illegal
 immigration,
 that's


what's
 infecting
 the
 job
 sprint
 and
 that


is
 definitely
 part
 of
 it.
 Uh
 but
 it's


also
 pretty
 clear
 though
 that
 there's
 a


demand
 component
 because
 if
 we
 suddenly


have
 less
 supply
 of
 labor,
 you
 would


expect
 that
 the
 price
 of
 labor,
 so
 wages


to
 go
 up,
 but
 that's
 just
 not
 happening.


So
 definitely
 a
 demand
 component
 there


as
 well.
 Now,
 one
 thing
 that
 I
 thought


was
 super
 interesting
 the
 past
 week
 was


that
 when
 we
 had
 the
 poor
 jobs
 market


data
 from
 ADP,
 the
 market
 actually
 went


up,
 the
 stock
 market
 went
 up,
 the
 bond


markets,
 you
 know,
 priced
 in
 more
 rate


cuts,
 so
 rates
 went
 lower,
 but
 the
 stock


market
 actually
 went
 up.
 So
 that
 seems


to
 be
 a
 tell
 that
 we're
 in
 a
 regime


where
 bad
 news
 is
 good
 news
 whereas


normally
 you
 would
 say
 that
 hey
 we're


increasing
 the
 probability
 of
 a


recession
 maybe
 that's
 not
 good
 maybe


stocks
 should
 sell
 off
 but
 it
 seems
 like


there's
 a
 class
 of
 investors
 who
 think


that
 bad
 data
 more
 red
 cuts
 market
 go


up.
 So
 that's
 an
 interesting
 shift
 in


the
 regime
 and
 that
 that
 that's
 volatile


that
 could
 change
 at
 any
 moment
 but
 that


seems
 to
 be
 what's
 happening
 at
 the
 time


at
 the
 moment.
 So
 that
 leads
 us
 to
 my


next
 topic
 the
 government
 shutdown.


So
 what
 happens
 during
 a
 government


shutdown?
 So
 this
 is
 different
 from
 the


debt
 ceiling
 issue.
 So
 periodically
 we


go
 into
 debt
 sealing
 issues
 or


government
 shutdowns.
 The
 last
 shutdown


we
 had
 was
 during
 Trump's
 first
 term,


and
 that's
 when
 the
 president
 demanded


um
 border
 wall
 funding
 in
 exchange
 for


uh
 government
 funding
 didn't
 work
 well


for
 him.
 That
 shutdown
 went
 on
 for
 over


30
 days
 and
 eventually
 he
 caved.
 But
 a


government
 shutdown
 is
 when
 Congress
 and


the
 legislature
 can't
 agree
 on
 whether


or
 not
 to
 have
 a
 bill
 to
 continue
 to


fund
 the
 government.
 The
 government
 can


access
 the
 debt
 markets.
 It
 can
 issue


treasury
 debt,
 no
 problem.
 Uh
 it
 just


doesn't
 have
 the
 authority
 to
 spend
 the


money.
 And
 that's
 what
 we're
 arguing


towards
 right
 now.
 Now,
 when
 the


government
 can't
 agree
 on,
 you
 know,
 to


have
 a
 bill
 to
 continue
 to
 finance
 the


government,
 then
 the
 government
 just


shuts
 down
 until
 it
 gets
 a
 bill.
 Now,


during
 a
 shutdown,
 there's
 a
 division
 of


employees
 between
 iness
 essential
 and


non-essential.
 non-essential
 employees


go
 home.
 Um
 there's
 about
 let's
 say
 7


800,000
 of
 these.
 Uh
 but
 um
 they're


basically
 on
 furowed
 or
 holiday
 or


something
 like
 that.
 But
 don't
 worry,


they
 are
 not
 paid
 at
 the
 moment.
 But


when
 the
 government
 resumes,
 they
 get


back
 pay.
 So
 the
 economic
 impact
 of
 this


isn't
 super
 large.
 You
 can
 say
 that


workers
 that
 would
 have
 gone
 to
 local


restaurants
 to
 get
 lunch,
 now
 they're


not
 doing
 that.
 And
 so
 the
 local


restaurant
 will
 suffer.
 But
 in
 so
 far
 as


the
 workers
 having
 money
 to
 spend,
 you


know,
 they're
 they're
 going
 to
 skip
 a


paycheck,
 but
 they'll
 get
 that
 in
 back


pay.
 So,
 it's
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal.


Essential
 workers
 will
 continue
 to
 work.


So,
 that's
 like
 the
 police,
 the


military,
 uh,
 airports,
 and
 it
 looks


like
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 national
 parks
 will


continue
 to
 function
 as
 well,
 which
 is


great
 because
 I
 would
 hate
 to
 be
 a


tourist,
 fly
 all
 the
 way
 over
 to
 the


United
 States,
 go
 to
 Yellowstone,
 and


and
 find
 out
 that
 it's
 closed.


So
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 impass
 right
 now


has
 to
 do
 with
 health
 care.
 So
 the


Democrats
 would
 like
 to
 have
 renewal
 in


a
 lot
 of
 the
 tax
 uh
 credits
 or
 the


credits
 that
 support
 health
 care
 or


Republicans
 want
 those
 to
 lapse.
 Now
 the


argument
 Democrats
 give
 is
 that
 these


healthc
 care
 subsidies
 are
 going
 to


impact
 a
 lot
 of
 Republican
 voters
 as


well.
 And
 that's
 totally
 true.
 you
 know,


poor
 people
 are
 part
 of
 the
 Democratic


party
 and
 part
 of
 the
 Republican
 party.


And
 if
 the
 Republicans
 continue
 with


their,
 you
 know,
 not
 wanting
 to
 renew


these
 healthcare
 subsidies,
 a
 lot
 of


their
 own
 voters
 will
 be
 impacted.
 And


so
 they
 feel
 that
 this
 is
 a
 good


political
 issue.
 The
 messaging
 from
 the


Republican
 side
 is
 that
 well,
 the


Democrats
 are
 trying
 to
 shut
 the


government
 down
 because
 they
 want
 to


give
 benefits
 to
 illegal
 immigrants.
 And


honestly,
 that
 there's
 some
 truth
 to


that
 as
 well.
 some
 of
 the
 funding
 uh


does
 go
 to
 illegal
 immigrants
 in


emergency
 circumstances
 and
 that
 is
 kind


of
 a
 very
 unpopular
 point.
 There's
 a


perception
 uh
 that
 uh
 Democrats
 are


giving
 benefits
 to
 illegal
 immigrants.


We've
 seen
 that
 over
 the
 past
 few
 years


when
 illegal
 immigrants
 are
 uh
 given
 uh


lodging
 and
 hotels
 and
 food
 and
 so
 forth


and
 that's
 been
 unpopular
 since
 many


poor
 Americans
 uh
 are
 feeling
 the
 pinch.


So
 the
 shutdown
 according
 to
 the
 betting


markets
 can
 go
 17
 days
 although
 the


people
 that
 I
 listen
 to
 who
 are
 really


politically
 plugged
 in
 suggest
 that
 it


will
 resolve
 faster
 than
 expected.
 Uh


the
 big
 problem
 of
 course
 is
 that
 well


from
 the
 Republican
 side
 you
 know
 nobody


wants
 to
 cut
 healthcare.
 From
 the


Democrat
 side
 historically
 speaking
 when


you're
 trying
 to
 shut
 down
 the


government
 as
 a
 negotiating
 position
 it


it's
 not
 politically
 popular.
 So
 that's


why
 President
 Trump
 had
 to
 cave
 in
 2018.


And
 this
 time
 around,
 the
 Democrats
 of


course
 are
 aware
 of
 this.
 There's
 no


fallout
 immediately.
 Stock
 market


continues
 to
 up.
 A
 lot
 of
 central


service
 continue
 to
 function.
 So
 there's


really
 no
 urgency
 to
 end
 it.
 But
 as
 this


goes
 on,
 I
 think
 there's
 more
 pressure


on
 the
 on
 the
 side
 that's
 not
 willing


that's
 using
 this
 as
 a
 bargaining
 chip


to
 to
 cave.
 Now,
 why
 is
 this
 an
 issue?


So
 this
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 hold.
 This
 seems


to
 be
 driven
 largely
 by
 minority
 Senate


leader
 Schumer
 of
 the
 state
 of
 New
 York.


Now
 earlier
 in
 the
 year
 there
 was
 also


the
 prospect
 of
 a
 shutdown.
 Senator


Schumer
 caped
 very
 quickly
 back
 then
 and


that
 drew
 a
 lot
 of
 criticism
 from
 within


the
 progressive
 wing
 of
 the
 Democratic


party
 and
 he
 is
 sensitive
 to
 that.
 A
 lot


of
 people
 in
 the
 Democratic
 party
 are


looking
 at
 all
 the
 things
 that
 President


Trump
 is
 doing.
 They're
 very
 worried
 and


they
 really
 want
 their
 leaders
 to
 stand


up
 and
 do
 something
 about
 it.
 Now,


another
 wrinkle
 in
 this
 is
 that
 uh


Senator
 Schumer,
 Senator
 of
 New
 York,
 is


facing
 a
 potential
 challenge
 by


progressive
 star
 Alexandria
 Alaziocortez


in
 2028.


So,
 it
 seems
 like
 some
 people
 think
 that


he
 might
 be
 facing
 some
 pressure
 to
 act


a
 bit
 tougher
 and
 appease
 a
 bit
 more
 of


the
 progressive
 elements
 in
 his


constituency.
 Otherwise,
 you
 know,
 maybe


he'll
 he'll
 lose
 in
 2028.
 and
 AOC
 is
 a


very
 formidable
 uh
 political
 star
 and
 of


course
 she's
 part
 of
 the
 progressive


wing.
 So
 uh
 looks
 like
 we're
 going
 to


just
 kind
 of
 hold
 this
 until
 probably
 we


get
 some
 kind
 of
 resolution.
 My
 best


guess
 is
 that
 this
 will
 get
 resolved


next
 week
 and
 when
 that
 happens
 uh
 I


think
 the
 markets
 will
 like
 it
 and
 maybe


uh
 traditional
 safe
 havens
 that
 were


perceived
 to
 benefit
 from
 this
 like
 gold


and
 crypto
 might
 might
 have
 a
 pullback.


Now,
 one
 thing
 to
 note
 though
 is
 that,


you
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 why
 you
 can


have
 uh
 this
 end
 quickly
 is
 that
 you
 you


kind
 of
 want
 the
 some
 kind
 of
 forcing


mechanism.
 So,
 it
 looks
 like
 we're
 not


getting
 big
 complaints
 from
 people.


Looks
 like
 we're
 not
 getting
 good


complaints
 on
 the
 market.
 So,
 it
 could


also
 be
 one
 of
 these
 weird
 circumstances


where
 uh
 unless
 the
 market
 goes
 down,
 we


won't
 have
 a
 resolution.
 And
 so,
 but


when
 we
 do
 have
 a
 resolution,
 the
 market


go
 up.
 So,
 it's
 kind
 of
 silly
 like
 this.


Anyway,
 we'll
 find
 out
 next
 week.
 So


far,


it
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 be
 a
 big
 deal.
 And


again,
 this
 can
 drag
 on
 for
 a
 long
 time.


Last
 time
 it
 lasted
 more
 than
 30
 days.


Right
 now,
 it's
 only
 been
 three.
 All


right,
 so
 that's
 all
 I
 have
 prepared
 for


this
 week.
 Talk
 to
 you
 all
 next
 week.
