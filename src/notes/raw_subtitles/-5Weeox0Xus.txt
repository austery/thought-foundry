[Music]


hi
 everybody
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 the
 CEO


of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 wealth
 fund


and
 today
 I'm
 here
 with
 Stan
 Ren
 Miller


at
 proper
 legend
 in
 the
 investment
 World


San
 what
 a
 pleasure
 to
 be
 here
 happy
 to


see
 you
 niai
 now
 what
 are
 the
 most


important
 data
 you're
 looking
 at
 these


days
 currently
 yeah
 interestingly
 enough


I'm
 known
 as
 a
 macro
 investor
 but
 I
 do
 a


macro
 from
 the
 bottom
 up
 so
 we're


listening
 primarily
 to
 companies
 and


we're
 not
 seeing


any
 material
 signs
 of
 weakness
 other


than
 maybe
 in
 the
 housing
 market
 but


that's
 from
 a
 very
 elevated
 price
 level


so
 we're
 not
 seeing
 bottom
 up
 in


information
 indicating
 to
 us
 that


there's
 an
 economic
 problem
 anytime
 in


the
 next
 3
 to
 six
 months
 I
 would
 also


say
 I'm
 revealing
 now
 that
 I'm
 more
 of
 a


market
 animal
 than
 an
 economist
 that
 we


look
 at
 Financial


conditions
 they've
 been
 very
 very
 loose


I
 mean
 they're
 is
 looser
 looser
 than


they
 were
 when
 the
 FED
 actually
 started


tightening
 they've
 tightened


considerably
 in
 the


last
 four
 or
 five
 weeks
 ever
 since
 the


ironically
 ever
 since
 the
 FED
 cut


because
 the
 dollar
 has
 ried
 and


obviously
 interest
 rates
 have
 gone
 up


but
 they're
 still
 they're
 still
 quite


above
 normal
 so
 that's
 pretty
 much
 the


data
 we're
 looking
 at
 I'd
 say
 the
 other


thing
 I'm
 focused
 on
 I've
 been
 obsessed


with
 whether
 we
 were
 in
 the
 70s
 um


really
 since
 2021
 when
 this
 whole


inflationary
 episode
 started
 and
 I'd
 say


two
 years
 ago
 or
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago
 I


was
 very
 confident
 that
 inflation
 was


going
 to
 come
 down
 which
 I
 was
 right
 on


but
 I
 was
 worried
 about
 the
 economy


which
 I
 was
 completely
 wrong
 on
 um
 more


recently
 and
 you
 can
 take
 this
 with
 a


grain
 of
 salt
 since
 I
 had
 one
 right
 and


one
 wrong
 there
 um
 I've
 switched
 to


being
 more
 worried
 about
 inflation
 going


forward
 uh
 than
 the
 economy
 itself
 why


do
 I
 say
 that
 if
 we
 go
 back
 to
 the
 70s


there
 was
 an
 episode
 with
 OPEC
 that
 set


off
 an
 inflation
 you
 had
 a


recession


and
 inflation
 came
 down
 I
 think
 from


about
 8
 to
 3
 and
 then
 went
 back
 up
 again


yes
 and
 what
 Bo
 what's
 bothered
 me
 and


what
 I
 have
 wanted
 to
 say


you're
 exactly
 right
 it
 went
 back
 up


again
 it
 went
 back
 up
 again
 and
 the


number
 of


months
 um
 would
 correlate
 to
 the
 bottom


being
 right
 about
 now
 yeah
 so
 my


confidence
 a
 year
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago


was
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 that
 period


where
 we
 came
 down
 again
 and
 then
 we'd


see
 and
 I'm
 a
 little
 worried
 that
 the


FED
 has
 declared
 Victory
 too
 early
 I


don't
 have
 conviction
 like
 I
 had
 in
 21


that
 inflation
 was
 going
 going
 to
 go
 up


that's
 when
 the
 money
 supply
 was
 growing


40%
 and
 all
 sorts
 of
 things
 were


happening
 but
 I
 also
 don't
 have


conviction
 that
 they've
 snuffed
 this


thing
 out
 and
 won
 the
 battle
 and
 to
 cut


50
 basis


points
 with
 credit
 spreads
 tight
 gold
 at


new
 highs
 equity's
 roaring
 no
 sign
 of


weakness
 um
 material
 weakness
 in
 the


economy
 of
 course
 there
 are
 some
 spots


um
 that
 just
 makes
 me
 nervous
 that
 this


thing
 could
 turn
 up
 again
 what
 would


make
 you
 turn
 up
 again
 what
 would
 be
 the


factors
 I
 think
 what
 I
 just
 said
 uh


easing
 into
 Financial
 conditions
 let's


say
 um
 Trump
 wins
 if
 Trump
 wins
 you


could
 have
 animal
 spirits
 from
 the


business
 Community
 who
 are
 dying
 for


deregulation
 you
 could
 have
 tariffs


which
 are
 on
 the
 margin


inflationary
 uh
 immigration
 has
 been
 a


great
 Boon
 to
 this
 country
 maybe
 not
 the


way
 it
 was
 done
 but
 it
 certainly
 enabled


us
 to
 have
 growth
 without
 inflation
 and


labor
 materially
 the
 last
 two
 or
 three


years
 so
 the
 combination
 of
 animal


spirits
 recovery
 doing
 better
 than
 it
 is


I'm
 just
 open-minded
 to
 it
 again
 why
 is


it
 so
 urgent
 for
 the
 central
 bank
 to
 cut


given
 this
 honestly
 um
 I
 don't
 take
 the


nefarious
 view
 that
 pal
 is
 doing
 it
 for


quote
 unquote
 political
 reasons
 I
 do


think
 he's
 obsessed
 with
 the
 soft


landing
 and
 I
 think
 he's
 obsessed
 with


his
 legacy
 and
 having
 made
 the
 mistake


he
 made
 in
 21
 and
 he's
 being
 egged
 on
 by


other
 economists
 in
 the
 press
 to
 me
 the


fed's
 job
 is
 to
 avoid
 the
 big
 big


mistakes
 yeah
 like
 the
 70s
 like
 the


great
 financial
 crisis
 like
 the
 big


inflation
 we
 just
 had
 but
 all
 this
 fine


tuning
 and
 woring
 about
 a
 soft
 Landing


that
 that
 is
 not
 the
 job
 of
 the
 FED
 in


my
 opinion
 is
 to
 maximize
 employment
 for


the
 long
 term
 not
 for
 the
 next
 three


months
 or
 the
 next
 four
 months
 but
 I


think
 the
 fed's
 obsession
 with
 nailing


this
 so-called
 soft
 Landing
 I
 would


remind
 everybody
 that
 the
 reason
 we're


having
 a
 landing
 is
 because
 they
 took


they
 let
 inflation
 go
 from
 2
 to
 %.
 yeah


so
 there
 was
 no
 need
 for
 a
 landing
 for


20
 years
 but
 um
 I
 think
 that's
 what


they're
 obsessed
 with
 I
 don't
 really
 I


don't
 know
 how
 much
 of
 a
 problem
 is
 the


forward
 guidance
 it's
 a
 huge
 problem
 um


my
 friend
 dream
 grants
 says
 they're


forward
 guidance
 dependent
 not
 data


dependent
 um
 it's
 a
 problem
 because
 once


you
 do
 forward
 guidance
 you
 eliminate


your
 optionality
 yeah
 and
 I
 think


Nikolai
 you
 and
 I
 being
 in
 this
 business


we
 know
 we
 have
 to
 change
 our
 mind
 when


we're
 wrong
 yeah
 this
 fed
 has


shown
 over
 and
 over
 again
 that
 they


think
 if
 they
 change
 their
 mind
 they're


losing
 credibility
 so
 it
 makes
 them
 have


their
 hands
 tied
 behind
 their
 back
 I'm


wrong
 all
 the
 time
 I
 think
 my
 record
 is


mainly
 because
 when
 I'm
 wrong
 I
 changed


my
 mind
 not
 that
 I'm
 always
 right
 I'm


certainly
 not
 forward
 guidance
 seems
 to


tie
 them
 into
 positions
 where
 and


eliminate
 flexibility
 they
 need
 how
 big


a
 problem
 is
 the
 budget
 deficit
 as
 a


practitioner
 it's
 something
 I
 can't
 be


obsessed
 with
 on
 a
 3
 to
 six
 Monon
 basis


as
 an
 American
 it's
 something
 I'm
 really


obsessed
 with
 because
 debt
 to
 GDP
 can't


go
 up
 forever
 and
 to
 me
 we
 have
 a


reckoning
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 the
 time


when
 that's
 going
 to
 take
 place
 I
 will


say
 that
 because
 the
 reserve


currency
 we've
 been
 permitted
 to
 engage


in
 behavior
 that
 say
 the
 Brits
 couldn't


have
 behaved
 in
 there's
 a
 new
 term
 I


have
 getting
 LZ
 trust
 we
 haven't
 been
 LZ


trust
 because
 we
 are
 the
 reserve


currency
 even
 though
 if
 you
 look
 at


everything
 we're
 doing
 it's
 much
 more


radical
 than
 the
 Brits
 were
 doing
 yeah


um
 what's
 that
 old
 saying
 how
 do
 you
 go


bankrupt
 slowly
 and
 then
 suddenly


running
 deficits
 with
 full
 employment
 at


basically
 at
 7%
 of


GDP
 is
 a
 recipe
 that
 can't
 last
 forever


one
 of
 the
 reasons
 we
 haven't
 paid
 for


it
 is
 in
 Co
 the
 entire
 private
 sector


80%
 of
 individuals
 refinance
 their


mortgages
 so
 the
 average
 mortgage
 rate


is
 still
 under
 4%
 even
 though
 at
 the


margin
 it
 got
 to
 8%
 corporations
 termed


out
 their
 debt
 that
 stuff
 rolls
 over
 in


25
 and
 26
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a


problem
 it's
 probably
 more
 like
 late
 25


early
 26
 but
 you
 just
 don't
 know
 so
 and


what
 is
 it
 that
 can
 create
 this
 kind
 of


trust
 moment
 where
 people
 suddenly


change
 their
 mind
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 price


they
 want
 to
 have
 to
 lend
 money
 to
 it


could
 it
 could
 be
 a
 failed
 auction
 it


could
 be
 If
 the
 Fed
 is
 wrong
 about


inflation
 and
 it
 turns
 back
 up
 again


because
 they're
 easing
 Financial


conditions
 into
 a
 melt
 up
 um
 if
 they


were
 to
 have
 to
 start
 increasing


interest
 rates
 again
 which
 is
 why
 I


think
 they
 should
 be
 so
 cautious
 about


their


optionality
 um
 now
 that
 they've
 forward


guided
 to
 a
 series
 of
 cuts
 that
 could


cause
 it
 um
 my
 best
 guess
 would
 be
 a


failed
 auction
 but
 honestly
 it
 could
 be


6
 months
 it
 could
 be
 six
 years
 I
 I
 just


don't
 know
 so
 he
 rat
 start
 to
 go
 up
 how


high
 can
 they
 go
 well
 that's
 a
 great


question
 because
 right
 now
 the
 10
 year
 I


guess
 it's
 around
 4
 and
 a
 half
 it
 can
 go


to
 nominal
 GDP
 so
 let's
 say
 inflation


went
 to
 four
 4
 and
 A2
 and
 real
 growth


was
 2
 and
 a
 half
 or
 three
 10
 years
 AG
 go


to
 six
 or
 seven
 I'm
 not
 predicting
 that


but
 that
 would
 be
 consistent
 if
 things


if
 inflation
 did
 turn
 back
 up
 again
 and


the
 economy
 wasn't
 weakening
 I
 think
 you


could
 get
 there
 it's
 interesting
 that's


what
 happened
 in
 the
 70
 the
 bond
 market


didn't
 really
 respond
 until
 we
 went
 back


up
 from
 like
 3
 to
 12
 and
 then
 it
 it


responded
 in
 Spades
 again
 I'm
 not


predicting
 this
 but
 I'm
 as
 a


practitioner
 I'm
 very
 open-minded
 to
 it


and
 I've
 got
 a
 it's
 like
 on
 my
 radar


well
 you
 say
 you
 make
 the
 most
 money


from
 uh
 from
 fed
 mistakes
 so
 is
 this
 the


way
 you
 are
 positioned
 now
 I'm
 short


ponds
 I'm
 not
 like
 mega
 short
 I
 I


actually
 had
 good
 timing
 for
 once
 I


shorted
 them
 literally
 the
 day
 the
 FED


cut
 um
 it's
 been
 kind
 of
 an
 easy
 ride


since
 then
 I
 should
 have
 been
 much


bigger
 now
 that
 they
 move
 so
 much
 I'm
 a


little
 worried
 about
 um
 if
 anything


being
 too
 big
 but
 yeah
 no
 that's
 the
 way


I'm
 positioned
 if
 I
 thought
 what
 we
 are


talking
 about
 was
 happening
 and
 I
 don't


see
 a
 sign
 of
 it
 yet
 I'm
 just


open-minded
 to
 it
 I
 would
 be
 much
 bigger


I'm
 like


25%
 naav
 short
 uh
 10e
 equivalent
 moving


on
 to
 the
 stock
 market
 uh
 the
 leadership


is
 very
 narrow
 it's
 led
 by
 not
 so
 many


stocks
 just
 how
 do
 you
 read
 this
 narrow


leadership
 um
 it's
 never
 been
 great
 but


the
 leadership's
 not
 as
 narrow
 as
 it
 was


last
 April
 so
 you're
 starting
 to
 get


some
 broadening
 out
 the
 financials
 are


doing
 better
 it's
 not
 great
 we've
 never


had
 a
 bare
 Market
 start
 without
 the


leadership
 narrowing
 and
 it's
 narrowing


enough
 that
 you're
 starting
 to
 get


toward
 a
 necessary
 condition
 being


satisfied
 but
 it's
 early
 but
 it's
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 yellow
 light
 it's
 not
 a
 red
 light


that's
 how
 I
 read
 it
 so
 how
 do
 you
 think


the
 tech
 sector
 will
 develop
 what
 kind


of
 science
 are
 you
 seeing
 there
 the
 AI


boom
 is
 going
 unabated
 Nikolai
 the
 I


think
 the
 private
 sector
 just
 sees
 it
 as


an
 existential
 threat
 to
 their
 business


if
 they
 don't
 um
 spend
 money
 on
 it


because
 if
 they
 don't
 spend
 money
 on
 it


and
 their
 competitors
 do
 and
 their


competitors
 are
 right
 they're
 going
 to


have
 a
 big
 big
 competitive
 problem
 and


of
 course
 the


hyperscalers
 they're
 all
 in
 and
 their


demand
 is
 just
 continuing
 so
 look
 you've


got
 very
 rich
 prices
 in
 the
 tech
 sector


stuff
 like
 apple
 selling
 I
 know
 25
 or
 30


times
 earnings
 it's
 certainly
 not


growing
 at
 25
 or
 30%
 but
 we
 don't
 have


that
 much
 exposure
 to
 the
 tech
 sector


and
 we're
 not
 short
 it
 so
 not
 really


involved
 cuz
 but
 you
 were
 very
 early


into
 it
 yeah
 what
 um
 how
 do
 you
 spot


these
 early
 Trends
 what
 is
 said
 that
 you


look
 at
 honestly
 uh
 I've
 got
 young


really
 good
 analysts
 here
 yeah
 a
 lot
 of


people
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 young
 analysts
 who


are
 who
 are
 on
 top
 of
 things
 and
 they


started
 um
 we
 noticed
 about
 three
 or


four
 years
 ago
 that
 the
 kids
 that
 go
 to


Stanford
 and
 MIT
 the
 engineers
 were


shifting
 from
 crypto
 to
 AI


that
 was
 the
 first
 signed
 then
 my
 my


young
 Partners
 started
 talking
 more
 and


more
 about
 AI
 uh
 I
 asked
 them
 how
 to


play
 it
 they
 mentioned
 a
 company
 called


Nvidia
 which
 I
 thought
 was
 a
 gaming


company
 I
 hadn't
 done
 work
 on
 in
 a
 long


time
 um
 I
 bought
 a
 pretty
 good
 chunk
 of


it
 and
 then
 like
 a
 month
 later
 chaty
 PT


happened
 it
 was
 just
 total
 luck
 I
 had
 no


idea
 caty
 p
 but
 the
 AI
 drum
 around
 here


was
 big
 enough
 and
 the
 stock
 was
 down
 I


think
 from
 400
 to
 150
 or
 something
 so


that's
 how
 I
 got
 started
 in
 it
 once
 we


invest
 in
 something
 like
 that
 then
 we


really
 start
 to
 dig
 deeper
 and
 then


there
 was
 a
 whole
 chain
 of
 things
 we


knew
 it
 would
 affect
 power
 we
 knew
 it


would
 affect
 uranium
 we
 just
 went


through
 the
 whole
 chain
 and
 it
 was
 a


pretty
 easy
 Trend
 to
 spot
 not
 not
 unlike


um
 the
 cloud
 was
 the
 you
 know
 these


things
 come
 in
 waves
 M
 but
 AI
 the


question
 with
 AI
 now
 that
 I'm
 wrestling


with
 and
 the
 reason
 our
 exposure
 is


really
 neither
 long
 nor
 short
 is
 how
 to


play
 it
 because
 we
 started
 with
 pix
 and


shovels
 which
 is
 Invidia
 and
 to
 some


extent
 um
 Microsoft
 but
 now
 we're
 seeing


just
 massive
 amounts
 of
 capital
 being


spent
 by
 these


modelers
 and
 if
 AI
 is
 for
 real
 and
 I


think
 it
 is
 they're
 all
 going
 to
 give


you
 the
 same
 answer
 so
 we're
 going
 to


have
 four
 or
 five
 companies
 will
 spent


masses
 amounts
 of
 capital
 but
 I
 don't


see
 it
 as
 a
 win
 or
 take
 all
 model
 on
 the


other
 hand
 I
 think
 there
 applications
 um


that
 I
 haven't
 even
 thought
 of
 and


nobody's
 thought
 of
 they're
 going
 to


spring
 up
 I
 mean
 who
 would
 have
 thought


of
 Uber
 or
 Facebook
 when
 the
 internet


started
 so
 we're
 very
 bullish
 on
 AI


but
 we're
 not
 bullish
 currently
 on


exactly
 where
 we're
 supposed
 to
 be
 and


how
 to
 play
 it
 aggressively
 not
 unlike


the
 internet
 in
 2201
 you
 could
 have


believed
 in
 the
 internet
 not
 been


exposed
 and
 then
 got
 your
 exposure
 on
 a


more
 timely
 basis
 or
 I
 could
 just
 be


wrong
 which
 is
 wouldn't
 be
 that
 unusual


but
 you
 were
 also
 early
 into
 the


anti-obesity
 drug
 producers
 oh
 that
 was


easy
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 it's
 like


in
 Norway
 but
 in
 America


yeah
 if
 you
 go
 to
 Disney
 World


everything
 and
 if
 you
 know
 the
 American


psyche
 if
 you
 know
 an
 American
 they
 got


a
 way
 to
 lose
 weight
 without
 doing
 any


work
 and
 uh
 I
 I
 knew
 the
 drug
 worked


early
 on
 just
 because
 we
 were
 exposed
 to


it
 but
 I
 and
 then
 when
 I
 heard
 if
 you


get
 off
 the
 drug
 you
 gain
 the
 weight


back
 then
 I
 knew
 it
 was
 sort
 of
 a
 razor


blade
 business
 cuz
 people
 would
 have
 to


say
 on
 the
 drug
 yeah
 but
 you
 say
 it's
 C


but
 I
 mean
 hey
 it's
 not
 like
 you're
 the


only
 one
 who
 is
 walking
 around
 around
 in


Disneyland
 and
 looking
 at
 these
 kind
 of


things
 right
 so
 but
 you
 you
 actually
 you


actually
 act
 on
 your
 Intuition
 or
 your


all
 the
 data
 that's
 in
 front
 of
 you
 I
 do


but
 it's
 it's
 you
 know
 it's
 not
 all


Brilliance
 I
 I
 I
 bought
 Nvidia
 very
 well


but
 I
 sold
 it
 eight
 or
 900
 right
 when


the
 party
 was
 really
 getting
 going
 and
 I


sold
 my
 Lily
 in
 the
 high
 700s
 granted


had
 a
 had
 a
 nice
 profit
 but
 yeah
 I
 look


for
 for
 big
 trends
 I'm
 not
 about
 guy


that
 holds
 for
 20
 years
 but
 I
 look
 for


two
 to
 four
 years
 stuff
 and
 both
 fit


into
 that
 category
 and
 frankly
 we're


looking
 now
 for
 AI


applications
 that
 might
 not
 have
 been


recognized
 yet
 I
 think
 I'm
 on
 the
 board


of
 memal
 slone
 ketering
 have
 been
 for


almost
 30
 years
 and
 the
 applications
 in


cancer
 are
 unreal
 and
 just
 FYI
 the


memorial
 slone
 cing
 is
 the
 leading


cancer
 hospital
 in
 the
 world
 yes
 and


they
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 in
 the


endowment
 partly
 because
 you
 are
 on
 the


board
 or
 the
 investment
 committee
 well


they
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 in
 their
 D
 and


I
 wouldn't
 say
 partly
 because
 I'm
 on
 the


board
 but
 thank
 you
 now
 um
 when
 we
 last


met
 you
 mentioned
 the
 concept
 of
 buy


first
 analyze
 later
 tell
 me
 about
 that


yeah
 Soros
 used
 to
 call
 it
 invest
 and


invest
 and
 then
 investigate
 I
 think
 I


just
 gave
 a
 classic
 example
 I
 didn't


know
 that
 much
 about
 Nvidia
 I
 just
 knew


that
 Ai
 and
 I
 had
 some
 people
 here
 tell


me
 how
 to
 play
 it
 so
 we
 bought
 Invidia


and
 then
 we
 we
 were
 in
 the
 process
 of


doing
 a
 lot
 more
 work
 and
 then
 chat
 GPT


tap
 and
 but
 I've
 always
 had
 the
 view


that
 markets
 are
 smart
 they're
 fast
 and


they're
 getting
 much
 more
 so
 with
 with


all
 the
 communication
 and
 the
 technology


we
 have


today
 and
 that
 if
 I
 hear
 a
 concept
 and
 I


like
 it
 uh
 if
 I
 wait
 and
 spend
 two
 or


three
 months
 analyzing
 it
 I
 may
 miss
 big


part
 of
 the
 move
 and
 then


psychologically
 be
 paralyzed
 it's
 hard


to
 buy
 a
 stock
 you're
 looking
 at
 at
 100


it's
 160
 even
 if
 it's
 going
 to
 400


somehow
 your
 your
 head
 is
 screwed
 up
 and


you're
 waiting
 for
 the
 pullback
 so
 we


will
 we
 will
 buy
 something
 a
 meaningful


position
 but
 not
 Earth
 shaking
 and
 then


really
 do
 the
 work
 and
 if
 I
 think
 we


made
 a
 mistake
 I'll
 sell
 it
 and
 if
 I


don't
 think
 we
 made
 a
 mistake
 We'll
 add


to
 it
 if
 if
 we
 have
 to
 yeah
 no
 I
 I
 I


happen
 to
 have
 worked
 exactly
 the
 same


way
 uh
 in
 my
 life
 it
 it
 really
 focuses


in
 your
 your
 work
 and
 your
 efforts
 your


thinking
 but
 have
 you
 always
 believed
 in


your
 own
 pattern
 recognition
 yes
 when
 I


started
 in
 the
 business
 I
 got
 promoted


too
 early
 so
 before
 I
 had
 really
 learned


the
 nuts
 and
 bolts
 of
 the
 analysis
 to


the
 extent
 that
 I
 should
 have
 I
 was


promoted
 to
 to
 a
 to
 a
 leadership


position
 and
 I
 had
 to
 rely
 a
 lot
 on


charts
 and
 I
 had
 to
 rely
 a
 lot
 on


intuition
 but
 I
 found
 it's
 not
 that
 hard


if
 if
 you're
 dealing
 with
 a
 psychical


company
 and
 they're
 losing
 money
 or


they're
 not
 profitable
 and
 everybody
 in


their
 industry
 is
 shutting
 capacity
 down


it
 doesn't
 take
 a
 rocket
 scientist
 to


try
 and
 envision
 18
 to
 24
 months
 out
 if


nobody's
 add
 in
 capacity
 they
 may
 not
 be


losing
 money
 anymore
 they
 might
 be


making
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 I
 have
 found
 it's


very
 important
 never
 to
 invest
 in
 the


present
 always
 try
 and
 envision
 the


situation
 as
 you
 see
 it
 in
 18
 to
 24


months
 and
 then
 see
 if
 if
 you
 feel


things
 would
 be
 differently
 than
 they


are
 now
 would
 security
 prices
 reflect


that
 I
 think
 that's
 probably
 the
 biggest


mistake


investors
 make
 is
 they
 invest
 in
 the


present
 rather
 than
 forward
 looking
 and


looking
 where
 the
 Puck's
 going
 instead


of
 where
 the
 puck
 is
 yeah
 now
 um
 a
 few


people
 believe
 in
 other
 people's


gutfield
 did
 Soros
 believe
 in
 your


gutfield
 or
 did
 you
 have
 to
 show
 him


analysis
 Soros
 and
 I
 had
 a
 rocky
 start
 I


I
 I
 went
 there
 I
 had
 had


some
 uh
 significant
 success
 running


public
 funds
 at


dfus
 and
 he
 told
 me
 I
 was
 his
 successor


but
 I
 don't
 really
 think
 his
 mind
 was


completely
 made
 up
 when
 I
 got
 there
 and


and
 the
 first
 6
 months
 were
 quite
 Rocky


because
 it
 wasn't
 clear
 who
 was
 in


charge
 um
 frankly
 we're
 both
 trading


badly
 and
 I
 was
 flying
 to
 Pittsburgh
 cuz


I
 still
 had
 Duane
 I
 was
 running
 both
 and


um
 when
 I
 got
 off
 the
 airplane
 I
 think


we
 had
 payones
 back
 then
 we
 didn't
 have


cell
 phones
 and
 uh
 the
 head
 Trader
 there


told
 me
 he
 had
 told
 out
 sold
 out
 my
 bond


position
 so
 I
 probably
 had
 a
 higher


opinion
 of
 myself
 at
 the
 time
 that
 I


should
 have
 I
 was
 young
 and
 I
 had
 always


been
 in
 charge
 so
 I
 was
 quite
 upset
 and


uh
 basically


uh
 expressed
 extreme
 displeasure
 and
 he


said
 we'll
 talk
 about
 it
 when
 you
 come


back
 to
 New


York
 um
 implied
 that
 I
 I
 wanted
 to
 quit


and
 he
 said
 that
 uh
 maybe
 there
 were
 too


many
 cooks
 in
 the
 kitchen
 and
 he
 was


going
 to
 Eastern
 Europe
 for
 four
 or
 five


years
 he'd
 be
 out
 of
 touch
 and
 then
 he'd


find
 out
 whether
 he
 had
 been
 in
 my
 hair


or
 if
 I
 really
 was
 incompetent
 that's


that's
 sort
 of
 the
 way
 he
 talks
 the
 way


we
 think
 except
 he
 actually
 says
 it
 and


luckily
 for
 me
 while
 while
 he
 was
 gone


the
 Bur
 Wall
 came
 down
 I
 invested
 in
 the


deut
 mark
 but
 I
 think
 it
 was
 lucky
 for


both
 of
 us
 I
 went
 on
 like
 the
 best
 run


I've
 had
 before
 or
 since
 for
 like
 four


years
 so
 he
 kept
 seeing
 the
 results
 so
 I


think
 he
 trusted
 my
 intuition
 only


because
 the
 record
 started
 that
 way
 do


you
 trust
 the
 intuition
 of
 your


colleagues
 now
 I
 trust
 their
 analysis


they're
 they're
 so
 much
 deeper
 and


better
 at
 analysis
 than
 I
 was


um
 but
 I
 can
 see
 the
 intuition


developing
 that
 uh
 I'm
 I'm
 probably
 as


bullish
 on
 the
 talent
 the
 equity
 talent


in
 my
 firm
 as
 I've
 been
 in
 45
 years
 so
 I


guess
 that's
 that's
 an
 ner
 of
 yes
 but


partly
 uh
 brain
 partly
 analytics
 and


then
 partly
 intuition
 they're
 not
 as


intuitive
 as
 I
 am
 because
 it'll
 have
 to


be
 I
 was
 sort
 of
 forced
 to
 be
 intuitive


because
 I
 don't
 I
 never
 acquire
 their


analytical
 skills
 you
 mentioned
 some


examples
 of
 where
 you
 had
 sold
 um
 a
 bit


early
 do
 you
 do
 you
 generally
 sell
 early


no
 I
 mean
 embarrassingly
 I
 I
 did
 an


interview
 on
 Nvidia
 I
 think
 it
 was
 like


370
 or
 something
 and
 I
 said
 this
 is
 one


we're
 probably
 going
 to
 own
 for
 a
 few


years
 but
 I
 didn't
 think
 it
 was
 going
 to


go
 to
 900
 in
 a
 year
 uh
 and
 to
 over
 a$2


trillion
 market
 cap
 I
 think
 it
 started


like
 100
 billion
 or
 150
 billion
 it
 was


something
 crazy
 um


so
 no
 I
 don't
 necessarily
 sell
 early
 I'm


a
 technician
 so
 I
 usually
 wait
 for
 Tops


um
 Nvidia
 had
 no
 top
 I
 just
 thought
 um


what
 does
 that
 just
 want
 to
 explain
 what


does
 it
 mean
 to
 have
 a
 top
 a
 top
 is


something
 the
 rate
 of
 change
 of
 it's


going
 up
 changes
 and
 it
 tends
 to
 flatten


out
 for
 quite
 some
 time
 the
 trick
 is
 in


the
 technical
 world
 that
 could
 end
 up


being
 a
 bull
 flag
 where
 it
 just


Consolidated
 for
 a
 bit
 and
 then
 did
 a


new
 leg
 or
 it
 could
 be
 a
 top
 where
 that


was
 it
 that
 was
 it
 and
 how
 do
 you
 know


which
 is
 which
 you
 don't
 you
 have
 an


opinion
 and
 um
 you
 express
 it
 and


sometimes
 you're
 right
 and
 sometimes


you're
 wrong
 with


Nvidia
 um
 there
 was
 no
 top
 but
 I
 just


I've
 I've
 analyzed
 the
 semiconductors


industry
 not
 particularly
 well
 but
 since


the


1970s
 and
 it's
 a
 cycal
 industry
 m
 and
 I


knew
 Nvidia
 had
 staying
 power
 and
 was


they
 had
 4,000
 software
 Engineers
 so
 it


wasn't
 just
 Hardware
 you
 know
 they
 have


a
 Cuda
 this
 thing
 called
 cuda
 software


that
 they
 do
 to
 to
 make
 their
 gpus
 but
 I


just
 thought
 once
 it
 went
 through
 two


trillion
 this
 is
 just
 too
 much
 and
 worst


case
 it'll
 have
 a
 big
 correction
 I'll


get
 another
 chance
 and
 of
 course
 I


didn't
 get
 another
 chance
 oh
 you
 may
 yes


I
 may
 you
 think
 you
 will
 uh
 I
 don't
 know


from
 this
 price
 I
 assume
 I
 will
 or
 would


have
 bought
 it
 back
 I
 don't
 mind
 buying


something
 back
 higher
 than
 I
 would
 I


don't
 like
 it
 but
 I'm
 perfectly
 willing


to
 buy
 something
 back
 higher
 than
 I
 sold


it
 some
 people
 can't
 get
 themselves
 do


it
 oh
 I
 can
 I'm
 the
 one
 thing
 I'm
 strong


on
 is
 I'm
 not
 emotional
 but
 um
 you
 never


had
 a
 down
 a
 no
 stupid
 question
 why
 is


that
 important
 no
 good
 reason
 I
 think


it's
 it's
 important
 because
 other
 people


talk
 about
 it
 and
 uh
 my
 investors
 loved


it
 one
 ah
 had
 of
 investors
 because
 um


you
 know
 they
 have
 this
 stuff
 in
 our


industry
 you
 know
 called
 risk
 weighted


return
 I'm
 not
 big
 on
 that
 but
 I
 will


say
 it's
 a
 stressful
 job
 and
 there's


less
 stress
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 big
 draw


Downs
 I
 have
 had
 significant
 draw
 Downs


in
 inner
 year
 so
 part
 of
 the
 down
 year


is
 just
 luck
 what
 does
 a
 draw
 down
 do
 to


you
 I
 get
 uh
 anxious
 upset
 uh
 you
 get


upet
 even
 though
 it's
 only
 your
 money


yes
 yeah
 I'm
 just


um
 I'm
 a
 very
 competitive
 person
 even
 if


it's
 just
 my
 own
 money
 I
 I
 wish
 I
 wasn't


but
 I
 am
 and
 uh
 it's
 probably
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 my
 results
 are
 as
 good
 as
 they


are
 but
 I
 prefer
 myself
 not
 to
 be
 um


it's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 sickness
 but
 it
 works


for
 me
 who
 do
 you
 compete
 against
 I


compete
 against
 what
 I
 would
 call
 the


opportunity
 set
 and
 if
 there
 was
 a
 great


opportunity
 set
 that
 year
 and
 I
 missed


it
 um
 I'm
 disappointed
 in
 my
 myself
 like


if
 I'm
 up
 20
 and
 I
 think
 I
 should
 have


been
 up
 50
 I'm
 disappointed
 in
 myself
 if


the
 opportunity
 set
 was
 basically
 to
 be


up
 10
 or
 15
 and
 an
 up
 20
 I'm
 thrilled
 I


mean
 the
 good
 the
 good
 thing
 about
 being


an
 investor
 is
 always
 a
 good
 reason
 to


hit
 yourself
 in
 a
 head
 right
 I
 don't


know
 if
 that's
 a
 good
 thing
 about
 our


business
 but
 it's
 it's
 probably
 the
 bad


thing
 about
 our
 business
 and
 for
 some


reason
 I
 like
 to
 hit
 myself
 in
 the
 head


I
 always
 measure
 from
 the
 top
 but
 you
 um


are
 quick
 at
 selling
 your
 losers


what's
 the
 key
 to
 that
 if
 the
 reason
 I


bought
 a


stock
 is
 no
 longer
 the
 case
 I
 don't
 care


what
 I
 paid
 for
 it
 and
 if
 I
 bought
 it
 at


60
 and
 it's
 50
 because
 the
 markets


discovered
 the
 problem
 before
 me
 I
 have


I
 have
 no
 emotion
 whatsoever
 um
 Soros


was
 the
 same
 way
 I
 didn't
 really
 learn


it
 from
 him
 but
 it
 was
 certainly


reinforced
 like
 after
 a
 while
 Nikolai


you
 all
 so
 develop
 enough
 confidence


that
 you're
 not
 afraid
 to
 clean
 the


slate
 and
 start
 over
 cuz
 you
 have
 the


confidence
 that
 you'll
 be
 successful


again
 and
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 sit
 there


in
 a
 lazy
 position
 that
 you're
 not
 that


sure
 about
 anymore
 just
 clean
 house
 and


if
 you've
 been
 doing
 it
 for
 decades
 and


it's
 worked
 you
 kind
 of
 have
 the


confidence
 to
 take
 a
 loss
 and
 not
 worry


about
 it
 too


much
 once
 I'm
 out
 I'm
 out
 you
 said
 you


don't
 have
 feelings
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do


you
 mean
 by
 that
 did
 I
 say
 don't
 have


feelings
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 feelings
 you


mean
 about
 taking
 losses
 yeah
 just
 what


I
 mean
 by
 that
 is
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 charts
 work
 we
 have
 the
 reason


there's
 support
 and
 there's
 um
 there's


resistance
 is
 the
 resistance
 is
 a
 bunch


of
 people
 that
 bought
 it
 at
 60
 and
 it


went
 down
 and
 they've
 been
 waiting
 for


three
 or
 four
 years
 for
 it
 to
 get
 back


to
 60
 while
 they
 could
 have
 been
 in


something
 else
 that
 was
 going
 up
 the


whole
 time
 um
 I
 just
 don't
 care


what
 I
 paid
 for
 a
 stock
 it's
 absolutely


irrelevant
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 my
 investment


process
 going
 forward
 now
 this
 uh


combination
 of
 being
 on
 the
 one
 hand


stubborn
 but
 other
 hand
 being
 able
 to


change
 your


mind
 it's
 pretty
 rare
 I'm
 told
 it
 is


yeah
 I
 told
 by
 my
 friends
 and
 other


investors
 that


I'm


entirely
 unemotional
 and


like
 yes
 I
 am
 told
 it's
 rare
 is
 that
 the


key
 to
 your
 success
 you
 think
 one
 of


them


I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 think
 it's
 a


big
 part
 of
 it
 I
 think
 again
 um
 being


being
 open-minded
 and
 having
 humility


the
 only
 reason
 you
 can
 change
 your
 mind


is
 if
 you're
 not
 arrogant
 about
 a


position
 has
 mattered
 I
 think
 I
 had
 some


great
 mentors
 the
 one
 in
 Pittsburgh
 and


then
 Soros
 in
 terms
 of
 sizing
 and
 I


think
 I
 learned
 some
 lessons
 very
 early


on
 uh


concentration
 not
 to
 be
 afraid
 of


concentration
 that
 that's
 a
 big
 reason


for
 my
 success
 and
 probably
 the
 other


big
 reason
 was
 sort
 of
 self-taught


is
 being
 willing
 to
 go
 into
 other
 asset


categories
 and
 if
 you're
 going
 to


concentrate
 it's
 better
 to
 have
 five


buckets
 to
 plan
 than
 to
 plan
 one
 so
 I


was
 brought
 up
 in
 the
 equity
 Market
 but


sometimes
 the
 risk
 reward
 in
 the
 equity


Market
 is
 not
 that
 clear
 when
 it


actually
 is
 clear
 clearing
 the
 bond


market
 or
 the
 currency


markets
 and
 it's
 a
 coincidence
 you
 asked


about
 never
 h
 a
 down
 year
 part
 of
 it
 is


the
 most
 action
 in
 bonds
 and
 currencies


tends
 to
 happen
 in
 bare
 markets
 and


Equity
 markets
 so
 you
 can
 put
 the
 put


the
 equities
 in
 the
 drawer
 for
 a
 while


and
 just
 concentrate
 in
 those
 markets
 I


think
 that's
 been
 a
 huge
 part
 of
 my


successes
 is
 it
 gives
 you
 the
 discipline


not
 to
 play
 in
 areas
 that
 you
 don't
 have


a
 lot
 of
 conviction
 in
 because
 if
 you


got
 credit
 to
 play
 in
 if
 you
 got


Commodities
 to
 play
 in
 currencies
 or


bonds
 you
 can
 usually
 find
 something


that
 you
 think
 there's
 a
 great
 risk


award
 in
 it's
 also
 they
 tend
 to
 be
 more


liquid
 than
 Equity
 markets
 so
 to
 our


earlier
 conversation
 you
 can
 change
 your


mind
 when
 you're
 wrong
 what
 do
 you
 learn


about
 siing
 from
 Source
 I
 don't
 know


whether
 you
 know
 about
 do
 you
 know


baseball
 at
 all
 or
 would
 your
 listen


about
 I
 don't
 play
 it
 but
 uh
 when
 I
 went


to
 Soros
 I
 thought
 I
 would
 learn
 what


would
 make
 de
 Mark
 go
 up
 in
 the
 end
 go


up
 and
 modestly
 I
 found
 I
 was
 better
 at


that
 than
 him
 um
 in
 baseball
 terms
 I


have
 a
 I
 had
 a
 very
 high
 batting
 average


he
 had
 a
 much
 higher
 slugging
 percentage


um
 so
 what
 I
 learned
 from


Soros
 is
 when
 you
 have


conviction
 you
 should
 bet
 really
 big
 I


know
 your
 listeners
 have
 probably
 heard


it
 before
 but
 I
 but
 probably
 the
 best


illustration
 is
 the
 pound
 yeah
 so
 what


happened
 so
 let's
 go
 back
 so
 you
 are
 in


the
 office
 what's
 happening
 in
 the
 UK
 so


I'm
 in
 the
 office
 in
 New
 York
 and
 Scott


bessent
 um
 who
 was
 a
 partner
 of
 mine
 in


Europe
 mainly
 trade
 the
 European
 area


he's
 in
 London
 and
 he
 tells
 me
 the


London
 housing
 market
 is
 in
 big
 trouble


and
 the
 British
 economy
 is
 in
 trouble


because
 like
 most
 Anglo
 sex
 and


economies
 at
 the
 time
 it's
 very
 much


driven
 by
 housing
 and
 so
 forth
 Just
 P
 it


out
 a
 bit
 so
 your
 office
 are
 you
 like


overlooking
 Central
 Park


uh
 I'm
 not
 overlooking
 Central
 Park
 but


I'm
 near
 it
 I
 I'm
 in
 the
 Soros
 office
 on


32nd
 Floor
 but
 it's
 okay
 it's
 not
 a


corner
 office
 it's
 nothing
 big
 fail
 see


and
 the
 UK
 economy
 is
 going
 down
 the


toilet
 we
 think
 the
 U
 econom
 is
 going


down
 but
 I
 need
 to
 take
 you
 back


about
 3
 years
 when
 the
 Berlin
 Wall
 cam


comes
 down
 it'll
 probably
 save
 me
 my
 job


cuz
 I
 probably
 would
 have
 been
 fir
 at


Soros
 6
 months
 after
 he
 went
 to
 Eastern


Europe
 had
 the
 Berlin
 wallnut
 come
 down


but
 um
 the
 de
 Mark
 went
 down
 for
 two


days
 dramatically
 because
 the
 theory
 in


the
 market
 was
 the
 osmark
 which
 was
 the


East
 German
 currency
 was
 going
 to


pollute
 the
 deut
 Mark
 I
 knew
 German


history
 and
 knew
 they
 were
 obsessed
 with


inflation
 because
 the
 viar
 Republic
 and


then
 that
 led
 to
 Hitler
 and
 so
 forth
 and


so
 on
 so
 I
 knew
 the
 Germans
 were


absolutely
 obsessed
 with
 inflation
 I


knew
 that
 all
 bringing
 all
 these
 East


Germans
 into
 the
 labor
 Supply
 was
 going


to
 cause
 a
 boom
 in
 the
 economy
 so
 we


were
 very
 bullish
 on
 the
 overall
 German


economy
 and
 we
 were
 very


convinced
 that
 there
 is
 no
 way
 the


bundes
 bank
 would
 let
 inflation
 so
 we're


very
 convinced
 it
 would
 be
 accompanied


by
 tight
 monetary
 policy
 so
 we
 had


shorted
 the
 Italian
 L


successfully
 um
 during
 that
 per
 period


so
 when
 the
 when
 Scott
 called
 me
 we
 were


already
 sort
 of
 on
 this
 deark
 journey


we've
 been
 for
 a
 few


years
 and
 the
 British
 econom
 is
 going


down
 and
 new
 currencies
 are
 linked
 so
 it


was
 a
 peg
 right
 it
 was
 a
 peg
 so
 um
 I


called
 and
 asked
 how
 much
 it
 would
 cost


me
 to
 Short
 the
 pound
 versus
 the
 deut


mark
 for
 six
 months
 it
 was
 a
 half
 a


percent
 I
 think
 the
 fund
 was
 around
 7


and
 a
 half
 billion
 at
 the
 time
 Quantum


fund
 and
 I
 decided
 to
 do
 an
 invest
 and


then
 investigate
 position
 so
 I
 did
 a


billion
 and
 a
 half
 or
 like
 20
 25%
 of
 the


fund
 short
 the
 pound
 long
 the
 deut
 mark


figuring
 I'd
 probably
 lose
 a
 half
 per


because
 it's
 a
 Peg
 and
 it
 won't
 break


within
 6
 months
 but
 I
 wanted
 the


position
 on
 Fast
 Forward
 probably
 about


five
 or
 six
 weeks
 the
 day
 I
 believe
 was


September
 15th
 not
 that
 I
 would
 remember


um


I
 read
 the
 financial
 times
 and
 the
 head


of
 the
 bunis


bank
 now
 I'm
 sure
 I'm
 age
 but
 I'm
 pretty


sure
 it
 was
 te
 Meer
 has
 written
 an


editorial
 in
 the
 financial
 times


basically
 in
 more
 proper
 language
 but


he's
 basically
 saying
 that
 the
 deark
 and


the
 pound
 should
 no
 longer
 be
 linked
 so


I
 decide
 to
 take
 Duan
 and
 the
 quantum


fund
 to
 100%
 long
 the
 deark


short
 the
 pound
 because
 it's
 still
 a


half
 a
 perc
 unbelievably
 now
 you're


going
 to
 hear
 vintage
 Soros
 so
 he


happens
 to
 be
 in
 New
 York
 at
 the
 time


which
 he
 wasn't
 always
 I
 go
 into
 his


office
 and
 I
 explain
 to


him
 why
 I'm
 going
 to


100%
 And
 he
 had
 a
 rather
 large
 personal


account
 that's
 how
 we
 kept
 each
 other


out
 of
 each
 other's
 hair
 he
 traded
 that


and
 you
 know
 it
 was
 90
 90
 95%
 overlap


told
 him
 why
 I
 was
 doing
 this
 and
 he
 had


this
 um
 unpleasant
 puzzled
 look
 on
 his


face
 when
 I'm
 telling
 him
 my
 thesis
 that


this
 one
 economy
 is
 booming
 and
 they


need
 higher
 rates
 this
 other
 economy
 is


falling
 apart
 they
 need
 lower
 rates


that's
 these
 two
 currencies
 shouldn't
 be


linked
 and
 I'm
 thinking
 what
 does
 he
 not


understand
 about
 this
 because
 this
 guy


pretty
 much
 understood


everything
 and
 he
 says
 uh
 look
 this
 is


uh
 this
 is
 a
 one-way
 bet
 they
 come
 along


very
 very
 rarely
 it's
 ridiculous
 doing


100%
 we
 should
 put
 200%
 of
 the
 fund
 in


this


trade
 so
 there
 you
 have
 it
 so
 that
 means


that
 you
 borrow
 money
 in
 the
 bank
 and


double
 up
 yeah
 on
 a
 $7.5
 billion
 fund
 he


thought
 we
 should
 have
 $15


billion
 short
 the
 pound
 long
 the


deark
 um
 it
 turns
 out
 we
 never
 got
 there


but
 it
 shows
 the
 way
 the
 man
 thinks
 I


saw
 it
 over
 and
 over
 again
 because
 you


once
 you
 were
 trading
 the
 thing
 happened


yeah
 unfortunately
 we
 had
 a
 we
 had
 a


pretty
 strong
 reputation
 and
 when
 I


started
 selling
 it
 that
 night
 I
 noticed


a
 lot
 of
 other
 hedge
 funds
 started


selling
 at
 the
 gossip
 community
 and
 the


currency
 markets
 and
 by
 midnight
 to
 1:00


the
 Fords
 had
 blown
 out
 they'd
 started


they
 at
 a
 half
 a
 percent
 they
 were
 like


6
 or
 7%
 and
 it
 basically
 wasn't
 trading


after
 1:00
 in
 the
 morning


then
 the
 British
 raised
 rates
 I
 think


from
 6
 to
 9
 to
 try
 and
 stop
 the
 bleeding


and
 then
 they
 went
 to
 12
 I
 knew
 it
 was


over
 but
 the
 forward
 to
 rout
 so
 much


didn't
 matter
 and
 it
 was
 it
 was
 done
 by


noon
 the
 next
 day
 and
 you
 were
 sitting


at
 your
 desk
 looking
 at
 the
 royter


screen
 yes
 or
 whatever
 the
 screen
 at
 the


time
 was
 we
 only
 got
 7
 and
 a
 half


billion
 done
 ironically
 well
 I
 have
 to


had
 it
 not
 been
 for
 Soros
 I
 probably


would
 have
 not
 got
 to
 the
 7
 and
 a
 half


cuz
 you
 know
 intending
 to
 do
 15
 I
 was
 in


a
 bigger
 hurry
 so
 what
 did
 you
 feel
 when


when
 he
 broke
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of


adrenaline
 um
 it
 was
 exciting
 I
 didn't


feel
 bad
 because
 I
 thought
 the
 British


economy
 needed
 it
 I
 was
 gratified
 years


later
 when
 they
 changed
 it
 from
 black


Wednesday
 to
 White
 Wednesday
 then
 I
 went


into
 action
 after
 it
 broke
 because
 the


guilts
 were
 down
 two
 points
 which
 I


thought
 was


ridiculous
 British
 needed
 lower
 rates


there's
 some
 theory
 in
 the
 Academia
 that


if
 you
 have
 a
 weak
 currency
 your


interest
 rates
 have
 to
 go
 up
 so
 I
 bought


guilts
 I
 bought
 British
 stocks
 there
 was


a
 whole
 because
 what
 happened
 was
 that


the
 currency
 depreciated
 and
 it
 was
 good


for
 exports
 right
 so
 the
 stocks
 went
 up


afterwards
 the
 stocks
 went
 up
 the
 guilts


went
 up
 because
 they
 needed
 lower
 rates


and
 you
 know
 they'd
 been
 held


artificially
 high
 so
 there
 was
 all
 kinds


of
 other
 stuff
 I
 did
 around
 it
 uh
 which


is
 kind
 of
 the
 way
 I
 trade
 you
 get
 a


theme
 and
 then
 you
 look
 at
 the


concentric
 circles
 or
 the
 or
 The


Dominoes
 that
 fall
 because
 of
 a


theme
 and
 but
 the
 point
 was
 with
 Soros


if
 he
 really
 believe
 something
 the


position
 could
 be
 never
 be
 big
 enough


yeah
 particularly
 if
 it's
 in
 a
 liquid


market
 and
 I
 learned
 from
 him
 I
 like
 to


play
 the
 turn
 maybe
 my
 ego
 in
 in
 a
 in
 a


big
 turn
 in
 something
 he
 was
 perfectly


happy
 to
 play
 from
 the
 third
 to
 the


sixth
 inning
 if
 we
 go
 back
 to
 baseball


terms
 of
 it's
 a
 nine
 inning
 game
 he
 was


perfectly
 happy
 to
 play
 the
 third
 to


sixth
 inning
 when
 there
 was
 more


certainty
 on
 much
 greater
 leverage
 he


had
 more
 courage
 than
 I
 did
 in
 terms
 of


sizing
 positions
 I
 don't
 think
 it


totally
 rubbed
 off
 on
 me
 but
 it


certainly
 helped
 and
 it
 it
 was
 a
 huge


learning
 experience
 I
 think
 the
 major


thing
 I
 learned
 with
 him
 is
 it's
 not


whether
 you're
 right
 or
 wrong
 it's
 how


much
 you
 make
 when
 you're
 right
 and
 how


much
 you
 lose
 when
 you're
 wrong
 and


that's
 what
 he
 was
 probably
 as
 good
 as


anybody
 who's
 ever
 been
 at
 Stan
 um
 many


people
 have
 heard
 about
 the
 pound
 but
 um


not
 many
 people
 know
 that
 you
 also
 did


the
 Swedish
 Groner
 yes
 um
 my
 memory's
 a


little


less
 clear
 on
 that
 one
 as
 to
 the


reasoning
 but
 it
 was
 just


another
 another
 victim
 of
 the
 deark
 yeah


um
 I
 assume
 there
 was
 some
 kind
 of


Divergence
 between
 the
 two
 economies
 and


and
 there
 was
 a
 peg
 that
 I
 thought
 was


inappropriate
 and
 it
 turned
 out
 yeah


that
 worked
 out
 so
 you
 took
 that
 Peg
 too


but
 you
 took
 another
 Peg
 too
 because
 I


thought
 you
 were
 also
 involved
 with
 the


tibot
 yeah
 the
 tibot
 was
 easy
 they
 they


um
 but
 but
 nobody
 knows
 about
 this
 right


no
 I
 think
 um
 Sebastian
 Malby
 wrote
 a


book
 called
 more
 money
 than
 God
 there's


a
 whole
 chapter
 on
 the
 tibot
 that
 was


not
 on
 the
 Swedish
 croner
 no
 the
 Swedish


croner
 no
 no
 I
 prefer
 nobody
 knew
 any
 of


this
 stuff
 but
 well
 we
 need
 to
 get
 it


right
 for
 the
 history
 books
 I'm
 happy
 to


talk
 about
 it
 25
 years
 later
 any
 trades


you
 regret
 not
 making
 oh


there's
 there's
 trades
 I
 regret
 not


making
 um
 constantly
 I'd
 say
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 mistakes
 I
 made
 was
 having


predicted
 the
 inflation
 really
 early
 and


feeling
 so
 strongly
 about
 it
 I
 wrote
 a


piece
 in
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 with
 my


partner
 Christian
 broa
 in
 the
 spring
 of


21
 I
 had
 a
 mass
 of
 short
 for
 me
 in
 two


years
 um
 sort
 of
 like
 we
 just
 talked


about
 with
 the
 pound
 it
 was
 a
 one-way


bet
 they
 were
 15
 basis
 points
 and
 I
 was


so
 measured
 by
 where
 they'd
 win
 where


they'd
 been
 I
 took
 most
 of
 them
 off
 at


like
 150
 basis
 points
 it
 seemed
 like
 a


great
 win
 from
 15
 to
 basis
 point
 to
 150


but
 as
 you
 know
 they
 went
 to
 500
 I


regret
 deeply
 not
 holding
 that
 position


there's
 probably
 30
 others
 but
 I
 prefer


to
 forget
 my
 mistakes
 do
 you
 think


machines
 can
 take
 the
 place
 of
 humans


when
 it
 comes
 to
 investing
 no
 I
 don't


but
 I
 think
 they
 can
 work
 um
 as
 a
 CO


co-pilot
 and
 the
 combination
 can
 beat


anything
 a
 mere
 human
 could
 be
 I'm
 lucky


enough
 to
 have
 known
 Gary
 caspro
 for
 a


long
 time
 I'm
 co-founder
 of
 the
 casprov


chess


Foundation
 um
 for
 no
 good
 reason
 I
 I
 I


can
 hardly
 play
 chess
 my
 9-year-old


daughter
 was
 beating
 me
 that's
 how
 I


started
 with
 Gary
 but
 um
 he
 was
 probably


one
 of
 the
 first
 guys
 to
 use
 machines
 to


train
 himself
 and
 work
 with
 them
 I
 could


see
 the
 same
 thing
 happening
 with
 money


management
 so
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 pure


machines
 they'll
 make
 money
 because
 they


have
 a
 disciplined
 process
 and
 there's


math
 but
 I
 think
 if
 you
 could
 find
 an


intuitive
 investor
 who's
 using
 Ai
 and


other
 things
 to
 supplement
 I
 think
 that


would
 probably
 be
 the
 top
 investor
 in


the
 world
 not
 a
 machine
 now
 you
 took
 um


sabatical
 in
 200000
 yeah
 what
 was
 the


reason
 behind


that
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 painful
 but
 really


fun
 story
 um
 it
 really
 it
 really


starts
 in


1998
 well
 no
 it
 starts
 in
 the
 spring
 of


1999
 I
 shorted
 I
 think
 it
 was
 11
 or
 12


internet
 stocks
 not
 the
 leaders
 like
 aoi


or
 Yahoo
 but
 the
 also
 rans
 and
 I
 I


believe
 the
 position
 was
 like
 $200


million
 and
 in
 like
 four


weeks
 I
 had
 lost
 like
 $600
 million
 so
 it


was
 the
 first
 time
 I'd
 ever
 had
 a
 big


draw
 down
 I
 was
 down
 like
 16
 or


7%
 in
 the
 spring
 of
 99
 I
 then
 pivoted


and
 realized
 that
 green
 span
 e
 because


of
 the
 agent
 financial
 crisis
 while
 our


economy
 was
 strong
 and
 we
 had
 the


internet
 and
 all
 this
 behind
 it
 I
 went


out
 and
 hired
 um
 a
 couple
 of
 young


managers
 to
 buy
 tech
 stocks
 that
 I


didn't
 know
 how
 to
 spell
 they
 had
 their


own
 little
 accounts
 and
 like
 I
 would


plow
 in
 on
 top
 of
 their


positions
 and
 we
 ended
 up
 the
 year
 I


think
 something
 like
 42
 net
 or
 something


after
 being
 in
 this
 deole
 because
 you


know
 I
 rode
 this
 crazy
 n
 sck
 wave
 in
 99


so
 then
 uh
 in
 January
 I
 just
 said
 this


is
 ridiculous
 and
 um
 I
 sold
 out
 all
 my


tech
 Holdings
 like
 I
 can't
 remember
 it


was
 like
 they
 had
 grown
 to
 like
 $


billion
 dollar
 or
 it
 was
 it
 was
 enormous


for
 that
 period
 of
 time
 and
 I
 actually


went
 and
 told
 Soros
 why
 I
 had
 sold
 them


out
 and
 next
 thing
 that
 happens
 the
 two


little
 satellites
 inside
 they
 don't
 sell


out
 they're
 gamblers
 I
 don't
 really
 care


cuz
 quantum's
 huge
 and
 they're
 this


little
 thing
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 affect


the
 performance
 that
 much
 but
 Nikolai


they're
 making
 like
 four
 to
 5%
 a
 day
 I


mean
 the
 market
 is
 still
 roaring
 going


into
 March
 and
 I'm
 uh
 I'm
 watching
 this


and
 I'm


getting
 really
 annoyed
 with
 myself
 that


I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 still
 in
 this
 trade
 and


then
 uh
 around
 early
 March
 I
 can't
 take


it
 anymore
 and
 I
 told
 you
 earlier
 I'm


not
 emotional
 this
 was
 this
 was
 a
 real


emotional
 really
 dumb
 move
 um
 I
 buy


everything


back
 I
 think
 I
 missed
 the
 top
 by
 about


an


hour
 so
 I
 buy
 back
 all
 these
 tech


stocks
 and
 within
 a
 week
 I
 know
 I'm
 dead


and
 Quantum
 goes
 from
 like
 up
 14%
 to
 up


1%
 in
 a


week
 and
 I
 go
 in
 and
 I
 now
 I've
 already


been
 through
 the
 trauma
 of
 the
 spring


before
 I
 recovered
 from
 it
 but
 it
 it
 had


a
 big
 effect
 on
 me
 the
 the
 stress
 I
 had


young
 kids
 you
 know
 and
 it's
 like
 a


repeat
 of
 the
 year
 before
 so
 I
 go
 into


Soros
 and
 I
 tell
 them
 two
 things
 a
 I'm


getting
 out
 of
 all
 this
 stuff
 B
 uh
 I'm


quitting
 um
 we
 can't
 tell
 anybody
 cuz
 I


got
 I
 got
 to
 liquidate
 this
 portfolio


but
 the
 NASDAQ
 is
 in
 the
 beginning
 wave


of
 a
 Down
 90%
 move
 and
 you
 can't
 get
 out


so
 by
 the
 time
 I
 get
 out
 takes
 a
 few


weeks
 the
 fund
 is
 down
 like


177%
 and
 duain
 is
 down


177%
 and
 uh
 I'm
 just
 exhausted
 I've
 been


running
 this
 high-profile
 fund
 for
 12


years
 so
 I
 sell
 everything
 out


everything
 of


duaine
 send
 my
 investors
 a
 letter
 and


say
 uh
 I'm
 going
 on
 a
 sabatical
 I
 don't


know
 whether
 I'm
 coming
 back
 or
 not
 you


can
 take
 all
 your
 money
 out
 but
 if
 you


take
 your
 money
 out
 if
 I
 decide
 to
 come


back
 I
 can't
 guarantee
 I'll
 let
 you
 back


in
 I
 think
 I
 had
 like
 200
 clients
 one
 of


them
 pulled
 their
 money
 I
 remember
 who


it
 was
 but
 they'll
 remain
 anonymous
 for


now


so
 I
 I
 shut
 everything
 down
 I
 go
 to


Africa
 with
 my
 wife
 and
 kids
 and
 the


best
 thing
 I
 did
 is
 during
 the
 summer
 I


refused
 to
 expose
 myself
 in
 any
 way
 to


something
 that
 would
 tell
 me
 where
 the


markets
 were
 so
 I'm
 not
 allowed
 to
 watch


TV
 I'm
 not
 allowed
 to
 see
 the
 Wall


Street
 Journal
 prices
 nothing
 so
 I
 come


back
 in
 labor
 day
 I
 think
 my
 wife


couldn't
 have
 handled
 me
 being
 around
 uh


once
 the
 kids
 go
 back
 to


school
 uh
 sort
 of
 humor
 maybe
 not
 uh


so
 I
 come
 back
 and
 it's
 remarkable


because
 the
 S&P
 has
 rallied
 back
 almost


to
 the
 high
 the
 nasdaq's
 retrace
 about


85%
 of
 the
 decline
 but
 the
 dollar
 is
 up


interest
 rates
 are
 up
 and
 oil
 is
 up


three
 death
 nails
 for
 markets
 if
 you


look
 at
 history
 so
 I
 then
 start
 calling


all
 my
 clients
 who
 are
 basically
 small


businessmen
 they're
 not
 fancy


institutions
 and
 all
 their


businesses
 are
 terrible


so
 then
 I
 call
 Ed
 Heyman
 and
 I
 say
 he


Equity
 strategists
 microeconomist
 yeah


he's
 probably
 was
 the
 number
 one


institutional
 guy
 whatever
 that
 rating


Institutional
 Investor


Economist
 and
 um
 I
 say
 this
 is
 very
 odd


and
 I've
 been
 out
 of
 touch
 dollars
 up


blah
 blah
 blah
 blah
 and
 uh
 two
 days


later
 in
 his
 daily
 missive
 he
 has


regression
 analysis
 and
 it
 says
 um
 it's


50%
 I
 think
 currency
 25%
 oil
 and
 25%


interest
 rates
 and
 it
 looks
 one
 year


forward
 and
 it
 predicts
 earnings
 and


it's
 predicting
 that
 earnings
 are
 going


to
 decline
 36%
 the
 next
 year
 and
 the


Wall
 Street
 consensuses
 are
 going
 to
 go


up
 18%
 so
 combination
 of
 that
 listening


to
 my
 clients
 the
 fact
 that
 Greenspan


got
 a
 tightening
 directive
 on
 which
 I


think
 is
 inappropriate


I
 start
 buying
 all
 these


treasuries
 and
 the
 market
 doesn't
 go
 my


way
 but
 all
 the
 information
 keeps
 going


so
 I
 keep
 buying
 more
 and
 more
 and
 more


and
 more
 so
 now
 I
 have
 a
 350%
 tenure


equivalent
 in
 the
 fund
 and
 then
 I
 get


lucky
 with
 the
 gore
 Bush


Fiasco
 economy
 falls
 apart
 I
 end
 up


making
 40%
 in
 the
 fourth
 quarter
 so
 I


had
 I
 had
 written
 the
 year
 off
 I
 I
 when


I
 came
 back
 I'm
 down
 18
 I
 assume
 okay
 at


least
 I
 got
 don't
 have
 to
 worry
 about


this
 anymore
 i'
 finally
 going
 to
 have
 it


down
 year
 and
 it's
 like
 the
 best
 quarter


I
 ever
 had
 and
 to
 this
 day
 if
 I
 had


stayed
 managing
 money
 I
 think
 I'd
 been


tied
 of
 knots
 and
 there's
 no
 way
 I
 would


make
 that
 trade
 it
 was
 the
 fact
 that
 I


was
 a
 raid
 for
 four
 months
 had
 a
 clean


slate
 had
 a
 clear
 head
 and
 just
 looked


at
 the
 New


Evidence
 so
 it
 was
 a
 very
 very
 very


horrible
 beginning
 and
 a
 very
 lucky


ending
 now
 you
 don't
 take
 um
 four
 months


off
 very
 often
 uh
 you
 work
 very
 hard


when
 do
 you
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning
 4
 4


in
 the
 morning
 yeah
 what
 do
 you
 do
 uh
 I


you
 have
 you
 have
 an
 an
 office
 at
 home


right
 yeah
 yeah
 I
 immediately
 go
 to
 the


Bloomberg
 and
 4:00
 you
 do
 you
 make
 a
 cup


of
 coffee
 before
 you
 go
 to
 Bloomberg
 or


straight
 to
 Bloomberg
 yes
 no
 yeah
 I
 make


a
 cup
 of
 coffee
 I
 go
 up
 I
 don't
 shower


yet
 check
 all
 the
 markets
 read
 the


journal


skim
 the
 financial
 times
 skim
 the
 New


York
 Times
 check
 like
 all
 the
 emails


overnight
 when
 I
 say
 check
 I
 mean
 skim


them
 for
 the
 important
 ones
 then
 it's


probably
 uh
 5:15
 or
 5:30
 take
 a
 shower


go
 to
 work
 start
 all
 over
 again
 when
 you


go
 to
 bed
 uh
 usually
 around
 8:30
 qu
 or
 9


as
 soon
 as
 I
 see
 Japan
 what's
 happening


you
 basically
 live
 according
 to


financial
 markets
 yes
 uh
 my


mother-in-law
 said
 a
 long
 time
 ago
 I'm


an
 idiot
 savant
 she
 thought
 she
 was


joking
 but
 she's
 correct
 it's
 the
 only


thing
 I'm
 really
 good
 at
 I
 really
 enjoy


it
 keeps
 me
 young
 I'm
 dealing
 with


brilliant
 young
 people
 here
 as
 analysts


but
 also
 I
 forc
 to
 read
 the
 newspaper


and
 forc
 to
 learn
 about
 these
 waves
 and


uh
 keeps
 me
 stimulated
 I
 love
 it
 now
 you


are
 71
 right
 yes
 and
 you
 will
 continue


until
 you
 until
 you
 die
 you
 think


yes
 hopefully
 it
 won't
 be


tonight
 no
 I
 think
 probably
 not
 I
 do
 um


s
 last
 thing
 we
 got
 10
 thousands
 of


young
 people
 here
 now
 they
 want
 to
 be


like
 you
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 be


successful
 in
 financial
 markets
 what


should
 they
 be
 doing
 how
 should
 they


enter
 what
 what
 should
 they
 think
 about


first
 of
 all
 if
 they're
 going
 in
 it
 for


the
 money
 they
 should
 go
 elsewhere
 yeah


there's
 too
 many
 people
 in
 the
 business


like
 me
 that
 just
 love
 the
 game
 and
 the


passion
 for
 reasons
 I
 just


articulated
 and
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 be


to
 out
 work
 the
 people
 that
 are


passionate
 in
 the
 game
 and
 it's
 not
 a


fun
 game
 if
 you're
 losing
 it's
 horrible


I


just
 told
 you
 and
 the
 how
 I
 respond
 to


draw
 Downs
 so
 but
 if
 they
 have
 a
 passion


for
 it
 if
 I
 was
 a
 young
 person
 I
 would


not
 get
 an
 MBA
 I'd
 go
 find
 a
 mentor
 and


if
 they
 didn't
 want
 me
 I
 would
 just


relentlessly
 bug
 the
 hell
 out
 of
 them


which
 a
 couple
 of
 have
 done
 with
 me


until
 they
 finally
 accepted
 me
 to
 go
 and


work
 for
 them
 learn
 what
 I
 could
 from


them
 if
 they
 still
 like
 the
 business


just
 keep
 trying
 to
 grow
 your
 knowledge


base
 I
 would
 say
 an
 analyst
 skill
 set
 in


our
 business
 is
 completely
 different


than
 a
 portfolio
 manager
 skill
 set
 once


in
 a
 while
 you'll
 get
 an
 overlap
 but
 I


would
 be
 careful
 if
 they
 really
 love
 the


the
 analyst
 part
 which
 is
 where
 we
 all


start
 of
 thinking
 they
 have
 to
 become
 a


portfolio
 manager
 I've
 seen
 it
 ruin


people's
 lives
 who
 weren't
 built
 for


trigger
 pulling
 so
 they
 should
 be


open-minded
 I
 got
 in
 the
 business


because
 I
 wanted
 intellectual


stimulation
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 get


plenty
 in
 either
 one
 but
 that
 would
 be


that
 would
 be
 my
 advice
 to
 them
 and
 be


open-minded
 stand
 this
 been
 a
 an
 epic


conversation
 thanks
 Nikolai
 I
 probably


said
 more
 than
 I
 should
 have
 you
 said


exact
 we
 get
 in
 too
 much
 trouble
 thank


you
