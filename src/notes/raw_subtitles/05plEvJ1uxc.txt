>> Good
 morning.
 I'm
 Nathan
 Hager


>> and
 I'm
 Karen
 Moscow.
 Here
 are
 the


stories
 we're
 following
 today.


>> Karen,
 we
 begin
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 where


Hamas
 has
 released
 all
 20
 living
 Israeli


hostages
 from
 the
 Gaza
 Strip
 after
 2


years
 of
 war.
 The
 release
 comes
 as


President
 Donald
 Trump
 has
 arrived
 in


Israel
 on
 a
 Middle
 East
 trip
 to


celebrate
 the
 ceasefire
 deal.
 Now
 from


Bloomberg
 Middle
 East
 correspondent


Juman
 Bersete.


>> President
 Trump
 has
 been
 saying
 that


this
 is
 the
 end
 of
 the
 war
 and
 this
 is


the
 beginning
 of
 peace.
 And
 so
 the


expectation
 is
 that
 that
 is
 the
 message


that
 he
 would
 like
 to
 hammer
 home.
 Uh


the
 fact
 that
 this
 really
 is
 a
 turning


point
 for
 the
 region
 and
 that
 he
 has


been
 the
 only
 US
 president.
 is
 likely
 to


say
 that
 that
 has
 been
 able
 to
 bring


about
 this
 this
 uh
 development.
 Uh
 the


war
 has
 been
 going
 on
 for
 two
 years
 now.


Multiple
 failed
 attempts
 at
 negotiations


uh
 at
 diplomacy,
 shuttle
 diplomacy
 and


things
 were
 looking
 a
 little
 hairy
 a


month
 ago
 after
 that
 DHA
 attack
 when


Israel
 went
 after
 senior
 Hamas


officials,
 senior
 negotiators
 uh


operating
 in
 in
 Doha.
 But
 since
 then,


there's
 really
 been
 a
 renewed
 optimism,


a
 renewed
 push
 uh
 out
 of
 the
 Trump


administration
 to
 bring
 about
 this


breakthrough.
 And
 all
 of
 that
 came
 to


fruition
 just
 in
 the
 last
 couple
 of


days.


>> Bloomberg's
 Janiver
 said
 she
 says
 under


the
 terms
 of
 the
 agreement,
 once
 the


hostages
 are
 freed,
 Israel
 is
 obliged
 to


release
 almost
 2,000
 Palestinian


prisoners
 and
 has
 also
 agreed
 to
 allow


much
 more
 aid
 into
 the
 devastated


Mediterranean
 territory.
 Al
 Jazer
 is


reporting
 a
 group
 of
 Palestinian


prisoners
 is
 now
 on
 buses
 on
 their
 way


to
 the
 West
 Bank
 as
 part
 of
 that


exchange.


>> Well,
 Nathan,
 there
 are
 new
 developments


on
 the
 trade
 front
 and
 that
 has
 stock


futures
 rallying
 following
 Friday's


selloff
 on
 Wall
 Street.
 Right
 now,
 S&P


futures
 are
 up
 1.4%.


The
 White
 House
 is
 signaling
 it's
 open


to
 doing
 a
 deal
 with
 China
 to
 calm
 fresh


trade
 tensions
 days
 after
 announcing
 new


100%
 tariffs
 effective
 November
 1st.
 The


relationship
 soured
 last
 week
 when
 China


announced
 new
 export
 controls
 on
 rare


earths.
 Speaking
 to
 reporters
 on
 board


Air
 Force
 One,
 the
 president
 expressed


some
 optimism.


>> I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 fine
 with


China.
 Look,
 I
 have
 a
 great
 relationship


with
 President
 Xi.
 He's
 a
 very
 tough


man.
 He's
 a
 very
 smart
 man.
 He's
 a
 great


leader
 for
 their
 country.
 He's
 a
 great


leader
 and
 I
 have
 a
 great
 relationship


with
 him.
 I
 think
 we'll
 get
 it
 set.
 I


know
 what
 happened.
 I
 really
 understand


what
 happened.
 And
 I'm
 not
 even
 saying


he's
 wrong,
 but
 then
 we
 met
 him
 with


something
 much
 tougher
 than
 what
 he
 did


to
 us.


>> And
 President
 Trump
 also
 posted
 on


social
 media,
 quote,
 "Don't
 worry
 about


China.
 It
 will
 all
 be
 fine."


>> Well,
 Karen,
 there's
 no
 end
 to
 the


spending
 standoff
 in
 Washington.
 This
 is


day
 13
 of
 the
 federal
 government


shutdown.
 And
 both
 sides
 are
 hardening


their
 positions
 after
 the
 White
 House


ordered
 the
 first
 round
 of
 permanent


layoffs
 on
 Friday.
 Vice
 President
 JD


Vance
 is
 pinning
 the
 blame
 on
 Democrats.


We're
 trying
 to
 do
 everything
 that
 we


can
 to
 ensure
 that
 low-income
 women
 and


children
 get
 the
 food
 services
 that
 they


need.
 We're
 trying
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we


pay
 our
 troops
 because
 that
 matters
 for


national
 security.
 We
 also
 want
 our


people
 to
 get
 their
 paychecks.
 That's


where
 we've
 been
 focused.
 And


unfortunately,
 what
 that
 does
 mean,


Margaret,
 is
 that
 some
 federal


bureaucrats
 are
 going
 to
 have
 to
 get


laid
 off.
 Vice
 President
 JD
 Vance


discussed
 the
 shutdown
 with
 Margaret


Brennan
 on
 CBS's
 Face
 the
 Nation
 as


heard
 on
 Bloomberg
 radio.
 But
 Democrats


are
 sticking
 to
 their
 demand
 that


Republicans
 negotiate
 an
 extension
 of


healthc
 care
 subsidies
 before
 they'll


agree
 to
 a
 stop
 gap
 spending
 bill.
 House


Minority
 Leader
 Hakee
 Jeff
 addressed


that
 on
 Fox
 News
 Sunday,
 also
 heard
 on


Bloomberg
 Radio.
 Open
 enrollment
 starts


on
 November
 1st.
 Tens
 of
 millions
 of


Americans
 are
 receiving
 notices
 right


now
 that
 their
 premiums,
 co-pays,
 and


deductibles
 are
 about
 to
 explode,
 which


is
 why
 we
 need
 to
 address
 it.
 Even


Marjorie
 Taylor
 Green
 agrees
 that
 we


have
 to
 address
 this
 health
 insurance


crisis
 right
 now.


>> House
 Democratic
 leader
 Hakee
 Jeff.
 And


as
 the
 shutdown
 continues,
 military


service
 members
 are
 set
 to
 miss
 their


first
 paychecks
 on
 Wednesday.
 President


Trump
 says
 his
 administration
 has
 found


the
 funds
 to
 pay
 them,
 but
 it's
 not


clear
 if
 they'll
 receive
 full
 paychecks


or
 whether
 the
 president
 has
 the
 legal


authority
 to
 deliver
 them.


>> Let's
 go
 to
 Europe
 now,
 Nathan.
 And


President
 Mcron
 has
 announced
 a
 new


French
 cabinet,
 including
 his
 last
 prime


minister,
 Sebastian
 Leornneu.
 The


announcement
 comes
 amidst
 growing


pressure
 to
 prevent
 a
 political
 crisis


and
 pass
 a
 budget.
 And
 Bloomberg's


Caroline
 Conan
 has
 more
 from
 Paris.
 I


don't
 know if
 you
 know
 the
 movie


Groundhog
 Day,
 but
 it
 feels
 like
 this
 in


France
 at
 the
 moment,
 kind
 of
 leaving


the
 same
 day
 again
 and
 again.
 So,
 after


he
 resigned
 last
 Monday,
 Lukon
 was


appointed
 again
 on
 Friday
 night
 around


10
 p.m.
 French
 time,
 saying
 he
 accepted


the
 mission
 as
 of
 duty
 that
 his
 only


mission
 would
 be
 to
 pass
 a
 budget.
 And


Bloomer's
 Caroline
 Conan
 says
 it
 all


leaves
 Loru
 tasked
 with
 getting
 a
 budget


approved
 before
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 as


well
 as
 fending
 off
 a
 no
 confidence
 vote


later
 this
 week.


>> And
 back
 here
 in
 the
 US,
 Karen,
 a


noraster
 is
 churning
 up
 the
 East
 Coast,


prompting
 declarations
 of
 a
 state
 of


emergency
 in
 New
 Jersey
 and
 parts
 of
 New


York
 State.
 Let's
 get
 the
 very
 latest


from
 Bloomberg
 meteorologist
 Rob


Carolyn.
 Good
 morning,
 Rob.


>> Good
 morning,
 Nathan.
 We
 have
 an
 area
 of


low
 pressure
 this
 morning
 which
 is
 east


of
 Atlantic
 City.
 It's
 producing
 rain


from
 southern
 New
 England
 across
 the
 New


York
 City
 area
 down
 the
 coast
 all
 the


way
 to
 Washington.
 This
 storm
 system
 is


going
 to
 be
 moving
 very,
 very
 slowly.


So,
 it
 looks
 like
 more
 rain
 and
 wind


throughout
 the
 day
 from
 the
 Boston
 area


through
 New
 York
 City
 and
 on
 into


Washington.
 We'll
 see
 coastal
 areas


seeing
 winds
 at
 times
 over
 30
 mph.
 The


New
 York
 City
 areas
 under
 a
 wind


advisory
 through
 6
 p.m.
 Eastern
 Long


Island,
 it's
 a
 high
 wind
 warning
 through


2:00
 p.m.
 this
 afternoon.


>> Well,
 Rob,
 when
 do
 you
 expect
 all
 this


to
 end
 then?
 Well,
 it
 looks
 like
 the


rain
 will
 come
 to
 an
 end
 as
 showers


tonight,
 Nathan,
 in
 the
 district
 and


also
 in
 the
 New
 York
 City
 area.
 But
 rain


is
 likely
 to
 linger
 across
 Boston
 right


on
 in
 through
 Tuesday
 evening.
 I'm
 Rob


Carolyn,
 Bloomberg
 Radio.


>> All right,
 Rob,
 thank
 you.
 Well,
 we
 turn


back
 to
 the
 markets
 now
 where
 earnings


are
 front
 and
 center
 this
 week.
 We
 get
 a


preview
 with
 Bloomberg's
 Charlie
 P.


>> Big
 banks
 lead
 off,
 but
 we'll
 also
 hear


from
 United
 Airlines,
 CSX,
 and
 Johnson


and
 Johnson.
 The
 reports
 come
 amid


heightened
 trade
 tensions
 and
 questions


about
 a
 bubble
 in
 AI
 shares.
 Cam
 Dawson


is
 chief
 investment
 strategist
 at
 New


Edge
 Wealth.


>> The
 big
 question
 is,
 will
 we
 see
 the


same
 kind
 of
 big
 beats
 and
 raises
 that


we
 saw
 in
 the
 second
 quarter,
 which


certainly
 propelled
 stocks
 much
 higher


over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 summer.


Financials
 very
 much
 so
 the
 big
 story


this
 week
 with
 the
 likes
 of
 JP
 Morgan


Chase,
 Cityroup,
 Wells

 Bank
 of


New

 Bank
 of
 America,

 Charlie
 Pellet,

>> Thank
 you,
 Charlie.
 Economists
 are


marking
 up
 their
 estimates
 for
 US


economic
 growth
 this
 year
 and
 next.
 We


get
 the
 details
 on
 that
 from
 Bloomberg's


John
 Tucker.
 John,
 good
 morning.


>> And
 good
 morning,
 Nathan.
 Yeah,
 this
 is


the
 survey
 from
 the
 National
 Association


for
 Business
 Economics.
 They
 see


inflation
 adjusted
 GDP
 rising
 1.8%
 this


year.
 That's
 up
 half
 a
 percent
 from
 the


forecast
 made
 in
 June.
 The
 survey


respondents
 expect
 similar
 growth
 next


year.
 But
 the
 economists
 also
 see
 job


growth
 slowing
 to
 an
 average
 of
 only


60,000
 this
 year.
 The
 job
 growth
 has


slowed
 marketkedly
 in
 recent
 months
 and


that's
 a
 trend
 that
 prompted
 the
 Fed
 to


lower
 interest
 rates
 in
 September.
 The


NAB
 sees
 the
 Fed
 cutting
 rates
 once
 more


this
 year
 before
 reducing
 borrowing


costs
 by
 3/4
 of
 a
 point
 next
 year.
 in


New
 York.
 I'm
 John
 Tucker,
 Bloomberg


Radio.


>> Time
 now
 for
 a
 look
 at
 some
 of the
 other


stories
 making
 news
 in
 New
 York
 and


around
 the
 world.
 And
 for
 that,
 we're


joined
 by
 Bloomberg's
 Michael
 Bar.


Michael,
 good
 morning.


>> Good
 morning,
 Karen.
 President
 Trump


says
 he
 is
 looking
 into
 giving
 Ukraine


more
 weapons
 after
 a
 recent
 conversation


with
 President
 Vimir
 Zalinski.
 The


president
 spoke
 to
 reporters
 on
 board


Air
 Force
 One
 as
 he
 was
 traveling
 to


Israel.
 We
 talked
 about
 the
 weapons
 they


need.
 What
 kind
 of
 weapons?
 They
 need


patriots
 very
 badly.
 They'd
 like
 to
 have


tomahawks.
 That's
 a
 step
 up.
 They'd
 like


to
 have
 tomahawks.
 We
 talked
 about
 that.


>> President
 Trump
 added
 that
 he
 might
 tell


Russia
 the
 US
 could
 send
 the
 missiles
 if


the
 conflict
 isn't
 resolved.
 Several


people
 were
 killed
 and
 injured
 when


gunfire
 erupted
 early
 Sunday
 morning
 in


a
 crowded
 bar
 in
 St.
 Helena,
 South


Carolina.
 At
 least
 four
 people
 were


pronounced
 dead
 at
 the
 scene.
 The
 owner


of
 the
 bar,
 Willie
 Terrell,
 was
 wiping


away
 tears.


>> I'm
 thankful
 thankful
 uh
 for
 everybody


who
 who
 walked
 away.
 You
 know,
 I'm


thankful
 for
 everybody
 who
 who's
 alive,


who
 is
 safe.


>> Uh
 officials
 say
 hundreds
 of
 people
 were


inside
 at
 the
 time
 of
 the
 shooting.
 The


search
 for
 the
 cause
 of
 a
 deadly
 blast


at
 an
 explosives
 factory
 in
 Tennessee


continues.
 At
 least
 16
 people
 died
 when


the
 plant
 exploded
 Friday.
 The
 factory


near
 Nenelli
 made
 supplies
 and


explosives
 for
 the
 military.
 Families
 of


the
 victims
 and
 neighbors
 tried
 to


comfort
 each
 other
 during
 church


services
 Sunday.
 This
 man
 was
 at
 a


church
 service.


>> It's
 going
 to
 take
 time.
 Uh
 and
 it's


going
 to
 take
 all
 of
 us
 banding


together.
 Um
 but
 my
 I
 know
 with
 this


church
 family
 here
 and
 the
 other
 church


families
 around
 uh
 we
 we'll
 come


together.
 We'll
 we'll
 and
 we'll
 help


each
 other
 through
 it.
 To
 identify
 the


victims,
 authorities
 have
 had
 to
 rely
 on


DNA
 technology,
 taking
 DNA
 samples
 from


family
 members.
 And
 then
 they're


comparing
 that
 to
 DNA
 samples
 found
 at


the
 scene.

 from

 This
 is
 Bloomberg


Daybreak.


>> Good
 morning.
 I'm
 Nathan
 Hager.
 A
 great


and
 beautiful
 day,
 a
 new
 beginning.
 That


was
 the
 message
 from
 President
 Trump
 as


he
 arrived
 in
 Israel
 to
 celebrate
 the


ceasefire
 in
 Gaza,
 which
 he
 says
 he
 is


confident
 will
 hold.


>> Everybody
 is
 happy,
 whether
 it's
 Jewish


or
 Muslim
 or
 the
 Arab
 countries.
 Every


country
 is
 dancing
 in
 the
 streets
 and


it's
 a
 point
 in
 time
 I
 don't
 think
 you'd


ever
 see
 it
 again.


>> That
 was
 President
 Trump
 aboard
 Air


Force
 One
 on
 his
 way
 to
 Israel
 where
 he


is
 now
 due
 to
 address
 the
 Knesset.


Joining
 us
 this
 morning
 from
 Tel
 Aviv
 is


Bloomberg
 News
 Israel
 Bureau
 Chief
 Ethan


Bronner.
 And
 Ethan,
 as
 we
 await
 those


comments
 from
 President
 Trump,
 get
 us
 up


to
 speed
 on
 where
 we
 are
 in
 the


ceasefire,
 in
 the
 implementation.
 What


is
 the
 latest?
 Good
 morning.


>> Morning,
 Nathan.
 So,
 yes,
 the
 ceasefire


has
 been
 holding
 for
 several
 days.
 Uh
 20


Israeli
 hostages,
 the
 all
 of
 those
 who


were
 alive
 still
 are
 are
 out
 of
 the


captivity.
 Uh
 and
 uh
 the
 seven
 that
 have


already
 arrived
 in
 Israel,
 the
 13
 others


are
 on
 their
 way.
 Uh
 look,
 I
 think


healthier
 than
 many
 had
 feared.
 They're


on
 their
 feet.
 They're
 speaking.
 Uh
 and


Israel
 is
 beginning
 the
 process
 of
 uh


freeing
 some
 2,000
 just
 under
 2,000


Palestinian
 prisoners.
 At
 the
 same
 time,


uh
 President
 Trump
 is
 here.
 He's
 about


to
 address
 the
 parliament,
 the
 Knesset


in
 Jerusalem.
 He's
 just
 met
 with
 Prime


Minister
 Netanyahu.
 And
 the
 announcement


is
 now
 that
 in
 addition
 to
 all
 these


western
 and
 Arab
 countries
 and
 President


Trump
 going
 to
 Egypt
 that
 in
 fact
 prime


minister
 Netanyao
 is
 also
 going
 to
 go
 to


that
 ceremony.
 It
 was
 not
 originally


planned
 and
 is
 that
 there's
 also
 going


to
 be
 a
 Palestinian
 leader
 there
 Mahmud


Abbas.
 So
 what's
 going
 to
 come
 of
 this?


We
 shall
 have
 to
 see.


>> While
 we
 wait
 to
 see,
 what
 are
 you


watching
 for
 in
 terms
 of
 whether
 this


ceasefire
 continues
 to
 hold?


Well,
 the
 first
 thing
 to
 know
 is
 that


the
 goal
 of
 Israel
 and
 in
 theory
 in


theory
 both
 of
 the
 United
 States
 and
 all


of
 those
 who
 declared
 who
 signed
 on
 to


the
 so-called
 New
 York
 declaration
 at


the
 UN
 General
 Assembly
 is
 to
 remove


Hamas
 from
 power
 in
 Gaza.
 But
 within


minutes
 of
 the
 ceasefire
 beginning
 in


Gaza,
 uh
 Hamas
 operatives
 well
 armed


with
 Kalashnikovs
 uh
 took
 over
 the


streets
 uh
 of
 Gaza
 City
 and
 of
 much
 of


Gaza.
 And
 so
 and
 they
 are
 also
 now
 in


the
 process
 of
 clashing
 with
 some
 of
 the


clans
 that
 had
 said
 they
 were
 opposed
 to


Hamas.
 So
 it
 feels
 like
 the
 ability
 to


remove
 Hamas
 from
 power
 is
 not
 going
 to


be
 simple
 and
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 major


issue
 going
 forward.


>> On
 his
 way
 to
 Israel
 aboard
 Air
 Force


One,
 we
 heard
 President
 Trump
 say
 the


war
 is
 over.
 What
 will
 you
 be
 watching


for
 in
 terms
 of
 whether
 we
 get
 to
 that


point
 where
 we
 can
 actually
 say
 this
 is


more
 than
 just
 an
 open-ended
 ceasefire?


Look,
 I
 think
 that
 the
 either
 they're


going
 to
 have
 to
 adjust
 their
 goals
 of


of
 what
 this
 what
 the
 war
 end
 means.


That
 is
 to
 say,
 leave
 Hamas
 in
 some


position
 uh
 relating
 to
 the
 Palestinian


Authority
 or
 some
 multinational
 thing.


We
 don't
 know.
 But
 from
 Israel's


perspective,
 until
 now,
 this
 has
 not


been
 acceptable.
 Now,
 will
 it
 be


possible
 that
 Israel
 will
 be
 told
 just


hold
 off
 for
 a
 while
 while
 we


internationalize
 this
 and
 we're
 going
 to


rebuild
 the
 Gaza
 Strip
 and
 so
 on?


Possibly.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 one
 of the


reasons
 Prime
 Minister
 Nanau
 did
 not


want
 to
 go
 to
 Egypt
 is
 he
 did
 not
 want


to
 take
 part
 in
 this
 kind
 of
 ceremony.


He's
 always
 opposed
 internationalizing


the
 conflict.
 Uh
 but
 now
 that
 is


changing
 with
 perhaps
 the
 help
 of


President
 Trump.
 Maybe
 he's
 going
 to


maybe
 Israel
 is
 going
 to
 change
 its


mind.
 I
 don't
 know.
 The
 goal
 of
 course


for
 Israel
 and
 the
 United
 States
 is
 to


expand
 Israel's
 relations
 with
 its
 Arab


neighbors
 to
 include
 one
 day
 Saudi


Arabia.
 So
 all
 of
 those
 things
 are
 being


balanced
 against
 what's
 going
 to
 happen


in
 Gaza.
 And
 there's
 just
 so
 many


unknowns,
 Nathan,
 it's
 impossible
 for
 me


to
 tell
 you
 where
 we're
 headed.
