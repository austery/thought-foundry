Hi
 everybody.
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangian,
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth


Fund
 and
 today
 I'm
 thrilled
 to
 have


Brian
 Moyahan
 with
 us.
 Brian
 is
 the


chairman
 and
 CEO
 of
 Bank
 of
 America,
 one


of
 the
 world's
 largest
 financial


institutions
 and
 we
 own
 1
 and
 a
 half%
 of


this
 great
 company.
 Brian
 has
 led
 the


bank
 for
 15
 years,
 steering
 it
 through


the
 aftermath
 of
 the
 financial
 crisis


and
 transformed
 it
 into
 a
 digital


powerhouse.
 So
 Brian,
 wonderful
 to
 have


you
 here.
 It's
 great
 to
 be
 here
 and
 uh


thank
 you
 for
 your
 support
 to
 our


company
 and
 uh
 look
 forward
 to
 a
 great


session
 with
 you
 today.


>> Wonderful.
 Brian,
 you
 sit
 on
 the
 top
 of


uh
 one
 of
 the
 world's
 largest
 banks.


What's
 happening
 in
 the
 world?
 Well,
 I


think
 there's
 a
 little
 bit
 of


bifurcation
 between
 what's
 happening
 in


you
 know
 various
 segments
 of
 the
 world


but
 you
 can
 add
 it
 all
 up
 to
 the
 world


but
 I
 think
 largely
 what's
 being
 driven


now
 is
 the
 United
 States
 change
 in
 this


policy
 towards
 uh
 from
 an
 economic
 basis


leave
 aside
 a
 geopolitical
 basis
 but
 an


economic
 basis
 a
 major
 change
 going
 on


is
 that
 US
 has
 changed
 to
 uh
 with


respect
 to
 four
 policies
 trade
 tariff


type
 policies
 immigration
 policies


this
 is
 more
 domestic
 in
 the
 US
 but
 uh


the
 taxation


budget
 policy
 um
 and
 then
 deregulation


and
 you're
 seeing
 that
 play
 out
 in
 the


US
 and
 obviously
 as
 the
 world's
 largest


economy
 and
 the
 biggest
 trading
 partner


with
 most
 countries
 you're
 seeing
 that


impact
 around
 the
 world
 as
 we
 go
 through


that
 uh
 change
 in
 in
 the
 set
 of
 policies


with
 the
 new
 administ
 new
 Trump


administration.


>> So
 when
 you
 um
 when
 you
 uh
 try
 to
 get
 a


feel
 for
 where
 the
 world
 is
 moving
 what


are
 the
 indicators
 you
 are
 looking
 at?


So
 when
 you
 look
 around
 the
 world
 you


look
 at
 a
 lot
 of
 indicators
 but
 again


bring
 our
 our
 additional
 perspective
 on


the
 US.
 We
 have
 a
 great
 research
 team


which
 your
 firm
 and
 others
 benefit
 by.


That's
 a
 major
 investment
 a
 half
 billion


dollars
 a
 year
 annual
 investment
 in


research
 and
 and
 they
 have
 the
 world


growing
 a
 little
 bit
 less
 than
 3%
 for


the
 next
 uh
 for
 for
 this
 year.
 uh
 they


have
 the
 world
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 slowing


down
 a
 little
 bit
 uh
 based
 on
 all
 the


discussions
 uh
 we
 could
 have
 about
 trade


and
 tariff
 policy
 but
 when
 you
 look
 at


the
 US
 what
 we
 look
 at
 is
 not
 only
 what


that
 research
 team
 tells
 us
 which
 the
 US


will
 grow
 at
 1%
 fourth
 quarter
 of
 25


versus
 24
 to
 give
 you
 a
 sense
 annualized


you
 know
 what
 they
 give
 us
 that
 kind
 of


projection
 no
 recession
 Fed's
 not
 going


to
 cut
 rates
 then
 we
 look
 at
 our
 actual


customer
 data
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at
 our


customer
 data
 we
 have
 great
 insight
 in


the
 American
 consumer
 or
 70
 million


American
 households
 we
 do
 business
 with


we
 have
 great
 insight
 as
 largest
 small


business
 lender
 and
 middle
 market
 lender


in
 the
 US
 and
 those
 basically
 are


telling
 you
 uh
 interesting
 things
 that's


we
 look
 at
 then
 as
 broader
 indicators
 I


look
 at
 uh
 and
 we
 can
 go
 into
 what


they're
 telling
 us
 but
 in
 broader


indicators
 I
 also
 look
 in
 the
 US


importantly
 about
 new
 claims
 for


unemployment
 continuing
 claims
 for


unemployment
 because
 frankly
 that's
 a


leading
 indicator
 of
 what
 businesses
 are


really
 doing
 versus
 what
 they're
 saying


>> have
 you
 any
 private
 kind
 of
 secret


indicators


that
 you
 are
 that
 you
 are
 particularly


keen
 on
 that
 nobody
 else
 is
 really


looking
 at?


>> Well,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 American


consumer,
 the
 the
 uh
 discussion
 of


public
 domain
 was
 as
 consumer
 confidence


factors,
 you
 know,
 went
 down
 after
 a


liberation
 day,
 April
 2nd,
 and
 went
 back


up
 all
 the
 back
 and
 forth.
 What
 we
 did


saw
 was
 no
 break
 in
 no
 change
 in


activity.
 So,
 how
 what
 are
 we
 talking


about?
 the
 the
 Bank
 of
 America


consumers,
 70
 million
 of
 them,
 will
 send


out
 of
 their
 accounts
 about
 four
 and a


half
 trillion
 dollars
 this
 year
 into
 the


economy.
 Year
 to
 date,
 it's
 almost
 two


trillion
 because
 we're
 almost
 halfway


through
 the
 year.
 Um,
 if
 you
 look
 at


that,
 it's
 up
 about
 4
 and
 a
 half
 to
 5%


of
 the
 first
 part
 of
 25
 versus
 the
 p


first
 part
 of
 24.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the


month
 of
 June,
 four
 four
 and
 a
 half%.


When
 you
 look
 at
 that
 amount
 of
 money


going
 the
 economy,
 that
 means
 the


American
 consumer
 is
 participating


heavily.
 When
 you
 look
 at
 their
 their


balances
 and
 their
 accounts,
 stable
 to


growing,
 bouncing
 around,
 not
 you
 know


the
 core
 consumer
 kind
 of
 stable
 in
 the


higherend
 consumer
 money
 went
 into
 the


money
 market
 funds
 and
 other
 instruments


are
 earning
 interest,
 but
 the
 amount
 of


cash
 they
 have
 is
 actually
 at
 record


highs.
 And
 so
 they're
 in
 pretty
 good


shape.
 Unemployment's
 4.2%
 or
 whatever.


You
 know,
 the
 prospects
 for
 being


unemployed
 are
 relatively
 low.
 So
 you


put
 that
 aside
 and
 then
 you
 have
 to


balance
 that
 against
 what
 consumers
 are


saying
 they're
 feeling
 which
 is
 negative


due
 to
 all
 the
 change
 and
 all
 the


activity
 going
 on
 meaning
 what's
 that


mean
 that
 means
 you
 know
 the
 tariff
 war


that
 means
 immigration
 that
 means


they're
 reading
 that
 the
 economy
 is


slowing
 down
 and
 so
 what
 we
 see
 is
 US


consumers
 doing
 pretty
 well
 we
 look
 at


small
 mediumsiz
 businesses


>> Brian
 are
 you
 surprised
 that
 the


consumer
 is
 doing
 so
 well
 given
 given


the
 insert
 day


>> no
 not
 actually
 it
 it
 and
 it
 comes
 down


to
 Nicola
 the
 the
 thing
 people
 miss
 is


that
 the
 unemployment
 employment
 level


is
 4.1
 in
 the
 US
 which
 is
 100
 basis


points
 below
 full
 employment
 number
 one


and
 number
 two
 wage
 growth
 is
 actually


exceeding
 inflation
 in
 the
 aggregate


across
 a
 period
 of
 time
 now
 it
 es
 and


flows
 inflation
 came
 first
 and
 wage


growth
 cut
 up
 to
 it
 and
 now
 they're


running
 more
 in
 sync
 and
 then
 the


remember
 the
 US
 consumer
 is
 a


beneficiary
 of
 America's
 oil


independence
 and
 you
 and
 that
 allows
 us


to
 have
 a
 more
 balanced
 uh
 view
 when
 uh


oil
 oil
 prices
 move
 around
 but
 as
 oil


prices
 came
 down.
 That's
 a
 big
 benefit


to
 the
 American
 consumer
 because
 that


that
 just
 gives
 them
 more
 money
 to
 spend


on
 something
 else.
 So,
 I'm
 not
 surprised


by
 it.
 Uh
 consumer
 uh
 credit
 is
 very


strong.
 I'm
 not
 surprised
 by
 it
 at
 all.


I
 can
 understand
 why
 the
 people
 are


surprised
 by
 it.
 And
 that's
 because


they're
 reading
 survey
 data
 and
 that's


what
 a
 consumer
 is
 on
 the
 couch.
 That's


what
 they're
 telling
 you
 how
 they
 feel.


It's
 I
 always
 say
 look
 at
 what
 they're


doing,
 not
 what
 they
 say
 they're


feeling.


>> Why
 are
 they
 doing
 things
 differently


than
 what
 they
 feel?


>> Because
 they
 have
 money
 and
 they're


employed
 and
 and
 you
 know
 they're
 pretty


good
 at
 spending
 in
 America.
 And
 so
 that


doesn't
 mean
 that
 won't
 stop.
 It
 just


means
 that
 you
 know
 earlier
 this
 year


when
 everybody
 said
 American
 consumer


was
 out
 of
 you
 know
 was
 was
 being
 broken


by
 all
 this
 stuff
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago


when
 American
 consumer
 was
 supposedly


being
 broken
 by
 all
 this
 stuff.
 It
 never


happened.
 They
 just
 kept
 spending
 and


spending
 and
 spending.
 They
 were
 the


stimulus
 payments
 that
 came
 through
 in


2021.
 People
 thought
 they
 were
 going
 to


spend
 those
 down.
 They
 really
 didn't.


The
 balancing
 accounts
 kept
 going.
 Uh
 uh


basically
 came
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 and


then
 started
 growing
 again.
 And
 so
 it


all
 comes
 down
 to
 that,
 you
 know,
 the


American
 economy
 is
 in
 okay
 shape.
 It's


slowing
 down.
 And
 this
 is
 the
 trick.
 The


trick
 will
 be
 balancing
 the
 impact
 of


all
 this
 uncertainty
 around
 the
 business


community,
 which
 gets
 hit
 by
 higher


rates
 faster,
 especially
 small


medium-sized
 businesses.
 And
 also
 is


confused
 about
 what
 the
 rules
 of
 the


game
 are
 that
 they
 need
 straightening


out
 tax
 policy
 and
 uh
 you
 know,
 trade


policy
 and
 and
 immigration
 for
 those
 in


certain
 industries.
 They
 need
 those


workers.
 And
 if
 that
 doesn't
 clear
 up,


then
 I
 could
 see
 people
 starting
 to


actually
 really
 adjust
 their
 cost
 basis


and
 that
 would
 affect
 the
 American


consumer
 because
 they'd
 be
 wor
 more


worried
 about
 not
 having
 a
 job.


>> Are
 people
 with
 one
 political


affiliation
 spending
 more
 than
 the


people
 with
 the
 other
 political


affiliation?
 I
 mean,
 are
 they
 feeling


better
 about
 life?
 It


>> we
 don't
 really
 see
 that's
 a
 little
 hard


for
 us
 to
 tell
 in
 our
 our
 spending


because
 we
 don't
 have
 that
 data
 for
 our


people.
 But
 if
 you
 look
 at
 it
 more


broadly
 in
 the
 surveys,
 you
 see
 that


people
 who
 uh
 in
 the
 Michigan
 survey
 you


can
 see
 in
 other
 surveys,
 you
 can
 see


it's
 split
 by
 party
 affiliation
 in
 terms


of
 their
 views
 of
 the
 future
 path
 of


inflation,
 the
 future
 path
 the
 economy,


but
 it
 averages
 all
 out
 because


America's
 a
 50/50
 split
 by
 and
 large.
 It


kind
 of
 average
 each
 other
 out.
 So


people
 I
 think
 overplay
 that
 because


they're
 trying
 to
 make
 a
 political


point.


>> But
 I
 always
 say
 don't
 don't
 look
 at


what
 people
 say
 they're
 going
 to
 do.


Look
 at
 what
 they're
 actually
 going
 to


do.
 Whether
 it's
 a
 person
 on
 credit,
 are


they
 going
 to
 pay
 it?
 It's
 not
 whether


they
 say
 they're
 going
 to
 pay,
 it's
 whe


and
 a
 person
 on
 spending,
 it's
 not


whether
 say
 they're
 going
 to
 spend
 or


not,
 it's
 what
 they're
 doing.
 And
 I


think
 the
 consumers
 adjusted
 their


spending
 around,
 but
 it's
 pretty
 good.


Now,
 if
 you
 go
 to
 small
 medium-sized


businesses,
 this
 is
 where
 the
 Fed's
 rate


structure
 really,
 really
 pinches
 and


people
 are
 writing
 more
 about
 that,
 but


it
 took
 a
 while
 for
 people
 to
 understand


that
 because
 large
 companies
 go
 to
 the


markets
 and
 are
 not
 affected.
 a
 flat


rate
 curve
 allows
 them
 to
 go
 out
 the


curve
 and
 actually
 secure
 longerterm


funds.
 The
 problem
 is
 a
 a
 person
 who
 is


running
 a
 a
 $50
 million$100
 million,


$200
 million
 revenue
 company,
 they're


borrowing
 on
 lines
 of
 credit
 and
 that


rate
 base
 rate
 went
 from,
 you
 know,
 25


basis
 points
 to
 50
 basis
 points
 up
 to


five
 and
 now
 down
 to
 fourish.
 That


change
 is
 a
 huge
 change
 in
 the
 rate
 paid


and
 that
 slowed
 the
 the
 businesses
 down


in
 terms
 of
 making
 decisions
 and
 you
 can


see
 it
 that
 they
 aren't
 using
 the
 lines


of
 credit
 at
 the
 level
 they
 were
 pre-


pandemic
 and
 sort
 of
 why
 not
 the
 economy


is
 growing
 well
 enough
 you
 know
 the


opportunity
 for
 demand
 uh
 fulfillment's


out
 there
 and
 it's
 because
 they're


worried
 they
 aren't
 buying
 the
 piece
 of


equipment
 they're
 not
 making
 the
 change


and
 that's
 what
 we
 site
 when
 we
 talk
 to


the
 administration
 in
 the
 United
 States


and
 say
 you
 really
 need
 to
 settle
 this


in
 so
 that
 group
 of
 small
 mediumsiz


businesses
 will
 get
 more
 aggressive
 and


as
 the
 Fed
 brings
 rate
 structure
 down


they'll
 feel
 better.


>> Is
 it
 the
 uh
 the
 level
 of
 rates
 which
 is


the
 main
 concern
 for
 for
 the
 business


clients
 or
 is
 it
 other
 types
 of


uncertainty
 you
 think?


>> Well,
 if
 our
 survey
 of
 of
 small
 business


customers
 over
 the
 last
 year
 has
 shown


different
 elements.
 First
 it
 was
 rates


and
 inflation
 because
 that
 was


preoccupied
 but
 um
 and
 then
 it
 shifted


back
 to
 workers.
 Why
 I
 say
 back
 to


workers
 it
 was
 at
 that
 during
 the
 great


resignation
 a
 couple
 years
 ago
 in
 United


States
 and
 what
 they're
 saying
 is
 the


inability
 to
 get
 enough
 employees
 that


can
 do
 the
 jobs
 that
 they
 have
 that
 is


being
 exacerbated
 uh
 by
 a
 lot
 of


discussion
 you
 hear
 from
 them
 about
 the


impact
 of
 inflation
 and
 if
 you're
 in


construction
 and
 all
 its
 related
 parts


you're
 a
 cement
 company
 you're
 a


delivery
 company
 you're
 construction


actually
 building
 the
 buildings
 the


impact
 of
 the
 immigration
 policy
 is


causing
 people
 not
 to
 show
 up
 if
 you're


in
 the
 hotel
 and
 leisure
 farming,
 it's


impacting
 you
 and
 and
 so
 I
 think
 in
 the


broad-based
 employees,
 that's
 why
 you're


hearing
 the
 administration
 saying
 we
 got


to
 sort
 this
 out
 to
 make
 sure
 people


know
 they're
 going to
 have
 the
 workers


to
 be
 successful
 and
 and
 being


agriculture
 and
 travel
 and
 entertainment


and
 other
 types
 of
 industries
 because


it's
 not
 that
 the
 activity
 is
 affecting


a
 lot
 of
 them.
 It's
 the
 worry
 about
 the


activity
 that's
 going to
 affect
 them


that
 causes
 the
 workers
 not
 to
 come.
 So


they
 went
 from
 being
 all
 about


inflation,
 all
 about
 rates
 to
 wait,
 I


can't
 get
 the
 workers
 again
 and
 can
 I


get
 those
 workers.
 So
 everything


everything's
 on
 their
 mind,
 but


uncertainty
 about
 some
 of
 these
 topics


is
 critical
 to
 them.


>> What
 about
 supply
 chain
 disruptions?
 Is


that
 a
 is
 that
 a
 main
 topic
 for
 your


clients?


>> Yeah,
 it
 it
 is.
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 fit
 that
 more


in
 a
 tariff
 and
 look
 at
 the
 end
 of the


day,
 we
 all
 learned
 something
 during
 co


which
 is
 the
 the
 world's
 supply
 chains


became
 extremely
 inefficient.
 The


problem
 was
 they
 weren't
 extremely


resilient.
 And
 so
 as
 these
 tariffs
 go


on,
 people
 are
 seeing
 sort
 of
 I've
 got


to
 be
 able
 to
 move
 my
 supply
 chain
 to


places
 where
 uh
 maybe
 more
 favored
 as
 a


trading
 partner
 to
 America
 if
 I'm


bringing
 my
 goods
 into
 America.
 The
 real


short-term
 thing
 is
 if
 I'm
 getting
 my


goods
 from
 certain
 countries,
 you
 know,


if
 I
 have
 the
 same
 good
 manufactured
 in


a
 country
 with
 tariffs
 of
 10
 15%
 versus


30
 40%.
 You
 know,
 and
 I'm
 going
 to


supply
 to
 the
 same
 store
 to
 sell,
 guess


what?
 who
 who's
 going
 to
 get
 sold
 the


lower
 price
 unless
 I
 just
 eat
 the


tariffs.
 So
 that
 that
 you
 know
 going


back
 to
 liberation
 day
 that's
 what
 sent


the
 shock
 to
 the
 system
 the
 market
 went


way
 down
 the
 reaction
 to
 it
 as
 it
 became


clear
 that
 they
 were
 going
 to
 get
 deals


done
 and
 try
 to
 mitigate
 the
 overall


size
 of
 the
 tariff
 that
 happened
 but
 the


companies
 have
 two
 two
 things
 they're


thinking
 about
 supply
 chain
 one
 is
 what


is
 the
 tariff
 architecture
 trade


architecture
 non-tariff
 barrier


architecture
 and
 then
 secondly
 you
 know


what
 is
 the
 plain
 facts
 about
 the


ability
 to
 have
 a
 supply
 chain
 that
 if


something
 happens
 in
 a
 narrow
 in
 a
 pl
 a


very
 specific
 place
 it
 doesn't
 affect


them


>> that
 that
 we
 learned
 in
 co
 you
 know


surgical
 masks
 uh
 certain
 types
 of


medical
 equipment
 certain
 types
 of


formulararies
 leave
 aside
 the
 high-tech


and
 ships
 and
 chips
 and
 everything
 this


is
 just
 basic
 stuff
 you
 couldn't
 get
 it


out
 of
 the
 country
 uh
 because
 of
 a


particular
 area
 was
 going
 through
 a


stress
 that's
 not
 resiliency
 and
 I
 think


a
 lot
 of
 supply
 chain
 managers
 said
 whoa


whoa
 whoa
 you're
 telling
 me
 I
 can't
 get


this
 at
 any
 price
 and
 they're
 saying
 yes


they're
 saying
 well
 fix
 that
 and
 that


means
 you
 know
 the
 Vietnams
 and
 others


Mexicos
 and
 others
 will
 benefit
 by
 the


supply
 chain
 sort
 of
 spreading
 out.


>> Moving
 topic
 a
 bit,
 many
 banks
 are


closing
 their
 branches.
 You
 are
 still


seem
 to
 be
 a
 great
 believer
 in
 your


branches.
 You
 got
 close
 to
 4,000
 of


them.
 Um
 why
 why
 do
 you
 have
 a
 different


view
 on
 branches
 than
 many
 other
 banks?


>> Well,
 we
 believe
 in
 high
 touch
 high-tech


and
 we
 follow
 the
 customer
 and
 the


customer
 you
 shows
 us
 they
 like
 to
 do


all
 the
 above,
 right?
 And
 so
 whether


they
 like
 the
 phone
 channel,
 they
 like


the
 branch
 channel,
 they
 like
 the
 uh


mobile
 channel
 and
 online
 channel,
 they


like
 all
 the
 different
 ways
 to
 interface


the
 company.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 uh


what's
 happened
 over
 time,
 we've
 gone


from
 6,000
 branches
 to
 37
 3,800
 branches


today.
 We've
 added
 branches
 in
 new


cities.
 Well,
 we
 still
 have
 gone
 down.


We've
 gone
 from
 100,000
 people
 working


in
 our
 consumer
 business
 to
 about
 60,000


today.
 That's
 a
 massive
 reduction
 due
 to


the
 digitization,
 customer
 behavior


change.
 But
 between
 the
 next
 today
 and


tomorrow,
 you
 know,
 24-h
 hour
 period,
 a


half,
 million,
 350,000
 people
 will
 come


down
 into
 our
 branches.


>> And
 who
 and
 who
 are
 these
 people?
 Are


they
 mainly
 older
 people
 or


>> it
 all
 everybody
 says
 it's
 a
 you
 would


say
 it's
 older
 cohorts
 and
 stuff.
 It's


just
 not
 true.
 It's
 it's
 a
 whole
 bunch


of
 people.
 It's
 small
 it's
 entrepreneurs


who
 want
 to
 open
 their
 accounts.
 It's


people
 coming
 in
 from
 investment
 advice.


Largely
 what's
 big
 transformation
 is
 a


lot
 of
 the
 routine
 activity.
 The


strategy
 of
 branches
 uh
 starting
 30


years
 ago
 was
 to
 basically
 take


variability
 out
 to
 make
 it
 you
 know
 a


machine
 operation
 and
 make
 it
 very
 very


processoriented
 and
 and
 so
 we
 did
 that


that
 made
 them
 efficient
 say
 from
 30


years
 ago
 to
 20
 years
 ago
 to
 then
 we


said
 wait
 a
 second
 a
 lot
 of
 these


transactions
 can
 actually
 be
 done
 by
 the


customer
 themselves
 uh
 depositing
 a


check
 um
 and
 you
 know
 that
 can
 be
 done


through
 a
 mobile
 device
 it
 can
 be
 done


through
 the
 ATM
 and
 suddenly
 We're
 able


to
 move
 activity
 out.
 What
 that
 then


left
 behind
 is
 what
 Nikolai
 is
 what


really
 is
 important
 which
 is
 in
 those


60,000
 people
 today.
 We
 have
 probably


twice
 the
 relationship
 capacity
 we
 did


back
 then
 because
 people
 tend
 to
 come
 in


for
 more
 difficult
 issues.
 My
 mother


died.
 I'm
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to


get
 the
 power
 of
 attorney
 so
 I
 can
 work


with
 accounts.
 I
 need
 a
 mortgage
 loan.


Uh
 I'm
 I'm
 just
 got
 my
 first
 bonus
 and


I'm
 a
 younger
 person.
 I
 want
 to
 uh


figure
 out
 how
 to
 invest
 it.
 And
 you


know
 we
 have
 2500
 uh
 FAS
 we
 call
 them


financial
 associates
 in
 the
 branches


that
 will
 help
 them
 start
 with
 mail


ledge.
 Uh
 the
 so
 the
 the
 complexity
 of


the
 branches
 have
 changed
 to
 be
 much


more
 relationship
 oriented.
 That's
 why


the
 visit
 time
 is
 you
 know
 much
 more


scheduleable
 and
 understandable
 as


opposed
 to
 people
 coming
 in
 and
 doing


routine
 transactions.


That
 principle
 applies
 to
 all
 cohorts
 of


age.


>> You
 know
 there's
 no
 no
 difference.
 If
 I


if
 I'm
 my
 mother
 died
 and
 I'm
 60
 or
 my


mother
 died
 and
 I'm
 30,
 the
 issues
 I
 got


to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 handle
 her


accounts,
 you
 know,
 so
 there
 there's
 not


as
 much
 distinction
 on
 those
 types
 of


issues.


>> Brian,
 you've
 been
 pretty
 vocal
 uh
 when


it
 comes
 to
 regulation
 of
 banks.
 Um
 and


we
 love
 people
 who
 are
 vocal
 about
 uh


you
 know
 what
 they
 really
 believe
 in.
 So


tell
 us
 what
 do
 you
 uh
 what
 is
 your
 take


on
 bank
 regulations
 today?


>> If
 you
 look
 at
 it
 today,
 the
 it's
 a


classic
 case
 of
 the
 pendum
 swung
 past


the
 point.
 um
 and
 you
 and
 also
 became


sort
 of
 unreconcilable
 with
 each
 other.


So
 if
 you
 go
 back
 to
 the
 financial


crisis,
 DoddFrank
 in
 the
 United
 States,


Basel
 3
 implementation
 on
 a
 global


basis,
 all
 these
 things
 were
 meant
 to


basically
 look
 at
 the
 core
 things
 that


they
 thought
 were
 inadequate
 uh
 after


the
 financial
 crisis.
 One
 of
 the
 core


things
 that
 was
 inadequate
 that
 people


forget
 about
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 that


caused
 the
 stress
 and
 financial
 crisis


were
 not
 in
 the
 banks
 in
 system
 were
 not


regulated.
 First
 you
 brought
 the


companies
 in
 then
 it
 was
 capital


liquidity
 range
 of
 activities
 of
 those


companies
 get
 them
 out
 of
 private
 equity


and
 more
 principal
 activities
 and
 more


into
 supporting
 clients
 like
 yourselves


let
 you
 guys
 make
 the
 investments
 let


the
 private
 equity
 firms
 make
 the


investments
 don't
 compete
 against
 them


so
 range
 of
 activities
 uh
 and
 then
 you


and
 it
 went
 down
 the
 road
 the
 models
 and


uh
 how
 to
 how
 to
 build
 models
 and
 things


like
 that
 but
 what
 happened
 in
 that
 time


frame
 especially
 in
 the
 United
 States
 is


the
 the
 the
 way
 the
 rules
 kept
 changing


is
 going
 back
 when
 we
 thought
 that
 the


capital
 ratios
 in
 the
 banks
 of
 7
 8%


would
 be
 adequate
 under
 the
 first
 after


DoddFrank
 you
 know
 and
 that
 was
 still


you
 know
 25
 30%
 increase
 probably
 from


where
 people
 were
 to
 there
 and
 people


said
 that
 would
 be
 enough
 we
 now
 went


from
 7
 8%'s
 adequate
 to
 10
 11%'s


adequate
 and
 the
 risk
 in
 the
 industry
 is


actually
 quite
 frankly
 probably
 come


down
 on
 a
 relative
 basis
 during
 that


time


>> so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 all
 the
 regulations


where
 where
 are
 the
 worst


overregulations


>> well
 first
 of
 all
 In
 201
 you
 know
 181
 19


the
 capital
 industry
 was
 sufficient
 and


it's
 gone
 up
 by
 25%
 and
 now
 they
 say


it's
 sufficient.
 So
 I
 think
 what
 they


have
 to
 do
 is
 get
 the
 capital
 rules
 set.


They
 have
 to
 get
 Basel
 3
 implementing


United
 States
 but
 on
 a
 fair
 basis


because
 we
 use
 a
 different
 standard.
 Uh


we
 got
 capital
 rules
 set.
 We
 got
 to
 get


rid
 of
 some
 of
 the
 overlapping
 liquidity


rules
 which
 you've
 seen
 with
 this


supplemental
 leverage
 ratio
 change.
 And


we've
 got
 to
 get
 clearer
 about
 our


ability
 to
 engage
 in
 more
 modern


commerce
 that's
 around
 you
 the
 cyber


stable
 coins
 and
 things
 like
 that


because
 it
 wasn't
 clear
 before.
 And
 then


you
 got
 to
 let
 banks
 go
 out
 and
 this


isn't
 appropriate
 for
 Bank
 America


because
 we're
 not
 allowed.
 Let
 the


mergers
 take
 place
 faster
 because


there's
 4,000
 banks
 in
 United
 States
 and


there'll
 be
 changes
 in
 that
 system
 and


they
 got
 to
 not
 try
 to
 overregulate
 that


change
 for
 purpose
 have
 nothing
 to
 do


with
 the
 merger.
 So
 I
 think
 capital


liquidity
 merger
 rules
 and
 then
 frankly


the
 consumer
 regulation
 stuff
 just
 got


much
 more
 penalty
 oriented
 much
 more


fine
 oriented
 much
 more
 beyond
 what


consumers
 want
 and
 got
 away
 from


consumer
 choice
 that's
 already
 swung


back
 too
 and
 there's
 high
 hopes
 this


administration
 we
 get
 it
 back
 to
 balance


>> anything
 which
 is
 not
 regulated
 enough


>> like
 private
 like
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 private


credit
 uh
 alternative
 providers
 of


credit
 and
 so
 on
 where
 where
 do
 you
 see


that


>> so
 the
 principle
 is
 getting
 lost
 a


little
 bit
 Nikolai
 in
 the
 last
 chunk
 of


time
 here
 is
 the
 their
 banking


regulators
 being
 sort
 of
 the
 what
 their


charter
 is
 across
 the
 world
 always
 only


look
 at
 the
 banking
 system
 and
 then
 try


to
 regulate
 the
 outside
 the
 banking


system
 through
 the
 banking
 system
 as


opposed
 to
 saying
 wait
 if
 you
 make
 loans


or
 take
 deposits
 you're
 a
 bank
 whether


you're
 a
 a
 stable
 coin
 uh
 provider
 or


whether
 you're
 a
 private
 capital
 lender


you
 know
 you
 have
 to
 be
 regulated
 a


mortgage
 lender
 etc
 so
 the
 consumer


bureau
 in
 the
 United
 States
 was
 meant
 to


expand
 by
 activity,
 not
 by
 charter,
 as


they
 call
 it.
 Activity,
 meaning
 I
 make
 a


mortgage
 loan
 charter.
 I'm
 a
 bank
 versus


non-bank.
 So,
 it
 went
 to
 do
 that.
 That


was
 a
 good
 thing.
 Unfortunately,
 it
 got


it
 bollocked
 up
 in
 different
 ways
 and


and
 got
 away
 from
 it
 core
 charter.
 But


that's
 a
 good
 thing.
 That's
 not


happening
 in
 the
 commercial
 space.
 In


other
 words,
 there's
 lots
 of
 entrance
 in


the
 system
 who
 are
 not
 regulated
 in
 the


same
 way
 as
 other
 entrance.
 And
 what


that
 means
 is
 you
 start
 to
 get
 into
 um


you
 know,
 regulatory
 arbitrage,


so-called,
 right?
 if
 I
 can
 do
 this


outside
 the
 system
 and
 that's
 where
 the


banking
 system
 if
 you
 look
 in
 the
 United


States
 where
 it's
 simpler
 to
 describe


because
 of
 depth
 of
 capital
 markets
 half


of
 every
 asset
 class
 being
 commercial


loans
 consumer
 loans
 or
 more
 is
 outside


our
 banking
 system
 and
 so
 you
 know
 and


you're
 saying
 is
 that
 a
 good
 thing
 or


bad
 thing
 you
 could
 say
 it's
 a
 good


thing
 because
 it
 spreads
 a
 risk
 but
 it's


not
 a
 good
 thing
 if
 the
 activity
 goes
 on


in
 a
 different
 regulation
 so
 if
 we're


allowed
 to
 do
 leverage
 of
 X
 for
 a


company
 and
 that
 looks
 like
 good
 credit


why
 can
 somebody
 just
 put
 it
 in
 a


different
 place
 and
 do
 more
 leverage.


They
 may
 be
 right,
 but
 then
 why
 can't
 we


do
 it?
 You
 know,
 it's
 you
 shouldn't
 have


regulatory
 uh
 leakage
 cause
 a
 problem.


That
 that
 piece
 got
 lost
 in
 the
 banking


regulation
 principles
 that
 DoddFrank
 put


came
 in
 and
 around
 the
 world,
 you
 know,


all
 these
 institutions
 came
 into
 the


banking
 environment
 were
 regulated
 by


the
 ECB,
 by
 the
 P,
 etc.,
 etc.
 Now


they're
 leaking
 back
 out
 and
 that's
 the


question.


>> You
 are
 in
 many
 different
 countries.
 Um


outside
 of
 the
 US,
 which
 countries
 are


you
 the
 most
 excited
 about?
 Well,
 we


continue
 to
 be
 excited
 about
 um
 what's


going
 on
 in
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 in
 terms


of
 inward
 development.
 Now,
 in
 in
 the


days
 where
 people
 went
 and
 said,
 "Give


it,
 you're
 making
 money,
 give
 us
 your


money
 to
 go
 manage,
 you
 know,
 it's
 a


different
 world
 and
 different


possibilities
 for
 banking."
 We've
 been


in,
 you
 know,
 Dubai
 for
 60
 years.
 So,


it's
 not
 like
 a
 new
 new
 thing
 to
 us.


But,
 you
 know,
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 Saudi


Arabia,
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 UAE
 and


and
 helping
 those
 companies
 grow
 and


prosper.
 That's
 kind
 of
 very


interesting.
 Asia
 will
 always
 be


interesting.
 It
 es
 and
 flows
 where
 it's


interesting.
 We
 have
 a
 great
 franchise


in
 in
 Australia
 which
 continues
 to
 grow.


We
 we
 got
 a
 good
 business
 in
 Japan
 which


has
 a
 new
 found
 of
 uh
 shareholder


discipline
 and
 stuff
 which
 ought to
 be


good
 for
 investment
 banking


capabilities.
 And
 then
 you
 know
 and
 then


Europe
 we
 we
 believe
 that
 we
 have
 lots


of
 market
 share
 to
 gain.
 It's
 not
 Europe


grows
 at
 1%
 but
 we
 think
 with
 our


products
 and
 services
 our
 capabilities


whether
 it's
 in
 the
 corporate
 investment


banking
 space
 or
 in
 the
 market
 space
 we


just
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 room
 to
 grow
 in
 the


UK
 and
 Europe
 I
 put
 together
 in
 that


case
 in
 all
 of
 European
 sort
 of
 broader


set
 of
 countries
 and
 so
 we
 feel
 there's


growth
 opportunities
 everywhere
 and
 in


fact
 our
 international
 business
 you
 know


just
 to
 give
 you
 a
 sense
 of
 how
 big
 it's


how
 much
 our
 company's
 changed
 because


our
 name
 is
 Bank
 of
 America
 everybody


thinks
 of
 America
 our
 international


business
 we
 went
 from
 approximately
 uh


20
 billion
 outstanding
 loans
 15
 years


ago
 about
 130
 150
 billion
 today.
 So
 it's


grown
 dramatically
 and
 it's
 keyed
 us
 to


take
 those
 multinational
 clients
 across


the
 world
 and
 help
 them
 navigate
 all
 the


economies.
 India
 is
 another
 good


country.
 We've
 been
 there
 60
 plus
 years.


You
 know
 we've
 been
 on
 these
 countries
 a


long
 time
 and
 we
 keep
 investing
 and


they're
 all
 good
 opportunities


especially
 when
 you
 have
 a
 world
 that's


very
 disagated
 market
 share
 like
 it
 is


in
 banking.
 M
 you
 reminded
 us
 uh
 that


your
 name
 is
 Bank
 of
 America
 and
 of


course
 this
 is
 a
 bit
 of a
 sensitive


question
 but
 you
 know
 uh
 in
 some
 parts


of
 the
 world
 the
 view
 of
 America
 has


changed
 a
 bit
 lately.
 Do
 you
 think
 uh
 is


Bank
 of
 America
 a
 good
 name
 to
 have?


>> It
 it
 is
 it's
 it
 stands
 it's
 a
 a
 great


brand
 and
 we
 we
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 research
 on


it.
 Um
 and
 so
 the
 great
 positives
 it


comes
 with
 u
 obviously
 in
 a
 world
 where


people
 want
 to
 take
 a
 position
 about


America
 say
 about
 America
 you're
 bank
 of


America
 uh
 people
 confuse
 us
 with
 the


Fed
 we're
 not
 the
 Fed
 because
 in
 certain


countries
 the
 bank
 of
 X
 is
 the
 central


bank
 we're
 not
 the
 central
 bank
 and
 so


you
 get
 some
 interesting
 fun
 uh
 uh


happenings
 around
 that
 where
 people


write
 the
 letter
 to
 me
 acting
 like
 I'm


setting
 interest
 rates
 or
 something


which
 I'm
 not.
 Um
 but
 you
 know
 it's
 it's


a
 great
 franchise,
 a
 great
 brand
 and
 we


have
 Merill
 for
 the
 uh
 consu
 the


financial
 advisory
 business
 in
 the
 US


because
 it's
 distinctive
 but
 outside
 the


US
 we
 basically
 operate
 as
 Bank
 of


America
 except
 where
 it's
 not
 legal
 to


do
 that
 because
 we
 do
 a
 securities


business
 and
 then
 we
 operate
 Bank


America
 Maril
 Lynch
 or
 some
 other


configuration
 but
 it's
 a
 great
 brand
 and


you
 know
 we
 take
 its
 pluses
 and
 minuses


and
 you
 know
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day
 you


know
 we've
 been
 around
 this
 country
 uh


since
 uh
 George
 Washington
 was
 president


in
 the
 oldest
 parts
 of
 our
 bank.
 So
 it's


been
 a
 good
 ride.


>> Moving
 on
 to
 technology.
 How
 will
 AI


transform
 the
 bank?


>> It's
 already
 started.
 Um


so
 it's
 going
 to
 transform
 the
 bank


around
 a
 couple
 dimensions
 are
 different


and
 it's
 just
 started
 in
 earnest.
 Um


first
 it
 enables
 you
 to
 have
 replace
 uh


human
 interaction
 with
 to
 human


interaction.
 Second,
 it
 replaces
 your
 it


helps
 you
 analyze
 what
 we
 call
 text
 to


text.
 In
 other
 words,
 big
 amounts
 of


information.
 How
 do
 you
 pull
 them


together
 and
 have
 them
 come
 out
 the


other
 side
 so
 somebody
 then
 can
 take


that
 and
 utilize
 it
 differently?
 It
 also


can
 help
 you
 with
 testing
 and
 and
 and


checking
 things.
 We
 file,
 you
 know,


literally
 millions
 and
 millions
 of


reports
 a
 day
 and
 it
 helps
 you
 not
 only


prepare
 those,
 but
 more
 importantly
 to


test
 those
 to
 make
 sure
 they're
 accurate


and
 and
 and
 helps
 you
 find
 out
 ways
 to


improve
 them.
 So,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 back


and
 it
 helps
 us
 in
 computer
 coding,


we're
 already
 using
 it.
 18,000
 plus


programmers
 already
 use
 it
 and
 and


stuff.
 So
 let
 me
 let
 me
 give
 a
 very


concrete
 straightforward
 example.
 So


this
 product
 this
 technique
 we
 call


Erica.
 So
 Erica
 is
 the
 way
 a
 consumer


can
 have
 a
 virtual
 assistant
 at
 Bank
 of


America.
 You're
 hearing
 a
 lot
 about


agent
 agent
 bots
 and
 all
 that
 stuff.


We've
 had
 this
 now
 for
 5,
 seven,
 eight


years.
 We
 started
 about
 10
 12
 years
 ago


and
 what
 we
 had
 them
 develop
 is
 we


looked
 at
 the
 search
 technology
 and
 it


just
 wasn't
 going
 to
 work
 in
 financial


services.
 So
 we
 had
 them
 develop
 a
 new


natural
 language
 processing
 predictive


model
 which
 today
 we
 call
 a
 small
 lang


you
 know
 small
 language
 model.
 Back
 then


nobody
 would
 have
 called
 it
 that
 because


it
 was
 a
 different
 world.
 We
 had
 them


build
 that
 for
 us
 and
 then
 we
 used
 it


and
 trained
 on
 our
 own
 data
 and
 it
 can


answer
 questions
 and
 now
 20
 million
 Bank


America
 customers
 use
 Erica
 each
 quarter


about
 200
 million
 times
 to
 ask
 questions


that
 it
 can
 answer.
 Now,
 Erica
 has
 a
 lot


of
 room
 to
 go
 in
 refinements
 and


improvements
 and
 and
 doing
 it,
 but
 we


know
 it
 works.
 And
 those
 200
 million


interactions
 would
 have
 been
 a
 phone


call,
 a
 tech,
 a
 text
 or
 an
 email
 or


walking
 into
 a
 branch.
 So,
 200
 million


times
 a
 quarter
 we're
 moving.
 We're


heavy
 digitalized
 already.
 We
 have
 50


billion
 consumer
 interactions
 a
 year.


So,
 it's
 massive
 amount
 of
 activity.


It's
 heavy
 digitalized,
 but
 the
 room
 to


go
 to
 digitalize
 it
 more
 with
 AI
 is


different
 with
 with
 the
 machine
 learning


and
 and
 other
 types
 of
 models
 we
 had.


And
 Erica
 shows
 us
 that
 bridge


>> and
 when
 you
 benchmark
 your
 usage
 of
 AI


and
 technology
 against
 other
 banks,
 what


do
 you
 see?


>> You
 know,
 I
 I
 this
 is
 where
 you
 get
 into


the
 question
 of
 what
 people
 say
 they're


doing,
 what
 we're
 doing.
 We
 we
 see
 Erica


out
 there
 working.
 We
 don't
 see
 any


product
 that's
 actually
 see
 we
 see
 the


in
 certain
 products
 are
 just
 emerging


that
 can
 do
 that.
 um
 we've
 seen
 what


we've
 done
 in
 coding
 and
 other
 other


people
 are
 talking
 about
 it.
 We
 have


18,000
 people
 literally
 doing
 this


today.
 So
 we
 we
 feel
 we
 are
 a
 company
 of


applied
 technology
 in
 just
 massive
 uh


massive
 amounts.
 So
 we
 spend
 about
 four


and
 a
 half
 billion
 dollars
 a
 year
 on


technology
 initiatives
 we
 call
 it
 which


is
 new
 new
 code
 and
 new
 work.
 Um
 we


apply
 that
 relentlessly.
 We're
 one
 of


the
 largest
 patent
 holders
 for
 all
 kinds


of
 technology,
 including
 AI
 a
 technology


applications
 in
 the
 US.
 And
 so
 our
 view


is
 we're
 we're
 state-of-the-art
 and


beyond.
 But
 what
 we
 aren't
 doing
 is


announcing
 things
 which
 don't
 stick
 to


the
 ribs.
 We're
 very
 much
 a
 company
 that


says
 we'll
 tell
 people
 after
 it's


already
 operating
 and
 drive
 it
 through


the
 system.
 And
 so
 that
 so
 with
 coding,


a
 lot
 of
 people
 talked
 about
 I'm
 you


know
 doing
 this.
 What
 we
 say
 is
 let's


get
 people
 going.
 And
 we're
 saving
 about


there's
 21
 steps
 in
 a
 project
 to
 go
 from


business
 initiation
 to
 endpoint.
 Five
 or


six
 of
 them
 are
 capable
 of
 being


enhanced
 by
 artificial
 intelligence.


We're
 using
 it
 18,000
 people.
 We're


saving
 about
 30%
 of
 those
 five
 steps


which
 gets
 us
 about
 10%
 overall,
 you


know,
 and
 so
 we're
 much
 more
 applied
 uh


driver
 of
 it
 and
 nobody
 has
 anything


like
 Erica
 and
 size
 and
 scale.
 Nobody


has
 the
 automated
 underwriting
 we
 do,


you
 know,
 things
 like
 that.
 But
 the
 real


question
 is
 how
 do
 you
 keep
 driving
 this


to
 new
 places?
 And
 so
 our
 teammates
 in


investment
 bank
 are
 preparing
 pitch


books.
 We
 just
 started
 implemented
 that.


They
 all
 still
 have
 people
 in
 front
 of


them
 to
 make
 sure
 they're
 right
 and
 how


they
 work,
 but
 it
 gives
 them
 a
 leg
 up.


And
 so
 we're
 applying
 this
 uh
 daily
 uh


uh
 uh
 uh
 uh
 customer
 interactions
 in
 the


markets
 business
 are
 all
 driven
 by


artificial
 intelligence
 off
 the
 base
 of


our
 research.
 Not
 grabbing
 stuff
 from


all
 over
 everywhere
 and
 throwing


together
 and
 making
 mistakes.
 It
 takes


our
 research
 and
 organiz
 and
 delivers
 it


out
 in
 a
 more
 comprehensive
 fashion
 to


our
 clients
 and
 so
 the
 maestro
 every
 day


shoots
 that
 out
 to
 everybody.
 So
 we


believe
 in
 applying
 this
 technology.


>> So
 when
 you
 have
 um
 deployed
 uh
 all
 your


user
 cases
 and
 all
 everybody
 else
 have


deployed
 all
 their
 user
 cases
 and
 you


have
 you
 know
 the
 humanoid


helping
 us
 on
 the
 on
 the
 blue
 collar


side.
 What
 what
 is
 society
 going
 to
 look


like
 10
 15
 years
 from
 now?
 This
 is
 this


is
 one
 of
 the
 great
 questions
 out
 there


but
 but
 you
 can
 talk
 from
 experience.
 So


our
 company
 uh
 you
 this
 is
 my
 16th
 year


having
 the
 honor
 of
 running
 the
 place


and
 we've
 driven
 a
 lot
 of
 change.
 It


went
 in
 2010
 we
 had
 285,000
 people.


Today
 we
 have
 212,000
 people.
 So
 that's


all
 the
 c
 the
 numbers
 of
 customers
 are


larger.
 The
 numbers
 of
 interactions
 are


through
 the
 roof.
 The
 numbers
 of
 you


size
 of
 the
 loan
 book
 is
 is
 is
 bigger.


Their
 size
 of
 deposit
 book
 is
 you
 almost


threefold
 bigger.
 You
 numbers
 of


consumer
 transactions
 blah
 blah
 blah


blah
 blah
 trading
 transactions,
 quotes,


everything.
 Hugely


bigger
 company
 but


you
 know
 30%
 less
 people.
 That
 was
 all


by
 applying
 technology.
 What
 this
 gives


you
 is
 a
 chance
 to
 go
 to
 places
 you


couldn't
 go
 before.
 And
 so
 what
 we
 did


is
 we
 took
 the
 company
 and
 took
 you
 know


compensation
 levels
 AI
 susceptibility


you
 know
 the
 one
 axis
 compensation


levels
 the
 other
 axis
 AI
 susceptibility


and
 then
 dots
 for
 how
 big
 the
 um
 the
 the


numbers
 of
 people
 doing
 those
 activities


are
 and
 what
 you're
 looking
 for
 is
 dots


that
 are
 susceptible
 that
 are
 highly


paid
 that
 are
 big
 volumes
 of
 people
 and


that's
 what
 you're
 trying
 to
 go
 after.


So
 that's
 different
 than
 the
 automation


we
 went
 through
 15
 years
 ago.
 it
 was


more
 uh
 processing
 teammates
 and
 things


like
 that.
 We
 only
 have
 25,000


processing
 teammates
 in
 the
 company


maybe
 30,000
 out
 of
 the
 200
 some


thousand.
 So
 as
 the
 work
 has
 already


shifted
 this
 allows
 you
 to
 go
 to


different
 places
 to
 our
 our
 risk


teammates,
 our
 finance
 teammates,
 our
 HR


teammates,
 the
 HR
 team
 uses
 uh
 uh
 some


techniques
 in
 terms
 of
 resumes
 and


things
 like
 that.
 That's
 the
 difference


here.
 And
 so
 what's
 the
 societal
 impact


of
 that?
 I'll
 give
 you
 glass
 half
 full


half
 empty.
 Um
 in
 1969
 America
 employed


80,000
 80
 million
 people
 worked
 in


America.
 In
 1960s
 the
 advent
 of
 of


computers
 the
 advent
 of
 technology
 the


idea
 that
 all
 the
 jobs
 were
 going
 to
 go


to
 Japan
 Inc.
 at
 that
 point
 it
 was


before
 China
 emerged
 the
 idea
 that
 you


know
 the
 US
 was
 going
 to
 be
 more


abundant
 employment.
 Today
 we
 have
 160


million
 people
 working
 and
 so
 something


happened
 as
 all
 that
 technology
 I
 think


from
 the
 late
 60s
 now
 came
 on
 stream


that
 we
 are
 able
 to
 employ
 twice
 as
 many


people
 in
 this
 country
 and
 so
 I
 think


simply
 put
 the
 world
 has
 a
 way
 of


working
 in
 the
 way
 around
 us
 this
 goes


to
 different
 places
 I
 can
 understand
 why


people
 are
 a
 little
 concerned
 but
 on
 the


other
 hand
 you
 know
 at
 a
 firm
 like
 yours


which
 is
 a
 brain
 power
 firm
 and
 that's


what
 you
 do
 it'll
 help
 people
 be
 more


effective
 it'll
 make
 and
 over
 time
 you


may
 be
 able
 to
 trim
 your
 aggregate


headcount
 but
 It
 doesn't
 mean
 you're


gonna
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 long
 time
 and


maybe,
 you
 know,
 someday
 people
 can


fantasize
 about
 it
 before
 we
 have
 no


people
 left.


>> Brian,
 you
 became
 CEO
 in
 2010
 after
 the


financial
 crisis.
 What's
 the
 toughest


decision
 you
 made
 during
 your
 tenure
 in


the
 bank?


>> Well,
 the
 toughest
 decisions
 all
 ran


around
 how
 how
 we
 got
 through
 the


aftermath
 of
 financial
 crisis
 and
 how
 we


had
 to
 be
 so
 resolute
 on
 resolving


issues.
 So
 we
 had
 a
 quarter
 where
 you
 we


settled
 lawsuits,
 the
 $20
 billion


lawsuit,
 etc.
 You
 know,
 those
 were
 tough


decisions.


It
 wasn't
 necessarily
 the
 financial


decision
 that
 was
 tough
 enough,
 but
 it


was
 the
 people
 implications
 of
 deciding


to
 take
 a
 completely
 different
 position


in
 the
 mortgage
 business.
 Um,
 and
 you


from
 company
 was
 doing
 one
 in
 five


mortgages,
 we
 had
 to
 go
 down
 to
 where
 we


got
 to
 5%
 share
 because
 we
 what
 we
 were


doing
 was
 not
 directly
 with
 consumers.


Those
 were
 hard
 decisions
 because
 they


affected
 people's
 lives
 and
 our
 ability


and
 and
 had
 to
 retrain
 our
 whole
 brain


power
 in
 the
 company.
 Um
 that
 was
 a


tough
 all
 the
 decisions
 that
 are


toughest
 are
 about
 people
 you
 know
 and


disrupting
 other
 people's
 lives.
 So


downsizing
 people,
 changing
 people
 and


that's
 why
 we
 frankly
 have
 worked
 very


hard
 to
 do
 headcount
 management
 to
 avoid


layoffs
 and
 we've
 been
 pretty
 good
 at
 it


for
 the
 last
 1015
 years.
 In
 the
 early


days,
 we
 had
 to
 do
 some
 layoffs.
 And
 to


me,
 that's
 the
 toughest
 decision
 because


you're
 basically
 walking
 into
 somebody


who
 was
 a
 great
 worker,
 worked
 the
 you


work
 for
 the
 company,
 and
 say,
 you
 know


what,
 we
 just
 can't
 use
 you
 anymore.
 And


that's
 going
 to
 our
 AI
 conversations
 why


we're
 managing
 headcount
 so
 carefully


and
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 make


sure
 that
 we
 aren't
 overstaffing
 and


then
 having
 to
 take
 people
 out.


>> Do
 you
 tell
 anybody
 yourself
 or
 you
 is


that
 delegated
 to
 other
 people?


>> Oh,
 I
 I
 had
 to,
 you
 know,
 I
 never
 start


a
 process
 like
 this
 unless
 I'm
 willing


to
 change
 the
 people
 work
 for
 me,
 you


know.
 So
 actually
 it
 ironically
 it
 in


the
 first
 downsizing
 we
 did
 out
 as
 a


financial
 crisis
 I
 lost
 my
 job
 and
 and


it
 was
 before
 I
 CEO
 I
 I
 was
 running


integration
 and
 I
 decided
 that
 the
 pos


one
 of
 the
 positions
 they
 had
 to


eliminate
 was
 mine
 and
 and
 I
 was
 almost


out
 of
 the
 company
 and
 they
 offered
 me
 a


different
 job
 and
 I
 stayed.
 So
 I
 believe


resolutely
 that
 you
 have
 to
 start
 from


the
 top.
 This
 is
 not
 a
 bottoms
 up
 thing


and
 I
 think
 it
 I
 also
 believe
 resolutely


that
 management
 has
 to
 be
 careful
 on


staffing
 to
 ensure
 that
 they
 don't


disrupt
 the
 broad
 base
 of
 employees
 and


that
 this
 is
 coming
 from
 a
 guy
 for
 25
 30


years
 who
 spent
 his
 life
 doing
 M&A


merger
 integration
 you
 know
 the


relentless
 take
 out
 of
 cost
 as
 you
 went


to
 organic
 growth
 company
 you
 have
 to
 be


much
 more
 careful
 because
 there
 when


you're
 doing
 a
 merger
 company
 A
 company


B
 people
 know
 that
 there's
 going
 to
 be


changes


>> when
 you're
 organic
 growth
 company
 like


we
 are
 now
 people
 don't
 anticipate


there's
 going
 to
 be
 those
 kinds
 of


changes
 so
 you
 have
 to
 manage
 in


performance
 management
 etc
 so
 yes
 I
 had


to
 tell
 myself
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 would
 expect


not
 at
 all
 my
 direct
 reports
 cascade


through
 you
 know
 how
 to
 at
 those
 times


how
 to
 take
 uh
 take
 action
 I
 we


basically
 run
 the
 company
 so
 we
 don't


have
 to
 do
 that
 again


>> you
 mentioned
 you
 mentioned
 M&A
 and
 many


other
 banks
 have
 kind
 of
 pivoted
 into


wealth
 management
 fintech
 acquired


things
 now.
 Uh,
 Bank
 of
 America
 has


maintained
 a
 a
 a
 very
 steady
 course.
 Um,


why
 is
 that?


>> Well,
 there
 there's
 there's
 one
 I
 don't


want
 to
 go
 to
 jail
 because
 it's
 illegal


to
 acquire
 banks
 in
 the
 US
 if
 you're


above
 10%
 of
 deposit.
 Not
 it's
 not


criminally
 uh
 responsible.
 But,
 you


know,
 it's
 just
 against
 the
 law


honestly.
 And
 so,
 we
 cannot
 acquire


another
 bank
 with
 deposit
 unless
 that


bank
 fails.
 And


>> lots
 of
 other
 stuff.
 Lots
 of
 other
 stuff


you
 can
 buy,
 right?
 you
 know,
 wealth


management,
 whatever.


>> Then
 when
 you
 go
 to
 wealth
 management,


other
 stuff,
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 has
 deposits
 in


it,
 you
 know,
 and
 so
 and
 so
 we've
 been


careful
 about
 that.
 But
 let
 me
 step


back.
 In
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 we
 have


such
 an
 organic
 growth
 capability
 in


this
 company.
 So
 our
 highest
 market


shares
 are
 in
 the
 low,
 you
 know,
 10,
 13,


14%.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 room
 to
 grow
 and
 we


have
 the
 brand
 capability,


uh,
 the
 the
 teammate
 capability,
 the,


you
 know,
 the
 product
 capability,
 you


can
 just
 drive
 the
 organic
 growth.
 So


when
 people
 say
 we
 got
 out
 of
 the
 asset


management
 business
 because
 we
 thought


it
 was
 inconsistent
 with
 being
 the


biggest
 distribution
 house.
 We
 have
 $4.5


trillion
 dollars
 in
 wealth
 management


assets,
 you
 know,
 we
 take
 great


companies
 and
 manage
 money
 and
 and
 get


them
 into
 our
 investors.
 We
 didn't
 need


to
 make
 the
 product
 honestly.
 And
 so
 we


got
 out
 of
 we
 sold
 that.
 But
 that


doesn't
 mean
 we
 don't
 have
 a
 huge
 stake


in
 wealth
 management.
 You
 know,
 it's
 one


of the
 biggest
 in
 the
 in
 the
 business.


So
 that
 happens.
 So
 we
 we're
 always


trying
 to
 think
 through
 how
 do
 we
 our


basic
 principle
 is
 we
 have
 eight


customer
 se
 uh
 businesses
 we
 go
 after


the
 customers
 directly
 we
 don't
 do


indirect
 business
 so
 we
 try
 to
 really


focus
 on
 that
 and
 that
 led
 us
 to
 saying


our
 best
 thing
 was
 to
 be
 giving


financial
 advice
 to
 the
 customer
 whether


it's
 automatedly
 through
 me
 edge
 or


personally
 through
 uh
 the
 private
 bank


or
 mel
 rather
 than
 you
 know
 basically


it's
 a
 wholesaling
 uh
 uh
 asset


management
 product.
 So
 as
 we
 look


forward
 we
 bought
 uh
 we
 bought
 companies


and
 payments
 you
 know
 and
 payment


technology.
 So
 we
 bought
 companies
 in


medical
 payments
 in
 other
 areas
 and
 we


will
 continue
 to
 do
 that
 to
 add
 products


and
 capabilities
 in
 the
 payments
 area


that
 that's
 and
 we've
 also
 formed


companies.
 So
 Zel
 which
 was
 had
 a


predecessor
 was
 formed
 by
 the
 industry.


We
 formed
 countries
 companies
 to
 help


drive
 that
 we'll
 continue
 to
 do
 that.
 So


you
 know
 our
 our
 view
 is
 we're
 organic


growth
 company
 and
 we
 got
 to
 be
 focused


here
 and
 then
 if
 we
 see
 a
 market


opportunity
 like
 in
 the
 401k
 business
 we


invested
 you
 know
 100
 million
 our


business
 and
 drove
 it
 because
 with
 a
 you


know
 6570
 billion
 expense
 base
 an


incremental
 10020
 million
 rather
 than


doing
 an
 acquisition
 if
 you
 could
 even


find
 a
 company
 and
 figure
 out
 how
 to


reconfigure
 it
 you
 could
 just
 drive
 it


and
 drive
 it
 through
 the
 sales
 force.
 So


we
 we've
 learned
 a
 lesson
 about
 how
 fast


we
 can
 drive
 things
 in
 the
 world
 will


spend
 the
 money
 to
 support.
 How
 would


you
 how
 would
 you
 describe
 the
 corporate


culture
 in
 the
 mech
 the
 corporate


culture?
 Look,
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 it's
 it's


embedded
 in
 the
 the
 phrase
 the
 question


we
 asked.
 What
 would
 you
 like
 the
 power


to
 do?
 Our
 culture
 is
 to
 help
 serve
 our


clients
 to
 help
 them
 achieve
 their


financial
 goals
 u
 and
 do
 that
 and
 serve


all
 our
 constituenties,
 our
 clients,
 our


customers
 help
 them
 meet
 their
 goals.


Our
 teammates
 help
 each
 other
 meet
 their


goals.
 our
 shareholders,
 help
 them
 meet


their
 goals
 and
 our
 communities
 because


the
 end
 day
 we
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 our


communities
 are
 are
 are
 strong
 and


resilient
 because
 that
 that's
 the
 core


base
 of
 the
 economy
 of
 which
 we
 make
 our


money.


>> Do
 you
 think
 a
 bank
 is
 a
 bank?


I
 I
 mean
 is
 do
 you
 think
 the
 corporate


culture
 in
 your
 bank
 is
 very
 different


from
 other
 banks
 or
 or
 or
 is
 a
 banker
 a


banker?
 I
 I
 I
 think
 they're
 the
 products


and
 services
 are
 more
 commodity.
 The
 way


you
 deliver
 them
 is
 not.
 And
 so


delivering
 on
 a
 customer
 focused
 basis


make
 you
 know
 direct
 to
 the
 customer
 not


having
 those
 you
 know
 places
 that
 are


indirectly
 customer
 businesses
 etc.
 You


know
 that
 is
 different
 but
 and
 in
 our


products
 our
 brand
 and
 our
 capabilities


our
 talent
 are
 the
 the
 fact
 we're
 global


the
 fact
 we're
 nationwide
 those
 are
 all


very
 unique
 things.
 there's
 only
 a


couple
 of
 us
 can
 do
 what
 we
 do
 on
 a


global
 basis
 for
 corporates
 and
 and


investors
 around
 the
 world.
 There's
 only


you
 know
 a
 handful
 of
 companies.
 So


those
 are
 very
 unique.
 Um
 but
 you
 just


said
 a
 checking
 account
 is
 a
 checking


account
 but
 how
 you
 deliver
 that


checking
 account
 for
 on
 a
 customer


focused
 integrated
 rewards
 basis
 th
 that


takes
 a
 philosophical
 difference
 and


then
 how
 do
 you
 position
 yourself
 as
 and


our
 client
 our
 customers
 our
 teammates


how
 they
 desire
 to
 help
 the
 customers


put
 our
 brand
 at
 the
 best
 just
 keeps


going
 up
 and
 up
 and
 up
 in
 terms
 of


satisfaction
 in
 all
 our
 businesses
 that


that's
 a
 unique
 that
 focus
 I
 think
 is


unique.
 Okay.
 So,
 now
 we're
 coming
 into


one
 of
 your
 3,700
 branches.
 Okay.
 Yeah.


>> I'm
 52
 years
 old,
 got
 a
 checking


account.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 how
 how
 can
 I


feel
 that
 Bank
 of
 America
 is
 different


from
 other
 banks?


>> Well,
 I'll
 tell
 you
 a
 story.
 I
 I
 was


sitting
 next
 to
 somebody
 uh
 that
 I


didn't
 know
 and
 they
 turned
 to
 me
 they


and
 they
 said,
 you
 know,
 we
 went
 in
 with


three
 generations
 in
 my
 family.
 my


father,
 me,
 and
 and
 my
 son,
 and
 we
 all


had
 business,
 and
 the
 people
 did
 such
 a


great
 job.
 Her
 father,
 who
 had
 been
 a
 a


leader
 in
 the
 military,
 said
 they
 run
 a


pretty
 good
 unit
 on
 the
 way
 out
 the


door,
 you
 know,
 which
 meaning
 the


execution
 was
 strong.
 So,
 but
 all
 the


all
 the
 customers
 felt
 that
 way.
 She


said,
 "They
 took
 great
 care
 of
 my


father.
 They
 took
 great
 care
 of
 me.
 My


son
 was
 excited
 to
 open
 his
 first
 bank


account."
 That's
 what
 we
 want
 to
 instill


is
 that
 at
 the
 point
 of
 attack
 that


happens
 over
 and
 over
 and
 over
 again.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 my
 email
 is
 in
 the


public
 domain.
 If
 customer
 doesn't
 get


that
 experience,
 they
 don't
 they're
 not


feelful,
 right?
 Let
 me
 know.
 And
 so
 I


don't,
 you
 know,
 they
 can
 they
 can
 send


an
 email
 directly
 to
 me
 and
 to
 our
 other


teammates
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 house.
 So
 we


hear
 about,
 you
 know,
 anything
 goes
 bump


in
 a
 night
 and
 we
 try
 to
 figure
 out
 why


and
 re-engineer
 it.
 That's
 the
 process


side
 of
 running
 this
 huge
 enterprise.


You
 leave
 nothing
 to
 chance.
 But
 the


feeling
 side
 you
 want
 is
 that
 customer


came
 just
 unsolicited
 tell
 me
 to
 your


point.
 I
 walked
 in
 your
 branch
 and
 I
 got


this
 experience
 and
 that
 customer
 didn't


know
 me.
 Other
 customers
 who
 know
 me


will
 tell
 it
 but
 that
 customer
 I'd
 never


met
 in
 my
 life
 until
 I
 sat
 next
 to
 them


at
 a
 thing
 that
 was
 unrelated
 to
 bank.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 is
 the
 key
 to
 building


a
 high
 performance
 culture?


>> Look
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day
 you
 got
 to


get
 great
 people.
 You
 got
 to
 coach
 them


and
 and
 the
 number
 one
 thing
 is
 they
 got


to
 believe
 the
 company
 is
 in
 it
 for


them.


>> So
 they
 continue
 to
 seek
 development.


They
 continue
 to
 seek
 uh
 advice.
 They


continue
 to
 learn.
 They
 feel
 that
 the


culture
 not
 only
 will
 help
 them
 do
 the


day-to-day,
 you
 know,
 save,
 protect


their
 family,
 uh
 keep
 their
 family


healthy,
 that
 stuff.
 They
 really
 want
 to


know
 this
 company's
 going
 to
 help
 me
 do


something
 here
 I
 can't
 otherwise
 do.
 And


so
 in
 areas
 where
 we're
 recruiting


against
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 biggest
 best


firms
 in
 the
 world
 that
 you
 can
 describe


in
 technology
 or
 cyber
 security,
 the


people
 come
 here
 because
 they
 know
 they


can
 do
 special
 things,
 but
 they
 also


know
 that
 we're
 going to
 do
 it
 the
 right


way.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 the
 key


to
 getting
 that
 talent.
 You
 got
 to
 get


that
 talent
 and
 but
 you
 got
 to
 make
 sure


that
 talent
 thrives.
 And
 so
 we
 take
 an


employee
 survey
 and
 we
 just
 got
 back
 the


results
 and
 it's
 up
 a
 you
 continues
 to


increase
 and
 up
 a
 couple
 points
 since


last
 year.


>> But
 180,000
 people
 fill
 out
 that
 survey


>> and
 so
 it's
 not
 and
 we
 asked
 them
 what


do
 they
 think
 about
 the
 company
 and
 48


questions.
 I've
 been
 doing
 it
 for
 30


years.
 We
 can
 look
 at
 the
 nuances.
 But


you
 want
 them
 to
 say,
 I
 believe
 my


manager
 is
 going
 to
 make
 me
 better
 and
 I


believe
 I
 can
 do
 anything
 I
 can
 do
 with


this
 company
 and
 I
 can
 seize
 on
 that


opportunity.
 That's
 what
 gets
 that


culture
 going
 that
 you
 want
 because
 that


then
 means
 the
 best
 and
 brightest
 will


come
 stay
 and
 prosper.


>> Where
 do
 where
 do
 you
 personally
 seek


advice?


>> I
 look
 I
 get
 my
 advice
 from
 doing
 what
 I


suggest.
 I
 I
 read
 a
 lot
 from
 a
 lot
 of


sources
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 sources
 that
 I
 might


may
 or
 may
 not
 agree
 with.
 And
 then
 I


have,
 you
 know,
 I
 always
 am
 watching


what
 other
 companies
 do
 and
 what
 other


CEOs
 do
 and
 what
 other
 CEOs
 in
 the
 past


have
 done.
 And
 it's
 not
 like
 I
 go
 to
 X


and
 say,
 "What
 do
 you
 think?"
 It's
 more


you
 you
 get
 a
 paniply
 of
 X's
 and
 say,


you
 know,
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 how


they
 thought
 through
 these
 questions?
 So


I've
 had
 the
 luck
 of
 having
 great


mentors
 along
 the
 way.
 But
 every
 time
 I


sit
 in
 a
 session,
 I'm
 always
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 how
 you
 know
 some
 of
 my
 peers


analyze
 a
 problem
 that
 I
 may
 have
 not


have
 thought
 to
 what
 they're
 thinking


about
 or
 other
 companies
 what
 they're


thinking
 about
 or
 listen
 to
 clients.
 And


so
 it's
 just
 you
 got
 to
 be
 a
 learning


machine
 and
 and
 that's
 the
 the
 trick


about
 being
 a
 CEO
 is
 or
 anybody
 in
 our


society
 today
 is
 the
 information
 is


curated
 to
 you
 and
 you
 have
 to
 avoid


curation.
 You
 have
 to
 seek
 beyond
 that.


You
 have
 to
 try
 to
 find
 out
 different


things.
 And
 then
 in
 an
 industry
 where


you're
 the
 leading
 company,
 you
 one
 of


the
 leading
 companies,
 you
 have
 also


have
 to
 look
 outside
 our
 industry
 a
 lot


to
 what
 is
 important.
 So
 when
 we
 think


about
 our
 brand,
 you
 know,
 yes,
 in


financial
 services,
 etc.
 But
 what
 are


the
 best
 brands
 that
 ever
 existed
 and


why
 and
 what
 when
 did
 uh
 great
 brands


make
 mistakes,
 you
 know,
 that's
 where


you
 think
 about,
 you
 know,
 Jim
 Collins


and
 the
 great
 business
 writers
 and


mighty
 fall
 and
 all
 these
 different


things.
 You're
 always
 trying
 to
 figure


out
 from
 all
 that,
 you
 know,
 sort
 of


>> what
 are
 the
 best
 brands
 which
 ever


existed.


>> Oh,
 we
 look
 at
 them
 all.
 All
 the
 big


consumer
 brands,
 all
 the
 big


institutional
 brands,
 people
 have
 grown


market
 share
 organically
 across
 periods


of
 time.
 Uh,
 and
 we're
 studying
 them.


And
 I
 I
 won't
 name
 them
 because
 that's


not
 fair
 to
 them
 or
 to
 the
 ones
 I


wouldn't
 name,
 but
 you
 you'd
 have
 your


usual
 suspects.
 But,
 you
 know,
 we're


you're
 always
 in
 different
 business.
 So,


you
 can't
 just
 say
 they
 did
 this,
 we
 do


that.
 You
 have
 to
 sit
 there
 and
 say
 what


were
 the
 principles
 by
 which
 they
 did


this.
 What
 are
 the
 biggest
 reasons
 for


failure
 that
 you
 are
 trying
 to
 avoid?


>> I
 I
 think
 you
 a
 complacency
 u
 b
 you
 get


stuck
 in
 bureaucracy
 and
 progress
 a


large
 company.
 How
 do
 you
 break
 through


that?
 C
 you
 you
 don't
 get
 ahead
 or
 get


ahead
 of
 a
 trend.
 And
 this
 is
 where
 AI


is
 kind
 of
 interesting
 is
 you
 got
 to
 we


got
 to
 utilize
 this
 and
 drive
 it.
 But
 if


you
 get
 too
 far
 ahead,
 you
 can
 bet
 the


company
 in
 a
 way
 that
 may
 not
 work.
 And


so
 that's
 you
 know
 and
 those
 are
 the


source
 of
 failure.
 people
 get
 too
 far


ahead
 of
 a
 trend
 or
 don't
 keep
 up
 with
 a


trend
 and
 or
 don't
 keep
 the
 brand
 fresh


or
 don't
 think
 think
 they're
 doing
 well


when
 they're
 not
 doing
 well
 and
 are


willing
 to
 poke
 at
 and
 ask
 questions.
 So


while
 a
 CEO
 would
 you
 know
 always
 has
 to


be
 optimistic
 you
 know
 in
 the
 heat
 of


the
 night
 you
 have
 to
 be
 very
 sort
 of


what
 am
 I
 what
 are
 we
 doing
 wrong
 what


could
 we
 do
 better
 all
 the
 time
 but
 you


have
 to
 make
 sure
 you
 translate
 that


into
 action
 into
 process
 so
 it
 gets
 done


and
 that's
 that's
 tricky
 yes


>> how
 do
 you
 remain
 a
 learning
 machine


>> you
 just
 you
 get
 up
 early
 in
 the
 morning


and
 I
 just
 absorb
 you
 know
 just
 start


reading
 you
 know
 multiple
 papers


multiple
 news
 sources
 uh
 multiple


research
 papers
 um
 and
 you're
 just


listening
 out
 there,
 you
 know,
 you're


always
 listening
 and
 and
 trying
 to


learn.
 And
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 you
 know,
 we


talk
 about
 young
 kids
 today.
 You
 know,


one
 of
 the
 fears
 I
 have
 is
 the
 curation


of
 of
 uh
 of
 the
 way
 they
 get
 fed.
 The


way
 we
 all
 get
 fed,
 I
 shouldn't
 say
 it's


young
 people,
 it's
 everybody.
 The
 way
 we


all
 get
 fed
 through
 news
 feeds
 and
 the


algorithm
 and
 stuff
 narrows
 your
 scope


as
 opposed
 to
 improve
 your
 scope.
 But
 I


there's
 a
 there's
 a
 book
 written
 by
 a


fellow
 named
 Brian
 Graas,
 who's
 a
 great


movie
 producer,
 writer,
 etc.
 called
 it
 a


curious
 mind.
 I
 always
 recommend
 that
 to


the
 young
 kids
 because
 I
 say
 it
 talks


about
 his
 career.
 It's
 a
 fun
 story.
 He's


a
 wonderful
 human
 being
 and
 done


wonderful
 things.
 But
 he
 did
 it
 a
 lot
 by


just
 asking
 questions
 and
 learning
 a


lot.
 And
 you
 know,
 I
 always
 say
 to


people
 that's
 the
 way
 way
 to
 pattern


your
 life.
 I
 ran
 into
 that
 book,
 you


know,
 10
 years
 ago
 or
 so.
 But
 you
 know,


but
 you
 look
 at
 that
 story
 and
 that
 I


suggest
 your
 listeners
 read
 that
 book.


It's
 275
 pages.
 But
 it
 just
 keeps


reminding
 you
 that
 if
 you
 keep
 trying
 to


learn,
 you'll
 be
 a
 powerful
 engine.
 Um,


and
 but
 if
 you
 stop
 learning,
 you
 get


created.
 That's
 that's
 the
 problem.
 So
 I


I
 get
 information
 from
 lots
 of
 sources.


But
 the
 key
 is
 how
 do
 you
 keep
 making


sure
 that
 aperture
 stays
 open,
 doesn't


get
 closed
 because
 every
 time
 you
 look


at
 X,
 Y,
 and
 Z,
 it
 starts
 to
 shove
 into


that
 corner
 under
 the
 modern
 meth


techniques
 uh
 for
 information
 delivery.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 great
 place
 to


end
 because
 normally,
 guess
 what?
 We
 end


with
 uh
 you
 know
 advice
 to
 young
 people


and
 you
 you
 already
 given
 it
 seems
 like


you
 have
 to
 read
 that
 book
 to
 uh
 remain


a
 learning
 machine
 like
 you
 have
 and
 uh


it's
 for
 sure
 very
 impressive
 what
 you


have
 achieved.
 So
 big
 thanks
 for
 being


with
 us
 today.


>> Thank
 you
 and
 thank
 you
 for
 all
 all
 you


do
 and
 hopefully
 you
 enjoyed
 it
 and
 uh


look
 forward
 to
 talking
 to
 you
 again.


>> Absolutely.
 Thank
 you.
