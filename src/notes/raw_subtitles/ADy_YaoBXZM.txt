Leaders
 and
 citizens
 of
 Switzerland,


this
 is
 a
 message
 from
 Toronto,
 Canada.


I'm
 contacting
 you
 about
 your
 problem.


Yes,
 I'm
 talking
 about
 this.
 It's
 time


you
 up
 your
 game,
 Switzerland,
 because


let
 me
 tell
 you,
 Sweden's
 got
 some


beautiful
 PR
 department
 in
 the


government.
 His
 Excellency
 Jacqu
 Pedulu,


the
 ambassador
 of
 Switzerland
 to
 the


United
 States
 of
 America,
 did
 his
 best.


But
 that
 video's
 got
 half
 a
 million


views
 versus
 Sweden's.


So,
 I
 would
 like
 to
 help
 you
 out.
 No,


you
 didn't
 ask
 for
 this,
 but
 people
 from


your
 country
 watch
 my
 channel,
 and
 I


thought
 it's
 time
 to
 pay
 you
 back.
 So,


today
 is
 about
 you,
 Switzerland,
 and


specifically
 about
 your
 tech
 because


YouTube
 doesn't
 talk
 enough
 about
 your


tech.
 And
 let
 me
 tell
 you,
 of
 all


places,
 you
 deserve
 some
 love.
 I'm
 open


to
 feedback,
 but
 I
 believe
 that
 we
 need


to
 end
 this
 trend
 of
 you
 only
 being


talked
 in
 the
 context
 of
 cost
 of
 living


and
 billionaires
 as
 soon
 as
 possible


because
 you've
 got
 tech,
 Switzerland.


Please
 watch
 this
 excessively
 data
 heavy


video
 on
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 your
 tech


space
 and
 subscribe.
 Thank
 you.
 When
 I


think
 about
 Swiss
 tech,
 I
 think
 niche


and
 exclusive,
 but
 before
 this
 research,


I
 couldn't
 really
 pin
 down
 exactly
 what


makes
 Switzerland
 unique.
 You
 hear
 UK


fintech
 and
 cyber,
 Sweden,
 unicorns.


Germany,
 industrial
 tech,
 but


Switzerland.
 This
 was
 by
 far
 the
 most


difficult
 episode
 to
 work
 with
 because


Switzerland
 isn't
 widely
 discussed
 on


popular
 tech
 platforms
 or
 social
 media.


Most
 resources
 that
 I
 had
 to
 go
 through


were
 either
 academic
 publications
 or


technical
 analysis
 of
 semiconductors
 or


government
 tech
 reports.
 I
 dove
 deep


into
 Switzerland's
 tech
 market
 in
 2025.


And
 spoiler,
 this
 episode
 is
 going
 to
 be


very
 detailed
 and
 probably
 long
 because


there
 is
 surprisingly
 little
 up-to-date


information
 out
 there.
 This
 is
 a
 new


episode
 of
 my
 series
 where
 to
 run
 where


I
 explore
 where
 mid
 to
 senior
 tech


professionals
 rebuild
 their
 careers
 in


the
 aftermath
 of
 the
 pandemic
 and


layoffs
 of
 the
 past
 three
 years.
 And
 on


today's
 episode,
 we've
 got
 Switzerland.


Please
 give
 us
 a
 thumbs
 up.
 We're


working
 very
 hard
 to
 deliver
 the
 most


honest
 and
 real
 content
 on
 the
 state
 of


the
 tech
 market
 in
 the
 post-pandemic


post
 layoff
 AI
 first
 era.
 And
 as
 always,


starting
 with
 tech
 scene
 and
 culture,


the
 Swiss
 tech
 market
 in
 2025
 is


experiencing
 a
 cautious
 recovery
 after
 a


challenging
 period
 marked
 by
 the


pandemic
 and
 the
 significant
 layoffs
 at


the
 end
 of
 2024.
 Switzerland's
 tech


sector
 is
 more
 insulated
 than
 global


hubs
 like
 the
 US,
 Canada
 or
 UK.
 But


nevertheless,
 it
 has
 not
 escaped
 the


global
 wave
 of
 layoffs
 that
 began
 in


late
 2022
 and
 accelerated
 over
 the
 past


3
 years.
 The
 Swiss
 market
 hit
 its
 lowest


point
 at
 the
 end
 of
 2024
 and
 saw
 a


modest
 2%
 increase
 in
 vacancies
 in
 Q1


2025.
 However,
 the
 total
 number
 of


openings
 remains
 9%
 below
 the
 same


period
 in
 2024,
 meaning
 their
 recovery


is
 still
 very
 fragile.
 The
 rebound
 is


uneven
 and
 the
 labor
 market
 still


remains
 strained
 due
 to
 global
 economic


and
 geopolitical
 shifts.
 Let's
 look
 at


the
 layoff
 data.
 In
 2023,
 Google
 Zurich,


Meta,
 Microsoft
 began
 global
 cuts
 which


impacted
 the
 Swiss
 offices.
 Hundreds


were
 laid
 off
 although
 the
 exact
 fang


figures
 are
 not
 public.
 In
 2024,


approximately
 2
 and
 a
 half
 to
 three
 and


a
 half
 thousand
 people
 were
 laid
 off
 at


SD
 Micro
 globally
 with
 a
 significant


share
 in
 Switzerland
 and
 plans
 to
 cut


more.
 Now,
 ST
 Micro,
 for
 those
 who


haven't
 heard
 about
 it,
 is
 a
 European


multinational
 semiconductor


manufacturing
 company
 with
 headquarters


in
 Switzerland.
 On
 this
 channel,
 when
 I


talk
 about
 tech,
 I
 primarily
 speak
 about


SAS
 businesses
 first
 because
 that's
 what


I
 work
 and
 what
 I
 know
 best.
 But
 a
 lot


of
 people
 have
 been
 asking
 to
 expand
 the


scope
 and
 talk
 about
 hardware
 as
 well.


So
 in
 this
 episode
 and
 going
 forward,
 I


will
 be
 covering
 broader
 tech
 including


hardware,
 semiconductors,
 and
 IoT


because
 the
 data
 that
 I
 go
 through


covers
 various
 aspects
 of
 tech.
 In
 2025,


and
 the
 data
 spans
 January
 through
 May,


ST
 Micro
 cut
 3,000
 jobs
 globally,
 and
 a


lot
 of
 them
 were
 cut
 in
 Geneva.
 Swiss


stock
 exchange
 operator
 6
 announced
 up


to
 150
 job
 cuts.
 From
 the
 big
 tech
 side,


there
 have
 been
 further
 cuts
 at


Microsoft.
 I
 also
 found
 this
 chart
 and


as
 you
 can
 see
 Switzerland
 is
 number
 two


in
 Europe
 after
 Sweden
 in
 2025
 layoffs


but
 as
 I
 mentioned
 before
 Sweden's


layoffs
 primarily
 happened
 at
 Northfold


whereas
 in
 Switzerland
 they're
 spread


across
 companies.
 Now
 what's
 driving


layoffs
 in
 Switzerland?
 The
 first
 thing


is
 the
 overhiring
 correction.
 Many


layoffs
 are
 a
 correction
 after


aggressive
 hiring
 during
 the
 pandemic's


time
 especially
 at
 multinational
 tech


firms.
 As
 you
 all
 know
 this
 is
 not


exclusive
 to
 Switzerland.
 Fang
 folks
 in


the
 states
 are
 going
 through
 a
 very


rough
 time
 as
 well,
 just
 like
 it's


pretty
 difficult
 in
 the
 UK
 or
 Ireland.


Reason
 number
 two,
 AI
 and
 automation.


Now,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 data
 that
 suggests


that
 the
 companies
 are
 starting
 to


restructure
 to
 align
 with
 rapid
 AI
 and


automation
 advances,
 reducing
 rules
 in


software
 development,
 support,
 and
 some


engineering
 functions.
 Now,
 despite
 what


the
 big
 publications
 are
 saying,
 I
 am
 of


the
 opinion
 that
 we
 are
 not
 fully
 in
 the


AIdriven
 layoffs
 yet.
 We're
 getting


there.
 That
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 for
 sure.
 But


right
 now,
 the
 layoffs
 caused
 purely
 by


AI
 and
 full
 automation
 are
 quite
 rare.


To
 prove
 my
 point
 that
 the
 bold


click-bated
 statements
 around
 AI
 is


coming
 for
 your
 jobs
 are
 not
 factual
 as


of
 yet,
 here
 are
 some
 AI
 and
 automation


data
 on
 Switzerland.
 46.8%
 of
 Swiss


companies
 use
 AI
 tools
 to
 support


development
 processes.
 But
 of
 those,


only
 42.7
 apply
 AI
 to
 actual
 workflows.


And
 of
 all
 the
 workflows
 that
 rely
 on
 AI


assistance,
 less
 than
 25%
 are
 automated


with
 little
 to
 no
 human
 intervention.


Customer
 service
 and
 IT
 support
 are


seeing
 higher
 automation
 rates.
 But
 for


example,
 CLA
 that
 replaced
 700
 support


agents
 with
 AI
 in
 2022
 later
 reversed


that
 decision
 due
 to
 degraded
 customer


experience.
 Now,
 here
 are
 some
 stats
 on


what's
 really
 being
 automated
 in


Switzerland
 as
 of
 now.
 As
 you
 can
 see,


all
 of
 these
 are
 improvements,


significant
 improvements
 to
 the


workflows,
 but
 not
 full
 replacements.


The
 effects
 of
 AI
 layoffs
 are


incremental
 rather
 than
 absolute.
 So,
 do


not
 blame
 layoffs
 fully
 on
 AI
 just
 yet.


The
 second
 driver
 of
 the
 layoffs
 in


Switzerland
 are
 economic
 headwinds.


Global
 economic
 uncertainty
 and
 the
 US


China
 tech
 war
 caused
 a
 slowdown
 in
 tech


investment
 in
 Europe
 and
 led
 to
 cost


cutting
 and
 consolidation
 particularly


in
 hardware
 and
 semiconductor
 companies.


The
 broader
 Swiss
 tech
 industry,


including
 mechanical
 and
 electrical


engineering,
 continues
 to
 face
 headwinds


with
 sales
 down
 3%
 in
 Q1
 2025
 compared


to
 the
 previous
 year,
 marking
 the
 eighth


consecutive
 quarter
 of
 decline.
 New


orders
 have
 stagnated,
 reflecting
 risks


from
 international
 trade
 tensions.


Sectoral
 impact,
 semiconductors,
 ST


Micros,
 China's
 push
 for
 self-reliance


and
 therefore
 reduced
 EU
 semiconductor


export
 to
 China
 by
 2.1
 billion,
 which
 is


18%
 less
 in
 2024.
 big
 tech
 offices,


Google,
 Zurich,
 Microsoft,
 Meta,
 Amazon,


cuts
 throughout
 the
 entire
 sector
 and
 in


the
 fintech
 space,
 the
 Swiss
 stock


exchange
 and
 some
 banking
 IT
 divisions.


On
 the
 startup
 front,
 some
 smaller
 tech


firms
 have
 downsized,
 but
 the
 details


are
 less
 public.
 Again,
 same
 story
 as


Germany.
 Local
 talent
 is
 very
 expensive


because
 Switzerland
 is
 a
 very
 expensive


country,
 the
 most
 expensive
 one
 in


Europe,
 if
 not
 on
 the
 planet.
 Now,
 let's


talk
 about
 the
 characteristics
 of
 the


Swiss
 tech
 and
 what
 makes
 Switzerland


different.
 Switzerland
 is
 a
 very
 niche


and
 a
 very
 high
 value
 market.
 It's
 small


but
 mighty
 and
 really
 unlike
 anything


else
 in
 Europe.
 Switzerland
 invests


heavy
 in
 highly
 specialized
 technology


such
 as
 hardware,
 sensors,
 ultra-
 low


power
 chips,
 semiconductors,
 medical


tech,
 and
 of
 course
 fintech.
 Why
 such
 a


heavy
 focus
 on
 semiconductors?
 It's
 a


combo
 of
 Swiss
 academic
 history,
 country


strategy,
 and
 niche
 market
 dominance.


ETHZurich
 and
 EPFLAN
 rank
 among
 the


world's
 best
 universities
 for


engineering
 and
 technology.
 They
 do


top-notch
 research
 in
 semiconductor


design
 and
 ultra
 low
 power
 systems.


ETHZurich
 alone
 produces
 more
 than
 one


and
 a
 half
 thousand
 engineering


graduates
 annually,
 many
 entering
 the


semiconductor
 sector.
 Plus,
 Switzerland


has
 launched
 a
 33.8
 million
 Swiss
 Franks


chip
 initiative
 to
 align
 with
 the
 EU
 and


US
 semiconductor
 strategies.
 Another


area
 of
 specialty
 is
 medical
 tech.
 ABBA


fertility
 tracker
 uses
 Swisses
 low
 power


chips.
 IB
 doc,
 the
 smartphone
 based


rapid
 test
 for
 intestinal
 diseases
 which


can
 make
 a
 diagnosis
 in
 15
 minutes.
 AED


tracks
 builds
 IoT
 systems
 that
 monitor


defibrillators
 using
 cloud
 analytics
 to


make
 sure
 that
 they're
 actually
 ready


when
 somebody
 needs
 them
 in
 an


emergency.
 Sensors
 using
 ventilators
 and


insulin
 pumps
 for
 precise
 fluid
 and
 gas


control.
 Last
 but
 not
 least,
 the
 good


old
 Swiss
 banking
 and
 fintech.


Switzerland's
 reputation
 as
 a
 global


banking
 and
 wealth
 management
 center
 and


a
 700year
 banking
 heritage
 gives
 them


deep
 technical
 financial
 expertise
 and
 a


pool
 of
 top
 tier
 financial
 talent.
 The


Swiss
 financial
 market
 is
 known
 for
 its


highly
 pragmatic
 and
 innovationfriendly


approach
 including
 the
 introduction
 of
 a


fintech
 license
 in
 2019.
 Switzerland
 was


among
 the
 first
 to
 create
 a
 legal


framework
 for
 blockchain
 and
 digital


assets
 which
 made
 it
 a
 magnet
 for
 crypto


and
 tokenization
 projects.
 They've
 got


progressive
 and
 welcoming
 approach
 to


open
 banking
 and
 regulatory
 tech.


Notable
 companies,


all
 of
 these
 Switzerland's
 famous


political
 neutrality
 and
 avoidance
 of


being
 the
 EU
 member
 and
 strong


intellectual
 property
 protections


attract
 multinational
 giants
 like
 Google


and
 Microsoft
 to
 establish
 R&D
 centers.


And
 yes,
 layoffs
 are
 happening,
 but
 it


doesn't
 mean
 that
 it's
 all
 over.
 The


industry
 is
 changing,
 not
 dying.
 And
 if


you
 think
 about
 it,
 it's
 no
 wonder
 that


Switzerland
 picked
 this
 strategy.
 They


had
 to
 differentiate
 somehow.
 They
 have


a
 small
 population,
 8.89
 million
 as
 of


2023.
 They
 have
 four
 national
 languages


and
 unique
 dialects,
 two
 of
 which
 are


not
 international.
 Swiss
 German
 is
 a


beast
 of
 a
 dialect
 in
 and
 of
 itself,
 and


French
 is
 the
 only
 spoken
 more
 or
 less


globally,
 but
 it's
 not
 the
 go-to


language
 in
 the
 tech
 industry.
 Swiss


people
 are
 highly
 educated.
 English
 is


commonly
 spoken
 in
 larger
 cities
 and


tech
 hubs.
 But
 outside
 the
 expat
 and


tech
 concentration,
 local
 languages
 are


highly
 prioritized
 and
 as
 I
 have


expressed
 in
 my
 previous
 videos,
 I
 think


that
 the
 prioritization
 of
 local


languages
 is
 a
 great
 thing
 to
 do.
 All
 of


this
 is
 to
 say
 that
 Switzerland's
 tech


scene
 is
 very
 different
 from
 tech
 in


England,
 Germany,
 or
 even
 Sweden.
 They


had
 to
 differentiate
 in
 a
 way
 that
 will


go
 in
 line
 with
 their
 political


neutrality
 and
 being
 fairly
 close
 to


foreigners,
 especially
 non-EU
 nationals.


Onto
 the
 trends
 of
 2025.
 The
 most


sought-after
 skills
 in
 2025
 are


artificial
 intelligence,
 cyber
 security,


cloud
 computing,
 and
 infrastructure


management.
 No
 surprise
 here.
 Employers


are
 also
 prioritizing
 integration


engineers,
 security
 engineers,
 and
 cloud


engineers.
 Cyber
 security
 in
 particular


is
 one
 of
 the
 top
 concerns
 for
 Swiss


businesses
 with
 65%
 of
 executives


identifying
 it
 as
 their
 number
 one


priority.
 I
 also
 found
 some
 social
 proof


from
 people
 who
 currently
 live
 in


Switzerland
 and
 work
 in
 tech,
 saying


that
 the
 only
 feasible
 way
 to
 break
 into


Swiss
 tech
 from
 the
 EU
 is
 through
 cyber


sec
 jobs.
 But
 I
 don't
 have
 personal


experience
 or
 data
 to
 back
 this
 up.


About
 92%
 of
 tech
 job
 postings
 offer


permanent
 contracts
 and
 companies
 are


investing
 heavily
 in
 employee


development
 with
 42%
 funding
 external


learning.
 Now,
 let's
 look
 at
 the
 open


roles
 in
 the
 software
 sector
 because
 I


work
 in
 software
 as
 a
 service
 and
 that's


what
 I
 know
 best.
 But
 in
 the
 future


videos,
 we
 will
 also
 be
 covering
 broader


tech
 roles.
 Now,
 this
 is
 filtered
 down


to
 past
 week
 as
 I
 want
 to
 mimic
 the


experience
 of
 someone
 exploring
 tech


market
 in
 Switzerland
 and
 potentially


applying
 for
 jobs
 because
 if
 you
 know


anything
 about
 LinkedIn
 applications,


you'll
 probably
 know
 that
 there
 is
 no


point
 in
 applying
 for
 roles
 that
 were


posted
 longer
 than
 2
 weeks
 ago.
 Now,


this
 data
 is
 on
 the
 country
 level,
 which


is
 probably
 not
 how
 one
 would
 be
 looking


when
 exploring
 roles
 in
 Switzerland,
 but


I
 wanted
 to
 see
 what's
 happening
 on
 the


national
 level.
 I'm
 filming
 this
 on
 May


29th,
 2025.
 All
 right,
 so
 looking
 at


software
 engineering,
 the
 highest
 number


of
 open
 jobs
 and
 we're
 at
 1,029.
 As
 you


can
 see,
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 openings


are
 in
 Zurich,
 fewer
 in
 Geneva,
 and
 a


couple
 in
 burn.
 Looking
 at
 product


management,
 we
 are
 at
 107
 openings
 and


honestly,
 I
 can't
 remember
 the
 last
 time


I
 saw
 this
 few
 openings
 for
 PMs.
 There


is
 a
 bit
 more
 variety
 here
 with
 Zurich


being
 number
 one
 and
 some
 other
 openings


in
 Loausanne.
 But
 you
 can
 see
 the
 UAE


openings
 here
 as
 well
 with
 relocation


packages.
 Machine
 learning
 and
 data


science
 doesn't
 look
 very
 good
 to
 be


honest
 and
 here's
 why.
 Lastly,
 looking


at
 cyersack
 and
 cloud
 as
 those
 were


listed
 as
 high
 demand
 jobs
 in
 various


sources
 and
 Swiss
 tech
 reports
 that
 I


was
 able
 to
 find.
 So
 despite
 cyersack


and
 cloud
 being
 cited
 as
 the
 most


sought-after
 skills,
 I
 can't
 really
 make


a
 definite
 conclusion
 based
 on
 what
 I'm


seeing
 here.
 But
 then
 also
 remember
 that


the
 job
 postings
 vary
 by
 season.
 Really


curious
 to
 hear
 what
 the
 people
 who
 have


experience
 in
 the
 Swiss
 market
 think
 and


especially
 Swiss
 locals.
 I'll
 be
 honest,


when
 I
 started
 researching
 this
 video,
 I


did
 not
 expect
 to
 see
 numbers
 this
 low.


Thousand
 openings
 for
 software


engineering
 and
 107
 for
 product


management
 for
 the
 entire
 country


considering
 a
 relative
 recovery.
 This


kind
 of
 led
 me
 to
 research
 the
 size
 of


the
 tech
 market
 in
 Switzerland.
 And


because
 it's
 typically
 a
 good
 metric
 to


assess
 the
 overall
 dynamic
 of
 the
 tech


ecosystem
 in
 any
 given
 country.
 So


moving
 on
 to
 the
 tech
 market
 size,
 the


overall
 Swiss
 information
 and


communications
 technology
 market
 which


includes
 SAS,
 IoT,
 system
 design,


hardware,
 is
 expected
 to
 reach
 $129


billion
 in
 2029,
 which
 is
 up
 from
 $17


billion
 in
 2024.
 This
 represents
 a


compound
 annual
 growth
 rate
 at
 8.96%.


Onto
 the
 IT
 service
 market,
 the
 segment


was
 valued
 at
 2.4
 billion
 in
 2024
 and
 is


forecasted
 to
 grow
 at
 6.6%
 through
 2023.


This
 growth
 is
 driven
 by
 cloud
 adoption,


cyber
 security
 demand
 and
 technical


transformation
 initiatives
 and
 the


rollouts
 of
 the
 5G
 networks.
 And
 lastly,


the
 data
 center
 market.
 The
 Swiss
 data


center
 market
 was
 valued
 at
 1.02
 billion


US
 in
 2024
 and
 is
 expected
 to
 nearly


double
 to
 1.99
 billion
 US
 by
 2030,


growing
 at
 11.72%
 annual
 growth.
 Okay,


so
 we've
 looked
 at
 the
 numbers
 and
 yes,


it's
 growing.
 Something's
 happening.
 But


what
 does
 this
 really
 mean?
 Let's
 put


this
 into
 context.
 As
 I
 started
 thinking


about
 how
 I
 would
 put
 this
 into
 context,


it
 took
 me
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 time
 to
 settle


on
 the
 metrics
 that
 I
 thought
 would
 be


appropriate
 for
 this
 context
 and
 find
 a


benchmark
 to
 paint
 the
 picture.


Switzerland
 is
 a
 small
 and
 a
 highly


specialized
 market.
 It's
 premium
 and


niche.
 They
 double
 down
 on
 hardware.


They
 double
 down
 on
 fintech
 and


precision
 industries
 like
 medical
 tech.


So
 comparing
 it
 to
 the
 UK
 or
 Germany


only
 just
 because
 they're
 all
 in
 Europe


is
 not
 really
 a
 fair
 comparison
 in
 my


opinion.
 They're
 very
 different
 in


market
 dynamics.
 that
 are
 very
 different


in
 market
 specializations,
 the


population,
 the
 education
 system,
 and


the
 imported
 talent.
 So,
 the
 countries
 I


picked
 are
 comparable
 in
 terms
 of
 market


size
 dynamics,
 country
 size,
 tech


specialization,
 and
 the
 impact
 on
 the


tech
 industry
 overall.
 And
 the
 table


that
 I
 compiled
 describes
 the
 nuances
 of


each.
 Each
 of
 these
 regions
 has


cultivated
 a
 reputation
 for
 a
 strong


performance
 in
 niche
 fields,
 high
 demand


for
 specialized
 skills,
 and
 a
 focus
 on


specific
 technology
 without
 having


access
 to
 massive
 domestic
 markets
 like


the
 US
 or
 China.
 Additionally,
 these


countries
 often
 outperform
 larger


economies
 and
 innovation
 per
 capita,


offer
 stable
 and
 supportive
 business


environments,
 and
 are
 highly
 connected


to
 the
 global
 tech
 networks,
 which
 is


why
 I
 use
 them
 as
 relevant
 benchmarks.


Moving
 on
 to
 the
 outsourcing
 trends,
 35%


of
 Swiss
 organizations
 plan
 to
 increase


their
 IT
 outsourcing
 activities
 over
 the


next
 2
 years,
 while
 37%
 intend
 to


maintain
 current
 levels.
 Poland,
 Czech


Republic,
 Romania,
 Ukraine,
 and
 Bulgaria


are
 the
 top
 nearshoring
 destinations
 for


Swiss
 companies
 due
 to
 cost
 savings,


cultural
 proximity,
 and
 time
 zone


alignment.
 Remember
 the
 Germany
 video?


Yep,
 nearshoring
 is
 a
 trend,
 and
 it
 will


only
 continue
 growing.
 IT
 services,


cloud
 migration,
 support
 and
 data


analytics
 are
 the
 most
 commonly


outsourced
 functions
 which
 we
 can
 see


from
 the
 number
 of
 job
 postings.


Customer
 service
 is
 also
 increasingly


outsourced.
 Local
 talent
 based
 in


Switzerland
 is
 typically
 hired
 for


projects
 requiring
 strict
 data
 security


compliance
 with
 the
 Swiss
 law
 or
 close


collaboration.
 That
 was
 by
 far
 the


longest
 tech
 scene
 and
 culture
 section


I've
 done.
 Onto
 the
 fun
 stuff.
 Quality


of
 talent.
 Switzerland
 is


internationally
 recognized
 for
 its


exceptional
 quality
 of
 tech
 talent.
 They


have
 a
 world-class
 education
 system.
 The


country
 has
 outstanding
 STEM


universities,
 notably
 ETHZurich,
 which


is
 often
 referred
 to
 as
 the
 best


university
 in
 Europe.
 ETHZurich,
 for


example,
 is
 ranked
 seventh
 in
 the
 world


in
 2025
 and
 is
 renowned
 for
 producing
 22


noble
 laureats,
 including
 Albert


Einstein.
 His
 education
 was
 attributed


to
 Switzerland.
 And
 please
 don't
 forget


all
 of
 these
 people
 who
 have
 less
 media


presence
 than
 Mr.
 Einstein,
 but


absolutely
 deserve
 love
 and
 attention.


Also,
 Federal
 de
 loan
 which
 consistently


ranks
 among
 the
 top
 institutions


globally
 for
 science,
 technology,


engineering
 and
 mathematics.
 EPFL
 is


known
 for
 its
 research
 particularly
 in


computer
 science
 and
 engineering.
 These


universities
 graduate
 thousands
 of


highly
 skilled
 STEM
 professionals
 each


year
 who
 are
 sought
 after
 by
 both
 Swiss


as
 well
 as
 multinational
 tech
 giants.


However,
 despite
 the
 robust
 output
 of


top
 tier
 graduates,
 Switzerland
 faces
 a


persistent
 shortage
 of
 tech
 talent,


especially
 in
 fields
 like
 AI,
 cloud


computing,
 and
 cyber
 security,
 which


leads
 to
 a
 strong
 reliance
 on
 imported


talent.
 Now,
 how
 come
 Switzerland


doesn't
 have
 enough
 domestic
 talent


given
 such
 a
 strong
 educational


foundation?
 There
 are
 a
 few
 reasons.
 Not


enough
 young
 talent
 entering
 the
 field.


The
 number
 of
 young
 people
 graduating


with
 IT
 skills
 is
 not
 keeping
 pace
 with


the
 rapid
 growth
 and
 demand
 for
 tech


roles.
 Switzerland
 has
 a
 pretty
 small


population
 after
 all.
 Again,
 this
 is
 not


exclusive
 to
 Switzerland.
 England
 has


the
 exact
 same
 problem
 with
 not
 enough


youth
 entering
 the
 system.
 Rapid


evolution
 of
 tech,
 the
 pace
 of


technological
 advancements,
 especially


in
 deep
 tech,
 cloud,
 and
 cyber
 security


outstrips
 the
 speed
 at
 which
 new
 talent


can
 be
 trained
 or
 upskilled.
 So
 clearly


there
 is
 a
 strong
 demand
 for
 specialized


talent,
 but
 a
 weak
 supply.
 So
 let's
 talk


about
 where
 Switzerland
 gets
 its
 talent


from.
 Like
 most
 of
 Western
 Europe
 and


the
 world
 in
 general,
 Switzerland's


aging
 population
 and
 declining
 birth


rates
 mean
 they
 have
 no
 choice
 but
 to


rely
 on
 imported
 talent
 to
 meet
 the


technical
 demand.
 However,
 Switzerland


immigration
 system
 has
 been
 historically


regulated
 and
 restrictive,
 especially


for
 non-EU
 and
 non
 EFA
 Iceland
 lienstein


and
 Norway
 nationals.
 But
 in
 the
 light


of
 a
 significant
 talent
 shortage,
 the


Swiss
 government
 is
 supporting
 talent


growth
 with
 work
 permit
 quotas
 which
 is


8
 and
 a
 half
 thousand
 for
 non-EU
 tech


talent
 in
 2025.
 and
 they
 introduce


policies
 to
 attract
 international


talent.
 Now,
 not
 all
 8,000
 permits
 are


allocated
 to
 technical
 roles
 and


competition
 for
 these
 permits
 is
 fierce


across
 multiple
 highskll
 sectors.
 The
 8


half,000
 permits
 are
 split
 into
 4
 and
 a


half
 long-term
 permits
 and
 4,000


short-term
 permits
 for
 non-EU,
 nonfta


nationals.
 So,
 let's
 work
 with
 this


number
 a
 little
 bit.
 8,000.
 Is
 it
 a
 lot?


Is
 it
 a
 little?
 8
 and a
 half
 thousand
 is


approximately.1%


of
 the
 total
 population.
 And
 if
 it
 seems


like
 a
 tiny
 number,
 let
 me
 assure
 you


that
 in
 the
 context
 of
 Switzerland,
 this


is
 them
 being
 very
 generous
 giving
 their


historical
 patterns.
 Switzerland


provides
 just
 enough
 quotas
 to
 fill


critical
 roles
 and
 the
 goal
 behind
 it
 is


to
 maintain
 a
 balance
 between
 economic


needs
 and
 regulated
 immigration.


Switzerland
 has
 been
 historically
 very


difficult
 to
 break
 into,
 and
 I
 don't


blame
 them
 for
 it.
 It's
 just
 something


worth
 noting.
 Here's
 a
 quick
 example


from
 personal
 experience.
 I
 worked
 with


two
 people
 here
 in
 Canada
 in
 late
 2010s


and
 one
 person
 was
 a
 French
 national,


the
 other
 one
 was
 Belgian.
 Both
 of
 them


were
 good
 friends
 and
 both
 of
 them
 went


to
 study
 in
 the
 states.
 Both


exceptionally
 skilled
 technical


architects,
 one
 was
 a
 data
 architect
 and


the
 other
 one
 was
 a
 software
 architect.


And
 the
 person
 from
 France
 was
 a
 Harvard


and
 MIT
 grad
 and
 the
 person
 from
 Belgium


was
 a
 Carnegie
 Melon
 alum.
 Both
 highly


experienced,
 both
 got
 experience
 from


the
 states.
 Both
 went
 back
 to
 Europe


after
 studying
 and
 working
 in
 the
 US.


both
 tried
 to
 get
 into
 Switzerland
 and


both
 had
 zero
 luck.
 Now,
 I'm
 well
 aware


that
 two
 people
 is
 not
 representative
 at


all,
 but
 I
 just
 remember
 being
 shocked


at
 the
 time
 when
 I
 heard
 how
 difficult


it
 was
 to
 break
 into
 Switzerland.
 So,


that's
 just
 a
 little
 story
 from
 personal


experience.
 The
 vibe.
 Let's
 talk
 about


what
 it
 feels
 like
 to
 work
 in


Switzerland
 in
 some
 of
 their
 biggest


tech
 hubs.
 Each
 city
 has
 its
 own


personality,
 and
 trust
 me,
 the


differences
 matter
 more
 than
 you
 think.


Zurich
 is
 Switzerland's
 financial
 and


tech
 capital,
 offering
 great
 salaries,


buzzing
 international
 scene.
 Fast-paced,


research-driven,
 and
 dense
 with
 global


tech
 giants
 and
 startups.
 ETH
 plays
 a


big
 role
 in
 the
 city's
 tech
 culture,


similar
 to
 how
 Stanford
 influences
 the


vibe
 of
 the
 Silicon
 Valley.
 It
 is
 known


for
 Google
 Zurich,
 Google's
 largest


engineering
 office
 outside
 of
 the
 United


States,
 Scandit,
 computer
 vision,


barcode
 scanning,
 augmented
 reality,


Beekeeper,
 Workforce
 Management,
 Deep


Code,
 acquired
 by
 Sneak,
 a
 fantastic


company,
 and
 I've
 been
 fortunate
 enough


to
 deal
 with
 some
 of
 the
 Sneaks
 folks.


It
 is
 a
 very
 strong
 global
 developer


security
 company.
 IBM
 Research
 known
 for


its
 breakthroughs
 in
 quantum
 computing,


AI,
 and
 blockchain.
 Zurich
 is


predominantly
 German
 speaking,
 Swiss


German,
 I'd
 like
 to
 emphasize,
 which
 can


be
 challenging
 even
 for
 native
 German


speakers.
 English
 is
 the
 lingua
 frana
 in


many
 tech
 workplaces,
 especially
 at


multinationals
 and
 startups.
 But
 knowing


the
 local
 language
 is
 a
 significant


advantage
 for
 integration
 and
 career


progression.
 Plenty
 of
 expats


successfully
 work
 in
 Swiss
 tech
 without


full
 fluency
 in
 a
 national
 language


particularly
 in
 technical
 roles.
 But


again,
 career
 progression
 very
 often
 as


you
 know
 depends
 on
 your
 network.
 Also,


Zurich
 is
 known
 for
 eyewatering
 prices.


Geneva
 more
 international,
 more


diplomatic.
 It
 is
 home
 to
 the
 United


Nations,
 World
 Trade
 Organization,


International
 Monetary
 Fund,
 European


Organization
 for
 Nuclear
 Research,
 and


hundreds
 of
 NOS's.
 For
 the
 technative


companies,
 the
 biggest
 ones
 are
 Teos


Banking
 Software,
 SD
 Micro,


Semiconductors,
 and
 Sensors.
 Salaries


are
 competitive
 with
 Zurich,
 and
 rent


prices
 are
 slightly
 friendlier,
 although


we're
 still
 talking
 expensive.
 In
 fact,


when
 you
 hear
 Switzerland,
 it's
 almost
 a


rule
 of
 thumb
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 be


expensive.
 Lozanne,
 home
 to
 EPFL,
 very


strong
 emphasis
 on
 AI,
 robotics,
 and


medtech
 and
 R&D
 with
 a
 French-speaking


academic
 and
 startup
 ecosystem.
 It
 is


very
 academic
 and
 very
 R&D.
 Lozanne
 is
 a


Swiss
 and
 European
 leader
 in
 medical


tech,
 biotech
 and
 advanced
 engineering


with
 startups
 like
 Luna
 and
 Readily
 3D


at
 the
 forefront.
 They
 also
 pioneer


development
 in
 clean
 techch
 and
 space


tech
 and
 of
 course
 cyber
 security
 with


companies
 like
 Wiz,
 which
 is
 a
 3D


biometric
 authentication.
 Now,
 each
 city


has
 its
 own
 regional
 nuances.
 In
 Geneva,


it's
 about
 diplomatic
 circles.
 In


Zurich,
 you
 better
 speak
 Swiss
 German
 if


you
 want
 those
 doors
 to
 open
 fully
 for


you.
 Lozanne
 with
 burn
 or
 B
 have
 these


tight-knit
 professional
 communities


where
 relationship
 really
 matter,


meaning
 the
 language
 really
 matters,


too.
 Cost
 of
 living.
 Switzerland
 is


notorious
 for
 having
 one
 of
 the
 world's


highest
 costs
 of
 living.
 Remember
 how
 I


told
 you
 that
 there
 is
 very
 little


content
 about
 the
 Swiss
 tax
 scene?
 Well,


let
 me
 tell
 you
 that
 if
 there
 is
 one


topic
 about
 Switzerland
 that
 is
 widely


discussed
 on
 the
 internet
 and
 on
 social


media,
 it's
 the
 cost
 of
 living.
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 get
 into
 much
 detail
 as
 there


is
 plenty
 of
 videos
 from
 the
 people
 who


actually
 live
 there.
 But
 as
 I
 was
 doing


the
 research,
 I
 came
 across
 a
 bunch
 of


videos
 where
 the
 Swiss
 living
 on
 the


border
 with
 France
 do
 grocery
 shopping


in
 France
 and
 how
 there
 is
 a
 limit
 to


how
 much
 meat
 they
 can
 bring
 back
 with


them.
 These
 substantial
 living
 expensive


create
 a
 unique
 economic
 environment


where
 high
 salaries
 don't
 necessarily


translate
 to
 wealth
 accumulation.
 Now,
 I


personally
 wouldn't
 call
 Switzerland
 a


country
 that
 you
 come
 to
 to
 accumulate


wealth
 fast.
 And
 this
 applies
 to
 Western


and
 Northern
 Europe
 in
 general.
 It
 is
 a


place
 where
 it's
 much
 easier
 to
 preserve


wealth
 than
 to
 make
 it.
 In
 my
 personal


opinion,
 Europe
 is
 really
 good
 for
 two


cohorts
 of
 people.
 The
 first
 cohort
 is


when
 you
 want
 a
 really
 beautiful,


aesthetically
 beautiful
 and
 comfortable


life,
 and
 you're
 perfectly
 happy
 with


being
 middle
 class.
 You
 appreciate
 your


quality
 of
 life.
 You
 appreciate
 your


weekend
 travels,
 etc.
 You
 do
 not
 need
 a


house
 with
 four
 parking
 spots.
 And
 the


second
 cohort,
 you
 either
 grow
 up
 with


money
 or
 you
 bring
 money
 with
 you
 to


Europe.
 Switzerland
 has
 one
 of
 the


highest
 levels
 of
 wealth
 concentration


in
 the
 world
 and
 a
 significant
 share
 of


its
 richest
 residents
 inherited
 their


wealth.
 Research
 shows
 that
 60%
 of


Switzerland's
 richest
 people
 acquired


their
 fortunes
 through
 inheritance


compared
 to
 31%
 in
 the
 US
 where


self-made
 wealth
 is
 much
 more
 common.


that
 upward
 mobility
 is
 possible
 in


Switzerland,
 especially
 if
 we're
 talking


about
 those
 high
 demand
 sectors.
 But
 the


scale
 and
 the
 fluidity
 of
 the
 economy


differs
 significantly
 from
 the
 US.
 Now,


I'm
 making
 an
 emphasis
 on
 the
 money


aspect
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who


contemplate
 Switzerland
 have
 these


romanticized
 dreams
 of
 how
 rich
 they're


going
 to
 get
 if
 they
 move
 there.
 They


see
 the
 salary
 comparison
 to
 the
 US
 and


they
 go,
 "This
 is
 the
 US
 of
 Europe."
 No,


it
 is
 not
 the
 US.
 Salary
 is
 not
 the
 only


factor
 that
 defines
 your
 earning


potential.
 Switzerland
 is
 not
 a
 place


for
 raxs
 to
 reach
 his
 stories
 on
 the


scale
 of
 California
 or
 Texas.
 But
 on
 the


other
 hand,
 you
 can
 become
 a
 very
 solid


upper
 middle
 class
 or
 even
 affluent
 by


European
 standards.
 And
 if
 you
 are
 a


highly
 skilled
 individual
 whose


specialty
 is
 in
 very
 high
 demand
 and
 if


you're
 able
 to
 integrate
 well
 into
 the


Swiss
 society.
 Also,
 Switzerland
 has
 a


nuanced
 tax
 system
 with
 taxes
 at
 the


federal,
 canonal,
 and
 municipal
 levels.


For
 tech
 workers
 who
 come
 from
 abroad,


the
 permit
 type
 determines
 if
 they're


taxed
 from
 their
 salary
 or
 annually.


There
 are
 also
 pet
 taxes.
 You
 know how
 I


typically
 include
 taxes
 in
 my
 tables,


but
 for
 Switzerland,
 I
 decided
 not
 to
 to


avoid
 people
 losing
 their
 in
 the


comments
 saying
 that,
 well,
 I
 pay
 more


or
 I
 pay
 half
 of
 that.
 But
 what
 I
 have


to
 say
 is
 that
 taxes
 are
 not
 very
 high


compared
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 Europe
 or


Canada.
 Conclusion:


Switzerland
 is
 a
 unique
 place
 for
 tech


in
 Europe.
 It's
 unlike
 any
 other
 country


I've
 discussed
 in
 this
 series.
 It
 has


the
 most
 specialized
 tech
 market
 on
 the


continent
 in
 fields
 like
 fintech,


semiconductors,
 cyber
 security
 with
 the


highest
 salaries
 in
 Europe
 comparable
 to


the
 US
 and
 the
 highest
 prices.
 So
 when


does
 Switzerland
 make
 sense?
 It
 makes


sense
 if
 you
 are
 a
 Swiss
 national
 with


network
 graduating
 local
 schools,


well-versed
 in
 the
 culture
 and
 language


and
 a
 clear
 advantage
 in
 job
 access
 and


integration.
 It
 makes
 sense
 if
 your


partner
 is
 Swiss
 and
 you're
 exploring


the
 Swiss
 tech
 scene,
 knowing
 that


you've
 got
 someone
 to
 rely
 on
 should


things
 go
 wrong.
 It
 makes
 sense
 if


you're
 coming
 into
 the
 country
 with
 a


strong
 compensation
 package
 and
 a
 highly


specialized
 profession
 that
 Switzerland


really
 needs.
 It
 makes
 sense
 if
 you're


an
 EU
 citizen
 and
 especially
 if
 you're


coming
 from
 Italy,
 France,
 Belgium,
 or


Germanspeaking
 countries
 and
 you're


going
 to
 the
 canton
 where
 your
 native


language
 is
 commonly
 spoken.
 Your


integration
 will
 be
 a
 lot
 smoother.


Switzerland
 is
 a
 perfect
 country
 for


people
 who
 are
 not
 looking
 for


lavishness
 or
 ostentatious
 wealth.
 It's


a
 polar
 opposite
 to
 the
 UAE,
 for


example.
 It's
 the
 country
 of
 quiet


luxury
 where
 you
 can
 make
 a
 shitload
 of


money
 but
 be
 perfectly
 comfortable


biking
 home
 and
 living
 in
 something
 that


looks
 like
 this.
 Many
 well-paid
 folks


live
 very
 modestly
 by
 North
 American


standards,
 favoring
 quality,
 privacy,


and
 understated
 comfort.
 When
 does
 it


not
 make
 sense?
 If
 you
 are
 an
 EU


national
 exploring
 tech
 markets
 and
 need


a
 job
 within
 a
 foreseeable
 future,
 I


would
 not
 count
 on
 Switzerland
 given
 the


number
 of
 open
 rules.
 If
 it
 pans
 out,


great,
 but
 I
 wouldn't
 count
 on
 it.
 You


saw
 the
 number
 of
 job
 listings
 and
 the


work
 permits
 they
 issue.
 If
 you
 are
 an


American
 citizen
 exploring
 European
 tax


scene
 and
 you
 want
 to
 keep
 your
 American


quality
 of
 life
 with
 tax
 salaries,
 I


highly
 recommend
 that
 you
 explore
 Reddit


threads.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 comments


from
 American
 expats
 saying
 that
 their


purchasing
 power
 plummeted
 after
 I
 moved


to
 Switzerland.
 Especially
 factoring
 in


housing
 and
 daily
 expenses.
 And
 if
 you


have
 children
 and
 both
 parents
 are


working,
 meaning
 you
 need
 someone
 to


look
 after
 your
 kids
 while
 you're
 at


work,
 yeah,
 good
 luck
 with
 child
 care


costs.
 Also,
 the
 Swiss
 tech
 job
 market


is
 highly
 competitive
 and
 selective
 with


a
 preference
 for
 local
 or
 EU
 EFTA


candidates,
 and
 the
 US
 is
 not
 part
 of


either
 of
 these
 alliances.
 It
 is


probably
 not
 suitable
 if
 you're
 middle


class
 with
 ambitions
 to
 become
 wealthy.


Switzerland
 is
 very
 attractive
 to
 those


who
 are
 already
 established
 and
 seek


stability,
 not
 for
 those
 looking
 for


rapid
 wealth
 accumulation
 or
 flashy


lifestyle.
 And
 that's
 a
 wrap.


Switzerland,
 I
 would
 love
 to
 hear
 your


take
 on
 this.
 I
 had
 a
 blast
 doing


research
 about
 your
 country.
 Let
 me
 know


what
 you
 guys
 think
 in
 the
 comments.
 The


next
 episode
 is
 coming
 very
 soon.
 As


always,
 I
