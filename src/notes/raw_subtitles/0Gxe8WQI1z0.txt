Hey,
 I'm
 Jan.
 You
 probably
 noticed
 I'm


not
 in
 a
 studio
 right
 now.
 And
 that's


because,
 well,
 we're
 building
 one
 from


the
 ground
 up
 with
 new
 floors,
 new


tables,
 new
 chairs,
 the
 whole
 works.
 And


honestly,
 we're
 building
 more
 than
 just


a
 studio.
 We're
 building
 a
 whole
 new


show.
 The
 news
 moves
 fast
 these
 days.


Headlines
 change
 by
 the
 hour,
 and
 some


weeks
 feel
 like
 years.
 It's
 a
 lot,
 and


it
 can
 be
 hard
 to
 keep
 up.
 So,
 we
 want


to
 give
 you
 a
 place
 to
 pause
 and
 take
 a


breath,
 a
 place
 to
 help
 you
 make
 sense


of
 what's
 going
 on.
 So,
 every
 episode


we'll
 take
 one
 topic,
 just
 one,
 and
 look


at
 it
 from
 a
 few
 different
 angles.
 And


we're
 starting
 with
 immigration.
 Who


gets
 to
 come
 here?
 Why
 do
 some
 people


decide
 to
 leave?
 What's
 working
 in
 our


system
 and
 what
 isn't?
 Welcome
 to
 the


first
 episode
 of
 the
 rundown.


More
 highly
 skilled
 immigrants
 are


choosing
 to
 leave
 Canada
 and
 build
 their


futures
 elsewhere.
 What
 could
 convince


people
 to
 stay
 in
 this
 country
 long


term?
 Daniel
 Burnernhard,
 CEO
 of
 the


Institute
 for
 Canadian
 Citizenship,
 has


some
 answers.


>> Daniel,
 welcome
 to
 our
 makeshift
 studio


at
 the
 Rundown.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Great
 to
 see
 you.


Now,
 let's
 talk
 about
 your
 new
 report.


Your
 new
 report
 identifies
 two
 factors


that
 motivate
 immigrants
 to
 stay
 in


Canada.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 the
 first
 one.


Optimism
 about
 the
 future
 sounds
 pretty


obvious,
 but
 what's
 the
 deciding
 factor?


Why
 is
 that?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 first
 just
 a
 quick
 word
 if


we
 can
 about
 the
 importance
 of


retention.
 You
 know,
 there's
 a
 growing


anti-immigrant
 sentiment
 in
 Canada.
 A


lot
 of
 people
 who
 think
 that
 basically


every
 problem
 in
 Canada
 is
 just
 an


immigration
 problem
 from,
 you
 know,


housing,
 healthcare,
 etc.
 Uh
 but
 no


matter
 your
 view
 on
 these
 things,
 as
 the


number
 of
 immigrants
 uh
 is
 reduced,
 as


the
 population
 ages,
 uh
 it
 becomes
 even


more
 important
 to
 retain
 the
 people
 who


are
 already
 here
 and
 who
 are
 established


and
 are
 contributing
 to
 our
 society.
 So


that's
 what
 our
 report
 uh
 sought
 to


identify
 what
 triggers
 people
 to
 stay.


And
 optimism
 for
 the
 future
 is
 actually


a
 really
 interesting
 one.
 So
 many
 of
 the


statistics
 look
 at
 how
 much
 money
 people


are
 making
 their
 current
 condition.
 What


this
 shows
 is
 actually
 immigrants
 are
 uh


very
 practical.
 They
 understand
 that
 it


takes
 some
 time
 to
 establish
 yourself
 in


a
 new
 country,
 in
 a
 new
 society,
 and


they're
 willing
 to
 to
 put
 in
 the
 work
 uh


so
 long
 as
 there's
 a
 credible
 hope
 that


that
 investment
 will
 pay
 off.
 And
 so,


it's
 not
 so
 much
 how
 well
 am
 I
 doing


today,
 but
 how
 confident
 am
 I
 that
 my


work
 will
 pay
 off
 tomorrow.
 And
 uh
 and


it
 seems
 like
 a
 very
 very
 powerful


factor
 um


that
 determines
 whether
 people
 stay
 or


go.
 Now,
 I
 should
 note
 it
 said
 in
 your


in
 your
 report,
 1%
 increase
 in
 optimism


boosts
 the
 likelihood
 of
 staying
 by
 28%.


That
 seems
 pretty
 massive.


>> It's
 a
 huge
 and
 powerful
 lever.


>> All
 right,
 let's
 talk
 about
 the
 second


factor.
 Sense
 of
 identity
 and
 belonging.


Of
 course,
 another
 one
 that
 sounds


pretty
 straightforward.
 This
 saw
 an


increase,
 a
 1%
 increase
 in
 a
 sense
 of


belonging
 was
 a
 25%
 likelihood
 that
 they


would
 stay.


>> Yeah.
 And
 we've
 always
 talked
 about


Canada's
 welcoming
 disposition
 as
 though


it's
 this
 like
 nice
 thing
 that
 we
 do.


Okay,
 we're
 welcoming.
 We're
 open.
 But


what
 this
 data
 actually
 uh
 reveals
 is


that
 a
 welcoming
 disposition
 is
 now
 a


core
 success
 strategy
 for
 Canada.
 Um,


you
 know,
 immigrants
 are
 leaving
 the


country
 at
 record
 rates
 and
 the
 most


coveted
 or
 prioritized
 immigrants,
 the


economic
 highly
 skilled
 immigrants
 are


actually
 leaving
 at
 much
 higher
 rates


than
 than
 everybody
 else.
 And
 so
 that


friendly
 feeling,
 uh,
 that
 neighborhood


barbecue,
 that
 time
 when
 your
 kids
 can


play
 together
 in
 the
 parks,
 that's
 more


than
 just
 a
 kind
 gesture.
 That's


actually
 now
 a
 contribution
 that
 each
 of


us
 can
 make
 to
 ensure
 that
 this
 talent


stays
 in
 Canada
 to
 play
 for
 our
 team


instead
 of
 leaving
 uh
 uh
 to
 play
 for
 an


opposing
 team
 in
 an
 increasingly


difficult
 and
 fractious
 world.


>> You
 talk
 about
 uh
 economic
 immigrants.


I'm
 going
 to
 throw
 another
 uh
 group
 in


there,
 franophones.
 Uh
 these
 are
 two


categories
 that
 the
 government


prioritizes
 uh
 but
 are
 most
 likely
 to


leave
 Canada.
 How
 come?


>> Well,
 there
 are
 a
 number
 of
 reasons
 for


this.
 Um,
 the
 franophhone
 uh
 case
 is
 a


little
 bit
 different.
 The
 government
 has


decided
 to
 use
 uh
 the
 immigration
 system


basically
 as
 a
 a
 mechanism
 for
 trying
 to


maintain
 the
 balance
 of
 bilingualism


outside
 of
 Quebec.
 Uh
 I'm
 not
 so
 sure


that
 that's
 the
 best
 tool
 for
 the
 job,


but
 that's
 what
 they're
 doing.
 What


people
 are
 finding
 is
 that
 they
 arrive


in
 Manitoba,
 for example,
 uh
 in


notionally
 uh
 bilingual
 communities


where
 they
 can
 use
 government
 services


in
 French,
 they
 can
 go
 to
 the
 movies
 in


French.
 Uh
 but
 the
 economy
 actually
 in


practice
 works
 in
 English
 and
 so
 they


can't
 find
 work
 in
 French.
 Uh
 and
 that


makes
 it
 very
 very
 difficult.
 So
 they're


leaving
 at
 you
 know
 70%
 higher
 rates


over
 the
 long
 term
 than
 uh
 than
 um


immigrants
 in
 general.
 And
 the
 highly


skilled
 economic
 class
 immigrants
 um
 are


are
 also
 leaving
 at
 at
 very
 high
 rates


and
 and
 we're
 now
 starting
 to
 see


actually
 they're
 also
 leaving
 faster.
 So


the
 contribution
 period
 is
 shorter.


Anyone
 who
 runs
 a
 business
 knows
 that


it's
 uh
 easier,
 better,
 uh
 more


profitable
 uh
 to
 retain
 a
 customer
 that


you
 have
 instead
 of
 going
 out
 and


finding
 a
 new
 one.
 So
 churn
 is
 is
 a
 real


problem
 uh
 for
 Canada
 and
 it's
 exactly


the
 same
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 talent
 for


the
 country.


>> All
 right,
 Daniel.
 So
 the
 Institute
 for


Canadian
 Citizenship
 found
 in
 an
 earlier


report
 that
 one
 in
 five
 immigrants
 who


come
 to
 Canada
 leave
 within
 25
 years.


However,
 a
 third
 of
 those
 people
 don't


even
 wait
 that
 long.
 they
 leave
 within


the
 first
 five
 years.
 What
 are
 your
 top


recommendations
 for
 policy
 makers
 to


keep
 immigrants
 in
 Canada?


>> Well,
 if
 we
 look
 at
 these
 reports
 um
 uh


the
 the
 the
 report
 that
 we
 just
 issued


uh
 recently,
 these
 two
 factors,
 future


optimism
 and
 identity
 belonging.
 Let's


look
 at
 those.
 So,
 what
 does
 future


optimism
 look
 like?
 Future
 optimism


looks
 like
 the
 opportunity
 to
 re-qualify


in
 the
 profession
 that
 you
 had
 in
 your


country
 of
 origin.
 Maybe
 not
 today,


>> but
 in
 a
 reasonable
 period
 in
 the


future.
 Um,
 future
 optimism
 looks
 like


my
 kids
 are
 well
 established
 in
 the


school
 and
 and
 are
 learning
 and
 have


friends
 and
 are
 happy.
 Future
 optimism


looks
 like
 my
 neighbors
 actually
 care


about
 me
 being
 here
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 can
 see


myself
 being
 part
 of
 this
 community
 if


not
 immediately
 than
 then
 one
 day.
 Uh,


so
 I
 think
 there
 are
 a
 number
 of
 um
 of


uh
 of
 reforms
 on
 the
 professional
 side


especially
 that
 that
 can
 help
 to
 boost


this
 optimism
 and
 identity
 and


belonging.
 This
 one
 is
 is
 in
 some
 sense


actually
 easier.
 Uh
 our
 organization


operates
 a
 program
 called
 the
 canoe
 pass


c.
 If
 you're
 a
 permanent
 resident
 within


your
 first
 five
 years,
 please
 download


it
 uh
 and
 enjoy
 it.
 It's
 entirely
 free.


Gives
 you
 access
 to
 over
 2,000
 culture,


nature,
 and
 sport
 experiences
 across
 the


country.
 Uh
 programs
 like
 Canoe
 help


people
 to
 integrate
 not
 in
 a
 classroom


sense,
 not
 in
 some
 artificial
 abstract


sense,
 but
 just
 practically
 into


everyday
 life.
 To
 sit
 next
 to
 you
 at
 a


CFL
 game,
 uh
 to
 uh
 to
 be
 with
 you
 and


your
 kids
 and
 their
 kids
 at
 the
 science


center,
 uh
 to
 travel
 on
 a
 train
 trip,


for
 example,
 on
 via
 rail
 uh
 somewhere,


to
 to
 explore
 national
 parks
 and


provincial
 parks.
 These
 types
 of


experiences
 are
 actually
 really


powerful.
 And
 again,
 it's
 not
 just
 about


being
 nice.
 It's
 about
 making
 sure
 that


that
 doctor,
 that
 engineer,
 that
 uh
 that


scientist,
 that
 software
 developer,
 that


cyber
 security
 expert,
 all
 these
 people,


they're
 handpicked
 to
 address
 Canada's


most
 pressing
 needs.
 And
 when
 they


leave,
 the
 needs
 that
 they
 are
 brought


here
 to
 address
 don't
 leave
 with
 them,


>> right?
 Uh
 so
 if
 we
 fail
 to
 retain
 uh


these
 talented
 people
 to
 play
 for
 our


team,
 it's
 not
 just
 the
 immigrants
 who


lose
 having,
 you
 know,
 felt
 like
 they


might
 have
 wasted
 some
 some some
 prime


years
 of
 their
 life.
 It's
 actually
 all


of
 us
 Canadians
 that
 lose
 um
 with
 with


longer
 weight
 times
 in
 hospitals,
 with


longer
 weight
 lists
 in
 child
 care,
 uh


with
 more
 costly
 and
 numerous
 cyber


security
 attacks.
 This
 is
 about
 us
 and


our
 collective
 interest,
 not
 about


compassion
 for
 immigrants,
 but
 about


Canada's,
 you
 know,
 strategy
 to
 succeed.


You
 talked
 about
 sort
 of
 the
 the


sentiment
 at
 the
 moment.
 Can
 you
 give
 us


some
 hope
 in
 that
 conversation
 for
 a
 lot


of
 people
 who
 might
 be
 saying,
 well,


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 immigrants
 right
 now


and
 there
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 blame
 in


that
 direction,
 but
 as
 you
 mentioned,


there
 are
 some
 gaps
 that
 need
 to
 be


filled
 and
 it
 is
 essentially
 what
 this


country
 is
 been
 made
 of.
 I
 understand


people
 are
 feeling
 squeezed.
 Um,
 life
 is


really
 expensive.
 Trying
 to
 buy
 or
 rent


a
 house
 or
 an
 apartment
 is
 really


expensive.
 Food
 is
 really
 expensive.
 And


so
 people
 are
 in
 protection
 mode.
 They


want
 to
 safeguard
 what
 they
 have.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 a
 natural
 response.
 My
 my


invitation
 uh
 to
 people
 who
 are
 worried


about
 immigrants
 basically
 coming
 to
 eat


off
 their
 plate
 um
 is
 to
 remember
 that


Canada
 is
 hardly
 full.
 Uh
 we
 are
 a
 big,


rich,
 bountiful
 country.
 And
 to
 the


politicians
 and
 policy
 makers,
 we
 talk


about
 building
 houses,
 but
 what
 about


building
 cities?
 uh
 you
 know
 and
 and
 and


new
 industries
 and
 a
 new
 frontier
 like


we
 have
 so
 much
 opportunity
 here
 that
 we


can
 harness
 and
 um
 we
 just
 need
 to
 think


I
 believe
 um
 a
 little
 bit
 beyond
 the


current
 circumstances.
 If
 you
 believe


that
 your
 best
 days
 are
 behind
 you
 as
 a


country
 then
 it
 makes
 sense
 to
 try
 and


just
 safeguard
 what
 you
 have.
 Um,
 if
 you


have
 some
 optimism
 for
 the
 future,
 then


uh
 it
 makes
 sense
 to
 to
 welcome
 people


to
 help
 to
 contribute
 to
 the
 strength


and
 success
 and
 growth
 and
 development


and
 advancement
 of
 your
 country
 because


they
 want
 to
 play
 on
 your
 team
 and
 make


it
 stronger.


>> Daniel,
 we're
 going to
 leave
 it
 there.


Thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Temporary
 foreign
 workers
 are
 one
 of
 the


groups
 of
 immigrants
 most
 often
 in
 the


headlines.
 So,
 who
 qualifies
 for
 the


program
 and
 how
 does
 it
 work?
 Producer


Sangita
 Patel
 explains.


>> We're
 hearing
 a
 lot
 about
 temporary


foreign
 workers
 in
 the
 news,
 but
 who
 are


they?
 A
 temporary
 worker
 is
 someone
 who


comes
 to
 Canada
 for
 a
 limited
 period
 of


time.
 It's
 a
 broad
 category
 that


includes
 a
 number
 of
 subgroups
 like


international
 students
 and
 people
 in
 the


country
 on
 humanitarian
 work
 visas.
 But


when
 we're
 talking
 about
 Canada's


temporary
 foreign
 worker
 program,
 that's


a
 specific
 category
 of
 workers.
 TFWs
 are


hired
 when
 an
 employer
 is
 unable
 to
 find


a
 Canadian
 or
 a
 permanent
 resident
 to


fill
 a
 job
 and
 a
 worker
 is
 only
 allowed


to
 be
 employed
 between
 1
 and
 3
 years.


The
 temporary
 foreign
 worker
 or
 TFW


program
 began
 in
 1973
 as
 a
 way
 to
 get


highskilled
 labor
 into
 the
 country,
 but


it's
 gone
 through
 a
 number
 of
 changes
 in


the
 nearly
 50
 years
 since
 the
 program


first
 began.
 First
 in
 1992,
 it
 was


expanded
 to
 include
 live-in
 caregivers.


Then
 in
 2002,
 it
 changed
 again
 to
 allow


low-skilled
 workers
 to
 enter
 the


country.
 The
 number
 of
 TFWs
 grew
 in
 size


until
 2014
 when
 the
 federal
 government


imposed
 some
 reforms.
 After
 those


reforms,
 the
 number
 of
 TFWs
 decreased
 in


the
 country
 for
 a
 period
 of
 2
 years,
 but


began
 increasing
 again
 in
 2017.
 The


other
 change
 that
 happened
 in
 2014
 was


splitting
 the
 program
 into
 two
 branches,


the
 temporary
 foreign
 worker
 program
 and


the
 International
 Mobility
 Program
 or


IMP.
 So,
 what's
 the
 difference
 between


the
 TFW
 program,
 which
 we
 hear
 a
 lot


about,
 and
 the
 lesserk
 known
 IMP?


Let's
 start
 with
 temporary
 foreign


workers.
 Employers
 wanting
 to
 bring
 in
 a


TFW
 have
 to
 fill
 out
 a
 labor
 market


impact
 assessment
 application
 or
 an


LMIA.
 Yeah,
 another
 acronym.
 And


employers
 have
 to
 prove
 that
 they
 tried


to
 find
 a
 Canadian
 or
 permanent
 resident


to
 do
 the
 job.
 It's
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 to


fill
 in
 one
 of these
 forms,
 and
 it


involves
 very
 specific
 steps
 to
 follow.


Businesses
 that
 want
 to
 bring
 in
 a
 TFW


also
 have
 to
 pay
 about
 a
 $1,000


processing
 fee.
 And
 there's
 currently
 a


10%
 cap
 on
 the
 number
 of
 TFWs
 you
 can


have
 at
 a
 specific
 work
 location.
 That


changes
 for
 some
 industries
 like


construction,
 food
 manufacturing,


hospitals,
 nursing,
 or
 inhome
 childare.


There,
 the
 cap
 is
 20%.
 Now,
 let's
 look


at
 the
 international
 mobility
 program.


The
 IMP
 has
 fewer
 rules.
 It
 doesn't


require
 an
 LMIA,
 so
 you
 don't
 have
 to


prove
 you
 can't
 find
 a
 Canadian
 or


permanent
 resident
 to
 do
 a
 job,
 and
 it


has
 a
 lower
 processing
 fee.
 So,
 who
 are


these
 workers
 in
 the
 IMP?
 The
 program


can
 include
 workers
 like
 intercomp


transfers.
 So,
 say
 that
 you
 have
 a


marketing
 director
 in
 London
 that
 you


want
 to
 bring
 in
 from
 your
 international


office
 and
 permits
 for
 workers
 under


international
 agreements
 like
 KASMA
 or


the
 EU
 trade
 agreement.
 So,
 that's
 the


story
 of
 the
 TFW
 program.
 In
 2024,
 TFWs


made
 up
 only
 12%
 of
 the
 close
 to
 1
 6


million
 temporary
 residents
 admitted
 to


Canada.
 IMP
 workers
 made
 up
 45%
 and


international
 students
 made
 up
 32%.


The
 temporary
 foreign
 worker
 program
 is


facing
 criticism
 from
 the
 left
 and
 the


right.
 Some
 people
 think
 the
 program


should
 be
 reformed.
 Some
 think
 it
 should


be
 cut
 altogether.
 Does
 the
 country
 need


it?
 I
 sat
 down
 with
 Muel
 Scooter,
 an


economics
 professor
 at
 the
 University
 of


Wateroo,
 and
 Elizabeth
 Long,
 an


immigration
 lawyer
 and
 a
 partner
 at
 LM


Law
 Group.


Elizabeth
 Miguel,
 nice
 to
 have
 you
 on


our
 program.
 Thank
 you
 for
 making
 it
 to


our
 makeshift
 uh
 studios.
 The
 temporary


foreign
 worker
 program
 has
 come
 under


fire
 on
 all
 political
 spectrums.
 For


instance,
 Conservative
 leader
 Pierre


Polyv
 as
 well
 as
 BC's
 NDP
 premier
 David


Eie
 all
 calling
 it
 for
 to
 be
 scrapped
 as


a
 result
 saying
 it's
 resulted
 in
 rather


high
 youth
 unemployment.
 Is
 this


criticism
 justified?


>> There's
 absolutely
 no
 question
 that
 the


growth
 we've
 seen
 in
 youth
 unemployment


is
 not
 a
 consequence
 a
 cause
 of
 the


temporary
 foreign
 worker
 program.
 the


the
 growth
 we've
 seen
 in
 in
 youth


unemployment
 is
 a
 consequence
 of
 a


dramatic
 decline
 in
 the
 number
 of
 job


vacancies
 in
 Canada.
 In
 the
 summer
 of


2022,
 we
 had,
 you
 may
 have
 remember
 the


headlines,
 we
 had
 almost
 a
 million
 job


vacancies
 in
 Canada.
 Over
 the
 following


three
 years,
 they've
 dropped
 by
 more


than
 50%.


>> So,
 we
 now
 have
 less
 than
 half
 a
 half
 a


million
 job
 vacancies.
 The
 people
 who


are
 going
 to
 struggle
 are
 the
 people
 who


are
 trying
 to
 find
 a
 job.
 When
 there
 are


no
 new
 jobs
 being
 created,
 new
 labor


market
 entrance
 like
 young
 people
 and


new
 immigrants
 are
 going
 to
 feel
 that


the
 most
 and
 that's
 where
 we
 see
 the


biggest
 increases
 in
 unemployment.


Elizabeth


>> and
 remember
 the
 temporary
 foreign


worker
 program
 probably
 consists
 of
 only


onetenth
 of
 the
 total
 amount
 of
 work


permit
 holders
 are
 that
 are
 here
 in


Canada.
 Most
 work
 permit
 holders
 have


open
 work
 permits.
 you're
 not
 part
 of


the
 temporary
 foreign
 worker
 program.
 In


fact,
 the
 temporary
 foreign
 worker


program
 is
 the
 most
 scrutinized
 area
 for


work
 permits.
 The
 employers
 actually


have
 to
 try
 to
 prove
 that
 they
 can't


find
 Canadians
 who
 can
 do
 the
 job.
 So
 if


we're
 looking
 at
 just
 numbers,
 the


temporary
 form
 worker
 program
 um
 forms


such
 a
 small
 subset
 of
 the
 just
 even


temporary
 form
 workers
 in
 Canada.


>> Is
 that
 we
 talk
 about
 how
 small
 of
 a


percentage
 it
 is.
 This
 is
 not
 the
 first


time
 that
 this
 program
 in
 its
 50
 plus


years
 of
 existence
 has
 been
 scrutinized.


What
 is
 it
 about
 the
 program
 that
 seems


to
 be
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 obvious
 sort
 of


reason
 people
 are
 picking
 at
 it?


>> So,
 it's
 not
 random
 when
 it
 becomes


controversial.
 It
 becomes
 controversial


when
 the
 program
 is
 growing
 at
 the
 same


time
 as
 unemployment
 rates
 are
 rising.


The
 optics
 of
 the
 program
 don't
 make


sense
 to
 people
 at
 the
 time
 for
 good


reason.
 So
 you
 know
 when
 you
 see
 youth


unemployment
 and
 you
 see
 a
 dramatic


growth
 in
 this
 program
 which
 we
 have


seen
 in
 recent
 years
 you
 know
 the
 the


employers
 do
 have
 to
 go
 through
 this


test
 to
 show
 that
 they
 can't
 hire


domestically
 that
 test
 has
 become
 a


rubber
 stamp.
 So
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 data


the
 the
 approval
 rates
 were
 reaching


over
 98%.
 I
 mean
 they
 were
 just
 rubber


stamping
 and
 so
 the
 growth
 in
 recent


years
 has
 just
 been
 tremendous
 and
 the


optics
 of
 that
 are
 not
 good.
 It's
 a


small
 program,
 but
 it
 doesn't
 make
 much


sense
 to
 be
 growing
 this
 program
 at
 a


time
 when
 the
 unemployment
 rate
 is


rising.


>> All
 right,
 Elizabeth,
 um
 I
 want
 to
 quote


uh
 the
 premier
 in
 BC
 said,
 "We
 can't


have
 an
 immigration
 program
 that
 results


in
 high
 youth
 unemployment.
 Is
 the


increase
 in
 the
 number
 of
 temporary


residents
 making
 it
 more
 difficult
 for


younger
 Canadians
 to
 find
 employment?"
 I


hear
 anecdotally
 from
 people
 across
 this


province
 who
 are
 saying,
 "My
 daughter,


you
 know,
 my
 son
 is
 struggling
 to
 find
 a


job.
 Is
 there
 an
 actual
 correlation


between
 the
 two?


>> Well,
 I
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 distinguish


between
 the
 number
 of
 overall
 people
 who


are
 in
 Canada
 who
 have
 open
 work
 permits


from
 the
 temporary
 foreign
 worker


program.
 The
 temporary
 foreign
 worker


program
 uh
 the
 government
 has
 uh
 worked


since
 last
 year
 to
 dramatically
 reduce


the
 number
 of
 people
 who
 can
 qualify
 for


it.
 For
 the
 most
 part
 right
 now,
 people


who
 are
 able
 to
 qualify
 to
 employers
 are


able
 to
 qualify
 to
 even
 apply,
 they
 have


to
 have
 um
 salaries
 of
 high
 wage,
 which


in
 most
 places
 are
 well
 over
 $30
 an


hour.
 M
 so
 those
 kind
 of
 jobs
 aren't


really
 the
 kind
 of
 jobs
 that
 compete


with
 entrylevel
 jobs
 that
 youth


unemployment
 uh
 seems
 to
 uh
 grow
 uh
 in


these
 kind
 of
 situations.
 Um
 so
 if
 we're


just
 looking
 at
 the
 temporary
 foreign


worker
 program
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 issues


and
 I
 I
 agree
 you
 know
 there
 are
 a
 lot


of
 issues
 with
 the
 temporary
 form
 worker


program.
 agree
 that
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 parts


the
 examination
 of
 the
 recruitment


um
 may
 not
 be
 it's
 kind
 of
 artificial


when
 you
 ask
 the
 employers
 to
 um
 recruit


try
 to
 recruit
 Canadians
 when
 they
 have


already
 identified
 someone
 in
 their


mind.
 Um,


>> is
 this
 recruitment
 really
 um
 real
 or
 is


it
 more
 of
 a
 sort
 of
 ritual,
 a
 sort
 of
 a


recruitment
 requirement
 that
 is


artificial?


>> Can
 you
 give
 us
 an
 example
 of
 what
 that


would
 look
 like
 in
 a
 particular
 job


field?


>> Right.
 So
 for
 example,
 if
 an
 employer


wants
 to
 apply
 for
 a
 labor
 market
 impact


assessment,
 which
 is
 the
 basis
 of
 the


temporary
 form
 worker
 program,
 um
 they


would
 have
 to
 undergo
 very
 restrictive


advertising.
 So
 they
 would
 have
 to


advertise
 at
 the
 job
 bank,
 they
 would


have
 to
 advertise
 in
 at
 least
 two
 other


uh
 places
 in
 in
 in
 Canada.
 Um
 and
 on
 the


advertisements
 they
 there
 the
 wording
 on


it
 is
 very
 specific.
 So
 you
 have
 to
 put


things
 like
 what
 language
 is
 spoken
 in


the
 workplace,
 what
 um
 you
 know
 what


duties
 there
 are
 and
 wages
 etc.
 And
 a


lot
 of
 times
 for
 employers
 this
 is
 not


the
 normal
 way
 that
 they
 would
 go
 about


finding
 someone.
 Um
 but
 for
 the
 most


part
 employers
 who
 come
 to
 us
 if
 they


want
 to
 go
 through
 the
 temporary
 foreign


worker
 program
 we
 would
 have
 to
 ask
 them


to
 readvertise
 otherwise
 their


applications
 would
 be
 denied.
 Um
 and
 so


a
 lot
 of
 times
 this
 program
 creates
 a


situation
 where
 this
 artificial
 part
 of


it
 doesn't
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.
 There


are
 better
 ways
 to
 get
 labor
 market


benefits
 than
 forcing
 this
 artificial


recruitment.
 On
 a
 note
 that
 Elizabeth


mentioned
 earlier,
 there
 is
 um
 there's
 a


perception
 that
 temporary
 foreign


workers
 hold
 lower
 paying
 jobs.
 Uh
 and


if
 the
 program
 was
 scrapped,
 Canadians


might
 not
 be
 willing
 to
 fill
 those
 ones.


Is
 that
 a
 fair
 assumption?
 So
 the


biggest
 part
 of
 the
 growth
 in
 the


program
 in
 recent
 years
 has
 been
 in
 jobs


that
 require
 high
 school
 or
 less.


>> So
 that
 it
 is
 true
 that
 this
 growth
 has


mostly
 been
 very
 lowkilled
 work.
 you


know,
 would
 these
 jobs
 be
 filled
 by
 by


by
 young
 Canadians
 if
 if
 the
 program
 was


shut
 down?
 You
 know,
 I
 wouldn't
 think
 of


it
 like
 that.
 I
 It's
 the
 wrong
 way
 to


think
 about
 economies
 work.
 That
 jobs


are
 just
 fixed
 things
 that
 somebody
 has


to
 fill
 this
 slaughter.
 The
 whole


economy
 starts
 to
 fall
 apart.
 It's
 just


not
 the
 right
 way
 to
 think
 about
 how


economies
 work.
 You
 know,
 tight
 labor


markets,
 we
 talk
 about
 them
 like
 they're


a
 problem.
 They're
 actually
 very
 good


for
 an
 economy,
 especially
 an
 economy


that
 struggles
 with
 productivity
 like


Canada
 does.
 What
 a
 tight
 labor
 market


does
 is
 it
 forces
 employers
 to
 work
 a


lot
 harder
 to
 try
 and
 attract
 scarce


workers
 to
 try
 and
 improve
 working


conditions
 to
 try
 and
 improve


productivity
 to
 invest
 in
 new


technologies
 to
 get
 more
 out
 of
 the


workers
 that
 you
 currently
 have.
 These


are
 all
 things
 Canada's
 in
 desperate


need
 of.
 So
 that's
 the
 sense
 in
 which


you
 know
 the
 temporary
 foreign
 worker


program
 is
 not
 a
 huge
 program
 but


there's
 no
 single
 solution
 that's
 going


to
 solve
 Canada's
 productivity
 problems


and
 this
 is
 just
 part
 of
 that
 system
 of


moving
 the
 dial
 in
 a
 way
 that's
 not


coddling
 business
 in
 the
 way
 that
 we've


been
 doing
 for
 many
 years.
 Elizabeth
 do


you
 want
 to
 weigh
 in
 on
 that?


>> Yeah.
 So
 the
 temporary
 foreign
 worker


program
 has
 two
 subsets.


There
 are
 the
 uh
 work
 like
 seasonal


agricultural
 work,
 you
 know,
 factory


work,
 sometimes
 restaurants
 in
 in
 you


know
 northern
 or
 less
 populated
 areas


where
 you
 they
 just
 can't
 find
 workers.


They
 can't
 find
 bodies
 to
 do
 this
 work.


Now,
 this
 has
 been
 severely
 restricted


recently
 by
 the
 federal
 government
 um


for
 the
 most
 part
 of
 Canada.
 There
 are


some
 rural
 areas
 where
 there
 and
 some


areas
 like
 construction
 where
 there
 are


still
 exemptions.
 The
 other
 part
 of
 it


are
 the
 very
 highly
 specialized
 kind
 of


work
 um
 you
 know
 certain
 kinds
 of


engineers
 certain
 kind
 of
 scientists


where
 someone
 the
 the
 employer
 just


can't
 find
 those
 kind
 of
 skills
 to
 do


the
 work.
 Now
 we
 have
 a
 uh
 program


called
 uh
 the
 global
 talent
 stream
 which


is
 a
 subset
 of
 the
 LMAS
 that
 targets
 um


STEM
 workers
 so
 engineers
 scientists
 and


these
 kind
 of
 this
 program
 is
 unique
 in


that
 it
 doesn't
 require
 the
 employer
 to


have
 that
 sort
 of
 artificial


recruitment.
 That
 program
 instead
 says,


"Well,
 employer,
 you
 want
 to
 hire
 this


highly
 specialized
 worker.
 We
 recognize


that
 there
 is
 a
 shortage
 of
 these


occupations,
 but
 certainly
 you
 have
 to


pay
 the
 median
 wage
 for
 the
 occupation.


you're
 not
 going
 to
 depress
 any
 wages,


but
 also
 we
 want
 you
 to
 provide
 a
 labor


market
 benefit
 plan
 where
 you're
 going


to
 provide
 three
 labor
 market
 benefits


such
 as
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 hiring
 more


um
 Canadians.
 So,
 if
 you're
 going
 to


hire
 this
 foreign
 worker,
 for
 example,


you're
 going
 to
 hire
 another
 Canadian
 as


well.
 You're
 going
 to
 invest
 money
 in


training
 Canadians
 um
 and
 and
 so
 on
 and


so
 on.
 So
 this
 program
 is
 a
 very


interesting
 program
 to
 me
 because
 it


cuts
 away
 from
 the
 artificiality
 of
 the


recruitment
 and
 in
 the
 meantime
 it
 makes


the
 employer
 if
 you
 really
 need
 this


person
 to
 actually
 also
 go
 and
 promise


to
 add
 labor
 market
 benefits.


>> Um
 and
 it's
 been
 a
 very
 popular
 program


because
 it's
 fast
 as
 well.


>> Do
 you
 want
 to
 chime
 in
 on
 that?


>> That's
 hugely
 important.
 I
 mean
 that's
 a


big
 part
 of
 the
 problem.
 This
 program


exists
 as
 a
 way
 to
 recruit
 talent
 from


abroad.
 This
 is
 an
 excellent


>> example
 of
 where
 this
 program
 does
 not


need
 to
 be
 shut
 down.
 This
 is
 exactly
 as


as
 the
 US
 looks
 to
 shut
 down
 the
 H-1B


program.
 This
 is
 the
 route
 to
 to
 h


recruit
 people,
 get
 them
 on
 the
 ground


running
 very
 quickly.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 this


is
 a
 very
 mixed
 program.
 There
 are
 parts


of
 it
 that
 need
 to
 be
 curtailed,
 perhaps


even
 phased
 out,
 but
 this
 is
 not
 one
 of


them.
 If
 you
 had
 the
 ear
 of
 uh


immigration
 minister
 Alina
 Dyap,
 uh
 if


there
 was
 one
 change
 that
 you
 would
 like


to
 see
 to
 the
 program,
 what
 would
 that


be?
 So
 I
 think
 the
 low
 skill
 streams


need
 to
 fa
 be
 phased
 out.
 See
 the
 the


the
 cost
 here
 is
 that
 every
 time
 the


unemployment
 rate
 goes
 up,
 this
 becomes


a
 big
 issue,
 right?


>> That's
 not
 good
 for
 the
 Canadian


immigration
 system.
 when
 people
 start


not
 trusting
 the
 system,
 um
 questioning


immigration
 in
 general
 because
 of
 a


program
 that's
 actually
 quite
 small,


that's
 not
 working,
 right?
 Um
 we
 got
 to


do
 this
 differently.
 We
 got
 to
 stop
 this


cycle
 of
 this
 program
 becoming
 so


contentious.
 And
 the
 way
 to
 do
 it,
 I


think,
 is
 there
 is
 a
 price
 that


employers
 have
 to
 pay
 when
 they
 hire
 a


temporary
 foreign
 worker.
 They
 pay


$1,000
 per
 position
 through
 this
 LMIA.


That's
 a
 really
 interesting
 policy


instrument
 that
 the
 government
 can
 use.


So
 they
 can,
 you
 know,
 increase
 the


price
 where
 unemployment
 rates
 are


higher.
 They
 can
 increase
 the
 price


where
 we
 think
 there
 are
 occupations


that
 are
 more
 slack.
 Um,
 but
 I
 think
 the


main
 thing
 you
 can
 do
 is
 you
 want
 to


ensure
 businesses
 aren't
 using
 this
 as


kind
 of
 a
 business
 strategy.
 You
 know,


trying
 to
 get
 profit
 margins
 by
 keeping


your
 labor
 costs
 low.
 That's
 not
 where


we
 want
 to
 go
 with
 this.
 So
 where
 you


see
 employers
 repeatedly
 year
 after
 year


using
 this
 program,
 you
 can
 escalate
 the


price.
 So
 the
 price
 you
 pay
 for
 an
 OMIA


gets
 higher
 and
 higher
 every
 year
 to


kind
 of
 wean
 these
 businesses
 off.
 I


think
 over
 a
 3
 to
 5
 year
 horizon,
 I'd


like
 to
 see
 the
 low
 wage
 streams
 get


phased
 out.
 Okay,
 Elizabeth,


>> I
 think
 there
 are
 some
 nuances
 to
 this


because
 there
 are
 some
 jobs
 that


irrespective
 of,
 you
 know,
 how
 how
 much


you
 want
 to
 recruit
 Canadians,
 you're


not
 going
 to
 have
 that
 many
 Canadians


working
 in
 the
 fields.
 You're
 not
 going


to
 have
 that
 many
 people
 working
 in
 the


restaurants
 in
 northern
 BC.
 And
 there


are
 some
 skills
 uh
 even
 if
 it's


low-skilled
 that
 employers
 are
 going
 to


need
 to
 hire
 um
 uh
 workers
 who
 are


willing
 to
 do
 that.
 Um
 I
 think
 in
 terms


of
 the
 higher
 skills
 um
 there
 are
 there


are
 amendments
 to
 the
 program
 that


should
 be
 in
 place.


>> And
 what
 do
 those
 look
 like?
 I
 think
 uh


number
 one
 look
 at
 the
 global
 talent


stream
 and
 look
 at
 what
 works
 in
 the


global
 talent
 stream
 the
 benefits
 that


the
 employers
 are
 going
 to
 bring
 to
 the


economy.
 Um
 look
 and
 don't
 throw
 away


the
 baby
 with
 the
 bathwater.
 You
 know,


we
 have
 certain
 elements
 of
 our


immigration
 system
 that
 is
 vital
 to
 the


growth
 of
 our
 economy
 that's
 vital
 to


our
 uh
 employers,
 to
 our
 companies.


Right
 now,
 we
 have
 people
 who
 have


invested
 their
 lives
 in
 Canada,
 who
 have


been
 here
 for
 years,
 who
 have
 been


educated
 here
 for
 years,
 and
 we
 need


people
 in
 Canada
 to
 be
 taxpayers
 for
 the


future.
 Um,
 so
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 good


things
 with
 our
 immigration
 system
 and


if
 we
 don't
 work
 to
 keep
 them,
 then
 we


will
 suffer
 a
 great
 loss
 for
 the
 future


in
 terms
 of
 our
 reputation,
 in
 terms
 of


our
 businesses,
 and
 in
 terms
 of
 our


communities
 as
 well.


>> All right,
 we're
 going
 to
 leave
 it


there.
 Muel
 Elizabeth,
 thank
 you
 so


much.
 Really
 appreciate
 the


conversation.


>> Thank
 you.


And
 that's
 it
 for
 us
 here
 at
 the


Rundown.
 Our
 studio
 is
 under


construction
 and
 so
 is
 our
 show.
 We
 want


you
 to
 help
 us
 build
 it.
 The
 show,
 not


the
 studio.
 So
 send
 us
 your
 feedback
 and


ideas.
 Email
 us
 at
 rundown
 at
 tvbo.org.


See
 you
 tomorrow.


Tomorrow
 on
 the
 rundown.
 I
 acknowledge


that
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 know
 um


tension
 and
 um
 just
 uncertainty
 about


how
 to
 manage
 these
 situations.
 Uh
 but
 I


think
 the
 key
 one
 is
 empathy.
 How
 is
 my


expression
 going
 to
 be
 received
 by
 the


other
 person?
 And
 if
 another
 person
 were


to
 say
 something
 that
 I
 completely


disagree
 with,
 how
 should
 I
 how
 will
 I


receive
 that?
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 that
 that


is
 one
 of
 the
 key
 messages
 that
 all


employers
 should
 be
 putting
 out
 there


is,
 you
 know,
 have
 more
 empathy
 in
 the


way
 that
 you
 express
 yourself
 because


however
 you
 may
 be
 hurting
 other
 people,


you
 may
 also
 be
 subject
 to
 that.
 And


when
 when
 if
 we
 don't
 do
 that,
 the


problem
 is
 that
 situations
 will


escalate.
 And
 you
 know,
 may
 that
 never


happen,
 then
 you
 know,
 we
 have
 violence


in
 the
 workplace.
 One
 of
 the
 key
 things


that
 we
 tell
 all
 our
 employers,
 our
 our


clients
 is
 that
 um
 they
 have
 an


obligation
 to
 have
 a
 respectful
 work


environment.
 That
 is
 an
 actual
 legal


obligation.
 And
 so
 if
 employers
 cannot


guarantee
 that,
 you
 know,
 employees
 can


have
 uh
 a
 good
 resource
 to
 go
 against


their
 businesses.

 us
 tomorrow

 the
 rundown.
