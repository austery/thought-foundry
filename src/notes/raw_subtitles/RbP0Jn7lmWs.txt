Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.


We
 are
 live
 and
 oh
 my,
 what
 a
 week
 it


has
 been.
 It
 is
 freaking
 Wednesday
 and


it
 feels
 like
 we've
 lived
 through
 a
 year


over
 the
 past
 couple
 days.
 Nvidia
 is
 a


$5
 trillion
 market
 cap
 company.
 As
 for


the
 pre-markets,
 Nvidia
 right
 here,
 $28.


I
 mean,
 you'd
 think
 cracking
 200
 would


be
 a
 massive
 deal.
 We
 are
 well
 above
 200


at
 this
 point.
 208
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 up


3.4%.
 Uh
 S&P
 500
 trying
 to
 get
 to
 690
 at


688.
 You
 got
 pounds
 here
 at
 191.
 There's


a
 lot
 to
 recap
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 happened


yesterday
 and
 get
 into
 all
 the
 different


stuff
 that
 that
 uh
 the
 macro
 will
 have


in
 terms
 of
 an
 implication
 of
 what


happened
 yesterday.
 When
 I
 mean
 macro,
 I


mean
 the
 broader
 AI
 capex
 theme
 because


it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 that's
 slowing
 down


based
 on
 what
 Nvidia
 said.
 So,
 we're


going
 to
 talk
 about
 that.
 But
 on
 top
 of


that,
 you
 got
 FOMC
 in
 about
 five
 hours


and
 JPAL
 hopefully
 giving
 us
 that
 cut
 is


also
 going
 to
 help
 a
 lot
 of
 these


equities
 and
 the
 broader
 markets
 risk
 on


assets.
 And
 then
 you
 have
 Meta,


Microsoft,
 and
 Google
 all
 reporting
 at


the
 same
 time.


This
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 wild
 day.
 There's


I
 mean
 there's
 there's
 there's
 just
 no


there's
 no
 other
 way
 to
 describe
 it


other
 than
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 crazy
 day.


We
 also
 have
 earnings
 right
 now
 in
 the


pre-market
 and
 some
 of
 those
 earnings


have
 not
 been
 the
 best.
 Uh
 cough
 cough


ferve.


I
 I
 mean
 I
 know
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 what


fiserve
 does,
 but
 this
 is
 a
 large
 cap


company
 down
 40%.
 You
 don't
 see
 that
 uh


you
 don't
 see
 that
 too
 often,
 but
 we'll


talk
 about
 that.
 I'll
 talk
 about
 the


implications.
 Obviously,
 they
 missed
 on


earnings,
 reduced
 their
 guidance,
 and


that's
 why
 this
 got
 hit
 pretty
 bad.
 Uh,


but
 Nvidia
 really
 is
 a
 story,
 and
 I


think
 that's
 creating
 a
 lot
 of


implications
 for
 a
 variety
 of
 different


things
 that
 are
 going
 on.
 So,
 we're


going
 to
 get
 into
 Nvidia.
 Let's
 talk


about
 what
 happened
 with
 China
 last


night.
 Trump
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 comments
 he


made,
 which
 is
 really
 important.
 There's


some
 breaking
 news
 in
 the
 pre-markets


that
 Nvidia
 ended
 up,
 or
 not
 Nvidia,


China
 ended
 up
 buying
 a
 ton
 of
 soybeans


as
 a
 act
 of
 goodwill
 to
 the
 United


States.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 that's
 another


reason
 why
 Nvidia
 is
 moving.
 I
 mean,


there's
 just
 so
 many
 different
 headlines


of
 things
 that
 are
 going
 on,
 whether


it's
 China,
 big
 tech,
 FOMC,
 Nvidia,


Palanter,
 Nvidia
 partnership
 yesterday.


So,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 discuss,
 a
 lot
 to
 go


on,
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 keep
 going
 from


there.
 Fubo,
 is
 that
 up?
 I
 have
 not


looked
 at
 that
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 That


is
 Wow.
 Green.
 Okay.
 Looks
 like
 there
 is


some
 level
 of
 conclusion
 to
 the
 deal


that
 they
 have
 with
 Disney.
 I
 don't
 have


the
 exact
 headline
 on
 that.
 I'm
 seeing


this
 for
 the
 first
 time
 right
 now,
 but


if
 you
 are
 in
 Fubo,
 congrats.
 That
 one


is
 definitely
 moving
 right
 here.


And
 it
 looks
 like
 there
 should
 be
 some


level
 of
 conclusion
 that
 investors
 have


been
 waiting
 for.
 The
 merger
 is


official.
 Fubo
 Disney
 Hulu
 Plus
 live
 TV


complete
 business
 combination
 creating


unique
 consumer
 focused
 new
 team.
 All


right,
 there
 you
 go.
 Fubu
 Fubo
 and


Disney's
 Hulu
 Plus
 and
 live
 TV
 package


has
 officially
 completed
 a
 merger.
 6


million
 subscribers
 in
 North
 America.


This
 makes
 it
 the
 sixth
 largest
 pay
 TV


provider
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Disney


now
 owns
 over
 70%
 of
 the
 company,
 while


Fubu
 shareholders
 retain
 about
 30%.
 Both


services
 will
 continue
 to
 operate


separately.
 Fubo
 CEO
 David
 Gander
 will


lead
 the
 company's
 operations.
 Their


advertising
 sales
 group
 will
 now
 be


handled
 by
 Disney's
 advertising
 team.


The
 company
 expects
 savings
 on
 content


costs
 and
 better
 advertising
 revenue.


Okay,
 there
 you
 go.
 There's
 Fubo.
 Uh


this
 is
 this
 is
 thing
 people
 have
 been


waiting
 for
 for
 almost
 two
 years
 now.


The
 uh
 from
 getting
 sued
 by
 Disney
 to


getting
 to
 cooperate
 with
 Disney.


I
 don't
 know
 where
 the
 stock
 ends,
 but


you
 definitely
 got
 the
 street
 that's


excited
 about
 it.
 26%
 right
 here
 in
 the


pre-markets
 for
 FUBO.


All right,
 so
 uh
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 here,
 I


think,
 pretty
 much
 all
 day.
 I
 think


we're
 doing
 the
 whole
 stream,
 the
 whole


day.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 to
 reserve


some
 of
 my
 energy
 in
 terms
 of
 my
 voice


and
 not
 scream
 for
 the
 next
 two
 hours,


which
 usually
 from
 like
 8
 to
 11,
 that's


what
 I
 do.
 But
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 to
 be
 a


little
 bit
 more
 calm
 so
 that
 we
 can
 hold


up
 the
 energy.
 But
 I
 think
 I'll
 be
 here


the
 whole
 I'll
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 people


join
 me
 throughout
 the
 day
 and
 so
 it


should
 be
 fun.
 Uh
 but
 we're
 going
 to


have
 FOMC
 pretty
 soon
 and


and
 uh
 then
 we
 are
 going
 to
 see
 you
 know


what
 happens
 with
 big
 tech
 earnings
 and


hopefully
 that
 can
 continue
 giving


momentum.
 All
 right,
 so
 let's
 talk
 about


Nvidia.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 Nvidia.
 Is


Amazon
 running?


I
 try
 to
 talk
 about
 something
 and
 then


something
 happens
 and
 then
 boom,
 I
 can't


talk
 about
 what
 I
 was
 talking
 about.
 Why


is
 Amazon
 running
 232?


By
 the
 way,
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 going
 to
 talk
 a


lot
 more
 about
 Amazon
 later.
 I
 think


there
 might
 be
 a
 headline
 right
 now.
 But


guys,
 these
 layoffs
 like
 it's
 a
 big


deal.
 Amazon
 fired
 14,000
 people


yesterday.
 And
 I
 was
 on
 TikTok
 and
 I


just
 typed
 in
 Amazon
 layoffs
 and
 I
 tried


to
 see
 like
 like
 real
 people
 talking


about
 it.
 It's
 a
 big
 deal,
 bro.
 It's
 a


And
 I
 have
 some
 videos
 I
 want
 to
 share


with
 everybody.
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 if
 anyone


has
 any
 experience.
 There
 was
 a
 couple


of
 Amazon
 engineers
 here
 in
 the
 chat


that
 said
 they
 narrowly
 escaped
 getting


fired.
 14,000
 people
 didn't.
 And
 so
 this


layoff
 stuff
 is
 is
 getting
 a
 bit
 more


aggressive.
 Now,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 think


it's
 because
 of
 AI
 replacing
 these


workers.
 Based
 on
 the
 research
 I
 did


yesterday,
 that's
 not
 true.
 There's


actually
 another
 reason
 associated
 with


AI,
 but
 it's
 not
 AI
 literally
 replacing


workers.
 And
 so,
 we're
 going
 to
 talk


about
 what's
 kind
 of
 going
 on
 here.


Okay.
 The
 only
 headline
 I
 see
 is
 an


anthropic
 headline,
 but
 this
 happened
 an


hour
 ago.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 Amazon's


getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 juice
 and
 a
 bit
 of
 a


run
 right
 here.


But
 um


I
 don't
 see
 anything
 else
 creating
 the


move
 on
 Amazon.
 23261.
 It
 is
 a
 bigger


move.
 Amazon
 doesn't
 tend
 to
 be
 that


volatile
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 This


anthropic
 headline
 is
 relatively
 old


news.
 I
 mean
 most
 people
 knew
 that
 they


were
 working
 together
 and
 extending


their
 partnership.
 So
 I
 don't
 see


anything
 right
 now.
 But
 oh
 no,
 I
 got
 it.


Wait,
 no.
 This
 is
 also
 old.
 Amazon
 Wait,


is
 this
 old?


Uh
 all right.
 The
 headline,
 Amazon's
 AWS


to
 fuel
 South
 Korea's
 AI
 hub
 with
 a
 new


$5
 billion
 investment.


You
 know,
 Trump's
 in
 South
 Korea
 right


now.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 talk
 about
 Amazon
 with


a
 a
 timely
 announcement
 to
 make
 sure
 the


South
 Koreans
 are
 happy.
 I
 mean,
 yeah,


there
 you
 go.
 That's
 the
 headline.


Amazon
 AWS
 plans
 $5
 billion
 AI
 data


center
 in
 South
 Korea.


There
 you
 go.
 That
 is
 it.
 That's
 what's


getting
 the
 market
 to
 be
 excited.
 And


then
 the
 anthropic
 deal
 together,
 I


guess,
 is
 uh
 helping
 it
 as
 well.
 All


right.
 Look,
 we've
 been
 talking
 about


Amazon
 for
 a
 while.
 I
 think
 for
 the
 past


month,
 we've
 been
 talking
 about
 Amazon.


Uh
 213
 212
 versus
 the
 lows.
 It's
 it's


it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 company
 that
 does
 a


trillion
 dollars
 in
 revenue
 over
 the


next
 few
 years.
 It
 is
 one
 of the
 most


important
 companies
 on
 the
 planet.
 I


think
 even
 at
 these
 levels,
 I
 mean,
 the


riskreward
 is
 not
 as
 attractive
 as
 it


was
 at
 212,
 but
 if
 you
 think
 it's
 going


to
 300,
 which
 I
 think
 most
 people
 agree


300
 is
 where
 this
 thing
 has
 a
 date
 with


Destiny,
 and
 maybe
 it's
 not
 this
 year,


but
 probably
 closer
 to
 the
 end
 of
 2026,


then
 this
 is
 a
 good
 quality
 Mac
 7


company
 to
 have
 in
 the
 portfolio.
 And


now
 with
 this
 recent
 move,
 it
 is
 now
 up


uh
 four
 plus
 7%
 year-to
 date,
 which
 is,


you
 know,
 not
 really
 performing
 on
 the


level
 of
 even
 the
 S&P.
 So,
 I
 still
 think


the
 riskreward
 long-term
 is
 not
 that


bad.
 Amazon
 right
 there
 233
 that
 is


green
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 All right,
 so


let's
 talk
 about
 Nvidia
 and
 let's
 get


into
 Nvidia
 real
 quick.
 Let's
 just


handle
 Fiserve
 and
 we'll
 talk
 about


that.
 So,
 Fiserve
 missed
 on
 their


earnings
 and
 they
 missed
 pretty
 badly.


This
 is
 the
 first
 company
 that
 actually


missed
 in
 a
 way
 that's
 like
 really


disgusting
 and
 that's
 why
 you're
 seeing


some
 pain
 right
 here.
 So
 Fiserve
 they


lowered
 their
 guidance
 for
 the
 full
 year


and
 they
 missed
 on
 EPS
 by
 23%
 missed
 on


revenues
 by
 8%
 4.9
 billion
 versus
 5.3


204
 versus
 265.
 Let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat


if
 anyone
 owns
 Ferve
 or
 if
 you've
 been


familiar
 with
 this
 stock.
 Uh
 this
 is
 in


the
 payments
 space
 and
 as
 a
 result
 you


got
 shift
 4
 that's
 getting
 hit
 in


sympathy
 down
 4%
 and
 then
 when
 we
 talk


about
 payments
 we
 can't
 forget
 about


PayPal
 which
 is
 basically
 lost
 most
 of


its
 gains.
 gains.
 I
 mean,
 yesterday
 it


was
 up
 15%,
 pretty
 much
 lost
 all
 of
 it.


It
 was
 actually
 red
 uh
 about
 20
 minutes


ago.
 7342,
 but
 all
 the
 payment
 stocks


getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 hit.
 Let
 me


see
 if
 CLA
 is
 getting
 hit
 on
 this
 as


well.
 CLA.
 Yeah,
 CLA's
 down.
 I
 I
 I
 mean,


we're
 going
 to
 go
 deeper
 into
 the


earnings
 later
 and
 see
 what
 exactly
 got


the
 street
 to
 be
 this
 upset,
 but
 I


believe
 it's
 the
 reduction
 of
 their


fiscal
 year
 2026
 forecast
 on
 EPS
 by
 a


wide
 margin
 that
 got
 the
 street
 to
 think


this
 is
 just
 not
 going
 very
 well.
 And


you
 know,
 the
 only
 argument
 I
 can
 say


right
 here
 a
 as
 someone
 who
 hasn't


really
 dug
 that
 deep
 into
 the
 earnings


is
 there's
 a
 potential
 crypto
 headwind


for
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 payment
 companies
 as


more
 people
 are
 using
 other
 payment


guard
 rails
 to
 be
 able
 to
 transact
 or
 to


send
 money
 or
 to
 trade
 or
 to
 do
 a


variety
 of
 different
 things.
 Fiserve
 now


mainly
 serves
 merchants
 and
 small


businesses.
 So
 it's
 not
 only,
 you
 know,


just
 consumers
 trading
 but
 or
 or
 or


sending
 money
 to
 each
 other.
 that
 in
 in


and
 of
 itself
 maybe
 these
 companies
 are


not
 really
 embracing
 that
 overall


ecosystem
 especially
 through
 stable


coins
 and
 that
 could
 be
 creating
 some


issues.
 Yeah,
 Zel
 is
 getting
 ready
 to


introduce
 international
 payments
 and


stable
 coins.
 SoFi
 has
 stable
 coins.
 So


you
 got
 a
 lot
 I
 mean
 dude,
 Western


Union,
 did
 you
 guys
 see
 this
 at
 Western


Union,
 shout
 out
 to
 Douggee,
 he
 was


talking
 about
 this
 a
 month
 ago.
 Western


Union
 is
 introducing
 stable
 coins
 as
 a


payment
 mechanism,
 which
 makes
 sense


because
 Western
 Union,
 you
 know,
 use
 it


to
 send
 money.
 You
 might
 as
 well
 have


stable
 coins
 be
 part
 of
 that.


I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies
 are


going
 to
 have
 to
 adapt
 uh
 in
 order
 to


change
 their
 narrative
 and
 Fiser
 might


have
 not
 might
 have
 not
 officially


adapted
 to
 this
 right
 now.


And
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 Amazon
 again


moving
 higher
 on
 that
 anthropic
 news,


but
 that
 also
 the
 South
 Korea
 $5
 billion


data
 center
 investment.
 The
 anthropic


news
 did
 come
 out
 an
 hour
 ago.
 So
 I


think
 the
 stock
 is
 more
 so
 pumping
 on


the
 South
 Korean
 news.
 But
 those
 two


together,
 Anthropic
 tightening
 their


relationship
 with
 Amazon
 and
 Google


based
 on
 the
 million
 TPUs
 that
 they're


buying.
 Uh
 and
 then
 this
 South
 Korea
 $5


billion
 data
 center
 investment.
 Those


two
 are
 putting
 together
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move


right
 here
 on
 Amazon.
 All right,
 Nvidia.


Let's
 talk
 about
 Nvidia.
 What
 the
 heck


happened
 with
 Nvidia
 yesterday?
 Well,


you
 had
 Jensen
 basically
 say
 that


everything
 is
 going
 really
 well.
 And
 not


just
 everything
 is
 going
 really
 well.
 He


increased
 guidance
 by
 500
 billion
 a
 not


increase
 literally
 by
 500
 billion,
 but


he
 said
 there's
 a
 $500
 billion


opportunity
 for
 Nvidia
 over
 the
 next


five
 quarters.
 Now,
 this
 really
 matters


because
 the
 street
 thought
 there
 was


only
 a
 $380
 billion
 opportunity
 and
 as
 a


result,
 you
 know,
 it's
 $120
 billion
 more


than
 expected.
 The
 street
 has
 to


increase
 their
 earnings
 estimates.


Originally,
 it
 was
 reported
 that
 it
 was


only
 for
 six
 quarters
 and
 then
 Jensen


clarified,
 no,
 it's
 for
 five
 quarters.


And
 the
 reason
 he
 said
 this
 is
 because


he
 gave
 an
 update
 on
 how
 many
 Blackwell


and
 Ruben
 GPUs
 are
 to
 be
 shipped.
 He


said
 20
 million
 will
 be
 shipped.
 They've


already
 done
 six
 million.
 They
 said
 the


Blackwell
 projections
 don't
 include


China.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 they
 see
 that


$500
 billion
 update
 over
 the
 next
 five


quarters,
 which
 got
 the
 streets
 to


think,
 "Wait
 a
 second,
 this
 is
 cheap."


Like
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 been
 saying,


including
 Tanner
 and
 Steve,
 that
 Nvidia


is
 cheap.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 their
 earnings


projections,
 but
 what
 Jensen
 said


yesterday
 solidified


that
 Nvidia
 is
 cheap.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


that's
 why
 you're
 seeing
 the
 move
 that


we're
 seeing
 right
 now.
 By
 the
 way,
 AS,


this
 one
 is
 moving
 as
 well.
 That's
 up


4%.
 ASTS
 announces
 signing
 of
 10-year


strategic
 partnership
 agreement
 to


provide
 space-based
 telecom
 services


with
 AS
 Mobile
 in
 Saudi.


So
 AS
 and
 Saudi
 Telecom
 have
 partnered,


that's
 a
 10-year
 strategic
 partnership.


No
 numbers
 exactly
 on
 what
 that
 deal


looks
 like,
 but
 there
 you
 go.
 This
 is


coming
 off
 of
 another
 announcement
 that


AS
 made
 two
 weeks
 ago.
 That's
 when
 they


gapped
 up
 to
 102.
 Then
 they
 took
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 breather,
 which
 was


normal
 after
 that
 big
 of
 a
 move.
 But


that
 stock
 up
 4%
 now
 in
 the
 pre-markets


on
 a
 new
 partnership
 with
 Saudi
 Arabia.


There
 you
 go.
 AS
 moving,
 Fubo
 moving,


and
 Amazon
 moving
 here
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 Okay.
 So
 then
 what
 did


Trump
 say
 last
 night
 that
 really
 got
 the


street
 excited
 about
 Nvidia?
 Well,
 he


said
 Jensen
 showed
 me
 the
 Blackwell
 chip


in
 the
 Oval
 Office,


number
 one.
 Uh
 and
 then
 he
 said
 that
 uh


I
 will
 be
 talking
 to
 Xi
 about
 the
 black


belt.
 So
 now
 investors
 last
 night
 were


like
 wait
 a
 second
 not
 only
 is
 Nvidia


giving
 us
 increased
 earnings
 updates
 and


essentially
 increased
 guidance
 but
 now


they're
 telling
 us
 or
 but
 now
 Trump's


telling
 us
 that
 he's
 going
 to
 try
 to


work
 out
 a
 deal
 essentially
 he's


implying
 it
 with
 Xi
 about
 Blackwell.
 And


the
 reason
 he's
 saying
 this
 is
 because


he's
 kind
 of
 giving
 a
 signal
 to
 the


Chinese
 that
 are
 probably
 listening
 to


his
 comments
 of
 hey
 I
 am
 ready
 to
 talk


about
 Nvidia.
 I'm
 ready
 to
 talk
 about


AMD.
 I
 am
 ready
 to
 talk
 about
 you
 guys


having
 access
 to
 all
 of
 our
 AI


infrastructure,
 but
 you
 guys
 need
 to


give
 me
 some
 cooperation
 on
 rare
 earth


metals,
 soybeans,
 etc.
 And
 then
 what
 do


we
 get
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 in
 China
 says,


"Hey,
 we're
 buying
 180,000
 tons
 of


soybeans,
 which
 again,
 I
 mean,
 that
 that


to
 me
 is
 a
 pretty
 good
 show
 of
 faith


given
 the
 fact
 that
 they
 haven't
 bought


soybeans
 in
 8
 months.


And
 so
 it
 just
 seems
 like
 everything's


going
 in
 a
 particular
 direction
 for


Nvidia
 that
 is
 more
 positive
 than
 not


because
 of
 China
 cooperation
 than


because
 of
 all
 the
 partnerships
 that


they
 put
 out
 as
 well.
 And
 that's
 why


you're
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 excitement
 right


there
 for
 Nvidia


in
 the
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 Uh
 CleanSpark


also
 moving
 right
 here
 as
 well.
 Clean


Spark
 that's
 up
 5%.
 CleanSpark
 enters


Texas
 with
 285
 megawatts
 of
 power
 and


271
 acres
 of
 AI
 data
 center
 deployment.


Uh,
 the
 acquisition
 of
 this
 land


increases
 the
 company's
 power
 under


contract
 by
 28%.
 The
 Austin
 County
 site


sits
 between
 Houston
 and
 Austin
 on
 a


major
 fiber
 backbone.
 Looks
 like


CleanSpark
 has
 acquired
 some
 more
 land


to
 be
 able
 to
 keep
 building
 their
 data


centers
 and
 an
 AI
 campus,
 271
 acres
 in


the
 great
 state
 of
 Texas.


And
 there
 you
 go.
 Clean
 Spark
 is
 green.


Dude,
 the
 headlines
 are
 coming
 like


crazy
 on
 a
 bunch
 of
 these
 AI
 names,
 but


there
 you
 go.
 CleanSpark
 up
 5%
 as
 well.


on
 this
 new
 data
 center
 announcement.
 Uh


some
 audio
 of
 what
 Trump
 said
 yesterday.


So,
 let
 me
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.


Let's
 get
 a
 couple
 of
 clips.
 First
 of


all,
 this
 was
 Trump
 when
 in
 uh
 Korea
 and


uh
 talking
 to
 the
 people
 of
 Korea
 as
 he


was
 at
 the
 summit.


>> The
 Republic
 of
 Korea
 is
 a
 cherished


American
 friend
 and
 a
 close
 ally.
 And
 as


we
 can
 see
 in
 this
 beautiful
 city,
 it's


truly
 one
 of
 the
 most
 remarkable
 nations


anywhere
 on
 earth
 here
 in
 this


peninsula,
 the
 people
 of
 South
 Korea


have
 forged
 a
 miracle
 of
 economic


development
 like
 you
 rarely
 see.
 An


industrial
 and
 technological
 powerhouse


and
 above
 all
 a
 free
 society
 and


enduring
 democracy
 and
 a
 thriving


civilization.
 And
 I
 want
 to
 congratulate


you.
 Very
 few
 places
 like
 it.
 The
 entire


world
 should
 be
 inspired
 by
 all
 that
 you


have
 achieved
 and
 they
 study
 you
 and


they
 do
 so
 much
 to
 understand
 what


you've
 done
 but
 most
 of
 them
 don't
 get


it
 and
 it's
 probably
 good
 for
 you.
 Keep


it
 this
 way.
 The


and
 then
 after
 that
 Trump
 tweeted
 for


those
 that
 are
 asking
 we
 didn't
 come
 to


South
 Korea
 to
 see
 Canada.
 So
 continuing


to
 throw
 shade
 at
 the
 Canadians
 right


here.
 uh
 but
 basically
 making
 the


argument
 that
 hey
 South
 Korea
 is
 strong,


the
 United
 States
 is
 strong
 with
 our


partnership
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 continue


working
 on
 that
 partnership.
 So
 you
 had


a
 lot
 of
 other
 formalities
 done
 in
 South


Korea.
 They
 presented
 him
 with
 a
 bunch


of
 different
 things
 that
 are
 culturally


relevant
 to
 the
 nation.
 And
 like
 overall


it
 just
 seems
 like
 the
 relationship
 that


he
 ca
 he
 created
 uh
 or
 he
 continued
 to


instill
 with
 South
 Korea
 was
 very


bullish.
 And
 not
 only
 that,
 it
 seems


like
 this
 is
 the
 way
 you
 want
 to
 have


diplomacy
 as
 you
 get
 ready
 to
 be
 China.


Right.
 If
 if
 I
 mean
 if
 Trump
 Trump


already
 had
 a
 really
 good
 meeting
 in


Japan
 and
 that
 resulted
 in
 the
 Japanese


prime
 minister
 who's
 a
 new
 prime


minister
 getting
 to
 actually
 understand


who
 Trump
 is,
 getting
 to
 know
 who
 h
 how


he
 operates,
 getting
 to
 potentially
 buy


some
 of
 the
 stuff
 that
 the
 the
 Japanese


have
 already
 bought
 from
 the
 United


States.
 Now
 South
 Korea,
 remember
 Japan


already
 has
 a
 $550
 billion
 investment


that
 they
 agreed
 to
 under
 the
 previous


prime
 minister
 and
 Howard
 Lutnik


confirmed
 yesterday
 that
 they
 would
 be


still
 investing
 that
 500
 billion


especially
 in
 AI
 which
 is
 bullish
 Nvidia


as
 well.
 Then
 you've
 got
 South
 Korea


being
 friendly
 with
 Trump.
 And
 now
 if
 he


can
 just
 complete
 the
 trifecta
 with


getting
 China
 on
 board
 and
 this
 soybean


announcement
 this
 morning
 really
 does


feel
 like
 it's
 not
 in
 the
 worst


situation,
 then
 I
 think
 all
 signs
 point


to
 a
 broader
 based
 rally
 as
 the
 market


prices
 in
 some
 better
 geopolitical
 uh


stability.
 Yeah,
 Japan's
 up
 over
 5%
 this


week.
 I
 mean
 the
 Nikk
 crossed
 51,000


last
 night.
 This
 is
 incredible.
 So
 it's


not
 just
 the
 United
 States
 benefiting


from
 this.
 It's
 obviously
 Japanese


investors
 saying
 we
 are
 ready
 to
 buy
 the


index
 of
 our
 own
 country
 if
 we
 think
 we


have
 more
 diplomatic
 ties
 with
 the


United
 States
 and
 we're
 more
 strategic


and
 as
 a
 result
 you're
 getting
 some


green.
 So
 again
 whether
 you
 love
 Trump


or
 hate
 Trump
 I'm
 I'm
 I
 care
 about
 the


stock
 market
 and
 I
 care
 about
 kind
 of


what
 he's
 doing
 across
 the
 world
 to


create
 better
 relationships
 to
 help
 not


only
 the
 stock
 market
 but
 the
 economy


and
 as
 a
 function
 of
 that
 it
 would
 help


the
 stock
 market.
 Year
 to
 date
 is
 up
 30%


S&P's
 up
 about
 19%.
 And
 it
 looks
 like
 so


far
 we've
 had
 some
 decent
 meetings
 in


this
 Asia
 trip.
 And
 if
 we
 can
 get
 a
 good


China
 deal,
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 the


markets
 are
 really
 giving
 Nvidia
 the


premium
 right
 here
 at
 208.15.


Nvidia
 is
 above
 5
 trillion.
 By
 the
 way,


I
 think
 the
 number
 was
 205.3.
 So
 once
 it


opens,
 it'll
 officially
 be
 above
 5


trillion,
 but
 we
 are
 there.


And
 you
 see
 Nvidia
 getting
 some
 love


right
 now
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 So
 that's


sort
 of
 the
 main
 things
 we
 have
 on


Nvidia.
 There's
 a
 couple
 other
 things


that
 happened
 yesterday
 with
 Jensen
 that


we'll
 talk
 about
 later,
 but
 overall


pretty
 bullish
 across
 the
 board
 and
 the


street
 seems
 to
 be
 liking
 this


um
 liking
 this
 as
 well.
 Now,
 let's


transition
 into
 some
 of
 the
 other
 stuff


that
 we
 have
 headlines.
 First,
 let's
 do


earnings
 and
 then
 we'll
 get
 into
 all
 the


other
 things.
 We
 got
 some
 macro
 news
 and


we
 have
 some
 layoff
 news
 that
 I
 think
 is


worth
 talking
 about,
 but
 let's
 get
 into


earnings.
 Uh
 again,
 companies
 are


continuing
 to
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the


bottom
 line.
 This
 morning
 we've
 had
 a


little
 bit
 less
 of
 that,
 but
 overall


even
 yesterday
 if
 you
 were
 on
 for
 the


market
 close,
 we
 saw
 more
 and
 more
 beats


on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom
 line.
 Etsy


beat
 by
 21%


on
 EPS,
 beat
 by
 3%
 on
 revenues.
 So
 Etsy,


their
 stock
 right
 now
 is
 down
 about
 9%.


Probably
 something
 they
 said
 in
 guidance


or
 something
 the
 street
 didn't
 like
 on


the
 call,
 but
 as
 a
 broad-based
 investor


just
 looking
 at,
 hey,
 are
 these


companies
 beating
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the


bottom?
 We
 are
 seeing
 consistent


double-digit
 beats
 for
 these
 earnings.


and
 Etsy,
 another
 consumer
 company,


showing
 that
 they're
 able
 to
 do
 that.


Caterpillar,
 another
 very
 important


company,
 beat
 by
 10%
 on
 EPS,
 beat
 by
 5%


on
 revenue.
 495
 versus
 452.
 EPS
 is
 down


4%
 year-over-year.
 Revenue
 is
 up
 10%


year-over-year.
 17.6
 versus
 16.7


billion.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 thinking


Caterpillar
 might
 play
 a
 broader
 role
 in


data
 centers
 as
 they
 provide
 a
 lot
 of


machinery
 for
 those
 institutions.
 Look


at
 that.
 Caterpillar
 right
 there
 up


5.82%


in
 the
 pre-markets
 on
 another
 beat
 on


the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 Etsy
 CEO


stepping
 down.
 Okay,
 cool.
 That's


exactly
 what
 happened
 with
 Amcor
 and


then
 Amcor
 recovered
 most
 of
 its
 losses


yesterday.
 So,
 usually
 again
 when
 these


CEOs
 step
 down,
 you
 tend
 to
 get
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 knee-jerk
 reaction
 on
 the


sell-off
 for
 most
 of these
 stocks.
 CVS,


another
 consumer
 company,
 beat
 on
 the


top
 and
 the
 bottom
 18%
 on
 EPS.
 I
 mean,


these
 are
 EPS
 that
 are
 ranging
 from
 15


to
 30%.
 It
 is
 quite
 phenomenal.
 And
 if


we're
 seeing
 this
 on
 CBS
 or
 Etsy,
 I


imagine
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 on
 Meta,


Microsoft,
 and
 Google.
 And
 if
 we
 get


anywhere
 near
 double
 digit
 EPS,


I
 mean,
 again,
 this
 could
 just
 be
 a


very,
 very
 strong
 earning
 cycle.
 And


today,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 those


numbers.
 160
 versus
 136
 and
 then
 102.8


billion
 versus
 98
 billion
 for
 CBS.
 That


stock
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 is
 up
 3.43%.


Then
 you
 had
 Verizon,
 which
 beat
 by
 2%


on
 EPS.
 Very
 good
 for
 the
 beat.
 And
 then


it
 was
 a
 very
 small
 miss
 on
 revenue
 by


1%.
 So
 even
 though
 they
 had
 a
 miss
 on


revenue,
 they
 beat
 by
 2%.
 That
 stock
 is


up
 3%
 as
 well
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 And


Verizon
 continuing
 to
 go
 green.


People
 are
 saying
 BMR
 is
 reporting


today.
 I
 heard
 uh
 BMR's
 reporting
 on


November
 5th.
 I
 don't
 see
 it
 on
 their


website
 either,
 so
 I
 don't
 have
 the


exact
 result,
 but
 again,
 I
 don't
 think


BMR
 reporting
 is
 that
 relevant
 because


we
 already
 know
 like
 that
 how
 much
 ETH


they
 have.
 We
 compare
 it
 to
 the
 market


cap.
 You
 creme
 up
 with
 an
 MNAP.
 I
 I


guess
 if
 we
 get
 their
 8K,
 we
 can
 get
 the


official
 of
 fully
 diluted
 shares


outstanding,
 which
 is
 important.
 But
 I


don't
 even
 know
 if
 they're
 going to
 do
 a


call
 or
 if
 Tomley's
 remember
 Tomley
 is


not
 the
 CEO.
 So
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 there's


going to
 be
 there's
 no
 earnings
 pump
 to


have
 unless
 Ethereum
 pumps.
 So
 for


Bitmine,
 it's
 kind
 of
 just
 like
 it's
 a


wait
 and
 see
 and
 uh
 it's
 more
 so


tracking
 Ethereum.
 But
 I
 do
 think
 the


earnings
 are
 next
 week,
 not
 today,
 but


we'll
 keep
 an
 eye on
 eye
 on
 it
 if
 we
 do


have
 it
 today.
 SMCI,
 we're
 moving
 on


SMCI.
 Why
 are
 we
 moving
 on
 SMCI
 5462?


This
 one
 fully
 recovering
 from
 the
 4795


drop
 that
 it
 took
 last
 week.
 Super
 Micro


announces
 US
 federal
 entity
 to
 expand


further
 into
 the
 federal
 market.


Extensive
 US-based
 manufacturing
 of
 AI


server
 portfolio
 targets
 the
 federal


ecosystem.


Okay.
 So,
 looks
 like
 Super
 Micro
 is


announcing
 a
 push
 into
 the
 federal


markets.
 I
 don't
 know
 exactly
 what
 that


means.


They
 build
 AI
 servers.
 They're
 saying,


okay,
 let's
 read
 this.
 They
 accelerate


expansion
 into
 the
 federal
 US
 market.


The
 subsidiary
 will
 deliver
 AI
 ready


high
 performance
 and
 energy
 efficient


data
 center
 IT
 solutions
 that
 are


developed,
 manufactured,
 validated
 and


tested
 in
 the
 USA.
 The
 effort
 emphasizes


domestic
 engineering
 faster
 time
 to


market
 for
 federal
 deployment
 potential


US
 manufacturing
 facilities
 and
 a
 focus


on
 supplying
 government
 agencies
 with


full
 stack
 data
 center
 building
 block


solutions.
 Okay.
 It
 seems
 like
 what


they're
 saying
 is
 that
 whatever
 data


centers
 that
 the
 government
 is


essentially
 going
 to
 need
 and
 you
 know


the
 government's
 going
 to
 need
 a
 variety


of
 IT
 solutions
 for
 different
 data


centers
 in
 federal
 agencies.
 This
 goes


back
 to
 the
 whole
 sovereign
 AI
 concept


that
 Jensen
 was
 talking
 about.
 I
 mean,


it
 seems
 like
 SMCI
 just
 put
 out
 a
 press


release
 that
 says
 we're
 going
 to
 try
 to


build
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 server
 racks
 in
 the


United
 States
 via
 this
 new
 subsidiary,


which
 obviously
 has
 to
 be
 music
 to


Trump's
 ears
 because
 he
 wants
 more


American
 manufacturing.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 and


Jensen
 talked
 about
 that
 a
 lot


yesterday.
 Jensen
 talked
 a
 lot
 about
 the


idea
 of
 bringing
 back
 American


manufacturing
 to
 the
 United
 States.


That's
 bullish
 Amcore,
 bullish
 Broadcom,


bullish
 Nvidia,
 bullish
 AMD,
 SMCI,
 etc.


any
 of
 the
 companies
 that
 lean
 into
 that


probably
 are
 going
 to
 be
 on
 the
 right


side
 of
 the
 administration
 in
 terms
 of


what
 they're
 trying
 to
 do
 with
 these


semiconductors.
 They
 need
 to
 be
 built
 in


the
 USA
 for
 security.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 mean


that's
 the
 the
 broader
 point
 that
 Jensen


and
 Trump
 have
 been
 trying
 to
 make
 over


the
 past
 couple
 of
 months.
 So
 there
 you


go.
 SMCI
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 pop
 right


there.
 Apple
 that's
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 as


well.
 Apple
 basically
 at
 all
 time
 highs


at
 26932.
 Tesla
 got
 a
 big
 move
 yesterday


464.
 You
 got
 some
 upgrades
 on
 the
 street


even
 after
 their
 earnings
 and
 I
 mean
 the


street's
 getting
 more
 excited.
 46450


right
 on
 Tesla.
 488
 is
 the
 all-time


high.
 It
 would
 be
 quite
 incredible
 to


break
 through
 that
 but
 we
 are
 holding


the
 460s
 right
 there.
 AMD
 at
 262
 also


basically
 at
 all
 time
 highs.
 Uh
 and
 then


you
 got
 Palanteer
 right
 here
 at
 191.


Nvidia


still
 at
 208


on
 the
 day.
 So
 that's
 what
 we
 have
 in


the
 context
 of
 earnings.
 Again,
 the
 only


really
 crappy
 earnings
 today
 was
 F
 was


Ferve
 and
 that
 just,
 you
 know,
 wasn't


the
 best
 for
 them.
 But
 outside
 of
 that,


you
 pretty
 much
 had
 some
 decent
 results.


The
 other
 company
 that
 we
 had
 was


Boeing.
 Now,
 Boeing,
 this
 was
 also
 a


pretty
 bad
 miss,
 but
 I
 think
 this
 is


more
 of
 an
 accounting
 thing.
 They
 missed


by
 214%
 on
 EPS,
 beat
 by
 5%
 on
 revenue.


Boeing
 has
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 different


accounting
 and
 financial
 engineering


issues
 over
 the
 past
 two
 years.
 Boeing


stock
 is
 flat.
 Yeah,
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


like
 a
 real
 200%
 miss.
 and
 more
 so
 has


to
 do
 probably
 with
 goodwill
 impairment


charges
 and
 taxes
 etc
 along
 with


government
 shutdown
 which
 we
 still
 do


have
 a
 government
 shutdown
 so
 Boeing
 is


a
 very
 big
 government
 contractor
 but
 you


uh
 you
 do
 have
 Boeing
 that's
 basically


flat
 in
 the
 premarkets
 Ethereum
 and


Bitcoin
 where
 are
 these
 guys
 ETH
 is
 at


427
 are
 back
 above
 4,000
 we
 went
 below


4,000
 yesterday
 and
 then
 Bitcoin
 fell


all
 the
 way
 to
 112
 it's
 a
 little
 bit


above
 113
 again
 Bitcoin
 and
 ETH
 have


been
 quite
 a
 disappointment
 over
 the


past
 month,
 but
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.


They're
 still
 up
 for
 the
 year.
 And
 I


know
 everyone
 wanted
 a
 massive
 October.


Maybe
 we
 still
 will
 have
 an
 October,
 but


maybe
 we
 need
 the
 rate
 cuts
 today
 to


really
 solidify
 some
 of
 that.
 It
 is
 kind


of
 weird
 though
 because
 gold
 is
 up.
 Wow,


gold
 actually
 making
 a
 move
 today.
 Oh,


that's
 not
 good
 for
 a
 crypto.
 But
 gold,


look
 at
 that.
 Gold
 back
 above
 4,000,
 up


1.3%.
 Silver
 up
 2.3%.
 You
 would
 think


when
 the
 rotation
 happened
 in
 gold
 and


it
 lost
 4,400,
 maybe
 some
 of
 that
 money


would
 come
 into
 crypto.
 And
 really,
 you


didn't
 see
 that.
 you
 just
 didn't
 see


that
 happen.


>> So,
 I
 think
 we're
 going to
 have
 to
 see


these
 rate
 cuts
 and
 the
 potential
 impact


of
 the
 rate
 cuts
 on
 crypto,
 but
 as
 of


now,
 those
 assets
 have
 been
 relatively


stagnant


throughout
 the
 entire
 month.


Uh,
 Fubo,
 is
 that
 one
 still
 moving?


Probably
 up
 20%.
 Fubo
 up
 20.8%
 440.
 Then


you
 got
 Nvidia
 right
 here
 still
 up
 3.4.


AMD
 up
 1.6.
 SoFi.
 All right.
 So,
 SoFi


had
 a
 great
 earnings
 yesterday.
 They
 got


a
 bunch
 of
 different
 targets.
 City
 Bank


increased
 them
 to
 $28.
 Jeffre
 increased


them
 to
 $35.
 Stock's
 red
 right
 here,
 but


it's
 red
 at
 31,
 which
 I
 think
 everyone's


happy
 about
 that
 at
 least
 it's
 at
 31
 and


not
 below
 30
 like
 it
 was
 yesterday.
 Uh
 I


don't
 know
 how
 this
 stock
 reacts
 today.


I
 think
 we
 got
 to
 get
 the
 rate
 cut
 to


solidify
 the
 refinancing
 demand
 that
 a


lot
 of
 people
 are
 projecting
 for
 SoFi.


But
 I
 also
 think
 just
 generally
 for
 the


market,
 everyone
 know
 I
 mean
 there's
 a


97%
 chance
 we're
 going to
 get
 a
 rate


cut.
 Some
 of
 this
 stuff
 might
 be
 priced


in
 to
 an
 extent.
 Never
 mind,
 it's
 99.9%.


getting
 JPAL
 to
 actually
 do
 it
 obviously


would
 be,
 you
 know,
 something
 that


people
 want
 to
 see
 happen,
 but
 it's
 also


just
 a
 question
 of,
 hey,
 how
 much
 of
 the


actual


um
 rate
 cuts
 are
 we
 actually
 going
 to


see
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 impact
 of
 how
 these


stocks
 are
 affected?
 And
 that's


something
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 look
 at


throughout
 the
 entire
 day.
 2
 p.m.


Eastern,
 we're
 going to
 get
 the
 FOMC


meeting
 or
 the
 announcement.
 And
 then


2:30,
 we'll
 be
 live
 for
 JPAL.
 Okay.
 So,


let's
 uh
 well,
 let's
 do
 this
 real
 quick


and
 then
 we'll
 talk
 about
 the
 layoffs.


So,
 Poucher
 and
 uh
 Nvidia,
 they
 also
 had


a
 big
 announcement
 yesterday.
 For
 those


that
 haven't
 seen
 it,
 this
 is
 the
 one


minute
 clip.
 Uh
 this
 is
 the
 clip
 that


got
 me
 to
 have
 a
 well,
 just
 let's
 just


call
 it
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 reaction
 yesterday


when
 this
 when
 this
 finally
 happened.


This
 is
 Jensen
 announcing
 the


partnership
 with
 Paler.


This
 is
 the
 single
 fastest
 enterprise


enterprise
 company
 in
 the
 world.


probably
 the
 single
 most
 important


enterprise
 stack
 in
 the
 world
 today.


Palunteer
 ontology.


Anybody
 from
 Palunteer
 here?
 I
 just
 I


was
 just
 talking
 to
 Alex
 earlier.


This
 is
 Palenter
 ontology.
 They
 take


information,


they
 take
 data,
 they
 take
 human
 judgment


and
 they
 turn
 it
 into
 business
 insight.


We
 work
 with
 Palanteer
 to
 accelerate


everything
 Palanteer
 does
 so
 that
 we


could
 do
 data
 processing
 data
 processing


at
 a
 much
 much
 larger
 scale
 and
 more


speed
 whether
 it's
 structured
 data
 of


the
 past
 and
 of
 course
 we'll
 have


structured
 data
 human
 recorded
 data


unstructured
 data
 and
 process
 that
 data


for
 our
 government
 for
 national
 security


and
 for
 enterprises
 around
 the
 world


process
 that
 data
 at
 speed
 of
 light
 and


to
 find
 insight
 from
 it.
 This
 is
 what


it's
 going
 to
 look
 like
 in
 the
 future.


Palunteer
 is
 going
 to
 integrate
 Nvidia


so
 that
 we
 could
 process
 at
 the
 speed
 of


light
 and
 at
 extraordinary
 scale.


Okay,
 Nvidia
 and
 Palanteer.


Look,
 that
 was
 a
 big
 deal.
 A
 lot
 of
 us


in
 the
 Paler
 community
 have
 been
 waiting


for
 that.
 Uh
 Jensen,
 you
 know,
 really
 he


did
 an
 interview
 with
 Karp
 after
 and


talked
 about
 how
 important
 the
 uh
 the


partnership
 was
 with
 Palanteers.
 It
 was


nice
 to
 finally
 see
 that
 happen
 and


given
 that
 that
 did
 happen,
 you
 know,


you
 got
 a
 lot
 more
 people
 thinking
 of


pounder
 in
 a
 much
 more
 serious
 way
 given


Jensen
 officially
 said
 that
 this
 is
 the


most
 important
 software
 stack
 on
 the


planet.
 Let
 me
 show
 you
 guys
 one
 more


video
 of
 Jensen
 and
 then
 we're
 going
 to


get
 into
 a
 lot
 of the
 macro
 stuff


because
 we
 did
 have
 some
 very


interesting
 macro
 things
 happen


yesterday
 in
 regards
 to
 the
 S&P
 500


hitting
 all-time
 highs,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 the


companies
 in
 the
 S&P
 500
 not
 really


participating.
 So,
 we'll
 talk
 about


that.
 Here
 is
 Jensen
 yesterday
 about
 why


we
 are
 not
 in
 an
 AI
 bubble.


>> I
 don't
 believe
 we're
 in
 an
 AI
 bubble.


And
 the
 reason
 for
 that
 is
 we're
 going


through
 a
 natural
 transition
 from
 a
 old


computing
 model
 based
 on
 general
 purpose


computing
 to
 accelerated
 computing.
 We


also
 know
 that
 AI
 has
 now
 become
 good


enough
 because
 of
 reasoning


capabilities,
 research
 capabilities,
 its


ability
 to
 think.
 It's
 now
 generating


tokens
 and
 now
 generating
 intelligence


that's
 worth
 paying
 for
 to
 the
 point


where
 I'm
 paying
 lots
 of
 it.
 Cursor
 is


all
 over
 Nvidia.
 Every
 single
 one
 of
 our


engineers
 use
 it.
 We
 pay
 lots
 and
 lots


of
 money
 for
 it.
 We're
 delighted
 to
 do


it
 and
 cursor
 is
 just
 one
 of
 the


applications
 you
 know


uh
 um
 what
 is
 it
 uh
 uh
 11
 11
 tech
 uh
 I


forget
 but
 anyways
 um
 all
 of
 these


different
 AI
 models
 that
 we're
 using


we're
 we're
 using
 plenty
 of
 services
 and


pay
 paying
 uh
 happily
 doing
 it.
 I
 don't


believe
 we're
 in
 an
 AI
 bubble.
 And
 the


reason
 for
 that
 is,


>> all
 right,
 so
 you
 got
 Jensen
 obviously


thinking
 we're
 not
 in
 an
 AI
 bubble.
 But


the
 reason
 he
 also
 thinks
 we're
 not
 in


an
 AI
 bubble
 is
 because,
 you
 know,
 there


is
 a
 transformation
 that
 is
 happening


right
 here.
 And
 that
 transformation
 is


real.
 And
 because,
 you
 know,
 it's
 real


and
 because
 you're
 obviously
 seeing
 a


lot
 of
 uh
 lot
 of
 companies
 that
 are


starting
 to
 monetize
 and
 get
 that
 ROI,


you
 know,
 that's
 his
 argument
 for
 why
 we


are
 likely
 not
 the
 AI
 bubble.
 Yeah,
 he


meant
 to
 say
 11
 Labs.
 You
 know
 I


actually
 used
 11
 labs
 like
 two
 years


ago.
 I
 remember
 discovering
 them
 for
 the


first
 time.
 They
 basically
 like
 create


custom
 um
 voices
 for
 people
 and
 you
 know


at
 that
 time
 AI
 was
 so
 new
 and
 all
 these


applications
 were
 so
 new
 but
 these


companies
 have
 just
 grown
 to
 such
 an


extent
 and
 it
 is
 quite
 incredible
 to
 see


how
 they
 played
 out.
 So
 there
 you
 go.
 If


you
 own
 Nvidia
 congratulations.
 I
 mean


this
 is
 absolutely
 incredible.
 Uh
 my


sister
 owns
 Nvidia.
 I
 texted
 her
 last


night.
 She
 owns
 1500
 shares.
 I
 bought


for
 her
 at
 $139.
 So,
 she's
 up
 basically


95
 grand
 on
 uh
 on
 Nvidia.
 And
 I
 texted


her
 cuz
 she
 doesn't
 really
 open
 her


Robin
 Hood.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Hey,
 you're


up
 95
 grand."
 Like,
 I
 give
 her
 a


screenshot.
 I
 was
 like, "Look,
 you're


you're
 up
 95
 grand."
 And
 this
 was
 her


response.


Wow.


Dude,
 she
 did
 like
 you
 would
 think


someone
 is
 up
 a
 hundred
 grand
 and
 like


they
 would
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 excited.


They
 would
 be
 like, "Wow,
 that's


amazing."
 Like,
 why?
 Like,
 you
 know,
 I


would
 if
 someone
 said,
 "Hey,
 Emit,


you're
 up
 $100,000."
 I
 would
 want
 to


know
 like
 why.
 What
 happened
 today
 that


caused
 this
 type
 of
 move
 for
 for
 me
 to


increase
 my
 net
 worth
 by
 hundred
 grand?


No.
 She
 like,
 "No,
 it's
 it's
 I
 don't


care."
 You
 know,
 honestly,
 if
 anyone


like
 if
 anyone
 if
 anyone
 professionally


managed
 her
 money,
 she
 is
 the
 best


client
 ever.
 She
 does
 not
 care.
 Like,


she
 doesn't
 give
 a
 [ __ ]
 bro.
 She


doesn't
 care.
 She
 wants
 to
 see
 the


number
 go
 up,
 but
 that's
 it.


That's
 it.
 She
 will
 not
 ask
 any


questions
 ever.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 actually
 a


pretty
 it's
 actually
 very
 healthy
 to


just
 manage
 her
 money
 and
 do
 whatever.


She
 doesn't
 care
 what
 I
 do.
 I
 could
 do


this.
 I
 could
 do
 that.
 She
 doesn't
 care.


As
 long
 as
 it's
 going
 up
 into
 the
 right


over
 the
 long
 term,
 she's
 fine.
 All


right.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 macro.
 Let's


talk
 about
 macro.
 So,
 I
 have
 three
 macro


stats
 to
 share
 with
 everybody.
 And
 I


think
 these
 macro
 stats
 are going
 to
 be


really
 important.
 But
 let's
 take
 a
 look


at
 what
 we
 got
 going
 on.
 First
 of
 all,


this
 stat,
 which
 was
 pretty
 incredible.


398


of
 the
 S&P
 500
 names,
 there's
 only
 500


of
 them.
 So,
 you're
 talking
 about
 almost


400
 names
 out
 of
 the
 S&P
 500
 were
 read


on
 the
 day,
 which
 was
 pretty
 incredible.


So,
 today's
 S&P
 500
 alltime
 high,
 which


was
 yesterday,
 uh,
 is
 going
 to
 make


history
 books
 as
 per
 Goldman
 Sachs
 is


the
 chart
 from
 Goldman
 because
 it
 says


it
 will
 happen
 with
 the
 most
 negative


market
 breath
 at
 an
 all-time
 high
 on


record.
 I
 don't
 fully
 know
 if
 this
 is


bullish
 or
 bearish.


gut
 tells
 me
 it's
 a
 bit
 bearish
 to
 see


that
 much
 divergence
 between
 like
 four


or
 five
 companies,
 Nvidia
 being
 the
 big


one
 today,
 uh,
 or
 yesterday,
 and


everything
 else
 going
 red.
 I
 mean,
 we


have
 not
 seen
 that
 in
 a
 long
 time.
 I


don't
 know
 the
 exact
 date
 where
 we've


seen
 that
 much
 of
 a
 divergence,
 but


you're
 talking
 about
 400
 companies
 red


and
 a
 hundred
 of
 them
 green,
 a
 lot
 of


them
 relatively
 flat,
 and
 seven
 or
 eight


of
 them,
 including
 Nvidia,
 really
 green.


So,
 it
 is
 weird
 that
 the
 entire
 market


didn't
 rally
 with
 this.
 Although
 the
 S&P


500
 did,
 but
 it
 also
 goes
 to
 show
 you


how
 topheavy
 Nvidia
 is.
 Again,
 Nvidia
 is


8%
 of
 the
 S&P
 500.
 It
 has
 moved
 up,
 if


I'm
 not
 wrong,


uh,
 well,
 let's
 just
 do
 the
 math
 real


quick.
 Yesterday,
 it
 was
 up,
 let's
 do


the
 math.
 Yeah,
 about
 $435
 billion.
 $435


billion
 in
 the
 past,
 not
 even
 in
 24


hours,
 less
 than
 24.
 So
 when
 you
 have


that
 level
 of
 market
 cap
 entering
 into


one
 company
 that's
 8%
 of
 the
 S&P
 500
 and


then
 you
 got
 Apple
 hitting
 all-time


highs,
 you're
 obviously
 going
 to
 have


some
 breath
 issues.
 So
 I
 think
 that's


one
 thing
 we
 have
 to
 keep
 an
 eye
 on


because
 you
 you
 want
 to
 see
 more
 and


more
 companies
 participate,
 not
 just


Nvidia.
 And
 you
 know,
 companies
 are


putting
 up
 the
 earnings
 to
 participate


and
 if
 they
 continue
 putting
 up
 the


earnings,
 hopefully
 they
 continue
 to


participate.
 How
 do
 we
 know
 we're


putting
 up
 the
 earnings?
 Well,
 let's


take
 a
 look
 at
 some
 of
 the
 stats.
 69%
 of


US
 companies
 have
 beaten
 revenue


expectations
 in
 Q3
 so
 far
 in
 2025,
 the


highest
 since
 Q4
 of
 2021.
 The
 last
 time


you
 had
 69%
 of
 companies
 beat


expectations
 was
 69.1%
 in
 Q4
 of
 2021.


That
 means
 it's
 been
 four
 years.
 Last


year,
 this
 was
 53.3%.
 This
 is
 also
 on


track
 to
 be
 the
 fifth
 strongest
 quarter


in
 at
 least
 13
 years.
 By
 comparison,
 the


record
 during
 this
 period
 was
 83.1%.


We're
 at
 69,
 which
 is
 obviously
 not
 that


bad.


25%
 of
 the
 S&P
 500's
 market
 cap
 is
 going


to
 be
 reported
 today
 or
 uh
 over
 the
 next


two
 days
 between
 Wednesday
 and
 Thursday.


So,
 today
 and
 tomorrow,
 but
 the
 fact


that
 we
 are
 seeing
 US
 corporate


companies
 show
 the
 highest
 sales
 beat


ratio
 and
 this
 is
 not
 even
 EPS.
 These


are
 just
 revenue
 beats.
 We're
 going to


get
 EPS
 beats
 in
 a
 bit.
 I
 think
 right


now
 the
 number
 is
 like
 85%
 of
 companies


in
 the
 S&P
 500
 have
 beaten
 on
 earnings.


Uh
 it
 is
 very
 similar
 to
 what
 we
 saw
 in


Q2
 and
 they're
 beating
 by
 double
 digits,


showing
 that
 AI
 might
 be
 affecting


margin
 enhancements.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


that's
 creating
 a
 lot
 of
 momentum
 as


well.
 So
 you're
 seeing
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


divergence
 in
 breath.
 You're
 seeing


companies
 beat
 on
 revenue
 and
 EPS,
 which


is
 very
 important.
 And
 then
 you
 had
 this


stat
 that
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 to
 make
 of.


So
 I'm
 curious
 of
 what
 you
 guys
 have
 to


say.
 Retail
 investors
 are
 now
 trading


1.2


million
 not
 just
 options
 per
 day,
 S&P


500
 zero
 DTE
 options
 per
 day.


Retail
 is
 now
 trading
 1.2
 million
 S&P


500
 zero
 DTE
 options
 per
 day.


Institutional
 investors
 are
 trading
 1.1


million.


In
 other
 words,
 retail
 investors
 are
 now


reflecting
 53%
 of
 the
 total
 S&P
 500
 zero


DTE
 activity.
 According
 to
 the
 CBOE,


retail
 average
 daily
 trading
 volumes


have
 risen
 700%
 over
 the
 past
 5
 years.


Zero
 DTE
 options
 reflected
 over
 60%
 of


the
 total
 uh
 daily
 S&P
 options
 volume


for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 Q3
 2025.


I
 don't
 understand
 this.
 I
 don't
 do
 zero


DTE.
 I
 know
 there's
 a
 ton
 of
 investors


that
 do
 it
 as
 a
 way
 of
 hedging
 and


protecting
 themselves
 and
 all
 this


stuff,
 but
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 just


fascinating
 to
 see
 retail
 be
 this


interested
 in
 things
 that
 expire
 within


hours
 and
 and
 take
 someone's
 got
 to
 be


wrong.
 Someone's
 got
 to
 be
 right,
 right?


And
 I
 don't
 think
 everyone's
 just


turning
 out
 to
 be
 right,
 but
 it
 is
 quite


incredible
 to
 see
 how
 this
 is
 playing


out.
 So
 you've
 have
 massive
 increased


options
 activity
 which
 is
 actually
 super


bullish
 Robin
 Hood
 first
 of
 all
 like


looking
 at
 this
 right
 here
 is
 definitely


bullish
 Robin
 Hood
 but
 it
 also
 indicates


that
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 excitement
 that's


out
 there
 even
 after
 that
 3%
 draw
 down


that
 we
 had
 uh
 over
 the
 past
 two
 weeks


and
 so
 I
 think
 the
 word
 of
 the
 market


right
 now
 or
 the
 way
 to
 describe
 the


market
 is
 resilient
 because
 even
 after


that
 draw
 down
 invidia
 is
 at
 all
 time


highs
 the
 S&P
 500
 is
 at
 all-time
 highs


you're
 getting
 record
 amounts
 of


companies
 start
 to
 beat
 on
 EPS
 and


revenue
 estimates
 and
 you're
 seeing
 the


options
 market
 continue
 to
 to
 pl
 to
 flow


But
 I
 think
 those
 three
 macro
 elements


are
 something
 important
 to
 understand
 in


the
 broader


way
 that
 uh
 we
 are
 seeing
 this
 market


turn
 out
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 Uh


by
 the
 way,
 we
 just
 got
 an
 update.
 Trump


and
 Xi
 will
 be
 meeting
 at
 11:00
 a.m.
 on


Thursday.
 11:00
 a.m.
 on
 Thursday
 in


South
 Korea.
 They
 will
 be
 meeting
 at
 11


a.m.
 on
 Thursday.
 So
 that's
 tomorrow.
 So


we've
 got
 about
 24
 hours
 until
 they


meet.
 7
 minutes
 until
 the
 market
 opens.


And
 it
 looks
 like
 that
 meeting
 will


officially
 be
 happening.
 Again,
 Fubo,


the
 merger
 with
 Disney
 is
 complete.


That's
 why
 Fubo
 is
 up
 20%
 right
 here.


Fiserve,
 unfortunately,
 they
 had
 a


pretty
 crappy
 earnings,
 reduced


guidance.
 That's
 why
 that
 stock
 is
 down


41%
 now.
 Goodness
 gracious,
 that's
 down.


And
 you
 got
 Nvidia
 trying
 to
 crack
 all


highs.
 Let's
 do
 the
 green
 or
 red
 poll
 in


the
 chat.
 Also,
 here's
 a
 question.
 If


you
 own
 Nvidia,
 are
 you
 selling?
 Are
 you


selling
 any
 Nvidia
 at
 all?


Uh,
 green
 or
 red
 today?


What
 do
 we
 think?
 I
 asked
 this
 question


to
 Steve
 yesterday,
 asked
 it
 to
 Tanner.


They
 both
 thought
 about
 it.
 I
 thought


about
 it,
 too.
 But
 then
 I,
 you
 know,


kept
 listening
 to
 what
 Jensen
 said


yesterday.
 I'm
 like,
 I
 don't
 know,
 bro.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 fade
 this
 that


easily.
 By
 the
 way,
 Nokia
 got
 a
 billion


dollar
 investment
 from
 Nvidia
 as
 well.


That's
 down
 2%,
 but
 it
 was
 up
 20%


yesterday.
 So,
 Nokia
 and
 Nvidia
 will
 be


working
 together.
 And
 that
 has
 also


created
 a
 big
 move
 in
 that.


Oh,
 sorry.
 I
 put
 the
 uh
 I
 put
 the
 the


poll
 wrong.
 Sorry.
 80%
 of
 you
 said
 yes


though.
 So
 basically
 that
 means
 green.


Basically
 that
 means
 green.
 Sorry.
 Green


or
 red?


Green
 or
 red
 today?
 What
 do
 we
 think?


Dude,
 my
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 sell.


I
 I
 just
 think
 like
 look,
 is
 it
 going
 to


hold
 208?
 I
 have
 no
 idea.
 Could
 it
 go


back
 down
 below
 200?
 Of
 course,
 that's


very
 possible.
 But
 I
 just
 feel
 like


based
 on
 what
 Jensen
 said
 yesterday
 and


based
 on
 the
 scale
 of
 partnerships


they're
 operating
 with,
 particularly


around
 humanoid
 robotics,
 which
 is


something
 Jensen
 really
 focused
 on.
 I


don't
 know,
 dude.
 It
 doesn't
 like
 a
 lot


of
 these
 other
 names
 in
 the
 data
 center


space
 and
 the
 broader
 AI
 space,
 you


could
 say,
 have
 risks
 associated
 with


them.
 Nvidia
 obviously
 has
 risks
 as


well,
 but
 everything
 goes
 back
 to


Nvidia.
 So
 I
 haven't
 fully
 done
 my
 due


diligence
 on
 Core
 Weave
 enough
 to
 know


if
 I
 should
 have
 a
 position
 on
 it,
 but
 I


do
 know
 that
 they
 will
 benefit
 if
 Nvidia


benefits.
 So
 I
 do
 have
 and
 technically
 I


have
 exposure
 to
 Core
 via
 Nvidia.
 Same


thing
 with
 the
 data
 center
 companies.
 If


you
 have
 Nvidia,
 you
 kind
 of
 have


massive
 exposure
 to
 everything
 and


without
 Nvidia
 all
 those
 other
 companies


fail.
 It
 like
 point
 blank
 without
 Nvidia


all
 of
 the
 there
 is
 no
 data
 center


revolution
 without
 Nvidia.


So
 it's
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where
 I
 feel


like
 you
 you
 don't
 sell
 the
 the
 one


that's
 controlling
 the
 entire
 ecosystem.


Okay,
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 more
 people
 saying
 no.


I
 see
 a
 few
 yeses
 though.


Few
 people
 want
 to
 trim
 going
 into
 the


end
 of
 the
 year,


but


most
 people
 saying
 no.
 Nebius
 right


here.
 Corweav's
 up
 in
 the
 pre-market.


Nebius,
 are
 we
 green?
 Nebas
 is
 green.


12387.
 Nebius
 fell
 yesterday
 because


people
 expected
 some
 massive


announcement
 at
 GTC
 and
 then
 there
 was


no
 announcement.
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 that


rumor
 started
 from
 that
 Nebus
 is
 going


to
 be
 announcing
 something
 big,
 but


people
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 too
 excited
 then


Nebius
 didn't
 make
 an
 announcement
 and


then
 that
 one
 got
 hit
 off.
 Ian
 is
 down


because
 they
 got
 hit
 with
 a
 downgrade


today
 by
 HC
 Waywright.
 They
 said
 um
 the


firm
 believes
 investor
 optimism
 around


Iran's
 artificial
 intelligence
 cloud


business
 has
 reached
 a
 point
 of


irrational
 exuberance
 and
 they


downgraded
 it
 to
 a
 cell
 with
 a
 price


target
 of
 45.
 I
 have
 not
 done
 a
 ton
 of


DD
 into
 Iran
 to
 fully
 understand
 the


numbers.
 From
 what
 I
 understand,
 they're


one
 of the
 better
 data
 center
 plays


that's
 out
 there
 that
 actually
 has
 a
 lot


more
 GPU
 capacity.
 But
 you
 do
 have
 some


firms
 thinking
 that
 the
 price
 is
 a
 bit


aggressive
 and
 that's
 why
 they're


suggesting
 to
 sell.
 Amazon
 right
 there


232.
 That
 is
 also
 green
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 You
 own
 SMCI?
 Yes,
 I
 own


SMCI.


I
 bought
 a
 little
 bit
 when
 it
 fell
 to
 48


last
 week.
 So,
 I
 averaged
 down
 on
 SMCI.


I
 I
 think
 the
 SMCI
 thesis
 is
 pretty


simple.
 I
 just
 think
 like
 if
 we're
 going


to
 sell
 more
 GPUs,
 we're
 going to
 need


more
 server
 racks.
 It's
 not
 I
 I
 don't


even
 think
 it's
 that
 complicated.
 And


this
 one's
 basically
 made
 a
 full


recovery
 from
 last
 week
 after
 it
 fell
 9%


when
 they
 gave
 preliminary
 guidance.
 So


you
 got
 SMCI
 right
 there
 at
 5423.


All right.
 So
 we
 got
 the
 market
 open
 in


3
 minutes.
 We
 got
 FOMC
 at
 230.
 And
 then


obviously
 we
 got
 the
 googs.
 We
 got
 Meta.


We
 got
 Microsoft.
 It
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


wild
 day
 folks.
 It
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 wild


freaking
 day.


Nebus
 newsletter
 should
 be
 out
 on


Saturday
 for
 those
 that
 are
 asking
 on


the
 substack.
 Nebus
 newsletter
 should
 be


out
 on
 Saturday.
 So,
 uh
 I
 am
 still
 doing


my
 DD
 on
 Nebus,
 but
 I
 think
 it
 should
 be


I
 mean
 worst
 case
 it
 comes
 out
 on


Sunday,
 but
 should
 be
 out
 on
 this


weekend
 and
 that'll
 be
 out
 for


everybody.


Uh
 yeah,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 wild
 day.
 We


got
 PAL
 I
 we
 I
 don't
 think
 we've
 ever


had
 three
 large
 caps
 report
 on
 the
 same


day
 the
 way
 that
 they're
 reporting


today.
 But
 uh
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those
 days


where
 you
 just
 got
 to
 lock
 in.
 I'll
 be


here
 the
 whole
 time.
 And
 so
 we're
 gonna


see
 what
 happens
 throughout
 the
 entire


day.


We're
 gonna
 see
 how
 these
 companies
 uh


put
 up
 numbers.
 Like
 look,
 I
 don't
 want


to
 get
 too
 optimistic,
 but
 if
 Meta,


Google,
 and
 Microsoft
 crush,
 like
 legit


crush,
 and
 we
 get
 the
 rate
 cuts,
 is
 it


crazy
 to
 say
 7,000
 could
 happen
 today
 on


the
 S&P?
 And
 again,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be


too
 excited
 about
 it,
 but
 I'm
 talking


about
 they
 absolutely
 demolish
 earnings.


All
 three
 of
 those
 companies
 are
 like


collectively
 think
 14%
 of
 the
 S&P
 500.


So
 like
 if
 they
 all
 move,
 you're
 going


to
 see
 the
 S&P
 500
 move.
 It's
 just
 going


to
 be
 a
 wild
 day.
 And
 then
 if
 you
 get


the
 rate
 cut,
 obviously
 that's
 also


bullish
 for
 the
 broader
 market.
 So
 this


is
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of
 those
 days.
 And
 we


don't
 even
 know
 what's
 going
 to
 happen


with
 Nvidia.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 at
 207
 right


here.
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 to
 say
 if


this
 is
 going
 to
 keep
 going
 up
 or
 down.


I
 mean,
 you
 would
 imagine
 some
 people


take
 some
 profits
 right
 here,
 but
 then


again,
 it
 busted
 through
 200
 like
 it
 had


no
 issues.
 So
 maybe
 people
 say,
 you
 know


what,
 I'm
 holding
 on.
 especially
 after


Jensen
 revised
 these
 these
 targets
 on
 um


on
 revenue
 for
 the
 next
 five
 quarters.


So,
 why
 would
 I
 sell?
 I
 mean,
 you


probably
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 thinking


that
 and
 they're
 not
 gonna
 sell.
 And
 if


they're
 not
 going
 to
 sell,
 then
 you


know,
 this
 price
 might
 not
 have
 to
 to


take
 a
 hit.


So,
 there
 you
 go.
 Yeah,
 207
 is
 already


over
 five
 trillion.
 As
 soon
 as
 it
 opens,


we
 will
 have
 a
 $5
 trillion
 Nvidia.
 And


it's
 amazing
 that
 in
 our
 lifetimes,
 we


were
 able
 to
 see
 this.
 By
 the
 way,


Nphase
 nasty
 earnings
 yesterday,
 that's


down
 13%.
 Unfortunately,
 they
 have
 just


not
 been
 able
 to
 tap
 into
 this
 energy


revolution
 via
 solar.
 Visa's
 up
 a
 little


bit
 based
 on
 their
 earnings
 yesterday.


EA's
 down
 a
 little bit.
 Bloom
 Energy
 not


in
 the
 solar
 space.
 They're
 up
 12%.


Shout
 out
 to
 Tess.
 I
 know
 she's
 in
 that


one.
 And
 uh
 that
 one
 has
 done
 very
 well.


So,
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 different


divergence
 between
 some
 of the
 energy


companies
 in
 different
 sectors
 versus


the
 other
 ones
 that
 are
 trying
 to


position
 themselves
 for
 this
 AI
 data


center
 revolution.


All right,
 folks.
 Here
 we
 go.
 It
 is
 9:30


a.m.
 Wednesday,
 October
 29th.
 It
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 crazy
 day.


The
 stock
 market
 is
 now
 open.


All right,
 wake
 your
 ass
 up.
 Let's
 get


into
 it.
 Nvidia,
 5.1
 trillion.


5.1
 trillion
 for
 Mr.
 Nvidia.
 We
 are


alive
 to
 witness
 a
 company
 worth
 5


trillion.
 20742
 that's
 up
 3.14%
 as
 we


get
 into
 the
 market
 open.
 Tessy
 462


that's
 up
 half
 a
 percent.
 Palunteer
 191


19283
 is
 the
 all-time
 high.
 Maybe
 we
 can


break
 that
 today
 again.
 Karp
 and
 Jensen


were
 on
 stage
 yesterday
 talking
 about


the
 partnership
 between
 their
 two


companies.
 Paler
 right
 there
 191.4.


That's
 up
 half
 a
 percent
 right
 there.


AMD
 wow
 all-time
 highs.
 AMD
 all-time


highs.
 So
 532
 all-time
 highs.


Google
 about
 to
 beat
 270
 26973.


S&P
 688.
 AMD
 moving
 with
 Nvidia


basically.
 Let
 me
 go
 to
 the
 semis
 real


quick.
 All
 the
 semis
 should
 be
 moving


together
 I
 would
 imagine.
 Semis.
 Yeah,


look
 at
 the
 semis.
 Micron
 3%
 AMD
 3%.


Nvidia
 4%.
 Oh
 my
 god.
 Nvidia's
 going
 for


209.
 Oh,
 she
 hit
 209.
 She
 hit
 209
 for
 a


millisecond.
 Got
 rejected
 right
 at
 209.


She
 did
 hit
 it
 20812
 on
 Nvidia.
 ASML
 is


up
 2%.
 SMCI
 is
 up
 3%.
 Intel's
 up
 half%.


TSM's
 up
 2%.
 Qualcomm's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


AN
 is
 up.
 Marvel
 is
 up.
 ARM
 is
 up.


Broadcom
 is
 up.
 Obviously,
 SMH,


Semiconductor
 ETF,
 which
 is
 now
 50%
 this


year,
 is
 up
 another
 2%.
 Absolutely


incredible.
 So,
 you're
 getting
 the
 semis


get
 a
 lot
 of
 love.
 Meta's
 up
 half
 a


percent.
 Salesforce
 and
 PayPal
 are
 down.


Salesforce
 and
 PayPal
 are
 down.
 Nvidia,


wow,
 209.


Is
 it
 about
 to
 break
 it
 again?
 It
 looked


like
 it
 just
 Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 20907


on
 Nvidia.
 20908.


20937.
 Okay,
 now
 it's
 just
 breaking


through.
 Now
 it's
 just
 breaking
 through.


Cheesecake
 Factories
 down
 5%.
 Palenteer


192
 very
 close
 to
 breaking.
 Palanteer's


all-time
 high.
 Google
 again
 269.
 You
 got


Pterodine
 that's
 making
 a
 big
 move


today.
 Um
 that
 is
 up.
 Caterpillar
 that's


up
 9%.
 They
 crushed
 earnings
 as
 well.


210.
 Are
 we
 at
 210?
 Did
 we
 touch
 it?
 We


did
 not
 touch
 it
 yet.
 20988.
 We
 did
 not


touch
 210
 yet.
 I'll
 check
 resistance
 for


it,
 but
 it
 looks
 like
 it
 is
 very


possible.
 Nvidia
 again
 209.
 Palantry
 at


192.


5
 trillion.
 Well,
 now
 it's
 more
 than
 5


trillion.
 Now
 it's
 5.15
 trillion
 on


Nvidia.
 And
 then
 SoFi,
 are
 we
 at
 32?


Wow.
 SoFi.
 All right.
 So,
 SoFi
 getting
 a


little bit
 of
 a
 delayed
 reaction
 from


yesterday.
 There
 you
 go.
 SoFi
 making
 its


move.
 3224


up
 2%.
 Uh
 210
 has
 300,000
 shares


waiting.
 300,000
 shares
 waiting
 to
 be


sold
 for
 210.
 The
 NASDAQ
 the
 Q
 636.


That's
 an
 all-time
 high
 on
 the
 NASDAQ.


There
 you
 go.
 S&P
 500
 very
 close
 to
 690.


688.90


on
 the
 S&P.
 City
 Bank
 did
 upgrade
 SoFi.


So
 did
 Jeffre.
 Where's
 CleanSpark?
 That


stock
 is
 up
 6%
 after
 they
 acquired
 some


more
 land.
 Iran,
 they
 did
 get
 a


downgrade
 today,
 but
 I
 is
 down
 about


1.2%.
 Not
 that
 crazy.
 Dualingo
 that
 is


down
 again
 below
 300.
 I
 don't
 know
 why


Dolingo
 is
 getting
 hit
 in
 the
 as
 soon
 as


the
 market
 opens.
 Looks
 like
 there's
 got


to
 be
 some
 reason
 there,
 but
 that
 one


losing
 the
 300s.
 That's
 down.
 Disney's


down.
 Square
 is
 down.
 Intel's
 slightly


flagged.
 GameStop's
 down.
 Arch
 is
 up
 a


little
 bit.
 Joby
 partnered
 with
 Nvidia


yesterday.
 And
 that's
 why
 Joby
 got
 a
 bit


of
 a
 boost.
 Joby
 right
 there
 is
 up
 6%


right
 here.$210
 on
 Nvidia.
 Wow.
 $210


on
 Nvidia.


Oh
 my
 goodness.


My
 goodness.
 210


up
 4%
 folks.
 That
 is
 a
 uh
 that's
 a
 930


move.
 That
 is
 that's
 a
 $223
 billion


move.


$223
 billion
 move.
 S&P
 500
 688.
 Google


that's
 up
 half
 a
 percent.
 So
 still
 up


1.3.
 Pound
 here
 up
 1.25
 192.
 S&P
 at
 688.


And
 then
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 at
 $210.


Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 let's
 ring
 the


bell
 for
 Nvidia.
 Congratulations.
 210,


world's
 most
 valuable
 company
 at
 5


trillion.


We
 are
 getting
 to
 live
 through
 this.


It's
 about
 to
 hit
 211,
 folks.
 We
 are


getting
 to
 live
 through
 this.
 It's
 about


to
 hit
 211.
 For
 those
 that
 are
 wondering


why,
 like
 why
 is
 there
 this
 surge


happening?
 Forget
 all
 the
 stuff
 you


heard
 about
 yesterday
 in
 terms
 of


partnerships.
 There
 you
 go.
 We're
 at


211.
 It's
 because
 Jensen
 said
 we're


going
 to
 do
 500
 billion
 in
 the
 next
 five


quarters.
 Every
 single
 earnings
 estimate


has
 to
 go
 higher
 when
 the
 CEO
 of
 the


company
 says
 that
 all
 of
 you
 guys
 are


off
 on
 your
 earnings
 by
 120
 billion.


Like
 that
 that
 that's
 the
 simple
 reason.


If
 you
 don't
 want
 the
 mumbo
 jumbo
 about


the
 AI
 revolution,
 then
 boom,
 the
 the


$500
 billion
 revenue
 target,
 that
 in
 of


itself
 is
 enough.
 uh
 to
 get
 people
 to


upgrade
 the
 stock.
 BFA
 Securities
 raised


their
 price
 target
 to
 275.
 Without


reading
 through
 the
 whole
 thing,
 as
 you


can
 see,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 numbers
 on
 the


screen.
 They're
 increasing
 all
 their


estimates
 and
 they
 have
 to
 increase


their
 estimates
 because
 when
 you
 know


when
 Jensen
 says
 something
 like
 that,


you
 have
 to
 take
 him
 at
 his
 word.
 Uh
 and


by
 the
 way,
 all
 of
 that
 all
 of
 that
 is


excluding
 China.


And
 because
 all
 of
 that
 is
 excluding


China,
 that
 is
 why
 now
 that
 Trump's


getting
 ready
 to
 talk
 to
 Xi,
 I
 think


people
 are
 front
 running
 that
 uh
 if


China
 revenue
 is
 coming
 in,
 that
 number


is
 only
 going
 to
 be
 higher.


And
 that's
 why
 Nvidia
 is
 getting
 some


love.
 Amcor
 is
 up
 4%.
 Yeah,
 Amcor
 back


to
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 I
 I
 bought
 the
 dip.
 Yeah,


I
 bought
 at
 30
 and
 I
 bought
 again
 at
 31


and
 then
 I
 bought
 at
 3250.
 That
 was


those
 were
 my
 three
 buys
 yesterday.
 And


this
 was
 stupid,
 dude.
 This
 was
 stupid.


It
 did
 not
 deserve,
 I
 think,
 to
 go
 to
 28


on
 a
 record
 Q3
 just
 because
 the
 CEO
 is


stepping
 down
 and
 someone
 who
 has
 20


years
 of
 experience
 is
 taking
 his
 spot.


And
 again,
 what
 did
 Jensen
 talk
 about


yesterday?
 He
 talked
 about
 American


manufacturing.
 AMC
 is
 going
 to
 play
 a


big
 role
 in
 that.
 Intel
 is
 going
 to
 play


a
 big
 role
 in
 that.
 SMCI,
 as
 per
 what


they
 said
 today,
 is
 going
 to
 play
 a
 big


role
 in
 that.
 All
 of
 these
 things
 you


can
 kind
 of
 chalk
 up
 to
 this
 idea
 of


American
 re-industrialization,
 and
 that


starts
 with
 Nvidia.
 Nvidia,
 right?


They're
 21130


as
 well.
 Now,
 let's
 see
 some
 of
 the


breath
 in
 the
 market
 because
 we
 talked


about
 that
 stat
 today,
 right?
 That
 a
 lot


of
 all-time
 highs
 were
 happening
 on
 the


big
 tech
 names,
 but
 everything
 else
 was


getting
 hit.
 TLT
 is
 down,
 Appven's
 down,


Circle's
 down,
 Pinterest
 is
 down,


Nphase,
 not
 the
 best
 earnings.
 That's


down.
 Microsoft's
 flat.
 Micro


Strategyy's
 down.
 That's
 more
 crypto.
 AS


had
 a
 big
 news
 with
 the
 Saudis
 today.


That's
 why
 that's
 up.
 Whereas
 Amazon,


are
 we
 still
 holding
 230?
 Uh,
 we're
 at


least
 holding
 230.
 That
 one's
 getting
 a


bit
 of a
 red
 candle.
 Grab
 is
 down.


Again,
 I
 think
 the
 street's
 waiting
 for


earnings
 at
 this
 point.
 until
 we
 get


those
 earnings,
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 have
 an
 accurate
 description
 of


what
 actually
 is
 the
 trajectory
 of
 this


stock.
 And
 so
 on
 Monday,
 we're
 going
 to


get
 a
 better
 understanding
 of
 that.
 I


did
 buy
 the
 grab
 dip
 yesterday
 at
 around


592.
 So
 right
 there,
 3165
 that
 goes
 red,


loses
 uh
 32.


Uh
 Nvidia
 right
 here,
 that's
 up
 5%,
 211,


still
 holding
 211.
 PayPal
 obviously


has
 lost
 a
 lot
 of
 its
 gains
 as
 well.


Wow.
 7148.
 Basically
 losing
 everything


from
 yesterday,
 unfortunately.
 and


Fiserve
 didn't
 help
 that
 today.
 So,


PayPal
 is
 down.
 ETH
 is
 slowly
 losing
 4K.


Really,
 Nvidia
 is
 one
 of
 the
 only
 names


that's
 holding
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 green
 today.


And
 that's
 holding
 up
 the
 S&P.
 Nvidia
 is


still
 holding
 210.
 Nvidia
 just
 or
 ETH


just
 below
 4,000,
 but
 the
 S&P
 is
 still


up.3%.


I
 dare
 you
 to
 open
 up
 Fiser.
 Okay,
 what


do
 we
 got?


Oh
 my
 goodness,
 dude.
 45%.


The
 stock
 just
 lost
 50
 billion
 in
 market


cap.
 Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.
 All
 the


semis
 are
 up
 today.
 Everything
 else
 is
 a


little
 flat.
 It's
 not
 necessarily
 red,


it's
 just
 more
 flat.
 Um,
 Meta
 basically


flat
 as
 well.
 AMD
 that's
 still
 at
 all


time
 highs
 up
 2.19%
 and
 then
 Nvidia


still
 green
 on
 the
 day.


Uh,
 Garmin
 missed
 on
 revenue.
 I
 think


they
 beat
 on
 EPS.
 Is
 Garmin
 down?
 Garmin


is
 Wow.
 All right,
 that
 was
 a
 bad
 miss


on
 revenue.
 I
 guess
 Garmin
 down
 11%.


This
 is
 GPS
 communication
 technology
 42


billion
 market
 cap.
 All right.
 So
 Garmin


and
 Fiser
 so
 far
 have
 been
 the
 two


companies
 of
 this
 cycle
 that
 have
 had


pretty
 aggressive
 misses
 uh
 which
 has


led
 to
 their
 stocks
 getting
 hit.
 Verizon


right
 they're
 up
 4%.
 They
 had
 a
 beat
 on


EPS.


But
 those
 are
 the
 major
 companies
 that


are
 like
 above
 20
 30
 billion
 in
 market


cap
 that
 have
 taken
 a
 pretty
 big
 hit.


Uber
 had
 a
 partnership
 with
 Nvidia


yesterday.
 That's
 why
 Uber
 is
 getting


some
 love.
 Well,
 it
 was
 getting
 some


love.
 Now
 it
 just
 went
 red.
 Also,
 uh,


Uber
 is
 going
 to
 be
 licensing
 some
 of


Lucid's
 autonomous
 technology.
 As
 per
 an


announcement
 today,
 Uber
 plans
 to
 start


offering
 driverless
 rides
 in
 San


Francisco
 next
 year
 using
 Lucid's


gravity
 SUVs
 equipped
 with
 neurosdriving


tech.


Okay,
 so
 Lucid's
 cars,
 neuros
 tech


testing
 is
 already
 underway.
 Is
 Lucid
 up


on
 this
 news?
 Lucid
 is
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


It
 was
 up
 more.


Nvidia
 is
 holding
 it.
 everything
 else
 is


trying
 to
 hold
 or
 going
 red.
 If
 it's


going
 red,
 it's
 not
 going
 that
 red,
 but


it's
 definitely
 losing
 the
 steam
 that
 it


had
 in
 the
 first
 couple
 minutes.
 But


people,
 it's
 almost
 like
 people
 are


selling
 everything
 to
 buy
 Nvidia.
 It's


almost
 like
 I
 mean,
 that
 that
 was
 kind


of
 the
 argument
 for
 crypto
 yesterday.
 A


lot
 of
 people
 are
 just
 taking
 profits
 in


crypto
 and
 saying,
 you
 know
 what,


Bitcoin's
 not
 moving.
 I'm
 getting


impatient.
 Jensen
 just
 told
 me
 he's


going
 to
 do
 500
 billion
 in
 five


quarters.
 I
 should
 probably
 bet
 on
 that.


Fubu
 right
 here
 now
 down
 uh
 or
 up
 9%.
 It


was
 up
 25%.
 So,
 Fubu,
 Fubo,


uh,
 getting
 hit
 pretty
 bad
 in
 terms
 of


the
 pre-market
 move.
 S&P
 still
 moving


higher.
 New
 alltime
 high.


New
 alltime
 high
 on
 the
 S&P.


And
 it
 has
 to
 be
 led
 with
 Nvidia.


It
 has
 to
 be
 led
 with
 Nvidia.
 Look
 at


this.
 Nvidia
 5.119
 trillion.
 Apple
 back


to
 4
 trillion.
 Microsoft
 back
 to
 four


trillion.


What
 do
 people
 think?
 Is
 this
 toppy
 or


is
 this
 just
 a
 function
 of
 the
 market?


Do
 people
 feel
 toppy
 or
 it's
 a
 function


of
 the
 market?


I
 can
 understand
 the
 toiness
 feelings.


Adobe
 by
 the
 way
 dumping.
 But
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day,
 look
 here,
 here's
 two


reasons
 for
 why
 it's
 not
 toppy.
 Number


one,
 Nvidia
 increased
 all
 the
 earnings


estimates
 yesterday.
 So,
 this
 is
 just


increasing
 the
 EPS
 targets,
 which
 to
 me


is
 not
 toppy
 because
 you
 have
 new
 data


that
 the
 market's
 interpreting.
 Adobe


down
 4%.
 The
 other
 reason
 it's
 not
 toppy


is
 because
 Adobe
 is
 down
 4%.
 Ferve
 is


down
 40%.
 Like
 in
 this
 market,
 if
 you


don't
 put
 up
 the
 right
 numbers,
 your


stock
 gets
 destroyed.
 If
 Google,
 Meta,


or
 Amazon
 or
 or
 uh
 Microsoft
 don't
 put


up
 good
 numbers
 today,
 their
 stocks
 are


getting
 hit,
 especially
 because
 all
 of


them
 are
 up
 a
 lot
 this
 year.
 Google's


the
 the
 best
 that's
 up.
 So,
 like,
 I


think
 it's
 a
 healthy
 market.
 If
 you


don't
 put
 up
 the
 numbers,
 you
 get


destroyed.
 Nvidia
 has
 continued
 to
 put


up
 the
 numbers
 in
 the
 face
 of
 all
 the


doubters
 thinking
 they
 wouldn't
 be
 able


to
 put
 up
 the
 numbers.
 And
 this
 is
 all


without
 the
 world's
 second
 largest


economy
 buying
 their
 product.


So,
 I
 think
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 as


toppy
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 companies


that
 are
 getting
 a
 premium
 versus
 the


companies
 that
 are
 not.
 I
 don't
 know
 why


Adobe's
 down,
 though.
 That's
 kind
 of


weird.
 Adobe,
 again,
 it's
 had
 a
 bad


narrative
 on
 AI,
 just
 like
 Duolingo
 for


the
 past
 couple
 of
 weeks.
 Adobe's


numbers
 as
 a
 SAS
 company,
 if
 you
 look
 at


it,
 obviously
 look
 cheap.
 Same
 things


with
 Salesforce,
 but
 there
 hasn't
 been
 a


compelling
 reason
 to
 be
 excited
 about


it.
 Um,
 they
 had
 a
 big
 conference


yesterday.
 Barkclay
 has
 upgraded
 them
 to


465
 based
 on
 that
 conference.
 Adobe


unveiled
 AI
 updates
 for
 image,
 audio,


and
 video
 creation.
 Adobe
 rolled
 out


sweeping
 artificial
 intelligence


enhancements
 across
 the
 creative


ecosystem.


It's
 almost
 like
 the
 street
 does
 not


care.


It's
 like
 they're
 selling
 it
 for
 Nvidia.


That's
 kind
 of
 what
 it
 feels
 like.


HubSpot,
 that's
 down
 1%
 as
 well
 as
 we


get
 into
 the
 market
 open.
 Adobe
 is


boring.
 Nobody
 wants
 boring
 money
 right


now.
 Yeah,
 that's
 Look,
 that's
 a
 fair


point.
 Nobody
 wants
 when
 you
 see
 Nvidia


go
 up
 400
 billion
 in
 less
 than
 24
 hours.


People
 do
 not
 want
 to
 be
 stuck
 in


something
 that's
 not
 moving,
 which
 is


not
 the
 best
 strategy
 to
 just
 sell
 and


chase,
 but
 nonetheless,
 that's
 what


happens.


And
 you
 might
 be
 seeing
 this
 happen


right
 now.


Um,


Nvidia
 still
 holding
 210.
 We
 got
 to


21163.
 Wolf
 is
 down
 12%.
 No,
 2%.
 Okay.


Wolfe
 had
 a
 good
 preliminary
 estimate


yesterday.
 That's
 why
 they
 were
 up
 20%.


Let's
 go
 to
 the
 data
 center
 plays.
 First


of
 all,
 let's
 go
 to
 regionals
 or
 rare


earths.
 Rare
 earths,
 some
 of
 them
 are


up,
 some
 of
 them
 are
 down.
 TMQ
 is
 down


4%.
 CRML
 is
 down
 4%.
 Um,
 Bitcoin
 miners


are
 all
 down
 except
 Marathon,
 Galaxy,


Hive,
 CleanSpark,
 and
 Cipher,
 but


CleanSpark's
 losing
 a
 lot
 of
 its
 gains.


Cipher
 is
 basically
 about
 to
 go
 red.


IN's
 down
 2%.


Again,
 a
 lot
 of these
 stocks
 are
 up
 a


lot
 this
 year,
 so
 they're
 still
 probably


just
 consolidating,
 taking
 a
 breather.


Bit
 forms
 right
 there
 425.
 Then
 what's


the
 other
 one?
 Nebius
 and
 Cororeweave.


Nebas
 goes
 red
 121.


Coreweave
 is
 slightly
 up.
 Oh,
 did
 we
 get


all
 time
 highs
 on
 pounds
 here?
 Did
 we
 do


it?
 Wow,
 we
 did
 it.
 193.


We
 did
 it.


193.


She
 is
 here,
 baby.


Kind
 of
 felt
 like
 it
 was
 it
 was
 gonna


happen
 after
 that
 Nvidia
 partnership.


There
 she
 is.
 pile
 into
 your
 193,


dude.
 All right,
 let's
 check
 what's


better
 than
 193.
 Let's
 You
 guys
 know
 the


number
 better
 than
 193
 right
 here
 is


194.
 It
 got
 very
 close
 to
 194.
 Oh
 boy.


194.
 I
 don't
 even
 got
 to
 check


resistance.
 I
 don't
 even
 got
 to
 check


resistance.
 194


on
 Palunteer.


You
 know
 what's
 better
 than
 194?


195
 is
 92,000
 shares.
 92,000
 shares.


We'll
 ring
 the
 bell
 at
 195.
 We
 can
 get


it.
 See
 if
 we
 can
 get
 195,


dude.
 That's
 incredible.


The
 group
 chat
 I'm
 in
 is
 definitely


going
 to
 be
 pissed
 off
 at
 me,
 though.
 I


told
 you
 guys
 the
 story
 right
 last
 week.


They're
 like,
 "Guys,
 what's
 the
 buy?"


And
 I
 was
 like, "It's
 Palanteer."
 And


they're
 like, "Shut
 up.
 We're
 not
 buying


Paler."
 I
 was
 like, "Dude,
 I
 know
 it's
 I


I'll
 be
 the
 first
 one
 to
 tell
 you
 it's


expensive."
 Like,
 not
 saying
 it's
 cheap.


I'm
 just
 saying
 I
 think
 this
 quarter
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 good
 quarter
 and
 it's
 at


170.
 It's
 been
 stuck
 at
 170
 to
 185
 for


like
 five
 months.
 I
 think
 it
 has
 a


breakout
 coming
 if
 they
 deliver
 a
 really


good
 quarter.


And
 uh
 it
 looks
 like
 we
 don't
 have
 a


quarter
 yet,
 but
 a
 Jensen
 partnership
 is


definitely


definitely
 very
 helpful.
 And
 so
 maybe


that
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 1942
 28
 right


there
 on
 Palanteer.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Nvidia


210.
 So
 Nvidia
 and
 Pounder
 kind
 of


leading
 the
 S&P
 500
 today.
 Pounder
 is
 in


the
 S&P
 500
 in
 the
 S&P
 689
 alltime


highs.
 Tesla
 just
 went
 green.
 Tesla's


well
 just
 went
 green.


You
 know,
 I
 bought
 more.
 I
 bought
 more


pounder
 for
 my
 sister.
 I
 bought
 more


pounder
 for
 my
 sister.
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 I


told
 you
 guys
 that
 either.
 So,
 she
 has


700
 shares
 that
 I
 bought
 her
 at
 20
 that


she's
 had
 for
 the
 longest.
 And
 I
 bought


more
 pounder
 for
 myself.
 And
 then
 the


other
 day
 I
 was
 like,
 "All
 right,
 it's


at
 175
 180."
 And
 she
 hasn't
 added
 or
 I


haven't
 added
 for
 her
 since


last
 time
 I
 added
 was
 April
 of
 2024.


And
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 dude,
 who


cares
 about
 this
 $20
 cost
 average?
 Like,


at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 if
 we
 think


Palunteer
 is
 going
 higher,
 then
 I
 should


get
 her
 more.
 So,
 I
 added
 another
 400


shares
 of
 Pounder
 for
 her.
 So,
 now
 she


has
 1,200
 shares.
 Her
 average
 is
 84.


And
 uh
 she
 probably
 doesn't
 even
 know


that
 I
 added
 Palunteer
 for
 her,
 but
 I


did
 buy
 more
 pounder
 for
 her.
 194
 still


on
 Palunteer.
 Nvidia
 at
 210,
 Tesla
 at


460,
 and
 the
 S&P
 689.
 Yeah,
 she
 says


cool.


I
 think
 I
 bought
 her
 shares
 at
 181
 is


what
 I
 added
 for.
 Maybe
 some
 of
 them


were
 179,
 but
 basically
 in
 that
 180


range,
 which
 look,
 I
 know
 it's


expensive.
 I
 get
 it.
 I'm
 not
 here
 saying


it's
 cheap.
 I'm
 just
 saying
 I
 think
 what


what
 is
 the
 streak
 going
 to
 do
 when
 they


report
 50%
 growth?
 No
 other
 company,


that's
 why
 Jensen
 said
 they
 are
 the


fastest
 growing
 and
 single
 most


important
 enterprise
 stack
 yesterday.


And
 there's
 no
 other
 company
 that's


putting
 up
 the
 numbers
 to
 compare.


And
 so,
 you
 know,
 sometimes
 your
 best


ideas
 are
 your
 best
 ideas.
 And
 you
 don't


always
 need
 a
 new
 idea.
 You
 just
 need
 to


continue
 consolidating
 into
 the
 ideas


that
 you
 really
 want
 to
 hold
 for
 the


long
 term.
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 21084


on
 the
 day.
 ALD
 is
 that
 green?
 ALD
 that


is
 also
 green.
 3565.
 They
 will
 not
 do
 a


stock
 split
 anytime
 soon.
 I
 mean
 most


companies
 wait
 until
 they're
 like
 $500


for
 a
 stock
 split.
 At least
 350
 400


usually
 in
 the
 500
 range.
 Sometimes
 I've


seen
 companies
 do
 it
 in
 the
 $300
 range,


but
 I
 don't
 think
 you're
 getting
 a
 stock


split
 in
 the
 $200
 range.


Um,
 but
 I
 think
 over
 time
 eventually


that
 could
 happen.


Okay,
 so
 Nvidia
 is
 still
 moving.
 Bank
 of


Canada
 cut
 their
 policy
 rate
 by
 25
 pips.


The
 Bank
 of
 Canada
 had
 a
 meeting
 today.


I
 didn't
 even
 know
 that.
 Okay,
 Bank
 of


Canada,
 we
 got
 some
 rate
 cuts
 today,
 so


that's
 good.
 Central
 banks
 across
 the


board
 are
 cutting.
 Uh,
 yeah,
 there
 you


go.
 25
 bips
 for
 the
 Bank
 of
 Canada.


JPAL's
 probably
 going
 to
 follow
 it
 up


with
 the
 Bank
 of
 Canada
 or
 with
 with
 25


BIPS
 as
 well.
 We
 also
 have
 some
 data
 on


mortgage
 rates.
 Uh,
 let
 me
 pull
 this
 up


real
 quick.
 US
 mortgage
 rates.
 Wow.


Lowest
 in
 a
 year,
 6.3%.
 Where's
 Open


Door?
 Is
 Open
 Door
 getting
 helped?
 Open


Door
 is
 flat
 or
 Open
 Door
 is
 down.
 Open


Door
 is
 down.
 So,
 mortgage
 rates
 lowest


we've
 seen
 in
 a
 year.
 Open
 Door
 is
 still


down.
 What's
 the
 volume
 on
 Nvidia?


That's
 a
 good
 question.
 Volume
 is
 70


million
 shares.
 Average
 is
 170.
 So,


they've
 done
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 that


volume
 in
 the
 first
 15
 minutes.
 Zillow,


by
 the
 way,
 7380.
 That's
 down
 as
 well.


Farzod,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Congrats
 on
 pounder
 alltime
 high.
 Uh


Farz,
 I
 want to
 say
 congrats
 to
 you
 for


sticking
 with
 your
 conviction
 about


Tesla
 not
 selling
 the
 cyber
 cab
 with
 a


steering
 wheel.
 I
 know
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of


[ __ ]
 from
 the
 Tesla
 community
 about


that,
 but
 it
 looks
 like
 Farzod
 was


vindicated
 yesterday.
 Um,
 and
 let's
 just


say
 he
 took
 a
 victory
 lap.
 I
 have
 no


idea
 what
 this
 uh
 steering
 wheel


controversy
 is.
 I've
 seen
 a
 few
 of


Farzod's
 tweets
 about
 it,
 but
 um


yeah,
 apparently
 this
 was
 the
 news.


Tesla
 will
 put
 a
 steering
 wheel
 and


pedals
 in
 the
 cyber
 cab
 if
 that's
 what


regulators
 require
 according
 to
 the


Tesla
 chair.


Let's
 just
 say
 Farzod
 was
 pretty
 happy


when
 he
 saw
 that
 news
 yesterday.
 And
 so


I
 have
 no
 idea.
 steering
 wheel


announced.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 why


it
 matters,
 but
 it's
 been
 like
 this
 hot


debate
 in
 the
 Tesla
 community
 and
 far
 as


it's
 been
 right.
 Pounce
 right
 there.


1944.
 Let's
 see.
 Can
 we
 get
 195?
 It


looks
 like
 she
 wants
 it.


It
 looks
 like
 she
 wants
 it.
 Resistance


on
 SPY
 690.
 I
 can
 check.


Um,
 we
 are
 really
 close
 to
 that.
 Nvidia


very
 close
 back
 to
 to
 uh
 to
 211.
 Who's


selling
 Palenteer?
 Is
 anyone
 selling


Palenteer
 today
 or
 are
 we
 all
 holding?


All
 right,
 you
 guys
 know
 my
 answer,
 but


I'm
 curious.
 Are
 people
 taking
 profits


here?
 I
 know
 it's
 tempting.
 I
 know
 it's


juicy.
 I
 just
 think
 even
 one
 of my


friends
 text
 me,
 she's
 like,
 "Bro,
 I'm


thinking
 of
 selling."
 I'm
 like, "Dude,


that's
 fine.
 You
 can
 sell."
 I
 would
 just


wait
 after
 earnings.
 I
 would
 just
 wait.


I
 would
 just
 wait.
 Like
 may
 maybe
 it


tanks
 10%
 on
 earnings
 and
 it's
 whatever,


right?
 But
 like
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 worth


waiting
 until
 after
 earnings
 if
 you're


going
 to
 sell.


I
 just
 again
 dude
 I
 just
 like
 that
 I


know
 outside
 of
 value
 there's
 not


outside
 of
 valuation
 which
 I
 understand


is
 aggressive
 there's
 not
 many
 things
 to


say
 are
 red
 flags
 especially
 when
 you


look
 at
 their
 operating
 margin
 growth


and
 you
 can
 you
 you
 know
 you
 can
 adjust


the
 numbers
 on
 DCF
 models
 if
 you


increase
 the
 margin
 inflection
 over
 the


next
 10
 years
 to
 really
 be
 able
 to
 say


it
 it
 could
 be
 worth
 the
 price
 that
 it's


worth
 today
 and
 as
 a
 result
 that's
 why


the
 street
 continues
 to
 give
 it
 a


premium
 ladies
 and
 gentlemen
 195
 on


Palunteer
 is
 officially
 here.


Congratulations
 to
 everybody


from
 $7
 to


195
 all-time
 highs
 on
 one
 of
 the


greatest
 stories
 in
 business
 history.


Pounder,
 congrats
 everybody.
 195


All
 right.
 So,
 200
 next.
 I
 mean,
 at
 this


point,
 you
 might
 as
 well
 just
 catch
 up


to
 Nvidia.
 You
 might
 as
 well
 just
 catch


up
 to
 Nvidia.


You
 might
 as
 well.
 I
 mean,
 let's
 check


196
 resistance.
 Let's
 check.
 So,
 it


busted
 through
 195.
 There
 was
 about


90,000
 shares
 waiting
 there.
 196
 is


7,000
 shares.
 That's
 not
 a
 lot.


7,000
 shares
 is
 not
 a
 lot
 to
 break


through.


Wow,
 this
 incredible.
 Love
 to
 fly,


pilot.
 Shout
 out
 to
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 Palunteer
 195.
 I
 see
 most
 of


people
 saying
 they're
 not
 thinking
 of
 of


selling.
 I
 mean,
 I
 get
 it.
 Especially,


look
 here,
 here's
 my
 other
 thing.
 If
 you


have
 a
 very
 uh
 strong
 margin
 of
 safety


here,
 you
 know,
 and
 you
 bought,
 I
 forget


$10,
 $20.
 If
 your
 average
 is
 like
 50
 or


70,
 you
 just
 have
 so
 much
 room
 for
 this


thing
 to
 fall
 and
 for
 you
 to
 still
 be


up,
 then
 maybe
 it
 doesn't
 make
 the
 most


sense
 to
 to
 trim
 and
 take
 because
 then


you
 have
 you
 have
 you
 have
 to


like
 I
 think
 you
 would
 sell
 pounder
 here


if
 you
 think
 it's
 it's
 unsustainable
 and


it's
 just
 going
 to
 drop
 from
 here,
 which


of
 course
 anything
 can
 happen
 to
 a
 stock


and
 it
 can
 drop.
 I
 just
 think
 the
 amount


and
 we've
 talked
 about
 this
 so
 much
 over


the
 past
 couple
 months.
 the
 amount
 of


liquidity
 in
 this
 name,
 the
 amount
 of


buyers
 in
 this
 name,
 the
 amount
 of


people
 that
 will
 dip
 by
 in
 this
 name,


the
 amount
 of
 growth
 they're
 showing,


that's
 getting
 the
 analysts
 to
 raise
 the


targets.
 If
 it
 falls
 aggressively,
 those


are
 dips
 that
 people
 will
 take
 advant


This
 is
 the
 only
 name
 in
 AI
 that's


growing
 50%.
 If
 we
 get
 anywhere
 near
 140


again,
 like
 we
 got
 in
 August
 after


Citron
 put
 out
 that
 research,
 which
 by


the
 way,
 where
 is
 Citron?


Do
 they
 still
 have
 the
 short?
 Because


they
 are
 officially
 underwater
 on
 the


short.
 They
 were
 underwater
 on
 the
 short


about
 $7
 ago,
 but
 like


I
 don't
 know
 where
 they
 are.
 Like
 like


if
 we
 get
 that
 level
 of
 a
 dip
 again,


which
 I
 think
 would
 be
 a
 broad
 market


based
 dip,
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 dip
 you
 buy.


There's
 not
 that
 many
 quality
 companies


out
 there
 that
 can
 grow
 with
 the
 margins


that
 Pounder
 can
 grow
 at.


And
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 uh
 that's
 why
 I


think
 I
 I
 don't
 know.
 I'm
 not
 selling.


At least
 I
 I
 I
 everyone
 can
 do
 what
 they


want
 to
 do.
 But
 I
 really
 do
 think
 after


earnings
 and
 if
 it
 dumps
 on
 earnings,


okay,
 like
 if
 the
 earnings
 are
 great
 and


it
 dumps,
 then
 gives
 you
 another


opportunity.
 Worst
 case,
 you
 sell
 some


calls
 against
 Paler
 premiums
 are


amazing.
 Pal
 has
 some
 of the
 best
 call


premiums
 in
 the
 market.
 Even
 if
 you
 go


far
 out
 of
 the
 money.
 So
 if
 you
 really


want
 to
 milk
 something
 off
 the
 shares


like
 selling
 the
 calls
 against
 it
 also


is
 not
 the
 craziest
 thing
 to
 do.
 195


still
 right
 there
 on
 pounder.
 AMD
 26.


That's
 basically
 alltime
 highs
 on
 AMD


267
 just
 below
 that.
 NF
 still
 down.


Pinterest
 is
 down
 a
 little
 bit.
 Circle


down
 a little
 bit.
 Where's
 Rocket
 Lab


today?
 Rocket
 Lab
 is
 up
 1.42%.
 Oscar
 is


up
 1.323%.


Lemonade
 is
 flat.
 And
 then
 UNH
 got


upgraded
 to
 408
 today.
 UNH
 right
 there


364.
 That
 one's
 also
 down.


UNH
 is
 down.


Um,
 couple
 things
 from
 Bank
 of
 Canada.


They
 said,
 "We
 feel
 that
 we
 are
 at
 the


right
 level.
 We
 feel
 if
 the
 outlook


changes,
 we
 are
 prepared
 to
 respond."


And
 on
 Trump,
 they
 said, "The
 weekend


events
 remind
 us
 that
 trade
 policy
 is


unpredictable."
 Okay,
 so
 they're


basically
 saying,
 "We
 didn't
 expect
 the


Trump
 tweet
 about
 the
 Reagan
 stuff,
 but


we
 understand
 it
 could
 be
 unpredictable.


We
 got
 some
 bullish
 option
 flow
 on


Nvidia.
 $18
 million


of
 call
 options
 were
 purchased
 for
 the


235
 strike
 for
 Nvidia
 December
 19th.


December
 19th,
 235.


That
 was
 your
 strike.
 18
 million.


Someone
 just
 bought.
 Could
 be
 someone.


It
 could
 be
 a
 hedge
 fund.
 It
 could
 be


money
 manager.
 But
 there
 was
 the
 option


flow
 of
 that
 much
 money.
 Micron
 right


there
 232.


Micron
 right
 there
 232.
 That's
 up
 4.5%.


4.5%.
 That
 is
 also
 green.
 Um,
 Paler.


Wow.
 She's
 trying
 to
 move
 to
 136
 or
 196.


She
 is
 trying
 to
 move
 to
 196.


Oh,
 man.
 She's
 moving
 19550.
 19570.


Oh,
 she's
 moving.
 Someone's
 buying
 heavy


right
 there.


Someone
 is
 buying.
 They
 don't
 care.
 They


are
 buying
 more.


They
 are
 buying
 more.
 Grab
 just
 went


green.
 Google's
 still
 green.
 Adobe
 CEO


is
 on
 CNBC.
 We'll
 go
 to
 him
 in
 a
 bit
 and


see
 how
 he's
 explaining
 kind
 of
 what's


going
 on
 with
 his
 company.
 Hood
 just


went
 green
 as
 well.
 146.
 I
 mean,
 it


looks
 like
 Hood
 wants
 to
 get
 back
 to
 150


as
 well.


She's
 going
 for
 196.
 She's
 going
 for
 it.


19592.


There's
 only
 7,000
 shares.
 There
 it
 is.


196.


196.


Wow.


Wow.
 That's
 like


I
 mean


I'm
 a
 bit
 speechless
 here.
 I'm
 a
 bit


speechless.


196
 on
 Palunteer.


I'm
 literally
 looking
 at
 the
 the
 the
 the


the
 price
 right
 now
 and
 just
 imagining


all
 those
 streams
 where
 we
 were
 looking


at
 it
 and
 it
 was
 87
 bucks
 and
 it's
 just


like
 it's
 it's it's
 it's
 been
 quite
 the


journey.
 196.
 It's
 definitely
 having
 a


bit
 of
 a
 delayed
 reaction
 from
 that


Jensen
 partnership
 yesterday
 with


Nvidia.
 I
 mean,
 that
 was
 a
 big
 deal.


Stock
 didn't
 react
 too
 much
 yesterday.


It
 is
 obviously
 reacting
 today.
 I
 think


it's
 about
 to
 go
 for
 197,
 folks.


1967.


Hood
 back
 over
 147.
 Well,
 let
 me
 check


resistance
 at
 197.
 Dude,
 no
 one's


working
 today.
 No
 one's
 working
 today,


that's
 for
 sure.


197
 12,000
 shares.
 12,000
 shares.


Oracle's
 dumping.
 Why
 is
 Oracle
 Oracle's


been
 weird
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks?


Oracle,
 Wow,
 it's
 down
 3%.


There
 might
 be
 a
 headline
 on
 Oracle
 that


we
 got
 to
 look
 at.
 Uh
 SoFi
 also
 goes


red.
 3132.


Um
 Rocket
 Lab
 still
 green.


Benny
 said,
 "I
 try
 not
 to
 work
 every


day,
 but
 don't
 tell
 anybody."
 Bounty


right
 there.
 19650.


We're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 labor


market
 in
 a
 bit
 because
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


stuff
 to
 discuss
 in
 in
 in
 in
 regards
 to


what's
 going
 on
 with
 the
 labor
 market,


but
 it
 is
 hard
 to
 work
 on
 a
 day
 like


this.
 Guys,
 it's
 not
 even
 10
 a.m.
 It's


not
 even
 10:00
 a.m.,
 bro.
 It
 hasn't
 even


been
 30
 minutes
 since
 the
 market
 opened.


BMR
 5137.


I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 getting


annoyed
 at
 Bit
 Mine,
 but
 I
 mean,


realistically,
 you
 shouldn't
 be
 annoyed


at
 BitMine.
 You
 should
 be
 annoyed
 at


Ethereum.
 Now,
 is
 there
 a
 reason
 to
 be


annoyed
 at
 Ethereum?
 Not
 really
 because


all
 the
 updates
 that
 we're
 seeing
 in


regards
 to
 stable
 coins,
 tokenization,


everything
 is
 happening
 in
 the
 right


direction.
 It's
 just
 it's
 not


necessarily
 affecting
 Ethereum's
 price


right
 now.
 Tom
 Lee,
 there
 were
 some


rumors
 yesterday
 he
 bought
 113
 million


of
 Ethereum
 based
 on
 some
 of
 the


addresses
 that
 are
 uh
 are
 are
 tracked


with
 Bitmine.


But
 it's
 more
 so
 just
 a
 question
 of
 when


Ethereum
 can
 uh
 can
 make
 its
 move.


Rio
 says,
 "Days
 like
 this
 I
 can
 work


faster
 with
 a
 smile."


Yeah,
 this
 is
 pretty
 incredible.


This
 is
 pretty
 incredible.


What
 do
 you
 use
 to
 look
 at
 resistance?


So,
 I
 use
 Robin
 Hood.
 Again,
 this
 is


available
 on
 other
 uh
 websites,
 but
 if


you
 go
 to
 Robin
 Hood,
 if
 you
 press
 the


yellow
 button
 near
 the
 share
 price
 on


mobile
 on
 on
 desktop,
 you
 have
 to
 press


the
 another
 button
 to
 open
 up
 the


settings,
 then
 you
 can
 see
 what
 it
 looks


like.
 So,
 if
 you're
 seeing
 it
 right


here,


it'll
 show
 you.
 It's
 not
 perfect,
 but


it'll
 show
 you
 how
 many
 shares
 are
 being


are
 waiting
 to
 be
 sold
 and
 bought.
 As


you
 can
 see,
 at
 197,
 there's
 about


11,000
 shares,


which
 is
 just
 not
 a
 ton
 of
 shares.
 And


that
 means
 we
 might
 have
 a
 shot
 to
 get
 a


bit
 higher,
 dude.
 And
 then
 again,
 you


got
 X
 and
 Trump
 meeting
 tomorrow


morning.
 That's
 also
 going
 to
 be
 really


important.
 Any
 good
 news
 on
 that?
 That


could
 just
 help
 the
 markets.
 Also,
 we


got
 this
 rate
 cut
 coming
 up
 in
 two


hours.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know if
 that's
 baked


in.
 Do
 people
 think
 the
 rate
 cuts
 B
 like


689
 on
 the
 S&P?
 Is
 the
 rate
 cut
 baked
 in


right
 now?
 Is
 it
 baked
 in
 or
 no?
 Or
 do


we
 think
 we're
 going
 higher
 once
 JPA


officially
 says
 we're
 cutting
 rates?


I
 kind
 of
 think
 some
 of
 it's
 baked
 in,


but
 I
 also
 think
 once
 it's
 officially


announced,
 the
 market
 will
 have
 a
 better


way
 to
 interpret
 the
 reaction.
 Let's


look
 at
 the
 heat
 map
 on
 what
 we've
 got


going
 on.


Yeah,
 it's
 kind
 of
 mixed,
 guys.
 Nvidia


obviously
 glowing
 green.
 Apple
 green,


Amazon
 slightly
 green,
 Google
 green,


everything
 else
 is
 kind
 of
 red.


Maybe
 the
 rate
 cuta
 doesn't
 help
 Nvidia,


but
 it
 helps
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 stocks.
 Like


a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies
 have
 debt,


right?
 If
 you
 cut
 rates,
 they
 can


refinance
 their
 debt.
 So
 that
 that


starts
 to
 get
 factored
 into
 their


expenses
 uh
 as
 as
 a
 percentage
 of
 the


overall
 revenues,
 but
 you
 need
 the


official
 confirmation
 of
 that
 rate
 cut


for
 it
 to
 happen.
 The
 cruise
 lines
 are
 a


great
 example
 of
 this.
 So
 are
 the


telecommunication
 companies.
 So,


we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 when
 JPAL


officially
 says
 it,
 how
 the
 market


reacts.
 Almost
 690
 on
 the
 S&P.


Quantum's
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 QBTS
 D-Wave


is
 up
 3.9.
 Oio
 Q
 is
 up
 3.3
 and
 then


Regetti


is
 up
 3816
 that's
 up
 2.9%.
 Nvidia
 back


to
 211.
 Palanteer
 trying
 to
 push
 19650.


Jensen
 did
 spend
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 time


talking
 about
 quantum
 yesterday.
 The


idea
 was
 that
 we
 could
 have
 a
 hybrid


solution
 between
 GPUs
 and
 QPUs.


And
 yeah,
 it
 was
 it
 was
 definitely
 a


tone
 switch
 from
 what
 he
 talked
 about
 um


eight
 months
 ago,
 but
 it
 seems
 like
 in


general
 it's
 productive
 for
 the
 entire


quantum
 sector
 and
 that's
 why
 some
 of


those
 names
 are
 catching
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 bid.


19660


on
 Nvidia.
 Better.
 How's
 that
 one
 doing?


Better.
 that
 is
 up
 about
 2%.
 Again,


rates
 coming
 down
 should
 be
 good
 for
 the


rocket
 mortgage,
 better
 mortgage


companies
 of
 the
 world.
 ASTS
 that's


still
 up
 5%.
 Micro
 Strategy,
 that's


flat.
 Uber's
 down.
 Roblox
 up
 a
 little


bit.
 And then
 the
 Q's
 are
 up
 half%.
 Wow.


Nvidia
 212,
 bro.


Oh
 my
 goodness,
 dude.


Guys,
 it's
 either
 retail
 or
 it's
 either


a
 massive
 set
 of
 institutional
 investors


that
 have
 just
 said,
 "We
 don't
 care.


we're
 buying


and
 they're
 buying
 Nvidia
 and
 they're


buying
 pounder


it's
 either
 retail
 or
 it's
 either
 a
 lot


of
 hedge
 funds
 money
 man
 you
 know
 what


it
 is
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 we've
 been
 talking


about
 this
 for
 a
 while
 it
 could
 be
 these


these
 fund
 managers
 that
 have
 missed


their
 bench
 I
 mean
 imagine
 if
 you're
 a


fund
 manager
 you're
 underperforming
 you


missed
 April
 you
 missed
 August
 and


September
 we
 did
 have
 a
 1%
 dip
 then
 you


missed
 October
 10th
 you
 missed
 the
 3%


dip
 now
 you
 throw
 in
 the
 towel
 you
 say


you
 know
 what
 all
 right
 Jensen
 said
 500


billion
 I
 got
 to
 buy.
 I
 have
 to
 buy.
 And


the
 fact
 that
 211
 theoretically
 could
 be


cheap
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year,


which
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 say
 that,
 but
 like


if
 we
 do
 get
 a
 move
 to
 225
 or
 something


like
 that.
 I
 mean,
 like
 that
 would
 be
 a


good
 buy,
 right?
 So,
 the
 fact
 that
 that


could
 happen
 is
 quite
 incredible.
 No
 way


this
 is
 retail
 volume
 on
 Nvidia
 89


million.
 Palanteer
 12.
 Dude,
 pound


that's
 not
 even
 a
 lot
 of
 volume
 for


Palanteer.


I
 mean,
 that's
 good
 volume,
 but
 that's


not
 like
 crazy
 crazy
 volume
 or
 anything.


So
 for
 Palenters,
 just
 a
 lot
 of
 buy


orders
 that
 are
 coming
 in.
 By
 the
 way,


yesterday
 5
 million
 contracts
 were


traded
 for
 Nvidia
 in
 the
 options
 market.


SoFi
 had
 1.4
 million.
 Beyond
 Meat
 at


955,000.
 Where
 is
 Beyond
 Meat
 today?


Beyond
 Meat
 is
 down
 2%.


So
 you
 obviously
 had
 a
 lot
 of


option
 activity
 on
 some
 of
 these
 names.


Um,
 okay.
 We
 got
 pending
 home
 sales.
 Let


me
 pull
 this
 up.
 We
 got
 pending
 home


sales.
 Let's
 take
 a
 look
 at
 some
 of
 this


data


and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


All right,
 here
 we
 go.


>> First
 though,
 let's
 get
 some
 housing


data
 with
 Diana.
 Morning,
 Diana.


>> Good
 morning,
 Carl.
 Pending
 home
 sales


in
 September
 were
 unchanged
 from
 August


and
 dropped.9%
 year-over-year.
 That


according
 to
 the
 National
 Association
 of


Realtors,
 the
 street
 was
 looking
 for
 a


1%
 gain
 after
 an
 even
 larger
 gain
 in


August.
 Now,
 this
 count
 is
 based
 on


signed
 contracts.
 So,
 people
 out


shopping
 in
 September
 and
 making
 that


decision
 when
 the
 average
 rate
 on
 the


30-year
 fix
 was
 generally
 on
 the


decline,
 but
 had
 not
 dropped
 as
 much
 as


it
 did
 this
 month.
 So,
 it
 was
 between


6.4
 and
 6.5%
 versus
 today's
 6.1%.
 Now,


regionally,
 sales
 rose
 in
 the
 Northeast


and
 South,
 but
 fell
 in
 the
 Midwest
 and


West.
 Inventory
 has
 climbed
 to
 a
 5-year


high,
 although
 still
 on
 the
 lean
 side


historically.
 The
 Realtor's
 chief


economist,
 Lawrence
 Yun,
 noted
 in
 the


release
 that
 a
 record
 high
 stock
 market


and
 growing
 housing
 wealth
 in
 September


were
 not
 enough
 to
 offset
 a
 likely


softening
 job
 market.
 Carl,


>> Diana,
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about
 that
 and


how
 it
 relates
 to
 the
 Fed
 in
 a
 minute.


Thank
 you,
 Diana
 Ol.
 Uh,
 stocks
 meantime


sitting
 at
 record
 highs
 as
 we
 said
 as
 we


await
 three
 of
 the
 mag
 seven
 earnings


numbers
 this
 afternoon
 along
 with
 the


Fed
 decision
 and
 the
 news
 conference.


Joining
 us
 here
 at
 Post
 9
 this
 morning


is
 Muhammad
 Ali,
 of
 course,
 Alian's


chief
 econ.


>> Okay,
 so
 pending
 home
 sales
 not
 as
 uh
 as


bad
 as
 expected,
 relatively
 decent.


Looks
 like
 the
 housing
 market
 is


starting
 to
 open
 up
 a
 bit
 more.
 Um


Nvidia
 still
 pushing,
 pounder
 still


pushing
 as
 well.
 19640
 got
 to
 19680
 and


you
 got
 Nvidia
 just
 below
 212.


Just
 below
 212.
 Imagine
 what
 bad
 news


would
 do
 to
 this
 euphoria.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 well,
 if
 it
 is


euphoria,
 it's
 in
 two
 names,
 at least


today,
 which
 is
 Nvidia
 and
 Paler.
 I


mean,
 you're
 not
 really
 seeing
 it


broadly
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 stocks


are
 red.


I
 mean,
 I
 would
 say
 uh
 JPAL
 back
 in


August
 in
 that
 pivot
 that
 he
 made
 was


more
 euphoric
 because
 everything
 went


green.
 I
 mean,
 last
 Friday
 it
 was
 more


euphoric.
 Everything
 was
 green.
 Today


it's
 a
 couple
 names
 which
 maybe
 allows


it
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 isolated
 to
 a
 few
 names


that
 you
 know
 the
 streets
 really


expecting
 strong
 growth
 out
 of.
 Fear
 and


greed
 we're
 officially
 at
 neutral
 folks.


We're
 officially
 at
 neutral.
 All right.


So
 that
 is
 starting
 to
 show
 you
 that
 at


least
 from
 one
 indicator
 the
 market
 is


beginning
 to
 think
 things
 are
 getting
 a


bit
 elevated
 even
 if
 it's
 only
 in
 a


couple
 names
 but
 those
 couple
 names


control
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 S&P
 and
 that's
 why


the
 S&P
 is
 hitting
 alltime
 highs.


Um


82%
 of
 you
 by
 the
 way
 said
 we
 would
 end


green
 on
 the
 day.


Nvidia
 bit
 of
 a
 red
 candle
 but
 still


holding
 210
 in
 Palter
 still
 pushing
 for


197.
 She
 still
 wants
 it.
 Most
 of
 the


semis
 are
 up.


Uh
 sounds
 right.
 There's
 greed
 in
 tech


but
 not
 anywhere
 else.
 Yeah,
 exactly.


That's
 that
 that's
 exactly
 what
 I'm


trying
 to
 say.
 There's
 greed
 in
 tech
 but


not
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 places.
 I
 mean


him.
 Dude,
 this
 has
 been
 a
 disaster
 to


this
 freaking
 stock.
 This
 is
 sentiment


on
 HIMS
 has
 been
 horrible.
 And
 I
 still


think
 they're
 cheap,
 but
 you
 got
 these


uh
 Bank
 of
 America
 reports
 coming
 out
 on


their
 credit
 card
 uh
 uh
 estimates
 and


they're
 saying,
 "Hey,
 like
 third
 quarter


is
 just
 going
 to
 miss
 pretty
 bad.
 Alpha


is
 down

 A
 lot
 of
 the

 are
 getting

 Salesforce

down.
 PayPal
 unfortunately

 not


hold
 the

 from

 Reddit


down

 Bloom

 up.
 Duolingo


and
 Adobe
 just
 getting
 wrecked.
 These


two
 stock
 I
 mean
 this
 in
 my
 Dualingo
 uh


deep
 dive
 for
 my
 Substack.
 I'll
 link
 it


right
 here
 in
 the
 chat
 for
 those
 that


want
 to
 read
 it.
 Uh
 the
 last
 thing
 I


said
 was
 that
 the
 reason
 I
 can't
 buy
 it.


Although
 I
 really
 after
 doing
 the
 deep


dive,
 I
 really
 do
 think
 there's
 a
 moat


to
 the
 company
 in
 regards
 to
 the


proprietary
 data
 advantage
 they
 have


around
 language,
 but
 I
 can't
 buy
 it


because
 like
 the
 narrative
 is
 bad.
 And


it's
 like
 there's
 always
 going
 to
 be a


narrative
 with
 your
 stock
 that
 you
 have


to
 deal
 with.
 There's
 always
 going
 to
 be


the
 question
 is
 how
 much
 do
 you
 want
 to


deal
 with
 with
 the
 narrative?
 And
 with


Dual
 Lingo,
 I
 don't know
 if
 I
 want
 to


deal
 with
 the
 language
 learning


narrative
 being
 commoditized
 by
 AI
 for


the
 long
 term.
 Dude,

 Like
 once

 That's
 not


that
 far.


probably
 going
 to

 the

 though.
 I


mean,
 like,
 it's
 open

 right?


I
 would
 be
 curious
 about
 their
 numbers,


dude.
 I
 wonder
 if
 they
 would
 get
 to


profitability
 before
 uh
 before
 2027.


It's
 hard
 to
 imagine
 they
 would,
 but


you're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 people


buying
 into
 that
 IPO.
 And
 I
 really


wonder
 what
 that
 means
 for
 the
 broader


market.


But
 again,
 OpenAI
 is
 tied
 to
 Broadcom,


Nvidia,
 Oracle,
 AMD.
 Like,
 OpenAI
 has
 to


win.
 No
 matter
 how
 much
 you
 like
 them
 or


don't
 like,
 they
 have
 to
 win
 because
 so


much
 AI
 is
 connected
 to
 them.
 So
 it
 will


be
 important.

Palanteer?


Those
 have
 been
 the
 famous
 last
 words


for
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 I
 mean,
 dude,


remember
 when
 we
 had
 the
 Bearcave
 who


came
 on
 the
 channel
 uh
 back
 when
 Pounder


was
 14
 bucks
 and
 I
 debated
 him
 and
 uh


you
 know,
 his
 argument
 was,
 "Well,
 my


friend's
 telling
 me
 that
 Pounder
 is
 a


consulting
 firm."
 I
 was
 like, "What


friends?
 Who
 are
 these
 like
 very


important
 people
 in
 Silicon
 Valley?"
 I


was
 like,
 "Dude,
 who
 the
 [ __ ]
 like
 like


is
 this
 really
 your
 argument?"
 I
 was


like,
 "You
 really
 came
 to
 a
 debate


saying
 that?"


And
 like
 you
 know
 from
 that
 to
 then


Citron
 to
 like
 it's
 just
 it's
 pounder


has
 defied
 every
 expectation
 because


they've
 just
 kept
 pushing
 through


and
 they
 you
 know
 they
 put
 up
 the
 growth


which
 is
 what
 matters.

 We
 did
 that
 interview
 back


in
 2023.
 That
 was
 May
 of
 23.


And
 you
 guys
 know
 me,
 you
 know,
 you
 know


I
 I
 did
 debate
 in
 high
 school,
 so
 I
 love


a
 good
 debate.
 And
 uh
 I
 always
 salivate


to
 get
 into
 a
 debate.
 So,
 you
 know,
 he


wrote
 this
 article
 and
 this
 article
 went


viral.
 It
 was
 obviously
 to
 promote
 a


Substack.
 I
 mean,
 he
 picked
 pounder
 as


an
 easy
 target,
 but
 like
 he
 legit,
 like


when
 I
 said,
 "Yo,
 you
 want
 to
 come
 on


the
 channel
 and
 talk
 about
 it?"
 He
 was


so
 excited
 because
 he
 knew
 he
 would
 get


so
 much
 more
 attention
 and
 people
 would


subscribe
 to
 a
 Substack.


And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 you
 can
 be


excited
 to
 come
 on
 the
 channel.
 Just


just
 realize."
 And
 in
 my
 head,
 I'm
 like,


"Bro,
 you're
 gonna
 get
 obliterated
 if


you
 like,
 this
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 a
 fun


experience
 for
 you."
 I
 think
 he
 was


thinking
 it
 was
 gonna
 be
 a
 friendly


discussion.
 I
 like,
 "No,
 bro.
 Like,
 this


is
 like
 you're
 taking
 a
 shot
 at
 the


whole
 community
 here.
 Like,
 we're
 going


to
 really
 dive
 into
 it."
 And
 I
 I
 think


it
 was
 an
 entertaining
 experience,
 to


say
 the
 least.
 I
 mean,
 the
 first


question
 we
 asked
 was
 like, "What's
 an


ontology?"
 And
 he
 was
 like, "What
 is


that?"
 I
 was
 like, "How
 are
 you
 saying


short
 pounder?
 You
 don't
 know
 the
 core


architecture.
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 know


every
 technical
 I
 don't
 know
 every


technical
 nuance
 of
 an
 ontology
 but
 like


you
 got
 to
 know
 what
 the
 point
 of
 the


ontology
 is
 in
 Paler
 Software.
 And
 he


was
 like
 what
 are
 you
 talking
 about?
 I


was
 like
 oh
 this
 is
 this
 is
 fresh
 meat.


This
 is

 here.

 Let's
 go


to

 Pounder
 is
 helping


me,
 but
 Dolingo
 is
 probably
 hurting
 me


bad.
 Um,


well,
 we're
 we're

 Matt's

 I'm
 at

 Steve's


at

 is

So,
 Matt's
 at

 I'm
 at

 was
 the

 in
 the

draft


at

 I'm

 "I'm
 I'm

I
 am

 Yeah,
 they


had
 a
 good
 earnings
 yesterday.

That's
 why
 that
 stock
 right
 here
 is
 up

 Wow.
 I
 didn't
 know
 it
 was
 up
 16.
 It


was
 up
 10%
 yesterday.
 Look
 at
 that.

 in
 the

That
 one
 getting

 right


here.
 And
 that's
 green.
 Cheesecake
 is


down.
 Cheesecake

 I


don't
 know
 if
 that
 means
 they
 deserve
 to


go
 down
 7%
 5%
 right
 here,
 but
 they
 are


down.
 They
 did
 beat
 on
 EPS


which
 was
 important.
 Bloom
 Energy,
 they


crushed

 as
 well.
 Uh
 what's
 his


name?
 Uh
 Chris
 Camilillo
 is
 long.
 Bloom


Energy.
 Chris
 Camilillo
 23.
 Goodness


gracious.
 23%.


They
 had
 a
 good
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the


bottom.
 I
 think
 they
 probably
 said


something
 in
 guidance
 around
 data
 center


space
 which
 is
 why
 they're
 really


getting
 a
 move.


But
 he
 also
 is
 now
 long
 this

Rubric's

 Oh,
 folks.


We

 We
 got

for

That's
 That's
 a
 big
 move.
 That's

 big


198
 has
 37,000
 shares.


198
 is
 37,000
 shares.


We're
 going
 to
 ring
 the
 bell
 again
 at


200.
 Remember,
 with
 Pounder,
 it's


increments
 of
 five.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to


see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 that
 200
 to
 ring
 the


bell.
 But
 197


197
 is
 such
 a
 sexy
 number,
 too,
 dude.


Like
 the
 seven
 makes
 the
 one
 and
 the


nine
 looks
 so
 nice
 together.
 Like,
 look


at
 that,
 dude.
 19.
 That's
 crazy,
 bro.


That's
 crazy.
 All right,
 the
 same


question
 I
 ask
 every
 time
 we
 get
 to


these
 big
 levels
 on
 pound
 chair.
 Who's


feeling
 nervous?
 Who's
 feeling
 excited?


Nervous
 or
 excited?
 What
 do
 you
 think?


Put
 in
 the
 chat.
 Nervous
 or
 excited?


Admit
 we'll
 get
 thrown
 out
 of
 the


apartment
 because
 the
 bell
 today.
 Yeah,


exactly.
 Exactly.


I'm
 not
 that
 nervous,
 bro.
 It's
 more


excitement
 for
 me.
 And
 and
 and
 this
 is
 a


contrast
 to
 how
 I
 felt
 about
 Pounder
 at


other
 times
 when
 it
 hit
 all-time
 highs.


I
 felt
 a
 bit
 more
 nervous
 than
 excited.


I
 am
 feeling
 the
 most
 confident
 I
 have


ever
 felt
 about
 this
 company.
 And
 it's


really
 easy
 to
 feel
 confident
 when
 you


see
 these
 types
 of
 partnerships
 with


Nvidia,
 but
 you
 also
 know
 the
 earnings


growth
 is
 coming.


So,
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 like
 the
 stock
 could
 go


back
 down
 to
 190.
 It
 is
 what
 it
 like


that's
 you
 know
 the
 stocks
 go
 up
 and


down
 but
 this
 is
 not
 super
 super
 scary


or
 nerve-wracking
 for
 me.
 This
 is
 this


is
 something
 I
 kind
 of
 thought
 over
 the


past
 couple
 weeks
 like
 we
 would
 start
 to


make
 this
 type
 of
 run
 just
 given
 we
 were


getting
 into
 earnings.


These
 numbers
 should
 be
 good.
 19724


nervous
 about
 my
 covered
 calls.
 Okay,


that's
 you
 can
 definitely
 be
 nervous


about
 that.
 That's
 fair.
 Um


pounders
 PE
 is
 very
 high.
 I
 agree.
 It


has
 always
 been
 very
 high.
 It's
 just
 one


of
 those
 things
 that
 again
 if
 like
 again


Citron
 the
 reason
 they
 short
 it
 was


because
 the
 PE
 that
 was
 their
 whole


research
 report.
 It's
 like
 I
 don't
 know


if
 that's
 the
 only
 way
 you
 can
 use
 the
 I


mean
 same
 thing
 with
 quantum
 right
 it's


like
 just
 because
 the
 valuation
 is


aggressive
 which
 I
 think
 the
 valuation


is
 really
 aggressive
 on
 those
 names
 that


doesn't
 mean
 it's
 a
 good
 short
 it
 just


doesn't


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 going
 for
 the


sector
 that
 that
 that
 require
 not
 or


that
 that
 would
 think
 you
 should


probably
 not
 short
 it
 and
 with
 pounder


forget
 things
 going
 good
 for
 the
 AI


sector
 pounder
 is
 actually
 growing
 in


that
 sector


oh
 my
 goodness
 is
 it
 going
 for
 198
 8.
 It


hit
 19780.


19780.


Dude,
 we
 were
 also
 talking
 last
 week


about
 the
 190
 option
 flow.
 Remember
 the


December
 190
 calls?
 We
 we
 flagged
 it
 on


the
 on
 the
 channel.
 We
 said
 there
 was
 a


lot
 of
 money
 going
 into
 those.
 So,
 you


did
 have
 someone
 thinking
 that
 a
 190


move
 was
 going
 to
 happen
 and
 those
 are


now
 deep
 in
 the
 money.


Deep
 in
 the
 money.
 Did
 you
 see
 Skrey


versus
 Shay?
 Yes.
 Shade
 did
 not
 do
 the


best
 job
 in
 that
 debate
 and
 he
 wasn't


able
 to
 defend
 quantum
 as
 a
 industry
 as


well.
 That
 doesn't
 mean
 it's
 a
 short.
 I


know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 wanted
 to
 short


after
 watching
 that,
 but
 that
 doesn't


necessarily
 mean
 you
 short
 just
 because


someone
 doesn't
 do
 the
 best
 job


defending,
 you
 know,
 an
 industry
 in


debate.


But
 this
 is
 pretty
 incredible
 to
 see.


Let's
 get
 an
 update
 right
 here
 on
 Nvidia


and
 the
 move
 that
 we
 saw
 yesterday
 and


uh
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


club.
 President
 Trump
 telling
 reporters


just
 uh
 overnight
 that
 he
 would
 bring
 up


quote
 super
 duper
 blackwell
 chips
 with


President
 Xi
 in
 trade
 talks
 and
 that


definitely
 helped
 the
 stock
 momentum


today.
 But
 the
 stock
 really
 moved
 on


revenue
 visibility.
 Yesterday,
 Nvidia's


CEO
 pointed
 to
 $500
 billion
 in


cumulative
 data
 center
 revenue
 for
 2025


and
 2026.
 That
 number
 really
 surprised
 a


lot
 of
 the
 street
 because
 it
 runs
 at


least
 about
 10%
 I've
 seen
 even
 some


estimates
 20%
 higher
 than
 their
 current


estimates.
 That's
 significant
 upside
 and


why
 you're
 seeing
 so
 many
 upgrades
 this


morning.
 For
 example,
 Melia
 is
 bumping


their
 price
 target
 to
 $300
 from$275.


Goldman
 sees
 further
 upside
 from
 OpenAI


deployments,
 sovereign
 government
 deals,


and
 of
 course
 the
 timing
 of
 the
 Rubid


chip
 launch,
 which
 is
 the
 next


architecture
 for
 their
 GPUs.
 Now,
 on


that
 China
 angle,
 CEO
 Johnson
 Wong
 told


me
 on
 CNBC
 yesterday
 that
 only
 Trump
 can


solve
 the
 trade
 impass.
 He
 even
 ended


his
 speech
 yesterday
 with
 make
 America


great
 again.
 Wall
 Street
 currently


models
 zero
 zero
 China
 revenue
 following


export
 bans.
 So
 any
 deal
 would
 represent


upside
 not
 priced
 in.
 Nvidia
 is
 now


worth
 more
 than
 all
 of
 the
 S&P
 500


energy,
 real
 estate
 and
 material
 stocks


combined.
 This
 according
 to
 uh
 just
 our


data
 desk
 here.
 The
 stock
 is
 up
 roughly


56%
 year-to
 date,
 but
 has
 lagged
 other


AI
 names
 like
 Broadcom
 and
 Oracle
 as


investors
 do
 worry
 about
 bubble
 talk.


But
 hyperscalers
 report
 over
 the
 next
 48


hours
 or
 I
 should
 say
 some
 of
 them
 even


tonight
 which
 could
 provide
 further


catalyst
 if
 AI
 spending
 commentary
 stays


strong.
 Guys,


>> Christina,
 you
 know,

 know,
 you
 know,
 Jensen
 saying
 make


America
 great
 again
 yesterday.
 That
 was


a
 nod
 to
 Trump
 and
 Trump
 hears


everything,
 dude.
 If
 you
 know
 anything


about
 Trump,
 he
 listens
 and
 hears


everything.
 So,
 the
 fact
 that
 Jensen
 put


GTC
 in
 DC
 was
 a
 nod
 to
 this


administration.
 And
 you
 know,
 whether


you
 like
 or
 hate
 Trump,
 and
 I
 don't
 even


know
 if
 Jensen
 loves
 or
 hates
 Trump,
 I


know
 that
 Jensen
 loves
 the
 agenda
 of


American
 manufacturing
 and
 American


national
 security
 when
 it
 comes
 to


semiconductors.
 And
 that
 is
 really
 what


he's
 gearing
 himself
 towards.
 So
 by


saying
 that
 yesterday
 and
 by
 hosting
 it


in
 DC,
 you
 know,
 you
 got
 Trump
 feeling
 a


lot
 more
 in
 line
 with
 this
 idea
 of


exporting
 American
 technology,


infrastructure,
 software,
 hardware
 to


the
 rest
 of
 the
 world.
 One
 of
 those


parts
 of
 the
 world
 being
 China,
 which
 is


ready
 to
 spend,
 I
 think
 the
 the
 TAM


every
 year,
 Jensen
 said,
 is
 about
 50


billion
 on
 these
 Nvidia
 chips.


Which
 is
 why
 I
 think
 Nvidia
 is
 getting


the
 run
 because
 if
 that's
 not
 factored


in
 and
 that
 tomorrow
 we
 get
 an


announcement
 that
 says
 Trump
 finalizes


trade
 deal
 with
 China
 allows
 Nvidia
 AMD


to
 sell
 chips.
 I
 mean


you
 would
 imagine
 the
 excitement
 that


the
 market
 would
 have
 if
 that
 officially


is
 happening.
 Broadcom
 alltime
 highs


380.


Look
 at
 that.
 380.97
 on
 Broadcom
 and


then
 AMD
 basically
 at
 all
 time
 highs
 at


264.
 All
 the
 semis
 really
 getting
 some


love
 right
 there.


Palinger
 at
 197.


the
 art
 of
 the
 glaze.
 I
 mean,
 yeah,
 you


know,
 there
 is
 always
 an
 art
 to
 the


glaze.
 But
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 if


you're
 a
 shareholder
 of
 Nvidia,
 you


know,
 you're
 a
 shareholder
 of
 any


company,
 you
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that


company's
 on
 the
 right
 side
 of
 the


administration.
 Why
 why
 would
 you
 want


them
 to
 be
 antagonistic
 with
 the


administration?
 And
 this
 is
 something


Jensen
 and
 Trump
 actually
 can
 agree
 on.


They
 don't
 have
 to
 agree
 on
 all
 the


other
 political
 issues,
 but
 they
 can


agree
 that
 American
 semiconductor


manufacturing
 matters.


And
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 Jensen
 has


aligned
 himself
 so
 deeply
 with
 Trump.


Amcore
 right
 there
 3322.
 That's
 up
 3.28%


as
 well.


Caterpillar
 up
 11%.
 Yep.
 Caterpillar


making
 a
 move
 again.
 They
 beat
 on
 the


top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 Shout
 out
 to


Douggee.
 He
 was
 in
 the
 chat
 about
 a


month
 ago
 speaking
 about
 Caterpillar
 and


how
 he
 thought
 it
 would
 be
 a
 bit
 more


vital
 in
 the
 data
 center
 space,


particularly
 around
 machinery.
 And


that's
 not
 the
 majority
 of
 their


business,
 but
 you're
 starting
 to
 see
 a


bit
 of
 earnings
 inflection
 from
 that.


Where's
 the
 VIX?


It's
 10:19.
 VIX
 is
 up
 3%.
 Okay,
 so
 the


VI,
 this
 is
 weird.
 The
 S&P
 is
 at
 all


time
 highs.
 The
 Vid
 is
 at
 all
 time
 highs


and
 the
 VIX
 is
 up
 3%.


So
 VIX
 might
 be
 signaling
 we're
 going
 to


get
 potentially
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 retracement


or
 you
 just
 might
 have
 some
 people


buying
 volatility
 as
 a
 hedge
 against
 the


broader
 market.


Nvidia
 is
 now
 the
 third
 richest
 country


in
 the
 world.


Dude,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy.


5.117


trillion.
 Apple's
 now
 the
 second
 largest


company,
 4.05
 trillion.


And
 BMR


goes
 down.


Ethereum,
 man,
 we
 need
 Ethereum
 to
 move.


We
 need
 it
 to
 move.
 Uh
 just
 got
 an


option
 flow
 on
 the
 S&P.
 Someone
 just


bought
 13
 million
 worth
 of
 puts
 on
 the


S&P.
 Strike
 is
 685.
 Strike
 is
 685.


13
 million
 of
 puts.
 Expiry
 is
 December


2025.


Expiry
 is
 December
 31st,
 2025.
 681
 is


the
 strike.
 13.4
 million.
 Um,
 and
 then


you
 got
 Micron.
 Someone
 bought
 235
 or
 n


$969,000
 worth
 of
 the
 235
 call
 expiring


November
 7th.


Trump
 will
 have
 his
 meeting
 at
 11
 a.m.


tomorrow
 in
 South
 Korea.
 Trump
 will
 have


his
 meeting
 at
 11:00
 a.m.
 in
 South


Korea.


Mike
 Johnson
 is
 live
 to
 talk
 about
 the


shutdown.
 We've
 uh
 we've
 already
 covered


a
 lot
 of
 what
 he's
 been
 saying
 on
 the


shutdown.
 Uh
 Oracle,
 I
 think
 I
 have
 an


update
 right
 here
 on
 Oracle.


Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.
 Is
 Oaklo


moving
 today?
 Oaklo.


Oaklo
 is
 moving.
 All right.
 All right.


So,
 the
 energy
 stocks
 from
 Bloom
 Energy


getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 right
 here
 and


that's
 helping.
 Um,


Oak
 looks
 like
 it's
 a
 debt
 issue.
 So,


Morgan
 Stanley
 says
 Oracle's
 net


adjusted
 debt
 could
 double
 to
 290


billion.
 Wow.
 Right
 now,
 they're
 at
 a


hundred
 billion.
 The
 cost
 to
 ensure


Oracle's
 debt
 is
 now
 its
 highest
 since


October
 2023.
 Morgan
 Stanley
 near-term


credit
 deterioration
 and
 uncertainty
 may


drive
 further
 bond
 holder
 and
 lender


hedging.


Okay,
 so
 that's
 why
 Oracle
 is
 down.
 The


streets
 basically
 afraid
 about
 debt
 and


wow,
 Oracle
 273
 down
 2.6.
 I
 mean,
 look,


they
 they
 took
 out
 40
 billion
 of


corporate
 bonds
 last
 last
 uh
 last
 week.


And
 as
 bullish
 as
 it
 was
 for
 the
 data


center
 space,
 it
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 debt
 that


they're
 putting
 on.


And
 so
 that
 could
 definitely
 be
 a
 bit


concerning.
 Now
 again,
 if
 the
 growth
 is


enough
 to
 overtake
 that,
 it
 doesn't


matter.
 But
 Morgan
 Stanley
 saying
 this


gonna
 be
 290
 billion
 of
 debt
 in
 four


years,


which
 is
 definitely
 something


aggressive.
 Fluence
 Energy,
 that
 one's


moving
 as
 well.
 Fluence,


yeah,
 look
 at
 that.
 Up
 11%.
 So,
 you
 got


a
 lot
 of
 these
 energy
 names
 based
 on


Bloom
 earnings
 that
 really
 are
 catching


a
 bid.
 Nvidia
 still
 holding
 210,
 Grab


now
 above
 six,


and
 then
 you
 got
 Pounder
 at
 19750.


Don't
 we
 care
 that
 OpenAI
 has
 a
 trillion


in
 debt?
 That's
 a
 good
 question
 because


they
 basically
 do
 have
 a
 trillion
 in


debt.


I
 guess
 I
 guess
 we
 don't
 care
 enough


about
 it.
 How
 the
 hell
 can
 the
 market
 be


simultaneously
 worried
 about
 data
 center


debt
 collapse
 and
 also
 pumping
 Nvidia


towards
 six
 trillion?
 See,
 it's
 a
 good


question.
 I
 don't
 fully
 have
 the
 answer


to
 that,
 but
 it's
 a
 good
 question.
 And


this
 is
 the
 diver.
 This
 is
 why
 my


portfolio
 has
 been
 heavy
 Nvidia
 and


basically
 zero
 exposure
 to
 any
 of
 the


other
 data
 center
 names,
 which
 I
 don't


know
 if
 that's
 going to
 be
 the
 same
 for


2026.
 I'm
 trying
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 due


diligence
 on
 the
 nebases,
 the
 core


reeves,
 the
 INS,
 all
 that
 stuff
 and


figure
 out
 if
 there's
 like
 a
 meaningful


opportunity
 after
 these
 stocks
 have


already
 5xed,
 right?
 You
 know,
 for
 those


that
 got
 in
 early,
 congrats.
 But
 I


didn't.
 But
 the
 one
 fear
 I've
 had
 is


that
 all
 those
 companies
 have
 different


operational
 challenges


that
 come
 down
 to
 either
 debt
 financing,


come
 down
 to
 vendor
 and
 distributor


relationships,
 come
 down
 to
 GPU


capacity,
 etc.
 Uh
 leasing,
 acquiring


land.
 Nvidia
 just
 has
 to
 make
 the
 GPUs.


I
 mean,
 Nvidia
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 challenges,


but
 at
 the
 end of
 the
 day,
 they
 are
 a


monopoly.
 And
 Google's
 trying
 to
 poke
 at


that
 monopoly
 with
 the
 TPUs,
 but
 for
 for


what
 it's
 worth,
 they're
 a
 monopoly.
 And


so,
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 other
 names,
 like,


you've
 got
 to
 get
 a
 good
 valuation
 on


them.
 I
 don't
 know if
 you
 could
 just


blindly
 buy
 them
 and
 just
 assume
 it's


going
 to
 go
 up
 with
 everything
 else.
 But


maybe
 you
 can.
 Maybe
 you
 can.
 But
 then


you
 get
 an
 Oracle
 headline
 like
 we're


getting
 right
 now
 that
 Morgan
 Stanley's


worried
 about
 debt.
 So,
 can
 you
 blindly


buy
 Oracle
 and
 just
 assume
 that


everything's
 going
 to
 be
 okay?
 I
 mean,


you
 could,
 but
 if
 you
 bought
 at
 350,


you're
 probably
 pissed
 off,
 right?
 I


don't
 know
 how
 easy
 it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 to


go
 from
 273
 to
 350.
 That's
 a
 hell
 of
 a


move.
 Remember,
 Oracle
 went
 from
 230
 to


350
 within
 like
 two
 days
 after
 those


earnings.


So,
 it's
 just
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where


it
 does
 require
 a
 little
 bit
 of


understanding
 of
 what
 exactly
 you're


buying
 and
 where
 you're
 buying
 it.


Poucher
 1979.
 We
 got
 close
 to
 198.


We
 got
 close
 to
 198.


Can
 you
 talk
 about
 layoffs?
 Yes,
 we're


going to
 talk
 about
 layups.
 We're
 going


to
 spend
 some
 time
 talking
 about


layoffs.
 Uh
 there's
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.


I
 actually
 did
 a
 decent
 amount
 of


research
 last
 night.
 Dude,
 last
 night


was
 crazy.
 Last
 night
 was
 crazy.
 I
 was


up
 till
 I
 thought
 I
 thought
 I
 would


sleep
 early
 last
 night.
 I
 wanted
 to


sleep
 at
 like
 10
 p.m.
 I
 ended
 up


sleeping
 at
 like
 12:30.
 I
 was
 up
 I
 was


in
 bed.
 I
 had
 my
 laptop.
 I
 was
 working.


I
 was
 looking
 at
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 layoff


videos
 trying
 to
 understand
 what's
 going


on.
 I
 was
 I
 I
 actually
 got
 into
 a
 lot
 of


the
 reason
 why
 Amazon
 laid
 off
 people.


And
 it's
 not
 because
 AI
 is
 replacing


people.
 Like
 that's
 the
 wrong
 narrative.


and
 I
 tried
 to
 verify
 from
 a
 ton
 of


different
 reports
 and
 I'll
 present
 it
 to


you
 guys
 and
 you
 guys
 can
 give
 me
 your


thoughts.
 But
 while
 I
 was
 doing
 that


work,


I
 get
 put
 into
 a
 group
 chat
 on
 Twitter


last
 night
 with
 two
 other
 people
 and
 I'm


looking
 at
 my
 phone
 and
 I'm
 just
 like,


there's
 no
 way
 in
 hell
 I'm
 in
 this
 group


chat.
 I
 get
 put
 into
 this
 group
 chat.
 I


can't
 say
 who
 the
 two
 people
 are.
 Maybe


one
 day
 I
 can
 say
 who
 they
 are.
 But
 I'm


looking
 at
 I'm
 like
 there
 is
 no
 way
 in


hell
 I
 am
 in
 a
 group
 chat
 with
 these
 two


people.
 It
 was
 the
 crazy
 like
 I
 stayed


up
 another
 hour
 just
 thinking
 about


because
 I
 was
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 I'm


in
 this
 group
 chat
 but
 someone
 set
 up
 a


group


and
 uh
 they
 put
 me
 in
 this
 group
 chat


while
 I
 was
 doing
 this
 research
 on


Amazon.
 Then
 I
 was
 like
 this
 [ __ ]
 is


crazy.


Yeah,
 you
 you
 can
 guess.
 I
 cannot
 say
 it


but
 I
 was
 just
 like
 goodness
 gracious


[ __ ]
 is
 crazy.
 Maybe
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 year
 I
 can
 say
 it.
 Maybe
 I
 can
 never


say
 it.
 I
 don't
 know.


Joseph
 Carlson
 and
 Taylor
 Swift.
 Yeah,


that
 would
 be
 awesome.
 It's
 not
 Alex


Carp.
 He
 doesn't
 use
 Twitter.
 But
 it
 was


like
 I'm
 just
 staring
 at
 like
 I
 couldn't


even
 respond
 for
 10
 minutes
 because
 I'm


staring
 at
 I'm
 like
 there's
 no
 way
 like


I'm
 in
 this
 group
 chat.
 But
 I'm
 in
 this


group
 chat


and
 that
 kind
 of
 messed
 up
 my
 research


because
 I
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 well,
 it's


hard
 to
 focus
 now.
 Just
 like
 Pounder
 is


messing
 up
 our
 work
 today.
 It's
 hard
 to


focus.


It
 was
 not
 Tom
 Lee.
 It
 was
 not
 Dan
 Ies.


Cuz
 you
 got
 to
 think
 bigger.
 You
 got
 to


think
 bigger
 than
 that,
 bro.
 You
 got
 to


think
 way
 bigger
 than
 that.
 That's
 why
 I


was
 like,
 "What
 is
 going
 on,
 bro?


What
 is
 going
 on,


but
 yeah,
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 crazy."


It's
 not
 Trump.
 Well,
 Trump
 doesn't
 even


use
 Twitter.
 Trump
 uses
 Trudeo.
 I
 don't


even
 know
 if
 Trump
 would
 I
 don't
 even


know if
 a
 government
 official
 is
 allowed


to
 to
 be
 in
 there.


Uh,
 Nvidia
 right
 there.
 210
 pounder
 now


losing
 197
 back
 down
 to
 196.


But
 it
 do
 did
 lose
 197
 right
 there.
 It


got
 to
 197
 93.
 It's
 not
 Elon.
 It's
 not


Elon.
 I
 would
 I
 would
 say
 if
 it's
 Elon,


it's
 not
 freaking
 Elon,
 but
 it
 still
 was


pretty
 unbelievable.
 Let's
 just
 say


let's
 just
 say
 an
 interview
 or
 a
 podcast


could
 be
 the
 result
 of
 the
 group
 chat
 of


last
 night.
 I
 don't
 know
 when
 it
 would


happen.
 Hopefully,
 it's
 end
 of
 year.
 If


not,
 it
 would
 be
 early
 next
 year.
 But


let's
 just
 say
 someone
 in
 the
 group
 chat


who's
 very
 highly
 influential
 made
 an


intro


with
 me
 and
 another
 person
 who's
 very


highly
 influential.
 And
 I
 think
 the


reason
 for
 that
 based
 on
 the
 further


conversation
 is
 to
 eventually
 get
 to
 a


podcast.


And
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 "This
 is
 crazy,


bro.
 It's
 not
 Jay
 Kush,
 bro.
 It's
 not
 J


I'm
 like
 honestly
 bigger
 than
 Jay
 Kush.


We
 got
 to
 get
 even
 got
 to
 think
 bigger


than
 Jay
 Kush.
 And
 Jay
 Kush
 was
 pretty


big,
 but
 still


I
 I
 will
 let
 you
 guys
 know
 once
 the


interview
 actually
 comes
 out,
 which


hopefully
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 happens


and
 it
 should
 be
 fun.
 Microsoft
 right


there,
 that's
 Microsoft
 losing
 540.
 It


was
 at
 550.
 That
 one
 getting
 hit
 537.


Pinterest
 is
 down.
 Nphase
 is
 also
 down


12.64%.
 All right,
 let's
 talk
 about


layoffs.
 This
 is
 a
 long
 topic.
 We
 got
 a


lot
 to
 talk
 about.
 Let's
 talk
 about


layoffs
 and
 let's
 get into
 it.
 If
 we
 get


198
 on
 Pounder,
 we'll
 go
 back
 to
 it.


Pounder
 right
 there
 197.
 But
 let's
 get


into
 layoffs
 because
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 a
 lot


to
 discuss
 here.


I
 can't
 say
 it,
 guys.
 I
 can't
 say
 I'm


sorry.
 I
 can't
 say
 it.
 I
 really
 can't


say
 it.
 I
 will
 eventually
 say
 it
 when


it's
 time
 to
 say
 it,
 but
 I
 can't
 right


now.
 We
 got
 We
 got
 to
 do
 the
 podcast


first.
 We
 got
 to
 make
 that
 happen.
 But,


uh,


it
 was
 just
 crazy,
 dude.
 Like,
 I
 just
 I


was
 just
 looking
 at
 the
 [ __ ]
 I
 was
 just


like,
 "This
 is
 like
 this
 this
 can't
 be


real,
 bro."
 But
 it's
 like
 I
 looked
 at


their
 accounts
 like
 these
 are
 real


accounts.
 Like


gotta
 respond
 to
 them.
 So
 all right,


layoffs.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 it.
 So
 here's


what
 we
 got
 going
 on.
 What
 happened


yesterday
 and
 what
 caused
 a
 bunch
 of


concern
 in
 the
 labor
 market?
 Amazon
 laid


off
 14,000
 people.
 Legitimately
 last


night
 they
 laid
 off
 14,000
 people
 and


UPS
 is
 getting
 ready
 to
 lay
 off
 48,000


people.
 Now
 this
 is
 a
 set
 with
 a
 variety


of
 other
 companies
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right


here
 on
 the
 screen
 that
 have
 announced


layoffs
 over
 the
 past
 five
 months.
 All


of
 these
 layoffs
 have
 been
 aggressive


and
 all
 of
 those
 layoffs,
 as
 aggressive


as
 they've
 been,
 have
 been
 chocked
 up,


many
 of
 them
 at
 least
 have
 been
 chocked


up
 to
 AI.
 Less
 of
 them
 have
 been
 chocked


up
 to
 demand
 or
 consumers
 not
 having
 as


much
 um,
 you
 know,
 spending
 power
 given


that
 earnings
 have
 been
 really
 good.
 So,


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a
 structural
 problem


in
 the
 broader
 economy,
 but
 I
 do
 think


it's
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 rooted
 in
 AI.
 And


that's
 some
 of
 the
 pain
 that
 we're


seeing
 right
 here.
 Now,
 let
 me
 show
 you


guys
 a
 couple
 things
 before
 we
 get
 into


all
 the
 nitty-gritty
 of
 it.


Um,
 to
 kind
 of
 describe


some
 of
 this
 stuff.
 So,
 if
 you
 go
 on


TikTok
 and
 you
 just
 type
 in
 uh
 Amazon


layoffs,
 you
 are
 going
 to
 see
 massive


massive
 amounts
 of
 people
 that
 are


showing
 that
 they
 got
 laid
 off.
 Here
 is


one
 video
 that
 I
 that
 I
 saw
 yesterday.


>> Was
 laid
 off
 at
 Amazon.
 I
 am
 one
 of
 the


14,000
 employees
 impacted.
 I
 was
 a


senior
 social
 media
 manager
 in
 Amazon


ads
 and
 earlier
 this
 month
 I
 actually


celebrated
 my
 one-year
 anniversary
 or


imversary
 as
 they
 like
 to
 call
 it
 and
 it


was
 the
 closest
 I've
 ever
 come
 to
 a


dream
 role.
 I
 was
 working
 social
 media


marketing
 and
 tech
 something
 I
 would


have
 dreamed
 about
 and
 wished
 for
 in


college.


I
 was
 flown
 out
 to
 work
 my
 first
 can


line
 in
 the
 south
 of
 France
 of
 all


places.
 I
 interviewed
 celebrities
 on
 the


red
 carpet.
 Some
 that
 I
 had
 fang
 girlled


over
 since
 I
 was
 a
 little
 kid.
 But
 most


importantly,
 I
 worked
 at
 a
 globally


recognizable
 company
 that
 I
 knew
 made
 my


immigrant
 parents
 proud.
 And
 even
 my


grandma
 knew
 what
 Amazon
 was
 because
 of


the
 packages
 we
 get
 on
 our
 doorstep.


And
 fast
 forward
 to
 today,
 it
 also


actually
 is
 exactly
 one
 week
 from
 my


birthday.
 I
 guess
 my
 present
 from
 Amazon


just
 uh
 came
 a
 little
 bit
 early.
 But


that's
 all
 to
 say
 I
 am
 feeling
 all
 the


feels.


>> So
 I
 shared
 that
 video
 for
 a
 couple


reasons.
 There's
 a
 few
 things
 to
 talk


about
 right
 there.
 Number
 one,
 this
 is
 a


real
 human
 being,
 right?
 This
 is
 a
 real


person.
 And
 there's
 literally
 thousands


of
 those
 videos
 on
 TikTok
 and
 Instagram


of
 these
 people
 talking
 about
 their


layoffs.
 So,
 you
 know,
 regardless
 of


what
 you
 personally
 may
 feel
 about
 the


individual,
 the
 person,
 or
 the
 job,
 uh


that's
 a
 real
 human
 being
 that
 had
 a


job,
 that
 had
 a
 source
 of
 income,
 and


that
 job
 is
 now
 gone.
 So
 obviously
 this


is
 this
 is
 not
 an
 when
 you
 watch
 a
 lot


of
 these
 videos
 you
 it's
 not
 an
 easy


thing
 to
 digest
 just
 as
 a
 human
 being


because
 you
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 anyone


ever
 lose
 their
 job,
 right?
 And
 so
 it


was
 tough
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 stuff


last
 night,
 but
 it
 was
 a
 decent
 amount


of
 it.
 The
 other
 reason
 I
 showed
 that


video
 is
 because
 notice
 what
 she
 said.


Her
 job
 was
 a
 social
 media
 manager
 for


Amazon
 ads
 where
 she
 goes
 across
 the


world
 and
 interviews
 a
 bunch
 of
 these


celebrities
 to
 be
 able
 to
 like


distribute
 via
 Amazon
 social
 channels.


I
 am
 not
 here
 to
 judge
 if
 that
 is
 a


worthwhile
 job
 or
 not.
 But
 when
 you
 look


at
 the
 people
 that
 Amazon
 is
 laying
 off,


and
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 examples
 of
 the


people
 Amazon
 laid
 off,
 you
 can
 tell


Amazon
 doesn't
 think
 that's
 as
 valuable


anymore.
 Maybe
 a
 year
 ago,
 Amazon


thought
 we
 needed
 a
 social
 media
 manager


for
 ads
 to
 do
 this
 very
 specific
 thing.


Today,
 Amazon's
 like,
 "Hey,
 uh,
 we
 don't


we
 don't
 need
 this."
 And
 it
 could
 be


because
 potentially
 there's
 more
 ways
 to


automate
 this
 in
 regards
 to
 AI.
 uh


potentially
 you
 don't
 need
 the
 type
 of


social
 media
 distribution
 that
 they


thought
 they
 needed
 on
 this
 particular


sector
 of
 the
 business
 or
 and
 this
 is


when
 you
 go
 down
 the
 rabbit
 hole
 you


start
 to
 learn
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 what's


happening
 right
 here
 I
 have
 verified
 the


story
 with
 at least
 10
 different
 sources


I
 don't
 know if
 it's
 the
 actual
 truth


and
 maybe
 Jasse
 is
 going to
 give
 us
 some


more
 updates
 on
 Thursday
 but
 the
 reason


Amazon
 is
 cutting
 30,000
 people
 is
 not


because
 business
 is
 bad
 or
 because


they're
 replacing
 them
 with
 AI
 it's


because
 they
 need
 the
 money
 for
 GPUs


AWS
 has
 a
 $195
 billion
 backlog
 that's


growing
 25%
 year-over-year,
 but
 they


can't
 buy
 Compute
 fast
 enough
 to
 meet


demand.
 This
 is
 why
 their
 uh
 earnings


growth
 for
 AWS
 last
 for
 the
 past
 two


quarters
 has
 been
 lagging
 partly
 because


of
 structural
 issues,
 but
 also
 partly


because
 they
 don't
 have
 the
 ability
 to


buy
 as
 many
 GPUs
 to
 be
 able
 to
 meet
 all


the
 demand
 that
 they
 have.
 This
 is


capital
 choosing
 GPUs
 over
 people
 and


every
 hyperscaler
 is
 doing
 it.
 Meta
 has


cut
 5%
 over
 the
 past
 six
 months
 and
 they


recently
 just
 cut
 600
 new
 people
 in
 the


AI
 division
 as
 well.
 This
 is
 a
 good


video
 I
 want
 to
 play
 as
 well.
 This
 guy
 I


think
 broke
 it
 down
 uh
 in
 in
 the
 best


way
 that
 I've
 seen,
 but
 it's
 definitely


something
 that
 can't
 be
 ignored
 and
 I
 do


think
 it
 adds
 a
 lot
 more
 layers
 to


what's
 going
 on
 with
 Amazon
 and
 what
 we


could
 see
 from
 a
 lot
 of
 other


hyperscalers
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 layoffs.


>> Amazon
 laid
 off
 30,000
 people
 today.
 The


narrative
 is
 that
 this
 is
 about
 AI


replacing
 jobs.
 The
 reality
 is
 very


different
 and
 I
 want
 to
 be
 really


precise
 about
 it
 because
 it
 gets
 at


corporate
 structure
 and
 finance
 and
 not


really
 at
 AI
 and
 the
 way
 you
 think.
 So


when
 people
 think
 AI
 layoffs,
 they
 think


the
 robots
 are
 doing
 the
 jobs
 now
 and


therefore
 we
 are
 having
 layoffs.
 No,
 the


people
 who
 are
 doing
 the
 jobs
 are
 more


stressed
 if
 they're
 still
 at
 Amazon.
 But


the
 AI
 automation
 story
 isn't
 actually


hitting
 those
 jobs.
 What
 is
 hitting


those
 jobs
 and
 is
 related
 to
 AI
 is
 the


cost
 of
 chips.
 So
 Nvidia
 sells
 chips
 to


everyone.
 GPUs,
 those
 chips
 are
 how
 we


power
 AI.
 And
 none
 of
 the
 major
 cloud


providers
 can
 get
 enough
 chips
 right


now.
 Microsoft
 can't.
 Google
 can't.


Google's
 in
 an
 easier
 spot.
 They
 have


TPUs.
 And
 Amazon
 definitely
 can't.
 In


fact,
 people
 don't
 know
 this,
 but
 AWS


has
 a
 roughly
 25%
 burning
 backlog
 on


GPUs.
 In
 other
 words,
 they
 are
 missing


out
 on
 revenue
 because
 companies
 are


begging
 for
 more
 compute
 from
 AWS
 that


they
 can't
 fulfill
 because
 they
 can't


buy
 GPUs
 because
 they
 only
 had
 so
 much


budgeted
 to
 buy
 GPUs.
 And
 so,
 yes,
 the


layoffs
 are
 related
 to
 AI.
 But
 in
 this


case,
 it
 is
 burning
 corporate
 demand
 for


GPU
 chips
 that
 is
 hitting
 the
 capital


expenditure
 budget
 of
 Amazon
 so
 hard


that
 they
 need
 to
 find
 other
 ways
 to


reduce
 fixed
 costs
 so
 they
 can
 meet
 the


expectations
 of
 Wall
 Street
 around
 the


overall
 margins
 of
 the
 business.
 And
 you


might
 be
 like,
 well,
 why
 does
 that


matter?
 They're
 all
 like
 billion-dollar


companies.
 In
 Amazon's
 case,
 their


margins
 have
 always
 been
 notoriously


thin
 everywhere
 except
 AWS.
 Retail
 is


like
 a
 ridiculously
 thin
 business,
 but


the
 AWS
 margins
 have
 been
 really
 good.


And
 so,
 The
 Street,
 for
 better
 or
 worse,


expects
 them
 to
 continue
 growing
 the


high
 margin
 business
 at
 a
 good
 clip.
 The


street
 was
 not
 happy
 with
 their
 18%


year-over-year
 growth
 rate
 this
 quarter.


And
 the
 street
 is
 looking
 for
 them
 to


pick
 that
 growth
 rate
 back
 up,
 which


they
 cannot
 do
 if
 they
 cannot
 buy
 more


chips.
 And
 they
 cannot
 buy
 more
 chips


without
 destroying
 their
 margin
 unless


they
 can
 cut
 costs
 other
 places.
 And


chips
 are
 so
 expensive
 that
 the
 only
 way


they
 can
 cut
 costs
 is
 by
 going
 after


jobs
 or
 fixed
 costs
 or
 salaries.
 And


that
 is
 what
 is
 happening.
 And
 so
 really


when
 you
 read
 this,
 instead
 of
 reading


this
 as
 a
 guide
 book
 to
 where
 AI
 is


automating,
 read
 it
 as
 a
 guidebook
 to


the
 things
 that
 Amazon
 finds
 least


painful
 to
 cut
 when
 they
 have
 to
 trade


talent
 for
 GPU.


>> And
 think
 about
 that.
 Does
 Amazon
 care


more
 about
 a
 social
 media
 manager
 for


ads
 or
 do
 they
 care
 about
 GPUs?
 And


that's
 why
 I
 shared
 the
 first
 video.


It's
 like
 obviously
 like
 10
 times
 out
 of


10
 they're
 going
 to
 pick
 the
 GPUs.
 They


they
 do
 not
 need
 a
 social
 media
 manager


for
 ads.
 They'll
 figure
 that
 part
 out


later.
 The
 GPUs
 is
 what
 matters
 more.


That's
 real
 revenue.
 That's
 high
 margin


for
 AWS.
 So
 again,
 this
 theory,
 it's
 not


fully
 confirmed.
 I
 expect
 Jasse
 to
 talk


about
 it,
 but
 it
 feels
 a
 lot
 more


validated
 based
 on
 what
 I've
 been
 seeing


versus
 just
 demand
 is
 bad.
 That's
 why


they're
 cutting
 jobs.


>> EU
 in
 order
 to
 maintain
 their
 margins.


So
 these
 were
 very
 hard
 discussions
 and


the
 places
 they
 cut
 are
 places
 that
 I


think
 they
 are
 strategically
 not
 as


invested
 in
 and
 that
 is
 the
 way
 I
 read


it.
 None
 of
 this
 does
 anything
 to
 make


people
 who
 got
 fired
 today
 feel
 better.


Uh
 and
 so
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 pretend
 it


does.
 Uh
 if
 you
 got
 let
 go
 from
 Amazon


that
 really
 sucks
 and
 this
 doesn't
 fix


it.
 And
 you
 know,
 for
 those
 that


actually
 watched
 the
 videos
 last
 night


or
 if
 you
 watch
 any
 videos
 today
 about


uh
 you
 know,
 people
 getting
 laid
 off,


it's
 sad.
 It
 is
 very,
 very
 sad
 to
 see.


It's
 just


it
 feels
 like
 Amazon
 is
 really
 making
 a


decision
 right
 here
 about
 GPUs
 over


jobs.
 There's
 a
 couple
 of
 other
 sources


I
 was
 looking
 at
 last
 night.
 Here's


another
 one
 saying
 that
 it
 feels
 like


this
 is
 more
 about
 capex
 to
 buy
 GPUs,


not
 employees.
 And
 then
 when
 you
 look
 at


the
 types
 of
 jobs
 that
 were
 fired,
 I


mean
 from
 the
 other
 videos
 that
 were


watching,
 there
 were
 some
 software


engineers
 that
 got
 fired,
 which
 you


know,
 software
 engineers
 matter
 um


probably
 more
 than
 a
 social
 media


manager
 for
 ads
 in
 terms
 of the
 value


they
 provide
 to
 the
 business.
 But
 a
 lot


of
 the
 software
 engineers
 are
 also


starting
 to
 become
 commoditized
 by
 AI.


And
 one
 engineer
 can
 do
 the
 work
 of
 10.


So
 you
 might
 not
 need
 10
 of
 them.
 But


then
 number
 two,
 if
 you're
 firing
 these


social
 media
 managers
 and
 you're
 and


you're
 relying
 more
 on
 GPUs,
 that
 should


increase
 AWS
 growth.
 AWS
 has
 36%


operating
 margins.
 The
 retail
 business


has
 like
 5%.
 or
 it's
 like
 5.3%.


So,
 it
 seems
 very
 obvious
 what
 Amazon's


doing.
 And
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 the
 stock


broke
 233
 as
 well
 today,
 right
 now
 at


229
 because
 the
 street
 likes
 that


they're
 making
 this
 decision


and
 the
 street
 wants
 them
 to
 get
 rid
 of


these
 jobs.
 I'll
 put
 the
 link
 to
 that


video
 in
 the
 chat
 for
 anyone
 who
 wants


to
 watch
 it
 um
 over
 GPUs.
 So,
 now
 here's


my
 question
 to
 everybody
 and
 I
 see


Austin
 in
 the
 chat
 kind
 of
 put
 a


statement
 that
 I
 was
 thinking
 about
 as


well.


If
 this
 is
 a
 trend


with
 the
 broader
 uh
 tech
 companies
 that


are
 out
 there
 getting
 rid
 of
 these,
 call


it
 $150,000
 to
 $200,000
 a
 year
 paying


jobs
 because
 if
 you
 look
 at
 some
 of
 the


salaries,
 these
 social
 media
 managers,


dude,
 they're
 making
 six
 figures.
 It's


not
 like
 this
 is
 a
 $30,000
 job.
 Like


they're
 making
 they're
 getting
 stock
 as


well,
 right?
 These
 are
 very
 cushiony


white
 collar
 jobs,
 you
 know,
 day
 in
 the


life.
 You
 get
 to
 go
 get
 some
 um
 what
 is


it?
 Kimcha
 or
 whatever
 the
 people
 drink


in
 the
 in
 the
 office,
 right?
 like
 these


are
 the
 types
 of
 jobs
 that
 Amazon
 is


getting
 rid
 of.
 Do
 you
 think
 if
 a
 lot
 of


these
 companies
 get
 rid
 of
 these
 jobs


either
 because
 AI
 is
 being


AI
 is
 functioning
 as
 a
 form
 of


replacement
 or
 uh
 they
 need
 money
 to
 buy


GPUs.
 What
 does
 that
 do
 for
 the
 fabric


of
 society?


What
 does
 that
 do
 for
 the
 fabric
 of


because
 these
 are
 15,000
 real
 people


that
 got
 laid
 off
 yesterday
 and
 they


need
 to
 go
 find
 a
 job.
 And
 by
 the
 way,


based
 on
 all
 the
 charts
 that
 we've
 been


looking
 at,
 we
 are
 in
 a
 lowfire,
 low


hire
 job.
 We
 might
 start
 getting
 into
 a


high
 fire
 low
 hireer
 job
 market.
 But
 we


are
 not
 seeing
 as
 many
 job
 openings
 as


we
 saw
 years
 ago


and
 that
 is
 you
 know
 likely
 because
 of


this
 issue
 that
 companies
 are
 wondering


do
 they
 need
 to
 actually
 hire.


Dude,
 that's
 how
 you
 say
 it
 right.
 It's


kombucha.
 How
 do
 you
 say
 this
 stupid


drink?
 Bro,
 I
 had
 it
 once.
 I
 was
 like


why
 would
 anyone
 drink
 this
 dude?


Kombucha.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 it's
 in
 every


tech
 company.


It's
 kombucha,
 right?


>> Kombucha,


>> dude,
 I
 said
 it
 right.
 What
 are
 you
 guys


talking
 about?
 It's
 kombucha.


When
 I
 went
 to
 the
 Uber
 headquarters


back
 in
 uh
 back
 in
 in in
 February
 when
 I


was
 at
 the
 Robinet
 event
 and
 uh
 we
 met


someone
 there,
 like
 we
 opened
 their


fridge,
 it
 was
 all
 kombucha.
 I
 was
 like,


"Bro,
 like
 no,
 I'm
 not
 drinking
 this


shit."
 Like,
 "What
 is
 this,
 dude?"
 Like,


every
 tech
 company,
 they
 all
 these


kombuchas.
 But
 the
 point
 it it
 just
 it


it
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 this
 is
 going
 to


end
 nicely
 is
 my
 point.
 And
 and


obviously
 no
 one
 knows
 how
 this
 plays


out.
 But
 there's
 a
 reason
 Pounder
 said


we
 want
 to
 not
 hire
 as
 I
 remember
 on
 on


the
 earnings
 call
 uh
 last
 quarter.


Alsarp
 said
 we
 want
 to
 10x
 the
 revenue


with
 with
 keeping
 the
 same
 headcount.


They
 only
 have
 4,000
 employees.


Pounder's
 always
 been
 a
 company
 that's


been
 light
 on
 headcount.
 But
 pounders
 is


growing
 like
 crazy
 and
 they're
 not


hiring
 like
 crazy
 because
 they
 want
 to


have
 the
 most
 effective
 engineers
 and


they
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 these
 types
 of


roles
 that
 hurt
 the
 bottom
 line.


And
 for
 Amazon,
 it
 looks
 like
 it
 seems


like
 this
 could
 hurt
 the
 bottom
 line.


Palant
 right
 here
 still
 trying
 to
 get
 to


198
 197
 93.


But
 I
 just
 thought
 this
 story
 has
 been


fascinating
 and
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


nuance
 to
 where
 the
 story
 is
 going
 to


play
 out.
 Let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat
 if


anyone's
 been
 affected
 by
 the
 layoffs,


if
 you
 have
 friends
 that
 are
 affected.


We
 had
 a
 couple
 people
 yesterday
 from


Amazon
 that
 were
 in
 the
 chat
 and
 uh
 they


were
 a
 bit
 affected.
 I
 mean,
 again,


you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 these
 CarMax


cuts
 about
 350
 service
 jobs
 after
 a
 week


earnings.


I
 don't
 want
 to
 say
 the
 labor
 market's


completely
 deteriorating
 because
 I
 don't


think
 we
 have
 enough
 data
 yet,
 but
 I
 I


do
 want
 to
 say
 that
 you're
 starting
 to


see
 tech
 companies
 say
 we
 might
 not
 need


the
 jobs
 that
 we
 thought
 we
 needed
 a


year
 ago


because
 of
 AI
 in
 some
 way.
 Now,
 the
 rate


cut
 situation
 becomes
 even
 more
 juicy


because
 what
 is
 the
 Fed
 going
 to
 do
 if


you're
 seeing
 all
 these
 layoffs?
 You're


going to
 cut
 the
 damn
 rates.


And
 it
 seems
 inevitable
 that
 we're
 going


to
 get
 to
 that
 2
 and a
 half%
 that
 Trump


thinks
 we're
 going to
 get
 to
 by
 the
 end


of
 next
 year.
 And
 if
 the
 labor
 market


continues
 to
 worsen,
 then


you
 know
 that
 might
 continue
 as
 well.


Um


Rile
 says,
 "Coup
 of
 my
 friends
 got


affected,
 both
 software
 engineers."


Um
 I
 know
 someone
 from
 UPS
 got
 affected.


She
 was
 in
 the
 marketing
 department.


Overall
 bearish
 or
 bullish?
 I
 think


overall,
 you
 know,
 at
 the
 end
 of the


day,
 it's
 bullish
 for
 margins.
 Like
 this


is
 bullish
 for
 Amazon
 increasing
 their


margins.
 One
 could
 argue
 it's
 bearish


for
 the
 broader
 economy
 and
 broader


society.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 answer
 when
 you


see
 these
 types
 of
 layoffs
 is
 you
 got
 to


own
 the
 assets
 of
 the
 company
 because


the
 shareholders
 are
 the
 ones
 that
 are


being
 rewarded
 here.
 It's
 just
 that


simple.
 It
 is
 just
 that
 simple
 that


Amazon
 is
 picking
 shareholders
 over


employees


and
 they're
 doing
 it
 in
 a
 way
 that


prioritizes
 AWS
 growth
 which
 means
 they


need
 more
 GPUs


and
 they
 and
 they
 probably
 you
 know


again
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 much
 that


social
 media
 manager
 for
 ads
 was
 making


but
 she
 lived
 in
 New
 York.
 She
 probably


wasn't
 making
 40
 50
 grand.
 Like
 to
 live


in
 New
 York
 you've
 got
 to
 be
 making
 some


substantial
 amounts
 of
 money.
 Like
 you


would
 imagine
 at
 least
 150
 to
 200
 with


stock.
 probably
 not
 as
 much
 as
 a


software
 engineer,
 but
 even
 if
 it
 was


like,
 you
 know,
 75
 to
 125,
 th
 those
 are


those
 are
 decent
 paying
 jobs.
 And
 now


she
 has
 to
 try
 to
 find
 another
 one.
 And


the
 question
 becomes,
 what
 does
 that


mean
 for
 the
 broader
 economy?
 If
 you


know
 people
 like
 that
 I
 mean
 you
 one


could
 argue
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 economy
 has


been
 propped
 up
 over
 the
 past
 decade


from
 project
 managers
 and
 consultants


and
 these
 white
 collar
 jobs
 in
 Silicon


Valley
 that
 have
 been
 able
 to
 be
 paid


vast
 amounts
 of
 money
 because
 these


companies
 have
 such
 amazing
 margins
 that


they're
 able
 to
 hoard
 all
 this
 talent.


If
 you
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this
 chart
 from


the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 the
 top
 10%
 of


earners
 now
 account
 for
 half
 of
 all
 the


spending.
 We've
 heard
 this
 stat
 before


but
 this
 is
 from
 Moody's
 Analytics
 to


give
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 context.


This
 is
 the
 bifrocation
 of
 the
 economy


that
 we
 have
 right
 now.


It
 is
 a
 complete
 bifurcation.
 Felix,


thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Bear
 theory.


Do
 you
 think
 AI
 plus
 robotics
 will
 equal


layoffs
 will
 trigger
 socialist
 movements


that
 will
 vote
 against
 AI
 robotics?
 Uh,


yes.
 I
 think
 that's
 very
 possible
 and
 I


think
 that's
 what
 Austin
 said
 in
 the


chat.
 You
 are
 giving
 the
 socialists
 fuel


when
 Amazon
 does
 something
 like
 this.


Now,
 practically,
 does
 it
 make
 sense
 for


Amazon
 to
 do
 this?
 Yes.
 I
 mean,
 you


probably
 don't
 need
 the
 social
 media


manager.
 probably
 need
 the
 GPU
 because


you
 need
 AWS
 growth
 and
 that's
 what


matters
 in
 this
 very
 competitive
 AI


race.
 But
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 people
 that
 are


from
 the
 ideology
 that
 is
 more
 anti-


capitalism,
 they
 don't
 give
 a
 [ __ ]
 about


GPUs
 or
 margins
 or
 EPS.
 They're
 thinking


of
 the
 headline
 and
 the
 headline
 is


Amazon
 picks
 shareholders
 over
 employees


and
 then
 they're
 going
 to
 see
 Amazon
 has


record
 profits
 this
 year,
 not
 knowing


that
 the
 stock's
 been
 a
 turn.
 So
 it's


like
 all
 of
 us
 are
 like,
 "Okay,
 cool.


Yes,
 lots
 of
 revenue,
 lots
 of
 profits,


but
 the
 stock's
 not
 moving
 because
 we're


on
 this
 side
 of
 the
 camp.
 And
 he
 got
 the


people
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 the
 camp


saying,
 "How
 can
 you
 not
 recognize
 that


Jeff
 Bezos
 is
 the
 most
 greedy
 person
 in


the
 world?
 His
 net
 worth
 has
 gone
 up
 by


blah
 blah
 blah."
 Like,
 yeah,
 but
 like


the
 stock
 is
 kind
 of
 flat.
 Like,
 the
 EPS


is
 not
 the
 best.
 So,
 it's
 just
 two


different
 dichotoies
 of
 of
 schools
 of


thought.
 And
 when
 you
 have
 a
 headline


that
 says
 we're
 going
 to
 fire
 15,000


people
 because
 of
 AI
 or
 because
 of


shareholders,
 like
 that's
 that's
 that's


giving
 a
 lot
 more
 people
 who
 don't
 own


assets,
 which
 is
 99%
 of
 America,
 they're


going
 to
 feel,
 you
 know,
 or
 I
 should
 not


say
 99%
 of
 America,
 but
 I
 should
 say,


you
 know,
 the
 the
 vast
 majority
 of


Americans
 that
 maybe
 have
 some


allocation
 to
 assets,
 but
 don't


actually,
 you
 know,
 actively
 track
 or


care
 about
 their
 assets
 outside
 of
 their


401k,
 those
 people
 and
 if
 they're
 living


paycheck
 to
 paycheck,
 haven't
 gotten
 a


wage
 increase
 in
 a
 while,
 Those
 people


are
 going
 to
 get
 pissed
 off.
 It's


inevitable.
 It's
 human
 nature.
 They're


going to
 get
 pissed
 off.


And
 then
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 how


that
 plays
 out.


Mitch,
 should
 we
 support
 socialism?
 I


I'm
 definitely
 not
 a
 socialist.
 I
 will


say
 that.
 But
 like
 I
 and
 look,
 Mumani,


he's
 I
 mean
 there's
 a
 good
 shot
 he
 wins.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 referendum
 on
 a
 lot


of
 the
 state
 of
 what
 people
 are
 feeling


in
 terms
 of
 wealth
 inequality.
 If
 you're


an
 asset
 holder,
 that's
 something
 you


can't
 ignore.


You
 definitely
 can't
 ignore
 that


alphabet
 right
 there.
 269
 as
 well.
 Sarah


says,
 "So,
 are
 we
 buying
 Amazon?"


I
 mean,
 yeah,
 dude.
 Look,
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day,
 I
 think
 it's
 still
 a
 buy.
 Like,


if
 they're
 cutting
 these
 many
 people
 to


increase
 their
 margins
 and
 buy
 more


GPUs,
 like
 obviously
 Jassis
 be
 getting


pretty
 cutthroat
 here.
 And
 I
 I
 can
 be


sympathetic
 for
 the
 people
 that
 have


lost
 their
 job,
 but
 I
 can
 also
 be


rational
 as
 a
 shareholder
 and
 say,
 "Hey,


this
 will
 likely
 help
 the
 stock


perform."


So,
 I
 do
 think
 Amazon's
 buy.
 Now,
 the


the
 thing
 is
 if
 they
 don't
 have
 AWS


growth
 in
 Q4
 and
 the
 layoffs
 are
 not


really
 affecting
 AWS
 guidance
 until
 like


Q2,
 Q3,
 2026,
 you
 might
 have
 the
 stock


drop
 because
 they're
 just
 not
 able
 to


put
 up
 the
 right
 numbers.
 That
 could


also
 be
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 red
 flag
 before


earnings
 that
 they're
 doing
 these


layoffs
 like
 to
 kind
 of
 cushion
 the
 lack


of
 AWS
 growth.
 So,
 they
 need
 like
 some


news
 to
 tell
 shareholders
 they're
 going


to
 figure
 it
 out.


Um,
 but
 regardless,
 I
 still
 think
 it's


the
 right
 company
 to
 to
 own
 long
 term.


Capitalism
 is
 brutal.
 That
 is
 correct.


Capitalism
 is
 indeed
 brutal.
 Pow
 will
 be


on
 at
 230.
 Pow
 beyond
 is
 230.


Hans
 says,
 I'm
 I'm
 in
 Seattle
 and
 I
 hear


a
 ton
 of
 opinions
 all
 the
 time
 about
 tax


Amazon.
 Yeah,
 a
 lot
 of people
 they


Amazon
 actually
 sent
 the
 email
 at
 5:00


am
 Seattle
 time.
 They
 literally
 sent
 it


in
 order
 for
 people
 to
 not
 show
 up
 to


the
 office


to
 not
 show
 up
 to
 the
 office.


Um,


Seabor
 says
 I
 think
 the
 question
 should


be
 Amazon
 along
 with
 all
 the
 other


hyperscalers
 have
 accumulated
 nearly
 1


trillion
 of
 compute
 backlog.
 If
 they


don't
 deliver,
 customers
 go.
 Yeah,


that's
 another
 good
 point.
 And
 if
 they


need
 to
 deliver
 and
 they
 need
 to
 get
 the


money
 from
 somewhere
 to
 deliver
 to
 buy


the
 GPUs
 necessary
 to
 continue
 providing


AI
 workloads,
 the
 money's
 got
 to
 come


from
 somewhere.
 And
 really,
 you
 know,


where
 else
 do
 you
 get
 the
 money
 from?


It's
 either
 layoffs
 or
 you
 become
 more


efficient.
 Amazon's
 a
 very
 big
 company.


I
 mean,
 yes,
 they
 can
 become
 more


efficient,
 quote
 unquote,
 over
 time,
 but


that's
 not
 going
 to
 create
 billions
 of


dollars
 today
 that
 they
 need
 potentially


to
 be
 able
 to
 uh
 acquire
 these
 GPUs.


So
 it
 is
 a
 it
 is
 a
 big
 point.
 Uh
 the


Caterpillar
 CEO
 on
 data
 center
 power


demand.
 He
 says
 we're
 at
 the
 early


stages
 of
 the
 prime
 power
 opportunity.


So
 we're
 excited
 to
 have
 more
 of
 those


come
 online.
 We're
 continuing
 to
 raise


the
 capacity.
 Lead
 times
 are
 starting
 to


get
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 extended.
 The


larger
 turbo
 turbines
 for
 solar
 need


longer
 lead
 times.


All
 right.
 You've
 got
 Caterpillar
 CEO


making
 the
 argument
 for
 data
 center
 and


power
 continuing
 to
 be
 a
 tailwind
 for


them.
 Wow.
 12.
 Is
 that
 alltime
 highs?


That
 is
 oldtime
 eyes
 on
 Caterpillar.


Incredible.


I
 mean,
 this
 is
 a
 name
 that
 not
 a
 ton
 of


people
 were
 talking
 about,
 but
 year
 to


date,
 64%.
 I
 mean,
 that
 that's
 the


beauty
 of
 a
 real
 bull
 market.
 You
 start


to
 get
 some
 of
 these
 gems
 that
 make
 big


moves


because
 of
 the
 overall
 capex
 trend
 that


doesn't
 seem
 to
 be
 slowing
 down.


George,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 I'm


starting
 to
 get
 FOMO.
 If
 you
 do
 get


FOMO,
 it's
 one
 of
 those
 things
 that
 you


have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 internally
 deal
 with.


Um,
 look,
 I
 I
 I've
 had
 FOMO
 all
 year


about
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 names,
 but
 I


I've
 not
 capitulated.
 I've
 not
 bought


Open
 Door.
 I'm
 not
 buying
 ASST,
 which
 is


like
 the
 new
 FINT
 favorite
 name,
 down
 9%


on
 the
 day
 that
 people
 are
 buying
 for


some
 reason.
 Like
 they
 like
 when
 you


when
 you
 have
 FOMO,
 you
 have
 to
 really


ask
 yourself,
 again,
 we
 talked
 about


this
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago,
 do
 you
 feel
 the


risk
 to
 reward
 on
 whatever
 name
 you're


feeling
 FOMO
 on
 is
 worth
 it?


And
 usually
 the
 riskreward
 is
 not
 worth


it
 when
 you're
 feeling
 FOMO
 because
 that


means
 the
 move
 has
 already
 been
 made.


Now,
 if
 you're
 buying
 a
 good
 quality


company
 like
 Nvidia,
 even
 if
 you're


buying
 it
 at
 208,
 if
 it
 goes
 back
 to
 200


over
 the
 long
 term,
 you
 should
 be
 okay.


But
 if
 you're
 buying
 it
 for
 the
 pure


fact
 that
 you
 think
 it's
 going to
 go
 to


215,
 you're
 going to
 be
 pissed
 off
 if
 it


doesn't
 go
 there.
 Which
 is
 usually
 why


FOMO,
 the
 easy
 option
 is
 to
 always
 just


never
 chase
 unless
 you're
 totally
 ready


to
 lose
 the
 money.
 Because
 if
 you're
 not


buying
 of
 the
 long-term
 mentality
 that


like
 if
 if
 it
 doesn't
 make
 the
 move
 and


you're
 buying
 it
 at
 the
 the
 height
 of


its
 move,
 then
 at
 that
 point
 you
 just


backhold
 it,


which
 is
 not
 the
 best.
 Four
 is
 down
 7%


because
 Ferve,
 it's
 in
 the
 same
 sector.


Ferve
 took
 a
 40%
 hit.
 Ship
 four


payments,
 PayPal,
 all
 those
 payment


companies
 got
 hit.
 Ferve
 is
 now
 down


41%.
 Little
 recovery.
 It
 was
 down
 45,


but
 still
 41.


You
 bought
 Weeble.
 I
 did
 buy
 Weebo.
 That


was
 pure
 FOMO.
 That
 That
 That's
 true.


That's
 right.
 I
 did
 have
 my
 moment
 of


FOMO.
 We
 broke
 even
 on
 it,
 but
 dude,
 I


bought
 it
 at
 12
 and
 it's
 at
 11.
 I
 ended


up
 selling
 at
 like
 1250
 and
 I
 wrote
 a


covered
 call
 to
 like
 make
 up
 what
 I


lost,
 but
 uh
 the
 fact
 that
 it's
 at
 11


and
 I
 bought
 it
 at
 12
 back
 in
 July
 is


crazy.


People
 really
 think
 this
 thing
 is
 going


to
 20
 by
 the
 end
 of the
 year.
 I
 don't


know.
 I
 mean,
 all
 the
 volatility
 is
 good


in
 the
 market
 for
 Weeble,
 but
 I
 don't


know
 if
 they're
 capitalizing
 on
 it
 in


the
 best
 way.
 You
 should
 fomo
 and


kombucha.
 Dude,
 has
 anyone
 drink
 that


[ __ ]
 It
 is
 disgusting,
 bro.
 I
 had
 it


once.
 I
 think
 my
 sister
 brought
 it
 home


a
 couple
 years
 ago.
 She's
 like, "You


should
 try
 this."


Like
 passion
 fruit
 tangerine
 kombucha.
 I


thought
 it
 would
 taste
 like
 juice.
 It


tastes
 like
 hell.
 That's
 what
 it
 tastes


like.
 It
 tasted
 like
 literal
 hell.
 I'm


like,
 I
 never
 want
 to
 taste
 this
 again


ever.


I
 I
 don't
 know
 why.
 I
 don't
 know
 why


anyone
 drinks
 this.


Oh,
 we
 got
 more
 layoff
 news.
 Oh
 boy.
 We


got
 more
 layoff
 news.


I
 don't
 think
 this
 story
 is
 slowing


down,
 folks.
 This
 could
 be
 I
 mean,
 this


is
 something
 we
 got
 to
 watch
 out
 for.


This
 could
 be
 something
 that
 we
 have
 to


watch
 out.
 Wow.
 General
 Motors
 1,200


workers
 at
 its
 EV
 factory
 in
 Detroit.


Hundreds
 more
 losing
 jobs
 at
 battery


plants
 in
 Tennessee
 and
 Ohio.


You
 know
 who
 that's
 bearish
 for?
 That


feels
 like
 that's
 more
 bearish
 for
 EVs


than
 anything,
 the
 EV
 industry.
 Now,


granted,
 GM
 is
 not
 the
 best
 at
 making


EVs,
 so
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 has
 to
 be


bearish
 Tesla
 or
 anything,
 but
 these


legacy
 companies
 that
 have
 had
 their


stocks
 do.
 And
 see,
 here's
 the
 thing.


This
 is
 what
 this
 is
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 the


socialists
 are
 going
 to
 look
 like.
 GM


stock
 is
 up
 36%
 year-to
 date,
 and


they're
 firing
 employees.


Like,
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 look
 at
 the


nuance.
 They're
 going
 to
 say
 this
 is


what
 greedy
 capitalist
 shareholders
 do


and


as
 a
 result
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 create
 the


best
 narrative.


The
 government
 tax
 break
 for
 EVs
 is
 gone


which
 is
 also
 true
 and
 that's
 probably
 a


reason
 why
 this
 is
 happening.


Dude,
 we
 still
 have
 this
 government


shutdown
 too.
 Like
 that's
 also
 I
 mean


there's
 you
 talk
 about
 people
 not


getting
 paid.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 people


not
 getting
 paid
 right
 now
 because
 of


that
 shutdown.
 the
 10.
 You're
 just
 below


four


on
 the
 day
 as
 well.


Can
 we
 do
 a
 kombucha
 poll?
 This
 is


important.


Dude,
 I
 feel
 like
 a
 lot
 of you
 guys
 are


tech
 workers.
 That's
 why
 that's
 why


you're
 freaking


asking
 about
 kombucha.


All
 right,
 let's
 uh
 let's
 let's
 watch


this.
 I'll
 make
 that
 poll,
 but
 this
 is


uh
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 coverage
 on
 these


layoffs
 that
 we've
 been
 seeing.


>> Andrew,
 Amazon,
 Cheg,
 Microsoft,
 Meta,


Salesforce,
 the
 list
 continues.
 Tech


companies
 just
 are
 cutting
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 jobs
 and
 some
 of
 them
 some


of
 them
 are
 blaming
 AI.
 But
 at
 Nvidia's


GTC
 in
 DC
 yesterday,
 top
 CEOs
 were


telling
 us
 something
 completely


different
 about
 what's
 driving
 these


cuts.
 For
 example,
 Perplexity
 CEO
 uh


says
 the
 AI
 narrative
 is
 missing
 the


point.


>> Overhiring
 they
 did
 in
 the
 co
 era
 when


they
 didn't
 actually
 need
 to.
 That's


that
 the
 results
 of
 that
 are
 being
 seen


now.
 So
 correlation
 doesn't
 imply


costition
 like
 it's
 not
 because
 of
 AI


that
 people
 are
 losing
 jobs


>> and
 Cororeweave
 CEO
 Michael
 Intractor


frames
 it
 as
 part
 of
 a
 bigger
 pattern


that
 just
 happens
 in
 tech
 history


>> during
 each
 uh
 technical
 revolution.


there
 is
 a
 rotation
 that
 occurs
 and
 uh
 I


think
 one
 of
 the
 roles
 for
 government
 is


going
 to
 be
 to
 assist
 uh
 the
 the
 the
 uh


rotation
 that's
 required
 to
 retrain
 to


repurpose
 uh
 uh
 to
 allow
 people
 to
 build


careers


>> and
 Crouch
 CEO
 George
 Kirk
 told
 me
 AI


elevates
 workers
 into
 controllers
 while


AI
 will
 handle
 all
 of
 the
 grunt
 work.
 So


essentially
 working
 alongside
 AI
 that's


what
 humans
 will
 do.
 The
 reality
 though


is
 just
 more
 complicated.
 Amazon
 we
 know


cut
 14,000
 jobs
 citing
 AI.
 Microsoft


eliminated
 over
 15,000
 this
 year
 while


investing
 about
 80
 billion
 in
 AI.
 Meta


slashed
 600
 from
 its
 AI
 unit.
 Salesforce


cut
 4,000.
 You
 get
 the
 point.
 All
 while


record
 posting
 almost
 record
 profits.


The
 CEOs
 at
 GTC
 aren't
 just
 buying
 the


AI
 replacement
 story
 their
 own
 industry


is
 pushing.
 They
 say
 companies
 are
 using


AI
 as
 cover
 to
 finally
 correct
 years
 of


bloated
 headcount
 and
 hiring
 mistakes.


guys.


>> Okay.
 So,
 well,
 here's
 the
 thing.
 I


think
 about
 Nvidia
 to5
 trillion
 dollars.


That's
 that's
 a
 question
 about
 where


we're
 all
 going.
 But
 the
 other
 piece
 of


it
 on
 the
 employment
 side
 is
 for
 all
 of


these
 companies
 and
 Nvidia
 and
 the
 like


to
 get
 to
 these
 valuations,
 they
 have
 to


create
 remarkable
 amounts
 of


productivity.
 So,
 if
 they're
 as


successful
 as
 we
 all
 want
 them
 to
 be,


it
 also
 means
 that
 maybe
 there's
 going


to
 be
 folks
 who
 don't
 have
 jobs
 to


ultimately
 pay
 for
 all
 of
 this.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 to
 your
 point,
 they're
 going


to
 have


>> roundtrip
 idea.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 cut
 jobs.
 You
 mean
 in
 order


to
 lower
 cost
 so
 that
 they
 remain
 more


productive
 and
 keep
 the
 margins?
 Is
 that


what
 you're
 implying?
 Ex.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 of
 course,
 but
 then
 for
 Nvidia's


case,
 they
 have
 the
 money,
 right?


They're
 spending
 like
 crazy.
 They're


investing
 in
 Intel.
 uh
 they're


announcing
 $1
 billion
 dollars
 in
 Nokia.


So
 I
 guess
 if
 you're
 an
 employee
 at


Nvidia,
 which
 and
 there's
 no
 job
 cuts,


actually
 a
 poor
 example.
 Uh
 you'd
 be


wondering
 why
 would
 be
 I'd
 be
 getting


laid
 laid
 off.
 The
 same
 for
 a
 lot
 of


these
 other
 tech
 companies
 when


Microsoft
 is
 spending,
 you
 know,
 x


amount
 of
 dollars
 on
 dealing
 with
 OI
 or


other
 firms
 like
 Nebi,
 for example,
 to


build
 out
 data
 centers.
 Why
 are
 they


cutting
 jobs?


>> It
 is
 it
 is
 one
 of
 those
 things,
 right,


where
 it's
 like,
 all
 right,
 all
 these


data
 center
 jobs
 and
 data
 center


ecosystems
 around
 AI
 is
 what
 we
 need
 for


the
 next
 leg
 up.
 But
 if
 we're
 having


these
 layoffs,


can
 that
 next
 leg
 up
 actually
 take
 place


the
 way
 people
 think
 it
 needs
 to
 take


place?
 Palanteer
 right
 there.
 Still


trying
 to
 push
 198.
 And
 I
 don't
 think


anyone
 has
 an
 answer
 for
 this.


I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 take
 a
 lot
 of
 time


before
 we
 fully
 understand
 the
 impacts


of
 the
 labor
 market.
 75%
 of
 you
 said
 no


on
 the
 kombucha.


Thank
 you.


It's
 disgusting,
 dude.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


understand
 why
 people
 drink
 it.
 Google


Google
 alltime
 highs.
 Wow.
 Okay,
 so


let's
 do
 this
 poll.
 Let's
 do
 this
 poll.


Google
 270.
 What
 stock
 are
 we
 the
 most


excited
 for
 today
 on
 earnings?


What
 stock
 are
 we
 the
 most
 excited
 for


today
 on
 There's
 a
 bunch
 of
 companies,


but
 what
 stock
 are
 you
 the
 most
 excited


for?
 Google,
 Microsoft,
 or
 Meta?


We're
 Google's
 call
 will
 be
 at
 4:30.
 So,


we're
 going
 to
 try
 to
 listen
 to
 Google's


call
 and
 then
 go
 into
 the
 rest
 of
 them.


But,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 reporting


today.
 So,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 mad
 uh


madness,
 but


we're
 going
 to
 try
 to
 see
 as
 much
 as
 we


can


and
 do
 that.
 Uh
 BMR
 doing
 layoffs.


Nokia.
 Speaking
 of
 Nokia,
 what
 Jensen


had
 to
 say
 yesterday
 about
 Nokia
 and
 why


they
 they
 dropped
 billion
 into
 the


company


>> kind
 of
 speaks
 for
 itself.
 Um
 there
 was


a
 time
 where
 Nokia
 was
 already
 looking


to
 America.
 You
 you've
 been
 in
 the
 role


since
 April,
 but
 may
 I
 start
 by
 asking


you
 what
 role
 the
 administration
 played


in
 bringing
 you
 both
 together
 if
 this
 is


indeed
 a
 strategic
 priority.


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 think
 there
 was
 anything


specific
 that
 the
 administration
 did


other
 than
 they've
 created
 the


environment
 to
 support
 innovation.
 I


mean,
 Jensen's
 talked
 about


manufacturing,
 but
 it's
 also
 about
 R&D


and
 innovation
 and
 technology


leadership.
 And
 if
 you
 think
 about
 where


this
 world
 is
 going
 and
 all
 those


incredible
 devices
 are
 going
 to
 be
 built


on
 NVIDIA
 platforms,
 robotics,


autonomous
 vehicles,
 you
 know,
 augmented


reality,
 virtual
 reality,
 we
 need
 a


different
 kind
 of
 network
 in
 the
 future.


And
 that's
 what
 we
 realized
 and
 that's


why
 we
 wanted
 to
 forge
 this
 partnership


so
 that
 we're
 building
 a
 network


leveraging
 AI
 for
 AI
 services.
 And


that's
 really
 the
 big
 change
 here.


>> And
 the
 technology
 is
 flowing
 both
 ways.


I
 mean,
 what
 is
 it
 that
 you
 will
 be
 able


to
 do
 with
 Nokia?
 Um,
 Jensen,
 you


weren't
 able
 to
 do
 on
 your
 own.


>> Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 Nokia
 is
 in
 all
 of


the
 world's
 base
 stations
 and
 this


airscale
 platform
 of
 Nokia
 is
 in


millions
 of
 base
 stations
 around
 the


world.
 If
 our
 computers
 are
 not
 inside,


>> Malas
 just
 come
 out
 said
 we
 see
 a
 path


to
 800
 billion
 in
 Nvidia
 revenues
 by


2030.


Price
 target
 raised
 to
 300.


This
 is
 why
 Nvidia
 is
 making
 a
 move


today.


>> That
 base
 station
 doesn't
 help.
 It's
 no


different
 than
 Nvidia's
 tech
 computing


platforms
 not
 inside
 a
 car
 doesn't
 help.


And
 so,
 so
 the
 first
 thing
 is
 we
 need
 a


partner
 to
 get
 us
 into
 the
 world
 space


stations.
 We
 also
 remember
 we're


bringing
 AI
 to
 radio
 networks,
 AI
 to
 RAM


so
 that
 we
 can
 make
 wireless
 tech


communications
 a
 lot
 more
 efficient.


Second,
 we're
 bringing
 AI
 for
 the
 radio,


meaning
 on
 top
 of
 these
 radio
 networks


and
 these
 telecommunication
 network,


we're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 provide
 AI


services,
 which
 is
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


make
 it
 easier
 for
 us
 to
 do
 robotics
 and


autonomous
 vehicles
 and
 industrial


automation
 and
 reach
 all
 of
 the


different
 places
 around
 the
 world.


That's
 kind
 of
 hard
 to
 do
 with
 Wi-Fi.


Cellier
 reads
 everything.
 And
 so,
 we
 now


have
 this
 fabric
 that
 we
 can
 deploy
 AI


computing
 services
 on
 top
 of.
 It's
 going


to
 be
 completely
 revolutionary.


>> Okay,
 so
 you've
 got
 Jensen
 making
 the


argument
 for
 why
 they
 should
 be


investing
 in
 Nokia.
 Again,
 they
 only


have
 uh
 50
 billion
 in
 cash
 only.
 So,


it's
 like
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 buy
 back


their
 stock,
 right?
 They're
 going
 to


have
 to
 invest
 in
 other
 companies.
 And


it
 looks
 like
 that's
 why
 Nvidia's
 been


making
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 strategic


investments.
 Tesla
 goes
 red,
 Hood
 goes


red,
 Pouncer
 still
 holding
 196,
 S&P
 68,


Nvidia
 down
 from
 the
 highs
 at
 212
 to


209.
 but
 still
 holding
 the
 200s.
 Grab


gapping
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 604.
 Google


continuing
 to
 hit
 alltime
 highs
 at
 270.


Uh
 Trump
 will
 be
 planning
 to
 meet
 the


Hungarian
 premier
 on
 November
 8th.


So
 he
 just
 met
 the
 Japanese
 prime


minister.
 He
 met
 the
 South
 Korea


president
 today.
 He's
 meeting
 Xi


tomorrow.
 And
 now
 it
 looks
 like
 he's


going
 to
 be
 being
 the
 Hungarian
 premier


on
 November
 8th
 as
 he
 continues
 to
 meet


some
 of
 these
 world
 leaders.


Going
 back
 to
 the
 labor
 market.
 So,


here's
 a
 couple
 charts
 that
 uh
 that
 Uzi


sent
 me
 right
 here
 that
 I
 think
 is


really
 interesting.
 So,
 take
 a
 look
 at


this.
 Since
 the
 launch
 of
 LLMs,
 aka


Chatbt,


senior
 professional
 headcount
 has


consistently
 outpaced
 juniors,
 aka
 if


you're
 a
 junior
 level
 analyst
 or
 junior


level
 engineer.
 We're
 looking
 at
 2023


when
 CHACH
 launched
 end
 of
 22.


The
 blue
 line
 is
 seniors.
 The
 red
 line


is
 juniors.
 And
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people


that
 are
 just
 entering
 into
 the
 job


market
 probably
 feel
 this
 happening


right
 now
 because
 there's
 just
 not
 as


much
 demand
 for
 junior
 level
 jobs.
 Then


you
 see
 right
 here
 headcount
 over
 time


by
 age
 group
 for
 software
 developers.


The
 senior
 ones
 are
 picking
 up
 the
 most


level
 of
 continued
 headcount.
 Whereas


early
 career,
 that
 uh
 light
 blue
 line


you're
 seeing
 right
 there
 is
 dropping


off
 a
 cliff.
 That's
 really
 dropping
 off


a
 cliff
 from
 22
 October
 all
 the
 way
 down


to
 2025.
 And
 then
 headcount
 overtime
 by


age
 group
 for
 customer
 service


normalized
 continue
 to
 see
 early
 career


this
 is
 22
 to
 25.
 Early
 career
 is
 22
 to


25.
 Early
 career
 uh
 or
 like
 I
 guess


early
 career
 but
 not
 as
 early
 as
 26
 to


30.
 Mid-career
 is
 35
 to
 40
 and
 then


senior
 is
 50
 plus
 41
 to
 49
 is
 mid-career


2.
 You
 can
 see
 the
 early
 career
 one
 and


twos.
 They're
 falling
 off
 a
 cliff
 from


where
 they
 were.
 The
 slope
 of
 the
 lines


are
 relatively
 the
 same
 from
 21
 to
 22.


And
 then
 you
 get
 to
 see
 the
 divergence


as
 you
 get
 into
 2025.


I'm
 30,
 but
 I'm
 early
 career.
 Which


group
 am
 I?
 You
 are
 early
 career
 2.
 So


you're
 not
 22
 to
 25,
 but
 you
 are
 still


in
 the
 early
 parts
 of
 your
 career.
 I


mean,
 I
 saw
 this
 chart
 yesterday
 as


well,
 and
 it
 does
 make
 sense,
 right?


like
 as
 LLMs
 continue
 to
 launch,
 you


might
 not
 need
 junior
 level
 jobs.
 I


mean,
 we
 were
 dude,
 there
 was
 a
 let
 me


see
 if
 I
 can
 find
 this.
 There
 was
 a
 um


there
 was
 a
 report
 of
 someone
 who
 told


Anthropic
 to
 basically
 they
 they
 created


this
 massive
 prompt.
 You
 know,
 some
 of


these
 prompts
 that
 take
 that
 take
 the


LLM
 like
 an
 hour,
 multiple
 hours
 to
 work


through.
 They
 created
 this
 prompt
 and


the
 idea
 was
 to
 tell
 Anthropic
 to
 become


as
 good
 as
 Jane
 Street
 when
 it
 comes
 to


analyzing
 stocks
 and
 like
 hedging.


And
 it's
 kind
 of
 crazy,
 right?
 Because


it's
 like
 it
 didn't
 end
 up
 working,
 but


eventually
 like
 the
 LLM
 will
 be
 able
 to


model
 stocks
 and
 valuations
 better
 than


the
 best
 junior
 analyst
 coming
 out
 of
 a


prestigious
 business
 school
 will
 be
 able


to
 do.


And
 so
 you
 you you
 could
 see
 the


divergence
 happening
 in
 a
 more


aggressive
 way.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 what


some
 of
 these
 charts
 are
 showing.
 Amazon


right
 there
 is
 still
 green.
 229
 alphabet


270.4.


Continuing
 to
 go
 green.
 Doug
 says,
 "I


have
 a
 friend
 who
 works
 on
 cars
 and


drives
 Door
 Dash.
 He
 is
 not
 a
 computer


guy,
 but
 he
 built
 an
 app
 using
 AI
 alone


and
 it
 went
 on
 sale
 in
 the
 Apple
 App


Store
 yesterday."
 And
 that's
 the
 beauty


of
 AI.
 It's
 giving
 everyone
 opportunity,


right?
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 some
 fancy


software
 engineer
 that
 studied
 for
 four


years.
 You
 could
 just
 tell
 the
 bot
 how


to
 do
 it
 and
 then
 it
 does
 it.
 And
 then


you
 just
 have
 to
 be
 good
 at
 marketing,


which
 is
 also
 really
 hard.
 But
 it's
 not


like
 you
 you
 have
 to
 hire
 someone,
 you


know,
 for
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of


dollars
 to
 build
 the
 tech.
 But
 it
 does


mean
 everything
 gets
 more
 competitive.


Everything
 gets
 more
 competitive.


Amit,
 is
 Grinder
 recruiting
 you?
 Okay.


You
 know
 what?


No,
 they
 are
 not
 recruiting
 me.


They're
 getting
 taken
 private
 soon


anyway.
 So,


>> I
 don't
 think
 they
 would
 be
 recruiting


that
 much
 anyway.
 But
 it's
 crazy,
 right?


Like
 this
 is
 actually
 crazy.
 The
 amount


of
 divergence
 we're
 seeing
 in
 the
 labor


market
 is
 not
 something
 I
 think
 we
 can


ignore.
 Let's
 get
 an
 update
 right
 here


on
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 China
 and
 then


we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> Our
 Aean
 Jav
 in
 Washington
 with
 more
 as


we
 continue
 to
 digest
 the
 news
 out
 of


the
 Japanese
 meeting.
 Aean,
 and
 the


South
 Korean
 meeting.


>> Yeah,
 good
 morning
 Carl.
 President
 Trump


arrived
 in
 South
 Korea
 overnight
 and
 he


met
 with
 President
 Lee
 of
 South
 Korea


during
 the
 Apex
 Summit
 there.
 That's
 not


me.
 That's
 them.


This
 is
 the
 third
 time
 this
 week
 someone


in
 CNBC
 had
 their
 phone
 go
 off
 during


the
 uh
 during
 being
 on
 live
 TV.
 It's
 not


me.
 It's
 them.


>> He
 was
 presented
 with
 the
 nation's
 high


honor
 medal
 for
 contributions
 to
 South


Korean
 national
 security
 and
 given
 a


replica
 of
 a
 historic
 crown
 as
 a


personal
 gift
 from
 the
 South
 Korean


president.
 Trump
 and
 the
 South
 Korean


leader
 quashed
 hopes
 though
 of
 a
 meeting


with
 North
 Korean
 leader
 Kim
 Jong-un


with
 Trump
 saying
 the
 timing
 simply


didn't
 work
 out
 on
 that
 uh
 for
 this


trip.
 But
 he
 did
 have
 some
 positive


things
 to
 say
 ahead
 of
 tomorrow's
 widely


anticipated
 meeting
 with
 Xiinping
 which


is
 actually
 going
 to
 happen
 at
 about
 10


or
 11
 p.m.
 East
 Coast
 time
 uh
 here
 in


the
 United
 States
 tonight.
 Take
 a


listen.


The
 president
 of
 China
 is
 coming


tomorrow
 here
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 I


hope
 making
 a
 deal.
 I
 think
 we're
 going


to
 have
 a
 deal.
 I
 think
 it'll
 be
 a
 good


deal
 for
 for
 both
 and
 that's
 really
 a


great
 result.
 You
 know,
 that's
 better


than
 fighting
 and
 going
 through
 all


sorts
 of
 problems
 and
 you
 know,
 no


reason
 for
 it.
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be


a
 great
 deal
 for
 both.


>> The
 two
 leaders
 also
 spoke
 about
 the


prospect
 for
 nuclearpowered
 submarines


for
 South
 Korea,
 joint
 ship
 building


efforts
 and
 manufacturing
 in
 the
 United


States.
 Despite
 that
 upbeat
 rhetoric


though,
 the
 two
 sides
 were
 not
 able
 to


conclude
 a
 comprehensive
 trade
 deal.
 The


US
 and
 South
 Korea
 developed
 a
 framework


for
 a
 deal
 earlier
 in
 the
 year,
 but


they've
 not
 been
 able
 to
 finalize
 it


because
 South
 Korean
 officials
 have


balked
 at
 President
 Trump's
 demand
 for


$350
 billion
 in
 investment
 into
 the


United
 States,
 which
 they
 worry
 could
 be


destabilizing
 for
 the
 South
 Korean


economy.
 The
 White
 House
 did
 announce


this
 morning
 tens
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars


in
 investment
 commitments
 uh
 today,


including
 49.9
 billion
 from
 Korean
 Air


and
 a
 $3
 billion
 investment
 from
 Korean


energy
 firm
 LS
 Group.
 President
 Trump


also
 attended
 what's
 build
 as
 a
 special


presidential
 dinner
 for
 heads
 of
 state


and
 government
 uh
 which
 was
 also


attended
 by
 other
 leaders
 who
 were
 in


town
 for
 the
 APEC
 uh
 meetings
 including


those
 from
 Vietnam,
 Australia,
 New


Zealand,
 Canada,
 Thailand,
 and


Singapore.
 So,
 a
 whirlwind
 diplomatic


visit.
 Carl,
 back
 over
 to
 you.


>> Aean,
 I
 am
 curious
 what
 you
 made
 of
 some


of
 the
 push
 back
 from
 Koreans,
 whether


you
 thought
 that
 was
 related
 to
 the


Hyundai
 controversy
 from
 a
 couple
 of


months
 ago.
 And
 in
 Japan,
 Takahichi


saying
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 very
 hard


for
 them
 not
 to
 purchase
 more
 Russian


LG.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 you
 you
 get
 the
 sense
 that


some
 of
 these
 leaders
 are
 sort
 of
 up


against,
 you
 know,
 just
 real
 economic


constraints
 as
 they
 talk
 to
 the
 Trump


administration.
 They
 want
 to
 have
 a
 good


meeting.
 They're
 they're
 going
 out
 of


their
 way
 with
 pomp
 and
 circumstance.
 I


mean,
 what
 we've
 seen
 in
 terms
 of
 the,


you
 know,
 the
 honor
 guards,
 the


giftgiving,
 the
 the
 sitdowns,
 the


praise,
 you
 know,
 all
 of
 that


extraordinarily
 lavish
 and
 welcoming
 for


President
 Trump.
 But
 on
 some
 level,
 uh


there's
 only
 so
 much
 they
 seem
 to
 feel


they
 can
 do
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 the


investments
 and
 the
 commitments
 that
 the


president
 wants.
 And
 that's
 why
 we're


seeing
 a
 lot
 of these
 frameworks
 being


announced
 with
 details
 to
 be
 filled
 in


later.
 uh
 as
 we
 saw
 in
 the
 South
 Korean


situation
 that
 you
 know
 they
 are


announcing
 investments,
 they're


announcing
 engagement
 uh
 but
 you
 wonder


how
 much
 of
 that
 is
 the
 kind
 of


investment
 and
 engagement
 that
 would


have
 happened
 between
 these
 two


relatively
 large
 economies
 anyway.


>> Yeah,
 framework
 certainly
 seems
 to
 be


the
 word
 of
 the
 moment.
 Aean,
 thank
 you.


>> You
 bet.


>> Morgan
 Stanley
 is
 strengthening
 its
 push


into
 private
 markets
 today.
 The
 firm


announcing
 it
 will
 acquire
 Equity
 Zen,
 a


trade.


>> All
 right,
 so
 uh
 that's
 the
 update
 on


China.
 This
 was
 Trump,
 by
 the
 way,
 last


night
 talking
 about
 uh
 Nvidia.


>> If
 you
 look
 at
 Davidia,
 Nvidia
 is
 doing


unbelievable.
 We're
 bringing
 a
 lot
 of
 a


lot
 of
 uh
 the
 Taiwan
 business
 back
 to


the
 United
 States.
 I
 think
 by
 within
 2


years,
 I
 think
 we'll
 have
 40
 to
 50%
 of


the
 chip
 market.
 But
 that's
 happening.


And
 I
 don't
 know,
 it's
 happening
 because


of
 the
 tariffs.
 It's
 also
 happening


because
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 probably
 Maybe


they're
 a
 little
 bit
 concerned
 about


things.
 Who
 knows?


>> But
 they
 are
 they
 are
 you
 know


tremendous
 I
 don't
 know if
 you're


reporting
 it
 but
 massive
 numbers
 of
 and


percentages
 of
 the
 chip
 business
 is


coming
 back
 right
 now
 as
 we
 speak.


>> He
 then
 went
 on
 to
 say
 that
 you
 know


he's
 going
 to
 talk
 to
 Xi
 about


Blackwell.
 So


that
 seems
 relatively
 bullish
 for
 Nvidia


but
 we
 got
 to
 see
 what
 this
 deal
 looks


like
 going
 into
 tomorrow.
 Pouncer
 still


holding
 197
 folks.
 She
 got
 really
 close


to
 198,


but
 not
 officially
 there
 yet.


Not
 there
 yet.


Uh,
 Jensen
 gained
 9
 billion


in
 personal
 wealth
 over
 the
 past
 24


hours.


Jensen,
 I
 think
 he
 has
 like
 I
 don't
 know


how
 many
 shares,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 like


90
 million
 shares
 or
 something
 like


that.


It's
 a
 decent
 chunk.
 He
 has
 been
 selling


along
 the
 way.
 But
 yeah,
 this
 is
 why


looking
 at
 the
 insider
 selling
 argument,


it's
 just
 never
 the
 best
 argument.
 It's


only
 a
 good
 argument
 if
 the
 company's


not
 executing.
 If
 the
 company's
 not


executing
 and
 insiders
 are
 cashing
 out,


that's
 different.
 If
 the
 company's


putting
 up
 growth,
 like
 people
 are
 going


to
 take
 profits.
 It's
 the
 nature
 of
 a


market.
 But
 if
 you
 said
 Nvidia,
 you


know,
 Jensen
 was
 selling
 at
 170,


therefore
 it's
 bearish,
 it's
 like


it's
 not
 the
 best
 argument
 to
 be
 making.


Yeah,
 Morgan
 Stanley
 is
 acquiring


equities
 and
 Morgan
 Stanley
 stock
 right


there
 that
 is
 slightly
 flat
 on
 the
 day.


Nothing
 too
 crazy
 for
 them.


Matt,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Appreciate
 you
 being
 here.
 Uh,
 thanks


for
 the
 daily
 content.
 Your
 guidance
 has


helped
 me
 over
 the
 past
 two
 years
 since


starting
 up.
 Up
 239%
 alltime
 high
 and
 up


142%
 year
 to
 date
 from
 knowing
 nothing


to
 understanding
 earnings
 reports
 and


basic
 economics
 in
 the
 market.
 Chat
 is


the
 best.
 Matt,
 congrats.
 Absolutely


incredible.
 And
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here


every
 day.
 We
 did
 a
 year-to-
 date
 update


yesterday
 in
 the
 chat
 on
 the
 close
 and
 I


mean
 most
 people
 are
 pushing
 triple


digits
 or
 very
 close.
 You
 know
 I
 think


80
 to
 90
 was
 the
 average
 which
 is
 just


incredible.


And


now
 we
 just
 got
 to
 see
 if
 that
 can


continue
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


BMR
 we
 still
 flat.
 We
 are
 still
 flat.


Have
 people
 given
 up
 on
 BMR?
 What
 are


people
 thinking?
 because
 three
 weeks
 ago


the
 excitement
 was
 way
 higher
 than
 it
 is


right
 now.
 I
 still
 have
 my
 entire


position.
 I
 still
 like
 dude,
 it's
 it
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 that
 hard
 of
 a
 hold
 if


you
 believe
 in
 what's
 happening
 at
 the


intersection
 of
 blockchain
 and
 Wall


Street.
 And
 when
 I
 mean
 blockchain,
 I


mean
 Ethereum
 as
 the
 deacto
 blockchain


that
 Wall
 Street's
 choosing.


But
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 it
 is
 crypto,


right?
 Crypto
 is
 going
 to
 go
 up.
 Crypto


is
 going
 to
 go
 down.
 And
 if
 you
 want
 a


micro
 strategy
 type
 of
 return,
 you've


got
 to
 kind
 of
 be
 with
 it
 in
 the
 dog


days.


Uh
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 thesis
 on
 Ethereum


is
 necessarily
 false.
 It
 could
 it
 could


end
 up
 not
 playing
 out,
 but
 I
 think


there's
 just
 more
 than
 enough
 evidence


to
 say
 that
 it's
 likely
 going
 to
 play


out.
 It
 just
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 BMR
 is,


you
 know,
 going
 to
 go
 to
 the
 moon
 if


Ethereum
 doesn't
 go
 to
 the
 moon.


But
 also,
 there's


a
 ton
 of
 call
 premium
 on
 this.


So,
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 a
 couple


people
 yesterday
 who
 said,
 you
 know,
 I


don't
 really
 care
 that
 much
 about


Ethereum
 or
 BMR,
 but
 I'm
 getting
 12%
 in


two
 weeks.
 Like,
 if
 the
 stock
 stays
 flat


in
 this
 range,
 then
 like
 I'm
 just


stealing
 money
 from
 people
 at
 this


point.
 I'm
 like,
 yeah,
 I
 mean,
 that's


it's
 a
 horrible
 argument.
 Also,
 the


Clarity
 Act,
 that's
 correct.
 That's
 also


something
 that
 we've
 got
 to
 wait
 till
 it


gets
 passed,


but
 it's
 going
 to
 take
 time.


Kind
 of
 annoying
 when
 ETH
 being
 flat.
 I


agree.
 But
 when
 ETH
 runs,
 you
 know,
 you


definitely
 get
 a
 run.
 At least
 that's


what
 we've
 seen
 before.
 Capitulation


also
 could
 be
 interpreted
 as
 bullish.


That
 is
 correct.
 You
 could
 be
 getting
 a


bit
 of
 a
 coil
 up.
 I
 mean,
 I
 mean,
 in


video,
 dude,
 I
 had
 to
 literally
 talk
 my


dad
 out
 of
 selling
 Nvidia
 on
 Sunday.
 He


was
 like,
 I'm
 thinking
 of
 selling.
 I'm


like,
 why?
 He's
 like,
 because
 it's
 been


stuck
 between
 like
 175,
 180,
 185.
 My
 dad


has
 900
 shares
 of
 Nvidia.
 And
 I
 was


like,
 dad,
 just
 like
 it's
 in
 like
 he


doesn't
 care.
 He
 doesn't
 understand


Nvidia.
 He's
 just
 looking
 at
 the
 price


action.
 I
 had
 to
 kind
 of
 explain
 it's


like
 this
 is
 the
 most
 important
 company


when
 it
 comes
 to
 AI.
 You
 can't
 just
 sell


them
 because
 you're
 annoyed
 at
 the
 price


action.


So
 yesterday
 he
 was
 happy,
 but
 it's
 like


sometimes
 you
 just
 really
 got
 to
 stick


with
 a
 thesis
 for
 it
 to
 play
 out.


Where's
 Meta?
 Where's
 Meta?
 Oh,
 what
 did


you
 guys
 say
 on
 the
 poll?
 Did
 you
 guys


say
 Google?
 Did
 you
 guys
 say
 Google?


What
 did
 we
 say
 on
 the
 poll?
 Honestly,


Google
 is
 the
 one
 I
 am
 really
 excited


about
 because
 they've
 already
 had
 this


massive
 run
 and
 I
 think
 search
 might


continue
 to
 go
 better.
 Wow,
 61%
 you
 said


Google.
 Yep,
 it's
 the
 goops.


Okay,
 so
 let's
 do
 another
 question.


The
 other
 question
 is
 uh


what


what
 is


what
 is
 uh
 what
 was
 the
 question?
 What


oh
 yeah
 which
 which
 one
 do
 you
 own?


Which
 one
 do
 you
 own
 the
 most
 of?


Google,
 Meta,
 Amazon.


Yeah,
 we
 don't
 need
 to
 do
 a
 fourth


option.
 Google,
 Meta,
 or
 Amazon.
 Which


one
 do
 you
 own
 the
 most
 out
 of?
 For
 me


right
 now,
 it's
 Amazon.
 For
 me
 right


now,
 it's
 I
 don't
 own
 any
 Meta.
 I
 have
 a


little
 bit
 of
 Google,
 but
 Amazon's
 the


big
 one.


So,
 I'm
 curious
 what
 people
 are
 thinking


here.


Um,
 yeah,
 Caterpillar
 is
 moving.
 We


covered
 that
 this
 morning.
 That
 one's


doing
 great.
 Pounder,
 I
 do
 think
 198
 is


still
 on
 the
 table,
 dude.
 It's
 close.


19740.


Maybe
 we
 get
 there.


Oh,
 I
 put
 Amazon.
 I
 was
 supposed
 to
 put


Microsoft.
 My
 bad.
 Let
 me
 do
 it
 again


because
 the
 the
 earnings
 are
 today.


Sorry.
 Okay.
 Which
 one


do
 you
 own
 the
 most
 of?
 Google,
 Meta,


Microsoft.


Dude,
 what
 if
 Microsoft
 is
 the
 one
 that


outperforms
 everything?
 Like
 Microsoft


always
 is
 so
 disrespected


compared
 to
 the
 other
 stocks.
 Like
 what


if
 they
 just
 show
 up
 and
 they're
 like,


"Yeah,
 no
 one's
 messing
 with
 Azure.
 S&P


688,
 Nvidia
 208,
 Palanteer
 197.


Microsoft
 is
 down
 on
 the
 day,
 which
 is
 a


good
 setup
 going
 into
 earnings
 as
 well.


538


I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 give
 all
 the
 option


unless
 you
 own
 them
 all
 equal
 weighted.


I
 mean,
 how
 many
 people
 own
 a
 similar


amount
 of
 all
 three
 of
 them?
 I
 would


imagine
 there's
 probably,
 you
 know,


people
 own
 one
 more
 than
 the
 other.
 I


feel
 like
 most
 of
 you
 would
 say
 Google


over
 the
 other
 two.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of


you
 guys
 that
 own
 Meta.


Met
 your
 favorite
 stock,
 Sherwin


Williams,
 pumped
 5%
 yesterday.


Sherwin
 Williams


down
 1%
 today.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 it's
 my


favorite
 stock,


but
 for
 those
 that
 own
 it,
 there
 you
 go.


Do
 they
 have
 earnings?
 I
 don't
 I
 feel


like
 we
 didn't
 cover
 their
 earnings.


Yeah,
 you
 did
 get
 a
 move
 yesterday
 up


5%.


Um,


dude.
 Okay,
 so
 the
 robot
 came
 out


yesterday
 from
 NEO.
 That
 thing
 got
 a
 ton


of
 pre-orders.


I
 don't
 know
 how
 I
 feel
 about
 this


robot,
 dude.


>> It's
 officially
 out.
 You
 can
 pre-order


it
 for
 $20,000.


>> Let
 you
 live
 with
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 just
 now
 telling
 me,
 "Well,
 what


does
 it
 do?"


>> Like
 my
 chores


>> would
 help
 humanity
 explore
 the
 galaxy.


And
 I
 really
 hope
 that
 when
 you
 get
 your


Neo
 now,
 we
 can
 help
 give
 you
 back
 some


of
 that
 time
 so
 you
 can
 really
 spend
 it


on
 what
 you
 feel
 is
 very
 meaningful
 to


you.


>> Okay.
 Can't
 listen
 to
 the
 music.
 But
 I


mean,
 I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 I
 don't
 know.


I
 guess
 this
 thing
 is
 like
 what's


getting
 a
 lot
 more
 people
 excited.


Look,
 if
 it
 if
 it
 works
 out,
 it's
 great.


I
 just
 think
 all
 the
 other
 robot
 company


Look,
 here's
 the
 thing.
 All
 the
 other


robot
 companies
 are
 not
 shipping
 robots


yet.
 I'm
 confused
 why
 these
 guys
 are


shipping
 robots
 or
 why
 they're
 getting


ready
 to
 ship
 robots.
 And
 so
 I
 my
 mind


goes
 to
 two
 thoughts.
 Number
 one
 is
 wait


a
 second,
 are
 these
 guys
 better
 than


everyone
 else
 including
 Tesla?


Or
 are
 these
 guys
 full
 of
 [ __ ]
 and


they're
 putting
 out
 a
 crappy
 product


that
 they're
 trying
 to
 say
 is
 like
 the


next
 evolution
 of
 robot?
 Because
 none
 of


the
 other
 companies
 have
 actually


developed
 models
 that
 are
 good
 enough


for
 the
 robot
 to
 meaningfully
 do
 stuff


in
 the
 home.
 You're
 telling
 me
 this


company
 from
 Norway
 has
 figured
 it
 out


before
 Tesla?


Yeah,
 first
 to
 market
 doesn't
 mean
 the


best.
 That's
 also
 true.


I
 mean,
 the
 only
 other
 companies
 that


are
 really
 shipping
 robots
 are
 in
 China.


Not
 that
 many
 American
 companies
 have


meaningfully
 put
 out
 or
 I
 guess
 you


should
 say
 Western
 companies
 have
 put


them
 out.


So,
 I'm
 just
 wondering
 like
 how
 good
 is


it?
 And
 if
 it
 is
 that
 good,
 that
 is
 kind


of
 bearish.
 Figure,
 Tesla,
 electronic,


all
 the
 American
 companies
 that
 keep


showing
 all
 these
 fancy
 videos,
 but
 they


can't
 get
 anything
 into
 the
 home,
 right?


Like
 if
 Neo's
 actually
 doing
 it,
 then


then
 maybe
 it's
 a
 bit
 different.


>> Chili
 peppers
 and
 you
 could
 put
 cayenne


in
 your
 chili,
 but
 it
 is
 much
 spicier.


>> Neo
 is
 a
 speech
 enabled
 AI
 companion


made
 for
 any
 kind
 of
 conversation.
 Where


other
 AI
 assistants
 are
 confined
 to
 your


phone
 or
 computer,
 Neo
 lives
 with
 you
 in


your
 physical
 space
 and
 has
 the
 ability


to
 see,
 hear,
 and
 remember
 things
 about


your
 surrounding
 environment
 to
 provide


you
 with
 uniquely
 helpful
 assistance.


For
 example,
 it
 can
 suggest
 what
 to
 cook


based
 on
 what
 you
 have
 in
 the
 fridge,


remember
 your
 progress
 while
 teaching


you
 a
 new
 language,
 and
 even
 give
 you


interior
 design
 advice.
 The
 gestures
 and


the
 light
 rings
 express
 Neo's


intentions.
 Its
 audio
 intelligence
 can


also
 pick
 up
 on
 whether
 you
 are


addressing
 it
 or
 someone
 else
 in
 the


room
 to
 decide
 if
 it
 should
 respond
 or


not.
 As
 you
 might
 expect
 from
 a
 home


robot,
 talking
 to
 Neo
 with
 natural


language
 is
 the
 primary
 user
 interface


for
 all
 of
 Neo's
 functionality,


including
 autonomy.


Your
 Neo
 comes
 with
 Redwood
 AI,
 enabling


it
 to
 do
 basic
 household
 tasks


autonomously.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 for
 sure.
 Okay.
 Now
 again,


they're
 not
 shipping
 it
 yet.
 As
 Doug


says,
 they
 are
 they're
 going
 for


pre-order.
 Oh,
 I
 think
 Paler's
 trying
 to


do
 it.


Wait,
 did
 we
 hit
 198?


Oh
 [ __ ]
 we
 did,
 dude.
 No,
 no
 one
 in
 the


chat
 said
 anything.


No
 one
 in
 the
 chat
 said
 anything.
 We


were
 too
 busy
 with
 the
 robot.


We
 hit
 198.
 We
 did
 it,


dude.
 I'm
 looking
 at
 the
 iPad
 right
 now.


I
 see
 one
 comment.


Loica
 Cule
 Canman
 said
 Palanter
 198
 and


then
 Marcus
 Patrick
 said
 198.


Okay,
 two
 three
 of
 you
 and
 then
 Min
 said


198.
 And
 then
 uh
 one
 other
 person
 and
 no


one
 else
 was
 spamming
 198
 so
 I
 didn't


see
 it.
 There
 you
 go
 folks.
 Busted


through
 198.
 We
 hit
 19818.


19818.


Okay,
 you
 can't
 say
 so
 many.
 I'm
 looking


at
 the
 chat.
 I
 see
 five
 people
 that
 said


it.
 the
 rest.
 Everyone
 else
 was
 talking


about
 the
 video.


Well,
 there
 it
 is.
 198.
 There
 you
 go.


All right.
 So,
 let's
 check
 199.
 Let's


check


Let's
 check
 199.


And
 what
 we
 need
 to
 get
 199
 resistance,


folks,
 is
 38,000
 shares
 at
 200.


238,000.


200
 is
 2


38,000.


Damn,
 bro.


This
 is
 crazy.


This
 is
 actually
 freaking
 crazy.


This
 is
 just
 wild.
 Absolutely
 wild.
 What


a
 freaking
 journey.


What
 a
 freaking
 journey.
 For
 those
 that


missed
 Karp
 and
 Jensen
 yesterday,
 uh
 we


won't
 listen
 to
 the
 whole
 thing,
 but


here's
 some
 of
 the
 stuff
 that
 that
 Karp


had
 to
 say
 on
 this
 interview.


>> We're
 overestimating
 the
 benefits
 of


this
 AI
 buildout
 in
 the
 near
 term,
 which


is
 reflected.


>> Let
 me
 sorry
 here.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 push


back
 on
 this
 narrative.
 It's
 not
 First


of
 all,
 AI
 makes
 America
 the
 dominant


country
 in
 the
 world.
 So,
 just
 start


there.
 every
 other
 country
 in
 the
 world,


like
 I
 spent
 half
 my
 life
 in
 Europe,


they're
 whining
 and
 crying
 and
 it
 it's


like
 we
 have
 the
 right
 chips,
 we
 have


the
 right
 software,
 we
 have
 the
 right


engineers,
 we
 have
 the
 right
 culture,
 we


have
 the
 right
 people,
 the
 risk


appetite,


>> risk
 appetite,
 right
 people
 to
 ask


questions.
 Uh
 the
 whole
 thing
 is


combining
 to
 become
 a
 juggernaut
 and


then
 and
 and
 then
 and
 like
 then
 you


these
 these
 these
 partnerships
 happen


and
 that
 just
 throws
 gasoline
 on
 the


fire
 se.
 The
 classic,
 the
 real
 question


is
 will
 the
 GDP
 growth
 acrew
 to
 all


Americans
 or
 just
 wealthy
 Americans?
 And


the
 answer
 to
 that
 is
 it
 depends
 what


you
 do.
 But
 I
 deeply
 believe
 I
 think
 we


deeply
 believe


>> well
 no
 manufacturing
 jobs


>> can
 you
 build
 if
 you
 build
 manufacturing


jobs
 which
 is
 what
 this
 president
 wants


to
 do.
 Can
 you
 build
 them?
 Yes.
 How
 do


you
 build
 them?
 You
 need
 AI.
 Can
 you


train
 the
 people?
 Can
 you
 upscale
 them?


Yes.
 If
 you
 use


>> mechanicals,
 electricals
 and
 plumbers


and
 construction.


>> You
 can
 tell
 Karp
 was
 excited
 there.


balance
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 198
 and
 as


a
 result
 of
 that
 excitement
 um
 you
 know


you're
 seeing
 the
 stock
 really
 have
 an


impact
 based
 on
 that
 partnership
 with


Nvidia.
 Nvidia
 is
 still
 holding
 208


as
 well.
 All
 right,
 back
 to
 the
 the
 NEO


video.


>> Can
 you
 get
 the
 door,
 please?


>> I
 got
 to
 turn
 off
 the
 audio,
 guys.
 The


music
 is
 there.
 There
 it
 is.
 It's


grabbing
 the
 door.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 this


thing
 looks
 like
 like
 a
 guy
 in
 a
 suit.


It
 doesn't
 even
 look
 like
 a
 robot,
 which


I
 know
 is
 kind
 of the
 point
 of
 these


robots,
 but


again,
 they're
 not
 shipping
 it
 yet.


They're
 taking
 the
 pre-orders,
 which
 is


a
 question
 of
 just
 like,
 "All
 right,
 how


long
 will
 it
 take
 the
 ship,
 grabbing
 the


cup,
 and
 then
 walking
 the
 cup
 to
 the


kitchen,
 and
 then
 putting
 it
 away?"


Neo's
 autonomy
 improves
 with
 diverse


data
 and
 real
 world
 experience.


>> I
 don't
 know,
 bro.
 I
 don't
 know.


We
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 this
 demo
 looked


like.
 Yeah,
 it
 was
 someone
 controlling


it.
 Was
 it
 neural
 nets?
 Like
 has
 anyone


read
 the
 white
 paper
 on
 this
 robot?


Because
 I
 haven't
 seen
 any
 documentation


on
 like
 how
 do
 they
 train
 the
 models?


Are
 they
 using
 vision
 action
 models?
 Are


they
 using
 general
 purpose
 LLMs?
 How
 do


how
 are
 the
 act
 the
 actu
 the
 actuators


and
 actu
 the
 actuator
 is
 the
 most


important
 hardware
 when
 it
 comes
 to


building
 a
 robot
 and
 Brett
 and
 Elon
 have


talked
 about
 this
 for
 a
 long
 time
 like


where
 are
 they
 sourcing
 their
 actuators


from?
 How
 are
 they?
 Like
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 questions
 about
 this
 that
 I
 feel
 like


are
 unknown,


but
 they're
 offering
 it
 for
 a
 pre-order.


I
 feel
 like
 to
 just
 kind
 of,
 you
 know,


get
 people
 to
 think
 they're
 moving
 fast.


And
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 know
 when
 it's


going
 to
 happen.
 Wall
 Street
 Journal


says
 his
 video
 is
 remotely
 operate.


Didn't
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 did
 a
 piece?


I
 think
 they
 did
 a
 piece
 on
 this


yesterday.


Yeah,
 obviously
 they
 use
 Nvidia.
 They


have
 the
 Nvidia
 chips,
 but
 it's
 not
 just


a
 lot
 of
 this
 comes
 down
 to,


as
 when
 I
 interviewed
 Brett,
 a
 lot
 of
 it


comes
 down
 to
 how
 do
 you
 make
 the


hardware
 and
 software
 work
 together
 in
 a


way
 that
 makes
 the
 robots
 conducive
 to


the
 training
 of
 the
 chips.


Um,


yeah,
 I'm
 looking
 at
 Wall
 Street
 Journal


right
 now.
 They're
 saying
 it
 was
 remote


operated.


The
 X1
 Neo,
 one
 of
 the
 first
 humanoid


robots
 built
 for
 your
 home.


There's
 an
 article
 right
 here
 saying
 it


looks
 like
 it
 was
 remote
 operated.


We
 can
 watch
 the
 piece
 on
 it
 later,
 but


it
 looks
 like
 and
 for
 a
 demo
 they


probably
 wanted
 to
 make
 it,
 you
 know,
 as


strong
 as
 possible.
 Palinger
 is
 still


holding
 197,


which
 is
 why
 you
 might
 be
 seeing
 that.


Yeah,
 we
 did
 hit
 19818
 on
 Palunteer.


Um,


Amazon
 231
 that
 goes
 back
 to
 going


green.
 Reddit
 that's
 still
 down.
 Grab


green
 on
 the
 day.
 And
 then
 Google's


still
 holding
 270
 as
 well.
 That
 reminds


me
 of
 the
 Nicola
 EV
 semi
 scam
 from
 a


couple
 years
 ago.
 There's
 dev
 someone
 in


that
 robot
 suit.


And
 even
 if
 there's
 not,
 I
 just
 feel


like
 we
 need
 more
 technical
 details
 on


how
 they're
 building
 this
 S&P


68874.


Here
 was
 another
 interview
 with
 Jensen


yesterday
 talking
 to
 some
 different


parts
 of
 the
 media.


>> Blackwell
 specific
 licenses
 from
 the
 US


government
 to
 sell
 to
 China
 right
 now.


And
 do
 you
 expect
 to
 receive
 any?


>> Uh
 we
 we
 haven't
 asked
 for
 any.
 Uh
 we


just
 we're
 currently
 we
 just
 let
 uh
 let


the
 Chinese
 government,
 the
 United


States
 figure
 out
 exactly
 how
 we're


going
 to
 serve
 uh
 address
 China
 in
 the


future,
 but
 currently
 I'm
 assuming
 it's


zero.


>> The
 president
 said
 he
 wants
 to


congratulate
 you.
 Do
 you
 know
 what
 he


wants
 to
 congratulate
 you
 for?


>> GTC.


No,
 I
 I I
 well
 first
 of
 all
 um
 I
 I
 think


I
 think
 he
 wants
 to
 congratulate
 me
 for


uh
 manufacturing
 United
 States
 that
 we


did
 it
 at
 light
 speed.
 It
 took
 us
 9


months
 from
 the
 moment
 that
 President


Trump
 encouraged
 us
 to
 manufacture


United
 States
 to
 set
 up
 um
 all
 of
 our


manufacturing
 here.
 We've
 got
 wafer


manufacturing,
 packaging,
 system


manufacturing,
 and
 we're
 building
 AI


factories.
 And
 so
 that's
 going
 to
 create


lots
 and
 lots
 of
 jobs
 here
 in
 the
 United


States.
 How
 many
 hours
 will
 you
 with


him?


>> Okay,
 pounders
 moving
 again.


Alltime
 high
 is
 19840.


>> Dude,
 she
 wants
 200.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 she


wants
 it
 today,
 but
 she
 wants
 200o,


dude.
 Kind
 of
 crazy.
 Kind
 of
 crazy
 on
 a


day
 like
 this.
 We
 have
 all
 this
 stuff


going
 on.

 tech,
 FOMC,


and
 you
 got
 Palanter
 trying
 to
 go
 for


200.


All right.
 What
 is
 everyone
 doing
 right


now?
 Put
 in
 the
 chat,
 what
 are
 you


doing?
 Like,
 where
 are
 you?
 Are
 you
 at


work?
 Are
 you
 at
 home?
 Are
 in
 the


background?
 If
 you're
 in
 the
 chat,
 what


are
 you
 doing


besides
 staring
 at
 the
 screen
 at
 Pounder


and
 Nvidia?
 Look,
 by
 the
 by
 the
 way,


take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 I
 just
 saw
 this


right
 now.

Look
 at
 what
 they
 just
 put
 on
 LinkedIn.


While
 we
 were
 demoing
 Nvidia
 AI
 with


pounderontology,
 this
 happened
 and
 he


puts
 the
 Nvidia
 and
 Pounder

together.


That
 could
 be
 a
 reason
 why
 Nvidia
 and


Pounder
 popping
 at
 the
 same
 time
 at
 GTC.


You
 have
 Nvidia
 and
 Palanteer
 showing


their
 demo
 together.


And
 that
 could
 be
 creating,
 you
 know,
 a


lot
 more
 excitement
 around
 kind
 of
 what


is
 happening
 with
 these
 two
 companies


and
 why
 they're
 working.


It's
 pretty
 damn
 incredible.

 I

like

 everyone's
 here
 from

the

 right?
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 AFDE


demo
 yet.
 Hopefully,
 we
 get
 the
 video
 of


it.
 But
 it
 looks
 like
 it's
 definitely


getting
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 excited
 as
 well.


I'm
 in
 the
 Dubai
 hotel

 I'm


walking

 Dude,
 is
 that
 not
 crazy
 that


people
 are
 all
 across
 the
 world
 doing


something
 different
 right
 now?


We're
 all
 looking
 at

 to
 be

 I

Dude,
 it's

 I
 me
 I
 meant

 I
 said

 Like
 it
 is
 what


it

It
 is
 what
 it
 is.


I'm
 at
 Ruckers
 New
 Brunswick.
 Okay.
 I


love
 it.
 Alma
 Mater.
 That's
 just
 so


crazy,
 bro.
 People
 are
 across
 the
 world.


And
 it's
 not
 just
 Palent.
 It's
 just
 this


entire
 year
 has
 been
 quite
 incredible.


But
 also
 given
 the
 move
 Nvidia
 and


Pounder
 are
 making
 today.


That's
 wild,
 bro.
 I
 almost
 didn't
 own


Nvidia,
 bro.
 I
 almost
 didn't
 own
 it.
 I


was
 still
 on
 that,
 oh,
 it's
 a
 cyclical


thing
 back
 in
 January.


And
 it
 took
 Tanner
 and
 Deepseek
 at
 the


same
 time
 to
 really
 get
 me
 to
 be
 like,


screw
 it.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 I
 literally
 look


at
 this
 tweet
 from
 freaking
 January


30th.
 This
 is
 when
 it
 this
 is
 when
 it


just
 kept
 going
 down
 and
 like
 wouldn't


get
 any
 recovery.


I
 was
 just
 like,
 "All
 right,
 we're
 going


down
 with
 the
 ship.
 We
 are
 going
 down


with
 the
 ship
 at
 this
 point.


And
 thankfully,
 you
 know,
 you
 had
 some


pretty
 good
 earnings
 growth
 since
 then.


We
 need
 to
 look
 at
 Adobe
 here.


Dude,
 I
 don't
 hate
 Adobe's
 numbers.
 I


just
 like
 I
 want
 to
 buy
 Canva.
 I
 am


excited
 for
 them
 when
 Canva
 goes
 public


because
 I
 think
 they're
 much
 more


adaptive
 in
 the
 age
 of
 AI.
 Here's
 the


thing
 about
 Adobe,
 right?


Like
 I
 am
 really
 I'm
 genuinely
 scared


about
 getting
 into
 a
 name
 that
 becomes
 a


PayPal.
 Genuinely
 scared
 about
 getting


into
 a
 name
 that
 because
 once
 you're
 in


that
 name
 and
 you've
 done
 all
 the
 due


diligence
 and
 you
 believe
 it's
 going
 to


work
 and
 like
 you
 know
 you're
 like
 you


obviously
 know
 it's
 undervalued
 and


stuff
 and
 then
 it
 does
 nothing.
 The


reason
 the
 SoFi
 bulls
 were
 able
 to


persist
 through
 the
 massive
 bull
 run
 we


had,
 but
 SoFi
 was
 stuck
 at
 $8
 was


because
 there
 was
 growth
 and
 everyone


knew
 eventually
 the
 street
 has
 to


believe
 in
 that
 growth
 story
 eventually.


With
 PayPal,
 there's
 no
 growth.
 There's


just
 not
 growth
 or
 there
 is
 growth,
 but


it's
 not
 anywhere
 near,
 you
 know,
 30
 40.


It's
 not
 even
 near
 10%
 revenue.
 So,
 it's


like
 when
 you're
 in
 something
 that


doesn't
 grow
 in
 a
 market
 that
 deeply


cares
 about
 growth,
 but
 you're
 in
 it


because
 you
 think
 it's
 undervalued,
 it's


very
 scary
 to
 be
 stuck
 in
 that.
 Adobe


has
 8%
 revenue
 growth.
 Not
 horrible
 at


their
 size,
 but
 when
 I
 think
 of
 a
 Canva


or
 I
 think
 of
 a
 Sora
 or
 all
 these
 other


companies
 that
 will
 only
 make
 it
 harder


for
 Adobe
 to
 grow,
 just
 like
 all
 these


crypto
 companies
 are
 going
 to
 make
 it


harder
 for
 people
 to
 make
 PayPal
 over


other
 forms
 of
 payment.
 It's
 very
 scary


to
 be
 stuck
 in
 a
 name
 like
 that.


and
 and
 again
 the
 belief
 is
 that
 the


value
 will
 ultimately
 persist


but
 if
 the
 value
 doesn't
 persist
 like


and
 like
 you
 know
 here's
 the
 other


Dolingo
 has
 tons
 of
 growth
 but
 they
 have


a
 bad
 narrative.
 So
 there's
 so
 many


nuances
 when
 you
 like
 really
 get
 into
 an


investment
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 this
 one
 maybe


I'm
 bottom
 fishing,
 but
 I
 can
 ignore


this
 part
 of
 their
 narrative.
 I
 can
 look


to
 this
 part
 of
 the
 growth.
 I
 can
 ignore


these
 other
 issues
 because
 I
 believe
 in


its
 undervaluation."


When
 in
 reality,
 buying
 more
 pounder


Nvidia
 could
 be
 the,
 you
 know,
 buying


more
 Hood
 could
 be
 the
 like,
 and
 as


annoying
 as
 it
 is
 to
 hear
 that,
 it's


like
 that
 might
 be
 a
 better
 option
 in
 a


Super
 Bowl
 market.


So
 look,
 I
 think
 Adobe
 will
 do
 well.
 I


think
 PayPal
 will
 do
 well.
 But
 after


PayPal
 had
 a
 15%
 day
 and
 then
 it
 gets


destroyed
 the
 day
 after.
 And
 like
 look,


Fiserve
 is
 a
 stupid
 reason
 for
 it
 to
 go.


I
 mean,
 Fiser
 is
 not
 the
 same
 as
 PayPal.


I
 understand
 it's
 a
 sector
 specific


company,
 but
 if
 you
 can't
 hold
 even
 1%


of
 grain
 after
 yesterday
 because
 another


company
 falls
 45%.


It
 means
 the
 stock
 has
 a
 real
 problem


right
 now.
 Now
 that
 could
 also
 be
 where


the
 massive
 opportunity
 is,


but
 nonetheless,
 that
 that
 is
 the
 risk


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.


PayPal
 is
 down
 because
 their
 take
 rate


keeps
 decreasing.
 Not
 the
 same
 for


Adobe.
 They
 are
 utilizing
 Sora
 and
 VO


for
 mass
 marketing.
 Yeah,
 look,
 I
 have


not
 done
 a
 deep
 dive
 on
 Adobe.
 Maybe
 it


warrants
 doing
 it.
 I
 just
 know
 that


their
 topline
 revenue
 growth
 is
 not


exciting.
 And
 right
 now,
 you
 know,
 when


you
 got
 Nvidia
 growing
 50%
 of the
 street


really
 cares
 about
 growth.
 I
 mean,
 even


Salesforce,
 dude,
 Mark
 Benoff
 tried
 to


pump
 the
 stock
 by
 saying
 they
 would
 do


60
 billion
 by
 uh
 2030,
 rule
 of
 50,
 and


it
 kind
 of
 helped.
 It
 was
 at
 245,
 now


it's
 at
 250.
 But
 like
 60
 billion
 growth


is
 10%
 year-over-year.
 It's
 just
 not


super
 exciting.
 Is
 it
 undervalued
 even


with
 that
 growth
 rate?
 Yes,
 of
 course.


Same
 thing
 with
 Adobe,


but
 it's
 just
 not
 as
 exciting
 at
 the


moment.


Pounder
 getting
 rejected
 at
 198
 196,
 but


we
 did
 hit
 19840.
 All
 right,
 so
 we
 have


some
 coverage
 on
 Amazon.
 Let
 me
 pull


this
 up
 with
 their
 new


uh
 let's
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.
 Let's


see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 some
 updates
 on
 AWS
 as


well.


>> Today's
 tech
 check.
 Hey
 Mac.


>> Hey
 Leslie.
 So
 take
 a
 look
 at
 what


Amazon's
 AI
 land
 grab
 looks
 like.
 CNBC's


Katie
 Terasov
 and
 I
 got
 exclusive


firsttime
 access
 inside
 one
 of
 the


largest
 operational
 AI
 data
 centers
 in


the
 world
 built
 specifically
 for
 OpenAI


rival
 Anthropic.
 Now,
 an
 Amazon
 quietly


started
 scouting
 land
 in
 rural
 Indiana


in
 2022,
 and
 it
 was
 able
 to
 turn
 a
 corn


field
 into
 a
 hyperscale
 AI
 compound
 in


less
 than
 a
 year.
 One
 where
 Anthropic
 is


already
 training
 its
 models
 inside.


>> They're
 already
 running
 about
 500,000


chips
 uh
 in
 Indiana
 today.
 And
 in
 fact,


it's
 going
 so
 well
 that
 they've
 actually


doubled
 down
 on
 that
 order.
 And
 we


expect
 uh
 jointly
 we'll
 be
 running
 more


than
 a
 million
 tranium
 2
 chips
 by
 the


end
 of
 this
 year.


It's
 called
 Project
 Rainier.
 Amazon's
 11


billion
 dollar
 answer
 to
 OpenAI's


Stargate.
 And
 while
 Meta
 breaks
 ground


in
 Arkansas
 and
 XAI
 ramps
 up,


>> dude,
 they
 took
 a
 corn
 field
 and
 turned


it
 into
 a
 data
 center.


Anthropic's
 already
 utilizing
 it.
 I


mean,
 that
 is
 pretty
 incredible.
 And
 it


goes
 to
 show
 how
 much
 compute


constrained
 they
 are
 that
 they
 are


taking
 a
 corn
 field
 in
 Indiana
 and


turning
 it
 into
 a
 data
 center.
 This
 is


why
 Jensen
 says
 the
 opportunity
 is
 not


as
 small
 as
 some
 of the
 analysts
 would


think
 and
 why
 the
 projections
 continue


to
 get
 raised
 if
 companies
 are


transforming
 corn
 into
 data
 centers.


Yeah,
 it's
 kind
 of
 corny
 to
 be
 honest.


It's
 kind
 of
 corny.


Please
 laugh.


>> It's
 Colossus
 Supercomputer
 in
 Memphis.


Amazon
 is
 already
 online.


There
 is
 such
 demand
 for
 our
 models
 that


I
 think
 the
 only
 way
 we
 would
 have
 been


able
 to
 serve
 as
 much
 as
 we've
 been
 able


to
 serve
 so
 far
 this
 year
 is
 this


multi-chip
 strategy
 because
 new
 data


centers
 are
 coming
 online.
 We're
 getting


the
 capacity
 that
 we
 can
 wherever
 we


can.


>> Amazon
 is
 deploying
 capex
 faster
 than


its
 rivals.
 Exactly
 what
 the
 street
 is


looking
 for
 when
 the
 hyperscalers
 start


reporting
 after
 the
 bell
 today.
 Amazon


spending
 is
 neck
 andneck
 with
 Microsoft


which
 reports
 this
 afternoon
 and


investors
 want
 to
 know
 one
 if
 all
 that


spend
 has
 been
 worth
 it
 and
 then
 two


whether
 these
 cloud
 giants
 are
 going
 to


try
 to
 match
 OpenAI's
 $1.4
 trillion


worth
 of
 compute
 deals.
 Guys,
 Mac,
 I'm


curious
 if
 Indiana
 and
 these
 other


states
 that
 are
 seeing
 these
 big
 data


center
 footprints,
 are
 they
 offering


incentives
 for
 companies
 like
 Amazon
 to


be
 there
 and
 build
 in
 the
 corn
 fields?


Yes,
 it
 is
 those
 kind
 of
 traditional


data
 center
 incentives
 that
 you
 would


imagine.
 So,
 a
 mix
 of
 uh
 tax
 offsets,


but
 also
 what's
 driving
 a
 lot
 of
 these


hyperscaler
 customers
 to
 places
 like


Indiana
 is
 the
 ability
 to
 be
 able
 to


serve
 the
 workloads
 that
 they
 need.
 So,


Indiana's
 grid
 has
 a
 mix
 of
 different


energy
 inputs.
 We're
 talking
 nuclear,


gas.
 They're
 bringing
 more
 of
 these


sources
 online,
 and
 that's
 really
 what


they
 need.
 I
 mean,
 I've
 had


conversations
 with
 OpenAI
 where
 they
 say


that
 they
 care
 less
 about
 the
 the
 tax


breaks
 and
 more
 about
 whether
 they
 can


help
 them
 get
 to
 this
 33
 gawatt
 uh


compute
 commitment
 and
 that's
 the


equivalent
 of
 33
 nuclear
 reactors.


>> Yeah,
 as
 we
 talked
 with
 Caruso
 the
 other


day,
 not
 everybody
 can
 move
 to
 Virginia.


Uh
 some
 of
 these
 areas
 of
 the
 country


are
 pretty
 tapped
 out
 as
 far
 as
 the
 grid


goes.
 Fascinating
 look
 at
 Mac.
 Thank
 you


for
 that,
 Mackenzie
 Sagalos.
 when
 we


come
 back
 Sarah's
 conversation
 with


>> again
 that's
 kind
 of
 crazy
 bro
 that's


kind
 of
 freaking
 crazy
 a
 corn
 field
 into


data
 centers


but
 that
 is
 the
 level
 of
 demand
 that


persists
 here
 guys
 I
 think
 we're
 going


to
 get
 the
 Redcat
 CEO
 on
 in
 like
 10


minutes
 he
 just
 texted
 me
 he
 might
 be


able
 to
 come
 on
 Jeff
 Thompson
 so
 for


those
 that
 care
 about
 the
 drone
 space
 um


they
 just
 announced


a
 new
 platform
 with
 Palunteer
 so
 if
 he


hops
 will
 be
 able
 to
 talk
 to
 him


and
 we'll
 get
 some
 thoughts
 on
 what's


going
 on.
 Are
 we
 dumping
 on
 crypto?


Oh
 no,
 she's
 dumping.


Dude,


why
 can't
 people
 just
 hold
 their
 crypto?


Why
 do
 they
 have
 to
 sell
 it?
 Like,
 why


can't
 you
 just
 hold
 it?


Why
 can't
 people
 just
 hold
 it?
 By
 the


way,
 soybean


futures
 seeing
 some
 pretty
 big
 moves


right
 here.
 Highest
 move
 today
 since


October
 2024
 based
 on
 this
 China
 soybean


announcement.


So,


looks
 like
 the
 soybeans
 are
 doing
 okay.


Baron
 went
 short.
 Dude,
 Baron's
 worth


like
 500
 millie
 after
 going
 short
 crypto


before
 the
 Trump
 tweet,
 then
 long
 crypto


after
 that.
 Then
 he
 probably
 went
 long


Nvidia
 right
 before
 this
 China
 stuff.


It's
 got
 to
 be
 worth
 like
 three
 400


million,
 dude.


Three.
 Okay,
 let's
 ask
 this
 question.
 If


you
 had
 a hund00
 million,
 what's
 the


first
 thing
 you're
 doing?
 What's
 the


first
 thing
 you're
 doing?
 If
 you
 had
 a


hundred
 million,


what
 are
 you
 doing?


Baron
 is
 a
 smart
 trader.
 He
 loses
 He


learned
 his
 skills
 at
 NYU.
 Yeah,


exactly.


shorting
 Grab.


Oh
 my
 gosh,


you're
 getting
 a
 little bit
 of
 move
 on


Grab.


Earnings,
 baby.
 Earnings,
 earnings,


earnings.


Monday
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very
 important.


And
 if
 we
 get
 a
 bad
 earnings,
 uh,
 you


know,
 I
 might
 get
 my
 head
 chopped
 off,


but
 hopefully
 we
 get
 a
 good
 earnings
 and


I
 get
 to
 keep
 my
 head.


Um,


buying
 a
 Ferrari,
 send
 commit
 to
 English


school.


Bonds.
 Yeah,
 that's
 the
 most
 responsible


answer.
 And
 then
 Irwin
 said
 99
 million


to
 Rocket
 Lab.
 Yeah,
 that's
 not
 the
 most


responsible
 answer.


100
 million.
 The
 only
 reason
 I
 said
 that


number
 is
 because
 there
 there
 were
 some


Bloomberg
 articles
 saying
 that
 Baron's


net
 worth
 is
 now
 150
 million,
 which
 is


kind
 of
 crazy,
 but
 like
 you
 could


imagine.
 Buy
 a
 Wendy's
 spicy
 chicken


sandwich.


Proving
 that
 the
 time
 is
 not
 currently


right
 now.


Buy
 a
 mid
 and
 make
 him
 my
 butler.


Buying
 a
 100
 million
 worth
 of
 spy.
 I


feel
 like
 if
 we
 all
 had
 100
 million
 like


we
 would
 we
 would
 be
 able
 to
 really


manage
 a
 portfolio
 because
 like
 like
 I


don't
 know
 I
 just
 feel
 like
 with
 a
 if


someone
 gave
 me
 100
 million
 I
 could
 do


some
 damage
 with
 it.
 Now
 granted
 I
 would


hope
 it's
 my
 100
 million
 versus
 because


you
 don't
 want
 to
 managing
 other


people's
 money
 is
 just
 scary
 but
 if
 you


had
 your
 own
 100
 million


I
 feel
 like
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 ways
 to


navigate
 the
 markets
 with
 it


even
 if
 we're
 picking
 individual
 stocks.


Obviously,
 there's
 a
 lot
 more
 risk
 when


you're
 dealing
 with
 that
 much
 more


money,
 but
 still


Microsoft
 down.
 Not
 sure
 why
 Microsoft


dropping
 again.
 They
 had
 that
 opening


eye
 apprentip
 yesterday.
 Microsoft
 down


1%.
 I
 kind
 of
 like
 that
 setup
 going
 into


earnings.
 We
 do
 have
 Microsoft
 going


down.
 We
 get
 JPAL
 in
 about
 a
 couple


hours
 and
 we'll
 get
 the
 decision
 at
 2
 PM


to
 see
 what
 plays
 out.


Could
 live
 off
 daily
 cover
 call
 income


and
 keep
 it
 all
 in
 index
 funds.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 ways
 to
 navigate
 100


million


Broadcom.


That
 one's
 still
 moving.


Wow.
 Broadcom
 alltime
 high
 is
 382.


Broadcom,
 Nvidia,
 and
 Pounders.
 And
 then


a
 couple
 of these
 other
 names
 seem
 to
 be


holding
 up
 the
 S&P.
 But
 S&P
 again,
 if


Meta,
 Microsoft,
 Google
 give
 us
 a
 hit,


maybe
 7,000
 is
 not
 as
 far
 away.
 Hunter


196
 and
 Nvidia


208
 on
 the
 day.


I
 will
 stop
 watching
 you
 if
 I
 have
 100


million.


That's
 a
 fair
 point.


That's
 a
 fair
 point.
 I
 don't
 buy


Ethereum
 because
 I
 can't
 stake
 it.
 I


can't
 stake
 it
 in
 New
 Jersey.


So,
 that's
 why
 it's
 hard.
 Also,
 again,
 I


I
 like
 the
 crypto
 derivative
 plays
 more


than
 buying
 crypto
 in
 of
 itself.
 Maybe


next
 year
 we
 start
 like
 a
 DCA
 into


Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 in
 general,
 but
 I


feel
 like
 there's
 a
 way
 to
 get
 exposure


without
 having
 to
 be
 in
 those
 assets.


It's
 just
 this
 month
 has
 not
 been
 the


best
 for
 them.
 Bitcoin
 right
 there


111.7.


I'd
 give
 you
 a
 $20
 super
 chat.
 I


appreciate
 that.


I
 would
 appreciate
 that.
 By
 AK
 Media,
 we


have
 B
 we
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we
 have
 BMR


earnings
 today.
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 do.


We're
 going
 to
 see.


Uh,
 I
 think
 it's
 November
 5th.
 Wow,


Dualingo.
 It's
 getting
 wrecked,
 bro.


Goodness
 gracious.
 275.
 This
 is
 why
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 win
 this
 freaking
 stock


draft


with
 Matt.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Matt's
 at
 48.


I'm
 at
 45
 because
 of
 this
 stupid
 green


owl


that
 everyone
 thinks
 Apple's
 going
 to


destroy
 with
 Google.


Like
 why


why
 does
 that
 have
 to
 happen?


NJ
 is
 such
 a
 weird
 place.
 You
 can't
 pump


gas.
 You
 can't
 stay
 deep.


Will
 you
 tokenize
 AK?
 I
 don't
 think


we'll
 ever
 tokenize
 AK
 media.
 Probably


not.


You
 know,
 you
 know
 the
 funny
 thing
 about


this?
 I
 I I
 said
 this
 a
 long
 time
 ago,


but
 I'm
 like,
 if
 I
 had
 100
 million,
 I


feel
 like
 I
 would
 still
 do
 the
 show


every
 day.
 And
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people


say,
 why
 would
 you
 do
 the
 show
 if
 you


have
 that
 much
 money?
 It's
 like
 we
 I


just
 love
 doing
 the
 show.
 Like
 it's
 not


even
 about
 the
 money
 there.
 In
 fact,
 I


feel
 like
 the
 show
 would
 be
 more
 fun,


dude.
 We
 could
 freaking
 like
 buy
 10,000


shares
 of
 a
 stock
 before
 earnings.
 You


know,
 we
 could
 do
 a
 bunch
 of
 like
 I
 feel


like
 it
 would
 be
 even
 more
 fun
 if
 that


was
 the
 case.


But
 I
 just
 love
 doing
 it
 so
 much
 every


day
 that
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 would
 change


anything.
 All right,
 folks.
 We
 got


someone
 backstage.
 Let's
 bring
 them
 on.


It's
 been
 a
 couple
 months
 and
 I've
 since


I've
 spoke
 to
 them.
 Uh,
 a
 lot
 of
 you


guys
 have
 been
 interested
 in
 his
 company


and
 uh,
 well,
 his
 stock
 is
 not
 doing
 too


bad.
 Up
 about
 120%
 over
 the
 past
 six


months.
 Latest
 partnership
 with
 Pounder.


Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 Mr.
 Jeff
 Thompson


of
 Redcat.
 Jeff,
 what's
 up?


Uh,
 Jeff,
 we
 can't
 hear
 you.


If
 you
 click
 on
 the


if
 you
 click
 down
 um
 on
 the
 mic


arrow.
 Okay,
 he'll
 be
 back.


And
 then
 we'll
 get
 Jeff.
 And
 then
 we'll


get
 Jeff.


Dude,
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 are
 are


into
 Redcat
 and
 the
 drone
 names.
 And


that's
 another
 drone
 company
 that's


taken
 off.
 So,


we'll
 get
 Mr.
 Jeff's
 thoughts.
 Dude,


Chad
 was
 supposed
 to
 be
 on
 today,
 but


Chad
 just
 told
 me
 he
 got
 busy
 because
 he


has
 a
 big
 meeting.
 But
 he
 was
 supposed


to
 be
 on
 today
 as
 well.
 I
 wanted
 to
 talk


to
 him
 about
 this
 Nvidia
 pounder
 thing.


Maybe
 we'll
 try
 to
 get
 him
 tomorrow
 if


he
 can't
 make
 it
 today.


Mitch's
 gonna
 blame
 Streamyard.
 Now,
 I


don't
 have
 to
 blame
 Streamyard.
 Jeff
 can


blame
 Streamyard,
 but
 it
 always
 is


Streamyard's
 fault.
 It
 usually
 always
 is


Streamyard's
 fault.


Um,
 UMAC
 is
 up
 as
 well.


This
 is
 another
 drone
 company
 if
 I'm
 not


wrong.
 Unusual
 machine.
 Oh
 yeah,
 they


got
 a
 partnership.
 Didn't
 they
 get
 uh


didn't
 Yeah,
 they
 they
 got
 a
 partnership


yesterday
 for
 the
 massive
 purchase


agreement


from
 one
 of
 the
 government
 agencies,


Unusual
 Machines.
 That
 one
 is
 up
 7%


on
 the
 day.
 Yes,
 Jeff
 is
 on
 UMX
 board,


correct?
 Jeff
 is
 on
 UMX
 board.


Look,
 he's
 just
 texting
 me.
 He's
 going


to
 click
 it
 again.


Yo,
 Tanner
 and
 I
 were
 talking
 about
 this


yesterday
 that
 StreamYard
 really
 needs


to
 make
 things
 way
 more
 intuitive
 for


people.
 Like,
 there's
 so
 many
 parts
 of


it
 that
 are
 just
 so
 bad,
 but
 it's
 the


only
 platform
 that's
 out
 there.


That's
 why
 it
 needs
 to
 get
 better.


Hypertronics
 says,
 "Letting
 you
 know
 you


have
 fans
 from
 Singapore.
 I'm
 very


looking
 forward
 to
 coming
 to
 Singapore


hopefully
 in
 July
 next
 year.
 I
 have
 a


meeting
 this
 week
 to
 start
 planning
 more


of
 the
 meetups.
 Singapore
 is
 on
 the
 list


and
 it
 should
 be
 fun


in
 July
 of
 2026.


Should
 be
 a
 good
 time.


Um,


come
 to
 Chicago.


Yeah,
 Chicago's
 also
 definitely
 on
 the


list.
 There's
 there's
 actually
 a
 decent


amount
 here
 in
 Chicago
 as
 well,
 which


will
 be
 good.
 Tanner
 says,
 "Shreenards


and
 OBS
 don't
 work
 well
 for
 having


people
 on
 the
 stream."
 Yeah,
 exactly.


It's
 like
 there's
 just
 a
 lot
 of


complications
 with
 those
 two,
 especially


if
 you're
 like
 having
 guests,


but
 you
 know,
 ultimately
 we're
 going
 to


see
 hopefully
 if
 this
 one
 can
 get
 a
 bit


better.
 All right,
 let's
 try
 it
 again.


There
 he
 is.


>> What's
 up?


>> Can
 you
 hear
 me?


>> I
 can
 hear
 you
 loud
 and
 clear.


>> All
 right,
 had
 to
 switch
 to
 traditional


mic
 on
 my
 MacBook.
 So,
 we're
 good
 now.


>> You're
 good.
 You're
 crispy.
 We
 can
 hear


you.
 How
 are
 you
 doing?
 It's
 been
 it's


been
 about
 seven
 months
 since
 we've


talked.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 well,
 if
 you've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of


the
 stuff
 we're
 doing,
 we're
 super
 busy.


Um
 right
 after
 last
 time
 we
 hung
 out,
 I


think
 it
 was
 the
 AIPCON,
 but
 uh
 we


launched
 a
 uh
 a
 USV
 business
 for
 boats.


Uh
 we
 partnered
 with
 a
 uh
 European


company
 to
 do
 the
 tech
 stack
 and
 we


brought
 a
 lot
 of
 superstars
 on
 to
 build


the
 hulls,
 which
 have
 been
 building


hulls
 for
 generations.
 and
 um
 launched


155,000
 square
 feet
 in
 Georgia
 uh
 to


build
 these
 boats.
 Uh
 and
 uh
 we
 keep


winning
 stuff
 with
 our
 traditional
 Black


Widow
 that
 just
 came
 out.
 This
 is
 the


Black
 Widow
 hat
 right
 here.


>> I
 still
 have
 mine.
 Yep,
 I
 got
 mine.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 we're
 uh
 you
 know,
 we're


getting
 there.
 We're
 we're
 we're


building.
 We're
 building.
 And
 uh
 you're


going
 to
 see
 the
 first
 uh
 you're
 finally


going
 to
 see
 some
 revenue
 ramp
 out
 of


all
 these
 momentum
 stocks.
 And
 uh
 I
 hope


to
 be
 the
 first
 one
 out
 of
 the
 gate.


Okay.
 So,
 let's
 talk
 about
 what
 happened


this
 week
 or
 what
 you're
 guys
 are
 ready


to
 announce
 with
 Palunteer.
 What
 is
 kind


of a
 new
 partnership?
 And
 and
 what
 is
 is


it
 a
 platform?
 Is
 it
 a
 product?
 How
 are


you
 guys
 kind
 of
 thinking
 of
 it?
 Yeah,


it's
 a
 product
 that
 we
 got
 together
 with


Palunteer
 late
 last
 year
 and
 it's
 uh
 to


uh
 what
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 problems
 that


the
 Department
 of
 War
 has
 is
 all
 these


everyone's
 talking
 about
 drone


dominance,
 but
 one
 of
 the
 key
 issues


that
 we
 keep
 hearing
 about
 uh
 from
 our


customers
 are
 that
 there's
 no
 such
 thing


as
 a
 an
 environment
 where
 GPS
 will
 work


ever
 again
 in
 a
 battlefield.
 So,


Palunteer
 has
 a
 a
 product
 that
 we
 uh


we're
 the
 first
 company
 they
 put
 it
 on


uh
 that
 has
 any
 uh
 scale
 or
 uh
 that


actually
 is
 going
 to
 be
 productized
 uh


for
 something
 that
 has
 a
 program
 of


record
 with
 the
 US
 Army,
 which
 is
 the


short-range
 reconnaissance
 program
 of


record.
 Um
 so,
 we
 now
 have
 visual


navigation
 from
 Palunteer.
 They


integrated
 onto
 the
 Black
 Widow.
 Um
 we


got
 it
 to
 a
 point
 where
 we
 liked
 it.
 We


finally
 did
 some
 finalized
 uh


demonstrations
 and
 it
 performs
 just
 just


as
 good
 as
 a
 GPS.
 We
 were
 able
 to


perform
 missions
 uh
 without
 GPS
 uh
 last


week
 and
 uh
 now
 it's
 we're
 offering
 it


for
 sale
 as
 a
 partnership
 uh
 revenue


share
 between
 us
 and
 Palanteer.


So,
 let's
 talk
 about
 the
 drone
 space


because
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 companies,
 as


you
 mentioned,
 some
 of
 these
 momentum


stocks
 that
 have
 literally,
 you
 know,
 5


to
 10x
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 months
 as


the
 Department
 of
 War
 uh
 is
 getting
 a


lot
 more
 interested
 in
 pursing
 these


drones.
 What
 is
 your
 take
 on
 the
 the


macro
 landscape
 of
 the
 industry?
 And
 how


much
 of
 a
 vital
 role
 do
 you
 think
 the


the
 Trump
 administration
 is
 going
 to


play
 in
 terms
 of
 supporting
 a
 lot
 of


those
 drone
 companies?


Yeah.
 Well,
 anybody
 who's
 been
 paying


attention
 since
 2022
 has
 realized
 that


uh
 you
 know,
 drones
 have
 changed


warfare.
 No
 one
 can
 dispute
 that.
 Now,


finally,
 the
 US
 is
 not
 disputing
 it.
 Not


only
 for
 people
 like
 me
 that
 understand


it,
 but
 the
 uh
 the
 Department
 of
 War,


this
 new
 administration
 came
 in
 really


strong.
 They
 put
 executive
 orders
 for


drone
 dominance.
 They
 put
 an
 executive


order
 for
 ship
 building,
 which
 were


we're
 part
 of
 both.
 And
 then
 uh
 you


know,
 Secretary
 Hegsth
 came
 in
 and
 put


out
 a
 video
 talking
 about
 how
 we,
 you


know,
 go
 faster
 with
 drone
 dominance.


And
 uh
 so
 we
 really
 have
 supported
 this


administration


uh
 to,
 you
 know,
 build
 lots
 of
 drones


because
 we
 were
 way
 behind.
 Well,
 we


we're
 still
 way
 behind.
 Um
 but
 the
 the


technology
 gaps
 that
 we
 have,
 we
 can


overcome
 so
 quickly.
 Like
 for
 instance,


this
 this
 partnership
 with
 Palunteer


that
 we
 just
 did,
 uh
 we
 literally
 have


GPS
 capabilities
 without
 a
 GPS.
 So
 if


you
 know
 anything
 about
 flying
 drones
 in


a
 stressful
 environment,
 when
 you
 don't


have
 a
 GPS,
 even
 for
 a
 drone
 that
 needs


a
 GPS,
 it's
 like
 flying
 FPV.
 And
 FPV
 is


when
 you
 use
 the
 goggles,
 it's
 like


you're
 a
 real
 pilot.
 It's
 very


stressful.
 You
 can't
 not
 pay
 attention.


You
 can't
 just
 cruise
 around
 like
 you
 do


on,
 you
 know,
 a
 real
 estate
 drone,


right?
 So
 if
 you
 have
 GPS
 capabilities,


you
 can
 the
 it
 can
 help
 you
 fly
 the


drone.
 So
 you're
 not
 when
 your
 cognitive


load
 isn't
 staring
 at
 the
 screen.
 Oh
 my


god,
 I
 got
 I
 can't
 miss
 two
 seconds
 or


I'm
 going
 to
 crash
 this
 drone.
 So
 it


really
 helps
 there.
 Our
 our
 drones
 are


also
 been
 tested
 for
 electronic
 warfare.


Uh
 so
 then
 the
 next
 step
 that
 we're


looking
 at
 with
 Palunteer
 is
 to
 put
 on


their
 product
 uh
 Maven
 onto
 the
 Black


Widow,
 which
 would
 give
 us
 a
 drone
 that


fits
 in
 your
 rucks
 sack
 on
 your
 back


that's
 probably
 pretty
 much
 as
 capable


as
 a
 Reaper
 MQ9
 or
 something.
 There's


probably
 more
 technology
 in
 your
 rucks


sack
 than
 you
 would
 be
 in
 a
 Reaper
 that


can't
 even
 fly
 over
 Ukraine.


from
 a
 from
 a
 visual
 navigation


perspective
 and
 then
 all
 the
 data
 being


compiled
 uh
 via
 Foundry
 for
 these


drones.
 Do
 you
 think
 there
 are
 like


other
 software
 providers
 that
 are
 easily


enabling
 that
 or
 is
 the
 reason
 you're


working
 with
 Pounder
 because
 the


integration
 is
 just
 really
 seamless?


>> Well,
 there
 there's
 two
 things.
 They


they've
 got
 a
 lot
 more
 access
 to
 their


uh
 Well,
 let
 me
 just
 back
 up
 a
 little


bit.
 There's
 a
 million
 companies
 out


there
 trying
 to
 do
 visual
 navigation.


The
 problem
 is
 the
 example
 I
 always
 use


is
 Gaza,
 right?
 Everyone
 does
 this.


Basically,
 they
 match
 maps.
 Sometimes


they're
 using
 Google
 Maps,
 which
 even


without
 a
 war
 are
 so
 old
 they
 they


aren't
 accurate
 and
 and
 could
 screw
 up.


But
 to
 use
 a
 real-time
 example,
 you
 go


to
 Gaza
 during
 the
 war,
 every
 day
 that


that
 map
 is
 different.
 So,
 if
 you're


trying
 to
 compare
 your
 what
 your
 cameras


are
 seeing
 to
 the
 map,
 it's
 not
 going
 to


work.
 So,
 if
 you
 can't
 have
 that,
 then


the
 the
 drone
 you
 have
 is
 a
 brick.
 It's


a
 waste
 of
 time.
 you're
 you
 you've
 lost


money
 if
 you
 got
 a
 $30,000
 drone
 that


you're
 supposed
 to
 be
 using
 in
 in
 the


battlefield.
 That
 drone
 could
 become


useless
 uh
 if
 it
 can't
 work.
 So,


Palanteer
 has
 access
 to
 their
 customers


uh
 you
 know,
 real-time
 satellites.
 Uh


so,
 that's
 a
 huge
 advantage
 to
 get
 new


maps
 onto
 the
 drone,
 which
 nobody
 else


has
 that
 capability.
 So,
 that
 that's


that
 that's
 one.
 Second
 is,
 you
 know,
 as


this
 is
 tied
 into,
 we're
 also
 uh
 in
 the


early
 stages
 of
 warp
 speed
 for
 our
 first


factory.
 We
 have
 a
 factory
 in
 Salt
 Lake


City.
 They're
 implementing
 warp
 speed


and
 now
 we're
 actually
 going
 to
 be


putting
 more
 chunks
 of
 their
 software


into
 that
 facility.
 Uh
 we're
 also
 in
 the


the
 large
 factory
 in
 uh
 Georgia.
 We're


going
 to
 be
 implementing
 warp
 speed


there.
 And
 then
 our
 Long
 Beach
 facility,


which
 makes
 our
 longer
 range
 drones,


will
 be
 also
 getting
 the
 Palunteer's


software.
 So
 having
 our
 drones
 be
 built


with
 this
 software,
 giving
 us
 more


efficiencies,
 allowing
 us
 to
 get
 better


margins
 like
 other
 customers
 that
 are


using
 this
 less
 waste
 uh
 can
 bring
 up


our
 yields,
 which
 also
 increases
 your


margins.
 Um,
 so
 there's
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


stuff
 where
 we're
 going
 to
 be


cross-pollinating
 between
 not
 only


visual
 navigation,
 putting
 Maven
 on
 our


drones
 for
 artificial
 intelligence,
 um,


and
 and
 having
 having
 their
 their
 their


backend,
 their
 basically
 factory


operating
 system
 running
 our
 business.


>> Can
 you
 speak
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 this


partnership,
 Redcat
 and
 Paladine
 to


embed
 AI
 into
 the
 teal
 drones?


>> Yeah,
 so
 we
 look
 at
 ourselves
 as
 a
 as
 an


iPhone.
 Um,
 and
 every
 mission
 is


different
 for
 different
 customers,


whether
 it's
 the
 Marines,
 Air
 Force,
 who


whoever
 it
 might
 be.
 And
 what
 we
 look
 to


do
 is,
 uh,
 we
 we're
 an
 open
 platform.


So,
 if
 you've,
 if
 you've
 got
 some


integration
 you
 want
 to
 do
 on
 on
 the


Black
 Widow
 and
 you
 have
 some
 customers


that
 are
 requesting
 it,
 then
 we
 will


actually
 do
 that
 integration.
 We're
 not


just
 going
 to
 integrate
 with
 everybody.


We'd
 be
 spend
 all
 our
 time
 integrating


with
 every
 every
 small
 company
 out


there.
 But
 Paladine
 has
 some
 great


software
 that
 also
 does
 some
 interesting


swarming
 and
 artificial
 intelligence
 and


they
 have
 some
 direct
 paths
 to
 some


customers.
 Uh
 and
 so
 that
 also
 makes
 the


Black
 Widow
 more
 valuable
 to
 the


customers
 they're
 pitching
 our
 product


to
 with
 their
 software
 on
 it.
 So
 we
 do


that
 with
 many
 many
 different
 vendors
 uh


on
 our
 on
 our
 drone.
 Also
 we
 do


something
 with
 SafePro
 which
 has
 been


doing
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 in
 Ukraine


identifying
 mines.
 Um,
 so,
 uh,
 you
 go


through
 a
 minefield.
 If
 you're
 a


soldier,
 you
 you
 probably
 want
 that


software
 to
 identify
 these
 mines
 if
 you


get
 across
 that
 field.
 Um,
 things
 of


that
 nature.
 We
 we
 do
 some,
 uh,
 3D


mapping
 on
 the
 edge
 with
 reveal.
 Um,
 we


work
 with
 Sighteline
 on
 also
 object


detection
 and
 targeting.
 Um,
 whatever


the
 whatever
 can
 complete
 the
 mission,


uh,
 we
 we
 can
 say
 to
 the
 army,
 hey,
 you


tell
 us
 what
 products
 you
 want
 here.
 And


lots
 of
 the
 times
 we're
 guided
 by
 the


Department
 of
 War
 of
 hey
 we're
 we're


we're
 dealing
 with
 uh
 this
 company
 XYZ.


We
 think
 it
 would
 be
 smart
 if
 you
 put


their
 platform
 on
 your
 platform.
 Uh
 and


uh
 we
 typically
 listen
 once
 it
 comes


from
 them.


>> How
 how
 serious
 is
 he
 H Heath
 on
 the


drone
 push?
 I
 mean
 I
 know
 publicly
 he


said
 we
 are
 really
 getting
 ready
 to


support
 this
 industry
 but
 are
 they
 so


disturbed
 by
 the
 geopolitical


instability
 with
 Russia,
 Ukraine,


Israel,
 Hamas
 that
 they're
 just
 like


this
 is
 the
 future
 and
 we
 this


administration
 has
 to
 be
 prepared
 for


the
 next
 5
 years.
 I
 I
 think
 they're


absolutely
 serious
 about
 getting
 drones


to
 every
 soldier.
 uh
 every
 like
 I
 was


flying
 with
 101st
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago
 and


what
 they're
 hearing
 uh
 from
 Hegathth
 uh


is
 get
 get
 everybody
 a
 drone
 and
 what


we're
 seeing
 to
 start
 with
 some
 of
 the


uh
 you
 know
 once
 the
 um
 the
 world
 opens


back
 up
 but
 we're
 uh
 we're
 also
 seeing


some
 some
 contract
 flows
 change


dramatically
 from
 original
 uh
 you
 know


what
 the
 size
 of
 these
 contracts
 were


supposed
 to
 be
 compared
 to
 what
 they're


probably
 going
 to
 be
 going
 forward
 has


accelerated
 uh
 quite
 quite
 a
 bit
 from


previous
 numbers
 from
 the
 previous


administration.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 it's
 at
 least
 publicly
 what


I've
 seen
 is
 that
 the
 admin
 really
 cares


about
 drone
 technology
 and
 you
 know


you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 more
 defense


contractors
 get
 a
 lot
 more
 love
 uh
 from


the
 administration
 because
 they
 want
 to


be
 more
 prepared
 and
 and
 it
 and
 it
 makes


sense
 over
 the
 long
 term.
 Uh
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 other
 drone
 platform
 companies


like
 Andos
 and
 a
 bunch
 of
 more
 that
 I


could
 name.
 How
 would
 you
 say
 you


differentiate
 from
 those
 companies
 that


are
 also
 out
 there
 competing
 for
 some
 of


the
 same
 contracts
 potentially?


>> Yeah,
 so
 we
 we
 started
 with
 um
 a
 a


program
 of
 record
 called
 short-range


reconnaissance
 which
 was
 almost
 5
 years


ago
 before
 we
 got
 into
 the
 final
 down


selection.
 So
 um
 we
 you
 know
 we
 we


pivoted
 to
 defense
 many
 many
 years
 ago


um
 and
 we
 focused
 on
 the
 war
 fighter
 as


the
 customer
 and
 nobody
 else.
 So
 our
 our


our
 requirements
 for
 our
 drones
 were,


hey,
 this
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 for
 the


the
 war
 fighter,
 the
 army
 requirements


are
 very
 strict
 in
 what
 they
 want
 to


make
 a
 soldier
 safe
 and
 more
 lethal.
 We


built
 a
 drone
 for
 that.
 We
 didn't
 kind


of
 say,
 "Hey,
 we
 got
 this
 cool
 thing.
 Uh


it's
 a
 it's
 for
 first
 responders
 and


fire
 departments
 and
 shoehorn
 it
 into
 a


army
 or
 or
 a
 warf
 fighters,
 you
 know,


rucks
 sack."
 No,
 no.
 We
 built
 it
 for


that
 rucks
 sack
 so
 they
 can
 be
 safer
 and


more
 lethal.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 other


companies
 are
 are
 pretty
 broad
 and


they're
 investing
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 different


things,
 different
 strategies.
 I'm
 sure


Andos
 is
 going
 to
 do
 great.
 They've
 got


a
 quite
 a
 war
 chess
 right
 now
 and
 uh
 you


know
 Eric's
 a
 smart
 guy.
 Uh
 so
 I
 I
 think


uh
 I
 think
 they'll
 do
 well
 and
 they're


they've
 been
 pretty
 aggressive
 uh
 in
 the


last
 couple
 weeks
 with
 the
 acquisition.


So
 I
 think
 uh
 he's
 going
 to
 put
 that


money
 to
 work
 right
 away.


Uh,
 all right.
 Last
 couple
 questions
 for


you.
 Andre,
 any
 thoughts
 on
 them
 as
 a


broader
 defense
 contractor
 that's


growing.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 uh
 they're
 great.


>> I
 think
 is
 interested
 in
 drones
 as
 well,


right?
 I
 mean,


>> yeah,
 they
 we
 don't
 overlap
 uh
 other


than
 uh
 we're
 supposed
 to
 be
 integrating


with
 the
 MR
 teams.
 So
 Anderil
 Ghost,


like
 the
 helicopter
 that
 they
 have,
 and


uh
 another
 company,
 uh
 PDW
 got
 the
 the


down
 select
 for
 Trunch
 One,
 which


they're
 still
 in
 the
 middle
 of.
 So
 it's


not
 in
 production
 yet.
 It's
 not
 a


production
 contract,
 but
 uh
 long
 range


reconnaissance,
 mid-range


reconnaissance,
 and
 short-range


reconnaissance
 are
 all
 under
 one
 group.


It's
 called
 PMUAS.


And
 u
 and
 that
 all
 comes
 out
 of
 one


light
 item
 in
 the
 budget
 called
 SUAS.


And
 uh


>> we're
 supposed
 to
 integrate
 across
 all


these
 platforms.
 Uh
 we've
 got
 the
 first


universal
 controller
 that
 the
 Army
 uh


has
 up
 and
 running
 using
 our
 controller.


So
 we're
 supposed
 to
 be
 integrating
 with


with
 other
 folks
 like
 Anderles
 and
 and


the
 other
 folks
 in
 MR
 and
 LR.
 And


there's
 also
 SPS,
 which
 Fleer
 one
 with


that
 little
 black
 hornet.
 Um
 that
 is
 uh


the
 Sensorborn
 uh
 systems
 from
 Fleer.


Great
 drone.
 Um
 and
 obviously
 we
 work
 a


lot
 with
 Fleer
 with
 their
 cameras
 and


their
 sensors.
 So,
 uh,
 we
 kind
 of
 work


with
 everybody.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 also
 what
 I
 got


from
 the
 conversation
 we
 had
 at
 APCON
 a


couple
 months
 ago
 is
 like
 becoming
 that


de
 facto
 platform
 to
 work
 with
 as
 many


integrated
 systems
 as
 possible.
 when


when
 you're
 getting
 messages
 from
 the


government
 to
 integrate
 one
 platform


onto
 another,
 it
 seems
 like
 they
 really


want
 to
 make
 it
 interoperable,
 which
 is


which


>> no
 that
 that
 that
 is
 absolutely
 true


because
 this
 is,
 believe
 it
 or
 not,
 uh


even
 though
 this
 number
 is
 probably
 very


dated
 now
 from
 what
 we're
 hearing
 in
 the


last
 few
 months,
 the
 original
 program


for
 SR
 was
 about
 14,000
 aircrafts,
 which


could
 be
 the
 largest
 amount
 of
 aircraft


ever
 acquired.
 They
 don't
 cost
 hundreds


of
 millions
 of
 dollars
 each.
 not
 the


largest
 in
 in
 revenue
 in
 revenue
 or
 in


dollars
 on
 contract
 value
 but
 in
 the


amount
 of
 aircraft.
 So
 the
 amount
 of


sensors
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 have


implemented
 into
 the
 army
 is
 more
 than


any
 other
 program
 before.
 So
 you
 know


you
 know
 Palanteer
 is
 going
 to
 have


access
 to
 all
 these
 sensors
 for
 visual


navigation.
 Great
 amount
 of
 information


uh
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 across
 way
 more


devices
 than
 any
 other
 previous
 program.


So,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 quite
 a


data
 offering
 uh
 being
 on
 our
 platform,


which
 is
 currently
 the
 largest
 aircraft


acquisition.


We
 got
 a
 super
 chat
 right
 here
 from
 Math


97.
 Uh
 been
 an
 Arcad
 investor
 since
 last


year.
 I
 love
 the
 company.
 Random


question.
 Do
 you
 think
 drones
 or
 evol


could
 ever
 replace
 the
 need
 for
 layover


flights
 by
 transporting
 people
 up
 to


planes
 in
 flight?


>> Wow,
 that's
 that
 that's
 uh
 interesting.


But
 uh
 I
 I've
 been
 looking
 at
 a
 a
 cargo


drone
 recently
 and
 they
 let
 me
 fly
 it.


It
 can
 handle
 500
 lb
 and
 what
 they
 had


inside
 of
 it
 was
 a
 dummy
 army
 soldier.


Um
 and
 my
 first
 my
 first
 joke
 was,
 "Hey,


you
 guys
 mind
 if
 I
 could
 get
 in
 this


thing
 and
 fly
 around?"
 And
 they
 said,


"Yeah,
 we'd
 lose
 every
 license
 that
 we


have."
 Um
 so
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 it
 could
 be


possible.
 I
 don't
 know if
 anybody
 would


want
 to
 try
 it
 or
 do
 it
 as
 a
 way
 to


catch
 a
 flight.


Yeah,
 it
 would
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 the


Jetsons.
 That's
 correct.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 the
 overall
 drone
 industry,
 I
 mean,


is
 this
 something
 to
 you
 that's
 in
 the


tens
 of
 billions,
 hundreds
 of
 billions,


trillions?
 Like
 realistically,
 how
 big


do
 you
 think
 the
 TAM
 is
 for
 this
 market?


>> It's
 definitely
 even
 right
 now
 it's


already
 in
 the
 close
 to
 like
 50
 billion


world
 right
 now.
 Um
 and
 that's
 uh
 you


know,
 and
 we're
 only
 nine
 months
 into


administration
 saying,
 "Holy
 cow,
 we're


behind.
 Let's
 move
 forward."
 Uh
 and
 and


lots
 of
 times
 like
 you
 know
 DARPA
 and


the
 internet
 and
 all
 these
 things
 get


started
 with
 the
 government
 first.
 GPS's


we
 wouldn't
 have
 cheap
 GPS's
 if
 it


wasn't
 for
 the
 government.


>> So
 and
 I
 hate
 to
 I
 hate
 to
 say
 the


government's
 the
 way
 to
 go
 to
 get


certain
 things
 done.
 Um
 but
 the
 uh


without
 that
 we
 wouldn't
 have
 we


wouldn't
 get
 there.
 And
 I
 think
 long


term
 with
 the
 scale
 of
 what
 the
 uh


Department
 of
 War
 is
 doing,
 we
 will
 be


doing
 so
 much
 stuff
 for
 security.
 Um
 you


know,
 we
 already
 have
 drone
 swarms
 at


Redcat
 uh
 you
 know,
 on
 our
 on
 our
 boats,


the
 USVs.
 We're
 going
 to
 be
 putting


swarms
 in
 the
 front
 of
 them
 uh
 along


with
 missiles
 and
 torpedoes.
 Um,
 but


having
 swarms
 that
 can
 reliably
 get
 up


in
 the
 air
 by
 themselves
 and
 monitor


areas
 for
 ISR,


that
 would
 be
 very
 valuable
 to
 think


about
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 locations
 that
 the


security
 guards
 are
 walking
 around
 and


falling
 asleep
 during
 the
 night
 and


where
 you
 could
 have
 literally
 live


sensors
 flying
 24/7
 along
 the
 border
 of


a
 very
 important
 facility.
 That
 would
 be


way
 better
 than
 uh
 humans.
 Uh,
 and
 I


think
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 way
 more


applications
 like
 that
 come
 down
 into


the
 consumer
 market
 as
 we
 get
 some
 scale


because
 of
 the
 departments
 of
 war
 and


the
 thirst
 for
 small
 smart
 weapons.


>> Yeah,
 agree.
 It
 does
 seem
 like
 that


market
 is
 not
 slowing
 down.

Jeff,
 thanks

 Last


question
 for
 you.
 We
 got
 to
 ask
 this


question
 to
 everyone
 who
 joins
 the


stream
 and
 you're
 welcome
 back
 anytime


you'd
 want
 to
 be
 on.
 Uh,
 what's
 your


favorite
 movie?


>> Oh,
 I'm
 going
 to
 embarrass
 myself.
 It's


kind
 of
 a
 family
 joke,
 but
 it's


Tallaladega
 Nights.


>> It's
 a
 great
 movie.


It's
 a
 great
 movie.
 I
 haven't
 watched


that
 movie,
 but
 I'm
 believing
 it's
 a


great
 movie.
 Oh,
 no
 sir.
 My
 just
 my
 wife


on
 my
 50th
 birthday
 replicated
 with
 all


my
 kids
 the
 baby
 Jesus
 scene
 which


you're
 not
 going
 to
 know
 cuz
 you
 haven't


seen
 it
 yet,
 but
 if
 you
 ever
 uh
 she
 she


went
 and
 got
 all
 the
 Sunbeam
 bread
 and


the
 Kentucky
 Fried
 Chicken
 and
 the
 Power


Eight
 and
 they
 made
 completely
 made
 a


joke
 on
 my
 50th
 birthday
 and
 it
 was
 one


of the
 best
 birthdays
 I
 had.
 But
 uh
 it's


just
 a
 it's
 a
 goofy
 movie
 but
 so
 much


fun.


>> So
 this
 is
 like
 legit
 like
 last
 movie


you
 could
 watch
 it
 would
 be
 Tallaladega


Nights.
 Yeah,
 if
 I
 wanted
 to
 laugh.


>> All
 right,
 there
 you
 go.
 I
 love
 it.


Thank
 you,
 Jeff.
 I
 appreciate
 it.
 Jeff's


Twitter
 in
 the
 chat
 and
 uh
 we'll
 hope
 to


have
 you

 Thanks,

 Appreciate
 it.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Later.


All
 right,
 there
 you
 go.

 Uh,


I
 I
 I
 don't
 know what
 you
 I


Dude,
 as
 soon
 as
 you
 said
 it,
 I
 was


like,
 "This
 from
 like
 1935?"
 Like,
 what?


What?
 I've
 never
 heard
 of
 this,
 but
 I


couldn't
 lie.
 I
 couldn't
 lie
 and
 say
 I


watched
 it,
 so
 I
 had
 to
 have
 to
 be


honest
 today.

 so
 it's
 been
 around
 for
 a

Well,
 there
 you
 go.

 That's

And
 again,
 shout
 out
 to
 Jeff.
 Awesome


guy.
 And
 uh
 you
 know,
 when
 I
 talked
 to


him
 back
 at
 AICON
 in
 March,
 he
 uh
 he


really
 helped
 me
 understand
 the
 drone


industry.
 And
 you
 know,
 we've
 seen
 a
 lot


of
 these
 drone
 stocks
 start
 to
 get


momentum.
 and
 they
 have a
 mandate
 from


the
 government.
 So
 maybe
 that
 momentum


continues.

Dude,
 I
 should
 have
 lied
 and
 said
 I


watched
 it,
 bro.
 I
 should
 have
 lied.
 I


should
 have
 lied.
 But
 I
 I'm
 choosing
 to


be
 honest
 because
 you
 guys
 got
 all
 mad


at
 me
 when
 I
 when
 I
 said
 I
 watched


Animal
 House.


See
 how
 much
 more
 less
 awkward
 it


becomes
 if
 you
 just
 be
 like,
 "Great


movie.
 Awesome.
 That's
 a
 classic."


Instead,
 the
 other
 person
 has
 to
 be


like, "Well,
 I
 know
 you
 didn't
 watch
 it,


but
 there's
 this
 funny
 scene."
 It's


like,
 we
 could
 avoid
 all
 of
 that
 by
 just


going
 with
 the
 flow.


Just
 going
 with
 the
 flow.


But
 you
 guys
 got
 mad
 last
 time
 I
 did
 it.


Google
 two,
 dude.
 272.
 This
 thing
 just


jumped
 right
 when
 freaking
 uh
 right
 when


freaking
 Jeff
 came
 on.
 I
 I
 don't
 know


why
 Google's
 moving
 up
 and
 Microsoft's


moving
 down.


But
 I
 wonder
 what
 that
 means
 for


earnings


if
 Microsoft
 and
 Google
 have
 good


numbers,
 but
 maybe
 one
 is
 running
 up
 too


much
 already
 and
 the
 other
 one
 is


running
 down.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to


see.
 We're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see.
 Uh
 all


right.
 So,
 uh
 I
 will
 be
 back.
 Uh,
 first


of
 all,
 if
 anyone
 has
 any
 lunch,
 I
 think


you
 should
 go
 get
 some
 lunch
 right
 now.


I'll
 be
 back
 in
 a
 second.
 I
 do
 have
 to


use
 the
 bathroom.
 It's
 been
 like
 four


hours
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 heat
 up
 a
 little


bit
 of
 chicken
 and
 rice
 that
 I
 have
 from


yesterday.
 So,
 we'll
 heat
 that
 up.
 So,


we're
 going
 to
 be
 here
 all
 day.
 Keep
 it


moving.
 I'll
 be
 back
 in
 like


5
 10
 minutes.
 Probably
 five
 minutes.


Shouldn't
 take
 too
 long.
 And
 uh
 if


anyone
 else
 has
 lunch,
 go
 get
 some


lunch.
 We'll
 be
 back.
 And
 then
 we
 got
 JP


in
 a
 couple
 hours.


Got
 JPEG
 in
 a
 couple
 hours.


We're
 gonna
 see
 what
 we
 got.
 Use
 the

 There's
 a

on

I've
 never
 seen
 a

 I
 was
 I


was
 just
 going
 to
 play
 CNBC,
 but
 I


didn't
 know
 there
 was
 a
 break
 feature.


All right,
 I'll
 be
 back
 in
 like
 five


minutes.
 We
 got
 uh
 we
 got

Let's
 see
 what
 she
 has
 to
 say
 and
 then


we'll
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.

look
 at

 You
 want
 to
 Liz


take
 issue,
 agree
 with
 or
 whatever
 with


any
 of
 the
 comments
 that
 were
 already


made
 on
 the
 desk.


>> Um
 I
 mean
 I'll
 take
 a
 little
 issue
 with


the
 the
 perplexing
 comment
 because
 we've


been
 good.
 I
 did
 too.
 So
 I'm
 glad
 you


did.
 Thanks
 for
 the
 backup.
 Go
 ahead.


>> We're
 so
 and
 on
 his

 too,
 right?


>> Joey
 on
 his
 birthday.


>> Happy
 birthday.


>> Happy
 birthday
 Joe.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Let's
 continue


please.
 So,
 so
 we've
 been
 talking
 about


this
 for
 a
 long
 time
 that
 there
 would
 be


a
 chase
 into
 year
 end
 and
 here
 we
 are


one
 month
 into
 Q4
 and
 the
 chase
 is
 on.


The
 large
 cap
 love
 affair
 is
 on.
 The


risk
 on
 speculation
 trade
 is
 alive
 and


well.
 The
 game
 is
 strong,
 right?
 And


this
 is
 happening
 during
 a
 week
 when
 Q4


seasonality
 usually
 picks
 up
 and
 then
 we


have
 this
 run
 into
 year
 end.
 So
 that


supports
 this
 even
 further.
 And
 then


this
 is
 also
 characteristic
 of
 late


cycle
 large
 cap
 behavior.
 Usually
 when


you
 have
 number
 one
 late
 late
 economic


cycle,
 late
 cycle
 in
 a
 rally,
 you
 also


have
 concentration
 that
 just
 gets
 more


and
 more
 concentrated
 until
 it
 turns
 the


other
 way.
 There's
 no
 timing
 that
 that


could
 go
 on
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 But
 all
 of


this
 is
 emblematic
 of
 that
 same
 trend.


>> Really?
 I
 mean,
 I've
 been
 hearing
 this
 a


lot
 over
 the
 last
 year
 or
 so,
 if
 not


longer.
 Are
 we
 really
 that
 late
 cycle?


How
 could
 we
 be
 late
 cycle
 if
 people
 say


we're
 in
 like
 the
 second
 inning
 of
 the


whole
 AI
 spend
 and
 the
 AI
 boom?
 That


doesn't
 match
 up
 in
 my
 mind.


>> Somebody's
 wrong.
 We
 don't
 know
 who
 yet.


So
 late
 cycle
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 the
 market


cycle.
 There's
 a
 business
 cycle
 and


there's
 a
 market
 cycle.
 Right
 now
 we
 are


a
 little
 bit
 convoluted
 on
 where
 we
 are


in
 the
 economy.
 Number
 one,
 we
 don't


have
 a
 lot
 of
 data,
 but
 we're
 coming


down
 in
 inflation,
 which
 is
 not
 usually


late
 cycle
 behavior.
 If
 we
 get
 into


2026,
 it's
 possible
 that
 we
 have


stimulus
 that
 comes
 into
 effect
 that


actually
 drives
 inflation
 back
 up
 a


little
 bit.
 We
 never
 actually
 hit


target.
 We
 start
 rising
 again
 and


inflation.
 Unemployment
 starts
 to
 rise.


That
 starts
 to
 feel
 more
 late
 cycle
 in


the
 economic
 standpoint.


>> But
 I
 mean,
 we're
 cutting
 rates.
 I
 think


the
 market's
 late
 cycle.
 We're
 cutting


We're
 cutting
 rates.
 Well,
 if
 we
 have
 to


pause
 that,
 right?
 There's
 all
 of
 these


question
 marks
 that
 could
 happen
 in


2026.
 That's
 not
 a
 2025
 story,


>> but
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 seems
 a
 lot
 of


if
 if
 this
 happens,
 if
 that
 happens,
 but


what's
 the
 likelihood?


>> We
 play
 probabilities
 too
 more
 so
 than


ifs,
 right?


>> Isn't
 that
 what
 you
 all
 do?


>> Can
 I
 just
 make
 one
 comment
 on


information?


>> 2000,
 March
 of
 2000
 was
 when
 the
 market


crashed,
 right?
 And
 the
 S&P
 was
 down


50%,
 the
 Nasdaq
 was
 down
 90%
 at
 the


worst.
 And
 it
 was
 the
 beginning
 of
 the


internet,
 right?
 It
 was
 the
 beginning
 of


the
 internet,
 but
 it
 was
 also
 the
 end
 of


this
 enormous
 rise,
 the
 euphoria
 about


internet
 stocks
 that
 did
 come
 down


crashing.
 So
 they
 don't
 have
 to
 coincide


the
 cycle
 on
 the
 market,


>> right?
 They're
 not
 supposed
 to
 coincide.


But
 right
 now,
 I
 think
 we
 are
 at
 a
 point


where
 actually
 the
 market
 is
 very


detached
 from
 what
 the
 economy
 is
 doing.


That
 doesn't
 make
 the
 market
 wrong.
 The


market
 is
 always
 using
 the
 information


it
 has
 and
 the
 optimism
 that
 we're


looking
 at
 with
 AI.
 Do
 you
 think
 the


market's
 detached
 from
 what
 the
 economy


is
 doing?
 The
 economy
 is
 pretty
 good.


>> Pretty
 good,
 but
 it's
 not
 heating
 up.


It's
 cooling
 down.
 So,
 if
 the
 market
 is


is
 with
 the
 economy,
 the
 market
 should


be
 front
 running
 maybe
 a
 heating
 up
 in


economic
 activity.
 But
 we
 know
 that
 a


lot
 of
 the
 metrics
 are
 showing
 us
 that


economic
 activity
 is
 actually
 cooling


down,
 which
 we
 needed
 to
 happen
 in
 order


to
 bring
 inflation
 down.
 And
 now
 we're


getting
 announcements
 that
 are
 getting


slightly
 concerning
 layoff
 announcements


from
 a
 lot
 of
 bellweather
 companies,
 but


we
 don't
 have
 any
 labor
 data.
 So
 right


now
 we
 can
 still
 say
 that
 the
 economy
 is


okay
 and
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 okay


because
 we
 don't
 have
 any
 data
 that


proves
 otherwise.
 But
 when
 it
 starts


coming
 back
 out
 again,
 we
 don't
 know


what
 that'll
 look
 like
 yet.
 You
 know,


it's
 so
 interesting
 because
 when
 you


talk
 to
 uh
 to
 companies
 uh
 and
 whether


it's
 CEO
 or
 CFO
 or
 just
 pick
 somebody,


you
 know,
 that's
 in
 middle
 management,


um
 there's
 a
 disconnect
 because
 they


don't
 see
 things
 being
 as
 good
 in
 the


economy.
 Yet,
 we
 see
 numbers,
 we
 see


some
 companies
 reporting,
 but
 and
 and


I've
 been
 unable
 to
 square
 that


disconnect.
 It's
 been
 going
 on
 for


months
 and
 months
 that
 the
 economy
 is


not
 that
 good.
 We
 hear
 from
 some
 people


that
 come
 on
 the
 network
 as
 well,
 but
 it


really
 doesn't
 matter
 in
 terms
 of
 the


market.
 Market's
 looking
 forward
 and


what
 it
 sees
 forward
 is
 lower
 rates,
 low


regulations,
 you're
 not
 levered
 to
 AI.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 through
 economy.


>> The
 economy
 doesn't
 look
 good
 to
 you


>> because
 if
 you
 go
 down
 the
 list,
 I
 love


that
 that
 uh
 Carl
 uh
 Kintia
 put
 this
 out


on
 social
 from
 vital
 knowledge.
 It
 tells


a
 good
 story
 about
 if
 you're
 tech,
 boom.


>> If
 you're
 not
 tech,
 not
 so
 much.

I
 can
 look
 at
 all
 of
 those
 and
 there
 are


probably
 more
 and
 build
 a
 case
 that
 you


see


>> told
 you

 is
 not
 so
 good


>> and
 I
 agree


>> or
 we
 have a
 new
 economy
 that
 the
 market


and
 investors
 are
 placing
 their
 bets
 on


>> right
 so
 it
 comes
 full
 circle
 to
 what


you
 started
 the
 show
 with
 which
 is
 that


the
 breath
 disparity
 so
 that's
 more


reflective
 the
 breath
 is
 more
 reflective


of
 what
 I
 believe
 is
 actually
 going
 on


in
 the
 underlying
 economy
 and
 the


question
 is
 how
 do
 you
 play
 that
 and
 the


only
 way
 to
 play
 it
 with
 confidence,
 I


believe,
 is
 staying
 with
 the
 AI


companies.
 Now,
 they're
 overvalued
 on


any
 reasonable
 metric,
 right?
 But
 where


else
 are
 you
 going
 to
 go?
 Okay,
 I
 love


the
 All
 right,
 we
 are
 back.
 We
 are
 back.


Does
 everyone
 have
 some
 lunch?


Got
 some
 chicken,
 some
 rice.
 Dude,
 I


think
 the
 last
 time
 I
 ate
 on
 stream,
 it


was
 like
 a
 year
 ago
 and
 it
 was
 like
 I


don't
 know
 why
 it
 was
 I
 was
 live
 at


night
 and
 I
 think
 I
 ate
 sushi
 on
 stream.


So,
 can
 you
 guys
 see
 the
 smoke?
 It's


like
 heating
 up.


We
 are
 uh
 officially


officially
 eating
 lunch
 together.
 Look


at
 that.
 Look
 at
 that.
 One
 meal
 a
 day.


Let's
 get
 some
 broccoli.
 Let's
 get
 some


broccoli
 in
 it.


It's
 like
 5,000
 people
 watching.
 You


chew
 a

 Dude,
 Dumb


Money
 is
 live
 right
 now.
 Should
 we
 watch


Dumb

Google's
 still

 down.


All right,
 let's
 let's
 go
 to
 dumb
 money


for
 a
 little
 bit.
 Let's
 see
 what
 these


guys
 are
 saying.
 Is
 anyone
 else
 eating


lunch?
 Put
 in
 the
 chat.
 First
 of
 all,


what
 time
 is
 it
 where
 you're
 at?
 I
 mean,


it's
 12
 on
 the
 Well,
 it's
 9
 in


California.


It's
 12
 in
 the
 Northeast.
 It's
 like
 six


in
 the
 UK,
 right?


So,
 yes,
 dumb
 money.
 All right,
 let's


see
 what
 they're
 saying.
 the
 sector
 and


certainly
 it
 looks
 like
 they
 are
 uh
 they


continue
 to
 raise
 in
 a
 bit
 and
 open
 AI


which
 is
 multiple
 old
 episodes
 right


that
 one
 worked
 out
 uh
 in
 a
 way
 uh


Amazon
 might
 be
 the
 way
 to
 play


anthropic
 on
 on
 the
 AI
 side
 now
 it
 just


took
 a
 while
 for
 them
 to
 get
 there
 with


the
 data
 center
 capacity
 to
 serve
 that


relationship
 and
 this
 could
 be
 the


quarter
 where
 that
 becomes
 the
 the
 topic


of
 focus
 this
 I
 mean


>> perhaps
 I
 mean
 we've
 been
 talking
 about


how
 you
 know
 your
 favorite
 chat
 GBT
 is


the
 normie
 of
 uh
 all
 LLMs
 and
 that


people
 that
 are
 doing
 serious
 work
 are


doing
 it
 on
 different
 models


for
 a
 while
 that
 was
 Gemini
 but
 I
 hear


more
 and
 more
 people
 um
 seeing
 praises


for
 Claude
 so
 um


you
 know
 maybe
 dump
 some
 people
 are


dumping
 uh
 Gemini
 for
 Claude
 and
 I
 think


we've
 seen
 that
 there's
 what
 there's


rumors
 is
 that
 their
 ARR
 has
 grown
 like


7x
 in
 the
 past
 year
 or
 something
 like


that.
 So
 I
 I
 do
 think
 people
 are


converting
 and
 and
 starting
 to
 utilize


cloud.


>> All right,
 we'll
 get
 back
 to
 them
 later.


But
 I
 mean
 they're
 speaking
 of
 Google's


ARR
 right
 there
 that's
 not
 slowing
 down,


especially
 in
 the
 cloud
 space.

 again,
 Nvidia,
 I


think
 it's
 pretty
 normal
 for
 it
 to
 go


from

However,
 that
 is
 like
 120

 in

 that
 it
 just
 lost.
 Uh
 but,


you
 know,
 then
 again,
 breaking
 above


200,


one
 would
 argue
 there's
 probably
 going


to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 pullback
 there.

 I
 tried
 doing
 that
 last


year,
 bro.
 It
 just
 didn't
 work.
 So
 now


after
 the
 market
 open,
 I
 eat
 my
 one
 meal


and
 kind
 of
 gets
 me
 through
 the
 end
 of


the
 day.


But
 if
 you
 can
 if
 you
 can
 last
 through


800
 p.m.,
 that's
 incredible
 because
 it


is
 not
 easy.
 Oh
 my
 goodness,

 we

 I'm
 eating
 some


chicken
 in
 the
 car
 that's
 so
 crazy
 every


time
 every
 time
 every
 time
 like
 like


like
 people
 say
 where
 they
 are
 what


they're
 doing
 dude
 someone
 last
 night


who's
 he's
 been
 a
 longtime
 pounder


investor
 and
 he
 he
 sent
 me
 a
 video
 of
 of


his
 family
 like
 all
 together
 sitting
 on


on
 the
 couch
 saying
 happy
 birthday
 and
 I


was
 like
 dude
 like
 like
 this
 is
 crazy


like
 you
 he
 had
 he
 had
 two
 little
 girls


his
 wife
 and
 you
 know
 their
 lives
 have


been
 completely
 changed
 from
 pounding


because
 like
 he
 went
 in
 heavy
 and
 then


they
 all
 three
 said
 happy
 birthday
 you


see
 this
 stuff
 and
 you
 want
 to
 cry
 dude


you're
 like
 this
 is
 just
 this
 is


absolutely
 crazy
 but
 it
 is
 it
 is
 the


point
 of
 a
 community
 right
 everyone
 here


comes
 together
 and
 no matter
 where
 you


are
 what
 you're
 doing


get
 to
 bond
 over
 a
 certain
 topic


Spencer
 says,
 "I'm
 watching
 from
 North


Korea."
 Of
 course
 you
 are.
 Dude,
 North


Korea
 is
 scary.
 I
 had
 my
 North
 Korea


binge
 back
 in
 freaking
 uh
 back
 in
 May.
 I


was
 like,
 you
 know,
 you
 have
 these


rabbit
 holes
 you
 go
 down.
 I
 went
 down


the
 rabbit
 hole
 in
 North
 Korea
 and
 I


learned
 a
 lot
 about
 them
 and
 I
 was
 like,


my
 goodness,
 like
 they
 are
 not
 a


friendly
 place.


They
 are
 not
 a
 friendly
 place.
 Like
 it's


not
 nice
 to
 be
 in
 North
 Korea.
 all
 these


vloggers
 that
 go
 to
 North
 Korea
 to
 like


show
 off
 and
 like
 I'm
 like,
 "Bro,
 I


would
 be
 so
 scared
 to
 say
 anything."


What's
 the
 name
 of
 the
 guy
 that
 that


that
 they
 basically
 killed,
 but
 they


didn't
 fully
 kill
 him,
 but
 they
 beat
 him


up
 enough
 to
 kill
 him?
 It's
 the
 white


guy
 who
 was
 there
 and
 unfortunately
 he


he
 like
 he
 took
 something
 off
 the
 hotel


wall
 and
 the
 cameras
 caught
 him
 and
 then


they
 just
 brutally
 tortured
 him
 and
 then


they
 sent
 him
 back
 to
 the
 US
 basically


dead.


Otto
 Lambir,
 is
 that
 the
 guy's
 name?


That
 story
 is
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 rabbit
 hole
 to


go
 down.
 Yeah,
 Otto
 Lambir


from
 North
 Korea.


Yeah,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 seen
 those


that
 that
 documentary.
 Then
 you
 got


Dennis
 Robin
 who
 freaking
 loves
 North


Korea
 because
 he
 thinks
 Kim
 Jong-un
 is


like
 his
 best
 friend.


So


there's
 a
 variety
 of
 different


circumstances
 on
 it.
 We're
 getting
 a


bunch
 of
 downtime,
 guys.
 Uh
 down
 outages


are
 spiking.
 Microsoft,
 Minecraft,
 AWS,


Starbucks,
 Xbox,
 and
 Kroger.
 All
 their


websites


are
 reporting
 reporting
 a


a
 uh
 a
 down
 detector
 increase.
 Wow,


dude.
 16,000
 reports
 from
 Microsoft


Azure.
 What
 about
 AWS?


2,000
 reports.
 So,
 a
 lot
 better
 for
 AWS.


And
 then
 Xbox,
 1,800
 reports
 for
 for


Xbox
 in
 the
 Northeast.


That's
 not
 good
 before
 earnings.
 Not


good
 to
 see
 that
 before
 earnings


because
 people
 are
 getting
 fired.
 Dude,


I
 was
 I
 really
 went
 down
 the
 rabbit
 hole


last
 night
 and
 I
 saw
 all
 these
 videos
 of


people
 getting
 laid
 off
 and


it's
 tough,
 dude.
 You
 like,
 you
 know,


it's
 just
 you
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 that


as
 a
 human
 being
 and
 you
 got
 all
 these


people
 just
 thinking
 like
 they
 have
 to


figure
 out
 a
 new
 life.
 They
 have
 to


figure
 out
 what
 they're
 going
 to
 do.
 I
 I


think
 Amazon's
 giving
 90-day
 severance


then
 that's
 it.
 UNH
 website
 is
 down.


Uh
 okay.
 So
 this
 might
 be
 affecting
 a


bunch
 of
 companies
 right
 now.


United
 Health
 likely
 runs
 on
 Azure
 or


Amazon.


Yeah.
 UHC.com
 not
 working.
 Wow.
 Okay.
 So


it
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 it's
 as
 bad
 as


it
 was.
 This
 is
 UHC.
 It's
 not
 even


loading
 back
 in
 back
 last
 week
 when
 like


Robin
 at
 Coinbase
 Slack
 was
 not
 working


either.
 I
 mean,
 Legend
 so
 far
 is
 fine,


but
 you
 are
 getting
 some
 outages


across
 the
 board.
 Hood
 is
 not
 glitching


yet.
 I
 don't
 see
 it.


Jeff's
 ex
 handle
 I'm
 putting
 right
 here


in
 the
 chat
 for
 those
 that
 want
 to


follow
 him.


But


you
 are
 still
 getting
 some
 some
 hits


here
 on
 different
 websites.
 I
 don't
 own


Redcat.
 I
 don't
 own
 any
 of
 the
 drains


drone
 stocks.
 Again,
 I
 really
 just


haven't
 done
 work
 on
 them.
 Uh
 but
 I
 do


not
 own
 Redcap


or
 the
 other
 ones,
 but
 they've
 done


well.


Yeah,
 the
 layoff
 thing
 is
 I
 mean
 again


it's
 like
 it
 is


it
 is
 it
 is
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where


again
 14,000
 of
 them
 were
 sent
 out


yesterday.


So
 when
 you
 have
 14,000


a
 lot
 of
 those
 people


you
 know,
 making
 the
 argument
 that


they
 got
 hit
 from
 these
 layoffs.
 And
 you


had
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 vlogged
 the


journey
 right
 before
 they
 got
 laid
 off.


So,
 they
 got
 the
 email
 and
 they
 were


like,
 "I
 don't
 know
 if
 I'm
 officially


laid
 off."
 But


they
 might
 be
 like,
 "Here's
 this
 one


video.
 Let
 me
 show
 you
 guys
 this
 video."


This
 one
 also


is
 another
 one
 of
 people
 doing


or
 talking
 about
 these
 layoffs.


There
 is
 no
 AK
 media
 layoffs.
 This
 is
 a


very
 capital-like
 business
 when
 it
 comes


to


headcount.


Although
 we
 we
 did
 we
 ended
 up
 hiring


someone
 last
 week.
 So,
 but
 like
 again


like
 if
 if
 you're
 a
 soloreneur


entrepreneur,
 it's
 a
 little
 bit


different.
 If
 you're
 working
 at
 a
 big


company,
 you
 know,
 but
 layoffs
 again,


they
 affect
 the
 entire
 economy.
 So,
 it's


like
 it's
 not
 something
 that
 anyone
 can


really
 ignore.


All
 right,
 here
 is
 one
 of
 the
 other


videos
 yesterday.
 I'm


>> just
 laid
 off
 30,000
 peeps
 today
 and
 I'm


one
 of
 them.
 All
 QA
 in
 my
 or
 got
 laid


off
 today.
 Rule
 elimination.
 Let
 me
 walk


you
 through
 what
 happened.
 Maybe
 it


helps
 someone
 going
 through
 the
 same


thing.
 So,
 here's
 the
 timeline.
 Amazon


sent
 the
 layoff
 text
 and
 email
 at
 3:00


a.m.
 When
 I
 woke
 up
 around
 8:30,
 I
 saw


it.
 The
 email
 had
 everything.
 your


package
 thoughts,
 how
 to
 return
 to
 your


laptop,
 how
 to
 talk
 to
 HR
 all
 of
 it.


Then
 I
 saw
 Chime
 from
 my
 skip
 manager.


My
 meeting
 was
 at
 11:00
 a.m.
 We
 talked


for
 maybe
 20
 minutes.
 He
 said
 it
 was
 a


final
 decision
 made
 by
 ARC.
 Nothing
 to


negotiate.
 He
 wished
 me
 the
 best.
 It


feel
 so
 real.
 Here's
 what
 the
 package


looks
 like
 for
 everyone
 who
 is


wondering.
 90
 days
 pay
 to
 find
 a
 new


job.
 the
 seven
 weeks
 of
 pay
 plus
 all


unused
 paytime
 off.
 My
 final
 date
 is


January
 26,
 26.
 So
 basically
 about
 20


half
 months
 of
 salary
 after
 that.
 My


role
 is
 L5
 engineer
 and
 honestly
 there


aren't
 many
 opening
 left.
 Two
 in


Seattle,
 a
 couple
 more
 across
 the
 US.
 I


can't


>> So
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of these
 engineers


saying
 we
 saw
 the
 layoffs
 coming.


there's
 not
 that
 many
 other
 options
 left


because
 they're
 not
 hiring
 as
 much.
 And


then
 you
 had
 this
 guy
 who
 had
 bit
 of
 a


more
 optimistic
 take
 because
 he
 didn't


even
 want
 to
 be
 at
 Amazon
 anymore.
 But


here's
 what
 he
 said
 yesterday
 about
 this


30,000


people.
 I'm
 Amazon
 engineer.
 I
 could
 be


next,
 but
 I
 don't
 give
 a
 [ __ ]
 Here's


why.
 Every
 single
 day,
 I
 feel
 like
 I


wasn't
 working
 for
 growth.
 I
 was
 walking


away
 from
 getting
 fired.
 Just
 trying
 to


survive
 another
 review
 cycle.
 I
 worked


years
 to
 get
 here
 grind
 through
 college


interview
 for
 this
 to
 just
 not
 get


fired.
 [ __ ]
 it.
 In
 big
 tech,
 we
 are
 just


a
 number
 on
 a
 spreadsheet.
 Whether
 you


got
 lay
 off
 today
 or
 made
 job
 tomorrow.


So
 if
 I
 got
 that
 email
 tomorrow,
 here's


what
 I
 would
 do.
 I
 would
 move
 somewhere


cheaper,
 build
 my
 own
 distribution


channel
 directly,
 sell
 my
 skills
 or


product,
 own
 my
 own
 career.
 And


actually,
 I
 already
 made
 this
 decision


two
 months
 ago.
 I
 plan
 to
 leave
 Amazon


and
 start
 my
 own
 business
 overseas


probably
 by
 the
 end
 of
 this
 year
 because


I
 want
 to
 control
 my
 own
 future.
 The


safe
 pace
 that
 was
 golden
 edge
 privilege


a
 brief
 moment
 in
 time
 that
 era
 is
 gone


not
 coming
 back.
 So
 I'm
 building
 my
 own


past.
 No
 idea
 if
 it
 works
 but
 to
 see


what
 happened.


Definitely
 a
 more
 optimistic
 perspective


on
 what's
 going
 on.
 Uh
 I
 didn't
 know
 he


was
 going
 to
 curse
 like
 that.


I
 didn't
 know
 he
 was
 going
 to
 just
 flat


out
 curse
 that
 much.
 But
 nonetheless,
 he


doesn't
 give
 a
 you
 know
 what.
 And
 the


reason
 he
 doesn't
 care
 is
 um
 is
 because


you
 know what
 he
 what
 he
 speaks
 to
 is


this
 idea
 of
 feeling
 like
 you're
 a
 cog


in
 the
 machine
 which
 exists
 in
 every


single
 job
 right
 like
 people
 feel
 like


they're
 a
 cog
 in
 the
 machine
 and
 you


know
 there
 might
 not
 be
 as
 important
 but


with
 tech
 workers
 I
 think
 uniquely


there's
 so
 many
 of
 them
 and
 you
 know
 it


is
 more
 replaceable
 than
 not
 with
 the


advance
 of
 AI
 they
 just
 feel
 like
 even


though
 you
 have a
 good
 salary
 what
 is


the
 purpose
 of
 what
 you're
 working
 for


that
 is
 why
 and
 again
 this
 is
 the


intangible
 stuff
 that
 that
 is
 hard
 to


see
 in
 the
 valuation
 models
 This
 is
 why


Pounder
 matters.
 Karp
 really
 get
 I
 mean


I've
 spoken
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 employees
 at


Pounder.
 The
 reason
 they're
 there
 is


because
 of
 that
 mission.
 It
 really
 does


matter
 at
 Amazon.
 What's
 the
 mission?


Like
 get
 you
 to
 buy
 more
 stuff
 and
 and


adding
 to
 your
 cart.
 Like
 there's
 not


this
 like
 grand,
 you
 know,
 back
 when
 it


was
 a
 startup
 there
 was
 this
 grand


mission.
 Now
 it's
 just
 become
 a
 massive


company
 with
 millions
 of
 employees
 and


you
 don't
 feel
 that
 sense
 of
 purpose


anymore.
 And
 so
 it's
 tough
 to
 be
 able
 to


um
 to
 be
 able
 to
 be
 inspired.


So
 yeah,
 meta
 workers
 wake
 up
 every


morning
 to
 make
 AI
 slop.


Very
 fulfilling.
 Microsoft
 365
 users


can't
 access
 the
 admin
 center
 and
 face


delays
 with
 other
 services
 according
 to


Microsoft.
 Is
 this
 why
 Microsoft
 started


dumping
 a
 bit
 in
 the
 morning?
 Someone


knew
 there
 would
 be
 some
 issues.


That's
 not
 the
 best
 right
 before


earnings,
 bro.


It's
 not
 the
 best
 before
 earnings.


Okay,
 let's
 do
 this
 poll
 in
 the
 chat.
 I


don't
 think
 I've
 done
 this
 poll
 before.


Or
 maybe
 I
 have.
 It
 was
 a
 while
 ago,


though.
 Um,


let's
 do
 this.
 By
 the
 way,
 64%
 of
 you


said
 Google,
 21%
 said
 meta,
 and


Microsoft
 was
 last
 in
 terms
 of
 being
 the


most
 excited.
 Do
 you
 work
 in
 tech?
 Yes


or
 no?
 What
 does
 tech
 mean?
 Uh,


engineer,
 product
 manager,
 marketing,


sales.
 Do
 you
 have
 do
 are
 you
 employed


by
 a
 company
 that
 you
 would
 objectively,


you
 know,
 classify
 as
 a
 tech
 company?


and
 do
 you
 work
 in
 it?
 And
 then
 we'll


ask
 some
 other
 questions,
 but
 I'm


curious
 what
 the
 the
 mix
 is
 up
 here.


Okay,
 58%
 so
 far
 say
 no.
 It's
 almost


6040
 on
 working
 on
 tech.


A
 plumber
 I
 would
 not
 say
 is
 working
 in


tech.
 One
 could
 argue
 a
 plumber
 might
 be


getting
 paid
 and
 more
 of
 these
 people


that
 work
 in
 tech.


QA


uh
 engineer


data
 scientist
 Peter
 says
 I
 invest
 in


tech.


Is
 lemonade
 at
 $60?
 Is
 lemonade
 actually


at
 $60?
 Where's
 Lemonade?


Bro,
 what
 did
 Lemonade
 announce
 today?


Look
 at
 that.
 61
 7%
 move.


Okay,
 so
 I'm
 looking
 like
 or
 it's


looking
 like
 6040.


Okay,
 6040.
 All
 right.
 So
 64.
 Let's
 ask


another
 question.


Do
 you


work
 in
 a
 trade
 job?
 Trade
 job
 broadly


defined


as
 skill
 sets
 that
 you
 went
 to
 trade


school
 for
 or
 you
 use
 your
 hands,
 you


fix
 ACs,
 you
 know,
 you
 plumber,
 that


type
 of
 stuff.
 So
 I'm
 trying
 to
 see
 the


mix
 of
 how
 many
 trade
 jobs
 we
 have


versus
 how
 many
 tech
 jobs
 we
 have.


24%.


Because
 it
 definitely
 leveraged
 more


towards
 tech
 versus
 trades.


8020


on
 this.


He's
 going
 to
 ask
 for
 a
 social
 security


number
 next.
 Oh
 my
 gosh.


Okay.
 So,
 the
 last
 poll
 I
 was
 going
 to


ask
 right
 here.
 So,
 7030
 there.
 And
 this


one
 kind
 of
 culminates
 everything,
 but
 I


wanted
 to
 get
 some
 of
 the
 specifics.
 Do


you
 think
 your
 job
 is
 blue
 collar
 or


white
 collar?


Blue
 or
 white?
 What
 are
 we
 thinking?


I
 think
 you
 can
 you
 can
 objectively
 tell


yourself
 if
 it's
 blue
 or
 white,
 right?


Like


if
 you
 are
 actively
 doing
 something
 on


the
 day-to-day
 moving
 you
 know
 you're


getting
 things
 done
 here
 and
 there


traveling


uh
 you
 know
 point
 A
 to
 point
 B
 probably


more
 blue
 collar
 obviously
 factory


warehouse
 driver
 is
 blue
 collar
 if


you're
 sitting
 in
 front
 of
 a
 screen
 all


day
 yeah
 it's
 white
 collar
 you're
 not


you're
 not
 blue
 collar


I
 think
 my
 job
 is
 [ __ ]
 so
 is
 it


brown


Uh,
 okay.
 What's
 the
 mix
 on
 this?
 6040.


6040.
 6535.


So,
 here's
 the
 question,
 right?
 I
 wonder


how
 many
 of
 the
 bluecollar
 jobs
 actually


are
 going to
 be
 in
 a
 safer
 position
 than


the
 white
 collar
 jobs
 given
 what
 we're


seeing
 with
 all
 these
 layoffs.


Again,
 we
 watched
 that
 video
 this


morning
 of
 the
 girl
 who's
 in
 marketing


for
 Amazon
 ads.
 Like


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 lie,
 when
 she
 said
 I'm


a
 marketing
 manager
 for
 Amazon
 ads,
 I


have
 no
 idea
 what
 that
 is.
 I
 have
 no


clue.
 And
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 it's
 a
 you


know,
 a
 role
 that
 should
 have
 been


filled
 and
 is
 valuable
 to
 Amazon.
 But


like
 if
 you
 can't
 immediately
 say,
 you


know,
 why
 is
 that
 creating
 value
 for
 the


for
 the
 shareholder?
 Because
 I'm


thinking
 as
 a
 shareholder,
 I'm
 like,


okay,
 so
 this
 girl
 probably
 getting
 paid


150,000.
 What
 is
 she
 doing
 that's


helping,
 you
 know,
 my
 stock?
 If
 you


can't
 say
 it
 and
 if
 Jassee's
 in
 the


boardroom
 thinking,
 "All
 right,
 I
 don't


know
 why
 we
 have
 this
 person
 here."


Like,
 inevitably
 that's
 gone.
 And
 until


the
 robots
 come
 for
 the
 blue
 collar


work,
 I
 I
 think
 the
 blue
 collar,
 you


could
 argue,
 is
 a
 bit
 more
 safer
 than


the
 white
 collar


because
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 stuff
 maybe
 it


maybe
 it's
 just
 not
 as
 needed
 in
 the
 age


of
 AI.


And
 yes,
 every
 business
 needs
 marketing


100%.
 But
 it's
 like
 again,
 Amazon
 ads,


it's
 it's it's
 a
 great
 business.
 is
 I


think
 it's
 doing
 $45
 billion
 run
 rate.


You
 have
 to
 ask
 yourself
 if
 you
 get
 rid


of a
 lot
 of the
 people
 managing
 that


ecosystem
 and
 that
 platform,
 what


happens
 to
 the
 run
 rate?
 Does
 it


increase,
 decrease?
 Does
 it
 get
 more


margin
 efficient?
 And
 look,
 there's
 ways


this
 goes
 against
 you.
 Like
 if
 Meta
 were


to
 cut,
 and
 Meta
 has
 done
 this
 back
 in


2019.
 They
 cut
 a
 ton
 of
 um
 trust
 and


safety
 people
 in
 their
 ads
 division


because
 Zux
 was
 trying
 to,
 you
 know,


make
 better
 margins
 and
 increase


efficiency.
 and
 you
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 ads


that
 got
 approved
 on
 Meta.
 We're
 talking


pornography.
 We're
 talking
 about


terrorism.
 We're
 talking
 about
 all
 this


crazy
 [ __ ]
 that
 would
 have
 been
 stopped


if
 you
 had
 trust
 and
 safety.
 Well,
 now


fast
 forward
 5
 years
 later.
 I'm
 not


saying
 AI
 is
 perfect
 at
 trust
 and


safety,
 but
 I
 imagine
 Med
 is
 training


some
 models
 to
 get
 really
 good
 at


recognizing
 when
 an
 ad
 shouldn't
 be


approved
 and
 they
 might
 not
 need
 a


content
 moderator
 to
 physically
 do
 that.


And
 that's
 just
 that's
 just
 like
 Uber


versus
 the
 taxis,
 right?
 That's
 just
 it


is
 what
 it
 like
 that's
 going
 to
 happen.


And
 the
 question
 then
 becomes
 where


you
 know
 where
 does
 the
 market
 go
 or


where
 does
 the
 economy
 go
 if
 that
 places


if
 that
 actually
 takes
 place.


Okay.
 I
 saw
 this
 headline
 yesterday.


Peter
 Tealback
 substrate
 raised
 100


million
 at
 1
 billion
 to
 develop
 a
 new


X-ray
 lithography
 system
 that
 aims
 to


reduce
 advanced
 chip
 production
 costs


and
 provide
 a
 US
 alternative
 to
 ASML.


This
 was
 actually
 a
 headline
 we
 didn't


cover
 yesterday.
 It's
 a
 big
 deal
 in
 my


opinion
 because
 you've
 got
 this
 big


American
 manufacturing
 push
 from
 Trump


around
 semiconductors.
 ASML
 is
 is


essentially
 a
 monopoly
 um
 in


lithography.
 If
 you
 got
 Peter
 Teal


saying,
 "Hey,
 I'm
 going
 to
 fund
 a


company
 that's
 going
 to
 try
 to
 compete


with
 these
 guys
 in
 the
 US.


Name
 is
 Substrate
 valued
 at
 a
 billion."


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 bearish
 ASML,
 but


it's
 definitely
 more
 bullish
 American


manufacturing
 when
 it comes
 to


semiconductors.


So,
 you
 do
 have
 that
 headline
 that
 is


important.


Kruba
 says,
 "I
 admit
 I
 left
 my
 full-time


job
 in
 mid-Sepptemeber
 after
 crossing


seven
 figures
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 in


five
 years
 to
 focus
 on
 my
 digital


publishing
 business."
 Yeah,
 look,
 I've


heard
 that
 story
 from
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys.


Uh
 that
 you've
 been
 able
 to
 leave
 the


job
 due
 to
 the
 market
 and
 and
 it
 goes


back
 to
 this
 this
 trend
 we've
 been


talking
 about
 for
 the
 past
 two
 years


now,
 which
 is
 if
 you
 own
 assets,
 it's


been
 a
 fun
 ride.
 If
 you
 don't,
 it's


tough.
 And
 the
 assets
 give
 you
 the
 the


the
 potential
 freedom,
 the
 flexibility


to
 maybe
 make
 other
 decisions.


But
 most
 people
 don't,
 right?
 Most


people
 just
 they
 don't
 care
 about
 the


state.
 They're
 not
 watching
 the
 stock


market
 stream
 at
 12:30.
 They're
 they're


doing
 something
 else.
 They
 don't
 care


about
 it.


And
 that's
 where
 you
 have
 the
 majority


of
 of
 Americans,
 definitely
 in
 this


country.
 And
 then,
 you
 know,
 then
 you


have
 to
 deal
 with
 the
 nature
 of
 how
 it's


perceived


when
 companies
 do
 make
 decisions
 that


are
 more
 friendly
 toward
 shareholders


versus
 employees.
 Pal's
 at
 2:30
 for


those
 that
 are
 asking.
 Pal's
 at
 2:30.


We'll
 get
 the
 update
 in
 an
 hour
 30


on
 what
 happens
 for
 the
 FOMC.


We're
 going
 to
 get
 the
 rate
 cut.
 It's


just
 the
 question
 of
 how
 much
 the
 street


reacts
 to
 it.
 Also,
 I
 want
 to
 see
 who
 uh


who
 like
 who
 says
 yes,
 who
 says
 no.
 Is


it
 unanimous?
 Is
 it
 like
 a
 couple
 of


these
 Fed
 presidents
 said
 we
 don't
 need


to
 cut?
 I
 wonder
 what
 JPAL's
 commentary


is
 on
 the
 labor
 market.
 Obviously,


that's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 important,


but
 all
 that
 stuff
 matters.


I
 made
 thoughts
 on
 covered
 calls
 this


week
 for
 earnings.
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to


pick
 which
 strike
 you're
 comfortable


with.
 So
 if
 you
 own
 Google,
 you
 have
 at


least
 a
 100
 shares.
 Let's
 say
 you
 bought


it
 at
 220.
 Google's
 at
 270.


You
 have
 to
 ask
 yourself,
 you
 know,
 do
 I


think
 Google
 can
 get
 to
 290
 by
 the
 end


of
 the
 week.
 Maybe
 you
 saw
 the
 cover


call
 at
 290.
 If
 you
 think
 Google's


overextended
 and
 it's
 going
 back
 down
 to


250,
 maybe
 you saw
 the
 cover
 call
 at


275.


General,
 I'm
 a
 bit
 hesitant
 for
 calls
 on


earnings
 because
 you
 just
 don't
 know


what's
 going
 to
 happen.
 And
 unless


you're
 really
 confident
 that
 you're


ready
 to
 exit
 Google
 at
 280
 and


therefore
 you
 sell
 the
 call
 at
 280,


maybe
 get
 three
 bucks
 a
 premium,
 so


technically
 you're
 selling
 at
 283
 and


you're
 totally
 okay
 with
 selling
 at
 280,


then
 I
 would
 avoid
 calls
 because
 it's


just
 like
 you
 never
 know
 what
 if
 the


numbers
 are
 so
 gigantic


that
 it
 just
 like
 and
 then
 you
 want
 to


keep
 the
 shares,
 right?
 And
 you
 get


annoyed
 that
 you
 ended
 up
 selling
 the


call.


So,
 it's
 really
 just
 a
 question
 of
 how


you
 want
 to
 want
 to
 hedge.
 Neo
 says,
 "I


got
 laid
 off
 in
 my
 family's
 real
 estate


office
 today.
 Was
 told
 to
 focus
 on
 the


market.
 It's
 a
 bittersweet
 feeling."


Who
 laid
 you
 off,
 Neo?
 Was
 that
 like


your
 like
 was
 it
 your
 immediate
 family?


Was
 it
 mom,
 dad?
 Or
 was
 it
 was
 it
 like
 a


distant
 family
 like
 cousins?


But
 look,
 if
 they're
 saying
 to
 folks
 on


the
 market
 and
 potentially
 manage
 some


of
 the
 family
 money,
 that's
 also
 not
 a


horrible
 idea.


But
 I
 mean
 like
 even
 like
 like
 the
 fact


that
 you
 said
 even
 in
 your
 family's


business
 you
 had
 to
 lay
 off.


It's
 tough,
 right?
 My
 big
 brother.
 Damn.


Okay.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 see,
 and
 here's
 the


thing,
 right?
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 the


relationship
 you
 have
 with
 your
 big


brother,
 but
 your
 brother
 just
 might
 be


saying,
 "Dude,
 we
 can't
 afford
 it."


Right?


And
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 doing
 well
 in


the
 markets,
 maybe
 that's
 why
 he's


saying
 you
 can
 focus
 on
 the
 markets


because
 we
 can't
 afford
 to
 pay
 you.


But
 that's
 like
 that
 just
 goes
 dude
 over


the
 past
 48
 hours
 my
 entire
 mood
 has


changed
 on
 the
 labor
 market.
 This
 15


thou
 like
 15,000
 emails
 were
 sent
 last


night
 from
 Amazon


at
 once.
 All
 at
 once
 right
 before


earnings
 because
 they
 know
 they
 had
 to


just
 rip
 it
 off
 and
 they
 did
 it
 at
 5


a.m.
 Seattle
 time
 to
 make
 sure
 people


wouldn't
 come
 into
 the
 office.
 Like


it
 is
 starting
 to
 highlight
 a
 much


bigger
 issue
 that
 I
 don't
 know
 is


structural
 yet
 but
 I
 do
 know
 is
 related


to
 AI.


But
 I'm
 happy
 you're
 here,
 Neo.


Hopefully,
 you
 know,
 being
 part
 of
 the


chat
 and


being
 part
 of
 the
 community
 can
 create
 a


little
 bit
 of
 solace
 today.


Family
 business
 has
 always
 been
 tough,


dude.
 I
 I
 have
 some
 experience
 with
 this


because
 my
 dad
 and
 my
 uncle,
 his


brother,
 and
 my
 grandpa,
 they
 all
 ran


the
 liquor
 store
 together.
 And
 dude,


family
 business
 like,
 you
 know,
 like


it's
 just
 there's
 there's
 always
 some


dispute
 about
 something,
 you
 know,
 like


like
 the
 biggest
 dispute
 my
 family
 had


was
 and
 my
 mom
 got
 really
 pissed
 off


about
 this,
 but
 my
 dad
 worked
 Monday


through
 Friday
 in
 the
 liquor
 store.


Sorry,
 Monday
 through
 Saturday
 and
 then


nights
 on
 Sunday.
 So
 like
 literally
 my


dad
 worked
 six
 and
 a
 half
 days
 a
 week


and
 my
 uncle
 only
 worked
 Saturday
 and


Sunday.
 But
 when
 it
 came
 time
 to
 split


the
 profits,
 they
 did
 it
 50/50.
 And
 my


dad
 is
 again
 my
 dad's
 a
 family
 guy.
 My


dad
 is
 like
 nothing
 gets
 in
 between


family.


My
 dad,
 you
 know,
 it's
 he's
 just
 it's


it's
 part
 of
 the
 Indian
 culture
 as
 well,


but
 my
 dad's
 like,
 I
 don't
 care
 if
 I


work
 more
 than
 you,
 you
 work
 more
 than


me.
 It's
 it
 we're
 always
 equal.
 And
 my


mom
 is
 like,
 okay,
 but
 he
 works
 two
 days


a
 week.
 You're
 working
 six
 days.
 I
 don't


think.
 And
 so
 the
 amount
 of
 fights
 that


created
 when
 we
 were
 growing
 up
 because


like,
 you
 know,
 my
 mom
 would
 be
 like,


"We're
 broke."
 And
 my
 dad
 is
 like,
 "I'm


doing
 the
 best
 I
 can."
 And
 my
 and
 my


mom's
 like, "No,
 no,
 you
 can
 increase


your
 paycheck
 tomorrow
 if
 you
 just
 don't


split
 the
 money
 5050."
 My
 dad's
 like,


"Nope.
 I
 have
 these
 are
 my
 values.
 I


can't
 I
 can't
 negotiate
 here."


And
 that's
 just
 how
 it
 is.
 You
 know,


some
 family
 business
 can
 get
 messy,
 bro.


Family
 business
 can
 get
 messy.


Yeah.
 I
 know.
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 here


agreeing
 with
 my
 mom,
 but
 I
 also
 look
 I


as
 after
 understanding
 how
 my
 dad
 thinks


like
 there
 was
 no
 way
 she
 was
 ever
 going


to
 convince
 him
 to
 not
 do
 it
 50.
 There's


just
 no
 way.
 Like
 my
 dad
 is
 who
 he
 is.


Sometimes
 you
 can't
 you
 can't
 get


changed,
 right?


So


family
 business
 always
 has
 a
 variety
 of


different
 different
 nuances
 of
 it.


Damn.
 Oatmeal
 oatmeal
 cookie
 hater,


which
 I
 love
 that
 name.
 I
 hate
 oatmeal


cookies
 as
 well.
 Well,
 I
 I'm
 okay
 with


oatmeal
 cookies.
 Oatmeal
 raisin
 cookies.


No,
 that
 we
 need
 to
 talk
 about
 Steve


with
 that.
 Oatmeal
 raisin
 cookies
 are


disgusting.
 He
 says,
 "My
 grandpa
 laid


off
 my
 mom
 and
 died
 a
 year
 later.
 He
 was


91
 and
 the
 rent
 was
 too
 high,
 but
 he


couldn't
 survive
 not
 working
 every
 day."


It's
 crazy,
 man.
 It's
 crazy
 how
 some
 of


this
 stuff
 happens,
 especially
 when
 you


get
 to
 an
 older
 age
 and
 you
 still
 have


to
 work.
 That's
 partly
 why
 I've
 been
 so


focused
 on
 getting
 my
 mom
 and
 dad
 into


investing
 because
 I'm
 like,
 dude,


they're
 gonna
 retire.
 Like,
 my
 dad
 has


to
 retire
 in
 like
 the
 next
 two
 years.


I'm
 trying
 to
 get
 him
 to
 retire
 right


now.
 And
 like,
 you
 know,
 like
 I
 I
 think


there's
 a
 world
 in
 which
 he
 could


retire.
 He's
 just
 really
 stubborn
 as


well
 and
 he's
 not
 doing
 it.
 I'm
 like,


dude,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 70
 in
 a
 couple


years.
 You
 cannot
 keep
 working
 the
 way


you're
 working.
 Uh
 my
 mom
 is
 more
 white


collar
 work
 and
 she's
 definitely
 going


to
 retire
 in
 a
 couple
 years.
 And
 you


know,
 I
 want
 them
 to
 be
 wellversed
 in


the
 markets
 and
 being
 able
 to
 have
 a


nest
 egg
 and
 not
 have
 to
 worry
 about


just
 the
 pension


and
 for
 them
 to
 be
 able
 to
 create
 income


for
 themselves.


So
 like
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 the
 most


important
 thing
 and
 this
 is
 the


disservice
 this
 country
 does.
 Like
 we


don't
 teach
 people
 when
 they're
 young


because
 when
 you
 get
 older,
 you
 cannot


just
 rely
 on
 social
 security,
 dude.
 It's


like
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 social
 security


is
 going
 to
 be
 around
 by
 the
 time
 I
 get


to
 that
 age.
 That's
 a
 re
 I
 did
 this


social
 security
 deep
 dive
 a
 year
 ago.
 I


had
 this
 big
 tweet
 that
 went
 viral
 when


I
 when
 I
 when
 I
 talked
 about
 all
 the


findings
 I
 had
 from
 social
 security
 and


the
 stuff
 I
 found
 it
 blew
 my
 about
 how


they
 calculated
 how
 they
 take
 out
 the


money,
 what
 percentage
 is
 there,
 how


much
 is
 even
 left
 in
 the
 reserve.
 The


biggest
 thing
 I
 found
 out
 is
 that


freaking
 Clinton
 Clinton
 wanted
 to
 put


the
 entire
 reserve
 in
 the
 S&P
 500
 for


social
 security
 back
 in
 1994.


It
 was
 1991
 roundabout.


um
 it
 was
 two
 trillion
 at
 the
 time
 and


he
 was
 like
 let's
 just
 dump
 it
 into
 the


S&P.
 He
 would
 have
 had
 to
 gone
 through


2008,
 the
 dotcom
 bubble,
 2020,
 but
 still


it
 would
 have
 done
 very
 well
 if
 they


just
 dumped
 it
 into
 the
 S&P.
 They
 took
 a


vote.
 Congress
 said,
 "No,
 it's
 too


risky.
 Put
 it
 into
 treasuries."
 And
 then


Bush
 Bush
 came
 in
 and
 he
 tried
 to
 do
 it


again.
 He
 said, "This
 is
 a
 good
 idea.


Let's
 put
 it
 into
 the
 market.
 Let's
 not


leave
 it
 in
 the
 treasuries."
 Congress


voted.
 They
 said,
 "Nope."


And
 now
 it
 looks
 like
 by
 2035


either
 we're
 gonna
 have
 to
 raise
 the


percentage
 that
 we
 take
 from
 people


today
 on
 social
 security
 to
 fill
 up
 the


reserves
 or
 we're
 gonna
 have
 to
 give
 the


people
 on
 social
 security
 right
 now
 less


benefits.
 And
 that's
 the
 most


um
 that
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 the
 the
 the


hardest
 politically


it's
 the
 hardest
 way
 to
 sell


politically.
 Like
 the
 political
 capital


of
 anyone
 who
 agrees
 with
 that
 is
 tough


because
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 older
 people


that
 outnumber
 younger
 people.
 And
 if


you
 say,
 "Hey,
 vote
 for
 me.
 I'm
 going
 to


decrease
 your
 benefits
 on
 social


security."
 It's
 easier
 to
 say,
 "I'm


going
 to
 take
 more
 from
 the


25-year-old's
 paycheck
 than
 I'm
 going
 to


decrease
 from
 the
 70."


But
 it's
 one
 or
 the
 other.
 Quite


frankly,
 it's
 got
 to
 probably
 be
 both


because
 we
 don't
 have
 the
 money
 to
 pay


for
 this
 [ __ ]


And
 unfortunately,
 we
 we
 put
 it
 into


freaking
 treasuries
 and
 it's
 ironically


going
 to
 get
 us
 into
 more
 debt.
 Yeah.


And
 then
 here's
 the
 other
 thing
 by
 Zo


right
 there.
 Retirement
 age
 likely's
 got


to
 go
 up.
 What
 is
 it?
 I
 think
 it's
 like


60.
 What
 is
 the
 official
 retirement
 age?


It's
 like
 64,
 right?
 It's
 65.


Anyone
 born
 in
 1960
 or
 later,
 it's
 67.


Yeah,
 that's
 going
 to
 70,
 bro.
 There's


no
 way
 this
 is
 not
 going
 higher.
 Like
 we


we
 we
 cannot
 afford
 to
 pay
 everybody.


Of
 course
 it's
 67.
 Of
 course,


of
 course
 it's
 67.
 Why
 not?
 But


it's
 based
 on
 the
 year
 you
 were
 born.


Okay.
 Well,
 anyone
 born
 after
 1960,


which
 is
 when
 you're
 you're
 starting
 to


get
 into
 those
 older
 ages.
 67
 right
 now.


Yeah.
 I
 think
 when
 I
 get
 to
 that,
 dude,


it's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 be
 older.
 Like


>> and
 then
 you
 know
 social
 security
 you


get
 social
 security


as
 a
 function
 of
 the
 money
 you


contribute
 during
 your
 younger
 years
 in


a
 job.
 If
 you
 have
 this
 layoff
 uh
 new


world
 we're
 getting
 into
 where
 we
 where


Elon
 says
 working
 a
 job
 is
 optional.


Well
 then
 where
 is
 the
 social
 security


coming
 from
 when
 you're
 older
 because


you're
 again
 you're
 contributing
 when


you're
 younger
 to
 get
 paid
 back
 when


you're
 older.
 That's
 the
 whole
 point
 of


it.
 like
 we
 are
 going
 to
 have
 a


fundamentally
 different
 paradigm
 for
 how


we
 think
 of
 the
 economy
 whether
 it's
 UBI


increased
 taxes
 deflation
 I
 I
 don't
 know


how
 you
 would
 define
 it
 but
 if
 it's
 not


through
 the
 traditional
 ecosystem
 of
 of


the
 job
 market


and
 it's
 something
 I
 think
 everyone's


got
 to
 be
 prepared
 for


AWS
 is
 still
 down.
 Yeah,
 we're
 getting
 a


lot
 more
 of
 these
 AWS
 and
 Azure
 and
 Xbox


are
 getting
 hit
 the
 hardest
 right
 here.


Cloudflare.
 Oh,
 Google
 Cloud.
 Look
 at


that.
 that
 just
 spiked
 360
 reports
 on


Google
 Cloud


and
 then
 Cloudflare
 as
 well.
 I
 mean


that's
 Cloudflare
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 the


internet.
 Cloudflare
 just
 got
 200


reports
 as
 well
 as
 it
 spiked.


All
 of
 this
 right
 before
 the
 earnings.


Right
 before
 the
 earnings.


Tossen
 says
 I'm
 28
 as
 well.
 UBI
 is
 going


to
 take
 over
 social
 security.


Are
 we
 under
 attack?
 I
 would
 hope
 not.


That
 wouldn't
 help
 the
 bull
 market.


That
 wouldn't
 be
 the
 best
 thing
 either.


I
 don't
 think
 we're
 under
 attack.
 But


that
 is
 kind
 of
 suspicious
 though.
 All


these
 companies
 getting
 hit
 at
 the
 same


time.


I
 mean,
 if
 it
 was
 just
 AWS
 or
 Azure,


maybe
 it's
 a
 specific
 thing.


I
 don't
 see
 any
 headlines
 on
 cyber


security.


Gold
 is
 up.
 Of
 course,
 gold
 is
 up.
 Well,


it's
 actually
 down
 from
 the
 morning.


It's
 up,
 but
 it's
 still
 below
 4,000.


Is
 it
 China?
 Dude,
 China
 just
 bought
 our


soybeans.
 They
 better
 not
 freaking


attack
 us.
 They
 just
 They
 just
 offered
 a


peace
 treaty
 with
 the
 soybeans.


Of
 course,
 on
 Amidst
 all
 day
 stream,
 the


Martians
 attack.
 Exactly.


It
 has
 been
 happening
 too
 frequently.


That's
 correct.


It
 has
 been
 happening
 a
 bit
 too


frequently.


Oh
 boy.
 All right.
 We're
 going
 to
 have


to
 see.


We're
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 down
 reports
 on


cloud,
 Google
 Cloud,
 Azure,
 Xbox,
 AWS,


and
 then
 Cloudflare.


That's
 what
 we're
 seeing
 across
 the


board.


Yeah,
 we're
 going
 all
 day.
 We'll
 be
 live


all
 day.
 Two
 million
 user
 reports


indicate
 Amazon's
 down
 in
 the
 US
 as
 per


down
 detector.


This
 is
 what
 happens
 when
 Amazon
 fire


see
 everyone's
 going
 to
 be
 like,
 "See,


Amazon
 fired
 a
 bunch
 of
 people.
 No
 one's


there
 to
 do
 the
 work.
 No
 one's
 there
 to


do
 the
 job."
 And
 then
 boom,
 you
 get
 an


outage.


Robin
 is
 working
 okay,
 though,
 and
 so
 is


some
 of
 the
 other
 companies
 that
 were


affected
 last
 week.


But
 everything
 else


looks
 like
 it
 has
 some
 decline.


Do
 they
 need
 Google's
 whiz?


Did
 they
 even
 acquire
 them
 yet?
 That's


still
 pending,
 right?
 There's
 a
 $ 32


billion


March
 18th
 they
 signed
 the
 agreement.


I
 think
 they
 did
 because
 their
 cloud
 I


mean
 I
 their
 cloud
 numbers
 last
 quarter


were
 phenomenal.
 One
 could
 argue
 Whiz


probably


ingested
 a
 couple
 hundred
 million
 of


revenue
 to
 get
 that
 beat


or
 they
 might
 have
 pulled
 it
 forward
 but


pending
 regulatory
 approval
 they
 can


officially
 show
 the
 numbers.


Um,


but
 you
 are
 seeing
 some
 of
 these


services
 that
 are
 down.


Okay.
 What
 else
 do
 we
 got?
 What
 else
 do


we
 got?
 What
 else
 do
 we
 got?
 Anyway,


this
 layoff
 stuff,
 dude,
 is
 crazy.
 This


layoff
 stuff
 is
 absolutely
 crazy.
 Jared,


thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Yeah,
 down


detector.
 Half
 the
 internet.
 What?
 Okay,


so
 what
 websites
 are
 you
 guys
 struggling


with?
 Because
 I'm
 not
 I
 mean,
 is
 Twitter


down?
 Twitter
 seems
 fine.
 YouTube's


obviously
 working.


Yeah,
 Twitter's
 working.
 Look,
 I
 just


got
 Tanner's
 tweet.
 As
 soon
 as
 I
 open


Twitter,


Tanner,
 why
 does
 my
 algorithm
 love
 you,


bro?
 Every
 time
 you
 tweet
 something,


they're
 like,
 "Hey,
 Emit,
 have
 you
 seen


what
 Tanner
 tweeted?"


I'm
 like,
 "No,
 but
 I
 guess
 I
 guess
 I'll


I'll
 I'll
 look
 at
 it
 if
 you're
 going
 to


show
 it
 to
 me."
 Tanner
 SoFi
 updates.


Timothy
 Switzer,
 who
 is
 this
 guy?


He's
 one
 of
 the
 most
 SoFi
 bearish


analysts.
 He
 had
 a
 $8
 target
 in
 March.


Now
 he
 has
 a
 $20
 target
 after
 earnings.


Timothy
 Switzer.
 He
 is
 from
 KBW.
 Oh


yeah,
 yeah,
 yeah.
 I
 remember
 this
 guy.


This
 guy
 got
 clowned


a
 couple
 months
 ago.


KBW
 has
 been
 a
 bit
 weird
 on
 a
 lot
 of


these
 names.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 they've


been
 bullish
 hood,
 but
 it
 took
 them
 some


time
 as
 well.


Dude,
 Richie
 still
 gave
 Pounder
 a
 $45


price
 target
 for
 those
 that
 missed
 that.


He
 reiterated
 it
 yesterday.


I
 was
 like,
 Richishy,
 come
 on
 now.
 You


can
 be
 bearish,
 but
 45,


it's
 a
 bit
 aggressive.


197
 almost
 back
 to
 197
 on
 Pounder.
 Azure


says,
 "We
 have
 taken
 action
 that
 is


expected
 to
 address
 the
 portal
 access


issues
 here
 shortly."
 Oh,
 speaking
 of


Microsoft,
 dude,
 Nadella
 dropped
 some


bombs
 in
 terms
 of
 some
 stories
 around


OpenAI.
 Here's
 what
 he
 said
 yesterday


about
 how
 he
 thought
 about
 OpenAI
 and


when
 they
 initially


invested
 back
 in
 2019.


>> A1
 billion
 for
 sure.
 How
 big
 of
 a
 deal


was
 uh
 writing
 a
 a1
 billion
 dollar
 check


back
 then?
 I
 mean
 big
 company
 Microsoft


we
 think
 it
 makes
 revenues
 around
 a


billion
 dollars
 a
 business
 day.
 Uh
 was


it
 one
 day
 of
 work
 from
 you
 or
 was
 it
 or


was
 it
 you
 know
 weeks
 of
 negotiation?


Seriously?
 Did
 you
 build
 memos?
 Like


were
 you
 building
 Excel
 sheets?
 Like


what
 were
 you
 thinking?


>> Even
 at
 Microsoft
 you
 kind
 of
 got
 have


to
 get
 a
 board
 approval.
 Just
 go
 throw
 a


billion
 dollars
 out
 of
 the
 air.
 But
 you


know
 I
 must
 say
 it
 was
 not
 that
 hard
 to


convince
 uh
 anyone
 that
 this
 is
 an


important


>> area
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 risky
 like
 I


mean
 in
 retrospect
 I
 mean
 who
 would
 have


thought
 hey
 I
 didn't
 put
 in
 that
 you


know
 billion
 dollars
 saying
 oh
 yeah
 this


is
 going
 to
 be
 whatundagger


I
 mean
 that's
 not
 like
 what
 was
 going


through
 our
 head
 which
 this
 is
 a
 a


partnership
 that
 I
 mean
 by
 the
 way


remember
 this
 was
 a
 nonprofit
 right
 and


I
 think
 you
 know
 Bill
 even
 said
 yeah


you're
 going
 to
 burn
 this
 billion


dollars
 right
 and
 yeah
 We
 kind
 of
 had
 a


little
 bit
 of
 high
 risk
 tolerance.


Totally.


>> Um
 and
 we
 said
 we
 want
 to
 go
 and
 give


this
 a
 shot.
 Uh
 and
 then
 of
 course
 we


subsequently
 um
 you
 know
 here
 we
 are
 at


GitHub
 universe.
 In
 fact
 this
 is


probably
 the
 place


>> where
 that
 billion
 to
 10
 billion


happened
 because
 in
 21


>> uh
 is
 when
 I
 first
 saw
 GitHub
 copilot.


>> Sure.


>> And
 I
 said
 man
 this
 is
 working.


>> This
 a
 year
 before
 the
 release.


>> Uh
 no
 actually
 in
 fact
 I
 was


fact-checking
 my
 thing.
 I
 think
 GitHub


uh
 co-pilot
 launched
 in
 21,
 Chat
 GPD
 in


22.


>> Sure.


>> And
 if
 I
 remember
 right,
 23
 is
 the
 blip,


the
 the
 November
 blip
 with
 OpenAI,
 and


then
 everything
 has
 been
 smooth
 since


then.


>> The
 blip.


>> That's
 the
 nicest
 way
 you
 could
 put


that.
 That's
 fantastic.


>> Linear,
 meet
 the
 system
 for
 modern


software
 development.
 Linear
 is
 a


>> Okay,
 so
 then
 this
 was
 the
 other
 clip


right
 here
 about
 Nadella
 talking
 a
 bit


more
 about
 Amazon
 as
 well.


We
 I
 mean
 we've
 heard
 this
 thing
 a
 while


ago
 uh
 it
 just
 comes
 up
 again
 and
 again


with
 uh
 public
 SAS
 companies
 that
 are


maybe
 a
 little bit
 more
 of
 a
 point


solution
 and
 they
 have
 to
 go
 through
 a


business
 model
 transition
 and
 that
 can


be
 harder
 than
 a
 tech
 transition
 and
 we


hear
 about
 oh
 well
 if
 you
 want
 to
 change


your
 business
 model
 maybe
 you
 want
 to
 be


private
 but
 it
 feels
 like
 is
 there
 some


sort
 of
 advantage
 of
 being
 a
 hyperscaler


a
 $4
 trillion
 company
 that
 you
 can
 go


and
 retool
 a
 piece
 of
 the
 business
 over


here
 change
 the
 business
 model
 and
 and


have
 almost
 the
 the
 privilege
 of,
 you


know,
 not
 having
 shareholders
 come
 to


you
 and
 beat
 you
 down
 about
 a
 slight


shift
 in
 a
 business
 model
 in
 a


subdivision.
 That's
 that
 you
 don't
 get


that.


>> I
 can't
 deny
 that,
 you
 know,
 diversity


of
 business
 models,
 diversity
 of
 the


portfolio
 that
 Microsoft
 has
 has
 been


helpful.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 kind
 of
 uh
 but


that
 said,
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 can
 take


that
 and
 say
 somehow
 you
 can
 make
 it


>> if
 you
 don't
 reinvent
 yourself.
 So,
 I


think
 what
 happens
 in
 tech
 unfortunately


Yeah.
 is
 that
 when
 these
 shifts
 happen,


>> yeah,


>> whether
 you
 like
 it
 or
 not,
 you
 have
 to


first
 be
 relevant
 after
 having
 it


doesn't
 matter
 what
 the
 business
 model


is.
 The
 business
 model
 may
 be
 like,
 hey,


I
 had
 whatever
 90%
 margins,
 you
 are


going
 to
 at
 best
 have
 10%.


>> But
 you
 have
 to
 jump
 all
 in
 because
 even


that
 90
 is
 going
 to
 zero.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so
 given
 the
 binary
 nature,
 you
 got


to
 make
 it
 to
 the
 other
 side.


>> But
 then
 the
 category
 economics
 matters,


right?
 Because
 if
 you
 can't
 sustain


long-term
 innovation
 if
 there
 is
 no


category
 economics,
 I
 mean
 hypers
 scale


is
 a
 great
 one.
 In
 fact,
 the
 best
 day
 in


hypers
 scale
 business
 was
 the
 day
 Amazon


announced
 their
 operating
 margins


IPO.


>> Yeah,
 it
 you
 know
 because
 that's
 where


nobody
 knew
 hypers
 scale
 business
 is
 an


unbelievable
 business.
 It's
 a
 commodity


but
 at
 scale
 nothing
 is
 a
 commodity.
 Uh


and
 so
 to
 me
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 going
 to
 be


the
 key
 here.
 even
 SAS
 applications.


>> Quickly
 unpack
 why
 that
 was
 so
 good
 for


you
 again
 just
 because
 the
 market


recognized
 that
 you
 were
 in
 the
 same


business
 and
 it
 was
 fantastic.
 That
 was


one
 and
 more
 importantly
 it
 was
 much


more
 expensive
 right
 I
 mean
 think
 about


our
 server
 business
 right
 super


profitable


>> except
 it
 was
 onetenth


>> the
 size
 when
 I
 look
 at
 it
 compared
 to


Azure


>> so
 we
 like
 we
 sold
 a
 few
 servers
 but
 man


we
 sell
 a
 lot
 of
 cloud
 VMs


>> uh
 or
 containers
 who
 would
 have
 thought


how
 expansive


>> the
 cloud
 consumption
 model
 is
 going
 to


be
 in
 terms
 of
 people
 being
 able
 to
 sort


of
 it's
 kind
 of
 the
 Germans
 paradox
 that


sort
 really
 played
 out
 in
 a
 massive
 way


if
 you
 broadly.


>> Yeah,


>> it's
 kind
 of
 crazy,
 right?
 Basically,


Nadella
 saying,
 "Hey,
 once
 Amazon
 showed


us
 that
 there
 are
 margins
 in
 a


hyperscaler
 world,
 it
 gave
 the
 street
 a


lot
 because
 Amazon
 was
 the
 original


first
 hyperscaler
 with
 cloud.
 It
 gave


the
 street
 a
 lot
 more
 liberty
 to
 respect


the
 Microsofts
 of
 the
 world
 that
 had


good
 margins
 but
 not
 the
 same
 type
 of


volume,
 sacrifice
 some
 of
 that
 margin
 to


get
 more
 volume
 if
 they
 could
 at least


keep
 a
 bit
 of
 it.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


Microsoft
 is,
 you
 know,
 the
 $4
 trillion


company
 that
 it
 is
 today.
 But
 it
 is
 down


as
 well


based
 on
 this
 Azure
 stuff.
 Microsoft


right
 there
 538


down
 half
 a
 percent.
 Tesla's
 GTA
 6
 is


delayed
 again.
 Wasn't
 it
 supposed
 to
 was


Isn't
 the
 time
 frame
 May
 2026?


Did
 they
 delay
 it
 from
 May
 2026?


The
 last
 time
 I
 played
 Grand
 Theft
 Auto


was
 literally
 a
 decade
 ago.
 I
 played


Vice
 City
 on
 my
 PSP.


Um,
 but
 I
 didn't
 play
 GTA
 5.


Dude,
 if
 it's
 delayed
 from
 May
 2026


again,
 that'd
 be
 crazy.
 That
 That's
 take


two.
 That's
 your
 exposure.
 Chris


actually
 had
 Chris
 literally
 picked
 this


in
 the
 draft
 just
 because
 of
 Grand
 Theft


Auto.


Um,


you
 do
 have
 this
 one
 basically
 flat
 on


the
 day.


It's
 because
 you
 have
 no
 life
 of
 it.


Dude,
 I
 got
 the
 Nintendo
 DS
 over
 the


summer
 thinking
 I
 would
 start
 playing


Super
 Mario
 Brothers.
 I
 played
 for
 like


two
 hours
 and
 then
 I
 don't
 even
 know


where
 the
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 where
 it
 is


anymore,
 dude.
 I
 thought
 I
 was
 going
 to


like
 legit
 play
 this,


but
 I
 have
 not
 had
 a
 chance
 to
 play
 it.


Uh,


is
 the
 rate
 cut
 good
 for
 Bitcoin?
 Yeah,


I
 mean,
 we'll
 do
 a
 poll
 right
 here
 in


the
 chat.
 The
 rate
 cut
 is
 good
 for
 like


everything,


but


we
 got
 to
 see
 if
 it
 happens.
 Market
 pump


or
 dump
 after
 FOMC?
 What
 do
 we
 think?


Pump
 or
 dump
 after
 FOMC?
 I
 have
 that


interview
 coming
 out
 uh
 with
 the
 with


the
 Palanteer
 author
 Michael
 Steinberger


soon.
 Uh
 hopefully
 tomorrow
 I
 got
 to


finish
 editing
 it.
 But
 um
 yeah,
 that
 was


from
 the
 book
 that
 I
 read
 and
 I
 think


that'll
 be a
 good
 interview
 as
 well.
 But


I
 did
 enjoy
 reading
 that
 book
 a
 lot
 more


than


just
 messing
 around
 or
 watching
 videos


or
 something.


Nvidia
 had
 six
 trillion
 before
 GTA
 6
 is


out.
 That
 Yeah,
 the
 fact
 that
 could


legit
 happen.
 I
 mean,
 what's
 another


trillion,
 bro?
 We're
 at
 five
 already,


dude.
 We
 were
 at
 three.
 No,
 we
 were
 at


2.2
 two
 in
 April.
 Then
 we
 got
 to
 three,


start
 to
 recover.
 Then
 we
 got
 to
 four,


big
 deal.
 Now
 we're
 at
 five.
 It's
 like


another
 trill,
 bro.
 What's
 wrong
 with


another
 trill?


Might
 as
 well
 just
 give
 it
 to
 us
 at
 this


point.
 The
 book
 is
 called
 The


Philosopher
 in
 the
 Valley.
 I
 think
 it


comes
 out
 November
 4th.
 It
 really
 is
 a


good
 book
 on
 Karp
 and
 Paler.
 It's
 called


The
 Philosopher
 in
 the
 Valley.


LRN
 is
 down.


Stride.
 Why
 are
 these
 guys
 down
 50%.


This
 is
 a
 $3
 billion
 company.
 Stride
 is


a
 technology
 based
 educational
 company


which
 engages
 in
 the
 provision
 of


proprietary
 and
 third
 party
 curriculum.


Oh,
 this
 this
 you
 know
 just
 off
 that


description.
 This
 is
 screaming
 CHEG
 to


me.
 This
 is
 screaming
 CHEG.


Is
 CHEG
 even
 around
 anymore?


Che's


down
 14.
 who
 had
 earnings
 in
 the


education
 space
 that
 knocked
 off
 all


these
 stocks
 was
 a
 stride.
 They
 have


earnings.
 One
 of
 these
 guys
 had
 earnings


and
 I
 bet
 they
 said,
 "Yeah,
 we
 think
 AI


is
 commoditizing
 curriculum


development."
 Boom.
 Stock
 goes
 down.


Stock
 go
 down.
 CH
 just
 had
 more
 AI


layoffs.
 Oh,
 LRN
 had
 a
 call.
 They


bad
 guidance.
 Okay,
 so
 they
 actually


beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom,
 but
 they


lowered
 their
 guidance
 50%
 though.
 My


goodness,
 dude.


That's
 a
 pretty
 aggressive


downside
 move
 off
 of
 lowering
 guidance.


But
 there
 you
 go.
 CHEG
 is
 doing
 a
 layoff


of
 40%.
 This
 was
 inevitable.
 This
 like


this
 is
 a
 company.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 this


company
 survives.
 Yeah,
 45.
 Wow.
 Back
 to


this
 layoff
 conversation.
 45%.


This
 came
 out
 last
 night
 at
 1:00
 am.
 I


didn't
 even
 see
 this
 one.


My
 goodness,
 dude.
 Nearly
 half
 of


workforce
 due
 to
 the
 new
 realities
 of


AI.


Yeah,
 if
 you
 posted
 in
 the
 chat,
 I
 must


have
 missed
 it.
 Goodness,
 dude.


Now
 see
 if
 Dolingo
 comes
 out
 and
 says


something
 similar
 which
 again
 I
 really


don't
 think
 language
 should
 be
 like
 like


like
 Google
 or
 Amazon
 or
 Apple
 should


kill
 Dolingo


but
 if
 they
 say
 we
 have
 to
 do
 layoffs


then
 that's
 Dualingo
 admitting
 yeah
 we


have
 some
 issues
 and
 we
 might
 have
 to


pick
 margins
 over
 employees.


Is
 there
 Oakland
 news?
 There
 was
 some


news
 about
 nuclear
 power
 this
 morning
 uh


with
 Brookfield
 and
 last
 night.
 That's


why
 Oaklo
 is
 pumping.
 SMR
 is
 that


getting
 a
 pump.
 Yeah,
 SMR
 is
 up
 and
 then


Nanuclear,
 those
 are
 up.
 So,
 all
 those


names
 in
 the
 nuclear
 arena
 getting
 some


love.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 about
 ASST?


Dude,
 I
 I


have
 no
 idea
 why
 people
 got
 so
 excited


about
 this.
 There
 was
 a
 big
 account
 on


Twitter,
 Mike
 Alfred.
 He
 bought
 a


million
 dollars
 worth
 of
 it
 and
 everyone


was
 like,
 "Okay,
 cool.
 Big
 account.


Bought
 a
 million.
 I
 should
 buy
 in
 as


well."
 and
 then
 people
 bought
 it.


I
 have
 not
 heard
 a
 fundamental
 thesis.


Mike
 has
 not
 tweeted
 a
 fundamental


thesis.
 I've
 not
 seen
 any
 deep
 dive
 on


like
 why
 you
 should
 buy
 this
 company.


This
 is
 Vake's


asset
 management
 fund
 that
 he
 was
 going


to
 invest
 in.
 Biotech
 turned
 into
 a


Bitcoin
 treasury.
 Did
 a
 merger
 was
 at


$15.
 Then
 it
 fell
 to
 95
 cents.
 Then
 you


had
 a
 big
 account
 on
 Twitter
 buy
 a


million
 dollars
 worth
 of
 it
 and
 then


everyone
 piled
 in


and
 now
 it's
 down,
 you
 know,
 20%
 over


the
 past
 couple
 days.
 I
 don't
 know,


maybe
 there's
 something
 there.
 But


from
 my
 understanding,
 they
 trade
 below


NAV,
 which
 is
 the
 only
 attractive
 thing.


But
 I
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 why
 it's


attractive
 to
 trade
 below
 NAV.
 If
 you


can
 buy
 a
 company
 that
 trades
 above
 NAV,


now
 one
 would
 say,
 well,
 the
 valuation


is
 more
 attractive.
 Yeah.
 But
 the
 fact


that
 it
 got
 below
 NAV,
 that's
 it's
 a


pretty
 big
 issue,
 right?
 That
 means


there's
 something
 internally
 that


investors
 not
 willing
 to
 pay
 a
 premium


for.
 Whereas
 on
 a
 micro
 strategy,
 I
 feel


like
 it's
 safer
 because
 if
 investors
 are


willing
 to
 pay
 the
 premium,
 even
 if
 the


valuation
 is
 a
 bit
 more
 aggressive,


you're
 getting


and
 that
 could
 be
 happening
 there.
 Going


back
 to
 the
 nuclear
 stuff,
 here
 was
 the


Brookfield
 CEO.
 This
 is
 likely
 why
 Oaklo


and
 all
 those
 other
 names
 are
 up


speaking
 about
 what
 they're
 doing
 with


nuclear
 energy


>> investment
 into
 new
 nuclear
 plants
 in


the
 United
 States.
 And
 uh
 we're
 super


excited
 about
 this.
 And
 and
 probably
 the


most
 important
 thing
 isn't
 the
 80


billion,
 but
 we
 needed
 to
 have
 scale
 to


be
 able
 to
 build
 supply
 chain
 across


America.
 And
 the
 nuclear
 industry
 had


had
 had
 gone
 downhill
 and
 just
 nobody


was
 building
 plants.
 And
 to
 be
 able
 to


build
 the
 first
 one,
 you
 need
 to
 have


the
 the
 belief
 in
 and
 the
 supply
 chain


needs
 to
 believe
 that
 you're
 going
 to


build
 out
 the
 whole
 business
 and
 it's


going to
 be
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 sustain


itself
 for
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time.
 So
 the


whole
 idea
 behind
 this
 is
 that
 we're


going
 to
 build
 out
 the
 new
 industrial


platform
 for
 nuclear
 in
 the
 United


States
 and
 all
 the
 suppliers
 will
 build


it
 out
 and
 we'll
 be
 able
 to
 have
 a
 whole


new
 business
 in
 America
 based
 off
 of


nuclear
 and
 that's
 why
 the
 US
 government


is
 backing
 it
 and
 we're
 we're
 very


excited
 about
 that.


>> How
 is
 it
 structured?
 So
 do
 you
 do
 you


line
 up
 financing?
 The
 uh
 so
 the
 US


government
 is
 buying
 $80
 billion
 of


plants
 uh
 from
 us
 and
 from
 Westinghouse


or
 a
 little
 more
 than
 we
 own
 half
 of
 it


and
 uh
 with
 our
 partner
 Kamico
 and
 uh
 so


Westinghouse
 will
 build
 the
 we'll
 build


all
 the
 plants.
 The
 US
 government
 will


own
 them


>> um
 and
 they're
 they're
 going
 to
 be


financing
 them
 and
 so
 we're
 just
 going


to
 be
 the
 builder
 of
 those
 plants.


Whereas
 on
 last
 week
 we
 announced


another
 transaction
 which
 is
 with
 South


Carolina
 and
 we
 Brookfield
 are
 going
 to


be
 buying
 the
 plant.
 Westinghouse.


>> So,
 this
 is
 why
 the
 nuclear
 names
 are


running
 today.


And
 as
 you
 can
 see,
 Brookfield


committing
 as
 much
 money
 as
 they're


committing.
 That
 is
 obviously
 also


helping
 out.
 Bloom
 Energy
 also
 making
 a


move
 today.
 Fiserve
 a
 little
 bit
 of


recovery.
 It
 was
 down
 more.
 Still
 down


40%
 on
 the
 day.
 Nvidia
 holding
 207
 and


Paler
 holding
 197.


They
 both
 fell
 a
 bit
 from
 their
 highs,


but


still
 holding
 it
 up
 on
 the
 day.
 This
 was


another
 interview
 that
 uh
 the


information
 did
 yesterday
 with
 Paris


Hilton.
 We're
 talking
 about
 how
 this


whole
 AI


new
 life
 cycle
 of
 jobs
 can
 be
 replacing


uh
 jobs
 that
 already
 exist.
 Here's
 what


Paris
 Hilton
 had
 to
 say
 about
 the
 use
 of


AI.


>> I
 am
 the
 biggest
 undercover
 nerd.
 I'm


obsessed
 with
 everything
 to
 do
 with


technology,
 with
 AI,
 and
 I
 use
 it
 daily,


several
 times
 a
 day.
 whe
 whether
 I'm


like
 ideulating
 new
 ideas
 for
 a
 product


line,
 for
 a
 music
 video,
 for
 a
 campaign


or
 photo
 shoot
 or
 just
 different


anything.
 I
 just
 I
 use
 it
 all
 the
 time.


And
 I've
 been
 working
 I've
 partnered


with
 Google
 um
 with
 Gemini.
 So
 I've
 been


using
 Gemini
 on
 my
 Android
 Motorola
 era


razor
 every
 single
 day.
 I
 love
 how
 I
 can


because
 I
 am
 such
 a
 creative
 person.
 I'm


constantly
 thinking
 of
 so
 many
 ideas,


but
 I
 love
 how
 with
 the
 AI,
 I
 can
 really


capture
 those
 ideas
 and
 turn
 them
 into


reality
 faster
 because
 it's
 just
 with


anything,
 making
 mood
 boards,
 you
 could


just
 anything
 your
 mind
 can
 think
 of,
 it


could
 right
 away
 either,
 you
 know,


produce
 an
 image
 or,
 you
 know,
 an
 entire


script
 or
 different
 types
 of
 products.


Even
 when
 I'm
 doing
 music,
 sometimes


I'll
 like
 put
 it
 in
 there
 as
 well
 and
 be


like,
 how
 would
 you
 make
 this
 sound
 even


more
 like
 me?
 So,
 it's
 really


interesting
 and
 I've
 actually
 been


having
 an
 AI
 trained
 model
 at
 Paris


Hilton
 one
 that
 we've
 been
 training
 for


several
 years
 now
 before
 anyone
 was


really
 even
 talking
 about
 AI.
 So,
 again,


I've
 always
 been
 ahead
 of
 the
 curve
 in


this.
 It
 is
 pretty
 crazy
 because
 I
 think


a
 lot
 of
 the
 creatives
 are
 going
 to
 try


to
 benefit
 from
 what
 AI
 can
 do
 as
 a


tool,
 but
 the
 fact
 that
 she's
 training
 a


model
 that's
 based
 off
 Paris
 Hilton,


uh,
 you
 know,
 the
 inevitable
 question


becomes,
 could
 that
 replace
 Paris


Hilton?
 And
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 for
 the


actual


value
 of
 creativity?


But
 yeah,
 you
 got
 Paris
 Hilton


discussing
 AI,
 which
 is
 going
 to
 show


how
 widespread
 this
 industry
 is
 starting


to
 become.
 Let's
 get
 an
 update
 on
 the


Fed.
 Again,
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 that


decision
 in
 about
 55
 minutes,


but
 let's
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 coverage


here
 and
 see
 what
 we
 think
 is
 going
 to


happen.


>> Too
 aggressive
 until
 it
 could
 resolve


the
 conflict
 between
 high
 GDP
 growth
 and


lackluster
 employment
 gains.
 Well,


futures
 markets
 have
 priced
 in
 a
 98%


chance
 of
 a
 cut
 today
 and
 84%
 of
 one
 in


December.
 Less
 certain
 about
 a
 January


cut
 with
 just
 a
 42%
 probability.
 More


certainty
 into
 April
 or
 March,
 sorry,


into
 March.
 One
 dovish
 offset
 could
 be


the
 announcement
 by
 the
 Fed
 that
 it's


ending
 the
 runoff
 of
 its
 balance
 sheet.


Quantitative
 tightening
 maybe
 as
 soon
 as


this
 year
 or
 early
 next
 year.
 That
 could


mean
 a
 renewal
 of
 purchases
 next
 year
 to


offset
 the
 natural
 runoff
 of
 securities,


not
 QE
 though.
 But
 the
 uncertainty
 over


rates
 is
 a
 direct
 fallout
 from
 the


shutdown.
 The
 Fed
 is
 forced
 to
 both
 make


and
 guide
 policy
 without
 key
 data
 and
 it


could
 dial
 back
 that
 guidance.
 Now,
 Dom,


>> is
 there
 any
 uh
 indication
 right
 now,


Steve?
 We
 know
 that
 the
 Fed
 is
 going
 to


come
 to
 a
 decision.
 They
 have
 to
 come
 to


one.
 What
 exactly
 they
 have
 been
 looking


at?
 what
 have
 they
 been
 kind
 of


evaluating
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 the


government
 data
 XCPI
 that
 we
 got
 last


week?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 good
 question.
 I
 expect


maybe
 it
 to
 be
 asked
 at
 the
 meeting.
 Uh


uh
 Dom,
 well,
 we
 know
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the


data
 that
 they
 look
 at
 is
 stuff
 that
 we


get.
 It's
 their
 regional
 Fed
 surveys


that
 when
 you
 put
 them
 all
 together,


they
 kind
 of
 give
 you
 a
 pretty
 decent


picture
 of
 what's
 happening.
 Employment


and
 prices.
 There
 are
 some
 private


sector
 inflation
 series
 that
 we're
 all


looking
 at.
 Um
 and
 I
 think
 they
 get
 some


other
 data,
 too.
 some
 high
 frequency
 um


credit
 card
 data
 may
 be
 something


they're
 also
 looking
 at.
 So
 I
 I
 think


they
 have
 the
 data,
 but
 I
 also
 think
 Dom


that
 they
 would
 say
 that
 they
 don't
 have


all
 of
 the
 data
 they
 need
 and
 that
 this


government
 data
 is
 very
 important
 to


determine
 where
 the
 economy
 is
 and
 where


it's
 going.


>> All right,
 not
 flying
 blind,
 but
 maybe


slightly
 visually
 impaired
 there.
 Steve,


thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 that.
 That's
 the


setup
 for
 the
 Fed.
 Let's
 talk
 now
 about


the
 setup
 for
 investors
 ahead
 of
 the


Fed.
 Now,
 Tim,
 we're
 gonna
 start
 with


>> All right,
 folks.
 I
 uh
 I
 got
 a
 guest


who's
 calling
 in.
 Hasn't
 been
 on
 the


stream
 for
 a
 while,
 but
 uh


>> a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 know
 him.
 Sachin,


what's
 up?


>> Doing
 good,
 man.
 Just
 uh
 it's
 uh
 17
 a.m.


in
 the
 night
 in
 K
 and
 I'm
 watching
 you


live
 for
 several
 hours
 now.


>> Well,
 great
 cuz
 because
 now
 you
 get
 to


join
 the
 show
 and
 we
 get
 to
 talk.
 So,
 I


love
 it.
 Um,


>> yeah.


>> So,
 I
 mean,
 there's
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 I


want
 to
 ask
 you,
 but
 let
 me
 let
 me
 start


off
 with
 this
 question.
 Uh,
 the
 the
 the


company
 that
 you
 and
 I
 really
 started


covering
 a
 couple
 years
 ago
 is
 inching


towards
 200.
 What
 are
 your
 thoughts
 in


general
 of
 Pounder?
 You're
 at
 197.


Um
 I
 mean
 to
 be
 honest
 it's
 very


humbling
 and
 I
 was
 reading
 my
 old
 post


and
 watching
 some
 old
 videos
 and
 was


trying
 to
 figure
 it
 out
 like
 I
 mean
 how


did
 I
 able
 to
 identify
 something
 that


able
 to
 grow
 this
 much
 this
 fast
 and
 I


think
 one
 of
 the
 thing
 like
 even
 on
 the


very
 first
 article
 I
 wrote
 was
 that
 uh
 I


wanted
 to
 look
 for
 companies


um
 which
 are
 going
 to
 grow
 for
 10
 years


20
 years
 and
 there
 a
 post
 on
 Reddit
 I


did
 um
 and
 it
 was
 discussing
 like
 why


companies
 like
 Palantia
 and
 why


companies
 like
 SpaceX
 and
 this
 is
 the


same
 time
 you
 know
 I
 mean
 early
 in
 2020


I
 invested
 in
 SpaceX
 also
 and
 I
 mean


those
 time
 people
 were
 very
 bearish
 on


Tesla
 and
 of
 course
 like
 Palantia
 was
 I


mean
 like
 it
 was
 taboo
 to
 discuss
 and
 in


my
 circle
 nobody
 was
 nobody
 wants
 to


even
 discuss
 about
 it.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 uh
 so
 I
 thought
 I
 mean
 I


had
 some
 feelings
 about
 the
 companies
 I


have
 seen
 their
 their
 performance
 so
 I


thought
 okay
 whom
 should
 I
 discuss
 and


that
 particular
 time
 I
 wasn't


uh
 active
 on
 social
 media
 and
 you
 know


people
 like
 me
 who
 are
 supposed
 to
 go
 in


big
 corporate
 roles
 and
 that
 was
 the
 the


track
 of
 life
 that
 time
 we
 don't
 create


social
 media
 presence
 because
 things
 can


come
 back
 to
 bite
 you
 okay
 So
 uh
 but


>> did
 you
 ever
 did
 you
 ever
 expect
 this
 in


your
 wildest
 dreams
 450
 billion
 in
 in
 3


years?


>> Uh
 not
 in
 3
 years
 to
 be
 honest.
 Okay.
 I


mean
 uh
 and
 especially
 like
 when
 it
 was


$56


I
 think
 that
 particular
 time
 I
 would


have
 taken
 even
 I
 mean
 100
 billion
 in


three
 years.
 Okay.
 Uh
 so
 I
 think
 this
 is


this
 is
 what
 happens.
 I
 think
 this
 is


what
 people
 don't
 realize
 like
 when
 you


are
 in
 a
 good
 company
 so
 you
 remember


like
 when
 the
 the
 chat
 GPD
 happened
 and


AIP
 happened
 so
 I
 mean
 you
 can
 create


opportunities
 for
 you
 if
 you
 give


yourself
 that
 optionality


>> so
 for
 example
 like
 I
 mean
 I'll
 give
 you


a
 very
 simple
 example
 if
 somebody
 is


investing
 in
 S&P
 so
 investing
 in
 S&P
 is


very
 simple
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 do


anything
 you
 just
 keep
 buying
 S&P
 as


much
 as
 possible
 as
 much
 S&P
 grows
 okay


so
 you
 living
 an
 easy
 life
 But
 then
 you


cannot
 expect
 for
 50%
 return.
 So
 it's


it's
 always
 like
 you
 take
 a
 risk
 and
 you


want
 something
 in
 return.
 So
 the
 point


is
 like
 you
 want
 that
 optionality
 then


you
 have
 to
 do
 something
 at
 least
 that


will
 create
 that
 optionality
 for
 you.
 So


in
 the
 case
 of
 Palantier
 they
 had
 this


product
 okay
 they
 were
 of
 course
 there


was
 I
 mean
 lot
 of
 misinformation
 about


it
 but
 anyway
 I
 mean
 those
 things
 were


there
 but
 when
 the
 the
 chat
 GP
 and
 LLM


thing
 happened
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 management


realized
 that
 this
 is
 it
 this
 is
 what
 is


going
 to
 make
 ontology
 operationalize


and
 it
 immediately
 brought
 in
 AIT
 see
 GP


didn't
 happen
 for
 Palantia
 I
 mean
 Chad


GPD
 happened
 for
 everyone
 in
 the


industry
 I
 I
 mean
 snowflake
 was
 there.


Okay.
 I
 mean
 a
 data
 robot
 was
 there.


Everything
 was
 there.
 I
 mean
 all
 these


UI
 path
 no
 one
 was
 able
 to
 respond
 as


fast
 as
 this.


>> Yeah.
 And
 you
 know
 what
 happened
 that


particular
 time
 is
 that
 so
 I
 mean
 they


were
 able
 to
 solve
 complex
 problem


before
 like
 I
 told
 you
 like
 I
 was
 in
 a


meeting
 with
 with
 Palanteer
 guys
 and
 we


were
 discussing
 about
 some
 point
 Airbus


and
 they
 mentioned
 that
 I
 mean
 like
 some


of
 the
 guys
 mentioned
 like
 the
 Airbus


the
 product
 they
 build
 that
 their


internal
 valuation
 Airbus
 like
 valuation


was
 $18
 billion.
 How
 many
 companies
 can


say
 that
 that
 they
 created
 a
 product
 for


a
 company
 and
 that
 product
 is
 18


billion.
 18
 million
 is
 a
 is
 a
 quite
 a


sizable
 company
 that
 can
 be
 included
 in


S&P.
 So
 but
 when
 the
 AIP
 thing
 happened,


AIP
 actually


helped
 them
 in
 sorting
 their
 biggest


trouble.
 The
 biggest
 issue
 was
 sales


those
 days.
 If
 you
 remember,
 we
 used
 to


discuss
 they
 need
 to
 beef
 up
 the
 sales


team.
 But
 this
 whole
 idea
 like
 how
 to


bring
 like
 how
 do
 you
 make
 companies


feel
 and
 touch
 the
 product?
 Okay.


uh
 and
 even
 like
 during
 that
 time
 I
 know


like
 I
 mean
 I
 was
 working
 and
 uh
 I
 was


also
 trying
 to
 arrange
 the
 a
 workshop


with
 with
 my
 company
 uh
 those
 days.


So
 that
 that
 kind
 of
 trickled
 and


suddenly
 like
 what
 happened
 like
 when


people
 came
 forward
 and
 people
 said
 okay


yes
 I
 mean
 we
 solved
 this
 uh
 in
 this


much
 time
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 say
 it's
 not


possible
 it's
 not
 possible
 it's


consulting
 and
 I
 used
 to
 work
 for
 an
 MBB


consulting
 I
 know
 what
 a
 consulting


company
 is
 nobody
 can
 come
 and
 tell
 me


before
 that
 I
 used
 to
 work
 for
 Shambaj
 I


mean
 I
 know
 what
 the
 technology


consulting
 is
 I
 led
 the
 digital
 and
 data


strategy
 for
 a
 company
 like
 Shambajar
 so


I
 know
 like
 I
 I
 know
 the
 players
 I
 know


all
 these
 players
 like


>> that
 that that
 was
 the
 biggest
 concern


back
 then
 right
 that
 it
 was
 a
 consulting


company
 there
 wasn't
 really
 tech
 the


margins
 aren't
 there
 and
 I
 mean
 those


concerns
 look
 so
 silly
 three
 years
 later


>> no
 I
 mean
 like
 I
 mean
 in
 2021
 my


especially
 Q4
 my
 day
 involved
 meeting


with
 people
 in
 companies


um
 I
 mean
 you
 named
 the
 company
 you
 name


the
 company
 like
 Cognite
 snowflake
 uh


Palanteer
 data
 robot
 data
 I
 was
 meeting


these
 guys
 and
 I
 was
 also
 I
 mean
 so
 so
 I


had
 a
 very
 good
 idea
 like
 well
 I
 know


from
 my
 customer
 side
 what
 my
 customers


are
 trying
 to
 solve
 I
 knew
 from
 my


company
 side
 like
 what
 are
 my
 additional


products
 that
 how
 I
 want
 to
 enable
 them


and
 where
 where
 is
 the
 the
 gap
 in
 the


solution
 so
 I
 was
 able
 to
 figure
 it
 out


that
 this
 is
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 the


the
 best
 solution
 to
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 I


mean
 I
 mean
 I
 wasn't
 an
 investor
 I
 was
 a


tech
 I
 was
 a
 technical
 guy


>> technical
 guy
 who
 was
 very
 sound
 in
 what


he
 used
 to
 do
 and
 somehow
 able
 to
 grow


up
 in
 in
 corporate
 ladder.
 So,
 but
 I
 was


still
 like
 that
 problem
 solving
 for


person.
 So,
 I
 was
 thinking
 it
 from
 that


point
 of
 view.


>> Let
 me
 let
 me
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 this


question.
 Would
 you
 would
 you
 sell


Palanteer
 at
 these
 levels?


Um


I
 mean
 like
 at
 this
 point
 in
 this
 uh


momentum
 whatever
 position
 I
 have
 you


know
 I
 mean
 a
 portion
 of
 my
 position
 was


called
 off
 because
 of
 covered
 calls
 I


had
 uh
 but
 uh
 whatever
 I
 mean
 as
 a
 good


size
 position
 is
 still
 remaining
 I
 mean


I
 don't
 see
 I
 mean
 there
 is
 no
 point


selling
 it
 right
 now.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 So,
 so,
 so
 the
 valuation


uh
 push
 back
 would
 be
 that
 it's
 it's


aggressive
 and
 I
 you
 know
 numbers
 really


well
 so
 you
 know
 it's
 aggressive
 but
 are


you
 saying
 that
 the
 the
 the


differentiated
 moat
 that
 they
 have


across
 all
 of
 software
 is
 just
 a
 better


reason
 than
 worrying
 about
 the
 valuation


at
 the
 moment.
 So
 let
 me
 put
 it
 this
 way


like
 the
 day
 a
 CEO
 of
 a
 $50
 billion


company
 stand
 up
 and
 say
 that
 we
 solved


a
 problem
 using
 snowflake
 or
 data
 robots


or
 data
 eco
 uh
 within
 uh
 6
 hours
 which


used
 to
 take
 us
 6
 weeks
 or
 6
 months
 and


we
 created
 a
 value
 more
 than
 500
 million


a
 billion
 I
 probably
 sell
 I
 will
 say
 at


that
 particular
 time
 there
 is
 no


company.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 And
 and
 you
 know
 I
 mean
 like
 a
 lot


of
 people
 know
 like
 I
 mean
 there
 was
 a


time
 like
 I
 was
 pushing
 to
 acquire
 a


company
 which
 had
 some
 product
 called


like
 you
 can
 call
 it
 knowledger
 graph
 or


ontology.
 So
 I
 went
 really
 deep
 into


that
 like
 what
 kind
 what
 it
 takes
 to


build
 this
 kind
 of
 products.
 Even
 our


own
 company
 has
 a
 team
 in
 team
 in


Stanford
 that
 was
 sitting
 and
 they
 were


building
 something
 like
 that.
 Uh


I
 mean
 uh
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 call
 it
 was
 a


joke
 but
 they
 have
 been
 doing
 it
 for


years
 and
 nobody
 has
 seen
 I
 mean
 any


part
 of
 it
 it
 hasn't
 seen
 the
 light
 of


the
 day.
 So
 you
 can
 imagine
 like
 these


things
 are
 uh
 are
 way
 more
 complex
 and


you
 know
 it's
 not
 about
 like
 complexity


it's
 about
 momentum
 it's
 about
 I
 think


the
 focus
 Paluntier
 has
 is
 not


technology
 the
 focus
 Palier
 has
 is
 how


to
 solve
 the
 problem
 and
 so
 and
 they


focus
 on
 the
 problems
 which
 current


technologies
 cannot
 solve
 and
 then
 they


say
 okay
 how
 to
 build
 technology
 for


that
 so
 so
 you
 remember
 like
 when
 when


when
 I
 mean
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 will


not
 remember
 it
 because
 it's
 quite
 old


when
 uh
 Steve
 Jobs
 came
 back
 in
 Apple


and
 there
 is
 a
 very
 famous
 round
 table


and
 people
 are
 very
 condescending
 to
 him


okay
 u
 and
 that
 particular
 time
 like


Steve
 Jobs
 said
 something
 he
 said
 that
 I


mean
 it's
 it's
 okay
 I
 mean
 yeah
 you
 can


build
 a
 piece
 of
 technology
 and
 it
 could


be
 very
 good
 or
 I
 mean
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 you
 want
 to
 build
 a
 technology


and
 then
 figuring
 it
 out
 how
 to
 sell
 it


to
 person
 or
 you
 want
 to
 go
 to
 the


person
 and
 want
 to
 understand
 like
 what


is
 the
 problem
 how
 I
 want
 to
 solve
 it


what
 kind
 of
 product
 and
 then
 build


technology
 backwards.


Okay.
 So
 in
 a
 way
 like
 this
 is
 what
 they


did.
 They
 didn't
 I
 mean
 like
 you
 go
 back


to
 the
 origin
 of
 the
 company
 they
 said


okay
 what
 happened
 and
 you
 know
 despite


all
 the
 conspiracy
 theories
 and


everything
 like
 the
 the
 basic
 idea
 was


very
 simple.
 They
 said
 and
 as
 per
 the


the
 official
 version
 of
 911
 everybody


said
 that
 there
 were
 informations
 and


data
 available
 in
 different
 systems
 and


nobody
 was
 able
 to
 match
 it
 to
 figure
 it


out
 about
 the
 911
 attack
 but
 that
 was


the
 official
 conclusion
 of
 the
 911
 uh


whatever
 investigative
 team
 has
 learned


>> right


>> so
 that
 was
 the
 starting
 point
 like
 how


do
 we
 figure
 out
 how
 do
 we
 find
 a
 system


that
 can
 swing
 through
 uh
 all
 the
 set
 of


data
 while
 protecting
 all
 the
 the
 the


the
 liberties
 and
 uh
 it
 should
 not
 be


like
 become
 a
 tool
 to
 to
 to


punish
 people
 in
 a
 in
 a
 bad
 way.
 Yeah.


No
 I I


>> Yeah.


>> I
 was
 so
 the
 idea
 was
 very
 simple
 this


is
 a
 problem
 and
 this
 current
 technology


cannot
 solve
 this
 problem.
 So
 what
 kind


of
 technology
 will
 required?


>> Yeah.
 No,
 and
 it
 ended
 up
 being
 Palenter


and
 and
 obviously
 we've
 seen
 that
 in
 the


growth
 use
 cases
 over
 the
 past
 couple


years
 which
 I
 also
 think
 was
 also
 very


important.
 Such
 I
 don't want
 to
 keep
 you


too
 long
 but
 two
 other
 quick
 questions


for
 you
 and
 then
 I'll
 let
 you
 leave.
 Uh


first
 off
 we
 got
 grab
 earnings
 coming


up.
 Any
 quick
 thoughts
 on
 what
 you
 think


we
 can
 expect
 in
 Q3
 for
 that?


>> Um
 no
 man
 I
 mean
 see
 their
 performance


is
 good
 but
 my
 view
 is
 Grab
 probably


will
 be
 a
 slow
 burn.
 Okay.
 Grab
 is
 is


not
 a
 US
 company.
 So
 the
 US
 catalyst


don't
 apply
 here.
 People
 need
 to


understand
 that
 part.
 It's
 a
 southeast.


It's
 a
 very
 strong
 company.
 It
 has
 a
 lot


of
 cash.
 It's
 growing
 very
 good.
 I
 mean


I'm
 a
 grad
 user.
 I
 know.
 I
 mean
 like


this
 is
 probably
 the
 only
 company
 in
 my


in
 my
 uh
 portfolio
 for
 which
 which
 I'm
 a


user.
 Okay.
 So
 uh
 the
 thing
 what
 happen


is
 like
 when
 this
 company
 but
 when
 you


have
 such
 a
 strong
 company
 they
 can
 make


massive
 strategic
 moves
 and
 that
 is


where
 I
 think
 the
 major
 major
 push
 will


come.
 So
 for
 example
 say
 uh
 tomorrow
 uh


say
 for
 example
 say
 Clara
 want
 to
 go


into
 Southeast
 Asia.
 Clara
 doesn't
 have


license.
 So
 Clara
 can
 go
 and


>> pounder.
 Last
 question
 for
 you
 is


PayPal.
 So
 you
 took
 a
 position
 in
 it
 had


a
 big
 day
 yesterday
 kind
 of
 giving
 back


some
 of
 the
 gains.
 Are
 you
 doubling
 down


here
 or
 what
 would
 you
 do
 from


>> I
 have
 already
 doubled
 down.
 I
 mean
 I


already
 posted
 that
 I
 already
 increased


my
 position
 and
 this
 is
 probably
 the


largest
 league
 position
 I
 have
 ever


taken.


Okay,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 it's
 bigger
 than
 my


SOFI
 and
 AMD
 initial
 position.
 Okay,
 so


the
 idea
 is
 very
 simple.
 See,
 okay.
 Um,


so
 there
 there
 is
 a
 fundamental
 view
 and


there
 is
 a
 technical.
 So
 let
 me
 explain


the
 technical
 view
 first,
 which
 is


simpler.
 I
 mean,
 so
 for
 example,
 if
 you


see
 where
 the
 the
 label
 of
 PayPal
 is


PayPal
 is
 just
 closed
 above
 its
 200


moving
 average,
 which
 hasn't
 happened


for
 a
 long
 time.
 If
 you
 see
 all
 the


I
 mean
 moving
 average
 very
 close
 to


golden
 cross
 or
 silver
 cross
 where
 you


want
 to
 look
 at
 it
 and
 it's
 at
 the
 level


like
 69
 and
 above.
 Now
 when
 you
 look
 at


the
 weekly
 moving
 average
 they
 are
 just


double
 in
 the
 history
 of
 PayPal
 in
 the


history
 of
 PayPal
 all
 of
 these
 six


averages
 has
 never
 came
 under
 a
 $10


range.
 They
 are
 currently
 in
 a
 $6
 range.


It
 has
 never
 happened.
 So
 think
 about
 a


spring
 which
 is
 there's
 a
 pressure
 from


top
 there's
 a
 pressure
 from
 bottom.
 So


what
 will
 happen
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day?


Inertia
 will
 make
 it
 break
 either
 on
 the


top
 side
 or
 on
 the
 bottom
 side.
 No.


Okay.
 Uh
 this
 is
 where
 the
 fundamental


part
 come.
 Fundamental
 part
 is
 now


currently
 PS
 for
 this
 company
 is
 two.


The
 PE
 is
 40.
 It
 has
 never
 been
 this


low.
 The
 company
 the
 growth
 is
 not
 like


super
 30%
 or
 40%
 like
 Sofi
 and
 Hood
 can


get
 but
 it
 is
 decent
 growth.
 They
 are


buying
 by
 the
 stocks
 like
 crazy.
 It's


undervalued.
 There
 is
 no
 question
 about


it.
 It
 has
 been
 become
 the
 first
 uh
 uh


wallet
 with
 JBD
 which
 is
 the
 biggest
 or


the
 most
 uh
 exclusive
 pixie
 dust
 that


you
 can
 find
 in
 in
 in
 these
 waters


nowadays.
 Okay.
 So
 for
 example,
 let's


say
 it
 breaks
 below
 at
 this
 level.
 Okay.


Uh
 so
 what
 I
 mean
 it
 might
 go
 to
 50
 but


it
 come
 back
 to
 these
 levels.
 Eventually


it
 has
 to
 break
 up.


And
 if
 you
 see
 like
 this
 base
 that
 we


are
 talking
 about
 like
 this
 60
 or
 50
 to


90
 I
 mean
 this
 base
 is
 now
 over
 3
 years


we
 all
 know
 what
 happens
 when
 a
 base
 is


this
 long
 company
 is
 performing
 I
 mean


yeah
 I
 mean
 we
 are
 going
 to
 see
 serious


move
 at
 some
 point
 in
 this
 okay
 uh
 so


it's
 an
 asymmetric
 back
 in
 my
 opinion
 at


this
 particular
 time
 okay
 I
 mean
 my


downside
 is
 that
 uh
 if
 it
 doesn't
 move
 I


will
 eventually
 like
 in
 next
 seven
 8


months
 Once
 I
 will
 get
 I
 mean
 a
 decent


exit.
 Okay,
 my
 my
 average
 point
 for


example
 like
 the
 leak
 is
 $8.3


uh
 for
 me
 like
 I
 mean
 I
 will
 get
 an
 exit


if
 I
 find
 that
 it's
 really
 not
 moving


somewhere
 around
 seven
 or
 7.5.
 So
 and
 if


it
 moves


I
 mean
 let's
 see
 I
 mean
 it
 can
 really
 go


goes
 I
 mean
 seriously
 up.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 And
 I
 I
 also
 think
 the


downside
 is
 limited
 at
 this
 point.
 Maybe


you
 know
 you
 have
 to
 wait
 until
 it


actually
 makes
 that
 move
 but


>> it
 does
 feel
 like
 the
 downside
 is
 and
 I


it
 feels
 like
 you've
 caught
 more
 of
 a


bottom
 here


>> which
 is
 a
 good
 thing.
 I
 mean
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 see
 eventually
 what
 will
 happen


like
 uh
 when
 market
 breaks
 everyone
 goes


for
 these
 kind
 of
 companies
 which
 are


slightly
 undervalued
 bit
 on
 safer
 side


even
 if
 they
 go
 down
 they
 don't
 go
 down


rel
 I
 mean
 like
 so
 far
 inhood
 will
 go


down
 more
 relative
 to
 companies
 they


they
 they
 move
 they
 they
 are
 high
 beta


company
 they
 move
 uh
 higher
 in
 both


directions
 that's
 the
 reality
 but
 when


you
 get
 to
 a
 point
 where
 you
 realize


that
 the
 the
 possibility
 of
 downside


side
 and
 a
 possibility
 of
 decent
 exit


uh
 exist
 for
 you
 in
 case
 thesis
 don't


work
 or
 stock
 doesn't
 react.
 I
 mean
 this


is
 where
 I
 always
 take
 large
 size.
 I


mean
 this
 is
 where
 I
 took
 large
 size


Valentia.
 I
 took
 large
 size
 with
 AMD.
 I


took
 large
 size
 with
 SoFi.
 I
 mean
 uh
 I


mean
 if
 you
 don't
 take
 large
 size
 then


then
 when
 do
 you
 take
 I
 mean
 large
 size.


Well,
 that
 that's
 the
 one
 thing
 I've


learned
 from
 you
 over
 the
 past
 couple


years
 as
 well
 is
 like
 if
 you're
 gonna


have
 conviction,
 you
 might
 be
 right,
 you


might
 be
 wrong,
 but
 if
 you're
 right,
 you


should
 really
 enjoy
 being
 right,
 you


know?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 uh
 so
 same
 thing
 like
 I


mean
 like
 when
 uh
 uh
 you
 remember
 the


sofi
 discussion
 we
 had
 like
 in
 April,
 I


mean
 like
 once
 we
 knew
 that
 okay


liberation
 day
 issues
 are
 sorted
 out
 so


far
 is
 back
 to
 13.
 So
 that
 particular


point
 calculating
 the
 probability
 it


will
 be
 above
 20
 by
 the
 year
 end
 was
 was


quite
 decent.
 I
 mean
 it
 could
 reach
 to


2122
 because
 I
 mean
 the
 performance
 was


still
 coming
 strong.
 So
 at
 that


particular
 time
 buying
 the
 January
 calls


at
 83
 cent
 was
 a
 clear
 asymmetric
 bet


that
 means
 even
 if
 it
 goes
 to
 22
 you


still
 make
 I
 mean
 more
 than
 100%.
 So
 now


I
 mean
 it
 is
 31
 32.


Okay,
 the
 calls
 which
 I
 bought
 on
 83


cents
 and
 I
 haven't
 sort
 of
 sold
 yet
 a


single
 call.
 I
 mean
 uh
 those
 calls
 are
 I


don't
 know
 like
 today
 I
 was
 seeing
 were


like
 12
 $13


and
 I'm
 still
 not
 selling
 I
 still
 have


couple
 of
 months
 to
 ride
 on
 that
 okay


with
 rate
 cuts
 and
 with
 all
 discussion


of
 S&P
 inclusion
 and
 funny
 thing
 is
 the


because
 it
 was
 such
 a
 good
 stock
 I
 mean


all
 of
 this
 money
 all
 the
 I
 mean
 the
 the


initial
 capital
 came
 from
 selling
 cash


secured
 put
 so
 this
 is
 practically
 a


free
 position
 for
 me.


Yeah,
 it
 makes
 sense.
 It
 makes
 sense.


Suchin,
 there's
 his
 Twitter
 right
 there


in
 the
 chat.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.


Thank
 you
 for
 being
 a
 great
 part
 of
 the


community.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of
 us


appreciate
 all
 the
 insights
 you've


given,
 especially
 on
 pound
 share
 over


the
 past
 couple
 years.
 And,
 you
 know,


deeply
 means
 a
 lot.


>> There's
 one
 one
 more
 thing
 I
 want
 to


tell
 Amit.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 I
 I'm
 more


keen
 about
 my
 AMD
 position
 going
 into


things
 and
 I
 wrote
 an
 article
 also
 like


because
 to
 me
 like
 this
 is
 a
 bit
 tricky.


Yes,
 the
 stock
 has
 run
 and
 there
 is
 lot


of
 upside
 and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 revenue


has
 to
 come
 but
 it
 will
 all
 come
 next


year
 and
 year
 after.
 So
 what
 happens
 the


AMD
 has
 to
 deliver
 the
 triple
 beat
 and


AMD
 has
 to
 raise
 their
 guidance
 like
 mad


like
 Oracle
 raised
 their
 guidance


something
 like
 that


>> agreed


>> if
 they
 don't
 do
 it
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 at


least
 for
 now
 they
 I
 I
 believe
 it
 will


tank


>> I
 agree
 100%.


100%
 but
 but
 they
 have
 this
 open
 air


partnership
 you'd
 imagine
 they
 do


increase
 that
 fiscal
 year
 26
 guidance


but


>> I
 mean
 they
 have
 to
 and
 Lisa
 is
 a
 smart


CEO
 I
 mean
 she
 knows
 what's
 at
 stake


here
 because
 you
 cannot
 once
 you
 lose


the
 confidence
 of
 investors
 I
 mean
 for


example
 just
 imagine
 I
 mean
 Nvidia


delivers
 a
 solid
 earnings
 and
 Nvidia


goes
 to
 230
 240
 and
 they
 mass
 up
 and


they
 go
 to
 for
 example
 say
 220
 210
 but


investors
 will
 think
 now
 I
 would
 prefer


to
 be
 in
 Nvidia
 than
 AMD


So
 she
 has
 to
 maintain
 the
 moment
 and


it's
 pretty
 simple.
 You
 have
 such
 large


deal
 with
 open
 AI,
 you
 have
 such
 large


deal
 with
 uh
 with
 Oracle.
 Why
 not
 raise


guidance
 like
 a
 like
 a
 madman?


Okay.
 So
 I
 I
 I'm
 still
 trying
 to
 figure


it
 out
 and
 this
 is
 where
 I'm
 up
 so
 late


is
 like
 how
 to
 h
 this
 position
 because


this
 is
 quite
 big
 for
 me.
 I
 mean
 it's


quite
 a
 big
 position
 and
 I
 mean
 uh
 at


this
 point
 it's
 already
 a
 10x
 for
 me.


>> Wow.
 Congrats.


>> Okay.


>> Incredible.


>> I
 mean
 because
 I
 sold
 a
 piece
 of
 portion


of
 this
 when
 it
 3x
 then
 then
 it
 tanked


again
 then
 I
 bought
 again.
 So


practically
 the
 calls
 I
 have
 they're


effectively
 $6.1
 for
 me
 and
 those
 calls


are
 nowadays
 like
 86
 $88.
 So
 it's
 close


to
 get
 15x
 and
 I
 mean
 I
 haven't
 sold
 a


single
 thing.


>> No.


>> So
 that
 that
 position
 I'm
 more
 more
 keen


like
 what
 to
 do
 in
 next
 3
 4
 days
 how
 to


hedge
 it.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 exit
 it
 but
 I


just
 want
 to
 hedge
 it
 one
 way
 or
 other


way.


>> All
 right.
 Thank
 you
 Sachin.
 Appreciate


it.
 His
 link
 in
 the
 chat.
 You
 can
 follow


his
 Twitter
 his
 articles.
 Thank
 you


Sachin
 for
 hopping
 on.
 Really
 appreciate


it.


>> Thanks
 man.
 You
 take
 care
 man.


>> Y
 happy
 birthday.


>> Thank
 you.
 Appreciate
 it.
 Talk
 later.


>> Thank


>> 10x
 on
 AMD.


So
 I
 think
 Satchin's
 up
 like
 200%
 year


to
 date.
 Um
 AMD,
 SoFi,
 and
 Palunteer


really
 helping
 that.


Uh
 but
 yeah,
 for
 those
 that
 I
 think


there
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 glitch
 for


10
 seconds
 with
 YouTube,
 but
 he
 said


he's
 super
 bullish
 PayPal
 and
 he's


doubling
 down
 on
 PayPal.
 He's
 doubling


down
 on
 PayPal
 here
 and
 he
 thinks
 it
 is


more
 asymmetric.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 agree


with
 them.
 It's
 definitely
 asymmetric.


The
 question
 is,
 will
 you
 have
 the


upside
 to
 the
 asymmetry?
 But
 look,
 are


they
 going
 to
 take
 PayPal
 down
 to
 50?


Like,
 it
 it
 does
 really
 feel
 like
 the


downside
 shouldn't
 be
 as
 aggressive
 as


what
 the
 upside
 could
 be.


But
 the
 question
 is
 just
 can
 they
 change


their
 narrative
 and
 really
 get
 that


growth?
 uh
 update
 on
 mortgage
 rates
 that


we
 talked
 about
 in
 the
 morning,
 lowest


since
 September
 2024.


>> Now
 joins
 us
 with
 the
 numbers
 and
 what


exactly
 is
 going
 to
 drive
 some
 of
 that


home
 buying
 sentiment.
 Diana,


>> well
 Dom,
 let's
 start
 with
 interest


rates.
 Now,
 the
 average
 on
 the
 30-year


fix
 dropped
 last
 week,
 as
 you
 said,
 to


the
 lowest
 level
 since
 September
 of
 last


year.
 That's
 on
 the
 Mortgage
 Bankers


Association's
 weekly
 report.
 It
 moved


even
 lower
 to
 start
 this
 week
 on
 a


separate
 read
 from
 Mortgage
 News
 Daily.


Now,
 as
 a
 result,
 applications
 to


refinance
 a
 home
 loan
 last
 week
 jumped


9%
 for
 the
 week
 and
 were
 a
 whopping
 111%


higher
 than
 the
 same
 week
 one
 year
 ago.


That
 is
 correct.
 Rates
 were
 higher
 last


year,
 but
 only
 by
 43
 basis
 points
 when


you
 compare
 that
 exact
 week.
 Demand
 from


home
 buyers
 moved
 up
 a
 little
 bit,
 but


buyers
 have
 not
 been
 nearly
 impressed
 by


these
 lower
 rates.
 And
 you
 see
 that
 in


the
 latest
 pending
 home
 sales
 index
 out


this
 morning.
 Sales
 in
 September
 were


unchanged
 from
 August
 and
 dropped
 0.9%


year-over-year
 according
 to
 the
 National


Association
 of
 Realtors.


>> We're
 going
 to
 need
 to
 get
 lower
 than


six.
 We're
 going
 to
 need
 to
 get
 lower


than
 six,
 I
 think,
 to
 get
 Yeah,
 as
 a
 lot


of
 you
 guys
 are
 saying,
 too
 early
 to


refi.


5.9,
 6.05,
 6.3
 is
 not
 cutting
 it.
 Like,


I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 enough
 to
 get


people
 excited.
 And
 that's
 why
 we
 need


the
 rate
 cuts
 today.
 Now,
 hopefully


those
 rate
 cuts
 end
 up
 leading
 to
 the


10-year
 falling
 and
 that
 could
 help


mortgage
 rates.
 10,
 you're
 back
 above


four.


Got
 JPound
 30
 minutes
 or
 at least
 the


announcement
 in
 30
 minutes.
 Then
 we'll


get
 FC
 at
 230,
 but
 um
 the
 the
 cut
 is


going
 to
 be
 vital
 to
 hopefully
 get


30-year
 mortgages
 to
 start
 coming
 down.


Decision
 is
 in
 30
 minutes.
 In
 30


minutes,
 we
 will
 get
 the
 decision.


Dude,
 did
 you
 guys
 see
 that
 tweet
 from


Barbell
 Financial?
 He
 freaking


rage
 baited
 the
 entire
 platform
 of


Twitter.
 Um,
 look
 at
 this.
 It's
 got


eight
 million
 views,
 bro.
 He
 said,
 "I


just
 paid
 off
 my
 mortgage.


The
 only
 good
 mortgage
 is
 a
 paid
 off


one.
 Our
 biggest
 monthly
 expense
 is


gone."


The
 rate
 2.625%.


2.625%.


For
 context,
 a
 money
 market
 fund
 is


giving
 you
 almost
 70%
 above
 that
 rate
 if


you
 just
 put
 your
 cash
 there.


I
 was
 just
 like,
 bro,
 he
 rage
 baited


everybody.


Everybody.
 And
 then
 this
 is
 his
 next


comment
 after
 it.
 He
 said,
 um,


he
 said,
 what
 did
 he
 say?
 He
 said,
 "To


all
 the
 idiots,
 to
 all
 the
 people
 saying


I'm
 an
 idiot
 for
 paying
 off
 my
 house
 and


being
 truly
 debt
 free,
 maybe
 you
 are


just
 having
 a
 bad
 day,
 but
 better
 days


are
 right
 ahead
 of
 you.
 Your
 rent
 and


mortgage
 payments
 are
 coming
 to
 in
 four


days."
 Like,
 this
 dude
 is
 just
 having


fun
 with
 it.
 He
 doesn't
 care.


There's
 two
 sides
 to
 this,
 right?
 The


first
 side
 is
 that
 you
 get
 the
 peace
 of


mind
 of
 paying
 off
 some
 of
 your
 debt,


which
 is
 like,
 you
 know,
 like
 like


what's
 the
 price
 on
 peace
 of
 mind?
 Now,


one
 could
 argue,
 well,
 the
 price
 is


3.75%
 in
 a
 money
 market
 fund.
 But,
 uh,


that
 peace
 of
 mind
 sometimes
 is


invaluable
 to
 people
 that
 just
 don't


want
 to
 deal
 with
 the
 debt
 payment.
 The


other
 argument
 is,
 wait
 a
 second,
 if


you're,
 you
 know,
 getting
 a
 very
 low


rate
 to
 finance
 your
 capital
 or
 to


finance
 your
 purchases,
 then
 the


opportunity
 cost
 of
 your
 capital
 is


significantly
 more
 valuable
 than
 than


the
 cash
 that
 you
 would
 use
 to
 pay
 it


off.
 So,
 like
 my
 Tesla
 has
 0%
 APY.


just
 wouldn't
 make
 sense
 to
 pay
 off
 the


remaining
 $22,000


when
 like
 I'm
 not
 having
 to
 pay
 any


interest
 on
 it.
 That
 $500
 a
 month
 that


you're
 paying
 on.
 It's
 like,
 okay,


that's
 that's
 it.
 That's
 all
 you
 have
 to


like
 there's
 no
 necessity
 to
 be
 like,


let
 me
 just
 pay
 this
 off.
 Unless
 I


mentally
 wanted
 to
 feel
 better
 that
 I


paid
 off
 my
 Tesla.


But
 outside
 of
 that,
 it's
 like
 any


excess
 cash
 not
 going
 into
 Tesla
 can
 be


making
 way
 more
 than
 0%.


Because
 the
 interest
 is
 0%.


Now,
 with
 a
 home
 at
 2.65,
 you
 can
 still


get
 a
 lot
 more
 above
 that,
 but
 his


argument
 was
 more
 so
 about
 peace
 than


anything,


or
 at least
 mental
 peace.


Let
 me
 let
 me
 do
 a
 poll.
 How
 many
 people


would
 agree
 with
 that?
 70%
 of
 you
 say


pump
 after
 the
 FOMC,
 by
 the
 way.
 So,
 we


got
 a
 decent
 amount
 of
 people
 saying


we're
 going
 higher,
 which
 I
 think
 we


are,
 but
 I'm
 also
 like,
 dude,
 we're
 at


alltime
 highs.
 I
 wonder
 if
 the
 market


gives
 us
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 rug.


if
 it's
 already
 baked
 in.
 Would
 you
 pay


off
 a
 2.6%
 mortgage
 early?


I
 feel
 like
 most
 people
 will
 say
 no.


Amit,
 are
 you
 here
 the
 whole
 day?
 Yes.


This
 is
 the
 first
 all
 day
 stream
 we've


done
 in
 a
 while.


Last
 time
 we
 did
 this
 was
 May
 and
 it
 was


similar
 around
 this
 time.
 We
 had
 a
 lot


of
 earnings
 coming
 up
 so
 we
 just
 stayed


live
 but
 doing
 the
 same
 today.
 Dude,
 we


did
 this
 also
 that
 remember
 PayPal


earnings
 back
 in
 uh
 February
 2024.
 We


stayed
 live
 the
 whole
 day
 for
 that
 as


well


and
 I
 think
 we
 had
 pounder
 in
 the
 night,


but
 it
 was
 a
 long
 day.
 So,
 we've
 done
 it


a
 couple
 times.


We're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 couple
 Jose
 will


join
 in
 a
 bit
 um
 for
 earnings.
 I
 think


Sam
 is
 gonna
 join.
 So


once
 we
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 FOMC
 and
 all


this
 stuff,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 what


happens.
 Uh
 68%
 said
 no.
 So
 still
 30%


say
 yes,
 you
 would
 pay
 it
 off
 early.


Can
 you
 recap
 the
 morning
 stories?
 Yeah,


I
 mean
 we
 didn't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 crazy


stuff
 happen
 in
 the
 morning.
 We
 talked


about
 China.
 Trump
 had
 some
 really
 good


updates
 on
 potentially
 giving
 the


Blackwell
 to
 Xi
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 having
 a


better
 deal
 with
 China.
 So
 that
 was


bullish
 for
 Nvidia.
 Nvidia
 obviously


popped
 to
 an
 all-time
 high
 of
 212
 pound


got
 to
 198.
 Um
 China
 bought
 more


soybeans
 which
 was
 also
 bullish


180,000
 tons
 from
 the
 United
 States
 sign


of
 goodwill.
 Amazon
 opened
 up
 an
 11


billion
 data
 center
 in


Indiana
 from
 a
 cornfield
 and
 they
 also


expanded
 their
 partnership
 with
 uh


Anthropic.
 Nvidia
 got
 upgraded
 to
 275


from
 Bank
 of
 America.


And
 then
 on
 some
 of
 these
 macro
 charts,


zero
 DTE
 options,
 1.2
 million
 a
 day


retail
 is
 now
 trading,
 which
 is
 quite


incredible
 for
 the
 options
 volatility.


Uh
 this
 is
 all
 the
 stuff
 Nvidia's
 done


over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 days.
 Samsung


partnership,
 Hyundai
 partnership,
 Crowd


Strike,
 Uber,
 Palunteer,
 billion
 dollar


investment
 in
 Nokia,
 seven
 new


partnerships
 or
 seven
 new
 supercomputers


with
 US
 government,
 US
 partnership
 uh
 or


partnership
 with
 US
 DOE
 and
 500
 billion


in
 expected
 business
 over
 the
 next
 five


quarters.
 And
 then
 Google
 got
 to
 a


lovely
 all-time
 high,


which
 is
 also
 nice
 to
 see.
 Wow.
 27240


on
 the
 Googs.


27240
 on
 the
 Googs.


I
 love
 being
 debtree
 on
 my
 house
 and
 an


extra
 3500
 a
 month.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 that's


the
 bullcase
 of
 it.
 Obviously
 the


argument
 is
 you
 can
 still
 make
 that


money
 without
 having
 to
 completely
 be


debtree.
 But
 again,
 it
 really
 comes
 down


to
 psychologically
 just
 how
 do
 you
 want


to
 navigate?
 I
 mean,
 I've
 definitely


paid
 off
 stuff
 early,
 like
 just
 because


I
 don't
 want
 to
 deal
 with
 having
 to
 log


in
 every
 month
 and
 actually
 making
 the


payment
 and
 it
 just
 feels
 better
 to
 be


off,
 but
 like
 on
 the
 bigger
 purchases,


it's
 more
 like,
 okay,
 there's
 no
 need
 to


pay
 that
 much
 early.


So,
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 a
 a
 preference


right
 here.
 BMR
 50.87
 down
 from
 53.


Peggy
 says,
 "We
 paid
 off
 our
 house
 to


over
 10
 years
 early."


And
 say
 debt
 again.


It's
 debt.


That's
 how
 you
 say
 it.
 There's
 no
 way
 in


hell
 I'm
 saying
 debt
 wrong.


Isn't
 the
 B
 silent
 in
 debt?


There's
 no
 freaking
 way
 I'm
 saying
 it


wrong.


Yeah.
 See,
 look,
 even
 Google
 debt.


>> I
 said
 death.


Well,
 debt
 can
 sometimes
 lead
 to
 death.


I
 guess
 it's
 pronounced
 debit.
 Okay,
 I


could
 have
 really
 trolled
 everybody
 and


said
 debit.
 Oh
 my
 goodness.
 I
 could
 have


trolled
 everyone
 or
 I
 could
 have
 like


really
 stressed
 the
 beat.
 The
 debt.


The
 debt.
 It's
 important
 to
 pay
 off
 the


deba.
 But
 that
 would
 have
 been
 too


obvious,
 dude.
 People
 would
 have
 known


it
 was
 a
 troll
 at
 that
 point.


Would
 have
 been
 too
 obvious.


Way
 too
 obvious.


Way
 too
 obvious.


SoFi
 still
 down
 2.6.


Grabby
 up
 two.
 And
 then
 Wow,
 Google's


pushing,
 bro.
 Like
 really
 pushing.
 27258


on
 the
 Googs.


Why
 do
 we
 think
 it's
 pumping
 before


earnings?


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,


Street's
 expecting
 some
 good
 numbers,


but
 like
 is
 it
 that
 good?


Okay,
 Estee
 Ladar,
 I
 say
 correctly.


Everyone
 just
 wants
 to
 hate
 on
 me.
 Uh


AWS
 again,
 still
 seeing
 outages
 right


here.
 So,
 it's
 not
 looking
 like


Microsoft
 there's
 a
 little
 bit
 of


resolution
 based
 on
 what
 they
 said
 with


Azure.


AWS
 is
 still
 down.


Um
 we
 got
 a
 quote
 from
 Sam
 Alman.
 Sam


Alman's
 OpenAI
 says
 they
 have
 committed


to
 1.4
 4
 trillion
 in
 compute
 costs
 and


would
 like
 to
 do
 much
 more
 depending
 on


revenue
 growth.
 Wow.


Oh
 my.
 Is
 this
 from
 the
 live
 stream
 they


did
 the
 other
 day?
 1.4
 trillion
 in


compute
 costs.


Did
 they
 just
 do
 an
 update?
 Oh,
 they


just
 did
 an
 update
 just
 now.


They
 just
 did
 one.
 Let
 me
 uh


Yeah,
 let
 me
 pull
 this
 up.


Okay.
 And
 then
 I
 want
 to
 go
 on
 to


infrastructure.
 So
 I
 know
 there's
 been
 a


lot
 of
 confusion
 about
 sort
 of
 where
 we


are
 in
 our
 infrastructure
 buildout
 and


we
 figured
 we
 would
 just
 be
 super


transparent
 about
 that.
 So
 where
 we
 are


today
 um
 all
 of
 our
 commitments
 total
 a


little
 bit
 over
 30
 gawatt
 of
 uh
 of


infrastructure
 buildout.
 Um
 and
 that's


about
 a
 $1.4
 trillion
 total
 uh
 financial


obligation
 for
 us
 over
 the
 next
 many


years.
 Um
 this
 is
 what
 we've
 committed


to
 so
 far.
 Are
 we


>> Can
 you
 say
 over
 the
 next
 90
 years?


>> And
 that's
 about
 a
 $1.4
 trillion
 total


uh
 financial
 obligation
 for
 us
 over
 the


next
 many
 years.
 Um
 this


>> No,
 he
 said
 many,
 bro.
 But
 it
 sounded


like
 90,
 right?
 If
 that's
 the
 case,
 all


right,
 I
 guess
 the
 cycle
 is
 going
 to
 go


on
 for
 the
 next
 century
 at
 this
 point.


If
 that's
 what
 we're
 doing,


>> is
 what
 we've
 committed
 to
 so
 far.
 We
 of


course
 hope
 to
 do
 much
 more
 but
 given


the
 picture
 we
 see
 today,
 given
 what
 we


think
 we
 can
 see
 for
 revenue
 growth,
 our


ability
 to
 raise
 capital,
 this
 is
 what


we're
 currently
 comfortable
 with.
 This


requires
 a
 ton
 of
 partnerships.
 We've


talked
 about
 uh
 many
 of
 our
 great
 chip


partners.
 Uh
 there
 are
 people
 building


the
 data
 centers
 for
 us,
 land,
 energy.


Uh
 there
 will
 be
 chip
 fab
 facilities.


This
 is
 already
 getting
 to
 require
 quite


a
 lot
 of
 supply
 chain
 innovation
 and


we're
 thrilled
 to
 get
 to
 work
 with
 uh


AMD,
 Broadcom,
 Google,
 Microsoft,


Nvidia,
 Oracle,
 Soft
 Bank,
 many
 others


to
 really
 make
 this
 happen.
 But
 this
 is


still
 early.
 If
 the
 if
 the
 work
 that


Yakob
 talks
 about
 comes
 to
 fruition,


which
 we
 think
 it
 will,
 and
 if
 the


economic
 value
 of
 these
 things
 um
 happen


and
 people
 want
 to
 use
 all
 these


services,
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 much
 more


than
 this.
 So
 I
 want
 to
 be
 clear,
 we're


not
 committing
 to
 this
 yet,
 but
 we
 are


having
 conversations
 about
 it.
 Our


aspiration
 is
 that
 we
 can
 build
 an


infrastructure
 factory
 where
 we
 can


create
 1
 gawatt
 a
 week
 of
 uh
 compute
 and


we
 aspirationally
 would
 like
 to
 get
 that


cost
 down
 significantly
 um
 to
 like
 $20


billion
 a
 gawatt
 over
 the
 5year
 life


cycle
 of
 uh
 you
 know
 that
 equipment.
 To


do
 this
 will
 require
 a
 ton
 of


innovation,
 a
 ton
 of
 partnerships,


obviously
 a
 lot
 of
 revenue
 growth.
 um


we'll
 have
 to
 repurpose
 our
 thoughts


about
 robotics
 to
 help
 us
 build
 data


centers
 instead
 of
 doing
 all
 the
 other


things.
 Um
 but
 this
 is
 where
 we'd
 like


to
 go
 and
 over
 the
 coming
 months
 we
 are


going
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 to
 see
 if
 we


can
 get
 here.
 Um
 it
 will
 be
 some
 time


before
 we're
 in
 a
 financial
 position


where
 we
 could
 actually
 pull
 the
 trigger


and
 get
 going
 on
 this.
 1
 gawatt
 is
 like


a
 big
 number,
 but
 I
 figured
 we
 would


show
 a
 little
 video
 to
 put
 this
 into


perspective.
 Um
 this
 is
 uh
 a
 data
 center


that
 we're
 building
 in
 Abene,
 Texas.


This
 is
 the
 first
 Stargate
 site.
 We're


doing
 several
 of
 these
 now
 around
 the


country,
 but
 this
 one
 is
 the
 furthest


along.
 There's
 like
 many
 thousands
 of


people
 that
 work
 here
 every
 day
 just


doing
 the
 construction
 at
 the
 site.


There's
 probably
 hundreds
 of
 thousands


or
 millions
 of
 people
 that
 work
 in
 the


supply
 chain
 to
 make
 all
 this
 happen
 to


design
 these
 chips,
 to
 fab
 these
 chips,


to
 put
 them
 together.
 Um
 there,
 you


know,
 there's
 all
 of
 the
 work
 that
 goes


into
 this
 for
 energy.
 There's
 an


enormous
 amount
 of
 stuff
 that
 has
 to


happen
 um
 for
 each
 one
 gigawatt.
 And
 we


want
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 we
 can
 make
 this


way
 more
 efficient
 and
 way
 cheaper
 and


way
 more
 scalable.
 so
 that
 we
 can


deliver
 on
 the
 infrastructure
 that
 the


research
 roadmap
 requires
 and
 that
 all


of
 the
 ways
 that
 people
 will
 want
 to
 use


this
 need


>> 1.4
 4
 trill
 folks
 that
 they've
 committed


to.
 By
 the
 way,
 I
 guess
 Google
 decided


to
 just
 make
 the
 earnings
 move
 before


the
 earnings


273.


Dude,
 could
 you
 imagine
 if
 they
 deliver


a
 good
 quarter
 and
 this
 jumps
 up
 to
 290?


Like,
 it's
 not
 out
 of
 the
 realm
 of


possibility.
 What's
 the
 implied
 move
 on


Google?


Isn't
 it
 like
 5%.


I
 think
 it's
 five,
 right?
 Yeah,
 that


would
 be
 that
 would
 be
 putting
 Google
 to


the
 upside
 at
 around
 287


5.5
 implied.
 Okay,
 so
 that
 yeah,
 that


would
 get
 you
 to
 290
 on
 a
 5
 and a
 half%


move.
 Now,
 a
 5
 and
 a
 half%
 move
 is
 is


still
 aggressive
 for
 a
 company
 of
 their


size,
 but
 if
 they
 really
 blow
 it
 out
 of


the
 park,


who
 knows?


Got
 the
 googs
 at
 200


273.


Uh,
 we
 got
 an
 update
 from
 Marjorie


Taylor
 Green.


What
 has
 she
 bought?


She's
 our
 Nancy,
 right?
 She's
 our
 new


Nancy.


She
 bought
 more
 IBIT.


She
 bought


PaloAlto
 Network,


IBIT,
 and
 Amjit.


PaloAlto
 Network.
 I
 bid
 in
 Amjen.


She
 also
 bought
 Palenter
 back
 in


January.


Such
 says
 Google
 generates
 the
 most
 free


cash
 flow
 in
 the
 whole
 world.
 Yeah.
 And


they
 might
 get
 heavily
 rewarded
 for
 that


today
 as
 well
 if
 they
 can
 continue
 that.


Okay.
 So,
 Bitcoin,
 Amgen,
 and
 PaloAlto


Networks.
 That's
 what
 NY's
 buying.


All right.
 Or
 not
 Nancy,
 sorry,
 Marjorie


Taylor
 Green.


Um


it
 is
 nice
 to
 see
 them
 buy
 a
 little
 bit


of
 biddy
 given
 Bitcoin's
 been
 kind
 of


stuck
 but
 Bitcoin
 down
 on
 the
 day.


Nvidia
 still
 207
 and
 then
 Tesla
 461.


Palanter
 going
 back
 for
 198.
 She's


trying
 198.40


19772.


June
 says
 I
 just
 sold
 Amjen.


Where
 is
 Amjen?
 We
 even
 looked
 into
 this


the
 other
 day.


This
 stock
 I
 think
 is
 up
 for
 the
 year.


Amgen
 yeah
 12%.


So
 going
 back
 to
 Sam
 Alman
 again
 1.4


trillion
 in
 commitments
 is
 is
 quite


incredible.
 And
 again
 this
 is
 you
 know


what
 Suchin
 was
 saying
 about
 AMD
 like


honestly
 Larry
 Ellson
 doesn't
 have
 300


billion
 in
 revenue
 but
 he
 has
 300


billion
 in
 performance
 obligations
 which


are
 not
 contracted
 as
 revenue
 in
 any


legal
 capacity.
 It's
 just
 what
 the


street
 is
 what
 the
 company
 believes
 if


they
 live
 up
 to
 their
 obligations
 they


will
 be
 able
 to
 achieve
 in
 contract


backlog.
 I
 agree
 with
 Such
 and
 that's


what
 Lisa
 Sue
 has
 got
 to
 do.
 She's
 got


to
 say,
 "Hey,
 we're
 increasing
 our
 RPO


by
 like
 80
 billion
 because
 it's
 like
 10


billion
 a
 gigawatt
 or
 something
 that


they
 have
 with
 OpenAI
 and
 it
 doesn't


have
 to
 be
 real
 today.
 The
 promise
 of
 it


just
 has
 to
 be
 real
 for
 tomorrow.


And
 that
 maybe
 is
 enough
 to


give
 it
 a
 pump,


but
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see.


We
 are
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 if
 they
 can


do
 that.
 We
 got
 the
 uh
 15
 minutes
 until


we
 get
 the
 FOMC
 decision
 and
 we're
 going


to
 see
 what
 we
 get.
 Palanteer
 19774,


Tesla
 still
 flat,
 and
 then
 Invidia
 right


there
 at
 206.
 Again,
 Pal
 is
 going
 to
 be


speaking
 at
 2:30,
 but
 in
 15
 minutes,


we're
 going to
 get
 the
 exact


the
 exact
 u
 decision
 on
 what's
 going
 to


happen
 or
 not.
 There's
 no
 news
 on


Google.
 We've
 been
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


what's
 happening.
 Uh
 the
 anthropic
 news


is
 a
 couple
 days
 old,
 so
 not
 sure
 why


it's
 pumping,
 but
 probably
 people


getting
 ready
 for
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move.
 Also,


again,
 guys,
 this
 is
 something
 we
 got
 to


be
 ready
 for.
 This
 could
 be
 ALGO
 just


setting
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 pump
 and


dump,
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 rug
 pull.
 This


has
 happened
 the
 past
 few
 FOMC
 meetings.


Now,
 the
 last
 one
 was
 really
 good


because
 we
 got
 the
 JPAL
 pivot,
 but
 the


two
 before
 that,
 you
 had
 a
 pump
 and
 then


you
 had
 a
 dump.
 The
 dump
 wasn't
 as


aggressive,
 but
 nonetheless,
 you
 did


have
 a
 dump.
 So,
 it
 is
 one
 of
 those


things
 that
 you
 have
 to
 just
 watch
 out


for
 when
 this
 takes
 place.


The
 rate
 cut
 in
 general
 should
 be
 rather


bullish.
 Ethereum
 right
 there


back
 at
 4,000.
 This
 was
 Paul
 Tudtor


Jones
 yesterday
 uh
 making
 the
 argument


that
 a
 blowoff
 the
 top
 which
 is
 when


things
 get
 so
 exuberant
 that
 they
 hit


such
 a
 you
 know
 such
 a
 peak
 that
 it's


almost
 easily
 identifiable
 why
 this
 was


the
 peak
 and
 then
 everything
 crashes.
 He


says
 we
 are
 in
 place
 for
 a
 rally
 before


we
 get
 that
 blowoff
 top.


>> Um
 well
 it
 it
 it's
 like
 the
 Prince
 song.


It's
 1999.
 Party
 like
 it's
 1999,
 right?


Feels
 exactly
 like


>> It's
 a
 great
 song,
 by
 the
 way,
 for
 those


who
 haven't
 heard
 it.
 Phenomenal
 song.


>> 1999.
 I
 don't
 know
 whether
 we'll


actually
 replay
 it
 exactly,
 but
 I
 think


all
 the
 ingredients
 are
 in
 place
 and


certainly
 from
 a
 trading
 standpoint,
 you


have
 to
 position
 yourself
 like
 it's


October
 99.
 Um,
 I
 don't
 see
 why
 you


would
 do
 anything
 but
 that.
 And


remember,
 the
 NASDAQ


doubled
 between
 the
 first
 week
 of


October
 99
 and
 March
 of
 2000.
 So,
 if
 it


looks
 like
 a
 duck
 and
 quacks
 like
 a


duck,
 it's
 probably
 not
 a
 chicken,


right?


>> But
 you
 think
 it's
 99?
 And
 we
 were


talking
 to
 Mike
 Novagrats
 earlier
 today.


It's
 not
 98.
 I
 mean,
 everyone's
 in
 the


it's
 either
 98,
 99,
 but
 it's
 not
 96.
 By


the
 way,
 Steve
 said
 yesterday
 it's
 1989.


>> So
 Steve
 thinks
 Steve
 thinks
 the
 party


has
 not
 even
 started,


>> I
 guess,
 is
 the
 point.
 And
 that's
 that's


a
 problem
 potentially,


>> right?


>> Or
 it's
 maybe
 an
 opportunity,
 but
 you


have
 to
 get
 on
 and
 off
 the
 train
 pretty


quick.


>> Well,
 if
 you
 just
 think
 about
 bull


markets,
 right,
 the
 the
 the
 greatest


price
 appreciation
 is
 always
 the
 12


months
 preceding
 the
 top.
 So
 that's
 the


nature
 of
 of
 a
 bull
 market.
 It
 kind
 of


doubles
 whatever
 the
 annual
 average
 is.


before
 then.
 So
 if
 you
 don't
 play
 it


>> right,


>> you're
 missing
 out
 on
 the
 juice.
 If
 you


do
 play
 it,
 you
 get
 you
 have
 to
 have


really
 happy
 feet
 because
 there
 will
 be


uh
 a
 really
 really
 bad
 end
 to
 it.
 And
 my


guess
 is
 that
 I
 think
 all
 the


ingredients
 are
 in
 place
 for
 some
 kind


of
 a
 blowoff.
 Will
 it
 happen?
 Again,


history
 rhymes
 a
 lot.
 So
 I
 would
 think


some
 version
 of
 it
 is
 going
 to
 happen


again.
 If
 if
 anything
 now
 is
 so
 much


more
 potentially
 explosive
 than
 1999.


1999
 we
 were
 looking
 at
 a
 rate
 hike
 in


November.
 Now
 we're
 looking
 at
 a
 rate


cut.
 We
 were
 looking
 at
 four
 more
 rate


hikes
 before
 we
 actually
 topped
 in
 2000.


Now
 we're
 looking
 at
 four
 rate
 well


three
 or
 four
 rate
 cuts
 probably
 at


least.
 So
 you
 have
 monetary
 policy


that's
 going
 to
 take
 us
 to
 real
 rates
 of


zero
 or
 less
 probably
 depending
 upon
 the


next
 Fed
 share.
 And
 then
 the
 big


difference
 is
 obviously
 fiscal
 policy.


We
 had
 a
 budget
 surplus
 in
 992000.
 Now


we've
 got
 a
 6%
 budget
 deficit.
 So
 that


combination,
 that
 fiscal
 monetary


combination
 is
 a
 brew
 that
 we
 haven't


seen
 since
 I
 guess
 the
 post-war
 period,


early
 50s,
 something
 like
 that.
 And
 that


was
 crazy
 times,
 right?
 Coming
 out
 of


the
 war.


>> But
 you
 think
 that
 most
 people
 who
 are


watching
 us
 now,
 you
 need
 to
 be
 in
 this


market
 now.
 But
 then
 the
 question,
 as
 I


said,
 is
 you
 have
 to
 jump
 off
 the
 train


before
 the
 train
 crashes.
 If
 you're


suggesting
 the
 train
 is
 going
 to
 crash,


>> I'm
 not
 suggesting
 the
 train's
 going
 to


crash.
 I'm
 suggesting
 that
 we're
 in
 a


period
 that's
 conducive
 for
 massive


price
 appreciation
 in
 a
 variety
 of


assets.
 Will
 it
 happen
 or
 not?
 I
 don't


know.
 There's
 if
 you
 kind
 of
 just
 look


if
 you
 just
 think
 about
 the
 leverage


that
 we
 had
 in
 1999,
 you
 look
 at
 margin


debt
 and
 then
 you
 look
 at
 today
 margin


debt,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 throw
 in
 leverage


ETFs
 because
 people
 don't
 use
 margin


like
 they
 did
 back
 then.
 We're
 probably


a
 little
 more
 elevated
 than
 we
 were
 in


October
 of
 99.
 It
 will
 take
 a


speculative
 frenzy
 for
 us
 to
 elevate


those
 prices,
 right?
 It
 will
 take
 more


retail
 buying.
 It'll
 take
 more


recruitment
 from
 a
 variety
 of
 other
 from


long
 short
 hedge
 funds,
 from
 real
 money,


etc.
 It'll
 take
 a
 a
 combination
 of
 those


things.
 It's
 not
 going
 to
 go
 up
 without


flows
 and
 without
 a
 story.
 The
 story


is
 there.
 is
 the
 combination
 of
 the
 most


unique
 and
 aggressive
 fiscal
 and


monetary
 uh
 conditions
 that
 we've
 ever


seen.


>> Okay.


>> And
 look,
 I
 I
 think
 he's
 right
 about


that.
 By
 the
 way,
 pounder
 trying
 to
 make


a
 move
 potentially
 at
 199.
 But
 he's


making
 two
 points
 right
 there.
 That


retail
 is
 going
 to
 have
 to
 get
 really


excited
 again,
 which
 retail
 is
 already


very
 excited.
 So
 the
 level
 of
 a
 blowoff


top
 euphoric
 retail
 excitement,
 I
 don't


even
 know
 what
 that
 looks
 like.
 I
 mean,


I
 genuinely
 don't
 know
 what
 that
 would


look
 like.
 it
 would
 have
 to
 be
 a


magnitude
 above
 what
 we're
 seeing


already.
 Uh
 he's
 right
 about
 the


leveraged
 ETFs
 increasing
 the
 types
 of


margin
 people
 are
 using.
 So
 instead
 of


borrowing
 money,
 if
 you're
 going
 double


XX
 leveraged
 on
 these
 ETFs,
 which


there's
 about
 705
 of
 the
 the
 levered


versions
 of
 them,
 which
 is
 an
 all-time


high,
 that
 is
 another
 form
 of
 margin


that
 could
 be
 entering
 into
 the
 system.


Uh
 and
 then
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 have


really
 good
 monetary
 policy.
 Now,
 the


one
 problem
 with
 that
 turning
 into
 this


massive
 euphoric
 top
 is
 that
 if
 the


earnings
 growth
 continues
 to
 catch
 up


with
 it,
 which
 today
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


big
 day
 to
 see
 if
 that
 does,
 then
 maybe


it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 as
 euphoric
 if


there's
 enough
 earnings
 to
 justify
 it.


By
 the
 way,
 pound
 your
 all-time
 highs


here.
 1985


19850
 was
 the
 alltime
 high.
 I'll
 check


199
 resistance,
 but


looks
 like
 she's
 going
 for
 it.
 Uh,
 so


the
 the
 recipes
 are
 in
 place,
 but
 again,


I
 feel
 like
 for
 it
 to
 be
 so
 euphoric,


you
 would
 still
 need
 companies
 to
 not


execute
 for
 there
 to
 be
 a
 reason
 for
 the


selling
 to
 eventually
 happen,
 which
 is


what
 we
 saw
 in
 21
 with
 rate
 hikes
 and


obviously
 companies
 just
 weren't
 able
 to


put
 up
 the
 earnings
 growth
 necessary
 to


maintain
 their
 multiples.


In
 this
 situation,
 you
 do
 have
 those


companies
 putting
 up
 earnings.
 199
 is


41,000
 shares.
 41,000
 shares.
 Dude,
 I


was
 saying
 maybe
 we
 see
 200
 after


earnings.
 I've
 been
 saying
 it
 for
 the


past
 two
 weeks


and
 now
 it's
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 it
 it
 is


a
 little
 I
 mean
 look
 whenever
 something


runs
 up
 before
 earnings
 if
 the
 earnings


don't
 deliver
 absolutely
 what
 the
 street


was
 expecting
 then
 it
 could
 get
 hit
 as


any
 stock
 can
 get
 hit
 uh
 as
 a
 runup
 into


earnings
 but
 if
 the
 earnings
 deliver


even
 better
 I
 mean
 this
 thing's
 going


above
 200


but
 we
 got
 to
 see
 what
 we
 can
 get
 on


those
 earnings


Um


the
 earnings
 growth
 for
 the
 12
 months


preceding
 the
 dotcom
 burst
 was
 almost
 20


to
 30%.
 So
 that
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be


enough
 to
 stop
 it.
 Look,
 that's
 a
 fair


point.
 I
 would
 say
 here
 the
 earnings


growth
 has
 to
 persist
 in
 a
 in
 a


meaningful
 way,
 right?
 Like
 we
 we
 need


multiple
 multiple
 years
 of
 earnings


growth
 and
 we
 would,
 you
 know,
 this
 year


I
 would
 say
 2025
 has
 been
 the
 only
 first


quote
 unquote
 year
 of
 earnings
 growth


because
 23
 you
 had
 some
 growth
 but
 it


was
 whatever.
 24
 you
 were
 just
 starting


to
 see
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 peak.
 For
 the


past
 three
 quarters
 in
 2025,
 Q3
 is
 not


over
 yet
 in
 25,
 but
 based
 on
 what
 we've


seen
 so
 far,
 it's
 been
 double
 digit


earnings
 growth.
 We
 didn't
 have
 that
 in


24
 at
 least.
 I
 don't
 remember
 companies


beating
 by
 an
 average
 of
 10%.


Uh
 I
 think
 Q2
 is
 8.5%
 on
 EPS.
 So
 that


would
 have
 to
 happen
 for
 the
 coming


years
 to
 get
 more
 money
 to
 be
 excited
 to


be,
 you
 know,
 taking
 on
 the
 risk
 of
 of


of
 investing
 in
 an
 equity


in
 order
 for
 it
 to
 not
 feel
 as


exuberant.


But
 again,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 a
 weird


time,
 guys.
 guys,
 we
 had
 a
 3%
 draw
 down


and
 people
 went
 and
 bought
 the
 dip
 like


it
 was
 like
 there
 was
 no
 tomorrow
 back


on
 October
 10th.
 Like
 I
 really
 wonder


what
 it
 would
 take
 for
 people
 to
 just


say
 I
 am
 not
 going
 to
 buy.
 I'm
 gonna


stay
 in
 cash
 whenever
 I
 have
 the


quoteunquote
 opportunity
 of
 a
 dip


because
 everyone's
 so
 conditioned
 to


buy.


And
 it's
 like
 I
 don't
 I
 I
 don't
 know


over
 the
 next
 I
 mean
 you
 would
 have
 to


have
 some
 really
 aggressive
 uh
 downturns


for
 people
 to
 feel
 so
 scared
 to
 put


money
 back
 into
 the
 market
 because
 again


retail's
 just
 not
 been
 scared


and
 as
 a
 result
 the
 hedge
 funds
 have


started
 to
 you
 know
 have
 to
 capitulate


and
 they
 can't
 be
 as
 scared
 as
 they
 were


before
 as
 well.


Yeah.
 Joby
 partnership
 with
 Nvidia
 we


saw
 that
 yesterday.
 That's
 why
 Nvidia


got
 a
 move
 or
 that's
 why
 Joby
 got
 a
 move


yesterday
 as
 well.
 Lumen,
 I
 don't
 know


what
 happened
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 days.


They
 announced
 that
 Ballinger


partnership.
 Stock's
 been
 doing
 great.


Look
 at
 that.
 Up
 11%
 on
 the
 day.
 I
 don't


think
 these
 guys
 had
 earnings
 yet.


But
 this
 one
 has
 been
 making
 a
 move.
 The


only
 negative
 catalyst
 is
 no
 rate
 cuts.


Yeah,
 like
 again,
 we
 spent
 a
 good
 amount


of
 time
 today
 talking
 about
 the
 labor


market.
 It
 is
 inevitable
 we
 are
 going
 to


get
 rate
 cuts.
 JPAL
 has
 no
 choice
 but
 to


cut
 these
 rates.


Like
 one
 of
 the
 only
 cushions
 the
 Fed


has
 in
 a
 structural
 change
 via
 AI
 on
 the


economy
 for
 labor
 markets
 is
 uh
 cutting


rates
 and
 today
 will
 be
 the
 first
 day


where
 they
 continue
 to
 begin
 that.
 We


have
 five
 minutes
 folks.
 Five
 minutes


for
 this
 rate
 cut.
 All
 right.
 What
 are


we
 doing?
 What
 are
 we
 doing?
 Is
 anyone


buying
 something?
 Selling
 something?
 Is


anyone
 doing
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 trade?


What
 are
 the
 prediction
 markets
 saying?


I
 think
 it's
 got
 to
 be
 like
 99%.


It's
 got
 to
 be
 99%
 on
 the
 rate
 cut.


Yeah,
 it's
 not
 even
 worth
 taking
 a
 bet,


dude.
 It's
 99%
 cut
 25.


Being
 nervous.
 We
 all
 know
 it's
 a
 rate


cut.
 I'm
 just
 curious
 what's
 going
 to


happen.


What
 are
 we
 going
 to
 see?
 I
 wonder
 if


it's
 an
 immediate
 knee-jerk
 reaction
 up


or
 down.


The
 United
 States
 announced
 the
 deal


with
 Korea
 in
 the
 morning.
 We
 talked


about
 that
 in
 the
 morning.
 They
 have
 a


bunch
 of
 different
 investments
 Korea
 is


uh
 pledging
 to
 put
 into
 the
 United


States.


But
 no
 specific
 news
 just
 now
 on
 US
 and


Korea.
 China
 US
 tomorrow.
 That's
 going


to
 be
 really
 important
 as
 well.
 That


should
 be
 happening
 at
 11
 a.m.


That's
 what
 scares
 me.
 We're
 all
 too


convinced.
 Well,
 I
 am
 I
 am
 not
 there.


There
 is
 zero
 hesitation
 in
 my
 brain


about
 us
 getting
 a
 rate
 cut.
 I
 I
 am


I
 guess
 you
 could
 I
 I
 just
 have
 no
 idea


how
 the
 market
 would
 react.
 If
 we
 were


in
 red
 today,
 I
 feel
 like
 the
 rate
 cut


would
 be
 the
 bolt,
 but
 we're
 at
 alltime


highs.
 So,
 it's
 kind
 of
 like,
 okay,
 is


Nvidia
 just
 going
 back
 up
 to
 212
 when
 we


cut
 the
 rates?
 Like,
 we
 already
 know


we're
 cutting
 the
 rates.
 Is
 it
 fully


baked
 in?
 Is
 it
 going
 to
 tank
 after
 the


rate
 cut
 because
 markets
 are
 like,
 "All


right,
 we
 got
 it
 and
 now
 we
 can
 take


some
 profits
 and
 get
 ready."
 Like,
 I
 I


don't
 know.
 I
 am
 very
 curious
 to
 see


what
 this
 happens.
 Let's
 make
 my
 tweet.


This
 is
 how
 we
 make
 the
 tweet
 every
 time


before


before
 the
 ray
 cut.


All right,


breaking.


Jerome
 Pal


and
 the
 Federal


Reserve


have
 lowered
 interest
 rates
 by
 25
 basis


points.


Boom.
 Then
 we
 need
 a
 good
 photo
 of
 JPAL.


Which
 photo
 do
 we
 use?
 Oh,
 look
 at
 that.


That's
 a
 new
 one.
 I
 like
 that
 one.
 I


think
 we
 go
 with
 this.
 Do
 we
 go
 with


this?


This
 is
 my
 favorite
 one
 of
 JPAL.
 I
 I've


seen
 so
 many
 JPAL
 pictures.
 I
 have


favorites.
 Is
 that
 kind
 of
 weird?
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 that
 weird,
 bro.
 It's


like
 It's
 the
 Fed
 chair.
 You
 gotta
 you


gotta
 know
 this
 this
 is
 actually
 this


one
 you
 know
 this
 picture
 is
 a


that's
 a
 younger
 Jerome
 you
 know what
 I


mean
 that
 picture
 is
 a
 definitely
 a
 nice


picture
 as
 well
 if
 you
 know
 what
 I
 mean


it's
 a
 good
 picture
 this
 one


I
 think
 we'll
 do
 this
 one's
 a
 good
 one


too


this
 looks
 like
 James
 Bond
 bro
 the


thumbs
 up
 picture


thumbs
 up
 are
 you


Are
 you
 sure?
 All
 right,
 if
 you
 guys
 are


sure.
 We
 got
 two
 minutes,
 so
 we
 have
 to


make
 a
 decision.


This
 one's
 a
 good
 one,
 too.


Thumbs
 up.
 Thumbs
 up.


Okay.


All right.
 That's
 what
 we're
 doing.


That
 is
 what
 we
 are
 doing


actually.
 No,
 I
 don't
 like
 that,
 bro.


That's
 We
 can't
 do
 that
 one.
 That's


getting
 cut
 off.
 Oh,
 no.
 We
 have
 a


minute.
 We
 have
 a
 minute.
 We
 have
 to


pick
 it.


All right,
 we're
 going
 with
 Old


Faithful.
 That
 one's
 getting
 cut
 off,


guys.
 We
 can't
 do
 that
 one.
 Twitter's


cutting
 it
 off.
 It's
 turning
 it
 into
 a


box.
 It's
 like


it's
 going
 to
 make
 it
 look
 weird
 when
 it


pops
 up
 on
 the
 feed.


All
 right,
 here
 we
 go.
 Here
 we
 go.
 Let


me
 go
 to
 FOMC.


Uh,
 we
 should
 be
 getting
 the
 results
 any


second.


30
 seconds.


Let
 me
 just
 pull
 this
 up
 in
 the


background.


All right,
 folks.
 Do
 we
 think
 we're


getting
 it?
 Are
 we
 getting
 the
 cuts?


Are
 we
 getting
 the
 cut?
 Are
 we
 getting


the
 cut?
 I
 will
 give
 you
 guys
 as
 soon
 as


I
 see
 it
 come
 across
 my
 feed.


I'm
 on
 their
 website.


So,
 we
 all
 know
 what's
 going
 to
 happen,


but
 we're
 just
 like
 waiting.


All
 right,
 here
 we
 go.
 I'm
 waiting
 for


the
 press
 release.
 I'm
 waiting
 for
 it.


All
 right,
 it's
 2
 p.m.
 Dude,
 if
 it's
 50,


that's
 going
 to
 be
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


50,
 but
 if
 it's
 50,
 that
 would
 be
 crazy.


Is
 it
 25?
 Is
 it
 25?
 I'm
 on
 the
 website.


Uh,
 I
 don't
 see
 it
 yet.


It's
 probably
 25.
 It
 should
 be
 popping


up
 very
 soon.


Should
 be
 popping
 up
 soon.
 Okay,
 I
 think


we
 got
 it.
 I
 think
 it's
 25


to
 4%.
 There
 were
 two
 descents
 on
 this.


The
 second
 one


>> is
 25.
 Two
 descents.


>> One
 by
 new
 Fed
 Governor
 Myron
 who
 wanted


50.
 first
 one
 by
 Kansas
 City
 Fed


President
 Jeff
 Smith
 who
 wanted
 no


change.
 So
 dissents
 on
 both
 sides,
 a


kind
 of
 a
 rare
 occurrence
 for
 the
 Fed.


The
 Federal
 Reserve
 announcing
 it
 is


stopping
 quantitative
 tightening
 or
 the


roll
 off
 of
 its
 balance
 sheet
 as
 soon
 as


December.
 Um
 all
 rolloffs
 of
 treasuries


from
 here
 on
 out
 and
 mortgage
 back


securities
 on
 the
 Fed's
 balance
 sheet


will
 now
 be
 invested
 into
 T
 bills.
 It's


a
 bit
 of
 a
 change
 there.
 on
 the
 economy.


The
 Fed
 said
 economic
 activity
 expanded


at
 a
 moderate
 pace.
 According
 to


available
 indicators,
 one
 of
 two
 nods
 in


the
 statement
 to
 the
 absence
 of
 data
 by


the
 Federal
 Reserve.
 It
 had


>> no
 pump
 on
 the
 markets.
 If
 anything,


you're
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 red,


nothing
 crazy.
 I
 mean,
 a
 little
 bit
 of


green
 on
 some
 of
 these
 stocks,
 but


you
 wouldn't
 be
 able
 to
 differentiate
 it


too
 much
 from
 what
 we
 saw
 yesterday
 or


from
 what
 we
 saw
 like
 five
 minutes
 ago.


Nothing
 too
 crazy
 right
 now.
 said
 in


September
 that
 the
 economy
 was


moderating.
 So
 almost
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 an


upgrade
 to
 the
 economy,
 but
 according
 to


available
 data,
 job
 gains,
 it
 said,
 has


slowed.
 However,
 unemployment
 remained


low
 through
 August.
 And
 again,
 it
 said


more
 recent
 indicators
 are
 consistent


with
 these
 developments.
 That's
 another


nod
 to
 the
 idea
 that
 the
 Fed
 doesn't


really
 have
 the
 official
 data.
 More


recent
 indicators
 is
 what
 it's
 using.


Inflation,
 it
 says,
 has
 moved
 up
 since


earlier
 this
 year
 and
 remains
 somewhat


elevated.
 That
 is
 the
 same


characterization
 as
 September.
 And


there's
 not
 much
 in
 the
 way
 of
 of
 uh


forecasting
 the
 future
 path
 of
 rates.
 I


believe
 that
 will
 have
 to
 wait
 for
 the


um
 press
 conference
 from
 Fed
 Chair


Powell.
 But
 again,
 the
 Fed
 cutting
 by
 a


quarter,
 two
 dissents
 on
 both
 sides
 of


the
 uh
 of
 the
 issue.
 One
 pro
 wanted


more,
 one
 wanted
 none
 at
 all.
 And
 the


Fed
 stopping
 quantitative
 tightening
 as


of
 December,
 guys.
 So,
 no
 QT


in
 December,
 which
 means
 we're
 going
 to


stop
 selling
 off
 bonds,
 which
 is
 really


good
 for
 the
 US
 balance
 sheet,
 very
 good


for
 liquidity,
 great
 for
 the
 M2
 money


supply.
 Market
 should
 love
 that.
 Where


is
 Bitcoin?
 Are
 we
 getting
 any
 move
 on


Bitcoin?


Uh,
 yeah,
 you
 got
 a
 green
 candle
 to
 112.


A
 little
 bit
 below
 112.
 So,
 you
 got
 a


little bit
 of
 move
 there.
 ETH
 basically


flat
 at
 4,000
 but
 you
 have
 uh
 no
 QT
 in


December.
 Uh
 someone
 dissented
 and
 they


said
 no
 cut.
 The
 other
 person
 descented


Moran
 and
 said
 50
 cuts
 or
 50
 basis


points.


So


the
 majority
 of
 people
 agreed
 that
 25
 is


the
 right
 option.
 One
 person
 wanted
 to


be
 more
 bullish.
 One
 person
 wanted
 to
 be


a
 little
 bit
 more
 bearish.
 The
 bond


yields
 are
 higher.


People
 are
 selling
 off
 bonds
 on
 this


news.
 How
 about
 gold?
 Gold
 is
 also


higher.
 Little
 bit
 higher.
 Not
 crazy


higher,
 but
 above
 4,000.
 Same
 thing
 with


silver.


Up
 1.98%.


SoFi
 dumping.
 Is
 it


okay?
 It's
 not.
 Well,
 it's
 it's
 it


potentially
 is
 going
 to
 lose
 31
 right


here.
 You're
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


back
 stop
 at
 31.
 Nvidia,
 I
 mean,
 at


least
 it's
 holding
 200,
 which
 is
 nice
 to


see.
 Pound
 here
 just
 below
 198.
 The


Googles
 still
 holding
 basically
 273.
 TLT


is
 obviously
 down
 because
 the
 10
 years


up.
 Apples
 down
 a
 little bit.
 NFA
 still


down
 11%.
 Microsoft
 down
 half
 a
 percent


from
 Azure.
 Dell's
 flat.
 Rocket
 Lab's
 up


4.2.
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 any
 headline


on
 Rocket
 Lab,
 but
 that's
 helping
 it


out.
 Uh
 how
 about
 the
 Rare
 Earth
 plays?


What's
 going
 on
 with
 them?
 They
 are
 all


red
 except
 one.
 Uh
 Bitcoin
 miners
 are


all
 red
 except
 CleanSpark,
 Bit
 Farms,


Hive,
 Marathon,
 and
 Riot.
 The
 rest
 of


them
 are
 down.


Amcor
 is
 slightly
 green.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is


pretty
 flat,
 guys.
 We're
 not
 getting


we're
 not
 getting
 a
 big
 move.
 Even


though
 he
 is
 confirming
 quantitative


tightening
 is
 going
 to
 end
 by
 December.


Last
 time
 he
 said
 it
 in
 an
 interview,
 he


said
 we
 might
 be
 ending
 it
 soon.
 Today,


he's
 confirming
 that
 by
 the
 end
 of the


year,
 there's
 no
 more
 there's
 no
 more


QT.
 Tesla
 going
 slightly
 green.


Yeah,
 feels
 like
 it
 was
 priced
 in.
 Feels


like
 it
 was
 priced
 in,
 folks.
 In
 about


20
 minutes,
 we
 will
 have
 the
 actual


meeting
 with
 JPAL,
 but
 so
 far
 definitely


feels
 like
 this
 was
 more
 priced
 in
 than


not.
 And
 I
 mean,
 it
 it
 should
 be,
 right?


The
 street
 kind
 of
 knew
 what
 was
 going


to
 happen.
 There
 was
 a
 99%
 chance


and
 ALOS
 will
 likely
 still
 have
 to
 wait


until
 we
 get
 some
 more
 results.
 Let's


get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 coverage
 on
 this,


but
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 is
 cutting
 by
 25


bits.


have
 moved
 maybe
 higher
 by
 anywhere
 from


what
 I
 could
 see
 one
 to
 three
 basis


points.
 This
 is
 all
 about
 the
 Fed
 rate


press
 conference
 now
 at
 this
 point.
 But


what
 stood
 out
 to
 you
 from
 hearing
 what


you
 heard
 from
 Steve
 and
 then
 what
 you


saw
 or
 didn't
 see
 from
 the
 market


reaction?


>> So
 that's
 a
 great
 question.
 So
 I
 I
 think


that
 we
 are
 in
 the
 sweet
 spot
 of
 policy


uncertainty
 for
 markets.
 And
 what
 I
 mean


by
 that
 is
 that
 we're
 expecting
 there
 to


be
 better
 growth
 in
 2026,
 but
 at
 the


same
 time,
 we're
 also
 expecting
 the
 Fed


to
 cut
 interest
 rates.
 So
 you
 may
 have


higher
 growth,
 you
 may
 have
 a
 labor


market
 which
 is
 keeping
 wage
 inflation


and
 wages
 relatively,
 you
 know,
 stable,


which
 keeps
 profit
 margins
 high
 for


companies.
 And
 again,
 better
 growth,


lower
 rates.
 You're
 discounting
 those


future
 cash
 flows
 at
 a
 lower
 rate.


You're
 increasing
 the
 present
 value.
 And


what
 it's
 doing
 is
 it's
 supporting


valuation.
 So
 this
 uncertainty
 that's


being
 discussed
 right
 now
 with
 the
 labor


market
 and
 what
 Fed
 policy
 is
 likely
 to


do
 and
 lower
 interest
 rates,
 equities
 of


the
 beneficiary.


>> Okay,
 David,
 you
 you
 see
 it
 all
 from
 an


from
 an
 asset
 management
 perspective.


Does
 this
 change
 at
 all
 anything
 with


regard
 to
 how
 you
 view
 future


allocations,
 how
 new
 client
 money
 gets


put
 to
 work?
 What
 exactly
 does
 this
 mean


in
 the
 construct
 of
 how
 investors
 have


to
 view
 what
 this
 rate
 decision
 will


mean
 for
 them?
 Well,
 I
 think
 the
 one


interesting
 thing
 was
 that
 descent
 uh
 uh


in
 terms
 of
 not
 cutting
 at
 all
 from
 the


Kansas
 City
 Fed
 president.
 I
 think
 that


that
 is
 really
 interesting
 uh
 because
 it


does
 says
 it
 says
 it
 says
 that
 there's


some
 push
 back
 and
 I
 think
 the
 push
 back


isn't
 about
 the
 economy.
 I
 think
 it
 is


about
 you
 know
 how
 strong
 markets
 have


been
 this
 year
 and
 if
 that
 gathers
 a


little
 little
 uh
 momentum
 we
 may
 see
 Fed


easing
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 slowly
 next


year.
 So
 maybe
 not
 heading
 straight
 down


to
 3%.
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 investors
 here
 you


I
 think
 it's
 been
 a
 wonderful
 year
 for


investors
 but
 that
 follows
 two
 great


years
 and
 you
 know
 I'd
 say
 rebalance


rebalance
 rebalance
 I
 mean
 I
 think


people
 just
 need
 to
 make
 look
 at
 the


risk
 side
 of
 their
 portfolios
 and
 not


just
 the
 the
 very
 strong
 gains
 that


we've
 seen
 in
 equity
 markets


>> Francis
 you


right
 there
 you
 go
 the
 coveted
 25
 bips


we
 have
 seen
 in
 the
 next
 20
 minutes


we'll
 get
 JPAL
 to
 cough
 and
 say
 good


afternoon
 and
 uh
 avoid
 any
 questions


about
 Trump,


but
 all
 of
 that
 will
 start
 in
 the
 next


20
 minutes.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 street


is
 going
 to
 want
 him
 to
 say
 to
 really


get
 more
 excited.
 I
 mean,
 he
 said
 he's


not
 going
 to
 do
 QT


and
 he
 has
 said
 that


uh
 well,
 he
 has
 not
 said
 that,
 but
 it


looks
 like
 the
 the
 the
 summary
 of


economic
 projections
 is
 signaling
 that


December
 we're
 likely
 going
 to
 get


another
 rate
 cut.
 So,
 we
 got
 one
 more


left
 for
 the
 year.


I
 mean,
 this
 is
 all
 bullish,
 but
 again,


like
 the
 S&P
 is
 at
 alltime
 highs.
 Like,


it's
 like
 no
 one
 can
 be
 upset
 right
 now,


you
 know?
 It's
 like,
 all
 right,
 Nvidia


207,
 S&P
 688.
 I
 mean,
 we
 probably
 were


going
 to
 just
 bust
 through
 690
 just
 off


of
 the
 rate
 cut
 that's
 priced
 in,
 but


it's
 not
 like
 anyone
 could
 be
 too
 upset.


68840.


Yeah,
 it's
 not
 like
 we
 dumped
 exactly


when
 you
 had
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 red
 on
 some


names.
 Ethereum
 going
 red,
 Bitcoin
 going


a
 little
 red,
 but
 outside
 of
 that,
 it's


still
 strong.
 Here
 is
 uh
 what
 the
 Fed


said.
 So
 again,
 they're
 going
 to


reinvest
 the
 principal
 payments
 from
 the


Federal
 Reserves
 holdings
 of
 agency
 debt


and
 agency
 mortgage
 back
 securities


received
 in
 October,
 November
 that


exceeds
 a
 cap
 of
 35
 billion
 a
 month
 into


Treasury
 securities
 to
 roughly
 match
 the


maturity
 composition
 of
 Treasury


securities
 outstanding,


aka
 no
 more
 QT.
 Usually
 they
 would
 be


selling
 those
 assets
 off
 which
 is
 we've


been
 doing
 QT
 for
 the
 past
 two
 and
 a


half
 years.
 So
 the
 fact
 that
 it's


changing
 now


is
 important.
 Um
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right


here
 JPEL
 says
 job
 gains
 have
 slowed


this
 year
 and
 the
 unemployment
 rate
 has


edged
 up
 but
 remained
 low.
 Inflation


through
 August.
 More
 recent
 indicators


are
 consistent
 with
 these
 developments.


Inflation
 has
 moved
 up
 earlier
 since
 in


the
 year.


The
 new
 chair
 announcement
 should
 be
 in


December.
 Trump
 said
 he
 would
 announce


it
 in
 December.
 So,
 I
 don't
 think
 we're


going to
 have
 to
 wait
 till
 January,
 but


we
 will
 get
 it
 in
 December.


TLT
 is
 down.
 Yes,
 as
 the
 10-year
 spikes


up.
 I
 mean,
 the
 10ear
 spiking
 up
 is
 kind


of
 not
 that
 surprising


as
 investors
 are
 potentially
 asking
 for


a
 better
 rate
 to


get
 their
 capital
 stuck
 in
 bonds.
 Also,


I
 mean,
 look,
 even
 though
 rates
 are


coming
 down,
 if
 rates
 are
 coming
 down


and
 that's
 good
 for
 equities,
 you
 might


have
 some
 investors
 going
 more
 risk
 on


and
 saying
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 stuck
 in


4%
 yielding
 bonds
 when
 Nvidia
 just
 went


up
 10%
 in
 less
 than
 24
 hours.


So,
 that
 that
 could
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 more


of
 the
 money
 coming
 off
 the
 bond
 market


side
 going
 into
 equities,


but
 you
 do
 have
 the
 S&P
 relatively
 flat


from
 before
 the
 announcement.


Still
 don't
 know
 why
 Google's
 running


the
 way
 it's
 running.


Still
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 why
 Google
 made
 it.


2%
 move
 on
 Google
 is
 not
 small
 but
 I


feel
 like
 it's
 anticipation
 of
 earnings.


Um
 is
 the
 rate
 season
 as
 a
 response
 to


the
 economic
 downturn?
 Yes.
 I
 mean
 I


would
 imagine
 again
 we
 talked
 a
 lot


about
 the
 labor
 market
 not
 being
 the


best.
 There's
 tons
 of
 different
 stats


about
 layoffs.
 So
 yes,
 it's
 in
 response


to
 the
 labor
 market.
 I
 mean
 that's
 what


JPL
 said
 in
 his
 statement.
 But
 on
 top
 of


that,
 it's
 also
 in
 response
 to
 the
 fact


that
 they
 just
 can't
 be
 as
 restrictive


as
 they've
 been
 for
 the
 past
 two
 and
 a


half
 years,


especially
 if
 they
 see
 any
 level
 of


weakness.
 Uh
 the
 committee
 seeks
 to


achieve
 maximum
 employment
 and
 inflation


at
 the
 rate
 of
 2%
 over
 the
 long
 run.


Uncertainty
 about
 the
 economic
 outlook


remains
 elevated.
 The
 committee
 is


attentive
 to
 the
 risk
 to
 both
 sides
 of


his
 dual
 mandate
 and
 judges
 that
 the


downside
 risks
 to
 employment
 rose
 in


recent
 months.
 There
 you
 go.
 That's
 your


quote.
 The
 downside
 risk
 to
 unemployment


has
 rose
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 months.


leading
 them
 to
 feel
 more
 cautious
 about


cutting
 rates.


And
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 Why
 is
 Nokia


down?
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 I'm


not
 sure.
 I
 mean,
 well,
 if
 I
 had
 to


guess,
 it
 would
 be
 that
 they
 went
 up
 25%


yesterday.
 So,
 going
 down
 5%
 is
 not,
 you


know,
 crazy.
 It's
 giving
 back
 a
 little


bit
 of
 those
 gains.


People
 taking
 profits
 on
 Nokia.
 I
 I


don't
 think
 it
 has
 to
 do
 much
 with
 the


rate
 cuts.


You
 know,
 this
 might
 be
 one
 of
 the
 more


boring
 uh
 FOMC
 meetings
 in
 terms
 of


stock
 market
 reactions
 because
 this
 is


like
 everyone
 knew
 it
 was
 a
 rate
 cut.


There
 was
 really
 no
 controversy
 there.


And
 Nvidia
 kind
 of
 stole
 the
 show


yesterday
 by
 basically
 saying
 AI
 is
 real


and
 we're
 increasing
 our
 estimates
 and


you
 got
 the
 entire
 market
 thinking,


okay,
 maybe
 that
 matters
 a
 lot
 more
 than


rate
 cuts.


And
 we
 already
 know
 we're
 getting
 those


rate
 cuts.
 Yeah,
 he's
 going
 to
 be
 live


in
 about
 15
 minutes
 for
 JPAL
 and
 then


we'll
 switch
 to
 him.
 Bitcoin
 right
 there


111.5


on
 the
 day.


I
 think
 none
 of
 us
 should
 be
 too
 mad


about
 a
 about
 a
 nonvolatile
 as
 long
 as


we
 don't
 lose
 the
 gains,
 right?


Not
 losing
 it,
 even
 if
 it's
 not


dramatically
 increasing,
 I
 don't
 think


is
 the
 worst
 thing
 as
 we
 get
 toward
 the


end
 of
 the
 year.
 Dude,
 we
 have
 two
 days


left
 of
 of
 October,
 too.
 That's
 crazy.


Like,
 we
 are
 heading
 into
 the
 last
 two


months
 of
 the
 year.


And
 so
 all
 these
 earnings,
 all
 these


macro
 events,
 they
 are
 going
 to


culminate
 as
 we
 get
 into
 the
 final
 two


trading
 months


of
 2025.
 Here's
 a
 little
 bit
 more


coverage
 on
 these
 rate
 cuts
 before
 the


announcement
 at
 top
 of
 the
 hour.
 You
 can


see
 that
 we're
 slightly
 elevated
 in


yields
 and
 yields
 were
 already
 up
 a


little
 bit
 on
 the
 session.
 But
 here's


the
 point.
 You
 know
 where
 they
 were


before
 the
 last
 interest
 rate
 cut?
 So


they
 cut
 on
 the
 16th,
 they
 cut
 today.
 on


the
 15th,
 the
 day
 before
 the
 September


cut,
 a
 2-year
 closed
 at
 354.


They're
 virtually
 unchanged.
 Look
 at
 the


10-year
 now.
 Okay,
 the
 tenure
 was


hovering
 right
 around
 4%.
 So,
 it's
 a


little
 hotter
 since
 the
 announcement
 in


the
 rate
 cut.
 Where
 was
 it?
 The
 day


before
 the
 September
 cut
 404
 virtually


unchanged.
 the
 dollar
 index,
 we
 see
 that


it's
 improved
 slightly,
 highly
 unchanged


since
 the
 25
 base
 point
 rate
 cut.
 And


the
 day
 after
 the
 15th,
 the
 16th
 when


they
 actually
 cut
 rates
 is
 when
 the


dollar
 index
 made
 its
 multi-year
 low.


So,
 the
 point
 here
 is
 we're
 all
 talking


about
 the
 Fed
 and
 cutting
 rates.
 It


certainly
 looks
 like
 December's
 priced


in
 and
 Jim
 Carro's
 probably
 right.


probably
 get
 one
 more
 next
 year.
 But
 the


issue
 is
 we're
 all
 looking
 towards
 the


yield
 curve
 and
 especially
 thinking


about
 housing
 and
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 curve.


But
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 curve
 is
 bucking
 the


trend.
 We've
 had
 a
 cumulative
 50
 basis


points
 and
 basically
 the
 interest
 rate


markets
 are
 unchanged.
 And
 since
 the


October
 first
 shutdown
 of
 the


government,
 the
 yield
 curve
 is


flattening,
 which
 tells
 me
 there's


nervousness
 that
 it's
 negatively


affecting
 the
 economy.
 Back
 to
 you,


>> Rick.
 If
 I
 could
 just
 follow
 up
 here,


what
 sense
 do
 you
 get
 from
 the
 trading


community
 out
 there
 where
 you
 are
 in


Chicago
 that
 the
 Fed
 is
 on
 the
 right


path
 with
 a
 potential
 campaign
 or
 or
 a


trajectory
 of
 lower
 interest
 rates
 over


the
 next
 several
 months?


Well,
 they
 like
 that
 because
 it
 most


likely
 helps
 positions,
 but
 in
 the
 grand


scheme
 of
 things,
 most
 sources
 I
 talked


to
 think
 it's
 very
 difficult
 to
 grade


what
 the
 Fed's
 doing
 because
 their
 GPS


wasn't
 doing
 all
 that
 great
 when
 the


government
 was
 open
 to
 data
 was


questionable.
 Now,
 how
 are
 they
 getting


data?
 I
 know
 they
 put
 it
 together
 and


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 anecdotal
 puzzle
 pieces


they're
 using,
 but
 in
 the
 end,
 my


comment
 would
 be,
 and
 I
 don't
 mean
 this


in
 a
 derogatory
 fashion,
 but
 I
 think


that
 the
 grade
 for
 the
 Federal
 Reserve


is
 see
 it
 best
 with
 my
 sources.
 And
 they


believe
 that
 the
 economy
 is
 going
 to


reheat
 and
 definitely
 keep
 the
 rate
 cut


cycle
 to
 a
 minimum
 compared
 to
 what
 some


are
 looking
 forward
 towards
 2026.


Now
 look,
 that
 is
 definitely
 possible


because
 you
 do
 have
 a
 little bit
 more
 of


a
 hawkish
 Fed.
 IWM,
 by
 the
 way,
 slightly


up,
 but
 you
 do
 have
 some
 red
 candles.


However,
 by
 May
 of
 next
 year,


Trump's
 replacing
 Powell.
 And
 there
 was


a
 report
 last
 night
 uh
 in
 Japan.
 I
 mean,


Trump
 like
 uh
 said
 this
 publicly
 that
 he


wants
 Bent
 to
 be
 the
 Fed
 chair,
 but
 he


also
 said
 that
 if
 Bent
 wants
 to
 be
 the


Treasury,
 then
 I
 won't
 force
 him
 to
 be


the
 Fed
 chair.
 But
 whoever
 Trump's,
 you


know,
 whoever
 Trump
 is
 going
 to
 put
 into


that
 position
 is
 likely
 going
 to
 be
 on


his
 side
 of
 cutting
 rates,
 which
 means


even
 if
 they're
 hawkish
 for
 the
 first


half
 of
 the
 year,
 the
 back
 half
 of the


year,
 these
 rates
 are
 coming
 down,


whether
 it's
 Kevin
 Hassid
 or
 Kevin


Worish
 or
 uh
 or
 Bent.


And
 that
 might
 be
 the
 silver
 lining
 as


well
 for


a
 lot
 of
 investors
 that
 want
 lower


rates.
 Pounder
 there
 197
 and
 then
 Nvidia


207
 on
 the
 day.


Pablo,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 How


Heyid,
 how
 would
 you
 manage
 covered


calls
 for
 pounder?
 Strike
 200
 expiring


2026.
 When
 will
 you
 start
 to
 worry
 about


them


expiring
 January
 26?


I
 would
 definitely
 roll
 them
 before


earnings
 just
 because
 I
 do
 think
 there's


a
 shot
 that
 pounder
 is
 above
 earnings
 is


above
 200
 by
 earnings.
 I
 think
 you


should
 be
 able
 to
 get
 to
 like
 March
 230,


240,
 maybe
 pay
 a
 small
 debit
 or
 get
 a


credit.
 And
 that's
 a
 lot
 more
 manageable


than
 200
 going
 into
 January.
 And
 then
 if


if
 it
 if
 it
 gets
 hit
 on
 earnings,
 then


you
 can
 roll
 them
 down.
 If
 it
 goes
 up,


then
 you
 have
 more
 room.
 So
 I
 would
 get


out
 a
 couple
 months
 and
 try
 to
 get


another
 15
 20
 bucks
 there.
 UNH,
 why
 is


UNH
 dumping
 today,
 dude?
 UNH
 was
 almost


at
 390.
 Why
 is
 it
 down
 3%.


Did
 we
 have
 another
 healthcare
 company


report?
 UNH
 increased
 their
 EPS


guidance.
 They
 got
 a
 price
 target
 from


uh
 UBS
 to
 430
 and
 Morgan
 Stanley
 to
 411.


Very
 weird
 that
 this
 one's
 getting
 hit


today.


CNC
 was
 green
 off
 earnings
 last
 night
 as


well.
 CNC.


Yeah,
 that's
 weird,
 bro.
 CNC's
 up
 11.


CNC
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 issues
 this
 year.


They're
 up
 11.
 UNH
 decent
 earnings,
 got


the
 street
 estimates,
 and
 now
 the


stock's
 down
 three.


I
 mean,
 two
 upgrades
 from
 reputable


firms
 and
 still
 going
 down
 after


earnings
 is
 weird.
 But
 you
 might


honestly,
 bro,
 you
 might
 have
 some


people
 selling
 you
 an
 H
 to
 buy
 Nvidia.


Oh,
 CNC
 was
 in
 the
 morning.
 Okay,


gotcha.


Well,
 see
 any
 of
 these
 healthcare
 name
 I


mean
 Molina
 was
 the
 bad
 one
 last
 week


and
 I
 could
 understand
 how
 the
 whole


sector
 takes
 a
 hit
 off
 that
 but


CNC
 doing
 good
 definitely
 isn't
 bearish


for
 UNH
 grab
 right
 there
 at
 608.
 Google


still
 272.
 AMD


up
 1.5.
 S&P
 still
 green.
 We
 haven't
 gone


red
 today
 folks
 and
 if
 we
 went
 red
 it


was
 for
 a
 very
 small
 portion
 of
 time.


We've
 been
 pretty
 green
 the
 whole
 day.


The
 pivot
 away
 from
 QT
 is
 the
 most


important
 to
 be
 honest.
 Yes,
 I
 agree.
 I


think
 that's
 what
 the
 majority
 of
 the


questions
 are
 going
 to
 be
 about
 today


from
 uh
 from
 the
 press.
 Robin
 right


there
 146.


And
 again,
 they're
 not
 officially


starting
 QE,
 but
 they're
 stopping
 QT,


which
 is
 a
 form
 of
 QE.


And
 that
 is
 something
 that
 I
 think
 most


people
 are
 going
 to
 be
 very
 curious


about
 why
 exactly
 they're
 going
 that


way.
 How's
 Oaklo?
 Oaklo
 is
 still
 up.
 You


got
 plenty
 of
 names
 that
 are
 doing
 okay.


Iran,
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners.
 Iran
 is
 down.


They
 got
 downgraded
 today.
 Bit
 farms
 up


a
 little
 bit.


Disney
 flat.
 Dualingo
 getting
 just


destroyed.


And
 S&P
 is
 still
 green.


I
 mean,
 you
 are
 a
 QT.
 Thank
 you.
 I


appreciate
 that.
 So
 is
 JPAL.


So
 is
 JPAL.
 Open
 Door
 going
 down
 1.7%


down.


Is
 PayPal
 almost
 back
 to
 the
 60s?
 No


way,
 bro.
 Is
 it
 actually


60
 cents
 away
 from


goodness?


Well,
 again,
 it's
 either
 bottoming
 here


or
 it's
 not,
 but
 PayPal
 is
 there.
 Yes,


I'll
 be
 streaming
 POW
 speech.


JPAL
 just
 posted
 calls
 in
 the
 Discord.


I
 wonder
 how
 the
 market
 reacts
 once
 we


get
 his
 final
 statements
 because
 then


remember
 the
 other
 thing
 we
 got
 is
 is


Microsoft
 Met
 and
 Google.
 So,
 we're


gonna
 be
 here
 for
 the
 next
 few
 hours


after
 JPAL


and
 those
 three
 are
 definitely
 going
 to


have


a
 big
 impact.


Yeah,
 I
 thought
 people
 would
 love
 PayPal


for
 the
 dividend.
 I
 mean,
 Steve
 has
 been


talking
 about
 PayPal
 doing
 a
 dividend


for
 years.
 They
 finally
 did
 it.
 All


these
 dividend
 funds
 can
 finally
 buy
 it.


But
 it
 feels
 like
 the
 street
 wants


something
 a
 bit
 different,
 potentially


more
 in
 terms
 of
 growth


to
 figure
 out
 what's
 going
 on.


The
 Fed
 did
 say
 they're
 going
 to
 roll


over
 their
 mortgage
 back
 security


payments
 into
 buying
 Treasury
 bonds.


It's
 not
 exactly
 quantitative
 easing,


but
 it's
 it's
 it
 definitely
 feels


similar
 to
 it.
 I'm
 sure
 they're
 going
 to


get
 some
 questions
 on
 QE.
 And
 you
 know


what
 the
 biggest
 question
 is
 going
 to


be?
 The
 biggest
 question
 is
 going
 to
 be


why
 are
 you
 guys
 cutting
 rates
 or


engaging
 in
 stimulus
 when
 inflation
 just


came
 in
 at
 3%.
 And
 your
 target's
 at
 2%.


And
 instead
 of
 the
 Fed
 just
 raising


their
 target,
 which
 would
 have
 been
 the


smartest
 thing
 to
 do,
 I
 think
 a
 year


ago,
 because
 2%
 just
 seems
 unrealistic,


they're
 going
 to
 blame
 it
 on
 the
 labor


market.


And
 you
 should
 be
 blaming
 it
 on
 the


labor
 market.
 But
 if
 they
 had
 also
 just


not
 had
 this
 like
 2%
 arbitrary
 target,


they
 could
 have
 said,
 "No,
 inflation's


fine.
 We're
 at
 3%.


But
 the
 2%
 number
 has
 changed
 a
 lot
 of


dynamics.
 Let's
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 more


coverage
 on
 this
 and
 then
 JP
 Pal's
 going


to
 be
 live
 in
 about
 10
 minutes.


>> Terry
 in
 there
 and
 what
 you've
 heard


from
 our
 panelists
 so
 far.


>> So
 anything
 less
 than
 a
 cut
 would
 have


been
 a
 problem
 for
 the
 overall
 markets.


I
 think
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 Chair


Powell
 has
 done
 in
 May
 of
 2026.
 I
 think


you're
 going
 to
 see
 25
 basis
 point
 cut


every
 meeting
 that
 he's
 available
 to
 cut


25
 basis
 points.
 I
 don't
 think
 you'll


see
 a
 50.
 I
 think
 it
 it
 that
 allows
 him


to
 keep
 President
 Trump
 at
 bay
 or


criticism
 at
 bay,
 allows
 him
 to
 satisfy


the
 markets
 and
 allows
 him
 just
 think


about
 this.
 Every
 quarter
 point
 cut,
 you


know,
 the
 the
 debt
 is
 at
 historic
 highs.


Every
 quarter
 point
 cut
 saves
 the


government
 88
 billion
 dollar
 on
 an


annual
 basis
 to
 service
 that
 debt.


Sounds
 like
 a
 win
 to
 me.
 The
 markets


think
 it's
 a
 win.
 unemployment
 rate


should
 probably
 be
 higher
 if
 the
 full


participation
 rate
 is
 really
 moving
 in
 a


static
 flow
 going
 forward
 off
 of
 the


April
 tariff
 tantrum.


What
 rallied
 the
 most?
 The
 most


unprofitable
 companies,
 the
 unprofitable


companies
 rally
 the
 most.
 So,
 we're


starting
 to
 see
 sort
 of
 the
 uh
 the
 mega


cap
 tech
 take
 over
 leadership
 again.
 So,


I
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 go
 high
 and
 low.


You're
 going to
 go
 unprofitable


companies.
 You're
 going
 to
 go
 Russell


2000
 companies
 that
 are
 really
 relying


on
 variable
 rate
 debt
 financing,
 right?


30%
 of
 them
 rely
 on
 this
 monthto-month.


Tom,


>> I
 think
 I
 think
 we
 saw
 something
 to
 the


extent
 of
 that.
 I
 I
 believe
 it
 was
 from


Torston
 Slock
 over
 at
 Apollo
 showing
 the


Russell
 2000
 profitable
 versus


unprofitable
 and
 the
 performance
 gap


that
 we've
 seen
 with
 the
 outperformance


coming
 from
 the
 not
 profitable
 Russell


2000
 smaller
 cap
 companies
 over
 the


course
 of
 this
 kind
 of
 year.
 and
 it's


it's
 been
 expanding.
 My
 question
 then


though
 is
 we've
 talked
 about
 this


divergence
 and
 K-shaped
 recovery
 ever


since
 not
 just
 the
 pandemic
 but
 call
 it


the
 great
 financial
 crisis
 lows.


>> Something
 has
 to
 give
 at
 some
 point


because
 inflation
 is
 still
 a
 problem.


It's
 still
 out
 there.
 There
 doesn't
 feel


like
 there's
 a
 view
 that
 it
 could


percolate
 up
 again
 to
 the
 levels
 that
 we


saw
 at
 four
 decade
 highs
 at
 points
 over


the
 last
 three
 to
 four
 years.
 But
 it
 has


to
 still
 be
 a
 concern
 if
 you're
 a


central
 banker
 thinking
 about
 a
 cycle
 of


interest
 rate
 cuts.


>> And
 that's
 what
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 the


questions
 are
 going
 to
 be
 about
 today


because
 yes,
 the
 labor
 market
 matters,


but
 if
 inflation
 is
 1%
 above
 their


targets,
 even
 if
 it
 doesn't
 get
 back
 to


8%
 like
 it
 was
 in
 22,
 it
 still
 might
 not


justify
 the
 cut,
 which
 is
 what
 JPA
 is


gonna
 have
 to
 talk
 about
 today.
 Wow,


they
 have,
 dude,
 they
 have
 grabb
 on
 the


screen.


Look
 at
 that.


They
 actually
 have
 grabbed
 in
 the
 bottom


tickers.
 Oh,
 CNBC
 never
 has
 grabb.
 Look


at
 that.
 Grabs
 on
 the
 screen.
 They


usually
 never
 have
 it.


>> Is
 it
 not?
 Uh,
 correct.
 What
 would
 you


think
 though
 is
 more
 of
 a
 concern
 now?


And
 this
 is
 what
 the
 Fed
 is
 trying
 to
 to


weigh.
 Is
 it
 price
 stability
 or
 is
 it


full
 employment?
 And
 at
 this
 point,


we're
 at
 a
 juncture
 where
 it
 is
 full


employment.
 Reason
 why
 I
 say
 that
 is
 the


tariffs
 really
 do
 that
 onetime
 price


shock
 to
 the
 to
 the
 uh
 price
 of
 goods.


And
 you
 can't
 really
 get
 your
 head


around
 that,
 right?
 When
 you
 think
 about


it,
 tariffs
 are
 going
 higher.
 It's
 got


to
 be
 an
 ongoing
 basis.
 They
 only
 go
 up


once.
 They
 stay
 up
 once.
 So
 the
 the
 uh


amount
 of
 uh
 corporations
 that
 are


passing
 it
 on,
 that
 could
 be
 different.


But
 let's
 think
 about
 the
 the
 budget
 act


that
 President
 Trump
 passed.
 People
 are


going
 to
 get
 roughly
 per
 household


$2,000
 coming
 in
 the
 door
 with
 those
 tax


cuts.
 Tariffs
 are
 costing
 them
 roughly


$1,000
 per
 household.
 Great.
 You
 know,


these
 are
 averages.
 So,
 they're
 actually


above
 water
 on
 those
 tax
 policies.


>> So,
 that's
 where
 I
 think
 that's
 where
 I


think
 that
 most
 of
 the
 market
 is
 not


pricing
 in.
 And
 then
 the
 full
 expensing,


right?
 So
 that
 free
 cash
 flow,
 net


profits,
 those
 are
 all
 tailwinds
 to
 the


economy.
 But
 when
 you
 look
 at
 where


we're
 at
 now,
 look
 at
 the
 amount
 of


layoffs
 that
 we've
 seen
 in
 the
 last
 30


days


and
 white
 jobs
 thousands,


>> right?
 So
 if
 you're
 thinking
 where
 do
 I


want
 to
 really
 put
 my
 emphasis,
 it's
 on


jobs
 right
 now.
 It's
 not
 on
 tariffs.


We've
 already
 seen
 the
 bulk
 of
 inflation


on
 that.
 I'd
 rather
 place
 my
 bets
 on


cutting
 rates.
 And
 the
 2-year
 is
 lower


than
 the
 Fed
 funds
 rate.
 Does
 not
 happen


often,
 especially
 in
 a
 rate
 cutting


cycle.
 That
 2-year
 should
 be
 above
 where


the
 Fed
 funds
 rate
 is.
 And
 it's
 still


lower.
 So,
 I
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 see


us
 get
 back
 down
 to
 that
 neutral
 rate.


They
 think
 it's
 at
 3754.
 I
 think
 it's
 at


2753.


>> All
 right.


>> And
 the
 10ear
 as
 well,
 still
 above
 four.


I
 mean,
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 why


mortgage
 rates
 haven't
 really
 been


coming
 down.
 you
 need
 this
 10
 year


closer
 to
 3.7
 3.8.
 We
 did
 get
 a
 couple


of
 3.9
 closes
 over
 the
 past
 week.


Uh
 but
 as
 you
 can
 see,
 bond
 market


definitely
 selling
 off
 these
 bonds,


increasing
 these
 yields
 even
 with
 news


of
 the
 rate
 cut.


Five
 minutes.
 Five
 minutes.
 We're
 going


to
 see
 what
 happens.


Again,
 uh
 the
 cool
 thing
 about
 these


FOMC
 meetings
 is
 most
 of
 your
 friends
 or


family
 have
 no
 idea
 that
 there
 is
 a
 guy


called
 Jerome
 Pal
 who
 controls
 the
 fate


of
 the
 economy.
 I
 mean,
 quite
 literally,


he
 does.
 But
 all
 of
 us
 care
 as
 Google


hits
 all-time
 highs
 at
 273.


and
 we
 are
 all
 here
 together


to
 watch
 him
 stumble
 on
 every
 syllable


and
 try
 to
 figure
 out
 if
 we're
 going
 to


lose
 money
 or
 make
 money.
 Iran
 got


downgraded
 today
 by
 HC
 Wayne.
 They
 got
 a


$45
 downgrade.
 That's
 why
 that
 stock
 is


selling
 off.
 Why
 is
 Yeah,


I
 don't know.
 Look,
 the
 rate
 cuts
 are


bullish
 for
 SoFi
 long
 term.
 I
 guess
 in


the
 immediate
 term


SoFi
 is
 weird,
 dude.
 There's
 it's


it's
 above
 30,
 so
 no
 one
 can
 be
 upset.


Stock's
 up
 more
 than
 100%
 year
 to
 date,


but
 it
 just
 might
 need
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 a


boost
 to
 really
 make
 a
 more
 explosive


move.


3105
 down
 about
 2%


right
 now.


Uh


so
 that's
 what
 you've
 got
 on
 SoFi.


Nvidia
 still
 holding
 200s,
 not
 really


giving
 that
 up.
 Palanter
 still
 holding


the
 high
 190s.
 And
 then
 you
 got
 Amazon


at
 229.
 As
 he
 mentioned
 the
 uh
 the
 the


layoffs
 that
 are
 starting
 to
 increase,


you
 know,
 Amazon
 firing
 15,000
 people,


that
 becomes
 national
 news.
 So,
 I
 do


think
 JPL
 is
 also
 going
 to
 get
 questions


about
 those
 layoffs.
 And


we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 more


clarity
 on
 what
 he
 thinks
 the
 labor


market
 will
 look
 like.
 I
 mean,
 you
 got


some
 people
 that
 are
 probably
 going
 to


say,
 why
 aren't
 we
 cutting
 more
 than
 25


bips
 if
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 weakening
 as


much
 as
 it
 is?


So,
 that's
 also
 going to
 be
 important.


Did
 you
 see
 Elon's
 tweet

 I


did
 not.
 Let

You

 probably
 on


Kali.


Do
 they
 have

 again?


They
 probably
 have
 a

for
 this.
 They
 had
 one
 in
 the
 last

 did.
 Uh
 Elon,
 what
 did
 Elon


say?


Just
 saw
 this
 in
 a

 at

Alto.


It's
 pretty
 cool.
 Elon's
 getting
 a

more
 excited
 for
 what
 could
 happen
 with

when

All
 right,

He
 will
 be

 and
 we
 will
 all
 get


to

 Thank
 you


everybody
 for

 Five

 Doesn't
 even


feel

 Feels
 like
 it's


been
 barely
 five
 minutes
 as
 we've


analyzed


the

 all
 day.
 And
 then


right
 after
 this,
 we'll
 have
 some
 people


come
 on,
 help
 analyze
 what
 what
 pal
 just


said.
 And
 then
 we
 will
 have
 Meta,


Microsoft,
 and
 the
 Googs.
 So,
 it
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 pretty
 important
 day.
 Here


we
 go.
 Here
 is
 Mr.
 J.
 Pal.
 Drone
 Pal
 is


taking
 the
 podium
 as
 we
 speak.


>> Good
 afternoon.
 Um
 my
 colleagues
 and
 I


remain
 squarely
 focused
 on
 our
 achieving


our
 dualmandate
 goals
 of
 maximum


employment
 and
 stable
 prices
 for
 the


benefit
 of
 the
 American
 people.


Although
 some
 important
 federal


government
 data
 have
 been
 delayed
 due
 to


the
 shutdown,
 the
 public
 and
 private


sector
 data
 that
 have
 remained
 available


suggest
 that
 the
 outlook
 for
 employment


and
 inflation
 has
 not
 changed
 much
 since


our
 meeting
 in
 September.
 Conditions
 in


the
 labor
 market
 appear
 to
 be
 gradually


cooling
 and
 inflation
 remains
 somewhat


elevated.


In
 support
 of
 our
 goals
 and
 in
 light
 of


the
 balance
 of
 risks
 to
 employment
 and


inflation,
 today
 the
 Federal
 Open
 Market


Committee
 decided
 to
 lower
 our
 policy


interest
 rate
 by
 a
 quarter
 percentage


point.


We
 also
 decided
 to
 conclude
 the


reduction
 of
 our
 aggregate
 securities


holdings
 as
 of
 December
 1.
 I
 will
 have


more
 to
 say
 about
 monetary
 policy
 after


briefly
 reviewing
 economic
 developments.


Available
 indicators
 suggest
 that


economic
 activity
 has
 been
 expanding
 at


a
 moderate
 pace.
 GDP
 rose
 at
 a
 1.6%
 pace


in
 the
 first
 half
 of
 the
 year,
 down
 from


2.4%
 last
 year.


Data
 available
 prior
 to
 the
 shutdown


show
 that
 growth
 in
 economic
 activity


may
 be
 on
 a
 somewhat
 firmer
 trajectory


than
 expected,
 primarily
 reflecting


stronger
 consumer
 spending.


Business
 investment
 in
 equipment
 and


intangibles
 has
 continued
 to
 expand,


while
 activity
 in
 the
 housing
 sector


remains
 weak.


The
 shutdown
 of
 the
 federal
 government


will
 weigh
 on
 economic
 activity
 while
 it


persists.
 But
 these
 effects
 should


reverse
 after
 the
 shutdown
 ends.


In
 the
 labor
 market,
 the
 unemployment


rate
 remained
 relatively
 low
 through


August.


Job
 gains
 have
 slowed
 significantly


since
 earlier
 in
 the
 year.
 A
 good
 part


of
 the
 slowing
 likely
 reflects
 a
 decline


in
 the
 growth
 of
 the
 labor
 force
 due
 to


lower
 immigration
 and
 labor
 force


participation,
 though
 labor
 demand
 has


clearly
 softened
 as
 well.


Although
 official
 employment
 data
 for


September
 are
 delayed,
 available


evidence
 suggests
 that
 both
 layoffs
 and


hiring
 remain
 low
 and
 that
 both


households
 perceptions
 of
 job


availability
 and
 firms
 perceptions
 of


hiring
 difficulty
 continue
 to
 decline.


In
 this
 less
 dynamic
 and
 somewhat
 softer


labor
 market,
 the
 downside
 risks
 to


employment
 appear
 to
 have
 risen
 in


recent
 months.


Inflation
 has
 eased
 significantly
 from


its
 highs
 in
 mid
 2022,
 but
 remains


somewhat
 elevated
 relative
 to
 our
 2%


longerrun
 goal.


Estimates
 based
 on
 the
 consumer
 price


index
 suggest
 that
 total
 PCE
 prices
 rose


2.8%
 over
 the
 12
 months
 ending
 in


September
 and
 that
 excluding
 the


volatile
 food
 and
 energy
 categories,


core
 PCE
 prices
 rose
 2.8%
 as
 well.


These
 readings
 are
 higher
 than
 earlier


in
 the
 year
 as
 inflation
 for
 goods
 has


picked
 up.
 In
 contrast,
 disinflation


appears
 to
 be
 continuing
 for
 services.


Near-term
 measures
 of
 inflation


expectations
 have
 moved
 up
 on
 balance


over
 the
 course
 of
 this
 year
 on
 news


about
 tariffs
 as
 reflected
 in
 both


market
 and
 survey
 based
 measures.
 Beyond


the
 next
 year
 or
 two
 or
 so,
 however,


most
 measures
 of
 longerterm
 expectations


remain
 consistent
 with
 our
 2%
 inflation


goal.
 Our


monetary
 policy
 actions
 are
 guided
 by


our
 dual
 mandate
 to
 promote
 maximum


employment
 and
 stable
 prices
 for
 the


American
 people.
 At
 today's
 meeting,
 the


committee
 decided
 to
 lower
 the
 target


range
 for
 the
 federal
 funds
 rate
 by
 a


quarter
 percentage
 point
 to
 to
 3
 and
 3/4


to
 4%.


Higher
 tariffs
 are
 pushing
 up
 prices
 in


some
 categories
 of
 goods
 resulting
 in


higher
 overall
 inflation.


A
 reasonable
 base
 case
 is
 that
 the


effects
 on
 inflation
 will
 be
 relatively


short-lived,
 a
 one-time
 shift
 in
 the


price
 level.
 But
 it
 is
 also
 possible


that
 the
 inflationary
 effects
 could


instead
 be
 more
 persistent.
 And
 that
 is


a
 risk
 to
 be
 assessed
 and
 managed.
 Our


obligation
 is
 to
 ensure
 that
 a
 one-time


increase
 in
 the
 price
 level
 does
 not


become
 an
 ongoing
 inflation
 problem.


In
 the
 near
 term,
 risks
 to
 inflation
 are


tilted
 to
 the
 upside
 and
 risks
 to


employment
 to
 the
 downside.
 A


challenging
 situation.
 There
 is
 no


risk-free
 path
 for
 policy
 as
 we
 navigate


this
 tension
 between
 our
 employment
 and


inflation
 goals.
 Our
 framework
 calls
 for


us
 to
 take
 a
 balanced
 approach
 in


promoting
 both
 sides
 of
 our
 dual


mandate.


With
 downside
 risks
 to
 employment
 having


increased
 in
 recent
 months,
 the
 balance


of
 risks
 has
 shifted.
 Accordingly,
 we


judged
 it
 appropriate
 at
 this
 meeting
 to


take
 another
 step
 toward
 a
 more
 neutral


policy
 stance.


With
 today's
 decision,
 we
 remain
 well


positioned
 to
 respond
 in
 a
 timely
 way
 to


potential
 economic
 developments.


We
 will
 continue
 to
 determine
 the


appropriate
 stance
 of
 monetary
 policy


based
 on
 the
 incoming
 data,
 the
 evolving


outlook,
 and
 the
 balance
 of
 risks.
 We


continue
 to
 face
 two-sided
 risks


in
 the
 committee's
 discussions
 at
 this


meeting.
 There
 were
 strongly
 differing


views
 about
 how
 to
 proceed
 in
 December.


A
 further
 reduction
 in
 the
 policy
 rate


at
 the
 December
 meeting
 is
 not
 a


foregone
 conclusion.
 Far
 from
 it.
 Policy


is
 not
 on
 a
 preset
 course.


At
 today's
 meeting,
 the
 committee
 also


decided
 to
 conclude
 the
 reduction
 of
 our


aggregate
 securities
 holdings
 as
 of


December
 1.


Our
 long-stated
 plan
 has
 been
 to
 stop


balance
 sheet
 runoff
 when
 reserves
 are


somewhat
 above
 the
 level
 we
 judge


consistent
 with
 ample
 reserve


conditions.


Signs
 have
 clearly
 emerged
 that
 we
 have


reached
 that
 standard.


In
 money
 markets,
 repo
 rates
 have
 moved


up
 relative
 to
 our
 administered
 rates


and
 we
 have
 seen
 more
 notable
 pressures


on
 selected
 dates
 along
 with
 more
 use
 of


our
 standing
 repo
 facility.


In
 addition,
 the
 effective
 federal
 funds


rate
 has
 begun
 to
 move
 up
 relative
 to


the
 rate
 of
 interest
 on
 reserve


balances.
 These
 developments
 are
 what
 we


expected
 to
 see
 as
 the
 size
 of
 our


balance
 sheet
 declined
 and
 warrant


today's
 decision
 to
 cease
 runoff.


Over
 the
 three
 and
 a
 half
 years
 that


we've
 been
 shrinking
 our
 balance
 sheet,


our
 securities
 holdings
 have
 declined
 by


$2.2
 trillion.


As
 a
 share
 of
 nominal
 GDP,
 our
 balance


sheet
 has
 fallen
 from
 35%
 to
 about
 21%.


In
 December,
 we'll
 enter
 the
 next
 phase


of
 our
 normalization
 plans
 by
 holding


the
 size
 of
 our
 balance
 sheet
 steady
 for


a
 time
 while
 reserve
 balances
 continue


to
 move
 gradually
 lower
 as
 other


non-reserve
 liabilities
 such
 as
 currency


keep
 growing.


We
 will
 continue
 to
 allow
 agency


securities
 to
 run
 off
 our
 balance
 sheet


and
 we'll
 reinvest
 the
 proceeds
 from


those
 securities
 in
 Treasury
 bills,


furthering
 progress
 toward
 a
 portfolio


consisting
 primarily
 of
 Treasury


securities.
 This
 reinvestment
 strategy


will
 also
 help
 move
 the
 weighted
 average


maturity
 of
 our
 portfolio
 closer
 to
 that


of
 the
 outstanding
 stock
 of
 Treasury


securities,
 thus
 furthering
 the


normalization
 of
 the
 composition
 of
 our


balance
 sheet.


The
 Fed
 has
 been
 assigned
 two
 goals
 for


monetary
 policy.
 Maximum
 employment
 and


stable
 prices.
 We
 remain
 committed
 to


supporting
 max
 our
 maximum
 employment,


bringing
 our
 inflation
 sustainably
 to


our
 2%
 goal,
 and
 keeping
 longerterm


inflation
 expectations
 well
 anchored.


Our
 success
 in
 delivering
 on
 these
 goals


matters
 to
 all
 Americans.
 We
 understand


that
 our
 actions
 affect
 communities,


families,
 and
 businesses
 across
 the


country.
 Everything
 we
 do
 is
 in
 service


to
 our
 public
 mission.
 We
 at
 the
 Fed


will
 do
 everything
 we
 can
 to
 achieve
 our


maximum
 employment
 and
 price
 stability


goals.
 Thank
 you.
 I
 look
 forward
 to
 your


questions.


>> Markets
 red
 Q&A.


>> Nick
 Timmeros
 of
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal.
 Chair,
 are
 you
 uncomfortable


with
 how
 market
 pricing
 has
 assumed
 a


rate
 cut
 as
 a
 foregone
 conclusion
 at


your
 next
 meeting?
 Well,
 I
 as
 I
 just


mentioned,
 um
 a
 further
 reduction
 in
 the


policy
 rate
 of
 December
 meeting
 is
 not
 a


foregone
 conclusion
 as
 I've
 just
 said.


So,
 uh
 I
 would
 say
 that
 that
 needs
 to
 be


taken
 on
 board.
 We
 had
 um
 you
 know,
 I


would
 just
 say
 this
 uh
 19
 participants


on
 the
 committee.
 Everyone
 works
 very


hard
 at
 this
 and
 takes
 their
 obligations


to
 serve
 the
 American
 people
 very


seriously.
 And
 at
 a
 time
 when
 we
 have


tension
 between
 our
 our
 two
 goals,
 we


have
 uh
 you
 know
 strong
 views
 across
 the


committee
 and
 as
 I
 mentioned
 uh
 there


were
 strongly
 differing
 views
 today
 and


uh
 the
 takeaway
 from
 that
 is
 that
 we


haven't
 made
 a
 decision
 about
 December


and
 you
 know
 we're
 going to
 be
 looking


at
 the
 data
 that
 we
 have
 uh
 how
 that


affects
 the
 outlook
 and
 the
 balance
 of


risks
 and
 I'll
 just
 say
 that


>> you
 and
 some
 of
 your
 colleagues
 have


framed
 uh
 last
 month
 and
 maybe
 today
 uh


I
 won't
 quote
 you
 about
 there's
 a
 risk


management


exercise.
 At
 what
 point
 do
 you
 uh


conclude
 that
 you've
 taken
 out
 enough


insurance?
 Are
 you
 looking
 for
 some
 kind


of
 improvement
 in
 the
 outlook
 or
 could


this
 unfold
 along
 the
 lines
 of
 last
 year


where
 you
 made
 a
 sequence
 of
 adjustments


and
 then
 waited
 to
 gather
 more


information?
 So
 the
 way
 we
 have
 been


think
 way
 I've
 been
 thinking
 about
 it
 is


um
 the
 the
 the
 risks
 to
 the
 two
 goals


for
 a
 very
 long
 time
 the
 risk
 was


clearly
 of
 higher
 inflation
 and
 then


that
 has
 changed
 now
 and
 as
 we
 saw
 the


particularly
 after
 we
 saw
 after
 the
 July


meeting
 we
 saw
 the
 downward
 provisions


in
 job
 creation
 we
 saw
 a
 very
 different


picture
 of
 the
 labor
 market
 and


suggested
 that
 there
 were
 higher


downside
 risks
 to
 the
 labor
 market
 than


we
 had
 thought
 and
 that
 suggested
 that


policy
 which
 we
 had
 been
 holding
 at
 a
 at


a
 I
 would
 say
 modestly
 others
 people


would
 say
 moderately
 restrictive
 level


needed
 to
 move
 more
 in
 the
 direction


over
 time
 of
 neutral.
 If
 the
 two
 goals


are
 sort
 of
 equally
 at
 risk
 then
 you


ought
 to
 be
 at
 neutral
 because
 one
 of


them's
 calling
 for
 you
 to
 hike
 and
 one


of
 them
 is
 calling
 for
 you
 to
 cut.
 So
 if


that
 if
 that
 got
 back
 into
 balance
 then


you'd
 want
 to
 be
 roughly
 at
 neutral.
 So


in
 that
 sense
 it
 was
 a
 riskmanagement


uh
 and
 and
 I
 would
 say
 the
 same
 about


today
 sort
 of
 the
 same
 logic
 but
 as
 I


mentioned
 going
 forward
 is
 is
 a


different
 thing


>> CLA


>> um
 Cla
 Jones
 Financial
 Times.
 Um
 thank


you
 for
 taking
 this
 question.
 um
 you


know
 we
 we've
 we've
 we've
 just
 heard


from
 you
 that
 that
 the
 um
 the
 discussion


in
 December
 and
 the
 conclusion
 of
 the


discussion
 is
 not
 a
 foregone
 conclusion.


I'd
 like
 to
 just
 dig
 into
 that
 a
 little


bit
 more
 about
 what
 sort
 of
 arguments


were
 brought
 up
 was
 the
 any


consideration
 for
 instance
 of
 the


investment
 we're
 seeing
 in
 AI
 and
 some


of
 the
 the
 generation
 of
 household


wealth
 through
 rises
 in
 stock
 prices


related
 to
 the
 AI
 boom.
 Thank
 you.
 You


know,
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 that's
 a
 that's


that's
 a
 factor
 in
 everyone's
 assessment


of
 the
 economy.
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 it's
 the


driving
 factor,
 I
 don't
 think,
 for


anybody.
 You
 know,
 I
 guess
 I
 would
 say


it
 this
 way.
 Once
 again,
 I
 I
 would
 just


point
 out
 that
 we
 have
 the
 situation


where
 the
 risks
 are
 to
 the
 upside
 for


inflation
 and
 to
 to
 the
 downside
 for


employment.
 We
 have
 one
 tool.
 It
 can't


do
 both
 of
 those.
 So,
 you
 can't
 address


both
 of those
 at
 once.
 You've
 got
 a
 very


different
 situation.
 So,
 you
 have
 some


people
 people
 have
 different
 forecasts,


right?
 So
 they'll
 they'll
 they'll


they'll
 feel
 they'll
 forecast
 faster
 or


slower
 progress
 on
 one
 or
 the
 other.
 And


they
 also
 have
 different
 levels
 of
 risk


aversion
 and
 you
 know
 people
 some
 will


be
 more
 averse
 to
 inflation
 overruns
 and


some
 will
 be
 more
 averse
 to
 underruns
 of


employment.
 And
 so
 you
 put
 that
 together


and
 as
 you
 can
 see
 from
 the
 SCP
 and
 from


the
 public
 discussion
 that
 goes
 on


between
 the
 meetings
 when
 you


participants
 go
 out
 and
 talk
 they're


very
 disperate
 views
 and
 they
 were


reflected
 in
 strongly
 differing
 views
 in


today's
 meeting
 as
 I
 as
 I
 pointed
 out
 in


my
 remarks
 and
 that's
 what
 leads
 me
 to


say
 that
 you
 know
 that
 we
 haven't
 made
 a


decision
 about
 about
 December.
 You
 know,


I
 always
 say
 that
 it's
 a
 fact
 that
 we


don't
 make
 decisions
 in
 advance,
 but


this
 is
 I'm
 saying
 something
 in
 addition


here
 is
 that
 that
 it's
 not
 it's
 not
 to


be
 seen
 as
 a
 foregone
 conclusion.
 In


fact,
 far
 from
 it.


>> Can
 I
 just
 ask
 a
 quick
 follow
 up
 on
 QT?


How
 much
 of
 the
 um
 the
 the
 fund


impressions
 we've
 seen
 in
 money
 markets


are
 related
 to
 the
 US
 Treasury
 issue


more
 shortterm
 debt?
 you
 know,
 that


could
 be
 one
 of
 the
 factors,
 but
 the


reality
 is
 we've
 seen,
 you
 know,
 the


things
 that
 we've
 seen
 um
 higher
 repo


rates
 and
 federal
 funds
 rate
 moving
 up.


These
 are
 the
 very
 things
 that
 we've
 se


that
 we
 that
 we
 look
 for.
 We
 actually


have
 a
 a
 framework
 for
 looking
 at,
 you


know,
 what
 the
 place
 we're
 trying
 to


reach.
 But
 what
 we
 said
 for
 a
 long
 time


now
 is
 that
 when
 we
 uh
 feel
 like
 we're
 a


little
 bit
 or
 a
 bit
 above
 uh
 what
 we


consider
 a
 level
 that's
 ample
 that
 we


would
 freeze
 the
 size
 of
 the
 balance


sheet.
 Of
 course,
 reserves
 will
 continue


to
 decline
 from
 that
 point
 forward
 as


non-reserve
 liabilities
 grow.
 So,
 this


happened,
 some
 of
 it,
 some
 things
 have


been
 happening
 for
 some
 time
 now,


showing
 a
 gradual
 tightening
 in
 money


market
 conditions.
 Really,
 in
 the
 last,


call
 it
 3
 weeks
 or
 so,
 you've
 seen
 more


significant
 tightening
 and
 I
 think
 a


clear
 assessment
 that
 that
 we're
 at
 that


place.
 The
 other
 thing
 is,
 you
 know,


we're
 we're
 the
 balance
 sheet
 is


shrinking
 at
 a
 very
 very
 slow
 pace
 now.


we
 we've
 reduced
 it
 by
 half
 twice.
 Uh


and
 so
 there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 benefit
 to


be
 you
 know
 to
 be
 holding
 on
 for
 to
 get


the
 last
 few
 dollars
 because
 you
 know
 uh


again
 the
 balance
 sheets
 the
 reserves


are
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 shrink
 as


non-reserves
 grow.
 So,
 you
 know,
 there


was
 support
 on
 the
 committee
 uh
 as
 we


thought
 about
 it
 to
 go
 ahead
 with
 this


and
 and
 announce
 effective
 December
 1


that
 we
 will
 be,
 you
 know,
 freezing
 the


size
 of
 the
 balance
 sheet
 and
 that
 the


December
 1
 date
 gives
 the
 markets
 a


little
 bit
 of
 time
 to
 adapt.


>> Colby,


>> thank
 you.
 Colobby
 Smith
 with
 the
 New


York
 Times.
 So
 much
 of
 the
 rationale
 for


cutting
 interest
 rates
 even
 as
 inflation


moves
 away
 from
 the
 2%
 target
 seems
 to


be,
 you
 know,
 that
 there
 are
 these


mounting
 downside
 risks
 to
 the
 labor


market.
 But
 if
 those
 don't
 materialize


and
 the
 labor
 market
 either
 stabilizes


around
 current
 employment
 levels
 or
 even


starts
 to
 strengthen
 somewhat,
 how
 would


that
 change
 your
 perception
 of
 how
 much


interest
 rates
 need
 to
 fall
 from
 here?


Would
 you
 then
 be
 a
 bit
 more
 concerned


about
 underlying
 inflation
 and
 the


possibility
 of
 second
 round
 effects
 from


tariffs?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 in
 principle
 if
 if


you
 were
 to
 see
 data
 that
 suggested
 that


the
 labor
 market
 is
 strengthening
 or


even
 that
 it's
 stabilizing,
 you
 know,


that
 would
 certainly
 play
 into
 our


decisions
 going
 forward.
 So,
 and
 we
 do


have,
 you
 know,
 we
 get
 some
 data.
 The


labor
 market
 is
 a
 place
 where
 we
 get,


for
 example,
 we
 get
 the
 state
 level
 data


on
 initial
 claims
 which
 which
 are


sending
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 signal
 of
 more
 of


the
 same.
 We
 also
 get
 you
 job
 openings


um
 and
 we'll
 get
 lots
 of
 survey
 data.


We'll
 get
 the
 Beige
 book
 and
 things
 like


that.
 So,
 we'll
 have
 a
 we'll
 have
 a


picture
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 labor


market.
 And,
 you
 know,
 the
 fact
 that


we're
 not
 seeing
 an
 uptick
 in
 in
 claims


or
 a
 downtick
 really
 in
 openings
 um


suggests
 that
 you're
 seeing
 maybe
 maybe


continued
 very
 gradual
 cooling,
 but


nothing
 more
 than
 that.
 So,
 that
 does


give
 you
 some
 comfort.


But
 if
 this
 shutdown
 lasts
 a
 while


longer
 and
 you
 don't
 have
 that
 data
 in


hand,
 I
 I'm
 just
 wondering
 how
 that


hinders
 the
 committee's
 ability
 to


assess
 the
 state
 of
 the
 labor
 market
 and


make
 the
 right
 policy
 decisions
 and
 and


also
 how
 much
 is
 that
 factoring
 to
 the


into
 the
 debate
 about
 December?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 you
 know,
 we'll
 we
 get
 we
 get


like
 I
 mentioned
 what
 we
 get
 in
 the


labor
 area.
 We
 get
 some
 data
 in
 the
 in


inflation,
 some
 data
 in
 economic


activity.
 Um
 and
 we'll
 get
 we'll
 have
 a


picture
 of
 what's
 going
 on.
 And
 we
 also


will
 have
 the
 beige
 book.
 Again,
 uh
 I


would
 say
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


have
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 detailed
 feel
 uh


of
 of
 things,
 but
 I
 think
 if
 there
 were


a
 significant
 or
 material
 change
 in
 the


economy
 one
 way
 or
 another,
 I
 think
 we'd


I
 think
 we'd
 pick
 that
 up
 through
 this.


So,
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 it
 might
 affect


December,
 it's
 really
 hard
 to
 say.


December's
 uh
 you
 know,
 this
 the
 meeting


is
 I
 guess
 six
 weeks
 away.
 U
 we
 just


don't
 know
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 get.
 Um


if
 if
 there
 is
 a
 very
 high
 level
 of


uncertainty
 then
 you
 know
 it
 that
 could


be
 an
 argument
 in
 favor
 of
 caution
 about


moving
 but
 we'll
 have
 to
 see
 how
 it


unfolds.


>> Steve


>> Steve
 Leman
 CNBC


Mr.
 Chairman
 can
 you
 characterize
 the
 uh


the
 meeting
 in
 terms
 of
 you
 said


strongly
 differing
 views
 was
 a
 close


call
 this
 cut
 or
 was
 it
 a
 close
 call


maybe
 the
 other
 way
 because
 you
 had


dissents
 on
 both
 sides.
 Thanks.
 So
 I
 was


referring
 to
 uh
 the
 discussion
 about
 to


the
 extent
 it
 related
 to
 December.
 You


saw
 we
 had
 we
 had
 two
 descents,
 one
 for


50
 and
 one
 for
 no
 cut.
 So
 um
 you
 know


that
 was
 a
 strong
 solid
 vote
 in
 favor
 of


this
 cut.
 This
 the
 strongly
 u
 uh


differing
 views
 were
 really
 about
 about


the
 future.
 What
 does
 that
 look
 like?


And
 I
 think
 people
 are
 saying
 you
 know


they're
 they're
 noticing
 stronger


economic
 activity.
 you
 know
 forecasters


generally
 broadly
 have
 raised
 their


economic
 growth
 forecasts
 for
 this
 year


and
 next
 year
 in
 some
 cases
 quite


materially.
 Uh
 in
 the
 meantime
 we
 see


you
 know
 a
 labor
 market
 that's
 kind
 of
 I


don't
 want
 to
 say
 stable
 but
 it's
 it's


uh
 it's
 not
 clearly
 in
 motion
 not
 it's


not
 clearly
 declining
 quickly.
 In
 any


case,
 it
 may
 be
 just
 continuing
 to


gradually
 cool.
 And
 again,
 people
 have


different
 they
 have
 different
 forecasts


and
 expectations
 about
 the
 economy
 and


different
 different
 uh
 risk
 tolerances.


And
 so
 there's
 a
 you
 know,
 you
 read
 the


SCP,
 you
 read
 the
 speeches,
 you
 know,


there
 are
 different
 views
 on
 the


committee
 and
 and
 to
 the
 point
 where
 I


where
 I
 said
 what
 I
 said.
 And
 just
 to


follow
 up
 on
 the
 balance
 sheet,
 um,
 if


you
 stop
 it
 the
 runoff
 now,
 does
 that


mean
 you
 have
 to
 go
 back
 to
 actually


adding
 assets
 sometime
 next
 year
 so
 that


the
 balance
 sheet
 doesn't
 shrink
 as
 a


percentage
 of
 GDP
 and
 become
 a


tightening
 factor?


>> So,
 you're
 right.
 The
 the
 the
 place


we'll
 be
 on
 December
 1
 is
 that
 the
 size


of
 the
 balance
 sheet
 is
 frozen.
 And
 as


mortgage
 back
 securities
 mature,
 we'll


reinvest
 those
 in
 Treasury
 bills,
 which


will
 foster
 both
 a
 more
 treasury
 balance


sheet
 and
 also
 a
 shorter
 duration.
 So


that's
 what
 in
 the
 meantime,
 if
 you


freeze
 the
 size
 of
 the
 balance
 sheet,


the
 non-reserve
 liabilities,
 currency


for
 example,
 they're
 going
 to
 continue


to
 grow
 organically.
 And
 because
 the


size
 of
 the
 balance
 sheet
 is
 frozen,
 you


have
 further
 shrinkage
 in
 in
 reserves.


And
 reserves
 is
 the
 thing
 that
 we're


that
 we're
 managing
 that
 has
 to
 be


ample.
 So
 that'll
 happen
 for
 a
 time,
 but


not
 not
 a
 tremendously
 long
 time.
 We


don't
 know
 exactly
 how
 long,
 but
 at
 a


certain
 point,
 you'll
 want
 to
 start
 grow


you
 want
 to
 start
 reserves
 to
 start


gradually
 growing
 to
 keep
 up
 with,
 you


know,
 the
 size
 of
 the
 banking
 system
 and


the
 size
 of
 the
 economy.
 So
 we'll
 be


adding
 reserves
 at
 a
 certain
 point
 and


that's
 the
 that's
 the
 last
 point.
 Even


then,
 we'll
 be
 we'll
 be
 um
 we
 didn't


make
 decisions
 about
 this
 today,
 but
 you


we
 did
 talk
 today
 about
 the
 composition


of
 the
 balance
 sheet
 and
 there's
 a


desire
 that
 the
 that
 the
 balance
 sheet


be
 right
 now
 we
 where
 it
 it's
 it's
 got
 a


lot
 more
 duration
 than
 the
 outstanding


universe
 of
 Treasury
 securities
 and
 we


want
 to
 move
 to
 a
 place
 where
 we're


closer
 to
 that
 duration.
 That'll
 take


some
 time.
 We
 haven't
 made
 a
 decision


about
 the
 ultimate
 end
 point,
 but
 we
 all


agree
 that
 we
 want
 to
 move
 more
 in
 the


direction
 of
 a
 of
 a
 balance
 sheet
 that


more
 closely
 reflects
 the
 outstanding


treasuries
 and
 that
 means
 a
 shorter


duration
 uh
 balance
 sheet.
 Now,
 this
 is


something
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 take
 a
 long


time
 and
 move
 very
 very
 gradually.
 I


don't
 think
 you'll
 notice
 it
 in
 market


conditions,
 but
 but
 that's
 that's
 the


direction
 of
 things.


Johnell


>> Janelle
 Marte
 with
 Bloomberg.
 How
 are


officials
 interpreting
 the
 latest
 CPI


report?
 So
 some
 components
 came
 in
 lower


than
 expected
 but
 core
 inflation
 was


still
 at
 3%.
 So
 at
 this
 moment
 are
 what


what
 are
 you
 learning
 about
 the
 drivers


and
 also
 what
 are
 do
 you
 view
 that
 the


risks
 are
 greater
 that
 the
 Fed
 makes
 a


mistake
 on
 employment
 or
 inflation?


So
 okay
 so
 the
 September
 um
 CPI
 report


we
 didn't
 get
 PPI
 after
 that
 which
 is


which
 is
 important
 for
 translation
 into


what
 we
 look
 at
 which
 is
 PCE
 inflation


but
 we
 can
 still
 make
 a
 a
 pretty
 good


assessment
 of
 what
 that
 will
 be
 u
 when


we
 get
 PPI
 there
 might
 be
 some


adjustments
 but
 so
 directionally
 uh
 you


know
 it
 was
 a
 little
 softer
 than


expected
 and
 we
 always
 break
 it
 down


into
 the
 three
 components.
 So
 basically


um
 you've
 seen
 goods
 prices
 increasing


and
 that's
 really
 due
 to
 tariffs
 and


that's
 due
 that's
 in
 compared
 to
 a


longer
 run
 trend
 of
 very
 very
 mild


deflation
 in
 goods.
 So
 that's
 moving


inflation
 up.
 On
 the
 other
 side
 of
 that


good
 news
 that
 housing
 services


inflation
 has
 has
 been
 coming
 down
 and


is
 expected
 to
 continue
 to
 come
 down.
 So


if
 you
 remember
 a
 year
 a
 couple
 years


ago
 that's
 the
 one
 that
 just
 we
 kept


expecting
 it
 to
 to to
 do
 that.
 Now,
 it's


doing
 it's
 been
 doing
 that
 for
 some
 time


and
 we
 expect
 to
 continue
 that.
 That


leaves
 the
 the
 biggest
 category
 is


services
 other
 than
 housing
 services
 and


that's
 kind
 of
 been
 moving
 sideways
 uh


over
 the
 last
 few
 months,
 but
 a


significant
 part
 of
 that
 is
 uh


non-market
 services
 and
 we
 don't
 take
 a


lot
 of
 signal
 about
 the
 tightness
 of
 the


economy
 from
 that.
 So,
 if
 you
 add
 all


that
 up,
 a
 couple
 things
 to
 say.
 One
 is


that
 inflation
 away
 from
 tariffs
 is


actually
 not
 so
 far
 from
 our
 2%
 goal.
 We


we we
 estimate
 people
 have
 different


estimates
 of
 what
 that
 is,
 but
 it
 might


be,
 you
 know,
 five
 or
 six
 uh
 tents.
 And


so
 that,
 you
 know,
 if
 it's
 2.8,
 then


then,
 you
 know,
 uh
 core
 PCE
 not


including
 tariffs
 might
 be
 2.3
 or
 2.4
 in


that
 range,
 something
 like
 that.
 So


that's
 not
 so
 far
 from
 your
 goal.
 Um
 uh


so
 that
 we
 look
 at
 that
 and
 the
 the


thing
 about
 tariff
 inflation
 is
 the
 base


case
 is
 that
 it
 will
 come
 and
 it


probably
 will
 increase
 further
 but
 it
 is


that
 it
 will
 be
 a
 one-time
 increase.
 And


you
 know
 we've
 been
 very
 focused
 for
 all


of
 this
 year
 at
 making
 sure
 that
 that's


the
 case
 and
 thinking
 carefully
 about


what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the
 pathways


through
 which
 it
 could
 become
 something


else
 troublesome
 inflation.
 One
 of
 those


would
 be,
 you
 know,
 a
 really
 tight
 labor


market.
 We
 don't
 see
 that.
 Another
 could


be
 inflation
 expectations
 moving.
 We


don't
 see
 that.
 So,
 I
 think,
 you
 know,


we
 we're
 we're
 watching
 this
 very


carefully.
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 not
 the


case
 that
 we're
 just
 assuming
 that
 it's


going to
 be
 one-time
 inflation.
 We


understand
 fully
 that
 this
 is
 a
 risk
 we


have
 to
 monitor
 and
 ultimately
 manage.


>> With
 the
 stubborn
 services
 inflation,


what
 are
 some
 of
 the
 things
 that
 the
 Fed


could
 do
 to
 address
 that?
 Um
 and
 if


especially
 when
 we're
 seeing
 potentially


labor
 supply
 challenges.


>> Sorry,
 say
 say
 the
 first


>> the
 stubborn
 services
 inflation
 that
 you


>> service
 inflation.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 again,


the
 part
 of
 services
 inflation
 that
 is


that
 that
 isn't
 uh
 coming
 down
 as
 we


would
 like
 it
 to
 is
 the
 non-market
 part


of
 of
 um
 non-housing
 services.
 And
 you


know,
 overall
 that
 that's
 just
 something


that
 that
 we
 we
 expect
 will
 come
 down.


the
 non-housing
 the
 non-market
 part
 of


it
 should
 come
 down.
 It
 largely
 reflects


higher
 stock
 prices
 and
 and
 I
 mean
 a


financial
 services
 that
 are
 imputed


rather
 than
 actually
 paid
 is
 uh
 is
 a
 big


part
 of
 that.
 But
 also
 just
 you
 know
 we


think
 policy
 is
 still
 modestly


restrictive
 in
 my
 telling.
 So
 that's
 the


kind
 of
 thing
 that
 should
 lead
 to
 a


gradually
 cooling
 economy.
 That's
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 you
 see
 a
 gradually
 cooling


labor
 market
 is
 because
 you
 know
 the
 uh


Fed
 policy
 is
 modestly
 restrictive.
 So


that
 that
 that
 should
 also
 help
 get


that.
 I
 I
 want
 to
 say
 though,
 we're


absolutely
 committed
 to
 returning


inflation
 to
 2%.
 If
 you
 look
 at


longerterm
 surve
 surveys
 or
 market


pricing,
 you
 will
 see
 that
 that
 that's
 a


credible
 commitment
 and
 there
 there


should
 be
 no
 question
 that
 that's
 that


that's
 where
 we're
 going


>> Chris.


>> Great.
 Thank
 you.
 Uh
 Chris
 Raver
 at


Associated
 Press.
 So
 there's
 a
 big


investment
 boom
 in
 AI
 infrastructure


right
 now
 as
 you
 know
 and
 wondering
 if


the
 existence
 of
 such
 a
 boom
 u
 would


indicate
 that
 rates
 are
 not
 that


restrictive
 after
 all
 and
 could
 further


rate
 cuts
 at
 this
 point
 perhaps
 fuel
 an


excess
 level
 of
 investment
 there
 or
 uh


market
 bubbles.
 How
 is
 the
 Fed
 thinking


about
 that?


So
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 the
 uh


you're
 right
 there's
 a
 there
 are
 a
 lot


of
 data
 centers
 being
 built
 and
 other


investments
 being
 made
 around
 the


country
 and
 around
 the
 world.
 Um
 and
 uh


big
 US
 companies
 are
 just
 investing
 a


lot
 of
 resources
 in
 thinking
 about
 how


AI


which
 will
 be
 based
 on
 those
 data
 data


centers
 run
 through
 those
 data
 centers


is
 going
 to affect
 their
 businesses.
 So


it's
 a
 big
 deal.
 Um
 I
 don't
 think
 that


the
 spending
 uh
 that
 happens
 to
 build


data
 centers
 all
 over
 the
 country
 is


especially
 interest
 sensitive.
 It's


based
 on
 longer
 run
 it's
 you
 know
 longer


run
 assessments
 that
 this
 is
 an
 area


where
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of


investment
 and
 that's
 going
 to
 drive


higher
 productivity
 and
 that
 sorts
 of


things.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 those


investments
 will
 work
 out
 but
 I
 don't


think
 they're
 particularly
 interest


sensitive
 compared
 to
 some
 of
 the
 other


sectors.


And
 then
 just
 a
 quick
 followup,
 can
 you


you
 mentioned
 that
 you
 do
 have
 data
 that


you're
 looking
 at
 for
 inflation
 and


growth
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 government


data.
 Could
 you
 give
 us
 a
 sense?
 I
 think


we
 know
 a
 lot
 about
 the
 jobs
 data
 that's


out
 there.
 Can
 you
 give
 us
 a
 sense
 of


what
 you're
 looking
 at
 to
 track


inflation
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 government


data?
 Thank
 you.


>> So,
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 and
 it
 it


doesn't
 replace
 government
 data,
 but
 you


know,
 and
 you
 know,
 all
 of
 these
 uh


it's,
 you
 know,
 it's
 I'll
 just
 mention


some
 of
 the
 many
 many
 names,
 price


stats,
 uh
 Adobe
 and
 and
 others.
 uh
 uh


and
 and
 um
 for
 wage
 inflation,
 there's


ADP
 data.
 Um
 on
 spending,
 you're
 going


to
 ask
 about
 spending
 at
 some
 point.
 You


know,
 there
 are
 lots
 of
 other
 things


that
 we
 look
 at,
 but
 it's
 again,
 it's
 um


it's
 many
 u
 many
 different
 sources
 and


again
 including
 what
 we
 get
 out
 of
 the


of
 the
 the
 Beige
 book,
 which
 will
 be


sort
 of
 um
 come
 out
 midcycle
 as
 always.


And
 it
 doesn't
 doesn't
 replace
 uh
 the


government
 data,
 but
 it
 gives
 us
 a


picture.
 Again,
 I
 think
 if
 something


material
 were
 happening,
 if
 there
 were


material
 developments,
 I
 think
 we
 would


pick
 that
 up.
 I
 don't
 think
 we'll
 be


able
 to
 have
 the
 very
 the
 very
 granular


understanding
 of
 the
 economy
 uh
 while


this
 uh
 while
 this
 data
 is
 not


available.


>> Howard,


>> uh
 Howard
 Schneider
 with
 our
 Reuters.


Thank
 you.
 I
 just
 wanted
 you
 to


elaborate
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 what
 you
 said


a
 moment
 ago
 about
 about
 the
 lack
 a


continued
 shutdown
 making
 it
 more


difficult
 to
 make
 a
 move
 in
 December
 uh


and
 that
 may
 make
 you
 more
 cautious
 to


the
 degree
 you
 are
 relying
 on
 private


data
 that
 isn't
 the
 gold
 standard
 or


that
 you're
 relying
 on
 your
 own
 surveys


or
 the
 beige
 book.
 Do
 you
 worry
 at
 some


point
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 start


making
 policy
 by
 anecdote?


>> You
 know
 this
 is
 a
 temporary
 state
 of


affairs
 and
 you
 know
 we're
 going
 to
 do


our
 jobs.
 We're
 going
 to
 collect
 ev


every
 scrap
 of
 data
 we
 can
 find,


evaluate
 it,
 and
 think
 carefully
 about


it.
 And
 that's
 that's
 our
 job.
 So
 that's


what
 we're
 going
 to
 do.
 If
 you
 ask
 me,


could
 could
 it
 affect
 the
 the
 um
 you


know,
 the
 December
 meeting?
 I'm
 not


saying
 it's
 going
 to,
 but
 yeah,
 you


could
 imagine
 that
 that
 you
 know,
 what


do
 you
 do
 if
 what
 do
 you
 do
 in
 if
 you're


driving
 in
 the
 fog?
 You
 slow
 down.
 So


that
 that
 could
 or
 could
 not.
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 know
 how
 that's
 going
 to
 play
 into


things.


um
 we
 may
 get
 the
 data
 may
 come
 back,


but
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 possibility
 that


it
 would
 make
 sense
 to
 be
 more
 cautious


about
 moving.
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 committing


to
 that.
 I'm
 just
 saying
 it's
 certainly


a
 possibility
 that
 you
 would
 say


we
 we
 really
 can't
 see,
 so
 let's
 let's


slow
 down.


>> As
 as
 a
 followup
 in
 the
 debate
 on
 this


meeting,
 uh
 we
 saw
 recently
 uh
 some


pretty
 big
 layoff
 announcements
 coming


from
 from
 Amazon
 and
 others.
 uh


wondering
 if
 that
 figured
 into
 the


discussion
 at
 all
 that
 you're
 starting


to
 see
 the
 turn
 this
 tension
 between


growth
 and
 employment
 starting
 to
 be


resolved
 you
 know
 to
 the
 detriment
 of


employment.
 Uh
 and
 secondly
 uh
 some
 of


the
 stress
 is
 starting
 to
 appear
 in
 the


the
 bottom
 spur
 of
 the
 K
 as
 they
 call
 it


uh
 household
 uh
 health
 premiums
 that
 are


going
 to
 be
 possibly
 be
 going
 up
 quite


substantially
 things
 like
 that.
 Has
 that


started
 to
 become
 a
 factor
 in
 your


policy
 discussion?
 So
 those
 are
 those


are
 both
 things
 uh
 you
 know
 that
 we're


watching
 very
 very
 very
 carefully
 to
 to


start
 with
 uh
 the
 layoffs.
 You're
 right.


You
 see


a
 a
 significant
 number
 of
 companies


either
 announcing
 that
 they
 are
 not


going
 to
 be
 doing
 much
 hiring
 or


actually
 doing
 layoffs
 and


much
 of
 the
 time
 they're
 talking
 about


AI
 and
 what
 it
 can
 do.
 So,
 we're


watching
 that
 very
 carefully
 in
 and
 you


know,
 yes,
 it
 could
 absolutely
 have


implications
 for
 job
 creation.
 We
 don't


really
 see
 it
 in
 the
 um
 in
 the
 initial


claims
 data
 yet.
 Now,
 it's
 not
 a


surprise
 that
 we
 don't.
 It
 takes
 some


time
 for
 it
 to
 get
 in
 there,
 but
 we're


watching
 that
 that
 really
 carefully.
 Um


but
 again,
 don't
 don't
 see
 it
 yet
 in
 the


in
 the
 um
 in
 the
 in
 the
 initial
 claims


data.
 on
 on
 the
 the
 K-shaped
 economy


thing,
 I
 would
 say
 the
 same
 thing
 or


similar
 thing.
 We
 are
 uh
 if
 you
 if
 you


listen
 to
 the
 earnings
 calls
 or
 the


reports
 of
 you
 know
 big
 public


consumer-f
 facing
 companies
 many
 many
 of


them
 are
 are
 saying
 that
 there's
 a


bifurcated
 economy
 there
 and
 that
 um


consumers
 at
 the
 lower
 end
 are


struggling
 and
 buying
 less
 and
 shifting


to
 lower
 cost
 products
 but
 that
 at
 the


top
 people
 are
 spending
 at
 the
 higher


income
 and
 wealth
 and
 there
 you
 so
 much


much
 uh
 an
 anecdotal
 data
 on
 that
 and
 so


we
 think
 there's
 something
 there.
 Um


so


>> Edward,


>> thank
 you.
 Edward
 Lawrence
 with
 um
 Fox


Business.
 Uh
 so
 Mr.
 Chairman,
 I
 want
 to


take
 another
 crack
 at
 the
 at
 the
 uh


further
 um
 reduction
 in
 rates
 is
 not
 a


foregone
 conclusion.
 So
 in
 December,
 he


said
 far
 from
 it.
 So
 if
 a
 cut
 might
 not


be
 on
 the
 table
 for
 December
 because
 of


lack
 of
 data,
 what
 does
 the
 other


concerns
 then
 stem
 from?


So
 if
 it's
 not
 lack
 of
 data
 as
 as
 the


reason
 December
 is
 is
 not
 a
 foregone


conclusion,
 what
 other
 things
 could
 be


the
 concern
 then?


>> Well,
 perspectives
 on
 PE
 of
 people
 on


the
 committee
 that
 you
 know
 we've
 now


moved
 150
 basis
 points
 and
 that
 we're


down
 into
 you
 know
 you're
 into
 the
 that


range
 between
 three
 and
 four
 where
 most


estimates
 of
 many
 estimates
 of
 the


neutral
 rate
 live
 in
 that
 3
 to
 4%
 area.


You're
 there
 now.
 you're
 you're
 above


the
 median
 number
 for
 the
 committee,
 but


I
 think
 there
 are
 people
 on
 the


committee
 who
 have
 higher
 estimates
 of


the
 neutral
 rate,
 and
 that's
 a
 you
 know,


you
 can
 argue
 these
 positions
 since
 it


can't
 be
 directly
 observed
 the
 neutral


rate.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 think
 for
 for


for


some
 part
 of
 the
 committee,
 you
 know,


it's
 time
 to
 maybe
 take
 a
 step
 back
 and


and
 uh
 and
 and
 see
 whether
 there
 there


really
 are
 uh
 downside
 risks
 to
 the


labor
 market
 or
 see
 whether
 in
 fact
 the


the
 growth
 uh
 that
 the
 stronger
 growth


that
 we're
 seeing
 is
 is
 real.
 Um


ordinarily
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 a
 better


indicator
 of
 the
 momentum
 of
 the
 economy


than
 the
 spending
 data.
 That's
 the
 lore


in
 this
 case
 that
 gives
 a
 more
 downbeat


read.
 Um
 so
 people
 just
 have
 you
 know


there
 again
 we've
 cut
 50
 more
 basis


points
 um
 in
 the
 last
 two
 meetings
 and


there
 was
 a
 sense
 like
 let's
 from
 some


let's
 let's
 let's
 pause
 here
 kind
 of


thing
 and
 a
 sense
 from
 others
 wanting
 to


go
 ahead
 but
 that's
 why
 I
 say
 um


differing
 views
 strongly
 differing


views.
 So
 on
 that
 division
 then
 you're


talking
 about
 uh
 going
 forward.
 So


what's
 more
 important
 to
 in
 this


division?
 Is
 it
 inflation
 risks?
 Is
 it


employment
 risk?
 Or
 is
 is
 there
 a
 deeper


philosophy
 division
 among
 the
 board?


>> I
 I
 look
 everybody
 on
 the
 committee
 is


deeply
 committed
 to
 doing
 the
 right


thing
 to
 achieve
 our
 goals
 maximum


employment
 and
 stable
 prices.
 you
 have


differences
 on
 how
 to
 do
 that
 and
 as
 I


mentioned
 some
 of
 that
 is
 different


forecasts
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 also
 um


different
 risk
 aversions
 to
 the


different
 two
 to
 two
 different
 variables


which
 is
 common
 through
 you
 know
 through


all
 federal
 reserves
 there
 they're


people
 just
 have
 different
 risk


tolerances
 let's
 say
 so
 that
 leads
 you


to
 people
 with
 disperate
 views
 you
 will


know
 that
 from
 the
 speeches
 you've
 been


listening
 to
 from
 my
 colleagues
 and
 uh


and
 so
 we're
 at
 a
 place
 now
 where
 we


have
 in
 fact
 cut
 two
 more
 times


And
 you
 know,
 we're
 now
 we're
 150
 basis


points
 closer
 to
 neutral,
 wherever
 that


may
 be,
 than
 we
 were
 a
 year
 ago.
 And
 so


there's
 there's
 a
 growing
 chorus
 now
 of


of
 feeling
 like
 maybe
 this
 is
 where
 we


should
 at least
 wait
 a
 cycle,
 something


like
 that.
 That's
 that's
 what
 it
 is.


It's
 just
 what
 you
 think
 it
 would
 be.


It's
 and
 again,
 you've
 seen
 it
 in
 in
 the


uh
 the
 September
 summer
 of
 economic


projections.
 You've
 seen
 this
 in
 in
 the


public
 remarks
 of
 FOMC
 participants.
 and


and
 now
 I'm
 telling
 you
 that's
 what


that's
 what
 you
 can
 expect
 that
 in
 the


minutes
 and
 um
 I'm
 just
 telling
 you


that's
 what
 happened
 in
 the
 meeting.


>> Elizabeth,


>> thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Liza
 Schelsey
 with


ABC
 News.
 Uh
 what
 is
 your
 explanation


for
 why
 the
 job
 market
 is
 weakening


right
 now
 and
 what
 will
 this
 rate
 cut
 do


to
 improve
 the
 job
 market?


>> Big
 question.
 Labor
 market.
 I
 think
 the


um
 there
 are
 two
 things
 affecting
 the


job
 market
 and
 one
 of
 them
 is
 just
 a


dramatic
 reduction
 in
 the
 supply
 of
 new


workers.
 So
 and
 that's
 two
 things
 that's


uh
 declining
 labor
 force
 participation


which
 is
 a
 cyclical
 thing
 and
 then


there's
 declining
 immigration
 which
 is


just
 a
 big
 policy
 change
 that
 actually


began
 in
 the
 last
 administration
 and
 it


has
 been
 accelerated
 now.
 So
 a
 big
 part


of
 the
 whole
 story
 is
 that
 that
 supply


side
 story.
 Okay.
 In
 addition,
 labor


demand
 has
 declined
 and
 and
 you
 know
 the


so
 the
 labor
 the
 unemployment
 rate
 has


gone
 down
 meaning
 that
 demand
 for


workers
 has
 gone
 down
 a
 little
 more
 than


supply.
 So
 um
 that's
 that's
 what's
 going


on
 and
 but
 it
 is
 mostly
 a
 supply


function
 a
 you
 know
 it's
 mostly
 a


function
 of
 of
 the
 change
 in
 supply
 I


think
 and
 many
 people
 think.
 So
 the


question
 then
 is
 what
 does
 what
 does
 the


um
 you
 know
 our
 tool
 do
 which
 supports


demand
 and
 you
 know
 so
 and
 I
 would
 just


say
 when
 you're
 when
 you're
 in
 a


situation
 where
 job
 job
 creation
 if
 you


adjust
 for
 likely
 overounting
 in
 the
 way


that
 BLS
 does
 its
 work
 is
 pretty
 close


to
 zero.
 So
 maximum
 employment
 doesn't


on
 a
 sustainable
 basis
 doesn't
 if
 it's


if
 you're
 making
 creating
 zero
 jobs
 if


it's
 in
 equilibrium
 if
 it's
 if
 it's
 in


balance
 it's
 a
 pretty
 as
 I
 as
 I
 said


before
 a
 pretty
 curious
 balance
 so
 you


know
 I
 thought
 and
 many
 of
 my
 colleagues


thought
 in
 fact
 you've
 seen
 the
 last
 two


meetings
 that
 it
 was
 appropriate
 for
 us


to
 react
 by
 supporting
 demand
 with
 our


with
 our
 uh
 rates
 and
 we've
 done
 that


we've
 we've
 reduced
 so
 that
 rates
 are


looser
 there
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 that
 they're


accommodative
 right
 now,
 but
 they're


meaningfully
 less
 tight
 than
 they
 were.


And
 that
 should
 help
 um
 so
 that
 at least


the
 labor
 market
 doesn't
 doesn't
 get


worse.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 a
 complicated


situation.
 And
 and
 some
 people
 argue


that
 that
 this
 is
 supply
 and
 we
 really


can't
 affect
 it
 much
 with
 our
 tools.
 But


others
 argue,
 as
 I
 do,
 that
 that
 there


is
 an
 effect
 from
 demand
 and
 that
 that


we
 should
 use
 our
 tools
 to
 support
 the


labor
 market
 when
 we
 see
 this
 happening.


>> You
 also
 talked
 about
 tariffs
 causing
 a


one-time
 price
 increase.
 Should
 American


households
 consumers
 expect
 that


inflation
 will
 continue
 to
 go
 up
 this


year
 because
 of
 those
 tariffs?


>> So
 the
 the
 basic
 expectation
 is
 that


there
 will
 be
 some
 additional
 increase


inflation
 because
 it
 takes
 a
 while
 for


tariffs
 to
 work
 their
 way
 through
 the


through
 the
 production
 chain
 and
 finally


get
 to
 consumers.
 And
 we
 see
 this
 now


from
 the
 from
 the
 tariffs
 that
 were
 put


in
 place
 now
 many
 months
 ago.
 We
 see


those
 effects.
 But
 if
 you
 put
 tariffs
 in


effect
 and
 they've
 been
 coming
 into


effect
 consistently
 in,
 you
 know,


February,
 March,
 April,
 May,
 and
 that's


all
 happening.
 So
 that'll
 continue
 to


happen
 for
 some
 time,
 probably
 into
 the


spring.
 These
 are
 not
 big
 increases,


though.
 These
 are
 a
 tenth
 or
 so
 on


inflation.
 They
 may
 be
 big
 increases
 on


a
 particular
 product
 that's
 been


tariffed.
 But
 overall,
 these
 are
 fairly


modest.
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 some


projections
 go
 we're
 2.8%
 inflation.
 You


might
 get
 two
 or
 three
 more
 tents
 or


four
 more
 tents
 maybe.
 But
 then
 as
 as


all
 the
 tariffs
 are
 in,
 they
 stop


generating
 inflation.
 You've
 had
 a


one-time
 price
 increase.
 As
 long
 as


you're
 not,
 at least
 this
 is
 this
 is
 the


theory.
 This
 is
 how
 we
 believe
 and
 hope


that
 it
 will
 work
 out.
 Once
 there
 once


the
 last
 tariff
 is
 is
 put
 on
 something,


at
 that
 point
 it
 becomes
 it
 becomes
 a


higher
 price
 level,
 but
 it's
 it
 stops


going
 up,
 if
 you
 will.
 Prices
 stop
 going


up,
 they'll
 just
 be
 at
 that
 level.
 And


then
 measured
 inflation
 will
 come
 back


down
 to
 non-tariff
 inflation.
 As
 I


mentioned,
 non-tariff
 inflation
 is
 not


so
 far
 from
 2%.
 Now,
 now
 consumers
 don't


are
 not
 interested
 in
 that
 story.
 Their


their
 prices
 are
 higher.
 More
 than
 that,


the
 reason
 they're
 so
 unhappy
 about


inflation
 is
 the
 inflation
 that
 we
 had


in
 2021
 2
 and
 three
 because,
 you
 know,


you
 can
 say
 that
 prices
 aren't
 going
 up


as
 much,
 but
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 people


aren't
 feeling
 those
 higher
 prices
 from


the
 inflation
 we
 had
 two
 or
 three
 years


ago.
 They
 are.
 And
 that's
 I
 think
 a


large
 part
 of
 why
 the
 public
 views


sample
 people.
 Inflation
 is
 still
 very


much
 making
 people
 quite
 unhappy
 even


you
 know
 and
 it's
 nice
 that
 you
 know


that
 that
 prices
 are
 are
 not
 going
 up
 as


fast
 as
 they
 were
 but
 they're
 still
 much


higher
 than
 they
 were
 and
 it'll
 take


some
 time
 for
 that
 effect
 to
 wear
 off.


As
 real
 incomes
 rise
 it
 will
 feel
 better


over
 time
 but
 that's
 going
 to
 take
 time.


Mike,


>> Michael
 McKe
 from
 Bloomberg
 Television


Radio.
 Uh,
 do
 you
 have
 any
 concerns
 that


equity
 markets
 are
 or
 are
 close
 to
 being


overvalued
 at
 this
 point?


>> You
 know,
 we
 we
 don't
 look
 at
 any
 one


asset
 price
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 that's


wrong."
 You
 know,
 that's
 it's
 not
 our


job
 to
 do
 that.
 We
 look
 at
 the
 overall


uh
 financial
 system
 and
 we
 ask
 whether


it's
 stable,
 whether
 it
 could
 withstand


shocks.
 Right?
 So
 uh
 you
 know
 banks
 are


well
 capitalized
 while
 some
 households


are
 clearly
 under
 stress
 in
 the


aggregate
 the
 you
 know
 households
 are


are
 in
 good
 shape
 financially
 relatively


you
 know
 relatively
 manageable
 uh
 levels


of
 debt
 I
 at
 the
 at
 the
 lower
 income


spectrum
 you
 are
 seeing
 rising
 defaults


particularly
 around
 subprime
 auto
 but


nonetheless
 in
 the
 aggregate
 pretty
 good


um
 and
 uh
 you
 don't
 see
 so
 you
 don't
 see


too
 much
 leverage
 in
 the
 banking
 system


or
 the
 financial
 system
 it's
 a
 mixed


picture,
 but
 it's
 not
 an
 over
 overly


troubling
 picture.
 And
 again,
 I'm
 not


I
 it's
 not
 appropriate.
 You
 know,
 we


don't
 we
 don't
 set
 asset
 prices.
 Markets


do
 that.
 Well,
 are
 you
 you
 must
 be
 well


aware
 that
 by
 lowering
 interest
 rates,


you're
 contributing
 to
 additional
 uh


asset
 price
 uh
 increases.
 And
 I
 wonder


how
 you
 balance
 the
 idea
 that
 lowering


rates
 would
 help
 the
 labor
 market
 with


the
 reality
 that
 uh
 it
 seems
 more
 likely


to
 be
 stimulating
 increased
 investment


in
 AI,
 which
 is
 the
 rationale
 for


thousands
 of
 job
 cuts
 that
 have
 been


announced
 in
 the
 last
 few
 weeks.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 interest


rates
 are
 an
 important
 part
 of
 the
 AI
 of


the
 data
 center
 story.
 I
 I
 think
 you


know
 people
 think
 they're
 great


economics
 in
 building
 these
 data
 centers


and
 they're
 making
 a
 lot
 of
 money


building
 them
 and
 they
 think
 they
 have


very
 high
 present
 value
 and
 all
 that


sort
 of
 thing.
 It's
 not
 it's
 not
 really


about
 it's
 not
 a
 it's
 not
 you
 know
 about


25
 basis
 points
 here
 or
 there.
 Um
 you


know
 we
 use
 our
 tools
 to
 support
 the


labor
 market
 and
 to
 create
 uh
 price


stability.
 That's
 what
 we
 do.
 That's
 our


two
 jobs,
 right?
 So
 we're
 here
 to
 by
 by


lowering
 rates
 at
 the
 margin
 that
 will


support
 demand
 and
 that
 will
 support


more
 hiring
 and
 that's
 why
 we
 do
 it.
 Now


no
 25
 basis
 point
 or
 even
 50
 basis
 point


hike
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 dispositive
 thing


but
 ultimately
 uh
 you
 know
 lower
 rates


will
 support
 more
 demand
 and
 that'll


that'll
 support
 hiring
 overtime.
 And
 of


course
 we
 we
 also
 have
 to
 be
 careful


about
 this
 which
 is
 what
 we've
 been


doing
 because
 we
 we
 know
 where
 inflation


is
 and
 we
 know
 that
 you
 know
 I've
 told


you
 the
 story.
 It's
 complicated
 story


but
 this
 is
 the
 best
 assessment
 that
 we


can
 make
 and
 um
 and
 it
 but
 you
 know
 be


because
 there's
 uncertainty
 around


around
 inflation
 and
 the
 path
 ahead
 for


inflation.
 That's
 why
 we're
 going
 that's


why
 we
 we
 the
 pace
 we're
 going
 has
 been


a
 careful
 one.


>> Victoria


Hi,
 Victoria
 Guita
 from
 Politico.
 Um,
 on


AI,
 I'm
 just
 wondering,
 you
 know,
 it


seems
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 economic
 growth


that
 we've
 been
 seeing
 is
 fed
 by


investments
 in
 AI.
 So,
 how
 worried
 are


you
 about
 what
 a
 sudden
 contraction
 in


tech
 investment
 would
 mean
 for
 the


overall
 economy?
 Is
 there
 enough


strength
 in
 other
 sectors?
 And,
 um,


specifically,
 are
 there
 are
 there
 any


lessons
 that
 you
 take
 from
 the
 1990s
 in


in
 how
 you
 might
 uh
 approach
 what's


happening
 right
 now?


>> Yeah,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 different.
 um
 in


the
 sense
 that
 these
 companies
 the


companies
 that
 are
 so
 highly
 valued


actually
 have
 earnings
 and
 stuff
 like


that.
 So
 if
 you
 go
 back
 to
 the
 90s
 and


the
 dotcom
 they
 were
 these
 were
 ideas


rather
 than
 companies
 and
 you
 know
 we're


we're
 so
 there's
 a
 clear
 bubble
 there


whereas
 the
 you
 know
 the
 I
 won't
 go
 into


particular
 names
 but
 they
 actually
 have


earnings
 and
 you
 know
 you
 it
 looks
 like


they
 have
 business
 models
 and
 uh
 and


profits
 and
 that
 kind
 of
 thing.
 So
 it's


it's
 really
 a
 different
 thing.
 um
 you


know
 it's
 the
 the
 investment
 we're


getting
 in
 um
 equipment
 and
 in
 all
 those


things
 that
 go
 into
 creating
 data


centers
 and
 and
 feeding
 the
 AI
 it's


clearly
 part
 one
 of
 the
 big
 sources
 of


growth
 in
 the
 economy.
 Consumer
 spending


also
 though
 has
 been
 you
 know
 is
 is
 much


bigger
 than
 that
 and
 has
 been
 growing


and
 and
 has
 defied
 um
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 you


know
 negative
 forecasts
 continuing
 to
 do


so
 this
 year.
 consumers
 are
 still


spending.
 Now,
 it
 is
 it
 it
 may
 it
 may
 be


mostly
 higherend
 consumers
 or
 maybe


skewed
 that
 way,
 but
 the
 consumer
 is


spending
 and
 that's
 a
 big
 big
 chunk
 of


of
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 economy,


bigger
 than
 substantially
 bigger
 than


AI.
 You
 could
 point
 to
 the
 to
 growth.
 I


mean
 actually
 uh
 you
 may
 be
 growth
 as


opposed
 to
 level,
 but
 consumer
 spending


is
 a
 much
 bigger
 part
 of
 the
 economy.


>> And
 why
 do
 you
 think
 that
 the
 labor


market
 is
 slowing
 so
 much
 even
 though


consumer
 spending
 is
 strong?


>> Why
 has
 it
 slowed
 so
 much?
 Well,
 what's


happened
 is
 is
 that
 the
 supply
 of


workers
 has
 dropped
 very
 very
 sharply


due
 to
 mainly
 immigration
 but
 also
 lower


labor
 force
 participation.
 So,
 um
 and


and
 that
 means
 there's
 less
 need
 for
 new


jobs
 because
 there's
 there's
 there
 isn't


this
 flow
 into
 the
 into
 the
 pool
 of


labor
 that
 you
 know
 where
 people
 need


jobs
 because
 those
 there
 aren't
 those


people
 now.
 So,
 there's
 not
 a
 supply
 of


workers
 showing
 up
 for
 jobs.
 In


addition,
 demand
 has
 also
 gone
 down
 and


so
 has
 labor
 force
 participation
 has


declined,
 which
 is
 more
 of
 a
 sign
 in


this
 case
 of
 of
 uh
 of
 demand
 as
 well
 as


trend.
 So
 I
 think
 you're
 seeing
 some


softening.
 You
 know,
 the
 the
 economy
 is


growing
 at
 a
 slower
 rate
 than
 it
 was


2.4%
 last
 year.
 We
 think
 around
 1.6%


this
 year.
 It
 could
 have
 been
 a
 couple


of
 ten
 higher
 if
 not
 for
 the
 shutdown.
 U


and
 of
 course
 that
 will
 reverse.
 But
 uh


uh
 you
 know,
 you
 still
 got
 the
 economy


growing
 at
 a
 moderate
 pace.


>> Andrew,


hey
 there,
 Andrew
 Akerman
 with
 the
 with


the
 Washington
 Post.
 Um
 I
 wanted
 to
 ask


if
 you
 could
 elaborate
 on
 how
 you
 think


about
 policy
 in
 the
 context
 of
 the
 data


drought.
 Um,
 does
 it
 make
 you
 inclined


to
 stick
 with
 your
 plans
 as
 set
 out
 in


September
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 the
 data


that
 might
 change
 your
 mind
 or
 does
 it


make
 you
 inclined
 to
 proceed
 with
 added


caution
 because
 of
 uncertainty?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 we'll
 we'll
 know
 when
 we


face
 that
 question
 if
 we
 face
 that


question.
 I
 you
 know,
 it'll
 probably
 be


argued
 both
 ways,
 right?
 But
 I
 I
 I've


said
 a
 couple
 times
 here
 that,
 you
 know,


if
 you
 if
 you
 really
 aren't
 getting


information
 you
 really
 don't
 know
 and


the
 economy
 looks
 like
 it's
 solid
 and


stable
 and
 hasn't
 really
 changed,
 you


know,
 there
 will
 be
 an
 argument.
 I
 don't


know
 how
 persuasive
 it
 will
 be,
 but


there
 will
 be
 an
 argument
 that
 um
 you


know,
 you
 slow
 down
 in
 a
 in
 an
 when
 you


can't
 see
 as
 as
 far
 ahead.
 Um,
 others


may
 argue,
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 not
 sure
 where


this
 argument
 will
 come,
 but
 you're


perfectly
 right
 that
 you
 could
 also


argue,
 well,
 things
 haven't
 really


changed,
 but
 you
 might
 not
 know
 that,


you
 know,
 so
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 whether


we'll
 face
 this
 or
 not.
 I
 hope
 we
 don't.


I
 hope
 by
 the
 time
 of
 the
 December


meeting,
 we're
 getting,
 you
 know,
 uh,
 a


better
 flow
 of
 data,
 but
 if
 we
 we're


going
 to
 have
 to
 do
 our
 jobs
 one
 way
 or


the
 other.


>> Okay.
 I
 I
 also
 just
 wanted
 to
 ask
 a


FINRA
 question.
 I
 think
 several
 years


ago,
 you
 said
 the
 overall
 amount
 of


capital
 in
 the
 system
 was
 about
 right.


as
 the
 Fed
 moves
 forward
 with
 a
 revised


Basel
 uh
 proposal
 uh
 potentially
 changes


to
 the
 GIP
 search
 charge
 um
 has
 that


changed
 at
 all
 and
 or
 are
 you
 planning


to
 significantly
 reduce
 the
 amount
 of


capital
 in
 the
 system?
 Thanks.


>> So
 there's
 discussions
 going
 on
 I
 think


uh
 among
 the
 um
 agencies
 and
 I
 I
 don't


want
 to
 get
 ahead
 of
 those
 discussions.


Uh
 I
 continue
 to
 think
 that
 the
 level
 of


capital
 when
 I
 said
 that
 in
 2020
 was


about
 right
 and
 of
 course
 there's
 been


much
 capital
 added
 since
 then
 through


various
 mechanisms
 but
 um
 I
 you
 know
 I


look
 forward
 to
 to
 uh
 I
 I
 I
 know
 those


discussions
 are
 really
 just
 getting


going.
 They
 haven't
 come
 to
 the
 point


where
 they're
 you
 know
 where
 they're
 got


a
 whole
 plan
 and
 that
 kind
 of
 thing.
 So


I
 I
 really
 don't
 have
 much
 to
 say
 on


that.


>> Brian.


>> Hi
 Chairman
 Powell.
 Uh
 Brian
 Chung
 with


NBC
 News.
 Um
 is
 the
 weakness
 in
 the
 jobs


market
 accelerating
 and
 who's
 at
 risk
 if


the
 interest
 rate
 cuts
 are
 not
 the


effective
 medicine
 for
 a
 further


slowdown
 in
 the
 labor?


>> So
 we
 we
 do
 not
 see
 um
 the
 weakness
 as


you
 put
 it
 the
 weakness
 in
 the
 job


market
 accelerating.
 I
 would
 say
 then


again
 we
 don't
 have
 we
 didn't
 get
 the


September
 employment
 report
 payroll


report
 but
 um
 we
 do
 get
 we
 look
 at
 you


know
 the


in
 unemployment
 insurance
 claims
 initial


claims
 are
 reported
 at
 the
 state
 level


and
 we
 still
 get
 those
 and
 that
 we
 can


cumulate
 them
 and
 get
 the
 national


number
 and
 there's
 really
 I
 mean
 no


story
 you
 can
 look
 at
 the
 numbers
 same


thing
 with
 the
 job
 openings
 we
 get
 from


Indeed
 there's
 just
 no
 story
 over
 the


last
 four
 weeks
 it's
 kind
 of
 stable
 so


you
 don't
 see
 anything
 that
 says
 that


the
 job
 market
 is
 or
 really
 any
 part
 of


the
 economy
 is
 is
 making
 a
 significant


deterioration
 don't
 see
 that
 um
 you
 see


more
 things
 like
 I
 mentioned
 though


which
 is
 the
 uh
 you
 know
 you
 see
 big


companies
 making
 announcements
 of
 either


of
 layoffs
 or
 of
 the
 idea
 that
 they
 can


they
 don't
 they
 won't
 need
 to
 hire
 they


may
 their
 number
 of
 employees
 is
 not


expected
 to
 go
 up
 over
 a
 number
 of
 years


there
 may
 be
 different
 people
 working


there
 they
 say
 that
 too
 but
 they
 don't


need
 a
 bigger
 headcount
 so
 you
 see
 those


kinds
 of
 things
 you
 don't
 see
 it
 in
 the


aggregate
 numbers
 the
 layoff
 numbers


have
 not
 gone
 up
 but
 job
 creation
 is


very
 low.
 Um,
 and
 the
 the
 job
 finding


rate
 for
 people
 who
 are
 unemployed
 is


very
 low.
 Uh,
 but
 the
 unemployment
 rate


is
 very
 low
 as
 well,
 4.3%.
 Is
 it
 is
 a


low
 employment
 unemployment
 rate?


>> So,
 as
 you
 make
 these
 cuts,
 is
 it
 the


lower
 income
 workers
 that
 you're


thinking
 about
 or
 those
 who
 might
 have


their
 jobs
 automated?
 Is
 there
 a


particular
 labor
 market
 that
 you're


particularly


>> So,
 we
 can't
 our
 our
 tools
 don't
 allow


us
 to
 target
 any
 demographic
 or
 any


income
 level,
 that
 kind
 of
 thing.
 I
 do


think
 that
 people,
 you
 know,
 we
 saw
 this


during
 the
 global
 financial
 crisis
 and


the
 long
 recovery,
 uh,
 if
 you
 have
 a


long
 period
 of
 very
 strong
 labor
 market


conditions,
 it
 benefits
 people
 at
 the


lower
 end
 the
 most.
 the
 last
 two
 or


three
 years
 of
 of
 that
 long
 expansion
 um


people
 at
 the
 lower
 part
 of
 the
 income


spectrum
 were
 getting
 the
 biggest


benefits
 and
 and
 you
 know
 lots
 of
 things


were
 happening
 in
 in
 that
 space


demographically
 which
 were
 very


constructive
 and
 you
 know
 we're
 not
 at


that
 place
 right
 now
 but
 so
 yeah
 you


know
 I
 mean
 a
 stronger
 labor
 market
 is


is
 the
 best
 thing
 we
 can
 do
 for
 for
 the


public
 it's
 also
 part
 of
 our
 job
 it
 is


half
 of
 our
 job
 uh
 but
 it
 is
 it
 is


absolutely
 the
 best
 thing
 we
 can
 do
 um


for
 people
 uh
 you
 know
 along
 with


keeping
 prices
 stable.
 Those
 two
 things


I
 mean
 inflation
 also
 hurts
 people
 on


fixed
 incomes
 more
 than
 other
 people.


>> Courtney,


>> hi
 Chair
 Powell.
 Courtney
 Brown
 from


Axios.
 Um
 as
 you
 know
 the
 12
 Reserve


Bank
 presidents
 terms
 are
 um
 up
 for


renewal
 at
 the
 end
 of
 February.
 I'm


wondering
 if
 you
 can
 give
 us
 a
 timeline


for
 when
 the
 board
 will
 consider
 those


reappoints
 and
 whether
 we
 can
 expect


everyone
 to
 be
 reuped
 or
 if
 we
 can


expect
 some
 changes.


>> So,
 it's
 a
 process
 that
 we
 go
 through


under
 the
 law.
 Uh
 the
 way
 the
 law
 works


is
 we
 we
 have
 an
 reappointment
 process


every
 5
 years
 for
 all
 of
 the
 all
 of
 the


uh
 reser
 each
 each
 of
 them
 and
 all
 of


them.
 We're
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 that


process
 and
 we'll
 we're
 going
 to


complete
 it
 in
 a
 timely
 way
 and
 I
 really


that's
 that's
 really
 all
 I
 can
 say.


>> Okay.
 Thank
 you.


Daniel


>> Daniel
 Ais
 a
 France
 press
 um
 you've
 now


had
 dissents
 in
 three
 consecutive
 FOMC


meetings
 but
 in
 this
 meeting
 you
 had


desents
 going
 in
 both
 directions
 and


you've
 just
 mentioned
 there's
 strong


disagreement
 over
 the
 future
 path
 of


rate
 cuts
 have
 these
 disagreements


complicated
 your
 role
 presiding
 over
 the


FOMC
 meetings
 and
 if
 so
 how


>> I
 wouldn't
 say
 that
 no
 I
 I
 think
 you
 you


know
 you
 have
 to
 take
 what
 comes
 and


what
 comes
 right
 now
 is
 you
 know
 pretty


challenging
 situation
 where
 we
 have


first
 of
 all
 we
 have
 we
 have
 4.3%


unemployment
 we
 have
 an
 economy
 that's


growing
 close
 to
 2%
 so
 you
 know
 overall


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 good
 picture
 it's
 it's
 a


good
 picture
 but
 in
 terms
 of
 our
 policy


we
 have
 upside
 risks
 to
 inflation


downside
 risks
 to
 employment
 and
 this
 is


a
 very
 difficult
 thing
 for
 a
 central


bank
 because
 you
 know
 one
 of
 those
 calls


for
 rates
 to
 be
 lower
 one
 calls
 for


rates
 to
 be
 higher
 we
 can't
 do
 both
 so


we
 have
 to
 balance
 the
 too.
 And
 so
 it's


a
 challenging
 thing
 and
 you
 know
 uh
 as


we
 have
 worked
 our
 way
 through
 this


process
 um
 you
 would
 expect
 that
 there


would
 be
 a
 range
 of
 views
 ac
 across
 the


committee
 on
 on
 what
 to
 do
 and
 the
 speed


with
 which
 we
 should
 do
 it
 and
 that's


what
 we
 have.
 That
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense


to
 me.
 These
 are
 all
 of
 these
 people
 are


you
 know
 people
 who
 take
 their
 jobs
 very


seriously,
 work
 very
 hard
 at
 this
 and


just
 want
 to
 do
 what's
 right
 for
 the


American
 people.
 But
 they
 have
 different


views
 on
 what
 that
 is.
 And
 you
 know,


it's
 an
 honor
 to
 work
 among
 people
 who


care
 that
 much.
 It
 is.
 But
 I,
 you
 know,


I
 I
 don't
 feel
 that
 it's
 unfair
 or
 or
 or


anything
 like
 that.
 It
 just
 it's
 a
 time


when
 we're
 making
 quite
 difficult


judgments
 in
 real
 time.
 And
 I
 I
 believe


we'll
 get
 through
 this.
 And
 and
 I
 I


think
 we've
 done
 sort
 of
 the
 right
 thing


so
 far
 this
 year.
 I
 think
 we
 were
 it
 was


appropriate
 for
 us
 to
 be
 careful
 about


this.
 I
 think
 it
 would
 not
 be


appropriate
 to
 just
 ignore
 or
 assume


away
 the
 inflation
 issue.
 At
 the
 same


time,
 I
 think
 the
 risk
 of
 of
 higher,


more
 persistent
 inflation
 has
 declined


significantly
 since
 April.
 And
 um
 I
 if


if
 we
 if
 we
 do
 wind
 up
 resuming
 rate


cuts
 at
 some
 point,
 we
 will
 at
 some


point.
 Um
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 think
 we're


trying
 to
 get
 to
 the
 end
 of
 this
 cycle


with
 the
 labor
 market
 in
 a
 good
 place


and
 with
 inflation,
 you
 know,
 on
 its
 way


to
 2%
 or
 at
 2%.
 So
 that's
 that's
 all


we're
 trying
 to
 do
 and
 we're
 doing
 it


under,
 you
 know,
 quite
 challenging


circumstances
 and
 doing
 the
 best
 we
 can.


>> We'll
 go
 to
 Jennifer
 for
 the
 last


question.

 you
 so
 much,

 on


subprime
 auto
 loans.
 JP
 Morgan
 CEO
 Jamie


Diamond
 warned,
 "When
 you
 see
 one


cockroach,
 there
 may
 be
 more
 likely."


I'm
 curious
 how
 the
 Fed
 is
 looking
 at


these
 loan
 losses
 and
 if
 it
 poses
 risks


to
 the
 financial
 system
 or
 the
 outlook


for
 the
 economy.
 Is
 it
 a
 warning
 sign?


>> So,
 you
 know,
 we're
 we're
 obviously
 we


watch
 this
 these
 things
 very
 carefully,


credit
 conditions
 very
 carefully.
 You're


right.
 You've
 seen
 rising
 defaults
 in


subprime
 credit
 for
 some
 time
 now
 and


now
 you've
 seen
 a
 number
 of
 of
 subprime


credit
 uh
 automobile
 credit
 uh


institutions
 having
 significant
 losses


and
 some
 of
 those
 losses
 are
 now
 showing


up
 on
 the
 books
 books
 of
 banks.
 You


know,
 we're
 we're
 looking
 at
 it


carefully.
 We're
 paying
 close
 attention.


Uh
 I
 don't
 see
 at
 this
 point
 a
 broader


credit
 issue.
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 be


something
 that
 that
 has
 uh
 very
 broad


application
 across
 financial


institutions
 but
 you
 know
 we're
 going
 to


be
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 monitoring
 this


quite
 carefully
 and
 uh
 and
 making
 sure


that
 that
 is
 the
 case


>> and
 then
 separately
 um
 many
 you
 yourself


have
 said
 that
 we're
 in
 a
 bifurcated


economy
 right
 now
 with
 high
 netw
 worth


individuals
 continuing
 to
 spend
 with
 the


lower
 income
 pulling
 back.
 How
 much
 of


consumer
 spending
 continuing
 hinges
 on


the
 stock
 market
 remaining
 strong?
 In


some
 odd
 way,
 does
 the
 market
 help
 keep


the
 economy
 buoyant?


>> So
 there
 there
 is
 some
 there's
 some


relationship
 there,
 but
 remember
 uh
 the


more
 wealth
 someone
 has,
 the
 lower
 an


additional
 dollar
 of
 wealth
 matters.
 So


your
 marginal
 propensity
 to
 consume


declines
 quite
 dramatically
 as
 you
 reach


as
 you
 reach
 levels
 of
 stock
 market


wealth.
 So,
 you
 know,
 the
 stock
 market,


it
 it
 would
 affect
 spending
 if
 the
 stock


market
 went
 down,
 but
 it
 wouldn't
 drop


it
 wouldn't
 drop
 sharply
 unless
 there


were
 quite
 a
 sharp
 drop
 in
 the
 um
 you


know,
 in
 the
 stock
 market.
 Um
 people
 at


the
 lower
 end
 of
 income
 and
 wealth
 have


a
 much
 higher
 marginal
 propensity
 to


consume
 of
 an
 incremental
 dollar
 of


income
 or
 wealth,
 but
 they
 don't
 have


the
 stock
 market
 wealth.
 So,
 I
 think


it's
 it's
 certainly
 a
 factor
 supporting


consumption
 right
 now.
 Um
 but
 and
 you


would
 you
 would
 see
 it
 if
 you
 saw
 a


material
 correction
 in
 in
 u
 in
 spending


but
 um
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 you
 shouldn't


think
 that
 that
 it'll
 you
 know
 dollar


for
 dollar
 stop
 consumption
 because
 that


wouldn't
 be
 the
 case.
 Thanks
 very
 much.


All
 right,
 that's
 J
 Palunteer.


She's
 pushing
 for
 it.
 She
 is
 pushing
 for


it.
 My
 goodness.


She's
 trying
 to
 go
 for
 two
 hundo
 folks.


We
 haven't
 touched
 it
 yet.
 got
 to
 1998


85.


Uh
 there's
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about
 based
 on


what
 JPAL
 just
 said.
 We
 got
 a
 whiplash


down
 to
 682
 on
 the
 S&P.
 S&P
 still
 red,


folks.
 Haven't
 fully
 recovered
 from
 that


whiplash.
 Individual
 names
 continuing
 to


make
 their
 move
 like
 a
 Palunteer,
 like


an
 Nvidia
 still
 at
 207.
 Uh
 Google


all-time
 highs,
 but
 that
 was
 kind
 of


weird.
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 got
 rugged


as
 well.
 Uh,
 Bitcoin
 now
 back
 a
 bit.


Ethereum
 was
 at
 3,800.
 Bitcoin
 was
 at


109.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 happened
 when
 JPL


said
 that
 we're
 not
 expecting
 the


December
 cut.
 I
 guess
 the
 markets
 got


really
 freaked
 out
 about
 that.
 We'll


talk
 more
 about
 it.
 And
 that's
 what


created
 that
 whiplash.
 But
 now
 we
 are


back
 and
 some
 of
 these
 stocks
 are
 trying


to
 make
 a
 move
 right
 here.
 You
 got


pounds
 right
 there.
 19940.
 200


resistance,
 folks,
 is
 21,000


shares.


201,000
 shares
 to
 see
 a
 two
 handle.


201,727


shares
 to
 be
 exact
 to
 see
 that
 two


handle
 on
 Palunteer.
 Okay,
 so
 let's
 talk


about
 what
 JPAL
 said
 and
 uh
 what's
 going


on.
 So,
 first
 of
 all,
 this
 was
 a
 pretty


weird
 FOMC
 in
 in
 in
 regards
 to
 the
 fact


that
 JPAL
 came
 out
 and
 one
 of
 his


biggest
 talking
 points
 was
 that
 December


rate
 cuts
 are
 not
 confirmed.
 And
 of


course,
 everyone
 knew
 December
 rate
 cuts


were
 not
 going to
 be
 confirmed.
 You


never
 officially
 know
 what
 the
 next


month
 of
 rate
 cuts
 are
 going
 to
 look


like.
 um
 there's
 always
 just
 a


projection
 from
 what
 like
 bond
 market


traders
 and
 and
 prediction
 market


traders
 and
 then
 obviously
 the
 future


traders
 expect.
 But
 he
 made
 a
 big
 point


out
 of
 it
 in
 his
 statement
 and
 that's


what
 I
 think
 really
 got
 the
 market
 to


feel
 weird
 of
 just
 like
 why
 are
 you
 so


adamant
 about
 telling
 us
 that
 we're
 not


getting
 a
 rate
 cut
 in
 December
 and
 again


in
 my
 opinion
 in
 my
 humble
 opinion
 there


is
 no
 world
 in
 which
 we
 don't
 get
 a
 cut


in
 December.
 It
 does
 not
 make
 any
 sense.


I
 mean,
 he
 just
 spent
 the
 past
 hour


talking
 about
 labor
 market
 weakness,
 and


there's
 a
 lot
 to
 dive
 into
 for
 why
 he


said
 the
 labor
 market
 was
 weak,
 but
 you


wouldn't
 say
 that
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 get


a
 rate
 cut
 in
 December.
 Now,
 he
 could


have
 said
 that
 we're
 data
 dependent,
 but


again,
 I
 think
 the
 reason
 the
 markets


and
 the
 algos
 reacted
 the
 way
 they
 did


is
 because
 if
 you
 read
 between
 the


lines,
 it
 wasn't
 just
 him
 saying
 we're


data
 dependent
 like
 he
 usually
 does.
 It


was
 more
 so
 him
 saying,
 "Hey,
 hold
 your


horses,
 guys.
 Hold
 your
 horses.
 We're


not
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 give
 you
 the


December
 cut
 that
 easily."
 And
 I
 think


that's
 why
 markets
 reacted
 a
 bit


negatively.
 But
 again,
 that
 was
 that
 was


eight
 and
 up.
 I
 mean,
 like
 people


decided
 to
 buy
 that
 dip
 immediately
 when


it
 happened.
 You
 probably
 had
 some


people
 that
 sold,
 but
 a
 ton
 of
 people


came
 in
 and
 bought.
 Now,
 what
 did
 he
 say


about
 the
 labor
 market?
 Number
 one,
 he


said
 labor
 uh
 labor
 market
 participation


is
 going
 down.
 So,
 that's
 one
 thing
 that


he
 made
 a
 big
 point
 of.
 Number
 two,
 he


said
 immigration's
 going
 down.
 So,
 a
 lot


of
 the
 jobs
 that
 would
 have
 been
 solved


via
 immigration
 because
 of
 that


declining
 immigration
 from
 a
 policy


perspective,
 that's
 hurting
 the
 labor


market.
 And
 then
 he
 also
 said
 that
 labor


demand
 is
 slowing
 down.
 So
 he
 had
 three


arguments
 from
 Pal
 around
 the
 labor


market.
 Participation
 down,
 declining


immigration,
 and
 then
 overall
 demand


slowing
 down.
 He
 didn't
 really
 make
 that


that
 big
 of
 a
 statement
 around
 AI
 and
 he


didn't
 explicitly
 say
 AI
 is
 the
 reason


for
 this.
 He
 just
 pointed
 broadly


towards
 the
 trends
 that
 he's
 seeing.
 I


mean,
 I
 think
 he
 mentioned
 AI
 a
 couple


times,
 but
 not
 necessarily
 making
 the


argument
 that
 AI
 is
 the
 defining,
 you


know,
 he
 didn't
 go
 as
 deep
 into
 the


whole
 conversation
 as
 we
 did
 in
 the


morning
 around
 Amazon
 and
 AI
 and
 GPUs


and
 capex
 for
 why
 people
 are
 losing


their
 jobs.
 He
 did
 explicitly
 say
 that


the
 labor
 market
 weakness
 as
 per
 the


Amazon
 30,000
 job
 headline
 uh
 is


concerning
 and
 that's
 what
 he
 said
 in


his
 written
 statement
 before
 he
 went


live.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 I
 mean,
 again,
 I


don't
 know
 why
 they
 spent
 any
 time


talking
 about
 no
 December
 cuts
 when
 we


know
 the
 only
 tool
 the
 Fed
 has
 at
 their


disposal
 to
 fight
 the
 labor
 market
 are


interest
 rates.
 So,
 if
 you
 bought
 that


little
 dip
 that
 we
 had,
 I
 mean,
 not
 a


full
 recovery
 in
 every
 single
 name.
 S&P


still
 down
 on
 the
 day,
 down
 about
 0.24%,


24%
 but
 they
 took
 us
 all
 the
 way
 from


689
 to
 682


and
 that
 created
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 pain.


Uh
 I
 just
 bought
 five
 shares
 of
 Meta,


Microsoft,
 and
 Google.
 So
 I
 officially


have
 skin
 in
 the
 game
 for
 all
 these


companies.
 If
 they
 tank,
 then
 I
 guess


that's
 the
 start
 of
 my
 DCA
 on
 all
 three


of
 those.
 I
 have
 some
 more
 Google
 in
 a


separate
 Robinet
 account,
 but
 on
 the


main
 account
 didn't
 have
 any
 Goog.
 I


literally
 bought
 Google
 at
 alltime


highs,
 which
 is
 probably
 stupid,
 but


whatever.
 Uh,
 Meta,
 not
 at
 all-time


highs,
 747.
 I'm
 not
 that
 comfortable


about
 Meta.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 Zux
 is


going to
 say.
 And
 then
 Microsoft,
 I


mean,
 I
 hope
 Azure
 guidance
 is
 good,
 but


this
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 gamble
 for
 me
 on


those
 three
 companies.
 So,
 just
 five


shares
 of
 each.
 We're
 going
 to
 see
 what


plays
 out.
 Makes
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 more


fun
 for
 earnings.
 But
 you
 do
 have
 the


S&P
 500
 at
 685,
 Google
 just
 below
 273,


and
 then
 SoFi
 losing
 two.
 I
 mean,
 SoFi


got
 almost
 down
 below
 30
 as
 soon
 as
 we


had
 that
 whiplash.
 So,
 the
 fact
 that
 all


three
 of
 these
 kind
 of
 went
 or
 the
 fact


that
 all
 the
 entire
 market
 went
 to
 the


downside
 on
 that
 on
 that
 JPAL
 headline


is
 a
 bit
 uh
 is
 a
 bit
 weird,
 but
 that
 is


what
 you
 have
 there.
 Now,
 we
 still
 have


30
 minutes
 left
 till
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


and
 usually
 after
 the
 FOMC,
 those
 final


30
 minutes
 is
 when
 the
 market
 decides
 if


we're
 going
 to
 pump
 or
 dump.
 And
 so,


we're
 going
 to
 see
 now
 kind
 of
 how
 this


plays
 out.
 Amazon
 still
 holding
 on


strong.
 Amazon
 fell
 to
 228,
 no
 227


during
 that
 whiplash.
 Now
 it's
 back
 to


228.
 Got
 to
 a
 high
 of
 232
 today,


but
 you
 do
 have
 some
 of
 these
 names.


Beginning
 uh
 beginning
 to
 recover.
 Uh


what
 else
 did
 JPL
 say?
 So
 let's
 get
 into


a
 couple
 other
 quotes
 that
 he
 had


overall.
 I
 mean
 a
 lot
 of
 questions
 at


the
 end
 I
 think
 were
 pointless.
 I
 mean


some
 of these
 questions
 they
 were
 asking


him,
 you
 know,
 he
 had
 no
 real
 meaningful


way
 to
 respond.
 Now
 the
 question
 about


data
 centers
 I
 think
 was
 important.
 Uh


Pal
 said
 this
 is
 very
 different
 than
 the


dotcom
 bubble.
 The
 companies
 have
 real


earnings
 and
 business
 models
 today.
 If


you
 go
 back
 to.com
 those
 were
 ideas


rather
 than
 companies.
 So
 that
 was
 good


to
 see.
 He
 even
 said
 which
 is
 actually
 I


think
 more
 bullish
 data
 centers
 than


not.
 He
 said
 data
 centers
 don't
 care


about
 interest
 rates.


And
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 bullish


because
 he's
 basically
 like
 dude


whatever
 we
 do
 with
 interest
 rates
 the


demand
 for
 this
 technology
 is
 so
 strong.


the
 demand
 for
 this
 um
 ecosystem


continues
 to
 be
 so
 strong
 that
 interest


rates
 are
 not
 going
 to affect
 the
 data


center
 buildout
 because
 these


hyperscalers
 have
 plenty
 of
 money.
 They


don't
 really
 care
 about
 interest
 rates


when
 it
 comes
 to
 spending
 that
 money
 in


order
 capacity
 they
 need
 for
 GPUs
 and


they're
 willing
 to
 spend
 which
 should
 be


bullish.
 I
 ran
 and
 clean
 spark
 and
 all


those
 companies
 Nebia's
 core
 etc
 that


are
 in
 the
 data
 center
 space.
 Nebia
 is


right
 there
 up
 1.4%
 and
 then
 coreweave


that
 is
 down.
 I'm
 not
 buying
 Amazon


because
 I
 already
 bought
 Amazon.
 I


bought
 Amazon
 214,
 215,
 220
 over
 the


past
 couple
 weeks,
 really
 over
 the
 past


month.
 And
 so
 we'll
 see
 what
 Amazon
 says


tomorrow,
 but
 Amazon
 earnings
 is
 not


today.
 Apple
 and
 Amazon
 tomorrow.
 The


other
 three
 are
 today.
 Nvidia
 back
 up
 to


207


as
 it
 starts
 to
 go
 green.
 Brandon
 says


and
 they
 know
 the
 ROI
 is
 higher
 than
 the


cost
 of
 interest.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 the


interesting
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 the
 same


thing,
 dude.
 The
 fact
 that
 Oracle
 put
 up


40
 billion
 of
 debt
 in
 corporate
 bonds


yielding
 I
 think
 closer
 to
 7%.
 they
 are


pretty
 confident
 they
 will
 make
 through


their
 cloud
 computing
 business
 way
 more


than
 7%
 on
 their
 investments
 and
 so
 they


are
 willing
 to
 take
 on
 all
 that
 debt
 and


so
 I
 I
 do
 think
 it
 was
 bullish
 when
 JPAL


said
 that
 but
 it
 it
 highlights
 how
 much


he
 does
 not
 care
 about
 interest
 rates
 in


the
 context
 of
 AI
 uh
 as
 a
 like
 as
 a
 as
 a


impact
 for
 what
 he
 says
 hurting
 the


broader
 theme
 of
 the
 stock
 market
 in
 AI


because
 he's
 comparing
 it
 to
 the
 dot


bubble
 and
 he's
 saying
 they're
 just
 not


the
 same.
 These
 are
 three
 different
 or


two
 different
 uh
 worlds
 when
 it
 comes
 to


the
 stock
 market
 for
 Chad's
 in
 the
 chat.


Okay,
 Chad.
 Yes,
 I'm
 sending
 you
 the


link.
 We
 were
 supposed
 to
 get
 Chad
 on


earlier
 in
 the
 day.
 We
 didn't
 have
 a


chance
 to
 get
 him
 on.
 Chad,
 I'm
 sending


you
 the
 link
 right
 now.
 Um
 we'll
 get


Chad
 on
 to
 tell
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 more


about
 this
 Palunteer
 Nvidia
 partnership


and
 he
 can
 he
 can
 join.
 Chad,
 I
 just


sent
 you
 the
 link.
 Maybe
 maybe
 uh
 maybe


we
 see
 the
 200o
 when
 Chad
 joins.
 Crazy


day,
 dude.
 Crazy
 freaking
 day.
 19831.


All
 right.
 What
 did
 you
 guys
 do
 during


the
 meeting?
 Did
 anyone
 sell,
 buy?


Anyone
 doing
 the
 earnings
 plays?
 Let
 me


know
 in
 the
 chat.
 Are
 you
 holding
 any
 of


these
 stocks
 going
 into
 earnings?
 Are


you
 doing
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 yolo?


Are
 you
 making
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move?
 I
 mean,


dude,
 if
 some
 of
 these
 stocks
 go
 up
 like


10,
 15%.
 It
 would
 be
 quite
 incredible.


And
 then
 the
 question
 then
 becomes
 for


the
 S&P.


What
 impact
 does
 that
 have
 if
 these
 make


a
 move?
 I
 sold
 a
 little
 bit
 my
 SoFi.
 I


saw
 someone
 said
 they
 bought
 5,000


shares
 of
 BMR.
 This
 one
 got
 all
 the
 way


to
 48.
 Again,
 knee-jerk
 reactions.
 They


got
 hit.
 SoFi
 now
 below
 30
 and
 then
 they


recovered.
 We're
 in
 the
 last
 20
 minutes


of
 the
 close
 today.
 So
 of
 the
 market.
 So


we're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 these
 stocks
 can


actually
 continue
 to
 stay
 above.
 S&P
 is


getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 dump
 right


here.
 Down.33.
 Pounder
 from
 199
 to
 198.


Tesla
 went
 red.
 Nvidia
 holding
 207


which
 is
 nice.
 Got
 BMR
 at
 48.
 Bot
 Hood


and
 SoFi.


Um


I
 mean
 I
 just
 bought
 300
 shares
 a
 pound


here
 at
 199.80.


I
 mean
 again
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 look
 I


think
 it
 is
 200
 after
 earnings
 if
 they


give
 us
 a
 good
 earnings.
 We're
 going
 to


have
 to
 see.
 But
 obviously
 massive


massive
 momentum
 today
 and
 you
 know


you're
 doing
 what
 I
 did
 with
 Google.
 I


know
 I'm
 buying
 it
 at
 all
 time
 highs
 and


if
 it
 falls
 I
 have
 no
 one
 to
 blame
 on


myself.
 But
 it's
 a
 good
 quality
 company


that
 is
 worth
 dcaing
 into.
 Google
 right


there
 27360.


Reddit
 is
 down
 half
 a
 percent.
 Then


Amazon
 just
 went
 red
 right
 here.
 I
 see
 a


decent
 amount
 of
 you
 saying
 I
 bought


BMR.
 I
 bid
 as
 well.


That
 one's
 green.
 By
 the
 way,
 that


politician
 that
 bought
 BB
 AI
 Big
 Bear


like
 three
 months
 ago,
 apparently
 she


didn't
 just
 buy
 50,000.
 She
 bought
 a
 h


100,000.
 There's
 another
 50,000
 she


quote
 unquote
 forgot
 to
 disclose.
 That


was
 revealed
 just
 now.
 She's
 going to


pay
 a
 $200
 fine
 for
 forgetting
 to


disclose
 that.
 But
 Big
 Bear
 up
 about
 1%


on
 the
 day.
 So,
 you
 do
 have
 some
 of
 the


politicians
 buying
 that
 stock
 in
 video


right
 there.
 2.93%.


Up
 right
 now.


Um,
 okay.
 Let's
 see


couple
 of
 other
 of
 these.


Did
 Pal
 say
 the
 labor
 market
 is


weakening?
 Pala
 like
 objectively
 and


explicitly
 said
 we
 see
 weakness
 in
 the


labor
 market
 and
 that's
 why
 it's
 getting


I
 mean
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 the
 markets


are
 easily
 pricing
 in
 that
 December
 cut


even
 though
 Pal
 said
 to
 not
 price
 it
 and


by
 the
 way
 on
 the
 prediction
 markets


there
 was
 a
 90%
 chance
 for
 a
 December


cut
 now
 it's
 71%
 chance
 after
 what
 Jay


Pal
 said
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's


necessarily
 going
 to
 make
 that
 much
 of
 a


difference
 going
 into
 uh
 December.


Chad,
 what's
 up?


>> I
 just
 lost
 your
 audio.


>> Oh,
 you
 can't
 hear
 me?


>> I
 can't
 hear
 you.


>> Okay,
 I'll
 get
 you
 on
 in
 a
 second.


We'll
 get
 Chad
 back
 on
 in
 a
 second.
 I'll


tell
 him
 to


rejoin.


That
 might
 help.


Uh,
 yeah,
 Nvidia
 was
 up
 5%.
 Now
 it's


down
 three.


All
 right,
 he's
 going
 to
 go
 rejoin.


Um,
 here's
 another
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 show


everybody
 before
 we
 get
 into
 these


earnings.
 Take
 a
 look
 at
 this
 chart


right
 here.
 Microsoft,
 Amazon,
 and


Google
 now
 have
 nearly
 700
 billion
 in


combined
 backlog.


Most
 of
 that
 backlog
 again
 is
 related
 to


customer
 cloud
 commitments.
 So
 this
 is


going
 to
 be
 another
 really
 really


important
 thing
 to
 see
 today
 if
 they
 can


increase
 their
 RPO
 customer
 cloud


agreements
 overall
 guidance
 obviously


operating
 margins
 across
 the
 cloud


and
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 to
 see
 what


numbers
 they
 put
 up.
 Uh
 Modziz
 thank
 you


for
 becoming
 a
 channel
 member.
 Vip
 Patel


thank
 you
 for
 the
 $5
 super
 chat
 and


Meustoto
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat
 as


well.
 What
 a
 fun
 day
 to
 spend
 with
 you


and
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 long
 stream.
 Thank


you
 guys
 all
 for
 being
 here.
 First
 time


in
 a
 while
 we
 did
 a
 long
 stream
 almost


seven
 hours.
 We're
 going to
 go
 probably


another
 two,
 three
 hours,
 but
 it's
 a
 big


day.
 It's
 a
 big
 day.
 It's
 a
 fun
 day.


Happy
 everyone
 has
 been
 here
 throughout


the
 entire
 day.
 All right.
 Can
 you
 hear


me?


>> I
 just
 lost
 you
 again.
 As
 soon
 as
 you


brought
 me
 up,
 I
 lost
 you,


>> dude.
 We
 need
 some
 pounds
 here
 to
 fix


this.
 What's
 going
 on?
 It's
 okay.
 No


worries.


All right,
 dude.
 It's
 because
 it's
 a


freaking
 uh
 Azure,
 bro.
 It's
 because
 of


Azure.
 Azure
 going
 down
 today.


as
 you're
 going
 down.
 Okay.
 So,


is
 it
 back?
 Is
 it
 back?
 We're
 good.


>> We're
 good
 now.


>> Okay.
 Perfect.


>> Technology.


>> Technology.


>> There's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 echo,
 so
 I'm


going
 to
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 to
 just
 speak


and
 then
 mute
 myself
 immediately.


>> Here,
 I'm
 going
 to
 switch
 here.
 Is
 this


better?


>> Hello.


>> Hello.
 Yes.


>> All
 right.
 Cool.


Wait.
 Hi.
 Okay,
 good.
 Good.
 No
 echo.


Okay,
 cool.
 Uh,
 Nvidia
 Palunteer,
 what's


going
 on
 here,
 Chad?


>> This
 is
 exciting.
 We've
 been
 working
 on


this
 for
 a
 while.
 Um,
 but
 the
 the
 big


thing
 everyone's
 like,
 well,
 what
 does


it
 mean?
 Like,
 and
 we're
 partnering,


right?
 So,
 in
 reality,
 what's
 happening


now
 is
 like
 having
 Nvidia
 models,


whether
 they're
 deterministic


optimization
 models
 or
 some
 of the
 LM


stuff
 like
 the
 Neatron
 or
 Nemo


Retriever.
 um
 these
 different
 models


they
 have
 that
 are
 LM
 based
 based
 on


like
 the
 llama
 stuff
 that
 they've
 been


they've
 taken
 the
 llama
 open
 source


models
 and
 created
 their
 own
 highly


tuned
 models.
 So
 those
 will
 be
 available


in
 platform
 and
 then
 their
 uh
 their
 koop


um
 optimization
 engine
 is
 available
 as


well.
 So
 like
 I
 I
 got
 all
 excited
 about


this
 because
 even
 this
 morning
 the


reason
 I
 had
 to
 miss
 this
 morning's
 call


is
 I
 had
 to
 meet
 with
 a
 customer
 who
 was


excited
 about
 our
 Nvidia
 announcement


and
 wanted
 to
 talk
 about
 this.
 So
 it
 is


has
 brought
 a
 lot
 of
 energy
 about
 it.
 Um


a
 lot
 of
 questions
 actually
 then
 had


another
 call
 today
 where
 you
 know


customers
 are
 bringing
 up
 what
 Jensen


said
 about
 us
 excited
 about
 the


opportunity
 to
 work
 together
 with


everyone.
 So
 lots
 of
 excitement
 about
 it


but
 really
 the
 idea
 here
 is
 more
 models


more
 optionality
 brings
 first
 and
 like


best-in-class
 optimization
 models
 into


the
 platform
 for
 people
 to
 use
 and


orchestrate
 with
 AIP.
 So
 like
 really


cool
 exciting
 stuff.
 Of
 course
 you
 bring


up
 the
 stock
 price.
 I'm
 sure
 my
 lawyers


will
 love
 that.


>> Well,
 well,
 you
 know,
 if
 we
 hit
 200,


then
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 have
 to
 keep


the
 stock
 price
 down.
 Um,


>> but
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 the
 the
 big
 thing


here
 is
 like
 there
 should
 be
 more


options.
 You
 should
 have
 more


optionality
 with
 tools,
 more
 options


where
 you
 run
 them.
 Um,
 and
 that's


really
 what
 this
 is
 about
 is
 that


optionality
 to
 use
 the
 right
 tool
 for


the
 problem.


>> What
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 integrating
 models?


because
 I
 do
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 were


confused
 about
 what
 like
 we
 know
 what


pound
 your
 AIP
 is,
 we
 know
 they
 connect


to
 a
 lot
 of
 models.
 How
 does
 that
 work


with
 like
 Nvidia
 specific
 models
 I


guess?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 so
 like
 think
 about
 this
 like


let's
 say
 in
 the
 example
 we
 posted
 a


video
 of
 Lowe's
 how
 we
 built
 this


together
 with
 Nvidia
 to
 show
 this
 as
 an


example
 and
 and
 really
 the
 the
 concept


here
 is
 it's
 not
 just
 about
 like


generative
 AI
 like
 generative
 AI
 is
 not


great
 at
 optimization.


Optimization
 models
 are
 great
 at


optimization.
 They're
 very
 much
 more


deterministic.
 Both
 are
 running
 on
 GPUs.


Both
 are
 AI
 models,
 right?
 The
 thing
 is


you
 need
 to
 orchestrate


the
 calls,
 the
 access
 to
 data,
 the


handoff
 functions,
 the
 security.
 So
 what


I
 can
 do
 with
 this
 is
 actually
 have
 the


generative
 AI
 models
 help
 me
 reason


access
 data
 across
 my
 enterprise
 bring


the
 context
 that
 I
 need
 make
 calls
 to


the
 optimization
 model
 get
 results
 back


orchestrate
 the
 results
 into
 actions


that
 are
 being
 taken.
 So
 think
 about


what
 you're
 seeing
 on
 the
 screen
 there


like
 that
 graphic
 we
 call
 it
 the


sandwich
 graphic
 but
 it's
 it's
 really


the
 ontology
 is
 the
 operating
 system.


Now
 we
 have
 more
 access
 to
 tools
 and


drivers
 essentially
 in
 my
 operating


system
 to
 orchestrate
 this.
 So
 for
 the


Lowe's
 example
 you
 got
 on
 the
 screen


here.
 How
 do
 I
 optimize
 my
 supply
 chain?


Well,
 now
 I
 have
 AI
 agents
 running.


They're
 calling
 optimization
 models
 to


help
 me
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 reroute


something
 better.
 Then
 the
 agent
 takes


that
 and
 turns
 into
 actions
 to
 actually


change
 that
 in
 their
 ERP
 to
 reroute


product
 to
 make
 it
 real.
 And
 so
 that's


where
 like
 now
 we
 have
 best-in-class


access
 to
 all
 the
 NVIDIA
 infrastructure


and
 models
 right
 inside
 of
 AIP.


>> When
 Jensen
 said
 yesterday
 that
 uh
 the


Poundrontology
 is
 the
 single
 most


important
 enterprise
 stack
 in
 the
 world,


I
 mean
 Jensen's
 not
 saying
 that
 lightly.


Do
 do
 do do do do do do do do do do do


do do do do do do do do do
 do do do do




do do do do do do do do do do do do do
do do do
 you
 think
 the
 reason
 he's
 kind


of
 making
 that
 assertion
 based
 on
 the


partnership
 that
 you've
 had
 with
 Nvidia


is
 because
 they're
 recognizing
 that


these
 LLMs
 as
 valuable
 as
 they
 are
 and


Nvidia's
 been
 supporting
 the
 LMS
 for
 the


past
 couple
 years
 the
 integration
 of
 LMS


for
 business
 use
 cases
 which
 is
 that


whole
 ROI
 that
 the
 entire
 industry
 is


looking
 for
 that
 comes
 ultimately


through
 the
 ontology.


>> Yeah
 it
 I
 mean
 LM
 aren't
 trained
 on
 your


business
 data.
 No
 one
 wants
 LLM
 trained


on
 their
 business
 data.
 They
 want
 it
 to


have
 the
 context
 your
 business.
 Ontology


stores
 the
 context
 about
 how
 you


operate.
 It's
 the
 data,
 the
 logic,
 the


actions
 of
 your
 business.
 Then
 you
 bring


in
 the
 LMS
 that
 are
 not
 trained
 on
 that.


And
 the
 two
 of
 those
 together
 running
 on


the
 NVIDIA
 hardware
 that
 is
 the
 valuable


part.
 And
 so
 to
 really
 wield
 them,
 you


need
 to
 have
 that
 contextual
 store.
 But


it's
 more
 than
 just
 data.
 That's
 the


problem
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 fall
 short


with
 like
 co-pilots
 and
 other
 things
 is


if
 it's
 just
 the
 data
 that's
 missing
 the


logic
 about
 how
 to
 how
 your
 business


operates
 the
 living
 breathing
 organism


that
 the
 businesses
 are
 and
 the
 actions


of
 like
 what
 are
 the
 levers
 I
 can
 take


to
 optimize
 my
 business
 and
 that
 is
 what


the
 ontology
 really
 contextualize
 now


you
 also
 need
 to
 have
 like
 enterprise


level
 security
 you
 have
 to
 have
 all


these
 other
 things
 as
 well
 as
 that


integrated
 into
 this
 ecosystem
 and
 then


LMS
 really
 help
 accelerate
 that
 and
 so


That's
 that's
 really
 what
 this
 is
 about.


And
 so
 whenever
 we
 have
 like
 a


partnership
 like
 with
 Nvidia
 here
 is
 our


goal
 is
 how
 do
 I
 get
 our
 customer
 to


outcomes
 faster
 by
 having
 Nvidia
 stuff


integrated
 in
 the
 platform
 that
 means
 I


can
 use
 the
 models
 faster
 I
 can
 run
 the


optimizations
 faster
 right
 so
 when
 when


I
 heard
 Jensen
 and
 Karp
 talking
 about


how
 you
 know
 how
 we're
 going
 to


accelerate
 things
 the
 fact
 that
 I
 can


now
 run
 the
 best-in-class
 optimization


model
 for
 supply
 chain


like
 that
 inside
 of
 AIP
 from
 an
 agent


that's
 incredible.
 So
 now
 I
 can
 show
 up


to
 customers
 and
 execute
 that
 much


quicker.
 The
 computes
 that
 much
 quicker,


right?
 So
 it's
 it's
 a
 value
 for
 our


customer
 and
 that's
 really
 what
 we're


talking
 about.


>> Last
 question
 for
 you,
 Chad.
 Again,


thanks
 for
 taking
 the
 time
 out
 to
 talk


about
 this.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


appreciating
 more
 clarity
 on
 this


partnership.
 Uh
 Karp
 on
 the
 CNBC


interview
 yesterday
 with
 with
 Jensen
 was


was
 talking
 more
 about
 the
 idea
 of
 AI
 as


a
 addition
 versus
 subtraction
 from
 the


American
 labor
 force.
 Uh
 all
 of
 us
 are


seeing
 massive
 massive
 layoffs.
 Amazon


with
 30,000
 announced
 yesterday.
 I
 think


one
 of
 Karp's
 big
 talking
 points
 over


the
 past
 couple
 of
 months
 has
 been
 that


AI
 should
 be
 an
 addition
 and
 AIP


ontology
 all
 this
 stuff
 should
 enhance


the
 worker,
 not
 replace
 the
 worker.
 How


do
 you
 think
 this
 partnership
 with


Nvidia
 kind
 of
 culminates
 into
 that


ethos
 that
 Palunteer
 is
 not
 trying
 to
 be


the
 company
 that
 replaces
 you,
 but


rather
 be
 the
 tool
 that
 accelerates
 your


productivity?


Well,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 theory
 verse


reality.
 Where
 I'm
 living
 is
 in
 the


reality
 at
 the
 edge
 with
 the
 people.
 So,


if
 you
 actually
 are
 building
 the
 systems


for
 real
 at
 the
 edge
 with
 those
 people,


what
 you're
 seeing
 is
 your
 best
 domain


expert
 on
 supply
 chain
 or
 on
 the


warehouse,
 you're
 seeing
 the
 dream
 and


the
 thing
 that
 they
 always
 knew
 like
 if


I
 could
 just
 do
 this
 thing.


AI
 gives
 them
 the
 agency
 to
 do
 and
 build


what
 they
 want
 what
 they
 like
 what
 they


can
 go
 build.
 So
 now
 you
 are
 giving


people
 agency
 to
 go
 build
 to
 have
 more


output
 like
 I
 like
 there
 is
 a
 finite


amount
 of
 reducing
 you
 can
 do
 there
 is


an
 infinite
 amount
 of
 growth
 you
 can
 do


right
 and
 so
 I
 always
 look
 at
 this
 as


how
 am
 I
 10xing
 rather
 than
 cutting
 by


50%.
 that
 is
 infinitely
 more
 valuable


and
 so
 that's
 really
 what
 we
 should
 be
 f


focused
 on
 is
 how
 do
 we
 drive
 the
 output


the
 value
 creation
 is
 what
 it's
 about


>> yeah
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 Jensen
 said


this
 partnership
 is
 going
 to
 supercharge


the
 palry
 ontology
 I
 think
 the
 increased


access
 to
 models
 and
 all
 the
 different


suite
 of
 features
 right
 there
 just
 makes


the
 context
 of
 the
 organization
 more


valuable
 and
 as
 a
 result
 as
 Karp
 says


the
 value
 is
 uh
 or
 the
 val
 the
 upside
 is


from
 is
 is
 down
 is
 downstream
 from
 the


value
 creation
 the
 partnership
 with


Nvidia
 should
 only
 help
 create
 more
 and


more
 value
 for
 these
 customers,


>> right?
 And
 and
 this
 is
 just
 the
 start.
 I


mean,
 we
 just
 we
 just
 wanted
 to
 launch


and
 have
 real
 stuff,
 real
 product.
 Like,


I'm
 I'm
 never
 going
 to
 have
 a


partnership
 that
 is
 not
 around
 real


things
 just
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 putting
 two


names
 together.
 We
 could
 have
 launched


this
 a
 long
 kind
 of
 time
 ago
 if
 that
 was


the
 case.
 We
 want
 real
 product
 of
 us


working
 on
 real
 problems
 for
 real


customers.
 So,
 like
 this
 is
 just
 the


start.
 Now,
 it's
 about
 the
 opportunities


of
 us
 both
 working
 together.
 What
 other


ways
 can
 we
 accelerate
 time
 to
 value
 for


our
 customers?
 How
 do
 we
 help
 them
 run


models
 faster,
 quicker?
 And
 so
 this
 is


this
 is
 really
 the
 idea
 of
 like
 when
 we


say
 like
 we're
 only
 beginning
 like


literally
 like
 this
 is
 just
 a
 few
 little


subset.
 There's
 so
 many
 ideas
 that
 we


both
 have
 together
 what
 we
 can
 go
 build.


Um
 and
 when
 you
 start
 talking
 about
 the


chips
 and
 ontology
 that
 is
 really
 where


the
 value
 creation
 is.


>> Chips
 and
 ontology.
 I
 love
 it.
 Chad,


thank
 you
 so
 much.
 There's
 his
 Twitter.


You
 guys
 can
 follow
 him
 right
 there
 and


uh
 looking
 forward
 to
 getting
 a
 lot
 more


details
 on
 how
 this
 partnership
 evolves.


>> All right,
 see
 you
 all.
 Thanks
 all.


>> Thank
 you,
 Chad.
 Appreciate
 it.


All
 right,
 there
 we
 go.
 Nvidia
 and


Palanteer,
 that
 partnership
 is
 now


official.
 Been
 waiting
 years
 to
 see
 it


happen
 and
 it
 is
 happening.
 Let's
 bring


on
 the
 next
 guest,
 folks,
 who's
 going
 to


be
 with
 me
 for
 the
 next
 few
 hours,
 I


believe,
 as
 we
 cover
 these
 earnings.


Sam,


>> what
 is
 up?
 Whips
 whiplashing
 left
 and


right,
 dude.


You
 know,
 honestly,
 coming
 into
 this


morning,
 um,
 small
 caps
 have
 just
 been


lagging
 the
 whole
 rally,
 probably
 for


the
 last
 few
 days,
 which
 is
 interesting


because
 they
 led
 the
 whole
 way
 up.
 And


then
 you
 have
 mega
 cap
 basically
 gaining


most
 of
 the
 inflow.
 So,


>> oh,
 they're
 getting
 hit.
 They're
 going


down.


>> Yeah,
 they
 got
 they
 got
 pretty
 hit.
 Um,


so
 I
 I
 I
 had
 you
 a
 little
 bit.
 I
 I
 I


seen
 crypto
 being
 pretty
 weak
 lately,
 so


I
 decided
 to
 um
 cut
 some
 swings
 when
 it


comes
 to
 crypto,
 but
 um
 still
 in
 the


data
 center
 names.
 I
 mean,
 Nebius
 is


green
 on
 the
 day
 that
 had
 a
 massive
 dip


buying
 opportunity
 just
 a
 couple
 of


hours
 ago.
 Um
 I
 did
 not
 buy
 the
 dip


though.
 I
 did
 have
 like
 some
 covered


calls
 on
 Iron
 and
 Nebius
 that
 I
 ended
 up


buying
 back,
 but
 I
 don't
 know.
 We
 got


these
 earnings
 after
 hours.
 I
 think
 the


market
 is
 just
 totally
 looking
 forward


to
 the
 entire
 event.


>> What
 was
 your
 reaction
 to
 Mr.
 JPAL?
 By


the
 way,
 Google
 right
 here.
 270.


Where
 is
 it?
 Four,
 dude.
 I
 bought
 this


at
 273
 like
 10
 minutes
 ago.
 So,
 this
 is


pretty
 incredible.
 Uh,
 what
 was
 your


reaction,
 Sam,
 to
 what
 JPAL
 said?
 And
 do


you
 think
 he
 said
 anything
 that
 was


enough
 to
 be
 different
 from
 before?
 Uh,


I
 did
 think
 that
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 odd
 how


he
 was
 like
 saying,
 you
 were
 mentioning


it
 earlier
 during
 the
 stream.
 I
 was


watching
 it
 where
 was
 like,
 uh,
 yeah,


we're
 going
 to
 kind
 of
 slow
 down
 with


the
 rate
 cuts.
 Are
 we're
 going
 to
 kind


of,
 you
 know,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 that


unemployment
 is
 starting
 to
 see
 an


uptick
 here.
 Inflation
 risk.
 It's
 like
 I


This
 guy's
 looking
 at
 the
 market.
 He
 is


looking
 at
 the
 stock
 market
 and
 he's


like,
 "All
 right,
 it
 can't
 prop
 up
 stuff


again
 this
 again."
 Right?
 So,
 I
 mean,


the
 way
 that
 I
 see
 it,
 and
 I
 see
 some


people
 uh
 commenting
 regarding
 the
 7500


target.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 SP
 500
 is


still
 going
 to
 get
 to
 7500,
 but
 I
 also


think
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 small
 caps
 and
 a


lot
 of
 the
 more
 speculative
 stuff
 has


had
 a
 massive
 run.
 Like,
 am
 I
 going
 to


be
 pressing
 the
 gas
 here?
 Probably
 not


on
 it.
 Uh,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 um
 the


mega
 caps
 have
 a
 pretty
 good
 amount
 of


upside
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 things
 that
 are


more
 the
 value
 sense.
 Even
 though
 I


don't
 think
 Amazon
 is
 like
 too
 over
 is


even
 overvalued
 or
 anything.
 But
 I
 mean,


we
 got
 some
 catching
 up
 to
 do,
 right?
 We


we
 got
 I
 mean
 Amazon
 tested
 that
 200
 day


moving
 average
 just
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago


>> and
 it's
 bounced
 pretty
 considerably


since
 then.
 like
 uh
 not
 even
 10%,
 but


you
 know
 it
 when
 you
 really
 think
 about


like
 the
 market
 and
 everything
 like
 what


has
 really
 been
 running
 the
 last
 few


weeks
 that
 is
 no
 longer
 running
 anymore.


Everything's
 going
 back
 to
 the
 mega


caps.
 So


>> do
 you
 think
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 having


a
 bit
 of
 a
 moment
 right
 now?


>> I
 saw
 those
 posts
 about
 Amazon
 and
 I


mean
 I
 voiced
 it
 that
 well
 they're
 not


laying
 off
 people
 across
 the
 entire


board.
 They're
 laying
 off
 people
 mostly


in
 corporate
 and
 also
 retail.
 And
 they


closed
 a
 lot
 of
 stores.
 Like
 the
 stores


have
 not
 been
 doing
 good.
 So
 really,
 I


mean,
 I
 if
 they
 were
 laying
 off
 people


in
 Azure,
 if
 they
 were
 laying
 off,
 I'm


sorry,
 in
 AWS,
 if
 they're
 laying
 off


people
 in
 ad
 markets
 and
 stuff,
 then


okay,
 maybe
 that
 might
 be
 something.
 But


I
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 like
 directly


contributed
 because
 of
 AI
 cutting
 jobs.


I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 has
 to
 do
 with
 the


fact
 that
 we're
 normalizing
 job


openings.
 uh
 we
 went
 on
 a
 massive
 hiring


spree
 during
 COVID
 and
 that's
 starting


to
 normalize
 at
 this
 point.
 I
 I
 don't


think
 that
 the
 fear
 that
 AI
 is
 going
 to


take
 everyone's
 jobs.
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 going
 to
 come
 really
 for
 like
 the


next
 few
 years,
 maybe
 like
 five
 or
 10


years
 till
 that
 really
 has
 an
 effect.


But
 I
 think
 by
 that
 point
 people
 are


going
 to
 adjust
 like
 look
 with
 computers


and
 when
 the
 internet
 started
 people
 had


to
 adjust.
 People
 had
 to
 learn
 how
 to


use
 internet
 and
 if
 you
 don't
 know
 how


to
 use
 internet
 then
 you
 probably
 have
 a


hard
 time
 finding
 a
 job
 today.
 And
 then


it
 came
 with
 infrastructure
 and


engineering
 basically
 turning
 into
 code


applications
 and
 people
 in
 my
 field
 had


to
 learn
 how
 to
 do
 that
 otherwise
 you


got
 cut
 from
 your
 job
 and
 then
 now
 today


it's
 AI
 like
 you
 you
 just
 it's
 another


skill
 you
 need
 to
 learn
 but
 it's
 just
 at


a
 much
 more
 accelerated
 pace.


Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 And
 JPAL
 didn't
 give
 us


any
 comments
 about
 how
 bad
 he
 thinks
 AI


is
 affecting
 the
 market,
 but
 he
 did


acknowledge
 there
 is
 a
 impact
 on
 the


labor
 market
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


something
 that
 the
 Fed
 or
 market


participants
 can
 ignore.
 Uh
 these
 are


the
 earnings
 we
 have
 folks.
 Carvana
 is


up.
 Chipotle,
 Marta,
 Libre,
 Starbucks,


then
 you
 have
 the
 big
 three.
 We
 have
 a


couple
 other
 earnings,
 but
 it's
 going to


be
 pretty
 wild
 after
 the
 bill
 when
 we


get
 into
 them.
 Sam,
 any
 predictions
 from


you
 on
 Meta,
 Google,
 Microsoft,
 and
 what


you
 think
 we
 get
 today?
 I
 I'm
 looking
 at


capex
 mostly
 and
 I'm
 also
 looking
 at
 um


Azure
 growth
 and
 GCP
 growth.
 That's


going
 to
 be
 like
 a
 telling
 sign
 as
 far


as
 how
 much
 demand
 there
 actually
 is
 in


the
 market.
 Uh
 I
 mean
 who
 knows
 with


with
 Azure.
 Azure
 came
 in
 at
 39%
 which


is
 pride
 the
 street.
 It
 was
 like
 a
 35%


last
 quarter
 for
 the
 estimates
 and
 it


came
 in
 at
 39%
 which
 is
 insane.
 And


Google
 was
 about
 in
 line
 with
 estimates.


I
 I
 do
 think
 that
 we're
 going
 to


continue
 seeing
 maybe
 flat
 to
 upper


momentum
 on
 that.
 I'd
 imagine
 Microsoft


is
 going
 to
 reacelerate
 past
 39%.
 At


least
 at least
 I
 I
 would
 expect
 them
 to


only
 because
 look
 at
 how
 many
 people
 are


signing
 up
 with
 Azure
 and
 also
 on
 top
 of


that
 look
 at
 all
 these
 deals
 you're


getting
 with
 OpenAI
 and
 uh
 and
 Azure
 and


then
 you
 know
 you
 also
 have
 them
 signing


up
 with
 uh
 Nebius
 to
 uh
 build
 more
 data


centers.
 you
 know,
 they
 they
 better
 do


good
 in
 their
 top
 on
 their
 top
 line
 when


it
 comes
 to
 Azure,
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 GCP


for
 Google
 because
 if
 they
 don't,
 I


think
 that
 might
 cause
 a
 little
 bit
 of


scare
 as
 far
 as
 demand
 goes.
 And
 then


Capex,
 I
 I
 think
 this
 is
 going
 to


directly
 impact
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 data
 center


stocks
 like
 Nebius
 and
 Iron,
 Cipher,
 and


so
 on.
 Iring
 actually
 got
 a
 downgrade


this
 morning,
 so
 that's
 probably
 the


reason
 why
 it's
 weak.
 But
 dude,
 if
 Capex


is
 flat
 to
 down,
 uh
 I
 don't
 I
 I'm
 not
 so


sure
 if
 these
 stocks
 will
 be
 up
 after


hours.
 they
 might
 get
 hit
 pretty
 hard


and
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 hit
 with
 the


semiconductor
 stocks
 too.
 So,
 we'll
 see.


>> That's
 the
 bare
 case.
 If
 Capex
 guidance


is
 down
 and
 these
 companies
 don't
 have


the
 cloud
 revenues
 accelerating
 like
 the


street
 expects
 them
 to
 the
 Nebuses,
 the


Core
 Reeves,
 they're
 all
 derivatives
 of


these
 hyperscalers
 getting
 a
 deal
 with


them.
 So,


>> I'd
 be
 very
 surprised.
 I
 mean,
 with
 that


presidential
 dinner
 that
 just
 happened
 a


couple
 months
 ago
 with
 Zuckerberg


basically
 saying
 out
 there,
 oh,
 you
 hit


or
 miss
 a
 couple
 hundred
 billion


dollars,
 you
 know,
 like
 I
 would
 be


surprised
 if
 they
 reduce
 capex.
 If


anything,
 I
 would
 expect
 them
 to


increase
 capex
 and
 if
 they
 don't


increase
 it,
 I
 I
 just
 I
 think
 the
 market


is
 expecting
 an
 increase
 in
 capex,
 but
 I


think
 it's
 going
 to
 happen.


>> Agreed.
 Google
 275,
 are
 you
 nervous
 that


it's
 pumping
 before
 earnings
 or


>> not
 really?
 I
 I I
 think
 uh
 a
 lot
 of


money
 is
 rotating
 into
 mega
 caps
 and


basically
 value
 lately.
 Um
 I
 think


that's
 going
 to
 continue
 happening
 for
 a


little
 bit
 of
 time
 and
 I
 think
 that's


really
 what's
 going
 to
 push
 the
 market


up.
 You
 know,
 because
 if
 you
 think
 about


all
 these
 small
 caps,
 like
 you
 can
 see


IWM
 is
 pretty
 weak
 today.
 Um
 that
 isn't


going
 to
 these
 small
 caps
 are
 not
 going


to
 push
 the
 market
 up.
 What's
 going
 to


push
 the
 market
 up
 are
 the
 mega
 caps
 and


they've
 been
 lagging
 a
 little
 bit.
 But


if
 you
 get
 like
 Google
 at
 300,
 you
 get


Microsoft
 at
 450,
 you
 get
 Amazon
 like
 at


250
 bucks
 or
 more,
 Meta
 at
 800
 plus,


dude,
 we're
 going
 to
 7500.
 Like
 the


thesis
 is
 not
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 to


7500
 because
 every
 single
 piece
 of
 crap


in
 the
 market's
 going to
 go
 up.
 The


thesis
 is
 that
 the
 mega
 caps
 are
 going


to
 catch
 up.
 That's
 the
 thesis.
 And
 it's


going
 to
 be
 super
 volatile.
 You
 just
 saw


it
 today.
 Like
 it's
 going
 to
 be


extremely
 volatile.
 There's
 going to
 be


shakeouts
 and
 stuff.
 There's
 also
 going


to
 be
 opportunities
 to
 kind
 of
 hedge
 the


market
 or
 maybe
 sell
 some
 covered
 calls


and
 stuff
 and
 we
 got
 a
 crazy
 opportunity


this
 morning.
 Um,
 but
 you
 know,
 other


than
 that,
 like
 dude,
 I
 I've
 cut
 a


significant
 amount
 of
 speculative


exposure
 in
 in
 the
 last
 couple
 of
 months


and
 I've
 rotated
 more
 capital
 into
 mega


caps
 and
 value
 stuff
 that's
 actually


been
 working.
 Like
 I'm
 not
 buying
 the


Verizon's,
 I'm
 not
 buying
 um
 Ficeerve
 or


I'm
 not
 buying
 like
 a
 lot
 of,
 you
 know,


the
 stuff
 that
 Chris
 usually
 focuses
 on.


Uh
 if
 anything,
 I'm
 buying
 more
 of


growth
 that
 is
 of
 really
 good
 value.
 So


people
 are
 asking
 about
 Rubric.
 Rubric


is
 near
 70
 bucks
 and
 it's
 pulled
 back


pretty
 considerably
 from
 its
 recent


high.
 Uh
 am
 I
 adding
 here?
 I
 mean,
 I


already
 added
 pretty
 aggressively
 in
 the


high
 70s,
 maybe
 a
 little
 too
 early.
 Um


but
 you
 know,
 we'll
 see.
 We
 have
 a
 we
 we


do
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 enterprise
 software


earnings
 coming
 up.
 I
 think
 I
 think
 um


service
 now
 is
 reporting
 today
 if
 I'm


not
 mistaken.


>> Yes.
 Yes,
 they
 are.


>> Yeah.
 S
 that
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big


factor
 in
 it.
 When
 Amazon
 reports


tomorrow
 that's
 going
 to
 move
 the


software
 market
 too.
 Software
 has
 not


been
 leading
 this
 charge
 up
 other
 than


specific
 cyber
 security
 leaders.
 We
 need


to
 see
 that
 continue
 momentum
 into


cloud.
 If
 you
 do
 these
 names
 will
 come


back.
 Um,
 but
 until
 then,
 dude,
 I'm


bullish.
 Rubik,
 get
 I
 want
 to
 get
 out
 of


here.
 I'm
 bullish
 Rubic.
 Get
 I
 I
 don't
 I


I
 I I
 don't
 care
 whatever
 anyone
 says.


Cyber
 security
 is
 here
 to
 stay,
 right?


Cyber
 security
 will
 always
 be
 around
 and


it's
 become
 super
 important
 the
 further


we
 go
 down
 this
 AI
 track.
 So,
 I'm
 still


bullish
 Rubric.
 Am
 I
 adding
 in
 like


short-term
 calls
 and
 everything?


Probably
 not.
 Like,
 that's
 kind
 of
 scary


to
 be
 doing
 that
 right
 now.
 Um,
 but
 I'm


still
 holding
 my
 position.
 I'll
 probably


be
 adding
 maybe
 in
 next
 couple
 weeks.
 Uh


I
 I
 only
 have
 a
 few
 percents
 of
 cash


left.
 I
 don't
 have
 too
 much
 cash.


Uh
 Meta
 Street
 wants
 667
 per
 share.
 They


want
 49.4
 billion
 in
 revenue.
 Google


Street
 wants
 227
 a
 share
 and
 101
 billion


of
 revenue.
 And
 then
 Microsoft
 Street


wants
 366
 a
 share
 and
 75.39


billion
 of
 revenue.
 Folks,
 it's
 not
 too


often
 you
 get
 three
 of
 the
 most


important
 companies
 on
 the
 planet


reporting,
 but
 nonetheless,
 they


reporting
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 Final
 poll


for
 the
 day.
 Which
 one
 do
 you
 think
 does


the
 best


after
 hours?


>> I
 think
 um
 man,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 want
 to
 be


bullish
 Meta,
 but
 um
 I
 just
 I'm
 not
 too


confident
 on
 their
 margins
 this
 quarter.


um
 mostly
 because
 the
 copious
 amount
 of


spending
 they've
 been
 doing
 as
 far
 as


their
 free
 cash
 flow
 margins.
 Uh


operating
 margins
 is
 going
 to
 be
 set


aside
 from
 that
 because
 most
 of
 the


capex
 is
 attributed
 to
 cash
 flows
 on
 the


investing
 side
 versus
 like
 the
 operating


income.
 Um
 so
 maybe
 they'll
 be
 able
 to


sustain
 that
 but
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a


point
 in
 the
 next
 few
 years
 where
 capex


is
 going
 to
 equal
 equal
 operating
 cash


flow
 if
 not
 supersede
 it.
 Right?
 So
 if


that
 happens
 you
 know
 I
 hope
 people
 are


ready
 for
 that.
 the
 the
 ideal
 is
 invest


now,
 reap
 later.
 I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 Meta


might
 be
 like
 somewhat
 flat,
 maybe
 up
 a


little
 bit.
 Uh
 I
 think
 Microsoft
 is


going
 to
 do
 just
 fine.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 if


it's
 going
 to
 be
 up
 like
 5
 10%.
 But


dude,
 I
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 I
 I
 think


Google's
 going
 to
 go
 to
 300
 bucks
 only


because
 I
 don't
 own
 it
 anymore.


All
 right,
 here
 we
 go.
 2
 minutes.
 50%
 of


you
 are
 saying
 Google
 is
 going
 to
 do
 the


best
 equal
 split
 between
 25
 25
 on
 Meta.


Last
 question
 for
 everybody.
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 say
 to
 put
 the
 ticker
 in
 the


chat.
 Which
 one
 do
 you
 think
 would
 dump?


If
 you
 had
 to
 pick
 one
 to
 dump
 out
 of


all
 three,
 put
 in
 the
 chat
 which
 one
 do


you
 think?


>> Man,
 I
 I
 have
 a
 feeling
 Meta
 just
 might


not
 surprise
 the
 upside.
 If
 it
 does,


great.
 If
 it
 does
 If
 it
 does
 great,
 I


have
 a
 position
 in
 Meta.
 But


>> I
 felt
 the
 same
 about
 Meta
 last
 time
 and


then
 Zucks
 just
 demolished.
 Like
 how


would
 I
 even
 you
 know
 but
 like
 now
 I


don't
 know
 this
 this
 is
 why
 your
 stomach


turns
 and
 it's
 gut-wrenching
 but


>> it's
 crazy
 man


>> I
 think
 Microsoft
 could
 be
 the
 dark


horse
 I
 think
 Microsoft
 could
 be
 the
 one


that
 surprises
 a
 lot
 of
 people


>> if
 Microsoft
 surprises
 the
 upside
 the


market
 is
 just
 going
 to
 go
 up
 like
 a
 lot


right
 meta
 what
 is
 it
 like$2
 billion
 $2


trillion
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 less
 like


that's
 not
 going
 to
 move
 the
 markets
 if


Microsoft
 goes
 up
 that
 will
 move
 the


markets
 and
 if
 it's
 cloud


it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 fun
 ride.


>> All right,
 here
 we
 go,
 folks.
 We
 got


about
 30
 seconds.
 I
 will
 ring
 the
 bell


as
 we
 close
 out
 the
 day.
 We
 got
 25
 bips.


We
 will
 have
 all
 three
 earnings
 and
 a


lot
 of
 other
 companies.
 It's
 going
 to
 be


a
 bit
 madness
 after
 the
 bell.
 I
 will
 try


to
 get
 the
 numbers
 as
 quick
 as
 I
 can
 on


all
 of
 them
 and
 flip
 through
 each
 of
 the


stocks
 and
 see
 what
 reactions
 we're


getting.
 But
 it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 pretty


big
 day
 for
 the
 equity
 markets.
 Just


remember,
 regardless
 of
 what
 happens
 up


or
 down,
 we
 are
 all
 winners
 for
 actually


caring
 about
 trying
 to
 achieve
 some


level
 of
 financial
 freedom
 by
 allocating


capital.
 Uh
 it's
 not
 something
 that


everyone
 does,
 but
 the
 fact
 that
 we're


all
 doing
 it
 is
 very,
 very
 special.


Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.

Let's
 see.
 Googs

before
 the
 other

 She's
 moving.


She

 I
 think.
 Yep,
 there
 she's


moving.
 All right,
 we're
 gonna
 see.
 I


will
 get
 the
 numbers
 as
 soon
 as
 I
 can.


And
 we're
 gonna
 see
 what
 we
 got.
 Googs


usually
 happens
 immediately.

 don't
 see
 any
 crazy
 new
 moves


after
 hours.
 We
 got
 to
 pay
 attention
 to


Nvidia
 as
 well
 as
 we're
 looking
 at
 all


these
 companies.
 Teddoc,
 eBay,
 KAC,


another
 semiconductor
 name.
 And
 then


Service
 Now
 and
 Software.
 Mart
 Libre
 is


up
 right
 there.
 And
 then
 Starbucks,


that's
 down.
 Google
 276.
 You're
 getting


a
 bit
 of
 a
 candle.
 Nothing
 too
 crazy,


but
 the
 numbers


are
 not
 in
 yet.
 Yeah,
 S&P
 did
 go
 green.


S&P
 did
 go
 green
 on
 the
 close.
 Falling


knife,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $200
 super


chat.
 You
 did
 not
 need
 to
 send
 that.


Deeply,
 deeply
 appreciate
 you,
 man.


Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 And
 thank
 you


for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Also,
 Muckabe,
 thank


you
 for
 the
 super
 chat
 as
 well,
 man.
 Uh


just
 for
 being
 here
 with
 me.
 Couldn't
 do


this
 alone.
 Appreciate
 you
 guys.
 I'm


just
 very
 happy
 that
 people
 chose
 to
 be


here
 all
 day
 with
 me
 and
 we
 got
 to
 do


this
 together.
 So,
 thank
 you
 all
 for


being
 here.
 Googs
 280.
 All
 right,
 we're


getting
 the
 move.
 We're
 getting
 a
 move.


280.
 281
 282
 283
 284.
 Oh
 my
 goodness.


How
 big
 of
 a
 beat
 was
 this?
 How
 big?
 I


don't
 have
 the
 numbers
 yet
 on
 googs.
 I


don't
 have
 it
 yet.
 I
 don't
 have
 it
 yet.


Streets
 got
 to
 like
 it
 for
 a
 280
 move.


282


Street's
 got
 to
 be
 happy
 with
 it
 if


they're
 giving
 it
 that
 much
 of
 a
 move


right
 now.
 Let's
 see
 if
 I
 can
 pull
 this


up.
 I
 got
 Micardo
 Libre
 numbers.
 It


looks
 like
 a
 beat
 and
 a
 miss
 from


Ricardo
 Libre.
 Don't
 have
 Google
 yet.


281.


She's
 holding
 280
 again.
 The
 stock
 was


stuck
 at
 150
 for
 like
 nine
 months.
 So,


this
 is
 a
 big
 one.
 Oh
 my
 goodness.


26%


beat.


Oh
 my
 goodness.
 287
 versus
 227.


That's
 almost
 a
 30%
 beat.
 Revenue
 102


versus
 100.
 That's
 a
 $2
 billion
 beat
 on


revenue.
 Google's
 at
 285.
 Google
 is
 at


285.


It
 looks
 like
 she
 wants
 300o
 end
 of


year,
 maybe
 earlier
 than
 that.
 My


goodness,
 26%
 beat
 for
 a
 $3.2
 trillion


company.
 That
 means


>> that's
 pretty
 insane.


>> Completely
 underestimated
 what
 Google


would
 put
 up.


>> Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up.


>> Microsoft
 and
 Meta
 I
 don't
 have
 yet,
 but


Google
 just
 making
 a
 massive
 move
 right


here.


>> Yep.
 Oh,
 Micros
 285
 still
 moving.
 There


you
 go.
 284.
 Wow.
 Microsoft's
 dumping.


Are
 we
 actually
 dumping?
 Microsoft
 is


dumping.
 Microsoft
 is
 dumping.
 Microsoft


is
 down
 4%.


Wow.
 Google
 go
 up.
 Microsoft
 go
 down.


Let
 me
 see
 Microsoft
 numbers.
 We'll
 get


into
 the
 specifics
 of
 everything
 in
 a


second.
 Um,


Mardo
 Libre,
 by
 the
 way,
 they
 missed
 by


11%
 on
 EPS.
 They
 beat
 by
 3%
 on
 revenue.


Uh,
 Marta
 Libre
 is
 also
 down.
 Not
 down


like
 crazy,
 but
 they
 are
 down.
 Google


just
 hit
 289.
 Google
 just
 hit
 290.


Google
 just
 hit
 290.
 Microsoft
 just
 hit


below
 520.


Oh
 my
 goodness,
 dude.
 Up
 and
 down.
 That


is
 quite
 incredible.
 Uh
 EPS
 on


Microsoft.
 I
 think
 I
 have
 it.
 Do
 I
 have


Microsoft?
 Let
 me
 see.
 Do
 we
 have
 it?


Yeah.
 Okay.
 They
 beat
 by
 13%
 from


Microsoft
 on
 EPS.
 413
 versus
 366.


Uh
 that's
 a
 beat.
 And
 then
 revenue
 3%


77.6
 versus
 77.5
 or
 75.3
 billion.
 EPS
 is


up
 20%
 year-over-year.
 25%
 revenue
 was


up
 18%
 year-over-year.


Street
 doesn't
 like
 it.
 Street
 loves


Google.
 295.


Oh
 my
 goodness.


The
 guys,
 this
 was
 at
 150
 for
 9
 months.


If
 it
 goes
 to
 300,
 that
 is
 a
 double
 on
 a


$3
 trillion
 company
 in
 less
 than
 four


months.
 Forget
 less
 than
 four
 months.


They
 started
 moving
 closer
 to
 to
 to


September.
 It's
 less
 than
 three
 months.


292


on
 the
 googs
 hit
 295.
 Microsoft,
 this
 is


not
 a
 bad
 number
 on
 Microsoft.
 13%
 beat


is
 not
 something
 to
 scoff
 at.
 I
 guess


the
 street
 thought,
 you
 know,
 they
 could


get
 a
 20%
 beat
 like
 Google.
 77.6
 versus


75
 billion
 on
 revenue.
 Meta,
 let
 me
 see


if
 I
 have
 Meta.
 Meta's
 dumping.
 Oh
 boy.


I
 kind
 of
 had
 a
 feeling
 about
 Meta


dumping.
 Kind
 of
 had
 a
 feeling
 about


that.
 There
 you
 go.
 728
 on
 Meta.


Uh,
 let's
 see.
 Meta's
 numbers.
 Don't


have
 them
 yet.
 Should
 be
 getting
 them
 in


a
 second.


Meta.


>> Do
 they
 say
 capbacks
 in
 the
 earnings


calls?
 Oh,
 wait.
 No,
 they
 should
 be
 on


the
 sheets.


>> Yeah,
 and
 I'll
 get
 the
 sheet
 in
 a
 second


to
 see
 uh
 Meta.


Hold
 on.
 There's
 no
 way
 these
 numbers


are
 true.
 I
 got
 to
 be
 looking
 at


something
 crazy.
 I'm
 looking
 at
 some


weird
 numbers.
 There's
 got
 to
 be


the
 numbers
 I'm
 looking
 at
 is
 looking


like
 they
 missed
 EPS
 by
 $5.
 There's
 no


way.
 Now
 granted,
 the
 stock's
 down
 heavy


right
 now,
 so
 maybe
 there
 is
 a
 way.
 Met


there's
 708.
 Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.


This
 one
 just
 getting
 wrecked.
 Um,


Google's
 300.
 Did
 we
 hit
 300?


Uh,
 I
 didn't
 see
 that.
 I
 saw
 295,
 not


300.
 Meta
 706.
 Meta
 and
 Microsoft


getting
 hit.
 Google
 going
 up.
 I'll
 try


to
 get
 the
 Microsoft
 numbers
 in
 a
 second


or
 the
 meta
 numbers,
 but
 let's
 get
 some


coverage
 real
 quick
 on
 Microsoft
 and


then
 let
 me
 get
 the
 uh
 the
 meta
 numbers


right
 here.


Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 now


from
 it
 being
 at
 a
 discount
 valuation


wise
 to
 the
 likes
 of
 Microsoft
 uh
 and


other
 comparable
 names.
 So
 I
 do
 think


that's
 why
 you
 have
 that
 a
 positive
 and


then
 you
 know
 the
 revenue
 acceleration


in
 cloud
 as
 Stephanie
 was
 saying
 is


something
 that
 is
 going
 to
 tell
 you
 that


we
 can
 still
 tolerate
 the
 the
 higher


capex


>> guys
 I
 think
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 the
 right


number
 what
 the
 either
 this
 is
 false
 or


an
 84%
 miss
 on
 EPS
 for
 Meta
 what


I
 guess
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 the
 right


numbers
 105
 versus
 667


51
 billion
 versus
 49
 billion.
 This
 has


to
 be
 an
 accounting
 thing.
 This
 has
 to


be
 accounting.
 This
 has
 to
 be
 they're


taking
 off
 a
 charge
 off
 or
 they're


they're
 they're
 they're
 uh
 engaging
 in
 a


charge
 off,
 goodwill
 impairment.
 There's


no
 way.
 Or
 if
 this
 is
 legit,
 and
 it's


not
 accounting,
 which
 I
 really
 do
 think


it's
 accounting.
 If
 it's
 legit,
 that


means
 they're
 spending
 a
 ridiculous


amount
 on
 labor
 and
 it's
 screwing
 their


margins.
 But
 there's
 no
 way
 it's


screwing
 it
 by
 84%.
 Like
 that
 makes
 no


sense.


But
 that's
 what
 you
 are
 looking
 at
 right


here
 on
 Meta.


Chad
 says
 they're
 writing
 off
 scale
 this


quickly.
 You
 know,
 we're
 laughing
 at


that.
 But
 theoretically,
 that's
 what
 a


miss
 like
 this
 implies,
 that
 they're


taking
 off
 a
 massive
 uh
 loss
 on
 their
 on


their
 investments.
 In
 this
 case,
 you


know,
 they
 put
 15
 billion
 into
 scale
 AI.


Maybe
 they're
 not
 getting
 the
 ROI
 right


here.
 695.
 We
 need
 some
 more
 details
 on


what's
 happening
 with
 Meta


GPUs.
 Okay.
 But
 they've
 been
 buying
 GPUs


for
 four
 years.
 This


>> so
 it
 says
 that
 they
 expect
 capex
 for


the
 year.
 So
 only
 one
 more
 quarter
 left


to
 be
 66
 to
 6
 to
 72
 narrowed
 from


previous
 outlook
 of
 64
 to
 72.
 So
 they


expect
 capex
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 higher


in
 the
 bottom
 range.


Capex
 didn't
 really
 change.
 Uh
 expect


another
 year
 of
 significant
 capital


exponential
 dollar
 growth
 in
 2026.
 They


don't
 give
 a
 number.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 The
 reason
 EPS
 is
 down,
 Meta


takes
 a
 15.93
 billion
 non-cash
 charge
 on


their
 tax
 bill.


What
 are
 they
 doing
 writing
 off
 15


billion?


>> I
 got
 a
 billion.


>> No,
 15.9
 billion.


>> Billion.


>> Let's
 get
 some
 coverage
 on
 uh
 on
 Meta.


>> Is
 down
 seven
 or
 so%.


>> Well,
 earnings
 and
 revenue
 both
 beat


expectations.
 Adjusted
 earnings
 of


$7.25.
 That's
 ahead
 of
 estimates
 of
 669,


but
 that
 includes
 a
 one
 tax
 onetime


non-cash
 income
 tax
 charge
 of
 $15.9


billion.
 Um,
 but
 that
 without
 that


one-time
 charge,
 which
 is
 due
 to
 the
 big


beautiful
 bill,
 um,
 President
 Trump's


big
 beautiful
 deal
 bill
 that
 would
 have


been
 an
 EPS.
 Revenues
 also
 ahead
 of


estimates,
 daily
 active
 people
 um,
 ahead


of
 estimates
 3.54
 billion
 versus
 3.49


billion
 estimated.
 and
 the
 average
 price


per
 ad
 was
 up
 10%
 in
 the
 quarter
 versus


an
 11%
 gain
 that
 the
 street
 uh
 uh
 street


account
 estimate
 um
 had
 anticipated.


Now,
 in
 terms
 of
 Q4
 revenues,
 the


company's
 guiding
 to
 Q4
 revenues
 between


56
 billion
 and
 59
 billion
 that
 compares


to
 the
 57.25
 25
 billion
 estimated.
 And


they
 say
 the
 outlook
 reflects
 an
 an


expectation
 for
 continued
 strong
 ad


revenue
 growth
 partially
 offset
 by
 lower


year-over-year
 reality
 labs
 revenue
 in


the
 fourth
 quarter.
 We're
 going
 to


continue
 to
 dig
 into
 this.
 Um
 does
 seem


like
 everyone
 is
 working.


>> Did
 anyone
 catch
 what
 she
 said?
 What


what
 was
 in
 the
 big
 beautiful
 bill
 that


caused


this
 $15
 billion?
 I'm
 going
 to
 listen
 to


it
 one
 more
 time.
 I
 got
 to
 hear
 that.


I'm
 still
 confused
 why
 they
 were
 able
 to


take
 that
 that
 much
 of
 a
 if
 they
 didn't


have
 this,
 they
 would
 have
 beat
 EPS
 by


about
 10%.


>> Revenue
 both
 beat
 expectations.
 Adjusted


earnings
 of
 $7.25.
 That's
 ahead
 of


estimates
 of
 $669,
 but
 that
 includes
 a


one
 tax
 onetime
 non-cash
 income
 tax


charge
 of
 15.9
 billion.


>> One
 time
 non-income
 tax
 charge
 of
 15.9


billion
 from
 the
 big
 beautiful
 billion


dollars.
 Um
 but
 that


>> okay
 so
 without
 that
 Meta
 would
 be
 up


698
 after
 hours.
 Google
 still
 moving
 285


but
 it
 looks
 like
 that's
 the
 story
 on


Meta.
 That's
 why
 that's
 getting
 hit.


Microsoft
 also
 still
 getting
 hit.


Microsoft
 uh
 down
 about
 4%
 right
 here.
 A


little
 bit
 of
 recovery
 but
 Microsoft
 is


still
 down.
 Jose,
 welcome.


>> What's
 going
 on
 man?
 Seems
 like
 I
 missed


so
 much
 already
 and
 it's
 only
 been
 10


minutes
 since
 the
 market
 closed.
 What's


up
 Jose?


>> What's
 going
 on
 Sam?


Let's
 get
 some
 coverage
 on
 Google
 here


and
 then
 we'll
 try
 to
 dive
 deeper
 into


these
 numbers
 as
 well.


>> Some
 more
 details
 on
 that
 report.
 Mac,


>> hey
 there,
 John.
 So,
 one
 number
 that
 we


were
 looking
 out
 for
 is
 its
 fullear


capex
 guide.
 It's
 now
 ranging
 between
 91


billion
 and
 $93
 billion.
 That
 puts
 it


very
 close
 to
 the
 numbers
 that
 we've


seen
 from
 Microsoft
 and
 Amazon,
 the
 two


biggest
 spenders
 in
 that
 cloud
 war.


They've
 got
 capex
 commitments
 of
 around


hundred
 billion.
 It's
 backlog
 numbers,


so
 that's
 the
 best
 indicator
 of
 future


revenue.
 That's
 coming
 in
 at
 $155


billion.
 Also
 key
 here,
 it's
 Gemini
 app,


which
 goes
 head-to-head
 with
 OpenAI's


Chat
 GBT.
 It's
 looking
 at
 monthly
 active


users
 of
 600
 650
 million
 versus


>> Wow,


that's
 a
 big
 one.
 That's
 a
 big
 jump.


650.
 ChatBT
 is
 at
 800.


>> This
 is
 OpenAI's
 800
 million.
 I
 want
 to


bring
 you
 that
 allimportant
 search
 and


other
 revenue
 number.
 This
 is
 its
 cash


cow
 for
 the
 company.
 We're
 looking
 at
 uh


56.57
 billion
 for
 that
 segment,
 beating


estimates
 of
 55.1
 billion.
 Uh
 we
 are


seeing
 a
 miss
 in
 its
 other
 bets
 revenue.


That's
 344
 uh
 million
 versus
 the
 433.1


million.
 That's
 where
 its
 Whimo
 business


lives.
 One
 other
 thing
 for
 you
 I've
 got


John
 is
 your
 Q2
 uh
 your
 Q3
 YouTube


revenue.
 That's
 beating
 estimates
 at


10.26
 billion
 versus
 the
 10.01
 billion


expected.
 And
 last
 thing
 I'll
 say
 for


you,
 that
 cloud
 revenue
 growth,
 that


percentage
 growth
 34%
 higher
 from
 a
 year


earlier
 to
 that
 51
 uh
 15.16
 billion
 as


it
 looks
 to
 come
 up
 the
 ranks
 from
 that


third
 place
 position.
 Back
 to
 you
 guys.


>> Okay,
 McKenzie,
 thank
 you.
 Those
 shares


are
 up
 almost
 4%.


>> Jose,
 any
 quick
 thoughts
 on
 those


numbers?


>> Did
 I
 miss
 something?
 Did
 they
 increase


capex?
 She
 mentioned
 91
 to
 93
 billion.


Last
 quarter
 we
 saw
 it
 was
 85
 billion
 um


for
 for
 Google.
 Uh,
 so
 it
 does
 seem
 like


a
 nice
 capbased
 growth
 here.
 Um,
 so
 I'm


I'm
 pretty
 excited
 about
 that.
 Uh,
 so


again,
 just
 jumping
 in
 here,
 but
 that


was
 the
 first
 thing
 that
 grabbed
 my


attention
 if
 those
 numbers
 are
 true.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 they're
 looking
 at
 like


they
 could
 be
 just
 looking
 at
 the
 next


12
 months
 based
 on
 current
 numbers
 or
 if


they
 actually
 increased
 their
 guidance.


I
 I
 I
 do
 think
 they
 actually
 did.
 She


said
 it
 came
 in
 line
 with
 what
 the


street
 was
 expecting.
 So
 it
 looks
 like


it's
 a
 $5
 billion
 increase.
 We'll


confirm
 that,
 but
 it
 seems
 like
 that
 is


the
 case.
 Google
 doing
 the
 best
 after


all
 these
 earnings
 at
 286.
 Meta
 is


starting
 to
 recover
 a
 bit.
 I
 still
 don't


know
 exactly
 what
 the
 big
 beautiful
 bill


had
 to
 do
 with
 this
 $15
 billion
 charge


off,
 but
 without
 it
 they
 would
 have
 beat


EPS
 uh
 and
 it
 would
 have
 came
 in
 at
 725.


Street
 was
 expecting
 667.
 So
 if
 they


came
 in
 at
 725,


then
 technically
 Meta
 would
 have
 had
 a


9%
 beat.
 So
 if
 Meta
 had
 just
 not
 had


that
 charge
 off,
 which
 I
 think
 the


street
 can
 ignore
 that
 I
 mean
 the
 ALOS


are
 not
 going
 to
 ignore
 it,
 but
 maybe


that
 shouldn't
 be
 something
 that
 has


that
 much
 of
 an
 impact.
 Microsoft
 right


here,
 I
 want
 to
 get
 it
 deeper
 into


Microsoft's
 cloud
 revenues,
 and
 we'll


pull
 that
 up
 in
 a
 second
 because
 that's


the
 big
 story
 for
 Microsoft
 real
 quick


before
 that.
 Service
 Now,
 they
 beat
 on


the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom
 482
 versus
 427


beat
 by
 12%.
 Revenue
 beat
 by
 1.4%.


Service
 Now,
 that
 stock
 is
 up
 about
 2%


after
 hours.
 And
 then
 you
 have
 Carvana,


they
 missed
 on
 EPS.
 We're
 seeing
 a
 lot


of
 different
 stuff
 happen
 in
 the
 uh
 car


market
 with
 delinquencies.
 137
 versus


103
 revenue.
 They
 beat
 565
 versus
 501.


So
 that
 stock
 is


down
 even
 though
 they
 beat
 on
 revenues.


Uh
 Google's
 going to
 be
 starting
 at
 4:30


guys.
 So
 in
 15
 minutes
 we'll
 open
 up


Google.
 Uh
 we'll
 get
 to
 Meta
 and


Microsoft
 once
 Google
 is
 done.
 But
 all


three
 of
 these
 calls
 will
 be
 happening


at
 the
 same
 time.
 So
 we'll
 try
 to
 get


updates.


>> Transmetics
 uh
 reported
 too
 apparently.


TMDX


>> down
 10%.


>> Down.
 Okay,
 they
 beat
 by
 83%
 on
 EPS,


missed
 by
 1%
 on
 revenue.
 That
 stock
 is


indeed
 down
 10%.
 But
 at least
 you're


seeing
 that
 topline
 beat
 or
 the
 bottom


line
 beat,
 which
 is
 important.
 Uh


Chipotle
 just
 reported,
 let
 me
 pull
 that

 we'll
 get

 here.

That's

 with
 the

 of

Now,
 CEO
 Scott
 Boatright
 telling
 me
 in
 a


CNBC
 exclusive
 interview
 that
 younger


consumers
 under
 100k
 annual
 income
 are


pulling
 back
 a
 bit
 in
 the
 quarter.
 Take


a
 listen.


>> We've
 seen
 a
 pretty
 sizable
 step
 down
 in


the
 consumer
 that's
 under
 $100,000
 in


annual
 income.
 Specific
 to
 that
 is
 a


group
 uh
 the
 25
 to
 34
 year old
 which
 we


overindex
 to
 has
 pulled
 back
 measurably


and
 we
 believe
 that


>> that
 is
 the
 first
 time
 we're
 hearing


from
 a
 restaurant
 that
 a
 consumer
 making


less
 than
 100k
 they
 are
 seeing
 less
 foot


traffic
 for.
 So
 that
 is
 definitely


something
 all
 of
 us
 have
 to
 pay


attention
 to.
 If
 that's
 happening
 at


Chipotle
 that's
 probably
 happening
 at


other
 restaurants
 and
 it's
 showing
 a
 bit


of
 a
 bifurcation
 within
 the
 labor
 market


and
 obviously
 people
 that
 are
 just


starting
 out
 their
 careers.
 I
 mean,
 if


they're
 not
 eating
 at
 Chipotle,
 then,


you
 know,
 either
 Chipotle
 is
 too
 pricey


or
 there
 there
 are
 some
 issues
 with


their
 income
 that
 isn't
 allowing
 them
 to


afford
 Chipotle.
 So,
 that
 is
 a
 bit
 of


news
 that's
 important
 for
 the
 consumer.


Chipotle
 right
 there
 down
 1%.
 Google


still
 holding
 its
 move
 28871.


Chipotle's
 just
 mid.
 Okay.


>> It's
 crazy
 with
 Google,
 right?
 First
 100


billion
 quarter.
 That's
 wild
 on
 revenue.


Um
 I
 I


>> the
 first
 Google
 $100
 billion
 revenue


quarter.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 they
 just
 me


they
 they
 mentioned
 on
 their
 uh
 press


release
 here.
 Um
 we
 delivered
 our
 first


ever
 $100
 billion
 quarter.


>> Okay,
 so
 let
 me
 pull
 it
 up
 right
 here


real
 quick.
 This
 is
 Microsoft.
 So
 we
 are


looking
 at
 on
 cloud
 49.1
 billion.

 net
 income.


Microsoft
 did
 about
 $28
 billion
 of


profits.
 I
 guess
 the
 street
 wanted


something
 a
 bit
 higher
 than
 Google
 right


there
 at
 290.
 Here
 is
 what
 Sundar
 said.


Alphabet
 had
 a
 terrific
 quarter
 with


double
 digit
 growth
 across
 every
 part
 of


our
 business.
 We
 delivered
 our
 first


ever
 hundred
 billion
 dollar
 quarter.
 Our


full
 stack
 approach
 to
 AI
 is
 delivering


strong
 momentum
 and
 we're
 shipping
 at


speed,
 including
 the
 global
 rollout
 of


AI
 overviews
 and
 AI
 mode
 in
 search
 in


record
 time.
 In
 addition
 to
 topping


leaderboards,
 our
 firstparty
 models
 like


Gemini
 now
 process
 7
 billion
 tokens
 a


minute
 via
 direct
 API
 use
 by
 our


customers.
 The
 Gemini
 app
 now
 has
 over


650
 million
 monthly
 active
 users.
 By
 the


way,
 three
 months
 ago
 that
 was
 450


million.
 So
 that's
 up
 200
 million.
 We


continue
 to
 drive
 strong
 growth
 in
 new


businesses.
 Google
 Cloud
 accelerated


ending
 the
 quarter
 with
 155
 billion
 in


backlog.
 And
 we
 have
 300
 million
 paid


subscribers
 led
 by
 Google
 One
 and


YouTube
 Premium.


Okay,
 not
 too
 bad.
 Uh
 Sam,
 any
 thoughts


on
 some
 of
 these
 Google
 numbers
 as
 we're


seeing
 it
 come
 through?


>> You
 know,
 I
 calculated
 that
 cloud


growth,
 it
 was
 28%.
 Um,
 which
 is
 still


pretty
 nice.
 I
 mean,
 they're
 getting


bigger,
 so
 lot
 of
 large
 numbers.
 Uh,
 but


I
 mean,
 like,
 what
 what
 can
 you
 say?


They're
 definitely
 winning
 the
 uh
 they


definitely
 win
 the
 LLM
 market.
 I
 I
 think


they're
 still
 number
 one,
 right?
 They


still
 the
 number
 one
 LLM
 in
 the
 world
 or


chatbot
 in
 the
 world.
 I
 think
 they're


probably
 going
 to
 continue
 doing
 so.
 If


you
 really
 think
 about
 a
 company
 that's


very
 experienced
 at
 monetizing
 search,


even
 even
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 AI
 search,
 at


some
 point
 they're
 going
 to
 start


monetizing
 that.
 This
 is
 the
 company,


right?
 So


I
 seeing
 a
 quarter
 like
 that,
 you're


seeing
 the
 money
 rotate
 pretty
 much
 out


of
 Meta,
 out
 of
 Microsoft.
 This
 is
 just


going
 by
 price
 action
 and
 going
 to


Google.
 That's
 just
 what
 it
 looks
 like


right
 now
 after
 hours
 because
 this
 is
 a


lot
 of
 money,
 dude.
 This
 is
 a
 lot
 of


money
 moving
 after
 hours
 and
 it's
 going


to
 go
 somewhere.
 So,
 so
 one
 of
 them
 had


to
 be
 up


>> and
 and
 and
 if
 we
 see
 I
 mean
 that
 cl
 the


slide
 with
 cloud
 um
 few
 things
 that


really
 caught
 my
 attention
 is
 um
 similar


type
 of
 revenue
 growth
 even
 though
 Sam


mentioned
 right
 the
 law
 of
 of
 large


numbers
 they
 still
 last
 year
 they
 grew


35%
 still
 they're
 growing
 34%


I'm
 going
 to
 guess
 due
 to
 this
 massive


demand
 in
 AI
 solutions
 and
 AI
 cloud


infrastructure
 u
 but
 more
 importantly
 if


you
 look
 at
 that
 operating
 margins
 uh


>> yeah
 yeah


>> huge
 growth
 I
 I
 mean
 huge
 growth
 Yeah,


now
 23.7%


uh
 about
 200
 uh
 two
 billion
 now
 3.6.


>> How
 do
 you
 think
 Google
 increased
 that


by
 6%.
 Just
 more
 efficiencies
 because


that
 is
 impressive
 dude.


>> So
 cloud
 is
 um
 you
 reduce
 overhead
 as


you
 scale
 out.
 So
 the
 larger
 you
 get
 the


more
 your
 operating
 margins
 go
 up
 like


AWS
 is
 like
 around
 30
 31.5%
 or
 something


last
 quarter.
 So
 it's
 no
 surprise
 the


bigger
 that
 they
 get
 the
 more
 efficient


they
 get
 because
 it's
 just
 you
 don't


need
 to
 multiply
 how
 many
 engineers
 you


have
 when
 you
 have
 when
 you're
 just


automating
 the
 whole
 thing.
 Wait,
 so


they
 grew
 at
 35%
 their
 cloud?


>> 34.


>> Oh
 wow.
 34%.
 That's
 actually
 pretty


good.
 That's
 so
 that's
 pretty
 good.


That's
 pretty
 good.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 and
 also
 just
 with
 the


overall
 kind
 of
 in
 AI
 infrastructure


utilization,
 right?
 If
 you
 you
 have
 one


server,
 but
 the
 that
 one
 server
 is
 being


used
 100%
 of
 the
 time,
 you're
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 increase
 on
 your
 margins


dramatically
 faster
 than
 if
 you
 had
 that


same
 server
 only
 running
 80%
 of
 the
 time


or
 70%
 of
 the
 time.
 So,
 uh
 pricing
 power


there
 on
 the
 cloud
 aspect,
 but
 also
 the


utilization
 rate
 um
 are
 are are
 two


things
 that
 I
 think
 can
 help
 accelerate


that
 number
 uh
 pretty
 nicely.


>> I
 agree.
 Google
 right
 there
 at
 290.
 Uh,


I'm
 gonna
 pull
 up
 Google
 Q2
 2025
 real


quick
 and
 compare
 what
 Sundar
 said.
 So,


it
 looks
 like
 it
 looks
 like
 you're


right,
 Jose.
 They
 did
 increase.
 Yeah,


look
 at
 this.
 So,
 so
 they
 said
 85


billion.
 This
 is
 Q2.
 This
 was
 three


months
 ago.
 The
 most
 recent
 quarter
 is


91
 to
 93.
 That's
 an
 increase.
 So
 on
 the


high
 end,
 that's
 an
 eight
 billion


increase
 on
 capex.
 If
 if


>> others


>> that
 is
 so
 bullish
 your
 data
 center


stocks,
 that's
 what
 you
 want
 to
 see.


>> Nvidia
 right
 there
 207
 some
 of
 the
 other


data
 center
 names
 after
 hours
 moving
 a


little
 bit.
 Nebus
 and
 Core


>> I
 curious
 to
 see
 how
 Broadcom
 because


obviously
 Broadcom
 is
 one
 of
 the
 ones


that
 make
 with
 TPUs
 usually
 they
 kind
 of


move
 um
 with
 Capix
 a
 little bit
 more


than
 Nvidia.
 Um
 any
 movement?
 No,
 I


don't
 don't
 see
 much.
 pretty
 much
 flat


from
 from
 close.
 But
 yeah,


>> it
 did
 hit
 an
 alltime
 high
 today,
 which


is
 crazy,
 right?


>> Um,
 Jose,
 your
 reaction
 to
 Meta,
 let
 me


pull
 up
 Meta
 slides,
 but
 do
 you
 think


it's
 justified
 because
 of
 this
 tax
 miss


that
 they
 have?


>> I
 I
 I
 had
 to
 read
 through
 it,
 but
 a
 tax


miss,
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 think
 would
 be


something
 that
 would
 create
 for
 me
 to


sell
 uh
 a
 meta.
 Uh,
 right.
 So,
 would


love
 to
 read
 more
 on
 if
 there's
 any


major
 changes.
 started
 slowing
 down
 in


was
 there
 any
 slowdown
 anywhere
 else?
 Um


but
 just
 there
 we
 see
 ad
 impressions


were
 up
 14%.
 We
 also
 saw
 kind
 of
 the


price
 increase.
 Um


>> yeah,
 you
 got
 average
 price
 per
 ad
 up
 10


or
 up
 10,
 impressions
 up
 14,
 and
 then


DAP
 still
 up
 8%.


>> In
 terms
 of
 daily
 active
 people,
 here's


what
 Meta
 said
 on
 this
 non-cash
 charge


impact.
 We
 expect
 a
 significant


reduction
 in
 our
 US
 federal
 cash
 tax


payments
 for
 the
 remainder
 of
 2025
 in


our
 future
 years
 due
 to
 the


implementation
 of
 the
 One
 Big
 Beautiful


Bill
 Act.
 However,
 the
 implementation


also
 led
 to
 the
 recognition
 of
 a


valuation
 allowance
 against
 their
 US


federal
 deferred
 tax
 assets
 reflected


the
 impact
 of
 US
 corporate
 alternative


minimum
 tax.
 As
 a
 result,
 the
 third


quarter
 2025
 provision
 for
 income
 taxes


includes
 a
 onetime
 non-cash
 income
 tax


charge
 of
 15.93
 billion.
 Excluding
 this


onetime
 t
 tax
 um
 or
 third
 quarter


effective
 tax
 rate
 would
 have
 decreased


to
 14%.
 Net
 income
 would
 have
 increased


to
 18.64
 billion
 and
 then
 diluted
 EPS


would
 have
 been
 725.
 Yeah,
 this
 seems


like
 a
 nothing
 burger.


>> Wait,
 so
 there
 they
 reduce
 their
 tax


payment.
 Is
 is
 that
 what
 they're
 saying?


So


>> I
 I
 didn't
 read


>> I
 am
 I
 am
 not
 an
 accountant,
 but
 from


what
 it
 seems
 like
 they're
 saying
 is


that
 they
 were
 deferring
 certain


payments
 based
 on
 the
 valuation
 against


different
 assets
 they
 had.
 The
 big


beautiful
 bill
 had
 some
 change
 up
 in


terms
 of
 how
 you're
 able
 to
 value
 those


assets
 and
 then
 how
 long
 you're
 able
 to


defer
 stuff.
 And
 that
 led
 to
 them


recognizing
 15.9
 billion
 in
 tax
 that


they
 had
 to
 pay.


>> Yeah.
 Because
 I
 I
 I
 know
 with
 the
 big


beautiful
 bill,
 one
 thing
 that
 you
 can


kind
 of
 write
 off
 right
 away
 was
 your
 AI


servers,
 right?
 Historically,
 you
 had


your
 AI
 servers.
 You
 you
 could
 you
 you


had
 to
 distribute
 it
 over,
 I
 think,


5year
 time
 frame
 or
 whatever
 time
 frame,


some
 longer
 time
 frame.
 But
 now
 with
 the


big
 beautiful
 bill,
 um
 you
 are
 able
 to


defer
 everything
 at
 once.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 that's
 what's
 happening
 here,
 but
 if


if
 there
 was
 any
 changes,
 I
 wonder
 if
 it


comes
 with
 with
 that
 aspect.
 And
 I
 would


have
 to
 do
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 research,


but
 that
 would
 be
 the
 first
 thing
 in
 my


mind.


>> Yeah,
 it
 it
 you
 know
 when
 Chad
 mentioned


scale
 AI,
 that's
 what
 it
 kind
 of
 sounds


like.
 It's
 almost
 sounds
 like
 exactly


what
 they
 invested
 in
 scale.
 I
 don't


know if
 the
 investment
 would
 mature
 so


quickly
 for
 them
 to
 defer
 the
 assets,


but
 15
 billion
 is
 what
 they
 put
 into


scale.
 It
 almost
 seems
 like
 that's
 what


they've
 had
 to
 pay.
 Maybe
 it's
 just
 a


coincidence
 that
 it
 was
 15
 billion,
 but


>> I
 wonder
 because
 I
 know
 the
 big


beautiful
 bill
 include
 just
 anything


pretty
 much
 research
 and
 development
 in


the
 AI
 aspect
 here
 in
 the
 United
 States.


So,
 I
 wonder
 if
 that
 was
 like
 you


mentioned
 with
 the
 scale
 AI
 if
 they
 were


able
 to
 just
 write
 it
 off.
 Again,
 that


>> knowledge
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 a
 tax
 person.
 Um,


but
 with
 the
 big
 beautiful
 bill,
 you
 you


were
 able
 to
 expense
 everything
 uh
 a
 lot


faster
 than
 than
 normal.


>> Street
 really
 doesn't
 like
 it.
 I
 mean,


outside
 of
 that,
 I
 don't
 see
 anything


else
 that
 we
 should
 be
 upset
 about.


Revenue
 is
 up
 26%,
 guys.
 This
 is
 a
 $2


trillion
 company.
 That
 is
 not
 small


growth.


uh
 uh
 income
 from
 operations
 up
 18%.


Operating
 margins
 increased
 well


decreased
 slightly
 but
 at
 a
 at
 a
 far


lower
 rate
 than
 their
 revenue
 growth.


Net
 income
 that
 is
 up
 again
 because
 of


that
 15
 billion
 that's
 what
 takes
 it


down
 but
 if
 it
 wasn't
 it
 would
 be
 up


almost
 30%
 year-over-year
 and
 you're


seeing
 broader
 growth
 outside
 of
 the


other
 parts
 of
 the
 business.
 Meta
 said


we
 had
 a
 strong
 quarter
 for
 our
 business


and
 community.
 Meta
 Super
 Intelligence


Labs
 is
 off
 to
 a
 great
 start
 and
 we


continue
 to
 lead
 the
 industry
 in
 AI


glasses.
 If
 we
 deliver
 even
 a
 fraction


of
 the
 opportunity
 ahead,
 then
 the
 next


few
 years
 will
 be
 the
 most
 exciting


period
 in
 history.


>> Yeah,
 this
 doesn't
 feel
 that
 scary
 for


uh
 for
 Meta
 based
 on
 these
 numbers.


Let's
 get
 some
 coverage
 right
 here
 on


Microsoft
 and
 see
 what
 the
 street
 thinks


about
 this
 one.


>> Yes,
 the
 street
 one
 a
 little
 bit
 higher


on
 that
 growth
 that
 you
 just
 mentioned


and
 uh
 I
 think
 that's
 really
 largely
 it


all
 the
 other
 metrics
 look
 good.
 I
 think


the
 street's
 not
 picking
 up
 on
 the


booking
 and
 the
 the
 actual
 RPO.
 And
 if


you
 look
 at
 those
 numbers,
 you're


talking
 about
 a
 a
 commercial
 booking


number
 at
 112%
 of
 50
 plus%
 growth
 in


RPO.
 Uh
 that's
 one
 of the
 best
 growth


rates
 rates
 we've
 ever
 seen.
 And
 that


does
 not
 include
 the
 new
 commitment
 from


OpenAI
 250
 billion
 incremental.
 So
 Open


AI
 helped
 them
 in
 the
 quarter,
 but
 all


this
 250
 billion
 is
 is
 not
 in
 that


number
 as
 they
 indicated
 in
 the
 release.


So
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 market's
 picking
 up


on
 that.
 So
 that
 to
 me
 is
 the
 future


indication
 of
 health
 of
 this
 company
 is


the
 just
 blew
 the
 doors
 off
 on
 RPO
 and


bookings
 growth
 which
 is
 again
 the
 the


most
 important
 thing
 that
 that
 we
 look


at
 as
 software
 analysts
 what's
 the


future
 indication
 of
 of
 health
 that's


that's
 it
 uh
 capex
 uh
 was
 a
 little
 bit


higher
 which
 everyone
 uh
 had
 expected


and
 you
 saw
 Google
 and
 meta
 also
 raise


their
 gu
 so
 everyone's
 asking
 what's


happening
 to
 capex
 we
 just
 got
 basically


a
 raise
 from
 all
 three
 uh
 from
 what
 we


can
 see
 and
 then
 when
 you
 think
 about


margins
 Everyone's
 like,
 "Well,
 how
 can


you
 make
 money
 in
 AI?"
 She
 put
 up
 Amy,


the
 CFO
 of
 Microsoft,
 put
 up
 better


margins
 than
 expected.
 So,
 this
 is


further
 indication
 that
 they're
 making


money
 on
 AI,
 that
 they're
 not
 uh


effectively,
 you
 know,
 losing
 uh
 capital


on
 on
 this
 investment.
 Uh
 they're


actually
 driving
 really
 good
 margin


improvement.


>> So,
 the
 stock
 down
 3%
 in
 overtime
 right


now,
 and
 I
 realize
 we
 still
 have
 to
 get


through
 a
 conference
 call
 here,
 too.
 Do


you
 buy
 on
 this
 dip?


>> We
 do.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 bookie
 number,


you
 know,
 you
 can't
 find
 too
 many


companies
 growing
 their
 their
 backlog
 uh


commercial
 backlog
 over
 100
 and
 their


RPO,
 which
 is
 the
 remaining
 performance


obligation
 over
 50.
 And
 that's
 an


indication
 of
 what's
 to
 come
 for
 the


next
 several
 quarters.
 So,
 we
 we're


buyers
 of
 Microsoft.


>> How
 does
 this
 speak
 to
 what
 we
 saw?


>> Okay,
 so
 Google
 actually
 delayed
 their


call,
 so
 we
 have
 some
 time.
 Uh


>> uh


>> oh,
 just
 kidding.


Um,
 usually
 Google
 does
 it
 at
 4:30.


They're
 doing
 it
 at
 5:30.
 I
 think
 Meta


we
 might
 actually
 get
 to
 start
 off
 with


first


as


uh
 Meta
 does
 it
 at
 5.


Uh,
 no,
 Meta
 is
 starting.


No,
 Meta
 is
 starting
 at
 4:30.
 Is
 that


Yeah,
 Meta
 start.


>> Oh,
 wow.
 Okay.
 Yeah,


>> I
 guess
 they
 did
 a
 switcheroo.


They
 also
 did
 a
 switcheroo
 on
 the
 stock


price.
 Last
 time
 Meta
 went
 up,
 Google


went
 down.
 This
 time
 Meta
 goes
 down,


Google's
 I
 guess
 they
 traded
 places.
 All


right,
 so
 for
 those
 that
 care
 about


Zucks,
 we're
 going to
 start
 off
 with


Zucks
 in
 a
 couple
 minutes.
 I
 mean,


overall,
 how
 is
 everyone
 feeling?
 It's


uh
 I
 mean,
 if
 you
 look,
 if
 you
 bet
 I


think
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 chat
 bet
 was


going
 to
 be
 the
 winner.
 Uh
 obviously


that
 has
 played
 out.
 290
 on
 the
 Googs.


Microsoft
 already
 recovering.
 I
 mean,


it's
 still
 down
 2%
 but
 it's
 not
 as
 ugly.


Meta,
 the
 tax
 thing
 is
 stupid,
 but


nonetheless,
 maybe
 there's
 a
 different


reason.
 The
 street's
 upset
 and
 that's


why
 it's
 down.


And
 that's
 what
 you
 got.
 eBay's
 down
 a


bit.
 Looks
 like
 they
 didn't
 have
 the


best
 earnings.
 Chipotle,
 again,
 I
 a
 lot


of
 you
 guys
 were
 asking,
 "How
 does


Chipotle
 know
 the
 amount
 of
 income
 they


of
 their
 users?"


>> I
 was
 curious
 about
 that,
 too.


>> I
 don't
 know
 either,
 bro.
 Like,
 that's
 a


good
 question.
 Like,
 how
 does
 he
 know


>> how
 are
 they
 collecting
 this
 info?


>> Do
 they
 like
 do
 they
 read
 your
 credit


card?
 Like,
 how
 do
 like
 how
 that
 Yeah.


How
 do
 they
 know?
 I
 guess
 the
 people
 in


their
 app
 maybe,
 but
 still.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 don't
 remember
 putting
 that
 in


the
 app.


I
 don't
 remember
 it
 being
 asking
 me.


Maybe
 it's
 by
 the
 demographics
 of
 where


the
 sto
 located.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 you
 ask


me
 like
 where
 Chipotle
 is
 usually


located.
 Usually
 located
 in
 kind
 of


middle
 class


>> everywhere.
 I
 mean,
 they're
 everywhere,


but
 the
 ones
 in
 like
 the
 middle
 class


areas
 are,
 from
 what
 I've
 seen
 is
 where


the
 cavas
 are,
 where
 all
 those
 nice


restaurants
 are.
 And
 it's
 like,
 dude,


Chipotle
 is
 like
 12
 bucks
 for
 a
 bowl


when
 it
 used
 to
 be
 like
 seven
 bucks.


>> I
 might
 as
 well just
 eat
 at
 a


restaurant,
 right?
 So,


>> and
 I
 thought
 they
 give
 you
 free
 guac


with
 the
 chips.
 Apparently,
 the
 guac
 is


actually
 I
 thought
 like
 I
 thought
 years


ago
 it
 used
 to
 be


>> Oh
 my
 goodness.
 That
 would
 be
 insane


giving
 guac
 for
 free.


>> Uh,
 real
 quick
 before
 Meta,
 this
 is


Starbucks


>> earnings
 to
 bring
 you.
 Starbucks
 results


are
 out.
 Kate
 Rogers
 has
 those
 numbers.


Hi
 Kate.
 Hey
 Morgan.
 So
 the
 stock
 a


little
 bit
 higher
 here
 as
 you
 can
 see
 by


more
 than
 one
 and
 a
 half
 percent.
 A


mixed
 fourth
 quarter
 for
 Starbucks.
 Uh


EPS
 a
 miss
 here.
 52
 cents
 adjusted


versus
 estimates
 of
 56
 cents.
 Revenues


though
 a
 beat
 9.6
 billion
 for
 the


quarter
 versus
 the
 9.35
 billion


estimated.
 And
 that's
 even
 with
 the


labor
 investments
 that
 the
 company
 is


making
 right
 now.
 Comps
 turning
 positive


globally.
 Q4
 comp
 sales
 up
 1%
 better


than
 the
 0.3%
 decline
 estimated.
 Q4


North
 American
 comp
 sales
 flat
 uh
 versus


0.9%
 estimates.
 Transactions
 declined
 in


North
 America,
 but
 noteworthy
 update


here.
 US
 comps
 did
 turn
 positive
 in


September
 as
 the
 company's
 back
 to


Starbucks
 plan
 take
 shape.
 Q4


international
 comp
 sales
 also
 better


than
 expected,
 up
 3%.
 Uh
 it's
 China,


same
 store
 sales,
 second
 home
 market


there
 also
 up
 2%.
 We're
 going
 to
 be


looking
 out
 for
 any
 guidance
 and
 any


updates
 on
 China
 and
 that
 market
 on
 the


earnings
 call,
 guys.
 We'll
 bring
 you


updates
 as
 we
 get
 them.
 Back
 over
 to


you.


>> Uh
 Kate,
 thank
 you.
 I
 do
 want
 to
 mention


so
 Starbucks
 not
 going
 as
 bad
 as


Chipotle.
 That
 stock
 basically
 flat.
 Um


but
 Chipotle
 is
 the
 one
 that's
 taking
 a


bigger
 bigger
 of
 a
 hit.


Okay,
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 with


earnings.
 Three
 most
 important
 companies


outside
 of
 Amazon
 and
 Apple
 reported.


Google
 just
 I
 mean
 this
 story
 is


remarkable.
 Google
 stock
 year
 to
 date


44%


bottomed
 in
 April
 around
 143
 came
 back


to
 150
 by
 June.


just
 a
 massive
 massive
 move.
 And
 then


Microsoft
 looks
 like
 cloud
 revenue
 was


just
 a
 little
 bit
 flat
 as
 Jeff
 was


saying
 and
 that's
 why
 it's
 taking
 a
 bit


of
 a
 hit
 but
 still
 up
 30%
 even
 with
 this


2%
 decline


that
 we're
 seeing
 after
 hours.


All
 right,
 here
 we
 go.
 Zox
 is
 starting.


Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up
 and
 then
 we
 will


switch
 over.


Joining
 me
 today
 are
 Mark
 Zuckerberg,


CEO,
 and
 Susan
 Lee,
 CFO.
 Our
 remarks


today
 will
 include
 forward-looking


statements
 which
 are
 based
 on


assumptions
 as
 of
 today.
 Actual
 results


may
 differ
 materially
 as
 a
 result
 of


various
 factors,
 including
 those
 set


forth
 in


>> amends
 also
 increased
 their
 capics.
 On


the
 lower
 end,


>> quarterly
 report
 on
 form
 10Q
 filed
 with


the
 SEC.
 We
 undertake
 no
 obligation
 to


update
 any
 forward-looking
 statement.


During
 this
 call,
 we
 will
 present
 both


GAAP
 and
 certain
 non-GAAP
 financial


measures.
 A
 reconciliation
 of
 GAAP
 to


non-GAAP
 measures
 is
 included
 in
 today's


earnings
 press
 release.
 The
 earnings


press
 release
 and
 an
 accompanying


investor
 presentation
 are
 available
 on


our
 website
 at
 investor.appa.com.


And
 now,
 I'd
 like
 to
 turn
 the
 call
 over


to
 Mark.


>> All
 right.
 Thanks,
 Ken.
 Thanks
 everyone


for
 joining
 today.
 We
 had
 another
 strong


quarter
 with
 3.5
 billion
 people
 using
 at


least
 one
 of
 our
 apps
 every
 day.


Instagram
 hit
 a
 major
 milestone
 with


three
 billion
 monthly
 activives.
 And


we're
 seeing
 good
 momentum
 across
 our


other
 apps
 as
 well,
 including
 threads,


which
 recently
 passed
 150
 million
 daily


activives
 and
 remains
 on
 track
 to
 become


the
 leader
 in
 its
 category.


I
 am
 very
 focused
 on
 establishing
 Meta


as
 the
 leading
 frontier
 AI
 lab,
 building


personal
 super
 intelligence
 for
 everyone


and
 delivering
 the
 app
 experiences
 and


computing
 devices
 that
 will
 improve
 the


lives
 of
 billions
 of
 people
 around
 the


world.
 Our
 approach
 of
 advancing


open-source
 AI
 means
 that
 when
 Meta


innovates,
 everyone
 benefits.
 Meta
 super


intelligence
 labs
 is
 off
 to
 a
 strong


start.
 I
 think
 that
 we've
 already
 built


the
 lab
 with
 the
 highest
 talent
 density


in
 the
 industry.
 We're
 heads
 down


developing
 our
 next
 generation
 of
 models


and
 products
 and
 I'm
 looking
 forward
 to


sharing
 more
 on
 that
 front
 over
 the


coming
 months.
 We're
 also
 building
 what


we
 expect
 to
 be
 an
 industry-leading


amount
 of
 compute.
 Now,
 there's
 a
 range


of
 timelines
 for
 when
 people
 think
 that


we're
 going
 to
 get
 super
 intelligence.


Some
 people
 think
 that
 we'll
 get
 there


in
 a
 few
 years.
 Others
 think
 it
 will
 be


five,
 seven
 years
 or
 or
 longer.
 Um,
 I


think
 that
 it's
 the
 right
 strategy
 to


aggressively
 frontload
 building
 capacity


so
 that
 way
 we're
 prepared
 for
 the
 most


optimistic
 cases.
 That
 way,
 if
 super


intelligence
 arrives
 sooner,
 we
 will
 be


ideally
 positioned
 for
 a
 generational


paradigm
 shift
 and
 many
 large


opportunities.
 If
 it
 takes
 longer,
 then


we'll
 use
 the
 extra
 compute
 to


accelerate
 our
 core
 business,
 which


continues
 to
 be
 able
 to
 profitably
 use


much
 more
 compute
 than
 we've
 been
 able


to
 throw
 at
 it.
 And
 we're
 seeing
 very


high
 demand
 for
 additional
 compute
 both


internally
 and
 externally.
 And
 in
 the


worst
 case
 uh
 we
 would
 just
 slow


building
 new
 infrastructure
 for
 some


period
 while
 we
 grow
 into
 what
 we
 build.


The
 upside
 is
 extremely
 high
 for
 both


our
 existing
 apps
 and
 new
 products
 and


businesses
 that
 are
 becoming
 possible
 to


build
 across
 Facebook,
 Instagram
 and


threads.
 Our
 AI
 recommendation
 systems


are
 delivering
 higher
 quality
 and
 more


relevant
 content,
 which
 led
 to
 5%
 more


time
 spent
 on
 Facebook
 in
 Q3
 and
 10%
 on


threads.
 Video
 is
 a
 particular
 bright


spot
 with
 video
 time
 spent
 on
 Instagram


up
 more
 than
 30%
 since
 last
 year.
 And
 as


video
 continues
 to
 grow
 across
 our
 apps,


Reels
 now
 has
 an
 annual
 run
 rate
 of
 over


$50
 billion.
 Improvements
 in
 our


recommendation
 systems
 will
 also
 become


even
 more
 leveraged
 as
 the
 volume
 of
 AI


created
 content
 grows.
 Social
 media
 has


gone
 through
 two
 eras
 so
 far.
 First
 was


when
 all
 content
 was
 from
 friends,


family,
 and
 accounts
 that
 you
 followed


directly.
 The
 second
 was
 when
 we
 added


all
 of
 the
 creator
 content.
 Now,
 as
 AI


makes
 it
 easier
 to
 create
 and
 remix


content,
 we're
 going
 to
 add
 yet
 another


huge
 corpus
 of
 content
 on
 top
 of
 those


recommendation
 systems
 that
 understand


all
 this
 content
 more
 deeply
 and
 can


show
 you
 the
 right
 content
 to
 help
 you


achieve
 your
 goals
 are
 going
 to
 be


increasingly
 valuable.


Our
 ads
 business
 continues
 to
 perform


very
 well,
 largely
 due
 to
 improvements


in
 our
 AI
 ranking
 systems
 as
 well.
 This


quarter,
 we
 saw
 meaningful
 advances
 from


unifying
 different
 models
 into
 simpler,


more
 general
 models,
 which
 drive
 both


better
 performance
 and
 efficiency.
 And


now,
 the
 annual
 run
 rate
 going
 through


our
 completely
 end-to-end
 AI
 powered
 ad


tools
 has
 passed
 $60
 billion.


Now,
 one
 way
 that
 I
 think
 about
 our


company
 overall
 is
 that
 there
 are
 three


giant
 transformers
 that
 run
 Facebook,


Instagram,
 and
 ads
 recommendations.
 We


have
 a
 very
 strong
 pipeline
 of
 lots
 of


ways
 to
 improve
 these
 models
 by


incorporating
 new
 AI
 advances
 and


capabilities.
 And
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 we


are
 also
 working
 on
 combining
 these


three
 major
 AI
 systems
 into
 a
 single


unified
 AI
 system
 that
 will
 effectively


run
 our
 family
 of
 apps
 and
 business.
 Uh


using
 increasing
 intelligence
 to
 improve


the
 trillions
 of
 recommendations
 that


we'll
 make
 for
 people
 every
 day.


I'm
 also
 very
 excited
 about
 the
 new


products
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


build.
 More
 than
 a
 billion
 monthly


activives
 already
 use
 Meta
 AI
 and
 we
 see


usage
 increase
 as
 we
 improve
 our


underlying
 models.
 Um
 I'm
 very
 excited


to
 get
 a
 frontier
 model
 into
 Meta
 AI
 and


I
 think
 that
 the
 opportunity
 there
 is


very
 large.
 The
 same
 goes
 for
 our


business
 AI.
 Every
 day,
 people
 have
 more


than
 one
 billion
 active
 threads
 with


business
 accounts
 across
 our
 uh


messaging
 platforms
 ranging
 from
 product


questions
 to
 customer
 support.
 Our


business
 AIS
 will
 enable
 tens
 of


millions
 of
 businesses
 to
 scale
 these


conversations
 and
 improve
 their
 sales
 at


low
 cost.
 And
 the
 better
 our
 models
 get,


the
 better
 this
 is
 going
 to
 work
 for
 all


businesses.


This
 quarter,
 we
 also
 launched
 Vibes,


which
 is
 the
 next
 generation
 of
 our
 AI


creation
 tools
 and
 content
 experiences.


Retention
 is
 looking
 good
 so
 far.
 Um,


and
 its
 usage
 keeps
 growing
 quickly
 week


over
 week.
 I'm
 looking
 forward
 to


ramping
 up
 the
 growth
 of
 Vibes
 over
 the


coming
 months.


More
 broadly,
 I
 think
 that
 Vibes
 is
 an


example
 of
 a
 new
 content
 type
 enabled
 by


AI,
 and
 I
 think
 that
 there
 are
 more


opportunities
 to
 build
 many
 more
 novel


types
 of
 content
 ahead.
 As
 well
 as
 our


new
 models
 become
 ready,
 I'm
 looking


forward
 to
 starting
 to
 show
 everyone


some
 of the
 new
 kinds
 of
 products
 that


we're
 working
 on.
 At
 Connect,
 uh,
 we


announced
 our
 2025
 line
 of
 AI
 glasses,


and
 the
 response
 so
 far
 has
 been
 great.


Uh,
 the
 new
 Rayban
 Metaglasses
 and


Oakley
 Meta
 Vanguards
 are
 both
 selling


well
 as
 people
 love
 the
 improved
 battery


life,
 camera
 resolution,
 new
 AI


capabilities,
 and
 the
 great
 design.
 And


there's
 our
 new
 Meta
 Rayband
 display


glasses,
 our
 first
 glasses
 with
 a
 high


resolution
 display
 and
 the
 meta
 neural


band
 to
 interact
 with
 them.
 They
 sold


out
 in
 uh
 almost
 every
 store
 within
 48


hours
 with
 demo
 slots
 fully
 booked


through
 the
 end
 of
 next
 month.
 Uh
 so


we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 invest
 in


increasing
 manufacturing
 and
 selling


more
 of
 those.
 Um
 this
 is
 an
 area
 where


we
 are
 clearly
 leading
 and
 have
 a
 huge


opportunity
 ahead.
 Taking
 a
 step
 back,


um,
 if
 we
 deliver
 even
 a
 fraction
 of
 the


opportunity
 ahead
 for
 our
 existing
 apps


and
 the
 new
 experiences
 that
 are


possible,
 then
 I
 think
 that
 the
 next
 few


years
 will
 be
 the
 most
 exciting
 period


in
 our
 history.
 We've
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 do.


Uh,
 but
 we're
 making
 real
 progress


delivering
 strong
 business
 results,


building
 the
 talent
 density
 and


infrastructure
 needed
 for
 the
 next
 era,


and
 leading
 the
 way
 on
 AI
 devices
 that


will
 define
 the
 next
 computing
 platform.


I'm
 proud
 of
 how
 our
 teams
 are
 rising
 to


the
 challenge
 and
 I'm
 grateful
 for
 their


dedication,
 hard
 work,
 and
 creativity.


As
 always,
 thank
 you
 all
 for
 being
 a


part
 of
 this
 journey
 with
 us.
 And
 now,


here's
 Susan.


>> Thanks,
 Mark,
 and
 good
 afternoon,


everyone.
 Let's
 begin
 with
 our
 segment


results.
 All
 comparisons
 are
 on
 a


year-over-year
 basis
 unless
 otherwise


noted.
 Our
 community
 across
 the
 family


of
 apps
 continues
 to
 grow
 and
 we


estimate
 more
 than
 3.5
 billion
 people


used
 at
 least
 one
 of
 our
 family
 of
 apps


on
 a
 daily
 basis
 in
 September.


Q3
 total
 family
 of
 apps
 revenue
 was


$50.8
 billion
 up
 26%
 year-over-year.


Q3
 family
 of
 apps
 ad
 revenue
 was
 $50.1


billion
 up
 26%
 or
 25%
 on
 a
 constant


currency
 basis.


In
 Q3,
 the
 total
 number
 of
 ad


impressions
 served
 across
 our
 services


increased
 14%.


Impression
 growth
 was
 healthy
 across
 all


regions,
 driven
 by
 engagement
 and
 user


growth,
 particularly
 on
 video
 surfaces.


The
 average
 price
 per
 ad
 increased
 10%


year-over-year,
 benefiting
 from


increased
 advertiser
 demand,
 largely


driven
 by
 improved
 ad
 performance.
 This


was
 partially
 offset
 by
 impression


growth
 particularly
 from
 lower


monetizing
 regions
 and
 surfaces.


Family
 of
 apps
 other
 revenue
 was
 $690


million
 up
 59%
 driven
 by
 WhatsApp
 paid


messaging
 revenue
 growth
 as
 well
 as


metaverified
 subscriptions.


Within
 our
 reality
 lab
 segment
 Q3


revenue
 was
 $470
 million,
 up
 74%


year-over-year.


The
 significant
 year-over-year
 growth
 in


Q3
 was
 partly
 due
 to
 retail
 partners


stocking
 up
 on
 Quest
 headsets
 ahead
 of


the
 holiday
 season.
 We
 did
 not
 have
 a


similar
 benefit
 in
 the
 third
 quarter
 of


last
 year
 since
 our
 Quest
 3S
 headset


launched
 in
 the
 fourth
 quarter
 of
 2024.


Aside
 from
 this,
 strong
 AI
 glasses


revenue
 also
 contributed
 to
 revenue


growth
 in
 Q3.


Moving
 now
 to
 our
 consolidated
 results.


Q3
 total
 revenue
 was
 51.2
 billion,
 up


26%
 or
 25%
 on
 a
 constant
 currency
 basis.


Q3
 total
 expenses
 were
 30.7
 billion,
 up


32%
 compared
 to
 last
 year.


Year-over-year
 expense
 growth


accelerated
 20
 percentage
 points
 from
 Q2


due
 primarily
 to
 three
 factors.
 First,


legal
 related
 expense
 growth
 was
 higher


than
 in
 Q2
 due
 to
 charges
 we
 recorded
 in


the
 third
 quarter
 as
 well
 as
 us
 lapping


a
 period
 of
 acrruel
 reversals
 in
 the


third
 quarter
 a
 year
 ago.


Second,
 employee
 compensation
 growth


accelerated
 driven
 by
 technical
 hires,


particularly
 AI
 talent.


Finally,
 growth
 in
 infrastructure
 costs


accelerated
 due
 to
 increased


infrastructure
 operating
 costs


associated
 with
 our
 expanded
 data
 center


fleet,
 depreciation
 on
 our
 incremental


capex
 spend,
 and
 thirdparty
 cloud
 spend.


We
 ended
 Q3
 with
 over
 78,400


employees,
 up
 8%
 year-over-year,
 driven


by
 hiring
 in
 priority
 areas
 of


monetization,
 infrastructure,
 reality


labs,
 meta,
 super
 intelligence
 labs,
 as


well
 as
 regulation
 and
 compliance.


Third
 quarter
 operating
 income
 was
 $20.5


billion,
 representing
 a
 40%
 operating


margin.
 Q3
 interest
 and
 other
 income
 was


$1.1
 billion
 driven
 primarily
 by


unrealized
 gains
 on
 our
 marketable


equity
 securities.


Our
 tax
 rate
 for
 the
 quarter
 was
 87%


which
 was
 unfavorably
 impacted
 by
 a


one-time
 non-cash
 reduction
 in
 deferred


tax
 assets
 that
 we
 no
 longer
 anticipate


using
 under
 new
 US
 tax
 law.
 Our
 tax
 rate


would
 have
 been
 14%
 excluding
 this


charge.
 Although
 the
 transition
 to
 the


new
 US
 tax
 law
 resulted
 in
 an
 accounting


charge
 in
 the
 third
 quarter,
 we
 continue


to
 expect
 we
 will
 recognize
 significant


cash
 tax
 savings
 for
 the
 remainder
 of


the
 current
 year
 and
 future
 years
 under


the
 new
 law.
 And
 this
 quarter's
 charge


reflects
 the
 total
 expected
 impact
 from


the
 transition
 to
 the
 new
 US
 tax
 law.


Net
 income
 was
 $2.7
 billion
 or
 $15
 per


share.
 Excluding
 the
 one-time
 tax


charge,
 our
 net
 income
 and
 EPS
 would


have
 been
 $18.6
 billion
 and
 $7.25


per
 share,
 respectively.


Capital
 expenditures,
 including


principal
 payments
 on
 finance
 leases,


were
 $19.4
 4
 billion
 driven
 by


investments
 in
 servers,
 data
 centers,


and
 network
 infrastructure.


Free
 cash
 flow
 was
 $10.6
 billion.
 We


repurchased
 $3.2
 billion
 of
 our
 class
 A


common
 stock
 and
 paid
 $1.3
 billion
 in


dividends
 to
 shareholders.


We
 ended
 the
 quarter
 with
 $44.4
 billion


in
 cash
 and
 marketable
 securities
 and


28.8
 billion
 in
 debt.


Turning
 now
 to
 the
 business
 outlook,


there
 are
 two
 primary
 factors
 that
 drive


our
 revenue
 performance.
 Our
 ability
 to


deliver
 engaging
 experiences
 for
 our


community
 and
 our
 effectiveness
 at


monetizing
 that
 engagement
 over
 time.
 On


the
 first,
 daily
 activives
 continue
 to


grow
 year-over-year
 across
 Facebook,


Instagram,
 and
 WhatsApp.
 We're


continuing
 to
 see
 improvements
 to
 our


products
 and
 recommendations
 drive


incremental
 engagement
 with


year-over-year
 growth
 in
 global
 time


spent
 accelerating
 on
 both
 Facebook
 and


Instagram
 in
 Q3.
 In
 the
 US,
 overall
 time


spent
 on
 Facebook
 and
 Instagram
 grew


double
 digits
 year-over-year,
 driven
 by


continued
 video
 strength
 as
 well
 as


healthy
 growth
 in
 non-video
 time
 on


Facebook.


The
 engagement
 gains
 continue
 to
 be


driven
 by
 product
 work
 and
 ongoing


improvements
 to
 our
 recommendation


systems
 as
 we
 optimize
 our
 model


architectures,
 implement
 advanced


modeling
 techniques,
 and
 integrate
 more


signals
 about
 people's
 interests.
 We


also
 continue
 to
 focus
 on
 increasing
 the


freshness
 of
 recommended
 content
 on


Facebook.
 Our
 systems
 are
 now
 surfacing


twice
 as
 many
 reels
 published
 that
 day


than
 at
 the
 start
 of
 the
 year.


Looking
 to
 2026,
 we
 expect
 to
 advance


our
 recommendation
 systems
 across


several
 dimensions.
 On
 Instagram,
 one


focus
 is
 evolving
 our
 systems
 to
 surface


content
 across
 a
 broader
 set
 of
 topics


that
 cater
 to
 the
 diverse
 interests
 of


each
 person.
 This
 follows
 a
 similar


approach
 we've
 implemented
 on
 Facebook


that
 has
 driven
 good
 results.


We
 also
 expect
 to
 make
 significant


progress
 on
 our
 longerterm
 ranking


innovations
 in
 2026.


We're
 seeing
 promising
 new
 results
 from


our
 research
 efforts
 to
 create


foundational
 ranking
 models
 and
 expect


the
 new
 model
 innovations
 we're


developing
 as
 part
 of
 this
 will
 enable


us
 to
 significantly
 scale
 up
 the
 amount


of
 data
 and
 compute
 we
 use
 to
 train
 our


recommendation
 models
 in
 2026,
 yielding


more
 relevant
 recommendations.


Another
 large
 focus
 next
 year
 is


leveraging
 LLMs
 to
 improve
 content


understanding.
 We
 expect
 this
 is
 going


to
 enable
 our
 systems
 to
 more
 precisely


label
 the
 keywords
 and
 topics
 within


videos
 and
 posts,
 which
 will
 allow
 our


systems
 to
 both
 develop
 deeper
 intuition


about
 a
 person's
 interests
 and
 retrieve


the
 content
 that
 matches
 them.


Finally,
 we're
 making
 good
 progress
 with


Meta
 AI
 and
 threads.
 The
 number
 of


people
 using
 Meta
 AI
 across
 our
 family


of
 apps
 continues
 to
 grow
 and
 we're


increasingly
 leveraging
 firstparty


content
 into
 Meta
 AI
 results
 with
 the


majority
 of
 Meta
 AI's
 responses
 to


Facebook
 deep
 dive
 queries
 in
 the
 US
 now


showing
 related
 reels.
 We're
 also
 seeing


a
 lot
 of
 traction
 with
 media
 generation.


People
 have
 created
 over
 20
 billion


images
 using
 our
 products.
 And
 since


launching
 Vibes
 within
 Meta
 AI
 in


September,
 we've
 seen
 media
 generation


in
 the
 app
 increase
 more
 than
 tenfold.


On
 threads,
 we
 see
 strong
 growth
 in
 both


daily
 activives
 and
 the
 depth
 of


engagement
 as
 we
 continue
 to
 improve


recommendations.


The
 ranking
 optimizations
 we
 made
 in
 Q3


alone
 drove
 a
 10%
 increase
 in
 time
 spent


on
 threads.
 We
 also
 continue
 to
 ship
 new


features
 including
 launching
 direct


messaging
 in
 Q3.
 So
 anyone
 on
 threads


can
 now
 message
 one
 another
 within
 the


app.


Now
 to
 the
 second
 driver
 of
 our
 revenue


performance,
 increasing
 monetization


efficiency.
 The
 first
 part
 of
 this
 work


is
 optimizing
 the
 level
 of
 ads
 within


organic
 engagement.
 We
 continue
 to


refine
 ad
 supply
 across
 each
 of
 our


major
 surfaces
 within
 Facebook
 and


Instagram
 to
 better
 deliver
 ads
 at
 the


time
 and
 place
 they
 are
 most
 relevant
 to


people.
 Longer
 term,
 we
 have
 exciting
 ad


supply
 opportunities
 on
 both
 threads
 and


WhatsApp
 status.
 Ads
 are
 now
 running


globally
 in
 feed
 on
 threads
 and
 we're


following
 our
 typical
 monetization


playbook
 of
 optimizing
 the
 ads
 formats


and
 performance
 before
 we
 ramp
 supply.


Within
 WhatsApp
 status,
 we're
 continuing


to
 gradually
 introduce
 ads
 and
 expect
 to


complete
 the
 roll
 out
 next
 year.
 The


second
 part
 of
 increasing
 monetization


efficiency
 is
 improving
 marketing


performance.


Advancing
 our
 ad
 systems
 remains
 a


critical
 aspect
 of
 this
 work
 and
 we
 are


driving
 performance
 gains
 through


ongoing
 improvements
 in
 our
 larger
 scale


ads
 ranking
 models.
 For
 example,
 we


continue
 to
 broaden
 the
 adoption
 of


Lattis,
 our
 unified
 model
 architecture.


In
 Q3,
 we
 rolled
 out
 Lattis
 to
 app
 ads


which
 drove
 a
 nearly
 3%
 gain
 in


conversions
 for
 that
 objective.


Since
 introducing
 Lattis
 back
 in
 2023,


along
 with
 other
 back-end
 improvements,


we
 have
 now
 cut
 the
 number
 of
 ads


ranking
 and
 recommendation
 models
 by


approximately
 100.
 As
 we
 consolidated


smaller
 and
 more
 specialized
 models
 into


larger
 ones
 that
 use
 the
 lattice


architecture
 to
 generalize
 learnings


across
 surfaces
 and
 objectives,
 we


continue
 to
 observe
 performance


improvements
 as
 we
 combine
 models
 and


expect
 to
 drive
 additional
 gains
 as
 we


consolidate
 another
 200
 models
 over
 the


coming
 years
 into
 a
 smaller
 number
 of


highly
 capable
 models.


In
 addition
 to
 advancing
 our


foundational
 ads
 models,
 we're


innovating
 on
 our
 runtime
 models
 we
 use


downstream
 of
 them
 for
 ads
 inference.


For
 example,
 we
 began
 piloting
 a
 new


runtime
 ads
 ranking
 model
 in
 Q3
 that


leverages
 more
 compute
 and
 data
 than
 our


prior
 models
 to
 select
 more
 relevant


ads.
 In
 testing,
 we've
 seen
 this
 new


model
 drive
 a
 more
 than
 2%
 lift
 in


conversions
 on
 Instagram.


We
 also
 significantly
 improved


performance
 of
 Andromeda
 in
 Q3
 by


combining
 models
 across
 retrieval
 and


early
 stage
 ranking
 into
 a
 single
 model,


driving
 a
 14%
 increase
 in
 ads
 quality
 on


Facebook
 surfaces.


Within
 our
 ads
 products,
 we're
 seeing


continued
 momentum
 with
 Advantage
 Plus.


In
 Q3,
 we
 completed
 the
 rollout
 of
 our


streamlined
 campaign
 creation
 flow
 for


Advantage
 Plus
 lead
 campaigns.
 So
 now


advertisers
 running
 sales
 app
 or
 lead


campaigns
 have
 end-to-end
 automation


turned
 on
 from
 the
 beginning,
 allowing


our
 systems
 to
 look
 across
 our
 platform


to
 optimize
 performance
 by
 automatically


choosing
 criteria
 like
 who
 to
 show
 the


ads
 to
 and
 where
 to
 show
 them.
 The


annual
 run
 rate
 of
 revenue
 running


through
 our
 end-to-end
 automated


solutions
 has
 now
 reached
 $60
 billion


following
 the
 implementation
 of
 the
 new


streamlined
 creation
 flow.
 As
 we


continue
 to
 see
 more
 advertisers


leverage
 the
 performance
 benefits
 of
 our


solutions


within
 our
 advantage
 plus
 creative


suite,
 the
 number
 of
 advertisers
 using


at
 least
 one
 of
 our
 video
 generation


features
 was
 up
 20%
 versus
 the
 prior


quarter
 as
 adoption
 of
 image
 animation


and
 video
 expansion
 continues
 to
 scale.


We've
 also
 added
 more
 generative
 AI


features
 to
 make
 it
 easier
 for


advertisers
 to
 optimize
 their
 ad


creatives
 and
 drive
 increased


performance.


In
 Q3,
 we
 introduced
 AI
 generated
 music,


so
 advertisers
 can
 have
 music
 generated


for
 their
 ad
 that
 aligns
 with
 the
 tone


and
 message
 of
 the
 creative.


Finally,
 business
 messaging
 remains
 a


significant
 opportunity
 for
 us.
 We're


seeing
 strong
 growth
 across
 our


portfolio
 of
 solutions,
 including
 with


click
 to
 WhatsApp
 ads,
 which
 grew


revenue
 60%
 year-over-year
 in
 Q3.
 We're


also
 making
 good
 progress
 on
 our


business
 AI
 efforts,
 where
 we've
 been


focused
 on
 building
 a
 turnkey
 AI
 that


helps
 businesses
 generate
 leads
 and


drive
 sales.
 We've
 been
 opening
 access


in
 recent
 months
 to
 more
 businesses


within
 our
 initial
 test
 markets,
 the


Philippines
 and
 Mexico,
 and
 have
 seen


strong
 usage
 with
 millions
 of


conversations
 between
 people
 and


business
 AIS
 taking
 place
 since
 July.


This
 month,
 we
 expanded
 availability


within
 WhatsApp
 and
 Messenger
 to
 all


eligible
 businesses
 in
 Mexico
 and
 the


Philippines,
 respectively.


In
 the
 US,
 we're
 also
 starting
 to
 roll


out
 the
 ability
 for
 merchants
 to
 add


their
 business
 AIS
 to
 their
 website
 so


we
 can
 support
 the
 full
 sale
 funnel
 from


ad
 to
 purchase.


Next,
 I
 would
 like
 to
 discuss
 our


approach
 to
 capital
 allocation.


Our
 primary
 focus
 is
 deploying
 capital


to
 support
 the
 company's
 highest
 order


priorities,
 including
 developing
 leading


AI
 products,
 models,
 and
 business


solutions.


As
 we
 make
 significant
 investments
 in


infrastructure
 to
 support
 this
 work,
 we


are
 focused
 on
 preserving
 maximum


long-term
 flexibility
 to
 ensure
 we
 can


meet
 our
 future
 capacity
 needs
 while


also
 being
 able
 to
 respond
 to
 how
 the


market
 develops
 in
 the
 years
 ahead.


We're
 doing
 so
 in
 several
 ways,


including
 staging
 data
 center
 sites
 so


we
 can
 spring
 up
 capacity
 quickly
 in


future
 years
 as
 we
 need
 it,
 as
 well
 as


establishing
 strategic
 partnerships
 that


give
 us
 option
 value
 for
 future
 compute


needs.
 The
 strong
 financial
 position
 and


cash
 generation
 of
 our
 business
 enable


us
 to
 make
 these
 investments
 while
 also


accessing
 additional
 pools
 of


costefficient
 capital.


Moving
 to
 our
 financial
 outlook,
 we


expect
 fourth
 quarter
 2025
 total
 revenue


to
 be
 in
 the
 range
 of
 56
 to
 59
 billion.


Our
 guidance
 assumes
 foreign
 currency
 is


an
 approximately
 1%
 tailwind
 to


year-over-year
 total
 revenue
 growth


based
 on
 current
 exchange
 rates.
 Our


outlook
 reflects
 an
 expectation
 for


continued
 strong
 ad
 revenue
 growth,


partially
 offset
 by
 lower
 year-over-year


Reality
 Labs
 revenue
 in
 Q4.
 The


anticipated
 reduction
 in
 Reality
 Labs


revenue
 is
 due
 to
 us
 lapping
 the


introduction
 of
 Quest
 3s
 in
 Q4
 of
 last


year,
 as
 well
 as
 retail
 partners


procuring
 Quest
 headsets
 during
 Q3
 of


this
 year
 to
 prepare
 for
 the
 holiday


season,
 which
 were
 recorded
 as
 revenue


in
 the
 third
 quarter.


Turning
 to
 the
 expense
 and
 capex


outlooks,
 I'll
 first
 start
 with
 2025


before
 providing
 some
 commentary
 on
 our


planning
 for
 2026.


We
 expect
 full
 year
 2025
 total
 expenses


to
 be
 in
 the
 range
 of
 116
 to
 $118


billion,
 updated
 from
 our
 prior
 outlook


of
 114
 to
 $118
 billion
 and
 reflecting
 a


growth
 rate
 of
 22
 to
 24%
 year-over-year.


We
 currently
 expect
 2025
 capital


expenditures,
 including
 principal


payments
 on
 finance
 leases,
 to
 be
 in
 the


range
 of
 70
 to
 72
 billion,
 increased


from
 our
 prior
 outlook
 of
 66
 to72


billion.


Onto
 tax,
 absent
 any
 changes
 to
 our
 tax


landscape,
 we
 expect
 our
 fourth
 quarter


2025
 tax
 rate
 to
 be
 12
 to
 15%.


Turning
 now
 to
 2026,


we
 are
 at
 an
 exciting
 point
 for
 our


company
 where
 we
 have
 continued
 runway


to
 improve
 our
 core
 services
 today
 as


well
 as
 the
 opportunity
 to
 build
 new
 AI


powered
 experiences
 and
 services
 that


will
 transform
 how
 people
 engage
 with


our
 products
 in
 the
 future.
 We
 expect


the
 set
 of
 investments
 we're
 making


within
 our
 ads
 and
 organic
 engagement


initiatives
 next
 year
 will
 enable
 us
 to


continue
 to
 deliver
 strong
 revenue


growth
 in
 2026.
 While
 our
 progress
 on
 AI


models
 and
 products
 will
 position
 us
 to


capitalize
 on
 new
 revenue
 opportunities


in
 the
 years
 to
 come.


A
 central
 requirement
 to
 realizing
 these


opportunities
 is
 infrastructure


capacity.
 As
 we
 have
 begun
 to
 plan
 for


next
 year,
 it's
 become
 clear
 that
 our


compute
 needs
 have
 continued
 to
 expand


meaningfully,
 including
 versus
 our
 own


expectations
 last
 quarter.
 We
 are
 still


working
 through
 our
 capacity
 plans
 for


next
 year,
 but
 we
 expect
 to
 invest


aggressively
 to
 meet
 these
 needs
 both
 by


building
 our
 own
 infrastructure
 and


contracting
 with
 thirdparty
 cloud


providers.
 We
 anticipate
 this
 will


provide
 further
 upward
 pressure
 on
 our


capex
 and
 expense
 plans
 next
 year.


As
 a
 result,
 our
 current
 expectation
 is


that
 capex
 dollar
 growth
 will
 be
 notably


larger
 in
 2026
 than
 2025.


We
 also
 anticipate
 total
 expenses
 will


grow
 at
 a
 significantly
 faster


percentage
 rate
 in
 2026
 than
 2025
 with


growth
 primarily
 driven
 by


infrastructure
 costs
 including


incremental
 cloud
 expenses
 and


depreciation.


Employee
 compensation
 costs
 will
 be
 the


second
 largest
 contributor
 to
 growth
 as


we
 recognize
 a
 full
 year
 of
 compensation


for
 employees
 hired
 throughout
 2025,


particularly
 AI
 talent,
 and
 add


technical
 talent
 in
 priority
 areas.


Finally,
 we
 continue
 to
 monitor
 active


legal
 and
 regulatory
 matters,
 including


the
 increasing
 headwinds
 in
 the
 EU
 and


the
 US
 that
 could
 significantly
 impact


our
 business
 and
 financial
 results.
 For


example,
 in
 the
 EU,
 we
 continue
 to


engage
 constructively
 with
 the
 European


Commission
 on
 our
 less
 personalized
 ads


offering.
 However,
 we
 cannot
 rule
 out


the
 commission
 imposing
 further
 changes


to
 that
 offering
 that
 could
 have
 a


significant
 negative
 impact
 on
 our


European
 revenue
 as
 early
 as
 this


quarter.
 In
 the
 US,
 a
 number
 of
 youth


related
 trials
 are
 scheduled
 for
 2026


and
 may
 ultimately
 result
 in
 a
 material


loss.


In
 closing,
 this
 was
 another
 good


quarter
 for
 our
 business.
 We
 have
 an


exciting
 set
 of
 opportunities
 to


continue
 improving
 our
 core
 business


while
 delivering
 innovative
 new


experiences
 and
 services
 for
 the
 people


and
 businesses
 using
 our
 products
 in
 the


years
 to
 come.
 With
 that,
 Christa,
 let's


open
 up
 the
 call
 for
 questions.


>> All
 right,
 Zucks.


>> Thank
 you.
 We
 will
 now
 open
 to
 720
 and


answer
 session.
 To
 ask
 a
 question,


please
 press
 star
 one
 on
 your
 touchstone


phone.
 To
 withdraw
 your
 question,
 again,


press
 star
 one.
 Please
 limit
 yourself
 to


one
 question.
 Please
 pick
 up
 your


handset
 before
 asking
 your
 question
 to


ensure
 clarity.
 If
 you
 are
 streaming


today's
 call,
 please
 mute
 your
 computer


speakers.
 And
 your
 first
 question
 comes


from
 the
 line
 of
 Brian
 Noak
 with
 Morgan


Stanley.
 Please
 go
 ahead.


>> Thanks
 for
 taking
 my
 questions.
 I
 have


uh
 two
 for
 for
 Susan.
 Uh
 the
 first
 one,


Susan.
 So
 the
 the
 the
 pipeline
 for
 for


core
 improvements
 to
 come
 in
 26
 with


models
 and
 ad
 ranking
 models
 and
 more


types
 of
 compute
 seems
 very
 exciting
 and


the
 the
 infrastructure
 build
 seems


sizable
 behind
 that.
 So
 can
 you
 help
 us


a
 little
 understand
 some
 of
 the
 early


quantifiable
 signals
 you're
 seeing
 on
 AB


tests
 from
 some
 of
 these
 improvements
 to


come
 that
 sort
 of
 make
 you
 most
 excited


and
 give
 you
 confidence
 you're
 going
 to


get
 ROIC
 from
 all
 this
 capex.
 That's
 the


first
 one.
 Second
 one's
 a
 little
 faster.


How
 how
 large
 is
 the
 reality
 labs


revenue
 headwind
 in
 the
 the
 4Q
 guidance?


Thanks.


>> Thanks,
 Brian,
 for
 the
 question.
 I
 think


your
 first
 question
 had
 a
 couple
 parts


to
 it.
 So,
 I'm
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 to


disagregate
 those
 parts
 and
 um
 let
 me


know
 if
 this
 if
 this
 addresses
 what


you're
 getting
 to.
 I
 will
 say
 that
 the


growth
 in
 2026
 capex
 uh
 relative
 to
 2025


comes
 from
 growth
 in
 each
 of
 the
 core


areas
 um
 MSL
 uh
 core
 AI
 as
 well
 as
 um


nonAI
 spend.
 So
 all
 of
 those
 areas
 are


growing
 but
 um
 the
 MSL
 AI
 needs
 are


growing
 the
 most


in
 terms
 of
 the
 core
 AI
 pipeline.
 You


know,
 I
 think
 we
 talked
 about
 uh
 last


year
 when
 we
 were
 going
 into
 the
 2025


budget
 process,
 we
 had
 a
 roadmap
 of


resource
 investments
 across
 both


headcount
 and
 compute
 that
 we
 um
 thought


would
 pay
 off,
 you
 know,
 in
 2026.
 And


it's
 really
 a
 very
 broad
 range
 of
 sort


of
 different
 ads
 um
 ranking
 and


performance
 uh
 efforts.
 Um
 and
 we're


continuing
 to
 see
 that,
 you
 know,
 those


have
 paid
 off
 through
 the
 course
 of
 the


year.


There
 is
 sort
 a
 long
 list
 of
 of
 spec
 of


specific
 efforts
 but
 one
 of
 the
 measures


that
 we
 look
 at
 to
 monitor
 this
 is
 is


you
 know
 how
 are
 we
 driving
 ad


performance?
 How
 are
 conversions


growing?
 Conversions
 is
 a
 complex
 metric


for
 us
 because
 advertisers
 optimize
 for


so
 many
 different
 um
 conversions


with
 different
 values.
 But
 when
 we


control
 for
 that
 and
 look
 at
 value


weighted
 conversion
 rates,
 we're
 seeing


very
 strong
 year-over-year
 growth
 and


conversions
 um
 weighted
 conversions


continue
 to
 grow
 faster
 um
 than
 than


impressions.
 We
 also
 talked
 about
 some


of
 the
 new
 model
 architecture
 um
 over


the
 course
 of
 the
 year
 and
 the
 degree
 to


which
 the
 new
 model
 architecture
 is


enabling
 us
 also
 to
 take
 advantage
 of


having
 more
 data
 and
 more
 compute
 to


drive
 ads
 performance.
 So
 we
 expect
 um


that
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 continued


story
 in
 2026.
 Uh
 we
 are
 in
 fact
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 our
 2026
 budgeting
 process


now
 and
 we
 you
 know
 see
 a
 similar
 list


of
 um
 of
 uh
 revenue
 investments


um
 that
 we
 you
 know
 that
 we're
 excited


to
 be
 able
 to
 invest
 in.
 And
 so
 we
 think


that
 um
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 part
 of


our
 ability
 to
 continue
 to
 drive
 strong


revenue
 performance
 throughout
 the
 year.


on
 your
 second
 question
 which
 is
 uh
 the


reality
 labs
 um
 the
 reality
 labs
 revenue


headwind
 um
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 have


quantified
 the
 exact
 size
 of
 that
 we


expect
 that
 Q4
 reality
 labs
 revenue
 will


be
 lower
 than
 last
 year
 for
 a
 couple


reasons
 that
 I
 alluded
 to
 the
 biggest


factor
 is
 we're
 lapping
 the
 introduction


of
 Quest
 3S
 and
 Q4
 of
 last
 year
 and
 we


don't
 have
 a
 new
 headset
 in
 the
 market


this
 year
 we
 also
 recorded
 all
 of
 our


holiday
 related
 Quest
 3S
 s
 sales
 in
 Q4


24
 since
 the
 headset
 was
 launched
 in


October
 24.
 This
 year,
 we're
 recognizing


some
 of
 those
 Quest
 3s
 sales
 in
 Q3
 as


retail
 partners
 have
 procured
 Quest


headsets
 in
 advance
 of
 um
 the
 holiday


season.
 We're
 still
 expecting


significant
 year-over-year
 growth
 in
 AI


glasses
 revenue
 in
 Q4
 as
 we
 benefit
 from


strong
 demand
 for
 the
 recent
 products


that
 we've
 introduced,
 but
 that
 is
 more


than
 offset
 by
 the
 headwinds
 um
 to
 the


Quest
 headsets.


Your
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the
 line


of
 Doug
 and
 Muth
 with
 JP
 Morgan.
 Please


go
 ahead.


Great.


>> Thanks
 for
 taking
 the
 question.
 Um,
 I


appreciate
 the
 strategy
 to
 frontload


capacity
 for
 super
 intelligence.
 Can
 you


just
 talk
 about
 your
 thought
 process
 in


kind
 of
 triangulating
 the
 capex
 dollar


growth
 and
 the
 significantly
 faster


expense
 growth
 next
 year
 with
 core


growth
 in
 the
 business
 and
 then
 the


impact
 on
 earnings
 and
 free
 cash
 flow


and
 do
 you
 do
 you
 have
 targets
 that
 we


should
 be
 thinking
 about
 for
 cash
 on


hand
 or
 net
 cash
 overall?
 Thanks.


>> Um,
 thanks
 Doug.


We're
 right
 now,
 I
 would
 say,
 in
 the


process
 of
 of
 we're
 relatively
 early


actually,
 still
 in
 the
 process
 of


putting
 together
 our
 budget
 for
 2026.


Um,
 and
 it
 is
 on
 the
 on
 the
 capacity


side
 a
 particularly,
 you
 know,
 dynamic


process.
 We're
 certainly
 seeing
 that
 we


wish
 we
 had
 more
 capacity
 today
 than
 we


do.
 We
 would
 be
 able
 to
 put
 it
 towards


good
 use.
 Um
 certain
 not
 only
 would
 the


MSL
 team
 appreciate
 having
 more
 capacity


but
 we'd
 be
 able
 to
 put
 it
 towards
 good


and
 ROI
 positive
 use
 in
 the
 core


business
 as
 well.
 Um
 so
 we're
 really


trying
 to
 plan
 ahead
 not
 only
 to
 ensure


that
 we
 have
 the
 capacity
 we
 need
 in


2026
 but
 also
 to
 give
 ourselves
 the
 sort


of
 flexibility
 and
 option
 value
 to
 have


the
 capacity
 that
 we
 think
 we
 could
 need


in
 27
 and
 28.


So
 that
 said,
 you
 know,
 there
 are
 lots


of
 moving
 pieces
 in
 the
 budget.
 It's
 not


baked
 yet.
 that
 it's
 still
 sort
 of
 in


the
 process
 of
 coming
 together.
 Um
 we


don't
 have
 you
 know
 specific
 targets
 to


share.
 Uh
 but
 we
 do
 feel
 like
 you
 know


our
 strategic
 priority
 is
 really
 making


sure
 that
 we
 have
 the
 compute
 that
 we


need
 to
 be
 well
 positioned
 to
 succeed
 at


AI.
 And
 you
 know
 that's
 that's
 sort
 of


the
 foremost
 priority
 as
 we're
 putting


together
 the
 budget.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 I
 I'll
 add
 a
 few
 thoughts


on
 this
 too.
 Although
 I
 I
 mean
 as
 Susan


said,
 we're
 we're
 still
 working
 through


the
 the
 actual
 budget
 and
 I
 think
 we'll


we'll
 typically
 have
 more
 to
 share
 on


that
 early
 next
 year.
 Uh
 but
 to
 date
 we


keep
 on
 seeing
 this
 pattern
 where
 we


build
 some
 amount
 of
 infrastructure
 to


what
 we
 think
 is
 an
 aggressive


assumption
 and
 then
 we
 keep
 on
 having


more
 demand
 to
 be
 able
 to
 use
 more


compute
 especially
 in
 the
 core
 business


in
 ways
 that
 we
 think
 would
 be
 quite


profitable
 uh
 than
 we
 end
 up
 having


compute
 for.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 that
 that


suggests
 that
 being
 able
 to
 make
 a


significantly
 larger
 investment
 here
 is


very
 likely
 to
 be
 a
 profitable
 thing


over
 um
 over
 some
 period
 because
 if
 the


primary
 use
 of
 it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 to


accelerate
 the
 the
 AI
 research
 and
 the


the
 new
 AI
 work
 that
 we're
 doing
 and
 how


that
 relates
 to
 both
 the
 core
 business


and
 new
 products.
 Um
 but
 any
 any
 compute


that
 we
 don't
 need
 for
 that,
 we
 feel


pretty
 good
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 absorb
 a
 very
 large
 amount
 of
 that
 to


just
 convert
 um
 into
 more
 intelligence


and
 better
 recommendations
 in
 our
 family


of
 apps
 and
 ads
 in
 a
 profitable
 way.
 Um


now
 I
 mean
 it's
 of
 course
 possible
 to


overshoot
 that
 right
 and
 if
 we
 do
 I
 mean


this
 is
 what
 I
 mentioned
 in
 my
 comments


then
 um
 you
 know
 we
 we
 see
 that
 there's


uh
 just
 a
 lot
 of
 demand
 for
 for
 other


new
 things
 that
 we would
 build


internally
 externally
 like
 almost
 every


week
 people
 come
 to
 us
 from
 outside
 the


company
 asking
 us
 to
 you
 know
 stand
 up


an
 API
 service
 or
 um
 asking
 if
 we
 have


different
 compute
 that
 they
 could
 get


from
 us
 and
 we
 haven't
 done
 that
 yet
 but


obviously
 if
 you
 got
 to
 a
 point
 where


you
 overbuilt
 you
 could
 you
 could
 have


that
 as
 an
 option.


Um
 and
 then
 you
 know
 the
 the
 kind
 of
 the


very
 worst
 case
 would
 be
 that
 we


effectively
 have
 just
 pre-built
 for
 a


couple
 of
 years
 in
 which
 case
 of
 course


there
 would
 be
 some
 loss
 and


depreciation
 but
 we'd
 grow
 into
 that
 and


use
 it
 over
 time.
 So
 my
 view
 on
 this
 is


that
 rather
 than
 continuing
 to
 be


constrained
 on
 capex
 and
 feeling
 in
 the


core
 business
 like
 we
 have
 significant


investments
 that
 we
 could
 make
 that


we're
 not
 able
 to
 make
 that
 would
 be


profitable.
 that
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do


is
 to
 try
 to
 accelerate
 this
 to
 make


sure
 that
 we
 have
 the
 compute
 that
 we


need
 both
 for
 the
 AI
 research
 and
 new


things
 that
 we're
 doing
 and
 to
 try
 to


get
 to
 a
 different
 state
 on
 our
 our


compute
 stance
 on
 the
 core
 business.
 So


that's
 kind
 of
 how
 I'm
 thinking
 about


that
 overall.
 Um,
 of
 course
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 operational
 constraints
 too
 on


what
 one
 can
 build,
 right?
 So,
 um,
 so


we're
 basically
 trying
 to
 work
 through


this
 all
 and
 and
 I
 think
 we'll
 have


more,
 uh,
 to
 share
 in
 in
 the
 coming


months
 and
 over
 the
 course
 of
 next
 year.


But,
 um,
 but
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 just
 a


huge
 huge
 amount
 of
 opportunities
 ahead


here.


>> Your
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the
 line


of
 Eric
 Sheridan
 with
 Goldman
 Sachs.


Please
 go
 ahead.


>> Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 taking
 the
 question,


Mark.
 wanted
 to
 reflect
 on
 some
 of
 your


comments
 with
 respect
 to
 scaling
 towards


super
 intelligence
 and
 bringing
 it
 back


to
 consumer
 AI.
 Maybe
 reflect
 a
 little


bit
 on
 the
 signals
 you've
 gotten
 on
 the


way
 consumers
 across
 family
 of
 apps


interact
 with
 meta
 AI
 today
 and
 how
 you


think
 about
 scaling
 and
 exiting
 models


from
 the
 super
 intelligence
 effort
 might


change
 the
 utility
 and
 behavior
 around


meta
 AI
 in
 the
 years
 ahead.
 Thanks.


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 use
 Meta
 AI


today.
 I
 mean
 as
 I
 said
 in
 my
 my


comments
 up
 front,
 there's
 more
 than
 a


billion
 people
 who
 use
 it
 on
 a
 monthly


basis.
 And
 what
 we
 see
 is
 that
 um
 as
 we


improve
 the
 quality
 of
 the
 model


primarily
 of
 for
 post-training
 llama
 4


at
 this
 point,
 we
 are
 um
 we
 continue
 to


see
 improvements
 in
 in
 usage.
 Um,
 so
 our


view
 is
 that
 when
 we
 get
 uh
 the
 new


models
 that
 we're
 building
 in
 MSL
 in


there
 and
 and
 get
 like
 truly
 frontier


models
 with
 novel
 capabilities
 that
 you


don't
 have
 in
 other
 places,
 then
 I
 think


that
 this
 is
 just
 a
 massive
 latent


opportunity,
 right?
 We
 we
 know
 I
 mean
 I


I
 would
 guess
 that
 you
 know
 Meta
 I
 think


has
 the
 best
 track
 record
 of
 any
 company


out
 there
 of
 taking
 a
 new
 product
 that


people
 love
 and
 getting
 it
 to
 billions


of
 people
 in
 terms
 of
 of
 usage.
 So
 I
 um


I
 I
 think
 that
 the
 ability
 to
 plug
 in
 um


leading
 models
 is
 going
 to
 I
 would


predict
 lead
 to
 a
 very
 large
 amount
 of


use
 of
 these
 things
 over
 the
 coming


years.
 So
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 very
 excited
 about


that.
 In
 terms
 of
 new
 new
 products,
 um


it's
 not
 just
 Meta
 AI
 as
 an
 assistant.
 I


think
 that
 there
 are
 going
 to
 be
 all


kinds
 of
 new
 products
 around
 um


different
 content
 formats
 and
 we're


starting
 to
 see
 that
 with
 with
 video
 and


content
 creation,
 but
 I
 think
 there's


going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 more
 like
 that
 that


that
 I'm
 quite
 excited
 about.
 Um
 and


then
 there
 are
 the
 business
 versions
 of


all
 these
 too
 like
 business
 AI
 and
 um


and
 then
 you
 know
 that's
 of
 course
 one


part
 of
 the
 story
 is
 the
 new
 things
 that


will
 be
 possible
 to
 build
 and
 then
 the


other
 part
 is
 how
 how
 more
 intelligent


models
 are
 just
 going
 to
 improve
 the


core
 business
 and
 improve
 the


recommendations
 that
 uh
 we
 make
 across


the
 family
 of
 apps
 and
 improve
 uh
 the


recommendations
 and
 advertising
 and
 I


think
 there's
 just
 a
 you
 know
 as
 we've


shown
 there's
 sort
 of
 this
 very
 large


amount
 of
 headroom
 and
 the
 opportunity


there
 keeps
 growing
 as
 we
 uh
 as
 as
 we


are
 improving
 and
 optimizing
 the
 AI


there
 and
 I
 think
 that
 that
 really
 shows


no
 sign
 of
 being
 near
 the
 end.
 I
 think


that
 there's
 quite
 a
 bit
 more
 to
 do


there
 and
 you
 know
 like
 I
 I
 I
 said
 um
 in


response
 to
 the
 last
 question
 we
 are


sort
 of
 perennially
 operating
 the
 family


of
 apps
 and
 ads
 business
 in
 a
 compute


starved
 state
 at
 this
 point.
 um
 which
 is


on
 the
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 sort
 of
 an
 odd


thing
 to
 say
 given
 the
 the
 compute
 that


we've
 built
 up,
 but
 we
 really
 are,
 you


know,
 taking
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 resources
 and


and
 using
 them
 to
 advance
 future
 things


that
 we're
 doing.
 And
 we
 think
 that


there's
 a
 lot
 more
 compute
 that
 we
 could


put
 towards
 these
 that
 that
 would
 um


just
 uh
 unlock
 a
 huge
 amount
 of


opportunity
 in
 the
 the
 the
 core
 business


as
 well.


>> Your
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the
 line


of
 Mark
 Schmoolik
 with
 Bernstein.
 Please


go
 ahead.


Uh
 yes,
 hi
 thanks
 for
 taking
 the


questions.
 Um
 Susan,
 as
 you
 think
 about


the
 visibility
 into
 kind
 of
 the
 runway


next
 year
 of
 continued
 ad
 performance


and
 engagement
 improvements,
 how
 do
 you


think
 about
 kind
 of
 the
 scale
 of
 those


improvements
 versus
 kind
 of
 the
 progress


we've
 seen
 over
 the
 last
 two
 years?
 Uh,


and
 then
 Mark,
 as
 you
 think
 about
 kind


of the
 timing
 of
 some
 of
 these
 newer


efforts
 coming
 out
 of
 Super
 Intelligence


Labs,
 is
 us
 anchoring
 to
 kind
 of
 an


updated
 frontier
 model
 launch
 sometime


next
 year
 like
 the
 right
 way
 for
 us
 to


think
 about
 it
 or
 should
 we
 be
 looking


at
 kind
 of
 progress
 from
 new
 products


you're
 excited
 to
 see
 shiplike
 vibes?


Thank
 you.


>> Um,
 thanks
 Mark.
 So
 on
 the
 sort
 of
 ads


improvement
 side
 um
 you
 know
 some
 of
 the


innovations
 that
 we
 have
 been
 uh


launching
 actually
 um
 you
 know
 involve


sort
 of
 improving
 our
 our
 larger
 scale


models.
 So
 we
 you
 know
 don't
 use
 our


larger
 model
 architectures
 like
 gem
 for


inference
 because
 their
 size
 and


complexity
 would
 make
 it
 too
 cost


prohibitive.
 Um
 the
 way
 that
 we
 drive


performance
 from
 those
 models
 is
 by


using
 them
 to
 transfer
 knowledge
 to


smaller
 lightweight
 models
 that
 are
 used


at
 runtime.
 And
 then
 in
 addition
 to
 the


foundation
 model
 work,
 we
 are
 working
 on


advancing
 our
 inference
 models
 by


developing
 new
 techniques
 and


architectures
 that
 then
 allow
 us
 to


scale
 up
 compute
 and
 complexity
 in
 an


ROI
 positive
 way.
 So
 um
 in
 general,
 you


know,
 we
 obviously
 have
 a
 very
 large


base
 of,
 you
 know,
 advertisers.
 There's


a
 lot
 of
 demand
 liquidity
 um
 in
 the


system
 and
 even
 you
 know
 smallcale


improvements
 that
 we
 are
 able
 to
 make
 in


terms
 of
 driving
 you
 know
 basis
 point


improvements
 in
 the
 performance
 of
 ads


or
 singledigit
 you
 know
 uh
 increases
 in


conversions
 relative
 to
 impressions
 in
 a


given
 quarter.
 You
 know
 off
 of
 a
 large


base
 mean
 that
 we're
 really
 able
 to


continue
 to
 grow
 the
 absolute
 dollars
 of


revenue
 growth
 in
 a
 in
 a
 pretty


meaningful
 way.


Your
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the
 line


of
 Justin
 Post
 with
 Bank
 of
 America.


Please
 go
 ahead.


>> Actually,


>> thank
 you.


>> Hey,
 Justin,
 just
 give
 us
 one
 second.
 I


think
 there
 was
 a
 second
 marks
 question


that
 we
 just
 want
 to
 get
 to
 on
 MSL.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I'll
 I'll
 keep
 it
 quick.
 I


mean,
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 have
 any
 specific


timing
 to
 to
 announce
 certainly
 on
 on
 um


the
 models
 or
 products,
 but
 I
 I
 expect


that
 you
 will
 see
 both.
 We
 we
 expect
 to


to
 build
 novel
 models
 and
 novel
 products


and
 I'm
 excited
 to
 share
 more
 when
 we


have
 it.


>> Kristen,
 please
 go
 ahead.


>> Great.
 Thanks.
 Um,
 so
 Mark,
 you


mentioned
 the
 prior
 two
 content
 cycles


and
 obviously
 you've
 been
 able
 to


generate
 very
 attractive
 margins
 on


them.
 as
 we
 get
 into
 the
 AI
 cycle,
 you


know,
 obviously
 some
 concerns
 on
 the


investment,
 but
 um
 can
 you
 talk
 a
 little


bit
 about
 how
 you're
 thinking
 about,
 you


know,
 tools
 that
 could
 be
 coming
 out
 for


users?
 You
 know,
 I
 know
 there's
 some
 new


competition.
 Um
 and
 then
 secondly,
 how


you
 think
 about
 margins
 in
 this
 content


cycle?
 Any
 reason
 to
 think
 they
 would
 be


different
 versus
 prior
 cycles?
 Thank


you.


Um,


I
 think
 it's
 too
 early
 to
 really


understand
 what
 the
 margins
 are
 going
 to


be
 for
 the
 for
 the
 new
 products
 that
 we


build.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 certainly
 every


each
 product
 has
 somewhat
 different


characteristics
 and
 I
 think
 we'll
 we'll


kind
 of
 understand
 how
 that
 goes
 over


time.
 Um,
 I
 mean,
 my
 general
 goal
 is
 to


build
 a
 business
 that
 maximizes
 value


for
 the
 people
 who
 use
 our
 products
 and


maximizes
 profitability,
 not
 margin.
 So,


I
 think
 we'll
 we'll
 kind
 of
 just
 try
 to


build
 the
 um
 the
 best
 things
 that
 that


we
 can
 and
 and
 um
 and
 try
 to
 deliver
 the


most
 value
 that
 we
 can
 for
 most
 people.


Your
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the
 line


of
 Ross
 Sandler
 with
 Barkclays.
 Please


go
 ahead.


>> Uh,
 great.
 Hey
 Mark,
 some
 of
 the
 goals


for
 uh
 competing
 AI
 labs
 are
 around


achieving
 AGI
 or
 these
 other
 milestones


that
 are
 kind
 of
 like
 out
 there
 and
 a


little
 esoteric.
 um
 how
 are
 you
 setting


up
 your
 new
 team
 in
 terms
 of
 achieving


those
 types
 of
 goals
 versus
 products


that
 can
 generate
 revenue
 from
 Meta
 kind


of
 right
 out
 of
 the
 gate?
 Um
 and
 and
 is


the
 goal
 that
 you
 had
 articulated
 to
 us


previously
 around
 giving
 you
 know


billions
 of
 people
 kind
 of
 a
 personal
 AI


to
 use
 uh
 the
 still
 the
 direction
 of


travel
 that
 you
 see
 or
 is
 there
 you
 know


other
 things
 like
 kind
 of
 this
 vibe
 or


sora
 uh
 angle
 that
 that
 you
 know
 you


think
 are
 are
 potentially
 important?
 How


should
 we
 think
 about
 like
 the
 overall


direction?
 Thank
 you.


>> Sure.
 So
 the
 way
 that
 I
 think
 about
 this


is
 that
 the
 research
 is
 going
 to
 enable


new
 technological
 capabilities
 to
 exist


and
 then
 those
 capabilities
 can
 get


built
 into
 all
 kinds
 of
 different


products.
 So
 the
 ability
 to
 reason
 more


intelligently
 is
 for
 example
 very


important
 across
 a
 large
 number
 of


things.
 It
 would
 be
 useful
 for
 an


assistant.
 Um
 it
 will
 also
 be
 useful
 in


business
 AI.
 It
 will
 also
 be
 useful
 in


the
 AI
 agent
 that
 we're
 building
 to
 help


advertisers
 figure
 out
 what
 their


campaigns
 are
 going
 to
 be.
 Um,
 it
 will


also
 have
 implications
 for
 eventually


how
 we
 do
 ranking
 and
 recommendations
 of


people's
 feeds
 and
 um
 and
 make
 different


decisions
 there.
 Um,
 that's
 just
 one


example.
 I
 mean
 certainly
 the
 capability


to
 be
 able
 to
 produce
 very
 high
 quality


good
 video
 is
 going
 to
 be
 useful
 for


giving
 people
 new
 creative
 tools.
 um
 it


will
 help
 increase
 the
 amount
 of
 content


inventory
 that
 can
 be
 shown
 in
 Instagram


and
 Facebook
 and
 therefore
 uh
 should


enable
 an
 increase
 in
 in
 engagement


there.
 It
 should
 help
 advertisers
 be


able
 to
 create
 creative
 that
 will
 help


us
 monetize
 better.
 So
 you
 can
 just
 go


kind
 of
 down
 the
 list
 of
 capabilities


that
 you'
 you'd
 expect
 and
 I
 think
 each


one
 will
 enable
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


things
 and
 I
 think
 the
 art
 of
 product


development
 here
 is
 looking
 at
 the
 list


of
 technology
 capabilities
 and
 figuring


out
 what
 new
 products
 are
 going
 to
 be


useful
 and
 uh
 prioritizing
 those.
 But


fundamentally
 I
 would
 sort
 of
 expect


this
 exponential
 curve
 in
 new
 technology


capabilities
 that
 are
 going
 to
 become


available.
 And
 the
 other
 thing
 that
 I


expect
 is
 that
 I
 think
 being
 the
 best
 in


a
 given
 area
 will
 drive
 great
 returns


rather
 than
 this
 is
 not
 like
 a
 check
 the


box
 exercise
 of
 like
 okay
 we
 can


generate
 some
 kind
 of
 content
 and


someone
 else
 can.
 I
 I
 think
 that
 like


the
 the
 company
 that
 is
 the
 best
 at
 each


of
 these
 capabilities
 I
 think
 will
 um


get
 a
 large
 amount
 of
 the
 the
 potential


value
 for
 for
 doing
 that.
 So
 there
 are


lots
 of
 different
 capabilities
 to
 to


build.
 Um
 I'm
 not
 sure
 that
 any
 one


company
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 best
 at
 all


of
 them.
 I
 doubt
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 the


case.
 But
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 we're
 trying
 to


do
 is
 not
 like
 not
 kind
 of
 do
 some


things
 that
 others
 have
 done.
 We're


really
 trying
 to
 build
 novel


capabilities.
 And
 I'm
 I'm
 keeping
 this


high
 level
 because
 I'm
 not
 I
 don't
 want


to
 necessarily
 from
 a
 competitive
 or


strategic
 perspective
 get
 into
 what


we're
 prioritizing.
 But
 um
 but
 that


hopefully
 gives
 you
 a
 sense
 of
 how
 we're


thinking
 about
 what
 we're
 doing.
 We
 want


to
 be
 able
 to
 to
 kind
 of
 build
 novel


things,
 build
 them
 into
 a
 lot
 of
 our


products
 and
 then
 have
 the
 compute
 to


scale
 them
 to
 billions
 of
 people.
 And
 we


think
 that
 that's
 going
 to
 both
 um
 show


up
 in
 terms
 of
 new
 products
 being


possible
 and
 new
 businesses
 and
 very


significant
 improvements
 to
 the
 current


business
 too.


>> Your
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the
 line


of
 Mark
 Mahani
 with
 Evercore
 ISI.
 Please


go
 ahead.


Uh
 uh
 thanks.
 Can
 I
 just
 ask
 just
 a


question
 on
 Meta
 AI
 and
 both
 the
 product


and
 the
 monetization
 path?
 So
 when
 you


look
 at
 it,
 what
 you've
 seen
 that's
 most


encouraging
 to
 you
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 uh


adoption
 and
 and
 uh
 the
 the
 the
 use
 of


uh
 of
 meta
 and
 then
 you
 know
 when
 you


think
 about
 um
 I
 know
 you
 you
 generally


like
 to
 roll
 out
 and
 then
 uh
 you
 know


deepen
 engagement
 and
 then
 later
 think


about
 modernization
 like
 where
 do
 you


think
 you
 are
 on
 that
 path
 now?
 Is
 it


clear
 to
 you
 what
 the
 modernization


options
 are
 for
 Meta
 AI?
 Thank
 you
 very


much.


>> Um,


I
 mean,
 I
 think
 the
 most
 promising
 thing


that
 we're
 seeing
 is
 one
 that
 we
 were


able
 to
 build
 something
 that
 a
 large


number
 of
 people
 use
 and
 I
 think
 that


that's
 valuable.
 And
 then
 secondly,
 that


as
 we
 there
 is
 a
 a
 clear
 correlation
 as


we
 improve
 the
 models
 in
 ways
 that
 we


think
 make
 them
 better
 that
 people
 use


them
 more.
 So
 that
 shows
 that
 we
 have
 um


a
 runway
 to
 basically
 be
 able
 to
 improve


engagement
 and
 turn
 this
 into
 um
 a


product
 that's
 leading
 over
 time.
 Um
 in


terms
 of
 where
 we
 are
 on
 this
 and
 we


basically
 just
 did
 this
 huge
 effort
 to


to
 um
 to
 boot
 up
 meta
 super
 intelligence


labs
 and
 build
 what
 I
 am
 very
 proud
 of


is
 I
 think
 the
 the
 highest
 talent


density
 lab
 in
 the
 industry
 at
 this


point.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 really
 great


researchers
 and
 infrastructure
 folks
 and


data
 folks
 who
 are
 who
 are
 now
 a
 part
 of


this
 effort
 who
 are
 um
 who
 are
 focused


on
 training
 the
 next
 generation
 of
 of


work
 and
 doing
 some
 some
 really
 novel


work.
 Um
 and
 when
 that
 is
 ready,
 I
 think


that
 we
 will
 be
 able
 to
 plug
 that
 into
 a


number
 of
 the
 products
 that
 we're


building
 and
 and
 I
 think
 that
 that
 will


be
 very
 exciting.
 But
 um
 I
 I I
 think


that
 that's
 really
 the
 next
 thing
 that


we're
 that
 we're
 looking
 at.
 And
 then


from
 there,
 I
 I
 think
 that
 these
 models


will
 also
 improve
 monetization
 in
 all


the
 different
 ways
 that
 uh
 that
 I
 that


we've
 talked
 about
 so
 far
 in
 terms
 of


improving
 engagement,
 improving
 um


advertising,
 helping
 advertisers
 engage.


I
 mean,
 there's
 the
 the
 one
 opportunity


that
 we
 just
 we
 usually
 talk
 about
 on


these
 calls,
 but
 hasn't
 hasn't
 come
 up


as
 much
 here
 is
 just
 the
 ability
 to
 make


it
 so
 that
 advertisers


um
 are
 increasingly
 just
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 give
 us
 a
 business
 objective
 and


give
 us
 a
 credit
 card
 or
 bank
 account


and
 like
 have
 the
 AI
 system
 basically


figure
 out
 everything
 else
 that's


necessary
 including
 generating
 video
 or


or
 or
 different
 types
 of
 creative
 that


might
 resonate
 with
 different
 people


that
 are
 personalized
 in
 different
 ways,


finding
 who
 the
 right
 customers
 are.
 All


of
 these
 um
 all
 of
 the
 capabilities
 that


we're
 building
 I
 think
 go
 towards


improving
 all
 of
 these
 different
 things.


So
 I'm
 quite
 optimistic
 about
 that.


Your
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the
 line


of
 Ronald
 Josie
 with
 City.
 Please
 go


ahead.


>> Great.
 Thanks
 for
 taking
 the
 question


and
 this
 maybe
 dubtails
 perfectly
 off
 of


Mark
 what
 you
 just
 talked
 about
 and
 you


know
 we
 heard
 a
 lot
 about
 end
 to
 end


automation
 here.
 I
 think
 reaching
 a
 $60


billion
 ARR.
 Want
 to
 hear
 about
 if
 you


can
 talk
 to
 us
 more
 just
 about
 adoption


rates
 amongst
 the
 advertisers
 and
 then


maybe
 bigger
 picture
 as
 you
 incorporate


ranking
 recommendation
 changes
 like


Andromeda
 or
 gems
 or
 lattice
 just
 talk


to
 us
 how
 this
 automation
 is
 driving


call
 it
 a
 higher
 ROI
 for
 for
 advertisers


overall
 as
 we
 bring
 it
 all
 together.


Thank
 you.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 we've
 been
 we've
 been
 sort
 of


laying
 the
 the
 continued
 uh
 brick
 by


brick
 build
 of
 um
 of
 Advantage
 Plus
 and


extending
 the
 set
 of
 objectives
 that
 it


applies
 to
 over
 time.
 And
 so,
 in
 Q3,
 we


completed
 the
 global
 roll
 out
 of
 the


streamlined
 campaign
 creation
 flow
 for


Advantage
 Plus
 lead
 campaigns.
 So
 now


advertisers
 who
 are
 running
 sales
 app
 or


lead
 campaigns
 have
 endto-end
 automation


turned
 on
 from
 the
 beginning.
 Um
 and


like
 you
 know
 the
 kind
 of
 application
 of


the
 streamlined
 campaign
 creation
 flow


for
 other
 objectives.
 This
 generally


allows
 advertisers
 to
 optimize
 um
 and


automate
 several
 aspects
 of
 the
 campaign


setup
 process
 at
 once.
 That
 includes


things
 like
 audience
 selection,
 where
 to


show
 the
 ad,
 how
 the
 budget
 gets
 paced


and
 distributed
 across
 adsets
 to
 to


drive
 the
 most
 efficient
 outcomes.
 Um,


and
 you
 know,
 we
 see
 that
 Advantage
 Plus


continues
 to
 drive
 performance
 gains.


Advertisers
 who
 run
 lead
 campaigns
 using


Advantage
 Plus
 uh
 are
 seeing
 a
 14%
 lower


cost
 per
 lead
 um
 on
 average
 than
 those


than
 those
 who
 are
 not.
 And
 I
 would
 say


that
 we
 think
 that
 there
 is
 still
 a
 lot


of
 opportunity
 generally
 to
 grow


adoption
 of
 Advantage
 Plus.
 Um,
 a
 lot
 of


advertisers
 only
 use
 our
 end-to-end


automated
 solutions
 for
 a
 portion
 of


their
 campaigns.
 So,
 we
 can
 grow
 share


there.
 Uh
 and
 to
 capture
 that


opportunity,
 we're
 focused
 on
 driving


continued
 performance
 improvements
 and


addressing
 some
 of
 the
 key
 use
 cases


that
 we
 still
 need
 in
 order
 to
 grow


adoption.
 Um
 we're
 also
 working
 to


broaden
 adoption
 among
 advertisers
 who


use
 one
 of
 our
 singlestep
 automated


solutions.
 For
 example,
 advertisers
 who


might
 only
 use
 a
 piece
 of
 it
 like


advantage
 plus
 audiences
 by
 helping
 them


understand
 um
 the
 benefits
 of
 using
 more


than
 one
 automated
 s
 one
 automated


solution
 um
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 So
 I
 would


say
 uh
 advantage
 plus
 is
 sort
 of
 an


ongoing
 platform
 by
 which
 we
 both


continue
 to
 expand
 the
 feature
 set
 that


is
 available
 in
 advantage
 plus
 and
 then


expand
 the
 extensibility
 or
 the
 coverage


of
 that
 feature
 set
 to
 sort
 of
 the


broader
 set
 of
 advertisers.
 Um
 you
 know


I
 think
 Mark
 uh
 mentioned
 that


the
 annual
 revenue
 run
 right
 now
 for


advertisers
 who
 are
 using
 these


automated
 options
 is
 you
 know
 $60


billion.
 And
 again,
 we
 we
 see
 that


there's
 room
 to
 continue
 growing
 that.


>> Your
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the
 line


of
 Yousef
 Wallally
 with
 Truist


Securities.
 Please
 go
 ahead.


>> Great.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much,
 Mark.
 On
 on


wearables
 in
 particular,
 do
 you
 think


you'll
 be
 able
 to
 sell
 enough
 hardware


to
 recoup
 your
 investment
 or
 is
 that


dependent
 on
 maybe
 creating
 new
 avenues


for
 revenue
 from
 things
 like
 advertising


services
 and
 commerce
 through
 that
 new


computing
 platform?
 and
 and
 if
 so,
 what


are
 kind
 of
 the
 gating
 factors
 there?


And
 then
 Susan,
 um,
 how
 do
 you
 see
 the


onbalance
 sheet
 versus
 offbalance
 sheet


financing
 on
 of
 your
 AI
 initiatives?


You've
 recently
 struck
 a
 deal
 the
 blue


owl
 for
 the
 Louisiana
 data
 center.
 Is


that
 part
 of
 the
 capex
 guide
 for
 26?
 And


if
 it's
 not,
 how
 significant
 will
 that


way
 of
 funding
 be
 for
 meta
 going


forward?
 And
 basically,
 would
 that
 slow


down
 your
 capex
 growth
 past
 2026?
 Thank


you.


I
 can
 talk
 about
 wearables
 and
 then
 and


Susan
 can
 jump
 in
 on
 the
 other
 part.
 So


I
 think
 that
 there
 are
 a
 few
 pieces


here.
 Um
 one
 is
 that
 the
 the
 work
 that


on
 Rayban
 Meta
 and
 the
 Oakley
 Meta
 uh


products
 is
 going
 very
 well.
 Um
 I
 I


think
 yeah
 I
 mean
 at
 some
 point
 if
 if


these
 continue
 going
 as
 well
 as
 it
 as
 it


has
 been
 then
 um
 then
 I
 think
 it
 will
 be


a
 very
 profitable
 investment.
 I
 think


that
 there's
 there's
 some
 um
 revenue


that
 we
 get
 from
 from
 basically
 selling


the
 devices
 and
 then
 some
 that
 will
 come


from
 additional
 services
 and
 from
 the
 AI


on
 top
 of
 it.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 a


big
 opportunity.
 Um
 certainly
 the


investment
 here
 is
 not
 just
 to
 to
 kind


of
 build
 a
 um
 just
 the
 the
 device,
 it's


also
 to
 build
 these
 services
 on
 top.
 Um,


right
 now
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 get
 the


devices
 uh
 for
 a
 range
 of
 things
 that


don't
 even
 include
 the
 AI
 even
 though


they
 like
 the
 AI,
 but
 I
 think
 over
 time


the
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 become
 the
 main
 thing


that
 people
 are
 using
 them
 for.
 And
 I


think
 that
 that's
 going
 to
 end
 up
 having


a
 big
 business
 opportunity
 by
 itself.
 Um


but
 you
 know
 as
 as
 um
 products
 like
 the


Rayban
 Meta
 and
 Oakley
 Metas
 are
 are


growing
 um
 we're
 also
 going
 to
 keep
 on


investing
 in
 things
 like
 the
 more
 full


field
 of
 view
 um
 product
 form
 of
 um
 of


the
 Orion
 prototype
 that
 we
 showed
 at


Connect
 last
 year.
 So
 those
 things
 are


obviously
 earlier
 in
 their
 curve
 towards


getting
 to
 being
 a
 sustaining
 business.


And
 our
 general
 view
 is
 that
 we
 want
 to


build
 these
 out
 to
 reach
 many
 hundreds


of
 millions
 or
 billions
 of
 people.
 And


that's
 the
 the
 the
 point
 at
 which
 we
 we


think
 that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 um
 just


an
 extremely
 profitable
 business.


>> Um
 Yousef
 your
 second
 uh
 question.
 So


the
 uh
 JV
 that
 we
 announced
 with
 Blue


Owl
 um
 is
 is
 sort
 of
 an
 example
 of
 you


finding
 a
 solution
 that
 enabled
 us
 to


partner
 with
 external
 capital
 providers


to
 co-develop
 data
 centers
 in
 a
 way
 that


gives
 us
 long-term
 optionality
 in


supporting
 our
 future
 capacity
 needs


just
 given
 both
 you
 know
 the
 magnitude


but
 also
 uncertainty
 of
 what
 the
 um
 the


capacity
 outlook
 in
 future
 years
 looks


like.
 Um,
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 that
 is


recognized
 as
 capex,
 our
 prior
 capbacks


reflected
 a
 portion
 of
 the
 data
 center


build
 cost
 prior
 to
 the
 joint
 venture


being
 established.
 Going
 forward,
 the


construction
 costs
 of
 the
 data
 center
 uh


will
 not
 be
 reported
 recorded
 in
 capex


as
 the
 data
 center
 is
 constructed.
 We


will
 contribute
 20%
 of
 the
 remaining


construction
 costs
 required
 um
 which
 is


in
 line
 with
 our
 ownership
 stake
 and


those
 will
 be
 recorded
 as
 other


investing
 cash
 flows.


All
 right,
 I'm
 switching
 to
 Google.
 Uh,


we
 got
 like
 30
 seconds.
 Jose,
 any
 quick


thoughts
 on
 what
 you
 heard
 just
 now?


>> Um,
 I
 think
 you
 posted
 it
 on
 next
 that


they
 mentioned
 they
 feel
 like
 they


always
 have
 enough
 compute,
 but
 it's


never
 enough.
 Um,
 and
 for
 that
 reason,


and
 the
 other
 thing
 is
 they're
 really


focused
 with
 AI.
 They're
 not
 focused
 on


creating
 AGI,
 right?
 They're
 focused
 on


making
 AI
 solutions
 that
 are
 going
 to


directly
 impact
 their
 core
 revenue.
 So,


I'd
 like
 to
 hear
 from
 that.
 It's
 a
 whole


different
 approach
 from
 some
 of
 the


other
 AI
 labs
 out
 there.


Sam,
 any
 quick
 thoughts?


>> I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 questions
 really


were
 around
 reality
 labs,
 uh,
 as
 far
 as


the
 guy
 down
 and
 how
 much
 capex
 they're


spending
 and
 basically
 kind
 of
 reason


with
 the
 analysts
 as
 far
 as
 like
 why
 we


spending
 so
 much
 money.
 I
 did


did
 kind
 of
 notice
 for
 a
 minute
 that
 he


I
 think
 he
 was
 like
 Mark
 was
 trying
 to


say
 it
 from
 a
 defensive
 standpoint
 as
 to


why
 we're
 spending
 this
 much
 money,
 not


like
 an
 exciting
 standpoint.
 But
 it's


like
 look,
 we're
 spending
 this
 money


because
 we're
 really
 excited
 for
 the


future.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 criticism
 has


actually
 translated
 into
 the
 price
 that


you
 see
 after
 hours,
 how
 it's
 selling


off.
 Maybe
 they're
 not
 seeing
 it
 happen


as
 much
 as
 fast
 as
 they
 expect.
 I
 mean,


with
 this,
 you
 know,
 like
 it
 really
 is
 a


bet
 at
 this
 point.
 I
 think
 Meta's
 margin


expansion
 story
 was
 already
 baked
 into


the
 price
 and
 now
 it's
 like,
 well,
 we


want
 more
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 keep
 your


stock
 price
 up
 here.
 So,
 uh,
 we
 we
 we'll


see
 what
 Google
 says.
 I
 mean,
 as
 far
 as


everything
 else
 goes,
 man,
 they're
 all


spending
 more
 money,
 so
 it's
 always
 a


good
 thing
 to
 see.
 It's
 what
 I
 want
 to


see
 right
 now.


>> Yep.
 No,
 I
 would
 agree.
 I
 think
 overall


it
 looks
 like
 things
 are
 going
 in
 the


right
 direction.
 It's
 just
 that
 onetime


tax
 fee
 is
 uh
 what's
 getting
 the
 street


upset.
 By
 the
 way,
 guys,
 Sam's
 and


Jose's
 Twitter
 putting
 that
 in
 the
 chat


and
 their
 YouTube,
 so
 you
 can
 follow


them
 there.
 And
 let's
 get
 into
 the


googs.


>> I'll
 quickly
 cover
 the
 safe
 harbor.
 Some


of
 the
 statements
 that
 we
 make
 today


regarding
 our
 business
 operations
 and


financial
 performance
 may
 be
 considered


forward-looking.
 Such
 statements
 are


based
 on
 current
 expectations
 and


assumptions
 that
 are
 subject
 to
 a
 number


of
 risks
 and
 uncertainties.
 Actual


results
 could
 differ
 materially.
 Please


refer
 to
 our
 forums
 10K
 and
 10Q


including
 the
 risk
 factors.
 We
 undertake


no
 obligation
 to
 update
 any


forward-looking
 statement.
 During
 this


call,
 we
 will
 present
 both
 GAAP
 and


non-GAAP
 financial
 measures.
 A


reconciliation
 of
 non-GAAPT
 GAP
 measures


is
 included
 in
 today's
 earnings
 press


release
 which
 is
 distributed
 and


available
 to
 the
 public
 through
 our


investor
 relations
 website
 located
 at


abc.xyz/investor.


Our
 comments
 will
 be
 on
 year-over-year


comparisons
 unless
 we
 state
 otherwise.


And
 now
 I'll
 turn
 the
 call
 over
 to


Sundar.


Thank
 you
 Jim.
 Good
 afternoon
 everyone


and
 thanks
 for
 joining
 us.
 This
 was
 a


terrific
 quarter
 for
 Alphabet
 driven
 by


double-digit
 growth
 across
 every
 major


part
 of
 our
 business.
 We
 are
 seeing
 AI


now
 driving
 real
 business
 results
 across


the
 company.


We
 delivered
 our
 first
 ever
 $100
 billion


quarter.
 5
 years
 ago,
 our
 quarterly


revenue
 was
 at
 50
 billion.
 Our
 revenue


number
 has
 doubled
 since
 then,
 and
 we


are
 firmly
 in
 the
 generative
 AI
 era.
 In


parallel,
 we've
 built
 for
 the
 long
 term


and
 diversified
 with
 successful


businesses
 in
 cloud,
 YouTube,
 and


subscriptions.


Our
 momentum
 is
 strong
 and
 we
 are


shipping
 at
 speed.
 As
 just
 a
 few


examples,
 a
 first
 party
 models
 like


Gemini
 now
 process
 7
 billion
 tokens
 per


minute
 via
 direct
 API
 use
 by
 our


customers.


The
 Gemini
 app
 now
 has
 over
 650
 million


monthly
 active
 users
 and
 queries


increased
 by
 3x
 from
 Q2.


Cloud
 had
 another
 great
 quarter
 of


accelerating
 growth
 with
 AI
 revenue
 as
 a


key
 driver.
 Cloud
 backlog
 grew
 46%


quarterover-arter
 to
 155
 billion.


And
 we
 crossed
 300
 million
 paid


subscriptions
 led
 by
 growth
 in
 Google


One
 and
 YouTube
 Premium.


Today
 I'll
 discuss
 progress
 in
 our
 full


stack
 approach
 to
 AI
 and
 then
 share


highlights
 from
 search
 cloud
 YouTube
 and


Whimo.
 As
 a
 reminder,
 our
 full
 stack


approach
 spans
 AI
 infrastructure,


worldclass
 research,
 including
 models


and
 tooling
 and
 our
 products
 and


platforms
 that
 bring
 AI
 to
 people


everywhere.


First
 up,
 AI
 infrastructure.


Our
 extensive
 and
 reliable


infrastructure
 which
 powers
 all
 of


Google's
 products
 is
 the
 foundation
 of


our
 stack
 and
 a
 key
 differentiator.


We
 are
 scaling
 the
 most
 advanced
 chips


in
 our
 data
 centers
 including
 GPUs
 from


our
 partner
 Nvidia
 as
 well
 as
 our
 own


purpose-built
 TPUs
 and
 we
 are
 the
 only


company
 providing
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 both.


As
 we
 announced
 yesterday
 at
 Nvidia
 GTC,


we
 are
 now
 shipping
 the
 new
 A4X
 Max


instances
 powered
 by
 Nvidia
 GB300
 to
 our


cloud
 customers.


Our
 highly
 sought-after
 TPU
 portfolio
 is


led
 by
 our
 seventh
 generation
 TPU


Ironwood,
 which
 will
 be
 generally


available
 soon.
 We
 are
 investing
 in
 TPU


capacity
 to
 meet
 the
 tremendous
 demand


we
 are
 seeing
 from
 customers
 and


partners.
 And
 we
 are
 excited
 that


Anthropic
 recently
 shared
 plans
 to


access
 up
 to
 1
 million
 TPUs.


Next,
 worldclass
 AI
 research
 including


models
 and
 tooling.
 Our
 models
 are


worldleading.
 Gemini
 2.5
 Pro,
 VO
 Genie3,


and
 our
 viral
 sensation
 nano
 banana
 are


among
 the
 very
 best
 in
 class.
 Over
 230


million
 videos
 have
 been
 generated
 with


V3
 and
 more
 than
 13
 million
 developers


have
 built
 with
 our
 generative
 models.


We're
 looking
 forward
 to
 the
 release
 of


Gemini
 3
 later
 this
 year.
 Our
 research


leadership
 is
 advancing
 Next
 Frontier


Technologies.
 Last
 week,
 we
 announced


that
 our
 Willow
 Quantum
 chip
 achieved
 a


major
 breakthrough,
 running
 an
 algorithm


13,000
 times
 faster
 than
 one
 of
 the


world's
 best
 supercomputers.


And
 the
 result
 is
 verifiable,
 paving
 the


way
 to
 future
 practical
 applications.


Speaking
 of
 quantum,
 let
 me
 congratulate


Michel
 Devy,
 our
 chief
 scientist
 for


quantum
 hardware.
 He
 received
 a
 Nobel
 in


physics
 for
 early
 research
 he
 did
 in
 the


1980s.
 Three
 nobles
 awarded
 to
 current


Googlers
 in
 two
 years.
 Incredible.
 And


third,
 our
 products
 and
 platforms.
 We


are
 bringing
 AI
 to
 more
 people
 and


developers
 than
 anyone
 else.
 In
 July,
 we


announced
 that
 we
 processed
 980
 trillion


monthly
 tokens
 across
 all
 our
 surfaces.


We
 are
 now
 processing
 over
 1.3


quadrillion
 monthly
 tokens,
 more
 than


20x
 growth
 in
 a
 year.
 Phenomenal.
 This


quarter,
 we
 took
 big
 steps
 to
 reimagine


Chrome
 as
 a
 browser
 powered
 by
 AI


through
 deep
 integrations
 with
 Gemini


and
 AI
 mode
 in
 search
 with
 more
 agentic


capabilities
 coming
 soon.
 In
 August
 at


made
 by
 Google,
 we
 unveiled
 our
 Pixel
 10


series
 of
 devices.
 They
 are
 the
 first


with
 our
 most
 powerful
 chip
 designed
 to


run
 on
 Gemini
 Tensor
 G5.
 They're
 our


best
 reviewed
 devices
 ever.
 And
 last


week,
 we
 launched
 Android
 XR,
 our
 new


operating
 system
 with
 Samsung's
 Galaxy


XR
 device.
 It
 brings
 new
 ways
 to
 use


headsets
 and
 glasses
 with
 Gemini
 at
 the


core.


Now,
 turning
 to
 highlights
 from
 search.


AI
 is
 driving
 an
 expansionary
 moment
 for


search.
 As
 people
 learn
 what
 they
 can
 do


with
 our
 new
 AI
 experiences,
 they're


increasingly
 coming
 back
 to
 search
 more.


Search
 and
 its
 AI
 experiences
 are
 built


to
 highlight
 the
 web,
 sending
 billions


of
 clicks
 to
 sites
 every
 day.
 During
 the


Q2
 call,
 we
 shared
 that
 overall
 queries


and
 commercial
 queries
 continue
 to
 grow


year-over-year.


This
 growth
 rate
 increased
 in
 Q3,


largely
 driven
 by
 our
 AI
 investments
 in


search.
 most
 notably
 AI
 overviews
 and
 AI


mode.
 Let
 me
 dive
 into
 the
 momentum
 we


are
 seeing.
 As
 we
 have
 shared
 before,
 AI


overviews
 drive
 meaningful
 query
 growth.


This
 effect
 was
 even
 stronger
 in
 Q3
 as


users
 continue
 to
 learn
 that
 Google
 can


answer
 more
 of
 their
 questions
 and
 it's


particularly
 encouraging
 to
 see
 the


effect
 was
 more
 pronounced
 with
 younger


people.


We're
 also
 seeing
 that
 AI
 mode
 is


resonating
 well
 with
 users
 in
 the
 US.
 We


have
 seen
 strong
 and
 consistent


week-overweek
 growth
 in
 usage
 since


launch
 and
 queries
 doubled
 over
 the


quarter.
 Over
 the
 last
 quarter,
 we


rolled
 out
 AI
 mode
 globally
 across
 40


languages
 in
 record
 time.
 It
 now
 has


over
 75
 million
 daily
 active
 users
 and


we
 shipped
 over
 100
 improvements
 to
 the


product
 in
 Q3
 and
 incredibly
 fast
 pace.


Most
 importantly,
 AI
 mode
 is
 already


driving
 incremental
 total
 query
 growth


for
 search.
 Philip
 will
 talk
 more
 about


monetization
 and
 share
 how
 AI
 is
 helping


people
 connect
 with
 businesses
 and
 shop


on
 search.


Next,
 Google
 Cloud.
 Our
 complete


enterprise
 AI
 product
 portfolio
 is


accelerating
 growth
 in
 revenue,


operating
 margins,
 and
 backlog.
 In
 Q3,


customer
 demand
 strengthened
 in
 three


ways.
 One,
 we
 are
 signing
 new
 customers


faster.
 The
 number
 of
 new
 GCP
 customers


increased
 by
 nearly
 34%
 year-over-year.


Two,
 we
 are
 signing
 larger
 deals.
 We


have
 signed
 more
 deals
 over
 $1
 billion


through
 Q3
 this
 year
 than
 we
 did
 in
 the


previous
 two
 years
 combined.
 Third,
 we


are
 deepening
 our
 relationships.
 Over


70%
 of
 existing
 Google
 Cloud
 customers


use
 our
 AI
 products,
 including
 Bank
 OBV,


Best
 Buy,
 and
 Fairpric.


As
 we
 scale,
 we
 are
 diversifying


revenue.
 Today,
 13
 product
 lines
 are


each
 at
 an
 annual
 run
 rate
 over
 $1


billion.


And
 we
 are
 improving
 operating
 margin


with
 highly
 differentiated
 products


built
 with
 our
 own
 technology.


This
 deep
 product
 differentiation
 starts


with
 our
 AI
 infrastructure.
 We
 have
 a


decade
 of
 experience
 building
 AI


accelerators
 and
 today
 offer
 the
 widest


array
 of
 chips.
 This
 leadership
 is


winning
 customers
 like
 HCA
 Healthcare,


LGAI
 Research
 and
 McQuary
 Bank.
 And
 it's


why
 nine
 of
 the
 top
 10
 AI
 labs
 choose


Google
 Cloud.
 We
 are
 also
 the
 only
 cloud


provider
 offering
 our
 own
 leading


generative
 AI
 models
 including
 Gemini,


Imagine,
 Vio,
 Chirp,
 and
 Lyria.
 Adoption


is
 rapidly
 accelerating.
 In
 Q3,
 revenue


from
 products
 built
 on
 our
 generative
 AI


models
 grew
 more
 than
 200%


year-over-year.


Over
 the
 past
 12
 months,
 nearly
 150


Google
 Cloud
 customers
 each
 processed


approximately
 1
 trillion
 tokens
 with
 our


models
 for
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 applications.


For
 example,
 WPP
 is
 creating
 campaigns


with
 up
 to
 70%
 efficiency
 gains.


Sarowski
 has
 increased
 email
 open
 rates


by
 17%
 and
 accelerated
 campaign


localization
 by
 10
 times.


Earlier
 this
 month,
 we
 launched
 Gemini


Enterprise,
 the
 new
 front
 door
 for
 AI
 in


the
 workplace
 and
 we
 are
 seeing
 strong


adoption
 for
 agents
 built
 on
 this


platform.
 Our
 packaged
 enterprise
 agents


in
 Gemini
 Enterprise
 are
 optimized
 for
 a


variety
 of
 domains,
 are
 highly


differentiated,
 and
 offer
 significant


out-of-box
 value
 to
 customers.
 We
 have


already
 crossed
 2
 million
 subscribers


across
 700
 companies.


Next,
 YouTube.
 In
 the
 living
 room,


YouTube
 has
 remained
 number
 one
 in


streaming
 watchtime
 in
 the
 US
 for
 more


than
 two
 years,
 according
 to
 Neielson.


Last
 month
 marked
 YouTube's
 first
 time


as
 a
 live
 NFL
 broadcaster.
 This


exclusive
 global
 broadcast
 live
 from


Brazil
 drew
 more
 than
 19
 million
 fans


and
 set
 a
 new
 record
 for
 most
 concurrent


viewers
 of
 a
 live
 stream
 on
 YouTube.


YouTube
 shots
 also
 continues
 to
 perform


well
 in
 the
 US.
 Shots
 now
 earn
 more


revenue
 per
 watch
 than
 traditional


instream
 on
 YouTube.
 At
 our
 made
 on


YouTube
 event,
 we
 rolled
 out
 a
 number
 of


AI
 powered
 features
 that
 are
 helping


creators
 supercharge
 creation
 and
 build


their
 businesses.
 AI
 is
 now
 streamlining


the
 entire
 content
 creation
 workflow


from
 generative
 video
 tools
 and
 more


efficient
 editing
 to
 AI
 powered
 insights


that
 help
 creators
 optimize
 their


channels.
 We
 are
 also
 using
 AI
 to
 expand


monetization,
 automatically
 identifying


products
 to
 make
 their
 videos
 more


shoppable.
 Philip
 will
 discuss
 in
 more


detail.
 And
 finally,
 Whimo.
 Next
 year,


VHO
 aims
 to
 open
 service
 in
 London
 and


they
 are
 working
 to
 bring
 service
 to


Tokyo.
 They've
 also
 announced
 expansions


to
 Dallas,
 Nashville,
 Denver,
 and


Seattle
 and
 secured
 permission
 to


operate
 fully
 autonomously
 at
 San
 Jose


and
 San
 Francisco
 airports.
 Autonomous


testing
 continues
 to
 scale
 in
 New
 York


City.
 The
 new
 VHO
 for
 business
 allows


enterprises
 to
 offer
 Whimo
 as
 a
 work


travel
 option.


and
 we
 launched
 Wayo
 teens
 accounts
 in


Phoenix
 this
 summer.
 We
 are
 pleased
 to


see
 usage
 steadily
 increase
 with


positive
 feedback
 from
 teens
 and
 their


parents
 alike.
 Whimo's
 growth
 and


momentum
 are
 strong
 and
 2026
 is
 shaping


up
 to
 be
 an
 exciting
 year.


Overall,
 a
 milestone
 quarter.
 The


incredible
 work
 of
 our
 teams
 is
 driving


momentum
 across
 the
 board
 and
 our


leadership
 in
 AI
 positions
 us
 so
 well


for
 the
 opportunity
 ahead.
 I
 want
 to


thank
 all
 of
 our
 partners
 and
 our


employees
 for
 their
 hard
 work
 and
 an


excellent
 Q3.
 With
 that,
 I'll
 turn
 it


over
 to
 Philip.


>> Thanks,
 Andor.


>> All
 right,
 this
 part's
 going
 to
 be


boring,
 but
 10
 minutes
 of
 this
 and
 then


Q&A


>> for
 the
 quarter,
 then
 structure
 the
 rest


of
 my
 remarks
 around
 the
 great
 progress


we're
 delivering
 across
 search,
 ads,


YouTube,
 and
 partnerships.
 Google


services
 revenues
 were
 87
 billion
 for


the
 quarter
 up
 14%
 yearonear
 driven
 by


accelerated
 growth
 in
 search
 and
 YouTube


partially
 offset
 by
 year-on-year
 decline


in
 network
 revenues
 adding
 some
 further


color
 to
 our
 results
 the
 15%
 increase
 in


search
 and
 other
 was
 led
 by
 growth


across
 all
 major
 verticals
 with
 the


largest
 contributions
 from
 retail
 and


financial
 services
 YouTube
 saw
 similar


performance
 across
 verticals
 its
 15%


growth
 in
 advertising
 revenues
 was


driven
 by
 direct
 response
 followed
 by


brand.
 Starting
 with
 search
 and
 other


revenues,
 which
 delivered
 over
 56


billion
 in
 revenue
 for
 the
 quarter,
 as
 S


mentioned,
 AI
 is
 driving
 an
 expansionary


moment
 and
 transforming
 how
 people
 use


Google
 search.
 Our
 investments
 in
 new
 AI


experiences
 such
 as
 AI
 overviews
 and
 AI


mode
 continue
 to
 drive
 growth
 in
 overall


queries,
 including
 commercial
 queries,


creating
 more
 opportunities
 for


monetization.


These
 AI
 experiences
 are
 enhancing
 how


people
 connect
 with
 businesses
 and
 shop


on
 search.
 We
 recently
 added
 shopping


capabilities
 in
 AI
 mode
 which
 now
 help


people
 shop
 conversationally
 in
 search


and
 we
 expanded
 tryon
 capabilities
 to


more
 clothing
 items
 now
 available
 to


anyone
 in
 the
 US.
 Lastly,
 we're
 making


it
 easier
 for
 consumers
 to
 benefit
 from


deals
 through
 new
 loyalty
 offerings
 like


personalized
 annotations
 on
 organic


results
 and
 ads.
 Looking
 at


monetization,
 businesses
 can
 now
 tap


into
 our
 most
 powerful
 AI
 search


experiences.
 Using
 our
 most
 advanced
 AI


models,
 we
 can
 understand
 and
 predict


intent
 like
 never
 before,
 unlocking


entirely
 new
 commercial
 pathways
 to


provide
 valuable
 new
 consumer


connections
 and
 helping
 us
 monetize
 even


more
 efficiently.
 Rolled
 out
 globally
 in


September,
 AMAX
 and
 Search
 is
 already


used
 by
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of


advertisers,
 currently
 making
 it
 the


fastest
 growing
 AI
 pod
 search
 ads


product.
 In
 Q3
 alone,
 AIMAX
 unlocked


billions
 of
 net
 new
 queries.
 By


delivering
 the
 most
 relevant
 ad
 across


surfaces
 and
 matching
 advertisers


against
 additional
 queries
 they
 weren't


reaching
 before,
 AIMAX
 helps
 advertisers


discover
 new
 customers
 at
 the
 exact


moment
 they
 need
 their
 product
 or


service.


Kayak,
 for
 example,
 looked
 to
 grow


conversions
 while
 staying
 within
 their


rorowass
 goals.
 After
 turning
 on
 AIAX


and
 search,
 they
 grew
 the
 conversion


value
 by
 12%
 in
 early
 tests.
 We
 continue


to
 infuse
 generative
 AI
 capabilities
 at


every
 step
 of
 the
 marketing
 process.
 We


rolled
 out
 Imagin
 4
 in
 asset
 studio
 and


product
 studio
 helping
 businesses


produce
 more
 and
 better
 creatives.
 On


the
 measurement
 front
 we
 enriched
 the


model
 supporting
 Meridian
 our
 marketing


mix
 model
 with
 additional
 variables
 and


more
 granular
 reporting
 in
 PMAX
 is


making
 bidding
 more
 effective.
 Financial


services
 company
 SoFi
 has
 been
 using


PMAX
 to
 meet
 its
 ambitious
 growth


targets
 and
 help
 drive
 a
 39%
 improvement


in
 its
 conversion
 volume
 year-over-year.


Moving
 to
 YouTube,
 where
 we
 saw


accelerated
 revenue
 growth,
 our


recommendation
 systems
 are
 driving


robust
 watchtime
 growth
 in
 our
 key


monetization
 areas
 like
 shorts
 and


living
 room.
 As
 we
 leverage
 Gemini


models,
 we're
 seeing
 further
 discovery


improvement
 on
 direct
 response.
 We're


excited
 about
 the
 growth
 and
 revenue


we're
 seeing,
 especially
 from
 small
 and


medium
 advertisers
 adopting
 demand
 gen.


We
 also
 improved
 performance
 on
 demand


gen
 with
 over
 100
 launches
 helping
 to


increase
 conversion
 value
 by
 more
 than


40%
 for
 advertisers
 using
 target-based


bidding
 on
 YouTube.
 The
 retail
 vertical


continues
 to
 lead
 our
 growth
 on
 YouTube


with
 demand
 genen
 helping
 us
 further


monetize
 shopping
 related
 categories.


Looking
 at
 the
 living
 room,
 a
 long-term


bet
 more
 advertisers
 are
 adopting


interactive
 direct
 response
 ads,
 leading


to
 an
 annual
 revenue
 run
 rate
 exceeding


1
 billion
 globally
 for
 this
 format.
 For


our
 viewers,
 we
 continue
 to
 give
 fans


greater
 access
 across
 sports
 while


tapping
 into
 the

 Sun
 mentioned
 that
 we
 expanded


our
 NFL
 partnership
 with
 our
 first
 ever


exclusive
 global
 broadcast
 of
 an
 NFL


game.
 Brands
 love
 the
 opportunity
 and
 we


sold
 all
 our
 ad
 inventory
 within
 a


couple
 of
 weeks.
 Looking
 at
 creators,
 a


significant
 force
 behind
 the
 thriving


YouTube
 creator
 economy
 is
 the


collaboration
 between
 creators
 and


brands.
 Tools
 like
 direct
 linking
 to


deals,
 websites,
 and
 shorts
 and


swappable
 brand
 segments
 and
 long
 form


will
 soon
 help
 creators
 show
 how
 they


deliver
 great
 value
 for
 brands.

 quicker
 and
 new

 We're
 also
 seeing
 momentum


with
 strong
 growth
 in
 offerings
 such
 as

We're
 also
 applying
 Gemini
 internally
 to


help
 us
 serve

 Our


sales
 teams
 use
 Gemini
 enriched
 with

 This
 increased


productivity
 by
 over
 10%
 led
 to
 hundreds


of
 millions
 in
 incremental

 and


frees
 up
 sellers
 to
 engage
 with
 more


customers
 at
 a
 deeper,
 more

>> Thank
 you,
 Philip.
 My
 comments
 will


focus
 on
 year-over-year
 comparisons
 for


the
 third
 quarter
 unless
 I
 state


otherwise.
 I
 will
 start
 with
 results
 at


the
 alphabet
 level
 and
 we'll
 then
 cover


our
 segment
 results.
 I'll
 end
 with
 some


commentary
 on
 our
 outlook
 for
 the
 fourth


quarter
 of
 2025.


We
 had
 an
 outstanding
 quarter
 in
 Q3,


continuing
 the
 strong
 momentum
 we've
 had


throughout
 the
 year,
 delivering


double-digit
 revenue
 growth
 across


search
 and
 YouTube
 advertising,


subscriptions,
 platforms,
 and
 devices.


and
 Google
 Cloud
 consolidated
 revenue


reached
 $102.3
 billion,
 a
 16%


year-over-year
 increase
 or
 15%
 in


constant
 currency.
 Total
 cost
 of
 revenue


was
 41.4
 billion,
 up
 13%.


Tech
 was
 14.9
 billion,
 up
 8%.
 Other
 cost


of
 revenues
 was
 26.5
 billion
 up
 16%
 with


the
 increase
 primarily
 driven
 by
 content


acquisition
 cost
 largely
 for
 YouTube


followed
 by
 depreciation
 and
 other


technical
 infrastructure
 operations


cost.
 Total
 operating
 expenses
 increased


28%
 to
 29.7
 billion.
 R&D
 expenses


increased
 by
 22%
 driven
 by
 compensation


and
 depreciation
 expenses
 related
 to
 our


AI
 efforts.
 Sales
 and
 marketing
 expenses


were
 flat
 and
 GNA
 expenses
 increased


meaningfully
 primarily
 due
 to
 the
 $3.5


billion
 charge
 related
 to
 the
 European


Commission
 fine
 mentioned
 in
 the


earnings
 press
 release.
 Operating
 income


increased
 9%
 this
 quarter
 to
 $31.2
 2


billion
 and
 operating
 margin
 was
 30.5%.


Excluding
 the
 EC
 fine,
 operating
 income


increased
 22%
 and
 operating
 margin
 was


33.9%.


Operating
 margin
 benefited
 from
 strong


revenue
 growth
 and
 continued


efficiencies
 in
 our
 expense
 base
 offset


by
 the
 legal
 charge
 and
 a
 significant


increase
 in
 depreciation
 expense.


Other
 income
 and
 expenses
 was
 $12.8
 $8


billion
 primarily
 due
 to
 unrealized


gains
 in
 our
 non-marketable
 equity


securities
 portfolio.
 Net
 income


increased
 33%
 to
 $35
 billion
 and


earnings
 per
 share
 increased
 35%
 to


$2.87.


We
 generate
 free
 cash
 flow
 of
 $
 24.5


billion
 in
 the
 third
 quarter
 and
 73.6


billion
 for
 the
 trailing
 12
 months.


free
 cash
 flow
 in
 Q3
 benefited
 from


strong
 operating
 cash
 flow
 and
 recent


tax
 changes
 regarding
 the
 timing
 of
 when


research
 and
 development
 costs
 are


expensed
 and
 assets
 are
 depreciated.


This
 was
 partially
 offset
 by
 higher


capex.


We
 ended
 the
 quarter
 with
 98.5
 billion


in
 cash
 and
 marketable
 securities.


Turning
 to
 segment
 results,
 Google


services
 revenues
 increased
 14%
 to
 87.1


billion,
 reflecting
 strength
 in
 Google


search,
 YouTube
 advertising,
 and


subscriptions.


Google
 search
 and
 other
 advertising


revenues
 increased
 by
 15%
 to
 56.6
 $6


billion,
 representing
 another
 robust


quarter
 with
 continued
 growth
 across
 all


major
 verticals
 with
 the
 largest


contributions
 from
 retail
 and
 financial


services.


YouTube
 advertising
 revenues
 increased


15%
 to
 $10.3
 billion
 driven
 by
 direct


response
 advertising
 followed
 by
 brand.


Network
 advertising
 revenues
 of
 $7.4


billion
 were
 down
 3%.


Subscriptions,
 platforms,
 and
 devices


revenues
 increased
 21%
 this
 quarter
 to


12.9
 billion,
 driven
 by
 very
 strong


growth
 in
 both
 YouTube
 and
 Google
 1


subscriptions.


Google
 services
 operating
 income


increased
 9%
 to
 $33.5
 billion.
 Operating


margin
 declined
 year-over-year
 to
 38.5%


as
 healthy
 revenue
 growth
 and
 continued


efficiencies
 in
 our
 expense
 base
 were


offset
 by
 the
 impact
 of
 the
 EC
 fine


which
 was
 fully
 reflected
 in
 the
 Google


services
 segment.


Turning
 to
 the
 Google
 Cloud
 segment


which
 again
 delivered
 very
 strong


results
 this
 quarter
 as
 cloud
 continued


to
 benefit
 from
 our
 enterprise
 AI


optimized
 stack
 including
 our
 own
 custom


TPUs
 and
 our
 industryleading
 AI
 models.


Cloud
 revenue
 increased
 by
 34%
 to
 15.2


billion
 in
 the
 third
 quarter,
 driven
 by


strong
 performance
 in
 GCP,
 which


continued
 to
 grow
 at
 a
 rate
 that
 was


much
 higher
 than
 cloud's
 overall
 revenue


growth
 rate.
 GCP's
 growth
 was
 driven
 by


enterprise
 AI
 products,
 which
 are


generating
 billions
 in
 quarterly


revenue.
 We
 had
 strong
 growth
 in


enterprise
 AI
 infrastructure
 and


enterprise
 AI
 solutions
 which
 benefited


from
 demand
 for
 our
 industry-leading


models
 including
 Gemini
 2.5.
 Core
 GCP


was
 also
 a
 meaningful
 contributor
 to


growth
 and
 we
 had
 doubledigit
 growth
 in


workspace
 which
 was
 driven
 by
 an


increase
 in
 average
 revenues
 per
 seat


and
 the
 number
 of
 seats.


Cloud
 operating
 income
 increased
 by
 85%


to
 $3.6
 6
 billion
 and
 operating
 margin


increased
 from
 17.1%
 in
 the
 third


quarter
 last
 year
 to
 23.7%
 this
 quarter.


The
 expansion
 in
 cloud
 operating
 margin


was
 driven
 by
 strong
 revenue
 performance


and
 continued
 efficiencies
 in
 our


expense
 base
 partially
 offset
 by
 higher


technical
 infrastructure
 usage
 cost


which
 includes
 depreciation
 expense
 and


other
 operations
 costs
 such
 as
 energy.


Google
 Cloud's
 backlog
 increased
 46%


sequentially
 and
 82%
 year-over-year,


reaching
 $155
 billion
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


third
 quarter.
 The
 increase
 was
 driven


primarily
 by
 strong
 demand
 for


enterprise
 AI.
 As
 Sundar
 mentioned


earlier,
 cloud
 has
 signed
 more
 billion


dollar
 deals
 in
 the
 first
 nine
 months
 of


2025
 than
 in
 the
 past
 two
 years


combined.


In
 other
 bets,
 revenues
 were
 $344


million
 and
 operating
 loss
 was
 a


billion4
 in
 the
 third
 quarter.
 Within


other
 bets,
 we
 continue
 to
 allocate
 more


resources
 to
 businesses
 like
 Whimo,


where
 we
 see
 opportunities
 to
 create


substantial
 value.


With
 respect
 to
 capex,
 in
 the
 third


quarter,
 our
 capex
 was
 $
 24
 billion.
 The


vast
 majority
 of
 our
 capex
 was
 invested


in
 technical
 infrastructure
 with


approximately
 60%
 of
 that
 investment
 in


servers
 and
 40%
 in
 data
 centers
 and


networking
 equipment.


In
 Q3,
 we
 return
 capital
 to
 shareholders


through
 repurchases
 of
 stock
 of
 11.5


billion
 and
 dividend
 payments
 of
 2.5


billion.


Turning
 to
 our
 outlook,
 I
 would
 like
 to


provide
 some
 commentary
 on
 factors
 that


will
 impact
 our
 business
 performance
 in


the
 fourth
 quarter
 of
 2025
 as
 well
 as
 an


updated
 outlook
 for
 capex
 for
 the
 year.


First,
 in
 terms
 of
 revenues,
 we're


pleased
 with
 the
 overall
 momentum
 of
 our


business.
 At
 the
 current
 spot
 rates,
 we


could
 see
 an
 FX
 tailwind
 to
 our
 revenues


in
 Q4.
 However,
 the
 volatility
 and


exchange
 rates
 could
 affect
 the
 impact


of
 FX
 on
 Q4
 revenues.
 As
 for
 segments
 in


Google
 services,
 year-over-year


comparisons
 in
 advertising
 will
 be


negatively
 impacted
 by
 the
 strong
 spend


on
 US
 elections
 in
 the
 fourth
 quarter
 of


2024,
 particularly
 on
 YouTube.


In
 cloud,
 demand
 for
 our
 products


remains
 high
 as
 evidenced
 by
 the


accelerating
 revenue
 growth
 and
 the
 $49


billion
 sequential
 increase
 in
 cloud


backlog
 in
 Q3.


In
 GCP,
 we
 see
 strong
 demand
 for


enterprise
 AI
 infrastructure,
 including


TPUs
 and
 GPUs,
 enterprise
 AI
 solutions


driven
 by
 demand
 for
 Gemini
 2.5
 and
 our


other
 AI
 models
 and
 core
 GCP


infrastructure
 and
 other
 services
 such


as
 cyber
 security
 and
 data
 analytics.


As
 I've
 mentioned
 on
 previous
 earnings


calls,
 while
 we
 have
 been
 working
 hard


to
 increase
 capacity
 and
 have
 improved


the
 pace
 of
 server
 deployments
 and
 data


center
 construction,
 we
 still
 expect
 to


remain
 in
 a
 tight
 demand
 supply


environment
 in
 Q4
 and
 2026.


Moving
 to
 investments,
 we're
 continuing


to
 invest
 aggressively
 due
 to
 the
 demand


we're
 experiencing
 from
 cloud
 customers


as
 well
 as
 the
 growth
 opportunities
 we


see
 across
 the
 company.
 We
 now
 expect


capex
 to
 be
 in
 the
 range
 of
 $91
 billion


to
 $93
 billion
 in
 2025,
 up
 from
 our


previous
 estimate
 of
 $85
 billion.


Keeping
 in
 mind
 that
 the
 timing
 of
 cash


payments
 can
 cause
 variability
 in
 the


reported
 capex
 number.
 Looking
 out
 to


2026,
 we
 expect
 a
 significant
 increase


in
 capex
 and
 we'll
 provide
 more
 detail


on
 our
 fourth
 quarter
 earnings
 call.


In
 terms
 of
 expenses,
 first,
 as
 I've


mentioned
 on
 previous
 earnings
 calls,


the
 significant
 increase
 in
 our


investments
 in
 technical
 infrastructure


will
 continue
 to
 put
 pressure
 on
 the
 P&L


in
 the
 form
 of
 higher
 depreciation


expenses
 and
 related
 data
 center


operations
 costs
 such
 as
 energy.
 In
 the


third
 quarter,
 depreciation
 increased


1.6
 billion
 year-over-year
 to
 5.6


billion,
 reflecting
 a
 growth
 rate
 of


41%.


Given
 the
 overall
 increase
 in
 capex


investments,
 we
 expect
 the
 growth
 rate


and
 depreciation
 to
 accelerate
 slightly


in
 Q4.


Second,
 we
 expect
 sales
 and
 marketing


expenses
 to
 be
 more
 heavily
 weighted
 to


the
 end
 of
 the
 year,
 in
 part
 to
 support


product
 launches
 and
 the
 holiday
 season.


Q3
 was
 a
 strong
 quarter,
 and
 we're


excited
 with
 the
 adoption
 of
 our
 AI


products,
 helped
 by
 a
 rapid
 pace
 of


innovation
 and
 great
 execution
 by
 our


teams.
 This
 translated
 into
 strong


momentum
 in
 search,
 YouTube
 ads,


subscription
 platforms
 and
 devices
 and


cloud
 resulting
 in
 our
 first
 hundred


billion
 dollar
 plus
 quarter.
 Now
 Sundar


Philip
 and
 I
 will
 now
 take
 your


questions.


>> Thank
 you.
 As
 a
 reminder,
 to
 ask
 a


question,
 you
 will
 need
 to
 press
 star


one
 on
 your
 telephone.
 To
 prevent
 any


background
 noise,
 we
 ask
 that
 you
 please


mute
 your
 line
 once
 your
 question
 has


been
 stated.
 Our
 first
 question
 comes


from
 Brian
 Noak
 with
 Morgan
 Stanley.


Your
 line
 is
 now
 open.


>> Great.
 Thanks
 for
 taking
 my
 questions


everyone.
 Uh
 the
 first
 one
 maybe
 for
 for


Philip
 or
 or
 Sundar.
 It's
 on
 Agentic


e-commerce
 and
 Agentic
 Travel.
 There's
 a


lot
 of
 external
 Wall
 Street
 discussion


about
 Agentic
 e-commerce
 potentially


monetizing
 at
 a
 lower
 rate
 than
 search.


So
 the
 the
 question
 is
 what
 what
 factors


are
 you
 most
 focused
 on
 to
 sort
 of


ensure
 a
 smooth
 transition
 for
 your


search
 business
 and
 for
 your
 advertisers


as
 you
 move
 over
 to
 a
 more
 agentic
 world


and
 the
 second
 one
 Sundar
 is
 on
 Whimo.


How
 far
 are
 we
 from
 an
 integration
 of


Whimo
 into
 more
 of
 the
 the
 core
 Gemini


capabilities
 and
 the
 users
 in
 the


platform?
 you're
 taking
 your
 your
 user


data
 of
 where
 I'm
 going,
 what
 hotel
 I'm


staying
 at,
 what
 airport
 I'm
 staying
 at,


and
 have
 me
 integrate
 that
 into
 Whimo.


You
 can
 actually
 have
 users
 use
 their


profiles
 to
 preschedule
 Whimos.
 How
 how


far
 off
 is
 that?
 What
 do
 we
 have
 to
 do?


>> Hello,
 Brian.
 Great
 question.
 Uh,
 this


is
 all
 early.
 Uh,
 but
 we
 see
 agentic


experiences
 really
 as
 additive
 to
 the


way
 people
 seek
 information.
 Uh,
 it


helps
 us
 answers,
 uh,
 people's
 tough


questions.
 It
 helps
 us
 uh
 it
 helps


people
 get
 stuff
 done
 and
 it
 helps


businesses
 in
 the
 process.
 And
 uh
 we're


working
 on
 multiple
 agentic
 experiences


across
 key
 verticals
 such
 as
 travel,


commerce,
 shopping
 and
 so
 on.
 And
 we're


paying
 a
 lot
 of
 attention
 to
 creating
 a


seamless
 user
 experience,
 but
 also
 to


the
 fact
 that
 we
 need
 to
 integrate


different
 partner
 ecosystems
 in
 a
 way


that
 creates
 value
 for
 them.
 And
 uh
 by


the
 way,
 we're
 also
 working
 closely
 with


a
 lot
 of
 our
 partners
 on
 the
 other
 side


through
 our
 cloud
 services
 to
 improve


their
 own
 agentic
 experiences.
 And
 uh
 so


maybe
 we
 go
 a
 little
 deeper
 on
 the


shopping
 side
 um
 where
 we
 actually
 use


AI
 already
 uh
 very
 actively
 to
 improve


the
 shopping
 experience.
 Um
 as
 you
 know


uh
 we
 launched
 a
 more
 visual
 experience


on
 AI
 mode
 that
 gives
 people
 a
 much
 more


intuitive
 conversational
 way
 to
 shop.
 um


you
 can
 simply
 describe
 what
 you're


looking
 for
 now
 like
 the
 way
 you
 would


talk
 to
 a
 friend
 and
 it
 will
 show
 you


the
 visual
 shopping
 results.
 Uh
 and
 then


we
 think
 about
 building
 an
 agentic


shopping
 future
 and
 it
 has
 to
 be
 one


again
 that
 benefits
 both
 users
 and


merchants
 here
 and
 you
 know
 that
 AIO
 we


also
 introduced
 new
 agentic
 checkout
 u


which
 will
 let
 shoppers
 use
 uh
 like


aentic
 AI
 to
 buy
 products
 from
 merchant


sites
 and
 so
 on.
 Um
 we
 have
 a


partnership
 with
 PayPal
 uh
 to
 help


merchants
 build
 aentic
 commerce


experiences.
 as
 we
 have
 a
 new
 open


protocols
 for
 agent
 to
 agent


transactions
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 on.


>> And
 uh
 Brian
 on
 Whimo
 uh
 great
 question.


I
 was
 reflecting
 I
 think
 on
 the
 exact


same
 topic.
 I'm
 I'm
 scheduled
 to
 meet


with
 the
 team
 to
 do
 a
 review
 on
 it
 in
 a


few
 weeks
 out.
 uh
 look
 it
 is
 an
 exciting


time
 clearly
 you
 know
 is
 scaling
 up


particularly
 uh
 in
 2026


and
 I
 think
 the
 possibility
 as
 you
 said


of
 uh
 you
 know
 Gemini
 particularly
 with


the
 multimodal
 experience
 as
 well
 as


services
 like
 YouTube
 I
 think
 there's
 a


real
 opportunity
 to
 make
 the
 uh
 incar


experience
 uh
 dramatically
 better
 uh


definitely
 something
 we
 are
 excited


about
 and
 you'll
 see
 newer
 experiences


uh
 in
 in
 2026
 for


Great.
 Thank
 you
 both.


>> Our
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 Doug
 Anuth


with
 JP
 Morgan.
 Your
 line
 is
 now
 open.


>> Thanks
 for
 taking
 the
 questions.
 Um,


Philip
 u
 maybe
 you
 can
 just
 talk
 more


about
 uh
 some
 of
 the
 drivers
 of
 the
 core


search
 strength
 and
 I
 guess
 in


particular
 when
 you
 think
 about
 AI


overviews
 and
 AI
 mode.
 We
 know
 that


query
 growth
 is
 accelerating,
 but
 can


you
 help
 us
 understand
 from
 there
 kind


of
 what
 happens
 in
 terms
 of
 clicks
 per


query
 and
 conversion
 rates
 and
 pricing


in
 these
 AIdriven
 search
 formats?
 And


then
 um
 Anat,
 uh
 can
 you
 talk
 about


where
 you
 see
 opportunities
 in
 the
 core


cost
 space
 as
 you
 look
 to
 make
 room
 to


absorb
 the
 rapid
 growth
 in


infrastructure
 and
 depreciation
 going


forward?
 Thanks.


So
 let
 me
 give
 you
 a
 bit
 of
 vertical


color
 first.
 In
 Q3
 uh
 three
 search
 and


other
 revenues
 again
 delivered
 growth


across
 all
 major
 vertical
 as
 we
 said
 uh


was
 from
 retail
 and
 financial
 services.


Healthcare
 was
 also
 a
 contributor
 to
 the


growth
 here.
 Um
 our
 new
 AI
 experiences


um
 you
 mentioned
 them
 AI
 overviews
 AI


mode
 continue
 to
 drive
 growth
 uh
 in


overall
 queries
 including
 commercial


queries
 uh
 really
 creating
 more


opportunities
 uh
 for
 monetization.
 Um,


AI
 overviews
 are
 scaling
 up
 and
 are


working
 for
 our
 entire
 user
 base.
 We're


now
 scaled
 to
 over
 two
 billion
 users


here
 and
 uh
 we're
 continuing
 to
 expand


ads
 in
 AI
 overviews
 in
 English
 to
 more


countries
 uh
 across
 desktop,
 mobile
 and


so
 on.
 And
 as
 I've
 said
 before
 for
 AI


overviews,
 even
 at
 our
 current
 baseline


of
 ads
 um
 below
 and
 within
 the
 AI's


response
 overall,
 we
 see
 the


monetization
 at
 approximately
 the
 same


rate.
 Uh
 so
 over
 time
 we're
 excited


about
 the
 opportunity
 of
 uh
 richer


experiences
 in
 AI
 mode
 and
 AI
 overviews


uh
 to
 basically
 open
 up
 then
 the


opportunity
 for
 also
 uh
 much
 richer
 uh


placements.
 Um
 and
 um
 I
 think
 as
 I've


said
 on
 a
 a
 prior
 call,
 we
 managed
 the


business
 to
 drive
 great
 outcomes
 for


users
 and
 an
 attractive
 RORI
 for


advertisers.
 Uh
 we
 don't
 really
 manage


to
 paid
 clicks
 and
 uh
 CPC
 targets.
 Um


but
 uh
 as
 you
 will
 see
 in
 the
 10Q
 uh


paid
 clicks
 were
 up
 uh
 7%
 year
 on
 year


and
 CPCs
 were
 up
 uh
 7%
 year
 on
 year.


Doug,
 into
 your
 question
 around
 where


else
 can
 we
 see
 more
 um
 opportunity
 for


efficiency
 and
 productivity
 and
 I
 think


you
 heard
 me
 say
 before
 this
 is
 not
 a


one-time
 type
 of
 effort
 but
 rather
 an


ongoing
 way
 in
 which
 we
 manage
 the


business
 and
 the
 key
 here
 is
 that
 the


more
 we
 drive
 productivity
 across
 our


business
 the
 more
 we
 can
 invest
 in
 the


business
 for
 growth
 and
 obviously


continue
 to
 uh
 drive
 improvement
 in
 the


P&L.
 Some
 of
 the
 areas
 are
 things
 that


you've
 heard
 us
 talk
 about
 in
 the
 past


such
 as
 uh
 moderating
 the
 pace
 of


headcount
 growth,
 optimizing
 uh
 real


estate
 footprint,
 but
 also
 as
 we
 invest


more
 and
 more
 in
 our
 technical


infrastructure,
 ensuring
 that
 we
 are


optimizing
 that
 buildout
 and
 um
 the


overall
 technical
 infrastructure
 we


have,
 you
 know,
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 data


centers
 for
 example
 that
 we
 we
 build


ourselves,
 so
 they're
 uh
 optimized
 and


we
 make
 sure
 we
 do
 them
 in
 the
 most


efficient
 way.
 uh
 Sundar
 mentioned
 uh
 in


on
 one
 of
 the
 previous
 calls
 the


productivity
 associated
 with
 leveraging


AI
 for
 Google.
 So
 it
 is
 the
 example
 the


uh
 the
 percent
 of
 code
 now
 nearly
 half


of
 all
 code
 generated
 by
 AI
 that's
 a
 way


for
 us
 to
 leverage
 AI
 to
 drive
 further


productivity
 um
 across
 the
 business
 and


obviously
 we
 always
 look
 at
 making
 sure


that
 when
 we
 provide
 services
 or


products
 that
 we
 get
 the
 right
 economics


and
 the
 right
 value
 for
 what
 we
 provide.


So
 the
 one
 good
 example
 is
 shorts
 which


has
 a
 lower
 revenue
 share
 than
 instream


that
 it
 helps
 to
 improve
 uh
 some
 of
 our


gross
 margins.
 So
 this
 is
 an
 effort
 we


have
 ongoing
 I've
 mentioned
 in
 the
 past


that
 we
 have
 a
 headwind
 with


depreciation
 obviously
 increasing


alongside
 our
 capex
 increase.
 So
 we're


have
 we
 have
 efforts
 across
 the


organization
 to
 ensure
 we
 we
 run
 the


business
 in
 the
 most
 disciplined
 and


productive
 way
 while
 continue
 to
 invest


for
 future
 growth.


Thank
 you
 both.


>> Our
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 Eric


Sheridan
 with
 Goldman
 Sachs.
 Your
 line


is
 now
 open.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 taking
 the


questions.
 Maybe
 two
 if
 I
 could.
 Sundar,


when
 you
 think
 about
 your
 custom
 silicon


efforts
 across
 the
 organization,
 can
 you


reflect
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the


opportunity
 set
 you
 see
 with
 each


passing
 generation
 of
 custom
 silicon


both
 in
 terms
 of
 driving
 operating


efficiencies
 inside
 the
 organization
 and


potentially
 uh
 increased
 monetization


efforts
 around
 those
 outside
 of
 the


organization.
 Um,
 second
 question
 would


be
 for
 Philip.
 Um,
 obviously
 we
 can
 see


the
 YouTube
 advertising
 revenue
 number


in
 the
 reported
 results.
 Can
 you
 reflect


a
 little
 bit
 about
 the
 scaling
 of
 the


subscription
 side
 of
 YouTube
 offerings


and
 how
 the
 two
 parts
 in
 in
 together


maybe
 present
 an
 interesting
 framework


in
 thinking
 about
 the
 monetization
 side


of
 YouTube
 uh
 increasingly
 being
 a
 mix


of
 both
 ads
 and
 subscription.
 Thank
 you


>> Eric.
 Um
 overall
 I
 would
 say
 we
 are


seeing
 you
 know
 substantial
 demand
 for


our
 AI
 infrastructure
 products
 uh


including
 TPU
 based
 and
 GPU
 based
 uh


solutions.


It
 is
 one
 of
 the
 key
 drivers
 of
 our


growth
 over
 the
 past
 year
 and
 I
 I
 think


on
 a
 going
 forward
 basis.
 I
 think
 we


continue
 to
 see
 uh
 very
 strong
 uh
 demand


and
 we
 are
 investing
 uh
 to
 meet
 that.
 uh


I
 do
 think
 a
 big
 part
 of
 what
 uh


differentiates
 Google
 cloud
 uh
 you
 know


effectively
 we
 are
 the
 you
 know
 we've


taken
 a
 full
 deep
 full
 stack
 approach
 to


AI
 so
 we
 are
 and
 and
 that
 really
 plays


out
 right
 we
 are
 the
 only
 hyperscaler


who
 is
 really
 building
 offerings
 on
 our


own
 models
 um
 you
 know
 and
 and
 we
 we
 are


also
 highly
 differentiated
 on
 our
 own


technology
 so
 to
 your
 question
 I
 think


that
 does
 uh
 you
 know
 give
 us
 the
 opport


opportunity
 to
 uh
 continue


driving
 growth
 in
 operating
 margins
 in


cloud
 as
 we've
 done
 in
 the
 past
 and
 and


also
 I
 think
 from
 a
 revenue
 uh
 you
 know


uh
 sets
 the
 infrastructure
 portion
 of


our
 business
 uh
 to
 be
 to
 be
 a
 growth


driver
 looking
 ahead
 as
 well


>> and
 to
 the
 second
 part
 of
 your
 question


look
 just
 taking
 a
 quick
 step
 back
 uh


you
 know
 we
 often
 describe
 YouTube's


business
 as
 a
 flywheel
 obviously
 it


first
 all
 starts
 with
 the
 creators
 and


we
 have
 significantly
 invested
 here
 to


be
 the
 place
 that
 YouTube
 creators


really
 call
 uh
 their
 home.
 Uh
 that's
 a


big
 piece
 of
 it.
 Uh
 the
 number
 one
 piece


uh
 viewers
 of
 course
 uh
 YouTube
 has


billions
 of
 monthly
 logged
 in
 users
 and


every
 day
 people
 watch
 billions
 of
 hours


of
 video
 and
 we
 talked
 about
 how


recommendation
 systems
 are
 driving


robust
 watchtime
 growth
 uh
 and
 so
 on
 and


so
 on.
 So
 on
 the
 monetization
 side
 uh


YouTube's
 business
 is
 really
 powered
 I


would
 say
 on
 a
 let's
 call
 it
 a
 twin


engine
 monetization
 strategy
 combining


its
 advertising
 business
 and
 its
 growing


sub
 subscription
 services.
 uh
 both


YouTube
 ads
 and
 subscriptions
 saw
 strong


growth
 uh
 this
 quarter
 and
 so
 looking
 at


YouTube
 music
 and
 premium
 uh
 users
 are


on
 average
 delivering
 more
 value
 to


creators
 uh
 to
 music
 uh
 media
 partners


and
 YouTube
 itself
 than
 even
 adup


supported
 users
 do.
 So
 in
 other
 words
 on


average
 a
 YouTube
 music
 and
 premium


subscriber
 generates
 a
 meaningful
 high


gross
 profit
 uh
 than
 they
 were
 simply
 an


ad
 supported
 users
 and
 uh
 fans
 come
 from


all
 over
 the
 world
 uh
 you
 know
 this
 and


this
 engagement
 through
 ads
 and


subscription
 generates
 YouTube's


revenues
 and
 funds
 what
 I
 started
 with


these
 uh
 creators
 here
 and
 this
 then


drives
 more
 viewership
 and
 engagement


and
 so
 on
 and
 that's
 the
 flywheel
 and
 so


our
 priority
 continues
 like
 this
 growth


cycle
 we're
 happy
 with
 this
 twin
 engine


monetization
 strategy


Our
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 Mark


Schmullik
 with
 Bernstein.
 Your
 line
 is


now
 open.


>> Uh
 yes,
 thanks
 for
 taking
 the
 questions.


Uh
 Sundar,
 you
 know,
 with
 the
 strong


adoption
 of
 Gemini,
 AI
 mode
 and


overviews
 across
 the
 user
 base.
 Are


there
 any
 meaningful
 differences
 to
 call


out
 kind
 of
 around
 the
 behavior
 and


depth
 of
 engagement
 for
 those
 users


across
 the
 entire
 Google
 ecosystem?
 Uh


and
 then
 Philip,
 I
 know
 we
 kind
 of
 asked


this
 uh
 you
 know
 most
 quarters,
 but
 I'm


I'm
 curious
 kind
 of
 with
 some
 of
 the


adoption
 you've
 seen
 around
 AI
 overviews


and
 mode,
 you
 know,
 how
 you
 see
 the


economics
 of
 search
 evolving
 with
 the


higher
 commercial
 and
 total
 query
 volume


and
 how
 it
 kind
 of
 compares
 against
 the


incremental
 cost
 to
 deliver
 these


results.
 Thank
 you


>> Mark.
 Um
 look,
 I
 think
 obviously
 AIO


views
 are
 a
 natural
 part
 of
 the
 Google


experience
 and
 so
 you
 know
 engagement
 is


very
 very
 high.
 I
 would
 say
 AI
 mode
 you


you
 have
 a
 a
 varied
 cohorts
 there
 are


people
 who
 are
 casual
 users
 who
 are


checking
 it
 out
 and
 then
 but
 there's
 a


core
 group
 which
 which
 really
 likes
 AI


mode
 and
 is
 passionate
 about
 it
 and
 so


you
 see
 the
 early
 adopters
 uh
 uh
 you


know
 the
 product
 is
 resonating
 very


strongly
 and
 they
 are
 seeking
 it
 out
 so


I
 think
 I
 think
 that's
 how
 I
 would


highlight
 the
 difference
 with
 Gemini


again
 uh
 you
 know
 sort
 of
 engaged
 user


base
 who
 who
 are
 seeking
 out
 the
 product


and
 and
 so
 on
 but
 across
 the
 board
 I


think
 um
 you
 know
 the
 trajectory
 has


been
 we
 are
 we
 are
 definitely
 seeing
 in


each
 of
 those
 use
 cases
 a
 set
 of
 early


adopters
 and
 then
 more
 people
 coming
 in


and
 the
 people
 who
 are
 using
 it
 continue


to
 use
 it
 more
 over
 time
 and
 report
 high


user
 satisfaction.
 So
 I
 would
 say
 the


underlying
 product
 metrics
 uh
 are
 are


pretty
 uh
 encouraging
 uh
 to
 see
 as
 well.


look
 into
 the
 second
 part
 of
 your


question.
 Um
 I
 think
 we
 covered
 before


SA
 covered
 the
 query
 development
 and
 as


I've
 just
 said
 before
 for
 the
 AI


overviews
 even
 at
 our
 current
 baseline


of
 ads
 right
 whether
 above
 below
 and


within
 the
 AI
 response
 overall
 we
 see


the
 monetization
 at
 approximately
 the


same
 rate
 and
 this
 is
 a
 a
 great
 baseline


for
 further
 innovation.
 Um,
 we
 talked


about
 this.
 We're
 excited
 about
 where


this
 can
 go.
 And,
 uh,
 on
 the
 AI
 mode


side,
 uh,
 we're
 testing
 ads
 in
 AI
 mode


and
 we'll
 continue
 to
 test
 and
 learn.


Uh,
 before
 we
 expand
 this
 any
 further,


um,
 so
 this
 in
 combination
 with
 what
 we


mentioned
 about
 the
 commercial
 query,


uh,
 overall
 development,
 uh,
 I
 think


we're
 in
 a
 we're
 in
 a
 good
 place
 here.


Um,
 you
 could
 also
 argue
 that
 on
 queries


that
 historically
 have
 not
 been
 well


monetized,
 uh,
 we
 think
 there's
 a


potential
 opportunity
 here,
 um,
 where


you
 can
 obviously
 imagine
 that
 we
 can


build
 this
 out
 with
 smart
 AI


integration.


>> Our
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 Michael


Nathansson
 with
 Muffet
 Nathansson.
 Your


line
 is
 now
 open.


>> Thanks.
 I
 have
 two,
 one
 for
 Phil,
 one


for
 not
 Philip.
 Um,
 it's
 clear
 that
 when


people
 use
 AI
 mode,
 the
 query
 length
 is


is
 much
 longer.
 Could
 you
 talk
 about
 how


that
 longer
 length
 may
 be
 impacting
 your


ability
 to
 drive
 rorowaz
 and
 what
 you're


seeing
 in
 terms
 some
 of
 the
 early
 the


benefits
 of
 maybe
 longer
 query.
 You
 you


came
 um
 to
 Alphabet
 from
 a


pharmaceutical
 company.
 You've
 been


there
 more
 than
 a
 year.
 Can
 you
 talk
 a


bit
 about
 how
 you're
 working
 to
 look
 at


ROIC
 internally
 and
 what
 early
 signs
 are


you
 seeing
 that
 gives
 you
 confidence


that
 this
 spending
 is
 you
 know
 is
 really


driving
 better
 returns
 longer
 term.


Thanks.


>> Look
 as
 Sund
 shared
 AI
 mode
 now
 has
 over


like
 75
 million
 daily
 active
 users
 in


the
 US
 and
 we
 see
 strong
 and
 consistent


we
 growth
 in
 usage
 uh
 since
 launch
 and


the
 queries
 doubled
 over
 the
 quarter.
 Um


and
 as
 I
 also
 mentioned
 we're
 testing


ads
 in
 AI
 mode.
 We'll
 continue
 to
 le
 uh


test
 before
 we
 expand
 any
 further.
 It's


really
 too
 early
 to
 tell
 and
 go
 into
 any


of
 the
 details
 of
 that
 testing.


>> Okay.


>> Yes.
 And
 the
 uh
 the
 question
 related
 to


ROIC
 and
 how
 we
 look
 at
 um
 just
 overall


our
 business
 and
 where
 do
 we
 see
 early


signs
 that
 are
 encouraging.
 So
 first
 I


would
 say
 it's
 not
 just
 early
 signs


because
 we're
 seeing
 returns
 obviously


in
 in
 the
 cloud
 business.
 You've
 heard


us
 talk
 about
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 already


are
 generating
 billions
 of
 dollars
 from


AI
 in
 the
 quarter.
 But
 then
 across
 the


board
 we
 have
 a
 a
 rigorous
 framework
 and


approach
 by
 which
 we
 evaluate
 um
 these


long-term
 investments
 that
 are
 meant
 to


do
 two
 things.
 One
 is
 to
 ensure
 we
 have


we
 build
 a
 resilient
 growth
 profile
 for


the
 company
 but
 also
 that
 we
 meet
 the


demand
 of
 the
 customers
 that
 we
 have


here
 in
 the
 in
 the
 more
 near
 and


midterm.
 So
 we
 look
 at
 it
 across
 the


business.
 We
 evaluate
 the
 potential


return
 for
 each
 one
 of
 them
 whether
 it's


um
 in
 cloud
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 more


visible
 obviously
 externally
 given
 uh


that
 you
 see
 the
 the
 revenue
 generated


and
 the
 fact
 that
 we're
 unable
 to
 meet


at
 this
 point
 customer
 demand
 we
 have


more
 demand
 than
 we
 have
 supplied
 um
 in


our
 ads
 business
 you
 see
 the
 the
 fact


that
 we're
 investing
 to
 transform
 search


as
 you
 heard
 from
 Philip
 and
 Serno
 with


AIO
 in
 a
 uh
 mode
 so
 we're
 um
 and
 excited


to
 see
 what
 what
 our
 investments
 are


help
 investors
 are
 helping
 um


advertisers
 as
 well.
 Uh
 YouTube
 where


it's
 helping
 power
 recommendations.
 So


we're
 we're
 when
 we
 make
 a
 decision
 on


investment
 in
 the
 long
 term,
 we
 go


through
 a
 very
 rigorous
 process
 of


assessing
 what
 the
 return
 could
 be
 and


over
 what
 time
 frame
 we
 will
 see
 that


return
 to
 give
 us
 the
 high
 level
 of


confidence
 to
 then
 invest
 and
 make
 those


investments
 for
 for
 the
 long
 term.
 So


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 very
 um
 rigorous
 approach.


Thanks.


>> Our
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 Ross


Sandler
 with
 Barclays.
 Your
 line
 is
 now


open.


>> Great.
 Um,
 about
 20%
 of
 Google's
 search


queries
 are
 are
 commercial
 historically


and
 you
 you've
 talked
 a
 bunch
 on
 this


call
 about
 how
 AI
 overviews
 are
 kind
 of


expanding
 the
 breadth
 of
 queries.
 Um,


could
 you
 talk
 about
 how
 new
 products
 on


the
 monetization
 side
 like
 AI
 Max
 are


potentially
 increasing
 the
 percent
 of


commercial
 queries?


So


look,
 AIAX
 and
 I
 mentioned
 this
 in
 my


call
 before
 improves
 the
 ability
 for


advertisers
 to
 target
 a
 wider
 range
 of


queries.
 separately
 there
 is
 the


question
 of
 whether
 queries
 uh
 actually


increase
 with
 AI
 mode
 and
 I
 sar
 actually


talked
 about
 it
 uh
 and
 mentioned
 the


opportunity
 that
 he
 sees
 here.
 So
 I


think
 it's
 important
 uh
 to
 separate


those
 two
 things
 and
 I
 personally
 also


see
 this
 is
 what
 I
 just
 said
 in
 my
 last


remark
 that
 I
 think
 over
 time
 there's
 an


opportunity
 to
 actually
 take
 uh
 let's


say
 queries
 that
 are
 not
 fully


commercial
 but
 could
 have
 an
 adjacent
 uh


commercial
 relationship
 to
 basically


expand
 this
 into
 more
 attractive
 uh
 ads


offerings
 without
 or
 while
 really


creating
 an
 really
 interesting
 user


experience
 at
 the
 same
 time.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 the
 only
 thing
 I
 would
 add


is
 just
 stepping
 back
 broadly.
 I
 think


AIO
 views
 in
 AI
 mode
 are
 you
 know


dramatically
 improving
 search.
 We
 can


see
 it
 in
 uh
 user
 satisfaction,
 user


quality,
 all
 our
 metrics
 and
 they


universal
 in
 the
 nature.
 They
 apply


across
 uh
 the
 universality
 of
 human


needs.
 So
 I
 think
 we
 are
 we
 are
 seeing


it
 in
 breadth
 and
 so
 you
 know
 naturally


over
 time
 that'll
 apply
 to
 commercial


categories
 as
 well.


Our
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 Ken


Geralski
 with
 Wells
 Fargo.
 Your
 line
 is


now
 open.


Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Two
 questions,


please.
 First
 um
 it
 it
 it
 appears
 more


and
 more
 clear
 that
 um
 all
 the
 new
 modes


whether
 uh
 at
 Google
 with
 Gemini


overview
 AI
 overviews
 AI
 mode
 even
 catch


EPT
 is
 growing
 the
 addressable
 market
 uh


for
 engagement
 in
 search
 like
 behavior.


Could
 you
 talk
 about
 what
 gives
 you


confidence
 that
 it
 will
 also
 grow
 the


addressable
 market
 for
 marketing


activity
 and
 overall
 revenue
 associated


with
 that
 behavior?
 That
 that's
 question


one.
 And
 and
 question
 two
 is
 just
 more


about
 as
 you
 think
 about
 uh
 AI
 mode,
 AI


overviews
 and
 and
 traditional
 Google


search.
 Um
 h
 how
 do
 you
 think
 do
 do
 you


see
 a
 world
 in
 you
 know
 12
 to
 24
 months


those
 all
 coexist?
 And
 does
 the
 user


does
 the
 user
 eventually
 pick
 what
 what


uh
 what
 mode
 they
 want?
 Is
 does
 the


algorithm
 pick
 the
 the
 mode?
 Could
 you


talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 how
 how
 you


think
 that
 will
 progress
 over
 the
 next


12
 to
 24
 months?
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.


>> Uh
 Ken,
 thanks.
 Look,
 I
 think
 um
 you


know
 it's
 a
 dynamic
 moment
 and
 you
 know


I
 think
 uh
 we
 are
 uh
 meeting
 people
 uh


in
 the
 moment
 with
 the
 with
 what
 they


are
 trying
 to
 do.
 uh
 obviously
 search
 is


evolving
 and


you
 know
 between
 AI
 overviews
 and
 AI


mode
 I
 think
 we
 are
 we
 are
 able
 to
 kind


of
 give
 that
 range
 of
 experience
 uh
 for


people
 in
 this
 moment
 over
 time
 you
 will


expect
 us
 to
 you
 can
 expect
 us
 uh
 to


make
 the
 experiences
 simpler
 um
 uh
 in
 a


way
 that
 just
 like
 we
 did
 universal


search
 many
 many
 years
 ago
 we
 may
 have


done
 text
 search
 image
 search
 video


search
 etc
 and
 then
 we
 kind
 of
 brought


brought
 it
 together
 as
 universal
 search.


So
 you
 will
 see
 evolutions
 like
 that.


But
 I
 think
 I
 think
 we
 we
 want
 to
 be


sensitive
 to
 making
 sure
 we
 are
 meeting


the
 users


uh
 uh
 you
 know
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 they
 are


looking
 for.
 I
 think
 Gemini
 allows
 us
 uh


to
 build
 a
 more
 personal,
 proactive,


powerful
 AI
 assistant
 for
 that
 moment.


And
 and
 I
 think
 I
 think
 having
 the
 two


surfaces,
 search
 and
 Gemini
 allows
 us
 to


really
 serve
 users
 across
 the
 breadth
 of


their
 uh
 needs.
 And
 but
 over
 time,
 we


will,
 you
 know,
 thoughtfully
 look
 for
 uh


opportunities
 to
 make
 the
 experience
 uh


better
 for
 users.
 And
 to
 the
 first
 part,


I
 would
 I
 would
 broadly
 say,
 you
 know,


as
 as
 you
 know,
 I
 do
 think
 we
 we've
 been


consistently
 saying
 for
 a
 while
 now,
 uh


this
 is
 an
 expansionary
 moment
 and
 and


and


we
 are
 seeing
 people
 engage
 more
 and
 and


I
 think
 when
 they
 do
 that,
 uh
 naturally


a
 portion
 of
 that
 information
 for
 users


those
 journeys
 are
 commercial
 in
 nature.


So
 I
 would
 expect
 that
 to
 play
 out
 over


time
 as
 well.


Our


last
 question
 comes
 from
 Justin
 Post


with
 BAML.
 Your
 line
 is
 now
 open.


>> Great.
 Just
 a
 couple.
 Um,
 Senator,
 I


think
 you
 mentioned
 Gemini
 3
 is
 coming.


Maybe
 you
 comment
 on
 the
 pace
 of


innovation
 in
 frontier
 models.
 Is
 there


still
 just
 a
 tremendous
 amount
 of


innovation
 or
 or
 is
 it
 slowing
 at
 all?


And
 then
 you
 mentioned,
 you
 know,
 a


number
 of
 large
 deals
 signed
 in
 the
 last


nine
 months
 for
 cloud,
 which
 is
 great.


any
 any
 changes
 in
 the
 economics
 of


these
 deals
 as
 far
 as
 u
 you
 know


long-term
 profitability
 uh
 anything
 we


should
 be
 aware
 of?
 Thank
 you.


>> Thanks
 Justin.
 Uh
 the
 first
 on
 the
 on
 on


on
 the
 on
 the
 pace
 of
 Frontier
 Model
 uh


research
 and
 development.
 Look
 I
 think


you
 know
 two
 things
 are
 both


simultaneously
 true.
 I'm
 I'm
 incredibly


impressed
 by
 the
 pace
 at
 which
 the
 the


teams
 are
 executing
 and
 and
 the
 pace
 at


which
 we
 are
 uh
 improving
 these
 models.


uh
 but
 it
 also
 is
 true
 at
 the
 same
 time


that
 each
 of
 the
 prior
 model
 you're


trying
 to
 get
 better
 over
 is
 now
 getting


more
 and
 more
 capable.
 So
 I
 think
 both


the
 pace
 is
 increasing
 but
 sometimes
 we


are
 taking
 the
 time
 to
 put
 out
 a
 uh
 you


know
 a
 notably
 uh
 improved
 improved


model.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 may
 take
 slightly


longer
 uh
 but
 I
 I
 do
 think
 the


underlying
 pace
 uh
 is
 is
 uh
 phenomenal


to
 see
 and
 I'm
 excited
 about
 uh
 our


Gemini
 3.0
 release
 later
 this
 year.


on
 on
 cloud.
 Um
 you
 know
 I
 mean
 I
 I


would
 I
 would
 point
 out
 as
 a
 sign
 of
 the


momentum
 I
 think
 the
 number
 of
 uh
 deals


greater
 than
 $1
 billion
 that
 we
 signed


you
 know
 in
 the
 first
 three
 quarters
 of


this
 year
 are
 greater
 than
 the
 two
 years


prior.
 So
 we
 are
 definitely
 uh
 seeing


strong
 momentum
 uh
 and
 we
 are
 executing


at
 pace
 and
 in
 terms
 of
 long-term
 uh


economics
 you
 know
 I
 would
 say
 that


again
 us
 being
 a
 full
 stack
 uh
 AI
 player


and
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 are
 uh
 developing


highly
 differentiated
 products
 on
 our


own
 technology
 I
 think
 will
 help
 us
 uh


you
 know
 drive
 a
 good
 trajectory
 here
 as


you
 have
 seen
 over
 the
 past
 a
 few
 years.


>> Great.
 Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you.
 And
 that
 concludes
 our


question
 and
 answer
 session
 for
 today.


I'd
 like
 to
 turn
 the
 conference
 back


over
 to
 Jim
 Freedelland
 for
 any
 further


remarks.


>> Thanks
 everyone
 for
 joining
 us
 today.
 We


look
 forward
 to
 speaking
 with
 you
 again


on
 our
 fourth
 quarter
 2025
 call.
 Thank


you
 and
 have
 a
 good
 evening.


>> Okay,


there
 we
 go.
 Jose,
 raw
 thoughts
 on
 what


you
 heard
 from
 the
 Googs.


>> I
 mean,
 for
 me,
 obviously,
 the


excitement
 comes
 in
 the
 AI
 space.
 They


mentioned
 uh
 capacity
 constraints
 still.


Uh
 they're
 going
 to
 continue
 and
 well,


uh
 we
 were
 listening
 to
 that.
 Um


obviously,
 we
 didn't
 uh
 listen
 to
 the


Microsoft
 call,
 but
 they
 mentioned
 very


similar
 stuff,
 right?
 So,
 uh
 all
 three


companies
 today,
 Meta
 mentions
 that
 one


thing
 that
 they're
 seeing
 is
 as
 they


build
 comp
 uh
 compute
 capacity,
 they


continue
 to
 need
 more.
 Google
 said
 the


same
 thing
 and
 Microsoft
 said
 that
 by


the
 end
 of
 this
 fiscal
 year
 there's


still
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 compute


constraints.
 So
 overall
 extremely


bullish
 in
 my
 opinion
 for
 the
 trend
 of


the
 overall
 AI
 ecosystem.
 One
 can
 say


bullish
 for
 Broadcom,
 Nvidia,
 AMV,


whoever,
 but
 just
 the
 overall
 ecosystem


uh
 looks
 pretty
 exciting.
 Um
 because
 a


lot
 of
 these
 companies
 say
 they're
 just


they're
 not
 investing
 on
 future
 demand.


They're
 investing
 on
 the
 demand
 that


they
 need
 right
 now.
 Um
 and
 I
 I
 believe


at least
 for
 the
 next
 few
 quarters
 we're


going
 to
 continue
 to
 see
 this.
 And
 um


Google
 increased
 capex.
 We
 also
 see


reports
 that
 I
 I
 haven't
 heard
 but
 it


was
 reading
 that
 Microsoft
 mentioned


that
 their
 next
 year
 uh
 capex
 or
 or
 or


capix
 growth
 is
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 be


uh
 steeper.
 Um
 so
 uh
 the
 other
 thing
 is


obviously
 for
 them
 they
 are
 making
 money


off
 these
 solutions.
 So
 not
 just
 good


for
 for
 your
 chip
 players
 or
 your
 AI


infrastructure
 players.
 Uh
 but
 like
 we


saw
 I
 I
 think
 I
 even
 posted
 on
 on
 Google


on
 on
 X,
 Google's
 cloud's
 margin
 has


grown
 dramatically
 in
 just
 the
 past
 year


or
 so.
 So
 they're
 making
 actual
 return


on
 investments
 on
 these
 products.
 So


it's
 not
 like
 they're
 just
 burning
 the


money
 for
 nothing
 for
 for
 nothing,


right?
 So
 um
 I
 I
 think
 those
 are
 my
 top


raw
 thoughts.
 Uh
 some
 other
 cool
 things


they
 mentioned
 that
 in
 the
 future
 Whimo


they
 want
 to
 introduce
 uh
 Google
 and


Gemini
 into
 it.
 That's
 going
 to
 be


pretty
 fun.
 Um,
 imagine
 being
 in
 the


Whimo
 and
 saying,
 "Hey,
 I'm
 in
 this


city.
 Take
 me
 to
 a
 place
 where
 one
 of


the
 most
 viewed
 YouTube
 videos
 was
 at."


And
 I'll
 be
 like, "Oh,
 look.
 This
 is


where."
 So,
 so
 it's
 it's
 a
 great
 way
 to


kind
 of
 um


make
 I
 guess
 experiences
 and
 travel


experiences
 a
 little
 bit
 fun
 with
 both


the
 YouTube
 video
 um
 and
 that
 and
 maybe


on
 your
 way
 there
 you're
 watching
 the


YouTube
 video
 of
 it.
 Uh
 so
 YouTube
 can


create
 a
 massive
 ecosystem
 from
 robo


taxis
 from
 um
 YouTube
 itself
 and


implementing
 Gemini
 into
 it.


Yeah,
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 heard
 anything


bearish
 on
 Google.
 Cloud
 amazing


operating
 margins
 17
 to
 23.
 Um,
 Whimo


growth
 is
 incredible.
 First
 hundred


billion
 dollar
 quarter
 increased
 capex


so
 very
 important
 for
 all
 the


semiconductor
 names.
 And
 then
 I
 I
 think


the
 most
 important
 thing
 about
 this
 is


that
 search
 is
 not
 dead.


It's
 just
 not
 dead.
 It
 grew
 another
 12%


this
 year.
 So,
 it
 had
 a
 couple
 quarters


last
 year
 where
 it
 was
 looking
 like
 it


was
 weak,
 but
 the
 reality
 is
 search
 is


not
 going
 anywhere.
 And
 this
 thing
 wants


300.


Like,
 this
 thing
 wants
 300
 at
 this
 point


right
 now
 at
 292.
 The
 the
 I
 think
 the


most
 remarkable
 thing
 about
 Google
 is


the
 fact
 that
 it
 pumped
 over
 the
 past


couple
 months,
 then
 it
 pumped
 today
 in


the
 morning
 before,
 now
 pumping
 after


hours.
 A
 large
 cap
 like
 this
 doesn't
 do


that
 unless
 the
 street
 is
 so
 bullish


about
 what
 they're
 hearing.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 what
 we
 got
 on
 the
 call
 today.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 and
 I
 am
 shocked
 that


the
 other
 players
 are
 I
 thought
 last


time
 I
 checked
 Microsoft
 was
 down
 and
 um


Meta
 was
 down.
 Uh
 I
 think
 first
 with
 the


big
 beautiful
 bill
 um
 with
 Meta
 with


Meta.
 Um
 I
 think
 we
 might
 have
 some


analysts
 come
 out
 in
 the
 next
 few
 hours


or
 the
 next
 24
 hours
 kind
 of
 explaining


that
 look
 it's
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal


right
 now
 with
 what's
 happening
 on
 Meta.


Um,
 and
 then
 with
 Microsoft,
 again,
 we


didn't
 listen
 to
 the
 call.
 So,
 I'm


curious
 of
 why
 Microsoft
 might
 have
 been


down
 a
 bit,
 but
 maybe
 they
 were
 just
 a


little
 bit
 too
 priced
 to
 perfection,


especially
 after
 some
 of
 those
 recent


OpenAI
 news
 and
 everything
 else
 we're


seeing
 in
 the
 overall
 industry.
 But


long-term,
 very
 bullish
 in
 my
 opinion


for
 for
 the
 whole
 ecosystem
 and
 for
 the


whole
 market
 right
 now.
 Um,
 things
 are


looking
 good,
 I
 think.


>> Yeah.
 Two
 things
 on
 Microsoft.
 They
 took


a
 $3.5
 billion
 hit
 from
 OpenAI.
 So,


that's
 one
 thing.
 Number
 two
 is
 uh


Street
 wanted
 80.6
 six
 billion
 and
 they


came
 in
 at
 like
 80.1
 for
 guidance
 for


next
 quarter.
 So,
 they're
 going
 to
 beat


that
 number
 anyway,
 but
 it's
 like
 it


wasn't
 enough
 of
 a
 guidance
 beat
 against


the
 whisper
 numbers
 for
 Azure
 and
 that's


why
 it
 looks
 like
 it's
 selling
 off
 a


bit.
 But,
 I
 think
 the
 Microsoft
 dip
 is


stupid.
 The
 meta
 dip
 is
 really
 stupid.
 I


mean,
 like
 taking
 away
 180
 billion
 in


market
 cap
 for
 a
 15
 billion
 one-time
 tax


like
 they
 have
 to
 pay
 their
 taxes
 like


they
 got
 to
 pay
 their
 taxes,
 right?
 So,


taking
 this
 thing
 down
 is
 kind
 of
 dumb,


but
 I
 think
 it's
 giving
 a
 lot
 of
 people


a
 great
 opportunity
 to
 get
 into
 Meta.
 Uh


Meta
 is
 now
 trading
 at
 22
 times
 2026.


That's
 not
 really
 expensive
 at
 this


level.


>> Is
 Amazon
 moving
 on
 anything?
 I
 know


they
 report
 earnings
 tomorrow,
 but
 at


least
 we
 see
 that
 positive
 cloud
 um


market.
 I
 wonder
 how
 if
 the
 market
 is


now
 excited
 for
 Amazon
 after
 hours
 or


>> it's
 down
 1%.
 I
 think
 the
 market's
 still


waiting
 for
 the
 actual
 numbers
 that


we're
 going
 to
 get.
 Obviously,
 the


layoff
 news
 is
 important,
 but
 it
 doesn't


look
 like
 cloud
 from
 GCP
 or
 Azure
 was


bad.
 Maybe
 Azure
 wasn't
 as
 good
 as


expected
 even
 though
 they
 still
 beat
 EPS


by
 13%.
 Cloud
 was
 incredible
 from


Google,
 but
 nothing
 that
 would
 signal


unless
 Amazon's
 actually
 losing
 business


to
 those
 guys
 that
 Amazon
 should,
 you


know,
 not
 put
 up
 good.


>> And
 I
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 think
 that's
 the


case.
 I
 don't
 think
 anyone's
 losing


market,
 anybody's
 losing
 business
 to


them
 uh
 and
 anybody
 in
 this
 space


because
 we
 are
 constrained,
 right?
 If


you
 are
 constrained,
 you're
 going
 to
 be


going
 to
 the
 other
 player
 instead.
 Uh


you're
 not
 going
 to
 wait
 three
 months
 or


four
 months
 out
 if
 someone
 else
 can
 give


you
 the
 compute.
 Uh,
 so
 I
 don't
 I
 would


say
 at least
 for
 Amazon,
 I
 don't
 think


they're
 losing
 here
 in
 the
 uh
 AWS


market.
 Um,
 but
 to
 me,
 Amazon
 outside
 of


my
 top
 favorite,
 um,
 Amazon
 has
 become


one
 of
 my
 favorite
 Mac
 7s.
 Um,
 as
 I


think
 the
 market
 might
 be
 just


underappreciating
 the
 AWS
 growth
 it
 can


see
 in
 the
 upcoming
 year
 or
 so.


>> Yeah,
 this
 was
 massive
 across
 the
 board,


dude.
 This
 was
 massive
 across
 the
 board.


Yeah,
 Google's
 for
 PE
 continues
 to


remain
 reasonable.
 Uh,
 Sundar
 said,


"Cloud
 is
 extensive
 and
 reliable.
 Meta


outside
 of
 this
 tax
 thing,
 you
 know,


this
 probably
 wouldn't
 create
 that
 much


of
 an
 issue
 for
 I I
 didn't
 love
 Zuck's


answers
 on
 some
 of
 these
 questions,
 but


it
 was,
 you
 know,
 they
 didn't
 put
 up
 the


numbers
 where
 anyone
 should
 be


questioning
 the
 strategy.
 It's
 more
 so


just
 a
 question
 of
 this
 tax
 thing


leading
 to
 the
 gut
 reaction
 from
 the
 uh


from
 the
 from
 the
 ALOS."
 And
 then


Microsoft,
 there
 might
 be
 some
 things
 to


nitpick
 at,
 but
 like
 that's
 the
 thing.


You
 can
 nitpick
 at
 all
 these
 companies,


but
 they
 all
 crushed
 again.
 They
 all


increased
 capex
 again.
 And
 if
 Apple
 and


Amazon
 do
 what
 they
 need
 to
 do
 tomorrow,


it's
 a
 relatively
 likely
 successful
 Q3.


Trump's
 meeting
 Xi
 in
 a
 couple
 hours.
 He


just
 tweeted
 he's
 excited
 to
 meet
 him.


South
 Korea


>> South
 Korea's
 investing
 350
 billion.
 He


just
 tweeted.
 So
 I
 mean
 that
 like
 you


got
 a
 variety
 of
 good
 updates
 in
 regards


to
 the
 macro
 economy
 and
 these
 three


companies
 really
 did
 prove
 that
 they


need
 to
 do.


Yeah.
 And
 Tanner
 said,
 "Outside
 the


OpenAI


hit
 on
 Microsoft,


the
 combination
 of
 OpenAI's
 conversion


to
 a
 public
 benefit
 corporation,
 the


ongoing
 nature
 of
 our
 partnership
 will


result
 in
 increased
 volatility.


Therefore,
 going
 forward,
 we
 will


provide
 our
 outlook
 excluding
 any
 impact


from
 our
 investments
 in
 OpenAI.


That
 could
 also
 be
 why
 maybe
 some
 of
 the


estimates
 were
 a
 little
 bit
 lower,
 which


is
 reasonable
 for
 Microsoft
 to
 do.


>> And
 we
 got
 crazy.
 They
 own
 Yeah.
 And


they
 got
 so
 much
 ownership
 in
 in
 in
 Open


AI,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 if
 OpenAI
 just


continues
 to
 balloon
 in
 valuation,


eventually
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 worth
 more


than
 than
 Microsoft
 at
 these
 levels.
 So


then
 Microsoft
 itself
 just
 has
 that
 own


asset.
 That
 asset
 itself
 will
 be
 worth


more
 than
 the
 company
 with
 these
 current


numbers.
 But
 um
 yeah,
 overall
 I
 mean


>> last
 thing,
 what
 was
 your
 reaction
 to


Nvidia
 212?
 Like
 was
 that
 just
 crazy
 to


you
 or


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 uh


it's
 been
 just
 a
 fun
 day.
 I
 mean
 just


Nvidia
 in
 general
 keep
 killing
 it.
 Uh


keeps
 killing
 it.
 five
 trillion
 dollar


company.
 Uh
 I'm
 just
 looking
 at
 more


vacations
 to
 do
 throughout
 the
 uh


throughout
 the
 upcoming
 year
 hopefully.


>> Are
 you
 thinking
 of
 selling
 any
 here
 at


all
 or
 no?


>> No.
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 from
 from
 what
 we're


seeing
 in
 the
 market
 here,
 right?
 Um


we're
 still
 early
 innings.
 If
 you're


telling
 me
 Microsoft
 is
 telling
 me
 at


least
 for
 this
 fiscal
 year,
 um
 there's


still
 going
 to
 be
 compute
 constraint.
 Um


if
 you
 continue
 to
 see
 the
 innovations


in
 AI,
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 I
 I
 did
 a
 lot
 of


work.
 I
 don't
 know if
 I
 mentioned
 it


here
 uh
 but
 I
 was
 doing
 a
 lot
 of
 work


and
 AI
 saved
 me
 what
 I
 think
 would
 have


caught
 take
 took
 me
 weeks
 or
 months.
 If


I'm
 doing
 that
 I
 can't
 imagine
 what


other
 teams
 are
 doing.
 So
 um
 if
 I
 was
 to


sell
 in
 the
 AI
 market
 or
 AI
 sector
 would


be
 more
 of
 my
 yellow
 plays.
 Um
 but


definitely
 not
 Nvidia.
 This
 is
 a
 company


that's
 dominating
 in
 all
 angles.
 Um


maybe
 not
 the
 best
 return
 or
 opposed
 to


those
 yolo
 plays
 but
 it's
 all
 about
 that


risk-to-reward
 mentality.
 And
 to
 me,


Nvidia
 uh
 will
 still
 be
 my
 number
 one


position
 with
 no
 intentions
 of
 selling.


>> All
 right,
 there
 we
 go.
 Uh
 thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 with
 me
 for
 the
 uh


past
 nine
 hours.
 Appreciate
 it.
 It's


been
 a
 fun
 day.
 Jose,
 thanks
 for
 hopping


on.


>> Go
 get
 some
 sleep,
 man.


>> I
 need
 to
 go
 for
 a
 walk.
 Jose,
 there's


his
 YouTube
 right
 there.
 Uh
 BMR
 did
 not


have
 earnings
 today.
 I
 think
 it's
 next


week,
 so
 we'll
 talk
 about
 that.
 Trump
 is


meeting
 Xi
 at
 around
 10
 p.m.
 Eastern.
 in


a
 couple
 hours.
 If
 you're
 following
 on


X,
 I'll
 probably
 post
 some
 updates
 on


that.
 But
 we
 should
 see
 what
 uh
 what


they
 discuss
 and
 we'll
 probably
 get
 an


update
 from
 Trump
 and
 we'll
 be
 back


tomorrow
 on
 the
 market
 open
 and
 we'll


keep
 going
 from
 there.


All
 right.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 Thank
 you
 to
 all
 the
 mods


who
 were
 here
 for
 I
 think
 Tess
 was
 here


for
 nine.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 Tess
 was
 here


for
 nine
 hours,
 but
 I'm
 Benny
 June.
 Tess


Cactus
 Jack
 was
 our
 Bloomberg

 day.

 appreciate
 all
 you
 guys.

 good
