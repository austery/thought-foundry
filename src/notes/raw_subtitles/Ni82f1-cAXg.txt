Here are two metal
cylinders and a single drop of superglue.
Once it sets, you can literally hang
from that one drop of adhesive.
Oh my God.
That is crazy.
So how is superglue so strong?
Well, that's what I want to find out.
And along the way, we're going to learn
how it sets so quickly,
why it's so good at sticking to skin,
how it saves lives,
and how it might even help
solve our plastic pollution problem.
Plus, if it's so strong, one single
drop can easily lift over three tons.
Why is it weak in certain circumstances?
Mom is going to kill us.
*scream*
In 1942, the US was at war.
And to accelerate the production of gun
sights, the Eastman Kodak Company
was looking for a clear plastic
that could be cast
instead of grinding glass lenses.
Chemist Harry Coover was working on
a compound called cyanoacrylate.
It looked promising,
but it had the unfortunate tendency
to stick to everything it touched.
Coover called it a severe pain.
And as the war wound down,
Kodak gave up on finding
a plastic replacement and kept on making
gun sights out of glass.
By 1951,
Coover was again trying to develop a clear plastic.
This time for jet plane canopies.
If he could just solve the stickiness
problem, cyanoacrylate could work.
Coover showed the material to his coworker
Fred Joyner,
but gave him strict instructions.
I told him, look, don't take a refractive
index of this material.
If you do, you're going
to wreck the refractometer.
Cos it’s going to stick it together.
But after testing 909
other compounds, Joyner had forgotten.
So he prepped the 910 test by smearing
cyanoacrylate between two prisms.
After taking the measurement,
Joyner discovered
he couldn't pull the prisms apart.
He panicked.
The refractometer, worth nearly $10,000
adjusted for inflation, was ruined.
But instead of getting angry,
Coover had a flash of insight.
He got a sample of cyanoacrylate
and began gluing together
anything within reach. Glass
plates, rubber stoppers,
metal spatulas, wood, paper, in all different combinations.
He said “Everything stuck to everything
almost instantly and with bonds
I could not break apart.”
With this discovery, he dubbed the compound Eastman 910 Adhesive,
as it was the 910th substance
tested in the company's search.
But nowadays,
everyone calls this super glue.
So how does it work so quickly with
such strength on so many different things?
Bonds almost anything.
A plastic knob,
a plastic plug,  a rubber boot, a metal brooch,
a fishing rod, a cycle
grip, model planes and model
trains, a doorknob screw,
a flashlight case,
the broken trim on any car.
Super glue in the tube is a liquid of
identical monomer molecules.
The molecule is ethyl cyanoacrylate.
When you put it between two surfaces,
the liquid flows
into all the pores and crevices.
Then the monomers
start reacting with each other,
joining to form long polymer chains.
This turns the glue from a liquid into a solid,
and at this point it can no longer be
pulled out of the cracks and crevices,
so it's stuck in place
and the two surfaces are connected.
If you're ever trying to glue surfaces
that are too smooth,
this is probably the reason
super glue sticks poorly.
There are few crevices or pores for it
to cling to.
To fix this, you can sand the surfaces
to introduce some surface texture.
That way when the liquid glue solidifies,
it's stuck in the cracks.
But what triggers the monomers to solidify
instead of staying liquid
like they are in the tube?
Well, ethyl cyanoacrylate is primed to react
because it has two double bonds
and one triple bond close together.
What makes it
so reactive is you have a double bond
attached to a nitrile group
and an ester group.
And the unique part about
that is the chemistry of those groups
that make that double bond so electron deficient.
The oxygen and the nitrogen atoms
attract electrons more than the carbons.
So that leaves this carbon
slightly positively charged.
It is hungry. It is looking.
And anything
even slightly electronegative,
it will attack and it'll start a reaction.
In the presence of a negative ion,
the carbon double bond breaks
and four single bonds form.
But the nitrile and ester
groups are so electronegative they pull
the extra electron on across the molecule,
making this carbon negative. That invites
another slightly positive carbon
on a separate monomer to attack.
And now they're chemically linked
together.
The start of a polymer chain.
And once that goes
now it has the ability to go react
with all those other super glue
hungry monomers and rapidly polymerize.
It's a really, really chemically reactive
species.
That single initiator
started a chain reaction.
The next monomer again
pulls across the electron
and more and more monomers bond together,
forming longer and longer chains
until the super glue has solidified.
It normally takes between
10 and 30 seconds to set.
This was much faster than other adhesives
available in the 1950s.
A lot of glues like white
glue and glue sticks work by drying out,
so you have to wait for the water
to evaporate.
But with super glue it's
almost the opposite.
While I was prototyping snatoms, I 3D
printed these plastic shells
and super glued them together.
One day I was trying to open a bottle of
super glue where the cap had gotten
glued on to the nozzle,
so I tried twisting it off with my teeth,
but the bottle exploded,
filling my mouth with super glue.
And I was thinking, well,
I might have a few seconds to spit it out
with the saliva in my mouth before it set.
But the super glue actually hardened
immediately.
It stuck to my teeth and my tongue.
I had to get my now wife to pick it
out of my teeth with tweezers.
Luckily, it didn't glue together
anything essential.
I think it's
because it solidified so rapidly.
And the reason it did
that is because the polymerization
of super glue
is actually triggered by water.
Specifically, it's the slightly negative
oxygen atoms in the polar water molecule
and the negative hydroxide ions in water
that often break
open the carbon double bond,
initiating the formation of chains.
And water is everywhere.
I mean, there's moisture in the air,
little bits of water on most surfaces,
or absorbed into materials like fabrics.
That's why super glue sets rapidly
on almost every surface.
Each water molecule can initiate
the formation of a polymer chain.
There's a forensic technique
that uses super glue
fumes to pull fingerprints
from non-porous surfaces.
When you grab something,
your hand leaves behind moisture
and oils that are perfect
for super glue to bind with.
And this also makes
skin ideal to stick to.
There are a lot of wrinkles and pores
for super glue to seep into.
Plus, the protein collagen has a number
of negative regions that can initiate
the polymerization reaction
and bond directly with a monomer.
So your skin is the perfect sort
of surface for super glue to stick to.
And that's why it's so hard to get off.
Some of your molecules literally
become part of the polymer chain.
There's a medical case study where someone
got cyanoacrylate all over his hands.
So he quickly went to wash it off
with soap and water.
But that accelerated
the polymerization reaction,
and his hands were stuck together.
So he went to multiple medical
professionals, and he got terrible advice.
They tried alcohol, water and soap.
They also attempted physical separation.
And he went to consult cosmetic surgery.
But finally someone suggested acetone.
Acetone, or nail polish remover,
dissolved the glue and released his hands.
Now, unfortunately,
the bottles for some types of super glue
look incredibly similar
to those for eyedrops.
So there are hundreds of cases of people
putting super glue directly
into their eyes.
In that case, acetone is not the solution.
Don't try to separate
your eyelids, just seek medical attention.
Super glue is strong.
To demonstrate this and promote
his new product,
Coover went on a game show.
He showed that
with only a single drop of glue,
he could lift himself
and the host into the air.
Here we go. One drop of glue.
And after 24 hours,
it would support something
like 15,000 pounds.
One drop of glue.
Now, doctor,
you must be very proud of this.
I imagine many years of research
went into its discovery.
No, as a matter of fact,
it wasn't Gary.
This discovery was purely by accident.
Bully for you.
Super glue polymers are almost all single chains running linearly between the surfaces.
They have a directionality to them,
kind of like wood grain.
The chains are densely packed
with some cross-linking
between them,
and this makes the polymer fairly rigid.
It's about as hard as a hard hat.
This makes it strong in compression.
Under tension,
super glue is strongest when you pull
in the same direction as the chains.
The tensile strength of super glue
can be upwards of 25 mega pascals,
which is similar to other polymers,
meaning a square patch just five
centimeters on a side could suspend a
fully grown African elephant.
But super glue also has its weaknesses.
It is brittle,
so if there's a sudden impact,
it just kind of falls apart.
As a super glue is very quickly reacting.
It usually produces really short polymer
chains that have a matrix with built in stress.
Any time you have stress in a material,
it's a potential failure point.
The thing that makes it a really good
adhesive is kind of its Achilles heel.
in some cases. Polyethylene,
polypropylene,
nylons, like those squishy plastics.
Their polymer chains
and their chemistry
are such that they can absorb a lot of impact.
If a force comes
in, they'll kind of deform.
Whereas in the chains
of a super glue polymer,
it doesn't have the ability to do that.
So any impact will come and it'll
physically break those rigid bonds.
And it'll also kind of be absorbed
in those stress points, and it'll cause
the whole thing to fracture.
Super glue is also
weak if a force is applied perpendicular
to the polymer chains.
That is, it's weak in shear.
During this shear test,
the stress releases
breaking the super glue bond.
So shear is
kind of a combination of forces.
So you kind of have like a compression
and like a friction going on.
Tension is a pretty uni-directional force.
And the polymer
chains are able to deform enough.
However, in shear you have a more dynamic
set of forces going on.
And and they're just kind of breaking up
all at once.
Shear force doesn't get spread evenly.
It's highest
at the edges and lower in the middle.
And since super glue is so brittle,
it can't redistribute this stress,
causing the bond to fail.
It's even worse if you grab one
end of a surface and try to peel it back.
In that case,
all that force is on a few polymers,
so the chains break one by one
like a zipper unzipping.
Two long bars super glued together could be strong since there's a lot of surface area.
But if one end breaks,
the rest can easily peel off.
Now a bond breaking is bad, but
there are some materials that super glue
won't even stick to at all.
So here we have
a milk bottle,
and this is
made out of a plastic called polyethylene.
I'm going to put one drop right here.
But it's so weak
you can see the glue has made a perfect
little film
and it doesn't stick whatsoever.
The materials
that super glue does not bond to.
They fall in to category of materials
that are known as chemically inert.
And by inert
it just means that
they don't have reactive sites.
So super glue is so reactive
because it is so electron deficient.
It's looking for any source of electrons.
But you have a polypropylene
or a polyethylene or a Teflon.
And carbon loves carbon,
and carbon is not sharing its electrons.
So there's nothing on the surface
that is willing to donate any reactivity.
Even if you add initiators, say,
by spraying water, it still doesn't work.
That's because these materials
are hydrophobic and non-porous.
If you spray like,
a polypropylene sheet, with water
 it'll just fall off, right?
You know, if you can think of, like,
the beating up of water
on a hydrophobic surface.
So if you pour super glue on top of water,
it'll just like, you'll
just get like a clump of super glue on it.
And then you can just peel it off.
Most super glue specifically warns against
using it on polyethylene and polypropylene
because it won't stick.
But this is actually a good thing.
You have to have something that super glue
won't stick to, so it can be contained
and stored without setting.
Super glue quickly found industrial applications.
Its first sale was to Mason
and Hanger in 1956,
who used it to assemble atomic bombs.
Soon, different additives were devised
to change the properties
of pure ethyl cyanoacrylate.
The monomers by themselves are very runny,
almost like water,
so companies added thickening agents
like fumed silica to turn it into a gel.
Fumed silica forms branched structures
that increase viscosity.
Some acid is often added
to inhibit polymerization in the tube.
If you want to speed up the setting
of super glue, one way is to add
more negative ions, the initiators
that start the polymerization reaction.
You can buy accelerators specifically
for this purpose off the shelf,
but a number of DIYers and handymen
use baking soda - sodium bicarbonate.
It reacts with moisture in the air
to produce hydroxide ions.
So when you add super glue, it sets even
faster due to all those ion initiators.
Plus, it forms a really hard
composite substance.
You can layer super glue and baking soda
to strengthen a joint and fill gaps.
It can even be drilled or sanded
after setting.
It's interesting
to see how baking soda in solution
speeds up the polymerization of super glue.
If you take pure water
and pour in super glue, you get a bunch
of little plastic droplets.
The glue sets quickly, but not fast enough
to keep the whole stream connected. But
with baking soda dissolved in the water,
the super glue sets even faster.
This creates a continuous
length of polymer,
which is really cool to see,
but the resulting plastic is fragile
and can easily be crushed.
If you wanna glue things
underwater with superglue,
the key is actually to slow
the polymerization down.
With a gel cyanoacrylate, the
thickeners slow the reaction,
giving you enough time to
apply and detach objects.
- Wow, there it is: glued underwater.
It's not even a perfect fit.
I didn't put it together quite
right, but it’s still stuck.
- One day, Coover's eldest
son was making a model,
when he accidentally cut his finger.
As a quick-thinking and
experimentally-minded father,
Coover got some super glue
he brought home from the lab
and applied it to the cut.
It instantly sealed shut.
Coover immediately saw
its potential in medicine,
and he went to work.
He envisioned a glue that could
completely replace sutures.
But his team soon ran
into three key problems:
First, as super glue sets,
all those bonds forming release heat.
- This is a standard cotton ball.
Just gonna add some liquid super glue.
86. Oh my gosh, it's starting to smoke.
93, 99, 108.
Whoo, made my eyes water. 120.
If you do this at home, wear goggles,
and probably a respirator,
and probably do it outside.
I'm feeling it now. It
is hot, hot to the touch.
- The cotton has a lot of surface area,
and it's absorbed a lot of water,
so the superglue sets
even faster than usual
and releases all its heat at once.
If I get it on my skin,
the temperature increase
wouldn't be as dramatic,
but it's enough to irritate a wound.
The second problem is that over time,
super glue in the body breaks down,
and some of the things it breaks down into
are toxic chemicals like formaldehyde.
And finally, super glue is
hard and brittle, unlike us.
We are mostly just squishy
bags of meat and water.
So an adhesive for living
tissue needs to be soft
and flexible for the entire
duration of the healing process.
Remarkably, Coover and
his team found that all
of these problems could be solved
with a single change to the molecule:
Simply increase the number of
carbons in the alkyl chain.
With longer carbon
chains, it takes more time
for the monomers to bind together,
which slows down the rate of reaction.
This slows the rate of heat released,
so there's not a significant
temperature increase
all at once.
The longer polymers also
break down much more slowly,
so the wound has enough time to heal
before the glue starts
releasing toxins into the body.
It's removed before that happens.
And finally, since the reaction is slower,
there's more time for the
monomers to float around
and form longer polymers.
These longer polymers
can absorb stress better
than shorter chains,
meaning the glue can flex
more without breaking.
With the main problems addressed,
Coover submitted an
application to the FDA in 1964
for medical superglue.
The US military was very
interested in Coover's adhesive,
and they developed a
medical super glue spray
for use in the Vietnam War.
The spray saved lives.
In one case, a bullet hit
a 24-year-old soldier,
passing through his kidney and liver.
After part of his liver was removed,
they gave him 12 liters of blood.
That's enough to replace all the blood
in his body twice over.
But the bleeding just wouldn't stop.
By conventional methods, he was gone.
But then the surgeons sprayed superglue
directly on the liver.
The bleeding stopped, vital
signs returned to normal,
and the soldier recovered.
Despite its success on the battlefield,
medical superglue was held
up in bureaucratic red tape
for years, so long that Coover
had to abandon the project.
It wasn't until 1998 that he saw his dream
of a medical glue approved:
a 2-octyl cyanoacrylate called Dermabond.
Medical super glue has now grown
to be a $900-million-a-year industry.
In the 74 years since
Coover's accidental discovery,
cyanoacrylate has grown to
become a $3 billion industry.
But its impact doesn't stop there,
because now scientists are turning
to Coover's original research,
exploring its use as a plastic,
and it could well solve one
of the biggest problems the planet faces:
how to recycle the mountain of
plastic we produce each year.
Manufacturers can shred, melt,
and reform other plastics,
but the polymers degrade,
so the quality is worse
and the process generates microplastics.
- So you can only recycle mechanically
and thermally like that
a certain number of times
before you get a material
that's kind of useless.
It still will sit in the environment,
and it won't break down,
but it's not useful.
- [Derek] But superglue is unique.
If you heat it up to 210 degrees Celsius,
it'll break back down into pure monomers.
These can be distilled
and then reactivated
back into fresh polymer.
- We have a starting material, we
make it into a plastic,
and then, under a certain stimulus,
we can turn it back to
that starting material.
So let's see if we can
make a plastic from this,
you know, 'cause the goal
of a depolymerizable plastic
is that it's sustainable, right?
- There are just two problems:
First, how do you cast something
that sticks to basically everything?
And second, super glue
on its own is brittle,
so how do you stop it from breaking?
- The big problem is the handleability.
That was kind of the original problem.
They found that, okay,
this isn't a great plastic
because it sticks to everything.
That's how they discovered
that it was an excellent adhesive.
So we were faced with that same problem.
- But Coover didn't have the
modern plastics we have today.
Polypropylene, polyethylene,
and Teflon are so inert,
they don't activate superglue.
So they are the perfect
materials to handle the monomers.
- So we were able to actually handle it,
so that was, you know, a huge check.
We can actually work with this material.
- Next, to reduce brittleness,
you need super glue
to form long chains that tangle together.
And this problem can actually
be broken down into two parts.
First, a lot of initiators means lots
of short polymer chains.
Second, as the superglue sets,
the existing chains freeze
and they can't connect together.
There also might be some unused monomers
that can't get into the
right spot to attach.
If you can solve both these
issues, you get longer chains.
The first fix is to use a very weak base.
By mixing in a little
bit of this weak base,
there are enough initiators
to start the polymerization
reaction, but not too many,
so the polymer chains end up being longer.
- We use DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide,
which, in no other context,
would be used as an initiator,
but it was just electronegative
enough that we were able
to initiate a reaction
that could go slowly
and proceed in a way that
produced a nice solid plastic.
- [Derek] Next, you need a
solvent, in this case, acetone.
- And what a solvent is,
is it's just a medium that
dilutes the conditions.
It does not participate in the reaction.
Usually, it provides additional mobility.
- [Derek] After mixing the glue
and initiator into the acetone,
the mobile polymers are
able to form even longer,
more stable chains than usual.
And after a while, all the superglue sets,
the acetone evaporates, and
the new plastic is removed.
To reuse it, just heat it up
and distill it to get
back superglue monomers.
- So I would, on average, get around 93%,
which is excellent.
- [Derek] Compared to that,
even the most widely recycled plastics
can't return to the same quality,
and they can only be
downcycled once or twice
before ending up in landfill.
- I'm super glue's biggest fan, obviously,
but I hope that it can
actually have a real impact
in terms of sustainability
and kind of revolutionizing
how we look at plastics
and how we look at
materials that, you know,
we've existed with for decades.
You know, okay, what if we
use this for something else?
- Coover said it took the right
mindset to see cyanoacrylate
as a great adhesive.
The first time he worked with it,
he was thinking about gun sights
and nothing but gun sights.
Its sticky qualities were a pain.
The second time he encountered it,
his colleagues fixated on
the broken refractometer,
but he could finally see the quality
that frustrated him as a benefit.
And then, after decades of
researchers only viewing it
as a useful adhesive, it took
another flash of inspiration
to see its potential
as a plastic once more.
As Coover said, this should
serve as a reminder to all of us
to be open-minded and curious enough
to pursue unexplained events
and unexpected results,
which may unlock new secrets
and lead to new and exciting
discoveries of the future.
Coover's ability to look beyond roadblocks
and see the breakthroughs
on the other side is a skill
that every great innovator shares.
