a
 good
 investor
 combines
 passionate


curiosity
 with
 the
 Relentless
 Pursuit
 Of


Truth
 integrating
 a
 diverse
 sets
 of


information
 to
 gain
 unique
 insights


creatively
 connect
 unrelated
 data


continuously
 accumulating
 knowledge
 be
 a


learning


machine
 for
 me
 a
 safe
 and
 supportive


organizational
 culture
 is
 essential
 it


thrives
 on
 open
 disagreement


Collaborative
 Learning
 from
 failures
 and


successes
 and
 mutual
 care
 cultivating


this
 environment
 requires
 Collective


effort
 But
 ultimately
 elevates
 an


organization
 beyond
 the
 individuals


contributions
 for
 me
 a
 good
 investor
 is


someone
 who
 has
 a
 good
 strategy
 really


understands
 the
 market
 really


understands
 your
 portfolio
 why
 the
 stuff


you
 do
 makes
 sense
 and
 second
 is


execution
 how
 you
 step
 into
 positions


how
 you
 step
 out
 of
 positions
 how
 you


manage
 risks
 and
 drawdowns
 if
 you
 have


both
 of
 those
 a
 good
 strategy
 and
 sound


execution
 then
 you
 actually
 might
 be
 on


to


something
 a
 good
 investor
 need
 to
 be


confident
 enough
 to
 follow
 your


conviction
 and
 take
 contrarian
 bets


going
 against
 against
 Market
 consensus


because
 popular
 opinion
 is
 not
 always


correct
 however
 beware
 of
 your
 ego
 be


open
 and
 humble
 enough
 to
 change
 your


mind
 when
 new
 information
 appears


[Music]


[Music]

 how
 do
 you
 actually
 become
 a
 better


investor

and
 the
 behavioral
 aspects
 of
 excellent


investors
 and
 so
 it's
 time
 to
 kick
 it


off
 the
 first
 session
 on
 investment


philosophy
 and
 strategy
 with
 our
 first


Speaker
 of
 the
 today
 Greg

Founder
 not
 founder

 CIO


sorry
 of
 Bridgewater

 an
 excellent


investor

Poker
 so
 please
 join
 me
 in
 welcoming


Greg
 to
 the
 stage


[Music]


[Applause]


[Music]


well
 thank
 you
 uh
 for
 having
 me
 the
 so


when
 I
 think
 about
 our
 philosophy
 right


and
 this
 is
 really
 about
 the
 philosophy


that
 gets
 you
 to
 be
 excellent
 Excellence


is
 so
 core
 to
 us
 and
 as
 I
 go
 through
 the


different
 words
 that
 define
 our
 our
 um


our
 philosophy
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 trying


to
 really
 focus
 on
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 mean


by
 a
 buzzword
 like
 excellence
 and
 for
 us


we
 measure
 Excellence
 by
 what
 we
 mean
 by


it
 is
 continuous
 Improvement
 everybody


starts
 somewhere
 and
 the
 question
 is
 can


you
 as
 an
 individual
 and
 you
 as
 an


organization
 continuously
 improve
 that's


what
 we
 would
 Define
 as
 excellent
 and
 so


if
 I
 start
 with
 what
 um
 see
 if
 I
 got


this


here
 um
 what
 are
 we
 trying
 to
 be


excellent
 at
 and
 Bridgewater's
 been
 been


doing
 two
 things
 for
 its
 whole
 existence


50
 years
 I've
 been
 a
 bridge
 order
 for
 29


years
 and
 we
 focus
 on
 two
 things
 which


is
 to
 deeply
 understand
 how
 the
 economic


system
 works
 and
 apply
 that
 to
 build


great
 portfolios
 so
 we're
 trying
 as
 an


organization
 to
 be
 excellent
 at
 that


which
 means
 to
 continuously
 improve
 that


and
 there's
 three
 components
 that
 are


critical
 um
 to
 really
 understand
 our


philosophy
 one
 is
 what
 we
 mean
 by


fundamental
 so
 fundamental
 means
 what


actually
 drives
 markets
 that
 we
 believe


that
 you
 can
 that
 you
 can
 understand


this
 that
 there
 are
 decisions
 that


people
 make
 they
 make
 them
 for
 reasons


those
 reasons
 add
 up
 to
 what
 we
 consider


the


fundamentals
 that
 um
 that
 those
 ideas


can
 be
 you
 can
 think
 of
 them


qualitatively
 they're
 not
 like
 not


everything
 that
 you're
 thinking
 matters


is
 measurable
 in
 a
 traditional


qualitative
 sense
 but
 in
 any
 event


that's
 what
 we
 mean
 by
 fundamental
 which


is
 what
 are
 the
 true
 causes
 for
 the


things
 that
 you
 see
 in
 the
 world


and
 then
 the
 second
 step
 that
 we
 take
 is


to
 take
 whatever
 you
 believe
 and


systemize
 it
 what
 we
 mean
 by
 that
 is


have
 the
 rigor
 to
 take
 the
 reason
 that's


in
 your
 brain
 right
 it
 could
 be
 a


qualitative
 idea
 but
 there
 is
 a
 reason


the
 synapses
 in
 your
 brain
 are
 doing


what
 they're
 doing
 and
 somehow
 there
 are


inputs
 coming
 in
 there's
 logic
 being


applied
 to
 those
 inputs
 and
 outputs


coming
 out
 you
 can
 take
 the
 energy
 to


systemize
 that
 understanding
 and
 it's


critical
 I'll
 talk
 about
 why
 that
 for
 us


anyway
 that's
 so
 important
 and
 the
 last


thing
 is
 have
 a
 strategy
 for
 being
 wrong


our
 strategy
 for
 being
 wrong
 is


diversifying
 but
 there's
 different


strategies
 but
 you
 need
 to
 know
 that


whatever
 you
 believe
 with
 whatever


confidence
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 wrong
 a


tremendous
 amount
 so
 those
 are
 the
 three


kind
 of
 core
 things
 I'll
 dig
 a
 little


bit
 deeper


on
 so
 first
 off
 what
 could
 we
 mean
 by


fundamental
 what
 are
 truths
 that
 when
 we


try
 to
 discover
 what's
 true
 about


markets
 and
 economies
 there
 are
 things


that
 are
 going
 to
 be
 true
 now
 that
 are


true
 wherever
 you
 place
 yourself
 in
 the


world
 that
 are
 true
 at
 any
 moment
 in


history
 and
 we
 expect
 to
 be
 true
 at
 any


moment
 in
 the
 future
 me
 the
 first
 one
 of


those
 things
 we'd
 start
 with
 is
 that


there's
 two
 ways
 two
 core
 ways
 to
 make


money
 in


markets
 one
 is
 to
 take
 on
 risk
 that's
 a


risk
 transfer
 to
 you
 that
 somebody's


offering
 to
 pay
 you
 because
 you're
 in
 a


position
 to
 take
 risk
 they
 don't
 want
 to


take
 right
 that's
 what
 that
 General


category
 we
 call
 that
 beta
 not
 to
 be
 too


like
 there
 semantic
 arguments
 about
 what


beta
 means
 but
 for
 us
 we
 just
 mean
 the


the
 amount
 of
 money
 you
 get
 paid
 for


taking
 on
 somebody
 else's
 risk
 then


there's
 a
 separate
 point
 which
 is
 Alpha


which
 is
 the
 money
 you
 get
 you
 can
 make


by
 making
 smart
 decisions
 in
 terms
 of


timing
 in
 terms
 of
 valuation
 Etc
 that
 go


beyond
 just
 taking
 on
 the
 risk
 so
 that


we
 think
 about
 trying
 to
 separate
 that


and
 think
 of
 every
 um
 investment
 as
 the


risk
 neutral
 position
 plus
 the
 beta
 so


what
 the
 asset
 classes
 are
 that
 you
 hold


and
 the
 risk
 that
 you're
 transferring


Plus
 the
 alpha
 that's
 very
 different
 the


way
 we
 look
 at
 it
 that
 sort
 of
 formula


of
 how
 you
 get
 a
 total
 portfolio
 return


is
 different
 than
 how
 most
 organizations


structure
 their
 Investments
 most


organizations
 think
 of
 their
 Total


return
 as
 their
 their
 Holdings
 in
 each


asset
 class
 Holdings
 in
 stocks
 Holdings


in
 bonds
 Holdings
 in
 private
 Equity
 etc


etc
 and
 those
 sum
 up
 right
 and
 the


difference
 is
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 combine


your
 Alpha
 with
 your
 beta
 you
 can


separate
 those
 two
 decisions
 and
 that's


a
 big
 deal
 so
 first
 of
 understanding


those
 two
 return
 streams
 recognizing


they're
 different
 and
 the
 way
 you
 can


combine
 them
 together
 can
 actually


significantly
 improve
 how
 you


invest
 so
 now
 when
 we
 come
 back
 to


fundamentals
 and
 we
 think
 about
 what
 are


fundamentals
 that
 are
 Timeless
 and


Universal
 what
 can
 you
 say
 about
 markets


that's
 going
 to
 be
 true
 100
 years
 from


now
 it's
 true
 in
 China
 it's
 true
 in
 the


United
 States
 it's
 true
 here
 in
 Norway


um
 because
 you
 really
 want
 to
 base
 your


beliefs
 on
 things
 that
 are
 fundamentally


true
 and
 then
 build
 out
 the
 deep


understanding
 about
 those
 things
 so
 to


give
 you
 two
 examples
 of
 what
 we
 mean
 by


things
 that
 are
 Timeless
 and
 Universal


that
 the
 first
 is
 that
 the
 price
 of


anything
 is
 equal
 to
 the
 amount
 of


currency
 spent
 on
 it
 divided
 by
 its


quantity
 right
 that
 seems
 simple
 but


it's
 actually
 a
 world
 of
 understanding


to
 say
 well
 how
 much
 money
 is
 going
 to


be
 spent
 on
 something
 how
 much
 supply
 of


it
 exists
 right
 and
 you
 can


fundamentally
 build
 that
 you
 can
 build


that
 in
 any
 time
 in
 any
 country
 um
 and


I'll
 get
 into
 how
 we
 check
 that
 that


those
 things
 are
 true
 anywhere
 similarly


the
 price
 of
 something
 is
 equal
 to
 the


discounted
 economic
 conditions
 that


affect
 it
 and
 so
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


changes
 in
 prices
 it's
 because
 something


happens
 relative
 to
 the
 discounted


economic
 conditions
 in
 that
 asset
 those


two
 things
 are
 true
 all
 the
 time
 and


everywhere
 and
 those
 are
 big
 building


blocks
 to
 then
 build
 a
 process
 around
 so


when
 we've
 been
 building
 processes
 to


measure


that
 to
 measure
 those
 cause
 effect


linkages
 of
 things
 that
 we
 believe
 to
 be


true
 um
 you
 really
 starting
 in
 1980
 so


the
 first
 thing
 I'd
 say
 now
 would
 talk


about
 making
 decisions
 systematically


why
 do
 you
 do
 this
 it's
 so
 such
 a
 pain


right
 why
 do
 I
 have
 to
 write
 down
 what
 I


believe
 why
 do
 I
 have
 to
 stress
 test


whether
 it's
 true
 I
 mean
 most
 people


want
 to
 skip
 that
 step
 because
 it's
 like


okay
 it
 seems
 like
 this
 is
 going
 to


happen
 or
 that's
 going
 to
 happen
 and


it's
 been
 such
 a


huge
 uh
 building
 block
 in
 our


organization
 to
 say
 no
 we're
 going
 to


have
 the
 discipline
 to
 always
 write
 down


our
 reasoning
 right
 so
 when
 we
 talk


about
 making
 decisions
 systematically


this
 is
 not
 a
 quantitative
 thing
 this
 is


about
 having
 the
 discipline
 to
 say
 this


is
 why
 I'm
 doing
 what
 I'm
 doing
 that


opens
 up
 a
 world
 so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


yellow
 piece
 of
 paper
 that's
 up
 there


that
 was
 our
 1980
 Bond
 system
 so
 in


1980
 you
 can
 picture
 Bridgewater
 it
 was


yellow
 piece
 of
 paper
 rules
 that
 were


written
 out
 this
 is
 we're
 going
 to
 buy


bonds
 if
 this
 happens
 we're
 going
 to


sell
 bonds
 if
 that
 happens
 that
 were


rules
 about
 what
 thought
 about
 money


supply
 and
 other
 things
 at
 the
 time
 um


the
 idea
 itself


is
 not
 that
 useful
 but
 the
 process
 that


it
 kicked
 off
 was
 critical
 which
 is
 we


just
 scratched
 out
 one
 of
 those
 ideas


put
 in
 another
 one
 learned
 another
 one


but
 you
 start
 with
 this
 building
 block


of
 what
 do
 you
 believe
 so
 that
 others
 in


the


organization
 can
 question
 that
 it's


forcing
 you
 to
 actually
 State
 what
 your


logic
 is
 and
 um
 and
 that
 allows
 constant


compound
 Improvement
 that's
 really
 such


a
 critical
 element
 to
 our
 philosophy
 and


the
 and
 um
 the


benefit
 of
 that
 is
 you
 can
 check


yourself
 so
 what
 I'm
 showing
 here
 is


just
 an
 example
 if
 you
 if
 you
 said
 okay


let
 me
 say
 what
 I
 think
 right
 right
 now


you
 might
 think
 well
 the
 um
 capacity


utilization
 in
 the
 United
 States
 like


the
 economy
 is
 running
 hot
 and
 that


running
 hot
 could
 lead
 to
 um
 higher


wages
 and
 maybe
 higher
 inflation
 and


therefore
 I
 want
 to
 take
 this
 position


in
 markets
 right
 and
 the
 great
 thing


about
 forcing
 yourself
 to
 okay
 that


seems
 reasonable
 like
 let's
 write
 it


down
 let's
 see
 if
 that's
 true
 when
 is
 it


true
 if
 you
 use
 that
 rule
 will
 it


actually
 work
 in
 history
 right
 force


yourself
 through
 that
 put
 yourself
 at


different
 points
 in
 time
 that'll
 force


you
 to
 refine
 your
 thinking
 right
 if
 you


just
 take
 that
 idea
 that's
 like
 just


something
 i'
 you
 know
 recently
 heard
 a


fair
 amount
 so
 I
 just
 wrote
 it
 down
 so


it
 could
 show
 and
 then
 you
 could
 you


know
 have
 technology
 to
 just
 test
 okay


well
 let's
 say
 you
 follow
 that
 rule
 does


it
 work
 or
 not
 and
 what
 you
 find
 most
 of


the
 time
 is
 actually
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 it


doesn't
 work
 so
 now
 you
 think
 well
 I


must
 not
 know
 what
 I'm
 saying
 isn't
 that


reliable
 right
 and
 I
 show
 like
 a
 profit


curve
 of
 the
 alpha
 that
 rule
 and
 it's


actually
 okay
 for
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time


and
 then
 flat
 for
 the
 last
 35
 years
 why


would
 that
 be
 why
 is
 that
 getting
 priced


into
 markets
 what's
 going
 on
 right
 and


the
 benefit
 of
 writing
 down
 your
 rules


is
 you
 could
 actually
 see
 whether
 they


work
 um
 and
 that's
 a
 huge
 huge
 deal


beyond
 that
 you
 can
 also
 know
 what


you're
 in


for
 for
 every
 idea
 that
 we
 ever
 use
 to


invest
 we
 start
 with
 what
 do
 we
 expect


from
 it
 right
 and
 so
 this
 cone
 chart


illustrates
 this
 but
 every
 idea
 that
 we


use
 in
 investing
 we
 say
 okay
 what
 are


the
 risk
 and
 the
 return
 that
 we


expect
 from
 this
 idea
 in
 the


future
 and
 that
 gives
 us
 a
 uh
 an


opportunity
 to
 then
 compare
 what
 happens


relative
 to
 that
 right
 so
 the
 cone
 chart


is
 when
 we
 first
 started
 the
 idea
 so
 in


1991
 as
 an
 example
 we
 started
 the
 idea


of
 of
 pure
 Alpha
 which
 is
 all
 of
 the


alpha
 ideas
 we
 had
 at
 the
 time
 put


together
 and
 then
 we've
 added
 to
 them


and
 subtracted
 from
 them
 but
 um
 and
 we


set
 out
 a
 con
 chart
 and
 said
 this
 is


what
 we
 expect
 the
 risk
 return
 to
 look


like
 into
 the
 future
 and
 every
 day
 we


Mark
 what's
 happening
 relative
 to
 that


expectation
 right
 and
 we
 do
 that
 with


every
 single
 idea
 which
 is
 automatic


quality
 control
 you
 could
 say
 okay
 if
 my


idea
 doesn't
 work
 out
 consistent
 with


how
 I
 expected
 it
 to
 then
 okay
 the


world's
 different
 than
 what
 I
 thought


and
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 if
 there
 are
 draw


Downs
 in
 that
 idea
 which
 there
 always


will
 be
 you
 plan
 for
 it
 in
 advance


you're
 not
 reacting
 to
 that
 draw
 down


you're
 saying
 okay
 if
 I
 have
 a
 draw
 down


of
 this
 nature
 I'm
 not
 perplexed
 by
 it


because
 I
 knew
 it
 would
 happen
 I


expected
 that
 to
 happen
 um
 so
 knowing


what's
 inside
 the
 bounds
 of
 what
 you


expect
 and
 what's
 not
 is
 another


critical


element
 now
 the
 next
 point
 is
 probably


the
 one
 that's
 most
 sort
 of
 Under
 Fire


at
 this
 point
 in
 history
 because


diversification
 hasn't
 been
 doing
 that


great
 as
 a
 concept
 but
 but
 um
 if
 we


thought
 about
 the
 Holy
 Grail
 of


investing
 right
 what
 do
 we
 actually
 want


if
 you
 want
 to
 achieve
 your
 goals
 in


investing
 um
 it's
 to
 have
 something
 like


15
 to
 20
 uncorrelated
 return
 streams


this
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 we're
 seeking
 you


never
 actually
 get
 there
 because
 things


are
 too
 correlated
 to
 quite
 get
 to
 that


level
 but
 if
 you
 you're
 seeking
 ways


that
 you
 can
 make
 money
 in
 markets
 that


are
 unrelated
 right
 and
 and
 the
 benefit


of
 that
 is
 you
 can
 translate
 if
 you


basically
 look
 at
 this
 chart
 most
 things


if
 you
 take
 most
 of
 the
 Investments
 that


you
 you're
 all
 invested
 in
 are


reasonably
 highly
 correlated
 they're
 on


the
 top
 left
 that
 means
 you
 can
 buy
 a


whole
 bunch
 of
 them
 you're
 not
 actually


getting
 much
 diversification
 if
 you
 see


this
 curve
 if
 you're
 able
 to
 select


strategies
 that
 are
 uncorrelated
 and
 you


can
 move
 down
 that
 curve
 you
 can
 improve


your
 reliability
 3
 five
 x
 with
 equally


good
 ideas
 if
 you're
 getting


uncorrelated
 ones
 um
 so
 that
 is
 really


that
 seeking
 that
 search
 for
 what
 are


our
 paths
 to
 get
 positively
 expected


returns
 that
 are
 um
 uncorrelated
 to
 each


other
 so
 that's
 again
 a
 hugely
 important


part
 of
 our


philosophy
 and
 to
 do


that
 what
 you
 need
 is
 to
 to
 put
 them


together
 in
 a
 way
 that
 actually
 works
 so


when
 you
 do
 balancing
 and
 diversifying


in
 terms
 of


risk
 instead
 of
 in
 Terms
 of
 capital
 is


so
 critical
 so
 it's
 usually
 people
 think


in
 terms
 of
 okay
 I'm
 going
 to
 invest
 X


in
 this
 asset
 Y
 in
 this
 asset
 Etc
 in


capital


terms
 restructuring
 your
 thinking
 to


think
 in
 terms
 of
 I'm
 going
 to
 allocate


risk
 to
 different
 things
 and
 then
 I'm


going
 to
 try
 to
 balance
 that
 risk
 among


things
 that
 are
 diversifying
 so
 that


means
 you
 have
 to
 take
 high
 risk


strategies
 and
 lower
 the
 risk
 on
 them


and
 take
 low
 risk
 strategies
 and
 raise


the
 risk
 on
 them
 in
 order
 to
 get


diversification
 across
 them
 right
 and


that's
 a
 another
 attribute
 of
 when
 we're


thinking
 about


diversifying
 now
 to
 slow
 down
 a


second


um
 just
 to
 put
 that
 into
 practice
 right


so
 when
 you
 think
 about
 the


concepts
 that
 are
 behind
 pure


Alpha
 that
 is
 sort
 of
 the
 the
 best
 we


could
 do
 in
 generating
 Alpha
 in
 the


world
 the
 concepts
 start
 with
 the
 deep


understanding
 of
 the
 world
 having


studied
 everything
 that
 exists
 in
 the


world
 that
 we
 could
 think
 of
 for
 50


years
 taking
 that
 yellow
 piece
 of
 paper


Crossing
 out
 things
 we
 don't
 like
 adding


things
 we
 learn
 building
 those
 into


algorithms
 that
 reflect
 everything
 that


we've
 ever
 thought
 of
 right
 this
 kind
 of


gives
 you
 a
 sense
 of
 how
 that
 literally


works
 so
 it
 starts
 with
 different
 ideas


on
 the
 left
 here
 that
 a
 you'll
 have


different
 approaches
 to
 trading
 the


market
 this
 is
 Again
 part
 of


diversifying
 right
 you
 might
 think
 in


terms
 of
 fundamental
 principle
 of
 value


that
 eventually
 that
 that
 the
 cash
 flow


of
 an
 asset
 is
 going
 to
 equal


the
 the
 present
 value
 of
 all
 the
 future


returns
 that
 you'll
 get
 you
 could
 make


build
 that
 deep
 understanding
 of
 what


causes
 that
 what
 what
 an
 asset
 should
 be


worth
 today
 right
 that
 could
 be
 one


perspective
 on
 that
 market
 that
 isn't


going
 to
 help
 you
 that
 much
 in
 the
 next


six
 18
 months
 it
 helps
 to
 some
 degree
 it


won't
 help
 you
 that
 much
 so
 you
 need


other
 perspectives
 well
 what
 are
 the


other
 drivers
 Beyond
 value
 right
 we


think
 of
 the
 essentially
 the
 movement
 in


the
 fundamental
 conditions
 that
 matter


so
 how
 do
 you
 measure
 those
 how
 do
 you


build
 that
 into
 a
 decision
 role
 we
 also


think
 about
 the
 effect
 that
 other


markets
 have


on
 that
 particular
 Market
 again
 how
 do


you
 build
 that
 whole
 world
 out
 how
 why


do
 other
 markets
 affect
 this
 Market
 how


does
 that
 actually
 work
 and
 then
 the


fourth
 thing
 is
 who
 all
 the
 buyers
 and


sellers
 are
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 things
 go


far
 from
 fair


value
 is
 because
 buyers
 and
 sellers
 do


things
 for
 reasons
 other
 than
 the


long-term
 cash
 flow
 effect
 and


understanding
 the
 balance
 sheets
 of


those
 players
 where
 they
 get
 their
 money


from
 how
 that
 works
 those
 pieces
 all


combined
 together
 and
 you
 can
 think
 of


it
 as
 we
 have
 all
 of
 those
 ideas
 that


we've
 been
 working
 on
 for
 years
 you
 can


think
 of
 it
 as
 four
 people
 arguing
 with


each
 other
 with
 different
 perspectives


on
 markets
 that
 you
 then
 put
 together
 to


get
 to
 a
 view
 in
 a
 market
 which
 is
 kind


of
 then
 the
 thing
 that's
 on
 the
 second


the
 the
 next
 diagram
 here
 on
 the
 chart


which
 is
 okay
 you
 can
 translate
 those


different


people's
 views
 into
 a
 systematic
 process


those
 build
 that
 systematic
 process
 to


combine
 that
 information
 into
 one
 view


of
 a


market
 right
 so
 that
 we
 take
 that
 second


step
 then
 we
 take
 those
 signals
 that


we've
 combined
 together
 and
 build
 that


into
 a
 RIS
 pie
 so
 say
 okay
 well
 how
 much


risk
 do
 we
 want
 to
 put
 on
 each
 one
 of


those
 strategies
 how
 much
 risk
 would
 we


put
 in
 each
 one
 of
 the
 markets
 again


trying
 to
 move
 ourselves
 as
 much
 as


possible
 to
 the
 Holy
 Grail
 of
 15
 or
 20


uncorrelated
 return


streams
 and
 um
 that's
 then
 the
 pie
 chart


shows
 the
 risk
 budget
 we
 try
 to
 get
 over


time
 which
 is
 a
 very
 balanced
 risk


budget
 across
 many
 different
 markets


across
 very
 many
 different
 strategies


across
 those
 markets
 but
 at
 a
 point
 in


time
 which
 is
 then
 the
 furthest
 right


chart
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 views
 on


everything
 that's
 another
 big
 important


philosophical
 thing
 is
 you
 don't
 have
 to


have
 a
 view
 on
 everything
 you
 have
 this


world
 of
 opportunities
 to
 take
 advantage


of
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 have
 a
 view
 on


everything
 so
 translating
 your
 views
 at


a
 point
 in
 time
 that
 things
 that
 you


have
 strong
 views
 on
 through
 a
 risk


budget
 that's
 at
 a
 crosstime
 risk
 budget


you
 can
 sort
 of
 multiply
 the
 signal
 by


the
 risk
 budget
 to
 get
 the
 overall


portfolio
 that
 you
 end
 up
 with
 um
 so


that's
 how
 we
 kind
 of
 put
 these
 pieces


together
 in
 an
 approach
 that
 starts
 with


qualitative
 thinking
 about
 from
 experts


on
 like
 why
 would
 you
 buy
 a
 bond
 why


would
 you
 buy
 a
 currency
 etc
 etc


Translating
 that
 quality
 qualitative


thinking
 interrogating
 it
 until
 you
 can


translate
 it
 into
 an


algorithm
 using
 those
 algorithms
 to
 look


everywhere
 in
 the
 world
 so
 you
 can
 be


massively
 Diversified
 because
 now
 you
 if


you've
 actually
 taken
 the
 logic
 why


would
 you
 buy
 a
 bond
 why
 would
 you
 buy
 a


currency
 you
 could
 apply
 that
 anywhere


in
 the
 world
 if
 you've
 done
 it
 well
 and


deeply
 you
 can
 apply
 it
 everywhere
 so


you
 can
 apply
 those
 rules
 while
 you're


not
 even
 realizing
 something's
 happening


in
 a
 country
 or
 whatever
 and
 um
 you


could
 build
 up
 your
 Port
 build
 out
 a


portfolio
 that
 way
 measuring
 point
 in


time
 conditions
 reflecting
 all
 that


logic
 that
 you've
 built
 up
 over
 50
 years


of
 compounding
 right
 and
 that's
 kind
 of


the
 last
 point
 that
 I'd
 say
 if
 you
 just


talk
 about
 our
 philosophy
 it
 starts
 with


constant
 Improvement


and
 if
 you
 actually
 do
 constant


Improvement
 as
 an
 organization
 and
 you


compound
 compound
 that
 understanding


right
 you
 think
 about
 compound
 returns


in
 the
 context
 of
 an
 investment
 if
 you


think
 of
 it
 in
 terms
 of
 an


organization
 what
 you
 really
 want
 to
 do


is
 compound
 understanding
 like
 what
 does


the
 organization
 actually
 know
 and
 how


do
 you
 keep
 building
 that
 out
 right
 and


so
 this
 diagram
 on
 the
 left
 it's
 going


to
 be
 a
 little
 hard
 to
 to
 say
 but


basically
 this
 is
 my
 view
 of
 the
 three


pieces
 that
 we've
 been
 doing
 to
 build


out
 our
 understanding
 that
 allows
 us
 to


compound
 as
 an


organization
 the
 first
 is
 what's


reflected
 by
 that
 Cube
 which
 is
 that


everything
 we've
 ever
 learned
 at


Bridgewater
 that
 we
 thought
 has


value
 we
 have
 translated
 that
 into
 an


algorithm
 we
 that
 it's
 it
 is
 that


algorithm
 itself
 is
 data
 that's
 been


stored
 everything
 we've
 ever
 learned


about
 currencies
 bonds
 economies
 growth


inflation
 everything's
 been
 learned


everything
 is
 stored
 in
 a
 way
 that's


organized
 such
 that
 you
 can
 find
 it
 you


can
 utilize
 it
 others
 can
 build
 upon
 it


we
 make
 everything
 that
 we've
 done
 we


have
 the
 standard
 of
 it
 has
 to
 be


computer
 readable
 which
 means
 we
 run
 it


three
 times
 a
 day
 it's
 always
 updated


it's
 always
 got
 the
 newest
 information


and
 human
 readable
 which
 means
 that
 a


human
 expert
 can
 look
 at
 this
 and


understand
 investor
 can
 see
 this
 it's


not
 buried
 in
 code
 but
 that
 it's


available
 everything
 that
 we've
 ever


learned
 that's
 what
 the
 cube
 represents


now
 to
 have
 an
 organization
 of
 hundreds


of
 people
 working
 on
 that
 Cube
 you
 need


what
 the
 pyramid
 represents
 which
 is


well
 how
 do
 you
 do
 it
 when
 you
 learn


something
 where
 do
 you
 put
 it
 how
 do
 you


reflect
 your
 qualitative
 understanding


in
 ways
 that
 then
 others
 can
 access


right
 so
 the
 pyramid
 and
 what
 we
 have
 in


there
 is
 essentially
 our
 rule
 book
 of


how
 you
 go
 about
 from
 an
 idea
 to
 getting


the
 data
 you
 need
 to
 fuel
 the
 idea
 to


building
 the
 visualization
 that
 other


people
 need
 to
 understand
 your
 idea


right
 and
 so
 that
 is
 the
 second


component
 of
 it
 and
 then
 the
 third


component
 of
 it
 is
 the
 circle
 around
 it


which
 is
 reflects
 the
 learning
 process


the
 constant
 learning
 process
 you'll


always
 be
 wrong
 about
 a
 ton
 we
 have
 two


inputs
 into
 our
 process
 one
 is
 the
 basic


Circle
 which
 is
 we're
 constantly
 making


predictions
 about
 the
 world
 we're


constantly
 getting
 them
 wrong
 we're


constantly
 learning
 by
 digesting
 why


that
 happened
 looking
 back
 and
 building


that
 out


then
 um
 there's
 also
 inputs
 in
 the
 world


something
 you've
 never
 thought
 of
 before


new
 things
 happening
 right
 and
 the
 great


thing
 about
 having
 a
 systematic
 process


is
 you
 could
 spend
 all
 your
 time
 on
 what


you
 might
 be
 missing
 in
 that
 systematic


process
 how
 do
 you
 deal
 with


geopolitical
 tensions
 and
 tariffs
 and


and
 changes
 in
 trade
 patterns
 Etc
 you


might
 not
 have
 that
 in
 your
 process
 but


if
 you
 have
 a
 process
 that
 reflects


everything
 you
 think
 about
 you
 can
 spend


all
 your
 effort
 on
 the
 new
 problems


right
 and
 the
 chart
 on
 the
 right
 is
 kind


of
 what
 I
 want
 to
 leave
 you
 with
 the
 um


it's
 the
 compounding
 point
 that
 if
 you


start
 this
 is
 true
 of
 Investments


obviously
 but
 true
 in
 an
 organization


and
 understanding
 if
 you
 start
 with
 a


basic
 level
 of
 understanding
 in
 1980
 on


a
 piece
 of
 paper
 and
 you
 keep
 Crossing


things
 out
 and
 learning
 and
 learning
 and


learning
 and
 that
 is
 that
 thing
 is
 not


in
 your
 head
 so
 it
 doesn't
 leave
 when


you
 leave
 but
 it's
 actually
 reflected
 in


that
 process
 that
 others
 can
 build
 on


your
 understanding
 follows
 a
 compound


return
 curve
 as
 an
 organization
 the
 same


way
 way
 that
 you're
 an
 investment
 can
 if


you
 continue
 to
 compound
 so
 that's
 our


[Applause]


philosophy
 thanks
 Greg
 for
 sharing
 your


insights
 we
 really
 enjoy


that
 our
 next
 speaker
 for
 today
 is


Harvard
 marks
 from
 okre
 Capital


Management


now
 Havard
 has
 a
 passion
 for
 contrarian


investing
 he's
 not
 only
 a
 world-renowned


investor
 but
 also
 an
 art
 Enthusiast
 and


an
 author
 we're
 really
 lucky
 to
 have
 you


in
 person
 with
 us
 today
 Howard
 would
 you


like
 to
 join
 me
 on
 the


[Applause]


[Music]


[Applause]


stage
 to
 wait
 there
 he
 is
 his
 hand
 went


down
 I
 want
 to
 thank
 Greg
 for
 sharing


his
 knowledge
 with
 us
 today
 and
 Nikolai


and
 nbm
 for
 hosting
 us
 today
 and
 when
 I


was
 offered
 the
 chance
 to
 discuss


investment
 philosophy
 I
 said
 there's
 no


way
 I'd
 rather
 spend
 my


birthday
 I'm
 extremely
 interested
 in


investment
 philosophy
 uh
 I
 think
 it
 has


to
 undergird
 everything
 we
 do
 my


argument
 is
 that
 our
 Behavior
 has
 to
 be


uh
 well
 thought
 out
 and
 intentional
 uh


and
 so
 our
 methodology
 has
 to
 be
 as
 well


um
 and
 um
 uh
 you'll
 hear
 that
 it's


different
 but
 at
 least
 we
 have
 thought


it
 out
 and
 it
 is
 intentional


um
 it
 starts
 with
 uh
 a
 conscious


decision
 as
 to
 what
 you
 want
 to


accomplish
 now
 this
 may
 sound
 easy
 well


we
 want
 to
 have
 more
 money
 rather
 than


less
 we
 want
 to
 have
 a
 higher
 return


rather
 than
 less
 uh
 but
 the
 the
 starting


question
 for
 any
 organization
 in


investing
 should


be
 will
 we
 will
 we
 settle
 for
 average
 or


do
 we
 want
 to
 try
 to
 be
 above
 average


now
 that
 sounds
 like
 an
 easy
 one
 but
 you


have
 to
 recognize
 that
 investing
 it's


extremely
 easy
 to
 be
 average
 you
 can
 buy


off-the-shelf
 products
 that
 will


guarantee
 you
 that
 you'll
 do
 average
 or


you
 can
 try
 to
 be
 above
 average
 which
 is


extremely
 difficult
 and
 there
 is
 no


shorefire
 uh
 solution
 to
 how
 to
 get


there
 and
 if
 you
 try
 to
 be
 above
 average


it
 exposes
 you
 to
 the
 risk
 of
 being


below
 average
 the
 two
 are
 inseparable
 so


thoughtfully
 consciously
 intentionally


which
 is
 it
 for
 you
 and
 your


organization
 uh
 next
 um
 you
 I
 believe


that
 an
 organization
 has
 to
 have
 a
 Creed


a
 religion
 the
 things
 it
 believes
 in
 the


things
 it
 doesn't
 believe
 in
 the
 things


it
 will
 do
 the
 things
 it
 won't
 do


because
 it
 doesn't
 trust
 them
 and
 you


have
 to
 stick
 to
 it
 and
 uh
 again
 it
 has


to
 be
 conscious
 and
 intentional
 now
 I


wish
 the
 print
 was
 bigger
 so
 I
 could
 see


it
 I
 uh
 I
 could
 probably
 see
 it
 if
 I
 do


a
 little
 bit
 of
 this
 but
 um
 but
 the


truth
 is
 we
 have
 to
 make
 decisions
 what


will
 be
 our
 intention
 what
 do
 we
 believe


in
 will
 we
 trust
 macro
 forecasting
 or


will
 we
 uh
 abstain
 from
 it
 will
 we


um
 pardon
 me
 uh
 uh
 how
 do
 you
 think


about
 risk
 will
 you
 take
 a
 high-risk


approach
 or
 a
 lowrisk
 approach
 which
 is


your
 route
 uh
 to
 uh
 success
 it
 it's
 not


the
 same
 for
 everybody
 um
 do
 you
 believe


in
 the
 efficient
 market
 this
 is
 Extreme


important
 it's
 uh
 the
 most
 important


concept
 I
 took
 away
 from
 my
 uh
 graduate


uh
 education
 at
 the
 University
 of


Chicago
 in
 the
 late
 60s
 um
 uh
 many


people
 understand
 the
 concept
 very
 few


people
 incorporate
 it
 and
 think
 about
 it


in
 their
 daily
 lives
 these
 are
 some
 of


the
 things
 that
 we
 have
 to
 consider
 so


let's
 talk
 first
 about
 the
 concept
 of


market
 efficiency
 now
 uh
 the
 the
 theory


of
 market
 efficiency
 is
 that
 there
 are
 a


lot
 of
 people
 out
 there
 and
 they're
 all


numerate
 intelligent
 highly
 motivated


objective
 and
 rational
 and
 they
 all
 want


to
 accomplish
 the
 thing
 you
 do
 which
 is


to
 end
 up
 with
 more
 money
 than
 you


started


with
 given
 the
 scope
 of


competition
 how
 will
 you
 be
 the
 one
 who


accomplishes
 the
 goal
 rather
 than
 them


not
 easily
 uh
 thought
 out
 um
 now
 the
 the


uh
 what
 we
 call
 the
 uh
 strong
 form
 of


the
 efficient
 market
 hypothesis
 says


that
 due
 to
 these


circumstances
 all
 information
 is


immediately
 incorporated
 into
 the
 price


of


assets
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 no
 one
 person


can
 figure
 out
 uh
 which
 are
 the
 bargains


and
 which
 are
 the


overpricing
 now
 the
 the
 really
 strong


form
 is
 actually
 a
 little
 different
 it


says
 that
 the
 prices
 of
 assets
 as
 a


result
 of
 this
 intensive
 uh
 process
 are


always
 right
 you
 can't
 beat
 them
 and
 so


you
 can't
 beat
 the
 market
 now
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 right
 I
 think
 the
 prices


are
 not
 necessarily
 right
 they're
 just


the
 best
 that
 the
 consensus
 can
 do
 and


it's
 hard
 for
 any
 one
 person
 to
 be


smarter
 than
 the
 consensus
 consistently


two
 different
 things
 but
 the
 um
 but
 the


bottom
 line
 on
 both
 is
 the
 same
 you


can't
 beat
 the
 market
 so
 the
 question
 is


do
 you
 accept
 that
 and
 that
 that
 pushes


you
 toward
 a
 passive
 approach
 targeting


uh
 average
 performance
 low
 cost
 low
 risk


highly
 likely
 to
 succeed
 to
 approach
 to


to
 accomplish
 your
 objective
 which
 is


being
 average
 or
 will
 you
 try
 to
 be


above
 average
 in
 the
 face
 of
 the
 very


strong
 competition
 that
 exists
 will
 you


endure
 the
 costs
 will
 your
 pursuit
 of


being
 above
 average
 uh
 permit
 you
 to
 be


exposed
 to
 the
 risk
 of
 being
 below


average
 and
 will
 you
 engage
 in
 this


pursuit
 of
 superior
 performance
 uh
 which


is
 not
 that
 likely
 to
 succeed
 U
 you
 know


the
 first
 thing
 I
 learned
 at
 University


of
 Chicago
 was
 that
 on
 average
 most


people
 do


average
 before
 fees
 and
 below
 average


astrop
 fees
 and
 the
 thought
 at
 the
 time


1968
 was
 well
 why
 don't
 they
 just
 buy


one
 share
 of
 every
 stock
 in
 the
 S&P
 500


there
 was
 no
 discussion
 of
 index
 funds


or
 indexation
 these
 had
 yet
 to
 be


invented
 Jack
 basically
 by
 Jack
 Bogel
 at


Vanguard
 in
 74
 but
 you
 can
 see
 where
 the


concept
 went
 and
 uh
 today
 most
 uh
 mutual


fund
 Equity
 capital
 is
 managed
 passively


or
 through
 indexation
 so
 it
 it
 was
 not


irrelevant
 it
 was


persuasive
 will
 you
 try
 to
 be
 active


and
 be
 above
 average
 or
 passive
 and
 be


average
 do
 you
 uh
 have
 the
 uh
 people
 in


hand
 who
 can
 accomplish
 it
 or
 the


ability
 to
 find
 those
 people
 and
 and


hire
 them
 as
 outside
 managers
 um


uh
 what
 happens
 uh
 at
 the
 moment
 when
 uh


you
 know


uh
 average
 performance
 is
 X
 and
 a
 few


people
 publish
 performance
 which
 is
 much


better
 and
 your
 bosses
 say
 who's
 the


idiot
 who
 signed
 on
 for
 average


performance
 um
 so
 these
 are


questions
 but
 it's
 very
 fundamental
 to


the
 selection
 of
 an
 investment
 approach


to
 understand
 and
 reflect
 the
 concept
 of


market


efficiency
 the
 next
 is
 coming
 where
 is


knowing
 where
 uh
 Returns
 come


from
 um
 you
 can
 have
 an
 average


portfolio
 and
 do
 average
 or
 you
 can
 say


well
 this
 is
 is
 a
 company
 that
 I
 think


is
 going
 to
 deliver
 positive
 news
 which


is
 unanticipated
 by
 others
 positive


surprises
 and
 if
 you
 can
 uh
 figure
 out


which
 ones
 will
 deliver
 positive


surprises
 you
 can
 overweight
 your


portfolio
 uh
 toward
 those
 and
 then
 when


the
 news
 comes
 out
 and
 it
 conforms
 with


your
 view
 uh
 everybody
 else
 says
 oh
 I


wish
 I
 had
 more
 they
 go
 out
 and
 buy
 it


that
 forces
 the
 price
 up
 you
 are
 an


above
 average
 performer


so
 that's
 the
 root
 how
 uh
 regularly
 can


it
 be
 accomplished
 that's
 the
 question


if
 you
 think
 different
 from
 others
 you


have
 what
 we
 call
 a
 deviant
 perception


deviant


perception
 how
 often
 will
 you
 be
 right


as
 opposed
 to
 the
 consensus
 being
 right


and
 you
 being
 wrong
 um
 uh
 this
 is
 uh
 at


the
 heart
 of
 things
 again
 you're
 up


against
 int


competition
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 when
 I


started
 my
 career
 at
 a
 large
 and


bureaucratic
 institution
 uh
 in
 the


equity
 Department
 people
 would
 ask
 well


what
 do
 you
 think
 you
 can
 make
 for
 us


and
 the
 answer
 was


12%
 well
 how
 do
 you
 arrive
 at
 12
 well


the
 S&P
 500
 does
 10
 on
 average
 has
 done


at
 that
 point
 in
 time
 for
 60
 years
 so
 if


you
 can
 get
 10
 without
 any
 effort
 you


should
 be
 able
 to
 get
 well
 let's
 say
 two


20%
 %
 better
 with
 a
 little
 elbow
 grease


in
 other
 words
 12
 but
 what
 if
 all
 the


elbow
 grease
 in
 the
 world
 doesn't


accomplish
 anything
 because
 the
 Market's


efficient
 and
 you
 can't
 get
 an
 advantage


then
 it's
 not
 only
 a
 waste
 of
 effort
 but


it's
 a
 waste
 of
 management
 fees
 uh
 that


and
 of
 course
 management
 fees
 are
 the


only
 certainty
 in
 the
 investing


world
 now
 another
 important
 question
 is


will
 you
 bet
 on
 macro


forecasts
 every
 body
 makes
 macro


forecasts
 and
 yet
 I
 don't
 believe
 that


they
 are
 of
 any
 use
 that's
 a
 mild


exaggeration
 but
 not
 so
 great
 um
 the


truth
 of
 the
 matter
 is
 that
 most
 of
 the


time
 things
 continue
 as
 they
 are
 so
 a


forecast
 of
 extrapolation
 is
 correct


most
 of
 the
 time
 and
 most
 people
 share


that
 view
 most
 people
 expect


extrapolation
 extrapolation
 of
 the


recent
 trends
 the
 long-term
 trends
 is


Incorporated
 in
 security


prices
 so
 when
 the
 extrapolation
 turns


out
 to
 be


correct
 it's
 not
 a
 profitable


expectation
 because
 everybody
 else
 had


it
 as
 well
 it
 was
 in
 the
 price
 you


paid
 the
 forecasts
 that
 are
 very


profitable
 are
 the
 ones
 that
 call
 for
 um


uh
 radical
 deviation
 from
 Trend
 radical


deviation
 from


extrapolation
 these
 are
 are
 very


significant
 when
 you
 make
 them
 and


they're
 right
 the
 trouble
 is
 they're
 not


right
 very
 often
 because
 most
 of
 the


time
 things
 are
 extrapolated
 and
 so
 we


have
 forecasts
 of
 extrapolation
 which


are
 usually
 correct
 but
 not
 profitable


and
 forecasts
 of
 Devi
 uh
 deviation
 from


Trend
 which
 are
 potentially
 very


profitable
 but
 not
 often
 correct
 I
 take


that
 an
 analysis
 to
 mean
 macro


forecasting
 doesn't
 work
 and
 uh
 one
 of


when
 we
 started
 oak
 tree
 29
 years
 ago


this
 month
 uh
 we
 sat
 down
 and
 we
 wrote


out
 the
 things
 we
 had
 been
 doing
 because


we
 had
 the
 benefit
 of
 having
 worked


together
 for
 nine
 years
 already
 on


average
 and
 uh
 we
 have
 a
 very
 simple


investment
 philosophy
 of
 six
 points


which
 governs
 everything
 we
 do
 and


number
 five
 says
 that
 our
 actions
 are


not
 driven
 by
 macro
 forecasts
 we
 are


bottomup
 investors
 selecting
 IND


individual
 companies
 not
 top-
 down


selecting
 markets
 and
 countries
 so


that's
 a
 different
 we
 think
 we
 can
 get


an
 uh
 an
 advantage
 by
 the
 way
 where
 does


outperforming
 come
 from
 in
 short
 it


comes
 from
 having
 a
 a
 knowledge


advantage
 and
 you
 have
 to
 know
 something


better
 than
 most
 other
 people
 to
 to


outperform
 just
 trying
 is
 not
 going
 to


help
 you
 if
 you
 don't
 know
 something


they
 don't
 know


so
 um
 we
 think
 we
 can
 get
 a
 knowledge


advantage
 in
 studying
 the
 micro


companies
 Industries
 and
 securities
 not


the
 macro
 countries
 markets
 and
 rates


for
 example
 so
 you
 know
 we
 bar
 that
 from


our
 approach
 I
 one
 of
 my
 heroes
 is
 John


Kenneth
 gbra
 who
 said
 we
 have
 two
 kinds


of
 forecasters
 the
 ones
 who
 don't
 know


and
 the
 ones
 who
 don't
 know
 they
 don't


know
 and
 I've
 known
 for
 decades
 that
 I


don't
 know
 so
 I
 think
 we
 have
 an


advantage
 in
 that
 and
 then
 uh
 that
 kind


of
 sounds
 like
 forecasting
 macro


forecasting
 is
 unavail
 unavailing
 but


the
 truth
 is
 that
 it
 can
 be
 worse
 than


in
 its
 effect
 it
 can
 be
 damaging
 in
 its


effect
 and
 I
 quote
 the
 American
 humorist


and
 novelist
 uh
 Mark
 Twain
 who
 said
 it


ain't
 what
 you
 don't
 know
 that
 gets
 you


into
 trouble
 it's
 what
 you
 know
 for


certain
 that
 just
 ain't


true
 no
 sentence
 that
 starts
 with
 I


don't
 know
 but
 or
 I
 could
 be
 wrong
 but


ever
 got
 anybody
 into
 trouble
 the
 ones


that
 get
 you
 into
 trouble
 are
 the
 ones


that
 say
 I'm
 sure
 that's
 such
 and
 such


because
 if
 you
 believe
 something


strongly
 and
 You
 Bet
 On
 It
 heavily
 and


you're
 wrong
 that's
 how
 you
 get
 into
 big


trouble
 so
 will
 you
 bet
 on
 macro


forecasting
 this
 in
 my
 opinion
 is
 a


critical
 and
 and
 uh
 overarching
 decision


I
 wrote
 a
 memo
 u
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago
 I


think
 it
 was
 October
 of
 22
 um
 entitled


the
 illusion
 of
 knowledge
 and
 it's
 it's


basically
 a
 rant
 against
 uh
 uh
 macro


forecasting
 starting
 with
 a
 macro
 for
 a


famous
 quote
 in
 each
 section
 um
 and
 uh
 I


I
 think
 it's
 it's
 extremely
 important
 to


decide
 will
 you
 or
 won't
 you
 start
 from


a
 top-
 down
 macro
 forecast
 and
 most


people
 do
 many
 people
 know
 they
 don't


work
 they
 do
 it
 anyway
 and
 one
 of
 the
 I


quote
 somebody
 in
 there
 as
 saying
 that


most
 people
 couldn't
 get
 out
 of
 bed
 in


the
 morning
 if
 they
 admitted
 how


uncertain
 the
 the
 future
 is
 uh
 and
 so
 I


believe
 that
 macro
 forecasting
 uh
 in
 my


view
 often
 takes
 the
 form
 of
 uh
 can
 I


say
 organized
 religion
 it
 gives


Something
 to
 Believe
 In
 to
 dispel
 uh
 the


great
 uncertainty
 uh
 present
 in
 the


world
 they
 live
 in
 um
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 I


believe
 that
 uh
 very
 few
 people
 have
 the


ability
 uh
 to
 do
 it
 in
 a
 superior


fashion
 now
 the
 next
 question
 is
 how


will
 you
 and
 your
 organization
 think


about
 risk
 what
 is
 risk
 um
 you
 know
 in


in
 all
 the
 uh
 formula
 uh
 mathematical


work
 in
 the
 investment
 business
 people


use
 variability
 of
 results
 as
 the


measure
 of
 risk
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 the


real
 risk
 I
 think
 the
 real
 risk
 is
 the


risk
 of
 bad


outcomes
 uh
 but
 um
 the
 trouble
 with
 my


form
 of
 risk
 is
 it's
 not
 measurable
 you


can't
 measure
 what
 the
 probability
 of


bad
 outcomes
 is
 in
 the
 future
 you
 can't


even
 measure
 what
 the
 probability
 of
 bad


outcomes
 was
 in
 the
 past
 you
 can
 only


only
 measure
 what
 happened
 which
 is
 a


subset
 of
 what
 could
 have
 happened
 I
 on


the
 last
 slide
 I
 I
 had
 a
 quote
 from


Elroy
 Dimson
 who
 was
 a
 pressor
 professor


at
 the
 London
 Business
 School
 he
 said


risk
 means
 more
 things
 can
 happen
 than


will
 happen
 the
 conventional
 view
 of


risk
 is
 shown
 in
 this
 graphic
 here
 you


have
 uh
 return
 on
 the
 vertical
 axis
 risk


on
 the
 horizontal
 axis
 and
 a
 line
 that


swaps
 up
 to
 the
 right
 and
 mathematicians


call
 this
 positive
 correlation
 if
 one


goes
 up
 the
 other
 goes
 up
 most


practitioners
 take
 this
 to
 mean
 that


riskier
 assets
 have
 higher


returns
 there's
 something
 wrong
 with


that
 formulation
 if
 riskier
 assets
 could


be
 counted
 on
 to
 have
 higher
 returns
 by


definition
 they
 wouldn't
 be
 risky
 so
 the


the
 way
 I
 look
 at
 it
 is
 more
 like
 this
 I


take
 these
 little
 bell-shaped
 curves
 I


simp
 impose
 them
 on
 the
 same
 line
 it's


the
 same
 underlying
 line
 but
 now
 as
 you


move
 from
 left
 to
 right
 not
 only
 does


the
 expected
 return
 increase
 but
 the


range
 of
 possible
 outcomes
 gets
 wider


and
 the
 bad
 outcomes
 become
 worse


that
 I
 think
 is
 risk
 that
 is
 what
 people


should
 concern
 themselves
 not
 the


possibility
 that
 their
 return
 streams


will
 be
 lumpy
 Buffett
 said
 I'd
 rather


have
 a
 lumpy
 15
 than
 a
 smooth
 12
 and
 uh


I
 think
 that
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense


so
 I
 think
 the
 most
 important
 job
 of
 the


professional
 investor
 is
 to
 manage
 risk


and
 uh
 you
 know
 Greg
 in
 his
 talk
 said


what
 do
 you
 believe
 in
 and
 I
 think


that's
 very
 important


and
 you
 you
 could
 hear
 in
 his


presentation
 how
 much
 of
 the
 time
 they


devote
 to
 assessing
 managing
 and


balancing
 risk
 and
 we
 have
 to
 do
 the


same
 thing
 we
 have
 to
 assess
 it
 and


manage
 it
 even
 though
 we
 do
 it
 from
 a


bottom
 up
 micro
 level
 not
 top
 down


but
 um
 I
 think
 that
 you
 have
 to


constantly
 work
 with
 uh
 risk
 but
 you


have
 to
 never
 assume
 as
 Mark
 Twain


cautions
 uh
 that
 you
 know
 it
 for
 certain


we
 never
 know
 what
 is
 going
 to


happen
 and
 the
 events
 show
 that
 in
 the


world
 we
 never
 know
 how
 the
 market
 will


react
 to
 What
 happens
 in
 the
 short
 run


uh
 and
 if
 you
 want
 proof
 of
 those
 two


statements
 take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 US


presidential
 election
 of
 2016
 everybody


was
 confident
 of
 two
 things
 Hillary


would
 win
 80%
 probable
 and
 if
 by
 some


Quirk
 of
 f
 Trump
 won
 the
 market
 would


collapse
 instead
 Trump
 won
 and
 the


market
 went
 up
 for
 14
 months
 30%
 so
 we


don't
 know
 and
 uh
 we
 don't
 ever
 assume


that
 our
 uh
 intellectual
 process
 permits


us
 to
 get
 uh
 the
 risk
 under


control
 and
 then
 lastly
 you
 have
 to


accept
 that
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 have
 both


Superior
 returns
 and
 low


risk
 um
 uh
 a
 high
 degree
 of
 safety


taking
 going
 for
 Superior
 returns
 mean


means
 taking
 some
 risk
 you
 have
 to


either
 bet
 on
 riskier
 companies
 riskier


propositions
 things
 that
 are
 considered


unpopular
 and
 out
 of
 favor
 and
 things


that
 if
 you're
 wrong
 will
 result
 in
 your


being
 below


average
 yet
 and
 you
 have
 to
 figure
 out


for
 yourself
 what
 your
 approach
 is
 I'm
 a


tennis
 player
 and
 last
 summer
 while


watching
 uh
 the
 tennis
 tournaments
 uh


especially
 Wimbleton
 um
 I
 wrote
 a
 memo


entitled
 few
 losers
 or
 more


winners
 you
 have
 to
 have
 an
 approach
 in


my
 opinion
 which
 will
 uh
 organize
 your


pursuit
 of
 superior
 returns
 and
 there's


really
 two
 ways
 to
 do
 it
 you
 have
 to


either
 have
 more
 of
 the
 things
 that
 do


above
 average
 or
 less
 than
 the
 less
 of


the
 things
 that
 do
 below
 average
 there


is
 no
 alternative
 of
 course
 you
 could
 do


both
 I
 think
 for
 most
 people
 given
 their


mentality
 one
 or
 the
 other
 is
 more


likely
 the
 the
 the
 conservative
 person


can
 in


theory
 have
 fewer
 of
 the
 things
 that
 do


poorly
 the
 skilled
 aggressive
 person
 can


in
 theory
 have
 more
 of
 the
 things
 that


do


well
 each
 person
 has
 to
 understand
 their


own
 mentality
 what's
 possible
 for
 them


and
 thus
 their
 Pursuit
 will
 what
 their


Pursuit
 will
 be
 and
 these
 things
 in
 my


opinion
 taken
 together
 are
 examples
 of


the
 elements
 that
 combine
 to
 produce
 uh


an
 investment
 philosophy
 and
 we've
 done


it
 at
 Oak
 everybody
 knows
 where
 we
 stand


everybody
 is
 pulling
 together
 in
 the


same
 direction
 thank
 you
 very


much


[Music]


okay
 thank
 you
 Howard
 um
 since
 you
 are


so
 kind
 to
 spend
 your
 birthday
 together


with
 us
 uh
 we
 did
 want
 to
 give
 you
 a


small
 gift
 thank
 you
 um
 I'm
 not
 sure
 if


you're
 aware
 but
 there's
 actually
 two


famous
 inventions
 that
 has
 come
 out
 of


Norway
 one
 is
 the
 paper
 clip
 and
 the


other
 one
 is
 the
 cheese
 slicer
 ah
 now
 we


thought
 it
 would
 be
 a
 pretty
 dull
 gift


to
 give
 away
 paper
 clips
 and
 hence
 we


wanted
 to
 uh
 give
 you
 this
 cheese


slicer
 in
 oak
 tree
 I
 should
 very
 good


and
 and
 with
 a
 small
 piece
 of
 local


cheese
 and
 now
 I
 can
 go
 home
 and
 make
 my


own
 open
 face
 sandwiches
 excellent
 thank


you
 I
 can
 take
 this
 one
 and
 if
 you
 want


to
 take
 the
 seat
 we
 go
 for


the
 thanks
 again
 Howard
 so
 now
 we
 will


have
 a
 panel


discussion
 um
 Howard
 Greg
 will
 come
 back


on
 the
 stage
 and
 they
 will
 be
 joined
 by


Jean
 Hines
 who
 is
 CEO
 of
 Wellington


Management
 together
 with
 Patrick
 Healey


the
 CEO
 of
 Helman
 and
 fredman


the
 panel
 discussion
 will
 be
 moderated


by
 our
 own
 Chief
 investment
 officer
 for


equities
 Pedro
 fad
 please
 give
 them
 a


warm


[Applause]


[Music]


[Applause]


[Music]


welcome
 it
 is
 such
 a
 privilege
 to
 have


the
 four
 of
 you
 with
 us
 today


Greg
 Howard
 what
 a
 way
 to
 start
 this


conference
 today
 that
 was
 incredible


thank
 you
 so
 much
 we
 are
 now
 joined
 by


Jin
 and
 Patrick
 and
 we'll
 aim
 to
 take


the
 discussion
 further
 so
 if
 I
 interrupt


any
 of
 you
 please
 bear
 with
 me
 this
 is


just
 to
 make
 the
 most
 of
 the
 time
 that


you
 have
 kindly
 given
 us
 Jin
 I'll
 start


with
 you
 so
 Greg
 and
 Howard
 uh
 ran


through
 their
 investment
 philosophy
 and


the
 need
 for
 an
 investment
 Creed
 you
 run


Wellington
 uh
 which
 can
 be
 seen
 as
 a


Federation
 of
 investment
 boutiques
 what


are
 really
 the
 advantages
 and
 the
 pits


of
 not
 having
 to
 have
 an
 overarching


investment
 philosophy
 thank
 you
 and
 um


thank
 you
 for
 sharing
 all
 your
 insights


that
 was
 really
 fascinating
 um
 when
 I


was
 sitting
 there
 listening
 it
 made
 me


think
 you
 know
 we
 have
 about
 60
 teams


like
 you
 said
 we're
 or
 we're
 not


organized
 by
 one
 overarching
 philosophy


and
 process
 I
 guess
 our
 overarching


philosophy
 and
 process
 is
 that
 we


believe
 a
 philosophy
 and
 process
 is


critical
 um
 to
 the
 investment
 team
 we


have
 about
 60
 teams
 um
 and
 um
 and
 and


each
 of
 those
 teams
 we
 have
 we
 have
 a


few
 in
 the
 audience
 today
 each
 of
 those


teams
 have
 a
 very
 strong
 philosophy
 and


process
 very
 similar
 to
 what
 um
 Greg
 and


Howard
 um
 do
 and
 that's
 what
 they


practice
 every
 day
 and
 that's
 what
 they


believe
 um
 we
 combine
 that
 at
 Wellington


um
 every
 I
 think
 every
 company
 has
 an


edge
 I
 think
 our
 Edge
 is
 um
 that
 we
 are


really
 collaborative
 so
 we
 have
 over
 the


you
 know
 I've
 been
 at
 Wellington
 for
 33


years
 over
 those
 33
 years
 we
 have
 really


broken
 down
 silos
 and
 so
 that
 our
 long


only
 investors
 on
 in
 equity
 collaborate


with
 our
 fixed
 income
 um
 um
 colleagues


who
 collaborate
 with
 our
 private
 col


colleagues
 who
 do
 private
 assets
 and
 who


do
 long
 short
 um
 that's
 the
 secret
 sauce


like
 how
 do
 we
 we
 don't
 have
 one
 CIO
 we


have
 600
 cios
 and
 we
 have
 normalized


debate
 having
 different
 perspectives
 on


any
 topic
 and
 then
 and
 then
 each
 of


those
 teams
 can
 go
 and
 practice
 their


very
 well
 thought
 out
 strong
 strongly


held
 beliefs
 about
 how
 they're
 going
 to


make
 money
 for
 clients
 that
 that's
 how


we're
 organized
 very
 good
 Patrick
 I'll


pull
 you
 into
 the
 conversation
 does
 the


private
 nature
 of
 what
 you
 do
 have
 any


direct
 implications
 on
 your
 investment


process
 is
 there
 anything
 intrinsically


different
 between
 private
 Market


investing
 and
 public
 market
 investing


well
 um
 I
 suppose
 given
 my
 deme
 of


nature
 I
 might
 sound
 like
 the
 poster
 TR


for
 private
 Equity
 but
 uh
 I'll
 say
 um


look
 I
 think
 private
 Equity
 is
 an


advantaged
 asset
 class
 if
 you're
 going


to
 be
 in
 the
 investment
 business
 um
 and


you
 sort
 of
 start
 with
 just
 the


structure
 you
 know
 we
 have
 a
 10
 we
 have


a
 a
 5year
 investment
 period
 we
 can
 have


the
 money
 invested
 for
 10
 maybe
 12
 years


so
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 invested
 all
 the


time
 you
 can
 pick
 your
 spots
 that's
 a


huge
 Advantage
 you
 get
 to
 do
 inside


diligence
 that's
 an
 absolutely
 huge


Advantage
 you
 get
 to
 choose
 and
 select


your
 management
 teams
 you
 get
 to
 borrow


money
 and
 I've
 been
 doing
 this
 for
 30


years
 and
 I
 can
 remember
 I
 really
 over


you
 know
 my
 first
 15
 years
 you're


actually
 borrowed
 money
 with
 covenants


but
 for
 the
 last
 15
 years
 we
 get
 lent


money
 without
 covenants
 so
 that's
 sort


of
 extraordinary
 you
 get
 to
 choose
 when


you
 want
 to
 sell
 a
 business
 um
 and
 you


get
 to
 have
 alignment
 you
 know
 in
 the


boardroom
 it's
 sort
 of
 the
 investor
 and


the
 management
 team
 you
 get
 to
 choose


three
 to
 four
 things
 that
 you
 really


want
 to
 go
 for
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 huge


Advantage
 so
 as
 we
 think
 about
 sort
 of


our
 own
 investment
 process
 and
 sort
 of


managing
 risk
 like
 Howard
 and
 Greg
 you


know
 talked
 about
 you
 know
 it's
 really


about
 being
 super
 micro
 obsessed
 with


the
 specifics
 of
 the
 business
 and


ensuring
 that
 we
 you
 know
 maintain
 our


standards
 that
 way
 M
 and
 you
 really


invest
 for
 the
 long
 term
 and
 that
 could


be
 like
 a
 good
 say
 Segway
 into
 long-term


investing
 um
 Greg
 Howard
 how
 do
 you


incorporate
 how
 does
 investment
 Horizon


fit
 into
 your
 investment
 philosophy
 and


your
 invest
 or
 like
 philosopy
 Creed
 well


like
 uh
 Patrick
 says
 U
 maybe
 half
 of
 our


assets
 are
 closed
 end
 funds
 where
 you


have
 the
 money
 for
 a
 period
 of
 time
 and


the
 great
 Advantage
 is
 is
 that
 the


clients
 can't
 withdraw
 so
 you
 know


they
 people
 out
 of
 control
 of
 their


situation
 love
 to
 buy
 when
 they're


excited
 and
 sell
 when
 they're
 depressed


and
 our
 our
 this
 approach
 keeps
 them


from
 doing
 so
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 greatest


Advantage
 one
 can
 have
 in
 the
 investment


business
 um
 I
 think
 that
 everybody
 at


Oak
 Tree
 understands
 our
 culture
 we


don't
 we
 actually
 don't
 even
 have
 a


tenant
 of
 our
 philosophy
 that
 talks


about
 long-term
 investing
 it's
 just


understood
 you
 know
 when
 I
 when
 I
 travel


especially
 to
 Europe
 and
 people
 find
 out


I'm
 in
 the
 investment
 business
 they
 say


oh
 what
 do
 you
 trade
 my
 back
 goes
 up
 I


said
 we
 don't
 trade
 trading
 is
 guessing


what
 something's
 going
 to
 do
 tomorrow


we're
 investors
 we're
 in
 it
 for
 the
 long


term
 and
 I
 think
 that
 um
 I
 think


everybody
 on
 this
 stage
 is
 more
 of
 an


investor
 than
 a
 Trader
 uh
 it
 I
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 understand
 how
 one
 gets
 an


advantage
 in
 the
 short
 term
 running
 such


a
 systematic
 strategy
 G
 GRE
 do
 you


agree
 well
 I
 think
 the
 main
 things
 is


when
 I
 listen
 to
 Howard
 and
 and
 what


everybody
 on
 the
 stage
 is
 saying
 I
 think


the
 main
 thing
 is
 is
 in
 the
 long
 term


you
 have
 to
 know
 what
 your
 advantage
 is


and
 that's
 the
 big
 thing
 right
 so
 for
 us


our
 our
 time
 frame
 that
 we
 really


understand
 well
 and
 we
 focus
 on
 is
 6
 to


18
 months
 so
 for
 some
 that's
 very
 long


term
 for
 some
 that's
 very
 short
 term
 but


but
 6
 to
 18
 months
 is
 what
 we've
 thought


really
 hard
 about
 and
 um
 and
 believe


despite
 Howard's
 thoughts
 on
 macro


investing
 that


that
 we
 have
 an
 edge
 in
 understanding


what's
 happened
 the
 world
 now
 we
 are


wrong
 a
 lot
 to
 his
 point
 and
 so
 you
 have


to
 know
 how
 to
 be
 prepar
 for
 being
 wrong


and
 within
 macro
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 macro


things
 going
 on
 so
 you
 can
 diversify


across
 many
 different
 things
 that
 you're


you're
 talking
 about
 but
 um
 but
 I
 think


the
 starting
 point
 is
 that
 and
 that


there
 the
 long
 term
 is
 going
 to
 work
 out


if
 you
 know
 what
 your
 Edge
 is
 if
 you


stick
 to
 it
 if
 you're
 humble
 about
 it


and
 you
 continue
 to
 learn
 and
 long
 term


is
 not
 going
 to
 work
 out
 if
 you're
 stuck


on
 any
 particular
 um
 thing
 that
 you


might
 be
 wrong
 about
 about
 and
 that
 you


don't
 have
 a
 way
 of
 constantly
 improving


and
 constantly
 learning
 um
 but
 for
 each


of
 us
 I
 think
 the
 main
 question
 is
 what


is
 the
 edge
 do
 you
 actually
 have
 it
 and


can
 you
 continue
 to
 improve
 it
 mhm
 Jin


you
 are
 known
 as
 a
 very
 long-term


investor
 in
 your
 portfolio
 manager
 days


which
 still
 um
 one
 how
 do
 you
 encourage


your
 portfolio
 managers
 at
 Wellington
 to


think
 long
 term
 so
 part
 of
 it
 is
 our


structure
 because
 we
 are
 a
 private


partnership
 we
 are
 we
 we
 can
 incent


investors
 we
 can
 evaluate
 them
 we


develop
 them
 over
 for
 long
 periods
 of


time
 so
 that
 that
 structure
 enables
 that


that
 we
 are
 we
 are
 really
 paying
 our


investors
 over
 very
 aligned
 with
 our


clients
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 one
 of
 the


very
 key
 advantages
 um
 and
 then
 because


we
 have
 60
 investors
 like
 I'm
 one
 of
 the


longest
 term
 I'm
 probably
 very
 similar


to
 Howard
 I
 don't
 quite
 have
 a
 12year


horizon
 but
 I
 have
 a
 really
 low
 turnover


my
 turnover
 is
 10
 to
 12%
 it
 very
 much


aligns
 with
 the
 industry
 that
 I
 invest


in
 which
 is
 a
 very
 long
 cycle
 low


turnover
 low
 turnover
 industry
 and


Healthcare
 um
 but
 but
 there
 are
 others


that
 have
 higher
 turnover
 and
 so
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 we
 try
 to
 do
 is
 we
 we
 do


a
 lot
 of
 trading
 analytics
 are
 you


making
 money
 off
 your
 trading
 if
 you're


not
 if
 you
 have
 a
 shorter
 term
 time


Horizon
 um
 back
 to
 what
 Greg
 said
 what's


your
 sweet
 spot
 of
 of
 um
 H
 having


insights
 and
 and
 being
 able
 to
 so
 there


are
 some
 people
 who
 are
 fantastic
 who


have
 high
 turnover
 and
 then
 and
 then
 I


strongly
 believe
 for
 me
 as
 a
 as
 an


investor
 having
 a
 a
 low
 turn
 ER
 strategy


is
 and
 really
 taking
 advantage
 of
 the


insights
 I
 have
 over
 the
 long
 term
 is


what
 has
 enabled
 me
 to
 do
 well
 over
 many


years
 but
 really
 having
 that


self-awareness
 of
 how
 you
 generate


insights
 how
 you're
 going
 to
 make
 money


for
 your
 clients
 with
 whatever
 asset


class
 you
 have
 I
 think
 is
 key
 to
 that


excellent
 Howard
 you
 touched
 on
 on


market
 efficiency
 and
 the
 importance
 of


that
 there's
 now
 endless
 information
 and


a
 lot
 of
 noise
 in
 the
 market
 um
 but


markets
 are
 arguably
 become
 more


efficient
 over
 time
 so
 a
 question
 to


both
 of
 you
 how
 do
 you
 compare
 the
 alpha


generation
 opportunity
 of
 your


investment
 strategies
 now
 compared
 to


say
 10
 20
 years
 ago
 I
 think
 it's
 gotten


a
 lot
 harder
 over
 time
 Pedro
 you
 know
 uh


Warren
 Buffett
 talked
 about
 having


bought
 dollars
 for
 50
 cents
 60
 uh
 years


ago
 you
 could
 do
 that
 50
 40
 years
 ago
 I


myself
 bought
 things
 that
 I
 thought
 this


this
 can't
 be
 exist
 and
 yet
 you
 you
 got


Bargains
 virtually
 that
 couldn't
 miss


it's
 very
 hard
 today
 uh
 if
 you
 think


about
 it
 everybody
 knows
 everything


today
 there's
 no
 such
 thing
 today
 as
 not


knowing
 something
 if
 it's
 if
 it's
 fact


uh
 today
 it's
 rather
 easy
 for
 portfolio


managers
 to
 screen
 for
 Securities
 that


satisfy
 certain
 criteria
 you
 know
 used


to
 be
 able
 to
 buy
 companies
 for
 less


than
 their
 the
 cash
 in
 the
 till
 uh
 we


called
 that
 net
 net
 investing
 you
 can't


do
 that
 anymore
 and
 so
 over
 time
 uh


knowledge
 is
 cumulative
 markets
 become


more
 efficient
 uh
 it
 has
 become
 harder


uh
 to
 beat


markets
 still
 I
 believe
 some
 people
 can


be
 superior
 their
 margin
 of
 superiority


May
 shrink
 their
 their
 work
 day
 may
 get


longer
 uh
 but
 I
 I
 still
 it's
 possible


but
 it
 becomes
 harder
 every


day
 yeah
 I
 think
 again
 it
 depends
 on
 the


nature
 like
 even
 when
 you
 describe
 it
 50


years
 ago
 people
 could
 but
 not
 most


people
 didn't
 right
 like
 even
 like
 at


some
 point
 having
 a
 calculator
 was
 an


advantage
 and
 obviously
 having
 a


calculator
 is
 no
 longer
 at
 Advantage
 but


I
 I
 look
 at
 it
 a
 little
 differently
 I


think
 it's
 like
 the
 nd500
 or
 whatever


the
 cars
 get
 better
 every
 year
 so
 you


have
 to
 get
 better
 every
 year
 but


there's
 still
 a
 winner
 MH
 um
 and
 so
 if


you
 stay
 if
 you
 don't
 get
 better
 then


you
 for
 sure
 any
 advantage
 will
 will


seep
 into
 General
 understanding
 but
 if


you
 continue
 to
 get
 better
 it
 is
 like


the
 n500
 and
 the
 core
 at
 least
 the
 the


core
 things
 that
 I
 believe
 our
 Alpha
 is


generated
 from
 really
 aren't
 changing


much
 I
 don't
 think
 we're
 getting
 any


better
 as
 a
 species
 on
 things
 like
 love


and
 fear
 and
 greed
 like
 we
 keep
 doing


the
 same
 things
 more
 or
 less
 over
 and


over
 again
 so
 I
 agree
 on
 things
 like


calculating
 and


Arbitrage
 that
 is
 like
 much
 easier
 to
 do


it's
 generally
 well
 known
 those
 things


are
 not
 there
 anymore
 but
 the
 fact
 that


people
 are
 going
 to
 make
 we
 all
 will


make
 really
 dumb
 mistakes
 and
 if
 you


have
 ways
 of
 understanding
 that
 and


doing
 that
 that
 that
 continues
 and
 I


really
 when
 I
 look
 at
 the
 markets
 and


the
 volatility
 of
 the
 prices
 relative
 to


the
 fundamental
 conditions
 or
 whatever


it
 doesn't
 look
 like
 we're
 getting
 that


much
 smarter
 um
 it's
 true
 on
 arbitrages


are
 going
 away
 I
 think
 that
 is
 the
 case


things
 that
 you
 can
 calculate
 are
 going


away
 things
 that
 are
 very
 hard
 to


calculate
 seem
 as
 volatile
 as
 ever
 um


and
 the
 miscalculations
 of
 human
 beings


continue
 um
 so
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 again


I
 would
 agree
 if
 it's
 an
 establish


Arbitrage
 it
 will
 not
 exist
 for
 like


it'll
 get
 learned
 but
 other
 things
 um


continue
 more
 or
 less
 as
 they
 have


through
 all
 human
 history
 appears
 to
 me


are
 there
 still
 more
 inefficiencies
 in


uh
 in
 private
 markets
 to
 be
 explored


relative
 to
 public
 and
 for
 how
 long
 I


think
 the
 PRI
 I
 mean
 private
 markets


were
 what
 40
 years
 now
 into
 instit


institutionalization
 of
 private
 markets


and
 you
 know
 for
 sure
 private
 Equity
 um


I
 think
 that
 there
 uh
 you
 know
 is
 a


whole
 class
 of
 uh
 investing
 that
 goes
 on


a
 my
 world
 where
 we
 buy
 from
 each


other's
 portfolios
 cuz
 like
 uh
 you
 know


why
 do
 you
 rob
 a
 bank
 cuz
 that's
 where


the
 money
 is
 so
 many
 assets
 are
 owned
 in


private
 hands
 so
 I
 look
 at
 Christian
 we


bought
 a
 business
 from
 you
 Nick
 humph
 is


here
 from
 HG
 we
 bought
 businesses
 from


them
 and
 what's
 really
 interesting
 is


the
 return
 profile
 of
 buying
 things
 in


the
 private
 markets
 even
 from


professional
 owners
 like
 sponsors
 is


really
 the
 same
 as
 it
 would
 be
 for
 a


primary
 buyout
 and
 so
 you
 sort
 of
 sit


there
 you
 say
 you
 ask
 yourself
 why
 and
 I


think
 it's
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 factors


including
 you
 know
 having
 a


differentiate
 point
 of
 view
 which
 Howard


spoke
 about
 it's
 having
 professionally


trained
 management
 teams
 that
 really
 you


know
 know
 what
 they're
 doing
 in
 terms
 of


businesses
 so
 I
 actually
 think
 right
 now


uh
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 inefficiencies
 in
 in


the
 public
 markets
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 ton


of
 really
 good
 businesses
 but
 crummy


stocks
 you
 know
 25%
 of
 the
 public


markets
 are
 50%
 or
 below
 their
 highs
 so


you
 know
 in
 terms
 of
 my
 shopping
 list
 um


I'm
 spending
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 time
 at


the
 public
 markets
 right
 now
 because
 I


think
 you
 get
 much
 more
 volatility
 in


the
 Public
 Public
 markets
 than
 you
 do
 in


the
 private
 markets
 cuz
 when
 you're


private
 and
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 sell


you
 don't


sell
 changing
 t
 a
 bit
 Greg
 talked
 about


the
 power
 of
 compounding
 learning
 um


things
 may
 not
 always
 pan
 out
 the
 way


that
 we
 thought
 that
 we
 think
 that
 they


will
 um
 how
 do
 you
 instit


institutionalize
 learning
 from
 mistakes


in
 your


organization
 so
 um
 we
 do
 we
 do
 a
 number


of
 things
 some
 shortterm
 we
 have
 a
 daily


meeting
 every
 day
 and
 in
 that
 daily


meeting
 which
 happens
 in
 our
 London


office
 between
 Asia
 and
 London
 and
 and


and
 between
 Boston
 and
 our
 us
 offices


and
 and
 London
 every
 day
 we
 talk
 about


um
 all
 kinds
 of
 things
 and
 including


sometimes
 we
 talk
 about
 if
 something's


happening
 in
 the
 market
 you
 know
 what


did
 you
 learn
 from
 the
 last
 time
 the


market
 was
 like
 then
 what
 what
 mistakes


did
 you
 learn
 so
 we
 do
 that
 that's
 sort


of
 a
 constant
 a
 constant
 and
 back
 to


like
 having
 different
 perspectives
 there


will
 be
 people
 that
 will
 come
 to
 our


daily
 meeting
 and
 said
 I
 got
 this
 wrong


and
 this
 is
 what
 I
 learned
 so
 we
 have


normalized
 um
 sort
 of
 not
 being
 a
 star


and
 not
 being
 right
 all
 the
 time
 which


is
 as
 we
 know
 being
 an
 investor
 you're


wrong
 quite
 often
 um
 so
 that
 so
 those


are
 some
 of
 the
 things
 we
 do
 and
 then
 we


also
 do
 these
 things
 called
 Lessons


Learned
 so
 we
 would
 have
 someone
 who's


been
 investing
 for
 25
 years
 or
 30
 years


and
 um
 and
 we
 ask
 them
 to
 be
 vulnerable


like
 what
 like
 what
 was
 what
 really
 was


the
 reason
 and
 the
 seminal
 moments
 in


your
 investing
 career
 and
 it's
 really


about
 investing
 these
 these
 talks
 who


they
 are
 as
 a
 person
 what
 do
 they


believe
 in
 how
 are
 they're
 investing


what
 are
 the
 four
 or
 five
 guide
 posts


that
 sort
 of
 made
 their
 career
 and
 those


are
 all
 recorded
 and
 people
 watch
 them


and
 and
 learn
 from
 them
 um
 and
 it
 gives


you
 a
 good
 appreciation
 of
 of
 just
 that


people
 are
 human
 beings
 um
 we
 try
 to
 you


know
 we
 don't
 have
 a
 star
 culture
 and


the
 more
 people
 are
 willing
 to
 teach


others
 um
 and
 teach
 themselves
 that
 and


you
 know
 as
 we
 know
 you
 you
 you
 haven't


learned
 everything
 like
 I'm
 in
 my


mid-50s
 I've
 been
 investing
 for
 33
 years


I'm
 still
 learning
 um
 and
 so
 how
 do
 you


how
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 that's
 part
 of


the
 everyday
 language
 so
 those
 are
 some


of
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 the
 things
 we
 do


constantly
 over
 time
 that
 sort
 of


normalizes
 the
 fact
 that
 you're
 making


mistakes
 all
 the
 time
 good
 Howard
 any


views
 on
 the
 institutionalization
 of
 M


mistakes
 um
 you
 know
 we
 we
 don't
 have
 a


process
 for
 that
 uh
 your
 question


suggests
 to
 me
 maybe
 that
 we
 should
 uh


and
 May
 and
 maybe
 that's
 why
 I'm
 curious


and
 maybe
 we
 will
 uh
 but
 uh
 our


uh
 we
 have
 groups
 as
 as
 Jean
 says
 uh
 and


and
 a
 high
 degree
 of
 uh
 Independence
 uh


we're
 decentralized
 in
 our


decision-making
 process
 as
 long
 as
 in


our
 case
 everybody
 follows
 the
 same


philosophy
 and
 goal
 system
 uh
 uh
 but
 uh


but
 we
 don't
 have
 a
 process
 for
 uh


post-mortems
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


good
 way
 to


learn
 it's
 so
 so
 critical
 to
 our


philosophy
 and
 we
 to
 be
 clear
 it's
 very


hard
 because
 the
 thing
 that
 she's


talking
 about
 was
 so
 important
 which
 is


you
 you
 the
 last
 thing
 you
 want
 to
 do
 is


punish
 mistakes
 you
 have
 to
 help
 people


learn
 and
 and
 so
 we've
 struggled
 with


the
 right
 institutionalization
 but
 I've


been
 institutionalizing
 this
 for
 a
 long


time
 so
 just
 to
 share
 quickly
 thoughts


on
 it
 I
 mean
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 would
 say


if
 I
 were
 in
 anybody's
 organization
 that


doesn't
 like
 having
 a
 real
 issue
 log
 is


so
 valuable
 and
 it
 actually
 works
 like


for
 us
 it's
 very
 easy
 for
 people
 to


enter
 issues
 and
 again
 when
 you
 think


through
 what
 are
 the
 issues
 that
 matter


everybody's
 got
 issues
 but
 the
 issues


that
 matter
 to
 us
 are
 the
 things
 that


are
 preventing
 you
 from
 achieving
 your


goals
 and
 so
 to
 me
 then
 having
 a


diagnosis
 process
 that
 we
 let
 people


make
 it
 easy
 for
 people
 to
 enter
 and


make
 it
 easy
 for
 people
 like
 to
 diagnose


what's
 happening
 there's
 two
 levels
 of


that
 there's
 the
 level
 of
 like
 in
 the


org
 problems
 but
 then
 you
 have
 this


record
 you
 actually
 diagnose
 and
 decide


are
 you
 going
 to
 change
 anything
 as
 a


result
 of
 this
 right
 it's
 easy
 to
 talk


about
 problems
 but
 are
 you
 actually


changing
 anything
 and
 often
 times
 right


answer
 is
 I'm
 not
 changing
 anything
 um


like
 that
 mistakes
 are
 a
 normal
 part
 of


it
 but
 knowing
 whether
 actively
 deciding


are
 we
 going
 to
 change
 something
 or
 are


we
 not
 going
 to
 change
 something
 super


important
 so
 having
 a
 simple
 way
 for


people
 to
 do
 that
 and
 see
 that
 it's


actually
 happening
 is
 super
 important


encouraging
 it
 mostly
 most
 important
 is


that
 the
 most
 senior
 leaders
 the
 CEO
 the


CIO
 they're
 the
 ones
 getting
 issue


logged
 and
 they're
 the
 ones
 staring


because
 they
 make
 the
 biggest
 most


important
 decisions
 so
 making
 sure
 the


arrow
 of
 accountability
 goes
 up
 not
 down


um
 super
 critical
 lesson
 in
 our
 I
 think


we
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 arrow
 going
 down
 and


it
 was
 a
 big
 mistake
 encouraging
 the


arrow
 of
 accountability
 to
 go
 up
 uh
 was


a
 huge
 lesson
 in
 our
 organization
 i'


change
 everything
 I
 honestly
 believe
 and


the
 um
 and
 then
 on
 the
 investment


process
 I
 me
 one
 of
 the
 great
 things


back
 to
 systematic
 investing
 is
 you
 we


know
 on
 attribution
 every
 mistake
 down


to
 every
 data
 every
 little
 piece
 of


logic
 every
 data
 Ser
 we
 know
 exactly
 why


we
 got
 everything
 wrong
 like
 speaking
 to


his
 to
 his
 point
 about
 terrible
 macro


investing
 right
 like
 I
 really
 thought
 we


were
 going
 into
 a
 recession
 two
 and
 two


years
 ago
 or
 so
 and
 man
 was
 I
 wrong


right
 and
 and
 but
 okay
 we
 learned


something
 about
 the
 world
 that
 we
 didn't


know
 and
 um
 and
 by
 being
 able
 to


attribute
 that
 to
 every
 line
 of


reasoning
 everything
 that
 we
 had
 ever


learned
 that
 led
 us
 to
 that
 pretty


strong
 conclusion
 not
 so
 strong
 that
 was


disastrous
 in
 the
 way
 he's
 saying
 but


pretty
 strong
 conclusion
 knowing
 that
 we


could
 easily
 be
 wrong
 but
 that
 that
 but


being
 able
 to
 attribute
 that
 to


everything
 else
 and
 then
 attribute
 well


where
 did
 the
 money
 come
 from
 that


prevented
 that
 recession
 attribute
 every


one
 of
 those
 things
 and
 what
 do
 you


learn
 from
 that
 super
 super
 critical


thing
 to
 get
 to
 get
 right
 and
 I
 would


just
 say
 the
 thing
 I
 think
 everybody
 can


do
 and
 I
 would
 highly
 recommend
 is
 have


an
 issue
 log
 diagnose
 important
 issues


get
 in
 the
 habit
 of
 it
 and
 normalize
 it


it'll
 make
 the
 organization
 so
 much


better
 excellent
 one
 last
 topic
 before


we
 wrap
 up


specialization
 um
 so
 when
 investing
 what


are
 the
 tradeoffs
 uh
 between


specializing
 too
 much
 and
 missing
 the


big
 picture
 well
 I
 used
 to
 have
 a


yellowed
 clipping
 above
 my
 desk
 50
 years


ago
 orange
 so
 it
 came
 from
 the
 f


and
 it
 said
 that
 an
 analyst
 is
 somebody


who
 knows
 a
 lot
 about
 a
 few
 things
 and


learns
 more
 and
 more
 about
 less
 and
 less


until
 he
 knows
 everything
 about
 nothing


a
 portfolio
 manager
 is
 somebody
 who


knows
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 a
 lot
 of
 things


and
 learns
 less
 and
 less
 about
 more
 and


more
 until
 he
 knows
 nothing
 about


everything
 we
 have
 to
 bridge
 that
 Gap
 we


have
 to
 know
 that
 there's
 information
 in


our
 organization
 that
 some
 people
 have


and
 other
 people
 need
 and
 we
 have
 to
 get


it
 to
 them
 and
 the
 people
 who
 need
 it


have
 to
 know
 that
 it
 exists
 and
 where


this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 greatest
 uh


challenges
 in
 our
 in
 any
 organization


Greg
 described
 uh
 the
 way
 all
 of
 their


uh
 learnings
 and
 findings
 are


actually
 uh
 computerize
 and
 computerized


and
 shared
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 good
 idea


but
 um
 you
 know
 how
 will
 the
 portfolio


manager
 who
 has
 to
 put
 together
 a
 large


number
 of
 assets
 about
 which
 he
 knows


less
 ever
 get
 full
 advantage
 of
 of
 the


knowledge
 that
 the
 analysts
 who
 know
 so


much
 about
 a
 few
 things
 have
 and
 it's


you
 know
 we
 struggle
 with
 it
 all
 the


time
 there's
 no
 easy


answer
 very
 good
 we
 could
 go
 on
 forever


but
 we
 must
 finish
 now
 we
 will
 take
 a


break
 now
 Refreshments
 will
 be
 served
 uh


at
 the
 back
 in
 the
 cantin
 uh
 for
 those


of
 you
 watching
 live
 somewhere
 there
 uh


we
 will
 back
 in
 the
 room
 at
 11:
 at
 1:45


p.m.
 sorry
 um
 but
 before
 closing
 let
 me


thank
 you
 all
 for
 spending
 the
 time
 with


us
 uh
 in
 Oso
 today
 it
 was
 an
 immense


pleasure
 to
 have
 the
 four
 of
 you
 in
 this


panel
 please
 join
 me
 for
 a
 round
 of


applause


[Music]


[Applause]

[Music]


investment
 management
 is
 about
 taking


risk
 and
 quite
 frankly
 that's
 what
 makes


it
 so
 much
 fun
 but
 risks
 that
 means


things
 can
 go
 wrong
 and
 from
 time
 to


time
 they
 do
 and
 when
 the
 big
 ones


happen
 man
 it
 can
 feel
 like
 a
 gut
 punch


it
 really
 can
 the
 thing
 is
 is
 that
 in


this
 game
 we
 know
 that
 this
 can
 and
 will


happen
 um
 it's
 just
 the
 way
 it
 works


structurally
 but
 that
 just
 does
 not


prepare
 you
 for
 your
 reaction
 when
 it


actually
 does
 take
 place
 and
 that


reaction
 is
 so
 important
 and
 the


different
 dimensions
 to
 that
 reaction


like
 what's
 your
 reaction
 as
 an


individual
 what's
 the
 reaction
 of
 your


colleagues
 incredibly
 importantly
 what's


the
 reaction
 of
 management
 how
 that
 all


fits
 together
 that
 really
 determines
 how


we
 deal
 with
 adversity
 and
 challenges


going
 forward
 talking
 about


psychological
 safety
 when
 everything's


going
 smoothly
 it's
 super
 easy
 but
 it's


when
 you're
 out
 there
 in
 the
 really


rough
 water
 that's
 when
 you
 as
 an


individual
 and
 we
 as
 an
 organization
 are


really


[Music]


tested


mistake
 an
 easy
 word
 to
 say
 but
 a


difficult
 one
 to
 admit
 this
 is
 why
 it's


important
 that
 investors
 are
 in
 an


environment


where
 they
 can
 fail
 and
 try


again
 our
 first
 speaker
 for
 our
 session


on
 successful
 investment
 organizations


is
 Amy


Edmundson
 she
 is
 a
 professor
 from
 the


Harvard
 Business
 School
 and
 has


dedicated
 her
 entire
 career
 to


understanding
 the
 many
 benefits
 of


psychological


safety
 today
 she'll
 be
 having
 a


conversation
 with
 andash
 melan
 from
 nbim


a
 sports
 psychologist
 who
 helps
 our


portfolio
 managers
 make
 more
 money
 so


please
 uh
 welcome
 Amy
 online
 and
 unes
 on


[Applause]


[Music]


stage
 now
 I
 I
 can't
 quite
 hear


you


conversation
 there
 you
 can
 hear
 me
 now


now
 I
 can
 yeah
 all
 right
 but
 here
 it's


super
 safe
 so
 uh
 no


problem
 okay
 great
 I
 loved
 it
 I
 Lov
 the


opening
 I
 loved
 the
 video
 yeah
 same
 here


we
 have
 fantastic
 people
 here
 and
 uh


yeah
 it
 takes
 a
 toll
 on
 them
 once
 in
 a


while
 you
 know
 yeah
 so
 um
 psychological


safety
 why
 do
 we
 need
 it
 it
 as
 investors


and
 what
 does
 it
 look


like
 well
 I
 I
 think
 you
 need


psychological
 safety
 as
 investors


because
 your
 success
 depends
 on
 your


ability
 to
 make
 high
 quality
 bets
 now


you
 might
 not
 like
 the
 word
 bets
 you


might
 prefer
 decisions
 or
 Investments


but
 make
 no
 mistake
 they're
 bets
 right


there
 there's
 uncertainty
 in
 in
 in
 in


that
 way
 um
 and
 those
 are
 absolutely


dependent
 on
 high
 quality
 conversations


and
 high
 quality
 conversations
 are


dependent
 on
 psychological
 safety
 they


require
 that
 people
 lean
 in
 and
 say
 the


uncomfortable
 truths
 when
 they
 they


raise
 an
 idea
 they
 raise
 a
 concern
 they


raise
 a
 dissenting
 View
 and
 the


conversation
 includes
 sort
 of
 questions


and
 answers
 and
 and
 and
 makes
 thoughtful


progress
 toward
 an
 uncertain
 resolution


but
 one
 that
 people
 feel
 is
 is
 high


enough
 quality
 to
 go
 forward
 right
 so


what
 does
 it
 look
 like
 looks
 like
 a


sense
 of
 permission
 for
 cander
 it
 does


not
 look
 comfortable
 you
 know
 in
 fact
 it


it
 probably
 looks
 a
 little
 uncomfortable


because
 it's
 not
 natural
 and
 normal
 to


sort
 of
 to
 lean
 in
 with
 the
 thoughts
 you


have
 that
 you're
 not
 absolutely
 sure
 are


right
 or


helpful
 yeah
 so
 so
 the
 obvious
 question


is
 also
 when
 it
 becomes
 kind
 of
 um


unsafe
 it
 it
 becomes
 unsafe
 once
 in
 a


while
 anytime
 but
 when
 it
 Bec
 comes
 like


chronically
 unsafe
 what
 what
 do
 we
 do


any
 advice
 to
 the
 audience
 here
 ah
 yeah


I
 mean
 because
 when
 it
 becomes


chronically
 unsafe
 what
 what
 you
 end
 up


with
 which
 by
 the
 way
 is
 invisible
 and
 I


think
 that's
 really
 important
 you
 know


to
 recognize
 the
 the
 asymmetry
 um
 here


because
 you
 can
 hear
 when
 people
 speak


up
 you
 cannot
 hear
 when
 they
 hold
 back


you
 just
 don't
 know
 that
 there
 actually


is
 something
 in
 their
 heads
 that
 they're


not
 sharing
 so
 so
 in
 a
 sense
 as
 a
 leader


you
 have
 to
 assume
 that
 it
 may
 be


happening
 and
 that
 that
 it
 may
 put
 you


at
 risk
 and
 and
 the
 quality
 of
 the
 work


at
 risk
 so
 I
 think
 what
 the
 the
 place
 to


start
 is
 just
 and
 it
 may
 seem
 you
 know


old
 or
 redundant
 but
 keep
 reminding


people
 of
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 work
 you're


doing
 that
 the
 work
 you're
 doing


necessarily
 includes
 uncertainty
 right


it
 necessarily
 benefits
 from
 diverse


perspectives
 or
 backgrounds
 that
 you


know
 that
 that
 have
 a
 different
 angle


on
 the
 situation
 um
 and
 so
 it's
 it's
 um


when
 I
 and
 why
 why
 does
 that
 matter


because
 when
 you
 are
 reminding
 people
 of


the
 uncertainty
 and
 what's
 at
 stake


you're
 setting
 a
 kind
 of
 intellectual


rationale
 for
 why
 it
 actually
 makes


sense
 that
 you
 do
 care
 about
 their


voice
 so
 it's
 so
 you
 actually
 focus
 on


the
 on
 the
 why
 we
 need
 it
 so
 the
 driv


not
 so
 talking
 too
 much
 about


psychological
 safety
 might
 have
 backfire


a
 bit
 no
 no
 in
 fact
 some
 ways
 if
 if
 I


had
 my
 brothers
 I'd
 recommend
 don't
 talk


about
 it
 at
 all
 but
 just
 talk
 about
 what


does
 a
 high
 quality
 conversation
 look


like
 how
 does
 it
 include
 people
 you
 know


really
 taking
 those
 risks
 to
 share
 their


thoughts
 and
 being
 willing
 to
 listen


intently
 in
 the
 moments
 when
 they're
 not


speaking
 right
 so
 that
 together
 we
 are


making
 progress
 toward
 the
 best
 possible


decision
 we
 can


make
 all
 right
 so
 so
 this
 cycle
 ological


safety
 goes
 a
 bit
 up
 and
 down
 so
 it


fluctuates
 a
 bit
 so
 but
 how
 vulnerable


is
 it
 really
 from
 your
 perspective
 maybe


that's
 a
 bit
 too
 a
 global
 question
 yeah


I
 mean
 this
 is
 the
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 the


problem
 is
 that
 it's
 it's
 actually
 quite


ve
 vulnerable
 um
 and
 I
 I
 think
 there's


two


asymmetries
 uh
 that
 that
 that
 people


need
 to
 internalize
 uh
 and
 sort
 of


intellectually
 and
 maybe
 emotionally
 as


well
 and
 one
 is
 what
 I
 call
 the
 risk


reward
 calculus
 right
 and
 that's
 the
 if


I
 mean
 imagine
 a
 moment
 where
 you
 are


weighing
 maybe
 not
 entirely
 consciously


but
 you're
 you're
 you're
 weighing


whether
 or
 not
 to
 speak
 up
 about


something
 to
 share
 a
 thought
 a
 view
 and


in
 that


moment
 if
 you
 were
 to
 speak
 who
 gains


well
 the
 team
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 um


the
 organization
 if
 you
 will
 how


confident
 are
 you
 that
 your
 voice
 will


produce
 a
 gain
 not
 very
 and
 when
 will


that
 gain
 occur
 well
 sometime
 down
 the


road
 now
 if
 you
 because
 you're
 not
 quite


sure
 stay
 silent
 who
 gains
 you
 do
 right


you
 stay
 you
 stay
 safe
 and
 comfortable


for
 another
 minute
 when
 does
 that
 gain


happen
 immediately
 how
 confident
 are
 you


that
 your
 silence
 won't
 produce
 a
 bad


outcome
 100%
 so
 that's
 a
 pretty
 profound


asymmetry
 you
 know
 when
 you
 think
 about


it
 you
 realize
 that
 leaders
 actually


have
 to
 go
 on
 a
 treasure
 hunt
 because


otherwise
 the
 risk
 reward
 count
 calculus


will
 get
 you
 every
 time
 and
 and
 I
 think


the
 other
 um
 the
 other
 is
 the
 asymmetry


between
 um
 the
 the
 good
 and
 bad


exchanges
 right
 so
 if
 I
 have
 U
 you
 know


and
 maybe
 it
 happens
 rarely
 but
 if
 I


have
 a
 bad
 a
 bad
 reaction
 to
 my
 taking
 a


risk
 and
 speaking
 up
 and
 someone
 is


dismissive
 or
 judgmental
 or
 you
 know


even
 um
 you
 know
 downright
 humiliates
 me


I
 will
 not
 try
 again
 for
 a
 quite
 some


some
 time
 whereas
 if
 I
 have
 a
 good


response
 it
 won't
 sort
 of
 preclude
 me


from
 trying
 again
 but
 it
 doesn't


necessarily
 make
 it
 that
 much
 easier
 it


just
 doesn't
 make
 it
 harder
 right
 so


again
 the
 degree
 to
 which
 I'm
 willing
 to


try
 again
 goes
 vastly
 down
 if
 I
 have
 you


know
 one
 humiliating
 moment
 and
 so
 given


you
 know
 given
 those
 those
 sort
 of


asymmetries
 you
 have
 to
 um
 you
 have
 to


sort
 of
 I
 guess
 I
 guess
 I'm
 just


answering
 your
 question
 wholeheart
 ly


which
 is
 you
 are


vulnerable
 yeah
 makes
 sense
 I
 think
 I


think
 we
 all
 can
 relate
 to
 that
 as
 well


so
 so
 one
 misunderstanding


or
 uh
 or
 what
 what
 we
 ended
 up
 uh


realizing
 sometimes
 is
 that
 people
 when


we
 talk
 a
 bit
 about
 psychological
 safety


we
 have
 to
 open
 the
 box
 a
 bit
 and
 then


we
 talk
 about
 it
 and
 then
 people
 may
 be


miss
 the
 point
 so
 they're
 trying
 to
 make


it
 comfortable
 but
 for
 no
 particular


reason
 performance
 wise
 so
 like
 you
 get


points
 for
 making
 it
 safe
 but
 like
 you


forget
 to
 to
 draw
 the
 link
 between
 that


what's
 what's
 your
 advice
 for
 those


misunderstandings
 yeah
 yeah
 I
 mean
 I


think
 my
 my
 advice
 is
 again
 to
 to
 not


again
 but
 to
 come
 to
 come
 to
 that
 um


constant
 sort
 of
 appreciation
 of
 the


knowledge
 intensive
 really
 intellectual


work
 that
 you
 do
 um
 you
 know
 and
 that's


that's
 different
 from
 say
 high-risk
 work


in
 a
 you
 know
 in
 a
 a
 power
 plant
 or
 an


aluminum
 plant
 or
 something
 like
 that


but
 there
 is
 some
 there
 are
 some
 ways
 in


which
 you
 have
 it
 in
 common
 which
 is


that
 both
 require
 a
 sense
 of
 of
 of


vigilance
 of
 very
 um
 thoughtful


conscious
 interrelationships
 with
 others


I'm
 interrelating
 meaning
 I
 want
 to


listen
 to
 you
 closely
 I
 want
 you
 to


listen
 to
 me
 closely
 we
 want
 people
 to


be
 paying
 attention
 um
 and
 doesn't
 mean


you
 have
 to
 be
 you
 know
 completely
 on


all
 the
 time
 there
 are
 breaks
 of
 course


and
 there
 are
 you
 know
 we
 we
 want
 people


to
 you
 know
 leave
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


go
 for
 a
 run
 whatever
 you
 know
 whatever


works
 for
 you
 but
 but
 that
 that
 sense
 of


awareness
 that
 the
 knowledge
 intensive


intellectual
 work
 you
 do
 requires
 a
 kind


of
 um
 alertness
 and
 an
 and
 an
 engagement


to
 do
 it
 well
 um
 and
 you
 know
 what
 what


allows
 people
 in
 high-risk
 Industries
 to


perform
 well
 and
 to
 avoid
 sort
 of


catastrophic
 accidents
 or
 worker
 uh


accidents
 is
 not
 a
 kind
 of


um
 I
 don't
 know
 a
 blind
 spot
 about


failure
 but
 quite
 the
 opposite
 it's
 like


a
 almost
 a
 preoccupation
 with
 failure


they
 are
 aware
 you
 know
 that
 around


every
 corner
 is
 a
 potentially
 fatal


accident
 and
 because
 of
 that
 they
 sort


of
 bring
 their
 aame
 to
 the
 moment
 to
 the


moments
 that
 need
 it
 and
 all
 I'm


suggesting
 is
 you
 can
 bring
 your
 aame
 to


the
 moments
 that
 need
 it
 and
 it
 it's
 it


requires
 um
 vigilance
 it
 requires
 a


little
 bravery
 you
 know
 it
 requires
 just


kind
 of
 an
 appreciation
 for
 for
 what's


at


stake
 all
 right
 thanks
 for
 sharing
 that


isn't
 it


interesting
 us
 nerding
 about
 you
 know
 on


the
 psychological
 safety
 part
 so
 guess


what
 Amy
 has
 written
 this
 great
 book
 I


just
 finished
 it
 uh
 the
 right
 kind
 of


wrongs
 is
 the
 name
 is
 a
 book
 about


failures
 way
 great
 fun
 what


fun
 so
 so
 you
 separate
 so
 so
 I
 think


sometimes
 having
 a
 language
 around


failures
 and
 doing
 things
 wrong
 is
 like


digging
 or
 have
 some
 more
 Precision
 to


it
 and
 you
 you
 have
 an
 interesting
 um


separation
 between
 basic
 complex
 and


intelligent
 failures
 can
 you
 clarify
 bit


sure
 sure
 so
 a
 basic
 failure
 is
 a


failure
 that
 occurs
 in
 familiar


territory
 usually
 because
 of
 human
 error


just
 a


single
 dumb
 mistake
 leads
 to
 a
 b
 basic


failure
 for
 instance
 in
 2021
 a
 City
 Bank


employee
 accidentally
 checked
 the
 wrong


box
 in
 an
 online
 form
 and
 accidentally


transferred
 $900
 million
 to
 a
 group
 of


lenders
 right
 and
 then
 later
 a
 judge
 uh


made
 a
 controversial
 ruling
 that
 did
 not


allow
 City
 Bank
 to
 reclaim
 those
 funds


right
 so
 that
 was
 a
 single
 human
 error


maybe
 not
 paying
 attention
 maybe
 not


well
 trained
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 led
 to
 a


failure
 that
 we
 would
 all
 consider


fairly
 sizable
 that
 was
 nonetheless


basic
 so
 basic
 doesn't
 mean
 small
 or
 big


you
 know
 it's
 a
 basic
 failure
 when
 you


forget
 to
 charge
 your
 phone
 and
 you
 know


Miss
 a
 meeting
 whatever
 but
 some
 of
 them


are
 big
 some
 of
 them
 are
 small
 basic


complex
 failures
 are
 ones
 with
 um
 the


perfect
 storms
 they're
 the
 they're
 the


failures
 that
 inevitably
 happen


in
 you
 know
 relatively
 familiar


territory
 when
 a
 handful
 of
 small
 all


deviations
 from
 best
 practice
 come


together
 in
 just
 the
 wrong
 way
 to
 create


a
 failure
 a
 supply
 chain
 breakdown
 in
 a


global
 pandemic
 for
 instance
 again
 basic


failures
 can
 be
 I
 mean
 complex
 failures


can
 be
 small
 or
 large
 but
 there
 the
 what


makes
 what's
 different
 is
 that
 any
 one


of
 those
 factors
 on
 its
 own
 those
 small


deviations
 wouldn't
 produce
 a
 failure
 it


it
 was
 The
 Perfect
 Storm
 the
 way
 they


came
 together
 neither
 basic
 nor
 complex


failures
 are
 worthy
 of
 Celebration
 right


they're
 not
 useful
 like
 when
 we're
 at


our
 best
 we
 can
 prevent
 them
 I
 mean
 some


of
 them
 will
 slip
 through
 I
 understand


that
 and
 that's
 okay
 we're
 human
 but


when
 we're
 at
 our
 best
 we
 don't
 need
 to


have
 those
 they
 they
 bring
 us
 learning


but
 not
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 new
 learning
 in


contrast
 what
 I
 call
 intelligent


failures
 are
 those
 that
 uh
 explicitly


occur
 in
 New
 Territory
 they
 are
 the


undesired
 results
 of
 thoughtful


experiments
 so
 a
 failure
 for
 a
 failure


to
 be
 intelligent
 um
 we
 must
 not
 yet


have
 the
 knowledge
 we
 need
 to
 get
 the


result
 we
 want
 so
 it's
 new
 territory


much
 of
 your
 work
 is
 in
 New
 Territory
 by


definition
 yeah
 it's
 in
 pursuit
 of
 a


goal
 whether
 that's
 making
 money
 or
 you


know
 mastering
 a
 a
 skill
 or
 making
 a


scientific
 discovery
 you
 have
 a
 goal


number
 three
 it
 is
 um
 hypothesis
 driven


you've
 you've
 you've
 taken
 the
 time
 to


figure
 out
 what
 we
 know
 what
 we
 don't


know
 and
 you've
 made
 a
 good
 bet
 and
 then


finally
 for
 a
 failure
 to
 be
 intelligent


it
 should
 not
 be
 any
 larger
 than


necessary
 to
 get
 the
 new
 knowledge
 right


so
 this
 is
 what
 scientists
 do
 every
 day


uh
 but
 I
 would
 argue
 in
 your
 business


you
 are
 doing
 this
 uh
 as
 well
 athletes


also
 do
 this
 yeah
 trying
 to
 yeah
 trying


to
 get
 into
 new
 territory
 uh
 you're


stretching
 and
 it
 doesn't
 always
 work


yeah
 so
 uh
 new
 territory
 we
 need
 to
 take


risk
 and
 we
 should
 celebrate
 it


because
 we
 don't
 know
 it's
 hard
 to
 yeah


you
 have
 to
 train
 yourself
 to
 say
 Okay


that
 was
 disappointing
 and
 it's
 still


valuable
 right
 it
 brings
 us
 something
 we


did
 not
 know
 before
 yeah
 and
 all


territory
 so
 we
 we're
 all
 human
 beings


we
 had
 some
 erors
 small
 today
 you
 know


things
 happen
 uh
 we
 should
 uh
 get
 them


out
 in
 in
 the
 open
 so
 we
 can
 identify


them
 learn
 from
 them
 and
 maybe
 who
 knows


we
 might
 even
 prevent
 them
 next
 time
 but


uh
 yes
 yeah
 exactly
 so
 that's
 useful


just
 uh
 before
 we
 run
 out
 of
 time
 here


um
 Amy
 so
 um
 we
 see
 that
 in
 this


Marathon
 sport
 um
 you
 become
 world


champions
 of
 uh
 committing
 mistakes
 or


doing
 doing
 something
 wrong
 and
 yeah
 so


but
 so
 you
 want
 to
 focus
 on
 the
 on
 the


wins
 right
 but
 I
 can
 see
 it
 takes
 a
 toll


on
 quite
 a
 few
 people
 any
 advice
 this
 is


I
 suppose
 this
 is
 my
 job
 but
 uh
 any


advice
 yeah
 uh
 how
 can
 people
 travel


light
 but
 still
 remain
 their
 heart


because
 we're
 long
 term
 we
 want
 people


to


last
 be
 I
 think
 it's
 you
 know
 part
 of
 it


is
 having
 a
 a
 more
 you
 know
 training


yourself
 to
 have
 a
 more
 rational


response
 to
 the
 disappointments
 I
 and
 I


think
 we
 have
 a
 natural
 response
 that's


quite
 emotional
 and
 we
 believe
 you
 know


at
 some
 level
 We
 Believe
 well
 that


shouldn't
 have
 happened
 and
 it's
 it
 it


it
 it
 exhausts
 us
 in
 a
 way
 to
 think
 that


way
 and
 when
 we
 learn
 to
 Master
 the


pause
 you
 know
 just
 insert
 that
 space


between
 the
 stimulus
 and
 our
 response
 we


can
 then
 think


more
 rationally
 about
 the
 situation
 okay


that's
 disappointing
 and
 what
 do
 we


learn
 from
 it
 what
 actually
 happened
 and


how
 do
 we
 use
 it
 uh
 to
 go
 forward
 it's
 a


it's
 almost
 a
 Relentless
 forward
 F
 Focus


we
 care
 about
 the
 past
 because
 the
 past


is
 full
 of
 learnings
 but
 our
 our
 our


focus
 is
 on
 on
 the
 future
 and
 and
 what


do
 we
 do
 with
 all
 that
 valuable
 learning


that's
 good
 advice
 I
 just
 have
 an
 After


Burner
 I
 need
 to
 ask
 you
 Amy
 uh
 this


psychological
 safety
 really
 strike
 the


chord
 researchers
 applied
 PR


practitioners
 organizations
 have
 used
 it


to
 become
 better
 where
 are
 the
 herds


going
 in
 social
 sciences
 now
 do
 you


think
 you
 know
 I
 I
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 really


know
 it
 seems
 to
 me
 all
 any
 anyone
 can


talk
 about
 is
 AI
 so
 maybe
 it's
 AI
 nudges


that
 help
 us
 Master
 the
 pause
 that
 help


us
 you
 know
 sort
 of
 be
 brave
 uh
 be
 more


rational
 I
 don't
 know
 but
 um
 we'll
 we'll


have
 to
 just
 wait
 and
 see
 this
 was
 great


Amy
 thanks
 for
 joining
 us
 by
 thanks
 for


having
 me
 thank


[Applause]


you
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 Amy
 and
 for
 that


really
 interesting
 conversation
 we
 are


continuing
 on
 the
 topic
 of
 what
 makes
 a


great
 investment
 organization
 and
 we


will
 now
 hear
 from
 Robert
 Wallace
 of
 the


Stanford
 management
 company
 where
 he


oversees
 the
 University's
 endowment


portfolio
 of
 roughly
 40
 billion


US
 now
 Rob
 is
 no
 ordinary
 investor


indeed
 before
 his
 career
 in
 Investment


Management
 he
 was
 a
 professional
 ballet


dancer
 with
 the
 Boston
 Ballet
 the


Washington
 ballet
 and
 the
 American


Ballet
 Theater
 now
 I'm
 not
 sure
 if
 Rob


is
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 what
 the


Performing
 Artist
 could
 have
 taught
 us


in
 building
 successful
 investment


management
 organization
 but
 we
 are


certainly
 looking
 forward
 to
 hearing
 you


thank


[Applause]


you
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 that
 very


kind
 two
 kind
 introduction
 Tron
 it's


very
 nice
 to
 be
 with
 you
 uh
 today
 and
 uh


I'm
 going
 to
 share
 with
 you
 a
 framework


that
 I
 often
 use
 at
 at
 Stanford


University
 when
 I
 think
 about
 managing


the
 Stanford
 endowment
 and
 it
 really


focuses
 on
 three
 things
 that
 we
 have
 to


do
 right
 we
 have
 to
 do
 well
 if
 we
 want


to
 be
 successful
 in
 the
 long
 in
 the
 long


run
 for
 Stanford
 I
 call
 them
 the
 three


pillars
 of
 investment
 success
 they
 are


strategy
 execution
 and
 governance
 so
 I'm


going
 to
 talk
 about
 each
 one
 of
 those


briefly
 and
 then
 I'll
 finish
 with
 uh


sharing
 some
 of
 our
 long-term
 uh


investment
 results
 with
 you
 but
 before
 I


start
 just
 to
 orient
 ourselves
 maybe


I'll
 I'll
 mention
 a
 couple
 highle
 facts


about
 Stanford
 so
 Stanford
 University
 is


a
 research
 University
 located
 in
 Palo


Alto
 California
 about
 1
 hour
 south
 of


San
 Francisco
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 what's


sometimes
 referred
 to
 as
 Silicon
 Valley


in
 fact
 the
 technology
 ecosystem
 that
 is


Silicon
 Valley
 really
 built
 itself


around
 Stanford
 over
 the
 last
 50
 or
 60


years
 and
 important
 companies
 like


Google
 were
 actually
 uh
 started
 on
 the


Stanford
 campus
 the
 University
 was


founded
 in
 the
 late
 1800s
 uh
 and


unusually
 at
 the
 time
 it
 was
 founded
 as


a
 co-educational
 school
 so
 the
 very


first
 class
 that
 matriculated
 at


Stanford
 had
 both
 men
 and
 women
 in
 it


today
 there's
 7,000
 undergraduates
 at


Stanford
 10,000
 graduate
 students
 and


2,300
 faculty
 members
 the
 endowment
 as


as
 Tron
 just
 uh
 mentioned
 is
 about
 $40


billion
 and
 this
 year
 it
 will
 distribute


to
 the
 operating
 budget
 of
 of
 the


University
 $2
 billion
 so
 that
 is
 the


single
 largest
 line
 item
 in
 Stanford's


$9
 billion
 operating
 budget
 so
 that


brings
 me
 to
 the
 first
 thing
 that
 you


need
 to
 do
 right
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 a


successful
 long-term
 investor
 and
 that's


strategy
 and
 here's
 a
 quote
 from
 the


great
 Norwegian
 polar
 Explorer
 almanson


Victory
 awaits
 him
 who
 has
 everything
 in


order
 people
 call
 it
 luck
 what
 a
 nice


succinct
 way
 to
 talk
 about
 strategy
 you


have
 a
 goal
 you
 need
 to
 build
 a
 plan
 a


strategy
 to
 achieve
 your
 goal


we
 have
 two
 key
 goals
 for
 the
 Stanford


endowment
 one
 we
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 be
 a


material
 part
 of
 the
 of
 the
 life
 the


academic
 life
 of
 the
 current
 generation


of
 students
 and
 Scholars
 at
 Stanford
 so


I
 mentioned
 roughly
 $2
 billion
 flowing


from
 the
 endowment
 this
 year
 it's
 about


5%
 of
 the
 value
 of
 the
 endowment
 that's


goal
 number
 one
 goal
 number
 two
 is
 we


want
 to
 be
 as
 at
 least
 as
 impactful
 and


supportive
 for
 all
 future
 generations
 of


students
 and
 Scholars
 at
 Stanford
 so


that
 introduces
 a
 concept
 that
 we
 call


the
 presid
 conservation
 of
 purchasing


power
 so
 that
 just
 means
 that
 if
 you're


spending
 5%
 every
 year
 from
 your


endowment
 you
 have
 to
 earn
 back
 at
 least


that
 5%
 but
 you'll
 also
 have
 to
 earn


enough
 to
 offset
 the
 impacts
 of


inflation
 the
 inflation
 that
 we
 care


about
 at
 Stanford
 is
 higher
 education


price
 inflation
 which
 tends
 to
 run
 a


little
 bit
 higher
 than
 Consumer
 Price


inflation
 so
 if
 CPI
 runs
 at
 2
 to
 3%
 over


40
 or
 50
 years
 higher
 education
 price


inflation
 is
 going
 to
 run
 at
 3
 to
 4%
 so


when
 you
 put
 5%
 of
 payout
 together
 with


4%
 inflation
 you
 you
 have
 a
 pretty
 high


you
 need
 to
 have
 a
 pretty
 high
 uh


expected
 return
 to
 offset
 uh
 your


spending
 and
 still
 preserve
 the


purchasing
 power
 of
 the
 endowment
 so
 the


way
 that
 we
 do
 that
 is
 we
 have
 an
 equity


bias
 in
 the
 portfolio
 equities
 have
 a


higher
 expected
 return
 than
 fixed
 income


or
 cash
 and
 that's
 really
 important
 in


the
 long
 run
 if
 you
 want
 to
 achieve
 that


second
 goal
 unfortunately
 as
 we
 all
 know


equities
 are
 very
 risky
 you
 rank
 the


lowest
 priority
 in
 the
 capital
 structure


it's
 much
 more
 uh
 possible
 to
 lose
 your


capital
 and
 have
 a
 capital
 impairment


equities
 are
 also
 very
 price
 volatile


and
 volatility
 is
 not
 not
 the
 only
 risk


that
 you
 care
 about
 it's
 not
 even
 uh
 you


know
 maybe
 not
 even
 the
 main
 risk
 but
 it


is
 a
 risk
 and
 the
 reason
 that
 it
 is
 is
 a


risk
 is
 because
 unnecessary
 or
 extra


volatility
 work
 will
 that
 you're
 not


being
 paid
 for
 will
 erode
 your
 long-term


compound
 return
 so
 to
 make
 this
 clear


with
 a
 simple
 example
 if
 you
 start
 with


$100
 and
 you
 have
 a
 50%
 return
 in
 year
 2


and
 a
 negative
 50%
 return
 sorry
 50%


return
 in
 year
 1
 and
 a
 negative
 50%


return
 in
 year
 two
 where
 do
 you
 end
 up


well
 at
 the
 end
 of
 year
 one
 your
 $100


has
 become
 150
 and
 then
 in
 year
 two
 you


lose
 50%
 it
 becomes
 75
 so
 you're
 up
 50


down
 50
 but
 you've
 just
 lost
 25%
 of
 your


money
 so
 volatility
 erodes
 longterm


compound
 returns
 you
 can
 see
 that
 with


the
 identity
 shown
 on
 the
 bottom
 of
 the


slide
 whenever
 volatility
 is
 greater


than
 zero
 your
 geometric
 or
 your


compound
 return
 will
 be
 lower
 than
 your


single
 period
 expected
 arithmetic
 return


so
 how
 do
 we
 deal
 with
 that
 extra
 risk


we
 diversify
 we
 look
 for
 something
 that


Noel
 Lauri
 at
 Harry
 Marco
 it's
 called


the
 free
 lunch
 so
 we
 own
 different
 types


of
 equities
 we
 own
 some
 equities
 in
 the


United
 States
 some
 equities
 in
 Europe


some
 equities
 in
 Asia
 some
 that
 are


purely
 corporate
 so
 think
 of
 venture


capital
 some
 that
 are
 backed
 by
 physical


assets
 so
 think
 of
 real
 estate
 and
 when


we
 put
 those
 uh
 equities
 together
 they


are
 positively
 correlated
 with
 each


other
 but
 they're
 not
 perfectly


correlated
 so
 we
 they
 react
 somewhat


differently
 to
 different
 macroeconomic


states
 of
 the
 world
 so
 we're
 starting
 to


gain
 some
 stability
 through
 that


diversification
 then
 we
 introduced
 two


other
 asset
 classes
 fixed
 income
 and


absolute
 return
 which
 is
 a
 collection
 of


carefully
 chosen
 um
 relative
 value


strategies
 from
 the
 hedge
 fund
 world
 and


we
 put
 them
 together
 with
 the
 equity
 uh


asset
 classes
 in
 our
 portfolio
 we
 we
 end


up
 with
 a
 portfolio
 designed
 to
 give
 us


a
 pretty
 high
 expected
 return
 but
 with


uh
 with
 uh
 with
 low
 levels
 of
 volatility


or
 reasonable
 levels
 of
 volatility
 this


is
 our
 policy
 asset
 allocation
 at


Stanford
 right
 now
 so
 this
 is
 the
 the


most
 succinct
 way
 that
 I
 can
 explain
 our


strategy
 down
 the
 left
 hand
 side
 you
 can


see
 all
 the
 major
 asset
 classes
 as
 we


Define
 them
 on
 the
 right
 you
 can
 see


their
 policy
 Target
 weights
 and


everything
 on
 this
 slide
 is
 an
 equity


oriented
 asset
 class
 except
 for
 those


two
 middle
 asset
 classes
 absolute
 return


and
 fixed
 income
 if
 you
 do
 the
 quick


math
 you
 can
 see
 that
 the
 equity
 asset


classes
 add
 up
 to
 about
 70%
 of
 the


portfolio
 so
 here
 you
 can
 see
 we're


designing
 a
 strategy
 to
 achieve
 our
 goal


this
 is
 an
 equity
 oriented
 portfolio
 yet


it
 has
 substantial
 levels
 of


diversification
 when
 we
 model
 this


portfolio
 it
 gives
 us
 an
 expected
 single


period
 return
 of
 88.3%
 so
 that's


deflated
 by
 higher
 education
 price


inflation
 expected
 volatility
 of
 15%
 on


an
 annual
 basis
 and
 that
 leads
 to
 a


compound
 return
 expectation
 of
 7.1%
 net


of
 net
 of
 inflation
 so
 if
 this
 is
 true


if
 we
 designed
 the
 if
 we
 specified
 the


portfolio
 correctly
 and
 we
 achieve
 a
 7%


real
 return
 we
 can
 pay
 out
 5%
 a
 year
 or


even
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 and
 still


preserve
 their
 purchasing
 power
 of
 the


Endowment
 for
 future


Generations
 the
 next
 key
 pillar
 that
 we


have
 to
 get
 right
 is
 execution
 and
 this


is
 one
 of
 my
 favorite
 quotes
 from
 the


American
 inventor
 Thomas
 Edison


opportunity
 is
 missed
 by
 most
 people


because
 it
 become
 it
 comes
 dressed
 in


overalls
 and
 looks
 like
 work
 and
 this


really
 is
 what
 we
 do
 most
 days
 at


Stanford
 management
 company
 we
 execute


against
 the
 strategy
 that
 I
 just
 showed


you
 so
 execution
 has
 a
 couple
 parts
 the


first
 is
 portfolio
 management
 so
 every


day
 we
 get
 a
 flash
 estimate
 of
 where
 the


portfolio
 is
 it
 comes
 out
 about
 7:30


a.m.
 and
 we
 may
 start
 to
 make
 one
 of
 two


types
 of
 actions
 the
 first
 is
 we
 may


rebalance
 the
 portfolio
 between
 asset


classes
 so
 as
 Market
 movements
 take


those
 asset
 classes
 away
 from
 their


policy
 weights
 the
 the
 the
 risk
 return


and
 liquidity
 characteristics
 of
 the


portfolio
 start
 to
 shift
 from
 what
 we


think
 is
 ideal
 so
 we
 will
 normally
 sell


what's
 gone
 up
 in
 value
 and
 bring
 it


back
 down
 to
 Target
 and
 we'll
 buy
 what's


gone
 down
 in
 value
 and
 bring
 it
 back
 up


to
 Target
 and
 that
 way
 we
 preserve
 the


right
 risk
 return
 for
 the
 portfolio


going
 forward
 so
 that's
 rebalancing


sometimes
 we
 rebalance
 once
 a
 week
 or


once
 every
 two
 weeks
 in
 volatile
 Capital


Market
 environments
 we
 may
 rebalance


every


day
 the
 second
 type
 of
 portfolio


management
 that
 we
 conduct
 is
 rotating


Capital
 inside
 of
 asset
 classes
 so
 I


should
 take
 a
 moment
 and
 explain
 that


the
 security
 level
 decisions
 for
 the


Stanford
 endowment
 are
 made
 by
 external


partners
 that
 we
 find
 we
 identify
 we
 try


to
 build
 long-term
 relationships
 these


are
 very
 specialist
 Partners
 very
 very


good
 at
 what
 they
 do
 whether
 it's
 stock


picking
 or
 venture
 capital
 or
 private


real
 estate
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 find
 these


partners
 and
 I'll
 talk
 about
 that
 in
 a


minute
 but
 once
 we
 have
 found
 them
 we


have
 a
 strong
 trustful
 communication
 and


when
 their
 opportunity
 set
 evolves
 we


can
 take
 some
 action
 to
 optimize


Stanford's
 Capital
 so
 if
 their


opportunity
 set
 gets
 more
 attractive
 we


can
 give
 them
 more
 money
 if
 it
 gets
 a


little
 bit
 less
 attractive
 we
 can
 take


some
 money
 back
 so
 we're
 always
 doing


that
 the
 combination
 of
 rebalancing


between
 asset
 classes
 and
 rotating


Capital
 within
 an
 asset
 class
 can


sometimes
 take
 up
 30
 40
 or
 even
 50%
 of


the
 value
 of
 the
 endowment
 in
 a
 single


year
 so
 they're
 very
 we're
 very
 active


in
 managing
 the
 portfolio


so
 I
 mentioned
 external
 Partners
 this
 is


a
 really
 critical
 part
 of
 execution
 uh


and
 a
 huge
 part
 of
 what
 we
 spend
 time
 on


at
 Stanford
 management
 company
 these
 are


generally
 speaking
 pretty
 small
 Niche


Boutique
 investment
 firms
 that
 we
 find


they're
 very
 principally
 oriented
 you


probably
 wouldn't
 know
 the
 names
 of
 most


of
 them
 um
 and
 I'll
 tell
 you
 what
 we


look
 for
 when
 we
 when
 we
 when
 we
 when
 we


go
 looking
 for
 new
 partners
 first
 of
 all


we
 want
 to
 see
 discipline
 we
 want
 to
 see


partners
 that
 understand
 the
 difference


between
 investment
 and
 spe
 ulation


understand
 that
 some
 things
 can
 be


analyzed
 with
 a
 high
 degree
 of
 rigor
 and


some
 things
 can't
 be
 and
 we
 want
 them
 to


focus
 their
 investment
 work
 on
 the


former
 and
 not
 the
 latter
 we
 want
 them


to
 have
 a
 strong
 thorough
 and
 repeatable


process
 something
 that
 we
 can
 see
 and


feel
 in
 touch
 that
 surfaces
 all
 the
 hard


and
 soft
 variables
 that
 they
 need
 to


think
 about
 in
 any
 given
 situation
 and


then
 finally
 we
 wanted
 them
 to
 take
 all


that
 data
 and
 apply
 Superior
 investment


judgment
 that's
 the
 hardest
 part
 for
 us


to
 sus
 out
 when
 we're
 meeting
 with
 a
 new


partner
 um
 really
 how
 do
 they
 assess


risk
 and
 return
 what
 kind
 of
 weights
 do


they
 put
 on
 the
 various
 parts
 of
 their


investment
 thesis
 and
 usually
 when
 we


make
 a
 mistake
 about
 a
 partner
 it's


usually
 that
 we
 we
 get
 their
 uh


investment
 judgment
 uh
 wrong
 we
 like
 it


when
 our
 partners
 have
 the
 appropriate


amount
 of


capital
 so
 investment
 success
 often


leads
 people
 to
 have
 too
 much
 Capital


they
 kind
 of
 outgrow
 their
 competitive


Sweet
 Spot
 it's
 very
 common
 we'd
 like
 it


when
 that
 happens
 that
 our
 partners


return
 capital
 to
 us
 and
 so
 it's
 really


important
 that
 that
 size
 doesn't
 become


the
 enemy
 of
 performance
 in
 our


portfolio
 and
 finally
 we
 we
 try
 to


structure
 a
 a
 strong
 economic
 alignment


of
 Interest
 with
 our
 partners
 so
 are
 we


compensating
 them
 appropriately
 over
 the


right
 time
 Horizon
 over
 the
 right
 cost


of
 capital
 are
 they
 putting
 their
 money


alongside
 us
 uh
 so
 that
 we're
 eating
 the


same
 cooking
 do
 they
 do
 well
 when
 they


do
 well
 for
 Stanford
 these
 are
 all


important
 parts
 of
 what
 makes
 a


successful
 long-term
 relationship
 I


should
 also
 mentioned
 at
 Stanford
 that


we
 believe
 long-term
 investment
 success


requires
 an
 appropriate
 regard
 for
 human


and
 environmental
 welfare
 so
 we
 insist


that
 our
 partners
 have
 that
 same


philosophy
 that
 philosophical
 alignment


of
 interest
 is
 just
 as
 important
 as
 the


economic
 this
 slide
 sort
 of
 gives
 you


some
 data
 on
 why
 partner
 selection
 or


security
 selection
 is
 so
 important
 we're


looking
 at
 leverage
 buyout
 funds
 from


the
 United
 States
 uh
 formed
 between
 2000


and
 2001
 and
 20
 thou
 2020
 so
 these
 are


reasonably
 mature
 buyout
 funds
 the
 top


dated
 line
 line
 is
 the
 top
 fifth


percentile
 buyout
 result
 for
 that
 year


the
 bottom
 line
 is
 the
 bottom
 fifth


percentile
 and
 the
 and
 the
 median
 is


shown
 in
 the
 solid
 line
 in
 the
 middle
 so


one
 thing
 immediately
 jumps
 out
 from
 the


slide
 if
 you're
 in
 the
 top
 of
 the


distribution
 if
 you're
 in
 the
 top
 fifth


percentile
 of
 the
 leverage
 buyout


Universe
 in
 the
 United
 States
 you're


outperforming
 a
 median
 by
 around
 20


points
 per
 year
 these
 are
 net
 annual


irrs
 so
 20
 points
 per
 year
 on
 a
 closed


end
 fund
 that's
 10
 or
 12
 years
 in
 in
 in


life
 is
 a
 really
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 so
 that's
 an


incredible
 outcome
 if
 you
 can
 be
 in
 the


top
 of
 the
 distribution
 the
 second
 thing


that
 jumps
 off
 the
 slide
 is
 look
 at
 how


bad
 you
 do
 if
 you're
 in
 the
 bottom
 of


the
 distribution
 if
 you're
 the
 bottom


fifth
 percentile
 you're
 underperforming


the
 median
 by
 20
 points
 per
 year
 you're


almost
 certainly
 ending
 up
 with
 a
 a


result
 that's
 that's
 uh
 that's
 below
 the


public
 markets
 that
 you
 could
 access
 for


you
 know
 very
 easily
 for
 low
 so
 this


slide
 really
 um
 is
 why
 execution
 is
 so


important
 if
 you
 have
 a
 complex
 strategy


like
 Stanford
 you
 have
 to
 feel
 certain


that
 you
 can
 be
 in
 the
 top
 of
 the


distribution
 in
 this
 type
 of
 asset
 class


I
 could
 show
 you
 similar
 slides
 for


Venture
 Capital
 it
 would
 be
 be
 even
 more


dramatic
 private
 real
 estate
 absolute


return
 strategies
 all
 of
 them
 show
 this


type
 of
 dispersion
 which
 means
 that
 you


really
 need
 to
 execute
 well
 if
 you
 have


the
 type
 of
 strategy
 that
 Stanford


has
 how
 do
 you
 execute
 well
 well
 you


have
 to
 have
 the
 right
 team
 so
 we
 uh
 we


look
 for
 we
 hire
 people
 that
 are
 very


intellectually
 curious
 we
 heard
 about


this
 from
 some
 of
 the
 early
 speakers


people
 that
 really
 want
 to
 continually


grow
 as
 investors
 that
 seek
 and
 accept
 a


high
 degree
 of
 personal
 accountability


for
 their
 work
 so
 I
 often
 tell
 our


analysts
 at
 Stanford
 management
 company


you
 are
 the
 Stanford
 endowment
 I
 I


really
 want
 them
 to
 internalize
 uh
 their


work
 for
 Stanford
 it
 helps
 that
 they're


motivated
 by
 Stanford's
 uh
 academic


Mission
 this
 is
 you
 know
 it's
 hard
 work


and
 and
 and
 and
 so
 having
 some


psychological
 benefit
 knowing
 that


you're
 doing
 something
 that
 is
 very


valuable
 for
 the
 world
 is
 really


important
 for
 the


team
 we
 also
 try
 to
 grow
 our
 own
 Talent


so
 we're
 often
 hiring
 right
 out
 of


Stanford
 undergraduate
 uh
 and
 and


training
 our
 own
 training
 our
 own


investment
 Professionals
 in
 fact
 I'm


joined
 today
 by
 my
 colleague
 TAA


Rosenberg
 who's
 an
 analyst
 in
 our
 office


TAA
 is
 was
 born
 and
 raised
 in


Oslo
 she
 went
 to
 Stanford
 undergraduate


and
 While
 She
 Was
 An
 undergraduate
 there


uh
 she
 took
 our
 class
 in
 economics
 that


we
 teach
 once
 a
 year
 and
 she
 became
 an


intern
 in
 our
 office
 after
 she
 got
 her


Master's
 Degree
 she
 joined
 us
 full-time


and
 so
 it's
 TAA
 is
 a
 great
 example
 of


someone
 who's
 intellectually
 curious


seeks
 and
 accepts
 a
 high
 degree
 of


personal
 accountability
 and
 is
 very


motivated
 by
 Stanford's
 Mission
 we're


delighted
 to
 have
 her
 on
 the
 team
 you


take
 the
 right
 people
 and
 you
 put
 them


in
 the
 right
 culture
 so
 we
 have
 a
 very


open
 collaborative
 culture
 I
 like
 to


think
 we're
 all
 in
 the
 same
 rowboat


pulling
 towards
 the
 same
 Shore
 we
 all


sit
 on
 the
 same
 open
 floor
 plan
 we
 try


to
 reduce
 bureaucracy
 we
 try
 to
 minimize


hierarchy
 that's
 a
 lot
 better
 for


communication
 it's
 a
 lot
 better
 for


training
 your
 Junior
 professionals
 and


it's
 also
 a
 lot
 more
 fun
 and
 having
 fun


is
 a
 really
 important
 part
 of
 long-term


success
 so
 the
 final
 final
 pillar
 of


investment
 success
 is
 governance
 and


this
 one
 is
 talked
 about
 less
 but
 it's


just
 as
 important
 here's
 a
 great
 quote


from
 another
 uh
 incredibly
 impressive


Norwegian
 polar
 Explorer
 nonon
 the


difficult
 is
 what
 takes
 a
 little
 time


the
 impossible
 is
 what
 takes
 a
 little


longer
 and
 this
 is
 a
 great
 quote
 about


governance
 so
 governance
 just
 as


important
 as
 the
 other
 two
 pillars
 and


good
 governance
 supports
 the
 disciplined


execution
 of
 the
 right
 strategy
 and
 this


is
 really
 critically
 important


particularly
 in
 times
 of
 Market
 extremes


so
 you
 can
 think
 of
 a
 time
 of
 extreme


Euphoria
 where
 there's
 some
 hot
 sector


some
 hot
 asset
 class
 of
 the
 day
 that's


dramatically
 outperforming
 everything


else
 and
 by
 definition
 your
 Diversified


portfolio
 will
 underperform
 that
 hot


sector
 and
 bad
 governance
 would
 would


say
 chase
 that
 sector
 always
 go
 with
 a


you
 know
 try
 to
 catch
 up
 with
 what's


performing
 well
 that's
 unlikely
 to
 work


out
 well
 over
 time
 and
 certainly
 would


entail
 taking
 a
 lot
 of
 risk
 the
 other


type
 of
 extreme
 is
 fear
 and
 panic
 so


think
 of
 the
 fall
 of
 2008
 when
 everybody


was
 selling
 every
 risky
 asset
 and
 trying


to
 raise
 cash
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do
 in


that
 environment
 if
 you
 were
 an


Institutional
 Investor
 was
 to
 buy
 the


things
 that
 people
 were
 selling
 buy
 the


things
 that
 had
 fallen
 40%
 50%
 60%
 and


sell
 the
 other
 stuff
 to
 rebalance
 your


portfolio
 to
 bring
 the
 desired
 risk
 and


return
 back
 to
 the
 portfolio
 on
 a
 go


forward
 basis
 so
 governance
 reinforces


the
 discipline
 execution
 of
 the
 right


strategy
 and
 shelters
 the
 management


team
 from
 external
 influences
 that
 might


make
 that
 very


hard
 okay
 so
 uh
 just
 uh
 to
 finish
 on


this
 one
 this
 is
 our
 long-term
 invest


investment
 uh
 results
 so
 if
 you
 had


taken
 so
 Sanford
 management
 company
 was


formed
 in
 1991
 to
 professionally
 manage


the
 endowment
 if
 you
 had
 taken
 $100
 in


1991
 and
 invested
 it
 in
 the
 endowment


portfolio
 you
 would
 have
 made
 32
 times


your
 money
 by
 the
 middle
 of
 last
 year


that's
 roughly
 double
 the
 result
 that


you
 would
 have
 achieved
 in
 a
 in
 the


typical
 uh
 us
 endowment
 uh
 fund
 and


roughly
 four
 times
 uh
 the
 result
 that


you
 would
 have
 achieved
 had
 you
 taken


that
 same
 $100
 and
 invested
 it
 in
 a
 7030


portfolio
 70%
 Global
 equities
 30%
 high


quality
 bonds
 so
 if
 you
 can
 if
 you
 form


the
 right
 strategy
 if
 you
 specify
 the


right
 strategy
 based
 on
 the
 goals
 that


matter
 to
 you
 if
 you
 have
 the
 ability
 to


execute
 on
 that
 strategy
 and
 then
 you


have
 good
 governance
 that
 protects
 you


from
 outside
 interference
 you
 can
 get
 uh


attractive
 long-term
 investment
 results


thank
 you
 very
 much


thanks
 so
 much
 Robert
 we
 really
 enjoyed


hearing
 from


you
 now
 that
 we've
 heard
 a
 little
 bit


about
 what
 makes
 successful
 investment


organizations
 it's
 time
 to
 shift
 our


Focus
 to
 those
 that
 make
 these


organizations
 successful
 the


investors
 what
 elements
 of
 psychology
 go


on
 to
 making
 better


investors
 what
 do
 in
 investors
 have
 in


common
 with
 professional


athletes
 let's
 see
 what
 our
 team


performance
 coach
 from
 nbim
 Bion


mansburg
 has
 to


say
 I
 don't
 believe
 in


miracles
 even
 though
 they
 sometimes


happen
 to
 the
 scoring


great
 performance
 comes
 from
 working


hard
 doing
 the
 right
 things
 and
 stop


doing
 the
 wrong
 ones
 sounds
 um
 easy


right
 through
 my
 whole
 life
 I've
 been


working
 with
 performance
 cultures
 as
 a


fighter
 pilot
 in
 the
 Air


Force
 with
 the
 best
 football
 team
 in


Norway
 and
 with
 some
 of
 the
 best


Financial
 investors
 in
 the
 world
 so
 what


is
 the
 common
 denominator
 for
 high


performers
 it
 is
 the
 way
 we
 as


individuals
 keep
 on
 strengthening
 and


regulating
 our


capacity
 always
 striving
 to
 learn


develop
 our
 skill
 sets
 and
 maintain
 a


conscious
 focus
 it
 is
 also
 the
 way
 we


interact
 with
 others
 sharing
 Lessons


Learned
 giving
 feedback
 exploiting
 our


diversity
 and
 taking
 risk


together
 bottom
 line
 it
 is
 your
 ability


to
 do
 what's
 right
 for
 you
 and
 your
 team


a
 sustainable
 high
 performance


organization
 is
 not
 a
 miracle
 it
 is
 hard


conscious
 work


[Music]


teamwork
 so
 in
 person
 um
 here
 today
 we


are
 so
 lucky
 to
 have
 Mark
 Rowan
 the


co-founder
 and
 current
 CEO
 of
 Apollo


Global


Management
 now
 not
 only
 is
 Mark
 a
 highly


successful
 investor
 he
 is
 also
 a


well-known
 philanthropist
 supporting


initiatives
 on
 projects
 within
 education


art
 and
 Healthcare
 so
 please
 welcome


Mark
 Rowan
 to
 the
 sage


[Applause]


[Music]


thank
 you
 and
 what
 amazing
 advice
 we


have
 all
 been
 the
 beneficiaries
 of
 not


just
 just
 most
 recently
 from
 Adam
 U
 but


this
 morning
 uh
 I
 thought
 I'd
 come
 at


this
 my
 own
 way
 um
 and
 when
 I
 tell
 my


organization
 don't
 be
 defensive
 be


curious
 change
 is
 a


constant
 we
 as
 investors
 we
 in
 financial


services
 I
 think
 have
 consistently


underestimated
 the
 impact
 of
 change


we've
 been
 resistant
 to
 change
 we've


denied
 change
 we
 stick
 to
 the
 status
 quo


and
 I
 thought
 I'd
 just
 maybe
 share
 some


examples
 of
 change
 and
 how
 impactful
 it


is
 so
 this
 is
 now
 my
 40th
 year
 doing


this
 and
 I
 tell
 my
 team
 I
 look
 back
 over


40
 years
 and
 when
 I
 started
 no
 highi
 old


bonds
 no
 leverage
 loans
 no
 ETFs
 minimal


securitized
 product
 now
 those
 four


products
 are
 incredibly
 dominant
 in
 our


financial
 landscape
 why
 do
 we
 think


they're
 going
 to
 be
 here
 in
 5
 or
 10


years
 why
 do
 we
 build
 investment


strategies
 on
 them
 are
 the
 circumstances


that
 allowed
 them
 to
 essentially
 take


hold
 still
 the
 circumstances


today
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 look
 back
 again


over
 40
 years
 and
 I
 think
 we've
 lived
 in


a
 period
 of
 Tailwinds
 for
 my
 career
 I


think
 I've
 live
 been
 very
 fortunate
 I


think
 most
 of
 you
 have
 been
 very


fortunate
 we've
 had
 four
 Tailwinds
 rates


have
 gone
 from
 high
 to


low
 we
 have
 printed
 an
 awful
 lot
 of


money
 we
 have
 borrowed
 forward
 future


demand
 through
 fiscal
 borrowing
 almost


everywhere
 in
 the
 world
 and
 we've
 had


the
 benefit
 of


globalization
 are
 any
 of
 those
 four


things


true
 going


forward
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 think
 there's
 a


healthy
 debate
 as
 to
 whether
 they
 are


headwinds
 but
 I
 would
 argue
 I
 think


we're
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 Tailwinds


why
 would
 we
 think
 the
 investment


strategies
 that
 work
 for
 the
 past
 40


years
 would
 work
 going
 forward
 is
 there


actually
 any
 value
 to
 track
 record
 over


the
 last
 10


years
 or
 should
 we
 just
 completely
 throw


it
 away
 we
 all
 as
 investors
 take
 great


comfort
 of
 looking
 at
 the
 last
 five


years
 the
 last
 10
 years
 what
 are
 the


chances
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 print
 in
 the


US
 another
 8
 trillion
 dollar
 and


everything
 will
 go
 up
 to
 the


right
 why
 would
 track
 record
 be
 relevant


you
 know
 I
 think
 I
 healthy
 skepticism


you
 were
 in
 2019
 the
 best
 investor
 in


the
 world
 you
 left
 Norway
 and
 you
 moved


to
 Austin
 Texas
 and
 all
 you
 bought
 in


Austin
 Texas
 was
 multif
 family
 and
 you


bought
 multif
 family
 in
 all
 the
 right


locations
 and
 your
 buildings
 are
 now


100%
 occupied
 your
 rents
 have
 been


growing
 10%
 a
 year
 you
 took
 out
 your
 60%


mortgage
 at
 3
 and
 a
 half%
 you
 were


feeling
 great
 you
 were
 the
 best
 investor


in
 the


world
 what's
 your
 Equity
 worth
 today


it's
 a
 math

 you
 a
 good

 well
 in


19
 you
 were
 a
 really
 good
 investor
 in
 20


you
 were
 a
 good
 investor
 in
 21
 people


were
 not
 so
 sure
 in
 22
 you
 went
 to
 the


bottom
 of
 the
 B
 and
 in
 23
 people
 are


pretty
 convinced
 you
 were
 lucky
 not


smart
 maybe
 we
 should
 use
 the
 words


Enterprise
 software
 instead
 of
 Austin


Texas
 maybe
 we've
 been
 living
 in


tailwind
 and
 we
 have
 to
 learn
 to
 accept


change


I
 know
 in
 my
 organization
 a
 lot
 of
 the


things
 that
 Adam
 just
 said
 uh
 we
 do


there's
 active
 encouragement
 of


intellectual
 insubordination
 which
 I


distinguish
 from
 outright


insubordination
 because
 that
 makes
 it


difficult
 to
 run
 the
 business
 but
 there


is
 no
 hierarchy
 for
 a
 good
 idea
 there
 is


no
 ability
 uh
 to
 feel
 uncomfortable
 this


is
 something
 we
 actively
 promote
 um
 I


gathered
 U
 my
 partners
 um
 in
 Abu
 Dhabi


in
 January
 every
 couple
 of
 years
 we
 get


together
 and
 we
 talk
 about
 the
 future


and
 I
 started
 with
 uh
 Apollo
 in
 2008


Apollo
 in
 2008
 was
 40
 billion
 of


AUM
 Apollo
 in
 2023
 was
 650
 billion
 of


AUM
 we
 had
 grew
 14
 times
 we
 outgrew


Apple
 we
 outgrew
 Microsoft
 I
 think
 we


outgrew
 everyone
 other
 than
 Nvidia
 by


the
 way
 all


organic
 next
 question
 were
 we
 lucky
 or


smart
 come
 on
 you
 guys
 know
 this
 we
 were


lucky
 you
 can't
 possibly
 you
 can't


possibly
 expect
 to
 grow
 a
 financial


services
 business
 at
 14
 times
 we
 were


smart
 only
 in
 that
 we
 were
 in
 the
 right


place
 to
 prepare
 for


Change
 and
 change
 happened
 think
 about


the
 trends
 that
 drove
 us
 from
 40
 billion


of
 AUM
 to
 650
 billion
 of
 AUM
 financial


crisis
 in
 2008
 weakened
 most
 financial


institutions
 they
 were
 playing
 defense


rates
 going
 to
 zero
 pushed
 investors
 who


had
 made
 promises
 to
 retirees
 to
 look


for


Alternatives
 those
 are
 the
 factors
 that


drove
 our
 growth
 and
 so
 sitting
 in
 the


beginning
 of


2024
 I'm
 looking
 out
 and
 I'm
 saying
 to


myself
 what
 where's
 change
 coming
 from


how
 do
 we
 first
 accept
 that
 the
 success


that
 we've
 had
 is
 based
 on
 a
 series
 of


things
 that
 no
 longer
 exist
 how
 do
 we


prepare
 the
 organization
 and
 to
 accept


change
 what
 happens
 if
 we're
 wrong
 I


think
 I'm
 wrong
 at
 least
 40%
 of
 the
 time


which
 would
 make
 me
 in
 baseball
 terms


the
 the
 the
 most
 productive
 player


ever
 well
 let's
 let's
 create
 an


organizational
 culture
 that
 accepts
 that


you
 can


fail
 and
 fix
 your
 mistakes


quickly
 let's
 not
 get
 let's
 not
 fire


people
 for
 making
 bad
 decisions
 let's


fire
 them
 for
 making
 no


decision
 and
 that's
 I
 think
 what
 we've


done
 so
 I
 sit
 out
 and
 I
 I
 think
 about
 uh


what
 the
 team
 said
 this
 morning
 what
 you


heard
 from
 uh
 Wellington
 what
 you
 heard


from
 Helman
 and
 Freeman
 what
 you
 heard


from
 Oak
 Tre
 and
 I
 think
 all
 of
 it
 is


true
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 add
 my
 gloss
 on


top
 of
 it
 I
 think
 we
 as


investors
 are
 not
 mindful
 enough
 of
 the


massive
 change
 taking
 place
 and
 I
 think


some
 of
 the
 change
 is
 predictable
 so


I'll
 give
 you
 how
 we
 are
 building
 our


business
 based
 on
 change
 on
 things
 that


we


observe
 2008
 we
 nearly
 destroyed
 the


worldwide
 finan
 ccial
 system
 we


implemented
 massive
 amounts
 of
 change


none
 of
 us
 me
 included
 have
 yet
 to


experience
 any
 of
 that
 change
 because


right
 after
 we
 changed
 the
 rules
 we


printed
 $8
 trillion
 and
 everything
 went


up
 and
 to
 the
 right
 we've
 now
 had
 about


18
 months
 of
 living
 with


change
 so
 what
 could
 we


observe
 easy
 one
 are
 public
 markets


liquid
 I
 don't
 think
 so
 maybe
 on
 the


equity
 side
 that's
 true
 on
 the
 fixed


income
 side
 no
 2008
 put
 an
 extreme


penalty
 on
 Market
 making
 capital
 in


fixed
 income
 in
 particular
 Market
 making


capital
 is
 10%
 of
 what
 it
 was
 today
 of


what
 it
 was
 in
 2008
 markets
 are
 three


times
 their
 size
 yes
 we
 are
 living
 with


a
 30th
 of
 the
 liquidity
 it
 now
 takes
 5


days
 to
 sell
 an
 investment
 grade


corporate
 bond
 outside
 the
 top


20
 we've
 actually
 witnessed
 wholesale


Market
 failure
 this
 cute
 little
 thing


called
 ldi
 in
 the
 UK
 this
 was
 not
 some


crazy
 thing
 UK
 institutions
 were
 doing


this
 was
 a
 mistaken
 belief
 that
 they


could
 sell
 AAA
 and
 doublea
 obligations


at
 or
 near
 the
 market
 price
 they
 were


wrong
 they
 started
 selling
 the
 price


collapsed
 Bank
 of
 England
 ultimately
 had


to
 step
 in
 should
 we
 actually
 think
 on
 a


go
 forward
 basis
 that
 this
 is
 the
 norm


that
 liquidity
 only
 exists
 on
 the
 way
 up


it
 does
 not
 exist
 on
 the
 way


down
 why
 do
 we
 want
 to
 be


public
 why
 do
 we
 actually
 distinguish


between
 public
 and


private
 what
 is
 actually
 the
 difference


between
 public
 and
 private
 it's
 not


clear
 to
 me
 that
 there's
 any
 liquidity


difference
 equities


aside
 second
 big
 fundamental
 change
 2008


most
 of
 the
 regulation
 around
 the
 world


not
 just
 then
 But
 continuing
 to
 today


has
 to
 reduce
 the
 role
 of
 banks
 in
 the


economy
 everywhere
 in
 the
 world
 is
 going


through
 de
 banking
 at
 different
 rates
 in


the
 US
 Banks
 today
 are
 less
 than
 30%
 of


debt


Capital
 investors
 are
 the
 other


percentage
 every
 regulator
 every


government
 everywhere
 in
 the
 world
 has


two
 choices
 Capital
 can
 come
 from
 Banks


or
 Capital
 can
 come
 from
 investors


there's
 no
 third
 choice
 once
 you
 choose


investors
 you
 have
 two
 more
 choices
 they


can
 come
 from
 the
 daily
 liquid
 public


markets
 or
 they
 can
 come
 from


institutional
 private
 markets
 think


about
 the
 priorities
 particularly
 in


Europe
 energy
 transition
 climate
 change


infrastructure
 everything
 I
 just


mentioned
 is


longterm
 why
 would
 we
 want
 that
 funded


on
 a
 daily
 liquid
 basis
 wouldn't
 we
 want


that
 funded
 in
 institutional
 markets
 to


match


liquidity
 where
 is
 systemic
 risk
 think


about
 why
 banking
 is
 being
 disfavored


banking
 is
 being
 disfavored
 in
 part


because
 Banks
 borrow
 short
 and
 lend


long
 do
 we
 really
 want
 more
 borrow
 short


lend
 long
 by
 using
 more
 public
 markets


or
 do
 we
 want
 private
 markets


this
 whole


rethink
 of
 the
 role
 of
 a
 bank
 the
 role


of
 an
 investor
 is
 a
 massive
 change
 we
 as


investors
 are
 going
 to
 experience


products
 in
 the
 financial
 uh
 excuse
 me


in
 the
 fixed
 income
 space
 that
 we've


never
 seen
 before
 risk
 rewards


products
 returns
 that
 have
 been
 locked


on
 the
 balance
 sheets
 of
 financial


institutions
 for
 the
 last
 40
 years
 are


on
 their
 way
 to
 you
 as
 investment


products
 we're
 all
 going
 to
 have
 to
 come


overcome
 biases
 that
 we
 have
 about


public
 and
 private
 other
 big
 change


indexation
 and


correlation
 do
 we
 have
 price
 Discovery


in
 US


markets
 I
 don't


know
 35%
 of
 83%
 of
 the
 US
 market
 is
 S&P


500
 10
 stocks
 are
 35%
 of
 the
 S&P
 those


10
 stocks
 trade
 at
 a
 45
 PE
 today
 how


many
 of
 us
 come
 in
 every
 day
 trying
 to


buy
 45
 PE
 stocks


probably
 none
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 think
 of


the
 largest
 pool
 of
 capital
 in
 the
 world


today12
 trillion
 do
 sitting
 in


401K
 for
 us
 mid-market
 investors
 people


who
 really
 need
 Returns
 what
 are
 these


people
 invested
 in
 Daily
 liquid
 index


funds
 for
 50
 years
 why
 why
 do
 we
 have


people
 invested
 in
 Daily
 liquid
 index


funds
 for
 50


years
 and
 it'll
 go
 to
 where
 I
 think


change
 is
 really


coming
 we
 we
 are
 going
 through
 an
 entire


evaluation
 of
 public
 versus


private
 in
 my
 40
 years
 I
 certainly
 grew


up
 thinking
 public
 is
 safe
 private
 is


risky
 and
 for
 most
 of
 my
 career
 that's


been
 true
 private
 was
 three
 products


Venture
 Capital
 hedge
 funds
 and
 private


Equity
 all
 three
 are
 risky
 public
 was


safe
 in
 the
 US
 at
 least
 8,000
 public


companies
 Diversified
 portfolios
 of


stocks
 and


bonds
 why
 what
 if
 that's
 not
 the
 case


anymore
 what
 if
 private
 is
 both
 safe
 and


risky
 and
 public
 is
 safe
 and


risky
 how
 should
 we
 think
 about


investing
 how
 should
 we
 think
 about


portfolios
 most
 of
 us
 most
 institutions


operate
 with
 a
 private
 bucket
 or
 an


Alternatives
 bucket
 why
 don't
 you
 have
 a


public
 bucket
 rather
 than
 a
 private


bucket
 we
 went
 from
 8,000
 public


companies
 in
 the
 US
 to
 4,000
 public


companies
 and
 I
 would
 bet
 that's
 going


to
 go
 down
 not


up
 shouldn't
 we
 have
 half
 our
 money
 in


private
 I
 think
 we've
 looked
 to
 private


markets
 for
 rate
 of
 return
 because
 we've


always
 perceived
 it
 as
 as
 more
 risky


therefore
 more
 return
 is
 desired
 I
 think


we're
 going
 to
 look
 to
 private
 markets


for


diversification
 I
 think
 to
 escape


indexation
 and


concentration
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to


look
 to
 private
 Market
 Market
 I
 think


we're
 going
 to
 think
 the
 whole
 no


rethink
 a
 whole
 notion
 of
 risk
 and


reward
 the
 things
 that
 we've
 taken
 for


granted
 that
 public
 is
 safe
 and
 that


private
 is
 risky
 that
 banks
 are
 a
 sort


of
 Deb
 financing
 that
 daily
 liquid
 by


the
 way
 why
 do
 we
 have
 daily
 liquid


funds
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 does
 an


institution
 with
 a
 20
 or
 40-year
 time


Horizon
 concern
 itself
 with


liquidity
 I
 don't
 know


these
 are
 we
 are
 breaking
 taboo


investors
 right
 now
 are
 confused
 and


they're
 confused
 because
 they're
 looking


back
 at


history
 and
 they're
 saying
 this
 worked


but
 what
 they're
 not
 yet
 willing
 to
 do


is
 to
 question
 the


fundamentals
 is
 the
 system
 totally


different
 have
 things
 changed
 are
 we
 in


the
 absence
 of


Tailwinds
 am
 I
 willing
 to
 revisit


underlying


assumptions
 think
 about
 the
 following


like
 coming
 back
 to
 the
 notion
 of
 price


Discovery
 active
 management
 of
 equity
 is


a
 really
 difficult
 business
 very
 few


people
 do
 it
 really
 well
 have
 the


discipline
 have
 60
 teams
 if
 I
 told
 you


there
 was
 a
 market
 where
 for
 20
 years


93%
 of
 the
 participants
 fail
 to
 beat
 the


index
 you
 would
 be
 concerned
 did
 these


people
 get


stupider
 I
 don't
 think
 so
 well
 has
 the


structure
 of
 the
 market
 changed


I
 think
 the
 structure
 of
 the
 market
 has


changed
 I
 think
 the
 whole
 notion
 of


daily
 liquidity
 is
 going
 to


change
 we
 are
 betting
 it
 on
 that
 we've


built
 a
 business
 that
 is
 650
 billion


today
 which
 will
 be
 twice
 its
 size
 in
 5


years
 based
 on
 a


bet
 that
 investors
 are
 going
 to
 revisit


how
 they
 think
 it
 is
 already
 happening


so
 if
 you
 take
 the
 typical
 investor
 and


I'll
 I'll
 take
 your
 portfolio
 but
 then


I'll
 I'll
 simplify
 it


um
 typical
 Institutional
 Investor
 that


invests
 with
 us
 is
 50
 is%
 invested
 in


public
 Equity
 daily
 liquid
 30%
 invested


in
 fixed
 income
 daily
 liquid
 and
 20%
 in


everything


else


why
 no
 one
 knows
 that's
 what
 we've
 done


that's
 what's
 worked
 historically
 and


we're
 actually
 watching
 this
 change
 in


real
 time
 and
 the
 place
 it's
 changing


first
 is
 in
 fixed
 income
 a
 sing
 a
 rated


private


security
 is
 that
 an
 alternative
 or
 is


that
 fixed
 income
 I
 ask
 cios
 this


question
 all
 the
 time
 it
 can
 stump
 them


for
 an
 hour
 because
 we've
 all
 grown
 up


thinking
 this
 thing
 doesn't
 exist
 we
 are


watching
 institutional
 investors
 look
 at


their
 fixed
 income
 portfolio
 and
 they


are
 moving
 their
 fixed
 income


portfolio
 not
 into
 public
 and
 private


but
 into
 Alpha
 and


beta
 we
 are
 going
 to
 watch
 a
 turnover
 of


the
 the
 fixed
 income
 portfolio
 of


institutional
 investors
 move
 into


private
 markets
 and
 the
 reason
 that's


happening
 is
 there's
 an
 Arbiter
 there's


a
 rating
 agency
 someone
 can
 say
 this
 was


a-rated
 this
 was
 a-rated
 you
 can
 pick
 up


200
 basis
 points
 of
 yield
 for
 moving


therefore
 we
 should
 move
 since
 we
 don't


need
 the


liquidity
 what
 about
 if
 the
 same
 were


true
 in


equity
 what
 if
 people
 took
 their
 50%


Equity


bucket
 and
 they
 actually
 thought
 about


diversification
 they
 thought
 about
 the


number
 of
 public
 companies
 and
 rather


than
 think
 about
 private
 Equity
 because


private
 equity
 and
 I
 know
 the
 debate
 is


taking
 place
 in
 this
 country
 in
 real


time
 private
 Equity
 is
 lever
 Equity
 it's


in
 a
 fund
 structure
 it
 produces
 some


binary


outcomes
 what
 if
 we
 talked
 about
 Equity


that's
 private
 rather
 than
 private


Equity
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 harder
 move


for
 people
 because
 there's
 no
 rating


agency
 yet
 that
 is
 willing
 to
 allow


people
 to
 talk
 across
 the
 spectrum
 of


public
 and
 private
 and
 equal
 risk
 but


that's
 the
 world
 we
 live
 in
 today
 more


companies
 are
 going
 to
 be
 private
 people


who
 are
 not
 invested
 in
 in
 equity
 that


is
 private
 are
 missing
 out
 on
 half
 of


the
 marketplace
 they
 are
 concentrating


their
 portfolios
 the
 notion
 that
 their


public
 portfolios
 have
 performed
 well
 in


the


past
 does
 not
 surprise
 me
 we
 are
 indexed


and
 correlated
 we
 have
 been
 driven
 by


money
 flows
 we've
 printed
 $8
 trillion


dollar
 in
 the
 US


100%
 of
 last
 year's
 return
 was


essentially
 10


stocks
 everyone
 has
 woken
 up
 and


discovered
 that
 they
 own
 Nvidia
 apple


and
 Amazon
 and
 Microsoft
 and
 is
 levered


the
 same
 way
 it's
 not
 clear
 to
 me
 that


that's


sustainable
 and
 for
 me
 as
 a
 leader
 of
 a


business
 I
 think
 Adam's
 notion
 of
 humble


confidence
 uh
 is
 is
 actually
 a
 really


good
 one
 we
 all
 are
 confronted
 with


change
 we're
 all
 confronted
 with
 un
 un


certainty
 but
 while
 we
 do
 the
 little


things
 to
 deal
 with
 change
 and


uncertainty
 and
 we
 we
 reflect
 contrary


opinion
 and
 we
 allow
 for
 intellectual


insubordination
 how
 many
 of
 us
 actually


Force
 the
 organization
 to
 fundamentally


rethink
 whether
 the
 things
 we
 think
 are


true
 are


true
 I
 want
 to
 challenge
 that
 I
 want
 all


of
 you
 to
 think
 about
 that
 I
 don't
 think


what
 we've
 grown
 up
 in
 exists
 anymore
 I


don't
 think
 the
 financial
 system
 works


the
 way
 we
 think
 it
 does
 I
 think


liquidity
 is
 different
 the
 sources
 of


debt
 are
 different
 indexation
 and


correlation
 are
 different
 the
 whole


notion
 of
 public
 and
 private
 are


different
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 the


strategies
 that
 we've
 employed
 over
 the


past
 40
 years
 are
 going
 to
 work
 going


forward
 that's
 a
 really
 uncomfortable


thing
 for
 us
 to
 deal
 with
 because
 we're


all
 used
 to
 doing
 due
 diligence
 and


looking
 at
 track
 record
 looking
 at


historical


correlations
 it's
 not
 clear
 to
 me
 that


that
 is
 any
 value
 thank
 you
 this

[Music]


today
 hello
 greetings
 from
 Philadelphia


and
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 having
 me
 uh


it's
 my
 honor
 to
 follow
 Mark
 and
 to
 um


say
 that
 you
 know
 in
 uh
 a
 climate
 of


uncertainty
 and
 change
 um
 but
 also
 I


would
 say
 you
 know
 historically
 across


time
 that
 there
 has
 been
 a
 quality
 of


the
 highest
 Achievers
 in
 every
 domain
 at


least
 every
 domain
 that
 I
 have
 studied


and
 that
 includes
 leadership
 um
 so
 I'd


like
 to
 present
 to
 you
 today
 what
 I
 have


discovered
 about
 what
 grit
 is
 why
 it's


special
 and
 what
 this
 means
 especially


in
 the
 leadership
 context
 um
 I
 want
 to


say
 on
 a
 personal
 note
 that
 I
 grew
 up


with
 a
 father
 who
 only
 talked
 about


being
 a
 world
 class
 achiever
 literally


that's
 all
 we
 talked
 about
 at
 breakfast


at
 dinner
 on
 the
 weekends
 summer


vacations
 um
 and
 my
 dad
 talked
 a
 lot
 um


implicitly
 about
 how
 the
 highest


Achievers
 were
 naturally
 talented
 they


were
 smarter
 than
 everyone
 they
 were


more
 gifted
 and
 what
 I
 grew
 up
 to
 learn


as
 a
 psychologist
 is
 that
 Talent
 innate


Talent
 especially
 had
 has
 nothing
 to
 do


with
 grit
 let
 me
 show
 you
 four
 questions


from
 the
 grit
 scale
 to
 give
 you
 a
 sense


of
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about
 um
 here's
 an


item
 that
 indexes
 your
 perseverance
 for


long-term
 goals
 ask
 yourself
 whether
 if


I
 talk
 to
 your
 closest
 colleagues


whether
 they
 would
 rush
 to
 tell
 me
 that


you
 are
 an
 especially
 hard
 worker
 um


would
 they
 tell
 me
 that
 you
 uh
 finish


whatever
 you
 begin
 um
 this
 item
 by
 the


way
 um
 also
 an
 index
 of
 your
 person


perseverance
 for
 longterm
 goals
 is
 the


single
 most
 predictive
 item
 on
 the
 grit


scale
 so
 this
 is
 probably
 what
 you
 think


of
 when
 you
 think
 of
 grit
 someone
 who's


really
 a
 hard
 worker
 also
 uh
 you
 know


resilient
 in
 the
 face
 of
 setbacks
 they


finish
 things
 when
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 people


quit
 and
 I
 would
 tell
 you
 that
 that
 is


half
 right
 because
 that
 is
 half
 of
 grit


uh
 but
 grit
 is
 also
 passion
 for


long-term
 goals
 and
 let
 me
 show
 you
 two


items
 from
 the
 GR
 scale
 that
 index
 your


passion
 for
 long-term
 goals
 and
 before


you
 read
 them
 I
 need
 to
 warn
 you
 that


they're
 reverse
 scor
 meaning
 that
 if
 you


read
 them
 you
 say
 wow
 that's
 just
 like


me
 that's
 how
 everyone
 would
 describe
 me


then
 actually
 you
 get
 a
 lower
 passion


score
 and
 a
 lower
 overall
 grit
 score
 for


example
 I
 have
 difficulty
 maintaining
 my


focus
 on
 projects
 that
 take
 more
 than
 a


few
 months
 to
 complete
 or
 I
 often
 say
 a


goal
 but
 later
 choose
 to
 pursue
 a


different
 one
 uh
 given
 that
 I'm


following
 Mark
 and
 his
 comments
 I
 do


want
 to
 say
 importantly
 that
 when
 I


study
 grit
 this
 combination
 of


perseverance
 and
 passion
 for
 long-term


goals
 I
 want
 to
 say
 on
 the
 passion


element
 that
 in
 the
 context
 of


uncertainty
 and
 change
 now
 more
 than


ever
 what
 I
 what
 I
 mean
 about
 passion


for
 long-term
 goals
 is
 a
 kind
 of


steadfast
 and
 even
 stubborn
 dedication


to
 some
 top
 level
 goals
 some
 it's


usually
 very
 abstract
 it
 can
 even
 be
 um


so
 abstract
 as
 to
 not
 be
 easily


understandable
 by
 other
 people
 um
 but


you
 want
 extreme
 agility
 and
 flexibility


on
 how
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 there
 um
 and


I
 think
 that
 reconciles
 in
 some
 ways
 the


current
 environment
 of
 of
 uncertainty


and
 change
 with
 this
 um
 Timeless


character
 strength
 of
 grit
 now
 I
 said


that
 in
 my
 research
 that
 I
 found
 grit


and
 talent
 to
 be
 not
 at
 all
 related
 and


that's
 exactly
 true
 in
 my
 research
 and


in
 research
 from
 around
 the
 world
 when


you
 measure
 IQ
 or
 other
 kinds
 of
 natural


ability
 uh
 you
 find
 that
 IQ
 is
 great
 it


predicts
 achievement
 but
 it's
 not


correlated
 with
 grit
 which
 I
 think
 is
 at


least
 as
 essential
 and
 I
 want
 to
 um


share
 with
 you
 one
 personal
 um


relationship
 that
 I
 have
 with
 a
 paragon


of
 grit
 because
 I
 think
 he
 illustrates


um
 how
 talent
 and
 grit
 are
 different
 and


how
 grit
 in
 some
 ways
 unleashes
 uh
 the


the
 talent
 that
 uh
 people
 have
 in
 order


for
 them
 to
 accomplish
 great
 things
 um


meet
 Toby
 Cosgrove
 Toby
 Cosgrove
 grew
 up


he
 was
 a
 a
 very
 mediocre
 student
 uh


turns
 out
 he
 had
 dyslexia
 a
 reading


disability
 but
 um
 in
 those
 days
 they


didn't
 have
 a
 word
 for
 it
 they
 just


thought
 he
 was
 slow
 um
 but
 he
 wanted
 to


be
 um
 a
 doctor
 and
 he
 eventually
 um
 got


into
 medical
 school
 and
 he
 eventually


graduated
 from
 medical
 school
 when
 it


was
 time
 for
 him
 to
 choose
 his
 specialty


um
 he
 wanted
 the
 hardest
 one
 so
 he
 he


chose
 heart
 surgery
 and
 and
 it
 was
 the


most
 competitive
 and
 everyone
 told
 him


he
 couldn't
 do
 it
 um
 but
 Toby
 did
 it


anyway
 um
 he
 was
 told
 while
 he
 was
 a


resident
 in
 uh
 heart
 surgery
 cardiac


surgery
 that
 he
 was
 the
 least
 talented


individual
 there
 was
 um
 and
 uh
 he
 didn't


disagree
 with
 that
 um
 but
 he
 believed


that
 he
 could
 learn
 from
 his
 failures


failure
 is
 a
 great
 teacher
 he
 said
 um


and
 Toby
 went
 on
 to
 work
 and
 work
 and


work
 at
 refining
 the
 craft
 of
 cardiac


surgery
 um
 he
 said
 he
 was
 on
 a
 constant


quest
 to
 find
 ways
 uh
 to
 do
 things


better
 and
 I
 want
 to
 share
 one
 um
 very


specific
 story
 from
 you
 know
 Toby's


early
 years
 as
 a
 cardiac
 surgeon
 um
 he


realized
 that
 there
 were
 other
 surgeons


in
 the
 world
 who
 were
 far
 better
 than
 he


was
 so
 he
 would
 uh
 go
 to
 see
 them
 he


would
 get
 on
 a
 plane
 like
 Mark
 did
 and


he
 would
 travel
 and
 he
 would
 stand
 in


the
 operating
 theater
 not
 operating


himself
 of
 course
 and
 he
 would
 take


notes
 and
 he
 would
 watch
 like
 a
 hawk
 and


these
 these
 Discovery
 trips
 um
 as
 he


sometimes
 called
 them
 he
 would
 come
 back


and
 then
 he
 would
 have
 a
 goal
 he
 would


have
 a
 picture
 in
 his
 head
 of
 something


he
 could
 do
 better
 than
 that
 he
 would


try
 to
 do
 as
 as
 best
 he
 could
 and
 then


to
 refine
 and
 refine
 and
 refine
 and
 to


improve
 and
 I
 want
 to
 share
 with
 you
 how


this
 links
 up
 to
 um
 what
 is
 sometimes


called
 the
 10,000
 hour
 rule
 10,000
 hours


of
 practice
 now
 it's
 a
 dark
 Auditorium


and
 I'm
 in
 Philadelphia
 I'm
 not
 with
 you


but
 I'd
 like
 you
 to
 raise
 your
 hand
 if


you've
 ever
 heard
 this
 expression
 10,000


hours
 of
 practice
 10,000
 hours
 you
 know


makes
 you
 great
 at
 what
 you
 do
 well
 um


uh
 I
 know
 it's
 not
 the
 same
 country
 but


I
 do
 want
 to
 say
 that
 in
 Sweden
 there


was
 born
 a
 scientist
 named
 Andre
 Ericson


and
 um
 he
 was
 the
 scientist
 whose


research
 became
 popularized
 as
 the


10,000
 hour
 rule
 now
 Anders
 was
 a
 dear


friend
 of
 mine
 he
 passed
 away
 several


years
 ago
 um
 but
 he
 spent
 his
 entire


life
 as
 a
 cognitive
 scientist
 trying
 to


understand
 the
 learning
 curve
 of


worldclass
 experts
 so
 Grand
 chess


Masters
 Olympic
 gold
 medalist
 athletes


prima
 ballerinas
 worldclass


mathematicians
 etc
 etc
 and
 that


expression
 that
 you've
 heard
 of
 10,000


hours
 of
 practice
 comes
 from
 a
 single


study
 just
 one
 of
 his
 studies
 that


showed
 that
 at
 a
 German
 Music
 Academy


the
 very
 best
 musicians
 those
 who
 would


go
 on
 to
 recording
 contracts
 and
 um


achieve
 worldclass
 prominence
 um
 they


had
 on
 average
 about
 10,000
 hours
 of
 a


certain
 kind
 of
 practice
 the
 next
 group


had
 less
 of
 it
 maybe
 7,500
 hours
 and
 the


worst
 group
 who
 were
 still
 pretty
 great


because
 this
 was
 a
 selective
 German


Music
 Academy
 they
 had
 maybe
 5,000
 now


that
 became
 popularized
 as
 a
 kind
 of
 um


heris
 a
 rule
 that
 the
 quantity
 of


practice
 makes
 you
 great
 but
 I
 want
 to


show
 you
 a
 different
 learning
 curve
 that


Anders
 also
 discovered
 and
 this
 graph


essentially
 summarizes
 his
 lifetime
 of


insight
 into
 how
 to
 become
 world
 class


at
 what
 you
 do
 you
 can
 put
 in
 10,000


hours
 or
 20,000
 or
 even
 40,000
 hours
 of


a
 different
 kind
 of
 practice
 a
 less


effective
 kind
 of
 practice
 and
 actually


stop
 improving
 unlike
 world-class


experts
 I
 call
 this
 the
 plateau
 of


Arrested
 Development
 and
 I
 think
 it


makes
 the
 point
 that
 it's
 not
 just


quantity
 of
 practice
 that
 makes
 you


world
 class
 it's
 the
 quality
 of
 the


practice
 you're
 doing
 now
 I
 want
 to


unpack
 that
 for
 you
 very
 specifically


because
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lesson
 in
 that


for
 every
 leader
 for
 every
 investor
 and


indeed
 every
 performer
 who
 wants
 to
 get


somewhat
 better
 every
 day
 at
 what


they're
 doing
 before
 I
 unpack
 that
 I


want
 to
 show
 you
 another
 learning
 curve


um
 I
 have
 two
 daughters
 and
 I
 raise
 them


to
 believe
 that
 life
 is
 a
 multiple


choice
 question
 you
 have
 a
 choice
 of


improving
 every
 single
 day
 at
 what
 you


do
 that's
 the
 path
 to
 becoming
 a


world-class
 expert
 there
 is
 plateauing


at
 some
 level
 of
 mediocre
 performance


you
 know
 you
 get
 better
 in
 your
 first


year
 you
 get
 a
 little
 better
 in
 your


second
 year
 but
 maybe
 in
 your
 fourth
 or


fifth
 year
 you're
 just
 on
 autopilot


that's
 probably
 most
 people
 and
 then


there's
 a
 third
 choice
 for
 you
 in
 life


and
 that
 is
 to
 drop
 out
 of
 what
 you're


doing
 now
 especially
 given
 Mark's


comments
 and
 my
 own
 um
 personal
 history


and
 what
 I've
 learned
 as
 a
 scientist
 I


want
 to
 emphasize
 to
 you
 today
 that


dropping
 out
 is
 sometimes
 exactly
 the


thing
 to
 do
 especially
 when
 there's
 some


low-level
 goal
 some
 tactic
 some


quarterly
 objective
 that's
 just
 not


working
 out
 or
 when
 the
 opportunity
 cost


exceeds
 what
 you're
 doing
 right
 now


those
 are
 excellent
 reasons
 to
 drop
 out


I
 played
 piano
 when
 I
 was
 a
 little
 girl


and
 I'm
 so
 glad
 I
 quit
 because
 I
 wasn't


very
 good
 at
 it
 and
 I
 didn't
 love
 it
 and


I
 was
 able
 to
 take
 my
 time
 and
 devote
 it


to
 something
 else
 but
 what
 you
 find


about
 every
 world-class
 investor
 and


every
 worldclass
 leader
 is
 that
 they


eventually
 find
 something
 that
 they
 love


enough
 to
 keep
 with
 it
 to
 stay
 improving


and
 improving
 to
 have
 passion
 for
 that


long-term
 top
 level
 goal
 that
 keeps
 them


motivated
 now
 here
 is
 what
 Andre
 Ericson


discovered
 about
 high
 quality
 practice


it
 has
 three
 specific
 elements
 and


they're
 quite
 easy
 to
 understand
 but


maybe
 not
 easy
 to
 do
 in
 combination
 the


first
 element
 is
 that
 you
 must
 decide
 on


a
 very
 specific
 narrow
 aspect
 of
 your


overall
 performance
 and
 you
 drill
 that


in
 particular
 so
 uh
 if
 you
 if
 you
 ask
 an


Olympic
 Athlete
 you
 know
 like
 you
 know
 a


skier
 you
 know
 like
 what
 are
 you
 doing


they're
 not
 going
 to
 say
 I'm
 skiing


better
 they're
 going
 to
 give
 you
 a
 very


technical
 answer
 that
 you
 probably
 only


understand
 if
 you
 were
 also
 a


world-class
 skier
 now
 they
 uh
 they
 do


this
 usually
 with
 a
 coach
 helping
 them


but
 when
 they
 practice
 they
 usually


practice
 alone
 so
 Andre's
 discovered


toward
 the
 end
 of
 his
 career
 that
 almost


everyone
 needs
 a
 mentor
 to
 show
 them
 and


to
 help
 them
 identify
 what
 to
 do
 next


but
 when
 they
 do
 the
 work
 it
 is
 almost


always
 uh
 alone
 uh
 so
 they
 can


concentrate
 completely
 and
 and
 really


pay
 attention
 to
 what
 they're
 doing
 so


the
 second
 element
 is
 practicing
 with


complete
 Focus
 the
 opposite
 of


multitasking
 if
 you
 will
 and
 the
 third


element
 is
 the
 hardest
 motivationally


psychologic
 Ally
 I
 would
 say
 which
 is


that
 you
 have
 to
 get
 feedback
 on
 what


you're
 doing
 feedback
 on
 that


performance
 and
 then
 to
 repeat
 the
 cycle


again
 and
 I
 say
 it's
 the
 most
 difficult


motivationally
 because
 if
 you
 tell
 me


one
 thing
 that
 I
 could
 have
 done
 better


for
 you
 today
 in
 my
 15
 minutes
 with
 you


I
 will
 immediately
 be
 defensive
 I
 don't


want
 to
 hear
 you
 criticize
 what
 I
 just


did
 but
 if
 I
 ignore
 your
 feedback
 then
 I


will
 never
 get
 better
 as
 a
 speaker
 and


so
 this
 feedback
 is
 the
 essential


element
 closing
 the
 feedback
 uh
 closing


the
 learning
 Loop
 but
 also
 it's


something
 that
 is
 the
 enemy
 of


ego
 now
 if
 you
 are
 somebody
 like
 Toby


cosgro
 if
 you
 do
 this
 kind
 of
 deliberate


Practice
 Day
 in
 day
 out
 to
 become
 a


better
 cardiac
 surgeon
 you
 have
 a
 top


level
 goal
 let
 me
 show
 you
 what
 a


hierarchy
 of
 goals
 looks
 like
 uh
 for


somebody
 like
 like
 Toby
 Cosgrove
 all


human
 beings
 have
 goals
 but
 what
 makes


gritty
 people
 special
 is
 that
 there
 is
 a


top
 level
 goal
 for
 which
 they
 have
 so


much
 passion
 and
 perseverance
 that
 they


don't
 give
 up
 for
 Toby
 that
 was
 to


improve
 the
 patients
 lives
 that
 he
 was


working
 with
 both
 the
 quality
 and
 the


length
 of
 their
 life
 and
 to
 achieve
 that


goal
 he
 had
 mid-level
 goals
 you
 know


prevent
 cardiac
 conditions
 the
 treat
 the


conditions
 coordinate
 care
 and
 then


there
 were
 these
 low-level
 tactical


goals
 that
 uh
 he
 should
 be
 more
 flexible


and
 agile
 with
 but
 he
 should
 be
 very


stubborn
 about
 the
 top
 level
 goal
 now
 I


want
 to
 say
 what
 happened
 to
 Toby
 so
 he


became
 uh
 arguably
 the
 best
 heart


surgeon
 in
 the
 world
 he
 invented
 many


procedures
 um
 that
 are
 still
 in
 use


today
 um
 and
 then
 he
 became
 a
 leader
 uh


he
 became
 a
 real
 leader
 and
 he
 um
 uh


became
 the
 CEO
 of
 the
 Cleveland
 clinic


now
 the
 Cleveland
 Clinic
 is
 um
 uh
 one
 of


the
 world's
 most
 um
 renowned
 medical


facilities
 and
 suddenly
 to
 had
 to


understand
 how
 to
 lead
 with
 grit
 not


just
 how
 to
 be
 a
 performer
 with
 grit
 but


a
 leader
 with
 grit
 and
 I
 want
 to
 end


with
 this
 Insight
 I
 believe
 that
 what
 a


gritty
 organization
 is
 a
 gritty
 company


for
 example
 is
 uh
 in
 a
 way
 it's
 a


macrocosm
 of
 what
 a
 gritty
 individual
 is


so
 there
 is
 still
 a
 top
 level
 goal
 there


is
 a
 goal
 hierarchy
 with
 mid-level
 goals


and
 low-level
 goals
 I
 believe
 that
 the


top
 level
 goal
 in
 this
 case
 when
 Toby


took
 over
 the
 Cleveland
 Clinic
 he
 made


the
 top
 level
 goal
 put
 Patients
 First


just
 those
 three
 words
 everybody
 walked


around
 with
 buttons
 that
 said
 put


Patients
 First
 when
 I
 talked
 to
 the
 uh


secretaries
 and
 the
 custodians
 anybody


at
 the
 Cleveland
 Clinic
 I
 said
 what's


this
 place
 all
 about
 they
 said
 put


Patients
 First
 every
 single
 one
 of
 them


told
 me
 that
 now
 they
 all
 had
 different


jobs
 right
 they
 all
 had
 different


functions
 there
 was
 a
 hierarchy
 but


there
 was
 this


steadfast


stubborn
 dedication
 to
 a
 top
 level
 goal


and
 I
 want
 to
 say
 in
 conclusion
 that
 if


you
 believe
 that
 Talent
 is
 not
 enough
 if


you
 believe
 that
 it's
 not
 enough
 to
 be


lucky
 if
 you
 believe
 that
 in
 addition


you
 need
 to
 have
 passion
 and


perseverance
 at
 the
 individual
 level
 as


a
 performer
 you
 must
 also
 believe
 that


you
 need
 that
 at
 the
 organizational


level
 and
 that
 to
 me
 is
 the
 essence
 of


leadership
 with
 Grit


um
 in
 the
 words
 of
 the
 Great
 American


writer
 Ralph
 Waldo
 Emerson
 any


institution
 is
 the
 lengthen
 shadow
 of


its
 leader
 when
 I
 find
 gritty
 leaders
 I


find
 gritty
 organizations
 when
 I
 find


gritty
 organizations
 I
 find
 gritty


leaders
 there
 is
 a
 top
 level
 goal
 that


motivates
 both
 and
 in
 on
 a
 personal
 note


I
 will
 say
 the
 reason
 I
 am
 so
 delighted


to
 be
 with
 you
 um
 is
 that
 I
 think


Nikolai
 is
 uh
 truly
 a
 great
 leader
 uh
 he


leads
 with
 grit
 and
 integrity
 and
 has


been
 an
 example
 for
 me
 uh
 for
 many
 years


so
 in
 friendship
 and
 in
 uh
 admiration
 I


say
 thank


you
 thanks
 to
 Angela
 for
 sharing
 her


views
 who
 I'm
 sure
 is
 continuing
 to


watch
 us
 life
 it
 is
 now
 time
 for
 break


we
 all
 resume
 at
 15:40
 for
 our
 last


session
 on
 behavorial
 aspects
 of


excellent


[Music]


investors
 now
 we've
 heard
 a
 lot
 about


what
 makes
 a
 great


investor
 a
 great
 investor
 is
 someone
 who


knows
 a
 company
 in
 depth
 some
 people
 go


all
 the
 way
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 learning


what
 the
 company
 is
 all
 about
 we
 sent


one
 of
 our
 employees
 in
 the
 real
 world


to
 check
 out
 some
 of
 the
 companies
 we


own
 let
 us
 see
 how
 that


went
 hi
 everybody
 live
 from
 McDonald's


today
 really
 good
 best
 fries
 now
 in
 the


fund
 we
 own
 shares
 the
 equivalent
 to
 400


million
 Big
 Macs
 now
 when
 you
 see
 me


with
 a
 football
 you're
 probably
 going
 to


mistake
 me
 for
 H
 on
 and
 we
 are
 nearly


from
 the
 same
 place
 in
 Norway
 but
 not


not
 quite
 just
 uh
 put
 on
 my
 really


really
 good
 uh
 sliders
 today
 with
 my


very
 typical
 Norwegian
 socks
 going
 into


some
 proper
 deep
 learning
 here
 we
 are


folding
 Pizza


books
 that
 only
 took
 me
 5
 minutes
 in
 the


podcast
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 spend
 a
 lot


of
 time
 on
 the
 secret
 source
 and
 you


know
 what
 in
 this
 case
 here
 it


is
 re
 perhaps
 a
 little
 a
 bit
 a
 little


bit
 too
 much
 tomato


sauce
 love
 it
 I
 think
 we
 put
 on
 a
 bit


[Music]


more
 I
 guess
 Nikolai
 should
 have


listened
 to
 our
 next
 speaker
 a
 little


bit
 more
 when
 it
 came
 to
 quitting
 on


that
 tomato
 sauce
 because
 our
 next


speaker
 is
 a
 master
 of
 knowing
 when
 to


quit
 Annie
 Duke
 is
 a
 worldclass
 poker


player
 but
 she's
 also
 the
 author
 of
 the


bestselling
 book
 quit
 she's
 here
 with
 us


today
 joining
 us
 online
 welcome
 to
 Annie


[Applause]


[Music]


[Applause]


[Music]


hi
 everyone
 I'm
 so
 happy
 to
 be
 here


virtually
 uh
 I'm
 going
 to
 talk
 to
 you


today
 about
 quitting
 and
 particularly


how
 do
 we
 improve
 our
 exit
 decisions
 and


why
 do
 we
 really
 want
 to
 do
 that
 so
 the


problem
 that
 we
 have
 as
 decision
 makers


is
 that
 uncertainty
 makes
 it
 very
 hard


uh
 to
 start
 things
 uh
 and
 that's
 because


there's
 two
 forms
 of
 uncertainty
 that


are
 exerting
 themselves
 on
 any
 decision


that
 we
 make
 the
 first
 is
 just
 plain


luck
 uh
 which
 means
 that
 we
 can
 make
 a


great
 decision
 we
 can
 make
 a
 decision


that's
 going
 to
 work
 out
 90%
 of
 the
 time


but
 10%
 of
 the
 time
 it's
 not
 going
 to


work
 out
 uh
 and
 when
 we
 observe
 that
 10%


is
 wholly
 determined
 by
 luck
 and
 that


makes
 it
 very
 hard
 for
 us
 to
 start


things
 because
 we're
 we're
 trying
 to
 get


more
 control
 than
 we
 actually
 have
 over


what
 the
 outcome
 might
 be
 uh
 which
 is


probabilistic
 in
 nature
 the
 other
 form


of
 uncertainty
 that
 makes
 the
 decision


to
 start
 things
 hard
 is
 that
 we
 know


very
 little
 in
 comparison
 to
 all
 there


is
 to
 be
 known
 and
 so
 this
 can
 make
 it


uh
 so
 that
 we
 really
 slow
 our
 decisions


down
 in
 a
 way
 that
 isn't
 actually


productive
 trying
 to
 get
 to
 a
 level
 of


certainty
 that
 is
 actually


unattainable
 so
 those
 two
 forms
 of


uncertainty
 are
 making
 starting
 things


hard
 the
 good
 news
 for
 us
 is
 that
 for


most
 things
 that
 we
 decide
 to
 do
 we
 have


the
 option
 to
 quit
 later
 uh
 that
 quit


might
 have
 varying
 varying
 costs


associated
 with
 it
 but
 almost
 anything


that
 we
 decide
 to
 start
 we
 can
 actually


quit
 and
 what
 that
 means
 is
 that
 the


uncertainty
 that
 that
 makes
 it
 really


hard
 for
 us
 to
 start
 things
 this
 option


to
 quit
 later
 makes
 that
 start
 easier


because
 we
 can
 anticipate
 the
 ability
 to


exit
 when
 we
 observe
 that
 the
 world


isn't
 going
 in
 our
 direction
 or
 when
 we


observe
 that
 we're
 getting
 signals
 that


we're
 learning
 new
 things
 that
 tell
 us


that
 our
 choice
 wasn't
 actually
 that


good
 so
 you
 can
 think
 about
 it
 like


we've
 all
 had
 that
 feeling
 of
 I
 wish
 I


knew
 then
 what
 I
 know
 now
 uh
 the
 option


to
 quit
 actually
 makes
 it
 so
 that
 we
 can


act
 on
 that
 feeling
 when
 we
 learn
 new


information
 but
 here's
 the
 really
 big


problem
 is
 that
 even
 though
 we
 have
 this


incredibly
 valuable
 option
 and
 I
 would


actually
 argue
 that
 it's
 the
 single
 most


valuable
 option
 that
 we
 have
 in


decision-
 making
 is
 this
 option
 to
 walk


away
 the
 problem
 is
 that
 we
 actually
 are


quite
 bad
 at
 quitting
 um
 we
 tend
 to
 walk


away
 from
 things
 uh
 much
 too
 late


compared
 to
 when
 if
 you
 were
 just


judging
 expected
 value
 would
 be
 the


correct
 time
 to
 actually
 walk
 away
 so


we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 this
 problem


that
 we
 have
 with
 quitting
 uh
 we're


going
 to
 talk
 about
 why
 it
 is
 that
 we
 uh


have
 such
 a
 problem
 with
 quitting
 and


then
 I'm
 going
 to
 hopefully
 give
 you


some
 solutions
 that
 are
 going
 to
 make


this
 all
 a
 little
 bit
 easier
 for
 you


okay
 so
 here's
 the
 important
 thing


remember
 I
 said
 after
 we
 start
 things
 we


get
 new


information
 and
 we
 have
 this
 very
 strong


intuition
 that
 when
 we
 get
 information


from
 the
 world
 that
 things
 aren't
 going


that
 well
 we'll
 actually
 pay
 attention


and
 walk
 away
 so
 when
 we
 get
 those


adverse
 signals
 we're
 going
 to
 stop
 what


we're
 doing
 and
 that's
 what
 we
 all
 think


but
 that
 intuition
 is
 actually
 wrong


instead
 in
 the
 face
 of
 those
 negative


signals
 we
 escalate
 our
 commitment
 and


actually
 in
 reference
 to
 the
 previous


speaker
 I
 use
 mountain
 climbing
 as
 an


example
 for
 this
 we've
 all
 heard
 of


fever
 we
 have
 the
 intuition
 that
 if
 it


gets
 dark
 and
 we're
 still
 climbing
 or
 if


a
 blizzard
 is
 coming
 in
 uh
 that
 we're


all
 going
 to
 stop
 climbing
 uh
 and
 it


turns
 out
 that
 we
 don't
 and
 you
 can
 just


look
 to
 for
 example
 uh
 1996
 on
 Mount


Everest
 to
 know
 that
 people
 will


continue
 past
 the
 point
 when
 they


already
 have
 um
 adverse
 signals
 1996


being
 that
 tragic
 year
 uh
 when
 Rob
 Hall


and
 Doug
 Hansen
 died
 so
 this
 is
 uh
 this


is
 a
 well
 uh
 known
 effect
 it's
 called


escalation
 of
 commitment
 that
 we
 get


these
 signals
 and
 instead
 of
 actually


reducing
 our
 commitment
 to
 the
 cause


having
 gotten
 those
 adverse
 signals
 we


actually
 escalate
 our
 commitment
 to
 the


cause
 and
 of
 course
 continuing
 to
 do


something
 that
 is
 no
 longer
 worthwhile


doesn't
 just
 have
 costs
 associated
 with


doing
 something
 that's
 negative


expectancy
 itself
 but
 there
 are
 also


opportunity
 costs
 associated
 with
 it
 so


we
 have
 this
 added
 cost
 of
 failure
 to


cut
 our
 losses
 that
 we
 can't
 take
 that


cap
 capit
 our
 time
 Attention
 our
 money


our
 effort
 and
 put
 it
 into
 something


that
 would
 actually
 be
 worthwhile
 so
 one


of
 the
 ways
 that
 we
 can
 think
 about
 the


uh
 grit
 and
 quit
 is
 not
 as
 oppositional


but
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 same
 decision
 uh
 we


should
 stick
 to
 things
 that
 are


worthwhile
 and
 we
 should
 quit
 things


that
 aren't
 and
 the
 failure
 to
 quit


things
 that
 are
 no
 longer
 worthwhile


also
 has
 opportunity
 costs
 associated


with
 it
 so
 this
 becomes
 even
 more


important
 to
 get
 this
 quit
 grit
 quit


decision
 down


now
 this
 is
 really
 important
 experts
 are


in
 no
 way
 immune
 to
 escalation
 of


commitment
 they're
 no
 way
 in
 no
 way


immune
 to
 this
 failure
 to
 quit
 things
 on


time
 there
 is
 lots
 and
 lots
 of
 data
 and


I've
 got
 three
 studies
 shown
 here
 Garvey


and
 Murphy
 uh
 Woodcock
 so
 and
 so
 forth


that
 show
 that
 while
 expert
 investors


are
 alpha
 generators
 when
 putting
 risk


on
 they
 give
 Alpha
 back
 on
 their
 exit


decisions
 uh
 and
 in
 fact
 this
 2023
 paper


shows
 that
 uh
 endowments
 when
 they
 put


positions
 on
 are
 generating
 between
 120


and
 180
 bips
 on
 those
 uh
 an
 alpha
 on


those
 decisions
 but
 their
 exit
 decisions


they're
 actually
 giving
 about
 70
 to
 80


bips
 back
 uh
 uh
 Woodcock
 and
 then
 also


Garvey
 and
 Murphy
 talk
 about
 the
 the


fact
 that
 uh
 intraday
 Traders
 are
 also


uh
 finding
 this
 and
 Alexus
 has
 shown


this
 as
 well
 uh
 very
 very
 good
 on
 the


entry
 uh
 giving
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 Alpha
 back


on
 the
 exit
 and
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 this


option
 to
 quit
 is
 so
 incredibly
 valuable


because
 this
 is
 the
 place
 where
 we
 can


actually
 pick
 up
 we
 can
 generate
 a
 lot


of
 alpha
 uh
 compared
 to
 our
 to
 compared


to
 our


competitors
 so
 why
 is
 it
 that
 it's
 so


hard
 for
 us
 to
 quit
 things
 well
 it
 turns


out
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 cognitive


biases
 that
 kind
 of
 pile
 up
 on
 top
 of
 us


that
 make
 us
 slow
 to
 quit
 I'm
 going
 to


walk
 through
 some
 of
 them
 pretty
 quickly


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 cover
 every
 single
 one


of
 them
 uh
 but
 with
 the
 some
 cost
 effect


endowment
 status
 quo
 bias
 Omission


commission
 bias
 optimism
 bias
 loss


aversion
 andure
 loss
 aversion
 so
 I'm


going
 to
 walk
 through
 these
 somewhat


quickly
 uh
 the
 sun
 cost
 effect
 uh
 is


when
 we
 take
 into
 account
 what
 we've


already
 spent
 on
 something
 and
 deciding


whether
 to
 continue
 on
 and
 spend
 more
 in


other
 words
 what
 happens
 is
 that
 we
 have


that
 feeling
 of
 we
 want
 to
 get
 our
 money


back
 or
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 wasted
 uh


what
 we
 already
 put
 into
 something
 the


problem
 of
 course
 is
 that
 waste
 is
 not
 a


retrospective
 problem
 it's
 a
 prospective


problem
 what
 we'd
 ideally
 like
 to
 do
 uh


is
 if
 it
 is
 something
 that
 we
 would


start
 today
 then
 we
 should
 be
 willing
 to


continue
 it
 if
 it
 is
 not
 something
 that


we
 would
 start
 today
 then
 we
 should
 not


continue
 it
 but
 what
 happens
 with
 sun


cost
 is
 that
 instead
 of
 this
 Forward


Thinking
 where
 we're
 saying
 is
 this


something
 that
 we
 would
 actually
 do


start
 today
 would
 we
 put
 this
 position


on
 today
 for
 example
 we
 take
 into


account
 what
 we've
 already
 put
 into
 it


and
 deciding
 whether
 to
 continue
 on
 and


and
 spend
 more
 now
 the
 problem
 is
 it


doesn't
 really
 matter
 uh
 what
 you've


lost
 coming
 up
 to
 that
 moment
 of
 the


decision
 what
 matters
 is
 whether
 the


next
 dollar
 or
 the
 next
 unit
 of
 effort


that
 we
 put
 into
 something
 is
 positive


expectancy
 so
 the
 sunk
 cost
 effect


causes
 us
 to
 continue
 things
 that
 are
 no


longer
 worthwhile
 we
 also
 have
 the


endowment
 effect
 which
 is
 just
 we
 value


things
 that
 we
 own
 more
 than
 identical


things
 uh
 that
 we
 don't
 own
 so
 the


things
 that
 we
 already
 have
 in
 our


portfolio
 the
 positions
 that
 we
 already


have
 on
 this
 is
 even
 true
 of
 our
 own


ideas
 uh
 the
 thesis
 that
 we're
 trading


uh
 the
 ideas
 that
 we
 have
 we
 value
 more


than
 things
 that
 don't
 we
 don't
 own
 so


obviously
 when
 we're
 making
 that


decision
 about
 whether
 it's
 worthwhile


to
 continue
 on
 we're
 going
 to
 distort


our
 view
 of
 what
 the
 expected
 value
 is


uh
 just
 because
 we
 think
 that
 the
 things


that
 we
 own
 are
 more
 valuable
 that
 they


have
 more
 value
 to
 them
 um
 then
 we
 have


sh
 loss
 aversion
 this
 comes
 from
 the


late
 Danny
 Conan
 and
 and
 Amos
 tersi
 uh


which
 is
 essentially
 this
 problem
 that


we're
 biased
 against
 converting
 paper


losses
 into
 realized
 losses
 and
 we'll


actually
 pay
 to
 avoid
 having
 to
 do
 so
 so


this
 is
 from
 their
 original
 1979
 paper


on
 prospect
 theory
 uh
 which
 shows
 that


when
 people
 are
 in
 the
 losses
 on
 a


gamble
 uh
 say
 I've
 lost
 $100
 um
 and
 I'm


offered
 a
 Fair
 coin
 flip
 uh
 where
 I
 can


either
 get
 even
 or
 I'll
 lose


$220
 that
 they'll
 prefer
 to
 take
 the


flip
 there
 in
 other
 words
 they're
 paying


$10
 for
 the
 opportunity
 to
 try
 to
 get


even
 and
 that's
 because
 of
 this
 aversion


to
 turning
 a
 paper
 loss
 into
 a
 sure
 loss


and
 obviously
 that's
 a
 huge
 problem
 when


we're
 in
 the
 losses
 on
 a
 position
 that


we're
 holding
 and
 we
 can
 kind
 of
 think


of
 all
 of
 those
 under
 this
 umbrella
 of


we
 just
 don't
 like
 to
 close
 accounts
 in


the
 losses
 and
 it's
 not
 just
 paper


accounts
 this
 has
 to
 do
 with
 our
 mental


accounts
 so
 we
 can
 have
 a
 paper
 account


that's
 in
 the
 gains
 and
 yet
 our
 mental


account
 is
 in
 the
 losses
 if
 we
 buy
 a


stock
 at
 50
 it
 goes
 up
 to
 to
 75
 and
 then


it
 goes
 down
 to
 60
 mentally
 we're
 in
 the


losses
 even
 though
 on
 our
 paper
 Ledger


we're
 in
 the
 gains
 and
 so
 this
 problem


with
 not
 wanting
 to
 close
 accounts
 in


the
 losses
 makes
 us
 very
 slow
 to
 quit
 we


also
 have
 status
 quo
 bias
 a
 preference


for
 sticking
 with
 the
 status
 quo


Omission
 commission
 bias
 we're
 much
 more


tolerant
 of
 losses
 that
 come
 from


sticking
 with
 the
 status
 quo
 in
 other


words
 making
 a
 decision
 not
 to
 switch
 uh


as
 opposed
 to
 making
 a
 decision
 to


switch
 so
 if
 we're
 holding
 a
 position


we're
 going
 to
 be
 be
 more
 tolerant
 of


the
 losses
 that
 might
 generate
 from
 that


uh
 then
 we
 are
 going
 to
 be
 tolerant
 of


generating
 from
 losses
 uh
 that
 come
 from


us
 switching
 from
 that
 position
 to


something
 new
 which
 also
 makes
 us
 very


slow
 to
 quit
 and
 then
 the
 last
 thing
 is


just
 cognitive
 ident
 dissonance
 identity


and
 validity
 both
 both
 uh
 the
 way
 we


view
 ourselves
 and
 the
 way
 that
 other


people
 uh
 view
 us
 uh
 we
 want
 to
 be
 seen


as
 consistent
 individuals
 over
 time
 uh


part
 of
 the
 decisions
 that
 we
 make


create
 part
 of
 our
 identity
 and
 that's


particularly
 true
 if
 those
 decisions
 are


making
 us
 stand
 out
 from
 the
 crowd
 so


Bashir
 and
 and
 Milkman
 showed
 that
 when


analysts
 take
 positions
 that
 are


non-consensus
 uh
 on
 earnings
 forecasts


uh
 when
 they're
 non-consensus
 and
 the


World
 Turns
 against
 them
 and
 gives
 them


information
 that
 their
 forecast
 actually


wasn't
 correct
 they'll
 actually
 double


down
 on
 the
 forecast
 but
 when
 they
 make


uh
 when
 they
 make
 uh
 forecasts
 that
 are


in
 consensus
 they're
 perfectly
 willing


to
 change
 according
 to
 what
 the
 world


tells
 them
 and
 that's
 because
 the


non-consensus
 uh
 forecasts
 are
 actually


much
 more
 part
 of
 somebody's
 identity


and
 obviously
 as
 Traders
 um
 or
 as


investors
 we're
 investing
 against
 the


market
 uh
 so
 we're
 often
 trying
 to
 stand


out
 from
 the
 crowd
 do
 something
 where
 we


think
 that
 the
 market
 is
 not
 efficient


and
 that
 makes
 it
 actually
 much
 harder


for
 us
 to
 walk
 away
 because
 it's
 an


attack
 on
 our
 identity
 if
 we
 actually


have
 to
 jump


ship
 okay
 so
 I
 told
 you
 a
 lot
 of
 the


reasons
 why
 we
 don't
 stop
 now
 I
 want
 to


give
 you
 quickly
 a
 few
 reasons
 how
 we


can
 help
 you
 to
 get
 better
 at
 these


stopping
 decisions
 the
 first
 is
 to
 set


very
 specific
 kill
 criteria
 which
 are


just
 criteria
 for
 killing
 a
 project


cutting
 your
 losses
 or
 changing
 a
 plan


uh
 so
 the
 first
 step
 is
 to
 identify
 the


way
 that
 things
 might
 go
 wrong
 or
 right


uh
 and
 then
 identify
 the
 early
 warning


signals
 to
 develop
 a
 list
 of
 kill


criteria
 in
 other
 words
 what
 are
 those


signals
 that
 I
 think
 I
 might
 ignore
 in


the
 future
 that
 would
 tell
 me
 that
 it's


time
 to
 walk
 away
 and
 then
 pre-commit
 to


your
 reaction
 to
 those
 criteria
 so
 I've


worked
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 investors
 and
 they


have
 that
 intuition
 while
 I
 have
 a


thesis
 uh
 and
 let's
 say
 the
 thesis
 has


to
 do
 with
 uh
 the
 directional
 movement


of
 interest
 rates
 so
 they
 their
 thesis


is
 that
 interest
 rates
 are
 going
 to
 go


above
 above
 a
 certain
 uh
 uh
 Point
 um
 or


stay
 within
 a
 particular
 band
 or
 go
 down


whatever
 that
 thesis
 is
 they
 have
 the


intuitions
 that
 that
 when
 interest
 rates


move
 against
 them
 that
 they
 will
 get
 off


the
 position
 that
 they
 will
 take
 risk


off
 uh
 but
 we
 know
 that
 they
 don't
 they


tend
 to
 get
 thesis
 creep
 or
 they


escalate
 our
 commitment
 or
 they
 say
 now


it's
 really
 cheap
 I
 know
 my
 forast
 is


still
 correct
 uh
 and
 so
 um
 what
 I'm


doing
 here
 is
 saying
 okay
 if
 you
 have
 a


thesis
 that
 thesis
 is
 implying
 certain


things
 about
 what
 the
 world
 is
 going
 to


look
 like
 in
 the
 future
 write
 down
 what


that
 thesis
 is
 actually
 implying
 and


then
 develop
 kill
 criteria
 in
 other


words
 if
 interest
 rates
 move
 out
 of
 a


certain
 band


then
 I
 will
 do
 X
 Y
 or
 Z
 so
 if
 they
 go


above
 a
 certain
 band
 maybe
 I'll
 put
 more


risk
 on
 but
 if
 they
 go
 below
 a
 certain


band
 that
 means
 that
 the
 world
 has
 moved


against
 my
 thesis
 and
 I
 need
 to
 actually


take
 the
 risk
 off
 now
 that
 might
 seem


like
 a
 distinction
 without
 a
 difference


if
 I
 have
 a
 thesis
 it's
 predicting


certain
 things
 about
 the
 future
 uh
 why


is
 it
 different
 if
 I
 just
 write
 those


things
 down
 and
 pre-commit
 to
 them
 and


it
 turns
 out
 just
 cognitively
 that
 makes


a
 huge
 difference
 uh
 to
 think
 ahead


actually
 identify
 what
 those
 kill


criteria
 are
 and
 then
 and
 then


pre-commit
 to
 to
 the
 actions
 that
 you're


going
 to
 take
 when
 you
 see
 those
 signals


develop
 the
 next
 thing
 is
 to
 create


better
 feedback
 loops
 one
 of
 the


problems
 that
 we
 have
 on
 the
 quits
 when


we
 take
 risk
 off
 is
 that
 we
 really
 don't


have
 a
 good
 feedback
 loop
 on
 how
 those


decisions
 compare
 to
 a
 benchmark
 so
 we


consistently
 track
 positions
 we
 have


on
 and
 obviously
 because
 they're
 in
 our


portfolio
 we
 also
 even
 uh
 track


positions
 that
 we're
 considering
 putting


on
 because
 we'll
 create
 Shadow
 books
 but


what
 we
 don't
 do
 is
 consistently
 track


positions
 that
 we
 take
 off
 so
 what
 we


want
 to
 do
 is
 create
 a
 benchmark
 W


against
 which
 we
 can
 actually
 measure


the
 quality
 of
 our
 quitting
 decisions
 so


we
 can
 do
 that
 in
 a
 couple
 ways
 one


thing
 is
 for
 example
 if
 we're
 freeing
 up


Capital
 uh
 we
 can
 create
 a
 benchmark


which
 is
 what
 if
 I
 randomly
 freed
 this


Capital
 app
 from
 anywhere
 in
 my


portfolio
 and
 actually
 judge
 my
 quit


decision
 against
 that
 over
 the
 course
 of


a
 period
 of
 time
 uh
 you
 can
 also


actually
 start
 to
 uh
 track
 your
 your
 um


uh
 things
 that
 you
 hold
 and
 look
 at
 uh


what
 would
 have
 happened
 if
 I
 had


actually
 sold
 those
 things
 earlier
 at


the
 time
 that
 I
 considered
 it
 but
 be


creative
 and
 try
 to
 actually
 create


benchmarks
 against
 which
 you
 can


actually
 start
 to
 judge
 your
 quitting


decisions
 so
 that
 you
 can
 start
 to
 get


feedback
 on
 whether
 you're
 generating


Alpha
 on
 those
 exit
 decisions
 or
 giving


Alpha
 back
 on
 those
 exit


decisions
 and
 the
 last
 is
 uh
 this
 is
 a


big
 favorite
 of
 mine
 go
 get
 yourself
 a


quitting
 coach
 because
 an
 honest
 broker


someone
 who's
 standing
 on
 the
 outside


looking
 in
 on
 your
 situation
 is
 going
 to


see
 your
 situation
 more
 clearly
 than
 you


can
 and
 the
 reason
 is
 that
 they're
 not


carrying
 all
 of
 the
 sunk
 cost
 they're


not
 carrying
 the
 endowment
 they
 don't


they
 don't
 have
 the
 same
 kind
 of
 biases


piled
 up
 on
 them
 that
 are
 making
 them


not
 be
 able
 to
 see
 that
 situation
 so


clearly
 so
 someone
 from
 the
 outside


looking
 in
 is
 going
 to
 see
 your


situation
 more
 clearly
 than
 you
 can
 and


so
 if
 you
 work
 with
 them
 to
 pre-commit


to
 an
 exit
 plan
 with
 a
 quitting
 coach
 it


actually
 makes
 it
 more
 likely
 that


you'll
 follow
 through
 so
 they
 can
 both


see
 the
 decision
 more
 clearly
 than
 you


can
 and
 they
 create
 accountability
 that


are
 going
 to
 make
 you
 actually
 follow


through
 on
 those
 quitting
 plans
 so


actually
 when
 I've
 worked
 with
 for


example
 solo
 PMS
 I've
 paired
 them


together
 so
 that
 they
 can
 coach
 each


other
 on
 these
 exit
 decisions
 so
 I
 hope


that
 this
 uh
 bit
 about
 exiting
 uh
 you're


going
 to
 find
 helpful
 uh
 I
 really


believe
 that
 this
 could
 be
 the
 the


single
 biggest
 uh
 Alpha
 generator
 for


you
 right
 now
 in
 your
 own
 investing
 life


uh
 because
 we
 are
 so
 bad
 at
 it
 and


nobody's
 really
 paying
 attention
 to
 how


good
 these
 exit
 decisions
 are
 so
 if
 you


can
 get
 better
 at
 these
 exit
 decisions
 I


think
 this
 is
 G
 this
 uh
 will
 vastly


improve
 your
 returns
 thank
 you
 so
 much


so
 a
 great
 thanks
 to
 Annie
 for
 sharing


thoughts
 on
 how
 and
 when
 to
 quit
 it's
 a


pleasure
 to
 introduce
 the
 next
 speaker


Michael
 maosin
 from
 Morgan
 Stanley


Michael
 is
 an
 Wall
 Street
 investment


strategist
 he's
 an
 author
 and
 he
 is
 an


Adjunct
 professor
 at
 Columbia
 business


school
 now
 Michael
 is
 known
 for
 his


ability
 to
 turn
 complex
 idas
 into


strikingly
 simple
 language
 so
 with
 that


Michael


[Applause]


[Music]


please
 good
 afternoon
 everybody
 it's


really
 great
 to
 be
 with
 you
 the
 goal
 of


my
 session
 is
 to
 talk
 about
 two
 very


specific
 blocks
 to
 potentially
 poor


decisions
 and
 what
 the
 best
 investors
 do


to
 overcome
 them
 the
 goal
 of
 session
 two


is
 to
 be
 very
 practical
 I
 hope
 when
 you


go
 back
 to
 your
 desks


you'll
 immediately
 be
 able
 to
 implement


some
 of
 these
 ideas
 and
 ultimately
 make


better


decisions
 Adam
 Grant
 mentioned
 earlier


today
 the
 good
 judgment
 project
 a


project
 at
 University
 of
 Pennsylvania
 on


forecasting
 turns
 out
 they
 did
 something


very
 interesting
 when
 forecasters
 uh


volunteered
 to
 participate
 in
 their


project
 they
 either
 uh
 in
 control
 gave


them
 no
 training
 or
 they
 gave
 them
 some


training
 and
 the
 question
 was
 did
 the


training
 make
 them
 better
 at
 making


better
 forecasts
 and
 the
 answer
 to
 that


was
 yes


but
 it's
 actually
 somewhat
 qualified


there
 are
 different
 flavors
 of
 training


that
 have
 different
 impacts
 the
 first
 is


just
 giving
 people
 information
 about


heuristics
 and
 biases
 and
 it
 turns
 out


you
 could
 do
 a
 couple
 experiments
 it


turns
 out
 it's
 really
 fun
 for
 people


they
 enjoy
 it
 and
 then
 they
 walk
 back
 to


their
 desk
 they
 do
 exactly
 what
 they


were
 doing
 before
 so
 it
 doesn't
 change


any
 Behavior
 the
 two
 that
 we
 want
 to


focus
 on
 is
 process
 so
 very
 specific


tools
 and
 techniques
 we
 can't
 um
 work
 on


to
 uncover
 biases
 and
 then
 finally


giving
 people
 feedback
 certainly
 a
 theme


that's
 coming
 through
 a
 lot
 today
 there


is
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 formats
 so
 how
 you


can
 reframe
 problems
 I'll
 give
 you
 one


example
 that's
 a
 little
 bit
 in
 that
 in


that
 flavor
 but
 we're
 going
 to
 focus


mostly
 on
 process
 and


feedback
 so
 let's
 jump
 into
 this
 I
 think


the
 first
 very
 big
 barrier
 to
 making


good
 decisions
 is
 the
 notion
 of


overconfidence
 and
 I
 think
 the
 best


investors
 are
 are
 very
 good
 at


overcoming


this
 now
 it
 turns
 out
 overconfidence


which
 is
 often
 considered
 the
 root
 of


all
 problems
 comes
 again
 in
 different


varieties
 the
 first
 I'll
 say
 the
 the


very
 bottom
 is
 this
 idea
 of


overplacement
 people
 think
 of
 themselves


as
 better
 than
 they
 are
 versus
 others
 so


you've
 all
 heard
 this
 you
 know
 I'm
 above


average
 driver
 or
 my
 sense
 of
 humor
 is


better
 than
 90%
 of
 other
 people
 the


other
 is
 idea
 of
 overestimation
 which


people
 absolutely
 think
 they're
 better


at
 certain
 tasks
 you
 know
 so
 I
 can
 make


this
 seven
 foot
 foot
 put
 or
 whatever
 it


is
 so
 overplacement
 but
 the
 one
 that


we're
 most
 interested
 in
 I
 think
 is
 this


concept
 of
 overprecision


we
 actually
 think
 we
 understand
 the


future
 better
 than
 we
 actually
 do
 and
 I


think
 the
 really
 good
 investors
 are


those
 that
 can
 combat
 and
 overcome
 that


let
 me
 give
 you
 an
 example
 of
 how
 this


works
 this
 is
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 test
 of


calibration
 and
 some
 degree
 a
 test
 of


overconfidence
 um
 by
 the
 way
 the
 URL
 is


down
 there
 if
 you
 can't
 find
 it
 or
 see


it
 just
 let
 me
 know
 it's
 a
 very
 fun


exercise
 to
 do
 in
 your
 own
 organization


or
 with
 your
 loved


ones
 it's


a
 it's
 50
 true
 false
 questions
 some
 of


which
 you'll
 know
 the
 answer
 to
 many
 of


which
 you
 will
 not
 know
 the
 answer
 to
 so


you
 answer
 true
 false
 and
 then
 you
 give


a
 confidence
 100%
 means
 I
 know
 the


answer
 to
 this
 question
 50%
 means
 I


don't
 know
 the
 answer
 and
 I'm
 guessing


right
 so
 this
 is
 the
 basic
 setup
 now


we've
 had
 now
 about
 20,000
 people
 do


this
 exercise
 and
 this
 is
 the
 scatter


plot
 of
 all
 the
 responses
 by
 the
 way
 I


do
 want
 to
 mention
 two
 and
 I'm
 sure


they're
 guys
 I'm
 going
 to
 mention
 two


guys
 that
 are
 my
 two
 favorite
 dots
 the


one
 is
 the
 upper
 right
 hand
 corner
 which


is
 100%
 correct
 and
 100%
 confident
 so


this
 this
 guy
 Googled
 everyone
 and
 like


the
 second
 guy
 that
 was
 even
 better
 is


in
 the
 bottom
 right
 hand
 corner
 who
 is


35%
 correct
 and
 95%
 confident
 you
 just
 H


true
 true
 true
 true
 you
 do
 better
 than


that
 guy


did
 now
 the
 goal
 of
 this
 exercise
 is
 not


to
 be
 right
 about
 every
 question
 if
 you


can
 be
 right
 that's
 great
 but
 the
 goal


of
 the
 exercise
 as
 you
 might
 imagine
 is


to
 know
 what
 you
 know
 and
 to
 know
 what


you
 don't
 know
 the
 goal
 of
 the
 exercise


is
 to
 lie
 as
 close
 to
 the
 45
 degree


angle
 line
 as
 possible
 now
 even
 people


in
 the
 very
 back
 in
 the
 room
 can


probably
 see
 this
 when
 I
 give
 you
 the


numbers
 you
 won't
 be
 shocked
 to
 hear


this
 the
 average
 confidence
 is
 70%
 and


the
 average
 correct
 is
 about
 60%
 people


are
 10
 percentage
 points
 overconfident


in
 their
 own
 judgments
 now
 let's
 unpack


that
 a
 little
 bit
 to
 see
 if
 there's


anything
 interesting
 well
 the
 first
 is


the
 distribution
 of
 overconfidence


versus
 underconfidence
 by
 the
 way
 I


mentioned
 this
 10%
 overconfidence
 it


turns
 out
 the
 the
 the
 standard
 deviation


is
 also
 10
 so
 it's
 a
 beautiful
 shaped


Bell
 distribution
 when
 you
 have
 this


many
 people
 and
 about
 82
 82
 83%
 of


people
 are
 overconfident
 that's


something
 we
 see
 very
 consistently
 by


the
 way
 as
 a
 side
 note
 and
 I'm
 glad


you're
 all
 sitting
 to
 hear
 this


information
 men
 tend
 to
 be
 more


overconfident
 than


women
 and
 young
 men
 tend
 to
 be
 more


confident
 than
 older
 men
 so
 there's
 some


patterns
 there
 now
 this
 is
 where
 it
 gets


really
 interesting
 it
 turns
 out
 that
 uh


how
 do
 people
 answer
 when
 they're
 doing


this
 exercise
 right
 so
 again
 you're


getting
 50%
 means
 I
 guess
 I
 don't
 know


the
 answer
 to
 100%
 so
 it
 turns
 out
 when


people
 don't
 know
 the
 answer
 they
 they


know
 they
 don't
 know
 the
 answer
 and
 they


answer
 they
 don't
 know
 the
 answer
 so


they're
 actually
 pretty
 they
 about
 40%


of
 the
 aners
 is
 is
 I
 don't
 know
 which
 is


fine
 what's
 fascinating
 is
 the
 second


most
 common
 response
 is
 I've
 got
 this


I'm
 100%
 sure
 I
 know
 the
 answer
 so


between
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 what's
 going
 on


and
 I
 know
 the
 answer
 is
 about


two-thirds
 of
 all
 responses
 and
 people


are
 very
 sparing
 in
 using
 those


intermediate
 ranges
 by
 the
 way
 as
 Adam


was
 talking
 about
 super
 forecasters
 he


alluded
 to
 this
 but
 super
 forecasters


are
 much
 better
 at
 updating
 their
 views


and
 being
 more
 uh
 granular
 and
 actually


setting
 their
 for
 casts
 okay
 so
 how
 do


people
 do
 given
 their
 confidence
 well


this
 is
 the
 most
 fascinating
 chart
 turns


out
 when
 people
 don't
 know
 the
 answer


again
 they
 don't
 they
 answer
 they
 don't


answer
 and
 they're
 pretty
 well


calibrated
 at
 I
 don't
 know
 but
 as
 you


move
 from
 left
 to
 right
 on
 this
 chart


you
 see
 this
 systematic
 departure
 from


the
 45
 degree
 angle
 line
 when
 people
 are


100%
 sure
 they
 know
 the
 answer
 they're


only
 right
 77%
 of
 the
 time
 when
 they
 are


90%
 sure
 they're
 only
 right
 2third
 of


the
 time
 right
 there's
 this
 yawning
 Gap


especially
 in
 this
 range
 of
 I
 am
 very


sure
 what's
 going
 on
 Howard
 marks


remarked
 about
 this
 just
 this
 morning


that
 this
 is
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 Mark
 Twain


thing
 when
 you're
 very
 confident
 about


something
 you're
 wrong
 about
 it
 this
 is


where
 trouble
 can
 can
 arise
 this
 is
 also


very
 very
 important
 for
 uh
 portfolio


construction


concepts
 by
 the
 way
 there's
 an


interesting
 uh
 just
 this
 there's
 a
 brand


new
 paper
 about
 this
 but
 there's
 a
 new


survey
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 group
 called


the
 survey
 of
 professional
 uh


forecasters
 that
 forecast
 economic


things
 this
 is
 unemployment
 rates
 and


interest
 rates
 and
 so
 forth
 and
 they


have
 a
 data
 set
 going
 back
 to
 1968
 so
 55


or
 60
 years
 of
 data
 on
 this
 and
 it's
 the


exact
 same
 thing
 they
 say
 what's
 going


to
 happen
 with
 this
 thing
 with
 some
 sort


of
 probability
 and
 here
 again
 these
 are


professional
 forecasters
 and
 here
 you


see
 this
 exact
 same
 pattern


unfold
 high
 confidence
 uh
 poor


conviction
 now
 why
 is
 this
 uh
 you
 know


what's
 it
 what's
 exciting
 about
 this
 on


the
 other
 hand
 is
 uh
 going
 back
 to
 the


concept
 of
 feedback
 is
 it
 turns
 out
 when


people
 get
 feedback
 on
 their
 forecast


they
 get
 better
 at
 it
 over
 time
 so
 this


is
 a
 picture
 of
 actually
 weather


forecasters
 the
 the
 line
 the
 line
 at
 the


bottom
 is
 actually
 the
 first
 year
 they


did
 this
 and
 these
 are
 large
 sample


sizes
 and
 then
 the
 next
 year
 they


repeated
 the
 exercise
 with
 the
 feedback


from
 the
 first
 year
 and
 you
 can
 see
 they


got
 markedly
 better
 so
 this
 should
 be


very
 encouraging
 to
 all
 of
 us
 that
 if
 we


practice
 and
 get
 the
 feedback
 we
 get


better
 at
 this
 right
 but
 keeping
 track


of
 your
 decisions
 is
 really
 crucial
 to


this
 okay
 so
 what's
 going
 on
 how
 can
 we


improve
 broadly
 speaker
 what
 are
 the


best
 investors
 do
 uh
 Annie
 mentioned


Danny
 conoman
 we
 all
 mourn
 his
 loss
 he


was
 extraordinary
 but
 one
 of
 the


concepts
 of
 Danny
 popularize
 is
 this


idea
 of
 the
 inside
 versus
 the
 outside


view
 see
 the
 inside
 inside
 view
 says


when
 I
 give
 you
 a
 problem
 it
 could
 be


any
 kind
 of
 problem
 the
 classic
 way
 to


solve
 this
 see
 if
 this
 makes
 sense
 to


you
 is
 you
 gather
 lots
 of
 information


you
 combine
 it
 with
 your
 own


experience
 and
 then
 you
 project
 into
 the


future
 right
 left
 door
 devices
 that's


what
 we
 do
 information
 my
 experience


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 the
 world
 the


outside
 view
 by
 contrast
 says
 I'm
 going


to
 think
 about
 my
 problem
 as
 an
 instance


of
 a
 larger
 reference
 class
 I'm
 going
 to


ask
 what
 happen
 when
 other
 people
 were


in
 this
 situation
 before
 it's
 a
 very


unnatural
 way
 to
 think
 about
 the
 world


right
 because
 you
 have
 to
 leave
 aside


your
 chairish
 information
 and
 you
 have


to
 find
 an
 appeal
 to
 the
 base
 rate
 what


psychologists
 like
 Conan
 have


demonstrated
 is
 some
 combination
 of
 the


inside
 and
 the
 outside
 view
 um
 lead
 to


better
 forecasts
 let
 me
 give
 you
 one


example
 from
 the
 world
 of
 business
 this


is
 pelaton
 right
 and
 this
 is
 an
 analyst


report
 that
 was
 written
 in
 September


2020
 so
 please
 roll
 your
 mind
 back
 three


and
 a
 half
 years
 to
 the
 middle
 of
 the


pandemic
 they
 were
 doing
 they
 were
 doing


great
 because
 everybody
 wanted
 to


exercise
 while
 they
 were
 at
 home
 they


had
 just
 come
 finished
 a
 blockbuster


year
 2020
 and
 the
 analyst
 wrote
 his


report
 that
 our
 base
 case
 scenario


they're
 going
 to
 grow
 Revenue
 30%
 for


the
 next
 decade
 and
 by
 the
 way
 it's
 a


very
 I
 mean
 I'm
 tell
 the
 guy
 it's
 a


serious
 model
 he's
 got
 it's
 all
 built


out
 you
 know
 it's
 like
 it's
 actually


quite
 incedible
 so
 there's
 that
 his


inside
 view
 now
 the
 question
 you
 are


going
 to
 ask
 hopefully
 using
 the
 Danny


conman
 mindset
 is
 how
 many
 companies


with
 $2
 billion
 of
 turnover
 grew
 30%
 a


year
 for
 10
 years
 and
 here
 are
 the
 data


on


this
 I
 put
 the
 peleton
 bike
 the
 actual


the
 guy's
 forecast
 um
 but
 you
 could
 see


the
 average
 is
 about
 6%
 the
 standard


deviation
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 than
 that


this
 is
 the
 guy's
 base
 case
 so
 you
 might


say
 if
 he's
 wildly
 optimistic
 he
 should


certainly
 have
 a
 scenario
 for
 that
 but


that
 certainly
 would
 not
 be
 your
 base


case
 right
 so
 this
 gives
 you
 an
 example


of
 how
 you
 might
 temper
 that
 there's
 a


great
 quote
 from
 Danny
 conman
 by
 the
 way


which
 really
 applies
 to
 investor
 he
 says


people
 who
 know
 uh
 information
 about


their
 own
 individual
 circumstances
 feel


no
 need
 effectively
 to
 appeal
 to
 the


base
 case
 the
 reference
 class
 to
 which


it
 belongs
 right
 you
 feel
 like
 I've
 done


the
 work
 I
 don't
 need
 to
 know
 what


happened
 in
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 when


we
 know
 combining
 these
 two
 things
 is


very
 powerful
 so
 why
 do
 we
 do
 this
 uh
 a


few
 reasons
 one
 is
 Annie
 just
 mentioned


one
 of
 them
 one
 is
 called
 uh
 three


Illusions
 one
 is
 called
 the
 illusion
 of


superior
 it
 we
 tend
 to
 think
 of


ourselves
 as
 better
 than
 those
 around
 us


by
 the
 way
 why
 do
 I
 have
 a
 picture
 of


Mother


Teresa
 25
 years
 ago
 US
 News
 and
 Ro


report
 did
 a
 survey
 of
 thousand


Americans
 and
 they
 said
 what's
 the


probability
 of
 going
 to
 heaven
 and
 they


talked
 about
 like
 they
 ask
 about
 Michael


you
 know
 Michael
 Jordan
 and
 all
 these


people
 anyway
 Mother
 Teresa
 scored
 79%


which
 seemed
 a
 little
 low
 to
 me
 by
 the


way
 she's
 now
 a
 saint
 so
 maybe
 people


bump
 it
 up
 but
 this
 is
 the
 best
 Mother


Teresa
 79
 they
 said
 you
 uh
 survey
 answer


what
 is
 the
 probably
 you
 go
 to
 heaven


87%
 Mother
 Teresa
 I
 promise
 you
 I
 would


not
 answer
 higher
 than
 brother
 Teresa
 um


the
 second
 is
 the
 illusion
 of
 optimism


it
 tends
 to
 be
 we
 tend
 to
 be
 very


optimistic
 about
 uh
 our
 our
 outcomes


that
 are
 important
 to
 us
 and
 so
 as
 a


consequence
 we
 tend
 to
 over
 calibrate


our
 success
 and
 then
 the
 illusion
 of


control
 this
 is
 good
 and
 when
 we
 when
 we


deem
 ourselves
 in
 control
 situation
 we


think
 our
 odds
 and
 success
 are
 much


higher
 than
 they
 are
 objectively
 uh


turns
 out
 when
 they
 go
 to
 Las
 Vegas


watch
 people
 rolling
 dice
 when
 they
 want


High
 numbers
 they
 throw
 them
 really
 hard


when
 they
 want
 low
 numbers
 they
 throw


them
 very
 gently
 doesn't
 work
 by
 the
 way


but
 just
 this
 idea
 of
 being
 in
 control


of
 the


situation
 here's
 the
 last
 thing
 I'll
 say


in
 this
 which
 you
 can
 all
 relate
 to


which
 is
 statist
 this
 is
 statistical


thinking
 and
 it
 turns
 out
 in
 the
 real


world
 what
 carries
 the
 day
 are


stories
 your
 parents
 told
 you
 stories


you
 tell
 stories
 to
 your
 children


stories
 move
 people
 stories
 teach
 people


stories
 are
 memorable
 statistics
 are
 not


so
 this
 is
 an
 interesting
 experiment


where
 they
 went
 to
 people
 they
 said
 you


have
 a
 disease
 you
 have
 a
 treatment


alternative
 it's
 always
 50/50
 so
 you


have
 that
 in
 your
 back
 pocket
 and
 then


they
 said
 we're
 going
 to
 give
 you
 or


they're
 going
 to
 show
 you
 one
 of
 four


Alternatives
 30
 50
 70
 or
 90%
 probability


of
 success
 so
 this
 is
 you
 see
 one
 of


those
 but
 the
 key
 is
 they
 paired
 it
 with


a
 story
 that
 was
 positive
 negative
 or


neutral
 about
 someone
 like
 you
 right
 so


hopefully
 I'm
 making
 myself
 clear's
 got


5050
 you're
 getting
 30
 neutral
 K
 so
 here


let
 me
 just
 draw
 your
 attention
 to
 the


extremes
 if
 you
 give
 people
 a
 positive


anecdote
 they
 select
 the
 30%


Effectiveness
 now
 30
 versus
 50
 they


selected
 almost
 eight
 out
 of
 10
 times


if
 you
 give
 them
 a
 negative
 anecdote


they
 select
 the
 90
 now
 90
 vers
 50
 they


select
 it
 less
 than
 four
 out
 of
 10


times
 the
 stories
 swamp
 the
 statistics


in
 people
 making
 decisions
 by
 the
 way


extremely
 important
 as
 Leaders
 very


important
 for
 you
 as
 you
 think
 about


stocks
 and
 narratives
 that
 go
 around


them
 let
 me
 now
 turn
 to
 the
 second
 U


major
 problem
 this
 is
 very
 much
 involved


with
 what
 Annie
 was
 just
 talking
 about


uh
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 it's
 confirmation


bias
 confirmation
 bias
 as
 you
 all
 know


even
 if
 you
 struggle
 to
 make
 a
 decision


once
 you've
 made
 a
 decision
 you
 seek


information
 that
 confirms
 your
 point
 of


view
 and
 you
 discount
 dismiss
 or
 disavow


information
 that
 does
 not
 support
 your


point
 of
 view
 now
 there's
 a
 very


interesting
 point
 about
 confirmation


bias
 it
 turns
 out
 almost
 all
 the
 biases


heris
 and
 biases
 that
 are
 out
 there
 that


con
 and
 trki
 identified
 are
 mitigated
 to


some
 degree
 by
 intelligence
 so
 if
 you're


you're
 a
 smarter
 person
 on
 average
 you


learn
 about
 them
 you
 tend
 to
 do
 better


the
 one
 that
 that's
 not
 true
 Forest


confirmation
 bias
 this
 affects
 everybody


no
 matter
 who
 they
 are
 and
 how
 bright


they
 are


2005
 was
 the
 first
 chance
 I
 ever
 had
 to


meet
 Danny
 Conan
 it
 was
 an
 extraordinary


day
 an
 extraordinary
 session
 at
 the
 very


end
 of
 him
 I
 said
 Danny
 if
 there's
 one


thing
 a
 investor
 can
 do
 to
 improve
 his


or
 her
 results
 what
 would
 it
 be
 without


hesitation
 he
 said
 you
 must
 keep
 a


journal
 of
 your
 decisions
 write
 down


what
 you
 think
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 why


you
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 happen
 he
 said


WR
 write
 the
 date
 and
 time
 he
 said
 by


the
 way
 note
 how
 you
 feel
 physically
 and


emotionally
 about
 this
 but
 the
 most


important
 thing
 is
 as
 you're
 expressing


your
 variant
 perception
 as
 you're


expressing
 your
 view
 that's
 different


than
 what's
 in
 the
 market
 for
 an


investment
 for
 specifically
 he
 said


communicate
 using


probabilities
 not
 words
 because
 if
 you


use
 words
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 vague


enough
 that
 you
 can
 uh
 massage
 them


after
 the
 fact
 but
 if
 it's
 a
 probability


it
 allows
 you
 to
 keep
 score
 and
 here's


one
 thing
 I
 would
 say
 if
 you're
 going
 to


do
 a
 probabilistic
 forecast
 you
 want


three
 elements
 one
 is
 an
 outcome
 that
 we


can
 agree
 upon
 second
 within
 a
 specific


period
 of
 time
 and
 then
 with
 some


probability
 probability
 so
 you
 might
 say


for
 example
 weather
 is
 a
 good
 for


example
 Tomorrow
 there's
 an
 80%
 chance


it's
 going
 to
 rain
 tomorrow
 right
 so


that
 would
 satisfy
 that
 if
 you
 have


those
 three
 ingredients
 you
 are
 in


business
 for
 doing
 uh
 probabilistic


forecasts
 now
 to
 give
 you
 some
 sense
 of


how
 Wild
 this
 can
 be
 uh
 I
 did
 a
 survey


with
 my
 older
 son
 we
 U
 asked
 20
 we
 put


out
 23
 common
 words
 or
 phrases
 to
 a


population
 of
 people
 and
 we
 asked
 them


say
 what's
 the
 associated
 probability


you'd
 assign
 to
 this
 word
 or
 phrase
 and


what
 you
 can
 see
 the
 answers
 are
 all


over
 the
 place
 especially
 with
 the


cognate
 now
 this
 is
 for
 maybe
 n
 native


English
 speakers
 but
 the
 cognate


possible
 if
 you
 say
 something
 as


possible
 people
 interpret
 this
 in


extraordinarily
 wide


ranges
 so
 the
 reason
 you
 want
 to
 avoid


words
 like
 that
 it's
 a
 serious


possibility
 we'll
 have
 a
 recession
 next


year
 whatever
 it
 is
 is
 because
 a
 you're


not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 keep
 track
 of


your
 forecast
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 weas
 a


out
 of
 it
 after
 the
 fact
 but
 B
 if
 you're


communicating
 with
 someone
 they
 may
 hear


something
 very
 different
 than
 what
 you


mean
 and
 that's
 crucial


now
 the
 last
 aspect
 of
 this
 is
 uh
 this


came
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 before
 but
 I
 think


it's
 fascinating
 in
 in
 Adam's
 com
 this


guy
 I
 love
 his
 name
 is
 Keith
 stanovich


he's
 a
 developmental
 psychologist
 uh


most
 recent
 Meritus
 at
 the
 University
 of


Toronto
 he's
 written
 a
 lot
 of
 books
 but


he
 wrote
 a
 book
 in
 2009
 called
 what


intelligence
 tests
 Miss
 it's
 not
 the


snappiest
 book
 title
 of
 all
 time
 but


it's
 veryy
 descriptive
 of
 the
 content


and
 what
 he
 argues
 is
 there's
 this
 thing


called
 IQ
 and
 you
 know
 more
 of
 it
 tends


to
 be
 better
 than
 less
 of
 it
 that's
 fine


and
 there's
 a
 thing
 he
 calls
 RQ


rationality
 quotient
 the
 ability
 to
 make


good
 decisions
 he
 says
 that's
 really


what's
 important
 and
 and
 they're
 kind
 of


on
 different
 sliders
 and
 we
 all
 know


this
 right
 you've
 all
 gone
 to
 school


people
 did
 really
 well
 in
 school
 and
 not


so
 well
 in
 life
 and
 we
 all
 know
 people


are
 not
 very
 good
 in
 school
 but
 very


good
 at
 life
 this
 is
 this
 RQ
 IQ
 so
 what


is
 RQ
 all
 about
 it
 turns
 out
 there
 are


two
 components
 to
 it
 one
 is
 called


instrumental
 rationality
 which
 is
 a


fancy
 way
 of
 saying
 you
 can
 achieve
 your


objectives
 given
 your
 constraints
 the


way
 we
 think
 about
 this
 in
 economics
 is


the
 axum's
 utility
 Theory
 the
 second


one's
 one
 I
 think
 we
 care
 about
 that
 is


this
 idea
 called
 epistemic
 rationality


it's
 a
 fancy
 word
 of
 saying
 how


accurately
 do
 your
 beliefs
 map
 to
 the


world
 and
 by
 the
 way
 you
 woke
 up
 this


morning
 with
 a
 certain
 set
 of
 beliefs
 of


how
 the
 world
 works
 you
 wandered
 around


this
 information
 confirmed
 it
 some


information
 may
 have
 disconfirmed
 it


what
 did
 you
 do
 in
 the
 face
 of
 that


evidence
 so
 here's
 a
 quote
 from
 Phil


techlock
 which
 I
 love
 and
 you
 heard
 this


earlier
 today
 in
 a
 different
 form


beliefs
 are
 hypotheses
 to
 be
 tested
 not


Treasures
 to
 be


protected
 the
 best
 investors
 take
 that


to
 heart
 beliefs
 are
 hypotheses
 to
 be


tested
 not
 Treasures
 to
 be
 protected


let's
 do
 this
 together
 ready
 late
 in
 the


day
 here's
 an
 example
 of
 how
 we
 might
 do


this
 right
 this
 is


um
 an
 example
 of
 how
 this
 works
 in


integrating
 information
 so
 imagine
 hope


I
 can
 read
 this
 imagine
 a
 zapper
 virus


causes
 a
 serious
 disease
 that
 occurs
 in


one
 in
 every
 thousand


people
 say
 there's
 a
 a
 um
 a
 test
 that


can
 detect
 perfectly
 if
 you
 have
 the


virus
 you're
 going
 to
 you're
 going
 to
 be


uh
 test
 positive
 additionally
 let's
 say


that
 the
 test
 actually
 has
 a
 5%
 false


positive
 so
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 it
 it's


going
 to
 say
 you
 have
 it
 one
 in
 every
 20


time
 5%
 false
 positive
 okay
 so
 now
 we


choose
 a
 person
 at
 random
 we
 know


nothing
 about
 his
 or
 her
 medical
 history


and
 that
 person
 tested
 tests
 positive


for
 the
 zapper


virus
 what
 is
 the
 probability
 from
 0
 to


100%
 that
 that
 person
 has
 the
 virus


us
 right
 so
 the
 test
 1,000
 test
 is


perfect
 5%
 fals
 positive
 we
 have
 someone


that
 has
 the
 virus
 what's
 the


probability
 anybody
 know
 this
 one
 but


notice
 you
 have
 like
 these
 numbers
 in


your
 head
 it's
 confusing
 but
 what
 you're


doing
 is
 integrating
 various
 pieces
 of


information
 and
 the
 answer
 is
 just
 a
 bit


under


2%
 and
 let
 me
 explain
 how
 to
 come
 up


with
 that
 very
 quickly
 in
 and
 in
 way


it's
 easy
 to
 reframe
 the
 problem
 let's


say
 there
 are
 a
 thousand
 people
 we're


going
 to
 test
 all
 of
 them
 first
 person


we're
 going
 to
 test
 the
 person
 that
 has


the
 virus
 they
 test
 positively
 put
 them


in
 the
 denominator
 we're
 then
 going
 to


test
 the
 other
 999
 5%
 of
 which
 will
 test


positive
 we
 put
 them
 in
 the
 denominator


so
 now
 our
 denominator
 is
 51
 we
 said
 we


picked
 one
 person
 at
 random
 they
 tested


positive
 one
 over
 51
 that's
 your
 2%


right
 when
 I
 say
 it
 that
 way
 it's
 easy


to
 follow
 no
 but
 you're
 integrating


different
 pieces
 of
 information
 and


that's
 what
 great
 investors
 were
 able
 to


do
 quite


effortlessly
 here's
 the
 last
 thing
 this


ties
 together
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 earlier


from
 Adam
 and
 also
 from
 what
 Annie
 just


talked
 about
 this
 is
 something
 called


Lynch
 pen
 analysis
 this
 comes
 from
 the


intelligence
 Community
 when
 you're


looking
 at
 investment
 idea
 what
 you
 want


to
 do
 is
 identify
 the
 key
 issues
 that


are
 really
 important
 for
 that
 for
 most


stocks
 or
 even
 asset
 classes
 two
 or


three
 things
 tend
 to
 be
 important


pinpoint
 the
 working
 assumptions
 behind


that
 so-called
 Lynch
 pin
 premises


um
 Advanced
 evidence
 for
 or
 against
 that


and
 this
 is
 where
 you
 can
 come
 up
 with


things
 like
 The
 Devil's
 Advocate
 and


then
 any
 indicators
 or
 signposts
 right


so
 the
 way
 you
 can
 do
 this
 to
 say
 we


have
 a
 variant
 perception
 here's
 what
 we


believe
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 and
 you
 write


it
 all
 down
 in
 advance
 the
 key
 to
 these


sign
 post
 is
 that
 kill
 criteria
 that
 Dan


was
 talking
 about
 so
 I
 know
 in
 advance


if
 I
 have
 a
 thesis
 that's
 different
 than


the
 market
 I
 should
 have
 these
 I
 should


pass
 these
 signposts
 on
 the
 road
 and
 if


I
 don't
 then
 I
 must
 change
 my
 mind
 about


what's
 going
 on
 and
 then
 last
 by
 the
 way


I
 did
 this
 with
 Chad
 I
 was
 very
 proud
 of


myself
 I
 did
 this
 with
 Chad
 GPT
 so
 this


is
 like
 my
 my
 generative
 AI
 thing
 but


this
 is
 just
 a
 Winding
 Road
 this
 is
 how


I
 really
 Envision
 it
 that
 you
 see
 these


signposts
 as
 you
 go
 along
 and
 if
 your


thesis
 is
 correct
 you
 should
 anticipate


seeing
 those
 signposts
 and
 if
 you
 don't


see
 the
 signpost
 you
 expect
 that
 is
 an


opportunity
 or
 in
 fact
 really
 a


challenge
 to
 change
 your


view
 so
 that
 let
 me
 stop
 what
 the
 best


investors
 do
 is
 calibrate
 well
 to
 start


they
 do
 that
 primarily
 by
 appealing
 to


base
 rates
 and
 second
 of
 course
 when
 new


information
 encourages
 you
 or
 forces
 you


to
 change
 your
 mind
 you
 should
 change


your
 mind
 when
 appropriate
 thank
 you


very
 much


thank
 you
 very
 much
 Michael
 that
 was


very
 interesting
 and
 we
 will
 all
 take


your


test
 I'm
 100%
 confident
 about
 it
 and


I've
 written
 it


down
 okay
 our
 next
 um
 next
 guest
 is
 a


real
 legend
 Mark
 andreon
 probably
 the


best
 Venture
 capit
 list
 the
 world
 has


ever
 seen


hi
 Mark
 good
 to
 see
 you
 again
 hello
 good


morning
 how's
 everybody
 we
 are
 really


well
 thank
 you
 now
 Mark
 where
 are
 we


going
 to
 make
 money
 going


forward
 well
 so
 in
 our
 business
 uh
 the


theory
 is
 relatively
 straight
 forward


which
 is
 uh
 we
 make
 money
 on


technological
 disruption
 um
 and
 so
 we
 we


make
 money
 when
 these
 new
 up
 start
 uh


startups
 uh
 form
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 either


either
 try
 to
 go
 take
 down
 a
 big


incumbent
 or
 try
 to
 create
 some
 kind
 of


New
 Market
 um
 and
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 do


um
 I
 I
 think
 for
 the
 World
 At
 Large
 uh


the
 you
 know
 the
 challenge
 is
 just
 that


there's
 a
 fundamental
 uh
 uh
 Supply


demand
 imbalance
 between
 the
 amount
 of


capital
 um
 you
 know
 that's
 seeking


productive
 uh
 economic
 investment


opportunities
 um
 and
 then
 the
 the
 number


of
 those
 opportunities
 and
 so
 I
 think


there's
 a
 a
 very
 large
 macro
 problem
 uh


on
 making
 money
 in
 the
 economy
 um
 and


and
 and
 and
 Tech
 and
 Venture
 Capital
 can


only
 be
 a
 small
 part
 of
 that
 answer
 but


but
 hopefully
 we
 will
 be
 a
 part
 of
 that


answer
 yeah
 well
 you
 are
 sitting
 in
 the


middle
 of
 Silicon
 Valley
 and
 you
 kind
 of


invented
 the
 internet
 so
 um
 kicking
 off


the
 the
 AI
 question
 just
 how
 how
 will


the
 AI
 raise
 pan
 out


here
 yeah
 so
 the
 the
 the
 theory
 and
 the


Hope
 um
 certainly
 that
 we're
 betting


that
 we're
 betting
 against
 and
 investing


hard
 against
 um
 is
 that
 is
 that
 Ai
 and


specifically
 these
 new
 breakthroughs


around
 AI
 like
 like
 generative
 AI
 uh


represent
 a
 new
 platform
 and
 in
 the
 in


the
 tech
 industry
 that's
 a
 sort
 of
 very


powerful
 concept
 uh
 because
 the
 idea
 of


a
 new
 platform
 in
 the
 tech
 industry
 is


sort
 of
 a
 new
 foundational
 technology
 um


that
 you
 can
 then
 imagine
 Reinventing


thousands
 and
 thousands
 of
 application


categories
 on
 top
 of
 and
 and
 the
 the
 the


tech
 industry
 historically
 um
 has
 been


fueled
 by
 these
 platforms
 you
 know
 the


original
 one
 was
 the
 Mainframe
 computer


that
 then
 led
 to
 mini
 computers
 client


server
 computers
 personal
 computers


mobile
 uh
 mobile
 computers
 um
 and
 every


time
 there's
 a
 platform
 shift
 There's
 an


opportunity
 to
 reinvent
 the
 industry
 and


reinvent
 basically
 the
 entire
 ecosystem


and
 and
 all
 the
 different
 ways
 that


people
 use
 technology
 and
 and
 create
 an


entirely
 new
 generation
 of
 companies
 um


and
 so
 we
 we
 certainly
 believe
 that
 AI


is
 is
 is
 a
 is
 a
 new
 platform
 shift
 we


believe
 that
 AI
 one
 of
 the
 really
 big


platform
 shifts
 we
 we
 think
 this
 you


know
 might
 the
 possibility
 exists
 that


this
 is
 on
 par
 with
 the


microprocessor
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 we


think
 there's
 an
 opportunity
 to
 take
 a


very
 broad
 uh
 perspective
 here
 and


invest
 in
 many
 different
 um
 both
 core


Technologies
 and
 also
 uh
 use
 cases
 of
 of


AI
 where
 is
 the
 where
 is
 the
 kind
 of


fight
 going
 on
 just
 now
 what
 uh
 is
 it


about
 chips
 or
 money
 or
 people
 or


electricity
 just
 what
 exactly
 is
 it
 yeah


so
 the
 the
 most
 dramatic
 thing
 about


this
 this
 sort
 of
 AI
 shift
 um
 is
 that


it's
 it's
 it's
 what
 I
 call
 an
 80-year


overnight
 success
 um
 and
 so
 the
 original


paper
 on
 neural
 networks
 which
 are
 the


foundational
 technology
 of
 AI
 was


actually
 written
 in
 1943
 um
 and
 then
 you


had
 over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 last
 80
 years


you
 had
 entire
 generations
 of


researchers
 who
 who
 basically
 try
 to


make
 AI
 work
 and
 for
 the
 most
 part


weren't
 weren't
 able
 to
 do
 it
 um
 in
 fact


when
 I
 when
 I
 was
 in
 school
 you
 know
 35


years
 ago
 a
 AI
 was
 a
 was
 a
 discredited


field
 because
 there
 had
 been
 an
 AI
 boom


in
 the
 80s
 that
 that
 that
 didn't
 pan
 out


um
 and
 so
 it's
 it's
 an
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


technology
 sector
 that's
 sort
 of
 been
 in


search
 of
 of
 working
 products
 for
 a
 long


time
 um
 essentially
 what
 happened
 was


the
 Breakthrough
 moment
 was
 in
 2022
 and


it
 was
 the
 it
 was
 the
 chat
 GPT
 moment
 um


and
 so
 it
 was
 you
 know
 it's
 actually
 7


79
 years
 into
 the
 technology
 but
 it
 was


a
 breakthrough
 moment
 and
 then
 it
 was
 a


breakthrough
 moment
 of
 it
 went
 basically


from
 not
 working
 to
 working
 incredibly


well
 in
 one
 step
 and
 you
 know
 the
 the


technolog
 is
 not
 perfect
 yet
 there's


still
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 to
 be
 done
 but
 it


fundamentally
 you
 know
 these
 products


are
 just
 incredible
 already
 in
 what
 they


can
 do
 and
 and
 they're
 far
 better
 out
 of


the
 gate
 than
 the
 than
 you
 know
 the


microprocessor
 was
 or
 than
 the
 internet


was
 um
 and
 so
 it's
 this
 kind
 of
 rare


situation
 where
 you
 have
 this
 dramatic


leap
 and
 functionality
 happening


extremely
 quickly
 um
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that


basically
 every
 part
 of
 the
 tech
 EOS


system
 is
 trying
 to
 react
 and
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 how
 to
 incorporate
 AI
 or


trying
 to
 build
 on
 AI
 or
 trying
 to
 you


know
 basically
 compensate
 you
 know


figure
 out
 how
 to
 how
 to
 compensate
 for


weaknesses
 in
 AI
 um
 every
 single
 sector


of
 the
 tech
 industry
 is
 reacting
 right


now
 um
 there
 is
 a
 you
 know
 massive
 chip


you
 know
 shortage
 this
 the
 biggest


Supply
 to
 balance
 Supply
 demand
 IM


balance
 and
 ships
 that
 we've
 ever
 seen


as
 an
 industry
 um
 and
 so
 there's
 a


massive
 fight
 happening
 there
 there's
 a


mass
 massive
 you
 know
 wave
 of
 data


center
 Innovation
 development
 there's


actually
 power
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 now


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 power
 and


cool
 these
 giant
 data
 centers
 there's


actually
 a
 Resurgence
 of
 interest
 and


nuclear
 power
 um
 around
 these
 data


centers
 um
 and
 then
 there's
 there
 are


there
 are
 basically
 fights
 happening
 up


and
 down
 the
 software
 stack
 you
 know
 the


the
 fight
 gets
 probably
 the
 most


publicity
 at
 the
 moment
 is
 the
 fight


between
 the
 software
 companies
 building


the
 so-called
 Foundation
 models
 um
 and


so
 and
 there
 there's
 sort
 of
 a
 big
 fight


between
 a
 view
 of
 the
 world
 in
 which


there
 will
 be
 a
 few
 big
 models
 that


basically
 win
 everything
 and
 then
 an


alternate
 view
 of
 the
 world
 which
 this


is
 more
 like
 the
 microprocessor
 and


there
 will
 actually
 be
 you
 know
 many
 you


know
 thousands
 of
 different
 models


running
 on
 billions
 of
 devices
 um
 you


know
 of
 many
 different
 shape
 sizes


descriptions
 customized
 in
 various
 ways


um
 and
 and
 actually
 that
 that
 latter


thesis
 is
 the
 thesis
 we're
 investing


against
 very


aggressively
 now
 you
 said
 last
 year
 that


we
 should
 just
 stuff
 AI
 into
 everything


we
 do
 like
 weapons
 cars
 everything
 in


order
 to
 beat
 the


Chinese
 what
 do
 you
 could
 you
 tell
 us


about
 it
 yeah
 there's
 there's
 sort
 of


two
 policy
 debate
 happening
 around
 AI
 um


you
 know
 somewhat
 somewhat
 for
 sure
 in


the
 EU
 but
 for
 sure
 in
 the
 US
 um
 and
 and


there's
 sort
 of
 one
 policy
 debate
 which


is
 you
 know
 AI
 is
 sort
 of
 weird
 and


scary
 and
 we
 should
 regulate
 it
 and
 we


should
 kind
 of
 prevent
 it
 from
 happening


in
 different
 ways
 and
 you
 know
 the
 EU


has
 put
 in
 place
 these
 kind
 of
 very


onerous
 regulations
 the
 UK
 has
 followed


and
 then
 there's
 a
 big
 fight
 happening


in
 US
 politics
 around
 this
 um
 and
 so


this
 is
 sort
 of
 an
 inward-looking
 you


know
 kind
 of
 domestic
 policy
 uh


Viewpoint
 and
 people
 have
 all
 all
 these


all
 these
 fears
 around
 AI
 um
 there's
 a


completely
 different
 conversation
 which


is
 the
 geopolitical
 conversation
 and


that's
 the
 that's
 the
 conversation
 of


basically
 you
 know
 geopolitical


competition
 with
 China
 um
 and
 of
 course


you
 know
 the
 minute
 you
 get
 into
 that


conversation
 it
 becomes
 very
 clear
 that


we
 need
 to
 win
 um
 and
 and
 specifically


the
 reason
 we
 need
 to
 win
 is
 we
 need
 to


win
 we
 need
 to
 win
 the
 AI
 race
 with


China
 you
 know
 sort
 of
 a
 very
 analogous


way
 that
 we
 won
 the
 you
 know
 the
 sort
 of


Technology
 race
 with
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 um


you
 know
 in
 in
 the
 previous
 Century


which
 is
 you
 know
 we
 have
 two
 basically


two
 basically
 dominant
 you
 know
 mindsets


regimes
 of
 you
 know
 Western
 democracy


and
 and
 and
 and
 Chinese
 communism
 um
 you


know
 that
 both
 have
 aspirations
 to
 to
 to


transform
 the
 world
 um
 you
 know
 both
 of


those
 are
 are
 supported
 by
 a
 major
 you


know
 major
 nation
 states
 both
 of
 those


are
 supported
 by
 Major
 militaries
 both


of
 those
 are
 supported
 by
 Major


economies
 and
 both
 of
 those
 are


supported
 by
 Major
 Tech
 Industries
 um


and
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 pre
 precedent
 of


the
 cold
 war
 with
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 the


reason
 the
 West
 won
 was
 because
 of
 sort


of
 a
 triangle
 of
 technological


superiority
 economic
 superiority
 and


then
 and
 then
 and
 then
 National
 Security


Military
 Intelligence
 superiority
 um
 but


you
 know
 we
 we
 decided
 we
 wanted
 to
 win


and
 and
 and
 we
 won
 right
 and
 by
 the
 way


our
 Victory
 ended
 up
 actually
 being


great
 for
 the
 the
 people
 of
 Russia
 right


it
 was
 actually
 really
 great
 for
 the


Soviet
 Union
 to
 fall
 and
 and
 you
 know


people
 people
 in
 Russia
 are
 much
 better


off
 today
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 I
 think


this
 is
 very
 straightforward
 like
 we
 we


need
 to
 win
 we
 need
 to
 win
 by
 being


better
 technologically
 better


economically
 and
 better
 militarily
 AI


has
 been
 identified
 as
 the
 core


technology
 uh
 for
 the
 future
 of
 the


nation
 state
 by
 both
 US
 military


planners
 by
 the
 Pentagon
 um
 as
 well
 as


by
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 Chinese


planners
 and
 so
 it
 will
 be
 one
 of
 the


main
 areas
 uh
 in
 which
 these
 you
 know


these
 kind
 of
 two
 the
 two
 hemispheres


compete
 and
 and
 and
 I
 think
 it's


important
 that
 we
 win
 where
 do
 you
 think


the
 West
 is
 now
 relative
 to


China
 so
 the
 West
 has
 I
 would
 say
 all
 of


the
 advantages
 and
 disadvantages
 of
 a


decentralized
 system
 uh
 and
 a
 market


economy
 and
 a
 and
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 system
 in


which
 governments
 don't
 control


everything
 um
 and
 you
 know
 the
 huge


advantage
 of
 that
 is
 innovation
 and


Entrepreneurship
 the
 disadvantage
 of


that
 is
 you
 know
 very
 it's
 very


difficult
 for
 our
 systems
 to
 plan
 you


know
 there
 you
 know
 there
 is
 no
 top-


down
 American
 Technology
 strategy
 there


is
 no
 top-
 down
 European
 technology


strategy
 those
 concepts
 are
 kind
 of
 you


know
 antithetical
 to
 our
 systems
 uh
 and


so
 we're
 very
 robust
 and
 dynamic
 in


general
 um
 but
 you
 know
 we're
 very
 messy


um
 the
 Chinese
 have
 both
 the
 advantages


and
 the
 disadvantages
 of
 a
 centralized


system
 much
 like
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 did
 um


you
 know
 they
 have
 a
 command
 and
 control


system
 where
 the
 Communist
 party
 you


know
 owns
 and
 controls
 everything
 and


they
 can
 direct
 their
 private
 companies


to
 do
 whatever
 they
 want
 which
 they're


doing
 right
 now
 you
 know
 with
 sort
 of


increasing
 Force
 um
 and
 then
 they
 have


all
 the
 disadvantages
 of
 of
 a


centralized
 system
 which
 is
 you
 know


they
 have
 they
 have
 a
 command
 system
 um


you
 know
 they're
 actually
 in
 the
 process


of
 trying
 to
 crush
 their
 entrepreneurial


system
 right
 now
 they're
 you
 know


they're
 trying
 to
 basically
 Drive
 their


entrepreneurs
 you
 know
 out
 of
 out
 of
 uh


you
 know
 in
 many
 cases
 out
 of
 business


in
 many
 cases
 out
 of
 the
 country
 um
 and


so
 it's
 it's
 it's
 like
 like
 the
 cold
 war


with
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 it's
 it's
 an


asymmetric
 situation
 each
 side
 brings


strengths
 and
 weaknesses
 and
 then
 I


would
 say
 you
 know
 each
 side
 is
 tempted


to
 embrace
 the
 model
 of
 the
 other
 side


to
 try
 to
 get
 the
 advantages
 so
 the


Chinese
 have
 kind
 of
 this
 fake


entrepreneurial
 system
 uh
 you
 know
 that


they
 kind
 kind
 of
 try
 to
 Foster
 and
 then


we
 have
 this
 sort
 of
 you
 know
 you
 know


sort
 of
 U
 not
 very
 effective
 you
 know


Central
 planning
 function
 um
 you
 know
 in


in
 in
 DC
 and
 in
 Brussels
 uh
 you
 know


that
 doesn't
 work
 very
 well
 and
 and
 at


least
 would
 argue
 we
 should
 lean
 into


the
 strengths
 of
 our
 system
 um
 and
 you


know
 and
 and
 try
 to
 benefit
 from
 the


fact
 that
 we
 should
 have
 a
 much
 more


Dynamic
 economy
 we
 should
 have
 much
 more


entrepreneurship
 um
 and
 and
 hopefully


that
 that's
 what
 we'll
 do
 talking
 of
 um


dynamism
 you
 when
 we
 met
 you
 also
 talked


about
 the
 importance
 of
 investing
 in


American
 dynamism
 and
 I
 guess
 that
 also


goes
 for
 European
 dynamism
 what
 what
 do


you
 mean
 by
 that
 yeah
 so
 you
 know
 look


the
 the
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 part
 of
 you
 know


this
 is
 part
 of
 the
 challenge
 for
 the


the
 geopolitical
 conflict
 as
 well
 as
 our


our
 domestic
 issues
 and
 so
 you
 know
 look


both
 both
 the
 US
 in
 EU
 I
 mean
 we're


we're
 we're
 you
 know
 we
 are
 the
 result


of
 the
 Industrial
 Revolution
 right
 we're


a
 result
 of
 the
 first
 Industrial


Revolution
 with
 things
 like
 steam
 power


we're
 the
 result
 of
 the
 Second


Industrial
 Revolution
 you
 know
 with


things
 like
 electricity
 where
 the
 result


of
 the
 of
 the
 computer
 age
 you
 know
 the


the
 the
 West
 represented
 by
 the
 US
 and


Europe
 is
 where
 you
 know
 most
 of
 these


Technologies
 over
 the
 last
 you
 know
 300


years
 were
 developed
 um
 and
 and


historically
 our
 society's
 benefited


enormously
 by
 this
 you
 know
 we
 we
 have


the
 highest
 standards
 of
 living
 you
 know


our
 our
 you
 know
 our
 children
 over
 time


have
 you
 know
 have
 done
 the
 best
 and
 and


and
 generally
 it's
 been
 a
 very
 you
 know


synergistic
 positive
 uh
 process
 um
 you


know
 in
 the
 last
 50
 years
 I
 think
 both


American
 society
 and
 EU
 Society
 has
 sort


of
 lost
 faith
 in
 the
 idea
 of


technological
 progress
 um
 and
 lost
 faith


frankly
 in
 the
 idea
 of
 economic
 progress


and
 you
 know
 decided
 to
 become
 let's
 say


I
 don't
 know
 much
 more
 you
 know
 cautious


much
 more
 risk
 averse
 um
 much
 more
 you


know
 sort
 of
 unwilling
 to
 to
 think
 of


change
 as
 a
 as
 a
 positive
 and
 exciting


thing
 um
 and
 and
 you
 know
 you
 actually


see
 that
 I
 would
 say
 in
 in
 in
 in
 in


America
 right
 now
 you
 know
 the


relationship
 between
 industry
 and
 the


government
 is
 is
 that
 a
 50
 year
 low
 it's


it's
 you
 know
 think
 the
 actually
 quite


quite
 a
 large
 amount
 of
 hostility


between
 government
 and
 Industry
 and
 the


same
 is
 certainly
 true
 in
 in
 in
 in


Europe
 um
 and
 and
 so
 again
 you
 know
 our


view
 is
 like
 look
 we
 you
 know
 we
 need


technology
 we
 need
 technology
 we
 need


Innovation
 we
 need
 markets
 we
 need
 these


things
 to
 function
 why
 because
 we
 need


growth
 um
 you
 know
 we
 we
 we
 want
 our


societies
 to
 be
 grow
 societies
 we
 want


people
 to
 think
 that
 there's
 opportunity


we
 want
 people
 to
 be
 able
 to
 think
 in


positive
 U
 uh
 some
 terms
 you
 know
 we
 we


don't
 want
 people
 to
 think
 in
 terms
 of


like
 for
 me
 to
 get
 something
 I
 have
 to


take
 it
 away
 from
 somebody
 else
 we
 want


to
 you
 know
 think
 about
 our
 society
 as


as
 societies
 that
 can
 grow
 and
 flourish


where
 our
 children
 will
 do
 better
 than


we
 do
 um
 and
 so
 American
 dynamism
 is


sort
 of
 a
 very
 direct
 investment
 program


that
 we
 have
 um
 you
 know
 focused
 on


injecting
 a
 lot
 more
 technological


energy
 into
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 sectors
 of
 the


economy
 that
 the
 governments
 are


involved
 in
 um
 and
 certainly
 defense
 and


intelligence
 are
 a
 big
 part
 of
 that
 but


also
 energy
 and
 and
 and
 law
 and


education
 and
 Healthcare
 are
 also
 big


parts
 and
 in
 all
 these
 sectors
 you
 know


frankly
 they
 they
 they
 just
 they
 I
 think


they're
 really
 suffering
 from
 a
 lack
 of


technological
 change
 and
 innovation
 and


they
 could
 really
 use
 it
 what
 would
 be


the
 key
 to
 get
 Europe
 to
 become
 more


Dynamic
 I
 mean
 not
 that
 we
 no
 dynamic
 in


Europe
 but


uh
 compared
 to
 Silicon
 Valley
 we
 seem
 to


be
 lagging
 a
 bit
 behind


here
 yeah
 so
 look
 if
 you
 you
 know
 if
 you


did
 a
 rank
 order
 of
 the
 the
 top
 50


technology
 companies
 30
 years
 ago
 a


large
 percentage
 of
 them
 were
 European
 I


think
 it
 was
 about
 40%
 um
 if
 you
 did
 a


rank
 order
 today
 I
 think
 it's
 one
 out
 of


50
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 Europe
 Europe
 has


really
 falling
 off
 and
 and
 I
 guess
 the


way
 I
 would
 describe
 it
 is
 it
 seems
 at


least
 from
 the
 outside
 it
 seems
 to
 be


almost
 entirely
 Choice
 uh
 which
 is
 it


seems
 like
 it's
 been
 a
 choice
 to
 sort
 of


prioritize
 regulation
 and
 risk
 aversion


and
 the
 precautionary
 principle
 over
 U


you
 know
 over
 Innovation
 you
 know
 the


most
 acute
 version
 of
 that
 obviously
 is


the
 energy
 sector
 um
 you
 know
 with
 a


sort
 of
 sort
 of
 voluntary
 standown
 of


energy
 development
 which
 you
 know
 I


think
 has
 has
 led
 to
 you
 know
 real


geopolitical
 stresses
 with
 respect
 to


Russia
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 I
 I
 look
 I


think
 I
 think
 it's
 been
 a
 choice
 I
 think


that
 I
 think
 the
 the
 political


leadership
 class
 in
 in
 in
 um
 in
 in


Europe
 has
 decided
 that
 they
 they
 want


this
 the
 the
 voters
 so
 far
 have


supported
 them
 in
 wanting
 it
 um
 you
 know


it
 has
 it
 has
 consequences
 I
 think
 the


consequences
 are
 becoming
 clearer
 I


think
 you
 know
 fundamentally
 it's
 a


choice
 at
 a
 societal
 level
 and
 you
 know


the
 the
 voters
 will
 either
 step
 up
 or


they
 won't
 and
 the
 leaders
 will
 either


step
 up
 or
 they
 won't
 but
 but
 but
 I


think
 the
 the
 results
 of
 the
 current


approach
 are
 in
 and
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


think
 they're
 they're
 very
 good
 any


reflection
 any
 Reflections
 on
 your


responsibility
 as
 a
 venture
 capitalist


or
 Venture
 Capital
 investor
 at
 a
 time


where
 technology
 is
 becoming
 so


integrated
 into
 the
 race
 between
 the


superpowers
 you
 know
 um
 ellon
 musk
 with


with
 starling
 ly
 being
 key
 in
 Ukraine
 uh


and
 so
 on
 what
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 think


about
 it
 yeah
 so
 I
 would
 describe
 it
 as


we're
 100%
 on
 the
 side
 of
 the
 United


States
 um
 and
 we're
 100%
 on
 the
 side
 of


the
 West
 um
 and
 so
 we
 know
 we
 never
 as
 a


firm
 for
 example
 had
 an
 investment


program
 in
 China
 we
 never
 we
 know
 we


always
 viewed
 that
 there
 would
 be


difficulties
 from
 that
 which
 you
 know


for
 a
 long
 time
 you
 know
 looked
 like
 a


mistake
 but
 I
 think
 is
 now
 you
 know


increasingly
 clear
 so
 so
 we're
 100%
 on


the
 side
 of
 the
 US
 and
 the
 West
 um
 as
 a


firm
 we
 don't
 have
 our
 own
 foreign


policy
 We
 have
 basically
 the
 foreign


policy
 of
 the
 US
 state
 department
 um
 and


so
 we're
 you
 know
 we're
 sort
 of
 in


complete
 lock
 step
 with
 our
 uh
 with
 our


government
 you
 know
 we
 all
 of
 our


programs
 that
 involve
 anything
 involving


National
 Security
 will
 will
 will
 be


based
 you
 know
 on
 on
 on
 the
 US


government's
 view
 of
 of
 friends
 and


allies
 you
 know
 I
 would
 say
 this
 you


know
 this
 was
 a
 controversial
 position


basically
 up
 until
 Russia's
 invasion
 of


Ukraine
 um
 and
 so
 up
 until
 Russia's


invasion
 of
 Ukraine
 basically
 there
 was


a
 prevailing
 ethos
 in
 Silicon
 Valley


that
 National
 Security
 is
 somehow
 bad
 or


undesirable
 or
 the
 tech
 companies
 should


not
 want
 to
 you
 know
 be
 involved
 in
 it


and
 there
 was
 this
 famous
 incident
 where


Google
 had
 this
 program
 with
 the
 US


Department
 of
 Defense
 that
 their
 you


know
 their
 employees
 basically
 rioted
 on


campus
 and
 forced
 them
 to
 cancel
 um
 at


the
 same
 time
 that
 Google
 actually
 had


you
 know
 an
 AI
 lab
 in
 Beijing
 that
 by


definition
 is
 you
 know
 anything
 in
 in
 in


in
 China
 sort
 of
 connected
 to
 their


Security
 State
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 there


was
 a
 fair
 amount
 of
 I
 would
 think


internal
 descension
 division
 in
 in


Silicon
 Valley
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 the


right
 role
 is
 you
 know
 between
 the


valley
 and
 the
 US
 government
 um


basically
 what
 what
 we've
 observed
 is


the
 the
 minute
 Russia
 invaded
 Ukraine
 it


was
 you
 know
 was
 obviously
 a
 catastrophe


for
 Ukraine
 and
 a
 terrible
 thing
 and
 I


wish
 it
 hadn't
 happened
 but
 it
 it
 caused


sort
 of
 an
 instant
 sort
 of
 re
 um
 I
 don't


know
 like
 a
 depolarization
 of
 this
 issue


uh
 certainly
 in
 the
 in
 the
 US
 and
 in
 the


valley
 where
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 people
 who


historically
 had
 been
 very
 averse
 to


Tech
 involvement
 in
 defense
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 became
 very
 in
 favor
 of
 it
 um
 and


you
 know
 the
 most
 Vivid
 example
 there


was
 this
 company
 andrel
 that
 was
 a
 very


politically
 controversial
 company
 you


know
 our
 our
 new
 defense
 contractor
 uh


you
 know
 building
 all
 these
 automated


defense
 systems
 um
 it
 was
 a
 very


controversial
 company
 in
 the
 valley


basically
 right
 up
 to
 the
 day
 russan


invad
 Ukraine
 and
 ever
 since
 everybody


loves
 it
 um
 you
 know
 which
 the
 founder


of
 that
 company
 points
 out
 you
 know


there's
 some
 you
 know
 some
 some
 some


irony
 to
 that
 because
 the
 company's


doing
 the
 same
 things
 um
 uh
 but
 I
 you


know
 I
 think
 the
 Russian
 invasion
 of


Ukraine
 really
 highlighted
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people
 including
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 on
 the


political
 left
 in
 the
 US
 that
 actually


National
 Security
 really
 matters
 and


there
 are
 actually
 bad
 people
 in
 the


world
 and
 there
 are
 you
 know
 going
 to
 be


invasions
 and
 there
 going
 to
 be
 bad


things
 that
 happen
 and
 the
 Western


democracies
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 respond


and
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 be


state-of-the-art
 being
 able
 to
 cope
 with


these
 situations
 and
 then
 of
 course
 the


you
 know
 the
 attack
 in
 Israel
 you
 know


is
 a
 is
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 second
 again
 a


another
 terrible
 thing
 but
 a
 second
 kind


of
 uh
 factor
 that
 has
 caused
 to
 say
 okay


we
 we
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 Western


democracies
 are
 actually
 armed
 up
 yeah


yeah
 Mark
 finishing
 off
 on
 a
 completely


different
 T
 here
 uh
 in
 one


minute
 how
 can
 we
 become
 better


investors
 because
 that's
 the
 theme
 of


the


conference
 yeah
 so
 I
 think
 the
 question


always
 I
 I
 think
 the
 question
 for
 sort


of
 large
 institutional
 investing
 the


question
 is
 you
 know
 deployment
 of
 large


amounts
 of
 capital
 there
 just
 are
 not


that
 many
 places
 in
 the
 world
 to
 get


growth
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 the


fundamental
 challenge
 every
 large
 scale


investor
 I
 talk
 to
 deals
 with
 is
 you


know
 most
 the
 capital
 that
 they
 invest


uh
 you
 know
 just
 kind
 of
 by
 definition


can't
 go
 into
 high
 growth
 sectors
 um


just
 because
 there
 aren't
 that
 many
 high


growth
 sectors
 they're
 actually
 you
 know


quite
 quite
 hard
 to
 find
 um
 and
 so
 there


are
 a
 basically
 a
 small
 number
 of
 places


in
 the
 world
 that
 have
 growth
 there
 are


a
 small
 number
 of
 people
 who
 are


starting
 the
 kinds
 of
 companies
 and


trying
 to
 build
 the
 kinds
 of
 industries


that
 are
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 to
 deliver


growth
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 hope
 you
 know


generally
 speaking
 you
 know
 Western


investors
 are
 quite
 supportive
 of
 this


and
 so
 you
 know
 vure
 capital
 is
 quite


well
 funded
 but
 um
 you
 know
 I
 think


focusing
 in
 on
 the
 specifically
 the


places
 and
 the
 people
 who
 are
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 generate
 growth
 and
 then


quite
 frankly
 the
 other
 thing
 is
 um
 you


know
 it's
 very
 helpful
 when
 these


investors
 also
 weigh
 in
 more
 broadly


than
 just
 with
 money
 uh
 and
 also
 weigh


in
 with
 their
 influence
 and
 you
 know


with
 their
 with
 their
 level
 of
 authority


and
 their
 level
 of
 of
 you
 know


persuasive
 capability
 and
 so
 forth
 in


their
 societies
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 growth


is
 something
 that
 we
 should
 be
 aspiring


for
 and
 that
 is
 is
 actually
 good
 not


just
 from
 an
 investment
 standpoint
 but


from
 a
 societal
 standpoint
 fantastic


well
 a
 big
 thanks
 for
 sharing
 your


thoughts
 with
 us
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 all
 the


best
 of
 luck
 going
 forward
 great
 thank


you
 very
 much
 it's
 great
 to
 be
 with
 you


guys


[Applause]


now
 before
 we
 um
 share
 next
 year's


program
 with
 you
 I
 just
 want
 to
 say
 a


big
 thank
 you
 for
 to
 everybody
 who's


made
 this
 conference
 possible
 we've
 had


a
 lot
 of
 people
 working
 behind
 the


scenes
 so
 if
 you
 wouldn't
 mind
 just


helping
 me
 giving
 them
 a
 bit
 of


[Music]


Applause
 and
 then
 next
 year
 conference


is
 going
 to
 be
 um
 something
 very


different
 from
 this
 year
 uh
 you
 may


remember
 that
 we
 had
 uh
 the
 CEO
 of


Ferrari
 on
 the
 podcast
 a
 little
 while


back
 now
 he
 was
 very
 keen
 to
 come
 to


Oslo
 uh
 to
 uh
 to
 cook
 he's
 very
 keen
 on


his
 reindeer
 now


um
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 want
 to
 join
 um
 uh


the
 COO
 Ferrari
 when
 he
 comes
 to
 O
 law


so
 we
 have
 um
 a
 preliminary
 lineup


here
 in
 addition
 to
 Ferrari
 we
 have
 the


CEO
 of
 uh
 Nova
 Nordisk
 which
 is
 now
 the


largest
 uh
 company
 in
 uh
 Europe
 we
 have


uh
 door
 Dash
 which
 is
 the
 biggest


delivery
 company
 outside
 of
 uh
 America


of
 outside
 China
 we
 have
 Odis
 um
 which
 I


think
 in
 a
 way
 is
 exemplifying
 the


importance
 of
 recurring
 revenue
 streams


is
 an
 elevator
 company
 you
 know
 if
 you


don't
 pay
 your
 maintenance
 there
 is
 just


going
 to
 be
 no


service
 uh
 we
 have
 Nestle
 in
 terms
 of


pricing
 power
 talking
 about
 the


importance
 and
 how
 you
 build
 Brands
 and


how
 you
 do
 that
 we
 have
 Adidas
 BJ
 gulen


um
 coming
 to
 talk
 about
 Brands
 and
 then


um
 lastly
 I
 mean
 we
 um
 elen
 musk
 has


also
 said
 that
 he's
 coming
 uh
 but
 this


is
 not
 a
 super
 final
 program
 yet
 but


we
 uh
 you
 know
 things
 can


happen
 um
 but
 I
 think
 this
 this
 looks


really
 good
 29th
 of
 April
 next
 year
 uh


put
 it
 into
 your
 diary
 and
 we
 will
 um


send
 out
 invitations
 in


January
 that
 was
 all
 for
 the
 streaming


part
 of
 things
 so
 everybody
 who's


followed
 up
 followed
 us
 uh
 on
 stream
 a


really
 big
 thank
 you
 see
 you
 again
 in


April
 next
 year
 and
 all
 the
 best


[Applause]
