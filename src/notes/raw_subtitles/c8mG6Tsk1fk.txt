[Music]


hi
 everybody
 and
 welcome
 to
 in
 good


company
 today
 we
 have
 a
 very
 special


guest
 joining
 us
 somebody
 who
 has


basically
 reshaped
 how
 we
 think
 about


success
 and
 achievement
 his
 book
 range


has
 challenged
 the
 conventional
 wisdom


and
 showing
 us
 why
 generalists
 often


thrive
 in
 a
 specialized
 World
 David


Epstein
 what
 a
 pleasure
 to
 have
 you
 here


the
 pleasure
 is
 mine
 thanks
 for
 having


me
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 start
 with
 a
 kind


of
 a
 stupid
 question
 giving
 that
 we
 are


going
 to
 talk
 about
 generalists
 and


specialists
 uh
 for
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 time
 here


so
 what
 is
 a
 generalist
 in
 your
 view


yeah
 that's
 a
 great
 question
 I
 mean


there's
 some
 semantic
 aspect
 to
 it
 right


like
 when
 I
 think
 about
 my
 own
 career
 I


was
 I
 used
 to
 be
 training
 to
 be
 a


scientist
 and
 then
 I
 got
 off
 that
 track


and
 became
 the
 science
 writer
 at
 Sports


Illustrated
 magazine
 and
 so
 when
 I
 did


that
 my
 my
 science
 colleagues
 suddenly


thought
 of
 me
 as
 a
 generalist
 whereas
 my


sports
 writing
 colleagues
 suddenly


thought
 of
 me
 as
 a
 specialist
 because
 I


had
 this
 science
 background
 but
 I
 think


broadly
 speaking
 it's
 someone
 that


at
 a
 at
 certain
 points
 or
 at
 a
 certain


point
 sacrifices
 increasing
 depth
 to
 to


broaden
 themselves
 and
 sort
 of
 connect


knowledge
 uh
 and
 and
 broaden
 their
 their


own
 toolbox
 as
 opposed
 to
 just
 kind
 of


going
 with
 what
 tends
 to
 be
 natural


momentum
 of
 of
 getting
 deeper
 and
 deeper


and
 more
 narrow
 as
 as
 you
 progress
 and


why
 is
 this
 a
 good
 thing
 what
 are
 the


advantages
 of
 being
 a
 jist
 yeah
 I
 think


the
 advantages
 particularly
 stand
 out


because
 the
 the
 world
 is
 getting
 more


specialized
 and
 I
 think
 that
 made
 kind


of
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 for
 good
 portion
 of


the
 20th
 century
 but
 in
 fact
 now
 what
 we


see
 is
 that
 people
 are
 largely
 working


in
 uh
 what
 the
 psychologist
 Robin


Hogarth
 called
 wicked
 learning


environments
 so
 to
 give
 just
 a
 quick


background
 of
 that
 Hogarth
 kind
 of


reconciled
 this
 conundrum
 in
 expertise


research
 where
 some
 people
 studying


expertise
 saw
 that
 people
 get
 better


with
 narrow
 experience
 and
 and
 others


saw
 that
 they
 not
 only
 don't
 get
 better


they
 they
 get
 more
 confident
 but
 not


better
 which
 can
 be
 a
 really
 bad
 kind
 of


scenario
 and
 what
 hogart
 said
 is
 well
 it


depends
 on
 the
 the
 type
 of
 environment


that
 someone
 is
 working
 in
 in
 a
 kind


learning
 environment
 which
 is
 next
 steps


and
 goals
 are
 clear
 uh
 rules
 don't


change
 patterns
 repeat
 feedback
 is
 quick


and
 accurate
 people
 get
 better
 reliably


with
 narrow
 experience
 on
 the
 other
 end


are
 what
 he
 called
 wicked
 learning


environments
 where
 next
 steps
 and
 goals


may
 not
 just
 be
 given
 to
 you
 or
 rules


may
 change
 or
 patterns
 don't
 just
 repeat


feedback
 could
 be
 delayed
 or
 inaccurate


a
 lots
 of
 human
 dynamics
 are
 involved


you
 basically
 work
 next
 year
 may
 not


look
 like
 work
 last
 year
 and
 in
 those


kinds
 of
 environments
 which
 we're


increasingly
 thrust
 into
 in
 our
 work


because
 the
 workplace
 changes
 more


rapidly
 than
 it
 ever
 has
 before
 it's


people
 that
 have
 this
 sort
 of
 broader


set
 of
 skills
 that
 allow
 them
 to
 Pivot


and
 to
 create
 kind
 of
 generalized


flexible
 skills
 and
 mental
 models
 who


are
 really
 able
 to
 to
 adapt
 over
 time


and
 that's
 the
 situation
 more
 and
 more


people
 um
 are
 in
 so
 why
 is
 the
 world


becoming
 more
 wicked
 I
 think
 it's
 well


so
 there
 was
 a
 period
 for
 much
 of
 the


20th
 century
 at
 least
 where
 we
 had
 a


model
 that
 actually
 worked
 quite
 well


where
 people
 could
 have
 kind
 of
 a


discreet
 per
 perod
 of
 training
 or


education
 and
 then
 a
 discreet
 period
 of


working
 based
 on
 that
 training
 or


education
 I
 mean
 I'm
 simplifying
 it
 but


but
 more
 or
 less
 and
 companies
 didn't
 go


in
 out
 of
 existence
 as
 quickly
 uh


technological
 innovation
 didn't
 um


change
 tend
 to
 change
 the
 workplace


quite
 as
 rapidly
 and
 so
 you
 can
 see


through
 the
 20th
 century
 like
 the
 number


of
 different
 jobs
 that
 people
 have


starts
 to
 increase
 in
 the
 latter
 half
 of


the
 20th
 century
 and
 even
 when
 people


are
 staying
 in
 the
 same
 jobs
 the
 stuff


they're
 actually
 doing
 is
 starting
 to


change
 at
 a
 much
 faster
 pace
 and
 they're


having
 to
 learn
 new
 tools
 and
 all
 these


things
 if
 they
 want
 to
 want
 to
 kind
 of


stay
 competent
 and
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 you


know
 part
 technological
 innovation
 it's


part
 globalization
 but
 it's
 just
 that


for
 most
 people
 that
 model
 of
 period
 of


training
 followed
 by
 period
 of
 working


has
 been
 replaced
 with
 relearning
 and


retraining
 and
 having
 to
 sort
 of


reinvent
 over
 and
 over
 and
 over
 now
 in


your
 book
 you
 talk
 about
 some
 things
 um


that
 uh
 you
 need
 to
 do
 to
 get
 there
 you


need
 to
 embrace
 diverse
 experience
 es


focus
 on
 learning
 be
 adaptable
 um
 seek


out
 interdisciplinary
 collaboration
 and


so
 on
 what
 are
 the
 most
 important
 things


you
 need
 to
 do
 in
 order
 to
 become
 a


really
 strong
 jist
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I


think
 is
 really
 important


is
 what
 what
 scientists
 tend
 to
 call
 the


sampling
 period
 where
 and
 I
 and
 I
 don't


want
 this
 to
 sound
 like
 you
 only
 need
 to


have
 this
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 your


career
 but
 the
 sampling
 period
 is
 this


idea
 that
 we
 we
 don't
 know
 as
 much
 as
 we


could
 about
 ourselves
 our
 own
 interests


our
 own
 abilities
 our
 opportunities


until
 we've
 actually
 tried
 some
 things


and
 so
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 successful


people
 tend
 to
 go
 through
 this
 sampling


period
 where
 they
 try
 some
 things
 they


dive
 into
 it
 they
 get
 sort
 of
 feedback


and
 Signal
 about
 what
 their
 interests


and
 abilities
 are
 and
 then
 they
 pivot
 uh


based
 on
 that
 knowledge
 as
 opposed
 to


just
 kind
 of
 staying
 heads
 down
 uh
 and


staying
 on
 a
 path
 just
 because
 they


started
 on
 it
 so
 for
 example
 in
 the
 book


I
 write
 about
 this
 project
 at
 Harvard


called
 the
 Darkhorse
 project
 that
 was


studying
 people
 I
 mean
 many
 of
 them
 were


like
 very
 successful
 in
 all
 sorts
 of


tradition
 metrics
 you
 know
 they
 had
 made


a
 lot
 of
 money
 and
 things
 but
 the


dependent
 variable
 was
 really
 their


sense
 of
 fulfillment
 actually
 the
 reason


it's
 called
 the
 Darkhorse
 project


actually
 is
 because
 when
 they
 brought
 in


these
 subjects
 just
 for
 sort
 of
 to


orient
 them
 to
 the
 study
 that
 people


would
 say
 well
 you
 know
 don't
 tell


people
 to
 do
 what
 I
 did
 because
 you
 know


I
 came
 through
 this
 I
 started
 on
 this


one
 thing
 and
 then
 I
 pivoted
 and
 and
 so


I
 was
 and
 Dark
 Horse
 means
 like
 someone


who
 came
 out
 of
 expression
 that
 means


someone
 who
 came
 out
 of
 nowhere
 and
 that


turned
 out
 to
 be
 the
 norm
 it
 wasn't


everyone
 but
 it
 was
 the
 very
 large


majority
 had
 sort
 of
 followed
 this
 path


where
 they
 started
 down
 one
 route
 and


said
 okay
 you
 know
 this
 actually
 doesn't


quite
 fit
 me
 the
 way
 I
 thought
 but
 I'm


going
 to
 take
 what
 I
 learned
 and
 hear
 my


kind
 of
 interest
 and
 opportunities
 right


now
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 this
 one
 for
 and


maybe
 a
 year
 from
 now
 I'll
 change


because
 I
 will
 have
 learned
 something


about
 myself
 and
 they
 keep
 doing
 this


pivoting
 until
 they
 get
 to
 better
 what
 a


conom
 is
 called
 match
 quality
 which
 is
 a


degree
 of
 fit
 between
 one's
 interests


abilities
 and
 the
 work
 that
 one
 does
 and


so
 not
 only
 are
 they
 kind
 of


triangulating
 a
 better
 fit
 in
 their
 work


which
 turns
 out
 to
 be
 really
 important


for
 your
 sense
 of
 fulfillment
 and
 for


your
 performance
 but
 they
 get
 there
 with


this
 broad
 kind
 of
 array
 of
 background


experiences
 that
 they
 bring
 with
 them
 in


this
 broad
 toolbox
 and
 so
 I
 think
 having


that
 habit
 of
 Mind
 where
 you're
 always


kind
 of
 what
 did
 I
 learn
 from
 this
 what


can
 I
 take
 to
 the
 next
 experience
 and


continually
 triangulating
 better
 match


quality
 through
 the
 course
 of
 your


career
 um
 is
 a
 really
 important
 kind
 of


habit
 of
 mind
 for
 someone
 who
 wants
 to


be
 a
 so-called
 good
 generalist
 now
 you


um
 also
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 on
 on
 Sports
 um


what
 are
 some
 of
 the
 examples
 where


people
 have
 tried
 different
 type
 of


Sports
 and
 ended
 up
 in
 a
 better
 place


yeah
 you
 know
 let
 me
 tell
 you
 one
 that
 I


that
 really
 surprised
 me
 because
 at
 one


point
 when
 I
 was
 doing
 some
 of
 this
 I


used
 to
 be
 the
 science
 writer
 at
 Sports


Illustrated
 and
 when
 I
 was
 talking
 about


some
 of
 this
 just
 giving
 a
 short
 you


know
 15-minute
 talk
 about
 some
 of
 the


sports
 data
 in
 an
 A
 Crowd
 that
 included


Serena
 Williams
 in
 the
 audience
 and
 she


sits
 in
 the
 second
 row
 and
 I'm
 kind
 of


freaking
 out
 because
 you
 know
 I'm
 going


to
 talk
 about
 the
 benefits
 of
 diversity


and
 as
 far
 as
 I
 know
 she's
 like
 the


opposite
 story
 of
 that
 and
 you
 can


Marshal
 all
 the
 scientific
 data
 you
 want


right
 but
 if
 if
 if
 the
 goat
 stands
 up


and
 says
 you're
 an
 idiot
 it's
 going
 to


be
 a
 bad
 day
 for
 you
 I
 think
 so
 it


perhaps
 would
 have
 been
 worse
 if
 you
 had


to
 play
 against
 her
 in
 tennis
 but
 yeah


that's
 the
 that
 you
 know
 what
 but
 I
 I
 I


I
 would
 have
 rather
 been
 a
 that
 would


have
 been
 acceptable
 embarrassment
 on


the
 tennis
 court
 whereas
 this
 was
 like
 I


was
 the
 one
 on
 stage
 so
 this
 would
 have


been
 worse
 embarrassment
 for
 me
 um
 but


she
 stands
 up
 afterward
 and
 says
 like
 to


raise
 her
 hand
 for
 the
 first
 question


I'm
 like
 oh
 man
 man
 and
 she
 says
 I
 think


my
 father
 was
 ahead
 of
 his
 time
 he
 had


me
 do
 track
 and
 field
 Taekwondo


gymnastics
 ballet
 learn
 to
 throw
 uh
 a


football
 for
 the
 overhand
 motion
 for
 a


serve
 um
 and
 and
 took
 me
 and
 my
 sister


off
 the
 traveling
 tour
 when
 he
 thought


it
 was
 getting
 too
 intense
 so
 we
 could


also
 focus
 on
 school
 and
 family
 um
 and
 I


was
 a
 senior
 writer
 at
 Sports


Illustrated
 and
 I
 had
 never
 heard
 that


story
 right
 even
 though
 that
 is
 what
 a


now
 mountain
 of
 scientific
 research


suggests
 that
 this
 diversity
 early


actually
 sets
 people
 up
 to
 have
 these


generalized
 skills
 what
 some
 people
 call


physical
 literacy
 these
 generalized


skills
 that
 then
 scaffold
 later


technical
 knowledge
 where
 the
 the


opposite
 path
 the
 one
 that
 I
 thought
 you


know
 that
 Serena
 didn't
 do
 I
 didn't
 know


that
 she
 had
 done
 all
 these
 other
 things


there's
 actually
 a
 fundamental
 trade-off


this
 gets
 at
 what
 I
 think
 is
 kind
 of
 the


underlying
 theme
 on
 every
 page
 of
 range


there
 is
 this
 trade-off
 between


optimizing
 for
 short-term
 performance


and
 long-term
 development
 and
 so
 there


are
 now
 these
 just
 tremendous
 number
 of


studies
 in
 sports
 that
 show
 that
 the
 way


you
 make
 the
 best
 10-year-old
 performer


is
 not
 the
 same
 way
 as
 you
 make
 the
 best


20-year-old
 performance
 there's
 actually


an
 inverse
 relationship
 when
 when
 like


National
 development
 pipelines
 are


studied
 um
 between
 between
 Maxim


optimizing
 Junior
 performance
 and


optimizing
 senior
 performance
 if
 you


want
 to
 optimize
 senior
 performance
 you


want
 this
 kind
 of
 sampling
 period
 where


people
 do
 a
 variety
 of
 things
 it
 causes


them
 to
 build
 these
 generalized
 models


and
 generalized
 skills
 skills
 that
 are


then
 flexible
 and
 they
 they
 then
 more


rapidly
 uh
 learn
 new
 skills
 going


forward
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 people
 who


grow
 up
 with
 multiple
 languages
 they


actually
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 delay


but
 that
 delay
 doesn't
 last
 and
 they


then
 are
 advantaged
 for
 um
 learning
 any


subsequent
 languages
 it's
 actually
 like


the
 same
 exact
 mechanism
 really
 it's


interesting
 in
 um
 in
 Scandinavia
 there


is
 a
 great
 belief
 in
 U
 play
 in
 sport


early
 on
 and
 you
 know
 avoid
 or
 delay
 uh


serious
 competitive
 pressure
 yeah
 well
 I


me
 I
 would
 say
 to
 me
 without
 a
 doubt
 the


the
 best
 sports
 country
 in
 the
 world
 I


think
 right
 now
 is
 is
 Norway
 um
 I
 mean


more
 medals
 than
 the
 United
 States
 and


China
 combined
 I
 think
 in
 the
 last
 two


Winter
 Olympics
 I
 think
 in
 one
 of
 those


Winter
 Olympics
 might
 have
 even
 outdone


the
 US
 China
 and
 Germany
 combined


winning
 things
 in
 summer
 games
 that
 we


don't
 usually
 associate
 with
 Scandinavia


you
 know
 all
 you
 you
 may
 exaggerate
 a


Tony
 bit
 but
 uh
 I
 think
 uh
 the
 general


Gest
 of
 it
 is
 uh
 is
 is
 correct
 but
 David


how
 does
 this
 um
 stack
 up
 against
 uh
 the


10,000
 hour
 rule
 and
 and
 the
 concept
 of


deliberate
 practice
 which
 some
 people
 is


advocating
 my
 first
 book
 which


criticized
 some
 of
 the
 research


underlying
 the
 10,000
 hour
 rule
 because


the
 the
 original
 research
 came
 out
 of
 a


study
 that
 was
 done
 on
 30
 violin


students
 at
 a
 world-class
 Music
 Academy


um
 the
 top
 10
 of
 whom
 uh
 had
 been
 found


to
 have
 practiced
 spent
 10,000
 hours
 by


the
 age
 of
 20
 on
 average
 in
 deliberate


practice
 which
 is
 this
 effortful


cognitively
 engaged
 focused
 on


correcting
 errors
 practice
 you
 know
 not


playing
 around
 not


experimenting
 um
 and
 there
 were
 a
 lot
 of


flaws
 in
 that
 study
 one
 of
 which
 is
 that


that
 nobody
 actually
 did
 10,000
 hours


there
 was
 like
 some
 who
 did
 way
 less
 and


some
 who
 did
 way
 more
 in
 that
 tiny
 group


um
 and
 uh
 it
 it
 averaged
 a
 10,000
 hours


but
 I
 think
 the
 issue
 with
 the
 10,000


hours
 rule
 which
 and
 I
 can
 tell
 you


about
 after
 I
 criticized
 it
 Malcolm


Gladwell
 and
 I
 became
 running
 buddies
 so


we
 have
 these
 arguments
 on
 our
 on
 our


own
 time
 but
 we've
 come
 to
 pretty
 much


the
 same
 ground
 the
 idea
 was
 that
 this


is
 the
 only
 thing
 that
 matters
 your


accumulated
 deliberate
 practice
 and
 so


you
 should
 start
 as
 early
 as
 possible
 in


as
 narrowly
 technical
 practice
 as
 you


possibly
 can
 and
 except
 for
 certain
 very


uh
 simple


activities
 uh
 there's
 a
 mountain
 of


evidence
 that
 suggests
 this
 this
 just


isn't
 right
 like
 there's
 there's
 almost


nothing
 that
 actually
 works
 in
 favor
 of


it
 you
 really
 want
 again
 if
 you're


trying
 to
 optimize
 for
 the
 short
 term


sometimes
 that
 might
 make
 sense
 but
 if


you
 want
 to
 build
 both
 physical
 and


cognitive
 models
 that
 can
 be
 flexible


for
 future
 problem
 solving
 a
 a
 better


rule
 to
 think
 of
 than
 the
 10,000
 hours


rule
 which
 is
 very


splashy
 uh
 is
 this
 classic
 finding
 that


comes
 out
 of
 cognitive
 psych
 psychology


that
 can
 be
 summarized
 as
 breadth
 of


training
 predicts
 breadth
 of
 transfer
 so


transfer
 is
 a
 term
 psychologists
 use
 to


mean
 taking
 your
 skills
 and
 applying


them
 to
 a
 problem
 that's
 not
 exactly
 the


same
 as
 the
 last
 one
 like
 your
 ability


to
 to
 adapt
 to
 New
 Challenges
 and
 new


tasks
 and
 what
 predicts
 your
 ability
 to


do
 that
 which
 is
 what
 we
 in
 modern
 work


rely
 on
 every
 day
 what
 predicts
 your


ability
 to
 do
 that
 is
 the
 is
 the
 breadth


of
 problems
 youve
 faced
 in
 training
 so


when
 you
 face
 a
 really
 broad
 uh
 sampling


of
 problems
 in
 training
 or
 lots
 of


different
 activities
 it
 forces
 you
 to


build
 these
 generalized
 models
 that
 you


can
 then
 kind
 of
 slot
 in
 to
 whatever
 the


new
 challenge
 is
 as
 opposed
 to
 just


being
 the
 opposite
 where
 the
 10,000


hours
 approach
 off
 leads
 to
 what


psychologists
 call
 the
 einstellung


effect
 which
 is
 where
 you've
 solved
 a


problem
 a
 certain
 way
 so
 many
 times


you'll
 continue
 doing
 that
 even
 if
 it's


no
 longer
 the
 solution
 so
 when
 is
 it


good
 to
 be
 a
 specialist
 I
 mean
 clearly


you
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 a
 a
 generalist


brain
 surgeon
 operating
 on
 you
 would
 you


no
 absolutely
 not
 I
 mean
 so
 so
 okay
 so
 I


I
 gave
 a
 talk
 a
 little
 while
 ago
 to
 a


group
 of
 Surgeons
 that
 were
 like
 so


specialized
 and
 you
 know
 I
 wanted
 to
 be


a
 little
 provocative
 um
 but
 also
 I'd


written
 quite
 a
 bit
 about
 uh
 uh
 poor


medical
 practices
 when
 I
 was
 in


investigative
 reporter
 and
 so
 I
 brought


up
 some
 of
 the
 data
 that
 showed
 that


specialized
 surgeons
 have
 fewer


complications
 in
 their
 procedures
 not


only
 even
 if
 you
 control
 for
 the
 number


of
 times
 that
 a
 surgeon
 has
 done
 a


procedure
 still
 the
 surgeons
 who


identify
 as
 more
 specialized
 still
 have


fewer
 comp
 complications
 so
 there's


something
 above
 and
 beyond
 even
 just
 the


number
 of
 repetitions
 they've
 had
 about


being
 specialized
 but
 the
 data
 also
 show


that
 they
 are
 much
 more
 likely
 to
 do


those
 procedures
 when
 they're


unwarranted
 and
 to
 continue
 to
 do
 them


even
 if
 data
 has
 shown
 unequivocally


that
 they
 they
 aren't
 right
 that
 they


don't
 actually
 work
 or
 they
 can
 even
 be


harmful
 so
 it's
 sort
 of
 this
 this


double-edged
 sword
 it's
 not
 that
 we


don't
 need
 those
 people
 who
 have
 such


great
 motor
 memory
 that
 they've
 like


automated
 the
 important
 parts
 of
 the


task
 in
 their
 brain
 essentially
 but
 it's


but
 it's
 really
 a
 double-edged
 sword
 so


I
 think
 the
 challeng
 is
 in
 places
 where


you
 have
 you
 know
 areas
 where
 you
 just


need
 skills
 that
 are
 so
 thoroughly


automated
 in
 the
 brain
 that
 someone


really
 you
 know
 has
 perfected
 them
 a


pilot
 a
 surgeon
 how
 do
 we
 balance
 that


need


uh
 with
 the
 Ein
 effect
 basically
 where


the
 the
 inability
 to
 see
 that
 this
 isn't


the
 right
 solution
 anymore
 now
 um
 let's


move
 on
 to
 the
 educational
 system
 and
 um


how
 that
 promotes
 or
 hinders
 generalism


so
 um
 wait
 by
 the
 way
 can
 I
 make
 one
 one


more
 just
 funny
 point
 about
 those


surgeons
 I
 talked
 to
 when
 I
 talked
 to


them
 and
 I
 was
 expecting
 them
 to
 lambas


me
 right
 and
 they
 they
 loved
 it
 but
 they


all
 said
 like
 we
 know
 this
 is
 a
 problem


that
 we're
 overdoing
 these
 procedures


and
 it's
 my
 colleagues
 really
 need
 to


get
 it
 together
 so
 it's
 interesting
 to


hear
 them
 explain
 they
 all
 felt
 this
 was


a
 problem
 and
 they
 all
 felt
 it
 wasn't


them
 uh
 so
 it's
 an
 interesting
 kind
 of


conundrum
 a
 tricky
 problem
 to
 solve
 yeah


yeah
 of
 course
 it's
 never
 my
 problem
 um


talk
 about


education
 education
 I
 mean
 obviously
 a


broad
 uh
 a
 broad
 remit
 but
 I
 think
 again


is
 is
 um
 there's
 an
 analogy
 to
 the


research
 we
 see
 in
 sports
 here
 again
 so


again
 to
 give
 a
 concrete
 example
 just


because
 I
 think
 it's
 easier
 to
 to
 think


about
 concrete
 examples
 take
 a
 study


that
 was
 done
 again
 um
 you
 know
 more
 in


in
 tune
 with
 the
 literature
 in
 the


United
 States
 so
 this
 was
 done
 in
 the


United
 States
 in
 California
 where
 uh


Middle
 School
 um
 you
 know
 this
 would
 be


like
 very
 early
 teenagers
 basically
 um


uh
 classrooms
 were
 randomized
 to


different
 types
 of
 math
 instruction
 some


of
 them
 got
 what's
 called
 blocked


practice
 which
 is
 like
 if
 you
 took


problem
 type
 A
 A
 A
 AA
 practice
 practice


practice
 then
 bbbbb
 practice
 practice


practice
 others
 were
 and
 and
 the


students
 they
 make
 progress
 fast
 they


like
 it
 feels
 good
 great
 rate
 their


teacher
 great
 everything
 the
 other


groups
 were
 randomized
 to
 what's
 called


interleaved
 practice
 where
 instead
 of


getting
 a
 AAA
 bbbbb
 it's
 as
 if
 you
 took


all
 the
 problem
 types
 threw
 them
 in
 a


hat
 and
 Drew
 them
 out
 at
 random
 so
 now


the
 students
 get
 more
 frustrated
 their


progress
 initial
 progress
 is
 slower


sometimes
 they
 re
 rate
 the
 teacher
 uh


more


poorly
 um
 but
 instead
 of
 learning
 how
 to


execute
 procedures
 they're
 learning
 how


to
 match
 a
 strategy
 to
 a
 type
 of
 problem


and
 the
 problem
 is
 is
 if
 if
 if
 you're


struggling
 that's
 not
 a
 sign
 that
 you're


not
 learning
 if
 you're
 not
 struggling


that's
 definitely
 a
 sign
 that
 you're
 not


learning
 and
 then
 when
 the
 test
 comes


around
 those
 inter
 leave
 the
 students


who
 got
 inter
 leave
 practice
 blew
 the


block
 Practice
 Group
 away
 it
 was
 like
 on


the
 order
 of
 moving
 the
 50th
 percentile


kid
 to
 the
 80th
 percentile
 because
 in


the
 test
 everyone
 has
 to
 face
 new


problems
 so
 now
 they
 have
 to
 do
 that


transfer
 where
 they
 take
 some
 of
 those


skills
 and
 apply
 it
 to
 a
 new
 problem
 and


they
 were
 much
 better
 equipped
 to
 do


that
 because
 again
 that
 mixed
 practice


practice
 forces
 you
 to
 kind
 of
 build


these
 generalized
 models
 so
 in
 the
 in


the
 David
 Epstein
 super
 School
 you
 just


mix
 and
 match
 throughout
 the
 whole
 day


all
 types
 of
 things
 yeah
 definitely
 I


would
 definitely
 broaden
 it
 but
 I
 think


I
 would
 also
 have
 a
 curriculum
 that
 was


more
 or
 sort
 of
 more
 interdisciplinarily


cohesive
 because
 we
 already
 have
 we


already


have
 curricula
 that
 are


interdisciplinary
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 a


kid
 goes
 to
 different
 subjects
 all
 day


but
 there's
 no
 cohesion
 between
 them
 and


so
 I
 think
 like
 some
 ways
 to
 um
 you
 know


we
 focus
 on
 certain
 things
 like
 uh
 we


like
 it
 when
 kids
 learn
 how
 to
 read


really
 early
 and
 obviously
 it's


important
 for
 kids
 to
 to
 learn
 how
 to


read
 but
 there's
 no
 there's
 no
 evidence


that
 learning
 something
 that
 everyone
 is


going
 to
 learn
 a
 little
 bit
 early
 really


makes
 a
 difference
 so
 so
 we
 often
 a
 lot


of
 our
 intervention
 programs
 focus
 on


what's
 called
 closed
 skills
 which
 are


things
 that
 everyone's
 going
 to
 learn


it's
 like
 teaching
 a
 kid
 how
 to
 walk


earlier
 than
 others
 like
 it
 might
 seem


impressive
 but
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 in
 the


long
 run
 so
 I
 think
 I
 would
 I
 would
 make


uh
 to
 make
 this
 interdisciplinarity
 more


cohesive
 I
 might
 organize
 a
 curriculum


around
 like
 the
 progression
 of
 human


ideas
 because
 I've
 found
 in
 my
 just
 my


own
 learning
 you
 know
 in
 in
 any
 given


era
 art
 and
 chemistry
 and
 biology
 and


technology
 and
 economics
 and
 all
 these


things
 are
 interlaced
 in
 a
 given
 era
 and


I
 think
 I
 would
 try
 to
 have
 maybe
 and


and
 and
 the
 way
 that
 those
 ideas


progress
 off
 one
 another
 I
 think
 is
 is


very
 useful
 for
 kind
 of
 getting
 a


grounding
 in
 in
 human
 progress
 and
 and


human
 thought
 and
 so
 I
 might
 Orient
 the


curriculum
 around
 around
 that
 about


whatever
 the
 discipline
 is
 in
 teaching


people
 that
 kind
 of
 progression
 of
 human


ideas
 and
 how
 we
 got
 to
 where
 we
 are


today
 and
 that
 might
 have
 sort
 of
 some


linkage
 between
 the
 disciplin
 so
 it's


not
 just
 like
 oh
 I'm
 done
 with
 math


class
 now
 I
 go
 to
 history
 class
 which
 is


a
 totally
 different
 thing
 in
 history
 and


math
 have
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 one
 another


because
 obviously
 that's
 right


disciplines
 are
 a
 necessary
 evil
 for


making
 the
 world
 comprehensible
 in


giving
 people
 career
 trajectories


someone
 has
 to
 put
 the
 world
 back


together
 again
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 to


solve
 problems
 well
 the
 data
 seems
 to


support
 that
 um
 boys
 are
 scholastically


properly
 ready
 for
 school
 later
 than


than
 girls
 um
 should
 we
 should
 boys


start
 later
 in
 school
 gosh
 that's
 a


tough
 one
 because
 you
 know
 it's
 not
 just


boys
 I
 mean
 boy
 that's
 true
 um
 but


there's
 also
 the
 whole
 relative
 age


effect
 in
 general
 which
 is
 the
 that
 kids


who
 are
 and
 this
 shows
 up
 in
 in
 sports


also
 actually
 I
 think
 was
 discovered


first
 in
 in
 sports
 where
 kids
 that
 are


born
 later
 in
 their
 age
 cohort
 in
 their


school
 cohort
 um
 I
 think
 that
 may
 have


been
 your
 friend
 Gladwell
 he
 he's


written
 about
 that
 yeah
 he's
 written


about
 that
 in
 the
 in
 the
 sports
 area


where
 in
 yeah
 and
 but
 like
 in
 Germany


for
 example
 they
 did
 some
 research
 where


they
 saw
 that
 kids
 and
 especially
 boys


um
 who
 were
 born
 later
 in
 the
 age
 cohort


so
 they're
 effectively
 9
 10
 11
 12
 months


younger
 than
 kids
 that
 they're
 in
 school


with
 were
 far
 more
 likely
 to
 get


diagnosed
 with
 behavior
 issues
 or
 ADHD


and
 medicated
 and
 things
 like
 that
 or
 to


get
 you
 know
 put
 down
 a
 level
 if
 they're


classes
 tracked
 and
 the
 problem
 was
 just


as
 Sports
 coaches
 mistake
 early


maturation
 kids
 for
 potential
 just


because
 they're
 bigger
 because
 they're


10
 months
 older
 or
 whatever
 in
 school


you
 know
 when
 kids
 are
 seven
 eight
 or


nine
 or
 10
 being
 10
 months
 younger
 is


actually
 a
 big
 deal
 and
 it
 shows
 up
 in


their
 behavior
 and
 so
 we
 mistake
 this


sort
 of
 talent
 or
 potential
 or
 whatever


for
 just
 biological
 maturation
 I
 do


think
 we
 should
 try
 to
 do
 something


about
 that
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 we
 would


fully
 correct
 that
 like
 kind
 of
 one
 I


think
 and
 I
 think
 there's
 some
 countries


um
 particularly
 like
 Finland
 does
 a


great
 job
 of
 making
 sure
 that
 when
 kids


are
 young
 they
 don't
 get
 tracked
 down
 so


there
 may
 be
 a
 kid
 who's
 relatively


younger
 but
 they
 put
 a
 ton
 of
 emphasis


they
 don't
 they
 don't
 put
 as
 much


emphasis
 I
 think
 as
 maybe
 the
 research


would
 suggest
 on
 tracking
 people
 up
 when


they're
 ready
 for
 it
 but
 they
 put
 a
 lot


of
 emphasis
 on
 not
 letting
 people
 get


tracked
 down
 which
 then
 puts
 them
 on


this
 trajectory
 where
 they're
 kind
 of


stuck
 forever
 and
 so
 I
 think
 some
 of


that
 emphasis
 more
 oriented
 toward
 not


letting
 those
 kids
 and
 who
 are
 often


boys
 get
 tracked
 down
 until
 they
 can


kind
 of
 catch
 up
 maturationally
 would
 be


would
 be
 really
 important
 but
 also
 we


know
 that
 like
 movement
 has
 a
 huge


impact
 kids
 who
 have
 trouble
 sitting


still
 and
 especially
 boys
 and
 especially


young
 boys
 and
 so
 I
 think
 we
 only
 view


some
 of
 their
 behaviors
 as
 maladaptive


when
 we
 ask
 them
 to
 sit
 still
 for
 10


hours
 in
 a
 row
 and
 so
 I
 think
 we
 should


kind
 of
 reorient
 uh
 some
 of
 the
 school


environment
 to
 to
 what
 we
 know
 about


developmental
 psychology
 moving
 on
 to


careers
 and
 um
 and
 jobs
 what
 are
 the


your
 findings
 what
 are
 the
 implications


for
 how
 we
 should
 structure
 our
 working


life
 we
 should
 be
 expecting
 change
 right


we
 want
 people
 to
 figure
 out
 um
 what


they
 want
 to
 do
 and
 and
 we're
 usually


pressuring
 people
 to
 do
 that
 kind
 of


maybe
 in
 their
 early
 20s
 uh
 at
 least
 in


the
 United
 States
 like
 right
 when


they're
 getting
 out
 of
 college
 and
 I


think
 that's
 increasingly
 ill
 suited
 I


guess
 to
 um
 to
 the
 reality
 of
 the


workplace
 so
 there's
 this
 this
 thing


this
 psychological
 finding
 called
 the


end
 of
 History
 illusion
 that's
 this
 idea


this
 finding
 that
 when
 you
 ask
 people


hey
 have
 you
 learned
 a
 lot
 about


yourself
 you
 know
 and
 and
 what
 you're


good
 at
 and
 what
 you
 want
 to
 do
 and
 what


you're
 bad
 at
 in
 the
 past
 and
 people
 say


like
 oh
 yeah
 of
 course
 and
 then
 you
 ask


well
 will
 you
 learn
 more
 in
 the
 future


or
 people
 say
 not
 so
 much
 now
 I'm
 pretty


much
 done
 and
 at
 every
 time
 point
 in


life
 people
 say
 I
 learned
 a
 lot
 in
 the


past
 but
 now
 I
 think
 I'm
 now
 I
 think


I've
 arrived
 so
 we're
 like
 Works
 in


progress
 constantly
 claiming
 to
 be


finished
 and
 this
 continues
 throughout


our
 life
 but
 the
 fastest
 time
 of


Personality
 change
 which
 is
 again
 what


you
 think
 your
 strengths
 and
 weaknesses


are
 what
 your
 values
 are
 what
 you
 like


in
 friends
 Etc
 is
 about
 18
 to
 the
 late


20s
 and
 that's
 the
 time
 when
 we're


telling
 people
 you
 have
 to
 have
 sort
 of


you
 know
 figured
 out
 and
 that's
 not
 to


say
 people
 shouldn't
 dive
 into
 stuff
 you


should
 dive
 into
 stuff
 because
 that's


how
 you
 get
 a
 signal
 about
 whether


you're
 doing
 the
 right
 thing
 or
 not
 but


I
 think
 we
 need
 to
 be
 prepared
 uh
 for


Change
 and
 kind
 of
 keep
 keep
 dabbling


and
 keep
 doing
 some
 of
 that


experimenting
 there
 there's
 a


fascinating
 study
 that
 came
 out
 too


recently
 uh
 for
 me
 to
 to
 get
 into
 my


book
 was
 by
 researchers
 at
 Northwestern


this
 guy
 Dash
 Wong
 who
 just
 says
 this


incredible
 it's
 it's
 like
 people
 will
 do


a
 study
 of
 uh
 20
 careers
 and
 dash
 Wong


will
 do
 a
 study
 of
 20,000
 careers
 like


it's
 just
 his
 work
 is
 just
 on
 another


level
 and
 so
 he
 and
 his
 colleagues
 did


this
 analysis
 of
 I
 think
 it
 was


26,000
 career
 trajectories
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 them
 were
 like
 uh
 artists
 film


directors
 scientists
 and
 what
 they
 found


was
 that
 there
 was
 actually
 this
 kind
 of


universal
 first
 of
 all
 they
 found
 that


most
 people
 do
 their
 most
 impactful
 work


in
 their
 life
 in
 a
 so-called
 hot
 streak


like
 their
 best
 work
 tends
 to
 tends
 to


kind
 of
 cluster
 now
 sometimes
 those


clusters
 can
 extend
 for
 quite
 a
 while
 um


but
 there
 tends
 to
 be
 tends
 to
 be
 a


cluster
 and
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 they


aren't
 doing
 failures
 at
 the
 same
 time


but
 the
 hits
 tend
 to
 be
 sort
 of


clustered
 and
 sometimes
 people
 have
 two


sometimes
 people
 just
 have
 one
 but
 what


they
 found
 was
 reliably
 before
 a
 hot


streak
 people
 spend
 time
 in
 this
 period


of
 experimentation
 and
 it
 really
 jives


with
 this
 big
 body
 of
 literature
 called


on
 on
 What's
 called
 the
 explore
 exploit


tradeoff
 where
 explore
 is
 is
 searching


for
 new
 knowledge
 trying
 new
 skills


trying
 new
 projects
 trying
 new


collaborators
 exploit
 is
 taking
 stuff


that
 you
 already
 know
 and
 people
 you


already
 know
 and
 and
 digging
 down
 on


that
 and
 and
 making
 the
 most
 value
 out


of
 it
 and
 what
 they
 found
 is
 that
 this


explore
 phase
 is
 it
 always
 precedes
 like


a
 successful
 exploit
 and
 you
 know
 when


I've
 talked
 to
 to
 Dash
 and
 I
 think
 part


of
 his
 concern
 is
 that
 in
 the
 race
 to


kind
 of
 find
 a
 specialty
 because
 we
 all


we
 all
 specialize
 to
 one
 degree
 or


another
 at
 some
 point
 or
 another
 uh


unless
 we
 just
 become
 complete
 diletant


forever
 what
 his
 concern
 is
 that
 people


are
 rushing
 past
 pass
 the
 explore


straight
 to
 the
 exploit
 which
 undermines


the
 the
 chance
 that
 they'll
 ever
 have
 so


what
 does
 this
 explore
 period
 look
 like


what
 is
 it
 yeah
 so
 let's
 take
 for


example
 when
 he
 was
 looking
 at
 you
 know


scientists
 I
 I
 read
 a
 lot
 of
 science


about
 science
 um
 and
 and
 scientists
 like


to
 do
 it
 because
 they're
 interested
 in


themselves
 um
 but
 there
 will
 be
 a


scientist
 who's
 getting
 involved
 in


different
 areas
 right
 they're
 starting


little
 projects
 and
 usually
 with
 smaller


groups
 or
 on
 their
 own
 they're
 trying
 a


bunch
 of
 different
 things
 and
 then


they'll
 maybe
 find
 one
 area
 that
 seems


more
 fruit
 and
 suddenly
 they'll
 then


start
 like
 ramping
 up
 you
 know
 it's


almost
 like
 personal
 R&D
 would
 be
 for
 a


company
 it's
 like
 they're
 they're
 sort


of
 like
 prototyping
 different
 different


lives
 that
 they
 could
 have
 or
 different


careers
 they
 could
 have
 and
 then
 when


they
 find
 one
 that
 seems
 better
 then


they
 expand
 the
 collaboration
 Network


they
 put
 more
 resources
 into
 that
 and
 go


forward
 or
 for
 artists
 sometimes
 it
 was


it
 was
 experimenting
 with
 like
 a
 a
 bunch


of
 different
 styles
 and
 then
 merging


something
 from
 those
 different


experiments
 into
 a
 new
 style
 that
 they


then
 really
 drill
 down
 on
 so
 I
 think


it's
 this
 this
 sense
 of
 as
 I
 think
 of
 it


of
 sort
 of
 prototyping
 your
 possible


lives
 and
 careers
 and
 taking
 a
 little


bit
 from
 these
 little
 experiments
 and


saying
 all
 right
 now
 now
 it's
 time
 to


kind
 of
 drill
 down
 put
 more
 resources


often
 putting
 more
 of
 a
 network
 you
 know


and
 and
 in
 some
 cases
 when
 the
 careers


were
 uh
 in
 business
 or
 in
 science


actually
 then
 Gathering
 a
 much
 larger


group
 of
 people
 uh
 to
 to
 then
 work
 on
 I


mean
 this
 is
 uh
 really
 interesting
 but
 I


mean
 you
 have
 some
 people
 of
 course
 like


Einstein
 he
 did
 his
 work
 in
 a
 pretty
 I


mean
 the
 greatest
 work
 in
 a
 pretty
 short


period
 of
 time
 you
 know
 uh
 Monk


um
 same
 kind
 of
 things
 but
 you
 got
 other


you
 got
 other
 artists
 uh
 you
 know


Beatles
 went
 on
 forever
 right
 picazo
 had


one
 period
 after
 the
 other
 went
 on


forever
 Reinventing
 himself
 what


explains
 the
 difference
 here
 I
 mean


those
 I
 think
 first
 of
 all
 those
 are


those
 are
 incredible
 innovators
 and
 I


think
 those
 you
 know
 I
 think
 looking
 at


the
 career
 of
 Picasso
 I
 think
 he
 had


more
 hot
 streaks
 than
 the
 next
 person


bet
 um
 but
 he
 did
 continually
 go
 through


these
 like
 he
 would
 Contin
 enforce
 these


constraints
 on
 himself
 right
 like
 his


red
 period
 or
 blue
 period
 or
 whatever
 it


was
 or
 sometimes
 he
 would
 paint
 the
 same


subject
 over
 and
 over
 and
 over
 and
 over


and
 over
 and
 over
 but
 forcing
 it
 to
 be


different
 kind
 of
 every
 time
 and
 so
 I


think
 he
 was
 just
 this
 Relentless


experimenter
 um
 and
 you
 know
 and
 there


is
 also
 when
 I
 think
 of
 Picasso
 this


pretty
 consistent
 finding
 that
 great


creators
 just
 create
 more
 stuff
 so
 they


they
 create
 a
 lot
 of
 bad
 stuff
 too
 you


know
 it's
 like
 the
 proverbial
 Thomas


Edison
 thousands
 of
 patents
 most
 of


which
 are
 completely
 useless
 and
 some
 of


which
 are
 like
 the
 mass-produced
 light


bulb
 you
 know
 and
 so
 I
 think
 there's
 not


dispositive
 evidence
 of
 this
 this
 is
 me


speculating
 but
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 that
 the
 creating
 so
 much
 more


is
 is
 kind
 of
 a
 Hallmark
 of
 these
 great


creators
 is
 that
 that's
 actually
 really


the
 only
 way
 you
 learn
 that
 that


introspection
 I
 think
 has
 been
 oversold


as
 a
 method
 for
 learning
 about
 yourself


and
 doing
 stuff
 has
 been
 been
 undersold


is
 curiosity
 a


choice
 wow
 that's
 a
 tough
 question
 I


mean
 I
 think
 there's
 you
 know
 my
 first


book
 was
 about
 genetics
 and
 I
 think
 the


the
 so-called
 first
 law
 of
 behavioral


genetics
 is
 that
 every
 uh
 personality


trait
 that
 has
 ever
 been
 studied
 has
 a


genetic
 component
 so
 I
 think
 there
 is
 an


innate
 component
 to


curiosity
 um
 that
 said
 I
 think
 that


people
 are
 inherently
 more


Curious
 um
 if
 they
 don't
 think
 it's


disincentivized
 right
 like
 I
 would
 even


talk
 to
 some
 of
 the
 the
 researchers
 I


was
 interviewing
 for
 my
 book
 who
 were


dis
 appointed
 at
 their
 careers
 in


Academia
 because
 they
 felt
 that
 they
 had


gotten
 into
 this
 world
 where
 it'
 be
 the


life
 of
 the
 mind
 and
 yet
 then
 they
 were


told
 like
 I
 remember
 interviewing
 this


one
 researcher
 who
 she
 said
 she
 felt


frustrated
 that
 she
 felt
 like
 she
 was


maybe
 being
 held
 back
 in
 her
 career


because
 she
 wasn't
 more
 specialized


because
 she
 wanted
 to
 explore
 more
 stuff


and
 I
 went
 and
 looked
 at
 her
 list
 of


papers
 every
 single
 one
 it
 was
 like
 48


papers
 or
 something
 every
 single
 one
 had


Aristotle
 in
 the
 title
 like
 from
 my


perspective
 she
 was
 very
 specialized


every
 single
 one
 um
 and
 so
 I
 think
 I


think
 people
 want
 to
 be
 curious
 but
 they


often
 feel
 that
 it's
 disincentivized
 and


then
 sometimes
 people
 get
 to
 a
 level


where
 they're
 sort
 of
 Executives
 or
 in


Silicon
 Valley
 and
 then
 they
 they
 get
 to


be
 free
 and
 really
 curious
 and
 I
 think


you
 see
 some
 of
 the
 kind
 of
 flourishing


when
 people
 feel
 like
 that's


incentivized
 um
 but
 I
 think
 I
 think


specific
 curiosity
 is
 is
 is
 important


and
 underrated
 and
 that
 we
 need
 to


encourage
 people
 sometimes
 to
 dive
 into


problems
 that
 interest
 them
 or
 that
 they


think
 are
 important
 that
 maybe
 are
 not


exactly
 in
 their
 their
 view
 every
 day


like
 there's
 a
 guy
 who
 was
 the
 first


named
 ed
 Hoffman
 who
 was
 a
 background


source
 for
 me
 who
 was
 the
 first
 Chief


knowledge
 officer
 at
 Nasa
 that's


basically
 when
 NASA
 had
 some
 accidents


they
 created
 this
 position
 that
 was
 for


a
 psychologist
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 they


had
 institutional
 memory
 make
 sure
 that


they
 were
 learning
 from
 their
 mistakes


and
 that
 those
 learnings
 were
 spreading


across
 the
 organization
 and
 now
 he


consults
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 organizations
 and


one
 of
 the
 things
 he
 does
 is
 he
 goes
 in


and
 he
 asks


people
 uh
 when
 he's
 just
 sort
 of
 first


doing
 his
 listening
 T
 her
 what's


something
 you're
 good
 at
 that
 we're
 not


using
 and
 what
 he
 finds
 is
 that
 people


will
 often
 bring
 up
 some
 problem
 that's


in
 their
 office
 that
 they
 basically
 know


how
 to
 fix
 but
 they
 don't
 feel


incentivized
 or
 or
 even
 allowed
 to
 to
 do


it
 so
 I
 think
 there's
 like
 a
 lot
 of


innate
 curiosity
 that
 if
 if
 leaders
 or


managers
 are
 willing
 to
 underwrite
 the


risk
 of
 those
 curious
 people
 in
 in


taking
 some
 risk
 that
 that
 would
 be


basically
 um
 Unleashed
 whether
 or
 not
 we


can
 just
 create
 a
 lot
 more
 innate


curiosity
 for
 people
 I'm
 not
 sure
 but
 I


think
 there's
 a
 lot
 that
 is
 suppressed


that
 we
 could
 just
 kind
 of
 liberate
 is


this
 something
 you
 can
 work
 on
 through


mentoring
 you
 think
 I
 absolutely
 do
 I


absolutely
 do
 and
 again
 I
 think
 that


that
 issue
 of
 um
 underwriting
 risk
 for


people
 who
 are
 lower
 level
 or
 lower


status
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 when
 you
 say


underwrite
 risk
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 in


practice
 so
 let's
 say
 like
 having


someone
 do
 an
 experiment
 maybe
 they're


working
 on
 a
 new
 project
 or
 working
 uh


with
 a
 new
 team
 so
 there's
 some
 places


that
 do
 this
 with
 their
 like
 3m.
 or


Google
 with
 their
 things
 like
 20%
 time


where
 they
 say
 like
 no
 we
 want
 you
 to
 go


do
 this
 thing
 that
 will
 probably
 fail


with
 20%
 of
 your
 time
 time
 like
 take
 on


this
 personal
 project
 and
 and
 like


Google's
 X
 their
 their
 sort
 of


innovation
 engine
 area
 they
 have
 these


videos
 called
 it
 gets
 better
 where


people
 worked
 on
 these
 huge
 projects
 and


then
 the
 projects
 you
 know
 like
 floating


high-speed
 internet
 on
 hot
 air
 balloons


and
 and
 the
 technology
 worked
 but
 the


economics
 didn't
 work
 and
 so
 they
 made
 a


video
 called
 it
 gets
 better
 where
 the


people
 who
 put
 their
 lives
 into
 this
 and


then
 the
 project
 gets
 closed
 talk
 about


the
 period
 of
 mourning
 and
 grieving
 and


then
 the
 stuff
 that
 they
 learned
 that


they
 then
 took
 and
 applied
 to
 some
 new


project
 so
 it's
 this
 they're
 almost


trying
 to
 valorize
 this
 idea
 that
 hey
 we


took
 on
 something
 that
 we
 was
 worth


taking
 on
 whether
 it
 worked
 or
 not
 like


we
 had
 to
 figure
 this
 out
 we
 had
 some


lessons
 from
 it
 and
 so
 you
 see
 these


examples
 of
 people
 who
 then
 uh
 recover


and
 go
 into
 other
 into
 other
 projects
 do


you
 think
 this
 is
 why
 it
 seems
 like


older
 um
 founders
 of
 companies
 actually


have
 a
 higher
 probability
 to
 succeed
 I
 I


do
 yeah
 that's
 and
 I
 know
 that's


a
 for
 some
 people
 a
 controversial
 uh
 uh


finding
 like
 I
 know
 you
 know
 Paul
 Graham


who
 I
 think
 obviously
 is
 a
 brilliant
 uh


guy
 one
 of
 founder
 of
 why
 combinator
 I


think
 was
 um
 not
 so
 happy
 that
 I
 wrote


about
 that
 finding
 but
 there's
 this


finding
 with
 the
 you
 know
 I
 think
 that


you're
 referring
 to
 like
 with
 MIT
 and


the
 US
 Census
 Bureau
 in
 Northwestern


that
 found
 that
 the
 average
 age
 of
 a


founder
 of
 a
 fast
 growing
 Tech
 startup


uh
 on
 the
 day
 of
 founding
 was
 45
 right


we
 had
 re
 Hastings
 on
 the
 show
 he


founded
 Netflix
 very
 late
 I
 I
 think
 we


put
 much
 more
 attention
 to
 the
 stories


of
 like
 Mark
 Zuckerberg
 who
 famously


dropped
 out
 of
 Harvard
 and
 he
 he


famously
 said
 young
 people
 are
 just


smarter
 he
 was
 22
 when
 he
 said
 that


right
 you
 don't
 hear
 him
 saying
 that


anymore
 surprise
 surprise
 um
 and
 and
 so


I
 think
 it's
 sort
 of
 counterintuitive


you
 and
 I
 we're
 not
 saying
 it
 either
 are


we
 no
 not
 anymore
 um
 and
 and
 maybe
 we


did
 at
 one
 point
 but
 we
 weren't
 recorded


like
 Mark
 Zuckerberg
 lucky
 for
 us
 um
 but


no
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 I
 think
 that's


absolutely
 the
 case
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 it


comes
 through
 this
 pivoting
 and
 this


sort
 of


opportunistic
 right
 and
 I
 think
 some
 of


this
 like
 belies
 the
 idea
 that
 you
 can


just
 have
 this
 clear
 life
 course
 and


execute
 according
 to


plan
 and
 really
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 great


innovation
 in
 people's
 career
 moves


comes
 from
 being
 opportunistic
 and
 see


seeing
 learning
 something
 about
 an
 area


seeing
 an
 opportunity
 and
 then
 pivoting


to
 to
 to
 take
 advantage
 of
 it
 you
 know


um
 as
 opposed
 to
 being
 part
 of
 some
 like


perfect
 long-term
 plan
 I've
 yet
 to
 meet


an
 entrepreneur
 who
 said
 like
 yeah


things
 went
 as
 planned
 it
 never
 happens


they
 all
 say
 they
 nearly
 died
 three


times
 but
 um
 what
 are
 the
 when
 we
 put


all
 these
 together
 what
 are
 the


implications
 for
 how
 you
 build
 and


organize
 a


company
 you
 know
 how
 what
 how
 do
 you


think
 about
 range
 in
 an
 organization


yeah
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 one
 thing
 is
 getting


a
 little
 more
 diversity
 in
 in
 teams


right
 so
 there's
 this
 like
 pretty


compelling
 body
 of
 work
 that
 shows
 that


when
 a
 team
 faces
 uh
 a
 problem


particularly
 an
 unfamiliar
 problem
 you


know
 a
 difficult
 problem


the
 their
 likelihood
 of
 solving
 it
 and


the
 number
 of
 different
 solutions
 they


come
 up
 with
 is
 in
 part
 predicted
 by
 the


number
 and
 breadth
 of
 analogies
 that


they
 can
 come
 up
 with
 to
 structurally


similar
 problems
 in
 other
 areas
 so


saying
 like
 is
 that
 like
 this
 is
 that


like
 that
 and
 what
 predicts
 the
 number


and
 breadth
 of
 analogies
 is
 the


diversity
 of
 the
 people
 in
 the
 group
 and


so
 in
 many
 cases
 when
 you
 have
 everyone


with
 a
 similar
 specialty
 it's
 not
 that


much
 better
 than
 having
 just
 one
 brain


with
 that
 specialty
 and
 and
 some
 of


these
 findings
 can
 even
 be
 quite
 like


almost
 absurd
 So
 ba
 based
 on
 This


research
 you
 know
 there
 was
 research


looking
 at
 teams
 okay
 if
 you
 throw
 in


someone
 with
 a
 different
 specialty
 does


that
 help
 problem
 solving
 okay
 yes
 it


does
 what
 if
 you
 throw
 in
 someone
 from
 a


different
 area
 who's
 like
 not
 really


that


competent
 still
 helps
 some
 and
 then
 it


said
 well
 let's
 take
 it
 to
 the
 farthest


extension
 we'll
 look
 at
 remote
 teams


working
 on
 problems
 and
 we'll
 toss
 in
 AI


Bots
 programmed
 to
 behave
 randomly
 you


know
 they
 don't
 know
 our
 Bots
 because


this
 is
 just
 a
 remote
 remote
 team


even
 that
 improve
 problem
 solving


because
 it
 apparently
 gets
 people
 to
 to


De
 anchor
 right
 CU
 usually
 the
 first


solution
 that
 comes
 to
 mind
 is
 the
 one


that
 we
 sort
 of
 get
 stuck
 on
 or
 anchored


the
 first
 or
 second
 and
 these
 random


Behavior
 would
 actually
 kind
 of
 knock


people
 off
 of
 uh
 those
 those
 anchored


Solutions
 because
 it
 turns
 out
 we


usually
 anchor
 on
 a
 first
 solution
 and


it's
 usually
 not
 our
 our
 best
 one
 so


this
 this
 thing
 called
 the
 creative


Cliff
 illusion
 that's
 like
 we
 think
 good


ideas
 come
 either
 quickly
 or
 not
 at
 all


when
 in
 fact
 actually
 they
 tend
 to
 come


later
 in
 your
 in
 your
 thought
 process
 so


I
 think
 mixing
 mixing
 cross
 functional


teams
 um
 and
 I
 think
 saving
 some
 room


for
 people
 that
 seem
 a
 little
 a
 little


different
 like
 some
 of
 the
 I
 think
 sort


of
 most
 kind
 of
 progressive
 companies


I've
 been
 around
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 they


disrupt
 themselves
 instead
 of
 waiting
 to


get


disrupted
 will
 will
 put
 some
 effort
 at


least
 into
 hiring
 like
 sometimes
 they


just
 need
 to
 put
 a
 square
 peg
 in
 a


square
 hole
 today
 but
 other
 times


they'll
 save
 some
 efforts
 for
 like
 sort


of
 around
 and
 saying
 okay
 here
 are


things
 we're
 really
 good
 at
 that
 we
 can


teach
 people
 how
 to


do
 there's
 some
 other
 things
 we
 want


that
 we're
 not
 good
 at
 or
 that
 we


couldn't
 show
 people
 how
 to
 do
 so
 let's


let's
 go
 look
 for
 people
 who
 have
 those


things
 bring
 them
 in
 and
 then
 we'll


teach
 them
 the
 stuff
 that
 we're
 good
 at


teaching
 right
 so
 the
 I
 think
 the


farthest
 extreme
 of
 this
 that
 I


encountered
 was
 bayy
 gford
 which
 I
 think


is
 like
 the
 most
 successful
 Investment


Company
 in
 Scotland
 where
 they
 would
 not


hire
 anyone
 with
 an
 MBA
 I
 think
 that's
 a


little
 overboard
 um
 but
 maybe
 part
 of


their
 culture
 but
 they
 would
 say
 let's


just
 go
 look
 for
 things
 that
 we
 want
 in


here
 and
 then
 we
 can
 teach
 them
 the


finance
 stuff
 y
 um
 and
 so
 so
 I
 think


that's
 kind
 of
 extreme
 but
 it
 comports


with
 with
 like
 the
 work
 of
 Abby
 Griffin


who
 studies
 so-called
 serial
 innovators


these
 people
 who
 make
 repeated
 creative


contributions
 to
 their
 organizations
 she


finds
 these
 people
 are
 you
 know
 just
 to


almost
 directly
 quote
 from
 her
 work
 they


uh
 they
 have
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 Interest


they
 read
 more
 and
 more
 widely
 than


their
 peers
 they
 have
 a
 need
 to


communicate
 with
 people
 with
 expertise


outside
 of
 their
 own
 they
 connect


information
 from
 different
 domains
 um


they
 repurpose
 like
 old
 things
 that
 are


already
 available
 they
 systems
 thinkers


all
 this
 stuff
 and
 they
 have
 more


different
 type
 of
 friends
 they
 have
 more


different
 type
 of
 friends
 that's
 right


they
 use
 their
 social
 networks
 to


diversify
 the
 inputs
 they
 have
 uh
 coming


at
 one
 point
 she
 says
 they
 appear
 they


often
 appear
 to
 flit
 among
 ideas
 which


doesn't
 really
 sound
 like
 a
 compliment


but
 I
 think
 the
 danger
 is
 those
 people


um
 you
 know
 they
 can
 just
 seem
 like


they're
 scattered
 yeah
 I
 I
 talked
 to


Adam
 Grant
 I
 think
 our
 mutual
 uh
 friend


about
 this
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 I
 think
 said


well
 can
 you
 create
 these
 serial


innovators
 and
 I
 think
 the
 answer


is
 not
 sure
 my
 my
 intuition
 is
 probably


not
 that
 you
 can't
 just
 create
 them
 but


I
 think
 absolutely
 you
 can
 stifle
 them


from
 becoming
 if
 you
 don't
 allow
 that


that
 sort
 of
 broad
 networking
 and
 Broad


thinking
 what
 does
 artificial


intelligence
 uh
 do
 to
 the
 need
 to


specialize
 do
 we
 need
 more
 or
 less


specialization
 that's
 a
 great
 question
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 is
 is
 unknown
 at


this
 point
 um
 but
 don't
 we
 have
 all


information
 in
 the
 world
 at
 the
 tap
 of


our
 fingers
 do
 we
 really
 need
 to
 study


seven
 years
 for
 a
 PhD
 yeah
 I
 think


there's
 I
 think
 there's
 truth
 to
 that


there's
 more
 information
 available
 than


ever
 um
 and
 that
 people
 need
 to
 we
 need


to
 start
 thinking
 teaching
 people
 how
 to


integrate
 it
 and
 how
 to
 evaluate


evidence
 and
 all
 those
 sorts
 of
 things


so
 I
 think
 first
 of
 all
 everyone
 should


be
 using
 these
 tools
 right
 like
 I
 use


I'm
 on
 like
 Claude
 perplexity
 chat
 gbt


every
 day
 and
 one
 for
 scientific


research
 called


site.
 um
 and
 so
 everyone
 should
 turn
 on


a
 little
 bit
 of
 their
 uh
 technological


Anthropologist
 brain
 and
 be
 using
 these


tools
 to
 figure
 out
 where
 do
 they
 go


right
 and
 where
 do
 they
 go
 wrong
 because


my
 experience
 has
 been
 they're
 very


often
 wrong
 and
 yet
 very
 useful
 so
 it's


it's
 interesting
 to
 get
 used
 to
 a
 tool


that's
 very
 often
 wrong
 but
 also
 useful


but
 in
 in
 the
 larger
 scheme
 of
 things


you
 know
 I
 think


whether
 technological
 innovation
 of
 this


magnitude
 leads
 to
 Shared
 Prosperity
 or


increasing
 misery
 um
 has
 a
 lot
 to
 do


with
 whether
 people
 are
 have


opportunities
 to
 and
 are
 able
 to
 adapt


to
 to
 sort
 of
 new
 roles
 that
 that
 move


them
 to
 a
 bigger
 picture
 scale
 so
 to


give
 a
 sense
 of
 what
 I
 mean
 like
 in
 the


when
 I
 was
 looking
 back
 I
 was
 kind
 of


doing
 some
 research
 on
 the
 introduction


of
 the
 ATM
 you
 know
 the
 the
 automat
 like


a
 cash
 machine
 in
 the
 US
 and
 it
 first


came
 online
 in
 the
 early
 70s
 and
 the


news
 coverage
 at
 the
 time
 was
 really


apocalyptic
 it's
 like
 there
 were
 300,000


bank
 tellers
 at
 the
 time
 said
 they're


going
 to
 go
 out
 of
 business
 overnight


and
 instead
 over
 the
 next
 40
 years


instead
 of
 as
 there
 were
 more
 ATMs
 there


were
 more
 bank
 tellers
 because
 they
 made


each
 branch
 cheaper
 to
 operate
 so
 Banks


opened
 more
 branches
 so
 fewer
 tellers


per
 Branch
 but
 more
 tellers
 overall
 but


even
 more
 interestingly
 it
 fundamentally


changed
 the
 job
 of
 one
 from
 someone


who's
 doing
 repetitive
 cash
 transactions


to
 someone
 who's
 like
 a
 marketing


professional
 or
 a
 customer
 service


representative
 or
 a
 financial
 adviser


this
 much
 broader
 mix
 of
 more
 strategic


skills
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 kind
 of


emblematic
 of
 when
 technological


disruption
 sort
 of
 goes
 well
 for
 Society


at
 large
 is
 it
 moves
 people
 back
 to
 this


more
 strategic
 level
 of
 thinking
 and


takes
 over
 stuff
 that
 you
 know
 it
 might


be
 scary
 that
 it's
 taking
 it
 over
 but


it's
 like
 less
 of
 the
 place
 where
 we


kind
 of
 add
 value
 and
 so
 I
 think
 you


know
 people
 need
 to
 be
 experimenting


with
 these
 tools
 and
 starting
 to
 think


about
 how
 it
 can
 liberate
 them
 to
 spend


more
 time
 on
 the
 Strategic
 side
 the


bigger
 the
 bird's
 eye
 view
 picture
 of
 of


their
 work
 so
 you
 uh
 boil
 this
 all


together
 uh
 and
 translate
 it
 into
 an


advice
 for
 young
 people
 you
 are
 18
 20
 22


I
 mean
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about


your
 life
 first
 of
 all
 I
 think
 realize


that
 there's
 very
 very
 little
 chance


that
 you're
 headed
 for
 a
 life
 where


you're
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 the
 same
 thing


for
 for
 decades
 over
 so
 you
 should
 be


oriented
 toward
 learning
 growing
 that


means
 continual
 experimentation
 that


means
 broadening
 your
 your
 network
 I


would
 I
 would
 advise
 for
 someone
 in
 that


age
 group
 of
 there
 were
 some
 cool
 kind


of
 MIT
 research
 on
 this
 that
 because
 if


you
 just
 let
 your
 social
 media
 go
 on
 its


own
 kind
 of
 you'll
 end
 up
 following


people
 who
 are
 all
 following
 each
 other


basically
 so
 you'll
 have
 this
 real
 Echo


chamber
 you
 should
 be
 constantly
 pruning


and
 adding
 people
 who
 are
 more
 different


from
 you
 to
 diversify
 the
 the
 sources
 of


input
 and
 I
 think
 you
 should
 be
 doing


purposeful
 experimentation
 so
 I
 keep


something
 I
 call
 a
 book
 of
 small


experiments
 where
 every
 you
 know
 borrow


from
 the
 scientific
 method
 say
 here's


something
 I
 want
 to
 learn
 or
 here's


something
 I
 want
 to
 learn
 about
 here's


my
 hypothesis
 for
 how
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 it


here's
 how
 I'm
 going
 to
 evaluate
 the


outcome
 and
 do
 that
 over
 and
 over
 and


over
 and
 over
 so
 you
 know
 to
 give
 a


concrete
 example
 of
 something
 that's


relevant
 to
 my
 life
 like
 I
 felt
 like
 I


was
 stuck
 in
 a
 rut
 with
 writing
 I
 said
 I


need
 to
 learn
 some
 new
 ways
 to
 structure


writing
 because
 structuring
 information


is
 the
 major
 challenge
 for
 me
 so
 I
 took


a
 beginners
 I
 said
 well
 where's
 their


more
 structure
 okay
 fiction
 so
 I
 took
 a


beginner's
 course
 in
 fiction
 writing
 and


it
 was
 a
 total
 Revelation
 for
 me
 like


there
 was
 one
 exercise
 where
 we
 had
 to


write
 stories
 with
 only
 dialogue
 and


with
 no
 dialogue
 and
 the
 no
 dialogue
 one


was
 so
 much
 better
 and
 I
 realized
 I
 had


been
 overusing
 sort
 of
 dialogue
 I
 went


back
 and
 changed
 it
 you
 know
 like


basically
 every
 page
 of
 range
 and
 so
 I'm


constantly
 doing
 these
 experiments
 where


it's
 make
 a
 hypothesis
 find
 a
 way
 to


test
 it
 reflect
 back
 on
 what
 you
 learned


and
 take
 that
 forward
 so
 I
 think
 more


purposeful
 experimentation
 mindset
 is
 a


really
 crucial
 one
 uh
 for
 you
 know
 and


and
 may
 come
 naturally
 to
 some
 people


who
 are
 just
 like
 incredibly
 curious
 but


not
 to
 not
 to
 most
 people
 um
 but
 I
 think


it's
 really
 crucial
 in
 a
 world
 where


like
 you
 should
 not
 be


uh
 feeling
 entitled
 to
 stability
 of
 the


thing
 that
 you're
 doing
 for
 years
 on
 end


well
 this
 has
 been
 a
 truly
 fantastic


dialogue
 about
 one
 of
 my
 absolute


favorite
 topics
 in
 the
 world
 so
 uh
 a
 big


thanks
 for
 sharing
 your
 thoughts
 and
 uh


all
 the
 best
 with
 the
 rest
 of
 your


research
 that's
 an
 absolute
 pleasure


thanks
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me
