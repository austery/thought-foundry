- The 1918 Nobel Prize for Chemistry
is probably the most important
Nobel Prize ever awarded.
It was given to German
scientist Fritz Haber
for solving one of the biggest problems
humanity has ever faced.
His invention is directly responsible
for the lives of 4 billion people today.
But when he received his prize,
many of his peers refused to attend.
Two other Nobel Prize winners
rejected their awards in protest
and the New York Times wrote
a scathing article about him.
He is simultaneously one
of the most impactful
and tragic scientists of all time.
(dramatic orchestral music)
Perhaps more than any other single person,
he has shaped the world we live in today.

If you are an American citizen
and you find an island with
a lot of bird poop on it,
well then you can claim that island
for the United States and
the US will have your back.
The president is authorized to
send in the Navy and the Army
to defend your newly
discovered poop-covered island.
There are currently 10 American islands
that were claimed in this way.
And even though the law
that made this possible
was passed in 1856,
it is still in effect to this day.
So, why did people want
poop-covered islands so badly?
(birds chirping)
("The Blue Danube")
There are a few dozen
islands off the coast of Peru
where millions of seabirds gather to mate
and the waters near the
island are full of fish,
and these millions of birds eat the fish,
and then they poop,
a lot.
("The Blue Danube")
Since the region is hot and dry,
this poop solidifies and
accumulates over millennia.
There are cliffs of bird poop
30 meters or a hundred feet high.
("The Blue Danube")
And technically bird poop is called guano
and by the mid 1800s,
buying and selling bird
guano was big business.
The price rose as high as $76 per pound
meaning you could trade
four pounds of guano
for one pound of gold.
So, why was there such a
big market for bird poop?
Well, to answer that
we have to look inside the human body.
By weight, most of our
bodies are made up of
oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen.
But the fourth most common
element is nitrogen.
Nitrogen is part of the amino
acids that form proteins.
It's part of hemoglobin,
the compound that carries
oxygen in red blood cells
and it's a central
component of DNA and RNA.
Nitrogen is essential
for all life on earth.
We get our nitrogen by eating plants
or animals which have eaten plants,
and plants get their
nitrogen from the soil.
The problem is if you farm
the same soil year after year,
you harvest the nitrogen out of it
and eventually there isn't enough nitrogen
for healthy plants to grow.
They can't produce enough
chlorophyll to photosynthesize
which stunts their growth.
Their leaves turn yellow
and they are more susceptible
to pests and disease.
Crucially, for farmers,
nitrogen deficiency means smaller yields.
The way to fix this is to add
nitrogen back into the soil
which is where bird guano comes in.
(rhythmic music)
Guano is up to 20% nitrogen.
Hundreds of years ago,
Incan farmers realized
that adding guano to their
soil made crops grow taller.
This is what allowed them to grow food
in places that were previously unfarmable
and expand their empire.
South America's rich deposits of bird poop
did not go unnoticed by
the rest of the world.
In 1865, Spain went to war
against its former colonies
of Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia
for control of their guano-laden islands.
But such was the world's
appetite for nitrogen
that by 1872 guano was running out
and Peru banned further exports.
The world would need another
way to get its nitrogen fix.
(tense music)
This was a crisis.
William Crooks, a British chemist,
made a dire prophecy in 1898.
With the world's growing population
and dwindling supplies of nitrogen,
he said, "We stand in deadly peril
of not having enough to eat."
In less than 30 years time, he argued,
people all over the world
will be dying of starvation,
but he also proposed a solution.
"It is the chemist who
must come to the rescue.
It is through the laboratory
that starvation may ultimately
be turned into plenty."
Because here's the thing,
nitrogen isn't rare,
it's common.
78% of the air is nitrogen
but it's in a form that
plants and animals can't use.
Two atoms of nitrogen
triple bonded together.
This bond is one of the
strongest in nature.
The way to measure the
strength of a chemical bond
is by the amount of energy
that's required to break it.
So, to break apart two
chlorine atoms, for example,
would take 2 1/2 electron volts.
To break apart two
carbons requires 3.8 eV.
Two oxygens, 5.2 eV.
But to break apart two atoms of nitrogen
requires 9.8 electron volts,
a tremendous amount of energy.

I just want to interject to say
that the molecular models in this video
were actually invented by me.
These are Snatoms, a product I kickstarted
about eight years ago
where all the atoms snapped
together magnetically.
So, you can feel the
attraction between atoms
and hear the energy released
(atoms clicks)
when bonds form.
The resulting molecules look and behave
more like real molecules
and they are quicker and
easier to form and break apart.
Snatoms are for sale on
Amazon and snatoms.com.
So, I will put some links
down in the description.
Now, this video is a repost.
The original upload got
over 14 million views
and then suddenly it was
age-restricted and demonetized.
But I think it's a really good video,
so we're reposting it with
the offending section removed.
It's a reminder that
you can't always count
on YouTube monetization.

And now back to splitting
nitrogen molecules.
(models clattering)
(thunder claps)
There are two processes
that do this naturally.
Lightning releases so much energy,
it breaks apart in two into
individual nitrogen atoms.
They then quickly react
to form nitrogen oxides
and these molecules stay in the atmosphere
until they react with
water droplets in clouds
and fall to the ground in rain.
There are also a few types
of bacteria living in soil
that can break the N2 bond
using a tremendous amount
of energy to do so,
and they make nitrogen
available for plants.
But bacteria only replenish
the nitrogen slowly
and there's not enough lightning
to produce nitrogen compounds at scale.
So, chemists tried.
In 1811, Georg Hildebrandt
mixed nitrogen and hydrogen
in a sealed flask trying to make ammonia,
one of the nitrogen-containing
molecules found in guano.
When that didn't work,
he submerged the flask
300 meters underwater
to increase the pressure
and that didn't work either,
but he was on the right track.
Increasingly sophisticated
versions of these experiments
were carried out over the
following hundred years.
All of them failed.
So, when Fritz Haber became
interested in this problem in 1904,
he was joining a long
line of failed chemists.
He was 36 years old, working
as a low level academic
at the University of Karlsruhe.
He was also a new father
with a two-year-old boy named
Herman and a wife, Clara,
who was one of the first women
to get a PhD in chemistry.
Driven by pride and competition
with another scientist,
Haber spent five years on the problem.
His idea was to combine
nitrogen and hydrogen
not only at high pressure,
but also at high temperature,
and in the presence of a catalyst,
something that lowers the amount of energy
required to split diatomic nitrogen.
To do this, new experimental
apparatus had to be invented.
Haber worked tirelessly on this project
building equipment that could tolerate
ever higher temperatures and pressures.
He also got lucky.
At the time he was moonlighting
as a technical consultant
for a light bulb manufacturer.
So, there he had access
to lots of really hard to find materials.
Like the element osmium.
Osmium is rare.
In his day, there was
only about 100 kilograms
of the refined metal in existence
but the company he worked
for was experimenting
with using it for filaments
in their light bulbs.
So, they had most of the world's supply.
Haber suspected it might
make the perfect catalyst
so he brought a sample back to his lab.
And there in the third week of March 1909,
Haber placed his sheet of
osmium in the pressure chamber
and then he pressurized
and heated the nitrogen
and hydrogen to 200 atmospheres
and 500 degrees Celsius.
Under these conditions, the
triple bonds broke apart
and nitrogen reacted with hydrogen.
Of the total gas mixture,
6% turned into ammonia.
When the gas was cooled,
one milliliter of ammonia dripped out
the end of a narrow tube into a beaker.
An elated Haber rushed from
one lab to another, yelling,
"Come on down.
There's ammonia."
Germany's biggest chemical company, BASF,
commercialized Haber's process.
Within four years, they had
opened a factory in Oppau
producing five tons of ammonia per day.
("Symphony No. 9 in D Minor")
People spoke of making bread from the air.
("Symphony No. 9 in D Minor")
With the fertilizer from
this industrial process
on the same plot of land,
farmers were able to grow
four times as much food
and as a result, the population
of the earth quadrupled.
There's a good chance you owe your life
to Haber's invention.
The Earth supports 4
billion more people today
than it could without nitrogen fertilizer.
In fact, around 50% of the
nitrogen atoms in your body
came from the Haber process.
(wheat rustling)
The invention made Fritz
Haber a wealthy man.
He got a promotion becoming
the founding director
of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
for Physical Chemistry in Berlin.
He also befriended some of
the best scientists of his day
including Max Planck, Max
Born, and Albert Einstein.
After Einstein separated
from his first wife in 1914,
he stayed the night at Haber's house.
But if Haber was so well-regarded,
why was he shunned by colleagues
when he won the Nobel Prize?
Well, it all comes down to
what happened in World War I.
When the war broke out,
Haber volunteered for military duty.
Unlike pacifist Einstein
who denounced the war,
Haber was a patriot.
He wanted to use his
expertise to help his country.
Only a few months into the war,
the German army was already
running out of gunpowder and explosives.
Ammonium nitrate, besides
being an excellent fertilizer,
is also an explosive.
Just look at what happened
in Beirut in August of 2020.
(explosion booming)
(crowd screaming)
A warehouse containing almost 3,000 tons
of ammonium nitrate caught fire.
And in the extreme heat,
the fertilizer detonated.
The blast which could be heard
hundreds of kilometers away
killed at least 217 people
and injured thousands more.
Seismometers registered
an artificial earthquake
measuring 3.3 on the Richter scale.
This is just one of many
fertilizer-related explosions.
The Oppau plant where Haber's process
was first put into practice
would also explode in 1921.
And the reason is nitrogen.
We've already seen that
it takes a tremendous
amount of energy to break
apart nitrogen's triple bond.
But the flip side of that coin
is that when two nitrogen
atoms come together
and form that bond,
(atoms clicks)
a huge amount of energy is released.
The explosions of gunpowder,
TNT, nitroglycerin,
and ammonium nitrate all form
diatomic nitrogen gas as a product.
And the formation of that triple bond
is where these chemicals derive
much of their explosive energy.
Haber lobbied to convert the factories
using his process to make
ammonia for fertilizer
to create nitrate for explosives instead.
His superiors believed such a
conversion to be impossible,
but Haber persisted,
and soon his chemical process
was at the heart of
the German war machine.
From bread out of the air
to bombs out of the air.
(gun popping)
But Haber thought chemistry could make
an even bigger contribution to the war.
In December 1914, he witnessed
a chemical weapons test.
He was unimpressed.
Haber believed that he could do better.
He set out to make a gas
that was deadly at low concentrations
and heavier than air
so it would sink into enemy trenches.
Projectiles carrying
chemical weapons were banned,
at least in theory, by the
Hague Convention of 1899.
But in practice after
the start of the war,
Germany, France, and Britain
all experimented with chemical weapons.
Haber converted his wing of the institute
into a chemical weapons laboratory
and after only a few months of work,
he zeroed in on chlorine gas.
An employee, Otto Hahn,
expressed his discomfort
about the new weapon.
Haber told him, "Innumerable
human lives would be saved
if the war could be ended
more quickly in this way."
(somber music)
At 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd of April,
with the wind blowing
toward the allied trenches,
German troops released
168 tons of chlorine
from over 5,000 gas cylinders.
The wall of gas advanced
across the battlefield.
Since chlorine gas is 2
1/2 times heavier than air,
it sank into the trenches
of the Allied soldiers.
Any soldier that inhaled
a lung full of the gas
suffered a terrible death.
Chlorine irritates the
mucus lining of the lungs
so violently that they fill with liquid.
The soldiers effectively
drowned on dry land.
(somber music)
More than 5,000 Allied
soldiers died this way
in the first attack.
(somber music)
Haber was promoted to the rank of captain.
Haber spent the rest of the
war running his institute
researching chemical weapons,
gas masks, and pesticides.
By 1917, the institute
employed 1,500 people
including 150 scientists.
It was like a mini Manhattan project
but for chemical weapons.
In total, 100,000 soldiers were killed
by chemical weapons in World War I.
When Germany surrendered,
Haber was crushed.
All the money he made
from his ammonia patent
was lost to hyperinflation.
In an attempt to pay off
Germany's crippling war debt,
he tried to distill gold from seawater
but the project was futile.
In 1933, the Nazis came to power
and passed a law that
all Jewish civil servants
including scientists, were
to be fired from their jobs.
Haber was Jewish but he
never practiced the religion.
Regardless, his military service
exempted him from the law
but he resigned from his role as director
in solidarity with all
the Jewish scientists
who worked at the institute.
(pensive music)
The next year in a hotel
room in Basel, Switzerland,
he died of heart failure.
Immediately after World War I,
Haber's Institute developed
a cyanide-based insecticide.
It had a barely detectable odor
so, they mixed in a foul-smelling chemical
to alert people to the danger.
The resulting gas was called Zyklon B.
A decade after Haber's death,
the Nazis requested chemists remove
the foul-smelling component
and this form of Zyklon B,
the chemical developed
at Haber's Institute
was then used to perpetrate the Holocaust.
(slow tense music)
Thinking about this story,
it would be easy to
paint Haber as a villain
or as a hero for inventing the process
used to feed half the world.
But another approach is to regard him as
irrelevant to the larger story
because someone else
would've figured out a way
to process nitrogen out of the air
and other scientists were
developing chemical weapons.
Over the past few centuries,
science and technology have
improved our lives immeasurably
but they have also given
us ever increasing ways
to destroy ourselves.
I think it'd be great to believe
that we could ask scientists
to only work on problems
that are good for humanity.
But the reality is that
every bit of information
is a potential double-edged sword.
You don't know the
outcome of your research
or how it might later be used.
Ammonium nitrate is both a
fertilizer and an explosive.
So the real question is
how do we keep increasing our knowledge
and control of the natural world
without destroying ourselves
and everything else on
this planet in the process?
