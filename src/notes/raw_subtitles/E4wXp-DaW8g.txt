I
 hate
 calling
 things
 bubbles,
 but
 I


think
 we're
 in
 a
 period
 of
 extreme


euphoria
 where
 you
 read
 and
 speak
 to


investors
 and
 they
 say
 that
 the
 numbers


don't
 matter
 and
 the
 financial


statements
 no
 longer
 matter
 because
 this


is
 changing
 the
 world.
 I
 say,
 well,
 I've


seen
 this
 before.
 You
 know,
 I
 saw
 that


Nortell
 was
 changing
 the
 world
 and


Lucent
 and
 Cisco
 and
 360
 networks.
 They


were
 building
 out
 the
 infrastructure
 of


the
 internet
 that
 we're
 using
 today.


But
 those
 companies
 don't
 exist
 anymore.


>> Anthony
 Schilapati
 is
 a
 forensic


accountant
 who
 saw
 what
 others
 missed,


predicting
 the
 collapse
 of
 both
 Valiant


Pharmaceuticals
 and
 Nortell
 long
 before


it
 happened.
 He
 spent
 decades
 reading


what
 companies
 don't
 want
 you
 to
 see,


the
 footnotes.
 Now
 he's
 spotting


familiar
 warning
 signs
 in
 today's
 AI


boom.


>> What
 are
 the
 red
 flags
 you
 look
 for?


It's
 not
 red
 flags.
 We
 call
 them


flammable
 items.
 So,
 it's
 a
 three-stage


process.
 The
 first
 stage
 is


>> This
 episode
 of
 the
 knowledge
 project
 is


forformational
 purposes
 only.
 The
 views


and
 opinions
 expressed
 by
 Shane
 Parish


or
 our
 guests
 are
 solely
 their
 own.


Nothing
 in
 this
 conversation
 should
 be


considered
 investment
 advice,
 financial


guidance,
 or
 recommendation
 to
 buy
 or


sell
 any
 security.
 Always
 do
 your
 own


due
 diligence,
 or
 consult
 with
 a


qualified
 financial
 adviser
 before


making
 investment
 decisions.
 It's
 time


to
 listen
 and
 learn.


>> I
 want
 to
 start
 with
 how
 you
 got
 into


forensic
 accounting.


>> I
 was
 an
 accountant
 and
 I
 was
 working
 at


Arthur
 Anderson
 doing
 the
 normal
 audit


sort
 of
 preparatory
 work
 and
 I
 uh
 found


it
 unfulfilling
 uh
 because
 the
 work
 I


would
 do
 I
 would
 find
 interesting
 or


concerns
 with
 the
 accounting
 or


otherwise
 and
 the
 clients
 it
 didn't
 end


up
 ending
 anywhere.
 So,
 uh,
 what
 ended


up
 happening
 was
 the
 there
 was
 some
 due


diligence
 work
 to
 do
 where
 we
 could
 do


actually
 look
 at
 transactions,
 companies


calling
 us
 to
 say,
 you
 know,
 we
 want
 to


spin
 out
 this
 business
 or
 we
 want
 to


make
 this
 acquisition.
 And
 then
 I
 asked,


put
 my
 hand
 up,
 said,
 listen,
 can
 I
 do


that
 sort
 of
 work?
 And
 then
 I
 started


doing
 it
 and
 I
 loved
 it.
 I
 saw
 some
 huge


fulfillment.
 And
 then
 it's
 all
 about


people
 you
 meet.
 I
 met
 a
 a
 gentleman


named
 Al
 Rosen
 and
 he
 was
 head
 of


accounting
 at
 York
 University
 and
 he
 was


a
 forensic
 accountant.
 He
 had
 his
 own


practice.
 He
 taught
 taught
 us
 to
 pass


the
 the
 the
 Yuthi
 at
 the
 the
 exam
 or
 the


CPA
 exam
 at
 the
 time
 and
 um
 I
 said
 you


know
 I'd
 like
 to
 work
 with
 you
 and
 he


said
 well
 you
 get
 your
 CA
 work
 done
 and


then
 we'll
 think
 about
 it.
 And
 uh
 that's


what
 I
 did.
 And
 so
 then
 I
 toutelaged


under
 him
 for
 some
 four
 years.
 And
 uh


that
 that
 really
 uh
 made
 it
 happen.


>> You
 weren't
 on
 the
 Enron
 file,
 were
 you?


>> I
 was
 not
 on
 the
 Enron
 file.
 I
 left


Arthur
 Anderson
 in
 1997.
 Couldn't
 even


spell
 Enron
 at
 the
 time.
 And
 uh
 it's


it's
 a
 very
 sad
 thing
 what
 happened.


>> What
 did
 happen
 at
 Enron?


>> They
 essentially
 had
 a
 number
 of


offbalance
 sheet
 exposures.
 So
 they


would
 enter
 into
 derivative
 type


contracts
 where
 that
 were
 tied
 to
 an


energy
 price
 for
 example
 or
 even
 the


company's
 own
 stock
 price
 and
 it'd
 be


like
 this
 debt
 only
 comes
 due
 if
 the


stock
 price
 falls
 to
 X.
 This
 debt
 only


comes
 due
 or
 this
 derivative
 transaction


we'd
 entered
 into
 and
 Ron
 was
 an
 energy


trader.
 um
 you
 know
 so
 if
 the
 price
 of


electricity
 in
 kilowatt
 hours
 rises
 to
 a


certain
 amount
 well
 then
 there
 this
 debt


is
 no
 longer
 due.
 If
 it
 falls
 to
 this


level
 then
 they're
 they
 have
 to
 pay
 uh


some
 counterparty
 and
 so
 those
 were


those
 those
 risks
 were
 essentially


offbalance
 sheet.
 So
 those
 were
 not


sitting
 on
 the
 company's
 liabilities.


They
 were
 all
 contingent
 and
 at
 the
 time


the
 accounting
 rules
 were
 such
 that
 the


this
 these
 numbers
 were
 not
 included
 on


the
 liabilities.
 They
 were
 just
 in
 the


notes.
 And
 so
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 so
 people


weren't
 paying
 attention
 because
 nobody


read
 that
 reads
 the
 notes.
 And
 so
 then


all
 of
 a
 sudden
 things
 started
 to


happen.
 There
 was
 a
 change
 and
 movement


in
 commodity
 prices.
 Okay,
 this
 is
 now


we're
 dealing
 with
 the
 dot.
 There
 was
 a


lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 changes
 that
 happened
 in


the
 economy.
 We
 we
 had
 a
 we
 had
 a
 a
 uh
 a


recession
 in
 the
 early
 2000s,
 right?
 And


so
 that
 led
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 movements
 in


commodity
 prices
 that
 triggered
 the


derivatives.
 Surprise,
 surprise,
 they


can't
 make
 the
 payments.
 It's
 done.


>> And
 they
 weren't
 required
 to
 reserve
 or


put
 away
 in
 reserves
 any
 amount
 of


>> well,
 if
 it
 wasn't
 on
 the
 balance
 sheet,


then
 investors
 and
 wouldn't
 wouldn't


have
 noticed
 that
 that
 there
 was
 not


enough
 assets
 per
 perhaps
 to
 cover.
 and


and
 why
 the
 implication
 to
 Arthur


Anderson
 which
 I
 think
 is
 important
 and


then
 it's
 near
 and
 dear
 to
 my
 heart
 is


you
 know
 the
 auditors
 at
 Arthur
 Anderson


they're
 working
 on
 the
 file
 they
 ended


up
 signing
 off
 on
 all
 these
 things
 well


when
 essentially
 the
 proverbial
 hit
 the


fan
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 they
 were
 asking


questions
 and
 the
 regulator
 asked
 for


the
 working
 papers
 of
 the
 auditor
 that


the
 papers
 of
 which
 they
 would
 support


the
 audit
 work
 and
 they
 knew
 perhaps


that
 they
 didn't
 do
 enough
 work
 so
 they


shredded
 the
 documents.
 So
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 they
 became
 guilty
 because
 of


their
 actions


>> and
 so
 it
 was
 found
 in
 the
 courts
 um


upon
 appeal
 that
 uh
 Arthur
 Anderson
 was


not
 guilty
 but
 that
 was
 way
 after
 the


fact
 because
 Arthur
 Anderson
 was
 already


was
 brought
 to
 its
 knees
 and
 it
 was


over.
 became
 a
 scapegoat
 for
 everything


wrong
 with
 uh
 with
 with
 accounting
 at


the
 time
 and
 uh
 look
 change
 needed
 to


happen.
 Arthur
 Anderson
 was
 around
 the


world
 all
 the
 partners
 were
 folded
 into


the
 other
 firms.


>> What
 are
 the
 limitations
 on
 audits?


>> The
 limitations?


>> Yeah.
 Hey,
 the
 limitations
 are
 you're


hired
 to
 be
 a
 independent
 to
 give
 your


independent
 opinion
 and
 attest
 that
 the


financial
 statements
 present
 fairly
 in


all
 material
 respects
 in
 accordance
 with


some
 set
 of
 accounting
 standards
 and/or


standards
 that's
 associated
 with
 a


contract
 for
 example.
 And
 the
 challenge


is
 time
 because
 you
 have
 to
 do
 this


quickly,
 pressures
 on
 costs
 and


essentially
 think
 about
 it
 this
 way.


It's
 like
 I
 tell
 you,
 look,
 I
 I
 just


prepared
 my
 report
 card.
 I
 got
 an
 A.
 I


now
 hand
 it
 to
 you
 and
 say,
 look,
 it's


an
 A.
 And
 if
 you
 say
 that
 it's
 an
 A,


I'll
 pay
 you
 X
 amount
 of
 money.
 So,
 look


at
 your
 situation.
 You
 come
 back
 and


say,
 well,
 it's
 actually
 not
 an
 A.
 It's


kind
 of
 a
 B+.


Uh,
 how
 much
 am
 I
 paying
 you
 again?


>> Yeah.


>> What
 do
 you
 mean
 it's
 a
 B+?
 Do
 you
 think


that
 question
 that
 the
 way
 I
 answered


that
 question
 couldn't
 have
 been
 this


way
 or
 the
 other
 way
 you
 know
 and
 this


is
 it
 ties
 into
 so
 many
 things
 you
 know


AI
 and
 so
 forth
 business
 is
 judgment


people
 run
 companies
 they
 don't
 run


themselves
 the
 decisions
 associated
 with


a
 business
 transaction
 end
 up
 being


reflected
 on
 those
 financial
 statements


but
 when
 the
 group
 that's
 making
 the


decision
 in
 the
 business
 to
 do
 something


well
 then
 they
 come
 back
 to
 the
 office


and
 show
 up
 in
 the
 in
 the
 accounting


department
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 we
 just
 did


this.
 You
 know,
 can
 you
 guys
 figure
 out


how
 to
 account
 for
 it?"
 And
 all
 of a


sudden,
 the
 accountants
 are
 like, "God,


what
 do
 I
 do
 now?
 How
 do
 I
 do
 this?"


Because
 then
 they
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 when


you
 do
 this,
 I
 want
 it
 presented
 as
 as,


you
 know,
 as
 bright
 as
 possible
 so
 that


our
 investors
 and
 all
 our
 stakeholders


are
 really
 excited
 by
 the
 results
 like


don't
 present
 it
 badly.


>> You
 you
 said
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't
 read


the
 footnotes
 or
 the
 financial


statements.
 Is
 that
 changing
 in
 a
 world


of
 AI
 where
 you
 can
 sort
 of
 like


download
 the
 financial
 statement,
 pop
 it


into
 AI
 and
 say,
 "What
 do
 I
 need
 to


know?"


>> I
 think
 it's
 actually
 exacerbating
 the


situation.


>> Oh,
 spend
 a
 few
 beats
 on
 that


>> because
 now
 read
 the
 financial


statements,
 Anthony.
 I
 just
 put
 it
 into


AI.
 I
 asked
 Chat
 GPT
 to
 tell
 me,
 "What


about
 this?
 Look
 for
 that.
 Look
 for


that."
 And
 there's
 there's
 all
 the


instances
 of
 those
 things.
 and
 then
 I


just
 read
 it
 and
 it's
 all
 there.
 Well,


did
 the
 AI
 miss
 it?
 Did
 the
 AI


understand
 the
 linkages
 between
 each
 of


those
 sightings?
 If
 I'm
 if
 I'm
 looking


at,
 for
 example,
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 a


company
 recently
 and
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 it


was
 capitalizing
 costs.
 Okay,
 this
 is
 a


REIT.
 And
 if
 it
 capitalizes
 cost
 versus


putting
 them
 through
 the
 income


statement,
 if
 it
 goes
 through
 the
 income


statement,
 it
 makes
 their
 operating


earnings
 look
 poor,
 lower,
 and
 their
 net


EPS
 ultimately.
 But
 if
 they
 put
 it
 on


the
 balance
 sheet,
 well,
 you
 know,


that's
 an
 investment
 in
 the
 future
 and


everything
 looks
 okay,
 right?
 And
 so


there's
 a
 gray
 area.
 Was
 it
 an
 operating


expense
 or
 was
 it
 a
 capital
 item?
 And
 so


I
 was
 first
 thing
 I
 looked
 for
 was


capitalized
 interest.
 And
 so
 it
 gave
 me


all
 the
 quotes
 and
 then
 capitalized


costs
 and
 it
 gave
 me
 all
 the
 quotes.
 So


then
 you
 think
 that
 that's
 enough,
 but


you
 have
 to
 then
 and
 I
 and
 I
 was
 showing


one
 of
 my
 guys
 this.
 I
 said,
 "So
 then


let's
 go
 to
 the
 income.
 Let's
 actually


pull
 up
 the
 statements
 where
 it
 told
 us


to
 go
 because
 AI
 made
 it
 faster.
 I
 now


no
 longer
 needed
 to
 flip
 the
 300
 pages,


but
 it
 it
 gave
 me
 where
 to
 go.
 So
 now
 I


went
 there
 and
 now
 I
 could
 say
 well
 that


means
 if
 that
 is
 what's
 happened
 then
 we


need
 to
 look
 at
 this
 other
 note
 to
 see


what
 you
 know
 the
 implications
 of
 that


and
 then
 we
 got
 to
 look
 at
 the
 cash
 flow


statement
 to
 see
 how
 it's
 actually


impacting
 what
 ends
 up
 being
 reported
 as


as
 cash
 flow
 and
 so
 those
 linkages
 come


it
 the
 AI
 makes
 me
 get
 to
 the
 answer


perhaps
 more
 quickly
 but
 it's
 my
 if
 I


don't
 already
 know
 where
 I
 want
 to
 go


then
 AI
 just
 gives
 me
 information,
 but


that
 information
 doesn't
 help
 my


decision
 if
 I
 didn't
 start
 with
 where
 I


want
 to
 get
 to.


>> And
 it
 sounds
 like
 that
 information


doesn't
 help
 your
 decision
 if
 you
 don't


know
 the
 second,
 third,
 fourth
 order


consequence.


>> 100%.
 This
 is
 I
 love
 it.
 If
 that's
 where


investors
 go
 and
 that's
 where
 they're


going,
 everything
 is
 going
 to
 AI.
 The


the
 bottom
 level
 of
 being
 an
 analyst,


the
 junior
 analyst
 is
 is
 going
 to
 be


replaced
 by
 an
 AI.
 the
 one
 that
 said,


"Find
 me
 all
 the
 references
 of,
 you


know,
 where
 the
 company
 capitalized


costs."
 That
 the
 AI
 can
 do.
 I
 get
 it.


But
 you
 need
 someone
 with
 experience
 to


know
 what
 which
 of
 those
 references


matter
 and
 to
 what
 that
 means
 to
 the


business.


And
 this
 brings
 about
 a
 number
 of


challenges
 because
 well
 if
 that
 junior


person
 doesn't
 learn


doesn't
 get
 on
 the
 in
 on
 the
 ground


floor
 they'll
 never
 learn
 to
 be
 able
 to


make
 all
 those
 connections


>> and
 the
 only
 way
 to
 learn
 is
 sort
 of


like
 being
 in
 the
 weeds
 and
 not
 being
 in


a


>> Yes.
 In
 fact,
 it
 ties
 to
 so
 many
 things.


I
 I
 with
 my
 own
 children
 I've
 seen


growing
 up
 when
 we
 went
 to
 school
 and
 we


were
 in
 elementary
 school,
 we
 would
 be,


you
 know,
 we'd
 have
 to
 do
 the
 math


tables
 and
 and
 recite
 them.


>> Yeah.
 2
 *
 2
 is
 four
 and
 so
 on.
 I


remember
 I
 was
 struggled
 with
 my
 with
 my


nine
 times
 table
 and
 then
 my
 12
 times


table
 and
 so
 I
 had
 to
 memorize
 them
 and


get
 them
 going.
 But
 then
 my
 children


came
 along
 and
 they
 were
 using
 a


calculator
 and
 apparently
 that
 was
 okay.


I
 went
 bananas.
 I
 said,
 "You're
 not


going
 to
 use
 the
 calculator.
 You
 need
 to


learn
 it
 without
 the
 calculator
 and
 then


you
 can
 use
 the
 calculator,
 which
 is
 the


same
 with
 AI.
 You
 need
 to
 understand
 how


the
 financial
 statements
 are
 prepared,


understand
 the
 linkages,
 develop
 mental


models
 so
 that
 when
 the
 AI
 gives
 you


information,
 you
 can
 you
 can
 digest
 it


and
 make
 decisions.
 Reminds
 me
 of
 this


funny
 story.
 When
 I
 started
 university,


uh,
 I
 ended
 up
 in
 first
 year
 calculus


and
 for
 whatever
 reason,
 the
 professor


who
 was
 supposed
 to
 teach
 that
 class


couldn't
 teach
 it.
 So,
 the
 dean
 of
 the


math
 department
 took
 over.
 And
 on
 the


first
 class,
 in
 the
 first
 like
 minute,


he
 said,
 "There'll
 be
 no
 calculators
 in


this
 class."
 Oh,


>> nobody
 of
 course
 listened
 to
 him
 cuz


graphing
 calculator,
 you're
 like,
 "Oh
 my


god,
 this
 makes
 my
 life
 so
 much
 easier."


would
 show
 up
 to
 the
 final
 exam
 which
 is


like
 I
 think
 80%
 of
 your
 final
 mark.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 on
 the
 front
 page
 it's
 no


calculators
 and
 he
 did
 not
 grade
 that
 on


a
 curve
 and
 it
 was
 not
 pretty
 for
 most


students.


>> I
 taught
 at
 university
 for
 about
 uh
 14


years
 at
 York
 and
 uh
 truly
 one
 of
 a
 very


fulfilling
 time
 uh
 in
 my
 life
 and
 uh
 I


still
 love
 doing
 guest
 lectures.
 I


remember
 I
 I
 I
 would
 always
 start
 the,


you
 know,
 I
 would
 go
 over
 the
 outline


and
 I
 and
 I
 would
 tell
 the
 students,
 I


said,
 "So,
 assignments
 are
 due
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 class.


>> If
 they're
 handed
 in
 after
 the
 8:30


start
 time,
 it's
 a
 zero.
 It's
 a
 zero."


And
 invariably


at
 some
 whether
 it
 was
 the
 first
 and


usually
 the
 first
 or
 second
 assignment,


somebody
 would
 show
 up
 and
 hand
 it
 in


late
 and
 I
 would
 say
 it's
 a
 zero.


>> Yeah.
 and
 they
 would
 whine
 and
 say
 it's


how
 can
 you
 do
 that
 and
 you're
 so


draconian
 and
 I
 say
 well
 you
 think
 in


the
 real
 world
 when
 an
 RFP
 is
 required


and
 you've
 signed
 with
 the
 contract
 with


a
 client
 that
 they
 demand
 the
 report
 by


9:00
 a.m.
 on
 Monday
 and
 you
 show
 up
 at


9:05.
 How's
 that
 look?


And
 somehow
 it's
 okay.
 So,
 it
 wasn't


okay
 in
 my
 class.
 And
 and
 ultimately,
 I


think
 you
 you
 build
 respect
 because


people
 see
 that
 there's
 a
 rule
 and
 it's


followed
 and
 then
 people
 have
 respect


for
 the
 rule.


>> There's
 this
 sort
 of
 like
 weird


dichotomy
 I
 think
 with
 students
 right


now.
 And
 dichotomy
 is
 probably
 not
 the


right
 word.
 There's
 this
 weird


path
 where
 students
 are
 coming
 out
 and


they're
 more
 powerful
 and
 capable
 than


ever
 because
 they
 use
 AI
 by
 default


>> and
 so
 they
 can
 get
 more
 output
 than


somebody
 who's
 maybe
 been
 in
 their


career
 15
 20
 years
 and
 I
 I
 use
 my


14year-old
 as
 an
 example.
 You
 know,
 in
 a


world
 where
 he
 never
 had
 to
 show
 up
 to


work,
 he's
 a
 mid-level
 employee
 at
 most


companies
 based
 on
 output.
 If
 you
 never


saw
 him,
 he
 can
 give
 you
 the
 the
 exact


same
 output
 that
 a
 mid-level
 employee
 is


going
 to
 give
 you
 if
 everything
 goes


right.
 But
 the
 minute
 something
 goes


wrong,
 he
 doesn't
 quite
 understand
 all


the
 nuances
 and
 all
 the
 and
 AI
 the
 I


guess
 the
 race
 for
 him
 is
 like
 will
 AI


catch
 up
 quicker,
 you
 know,
 because
 he


uses
 AI
 by
 default.
 And
 I
 sort
 of
 think


about
 this
 as
 like
 making
 a
 recipe,


right?
 Like
 if
 I
 pull
 out
 a
 cookbook
 and


I
 make
 a
 recipe
 and
 I
 do
 everything


perfectly,
 you
 wouldn't
 be
 able
 to
 tell


the
 difference
 between
 me
 and
 the
 chef.


Like
 the
 food,
 maybe
 it's
 not
 plated
 as


well,
 but
 it's
 going
 to
 taste
 great.


It's
 going
 to
 taste
 the
 same.
 You'd
 be


like,
 "This
 is
 amazing."
 But
 if


something
 goes
 wrong,
 if
 the
 oven's
 too


hot,
 if
 I
 don't
 stir
 enough,
 I
 don't
 put


enough
 salt
 in.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 it


didn't
 go
 right.
 But
 the
 minute
 a
 chef,


the
 chef
 who
 created
 that
 recipe,
 who's


got
 all
 the
 experience,
 who
 did
 the,
 you


know,
 who's
 made
 it
 hundreds
 of
 times,


they
 taste
 it,
 they're
 like,
 "Oh,
 your


oven
 said
 375,
 but
 it's
 actually
 350.


You
 stirred
 this
 too
 much.
 You
 let
 this


boil.
 You
 They
 instantly
 know
 what
 went


wrong."
 Yes.
 And
 I
 wonder
 if
 in
 a
 world


of
 AI,
 that's
 the
 nuance.
 And
 I
 I
 was


talking
 to
 Steve
 Schwarzmann
 about
 this


in
 a
 different
 context.
 But
 he
 basically


said,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 analysts


coming
 up,
 they
 know
 the
 numbers,
 but


they
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 numbers
 mean.


>> Correct.
 Experience
 teaches
 you


judgment.
 And
 and
 you
 talk
 about
 this
 in


your
 book.
 It's
 all
 about
 the
 mental


models.
 I
 I I
 believe
 that
 strongly.
 The


experience
 teaches
 you
 what
 the
 numbers


mean
 as
 we've
 spoken
 about.
 And
 when
 you


have
 experience,
 you
 say,
 "I've
 seen


that
 before."


>> And
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 things
 I
 see
 happening


today
 link
 back
 to
 things
 I've
 seen
 when


I
 started
 my
 career
 over
 the
 last
 30


years.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 something
 that


the
 AI
 can't
 quite
 do
 unless
 you
 tell
 it


where
 to
 look
 because
 it
 doesn't
 know


the
 link
 that
 I'm
 thinking
 about,
 right?


But
 if
 I
 if
 I
 can
 make
 the
 initial


stage,
 it
 can
 help
 me
 get
 there
 quicker


and
 more
 accurately.
 But
 if
 I
 don't
 if
 I


don't
 already
 have
 a
 model
 of
 what
 I'm


looking
 for,
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 get


there.


>> What
 are
 you
 seeing
 today?


>> We're
 talking
 now
 equity
 markets.
 Is


that


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 we're
 in
 uh
 what
 seems
 to


be,
 you
 know,
 and
 I
 I
 hate
 calling


things
 bubbles,
 but
 I
 think
 we're
 in
 a


period
 of
 extreme
 uh
 euphoria
 where
 the


numbers,
 the
 fundamentals,
 and


fundamentals
 is
 thrown
 around
 in
 the


investment
 industry
 like
 the
 the
 word


love
 is
 thrown
 around
 among
 humans.
 You


know,
 the
 fundamentals,
 well,
 someone


looks
 at
 the
 chart
 and
 sees
 that,
 you


know,
 it
 did
 a
 double
 bottom.
 Well,


that's
 the
 fundamentals.
 And
 someone


else
 says,
 you
 know,
 that
 they're


looking
 at
 the
 RSI
 or
 some
 other
 things


or
 someone
 else
 says
 they're
 just


looking
 at
 cash
 flow
 or
 someone's


looking
 at
 the
 multiple
 related
 to


earnings.
 And
 those
 are
 the


fundamentals.
 Well,
 at
 the,
 you
 know,


historically,
 and
 if
 we
 follow
 what
 what


Buffett
 says,
 the
 company
 is
 the
 present


value
 of
 its
 future
 cash
 flows.
 And
 how


do
 you
 develop
 those
 cash
 flows?
 Well,


you
 need
 to
 do
 a
 forecast
 on
 what
 it's


what
 what
 it's
 going
 to
 drive
 the


business.
 And
 so,
 that's
 what
 I
 think


the
 fundamentals
 are.
 And
 so
 when
 a


company
 today
 is
 not
 generating
 much
 in


free
 cash
 impact
 negative
 and
 yet
 the


market
 wants
 to
 trade
 it
 at
 a
 multiple


of
 its
 revenues


well
 then
 the
 company's
 valuations
 is


extracted
 from
 its
 current
 fundamentals


and
 trading
 based
 on
 some
 future


expectations.
 I've
 been
 asked
 you
 know


if
 you
 could
 have
 anything
 what
 would
 it


be?
 and
 I'd
 say
 tomorrow's
 newspaper


because
 then
 I'd
 know
 what
 was
 going
 to


happen
 and
 I
 would
 be
 able
 to
 invest
 on


that.
 And
 so
 we're
 all
 trying
 to
 do
 the


most
 the
 impossible
 figure
 out
 what's


going
 to
 happen
 tomorrow.
 And
 all
 I
 know


is
 I've
 seen
 that
 when
 you
 read
 and


speak
 to
 investors
 and
 they
 say
 that
 the


numbers
 don't
 matter
 and
 the
 financial


statements
 no
 longer
 matter
 because
 this


is
 changing
 the
 world.
 I
 say,
 "Well,


I've
 seen
 this
 before."
 You
 know,
 I
 saw


that
 Nortell
 was
 changing
 the
 world
 and


Lucent
 and
 Cisco
 and
 360
 networks.
 They


were
 building
 out
 the
 infrastructure
 of


the
 internet
 that
 we're
 using
 today.


But
 those
 companies
 don't
 exist
 anymore.


They
 built
 what
 they
 built
 and
 that


still
 exists,
 but
 they
 no
 longer
 exist.


Either
 bankrupt
 or
 folded
 into
 other


companies.
 Cisco
 still
 exists
 today,
 but


has
 never
 traded
 at
 it
 at
 its
 historical


uh
 valuation.
 And
 yet,
 it's
 a
 it's
 it's


a
 multiples
 bigger
 than
 it
 was
 back
 then


and
 by
 earnings
 and
 by
 revenue.


>> If
 you're
 a
 founder,
 you
 know,
 naming


your
 startup
 takes
 forever.
 You
 finally


land
 on
 the
 perfect
 name
 only
 to
 find


out
 that
 Peter
 from
 Delaware
 got
 to
 the


first.
 So,
 you're
 stuck
 with
 two
 bad


options.
 Pay
 up
 and
 fund
 Peter's


retirement
 or
 tack
 on
 random
 words
 until


your
 domain
 looks
 like
 a
 Wi-Fi
 password.


But
 after
 all
 the
 time
 and
 money
 spent


on
 naming,
 you
 don't
 want
 that.
 And


thanks
 to
 tech
 domains,
 you
 don't
 have


to.

 you

 you


actually

I
 guess
 what
 you're
 saying
 is
 the
 same


is
 we
 know
 this
 is
 the
 future,
 but
 it's


also
 the
 same
 in
 that
 we
 don't
 know
 who


the
 winners
 are
 going
 to
 be.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 and
 I
 think
 right
 now


the
 reason
 why
 I
 think
 we're
 in
 a
 in
 a


very
 high-risisk
 situation
 is
 because


the
 cost
 of
 the
 risk
 is
 priced
 very
 low


and
 that's
 when
 the
 risk
 is
 highest.
 And


so
 how
 do
 we
 look
 at
 that?
 When
 you
 look


at
 the
 uh
 the
 high
 yield
 bond
 spread,


the
 spread
 between
 the
 10-year
 bond
 and


the
 high
 yield
 bond
 in
 the
 US,
 okay,


that's
 the
 non-investment
 grade
 bonds.


Well,
 that's
 the
 tightest,
 near
 the


tightest
 it's
 ever
 been,


>> which
 means
 that
 investors
 are
 willing


to
 lend
 money
 to
 non-investment
 grade


companies
 at
 a
 spread
 over
 what
 a


government
 bond
 is
 at
 a
 rate,
 which
 is


the
 tightest
 it's
 been
 practically
 in


history.
 So
 there's
 no
 risk
 priced
 into


the
 bond
 market.
 And
 then
 in
 the
 equity


markets,
 we
 use
 VIX,
 which
 is
 a
 measure


of
 volatility
 of
 the
 of
 the
 S&P
 500.
 And


that
 is
 trading
 at
 a
 benign
 level.
 It's


not
 the
 lowest
 it's
 ever
 been,
 but
 it's


at
 a
 benign
 level.
 So
 in
 essence,
 what


investors
 are
 saying
 is
 there's
 no
 risk.


Everything's
 fine.
 Isn't
 that
 the


age-old
 wisdom
 of
 like
 don't
 fight
 the


Fed,
 though?
 For
 sure.
 the
 future
 is
 is


pretty
 clear
 at least
 in
 the
 short
 term.


But
 the
 implications
 of
 that
 are
 we
 I I


don't
 proclaim
 to
 know
 but
 interest


rates
 are
 coming
 down.
 I
 mean
 all
 the


governments
 want
 interest
 rates
 down,


>> right?
 They
 they
 want
 interest
 rates


down
 because
 because
 debts
 have
 have


continued
 to
 balloon
 in
 a
 period
 which


has
 been
 relatively
 buoyant
 uh
 by


historical
 standards
 and
 interest
 rates


uh
 they
 perceive
 interest
 rates
 are


going to
 go
 down.
 That's
 going
 to
 keep


on
 the
 buoyancy.
 Well,
 the
 central
 bank


and
 if
 you
 followed
 Powell
 despite
 all


the
 pressures
 coming
 from
 Trump
 to
 cut


rates,
 I
 mean
 Powell
 is
 going
 to
 cut


rates
 because
 he's
 concerned
 about


either
 the
 employment
 situation,
 right,


or
 the
 economic
 situation
 more
 broadly


>> or
 political
 pressure.


>> There's
 supposed
 to
 be
 a
 separation.
 And


it
 seem,
 you're
 right,
 but
 it
 seems
 like


he's
 actually
 noticing
 that
 because
 the


now
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 we've
 seen
 some
 some


more
 strain
 in
 the
 in
 the
 employment


market.
 And
 that
 I
 think
 is
 what's


leaning
 him
 to
 believe,
 okay,
 now
 it's


time
 probably
 to
 start
 cutting
 rates.


>> What
 happens
 when
 we
 cut
 rates
 and


markets
 are
 at
 all-time
 highs?
 It
 could


become
 a
 situation
 of
 where
 you
 sell
 the


news
 because
 everybody
 was
 moving
 the


market
 up
 in
 anticipation
 of
 it


happening
 because
 the
 belief
 is
 as
 we


when
 we
 cut
 rates
 we
 provide
 more
 lowerc


cost
 capital
 to
 companies
 they
 put
 that


capital
 to
 work
 and
 it
 generates
 return.


Every
 company
 is
 only
 as
 good
 or
 as


stable
 or
 as
 strong
 as
 its
 customer


base.
 And
 if
 we're
 seeing
 that
 the


customer
 base
 of
 uh
 you
 know,
 let's
 call


it
 the
 average
 Joe,
 and
 I
 call
 that
 Joe


Sixpack.
 Uh
 he's
 a
 buddy
 of
 mine.
 We
 all


have
 a
 buddy,
 Joe
 Sixpack.
 And
 so
 if
 Joe


Sixpack
 is
 struggling,


then
 ultimately,
 how
 is
 everything
 going


to
 trickle
 down
 and
 create
 growth?


>> You
 know,
 I
 have
 a
 hard
 time
 reconciling


this,
 right?
 Because
 the
 the
 the


territory,
 the
 boots
 on
 the
 ground
 is
 a


lot
 of
 people
 are
 struggling.
 seems
 like


more
 people
 than
 at
 least
 in
 my
 adult


lifetime
 with
 the
 exception
 of
 maybe
 the


2008
 financial
 crisis.
 And
 we
 have


markets
 at
 all-time
 highs.


>> Yep.


>> And
 we
 have
 inflation,
 core
 inflation


actually
 going
 up
 and
 we
 also
 have


governments
 uh
 with
 high
 unemployment


pushing
 interest
 rates
 down.
 And
 we
 have


this
 this
 really
 I
 don't
 make
 macro


predictions,
 but
 we
 have
 this
 really


interesting
 setup.
 And
 then
 on
 top
 of


that,
 like
 just
 from
 my
 like
 how
 I
 sort


of
 approach
 things,
 you
 have
 the


greatest
 investor
 of
 all
 time
 who
 has


built
 up
 uh
 I
 don't


>> what's
 yeah
 400
 billion
 by
 now
 or
 350


billion.
 His
 largest
 cash
 holding
 as
 a


percentage
 of
 market
 cap
 I
 think
 ever.
 I


struggle
 to
 reconcile
 all
 of
 these


things
 into
 some
 coherent
 view
 of
 like


>> the
 the
 thing
 about
 the
 markets
 and


companies
 is
 they'll
 continue
 longer


than
 you
 and
 I
 will
 be
 alive.
 And
 so


when
 you're
 investing,
 it
 just
 depends


on
 your
 horizon.


And
 I
 think
 what's
 happening
 today
 is


investors
 have
 learned


and
 rightly
 so
 that
 every
 time
 the


market
 falls,
 it
 rallies
 back.


>> And
 I
 like
 the
 comment
 you
 made,
 Shane.


I'm
 not
 here
 to
 predict
 markets.
 Uh
 it's


a
 fool's
 game.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 know,
 you


know,
 I
 I
 wish
 I
 knew
 then
 I
 just
 buy


futures
 and
 make
 tons
 of
 money
 or
 short


them.
 But
 what
 instead
 I
 know
 is
 I'm


looking
 at
 the
 underlying
 companies
 and


except
 for
 some
 of
 the
 mag
 seven
 that


are
 growing
 to
 earnings,
 the
 smaller
 and


midcaps
 are
 not.
 When
 Walmart
 is
 telling


you
 that
 there's
 a
 problem
 with
 its


sales
 forecasts
 and
 Target
 is
 struggling


and
 Lululemon
 can't
 sell
 the
 same
 number


of
 pants
 and
 Starbucks
 is
 considering
 to


changing
 some
 of
 its
 pricing
 and
 some
 of


its
 its
 business
 model.
 you
 know,
 this


is
 Joe
 Sixpack
 and
 and
 Stevie
 Weinbox


that
 stepped
 up
 from
 Joe
 Sixback.
 You


have
 Stevie
 Weinbox
 in
 the
 middle.
 Um,


and
 I
 think
 they're
 the
 ones
 that
 are


struggling.
 And
 so
 it
 tells
 me
 that
 this


can
 continue
 and
 and
 markets
 can


continue
 going
 up
 for
 for
 any
 number
 of


amount
 of
 time
 because
 it's
 a
 function


of
 how
 much
 liquidity
 is
 in
 the
 market


as
 well.
 People
 have
 are
 if
 investors


have
 lots
 of
 cash,
 they'll
 continue
 to


invest.
 the
 people
 that
 you're
 seeing


that
 are
 making
 the
 most
 money
 today
 um


are
 not
 those
 that
 historically
 necess


in
 general
 I'm
 speaking
 the
 ones
 that


you
 hear
 about
 that
 have
 made
 money


historically
 we
 talk
 Ray
 Dalio
 we
 talk


about
 you
 mentioned
 of
 course
 Warren


Buffett
 and
 there
 was
 a
 there's
 a
 quote


that
 was
 that
 I
 that
 I
 learned
 uh
 over


time
 and
 it
 says
 during
 raging
 bull


markets
 knowledge
 is
 superfluous
 and


experience
 is
 a
 handicap


Because


if
 you
 have
 the
 the
 benefit
 of
 knowing


what
 happened
 in
 all
 the
 other
 blowups,


you
 know
 how
 painful
 it
 could
 be.
 But
 if


you've
 never
 experienced
 it
 and
 every


time
 something
 went
 wrong,
 it
 just


rallied
 back
 like
 nothing
 happened,


well,
 you
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 continue.


>> I
 guess
 the
 argument
 against
 that
 is


this
 time
 it's
 different,
 which
 is
 what


we
 always


>> which
 is
 the
 most
 dangerous
 words
 in
 in


life
 and
 in
 finance.
 one
 day
 want
 to


write
 a
 book
 that's
 that
 that
 marries


finance
 with
 life
 because
 it's
 it's it's


it's
 one
 and
 the
 same.


>> I
 remember
 this
 interview
 Alish


Schroeder
 did
 and
 she
 hasn't
 done
 many


interviews
 and
 one
 of
 the
 most


illuminating
 things
 that
 I
 remember
 from


that
 interview
 is
 that
 Buffett
 when
 he


was
 looking
 at
 patterns
 he
 wasn't
 trying


to
 identify
 what's
 different
 this
 time


he's
 trying
 to
 focus
 on
 what's
 the
 same.


>> Yes.


>> Talk
 to
 me
 about
 that.
 And
 so
 what
 I
 see


is
 the
 same.
 We
 actually
 put,
 you
 know,


I
 I
 transitioned
 the
 the
 forensic


accounting
 knowledge
 and
 and
 skill
 set


into
 what
 is
 today
 Veritas.
 And
 so


that's
 an
 independent
 equity
 research


firm
 and
 then
 later
 into
 also
 an
 asset


management
 arm.
 And
 all
 of
 that
 started


because
 we
 wrote
 a
 cell
 report
 on


Nortell
 in
 in
 2000.
 And
 people
 thought


we
 were
 crazy.
 And
 you
 know,
 at
 the
 time


I
 was
 29
 years
 old.
 So,
 I
 didn't
 realize


what
 I
 was
 actually
 doing.
 It's
 amazing


when
 we're
 young.
 But


>> you
 didn't
 realize
 the
 impact
 of
 what


you
 were
 doing.


>> I
 didn't
 like
 where


>> you
 knew
 the
 accounting.


>> I
 knew
 what
 I
 was
 looking
 at,
 but
 didn't


realize
 that
 if
 you
 dropped
 said
 pebble


into
 the
 water,
 what
 happens?
 And
 then


when
 John
 Roth
 gets
 quoted
 in
 the


newspaper
 that
 we're
 hurting
 his
 ability


to
 raise
 capital
 and
 clients
 are


cancelling
 and
 you
 know
 employees
 are


contacting
 us
 upset
 because
 of
 the


things
 we're
 saying
 and
 it's
 like
 I


didn't
 mean
 to
 hurt
 anybody.
 I'm
 just


saying
 the
 truth
 hence
 the
 name
 Veritas.


So
 let's
 link
 to
 what
 I
 think
 some
 of


the
 the
 the
 linkages
 from
 the
 past.
 So


at
 the
 time
 you
 had
 Nortell
 and
 you
 had


Cisco
 and
 you
 had
 Lucent
 and
 they
 were


building
 out
 various
 components
 parts
 of


the
 internet
 and
 what
 they
 would
 do
 was


they
 needed
 customers.
 Well
 the


customers
 needed
 to
 raise
 money
 cuz
 if


you're
 going
 to
 build
 infrastructure


you're
 not
 going
 to
 generate
 cash
 flow


for
 some
 time.
 So
 they
 would
 raise
 money


from
 equity
 holders
 and
 eventually
 get


some
 debt
 but
 the
 powers
 that
 be
 at


Lucent
 and
 Nortell
 would
 also
 offer


them.
 So
 they
 would
 say
 buy
 this
 $10


million
 worth
 of
 product
 and
 why
 don't


you
 pay
 me
 over
 some
 extended
 period
 of


time.
 Oh,
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 we'll
 give
 you


a
 line
 of
 credit
 so
 that
 you
 need
 10


million
 from
 us
 of
 of
 cable.
 Uh,
 but


we'll
 you
 can
 also
 you
 need
 to
 buy
 some


routers
 from
 Cisco.
 You
 know
 what?
 We'll


give
 you
 some
 line
 of
 credit
 so
 you


could
 do
 that
 because
 Nortto
 could


borrow
 money
 could
 could
 had
 a
 great


balance
 sheet
 could
 raise
 money


whatever.
 And
 so
 that's
 what
 was


happening.
 Well,
 ultimately
 when
 the


equity
 market
 started
 to
 wobble
 and


there
 was
 no
 one
 left
 to
 continue
 to


make
 sales
 to,
 right?
 Well,
 then
 now
 all


of
 a
 sudden
 Nortell
 didn't
 get
 paid
 on


its
 debts
 and
 the
 wheels
 came
 off
 and


then
 the
 360
 networks
 and
 JDS
 unif


mentioned
 they
 went
 by
 the
 wayside.
 And


so
 what
 ended
 up
 sort
 of
 now
 let's
 take


that
 and
 think
 about
 what's
 happening


today.
 So
 you
 have
 the
 likes
 of
 the


Nvidias
 of
 the
 world
 and
 let's
 say


Microsoft
 and
 you
 have
 Open
 AI
 and
 such


and
 Nvidia
 is
 investing
 in
 Open
 AI.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 Microsoft
 is
 an
 investor
 in
 Open
 AI.


Microsoft
 offers
 cloud
 services
 to
 Open


AI.
 So
 it's
 a
 customer.
 So
 OpenAI


becomes
 a
 customer
 of
 Microsoft.
 But


Microsoft
 gave
 it
 the
 money
 so
 that
 it


could
 actually
 pay
 it
 back.
 Nvidia


invests
 in
 OpenAI
 and
 Nvidia
 is
 a
 a
 a


supplier
 of
 chips
 to
 open
 AAI.
 So
 it's


all
 circular.
 What's
 going
 on
 here?


There's
 a
 new
 company
 that
 just
 went


public
 earlier
 this
 year,
 Cororeweave,


who
 is
 its
 largest
 customer.
 Coreeave


provides
 data
 transaction
 like
 analysis


of
 on
 chips,
 right?
 It's
 a
 data
 farm
 for


the
 large
 AI
 users
 like
 Microsoft.
 Its


largest
 customer
 is
 Microsoft.
 Microsoft


hasn't
 invested
 in
 it,
 but
 Nvidia


supplies
 pretty
 much
 all
 its
 chips.


Well,
 Nvidia
 is
 a
 large
 or
 is
 a


meaningful
 investor
 in
 Coreave.
 Corewave


goes
 public.


It's
 trying
 to
 close
 its
 its
 equity,
 its


financing.
 on
 the
 last
 moment,
 Nvidia


buys
 $250
 million
 worth
 of
 shares
 of


Cororeweave
 so
 that
 it
 could
 close
 the


deal.
 These
 are,
 you
 know,
 JP
 Morgan


gives
 them
 a
 loan
 so
 that
 they
 could


just
 before
 they
 go
 public
 and
 then
 they


go
 public
 and
 repay
 the
 loan
 to
 JP


Morgan
 who's
 the
 one
 of the
 lead


underwriters,
 JP
 Morgan.
 No
 one's
 doing


anything
 bad.
 No
 one's
 cheating.
 It's


just
 these
 are
 all
 the
 same
 type
 of


symptoms
 of
 things
 that
 were
 going
 on


way
 back
 some
 25
 years
 ago.
 All
 these


things
 don't
 mean
 anything.
 Nothing


means
 anything
 until
 it
 means
 something.


I
 say,
 you
 know,
 the
 things
 that
 we're


talking
 about
 right
 now,
 these
 little


things,
 if
 you
 will,
 you
 know,
 in
 the


time
 of
 2000s,
 just
 like
 we
 talked
 about


Enron,
 that
 didn't
 have
 the
 disclosure.


So,
 the
 key
 wrinkle
 to
 everything
 I


brought
 up,
 and
 that's
 why
 now
 I
 want
 to


take
 it
 to
 the
 accounting
 is
 the


financial
 statements
 of
 Nortell


>> didn't
 show
 that
 long-term
 loan
 as
 a


part
 of
 current
 assets.
 It
 showed
 it
 as


part
 of
 long-term
 assets.
 So,
 when
 the


simple
 calculation
 of
 current
 ratios,


they
 would
 only
 take
 well
 current


assets.
 And
 so,
 this
 long-term
 asset


that
 wouldn't
 show
 up
 as
 part
 of
 the


liquidity
 calculation.
 It
 also
 wouldn't


show
 up
 as
 part
 of
 operating
 cash
 flow.


And
 if
 it's
 not
 part
 of
 operating
 cash


flow,
 then
 operating
 cash
 flow
 looks


better.
 And
 no
 one
 would
 look
 at


long-term
 receivables.


>> And
 what
 they
 would
 because
 they're


taught
 in
 their
 CFA,
 how
 do
 you


calculate
 free
 cash
 flow?
 Operating
 cash


flow
 less
 capex.
 But
 this
 is
 the
 problem


with
 when
 you
 just
 create
 the
 ratio
 and


invest
 by
 ratio.
 The
 ratio
 needs
 to
 be


adapted
 to
 the
 company,
 the
 life
 cycle,


the
 industry,
 the
 business
 model.
 If
 the


company's
 selling
 things
 at
 a
 long-term


receiv
 over
 a
 period
 of
 extending
 beyond


one
 operating
 cycle,
 but
 it's
 part
 of


its
 normal
 operations,
 that
 should
 be


part
 of
 operating
 cash
 flow.
 And
 in


fact,
 after
 after
 Nortell,
 Fazby
 changed


the
 rules
 and
 then
 long-term
 receivables


became
 part
 of
 operating
 and
 short-ter


and
 and and
 current
 assets.
 And
 that's


something
 we
 wrote
 about.
 We
 said
 this


is
 wrong.
 You
 need
 to
 the
 free
 cash
 flow


is
 actually
 negative
 because
 this
 number


needs
 to
 be
 shown.
 So
 they're
 extremely


vulnerable
 to
 something
 going
 wrong
 if


the
 customer
 can't
 make
 payments.
 And


today,
 now
 let's
 look
 at
 the
 accounting


today.
 Nvidia
 would
 make
 that
 investment


in
 in
 core.
 It's
 such
 a
 small


meaningless
 dollar
 amount
 to
 the
 balance


sheet
 of
 Nvidia


>> that
 the
 num
 amount
 of
 disclosure
 is


irrelevant.
 It
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 related


party.
 Now,
 we
 only
 own
 5%
 so
 that's
 not


material
 to
 to
 Nvidia
 and
 the
 dollar


amount
 to
 Nvidia's
 total
 balance
 sheet


is
 also
 immaterial.
 So,
 it
 doesn't


matter.
 But
 if
 this
 is
 happening
 over


hundreds
 of
 transactions
 where
 it's


making
 investments
 like
 this
 in
 its
 own


customers,
 then
 what
 ends
 up
 happening


if
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 it
 runs
 out
 of
 the


ability
 to
 get
 cash
 or
 the
 customers
 end


up
 having
 problems
 selling
 services
 with


the
 chips
 that
 it
 buys,
 then
 kind
 of


things
 start
 to
 fall
 uh
 fall
 apart.

 Don't
 we


always
 invest
 in
 our
 customers
 as


businesses,
 though?
 You
 give
 them


payment
 terms,
 you
 allow
 them
 to
 extend,


you
 you
 know
 that's
 an
 investment
 in


your
 customers.


>> Again,
 it
 is
 it
 is
 fantastic
 business


savvy.
 You
 want
 if
 I'm
 trying
 to
 create


a
 new
 paradigm
 which
 is
 AI
 then
 I
 in


order
 to
 foster
 that
 paradigm
 I
 need
 to


invest
 in
 it


>> as
 a
 as
 the
 key
 player
 in
 it.
 And
 what


ends
 up
 happening
 if
 you
 see
 that
 my


name
 as
 a
 key
 investor
 and
 and
 a
 leader


in
 this
 industry
 is
 making
 an
 investment


in
 this
 company.
 Well,
 then
 what
 does


everybody
 else
 do?
 Warren
 Buffett
 tells


you
 he's
 buying
 something.
 What
 does


everybody
 do?
 They
 go
 buy
 it.
 Well,
 if


Nvidia
 is
 buying
 something,
 what
 do
 all


the
 private
 equity
 firms
 do
 looking


around?
 Well,
 that's
 a
 good
 one.


>> There's
 another
 one.
 It's
 on
 Corenser


Weave,
 like
 the
 AMD
 equivalent,
 which
 is


private
 now.
 So
 I
 would
 imagine
 they


would
 all


>> exactly


>> pile
 into
 that.


>> You
 got
 it.


>> Yeah.
 This
 Nortell
 report
 I
 want
 to
 come


back
 to
 this
 for
 a
 sec.
 So
 you
 dropped


this
 report
 and
 you
 happen
 to
 be


correct.


What
 responsibility


you
 know
 remember
 the
 Superman
 quote


with
 great
 power
 comes
 great


responsibility.


>> I
 tell
 you
 Spider-Man.


>> Spider-Man.
 Spider-Man.
 Yeah.


>> I
 love
 that
 quote.


>> And
 I
 wonder
 about
 these
 things
 like


when
 you're
 right
 it's
 great
 but
 what


about
 when
 you're
 wrong?
 And
 that's
 one


of
 the
 things
 uh
 you
 know
 we're


celebrating
 our
 25th
 anniversary
 this


year
 and
 uh
 I
 developed
 10
 uh
 rules


investing
 rules
 and
 they
 they
 relate
 to


life
 as
 well
 but
 uh
 one
 of
 them
 is
 being


negative
 sounds
 intelligent.


>> Being
 negative
 typically
 is
 looking
 at


facts.
 It's
 looking
 at
 numbers.
 It's


presenting
 them
 to
 you
 in
 a
 way
 that


says,
 "Wow,
 that
 seems
 really


compelling.
 If
 I
 want
 to
 sell
 you


something
 that
 is
 you
 know
 that
 so


that's
 the
 negative
 side.
 If
 I
 want
 to


sell
 you
 the
 positive
 side
 well
 then
 I


got
 to
 sell
 you
 the
 dream.
 AI
 is
 going


to
 change
 the
 world.
 People
 are
 going
 to


be
 no
 are
 no
 longer
 going
 to
 need
 to


work.
 We're
 it's
 going
 to
 replace
 jobs.


Margins
 are
 going
 to
 go
 higher.
 There's


going
 to
 create
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 going


to
 improve
 health
 care
 services.
 All
 the


the
 phenomenal
 things
 that
 could


potentially
 happen.
 And
 so
 you'd
 see


that
 and
 then
 you're
 willing
 to
 invest.


It's
 you're
 buying
 a
 dream.
 But
 if
 I


tell
 you,
 yeah,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 is


based
 on
 all
 these
 intricate


transactions
 where
 there's
 no
 disclosure


about
 you
 go,
 ah,
 that
 doesn't
 matter,


Anthony.
 Look,
 we're
 changing
 the
 world,


buddy.
 I
 like
 to
 say
 none
 of
 these


things
 matter
 until
 they
 matter.
 And


then
 when
 they
 matter,
 they
 matter
 a


lot.
 You
 know,
 with
 great
 power
 comes


great
 responsibility.
 You're
 right.
 This


should
 not
 be
 interpreted
 as
 I'm
 telling


that
 something's
 going
 to
 blow
 up.
 I'm


just
 saying
 that
 there
 are
 some


linkages,
 things
 we've
 seen
 in
 past


euphoric
 times.
 Things
 could
 continue


for
 any
 number
 of
 periods.
 I
 I
 don't


know.
 But
 we're
 getting
 to
 a
 point,
 as
 I


said
 earlier,
 where
 there's
 very
 little


cost
 to
 risk
 today.


>> What
 are
 the
 10
 investing
 rules?


>> Oh,
 now
 you're
 going
 to
 put
 me
 on
 the


spot.
 I
 I I
 don't
 I
 I
 don't
 remember
 all


of
 them.
 Uh


>> why
 don't
 you
 give
 me
 some
 of
 them?
 The


number
 one
 rule,
 and
 I
 borrow
 this
 from


from
 Warren,
 and
 so
 if
 he
 ever,
 you


know,
 he's
 not
 going
 to
 pay
 attention
 to


listen
 to
 me,
 but
 I
 did
 reach
 out
 to


him.
 His
 number
 one
 rule
 is
 don't
 lose


money.
 And
 my
 concern
 with
 don't
 lose


money
 is
 any
 investment
 requires
 the


absorption
 of
 risk.
 And
 so
 if
 you're
 not


willing
 to
 take
 some
 level
 of
 risk,


which
 means
 potentially
 to
 lose
 money,


you
 won't
 make
 money
 either.
 So
 you


don't
 want
 to
 invest
 with
 a
 from
 a
 from


a
 position
 of
 fear.


>> You
 want
 to
 invest
 I
 think
 so
 my
 number


one
 rule
 is
 avoid
 embarrassing
 loss.
 You


want
 to
 avoid
 the
 loss
 of
 a
 company


potentially
 blowing
 up.
 If
 the
 company


might
 you
 know
 if
 it
 looks
 like
 it's
 a


little
 bit
 expensive
 and
 it
 might
 and
 it


might
 go
 potentially
 go
 down
 5%
 or


something
 or
 10%
 or
 20.
 Okay,
 you
 can


deal
 with
 that.
 But
 if
 you're
 investing


in
 a
 company
 where
 if
 something
 goes


wrong,
 you
 could
 wake
 up
 one
 day
 and


it's
 down
 20
 or
 50%.
 That's
 the
 one
 you


don't
 want
 to
 have
 in
 your
 portfolio


because
 investors
 will
 never
 invest
 with


you
 again.


And
 you'll
 also
 be
 scarred
 because


people
 make
 investments.
 This
 is
 why


it's
 so
 difficult
 to
 be
 to
 be
 a


long-term
 sound
 investor
 because


emotions
 get
 in
 the
 way,
 which
 is
 one
 of


my
 rules.
 emotion
 has
 no
 place
 in


investing.
 Another
 rule
 is
 uh
 don't


trust
 management.
 I'm
 sure
 there's
 many


management
 teams
 and
 I
 run
 my
 you
 know


we're
 a
 operating
 business
 uh
 private


company
 and
 it's
 not
 that
 they
 you
 know


you
 you
 shouldn't
 trust
 anything
 they


say
 but
 again
 it's
 it's
 a
 mindset.
 Uh


everything
 you
 do
 is
 is
 about
 how
 you


pos
 you
 you
 present
 your
 your
 mindset


going
 in.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 go
 in
 with
 the


mindset
 of
 don't
 trust,
 then
 you'll
 be


curious.
 Then
 you're
 going
 to
 ask


questions.
 It's
 not
 that
 you
 you
 think


that
 they're
 bad
 people.
 I
 didn't
 say


they're
 bad
 people.
 I
 said
 just
 don't


trust.
 Verify
 and
 then
 trust.
 And
 then


another
 rule
 would
 be
 that
 you
 have
 to


read
 the
 notes
 to
 the
 financial


statements
 first
 before
 you
 actually


read
 the
 statements.
 The
 notes
 to
 the


financial
 statements
 tell
 you
 how
 the


company
 modified
 the
 accounting
 because


it
 ch
 it
 made
 accounting
 choices.
 We


decided
 to
 account
 for
 this
 these
 type


of
 transactions
 in
 this
 way
 so
 that
 when


you
 look
 at
 the
 financial
 statements


once
 you
 know
 how
 they're
 prepared
 you


can
 better
 interpret
 them.
 Accounting
 is


a
 language.
 If
 I
 said
 to
 you
 tomorrow


you're
 going
 to
 speak
 Spanish.
 Oh
 you


know
 you
 could
 do
 AI
 and
 you
 figure
 it


out
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 learn
 it.
 But


the
 nuances
 of
 the
 language,
 an


individual
 who
 did
 a
 PhD
 in
 that


language,
 they're
 going
 to
 understand


way
 more
 about
 the
 language
 than
 you


are.
 The
 same
 like
 reading
 the
 financial


statements.
 The
 more
 you
 understand
 of


what
 went
 into
 them
 and
 how
 they're


prepared,
 the
 better
 you're
 going
 to


interpret
 them.
 What
 are
 the
 red
 flags


you
 look
 for?
 I
 like
 the
 way
 you
 you


posed
 the
 question
 because
 it
 sets
 up


what
 I
 we've
 learned
 over
 time.
 The


problem
 with
 red
 flags
 is
 it
 gets
 to


your
 point
 that
 you
 started
 at
 before


where
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 crying
 wolf.


And
 so
 I've
 learned
 to
 temper
 because


you
 could
 be
 wrong.


>> Mhm.


>> It's
 not
 red
 flags.
 We
 call
 them


flammable
 items.


>> Okay.


>> So
 this
 goes
 to
 the
 pro
 our
 process.


It's
 a
 three-stage
 process
 that
 we
 use


and
 we
 teach
 because
 one
 of
 our
 we
 have


Veritasu
 and
 so
 we
 teach
 investors
 how


to
 make
 better
 investment
 decisions.
 And


so
 the
 the
 first
 stage
 is
 you
 understand


the
 business
 and
 the
 control


environment.
 Okay,
 again
 understand
 and


understand
 the
 accounting
 that's
 being


used
 so
 that
 when
 you
 study
 the


financial
 statements,
 everything
 else,


they
 all
 make
 sense
 and
 you
 understand


sort
 of
 the
 the
 the
 structure,
 how
 is


management
 compensated,
 what
 stage
 of


their
 life
 cycle
 are
 they
 at?
 Because


those
 are
 all
 sort
 of
 constraints
 and


opportunities
 within
 the
 business.
 So


then
 you
 look
 for
 a
 flammable
 item.
 For


example,
 companies
 generating
 negative


cash
 flow.
 That
 could
 be
 by
 itself
 a
 red


flag
 in
 the
 normal
 way.
 This
 this
 type


of
 I
 would
 call
 forensic
 analysis
 is


taught
 unless
 you
 know.
 So
 if
 a


company's
 generating
 negative
 cash,
 it


may
 actually
 be
 a
 fantastic
 thing.


They're
 investing
 in
 an
 AI
 startup
 that


is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 huge
 opportunity.
 and


they've
 shown
 over
 time
 that
 the
 return


on
 invested
 capital
 is
 in
 excess
 of
 20%


or
 50%
 or
 whatever
 it
 is.
 And
 so
 they're


investing
 in
 something.
 Yes,
 it's


negative
 cash
 flow
 today.
 But
 I'm
 not


investing
 for
 the
 cash
 flow
 today.
 I'm


investing
 for
 the
 cash
 flow
 tomorrow.
 So


you
 see
 that
 as
 a
 red
 flag,
 you
 don't


invest
 in
 it.
 And
 unless
 you
 understood


the
 first
 part,
 which
 was
 the
 fact
 that


where
 they
 are
 in
 their
 life
 cycle,
 type


of
 business,
 etc.,
 that
 is
 now
 not
 a
 red


flag.
 It's
 just
 a
 flammable
 item
 by


itself.
 Not
 a
 problem.
 It
 depends.
 And


then
 you
 get
 to
 the
 third
 bucket,
 which


is
 the
 spark.
 And
 so
 you're
 always


looking
 for
 a
 spark
 because
 let's
 use


that
 same
 negative
 cash
 flow.
 Well,
 if


all
 of
 a
 sudden
 a
 new
 competitor
 comes


into
 that
 company's
 operating
 space,


okay,
 and
 is
 able
 to
 take
 market
 share,


>> now
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 that
 negative
 cash


flow
 is
 a
 problem.
 If
 you
 notice
 in
 the


financial
 statements
 when
 you
 look
 at


that
 negative
 cash
 flow,
 the
 company's


taken
 on
 very
 expensive
 debt.
 Again,


very
 expensive
 debt
 by
 itself
 doesn't


mean
 anything
 because
 if
 the
 potential


return
 on
 invested
 capital
 is
 higher


than
 that
 cost
 of
 capital,
 it's
 all


good.
 But
 if
 a
 new
 peer
 comes
 in
 play,


now
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 that
 model
 may
 not


work.
 And
 now
 you
 have
 a
 blowup.
 In
 my


podcast,
 the
 FactFinders,
 I
 I


interviewed
 uh
 an
 individual
 who
 we've


used
 before,
 private
 investigator,
 and


he's
 the
 one
 that
 got
 me
 onto
 this
 this


way
 of
 this
 mental
 model.
 And
 uh
 he


says,
 you
 know,
 if
 the
 CEO
 uh
 beats
 his


wife
 and
 runs
 stop
 signs,
 kicks
 his
 dog,


doesn't
 get
 along
 with
 the
 neighbors,


probably
 could
 be
 a
 problem.
 But
 that's


not
 going
 to
 show
 up
 in
 the
 financial


statements.
 That's
 not
 going
 to
 show
 up


in
 any
 interviews.
 You
 got
 to
 kind
 of


follow
 things
 that
 are
 going
 on.
 What
 is


that
 organization
 stand
 for?
 How
 are


they
 operating?
 What
 are
 their
 values?


But
 not
 just
 what
 they
 write
 down.
 The


culture
 and
 the
 values
 are
 not
 what
 you


read
 on
 the
 financial
 statements
 and
 in


their
 in
 their
 press
 releases.
 We
 wrote


about
 Valiant.
 We
 said
 sell
 Valiant.


Okay?
 We're
 the
 only
 cell
 on
 on
 Valiant


in
 2012
 2013.
 The
 company
 didn't
 blow
 up


until
 2015.
 Okay?
 But
 they
 and
 they


would
 talk
 about
 their
 integrity
 and


their,
 you
 know,
 how
 they
 were
 changing


the
 world
 with
 the
 with
 the
 drug


reformulations
 they
 were
 doing
 and
 so


forth.
 But
 if
 you
 look
 deeper,
 they
 were


just
 manipulating
 the
 accounting
 and


changing
 the
 pricing
 on
 on
 drugs
 and


creating
 a
 fraudulent
 network
 of


onlineies.


>> Valiant's
 a
 good
 one
 because
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 uh
 well-known
 investors
 in
 that.


>> Yeah.
 How
 did
 so
 many
 well-known


wellrespected
 investors
 go
 wrong?
 People


who
 are
 known
 for
 their
 due
 diligence,


people
 who
 are
 known
 for
 their
 leg
 work.


I
 know
 I
 sat
 with
 them
 talked
 to
 them


before
 the
 c
 before
 it's
 a
 situation


where
 someone
 is
 such
 a
 masterful


spinner
 of
 a
 story
 and
 is


>> are
 you
 talking
 to
 the
 CEO


>> the
 CEO
 and
 the
 management
 team
 sold
 you


had
 Mike
 Pearson.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 was
 executing
 and
 you
 know
 he
 comes


he
 came
 from
 a
 great
 pedigree.
 He
 was


not
 taking
 a
 salary
 and
 everything
 was


tied
 to
 the
 stock
 price.
 you
 know,
 he
 he


was,
 you
 know,
 for
 tires
 tirelessly


working
 in
 the
 company
 and
 he'd
 proven


because
 what
 ends
 up
 happening
 is
 price


creates
 narrative.


>> Mhm.


>> So
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 you
 don't
 believe
 it


day
 one,


>> but
 then
 you
 see
 that
 they
 made
 an


acquisition.
 It
 didn't
 seem
 like
 it
 was


going
 to
 work,
 but
 then
 it
 works
 and
 the


stock
 price
 goes
 higher
 and
 then
 they
 do


something
 else
 and
 it
 kind
 of
 seems
 a


little
 bit
 strange.
 And
 then
 they


changed
 their
 accounting
 and
 and
 they


changed
 the
 way
 they
 rec
 they
 they


present
 their
 op
 their
 uh
 non-gash
 gap


metrics
 which
 is
 things
 we
 noticed
 like


that's
 another
 huge
 flammable
 item.
 The


company
 says
 you
 know
 they're
 reporting


their
 they
 use
 an
 adjusted
 IBIDA
 and


they
 calculate
 it
 in
 a
 certain
 way
 and


then
 the
 following
 year
 they
 calculate


it
 a
 different
 way.
 Well
 that's
 a
 non


audited
 number.
 It's
 a
 it's
 whatever


management
 wants
 and
 you
 know
 the


markets
 just
 believe
 it.
 And
 so
 that's


something
 that
 Valiant
 was
 notorious


about,
 but
 didn't
 matter
 because
 the


stock
 price
 just
 kept
 going
 higher.
 And


as
 the
 stock
 price
 keeps
 going
 higher,


it's
 very
 difficult.
 Okay,
 in
 in
 the


money
 management
 industry,
 when
 you're


underperforming,
 it
 is
 so
 difficult
 to


stay
 the
 course.
 M


>> you
 saw
 this
 you
 know
 in
 the
 financial


crisis
 that
 movie
 about
 you
 know
 the
 big


short
 like
 those
 individuals
 were
 became


clients
 of
 ours
 like
 I
 know
 Porter


Collins
 if
 he
 ever
 listens
 here
 and
 and


Danny
 and
 so
 forth
 like
 we
 we
 befriended


each
 other
 during
 during
 this
 time
 of


madness
 and
 afterwards
 it
 was
 like
 they


were
 crazy
 like
 you
 end
 up
 looking
 at


yourself
 going
 I'm
 crazy
 I'm
 seeing
 this


and
 nobody
 cares
 it
 becomes
 so
 difficult


When
 you're
 on
 the
 other
 side
 now,


you're
 trying
 to
 make
 money
 and
 raise


money
 from
 clients
 because
 investors
 now


are
 saying,
 "Well,
 wait
 a
 minute.
 You're


up
 five
 or
 you're
 down
 five,
 market's
 up


20.
 You
 don't
 know
 what
 you're
 doing.


What
 are
 you
 doing?"
 And,
 you
 know,
 it's


hard
 because
 that's
 how
 you
 earn
 your


living.
 That
 I
 think
 becomes
 the
 becomes


the
 problem.
 And
 with
 Valiant,
 it
 just


went
 on
 for
 so
 long.


And
 you
 need
 to
 look
 at
 the
 market


conditions
 at
 the
 time
 because
 the


people
 are
 running
 a
 business
 but
 the


business
 is
 operating
 in
 a
 certain


economic
 environment.
 Well,
 you
 had


brand
 new
 bond
 market
 activity.
 QE.
 No


one
 ever
 heard
 of
 QE
 before
 the
 early


2000
 or
 2010s.
 The
 bank,
 the
 the
 central


banks
 were
 buying
 longdated
 bonds
 to


keep
 interest
 rates
 low.
 Well,
 now
 all


of
 a
 sudden,
 what
 does
 that
 do
 to
 a


company
 like
 Valiant
 that's
 making


that's
 growing
 through
 acquisition
 and


needs
 capital?
 Well,
 they
 could
 borrow


money
 at
 very
 low
 rates.
 And
 if
 that's


the
 case,
 then
 their
 IRR,
 cost
 of


capital,
 etc.
 The
 hurdle
 rate
 is
 very


low.
 So,
 they
 look
 really
 great.
 all


these
 transactions
 that
 may
 not
 have


made
 made
 any
 sense
 in
 other
 time


periods
 when
 risk-f
 free
 rates
 were
 not


you
 know
 in
 the
 1
 or
 2%
 range
 all
 of a


sudden
 they
 make
 sense
 if
 I
 had
 to
 go


back
 in
 time
 we
 should
 have
 said
 buy


valiant


at
 the
 beginning
 because
 we
 had
 studied


biovail
 so
 bio
 valiant
 bought
 val


biovail
 biovail
 was
 a
 Canadian
 company


>> that
 was
 run
 by
 Eugene
 Melnik


And
 we
 wrote
 a
 cell
 report
 on
 on
 that


company
 in
 in
 the
 early
 2000s.
 And
 and


the
 company
 ended
 up
 being
 a
 figment
 of


its
 former
 self.
 And
 but
 it
 had


something
 it
 had
 some
 formulations
 for


of
 drugs
 which
 were
 elongated
 in
 their


uh
 release.
 So
 they
 they
 would
 buy
 a


drug
 and
 then
 repurpose
 the
 the
 the


formulation.
 So
 there'll
 be
 slow
 release


etc.
 And
 then
 they
 and
 they
 also
 had


phenomenal
 tax
 structure
 where
 they
 were


set
 up
 in
 Barbados
 and
 Barbados
 is
 like


heaven.
 So
 the
 more
 money
 you
 make
 as


income,
 you
 pay
 a
 lower
 percentage
 tax.


Imagine
 that.
 So
 what
 Valiant
 did
 was


they
 bought
 that
 structure
 when
 they


bought
 Biovail.


>> And
 so
 that
 allowed
 them
 to
 extract
 all


the
 cost
 of
 tax.
 So
 many
 interesting


things
 they
 did.
 They
 set
 up
 their
 head


office
 in
 Quebec
 province
 in
 Canada,


French
 speakaking.
 Well,
 the
 case,
 which


is
 the
 largest,
 one
 of
 the
 largest


pension
 plans
 in
 Canada,
 right?
 Their


mandate
 is
 not
 just
 to
 make
 money
 for


its
 pensioners,
 okay?
 And
 there,
 this
 is


the
 civil
 pension
 fund,
 one
 of
 and
 I


think
 second
 largest
 in
 Canada
 behind


CPP.
 And
 one
 of
 their
 mandates
 is
 to


invest
 in
 Quebec-based
 companies
 and


foster
 growth.
 It's
 a
 phenomen.
 I
 used


to
 think
 it
 was
 a
 problem,
 but
 actually


I've
 changed
 my
 way.
 I
 think
 CPP
 should


do
 the
 same.
 CPP
 should
 be
 encouraged
 to


invest
 in
 Canada.
 The
 US
 pension
 plan


should
 buy
 US
 companies.
 Encouraged
 to


do
 that.
 Anyway,
 so
 in
 this
 case,
 you


set
 up
 in
 Quebec,
 you
 know,
 you've
 got
 a


set
 flow
 of
 capital
 that's
 going
 to
 come


from
 this
 Quebecbased
 pension
 plan.
 And


I
 remember
 meeting
 with
 the
 with
 the


leaders
 at
 the
 case
 at
 the
 time
 talking


about
 this
 and
 they're
 like,
 "We
 don't


want
 to
 own
 it.
 We're
 we
 we
 agree
 with


you,
 Anthony.
 We're
 worried
 about
 all


this
 stuff."
 But
 these
 are
 the


subtleties
 that
 you
 need
 like
 every


again
 when
 you
 see
 it's
 a
 flammable.
 You


didn't
 even
 know
 that
 was
 a
 flammable


item
 unless
 you
 know
 from
 the
 first


page,
 oh,
 they're
 set
 up
 in
 Quebec.
 And


you
 go,
 why
 did
 that
 happen?
 which
 is


part
 of
 the
 mental
 model
 of
 being


curious
 to
 say
 nothing
 happens
 without
 a


reason.
 If
 you
 notice
 something
 and
 you


go,
 "Well,
 that
 seems
 really
 weird.
 No


one
 else
 does
 that."
 And
 most
 people


just
 say,
 "Well,
 it's
 okay.
 It
 doesn't


matter."
 Well,
 actually,
 that's
 what


matters.


>> Is
 complicated
 just
 in
 general
 like
 a


red
 flag
 for
 you?
 I
 remember
 Buffett
 and


Munger
 got
 entailed
 with
 something
 with


the
 SEC
 in
 the
 early
 '7s.
 I
 think
 it
 was


their
 structure
 was
 just
 it
 was
 uh


legal.
 It
 was
 rational.
 It
 was
 not


transparent
 if
 I
 recall
 correctly.
 It


was
 incredibly
 complicated


and
 they
 ended
 up
 simplifying
 it,
 but


they
 weren't
 doing
 anything
 wrong.


>> So
 again,
 I've,
 you
 know,
 sat
 with


management
 teams
 and
 you
 go
 through


their
 10K
 and
 then
 you
 see
 a
 list
 of
 all


their
 operating
 subsidiaries
 and
 you
 see


the
 different
 places
 that
 they're


operating.
 Again
 thing
 about
 investing


today
 is
 there's
 so
 much
 pressure
 on
 the


analysts
 to
 cover
 more
 stocks.


>> The
 money
 management
 fees
 today
 are
 a


fraction
 of
 what
 they
 were
 even
 a
 decade


ago.


>> Right?


>> So
 the
 companies
 that
 are
 doing
 the


investing,
 the
 fixed
 cost
 of
 doing


investing,
 like
 paying
 the
 audit,
 doing


the
 back
 office,
 all
 that
 stuff,
 yes,


it's
 come
 down
 a
 bit,
 but
 it's
 still


there.


>> Yeah.
 All
 that's
 been
 squeezed
 is
 the
 co


the
 the
 cost
 of
 the
 money
 management.
 So


they're
 having
 to
 look
 for
 shortcuts
 and


that
 means
 just
 give
 me
 the
 number,


Anthony.
 Just
 give
 me
 that
 one
 number.
 I


just
 want
 that
 one
 number
 and
 then
 you


get
 the
 one
 number
 that
 management
 gives


them
 and
 then
 they
 just
 accept
 that
 and


move
 on.


>> I
 was
 talking
 and
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


mention
 who
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 a


well-known
 CFO
 once
 about
 earnings


management.


>> Yes.
 and
 they
 said,
 you
 know,
 we
 would


call
 analysts
 after
 the
 earnings
 call


and
 we
 would,
 you
 know,
 legally,
 but
 we


would
 definitely
 lead
 them
 uh
 to
 what


numbers
 to
 expect
 for
 the
 next
 quarter


even
 if
 we
 weren't
 and
 we
 would


sometimes
 manipulate
 that
 if
 we
 wanted


to.
 And
 I
 always
 thought
 that
 that
 was
 a


bit
 nefarious,
 but
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 how


people
 work
 and
 how
 the
 world
 works.
 So


just
 being,
 you
 know,
 to
 I
 think
 you


asked
 the
 question,
 is
 being
 complicated


a
 a
 problem?
 Well,
 it's
 just
 why
 is
 it


happening?
 And
 you
 go
 back
 to
 nothing


happens
 without
 a
 reason.
 Then
 you
 point


to
 some
 company
 operating
 in
 the
 British


Virgin
 Islands
 that's
 listed
 on
 the
 list


and
 go,
 what
 does
 this
 company
 do?


>> Yeah.


>> And
 management
 starts
 sweating
 and
 say,


why
 are
 you
 asking
 that?
 I
 don't
 know.


You
 have
 your
 answer
 before
 you
 ask
 a


question.
 Do
 you
 get
 to
 a
 point
 where


things
 are
 like
 too
 complicated?
 People


don't
 even
 know
 what's
 going
 on.
 Like
 it


it
 always
 starts
 with
 like
 this
 one


thing
 makes
 sense
 and
 but
 over
 you
 know


30
 40
 years
 you
 end
 up
 with
 this


structure
 that
 nobody
 even
 internally


probably
 understands.


>> You
 know
 they
 they
 interviewed
 um
 fast


Andrew
 Fastau
 who
 is
 the
 CFO
 of
 of
 Enron


and
 he's
 done
 many
 an
 interview
 on
 this.


Also
 I
 I
 because
 when
 we
 do
 our
 training


we
 have
 a
 few
 of
 these
 interviews
 that


we
 that
 we
 quote
 and
 it's
 companies


don't
 start
 out
 as
 being
 crooked.
 They


have
 to
 convince
 someone
 to
 buy
 a


product
 okay
 or
 a
 service.
 So
 money


comes
 in
 to
 the
 company
 in
 some
 fashion


or
 time
 and
 then
 gets
 converted
 into


something
 that
 adds
 value.


The
 problem
 becomes
 outside
 stakeholders


come
 in
 and
 say,
 "Well,
 I
 need
 you
 to


make
 X
 because
 you
 want
 my
 money.
 Well,


I'll
 give
 you
 my
 money
 so
 long
 as
 you


give
 me
 this
 return."
 Well,
 that
 works


until
 there's
 a
 problem.
 And
 now
 there's


no
 CEO
 that
 wants
 to
 disappoint.


So,
 it's
 very
 simple.
 The
 CFO
 comes
 to


talk
 to
 me.
 I'm
 the
 CEO.
 And
 he
 says,


"Look,
 I
 know
 uh
 Anthony,
 we
 were
 going


to
 make
 a
 dollar,
 but
 we're
 coming
 in
 at


95."
 And
 I
 say
 to
 him,
 "You
 get
 back
 to


your
 room
 and
 find
 me
 5
 cents."


>> Yeah.


>> You
 like
 your
 job.
 You
 like
 your
 kids


going
 to
 private
 school.
 You
 like
 your


stock
 options,
 how
 much
 they're
 worth.


You
 see
 all
 these
 employees
 we
 have,


they
 we
 give
 them
 stock
 as
 a
 part
 of


their
 compensation
 every
 quarter.
 Like


that's
 a
 problem.
 We
 can't
 disappoint.


And
 then
 it
 starts


>> and
 it
 starts
 slowly.


>> It
 always
 starts
 slowly.
 And
 look,
 there


>> that
 was
 what
 Andy
 said
 in
 in
 the
 I


think
 correct
 those
 interviews.
 It's


like,
 you
 know,
 it
 started
 with
 a
 little


bit
 and
 I
 figured
 next
 quarter
 I
 could


bring
 it
 back


>> and
 it's
 just,
 you
 know,
 that's
 the


thing.
 Life
 is
 a
 dangerous
 thing
 this


way.
 Whether
 we
 push
 something
 even
 in


life,
 right?
 You
 know,
 well,
 look,
 if
 I


smoke
 a
 bit
 or
 drink
 a
 bit
 or
 tell
 this


little
 lie,
 you
 know,
 no
 one
 notices
 and


I'm
 I'm
 okay.
 Well,
 then
 maybe
 I
 do
 a


little
 bit
 more
 of
 each
 one
 of
 those


things
 and
 no
 one
 notices
 and
 then
 it's


all
 good,
 right?
 But
 then
 switching


gears
 a
 little
 bit,
 do
 companies
 that


report
 free
 cash
 flow
 on
 their
 press


releases
 or
 in
 their
 financial


statements
 tend
 to
 outperform?


>> I
 don't
 have
 that
 data.


>> What
 would
 be
 your
 guess?
 It's
 not
 a


common
 metric
 to
 report.


>> My
 guess
 is
 I
 would
 say
 not
 necessarily


no.
 I
 would
 say
 no.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 of
 ibida?
 IDA
 is
 the


mother
 of
 all
 disastrous


measures.


>> Why?


>> Because
 of
 what
 investors
 want
 to


believe
 that
 it
 is
 and
 that
 it's


something
 that
 is
 cash
 flow
 that
 it's


something
 that
 can
 be
 compared
 to
 de


total
 debt
 and
 it
 is
 not.
 It
 is
 purely
 a


operating
 performance
 metric


calculated
 before
 interest,
 tax,


depreciation
 and
 amortization.
 That's


it.
 Now
 what
 runs
 into
 a
 problem
 is
 well


what
 do
 I
 do
 with
 stock
 options?
 What
 do


I
 do
 with
 joint
 venture
 gains?
 What
 do
 I


do
 with
 gains
 on
 investments
 that
 I
 made


that
 I
 happen
 to
 sell
 this
 year?
 What
 do


I
 do
 with
 the
 charges
 that
 I
 took
 on


that
 acquisition
 that
 I
 bought
 this
 year


that
 I
 included
 in
 my
 ibita
 the
 profits


but
 at
 the
 cost
 that
 associated
 with


that
 operate
 that
 transaction
 should
 I


include
 that
 in
 ITA


>> aren't
 those
 onetime
 costs


>> if
 making
 acquisitions
 is
 part
 of
 my


business
 model


>> I
 no
 longer
 one-time
 costs
 this
 gets
 us


back
 to
 we
 have
 a
 course
 called
 the


secrets
 of
 free
 cash
 flow
 and
 that's


been
 our
 most
 watched
 uh
 and
 taught


course
 and
 that's
 because
 it
 started
 we


said
 it
 earlier
 we
 said
 free
 cash
 flow


is
 operating
 cash
 flow
 less
 capex
 but


it's
 not
 it
 depends
 every
 every
 answer


that
 someone
 asks
 you
 what
 is
 what


should
 it
 be
 well
 it
 depends


>> depends
 on
 the
 company


>> you
 got
 it
 how
 should
 I
 calculate
 it


well
 it
 depends
 what
 decision
 do
 you


need
 to
 make
 you
 always
 start
 with
 the


facts
 before
 you
 think
 about
 a


transaction
 and
 how
 you're
 going
 to


account
 for
 it
 it's
 all
 about
 the
 facts


the
 constraints
 and
 the
 objectives,


right?
 The
 facts
 determine
 what
 did
 I


sell,
 what
 did
 I
 buy,
 from
 who,
 at
 what


cost,
 under
 what
 terms,
 etc.
 So,
 those


are
 the
 facts
 broadly.
 Then
 I
 have
 the


constraints.
 Well,
 I'm
 a
 private


company.
 Who
 uses
 the
 statements?
 Well,


just
 me
 and
 my
 partners.
 Who
 cares
 where


I
 put
 it?
 It's
 less
 less
 important.
 But


if
 there's
 an
 outside
 onlooker
 on
 this,


well,
 now
 it
 matters
 because
 they're


looking
 at
 it.
 I
 now
 have
 outside


investors.
 I
 have
 debt.
 I
 have
 a
 debt


covenant.
 All
 of
 those
 things.
 I'm


public
 now.
 I
 have
 the
 SEC.
 Those
 are


all
 constraints.
 I
 operate
 in
 the
 US.
 I


got
 FASBY,
 PCAOB.
 I
 operate
 in
 Canada.
 I


have
 IFRS.
 I
 have
 CPAB.
 And
 the
 last
 is


the
 objectives.
 I
 want
 to
 sell
 my


business
 this
 year.
 And
 my
 business


sells
 on
 IBATA.
 Buddy,
 I'll
 tell
 you
 how


I'm
 going
 to
 account
 for
 it.
 My
 business


investors
 want
 free
 cash
 flow.
 I'll
 tell


you
 how
 we're
 going
 to
 account
 for
 it.


It's
 those
 three
 points.


When
 I
 teach
 accounting,
 I
 teach
 those


three
 things.


>> That's
 fascinating.
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 stock


options
 for
 a
 little
 bit.
 You
 brought


that
 up.
 I
 want
 to
 come
 back
 to
 this.


Like,
 how
 should
 investors
 think
 about


stock
 options
 today?
 And
 then
 how
 would


you
 change
 accounting
 rules
 to
 better


account
 for
 stock
 options?
 Two
 separate


questions,
 but


>> Shane,
 you're
 good.


>> I
 hate
 them
 personally
 in
 public


companies.
 However,
 I
 I
 understand
 why


companies
 want
 to
 use
 them.
 I
 mean,
 my


take
 is
 there,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 look
 at


most
 buybacks,
 they're
 just
 covering
 up


stock
 options.


>> Correct.
 Very
 good.


>> So,
 that's
 an
 expansion.


>> I
 think
 that
 uh
 stock
 options
 what
 they


do
 every
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 human


motivation.
 So
 if
 I
 am
 going
 to


compensate
 you
 on
 the
 stock
 price,
 then


you're
 going
 to
 make
 decisions
 that
 move


the
 stock
 price.
 In
 my
 early
 classes


when
 I
 teach
 um
 I
 I
 always
 say
 that


economy
 and
 economics
 reality
 is
 way


over
 here
 as
 far
 as
 I
 can
 see
 with
 my


hand
 and
 the
 accounting
 is
 way
 over


there
 as
 far
 as
 I
 can
 go
 with
 my
 hand.


Because
 if
 for
 example,


you
 know,
 I'm
 going
 to
 take
 a
 very


simple
 manufacturing
 company
 because


everybody
 understands
 that
 we
 make
 pens.


We
 drive
 pens.
 We're
 making
 a,000
 pens


an
 hour.
 And
 I
 sell
 the
 pen.
 You
 sell,


you
 know,
 today
 we
 made,
 you
 know,
 over


eight
 hours
 made
 8,000
 pens.
 One
 of
 my


salespeople
 sells
 a,000
 pens.
 Well,
 how


do
 I
 calculate
 the
 cost
 of
 that,000


pens?
 Do
 I
 just
 take
 the
 8,000
 pens
 that


I
 do,
 divide,
 take
 1,000
 over
 8,000,


that's
 the
 total
 cost,
 and
 then
 that's


what
 I
 allocate?
 Right?
 The
 reality
 is
 I


sold
 them
 a,000
 pens
 and
 it
 was
 the
 last


thousand.


Do
 I
 stop
 the
 press,
 figure
 out
 the
 cost


of
 that
 last
 thousand?
 Do
 I
 average
 it?


Do
 I,
 even
 though
 I
 sold
 them
 the
 last


ones,
 do
 I
 calculate
 the
 cost
 of
 the


first
 thousand,
 which
 may
 be
 a
 little


bit
 higher
 because
 there
 were
 some
 setup


cost
 to
 change
 my
 machine
 to
 make
 the


thousand.
 M


>> all
 of
 those
 three
 options
 I
 gave
 you
 a


business
 reality
 for
 what
 the
 accounting


is
 FIFO
 LIFO
 or
 average
 cost.
 So
 the


reality
 is
 I
 sold
 them
 the
 last


thousand.
 The
 accountant
 said
 well
 we


want
 to
 show
 high
 margin
 so
 we're
 going


to
 use
 average
 and
 that's
 all
 good.
 That


ties
 that
 point.
 But
 I
 want
 to
 get
 to


your
 question
 because
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 I


I
 I
 got
 on
 a
 sidetrack
 and
 I
 want
 to


answer
 your
 question
 about
 stock


options.
 So
 I
 think
 stock
 options
 should


be
 an
 expense
 and
 if
 they're
 not
 an


expense
 I
 I
 borrow
 from
 Buffett
 and
 even


the
 chair
 of
 accounting
 has
 said
 things


like
 this
 that
 that
 if
 it's
 not
 an


expense
 then
 what
 is
 it?
 You
 can
 choose


to
 pay
 someone
 in
 stock
 options
 or
 you


can
 choose
 to
 pay
 them
 in
 cash.
 So
 if
 I


pay
 all
 my
 employees,
 you
 pay,
 you
 have


the
 same
 company,
 you're
 we're
 a


competitor.
 You
 pay
 all
 your
 employees


with
 stock
 options.
 I
 pay
 them
 in
 cash.


I
 have
 a
 lower
 EBIDA.
 I
 have
 a
 lower


EPS.
 Your
 stock
 trades
 higher
 than
 mine.


Stock
 price
 goes
 down.
 All
 of
 a
 sudden,


all
 your
 employees
 leave
 and
 they
 want


to
 come
 work
 for
 me.
 And
 all
 my
 guys
 are


pretty
 happy.
 They
 don't
 care.
 So
 you


should
 include
 it
 as
 an
 expense.
 taking


this
 one
 step
 further
 to
 and
 why
 I


brought
 up
 reality
 and
 accounting
 is


that
 as
 an
 employee
 at
 any
 level
 even


the
 CEO
 and
 CFO
 sure
 the
 things
 they
 say


the
 things
 they
 do
 will
 affect
 market's


perception
 of
 the
 company
 perhaps
 in
 the


near
 term
 perhaps
 in
 the
 medium
 term
 but


in
 the
 in
 the
 longer
 term
 in
 the
 in
 the


fullness
 of
 time
 the
 results
 will
 prove


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 but
 the


management
 and
 and
 the
 the
 guy
 on
 the


shop
 floor
 even
 the
 sales
 manager
 may


have
 no
 impact
 on
 what
 actually
 happens


in
 the
 stock
 price.
 Yesterday,
 Powell


cuts
 rates.
 So,
 that
 moves
 the
 company's


price.
 All
 of
 a
 sudden,
 as
 an
 employee,


I'm
 better
 off
 or
 worse
 off.
 But,
 I
 had


no
 effect
 on
 that.
 I
 had
 no
 nothing
 to


do
 with
 that.
 A
 new
 peer
 enters
 the


enters
 our
 business
 uh
 in
 our
 in
 our
 as


a
 new
 competitor.
 I
 have
 no
 effect
 on


that.
 All
 of
 a
 sudden,
 GDP
 slows
 down.


My
 business
 isn't
 even
 affected
 because


the
 GDP
 is
 tied
 more
 to
 consumption


problems.
 My
 business
 is
 a
 B2B
 business


that's
 totally
 outside
 of
 being
 affected


by
 current
 G
 GDP
 movements
 and
 my
 stock


price
 falls.
 I
 had
 no
 control
 over
 that.


So
 I
 think
 it
 it
 incentivizes
 what
 I


think
 the
 wrong
 thing
 is
 and
 makes


people
 make
 potential
 decisions
 which


can
 manipulate
 the
 stock
 price
 which
 may


or
 may
 not
 be
 good
 for
 the
 company.


>> So
 do
 you
 adjust
 I
 guess
 for
 options?


You
 just
 consider
 them
 an
 expense.
 you
 I


I
 think
 that
 you
 know
 options
 are
 are


super
 interesting
 because
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 that
 report
 profits
 aren't


actually
 profitable
 if
 you
 factor
 in
 the


stock
 options
 and
 I
 had
 a
 friend
 who


actually
 put
 me
 onto
 this
 about
 10
 years


ago
 and
 I
 was
 visiting
 his
 factory
 he


doesn't
 give
 a
 stock
 options
 I
 was
 like


well
 how
 do
 you
 compete
 he's
 like
 well
 I


I
 mean
 I
 hire
 the
 best
 people
 and
 you


know
 they
 tell
 me
 they
 they
 have
 stock


options
 at
 their
 company
 and
 it's
 a


public
 company
 I'll
 give
 you
 the
 options


on
 their
 company.


>> Oh.
 On
 their
 stock.


>> On
 their
 stock.
 Not
 my
 company
 or
 my


stock.
 And
 I'll
 pay
 you
 in
 cash
 and
 I'll


give
 you
 a
 cash
 bonus.


>> And
 so
 this
 is
 how
 he
 recruited
 all
 the


best
 people.


>> Wow.


>> And
 one
 of
 the
 interesting
 things
 about


this
 was
 after
 that
 meeting,
 I
 was
 like,


I
 wonder
 where
 if
 I
 went
 fishing,
 like


you
 talk
 about
 fishing
 a
 pond,
 right?


>> And
 if
 I
 could
 increase
 the
 ratio
 of


what
 I'm
 looking
 at
 to
 be
 solid.
 And
 so


I
 looked
 for
 companies
 that
 stopped


stock
 options.


And
 there's
 not
 many
 of
 them,
 but
 when


you
 find
 one,
 it's
 usually
 like
 a
 good


place
 to
 start
 looking
 for
 an


investment.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 a
 that's
 a
 good
 point.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 of
 other
 incentives


and
 inside
 companies


>> such
 as


>> I
 don't
 know
 like
 what
 else
 drives
 sort


of
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 either
 good
 or
 bad


incentives?
 Like
 what
 do
 you
 if
 you
 only


had
 access
 to
 financial
 reporting,
 uh,


management
 reporting,
 conference
 calls,


like
 what
 are
 the
 things
 on
 the
 calls


that
 you
 would
 look
 for?
 What
 are
 the


things


>> I'm
 going
 to
 look
 for?
 Okay,
 so
 for
 to


answer
 your
 question
 is
 about
 what
 what


incentives
 do
 I
 think
 are
 are
 make


sense?
 Well,
 you
 look
 at
 what
 the
 key


measures
 of
 success
 are
 for
 the
 company


and
 do
 those
 align
 with
 investors


interest.
 So
 investors
 are
 cons
 are
 care


about
 the
 company
 longevity,
 its
 ability


to
 generate
 cash,
 its
 ability
 to
 grow


and
 sustain
 itself.
 And
 if
 the
 company's


incentives
 aren't
 linked
 to
 that,
 so
 if


they're
 not
 tied
 to,
 you
 know,
 cost


control,
 if
 they're
 not
 tied
 to
 uh


driving
 revenues
 from
 an
 organic


standpoint,
 not
 just
 from
 acquisitions,


um
 if
 they're
 not,
 you
 know,
 if
 they're


if
 they're
 ti
 if
 they're
 driven
 by


acquisition,
 but
 with
 no
 care
 to
 what's


going
 on
 on
 the
 balance
 sheet,
 um
 that's


a
 problem.
 I
 would
 say,
 you
 know,
 it's


it's
 not
 easy
 to
 say
 that
 there's
 I
 hate


I'm
 sorry,
 but
 one
 here's
 the
 one
 thing


and
 it's
 going
 to
 work.
 But
 I
 think
 it's


it's
 one
 where
 is
 it
 consistent?
 Did
 it


change?


>> Did
 a
 company
 say,
 you
 know,
 we're
 going


to
 pay
 management
 on
 X
 performance


metric.
 If
 they
 hit
 it,
 they
 get
 100%.


If
 they
 don't,
 they
 get
 some
 graduated


scale.
 Well,
 then
 management
 doesn't
 hit


it
 and
 they
 change
 the
 the
 metric
 and


management
 still
 gets
 a
 bonus.
 I
 think


that's
 a
 problem.


>> Oh,
 totally.
 Yeah.


>> Because
 now
 what
 that
 does
 is
 it
 says


that's
 that
 everything's
 okay.


>> And
 you
 know
 it's
 hard
 again
 now
 I'm
 a


board.
 See
 the
 the
 more
 you
 learn
 and


the
 more
 experience
 you
 have
 you


understand
 more
 about
 what
 you
 don't


know
 and
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 to


learn.
 Well
 the
 board
 is
 making
 these


decisions
 and
 everybody
 say
 oh
 the


board's
 bad
 and
 boards
 are
 bad.
 think


well
 no
 the
 board
 wants
 to
 retain
 the


CEO
 and
 often
 times
 you
 know
 that
 could


be
 a
 very
 significant
 personality


and
 that
 personality
 may
 you
 know


there's
 other
 companies
 that
 want
 that


individual
 to
 work
 there
 so
 they
 have
 to


retain
 them
 and
 often
 times
 money
 is
 is


is
 retaining
 that's
 something
 that


becomes
 a
 problem


>> what
 is
 the
 role
 of
 the
 board


>> the
 role
 of
 the
 board
 is
 to
 embrace
 the


position
 uh
 and
 and
 the
 and
 the


viewpoint
 of
 the
 shareholder
 andor
 the


stakeholder.
 I
 we
 always
 always
 focus
 on


the
 shareholder
 but
 stakeholder


stakeholders
 employees
 uh
 customers
 the


communities
 the
 company
 works
 in
 the


competitors


and
 embrace
 each
 of
 those
 and
 ensure


that
 the
 company
 is
 making
 decisions
 or


that
 the
 executive
 is
 making
 decisions


in
 the
 best
 interests
 of
 those


stakeholders.
 oftent
 times
 they
 just


focus
 on
 you
 know
 shareholder
 value.


>> Well
 what
 is
 shareholder
 value?
 Is
 that


just
 something
 that
 we
 can
 calculate
 on


the
 financial
 statements
 or
 calculate


into
 the
 stock
 price
 or
 is
 that
 that


they've
 built
 a
 vibrant
 employee
 base


that
 is
 growing
 and
 everyone
 and
 has
 a


great
 culture
 that
 regardless
 of
 what's


going
 to
 happen
 in
 the
 stock
 price


they're
 going to
 get
 through
 it.
 Are


they
 focused
 on
 uh
 you
 know
 in
 the
 in


the
 communities
 in
 which
 they
 operate


and
 ensuring
 that
 they
 sustain


themselves?
 Because
 if
 they're
 just


milking
 that
 community
 or
 that


environment
 wherever
 they're
 working,


well
 then
 what
 happens
 when
 they've


finished
 milking
 it?
 Are
 is
 that


business
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 continue?


And
 so
 it's
 something
 I've
 spoken
 on


before
 this
 and
 I
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 more


than
 just
 shareholder
 value
 calculated


that
 way.
 How
 do
 you
 think
 most
 board


members
 get
 selected?


>> Oftentimes,
 uh,
 by
 relationships,


>> going
 back
 to
 humans
 run
 companies.


>> That's
 correct.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 you
 to
 be
 on
 my
 board.


If
 I
 like
 you,
 think
 you're
 going
 to


agree
 with
 me.


>> And
 you
 know,
 look,
 we
 we
 have
 a
 a


board.
 We
 also
 have
 a
 a
 found
 a
 board
 in


our
 foundation.
 And
 I
 want
 to
 bring
 on


people
 that
 are
 going
 to
 make
 us
 better.


>> That
 might
 mean
 that
 some
 conversations


are
 not
 always,
 "Yes,
 Anthony.
 Yes,


Anthony.
 I
 I
 like
 I I
 actually
 don't


want
 that.
 I
 I
 want
 even
 in
 my
 my
 own


partners
 and
 my
 own
 employees,
 I
 I


welcome
 please
 come
 in.
 The
 door's
 open.


Tell
 me
 what
 I'm
 doing
 wrong.
 We're
 not


going
 to
 get
 better.
 I'm
 not
 going to


get
 better
 if
 someone
 doesn't
 tell
 me


I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 doing
 something
 wrong.


>> That
 is
 an
 uncommon
 view.


>> But
 it's
 the
 only
 way
 to
 progress,
 I


believe.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that
 we're
 going


to
 decide
 what
 you
 said,
 but
 I
 want
 to


hear
 it.
 If
 you
 don't
 and
 and
 then
 and


the
 danger
 they
 say,
 "Well,
 if
 you


listen
 to
 it
 and
 then
 don't
 do
 anything


about
 it,
 then
 it's
 like
 you
 disregarded


it."
 I
 said,
 "No,
 you
 listen
 to
 it
 and


you
 go
 back
 to
 the
 person,
 thanks
 for


the
 input.
 Here's
 what
 we've
 decided
 to


do
 as
 a
 result
 of
 what
 you've
 said."


>> Yeah.


>> And
 then
 they
 feel
 like
 they
 were
 part


of
 it.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 of
 the
 rise
 of


indexing?
 I
 think
 it's
 what
 do
 they
 I


don't
 know
 the
 exact
 stat
 but
 the
 a
 huge


percentage
 of
 money
 now
 is
 is
 passively


invested
 in
 ETFs
 of
 one
 form
 or
 another


and
 we've
 never
 seen
 this
 concentration


invested
 in
 say
 blindly
 because
 I
 mean


indexing
 works
 though
 and
 it
 works
 it


has
 worked
 over
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time


>> again
 you
 know
 the
 price
 creates
 a


narrative
 and
 so
 if
 indexing
 works
 then


why
 not
 do
 it
 the
 danger
 I
 think
 we're


having
 of
 the
 index
 investing,
 passive


investing,
 is
 that
 in
 essence,
 all
 that


is
 is
 momentum
 investing
 because
 it's
 a


you're
 buying
 an
 index
 which
 is
 market


cap
 weighted.
 So
 the
 money
 that
 you're


investing
 is
 going
 to
 the
 largest
 market


cap
 companies.
 Those
 companies
 continue


to
 grow.
 They
 drag
 the
 index
 higher.
 You


know,
 there's
 really
 two
 indexes.


There's
 the
 MAG
 7
 and
 the
 sloppy
 493.


And
 so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 earnings


expectations
 of
 the
 slot
 before
 93
 for


this
 year,
 there's
 virtually
 no
 growth.


But
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 growth
 of
 the


MAG7,
 it
 continues
 to
 go
 higher.


And
 so
 I
 think
 that
 the
 the
 danger
 is


that
 if
 that
 reverses,
 I'm
 not
 saying


it's
 going
 to
 reverse,
 but
 if
 that
 slows


then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 what's
 been


dragging
 the
 index
 higher
 will
 drag
 the


index
 lower
 in
 the
 same
 veracity


>> because
 they
 are
 the
 largest
 cap.
 So
 if


you
 know
 if
 one
 of
 the
 large
 if
 if


Microsoft
 were
 to
 miss
 and
 I'm
 not


saying
 they're
 going
 to
 miss
 anything


but
 if
 they
 if
 their
 earning
 growth


slows


>> right


>> all
 of
 a
 sudden
 the
 stock
 falls
 like


>> well
 we
 saw
 this
 in
 April
 right
 we
 saw


this
 huge
 draw
 down
 in
 a
 very
 short


period
 of
 time


>> you
 know
 the
 thing
 about
 those
 draw


downs
 because
 each
 of
 the
 drawdowns
 that


draw
 down
 occurred
 because
 Trump
 put


together
 a
 tablet
 he
 came
 down
 from


Mount
 Olympus
 brought
 down
 a
 tablet


Right.
 I
 have
 a
 picture
 of
 it
 that
 I
 use


in
 my
 presentations
 and
 showed
 how
 much


the
 the
 tariff
 he
 was
 going
 to
 charge
 on


all
 these
 countries
 and
 that
 created


immediate
 fear
 in
 the
 market,
 right?


Costs
 of
 companies
 were
 going
 to
 go
 up,


transaction
 were
 going
 to
 go
 down,


revenues
 get
 hurt,
 margins
 get
 hurt,


stock
 prices
 get
 hammered.
 But
 what
 the


the
 second
 third
 level
 thinking
 on
 that


is,
 well,
 wait
 a
 minute,
 these
 haven't


been
 enacted.


There's
 still
 time.
 Maybe
 they
 don't


happen.
 And
 if
 they
 don't
 happen,
 well,


maybe
 all
 this
 draw
 down
 doesn't
 mean


anything.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 it's
 like
 an
 ex
 exogenous
 impact
 on


the
 market.
 It
 wasn't
 something
 that
 the


market
 fell
 on
 itself.


>> What
 I
 think
 would
 cause
 a
 a
 more
 a


downturn
 similar
 more
 like
 what
 happened


in
 '08
 or
 even
 even
 in
 the
 early
 2000s.


Like
 people
 forget
 that
 in
 the
 early


2000
 they
 say,
 "Oh,
 the
 2000
 crash."


Well,
 actually
 the
 market
 was
 lower
 in


203
 than
 it
 was
 in
 2000,
 but
 everyone


thinks
 that
 it
 happened
 in
 2000.
 It


actually
 didn't.
 It
 began.
 It's
 like


that's
 when
 it
 started,


>> right?


>> Kept
 going
 for
 years.


>> And
 the
 other
 ones
 have
 been
 relatively


fast
 even
 in
 the
 financial
 crisis.
 That


that
 one
 actually
 the
 peak
 was
 in
 ' 07.


>> In
 September
 07,
 that
 was
 the
 peak.
 And


the
 bottom
 was
 March
 09.
 That's
 a
 lot
 of


That's
 a
 lot
 of
 pain.
 That's
 18
 months


of
 pain.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 what
 what
 I


think
 could
 make
 this
 one
 be
 a
 longer


one
 if
 it
 if
 something
 were
 to
 occur
 is


it
 comes
 from
 earnings
 slowing
 down


>> and
 earnings
 growth
 slowing
 down.


>> That
 would
 be
 something
 that
 would
 take


longer
 to
 repair
 especially
 when
 a
 lot


of
 the
 earnings
 are
 interconnected
 as
 I


talked
 about
 because
 the
 companies
 are


dealing
 with
 each
 other.


>> It's
 not
 like
 one
 thing
 you
 can
 you
 know


you
 have
 this
 band-aid
 you
 rip
 it
 off.


It's
 like
 the
 slow


>> Yes.
 Yes.


>> reorienting.


>> You
 know,
 we've
 seen
 there
 there's


meaningful
 changes
 that
 are
 going
 on


here,
 right?
 Like
 Lululemon
 is
 trading


at
 a
 low
 much
 lower
 price
 today
 than
 it


was
 last
 year.


>> Let's
 talk
 about
 stock
 buybacks.


>> Share
 count
 doesn't
 necessarily
 go
 down,


but
 buybacks
 are
 happening.


>> It's
 the
 same
 as
 stock
 options
 in
 a


sense
 and
 the
 disparity
 between
 reality,


economic
 reality,
 and
 what's
 going
 on
 in


the
 accounting.
 So
 when
 you
 buy
 back


stock,
 the
 company
 is
 making
 a


investment
 in
 a
 security.


>> Mhm.


>> Which
 it
 partially
 has
 control
 over
 what


it
 does,
 but
 it
 doesn't
 have
 full


control
 over
 what
 happens
 to
 that


investment
 value.
 Whereas
 if
 it
 takes


its
 cash
 and
 buys
 an
 an
 operating
 asset


that
 expands
 its
 current
 production
 and


if
 it's
 already
 generating
 a
 meaningful


return,
 then
 that
 return
 should
 continue


>> and
 expand.
 So
 to
 me,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


point
 that
 says
 I
 have
 no
 other


investments
 in
 my
 business
 that
 would


generate
 a
 return
 higher
 than
 my
 cost
 of


capital.
 And
 so
 I'm
 going
 out
 and
 buying


my
 stock
 and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 very
 risky.


>> How
 should
 investors
 look
 at
 that
 or


account
 for
 that?


>> I'm
 not
 so
 concerned
 about
 the


accounting
 stock
 buyback.


>> So
 if
 you're
 saying
 they
 should


investment
 though,


>> I
 understand.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 what
 they


should
 do
 is
 they
 should
 look
 at


earnings


on
 a
 pre.


So
 look
 at
 the
 earnings
 that
 the


company's
 generating.
 Before
 you
 divide


it
 by
 the
 number
 of
 shares,


>> okay,


>> to
 see
 is
 that
 number
 growing,


>> okay?


>> Relative
 to
 the
 revenues,


>> right?


>> Because
 now
 you're
 seeing
 uh
 is
 it
 or
 is


it
 just
 coming
 from
 a
 reduction
 of
 stock


number
 of
 shares
 outstanding?
 And
 if
 the


company's
 taking
 on
 debt,
 here's
 the


classic
 example.


company
 generates
 uh
 the
 company
 borrows


money
 to
 buy
 back
 stock.
 Why?
 Because


because
 it's
 such
 an
 a
 highly
 perceived


value
 company
 and
 generates
 cash,
 it
 can


borrow
 money
 and
 at
 a
 very
 low
 price
 and


invest
 it
 in
 in
 its
 own
 stock,
 which
 has


historically
 generated
 a
 greater
 return


than
 how
 much
 it
 has
 to
 pay
 in
 debt.


Well,
 this
 works
 until
 it
 doesn't


because
 if
 for
 some
 reason
 the
 business


changes
 or
 just
 slows
 its
 growth,
 which


could
 be
 just
 a
 natural
 evolution,
 like


part
 of
 this
 is
 the
 law
 of
 large


numbers.
 Okay?
 And
 if
 this
 happens,
 then


all
 of
 a
 sudden
 that
 debt
 doesn't
 go


away.
 And
 what
 looked
 like
 a
 very
 low


cost
 is
 now
 a
 meaningful
 cost
 that


doesn't
 leave.
 And
 I
 look
 at
 Apple
 and


this
 is
 what
 concerns
 me.
 Revenues


aren't
 growing


minimal.
 And
 yet
 it
 generates
 meaningful


cash
 because
 it
 has
 a
 brand.
 People
 are


still
 willing
 to
 pay
 $2,000
 for
 a
 new


phone.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 competitors


and
 I'm
 not
 sure
 that
 that
 will
 continue


forever
 at
 the
 same
 rate.
 In
 fact,
 it's


already
 slowing
 and
 that
 debt
 that


they've
 taken
 on
 to
 buy
 all
 back
 all


those
 shares
 to
 generate
 that
 EPS


growth,


>> that
 could
 end
 up
 being
 a
 problem
 if


they
 instead
 took
 that
 money
 and
 went


out
 and
 bought
 businesses,
 operating


businesses
 within
 its
 network
 that
 would


ensure
 its
 sustainability.
 and
 it's
 been


doing
 some
 of
 that,
 but
 continually
 do


that.


Imagine
 if
 it
 if
 it
 just
 kept
 the
 cash


and
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 a
 business
 that
 it


always
 wanted
 to
 buy
 suffered
 a
 bad


quarter
 and
 it
 bought
 it.
 It's
 very


difficult
 when
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 cash.


Cash
 is
 king.
 Cash
 is
 power.
 You
 know,


we've
 been
 talking
 and
 again
 it
 goes
 to


one
 of
 my
 rules
 about
 being
 negative


sounds
 smart.
 when
 if
 the
 market
 falls


uh
 or
 or
 suffers
 some
 kind
 of
 setback,


you
 shouldn't
 be
 concerned.
 You


shouldn't
 be
 you
 shouldn't
 be
 scared.
 In


fact,
 I
 I
 did
 a
 trip
 to
 China
 uh


life-changing
 practically
 earlier
 this


year.
 I'd
 never
 been
 before.
 And
 um
 when


I
 went
 to
 China,
 I
 if
 you
 go
 and
 in
 the


and
 I
 um
 met
 with
 analysts
 there
 and


taught
 them
 our
 our
 training
 process.


And
 if
 you
 when
 they
 when
 they
 look
 at


their
 screen,
 stocks
 that
 are
 down
 are


green,
 stocks
 that
 are
 up
 are
 red.


That's
 how
 you
 should
 rejig


screen.
 In
 fact,
 I
 called
 fact
 set
 in


and
 Bloomberg
 and
 see
 if
 we
 can
 change


that.
 Because
 if
 you
 look
 wake
 up
 every


day
 and
 everything's
 red
 and
 you
 like
 we


lived
 this
 in
 '08,
 right?
 It
 went
 lower


and
 you
 thought,
 "Okay,
 I'll
 buy
 some


now."
 And
 then
 it
 went
 lower
 two
 early


2000
 and
 then
 it
 went
 lower
 until
 you


don't
 know
 what
 that
 feels
 like
 until


you
 go
 through
 it.
 But
 imagine
 if
 every


day
 it
 was
 green.
 You
 go,
 "Oh,
 this
 is


interesting."


And
 if
 every
 day
 it
 was
 going
 up,
 it
 was


red.
 You'd
 go,
 "Hm,
 I'm
 not
 sure.
 Is


this
 okay?
 Is
 everything
 okay?
 It
 might


be,
 but
 it's
 just
 everything's
 a


mindset,
 right?
 They
 talk
 about,
 you


know,
 the
 uh
 habits,
 right?
 Developing


habits
 and
 that
 and
 of
 course
 that


famous
 book.
 I
 I
 I
 love
 that.
 And
 you


know,
 you
 you
 want
 to
 do
 small
 things,


right?
 Develop
 put
 your
 shoes
 over
 there


so
 you
 remember
 to
 put
 them
 on
 there
 and


then
 put
 beside
 the
 shoes
 something
 that


you
 need
 to
 shine
 the
 shoes
 right
 there.


That
 way
 you
 shine
 them
 before
 you


leave.
 Why
 do
 you
 think
 so
 few
 people


like
 everybody
 talks
 like
 Buffett
 and


then
 a
 situation
 like
 2008
 comes
 along


and
 people
 were
 paralyzed.


>> He
 had
 cash
 but
 he
 wasn't
 paralyzed.
 Why


could
 he
 act
 and
 other
 people
 to
 me
 it's


it's
 uh
 it's
 it's
 goes
 back
 to
 something


we've
 already
 touched
 on
 and
 that
 is
 the


natural
 agency
 issues
 related
 with
 money


management
 industry.
 my
 investors
 give


me
 their
 money
 so
 I
 can
 make
 a
 return


that
 is
 hopefully
 better
 then
 they
 could


make
 investing
 passively
 if
 it
 doesn't


end
 up
 being
 that
 they
 decide
 to
 take
 it


away
 from
 me


>> and
 then
 I
 don't
 have
 any
 money
 Buffett


has
 built
 a
 business
 that
 generates
 cash


so
 he
 has
 operating
 businesses
 Gecko


Pulum
 etc
 these
 generate
 cash
 he
 takes


that
 cash
 and
 invests
 it
 when
 he
 wants


to
 invest
 it
 in
 the
 way
 that
 he
 wants
 to


invest
 it.
 You
 know,
 the
 average


portfolio
 manager
 can't
 do
 that
 because


they're
 tied
 to
 they
 have
 to
 like
 today


in
 the
 investment
 management
 industry,


portfolio
 managers
 are
 measured
 like
 on


a
 daily
 basis
 there.
 If
 you're
 investing


in
 my
 funds,
 you
 can
 look
 right
 now
 and


see
 how
 we're
 doing
 versus
 the
 index


every
 second.


>> Yeah.


>> Why
 are
 you
 down
 today?
 My,
 you
 know,
 my


partner
 that
 started
 the
 business
 with


me
 says,
 "I
 don't
 know
 because
 there
 was


more
 sellers
 than
 buyers
 today."
 Yeah,


>> I
 don't
 know
 any
 number
 and
 and
 someone


that
 tells
 you
 they
 can
 phys
 know


exactly
 why
 unless
 there
 was
 some


announcement
 and
 even
 when
 there
 was
 an


announcement,
 it
 was
 the
 interpretation


of
 the
 announcement
 that
 led
 to
 the


stock
 price
 falling,
 not
 the


announcement
 itself.


>> One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we've
 sort
 of
 hit


on
 here
 without
 naming
 it
 is
 how


important
 structure
 is
 to
 investing.


Part
 of
 the
 reason
 that
 Berkshire
 was


able
 to
 do
 that
 and
 Buffett
 was
 able
 to


act
 is
 that
 or
 Buffett's
 able
 to
 do
 what


he's
 doing
 today
 is
 he
 controls
 so
 much


of
 the
 shares.
 So
 he's
 got
 the
 structure


to
 enable
 the
 strategy
 to
 play
 out.


Whereas
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it,
 you
 know,


there's
 many
 times
 during
 Brook


Birkshshire's


uh
 long
 career
 where
 an
 investor,
 an


activist
 investor
 would
 have
 come
 in,


demanded
 they
 return
 capital,
 demanded


they
 take
 on
 debt
 to
 buy
 back
 shares,


and
 the
 structure
 that's
 enabled
 so
 much


success
 has
 also
 prevented
 that.
 I
 I


think
 about
 structure
 a
 lot
 in
 terms
 of


not
 only
 being
 positioned
 so
 having
 cash


and
 you
 know
 being
 the
 master
 of
 your


own
 fate
 or
 what
 did
 Buffett
 say?
 I


never
 want
 to
 rely
 on
 the
 kindness
 of


strangers.


>> Yes.


>> Uh
 especially
 when
 I
 need
 them.


>> Yes.


>> And
 so
 like
 I
 think
 about
 that
 and
 I


think
 positioning.
 Anybody
 looks
 like
 a


genius
 when
 they're
 in
 a
 good
 position


and
 even
 a
 smart
 person
 looks
 like
 an


idiot
 when
 they're
 in
 a
 bad
 position.


>> Y


>> and
 then
 you
 think
 about
 structure
 and


how
 that
 aligns
 with
 the
 companies
 and


what
 you're
 trying
 to
 do.
 And
 you
 know


like
 it's
 similar
 to
 how
 I
 invest.
 I


don't
 have
 a
 fund.
 I
 don't
 have
 outside


investors.
 Why?
 Cuz
 I
 don't
 like
 that


structure.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 answer
 to


other
 people.
 I
 don't
 want
 to.
 And
 if
 I


want
 to
 save
 up
 money
 for
 3
 years
 and
 do


nothing,
 then
 I
 can
 do
 that.
 And
 if
 I


want
 to
 chuck
 80%
 of
 it
 into
 one


investment,
 I
 can
 do
 that.


>> Yes.


>> So
 the
 structure
 enables
 my
 style
 of
 how


I
 proceed
 with
 investing.
 And
 I
 think


that
 those
 are
 very
 underrated
 when
 we


think
 of
 public
 companies
 because
 you


have
 a
 time
 a
 structure
 mismatch.
 said


that's
 the
 first
 thing
 you
 look
 at
 is


the
 structure
 and
 the
 control


environment.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 you
 have
 shareholders
 who


have
 increasingly,
 you
 know,
 has
 gone


from
 years
 to
 probably


>> quarter
 seconds,
 whatever
 you
 want
 to


call
 it
 now.
 Uh
 the
 average
 CEO
 tenure


is
 is
 very
 short.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 and
 I
 I
 sort
 of
 like
 maybe
 the


analogy
 is
 bad,
 but
 I
 think
 about
 this


in
 the
 context
 of
 sports,
 right?
 Like
 if


I'm
 a
 head
 coach,
 I'm
 going
 into
 an
 0


and17
 team
 in
 the
 NFL.
 I'm
 going
 to
 take


risks
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 things
 that


may
 or
 may
 not
 work
 out.
 Uh
 but
 it's
 not


going
 to
 be
 status
 quo
 and
 I
 could
 leave


the
 situation
 worse
 than
 I
 found
 it.
 Uh


but
 what
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 do
 is
 just
 try


to
 make
 it
 incrementally
 better.


>> I
 I
 I
 think
 your
 analogy
 is
 fantastic


and
 it's
 and
 it's
 why,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 I I


played
 hockey
 and
 football
 in
 in in
 my


life
 and
 uh
 I
 I
 love
 hockey.
 uh
 you
 know


big
 huge
 league
 fan
 and
 watch
 uh
 watch


the
 games
 and
 so
 on
 but
 I
 watch
 more


NFL.
 I
 will
 watch
 teams
 that
 I
 have
 zero


interest
 in
 watching.
 Um
 and
 not
 because


of
 the
 not
 because
 the
 betting
 but


because
 any
 it's
 one
 game
 they
 only
 play


seven
 games.
 There
 is
 one
 semiinal
 game


>> and
 if
 they
 lose
 they're
 done.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 their
 career
 could
 be
 over
 because


the
 NFL
 career
 is
 so
 short.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 so
 whereas
 in
 hockey
 you


got
 seven
 games


>> like,
 "Okay
 guys,
 you
 know,
 second


period,
 we're
 down
 five.
 Okay,
 it's
 game


two.
 We're
 good.
 Okay,
 like
 we
 got
 this.


Settle
 down.
 Let's
 get
 ready.
 We
 play
 in


a
 couple
 of
 days."


>> So
 what
 I
 see
 happening
 in
 these


situations
 is
 like
 the
 new
 coach
 going


in
 to
 the
 bad
 team
 will
 overspend
 on


free
 agents.


>> Yep.


>> Uh
 they
 will
 leverage
 the
 future.
 Y


>> put
 themselves
 in
 a
 bad
 position
 salary


capwise
 in
 five
 years.
 Yep.


>> And
 it's
 almost
 under
 the
 assumption


that
 I'm
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the


coach
 in
 five
 years.
 Y


>> but
 this
 will
 make
 us
 immediately


better.
 I
 can
 show
 tangible
 progress
 and


I
 have
 a
 hope
 of
 but
 I've
 screwed
 myself


from
 year
 five
 to


>> 100%


>> you
 know
 forward.
 We
 talked
 about
 the


impact
 of
 passive
 investing.


I
 would
 say
 that
 passive
 investing
 has


always
 been
 there.
 Okay.
 Mhm.


>> What
 I
 think
 the
 more
 meaningful


important
 impact
 on
 investing
 today
 is


the
 power
 of
 the
 retail.
 I
 watched
 that


movie
 called
 Stupid
 Money
 was
 it
 called?


>> Uh
 with
 Hello
 Kitty
 and


>> Oh
 yeah.
 Yeah.
 That
 was
 great.


>> Um
 that
 is,
 you
 know,
 these
 are
 movies.


They're
 fantastic.


>> Yeah.


>> Because
 and
 the
 I
 love
 the
 word


fantastic.
 We
 haven't
 yet
 said
 it
 yet,


but
 because
 it's
 something
 supernatural.


It's
 something
 that
 is
 both
 good
 and
 bad


and
 it
 changed
 something.
 And
 so
 what


that
 really
 exposed
 is
 the
 power
 of
 the


retail
 investor.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 today
 the
 retail
 investor
 as
 a


component
 of
 total
 investment
 is
 the


largest
 it's
 ever
 been.
 And
 the
 other


thing
 that's
 interesting
 is
 that
 the


prevalence
 of
 all
 and
 how
 easy
 it
 is
 for


the
 retail
 investor
 to
 have
 just
 the


same
 information
 and
 maybe
 even
 better,


I
 don't
 know,
 but
 to
 have
 access
 to
 both


technical
 technical
 looking
 at
 charts,


fundamental
 looking
 at
 actual
 financial


information,
 social
 media
 stuff,
 access


to
 that
 in
 any
 way
 that
 I
 could
 get.


>> Yeah.
 at
 very
 low
 cost.
 So
 when
 I


started
 in
 the
 industry
 in
 1999,
 okay,


and
 this
 think
 of
 Buffett,
 he'll
 tell


you
 the
 story
 of
 he
 used
 to
 read
 the


financial
 statements
 and
 he
 used
 to
 get


the
 chart
 the
 old
 charts
 and
 look
 at


them
 and
 no
 one
 was
 doing
 that.


>> Yeah,


>> they
 weren't
 paying
 attention
 even
 even


investor
 in in
 institutional
 investors


and
 the
 retail
 investor
 was
 hardly


paying
 attention.
 We
 were
 just
 learning


on
 dialup.


>> Oh,
 I agree.
 And
 you
 could
 trade,
 but


you
 you'd
 have
 to
 call
 in
 your
 trade,


right,
 and
 wait
 in
 line
 for
 someone
 or


and
 then
 it
 started
 online,
 but
 it
 was


really
 slow
 and
 you
 didn't
 get
 good


information
 and
 you
 didn't
 get
 great


fills.
 Now
 you
 have
 interactive
 brokers.


That
 platform
 that
 you
 get
 is


unbelievable.
 And
 all
 the
 other
 all
 the


other
 com
 comparatives
 that
 are
 coming


up
 that's
 empowering
 that
 retail


investor.
 So
 this
 is
 creating
 a


significant
 short-term


focus.
 There
 are
 day
 options,
 okay,


traded
 all
 the
 time.
 Someone
 told
 me


that
 in
 Tesla
 there's
 more
 transactions


on
 options
 than
 there
 are
 in
 dollar


value
 on
 the
 actual
 stock
 in


>> Oh,
 interesting.
 The
 option
 market
 is
 we


could
 do
 a
 whole
 discussion


on
 all
 the
 subtleties
 of
 the
 stock


market
 that
 people
 don't
 know.
 When
 an


option
 is
 sold,
 someone
 has
 to
 sell
 it


to
 them.
 Well,
 that's
 typically
 the


broker,
 the
 market
 maker
 sells
 that


option.
 They
 try
 to
 sell
 it
 off
 to


somebody
 else,
 but
 if
 they
 can't
 get
 the


other
 side,
 well,
 then
 then
 they
 stuck


holding
 it.
 Now,
 most
 options
 expire


worthless
 until
 they
 don't.
 If
 something


actually
 happens
 and
 the
 price
 rises
 on


the
 stock
 and
 you've
 bought
 calls,
 now


the
 broker
 needs
 to
 sell
 like
 needs
 to


act
 to
 make
 that
 money
 to
 pay
 you
 for


that
 option.
 And
 typically,
 they're


going
 to
 start
 acting
 on
 the
 stock


itself
 to
 hedge
 themselves.


>> They'll
 buy
 the
 stock
 because
 if
 your


calls
 are
 going
 up
 and
 the
 stock
 because


the
 stock's
 going
 up,
 well,
 I
 want
 to


buy
 the
 stock
 so
 that
 I'm
 hedged
 as
 the


calls
 go
 up.
 I'm
 also
 hedged
 with
 the


stock
 price
 moving.
 Well,
 that
 just


creates
 more
 momentum
 for
 the
 stock


price
 to
 go
 higher.
 And
 so
 that
 is
 that


I
 think
 is
 also
 causing
 big
 swings.
 Like


you
 know,
 we're
 looking
 at
 on
 a
 daily


basis
 during
 earnings
 season
 stocks
 move


like
 it
 used
 to
 be
 1
 or
 2%.
 Now
 we're


looking
 at
 20%
 moves
 in
 a
 day.
 Oracle


moved
 20%.
 that
 was
 like
 on
 I
 don't


recall
 the
 exact
 number
 but
 that
 move


that
 those
 were
 valuations
 of
 entire


companies.


>> It
 was
 almost
 40%.


>> So
 you
 think
 about
 that
 and
 yet
 we're
 in


a
 period
 of
 AI.


>> Yeah.


>> We're
 in
 a
 period
 where
 there
 are
 drones


now
 for
 Oracle's
 business
 drones
 might


not
 help.
 But
 think
 about
 Lululemon


drones
 looking
 at
 at
 what's
 being
 sold,


what's
 being


where
 traffic
 is.
 you're
 you
 have
 access


and
 you
 can
 buy
 access
 to
 credit
 card


data.
 You
 can
 get
 you
 can
 talk
 to


suppliers.
 There's
 all
 these
 expert


networks
 that
 you
 can
 talk
 to
 like


individuals
 working
 in
 the
 industry
 or


used
 to
 work
 in
 the
 industry.
 They'll


give
 you
 all
 this
 inside
 but
 not
 inside


type
 information.
 And
 so
 yet
 all
 of
 that


is
 happening
 and
 Oracle
 stock
 price


moves
 40%


on
 news
 and
 we
 have
 access
 to
 better
 and


supposedly
 better
 information
 than
 we've


ever
 had.
 How
 does
 that
 make
 any
 sense?


If
 we
 had
 better
 information,
 then
 you


know what?
 Stock
 prices
 on
 news
 would


hardly
 move.
 Everybody
 would
 already


have
 known.


>> It'd
 be
 fully
 priced
 in.


>> Correct.
 So
 there
 in
 lies
 the


interesting
 point
 where
 you
 know
 they


think
 that
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 beat
 us
 as


investors.
 I
 say
 bring
 it.
 It's
 all


good.
 Bring
 it.


>> It's
 just
 a
 tool.
 We're
 still
 human.


It's
 a
 tool.
 It
 doesn't
 have
 judgment.


>> It
 doesn't
 have
 the
 ability
 to,
 you


know,
 make
 decisions
 on
 past
 links
 that


unless
 it
 unless
 that
 link
 that
 it
 drew,


but
 you
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 link
 it


drew.
 Well,
 as
 of
 today,
 I
 guess
 the
 the


potential
 is
 that
 it
 it
 supersedes


individual
 and
 collective
 intelligence


and
 so
 it
 gets
 to
 a
 point
 where
 it's


able
 to
 do
 that.
 I
 guess
 that's
 the


maybe


>> Yeah,
 we'll
 see.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 a
 great
 place
 to
 end
 this.


We
 always
 uh
 end
 with
 the
 same
 question,


which
 is
 a
 life
 question
 for
 you
 and
 a


personal
 question,
 but
 what
 is
 success


for
 you?
 Success
 is
 achieving
 something


that
 uh
 I
 can
 share
 with
 those
 that
 I


love
 and
 care
 about,
 my
 family
 and
 my


friends
 and
 my
 and
 my
 employees
 and
 and


and
 my
 customers.
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 the


success
 whether
 it's
 in
 sport.
 It's


achieving
 something
 that
 I
 can
 share.
 Um


because
 if
 I
 can't
 share
 it,
 you
 know,
 I


I
 I
 learned
 a
 quote
 long
 ago
 that
 uh


happiness
 can
 only
 be
 shared


>> from
 uh
 my
 late
 pastor
 priest
 uh
 Paul


Kuzzac.
 we'll
 give
 him
 a
 shout
 out.
 He


was
 awesome.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 can
 achieve


something
 and
 share
 it
 uh
 then
 it
 then


it's
 real
 success.
 And
 I
 think
 uh


winning
 has
 to
 be
 something
 that
 that
 is


everything.
 It
 has
 to
 it
 has
 to
 you
 have


to
 be
 focused
 on
 on
 achieving
 something


then
 nothing
 else
 can
 get
 in
 the
 way.


Big
 shout
 out
 to
 that
 book
 winning.
 Uh


I'm
 sure
 you
 looked
 at
 that
 book
 from
 uh


Tim
 Tim
 Grover.
 Uh
 that
 that's
 that's


such
 a
 pivotal
 study.
 This
 is
 a
 great


way
 to
 end
 this
 conversation.
 Thank
 you


so
 much,
 Anthony,
 for
 taking
 the
 time


today.


>> It's
 my
 pleasure,
 Shane.
