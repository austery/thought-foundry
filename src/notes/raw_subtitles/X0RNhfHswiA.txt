[Music]


hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tan
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 soone
 wealth
 fund
 and


today
 in
 good
 company
 we
 have
 a


tremendous
 guest
 MC
 Gladwell
 who
 has


refined
 the
 way
 we
 think
 about
 things


like
 success
 intuition
 and
 how
 I
 D


spread
 great
 to
 have
 you
 here
 Malcolm


wonderful
 glad
 to
 be
 here
 Malcolm
 what


are
 the
 most
 important
 things
 which
 have


changed
 in
 society
 over
 the
 last
 25


years
 oh
 wow
 I
 would
 turn
 the
 question


on
 its
 head
 and
 which
 is
 I
 think
 we


spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 talking
 about
 the


things
 that
 change
 and
 too
 little
 time


talking
 about
 things
 that
 haven't


changed
 I'm
 always
 you


know
 we've
 seen
 this
 sort
 of
 Advent
 of


this
 Avalanche
 of
 new
 technology
 and
 um


I'm
 always
 deeply
 impressed
 by
 how


little
 technology
 changes
 the
 way
 we


function
 as
 human
 beings
 we
 seem
 to
 be


and
 how
 we're
 always
 left
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 with
 some
 fairly
 difficult
 and


intractable
 human
 problems
 while


technology
 sails
 ahead
 and
 deals
 with


ever
 more
 sophisticated
 problems
 you


know
 it's
 it
 always
 comes
 back
 to
 the


same
 thing
 which
 is
 can
 we
 can
 human


beings
 find
 a
 way
 to
 cooperate
 with
 each


other
 in
 an
 efficient
 and
 um
 functional


way
 and
 that's
 been
 the
 problem
 for


thousands
 of
 years
 and
 it
 doesn't
 seem


to
 get
 any
 easier
 despite
 the
 fact
 that


we're
 surrounded
 with
 ever
 more


sophisticated
 tools
 for
 trying
 to
 make


that
 happen
 and
 why
 is
 that
 because
 I


think
 it's
 funny
 because
 sometimes
 I


meet
 with
 companies
 and
 I
 ask
 them
 what


kind
 of
 problems
 do
 you
 have
 and
 they


all
 talk
 about
 you
 know
 well
 we're


trying
 to
 to
 build
 down
 the
 silos
 we're


trying
 to
 get
 cooperation
 up
 uh
 we're


trying
 to
 get
 people
 to


share
 uh
 trust
 each
 other
 more
 uh
 feel


safer
 and
 so
 on
 um
 seems
 like
 it's
 the


same
 problem
 everywhere
 and
 and
 been
 the


same
 problem
 I'm
 sure
 had
 you
 at
 the


conversation
 50
 years
 ago
 you
 would
 have


heard
 a
 version
 of
 the
 same
 thing


different


buzzwords
 but
 people
 coming
 back
 to
 the


same
 fundamental
 questions
 um
 we're
 I


mean
 a
 couple
 you
 know
 million
 years
 of


human
 evolution
 is
 a
 lot
 more
 powerful


force
 than
 uh
 a
 couple
 hundred
 years
 of


technological
 advance
 I
 think
 that's


probably
 what
 we're
 talking
 about
 here


there's
 an
 imbalance
 between
 um
 those


two
 processes
 what
 is
 the
 most
 uh


interesting
 technology
 change
 you
 are


seeing
 now
 um
 I
 mean
 the
 obvious
 answer


is
 AI
 um
 uh
 although
 um
 I
 mean
 can
 I


answer
 a
 slightly
 different
 question
 the


the
 single
 most
 I
 think
 issue
 change
 in


the
 in
 the
 western
 developed
 world
 is


demographic
 it
 is
 the
 aing
 Aging
 of
 the


population
 which
 I
 think
 impacts
 the
 way


in
 which
 all
 kinds
 of
 other


technological
 innovations
 are
 used
 so


that
 you
 know
 we
 are
 profoundly
 older


than
 we
 were
 50
 years
 ago
 had
 AI
 come


along
 50
 years
 ago
 I
 think
 he
 would
 have


seen
 a
 very
 very
 different
 pattern
 of


adoption
 than
 you
 would
 see
 now
 so
 if


you
 go
 back
 to
 to
 the
 beginning
 of
 the


baby
 boom
 where
 you
 have
 across
 the
 West


an
 extraordinarily
 large
 generation
 of


people
 entering
 professions
 for
 the


first
 time
 um
 and
 that
 was
 a
 when
 those


moments
 happen
 those
 demographic
 moments


you
 have
 an
 opportunity
 to
 change
 the


patterns
 of
 practice
 because
 patterns
 of


practice
 in
 any
 domain
 are
 obviously


heavily
 kind
 of
 specific
 to
 Generations


we
 don't
 have
 that
 now
 so
 instead
 of


having
 a
 new
 generation
 embracing
 a


technology
 and
 bringing
 it
 to
 the


profession
 where're
 faced
 with
 a
 task
 of


converting
 existing
 professional
 domains


to
 new
 habits
 of
 practice
 that's
 not


impossible
 it's
 just
 harder
 so
 you
 think


when
 we
 get
 older
 we're
 a
 bit
 beyond


repair
 not
 Beyond
 repair
 I
 just


think
 making
 an
 argument
 to
 a


55-year-old
 doctor
 that
 they
 should
 seed


some
 enormous
 share
 of
 their
 diagnostic


Behavior
 to
 AI
 is
 so
 much
 harder
 than
 it


is
 if
 you're
 telling
 it
 to
 someone
 who's


in
 medical
 school
 H
 and
 not
 and
 for
 good


reasons
 why
 would
 they
 change
 their


patterns
 of
 practice
 are
 set
 there's
 no


threat
 to
 their
 the
 way
 they
 do
 business


their
 everything
 about
 the
 new


technology
 strikes
 them
 as
 being
 um


profoundly
 upsetting
 I've
 seen
 some
 of


the
 data
 from
 these
 experiments
 where


they
 try
 and
 get
 doctors
 to
 adopt
 Ai
 and


what
 you
 see
 is
 there's
 no
 question
 the


AI
 is
 better
 than
 them
 when
 they
 have
 a


chance
 to
 use
 AI
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 use


it
 and
 the
 main
 objection
 is
 it
 takes


away
 essentially
 it
 takes
 away
 the
 fun


of
 practicing
 medicine
 but
 Co
 um
 really


changed
 the
 technology
 uptake
 I
 think


that's
 right
 yeah
 that's
 a
 kind
 of


exogenous
 shock
 to
 the
 system
 that
 has


that
 allows
 for
 uh
 this
 kind
 of
 uh


dramatic
 technology
 adoption
 you
 in
 a


way
 um
 invented
 the
 concept
 of
 Tipping


Point
 what
 type
 of
 tipping
 points
 are


you
 seeing
 now
 I
 do
 think
 if
 I
 want
 to


come
 back
 to
 this
 demographic
 thing
 I


actually
 think
 we
 don't
 spend
 enough


time
 on
 this
 in
 the
 United
 States
 for


example
 College
 age
 population
 the


number
 of
 kids
 applying
 to
 college
 is


plummeting
 um
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 most


dramatic
 shifts
 that
 we've
 seen
 in


generations
 and
 I
 really
 think
 that's


important
 and
 I
 cannot
 tell
 you
 why
 it's


important
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 know
 yet
 but


I
 really
 do
 think
 there's
 something


that's
 you
 know
 that
 could
 be
 a
 good


thing
 it
 could
 facilitate
 the


introduction
 of
 new
 kinds
 of
 kind
 of


cognitive
 Technologies
 like
 AI
 because


we
 simply
 have
 a
 smaller
 code
 of
 people


who
 are
 competing
 for
 them
 um
 it


dramatically
 changes
 the
 kind
 of
 social


balance
 of
 power
 within
 industrialized


societies
 if
 that
 sector
 of
 the


population
 is
 shrinking
 I
 don't
 know


it's
 just
 but
 it
 strikes
 me
 that
 we've


been
 living
 in
 a
 world
 where
 we
 have


been
 steadily
 expanding
 the
 number
 of


college
 educated
 people
 for
 150
 years


and
 that
 may
 be
 coming
 to
 an
 end
 and


that's
 weird
 well
 if
 you
 think
 it's


weird
 in
 the
 states
 I
 mean
 Europe
 looks


much
 worse
 right
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


demographics
 in
 Europe
 and
 um
 I
 just


spent
 a
 month
 in
 New
 York
 meeting
 well


altogether
 uh
 more
 than
 50
 American


cosos
 and
 the
 first
 time
 I've
 heard
 them


talk
 about
 declining
 demographies
 in
 uh


in
 Europe
 and
 that
 therefore
 they


weren't
 putting
 their
 best
 people


elsewhere
 demographic
 Trends
 to
 my
 mind


will
 always
 Trump
 technological
 Trends


in
 terms
 of
 their
 kind
 of
 seismic


significance
 um
 because
 they
 go
 to
 the


core
 of
 who
 we
 are
 right
 they're
 um


there
 are
 you
 know
 uh
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 so


I
 think
 yeah
 that
 would
 to
 my
 mind


that's
 really
 really
 uh
 an
 important


change
 moving
 on
 a
 bit
 to
 Evolution
 and


learning
 you
 um
 have
 argued
 that
 being


open
 to
 correction
 builds
 trust
 and


credibility
 why
 is
 it
 so
 hard
 for


leaders
 to
 admit
 they're
 wrong
 because


they're
 confusing
 two
 things
 I
 think


that
 um
 they're


confusing
 um
 admitting
 you
 wrong
 about


your
 ideas
 and
 admitting
 you
 you
 you


were
 wrong


um
 admitting
 to
 a
 kind
 of
 moral
 failing


I
 do
 think
 admitting
 to
 a
 moral
 failing


is
 something
 that
 is
 fundamentally


damaging
 I
 don't
 think
 your
 colleagues


um
 uh
 will
 forgive
 you
 easily
 or
 move
 on


quickly
 from
 the
 knowledge
 that
 you
 have


done
 that
 you
 have
 revealed
 some


fundamental
 flaw
 in
 character
 but


admitting
 that
 you
 were
 wrong
 about
 a


Mis
 about
 an
 idea
 or
 an
 action
 unless


you
 understand
 the
 nature
 of
 your


mistake
 and
 are
 endeavoring
 to
 do


something
 about
 it
 strengthens
 my
 belief


in
 you
 as
 a
 leader
 it
 makes
 me
 uh
 think


that
 you
 are
 someone
 who's
 better


adapted
 to
 a
 fast
 changing
 world
 then


and
 also
 it
 makes
 me
 feel
 better
 as
 a


employee
 because
 I
 understand
 that
 this


is
 an
 environment
 that
 doesn't
 penalize


um
 risk-taking
 or
 um
 and
 I
 think
 people


confuse
 those
 two
 you
 have
 revised
 some


of
 your
 uh
 pretty
 strongly
 held


positions
 what
 what
 type
 of
 things
 have


you
 revised
 the
 biggest
 example
 would
 be


about
 around
 crime
 I
 mean
 I've
 returned


to
 crime
 in
 almost
 every
 one
 of
 my
 books


and
 if
 you
 read
 all
 of
 them
 um
 starting


with
 a
 Tipping
 Point
 25
 years
 ago
 um


through
 to
 my
 last
 book
 you
 uh
 you
 will


see
 that
 I
 have
 been
 returning
 it
 and


essentially
 more
 than
 updating
 it
 in


some
 way
 and
 now
 to
 the
 point
 where
 I


think
 that
 the
 way
 I
 talked
 about
 crime


in
 my
 first
 book
 was
 simply
 wrong
 why


were
 you
 fascinated
 by
 crime
 in
 the


first
 place
 well
 I
 was
 living
 in
 New


York
 at
 the
 time
 when
 New
 York
 City


under
 in
 the
 in
 the
 early
 90s
 when
 it


underwent
 this
 very
 very
 sudden


reduction
 in
 crime
 um
 as
 did
 many


American
 cities
 but
 New
 York
 was
 the


leader
 and
 then
 New
 York
 went
 underwent


a
 second
 declining
 crime
 which
 was


unique
 to
 New
 York
 and
 I
 just


simply
 I
 found
 it
 so
 fascinating
 and
 no


one
 could
 give
 me
 a
 good
 explanation
 for


why
 which
 is
 that's
 why
 I
 wrote
 my
 first


book
 was
 to
 try
 and
 kind
 of
 wrap
 my


hands
 around
 the
 phenomenon
 of
 how
 is
 it


possible
 that
 a
 city
 could
 go
 from
 being


thought
 of
 as
 one
 of
 the
 most
 dangerous


urban
 areas
 in
 the
 west
 to
 a
 place
 now
 I


mean
 New
 York
 is
 basically
 on
 par
 with


Paris
 in
 many
 in
 many
 respects
 as
 a
 in


terms
 of
 its
 crime
 rate
 which
 is
 you


know
 if
 I
 said
 that
 to
 you
 Nikolai
 in


1990
 you
 would
 have
 said
 I
 was
 crazy
 I


mean
 in
 our
 lifetime
 absolutely
 um
 how


has
 your
 view


changed
 I
 become
 um
 well
 mostly
 because


an
 idea
 that
 I
 I
 sort
 of
 played
 with
 in


my
 first
 book
 which
 I
 returned
 to
 much


more
 strongly
 in
 my
 most
 recent
 book
 I'm


more
 and
 more
 and
 more
 and
 more


impressed
 by
 the
 fundamental
 asymmetry


of
 human
 behavior
 and
 I
 didn't
 fully


think
 through
 the
 implications
 of
 this


um
 in
 my
 first
 book
 in
 my
 first
 book
 I
 I


celebrated
 a
 theory
 of
 crime
 reduction


that
 said
 that
 what
 what
 we
 want
 is
 uh


more
 police
 more
 proactive
 police


presence
 in
 other
 words
 send
 police
 out


into
 the
 community
 and
 have
 them
 very


aggressively
 uh
 take
 note
 of
 and
 correct


small
 instances
 of
 disorder
 because
 in


doing
 that
 they
 will
 send
 a
 message
 that


large
 kinds
 of
 disorder
 are
 um
 are


impermissible
 what
 I
 what
 I
 would
 I
 what


what
 we
 realize
 now
 what
 the


criminological
 world
 has
 kind
 of


realized
 now
 is
 that
 that's
 not
 the
 way


crime
 Works
 crime
 is
 not
 something


embedded
 broadly
 in
 the
 community
 crime


is
 something
 that
 is
 um
 uh
 generated
 and


sustained
 by
 a
 tiny
 tiny
 tiny
 fraction


of
 the
 population
 and
 if
 you
 can
 find


that
 fraction
 you
 can
 create
 highly


effective
 policing
 that
 is
 both
 limited


um
 that
 is
 that
 is
 profoundly
 limited


that
 is
 just
 targeted
 and
 limited
 to
 to


um
 so
 we're
 talking
 in
 New
 York
 City


we're
 talking
 about
 a
 couple
 of
 thousand


people
 who
 are
 probably
 at
 the
 core
 of


the
 crime
 epidemic
 and
 this
 is
 in
 a
 city


of
 nine
 million
 people
 that
 is
 something


that


uh
 no
 it
 did
 not
 occur
 to
 anyone
 in
 in


the
 90s
 and
 what
 what
 are
 the


implications
 for
 this
 the
 implications


are
 that
 uh
 so
 there's
 two
 Dimensions
 to


this
 one
 I
 wrote
 about
 in
 my
 last
 book


and
 one
 in
 this
 book
 one
 is
 that
 it
 is


spatially
 specific
 that
 if
 you
 look
 at


any
 and
 any
 urban
 area
 in
 the
 world
 and


look
 at
 patterns
 of
 crime
 you
 will
 find


that
 they
 are
 specific
 to
 Street


segments
 so
 blocks
 city
 blocks
 and
 that


those
 that
 specificity
 is
 um
 has
 a
 kind


of
 permanence
 in
 other
 words
 if
 I
 return


to
 Oso
 10
 years
 from
 now
 I
 will
 find


crime
 occurring
 on
 the
 same
 street


corners
 today
 as
 I
 did
 10
 years
 ago


that's
 one
 and
 secondly
 that
 it's
 um
 is


demog
 it's
 that
 it
 is
 um
 well


demographically
 specific
 that
 it
 is


certain
 individuals
 in
 certain
 age


cohorts
 who
 are
 in
 certain
 um
 within


certain
 social
 networks
 that
 are
 are


responsible
 overwhelmingly
 for


sustaining
 criminal
 activity
 and
 so
 if


you
 if
 you
 can
 paint
 a
 picture
 of
 that


Network
 and
 look
 at
 the
 core
 of
 that


Network
 you
 can
 instead
 of
 instead
 of


trying
 to
 track
 a
 thousand
 people
 you


can
 track
 10
 and
 that
 is
 I
 mean
 a
 a
 kind


of
 that
 is
 so
 distant
 from
 what
 we


thought
 the
 job
 of
 a
 police
 force
 was
 25


years
 ago
 I
 mean
 it's
 night
 and
 day
 it's


like
 it's
 precision
 it's
 the
 difference


between
 you


know
 you
 know
 in


chemotherapy
 in
 the
 50s
 you
 attacked
 the


whole
 body
 and
 now
 you
 you
 detect
 some


tiny
 portion
 of
 the
 tumor
 it's
 the
 same


it's
 the
 same
 analogy
 interesting


different
 type
 of
 social
 network
 is
 uh


we
 find
 in


sports
 and
 um
 you
 you
 say
 that
 failure


and
 mediocracy
 in
 sport
 can
 teach
 us
 a


lot
 so
 what
 are
 your
 thoughts
 there
 you


were
 a
 previous
 Runner
 you
 still
 run


yeah
 but
 yeah
 you
 ran
 faster
 in
 the
 past


of
 course
 yes
 I
 did
 as
 do
 as
 do
 we
 all


yeah
 um
 well
 you
 know
 it's
 funny


I
 I
 have
 many
 feelings
 about
 sports
 and


I
 it
 took
 me
 a
 long
 time
 but
 I
 I
 came
 to


the
 I
 I
 listened
 to
 to
 too
 many


CEOs
 so
 many
 cosos
 or
 people
 who
 people


running
 companies
 told
 me
 that
 they
 like


to
 hire
 former
 athletes
 and
 for
 a
 long


time
 I
 dismissed
 this
 and
 then
 I


realized
 there
 must
 be
 something
 there


that
 there
 must
 be
 picking
 up
 on
 there


must
 be
 something
 specific
 that
 is


taught
 in
 sports
 more
 effectively
 that's


taught
 in
 other
 domains
 When
 We're
 Young


um
 but
 the
 second
 question
 is
 is
 the


thing
 that's
 being
 taught
 in
 sports


specific
 to
 being
 good
 at
 them
 or
 is
 it


just
 specific
 to
 participating
 in
 them


in
 other
 words
 to
 benefit
 from
 whatever


good
 is
 coming
 out
 of
 being
 a


long-distance
 Runner
 do
 you
 need
 to
 be


in
 inab
 britson
 or
 can
 you
 be
 Malcolm


Gladwell
 coming
 somewhere
 in
 the
 middle


of
 the
 back
 um
 and
 the
 answer
 is
 I
 I'm


now
 convinced
 that
 there
 may
 be
 as
 many


if
 not
 more
 gains
 to


being
 good
 or
 mediocre
 as
 opposed
 to


being
 very
 good
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 want


to
 be
 the
 um
 and
 I
 think
 we
 get
 you
 know


the
 the
 you
 know
 for
 among
 reasons
 the


time
 costs
 of
 being
 exceptional
 are
 so


large
 that
 they
 crowd
 out
 other
 kinds
 of


of
 knowledge
 and
 skill
 acquisition
 what


you
 want
 to
 be
 is
 someone
 who
 is
 simply


um
 acquiring
 the
 kind
 of
 discipline
 and


thought
 processes
 that
 come
 from


participation
 in
 a
 sport
 without
 being


overwhelmed
 by
 it
 so
 if
 if
 I'm
 mediocre


in
 sport
 what
 is
 it
 that
 I
 gain
 from
 it


well
 if
 you're
 mediocre
 because
 you


don't
 train
 very
 hard
 you're
 not
 getting


no
 I'm
 training
 so
 let's
 say
 I'm


training
 hard
 I'm
 getting
 up
 early
 I'm


going
 for
 it
 but
 hey
 I'm
 just
 too
 fat
 I


don't
 move
 fast
 enough
 and
 I
 think
 and
 I


I
 would
 further
 if
 I
 was
 someone
 who
 was


hiring
 find
 it
 impressive
 that
 you


persisted
 even
 though
 you
 were
 mediocre


in
 other
 words
 the
 idea
 that
 somebody


could
 devote
 a
 large
 amount
 of
 their


time
 and
 attention
 to
 something
 um
 and


be
 comfortable
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 they


weren't
 that
 wasn't
 being
 that
 wasn't


receiving
 an
 immediate
 reward
 is


interesting
 to
 me
 right
 that
 they're


that
 they
 have
 other
 words
 an
 attraction


to
 um
 first
 of
 all
 they
 have
 a
 a
 self-de


of
 success
 not
 one
 that's
 externally


constructed
 and
 two
 that
 they're
 happy


to
 persist
 in
 an
 activity
 even
 though


the
 world
 doesn't
 recognize
 their


persistence
 in
 some
 tangible
 form
 that's


really
 really
 crucial
 right
 I'm
 what
 I'm


interested
 in
 is
 the
 extent
 to
 which


somebody
 is
 is
 their
 motivation
 is
 is


self-generated
 That's
 The
 crucial
 thing


well
 I
 we
 we
 certainly
 see
 uh
 more
 grit


uh
 more
 working
 on
 process
 focus
 on


process
 rather
 than
 results
 a
 lot
 of
 uh


you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 Team
 uh
 spirit
 and


work
 coming
 out
 of
 it
 a
 lot
 of
 positive


things
 how
 has
 your
 background
 in
 sport


helped
 form
 you
 well
 um
 many
 ways
 um
 I


do
 think
 it
 teaches
 it
 taught
 me
 as
 a
 at


a
 very


young
 age
 I
 was
 a
 big
 high
 school
 Runner


um
 uh
 the
 distance
 between
 preparation


and
 reward
 in
 sports
 is
 one
 of
 the
 key


lessons
 you
 know
 there's
 no
 such
 thing


as
 instant
 gratification
 and
 that's
 for


a
 13-year-old
 is
 a
 really
 really
 really


important
 idea
 and
 to
 lay
 down
 the


notion
 at
 13
 that
 it
 is
 October
 and


we're
 going
 to
 go
 for
 a
 10
 mile
 run
 and


you
 will
 not
 see
 the
 results
 of
 this


until
 you
 race
 in
 May
 is
 really
 really


useful
 at
 that
 age
 I
 mean
 it's
 useful
 at


61
 too
 but
 um
 to
 to
 have
 that
 lesson
 um


and
 the
 second
 thing
 that
 um
 how
 well


you
 do
 is
 a
 function
 not
 of
 not
 just
 of


the
 intensity
 of
 your
 effort
 but
 more


importantly
 of
 the
 consistency
 of
 your


effort
 um
 is
 another
 really
 really


important
 you
 know
 when
 I
 look
 at
 my


college
 Years
 and
 even
 my
 professional


years
 I
 am
 not
 someone
 who
 ever
 does


anything
 at
 the
 last
 moment
 never
 do
 I


never
 stay
 up
 all
 night
 I
 never
 I
 never


work
 past
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 work
 in
 the


evenings
 I
 don't
 I
 meet
 I
 meet
 deadlines


why
 do
 I
 meet
 deadlines
 that's
 a
 very


runnner
 kind
 of
 thing
 to
 do
 there's
 no


such
 thing
 as
 last
 minute
 preparation
 in


fact
 the
 opposite
 is
 true
 if
 you're


you're
 supposed
 to
 do
 nothing
 at
 the


very
 very
 at
 the
 very
 very
 end
 before


cor
 race
 so
 like
 those
 are
 all
 kinds
 of


um
 you
 know
 foundational
 ideas
 for
 uh


for
 an
 adolescent
 to
 kind
 of
 to
 be


introduced
 to
 and
 the
 third
 thing
 is


this
 intensity
 consistency
 thing
 is


something
 that
 only
 recently
 I've
 I've


dwell
 a
 lot
 on
 and
 I
 I've
 been
 struck
 by


how
 many
 successful
 people
 I
 know
 are


people
 who
 value
 consistency
 over


intensity
 um
 that
 this
 idea
 that
 you
 get


up
 every
 day
 and
 you
 do
 something
 and


that
 that
 is
 a
 far
 better
 way
 of


succeeding
 than


concentrating
 um
 doing
 these
 bursts
 of


kind
 of
 um
 hyperkinetic
 activity
 which


exhausts
 you
 and
 which
 give
 you
 very


little
 time
 for
 reflection
 um
 the
 thing


about
 consistency
 is
 it
 allows
 for
 it


gives
 you
 space
 to
 reflect
 um
 and
 I
 a


lot
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 one
 of
 the


strategies
 that
 I've
 tried
 to
 follow
 in


my
 work
 is
 trying
 to
 build
 uh
 space
 for


reflection
 into
 creative
 Cycles
 you
 know


start
 early
 enough
 that
 I
 have
 the
 time


to
 kind
 of
 put
 something
 aside
 and
 come


back
 to
 it
 and
 that
 allows
 you
 gives
 you


so
 much
 more
 insight
 into
 what
 into


what's
 wrong
 with
 what
 you're
 doing
 how


do
 you
 do
 that
 start
 earlier
 and
 do


again
 it's
 the
 consistency
 better
 to
 do


two
 hours
 a
 day
 you
 know
 starting
 six


months
 early
 than
 to
 do
 six
 hours
 a
 day


starting
 one
 month
 early
 yeah
 a
 couple


of
 things
 I
 mean
 one
 is
 uh
 consistency


builds
 trust
 and
 we
 even
 see
 it
 in


investment
 results
 you
 know
 a
 consistent


track
 record
 is
 much
 better
 than
 a
 more


volatile
 track
 record
 it's
 perceived
 as


more
 trustworthy
 but
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 the


your
 disbelief
 in
 procrastination
 uh
 we


have
 other
 thinkers
 such
 as
 Adam
 Grant


who
 is
 advocating
 for


procrastination
 why
 uh
 why
 could
 you


elaborate
 a
 bit
 on
 that
 well
 I
 don't
 uh


to
 be
 fair
 I'm
 just
 I'm
 describing
 my


own
 approach
 and
 why
 I
 think
 there
 may


be
 benefits
 to
 someone
 engaging
 in
 the


kind
 of
 sporting
 activity
 I'm
 not
 saying


this
 is
 true
 for
 all
 people
 or
 all


domains
 um
 and
 uh
 uh
 there's
 certainly
 a


case
 there's
 you
 know
 the
 the
 lovely
 way


about
 the
 way
 human
 beings
 operate
 is


that
 there
 are
 many
 many
 different
 ways


of
 solving
 a
 problem
 um
 I
 I
 think
 there


I'm
 I'm
 describing
 one
 particularly


fruitful
 Avenue
 now
 you
 uh
 identify
 as


an
 introvert
 what
 have
 you
 learned
 about


introverts
 approach
 to
 challenges
 I
 mean


are
 you
 really
 an
 introvert
 or
 are
 you


just
 saying
 it
 well
 well
 I
 uh
 the


introvert
 is
 someone
 uh
 who
 is
 um
 not


hostile
 to
 social
 interaction
 on
 the


contrary
 they
 we
 can
 be
 we
 can
 be


inspired
 by
 it
 thrilled
 by
 it
 love


performing
 but
 someone
 for
 whom
 social


interaction
 is


costly
 um
 so
 I
 am
 someone
 who's
 I
 I
 do
 I


enjoy
 this
 conversation
 I
 enjoy


interviewing
 people
 I
 enjoy
 giving
 talks


but
 it's
 costly
 it
 in
 other
 words
 it


does
 not
 invigorate
 me
 it
 drains
 me
 um


thanks
 so
 that
 that
 just
 means
 that
 we


because
 we
 regard
 those
 activity
 we


understand
 those
 activities
 to
 be
 costly


we
 ration


them
 like
 you
 would
 in
 any
 whereas
 the


extrovert
 does
 not
 does
 not
 ration
 those


things
 I
 I
 watched
 once
 watched
 Bill


Clinton
 work
 a
 room
 he's
 the
 he's
 the


quintessential
 extrovert
 he
 is
 in
 so


invigorated
 by
 meeting
 people
 that
 he


will
 do
 it
 indefinitely
 I
 mean
 he
 he


would
 stay
 in
 that
 room
 for
 hours
 if
 he


had
 the
 chance
 that's
 not
 what
 the


introvert
 is
 so
 I
 suppose
 you
 know
 do
 I


think
 there's
 something
 I
 don't
 have
 a


kind
 of
 preference
 for
 I
 don't
 think
 one


mode
 is
 superior
 to
 the
 other
 it's
 just


a
 kind
 of
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 it's
 the
 it's
 I


if
 I
 I
 and
 I
 find
 I
 find
 the
 classic


extrovert
 position
 that
 interaction
 is


invigorating
 I
 find
 it
 deeply
 mystifying


I
 don't
 understand
 how
 that's
 possible


but
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a
 bad
 thing
 I


just
 think
 it's
 a
 it's
 just
 a
 kind
 of


foreign
 activity


where
 does
 extroversion
 come
 from
 well


these
 seem
 to
 be
 of
 the
 kind
 of
 Big
 Five


personality
 traits
 introversion
 and


extroversion
 are
 the
 most
 genetically


determined
 right
 so
 conscientiousness


would
 be
 um
 the
 least
 oh
 no
 motivation


we
 know
 that
 motivation
 seems
 to
 be
 the


least
 um
 and
 conscientiousness
 seem
 to


be
 the
 least
 genetically
 determined
 and


extroversion
 introversion
 seem
 to
 be
 the


most
 so
 I
 it's
 purely
 kind
 of
 um
 baked


into
 our
 systems
 because
 I've
 been


thinking
 quite
 a
 bit
 about
 energy
 where


does
 energy
 come
 from
 and
 how
 do
 we
 how


do
 we
 measure
 it
 and
 how
 important
 is
 it


yeah
 is
 that
 the
 same
 is
 extroversion


the
 same
 as
 energy
 or
 is
 it
 different
 no


uh
 I
 think
 energy
 I
 I
 lump
 enine
 in
 my


mind
 with


enthusiasm
 um
 and
 that
 the
 person
 who
 is


energetic
 is
 typically
 the
 person
 who


has
 simply
 done
 a
 better
 job
 of
 finding


the
 thing
 that
 gives
 them
 pleasure
 and


excitement


um
 that
 um
 and
 that
 in
 the
 that
 once
 you


found
 that
 most
 of
 us
 are
 uh
 energetic


but
 the
 problem
 is
 that
 most
 of
 us


haven't
 found
 it
 so
 when
 we
 observe
 in


the
 like
 when
 I
 said
 earlier
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 Big
 Five
 personality
 traits
 you


know
 introversion
 extroversion


conscientiousness
 openness
 to
 experience


neuroticism
 um
 agreeableness
 the
 one


that
 is
 the
 least
 genetically
 determined


is


conscientiousness
 so
 the
 things
 that


make
 the
 the
 cluster
 of
 traits
 that


surround
 motivation
 and
 the
 question
 is


why
 would
 that
 be
 so
 what
 is
 the
 what
 is


the
 environment
 doing
 there
 in
 a
 way


that
 it's
 not
 doing
 when
 it
 comes
 to


extroversion
 introversion
 and
 the
 answer


is
 that
 um
 for
 us
 to
 express
 our


motivation
 we
 need
 to
 externally
 come


upon
 something
 worthy
 of
 our
 time


attention
 I
 say
 enthusiasm
 because


that's
 the
 way
 it
 um
 now
 and
 to
 the
 ex


that
 it
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 or
 some
 it
 it
 is


genetically
 mediated
 it's
 that
 some


people
 are
 just
 look
 harder
 or
 are
 much


more
 inclined
 to
 find
 things
 um
 uh
 that


that
 excite
 their
 enthusiasm
 so
 you
 know


when
 I
 when
 we
 when
 we
 hire
 people
 when


I
 hire
 people
 I'm
 very
 interested
 in


this
 trade
 and
 I
 I
 like
 I
 like
 the


person
 who
 can
 find
 pleasure
 and
 joy
 in


very
 very
 small
 things
 because
 it


strikes
 me
 that
 oh
 that
 person
 is
 going


to
 be
 be
 easy
 to
 motivate
 right
 there're


but
 the
 person
 who's
 very
 very
 very
 very


particular
 um
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 harder
 um


he
 gonna
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 harder
 to
 to


keep
 them
 um
 focused
 how
 do
 you
 tease


tease
 this
 out
 in
 an
 interview
 no
 idea
 I


mean
 I
 have
 some
 ideas
 I
 think
 we're
 all


very
 you
 know
 the
 truth
 is
 there's


almost
 nothing
 we
 do
 worse
 than
 um


assess
 someone's
 personality
 in
 a
 short


period
 of
 time
 right
 it's
 like
 it's
 just


we're
 uniformly
 bad
 at
 it
 when
 we
 do
 it


we
 tend
 to
 do
 it
 badly
 we
 tend
 to
 be


misled
 by
 all
 kinds
 of
 things
 um
 you


know
 uh
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 any
 kind


of
 um
 there
 is
 any
 kind
 of
 uh
 substitute


for
 uh
 substituting
 some
 longer


interaction
 or
 for
 you
 know
 the
 as


journalists
 we
 always
 we
 you
 know


there's
 a
 a
 very
 standard
 thought


experiment
 that
 a
 journalist
 has
 um
 so


Nichol
 I
 suppose
 I
 was
 assigned
 to
 write


a
 long
 10,000w
 profile
 of
 you
 and
 I
 was


given
 two
 conditions
 you
 can
 have


unlimited
 access
 to
 Nikolai
 or
 you
 can


have
 unlimited
 access
 to
 everyone
 in


nikolai's
 life
 which
 do
 you
 choose
 the


good
 journalist
 would
 always
 choose
 the


latter
 that
 I
 feel
 I
 can
 get
 further
 in


understanding
 you
 if
 I
 had
 unlimited


access
 to
 all
 the
 people
 around
 you
 even


if
 it
 meant
 I
 could
 never
 talk
 to
 you
 um


then
 the
 reverse
 um
 that's
 not
 because


you
 will
 mislead
 me
 but
 just
 because


there
 are
 real
 limits
 to
 the
 extent
 to


which
 I
 can
 accurately
 gauge
 who
 you
 are


from
 your
 own
 self-presentation
 right


there's
 just
 too
 many
 defenses
 too
 many


and
 too
 many
 things
 about
 which
 you
 like


all
 of
 us
 are
 unavoidably
 subjective
 you


you
 know
 we're
 just
 poor
 judges
 of


ourselves
 so
 I
 I
 would
 do
 better
 if
 I


could
 get
 your
 you
 know
 spouse
 mother


sibling
 cooworker
 best
 friend
 that's


just
 going
 to
 be
 way
 more
 useful
 why
 do


people
 at
 the
 top
 complain
 more
 than


others
 no
 this
 is
 I
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the


Mysteries
 so
 I
 have
 there
 are
 many


Mysteries
 that
 that
 I
 that
 I
 find
 with


uh
 with
 wealth
 um
 the
 there
 are
 several


wealth
 paradoxes
 one
 is
 the
 wealthy


should
 logically
 complain
 less
 about


taxes
 and
 be
 less
 sensitive
 to
 tax
 rates


than
 the


poor
 right
 because
 they're
 they're


wealthy
 it
 makes
 up
 you
 know
 they
 still


have
 so
 much
 left
 over
 they
 can
 still


live
 their
 lives
 and
 yet
 they
 seem
 to
 be


far
 more
 sensitive
 to
 even
 subtle


changes
 and
 tax
 rates
 now
 that
 maybe


because
 they're
 more
 focused
 on
 whatever


there's
 all
 kinds
 of
 other
 reasons
 you


can
 come
 up
 with
 but
 fundamentally
 as
 a


psychological
 problem
 you
 would
 think


the
 acquisition
 of
 great
 wealth
 would


permanently
 remove
 any
 worries
 I
 had


about
 in
 impingements
 on
 my
 wealth
 right


because
 you're
 rich
 now
 but
 people
 never


they
 never
 seem
 to
 Rich
 people
 never


seem
 to
 reach
 the
 point
 where
 they
 say


I'm
 rich
 and
 that
 means
 I
 can
 now
 focus


on
 enjoying
 myself
 hanging
 out
 with
 my


family
 going
 sailing
 you
 know
 no
 they're


still
 obsessed
 with
 the
 impingements
 on


their
 own
 wealth
 so
 that's
 sort
 of


mystery
 number
 one
 mystery
 number
 two
 is


that
 you
 would
 think
 that
 the


acquisition
 of
 great
 wealth
 would
 make


you
 aware
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 rest
 of


the
 world
 looks
 at
 you
 differently
 in


other
 words
 if
 I
 am
 a
 s


year-old
 uh
 working
 two
 jobs
 with
 no


money
 um
 and
 I
 complain
 the
 world


understands
 the
 nature
 of
 my
 complaints


you're
 young
 you
 have
 no
 money
 your


family
 um
 but
 if
 you
 that
 17-year-old


grows
 up
 to
 be
 a
 billionaire
 the
 world


looks
 on
 that
 same
 set
 of
 complaints


very
 differently
 instead
 of
 being


sympathetic
 and
 understanding
 of
 them


the
 world
 now
 says
 why
 are
 you


complaining
 right
 so
 there's
 a
 certain


point
 in
 the
 maturation
 of
 an
 individual


where
 we
 have
 to
 realize
 we
 can
 no


longer
 behave
 in
 the
 same
 way
 as
 we
 did


previously
 if
 we
 would
 like
 to
 maintain


the
 respect
 of
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world


around
 us
 many
 many
 wealthy
 people
 don't


make
 that
 transition
 they
 don't


understand
 that
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 hear


about
 their
 complaining
 anymore
 once


they
 have
 enormous
 wealth
 why
 don't
 they


get
 it
 well
 that's
 a
 really
 interesting


question
 um
 part
 of
 it
 there's
 a
 benign


explanation
 which
 is
 that
 we
 and
 I'm


sure
 you've
 observed
 this
 too
 in
 talking


to
 people
 who
 are
 powerful
 that
 we


permanently
 inhabit
 the
 world
 of
 our


youth
 right
 in
 other
 words
 if
 somebody


was
 grew
 up
 in
 very
 humble
 beginnings


and
 attains
 enormous
 wealth
 some
 part
 of


them
 is
 always
 someone
 to
 grw
 up
 in


humble
 beginnings
 in
 other
 words
 they


can't
 transcend
 the
 kind
 of
 um
 the
 the


psychological
 framework
 they
 established


as
 a
 young
 person
 that's
 one
 um
 uh


definition
 the
 second
 definition
 is
 the


more
 Insidious
 one
 is
 that
 um
 the


condition
 of


um
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 the
 function
 that


being
 embedded
 in
 a
 network
 is
 uh
 is
 it


is
 a
 a
 form
 of
 Correction
 other
 words
 I


my
 friends
 around
 me
 govern
 my
 um
 my


utterances
 my
 behavior
 by
 they
 they're


the
 ones
 who
 make
 me
 aware
 of
 when
 I've


stepped
 over
 a
 line
 or
 um
 uh
 as


those
 um
 influence
 when
 you
 get
 higher


and
 higher
 and
 higher
 on
 the
 higher
 up


the
 scale
 the
 number
 of
 people
 in
 that


correcting
 Circle
 starts
 to
 shrink
 you


no
 longer
 get
 the
 you're
 not
 getting


feedback
 anymore
 on
 your
 behavior
 right


you
 complain
 because
 all
 your
 friends


complain
 and
 nobody's
 telling
 you
 not
 to


exactly
 yeah
 my
 think
 about
 my


three-year-old
 gets
 nonstop
 feedback
 on


her
 behavior
 I
 mean
 every
 single
 thing


she
 does
 if
 she
 grows
 up
 to
 be
 a


billionaire
 that
 will
 vanish
 and
 that's


a
 very
 different
 condition
 in
 which
 to


live
 your
 life


related
 to
 this
 uh
 many
 successful


people
 stay
 at
 work
 much
 longer
 than


they
 need
 to
 and
 uh
 I
 meet
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 continue
 to
 work
 really


really
 hard
 long
 into
 the
 70s
 and
 even


80s
 why
 is
 it
 so
 important
 for
 them
 to


continue
 going
 well
 because
 it's


fun
 right
 I
 mean
 it
 I
 I
 suspect
 I
 will


be
 one
 of
 those
 people


and
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 from
 from
 a
 kind
 of


could
 I
 for
 example
 retire
 at
 this


moment
 I
 could
 my
 brother
 has
 retired


he's
 he
 retired
 at
 my
 age
 his
 friend


best
 friend
 retired
 I
 mean
 lots
 of


people
 in
 my
 age
 retire
 I'm
 not
 retired


I
 have
 no
 intention
 of
 so
 doing
 why
 not


um
 there's
 no


reason
 for
 me
 to
 do
 what
 I
 do
 continue


to
 do
 what
 I
 do
 other
 than
 I
 find
 it


enjoyable
 and
 I
 always
 have
 and
 it's


just
 a
 way
 of
 feeling
 connected
 to
 the


world
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 very
 actually
 I


don't
 find
 that
 pattern
 of
 behavior


problematic
 I
 find
 it
 kind
 of
 lovely
 do


you
 think
 it
 is
 because
 they
 have
 their


identity
 tied
 up
 to
 their
 position
 yeah


but
 I
 think
 that's
 fine
 I
 I
 I
 think
 you


know
 it
 it
 can
 be
 there
 are
 versions
 of


this
 that
 are
 highly
 problematic
 uh
 Joe


Biden
 staying
 in
 office
 long
 past
 the


point
 where
 he
 should
 have
 that
 had


really
 profound
 consequences
 for
 his


party
 um
 and
 for
 the
 country
 um
 that's


the
 worst
 case
 scenario
 a
 lack
 of


self-awareness
 about
 or
 the
 CEO
 who
 who


is
 no
 longer
 capable
 of
 doing
 their
 job


who's
 hanging
 on
 um
 but
 there
 are
 other


versions
 of
 people
 who
 are
 who
 remain


very
 involved
 with
 what
 they're
 doing


that
 I
 think
 are
 lovely
 and
 wonderful


and
 in
 a
 world
 where
 you
 know
 we
 are
 we


are
 transitioning
 to
 a
 world
 where
 I'm


guessing
 uh
 longevity
 is
 going
 to


undergo
 some
 pretty
 dramatic


improvements
 so
 we
 better
 get
 used
 to


this
 my


daughters
 are
 you
 know
 are
 probably


going
 to
 live
 to
 what
 I
 don't
 know
 120
 I


mean
 uh
 Nicola
 you
 and
 I
 might
 we
 might


actually
 our
 expectation
 of
 when
 we
 die


May
 in
 the
 next
 10
 years
 so
 dramatically


change
 that
 we
 might
 still
 be
 living


very
 productive
 lives
 at
 100
 or
 whatever


in
 which
 case
 you
 know
 are
 you
 am
 I


really
 going
 to
 spend
 the


last
 uh
 35
 years
 of
 my
 life
 Idol
 no
 I


mean
 it's
 it
 seems
 inconceivable
 so
 why


wouldn't
 I
 want
 to
 continue
 doing
 the


thing
 I'm
 that
 makes
 me
 happy
 well
 um


one
 of
 the
 things
 you
 do
 uh
 is
 also
 uh


to
 Zig
 when
 other
 people
 are
 zagging
 you


are
 contrarian
 in
 your
 thinking
 and
 um


why
 why
 is
 it
 so
 difficult
 to
 be


contrarian
 well
 for
 many
 people
 there


are
 there
 are


real
 Stakes
 involved
 in
 being
 contrarian


um
 you
 know
 the
 the
 contrarian


investor
 I
 remember
 once
 years
 ago


interviewing
 uh
 I
 spent
 I
 did
 a
 whole


piece
 on
 Nim
 TB
 um
 and
 before
 before
 he


was
 sort
 of
 famous
 and
 he
 was
 describing


you
 know
 he
 had
 a
 he
 had
 a


longtail
 uh
 fund
 and
 the
 nature
 of
 a


longtail
 fund
 is
 that
 every
 day
 you
 lose


a
 little
 bit
 of
 money
 in
 the
 hopes
 that


that
 one
 day
 that
 a
 day
 that
 you
 have
 no


idea
 you
 cannot
 predict
 when
 you'll
 make


it
 all
 back
 in
 a
 rush
 so
 this
 is
 the


person
 who
 who
 wrote
 The
 Black
 Swan
 yeah


the
 person
 who
 wrot
 the
 black
 Black
 Swan


and
 you
 know
 he
 was
 at
 that
 is
 a


contrarian
 investing
 position
 there
 are


very
 few
 people
 at
 that
 time


particularly
 who
 took
 that
 kind
 of


position
 and
 it's
 really
 really
 hard


because
 you
 will
 face
 nothing
 but
 social


pressure
 um
 for


95%
 of
 the
 time
 of
 the
 duration
 of
 your


fund
 right
 everyone
 around
 you
 every


friend
 you
 have
 everyone
 you
 went
 to


business
 school
 with
 everyone
 you
 went


to
 you
 know
 worked
 at
 you
 know
 wherever


bare
 Sterns
 with
 is
 making
 money
 every


day
 and
 you're
 losing
 money
 every
 day


there's
 consequences
 the
 contrarian


doctor
 who
 decides
 that
 a
 certain
 kind


of
 of
 treatment
 is
 more
 advantageous


than
 another


um
 will
 face
 the
 disapproval
 of
 their


peers
 and
 patients
 until
 such
 time
 as


they
 can
 prove
 it
 and
 that
 can
 be
 years


I
 mean
 I've
 told
 stories
 of
 the
 I
 I


remember
 writing
 a
 story
 about
 the
 guy


who
 essentially
 invents
 combination


chemotherapy
 who
 was
 ostracized
 by
 his


peers
 at
 the
 National
 Cancer
 Institute


for
 10
 years
 for
 10
 years
 he
 couldn't


even
 get
 graduate
 students
 to
 work
 in


his
 lab
 right
 10
 years
 and
 then
 at
 the


end
 of
 it
 he
 was
 like
 oh
 by
 the
 way
 I


fundamentally
 changed
 the
 way
 we
 treat


and
 he
 he
 got
 his
 payoff
 then
 but
 he
 had


to
 have
 a
 level
 of
 my
 point
 is
 if
 you're


a
 journalist
 there
 is
 no
 social
 cost
 to


being
 contrarian
 none
 it
 doesn't
 like
 if


anything
 there
 in
 a
 benefit
 you
 stand


out
 from
 the
 crowd
 like
 it's
 a
 weird
 so


i'
 what's
 the
 most
 contrarian
 thing
 you


think
 about
 these
 days
 these
 days
 yeah


that's
 interesting
 the
 problem
 is


there's
 many
 definitions
 to
 contrarian


there
 are
 positions
 I
 have
 that
 are


contrarian
 within
 my
 Social
 Circle
 but


are
 not
 contrarian
 in
 the
 World
 At
 Large


so
 you
 know
 if
 you
 in
 my
 Social
 Circle


it's
 quite
 contrarian
 to
 believe
 in


markets
 I
 have
 to
 believe
 in
 markets


that
 I
 I
 I
 share
 your
 view
 on
 that
 one


yeah
 um
 when
 you
 um
 how
 do
 you
 come
 up


with
 aders
 for
 your
 books
 um
 you
 the


search
 for
 a
 new
 idea
 comes
 after


activity
 not
 before
 in
 other
 words
 I


don't
 come
 up
 with
 an
 idea
 and
 then
 go


out
 in
 the
 world
 and
 pursue
 it
 what
 you


do
 is
 you
 immerse
 yourself
 in
 the
 world


in
 the
 hes


of
 coming
 up
 with
 an
 idea
 in
 other
 words


you
 write
 so
 ideas
 emerg
 very
 often
 out


of
 the
 previous
 thing
 you
 were
 working


on
 you
 because
 you
 chose
 to
 write
 about


this
 unusual
 area
 with
 an
 uncertain


outcome
 what
 you
 did
 along
 the
 way
 was


to
 serendipitously
 come
 up
 with
 a
 bunch


of
 other
 ideas
 that
 the
 reason
 people


have
 difficulty
 with
 ideas
 is
 that


they're
 static
 finding
 IDE
 is
 is
 there


static
 you
 can't
 be
 static
 you
 must
 be


moving
 and
 sometimes
 so
 movement
 is


intellectual
 movement
 is
 good
 for
 its


own
 sake
 um
 and
 that
 is
 a
 kind
 of
 that's


a
 difficult
 thing
 to
 grasp
 when
 you're


starting
 out
 an
 easy
 thing
 to
 grasp
 when


I
 think
 you're
 older
 what
 does
 a
 day


look
 like
 for
 you
 um
 it
 depends
 what


stage
 I
 am
 in
 the
 process
 but
 I
 um
 like


many
 writers
 I
 think
 writing
 is
 in
 the


morning
 there's
 a
 few
 hours
 in
 the


morning
 that
 are
 quite
 essential
 for


where
 I'm
 highly
 productive
 um
 there's


uh


a
 certain
 amount
 of
 kind
 of
 random


reading
 of
 things
 of
 people
 who
 I
 find


interesting
 and
 and
 then
 but
 the
 real


heart
 of
 it
 is
 there
 are
 certain
 periods


over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 Year
 where
 I
 I


have
 very
 concentrated
 bursts
 of
 lots


and
 lots
 and
 lots
 of
 interviews
 of


people
 um
 and
 that's
 the
 core
 that's


when
 you
 and
 I
 will
 you
 know
 typically


what
 happens
 when
 I'm
 doing
 something
 is


I
 will
 have
 a
 very
 narrow
 sense
 of
 what


I
 want
 and
 then
 in
 the
 course
 of
 doing


multiple
 interviews
 that
 will
 inevitably


broaden
 do
 you
 do
 them
 in
 person
 well
 uh


as
 when
 I
 can
 um
 a
 lot
 on
 Zoom
 now
 these


days
 because
 um
 it's
 it
 turns
 out
 to
 be


very
 efficient
 I
 wish
 when
 I
 was
 if
 I


didn't
 have
 a
 family
 I
 would
 travel
 a


lot
 more
 to
 do
 my
 interviews
 but
 I
 just


it
 there's
 just
 a
 they
 real
 kind
 of
 um


external
 limitations
 now
 on
 how
 much
 I


can
 travel
 now
 you
 are
 uh
 you
 know
 a


world
 Superstar
 so
 you
 probably
 can


interview
 whoever
 you
 like
 but
 who
 who


is
 on
 who
 is
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 list
 for


the
 moment
 I'm
 well
 I'm
 interested
 I'm


doing
 a
 big
 project
 on
 um


uh
 on
 uh
 the
 death
 penalty
 at
 the
 moment


that's
 one
 of
 the
 big
 things
 I'm
 doing


and
 I'm
 there
 a
 particular
 case
 I'm


interested
 in
 um
 I
 you
 know
 I
 have
 I


don't
 have
 a
 kind
 of
 hierarchical
 wish


list
 in
 other
 words
 if
 you
 told
 me


tomorrow
 that
 I
 could
 interview
 you
 know


have
 an
 hour
 and
 a
 half
 with
 Donald


Trump
 I
 would
 I'm
 not
 interested
 in


talking
 to
 Donald
 Trump
 or
 any
 or
 if
 you


told
 me
 I
 could
 I
 could
 talk
 to
 any


Fortune
 500
 CEO
 I
 wanted
 to
 for
 an
 hour


and
 a
 half
 tomorrow
 I
 would
 say
 actually


not
 that's
 I'm
 fine
 I
 don't
 need
 that


but
 what
 I
 would
 like
 is
 you
 know
 it's


funny
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 this
 thing
 with


Eli
 Lily
 in
 Las
 Vegas
 and
 I'm


interviewing
 a
 guy
 he
 not
 the
 CEO
 he's
 I


don't
 know
 how
 many
 steps
 down
 it's
 a


very
 big
 company
 let's
 just
 say
 he's


five
 steps
 down
 I
 love
 talking
 to
 the


guys
 who
 are
 five
 steps
 down
 um
 I'm


laughing
 because
 I'm
 actually


interviewing
 the
 CEO
 soon
 oh
 I
 see
 no


but
 nothing
 against
 the
 CEO
 and
 Sher
 is


super
 interesting
 but
 there
 are
 real


limitations
 in
 about
 what
 he
 can
 say
 and


there
 real
 limitations
 about
 what
 he


knows
 and
 from
 a
 journalist
 standpoint


he
 what
 he
 would
 have
 what
 the
 CEO
 would


have
 is
 a
 broad
 conceptual
 understanding


of
 where
 the
 company
 is
 headed
 very


useful
 if
 you're
 an
 investor
 but
 I'm
 a


Storyteller
 what
 I
 want
 are
 specifics


details
 like
 Oddities
 anomalies
 like
 and


the
 person
 who's
 five
 steps
 down
 is
 the


one
 who
 knows
 that
 who
 can
 say
 the
 thing


that
 the
 CEO
 will
 almost
 never
 tell
 you


is


um
 I
 had
 this
 funny
 moment
 when
 I
 ran


into
 this
 person
 and
 they
 said
 the


following
 thing
 and
 I
 went
 back
 and
 I


talked
 they
 don't
 that's
 not
 what
 their


life
 is
 Right
 whereas
 the
 guy
 who
 pipes


sits
 down
 he's
 actually
 on
 the
 phone


with
 the
 customer
 or
 he's
 on
 the
 phone


with
 the
 guy
 in
 the
 lamp
 and
 the
 guy
 in


the
 lab
 says
 you
 know
 oh
 my
 God
 you


wouldn't
 believe
 what
 happened
 yesterday


like
 this
 that's
 the
 story
 I
 want
 you


know
 we
 had
 this
 assay
 and
 I
 thought
 it


wasn't
 going
 to
 work
 and
 it
 turns
 out
 or


whatever
 you
 know
 so
 that's
 that's
 why
 I


want


and
 I
 don't
 know
 who
 that
 the
 guy
 five


steps
 down
 the
 guy
 I
 want
 I
 don't
 know


who
 he
 is
 right
 I
 can
 identify
 the
 CEO


but
 I
 need
 to
 do
 some
 digging
 and
 in


order
 to
 find
 I
 had
 an
 interview
 last


year
 we
 were
 doing
 all
 this
 stuff
 with


IBM
 and
 it
 was
 during
 Co
 actually
 and


there
 was
 a
 guy
 who
 who
 was
 part
 of


their
 Logistics
 practice
 and
 it
 was
 it


was
 just
 like
 so
 interest
 it
 was
 stuff
 I


had
 no
 idea
 about
 he
 had
 like
 really


specific
 granular
 insight
 and
 this
 whole


point
 of
 course
 you
 would
 notice
 I


didn't
 notice
 that
 bottlenecks
 in
 uh
 in


in
 during
 covid
 were
 a
 behavioral


problem
 they
 weren't
 actually
 it
 was
 a


particular
 human
 Dynamic
 about
 people


cascading
 you
 know
 decisions
 and
 and
 he


used
 a
 very
 specific
 thing
 and
 walked
 me


through
 it
 and
 it
 was
 like
 that's
 what
 I


want
 I
 mean
 he
 was
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 it


you
 know
 and
 he
 Comm
 and
 he
 was
 excited


about
 genuinely
 excited
 about
 the


details
 of
 that
 particular


um
 problem
 do
 you
 think
 C
 are
 boring


well
 I
 think
 they
 should
 be
 why
 should


they
 be
 boring
 well
 they
 shouldn't
 be


what
 I
 say
 to
 go
 back
 to
 something
 you


said
 earlier
 that
 trust
 emerges
 out
 of


consistency
 and
 you
 were
 talking
 in
 that


sense
 I
 suspect
 largely
 about


consistency
 in
 performance
 but
 I
 think


it's
 also
 true
 of
 consistency
 in
 um
 uh


in
 in
 self-presentation
 we
 want
 someone


who
 uh
 you
 don't
 want
 the
 CEO
 who
 when
 I


when
 you
 say
 someone
 is
 interesting
 what


you
 mean
 is
 there
 is
 a
 variation
 in


their
 self-presentation
 right
 like
 if


you
 think
 about
 I
 am
 not
 consistent
 in


self-presentation
 there's
 sometimes
 when


I
 get
 really
 really
 wound
 up
 and
 there's


sometimes
 when
 I
 you
 know
 that's
 not
 I'm


not
 what
 you
 want
 in
 a
 c
 in
 a
 CEO
 you


don't
 you
 don't
 want
 someone
 like
 you


know
 and
 then
 you
 want
 someone
 who's


right
 that's
 the
 job
 the
 job
 is
 really


hard
 and
 needs
 a
 of
 focused
 steady


attention
 and
 that's
 enormously


reassuring
 to
 the
 investor
 but
 you
 the


manic
 you
 don't
 want
 manic
 behavior
 in


someone
 who's
 running
 a
 large
 scale


Enterprise
 you
 may
 want
 that
 in
 the


person
 five
 steps
 down
 but
 not
 in
 the


not
 in
 the
 person
 running
 the
 show
 I


haven't
 really
 thought
 about
 um
 boring


and
 consistency
 as
 a
 management
 quality


but
 I
 see
 I
 totally
 see
 what
 you
 mean


very
 interesting
 what
 are
 you
 currently


reading
 I
 am
 reading
 what
 am
 I
 reading


I'm
 reading
 a
 bunch
 of
 books
 on
 um
 on


forgiveness
 um
 because
 it's
 so
 Central


to
 this
 thing
 I'm
 doing
 on
 the
 death


penally
 um
 and
 I'm
 very
 interested
 in
 um


what
 the
 kind
 of
 uh
 how
 you
 you
 know
 the


how
 the
 uh
 what
 the
 kind
 of


practical
 uh
 implications
 of
 forgiveness


are
 in
 other
 words
 it's
 one
 thing
 to


talk
 about
 that
 is
 I
 forgive
 you
 and


then
 the
 second
 harder
 question
 is
 all


right
 so
 what
 does
 that
 actually
 mean
 in


terms
 of
 how
 I
 would
 respond
 to
 some


transgression
 by
 you
 um
 and
 how
 would


that
 play
 out
 in
 a


formal
 uh
 process
 of
 law
 which
 is
 a
 very


you
 know
 in
 a
 uh
 in
 a
 in
 a
 Vengeance


based
 Criminal
 Justice
 System
 such
 as
 we


have
 in
 the
 United
 States
 that's
 a
 very


very
 very
 crucial
 question
 what
 made
 you


start
 to
 work
 on
 this
 topic
 uh
 random
 uh


I
 this
 one
 is
 actually
 I
 had
 a
 friend


who
 um
 said
 to
 me
 I
 have
 this
 friend


named
 Kate
 who's
 really
 interesting
 you


should
 talk
 to
 her
 and
 I
 said
 what
 does


she
 do
 he
 said
 she's
 a
 psychologist
 and


I
 said
 all


right
 and
 I
 started
 talking
 to
 her
 and


then
 it
 just
 LED
 turns
 out
 she
 is
 really


interesting
 and
 led
 me
 in
 a
 million


different
 directions
 do
 you
 read
 a
 lot


of
 books
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I
 read
 a
 lot


of
 uh
 fiction
 at
 the
 same
 I
 tend
 to
 read


a
 lot
 of
 um
 detective
 fiction
 and
 um
 spy


novels
 and
 things
 um
 and
 I
 realize
 I've


been
 doing
 it
 my
 entire
 life
 and
 I


realize
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 I
 think
 there's
 so


much
 to
 be
 learned
 learned
 I
 mean
 I


enjoy
 them
 but
 then
 secondarily
 I
 think


unconsciously
 I
 am
 drawn
 I'm
 looking
 for


lessons
 about
 how
 to


tell
 uh
 complicated
 stories
 which
 is


what
 a
 and
 how
 to
 order
 a
 the
 definition


of
 a
 of
 a
 good
 spine
 novel
 or
 a
 good


mystery
 is
 it
 is
 an
 exercise
 in


disordered
 information
 flow
 right
 that


if
 I'm
 talking
 to
 you


about
 uh
 an
 event
 that
 happened


yesterday
 the
 fall
 of
 Syria


I
 say
 Syria
 fell
 yesterday
 Assad's
 in


Moscow
 and
 then
 we
 proceed
 to
 talk
 about


why
 right
 if
 I
 was
 writing
 a
 thriller


about
 it
 I'd
 flip
 it
 I
 would
 withhold


the
 fact
 that
 Syria
 fell
 yesterday
 in


assads
 in
 Moscow
 and
 we
 would
 start
 at


the
 beginning
 and
 at
 the
 end
 and
 I
 the


big
 surprise
 would
 be
 the
 whole
 thing


falls
 apart
 and
 Assad's
 in
 Moscow
 right


that's
 disordered
 information
 that's
 a


much
 more
 the
 efficient
 way
 to
 talk


about
 Siri
 is
 the
 first
 way
 the
 fun
 way


is
 the
 second
 way
 right
 so
 I'm
 in
 the


fun
 business
 I'm
 in
 the
 disordered


information
 now
 disordered
 information


stories
 are
 really
 really
 they're
 much


harder
 to
 tell
 every
 child
 knows
 how
 to


tell
 an
 orderly
 story
 but
 a
 good


disordered
 story
 is
 like
 there
 are
 only


at
 any
 given
 time
 in
 the
 world
 of


literature
 what
 50
 people
 who
 can
 tell
 a


good
 one
 I
 mean
 it's
 an
 astonishing


small
 I'm
 talking
 about
 in
 in
 the


developer
 an
 astonishing
 small
 number
 of


people
 right
 why
 is
 John
 mcer


revered
 50
 years
 after
 he
 wrote
 some
 of


his
 best
 work
 because
 he
 could
 do
 the


disordered
 story
 what
 are
 the
 other
 keys


to


that
 to
 telling
 a
 good
 story
 well
 it's


about


pacing
 so
 I
 can't
 withhold
 information


forever
 otherwise
 you
 leave
 you
 become


frustrated
 you
 you
 don't
 understand
 what


the
 point
 is
 so
 I
 have
 to
 impress
 upon


you
 that
 the
 Enterprise
 in
 which
 we're


embarked
 has
 a
 payoff
 even
 though
 I


can't
 tell
 what
 it
 is
 that
 you
 need
 to


be
 patient
 and
 I
 need
 to
 kind
 of
 service


your
 impatience
 throughout
 the
 story
 by


giving
 you
 little
 bits
 that
 create
 the


confidence
 in
 you
 that
 there
 will
 be
 a


dramatic
 resolution
 right
 I
 need
 I
 need


to
 know
 that
 the
 reader
 needs
 to
 know


the
 listener
 needs
 to
 know
 that
 the
 the


Storyteller
 can
 pull
 it
 off
 you
 know
 uh


you
 know
 um
 uh
 what's
 her
 name
 who
 wrote


Harry
 Potter
 uh
 Rin
 that
 was
 her
 IUS
 was


that
 she
 could
 in
 a
 600
 page
 book
 she


could
 Telegraph
 to
 a


9-year-old
 that
 there
 was
 enough
 going


on
 here
 that
 it
 was
 worth
 uh
 it
 was


worth
 investing
 in
 this
 a
 process
 that


would
 could
 take
 weeks
 did
 do
 you
 read


the
 Harry
 Potter
 books
 my
 kids
 are
 too


my
 kids
 are
 too
 young
 but
 they
 will
 when


the
 time
 comes
 we
 will
 do
 we
 will
 do
 an


awful
 lot
 of
 Harry
 Potter
 do
 you
 uh


finish
 books
 do
 you
 always
 finish
 them


no
 uh
 if
 I
 to
 this
 very
 point
 point
 when


I
 lose
 confidence
 in
 the
 storyteller's


ability
 to
 land
 the
 plane
 I
 I
 I
 just


abandon
 the
 book
 and
 how
 quickly
 can


that
 be
 how
 how
 how
 fast
 can
 that
 be
 I


have
 abandoned
 books
 with
 five
 pages


left
 right
 and
 what's
 the
 quickest
 you


abandon
 a


book
 probably
 the
 first
 page
 if
 I
 just


think
 you're
 not
 setting
 it
 up
 for
 me
 in


a
 way
 that's
 compelling
 or
 you're
 trying


to
 tell
 me
 too
 much
 the
 the
 tip
 off
 is


when
 they
 try
 and
 tell
 you
 too
 much
 on


the
 first
 page
 which
 is
 by
 the
 way
 you


there
 are
 important
 lessons
 you
 know


some
 our
 our
 mutual
 friend
 malag
 ganar


loves
 to
 talk
 about
 storytelling
 and


investing
 that
 and
 I
 she's
 absolutely


right
 um
 that
 that's
 what
 we're
 looking


for
 yeah
 is
 can
 is
 this
 we're
 about
 to


entrust
 our
 money
 to
 an
 entity
 and
 we


need
 to
 know
 that
 they
 have
 a
 story


about
 what
 they're
 doing
 and
 the
 story


needs
 to
 be
 compelling
 and
 it
 needs
 to


in
 many
 ways
 resemble
 the
 story
 that
 I'm


talking
 about
 and
 we
 have
 to
 have
 the


confidence
 that
 the
 the
 that
 we're


embarking
 on
 this
 journey
 that
 it
 will


end
 well
 right
 that's
 a
 storytelling


function
 you
 don't
 know
 you
 know
 Apple


in
 1980
 whatever
 you
 don't
 know
 they're


going
 to
 land
 the
 plane
 but
 somehow


Steve
 Jobs
 manages
 to
 communicate
 the


confidence
 that
 he
 can
 that's
 he's
 a


Storyteller
 a
 really
 good
 one
 right
 yeah


how
 do
 you


relax
 uh
 well
 I'm
 a
 a
 running
 would
 be


one
 and
 uh
 uh
 reading
 my
 spy
 tillers
 and


hanging
 out
 with
 my
 with
 my
 children


would
 be
 the
 the
 leading
 ones
 and
 what


is
 your
 advice
 to
 young
 people
 who
 want


to
 think
 differently
 travel
 would
 be
 the


first
 uh
 in
 fact
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 think


I
 it
 it
 may
 not
 it
 may
 not
 even
 be


necessary
 at
 the
 beginning
 to
 go
 further


than
 that
 I
 I
 just
 think
 particularly


now
 um
 when
 you
 have
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 fun


one
 of
 the
 one
 of
 the
 dysfunctions
 of


elite
 production
 in
 the
 west
 is
 that
 we


increasingly


sequester
 uh
 young
 people
 in
 these
 um


homogeneous
 universes
 right
 they're


simply
 not
 getting
 access
 to
 people


outside
 their
 class
 peer
 group
 and


that's
 fine
 it's
 a
 very
 efficient
 way
 of


learning
 the
 you
 know
 the
 the
 modes
 of


kind
 of
 Elite
 Performance
 but
 it
 really


hampers
 them
 when
 they
 are
 put
 in
 a


position
 where
 they
 have
 to
 deal
 with


someone
 outside
 outside
 of
 their
 world


and
 what
 is
 the
 fastest
 way
 outside
 of


that
 bubble
 is
 to
 travel
 I
 don't
 think
 a


a
 university
 education
 for
 example
 is


complete
 if
 it
 does
 not
 require
 the


student
 to
 not
 just
 leave
 the
 school
 but


leave
 the
 school
 and
 go
 somewhere
 that


is
 uh
 profoundly
 different
 in
 its
 social


structure
 and
 and
 political
 structure


and
 whatever
 structure
 than
 the
 than


their
 place
 they
 grow
 up
 well
 Malcolm

 have
 taken
 us
 on
 uh
 travel
 after


travel
 with
 your
 with
 your
 books

 are


just
 an
 incredible
 Storyteller

have
 pulled
 it
 off
 Time
 After
 Time
 After


Time

 are
 looking
 forward
 to

pulling
 it
 off

 other
 things
