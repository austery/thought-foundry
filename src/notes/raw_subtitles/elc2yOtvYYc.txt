Welcome
 everyone
 to
 the
 OnPy
 podcast.


I'm
 Steve
 Pacen


>> and
 I'm
 John
 Michael
 McGrath.


>> Today
 on
 the
 pod,
 well,
 we
 want
 to
 talk


about
 those
 $75
 million
 ads
 featuring


former
 President
 Ronald
 Reagan.
 They


certainly
 had
 impact
 as
 the
 current


President
 Donald
 Trump
 has
 a
 hissyfitit


about
 them.


>> The
 government
 floated
 a
 controversial


trial
 balloon
 affecting
 renters
 and
 then


that
 balloon
 promptly
 blew
 up
 in
 their


faces.
 We'll
 explain
 why
 they
 retreated.


Premier
 Doug
 Ford
 has
 introduced
 some


big
 changes
 to
 the
 way
 we
 do
 elections


in
 Ontario.
 And
 everything
 old
 is
 new


again.


>> And
 in
 your
 column,
 my
 column,
 I
 will


beg
 Ontario's
 reformers
 to
 stop
 being


afraid
 of
 amending
 the
 Constitution.


>> And
 I'm
 going
 to
 tell
 you
 about
 a
 former


member
 of
 the
 Ontario
 legislature
 who


may
 be
 the
 most
 renaissance
 man
 you've


never
 heard
 of.
 Stick
 around
 for
 that.


>> It's
 Friday,
 October
 31st,
 2025.
 Happy


Halloween,
 everybody,
 and
 let's
 get
 to


it.


Little
 sugar.
 JMM.
 No
 sir.
 We
 are
 not


exactly
 uh
 in
 costume
 today.
 No.


Although
 we
 do
 have
 kind
 of
 our
 World


Series
 uniforms
 on.


>> Yes.
 Exactly.


>> There
 we
 go.
 We're
 both
 sporting
 the


Blue
 Jays
 today.
 Yes.


>> You've
 got
 you've
 got
 the
 logo
 in
 the


top
 left
 corner
 right
 over
 your
 heart


where
 it
 belongs.


>> A
 bigger
 logo
 on
 the
 back,
 but
 I
 can't


quite
 turn
 the
 camera
 in
 our
 chairs.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 This
 uh
 is
 a
 32-year-old


shirt.


>> Yes.


>> That
 I
 am
 wearing.
 I'm
 going
 to
 stand
 up


a
 little
 bit
 here
 so
 you
 can
 see
 it.
 The


last
 time
 the
 Blue
 Jays
 won
 the
 World


Series,
 I
 got
 this
 t-shirt.
 I
 think
 it


actually
 belonged
 to
 my
 mother,
 so
 I'm


wearing
 my
 mom's
 t-shirt.
 But,
 uh,
 as


you
 will
 no
 doubt
 remember,


>> I
 do.


>> Uh,
 Joe
 Carter
 hit
 the
 home
 run
 to
 win


the
 Blue
 Jays
 the
 World
 Series
 32
 years


ago
 in
 game
 six.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 Friday
 night,
 it's
 game
 six
 back
 at


the
 dome
 and
 they've
 got
 a
 chance
 to


repeat
 make
 history
 again.


>> Yes.
 And
 and
 I
 mean,
 we
 were
 just


talking
 a
 bit
 off
 mic
 about
 this,
 but


you
 know,
 obviously
 I
 want
 the
 Jays
 to


win,
 but
 it
 has
 been
 uh
 such
 a
 a


gratifying
 series
 and
 and
 with
 with
 some


lower
 points
 earlier
 in
 the
 season.
 It's


been
 a
 good
 year.
 So,
 I'm
 I'm
 uh
 very


excited.
 Do


>> you
 know what's
 great
 about
 this
 team?


They
 are
 so
 lovable.
 There's
 so
 many


wonderful
 stories.
 There's
 so
 many


unprecedented
 things
 they
 have
 done.
 You


know,
 Treya
 Savage
 with
 his
 incredible


pitching.
 Um,
 uh,
 Addison
 Barger
 with


that
 pinch
 hit
 grand
 slam
 home
 run.


Never
 happened
 before
 in
 World
 Series


history.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 there's
 a
 lot


to
 love
 about
 this
 team.
 Win


>> David
 Schneider
 has
 been
 one
 of
 these


guys
 all
 year,
 right?


>> David
 Schneider.
 Does
 that
 count
 for
 a


Bill
 Davis
 reference
 calling
 him
 David


Schneider?


>> I
 want
 to
 actually
 talk
 about
 because


I'm
 not
 wearing
 a
 premier
 today.
 And
 um,


but
 30
 years
 ago
 today
 as
 we
 sit
 here


taping
 this
 was
 one
 of the
 most


consequential
 days
 in
 Canadian
 history.


Um,
 were
 you
 born
 yet?
 Yes,
 I
 was
 uh
 14.


>> You
 were
 14.
 Okay.
 Um


this
 was
 referendum
 day,
 October
 30th,


1995.
 Mike
 Harris
 had
 only
 just
 become


premier
 of
 Ontario
 a
 few
 months
 earlier


and
 suddenly
 found
 dumped
 in
 his
 lap


this
 uh
 referendum
 uh
 on
 the
 future
 of


Canada,
 Quebec
 voting
 again.
 When
 I
 was


a
 kid
 in
 1980,
 it
 was
 the
 referendum


between
 Pier
 Trudeau
 and
 Renie
 Lec.
 And


it
 wasn't
 close.
 It
 was
 604.
 We're


staying
 in
 Canada.
 But
 this
 time
 it
 was


50.5%
 to
 49
 a.5%
 and
 it
 was
 well
 I
 know


a
 lot
 of
 people
 sort
 of
 thought
 we
 were


going
 to
 lose
 the
 country
 that
 night.
 It


it
 felt
 like
 a
 near-death
 experience.


>> It
 did.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 In
 some
 ways
 Mike


Harris
 speaking
 of
 which
 took
 his
 kids


to
 Montreal.
 Can't
 remember
 if
 it
 was


the
 day
 or
 two
 days
 before
 the
 actual


voting
 day.
 And
 he
 he
 basic
 you
 know
 one


of
 those
 kids
 is
 a
 cabinet
 minister
 in


Doug
 Ford's
 government
 now.
 Mike
 Jr.
 and


he
 basically
 just
 went
 there.
 No
 special


attention,
 no
 security.
 He
 went
 there


just
 as
 a
 dad
 taking
 his
 kids
 to
 to
 kind


of
 contribute
 to
 the
 demonstration
 of


affection
 that
 so
 many
 English
 Canadians


were
 giving
 Quebecers.
 I
 think
 a
 100,000


people
 gathered
 in
 downtown
 Montreal


that
 day
 for
 the
 uh
 for
 that


demonstration.


The
 forces
 of
 separation
 have
 been
 kind


of
 in
 obeyance
 ever
 since
 then
 30
 years


ago.
 Um
 but
 you
 know
 the
 parti
 kebeekqua


is
 looking
 pretty
 good
 right
 now
 in


terms
 of
 winning
 the
 next
 election
 in


Quebec
 and
 they
 have
 promised
 to
 hold


another
 referendum.
 So
 this
 issue
 never


really
 ever
 totally
 goes
 away
 does
 it?


>> No
 no
 I
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 it's
 been
 part


of
 our
 history
 you
 know
 literally
 you


can
 read
 headlines
 on
 the
 the
 broad


sheets
 from
 1867
 right
 like
 immediately


after
 the
 British
 North
 America
 Act
 is


promulgated
 and
 comes
 into
 force
 there's


you
 know
 subheads
 about
 like
 Quebec


separatists
 mull
 their
 next
 move.
 Um,


you
 know,


I'm
 actually
 going
 to
 talk
 a
 bit
 more


about
 this
 in
 your
 column,
 my
 column.
 U


but
 one
 of
 the
 you
 you
 asked
 if
 I
 was


alive
 in
 1995.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 if
 you're


old
 enough
 to
 remember
 that
 era,
 right,


we
 went
 through
 Meech
 Lake,
 Charlotte


Town,
 and
 then
 the
 second
 uh
 Quebec


referendum.
 And
 if
 if
 you
 want
 a
 a


signpost
 for
 my
 adolescence,
 right,
 uh
 I


remember
 the
 referendum
 on
 Charlotte


Town,
 but
 did
 not
 really
 understand
 it


at
 the
 time.
 Uh
 by
 the
 time
 we
 get
 to


the
 Quebec
 referendum,
 the
 second
 Quebec


referendum,
 uh
 I
 was
 14
 and
 I
 both
 uh


remember
 it
 and
 understood
 the
 stakes.


So
 just
 to
 give
 you
 an
 idea
 of
 like,
 you


know,
 yes,
 I
 was
 one
 of
 those
 cool


14-year-olds
 who
 was,
 you
 know,
 staying


up
 watching
 the
 returns
 come
 in
 that


night.
 Um
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 I
 think
 that
 era


has
 so
 um
 scarred
 people
 uh
 with
 you


know
 the
 the
 memories
 of
 of
 these


attempts
 at
 constitutional
 revision
 uh


in
 ways
 that
 still
 um
 affect
 our


political
 justice.


>> We've
 been
 terrified
 to
 revisit
 this


issue
 and
 I
 state
 for
 the
 record
 that


that
 Quebec's
 signature
 is
 still
 not
 on


the
 constitution.
 They
 are
 of
 course


bound
 by
 it
 but
 they
 have
 not
 yet
 signed


it.
 They
 didn't
 when
 Pierre
 Trudeau


repatriated
 the
 Constitution
 with
 a


charter
 back
 in
 1982.
 It
 did
 not
 happen


again
 after
 the
 referendum
 of
 1995.
 And


here
 we
 are
 30
 years
 later.
 Still
 no


signature.


>> The
 the
 one
 federalist
 caveat
 that


somebody
 is
 going
 to
 be
 angry
 if
 I
 don't


uh
 point
 this
 out
 is
 that
 the
 majority


of
 Quebec
 MPs
 did
 in
 fact
 vote
 for
 the


passage
 of
 of
 the
 Constitution.


>> 73
 out
 of
 75
 something
 like
 that.


>> They
 were
 all
 liberals
 under
 Trudeau.


But
 yes,
 an
 ominous
 day
 in
 history.


Anyway,
 we're
 still
 a
 country.


>> Yeah,
 we're
 still
 a
 country.
 Not
 yet
 a


51st
 state.
 Still
 a
 country.
 Still
 with


Quebec.
 It's
 a
 beautiful
 thing.


>> Okay.
 And
 with
 that,
 off
 to
 wish
 you


one.


>> Is
 there
 anyone
 out
 there
 that
 hasn't


seen
 the
 province
 of
 Ontario's


anti-tariff
 ads
 starring
 Ronald
 Reagan?


Well,
 we
 know
 one
 thing.
 Donald
 Trump


saw
 them
 and
 he
 didn't
 like
 them
 at
 all.


In
 fact,
 he
 had
 a
 little
 hissy
 fit
 and


put
 an
 additional
 10%
 tariff
 on
 Canada


while
 at
 the
 same
 time
 acknowledging


that
 if
 he
 were
 Doug
 Ford,
 he'd
 be
 doing


the
 same
 thing.
 JMM,
 let's
 talk
 about


the
 fallout
 from
 this
 whole
 ad
 campaign,


>> right?
 Well,
 so
 first
 of
 all,
 let's
 talk


a
 bit
 about
 the
 the
 effectiveness
 of
 the


ad.
 Uh
 the
 government
 says
 that
 they
 uh


garnered
 11
 billion
 impressions,
 which


is,
 you
 know,
 how
 we
 rate
 the


effectiveness
 of
 ads.
 Uh,
 Premier
 Ford


says
 this
 marks
 it
 as
 the
 most


successful
 political
 ad
 campaign
 ever.


Uh,
 those
 uh,
 retaliatory
 tariffs,


however,
 that
 the
 president
 has


announced,
 uh,
 they
 are
 announced,
 they


have
 not
 yet
 been
 implemented
 and
 there


is
 no
 stated
 timeline
 for
 implementing


them.
 Uh,


it's
 just
 a
 thing
 that
 the
 president
 has


said
 right
 now.


>> Are
 are
 you
 saying
 he
 he
 says
 something


and
 and
 he
 may
 not
 mean
 it
 and
 he
 may


not
 actually
 do
 it?


>> You
 know,
 sometimes
 words
 just
 happen,


man.
 Wow.
 Wow.
 What
 a
 concept.


>> Um
 the
 the
 president
 had
 said
 that
 he


was
 not
 going
 to
 speak
 with
 uh
 Prime


Minister
 Mark
 Carney
 again
 for
 some
 time


after
 uh
 the
 the
 provincial
 government's


ad
 campaign
 went
 live
 and
 then


apparently
 they
 actually
 had
 a
 a
 brief


meeting
 and
 and
 spoke
 in
 South
 Korea


this
 week.
 Um
 again,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


want
 to
 scandalize
 anybody,
 but


sometimes
 we
 can't
 quite
 take
 President


Trump
 at
 his
 word.


>> Really,
 I
 want
 to
 write
 that
 down.
 I


just
 uh
 that's
 a
 new
 thing.
 Well,
 I


mean,
 here
 we
 go
 again.
 Apparently,
 the


American
 ambassador
 to
 Canada,
 Pete


Hora,
 tore
 a
 strip
 off
 Ontario's
 man
 in


Washington,
 who's
 David
 Patterson.
 And


when
 the
 premier
 found
 out
 about
 it,
 he


was
 not
 happy.
 And
 he
 demanded
 that


Ambassador
 Hora
 apologize
 to
 Patterson.


And
 then
 he
 went
 further
 than
 that.


Let's
 take
 a
 look.


>> Come
 on,
 Ambassador.
 He's
 a
 guy.
 Do
 you


know
 something?
 I
 like
 him.
 Uh
 Pete,
 you


got
 to
 call
 uh
 Dave
 up
 and
 apologize.


It's
 simple.
 you
 you
 know
 the
 cheese


slipped
 off
 the
 cracker.
 I
 get
 it.


You're
 ticked
 off,
 but
 call
 the
 guy
 up.


Um
 because
 you're
 a
 good
 guy
 and
 and


Dave's
 my
 champion.
 The
 guy
 is
 just


instrumental
 in
 these
 trade
 deals
 down


in
 Washington.


>> Yeah,
 David
 Patterson
 used
 to
 work
 for


General
 Motors.
 He
 knows
 the
 auto


industry
 obviously
 like
 the
 back
 of
 his


hand.
 He
 knows
 inter
 um
 interprovincial.


He
 knows
 international
 trade
 extremely


well.
 That's
 what
 he's
 doing
 in


Washington,
 trying
 to
 represent
 our


interest
 down
 there.
 Premier
 Ford,
 you


know,
 he
 has
 faced
 some
 criticism
 for


this
 ad
 campaign
 that
 it
 was
 needlessly


provocative
 and,
 you
 know,
 putting
 a
 red


flag
 in
 front
 of the
 bull,
 that
 type
 of


thing.
 Um,


accused,
 I
 guess,
 of
 blowing
 up
 the


latest
 round
 of
 negotiations.
 What
 did


the
 premier
 have
 to
 say
 about
 that?


Let's
 find
 out.
 Doug
 Ford,
 what
 do
 they


expect
 me
 to
 do?
 Sit
 back
 and
 roll
 over


like
 every
 other
 person
 in
 the
 world?


The
 intention
 wasn't
 to
 go
 poke
 the


president
 in
 the
 eye.
 My
 intention
 was


to
 get
 a
 conversation
 going,
 wake
 up
 the


Democrats
 a
 little
 bit
 down
 there.
 And


my
 goodness,
 it
 woke
 him
 up.
 All
 right.


And
 they're
 still
 talking
 about
 it
 on


CNN.
 We
 love
 Americans.
 Uh
 I'll
 tell


you,
 we
 don't
 we
 don't
 love
 uh
 President


Trump.
 I'll
 tell
 you
 that.
 I
 think
 he


was
 at
 in
 the
 poll
 I
 saw
 on
 CNN
 is
 minus


60.
 I
 don't
 know.
 Minus
 60.
 I
 don't
 know


how
 much
 lower
 you
 can
 get
 than
 -
 60.
 So


why
 don't
 why
 doesn't
 the
 president


start
 being
 nice?
 uh
 play
 nice
 in
 the


sandbox
 to
 his
 biggest
 customer
 in
 the


entire
 world
 and
 uh
 everything's
 hunky


dory.


>> Everything's
 hunky.
 The
 minus
 60
 I
 think


refers
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 when
 you
 ask


people,
 you
 know,
 do
 you
 approve
 of
 do


you
 disapprove
 of
 60
 points
 more
 people


disapprove
 of
 Donald
 Trump.
 I'm


surprised
 it's
 only
 60,
 frankly,
 but


there
 you
 go.
 Well,
 it
 it
 you
 know,
 for


those
 of
 us
 who
 um
 don't
 mind
 that
 uh


people
 net
 disapprove
 of
 the
 president


uh
 right
 now,
 uh
 it
 is
 I
 think
 now
 uh


his
 lowest
 approval
 rating
 uh
 ever
 and


certainly
 lower
 than
 he
 was
 in
 at
 this


point
 in
 his
 first
 term.
 Uh
 and
 it's


kind
 of
 shocking
 to
 remember
 that
 we
 are


not
 yet
 a
 full
 year
 into
 Donald
 Trump's


second
 term.
 Um
 yeah
 uh
 this
 whole


incident
 just
 uh
 I
 I
 don't
 know how
 else


to
 put
 this
 except
 to
 say
 that
 I
 I


really
 feel
 like
 we
 as
 a
 country
 are
 not


dealing
 with
 serious
 people
 in


Washington
 right
 now.


>> Well,
 they're
 unpredictable.
 Let's
 put


it
 that
 way.


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 like
 how
 is
 this
 a


reasonable
 reaction
 to
 a
 commercial,


right?
 Like
 this
 was
 not
 a
 commercial


that
 said
 like
 anything


actually
 insulting
 or
 demeaning
 about


Donald
 Trump.
 It
 just
 reminded
 Americans


uh
 broadly
 and
 Republicans
 specifically


that
 Ronald
 Reagan
 and
 like
 there
 are


definitely
 critiques
 one
 can
 make
 about


Ronald
 Reagan's
 record
 on
 free
 trade
 but


on
 the
 whole
 he
 was
 a
 believer
 in
 free


trade
 and
 specifically
 a
 believer
 in


free
 trade
 with
 Canada
 like
 negotiated


the
 free
 trade
 agreement
 for
 God's
 sake


right
 you
 know
 Doug
 Ford
 has
 faced


accusations
 about
 he
 you
 know
 he
 blew


things
 up
 or
 uh
 you
 know
 some
 people
 are


saying
 oh
 well
 like
 Mark
 Carney
 is
 not


doing
 a
 good
 good
 enough
 job
 negotiating


with
 Donald
 Trump
 and
 and
 I
 just
 I
 I


wrote
 about
 this
 for
 the
 website
 as


well,
 but
 I
 will
 just
 reiterate
 that
 the


person
 responsible
 for
 Donald
 Trump's


actions
 is
 Donald
 Trump.
 Indeed.
 You


know,
 I'm
 going
 to
 drop
 a
 little
 story


on
 you
 here
 because
 if
 we
 go
 back
 to


those
 middle
 1980s
 when
 Brian
 Maloney


was
 the
 prime
 minister
 of
 Canada
 and


Ronald
 Reagan
 was
 president
 of
 the


United
 States,
 there
 was
 a
 terrible


irritant
 between
 our
 two
 countries
 and


it
 was
 called
 acid
 rain.
 American


pollution
 because
 of
 the
 prevailing


winds
 was
 was
 going
 up
 the
 stacks
 of


industry
 in
 the
 states,
 particularly


close
 to
 the
 border,
 and
 it
 was
 pushing


all
 that
 pollution
 into
 Canada.
 And


then,
 of
 course,
 when
 it
 mingled
 with


the
 clouds
 and
 rain
 came
 down,
 it
 was


killing
 our
 lakes
 and
 streams.
 And
 we


needed
 to
 do
 something
 about
 acid
 rain


or
 our
 our
 environment
 was
 going
 to
 be


killed.
 And
 needless
 to
 say,
 the
 tourism


that
 went
 along
 with
 that
 was
 going
 to


be
 a
 problem.
 And
 Ronald
 Reagan
 gathered


his
 advisers
 around
 and
 said, "What
 do


you
 think
 we
 should
 do
 about
 this?"
 And


the
 advisers
 said,
 'Well,
 there's
 no


votes
 in
 doing
 anything
 about
 this.


Don't
 do
 anything.
 And
 Ronald
 Reagan


looked
 at
 his
 adviserss
 and
 said,


"Actually,
 no.
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 something


on
 this
 because
 Brian
 needs
 it."
 And
 the


relationship
 between
 the
 president
 and


the
 prime
 minister
 was
 so
 good
 that
 the


fact
 that
 Brian
 Mun
 needed
 a
 political


win
 was
 enough
 for
 Ronald
 Reagan
 to


actually
 end
 up
 spending
 billions
 of


dollars
 encouraging
 a
 cleaning
 up
 of
 the


environment
 near
 the
 border,
 which


helped
 Canada.
 It's
 impossible
 to


imagine
 that
 happening
 today
 because


there's
 just
 a
 different
 cat
 in
 the


White
 House
 today
 who
 kind
 of
 has


jettisoned
 Republican
 policy
 for
 the


last
 80
 years.
 And
 um
 here
 we
 are.
 I
 I


will
 add,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 almost
 don't


even
 want
 to
 raise
 this
 because
 like


responding
 to
 arguments
 on
 social
 media


is
 a
 waste
 of
 everybody's
 time.
 But


there
 is
 a
 criticism
 of
 the
 ad
 that
 it


was
 deceptively
 edited
 that
 in
 fact
 in


the
 speech
 that
 we've
 been
 talking
 about


for
 however
 many
 weeks
 now
 uh
 that


Ronald
 Reagan
 in
 fact
 endorses
 tariffs.


There's
 a
 very
 specific
 historical
 event


that
 Reagan
 is
 referring
 to
 uh
 where


there
 was
 a
 dispute.
 I
 mean
 there
 were


lots
 of
 trade
 disputes
 between
 the
 US


and
 Japan
 uh
 during
 the
 1980s
 and
 in


that
 particular
 instance
 uh
 Reagan
 had


uh
 just
 imposed
 uh
 tariffs
 on


semiconductors
 uh
 against
 uh
 Japan
 and


even
 in
 the
 context
 of
 that
 speech
 uh


Ronald
 Reagan
 is
 saying
 that
 he
 was


loathed
 to
 do
 it
 that
 it
 was
 an


exception
 to
 his
 generally
 uh
 held


belief
 uh
 in
 uh
 low
 tariffs
 or
 no


tariffs
 in
 free
 trade
 and
 uh
 certainly


Nothing
 in
 that
 speech
 right
 in
 its


whole
 context
 uh
 endorses
 anything
 like


the
 policies
 of
 the
 current
 American


government.


>> Quite
 true.
 And
 with
 that,
 we're
 on
 to


issue
 two.


Doug
 Ford
 has
 always
 had
 a
 smoother


relationship
 with
 homeowners
 and


developers
 than
 with
 tenants.
 So
 perhaps


it
 was
 no
 surprise
 that
 the
 premier


announced
 his
 government
 intended
 to


implement
 a
 policy
 that
 developers
 would


like
 and
 tenants
 really
 would
 not.
 JMM,


what
 was
 the
 follow
 from
 all
 of
 that?


>> So,
 this
 was
 a
 proposal
 that
 was


revealed
 during
 a
 technical
 briefing
 as


part
 of
 a
 larger
 package
 of
 housing


reforms
 that
 the
 government
 um
 had


announced,
 including
 a
 new
 bill
 that
 was


introduced
 by
 uh
 Municipal
 Affairs


Minister
 Rob
 Flack
 uh
 last
 week.
 Uh


aside
 from
 the
 legislative
 changes
 that


they
 introduced,
 which
 we'll
 get
 back
 to


in
 a
 bit,
 uh
 the
 government
 also
 wanted


to
 start
 a
 round
 of
 consultations
 about


changing
 the
 rules
 regarding
 fixedterm


leases.
 So,
 currently
 in
 Ontario,
 if
 you


sign
 a
 monthly
 lease
 on
 an
 apartment,


let's
 say
 it's
 it's
 for
 a
 one-year
 term,


uh,
 when
 that
 lease
 is
 up,
 that
 is
 not


on
 its
 own
 grounds
 for
 an
 eviction,
 uh,


or
 or
 for
 a
 renegotiation
 of
 any
 of
 the


terms,
 right?
 The
 the
 terms
 of
 the


existing
 lease
 continue.


And
 uh
 so
 long
 as
 you
 are
 otherwise
 a


tenant
 in
 good
 standing,
 you
 you
 know,


you
 continue
 to
 uh
 pay
 your
 rent
 on
 time


and
 you're
 not
 disruptive
 or
 whatever,


you
 continue
 to
 enjoy
 all
 of
 the
 uh


protections
 of
 uh
 Ontario
 rental
 law
 for


what
 that
 is
 worth.
 Um
 the
 government


was
 proposing
 to
 um
 start
 consultations


that
 could
 have
 given
 landlords
 more


power
 to
 evict
 tenants
 when
 the
 term
 of


a
 fixedterm
 lease
 expires.


>> Now,
 why
 would
 the
 province
 want
 to
 do


that?
 So
 the
 government's
 position
 is


that,
 you
 know,
 Ontario's
 existing


rental
 laws
 make
 it
 harder
 than
 it


should
 be
 to
 be
 a
 landlord
 and
 that
 by


making
 the
 rules
 more
 favorable,
 more


cenial
 for
 landlords,
 they
 can
 bring


more
 investment
 into
 the
 rental
 space


and
 into
 uh
 rental
 homes
 and
 ease
 that


crunch.
 So,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 one
 of


those
 cases
 where,
 you
 know,
 taken
 uh
 uh


at
 face
 value,
 the
 argument
 is
 that
 it


might
 not
 be
 directly
 good
 for
 existing


renters,
 but
 it
 would
 be
 good
 for
 the


rental
 market
 and
 that
 would
 have
 the


effect
 of
 being
 good
 for
 renters


overall.


>> And
 the
 reaction
 was
 when
 this
 idea
 was


unveiled,
 you're
 laughing
 already.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 predictable
 and
 understandable


outrage
 on
 the
 parts
 of
 uh
 tenant


advocates.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 before
 I
 get


into
 this,
 I
 want
 to
 stress
 that
 like


all
 we
 ever
 got
 from
 the
 government
 was


a
 a a
 idea
 that
 they
 were
 going
 to
 start


consultations.
 So,
 it's
 not
 really


possible
 for
 us
 to
 comment
 on
 any
 kind


of
 detailed
 policy
 because
 that
 never


emerged.
 Um,
 but
 it
 is
 hard
 to
 imagine
 a


change
 to
 the
 status
 quo
 that
 would
 have


been
 a
 net
 positive
 for
 current
 renters


uh
 along
 the
 lines
 of
 what
 the


government
 was
 even
 sort
 of
 sketching


out
 in
 this
 uh
 technical
 briefing.


Right.
 The
 whole
 uh
 the
 whole
 point
 of


considering
 this
 kind
 of
 a
 change
 is
 to


give
 landlords
 more
 control
 over
 their


property.
 That
 was
 how
 it
 was
 phrased
 in


the
 technical
 briefing.
 If
 you're
 going


to
 give
 landlords
 more
 control,
 you
 are


going
 to
 be
 taking
 control
 away
 from
 uh


tenants.
 And
 so
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of


criticism,
 a
 lot
 of
 fear
 that
 this
 would


uh
 functionally
 even
 further
 weaken


Ontario's
 rent
 control
 laws.
 um
 could


have
 put
 tenants
 uh
 at
 the
 mercy
 of


landlords
 who
 uh
 would,
 you
 know,
 really


just
 have
 a
 a
 very
 a
 much
 freer
 hand
 to


evict
 them
 or
 uh
 jack
 up
 their
 rents.
 Um


after
 several
 days
 of
 fierce
 criticism,


the
 government
 uh
 announced
 via
 a


Twitter
 post
 uh
 that
 they
 would
 not
 be


proceeding
 with
 any
 changes
 to
 the


fixedterm
 leases.
 So,
 turns
 out
 that


trial
 balloon
 was
 made
 of
 lead.


>> I
 guess
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 politics
 of


this
 though,
 there's
 two
 ways
 of
 looking


at
 it.
 One
 is
 that
 they
 didn't
 think


through
 the
 potential
 ramifications
 of


this
 policy
 change
 and
 therefore
 they


kind
 of
 got
 egg
 all
 over
 their
 faces
 or


as
 you
 put
 it,
 they
 put
 up
 a
 trial


balloon.
 They
 wanted
 to
 see
 whether
 or


not
 it
 would
 fly.
 Uh
 it
 clearly
 didn't


and
 they
 changed
 their
 minds
 and
 kudos


to
 them
 for
 changing
 their
 minds.
 How
 do


you
 see
 it?
 You
 know,
 one
 of
 the


political
 details
 here
 that
 is
 um


intriguing
 is
 who
 specifically
 would


have
 been
 uh
 most
 vulnerable
 to
 harm
 if


uh
 these
 kinds
 of
 changes
 had
 gone


through.
 Right?
 Again,
 stressing
 that
 we


don't
 know
 any
 kind
 of
 details
 because


it
 never
 got
 that
 far.


If
 you
 want
 to
 sketch
 out
 the
 kind
 of


person
 who
 would
 be
 uh
 most
 at
 the
 mercy


of
 their
 landlords
 uh
 if
 they
 had
 made


changes
 to
 these
 uh
 fixedterm
 leases,


they
 would
 be
 the
 kind
 of
 tenant
 who
 uh


had
 held
 their
 current
 home
 for
 a
 long


time.
 Uh
 probably
 has
 had
 some


protection
 from
 Ontario's
 rent
 control


laws.
 So
 they
 are
 uh
 currently
 paying
 a


much
 lower
 rent
 than
 that
 unit
 would


command
 on
 the
 open
 market
 today,
 right?


uh
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 person
 who
 a


landlord
 has
 the
 most
 incentive
 to
 try


and
 evict
 and
 turn
 over
 that
 unit.
 Um
 I


think
 it's
 fair
 to
 say
 this
 this


hypothetical
 person
 I'm
 sketching
 out
 to


you
 is
 also
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 an
 older


person
 and


politics
 is
 complicated
 but
 I
 think
 it's


still
 broadly
 true
 that
 older
 people
 are


more
 likely
 to
 vote
 progressive


conservative
 than
 uh
 other
 demographics


>> even
 tenants


>> uh
 even
 with
 tenants
 although
 as
 I
 say


it
 gets
 complicated
 the
 more
 you
 slice


and
 dice
 these
 these
 demographics.
 So,


you
 know,
 I
 can't
 prove
 to
 you
 that


anybody
 pointed
 this
 out
 to
 the


premier's
 office
 or
 members
 of
 cabinet.


Uh,
 but
 the
 uh
 the
 the
 climb
 down
 uh


offers
 that
 intriguing
 possibility.


>> Okay.
 So,
 what's
 the
 status
 of
 the
 bill?


This
 is
 bill
 60
 we're
 talking
 about.


Where's
 that
 at
 now?


>> Right.
 So,
 this
 is
 the
 bill
 that
 uh


Minister
 Flack
 introduced
 and
 uh
 it's


called
 the
 Fighting
 Delays
 Building


Faster
 Act.
 Um,
 and
 so
 as
 I
 think
 we're


going
 to
 see
 a
 bunch
 of
 uh
 in
 the
 fall


because
 the
 government
 has
 not
 given


themselves
 a
 ton
 of
 legislative
 time.


This
 is
 a
 big
 omnibus
 bill
 that
 does
 a


bunch
 of
 different
 things.
 And
 I
 want
 to


mention
 it
 specifically
 because
 even


though
 the
 government
 has
 climbed
 down


on
 uh
 what
 was
 potentially
 the
 most
 um
 I


don't know
 inflammatory
 changes
 uh
 to


rental
 rules.
 Uh
 they
 are
 making
 a
 bunch


of
 other
 changes
 to
 Ontario's
 rental


laws
 in
 this
 bill
 um
 that
 are
 very


likely
 to
 become
 law
 unless
 of
 course
 uh


the
 bill
 is
 amended
 at
 committee.
 Uh
 the


government
 is
 attempting
 to
 streamline


the
 processes
 at
 the
 landlord
 and
 tenant


board
 which
 handles
 disputes
 between
 as


you
 might
 imagine
 landlords
 and
 tenants.


Um
 and
 uh
 there's
 a
 bunch
 of
 rule


changes
 that
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 go
 into


the
 details
 of
 but
 broadly
 speaking
 u
 I


think
 it's
 fair
 to
 say
 that
 they
 would


give
 renters
 fewer
 procedural
 rights


than
 uh
 they
 currently
 enjoy
 when
 they


are
 challenging
 uh
 their
 evictions
 or


challenging
 behavior
 by
 uh
 landlords.
 uh


so
 uh
 they
 would
 not
 have
 all
 the
 same


alternatives
 they
 have
 for
 uh
 uh


delaying
 the
 process
 or
 introducing
 new


uh
 uh
 new
 issues
 in
 their
 hearing
 that


kind
 of
 thing.
 So
 while
 renters
 um


dodged
 a
 bullet
 in
 the
 last
 week
 there


are
 still
 uh
 other
 bullets.
 That's
 a
 bad


there
 are
 more.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 there
 are
 more
 changes
 coming
 that


renters
 might
 not
 necessarily
 love.


>> I
 feel
 an
 obligation
 to
 check
 a
 box


here.
 Are
 you
 ready?


>> Let's
 do
 who
 brought
 in
 rent
 review
 50


years
 ago
 and
 uh
 one
 month
 50
 years
 and


one
 month
 ago.


>> Uh
 I
 mean
 we
 already
 did
 our
 Bill
 Davis


check
 but
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 Bill
 Davis.


>> I
 believe
 you
 are
 correct.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 In


an
 attempt
 to
 save
 uh
 what
 was
 a
 um


terrible
 election
 campaign
 for
 the


progressive
 conservative
 party
 and
 the


one-term
 premier
 at
 that
 point,
 Bill


Davis.
 Uh
 there
 were
 stories
 in
 the


newspapers
 every
 day
 about
 seniors


getting
 evicted
 from
 their
 apartments


because
 they
 couldn't
 afford
 never
 mind


double
 but
 tripledigit
 rent
 increases.


And
 as
 a
 result
 he
 brought
 in
 rent


review
 during
 the
 course
 of
 the
 campaign


and
 that
 saved
 his
 campaign
 and
 Mr.


Davis
 hung
 on
 with
 the
 minority


government
 in
 75
 another
 minority
 in
 77


and
 then
 got
 the
 majority
 back
 in
 81
 50


years
 ago
 this
 year
 that
 rent
 review


came
 in.
 I'll
 just
 add
 that,
 you
 know,


historically
 that
 was
 when
 governments


brought
 in
 uh
 rent
 control
 rules,
 you


know,
 World
 War
 I,
 World
 War
 II,
 and


then
 in
 the
 70s
 with
 periods
 of
 high


inflation,
 governments
 brought
 in
 uh


rent
 control
 rules.
 And
 then
 at
 some


point
 in
 the
 70s,
 we
 sort
 of
 just


decided
 to
 leave
 the
 rent
 control
 in


place.
 And
 there
 are
 all
 sorts
 of


nuances
 to
 that,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 those


housing
 policies
 have
 been
 held
 over
 uh


since
 the
 1970s.
 And
 so
 when
 people
 if


people
 ever
 doubt
 why
 for
 example
 uh


Bill
 Davis
 is
 important
 and
 relevant
 in


today's
 politics
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff


that
 we
 did
 uh
 in
 housing
 politics
 still


affects
 us
 today.


>> In
 fact
 I
 think
 there
 was
 a
 guy
 who


wrote
 a
 600page
 book
 about
 Bill
 Davis


and
 the
 premise
 of
 the
 book
 was
 we're


still
 living
 in
 Bill
 Davis's
 Ontario.


>> Never
 heard
 of
 it.


>> No,
 me
 neither.
 And
 with
 that
 we're
 off


to
 issue
 three.


For
 most
 of
 Ontario's
 history,
 premers


called
 elections
 pretty
 much
 whenever


they
 wanted
 to
 during
 their
 5-year
 term.


Obviously,
 with
 a
 view
 to
 picking
 a
 date


that
 they
 thought
 best
 for
 their


re-election
 prospects.
 But
 two
 decades


ago,
 Premier
 Daltton
 McGinty
 tried
 to


level
 the
 playing
 field
 by
 passing
 a


fixed
 election
 date
 law.
 The
 idea
 was


everyone
 would
 know
 the
 date
 of
 the
 next


election,
 making
 it
 fairer
 for
 all
 the


parties.
 Well,
 of
 course,
 earlier
 this


year,
 Premier
 Doug
 Ford
 disregarded
 the


spirit
 of
 that
 law
 by
 calling
 an


election
 on
 his
 own
 timing
 only
 two
 and


a
 half
 years
 into
 his
 mandate.
 And
 so,


he's
 decided,
 let's
 get
 rid
 of
 this
 law


altogether.
 JMM,
 what's
 the
 story?


>> Right.
 So,
 uh,
 this
 was
 announced
 via
 a


press
 release.
 Um,
 and
 I
 want
 to
 clarify


that
 we
 haven't
 actually
 seen
 the
 law


yet.
 It's
 coming
 next
 week
 with
 the
 fall


economic
 statement
 we
 are
 told.
 But
 the


government
 of
 Ontario
 is
 proposing
 a


number
 of
 updates
 to
 the
 election
 act


including
 uh
 as
 you
 have
 alluded
 to


removing
 uh
 fixed
 election
 dates.
 Uh
 in


a
 press
 release
 the
 attorney
 general


Doug
 Downey
 is
 quoted
 as
 saying
 this


will
 move
 Ontario
 away
 from


Americanstyle
 elections.
 Uh
 I
 suspect


they
 are
 uh
 hoping
 to
 ride
 some
 of
 the


current
 um
 animosity
 that
 Canadians
 have


for
 our
 neighbors
 to
 the
 south
 of
 the


border.


never
 never
 that
 bad
 a
 bet
 in
 Canadian


politics
 to
 to
 rail
 against
 something
 as


American
 style.
 Um
 but
 you
 know
 at
 this


point
 in
 2025
 and
 at least
 for
 a
 little


bit
 longer
 right
 most
 provinces
 and


territories
 and
 the
 federal
 government


at least
 nominally
 uh
 has
 uh
 or
 have


fixed
 election
 date
 laws
 on
 the
 books.


So
 it
 is
 not
 uh
 purely
 an
 American
 thing


and
 as
 we
 say
 you
 know
 Ontario's
 law
 is


more
 than
 20
 years
 old.


It
 would
 be
 easy
 to
 poke
 the
 attorney


general
 for
 his
 trying
 to
 make
 this
 a


kind
 of
 an
 American
 thing.
 But
 the


reality
 is
 the
 notion
 of
 fixed
 election


dates
 is
 not
 part
 of
 our
 tradition.
 It


was
 an
 American
 imported
 idea
 if
 you


like
 because
 of
 course
 they
 do
 have


fixed
 election
 dates
 down
 there
 that


they
 do
 not
 divert
 from
 at
 all.


>> And
 and
 the
 fact
 of
 the
 matter
 is
 that
 I


understood
 what
 Mr.
 McGinty
 was
 trying


to
 do
 20
 years
 ago
 with
 a
 fixed
 election


date
 in
 in
 as
 much
 as
 you
 know
 it
 really


was
 in
 some
 respects
 democratizing
 to


take
 that
 power
 away
 from
 the
 premier


and
 basically
 say
 we're
 going
 to
 have


you
 know
 even
 Steven
 fair
 and
 square


everybody
 knows
 when
 the
 election's


coming.
 Um
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 there
 was
 a


kind
 of
 an
 out
 clause
 in
 the
 fixed


election
 date
 law
 which
 basically
 said


you
 know


>> the
 election
 will
 take
 place
 on
 such
 and


such
 a
 date
 four
 years
 from
 now
 unless


in
 the
 wisdom
 of
 the
 first
 minister
 of


the
 day
 he
 thinks
 we
 need
 to
 go
 earlier


or
 she
 thinks
 we
 need
 to
 go
 earlier.
 So


when
 Doug
 Ford
 called
 this
 a
 fake
 law


which
 the
 word
 fake
 is
 never
 advisable


to
 use
 in
 in
 the
 era
 of
 Trump.


>> Yeah.


>> Having
 said
 that
 he's
 not
 totally
 wrong


about
 that
 is
 he?


>> No.
 And
 it
 it
 it
 was
 an
 American
 import


into
 the
 sort
 of
 Canadian
 and
 and
 you


know
 uh
 before
 that
 the
 you
 know
 British


parliamentary
 tradition
 and
 it
 never
 sat


really
 well
 with
 the
 rest
 of
 our


institutions,
 right?
 Um
 I'
 I've
 been
 a


skeptic
 of
 these
 fixed
 election
 state


laws
 for
 a
 long
 time
 in
 the
 same
 way


that
 I'm
 skeptical
 of
 we've
 talked


before
 about
 like
 balanced
 budget
 laws


or
 you
 know
 this
 government
 um
 uh
 trying


to
 pass
 laws
 prohibiting
 road
 tolls,


right?
 None
 of
 these
 laws
 can
 tie
 the


hand
 of
 a
 future
 government


fundamentally.
 Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 Doug


Ford
 is
 not
 alone
 in
 uh
 breaking
 fixed


election
 term
 laws,
 right?
 Justin


Trudeau
 did
 so
 in
 2021.
 Uh,
 now
 neither


man
 profited
 terribly
 from
 uh
 the
 the


political
 decision
 to
 do
 that,
 right?


They
 both
 got
 returned
 uh
 to
 their


respective
 assemblies
 with
 roughly
 the


same
 number
 of
 seats
 as
 they
 had
 going


into
 them.
 So,
 u
 you
 know,
 voters
 don't


seem
 to
 have
 rewarded
 that
 behavior.
 Uh


but
 you
 know,
 again,
 ultimately
 these


laws
 just
 can't
 do
 what
 the
 the


marketing
 uh
 claims,
 which
 isn't
 to
 say


that
 these
 laws
 don't
 have
 their


defenders,
 of
 course.
 Uh
 back
 in
 2015,
 a


lawyer
 named
 Tom
 Engel
 tried
 to
 get
 an


injunction
 to
 stop
 Jim
 Apprentice,
 who


was
 then
 the
 premier
 of
 Alberta,
 from


calling
 an
 early
 election.
 Uh
 at
 the


time,
 Angel
 said
 calling
 a
 snap
 election


was
 illegal
 and
 a
 waste
 of
 taxpayer


money.
 Uh
 it
 was
 u
 an
 interesting
 test


of
 Alberta's
 law
 but
 it
 didn't
 uh
 work


out
 uh
 for
 Engle
 uh
 or
 for
 that
 matter


for
 Apprentice
 who
 did
 call
 the
 early


election
 and
 then
 promptly
 uh
 lost
 it.


Uh
 and
 we
 saw
 the
 first
 NDP
 government


in
 Alberta
 uh
 with
 Rachel
 Notley


becoming
 the
 premier.


>> Right.
 Uh
 there
 is
 one
 other
 change
 that


the
 government
 is
 going
 to
 propose
 as


well
 which
 is
 that
 once
 this
 bill


becomes
 law
 campaign
 contributions
 are


going
 to
 get
 almost
 50%
 bigger
 under


what's
 currently
 permitted.
 I
 think
 up


to
 $5,000
 in
 contributions
 and
 I
 guess


we
 should
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the


implications
 of
 that.
 What
 do
 you
 see?


>> Right.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 the
 common


intuition
 is
 that
 this
 will
 be
 good
 for


the
 government.
 Uh
 we
 don't
 have


corporate
 or
 union
 donations
 to
 Ontario


elections.
 So
 uh
 functionally
 all


donations
 are
 individual
 ones
 and
 the


individual
 cap
 on
 donations
 ends
 up


being
 the
 real
 limit
 on
 how
 much
 parties


can
 raise.
 The
 Tories
 raise
 the
 most


money
 as
 governing
 parties
 usually
 do.


Uh
 but
 uh
 current
 liberal
 lead
 I
 guess


he's
 not
 the
 liberal
 leader.
 Bonnie


Crombie
 is
 still
 the
 liberal
 leader
 but


uh
 John
 Fraser
 uh
 the
 parliamentary


leader
 parliamentary
 leader
 um
 has
 been


pointing
 out
 to
 reporters
 this
 week
 with


a
 bit
 of
 a
 a
 smile
 uh
 that
 he
 says
 you


know


>> the
 Tories
 may
 raise
 the
 most
 money
 but


they're
 also
 spending
 the
 most
 money.


And
 he
 says
 that
 like
 you
 know
 they're


if
 you
 look
 at
 their
 numbers
 the
 the


burn
 rate
 for
 the
 progressive


conservative
 party
 is
 is
 extremely
 high.


So
 his
 theory
 uh
 is
 that
 this
 is
 this


change
 is
 largely
 about
 the
 Tories


finding
 new
 ways
 to
 raise
 money
 for
 uh


to
 feed
 their
 party's
 spending
 habits.


Um
 but
 speaking
 of
 money
 uh
 there
 is
 one


other
 change
 that
 uh
 is
 going
 to


continue
 benefiting
 the
 government
 uh


most
 of
 all
 uh
 that
 is
 the
 announcement


that
 uh
 after
 I
 think
 we
 could
 call
 it


several
 years
 of
 uh
 will
 they
 won't
 they


uh
 the
 tries
 are
 keeping
 the
 pervote


subsidy
 uh
 they
 had
 originally
 pledged
 I


think
 back
 in
 2018
 to
 scrap
 it
 and
 then


when
 co
 hit
 they
 decided
 that
 oh
 no


we'll
 keep
 the
 the
 the
 pervote
 subsidy


around
 a
 little
 bit
 longer
 and
 they
 kept


extending
 it
 and
 so
 now
 they've
 Yes,


we're
 keeping
 the
 per
 vote
 subsidy.
 This


al
 this
 directly
 benefits
 the
 government


most
 of
 all
 the
 tries
 and
 it's
 fair,


right?
 Like
 the
 tries
 got
 the
 most
 votes


in
 the
 last
 election.
 The
 subsidy
 is,


you
 know,
 a
 certain
 dollar
 figure
 per


vote
 you
 get.


>> I
 think
 it's
 a
 couple
 of
 bucks.
 You
 get


something
 like
 two
 and
 a
 quarter
 per


every
 vote
 you
 get.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 the
 Tories
 will
 get
 the
 uh


largest
 benefit
 from
 this
 decision.
 Um,


but
 it
 is
 a
 bit
 more
 interesting
 in
 the


opposition
 benches
 where
 uh
 the
 Liberals


stand
 to
 get
 almost
 twice
 as
 much
 money


despite
 getting
 about
 half
 as
 many
 seats


in
 the
 legislature.
 Uh
 we
 we've


explained
 this
 several
 times
 on
 the


podcast,
 but
 I
 will
 just
 remind
 our
 our


listeners
 and
 viewers
 that
 the
 Liberals


got
 a
 larger
 share
 of
 the
 vote,
 but
 were


not
 rewarded
 for
 it
 because
 of
 the
 first


pass
 the
 post
 electoral
 system
 that
 we


have
 in
 the
 province.
 So,
 um,
 some


interesting
 mischief
 potentially
 there


between
 the
 Liberals
 and
 the
 NDP
 where,


uh,
 the
 NDP
 will
 continue
 to
 be
 the


largest
 party,
 sorry,
 largest
 of
 the


opposition
 parties,
 but
 they
 will
 not


see
 the
 largest
 benefit
 from
 the
 provoke


subsidy.
 Indeed.
 And
 with
 that,
 we're


off
 to
 your
 column,
 my
 column.


Okay,
 it's
 time
 now
 for
 our
 regular


feature,
 your
 column,
 my
 column,
 in


which
 JMM
 and
 I
 reminisce
 about
 what
 we


wrote
 for
 the
 TVO
 website
 over
 the
 past


week.
 We
 love
 it
 when
 you
 go
 on
 to
 the


tvO.org
 website
 and
 look
 for
 the
 stuff


that
 we
 wrote.
 We
 tease
 about
 it
 here,


but
 we
 write
 about
 it
 there.
 What
 do
 you


got
 for
 us
 this
 week?


>> So,
 tying
 a
 few
 things
 that
 we've


already
 spoken
 about
 today
 in
 the


podcast.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 we
 mentioned
 the


uh
 Quebec
 referendum
 and
 that
 that
 era


of,
 you
 know,
 the
 late
 ' 80s,
 early
 90s


uh,
 you
 know,
 constitutional
 revisions


that
 all
 of
 them
 uh
 failed
 and
 uh,
 but


they
 they
 left
 lasting
 scars
 on
 our


political
 class
 who
 uh,
 for
 basically


all
 of
 my
 adult
 life
 uh,
 everybody
 has


been
 absolutely
 terrified
 of
 the
 idea
 of


revising
 the
 constitution
 and
 uh,
 with


the
 news
 that
 the
 government
 is
 uh,
 you


know,
 removing
 the
 fixedterm
 uh
 election


date
 law.
 I
 would
 just
 like
 to
 urge


reformers,
 whatever
 your
 the
 reform
 you


have
 in
 mind
 is,
 if
 you
 want
 it
 to


stick,
 it's
 probably
 going
 to
 need
 uh


amending
 the
 constitution
 if
 you
 don't


want
 it
 to
 just
 leave
 it
 up
 to
 the
 next


government
 to
 undo
 at
 their
 whim.
 Uh


that's
 what
 the
 constitution
 is
 there


for.
 It's
 when
 we
 want
 to
 make
 uh
 some


uh
 changes
 that
 we
 want
 them
 to
 stick


around,
 right?
 Um,
 and
 we
 have
 to
 get


over
 this
 this
 terror
 of
 amending
 the


constitution.


>> We
 haven't
 gotten
 over
 it
 yet.


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 1995
 was
 30
 years
 ago


and
 the
 world
 belongs
 to
 the
 living,
 you


know.
 Um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 I
 I
 whatever


your
 issue
 is
 whether
 it
 is
 um
 you
 know


the
 relationship
 between
 the
 province


and
 municipalities
 uh
 school
 boards
 we


have
 a
 minister
 of
 education
 right
 now


who
 is
 saying
 that
 he
 might
 disestablish


the
 public
 English
 language
 school


boards
 but
 he
 would
 leave
 the
 Catholic


schoolboard
 system
 alone
 because
 of
 its


constitutional
 protections.
 Well
 that


section
 of
 the
 constitution
 can
 be


amended
 relatively
 easily.
 There's,
 you


know,
 section
 43
 of
 of
 the
 the
 1982


constitution
 allows
 Ontario
 to
 make


Ontario
 specific
 amendments
 in
 a
 pretty


straightforward
 manner.
 Other
 provinces


have
 done
 this.
 There
 have
 been
 eight


amendments
 to
 the
 constitution
 using


that
 section.
 Um,
 we
 we
 can
 make
 changes


if
 we
 want
 to.
 It
 will
 just
 require
 us


to
 uh
 screw
 up
 the
 courage
 and
 and
 get


over
 some
 of
 the
 bad
 memories
 of
 the


1990s.
 Um,
 on
 the
 specific
 issue
 of
 the


fixedterm
 election
 data,
 I
 say
 this
 in


the
 column,
 I
 will
 reiterate
 it
 here.


There
 are
 good
 reasons
 why
 we
 might
 not


want
 to
 do
 that.
 We
 might
 not
 want
 to


proceed
 with
 that.
 We
 might
 not
 want
 to


uh
 entrench
 that
 in
 the
 constitution.
 Uh


certainly
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 um
 the
 last


few
 years
 of
 the
 uh
 Brexit
 parliament
 uh


in
 the
 UK
 uh
 when
 it
 was
 uh
 the
 the
 the


Conservative
 party
 was
 dealing
 with
 all


sorts
 of
 crazy
 politics
 internally
 at


the
 same
 time
 as
 they
 they
 were
 still


governing
 under
 a
 fixedterm
 election


law.
 It
 was
 really
 really
 bad
 and
 really


really
 chaotic.
 And
 I
 and
 I
 think


there's
 a
 a
 very
 genuine
 serious


argument
 for
 why
 we
 would
 not
 want
 to


entrench
 a
 fixedterm
 election
 date
 law


in
 uh
 the
 Constitution.
 But
 there
 are


lots
 of
 other
 reforms
 that
 we
 might
 want


to
 make
 whether
 it's
 electoral
 reform


again
 some
 of
 the
 other
 ones
 I've


mentioned.
 Um
 and
 we
 just
 we
 gota
 we
 got


to
 get
 over
 our
 fears.
 What
 what
 a
 chair


say
 in
 the
 movie
 Moonruck
 when
 she


slapped
 Nick
 Cage
 on
 the
 face.


>> Snap
 out
 of
 it.
 Let's
 go.
 We
 can
 do
 this


if
 we
 want.


>> Well,
 I'll
 tell
 you
 what,
 JMM.
 Okay.


This
 was
 a
 great
 week
 for
 column


writing,
 for
 yours
 truly,
 because
 I
 got


to
 write
 about
 the
 two
 things
 that
 I


really
 love
 following
 the
 most
 in
 life,


and
 that
 is
 sports
 and
 politics
 in
 that


order.


>> Okay.
 Uh,
 okay.
 We're
 going
 to
 game
 six


in
 the
 World
 Series
 this
 year.
 And
 I


hearken
 back
 to
 the
 early
 1990s
 when
 in


1992
 the
 Jays
 won
 the
 World
 Series
 in


six
 games.
 And
 then
 in
 1993,
 the
 Jays


won
 the
 World
 Series
 in
 six
 games.
 And


of
 course,
 it
 was
 the
 Joe
 Carter
 home


run
 game
 uh
 that
 I
 wrote
 about
 this
 past


week
 because
 I
 was
 at
 that
 game
 sitting


in
 left
 field.
 The
 designated
 hitter
 for


the
 Jays
 that
 night
 was
 a
 guy
 named
 Paul


Moler
 and
 his
 in-laws
 were
 sitting


behind
 me
 and
 I
 spent
 a
 disturbing


amount
 of
 time
 during
 that
 game
 talking


about
 everything
 under
 the
 sun
 except


baseball
 with
 the
 Muller
 in-laws.
 I


don't
 know
 why.
 We
 even
 talked
 about


education
 policy
 in
 the
 province
 of


Ontario.
 I
 I
 can't
 quite
 remember
 how


this
 came
 up.
 I
 just
 do
 remember
 that
 it


happened.
 And
 then
 when
 Joe
 hit
 the
 home


run,
 only
 the
 second
 time
 in
 World


Series
 history
 that
 a
 walk-off
 home
 run


had
 been
 hit,
 meaning
 you
 hit
 the
 ball


out
 of
 the
 park,
 game
 over.


>> Um,
 I
 remember
 exactly
 what
 went
 through


my
 head.


And
 if
 you
 want
 to
 know,
 you
 got
 to
 read


the
 column.
 So
 go
 to
 the
 website,
 put


put
 go
 to
 the
 Google
 machine,
 put
 Steve


Pacin,
 Joe
 Carter,
 game
 six,
 uh,
 in


there,
 and
 you'll
 find
 out
 what
 I
 had
 to


write
 about.
 Now,
 I
 wrote
 a
 second


column
 this
 week
 about
 a
 guy
 who
 look
 at


I'm
 sure
 nobody
 who's
 watching
 us
 right


now
 has
 heard
 of
 this
 guy,
 which
 is
 all


the
 more
 reason
 why
 I
 wanted
 to
 write


about
 him
 because
 he's
 one
 of
 the
 most


fascinating,
 interesting,
 accomplished,


and
 educated
 men
 I've
 ever
 met
 in
 my


life.
 His
 name
 is
 Tim
 Reid.
 Tim
 was
 a


one-term,
 one-term
 only,
 MPP
 for
 Scarra


East,
 1967
 to
 1971.


He
 was
 a
 liberal.
 He
 sat
 in
 opposition.


John
 Roberts
 was
 the
 premier
 of
 the
 day.


He
 only
 won
 by
 a
 couple
 of
 hundred


votes.
 It
 was
 very
 narrow.
 And
 then
 in


1971
 when
 they
 had
 the
 subsequent


election,
 he
 only
 lost
 by
 a
 very
 narrow


margin
 as
 well.
 Actually
 lost
 to


Margaret
 Burch
 who
 would
 become
 the


first
 ever
 female
 cabinet
 minister
 in


Ontario
 history.
 You
 think
 Tim
 might
 be


broken
 up
 about
 losing
 that
 election


except
 that
 he
 got
 a
 job
 offer
 from
 the


Organization
 for
 Economic
 Cooperation


and
 Development
 in
 Paris
 immediately


thereafter.
 And
 I
 think
 he
 said
 he
 took


his
 wife
 about
 a
 half
 a
 second
 to


decide,
 do
 we
 stay
 in
 Scarbor
 or
 do
 we


move
 to
 Paris
 and
 work
 for
 the
 OECD?


That
 was
 not
 a
 tough
 one.
 Another
 reason


to
 love
 Tim,
 he
 played
 in
 the
 CFL.
 He


played
 for
 the
 Hamilton
 Tiger
 Cats
 in


the
 1960s.


>> Oh,
 that's
 why
 we're
 talking
 about
 this.


>> Well,
 that
 might
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 to
 do


with
 it.
 But
 you
 know
 what?
 He
 played
 in


probably
 the
 most
 historic
 Gay
 Cup
 game


ever,
 1962.


It
 was
 called
 the
 Fog
 Bowl
 because
 it


was
 this
 was,
 you
 know,
 obviously
 well


before
 the
 Dome,
 well
 before
 Bimo
 Field.


Uh
 they
 played
 gay
 cups
 at
 and
 the
 Argos


played
 at
 CN
 Stadium,
 Exhibition


Stadium.
 And
 that
 day
 the
 fog
 came
 off


Lake
 Ontario
 and
 completely
 enveloped


the
 stadium.
 You
 couldn't
 see
 a
 thing.


It
 was
 so
 foggy
 they
 actually
 had
 to


call
 the
 game
 and
 finish
 it
 the
 next


day.
 And
 the
 game
 was
 im
 uh
 excuse
 me
 uh


immortalized
 on
 a
 Canada
 Post
 stamp.


>> Oh,
 lovely.
 And
 you
 can
 see
 there's
 Tim


Reed
 trying
 to
 tackle
 a
 running
 back
 for


the
 Winnipeg
 Blue
 Bombers
 on
 the
 stamp.


The
 quarterback
 of
 the
 Bombers,
 Kenny


Plane,
 is
 in
 the
 foreground,
 but
 you
 see


Tim
 make
 trying
 to
 make
 a
 tackle
 in
 the


background.
 So
 he's
 there
 for
 all
 time.


JMM,
 if
 you
 can
 imagine
 this,
 this
 guy


had
 degrees
 from
 Yale,
 from
 Oxford,
 from


Harvard.
 He
 went
 to
 all
 of
 those


post-secondary
 institutions.
 when
 he
 was


at
 Queens
 Park,
 he
 loved
 education,


really
 cared
 a
 lot
 about
 education


policy,
 and
 it
 used
 to
 grind
 his
 gears


that
 the
 textbooks
 that
 Canadian
 and


Ontario
 kids
 used
 in
 classes
 were


published
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 had


American
 values,
 had
 no
 understanding
 of


Canadian/Ontario


nuances,
 culturally,
 politically,
 um,


and
 he
 railed
 against
 that
 and
 and
 took


efforts
 to
 ensure
 that
 our
 textbooks


would
 be
 printed
 here
 in
 Ontario
 with


some
 understanding
 of
 how
 we
 did


I'll
 say
 a
 few
 more
 things
 about
 him.
 He


helped
 establish
 York
 University.
 He


taught
 at
 York
 University.
 He
 taught
 at


the
 business
 school.
 I
 think
 he
 was
 the


dean
 actually
 at
 the
 business
 school
 of


what
 was
 then
 called
 Ryerson,
 now


Toronto
 Metropolitan
 University.
 He


worked
 in
 the
 public
 service
 in
 Ottawa,


working
 his
 way
 up
 to
 becoming
 an


assistant
 deputy
 minister.
 He
 was


president
 of
 the
 Canadian
 Chamber
 of


Commerce.
 He
 was
 on
 governing
 council
 at


the
 University
 of
 Toronto.
 He
 was
 the


chair
 of
 Ontario
 Lottery
 and
 Gaming.


This
 guy
 was
 a
 complete
 Renaissance
 man


and
 a
 lovely
 guy.
 And
 he
 just
 died


earlier
 this
 month,
 four
 months
 shy
 of


90
 years
 old,
 having
 lived
 an
 absolutely


superlative
 life.
 Tim
 Reid,
 a
 one-term


MPP
 and
 a
 guy
 who
 left
 footprints.
 A


wonderful
 man.
 With
 that,
 let's
 go
 to


the
 mailbag.


>> If
 you've
 got
 a
 burning
 question
 or


insightful
 comment,
 you
 know,
 we
 love
 to


hear
 from
 you
 at
 onpolitics
 tvo.org.
 or


JMM,
 take
 us
 through
 this
 week's
 note.


>> Uh,
 this
 week
 we
 have
 physical
 mail
 from


listener
 Paul
 Vanderham
 from
 Missaga.


Now,
 uh,
 audience
 might
 remember
 that


name.
 He
 emailed
 us
 back
 in
 December


2024
 about
 the
 Ontario
 official
 road
 map


and
 asked
 if
 we
 could
 find
 out
 if
 there


would
 be
 a
 new
 edition
 printed
 and
 now


there
 has
 been
 a
 new
 edition
 and
 he
 has


sent
 us
 those
 uh,
 printed
 maps.
 Look
 at


this.
 Fantastic.
 Okay,
 there
 we
 go.


Right
 there.


>> There
 we
 go.
 We
 have
 actual
 Now,
 of


course,
 everybody
 uses
 GPS
 nowadays,
 but


we
 have
 actual
 maps.
 Yes,


>> this
 is
 exciting.


>> I
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 own
 a
 car,
 but
 I
 will


keep
 this
 in
 my
 go
 bag.
 Um,
 thank
 you,


Paul.
 Uh,
 now
 Paul
 mentioned
 in
 his
 note


that
 the
 Bradford
 bypass
 is
 shown
 on
 the


map
 as
 being
 under
 construction,
 while


Highway
 413
 is
 not.
 So,
 uh,
 people


reading
 the
 tea
 leaves,
 uh,
 can
 enjoy


that.


>> Um,
 if
 you
 are
 looking
 to
 purchase
 a


copy
 of
 the
 map,
 you
 can
 do
 so
 at
 the


Ontario
 Publication
 Site
 for
 $4.95.


I
 want
 to
 tell
 you
 before
 GPS
 how
 we


used
 to
 drive.


This
 is
 not
 a
 word
 of
 a
 lie.
 You
 would


get
 into
 your
 car.
 You
 would
 open
 up
 the


map
 like
 this
 and
 you
 would
 spllay
 it


right.


>> Yes.


>> On
 the
 steering
 wheel
 while
 you
 were


driving
 and
 you'd
 have
 one
 hand
 on
 your


map
 and
 you
 would
 have
 another
 hand
 as


you
 were
 driving
 your
 car
 and
 you
 would


watch.
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 really
 a
 fantastic


detailed
 map
 of
 the
 highway
 system
 in


the
 province
 of
 Ontario.
 This
 was
 the


very
 safe
 way
 that
 we
 used
 to
 drive


before
 GPS.
 And
 then
 of
 course


>> with
 open
 bourbon
 and
 cigarettes.


>> Well,
 I
 won't
 go
 that
 far.
 But
 then
 if


you
 were
 really
 talented
 and

pressure's

 I
 don't
 know if
 I
 can
 do


it
 here.
 You
 would
 absolutely
 when

got
 to
 your
 destination
 be
 able
 to
 fold


the
 map
 back
 up.
 Can
 I
 do
 it
 here?
 Can
 I


do
 it?

 it
 would
 be

ready
 for
 next
 time.

 we
 go.

still
 got
 it.

 were
 beautiful,

 have
 to
 admit
 GPS
 is

 this
 is,
 but

 there's


something
 sweet
 about
 the
 good
 old


highway
 highway
 road
 maps

the
 day.
