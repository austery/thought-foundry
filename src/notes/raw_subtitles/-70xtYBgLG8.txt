today
 I'm
 here
 with
 uh
 Tony
 Shu
 um


pretty
 amazing
 actually
 you
 came
 from
 uh


China
 really
 young
 worked
 very
 hard
 did


all
 kinds
 of
 jobs
 you
 know
 got
 to


Stanford
 uh
 started
 uh
 you
 know
 this


incredible
 company
 which
 is
 now
 kind
 of


the
 biggest
 food
 delivery
 company
 in
 in


America
 about
 to
 conquer
 the
 world
 made


billions
 giv
 lots
 of
 them
 away
 and


philanthropy
 I
 mean
 basically
 I'm


sitting
 her
 in
 front
 of
 the
 American


dream
 what
 are
 you
 what
 are
 your


Reflections
 about
 your
 J
 well


I
 I
 I
 think
 that
 it's
 impossible
 to


predict
 how
 things
 go
 for
 you
 you
 know


as
 you
 think
 about
 these
 things
 I
 think


it's
 you
 know
 as
 you
 recounted
 that
 list


of
 experiences
 it's
 only
 one
 that
 can
 be


told
 backwards
 it's
 not
 one
 that
 when
 I


was
 you
 know
 moing
 Lawns
 and
 at
 the
 age


of
 seven
 trying
 to
 save
 up
 money
 for


Nintendo
 games
 or
 duck
 Hunts
 uh
 or


washing
 dishes
 in
 my
 Mom's
 restaurant


could
 I
 have
 predicted
 what
 would
 have


happened
 later
 on
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 just


you
 know
 how
 incredible
 you
 know
 can
 can


be
 if
 you
 you
 know
 put
 your
 mind
 to


things
 work
 hard
 and
 get


lucky
 how
 hard
 have
 you


worked
 probably
 not
 as
 hard
 as
 as
 as
 as


a
 lot
 of
 people
 but
 um
 now
 I've
 been


very
 fortunate
 you
 know
 I
 I
 I
 think
 that


working
 hard
 certainly
 is
 something
 that


has
 um
 always
 really
 been
 in
 my
 family
 I


mean
 I
 think
 this
 really
 comes
 from
 my


parents
 right
 both
 of
 them
 came
 to
 the


US
 um
 brought
 me
 from
 China
 to
 Illinois


when
 I
 was
 five
 and
 you
 know
 I
 really


didn't
 get
 to
 see
 them
 that
 much
 not


because
 of
 neglect
 or
 anything
 but


because
 they
 were
 trying
 to
 put
 food
 on


the
 table
 we
 came
 to
 the
 US
 with
 $250
 in


the
 bank
 and
 my
 dad
 was
 a
 full-time


waiter
 as
 he
 was
 getting
 his
 PhD
 my
 mom


was
 working
 three
 jobs
 a
 day
 for
 you


know
 12
 years
 before
 she
 actually
 can


save
 up
 enough
 money
 to
 you
 know


practice
 what
 she
 always
 wanted
 to
 do


which
 was
 open
 up
 a
 medical
 clinic
 but


it
 took
 a
 while
 for
 her
 family
 to
 kind


of
 get
 our
 foundation
 and
 footing
 in
 the


US
 but
 you
 know
 thanks
 to
 them
 I
 got
 to


you
 know
 really
 live
 off
 of
 the
 fruits


of
 their
 labor
 and
 um
 you
 know
 carve
 out


my
 own
 path
 and
 what
 do
 you
 think
 what


do
 you
 think
 it
 does
 to
 Ambitions
 to


come
 from
 kind
 of
 uh
 you
 know
 to
 work
 to


work
 one's
 way
 up
 like
 that
 I
 think
 it


can
 have
 multiple
 effects
 you
 know
 I


think
 sometimes
 when
 you
 grow
 up
 in
 a


situation
 where
 you
 don't
 necessarily


see
 a
 lot
 of
 outs
 or
 a
 lot
 of
 ways
 to


progress
 your
 current
 situation
 that
 can


be
 somewhat
 demotivating
 but
 at
 the
 same


time
 I
 think
 um
 you
 know
 it
 also
 gives


you
 a
 lot
 of
 Independence
 you
 know
 when


I
 was
 a
 kid
 I
 spent
 most
 of
 the
 time
 by


myself
 right
 I
 learned
 English
 by


playing
 basketball
 and
 watching
 TV
 you


know
 I
 named
 myself
 Tony
 after
 Tony


Danza
 you
 know
 from
 who's
 the
 boss
 and


and
 that
 you
 did
 on
 your
 own


inititive
 found
 extraordinary
 well


nobody
 could
 pronounce
 my
 name
 you
 know


nobody
 could
 pronounce
 my
 Chinese
 name


that
 is
 and
 so
 but
 but
 you
 know
 from


from
 being


independent
 you
 know
 early
 on
 um
 you


know
 I
 learned
 both
 about
 good
 good


decisions
 and
 and
 bad
 decisions
 right


and
 I
 think
 um
 it
 put
 me
 in
 environments


where
 I
 had
 to
 be
 quite
 agile
 um
 you


know
 to
 to
 adapt
 to
 whatever
 the


circumstances
 I
 I
 changed
 schools
 a
 lot


when
 I
 was
 a
 kid
 growing
 up
 because
 my


parents
 were
 always
 trying
 to
 progress


our
 economic
 situation
 so
 that
 I
 can


attend
 better
 schools
 I
 moved
 probably


four
 or
 five
 schools
 in
 my
 you
 know


Elementary
 to
 middle
 school
 years
 um
 and


as
 a
 result
 I
 think
 of
 those
 experiences


it
 it
 it
 it
 wasn't
 as
 if
 like
 it


increased
 massively
 my
 levels
 of


ambition
 but
 it's
 certainly
 increased


the
 practice
 at
 a
 very
 young
 age
 for


independent
 thinking
 so
 first
 of
 all


what
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 uh
 what
 do
 you


think
 it
 means
 to
 change
 School
 s
 and
 we


we
 we
 hear
 that
 from
 C
 from
 some
 various


CEOs
 that
 they
 moved
 quite
 a
 bit
 they


talk
 about
 it
 uh
 as
 helping
 their


agility
 and
 so
 on
 what
 what
 are
 your


what
 what
 is
 your
 view
 on


that
 well
 I
 think
 it's
 pretty
 tough
 you


know
 to
 to
 to
 know
 this
 when
 you're
 you


know
 a
 very
 young
 person
 um


but
 you
 know
 I
 guess
 looking
 backwards


it
 almost
 always
 made
 you
 appreciate


feeling
 like
 what
 it
 meant
 to
 be
 the


outsider
 um
 or
 the
 underdog
 if
 you
 will


right
 you're
 always
 in
 the
 out
 Community


before
 you
 can
 become
 a
 member
 of
 the
 in


community
 in
 terms
 of
 you
 know
 gaining


friendship
 or
 you
 know
 getting


privileged
 to
 certain
 circles
 inside
 the


school
 um
 but
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it
 you
 know


for
 me
 it
 taught
 me
 that
 you
 know


there's
 value
 in
 every
 interaction
 that


you
 can
 be
 friends
 with
 people
 in
 a


school
 that's
 known
 for
 teen
 pregnancy


sadly
 or
 a
 school
 that's
 known
 for


gifted
 children
 or
 everything
 in
 between


and
 I
 think
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that
 it
 just


increased
 the
 rate
 at
 which
 I
 learned


probably
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 intentionally


knew
 this
 when
 I
 was
 a
 child
 um
 but


whether
 it
 was
 you
 know
 playing
 lots
 of


basketball
 or
 doing
 lots
 of
 math
 and
 um


you
 know
 I
 got
 to
 play
 in
 different


spheres
 and
 I
 think
 you
 know
 probably


develop
 in
 a
 way
 that
 was
 you
 know
 quite


healthy
 um
 it
 you
 know
 again
 showed
 me


the
 value
 of
 interaction
 every


interaction
 um
 that
 there
 is
 a


superpower
 in
 everybody
 uh
 and
 to
 look


for
 that
 and
 I
 think
 if
 you
 can
 do
 that


collectively
 you
 can
 do
 great
 things


what
 were
 the
 important
 steps
 before
 you


started
 as


Stanford
 well
 one
 of
 the
 first
 moments
 I


I
 remember
 in
 adulthood
 is
 really


graduating
 from
 college
 where
 my


background
 was
 in
 math
 I
 wanted
 to
 be
 a


cancer
 researcher


and
 so
 I
 did
 lots
 of
 work
 in
 Labs
 um


where
 the
 work
 was
 done
 at
 the


intersection
 of
 mathematics
 and
 biology


you
 know
 it
 was
 a
 fairly
 young
 field
 at


the
 time
 maybe
 20
 to
 30
 years
 old
 or


something
 like
 that
 today
 I
 I
 think
 it's


quite
 Advanced
 especially
 with
 the


recent
 developments
 in
 large
 language


models
 compute
 AI
 um
 but
 back
 then
 I
 I


think
 it
 was
 it
 was
 just
 kind
 of
 in
 its


Inception
 or
 its
 formation
 um
 and
 I


thought
 I
 was
 going
 to
 do
 that
 and
 and


and
 and
 do
 and
 pursue
 graduate
 step


studies
 and
 and
 and
 all
 of
 that
 jazz
 um


but
 my
 world
 actually
 180d
 um
 at


graduation
 where
 I
 decided
 to
 not
 um


start
 the
 graduate
 program
 in
 which
 I


was
 accepted
 um
 but
 instead
 uh
 180
 into


a
 world
 of
 business
 which
 I
 had
 no


experience
 in
 I
 had
 why
 did
 that
 happen


well
 I
 in
 one
 of
 the
 um
 uh
 admit
 weekend


activities
 where
 you
 get
 to
 visit
 you


know
 the
 lab
 that
 you
 would
 be
 you
 know


a
 part
 of
 I
 realized
 that
 you
 know
 of


the
 four
 or
 five
 students
 that
 would
 be


um
 members
 of
 that
 lab
 I
 didn't
 feel
 the


most
 committed
 and
 for
 something
 that


would
 be
 a
 12year
 journey
 actually
 that


would
 have
 been
 a
 12-year
 Journey
 um
 as


a
 21-year-old
 um
 I
 you
 know
 made
 the


decision
 that
 I
 you
 know
 that
 there


might
 be
 something
 else
 for
 me
 now
 that


was
 quite
 scary
 for
 me
 at
 the
 time
 where


I
 think
 you
 know
 for
 a
 while
 especially


in
 the
 world
 of
 academics
 um
 it's
 a


fairly
 straight
 laced
 um
 well
 understood


set
 of
 progressions
 that
 you
 can
 take
 um


into
 getting
 to
 you
 know
 greater
 and


greater
 Specialties
 where
 you
 have
 to


concentrate
 on
 an
 area
 for
 a
 long
 period


of
 time
 before
 you
 know
 you
 um
 make
 a


large
 or
 significant
 contribution
 um
 but


for
 me
 um
 I
 I
 took
 I
 suppose
 at
 the
 time


the
 path
 Less
 Traveled
 which
 was
 doing


something
 I've
 never
 done
 before
 you


know
 when
 I
 joined
 MacKenzie
 out
 of


college
 I
 remember
 showing
 up
 um
 in
 the


first
 week
 in
 t-shirts
 and
 genes
 and
 I


didn't
 understand
 what
 business
 casual


aware
 meant
 I
 didn't
 know
 what
 Microsoft


Excel
 was
 I
 didn't
 know
 what
 PowerPoint


was
 I
 barely
 understood
 the
 word
 Revenue


you
 know
 my
 background
 was
 more
 in
 the


intersection
 of
 mathematics
 and
 and


biology
 you
 must
 have
 learned
 science


you
 must
 have
 picked
 this
 up
 pretty
 fast


done
 well
 yeah
 you
 know
 thanks
 to
 the


awesome
 teammates
 and
 and
 colleagues
 I


had
 of
 I
 did
 but
 but
 you
 know
 I
 think
 it


it
 what
 that
 experience
 taught
 me
 was


that
 I
 think
 for
 me
 to
 have
 gone
 to


Berkeley
 which
 is
 where
 I
 completed
 my


undergraduate


studies
 that
 in
 many
 ways
 life
 had


already
 given
 me
 so
 much
 more
 than
 maybe


what
 it's
 given
 some
 other
 people
 that


I'm
 going
 to
 be
 okay
 and
 and
 I
 think


that
 had
 a
 pretty
 formative
 opinion
 um


for
 me
 in
 terms
 of
 just
 something
 to


remind
 me
 that
 it's
 probably
 okay
 to


take
 you
 know
 more
 risk
 and
 the
 fact


that
 McKenzie
 actually
 worked
 out
 pretty


well
 for
 me
 um
 just
 you
 know
 added
 more


confirmation
 to
 that
 bias
 what
 did
 you


do
 at
 Stanford


then
 I
 think
 Stanford
 was
 a
 fantastic


um
 journey
 into
 thinking
 about
 actually


myself
 more
 so
 than
 developing


necessarily
 professional


skills
 and
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 that
 is
 um
 on


one
 hand
 I
 thought
 it
 it
 was
 a
 fairly


you
 know
 expensive
 use
 of
 time
 I
 don't


necessarily
 just
 mean
 in
 terms
 of


tuition
 or
 or
 things
 like
 this
 but
 you


know
 you're
 sometimes
 your
 most


productive
 in
 your
 20s
 and
 so
 those


disproportionately
 expensive
 years
 of
 my


career
 um
 but
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 you
 know


the
 thesis
 that
 that
 I
 had
 made
 for


Stanford
 U
 or
 or
 just
 for
 business


school
 I
 should
 say
 in
 general
 um
 was


really
 to
 think
 you
 know
 what
 are
 what


are
 other
 types
 of
 skills
 that
 I
 want
 to


develop
 as
 well
 as
 what
 are
 um
 things


that
 you
 know
 I
 I
 I
 truly
 would
 want
 to


go
 and
 do
 um
 and
 and
 and
 to
 take
 you


know
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 time
 away


from
 just
 you
 know
 working
 hard
 every


single
 day
 um
 to
 actually
 go
 and
 figure


that
 out
 and
 the
 skills
 that
 you
 wanted


to
 acquire
 there
 what
 were
 they
 well
 so


you
 know
 when
 when
 I
 thought


about
 my
 journey
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 journey


whether
 it's
 growing
 up
 as
 an
 only
 child


and
 then
 moving
 around
 a
 lot
 um
 or


moving
 in
 high
 school
 from
 Illinois
 to


California
 um
 or
 um
 even
 working
 in
 a


lab
 you
 know
 in


research
 most
 or
 as
 working
 as
 an


analyst
 at
 McKenzie
 or
 um
 or
 or
 or
 or
 at


eBay
 most
 of
 those
 work
 experiences
 were


um
 isolated
 experiences
 or
 or
 or
 or
 very


solo
 Journeys
 if
 you
 will
 where
 most
 of


my
 contributions
 um
 were
 measured
 by


what
 I
 individually
 contributed
 right


and
 and
 I
 learned
 a
 lot
 by
 doing


hopefully
 what
 was
 considered
 great
 work


um
 and
 and
 uh
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I


also
 learned
 that
 great
 things
 you
 know


get
 accomplished
 with


teams
 and
 I
 didn't
 have
 that
 much


experience
 working
 with
 other
 people
 now


business
 school
 you
 know
 in
 of
 itself


does
 not
 offer
 that
 but
 you
 know


particularly
 at
 Stanford
 there
 was
 this


emphasis
 um
 that
 you
 know
 working
 well


with
 others
 and
 figuring
 out
 how
 to


motivate
 you
 know
 not
 just
 people
 that


are
 similar
 to
 you
 or
 motivated


similarly
 the
 way
 that
 I'm
 motivated
 um


that
 was
 a
 big
 um
 selling
 point
 of
 uh


the
 curriculum
 and
 it's
 something
 that


uh
 I
 still
 try
 to
 get
 better
 at
 every


day
 now
 then
 you
 um
 set
 up
 with
 some


friends
 what
 was
 then
 Paulo
 Alto


delivery
 and
 now
 door
 Dash
 how
 did
 you


come
 up
 with
 that
 y
 air
 yeah
 so
 all
 of


us
 came
 together
 because
 we
 were
 excited


about
 local
 businesses
 that's
 the


motivating
 theme
 for
 each
 of
 us
 and
 I


know
 A
 lot's
 been
 told
 about
 my


background
 but
 if
 you
 were
 to
 look
 at


the
 backgrounds
 of
 my
 co-founders
 and


their
 family
 histories
 you
 know
 they


also
 have
 experience
 with
 small
 business


too
 and
 so
 the
 four
 of
 us
 kind
 of
 spoke


with
 hundreds
 of
 local
 business
 owners


you
 know
 some
 of
 these
 people
 were


restaurant
 tours
 others
 sold
 retail


items


and
 it
 was
 interesting
 when
 we
 asked


them
 hey
 show
 us
 all
 of
 what
 you
 do
 in
 a


day
 that
 when
 we
 followed
 them
 around
 um


there
 was
 this
 one
 Baker
 um
 who
 ran
 a


macaroon
 shop
 on
 University
 Avenue
 in


pal
 Alto
 um
 who
 showed
 us
 a
 booklet
 of


delivery
 orders
 she
 had
 she
 had
 refused


which
 to
 us
 was
 quite
 surprising
 you


know
 a
 that
 you
 would
 turn
 down
 people


wanting
 to
 pay
 you
 and
 B
 the


significance
 of
 that
 decision
 given
 the


fact
 that
 she
 was
 a
 oneperson
 shop
 and


that
 you
 know
 those
 orders
 really
 were


the
 difference
 of
 making
 payroll
 or


having
 some
 extra
 padded
 you
 know


insurance
 money
 you
 know
 for
 the


business
 and
 and
 so
 we
 started
 um
 you


know
 from
 that
 Discovery
 talking
 to
 more


businesses
 about
 this
 issue
 and
 and
 it


was
 surprising
 this
 was
 2013
 that
 while


delivery
 was
 not
 a
 new


idea
 that
 no
 one
 in
 America
 outside
 of


pizza
 places
 um
 or
 certain
 cities
 like


New
 York
 City
 offer
 delivery
 and
 that


was
 true
 in
 restaurants
 and
 that
 was


certainly
 true
 Beyond
 restaurants
 so


then
 you
 sit
 down
 with
 your
 with
 your


mates
 and
 figured
 okay
 let's
 start
 at


company
 well
 well
 so
 there
 are
 few
 there


are
 a
 few
 things
 that
 we
 were
 thinking


about
 and
 and
 so
 we
 said
 okay
 well
 if


our
 goal
 is
 to
 help
 local
 businesses
 and


we
 found
 this
 discovery
 that
 delivery


could
 be
 a
 need
 the
 question
 is
 well
 do


consumers
 actually
 want
 this
 product


because
 you
 know
 we
 live
 in
 a
 very


capitalistic
 Market
 in
 the
 US
 and
 so
 a


lot
 of
 times
 business
 ideas
 um
 perhaps


were
 not
 started
 because
 nobody
 wanted


them
 to
 be
 started
 and


and
 so
 you
 know
 we
 wanted
 to
 test
 a
 few


different
 ideas
 you
 know
 the
 first
 is
 do


consumers
 actually
 want
 delivery
 from


stores
 that
 never
 offer
 delivery
 before


you
 know
 second
 would
 stores
 actually


want
 to
 partner
 with
 us
 and
 you
 know
 pay


us
 you
 know
 to
 help
 them
 get
 new


customers
 and
 three
 could
 we
 attract
 and


recruit
 you
 know
 a
 group
 of
 drivers
 who


would
 be
 willing
 to
 work
 for
 a
 wage
 that


we
 could
 afford
 and
 so
 that
 was
 really


how
 we
 thought
 about
 it
 in
 many
 ways
 it


was
 a
 hypothesis
 of
 what
 needed
 to
 be


true
 in
 order
 to
 start
 the
 company
 and


then
 the
 reason
 why
 we
 chose
 restaurants


was
 because
 we
 thought
 well
 if
 delivery


was
 going
 to
 be
 the
 way
 in
 which
 we
 made


a
 difference
 for
 local
 businesses
 and
 we


wanted
 to
 build
 the
 largest
 um
 you
 know


delivery
 Network
 or
 and
 with
 the
 highest


quality
 and
 the
 lowest
 cost
 well
 you


need
 the
 most
 amount
 of
 order
 density


and
 with
 order
 density
 you
 kind
 of
 need


two
 things
 you
 need
 lots
 of
 frequency
 of


activity
 and
 you
 need
 lots
 of
 coverage


so
 one


uh
 of
 these
 two
 um
 requirements
 was
 an


observation
 we
 made
 and
 the
 other
 was
 a


bet
 so
 the
 observation
 we
 made
 was
 if


you
 looked
 across
 every
 category
 of


local
 retail
 in
 America
 restaurants
 has


the
 highest
 count
 of
 stores
 it
 didn't
 at


that
 time
 have
 the
 highest
 dollar
 spend


but
 there's
 a
 million
 restaurants
 as
 an


an
 example
 versus
 say
 just
 you
 know
 a


couple
 hundred
 thousand
 grocery
 stores


as
 a
 as
 a
 Counterpoint
 um
 so
 that's
 why


we
 started
 with
 restaurants
 but
 and
 the


bet
 would
 be
 that
 if
 you
 can
 start
 with


restaurants
 that
 there
 would
 be
 the
 most


frequency
 of
 activity
 with
 the
 most


number
 of
 stores
 that
 that
 would


generate
 the
 most
 order
 density
 which


would
 make
 it
 easier
 to
 build
 the
 last


mile
 Network
 for
 any
 other
 category
 tell


me
 about
 the
 first
 order
 you
 got
 the


first
 order
 we
 got
 actually
 happened
 on


a
 Saturday
 January
 12th
 um
 2013
 so
 we
 um


shipped
 pal
 alod
 delivery.com
 okay
 this


was
 the
 most
 minimal
 version
 of
 a


minimal
 viable
 product
 where
 in
 45


minutes
 we
 built
 a
 website
 with
 eight


PDF
 menus
 right
 there's
 no
 way
 to
 order


the
 only
 way
 you
 can
 order
 is
 to
 call
 a


Google
 Voice
 number
 that
 rang
 the
 cell


phones
 of
 the
 four
 Founders
 yeah
 so
 a


customer
 in
 in
 Meno
 Park
 actually
 placed


an
 order
 I
 think
 the
 only
 way
 he
 found


us
 because
 the
 order
 was
 placed
 45


minutes
 or
 so
 after
 we
 launched
 the


website
 was
 literally
 by
 typing
 in
 Palo


alod
 delivery.com
 in
 the
 browser
 because


Google
 I
 don't
 think
 would
 have
 you
 know


indexed
 our
 our
 name
 at
 the
 point
 yet
 um


but
 he
 placed
 um
 you
 know
 for
 himself
 a


you
 know
 an
 order
 from
 Bangkok
 Cuisine


um
 and
 and
 and
 and
 it
 was
 it
 was
 two


items
 it
 was
 um
 chicken
 Pat
 thae
 and
 it


was
 spring
 rolls
 and
 so
 pretty
 good


basically
 it
 sounded
 delicious
 so
 he


Rings
 he
 he
 he
 he
 calls
 in
 I
 I
 one
 of
 my


co-founders
 answers
 he's
 in
 the
 car
 with


me
 I'm
 in
 my
 2001
 Honda
 at
 the
 time
 and


we
 are
 literally
 um
 you
 know
 about
 to


drive
 home
 you
 know
 from
 from
 campus
 but


instead
 we
 detour


and
 go
 to
 Bangkok
 Cuisine
 place
 a


takeout
 order
 bring
 the
 order
 to
 his


house
 so
 you
 did
 it
 yourself
 we
 did
 it


ourselves
 and
 then
 we
 um
 went
 in
 and
 and


I
 I
 I
 was
 an
 intern
 um
 the
 previous


summer
 at
 square
 and
 so
 I
 had
 a
 lot
 of


these
 Square
 card
 readers
 it
 at
 the
 time


it
 was
 this
 white
 register
 product
 that


you
 can
 insert
 into
 the
 Jack
 of
 the


iPhone
 and
 so
 that's
 how
 we
 accept
 the


payments
 what
 did
 you
 feel
 it
 was


awesome
 it
 was
 uh
 it
 was
 in
 some
 ways


not
 believable
 that
 somehow
 he
 found
 us


we
 were
 shocked
 he
 found
 us
 you
 know
 um


so
 I
 and
 and
 and
 you
 know
 as
 as
 they
 say


with
 you
 know
 entrepreneurial
 Journeys


um
 you
 may
 have
 this
 amazing
 feeling
 of


euphoria
 when
 when
 you
 launch
 and
 then


quickly
 that's
 followed
 by
 a
 trough
 of


Sorrow
 the
 trough
 of
 Sorrow
 followed


pretty
 quickly
 thereafter
 where
 you
 know


it
 wasn't
 that
 easy
 to
 get
 you
 know
 the


next
 set
 of
 orders
 for
 the
 first
 few


months
 and
 how
 did
 it
 so
 how
 did
 it


scale
 I
 mean
 how
 yeah
 what
 happened
 yeah


so
 we
 effectively
 were
 a
 delivery


service
 at
 the
 time
 for
 the
 Stanford


campus
 right
 so
 we're
 still
 students
 you


got
 to
 remember
 at
 the
 time
 um
 and
 so


we're
 students
 we're
 running
 the
 service


so
 we're
 taking
 classes
 you
 know
 in
 the


daytime
 and
 at
 lunch
 we
 take
 turns
 you


know
 doing
 deliveries
 we
 would
 call
 and


take
 turns
 dispatching
 by
 calling
 in
 the


orders
 and
 then
 using
 find
 my
 friends


the
 iPhone
 app
 to
 track
 where
 you
 know


each
 of
 us
 four
 founder
 drivers
 were


we're
 the
 only
 drivers
 you
 you
 know
 of


the
 service
 were
 and
 then
 we
 would


dispatch
 the
 orders
 ourselves
 right
 um


we
 were
 the
 human
 algorithm
 you
 know


behind
 the
 scene
 and
 um
 we
 we
 did
 this


for
 about
 four
 or
 five
 months
 before
 we


um
 applied
 to
 Y
 combinator
 and
 um
 we


launched
 uh
 officially
 as
 door
 Dash
 June


21st
 of
 2013
 in
 the
 summer
 2013
 batch


out
 of
 YC
 how
 many
 deliveries
 do
 you


have
 now
 per
 year
 per
 year
 I
 I
 I
 believe


the
 last
 reported
 number
 is
 is
 is
 in
 the


billions
 um
 but
 uh
 so
 from
 one
 to


billions
 yeah
 when
 you
 when
 you
 set
 it


up
 what
 was
 kind
 of
 the
 the
 Dre
 The


Dream
 what
 what
 was
 the
 biggest
 that
 you


thought
 could
 happen
 to
 this
 so
 it's


funny
 you
 ask
 that
 question
 because


that's
 literally
 the
 question
 why


commentator
 asks
 you
 in
 the
 application


so
 I
 wrote
 the
 application
 just
 to
 feel


that
 why
 commentator
 that's
 Sam
 that's


samman's
 at
 one
 point
 right
 yeah
 so
 so


so
 Paul
 Graham
 Jessica
 Livingston
 and


others
 founded
 why
 combinator
 um
 which


is
 this
 incubator
 program
 in
 Silicon


Valley
 um
 that
 helps
 you
 know
 start


companies
 um
 uh
 Sam
 mman
 to
 your
 point


um
 at
 one
 point
 ran
 YC
 today
 Gary
 tan


leads
 YC
 um
 and
 uh
 but
 one
 of
 the


questions
 um
 as
 as
 part
 certainly
 in
 the


2013
 era
 that
 they
 asked
 in
 the


application
 was
 how
 big
 can
 this
 service


be
 or
 how
 big
 can
 your
 product
 be
 how


much
 revenue
 do
 you
 think
 you'll
 earn
 by


year
 seven
 or
 I
 think
 it
 was
 some


version
 of
 the
 question
 and
 I
 think
 at


the
 time
 for
 Consumer
 companies
 we
 were


we
 were
 studying
 you
 know
 achieving
 a


100
 million
 I
 dollar
 of
 Revenue
 was
 a


very
 significant
 Milestone
 and
 so
 I
 just


remember


writing
 uh
 you
 know
 doing
 some
 sanity


math
 about
 well
 today
 we
 launched
 in


paloalto
 or
 we
 operate
 in
 paloalto
 how


many
 paloalto
 do
 there
 have
 to
 exist
 and


how
 many
 orders
 in
 each
 pal
 Alto
 do
 we


have
 to
 complete
 such
 that
 we
 can


generate
 $100
 million
 of
 Revenue
 and


that
 was
 the
 math
 I
 remember
 answering


so
 $100
 million
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 I


answered
 thankfully
 I
 was
 off
 by
 a


couple
 orders
 of
 magnitude
 dude
 um
 but


you
 know
 these
 are
 things
 that
 are
 hard


to


predict
 so
 what
 what
 are
 the
 important


Milestones
 from
 that
 stage
 until
 now


there
 are
 many
 along
 the
 way
 you
 know


and
 I
 think
 it
 you
 know
 it
 it
 really


helped
 that
 when
 we
 started
 the
 company


we
 did
 have
 this
 organizing
 framework


that
 was
 really
 centered
 on
 our


audiences
 our
 customers
 right
 so
 we
 have


we
 have
 three
 kinds
 of
 customers
 we
 have


consumers
 we
 have
 Merchants
 at
 the
 time


there
 were
 restaurants
 today
 they
 span


all
 of
 retail
 and
 then
 there
 are
 um


there
 are
 Dashers
 the
 drivers
 on
 our


platform
 and
 we
 really
 you
 know
 for
 door


Das
 to
 work
 from
 day
 one
 we
 had
 this
 you


know
 belief
 that
 it
 has
 to
 work
 for
 all


of
 these
 audiences
 it
 can't
 just
 work


for
 one
 of
 the
 audiences
 or
 or
 two
 of


the
 audiences
 it
 really
 has
 to
 work
 for


everyone
 and
 so
 that
 was
 a
 nice


organizing
 framework
 for
 us
 to
 figure


out
 okay
 great
 you
 made
 it
 work
 at


Stanford
 can
 you
 make
 this
 work
 in
 Palo


Alto
 then
 can
 you
 make
 this
 work
 in
 a


larger
 area
 like
 San
 Jose
 um
 you
 know


and
 and
 and
 and
 how
 extensible
 is
 the


service
 right
 can
 you
 repeat
 this
 in


places
 of
 all
 social
 economic


backgrounds
 and
 populations
 and
 so
 that


was
 really
 the
 journey
 I
 would
 argue


between
 2013
 and
 2016
 where
 we
 proved
 to


ourselves
 that
 a
 we
 could
 make
 it
 work


for
 all
 the
 audiences
 and
 make
 a
 dollar


doing
 it
 and
 B
 that
 we
 can
 actually


launch
 this
 in
 a
 mainstream


way
 and
 what
 were
 the
 set
 what
 were
 the


main
 setbacks
 oh
 there
 are
 many
 um
 so


did
 you
 like
 nearly
 die
 during
 this


period
 sometimes
 many
 times
 I
 mean


between
 2013
 and
 2018
 you
 know
 the


company
 almost
 always
 felt
 broke
 and
 you


know
 I
 was
 singularly
 responsible
 for
 it


because
 as
 CEO
 one
 of
 my
 key
 or
 maybe


sole
 job
 responsibilities
 top
 priorities


is
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 never
 run
 out
 of
 cash


but
 it
 was
 really
 hard
 the
 fundraising


process
 you
 know
 I
 remember
 there
 were


three
 years
 between
 2016
 and
 2018
 you


know
 it's
 about
 a
 thousand
 days
 where
 I


felt
 like
 I
 was
 wandering
 in
 the
 desert


asking
 for
 money
 from
 investors
 um
 uh


you
 know
 for
 people
 to
 to
 fund
 door
 Dash


and
 it
 was
 it
 was
 so
 so
 what
 kept
 you


going


on
 there's
 never
 one
 answer
 you
 know
 I
 I


think
 because
 you
 know
 at
 some
 point
 you


know
 willpower
 gives
 out
 right
 and
 and


you
 need
 something
 beyond
 that
 and
 for


us
 you
 know
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 lessons
 I


learned
 you
 know
 through
 throughout
 that


journey
 and
 and
 and
 even
 in
 some
 of
 the


tough
 moments
 early
 on
 in
 the
 company's


life
 is
 that


while
 you
 have
 this
 Grand
 Vision
 and


Mission
 as
 the
 entrepreneur
 that
 you're


always
 holding
 on
 to
 it's
 really
 the


team
 that
 dictates
 your
 day-to-day


satisfaction
 and
 if
 you
 can
 build
 a


culture
 where
 it
 feels
 like
 yes
 you
 want


to
 win
 and
 yes
 you
 want
 to
 do
 all
 the


things
 for
 the


customer
 and
 it
 feels
 like
 you're


playing
 for
 one
 another
 and
 playing
 you


know
 for
 the
 team
 versus
 just
 playing


for
 yourself


um
 it's
 a
 lot
 easier
 to
 get
 through


whatever
 the
 moments
 are
 because
 it's
 a


lot
 easier
 to
 have
 you
 know
 at
 the
 time


there's
 about
 250
 of
 us
 you
 know
 go


through
 this
 together
 versus
 just
 me


singlehandedly
 trying
 to
 do
 this
 on
 my


own
 and
 look
 I
 mean
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 that


there
 weren't
 losses
 right
 we
 you
 know


we
 had
 a
 quarter
 of
 the
 team
 you
 know


maybe
 a
 little
 less
 but
 close
 to
 a


quarter
 of
 the
 team
 who
 decided
 that


maybe
 there
 were
 greener
 pastures


elsewhere
 because
 you
 know
 you
 see
 the


bank
 account
 declining
 every
 single
 week


where
 highly
 transparent
 High
 ownership


company
 where
 we
 report
 out
 on
 numbers


and
 and
 and
 I
 understand
 that
 and
 and


but
 but
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 people


that
 remain
 and
 and
 stuck
 with
 it
 and


perhaps
 this
 is
 you
 know
 one
 version
 of


survivorship
 bias
 but
 for
 the
 people


that
 remained
 that
 you
 know
 hung
 in


there
 long
 enough
 and
 won
 by
 building
 a


product
 because
 we
 didn't
 have
 any


access
 to
 Dollar
 so
 there
 was
 no


marketing
 spend
 or
 things
 like
 this
 that


had
 a
 product
 that
 had
 higher
 retention


and
 Order
 frequency


so
 that
 we
 can
 then
 get
 lucky
 enough
 to


get
 an
 investor
 or
 two
 to
 say
 Yes
 um


that
 you
 know
 that
 group
 of
 people
 um
 I


think
 share
 a
 bond
 that
 is
 very
 very


very
 difficult
 impossible
 to
 break
 now


you
 started
 with
 food
 and
 then
 you


broaden
 out
 you
 now
 do
 groceries
 you
 do


uh
 you
 know
 other
 things
 too
 what
 what


are
 you
 um
 what's
 what's
 the
 um


limitations
 here
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 you


can


deliver
 well
 if
 you
 can
 deliver
 ice


cream
 cold
 or
 pizza
 a
 hot
 you
 basically


can
 deliver
 anything
 and
 so
 that
 was
 you


know
 part
 of
 the
 thesis
 of
 again


starting
 with
 prepared
 meals
 not
 just


because
 of
 the
 order
 density
 perspective


but
 also
 from
 what
 you're
 talking
 about


which
 is
 the
 logistics
 capability
 so
 you


know
 we've
 effectively
 built
 the
 most


sophisticated
 Point
 too
 system
 um
 where


you
 know
 any
 business
 can
 deliver
 to
 any


consumer
 and
 back
 any
 business
 can


deliver
 to
 any
 other
 business
 and
 and


look
 there's
 a
 long
 ways
 to
 go
 you
 know


I
 I
 think
 there's
 the
 logistics
 element


to
 how
 hard
 this
 is
 as
 you
 go
 from
 you


know
 category
 a
 to
 category
 B
 to
 you


know
 other
 categories
 but
 there's
 also


just
 organizing
 the
 information
 that's


offline
 you
 know
 none
 of
 this


information
 exists
 if
 you
 we're
 sitting


today
 in
 Los
 Angeles
 if
 we
 wanted
 to
 ask


where's
 the
 last
 parking
 space
 in


Downtown
 LA
 that's
 a
 really
 important


question
 for
 Dashers
 who
 want
 to
 be


doing
 deliveries
 or
 if
 we
 wanted
 to
 ask


you
 know
 where
 can
 we
 find
 the
 last
 you


know
 bottle
 of
 coke
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 at
 a


particular
 price
 point
 very
 few
 stores


know
 that
 information
 right
 and
 and
 I


think
 while
 there's
 an
 amazing


Revolution
 happening
 certainly
 with


large
 language
 models
 online
 today


there's
 still
 so
 much
 information
 that


is
 Offline
 that
 still
 needs
 to
 be


organized
 and


assembled
 you
 talked
 previously
 about
 um


you
 know
 Wars
 you
 say
 there
 were
 two


Wars
 there
 is
 a
 war
 on
 on
 bits
 and
 there


is
 a
 war
 on
 atoms
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do


you
 mean
 by
 that
 I
 think
 if
 you
 think


about
 what's
 happening
 in


technology
 um
 today
 and
 and
 this
 is
 I


think
 even
 true
 Beyond
 technology
 you


know
 we
 have
 you
 know
 one
 world
 where


it's
 a
 digital
 first
 or
 possibly
 digital


only
 world
 where
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of


dynamic
 behavior
 in
 the
 environment


thanks
 to
 llms
 but
 also
 just
 thanks
 to
 a


lot
 of
 people
 vying
 for
 the
 consumer's


attention
 right
 who
 ultimately
 want
 to


be
 that
 Center
 Point
 that
 digital


assistant
 for
 your
 life
 right
 and
 and


and
 there's
 a
 big
 battle
 going
 on
 right


now
 but
 there's
 also
 another
 you
 know


War
 um
 where
 we're
 talking
 about


physical
 atoms
 where
 you
 know
 people


like
 ourselves
 are
 trying
 to
 organize


all
 of
 the
 offline
 information
 and
 we're


also
 trying
 to
 deliver
 you
 know
 all
 of


you
 know
 the
 products
 and
 help
 local


businesses
 grow
 incrementally
 as
 well
 as


build
 their
 own
 capabilities
 for
 their


first-party
 channels


and
 I
 think
 that
 you
 know
 what's


interesting
 you
 know
 is
 that
 there's


lots
 of
 activity
 happening
 in
 both
 of


these
 Arenas
 and
 I
 also
 think
 there's


going
 to
 be
 over
 time
 intersection


between
 the
 Arenas
 but
 I
 think
 right
 now


there's
 so
 much
 interesting
 activity
 you


know
 just
 just
 happening
 in
 developments


you
 know
 that
 literally
 are
 progressing


by
 the
 day
 and
 by
 the
 hour
 in
 both


worlds
 now
 you
 were
 expanded
 outside
 the


US
 as
 well
 um
 well
 you
 expanded
 to


Scandinavia
 you
 B
 Vault
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah


door
 Das
 is
 now
 live


in
 you
 know
 about
 30
 countries
 worldwide


29
 outside
 of
 the
 US
 and
 you're
 totally


right
 um
 we
 teamed
 up
 with
 an
 awesome


company
 called
 volt
 um
 who
 is


headquartered
 in
 Helsinki
 so
 the
 Nordic


um
 uh
 and
 um
 they
 you
 know
 they
 actually


Mickey
 um
 kusy
 who's
 the
 founder
 and
 CEO


of
 volt
 actually
 leads
 all
 of
 D
 das's


International
 efforts
 so
 how
 many


different
 experiments
 are
 you
 running


well
 we
 run
 a
 lot
 of
 experiments
 and
 and


um
 but
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 mean
 that


you
 know
 that's
 a
 reflection
 of
 how
 many


different
 uh
 uh
 you
 know
 projects
 we


have
 so
 door
 Dash
 has
 always
 been
 a


company
 where
 the
 bias
 for
 Action
 is
 the


way
 we
 solve
 and
 settle
 debates
 we
 don't


analyze
 a
 lot
 um
 or
 debate
 a
 lot
 we
 tend


to
 ship
 um
 lots
 of
 experiments
 you
 know


hundreds
 to
 thousands
 of
 experiments
 per


week
 recognizing
 that
 most
 of
 them
 will


not
 make
 it
 to
 our
 audiences
 most
 of


them
 will
 not
 make
 it
 to
 customers


consumers
 merchants
 or
 Dashers
 on
 the


one
 hand
 you
 can
 argue
 that
 feel
 feels


really
 unfortunate
 and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


just
 productive
 energy
 going
 away
 but


the
 way
 we
 think
 about
 it
 is
 it's
 about


how
 fast
 we
 can
 learn
 and
 how
 fast
 we


can
 fix
 things
 um
 and
 if
 we
 can
 do
 that


um
 well
 then
 then
 then
 then
 hopefully


we've
 earned
 you
 know
 another
 rung
 in


the
 ladder
 of
 satisfying
 a
 consumer
 one


thing
 we've
 learned
 so
 so
 hope
 FSE
 can


you
 trial
 and
 fail
 and
 move
 on
 well
 I


mean
 I
 think
 with
 experiments
 that
 can


probably
 happen
 in
 hours
 but
 but
 but


building
 businesses
 you
 you
 need
 more


than
 one
 type
 of
 skill
 one
 type
 of
 skill


we're
 talking
 about
 here
 is
 this


learning
 agility
 and
 speed
 of
 execution


and
 the
 willingness
 to
 try
 and


fail
 but
 there
 also
 you
 know
 is
 I
 I


would
 say
 you
 know
 another
 side
 of


business
 building
 which
 is
 really
 hard


sometimes
 to
 keep
 you
 know
 um
 uh
 in


conjunction
 you
 know
 with
 this


willingness
 to
 learn
 which
 is
 the


ability
 um
 to
 have
 the
 patience
 and
 the


long-term
 conviction
 um
 that
 you
 know


perhaps
 the
 um
 path
 that
 we're
 traveling


on
 is
 the
 wrong
 one
 but
 at
 least
 where


we're
 going
 is
 the
 right
 place
 and
 and
 I


think
 you
 know
 as
 as
 the
 operator
 in


some
 ways
 you
 need
 two
 Management


Systems
 you
 know
 one
 that's
 used
 to


manage
 something
 where
 you
 have
 a
 pretty


good
 idea
 of
 where
 you're
 going
 and
 and


you
 can
 even
 forecast
 with
 great


accuracy
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 the
 variance


along
 the
 paths
 these
 might
 be
 some
 of


your
 more
 scaled
 businesses
 or


businesses
 in
 which
 you've
 you
 know


surpassed
 product
 Market
 fit
 and
 finding


efficient
 ways
 to


grow
 that
 requires
 a
 very
 different
 set


of
 management
 te
 techniques
 than
 you


know
 inventing
 new
 businesses
 um
 where


you
 want
 to
 be
 stubborn
 about
 you
 know


the
 the
 the
 the
 vision
 of
 where
 you
 want


to
 go
 and
 what
 the
 job
 to
 be
 done
 for


the
 customer
 is
 but
 you
 have
 to
 be
 super


creative
 patient
 and
 open-minded
 about


the
 past
 in
 which
 you're
 going
 to
 get


there
 and
 I
 think
 you
 know
 that's
 been


true
 in
 door
 das's
 life
 in
 each
 one
 of


the
 businesses
 we
 have
 about
 five


businesses
 now
 that
 we
 we
 operate
 but
 as


we
 think
 about
 inventing
 business
 numb
 6


7
 8
 9
 etc
 etc
 etc
 you
 know
 we
 have
 to


keep
 an
 open
 mind
 to
 have
 two
 different


systems
 in
 which
 we
 operate
 so
 now
 I


work
 for
 you
 and
 you
 say
 hey
 Nikolai
 um


could
 you
 go
 and
 check
 out
 this
 thing
 I


do
 this
 experiment
 it's
 a
 failure
 I
 come


back
 to
 you
 and
 say
 t
 Tony
 I'm
 really


sorry
 I've
 you
 know
 screwed
 it
 up
 there


how
 do
 you
 react
 I
 would
 ask
 what
 is
 did


you
 learn
 and
 you
 know
 I
 think
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 is
 you
 know
 so
 important


to
 contextualize
 as
 the
 entrepreneur
 um


on
 a
 New
 Journey
 is
 that
 there's
 always


elements
 of
 skill
 and
 elements
 of
 luck


and
 you
 need
 both
 as
 the
 entrepreneur


you
 know
 I
 think
 that
 when
 we
 were


founding
 door
 Dash
 we
 made
 some
 good


decisions
 about
 what
 to
 prioritize
 how


much
 to
 bet
 on
 certain
 dimensions
 of
 how


a
 consumer
 will
 judge
 us
 versus
 a


merchant
 versus
 a
 a
 Dasher
 and
 there's


some
 points
 you
 know
 that
 we
 scored
 from


the
 skill
 category
 but
 there
 was
 a
 lot


of
 luck
 around
 how
 large
 these


categories
 could
 be
 or
 that
 if
 we
 made


certain
 decisions
 to
 you
 know
 invest


more
 in
 this
 market
 versus
 that
 market


um
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 not
 always


something
 that
 you
 get
 to
 know
 in


advance
 otherwise
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 an


entrepreneurial
 Journey
 moving
 tank
 a


bit
 here
 um
 Ai
 and
 Technology
 what's
 the


next
 thing
 it
 can
 do
 for
 the
 company
 I


think
 right
 now
 the
 answer
 is
 we
 don't


know
 and
 we're
 trying
 our
 best
 to
 learn


as
 fast
 as
 possible
 so
 we
 certainly
 have


been
 playing
 um
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 the


advancements
 in
 large
 language
 models


you
 know
 pretty
 much
 for
 the
 last
 you


know
 two
 or
 three
 years
 and
 certainly


it's
 become
 even
 more
 popularized
 over


that
 period
 of
 time
 and
 we've
 seen


glimpses
 of
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 um
 success
 um


especially
 as
 we
 think
 about
 how
 can
 we


help
 organize
 the
 physical
 world
 um
 and


build
 data
 sets
 from
 that
 and
 use
 AI
 to


understand
 how
 to
 fill
 out
 those


cataloges
 um
 we've
 seen
 AI
 in
 in
 in
 in


other
 use
 cases
 whether
 it's
 you
 know


helping
 us
 with
 customer
 support
 or


detecting
 fraud
 um
 there's
 lots
 of
 you


know
 use
 cases
 and
 I
 think
 you
 know
 the


best
 way
 to
 kind
 of
 think
 about
 where
 we


are
 is
 just
 we're
 very
 small
 percentage


of
 the
 progress
 bar
 it's
 one
 we're
 very


bullish
 on
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 general


technology
 but
 you
 know
 in
 terms
 of
 you


know
 Finding
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 Home


Run
 I
 guess
 that
 the
 Mantra
 we
 have


right
 now
 is
 about
 making
 sure
 that
 it's


about
 having
 enough
 shots
 on
 goal
 where


we
 don't
 know
 the
 Silver
 Bullet
 you
 know


answer
 to
 your
 question
 about
 what
 is


the
 you
 know
 know
 killer
 application


with
 respect
 to
 some
 of
 the
 advances
 in


llms
 as
 it
 applies
 to
 our
 kind
 of


business
 um
 but
 we're
 learning
 quickly


who
 else
 is
 trying
 to
 organize
 the


physical
 world
 the
 way
 you
 are
 well
 I


think
 it's
 happening
 in
 Pockets
 you
 know


I
 think
 what's
 so
 hard
 about
 this
 is


that
 um
 unless
 it's
 your
 mission
 to
 grow


and
 to
 empower
 local
 economies
 where
 you


know
 you're
 on
 this
 many
 multi-decade


Journey
 where
 that
 is
 the
 sole
 source
 of


what
 you
 want
 to
 do
 I
 think
 it's
 really


hard
 um
 and
 and
 and
 and
 that's
 why
 I


think
 in
 the


past
 it's
 mostly
 been
 done
 in
 Pockets


right
 you
 know
 some
 people
 will
 organize


I
 don't
 know
 parts
 of
 retail
 other


people
 might
 organize
 you
 know
 parts
 of


services
 other
 people
 might
 organize


parts
 of
 department
 stores
 and
 and
 I


think
 what's
 what's
 um
 you
 know
 both


daunting
 as
 well
 as
 exciting
 for
 us
 at


door
 Das
 is
 just
 the
 enormity
 of
 the


challenge
 that
 you
 know
 we
 see
 ahead
 of


us
 where
 we
 do
 want
 to
 be
 both
 the


infrastructure
 in
 the
 um
 in
 in
 the


physical
 world
 for
 every
 city
 we
 operate


in
 and
 we
 also
 want
 to
 connect
 every


local
 Merchant
 with
 every
 local
 consumer


and
 I
 think
 you
 know
 doing
 these
 things


are
 just
 it's
 only
 two
 things
 but
 it's


going
 to
 take
 many
 decades


at
 the
 same
 time
 you
 try
 to
 kind
 of
 put


yourself
 out
 of


business
 well
 we're
 always
 trying
 to


make
 sure
 that
 we're
 inventing
 a
 better


product
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I've


learned
 is
 that
 consumers
 are
 never


satisfied
 there
 is
 all
 like
 no
 consumer


is
 going
 to
 remember
 the
 fact
 that
 you


know
 we've
 delivered
 faster
 today
 than
 a


year
 ago
 they're
 just
 going
 to
 expect
 us


to
 deliver
 faster
 you
 know
 a
 year
 from


now
 or
 or
 even
 tomorrow
 right
 and
 and
 no


consumer
 is
 going
 to
 ever
 you
 know
 ask


us
 to
 increase
 our
 prices
 or
 lower
 our


selection
 or
 make
 worse
 our
 customer


support
 so
 I
 think
 you
 know


instead
 it's
 I
 I
 think
 building
 the


fortitude
 as
 well
 as
 the
 team
 with
 the


mentality
 that
 um
 we
 always
 have
 to


invent
 new
 businesses
 but
 we
 also
 must


understand
 the
 importance
 that
 we
 always


have
 to
 keep
 getting
 better
 at
 the
 main


thing
 too
 right
 it's
 it's
 like
 you
 have


optimization
 on
 one
 side
 and
 Innovation


on
 the
 other
 and
 they
 require
 very


different
 Management
 Systems
 they
 also


require
 to
 hold
 both
 of
 these
 things
 in


your
 head
 at
 the
 same
 time
 what
 kind
 of


culture
 do
 you
 need
 at
 door
 Dash
 to


achieve
 this
 I
 think
 you
 need
 um
 you


know
 several
 things
 to
 come
 together


because
 I'm
 I'm
 glad
 you
 asked
 about
 um


you
 know
 the
 culture
 that
 that
 might
 be


the
 only
 thing
 that
 actually
 allows
 you


to
 achieve
 you
 know
 um
 you
 know
 all
 of


these
 Ambitions
 and
 build
 all
 of
 the


products
 which
 is
 I
 think
 it's
 first
 and


foremost
 start
 with
 a
 very
 high


ownership
 High
 accountability
 kind
 of


culture
 where
 if
 you
 think
 about
 what
 we


do
 um
 it's
 more
 of
 a
 utility
 service


versus
 an
 entertainment
 system
 right
 so


if
 we
 mess
 up
 and
 we
 don't
 bring
 you


your
 products
 um
 that
 is
 extremely


disappointing
 in
 the
 eyes
 of
 the


consumer
 that's
 a
 lost
 sale
 which
 is
 um


you
 know
 for
 a
 business
 that
 might
 be
 uh


very
 thin
 on
 margins
 and
 it's
 a
 lost


work
 opportunity
 um
 you
 know
 for
 a


driver
 I
 mean
 it
 really
 is
 a
 reflection


of
 the
 local
 economy
 the
 way
 I
 see
 it
 is


if
 you
 think
 about
 GDP
 and
 where
 it
 gets


created
 most
 GDP
 is
 still
 produced
 by


the
 small
 medium
 and
 large
 businesses


physically
 inside
 every
 city
 and
 they


also
 these
 businesses
 describe
 the


personalities
 of
 why
 we
 choose
 to
 live


in
 Los
 Angeles
 or
 Oslo
 or
 San
 Francisco


or
 other
 great
 cities
 and
 I
 think
 in


order
 for
 that
 to
 stay
 vibrant
 and
 true


where
 we
 live
 in
 a
 world
 where
 all
 of


these
 businesses
 will
 be
 successful


instead
 of
 a
 world
 where
 there
 might


just
 be
 success
 at
 the
 hands
 of
 one
 or


two
 you
 know


Merchants


then
 we
 have
 to
 um
 take
 great
 ownership


and
 seriousness
 of
 of
 that


responsibility
 I
 think
 it
 starts
 there


so
 how
 do
 you
 find
 so
 so
 now
 so
 you
 talk


about
 accountability
 and
 and
 and


ownership
 so
 here
 you
 interview
 me
 now


for
 a
 job
 how
 do
 you
 figure
 out
 whether


I
 have


it
 I
 don't
 think
 there
 are
 any
 magical


interview
 questions
 I
 think
 most
 of


these
 things
 you
 know
 know
 happen


through
 listening
 um
 than
 than


necessarily
 asking
 the
 perfect
 interview


question
 I
 recognize
 it's
 a
 bit
 ironic


as
 we're
 talking
 about
 this
 in
 a
 podcast


but
 but
 you
 know
 for
 instance
 I
 I'll


give
 some
 examples
 right
 so
 when
 we
 talk


about
 you
 know
 High
 accountability
 if
 I


see
 a
 senior
 executive
 come
 and
 you
 know


the
 first
 thing
 they
 tell
 me
 um
 in
 the


in
 the
 you
 know
 interview
 is
 here
 are


the
 five
 reasons
 why
 you
 should
 not
 hire


me
 that's
 a
 very
 different
 communication


mechanism
 or
 Choice
 than
 someone
 who


just
 tells
 me
 all
 the
 wonderful
 things


that
 they've
 accomplished
 right
 I
 mean


you
 know
 something
 else
 we
 look
 for
 is


this
 you
 know
 strong
 bias
 for
 action
 one


of
 our
 you
 know
 um
 early
 Builders
 at


door
 Das
 and
 he's
 still
 someone
 who


works
 with
 us
 but
 but
 in
 in
 a
 in
 a


smaller
 capacity
 um
 was
 Christopher


Payne
 um
 you
 know
 who
 who
 was
 our
 chief


was
 our
 first
 Chief
 Operating
 Officer


and
 president
 you
 know
 he
 uh
 I
 remember


spoke
 with
 on
 a
 Friday
 for
 about
 4
 hours


um
 in
 2016
 and
 later
 that
 evening
 like


you
 know
 within
 a
 matter
 of
 a
 couple


hours
 basically
 he
 and
 his
 13-year-old


son
 Andrew
 at
 the
 time
 um
 13
 at
 the
 time


you
 know
 they
 literally
 went
 out
 and


just
 did
 deliveries
 for
 three
 or
 four


hours
 that's
 a
 high
 bias
 for
 Action
 I


didn't
 ask
 him
 to
 do
 that
 I
 didn't
 say


hey
 can
 you
 tell
 me
 what's
 wrong
 with


our
 Logistics
 system
 no
 he
 just
 went
 out


and
 did
 deliveries
 and
 figured
 it
 out


right
 you
 know
 we
 we
 care
 about
 people


who
 operate
 at
 the
 lowest
 level
 of


detail
 because
 the
 physical
 world
 is


messy
 and
 everything
 is
 an
 edge
 case
 so


you
 know
 our
 first
 our
 former
 CFO
 our


current
 president
 prier
 darkart
 prier


shows
 up
 in
 my
 first
 interview
 or


conversation
 where
 he
 brings
 a
 10


megabyte
 file
 that's
 a
 model
 of
 what
 our


financial
 projections
 would
 look
 like


you
 know
 for
 the
 next
 five
 years
 I


didn't
 ask
 this
 was
 a
 this
 was
 a
 coffee


it
 was
 supposed
 to
 be
 a
 coffee
 chat
 what


turned
 out
 you
 know
 to
 be
 a
 4-Hour


examination
 of
 unit
 economics
 and
 you


know
 the
 progression
 of
 you
 know
 our


markets
 and
 our
 performance
 right
 we


look
 for
 people
 who
 can
 hold
 two


opposing
 truths
 at
 the
 same
 time
 right


so
 people
 who
 are
 not
 dogmatic
 in
 how


they
 think
 we
 look
 at
 people
 who
 are


great
 at
 building
 teams
 so
 we
 look
 at


the
 track
 record
 that
 doesn't
 have
 to


come
 from
 an
 interview
 we
 look
 at
 people


who
 have
 strong


followership
 um
 because
 it
 takes
 a
 team


to
 to
 sustain
 in
 order
 to
 win
 and
 so
 we


look
 at
 you
 know
 when
 people
 move
 jobs


for
 example
 you
 know
 so
 even
 before
 the


interview
 we
 look
 at
 when
 they
 move
 jobs


how
 many
 people
 literally
 follow
 them
 MH


and
 you
 know
 so
 these
 are
 some
 of
 the


things
 we
 call
 them
 the
 attributes
 of


Excellence
 that
 we
 look
 for
 in
 building


a
 culture
 that
 I
 think
 you
 know
 can
 meet


the
 demands
 of
 what
 we're
 trying
 to
 do


at
 door
 Dash
 MH
 this
 um
 ability
 to
 get


people
 to
 follow
 you
 or
 being
 a
 talent


magnet
 um
 is
 key
 here
 what
 why
 do
 people


want
 to
 follow
 you
 what
 is
 it
 that
 you


have
 as
 a
 leader
 which
 makes
 it


attractive
 to
 work
 for
 you
 you
 think


well
 I
 think
 you
 should
 ask
 that
 I


already
 would
 love
 to
 work
 for
 you
 so


you
 you
 got
 already
 lined
 up
 I
 think
 you


should
 ask
 them
 Nikolai
 but
 but
 I
 look
 I


I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 always


believe
 and
 I
 believe
 and
 I
 told
 you


this
 at
 the
 onset
 of
 our
 conversation


today
 is
 that
 I
 believe
 that
 everyone


has
 a
 superpower
 and
 it's
 my
 job
 as
 the


leader
 to
 get
 it
 out
 of
 them
 and
 give


them
 the
 maximum
 exposure
 for
 for
 that


superpower
 and
 and
 I
 hope
 that


superpower
 uh
 that
 that
 exposure
 will


always
 be
 at
 door
 Dash
 right
 I
 hope
 that


to
 be
 true
 but
 even
 if
 it's
 not
 true
 and


it
 has
 to
 be
 somewhere
 else
 I
 think
 you


know
 maximizing
 someone's
 strength
 is
 is


is
 really
 really
 important
 and
 and
 so
 I


think
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 people
 have


appreciated
 when
 they
 come
 to
 Door
 Dash


is
 that
 it's
 a
 place
 um
 that
 sets
 a
 high


bar
 you
 know
 for
 for
 achievement
 and
 and


and
 excellence
 and
 I
 think
 you
 know


people
 who
 are
 very
 motivated
 tend
 to
 be


motivated
 similarly
 it's
 a
 place
 that


you
 know
 is


very
 rigorous
 and
 um
 maniacal
 about
 um


the
 the
 the
 the
 outcomes
 but
 but
 but
 we


very
 flexible
 on
 how
 we
 get
 there
 it's
 a


place
 that
 bets
 on
 people
 perhaps
 before


their
 resume
 has
 achieved
 maybe
 The


credibility
 to
 deserve
 or
 warrant
 that


job
 opportunity
 it's
 a
 place
 that
 is


willing
 to
 take
 you
 know
 risks
 um
 um


sometimes
 that's
 time
 risk
 sometimes


that's
 Financial
 Risk
 sometimes
 that's


operating
 risk
 um
 and
 I
 think
 you
 know


all
 of
 this
 sums
 up
 it's
 a
 place
 where


we
 are
 trying
 to
 make
 you
 the
 best


version
 of
 yourself
 and
 and
 hopefully


you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 aspirations
 I
 always


have
 had
 at
 door
 Dash
 is
 it's
 not
 to


just
 make
 you
 successful
 at
 door
 Das


that's
 great
 but
 really
 if
 you
 know
 if


we
 are
 successful
 as
 As
 Leaders
 at
 door


Das
 if
 you
 know
 the
 day
 that
 you
 left


door
 Das
 and
 decided
 to
 do
 whatever
 you


know
 happened
 to
 be
 next
 for
 you
 that


you
 are
 so
 confident
 that
 you
 can


achieve
 you
 know
 that
 scale
 of
 ambition


than
 we've
 done
 our
 job
 what
 is
 your


super


power


sometimes
 I'm
 still
 trying
 to
 figure


that
 out
 but
 but
 I
 think
 one
 of
 um
 the


things
 that
 I
 find
 a
 lot
 of
 joy
 and
 um


spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on
 is
 spending
 time


with
 people
 um
 that
 have
 more


um
 Talent
 than
 they
 do


experience
 and
 identifying
 those
 people


early
 but
 also
 giving
 them
 um
 exposure


in
 the
 right
 ways
 that
 so
 that
 means
 you


don't
 just
 you
 know
 give
 them
 maximum


exposure
 and
 just
 you
 know
 let
 them
 sink


or
 swim
 but
 you
 know
 giving
 them
 the


right
 amount
 of
 support
 um
 while
 pushing


them
 you
 know
 um
 to
 the
 edge
 so
 that


they
 still
 have
 their
 confidence
 so
 that


they
 can
 achieve
 the
 next
 level
 much


faster
 than
 they
 otherwise
 would


have
 you
 are
 on
 the
 board
 of
 U
 meta
 you


know
 um
 Facebook
 basically
 um
 what
 are


you
 learning
 there
 that
 you
 have
 taken


into
 your
 business
 I


think
 sometimes
 um


one
 of
 the
 hardest
 things
 to
 keep
 up
 as


you
 become
 more
 and
 more
 successful
 um


and
 when
 you
 talk
 about
 meta
 you're


talking
 about
 you
 know
 a
 family
 of
 apps


right
 that
 are
 used
 by
 more
 often
 than


you
 know
 any
 other
 products
 in
 the
 world


um
 and
 you're
 talking
 about
 audacious


bets
 in
 AI
 in
 reality
 Labs
 um
 and


building
 you
 know
 the
 next


ecosystem
 I
 think
 to
 see
 that
 constant


Drive


despite
 all
 of
 the
 success
 it
 already


has
 achieved
 is
 astounding
 because
 it


means
 that
 the
 company
 has
 an
 enormous


willingness
 to
 fail
 if
 you
 think
 about


it
 they're
 still
 trying
 to
 invent
 new


things
 whether
 it's
 in
 AI
 or
 in
 the


metaverse
 and
 some
 of
 these
 ecosystems


you
 know
 certainly
 are
 not
 here
 yet
 some


of
 which
 might
 be
 many
 years
 away
 to


have
 the
 willingness
 I
 think
 to
 perhaps


go
 against
 the
 wisdom
 of
 the
 crowd
 um
 to


do
 that
 to
 have
 the
 courage
 of
 their


conviction
 um
 to
 to
 do
 that
 both
 in
 the


new
 as
 well
 as
 the
 existing
 you
 know


that
 the
 family
 of
 apps
 with
 Facebook


Instagram
 WhatsApp
 and
 many
 other


fantastic
 products
 I
 think
 that's
 super


inspiring
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 you
 know
 it's


a
 great
 um
 almost
 like
 look
 forward
 for


for
 for
 me
 and
 and
 and
 and
 I
 think


others
 where
 you
 can
 see
 both
 management


styles
 of
 running
 scaled
 businesses
 and


inventing
 the
 new
 you
 know
 the
 other


thing
 I've
 learned
 is
 just
 um
 how
 great


um
 the
 leadership
 team
 at
 meta
 is
 at


building
 the
 Next
 Generation
 you
 know


meta
 is
 a
 company
 that
 largely
 not
 not


entirely
 but
 largely
 has
 been
 built
 from


within
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 um
 uh
 mentoring


and
 and
 giving
 the
 opportunities
 you


know
 across
 the
 board
 um
 across
 various


products
 and
 I
 think
 you
 know
 that
 that


also
 is
 something
 that
 resonates
 quite
 a


lot
 with
 how
 we
 think
 about
 talent


development
 at
 doores
 how
 do
 you


relax
 I
 uh
 I
 love
 to
 exercise
 so
 I
 um


and
 I
 heard
 you
 do
 have
 Norwegian
 kind


of
 exercise
 regime
 right
 I've
 tried
 I've


tried
 it's
 called
 the
 Norwegian
 4x4


which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 proven


exercises
 scientifically
 to
 increase


your
 V2
 Max
 um
 although
 I
 would
 say
 it's


a
 it's
 a
 difficult
 workout
 and
 I


wouldn't
 recommend
 it
 if
 you've
 never


ran
 before
 that's
 not
 the
 first
 exercise


I'd
 recommend
 for
 you
 um
 but
 you
 know


for
 me
 I
 really
 believe
 in
 routines
 as
 a


way
 to
 find
 balance
 and
 normaly
 or
 or


balance
 may
 not
 be
 the
 right
 word
 but


but
 to
 integrate
 my
 life
 and
 my
 work


right
 and
 so
 for
 me
 right
 now
 and
 and


routines
 can
 change
 you
 know
 your
 life


circumstances
 can
 change
 um
 I
 started


door
 Das
 as
 a
 single
 you
 know
 person
 and


I
 was
 dating
 but
 you
 know
 now
 I'm


married
 with
 two
 kids
 and
 my
 life
 is


very
 different
 from
 you
 know
 10
 11
 years


ago
 right
 and
 and
 so
 now
 my
 routines
 are


you
 know
 continuously
 exercising
 still
 I


still
 exercise
 every
 single
 day
 um
 it


for
 me
 that
 used
 to
 mean
 you
 know


running
 and
 and
 and
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 was


distance
 running
 um
 today
 that's
 shifted


and
 morphed
 into
 other
 types
 of
 sports


whether
 it's
 you
 know
 weight
 training
 or


Jiu-Jitsu
 um
 trying
 a
 new
 types
 of
 sport


Beyond
 just
 running
 what
 do
 you


read
 uh
 I
 try
 my
 best
 to
 keep
 up
 in


Reading
 um
 although
 that's
 been
 a
 bit


light
 recently
 I
 I
 try
 my
 best
 to
 read


you
 know
 books
 um
 every
 month
 I'm
 a
 big


fan
 of
 non-fiction
 so
 I
 you
 read
 history


yeah
 a
 lot
 of
 history
 but
 but
 a
 lot
 of


it
 is
 different
 from
 my
 wife
 who
 who
 is


a
 an
 exclusive
 reader
 fiction
 so
 we
 we


we
 don't
 really
 have
 overlapping


necessarily
 reading
 interests
 but
 and


what
 kind
 of
 History
 do
 you
 read
 what


you
 find
 useful
 a
 lot
 you
 know
 one
 of


the
 things
 I
 like
 to
 I
 love
 to
 read


about
 real
 people
 you
 know
 I
 think
 one


of
 the
 things
 is
 I
 truly
 believe
 that


life
 is
 more
 interesting
 and


entertaining
 sometimes
 Than
 Fiction
 I
 I


think
 some
 of
 these
 things
 you
 just


cannot
 invent
 and
 U
 well
 some
 tell
 me


some
 of
 the
 real
 people
 you've
 you


admire
 have
 read
 well
 there's
 a
 lot
 you


know
 and
 so
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 want
 to


necessarily
 single
 out
 any
 any


particular
 um
 you
 know
 leader
 but
 I've


really
 enjoyed
 you
 know
 histories
 and


you
 know
 biographies
 around
 you
 know


military
 leaders
 um
 or
 different
 Wars


that
 have
 you
 you
 know
 um
 been
 been


started
 or
 the
 study
 of
 Industries
 or


the
 study
 of
 businesses
 um
 that
 that


that
 more
 is
 not
 necessarily
 a
 business


school
 you
 know
 per
 se
 textbook
 but
 more


a
 a
 a
 book
 actually
 about
 the
 business


and
 the
 people
 that
 you
 know
 at
 the


beginnings
 of
 that
 company
 and
 and
 you


know
 trying
 their
 best
 to
 to
 not
 not
 you


know
 tell
 the
 story
 backwards
 but
 but


but
 really
 to
 tell
 the
 story
 from
 the


perspective
 of
 when
 things
 were


happening
 and
 and
 I
 think
 it
 just
 goes


to
 show
 you
 how
 incredible
 humanity
 is


and
 when
 when
 are
 you
 going
 to
 write
 the


story
 about


does
 uh
 probably
 not
 anytime
 soon
 but
 um


but
 you
 look
 our
 our
 story
 is
 still


evolving
 we're
 a
 10-year-old
 company
 and


so
 I
 can't
 believe
 it
 on
 one
 hand
 that


it's
 been
 10
 years
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 I


still
 remember
 the
 apartment
 in
 which


you
 know
 my
 co-founders
 and
 I
 built
 the


company
 out
 of
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to


young
 people


how
 young
 are
 we
 talking
 we
 are
 talking


20
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 would
 say


is
 to
 be
 proud
 of
 the
 person
 in
 the


mirror
 I
 think
 that
 sometimes
 young


people
 um
 get
 thrown
 lots
 of
 advice
 you


know
 from
 their
 parents
 from
 their


friends
 from
 social
 media
 from
 the
 news


and
 it's
 really
 easy
 to
 get
 lost
 in
 the


wind
 I
 I
 was
 almost
 that
 way
 would
 are


the
 thing
 that
 make
 you
 you
 know
 who
 you


are
 what
 is
 your
 superpower
 what
 are
 the


routines
 that
 describe
 you
 such
 that
 you


feel
 like
 work
 is
 not
 work
 that
 you


would
 do
 you
 know
 this
 for
 free
 or
 that


the
 type
 of
 people
 you
 enjoy
 spending


time
 with
 the
 people
 that
 give
 you


energy
 the
 people
 that
 replenish
 you
 and


look
 it
 doesn't
 get
 figured
 out


overnight
 I'm
 still
 trying
 my
 best
 to


figure
 this
 out
 but
 I
 think
 sometimes


the
 world's
 advice
 isn't
 about
 being


proud
 of
 the
 person
 in
 the
 mirror
 it's


about
 chasing
 you
 know
 some
 Shadow
 or


finding
 the
 ne
 next
 exciting
 thing
 to
 be


excited
 about
 and
 I
 get
 that
 topically


like
 I'm
 super
 curious
 about
 lots
 of


different
 things


intellectually
 but
 I
 think
 you
 know
 the


ways
 to
 build
 strategy
 whether
 it's
 for


your
 life
 or
 for
 your
 work
 is
 you
 kind


of
 have
 to
 bet
 on
 the
 things
 that
 don't


change
 and
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 things
 you


have
 to
 bet
 on
 is
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 are


the
 things
 that
 you're
 you
 know
 truly


you
 know
 that
 that
 were
 really
 gifts


given
 to
 you
 um
 that
 naturally
 make
 you


you
 know
 really
 excel
 at
 something
 and
 I


think
 if
 you
 can
 do
 that
 and
 figure
 that


out
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 it
 means
 for
 your


personal
 life
 I
 think
 you're
 going
 to


live
 a
 very
 satisfied
 life
 well
 Tony
 you


should
 be
 really
 proud
 of
 the
 person
 in


the
 mirror
 and
 uh
 this
 has
 been
 a
 real


well
 conversation
 for
 me
 likewise
 thanks


Nikolai
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 all
 right


thank
 you
 appreciate


it
