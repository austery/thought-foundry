Language
 models
 at
 the
 time
 was
 like
 all


the
 hype,
 crazy
 optimism
 about
 language


models.
 We
 felt
 similarly
 about
 image


models.
 Yes,
 this
 is
 a
 niche
 place.


Where
 could
 this
 be
 going?


>> Finding
 a
 niche
 market
 that
 is
 fast


growing
 is
 the
 key
 to
 startup
 success.


After
 these
 big
 models
 were
 released
 is


that
 the
 number
 of
 users
 10x,
 100x,


maybe
 over
 a
 millionx,
 we
 we
 saw
 this


this
 change
 early
 on.
 We
 have
 to
 build


systems
 that
 are
 ready
 for
 this
 change.


>> We're
 fast
 at
 everything
 we
 do.
 We
 put


the
 models,
 usually
 we
 have
 day
 zero


releases.
 Space
 is
 moving
 so
 fast.
 We


have
 to
 be
 like
 very
 ahead
 of
 getting


these
 models
 in
 front
 of
 people,
 making


it
 easy
 to
 uh
 use.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


startups
 out
 there,
 you
 know,
 they
 will


be
 stuck
 on
 an
 idea
 for
 like
 months
 and


years,
 right?
 With
 no
 traction.
 You
 have


to
 really
 take
 that
 to
 the
 extreme.
 Like


I
 don't
 think
 people
 stress
 that
 enough.


Think
 of
 moving
 fast.
 take
 that
 and


multiply
 with
 like
 100
 and
 move
 that


fast.


>> If
 we
 are
 wrong,
 we
 can
 always
 revisit


our
 decision.
 Focusing
 on
 image
 and


video
 is
 going
 to
 be
 an
 important


differentiator.
 We
 just
 raised
 our


series
 C
 round
 125
 million
 which
 values


us
 at
 a
 1.5
 billion
 valuation.
 We're


very
 prepared,
 you
 know,
 we're
 prepared


to
 scale.
 Chat
 GPT
 moment
 for
 video
 is


that
 I
 don't
 think
 we've
 hit
 it
 yet.


Right
 now,
 we
 we
 employed,
 you
 know,


language
 models
 at
 massive
 scale.
 We're


going
 to
 have
 to
 do
 that
 for
 AI
 video,


AI
 image,
 AI
 audio,
 even
 AI
 games.
 And


we
 want
 to
 be
 the
 place
 where
 like
 all


the
 builders
 that
 are
 building
 with
 this


technology,
 we
 want
 them
 to
 do
 that


through
 FA.


So
 my
 name
 is
 Burkai
 and
 I'm
 co-founder


and
 CEO
 at
 FAL.
 FAL
 is
 a
 generative


media
 platform
 for
 developers.
 We
 host


models
 that
 can
 generate
 images,
 videos,


3D
 audio.
 Typically
 these
 models
 are


very
 hard
 to
 host.
 So
 the
 problem
 we


solve
 is
 like
 hosting
 these
 models
 as


APIs
 which
 makes
 it
 very
 easy
 to
 consume


for
 developers.
 We
 also
 have
 a
 inference


engine
 that
 we
 built
 inhouse
 that
 is


specifically
 optimized
 to
 run
 diffusion


models
 to
 run
 two
 three
 times
 better.
 I


think
 latency
 kills
 creativity,
 latency


kills
 productivity.
 We
 work
 with


customers
 like
 Adobe,
 Canva,
 Shopify,


Perplexity.
 We
 are
 at
 uh
 90
 million


annualized
 run
 rate
 revenue.


My
 co-founder
 and
 I
 have
 been
 long-term


friends.
 We've
 actually
 we're
 both
 from


Turkey.
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 Turkey.
 I
 moved
 to


the
 States
 for
 college.
 There
 was


definitely
 like
 culture
 shock.
 I
 think


like
 even
 a
 decade
 makes
 a
 big


difference
 here,
 right?
 Like
 I
 moved
 to


the
 States
 2007.
 I
 think
 Facebook
 had


just
 come
 out.
 It
 definitely
 felt
 like
 I


wasn't
 as
 tapped
 in
 to
 like
 the
 culture,


right?
 So
 there's
 like
 a
 big
 gap
 between


how
 I
 how
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 Turkey
 and
 like


what
 people
 like
 to
 do
 there
 versus
 like


how
 they're
 in
 the
 US.


>> I
 would
 say
 like
 school
 work
 felt
 a


little
 bit
 easier
 than
 than
 I
 thought


because
 we
 have
 a
 pretty
 good
 education


system
 in
 high
 school
 in
 Turkey


especially
 with
 maths
 and
 sciences.
 the


the
 the
 biggest
 challenge
 actually
 was


like
 the
 understanding
 the
 job
 market,


how
 people
 do
 internships
 because


immediately
 people
 start
 school
 and


prepare
 for
 their
 summer
 internship
 and


then
 the
 next
 summer
 and
 like
 they
 have


a
 whole
 plan
 on
 how
 their
 career
 is


going
 to
 happen.
 I
 didn't
 know
 I
 should


be
 doing
 that.
 So
 couple
 years
 I
 wasn't


really
 planning
 my
 internships
 towards


my
 career.
 So
 that
 was
 a
 big
 big
 shock.


>> I
 actually
 did
 an
 internship
 at
 Oracle


like
 during
 college.
 I
 was
 working
 on


some
 like
 fairly
 boring
 things
 in
 the


beginning
 to
 be
 honest
 and
 I
 had
 started


my
 green
 card
 process.
 This
 is
 like
 a


very
 typical
 thing
 for
 immigrants
 in
 the


US.
 You
 could
 kind
 of
 like
 be
 stuck
 in


jobs
 if
 you
 start
 your
 green
 card


process.
 Around
 2015
 was
 a
 very


interesting
 time.
 Deep
 learning
 was
 just


like
 kind
 of
 starting
 to
 become
 popular.


I
 started
 getting
 really
 into
 it.
 Around


that
 time
 I
 had
 a
 few
 other
 friends
 at


Coinbase
 and
 Coinbase
 was
 a
 very
 small


company
 back
 then.
 It's
 like
 maybe
 40
 50


people.
 One
 of
 my
 friends
 told
 me
 like,


"Hey,
 we're
 building
 a
 machine
 learning


team."
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 this


sounds
 very
 interesting.
 Like
 I
 can
 go


like
 do
 some
 deep
 learning
 in
 this
 new


company
 and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things


things
 I
 can
 learn
 there."
 But
 I
 was


mainly
 excited
 about
 like
 starting
 my


own
 thing.
 I
 had
 actually
 talked
 to
 a


lot
 of
 my
 founder
 friends
 seeing
 their


experience.
 I
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 encouragement


from
 friends
 to
 actually
 go
 and
 start
 my


own
 thing.


>> In
 the
 beginning
 of
 co
 Burka
 and
 I
 rent


a
 house
 in
 Palm
 Springs
 for
 a
 while.
 We


were
 talking
 about
 potentially
 starting


a
 company
 but
 we
 didn't
 have
 particular


angle
 or
 idea
 to
 go
 after.
 So
 we
 knew


that
 we
 want
 to
 do
 this
 we
 would
 have
 to


go
 through
 period
 of
 exploration
 where


we
 find
 something
 that
 we
 are
 both


passionate
 about.
 Purai
 quit
 maybe
 4


months
 before
 me
 and
 then
 I
 joined
 them.


It
 is
 liberating
 because
 all
 my
 life
 I


also
 had
 to
 deal
 with
 immigration
 work


visa
 and
 then
 green
 card.
 That's
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 actually
 I
 stayed
 at
 working


at
 a
 big
 company.
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 that's


the
 only
 reason
 but
 that's
 definitely
 a


factor.
 And
 at
 that
 time
 all
 my


immigration
 process
 had
 ended
 as
 well.


That
 was
 also
 liberating
 in
 the
 sense


that
 I
 didn't
 have
 to
 work
 for
 a
 big


tech
 company
 to
 stay
 in
 the
 country.
 I


could
 do
 whatever
 I
 want
 and
 I
 took
 the


opportunity
 then.


>> Starting
 with
 the
 posthatit
 era
 it
 was


brand
 new
 to
 everybody.
 It
 was
 such
 a


new
 environment
 that
 like
 nobody
 knew


where
 things
 are
 going.
 We
 started


running
 image
 workloads
 and
 we
 saw
 a


tremendous
 growth
 in
 the
 companies
 that


are
 working
 with
 us.
 That
 made
 us
 really


excited
 about
 the
 space.
 We
 also
 sat


down
 and
 thought
 like
 where
 could
 this


be
 going?
 2
 and
 a
 half
 years
 ago
 people


saw
 LLMs
 and
 and
 Chhatra
 PT
 and
 and
 they


sort
 of
 like
 drew
 out
 where
 this


technology
 go
 and
 you
 know
 they


immediately
 said
 okay
 you
 know
 we're


going
 to
 AGI.
 We
 felt
 similarly
 about


image
 models.
 We
 thought
 like
 as
 the


models
 get
 better,
 there's
 going
 to
 be


more
 capabilities.
 Quality
 is
 going
 to


increase
 and
 the
 resolutions
 are
 going


to
 increase
 and
 the
 controllability
 is


going
 to
 increase.


>> I
 think
 finding
 a
 niche
 market
 that
 is


fast
 growing
 is
 the
 key
 to
 startup


success.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 niche


markets
 that
 stay
 niche
 and
 never
 grow.


But
 we
 were
 lucky
 that
 market
 we


operated
 in
 was
 very
 niche
 and
 small
 but


also
 was
 growing
 incredibly
 fast.
 What


changed
 after
 these
 big
 models
 were


released
 is
 that
 you
 didn't
 have
 to


train
 it
 anymore.
 You
 can
 just
 pick
 it


off
 the
 shelf
 and
 start
 building


something
 useful.
 And
 that
 meant
 the


number
 of
 users
 maybe
 10xed,
 100xed,


maybe
 over
 a
 millionx.
 We
 saw
 this
 this


change
 early
 on
 and
 we
 decided,
 okay,


this
 changes
 everything.
 Now
 that
 these


models
 are
 going
 to
 be
 used
 by
 millions


of
 people,
 we
 have
 to
 build
 systems
 that


are
 ready
 for
 this
 change.
 And
 that's


why
 we
 decided
 to
 build
 an
 inference


platform
 early
 on.
 Another
 decision
 we


had
 to
 make
 when
 the
 revenue
 was


constant
 for
 a
 couple
 of
 months.
 One


tempting
 thing
 we
 could
 have
 done
 run


inference
 for
 LLM
 models
 as
 well.


Focusing
 on
 imu
 and
 video
 is
 going
 to
 be


an
 important
 differentiator.
 We
 already


have
 a
 technical
 advantage
 because
 we've


been
 working
 on
 on
 this
 type
 of
 models


for
 a
 while.
 If
 we
 are
 wrong,
 we
 can


always
 revisit
 our
 decision,
 but
 it's


going
 to
 be
 harder
 for
 us
 to
 go
 from


general
 to
 specific.
 So
 we
 tried
 to
 stay


specific.
 I
 I
 think
 if
 you
 focus
 on
 a


specific
 market,
 you
 get
 to
 work
 with


your
 users
 in
 a
 closer
 manner.
 You


understand
 their
 problems
 better.
 For


us,
 this
 was
 image
 models
 and


fine-tuning
 image
 models.
 In
 the


beginning,
 all
 of
 our
 customers
 were


doing
 very
 very
 similar
 things.
 So
 we


were
 able
 to
 focus
 on
 it,
 get
 really


good
 at
 it
 and
 differentiate
 ourselves


from
 others.
 So
 our
 ultimate
 vision
 is


basically
 we
 want
 to
 be
 the


infrastructure
 layer
 for
 this
 new


technology.
 Chat
 GPT
 moment
 for
 video
 is


that
 I
 don't
 think
 we've
 hit
 it
 yet.
 I


think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 signs
 like
 we're


getting
 very
 close
 to
 it.
 Like
 if
 you've


seen
 V3
 it's
 close
 to
 the
 chat
 moment.


It's
 a
 very
 capable
 model
 but
 I
 think
 I


think
 we're
 still
 not
 there
 yet.
 But


interestingly
 like
 you
 know
 now
 if
 you


go
 to
 your
 Instagram
 Tik
 Tok
 feed
 like


third
 half
 the
 the
 videos
 are
 AI


generated
 right?
 it
 is
 already
 happening


in
 a
 way.
 It's
 just
 happening
 in
 like
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 slow
 motion.
 There
 may


be
 a
 point
 this
 year
 is
 that
 we
 see
 like


even
 better
 models
 that
 can
 actually


like
 be
 edited
 uh
 real
 time
 and
 you
 can


interact
 with
 the
 characters
 that
 are
 in


the
 video
 and
 and
 you
 know
 generate
 very


very
 interesting
 content.
 And
 we
 want
 to


be
 the
 place
 where
 like
 all
 of
 this


infrastructure
 is
 being
 hosted
 and
 all


the
 builders
 that
 are
 building
 with
 this


technology
 we
 want
 them
 to
 do
 that


through
 fall.


I
 think
 there
 are
 two
 things
 happening


with
 AI.
 People
 are
 willing
 to
 pay
 but


there
 are
 questions
 about
 the
 quality
 of


that
 revenue
 or
 how
 durable
 that
 revenue


is
 going
 to
 be.
 I
 think
 AI
 markets
 are


are
 incredible
 markets.
 Generative
 media


is
 is
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where
 that
 it


can
 be
 monetized
 right
 away.
 In
 the


previous
 versions
 of
 internet


businesses,
 people
 waited
 years
 and


years
 to
 monetize
 their
 their
 business.


First
 built
 a
 user
 base
 and
 then
 maybe


try
 to
 monetize
 with
 subscription
 or


ads.
 But
 with
 AI,
 people
 are
 willing
 to


pay
 for
 it
 right
 away.
 The
 MVP
 you
 are


building
 should
 be
 good
 enough
 for


people
 to
 start
 paying.
 And
 it
 is
 really


easy
 to
 get
 signs.
 the
 revenue
 numbers


are
 increasing
 or
 not.
 Now
 monetization


should
 be
 something
 a
 priority
 from
 day


zero
 and
 it's
 actually
 easier
 for
 the


founder
 to
 see
 if
 this
 is
 a
 good
 idea
 or


if
 this
 is
 a
 good
 product
 by
 the
 revenue


they
 are
 making
 from
 from
 the
 first
 day.


Um
 we
 are
 very
 particular
 about
 what


models
 we
 want
 to
 put
 because
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 models
 out
 there.
 There's
 a
 lot


of
 projects
 out
 there,
 research


projects,
 even
 things
 that
 like
 big


funded
 companies
 that
 put
 out
 there
 that


are
 cherrypicked.
 Basically,
 like
 you


take
 the
 results
 and
 you
 look
 at
 the


good
 ones
 and
 you
 just
 use
 those
 for


your
 demo
 or
 like
 for
 your
 launch.
 So


that's
 called
 cherrypicking.
 So
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 cherry
 picking
 happening
 in
 in


models.
 When
 you
 when
 we
 look
 at
 the


model,
 first
 thing
 we
 do
 is
 we
 take
 the


model,
 we
 run
 the
 model
 and
 we
 run
 bunch


of
 queries
 to
 understand
 like
 is
 it


actually
 doing
 the
 thing
 that
 is


advertised
 and
 then
 we
 we
 will
 go
 and


optimize
 it
 and
 make
 sure
 like
 it
 can


run
 faster
 and
 faster
 especially
 if


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 demand.
 Developers
 like


they
 spend
 so
 much
 time
 optimizing
 their


like
 iterative
 loop,
 right?
 Like
 making


sure
 that
 like
 once
 they
 do
 something


they
 can
 see
 the
 result,
 they
 can
 see


the
 tests
 and
 go
 iterate.
 So
 no
 one


wants
 to
 like
 sit
 and
 wait
 around
 5


minutes
 for
 a
 video
 to
 generate
 in
 the


future.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 be
 seconds.


It's
 going
 to
 be
 real
 time
 and
 we're


we're
 preparing
 ourselves
 from


infrastructure
 standpoint
 for
 that


future.


Scaling
 the
 company
 has
 been
 one
 of
 the


like
 most
 exciting
 things
 about
 this
 job


to
 be
 honest.
 We
 were
 like
 very
 small


team
 like
 six
 people
 for
 the
 first
 two


years
 almost.
 I
 think
 small
 teams
 is


very
 important
 before
 product
 market


fit.
 You
 actually
 do
 want
 to
 have
 like


the
 smallest
 team
 that
 you
 can,
 right?


And
 and
 and
 experiment
 and
 like
 have
 a


small
 group
 making
 decisions
 and
 move


really
 really
 fast.
 I
 think
 this
 like


alignment
 with
 the
 company's
 mission
 is


very
 important.
 This
 is
 something
 people


talk
 about.
 This
 is
 another
 thing
 like
 I


really
 learned
 from
 Coinbase.
 Like


Coinbase
 early
 days
 like
 everyone
 was
 a


crypto
 head.
 you
 would
 not
 find
 anybody


that
 is
 not,
 you
 know,
 just
 insanely


excited
 about
 crypto
 and
 and
 that


created
 the
 foundation
 for
 the
 company


that
 that
 is
 just
 so
 it's
 just
 so


specific
 and
 so
 like,
 you
 know,
 just
 by


default
 people
 are
 just
 excited
 about


what
 they're
 working
 on,
 you
 know.
 But


one
 of
 my
 criteria
 was
 that
 like
 I
 had


to
 love
 I
 had
 to
 love
 it,
 you
 know.
 That


was
 like
 super
 important
 to
 me.
 like
 the


intersection
 of
 creativity
 and
 AI.
 I


mean,
 there's
 like
 unlimited
 fun
 there.


At least
 for
 me,
 I
 wake
 up
 every
 day,


I'm
 very
 excited
 about
 like
 the
 next


models
 that
 are
 released,
 what
 this
 tech


where
 this
 technology
 is
 going,
 like


what
 amazing
 things
 are
 people
 building.


Uh
 it
 it
 is
 it
 is
 literally
 like
 the


most
 fun
 thing
 I
 could
 be
 I
 could
 be


doing.
 If
 I
 wasn't
 doing
 this,
 I
 would


probably
 go
 play
 with
 these
 models


myself.
 I
 I
 love
 this
 technology
 and
 and


that's
 the
 thing
 that's
 like
 that
 that


you
 know
 gives
 me
 a
 lot
 of
 drive
