hi
 everybody
 tune
 in
 to
 this
 short


version
 of
 the
 podcast
 which
 we
 do
 every


Friday
 for
 the
 long
 version
 tune
 in
 on


Wednesdays
 hi
 everybody
 I'm
 Nicola


tangan
 the
 CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian


Sovereign
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today
 I'm
 here


with
 Stan
 Ren
 Miller
 a
 proper
 legend
 in


the
 investment
 World
 Stan
 what
 a


pleasure
 to
 be
 here
 happy
 to
 see
 you


niai
 now
 what
 are
 the
 most
 important


data
 you're
 looking
 at
 these
 days


currently
 yeah
 interestingly
 enough
 I'm


known
 as
 a
 macro
 investor
 but
 I
 do
 our


macro
 from
 the
 bottom
 up
 so
 we're


listening
 primarily
 to
 companies
 and


we're
 not
 seeing
 any
 material
 signs
 of


weakness
 other
 than
 maybe
 in
 the
 housing


market
 but
 that's
 from
 a
 very
 elevated


price
 level
 so
 we're
 not
 seeing
 bottom


up
 in
 information
 indicating
 to
 us
 that


there's
 an
 economic
 problem
 anytime
 in


the
 next
 3
 to
 6
 months
 I
 would
 also
 say


I'm
 revealing
 now
 that
 I'm
 more
 of
 a


market
 animal
 than
 an
 economist
 that
 we


look
 at
 Financial


conditions
 they've
 been
 very
 very
 loose


I
 mean
 there
 is
 looser
 looser
 than
 they


were
 when
 the
 FED
 actually
 started


tightening
 they've
 tightened


considerably
 in
 the


last
 four
 or
 five
 weeks
 ever
 since
 the


ironically
 ever
 since
 the
 FED
 cut


because
 the
 dollar
 has
 rallied
 and


obviously
 interest
 rates
 have
 gone
 up


but
 they're
 still
 they're
 still
 quite


above
 normal
 so
 that's
 pretty
 much
 the


data
 we're
 looking
 at
 how
 big
 a
 problem


is
 the
 budget
 deficit
 as
 a
 practitioner


it's
 something
 I
 can't
 be
 obsessed
 with


on
 a
 3
 to
 six
 month
 basis
 as
 an
 American


it's
 something
 I'm
 really
 obsessed
 with


because
 debt
 to
 GDP
 can't
 go
 up
 forever


and
 to
 me
 we
 have
 a
 reckoning
 but
 I


don't
 know
 how
 the
 time
 when
 that's


going
 to
 take
 place
 I
 will
 say
 that


because
 the
 reserve
 currency


we've
 been
 permitted
 to
 engage
 in


behavior
 that
 say
 the
 Brits
 couldn't


have
 behaved
 in
 there's
 a
 new
 term
 I


have
 getting
 LZ
 trust
 we
 haven't
 been
 L


trust
 because
 we
 are
 the
 reserve


currency
 even
 though
 if
 you
 look
 at


everything
 we're
 doing
 it's
 much
 more


radical
 than
 the
 Brits
 were
 doing
 yeah


um
 what's
 that
 old
 saying
 how
 do
 you
 go


bankrupt
 slowly
 and
 then
 suddenly


running
 deficits
 with
 full
 employment
 at


basically
 at
 7%
 of


GDP
 is
 a
 recipe
 that
 can't
 last
 forever


one
 of
 the
 reasons
 we
 haven't
 paid
 for


it
 is
 in
 Co
 the
 entire
 private
 sector


80%
 of
 individuals
 refinance
 their


mortgages
 so
 the
 average
 mortgage
 rate


is
 still
 under
 4%
 even
 though
 at
 the


margin
 it
 got
 to
 8%
 corporations
 termed


out
 their
 debt
 that
 stuff
 rolls
 over
 in


25
 and
 26
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a


problem
 it's
 probably
 more
 like
 late
 25


early
 26
 but
 you
 just
 don't
 know
 so
 how


do
 you
 think
 the
 Tech
 sector
 will


develop
 what
 kind
 of
 science
 are
 you


seeing
 there
 the
 AI
 boom
 is
 going


unabated
 niai
 what
 he
 said
 that
 you
 look


at
 honestly
 uh
 I've
 got
 young
 really


good
 analysts
 here
 yeah
 a
 lot
 of
 people


have
 a
 lot
 of
 young
 analysts
 who
 are
 who


are
 on
 top
 of
 things
 and
 they
 started
 um


we
 noticed
 about
 three
 or
 four
 years
 ago


that
 the
 kids
 that
 go
 to
 Stanford
 and


MIT
 the
 engineers
 were
 shifting
 from


crypto
 to


I
 that
 was
 the
 first
 signed
 then
 my
 my


young
 Partners
 started
 talking
 more
 and


more
 about
 AI
 uh
 I
 asked
 them
 how
 to


play
 it
 they
 mentioned
 a
 company
 called


Nvidia
 which
 I
 thought
 was
 a
 gaming


company
 I
 hadn't
 done
 work
 on
 in
 a
 long


time
 um
 I
 bought
 a
 pretty
 good
 chunk
 of


it
 and
 then
 like
 a
 month
 later
 chaty
 PT


happened
 it
 was
 just
 total
 luck
 I
 had
 no


idea
 chy
 PT
 but
 the
 AI
 drum
 around
 here


was
 big
 enough
 and
 the
 stock
 was
 down
 I


think
 from
 400
 to
 150
 or
 something
 so


that's
 how
 I
 got
 started
 in
 it
 once
 we


invest
 in
 something
 like
 that
 then
 we


really
 start
 to
 dig
 deeper
 and
 then


there
 was
 a
 whole
 chain
 of


things
 when
 we
 last
 met
 you
 mentioned


the
 concept
 of
 buy
 first
 analyze
 later


tell
 me
 about
 that
 yeah
 Soros
 used
 to


call
 it
 invest
 and
 invest
 and
 then


investigate
 I
 think
 I
 just
 gave
 a


classic
 example
 I
 didn't
 know
 that
 much


about
 Nvidia
 I
 just
 knew
 that
 Ai
 and
 I


had
 some
 people
 here
 tell
 me
 how
 to
 play


it
 so
 we
 bought
 Nvidia
 and
 then
 we
 we


were
 in
 the
 process
 of
 doing
 a
 lot
 more


work
 and
 then
 chat
 GPT
 happened
 but
 I've


always
 had
 the
 view
 that
 markets
 are


smart
 they're
 fast
 and
 they're
 getting


much
 more
 so
 with
 with
 all
 the


communication
 and
 the
 technology
 we
 have


today
 and
 that
 if
 I
 hear
 a
 concept
 and
 I


like
 it
 uh
 if
 I
 wait
 and
 spend
 two
 or


three
 months
 analyzing
 it
 I
 may
 miss
 big


part
 of
 the
 move
 and
 then


psychologically
 be
 paralyzed
 it's
 hard


to
 buy
 a
 stock
 you're
 looking
 at
 at
 100


it's
 160
 even
 if
 it's
 going
 to
 400


somehow
 your
 your
 head
 is
 screwed
 up
 and


you're
 waiting
 for
 the
 pullback
 so
 we


will
 we
 will
 buy
 something
 a
 meaningful


position
 but
 not
 Earth
 shaking
 and
 then


really
 do
 the
 work
 and
 if
 I
 think
 we


made
 a
 mistake
 I'll
 sell
 it
 and
 if
 I


don't
 think
 we
 made
 a
 mistake
 will
 add


to
 it
 if
 if
 we
 have
 to
 yeah
 no
 I
 I
 I


happen
 to
 have
 worked
 exactly
 the
 same


way
 uh
 in
 my
 life
 it
 it
 really
 focuses


in
 your
 your
 work
 and
 your
 efforts
 and


your
 thinking
 but
 have
 you
 always


believed
 in
 your
 own
 pattern
 recognition


yes
 when
 I
 started
 in
 the
 business
 I
 got


promoted
 too
 early
 so
 before
 I
 had


really
 learned
 the
 nuts
 and
 bols
 of
 the


analysis
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 I
 should


have
 I
 was
 promoted
 to
 to
 a
 to
 a


leadership
 position
 and
 I
 had
 to
 rely
 a


lot
 on
 charts
 and
 I
 had
 to
 rely
 a
 lot
 on


intuition
 what
 I
 learned
 from


Soros
 is
 when
 you
 have


conviction
 you
 should
 bet
 really
 big
 I


know
 your
 listeners
 have
 probably
 heard


it
 before
 but
 I
 but
 probably
 the
 best


illustration
 is
 the
 pound
 yeah
 so
 what


happen
 so
 let's
 go
 back
 so
 you
 are
 in


the
 office
 what's
 happening
 in
 the
 UK


the
 day
 I
 believe
 was
 September
 15th


that
 I
 would
 remember
 um
 I
 read
 the


financial
 times
 and
 the
 head
 of
 the


bunis


bank
 now
 I'm
 sh
 I'm
 AG
 but
 I'm
 pretty


sure
 it
 was
 te
 Meer
 has
 written
 an


editorial
 in
 the
 financial
 times


basically
 in
 more
 proper
 language
 but


he's
 basically
 saying
 that
 the
 deut
 mark


and
 the
 pound
 should
 no
 longer
 be
 linked


so
 I
 decide
 to
 take
 Duan
 and
 the
 quantum


fund
 to
 100%


long
 the


deark
 short
 the
 pound
 cuz
 it's
 still
 a


half
 a%c
 unbelievably
 now
 you're
 going


to
 hear
 vintage
 Soros
 so
 he
 happens
 to


be
 in
 New
 York
 at
 the
 time
 which
 he


wasn't
 always
 I
 go
 into
 his


office
 and
 I
 explained
 to


him
 why
 I'm
 going
 to


100%
 And
 he
 had
 a
 rather
 large
 personal


account
 that's
 how
 we
 kept
 each
 other


out
 of
 each
 other's
 hair
 he
 traded
 that


and
 you
 know
 was
 90
 90
 95%
 overlap
 told


him
 why
 I
 was
 doing
 this
 and
 he
 had
 this


um
 unpleasant
 puzzled
 look
 on
 his
 face


when
 I'm
 telling
 him
 my
 thesis
 that
 this


one
 economy
 is
 booming
 and
 they
 need


higher
 rates
 this
 other
 economy
 is


falling
 apart
 they
 need
 lower
 rates
 that


these
 two
 currencies
 shouldn't
 be


linked
 and
 I'm
 thinking
 what
 does
 he
 not


understand
 about
 this
 cuz
 this
 guy


pretty
 much
 understood
 everything
 and
 he


says
 uh
 look
 this
 is
 uh
 this
 is
 a


one-way
 bet
 they
 come
 along
 very
 very


rarely
 it's
 ridiculous
 doing
 100%
 we


should
 put
 200%
 of
 the
 fund
 in
 this


trade
 so
 there
 you
 have


it
 now
 you
 took
 um
 sabatical
 in
 2000


yeah
 what
 was
 the
 reason
 behind


that
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 painful
 but
 really


fun
 Story
 the
 fund
 is
 down
 like


177%
 and
 Duane
 is
 down
 7
 %
 and
 uh
 I'm


just
 exhausted
 I've
 been
 running
 this


high-profile
 fund
 for
 12
 years
 so
 I
 sell


everything
 out
 everything
 of


Duane
 send
 my
 investors
 a
 letter
 and
 say


uh
 I'm
 going
 on
 a
 sabatical
 I
 don't
 know


whether
 I'm
 coming
 back
 or
 not
 you
 can


take
 all
 your
 money
 out
 but
 if
 you
 take


your
 money
 out
 if
 I
 decide
 to
 come
 back


I
 can't
 guarantee
 I'll
 let
 you
 back
 in
 I


think
 I
 had
 like
 200
 their
 clients
 one


of
 them
 pulled
 their
 money
 I
 remember


who
 it
 was
 but
 they'll
 remain
 anous
