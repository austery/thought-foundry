Governor,
 thank
 you
 for
 taking
 the
 time.


Selfishly,
 it's
 always
 just
 good
 to
 get


out
 of
 DC
 and
 touch
 grass,
 you
 know,


bluegrass
 or
 otherwise.


Bloomberg's
 White
 House
 reporter
 Josh


Windrove
 took
 a
 trip
 down
 to
 the


Kentucky
 State
 Capital
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago


to
 sit
 down
 with
 Governor
 Andy
 Basher.


Welcome
 to
 Frankfurt.
 Thank
 you,
 Kylie.


They
 met
 inside
 the
 old
 governor's


mansion
 in
 Basher's
 office,
 which


featured
 some
 very
 Kentucky
 touches.


He
 has
 a
 bottle
 of
 bourbon
 with
 his


dog's
 face
 on
 it,
 sealed,
 I
 should
 note.


We
 did
 not
 get
 to


crack
 that.
 Didn't
 crack
 that
 open.


Heartbreaking.
 But
 he
 also
 has
 a
 KFC


bucket
 with
 his
 own
 face
 on
 it.
 So,


leaning
 into
 the
 brand
 a
 little
 bit.


Bourbon
 and
 bluegrass
 music
 and
 Kentucky


Fried
 Chicken.
 These
 are
 just
 a
 few
 of


Kucky's
 most
 famous
 exports.


But
 Josh
 says
 there's
 a
 lot
 more
 to


Kucky's
 economy
 than
 that.
 The
 one-time


coal
 producing
 center
 is
 also
 an


automanufacturing
 juggernaut,
 an


aerospace
 hub,
 and
 one
 of
 the
 country's


most
 prolific
 importers.


Kentucky
 kind
 of
 flies
 under
 the
 radar


as
 a
 trade
 exposed
 state.
 Its
 imports


are
 the
 top
 in
 the
 country
 as
 a
 share
 of


their
 economy.
 You
 might
 think
 Michigan


or
 other
 states
 that
 jump
 to
 mind
 more


as
 big
 manufacturing
 states,
 but
 it's


Kentucky.
 And
 right
 now
 it's
 in
 the


crossfire
 of
 the
 trade
 war.


The
 stuff
 they
 are
 building
 is
 being
 hit


with
 import
 tariffs
 and
 the
 stuff


they're
 selling,
 namely
 bourbon,
 but


other
 things
 including
 aerospace,
 is


being
 affected
 as
 well
 with
 potential


countermeasures,
 countries
 boycotting
 or


applying
 their
 own
 tariffs.


Though
 the
 pace
 of
 tariff
 news
 has


slowed
 since
 the
 summer,
 the
 whiplash


isn't
 over.
 On
 Friday,
 President
 Donald


Trump
 threatened
 a
 new
 100%
 tariff
 on


Chinese
 goods.
 But
 then
 over
 the


weekend,
 he
 softened,
 signaling
 the
 US


would
 be
 open
 to
 further
 negotiations.


And
 next
 month,
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 will


start
 hearing
 oral
 arguments
 in
 a
 case


that
 will
 decide
 whether
 Trump's


reciprocal
 tariffs
 are
 even
 legal.
 As


Trump's
 tariff
 policies
 start
 to
 hit


Kucky's
 key
 industries,
 the
 red
 state's


Democratic
 governor
 has
 been
 vocal
 about


the
 consequences
 for
 his
 constituents.


The
 impacts
 are
 are
 hitting
 the
 economy


in
 Kentucky
 and
 across
 the
 country.
 They


haven't
 been
 fully
 felt
 yet.
 And
 part
 of


that
 is
 because
 it's
 constantly


changing,
 right?
 But
 what
 we
 will
 see
 in


the
 United
 States
 is
 increased
 costs
 on


our
 people.


Basher
 is
 one
 of
 the
 only
 Democrats
 in


Kentucky
 state
 leadership.
 But
 he's
 not


the
 only
 Kentucky
 politician
 who's


taking
 the
 administration
 to
 task
 over


Trump's
 trade
 war.
 There's
 Kentucky


Senator
 Ran
 Paul.


So
 the
 number
 one
 issue
 I
 get
 wherever
 I


go
 in
 the
 state
 is
 tariffs
 are
 killing


the
 family
 farm.
 term
 tariffs
 are


killing
 the
 bourbon
 industry.
 Tariff
 is


killing
 the
 the
 cargo
 transport


industry.
 So,


and
 Kucky's
 other
 senator,
 Mitch


McConnell,


put
 me
 down
 as
 a
 guy
 who
 hopes
 the
 trade


war
 isn't
 very
 long
 because
 if
 it's


prolonged,
 it
 means
 higher
 prices
 for


all
 of
 you,
 for
 everything.


State
 Congressman
 Thomas
 Massie
 has
 been


a
 vocal
 tariff
 critic,
 too.
 All
 three
 of


them
 Republicans.
 The
 one
 thing
 they


seem
 to
 agree
 on
 down
 there
 is
 tariffs


are
 a
 bad
 idea.
 Or
 at least
 the
 way


they're
 being
 done
 is
 a
 bad
 idea.


I'm
 Sarah
 Holder
 and
 this
 is
 the
 Big


Take
 from
 Bloomberg
 News.
 Today
 on
 the


show,
 more
 from
 Josh's
 interview
 with


Kentucky
 Governor
 Andy
 Basher.
 What


Trump's
 trade
 war
 and
 domestic
 policy


agenda
 means
 for
 the
 red
 state's
 economy


and
 for
 its
 voters.


[Music]


President
 Trump
 announced
 his
 sweeping


global
 tariffs
 a
 few
 months
 into
 the


start
 of
 his
 second
 term.


April
 2nd,
 2025
 will
 forever
 be


remembered
 as
 the
 day
 American
 industry


was
 reborn,
 the
 day
 America's
 destiny


was
 reclaimed,
 and
 the
 day
 that
 we
 began


to
 make
 America
 wealthy
 again.
 After


months
 of
 negotiations,
 escalations,


downgrades,
 and
 delays,
 most
 of
 those


tariffs
 went
 into
 effect
 on
 August
 7th.


But
 that
 hasn't
 been
 the
 end
 of
 the


story.


So,
 we've
 now
 gone
 from
 across
 the
 board


to
 reciprocal
 to
 industry
 specific
 to


company
 specific,
 and
 now
 we
 are
 at


product
 specific.


Kentucky
 Governor
 Andy
 Basher.
 Again,


the
 only
 thing
 that
 doesn't
 change
 is


that
 it's
 going
 to
 change
 every
 day.


Bloomberg
 White
 House
 reporter
 Josh


Windgrove
 wanted
 to
 talk
 to
 Governor


Basher
 because
 Kentucky
 is
 in
 some
 ways


a
 microcosm
 of
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 US
 as


local
 economies
 adapt
 to
 these
 shifting


tariff
 policies.
 But
 Kentucky
 is
 also


uniquely
 vulnerable.


Kentucky
 is
 a
 crossroads
 state,
 right?


It
 is
 near
 the
 manufacturing
 heartlands


of,
 you
 know,
 Michigan,
 Ohio,
 but
 a


gateway
 between
 the
 coasts
 and
 sort
 of


middle
 and
 southern
 America.
 And
 that's


why
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 logistics
 hubs


type
 of
 business.
 That's
 why
 they
 have
 a


lot
 of
 manufacturing.
 Ford
 has
 a
 huge


plant
 there.
 Bourbon,
 of
 course,
 has


been
 an
 iconic
 part
 of
 their
 industry
 as


well.
 It's
 sold
 a
 lot
 domestically,
 but


it's
 sold
 a
 lot
 internationally,
 too,


and
 is
 is
 often
 targeted
 because


countries
 tend
 to
 look
 for
 sort
 of


tangible
 things
 to
 hit,
 whether
 it's


Florida
 orange
 juice
 or
 Kentucky


bourbon.
 And
 that's
 why
 these
 tariff


fights
 tend
 to
 bite
 in
 places
 like
 this.


Levies
 on
 imports
 are
 hitting
 the


state's
 manufacturing
 sector,
 while


retaliatory
 measures
 from
 other
 trading


partners
 are
 affecting
 the
 state's


exports.


So,
 for
 instance,
 bourbon
 is
 an
 export,


but
 is
 being
 impacted
 because
 people
 are


simply
 refusing
 to
 buy
 it
 because


they're
 ticked
 off.
 Kucky's
 main
 export


country
 is
 Canada.
 The
 Canadians
 are
 up


in
 arms
 right
 now
 cuz
 Trump
 is
 more
 or


less
 trying
 to
 annex
 the
 country.
 And


then
 there's
 individual
 tariffs
 like
 on


steel
 and
 aluminum.
 Well,
 if
 you
 have
 a


car
 plant,
 you
 use
 a
 lot
 of
 steel
 and


aluminum.
 And
 so
 Ford
 is
 navigating


that.


[Music]


Ford
 employs
 more
 than
 10,000
 workers
 in


Kentucky.
 And
 Basher
 told
 Josh
 the
 state


depends
 on
 the
 company's
 continued


success.


Ford
 has
 been
 a
 huge
 investor
 in


Kentucky
 uh
 over
 the
 last
 5
 years,
 5
 and


a
 half
 years
 since
 I've
 been
 governor.


Now,
 we
 also
 have
 the
 largest
 Toyota


manufacturing
 facility
 in
 the
 world
 in


our
 state.
 What
 Ford
 is
 saying
 is
 that


they
 believe
 that
 this
 chaotic
 policy


that
 is
 not
 being
 done
 through
 normal


channels,
 that
 is
 not
 having
 the
 experts


that
 understand
 the
 auto
 industry
 and


how
 to
 create
 a
 level
 playing
 field,


they're
 not
 being
 consulted.


Trump
 says
 his
 tariffs
 are
 designed
 to


help
 revive
 American
 manufacturing.
 The


industry
 has
 lost
 more
 than
 5
 million


jobs
 and
 nearly
 70,000
 factories
 since


the
 '90s.
 But
 in
 Kentucky,
 manufacturing


is
 a
 major
 driver
 of
 its
 economy.
 13%
 of


the
 workforce
 is
 employed
 in
 the
 sector.


And
 Basher
 told
 Josh
 that
 in
 his
 state,


Trump's
 tariff
 policies
 are
 putting
 that


success
 at
 risk.


The
 president
 might
 think
 he's
 helping


domestic
 manufacturers,
 but
 in
 fact,


he's
 hurting
 them.


People
 think
 about
 manufacturing,
 think


about
 giant
 plants,
 right?
 But


manufacturing
 can
 be
 pretty
 small,
 too.


And
 you
 think
 of
 like
 small
 companies


that
 let's
 say
 input
 their
 materials


from
 China,
 build
 it
 in
 America,
 sell
 it


in
 America,
 employ
 Americans.
 What


should
 that
 company
 do?
 Cuz
 right
 now


they're
 kind
 of
 caught
 in
 the
 middle
 of


it.
 Trump
 thinks
 that
 if
 you
 want
 to


avoid
 tariffs,
 you're
 just
 going
 to


build
 a
 big
 new
 factory
 in
 a
 place
 like


Kentucky.
 Well,
 you
 might,
 but
 then
 you


have
 to
 pay
 the
 other
 tariffs
 that
 he's


charging,
 for
 instance,
 on
 steel
 to


build
 that
 factory.
 And
 that
 might
 just


get
 too
 complicated
 for
 you.
 Or
 you


might
 be
 doing
 it
 at
 a
 time
 when
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 questions
 about
 the
 economy
 and


you're
 worried
 about
 consumer
 demand,


you
 know,
 maybe
 falling
 and
 you're
 like,


ah,
 no,
 I'll
 just
 kind
 of
 hold
 off
 and


wait.
 And
 if
 every
 company
 holds
 off
 and


waits
 and
 suddenly
 things
 grind
 to
 a


halt
 pretty
 quickly
 and
 so
 I
 think
 that


that
 is
 why
 manufacturing
 is
 so
 often


seen
 as
 a
 canary
 in
 the
 coal
 mine,
 if


you'll
 excuse
 the
 completely
 inadvertent


Kentucky
 pun,
 because
 it
 is
 sort
 of
 a


bellweather.
 I'm
 wondering
 if
 Basher


sees
 any
 benefits
 for
 domestic


automakers
 from
 tariffs
 when
 it
 comes
 to


helping
 them
 compete
 globally,
 for


example.
 How
 does
 Basher
 see
 the
 long


game
 here
 and
 how
 does
 he
 talk
 about
 it?


So,
 it's
 funny
 because
 one
 of
 the
 things


Trump
 has
 done
 is
 sort
 of
 shift
 the


consensus
 on
 this,
 right?
 Republicans


were
 the
 anti-tariff
 party
 until
 Donald


Trump
 came
 along.
 So,
 Governor
 Basher's


position
 is
 steel
 and
 aluminum
 tariffs,


for
 instance,
 can
 be
 appropriate
 when


targeted.
 When
 you
 have
 China
 dumping
 uh


steel
 and
 or
 aluminum,
 then
 a
 targeted


tariff
 that
 is
 done
 through
 the
 regular


process
 that
 brings
 in
 the
 experts
 on


the
 amount
 those
 those
 can
 be
 helpful
 to


ensure
 the
 US
 economy
 has
 certain


manufacturing
 that
 is
 critical
 to
 our


national
 security


without
 being
 hollowed
 out
 by
 the


Chinese.


Exactly.
 So
 for
 Governor
 Basher
 on
 the


auto
 piece,
 it's
 interesting
 because


yeah,
 I
 think
 Trump
 likes
 the
 idea
 of


tariffing
 foreign
 autos
 to
 help
 domestic


automakers.
 The
 problem
 is
 the


sequencing
 so
 far
 has
 hurt
 domestic


automakers,
 right?
 Ford
 in
 Kentucky
 is


the
 domestic
 automaker
 that
 makes
 most


of
 its
 cars
 in
 the
 US.
 And
 right
 now


they
 are
 at
 a
 disadvantage
 against
 the


Japanese
 rivals
 because
 of
 the
 way
 the


tariffs
 have
 all
 shaken
 out.
 But
 it
 is


complicated
 because
 GM,
 for
 instance,
 is


a
 major
 importer,
 including
 from
 South


Korea.
 And
 so
 they're
 kind
 of
 caught
 in


the
 middle
 of
 it,
 too.
 If
 they
 pay
 a
 15%


tariff
 on
 a
 car
 they
 make
 in
 South
 Korea


and
 pay
 input
 tariffs
 on
 cars
 they
 make


in
 America
 and
 have
 to
 like
 have
 a
 hired


paid
 worker
 or
 this
 or
 that,
 it
 might


actually
 incentivize
 them
 to
 shift
 more


production
 to
 South
 Korea
 than
 having
 it


in
 places
 like
 Kentucky
 or
 wherever
 in


the
 United
 States.


Basher
 is
 far
 from
 the
 only
 one
 raising


concerns
 about
 the
 way
 Trump's
 tariffs


have
 been
 rolled
 out.
 Following
 a
 wave


of
 lawsuits
 filed
 by
 businesses
 and


state
 attorneys
 general,
 the
 US
 Court
 of


International
 Trade
 ruled
 the
 president


does
 not
 have
 the
 authority
 to
 use
 the


International
 Emergency
 Economic
 Powers


Act
 to
 impose
 tariffs.
 There's
 a
 stay
 on


the
 case
 while
 the
 Trump
 administration


appeals
 to
 the
 US
 Supreme
 Court,
 which


will
 start
 hearing
 oral
 arguments
 on


November
 5th.
 My
 hope
 is
 that
 the


lawsuit
 brought
 by
 Democratic
 Attorneys


General
 both
 in
 the
 International
 Court


of
 Trade
 uh
 as
 well
 as
 in
 a
 district


court
 reaches
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 and
 they


rule
 what
 any
 other
 Supreme
 Court
 would


have
 that
 the
 president
 doesn't
 have
 the


power
 to
 change
 tariffs
 on
 a
 whim.
 This


is
 the
 pre
 a
 president
 who
 wants
 to


simply
 set
 any
 tariff
 any
 time
 for
 any


reason
 and
 the
 law
 doesn't
 allow
 that.


After
 the
 break,
 Kucky's
 manufacturing


industry
 is
 up
 against
 more
 than
 just


tariffs.
 What
 a
 roll
 back
 of
 green


energy
 policies
 means
 for
 the
 Kentucky


automakers
 who've
 gone
 allin
 on
 EVs.


[Music]


Kentucky
 wasn't
 always
 the
 manufacturing


hub
 it
 is
 now.
 For
 most
 of
 the
 20th


century,
 it
 was
 known
 as
 one
 of
 the


country's
 top
 coal
 producers.


When
 you
 look
 at
 the
 coal
 miners
 of


Eastern
 Kentucky,
 West
 Virginia,
 and


elsewhere,
 they
 mined
 the
 coal
 that


powered
 the
 industrial
 revolution,
 that


created
 the
 strongest
 middle
 class
 the


world's
 ever
 seen,
 that
 powered
 us


through
 two
 world
 wars.


But
 when
 the
 US
 started
 investing
 more


in
 green
 energy
 sources,
 Kentucky


Governor
 Andy
 Basher
 says
 a
 lot
 of


miners
 were
 left
 behind
 in
 the


transition.
 Yet,
 when
 the
 energy
 economy


changed,
 they
 weren't
 thanked.
 In
 many


instances,
 they
 were
 told
 they
 were


doing
 something
 bad.
 And
 the
 new
 jobs


didn't
 go
 where
 the
 old
 jobs
 were.
 You


know,
 everybody
 was
 talking
 about


environmental
 justice.
 At
 the
 time,
 no


one
 was
 talking
 about
 economic
 justice.


And
 these
 people
 that
 broke
 their
 backs


to
 help
 build
 this
 country
 were
 left


behind.


Basher
 told
 Bloomberg
 White
 House


reporter
 Josh
 Windgrove
 that
 his


priority
 now
 is
 diversifying
 Kucky's


economy.
 I
 recognize
 that
 climate
 change


is
 real
 and
 I'm
 the
 first
 Kentucky


governor
 that's
 ever
 said
 that
 phrase


out
 loud.
 I
 say
 it
 because
 it's
 true.


And
 we're
 not
 likely
 to
 see
 a
 rebound
 in


older
 areas
 of
 energy
 generation.
 Why?


Because
 every
 company
 that's
 coming
 to


Kentucky
 is
 still
 telling
 me
 that
 they


want
 to
 be
 more
 sustainable,
 is
 still


asking
 for
 um
 more
 diversity
 in
 their


energy
 portfolio.
 And
 so
 for
 me,
 if
 I


want
 to
 recruit
 that
 next
 set
 of
 jobs,


I've
 got
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 have


multiple
 means
 of
 energy
 production,


including
 more
 renewables.


A
 large
 part
 of
 Kucky's
 industrial


diversification
 has
 come
 in
 the
 form
 of


electric
 vehicles.
 Since
 Basher
 took


office,
 the
 state
 has
 become
 a
 key


player
 in
 the
 EV
 supply
 chain,


attracting
 billions
 of
 dollars
 in
 EV


related
 investments
 in
 cars,
 parts,
 and


batteries.


One
 of
 the
 most
 significant
 EV
 related


projects
 in
 Kentucky
 is
 a
 joint
 venture


between
 South
 Korea's
 SK
 and
 Ford
 called


Blue
 Oval.


Side
 note,
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 think
 we're


supposed
 to
 pronounce
 Blue
 Oval
 as
 like


Louisville.


Blueville.


Like
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 pun.


Oh,
 okay.


Blueville.
 Blueville.


Blueville.


I
 think
 as
 non-Kuckians,
 let's
 say
 Blue


Oval,
 but
 I
 think
 it
 is
 a
 it
 is
 a
 nod
 to


the
 local
 pronunciation
 of
 Louisville.


No,
 thank
 you.


After
 receiving
 a
 nearly
 $10
 billion


loan
 from
 Biden's
 Department
 of
 Energy


at
 the
 end
 of
 last
 year,
 Blue
 began


producing
 batteries
 for
 Ford's
 F-150


Lightning
 pickup
 truck
 in
 August.


And
 so
 to
 us,
 it
 was
 incredible
 first
 to


secure
 Blue
 Oval
 and
 that
 has
 two


plants.
 Kentucky
 One
 is
 up
 and
 operating


already
 over
 1,400
 employees.
 Kentucky


2,
 they
 are
 fully
 constructing.
 The
 only


question
 is
 when
 it
 will
 go
 into


operation.
 And
 what
 that's
 done
 is


brought
 in
 billions
 of
 dollars
 of


additional
 investment,
 a
 supply
 chain


that
 doesn't
 currently
 exist.


But
 since
 Trump
 was
 sworn
 in,
 the


battery
 plant
 has
 been
 facing
 headwinds.


Amid
 a
 broader
 roll
 back
 in
 green
 energy


investment,
 the
 federal
 EV
 tax
 credit


expired
 in
 September,
 and
 demand
 for


electric
 vehicles
 has
 been
 slowing.


That's
 affected
 demand
 for
 Blue
 Ovil's


batteries.


It
 is
 sort
 of
 facing
 uncertainty
 because


it
 was
 meant
 to
 build
 batteries
 for
 the


F-150
 Lightning,
 Ford's
 electric
 truck.


Demand
 for
 that
 has
 just
 not
 been


anywhere
 near
 where
 Ford
 thought
 it


would
 be.


Ford
 lost
 about
 $5
 billion
 on
 its
 EV


business
 last
 year.
 And
 the
 company
 said


it
 could
 lose
 even
 more
 this
 year.


Meanwhile,
 Trump's
 immigration
 policies


are
 also
 ratcheting
 up
 uncertainty
 for


the
 Blue
 Ovil
 project.
 In
 September,
 ICE


officials
 raided
 a
 Hyundai
 battery
 plant


in
 Georgia.
 They
 arrested
 475
 people,


mostly
 South
 Korean
 immigrants.


And
 so,
 the
 big
 question
 right
 now
 is


what
 impact
 does
 that
 Georgia
 raid
 have


on
 every
 other
 Korean
 project
 in
 the


country,
 including
 the
 Blue
 Oval
 joint


venture
 in
 Louisville,
 including
 other


South
 Korean
 projects
 in
 Kentucky
 and


future
 projects.


There's
 a
 potential
 chilling
 effect.


Chilling
 effect.
 It
 is
 a
 huge
 diplomatic


crisis.
 Hanging
 in
 the
 balance
 of
 all


this
 is
 President
 Trump's
 trade
 deal


with
 Korea.
 Its
 tariffs
 and
 its


immigration
 and
 its
 investment
 and
 its


trade.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 all
 kind
 of
 one


story.


Despite
 these
 challenges,
 Josh
 says
 Ford


is
 committed
 to
 building
 its
 EV
 business


in
 Kentucky.
 It's
 spending
 $2
 billion
 to


build
 budget
 electric
 cars
 at
 its


Louisville
 plant.
 And
 as
 for
 the


Kentucky
 governor,
 his
 faith
 in
 the


industry
 hasn't
 been
 shaken.
 What
 you


see
 is
 Ford
 and
 what
 I
 see
 is
 every


other
 major
 manufacturer
 is
 still


continuing
 to
 make
 EV
 investments.
 A
 lot


of
 people
 have
 tried
 to
 fight
 the
 future


and
 no
 one's
 ever
 won.
 EVs
 are
 where
 the


world
 is
 going
 in
 terms
 of
 automotive.


The
 question
 is
 the
 pace
 or
 speed
 at


which
 it
 moves.
 In
 Kentucky,
 we
 also


know
 what
 happens
 if
 you
 aren't
 on
 the


forefront
 of
 change
 in
 an
 industry.
 I


will
 not
 let
 that
 happen
 in
 the


automotive
 sector.
 Basher
 is
 a
 Democrat


who's
 betting
 the
 farm
 on
 EVs.
 Perhaps


it's
 not
 surprising
 to
 hear
 him
 critique


Trump's
 protectionist
 oil
 and
 gasheavy


economic
 agenda.
 But
 Basher
 told
 Josh


that
 when
 the
 economic
 consequences
 of


these
 policies
 start
 to
 hit
 Kentucky,
 he


believes
 both
 Democrats
 and
 Republicans


will
 feel
 them.


Democrats,
 including
 Governor
 Basher,


are
 still
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to


talk
 about
 the
 tariff
 question.
 In
 part


because
 it's
 not
 totally
 clear
 where


their
 own
 party
 will
 land.
 in
 part


because
 consumers
 aren't
 really
 yet


totally
 seeing
 it
 in
 the
 sticker
 shock.


They
 still
 see
 the
 inflationary
 numbers


that
 they've
 been
 dealing
 with
 for
 years


and
 you
 know
 they
 assume
 the
 prices
 have


just
 stayed
 high.
 But
 that
 sticker
 shock


is
 going
 to
 come
 and
 I
 think
 then
 we'll


see
 Democrats
 ramp
 up
 their
 messaging
 on


it.


I
 don't
 think
 you'd
 find
 many
 voters
 in


America
 who
 said
 that
 they
 went
 to
 the


polls
 and
 voted
 because
 of
 tariffs.
 What


he
 told
 them
 was
 he
 was
 going
 to
 make


paying
 bills
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 month
 a


little
 bit
 easier.
 But
 he's
 governed
 in


any
 way
 but
 what
 he
 promised.


Trump
 is
 already
 declaring
 victory,


saying
 we're
 not
 seeing
 inflation
 yet.


But
 so
 many
 people,
 including
 Governor


Basher,
 but
 other
 industries
 and


companies
 are
 saying
 it's
 just
 not
 there


yet
 because
 the
 tariffs
 are
 changing
 so


frequently.
 The
 companies
 haven't


decided
 what
 to
 do
 yet,
 but
 that


eventually
 some
 or
 all
 of
 that
 is
 going


to
 get
 passed
 on
 to
 the
 consumer.
 And


that's
 when
 this
 is,
 I
 think,
 going
 to


become
 more
 of
 a
 potent
 political
 issue.
