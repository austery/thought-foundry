We
 have a
 lot
 going
 on
 at
 Axon
 right


now.
 Uh
 between
 our
 core
 business
 really


rolling
 in
 there.
 We're
 talking
 about


tasers
 and
 body
 cams
 and
 digital


evidence
 management.
 We
 manage
 about
 40


times
 as
 much
 data
 as
 the
 Netflix


library
 in
 the
 cloud
 for
 our
 police


customers.
 And
 so
 that
 business
 has


really
 grown
 nicely.
 And
 now
 as
 we
 look


for
 uh
 both
 other
 markets,
 we're


starting
 to
 get
 really
 excited
 about
 our


enterprise
 market.
 And
 you
 mentioned
 we


we
 launched
 the
 Axon
 body
 mini
 which
 is


supposed
 to
 be
 used
 in
 retail,
 nursing


and
 other
 non-public
 safety


environments.
 And
 then
 on
 top
 of
 that
 we


continue
 to
 plug
 in
 strategic


acquisitions
 with
 uh
 more
 uh
 you
 know
 uh


newer,
 younger,
 more
 talented
 teams
 that


might
 not
 have
 hit
 that
 steepest
 part
 of


their
 growth
 trajectory
 yet
 but
 are
 well


on
 their
 way
 to
 it.
 We
 think
 that's
 a


great
 formula
 for
 us
 and
 our
 customers.


And
 when
 I
 look
 at
 your
 your
 stocks


performance,
 you've
 really
 take
 off
 in


the
 last
 few
 years.
 How
 is
 that
 being


attained?
 Like
 are
 you
 in
 terms
 of


growth,
 are
 you
 buying
 or
 expanding
 or


what
 areas
 are
 really
 driving
 that
 when


again
 look
 at
 your
 stock
 going
 pretty


much
 parabolic
 since
 call
 it
 early
 2023.


>> Can
 I
 just
 say
 339
 is
 the
 PE
 the
 current


PE
 on
 the
 stock
 and
 a
 forward-looking
 PE


of
 104.


>> Well,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 say
 that
 it's
 up


600
 more
 than
 500%
 in
 the
 last
 three


years.
 Like
 this
 is
 a
 big
 run.
 So,
 it's


so
 there's
 obviously
 something
 going
 on


or
 at least
 the
 street
 or
 investors
 are


excited
 about
 something.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 think
 ultimately
 um
 we
 we
 do
 a


few
 things
 really
 really
 well.
 Uh
 we


grow
 revenue
 profitably.
 So
 there
 we're


talking
 about
 uh
 7
 years
 of
 25
 plus%


revenue
 growth.
 Uh
 the
 last
 three
 have


been
 over
 30%.
 Uh
 we
 relentlessly
 invest


in
 the
 customer
 experience.
 So,
 we


continue
 to
 bring
 new
 products
 to
 our


customers
 that
 they're
 really
 enjoying


using
 and
 and
 that
 of
 course
 a
 a
 good


formula.
 And
 then
 last
 last
 point
 is
 we


save
 lives.
 Like
 we're
 a
 missiondriven


company
 uh
 and
 uh
 and
 having
 a
 real
 uh


impact
 in
 society
 today
 uh
 with
 our


tools
 to
 help
 public
 safety.
 So,
 when


you
 combine
 all
 those
 things,
 there
 just


aren't
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 like
 that
 in


the
 public
 markets
 today.
 And
 we're


really
 really
 proud
 that
 we've
 supported


our
 customers
 to
 the
 level
 where
 we're


seeing
 it
 grow
 in
 our
 financial
 results.


And
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 more
 about
 your


customers
 and
 this
 body
 workforce
 mini


in
 just
 a
 moment
 because
 I'd
 read


something
 about
 how
 maybe
 retailers


might
 be
 making
 use
 of
 it
 as
 well
 as


they
 deal
 with
 theft
 and
 and
 situations


at
 their
 outlets.
 But
 I
 got
 to
 ask
 you


about,
 you
 know,
 we
 were
 just
 talking


about
 the
 stock.
 It
 is
 down
 a
 lot
 since


early
 August.
 It
 hit
 a
 record
 uh
 back


then.
 Your
 CEO
 sold
 about
 $7
 million


shares
 last
 week.
 Your
 CFO
 sold
 about


3.6
 6
 million
 at
 the
 end
 of
 last
 month,


some
 to
 a
 much
 smaller
 amount
 in


mid-sepptember.
 Your
 CPO
 and
 CTO
 sold


nearly
 6
 million
 in
 mid
 August.
 And
 you


sold
 uh
 nearly
 12
 million
 worth
 of


shares
 in
 mid
 August,
 about
 11
 days


after
 earnings
 in
 in
 August.
 Insiders


selling,
 you
 know,
 where
 I'm
 going
 to


go.
 It's
 often
 something
 we
 will
 single


out
 as
 not
 a
 great
 sign.
 Should
 the


investing
 public
 be
 concerned?


>> Not
 at
 all.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 our
 stock


like
 over
 the
 last
 5
 years,
 uh
 a
 lot
 of


us
 have
 sold
 on
 the
 way
 up,
 you
 know,


it's
 our
 primary
 means
 of
 compensation.


Uh
 but
 we
 continue
 to
 have
 a
 lot


invested
 in
 the
 company
 and
 I',
 you


know,
 I'd
 chalk
 that
 up
 to
 uh
 you
 know,


just
 just
 life
 needs
 and
 and
 so
 forth
 as


opposed
 to
 not
 feeling
 confidence
 in
 the


company
 because
 we
 are
 extremely


extremely
 confident
 in
 what
 we're
 going


to
 do
 both
 for
 our
 customers
 and
 for
 our


investors.


>> All
 right,
 I
 just
 wanted
 to
 put
 that
 out


there.
 Hey,
 I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 this


body
 workforce
 mini.
 Um,
 my


understanding
 it's
 kind
 of
 the
 size
 and


weight
 of
 an
 AirPods
 Pro
 case.
 Comes


equipped
 with
 new
 communication
 AI
 and


HD
 um,
 video
 features.
 And
 I
 saw
 a


story,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 Business
 Insider,


that
 talked
 about
 some
 retailers,


including
 Walmart,
 have
 been
 testing
 out


the
 use
 of
 some
 police
 style
 body


cameras
 at
 some
 locations.
 They're


looking
 to
 improve
 worker
 safety.
 tell


us
 about
 the
 retail
 usage
 and
 if
 you're


seeing
 interest
 in
 demand.


>> Sure.
 Absolutely.
 When
 you
 ask
 uh
 retail


workers
 uh
 is
 violent
 crime
 in
 the


workspace
 on
 the
 rise,
 seven
 of
 10
 of


them
 will
 say
 absolutely
 yes.
 And
 we
 see


that
 combined
 with
 shrinkage
 in
 retail,


meaning
 the
 amount
 of
 inventory
 being


written
 down
 and
 lost
 going
 from
 1%
 to


3%.
 And
 we
 think
 body
 cameras
 are
 a
 big


part
 of
 the
 solution
 here.
 So
 just
 like


in
 public
 safety
 when
 a
 retail
 worker
 is


wearing
 body
 cameras,
 there's
 mutual


accountability
 on
 both
 ends
 of
 the
 lens


to
 make
 sure
 uh
 that
 that
 uh
 you
 know


issues
 or
 conflicts
 don't
 get
 uh


escalated
 further.
 So
 you
 see
 a
 drop
 in


abuse
 of
 workers,
 you
 see
 a
 drop
 in


shrinkage
 and
 when
 we
 can
 provide


outcomes
 like
 that
 to
 retailers,
 uh


they're
 certainly
 willing
 to
 pay
 pay
 for


that
 because
 it
 does
 drive
 uh
 a
 really


good
 ROI
 on
 their
 end.
 And
 that's
 what


we're
 seeing.
 you
 mentioned
 uh
 you
 know


the
 Walmart
 uh
 uh
 opportunity
 there.


We're
 seeing
 that
 across
 several
 large


retailers
 both
 in
 the
 US
 and
 and
 Canada


and
 we
 think
 that
 is
 a
 really
 really
 uh


exciting
 and
 growing
 space
 for
 our


company
 that
 will
 participate
 in
 for
 a


long
 time.
 How
 do
 you
 quantify
 that
 as


an
 addressable
 market?
 And
 also,
 are
 you


expecting
 every
 Walmart
 employee
 to
 wear


one
 or
 would
 it
 just
 be
 a
 handful
 that


would
 be
 interacting
 with
 customers,
 say


at
 an
 exit?


>> You
 know,
 I
 I
 think
 over
 time,
 no,
 no


matter
 who
 the
 retailer
 is,
 we
 do


believe
 there's
 a
 space
 uh
 on
 the


uniform
 for
 every
 retail
 worker
 on
 the


floor
 to
 be
 wearing
 them.
 Now,
 I
 don't


know
 that
 you'd
 be
 putting
 these
 on
 on


folks
 that
 are
 maybe
 in
 more
 desk
 jobs,


but
 certainly
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 retailers


themselves,
 we
 believe
 100%
 of
 retailer


uh
 retail
 workers
 uh
 will
 see
 a
 value
 in


wearing
 these.
 And
 so,
 uh
 very
 very


excited.
 In
 terms
 of
 the
 TAM,
 you
 know,


I
 I
 always
 say
 the
 way
 to
 think
 about


this
 is
 there's
 a
 million
 cops
 in
 public


safety,
 uh
 in
 the
 US,
 and
 we've
 built
 a


$60
 billion
 business
 uh
 in
 that
 space.


Uh
 Walmart
 alone
 has
 2.4
 4
 million


retail
 workers
 uh
 relative
 to
 a
 million


cops.
 And
 that's
 just
 one
 brand,
 of


course,
 a
 very
 large
 one,
 but
 one
 brand.


And
 so,
 uh
 the
 TAM
 is
 is
 uh


significantly
 larger.
 And
 uh
 just
 like


we
 did
 in
 public
 safety,
 we're
 investing


a
 lot,
 putting
 a
 lot
 behind
 uh
 making


all
 of
 these
 retailers
 more
 successful


uh
 and
 and
 saving
 them
 some
 money.
 So


very
 excited
 about
 what
 the
 space
 holds.
