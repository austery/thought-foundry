Do you want to have a couple of
questions as we're having an amazing
period of time?
Like I think nobody's seen before.
And we have tremendous stuff, as you
know, in Israel.
And now we're in a country where a
friend of mine is a very powerful leader
and my friend is right here.
The president
also the general.
You know,
times I call him usually I call him the
general, because he's both and he's good
at both.
And they've done a fantastic job and
they have very little crime, you know,
because they don't play games.
That's why they don't play games like we
do in the United States with governors
and have no idea what they're doing, but
they don't have good time.
I ask about driving.
They always don't even know what I'm
talking about.
So it's it's a great tribute to this
man.
He's done a fantastic job in bringing
this country together.
And the United States is with them all
the way.
They can walk all the way.
And it's an honor to be with you.
Sir, what will Egypt's role play in the
peace process here?
We played a very important role, and
they had a very important role with
Hamas.
The fact that the general was right here
was very instrumental because Hamas
respects this country and they respect
the leadership of Egypt.
So we had a you played a very important
role.
I appreciate it very much.
Thank you.
President Trump in Israel just now, you
were talking about a possible Iran peace
deal.
You said we are ready when you are.
Is that the ultimate goal with today's
signing to get by?
No, not Iran.
But but I think Iran will come along and
they've been battered and bruised and,
you know, they're there.
That they need some help.
They have big sanctions, as you know,
tremendous sanctions.
I'd love to take the sanctions off when
they're ready to talk, but they can't
really survive with those sanctions.
Those sanctions are very tough.
But at some point, they're going to say,
we want the sanctions off.
We're going to end up with basically I
think Iran is going to be fine.
I know so many Iranian people.
They're great people.
They're smart, great, great people,
engineers, lawyers, amateur academics.
But
the they took a big hit.
And frankly, if we didn't hit them with
the nuclear, I don't think you would
have been able to have this incredible
this this deal, this once in a lifetime
deal.
Nobody's ever seen anything like what's
happening today.
And countries have all come together,
all different countries.
Some like each other, some did, most
didn't.
And they've all come together.
Every country has come together.
And by the way, Iran did put out a
statement, you know, that they support
this deal very wholeheartedly.
So that was in itself something.
But no, I think they want to that's all
I do in my life.
I make deals and they want to make a
deal
rather than the way
that the living hostages have been
returned.
Can you please tell us what the next
steps are?
Well, they're going and looking for
bodies.
It's a pretty gruesome task.
And they're they know where numbers are.
As you know, I guess five or six are in
yet now.
But they're looking for bodies.
They know the areas and they search
bodies out and they're doing it in
conjunction with Israel.
And they'll they're going to be finding
quite a few of them.
President Trump, can you tell us when
phase two of the negotiations will
begin?
What started?
I mean, he started as far as we're
concerned, and phase prosperity.
And, you know, the phases are all a
little bit mixed in with each other and
start cleaning up.
If you look at Gaza.
There is a lot of cleanup.
That's why when I talked in my speech, I
talked about the debris.
I use the word debris.
That's debris times ten.
So we're going to they're going to
really do a job.
They have a lot of power.
In another room.
You have the wealthiest, some of the
wealthiest nations in the world.
All leaders, the big leaders, the here,
the mayors and the games and everybody.
And it's a very interesting group.
I guess we have like 35 countries, and
that's only because they were the 35.
Then we invited everybody that we
invited came.
So it's there's a lot of respect and I
think you'll see some tremendous
progress both in the Middle East.
This country is doing very well.
It has good leadership.
It's about leadership.
And it's really nice when you say how is
your prime situation?
And they, like, don't even know what
you're talking about.
What do you mean?
We don't have God because it he is
trying.
He puts it out very quickly.
Some people think that's not nice, but I
think it's great because people don't
want to be mugged and smashed and they
don't want to be stupid people.
They have a place that
is going very well.
We're very proud of it because we knew
each other from the beginning.
The first time I met it was in a hotel
and I was going to meet him and then
Hillary Clinton was following me.
I remember Hillary Clinton and he liked
me so much he never even got to see
Hillary.
I for about 2 seconds.
But he didn't really want to waste a lot
of time.
We knew what was going to happen, but
that was the first time we met and we
had a very good chemistry together and
it continues till today.
So I want to thank you all very much.
I appreciate the way you've covered the
This is really momentous.
I've never seen anything like it.
The level of love, the level of respect
for what it is.
And it's you know, it's it's peace in
the Middle East.
And everybody said it's not possible to
do and it's going to happen and it is
happening is before your very eyes.
And that's why it's become so
fascinating.
What would you have anything to say to?
Egypt's been a phenomenal participant, I
think.
Well, Steve and I will tell you the
critical role they played.
They can tell you themselves they hosted
the talks here and they're going to play
a very important role now in the follow
of the implementation of this, which is
really it's not simply about restoring
Gaza, it is about transforming the
region.
So we got an incredible partner, a long
alliance, very capable partner here, and
a tremendous collection of leaders.
This is clearly in my mind, I think, in
the mind of everyone in this room,
probably one of the most important days
for world peace in 50 years.
That's not an exaggeration.
Only 50, maybe 100
years since the end of World War Two.
Mr.
Wyckoff and Mr.
Kushner, I'm curious.
You've played such an important role in
the tactical negotiations here.
What will your role be going forward as
as a lot more has to be brought to the
table here?
Oh, the minute the minute we get into
the deal, Jared and I were already
working on the implementation side of
the deal.
So where we're dug in will be here quite
a bit, and that's at the direction of
the president.
That's probably going to be one of the
most important phases here.
Jared is remarkable to work with.
I talk about it all the time.
Of course, we both love working for the
president, so I would say it was like a
very honorable job.
Mr.
President, would you like to say
something?
Yes.
What do you think, then?
Unless I agree with
you that this
is what.
But it was.
What could have happened to that?
Ending this violence?
Well, first of all, relax and say I
welcome you to your job.
It's a great pleasure and honor to have
you with us here in the City of Peace
associate, also to extend
on behalf of all the and peace lovers
around the world.
I salute the appreciation and respect
of the president and his
accomplishments.
While I don't do that
for the good of the country,
we.
Obviously, I've been very confident that
Your Excellency is the only one who's
capable of bringing this about and bring
an end to this war.
What have you decided for countries to
do with the
little countries and like a couple other
island people?
I even said that very precisely during
my communication with Your Excellency,
that you are the only one who is able to
bring about peace and to achieve peace
in this
country.
I thank you for your support and I think
you just let me set up the road, set out
into the highway and what
we need.
That's a
lot of us who want to celebrate this
Olympics, Right?
So it's kind of sad that we're standing
looking over.
And what we need to do now is to fix the
ceasefire, make sure that it maintains
the state that we
can deliver all of the remains of the
bodies of the deceased to the families.
And this is very important to bring in
more humanitarian assistance into the
strip.
And we are working very closely on
following up the rest of the steps that
should be taken to make this a success.
Mr..
But it would be very great and you would
say thank you
is a good man, is a good man with we
have all the work.
Will he be on the Board of Peace, sir?
I'd like to have on the board.
I'd like to.
We may need an adjournment, but that's
okay.
I have no family
members who don't have a will.
As long as the president
can't do better.
The people of the Board of Peace.
I'll be there.
We've had many leaders want to be on the
board.
Actually, the Board of Peace is taking
on Steve.
I'd say a life of its own.
Do you want to discuss that?
What's happened in the last year left?
I think we have a long list.
If that's the case, to be on the list,
that's very nice.
It's better than the other way.
Usually it's the other way.
Nobody wants to be on the board, but
it's it's really taking on.
This whole thing has taken on a life
that's very different.
It's been it's been really great, a
great honour.
And and you people have done a fantastic
job.
I want to tell you that.
We appreciate it very much.
Firstly, thank you very much, everyone.
All right.
So
once again, I think
what I would add is, you know, I just
want to look forward to Your
Excellency's support and sponsorship
with us in the conference for the
reconstruction.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
All right.
All right, you guys.
