Speaking
 of
 legacy,
 it
 is
 40
 years
 for


Blackstone.
 It
 was
 founded
 by
 these
 two


visionaries.
 Pete
 Peterson,
 who
 passed


in
 2018,


and
 Steve,
 who
 many
 of
 you
 heard
 from


last
 night
 and
 had
 to
 go
 to
 the
 UK
 at


the
 request
 of
 President
 Trump
 and
 Prime


Minister
 Starmer.
 These
 guys
 had
 the


idea
 that
 they
 were
 going
 to
 build
 a


different
 kind
 of
 financial
 services


company
 dedicated
 to
 delivering
 for


customers.
 They
 started
 with
 just


$400,000.


And
 of
 course,
 that
 has
 become
 something


much
 larger.
 $225
 billion
 market
 cap
 and


$1.2
 trillion
 of
 assets
 under


management.
 The
 largest
 alternative


asset
 manager
 in
 the
 world.
 How
 did
 this


happen?
 Well,
 I'll
 just
 hit
 on
 a
 couple


things.
 Obviously,
 the
 most
 important,


our
 northstar,
 a
 relentless
 focus
 on


returns.
 These
 are
 all
 our
 major


strategies
 here
 since
 the
 first
 one
 in


corporate
 private
 equity
 in
 1987.
 These


are
 the
 net
 returns
 we've
 produced
 over


time
 through
 good
 times
 and
 bad
 times.


This
 is
 what
 it's
 all
 about.
 We
 have
 to


earn
 your
 trust
 each
 and
 every
 day.
 We


have
 to
 deliver
 for
 you.
 This
 is
 why
 we


spend
 so
 much
 time
 on
 our
 due
 diligence,


the
 rigor
 uh
 in
 our
 investment
 committee


process.
 It's
 why
 I
 spend
 my
 weekends


reading
 investment
 committee
 memos
 as
 do


many
 of
 my
 partners.
 This
 is
 what
 it's


all
 about.
 The
 second
 thing
 is
 the


entrepreneurial
 spirit
 of
 this
 place.


Steve
 really
 puts
 it
 into
 the
 DNA.
 This


idea
 that
 we
 can
 do
 more.
 We
 can
 do
 it


in
 more
 places,
 in
 more
 sectors.
 We


started
 with
 one
 office
 in
 the
 United


States.
 Today,
 of
 course,
 27
 offices


around
 the
 globe.
 We
 started
 with
 one


strategy,
 corporate,
 private
 equity.


Today
 we
 have
 more
 than
 80
 strategies


and
 we're
 constantly
 looking
 for
 new


places
 to
 deploy
 capital.
 Where
 are


their
 interesting
 areas
 to
 invest?
 We're


going
 to
 talk
 about
 a
 bunch
 of
 those


today.
 We're
 trying
 to
 look
 forward.
 How


can
 we
 continue
 to
 deliver
 for
 all
 of


you?


Third
 thing,
 the
 advantage
 of
 scale.
 I


often
 get
 asked,
 isn't
 being
 so
 big
 a


negative?
 And
 I
 would
 tell
 you
 that
 our


greatest
 advantage
 comes
 from
 our
 scale.


The
 idea
 that
 we
 have
 this
 enormous


portfolio
 of
 real
 estate
 and
 companies


and
 infrastructure
 and
 the
 insights
 we


get
 from
 that.
 If
 you
 think
 about


investing
 as
 pattern
 recognition,


connecting
 dots,
 we
 get
 more
 dots
 than


anybody
 around
 inflation
 and
 the


economy.
 We're
 going
 to
 share
 some
 of


that.
 And
 then
 of
 course
 around
 the
 big


mega
 trends
 that
 are
 driving
 the
 future.


And
 we
 look
 to
 this
 portfolio
 constantly


to
 think
 about
 how
 we
 can
 best
 deploy


capital.
 The
 other
 advantage
 I'd


mentioned
 on
 scale
 is
 our
 ability
 to
 do


very
 large
 transactions.
 So
 here
 you


have
 six
 deals
 we
 did
 in
 the
 last
 year


across
 the
 firm.
 Everything
 from
 data


centers
 in
 Asia
 to
 my
 favorite
 fast
 food


chain
 and
 Jersey
 Mike's.
 The
 commonality


across
 this
 is
 that
 we
 did
 not
 need
 to


call
 another
 sponsor.
 Because
 of
 the


capital
 you
 entrust
 us
 with
 and
 because


of
 co-investment,
 we're
 able
 to
 do
 these


transactions
 which
 is
 a
 huge
 competitive


advantage.
 And
 speaking
 of
 co-invest,
 we


know
 how
 important
 it
 is
 to
 you.
 We
 did


11
 billion
 in
 2024.
 In
 the
 first
 half
 of


the
 year,
 it
 was
 up
 threefold.
 We


recognize
 this
 is
 key
 to
 the
 people
 in


this
 room.
 We
 will
 continue
 to
 deliver


co-invest
 at
 scale.
 Final
 thing
 on


Blackstone,
 our
 commitment
 to
 culture.


This
 is
 an
 image
 of
 uh
 BXTV
 with
 me
 and


Stephen
 Vic.
 Every
 Monday
 we
 do
 an


internal
 Zoom
 call
 for
 all
 our


professionals
 around
 the
 globe.
 We
 talk


about
 what
 we
 see
 in
 markets,
 where
 are


interesting
 places
 to
 invest,
 funds


we're
 raising.
 We
 want
 everyone
 to
 know


what
 we're
 doing.
 We
 also
 have
 a
 photo


contest.
 We
 show
 people
 climbing


mountains
 and
 running
 marathons,
 having


babies,
 getting
 married.
 We
 understand


that
 ultimately
 our
 business
 is
 about


our
 people
 and
 what
 connects
 them
 is
 the


culture
 of
 this
 firm.
 And
 we're
 very


proud
 of
 what
 that
 has
 produced.
 It


leads
 to
 almost
 60,000
 young
 people


applying
 to
 work
 at
 Blackstone
 this
 year


and
 only
 138
 get
 jobs.
 I'm
 very
 lucky.
 I


got
 a
 job
 at
 Blackstone
 33
 years
 ago,
 I


would
 say.
 And
 then
 when
 people
 come


here,
 the
 nearly
 300
 partners
 we
 have


have
 stayed
 an
 average
 of
 12
 years
 now


today.
 And
 the
 people
 you're
 going to


hear
 from
 at
 this
 conference
 have
 been


at
 Blackstone
 an
 average
 of
 20
 years.
 So


chapter
 two,
 let's
 go
 to
 the
 economy
 and


the
 investment
 environment.
 How
 are
 we


seeing
 things?
 Well,
 the
 world
 is


obviously
 a
 tough
 place.
 The
 headlines,


if
 you
 read
 them
 every
 day,
 can
 be
 very


depressing.
 I
 asked
 Chad
 GPT
 to
 make


this.
 I
 will
 admit
 I
 put
 my
 picture
 in


here
 and
 I
 said
 make
 me
 look
 a
 little


younger.
 Um
 there
 you
 go.
 Tariffs,
 we


know
 the
 uncertainty
 it
 created
 and


continues
 to
 create.
 Hopefully
 some
 of


that's
 going
 to
 settle
 fairly
 soon.


We've
 got
 some
 hot
 geopolitical


conflicts
 which
 create
 risk.
 Hopefully


those
 will
 settle
 over
 the
 next
 year.


Inflation
 and
 rates
 we'll
 talk
 about.


But
 people
 are
 feeling
 pretty
 cautious


in
 the
 investment
 world
 given
 some
 of


this.
 We
 would
 argue,
 however,
 that
 yes,


there
 is
 some
 rain,
 there's
 clouds,
 but


there
 are
 also
 reasons
 for
 optimism.
 And


what
 I'm
 going
 to
 spend
 time
 today
 is


talking
 a
 bit
 about
 why
 it's
 okay
 to
 see


the
 glass
 maybe
 a
 little
 more
 half
 full


while
 still
 recognizing
 some
 of
 these


risks.


Let's
 start
 with
 the
 economy.


Clearly,
 Europe
 is
 slow.
 In
 the
 US,


consumers,
 particularly
 lower-end


consumers,
 face
 real
 challenges.
 But


this
 is
 our
 private
 equity
 portfolio.
 In


the
 second
 quarter,
 revenue
 growth
 was


remarkably
 strong
 at
 nearly
 8%.
 And
 when


you
 look
 at
 our
 borrowers,


non-investment
 grade
 borrowers,
 several


thousand
 of
 them,
 a
 default
 rate
 of
 just


0.5%.


I
 think
 this
 will
 go
 up
 a
 bit,
 but
 this


is
 overall
 pretty
 good
 picture.


Also,
 the
 margin
 side
 of
 the
 equation
 at


our
 companies,
 we're
 up
 170
 basis
 points


in
 the
 second
 quarter.
 When
 you
 have


rising
 sales,
 rising
 margins,
 that
 is


not
 a
 formula
 for
 a
 recession.


Third
 thing,
 inflation.


Inflation
 is
 cooling
 around
 the
 globe.


Everyone
 talks
 about
 sticky
 inflation,


but
 our
 data
 tends
 to
 show
 otherwise.


Now,
 goods
 inflation
 in
 the
 US,
 as
 the


parenthetical
 says,
 will
 be
 sticky,
 will


be
 higher
 because
 of
 the
 tariffs.
 But
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 headline
 CPI
 that
 came


out
 last
 week,
 embedded
 in
 it
 is
 rental


housing
 costs
 at
 3.6%.


That
 is
 very
 different
 than
 what
 we
 see


as
 the
 largest
 owner
 of
 rental
 housing


in
 the
 United
 States.
 By
 the
 way,
 this


is
 the
 biggest
 category,
 35%
 of
 CPI.
 We


would
 say
 that
 BX
 derived
 shelter
 costs


from
 our
 portfolio
 or
 a
 little
 over
 2%,


which
 puts
 CPI
 reality
 at
 2.4%.
 much


closer
 to
 the
 Fed's
 target.


Now,
 it's
 not
 just
 rental
 housing
 costs.


It's
 also
 the
 labor
 market.
 So,
 every


quarter
 we
 do
 a
 survey.
 We
 say
 to
 our


CEOs,
 "What
 are
 the
 things
 that
 are


keeping
 you
 up
 at
 night?
 Is
 it
 tariffs,


technology?"
 And
 if
 you
 went
 back
 to
 Q1


of
 22,
 the
 number
 one
 thing
 they
 said


was
 how
 hard
 it
 was
 to
 hire
 people.
 When


we
 asked
 that
 same
 question
 last


quarter,
 that
 had
 dropped
 to
 number


nine.
 So
 something
 is
 happening
 here
 in


the
 labor
 market
 and
 we
 see
 it
 now
 in


our
 numbers.
 I
 would
 tell
 you
 our


numbers
 are
 often
 6
 to
 12
 months
 ahead


of
 what
 you
 see
 in
 the
 government
 data.


But
 these
 are
 heads
 of
 uh
 human


resources
 at
 our
 US
 companies.
 4.6%


wage
 growth
 a
 year
 ago
 which
 has
 dropped


below
 3%
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 the


postcoid
 period.
 If
 I
 was
 a
 Fed


governor,
 this
 is
 very
 encouraging
 when


you
 think
 about
 inflation.


Now
 also


cost
 of
 capital
 so
 important
 and
 as


inflation
 comes
 down
 so
 should
 rates


in
 Canada
 and
 Europe
 they've
 obviously


moved
 much
 quicker
 in
 the
 US
 we
 were
 on


the
 path
 down
 the
 Fed
 paused
 given


liberation
 day
 wanted
 to
 see
 the
 impact


of
 tariffs
 I
 think
 we
 all
 know
 at
 2
 p.m.


This
 number
 is
 going
 to
 go
 down
 by
 25


basis
 points.
 But
 we
 would
 argue
 if


these
 inflation
 trends
 continue,
 we'll


continue
 to
 see
 costs
 of
 capital
 come


down.
 That's
 good
 for
 businesses.
 It's


good
 for
 consumers.
 And
 it's
 good
 for
 us


as
 investors
 because
 the
 present
 value


of
 cash
 flows
 are
 worth
 more.


But
 it's
 not
 just
 base
 rates
 that
 are


coming
 down.
 Here
 we
 have
 high
 yield


spreads.
 Back
 in
 22
 when
 things
 looked


scariest,
 high
 yield
 spreads
 were
 nearly


600
 over.
 They've
 come
 down
 basically
 in


half
 to
 290
 over.
 This
 of
 course
 drives


down
 borrowing
 costs
 for
 companies
 and


is
 very
 good
 for
 the
 transaction


environment.


And
 again,
 it's
 not
 just
 about
 debt,


it's
 about
 the
 equity
 market.
 In
 2021,


the
 IPO
 market
 in
 the
 US
 was
 booming


nearly
 $60
 billion.
 By
 22,
 it
 was
 shut


off.
 It's
 beginning
 to
 climb
 out.
 And
 at


Blackstone,
 we've
 done
 three
 IPOs
 in
 the


last
 couple
 months.
 Last
 week,
 we
 did


our
 first
 US
 IPO
 since
 2021.
 I
 would


expect
 you'll
 see
 more.
 And
 across
 the


industry,
 this
 should
 help
 with
 the
 DPI


challenge
 that
 so
 many
 of
 you
 have
 been


facing.


But
 what
 is
 the
 main
 reason?
 I'm


enthusiastic.
 We're
 enthusiastic.


What
 is
 the
 main
 thing?
 It
 is
 AI.


This
 is
 the
 big
 thing
 and
 why
 is
 it
 the


big
 thing?
 Because
 it's
 starting
 with


this
 massive
 investment
 boom
 which
 we'll


talk
 about
 which
 provides
 the
 foundation


for
 the
 technology
 and
 then
 the
 AI


itself
 which
 we
 believe
 is
 going
 to


create
 an
 enormous
 productivity
 boom.


That's
 what's
 coming.


And
 shouldn't
 just
 take
 my
 word
 for
 it.


These
 are
 the
 leaders
 of
 the
 biggest


tech
 companies
 in
 the
 world.
 My
 personal


favorite
 comes
 from
 Jensen
 who
 was
 our


speaker
 last
 year
 who
 said
 a
 new


industrial
 revolution
 has
 started
 and
 we


certainly
 subscribed
 to
 that.
 So
 what


was
 the
 Sputnik
 moment
 that
 got
 this


started?
 Obviously
 it
 was
 the
 launch
 of


Chat
 GPT.


In
 less
 than
 two
 years
 it
 got
 to
 700


million
 customers,
 the
 fast
 fastest
 of


any
 consumer
 product
 in
 history.


Now
 have
 we
 ever
 experienced
 anything


like
 this
 before
 where
 the
 world
 changed


dramatically?
 I
 don't
 think
 at
 this


scale
 but
 we
 do
 have
 something
 that
 is
 a


bit
 of
 precedence.
 Go
 back
 to
 1989
 94
 I


was
 in
 college
 and
 then
 a
 couple
 years


working.
 If
 you
 go
 back
 then


productivity
 cumulatively
 over
 those


five
 years
 was
 growing
 just
 4%
 less
 than


1%
 a
 year.
 The
 stock
 market
 did
 okay,


grew
 9
 a.5%
 a
 year,
 but
 the
 Fed
 had
 cut


rates
 by
 300
 basis
 points
 during
 that


point.
 But
 then
 something
 very
 powerful


happened.


[Music]


I
 love
 that.
 Uh
 you
 guys
 remember


dialing
 up
 AOL,
 the
 first
 internet


service
 provider,
 getting
 to
 Netscape,


the
 main
 browser
 at
 the
 time.
 And


dramatic
 things
 happened
 in
 the
 second


half
 of
 that
 decade.
 You
 saw
 a
 threefold


increase
 in
 productivity
 to
 11%
 here.


And
 you
 saw
 the
 stock
 market
 grow


fivefold,
 251%.


I
 am
 not
 advocating
 that's
 what's
 coming


in
 the
 stock
 market.
 multiples
 today
 are


much
 higher
 than
 they
 were
 in
 1994.
 But


it
 gives
 you
 a
 sense
 of
 the
 power
 of
 a


productivity
 boom
 and
 what
 it
 can
 mean


for
 companies
 and
 values
 and
 growth.
 Now


things
 did
 get
 a
 little
 ugly
 at
 the
 end


as
 you
 remember
 in
 2000
 pets.com
 some


business
 models
 that
 didn't
 make
 sense.


And
 this
 is
 the
 big
 risk.
 The
 big
 risk


is
 as
 this
 technology
 gets
 takes
 hold,


as
 we
 all
 get
 more
 enthusiastic,


excesses
 will
 build
 up
 and
 we've
 got
 to


be
 thinking
 about
 those
 as
 we're


deploying
 capital.


Now,
 the
 question
 today
 is,
 is
 AI


beginning
 to
 have
 an
 impact?
 And
 this


study
 just
 came
 out
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago


from
 Stanford,
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 starting


to
 show
 the
 early
 impact
 of
 AI.
 It


starts
 here
 with
 two,
 I'll
 call
 it,
 AI


unaffected
 sectors.
 stock
 clerks
 and


health
 aids.
 And
 it
 has
 cohorts
 early


20s
 and
 people
 in
 their
 40s.
 And
 if
 you


look
 in
 stock
 clerks,
 basically
 they're


both
 their
 growth
 in
 employment
 is


roughly
 the
 same.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 in


health
 aids,
 actually
 there's
 more


hiring
 of
 young
 people
 than
 people
 who


are
 more
 experienced.
 So
 AI
 here,
 no


impact.
 But
 now
 let's
 look
 at
 a
 couple


other
 sectors.
 Software
 developers.


Look
 what's
 happening
 to
 that
 orange


line
 for
 22
 to
 25
 year olds.
 Something


dramatic.
 A
 clawed
 code
 effect.
 Early


programmers
 are
 being
 displaced,
 it


appears.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 the
 same
 story


with
 customer
 service
 agents.
 As
 AI
 gets


better
 answering
 phones,
 answering


questions,
 more
 and
 more
 technology


taking
 over
 for
 people.
 It
 feels
 like
 it


is
 very
 early
 days
 here.
 So,
 how
 is
 this


impacting
 us
 here
 at
 Blackstone?
 Well,


we
 just
 did
 a
 commercial
 called
 Eureka


about
 the
 gold
 rush
 in
 San
 Francisco
 or


in
 Northern
 California
 in
 1849.
 It's


about
 a
 couple
 of
 clever
 clever
 gold


miners
 who
 decide
 instead
 of
 looking
 for


gold,
 they're
 going to
 sell
 picks
 and


shovels.
 Of
 course,
 it's
 a
 metaphor


about
 digital
 and
 energy
 infrastructure.


Let's
 take
 a
 look.


We
 finally
 made
 it.
 Now,
 let's
 go
 get


that
 gold.


Anyway,
 it's
 a
 little
 cut
 of
 that.
 I


want
 to
 show
 you
 the
 second
 version
 we


have
 of
 this.


[Music]


We
 finally
 made
 it.


Let's
 go
 get
 that
 gold.


Now,
 what's
 the
 difference
 between
 these


two
 ads?
 This
 one
 was
 filmed
 outside
 of


Vancouver.
 We
 flew
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 up,


hotel
 rooms,
 cast
 and
 crew,
 all
 of
 those


things.
 Took
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 to
 make.
 film


editing.
 It
 cost
 a
 million
 dollars
 to


make.
 Good
 ad.
 The
 one
 on
 the
 left
 is


not
 quite
 as
 good
 yet.
 It
 was
 made
 on


the
 eighth
 floor
 here
 with
 two
 guys
 in
 a


couple
 hours.
 And
 you
 think
 about
 the


cost
 of
 this,


a
 lot
 lot
 less.


And
 you
 think
 about
 how
 this
 will
 work


its
 way
 through
 the
 economy
 and


businesses,
 it's
 pretty
 extraordinary.


So,
 how
 do
 we
 invest
 around
 this


generational
 change?
 That
 is
 the
 key


question.
 Well,
 I
 think
 it's
 really


important
 to
 think
 about
 disruption
 and


why
 you've
 got
 to
 be
 proactive.
 And
 I'm


starting
 here
 with
 the
 New
 York
 City


taxi
 medallion,
 which
 may
 be
 the
 best


asset
 class
 over
 66-year
 period
 in


history.
 Because
 if
 you
 had
 a


grandparent
 who
 decided
 in
 1947
 to
 buy


one
 at
 $2500,


it
 would
 grow
 to
 be
 worth
 $1.2
 million.


Plus,
 you
 would
 have
 gotten
 a
 bunch
 of


cash
 flow.
 And
 this
 is
 unleveraged.


Extraordinary.
 And
 if
 you
 looked
 at
 any


time
 in
 your
 investment
 committee
 memo,


you'd
 say
 this
 is
 the
 asset
 to
 buy.
 But


of
 course,
 technology
 changed.
 Uber


andyft
 came
 along
 and
 in
 a
 matter
 of


couple
 years,
 you
 lost
 82%
 of
 your


value.
 And
 these
 are
 the
 sort
 of
 things


that
 are
 keeping
 us
 up
 at
 night.
 The


kind
 of
 change
 that
 could
 be
 ahead
 for
 a


number
 of
 businesses.
 Now,
 the
 good
 news


is
 there
 are
 plenty
 of
 things
 that
 will


be
 less
 impacted.


physical
 things
 like
 the
 airport
 in


Rome,
 Stifin
 Town,
 the
 massive
 apartment


complex
 we
 own
 in
 New
 York
 City,
 Seven


Brew,
 the
 fastest
 growing
 coffee
 chain


in
 the
 US.
 These
 things
 will
 be
 much


less
 impacted,
 but
 there'll
 be
 plenty
 of


businesses
 that'll
 face
 major


challenges.
 So,
 of
 course,
 as
 investors,


how
 should
 we
 play
 this?
 Well,
 it
 starts


with
 the
 picks
 and
 shovels
 with
 things


like
 chips
 and
 data
 centers
 and
 power
 at


massive
 scale.
 This
 is
 what
 you
 need
 to


make
 this
 AI
 a
 reality.
 We
 have
 really


focused
 on
 the
 right
 two
 circles
 here.


And
 what's
 happening
 in
 this
 world?


Well,
 capback
 spend
 in
 this
 world
 is
 up


sixfold
 with
 just
 four
 companies.


Microsoft,
 Meta,
 Google,
 Amazon
 to
 $364


billion.
 To
 put
 that
 into
 context,
 that


is
 bigger
 than
 the
 budget
 of
 NASA,
 the


Department
 of
 Energy,
 and
 the
 Department


of
 State.
 It's
 equal
 to
 1%
 of
 the
 GDP
 of


the
 United
 States.
 This
 doesn't
 include


Oracle,
 which
 is
 now
 joining
 the
 party


in
 a
 big
 way.
 These
 numbers
 are
 going
 to


be
 even
 bigger
 next
 year.
 The
 scale
 of


this
 is
 hard
 to
 fathom.


Next
 up,
 what
 how
 is
 the
 US?
 How
 are
 we


playing
 this
 in
 the
 US
 and
 around
 the


world?
 With
 QTS,
 we
 have
 seen
 a
 tenfold


increase
 in
 this
 company
 that
 we
 bought


in
 2021.


It's
 grown
 from
 a10
 billion
 company
 to
 a


$70
 billion
 company.
 Pretty


extraordinary.


It's
 not
 just
 data
 centers,
 of
 course,


it's
 power.
 I
 stole
 this
 graph
 from
 Shan


Climac.
 Over
 25
 years,
 power
 demand
 in


the
 US
 was
 basically
 flat.
 Now
 it's


projected
 to
 be
 up
 40%.


Why?
 Data
 centers,
 re-industrialization,


autonomous
 vehicles,
 robots.
 My
 guess
 is


this
 curve
 will
 be
 even
 steeper.


We
 believe
 this
 is
 so
 powerful.
 We
 go


back
 to
 the
 iconic
 1967
 film,
 The


Graduate.
 You
 may
 remember
 this.
 This
 is


Benjamin
 Bradock
 aka
 Dustin
 Hoffman


getting
 some
 advice
 from
 Mr.
 Maguire.


I
 just
 want
 to
 say
 one
 word
 to
 you.


Just
 one
 word.


Yes,
 sir.


Are
 you
 listening?


Yes.
 Are
 you
 power?


Okay.
 I
 think
 you
 know
 he
 didn't
 say


power,
 he
 said
 plastics.
 But
 if
 you
 have


young
 college
 graduates,
 I
 would
 tell


them
 power
 is
 the
 way
 to
 go.


How
 are
 we
 playing
 this
 at
 Blackstone?


Well,
 across
 the
 entire
 spectrum,
 data


centers
 in
 the
 US,
 Europe,
 and
 Asia,
 all


sorts
 of
 infrastructure
 around
 that.


We've
 given
 billions
 of
 dollars
 to


companies
 like
 Cororeweave,
 renewable


energy,
 generation
 and
 storage,


transmission,
 utilities,
 one
 of
 the
 most


boring
 businesses
 of
 all
 time,
 is
 now
 a


growth
 sector,
 and
 electrical
 equipment.


David
 Foley
 will
 talk
 about
 this.
 As
 you


build
 out
 the
 grid,
 lots
 of
 companies


are
 going
 to
 need
 to
 grow
 and
 invest.


Same
 thing
 with
 utility
 services.
 Lots


of
 ways
 to
 play
 picks
 and
 shovels.
 The


one
 other
 area
 that
 I
 want
 to
 stop
 on


for
 a
 sec
 is
 what
 I'll
 call
 rules-based


businesses.
 The
 marbles
 come
 down
 or


they
 white,
 orange,
 gray,
 you
 name
 it.


There's
 lots
 of
 opportunities
 with
 these


type
 of
 companies.
 What
 do
 I
 mean
 by


that?
 healthc
 care
 claims
 processing
 the


technology
 bringing
 AI
 to
 a
 company
 like


AGS
 health
 that
 we
 re
 recently
 acquired


same
 story
 with
 accounting
 the
 ultimate


rules-based
 business
 Citroen


Coopermanman
 you
 can
 take
 these
 legacy


businesses
 and
 transform
 them
 and
 then


invest
 in
 some
 of
 the
 application


software
 as
 well
 we
 invested
 in
 a


company
 called
 normai
 which
 is
 going
 to


make
 marketing
 compliance
 so
 much
 more


efficient
 more
 and
 more
 of
 our
 investing


is
 going
 to
 be
 guided
 in
 areas
 like


this.
 Chapter
 4,
 the
 outlook
 for


alternatives.


Well,
 you
 guys
 all
 know
 that
 this
 is
 a


business
 that
 has
 grown
 a
 ton.
 It
 was
 $3


trillion
 in
 2010.
 It's
 $13
 trillion


today.
 And
 of
 course,
 the
 question,
 why


have
 they
 grown?
 Why
 do
 alternatives


continue
 to
 grow?
 Well,
 it
 goes
 back
 to


the
 Northstar
 from
 the
 beginning.
 It's


all
 about
 returns.
 These
 are
 endowments


and
 foundations
 over
 the
 last
 decade
 in


the
 US.
 Those
 who
 are
 less
 than
 10%


allocated
 to
 alternatives
 underperform


those
 more
 than
 30%
 allocated
 by
 270


basis
 points
 a
 year.
 So
 much
 of
 this
 has


happened
 because
 of
 the
 strength
 of


private
 equity,
 the
 ability
 to
 pick
 the


right
 management
 teams,
 incentivize


them,
 add
 value
 to
 companies,
 optimize


capital
 structures.
 This
 has
 been
 the


key.
 But
 I
 often
 get
 the
 question,
 why


is
 private
 credit
 having
 the
 same


dynamic?
 Why
 are
 more
 people
 can't
 banks


have
 a
 lower
 cost
 of
 capital?
 And
 here


what
 I'd
 say
 is
 let's
 go
 to
 the
 farmer.


The
 farmer
 starts
 with
 his
 product,
 his


corn
 and
 his
 barn,
 sells
 it
 to
 a


distributor
 who
 sells
 it
 to
 the


supermarket,
 finally
 makes
 its
 way
 to


our
 table.


This
 is
 very
 similar
 in
 public
 credit,


particularly
 in
 assetbased
 credit,
 where


a
 borrower
 goes
 to
 a
 bank
 who
 then
 does


a
 securization
 or
 CLO
 and
 ultimately
 it


makes
 it
 to
 your
 portfolio
 with
 lots
 of


economics
 gone.
 What
 is
 private
 credit


all
 about?
 Private
 credit
 is
 about
 you


having
 privity
 basically
 with
 the


borrower,
 with
 our
 help.
 It
 is


farm-to-table


and
 there's
 no
 surprise
 why
 we
 have


generated
 almost
 200
 basis
 points
 of


incremental
 spread
 in
 private
 investment


grade
 credit
 over
 the
 last
 18
 months


with
 Gil
 and
 his
 team.
 So
 even
 as
 rates


and
 spreads
 tighten
 that
 gap
 we
 think


will
 continue
 to
 persist
 there'll


definitely
 be
 a
 gap
 be
 because
 of
 this


cost
 differential.
 The
 other
 reason
 why


private
 credit
 is
 going
 to
 grow
 a
 lot
 is


because
 it's
 moving
 beyond
 its
 roots


from
 direct
 lending
 from
 non-investment


grade
 corporate
 credit
 to
 the
 real


economy
 to
 aviation,
 credit
 cards,
 nav


lending,
 digital
 and
 energy


infrastructure.
 This
 is
 an
 enormous


market
 where
 private
 credit
 will
 again


have
 a
 meaningful
 competitive
 advantage


and
 grow
 quite
 significantly.


Now,
 another
 question
 I
 get
 is


alternatives
 have
 grown
 so
 much,
 isn't


there
 a
 risk
 that
 it's
 just
 too
 big?


Well,
 I
 would
 point
 out
 at
 13
 trillion


dollars
 today,
 the
 entire
 industry
 is


equal
 to
 four
 public
 companies
 in
 the


United
 States.
 And
 when
 you
 think
 about


the
 aggregate
 market
 that
 we
 can
 go


after,
 public
 equities,
 corporate
 and


asset
 back
 credit,
 commercial,


residential,
 real
 estate,


infrastructure,
 it
 is
 a
 very
 big
 $300


trillion
 world.
 So,
 I
 still
 think


there's
 plenty
 of
 room
 for
 this
 space
 to


grow.


One
 other
 area
 that's
 been
 getting
 a
 lot


of
 focus,
 we've
 been
 investing
 in
 the


wealth
 business
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 Now,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 talk
 about
 401k.
 What's


happening
 here?
 How's
 this
 going
 to


affect
 things?
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the


defined
 benefits
 world,
 the
 pension


plans
 many
 of
 you
 work
 at
 uh
 in
 the
 US,


it's
 a
 12
 trillion
 industry,
 about


one-third
 allocated
 to
 privates.
 If
 you


look
 at
 defined
 contribution
 plans,


which
 are
 also
 12
 trillion
 and
 growing


faster
 because
 obviously
 there
 are
 fewer


defined
 benefit
 plans
 these
 days,
 it's


only
 1%.
 So
 yes,
 our
 expectation
 is
 this


will
 grow,
 but
 it's
 definitely
 going
 to


take
 time.
 It's
 not
 going
 to
 happen


overnight.
 And
 I
 would
 just
 point
 out
 we


have
 seen
 transformations.
 We've
 seen


evolutions
 of
 capital
 before
 in
 our


industry.
 If
 you
 went
 back
 to
 BCP1
 in


1987,
 our
 first
 private
 equity
 fund,
 85%


of
 the
 capital
 came
 from
 insurance


companies,
 corporate
 pensions,
 and


banks.
 By
 the
 time
 we
 got
 to
 the
 21


billion
 BCP9
 here
 in
 2025,
 that
 number


had
 dropped
 to
 16%.


Pension
 plans
 and
 sovereign
 wealth
 funds


emerged.
 I
 do
 not
 think
 we're
 going
 to


have
 this
 kind
 of
 change
 in
 the
 sources


of
 our
 capital,
 but
 it
 just
 speaks
 to


the
 fact
 as
 alternatives
 grow,
 there
 are


new
 sources
 of
 capital
 that
 emerge
 and


there
 are
 plenty
 of
 things
 we
 believe
 to


invest
 in.


Okay,
 what
 are
 some
 good
 places
 to


invest
 in?
 We're
 going
 to
 talk
 about


this
 much
 of
 the
 day
 today.
 The
 first


stop
 I've
 got
 is
 commercial
 real
 estate.


It's
 been
 three
 and
 a
 half
 very
 tough


years
 for
 commercial
 real
 estate.
 But


now
 this
 good
 dynamic
 has
 taken
 over


which
 is
 new
 supply
 has
 declined
 by


nearly
 70%
 in
 this
 case
 in
 US
 logistics


but
 it's
 really
 happening
 around
 the


world.
 Cost
 of
 capital
 is
 coming
 down


assets
 have
 been
 repriced.
 This
 is
 the


time
 you
 want
 to
 be
 an
 investor
 in


commercial
 real
 estate.


Next
 stop
 secondaries.
 another
 industry


that
 has
 grown
 a
 ton
 from
 $23
 billion
 to


$200
 billion
 over
 the
 last
 15
 years.


Again,
 the
 concern,
 has
 this
 gotten
 too


big?
 But
 I
 would
 point
 out
 it's
 just


1.5%
 of
 outstanding
 AUM
 that
 is
 trading


hands.
 That
 compares
 to
 100%
 of
 the


stock
 market
 by
 value
 that
 trades
 hands.


That's
 why
 we
 believe
 the
 discounts
 and


secondaries
 will
 continue
 to
 persist.


Third
 stop
 leaving
 the
 United
 States


here,
 India.
 This
 is
 the
 G10.
 Clearly


the
 fastest
 growing
 country.
 There's


been
 some
 obviously
 tension


geopolitically
 recently.
 But
 this
 is
 a


country
 that
 is
 investing
 massively
 in


physical
 infrastructure,
 legal,
 capital


markets,
 infrastructure.
 There
 is
 a


rising
 middle
 class
 here.
 This
 is
 a


place
 we
 particularly
 like.


And
 it's
 not
 just
 India
 in
 Asia.
 It's


Japan.
 But
 the
 story
 in
 Japan
 is
 not


about
 growth.
 It's
 a
 story
 about
 trap


value.
 It's
 about
 activism
 showing
 up


here
 in
 a
 big
 way.
 The
 government


embracing
 return
 on
 capital,
 investment


over
 savings.
 We
 bought
 in
 Tokyo
 a
 super


luxury
 real
 estate
 complex
 that
 was


owned
 by
 a
 railroad
 company,
 a
 $2.6


billion
 complex.
 There
 are
 lots
 of


assets
 like
 that
 that
 our
 private
 equity


and
 real
 estate
 businesses
 hope
 to
 take


advantage
 of
 in
 the
 coming
 years.
 Some


other
 interesting
 areas
 to
 quickly
 hit


on
 regional
 banks.
 There
 are
 in
 the


United
 States


more
 than
 4,000
 banks
 now
 with
 a
 more


favorable
 regulatory
 environment.
 We


believe
 we'll
 see
 more
 consolidation
 in


that
 space.
 Lots
 of
 private
 credit


opportunities.
 We've
 been
 buying
 a
 lot


of
 real
 estate
 debt
 from
 regional
 banks.


Second
 spot,
 life
 sciences.
 Why
 is
 this


exciting?
 Well,
 AI
 is
 going
 to


accelerate
 innovation,
 but
 trials,
 phase


three
 trials
 cost
 tons
 and
 tons
 of


money.
 The
 big
 pharma
 companies,
 the


small
 life
 science
 companies,
 they
 don't


have
 the
 capital,
 and
 they're
 just
 not


that
 many
 people
 with
 the
 expertise.


You'll
 hear
 about
 this
 from
 Nick
 today.


Third
 area
 that
 I
 think
 is
 really


interesting,
 providing
 capital
 to


reinsurers.
 There's
 $800
 billion
 of


money
 in
 the
 reinsurance
 industry.
 I


think
 the
 same
 kind
 of
 opportunity
 that


exists
 in
 private
 credit
 bringing
 your


capital
 directly
 to
 insurers
 and
 giving


you
 higher
 returns
 on
 an
 uncorrelated


basis.
 Our
 TAC
 ops
 team's
 done
 an


amazing
 job
 here.


And
 finally,
 absolute
 return
 strategies.


as
 base
 rates
 come
 down.
 Places
 where


you
 can
 get
 attractive
 returns,
 lower


downside
 risk,
 things
 like
 macro
 and


quant
 very
 helpful
 in
 the
 context
 of


your
 overall
 portfolio
 to
 provide


returns
 and
 balanced.


Okay,
 I've
 talked
 about
 a
 lot
 of
 very


positive
 things,
 but
 we
 are
 investors


and
 there
 are
 real
 risks
 in
 the
 world.


So,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 hit
 those
 quickly.


First
 off,


AI
 valuations.
 I
 mentioned
 it
 earlier,


but
 there
 is
 no
 question
 that
 when
 you


get
 this
 kind
 of
 excitement,
 you're


going
 to
 get
 accesses.
 People
 are


focused
 on
 this.
 We're
 focused
 on
 this.


Will
 people
 start
 to
 speculatively
 build


data
 centers?
 Today
 they're
 leased.
 Will


they
 speculatively
 build
 them?
 Will
 it


start
 to
 create
 bubbles?
 We've
 got
 to


keep
 our
 eyes
 on
 this.
 Second
 thing,


excessive
 government
 debt.
 We're
 running


deficits
 of
 four
 to
 6%
 in
 major


economies
 around
 the
 world.
 That
 could


lead,
 of
 course,
 to
 higher
 long-end


rates.
 That
 could
 lead
 to
 lower


multiples.
 We're
 very
 focused
 on
 the


exit
 multiples,
 exit
 cap
 rates.
 We're


assuming


Europe
 much
 less
 exposure
 to
 tech,
 more


regulatory
 issues,
 immigration


challenges.
 Will
 we
 get
 far-left,


far-right
 governments
 that
 will
 impact


Europe?
 Something
 we're
 obviously


keeping
 our
 eyes
 on.
 US
 and
 China,
 the


two
 biggest
 economies
 in
 the
 world.
 I


think
 we
 have
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to
 coexist.


It's
 good
 to
 see
 there
 are
 talks
 going


on
 now
 have
 been
 in
 Europe
 that


President
 Xi
 and
 President
 Trump
 will


meet.
 But
 again,
 something
 worth
 keeping


our
 eyes
 on.
 And
 finally,
 the
 thing
 that


keeps
 us
 up
 at
 night
 the
 most,


underestimating
 technological


disruption.
 That
 obviously
 is
 enormously


important.
 We
 think
 about
 this
 all
 the


time.
 We've
 now
 added
 to
 our
 investment


committee
 memos
 that
 in
 the
 first
 two


pages
 of
 the
 memo,
 you've
 got
 to
 have
 a


paragraph
 on
 the
 AI
 risk
 of
 this


investment,
 not
 just
 in
 our
 equity


investments,
 but
 in
 our
 debt


investments.
 And
 we're
 going
 back


through
 our
 portfolios
 in
 each
 business


unit
 thinking
 about
 what
 are
 the
 risks.


We
 don't
 want
 to
 own
 those
 taxi


medallions.


So,
 I
 will
 close
 with
 where
 I
 began,
 the


north
 star
 here.
 Thanks
 to
 the
 tech
 team


for
 this.
 Um,
 we
 continue
 to
