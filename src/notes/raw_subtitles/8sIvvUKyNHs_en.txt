When you think about overall health,
too.
To what extent is screen time a part of
that conversation?
Well, thank you guys so much for having
me.
And health and screentime are really
connected.
When we think about mental health care
and physical health care as a whole
child approach.
And so when it comes to social media and
screen time, we are concerned about the
connections with mood, depression,
anxiety, body image experiences and
bullying or harassment.
And then on the physical side of things.
Concerns about sleep, impacts on
physical activity and getting things
done during your day.
So what's the right conversation to have
with parents?
I think about this a lot and I you know,
we were kind of strict with our
daughter.
She's 22 now, but it was a different
world then.
Yeah, it's amazing to write that many
years ago.
Yeah, but having said that, increasingly
as she got older, I mean, everything,
even schoolwork and assignments and
interaction with teachers, it all
happened digitally.
And so she had to be on those platforms.
But how do we in a, you know, society I
love what this weekend essay by
Catherine Paige Jeffrey about you know
learning how to have the right digital
conversation with your family.
How do you advise parents on all of
this?
So that's the number one thing I really
love the idea of like we're not going to
be able to create the childhoods of the
past.
We live in a digital world, so the focus
can't really be on limiting or having
kids not use screens is what you're
doing, the content, how you're viewing
it, how can you be critical?
And so I teach families to really just
ask some thoughtful questions to their
kids about like, what are you looking
at?
How does it make you feel?
Do you feel happier, more stress?
And who who's made this content?
What are they trying to sell you?
What does it do to put your attention
here?
So those sort of thoughtful pieces of
kind of how is it impacting me?
How how is this connected to my mood and
why?
As well as thinking about what is real
and how do you figure out what are good
sources and how to analyze what you're
looking at?
I think
I think that is going to increasingly
become such a bigger part of our world.
What is the right way for parents to
approach this?
I mean, Adam Mosseri was from Instagram,
was on stage here at screen time,
essentially saying we have to teach our
kids that what you see on the screen is
not necessarily what's happening in real
life.
What is the right way for us to talk to
our kids about this?
I think that we should start off kind of
keeping things light because parents get
so stressed out and nervous about this.
So I say, you know, first of all, just
ask a question like, what's the best or
funniest or most interesting thing
you've seen on social media lately?
And then from there, the parents can ask
more questions about frequency of use,
what platforms their child uses, what
content they consume.
So that gives you a kind of an opening.
And then you can get a little bit more
serious in terms of, you know, what
would you do if you saw something that
was upsetting, kind of listen,
non-judgmental, be open and let them
know that they can come to you and talk
to you if they have any concerns.
You know, I find it interesting this,
you know, Digital Wellness Lab and I am
so curious about I know you're involved
in it and may not know all the work that
they are doing, but give us some insight
into some of the projects that they're
working with or some of the concerns
that they have.
And maybe there's also some you know, I
don't want to be all negative, right?
I live on this, too, and I find it super
helpful.
I'm curious about some of the work that
you guys are doing there.
So I'm a consultant for the lab and
there's so much cool things happening
when it comes to advocacy, new research
and working directly with you.
I think that's one of the most exciting
things is they kind of Youth Advisory
Board is kind of talking to different,
different, different companies in the
space and letting them know how kids
really experience them.
And then we're doing very big surveys
where we're finding out kind of what
does this look like in the real world,
what our kids say with a parent saying,
what are they concerned about?
And kind of on your topic of is there
some positive stuff here?
And the answer is yes.
Kids can find connections, they can find
community, they can find good resources.
So it's like figuring out what is that
positive content and what are the things
that kind of make you feel not as good.
And the people we need to listen to the
most about this, our teenagers, our
kids,
they take a chance.
What is the right way for schools to to
deal with this technology?
I was actually pretty dismayed to find
my first grader came home just a few
weeks ago with the way that the
assignments were working this year.
Yeah, and he had an app, a website that
he was supposed to go to for math
homework a couple of times a week.
And I was like, Why don't we already
doing this on screens?
So it starts.
Is it a is it a better way?
Is he getting the information in a
better way than he would on paper?
I'm not a Luddite, but it just feels
like why should a first grader be?
Using a screen for this.
All like multi-modal learning is so
important for society right now.
So, you know, I'm hoping that your first
grader is also getting time to, like,
manipulate the math concepts in the
classroom and that the app is more of a
reinforcement.
Again, that's a positive piece of
content.
That's something that's something that's
going to add to his life versus kind of
passively sitting and taking in
something that may not be as healthy for
him.
So practicing your math skills at home
on an app that feels like one of those
things that we want to kind of go in the
right direction, even though it does
feel like here they come again, my kids
only six.
Why do they why do they have technology?
It's kind of putting all the pieces
together.
Dr.
Sinclair One thing I think about is
people who have seats at the table on
this or who want to have a seat at the
table, and we certainly see the big tech
leaders at the White House.
They're concerned about regulatory
oversight or burdens or access to
markets.
We see that in a big way.
Are tech leaders getting involved?
And the reason I bring this up, I
remember doing a panel at least ten
years ago with a bunch of tech folks who
said, yeah, my kids, I don't let them go
on a laptop.
There's no screen time for them.
So I'm wondering if tech leaders are
also involved in this discussion.
Yes.
And actually, one of the things that's
been so exciting about my work with the
Digital Wellness Lab is I've gotten to
be a part of some of these discussions
with some of the main tech companies
where we're kind of giving our insights
as Boston Children's.
This place where we're doing all kinds
of research and clinical work on kids
behavioral health, right, able to offer
that to them in terms of this is what
we're concerned about, this is what
we're seeing.
How can you guys think about this as
you're developing new technologies?
