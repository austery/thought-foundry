Sequoia
 is
 the
 most
 soughta
 name
 in
 the


venture
 capital
 business.


The
 firm
 has
 made
 over
 a
 thousand


investments
 now
 worth
 in
 the
 trillions


in
 public
 market
 value.


There's
 a
 list
 of
 five
 VCs
 who
 I
 think


can
 really
 transform
 a
 company
 and


you're
 one
 of
 those
 five.


When
 I
 joined
 Sequoia,
 it
 was
 clear
 that


if
 I
 wanted
 to
 make
 it
 as
 a
 partner,
 you


needed
 to
 produce
 meaningful
 games.


YouTube,
 Instagram,
 Square.
 This
 is
 a


list
 of
 amazing
 amazing
 startups.
 Our


ambition
 is
 to
 build
 a
 partnership
 that


endures
 and
 that
 means
 we
 need
 to
 leave


it
 in
 a
 better
 place
 than
 we
 found
 it.


Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 please
 welcome


Seoia
 Capitals
 Rolloff
 Botha.


See
 you.
 See
 you.
 What's
 up,
 bro?
 How


are
 you?
 Good
 to
 see
 you.


Welcome,


Ralph.
 There's
 a
 question.


What's
 that?
 Where
 did
 Saxs
 go?


Get
 to
 pee
 pee.
 He
 had
 to
 make
 a
 weiw


wee.


Come
 on.


You
 Yeah,
 exactly.
 You
 guys
 did
 work


together


for
 25
 years
 ago
 and
 he
 just
 abandons
 us


right
 now.


He's
 had
 enough
 of
 you.
 Um,
 everybody


wants
 to
 know
 who's
 your
 favorite


Sequoia
 scout
 of
 all
 time.


Let's
 go
 through
 it.


Jason
 Calakanas.


It
 is
 hilarious.
 Um,
 when
 you
 think


about
 it,
 you
 came
 to
 me,
 gosh,
 15
 years


ago,
 and
 you
 said,
 "I
 have
 an
 idea
 for
 a


program.
 It's
 called
 Sequoia
 Scouts.


We'd
 like
 to,
 um,
 have
 you
 go
 around
 and


invest
 in
 some
 companies."


And,
 uh,


no
 good
 deed
 shall
 go
 unpunished.


Absolutely.
 Created
 a
 monster.
 Um,
 but


that
 program


Sorry,
 before
 you
 ask
 your
 question,
 how


far
 are
 you
 going
 to
 insert
 your
 head
 up


Roloff's
 ass?


[Applause]


We
 sat
 him
 that
 far
 away
 for
 a
 reason.
 I


mean,
 um,
 sorry,
 bro.
 Jesus
 Christ.
 Go


on
 with
 your
 question.


That's


Let
 me
 land
 the
 question.


What's
 your
 question,
 D?


That
 program,
 um,
 had
 some
 that
 first


cohort
 of
 individuals


um,
 wound
 up
 being
 a
 pretty
 interesting


group
 of
 folks.
 Maybe
 you
 could
 tell


everybody
 just
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 that


program
 you
 conceived
 of
 and
 then
 who


were
 some
 of
 the
 first
 folks
 in
 it
 and


the
 first
 investments.
 We
 conceived
 of


this
 program
 as
 you
 mentioned
 in
 2010


when
 we
 launched
 it
 and
 the
 idea
 was


that
 there
 were
 a
 bunch
 of
 contemporary


founders
 who
 had
 very
 interesting
 access


to
 upand
 cominging
 founders
 who
 are


turning
 to
 them
 for
 advice
 but
 these


founders
 didn't
 yet
 have
 money
 at
 the


point
 that
 you
 became
 a
 scout.
 You


didn't
 have
 the
 net
 worth
 you
 have
 now


where
 you
 could
 write
 a
 check
 on
 your


own.
 And
 so
 we
 thought
 it'd
 be
 a
 great


program
 for
 us
 to
 provide
 the
 capital


for
 founders
 like
 yourself
 to
 be
 able
 to


invest
 in
 those
 companies
 and
 hopefully


we
 would
 get
 an
 introduction
 to
 those


companies
 for
 us
 to
 be
 able
 to
 make
 an


investment
 too.
 So
 uh
 you
 were
 in
 that


program
 you
 helped
 us
 with
 the


investment
 in
 Uber.
 Sam
 Alman
 was
 in


that
 group
 as
 well.
 He
 helped
 with
 an


investment
 in
 a
 little
 company
 called


Stripe.


They
 did.
 Okay.


So
 at
 this
 point
 that
 that
 fund
 is
 a
 26x


fund
 at
 this
 point.


Wow.
 That's
 up
 there
 in
 the


It's
 pretty
 good.
 What's
 the
 best
 fund


in
 the
 history
 of
 Sequoia?
 Was
 it
 the


Google
 fund,
 the
 WhatsApp
 fund?
 Which


one
 has
 the
 highest
 multiple
 in
 history?


Uh
 the
 highest
 multiple
 in
 history
 is
 uh


I
 think
 Venture
 12,
 which
 has
 Airbnb,


Dropbox,


Nera,


ADM
 Mob
 and
 a
 couple
 of
 other
 companies.


And
 then
 venture
 13
 which
 is
 the
 fund


right
 after
 that
 has
 stripe
 and
 square


now
 called
 block
 and
 a
 bunch
 of


other
 companies.
 So
 those
 were
 both


north
 of
 20x
 funds.
 Tell
 us
 about
 the


venture
 industry
 actually.
 So
 we're
 at
 a


point
 in
 the
 cycle
 where
 there's
 been
 a


lot
 of
 specialization
 both
 maybe
 at
 the


stage
 level
 at
 the
 sector
 level.
 There's


been
 all
 kinds
 of
 experimentation
 and


approaches
 in
 strategy.
 Can
 you
 just


level
 set
 on


what
 you've
 learned
 and
 what
 the


industry's
 learned
 and
 where
 we
 are?


I'm
 glad
 you
 called
 it
 an
 industry,
 not


an
 asset
 class.
 Um,
 I
 listened
 to
 one
 of


the
 shows
 you
 guys
 had
 recently
 and
 I


think
 there's
 a
 huge
 problem
 with
 the


venture
 industry
 that
 there's
 too
 much


money
 and
 you
 guys
 have
 talked
 about


this
 before.
 Uh,
 venture
 industry
 as
 a


whole
 invests
 right
 now
 between
 150
 to


$200
 billion
 a
 year
 was
 the
 last
 numbers


I
 saw.
 If
 you
 think
 about
 reasonable


assumptions
 for
 returns,
 let's
 just
 say


12%
 peranom
 net,
 which
 isn't
 great.


Might
 as
 well
 invest
 in
 an
 index
 fund,


the
 math
 basically
 implies
 that
 you
 need


three
 and
 a
 half
 to
 4x
 funds
 to
 make


that
 math
 work
 over
 a
 reasonable
 time


frame.
 So
 if
 you're
 investing,
 let's


just
 say
 $200
 billion
 a
 year.
 The


industry
 needs
 to
 give
 back
 7800
 billion


a
 year.
 VCs
 don't
 own
 100%
 of
 the


company
 last
 time
 I
 checked.
 So
 that


means
 that
 the
 aggregate
 exit
 value
 is


north
 of
 a
 trillion
 a
 year.


So
 Figma
 went
 public
 recently.
 They're


worth
 25$26
 billion.
 You
 need
 40
 Figmas


a
 year
 for
 the
 industry
 to
 make
 the


returns
 work,
 which
 means
 that
 they


don't.
 So
 in
 my
 opinion,
 investing
 in


venture
 is
 a
 returnfree
 risk.
 You


shouldn't.
 They're
 basically
 only
 about


20
 companies.


You
 said
 return


return
 free
 risk.


risk.


Exactly.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 every
 single


decade,
 there
 are
 only
 about
 20


companies
 that
 end
 up
 getting
 exit


values
 north
 of
 a
 billion
 dollars.


Actual
 IPOs
 or
 M&As
 north
 of
 a
 billion.


Not
 the
 paper
 writeups,
 only
 20


companies.
 More
 money
 doesn't
 create


more
 great
 ideas
 or
 more
 great
 founders.


So,
 I
 think
 there
 is
 way
 too
 much
 money


in
 the
 industry.
 The
 industry
 does


provide
 a
 lot
 of
 value.
 It
 provides
 some


of
 the
 knowhow
 for
 entrepreneurs
 to


succeed
 and
 obviously
 leads
 to
 job


creation
 and
 all
 the
 attendant
 benefits


for
 America.
 But
 there
 is
 too
 much
 money


and
 too
 many
 people
 who
 want
 to
 be


investors.


How
 does
 the
 money
 get
 level
 set
 then


and
 right
 sized
 for
 what
 is
 needed?


I've
 been
 wondering
 that
 for
 20
 years.


Uh
 this
 problem
 is
 a
 problem
 20
 years


ago.
 It
 is
 only


it's
 an
 incredibly
 sexy
 asset
 class.
 I


mean
 look,
 Jason
 writes
 a
 bestselling


book.
 It
 doesn't,
 you
 know,
 dissuade


people.
 It
 incentivizes
 more
 people
 to


say,
 "Oh,
 I
 can
 try
 this.
 I'll
 be
 like


it."
 I
 mean,
 it's
 just
 a
 self-fulfilling


prophecy.
 The
 more
 successes
 there
 are,


there's
 just
 um


Yeah.
 Everybody
 wants
 to
 go
 to
 Vegas


and,
 you
 know,
 strike
 it
 rich.
 It


doesn't
 happen.


Yeah.


That's
 part
 of the
 dynamic
 is
 that
 you


get
 a
 firm
 that
 has
 one
 success
 in
 their


fund
 and
 then
 they
 attract
 more
 capital


because
 people
 think
 it's
 repeatable
 and


it's
 not.


And
 you
 don't
 know
 you
 don't
 know
 that


till
 fund
 three
 or
 four.
 Like
 often
 they


raise
 fund
 three
 before
 they've
 even


oh
 they've
 raised
 fund
 two,
 three,
 four,


and
 five
 before
 even
 fund
 one
 is
 really


fully
 distributed
 a
 lot
 of
 times.
 So


what
 could
 change
 for
 one
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 I
 thought
 was
 transparency


but
 nobody
 wants
 to
 publish
 their


returns.
 You
 could
 publish
 your
 returns.


I
 publish
 my
 returns
 but
 you
 know
 I'm


not
 taking
 outside
 capital
 but
 would


that
 help?
 Like
 is
 it
 working
 with


people
 like
 Cambridge
 so
 that
 these


things
 become
 more
 public
 and
 more


understood?
 It
 seems
 like
 there's
 an


education
 element
 here
 that's
 missing
 on


behalf
 of
 the
 industry
 to
 the
 potential


LPS.
 I
 think
 people
 will
 still
 hide


behind
 the
 J
 curve
 effect
 and
 they'll


say
 yeah
 my
 fund
 is
 only
 at
 1.5x
 right


now
 but
 it's
 only
 four
 years
 in
 and
 you


know
 the
 winners
 are
 going
 to
 emerge
 and


so
 I
 think
 this
 this
 hope
 springs


eternal
 dynamic
 and
 such
 a
 long
 time


period
 of
 gestation
 before
 the
 companies


get
 realized
 that
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 uh


will
 change
 that
 dynamic
 unfortunately


there's
 also
 been
 this
 really


interesting
 effect
 where
 it's
 been
 this


industrialization
 of
 venture
 capital
 I


will
 call
 it
 so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


organization
 that
 has
 built
 the


organization
 that
 General
 Catalyst
 has


built.
 It's
 about
 this
 girthiness,


right,
 across
 many
 different
 things.


How
 has
 Sequoia
 reacted
 when
 they've


seen
 those
 movements?
 And
 I'm
 sure


you've
 had
 to
 sit
 down
 as
 a
 partnership


and
 say,
 are
 we
 matching
 this?
 Are
 we


copying
 this?
 Are
 we
 going
 to
 do
 the


same
 thing?
 Are
 we
 doing
 something


different?


That
 is
 a
 great
 question.
 The
 industry


has
 changed
 a
 lot
 since
 I
 got
 into


venture
 just
 over
 20
 years
 ago.
 If
 you


go
 back
 to
 the
 proverbial
 1990s
 venture


firm,
 it
 was,
 you
 know,
 a
 dozen
 people


sitting
 around
 a
 table
 making
 investment


decisions
 with
 very
 lightweight
 staff.


Uh,
 and
 it
 was
 much
 more
 of
 a
 cottage


industry.
 I
 think
 the
 industry
 is


professionalized
 and
 really
 the
 founders


are
 the
 ones
 who
 benefited
 from
 it


because
 all
 these
 firms
 have
 built


larger
 operating
 teams
 to
 be
 able
 to


help
 those
 founders
 with
 talent,
 with
 go


to
 market
 and
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 really


helping
 founders.
 That's
 probably
 the


main
 takeaway
 I
 have
 from
 that.
 We've


decided
 to
 not
 build
 as
 big
 an


organization.
 Most
 of
 the
 operating


teams
 we
 have
 at
 Sequoia
 help
 us.
 So
 we


have
 about
 as
 many
 developers
 at
 Sequoia


as
 we
 have
 investors
 and
 they're


building
 products
 for
 us
 so
 that
 we
 are


much
 more
 effective
 and
 productive
 than


we
 might
 have
 been
 20
 years
 ago.


What's
 an
 example
 of
 that
 that
 they're


building
 for
 you?


Uh
 so
 you
 know
 my
 phone
 I
 can
 pull
 up
 an


app
 that
 I
 if
 you
 give
 me
 any
 company


name
 I'll
 be
 able
 to
 tell
 you
 who
 my


team
 last
 met,
 how
 we
 rated
 it.
 I'll


give
 you
 uh
 data
 on
 what's
 happening


with
 their
 hiring.
 Uh
 how
 many
 vouched


employees
 they
 have,
 how
 good
 do
 we


think
 their
 engineering
 team
 is
 based
 on


their
 history,
 their
 academic
 profiles,


etc.
 All
 this
 information
 is
 at
 my


fingertips.
 Uh
 if
 we
 get
 business
 plan


submissions,
 we
 have
 an
 AI
 system
 that


will
 summarize
 it
 for
 me.
 So
 I
 get
 a


very
 quick
 read
 on
 the
 company,
 a
 quick


summarization
 of
 the
 quality
 of
 the
 team


and
 a
 very
 quick
 analysis
 of
 the


competitive
 dynamics
 and
 the
 other


companies
 I
 should
 consider
 alongside


them.
 So
 these
 are
 just
 small
 examples


of
 the
 things
 we
 do.
 We
 just
 had
 Joe


Saiion
 on.
 We're
 talking
 a
 bit
 about
 the


relationship
 between
 America
 and
 China.


You
 had
 a
 fabulous
 business
 in
 China
 for


two
 decades,
 I
 believe,


with
 Neil.


Yeah.


And
 it
 did
 absolutely
 fantastic.
 But


then
 the
 government
 of
 the
 United
 States


said,
 "Hey,
 we
 cannot
 as
 venture


capitalists
 invest
 in
 China
 anymore."


So,
 what
 are
 your
 what's
 your
 take
 on


the
 the
 opportunity
 in
 China?
 Will
 that


return?
 and
 and
 just
 the
 the
 experience


you
 had
 with
 all
 those
 incredible
 hits


at
 the
 time.


When
 we
 first
 went
 into
 China,
 it
 was


2007
 I
 think.
 Uh
 the
 world
 was
 flat
 was


the
 moniker
 at
 the
 time.
 China
 gained


admission
 to
 the
 World
 Trade


Organization
 in
 I
 think
 2001


and
 we
 all
 believed
 that
 it
 would


integrate
 into
 the
 global
 economy.
 That


premise
 proved
 wrong.
 And
 so
 we
 had
 a


period
 where
 it
 was
 really
 interesting


to
 be
 able
 to
 share
 knowledge
 and
 share


ideas
 and
 sort
 of
 figure
 out
 how
 we
 can


build
 a
 globally
 interconnected
 set
 of


systems
 and
 companies.
 Uh
 and
 life
 just


got
 too
 hard
 for
 that
 honestly
 and
 we


saw
 just
 more
 division
 between
 the
 two


countries.
 So
 we
 embarked
 on
 global


separation
 just
 over
 2
 years
 ago
 and


what
 used
 to
 be
 China
 is
 now
 an


independent
 business
 called
 Hongchan
 and


they're
 off
 to
 the
 races.
 I
 think


there's
 a
 real
 challenge
 in
 China
 right


now.
 Uh
 some
 stat
 I
 got
 recently
 in
 2018


there
 were
 51,000
 companies
 started
 in


China.
 In
 20123
 it
 was
 1,200.


Wow.


How
 many?


1,200.
 You
 had
 a
 98%


reduction
 in
 the
 number
 of
 companies


founded
 in
 China.
 Cuz
 if
 you're
 an


entrepreneur
 in
 China,
 why
 would
 you


want
 to
 start
 a
 company
 when
 the


government
 regulations
 are
 so
 uncertain?


Which
 by
 the
 way
 is
 an
 interesting


warning
 sign
 for
 me
 for
 us
 in
 America
 as


we
 think
 about
 AI
 policy
 and
 AI


regulation.
 The
 more
 uncertainty
 we


create
 for
 founders,
 the
 more
 difficult


it
 is
 for
 them
 to
 actually
 take
 that


risk,
 take
 that
 leap
 to
 start
 a


business.
 So,
 but
 Chinese


entrepreneurship
 is
 still
 strong.
 So,


you
 see
 many
 Chinese
 entrepreneurs
 now


operating
 in
 Latin
 America,
 they
 move
 to


Singapore,
 they're
 in
 uh
 Japan,
 they're


moving
 to
 Europe.
 I
 mean,
 you
 can't


repress
 that
 spirit.
 Rolof,
 there's
 a


interesting
 dynamic
 that
 I
 observed


which
 is
 you
 have
 the
 early
 early
 stage


venture
 companies
 who
 have
 had
 an


incredible
 track
 record.
 you
 guys,


Benchmark,
 Kosla,


and
 then
 what
 happens
 is
 you
 have
 these


latest
 stage
 firms,
 but
 many
 of
 the


companies
 that
 they
 fund
 need
 so
 much


money
 that
 the
 latestage
 firms
 can't


service
 them.
 So,
 you
 have
 to
 go
 direct.


You
 go
 right
 to
 Saudi,
 you
 go
 right
 to


the
 Qataris,
 you
 go
 right
 to
 the


Amiradis,
 you
 go
 right
 to
 Norway,
 you


know,
 these
 sovereign
 wealth
 funds
 that


are
 writing
 these
 big
 checks.
 And
 so,
 it


creates
 this
 really
 weird
 dynamic
 where


you
 almost
 become
 this
 kind
 of
 glorified


placement
 agent
 almost.
 So
 there's
 this


part
 of
 the
 curve
 and
 then
 there's
 all


this
 money
 that
 goes
 over
 here.
 How
 do


you
 adapt
 the
 business
 in
 the
 face
 of


that
 dynamic?


Well,
 we
 stick
 to
 our
 knitting.
 Uh
 the


funds
 we
 operate
 today,
 our
 seed
 venture


and
 growth
 funds
 today
 are
 no
 bigger


than
 they
 were
 5,
 six,
 seven
 years
 ago.


We
 we
 realize
 that
 there's
 money
 to
 be


made
 for
 some
 people
 writing
 very
 large


checks
 and
 very
 latest
 stage
 companies.


But
 uh
 our
 aspiration
 is
 to
 be
 the


number
 one
 investment
 manager
 for
 our


limited
 partners.
 We
 literally
 want
 to


be
 the
 best
 net
 IRRa
 and
 net
 multiple


for
 our
 LPS
 and
 we're
 not
 interested
 in


maximizing
 fees
 or
 maximizing
 share
 of


industry
 value
 creation.


That's
 the
 game
 we've
 chosen
 to
 play.


And
 so
 there's
 no
 path
 where
 Sequoa
 for


example
 tries
 to
 go
 public
 or
 take
 the


you
 know
 that's
 like
 it's
 just
 not
 in


the
 strategy
 of
 the
 business.
 No,


actually
 we've
 structured
 ourselves
 to


be
 a
 private
 partnership
 in
 perpetuity


to
 the
 extent
 possible
 under
 California


law.
 We
 have
 the
 sense
 of
 stewardship.


You
 have
 to
 leave
 the
 partnership
 in
 a


better
 place
 than
 you
 found
 it.
 Don


Valentine
 didn't
 call
 it
 Valentine


Ventures
 when
 he
 started
 it.
 He
 handed


the
 partnership
 over
 to
 a
 next


generation
 with
 Mike
 Meritz
 and
 Doug


Leone
 and
 Jim
 Gett.
 And
 you
 know,
 we're


now
 part
 of
 a
 third
 generation,
 our
 team


currently
 running
 the
 partnership.
 We


didn't
 have
 to
 pay
 to
 get
 the


partnership
 from
 the
 previous
 generation


and
 nor
 will
 we
 charge
 the
 next


generation.
 That's
 that's
 our
 motto.


How
 would
 you
 describe
 the
 culture


that's
 driven
 the
 success
 rolloff?
 So


when
 you
 select
 partners,
 what
 do
 you


look
 for?
 How
 do
 you
 value
 those


partners?
 How
 do
 you
 assess
 the


performance
 of
 those
 partners?
 And
 how


do
 you
 guys
 operate
 that
 kind
 of
 defines


the
 culture?


So
 I
 think
 the
 probably
 the
 most


important
 characteristic
 we
 look
 for
 is


an
 insatiable
 curiosity
 in
 the


individual.
 We
 look
 for
 people
 who are


extremely
 driven,
 but
 they
 need
 to
 have


a
 heart
 of
 gold.
 So
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we


talk
 about
 at
 Squay
 is
 um
 we
 cherish


individualism
 and
 teamwork.
 You
 need
 an


individual
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 a
 keen


insight
 and
 propose
 an
 investment
 but


you've
 got
 to
 work
 with
 a
 team
 and
 that


the
 whole
 teamwork
 aspect
 is
 really


important
 for
 us.
 So
 when
 you
 make


investment
 decisions
 at
 Sequoa
 it's
 a


consensus
 decision
 which
 blew
 my
 mind


when
 I
 first
 got
 there.
 I


meaning
 everybody
 has
 to
 agree.


Everybody
 has
 to
 agree.


So
 if
 one
 person
 says
 no
 it
 doesn't


happen.


Correct.


So
 one
 person
 can
 veto
 an
 investment.


Correct.
 And
 that
 happens
 often
 or


it
 has.
 Sometimes
 it
 was
 a
 good
 decision


and
 sometimes
 not.


What
 do
 the
 statistics
 tell
 you?


What's
 the
 worst
 uh
 thing
 somebody


killed?


Oh
 jeez.


It's
 okay.
 We're
 all
 friends
 here.


What
 is
 that
 list
 called
 when
 you
 have


that?


Yeah,
 you
 would
 call
 it
 your
 anti


portfolio.


Anti
 portfolio.


But
 in
 this
 case,
 somebody


wasn't
 just
 an
 anti
 portfolio.
 It's
 like


everyone
 agreed
 we
 should
 do
 it
 except


the
 one.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 so
 you
 think
 about
 that


responsibility
 uh


and
 it
 weighs
 on
 people,


but
 it
 means
 that
 you
 need
 to
 show
 up


with
 your
 best
 game
 every
 single
 day.


And
 you
 know,
 part
 of
 what
 we've
 done
 is


we
 look
 at
 the
 vote
 distribution
 these


days
 and
 look,
 if
 somebody
 shows
 up
 and


everybody's
 really
 positive,
 there
 a


bunch
 of
 people
 that
 are
 eight
 nines
 out


of
 10
 and
 there's
 one
 person
 who
 clearly


woke
 up
 at
 the,
 you
 know,
 in
 a
 bad
 mood


and
 is
 a
 three,
 you
 know,
 at
 some
 point


that
 person
 will
 probably
 say,
 "Listen,


maybe
 I
 just
 don't
 get
 it."


This
 actually
 happened
 to
 me.
 We


listened
 to
 a
 company
 in
 late
 November.


This
 company
 is
 thriving
 right
 now.


They're
 in
 the
 it's
 pretty
 sax
 isn't


here
 because
 this
 company's
 benefiting


from
 stable
 coins
 with
 the
 genius
 act


that
 he
 helped
 put
 in
 place
 is
 really


benefiting
 from
 that
 and
 I
 didn't
 quite


get
 this
 company
 at
 the
 time
 and
 I
 was


the
 only
 person
 who
 was
 below
 the
 line


and
 I
 said
 listen
 there's
 something
 I'm


missing
 in
 this
 particular
 company.
 I


think
 we
 should
 proceed
 with
 the


investment
 even
 though
 my
 intuition


walking
 in
 was
 that
 we
 shouldn't


and
 I'm
 really
 glad
 that
 we
 proceeded.


So


can
 you
 tell
 us
 about
 the
 holding


company
 transition
 that
 you
 underwent


and
 the
 role
 of
 being
 a
 venture


capitalist
 in
 making
 an
 exit
 decision?


So
 we
 did
 this
 conversation
 on
 the
 show


a
 few
 weeks
 ago.
 Pulled
 up
 some


analysis.
 The
 biggest
 winners
 continue


to
 compound
 as
 public
 companies.
 99%
 of


the
 returns
 are
 as
 a
 public
 company
 or


whatever
 it
 is.
 So
 it
 looks
 like
 an


amazing
 exit
 goes
 public.


But
 that's
 not
 the
 end
 of
 the
 value


creation.
 True
 compounders
 compound
 for


decades.
 Especially
 founders
 are
 still


in
 the
 seat.
 Amazon,
 Nvidia
 was
 a


Sequoia
 investment.
 I
 think
 Google,
 I


mean,
 these
 are
 multi-trillion
 dollar


companies
 that
 if
 you
 guys
 held
 your


position
 to
 today,
 I'm
 assuming
 things


would
 look
 a
 little
 bit
 different.


It
 would.
 Yes.
 So,
 so
 we
 backed
 a
 bunch


of
 very
 interesting
 companies
 over
 our


50
 years.
 Uh,
 the
 companies
 in
 which
 we


were
 private
 investors
 when
 they
 were


little
 companies


today
 account
 for
 over
 30%
 of
 the
 total


value
 of
 the
 NASDAQ.


Wow.


There's
 no
 other
 30%


over
 30%
 of
 the
 combined
 value
 of
 the


NASDAQ.


Apple,
 Nvidia,


Apple,
 Cisco,
 Nvidia,
 Google,
 Pala


Network,
 Service
 Now,
 uh
 I
 mean
 the
 list


goes
 on.
 So


pretty
 pretty
 good.


So
 So
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 realized,


what
 you're
 alluding
 to
 is
 in
 2022,
 we


launched
 something
 called
 the
 Sequoa


Capital
 Fund.
 And
 so
 we
 realized
 that


the
 great
 companies
 continue
 to
 compound


as
 you
 talked
 about
 in
 that
 episode.
 It


was
 it
 was
 an
 excellent
 episode


obviously.
 Um,
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 even
 in


more
 recent
 memory,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


last
 10-ish
 years,
 Palto,
 Service
 Now,


HubSpot,
 MongoDB,
 these
 companies
 have


all
 been
 10
 X's
 as
 public
 companies.
 And


so,
 we've
 realized
 that
 when
 we


distribute
 shares
 prematurely
 to
 LPs,


they
 don't
 know
 any
 better
 because,
 you


know,
 they
 run
 a
 big
 endowment.
 They


suddenly
 get
 $5
 million
 worth
 of
 company


ABC.
 They
 don't
 know
 any
 better.
 They


sell
 the
 shares.
 So,
 what
 we've
 decided


to
 do
 is
 for
 the
 companies
 that
 we


believe
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 compound


longer
 term,
 we
 have
 a
 different
 fund


structure.
 And
 so
 6
 12
 18
 months
 after


the
 IPO,
 we
 can
 move
 those
 shares
 into


this
 fund
 called
 the
 Sequoa
 Capital


Fund.
 And
 this
 now
 becomes
 the
 vehicle


through
 which
 we
 fund
 all
 our
 next


underlying
 investment
 vehicles.
 Now
 to


give
 you
 a
 sense,
 since
 we
 launched
 this


3
 and
 a
 half
 years
 ago,
 we've


accumulated
 another
 6.7
 billion
 in
 gains


by
 doing
 nothing
 except
 being
 patient.


$6.7
 billion
 in
 gains
 that
 our
 LPs
 would


not
 have
 seen
 if
 we
 had
 just
 distributed


those
 shares
 outright.


Yeah,
 you're
 making
 him
 moan.
 He's


moaning.


I
 like
 it.
 I'm
 getting
 I'm
 getting


getting
 warm
 and
 he's
 getting
 emotional.


But
 what
 is
 but
 what
 is
 the
 So
 the


counterargument
 is
 as
 a
 public
 company,


you
 as
 venture
 capitalists
 who
 are


excellent
 at
 interrogating
 early
 stage


technology,
 early
 stage
 metrics,
 founder


personalities,
 all
 the
 things
 that
 might


make
 a
 good
 venture
 capital
 investor.


Maybe
 as
 a
 public
 company,
 quarter
 to


quarter,
 are
 they
 growing
 12%,
 14%.


There's
 a
 different
 analytical
 skill
 set


some
 might
 argue
 like
 you
 know
 that
 that


belongs
 in
 that
 investment
 domain
 and


frankly
 very
 hard
 to
 beat
 the
 indust


indices
 doing
 that.
 What's
 the
 argument


to
 be
 made
 to
 the
 counter
 and
 why
 would


you
 counter
 that
 argument?


So
 see
 one
 of
 the
 things
 for
 us
 is
 that


the
 I
 mean
 most
 of these
 cases
 we're


involved
 with
 these
 companies
 literally


at
 inception.
 I
 mean
 Palo
 Alto
 Networks


was
 incubated
 inside
 our
 office
 with
 one


founder
 and
 my
 partner
 Jim
 Gates.
 So,


we've
 known
 these
 companies
 since
 the


earliest
 of
 days.
 Why
 should
 that


relationship
 end
 at
 the
 IPO?


And
 in
 most
 of these
 cases,
 as
 you


pointed
 out,
 the
 founders
 are
 still


there
 and
 there's
 so
 much
 more


innovation
 taking
 place.
 Um,
 Jack


Dorsey's
 one
 of
 Jack
 Dorsey's
 favorite


quotes
 to
 me
 was
 companies
 have
 multiple


founding
 moments.
 And
 so
 when
 you're
 in


a
 company
 where
 the
 the
 founder
 keeps


reinventing
 the
 business,
 you
 know,
 a


company
 like
 Square,
 half
 the
 revenue


today
 comes
 from
 a
 product
 called
 Cash


App
 that
 hadn't
 launched
 for
 the
 first
 5


years
 in
 the
 company's
 life.
 And
 so
 if


you
 can
 find
 these
 companies,
 these


special
 companies
 where
 the
 founders


keep
 pushing
 the
 boundary
 on
 innovation


and
 they
 are
 relentless,
 then
 it
 works.


Google
 buying
 YouTube.


Don't
 remind
 me.


Do
 you
 think
 it
 would
 have
 been
 the


same?
 Would
 YouTube
 still
 have
 had
 the


same
 outcome
 if
 it
 wasn't
 acquired?
 To


be
 clear,
 RUF
 wrote
 in
 his
 first
 year
 or


two
 at
 the
 company,
 the
 deal
 memo
 to


invest
 in
 YouTube
 and
 it
 got
 bought
 for


1.6
 billion.
 Standalone
 business
 today


would
 be
 worth
 400500
 billion.


And
 then
 Google
 then
 invested
 quite


significantly
 in
 infrastructure
 and


enabling
 scalability
 and
 building
 out
 a


team
 and
 building
 out
 an
 ad
 revenue


system,
 etc.
 We've
 got
 Neil
 here


tomorrow
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 current
 state


of
 YouTube,
 but
 do
 you
 think
 it
 could


have
 taken
 the
 same?
 It's
 hard
 to
 say.


Hard
 to
 say.
 Uh
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 credit


should
 go
 to
 Google
 for
 the
 way
 that


they
 managed
 YouTube
 after
 the


acquisition,
 both
 in
 the
 resources
 they


provided,
 the
 leadership
 um
 and
 they've


enabled
 it
 to
 thrive.
 This
 is
 one
 of
 my


favorite
 things
 that
 Peter
 Thiel
 says
 is


uh
 you
 know
 when
 you
 make
 it
 when
 an


acquisition
 like
 this
 happens
 one
 side


was
 orders
 of
 magnitude
 off
 like
 it
 was


just
 a
 zero
 or
 it
 was
 100
 more
 than
 what


they
 paid.
 Something
 is
 always
 off.


Anyway,


Don
 Valentine
 um
 the
 founder
 of
 the
 firm


drew
 a
 four
 quadrant
 chart
 at
 one
 point


to
 explain
 the
 founders


that
 uh
 perform
 extremely
 well
 in
 terms


of
 returns.
 Maybe
 you
 could
 explain
 that


to
 the
 audience.


Yes.
 Uh
 Don
 pulled
 me
 aside
 in
 the
 early


days
 when
 I
 joined
 Sequoia
 and
 he
 said


2x2
 matrix
 uh
 people
 are
 exceptional
 not


exceptional
 easy
 to
 get
 along
 with
 not


so
 easy
 to
 get
 along
 with.
 Ruof
 we


normally
 make
 money
 in
 one
 of
 those
 four


quadrants.
 Your
 job
 is
 to
 figure
 out


which
 one


and
 it's
 the
 exceptional
 people
 who
 are


not
 so
 easy
 to
 get
 along
 with.


Uh
 so
 then
 let's
 talk
 about
 the
 next


generation.


I'm
 sorry.
 Can
 we
 just
 double
 click
 on


that?
 Why
 do
 you
 think
 that
 is?


These
 people
 change
 the
 world.
 They


don't
 take
 no
 for
 an
 an
 for
 an
 answer,


right?
 They
 are


How
 does
 it
 Why
 does
 that
 make
 them
 hard


to
 get
 along
 with,
 per
 se?


Well,
 I
 think
 he
 was
 he
 was
 saying
 that


a
 little
 bit
 tongue
 and
 cheek,
 right?


But
 this
 is
 a
 guy
 who
 backed
 Steve
 Jobs


when
 Steve
 would
 walk
 around
 Sand
 Hill


Road
 without
 shoes.
 He'd
 come
 back
 from


a
 trip
 to
 India.
 Allegedly,
 he
 didn't


smell
 too
 great.
 Um,
 and
 he
 was
 unusual


and
 nobody
 wanted
 to
 back
 him.
 And
 you


know,
 Don
 wanted
 to
 find
 these


underdogs,
 these
 unknown


Atari.


Well,
 apparently
 some
 of
 the
 Atari
 board


meetings
 took
 place
 in
 hot
 tubs.


Yes.


Uh
 he
 told,


by
 the
 way,
 that's
 how
 he
 got
 to
 Steve


because
 Steve
 had
 worked
 at
 Atari.


That's
 how
 Don
 got
 the
 introduction
 to


Steve.
 So,
 so
 I
 think
 part
 of
 the
 point


he
 was
 trying
 to
 make
 is
 don't
 look
 for


the
 people
 that,
 you
 know,
 went
 to
 all


the
 right
 schools
 and
 wear
 the
 right


clothes,
 all
 the
 conventional
 stuff.


Founders
 are
 unconventional.
 These


people
 change
 the
 world.
 I
 mean,
 most
 of


us
 encounter
 challenges
 every
 single
 day


and
 we
 accommodate.
 you
 know,
 this
 thing


isn't
 quite
 to
 your
 liking,
 you
 adapt.


Founders
 don't.
 Founders
 see
 things
 and


go,
 hm,
 I
 think
 the
 world
 can
 look


different
 and
 then
 they
 go
 and
 try
 to


fix
 it.
 They
 just
 don't
 take
 no
 for
 an


answer.


So,
 let's
 fast
 forward
 to
 your
 two


mentors,
 Michael
 Moritz
 and
 Doug
 Leone.


Two
 very
 different
 characters
 when
 the


story
 gets
 told,
 maybe
 a
 rivalry
 there


um
 between
 the
 two
 of
 them.
 What
 did
 you


learn
 from
 each?


Sure.
 From
 Doug,
 I
 learned
 heart.


Unpack
 it.
 Doug
 has
 an
 incredible
 heart.


When
 did
 you
 see
 that
 most?
 What
 was
 the


moment
 that's
 coming
 to
 your
 mind
 right


now
 that
 you
 probably
 shouldn't
 talk


about?


Well,
 the
 I'll
 give
 you
 two
 examples.


One
 was
 in
 2009
 when
 I
 was
 in
 a
 funk.
 I


nearly
 quit
 the
 business.
 Um


I
 didn't
 know
 this
 really.


Well,
 we'd
 had
 the
 YouTube
 was
 a
 great


success.
 Uh
 and
 I
 felt
 very
 good
 about


that.
 And
 then
 you
 in
 venture
 after
 a


few
 years
 you
 val
 you
 walk
 through
 the


valley
 of
 despair
 and
 you
 start
 to


realize
 the
 things
 you
 should
 have


invested
 in
 that
 you
 didn't
 and
 the


lemons
 start
 to
 drop
 the
 things
 that
 you


did
 invest
 in
 that
 are
 not
 working
 out.


So
 yes
 there
 was
 the
 one
 great
 quick


exit
 but
 then
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 things


and
 I
 was
 really
 having
 a
 lot
 of


self-doubt
 and
 Doug
 showed
 up
 at
 my


house
 with
 a
 homemade
 pesto
 jar


and
 he
 didn't
 need
 to.
 It
 was
 on
 a


Saturday
 afternoon.
 He
 knocks
 on
 my


door.
 Who's
 this
 person
 at
 my
 house?
 and


he
 just
 wanted
 to
 tell
 me
 that
 he
 was


there
 to
 support
 me
 through
 this
 dark


period.
 That
 was
 one
 example.
 Another


one
 was
 when
 uh
 my
 son
 was
 in
 hospital


and
 Doug
 showed
 up.


Didn't
 have
 to.
 Um
 that
 meant
 a
 lot
 to


me.
 So,


and
 Michael,


Michael's
 imagination.


Michael
 just
 has
 an
 unbelievable
 ability


to
 imagine
 how
 a
 company
 can
 succeed.


And
 when
 I
 thought
 about
 my
 mistakes
 as


an
 investor,
 by
 the
 way,
 every
 single


time
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 a
 failure
 of


imagination,
 that
 I
 didn't
 think
 big


enough.
 I
 didn't
 think
 about
 how
 this


company
 could
 uh
 progress
 from
 where


they
 were.
 You
 first
 introduced
 me
 to


Twitter
 2007.


I
 have
 the
 emails


before
 smartphones
 launched
 and
 it
 was


an
 SMS
 app.
 I
 got
 tired
 of
 getting
 all


your
 I'm
 having
 cappuccino
 messages
 on


Twitter
 at
 the
 time.
 I
 remember


on
 your
 Blackberry.
 Yeah.


And
 I
 didn't
 quite
 imagine
 that
 it
 could


be
 what
 it
 is
 today.
 And
 so
 that
 to
 me


was
 an
 example.
 Uh,
 I
 remember
 an
 early


meeting
 with
 Yelp
 with
 Jeremy
 Stppleman


and
 Max
 Lechin
 in
 our
 offices
 and
 I
 mean


Yelp
 hadn't
 launched
 a
 web
 app
 that
 were


going
 to
 be
 an
 email
 newsletter
 thing


and
 Michael
 in
 this
 meeting
 said
 I


imagine
 that
 one
 day
 restaurants
 will


put
 a
 Yelp
 sticker
 in
 the
 window
 just


like
 a
 Zagat
 or
 a
 Michelin
 star.
 And
 he


saw
 that.


He
 saw
 that.


He
 saw
 that.
 I
 mean
 10
 years
 before
 that


became
 a
 reality
 he
 had
 the
 imagination


to
 think
 about
 that.
 That
 to
 me
 is


amazing.
 So
 now
 Doug
 is
 still
 there
 and


Mike
 has
 transitioned
 out.
 Is
 that
 the


what
 is


Yes,
 Michael
 has
 transitioned
 out


completely.
 Doug
 has
 stepped
 back
 from


day-to-day
 investing.
 So
 he's
 no
 longer


in
 partner
 meetings
 routinely,
 but
 he


continues
 to
 serve
 on
 several
 boards.


And
 you're
 in
 charge.


I'm
 the
 leader
 of
 a
 team
 and
 I
 think
 of


more
 like
 being
 captain
 of
 the
 team.
 You


play
 team
 sport.
 We
 play
 team
 sport
 at


Sequoia
 and
 you
 know
 we
 are
 equal


partners
 and
 you
 know
 it's


Was
 it
 hard
 to
 see
 those
 two
 guys
 go


just
 seeing
 how
 legendary
 they
 were?


to
 succeed
 them?
 No.


Well,
 both
 to
 succeed
 them,
 but
 also


just
 to
 see
 them
 walk
 out
 the
 door.


Like,
 is
 there
 a
 tendency
 to
 want
 to


keep
 them
 around
 as
 long
 as
 possible?
 I


understand
 the
 question.
 Um,
 well,
 well,


firstly,
 it
 is
 very
 hard
 to
 succeed


them.
 I
 think
 every
 single
 person
 in


Sequoia
 feels
 this
 enormous
 burden
 and


responsibility
 to
 try
 to
 match
 the


performance
 that
 we've
 been
 known
 for,


you
 know,
 but
 we
 have
 this
 great


generational
 transition
 at
 Sequoa.
 So,


Michael
 stepped
 back
 from
 day-to-day


activity
 in
 2012


and
 he
 was


Morris
 did
 in
 2012.
 of
 Michael
 stepped


back.
 He
 had
 personal
 health
 reasons
 and


he
 stepped
 back.
 He
 continued
 to
 serve


on
 the
 boards
 that
 he
 was
 on
 and
 we
 we


had
 him
 for
 another
 decade
 where
 I
 would


ask
 him
 for
 advice.
 You
 know,
 as
 we
 were


going
 through
 global
 separation
 that
 we


talked
 about
 earlier,
 I
 would
 ask
 Doug


and
 Michael,
 you
 know,
 what
 do
 you
 think


should
 we
 you
 know,
 what
 should
 we
 be


doing
 here?
 Do
 you
 have
 advice
 for
 me?


And
 so
 it's
 a
 we
 have
 this
 benefit
 of


intergenerational
 uh
 knowledge
 transfer.


Uh
 Doug
 was
 on
 a
 call
 earlier
 today.


Actually,
 we
 had
 a
 difficult


conversation.
 I
 wanted
 his
 input
 on
 an


important
 question
 and
 it's
 not
 because


he
 has
 the
 authority
 to
 tell
 me
 what
 to


do.
 It's
 because
 I
 seek
 out
 his
 advice.


You
 were
 investing
 in
 traditional


software,
 internet
 services
 for
 years


and
 then
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 ago
 you


started
 investing
 in
 some
 life
 sciences.


Does
 life
 sciences
 kind
 of
 work
 as
 a


venture
 investment
 today?
 And
 what's


been
 the
 challenge
 in
 biotech
 and
 life


sciences
 investing
 generally
 over
 the


last
 few
 years?
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


notoriety
 about
 the
 collapse
 of
 the


market
 and
 even
 Dave
 Ricks
 today
 was


saying
 most
 public
 biotech
 companies
 are


trading
 below
 cash.
 What's
 your


observations
 on
 the
 business
 model,
 what


you've
 seen,
 the
 types
 of
 businesses


you've
 invested
 in
 there?
 So,


so
 the
 business
 we
 invested
 in
 uh
 that


has
 done
 really
 well
 is
 a
 company
 called


Nater.
 Uh
 and
 we
 made
 a
 seed
 investment


of
 a
 million
 dollars
 in
 2007
 in
 this


company.


It's
 20
 billion
 now,
 right?
 Market
 cap.


$22
 billion
 market
 cap.
 It
 was
 a
 million


dollars.
 two
 people
 uh
 with
 a
 a
 very
 raw


idea
 and
 today
 they're
 the
 leading


provider
 of
 prenatal
 testing,
 oncology,


recurrence
 monitoring,
 organ
 transplant


projection
 testing.
 And
 so
 that


company's
 been
 a
 huge
 success.


Diagnostics,
 genetic
 diagnostics,
 has


been
 a
 huge
 success.
 And
 you
 think
 about


the
 the
 dividend
 we're
 still
 collecting


from
 the
 human
 genome
 project
 25
 years


ago.
 It's
 incredible.
 And
 you've


obviously
 seen
 that
 in
 some
 of
 the


businesses
 that
 you've
 helped
 build
 as


well.
 uh
 we
 did
 make
 an
 investment
 in
 a


company
 called
 Bridge
 Bio
 which
 is


helping
 with
 rare
 genetic
 disease
 drug


development.
 Uh
 but
 other
 than
 that
 I


think
 we're
 we
 just
 don't
 have
 the


expertise
 for
 biotech.
 You
 know
 we
 don't


have
 any
 M


but
 there
 are
 still
 winners.


There
 are
 still
 winners
 but
 we
 have
 no


MD
 PhDs
 on
 our
 team
 at
 Sequoia.
 And
 I


think
 you
 know
 it's
 very
 dangerous
 when


people
 think
 that
 your
 success
 in
 one


domain
 just
 naturally
 makes
 you
 uh
 gives


you
 the
 right
 to
 compete
 in
 other


domains.
 I
 think
 I
 have
 tremendous


respect
 for
 the
 people
 who
 understand


that.
 I
 do
 not.


I
 learned
 that
 one
 the
 hard
 way.


Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 Roloff.


Thank
 you.


Thank
 you.


Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Thank
 you,
 sir.
 I


appreciate
 you
 coming
 out.
 Thanks.
