From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Friday,
 October
 10th.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


[Music]


[Applause]


People


have
 spent
 the
 last
 day
 in
 the
 streets


celebrating
 news
 of
 a
 deal.


There
 are
 no
 words
 to
 describe
 the


feeling
 today.
 Spontaneous
 joy,


excitement,
 tears.


The
 agreement
 between
 Israel
 and
 Hamas


calls
 for
 all
 the
 remaining
 Israeli


hostages
 to
 be
 set
 free
 and
 could
 pave


the
 way
 for
 an
 end
 to
 the
 conflict
 after


2
 years
 of
 brutal
 war.


It's
 something
 that
 nobody
 thought
 was


possible
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 end
 up


having
 peace
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.
 Who


would
 have
 thought?


President
 Trump,
 who
 helped
 broker
 the


deal,
 said
 he'll
 head
 to
 the
 Middle
 East


in
 the
 next
 few
 days
 to
 attend
 a
 signing


of
 the
 agreement
 and
 to
 see
 the
 hostages


returned.


That'll
 be
 a
 day
 of
 joy.
 I'm
 going
 to


try
 and
 make
 a
 trip
 over.
 We're
 going
 to


try
 and
 get
 over
 there.


Still,
 a
 lot
 of
 crucial
 issues
 have
 yet


to
 be
 resolved.


If
 Hamas
 carries
 out
 its
 part
 of
 the


agreement,
 is
 this
 the
 end
 of
 the
 war?


Well,
 it's
 the
 implementation
 of
 the


first
 phase.
 We
 don't
 have
 any
 intention


to
 renew
 the
 war,
 but
 parts
 of
 the


commitment
 is,
 for
 example,
 the


disarmment
 of
 Hamas.


But
 we
 will
 we
 will
 first
 have
 a


ceasefire.


In
 an
 interview
 on
 Fox
 News,
 Israel's


foreign
 minister
 said
 some
 questions


still
 need
 to
 be
 answered,
 like
 whether


Hamas
 will
 agree
 to
 disarm,
 which
 the


group
 has
 refused
 to
 do
 in
 the
 past.
 The


initial
 agreement
 doesn't
 appear
 to
 have


addressed
 that
 or
 the
 issue
 of
 who
 will


control
 Gaza
 after
 the
 war
 ends.


In
 terms
 of
 next
 steps,
 the
 US
 announced


it's
 sending
 200
 troops
 to
 Israel
 to


help
 coordinate
 and
 monitor
 how
 the
 deal


is
 implemented.
 That
 will
 include


specialists
 in
 logistics
 and
 security,


who
 will
 join
 other
 soldiers
 from
 Egypt,


Qatar,
 Turkey,
 and
 the
 UAE.
 US
 officials


said
 there's
 no
 plan
 to
 send
 American


troops
 into
 Gaza.
 Meanwhile,
 aid


organizations
 are
 also
 gearing
 up.
 The


United
 Nations
 is
 preparing
 to
 rush
 in


food,
 medicine,
 and
 other
 aid
 that's


desperately
 needed
 in
 the
 territory,


where
 many
 gazins
 are
 facing
 starvation,


and
 where
 basic
 services
 like
 medical


care
 and
 clean
 water
 have
 been


decimated.


For
 a
 behindthescenes
 look
 at
 how
 the


deal
 between
 Israel
 and
 Hamas
 finally


came
 together,
 and
 how
 President
 Trump's


son-in-law,
 Jared
 Kushner,
 played
 a


major
 role
 in
 that.
 Listen
 to
 today's


episode
 of
 The
 Daily
 with
 Times


investigative
 reporter
 Mark
 Misetti.


[Music]


Last
 night,
 Leticia
 James,
 the
 attorney


general
 of
 New
 York,
 was
 indicted
 on


charges
 of
 bank
 fraud
 after
 President


Trump
 demanded
 that
 she
 be
 prosecuted.


It's
 a
 striking
 escalation
 of
 a
 very


public
 yearslong
 conflict
 between
 the


two.
 Donald
 Trump
 may
 have
 authored
 the


art
 of
 the
 deal,
 but
 he
 perfected
 the


art
 of
 the
 steel.


It
 started
 in
 2018
 when
 James
 ran
 for


attorney
 general,
 vowing
 to
 investigate


Trump's
 financial
 dealings,
 which
 have


long
 been
 under
 scrutiny.


For
 years,
 Donald
 Trump
 engaged
 in


deceptive
 business
 practices
 and


tremendous
 fraud.
 After
 she
 was
 elected,


she
 quickly
 followed
 through,
 opening
 a


civil
 investigation
 into
 the
 Trump


Organization.
 And
 she
 followed
 it
 up


with
 a
 sweeping
 lawsuit
 that
 accused


Trump
 of
 fraudulently
 overstating
 his


wealth.


It's
 a
 witch
 hunt.
 We
 have
 a
 corrupt


attorney
 general
 in
 this
 state.
 You
 see


how
 she
 does?


The
 scale
 and
 the
 scope
 of
 Donald


Trump's
 fraud
 is
 staggering.


This
 is
 a
 disgrace.
 and
 you're
 to
 go


after
 this
 attorney
 general
 because


she's
 attorney.


From
 the
 first
 day
 of
 his
 trial
 in
 which


he
 was
 eventually
 found
 liable,
 Trump


vowed
 to
 go
 after
 her,
 calling
 James


corrupt.
 Since
 returning
 to
 office,
 he's


put
 intense
 pressure
 on
 prosecutors
 to


indict
 her.
 And
 ultimately,
 federal


investigators
 narrowed
 in
 on
 accusations


that
 she
 falsified
 financial
 records


when
 she
 purchased
 one
 of
 her
 homes.


James
 has
 called
 the
 charges
 baseless.


The
 indictment
 is
 the
 latest
 example
 of


how
 Trump
 has
 shattered
 presidential


norms
 by
 openly
 calling
 for
 the


government
 to
 go
 after
 his
 political


enemies.
 Along
 with
 James,
 his
 list
 of


top
 targets
 has
 included
 former
 FBI


Director
 James
 Comey,
 who
 pleaded
 not


guilty
 this
 week
 to
 charges
 of
 lying
 to


Congress.
 Trump
 has
 posted
 on
 social


media
 that
 they
 are
 both
 quote
 guilty
 as


hell
 and
 that
 justice
 must
 be
 served.


Notably,
 the
 indictments
 against
 James


and
 Comey
 were
 signed
 by
 just
 one


prosecutor,
 Lindseay
 Halligan,
 Trump's


former
 personal
 lawyer.
 He
 appointed
 her


to
 the
 position
 just
 last
 month
 after


other
 prosecutors
 raised
 doubts
 that


there
 was
 enough
 evidence
 to
 bring
 the


charges


[Music]


in
 Oslo
 this
 morning.
 The
 Nobel
 Peace


Prize
 for
 2025


goes
 to
 a
 brave
 and
 committed
 champion


of
 peace.
 To
 a
 woman
 who
 keeps
 the
 flame


of
 democracy
 burning
 amidst
 the
 growing


darkness.


The
 Nobel
 Committee
 announced
 that
 the


winner
 of
 this
 year's
 peace
 prize
 is


Maria
 Karina
 Machado,
 a
 pro-democracy


politician
 in
 Venezuela.
 She's
 been


living
 in
 hiding
 for
 the
 last
 year
 after


trying
 to
 rally
 voters
 against
 the


country's
 longtime
 authoritarian
 leader


Nicholas
 Maduro.
 The
 committee
 cited
 her


quote
 tireless
 work
 promoting
 democratic


rights
 for
 the
 people
 of
 Venezuela
 and


her
 struggle
 to
 achieve
 a
 just
 and


peaceful
 transition
 from
 dictatorship
 to


democracy.


Under
 the
 Maduro
 regime,
 authorities
 in


Venezuela
 have
 crushed
 protests
 and


arrested
 dissident.
 The
 country's
 been


plunged
 into
 an
 economic
 crisis
 and


there's
 been
 a
 mass
 exodus.
 In
 the
 last


few
 years,
 more
 than
 8
 million
 people


have
 fled
 the
 country.
 In
 recent
 months,


tensions
 between
 Venezuela
 and
 the
 US


have
 escalated
 as
 President
 Trump
 has


called
 Maduro's
 government
 a
 narot


terror
 cartel,
 and
 some
 of
 Trump's
 top


aids
 have
 discussed
 plans
 to
 try
 and


force
 Maduro
 out
 of
 power.


[Music]


And
 finally,
 so
 this
 is
 the
 record
 we


call
 it.
 It's
 in
 a
 storage
 facility.
 A


team
 of
 Times
 reporters
 recently


traveled
 to
 the
 world's
 northernmost


settlement
 on
 a
 cluster
 of
 islands
 near


the
 North
 Pole.
 It's
 a
 research
 station


in
 Spalbard,
 Norway.
 When
 they
 let
 you


on
 the
 ice,
 please
 stay
 away
 from
 the


ice
 edge


because
 uh
 the
 ice
 is
 often
 a
 bit


thinner
 at
 the
 ice
 edge.
 And


the
 team
 spent
 5
 days
 talking
 to


researchers
 stationed
 there
 where
 the


region
 is
 warming
 as
 much
 as
 seven
 times


faster
 than
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 planet.


That's
 because
 of
 a
 kind
 of
 feedback


loop.
 When
 ice
 melts,
 it
 exposes
 dark


seawater.
 Dark
 sea
 water
 absorbs
 more


heat,
 which
 melts
 more
 ice,
 and
 so
 on.


The
 scientists
 say
 those
 conditions
 in


Swalbard
 give
 them
 an
 early
 look
 at
 how


fast
 and
 how
 dramatically
 the
 changing


climate
 can
 change
 everything.


You
 see
 on
 this
 ice
 here,
 there's


actually
 very
 little
 snow.
 Uh
 it's
 only


uh
 in
 patches
 and
 a
 few
 cm.
 The


scientists
 are
 looking
 at
 how
 changing


weather
 patterns
 affects
 species
 living


in
 that
 environment
 and
 how
 they're


desperately
 trying
 to
 adapt
 to
 this


incredibly
 fastpaced
 change.
 So
 they're


looking
 at
 everything
 from


microorganisms


to
 polar
 bears.
 My
 colleague
 Sarah
 Herz


was
 one
 of
 the
 reporters
 on
 the
 trip.


She
 says
 that
 reindeer,
 for
 example,


used
 to
 roam
 widely
 across
 the


landscape,
 using
 frozen
 fjords
 to
 reach


better
 grazing
 grounds.
 Now,
 with
 the


ice
 melting,
 they've
 started
 to
 get
 cut


off
 and
 stranded,
 and
 they've
 begun


eating
 seaweed,
 which
 one
 researcher


described
 as
 survival
 food.
 The


scientists
 have
 also
 seen
 how
 polar


bears
 are
 having
 to
 adapt,
 which
 has


sometimes
 brought
 the
 bears
 and
 humans


uncomfortably
 close
 together
 as
 the


polar
 bears
 have
 moved
 more
 inland,
 even


raiding
 people's
 cabins
 in
 Swalbard.


Sarah
 says
 there's
 now
 even
 a
 brochure


for
 people
 who
 come
 to
 the
 remote


research
 station
 about
 what
 to
 do
 if
 you


come
 face
 to
 face
 with
 a
 polar
 bear.


Stay
 calm.
 Do
 not
 run,
 it
 says.
 And
 if


the
 bear
 charges,
 quote,
 be
 prepared
 to


use
 any
 possible
 deterrence,
 shovels,


ski
 poles,
 rocks,
 blocks
 of
 ice,
 water


in
 a
 thermos,
 etc.
 You
 can
 find
 videos


and
 pictures
 of
 life
 at
 the
 Spalbard


Research
 Station
 at

Those
 are
 the
 headlines,
 but
 if
 you


would
 like
 to
 play
 the
 Friday
 news
 quiz,


stick
 around.
 It's
 just
 up
 after
 these


credits.
 This
 show

Jarvis,
 Jessica
 Mezer,
 Yan
 Stewart,

Schuman.


Now,
 time
 for
 the
 quiz.
 Every
 week,
 we


ask
 you
 a
 few
 questions
 about
 stories


the
 Times
 has
 been
 covering.
 Can
 you


answer
 them
 all?
 First
 up,


will
 you
 get
 the
 Nobel
 Prize?
 Absolutely


not.
 They'll
 give
 it
 They'll
 give
 it
 to


some
 guy
 that
 didn't
 do
 a
 damn
 thing.


As
 mentioned,
 the
 Nobel
 Peace
 Prize
 was


announced
 this
 morning,
 and
 despite


President
 Trump
 openly
 campaigning
 for


it
 for
 his
 role
 mediating
 international


conflicts,
 he
 did
 not
 win
 it
 this
 year.


In
 total,
 four
 American
 presidents
 have


won
 it.
 Your
 question,
 how
 many
 can
 you


name?


Little
 hint,
 the
 committee
 only
 started


giving
 out
 the
 prize
 in
 the
 early
 1900s.


So
 you
 can
 scratch
 like
 the
 first
 25


presidents
 off
 the
 list.


The
 answer
 here
 they
 are.
 Teddy


Roosevelt
 won
 in
 1906
 for
 helping
 end


the
 RussoJapanese
 War.
 Woodro
 Wilson
 won


in
 1919
 for
 promoting
 world
 peace
 after


World
 War
 I.
 Jimmy
 Carter
 won
 in
 2002


for
 his
 decades
 of
 work
 promoting


democracy
 and
 human
 rights
 and
 Barack


Obama
 won
 in
 2009
 for
 what
 the
 Nobel


Prize
 Committee
 called
 his
 extraordinary


efforts
 to
 strengthen
 international


diplomacy
 and
 cooperation
 between


peoples.
 He
 was
 less
 than
 9
 months
 into


his
 first
 term
 when
 he
 won.
 And
 Obama


said
 when
 accepting
 it
 that
 he
 felt
 his


quote
 accomplishments
 were
 slight


compared
 to
 past
 winners.


[Music]


Next
 question.
 Oh
 my
 god.
 Okay,
 this
 is


exciting.
 I'm
 definitely
 going
 to
 buy


some
 more
 tickets.
 A
 bunch
 of
 tickets


for
 a
 big
 big
 big
 event
 just
 went
 on


sale
 this
 month.
 Even
 though
 it
 doesn't


happen
 until
 next
 year.


So,
 I
 won
 the
 lottery
 for
 the
 tickets.


I'm
 starting
 to
 get
 a
 little
 nervous.


People
 have
 been
 scrambling
 to
 get


seats.


Like,
 these
 ticket
 prices
 are
 crazy.
 If


these
 are
 the
 prices,
 ladies
 and


gentlemen,
 we're
 in
 trouble.


Your
 question,
 what
 event
 has
 caused
 all


of
 this
 ticket
 madness?


If
 you
 need
 a
 hint,
 the
 event
 is
 set
 to


be
 held
 in
 three
 countries:
 Canada,
 the


US,
 and
 Mexico.


The
 answer,
 the
 2026
 FIFA
 World
 Cup.
 A


lot
 of
 fans
 are
 not
 happy
 because
 FIFA


announced
 that
 unlike
 with
 past
 World


Cups,
 it's
 not
 capping
 the
 resale
 prices


this
 time
 for
 tickets
 in
 the
 US
 and


Canada.
 Critics
 say
 that
 has
 encouraged


scalpers
 to
 go
 wild
 and
 put
 the
 games


way
 out
 of
 reach
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 fans


price-wise.
 For
 example,
 a
 ticket
 to
 the


final
 match
 in
 the
 way
 upper
 corner
 of
 a


stadium
 in
 New
 Jersey
 jumped
 from
 about


$2,000
 originally
 to
 more
 than
 $25,000


just
 a
 day
 later
 on
 resale.
 So


basically,
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to


choose
 World
 Cup
 tickets
 or
 midsize


sedan.


And
 last
 question,


[Music]


Amazon,
 which
 earlier
 this
 year
 got


creative
 control
 of
 the
 James
 Bond


franchise,
 recently
 put
 out
 new
 artwork


to
 showcase
 the
 films
 on
 its
 streaming


service.
 But
 pretty
 quickly,
 Bond
 fans


noticed
 one
 big
 thing
 had
 been


photoshopped
 out
 of
 the
 promo
 images
 for


classics
 like
 Dr.
 No.
 Golden
 Eye
 and


Casino
 Royale.


Your
 question.
 What
 was
 scrubbed
 out?


I'll
 give
 you
 a
 little
 hint
 here.


007.
 Sir,
 just
 leave
 the
 Betta.


The
 answer.


I
 mean,
 you
 can't
 have
 James
 Bond


without
 guns.


No.


The
 new
 images
 were
 missing
 Bond's
 gun.


Fans
 quickly
 criticized
 Amazon
 for


cropping
 out
 or
 digitally
 removing
 the


weapons.


Sometimes
 I
 truly
 think
 streaming


services
 are
 out
 there
 to
 ruin


franchises.


The
 company
 didn't
 say
 why
 it
 made
 the


change,
 but
 it
 then
 reversed
 it
 after


the
 uproar.
 It
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of
 a


trend
 in
 recent
 years
 in
 which
 streaming


services
 have
 edited
 out
 guns,
 nudity,


and
 cigarettes
 from
 posters
 and
 even


from
 the
 movies
 themselves.
 These
 kinds


of
 digital
 tweaks
 aren't
 entirely
 new.


For
 a
 20th
 anniversary
 release
 of
 ET,


Steven
 Spielberg
 swapped
 out
 federal


agents
 guns
 for
 walkietalkies.


He
 later
 regretted
 that
 decision
 and
 put


the
 guns
 back
 in
 for
 the
 30th


anniversary.
 He
 said
 he
 realized
 that


movies
 are
 supposed
 to
 capture
 quote


where
 we
 were
 when
 we
 made
 them
 and
 what


the
 world
 was
 like.


That
 is
 it
 for
 this
 week's
 quiz.

 what

 Roosevelt


was
 up

 with
 the
 RussoJapanese
 War.

 Monday.
