hi
 everybody
 tune
 in
 to
 this
 short


version
 of
 the
 podcast
 which
 we
 do
 every


Friday
 for
 the
 long
 version
 tune
 in
 on


Wednesdays
 hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan


the
 CEO
 of
 noras
 Bank
 investment


management
 and
 today
 we're
 diving
 into


the
 Magical
 World
 of
 Disney
 a
 company


where
 we
 are
 the
 lucky
 owner
 or
 more


than
 1%
 and
 I'm
 here
 with
 Bob
 Iger
 the


Visionary
 leader
 who
 transformed
 Disney


into
 a
 global
 entertainment
 Powerhouse


leading
 Bold
 Acquisitions
 like
 Pixar


Marvel
 and
 21st
 century
 folks
 Bob
 warm


welcome


thank
 you
 very
 much
 nice
 to
 be
 here
 no
 I


think
 no
 other
 company
 has
 made
 so
 many


people
 laugh
 and
 cry
 over
 more
 than
 a


hundred
 years
 so
 in
 your
 mind
 what
 is
 it


that
 makes
 Disney
 so
 special
 well
 I


think
 first
 of
 all
 the
 fact
 that
 we've


touched
 people's
 hearts
 for
 as
 you
 cited


over
 a
 hundred
 years
 uh
 is
 Meaningful


because
 when
 you
 tell
 stories
 that
 have


the
 kind
 of
 effect
 that
 our
 stories
 have


on
 people
 uh
 they
 become
 memorable
 they


become
 you
 know
 part
 of
 the
 fabric
 of


people's
 lives
 uh
 and
 they're
 also


stories
 that
 are
 frequently
 shared
 with


other
 people
 so
 you
 have
 a
 basically
 a


number
 of
 people
 enjoying
 our
 stories


together
 and
 that
 also
 I
 think
 compounds


the
 impact
 of
 our
 storytelling
 uh
 We've


also
 you
 know
 managed
 to
 um
 stick
 to
 our


core
 values
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 really


important
 you
 know
 what
 you're
 going
 to


get
 when
 you
 see
 the
 name
 Disney
 on
 a


product
 and
 I
 think
 that
 goes
 a
 long
 way


to
 to
 enabling
 us
 to
 be
 relevant
 for


over
 a
 century
 why
 do
 you
 think
 we're


still
 so
 drawn
 to
 these
 imaginary
 worlds


well
 as
 Walt
 Disney
 used
 to
 say
 you
 know


people
 often
 uh
 like
 to
 uh
 e
 either


experience
 things
 or
 or
 or
 or
 hear


stories
 told
 that
 enables
 them
 to


essentially
 distance
 themselves
 from


kind
 of
 their
 daily
 lives
 and
 their


daily
 responsibilities
 there's
 a
 there's


an
 Escapist
 quality
 but
 I
 think
 in
 many


other
 respects
 with
 Disney
 story
 stories


you
 know
 there
 are
 there
 are
 things
 like


uh


relatability
 uh
 common
 experiences
 that


are
 reflected
 in
 our


storytelling
 uh
 there's
 the
 whole
 notion


of
 fantasy
 and
 igniting
 people's


imagination
 and
 creating
 magic
 um


there's
 also
 I
 think
 something
 that's


very
 very
 unique
 to
 Disney
 and
 that
 is


that
 we
 make
 things
 that
 can
 be
 uh


enjoyed
 by
 multiple
 Generations
 all
 at


once
 is
 that
 something
 you
 have
 to
 do


more
 and
 more
 to
 build
 in
 appealing


things
 for
 several
 Generations
 It
 just


strikes
 me
 when
 I
 watch
 you
 know
 things


like
 Finding
 Nemo
 you
 have
 built
 in
 so


many
 uh
 so
 many
 layers
 of
 complexity


that
 appeals
 to
 so
 many
 different
 type


of
 people
 you
 know
 we
 we
 try
 to


essentially
 tell
 stories
 that
 are
 as


accessible
 as
 possible
 and
 that
 best


reflect
 the
 world
 that
 uh
 we
 are
 telling


stories
 to
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 really


quite


critical
 now
 you
 say
 things
 like
 dream


big
 anything
 can
 happen
 now
 uh
 these
 are


uh
 in
 a
 way
 uh
 quite
 American
 values
 do


you
 think
 the
 company
 could
 ever
 have


been
 founded
 in
 Europe
 what
 was
 inspired


is
 some
 of
 his
 earliest
 greatest
 stories


were
 inspired
 by
 the
 great
 European


storytellers
 of
 the
 brothers
 grim
 and
 H


Christian
 Anderson
 for
 instance
 so
 I
 I


think
 he
 had
 a
 respect
 he
 he
 also
 he


liked
 to
 travel
 and
 he
 traveled
 around


Europe
 and
 in
 many
 respects
 some
 things


that
 he
 built
 at
 Disneyland
 came
 from


his
 inspiration
 the
 inspiration
 that
 he


got
 through
 trael


um
 and
 learning
 about
 cultures
 and


learning
 about
 places
 and
 and
 wanting


the
 world
 to
 feel
 like
 a
 one
 world


instead
 of
 a
 basically
 a
 a
 world
 that


was
 you
 know
 completely
 completely


broken
 up
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 managing


creative
 genuses
 empathy
 is
 the
 biggest


key
 um
 you
 have
 to
 understand
 that
 uh


when
 a
 Creator
 um
 has
 has
 pitched
 you
 a


great
 story
 and
 and
 you've
 given
 them


the
 ability
 to
 go
 out
 and
 tell
 that


story
 you've
 given
 them
 the
 resources


the
 the
 the
 money
 the
 tools
 the
 place
 to


tell
 that
 story
 um
 that
 story
 is
 often


coming
 from
 within
 them
 it's
 a
 passion


of
 theirs
 it
 is
 the
 invention
 of
 their


own
 mind
 and
 their
 own
 heart
 and
 you


have
 to
 understand
 then
 just
 how


delicate
 it
 is
 to
 to
 manage
 someone
 who


is
 essentially
 um
 creating
 something


that
 comes
 from
 within
 them
 that
 is


inherently
 theirs
 uh
 and
 while
 we
 have
 a


responsibility
 on
 behalf
 of
 the
 company


to
 make
 sure
 that
 they're
 telling
 their


stories
 right
 and
 and
 and
 and
 they're


pursuing
 the
 extent
 possible
 of


perfection
 in
 terms
 of
 Storytelling
 and


that
 sometimes
 requires
 us
 to
 lean
 on


them
 more
 in
 order
 to
 get
 the
 results


that
 we
 want
 you
 have
 to
 always
 do
 so
 by


putting
 yourself
 in
 their


shoes
 now
 you've
 been
 first
 at
 ABC
 but


then
 in
 the
 whole
 kind
 of
 Disney
 company


for
 50
 years
 are
 you
 able
 to
 predict


what's
 going
 to
 be
 good
 or
 bad
 and
 and


and
 then
 when
 was
 the
 last
 time
 you
 were


really
 surprised
 either
 that
 something


failed
 that
 you
 thought
 was
 going
 to
 be


fantastic
 or
 the
 opposite
 occasionally
 I


see
 something
 that's
 really
 good
 that


ends
 up
 surprising
 me
 on
 the
 upside


because
 it
 resonates
 a
 lot
 more
 than


even
 I
 thought
 it
 might
 for
 some
 reason


um
 that
 happens
 more
 often
 than
 the


opposite
 than
 seeing
 something
 that


failed
 where
 I
 didn't
 think
 it
 would


fail
 but
 as
 we
 get
 as
 we
 get
 older
 are


we
 are
 we
 Less
 in
 tune
 with
 with
 the


general
 public
 well
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 we
 get
 paid
 to
 do
 in
 these
 jobs
 is


to
 stay
 in
 tune
 I
 guess
 you
 could
 argue


that
 the
 older
 you
 get
 the
 harder
 it
 is


a
 good


executive
 meaning
 good
 at
 managing


creativity
 and
 good


at
 enabling


creators


um
 has
 done
 a
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 to
 keep


their
 finger
 on
 kind
 of
 the
 pulse
 of
 the


world
 and
 while
 I
 don't
 consider
 myself


the
 world's
 greatest
 expert
 on
 today's


culture
 I
 certainly
 have
 a
 number
 of


touch
 points
 into
 the
 culture
 that


enable
 me
 to
 understand
 and
 appreciate


it


more
 how
 important
 is
 energy
 uh
 because


um
 you
 you
 are
 up
 uh
 is
 it
 right
 you're


up
 just
 after
 4
 o'clock
 every
 every
 day


yes
 that's
 correct
 so
 what
 do
 you
 do
 you


wake
 up
 you
 put
 on
 your
 dressing
 G
 you


go
 down
 to
 the
 kitchen
 and
 make
 a
 cup
 of


coffee
 or
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you
 do
 I


usually
 I
 it's
 funny
 I
 I
 I've
 reversed


this
 since
 I
 I
 came
 back
 to
 Disney
 I


have
 a
 cup
 of
 coffee
 first
 yes
 I
 go
 down


to
 the
 kitchen
 set
 the
 coffee
 maker
 in


the
 night
 before
 so
 there's
 a
 timer
 I


have
 my
 coffee
 and
 then
 I
 put
 on
 my


workout
 clothes
 and
 I
 work
 out
 at
 the


house
 um
 almost
 every
 day
 or
 and
 I
 do


the
 same
 thing
 when
 I'm
 in
 a
 hotel


anywhere
 in
 the
 world
 how
 long
 do
 you


how
 long
 do
 you
 work
 out
 for
 I
 work
 out


for
 about
 an
 hour
 every
 morning
 wow
 um


sometimes
 less
 but
 but
 rarely
 less
 than


45
 minutes
 um


and
 it's
 again
 I
 I
 I
 like
 to
 say
 that


it's
 for
 sanity
 and
 vanity
 purposes
 um


it
 enables
 me
 as
 I
 said
 to
 clear
 my
 head


but
 I
 also
 you
 know
 enables
 and
 and


better
 prepare
 my
 mind
 and
 my
 body
 for


the
 for
 the
 job
 at
 hand
 but
 you
 know


there's
 a
 van
 there's
 a
 vanity
 side
 to


it


too
 now
 um
 some
 listeners
 may
 not
 know


but
 um
 you
 were
 uh
 as
 CEO
 for
 15
 years


uh
 you
 stepped
 down
 in
 2020
 came
 back


after
 two
 years
 years
 um
 now
 when
 you


came
 back
 and
 looked
 at
 Disney
 again


what
 were
 your
 priorities
 then
 well


Disney
 had
 been
 through
 a
 really


difficult
 time
 uh
 obviously
 U
 the
 board


making
 a
 decision
 to
 remove
 the
 the


former
 CEO
 you
 know
 created
 not
 just


uncertainty
 but
 a
 real
 concern
 so
 I
 I


had
 to
 calm
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 had
 to
 do


was
 really
 calm
 things
 down
 and
 and


reassure
 people
 um
 that
 that
 that
 the


future
 was
 bright
 again
 and
 that
 there


were
 steps
 we
 were
 going
 to
 take
 that
 I


would
 was
 going
 to
 be
 very
 transparent


about
 to
 uh
 get
 Disney
 back
 on
 track
 uh


I
 I
 believe
 at
 company's
 culture
 is


everything
 in
 many
 respects
 and
 a
 a


culture
 that
 uh
 respects
 and
 and
 fosters


great
 creativity
 particularly
 at
 Disney


is
 is
 critical
 I
 had
 to
 return


creativity
 to
 the
 center
 of
 the
 company


it
 had
 the
 company
 had
 been
 restructured


in
 a
 way
 that
 took
 some
 of
 the


accountability
 and
 responsibility
 away


from
 the
 creat
 side
 of
 the
 company
 I
 had


to
 restore
 that
 I
 did
 that
 on
 day
 one


really
 right
 away
 um
 I
 had
 to
 instill


optimism
 again
 in
 the
 company
 being
 a


realist
 in
 how
 many
 things
 we
 need
 to


accomplish
 but
 being
 an
 optimist
 in


terms
 of
 my
 confidence
 that
 we
 would
 be


able
 to
 accomplish
 those
 things
 um
 I


also
 had
 to
 streamline
 the
 organization


make
 it
 much
 more
 clear
 who
 was


responsible
 for
 for
 what
 uh
 there
 was


there
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 fixing
 that
 had


to
 be
 done
 what
 was
 the
 toughest
 part
 of


it
 the
 toughest
 part
 for
 me
 was
 to
 be


patient
 I
 had
 to
 get
 used
 to
 the
 fact


that
 um
 The
 Climb
 upwards
 wasn't
 as


certain
 wasn't
 as
 easy
 uh
 and
 that
 we


were
 starting
 from
 a
 very
 low
 point
 and


I
 had
 to
 be
 patient
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 long


it
 would
 take
 to
 get
 where
 I
 felt
 the


company
 needed
 to
 be
 I
 actually
 feel


quite
 good
 now
 about
 where
 we
 are
 we


have
 a
 lot
 more
 work
 to
 do
 and
 Heavens


even
 if
 we'
 fixed
 everything
 there
 still


will
 be
 work
 to
 do
 but
 I
 feel
 really


good
 about
 not
 only
 the
 recent
 successes


um
 and
 what
 we've
 managed
 to
 accomplish


as
 a
 company
 to
 date
 but
 I
 feel
 great


about
 the
 trajectory
 of
 our
 company


going
 forward
 is
 it
 difficult
 for
 a


perfectionist
 to
 be
 patient
 it's
 almost


impossible
 for
 a
 perfectionist
 to
 be


patient
 that
 is
 one
 of
 my
 that
 is
 one
 of


my
 personal
 struggles
 I
 think
