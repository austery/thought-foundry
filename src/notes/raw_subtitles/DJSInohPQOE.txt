[Music]


well
 thank
 you
 uh
 for
 having
 me
 the
 so


when
 I
 think
 about
 our
 philosophy
 right


and
 this
 is
 really
 about
 the
 philosophy


that
 gets
 you
 to
 be
 excellent
 Excellence


is
 so
 core
 to
 us
 and
 as
 I
 go
 through
 the


different
 words
 that
 define
 our
 our
 um


our
 philosophy
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 trying


to
 really
 focus
 on
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 a


buzzword
 like
 excellence
 and
 for
 us
 we


measure
 Excellence
 by
 what
 we
 mean
 by
 it


is
 continuous
 Improvement
 everybody


starts
 somewhere
 and
 the
 question
 is
 can


you
 as
 an
 individual
 and
 you
 as
 an


organization
 continuously
 improve
 that's


what
 we
 would
 Define
 as
 excellent
 and
 so


if
 I
 start
 with
 what
 um
 see
 if
 I
 got


this


here
 um
 what
 are
 we
 trying
 to
 be


excellent
 at
 and
 Bridge
 has
 been
 been


doing
 two
 things
 for
 its
 whole
 existence


50
 years
 I've
 been
 a
 bridgew
 for
 29


years
 and
 we
 focus
 on
 two
 things
 which


is
 to
 deeply
 understand
 how
 the
 economic


system
 works
 and
 apply
 that
 to
 build


great
 portfolios
 so
 we're
 trying
 as
 an


organization
 to
 be
 excellent
 at
 that


which
 means
 to
 continuously
 improve
 that


and
 there's
 three
 components
 that
 are


critical
 um
 to
 really
 understand
 our


philosophy
 one
 is
 what
 we
 mean
 by


fundamental
 so
 fundamental
 means
 what


actually
 drives
 markets
 that
 we
 believe


that
 you
 can
 that
 you
 can
 understand


this


that
 there
 are
 decisions
 that
 people


make
 they
 make
 them
 for
 reasons
 those


reasons
 add
 up
 to
 what
 we
 consider
 the


fundamentals
 that
 um
 that
 those
 ideas


can
 be
 you
 can
 think
 of
 them


qualitatively
 they're
 not
 like
 not


everything
 that
 you're
 thinking
 matters


is
 measurable
 in
 a
 traditional


qualitative
 sense
 but
 in
 any
 event


that's
 what
 we
 mean
 by
 fundamental
 which


is
 what
 are
 the
 true
 causes
 for
 the


things
 that
 you
 see
 in
 the
 world
 and


then
 the
 second
 step
 that
 we
 take
 is
 to


take
 whatever
 you
 believe
 and
 systemize


it
 what
 we
 mean
 by
 that
 is
 have
 the


rigor
 to
 take
 the
 reason
 that's
 in
 your


brain
 right
 it
 could
 be
 a
 qualitative


idea
 but
 there
 is
 a
 reason
 the
 synapses


in
 your
 brain
 are
 doing
 what
 they're


doing
 and
 somehow
 there
 are
 inputs


coming
 in
 there's
 logic
 being
 applied
 to


those
 inputs
 and
 outputs
 coming
 out
 you


can
 take
 the
 energy
 to
 systemize
 that


understanding
 and
 it's
 critical
 I'll


talk
 about
 why
 that
 for
 us
 anyway
 that's


so
 important
 and
 the
 last
 thing
 is
 is


have
 a
 strategy
 for
 being
 wrong
 our


strategy
 for
 being
 wrong
 is
 diversifying


but
 there's
 different
 strategies
 but
 you


need
 to
 know
 that
 whatever
 you
 believe


with
 whatever
 confidence
 you're
 going
 to


be
 wrong
 a
 tremendous
 amount
 so
 those


are
 the
 three
 kind
 of
 core
 things
 I'll


dig
 a
 little
 bit
 deeper


on
 so
 first
 off
 what
 could
 we
 mean
 by


fundamental
 what
 are
 truths
 that
 when
 we


try
 to
 discover
 what's
 true
 about


markets
 and
 economies
 they're
 things


that
 are
 going
 to
 be
 true
 now
 that
 are


true
 wherever
 you
 place
 yourself
 in
 the


world
 that
 are
 true
 at
 any
 moment
 in


history
 we
 expect
 to
 be
 true
 at
 any


moment
 in
 the
 future
 me
 the
 first
 one
 of


those
 things
 we'd
 start
 with
 is
 that


there's
 two
 ways
 two
 core
 ways
 to
 make


money
 in


markets
 one
 is
 to
 take
 on
 risk
 that's
 a


risk
 transfer
 to
 you
 that
 somebody's


offering
 to
 pay
 you
 because
 you're
 in
 a


position
 to
 take
 risk
 they
 don't
 want
 to


take
 right
 that's
 what
 that
 General


category
 we
 call
 that
 beta
 not
 to
 be
 too


like
 they
 semantic
 arguments
 about
 what


beta
 means
 but
 for
 us
 we
 just
 mean
 the


the
 amount
 of
 money
 you
 get
 paid
 for


taking
 on
 something
 else's
 risk
 then


there's
 a
 separate
 point
 which
 is
 Alpha


which
 is
 the
 money
 you
 get
 you
 can
 make


by
 making
 smart
 decisions
 in
 terms
 of


timing
 in
 terms
 of
 valuation
 Etc
 that
 go


beyond
 just
 taking
 on
 the
 risk
 so
 that


we
 think
 about
 trying
 to
 separate
 that


and
 think
 of
 every
 um
 investment
 as
 the


risk
 neutral
 position
 plus
 the
 beta
 so


what
 the
 asset
 classes
 are
 that
 you
 hold


and
 the
 risk
 that
 you're
 transferring


plus
 the
 alpha
 that's
 very
 different
 the


way
 we
 look
 at
 it
 that
 sort
 of
 formula


of
 how
 you
 get
 a
 total
 portfolio
 return


is
 different
 than
 how
 most
 organizations


structure
 their
 Investments
 most


organizations
 think
 of
 their
 total


return
 as
 their
 their
 Holdings
 in
 each


asset
 class
 Holdings
 in
 stocks
 Holdings


in
 bonds
 Holdings
 in
 private
 Equity
 etc


etc
 and
 those
 sum
 up
 right
 and
 the


difference
 is
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 combine


your
 Alpha
 with
 your
 beta
 you
 can


separate
 those
 two
 decisions
 and
 that's


a
 big
 deal
 so
 first
 of
 understanding


those
 two
 return
 streams
 recognizing


they're
 different
 and
 the
 way
 you
 can


combine
 them
 together
 can
 actually


significantly
 improve
 how
 you


invest
 so
 now
 when
 we
 come
 back
 to


fundamentals
 and
 we
 think
 about
 what
 are


fundamentals
 that
 are
 Timeless
 and


Universal
 what
 can
 you
 say
 about
 markets


that's
 going
 to
 be
 true
 100
 years
 from


now
 is
 true
 in
 China
 it's
 true
 in
 the


United
 States
 it's
 true
 here
 in
 Norway


um
 because
 you
 really
 want
 to
 base
 your


beliefs
 on
 things
 that
 are
 fundamentally


true
 and
 then
 build
 out
 the
 deep


understanding
 about
 those
 things
 so
 to


give
 you
 two
 examples
 of
 what
 we
 mean
 by


things
 that
 are
 Timeless
 and
 Universal


that
 the
 first
 is
 that
 the
 price
 of


anything
 is
 equal
 to
 the
 amount
 of


currency
 spent
 on
 it
 divided
 by
 its


quantity
 right
 that
 seems
 simple
 but


it's
 actually
 a
 world
 of
 understanding


to
 say
 well
 how
 much
 money
 is
 going
 to


be
 spent
 on
 something
 how
 much
 supply
 of


it
 exists
 right
 and
 you
 can


fundamentally
 build
 that
 you
 can
 build


that
 in
 any
 time
 in
 any
 country
 um
 and


I'll
 get
 into
 how
 we
 check
 that
 that


those
 things
 are
 true
 anywhere
 similarly


the
 price
 of
 something
 is
 equal
 to
 the


discounted
 economic
 conditions
 that


affect
 it
 and
 so
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


changes
 in
 prices
 it's
 because
 something


happens
 relative
 to
 the
 discounted


economic
 conditions
 in
 that
 asset
 those


two
 things
 are
 true
 all
 the
 time
 and


everywhere
 and
 those
 are
 big
 building


blocks
 to
 then
 build
 a
 process
 around
 so


when
 we've
 been
 building
 processes
 to


measure


that
 to
 measure
 those
 cause
 effect


linkages
 of
 things
 that
 we
 believe
 to
 be


true
 um
 you
 know
 really
 starting
 in
 1980


so
 the
 first
 thing
 I'd
 say
 now
 we
 talk


about
 making
 decisions
 systematically


why
 do
 you
 do
 this
 it's
 so
 such
 a
 pain


right
 why
 do
 I
 have
 to
 write
 down
 what
 I


believe
 why
 do
 I
 have
 to
 stress
 test


whether
 it's
 true
 I
 mean
 most
 people


want
 to
 skip
 that
 step
 because
 it's
 like


okay
 it
 seems
 like
 this
 is
 going
 to


happen
 or
 that's
 going
 to
 happen
 and


it's
 been
 such
 a


huge
 uh
 building
 block
 in
 our


organization
 to
 say
 no
 we're
 going
 to


have
 the
 discipline
 to
 always
 write
 down


our
 reasoning
 right
 so
 when
 we
 talk


about
 making
 decisions
 systematically


this
 is
 not
 a
 quantitative
 thing
 this
 is


about
 having
 the
 discipline
 to
 say
 this


is
 why
 I'm
 doing
 what
 I'm
 doing
 that


opens
 up
 a
 world
 so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


yellow
 piece
 of
 paper
 that's
 up
 there


that
 was
 our
 1980
 Bond
 system
 so
 in


1980
 you
 can
 picture
 Bridgewater
 it
 was


yellow
 piece
 of
 paper
 rules
 that
 were


written
 out
 this
 is
 we're
 going
 to
 buy


bonds
 if
 this
 happens
 we're
 going
 to


sell
 bonds
 if
 that
 happens
 that
 were


rules
 about
 what
 thought
 about
 money


supply
 and
 other
 things
 at
 the
 time
 um


the
 idea
 itself
 is
 not
 that
 useful
 but


the
 process
 that
 it
 kicked
 off
 was


critical


which
 is
 we
 just
 scratched
 out
 one
 of


those
 ideas
 put
 in
 another
 one
 learned


another
 one
 but
 you
 start
 with
 this


building
 block
 of
 what
 do
 you
 believe
 so


that
 others
 in
 the


organization
 can
 question
 that
 it's


forcing
 you
 to
 actually
 State
 what
 your


logic
 is
 and
 um
 and
 that
 allows
 constant


compound
 Improvement
 that's
 really
 such


a
 critical
 element
 to
 our
 philosophy
 and


and


um


the
 benefit
 of
 that
 is
 you
 can
 check


your
 yourself
 so
 what
 I'm
 showing
 here


is
 just
 an
 example
 if
 you
 if
 you
 said


okay
 let
 me
 say
 what
 I
 think
 right
 right


now
 you
 might
 think
 well
 the
 um
 capacity


utilization
 in
 the
 United
 States
 like


the
 economy
 is
 running
 hot
 and
 that


running
 hot
 could
 lead
 to
 um
 higher


wages
 and
 maybe
 higher
 inflation
 and


therefore
 I
 want
 to
 take
 this
 position


in
 markets
 right
 and
 the
 great
 thing


about
 forcing
 yourself
 to
 okay
 that


seems
 reasonable
 like
 let's
 write
 it


down
 let's
 see
 if
 that's
 true
 when
 is
 it


true
 if
 you
 use
 that
 rule
 will
 it


actually
 work
 in
 history
 right
 force


yourself
 through
 that
 put
 yourself
 at


different
 points
 in
 time
 that'll
 force


you
 to
 refine
 your
 thinking
 right
 if
 you


just
 take
 that
 idea
 that's
 like
 just


something
 i'
 you
 know
 recently
 heard
 a


fair
 amount
 so
 I
 just
 wrote
 it
 down
 so


it
 could
 show
 and
 then
 you
 could
 you


know
 have
 technology
 to
 just
 test
 okay


well
 let's
 say
 you
 follow
 that
 rule
 does


it
 work
 or
 not
 and
 what
 you
 find
 most
 of


the
 time
 is
 actually
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 it


doesn't
 work
 so
 now
 you
 think
 well
 I


must
 not
 know
 what
 I'm
 saying
 isn't
 that


reliable
 right
 and
 I
 show
 like
 a
 profit


curve
 of
 the
 alpha
 of
 that
 rule
 and
 is


actually
 okay
 for
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time


and
 then
 flat
 for
 the
 last
 35
 years
 why


would
 that
 be
 why
 is
 that
 getting
 priced


into
 markets
 what's
 going
 on
 right
 and


the
 benefit
 of
 writing
 down
 your
 rules


is
 you
 can
 actually
 see
 whether
 they


work
 um
 and
 that's
 a
 huge
 huge
 deal


beyond
 that
 you
 can
 also
 know
 what


you're
 in


for
 for
 every
 idea
 that
 we
 ever
 use
 to


invest
 we
 start
 with
 what
 do
 we
 expect


from
 it
 right
 and
 so
 this
 cone
 chart


illustrates
 this
 but
 every
 idea
 that
 we


use
 in
 investing
 we
 say
 okay
 what
 are


the
 risk
 and
 the
 return
 that
 we
 expect


from
 this
 idea
 in
 the


future
 and
 that
 gives
 us
 a
 uh
 an


opportunity
 to
 then
 compare
 what
 happens


relative
 to
 that
 right
 so
 the
 cone
 chart


is
 when
 we
 first
 started
 the
 idea
 so
 in


1991
 as
 an
 example
 we
 started
 the
 idea


of
 of
 pure
 Alpha
 which
 is
 all
 of
 the


alpha
 ideas
 we
 had
 at
 the
 time
 put


together
 and
 then
 we've
 added
 to
 them


and
 subtracted
 from
 them
 but
 um
 and
 we


set
 out
 a
 cone
 chart
 and
 said
 this
 is


what
 we
 expect
 the
 risk
 return
 to
 look


like
 into
 the
 future
 and
 every
 day
 we


Mark
 what's
 happening
 relative
 to
 that


expectation
 right
 and
 we
 do
 that
 with


every
 single
 idea
 which
 is
 automatic


quality
 control
 you
 could
 say
 okay
 if
 my


idea
 doesn't
 work
 out
 consistent
 with


how
 I
 expected
 it
 to
 then
 okay
 the


world's
 different
 than
 what
 I
 thought


and
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 if
 there
 are
 draw


Downs
 in
 that
 idea
 which
 there
 always


will
 be
 you
 plan
 for
 it
 in
 advance


you're
 not
 reacting
 to
 that
 draw
 down


you're
 saying
 okay
 if
 I
 have
 a
 draw
 down


of
 this
 nature
 I'm
 not


perplexed
 by
 it
 because
 I
 knew
 it
 would


happen
 I
 expected
 that
 to
 happen
 um
 so


knowing
 what's
 inside
 the
 bounds
 of
 what


you
 expect
 and
 what's
 not
 is
 another


critical


element
 now
 the
 next
 point
 is
 probably


the
 one
 that's
 most
 sort
 of
 Under
 Fire


at
 this
 point
 in
 history
 because


diversification
 hasn't
 been
 doing
 that


great
 as
 a
 concept
 but
 but
 um
 if
 we


thought
 about
 the
 Holy
 Grail
 of


investing
 right
 what
 do
 we
 actually
 want


if
 you
 want
 to
 achieve
 your
 goals
 in


investing
 um
 it's
 to
 have
 something
 like


15
 to
 20
 uncorrelated
 return
 streams


this
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 we're
 seeking
 you


never
 actually
 get
 there
 because
 things


are
 too
 correlated
 to
 quite
 get
 to
 that


level
 but
 if
 you
 you're
 seeking
 ways


that
 you
 can
 make
 money
 in
 markets
 that


are
 unrelated
 right
 and
 and
 the
 benefit


of
 that
 is
 you
 can
 translate
 if
 you


basically
 look
 at
 this
 chart
 most
 things


if
 you
 take
 most
 of
 the
 Investments
 that


you're
 all
 invested
 in
 are
 reasonably


highly
 correlated
 they're
 on
 the
 top


left
 that
 means
 you
 can
 buy
 a
 whole


bunch
 of
 them
 you're
 not
 actually


getting
 much
 diversification
 if
 you
 see


this
 curve
 if
 you're
 able
 to
 select


strategies
 that
 are
 uncorrelated
 and
 you


can
 move
 down
 that
 curve
 you
 can
 improve


your
 reliability
 3
 five
 x
 with
 equally


good
 ideas
 if
 you're
 getting


uncorrelated
 ones
 um
 so
 that
 is
 really


that
 seeking
 that
 search
 for
 H
 what
 are


our
 paths
 to
 get
 positively
 expected


returns
 that
 are
 um
 uncorrelated
 to
 each


other
 so
 that's
 again
 a
 huge
 hugely


important
 part
 of
 our


philosophy
 and
 to
 do


that
 what
 you
 need
 is
 to
 to
 put
 them


together
 in
 a
 way
 that
 actually
 works
 so


when
 you
 do
 balancing
 and
 diversifying


in
 terms
 of


risk
 instead
 of
 in
 Terms
 of
 capital
 is


so
 critical
 so
 it's
 usually
 people
 think


in
 terms
 of
 okay
 I'm
 going
 to
 invest
 X


in
 this
 asset
 why
 and
 this
 asset
 Etc
 in


capital


terms
 restructuring
 your
 thinking
 to


think
 in
 terms
 of
 I'm
 going
 to
 allocate


risk
 to
 different
 things
 and
 then
 I'm


going
 to
 try
 to
 balance
 that
 risk
 among


things
 that
 are
 diversifying
 so
 that


means
 you
 have
 to
 take
 high
 risk


strategies
 and
 lower
 the
 risk
 on
 them


and
 take
 low
 risk
 strategies
 and
 raise


the
 risk
 on
 them
 in
 order
 to
 get


diversification
 across
 them
 right
 and


that's
 a
 another
 attribute
 of
 when
 we're


thinking
 about


diversifying
 now
 to
 slow
 down
 a


second
 um


just
 to
 put
 that
 into
 practice
 right
 so


when
 you
 think
 about
 the


concepts
 that
 are
 behind
 pure


Alpha
 that
 is
 sort
 of
 the
 the
 best
 we


could
 do
 in
 generating
 Alpha
 in
 the


world
 the
 concepts
 start
 with
 the
 deep


understanding
 of
 the
 world
 having


studied
 everything
 that
 exists
 in
 the


world
 that
 we
 could
 think
 of
 for
 50


years
 taking
 that
 yellow
 piece
 of
 paper


Crossing
 out
 things
 we
 don't
 like
 adding


things
 we
 learn
 building
 those
 into


algor
 Ms
 that
 reflect
 everything
 that


we've
 ever
 thought
 of
 right
 this
 kind
 of


gives
 you
 a
 sense
 of
 how
 that
 literally


works
 so
 it
 starts
 with
 different
 ideas


on
 the
 left
 here
 that
 a
 you'll
 have


different
 approaches
 to
 trading
 the


market
 this
 is
 Again
 part
 of


diversifying
 right
 you
 might
 think
 in


terms
 of
 fundamental
 principle
 of
 value


that
 eventually
 that
 that
 the
 cash
 flow


of
 an
 asset
 is
 going
 to
 equal


the
 the
 present
 value
 of
 all
 the
 future


returns
 that
 you'll
 get
 you
 could
 make


build
 that
 deep
 understanding
 of
 what


causes
 that
 what
 what
 an
 asset
 should
 be


worth
 today
 right
 that
 could
 be
 one


perspective
 on
 that
 market
 that
 isn't


going
 to
 help
 you
 that
 much
 in
 the
 next


6
 to
 18
 months
 it
 helps
 to
 some
 degree


it
 won't
 help
 you
 that
 much
 so
 you
 need


other
 perspectives
 well
 what
 are
 the


other
 drivers
 Beyond
 value
 right
 we


think
 of
 the
 essentially
 the
 movement
 in


the
 fundamental
 conditions
 that
 matter


so
 how
 do
 you
 measure
 those
 how
 do
 you


build
 that
 into
 a
 decision
 role
 we
 also


think
 about
 the
 effect
 that
 other


markets
 have
 on
 that
 particular
 Market


again
 how
 do
 you
 build
 that
 World
 out


how
 why
 do
 other
 markets
 affect
 this


Market
 how
 does
 that
 actually
 work
 and


then
 the
 fourth
 thing
 is
 who
 all
 the


buyers
 and
 sellers
 are
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 things
 go
 far
 from
 fair


value
 is
 because
 buyers
 and
 sellers
 do


things
 for
 reasons
 other
 than
 the


long-term
 cash
 flow
 effect
 and


understanding
 the
 balance
 sheets
 of


those
 players
 where
 they
 get
 their
 money


from
 how
 that
 works
 those
 pieces
 all


combined
 together
 and
 you
 could
 think
 of


it
 as
 we
 have
 all
 of
 those
 ideas
 that


we've
 been
 working
 on
 for
 years
 you
 can


think
 of
 it
 as
 four
 people
 arguing
 with


each
 other
 with
 different
 perspectives


on
 markets
 that
 then
 put
 together
 to
 get


to
 a
 view
 in
 a
 market
 which
 is
 kind
 of


then
 the
 thing
 that's
 on
 the
 second
 the


the
 next
 diagram
 here
 on
 the
 chart
 which


is
 okay
 you
 could
 translate
 those


different


people's
 views
 into
 a
 systematic
 process


those
 build
 that
 systematic
 process
 to


combine
 that
 information
 into
 one
 view


of
 a


market
 right
 so
 then
 we
 take
 that
 second


step
 then
 we
 take
 those
 signals
 that
 we


combined
 together
 and
 build
 that
 into
 a


risk
 pie
 so
 say
 okay
 well
 how
 much
 risk


do
 we
 want
 to
 put
 on
 each
 one
 of
 those


strategies
 how
 much
 risk
 would
 we
 put
 in


each
 one
 of
 the
 markets
 again
 trying
 to


move
 ourselves
 as
 much
 as
 possible
 to


the
 Holy
 Grail
 of
 15
 or
 20
 uncorrelated


return


streams
 and
 um
 that's
 then
 the
 pie
 chart


shows
 the
 risk
 budget
 we
 try
 to
 get
 over


time
 which
 is
 a
 very
 balanced
 risk


budget
 across
 many
 different
 markets


across
 very
 many
 different
 strategies


across
 those
 markets
 but
 at
 a
 point
 in


time
 which
 is
 then
 the
 furthest
 right


chart
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 views
 on


everything
 that's
 another
 big
 important


philosophical
 thing
 is
 you
 don't
 have
 to


have
 a
 view
 on
 everything
 you
 have
 this


world
 of
 opportunities
 to
 take
 advantage


of
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 have
 a
 view
 on


everything
 so
 translating
 your
 views
 at


a
 point
 in
 time
 that
 things
 that
 you


have
 strong
 views
 on
 through
 a
 risk


budget
 that's
 at
 a
 crosstime
 risk
 budget


you
 can
 sort
 of
 multiply
 the
 signal
 by


the
 risk
 budget
 to
 get
 the
 overall


portfolio
 that
 you
 end
 up
 with
 um
 so


that's
 how
 we
 kind
 of
 put
 these
 pieces


together
 in
 an
 approach
 that
 starts
 with


qualitative
 thinking
 about
 from
 experts


on
 like
 why
 would
 you
 buy
 a
 bond
 why


would
 you
 buy
 a
 currency
 etc
 etc


Translating
 that
 quality
 qualitative


thinking
 interrogating
 it
 until
 you


could
 translate
 it
 into
 an


algorithm
 using
 those
 algorithms
 to
 look


everywhere
 in
 the
 world
 so
 you
 could
 be


massively
 Diversified
 because
 now
 you
 if


you've
 actually
 taken
 the
 logic
 of
 why


would
 you
 buy
 a
 bond
 why
 would
 you
 buy
 a


currency
 you
 could
 apply
 that
 anywhere


in
 the
 world
 if
 you've
 done
 done
 it
 well


and
 deeply
 you
 can
 apply
 it
 everywhere


so
 you
 can
 apply
 those
 rules
 while


you're
 not
 even
 realizing
 something's


happening
 in
 a
 country
 or
 whatever
 and


um
 you
 could
 build
 up
 your
 Port
 build


out
 a
 portfolio
 that
 way
 measuring
 point


and
 time
 conditions
 reflecting
 all
 that


logic
 that
 you've
 built
 up
 over
 50
 years


of
 compounding
 right
 and
 that's
 kind
 of


the
 last
 point
 that
 I'd
 say
 if
 you
 just


talk
 about
 our
 philosophy
 it
 starts
 with


constant
 Improvement
 and
 if
 you
 actually


do
 constant
 Improvement
 as
 an


organization


and
 you


compound
 compound
 that
 understanding


right
 you
 think
 about
 compound
 returns


in
 the
 context
 of
 an
 investment
 if
 you


think
 of
 it
 in
 terms
 of
 an


organization
 what
 you
 really
 want
 to
 do


is
 compound
 understanding
 like
 what
 does


the
 organization
 actually
 know
 and
 how


do
 you
 keep
 building
 that
 out
 right
 and


so
 this
 diagram
 on
 the
 left
 it's
 going


to
 be
 a
 little
 hard
 to
 to
 say
 but


basically
 this
 is
 my
 view
 of
 the
 three


pieces
 that
 we've
 been
 doing
 to
 build


out
 our
 understanding
 that
 allows
 us
 to


compound
 as
 an


organization
 the
 first
 is
 what's


reflected
 by
 that
 Cube
 which
 is
 that


everything
 we've
 ever
 learned
 at


Bridgewater
 that
 we
 thought
 has


value
 we
 have
 translated
 that
 into
 an


algorithm
 we
 that
 it's
 it
 is
 that


algorithm
 itself
 is
 data
 that's
 been


stored
 everything
 we've
 ever
 learned


about
 currencies
 bonds
 economies
 growth


inflation
 everything's
 been
 learned


everything
 is
 stored
 in
 a
 way
 that's


organized
 such
 that
 you
 can
 find
 it
 you


can
 utilize
 it
 others
 can
 build
 upon
 it


we
 make
 everything
 that
 we've
 done
 we


have
 the
 standard
 of
 it
 has
 to
 be


computer
 readable
 which
 means
 we
 run
 it


three
 times
 a
 day
 it's
 always
 updated


it's
 always
 got
 the
 newest
 information


and
 human
 readable
 which
 means
 that
 a


human
 expert
 can
 look
 at
 this
 and


understand
 an
 investor
 can
 see
 this
 it's


not
 buried
 in
 code
 but
 that
 it's


available
 everything
 that
 we've
 ever


learned
 that's
 what
 the
 cube
 represents


now
 an
 organization
 of
 hundreds
 of


people
 working
 on
 that
 Cube
 you
 need


what
 the
 pyramid
 represents
 which
 is


well
 how
 do
 you
 do
 it
 when
 you
 learn


something
 where
 do
 you
 put
 it
 how
 do
 you


reflect
 your
 qualitative
 understanding


in
 ways
 that
 then
 others
 can
 access


right
 so
 the
 pyramid
 and
 what
 we
 have
 in


there
 is
 essentially
 our
 rule
 book
 of


how
 you
 go
 about
 from
 an
 idea
 to
 getting


the
 data
 you
 need
 to
 fuel
 the
 idea
 to


building
 the
 visualizations
 that
 other


people
 need
 to
 understand
 your
 idea


right
 and
 so
 that
 is
 the
 second


component
 of
 it
 and
 then
 the
 third


component
 of
 it
 is
 the
 circle
 around
 it


which
 is
 reflects
 the
 learning
 process


the
 constant
 learning
 process
 you'll


always
 be
 wrong
 about
 a
 ton
 we
 have
 two


inputs
 into
 our
 process
 one
 is
 the
 basic


Circle
 which
 is
 we're
 constantly
 making


predictions
 about
 the
 world
 we're


constantly
 getting
 them
 wrong
 we're


constantly
 learning
 by
 digesting
 why


that
 happened
 looking
 back
 and
 building


that
 out


then
 um
 there's
 also
 inputs
 in
 the
 world


something
 you've
 never
 thought
 of
 before


new
 things
 happening
 right
 and
 the
 great


thing
 about
 having
 a
 systematic
 process


is
 you
 could
 spend
 all
 your
 time
 on
 what


you
 might
 be
 missing
 in
 that
 systematic


process
 how
 do
 you
 deal
 with


geopolitical
 tensions
 and
 tariffs
 and


and
 changes
 in
 trade
 patterns
 Etc
 you


might
 not
 have
 that
 in
 your
 process
 but


if
 you
 have
 a
 process
 that
 reflects


everything
 you
 think
 about
 you
 can
 spend


all
 your
 effort
 on
 the
 new
 problems


right
 and
 the
 chart
 on
 the
 right
 is
 kind


of
 what
 I
 want
 to
 leave
 you
 with
 the
 um


it's
 the
 compounding
 point
 that
 if
 you


start
 the
 is
 true
 of
 Investments


obviously
 but
 true
 in
 an
 organization


and
 understanding
 if
 you
 start
 with
 a


basic
 level
 of
 understanding
 in
 1980
 on


a
 piece
 of
 paper
 and
 you
 keep
 Crossing


things
 out
 and
 learning
 and
 learning
 and


learning
 and
 that
 is
 that
 thing
 is
 not


in
 your
 head
 so
 it
 doesn't
 leave
 when


you
 leave
 but
 it's
 actually
 reflected
 in


that
 process
 that
 others
 can
 build
 on


your
 understanding
 follows
 a
 compound


return
 curve
 as
 an
 organization
 the
 same


way
 that
 you're
 an
 investment
 can
 if
 you


continue
 to
 compound
 so
 that's
 our


philosophy
