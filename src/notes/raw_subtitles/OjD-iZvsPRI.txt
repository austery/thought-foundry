[Music]


Good
 afternoon
 and
 and
 thank
 you


Nikolai.
 It's
 a
 privilege
 to
 be
 here.


You
 heard
 David
 speak
 about
 culture.
 You


heard
 Lars
 speak
 about
 innovation.
 They


are
 certainly
 foundational
 at
 Otis.
 But


what
 I
 want
 to
 share
 with
 you
 today
 is
 a


little
 bit
 about
 operational
 excellence


and


discipline.
 To
 do
 that,
 let
 me
 provide


some
 context
 on
 who
 we
 are.
 Uh,
 as


Shipra
 said,
 in
 September,
 we'll


celebrate
 our
 172nd
 anniversary
 of
 a


company,
 a
 company
 whose
 founder,
 Elijah


Otis,
 invented
 the
 safety
 break
 that


allowed
 all
 of
 us
 to
 feel
 safe
 riding
 up


and
 down.
 It
 allowed
 cities
 not
 just
 to


emerge,
 but
 to
 grow
 and
 thrive.
 And
 here


I
 am
 today
 to
 share
 with
 you
 how
 we
 do


that
 as
 the
 industry
 leader
 for
 the
 past


almost
 172
 years.
 Building
 on
 a
 spirit


of
 innovation,
 but
 most
 importantly


building
 on
 operational


discipline,
 very
 much
 discipline
 every


day
 in
 200
 countries
 and
 territories


around
 the
 world.
 How
 do
 we
 do
 that?
 We


do
 that
 through
 a
 team
 of
 72,000


colleagues,
 of
 which
 44,000
 are
 field


professionals.
 Field
 professionals
 who


are
 out
 installing,
 but
 most
 importantly


servicing
 our
 product
 and
 keeping
 the


world
 moving.
 2.4
 billion
 people
 we


touch
 every
 day.
 And
 I
 can't
 control
 or


train
 any
 one
 of
 them.
 We
 have
 to
 have
 a


quality
 product,
 a
 safe
 product
 because


we
 are
 in
 the
 life
 safety
 business.
 You


trust
 us
 every
 time
 you
 use
 our
 product


in
 an
 autonomous
 manner
 every
 day


without
 thinking.
 A
 ubiquitous
 product


and
 a
 ubiquitous
 service
 that
 we
 don't


care
 what
 the
 building
 purpose
 is.
 It


may
 be
 your
 residence.
 It
 may
 be
 a


hospital.
 It
 may
 be
 a
 school.
 It
 may
 be


an
 office
 building.
 But
 for
 us,
 it's
 all


about
 completing
 that
 journey
 for
 you


safely.


Every
 day
 somewhere
 in
 the
 world
 we
 are


doing
 10,000
 equipment


installations.
 And
 every
 day
 somewhere


in
 the
 world
 we
 are
 doing
 200,000


service
 calls.
 Little
 higher
 yesterday


with
 Spain
 and


Portugal.
 Crisis
 management.
 Crisis


management.
 Um,
 but
 think
 about
 what


that


takes
 in
 your
 homes,
 in
 your
 businesses,


in
 your
 travel,
 in
 infrastructure.
 to
 be


able
 to
 repeatably
 provide
 that
 with
 a


workforce
 of
 44,000
 field
 professionals


who
 work
 independently,
 who
 represent
 us


by
 wearing
 our
 our
 brand,
 our
 iconic


brand
 right
 over
 their
 heart
 on
 their


uniforms
 and
 who
 do
 this
 universally


through
 the
 same
 processes
 and
 through


the
 application
 of
 technology
 a
 little


different
 than
 Elijah
 Otis
 used
 where
 we


continuously
 innovate
 and
 disrupt


ourselves
 but
 not
 our
 processes.


not
 our
 mission
 and
 that's
 what's


important
 to
 us.
 So,
 how
 do
 we
 do


this?
 We
 do
 this
 through
 uh
 a
 very


focused
 business
 model.
 You'll
 rep


you'll
 recognize
 a
 flywheel.
 There's


probably
 no
 other
 industry
 or
 certainly


no
 other
 business
 that
 lives
 this


religiously
 every
 day.
 We
 show
 up
 every


morning
 focused.
 We
 show
 up
 and
 that's


everywhere
 in
 the
 world
 except


sanctioned
 countries.
 We
 show
 up
 focus


to
 make
 sure
 the
 world
 moves.
 To
 do


that,
 it's
 all
 about
 our
 service
 engine.


We
 sell
 new
 equipment
 to
 be
 able
 to


secure
 the
 service
 for
 15
 or
 20
 years.


We
 then
 modernize
 that
 equipment
 because


while
 an
 elevator
 will
 move
 up
 and
 down


and
 an
 escalator
 will
 move
 diagonally


and
 a
 moving
 walkway
 will
 go
 this
 way,


they
 never
 leave
 the
 building.
 So,
 we


have
 to
 come
 back
 and
 do
 technology


infusions.
 We
 have
 to
 come
 back
 and


replace
 elevators
 in
 live
 buildings


beyond
 the
 10,000
 construction
 projects


we're
 doing
 every
 day.
 And
 we
 have
 to
 do


that
 through
 proven
 processes,
 through


independent
 workforces
 who
 represent
 us


and
 who
 have
 to
 understand
 our
 purpose.


So
 we
 do
 innovate
 absolutely
 innovate
 in


products
 and
 in
 services
 but
 we
 sell


that
 new
 equipment
 we
 install
 it
 in


buildings
 throughout
 the


world
 and
 then
 we
 have
 the
 ability
 again


to
 maintain
 it
 on
 a
 scheduled


maintenance.
 We're
 in
 a
 regulated


industry
 to
 service
 it
 and
 repair
 it


when
 it
 breaks
 a
 break
 fix
 business


which
 we
 also
 do
 and
 then
 as
 the
 cycle


goes
 to
 modernize
 it
 and
 keep
 it
 in
 our


portfolio.
 There
 are
 22
 million


elevators
 and
 escalators
 in
 use
 in
 this


world.
 We
 service
 2.4
 million
 of
 those.


We
 are
 the
 largest
 service
 provider


anywhere.
 Of
 those
 2.4
 million,
 when
 we


spun
 in
 April
 of
 2020
 in
 the
 midst
 of


the
 pandemic
 and
 being
 an
 essential


service,
 we
 were
 just
 under
 two
 million


units.
 We
 are
 growing
 at
 about
 a
 100,000


units
 every
 year
 which
 had
 been
 stagnant


when
 we
 were
 part
 of
 our
 former
 parent.


We
 were
 part
 of
 a
 large
 conglomerate


where
 operational
 excellence
 was


important
 but
 it
 wasn't
 the
 critical


motivator
 where
 our
 colleagues
 were


humbly
 proud
 but
 they
 didn't
 understand


that
 it's
 all
 about
 the
 service
 flywheel


that
 allows
 us
 to
 maintain
 that
 customer


centricity
 that
 customer
 excellence
 and


that
 ability
 to
 prove
 ourselves
 each
 and


every
 day
 with
 each
 and
 every
 service


call.
 you
 don't
 think
 about
 our
 product


and
 we're
 happy
 you
 don't
 think
 about
 it


typically
 until
 there's
 an
 issue
 and


then
 whether
 you're
 entrapped
 or
 you


don't
 have
 use
 you
 think
 about
 us
 so
 now


the
 application
 of
 technology
 and
 being


more
 customer
 centric
 is
 about
 applying


IoT
 we've
 got
 a
 million
 of
 our
 2.4
 4


million
 units
 connected,
 huge
 data
 lake,


incredible
 AI
 that
 today
 allows
 us
 to
 do


preventive
 maintenance.
 So
 we're
 when


we're
 doing
 schedule
 maintenance,
 we
 can


repair
 something
 before
 it
 breaks
 and


impacts
 you
 as
 a
 customer
 or
 the
 riding


public
 and
 that
 will
 lead
 to
 prognostics


as
 well.
 We
 have
 incredible
 traffic


algorithms
 that
 use
 predictive
 AI,
 but


we
 will
 balance
 AI
 with
 the
 ethics
 of
 AI


because
 your
 life
 safety
 is
 involved.
 We


will
 use
 it
 in
 every
 part
 of
 our


business
 because
 it
 is
 revolutionary,


but
 we
 will
 also
 balance
 making
 sure
 we


don't
 have
 one
 of
 our
 field


professionals
 on
 the
 top
 of
 a
 car


maintaining
 it
 and
 making
 sure
 you're


not
 in
 it
 when
 we're
 doing
 it.
 So,


that's
 the
 balance
 that
 we
 hold.
 This


flywheel
 has
 provided
 really
 incredible


results
 to
 date
 because
 everyone's


focused
 on
 it.
 We're
 a
 service
 company.


Of
 course,
 we're
 an
 industrial.
 We
 have


17
 manufacturing
 plants.
 We
 manufacture


local
 for
 local.
 That's
 just
 that's
 just


table
 stakes
 as
 an
 industrial.
 But
 a


service
 company
 and
 as
 culture,
 we
 focus


on
 our
 we
 call
 them
 absolutes.
 We
 don't


call
 them
 values.
 We
 call
 them
 absolutes


because
 if
 you
 don't
 follow
 them,
 you


won't
 be
 part
 of
 our
 company.
 First
 is


safety.
 We
 work
 at
 heights.
 We
 work
 in


buildings
 as
 you
 can
 imagine
 in


construction
 as
 well
 as
 in
 service.


Everyone
 goes
 home
 safe
 every
 night.


Zero
 is
 the
 only
 acceptable
 answer
 for


fatalities
 or
 serious
 incidents.


We
 focus
 on
 ethics
 because
 that
 is
 what


has
 made
 our
 company
 a
 quality
 lasting


company
 and
 we
 focus
 on
 quality
 because


you
 depend
 on
 us
 for
 reliability
 and
 for


safety.
 So
 as
 we
 do
 all
 this
 the


flywheel
 works
 its
 magic
 and
 in
 our


business
 today
 a
 little
 over
 60%
 of
 our


revenue
 comes
 from
 service
 as
 you
 would


imagine
 but
 over
 90%
 of
 our


profits.
 You
 can
 think
 of
 a
 razor
 razor


blade
 where
 we
 make
 money
 on
 the
 razor


as
 well.
 So
 our
 new
 equipment
 business


is
 profitable
 but
 nowhere
 near
 the


profit
 of
 our
 service
 business.
 And
 you


may
 ask,
 is
 this


sustainable
 after
 172
 years?
 Have
 you


innovated
 enough?
 How
 have
 you
 disrupted


enough?
 Does
 your
 operational
 cadence


get
 you
 to
 tomorrow
 to
 2030
 to
 2050?


I'm
 here
 to
 say
 yes
 because
 we


consistently
 reinvent
 ourselves.
 We


consistently
 apply
 technology
 so
 that


our
 mechanics
 will
 have
 the
 best


technologies.
 It's
 not
 a
 a
 grease
 and


lube
 and
 and
 a
 mechanical
 structure


anymore.
 It's
 about
 the
 passenger


experience.
 It's
 about
 being
 customer


centric
 and
 again
 having
 preventive


information
 to
 help
 you
 as
 you
 go.
 What


we've
 seen
 is
 is
 really
 that
 incredible


focus
 and
 discipline
 gives
 us
 our


retention
 rate
 which
 is
 in
 the
 92
 to
 93%


level
 for
 customers.
 They
 stay
 with
 us


day
 after
 day,
 year
 after
 year.
 And
 they


have
 that
 choice
 in
 our
 contract


structure.
 And
 then
 when
 we
 hit
 about
 15


or
 20
 years,
 the
 flywheel
 starts
 all


over
 again
 because
 then
 we
 refurbish
 and


modernize
 the
 equipment
 in
 a
 live


building.
 And
 so
 many
 other
 companies


have
 to
 go
 adjacent.
 Everyone
 has
 to


innovate.
 We
 don't
 need
 to
 do
 that.
 We


have
 enough
 organic
 growth
 in
 front
 of


us.
 Of
 the
 22
 million
 elevators
 in
 this


world,
 over
 8
 million
 are
 over
 20
 years


old
 and
 in
 need
 of
 refreshment,
 in
 need


of
 potentially
 full
 full
 replacement.


That
 market
 will
 be
 larger
 than
 these


10,000
 construction
 jobs
 we're
 doing


every
 day
 uh
 before
 the
 end
 of
 the


decade.
 So
 we
 have
 organic
 growth
 in


front
 of
 us
 in
 our
 service
 business


which
 is
 maintenance
 and
 repair
 and
 this


modernization
 and
 refurbishment
 business


will
 be
 an
 evergreen
 opportunity
 because


by
 the
 time
 we
 finish
 this
 cycle
 it'll


be
 time
 for
 another
 cycle
 to
 be
 able
 to


keep
 buildings
 in
 the
 asbuilt
 world


moving.
 the
 results
 since
 since
 we


became
 independent
 since
 we
 became


focused
 uh
 when
 I
 joined
 Otis
 in
 late


2017
 to
 to
 turn
 the
 business
 to
 be


prepare
 for
 this
 even
 though
 the
 board


decision
 hadn't
 been
 made
 it
 was
 being


discussed
 we
 had
 a
 few
 activists
 in
 the


stock
 we
 were
 in
 our
 seventh
 year
 of
 no


earnings
 growth
 as
 part
 of
 a


conglomerate
 would
 never
 have
 survived


as
 an
 independent
 company
 2018
 was
 our


eighth
 year
 by
 2019
 19.
 We
 turned
 the


business.
 We've
 got
 all
 of
 our


colleagues
 focused.
 We're
 up


significantly
 in
 terms
 of
 topline,
 but


we're
 steady.
 We're
 we're
 not
 the
 we're


not
 the
 three
 times
 growth
 and
 and
 we're


steady.
 Operational
 excellence
 provides


for
 steady
 results.
 Our
 uh
 our
 margins


are
 up
 220
 basis
 points
 in
 the
 five


years
 since
 we've
 spun.


We
 have
 had
 service
 operating
 profit


growth
 in
 all
 21
 quarters
 and
 we
 have


had
 operating
 profit
 growth
 all
 five


years.
 And
 you
 can
 see
 the
 results
 when


you
 have


discipline,
 a
 simple
 but
 elegant


business
 model
 I
 like
 to
 call
 it,
 which


everyone
 in
 the
 company
 understands
 and


they
 understand
 our
 purpose.
 So
 our


mission
 very
 simply
 is
 to
 be
 a


world-class
 customer-
 centric


serviceoriented
 business.


Our
 vision
 is
 we
 give
 people
 freedom
 to


connect
 and
 thrive
 in
 a
 taller,
 faster,


smarter
 world.
 The
 world
 is
 getting


faster.
 It's
 certainly
 getting
 smarter


with
 AI.
 It's
 certainly
 getting
 taller


with
 urbanization
 as
 it
 continues.
 And


we
 are
 well
 positioned
 as
 a
 foundational


company
 as
 a
 foundational


disciplined
 industrial
 company,
 a


service
 company
 to
 continue
 to
 provide


the
 returns.
 Over
 this
 same
 period,
 we


have
 taken
 everyone,
 every
 dollar


primarily
 that
 we
 have
 generated
 and


returned
 $6
 billion
 of
 cash
 to
 our


shareholders
 either
 through
 dividends
 or


share


repurchases.
 I'm
 proud
 of
 our
 purpose.


I'm
 proud
 of
 who
 we
 are
 and
 I'm
 proud


that
 we
 touch
 every
 one
 of
 you
 every
 day


of
 your
 life
 and
 keep
 the
 world
 moving.


Thank
 you
 very
 much.
