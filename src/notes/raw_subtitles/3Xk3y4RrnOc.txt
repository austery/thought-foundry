I'd
 now
 like
 to
 invite
 Christian


Syninding,
 CEO
 of
 EQT
 to
 join
 us.
 Under


his
 leadership,
 EQT
 has
 quadrupled
 in


size,
 became
 Sweden's
 fourth
 largest


listed
 company
 and
 a
 leading


forwardinking
 organization
 in
 private


markets.
 Welcome,
 Christian.
 Thank


you.
 Good
 to
 be
 here.


So
 Christian,
 what
 defines
 a
 truly
 great


company
 for
 EQT?


It's
 the
 favorite
 question
 uh
 of
 the


year
 I
 would
 say.
 Uh
 so
 interesting


actually
 that
 I
 did
 a
 poll
 of
 uh
 of
 my


colleagues
 uh
 the
 call
 the
 top
 investors


at
 EQT
 and
 um
 and
 it
 came
 out
 very


consistently
 actually
 into
 three
 three


different
 categories.
 Um
 the
 first
 one


has
 to
 do
 with
 the
 industry
 or
 the


sector
 that
 the
 the
 company
 is
 in.
 And


uh
 what
 we've
 sharpened
 over
 time
 is
 is


to
 find
 long-term
 themes
 in
 society
 that


are
 not
 dependent
 necessarily
 on
 the


economic
 activity
 but
 on
 some
 other


drivers
 like
 digitalization
 of
 society,


decarbonization
 of
 society,
 aging


society,
 those
 kinds
 of
 broad
 themes


that
 are
 uh
 you
 know
 going
 to
 run
 for
 a


long
 long
 time.
 uh
 behind
 that


infrastructure
 actually
 is
 spoton
 in


there.


Um
 then
 you
 go
 to
 the
 company
 uh
 and


we're
 looking
 for
 companies
 that
 have
 a


great
 business
 model
 uh
 recurring


revenues
 in
 some
 form
 some
 kind
 of


competitive
 moat
 if
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it


that
 to
 use
 your
 language
 um
 competitive


advantage
 uh
 and
 something
 you
 can


continue
 to
 build
 on
 um
 that
 has
 lots
 of


opportunities
 to
 grow
 both
 organically


through
 acquisitions
 and
 change.
 That's


kind
 of
 category
 number
 one.
 Cate


category
 number
 two
 is


um


leadership.
 So
 a
 couple
 of
 colleagues


said
 CEO
 CEO
 CEO.
 Uh
 and
 um
 and
 of


course
 we
 own
 the
 companies,
 we
 control


the
 company.
 So
 we
 can
 install
 the


board,
 we
 can
 install
 uh
 the
 management


if
 if
 it
 doesn't
 already
 have
 a
 great


one.
 But
 I
 think
 it's
 broader
 than
 CEO.


I
 think
 it's
 the
 leadership
 group.
 It's


the
 uh
 it's
 the
 organizational
 design
 of


the
 company.
 It's
 a
 cultural
 health.
 We


we
 heard
 a
 lot
 about
 these
 things


earlier
 today.


um
 you
 know
 culture
 beats
 strategy
 for


breakfast
 as
 they
 say
 and
 I
 think
 we


heard
 that
 from
 David
 and
 others
 uh
 very


much
 true
 for
 EQT
 uh
 so
 that's
 kind
 of


that's
 category
 number
 two
 maybe
 also


ability
 to
 attract
 and
 retain
 talent


very
 important
 category
 three
 is
 we
 also


heard
 about
 from
 Otis
 and
 others
 um
 and


even
 over
 Nordisk
 it's
 actually
 the


ability
 to
 take
 you
 know
 the
 position


that
 you're
 in
 the
 strategies
 that
 you


have
 the
 leadership
 group
 that
 you
 have


and
 execute
 relentlessly


um
 and
 drive
 you
 know
 a
 culture
 of


continuous
 improvement.
 So
 it's
 not
 good


enough
 just
 to
 be
 a
 visionary,
 great
 CEO


or
 have
 a
 great
 team.
 You
 also
 actually


you
 know
 to
 drive
 execution
 every
 single


day.
 Um
 and
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 four


companies
 that
 we
 heard
 about
 this


morning
 uh
 you
 find
 those
 themes
 across


all
 of
 them
 in
 in
 various
 forms,
 right?


Yeah.
 It
 sounds
 like
 they
 put
 a
 bit
 more


emphasis
 on
 leadership
 than
 Chris
 does


in
 his
 approach.
 What
 are
 you
 looking


for
 in
 a
 CEO
 and
 in
 the
 leadership
 team?


Uh
 I'm
 looking
 for
 someone
 who
 has
 a


vision.
 Doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 vision
 area,


but
 someone
 who
 has
 a
 real
 vision.
 Where


are
 we
 taking
 the
 company
 and
 why?
 Um


someone
 who
 can
 bring
 people
 together
 uh


who
 can
 inspire
 uh
 but
 also
 be
 sharp


enough
 to
 execute.
 So
 combining
 those


two
 elements
 I
 just
 talked
 about
 um
 I


think
 uh
 the
 ability
 also
 to
 to
 change


your
 mind
 if
 a
 better
 argument
 comes
 uh


and
 have
 this
 mindset
 you
 talked
 a


little
 bit
 earlier
 about
 how
 do
 you
 deal


with
 technological
 change
 and
 threats
 um


and
 to
 have
 the
 mindset
 of
 we
 we
 call
 it


a
 future
 proofing
 what
 does
 the
 company


need
 to
 stay
 ahead
 of
 the
 curve
 what


threats
 are
 coming
 what
 opportunities


are
 coming
 right
 now
 it's
 AI
 then
 it'll


be
 AGI
 and
 then
 maybe
 quantum
 computing


whatever
 all
 these
 things
 are
 impacting


business,
 sustainability,


decarbonization,
 all
 these,
 you
 know,


how
 do
 you
 deal
 with
 that?
 Do
 you
 wait


to
 see
 what
 happens
 or
 do
 you
 take
 the


bull
 by
 the
 horns
 and
 actually
 drive


change?
 Mhm.
 Uh
 those
 are
 some
 of
 the


elements
 that
 we're
 looking
 for.
 Um
 and


then
 not
 complicating
 things
 too
 much.


Mhm.
 Sticking
 to
 what's
 important.


Mhm.
 You
 mentioned
 long-term
 themes.


Chris,
 is
 this
 approach
 that
 Christian


takes
 on
 investing
 in
 long-term


structured
 themes
 something
 that


resonates
 with
 you?
 Yeah.
 The
 the


average
 life
 of
 a
 of
 a
 holding
 of
 our


current
 portfolio
 is
 80
 years.
 Mhm.
 Now,


the
 average
 holding
 for
 a
 of
 a
 US
 stock


is
 less
 than
 one
 year.


So
 investors
 are


absolutely
 on
 mass
 short-term


um
 trading
 oriented


and
 so


why
 you


know
 it
 it
 but
 we
 should
 ask
 well
 why
 is


long-termism
 is
 it
 a
 good
 strategy?


Yeah.
 Is
 it
 why
 and
 why
 I'd
 like
 to


think
 it
 is.
 Yeah.
 Well
 we
 should
 ask


the
 question
 why.
 I
 always
 say
 justify.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And


if
 you
 look


empirically,
 it
 turns
 out
 that
 the
 very


best
 companies,
 high


rises,


they
 they
 stay
 good.
 They
 don't


disappear
 o
 overnight
 generally.
 Yep.


And
 bad
 companies
 stay
 bad.
 Lower
 stay


low.
 I
 totally
 agree.
 We
 have
 an


expression.
 Good
 companies
 are
 better


than
 they
 seem.
 Bad
 companies
 are
 worse


than
 they
 seem.
 There's
 persistency.


It's
 better.
 You
 got
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 the


bad
 ones
 and
 just
 double
 down
 on
 the


good
 ones.
 Yeah,
 there's
 persistency


and
 and
 the
 value
 of
 that
 company
 is


only
 seen
 over
 the
 long
 term.
 So
 you
 get


they
 say
 there's
 no
 free
 lunch
 in


finance,
 but
 actually
 I
 do
 think


long-termism
 in
 a
 great
 company
 is
 a


free
 lunch
 because
 the
 the
 if
 you
 look


at
 any
 sellside
 model,
 they'll
 go
 out


three
 years
 if
 if
 or
 or
 two


years.
 And
 that's
 why
 because
 that's
 the


time
 horizon
 of
 the
 typical
 buy
 side


investor.
 One,
 two,
 or
 three,
 one
 or
 two


years.
 But
 what
 if
 it
 can
 keep
 being


good
 for
 30
 years?
 Then
 you're


completely
 undervaluing
 that
 company.


We,
 you
 know,
 we
 um


and
 and
 people
 don't
 look
 at
 it
 because


there
 aren't
 most
 companies
 95%
 of


mediocre
 or
 bad
 companies.
 Yeah.
 And


they
 meet
 their
 cost
 of
 capital,
 but


they're
 not
 super
 companies.


you
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 companies
 I


mentioned,
 aerospace,
 we
 invested
 in


Saffron.
 We've
 owned
 it
 for
 13
 years


now
 and
 in
 in
 in
 we're
 actually
 one
 of


the
 largest
 investors
 in
 the
 company.


And
 uh
 um


and
 we
 made
 around
 more
 than
 a
 20%
 IR


for
 13
 years.
 It's
 a
 long
 period
 that


duration.
 Very
 long.
 Yeah.
 Very
 long


period.
 What
 company
 was
 that?
 Saffron.


Mhm.
 Yeah.
 They're
 a
 joint
 venture
 with


G
 Aerospace
 in
 aircraft
 engines


and


um
 and
 so


um
 we
 have
 investors
 who
 come
 in
 and
 say


well
 we
 want
 new
 things.
 Yeah.
 Why
 is
 it


so
 hard
 for
 investors
 to
 be
 long-term?
 I


understand
 they're
 commercial
 pressures


but
 there
 must
 be
 they
 think
 new
 is


better.
 I
 think
 you
 volatility.
 Yeah.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 You
 know
 one
 of
 the
 I'm


obviously
 interested
 in
 the
 private


markets.
 One
 of
 the
 benefits
 of
 the


private
 market
 is
 you're
 kind
 of
 forced


to
 invest
 for
 the
 long
 term.
 We
 own


companies.
 We
 own
 them
 for
 5
 to
 10
 years


at
 a
 time.
 Now,
 we're
 actually
 starting


to
 own
 them
 for
 longer
 because
 we


realize
 that
 winners
 need
 to
 be
 owned


longer
 to
 really
 uh
 get
 the
 maximum


value
 creation
 out
 of
 them
 as
 well.
 Um


but
 uh but
 but
 you're
 kind
 of
 forced
 to


invest
 for
 the
 long
 term
 and
 and
 even
 in


these
 products
 that
 now
 individuals
 can


invest
 in
 in
 our
 industry
 uh
 they're


also
 very
 long-term
 in
 their
 nature
 and


um
 you
 know
 our
 valuations
 aren't
 as


volatile.
 You
 can
 discuss
 why
 but
 uh
 but


it
 is
 because
 that
 we're
 not
 that


interested
 in
 what
 it's
 worth
 right
 now.


We're
 interested
 in
 what
 the
 companies


are
 worth.
 You
 know
 when
 we
 buy
 a


company
 we're
 interested
 in
 what
 it's


worth
 in
 five
 years
 or
 in
 seven
 years


and
 what
 we
 can
 do
 with
 that
 business
 in


the
 meantime.
 Yeah.
 And
 in
 the
 extreme,


we
 don't
 even
 care
 what
 it
 costs
 so
 much


today.
 As
 long
 as
 we
 know
 that
 we
 can


take
 it
 to
 here
 or
 we're
 highly


confident
 we
 can
 do
 that
 with
 time.


That's
 that's
 actually
 more
 important


than
 what
 we
 pay
 100
 or
 110
 today.


Doesn't
 really
 matter
 if
 you
 create
 four


or
 five
 or
 600
 up
 here
 later.
 So
 how
 do


you
 do
 that?
 You
 identify
 a
 company
 that


you
 want
 to
 buy.
 Y
 pay
 a
 price
 that


you're
 happy
 to
 pay.
 Yeah.
 And
 then


what's
 the
 playbook
 to
 create
 the
 value?


Well,
 the
 the
 playbook
 that
 we're
 trying


to
 industrialize
 is
 is
 we
 create
 a
 full


potential
 plan
 for
 the
 business.
 We
 kind


of
 dream
 say
 if
 this
 company
 had
 every


resource
 in
 the
 world
 uh
 to
 be
 able
 to


grow
 develop
 and
 go
 to
 the
 next
 level
 uh


h
 how
 what
 could
 it
 look
 like
 you
 know


if
 you
 did
 all
 the
 M&A
 you
 wanted
 to
 do


all
 the
 innovation
 uh
 you
 get
 rid
 of
 the


things
 that
 aren't
 working
 upgrade
 the


organization
 improve
 the
 margins
 all


that
 kind
 of
 stuff
 um
 okay
 so
 that's
 the


full
 potential
 uh
 what
 can
 we
 actually


get
 done
 in
 in
 a
 reasonable
 time
 period


with
 the
 people
 that
 we
 have
 involved


either
 globally
 or
 in
 the
 company
 or


whatever
 um
 we
 bring
 lots
 of
 resources


it
 for
 the
 company
 whether
 it's


governance
 or
 IT
 skills
 or
 AI
 skills
 or


sustainability
 skills
 or
 expansion
 or


M&A
 whatever
 the
 company
 needs
 we
 try
 to


bring
 those
 resources
 in
 uh
 and
 and
 then


we
 push
 the
 gas
 pedal
 pretty
 hard
 and


and
 and
 we
 go
 for
 it
 and
 we
 very
 often


don't
 meet
 the
 full
 potential
 plan
 but


that
 kind
 of
 mindset
 helps
 you
 drive
 the


company
 forward
 um
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 really


and
 also
 really
 deciding
 which
 are
 the


big
 things
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 Nova


Nordics
 Nord
 Nordics
 we
 heard
 earlier
 um


what
 are
 the
 big
 initiatives
 that
 can


really
 make
 a
 difference
 and
 then
 making


sure
 that
 you
 put
 the
 best
 people
 behind


that
 enough
 capital
 behind
 it
 and
 those


things
 that's
 that's
 what
 we
 can
 do
 in


the
 in
 the
 private
 markets
 and
 it's
 a


lot
 of
 fun
 what
 can
 you
 do
 in
 the
 public


market
 as
 an
 activist
 and
 your
 approach


has
 evolved
 a
 little
 bit
 over
 time
 yeah


it's
 an
 interesting
 debate
 private


versus
 public


um
 and


you
 know
 what,
 um


um


because
 I
 do
 think
 the
 very
 best


companies
 in
 the
 world
 are
 public


companies.
 Mhm.
 Um
 not
 everyone
 but


generally
 and
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 is


um
 in
 many
 industries
 scale
 and
 scope


matter.
 Small
 is
 not
 beautiful.


Um
 a
 and


um
 you
 you
 you


um


um
 an
 example
 of
 this
 is


uh


um
 video
 conferencing
 where
 Zoom
 new


innovator


brought
 out
 video
 conferencing
 and


Microsoft
 launched
 teams
 and
 just


distributed
 a
 free
 integrated
 in
 in in


in
 their
 bundled
 office
 product.


Now
 people
 say
 Zoom
 was
 a
 better


product,
 but
 Microsoft
 won
 because
 they


had
 this
 bundling
 strategy
 and
 they
 had


scope.
 They
 had,
 you
 know,
 advantages
 of


scope
 and
 and
 Yeah.
 and
 and and
 and
 uh


the
 ability,
 you
 know,
 customer


relationships
 and
 and and
 so
 I
 think


people
 underestimate
 sometimes
 these


powers
 of
 big
 companies
 of
 incumbency
 to


uh
 crush
 a
 competitor
 and
 and
 uh


so
 I
 um


um
 the
 but
 the
 a
 public
 market
 investor


doesn't
 have
 no


influence.
 Okay?
 if
 they're


willing,
 they
 can
 uh
 they
 can
 influence


and
 sometimes


um
 stopping
 stupid


things
 a
 and
 an
 example
 of
 saffron
 you


know
 we
 had
 this
 great


company
 reported
 eight
 times
 earnings
 it


was
 compounding
 at
 20%
 and
 then
 one
 day


they
 came
 out
 and
 tried
 to
 make
 an


incredibly
 stupid
 acquisition
 of
 a


company
 called
 Zodiac


a
 wild
 over
 valuation
 using
 shares
 which


were
 half
 their
 intrinsic
 value.
 So
 it


was
 doubly


bad.
 Um
 and
 we
 fought
 the
 deal
 and
 in


the
 end
 they
 cut
 the
 price
 in
 half
 and


then
 paid
 only
 in


cash


and
 the
 share
 price
 doubled.
 You
 know
 we


got
 sued
 by
 the
 seller.
 I
 was
 sued


personally
 for
 hund00
 million
 euros
 and


the
 uh
 my


CFO
 came
 to
 me
 very
 stressed
 one
 night


saying
 it's
 all
 right
 for
 you.
 You
 can


afford
 it


but
 they're
 going
 to
 bankrupt
 me
 and
 um


because
 the
 seller
 lost
 a
 billion
 euros


and
 uh
 and
 but
 few
 investors
 will
 act


like
 that.
 Mhm.
 Yeah.
 Most
 just
 accept


it.
 But
 in
 the
 end
 they
 they
 they
 they


cut
 the
 price
 and
 blamed
 us
 which
 was


fine.
 and
 uh
 and
 all's
 well
 that
 ends


well.
 They
 they they
 never
 did
 silly


things
 again.
 Um
 but
 but
 then
 you
 have


to
 jump
 in.
 You
 you
 have
 to
 have
 a
 big


enough
 ownership
 stake
 to
 to
 actually


have
 that
 influence,
 don't
 you?
 In
 some


form
 or
 at least
 a
 real
 voice
 that
 they


uh
 that
 they
 will
 listen
 to.
 And
 the


challenge
 in
 the
 public
 markets,
 if
 I


may
 challenge
 that,
 is
 that
 often
 the


companies
 become
 run
 by
 the
 the


management,
 right?
 because
 they're


ultimately
 ones
 then
 with
 with
 no
 active


shareholders
 they
 effectively
 point
 the


board
 and
 you
 you
 have
 a
 bit
 of
 a


governance
 that's
 a
 big
 risk
 other
 side


of
 the
 coin
 it's
 a
 big
 risk
 and
 in


general
 well
 I
 would
 maybe
 the
 journal


is
 there
 are
 many
 companies
 with
 bad


governance
 that
 become
 badly
 run
 and
 I'm


you
 know
 I'm
 not
 a
 believer
 in
 being
 an


activist
 in
 a
 bad
 industry
 or
 bad


company
 that
 doesn't
 make
 any
 sense
 but


um
 and


So,
 but
 there
 is
 a
 I
 don't
 actually


think
 the


shareholding
 necessarily
 is
 everything


can
 matter.
 We
 we
 went
 recently
 on
 the


board
 of
 a
 company
 called
 Snell
 next


cell
 phone
 towers
 and
 we
 we
 had
 10%
 and


so
 it
 mattered
 because
 there
 were
 four


comp
 four
 shareholders
 with
 10%
 each
 and


so
 it
 was
 very
 concentrated
 but
 um
 I


think
 the
 power
 of
 the


argument
 can
 win
 you
 know
 shareholders


are
 not
 stupid
 you
 know
 bank
 is
 not


going
 to
 be
 an
 activist
 themselves
 but


if
 an
 activist
 makes
 a
 good
 case
 they'll


support
 them
 yeah
 they'll
 they'll


support
 them
 whatever
 stake
 the
 activist


has
 1%
 2%
 it
 doesn't
 matter.
 So
 I
 I
 And


can
 we
 go
 back
 can
 we
 go back
 to
 the


this
 this
 statement
 that
 you
 had
 that


the
 best
 companies
 are
 public.


Um
 I
 don't
 really
 appreciate
 that
 one.


Uh
 so
 maybe
 I
 give
 some
 examples.
 You


know
 we
 but
 I
 do
 agree
 with
 you
 that


having
 companies
 that
 are
 uh
 you
 know


strong
 large
 winning
 beating
 the


competition
 whatever.
 Uh
 one
 is
 a
 very


interesting
 that
 we
 own
 which
 is
 the


world's
 largest
 private
 education


company.
 It's
 a
 $15
 billion
 company.


It's
 uh
 but
 it's
 only
 got
 5%
 market


share
 around
 the
 world,
 growing


organically
 through
 acquisitions,
 super


purpose-driven,
 doing
 very
 good
 for


society.
 Um
 and
 uh
 the
 competitors
 are,


you
 know,
 moms
 and
 pops
 all
 around
 the


world
 that
 don't
 have
 the
 resources
 to


invest
 in
 AI
 and
 the
 next
 generation
 of


education
 and
 stuff
 like
 that.
 Um
 that


is
 a
 brilliant
 uh
 company.
 We've


actually
 had
 it
 public
 twice,
 but
 the


public
 market
 didn't
 appreciate
 it.
 So,


we've
 taken
 it
 private
 twice
 and
 now


we're
 just
 going
 to
 keep
 it
 private


hopefully
 for
 as
 long
 as
 we
 can
 and
 just


build
 and
 build
 and
 build.
 So
 I
 think


the
 world
 is
 also
 changing
 because


private
 equity
 has
 gotten
 so
 large
 now


um
 and
 t
 and
 we
 can
 move
 companies
 into


longerterm
 ownership
 structures.
 So
 we


can
 actually
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 see


more
 and
 more
 of
 the
 best
 companies
 in


the
 world
 either
 stay
 private
 or
 go


private
 and
 and
 grow.
 Um
 and
 that's
 a


big
 difference
 and
 that's
 one
 of
 the


things
 we're
 seeing
 in
 the
 market
 while


you
 heard
 you
 know
 number
 of
 public


companies
 is
 shrinking
 a
 lot
 over
 time.


And
 you
 alluded
 to
 the
 importance
 of


control.
 You
 tried
 an
 approach,
 a


private
 equity
 approach
 in
 the
 listed


market
 with
 the
 EQT
 listed.
 I
 hope
 we


didn't
 have
 time
 for
 that
 one.


Some
 reflections
 on
 lessons
 learned.


Yeah,
 we
 did.
 We
 tried
 to
 start
 a
 mini


version
 of
 what
 you
 do
 and
 we
 failed


miserably
 actually.
 It
 um
 we
 you
 know


after
 we
 shut
 the
 fund
 down
 last
 year,


we
 we
 delivered
 back
 like
 90%
 of
 the


capital
 that
 was
 invested
 or
 something
 a


little
 bit
 worse
 than
 that.
 And
 uh


luckily
 it
 was
 very
 small
 and
 uh
 when
 we


realized
 we
 weren't
 good
 at
 it,
 we


actually
 did
 shut
 it
 down
 and
 uh
 focus


on
 what
 we're
 good
 at
 which
 is
 private


markets.
 Um
 I
 think
 we
 tried
 to
 apply


the
 models
 that
 you've
 heard
 me
 think


about
 here
 and
 talk
 about
 here
 uh
 in
 a


public
 setting
 where
 we
 didn't
 have
 we


didn't
 have
 the
 toolbox.
 We
 didn't
 have


the
 understanding
 of
 how
 to
 drive


influence.
 We
 thought
 we
 would
 have
 more


impact
 being
 who
 we
 are
 and
 uh
 it
 didn't


work.
 So,
 it's
 really
 about
 it's
 a
 it's


a
 lot
 a
 lot
 of
 learnings
 in
 there.
 Back


to
 really
 sticking
 to
 your
 guns
 and


doing
 what
 you
 do
 well
 and
 more
 of
 that.


There's
 like
 everything
 there's
 pros
 and


cons,
 arguments
 for
 and
 against,


but
 in
 private
 equity,
 you
 you you
 pay
 a


price
 for
 control.
 You
 pay
 a
 premium.


Yeah.
 Can
 be
 big.
 Mhm.


So,
 so
 you
 know
 every
 don't
 get
 me
 wrong


control
 has
 a
 high
 value
 has
 a
 value


let's
 say
 it
 has
 a
 value


but
 is
 it
 worth
 40%.
 Yeah.
 Or
 whatever


premium
 you
 have
 to
 pay
 in
 a
 competitive


auction.
 You
 know
 in
 public
 markets


there's
 an
 offer
 every
 day.
 Yep.
 You
 can


take
 it
 or
 leave
 it.
 and
 and and


so
 it's
 um
 um
 I
 think
 the
 the
 uh
 so
 I


just
 think
 that
 that
 point
 is
 relevant


entry
 price
 matters
 and
 yeah
 do
 you


think
 do
 you
 think
 liquidity
 is


overvalued
 in
 the
 markets


well
 the
 thing
 is
 why
 why
 do
 people
 need


liquidity
 as
 much
 as
 they
 think
 they
 do


all
 the
 time
 you
 can
 be
 wrong
 that's


something
 um
 I
 learned
 the
 yellow
 pages


example
 was
 Yeah.
 And
 if


you're
 and
 um


the
 if
 if
 you're
 wrong
 in
 private,


there's
 no
 way
 out.
 Yeah.
 In
 a
 short


term.
 And
 um
 if
 you're
 wrong
 in
 a


public,
 you
 have
 a
 chance
 to
 get
 out.


Yeah.
 You
 have
 a
 you
 have
 a
 a
 chance,


but
 you
 don't
 really
 have
 a
 chance
 to


repair
 and
 improve
 what
 you
 do
 in


private.
 Right.
 we
 can
 we
 can
 huddle


down,
 change
 the
 management,
 change
 the


board,
 divest
 underperforming


operations.
 So,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 just


a
 completely
 different
 mindset
 to
 to
 a


point.
 Yeah.
 There there's
 um
 we
 were


investors
 in
 cable.
 Yeah.
 In
 in
 the
 US


and
 yeah,
 we
 own
 a
 lot
 of
 cable
 charter


and
 uh
 communications
 and
 uh
 before
 that


Time
 Warner
 Cabled
 and
 and
 it
 it
 was
 a


great
 in
 investment
 for
 uh
 eight
 years.


We
 made
 I
 know
 five
 billion
 a
 P&L
 and
 I


know
 five
 times
 our
 money.
 But
 then
 the


industry
 started
 to
 deteriorate.
 It


became
 saturated
 and
 more
 competitive


and
 people
 started
 overbuilding
 private


equity.
 Yep.
 We
 bought
 we
 bought
 lots
 of


those
 companies.
 So
 it
 started
 over
 one


of
 our
 best
 sectors
 actually
 and


yeah
 I
 sold.
 Yeah
 because
 it
 it
 changed.


We
 were
 buying.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


Unfortunately
 we
 are
 in
 the
 end
 of
 the


session
 already.
 I
 would
 love
 to


continue
 for
 much
 longer.
 Chris,
 you


shared
 many
 of
 your
 secrets.
 You
 shared


more
 in
 a
 podcast
 that
 you
 recorded
 with


Nikolai
 which
 will
 be
 released
 on
 the


14th
 of
 May.
 So
 I
 encourage
 everyone
 to


listen
 to
 that
 one.
 We'll
 take
 a
 break


now.
 So
 please
 be
 back
 in
 this
 room
 at


15:25.
 But
 first
 and
 most
 importantly,
 a


big
 big
 thanks
 to
 both
 of
 you
 for


sharing
 your
 insights
 and
 to
 meet
 you.


It
 was
 fun.
