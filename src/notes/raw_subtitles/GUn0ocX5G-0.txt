I was born and raised in Zambia,
a country known for its rich
copper mining history.
Alignment of the stars meant
that by birth and by science,
I became a miner.
Everything we build and use
was either grown or mined.
From the walls to the windows,
the tables and the chairs,
your phones, your computers,
the stage, my copper earrings
and maybe your jewelry.
So today when we talk
about building a circular economy,
we mean we need to electrify everything.
Our economies will have cars
and trucks, robots,
drones and aircraft powered by batteries.
Our children will need computers
in all schools with equal access,
and we'll have data centers full
of advanced chips to bring us AI,
all sourced by abundant sources
of renewable energy.
The raw materials we'll need
will be recyclable
so we can become clean and circular.
So that means a lot more lithium,
copper, cobalt, nickel and others.
So we need to build
more than 400 new mines by 2040
for us to become circular.
But before you can build a mine,
you have to find the raw materials.
The thing is, today's
mining industry leaders
are doing too little to advance
our qualities of life.
In other industries that rely
on discovery for growth,
like pharmaceuticals and technology,
for every dollar
they return to shareholders,
they spend about a dollar in R and D.
In mining, however,
for every dollar returned to shareholders,
less than a penny is spent in exploration.
With such underinvestment,
it shouldn't surprise you
that the technology used
in exploration and mining
has barely advanced.
In fact, we've gotten ten
times worse in the last 30 years
at making ore body discoveries.
But there's good news.
The vast majority of ore deposits
are still out there waiting to be found.
They're just harder to find.
Of all the past mines we know of,
they were easy because they were
poking out of the surface
and they were near the surface.
So we need to look deeper.
Controversially, we've been taught
that these materials will run out.
We don't lack ore body deposits.
We lack information of where they lie.
So if you had a crystal ball,
you'd just look into it
and start digging out the rocks
that are the best
and generate the least waste.
But we don't have a crystal ball.
So the thing that we should
do is make predictions
of where these materials lie.
My colleagues and I at KoBold are doing
what the industry has neglected to do.
We aim to predict everything,
quantify what we don't know
and collect information efficiently.
So we're all going to try that right now.
I want you to predict
1,000 meters below your feet
what the concentration of copper is
right where you're sitting.
I want you to predict how hard it is,
how fractured it is, what's its density?
We aim to predict
all these things and more.
We're developing machine
learning technologies
that help us predict all of this
and rigorously quantify
our uncertainties in these predictions.
So what does this look like in practice?
When we're exploring for mines,
we often fly aircraft thousands
of kilometers across the Earth
to try collect information
such as the Earth's magnetism,
its gravitational field,
that tells us something
about the rocks beneath.
But there's a problem.
For everything that we're looking at,
there are going to be
an infinite number of possibilities.
And that's because we're building
three-dimensional models
to fit two-dimensional data.
So if a body was smaller
and closer to the surface
or larger and further away,
the measurement would be the same.
So this body will also fit the data.
And will this one,
and this one,
and many more.
The incumbent industry
deals with this problem by ignoring it.
They pick one possible answer
and act like the other ones don't exist.
And as a result,
we design suboptimal mines,
make suboptimal decisions,
often mining unnecessary material.
We've invented a different way.
We collect all the possibilities
consistent with the data measured,
and we do this by simulating
the physical response
of each of the arrangement of rocks.
We do this 10,000 times faster
by training an AI
to learn the relevant physics
of the rock beneath,
in the time it takes
the conventional method to test one.
That means we collect better data,
we make better predictions
of where to look next.
So if you had a rock body
and a rock body that's denser
than material around it,
you might drill through the middle of it.
But if you have all the hundreds
of thousands of possible solutions,
the best thing you can do
is to collect data
where you're the most uncertain
and rigorously eliminate
as many possibilities as possible.
This enables us to maximize
the information we get
for every dollar we spend,
and we do this repeatedly
so we can quantify our uncertainties.
Even after we've made
an ore body discovery,
we still have to contend
with this uncertainty.
We have to define the size
and shape of this ore body.
Let me illustrate how difficult this is.
So now, 1,000 meters below your feet,
you drilled, you sampled the rock
and you determined
that it has five percent copper.
So now you know, you've got
your data point and your observation.
Now, I ask you to make a prediction
of the concentration of copper
of the person sitting next to you.
(Laughter)
What would your prediction be
and how confident
would you be in your prediction?
What about across the room?
Think of any person across this room
and try to predict
1,000 meters below them.
What about in the next building
or the next city?
This is the vast challenge that we face.
We've only sampled
a tiny fraction of rock,
collected several football fields
apart from each other,
for which we're trying to make predictions
of all the rock properties in between.
This technology has helped us move fast
in Zambia, where I come from,
to design and develop a mine
based on our predictions
for which we've only sampled
a tiny fraction of rock.
Once again, there are many possibilities,
all consistent with the data.
Some with a lot more metal,
some with less.
And the difference
is a measure of uncertainties.
This enables us to know
where we should collect information next,
where we should drill the next hole,
and when we can stop drilling
and actually start building a mine.
To build the mine of the future,
we continue to contend
with this uncertainty.
The industry designs an entire
mine based on a single model.
We're developing KoBold mine,
a mine-design optimization tool
that looks at the many
possible mine designs
against the many possible
ore body geometries
that we talked about earlier.
This enables the best decisions
about how much ore we're going to mine,
how much waste we're going to produce,
how much water we'll use,
the cash flows, and so on.
This enables the best
mine planning decisions
about where to put permanent
infrastructure, like a shaft.
Where the traffic
and the tunnels will be placed
so we can make efficient decisions,
and also how we can maximize the ore
and the metal we get
and minimize the waste.
This technology will move
into mine operations
to help guide day-to-day
decisions for efficiencies.
Better predictions
don't just mean profitability.
It means a safer mine,
knowing where the rocks are weaker.
It means an environmentally
sustainable mine
so we can lessen our impact
on the environment.
And it also means
a resilient mine with cash flows
to support local communities
and businesses
through different
commodity pricing cycles.
Our Mingomba project in Zambia
will be the mine of the future.
It's being designed and developed
by amazing talent from around the world,
including Zambians
and Africans like myself.
We face the reality that our need
for these materials will continue to grow
because our lifestyles
are going to advance
and they're going to demand for it.
So the mining industry
must ensure they transform
so we can become responsible miners
and build better mines
with better technology.
Asante and thank you.
