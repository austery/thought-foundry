This
 is
 Bloomberg
 Law
 with
 June
 Graasso


from
 Bloomberg
 Radio.


There
 have
 been
 15
 government
 shutdowns


in
 the
 last
 44
 years.
 But
 no
 president


has
 ever
 used
 a
 shutdown
 to
 fire
 large


numbers
 of
 federal
 employees
 until


Donald
 Trump.
 Even
 before
 the
 shutdown


began,
 Trump
 threatened
 to
 fire
 federal


workers.
 and
 he's
 made
 good
 on
 those


threats.
 According
 to
 court
 filings,
 at


least
 4,000
 federal
 workers
 across


different
 agencies
 have
 already
 been


fired.
 Trump
 blames
 it
 on
 the
 Democrats


>> taking
 place
 right
 now.
 And
 it's
 all


because
 of
 the
 Democrats.
 The
 Democrats


are
 causing
 the
 loss
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 jobs


with
 their
 uh
 it's
 a
 shutdown.
 It's


their
 shutdown,
 not
 our
 shutdown.
 It's


their
 shutdown.
 To
 be
 clear,
 the
 firings


are
 different
 from
 the
 furlows
 that


always
 occur
 when
 government
 funding


runs
 out.
 And
 this
 unprecedented
 action


by
 the
 Trump
 administration
 puts
 the


government
 in
 uncharted
 legal
 territory


because
 there's
 no
 law,
 rule,
 or


regulation
 that
 gives
 the
 president


license
 to
 fire
 federal
 employees
 just


because
 funding
 has
 lapsed.
 Joining
 me


is
 constitutional
 law
 expert
 David


Super,
 a
 professor
 at
 Georgetown
 Law.


He's
 written
 about
 the
 firings
 in
 the


balkcanization,
 a
 blog
 of
 constitutional


law
 scholars.
 David,
 no
 administration


has
 ever
 engaged
 in
 largecale
 firings
 of


federal
 workers
 during
 a
 shutdown


before.
 So,
 there'll
 be
 no
 legal
 case


directly
 on
 point.
 But,
 is
 it
 legal?
 It


pretty
 clearly
 is
 not
 legal
 for
 them
 to


do
 it.
 For
 one
 thing,
 there's
 a
 lapse
 in


appropriations
 right
 now.
 So
 laying


people
 off
 requires
 government
 activity


that
 is
 not
 funded.
 So
 simply
 we
 think


of
 a
 layoff
 as
 a
 negative
 thing,
 but
 it


takes
 positive
 action
 to
 figure
 out
 who


you're
 going
 to
 lay
 off,
 what
 date


you're
 going
 to
 lay
 them
 off,
 send
 them


a
 message,
 and
 so
 on.
 Those
 are
 all


non-emergency
 actions
 that
 the


government
 can't
 do
 when
 it's
 unfunded.


So
 right
 there,
 that
 makes
 it
 illegal.


>> The
 first
 challenge
 is
 likely
 to
 be


based
 on
 the
 Anti-Deficiency


Act.
 So
 tell
 us
 what
 the
 Anti-Deficiency


Act
 is.


>> Well,
 the
 Constitution
 says
 that
 no


funds
 shall
 be
 drawn
 from
 the
 Treasury


except
 if
 appropriated
 by
 Congress.
 And


the
 Anti-Deficiency
 Act
 is
 a
 law


Congress
 has
 passed
 and
 revised
 many


times
 to
 implement
 the
 appropriations


clause
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 people
 aren't


just
 spending
 public
 money
 or
 committing


public
 money
 on
 their
 own.
 The


Anti-Deficiency
 Act
 basically
 says
 that


it
 is
 a
 crime
 for
 a
 government
 official


to
 spend
 public
 money
 without
 an


appropriation.
 It
 also
 says
 it's
 a
 crime


to
 accept
 voluntary
 service.
 The
 reason


it
 says
 it's
 a
 crime
 to
 accept
 voluntary


service
 is
 because
 Congress
 has
 been


around
 that
 game
 plenty
 of
 times
 where


someone
 works
 supposedly
 for
 free
 and


then
 turns
 around
 and
 wants
 to
 be
 paid.


So
 they
 said,
 "No,
 we
 don't
 even
 allow


you
 to
 take
 volunteer
 labor
 unless


there's
 an
 appropriation
 to
 cover
 the


cost."


>> Has
 anyone
 ever
 been
 prosecuted
 under


that
 law?


There
 hasn't
 been,
 perhaps
 not


surprisingly,
 because
 the
 people
 who


would
 violate
 it
 would
 be
 members
 of
 the


same
 administration
 as
 the
 attorney


general
 in
 charge
 of
 the
 Justice


Department,
 but
 also,
 frankly,
 because


people
 take
 it
 very
 seriously.
 And
 I


have
 been
 involved
 in
 a
 number
 of
 cases


where
 government
 lawyers
 will
 do
 just


about
 anything
 except
 something
 that


looks
 like
 it
 might
 be
 a
 violation
 of


the
 anti-deficiency
 act
 and
 they
 will


dig
 in
 their
 heels
 and
 stand
 on
 their


head
 to
 avoid
 being
 seen
 as
 going


crosswise
 to
 that
 which
 I
 admire.
 So,


what
 might
 the
 administration's
 response


be
 to
 lawsuits
 challenging
 the
 firings


under
 the
 Anti-Deficiency
 Act?


>> Um,
 it's
 a
 little
 unclear,
 but
 they
 seem


to
 be
 saying
 that
 this
 is
 an
 inherent


power
 of
 the
 president,
 which
 is
 pretty


strange
 because
 everything
 the


government
 does,
 particularly
 under


their
 unified
 executive
 theory,
 is
 a


power
 of
 the
 president.
 So
 does
 that


mean
 that
 this
 inherent
 power
 of
 the


president
 which
 they
 can't
 locate


anywhere
 in
 the
 constitution
 overrides


the
 appropriations
 clause
 which


absolutely
 does
 appear
 in
 the
 text
 of


the
 constitution?
 It's
 a
 very
 strange


argument.


>> The
 second
 possible
 problem
 here.
 Some


of
 the
 firings
 might
 be
 illegal


impoundments
 of
 appropriated
 funds
 where


unexpired
 appropriations
 remain


available
 to
 pay
 the
 terminated


employees.


Yes.
 The
 Supreme
 Court
 in
 1975
 ruled


unanimously


that
 President
 Nixon
 could
 not
 refuse
 to


spend
 money
 that
 Congress
 had


appropriated.
 That
 that's
 not
 within
 the


powers
 of
 the
 president.
 Justice


Ranquist
 signed
 on
 to
 that.
 Justice


Douglas
 agreed
 with
 that
 result.


Everybody
 of
 all
 perspectives
 on
 the


court
 said,
 "No,
 the
 president
 cannot


overrule
 a
 congressional
 appropriation


unless
 Congress
 makes
 the
 spending


condition
 on
 the
 president's
 choice."
 So


when
 Congress
 has,
 for
 example,
 provided


funding
 for
 the
 Centers
 for
 Disease


Control
 or
 the
 Office
 of
 Special


Education
 or
 Community
 Economic


Development,
 those
 funds
 must
 be
 spent


by
 the
 president.
 You
 can't
 spend
 money


on
 the
 Centers
 for
 Disease
 Control
 staff


if
 the
 staff
 are
 gone.
 So
 he
 is


effectively
 setting
 himself
 up
 to


refusing
 to
 spend
 money
 that
 Congress


appropriated.
 That's
 not
 appropriate.


>> And
 in
 some
 of
 these
 lawsuits
 that
 have


been
 brought
 about,
 you
 know,
 the


massive
 federal
 layoffs
 initially


initiated
 by
 Elon
 Musk,
 has
 the
 Supreme


Court
 taken
 a
 position
 on
 this?
 The


Supreme
 Court
 has
 not
 reached
 the
 merits


of
 any
 of
 these
 cases.
 They
 have


indicated
 that
 they
 don't
 want
 the


government
 order
 to
 spend
 money
 until
 a


case
 has
 been
 firmly
 resolved,
 but


that's
 not
 based
 on
 the
 merits
 of
 the


case,
 but
 just
 on
 the
 sense
 that
 if
 the


government
 spends
 the
 money,
 it
 could


never
 get
 it
 back
 if
 it
 ultimately
 wins


the
 case.
 So
 the
 only
 decisions
 we


really
 have
 from
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 are


the
 unanimous
 decision
 from
 1975
 that


says
 the
 president
 has
 no
 inherent


authority
 to
 impound
 money
 and
 a
 63


decision
 from
 1998
 that
 said
 that
 even


when
 Congress
 allows
 the
 president
 to


impound
 money,
 he
 still
 can't
 do
 it.


But
 neither
 of
 those
 are
 from
 the


Roberts
 Court,
 which
 as
 you
 know
 has


expanded
 presidential
 authority
 in
 ways


that
 most
 scholars
 thought
 they
 never


would.
 So
 is
 the
 Roberts
 court
 perhaps


going
 to
 be
 different?


>> Well,
 there's
 only
 one
 justice
 currently


sitting
 who
 was
 sitting
 in
 1998,
 and


that's
 Justice
 Thomas.
 and
 he
 voted
 with


the
 majority
 that
 even
 when
 authorized


by
 Congress,
 the
 president
 may
 not


impound
 money.
 The
 court
 in
 the
 opinion


that
 Justice
 Thomas
 signed
 on
 to
 said


that's
 effectively
 giving
 the
 president


the
 power
 to
 amend
 a
 law
 and
 under
 our


constitution
 only
 Congress
 can
 amend


laws.
 The
 third
 ground
 to
 challenge
 the


firings
 that
 you
 mentioned
 in
 your


article
 is
 that
 the
 action
 likely


violates
 permanent
 laws
 creating
 and


assigning
 duties
 to
 the
 agencies


affected.
 Explain
 that
 argument.


>> Certainly,
 we
 don't
 just
 come
 upon
 these


government
 agencies
 by
 chance.
 They're


generally
 created
 by
 Congress.
 So,
 the


Congress
 has
 passed
 a
 law
 calling
 for


the
 Center
 for
 Disease
 Control,
 saying


that
 it
 is
 vitally
 important
 to
 the


nation's
 protection
 against
 disease
 and


needs
 to
 have
 the
 resources
 to
 respond.


You
 don't
 have
 the
 resource
 to
 respond


if
 all
 your
 staff
 is
 at
 the
 unemployment


office.
 So,
 this
 is
 effectively
 a


violation
 of
 the
 law
 creating
 the


Centers
 for
 Disease
 Control.
 Similarly,


there's
 a
 law
 creating
 the
 Office
 of


Special
 Education
 at
 the
 Department
 of


Education,
 giving
 it
 a
 lot
 of
 very
 heavy


responsibilities.
 It
 can't
 perform
 that


if
 it
 doesn't
 have
 any
 people.
 And


that's
 true
 for
 pretty
 much
 all
 of
 the


agencies
 affected
 here.
 Congress
 has


told
 the
 president
 to
 get
 this
 done.
 It


has
 provided
 the
 money
 to
 get
 this
 done.


And
 the
 president
 is
 refusing
 to
 get


this
 done.
 In
 some
 of
 the
 preliminary


cases
 though,
 I
 can
 think
 of
 the


Department
 of
 Education
 cases.
 The


Supreme
 Court
 has
 allowed
 the
 president


to
 keep
 doing
 what
 he's
 doing
 though,


right?
 They
 haven't
 put
 a
 stop
 on
 his


firing
 people
 or
 not
 using
 funds.


>> They
 haven't.
 Again,
 not
 because
 they've


said
 it's
 legally
 correct,
 but
 because


they've
 said
 that
 they
 don't
 want
 any


interim
 orders
 to
 the
 president


compelling
 this
 because
 the
 president


wouldn't
 be
 able
 to
 get
 the
 money
 back


if
 the
 case
 was
 ultimately
 decided
 in


the
 president's
 favor.
 Once
 these
 cases


have
 worked
 their
 way
 through
 the


system,
 which
 I
 think
 is
 very
 possible


in
 the
 current
 Supreme
 Court
 term,
 we'll


now
 know
 what
 the
 current
 court
 thinks


about
 all
 these
 things.
 And
 at
 that


point,
 I
 think
 it'll
 be
 very
 easy
 to
 get


emergency
 orders
 against
 them
 from
 doing


something
 that
 we've
 recently
 been
 told


is
 illegal.


>> That
 would
 certainly
 be
 a
 change
 from


the
 emergency
 docket.
 Okay,
 stay
 with


me.
 Coming
 up
 next,
 I'll
 continue
 this


conversation
 with
 constitutional
 law


professor
 David
 Super
 of
 Georgetown
 Law.


After
 the
 shutdown,
 what
 legal
 action


can
 federal
 workers
 who
 were
 fired
 take?


Hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 government


workers
 have
 been
 furled
 in
 recent
 days.


And
 in
 a
 court
 filing
 on
 Friday,
 the


Office
 of
 Management
 and
 Budget
 said


well
 over
 4,000
 federal
 employees
 would


soon
 be
 fired
 in
 conjunction
 with
 the


shutdown.
 Labor
 unions
 have
 already


filed
 a
 lawsuit
 to
 stop
 the
 move
 by


President
 Trump's
 budget
 office,
 which


goes
 far
 beyond
 what
 usually
 happens
 in


a
 government
 shutdown.
 No
 president


before
 has
 used
 a
 shutdown
 to
 fire
 large


numbers
 of
 federal
 employees.


I've
 been
 talking
 to
 constitutional
 law


professor
 David
 Super
 of
 Georgetown
 Law,


who's
 written
 about
 the
 various
 ways
 the


shutdown
 can
 be
 challenged.
 A
 final


ground
 you
 mentioned
 in
 your
 article
 is


that
 this
 action
 likely
 violates
 several


civil
 service
 laws
 because
 the
 Trump


administration


may
 not
 have
 complied
 with
 every
 single


requirement
 in
 civil
 service
 laws
 and


there
 must
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 civil
 service


laws
 about
 this.


>> There
 are
 and
 there
 are
 very
 detailed


laws
 about
 prioritizing
 who
 gets
 laid


off
 when
 there
 is
 a
 layoff.
 There's
 no


clear
 evidence
 that
 they've
 followed


that.
 There
 are
 laws
 about
 giving
 people


who
 are
 more
 senior
 the
 opportunity
 to


bid
 for
 other
 jobs
 in
 the
 government.


Nothing
 that
 I've
 seen
 in
 the
 layoff


notices
 that
 have
 been
 shared
 with
 me
 or


that
 I've
 read
 in
 news
 accounts
 suggests


they're
 doing
 anything
 of
 that.
 And
 most


fundamentally,


there
 is
 very
 extensive
 civil
 service


law
 against
 politicizing
 the
 civil


service.
 And
 the
 president
 has
 said
 he's


laying
 people
 off
 from
 Democrat


agencies.
 I
 thought
 they
 were
 United


States
 agencies,
 but
 apparently
 he


considers
 them
 Democrat
 agencies.
 And


laying
 people
 off
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 their


political
 beliefs
 because
 they're


perceived
 to
 be
 Democrats
 and
 Democrat


agencies
 violate
 several
 provisions
 of


civil
 service
 law
 against
 politicizing


our
 civil
 service.


The
 main
 government
 workers
 unions
 filed


the
 lawsuit
 on
 September
 30th,
 even


before
 the
 shutdown
 began,
 and
 also
 the


AFL
 CIO
 did.
 Has
 the
 Supreme
 Court


rejected
 the
 idea
 of
 standing
 by
 unions


in
 this
 kind
 of
 situation?
 It
 said
 very


little,
 but
 there
 was
 a
 case
 brought
 by


unions
 and
 nonprofits
 against
 layoffs
 in


the
 spring
 and
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 stayed.


It
 froze
 the
 lower
 court's
 injunction


and
 said
 that
 it
 had
 concerns
 about
 the


standing
 of
 the
 plaintiffs.
 Like
 so
 many


of
 these
 shadow
 docket
 decisions,
 it


didn't
 say
 what
 those
 concerns
 were.
 It


didn't
 give
 us
 any
 sense
 as
 to
 whether


it
 thinks
 these
 plaintiffs
 are
 hopeless


or
 whether
 it
 thinks
 their
 lawyers
 just


filled
 out
 the
 paperwork
 wrong.


>> In
 this
 case,
 you
 had
 Russell
 VA
 on


social
 media
 saying,
 you
 know,
 the
 riffs


are
 coming
 and
 as
 you
 mentioned
 before,


the
 anti-deficiency
 act
 is
 pretty
 well


known
 to
 government
 officials.
 So,
 is
 it


the
 case
 that
 the
 career
 officials
 are


gone
 or
 are
 not
 advising
 against
 actions


that
 will
 clearly
 lead
 to
 lawsuits
 where


the
 government
 is
 not
 in
 the
 best


position?


>> A
 lot
 of
 queer
 people
 are
 gone,
 fired
 or


encouraged
 to
 retire
 or
 to
 leave
 by


various
 waves
 of
 actions
 in
 departments


and
 by
 doze
 generally.
 Others
 have
 been


made
 very
 clear
 that
 their
 opinions
 are


unwelcome.
 Indeed,
 when
 you
 see
 someone


raising
 concerns
 about
 violations
 of
 law


and
 that
 person
 is
 promptly
 fired,
 you


don't
 raise
 them
 yourself.
 And
 that's


completely
 contrary
 to
 the
 system
 we've


had
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 The
 courts
 have


trusted
 the
 United
 States
 government


precisely
 because
 there
 was
 a
 core
 of


career
 people,
 lawyers,
 and
 others
 who


were
 very
 careful
 that
 they
 always


follow
 the
 law.
 Political
 officials
 can


make
 the
 policy
 choices.
 That's
 why
 we


have
 elections.
 But
 the
 law
 is
 permanent


until
 someone
 changes
 it.
 And
 career


people
 have
 quite
 properly
 refused
 to
 do


illegal
 things
 throughout
 the
 years.


That
 safety
 net
 of
 honorable
 career


people
 has
 been
 ripped
 apart.
 Do
 you


think
 this
 is
 President
 Trump
 once
 again


testing
 and
 trying
 to
 expand
 his
 powers


or
 is
 it
 just
 his
 theme
 of
 there's
 too


much
 federal
 government,
 too
 many


workers,
 and
 I
 want
 to
 cut
 it
 down?


>> He's
 suggested
 that
 this
 is
 political


retribution,
 that
 he's
 doing
 this
 to


punish
 Senate
 Democrats
 for
 not
 agreeing


to
 the
 legislation
 that
 his


administration
 wrote
 without
 uh
 changes.


So
 I
 have
 to
 assume
 that
 this
 is
 an


effort
 to
 play
 politics
 and
 put
 pressure


on
 the
 Democrats
 to
 fold
 in
 the
 current


standoff.


>> Now
 if
 federal
 workers
 are
 fired
 during


this
 shutdown
 afterwards,
 what's
 their


avenue
 of
 appeal?
 Do
 they
 try
 to
 go
 to


the
 merit
 systems
 protection
 board?


>> There
 have
 been
 courts
 that
 say
 that
 if


they
 believe
 they've
 been
 fired


improperly,
 they
 must
 go
 to
 the
 merit


systems
 protection
 board.
 But
 that's
 not


going
 to
 work
 very
 well
 because


President
 Trump
 illegally
 fired
 the
 only


Democratic
 member
 of
 the
 board.
 It
 now


doesn't
 have
 a
 quorum
 and
 can't
 hear


their
 cases.
 President
 Trump
 could
 have


appointed
 a
 replacement
 for
 that
 person


he
 fired,
 but
 he's
 not
 chosen
 to
 do
 so.


So,
 he
 has
 effectively
 disabled
 the
 body


responsible
 for
 policing
 his
 own


actions.


>> What
 about
 the
 civil
 service
 laws?
 It


seems
 likely
 that
 the
 Trump


administration
 did
 not
 follow
 the
 civil


service
 laws.
 So,
 is
 that
 an
 avenue
 of


appealing
 their
 termination
 or
 getting


back
 pay?


>> In
 theory,
 they
 would
 go
 to
 the
 Merit


Systems
 Protection
 Board
 and
 if
 it
 ruled


against
 them,
 they
 could
 take
 that
 to


court.
 But
 in
 practice,
 they're
 not


getting
 any
 rulings
 favorable
 or


unfavorable
 from
 the
 Merit
 Systems


Protection
 Board
 because
 it
 can't


function
 without
 a
 quorum
 thanks
 to


President
 Trump's
 illegal
 firing
 of
 its


Democratic
 member.
 So,
 they're
 really


stuck
 in
 a
 trap.
 In
 past
 times,
 the


Supreme
 Court
 has
 said
 if
 appealing
 to


an
 administrative
 body
 would
 be
 clearly


feudal,
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 do
 it.
 You
 can


go
 straight
 to
 court.
 This
 Supreme
 Court


seems
 less
 likely
 to
 go
 in
 that


direction.


>> So
 much
 these
 days
 seems
 to
 depend
 on


the
 Supreme
 Court
 and
 we
 will
 watch
 how


this
 litigation
 unfolds.
 Thanks
 so
 much,


David.

 always,

[Music]


Luigi
 Manion's
 lawyers
 are
 asking
 a
 New


York
 federal
 judge
 to
 dismiss
 some


criminal
 charges,
 including
 the
 only


count
 for
 which
 he
 could
 face
 the
 death


penalty.
 His
 lawyers
 also
 said
 that


prosecutors
 should
 be
 prevented
 from


using
 at
 trial
 his
 statements
 to
 law


enforcement
 officers
 and
 his
 backpack


where
 a
 gun
 and
 ammunition
 were
 found.


They
 say
 Manion
 was
 not
 read
 his
 rights


before
 he
 was
 questioned
 by
 law


enforcement
 officers.
 They
 added
 that


the
 officers
 did
 not
 obtain
 a
 warrant


before
 searching
 Manion's
 backpack.
 The


27year-old
 has
 pleaded
 not
 guilty
 to


state
 and
 federal
 charges
 in
 the
 fatal


shooting
 of
 healthc
 care
 executive
 Brian


Thompson
 on
 December
 4th
 as
 he
 arrived


at
 a
 Manhattan
 hotel
 for
 his
 company's


annual
 investor
 conference.
 Pat,
 tell
 us


about
 the
 charges
 that
 the
 defense
 is


asking
 the
 judge
 to
 drop
 against
 Manion.


>> These
 two
 counts,
 especially
 count


three,
 murder
 um
 using
 a
 firearm
 is
 the


death
 penalty
 eligible
 count.
 It
 makes


sense
 for
 Luigi's
 Manion's
 criminal


defense
 lawyers
 to
 make
 this
 argument


because
 that
 would
 basically
 stop
 the


government
 or
 block
 the
 government
 from


putting
 him
 uh
 to
 death
 if
 a
 jury
 would


find
 him
 guilty
 and
 then
 decide
 that
 he


should
 face
 the
 death
 penalty.
 Um
 it's


always
 a
 two-part
 thing.
 Of
 course,
 you


know
 that.
 So,
 basically,
 that's
 the


effort
 to
 try
 to
 hamper
 the
 government


from
 proceeding
 with
 the
 two
 gun


charges.
 Count
 four
 is
 using
 a
 firearm.


But
 basically,
 Manion's
 lawyers
 are


saying,
 you
 know,
 he's
 accused
 of


stalking
 and
 one
 of
 them
 is


cyberstalking
 and
 his
 lawyers
 are
 saying


there's
 no
 evidence.
 So
 these
 things


don't
 feed
 into
 each
 other.
 So
 it's
 sort


of
 like
 a
 a
 natural
 chain
 of
 failing
 to


prove
 their
 case,
 prove
 it
 up
 to
 support


the
 counts
 three
 and
 four.


>> Yeah.
 They're
 saying
 stalking
 isn't
 a


crime
 of
 violence.
 Right.


>> Right.
 And
 it
 shouldn't
 trigger


automatically
 the
 capital
 punishment


which
 is
 what
 the
 DOJ
 and
 Pam
 Bondi
 has


said.
 The
 defense
 has
 gone
 on
 overdrive


to
 try
 to
 assail
 the
 way
 the
 government


came
 upon
 the
 death
 penalty.
 I
 mean,


typically
 what
 has
 happened,
 I
 mean,
 not


only
 did
 Joe
 Biden's
 administration
 put


a
 a
 pause
 on
 the
 death
 penalty
 for
 a


while
 there,
 and
 of
 course,
 when
 Trump


came
 back
 in,
 he
 took
 it
 off,
 and
 his


attorney
 general
 did
 not
 use,
 we've


talked
 about
 this
 before,
 there's
 a


death
 uh
 panel,
 which
 basically
 at
 DOJ


hears
 a
 presentation
 from
 the
 defense


about
 whether
 or
 not
 they're
 mitigating


circumstances
 that
 the
 person
 should
 not


face
 the
 death
 penalty.
 So
 these
 were


skipped
 over
 according
 to
 Manion's


lawyers
 and
 now
 they're
 basically


attacking
 the
 way
 the
 government
 came


upon
 this
 indictment
 that
 it's
 flawed.


Yeah.
 Now
 something
 I
 I
 found
 this
 very


surprising.
 They're
 saying
 that


prosecutors
 should
 be
 barred
 from
 using


some
 statements
 he
 made
 to
 police
 before


he
 was
 arrested
 and
 evidence
 found


inside
 his
 backpack,
 which
 includes
 a


gun
 and
 ammunition,
 because
 the
 police


didn't
 read
 his
 Miranda
 rights
 to
 him


before
 questioning
 him
 and
 didn't
 get
 a


warrant
 before
 searching
 his
 backpack.


Yeah,
 they
 describe
 it's
 it's


incredible.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 so
 the


scenario
 we've
 all
 heard
 is,
 you
 know,


that
 here
 he
 was
 and
 Manion
 was,
 you


know,
 approached
 by
 Altuna
 police
 and,


you
 know,
 immediately
 they
 found
 his


backpack
 and
 they
 arrested
 him.
 And
 you


know,
 it's
 a
 story
 that
 his
 his
 lawyers


challenge
 saying
 that
 they
 had
 video


body
 cam
 footage
 as
 well
 and
 they
 showed


outtakes
 that
 they
 have.
 But
 one
 of
 the


female
 officers,
 she
 picks
 up
 his


backpack.
 She
 doesn't
 ask
 for
 it.
 She


just
 grabs
 it,
 picks
 it
 up,
 and
 takes
 it


away
 from
 him
 and
 starts
 rooting
 around


in
 it
 and
 looking
 around
 and
 picking


through
 it.
 and
 she
 finds
 things
 such
 as


the
 gun
 and
 the
 ammunition
 as
 well
 as


his
 alleged
 diary,
 which
 the
 prosecution


has
 called
 a
 manifesto.
 But
 all
 this


evidence
 was
 done
 before
 they
 ever
 got
 a


search
 warrant.
 And
 the
 female
 officer


claimed
 that
 she
 was
 worried
 about
 him


having
 a
 bomb.
 So,
 she
 has
 to
 basically


take
 action
 to
 stop
 this
 potential
 bomb


from
 going
 off.
 But
 she
 never
 gets
 a


warrant
 and
 they
 don't
 get
 it
 according


to
 the
 defense
 for
 7
 hours.


>> 7
 hours
 is
 a
 long
 time
 by
 any
 standard.


And
 they
 wouldn't
 let
 him
 leave.
 They


even
 later
 took
 him
 into
 custody.
 They


questioned
 him,
 but
 they
 didn't
 read
 him


his
 Miranda
 rights
 until
 later.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it
 is
 pretty
 incredible


because
 apparently
 hours
 go
 by
 that
 he


was
 questioned
 and
 they
 got
 comments


from
 him,
 but
 they
 said
 that
 he
 wasn't


under
 arrest.
 They
 said
 like,
 "Don't


worry,
 you're
 not
 under
 arrest."
 But


then
 body
 cam
 footage
 shows
 that
 he's


initially
 approached
 by
 one
 of
 them.


He's
 asked
 if
 he's
 the
 shooter.
 He
 asks


him
 his
 name.
 He
 gives
 a
 different
 name.


And
 then
 they
 don't
 tell
 him
 anything.


an
 officer
 telling
 him
 he
 was
 100%
 sure


that
 Manion
 matched
 the
 suspect,
 but
 he


never
 said,
 "You're
 under
 arrest."
 And


then
 they
 surround
 him,
 according
 to
 the


video,
 and
 block
 him
 from
 leaving.
 And


they
 start
 questioning
 him.
 And
 I
 think


he'd
 already
 been
 sitting
 there.
 And


they
 said
 that
 he
 provoked
 concern


because
 he
 was
 there
 for
 40
 minutes
 and


that
 he
 could
 be
 charged
 with
 loitering,


but
 then
 they
 wouldn't
 let
 him
 leave.


And
 then
 one
 of
 the
 officers,
 another


officer
 tells
 one
 of
 the
 patrolmen,
 "You


should
 meandise
 him."
 And
 they
 still


didn't
 mirandise
 him
 until
 it
 seems
 much


later
 when
 they
 got
 to
 the
 station.


>> I
 mean,
 they're
 stopping
 him
 from


leaving.
 They
 have
 him
 in
 custody.


They're
 questioning
 him.
 It
 seems
 like


there
 are
 several
 points
 at
 which
 they


should
 have
 mirandized
 him,


>> right?
 And
 then
 basically
 he'd
 been


sitting
 there
 and
 they
 questioned
 him


and
 they
 started
 looking
 at
 his
 material


and
 all
 of
 this
 happened.
 So
 without
 a


warrant
 and
 without
 being
 mirandized,


they
 wouldn't
 let
 him
 leave
 and
 yet
 they


took
 him
 into
 custody,
 but
 they
 never


said
 you're
 you're
 under
 arrest
 and
 you


have
 the
 right
 to
 remain
 silent.
 So
 he


may
 have
 said
 incriminating
 statements,


but
 the
 defense
 is
 saying
 that
 they
 knew


they
 were
 going
 to
 get
 these
 statements


and
 they
 never
 bothered
 to
 meandise
 him.


You
 know,


>> I'm
 surprised
 that
 this
 hasn't
 come
 out


before.


>> Well,
 I
 guess
 what
 they're
 also
 getting


now
 is
 they
 have
 copies
 of
 the
 body
 cam


footage
 and
 in
 real
 time
 they
 can
 see


how
 it
 transpired
 and
 then
 they
 can
 have


to
 re-engineer
 backwards
 what
 happened


and
 what
 like
 the
 Tik
 Tok
 of
 what


happened.
 Suppose
 the
 judge
 doesn't


allow
 in
 the
 evidence
 from
 the
 backpack.


How
 much
 would
 that
 hurt
 the
 case?


It's
 quite
 a
 an
 ask
 by
 Luigi
 Manion's


lawyers
 to
 do
 this,
 but
 it
 does
 seem


like
 the
 fruits
 of
 an
 a
 tainted
 search,


right?
 And
 then
 if
 you
 question
 someone


and
 you
 didn't
 mirandize
 them,
 there
 are


cases
 that
 defense
 sites
 where
 this
 has


actually
 happened
 that
 there
 are
 other


cases
 where
 courts
 have
 thrown
 out


charges
 based
 on
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 wasn't


what
 the
 cops
 used
 to
 say
 when
 I
 covered


them,
 homicide
 cops,
 it
 wasn't


righteous.
 So
 unclear
 if
 they'll
 get


this
 request
 granted
 by
 the
 court,
 but


they
 have
 a
 pretty
 strong
 argument


whether
 or
 not
 this
 judge
 will
 do
 that.


Also,
 remember
 they're
 dealing
 with
 this


extraordinary
 circumstance
 that
 you
 have


the
 president
 of
 the
 United
 States
 and


high-ranking
 Justice
 Department


officials
 making
 comments.
 So,
 you
 know,


all
 of
 this
 might
 come
 together
 as
 a


package
 of
 troubling
 questions
 the
 judge


has.
 And
 Patty,
 just
 remind
 us
 about


what
 the
 judge
 instructed
 Justice


Department
 officials
 last
 month
 about


making
 those
 kind
 of
 incendiary


statements.
 The
 judge
 has
 basically


ordered
 the
 government
 to
 explain
 how


these
 statements
 got
 to
 be
 made.
 And
 to


remind
 you,
 um,
 there
 was
 a
 statement
 by


President
 Trump
 who
 said,
 "Man
 Gion,


quote,
 shot
 someone
 in
 the
 back
 as
 clear


as
 you're
 looking
 at
 me."
 as
 he
 told
 Fox


News.
 And
 um
 then
 a
 White
 House


affiliated
 exac
 account
 retweeted
 what


Trump
 said
 in
 a
 uh
 screenshot
 posting


with
 photo
 of
 Fox
 News
 and
 quoting


Trump.
 And
 then
 that
 post
 was
 retweeted


by
 the
 deputy
 director
 of
 the
 Department


of
 Justice
 of
 Public
 Affairs.
 And
 that


person
 said,
 you
 know,
 pus
 is
 absolutely


right
 on
 X.
 So
 then
 another
 person,
 the


White
 House
 press
 secretary
 again


repeated
 that
 she
 called
 him
 a
 left-wing


assassin
 who
 shot
 United
 Healthcare
 Bri


CEO
 Brian
 Thompson
 in
 the
 back.
 And
 she


says
 that
 from
 a
 White
 House
 briefing
 at


the
 White
 House.
 So,
 you
 know,
 his


lawyers
 are
 saying
 all
 these
 statements


is
 a
 confluence
 of
 negative
 statements


that
 are
 basically
 poisoning
 any


potential
 jury
 and
 it's
 harming
 his


rights
 to
 get
 a
 fair
 right
 to
 get
 a
 fair


trial
 because
 everyone
 will
 be
 so


prejudiced
 because
 look,
 the
 president


of
 the
 United
 States
 is
 saying
 these


things.
 The
 judge
 has
 asked
 for
 an


explanation
 and
 the
 government
 has


answered
 in
 a
 recent
 reply.
 Federal


prosecutors
 in
 the
 Southern
 District
 of


M
 in
 Manhattan
 have
 said
 it's
 nothing
 to


see
 here
 because
 technically
 the
 people


who
 made
 these
 comments
 are
 not


prosecutors
 on
 the
 case.


>> Okay?


>> So
 they're
 not
 addressing
 what
 Donald


Trump
 or
 anyone
 a
 DOJ
 or
 anybody
 in
 the


White
 House
 press
 secretary
 said.
 In
 a


case
 as
 big
 as
 this,
 you
 know,
 with
 so


much
 publicity
 on
 this
 case,
 it
 would


take
 a
 lot
 for
 the
 judge
 to,
 for


example,
 dismiss
 a
 charge
 or
 suppress


some
 of
 that
 crucial
 evidence
 like
 the


gun
 and
 ammunition.
 Although,
 I
 have
 to


say
 it
 does
 seem
 like
 the
 police
 didn't


follow
 proper
 procedures.
 You
 know,
 the


basics
 of
 mirandizing
 him.
 And
 if
 you


think
 there's
 a
 bomb
 in
 a
 backpack,


don't
 you
 call
 the
 bomb
 squad
 or
 do
 you


just
 rifle
 through
 the
 backpack?
 But


still,
 despite
 that,
 this
 is
 a
 huge


case.
 And
 I'm
 not
 sure
 what
 the
 judge


would
 be
 willing
 to
 do.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 definitely
 an
 attempt


by
 the
 defense
 to
 hamper
 whatever
 the


government's
 doing.
 And
 whether
 that


means
 carving
 out
 two
 charges,
 including


one
 that's
 death
 penalty
 eligible,
 that


obviously
 is
 this
 latest
 request,
 right?


They've
 already
 asked
 to
 dismiss
 the


indictment.
 They're
 saying
 they're


targeting
 specifically
 these
 two
 counts,


especially
 the
 death
 penalty
 eligible


count,
 which
 is
 count
 three.
 And
 then,


you
 know,
 it's
 a
 big
 ask.
 And
 I
 mean,


aside
 from
 those
 cases,
 rare
 cases
 cited


by
 the
 defense,
 it
 does
 seem


extraordinary
 that
 the
 judge
 would
 grant


it.
 But
 I
 think
 it's
 what
 their
 defense


is
 trying
 to
 do.
 They're
 give
 their
 best


shot,
 so
 to
 speak.
 You
 know,


>> if
 this
 were
 law
 and
 order,
 the
 judge


would
 grant
 it,
 though,
 uh,
 very


quickly.
 So,
 this
 is
 the
 federal
 case.


We
 also
 have
 the
 state
 case.
 Which
 is


going
 to
 go
 to
 trial
 first?


>> It's
 odd,
 but
 the
 state
 case,
 even


though
 it's
 allegedly
 going
 first,
 and


the
 state
 prosecutors
 have
 told
 the


judge
 in
 the
 state
 case,
 they're
 going


to
 have
 the
 first
 trial,
 it
 seems
 like


all
 systems
 are
 go
 with
 the
 defense


focusing
 on
 the
 federal
 case.
 Whether


that's
 because
 they're
 trying
 to
 attack


that
 first
 because
 they
 think
 that's
 the


best
 path
 to
 take,
 it's
 unclear.
 It


could
 be
 because
 they're
 focusing
 on
 the


death
 penalty
 and
 trying
 to
 knock
 that


out
 of
 the
 federal
 case.
 But
 I
 guess


we'll
 find
 out
 as
 it
 goes
 along.

 much,
