I'm
 about
 to
 break
 down
 everything
 you


need
 to
 know
 about
 tech
 job
 market
 in


2025
 including
 changes
 in
 the
 labor


market
 skill
 requirements
 AI
 influence


and
 changes
 in
 the
 talent
 acquisition


strategies
 companies
 are
 racing
 to
 the


office
 AI
 has
 taken
 over
 performance


review
 younger
 generation
 is
 not
 willing


to
 step
 into
 managerial
 roles
 and
 that


fake
 it
 till
 you
 make
 it
 mentality
 is


finally
 on
 the
 decline
 and
 if
 you're


still
 writing
 your
 resume
 with
 Chad
 gbt


you
 need
 to
 listen
 to
 this
 hopefully
 I


can
 convince
 you
 to
 rethink
 it
 hi


everybody
 this
 is


area
 we're
 going
 to
 start
 with
 hiring


optimism
 and
 labor
 market
 resilience


based
 on
 the
 available
 information
 in


2025
 we
 will
 be
 shifting
 towards
 a
 more


balanced
 labor
 market
 rather
 than


continuing
 being
 in
 a
 strong
 employers


Market
 in
 the
 past
 3
 years
 several


factors
 contribute
 to
 this
 76%
 of


employers
 plan
 to
 expand
 their
 headcount


in
 2025
 according
 to
 a
 zip
 recruiter


survey
 the
 job
 market
 is
 expected
 to
 to


see
 the
 net
 growth
 of
 7%
 in
 total


employment
 or
 78
 million
 jobs
 between


2025
 and
 2030
 job
 postings
 remain
 to
 be


in
 the
 prepandemic
 level
 in
 many
 sectors


indicating
 sustained
 demand
 for
 workers


however
 despite
 the
 cooling
 Trends
 there


are
 signs
 of
 continued
 labor
 market


strength
 and
 employers
 optimism
 the


market
 is
 still
 very
 saturated
 there
 is


lots
 of
 political
 uncertainty
 especially


North
 America
 and
 if
 we
 take
 into


consideration
 the
 Tariff
 Wars
 that
 may


or
 may
 not
 happen
 lots
 of
 people
 are


still
 holding
 on
 to
 their
 jobs
 in


anticipation
 of
 upcoming
 economic


changes
 that
 may
 or
 may
 not
 follow
 as


the
 consequence
 of
 potential
 tariff
 Wars


I
 cannot
 emphasize
 this
 enough


everything
 you're
 doing
 career-wise
 has


to
 be
 viewed
 through
 the
 lens
 of
 current


market
 conditions
 if
 you're
 feeling
 like


you're
 behind
 and
 you're
 looking
 at
 a


friend
 who
 has
 a
 job
 at
 Big
 Tech
 always


ask
 when
 and
 how
 they
 got
 that
 job
 if


you
 are
 trying
 to
 break
 into
 Fang
 and


nothing's
 working
 for
 you
 you
 should
 not


be
 talking
 to
 somebody
 who
 got
 that
 job


in
 2018
 or
 even
 in
 2020
 that
 is
 an


entirely
 different
 Universe
 the


conditions
 of
 the
 job
 market
 that
 were


present
 when
 your
 friend
 entered
 big


Tech
 were
 polar
 opposite
 to
 where
 we
 are


today
 if
 your
 friend
 had
 big
 logos


before
 they
 got
 into
 Fang
 again
 that
 is


a
 very
 different
 situation
 from
 what


you're
 facing
 right
 now
 number
 two


growing
 skill
 shortages
 skill
 shortages


have
 been
 a
 significant
 problem
 for


employers
 and
 recruitment
 teams
 for
 a


while
 however
 the
 rapid
 pace
 of


technological
 progress
 has
 made
 matters


worse
 leaving
 business
 scrambling
 to


find
 workers
 with
 the
 right
 skills
 we


are
 slowly
 moving
 away
 from
 the
 era
 of


generalists
 overcoming
 skill
 shortages


in
 2025
 will
 require
 a
 multifaceted


approach
 from
 the
 business
 side


businesses
 will
 continue
 expanding
 their


talent
 pools
 tapping
 into
 to
 passive


candidates
 recent
 graduates
 and
 remote


employees
 at
 the
 same
 time
 businesses


will
 take
 a
 comprehensive
 approach
 to


investing
 in
 continuous
 training
 and


skill
 development
 of
 their
 employees
 now


take
 this
 from
 your
 employer
 if
 they're


offering
 that
 I
 see
 so
 many
 people


around
 me
 who
 are
 not
 taking
 advantage


of
 what
 their
 companies
 are
 offering


them
 there
 are
 budgets
 allocated
 for


your
 skill
 development
 and
 if
 the


company's
 not
 forcing
 you
 to
 do
 it
 you


should
 be
 proactive
 about
 it
 because


that's
 free
 money
 free
 you
 also
 consider


the
 company's
 willingness
 to
 invest
 in


your
 education
 when
 making
 your
 next


move
 especially
 if
 your
 early
 career


here's
 an
 example
 from
 my
 own
 experience


I
 worked
 at
 a
 company
 that
 promised
 that


they
 would
 make
 investments
 into
 my


education
 and
 skill
 development
 when
 I


was
 accepting
 their
 offer
 the
 promises


were
 very
 generic
 they
 were
 not


documented
 they
 were
 just
 verbal


promises
 but
 when
 I
 joined
 the
 company


it
 turned
 out
 that
 every
 team
 got


allocated
 a
 certain
 budget
 and
 that


budget
 was
 split
 between
 the
 number
 of


members
 on
 every
 team
 so
 if
 your
 team


got
 $1,000
 and
 you
 had
 10
 employees
 on


the
 team
 every
 single
 one
 of
 you
 would


get
 only
 $100
 and
 $100
 is
 nothing
 for
 a


good
 quality
 education
 and
 I
 got
 offered


$500
 a
 year
 which
 in
 the
 end
 was
 not


enough
 even
 for
 one
 course
 at
 reforge
 so


if
 skill
 development
 is
 something
 that


matters
 to
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 it's


stipulated
 in
 your
 contract
 number
 three


rise
 of
 individual
 contributors
 in
 Tech


this
 is
 the
 most
 interesting
 Trend
 and


the
 one
 I'm
 incredibly
 excited
 about


because
 I
 no
 longer
 feel
 like
 a
 fraud


before
 I
 talk
 about
 it
 I
 want
 to
 give
 a


very
 quick
 example
 from
 a
 personal


experience
 I
 never
 wanted
 to
 become
 a


manager
 I
 never
 had
 this
 ambition
 and
 I


never
 looked
 at
 people
 managers
 as


someone
 I
 aspired
 to
 be
 one
 day
 and
 that


is
 because
 the
 way
 I
 thought
 about
 being


a
 people
 manager
 is
 that
 I
 think
 it


should
 be
 given
 to
 people
 who
 truly
 are


earned
 it
 not
 waited
 out
 long
 enough
 at


the
 company
 and
 then
 everybody
 else
 left


and
 you
 were
 the
 only
 candidate
 for
 the


job
 but
 because
 they
 actually
 earned
 it


with
 their
 intelligent
 quantifiable


outcomes
 and
 a
 very
 high
 level
 of


emotional
 intelligence
 that
 would
 give


you
 an
 ability
 to
 lead
 other
 people
 to


me
 this
 job
 comes
 with
 numerous


responsibilities
 and
 very
 high
 level
 of


stress
 and
 I
 personally
 would
 rather


spend
 that
 time
 investing
 in
 my
 skills


and
 my
 own
 personal
 development
 as
 a


product
 management
 professional
 rather


than
 coaching
 others
 I
 always
 thought


that
 a
 person
 becoming
 a
 manager
 has
 to


be
 incredibly
 skilled
 they
 have
 to
 be


very
 good
 at
 what
 they
 do
 already
 and


they
 have
 to
 be
 very
 good
 at
 leading


other
 people
 however
 historically
 and
 up


until
 very
 recently
 the
 standard


progression
 in
 most
 corporate
 rules


including
 Tech
 was
 Junior
 intermediate


senior
 manager
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 expected


that
 you
 would
 eventually
 become
 a


manager
 once
 you
 are
 doing
 well
 enough


in
 your
 senior
 role
 as
 an
 individual


contributor
 and
 even
 when
 I
 was
 younger


just
 starting
 my
 career
 I
 kept
 thinking


what
 I
 would
 do
 when
 I
 passed
 the
 senior


level
 because
 I
 never
 wanted
 to
 be
 a


manager
 my
 goal
 has
 always
 been
 to
 gain


very
 intense
 competence
 in
 what
 I
 do
 I


do
 not
 abide
 by
 tactics
 where
 you


document
 every
 single
 thing
 you
 do


during
 the
 day
 and
 then
 you
 create
 a


larger
 than
 life
 story
 for
 your


management
 team
 and
 then
 you
 start


working
 for
 those
 Optics
 and
 that's
 how


you
 make
 your
 way
 into
 the
 managerial


role
 climbing
 that
 corporate
 ladder
 by


not
 being
 intensely
 competent
 but
 by


knowing
 who
 to
 talk
 to
 and
 who
 to
 show


your
 face
 to
 because
 I
 think
 that
 even


if
 you
 manage
 to
 build
 a
 career
 by
 being


very
 tactical
 and
 very
 calculated
 about


your
 moves
 and
 things
 that
 you
 do


eventually
 your
 lack
 of
 skill
 will
 show


there
 is
 nothing
 I
 hate
 more
 than
 this


freaking
 expression
 fake
 it
 till
 you


make
 it
 I
 think
 that
 we
 as
 a
 society


have
 a
 lot
 of
 problems
 on
 a
 global
 level


because
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that


are
 very
 good
 at
 faking
 it
 I
 had
 the


same
 perception
 of
 a
 role
 of
 a


consultant
 like
 a
 business
 consultant
 at


Deo
 or
 Mackenzie
 I
 thought
 you
 had
 to
 be


insanely
 competent
 to
 land
 a
 role
 there


I
 thought
 that
 being
 a
 consultant
 well


the
 word
 consultant
 implies
 that
 you
 are


Consulting
 somebody
 on
 how
 to
 do


business
 business
 and
 probably
 after
 20


or
 25
 years
 of
 proven
 success
 you
 are


invited
 by
 a
 consulting
 company
 to
 do


that
 work
 and
 then
 there
 is
 a
 customer


who
 is
 willing
 to
 pay
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 for


your
 experience
 and
 knowledge
 and
 your


way
 of
 thinking
 that
 you're
 now
 allowed


to
 consult
 a
 massive
 business
 on
 how
 to


grow
 or
 how
 to
 transform
 yeah
 that
 was


until
 I
 had
 a
 chance
 to
 spend
 more


people
 from
 the
 Consulting
 World
 working


at
 those
 top
 five
 Consulting
 firms
 and


my
 perception
 of
 this
 job
 just
 shattered


so
 anyway
 back
 to
 the
 topic
 I
 am
 so


excited
 about
 the
 rise
 of
 career
 paths


for
 individual
 contributors
 roles
 such


as
 principal
 PM
 in
 my
 case
 but
 it
 could


be
 any
 other
 job
 principal
 level
 staff


level
 group
 level
 directors
 senior


directors
 VPS
 without
 direct
 reports


they're
 going
 to
 be
 making
 just
 as
 much


as
 our
 counterparts
 who
 have
 reports


except
 their
 focus
 will
 be
 on
 the


competency
 and
 the
 experience
 in
 their


specific
 field
 rather
 than
 people


management
 this
 is
 still
 very
 rare
 but


we
 are
 going
 to
 be
 seeing
 the
 rise
 of


individual
 contributor
 roles
 in
 the
 next


5
 years
 and
 I'm
 very
 excited
 for
 people


including
 myself
 who
 want
 to
 build


competence
 in
 their
 specific
 field


rather
 than
 working
 on
 the
 people


management
 skills
 because
 this
 gives
 me


a
 lot
 of
 Hope
 for
 the
 future
 companies


are
 starting
 to
 create
 dedicated
 career


paths
 for
 individual
 contributors


allowing
 them
 to
 progress
 and
 to
 be


rewarded
 for
 their
 Tech
 technical


expertise
 without
 necessarily
 moving


into
 management
 this
 trend
 recognizes


the
 value
 of
 deep
 subject
 expertise


remember
 the
 skill
 shortages
 we
 talked


about
 earlier
 and
 encourages
 retention


of
 top
 talent
 we're
 going
 to
 start


seeing
 the
 creation
 of
 co-director
 roles


where
 one
 director
 focuses
 on
 people


management
 responsibilities
 such
 as


performance
 reviews
 vacation
 discussion


compensation
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth
 and
 the


other
 director
 guides
 you
 within
 the


area
 that
 you
 specialize
 in
 now
 let's


talk
 about
 Ai
 and
 Bots
 versus
 people


employers
 are
 embracing
 the
 idea
 that
 II


tools
 can
 increase
 fairness
 in
 their


workplace
 and
 highlight
 the


contributions
 that
 people
 managers
 could


miss
 in
 a
 more
 traditional
 performance


management
 managers
 will
 still
 finalize


the
 final
 decisions
 as
 the
 human
 in
 the


loop
 validating
 and
 verifying
 the
 bot's


recommendations
 but
 for
 more
 everyday


activities
 such
 as
 in
 the-
 moment


performance
 review
 Bots
 are
 likely
 to


take
 on
 an
 increasing
 share
 of
 manager


tasks
 especially
 for
 work
 that
 is


digitally
 based
 I
 expect
 that
 going


forward
 we
 will
 be
 seeing
 increased
 use


of
 AI
 in
 scheduling
 feedback
 performance


reviews
 and
 promotion
 and
 hiring


decisions
 a
 June
 2024
 Gardener
 survey


suggested
 that
 more
 than
 3,300
 employees


revealed
 that
 57%
 believe
 that
 humans


are
 way
 more
 biased
 than
 AI
 when
 it


comes
 to
 making
 compensation
 decisions


an
 October
 2024
 Gardener
 survey
 of


nearly
 3500
 100
 employees
 suggested
 that


87%
 of
 employees
 think
 that
 algorithm


could
 give
 fairer
 feedback
 than
 their


managers
 right
 now
 now
 what
 does
 this


mean
 for
 you
 if
 you
 have
 those
 systems


at
 work
 where
 your
 manager
 asks
 you
 to


fill
 out
 your
 weekly
 summary
 every


Friday
 what
 you've
 done
 what
 you've


achieved
 things
 like
 that
 do
 it
 and
 be


very
 diligent
 about
 it
 because
 that
 data


points
 are
 going
 to
 be
 fed
 to
 AI
 agents


that
 will
 be
 processing
 your
 feedback


every
 single
 week
 and
 that
 is
 exactly


what's
 going
 to
 be
 helping
 you
 in
 your


next
 performance
 review
 and
 conversation


about
 your
 bonus
 and
 compensation
 do
 not


neglect
 those
 things
 I
 know
 this
 has


been
 said
 many
 times
 that
 you
 should
 be


documenting
 all
 of
 your
 achievements


throughout
 the
 year
 so
 you
 can
 properly


fill
 out
 documentation
 at
 the
 end
 of
 it


but
 you
 should
 be
 doing
 it
 a
 lot
 more


because
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 data
 will
 be


processed
 not
 by
 your
 direct
 manager
 but


by
 the
 AI
 tools
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 be


putting
 to
 use
 and
 this
 leads
 me
 to
 my


next
 Point
 what
 changes
 are
 we
 going
 to


be
 seeing
 in
 Talent
 acquisition


strategies
 going
 forward
 AI
 will
 be
 used


a
 lot
 in
 identifying
 which
 resumés
 will


make
 it
 through
 to
 the
 interview
 round
 I


hope
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 explain
 to
 anybody


that
 AI
 can
 detect
 AI
 please
 do
 not
 use


Chad
 GPT
 or
 CLA
 blindly
 to
 write
 your


resumés
 and
 where
 you
 simply
 copy
 and


paste
 I
 feel
 like
 this
 is
 such
 an


obvious
 thing
 and
 should
 go
 without


saying
 but
 I
 personally
 have
 seen
 so


many
 rumes
 last
 year
 that
 were
 written


entirely
 by
 Chad
 from
 start
 to
 finish


without
 changing
 a
 word
 AI
 tends
 to


generalize
 AI
 tends
 to
 exaggerate
 AI


isn't
 always
 accurate
 and
 the
 info
 needs


to
 be
 reviewed
 and
 fact
 checked
 don't


rely
 on
 it
 blindly
 to
 write
 a
 document


that
 starts
 your
 entire
 relationship


with
 a
 potential
 employer
 the
 labor


market
 is
 going
 to
 be
 adapting
 to
 new


realities
 there
 is
 a
 trend
 towards
 the


hybrid
 work
 with
 40%
 of
 employers


supporting
 mixed
 Arrangements


skill-based
 pay
 is
 gaining
 momentum


particular
 particularly
 in
 high
 demand


Fields
 like
 AI
 cyber
 security
 and
 data


science
 the
 great
 Office
 return
 there's


going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 shift
 toward
 hybrid


work
 models
 with
 40%
 of
 employers


supporting
 the
 mixed
 model
 with
 fully


remote
 work
 declined
 to
 7%
 from
 21%
 in


2024
 companies
 will
 be
 requiring
 in


office
 Presence
 at
 least
 3
 days
 a
 week


companies
 requiring
 in
 office
 presence


will
 increase
 to
 53%
 compared
 to
 37%


last
 year
 many
 major
 companies
 are


implementing
 stricter
 return
 to
 office


policies
 in
 2025
 for
 example
 as
 you've


probably
 heard
 Amazon
 is
 requiring
 a


5day
 in-office
 presence
 starting
 January


2025
 marking
 a
 significant
 shift
 from


their
 previous
 hybrid
 model
 AT&T
 is


requiring
 all
 staff
 to
 work
 on
 site
 5


days
 a
 week
 beginning
 January
 2025
 JP


Morgan
 increase
 in
 office
 presence


requirement
 to
 3
 days
 a
 week
 with
 senior


leaders
 being
 on
 site
 five
 days
 a
 week


this
 trend
 is
 not
 isolated
 to
 large


companies
 KPMG
 survey
 from
 2025
 confirms


that
 83%
 of
 CEOs
 expect
 a
 full
 return
 to


office
 within
 the
 next
 3
 years
 if
 your


company
 is
 offering
 a
 fuller
 remote


setup
 think
 twice
 before
 changing
 rules


a
 lot
 of
 people
 got
 accustomed
 to
 being


at
 home
 5
 days
 a
 week
 and
 if
 that
 is


something
 that
 matters
 to
 you
 be
 careful


when
 you
 look
 for
 a
 new
 job
 the
 majority


of
 new
 rules
 require
 some
 degree
 of
 in


office
 presence
 now
 onto
 the
 factors


that
 are
 driving
 this
 shift


collaboration
 and
 Innovation
 many


Executives
 believe
 that
 in-person
 office


culture
 Foster
 better
 collaboration
 and


Innovation
 there
 is
 a
 growing
 concern


about
 maintaining
 and
 strengthening


corporate
 culture
 in
 a
 remote


environment
 there
 are
 productivity


concerns
 some
 leaders
 argue
 that


in-office
 work
 leads
 to
 higher


productivity
 and
 higher
 engagement


across
 all
 teams
 although
 this
 remains
 a


point
 of
 debate
 economic
 uncertainty
 in


the
 times
 of
 economic
 instability


companies
 prefer
 more
 direct
 oversight


of
 their
 Workforce
 hybrid
 work
 is
 often


seen
 as
 a
 compromise
 that
 offers


flexibility
 while
 maintaining
 some


in-person
 collaboration
 interestingly


hybrid
 workers
 often
 report
 feeling
 more


connected
 to
 their
 teams
 and
 their
 work


compared
 to
 those
 who
 work
 exclusively


in
 person
 or
 exclusively
 remote
 now


those
 factors
 are
 being
 listed
 as


drivers
 of
 this
 shift
 across
 multiple


reports
 and
 frankly
 at
 this
 point
 I


personally
 think
 that
 it
 doesn't
 even


matter
 whether
 whether
 you
 agree
 or
 not


with
 those
 factors
 I
 personally
 disagree


with
 half
 of
 them
 but
 I
 don't
 think


those
 opinions
 are
 going
 to
 be
 taken


into
 consideration
 companies
 are
 rapidly


shifting
 to
 a
 hybrid
 model
 and
 even
 the


ones
 who
 have
 been
 remote
 for
 years
 are


now
 asking
 employees
 to
 show
 up
 at
 least


twice
 a
 week
 and
 the
 last
 trend
 is


around
 Wellness
 Centric
 employment


mental
 health
 and
 overall
 well-being


continues
 to
 be
 a
 trend


and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 central


components
 of
 talent
 acquisition


strategies
 organizations
 are
 developing


comprehensive
 Wellness
 plans
 Beyond


traditional
 health
 benefits
 so
 you
 will


start
 seeing
 more
 budget
 allocated


towards
 mental
 health
 days
 therapy
 and


meditation
 this
 shift
 reflects
 a
 deeper


understanding
 that
 top
 talent


increasingly
 prioritizes
 organizations


that
 demonstrate
 genuine
 commitment
 to


employee
 well-being
 I
 hope
 this
 was


helpful
 if
 there
 are
 any
 Trends
 I


haven't
 mentioned
 please
 mention
 them


below
 I'm
 happy
 to
 continue
 this


conversation
 I
 am
 personally
 semi


excited
 for
 what's
 about
 to
 happen
 in


the
 next
 5
 years
 I've
 enjoyed
 the
 fullly


remote
 setup
 for
 many
 years
 and


personally
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 that
 it


impacted
 my
 productivity
 but
 I
 am
 very


curious
 to
 hear
 about
 what
 you
 guys


think
 let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 comments
 till


next
 time
 bye
