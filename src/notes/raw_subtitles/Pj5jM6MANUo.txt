When I was younger,
I worked in the oil industry.
I was a corporate lawyer
inside one of the biggest
oil companies in the world.
Then one day,
in the middle of a massive deal,
a colleague said to me,
"This is so sexy."
And I knew I had to leave.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So I did.
I went back to my home country,
Guyana, South America.
Guyana is a very special place.
It's a carbon sink.
It's part of the Amazon rainforest.
I started to work
defending people and nature.
I drafted new laws
to protect the environment
and Indigenous land rights.
I used those laws to empower
an Indigenous community
so that they could protect
2,300 square miles of tropical forest.
(Applause)
This was really important to me
because I feel deeply connected to nature.
Nature lives with me
in my house and in my garden.
I'm talking about the birds,
the butterflies, the flowers,
the trees, the bees, the bats, the toads,
the lizards, the opossums,
the little snakes.
All of them are my family.
And in the quiet stillness of an afternoon
when a hummingbird shimmers in the air
just a few feet away from me,
I know there is magic on Earth.
But that magic is threatened
by global overheating
caused by greenhouse gas pollution
from the fossil fuel industry.
So the story I want to tell you now
takes us back to the oil industry.
But this time it's a story
of fighting and winning.
(Cheers and applause)
The story begins in 2015,
when ExxonMobil said
they had found oil offshore Guyana.
This is one of the biggest finds
in recent times.
More than 11 billion barrels of oil.
Burning that could release
five billion tons
of greenhouse gas pollution.
This Guyana field
is so important to Exxon,
they call it a jewel in their crown.
I knew I had to do something.
I know what you're thinking.
The oil industry is big.
It's powerful.
We've all seen how hard it is
to go up against oil companies.
They want you to believe
that you can't fight them.
But you can.
And you can win.
I'm doing it, and so can you.
The oil industry does not care about you,
or human rights or the environment
or the planet.
The oil industry cares about money.
The only thing they respond to is power.
Law is power.
I'm a lawyer.
I use law.
(Cheers and applause)
When I first started this work,
I was alone.
People laughed at me
for taking on the oil industry
with no money
and with a pensioner for a client.
But I have filed ten cases
against the oil,
and good, courageous lawyers
have been inspired to join this fight.
We first beat ExxonMobil in 2020.
We cut ExxonMobil Guyana's permits
down from 20 years to five years.
(Cheers and applause)
We managed to do this
because I read through 197 pages
of legal rules and regulations,
and there, on page 191, was a rule
that restricted environmental
permits to five years.
We just enforced that rule.
Simple but effective.
I don't ask judges to make new laws.
I don't use moral arguments.
I use existing law.
My heart tells me what to do,
but my head tells me how to do it.
I don't confuse the two.
(Cheers and applause)
Our most recent win was March 2025.
We said the environmental
impact assessment
for Exxon's project
to extract oil from Guyana
should take into account all the pollution
anywhere in the world,
wherever that oil is burned,
what we call Scope 3 emissions.
We used a section of the law
that I had drafted
which said an environmental impact
assessment must include indirect impacts.
We said Scope 3 emissions
are indirect impacts.
The judge agreed.
So the environmental impact assessment
for that ExxonMobil Guyana project
now has to take into account
Scope 3 emissions,
which makes it harder
to justify doing oil.
That decision sets a precedent.
It applies to every project
by ExxonMobil Guyana,
and it applies to every company
that wants to produce oil from Guyana.
(Applause)
Thank you.
We all know oil production
is a very dangerous exercise.
When things go wrong,
someone has to pay.
And this brings me
to our most significant case so far.
We said Guyana should not have to pay
for harm caused by Exxon's drilling.
We said Exxon should pay.
The judge agreed with us.
He said ExxonMobil Guyana Limited
is liable for all costs of cleaning up
and restoring the environment
and compensating people.
And he said that liability is unlimited.
(Applause)
That could be billions of dollars.
The judge said ExxonMobil Guyana Limited
did not have the money
to cover this potential liability,
so he ordered an unlimited
parent company guarantee.
In the two weeks following this decision,
ExxonMobil Corporation's
share price declined by 12 percent.
(Cheers and applause)
We've had other successes.
The courts have said
ExxonMobil Guyana Limited
has to comply with international law.
They have to provide insurance.
They have to provide
a two-billion-dollar guarantee.
The courts have even said
that ExxonMobil Guyana's co-venturers,
Hess Guyana and CNOOC,
Chinese National Offshore
Oil Corporation Guyana,
are not allowed to use
their petroleum production license
to produce oil.
Of course, we don't always win.
The first case I filed
was for someone I met
when I accidentally crashed
into him on my bicycle.
He was an advisor
to the President of Guyana.
His reputation was so fierce,
his nickname was Rambo.
(Laughter)
Twenty years later,
Rambo turned up in my office,
now a 75-year-old pensioner,
absolutely furious with ExxonMobil
and determined to fight.
I took the case.
The judges did not give us
the ruling we asked for,
but we still achieved
something really significant.
In many countries around the world,
if you go to court and you lose,
you could end up paying
the other side's costs.
That could be very expensive.
People might be afraid to go to court.
We changed that.
In our case,
the judges said,
if you come to court
and you are protecting the environment,
but you lose,
you should not have to pay
the costs for the other side.
That makes it easier.
(Applause)
That makes it easier
for people to go to court now
and fight the oil industry.
That decision already
binds five countries.
I hope that people outside
of those five countries
will take this judgment
and will use it to persuade
the judges in their countries
that you should be able
to fight for your planet
and not be penalized if you lose in court.
We will continue to fight.
We don't have a choice.
The business model for the oil industry
depends upon producing
greenhouse gas pollution,
which is a serious danger
to life on Earth.
It's them or us.
So ...
Don't be fooled by the big bad image
of the oil industry.
We have the advantage.
The oil industry is weak.
Itâ€™s powerless.
It's going to collapse.
It's only a question of when.
Of course,
they want you to feel despair.
They want you to feel
as if you're powerless.
But they can only do that if we let them.
When we fight
with courage and intelligence,
we beat the oil industry.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
