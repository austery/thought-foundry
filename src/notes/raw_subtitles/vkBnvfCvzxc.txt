From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Thursday,
 October
 16th.
 Here's
 what


we're
 covering.


[Music]


>> What's
 the
 next
 step
 in
 this
 war
 on


cartels?
 And
 are
 you
 considering


options?
 Are
 you
 considering
 strikes
 on


land?
 And


>> well,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 tell
 you
 exactly,


but
 we
 are
 certainly
 looking
 at
 land
 now


because
 we've
 got
 the
 sea
 very
 well


under
 control.
 At
 the
 White
 House


yesterday,
 President
 Trump
 said
 that
 the


US
 is
 considering
 military
 strikes
 on


Venezuela
 as
 the
 administration
 steps
 up


its
 pressure
 campaign
 against
 the


country's
 authoritarian
 leader,
 Nicholas


Maduro.
 In
 recent
 weeks,
 the
 US
 military


has
 attacked
 at
 least
 five
 boats
 off
 the


coast
 of
 Venezuela,
 killing
 27
 people.


The
 administration
 has
 claimed
 without


offering
 evidence
 that
 the
 boats
 were


smuggling
 drugs
 to
 the
 US
 and
 has


denounced
 Maduro
 as
 a
 narco
 terrorist.


Yesterday,
 Trump
 said
 he'd
 also


authorized
 the
 CIA
 to
 conduct
 covert


actions
 in
 Venezuela.


>> We've
 had
 signals
 for
 a
 while
 now
 that


the
 US
 is
 prepared
 to
 escalate.
 They've


cut
 off
 diplomatic
 talks
 with
 Venezuela.


They
 have
 brought
 in
 more
 and
 more


troops
 into
 the
 region,
 more
 and
 more


naval
 ships.
 There's
 a
 big
 military


buildup.
 And
 so
 the
 authorization
 for


covert
 action
 is
 part
 of
 this
 larger


march
 to
 a
 military
 and
 intelligence


engagement
 in
 Venezuela.


>> Julian
 Barnes
 covers
 the
 CIA
 for
 the


Times.


>> Privately,
 US
 officials
 have
 told
 us


that
 ultimately
 removing
 Maduro
 from


power
 is
 the
 goal
 of
 this
 campaign.
 It's


not
 simply
 to
 stop
 the
 drug
 boats.
 It's


not
 simply
 to
 get
 Venezuela
 to
 do
 more


to
 intercept
 drugs
 coming
 through
 its


country.
 It
 is
 about
 removing
 Maduro


from
 power.


>> Julian
 says
 it's
 unknown
 what,
 if
 any,


operations
 the
 CIA
 is
 planning
 in


Venezuela,
 though
 the
 AY's
 director


promised
 during
 his
 confirmation
 hearing


that
 the
 CIA
 would
 become
 more


aggressive
 under
 his
 leadership.
 In
 a


statement,
 Venezuela
 accused
 Trump
 of


trying
 to
 quote
 legitimize
 regime
 change


and
 said
 it
 plans
 to
 raise
 the
 matter


with
 the
 UN
 Security
 Council
 today.


The
 Times
 has
 learned
 that
 the
 White


House
 is
 considering
 radically


overhauling
 the
 US
 refugee
 system
 into


one
 that
 would
 favor
 white
 people.
 For


decades,
 the
 program
 has
 been
 aimed
 at


helping
 the
 world's
 most
 vulnerable


people,
 often
 fleeing
 war,
 or
 other


crises,
 whether
 that's
 in
 Syria,
 Haiti,


Ukraine,
 Afghanistan.
 But
 on
 his
 first


day
 in
 office,
 President
 Trump
 suspended


all
 refugee
 admissions
 and
 asked
 his


administration
 to
 draw
 proposals
 for
 how


they
 thought
 the
 program
 should
 run.
 The


Times
 got
 access
 to
 some
 of
 those
 plans,


which
 argue
 that
 the
 previous
 refugee


system
 made
 the
 US
 too
 diverse.
 One


proposal
 said
 the
 administration
 should


only
 welcome
 quote
 refugees
 who
 can
 be


fully
 and
 appropriately
 assimilated
 and


are
 aligned
 with
 the
 president's


objectives.
 The
 proposals
 also
 call
 for


Trump
 to
 prioritize
 Europeans
 who
 it


claims
 have
 been
 targeted
 for
 speaking


out
 against
 things
 like
 mass
 migration.


Trump
 already
 offered
 priority
 refugee


status
 to
 Africconers,
 the
 white


minority
 in
 South
 Africa,
 claiming
 they


face
 racial
 persecution
 there.
 A


spokesman
 for
 the
 State
 Department
 would


not
 comment
 on
 specific
 details
 in
 the


proposals,
 but
 said
 this
 administration


unapologetically
 prioritizes
 the


interests
 of
 the
 American
 people.

Now,
 two
 more
 quick
 updates
 on
 the
 Trump


administration.


Yesterday
 at
 the
 Pentagon,
 a
 procession


of
 reporters
 handed
 in
 their
 press


passes
 after
 rejecting
 new
 rules
 that


Defense
 Secretary
 Pete
 Hegsath
 laid
 out


for
 how
 they
 can
 do
 their
 work.
 Several


lawyers
 representing
 media
 organizations


said
 the
 new
 rules
 violate
 the
 First


Amendment
 and
 that
 under
 them,
 reporters


could
 have
 been
 punished
 for
 simply


doing
 their
 jobs.
 The
 rejection
 was


nearly
 unanimous
 among
 news
 outlets
 that


cover
 the
 Defense
 Department,
 including


the
 Times,
 NBC,
 and
 Fox
 News.
 They
 will


no
 longer
 have
 physical
 access
 to
 the


Pentagon.


and
 a
 federal
 judge
 has
 temporarily


blocked
 the
 Trump
 administration
 from


carrying
 out
 mass
 layoffs
 during
 the


government
 shutdown.
 In
 her
 decision,


the
 judge
 wrote
 that
 the
 White
 House


budget
 office
 has
 taken
 advantage
 of
 the


ongoing
 shutdown
 to
 quote
 assume
 that


all
 bets
 are
 off
 that
 the
 laws
 don't


apply
 to
 them
 anymore.
 Unions


representing
 federal
 workers
 had
 sued


over
 the
 firings
 after
 the
 government


started
 sending
 out
 layoff
 notices
 to


more
 than
 4,000
 employees.
 Still,
 the


administration
 does
 not
 seem
 phased
 by


the
 judge's
 ruling
 and
 has
 threatened
 to


fire
 more
 workers.


>> Are
 we
 talking
 a
 thousand
 people?
 We


talking


>> We're
 definitely
 talking
 people.
 We're


definitely
 talking
 thousands
 of
 people.


>> The
 head
 of
 the
 White
 House
 budget


office,
 Russell
 Vote,
 said
 on
 a
 podcast


yesterday
 that
 the
 number
 of
 layoffs


could
 more
 than
 double,


>> but
 it
 could
 grow
 much
 higher.


>> It
 could
 grow
 higher.
 I
 think
 we'll


probably
 end
 up
 being
 north
 of
 10,000.

In
 Gaza
 last
 night,
 Hamas
 announced
 that


it
 has
 handed
 over
 all
 of
 the
 remains
 of


Israeli
 hostages
 that
 it's
 currently


able
 to,
 saying
 there
 are
 some
 it
 can't


reach
 because
 Israeli
 strikes
 have


reduced
 so
 much
 of
 Gaza
 to
 rubble.
 Under


the
 terms
 of
 the
 current
 ceasefire


between
 Israel
 and
 Hamas,
 Hamas
 was


expected
 to
 immediately
 hand
 over
 more


than
 20
 bodies
 of
 people
 taken
 captive


on
 October
 7th,
 2023.
 At
 the
 moment,


it's
 returned
 10,
 saying
 it
 needs


specialized
 equipment
 to
 recover
 the


rest.
 The
 terms
 of
 the
 deal
 acknowledged


that
 this
 kind
 of
 situation
 was
 possible


given
 the
 destruction
 in
 the
 territory,


but
 it's
 not
 yet
 clear
 if
 Israel
 and
 the


US
 will
 interpret
 Hamas's
 delay
 in


returning
 the
 bodies,
 as
 a
 violation
 of


the
 peace
 agreement.


Meanwhile,
 after
 2
 years
 of
 operating
 in


the
 shadows,
 often
 literally


underground,
 armed
 uniformed
 members
 of


Hamas
 are
 now
 being
 seen
 on
 the
 streets


in
 Gaza.
 The
 group
 appears
 to
 be
 trying


to
 restore
 some
 semblance
 of
 public


order.
 For
 example,
 in
 one
 city,
 they've


been
 outdirecting
 traffic
 this
 week.


Hamas
 also
 seems
 to
 be
 trying
 to
 show


it's
 still
 the
 dominant
 force
 in
 Gaza
 by


cracking
 down
 on
 small
 rival
 militias


that
 have
 sprung
 up
 in
 the
 past
 few


months.
 Israel
 has
 supported
 some
 of


those
 groups,
 even
 providing
 one
 with


weapons
 to
 fight
 Hamas
 on
 its
 behalf.


Earlier
 this
 week,
 Hamas's
 crackdown
 led


to
 a
 bloody
 gun
 battle
 in
 Gaza
 City.
 And


later,
 masked
 fighters
 lined
 up
 and
 shot


eight
 people
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 a
 crowded


street
 there
 in
 what
 one
 Hamas
 official


told
 the
 Times
 was
 an
 execution
 of
 its


enemies.

And
 finally,
 the
 American
 penny
 is


likely
 the
 most
 minted
 coin
 in
 the


history
 of
 civilization.
 Since
 the
 US


started
 churning
 them
 out
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 1700s,
 it
 has
 made
 several
 hundred


billion
 of
 them.
 That
 little
 portrait
 of


Abraham
 Lincoln
 on
 the
 back,
 which


obviously
 came
 later,
 is
 the
 most


reproduced
 piece
 of
 art
 on
 Earth.
 As


I've
 said
 before,
 though,
 the
 penny's


time
 has
 come.
 The
 government
 is


stopping
 production,
 citing
 the
 fact


that
 pennies
 are
 used
 less
 and
 less
 and


that
 each
 one
 actually
 costs
 three
 cents


to
 make.
 As
 of
 this
 fall,
 several


Federal
 Reserve
 sites,
 which
 distribute


coins
 to
 banks,
 have
 stopped
 fulfilling


orders
 for
 pennies.
 That
 has
 left
 stores


that
 still
 do
 a
 fair
 amount
 of
 cash


transactions
 in
 a
 tricky
 spot.
 How
 do


you
 make
 change
 when
 you
 have
 no


pennies?
 A
 consortium
 of
 convenience


stores
 and
 grocery
 stores
 across
 the


country
 is
 now
 actually
 urging
 Congress


to
 pass
 a
 national
 law
 rounding


transactions
 to
 the
 nearest
 nickel.
 The


Midwest
 chain
 QuickTrip
 already
 rolled


out
 its
 version
 of
 that
 plan.
 It's


rounding
 all
 cash
 transactions
 down
 at


its
 nearly
 1,000
 stores.
 I
 will
 just
 say


here
 though
 that
 when
 you
 do
 the
 math,


there
 really
 should
 not
 be
 a
 penny


shortage
 just
 yet.
 There
 are
 so
 so
 so


many
 pennies
 still
 out
 there
 that
 even


by
 a
 conservative
 estimate
 there's
 $724


cents
 worth
 of
 pennies
 per
 person
 in
 the


US.
 So
 they're
 out
 there
 just
 don't


really
 know
 where
 all
 of
 them
 are.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines
 today
 on
 the


daily.


>> New
 Yorkers
 know
 exactly
 what
 it
 is
 that


I'm
 running
 on.
 I'll
 have
 people
 stop
 me


in
 the
 street
 and
 just
 shout
 fast
 and


free
 buses
 or
 universal
 childare
 or


freeze
 the
 rent.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 that
 means
 that
 we're
 building
 a


movement
 not
 around
 an
 individual
 but


rather
 around
 these
 policy
 commitments


and
 that
 is
 what
 we
 will
 be
 held
 to


account
 for
 and
 that
 is
 something
 that
 I


want.

 interview
 with
 Zeron
 Mdani,
 the


Democratic
 socialist
 who's
 running
 for


mayor
 of
 New
 York
 City.

 Times
