[Music]


hi
 everybody
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 and
 today


I'm
 in
 good
 company
 with
 Tuan
 the
 CEO
 of


Worlds
 voice
 and
 in
 the
 fun
 we
 own
 2.3%


of
 the
 company
 totaling
 more
 than
 $1


billion
 so
 big
 welcome
 to
 fun
 now
 um


when
 you
 took
 the
 job
 Ed
 wals
 uh
 you


called
 it
 a
 burning
 platform
 why
 were


you
 so
 dramatic
 in
 kind
 of
 your
 opening


statement
 so
 first
 of
 all
 it
 was
 an


internal
 meeting
 uh
 I
 would
 say
 so
 this


is
 my
 third
 transformation
 right
 we
 may


talk
 about
 what
 are
 the
 right
 pillars
 I


learned
 what
 pillars
 you
 want
 to
 have
 in


place
 sort
 of
 in
 Transformations
 one
 of


the
 pillars
 is
 very
 important
 that


actually
 you
 put
 the
 mirror
 up
 because


most
 of
 the


organizations
 which
 requires


turnaround
 they


don't
 nature
 of
 it
 whole
 employee
 base


is
 not
 anymore


communicated
 where
 the
 company
 is
 I


think
 that
 town
 hle
 what
 I
 did
 when
 I


first
 came
 in
 obviously
 I
 did
 lots
 of


assessment
 of
 the
 business
 before
 I


shoved
 up
 then
 I
 got
 together
 with


leadership
 because
 I
 want
 to
 get
 them
 on


board
 then
 we
 had
 the
 big


tunel
 to
 engage
 everybody
 else
 right
 it


in
 that
 tunnel
 it
 was
 1
 and
 a
 half
 hours


what
 I
 was


doing
 early
 on
 put
 the
 mirror


up
 and
 then
 talk
 about
 the
 vision
 and


how
 we
 are
 going
 to
 get
 there
 how
 did


people
 react
 actually
 internally
 people


reacted
 it
 was
 they
 found
 it
 very


energizing
 of
 course
 externally
 you


found
 the
 first
 15
 minutes
 of
 that
 on


the
 on
 the
 news
 which
 was
 saying
 burning


platform
 normally
 when
 I
 walk
 to
 the


sort
 of
 work
 I
 I
 put
 my
 headphone
 and
 I


listen
 to
 music
 or
 podcast
 something


like
 that
 I
 was
 actually
 like
 that
 in


King's
 cross
 station
 I
 was
 sort
 of


walking
 with
 my
 headphone
 on
 a
 lady


approached
 me
 and
 said
 are
 you
 too
 fun


next
 day
 this


is
 I
 I
 said
 I
 took
 the
 headphone
 of
 I


said
 yes
 she
 said
 that
 town
 hle
 was
 so


energized
 when
 I
 read
 it
 I
 thought
 you


know
 what
 he
 he's
 either
 going
 to
 turn


it
 around
 or
 he's
 going
 to
 be
 out
 of


there
 in
 a
 year
 but
 you
 still
 here
 so


that's
 all
 good
 how
 did
 you
 prepare
 for


the
 job
 you
 say
 you
 made
 assessments


before
 how
 how
 does
 one
 do
 that
 before


one
 takes
 job
 so
 I
 do
 external


assessment
 and
 internal
 assessment
 so


early
 September
 I
 actually
 launch
 an


external
 benchmarking
 which
 took
 couple


of
 months
 uh
 division
 by
 division
 and
 I


created
 the
 steering
 committee
 I
 wasn't


in
 the
 job
 I
 invited
 all
 the
 division


leaders
 to
 be
 in
 the
 steering
 committee


because
 if
 they
 have


disagreements
 while
 we
 are
 progressing


the
 external
 benchmarking
 they
 should
 be


in
 the
 mix
 right
 so
 obviously
 CFO
 as


well
 so
 that
 was
 the
 steering
 committee


so
 between
 early
 September
 to


November
 we
 did
 external
 benchmarking


while
 this
 was
 happening
 I
 was
 meeting


with
 the
 teams
 M
 to
 do
 my
 internal


assessment
 how
 many
 meetings
 did
 you


have
 many
 frankly
 many
 uh
 so
 I
 I
 cannot


I
 don't
 count
 why
 is
 it
 important
 to


meet
 so
 many
 people
 before
 you
 start
 one


of
 the
 things
 I
 actually
 did
 Beyond


internal
 assessment
 I
 talked
 to
 top


investors
 so
 I
 actually
 met
 with
 them


and
 it
 was
 very
 clear
 that
 there
 was


huge
 frustration
 out
 there
 so
 it
 was


very
 clear
 to
 me
 we
 needed
 to
 go
 into


action
 this
 wasn't
 going
 to
 be
 a


honeymoon
 period
 so
 therefore
 there
 is


an
 ideal
 sequence
 of
 my
 pillars
 but
 I


hardly
 end
 up
 with
 the
 ideal
 sequence
 in


Transformations
 because
 in
 this
 case
 I


need
 to
 get
 go
 into
 action
 very
 quickly


so
 circumstance
 always
 sort
 of
 you
 need


to
 tailor
 it
 so
 then
 you
 come
 in
 here


gen
 one
 what
 you
 do
 gem
 one
 when
 I
 came


here
 I
 came
 with
 very
 clear
 ideas
 then


uh
 because
 we
 all
 as
 an
 ET
 I


already
 met
 and
 we
 agreed
 actually
 late


November
 as
 an
 executive
 leadership
 we


did
 until
 late
 November
 remember
 they


were
 part
 of
 the
 steering
 committee
 Etc


we
 did
 lots
 of
 work
 so
 we
 knew
 what
 the


agenda
 was
 okay
 we
 came


in
 ET
 was
 obviously
 ET
 change


executive
 team
 change
 quite
 a
 bit
 but
 at


that
 time
 you
 had
 set
 the
 team
 before


you
 came
 no
 actually
 that
 was
 the
 old


team
 mostly
 old
 team
 right
 I
 brought
 one


or
 two
 new
 people
 by
 that
 time
 two


people
 actually
 but


mostly
 uh
 the
 previous
 team
 uh
 but
 we


were
 aligned
 then
 we
 actually
 top
 100


meeting
 we
 had
 we
 got
 aligned
 with
 that


then
 went
 to
 the
 whole
 organization
 and


that
 was
 the
 kickoff
 of
 transformation


program
 m
 but
 we
 knew
 how
 we
 were
 going


to
 structure
 the
 transformation
 program


Etc
 you
 had
 some
 priorities
 which
 you


set
 pretty
 early
 one
 was
 to
 refine
 the


contracts
 and
 work
 on
 pricing
 how
 do
 you


do
 that
 we've
 done
 lots
 of
 things


everybody
 sort
 of
 focuses
 on
 contract


negotiations
 because
 I
 it
 is
 interesting


for
 many
 people
 frankly
 we
 came
 up
 with


six
 lever
 as
 part
 of
 that
 the
 investment


we
 make
 and
 the
 risks
 we
 take
 we
 don't


Ren
 numerate
 them
 sufficiently
 in
 our


pricing
 second
 thing
 is
 what
 is
 called


ltsa
 contracts
 this
 long-term
 contracts


with
 Airlines
 and
 so
 on
 our
 pricing


therefore
 was
 not
 good
 there
 and
 we
 had


lots
 of
 big
 contracts
 with
 losses
 if
 you


like
 so
 early
 on
 we
 needed
 to
 deal
 with


it
 for
 two
 reasons
 for
 for
 performance


Improvement
 reason
 because
 I
 actually


again
 we
 are
 not
 talking
 about
 the


pillars


but
 normally
 I
 lead
 with
 strategy
 then


everything
 comes
 but
 I
 was
 very
 clear


that
 strategy
 was
 going
 to
 take
 six
 to


nine
 months
 because
 the
 way
 I
 run


strategy
 is
 very
 inclusive
 I
 don't
 run


it
 with
 couple
 of
 people
 in
 a
 dark
 room


and
 how
 did
 we
 go
 about
 it
 your
 question


Nikolai
 I
 really
 believe
 we
 are
 not
 a


supplier
 we
 are
 a
 partner
 and
 that's
 how


I
 step
 into
 these
 conversations
 and
 most


of
 them
 had
 operational
 issues
 with
 Roy


Roy
 so
 these
 are
 with
 the
 engines
 that


you
 supply
 to
 the
 Airlines
 and
 just
 uh


for
 the
 listener
 here
 you
 supply
 half


the
 engines
 to
 the
 world's
 wide
 body


planes
 that
 that's
 correct
 that's
 corre


incredible
 Market
 position
 yes
 I
 think


our
 delivery
 is
 50%
 yes
 there
 are
 only


two
 players
 as
 you
 know
 in
 that
 market


so
 what
 do
 you
 do
 I
 mean
 every
 meeting


is
 slightly
 different
 in
 some
 sense
 very


identical
 in
 the
 other
 sense
 because


they
 all
 had
 operational
 issues
 and
 I


said
 at
 the
 end
 I
 acknowledge
 it
 I'm


going
 to
 make
 sure
 I'm
 on
 it
 and
 we
 can


talk
 about
 it
 but
 I
 also
 said
 weak


royroy
 can
 only
 give
 you
 that
 I'm


investing
 1
 billion
 pounds
 in
 time
 on


Wing
 program
 that's
 improving
 products


our
 customers
 will
 benefit
 a
 lot
 right


we
 are
 going
 to
 improve
 whole
 portfolio


by


40%
 that
 means
 a
 lot
 less


disruption
 for
 our
 customers
 I
 said
 weak


rollsroyce
 could
 do
 only
 this
 stronger


rollsroyce
 can
 be
 a
 better
 part
 partn


but
 you
 are
 not
 negotiating
 with
 uh


companies
 which
 print
 money
 right
 you


are
 negotiating
 with
 Airlines
 which
 are


generally
 not
 doing
 well
 so
 why
 would


they
 want
 to
 give
 away
 a
 lot
 more
 money


to
 you
 I've
 been
 actually
 on
 both
 sides


of
 the
 equation
 in
 my
 career
 sustainable


Partnerships
 only
 work
 and
 only
 become


sustainable
 if
 they
 are
 mutually


beneficial
 otherwise
 they
 are
 not
 I
 was


in
 a
 very
 rich
 contract
 so
 one
 day
 after


3
 years
 four
 years
 I
 don't
 remember
 ex


they
 came
 and
 said
 sorry
 enough
 is


enough
 if
 you
 want
 us
 if
 you
 want
 to


take
 us
 to
 the
 court
 take
 us
 to
 the


court
 we
 are
 not
 honoring
 this
 contract


anymore
 I
 didn't
 do
 that
 by
 the
 way


so
 my
 whole
 point
 was
 actually
 let's


rebalance
 this
 and
 we
 did
 some
 early


work
 and
 we
 can
 also
 find
 win-win


Solutions
 I
 didn't
 actually
 fight
 the


issue
 I
 said
 we
 need
 to
 rebalance
 it
 but


we
 can
 if
 we
 bring
 the
 teams
 together


find
 win-win
 Solutions
 so
 now
 that
 we


made
 great
 progress
 I
 look
 back
 in
 every


case
 we
 found
 win-win
 Solutions
 and
 now


you
 approve
 all
 pricing
 or
 you
 look
 at


all
 contracts
 is
 that
 right
 that's


correct
 you
 said
 that
 uh
 it
 was


impossible
 to
 change
 things
 that
 people


didn't
 think
 was
 possible
 to
 change
 what


are
 some
 of
 the
 other
 things
 that
 you


have
 changed
 I
 mean
 in
 this
 company
 we


change
 everything
 effectively
 and
 we


renegotiated
 OE
 contracts
 as
 well
 the


big
 change
 in
 this
 and
 it
 it
 plays
 a


significant
 role
 in
 in
 my
 pillars
 having


a
 very
 gr
 strategy
 which
 Roy
 Ro
 didn't


have
 so
 it's
 detailed
 in
 terms
 of
 what


you
 want
 to
 achieve
 it
 is
 detailed
 in


terms
 of
 participation
 and
 competitive


strategy
 I
 where
 you
 are
 going
 to


participate
 and
 you
 make
 lots
 of
 choices


and
 how
 we
 are
 going
 to
 compete
 that
 is


so


important
 because
 it
 becomes
 alignment


tool
 because
 it
 aligns
 the
 whole


organization
 I'm
 a
 huge
 believer
 in
 what


you
 are
 saying
 here
 and
 we're
 doing
 the


same
 in
 the
 fund
 right
 these
 kind
 of


broad
 anchoring
 means
 that
 when
 you
 have


decided
 something
 it's
 easier
 to
 move


but
 this
 is
 uh
 quite
 Scandinavian
 but


way
 of
 doing
 it
 right
 where
 did
 you
 take


it
 from
 I


learned
 by
 doing
 I'm
 not
 Scandinavian
 so


I
 didn't
 get
 it
 from
 there
 but
 my
 view
 I


use
 it


alignment


engagement
 and
 Performance
 Management


too
 so
 I
 learned
 it
 it
 is
 one
 of
 the
 key


pillars
 in
 my


Transformations
 how
 are
 you
 doing
 it
 I


do
 four
 things


right
 I
 obviously
 tailor
 it
 but
 four


things
 one
 is
 put
 the
 mirror
 up
 with
 a


Clear
 Vision
 people
 are
 very
 important


leadership
 is
 even
 more
 important
 I
 have


fundamental
 belief
 good
 people
 make


difference
 and
 Leadership
 has
 a
 big
 role


in
 transformation


because
 they
 need
 to
 deliver
 the
 goods


at
 the
 same
 time
 lead
 to


change
 rather
 than
 only
 delivery
 I


create
 the
 right
 leadership
 so
 that


meant
 we
 made
 lots
 of
 changes
 on
 the


executive
 team
 and
 then
 top
 100
 we
 call


it
 coo
 minus
 2
 we
 change


50%
 either
 new
 people
 or
 they
 change


their
 positions
 who
 do
 you
 promote
 what


what's
 the
 leadership
 skills
 you
 are


looking
 for
 I
 look
 at
 obviously
 they


need
 to
 be
 capable
 in
 leading
 the


business
 I
 don't
 look
 at
 is
 see
 sort
 of


loyal
 Etc
 I
 don't
 look
 at
 that
 I


actually
 look
 at
 individual


characteristics
 and
 that's
 then
 my
 job


to
 create
 a
 team
 out
 of
 it
 m
 i
 put


together
 a
 sheet
 what
 I
 expect
 from
 them


I
 gave
 everybody
 first
 week
 even
 people


need
 to
 believe


in
 extraordinary
 in
 my
 previous
 life
 I


was
 an
 analyst
 on
 cover
 rollsroyce
 and
 I


met
 uh
 the
 person
 who
 ran
 it
 then
 war
 in


East
 he
 talked
 about
 uh
 permafrost
 as


being
 the
 midlevel
 of
 the
 company
 really


really
 really
 difficult
 to
 change
 why


are
 you
 managing
 to
 change
 it
 it's
 a


mindset
 thing
 right
 it
 is
 more
 than


mindset
 because
 I
 totally
 disagree
 if


somebody
 is
 saying
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 team


exercises
 cultural
 change
 exercises
 and


culture
 will
 change
 that's
 not
 my
 model


you
 need
 need
 to
 put
 the
 right
 things
 in


place
 so
 granular


strategy
 most
 of
 the
 organizations
 don't


when
 they
 have
 it
 they
 put
 it
 on
 the


Shelf
 when
 I
 am
 building
 granular


strategy
 I
 am
 already
 thinking
 about


strategic
 strategy
 implementation
 we


have
 17
 strategic
 initiatives
 which
 will


transform
 this
 company
 17
 you


performance
 manage
 that
 it
 is
 embedded


in
 the
 organization


because
 of
 if
 you
 only
 want
 to
 run


things
 with


communication
 that's
 where
 the
 things


stumble
 but
 if
 you
 actually
 get
 I
 call


it
 Swit
 spot
 aligned
 organization


everybody
 knows
 their
 roles
 my
 17


program
 because
 strategy
 is
 that


granular
 implementation
 is
 granular


think
 about
 I
 said
 alignment
 engagement


Performance
 Management
 tool
 let
 me
 time


on
 win
 Improvement
 is
 one
 of
 them
 so


let's
 say
 Nic
 you
 are
 the
 time
 on
 wi


leader
 just
 explain
 time
 on
 wing
 it
 is


effectively
 improving
 our
 products
 so


that
 durability
 of
 the
 products
 we
 have


reliability
 of
 our
 engines
 are
 very
 good


we
 are
 making
 this1
 billion
 Improvement


and
 ponds
 actually
 that's
 one
 program


one
 of
 the
 17
 I'm
 just
 giving
 you


example
 right


so
 now
 you
 are
 the
 leader
 of
 it
 here
 is


my
 program
 now
 I
 told
 you
 the
 following


you
 matter
 Nicola
 in
 our
 transformation


you
 and
 your
 team
 matter
 it
 is
 very


engaging
 those
 people
 tend
 to
 be
 mid


managers
 because
 mid
 live
 I
 gave
 you


something
 you
 matter
 and
 go
 and
 engage


this
 with
 your
 team
 when
 you
 go
 to
 your


team
 you
 are
 saying
 guys
 here's
 what
 we


can
 actually
 contribute
 in
 this


transformation
 that
 is
 so
 satisfying
 in


big


organizations
 if
 I
 am
 doing
 something
 in


line
 with
 the
 culture
 I
 let
 it
 go


because
 culture
 will
 take
 care
 of
 it
 if


I
 am
 doing
 something
 against
 the
 culture


and
 I
 want
 to
 change
 the
 culture
 i


performance
 manage
 very


consistently
 then
 over
 time
 that
 changes


the
 culture
 what
 part
 of
 the
 culture
 did


you
 need
 to
 change


what
 of
 the
 most
 important
 cultural


change
 I
 made
 CEO
 judgment
 based
 on
 year


on-year
 Improvement
 on
 that
 because
 I


want
 people
 to
 think
 strategic
 progress


and
 our
 accelerated
 delivery
 has
 a
 lot


to
 do
 with
 this
 we
 can
 talk
 about
 it


Nikolai
 but
 strategic
 progress
 is
 one


then
 we
 came
 up
 with
 four
 behaviors
 that


we
 are
 actually
 rolling
 out
 as
 we
 speak


right
 let
 me
 tell
 safety
 first
 we
 can


talk
 about
 it
 uh
 doing
 the
 right
 things


yeah
 and
 then
 making
 a
 difference
 I'm


going
 to
 remember
 I
 keep
 it
 simple
 what


we
 see
 often
 in
 companies
 and
 you
 you


probably
 saw
 that
 in
 BP
 too
 right
 when


you
 work
 in
 a
 company
 where
 parts
 of
 the


organization
 needs
 to
 be
 so
 super
 safe


it
 spills
 into
 the
 rest
 of
 the


organization
 so
 even
 places
 where
 you


don't
 have
 to
 have
 to
 be
 super
 safe
 you


build
 super
 safe
 procedures
 obviously
 I


manage
 business
 businesses
 with
 very


highrisk
 profile
 yeah
 goes
 without


saying
 that
 these
 engines
 need
 to
 take


over
 and
 not
 stop
 me
 there
 right
 so
 it's


it's
 imperative
 for
 everything
 you
 do


absolutely
 when
 you
 have
 been


implementing
 this
 how
 is
 it
 to
 work
 with


the
 labor
 force
 and
 the
 unions
 and
 so
 on


I
 I
 talked
 to
 you
 about
 500
 people
 were


already
 included
 in
 strategy
 development


therefore
 I
 never
 had
 an
 issue
 oh
 I
 have


a
 strategy
 now
 I
 need
 to
 engage
 the
 or


organization
 we
 were
 already


aligned
 not
 to
 mention
 that
 500
 people's


brains
 and


experience
 actually
 improve
 the
 strategy


sort
 of
 quality
 of
 strategy
 but
 actually


you
 are
 already
 aligned
 everybody
 knows


oh
 we
 made
 lots
 of
 tough
 decisions
 so
 an


Union
 engagement
 so
 that
 whatever
 we
 do


here
 is
 pretty
 inclusive
 already
 rather


than
 sort
 of
 let's
 do
 the
 things
 in
 dark


room
 and
 and
 then
 let's
 go
 and
 engage


people
 no
 not
 like
 that
 it's
 incredible


how
 fast
 uh
 this
 has
 gone
 right
 you're


now
 one
 year
 and
 nine
 months
 into
 into


your
 period
 here
 um
 how
 far
 are
 you
 on


on
 the
 transformation
 you
 think
 from
 the


sort
 of
 results
 you
 are
 absolutely
 right


accelerate
 delivery
 I
 think
 we
 frontend


loaded
 the
 delivery
 one
 day
 this
 year
 I


was
 reflecting
 on
 it


because
 results
 delivery
 how
 much
 of
 it


how
 much
 of
 the
 performance
 Improvement


we
 thought
 we
 were
 going
 to


deliver
 was


identical
 to
 two
 other
 Transformations
 I


did
 that
 made
 me
 sort
 of
 think
 hold
 on
 a


minute
 very
 different
 businesses
 very


different
 starting
 points
 different


people
 etc
 etc
 how
 come
 here's
 my


conclusion
 after
 that
 reflection
 you


change
 the
 mindset
 to
 strategic
 progress


you
 have
 very
 clear
 programs
 I
 talk


about
 it
 owned
 by
 the
 people
 and
 then


you
 go
 with
 pace
 and
 intensity
 who
 did


you
 learn
 it
 from
 did
 you
 learn
 it
 at
 BP


my
 learning


process
 sort


of
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 sort
 of
 different


because
 I'm
 still
 learning
 by
 way
 before


I
 joined
 Mobile
 in
 the
 US
 after
 the


school
 I
 was
 actually
 when
 I
 was
 doing


PhD
 I
 was
 teaching
 in
 Ohio
 State


University
 and
 doing
 research
 on
 uh
 micr


and
 macroeconomics
 so
 I
 I
 had
 this


learning
 part
 of
 me
 and
 when
 I
 through


out
 my
 career
 I
 always
 whatever
 position


I
 took
 to
 cut
 it
 short
 I
 read
 at
 least


three
 books
 about
 it
 and
 then
 you
 you


synthesize
 it
 those
 are
 textbooks


obviously
 you
 synthesize
 it
 you


implement
 it
 you
 learn
 more
 who
 are
 the


best
 leaders
 you
 have
 learned
 from
 I


don't
 think
 there
 was
 one
 leader
 that
 I


can
 actually
 say
 but
 a
 little
 bit
 of


sort
 of
 me
 completing
 the
 puzzle
 for


myself
 if
 you
 like
 rather
 other
 than


copying
 one
 person
 I
 say
 what
 I
 think
 uh


and
 and
 that
 authentic
 bit
 is
 not
 about


copying
 it
 is
 me
 creating
 but
 learning


from
 every
 occasion
 frankly
 I'm
 still


learning
 I
 actually
 tell
 the
 team
 I


learn
 a
 lot
 I
 mean
 authenticity
 I
 think


is
 key
 if
 you
 we
 see
 the
 people
 who
 burn


out
 are
 the
 people
 who
 are
 not
 authentic


the
 people
 who
 try
 to
 be
 somebody
 else


very
 very
 important
 how
 important
 is
 the


board
 in
 this
 process
 oh
 very
 important


coming
 in
 and
 making
 an
 impact
 on
 a


company
 like
 this
 is
 very
 special
 that's


why
 I'm
 here
 ah
 in
 that
 board
 is
 a
 big


role
 because


turnarounds
 don't
 happen
 by
 incremental


actions
 when
 you


are
 making
 non-incremental


actions
 not
 everybody's
 happy
 internally


or
 externally
 by
 the
 way
 you
 talk
 about


burning
 platform
 Etc
 board
 should
 be


prepared
 to
 support
 you
 in
 the


turnaround
 because
 you
 are
 going
 to
 be


doing
 some
 of
 the
 things
 which
 will


bring
 big


change
 and
 that
 mean
 not
 everybody
 will


like
 it
 at
 the
 beginning
 I
 actually


believe
 this
 is
 a
 transformation
 which


will
 benefit
 all
 the
 stakeholders


but
 it's
 not
 about
 me
 how
 it
 lands
 with


them
 early
 on
 may
 be
 very
 different
 is


it
 lonely
 to
 be
 the
 CEO
 yeah
 but
 I
 mean


it
 is
 part
 of
 the
 job
 right
 I
 mean


that's
 how
 I
 see
 it
 do
 you
 think
 uh


being
 the
 COO
 is
 tougher
 now
 than
 it
 was


5
 years
 ago
 generally
 across
 companies


yeah
 probably
 because
 why
 what
 what
 what


is
 making
 it
 tougher
 to
 be
 the
 COO
 these


days
 all
 the


stakeholders
 understanding
 frankly
 and


their
 awareness
 improved
 over
 years
 so


you
 need
 not
 only
 about
 sort
 of


employees
 and
 investors
 when
 you
 are


running
 a
 company
 you
 need
 to
 think


about
 all
 the
 stakeholders
 and
 not
 in


this
 sense
 of
 like
 zeros
 you
 need
 to


embrace
 it
 in
 a
 way
 therefore
 I
 said
 it


early
 on
 transformation
 is
 holistic
 this


is
 not
 restructuring
 by
 the
 way
 M
 this


is
 transformation
 I
 Define
 both
 of
 them


very
 differently
 and
 it
 will
 benefit
 all


the
 stakeholders
 world
 is
 actually


rapidly
 changing
 I'm
 not
 sure
 it
 was


that
 rapidly
 changing
 in
 the
 past
 if
 I


say
 two
 big
 trends
 I
 see
 in
 the
 world


energy
 transition
 and
 digital


transformation
 neither
 of
 them
 were
 at


the
 level
 that
 they
 are
 right
 now
 10


years
 ago
 but
 the
 speed
 of
 change
 is


different
 and
 the
 impact
 not
 only
 impact


on
 your
 business
 but
 how
 much


opportunity
 they
 create
 also
 how
 you
 are


going
 to
 is
 one
 and
 stakeholders


awareness
 improved
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 so


uh
 the
 energy
 transition
 and
 the


digitalization
 how
 does
 that
 impact
 your


uh
 largest
 division
 the
 Civil
 Aerospace


next
 20
 years
 on
 energy
 transition
 in


commercial
 planes
 I
 should


say
 will
 be
 about
 really
 more


efficiency
 I
 fuel


efficiency
 and
 100%
 saf
 compatible


that's
 sustainable
 aviation
 fuel
 right


that's
 sustainable
 aviation
 fuel
 we
 are


the
 only
 company
 actually
 can
 say
 all
 of


our
 engines


compatible
 with
 100%
 sustainable


Aviation
 field
 you
 can
 I
 know


regulations
 don't
 do
 that
 don't
 require


it
 right
 now
 but
 they
 are
 ready
 world


needs
 to


incentivize
 saaf
 especially
 what
 I
 call


synthetic
 fuels
 why
 because
 today
 saf


most
 of
 the
 people
 are
 talking
 about
 is


biobased
 but
 there
 isn't
 enough
 of
 it
 to


decarbonize
 the
 whole
 aviation
 industry


therefore
 we
 need
 to
 incentivize


synthetic
 fuel


I
 from
 Green
 hydrogen
 you
 go
 to
 with
 a


conversion
 technology
 you
 go
 to


effectively
 saf
 how
 fast
 is
 this


transition
 going
 not
 very
 fast
 right
 now


because
 it
 needs
 to
 be
 incentivized
 I


mean
 reality
 is
 these
 Technologies
 by


definition
 especially
 early
 on
 more


expensive
 even
 biofuels
 is
 more


expensive
 as
 you
 know
 many
 airlines


therefore
 unless
 it
 is
 mandated
 it
 they


don't
 use
 it
 because
 it
 creates


competitive
 disadvantage
 for
 them
 right


and
 synthetic
 fuels
 is
 even
 a
 little
 bit


more
 expensive
 uh
 but
 the
 benefit
 of
 it


you
 can
 scale
 up
 so
 I'm
 not
 sure
 without


policy
 support
 they
 will
 actually
 scale


up
 significantly
 hence
 my
 point
 about


policy
 support
 talking
 about
 another


change
 here
 what
 what
 are
 your
 plans
 for


the
 narrow
 body
 Market
 first
 of
 all
 that


market
 is
 an
 interesting
 Market


obviously
 huge
 right
 it
 is
 Big
 growing


white
 body
 is
 also
 growing
 but
 here
 are


two
 things
 in
 strategy
 presentation
 last


year
 in
 we
 called
 it
 CMD
 effectively
 I


call
 talk
 about
 we
 want
 to
 participate


with
 with
 a
 partnership
 why
 do
 we


believe
 what
 are
 we
 bringing
 to
 the


table
 so
 thing
 about
 first
 of
 of
 all


Next
 Generation
 uh
 engine
 will
 be
 more


fuel
 efficient
 and
 saf
 compatible
 as
 I


said
 ultrafan
 is
 exactly
 that
 which
 is


your
 technology
 this
 is
 our
 technology


that
 we
 are
 working
 on
 uh
 it


is
 it
 is
 10%
 more
 efficient
 than
 the


most
 efficient
 engine
 is
 out
 there
 and


we
 believe
 with
 that
 and
 what
 you
 can
 do


in
 the
 whole
 air
 aircraft
 new
 aircraft


you
 can
 take
 that
 10%
 to


15%
 which
 is
 significant
 and
 it
 is
 100%


saf
 compatible
 so
 that's
 one
 thing


second
 thing
 is
 are
 IPS
 on
 it
 this
 is
 a


geared
 structure
 and
 one
 thing
 Nikolai
 I


don't
 think
 there's
 any
 controversy


around
 that
 in
 the
 industry
 next


generation
 will
 be
 geared
 dine
 because


of
 this
 efficiency
 requirement
 if
 you


like
 and
 our
 IPS
 and
 how
 long
 they


are
 are
 position
 us
 positions
 us
 really


well
 and
 then
 the
 third
 thing
 is
 we


really
 have
 some
 capability
 in
 this


space
 that
 respected
 by
 others
 so
 those


three


things
 we
 I
 believe
 we
 bring
 us
 to
 the


table
 talking
 about
 the
 table
 so
 we
 are


now
 seeing
 boing
 struggling
 with
 quality


we
 are
 seeing
 Airbus
 uh
 kind
 of


struggling
 with
 producing
 enough
 volumes


when
 will
 we
 have
 a
 third
 credible


player
 here
 it
 may
 take
 a
 while
 uh
 but


and
 who
 is
 it
 going
 to
 be
 you
 think
 I


mean
 comak
 is
 working
 on
 it
 as
 you
 know


that's
 a
 Chinese
 company
 yes
 Chinese


company
 uh
 when
 do
 you
 think
 they'll


have
 a
 good
 plane
 I
 mean
 they
 already


have
 narrow
 body
 as
 you
 know
 they
 have
 a


plane
 and
 narrow
 body
 uh
 today
 with
 G


engine
 so
 that
 is
 already
 out
 there
 and


they
 are
 scaling
 up
 so
 in
 a
 way
 they
 are


already
 in
 the
 market
 uh
 in
 that
 sense


you
 are
 one
 of
 the
 leading
 companies
 in


small
 modular
 reactors
 yes
 which
 is
 kind


of
 a
 new
 way
 to
 harvest
 the
 nuclear
 yeah


Power
 what
 what
 do
 you
 think
 this
 could


be
 if
 world
 is


genuinely
 sincere
 about
 net
 Z


especially
 Europe
 because
 us
 has
 few


other
 options
 M
 doesn't
 work
 without


nuclear
 that's
 simple
 this
 is
 not
 about


my
 opinion
 versus
 another
 expert
 if
 you


believe
 in
 mathematics
 you
 have
 to


believe
 that
 okay
 so
 therefore
 Europe


needs
 to
 embrace
 nuclear
 then
 you
 have


two
 choices
 big
 or
 small
 big
 or
 small
 oh


we
 know
 all
 all
 the
 advantages
 and


disadvantages
 of
 the
 big
 because
 world


has
 good
 good
 bad
 and
 ugly
 experience


with
 that
 what
 is
 the
 advantage
 here


first
 of
 all
 this
 cost
 and
 derion
 risk


it
 is
 small
 you
 dilute
 but
 it's
 not
 all


this
 is
 85%
 of
 it
 manufacturing
 process


so
 it
 is
 not
 a
 big
 EPC
 project
 big


nuclear
 plants
 every
 time
 you
 start
 from


zero
 how
 you
 want
 to
 mass
 produce
 them


85%
 marginally
 you
 produce
 and
 you
 learn


like
 many
 manufacturing
 learning
 process


so
 why
 is
 it
 so
 uh
 financially
 risky
 why


are
 people
 so
 uncertain
 about
 the
 cost


of
 making
 these
 I
 mean
 it
 financially


they
 are
 much
 less
 risky
 than
 the
 big


plant
 but
 new


technology
 it's
 not
 new
 technology
 in


this
 s
 that
 we
 have
 been
 doing
 this


technology
 60
 years
 in
 UK


submarines
 but
 commercializing
 new


technology
 early
 early
 plans
 are
 always


risky
 so
 when
 will
 you
 have
 your
 first


PL
 up
 and
 running
 you
 think
 you
 when
 we


have
 the
 hopefully
 orders
 from
 uh
 gbn


and
 few
 other
 countries
 we
 are
 working


with
 uh
 I
 am
 hoping
 next
 year
 if
 orders


come
 then
 frankly
 you
 need
 to
 build
 the


supply
 chain
 Etc
 then
 2030
 2031
 around


that
 where
 are
 you
 technology
 wise


compared
 to
 let's
 say
 the
 The
 Venture


which
 is
 backed
 by
 Bill
 Gates
 so
 I
 think


ours
 is
 most
 Advance
 especially
 in


Europe
 This
 is
 not
 me
 talking
 there
 is
 a


regulatory
 process
 which


says
 three-phase
 process
 right
 which


actually
 assesses
 your
 technology
 and


then
 you
 get
 the
 sort
 of
 approval
 I.E


you
 have
 viable
 technology
 and
 safe
 to


deploy
 we
 are
 the
 only
 company
 actually


a
 effectively
 in
 phase
 two
 so
 in
 in
 your


mind
 is
 this
 like
 a


no-brainer
 type
 of
 technology
 to
 take
 in


use
 for
 Supply
 security
 and
 Net
 Zero
 for


Europe


yes
 especially
 for
 Europe
 right
 right


right
 because
 Europe
 doesn't
 have
 many


choices
 defense
 we
 are
 not
 going
 to
 talk


about
 geopolitics
 but
 how
 is
 the
 world


CH
 changing
 the
 way
 you
 run
 your
 defense


business
 we
 are
 not
 in
 weapons


production
 so
 people
 have


misunderstanding
 that
 they
 now
 our


performance
 is
 good
 people
 think
 ah
 it


is
 Ukraine
 more
 and
 so
 on
 it
 has
 nothing


to
 do
 Ur
 engines
 Ukraine
 more
 didn't


impact
 at
 all
 our
 defense
 business
 right


we
 so
 therefore
 there
 is
 a


misunderstanding
 our
 defense
 business


Improvement
 so
 far
 is
 all
 underlying


performance
 Improvement
 if
 you
 look
 at


what
 we
 call
 midterm
 i
 27
 targets
 it's


going
 to
 be
 mostly
 about
 underlying


performance
 Improvement
 in
 the
 business


after
 that
 we
 have
 big
 programs
 like


B52
 uh
 Flora
 program
 in
 the
 US
 and
 gap


program
 and
 and
 obviously
 submarine


iocus
 growth
 here
 they
 are
 all
 coming
 we


have
 significant
 growth
 coming
 because


of
 the
 Winds
 we
 had
 so
 far
 but
 it
 has


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 Ukraine
 war
 and
 so
 on


what's
 driving
 you
 it's
 lots
 of
 things
 I


talk
 about
 coming
 here
 and
 creating
 a


legacy
 I
 mean
 lot
 transformation


strategic
 goals
 all
 obviously
 you
 want


to
 achieve
 and
 so
 on
 so
 forth
 what's


your
 driving
 force
 what
 makes
 you
 wake


up
 early
 in
 the
 morning
 what
 makes
 you


work
 late
 at
 night
 I'm
 about
 making
 a


difference
 when
 I
 took
 a
 job
 I
 seen
 that


as
 a
 I
 I
 wasn't
 obviously
 CEO
 to
 start


the
 career
 I
 I
 whatever
 job
 I
 always


told
 the


following
 they
 pick
 me
 I
 need
 to
 make
 a


difference
 that
 nobody
 else
 can
 so
 how


how
 does
 that
 show
 up
 right
 because


otherwise
 they
 could
 have
 put
 somebody


else
 if
 if
 I'm
 as
 good
 as
 the
 next
 guy


how
 much
 do
 you
 work
 actually
 I
 I'm
 not


smarter
 I
 should
 say
 Nikolai
 how
 much
 I


used
 to
 work
 probably
 was
 too
 much
 but
 I


actually
 manag
 it


better
 right
 now
 how
 do
 you
 do
 that
 uh


it's
 prioritization
 I
 dynamically


prioritize
 and
 encourage
 my
 team


dynamically
 prioritized
 how
 do
 you
 relax


I
 go
 to
 gym
 every
 morning
 I
 need
 to
 play


competitive
 tennis
 every
 weekend
 so
 I
 I


do
 that
 uh
 sort
 of
 Saturday
 Sunday
 and


sometimes
 nights
 sort
 of
 but
 not
 every


time
 what
 do
 you
 read
 uh
 I
 read
 history


books
 these
 days
 I
 read
 Ai
 and
 history


books
 because
 I
 I
 want
 to
 improve
 myself


Frank
 and
 what
 part
 of
 History
 are
 you


fascinated
 by
 History
 of
 the
 World
 by


Andra
 Mar
 I
 actually
 like
 his
 style
 I


read
 the
 history
 of
 modern


Britain
 by
 him
 again
 is
 art
 and
 culture


important
 in
 your
 life
 culture
 is


definitely
 very
 important
 uh


I'm
 not
 that
 artsy
 sort
 of
 guy
 but


obviously
 given
 how
 many
 countries
 I


lived
 in
 that
 made
 me
 think
 about


cultures
 because
 when
 you
 live
 my
 first


11
 years
 I
 changed
 eight
 countries
 M
 it


wasn't
 by
 Design
 Nikolai
 it
 happened


talking
 about
 young
 age
 what
 is
 your


advice
 to
 young
 people
 three
 things
 if
 I


can
 say
 one
 thing
 is
 is
 learning


actually
 it
 is
 learning
 to
 improve
 your


own
 value
 if
 it
 makes
 sense
 your
 value


as
 an
 individual
 then
 money
 and
 career


progression
 will
 come
 I
 actually


rejected
 this
 is
 true
 story
 big


promotion
 accepted
 a
 horizontal
 move


because
 my
 view
 was
 actually
 that
 is


going
 to
 make
 me
 more
 effective
 later
 on


so
 one
 thing
 is
 learning
 they
 need
 to


think
 about
 how
 they
 learn
 people
 learn


differently
 whatever
 works
 for
 them
 I'm


not
 saying
 there
 is
 one
 way
 but
 they


should
 focus
 on
 themselves
 and
 making
 a


higher
 value
 individual
 number
 two
 power


of
 belief
 I
 tell


people
 did
 you
 achieve
 anything


difficult
 that
 you
 didn't
 believe
 in
 but


people
 that
 I
 talk
 about
 you
 need
 to


believe
 in
 extraordinary
 I
 believe
 in


extraordinary
 but
 it
 doesn't
 happen


without
 the
 Deep
 belief
 it
 is
 possible


but
 is
 this
 has
 this
 got
 to
 do
 with


optimism
 and
 delusional
 optimism
 I'm
 not


an
 optimist
 by
 the
 way
 right
 it's


character
 I
 would
 go
 to
 what's
 not


working
 rather
 than
 what
 is
 working


first
 okay
 which
 gives
 me
 some


recognition
 challenge


sometimes
 with
 the
 organization
 that
 I


work
 on
 okay
 but
 and
 what's
 the
 third


point
 it
 is
 Passion
 whatever
 they
 are


intending
 to
 do
 they
 should
 go
 in
 with


two
 feet
 in
 sometimes
 people
 hedge


themselves
 um
 this
 is
 high
 risk
 go
 with


your
 passion
 go
 with
 two
 feet
 in
 then


you
 can
 make
 things
 happen
 mhm
 do


uh
 you
 clearly
 have
 gone
 with
 both
 your


feet
 into
 this
 turnaround
 situation
 uh


you're
 still
 standing
 it
 looks
 uh
 really


good
 and
 also
 having
 heard
 how
 you
 uh


prioritize
 we
 are
 really
 pleased
 that


you
 have
 dynamically
 prioritized
 these


podcasts
 big
 thank
 you
 okay
 thank
 you
 ni
