Hello everyone, I am Anthony
Welcome to my channel
Today's video
Let’s continue to explore the crisis of Chinese culture.
And how does science deal with this crisis?
In the last video we talked about
China's political system, ideology, and religious beliefs
There is a distinct evolution and development trajectory
For example
The development of Chinese culture
Like an ecosystem on the verge of collapse
When the system encounters a small-scale crisis
The original negative feedback mechanism
Can also adjust and fix problems
The whole system is still in an open state
However, as more and more problems
The system loses the tools and resources to deal with the problem
The result can only be a positive feedback
Constantly reinforcing existing patterns
Even the old model is failing.
The more you want to elevate it to a sacred level
The height of omnipresence
Finally, the whole system loses its flexibility.
Falling more and more into a state of madness and loss of control
This is a cultural regression.
We say
After a person has experienced a traumatic event
Often retreat into a more dependent,
Fear and irrational states
He will reduce his desire to explore and curiosity about the outside world.
Will be more strengthened
Even deifying their own traditional values
Refuse to reflect
Hiding back to the most familiar state of the womb
He will also show stronger mental cleanliness
and control
Trying to strengthen the purity of the original system
and purity
To eliminate all uncertainty and ambiguity
This pursuit of purity and rejection of others
This does not mean that the system is strong
It is a sign of fragility
He no longer has the confidence to face an open
A complex world
No longer believe that you can have a dialogue with others
Only by constructing a self-consistent
But a closed system
To keep yourself from collapsing
The Neo-Confucianism of Song and Ming clearly reflects this phenomenon.
Today's video
Let's talk about it
Science
How to respond to and face the crisis of Chinese culture
Before the video starts, let me say
If you have anything you want to discuss with me
And consulting topics
You can contact my email to make an appointment
So let's get back to today's topic.
As we discussed in our last video
Although the Qin Dynasty first promoted the Qin system throughout the country
However, to truly run this system stably
But faced with huge difficulties
From Qin and Han to Tang and Song
Chinese Society
Experienced numerous institutional and cultural innovations
The imperial power system of Confucianism on the outside and law on the inside became increasingly solid
for example
The Han Dynasty imperial power in order to avoid the fate of being overthrown by the Qin Dynasty
Mystifying and theologizing Confucianism
With the illusory divine will and heaven's will
To replace the real existence of human will
Thus, the imperial power
Covered with a sacred and tender coat
Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties
It was an era when imperial power was relatively withdrawn.
Emperors often rely on compromise
To maintain relations with the nobles
However
This retreat of the Qin system was temporary.
In this old structure
A new force to restore imperial power began to emerge
That is the control of military power by the Han clan generals.
In the Sui and Tang Dynasties
A series of explicit systems to consolidate and strengthen imperial power
Re-shaping
For example, the three-province system, the imperial examination system, etc.
However
Although the Tang Dynasty
There are so many measures to strengthen the imperial autocracy
But it still hasn't stopped the political decline
Entering the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period
Chinese Society
It has fallen into a complete and comprehensive collapse of rituals and music.
Patricide, fratricide, usurpation of the throne, coups, etc. are extremely frequent
So from the middle of the Tang Dynasty to the Song Dynasty
We can see
Confucian scholars
The anxiety about the current situation is far beyond that of previous generations.
They have proposed a number of targeted measures
for example
Further strengthen the sacredness and nobility of the Confucian Three Bonds and Five Constant Virtues
Strengthening the admiration for imperial autocracy
and more extreme rejection and elimination of heterodox cultures
However
In those times such as the separatist regimes,
Behind the crisis of alien invasion
There is also a deeper spiritual crisis hidden
The scholar-official class itself
A comprehensive shake-up of Confucian ethics and cosmic order
If the Confucian scholars themselves
They all began to doubt their faith
Then any external utilitarian means
It all seems useless.
A famous representative is Bai Juyi
Bai Juyi lived in the middle of the Tang Dynasty
He witnessed the harm that various tyrannies in the Tang Dynasty had on people's livelihood.
From his works
We can easily feel
His strong dissatisfaction with the current situation
and heartbroken
We know
In Confucian ethics
The Way of Heaven is not only the embodiment of the order of the universe
It is the source of moral order.
It rewards good and punishes evil.
The Justice and Divinity of Heaven
Because he is in tune with public opinion
So-called "God sees me, the people see me"
"Heaven listens to the people"
Of course God loves the people.
The monarch must exercise benevolent governance to comply with the will of heaven.
However
Unlike ordinary Confucian people,
Bai Juyi did not simply think
These political malpractices are against the way of heaven.
Rather, they began to doubt the justice of Heaven itself.
For example
In his "Sixteen Poems in the Style of Tao Qian", he said:
God does not love the people
How can one make a living?
God loves the people
Why are you a jackal?
that is
If God does not love the people
Why raise humans?
But if you really love the people
But why did they release so many evil people to harm the world?
then
Bai Juyi further questioned whether "Shinto" was fair
He said that Confucius' life was full of ups and downs.
And a cruel person like Qin Shi Huang
Instead, he could unify the world
Thus, Bai Juyi began to doubt the order of the entire universe.
He: Physics is unpredictable, and so is the way of God.
I look up to the sky, and it is pale and grey.
Bai Juyi Questions Heaven
But God is silent
So he felt a kind of disillusionment with the way of heaven.
This makes Bai Juyi's thoughts profound.
It still exceeds the previous Confucian
Reflection on specific events
A tendency to skepticism
This tendency
This is also reflected in a poem:
Don't be surprised by favor or disgrace, don't worry about happiness or sorrow, don't count favors or grudges,
There is no place for Huangdi and Confucius to ask, so how do we know that they are not just in a dream?
We know
Emotions of joy and sorrow caused by favor or disgrace
It is the most basic emotional coordinate of Confucian scholars.
Confucian ethics emphasizes
Scholars should participate in politics
Serving the King and Governing the Country
To realize your own life value
This is the most important and uncertain part
Whether you can gain the appreciation of the monarch
So favor and disfavor
To the dignity of a human being
Of decisive significance
The resulting anxiety and joy
Confucian scholars
Two basic emotions that you can’t get rid of
Even if you say that you should not be happy with material things
Fan Zhongyan, who did not feel sad for himself
It is not really about transcending the emotions of sadness and joy.
But still standing on the Confucian
On the standpoint of "taking the world as one's own responsibility"
To express your joy
However, Bai Juyi
This also deconstructs the moral basis of "sorrow and joy"
Not only did he no longer feel happy or sad because of favor or disgrace,
Even think that these emotions themselves are false
There is no point in grudges
Hard work is worthless
Then, Bai Juyi expressed his doubts about the saint
It is "Huangdi and Confucius have no questions
How do you know that this is not a dream?
Huangdi was a sage king in ancient times
Confucius is a Confucian saint
They are all symbols of China's orthodox order
However, Bai Juyi said
Who knows if they are not imaginary?
This is what Confucian culture sees
This is a very bold blasphemy against the saints.
Bai Juyi's doubt and confusion
In the later period of Chinese history
It is becoming more and more frequent and common
In traditional Chinese novels and dramas
There is often a kind of
Whether in the start-up or development stage
What a brilliant achievement
In the end, they will all turn to dust
Disappeared
The Lament of Returning to Nothingness
For example, there is a famous quote in the Qing Dynasty's Peach Blossom Fan:
"Seeing him build a red building
Seeing him entertain guests
I watched his building collapse.”
More famous
The song "Hao Le Ge" from Dream of the Red Chamber
This feeling of emptiness and despair
It is synchronized with the deepening of the degree of imperial autocracy in China.
Let’s go back to the Song Dynasty
Su Shi also expressed similar nihilism and doubt
He once wrote: How much can honor and disgrace be?
The joys and sorrows are endless
Looking back at the human world, nothing is true
It is also clearly expressed here
Doubt and nihilism about all values
However
Su Shi did not stop there
He also raised more pointed and dangerous questions
for example
Su Shi in his early and late years
For the Spring and Autumn Period
Duke Mu of Qin buried three ministers alive
There was a huge change in thinking
Here is the historical background
Duke Mu of Qin was a king who focused on discovering talents.
He used five sheepskins
In exchange for Baili Xi, who was still a slave at the time
Later, Baili Xi became a high-ranking official in the Qin State.
Under the reign of Duke Mu of Qin
The Qin State gathered a large number of talents
The country's power is gradually growing
From the traditional Chinese perspective
Duke Mu of Qi was a wise king.
But he has a huge flaw.
Has always been criticized
That is, before he died, he asked more than a hundred people to be buried with him.
Among them are Sanliang
That is, three good conducts
Officials who are popular with the public
After the death of these three officials
The Qin people felt very sad and grief-stricken.
Both the Records of the Grand Historian and the Zuo Zhuan were critical of Duke Mu of Qin
think
This reflects the backwardness and barbarity of the Qin Dynasty's system of burying people alive with the dead.
But some ancients believed
These three officials were
He promised to live and die together with the monarch
Therefore, their burial was not forced.
Just fulfilling the promise made to the king
Su Shi had this idea in his early years.
In one poem he said:
Ancient people were grateful for a meal and could still kill themselves
People today no longer see this, so they doubt the ancients based on what they see.
The ancients could not see this, and people today are even more saddened!
Su Shi believed
We cannot use later moral standards to judge ancient people.
Their behavior precisely embodies the spirit of loyalty
Sanliang's death was not forced
But I am willing to repay the king's kindness.
Just today's people
I just can't understand the nobility of the ancients.
However, in Su Shi's later years
His attitude towards this matter
A 180-degree turn
In this poem
Su Shi said: "In this life, Mount Tai is as heavy as a mountain.
Suddenly, a feather is left behind...
I am not a dog or a horse, so I ask you for a curtain!"
that is
The value of these three people as human beings is as heavy as Mount Tai.
Why should death be as light as a feather?
People are not dogs or horses.
Why beg the king?
This veil covering the corpse?
It is worth noting that
Criticisms of Duke Mu of Qin by ancient people
All from the perspective of the monarch's interests
It is believed that Duke Mu of Qin required a large number of his subjects to be buried alive
This led to the decline of Qin's national power.
Lost the qualification to compete
The same is true of the Confucian idea that "the people are more important than the king"
It is to remind the monarch to cherish the people's strength and pay attention to people's livelihood.
But in the final analysis
To ensure the long-term stability of the monarch's rule
However
Su Shi's criticism is based on the value of human beings.
Believe that people are not cattle and horses raised by the monarch
The monarch's words are also wrong
Of course the minister can disobey
This is of course a serious violation of the Confucian principle of ruler and subject.
For traditional Chinese culture
It can be said to be very bold and dangerous.
Therefore, in Chinese culture
Faced with so many internal and external troubles,
The science of physics came into being
The Differences between Neo-Confucianism and Ouyang Xiu, Shi Jie and Other Confucianists of the Song Dynasty
It is not about whether political reform is needed.
Issue administrative measures
Strengthen ideological education for the people, etc.
In the view of science
These things are just the surface.
They are keenly aware
Confucian culture itself faces a profound theoretical crisis
Fortresses are always breached from within
Therefore, it must be innovated from a philosophical perspective.
Improve the theoretical system
This will prevent the scholar-official class from wavering.
Use official language
It is to strengthen political determination
Ensure political beliefs remain unchanged
Political stance remains unchanged
So
How to strengthen the ideological construction of Confucianism itself?
We say
Traditional Confucianism is a secular utilitarianism
It does not care about the ontology of the universe and the world
Only concerned with practical effects
That is to govern the country and bring peace to the world
We see
Confucius and others explained many Confucian moral values
It's all from this perspective.
for example
Why should we be honest?
Should we have a spirit of benevolence?
Because it wins people's hearts
Make people love you, etc.
These strategies may be helpful
But it is not possible to
For the scholar-official class
Build a more stable belief system
Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism places more emphasis on
How to restore the spiritual faith of the scholar-official class
That is to enable them to believe in an unconditional
The divine and reasonable order
They will respond
It is a crisis of legitimacy of Chinese culture.
It is not a short-term political or social issue.
therefore
Zhu Xi attempted to reconstruct an omniscient cosmic system
That is the so-called natural order.
In the view of science
The reason why heaven is right
Because it permeates everything.
This is compared with the Confucianism of Dong Zhongshu in the Han Dynasty.
It can be said that it has become more rigorous.
The "Heaven" proposed by Dong Zhongshu
Is a personal God with emotions, will, likes and dislikes
People do things that violate the Three Bonds and Five Constant Virtues.
Will be punished by God
So Heaven is a supernatural fatherly authority.
But this explanation
More suitable for moral exhortation and intimidation
It has no way to face the kind of questioning that Bai Juyi asked
Because it makes the legitimacy of this system
Based on external, accidental causes
Zhu Xi's "Heavenly Principle" is the ontological structure of the universe.
He has no personality, no will.
It's not about scaring people by punishment.
on the contrary
Zhu Xi is speaking in a way that seems reasonable.
Tell you
The universe is an orderly
A system with an internal structure
You are just one of the differences.
“Reason” is the rule that exists in all things
It is the source of order everywhere
As big as rivers, lakes and seas
As small as a blade of grass
Although they look very different
But they all share one entity
That is the principle of heaven
They are all created from this entity.
so
Reason is the ontology of the universe
It is also the foundation of social ethics
From the perspective of ontology
This does make Confucian ethics seem more convincing.
Because it makes this order
Out of experience and historical contingency
No longer dependent on real-world effects
However, does this kind of thinking sound ridiculous?
Actually, I also think it's ridiculous
So how can we achieve this state?
The key lies in the pursuit of knowledge through investigation of things
The phrase "investigating things to gain knowledge" comes from a passage in "The Book of Rites" and "The Great Learning"
This sentence says:
In ancient times, those who wished to make the bright virtue known to the world,
Govern the country first
If you want to govern your country, you must first govern your family.
If you want to manage your family, you must first improve yourself.
If you want to improve yourself, you must first correct your mind.
If you want to straighten your heart, you must first be sincere in your intentions.
If you want to be sincere, you must first acquire knowledge, and acquiring knowledge lies in studying things.
That is to say, the root of everything lies in sincerity and uprightness.
Studying Things to Gain Knowledge
That is, to correct people's attitudes and understandings.
Zhu Xi extracted this passage from the University
As a program of science
Because it provides an important methodology
That is to say, a person must learn to learn from all things in nature.
Discovering the existence of the law of nature
Many people understand the concept of "investigating things to gain knowledge" as
Gaining knowledge by observing and studying everything
Actually
This is an understanding that comes from the influence of Western culture.
The Neo-Confucianism says that the study of things leads to knowledge.
That's not what I meant.
We know
In the 17th century, a kind of deism was popular in Europe.
For example, Newton believed that God created the universe.
But after creation
God will no longer intervene
Instead, let everything run according to the natural laws created by God.
Humans can learn, reason, deduce and experiment
Gradually discover the laws and rules hidden in nature
As the famous saying goes:
nature and nature's laws lay hid in night
However, science
It does not allow people to discover any new knowledge
It is not about asking people to reason and think.
Instead, it emphasizes the need to rely on the understanding and feeling of all things.
You will find that the law of nature is everywhere
And then experience a wonderful aesthetic realm
In this realm
Man and Heaven become one
So as to feel
The freedom of man's integration into the cosmic entity,
Happy state
for example
Let’s look at this poem by Zhu Xi:
A half-acre pond is open, and the light of the sky and the shadow of the water wander together
How can the water be so clear? Because it comes from a source of fresh water.
Let’s look at this poem now.
I think this is simply
Just describing a natural beauty
We will also feel beautiful
However, our sense of beauty in nature
There may be a variety of complex emotions behind it.
For example, a sense of freedom, a sense of insignificance,
Desolation, loneliness, etc.
We may also feel the wonders of nature.
Arousing curiosity about nature
and desire to explore
These are all very normal emotions.
However
The study of things to gain knowledge
Essentially a propositional essay
It is to regulate a person's aesthetic experience.
That is to say, when you face nature
You have to feel that order in everything.
Everything is so seamless
So that you can feel that you are one with the Way of Heaven.
In this case
Then individuals don't need to doubt anything anymore.
What to criticize
Loneliness, alienation, anxiety
They are all pathological deviations from the natural order.
The so-called "preserving the principles of heaven and eliminating human desires"
When your human desires are completely destroyed
The truth emerges from within
therefore
Science cultivates a refined and docile mentality
It turns numbness and escape
Cleverly packaged in a
Aesthetic experience of nature
Since everything is so harmonious and orderly
Then follow the ritual system established by the monarch
It is only natural to accept all the sufferings of reality
As the saying goes, "There is no obstacle for man in the world."
As long as you understand this state
You'll find nothing is holding you back.
But this is essentially a psychological massage
It is also a way to numb yourself to a spiritual victory.
As
We are talking about what Wang Yangming said in the video
Since the Song Dynasty
As the imperial power gradually expanded
The status of Confucian scholars became more humble
for example
More and more scholars and officials expressed their gratitude to the emperor.
Using the derogatory self-proclaimed title of "虮買小臣"
They increasingly compare themselves to dogs, horses, insects, and rats.
This just shows
The kind of spring and bright scenery advocated by Neo-Confucianism
Physical state of comfort
It's quite twisted in nature.
This seriously violates the true feelings of the parties involved.
This is similar to what is shown in the official video released by North Korea.
Every Korean is so enthusiastic.
Full of confidence
No worries or pain
But behind this confidence and enthusiasm
It's actually a pretty deep depression.
From here
We can also see a common phenomenon in Chinese society.
Many people have this kind of trouble.
They feel that the people around them
Seems to fit perfectly into the order
And looks happy
In this case
Then you feel anxious
It's because my heart is too dark and dirty.
Always focus on the negative things
Not broad-minded enough
This implies a kind of understanding
All emotional fluctuations of the individual
It's all a sign of insufficient personal moral cultivation.
Chinese culture is accustomed to using very simple things
Metaphor for ideal personality
For example, water, jade, and qi.
Their commonality is that they are all gentle and delicate
Water and air are clear and transparent
It can't maintain its shape.
Therefore, they are also the most able to integrate into everything.
They benefit all things without competing
Able to blend into the environment without resisting
This is also the ideal personality most respected by Neo-Confucianism.
That is pure and flawless, bright and upright,
Be consistent and selfless
However
This is actually a dangerous temptation.
and sophisticated discipline
A healthy personality
It is definitely not spotless and clean.
But there must be contradictions, desires or dark parts.
Even these things
It drives a person forward and explores
If a person is really like what rationalism advocates
Pure, desireless, gentle
Then he will lose his boundaries and judgment.
Becoming a model created by power
therefore
The collapse and paralysis of science is inevitable.
On the one hand, it emphasizes that the law of nature is all-encompassing.
Ubiquitous
But the way it perceives the world
But it is rigid, closed and single
turn out
It can only make people repeat the words of the saints over and over again
Close your eyes and ears
In this state
Yangming's philosophy of mind came into being
Compared with Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism
It looks more radical
More full of fantasy and mysterious colors
But it actually
It is just that Chinese culture is heading towards its end.
