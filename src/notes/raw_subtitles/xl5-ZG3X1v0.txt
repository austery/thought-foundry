[Music]


hi
 everybody
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 the
 CEO


of
 the
 Norwegian
 so
 wealth
 fund
 and


today
 I
 am
 in
 particularly
 good
 company


with
 David
 Rick
 the
 CEO
 of
 the
 Pharma


giant
 elil
 now
 lail
 is
 spearheading
 as


you
 may
 know
 the
 weight
 reducing
 drug


Revolution
 we
 own
 more
 than
 1%
 of
 the


company
 totaling
 $8
 billion
 big
 thanks


for
 coming
 Dave
 great
 to
 be
 with
 you


yeah
 now
 um
 the
 uh
 gp1
 drug
 sent
 uh


shock
 waves
 through
 the
 world
 and
 now


they
 seems
 to
 be
 curing
 everything
 from


alcoholism
 to
 Alzheimer
 so
 why
 are
 these


drugs
 so
 efficient
 yeah
 it's
 well
 it's


certainly
 been
 exciting
 time
 for
 the


company
 but
 also
 for
 medical
 science


because
 this
 is
 actually
 not
 a
 very
 new


idea
 to
 stimulate
 glp1
 um
 Lily
 launched


the
 first
 glp1
 Agonist
 in
 2006
 um
 so


almost
 20
 years
 ago
 um
 but
 it's
 a
 I


think
 a
 good
 example
 of
 how
 the


technology
 in
 medicine
 works
 is
 that


often
 times


um
 we
 know
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 the
 the
 major


theme
 but
 making
 a
 molecule
 making
 a


medicine
 that
 behaves
 with
 properties


that
 can
 um
 achieve
 optimal
 outcomes


takes
 time
 and
 effort
 and
 we're
 now
 on


our
 really
 our
 third
 generation
 of
 these


drugs
 with
 tpde
 which
 is
 a
 dual
 acting


so
 it's
 glp
 plus
 Gip
 two
 different
 gut


hormones
 you
 know
 I
 think
 by
 making


drugs
 that
 were
 flat
 and
 lasted
 a
 long


time
 and
 then
 we
 could
 dose
 a
 little


higher
 we've
 discovered
 that
 um
 we
 are


not
 just
 affecting
 blood
 sugar
 and
 other


you
 know
 metabolism
 factors
 but


affecting
 probably
 the
 brain
 and
 the


desire
 but
 when
 when
 when
 you
 discovered


it
 in
 2005
 2006
 it
 was
 more
 like
 a
 side


effect
 wasn't
 it
 the
 weight
 production


it
 was
 a
 positive
 side
 effect
 in
 fact
 a


cover
 of
 our
 annual
 report
 in
 2007
 has
 a


woman
 who
 took
 this
 medicine
 and
 she


said
 I'm
 my
 diabetes
 is
 under
 control


and
 I'm
 losing
 a
 little
 weight
 people


say
 I
 look
 better
 so
 she
 noticed
 it
 from


the
 beginning


it
 was
 not
 the
 design
 goal
 for
 that
 drug


exenatide
 it
 wasn't
 even
 the
 design
 goal


for
 the
 follow
 on
 to
 that
 which
 was
 a


weekly
 um
 medicine
 called
 trulicity
 or


dulaglutide
 it
 was
 a
 designed
 goal
 for


tepati
 which
 is
 these
 two
 act
 actions


for
 weight
 loss
 and
 whether
 the
 weight


loss
 itself
 has
 these
 broad
 effects
 you


mentioned
 uh
 dementia
 and
 Alzheimer's


and
 probably
 the
 effects
 there
 are
 more


vascular
 so
 similar
 to
 the


cardiovascular
 benefits
 probably


reducing
 strokes
 and
 Min
 Strokes
 that


needs
 to
 be
 proven
 but
 you
 know
 those


studies
 are
 getting
 done
 or
 this
 desire


Center
 where
 these
 these
 hormones
 are


our
 our
 stomach
 our
 gut
 secretes
 after


we
 eat
 tell
 our
 brain
 that
 we're
 full


and
 that
 that
 is
 also
 affecting
 alcohol


consumption
 cigarette
 smoking
 other
 kind


of
 hedonic
 behaviors
 humans
 have
 so


we're
 also
 studying
 those
 things
 because


um
 probably
 in
 modern
 society
 the
 things


that
 that
 harm
 us
 most
 are
 our
 own


behaviors
 so
 what
 are
 the
 other
 honic


desires
 that
 it
 can
 prevent
 well
 we
 know


smoking
 is
 a
 very
 strong
 signal
 and


you'll
 see
 Lily
 this
 this
 year
 conduct


large
 studies
 in
 smoking
 cessation
 which


is
 still
 a
 major
 problem
 uh
 particularly


in
 Asia
 um
 alcohol
 consumption
 is


something
 we
 immediately
 notied
 in
 our


studies
 and
 if
 you
 go
 back
 and
 look
 you


do
 see
 people
 self-reporting
 pretty


significant
 reductions
 in
 alcohol
 which


is
 also
 probably
 good
 for
 us
 um
 we're


also
 studying
 street
 drugs
 um
 and
 so


these
 are
 more
 complicated
 clinical


studies
 to
 undertake
 be
 for
 all
 kinds
 of


reasons
 they're
 illegal
 in
 many


countries
 and
 dose
 control
 and
 so
 forth


is
 difficult
 but
 that
 of
 course
 is
 a


Scourge
 particularly
 in
 my
 country
 in


the
 US
 the
 whole
 opioid
 crisis
 has
 been


terrible
 the
 probability
 that
 works


isn't
 as
 certain
 as
 something
 like


smoking
 um
 but
 I
 think
 we
 need
 to
 give


it
 a
 shot
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 Lily's


four
 is
 to
 take
 on
 big
 health
 problems


and
 obesity
 is
 a
 big
 one
 but
 but
 so
 is


opioid
 addiction
 so
 the
 Blue
 Sky


scenario
 here
 at
 10
 years
 from
 now
 what


could
 these
 stke
 do
 well
 I
 I
 think
 you


you
 can
 certainly
 see
 in
 our
 sites
 now
 I


think
 we
 have
 evidence
 from
 the
 last


year
 that
 not
 only
 do
 you
 lose
 weight


and
 for
 most
 people
 who
 are
 overweight


or
 obese
 can
 get
 to
 a
 healthy
 body


weight
 on
 tepati
 we
 have
 more
 medicines


coming
 by
 the
 way
 we
 could
 talk
 about


that
 for
 people
 with
 even
 higher
 body


weight
 or
 to
 be
 more
 scalable
 or
 more


convenient
 but
 I
 think
 we
 can
 easily
 say


that
 weight
 management
 will
 become
 more


like
 a
 choice


than
 an
 Affliction
 and
 that's
 good
 we


can
 also
 say
 that
 we've
 learned
 in
 the


last
 15
 months
 that
 major
 categories
 of


Downstream
 disease
 of
 obesity
 are


affected
 by
 weight
 loss
 induced
 by
 these


drugs
 that
 seems
 obvious
 but
 in
 hindsite


but
 you
 know
 it
 is
 a
 key
 question
 is
 not


do
 you
 just
 affect
 the
 kind
 of
 the


precondition
 but
 actually
 also
 the


disease
 cardiovascular
 risk
 which
 has


been
 shown
 um
 kidney
 disease
 um
 now
 uh


liver
 disease
 Etc
 so
 that's
 important


because
 those
 diseases
 make
 up
 about
 40%


of
 health
 care
 costs
 in
 in
 developed


economies
 so
 that's
 a
 blue
 sky
 scenario


by
 itself
 the
 trick
 there
 will
 be


scaling
 right
 because
 right
 now
 between


Lily
 and
 Nova
 Nordisk
 we
 may
 be
 serving


less
 than
 20
 million
 people
 on
 the


planet
 and
 there
 might
 be
 a
 billion


people
 with
 um
 o
 overweight
 or
 obesity


who
 are
 going
 to
 get
 these
 chronic


diseases
 stupid
 question
 but
 why
 are


there
 as
 many
 as
 one
 billion
 obese


people
 why
 is
 this
 increasing
 so
 much


you
 know
 it
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


theories
 it's
 a
 multiactor
 um
 disease
 or


process
 but
 in
 many
 ways
 like
 a
 lot
 of


chronic
 illnesses
 we
 have
 today
 were


actually
 survival
 biases
 of
 our


ancestors
 and
 food
 and
 nutrients
 are


obviously
 essential
 to
 life
 so
 you
 know


when
 our
 ancestors
 were
 running
 around


in
 the
 ice
 ages
 and
 you
 know
 looking
 for


food
 being
 a
 hoarder
 of
 calories
 and


preserving
 body
 weight
 was
 a
 was
 a


survival
 uh
 uh
 bias
 in
 our
 genome
 now


that's
 actually
 hurting
 us
 because
 we


live
 in
 a
 world
 of
 abundance
 and
 so
 I


think
 that's
 true
 around
 the
 world
 and


as
 developed
 economies
 rise
 and


middle-income
 countries
 go
 to
 developed


and
 vice
 and
 so
 forth
 Food
 Systems
 food


becomes
 more
 stable
 it
 becomes
 more


abundant
 it
 probably
 is
 less
 healthy
 for


us
 anyway
 than
 the
 foods
 our
 ancestors


ate
 um
 and
 more
 tasty
 and
 it's
 harder
 to


resist
 so
 there's
 definitely
 something


wrong
 in
 our
 food
 system
 I
 don't
 think


we
 should
 shy
 away
 from
 that


conversation
 but
 also
 abundance
 itself


is
 is
 part
 of
 the
 problem
 I
 think
 you've


said
 that
 he
 cost
 uh
 just
 under
 three


billion
 dollars
 to
 and
 takes
 10
 years
 to


discover
 or
 to
 discover
 a
 drug
 now
 like


in
 two
 minut
 is
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you


discover
 a
 drug
 yeah
 well
 maybe
 just
 a


step
 back
 what
 what
 we
 do
 is
 we
 make
 new


matter
 new
 molecules
 that
 uh
 interfere


with
 Biology
 the
 two
 classic
 problems
 in


drug
 Discovery
 are
 do
 I
 know
 the
 target


am
 I
 pointed
 at
 the
 right
 thing
 that
 is


causing
 the
 disease
 and
 then
 can
 I
 drug


the
 target
 um
 with
 maximum
 effect
 and


minimum
 side
 effects
 and
 that
 turns
 out


both
 those
 turn
 out
 to
 be
 very
 difficult


things
 we
 probably
 know
 10
 15%
 of
 all


biology
 so
 picking
 the
 targets
 is
 hard


and
 then
 drugging
 the
 targets
 is
 even


harder
 most
 the
 easy
 ones
 have
 turned


into
 drugs
 already
 um
 and
 many
 of
 those


were
 accidents
 of
 nature
 we
 we


discovered
 long
 ago
 and
 converted
 into


commercial
 drugs
 creating
 brand
 new


substances


um
 that
 behave
 like
 drugs
 against
 known


targets
 is
 challenging
 so
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 attrition
 for
 both
 those
 reasons


either
 the
 drug
 isn't
 good
 enough
 or
 the


target
 wasn't
 exactly
 right
 um
 so
 we


spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 and
 money
 and


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 failure
 the
 biggest


cost
 in
 drug
 development
 is
 failure
 um


most
 of
 the
 things
 we
 start
 don't


actually
 work
 but
 then
 we
 also
 need
 to


pursue
 drug
 new
 medicines
 in
 a
 way


that's
 safe
 right
 we
 can't
 Market
 things


that
 are
 unsafe
 and
 we
 need
 to
 have
 a


knowledge
 base
 that
 is
 evidence
 that


these
 things
 work


and
 that
 takes
 time
 and
 it's
 pretty


serial
 it's
 step
 by
 step
 um
 do
 most
 fmer


groups
 uh
 work
 the
 same
 way
 when
 it


comes
 to
 drug
 Discovery
 or
 have
 you
 got


a
 secret
 way
 of
 doing
 it
 in
 general
 yes


although
 you
 know
 in
 my
 tene
 at
 Lily


we've
 worked
 hard
 to
 do
 things
 a
 little


bit
 differently
 to
 improve
 the


productivity
 of
 R&D
 you
 know
 if
 we
 look


at
 um
 if
 we
 take
 out
 the
 the
 weight
 loss


companies
 of
 Lily
 and
 Novo
 from
 the


sector
 the
 the
 C
 the
 sector
 trades
 at


like
 12
 times
 earnings
 it
 and
 that's


really
 because
 Roi
 on
 R&D
 investment
 is


close
 to
 zero
 and
 we
 looked
 at
 that
 and


we
 said
 that's
 obviously
 not
 not
 an


equation
 we're
 happy
 with
 and
 tried
 to


control
 things
 we
 could
 control
 it's


hard
 to
 learn
 more
 about
 biology
 quickly


and
 it's
 very
 difficult
 to
 make
 new


drugs
 just
 better
 than
 others
 but
 we


worked
 on
 two
 things
 one
 was
 that
 the


time
 in
 which
 we
 take
 to
 make
 decisions


and
 move
 and
 the
 other
 is
 the
 asset


allocation
 type
 discussion
 of
 how
 far
 do


you
 spread
 your
 bets
 how
 do
 you
 make


decisions
 about
 when
 to
 quit
 um
 what


kind
 of
 uh
 evidence
 is
 sufficient
 to


keep
 going
 and
 setting
 a
 high
 bar
 there


for
 progression
 so
 in
 fact
 we're


actually
 killing
 projects
 earlier
 than


we
 ever
 did
 before
 and
 doing
 so
 with
 a


higher
 standard
 and
 we're
 doing
 it


faster
 what
 have
 you
 done
 with
 the
 time


how
 what's
 the
 what's
 the
 time
 spent
 now


compared
 to
 when
 you
 joined
 right
 so
 the


industry
 averages
 I
 can
 speak
 and
 in


2015
 when
 we
 looked
 at
 this
 we
 were
 a


little
 worse
 than
 industry
 average
 is


about
 10
 years
 in
 clinical
 development


so
 that's
 first
 human
 dose
 to
 approval


in
 some
 market
 and
 about
 four
 or
 five


years
 pre-clinically
 so
 in
 total
 almost


15
 years
 of
 time
 by
 the
 way
 our
 our


patent
 cycle
 um
 is
 we
 get
 a
 20-year


patent
 but
 once
 we
 exhaust
 all
 all
 that


time
 we
 end
 up
 with
 like
 10
 or
 12
 years


in
 market
 so
 this
 explains
 I
 think
 in


large
 part
 why
 return
 on
 investment
 in


our
 sector
 is
 so
 poor
 because
 it
 takes


you
 longer
 to
 develop
 a
 new
 thing
 then


you
 get
 to
 harvest
 the
 benefit
 of
 the


thing
 you
 just
 invented
 so
 we
 sought
 to


change
 that
 we've
 cut
 the
 preclinical


time
 roughly
 in
 half
 it
 takes
 us
 about


two
 and
 a
 half
 years
 to
 go
 from
 idea
 to


First
 dose
 and
 then
 about
 six
 years
 last


year
 5.9
 years
 to
 go
 from
 first
 dose
 to


approval
 so
 that's
 almost
 half
 the
 time


of
 our
 peers
 which
 is
 an
 enormous


structural
 Advantage
 we
 have
 if
 we
 can


repeat
 it
 what
 was
 the
 key
 to
 getting


there
 I
 mean
 these
 are
 very
 big
 numbers


yeah
 two
 things
 one
 is
 just
 good


old-fashioned
 kind
 of
 process


engineering
 basically
 doing
 everything


you
 can
 in
 parallel
 that
 puts
 some


Financial
 Risk
 in
 our
 process
 but
 just


to
 give
 a
 small
 example
 a
 lot
 of
 like


biotechs
 will
 wait
 till
 they
 get


compelling
 pre-clinical
 evidence
 in


animals
 their
 drug
 is
 working
 before


they
 run
 production
 and
 figure
 out


production
 to
 do
 to
 make
 doses
 for
 a


first
 human
 study
 and
 then
 that


production
 scale
 up
 part
 is
 on
 your


critical
 path
 we
 really
 don't
 do
 that


anymore
 we
 make
 we
 do
 that
 for


everything
 and
 then
 we
 just
 stop
 working


on
 it
 if
 the
 if
 the
 drug
 isn't
 working


in
 animals
 so
 we
 basically
 pull


timelines
 forward
 and
 do
 parallel


processing
 versus
 Cal
 that's
 a
 big
 tool


and
 there's
 many
 other
 examples
 of
 that


in
 the
 system
 of
 making
 new
 drugs


another
 one
 is
 decisionmaking
 time
 so
 we


used
 to
 like
 do
 an
 experiment
 and
 then


all
 gather
 around
 and
 ask
 new
 questions


and
 look
 at
 it
 and
 reprocess
 the
 data


and
 it
 was
 taking
 us
 sometimes
 nine
 to


uh
 nine
 weeks
 to
 six
 months
 to
 move
 from


step
 one
 step
 to
 another
 we
 really
 don't


do
 that
 anymore
 now
 we
 pre-specify
 what


we
 need
 to
 see
 to
 advance
 by
 the
 way


that
 improves
 decision
 quality
 and
 if
 we


hit
 that
 Target
 we
 just
 go
 the
 next
 day


if
 we
 miss
 the
 target
 we
 pause
 um


sometimes
 we
 re
 interrogate
 the
 data
 and


we
 end
 up
 going
 but
 most
 of
 the
 time


it's
 sped
 up
 our
 decision-making
 is
 this


all
 strictly
 analytical
 or
 is
 there
 an


element
 of
 gutfield
 to
 these
 decisions


there's
 judgment
 too
 right
 as
 I
 said


because
 we
 only
 know
 a
 certain
 amount
 of


biology
 human
 pattern
 recognition
 and


experience
 is
 very
 important
 on
 the


experience
 side
 I
 think
 Lily
 does
 also


have
 a
 structural
 Advantage
 you
 know
 we


used
 to
 get
 made
 fun
 of
 because
 we're


based
 in
 Indianapolis
 and
 sort
 of
 far


away
 from
 other
 drug
 companies
 but
 one


of
 the
 effects
 of
 that
 is
 people
 stay


here
 a
 long
 time
 living
 in
 this
 part
 of


the
 country
 is
 easy
 and
 people
 tend
 to


our
 average
 tenure
 for
 scientists
 at
 the


company
 is
 over
 10
 years
 that
 gives


people
 enough
 time
 to
 see
 the
 process


repeat
 itself
 and
 begin
 to
 recognize


patterns
 versus
 jump
 to
 another
 company


I
 think
 that's
 helped
 us
 along
 the
 way


and
 then
 having
 great
 people
 like
 like


you
 know
 our
 our
 our
 lead
 scientists
 in


the
 company
 Dan
 gansy
 and
 his
 team
 who


are
 just
 good
 at
 recognizing
 patterns


and
 are
 very
 good
 at
 abstracting


personal
 um
 preferences
 from
 the
 process


and
 I
 think
 like
 all
 capital
 allocation


that's
 a
 key
 thing
 in
 your
 business
 I'm


sure
 you
 see
 that
 as
 well
 you
 you
 have


to
 be
 dispassionate
 about
 ideas
 and
 in


big
 companies
 particularly
 in
 our


industry
 that's
 been
 a
 problem
 people


want
 to
 work
 on
 the
 projects
 that
 they


think
 the
 leader
 like


and
 that
 ends
 up
 in
 pretty
 bad
 decision


making
 so
 how
 many
 like
 super
 key
 people


would
 you
 have
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 picking


the
 right
 projects
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


everyone's
 key
 but
 probably
 at
 the


leadership
 level
 in
 Lily
 research
 Labs


there's
 20
 to
 30
 people
 that
 are
 making


the
 core
 decisions
 across
 all


therapeutic
 areas
 how
 does
 AI
 help
 you


or
 will
 help
 you
 yeah
 it's
 already


helping
 us
 in
 many
 ways
 and
 I
 think
 I'm


a
 really
 positive
 you
 know
 optimist


about
 AI
 not
 in
 our
 only
 in
 our
 sector


but
 in
 all
 sectors
 you
 know
 on
 the
 drug


Discovery
 side
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 hype


about
 companies
 that
 are
 forming
 and
 say


we'll
 just
 turn
 on
 a
 computer
 and
 write


some
 code
 and
 we'll
 invent
 new
 drugs
 I


do
 not
 think
 we're
 close
 to
 that
 um
 that


wet
 lab
 validation
 and
 having
 really


strong
 data
 sets
 to
 make
 predictions
 is


critical
 more
 likely
 Ai
 and
 what
 we're


using
 it
 for
 now
 is
 a
 much
 more
 graner


tool
 to
 predict
 IND
 idual
 experiments
 in


some
 cases
 don't
 even
 conduct
 them


because
 we
 don't
 think
 they're
 worth
 it


the
 drug
 won't
 succeed
 and
 knocking


things
 out
 earlier
 or
 enhancing


experiments
 with
 synthetic
 data
 and


enriching
 sort
 of
 how
 we
 look
 at
 those


results
 that's
 already
 happening
 now
 but


these
 are
 micro
 steps
 in
 drug


development
 versus
 some
 sort
 of
 magic
 um


turn
 on
 a
 machine
 and
 make
 it
 happen
 all


at
 once
 but
 that
 makes
 our
 scientists


move
 faster
 and
 makes
 their
 their
 their


um
 laboratory
 experience
 more
 valuable


um
 and
 I
 think
 both
 those
 things
 are


helping
 us
 today
 in
 the
 end
 I'm
 excited


about
 the
 use
 of
 um
 generative
 and


diffusion
 models
 to
 help
 our
 chemists
 so


chemistry
 is
 a
 particularly
 difficult


part
 of
 what
 we
 do
 the
 chemical
 space
 is


vast
 like
 10
 to
 the
 60th
 so
 it's
 more


stars
 than
 are
 in
 the
 universe
 kind
 of


possibilities
 and
 humans
 are
 pretty


constrained
 in
 our
 thinking
 so
 like
 when


you
 use
 uh
 chat
 gbt
 or
 dolly
 or
 one
 of


these
 tools
 to
 make
 a
 silly
 image
 or


something
 and
 it
 comes
 up
 with
 something


odd
 and
 creative
 the
 machine
 does
 that


with
 chemistry
 as
 well
 that's
 not
 going


to
 be
 a
 drug
 but
 it
 gives
 our
 chemist


new
 starting
 points
 that
 they
 didn't


consider
 before
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 that


long
 term
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very


interesting
 for
 our
 sector
 and
 then


there's
 many
 other
 parts
 like
 other


industrial
 companies
 were
 already


scaling
 Ai
 and
 it's
 making
 a
 very
 large


difference
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important


ones
 last
 year
 was
 in
 produ
 uction


optimization
 so
 we
 have
 we're
 scaling


our
 gp1s
 as
 you
 know
 and
 that's
 been
 a


key
 constraint
 to
 growth
 of
 the
 company


with
 like
 one
 small
 intervention
 we
 did


introduced
 about
 an
 8%
 process
 effic


efficiency
 in
 a
 key
 bottleneck
 in


production
 it
 allowed
 us
 to
 ship
 about


seven
 or
 eight%
 more
 product
 last
 year


in
 that
 line
 and
 as
 you
 know
 that's


worth
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 or
 maybe
 a


billion
 dollars
 in
 Revenue
 so
 when
 you


have
 implemented
 AI
 fully
 in
 all
 parts


of
 the
 company
 how
 much
 quicker
 will


your
 process


I
 think
 we
 could
 cut
 times
 in
 half
 again


if
 we're
 successful
 there
 are
 some


things
 that
 are
 real
 constraints
 because


like
 disease
 processes
 many
 of
 the
 ones


we
 study
 are
 slow
 and
 there
 is
 no


replacing
 um
 the
 watching
 of
 someone
 on


a
 drug
 or
 not
 on
 a
 drug
 take
 like


Alzheimer's
 disease
 this
 is
 a
 seven-year


process
 from
 diagnosis
 to
 death
 and
 we


need
 to
 study
 a
 meaningful
 part
 of
 that


to
 prove
 a
 medicine
 is
 working
 there's


no
 getting
 around
 that
 human
 disease


process
 but
 many
 of
 the
 other
 things


that
 lead
 up
 to
 that
 final
 study
 we


could
 potentially
 do
 much
 quicker
 and


I'd
 be
 I'd
 be
 excited
 to
 see
 that
 happen


how
 much
 easier
 is
 the
 whole
 uh
 process


uh
 to
 do
 in
 the
 US
 compared
 to
 Europe


drug
 Discovery
 and
 development
 yeah
 it's


not
 that
 different
 actually
 between
 the


two
 markets
 we
 have
 huge
 operations
 in


Europe
 as
 we
 do
 in
 the
 US
 those
 are
 our


two
 centers
 for
 both
 production
 and


science
 clinical
 trials
 as
 well
 as


Discovery
 probably
 more
 Discovery
 in
 the


US
 and
 um
 proportionately
 more
 clinical


trials
 in
 Europe
 the
 thing
 that's


different
 in
 the
 is
 the
 market
 side
 so


the
 adoption
 of
 technology
 in
 Europe
 is


super
 slow
 in
 the
 US
 is
 quite
 a
 bit


faster
 and
 I
 that's
 a
 problem
 for
 us
 in


terms
 of
 our
 interest
 in
 the
 European


continent
 because
 we
 are
 on
 the
 clock


with
 our
 patent
 life
 and
 if
 a
 meaningful


part
 of
 that
 is
 absorbed
 with
 the


government
 processes
 to
 get
 a
 drug


approved
 and
 get
 it
 uh
 on
 formularies
 in


countries
 and
 then
 go
 through
 procedures


at
 the
 hospital
 level
 to
 get
 used
 it's


really
 a
 waste
 um
 for
 for
 us
 but
 also


for
 patients
 who
 can't
 access
 the
 the


medicine
 from
 your
 start
 a
 pro
 uh
 a


project
 until
 you
 start
 to
 sell
 the
 drug


what's
 the
 time
 difference
 between


Europe
 and
 the
 US
 well
 everything's
 the


same
 up
 until
 submission
 we
 typically


submit
 in
 the
 US
 first
 and
 then
 within
 a


few
 weeks
 into
 Europe
 it's
 normal
 for
 us


to
 have
 approval
 in
 Europe
 three
 to
 four


months
 after
 um
 this
 is
 in
 the
 EU
 after


um
 the
 US
 and
 then
 the
 a
 way
 to
 think


about
 it
 is
 what's
 your
 average
 time
 to


real
 patient
 access
 on
 the
 ground
 and
 in


Europe
 that's
 a
 little
 over
 two
 years


post
 approval
 so
 it's
 the
 four
 months


plus
 24
 more
 months
 so
 here
 we're
 you


know
 almost
 out
 to
 two
 and
 a
 half
 years


later
 and
 that's
 painful
 because
 it's


slow
 but
 it's
 worse
 even
 than
 that


because
 what
 that
 means
 is
 you
 have
 two


and
 a
 half
 years
 less
 out
 of
 10
 to
 12


years
 to
 commercialize
 your
 product
 so


it's
 really
 a
 drag
 on
 um
 on
 value


creation
 for
 us
 and
 the
 Healthcare


System
 we
 think
 the
 medicines
 we
 make


are
 valuable
 for
 the
 healthcare
 system


and
 patients
 that's
 a
 tax
 on
 that
 as


well
 is
 Europe
 doing
 anything
 to
 rectify


this
 situation
 there's
 discussions
 about


it
 we've
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 dialogue
 in
 the


European
 Parliament
 about
 the
 access


differences
 between
 the
 27
 member
 states


and
 um
 most
 of
 what's
 come
 out
 of
 that


are
 sticks
 not
 carrots
 we'd
 like
 to
 see


incentives
 for
 countries
 to
 move
 faster


and
 even
 an
 idea
 that
 why
 don't
 we


presume
 coverage
 and
 then
 eliminate


drugs
 that
 are
 less
 valuable
 through
 the


process
 and
 and
 red
 tape
 versus
 the


other
 way
 around
 right
 now
 most
 European


countries
 presume
 no
 value
 for
 new
 drugs


and
 then
 go
 through
 a
 process
 to
 see
 if


there's
 any
 value
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 the


fundamental
 issue
 plus
 you
 know
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 national
 competence
 running
 your


Healthcare
 System
 and
 there's
 National


differences
 that
 are
 difficult
 to
 work


through
 uh
 I
 wish
 I
 was
 an
 optimist


about
 reducing
 European
 bureaucracy
 I'm


not
 what
 about
 China
 what's
 the


situation
 in
 China
 the
 reverse
 frankly


so
 you
 I
 used
 to
 run
 our
 Chinese


business
 about
 15
 years
 ago
 and
 at
 that


time
 the
 drug
 lag
 between
 the
 US
 and


China
 that's
 what
 we
 would
 call
 that


patient
 access
 so
 if
 it's
 two
 and
 a
 half


years
 for
 Europe
 at
 the
 time
 it
 was


seven
 years
 for
 China
 so
 medicines
 we


were
 launching
 had
 been
 launched
 seven


years
 ago
 in
 the
 US
 right
 now
 that
 lag


is
 coming
 down
 to
 less
 than
 12
 months
 so


already
 China
 has
 Lea
 frogged
 over


Europe
 in
 the
 drug
 lag
 and
 their
 goal
 is


to
 be
 the
 first
 place
 we
 launch
 things


in
 the
 world
 so
 they're
 ambitious
 as


they
 can
 be
 their
 regulatory
 system
 has


improved
 dramatically
 and
 almost


harmonized
 with
 um
 the
 major
 other


Regulators
 like
 EMA
 in
 Europe
 FDA
 and


Japan
 in
 terms
 of
 standards
 and
 review


times
 it's
 still
 a
 little
 slower
 on


Market
 access
 it's
 a
 calendarized


process
 so
 if
 you
 launch
 on
 January
 5th


um
 you
 actually
 cannot
 get
 on
 the


formularies
 until
 January
 of
 the
 next


year
 so
 that's
 a
 problem
 if
 you
 launch


on
 December
 5th
 you
 get
 you
 can
 get
 on


in
 a
 few
 months
 so
 uh
 we
 like
 to
 see


that
 changed
 but
 they
 they've
 made
 a
 lot


of
 strides
 uh
 in
 kind
 of
 modernizing


their
 health
 system
 and
 what
 about
 the


drug
 Discovery
 coming
 out
 of
 gy
 yeah


it's
 tremendous
 uh
 those
 are
 both


collaborators
 and
 competitors
 for
 all


major
 companies
 and
 I
 pay
 Keen
 attention


to
 those
 developments
 there
 are
 some


scaled
 um
 biotech
 companies
 there
 many


of
 which
 we
 are
 partnered
 with
 in
 China


and
 outside
 of
 it
 there
 are
 emerging
 um


small
 biotech
 um
 clusters
 there
 mostly


working
 on
 known
 targets
 so
 if
 you
 go


back
 to
 what
 I
 said
 what
 are
 the
 two


problems
 in
 drug
 development
 what's
 the


right
 Target
 and
 then
 can
 I
 make
 a
 good


medicine
 that
 only
 hits
 that
 Target


they're
 mostly
 working
 on
 that
 second


problem
 and
 I
 think
 that
 leads
 to
 more


me
 better
 me
 too
 kind
 of
 drugs
 and


that's
 probably
 part
 of
 any
 country
 um


building
 an
 Innovative
 ecosystem
 um


eventually
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 work


on
 discovering
 new
 targets
 which
 mostly


happens
 in
 the
 west
 now
 but
 um
 you
 know


I
 I
 bet
 they'll
 be
 a
 leader
 in
 that
 too


they
 have
 tremendous
 scientific


capabilities
 now
 you
 have
 a
 business


background
 right
 yeah
 what
 do
 you
 think


you
 do
 differently
 compared
 to
 if
 you


had
 had
 a
 far
 more
 background
 well
 I
 I


think
 the
 people
 say
 background
 I
 mean


we
 could
 I
 spent
 you
 know
 four
 years
 in


undergrads
 studying
 engineering
 business


and
 then
 two
 years
 getting
 an
 MBA
 but


I've
 spent
 28
 years
 working
 in
 a
 Pharma


company
 so
 I
 probably
 know
 a
 lot
 more


about
 the
 pharmaceutical
 industry
 in
 all


parts
 than
 I
 would
 about
 a
 general


business
 thing
 just
 because
 I
 study
 it


in
 school
 I'm
 a
 big
 believer
 in


continuous
 learning
 and
 I
 spend
 a
 lot
 of


time
 on
 that
 myself
 and
 I
 think


curiosity
 is
 a
 fundamental
 leadership


trait
 because
 it
 allows
 you
 to
 grow
 but


it
 also
 is
 infectious
 you
 know
 people


who
 work
 with
 me
 I
 think
 notice
 what
 I


spend
 time
 learning
 and
 they
 want
 to


learn
 and
 that
 becomes
 part
 of
 the


culture
 of
 the
 company
 and
 I
 think
 a


company
 at
 scale
 that
 can
 learn
 faster


than
 others
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 better


company
 so
 um
 there's
 a
 trickle
 down
 to


that
 and
 plus
 I
 love
 learning
 so
 I
 I


often
 I
 think
 surprise
 people
 when
 I'm


sitting
 in
 scientific
 meetings
 asking


detailed
 questions
 I
 read
 ahead
 I
 don't


know
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 fundamental
 biology


basis
 but
 I
 learn
 a
 lot
 about
 a
 few


things
 uh
 that
 are
 highly
 relevant
 to


our
 business
 scientifically
 and
 I
 enjoy


that
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 helped
 us
 uh


perform
 better
 how
 do
 you
 permeate
 that


culture
 of
 learning
 into
 the


organization
 I
 think
 you
 know
 like
 a
 lot


of
 things
 that
 scale
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


little
 bit
 of
 everything
 but
 one
 of
 the


things
 I've
 noticed
 in
 my
 career
 um


whether
 it
 be
 leading
 a
 bus
 like
 our


operation
 in
 China
 or
 even
 a
 smaller


group
 earlier
 in
 my
 career
 as
 the
 CEO
 is


um
 we
 can
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 things


intentionally
 but
 um
 those
 aren't
 the


always
 the
 things
 that
 make
 the
 biggest


difference
 I
 think
 people
 pay
 attention


in
 two
 other
 things
 what
 are
 your
 daily


habits
 and
 the
 culture
 is
 not
 what's
 on


the
 slide
 or
 you
 know
 the
 words
 in
 the


lobby
 it's
 what
 people
 do
 and
 people


notice
 what
 leaders
 do
 and
 they


particularly
 notice
 what
 leaders
 do
 when


they're
 under
 pressure
 you
 know
 what
 is


when
 things
 are
 going
 wrong
 what
 do
 you


do
 and
 so
 I
 think
 having
 that
 curious


mindset
 you
 know
 as
 Satia
 nadela
 my


friend
 says
 is
 you
 know
 a
 learn
 it
 all


versus
 know-
 itall
 kind
 of
 culture
 um
 is


one
 of
 those
 indirect
 things
 that
 flows


through
 the
 company
 and
 I
 think
 it
 also


makes
 work
 joyful
 to
 me
 uh
 so
 you
 know


that
 that's
 something
 that
 we
 bed
 here


at
 Lily
 and
 probably
 have
 well
 before
 I


got
 here
 but
 but
 have
 continued
 so
 what


does
 uh
 David
 rcks
 do
 when
 he's
 under


pressure
 I
 drive
 speed
 you've
 talked


about
 that
 here
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 um


getting
 all
 the
 facts
 on
 the
 table
 are


important
 but
 then
 acting
 with
 some


emergency
 is
 important
 um
 no
 choice
 is
 a


choice
 um
 and
 I
 think
 moving
 is


important
 um
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 also


to
 hear
 I
 really
 value
 the
 direct


knowledge


and
 so
 quite
 often
 um
 people
 who
 work


with
 me
 get
 frustrated
 because
 I'll
 ask


to
 talk
 to
 the
 people
 actually
 doing
 the


thing
 um
 at
 the
 most
 basic
 level
 and
 um


often
 those
 people
 are
 they're
 very


specific
 on
 their
 test
 but
 I
 kind
 of
 I


really
 want
 to
 know
 what's
 happening
 and


why
 and
 then
 you
 know
 I
 think
 it's


important
 to
 get
 an
 outside
 perspective


before
 you
 move
 forward
 and
 often
 I'll


spend
 time
 I
 think
 particular
 for
 CEOs


we
 have
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 outside
 voices
 um


and
 I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on
 that
 um
 but


you
 know
 you
 mentioned
 sa
 Adella
 who
 uh


you
 know
 has
 been
 on
 the
 podcast
 and
 we


recommend
 you
 to
 listen
 to
 that
 but


another
 one
 is
 the
 CEO
 of
 adobe
 where


you
 on
 the
 board
 yeah
 Ryan
 he's
 a
 good


friend
 of
 mine
 and
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 I


joined
 that
 board
 is
 I
 have
 so
 much


respect
 for
 him
 and
 when
 I
 was
 a
 new
 CEO


just
 and
 joining
 another
 company
 board


one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 things
 to
 me


was
 learning
 in
 the
 boardroom
 especially


bit
 even
 outside
 of
 that
 from
 a
 veteran


and
 shotu
 had
 been
 in
 that
 uh
 seat
 for


about
 nine
 years
 at
 the
 time
 and
 one
 of


the
 it's
 interesting
 you
 know
 in
 the
 US


model
 we
 we
 have
 more
 of
 a
 chair
 CEO


combo
 roles
 but
 that
 I
 was
 much
 more


equipped
 to
 be
 a
 CEO
 than
 a
 chair
 when
 I


got
 that
 job
 um
 and
 I
 really
 had
 never


run
 a
 board
 or
 spent
 much
 time
 in
 one
 um


and
 he
 really
 helped
 me
 with
 that
 in
 in


a
 lot
 of
 ways
 what
 are
 the
 other
 things


you've
 learned
 from
 Adobe
 which
 you
 have


implemented
 Tech
 Cadence
 and
 the
 way


Tech
 drives
 business
 value
 through


continuous
 Improvement
 our
 industry
 is


more
 about
 these
 tidal
 wave
 improvements


you
 know
 these
 big
 step
 functions
 we


talked
 about
 gop1
 which
 is
 obviously
 a


mega
 um
 kind
 of
 innovation
 wave
 in
 in


the
 pharmaceutical
 sector
 Tech
 has
 those


two
 but
 like
 we've
 seen
 recently
 with
 AI


but
 they
 also
 are
 very
 good
 at
 grinding


out
 lots
 of
 incremental
 wins
 and
 doing


it
 at
 a
 Cadence
 that
 is
 measured
 in


months
 and
 weeks
 not
 years
 and
 I
 think


that's
 something
 Pharma
 could
 really


learn
 from
 sometimes
 incremental


improvements
 create
 a
 lot
 of
 value
 um


and
 we
 don't
 set
 ourselves
 up
 our
 wheel


is
 turning
 on
 that
 10
 to
 14e
 clock
 we


talked
 about
 earlier
 not
 on
 the


six-month
 um
 so
 we've
 tried
 to
 do
 some


of
 those
 things
 both
 with
 the
 product


itself
 that
 you
 buy
 at
 the
 pharmacy
 but


also
 some
 of
 the
 old
 other
 tangental


products
 a
 good
 example
 of
 that
 is
 is


the
 service
 you
 get
 from
 procuring
 our


medicine
 um
 you
 know
 we've
 stood
 up
 in


the
 US
 and
 now
 four
 other
 markets
 a


direct
 Pharmacy
 model
 so
 we're
 selling


directly
 to
 Consumers
 and
 why
 are
 we


doing
 that
 because
 that's
 actually


people
 attribute
 that
 experience
 to
 the


medicine
 as
 well
 so
 we
 can
 innovate
 in
 a


different
 way
 because
 it's
 not
 a


medicine
 a
 physical
 thing
 it's
 a
 digital


product
 um
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 helping


change
 our
 company
 in
 important
 ways
 I


mean
 that's
 an
 idea
 that
 came
 came
 to
 us


through
 through
 some
 of
 the
 work
 with


the
 tech
 Partners
 what
 are
 the
 other


ways
 you
 can
 get
 higher
 Tech
 Cadence


into
 a
 large
 company
 well
 I
 think
 being


being
 more
 able
 to
 begin
 with
 right
 so


you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 things
 about
 tech


companies
 is
 that
 because
 they
 don't


have
 a
 physical
 product
 they're
 changing


bits
 not
 atoms
 they
 can
 move
 at
 a


different
 speed
 because
 that's
 how


that's
 how
 software
 works
 the
 more


software
 enabled
 our
 systems
 are


actually
 the
 faster
 we
 can
 make
 changes


versus
 Hardware
 enabled
 so
 I
 I
 think


that's
 a
 key
 insight
 and
 um
 you
 know
 I


think
 examples
 of
 that
 could
 be
 like
 in


our
 production
 systems
 about
 10
 years


ago
 we
 started
 moving
 to
 a
 much
 more


digitally
 controlled
 and
 um
 kind
 of
 more


multimodal
 control
 of
 our
 production


systems
 versus
 fixed
 kind
 of
 operations


so
 we
 can
 make
 changes
 to
 input
 parts
 to


process
 design
 to
 regulatory


requirements
 through
 software
 now
 uh
 not


by
 actually
 reconfiguring
 physically


lines
 I
 think
 that's
 an
 important
 type


of
 example
 of
 that
 or
 if
 let's
 just
 say


we
 get
 to
 50%
 of
 our
 pre-clinical


laboratory
 experiments
 are
 predictive
 in


silico
 not
 in
 wet
 lab
 we
 can
 make
 those


moves
 much
 more
 quickly
 as
 well
 so
 they


have
 a
 built-in
 Advantage
 because
 they


work
 in
 the
 world
 of
 atoms
 not
 bits
 or


bits
 not
 atoms
 the
 more
 we
 get
 to
 bits


the
 better
 that
 said
 a
 business
 based
 on


atoms
 is
 has
 a
 bigger
 moat
 right
 because


your
 competitors
 also
 have
 those
 same


sticky
 difficult
 problems
 to
 make


physical
 products
 to
 scale
 them
 to
 make


them
 work
 in
 the
 physical
 world
 we're


not
 abandoning
 that
 that's
 actually
 our


core
 strategic
 advantage
 but
 I
 think


combining
 the
 two
 could
 be
 super


powerful
 and
 then
 there's
 a
 cultural


piece
 about
 expectations
 that
 comes
 from


software
 which
 is
 this
 incredible
 sense


of
 urgency
 because
 you
 can
 just
 get


displaced
 at
 any
 moment
 um
 and
 I
 think


sometimes
 farmer
 companies
 get
 a
 little


complacent
 because
 it's
 hard
 to
 displace


what
 we
 do
 moving
 on
 to
 um
 pricing
 what


is
 the
 most
 difficult
 ethical
 dilemma


you
 are
 facing
 when
 it
 comes
 to


affordability
 versus
 profits
 yeah
 I


think
 we
 have
 many
 ethical
 dilemmas
 in


our
 business
 because
 health
 is
 so


personal


and
 there
 is
 an
 ethos
 around
 universal


healthcare
 this
 is
 a
 core
 one
 there
 are


others
 too
 I
 would
 say
 but
 um
 what
 is
 a


fair
 return
 for
 an


innovator
 and
 I
 think
 there's
 H
 brackets


on
 that
 um


one
 perspective
 which
 had
 been
 pursued


by
 the
 industry
 we
 don't
 pursue
 is
 that


you
 know
 it's
 what
 the
 market
 will
 bear


I
 I
 think
 that
 probably
 steps
 across


ethical
 lines
 for
 many
 actors
 in
 the


health
 system
 system
 and
 we
 we
 actually


don't
 pursue
 pricing
 that
 way
 but
 you


can
 imagine
 desperate
 people
 who
 are
 um


need
 a
 medicine
 to
 survive
 um
 you
 can


get
 into
 uh
 price
 points
 that
 are
 really


exorbitant
 um
 and
 maybe
 make
 a


short-term
 return
 but
 you'll
 probably
 be


either
 legislated
 or


um
 um
 sued
 out
 of
 business
 if
 you
 pursue


that
 forever
 um
 you
 know
 there's
 on
 the


other
 Spectrum
 there's
 a
 marginal
 cost


plus
 take
 all
 input
 costs
 including


research
 and
 we'll
 add
 something
 to
 it


but
 I
 think
 the
 the
 risks
 that
 fails
 to


account
 for
 the
 risks
 in
 our
 business


which
 are
 very
 significant
 compared
 to


other
 um
 established
 businesses
 and
 the


the
 return
 on
 that
 risk
 as
 you
 would


know
 needs
 to
 be
 substantial
 because
 um


things
 can
 go
 wrong
 they
 don't
 go
 wrong


quickly
 so
 the
 problem
 we
 have
 in


explaining
 that
 Nikolai
 is
 is
 it
 just


seems
 like
 everything's
 okay
 tomorrow


and
 the
 next
 day
 and
 the
 next
 day
 um


they
 go
 wrong
 slowly
 and
 then
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 and
 that's
 the
 patent
 cycle


problem
 we
 faced
 right
 so
 once
 a
 drug


has
 been
 proven
 and
 is
 widely


distributed
 and
 is
 helping
 millions
 of


people
 that's
 when
 those
 arguments
 come


in
 of
 oh
 Cost
 Plus
 but
 we
 wouldn't
 have


had
 the
 thing
 to
 begin
 with
 because
 no


one
 would
 have
 undertaken
 the
 risks
 to


invent
 it
 we
 pursue
 more
 of
 a
 value


approach
 what
 is
 the
 displacement
 of


other
 costs
 in
 the
 Healthcare
 System


certainly
 we
 deserve
 credit
 for
 that
 and


then
 what
 is
 the
 value
 creation
 beyond


that
 that
 that
 can
 occur
 you
 know
 for


instance
 with
 our
 weight
 loss
 drugs


there's
 emerging
 evidence
 that


absenteeism
 drops
 in
 the
 workplace
 when


people
 are
 on
 them
 maybe
 that's
 because


reduced
 alcohol
 consumptions
 or
 other


health
 factors
 there's
 indirect
 things


like
 joint
 and
 knee
 pain
 drop
 so
 hip


replacements
 and
 knee
 Replacements
 are


slowing
 in
 populations
 using
 our
 drugs


well
 we
 probably
 should
 get
 some
 credit


for
 that
 as
 well
 so
 you
 know
 our
 idea
 is


that
 we
 capture
 some
 not
 all
 of
 the


direct
 and
 in
 indirect
 value
 we
 create


during
 the
 patent
 period
 and
 then
 we


remind
 policy
 makers
 that
 one
 of
 the


great
 gifts
 of
 our
 industry
 is
 that


everything
 we
 pursue
 everything
 we


invent
 goes
 to
 zero
 for
 us
 and
 goes
 to


Infinity
 for
 society
 because
 generic


drugs
 are
 such
 a
 great
 deal
 for
 Health


Care
 Systems
 we
 invented
 Prozac
 you
 know


40
 years
 ago
 it's
 a
 standard
 of
 care


globally
 for
 treating
 major
 depressive


disorder
 it
 costs
 in
 major
 markets
 about


four
 or
 five
 cents
 a
 day
 it's
 virtually


free
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 tremendous


gift
 to
 society
 we
 don't
 claim
 we
 don't


want
 credit
 uh
 for
 that
 directly
 but
 we


I
 think
 deserve
 more
 credit
 on
 patent


because
 of
 that
 so
 now
 you
 and
 I
 we
 come


out
 of
 the
 lab
 we've
 discovered
 GP
 1
 we


we're
 pretty
 pleased
 right
 uh
 and
 we


realize
 that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 lead
 to


less
 people
 being
 aw
 from
 the
 jobs
 less


alcoholism
 all
 that
 kind
 of
 thing
 now


who's
 around
 the
 table
 when
 we
 decide


how
 to
 price
 it
 I
 mean
 it's
 an


evolutionary
 process
 but
 we
 begin
 with


the
 outside
 in
 we
 talk
 to
 Health
 Systems


directly
 and
 understand
 how
 they
 think


about
 it
 we
 look
 at
 at
 our
 data
 sets
 so


around
 the
 table
 before
 we
 walk
 out
 of


the
 labs
 is
 well
 what
 could
 this


medicine
 do
 and
 how
 do
 we
 in
 a
 full
 way


try
 to
 capture
 analytically
 those


benefits
 and
 sometimes
 we
 do
 a
 good
 job


of
 predicting
 those
 things
 in
 the
 case


of
 gp1s
 or
 incron
 we've
 not
 done
 a
 great


job
 because
 we
 undershot
 I
 think
 the


broad
 benefits
 of
 these
 medicines
 so


then
 we
 look
 at
 real
 world
 evidence
 and


work
 backwards
 there
 was
 an
 important


study
 we
 were
 part
 of
 at
 the
 Veterans


Administration
 in
 the
 US
 that
 came
 out


two
 weeks
 ago
 that
 looked
 at
 all
 these


non-metabolic
 factors
 and
 showed


benefits
 for
 you
 know
 schizophrenia
 for


major
 depressive
 disorder
 for
 alcoholism


Etc
 and
 so
 then
 we
 quantify
 that
 and


then
 you
 know
 we
 we
 ask
 ourselves
 what's


a
 fair
 share
 of
 the
 value
 we've
 created


some
 of
 these
 values
 are
 quite
 certain


some
 of
 them
 are
 uh
 probabilistic
 and
 so


we
 make
 estimates
 about
 that
 and
 we
 try


to
 form
 a
 price
 perspective
 that
 way
 so


Financial
 people
 are
 there
 scientific


people
 are
 there
 and
 people
 who
 talk
 to


customers
 are
 there
 there
 talking
 about


people
 being
 away
 from
 from
 work
 so
 we


take
 more
 medicine
 than
 before
 we
 are
 in


a
 way
 more
 healthy
 than
 before
 but
 yet


um
 sickness
 leave
 is
 just
 going
 up
 right


in
 this
 country
 it's
 I
 think
 we
 are


hitting
 7%
 why
 why
 is
 sickness
 leave


going
 up
 when
 we
 are
 becoming


healthier
 well
 I
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 a
 clear


answer
 for
 that
 I
 think
 in
 when
 you're


talking
 about
 your
 country
 Norway
 is


that
 what
 you're
 talking
 about
 the
 7%


yeah
 in
 the
 US
 it's
 it's
 it
 Rose
 a
 lot


during
 Co
 it
 seems
 to
 be
 coming
 down
 a


little
 bit
 now
 but
 one
 thing
 a
 lot
 of


experts
 point
 to
 is
 mental
 health
 so
 um


while
 we
 we
 are
 better
 at
 addressing


physical
 health
 than
 ever
 before
 life


expectancy
 in
 most
 countries
 is
 rising


the
 US
 is
 an
 exception
 we
 can
 talk
 about


that
 if
 you'd
 like
 even
 with
 the


background
 Rising
 obesity
 rates
 so
 I


think
 if
 we
 took
 obesity
 out
 of
 that


they'd
 be
 rising
 even
 faster
 because


cardiovascular
 risk
 will
 certainly
 be


reduced
 dramatically
 when
 we
 can
 use


these
 medicines
 at
 scale
 but
 people
 are


spending
 more
 time
 alone
 they're


spending
 more
 time
 in
 front
 of
 screens


we
 probably
 are
 not
 a
 healthier
 species


for
 being
 alone
 and
 in
 front
 of
 screens


and
 um
 particularly
 in
 young
 people
 we


have
 to
 worry
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 about
 this


trend
 um
 and
 even
 in
 the
 workplace
 We're


alone
 in
 in
 front
 of
 screens
 more
 and
 I


think
 that's
 a
 problem
 and
 we
 could
 talk


about
 the
 back
 to
 work
 kind
 of
 vibe


that's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 world
 now
 but
 um


I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 main
 reasons
 to
 do


that
 is
 to
 have
 a
 a
 mentally
 healthy


Workforce
 how
 would
 you
 describe
 the


corpa
 culture
 at
 El
 yeah
 we
 talked
 about


curiosity
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 core
 Hallmark


and
 as
 a
 scientifically
 driven


organization
 has
 been
 in
 our
 our
 ethos


for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 I
 think
 it
 is
 an


interesting
 place
 because
 we
 have
 also
 a


very
 high
 rigor
 standard
 on
 technical


matters
 but
 most
 people
 who
 come
 to
 work


here
 from
 other
 companies
 describe
 us
 as


very
 humanistic
 as
 well
 both
 in
 thinking


about
 the
 products
 we
 make
 which
 of


course


are
 in
 healthcare
 and
 that's
 a
 very


Human
 Experience
 but
 also
 with
 each


other
 I
 people
 talk
 about
 Lily
 nice
 you


know
 and
 I
 think
 we're
 a
 very
 um
 we
 have


a
 very
 high
 standard
 for
 being
 cordial


and
 respectful
 so
 how
 would
 I
 so
 how


would
 I
 how
 would
 I
 see
 that
 so
 now
 I'm


come
 to
 visit
 you
 and
 I
 walk
 around
 in


the
 corridors
 what's
 the
 kind
 of
 uh


what's
 the
 feeli
 well
 you
 might
 jump


into
 a
 meeting
 room
 and
 see
 people


vigorously
 debating
 uh
 data
 sets
 or


statistical
 analysis
 methods
 on


something
 or
 manufacturing
 output


numbers
 or
 a
 financial
 goal
 and
 at
 the


same
 time
 not
 raising
 their
 voices
 and


um
 in
 the
 weekends
 you
 know
 going
 to
 a


football
 match
 for
 their
 kids
 next
 to


each
 other
 because
 we're
 in
 a
 small
 City


so
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 cordiality
 what's


that's
 not
 perfect
 I'm
 not
 those
 are


very
 not
 those
 things
 to
 me
 make
 for
 a


great
 place
 to
 work
 but
 and
 I
 think
 it


it
 compels
 one
 important
 Advantage
 I


should
 talk
 about
 which
 is
 teamwork
 so
 I


think
 as
 company
 scale
 one
 of
 the
 most


um
 difficult
 things
 to
 fight
 is


bureaucracy
 and
 what
 is
 that
 at
 its
 core


it's
 the
 building
 up
 of
 systems
 and


processes
 that
 get
 in
 the
 way
 of
 the


work
 when
 they
 were
 designed
 to
 do
 the


work
 and
 here
 I
 think
 we
 have
 a
 good
 way


to
 cut
 through
 that
 which
 is


relationships
 both
 with
 the
 longevity


and
 tenure
 of
 our
 employees
 and
 this


feeling
 of
 it's
 okay
 to
 talk
 to
 anybody


you
 know
 on
 my
 way
 to
 this
 interview


seven
 or
 eight
 people
 talked
 to
 me
 in


the
 cafeteria
 when
 I
 picked
 up
 my
 cup
 of


coffee
 and
 just
 ask
 how
 my
 day
 was
 going


ask
 about
 a
 business
 matter
 Etc
 this


isn't
 a
 place
 where
 the
 CEO
 is
 like
 a


scary
 person
 you
 don't
 speak
 to
 and


neither
 is
 anyone
 else
 and
 I
 talk
 to


people
 like
 what
 are
 you
 working
 on
 and


how
 is
 that
 interesting
 it's
 it's
 good


that
 way
 but
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


cordal
 that
 sort
 of
 sense
 of
 respect
 and


openness
 can
 have
 is
 sometimes
 it
 can


just
 be
 a
 surface
 thing
 and
 that


sometimes
 conflict
 can
 be
 important
 to


produce
 new
 insights
 and
 results
 and


that's
 something
 in
 my
 tenure
 we've


tried
 to
 introduce
 in
 a
 structured
 way


is
 like
 can
 we
 have
 conflict
 and
 we
 do


it
 through
 little
 gimmicks
 like


appointing
 devil
 advocate
 in
 in
 meetings


and
 having
 um
 like
 one
 one
 of
 our
 most


important
 decisions
 Nikolai
 is
 when
 we


decide
 to
 go
 from
 phase
 to
 the
 middle


phase
 of
 development
 to
 phase
 three
 when


we
 do
 that
 you
 mentioned
 the
 $3
 billion


dollar
 two-thirds
 of
 that
 cost
 is
 the


last
 step
 so
 when
 we
 go
 we
 better


succeed
 and
 we
 actually
 have
 a


structured
 process
 where
 you
 assign
 a


team
 to
 be
 a
 contrarian
 to
 basically


defeat
 every
 argument
 the
 proponents
 are


making
 to
 advance
 and
 they
 write
 it
 down


and
 so
 decision
 makers
 are
 we
 force


ourselves
 to
 read
 that
 and
 consider
 the


alternate
 point
 of
 view
 but
 those
 are


newer
 things
 to
 us
 and
 I
 think
 in
 the


past
 um
 we've
 been
 I
 think
 too
 nice
 to


each
 other
 and
 made
 mistakes
 and
 it's


made
 us
 less
 productive
 what's
 the
 key


to
 fighting
 bureaucracy
 I
 think
 I


mentioned
 one
 I
 think
 relationships
 and


getting
 down
 to
 um
 making
 the
 or
 chart


and
 the
 process
 work
 for
 you
 not
 against


you
 and
 the
 way
 it
 can
 work
 against
 you


is
 people
 only
 go
 to
 those
 things
 right


in
 a
 way
 it
 should
 be
 the
 back
 up
 to


organic
 problem
 solving
 and
 uh


self-organization
 one
 of
 my
 habits
 is


when
 people
 escalate
 to
 me
 which
 they
 do


less
 and
 less
 uh
 over
 the
 years
 is
 I
 ask


them
 what
 they've
 done
 already
 to
 solve


the
 problem
 with
 their
 peer
 and
 often


people
 don't
 have
 a
 good
 answer
 to
 that


and
 I
 think
 in
 big
 companies
 leaders


like
 to
 problem
 solve
 it's
 probably
 how


we
 got
 our
 jobs
 right
 is
 we
 were
 the


best
 one
 at
 fixing
 things
 and
 in
 a
 way


leadership
 can
 be
 an
 amorphous


kind
 of
 challenging
 space
 to
 sit
 in
 and


I
 find
 myself
 I'm
 a
 Problem
 Solver
 I
 I
 I


kind
 of
 when
 people
 come
 to
 me
 like
 oh


this
 isn't
 working
 how
 do
 we
 fix
 it
 I


feel
 myself
 instinctively
 wanting
 to


help
 them
 but
 in
 a
 way
 that
 creates


bureaucracy
 if
 if
 things
 only
 get
 solved


when
 they
 go
 up
 that's
 a
 kind
 of


definition
 of
 hierarchical
 bureaucracy


so
 we
 have
 to
 fight
 against
 our
 own


impulses
 um
 and
 the
 the
 fact
 that


bureaucratic
 companies
 often
 the
 most


satisfied
 person
 is
 the
 leader
 of
 it
 not


the
 people
 in
 it
 and
 I
 think
 it
 should


be
 the
 reverse
 I
 think
 leaders
 should
 be


sort
 of
 worried
 about
 the
 chaos
 and
 the


less
 the
 organic
 nature
 of
 how
 things


are
 working
 maybe
 satisfied
 with
 the


results
 but
 a
 little
 uh
 concerned
 they


don't
 see
 and
 know
 everything
 I
 think


that
 would
 be
 a
 better
 state
 for
 me
 than


and
 the
 company
 than
 than
 knowing


everything
 and
 solving
 every
 problem


that
 surely
 will
 sub
 optimize
 lowly
 are


you
 a
 better
 leader
 now
 than
 when
 you


were
 younger
 oh
 yeah
 for
 for
 sure
 in


what
 way
 are
 you
 still
 young
 young
 and


all
 that
 but
 I
 mean
 in
 what


ways
 yeah
 I
 I
 I
 feel
 young
 but
 my
 kids


point
 out
 I'm
 not
 young
 um
 but
 I
 think


probably
 there's
 two
 steps
 in
 my
 career


that
 I'm
 sure
 many
 people
 at
 the
 top


organizations
 have
 come
 up
 against
 that


were
 really
 like
 aha
 moments
 the
 first


one
 is
 when
 you
 move
 from
 a
 version
 of


what
 I
 just
 spoke
 about
 being
 sort
 of


running
 a
 team
 being
 a
 manager
 we
 all


get
 to
 that
 but
 then
 you
 running
 the


management
 in
 a
 way
 where
 you're
 The
 Hub


and
 those
 the
 people
 are
 the
 spokes
 and


then
 you
 get
 to
 a
 job
 where
 the
 scale
 of


it
 no
 longer
 supports
 that
 where


basically
 you
 realize
 your
 job
 is


actually
 to
 help
 people
 sometimes
 the


managers
 underneath
 you
 sometimes
 the


people
 on
 the
 front
 line
 actually
 do
 the


work
 and
 create
 an
 environment
 where


they
 can
 be
 more
 successful
 and
 you
 need


to
 focus
 on
 like
 Clarity
 of
 what
 we're


the
 goals
 are
 not
 getting
 to
 the
 goals


themselves
 on
 Staffing
 the
 team
 with


people
 who
 can
 function
 at
 high
 level


together
 um
 not
 correcting
 their


individual
 behaviors
 um
 you
 know
 so
 to


me
 that
 happened
 when
 in
 my
 first


general
 manager
 assignment
 I
 was
 running


Canada
 which
 is
 a
 midsize
 market
 for
 us


and
 for
 the
 first
 year
 I
 tried
 to
 solve


every
 problem
 myself
 we
 missed
 our
 goals


most
 of
 my
 team
 was
 very
 frustrated
 with


me
 and
 I
 was
 frustrated
 with
 me
 and
 I


had
 a
 moment
 with
 one
 of
 my
 reports
 the


person
 running
 the
 sales
 group
 for
 me


and
 you
 know
 we
 we
 both
 like
 were
 doing


their
 end
 of-
 year
 review
 and
 we
 agreed


neither
 of
 us
 were
 successful
 and
 that


was
 like
 Epiphany
 for
 me
 is
 like
 I
 need


to
 make
 fundamental
 changes
 the
 second


one
 was
 when
 I
 got
 to
 the
 job
 before


this
 I
 was
 running
 a
 big
 part
 of
 Lily


and
 I
 realized
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 value


creation
 at
 Senior
 Management
 is
 outside


the
 company
 is
 really
 understanding


where
 your
 organization
 fits
 in
 the


world
 and
 being
 and
 and
 helping
 the


company
 refine
 its
 effort
 against
 that
 I


think
 inside
 people
 want
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 of


things


because
 they
 think
 they're
 good
 but


actually
 the
 world
 only
 values
 a
 few


things
 that
 you
 do
 and
 of
 course
 we
 have


to
 do
 many
 activities
 to
 to
 produce


those
 few
 things
 but
 lining
 up
 kind
 of


your
 wood
 behind
 one


Arrowhead
 is
 like
 a
 key
 Act
 of
 strategic


choice
 but
 is
 really
 only
 possible
 when


you're
 in
 a
 senior
 position
 and
 you
 need


to
 spend
 more
 time
 on
 that
 than
 you


think
 and
 it's
 frustrating
 because
 you


have
 to
 sift
 through
 a
 lot
 of


conversations
 that
 don't
 matter
 to
 get


to
 that
 but
 um
 you
 can
 form
 an
 opinion


about
 that
 and
 make
 a
 big
 difference
 if


you
 can
 really
 see
 how
 you
 can
 win
 and


produce
 value
 for
 customers
 and
 and


Society
 by
 focusing
 and
 I
 think
 that's


that's
 something
 else
 I've
 tried
 to
 take


into
 this
 job
 many
 of
 the
 things
 you


talked
 about
 involves
 um
 speed


um
 and
 kind
 of
 time
 schedules
 and
 so
 on


is
 speed
 a
 mindset
 yeah
 for
 sure
 how
 do


you
 work
 on
 it
 well
 it's
 a
 mindset
 for


leadership
 and
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 things


I
 embraced
 and
 talked
 to
 my
 team
 about


is
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we
 can
 affect
 as


Management
 in
 a
 complicated
 business


like
 ours


multi-disciplinary
 decade
 long


development
 Cycles
 highly
 regulated
 etc


etc
 etc
 the
 speed
 at
 which
 we
 choose
 to


move
 is
 is
 a
 choice
 of
 management
 it's


how
 what
 objectives
 we
 set
 the
 culture


we
 create
 are
 decision
 tolerance
 for


Perfection
 so
 we
 can
 make
 choic
 is


without
 Perfection
 those
 are
 all
 three


levels
 levers
 we
 can
 pull
 and
 go
 a


little
 bit
 faster
 and
 in
 many
 ways


companies
 that
 are
 seen
 as
 slow
 I
 would


say
 the
 first
 place
 we
 should
 look
 as
 is


at
 the
 leadership
 of
 the
 company
 um
 so


to
 me
 it's
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 lever
 you
 can


pull
 to
 create
 value
 that
 almost
 always


works
 and
 is
 mostly
 a
 function
 of


management
 changing
 things
 too
 fast
 can


be
 a
 danger
 um
 it's
 we
 talked
 about
 drug


development
 earlier
 and
 we
 we
 undertook


a
 four
 or
 fiveyear
 change
 management


process
 so
 we
 didn't
 break
 things
 as
 we


sped
 up
 that
 we
 did
 them
 we
 we
 we


changed
 our
 business
 process
 to
 develop


drugs
 in
 a
 methodical
 way
 but
 with
 a


goal
 on
 speed
 and
 importantly
 when
 we


did
 it
 we
 really
 focus
 the
 teams
 because


people
 can
 say
 okay
 we
 did
 have
 a
 goal


at
 the
 start
 to
 cut
 drug
 development


time
 in
 half
 and
 when
 we
 first
 announced


that
 the
 Lily
 teams
 looked
 at
 that
 and


said
 you
 guys
 are
 crazy
 we're
 going
 to


hurt
 people
 we're
 we're
 going
 to
 offend


Regulators
 we
 may
 never
 produce
 a
 new


drug
 again
 you
 know
 like
 this
 will
 break


things
 but
 interestingly
 what
 actually


changed
 I
 think
 it
 is
 important
 to
 have


those
 so-called
 you
 know
 hairy
 and


audacious
 goals
 um
 to
 really
 because
 if


you
 start
 with
 a
 10%
 goal
 you
 get
 to


eight
 or
 something
 you
 know
 so
 I
 think


if
 we
 really
 were
 going
 to
 get
 there
 we


needed
 something
 longterm
 but
 the


incremental
 change
 philosophy
 we
 adopted


was
 basically
 to
 beat
 the
 last
 time
 even


if
 it
 was
 just
 by
 1%
 so
 an
 example
 is


like
 it
 used
 to
 take
 us
 about
 half
 a


year
 from
 when
 we
 got
 a
 phase
 three


result
 to
 submit
 to
 the
 first


regulator
 and
 the
 last
 time
 we
 set
 a


record
 which
 was
 last
 year
 on
 on
 Zep


Bound
 for
 obesity
 um
 it
 was
 measured
 in


days
 so
 we
 compress
 that
 process
 by
 80


plus
 percent
 but
 we
 did
 not
 do
 it
 by


saying
 cut
 80%
 out
 of
 the
 process
 we
 we


did
 it
 over
 the
 course
 of
 four
 or
 five


years
 by
 saying
 the
 new
 goal
 for
 the


company


is
 the
 fastest
 the
 last
 team
 move
 that


the
 last
 team
 moved
 and
 so
 if
 someone
 if


it
 was
 180
 days
 if
 they
 did
 120
 that
 was


the
 new
 goal
 for
 everyone
 and
 then


people
 wanted
 to
 beat
 it
 because
 they


wanted
 to
 be
 the
 best
 and
 it
 created


this
 positive
 kind
 of
 always
 getting


better
 continuous
 Improvement
 mindset


that
 I
 think
 was
 super
 helpful
 and


driving
 change
 at
 scale
 uh
 in
 time
 very


interesting
 um
 quick
 question
 you
 uh
 you


mentioned
 um
 um
 you
 in
 the
 beginning


being
 about
 a
 CEO
 o
 than
 chair
 uh
 you


may
 know
 we
 Advocate
 that
 the
 chair
 and


the
 COO
 should
 not
 be
 the
 same
 person


why
 why
 do
 you
 think
 we
 are
 wrong
 on


that
 I
 think
 look
 I
 think
 there
 are


successful
 models
 successful
 companies


with
 both
 models
 I
 I
 don't
 prejudge
 um
 a


structure
 and
 some
 of
 it
 could
 be


contextual
 industry
 and
 person
 specific


actually
 I
 I
 know
 some
 CEOs
 who
 probably


shouldn't
 be
 chairs
 and
 some
 cosos
 who


should
 be
 chairs
 and
 not
 CEOs
 um
 I


believe
 in
 our
 sector
 because
 our
 time


Horizon
 is
 so
 long
 there
 are
 benefits
 in


uniting
 the
 role
 I
 think
 the
 the
 pure


you
 know
 the
 word
 chief
 executive


officer
 on
 execution
 is
 an
 important


role
 but
 marrying
 that
 to
 the
 long-term


agenda
 is
 particularly
 important
 it
 can


work
 and
 does
 work
 in
 many
 companies
 we


have
 many
 European
 peers
 where
 they
 have


the
 role
 divided
 and
 I
 know
 there's
 a


very
 tight
 linkage
 between
 the
 chair
 and


the
 CEO
 said
 that
 the
 execution
 agenda


is
 aligned
 to
 the
 long-term
 agenda
 but


as
 you
 know
 well
 from
 investing
 in
 many


companies
 probably
 on
 the
 list
 of


mistakes
 CEO
 chairs
 or
 CEOs
 can
 make
 is


sacrificing
 the
 shortterm
 for
 the
 long


term
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 particularly


true
 in
 a
 scien
 driven
 R&D
 intensive


industry
 like
 ours
 we're
 allocating


resources
 this
 year
 we'll
 later
 this


week
 announce
 our
 guidance
 on
 R&D
 spend


and
 we
 are
 solving
 for
 2035
 to


2040
 so
 I
 could
 easily
 drive
 earnings
 in


a
 very
 differentiated
 way
 by
 reducing


R&D
 spend
 over
 the
 long
 term
 and
 in
 that


period
 it's
 well
 beyond
 my
 tenure
 at
 the


company
 I
 won't
 be
 here
 in
 that
 period


of
 time
 but
 here
 I
 think
 uniting
 those


things
 helps
 solve
 that
 a
 little
 better


it
 saves
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 time
 and
 agenda


planning
 with
 the
 board
 and
 the
 downside


is
 you
 can
 end
 up
 with
 too
 much
 power
 in


one
 role
 and
 you
 need
 compensating


structures
 for
 that
 strong
 other


executive
 team
 members
 and
 a
 lead


independent
 director
 who
 has
 real
 Sway


in
 the
 boardroom
 we
 have
 those
 things
 um


a
 few
 personal
 questions
 at
 the
 end
 what


you
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning
 usually


between
 5:30
 and
 6
 yeah
 and
 what


depending
 on
 my
 time
 zone
 but
 at
 home


yeah
 what
 you
 I
 I
 typically
 do
 exercise


for
 30
 minutes
 um
 I
 try
 to
 mix
 that
 up


between
 uh
 getting
 my
 heart
 rate
 up
 or


just
 uh
 resistance
 and
 increasingly
 I've


added
 a
 lot
 of
 flexibility
 so
 I
 started


doing
 like
 yoga
 twice
 a
 week
 because
 I'm


getting
 older
 and
 I
 like
 to
 move
 most


all
 my
 hobbies
 involve
 being
 outside
 and


moving
 so
 um
 it'll
 be
 a
 sad
 day
 when
 I


can't
 do
 that
 I
 know
 that'll
 come


someday
 but
 I'm
 trying
 to
 prolong
 that


as
 long
 as
 possible
 it
 also
 clears
 my


mind
 and
 wakes
 me
 up
 a
 bit
 then
 I
 have
 a


cup
 of
 coffee
 and
 I
 read
 four
 papers
 and


apart
 from
 papers
 what
 do
 you
 read
 um
 I


read
 scientific
 journals
 as
 we
 talked


about
 I
 get
 typically
 like
 I'm
 a


Believer
 in
 like
 what
 you'd
 call
 T
 style


leadership
 so
 sort
 of
 running
 the


horizontal
 of
 your
 company
 but
 usually


once
 a
 qu
 one
 topic
 a
 quarter
 I
 try
 to


go
 pretty
 deep
 on
 like
 go
 down
 to
 the


the
 bare
 metal
 um
 and
 so
 um
 at
 the


moment
 I'm
 trying
 to
 learn
 a
 little
 bit


more
 about
 um
 some
 particular
 AI
 uh


features
 and
 so
 I
 was
 reading
 um
 and


playing
 around
 with
 some
 of
 the
 models


that
 are
 out
 there
 that
 that
 can
 affect


our
 industry
 um
 and
 I'll
 read
 about
 that


in
 the
 morning
 if
 I
 have
 time
 before


going
 to
 work
 after
 lately
 I've
 been


reading
 more
 papers
 because
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 news
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 happening


every
 night
 so
 uh
 trying
 to
 stay
 on
 top


of
 that
 but
 I
 will
 take
 time
 to
 read


read
 about
 a
 topic
 of
 interest
 to
 me
 you


read
 fiction
 only
 on


vacation
 I
 I
 wish
 I
 could
 read
 I
 enjoy


reading
 for
 pleasure
 but
 I
 find
 myself


tired
 of
 reading
 by
 the
 time
 I
 get
 home


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 evening
 I
 mostly


consume
 words
 for
 a
 living
 and
 uh


verbally
 and
 in
 writing
 and
 it's
 yeah


it's
 fatiguing
 so
 I'll
 tend
 to
 spend


time
 with
 my
 wife
 I
 go
 to
 bed
 early
 um


sometimes
 I'll
 do
 a
 little
 pre-work
 for


the
 next
 day
 and
 music
 yeah
 love
 all


kinds
 of
 music
 I
 have
 a
 eclectic


playlist
 um
 I
 grew
 up
 as
 a
 percussionist


playing
 drums
 in
 my
 my
 youth
 and
 I


enjoyed
 Jazz
 at
 the
 time
 so
 I
 I
 like


that
 when
 I'm
 actually
 and
 that's
 a
 type


of
 music
 I
 can
 listen
 to
 when
 I'm


working
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 distract
 me


as
 much
 um
 and
 I
 enjoy
 popular
 music
 and


other
 forums
 that's
 something
 I
 share


with
 my
 kids
 we
 have
 a
 a
 running
 family


playlist
 that
 people
 curate
 and
 you
 can


listen
 to
 at
 any
 time
 if
 you
 want
 the


latest
 thoughts
 from
 the
 family
 so


that's
 a
 fun
 way
 we
 stay
 connected
 our


kids
 are
 out
 of
 the
 house
 and
 it's
 a
 way


we
 can
 stay


you
 know
 in
 touch
 with
 each
 other's


preferences
 that's
 cool
 and
 um
 last


question
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 young


people
 uh
 yeah
 I
 think
 two
 things
 I


would
 say
 one
 is


um
 kids
 grow
 up
 today
 and
 I've
 watched


my
 kids
 grow
 up
 and
 you
 know
 impulses
 as


a
 parent
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 resources
 or
 to


control
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 and
 I
 think
 if
 I


compare
 that
 to
 how
 I
 grew
 up
 which
 was


very
 random
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 I
 had
 a
 lot


of
 latitude
 in
 free
 time
 I
 had
 my
 first


job
 at
 the
 of
 like
 11
 I
 was
 like
 a
 paper


boy
 and
 I
 ran
 a
 business
 cutting
 grass


and
 most
 days
 my
 parents
 had
 no
 idea


where
 I
 was
 until
 like
 dinner
 time
 and
 I


see
 just
 so
 much
 structure
 uh
 for
 our


children
 now
 and
 I
 I
 worry
 for
 them
 as


adults
 and
 when
 they
 come
 to
 the


workplace
 I
 think
 I
 see
 this
 pattern
 of


like
 let
 me
 plan
 out
 like
 what
 I'm


supposed
 to
 be
 doing
 and
 I
 encourage


young
 people
 to
 be
 open
 to
 opportunity


and
 open
 to
 surprise
 and
 uh
 to
 quick


Side
 Story
 But
 like
 you
 know
 I'm
 at
 Lily


29
 years
 almost
 now
 and
 I
 joined
 the


company
 for
 only
 one
 reason
 because
 my


wife
 was
 studying
 medicine
 at
 Indiana


University
 and
 I
 needed
 a
 job
 in


Indiana
 I
 I
 did
 not
 come
 here
 to
 be
 the


CEO
 or
 even
 come
 to
 the
 pharmaceutical


industry
 I
 just
 fell
 in
 love
 it
 with
 it


when
 I
 got
 here
 and
 I
 found
 I
 was
 good


at
 certain
 parts
 of
 it
 and
 and
 I
 think


I've
 done
 okay
 and
 and
 really
 enjoyed
 my


career
 and
 I
 think
 if
 we're
 so
 scripted


about
 things
 those
 those
 things
 will


never
 happen
 um
 so
 that's
 that's
 one


thing
 and
 this
 the
 second
 um
 is
 actually


about
 the
 inperson
 part
 is
 you
 know
 take


time
 to
 have
 lunch
 with
 different
 people


and
 learn
 about
 everything
 we
 do
 um
 I


think
 uh
 education
 and
 knowledge
 is


expanding
 at
 an
 exponential
 rate
 and


we're
 creating
 more
 experts
 through


schooling
 but
 fewer
 generalists
 and
 I


find
 joy
 in
 the
 generalist
 part
 uh
 in


the
 connecting
 the
 dots
 between


disciplines
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 important


for
 people
 to
 just
 in
 a
 company
 where
 we


have
 engineers
 and
 business
 people
 and


um
 and
 chemists
 and
 biologists
 there's


so
 much
 verticality
 to
 that
 it's


important
 to
 connect
 the
 parts
 well


these
 are
 great
 um
 pieces
 of
 advice
 I


would
 argue
 You'
 done
 way
 better
 than


okay
 you've
 been
 a
 huge
 success
 and


thank
 you
 wow
 your
 company
 has
 produced


some
 incredible
 things
 and
 well
 done
 for


staying
 Indiana
 that
 was
 for
 sure
 the


right
 choice
 me
 but
 big
 thanks
 for


joining
 us
 and
 uh
 please
 keep
 up
 the


good
 work
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 great
 to
 be


with
 you
 today
