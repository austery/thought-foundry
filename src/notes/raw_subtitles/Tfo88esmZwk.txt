Hi
 everybody,
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangen,
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sover
 and
 Wealth


Fund
 and
 in
 today
 we
 are
 in
 really
 good


company
 with
 Amanda
 Blanc,
 the
 CEO
 of


Britain's
 leading
 insurance
 company,


Aviva.
 Now
 this
 is
 the
 kind
 of
 company


that
 ensures
 your
 home,
 your
 car,
 and


helps
 you
 save
 for
 retirement.
 They


serve
 25
 million
 people
 globally
 and
 21


million
 people
 in
 the
 UK
 alone.
 Amanda


took
 over
 in
 July
 2020
 and
 has
 led
 what


is
 described
 as
 a
 complete


transformation
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 hear


all
 about
 it.
 Uh
 so
 Amanda,
 wonderful
 to


have
 you
 on
 the
 broadcast.


>> Now
 thanks
 Nikolai,
 really
 great
 to
 see


you.


>> Just
 briefly
 before
 we
 start,
 what
 does


Aviva
 actually
 do
 in
 short?
 All
 right.


In
 short,
 well,
 I
 mean,
 basically,
 it


protects
 people.
 It
 protects
 businesses


um
 from
 bad
 things
 that
 can
 happen.
 And


also,
 it
 looks
 after
 people
 in
 their


hour
 of
 need
 and
 when
 they
 want
 to
 do


things
 like
 retire.
 So,
 you
 know,
 we
 we


say
 with
 you
 today
 for
 a
 better


tomorrow.
 That's
 our
 purpose.
 And
 I


suppose
 that
 encapsulates
 everything


that
 we
 do.


>> Now,
 you're
 both
 an
 insurer
 and
 a
 major


investor.


How
 could
 you
 explain
 that
 dual
 role?


>> Yes.
 So,
 so
 obviously
 um
 as
 an
 insurer


we
 have
 a
 big
 balance
 sheet
 so
 over
 400


billion
 pounds
 and
 so
 we
 need
 to
 put


those
 assets
 to
 really
 really
 good
 use


and
 we
 do
 that
 by
 investing.
 We're
 a
 big


investor
 in
 the
 UK
 so
 you
 know
 we're


we're
 a
 big
 believer
 in
 the
 UK
 so
 we


invest
 in
 UK
 infrastructure
 in
 UK
 guilts


I
 mean
 also
 in
 private
 assets
 but
 we


also
 invest
 in
 in
 corporate
 debt
 and
 and


in
 other
 things.
 So
 I
 think
 it's
 about


getting
 the
 best
 return
 over
 a
 very
 long


period
 for
 our
 shareholders
 and


obviously
 also
 for
 our
 customers.


>> When
 you
 compare
 Aviva
 with
 other


insurance
 companies,
 what
 is
 it
 that


make
 you
 special?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 for
 for
 us,
 what
 makes
 us


special?


>> Apart
 apart,
 of
 course,
 from
 having
 a


wonderful
 CEO.


>> Oh
 no,
 no,
 no,
 no.
 But
 I
 I
 mean
 I
 think


it
 is
 about
 the
 people
 that
 work
 for


Aviva.
 They
 make
 a
 really
 big


difference.
 If
 you
 think
 about
 an


insurance
 company,
 it
 doesn't
 really


sell
 anything
 tangible
 like
 a
 handbag
 or


a
 pair
 of
 shoes.
 It
 basically
 sells
 a


promise
 to
 pay
 and
 so
 I
 think
 you
 know


that
 that
 makes
 us
 special
 but
 really
 if


you
 think
 about
 what's
 our
 USP
 it
 is


being
 diversified
 we
 will
 basically
 take


you
 from
 your
 junior
 savings
 account


your
 junior
 ISA
 at
 a
 very
 young
 age
 to


your
 equity
 release
 mortgage
 when
 you


know
 when
 you're
 thinking
 about
 your


later
 stages
 of
 your
 life
 and
 everything


in
 between
 and
 there
 are
 very
 very
 few


there
 are
 no
 insurers
 in
 the
 UK
 that
 do


that
 and
 there
 are
 very
 insure
 few


insurers
 now
 across
 the
 world
 that
 do


that


>> now
 you
 and
 I
 we've
 been
 in
 the
 jobs
 for


pretty
 much
 exactly
 the
 same
 time
 5


years
 now
 you've
 totally
 transformed


Aviva
 what
 are
 the
 key
 decisions
 that


you
 have
 made


>> so
 I
 think
 the
 key
 decisions
 came
 with


actually
 within
 the
 first
 month
 so
 I
 was


in
 the
 fortunate
 position
 of
 being
 on


the
 board
 for
 six
 months
 before
 I
 became


the
 CEO
 and
 really
 the
 the
 big
 decision


was
 around
 focusing
 the
 portfolio
 if
 I


looked
 at
 Aviva
 and
 you
 know
 we
 had


positions
 all
 across
 the
 world
 but
 we


didn't
 have
 scale
 positions
 and
 coming


from
 the
 background
 of
 working
 at
 for


much
 of
 my
 career
 working
 with
 h onre


dcast.
 You
 know,
 one
 of
 his
 big
 mantras


was
 you
 you
 need
 to
 be
 top
 three
 in
 the


market
 that
 you're
 in
 in
 a
 in
 order
 to


be
 able
 to
 influence
 and
 to
 get
 the


benefits
 of
 scale
 in
 that
 market.
 So,
 we


took
 decisions
 very
 early
 on
 about


focusing
 the
 portfolio.
 We
 sold
 eight


businesses
 for8
 billion
 pounds
 within


the
 first
 sort
 of
 12
 to
 24
 months
 and
 by


doing
 that
 we
 were
 able
 to
 meet
 our


second
 objective
 which
 is
 about


delevering
 the
 organization
 also


returning
 some
 money
 to
 shareholders
 and


actually
 what
 was
 good
 was
 by
 by
 selling


off
 those
 businesses
 where
 we
 didn't


have
 scale
 positions
 we
 basically
 showed


the
 strength
 of
 the
 core
 business
 in
 the


UK
 Ireland
 and
 Canada
 and
 and
 all
 you


know
 all
 the
 real
 benefits
 of
 being


scale
 players
 in
 our
 market
 really


started
 to
 shine
 M


>> Amanda,
 it's
 quite
 a
 luxury
 to
 be
 on
 the


board
 6
 months
 before
 you
 take
 over
 SEO.


So,
 were
 you
 sitting
 there
 with
 a
 piece


of
 paper?
 It's
 just
 like
 I'm
 going
 to


change
 this,
 I'm
 going
 to
 change
 that.


>> No,
 I
 mean,
 no,
 it
 it
 wasn't
 like
 it


wasn't
 like
 that
 at
 all.
 Um
 so
 I
 started


in
 the
 December
 2019
 and
 um
 obviously


then
 we
 went
 straight
 into
 into
 co
 and


the
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 we
 appointed
 a
 new


chair
 and
 and
 then
 you
 know
 that
 the
 CEO


stepped
 down
 and
 so
 there
 was
 a
 real


opportunity
 and
 of
 course
 as
 you're


sitting
 on
 the
 board
 you
 and
 as
 a
 pre


and
 I'd
 been
 an
 executive
 for
 a
 long


time
 before
 that
 you're
 always
 looking


at
 it
 with
 an
 angle
 of
 you
 know
 what


would
 I
 do
 what
 could
 I
 do
 differently


um
 and
 you
 know
 I
 really
 felt
 that
 by


making
 some
 real
 decisive
 decisions


around
 the
 portfolio
 that
 to
 me
 was


obvious,
 you
 know,
 everything
 in
 my
 DNA


was
 telling
 me
 that
 that
 was
 the
 right


thing
 to
 do.
 And
 then
 you
 saw
 the
 sort


of,
 you
 know,
 20
 20
 million
 customers
 or


probably
 wasn't
 as
 many
 at
 that
 point.


The
 real
 opportunity
 to
 sort
 of
 connect


all
 of
 the
 benefits
 through
 the
 customer


proposition
 and
 I
 felt
 that
 that
 was


something
 really
 compelling,
 but
 yet
 it


was
 it's
 always
 very
 frustrating,
 isn't


it,
 when
 you
 haven't
 got
 your
 hands
 on


something
 you
 want
 to
 sort
 of
 be
 able
 to


do.


>> What
 was
 the
 biggest
 challenge
 in
 this


transformation?
 Um
 so
 I
 I
 mean
 COVID
 was


a
 big
 challenge
 because
 obviously
 you


know
 effectively
 I
 was
 running
 the


operation
 where
 there
 were
 a
 few
 of
 us


in
 the
 our
 old
 building
 in
 St.
 Helens
 in


in
 in
 the
 city
 basically
 you
 know
 making


making
 decisions
 and
 using
 teams
 calls


and
 everything
 else.
 So
 that
 was
 a


blessing
 and
 a
 curse.
 I
 mean
 it
 was


difficult
 in
 that
 I
 like
 to
 be
 out
 in


the
 business.
 You
 like
 to
 see
 what's


going
 on
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 it
 also


meant
 you
 could
 really
 focus
 your


attention.
 You
 could
 really
 get
 things


done.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 was
 a
 challenge.


And
 then
 of
 course
 there's
 the
 culture


of
 the
 organization.
 Um
 you
 know
 pe


people
 were
 used
 it
 was
 quite
 slow
 in


terms
 of
 its
 decision
 making.
 So
 you


know
 there
 was
 sort
 of
 you
 know


increasing
 the
 pace.
 Um
 and
 then
 look
 I


think
 thirdly
 being
 absolutely
 honest


and
 by
 the
 way
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 a


shareholder
 uh
 in
 in
 Aviva.
 You
 know
 it


was
 it
 was
 the
 investor
 confidence.
 You


know
 when
 I
 was
 speaking
 to
 investors


they
 were
 basically
 saying
 really
 you


know
 Aviva's
 been
 a
 big
 disappointment.


um
 we've
 sort
 we've
 sort
 of
 had
 three


dividend
 cuts
 between
 2010
 and
 2020
 why


would
 we
 invest
 you
 know
 what
 you
 know


what's
 different
 and
 so
 it
 was
 really


you
 know
 m
 making
 sure
 that
 we
 were
 able


to
 tell
 that
 equity
 story


>> you
 know
 I
 I
 somehow
 think
 it's
 easy
 it


was
 easier
 to
 make
 change
 during
 covid


than
 if
 co
 hadn't
 been
 there
 because
 you


know
 people
 were
 not
 uh
 in
 the
 office


all
 the
 time
 they
 couldn't
 talk
 to
 all


their
 colleagues
 all
 the
 time
 and
 so
 in


terms
 of
 corporate
 culture
 I
 probably


think
 it
 was
 a
 bit
 easier
 to
 change
 but


>> well
 I
 I
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


untrue.
 I
 think
 that
 the
 problem
 was
 if


you're
 if
 you
 like
 to
 physically
 sort
 of


sit
 with
 people
 and
 listen
 to
 them
 and


understand
 what's
 going
 on,
 which
 I
 do.


Um
 I
 I
 had
 to
 find
 new
 ways
 of
 doing


that.
 So,
 you
 know,
 jumping
 into
 teams


calls,
 doing
 sort
 of
 virtual
 town
 halls,


getting
 a
 sense
 of
 the
 organization
 that


way.
 In
 a
 way,
 you
 had
 to
 trust
 a


different
 instinct.
 So
 I
 I
 do
 genuinely


think
 that
 in
 terms
 of
 decision
 making


co
 was
 definitely
 beneficial
 because
 you


could
 really
 just
 crack
 through
 things


particularly
 if
 you
 think
 about
 selling


businesses
 you
 know
 previously
 you'd


have
 had
 to
 jump
 on
 planes
 go
 and
 meet


people
 whereas
 this
 in
 this
 instance
 you


were
 basically
 having
 team
 meetings


moving
 on
 getting
 documents
 agreed


getting
 decisions
 taken
 that
 was


definitely
 easier.
 Talking
 about


decisions,
 you
 um
 bought
 direct
 line


for3.7
 billion
 pounds.
 Why
 was
 that


important
 for
 you
 to
 do?


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 think
 look
 when
 we
 looked
 at


our
 position
 in
 the
 UK
 we
 had
 scale


positions
 across
 you
 know
 most
 of
 our


product
 lines
 but
 we
 looked
 at
 the


opportunity
 as
 a
 customer
 focused


business
 for
 uh
 in
 in
 the
 retail
 home


and
 motor
 book
 and
 we
 really
 thought


actually
 when
 we
 looked
 at
 direct
 line


genuinely
 we
 felt
 that
 we
 could
 run
 that


business
 better
 because
 we
 had
 scale


because
 we
 had
 the
 ability
 to
 invest
 in


technology
 because
 we
 had
 the
 ability
 to


use
 digital
 and
 you
 know
 the
 the the
 AI


transformation
 that
 we'd
 already


undertaken,
 we
 could
 reuse
 that.
 We
 felt


that
 we
 actually
 could
 deliver
 a
 better


return
 for
 shareholders
 by
 running
 that


business
 um
 ourselves.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,


as
 as
 you
 would
 expect,
 we
 did
 look
 at
 a


number
 of
 other
 alternatives
 at
 the


time,
 but
 the
 actual
 benefits
 of
 the


expense
 synergies,
 the
 capital


synergies,
 and
 the
 customer
 benefits,


they
 sort
 of
 all
 came
 together
 and
 it


became
 a
 no-brainer
 really.
 And
 so,


yeah,
 last
 last
 November,
 December,
 um


we
 made
 the
 bid
 and
 and
 we
 completed
 the


deal
 in
 the
 1
 of
 July
 this
 year.
 M
 some


insurance
 companies
 focus
 in
 on
 one


product
 line
 whilst
 you
 cover
 the
 whole


spectrum.
 What
 are
 the
 advantages
 of


doing
 that?


>> So
 I
 think
 in
 2020
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 said


to
 me
 um
 you
 know
 a
 monoline
 businesses


are
 the
 way
 forward.
 You
 know


effectively
 Aviva
 is
 trying
 to
 do
 too


much
 diversified
 businesses
 you
 know


they
 they
 don't
 work
 anymore.
 I
 I
 felt


very
 differently
 from
 that.
 You
 know,


for
 for
 one
 thing,
 having
 all
 of
 the


customer
 data
 and
 having
 the
 customer


through
 their
 life
 cycle
 felt
 to
 me


important,
 but
 genuinely
 the


diversification
 benefits
 for
 capital
 are


significant
 when
 you
 have
 various
 lines


of
 business.
 And
 I
 think
 what
 we
 have


seen
 over
 the
 last
 five
 years
 is


diversified
 businesses
 have
 actually


done
 better.
 And
 if
 you
 think
 about


investment,
 so
 if
 we
 think
 about
 the


investment
 that
 will
 come
 with


generative
 AI,
 you
 know,
 being
 able
 to


spread
 that
 across
 20
 product
 lines
 and


not
 just
 have
 to
 invest
 it
 in
 one
 or
 two


definitely
 makes
 a
 big
 difference.
 So


you
 know,
 I
 I
 I
 think
 that
 people
 think


very
 differently
 today
 about
 diversified


businesses
 than
 they
 did
 maybe
 five


years
 ago.


>> Now
 you
 have
 experiences
 from
 other


insurance
 companies
 too,
 right?
 You've


been
 at
 Zurich
 and
 and
 AXA
 before
 Aviva.


What
 have
 you
 taken
 from
 those
 companies


into
 Aviva?
 So
 I
 think
 I
 mean
 you


definitely
 take
 something
 from
 every


organization
 that
 you
 work
 in.
 I
 mean


actually
 aviva
 is
 quite
 an
 emotional
 one


for
 me
 because
 I
 actually
 started
 in


commercial
 union
 which
 was
 a
 founding


company
 of
 Aviva.
 So
 you
 know
 in
 many


respects
 it's
 I
 ended
 it
 up
 in
 the
 same


company
 as
 I
 started
 with
 but
 I
 worked


for
 most
 of
 my
 career
 if
 if
 we
 count
 it


in
 year
 terms
 with
 AXA
 you
 know
 in
 two


for
 two
 different
 periods
 and
 I
 learned


a
 huge
 amount
 from
 that
 you
 know
 the


business
 the
 benefit
 of
 running
 a
 global


business
 a
 diversified
 business
 and
 I


think
 the
 opportunity
 to
 work
 with
 I


think
 what
 one
 one
 of
 the
 best
 leaders


which
 was
 on
 Dash
 I
 mean
 he
 certainly


was
 he
 transformed
 AXA
 you
 know
 he
 made


that
 into
 a
 really
 huge
 company
 and
 then


Thomas
 has
 obviously
 taken
 it
 from


strength
 to
 strength.
 But
 I
 think
 the


ability
 to
 work
 with
 great
 leaders
 to


understand,
 you
 know,
 what
 they
 do
 that


makes
 makes
 an
 organization
 great.
 I


think
 that
 that
 was
 that
 was
 really


important
 to
 me.


>> Do
 insurance
 companies
 attract
 a
 certain


type
 of
 people.


>> I
 don't
 mean
 that.


>> How
 should
 I
 put
 it?
 Uh
 people
 who
 just


put
 it
 just
 put
 it
 the
 way
 you
 want.


>> I
 mean
 people
 who
 study
 actuarial


sciences
 are
 not
 are
 not
 like
 what


should
 we
 say?
 uh
 you
 know
 uh
 rock
 and


roll
 type
 people
 are
 they


>> well
 I
 mean
 I
 look
 so
 what
 should
 I
 say


to
 that
 well
 first
 of
 all
 I'm
 a
 history


graduate
 so
 you
 know
 I
 mean
 so
 I
 think
 I


sort
 of
 break
 break
 the
 mold
 of
 that
 and


if
 I
 look
 around
 my
 exco
 we've
 got
 all


sorts
 of
 different
 people
 from
 with


different
 degrees
 talent
 I
 actually


think
 that
 people
 do
 not
 understand
 what


an
 insurance
 company
 does
 you
 know
 we


started
 off
 by
 talking
 about
 it
 but
 in


essence
 you
 can
 be
 in
 marketing
 you
 can


you
 can
 be
 an
 actury
 you
 can
 be
 an


accountant
 You
 can
 be
 in
 sales,
 you
 can


be
 in
 underwriting,
 you
 can
 be
 in


claims,
 you
 can
 be
 in
 supply
 chain.
 You


know,
 literally
 an
 insurance
 company


does
 everything.
 And
 so
 when
 I'm
 out


talking
 to
 school
 ch
 school
 kids
 about


insurance,
 you
 know,
 I
 say
 try
 to
 say


it's
 not
 about
 the
 motor
 insurance


adverts
 that
 you
 see
 on
 TV,
 there's
 a


huge
 amount
 more
 to
 it
 than
 that.
 And


when
 I
 look
 at
 the
 people
 at
 Aviva,
 you


know,
 they
 are
 they
 come
 from
 all


different
 backgrounds,
 different
 social


mobilities,
 but
 people
 are
 really


excited
 about
 insurance
 today.
 Nikolai,


I
 think
 because
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the


world
 that
 we're
 operating
 in,
 digital


and
 data,
 I
 mean,
 insurers
 have
 more


data
 probably
 than
 most
 other


organizations
 in
 the
 world.
 If
 we
 think


about,
 you
 know,
 somebody's
 pension,


somebody's
 home
 insurance,
 somebody's


car
 insurance,
 and
 then
 connecting
 all


of
 that
 data
 together,
 we're
 able
 to


attract
 really
 talented
 data
 scientists,


and
 then
 really
 talented
 digital
 people


who
 can
 sort
 of
 put
 that
 together
 in


propositions
 for
 customers.
 But
 do
 you


think
 people
 in
 Aviva
 are
 more
 like


people
 at
 Zurich
 and
 AXA
 than
 they
 are


uh
 compared
 to
 people
 in
 let's
 say
 uh


GSK,
 Diardio
 or
 BP?
 Um
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


mean
 look
 I
 think
 definitely
 insurance


is
 a
 different
 business.
 I
 think
 you're


not
 selling
 an
 actual
 physical
 product.


So
 you're
 not
 manufacturing
 anything
 I


in
 essence.
 So
 I
 think
 you
 do
 attract,


you
 know,
 there
 is
 more,
 I
 guess,
 um,


you
 see,
 you've
 got
 a
 lot
 more


intellectual
 power
 in
 that,
 you
 know,


you've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 really


need
 really
 need
 to
 think
 deeply,
 but


we've
 also
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 here
 who


really
 care
 passionately
 about


customers.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 no


different
 to
 people
 in
 GSK
 and
 and
 and


all
 and
 BP
 and
 all
 of
 those
 other


companies.
 Definitely
 the
 things
 we
 do


are
 different,
 but
 actually
 underneath


it,
 people
 are
 genuinely
 the
 same,


aren't
 they?
 you
 know,
 they
 come
 into


work,
 they
 want
 to
 do
 a
 great
 job
 for


their
 customers,
 for
 the
 organization


that
 they
 work
 in,
 and
 actually


sometimes
 I
 think
 we
 can
 sort
 of
 label


people
 that
 they
 are
 this
 type
 of
 person


or
 this
 type
 of
 person,
 but
 actually


they're
 they're
 really
 not
 underneath


it.
 They
 really
 just
 want
 to
 do
 a
 good


job.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 I
 share
 that
 uh
 I
 share
 that


positive
 attitude.
 Um
 what
 what
 are
 the


most
 important
 regulatory
 pressures
 you


are
 facing?
 What
 what what
 kind
 of


regulatory
 pressures
 are
 irritating
 you


a
 bit?
 Ah,
 so
 I
 mean
 it's
 really


interesting
 because
 obviously
 having


gone
 through
 um
 the
 direct
 line
 deal


this
 year,
 we've
 actually
 had
 huge


support
 from
 all
 of
 the
 regulatory


authorities.
 I
 mean
 look
 I
 know
 that
 you


don't
 hear
 CEOs
 saying
 that
 very
 often


but
 if
 we
 think
 about
 the
 P,
 the
 FCA,


the
 CMA,
 you
 know,
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get


those
 three
 approvals
 within
 six
 months,


you
 know,
 that
 was
 really
 quite
 an


achievement.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 showed
 some


of
 the
 regulatory
 um
 you
 know
 power


coming
 coming
 through
 or
 some
 of
 the


changes
 in
 the
 regulatory
 attitude


coming
 through.
 But
 look
 you
 know
 if
 I


think
 about
 the
 last
 number
 of
 years


we've
 had
 big
 changes
 in
 terms
 of
 our


solveny
 UK
 rules.
 You
 know
 this
 was
 the


postrexit
 eventually
 we
 get
 to
 what
 the


new
 solveny
 rules
 are.
 I
 think
 those


have
 been
 positive
 for
 insurance


companies
 from
 an
 FCA
 perspective
 the


sort
 of
 conduct
 regulator.
 I
 think
 we


have
 had
 some
 challenges.
 You
 know,


we've
 had
 challenges
 around
 new
 the


implementation
 of
 new
 consumer
 duty.


It's
 been,
 I
 think,
 a
 lot
 more
 expensive


than
 everybody
 thought
 it
 was
 going
 to


be.
 It's
 been
 a
 lot
 more
 bureaucratic


than
 everybody
 thought
 it
 was
 going
 to


be.
 But
 I
 think
 we're
 through
 the
 end
 of


that
 now.


>> Um,
 but
 I
 but
 I
 I
 do
 think
 that
 we've


definitely
 seen
 a
 change
 in
 attitude


from
 the
 regulator.
 some
 of
 the
 most


recent,
 you
 know,
 announcements
 around


encouraging
 people
 to
 take
 advice


because
 only
 9%
 of
 people
 in
 the
 UK


actually
 take
 advice
 when
 it
 comes
 to


their
 sort
 of
 retirement.
 You
 know,
 the


the
 regulator
 realizes
 that
 maybe
 some


of
 the
 previous
 things
 that
 they
 had


done
 had
 stopped
 people
 from
 taking


advice.
 We've
 now
 got
 more
 more
 rules


being
 consulted
 on
 that
 will
 help
 with


that.
 I
 I
 look
 I'm
 an
 optimist
 and
 I


feel
 that
 some
 of
 these
 changes
 are


going
 to
 make
 a
 positive
 difference
 for


customers
 and
 a
 positive
 difference
 for


you
 know
 the
 way
 that
 we
 operate
 the


business.


>> How
 do
 you
 read
 the
 health
 of
 the
 UK


consumer
 now?


>> So
 look
 I
 think
 the
 health
 of
 the
 UK


consumer
 if
 I
 think
 about
 our
 our


experience
 you
 know
 so
 we
 have
 a
 we
 have


the
 biggest
 wealth
 platform
 over
 200


billion
 pounds
 of
 the
 of
 of
 assets.
 So


we're
 a
 big
 workplace
 pension
 provider


and
 a
 and
 a
 big
 you
 know
 people
 save


onto
 the
 um
 the
 advisor
 platform.
 I


think
 for
 our
 customers
 they
 we
 have


seen
 really
 good
 resilience.
 I
 mean


there
 is
 also
 obviously
 the
 benefit
 that


insurance
 is
 the
 last
 thing
 that
 people


will
 sort
 of
 drop
 if
 they're
 in
 a
 sort


of
 um
 in
 a
 challenged
 environment
 but
 we


are
 not
 taking
 calls
 into
 the
 contact


center
 of
 people
 saying
 we
 can't
 afford


our
 insurance
 can
 you
 can
 you
 help
 us
 we


were
 during
 periods
 of
 of
 COVID
 seeing


some
 of
 that
 but
 we're
 not
 seeing
 that


today
 but
 I
 think
 that
 I
 think
 in


essence
 though
 what
 you
 know
 if
 we
 think


about
 our
 as
 you
 know
 we
 are
 mass
 market


you
 still
 have
 this
 issue
 in
 the
 UK
 that


there
 There
 are
 lots
 of
 people
 that
 you


know
 don't
 own
 cars
 that
 are
 in
 that
 are


in
 a
 desperate
 desperate
 situation
 and


we
 see
 that
 through
 the
 work
 that
 we
 do


in
 our
 social
 action.
 So
 the
 work
 that


we
 do
 with
 the
 citizens
 advice
 bureau


the
 cit
 the
 work
 that
 we
 do
 the
 money


with
 money
 advice
 service
 there
 what
 we


see
 is
 that
 people
 who
 don't
 save
 you


know
 who
 don't
 have
 money
 to
 save
 and


those
 people
 who
 don't
 save
 into
 a


pension
 they
 are
 struggling
 but
 they


have
 always
 been
 struggling
 and
 I
 think


you
 know
 what
 we're
 trying
 to
 do
 there


is
 to
 really
 help
 them
 to
 think
 about


how
 they
 can
 manage
 their
 lives.


>> How
 do
 you
 get
 people
 to
 save
 more
 for


retirement?
 Well,
 I
 think
 there's
 a


number
 of
 things.
 I
 think
 f
 first
 of


all,
 understanding
 in
 schools
 that


people
 need
 to
 understand
 that,
 you


know,
 you're
 today
 if
 you
 are
 going
 to


retire,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 a


defined
 benefit
 pension.
 You're
 only


going
 to
 have
 a
 defined
 contribution


pension.
 And
 in
 the
 UK,
 15
 million


people
 will
 not
 be
 able
 to
 retire
 well.


So,
 I
 think
 getting
 that
 education,
 it


needs
 to
 start
 young
 and
 then
 I
 think
 it


needs
 to
 carry
 on
 through
 um
 through


their
 working
 life.
 I
 think
 the


government
 can
 help
 with
 that.
 technical


eye
 if
 I
 think
 about
 you
 know
 things


like
 autoenrollment
 age
 bring
 the
 age


down
 from
 22
 to
 18
 where
 you
 start


saving
 and
 increase
 the
 contribution


from
 what
 it
 is
 today
 at
 8%
 to
 12%.


These
 are
 things
 that
 we
 know
 will
 make


a
 difference.
 Um,
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 a


combination
 of
 taking
 individual


responsibility,
 employers
 can
 help
 with


education,
 definitely,
 you
 know,
 the


government
 can
 help
 with
 policy.
 Um,
 so


I
 think
 it's
 a
 combination
 of
 all
 of


those
 things.
 And
 then
 I
 think


encouraging
 investors
 to
 think
 about
 not


just
 sort
 of
 taking
 the
 default
 pension


fund
 and
 just
 investing
 in
 the
 safest


assets,
 but
 thinking
 about
 investing
 in


things
 like
 private
 assets
 that
 over
 the


longer
 term
 will
 give
 a
 better
 return.


Moving
 on
 to
 some
 of
 the
 changes
 we're


seeing
 just
 now.
 How
 is
 AI
 changing
 the


insurance
 business?


>> Oh
 my
 gosh,
 massively.
 I
 mean,
 if
 I


think
 about
 Aviva,
 um,
 you
 know,
 we


we've
 got
 about
 150
 use
 cases
 on
 on
 AI.


I
 mean,
 look,
 we
 are
 very
 big
 users
 of


AI.
 So,
 if
 we
 think
 about
 our
 motor


pricing,
 we've
 been
 using
 AI
 for
 over
 10


years,
 machine
 learning,
 and
 like
 98%
 of


our
 retail
 products
 are
 priced
 using
 AI.


So
 for
 instance,
 if
 I'm
 18
 years
 old
 and


I
 buy
 a
 new
 Ferrari,
 I
 bet
 I
 pay
 a
 high


price,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 you
 you
 probably
 would


struggle
 to
 ensure
 that,
 Nikolai.
 I


think
 an
 18year-old
 driving
 a
 Ferrari,
 I


mean,
 is
 that
 really
 responsible?
 I


don't
 know,
 you
 know.
 Um,
 but
 yeah,
 I


mean,
 we
 we've
 been
 using
 all
 of
 data


and
 machine
 learning
 for
 a
 very
 very


long
 time.
 If
 you
 think
 about
 how
 how


competitive
 and
 dynamic
 the
 UK
 market


is,
 we
 we
 everybody's
 sort
 of
 constantly


using
 different
 models
 to
 get
 to
 your


best
 pricing
 point.
 But
 if
 I
 think
 about


some
 of the
 more
 exciting
 things,
 you


know,
 in
 our
 claims
 world,
 for
 example,


um,
 previously
 a
 customer
 would
 have


been
 on
 calling
 us
 to
 check
 where
 a


claim
 is
 in
 the
 process.
 They'd
 have
 got


through
 to
 a
 handler.
 A
 handler
 would


have
 taken
 details
 from
 them,
 looked


through
 all
 the
 screens
 of
 all
 the


different
 systems.
 Today
 we've
 we've


we've
 basically
 used
 AI
 models
 to
 basic


to
 to
 to
 predict
 the
 likely
 reason
 why


the
 customer
 is
 calling
 so
 that
 when
 the


customer
 gets
 through
 on
 the
 call
 they
 b


they're
 basically
 speaking
 to
 a
 handler


who
 can
 say
 I
 can
 see
 where
 you
 are
 in


the
 claims
 process.
 You
 know
 they've


done
 all
 the
 fraud
 checks
 using
 AI


models
 and
 they
 can
 basically
 help
 the


customer
 with
 the
 claim
 rather
 than


spending
 the
 first
 5
 10
 minutes
 of
 the


call
 taking
 all
 of
 the
 details.
 So
 I


think
 that
 that
 use
 case
 can
 apply
 to


very
 many
 products
 and
 so
 that


combination
 I
 think
 insurance
 is


perfectly
 set
 to
 take
 real
 advantage
 of


AI.


>> How
 is
 climate
 changing
 the
 insurance


business?


>> Well
 I
 mean
 look
 I
 think
 um
 I
 think


David
 Atenburgh
 has
 recently
 said


something
 that
 the
 climate
 is
 sending


out
 distress
 signals
 to
 to
 the
 world
 and


if
 we
 think
 about
 our
 business
 in
 Canada


last
 year
 we
 had
 you
 know
 six
 cat
 events


within
 about
 four
 weeks.
 cat
 event
 being


catastrophe,
 right?


>> Sorry,
 but
 being
 a
 catastrophe
 event.


Sorry,
 talking
 in
 my
 insurance
 job
 and


um
 good
 good
 that
 you
 knew.
 Fantastic.


Um
 you
 know,
 so
 so
 essentially
 you
 had


you
 had
 wildfires,
 you
 had
 hail
 storms,


you
 had
 flooding
 all
 within,
 you
 know,


the
 period
 of
 four
 weeks.
 So
 that


obviously
 affects
 insurers
 because
 we


have
 to
 price
 for
 that
 and
 we
 have
 to
 be


able
 to
 model
 that.
 We
 have
 to
 manage


our
 exposures
 and
 we
 have
 to
 really


think
 about
 the
 zones
 in
 which
 we
 can


underwrite
 and
 the
 capacity
 to
 which
 we


can
 underwite.
 So
 effectively
 it
 matters


a
 lot
 to
 us.
 Climate
 is
 really
 really


important
 to
 us
 and
 you
 know
 mitigating


some
 of
 that
 climate
 change
 is
 really


part
 of
 of
 what
 we
 do.
 And
 then
 if
 we


think
 of
 us
 as
 an
 investor
 we
 have
 you


know
 climate
 tech
 funds
 in
 our
 Aviva


investors
 business
 that's
 about
 offering


I
 guess
 investment
 to
 those
 companies.


We're
 trying
 to
 help
 with
 mitigating


that.
 So
 climate
 climate
 tech
 um


investments.
 So
 I
 think
 it
 matter
 it


matters
 a
 lot.


>> Yet
 politicians
 in
 part
 of
 the
 world


don't
 think
 it's
 happening.


>> No
 no
 I
 appreciate
 I
 appreciate
 that
 and


I
 appreciate
 also
 that
 you
 know
 maybe


the
 transition
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 a


different
 way
 than
 perhaps
 we


anticipated
 it
 would
 in
 2019
 2020
 when
 I


think
 everybody
 was
 incredibly
 gung-ho.


you
 know
 people
 were
 not
 driving,
 people


were
 not
 flying
 because
 of
 COVID
 and


therefore
 everybody
 thought
 the


transition
 was
 going
 to
 be
 extremely


quick
 right
 now.
 I
 think
 now
 we
 have
 a


different
 view.
 We
 have
 much
 more
 focus


on
 energy
 security.
 But
 irrespective
 the


transition
 will
 happen
 at
 some
 point.
 I


think
 the
 question
 is
 just
 when
 and
 the


question
 is
 ensuring
 that
 you
 know


companies,
 countries,
 businesses,
 people


do
 start
 thinking
 about
 how
 they
 can


mitigate
 some
 of
 the
 impacts
 of
 climate


change
 on
 them.
 I
 don't
 think
 that


changes


>> what
 are
 the
 type
 of
 risks
 you
 will
 you


will
 no
 longer
 insure


>> because
 because
 of
 the
 climate


>> well
 I
 think
 to
 some
 extent
 the
 UK
 has


struggled
 with
 flooding.
 So
 for
 example


um
 if
 we
 think
 about
 about
 flooding
 and


this
 was
 a
 10
 15
 year
 ago
 issue
 in
 the


UK
 lots
 and
 lots
 of
 flooding
 events
 and


people
 were
 finding
 that
 they
 could
 not


get
 insurance
 and
 that
 is
 because
 houses


were
 being
 built
 on
 flood
 planes
 or


being
 built
 in
 areas
 where
 biodiversity


had
 been
 sort
 of
 you
 know
 trees
 had
 been


taken
 away
 so
 rivers
 were
 flooding
 so
 so


I
 think
 that
 flooding
 is
 some
 of
 the


areas
 where
 we
 struggle
 in
 certain
 areas


because
 of
 the
 almost
 inevitability
 of


flooding
 happening
 to
 be
 able
 to
 ensure


that
 and
 you
 know
 so
 in
 the
 in
 in
 the
 UK


we
 have
 a
 scheme
 called
 flood
 which
 is
 a


sort
 of
 insurer
 governmentbacked
 scheme


to
 provide
 insurance
 for
 those
 areas
 but


not
 interestingly
 for
 houses
 built
 after


I
 can't
 remember
 the
 exact
 date
 I
 think


it's
 2001
 because
 then
 at
 that
 point
 it


was
 known
 so
 I
 think
 those
 are
 the
 areas


where
 you
 have
 to
 really
 think
 about


that
 and
 then
 you
 have
 to
 obviously


manage
 your
 exposure
 in
 other
 areas
 to


say
 you
 know
 for
 some
 risks
 you
 know


we're
 not
 going
 to
 insure
 the
 first


100,000
 if
 you
 think
 it's
 a
 business
 or


something
 like
 in
 certain
 areas
 is
 so


that
 customers
 take
 some
 of
 that
 risk


themselves.
 You
 know,
 I
 use
 always
 a


great
 example
 that
 when
 when
 I
 was
 um


working
 at
 AXA,
 there
 were
 quite
 a
 lot


of
 flooding
 events
 in
 the
 Cambria
 area.


We
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 customers
 there
 and


people
 would
 rebuild
 their
 houses
 and


they'd
 be
 rebuilding
 it,
 you
 know,
 their


kitchens
 for
 the
 third
 time,
 but
 they'd


still
 be
 putting
 in
 the
 wrong
 flooring,


they'd
 still
 be
 putting
 in
 wooden
 um


kitchen
 units
 and
 they'd
 still
 be


putting
 plug
 points
 down
 on
 the
 floor.


and
 you
 know
 you
 you'd
 say
 you
 have
 to


rebuild
 better
 and
 so
 that
 you
 can


recover
 more
 quickly
 and
 so
 I
 think


encouraging
 that
 is
 also
 really


important.


>> Moving
 on
 to
 leadership
 uh
 what
 is
 good


leadership
 to
 you?
 Um
 well
 f
 first
 of


all
 I
 think
 uh
 listening
 as
 much
 as


talking
 uh
 being
 able
 to
 communicate


really
 well
 uh
 quick
 and
 decisive


decision
 making
 but
 really
 importantly


good
 follow
 through
 on
 that
 decision


making


>> and
 what's
 the
 best
 way
 to
 follow


through
 because
 you
 you
 have
 been
 uh


some
 people
 call
 you
 the
 execution


queen.
 Um
 what
 does
 what
 is
 it
 what
 is


good
 follow-up
 and
 good
 execution
 imply?


How
 do
 you
 get
 there?


>> So,
 so
 many
 times
 you
 see
 um
 I
 I
 don't


know
 about
 you,
 you
 must
 see
 it
 all
 the


time.
 You
 hear
 leadership
 presentations


and
 you
 hear
 strategies
 and
 people
 say,


"I've
 got
 this
 great
 strategy."
 Um
 and


you
 look
 at
 the
 slides
 and
 you
 think,


"Yeah,
 that
 sounds
 really,
 really
 good."


And
 then,
 you
 know,
 you
 sort
 of
 look


back
 five
 years
 later
 and
 go,
 I
 wonder


what
 happened
 with
 that.
 You
 know,
 and


um
 and
 I
 I
 think
 strategy
 is
 great,


execution
 is
 better.
 Um,
 so
 you
 know
 I


think
 you
 can
 if
 you
 execute
 well
 on
 a


sort
 of
 80%
 there
 strategy
 you
 would


probably
 do
 better
 than
 you
 have
 you


have
 a
 100%
 brilliant
 strategy
 and
 don't


follow
 through
 on
 the
 execution.
 What


does
 it
 mean?
 It
 means
 you
 know
 having


very
 clear
 objectives
 for
 absolutely


everybody
 in
 the
 business
 from
 me
 to
 the


you
 know
 to
 every
 single
 person
 in
 the


contact
 center
 so
 that
 there's
 a
 real


flow
 through
 can
 everybody
 connect
 with


what
 the
 the
 principle
 and
 focus


objectives
 of
 the
 business
 are
 regular


monitoring
 of
 the
 performance.
 So,
 you


know,
 with
 with
 my
 CFO,
 Charlotte
 Jones,


I
 mean,
 she's
 phenomenal.
 You
 know,
 we


have
 great
 performance
 management


meetings
 with
 the
 business,
 regular


reviews.
 Are
 you
 doing
 what
 you
 said
 you


were
 going
 to
 do?
 If
 not,
 why?
 What
 has


changed?
 What
 do
 we
 need
 to
 do


differently
 to
 get
 to
 a
 better
 outcome?


I
 think
 that
 constant
 review,
 really


caring.
 So,
 I
 I
 talked
 to
 you
 about


customer.
 We
 say
 the
 customer
 is
 at


heart
 of
 the
 business.
 Are
 all
 the


actions
 therefore
 in
 the
 business
 around


the
 customer?
 We
 start
 every
 exco
 with
 a


with
 a
 with
 a
 you
 know
 complaint
 or
 a


compliment
 from
 customers.
 We
 do


customer
 closeness
 sessions
 listening
 to


our
 customers
 at
 an
 exco
 level
 at
 a


board
 level.
 So
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 making


sure
 that
 your
 actions
 match
 your
 words.


I
 mean
 it
 doesn't
 sound
 that
 difficult


and
 yet
 I
 see
 so
 many
 organizations
 that


don't
 do
 that.


>> How
 do
 you
 motivate
 people?


>> Well
 I
 think
 success
 is
 a
 big
 motivator


you
 know
 show
 showing
 them
 that
 in
 small


bits.
 So
 at
 the
 beginning
 in
 ter
 the


motivation
 at
 Aviva
 was
 basically
 giving


them
 the
 confidence
 that
 I
 believed
 that


we
 could
 do
 this
 and
 then
 by
 starting
 to


do
 some
 of
 the
 actions
 to
 show
 that


actually
 I
 was
 serious
 about
 this.


That's
 very
 motivating
 for
 people
 if


they
 see
 that
 they're
 working
 for
 an


organization
 that
 is
 doing
 what
 it
 said


it's
 going
 to
 do.
 That's
 highly


motivating.
 People
 care
 about
 customers


really
 focusing
 on
 that.
 People
 care


about
 leadership,
 their
 own
 development,


their
 own
 careers.
 Are
 we
 focused
 on


those
 things?
 are
 we
 taking
 them


seriously?
 And
 then
 really
 empathizing,


understanding
 the
 issues
 that
 they're


they're
 dealing
 with.
 If
 we
 think
 of,


you
 know,
 the
 contact
 centers,
 you'd


often
 go
 to
 the
 contact
 centers
 and
 and


you'd
 sit
 with
 people
 and
 they'd
 say,


you
 know,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 phone
 this


number,
 connect
 this
 call,
 nobody


answers,
 nobody
 listens.
 Actually
 taking


that
 problem
 away
 and
 solving
 it.


>> I
 think
 that's
 really,
 really
 motivating


for
 people.
 They
 think,
 "Oh,
 right.


Okay.
 We've
 got
 leaders
 who
 are
 going
 to


do
 what
 they
 say.
 That's
 great.
 I
 like


that."
 You
 had
 your
 first
 leadership


position
 when
 you
 were
 29.
 Now
 you
 are


more
 than
 29
 now.
 Uh
 h
 not
 much.
 What


the
 devil?


>> How
 has
 how
 has
 your
 leadership
 style


changed
 with
 age?


>> Oh,
 I
 think
 I
 I
 I'd
 like
 I
 use
 the


expression
 every
 day
 is
 a
 school
 day.


And
 I
 think
 your
 leadership
 style
 does


change.
 I
 mean
 there
 are
 things
 that
 are


the
 same
 that
 that
 ability
 to


communicate,
 that
 desire
 to
 communicate,


to
 simplify
 the
 story.
 I
 think
 that
 is


the
 same.
 But
 you
 learn
 so
 much
 you
 know


uh
 you
 learn
 so
 much
 about
 for
 example


you
 know
 the
 way
 you
 connect
 your
 te


select
 your
 teams
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 think
 at


the
 age
 of
 29
 you
 might
 take
 a
 little


longer
 to
 make
 a
 people
 decision
 even


though
 you
 sort
 of
 know
 the
 right


decision
 to
 make
 but
 you
 might
 take
 a


little
 bit
 longer
 today
 I
 think
 you
 have


to
 you
 trust
 your
 judgment
 a
 lot
 more


quickly
 you've
 seen
 the
 the
 movie
 run


before
 and
 you're
 like
 yeah
 I've
 seen


this
 movie
 run
 this
 movie
 doesn't
 end


well
 let's
 make
 a
 decision
 you
 know


early
 on
 I
 think
 Those
 are
 the
 things


you
 learn.
 And
 I
 think
 also
 that
 ability


to
 just
 step
 back.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 and


trust
 the
 team
 around
 you.
 You
 you
 you


are
 much
 I'm
 much
 more
 empowering
 today


than
 I
 would
 have
 been
 then.
 You
 know,
 I


think
 you
 can
 identify
 brilliant
 people.


You
 want
 brilliant
 people
 working
 for


you.
 You're
 not
 in
 any
 way
 threatened
 by


that
 and
 you
 just
 let
 them
 get
 on
 with


it.
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 different
 to


when
 you
 were
 29.
 You
 probably
 were
 a


you
 thought
 about
 it
 a
 little
 bit


differently
 then.
 You're
 also
 known
 for


your
 kind
 of
 direct
 communication
 style.


Now,
 it's
 not
 something
 we
 normally
 uh


think
 of
 when
 we
 think
 about
 uh
 you
 know


the
 UK
 where
 people
 are
 incredibly


polite
 and
 nice,
 right?
 So,
 how
 do
 you


how
 do
 you
 communicate
 in
 a
 direct


manner
 in
 a
 in
 a
 society
 when
 where
 it's


not
 very
 common?


>> But
 I
 think
 you
 can
 be
 I
 think
 you
 can


be
 nice
 and
 be
 direct.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 I


don't
 believe
 in
 being
 horrible.
 I
 I


mean
 I
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 you
 get


anywhere
 by
 being
 nasty
 or
 horrible.


Effectively,
 what
 you
 what
 when
 I
 give


feedback
 or
 when
 we
 are
 talking
 about


things
 here,
 I
 always
 say,
 you
 know,
 we


have
 to
 be
 honest,
 but
 we
 have
 to
 do
 it


in
 a
 nice
 way.
 So,
 be
 polite,
 do
 it


nicely,
 but
 be
 honest.
 There's
 no
 point


in
 pretending
 that
 something
 isn't
 an


issue
 if
 it
 is
 an
 issue.
 So
 I
 I


genuinely
 feel
 that
 you
 know
 when
 I
 I


have
 oneto
 ones
 with
 my
 team
 every
 month


and
 they
 have
 oneto
 ones
 with
 their
 team


and
 we
 are
 we
 are
 constantly
 saying
 okay


what
 did
 we
 do
 well
 and
 what
 could
 we
 do


better
 and
 I
 think
 in
 in
 framing
 the


conversation
 like
 that
 you
 know
 you


always
 know
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 you
 know


something
 something
 good
 but
 but
 but


also
 something
 where
 we
 can
 we
 can
 we


can
 work
 on
 our
 development
 for
 the


future.
 So,
 I
 think
 you
 can
 do
 it
 in
 a


nice
 way.
 You
 can
 do
 it
 with
 a
 smile
 on


your
 face.
 Um,
 you
 can
 you
 can
 but
 you


but
 you
 but
 you
 do
 honestly
 like
 if


you're
 running
 around
 the
 houses
 trying


to
 get
 a
 message
 through,
 it
 takes
 an


awful
 long
 time.
 It's
 very
 exhausting


and
 people
 don't
 understand
 and
 so
 they


definitely
 appreciate
 you
 being
 more


direct.


>> So,
 um,
 uh,
 personal
 reflections,
 you


are
 one
 of
 the
 CEOs
 who
 are
 the
 most


vocal
 about
 gender
 balance.
 Um,


why
 is
 that
 important
 for
 you?
 Well,
 I


mean
 I
 mean
 so
 first
 of
 all
 I
 would
 say


I
 was
 asked
 by
 the
 government
 to
 be
 the


women
 in
 finance
 champion
 in
 2020.


>> We
 are
 part
 of
 that
 movement
 in
 Norway


by
 the
 way
 and
 we
 we
 think
 it's
 great.


>> You
 are
 and
 now
 as
 far
 as
 the
 the
 women


in
 finance
 was
 concerned.
 What
 was
 clear


was
 that
 you
 know
 there
 was
 a
 that
 there


was
 a
 problem
 there
 is
 a
 problem
 with


women
 in
 financial
 services
 um
 in
 the
 UK


which
 the
 government
 actually
 actually


recognized
 about
 10
 years
 ago
 and
 set
 up


the
 women
 in
 finance
 charter
 and
 then


they
 you
 know
 obviously
 they
 have
 been


trying
 to
 improve
 the
 number
 of
 women
 in


financial
 services
 roles
 because
 the


belief
 is
 was
 that
 by
 having
 more


diversity
 around
 the
 table
 you
 get
 you


ultimately
 get
 better
 decisions.
 Now
 I


think
 about
 that
 that
 in
 diversity
 in


its
 broadest
 form
 but
 certainly
 you
 know


it
 def
 it
 will
 also
 apply
 to
 to
 gender


and
 so
 we've
 been
 working
 really
 really


hard
 with
 the
 government
 with
 other


financial
 services
 firms
 to
 broaden
 um


the
 the
 accessibility
 of
 insurance
 of


banking
 of
 investment
 banking
 to
 women


and
 it
 is
 by
 broadening
 that


accessibility
 I
 think
 that
 we
 can
 we
 can


bring
 um
 a
 more
 diverse
 workforce
 in


>> partly
 because
 of
 this
 work
 um
 you
 were


appointed
 at
 Dame
 in
 January
 4.
 And
 for


the
 uh
 listeners
 who
 don't
 know,
 it's
 uh


uh
 it's
 the
 um
 it's
 kind
 of
 the
 um
 the


equivalent
 of
 being
 knighted,
 right,
 for


um
 for
 women.
 Um
 and
 it's
 a
 huge
 thing,


right?
 Um


>> yes.


>> In
 in
 the
 in
 the
 English
 society,
 what


what
 did
 it
 mean
 for
 you
 personally?


>> Um
 well,
 first
 of
 all,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 was


born
 in
 the
 Ronda
 Valley
 in
 South
 Wales,


uh
 in
 the
 UK.
 My
 both
 of
 my
 grandparents


were
 minors.
 I
 went
 to
 a
 comprehensive


school
 um
 and
 I
 started
 at
 commercial


union
 as
 a
 graduate
 traininee
 not


knowing
 even
 really
 what
 insurance
 was


or
 thinking
 about
 it.
 So
 to
 end
 up
 with


a
 damehood
 um
 which
 actually
 was
 for


contributions
 to
 business
 for


contributions
 to
 climate
 and
 for


contributions
 to
 gender
 for
 those
 those


three
 things.
 I
 mean
 it
 went
 meant
 the


world
 to
 me
 obviously.
 It
 was
 a
 really


it
 was
 a
 really
 phenomenal
 um
 day
 for
 me


and
 my
 family
 and
 you
 know
 my
 mom
 and
 my


my
 you
 know
 my
 dad
 had
 passed
 away
 at


that
 point
 and
 and
 I
 I
 just
 know
 he


would
 have
 been
 so
 proud
 of
 that.
 Um
 but


to
 just
 think
 that
 you
 can
 come
 from


where
 I
 came
 from
 um
 you
 know
 to
 to
 that


was
 was
 just
 amazing.
 And
 um
 and
 I
 don't


take
 that
 for
 granted
 at
 all.
 And
 you


know
 and
 I
 do
 think
 that
 um
 you
 know


that
 that
 that
 you
 know
 for
 somebody


like
 me
 when
 I
 go
 out
 to
 schools
 and


speak
 to
 to
 the
 kids
 and
 I'll
 go
 back
 to


schools
 I
 do
 something
 called
 speakers


for
 schools.
 when
 I
 go
 back
 to
 schools


that
 like
 the
 school
 that
 I
 went
 to,
 you


know,
 for
 kids
 to
 be
 able
 to
 see
 that


it's
 you
 can
 make
 it
 in
 business,
 you


know,
 from
 the
 position
 that
 I
 came


from.
 I
 think
 that's
 really
 important,


too.
 I
 saw
 a
 piece
 of
 research
 once


which
 said
 that
 if
 you
 were
 kned
 or


appointed
 a
 dame
 uh
 the
 results
 of
 the


company
 uh
 deteriorated
 afterwards


because
 people
 thought
 more
 because


people
 thought
 more
 about
 society
 and
 uh


uh
 saw
 themselves
 a
 bit
 more
 as
 a
 state


person
 and
 therefore
 were
 more
 hesitant


for
 instance
 to
 lay
 off
 people.
 Do
 you


think
 there
 is
 a
 kernel
 of
 truth
 in


that?


>> No.
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 any


differently
 to
 how
 I
 thought
 before.
 I


mean
 I
 don't
 actually
 use
 the
 title
 in


the
 office
 uh
 or
 or
 at
 all.
 I
 mean
 I
 you


know
 I
 I
 it
 will
 get
 used
 if
 I
 go
 to


dinners
 by
 other
 by
 other
 people
 but
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 do
 that.
 If
 people
 call
 me


Dam
 Amanda
 I
 will
 say
 please
 don't
 call


me
 that.
 Call
 me
 Amanda
 that's
 my
 name.


Um
 and
 and
 I
 do
 think
 that
 you
 know
 it


hasn't
 one
 iota
 changed.
 If
 you
 look
 at


the
 performance
 of
 Aviva,
 you
 know,
 last


year,
 it
 was
 better
 than
 the
 performance


of
 Aviva
 the
 year
 before.
 And
 we
 will


continue
 to
 make
 the
 tough
 decisions
 as


we'll
 have
 to
 make
 as
 we
 go
 through
 the


integration
 of
 direct
 line
 and
 Aviva


over
 the
 coming
 months.
 You
 know,


decisions
 still
 need
 to
 be
 taken
 and
 it


hasn't
 in
 one
 way
 changed
 my
 my


approach.
 Now
 you
 um
 you
 often
 talk


about
 uh
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 are
 from


Wales
 and
 uh
 on
 this
 wonderful
 program


uh
 desert
 island.
 You
 even
 played
 the


national
 you
 know
 uh
 him


>> the
 Welsh
 national
 anthem.


>> Absolutely.
 What
 does
 it
 mean
 what
 does


it
 mean
 to
 be
 Welsh?


>> Uh
 I
 I
 mean
 I'm
 incredibly
 proud
 uh
 of


being
 Welsh.
 Um
 so
 you
 know
 Wales
 is
 a


very
 small
 country
 um
 you
 know
 34


million
 people.
 um
 which
 has
 actually
 if


I
 think
 about
 you
 know
 what
 has
 happened


to
 it
 you
 know
 there's
 been
 no


investment
 really
 mining
 was
 the
 key


industry
 and
 obviously
 the
 mines
 were


closed
 quite
 rightly
 um
 you
 know
 I
 mean


the
 way
 it
 was
 done
 was
 probably
 not
 the


way
 I
 would
 have
 done
 it
 but
 they
 they


were
 they
 were
 closed
 uh
 in
 the
 1980s


and
 and
 ne
 nothing
 ever
 replaced
 it
 and


so
 I
 think
 you
 know
 being
 Welsh
 and
 and


coming
 from
 that
 background
 that
 does


mean
 a
 lot
 to
 me
 I'm
 very
 very
 proud
 of


it
 um
 I
 mean
 obviously
 you
 very
 proud
 of


rugby,
 very
 proud
 of
 music,
 um
 the


things
 that
 Welsh
 people
 are
 very
 proud


of,
 but
 also
 proud
 of
 just
 the
 the
 era


that
 I
 came
 from.
 Um
 and
 my
 my


background,
 my
 you
 know,
 my
 what
 my


parents
 achieved
 and
 you
 know
 what
 what


my
 grandparents
 achieved.


>> Do
 you
 think
 it's
 a
 driving
 force
 in


you?
 I
 think
 the
 drive
 I
 think
 what
 is


the
 driving
 force
 is
 that
 coming
 from


that
 background
 and
 seeing
 what
 happened


to
 that
 community.
 Um
 and
 knowing
 that


nothing
 replaced
 the
 work
 that
 was
 taken


away
 there
 what
 there
 is
 always
 in
 me


that
 that
 will
 you
 know
 that
 I
 will
 I


will
 do
 better
 for
 myself
 um
 than
 than


that
 because
 I
 can
 um
 definitely
 that
 is


a
 driving
 force
 when
 I
 saw
 what
 was
 done


to
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 there
 and
 still
 today


you
 know
 my
 mom
 still
 lives
 in
 in
 the


Ronda
 Valley
 and
 I
 go
 back
 there


regularly
 and
 you
 see
 that
 it
 still
 has


not
 recovered
 that
 is
 definitely
 a


driving
 force.
 Yes.
 You
 played
 a
 lot
 of


instruments
 when
 you
 were
 younger.
 What


uh
 what
 what's
 the
 function
 of
 music
 in


your
 life?


>> Um
 all
 right.
 I
 mean,
 so
 I
 played
 the


piano
 and
 the
 clarinet
 and
 of
 course


like
 all
 good
 Welsh
 people,
 I
 sang
 in
 in


the
 local
 chapel
 and
 in
 the
 choir.
 I


think
 music
 is
 just
 it's
 a
 real
 escape.


Um
 I
 I
 love
 all
 sorts
 of
 music.
 You


know,
 yesterday
 I
 was
 listening
 to
 uh
 to


Chapel
 Rowan
 and
 Sabrina
 Carpenter.
 Then


I
 can
 be
 also
 listening
 to
 musicals.
 Um,


I'm
 going
 to
 see
 Hamilton
 on
 Friday.
 I


just
 I
 just
 think
 that
 music
 is
 really


it's
 really
 important
 to
 me.
 I
 I
 love


it.
 In
 many
 respects,
 it's
 a
 leveler.


Some
 of
 the
 most
 talented
 musicians
 um


and
 and
 you
 know,
 I
 just
 I
 have
 that


real
 gift,
 though
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 real


gift.
 I
 had
 to
 work
 hard
 at
 it.


>> But
 I
 really
 respect
 it
 as
 a
 talent
 that


people
 that
 people
 have.
 So,
 and
 there


was
 always
 music
 on
 in
 our
 house.


Always.
 You
 know,
 my
 mom
 even
 today,
 the


first
 thing
 she
 does
 when
 she
 gets
 up
 at


5:00
 in
 the
 morning
 is
 she
 will
 stick


on,
 you
 know,
 usually
 a
 bunch
 of
 opera


or
 or
 you
 know,
 music
 songs
 from
 the


musicals
 or
 whatever.
 She'll
 still
 be


have
 music
 on
 the
 whole
 day.


>> You
 have
 a
 social
 media
 channel
 about


your
 shoes.
 What
 is
 that
 about?


>> That
 was
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 me.
 I
 have


to
 say
 there
 was
 about
 10
 12
 years
 ago


and
 we
 had
 there's
 a
 insurance


conference
 in
 Manchester
 called
 Bieber


and
 um
 we
 we
 were
 on
 our
 way
 to
 this


conference
 and
 I
 like
 wearing
 different


types
 of
 shoes
 and
 one
 of
 my
 team
 when
 I


was
 at
 Access
 said
 I
 think
 we
 should


create
 a
 we
 should
 create
 um
 a
 social


media
 account
 for
 your
 shoes
 Amanda
 and


I
 was
 like
 oh
 right
 yeah
 okay
 next
 thing


I
 knew
 they
 had
 this
 account
 and
 it


would
 basically
 follow
 my
 shoes
 around


the
 conference
 you
 know
 the
 different


shoes
 and
 then
 of
 course
 it
 became
 a
 bit


of
 a
 thing
 um
 but
 yes
 It's
 uh
 it's
 just


a
 bit
 of
 fun.


>> Good.
 What
 do
 you
 read?


>> Um
 so
 look,
 I
 used
 to
 read
 loads
 and


loads
 of
 novels,
 business
 books.
 Today
 I


I'm
 more
 of
 a
 podcast
 listener,
 I
 have


to
 say,
 including
 your
 very
 own
 good


podcast.
 I
 must
 have
 listened
 now
 to


about
 15
 or
 20
 20
 of
 them.
 But
 I
 I
 think


that
 listening
 to
 the
 podcast,
 it's
 a


way
 of
 sort
 of,
 you
 know,
 finding
 out


what's
 going
 on.
 So
 rest
 is
 politics.
 Um


I
 I
 I
 I
 really
 like
 that
 where
 you're


sort
 of
 listening,
 you're
 listening
 to


the
 debates.
 Um
 at
 the
 at
 the
 same
 time


as
 you
 can
 sometimes
 be
 doing
 something


else.
 I
 can
 be
 on
 the
 treadmill
 or
 I
 can


be
 on
 my
 bike
 or
 doing
 something
 else.


So
 I
 think
 it's
 quite
 an
 efficient
 use


of
 time.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 really
 love
 that.


>> Lastly,
 we
 got
 um
 many
 thousand
 young


listeners.
 What
 is
 your
 best
 advice
 to


young
 people?


>> Well
 well
 first
 of
 all
 I
 think
 um
 build


up
 your
 resilience.
 I
 think
 it's
 tough


for
 young
 people
 today.
 If
 we
 think


about,
 you
 know,
 the
 environment
 in


which
 they're
 they're
 they're
 growing
 up


in
 social
 media,
 you
 know,
 the
 constant


feedback,
 um
 the,
 you
 know,
 whether
 it's


climate
 or
 the
 transition,
 the
 change
 in


workforce
 regenerative
 AI,
 I
 think


they're
 going
 to
 need
 to
 be
 really


resilient.
 So,
 they
 should
 really
 think


about
 things
 that
 they
 can
 do
 to
 build


their
 resilience.
 And
 then
 the
 second


thing
 I
 would
 say
 is
 like
 take
 the


opportunities
 that
 are
 given
 to
 you.


There's
 so
 many
 times
 that
 people


overthink
 things.
 You
 know,
 sometimes


things
 will
 work
 out
 and
 sometimes
 they


will
 not.
 But
 take
 opportunities
 because


you
 just
 never
 know
 where
 they're
 going


to
 end
 up.
 So
 whether
 that's
 at
 school,


go
 to
 different
 clubs,
 try
 singing,
 try


musical
 instruments,
 try
 different


sports,
 just
 take
 those
 real


opportunities
 and
 you
 just
 never
 know


what
 might
 happen.


>> Well,
 Amato,
 you're
 a
 wonderful
 example


of
 somebody
 who's
 taken
 all
 the


opportunities
 and
 really
 uh
 made
 so
 much


out
 of
 it.
 Uh
 it's
 been
 a
 real
 pleasure


talking
 to
 you.
 Very,
 very
 impressive.


Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you,
 Nikolai.
 Real
 pleasure


talking
 to
 you
 too.
 Thank
 you.


>> Thanks.
