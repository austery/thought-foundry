>> Since Canada officially
eliminated measles in 1998.
We've had outbreaks, but never
one like this. So how did this
outbreak get bad enough for us
to lose our elimination status,
and where did it come from?
Those questions took the Globe
and Mail's Nathan Vanderklippe
from Thailand to New Brunswick
to Texas. I sat down with
Nathan and immunologist
Dr. Dawn Bowdish to find out
what we can learn from tracing
the virus.
Dawn, thank you so much for
joining us in our temporary
studios, and Nathan, for
joining us on the line from
Spain. Dawn, it's been one year
since the measles broke out in
Canada, causing the country to
lose its measles elimination
status. It sounds like a pat on
the back for a lot of us that
that was something that that we
held. But break it down.
What does that actually mean?
>> Well, it means we're on a
list of countries that are torn
apart by war or that don't have
good public health, and none of
our G7 contemporaries are on
that list. It shows that there
were multiple systems that
broke down to have this happen,
and it also shows that we have
a lot of work to do, because if
we haven't been able to shut
down these outbreaks in a year,
it shows that we're going to
have to invest a lot in our
public health system so that
this stops and ends and doesn't
happen again.
>> I think I know the answer
to this, but avoidable.
>> Completely avoidable.
I mean, we had that that status
for almost 20 some odd years.
And and the only way to get out
of a measles outbreak is to
have everyone vaccinated.
It's just that contagious.
And every time a new baby is
born, we've got new vulnerable
people in our population.
So our focus is going to have
to be on getting those
vaccination rates back up
to get off that really
problematic list.
>> When we talk about
vaccination, let's be clear.
What is the the rate if someone
gets the vaccine, can they is
it 100%?
>> No, it's not 100%.
But as with most vaccines, if
you are vaccinated, it's thought
that it will modify the disease,
make it less severe. So, yes,
there are cases of adults who
got vaccinated a long time ago,
but most of the cases, over 90%
of the cases are in either
people who never were
vaccinated or people who were
only had one dose hadn't got
that second dose yet.
>> Nathan, you travelled
40,000 kilometres around the
world to track how measles got
to North America.
Before we get into where
you actually went,
my question is why?
>> Because as Dawn just
described, we're at a really
interesting and important
moment in public health for
Canada. And I think if you look
at some of the things that led
us to this moment in public
health, I think they are part
and parcel of some of the other
major developments that we have
in our society right now.
I don't know that what is
happening in public health is
is out of step with what's
happening in our politics.
And I think there's a there's
a lot of questions about why
that is and what is happening.
And it just felt like maybe in
this one particular instance, we
could find out how it happened.
And maybe in finding out how it
happened, maybe it helps us to
understand things just that
much better.
>> Dawn, before we get into
sort of Nathan's travel journey
to tell the story, is this
outbreak something that we can
come back from as a country and
as a province? Most recently,
Ontario just earlier this month
was clear of of measles sort of
cases. But we got to recent new
ones last week.
Can we come back from this?
>> Well, remember we were
living in a measles free
country for a long time.
But it takes resources and that
includes resourcing public
health. One of the challenges
with this outbreak is that
pockets of people are being
unvaccinated.
And those pockets of people,
for various complicated reasons,
are choosing not to get
vaccinated.
And they need people they can
trust to speak to them and help
them make those decisions.
We have to invest a lot of money
in making public health
accessible to those people as
well. There are major, major
structural issues that are
going to require major
governmental resources.
So, for example, in Ontario, our
chief medical officer just made
a case for having a vaccine
registry. I cannot tell you how
many people I've spoken to who
think they might have got
measles vaccinated,
maybe weren't sure.
>> The conversation earlier
with some colleagues about it.
Yeah.
>> How do you look it up?
You know, and if you've switched
family doctors, if you've moved
provinces, I mean, really what
would be helpful would make us
sort of comparable to the other
G7 countries, would be having
a national vaccine registry.
That's complicated because our
provinces administer our health
care. But I'd settle for a
provincial, you know, every
province having one of these.
So at least we would know where
people weren't vaccinated.
And at least people could be
proactive in getting vaccinated.
Of course, the other feature
that will require time and
effort is the family doctor
crisis. Childhood vaccines are
not given in pharmacies.
They're given in the family
doctor's clinic. And if you
don't have one, it becomes the
parent's job to somehow find
a public health clinic or find
a way for their kids to get
vaccinated. That's a lot of
work for working parents who
have a lot of other challenges
in this economy.
>> All right. Now that we've
established sort of where we
are right now, I want to go
back in time. Nathan 2020 4th
October. Where did this
outbreak begin here in Canada?
>> Well, we first heard about
this outbreak when we had
public health authorities in
New Brunswick. Describe a
couple of initial cases that
took place there. They put out
a warning. Warning. You know,
if you are at a local hospital
between this and this time,
perhaps you were exposed.
They said there was a large
family gathering, and then they
moved quite quickly to set up
a couple of pop up vaccination
clinics in rural New Brunswick.
From there, it took some time
for more information to come
out, but we learned eventually
from public health authorities
in Canada that there was a
measles case that had come on
a flight from Manilla, which is
what they said, Manilla and
into Canada and then across
Canada and to New Brunswick.
And then, of course, you know,
shortly after we had those
first case and cases in New
Brunswick, we started to see
a large number of cases in
Ontario as well. And from there,
if you track it, it sort of
there's you can we put it on
a map for, for our website.
And it's just little pinpricks
like fireworks coming up across
the continent.
As, as these cases spread.
>> I want to get a better
understanding of the the family
that you spoke with. The first
case in New Brunswick and also
the the hospital and the
doctors that were working with
them. How did they react when
they realised that they were
dealing with measles? As we
mentioned, it's been 20 plus
years. You know, perhaps some
doctors are not familiar with
seeing it. Perhaps it's
something in a textbook.
But how did they react?
>> Well, at first with
confusion, and I think that was
true for everyone who was
involved. Certainly in the
first few days, you had this
Canadian woman who who flew to
Canada from Asia, from Thailand,
as it turns out, not from not
from the Philippines. She began
to grow, feel unwell on the
flight, but she had an absolute
gruelling set of flights,
numerous legs of her flight
journey to Canada and thought,
well, listen, you know, it's
jet lag, it's I'm tired and,
you know, like anybody would be
with, with that many flights.
She takes an Advil.
She's coming home for her
sister's wedding. She's excited.
There's a delay.
She makes it the night before.
And so she gets up the morning
of the wedding.
She's not feeling well.
Her throat is sore, and.
But she pops an Advil and says,
you know, I'm gonna get through
this because she's crossed the
globe to attend her sister's
wedding.
And and then after the wedding,
she starts to feel unwell again.
And she goes to the hospital.
And the doctor who sees her
looks and she's.
She has a rash. She has a fever,
she has a sore throat. And and
if you're a doctor, you see
a lot of people with rashes,
fevers and sore throats,
and you see them with those for
very understandable reasons.
And so the first the first
diagnoses, the first guesses at
diagnoses were not the measles.
In fact, measles didn't come up
for several days, as best we
can understand. There was a
thought maybe since you're
coming from Southeast Asia,
maybe you have scarlet fever.
Maybe it's strep throat.
The woman's son had recently had
strep throat, and so they sent
her home with some antibiotics.
And so she actually went back
from the hospital on the day,
the day of the wedding,
and went back home for
a couple of days.
>> Dawn, I know we are coming
off the heels of Covid, but it
is still remarkable when when
Nathan's talking about, you
know, this map lighting up with
all the cases of how this all
started with really one person,
can you help us understand how
one person contact the virus
can turn a whole nation upside
down in terms of an outbreak.
>> Measles is the most
infectious, most contagious
virus we know of, the most
infectious. And so that means
that any pocket of
vulnerability, it's easy for it
to spread through. And again,
the fact that a lot of people,
there are pockets of people who
weren't vaccinated, so many
people who attended that
wedding weren't vaccinated.
And then they all travelled back
to their various home cities and
countries. And of course,
many of their friends and
neighbours weren't vaccinated.
And then those people travelled.
And so it speaks to two things.
The one is there is no way out
of this other than vaccination.
It is so contagious that
no amount of healthy living
or even the contact tracing
and all those things
that we have to do
can get us out of this
because it will just spread
faster than we have
the resources to stop it.
But it also shows how important
making sure that we have
consistent vaccination all over
the country. Because when there
are those pockets of people,
it's really, really easy for it
to spread. And of course,
humans don't stay still.
After we saw some of these small
communities in southwestern
Ontario, I remember my heart
and stomach dropping when I saw
that one of the exposure sites
was Ripley's Aquarium, a major
tourist centre in Toronto.
Right, because you know, anyone
who would have been there,
it would be impossible to trace.
All the people who were there
would now be vulnerable.
So this just really speaks to
the fact that there is no way
out other than vaccination.
>> Nathan from rural New
Brunswick. You end up in a
small Texan city population,
what, 7 or 8000 people?
Tell me how that journey began.
>> Well, I think anybody paying
attention in Canada and
certainly anybody involved in
public health in Canada would,
would obviously have noticed
all of these cases that that
emerged in Ontario. But but I
think where we started to get
a much larger international
spotlight on this outbreak was
when we started to get hundreds
of cases in Texas, and those
cases in Texas began to appear
at a really fractious political
moment as well. I mean, some of
the first cases were reported
there within days of Donald
Trump returning to the White
House. We had a whole new set
of people in positions of
authority in the United States.
We had we had a health
secretary who had a history of
of casting doubt on vaccines
and all the rest. And right at
that very moment, you had a,
you know, a major outbreak of
measles taking place in Texas,
which of course, is itself a
conservative state. And so, you
know, that that was when you
had CNN live trucks operating
in sort of this small town.
And that's when I think you got
a lot of attention on it.
And there were a number of
indicators that what had
happened in Texas had a link to
what had happened in Canada.
There were there were some
reporting on genotyping that
suggested we were looking at a
similar virus. But what I found
really interesting was that
nobody seemed to understand how
it got there. And and that was
true of people in public health.
That was true of doctors.
I spoke with the doctor who
treated the first case there.
She had no idea how it got
there. The local public health
officials had no clue how it
got there. They were like, well,
we think it came from Canada,
but we don't know for sure.
And so I was interested in
seeing whether it was possible
to to at least shed some light
on how it may have come all
the way to, you know,
far northwestern Texas,
from from Ontario.
And we're talking about places
that are thousands of kilometres
apart from each other.
>> Can you shed some light into
that? Why is it that federal
authorities and local
authorities had no idea?
>> Well, it wasn't for lack of
trying. I mean, they asked the
question, but we were we're
looking at and I think there's
this this is a really important
thing to bear in mind when you
think about what we're at with
measles right now. We are in
this very long and sometimes
very dark shadow of Covid and
and the experiences that people
had with Covid, particularly
around vaccines, around
mandates for vaccines, around
the impact that mandates for
vaccines had on the lives of
some who refused to have those
vaccines around. The contact
with the mechanisms of public
health, which I think can be
uncomfortable. Contact tracing
is uncomfortable. You know,
somebody from the government
calls and says, you know, where
have you been?
Who have you talked to that
that's uncomfortable.
And I think, you know, that was
fresh in people's minds.
And there was a sense that that
what had taken place around
Covid was destructive.
And so then the measles comes
and suddenly all of these
familiar and unwanted
mechanisms start to gear back
up again. Hi. I'm calling to
contact trace and people like,
no, sorry, I want nothing to do
with this. And that was the
answer for a lot of the public
health authorities in Texas.
Where did this come from? No, I
don't know don't want to talk.
And so there were not a lot of
answers that came out.
>> Don, that poses some
challenges for health officials.
How do you guys work to figure
out those gaps? But also I'm
also going to put in there, you
know, you talked a little bit
about sort of vulnerable
communities, but communities
that may have reservations,
whether it's cultural beliefs,
religious beliefs, simply
misinformation.
>> There's this mantra of
public health, which is, you
know, you have to go to where
the people are, and it's
helpful to have trusted leaders
in those spaces. So one of the
things we really need are
people who have extra training
about vaccines in general.
So there's lots of people who
have a blanket. No, but once
they have a trusted leader,
have that discussion with them
and sort of talk about risks
and benefits and ways that they
can understand. Most people
actually are movable. There's
very few people who are hard.
No, once they get the answers
to their questions. But I think
it's also really important to
understand that it's fine for
parents to have conversations
with their doctors about this.
There are very few things we
would expect people to just
blindly accept from their
doctor, and one of the
challenges in the vaccine space
is doctors don't often have a
lot of training in some of the
really nuanced questions.
You know, I'll just give you
an example. A colleague of mine
runs a vaccine hesitancy clinic
and got referred to a family
who wasn't getting their
measles vaccine. Turns out that
kid had a deadly egg allergy
and no one could tell
them. Was the measles vaccine
like the flu shot where it's
made in eggs? Right?
That is not an unreasonable
conversation to want to have.
So what would be incredibly
helpful if we had nurse
practitioners, doctors,
pharmacists, people who are
embedded in the community have
these training to have these
really advanced conversations
with people. And again, that
takes time and money and
political effort.
But that would be a big help in
getting over some of this
misinformation.
>> Nathan, knowing what you
know about how easily measles
can spread, do you think this
changes the broader attitudes
towards vaccinations?
>> So one of the interesting
things, because I asked people,
you know, were you vaccinated?
It wasn't the focus of my
reporting, but I was just kind
of curious because I was
curious about why not. And and
the answer I got more than
anything was not rooted in
conspiracy or some of the other
things that we tend to
associate with vaccine
hesitancy. For most people,
the answer was, well, isn't
the measles gone? Like, why
do we need to get vaccinated?
It just it felt like an
unnecessary medical intervention
for a disease that was
no longer with us.
And I think the corollary
to that was there are numbers
of people who thought, well,
listen, even if the measles
isn't gone, you know, like my
mom went through this, my
grandparents went through this.
They survived. They were fine.
And so there there was a I
think a and this is very human,
but but a forgetting of what
the seriousness of measles
could be. And I saw this in one
way, which was in Texas. People
spoke about some of the
symptoms of the measles, and
they were like, yeah. And this
was where actually things got
into conspiracy because people
were like, oh, you know, this
was an unusual strain of
measles. Something was wrong
here. People had hallucinations.
And other thing like that never
happened. You know, in my, my
parents and my grandparents had
it. Well, as it turns out,
it did. If you look in the
literature around measles, this
is one of the symptoms that can
be associated with measles.
But it's been forgotten because
the measles had been relegated
to the dust of time.
>> We are going to leave it
there, Nathan.
Dawn, really appreciate it.
Really insightful stuff.
Thank you so much.
>> Thank you.
