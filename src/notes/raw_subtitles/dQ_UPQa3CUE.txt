classical
 economics
 picture
 an
 economy


as
 a
 massive
 machine
 that
 runs
 best
 when


left
 alone
 this
 is
 the
 core
 idea
 behind


classical
 economics
 born
 in
 the
 18th


century
 when
 Adam
 Smith
 published
 The


Wealth
 of
 Nations
 in


1776
 Smith
 introduced
 us
 to
 the


Invisible
 Hand
 the
 idea
 that
 millions
 of


people
 each
 pursuing
 their
 own


self-interest
 unknowingly
 create
 order


in
 the
 economy
 when
 a
 baker
 bakes
 bread


they're
 not
 thinking
 about
 feeding


Society
 they're
 trying
 to
 make
 money
 yet


their
 pursuit
 of
 profit
 ensures
 people


get
 their
 daily
 bread
 classical


economists
 believe
 that
 prices
 wages
 and


markets
 naturally
 adjust
 themselves
 if


bread
 becomes
 too
 expensive
 bakers
 will


see
 an
 opportunity
 to
 make
 money
 more


Bakers
 enter
 the
 market
 increasing


Supply
 and
 bringing
 prices
 down
 if
 wages


in
 one
 industry
 are
 high
 workers
 flock


there
 until
 wages
 balance
 out
 this


school
 gave
 us
 David
 Ricardo
 theory
 of


comparative
 advantage
 the
 idea
 that


countries
 should
 produce
 what
 they're


best
 at
 relative
 to
 others
 England
 might


be
 better
 than
 Portugal
 at
 making
 both


wine
 and
 cloth
 but
 if
 england
 is
 much


better
 at
 cloth
 and
 only
 slightly
 better


at
 wine
 both
 countries
 benefit
 when


England
 focuses
 on
 cloth
 and
 Portugal
 on


wine
 the
 classical
 economists
 had
 one


major
 warning
 government
 interference


disrupts
 this
 natural
 order
 tariffs


price
 controls
 and
 heavy
 regulations
 are


like
 throwing
 a
 wrench
 into
 our
 economic


machine


their
 motto
 l
 a
 fair
 Let
 It
 Be
 marxian


economics
 if
 classical
 economics
 saw
 the


free
 market
 as
 a
 harmonious
 dance
 Karl


Mars
 saw
 it
 as
 a
 battlefield
 writing
 in


the
 midst
 of
 the
 Industrial
 Revolution


Marx
 wasn't
 just
 proposing
 an
 economic


theory
 he
 was
 diagnosing
 what
 he
 saw
 as


a
 fatal
 disease
 in
 capitalism
 at
 the


heart
 of
 marxian
 Economics
 is
 the
 labor


theory
 of
 value
 the
 idea
 that
 a


product's
 True
 Value
 comes
 from
 the


human
 labor
 put
 into
 making
 it
 picture
 a


worker
 in
 a
 factory
 making
 chairs
 in
 8


hours
 they
 might
 make
 10
 chairs
 that


sell
 for
 $50
 each
 their
 wage
 $80
 for
 the


day
 marks
 would
 ask
 if
 the
 worker


created
 $500
 worth
 of
 value
 why
 do
 they


only
 receive


$80
 the
 remaining
 $420
 is
 what
 he
 called


Surplus
 value
 essentially
 profit


extracted
 from
 the
 workers's
 labor
 this


leads
 to
 Marx's
 concept
 of


exploitation
 capitalists
 the
 factory


owners
 grow
 wealthy
 not
 through
 their


own
 work


but
 by
 pocketing
 this
 Surplus
 value
 Mark


saw
 this
 as
 an
 inherent
 feature
 of


capitalism
 not
 a
 bug
 like
 a
 pressure


cooker
 building
 steam
 he
 believed
 this


exploitation
 would
 eventually
 lead
 to


Revolution
 Marx
 introduced
 the
 idea
 of


historical
 materialism
 the
 notion
 that


economic
 systems
 naturally
 evolve


through
 stages
 just
 as
 feudalism
 gave


way
 to
 capitalism
 he
 predicted


capitalism
 would
 inevitably
 collapse


under
 its
 own
 contradictions
 leading
 to


socialism
 and
 eventually
 communism
 Game


Theory
 imagine
 economics
 as
 a
 giant


chess
 game
 where
 every
 move
 you
 make


depends
 on
 what
 you
 think
 others
 will
 do


that's
 game
 theory
 developed
 by
 John
 Von


Newman
 and
 later
 revolutionized
 by
 John


Nash
 yes
 the
 Beautiful
 Mind
 guy
 while


other
 economic
 theories
 try
 to
 predict


markets
 Game
 Theory
 asks
 a
 different


question
 how
 do
 people
 behave
 when
 their


success
 depends
 on
 others


choices
 let's
 start
 with
 the
 most
 famous


example
 the
 prisoners
 dilemma
 two


criminals
 are
 rested
 and
 separated
 each


has
 two
 choices
 stay
 silent
 or
 betray


their
 partner
 if
 both
 stay
 silent
 they


each
 get
 one
 year
 in
 prison
 if
 both


betray
 they
 each
 get
 three
 years
 but
 if


one
 betrays
 while
 the
 other
 stays
 silent


the
 betrayer
 goes
 free
 while
 their


partner
 gets
 5
 years
 the
 rational
 choice


is
 to
 betray
 but
 here's
 the
 twist
 if


both
 make
 this
 rational
 choice
 they
 end


up
 worse
 off
 than
 if
 they'd
 cooperated


this
 simple
 game
 explains
 everything


from
 arms
 races
 to
 price
 Wars
 to
 climate


change
 companies
 might
 all
 benefit
 from


keeping
 prices
 high
 but
 each
 has
 an


incentive
 to
 undercut
 the
 others


countries
 might
 benefit
 from
 reducing


carbon
 emissions
 but
 each
 has
 an


incentive
 to
 keep
 polluting
 While
 others


cut
 back
 it's
 the
 tragedy
 of
 rational


self-interest
 Nash's
 biggest


contribution
 was
 proving
 that
 in
 any


game
 there's
 at
 least
 one
 point
 where
 no


player
 can
 benefit
 by
 changing
 their


strategy
 alone
 the
 famous
 Nash


equilibrium
 think
 about
 traffic
 we
 all


drive
 on
 the
 right
 side
 in
 America
 not


because
 it's
 inherently
 better
 but


because
 everyone
 else
 does
 changing
 your


strategy
 alone
 would
 be
 disastrous
 Game


Theory
 isn't
 just
 academic
 it's


revolutionized
 business
 strategy


international
 relations
 and
 even
 biology


it's
 used
 to
 design
 auctions
 negotiate


treaties
 and
 understand
 everything
 from


dating
 markets
 to
 animal
 behavior
 it


shows
 us
 that
 sometimes
 the
 pursuit
 of


self-interest
 leads
 to
 everyone
 losing


neoclassical


economics
 in
 the
 late
 19th
 century


economists
 had
 a
 revelation
 what
 if
 we


stopped
 looking
 at
 the
 economy
 through


the
 lens
 of
 social
 classes
 and
 instead


focused
 on
 how
 individuals
 make
 choices


enter
 neoclassical
 economics
 which


revolutionized
 how
 we
 think
 about
 value


and
 price
 unlike
 classical
 or
 marxian


economists
 who
 thought
 value
 came
 from


labor
 neoclassicals
 introduced


marginalism


the
 idea
 that
 value
 comes
 from
 the


additional
 satisfaction
 you
 get
 from
 one


more
 unit
 of
 something
 think
 about


eating
 pizza
 the
 First
 Slice
 amazing
 the


fourth
 slice
 less
 exciting
 the
 eighth


slice
 you
 might
 even
 pay
 someone
 to
 take


it
 away
 this
 diminishing
 marginal


utility
 explains
 why
 water
 essential
 for


life
 is
 cheap
 while
 diamonds
 which
 we


can
 live
 without
 are
 expensive


neoclassicals
 view
 the
 economy
 as
 a
 comp


complex
 web
 of
 supply
 and
 demand
 curves


always
 seeking
 equilibrium
 they
 assume


people
 are
 rational
 actors
 who
 make


decisions
 to
 maximize
 their
 satisfaction


given
 their
 limited
 resources
 businesses


aim
 to
 maximize
 profits
 consumers
 aim
 to


maximize
 utility
 and
 prices
 act
 as


signals
 coordinating
 this
 elaborate


dance
 their
 model
 of
 perfect
 competition


envisions
 many
 small
 firms
 competing


with
 identical
 products
 complete


information
 and
 no
 barriers
 to
 country


while
 this
 rarely
 exists
 in
 reality
 it


serves
 as
 a
 benchmark
 for
 measuring


market
 efficiency
 and
 understanding
 how


prices
 are
 determined
 kenian
 economics


the
 Great
 Depression
 shattered
 the
 idea


that
 markets
 always
 fix
 themselves
 in


1936
 John
 Maynard
 KES
 stepped
 in
 with
 a


radical
 new
 vision
 sometimes
 the


Invisible
 Hand
 needs
 a
 push
 K's
 flipped


economic
 thinking
 on
 its
 head
 by


focusing
 on
 aggregate
 demand
 the
 total


spending
 in
 an
 economy
 his
 key
 Insight


during
 a
 recession
 people
 and
 businesses


get
 scared
 people
 save
 more
 businesses


invest
 less
 but
 here's
 the
 Paradox


what's
 smart
 for
 individuals
 becomes


disastrous
 for
 the
 economy
 when
 everyone


saves
 at
 once
 spending
 drops
 businesses


lay
 off
 workers
 those
 workers
 spend
 less


and
 the
 economy
 spirals
 downward
 this
 is


where
 canes
 said
 government
 must
 step
 in


if
 businesses
 won't
 invest
 and
 consumers


won't
 spend
 the
 government
 should
 fill


the
 Gap
 build
 Bridges
 hire
 workers
 cut


taxes
 do
 whatever
 it
 takes
 to
 get
 money


flowing
 again
 this
 spending
 creates
 a


multiplier
 effect
 when
 the
 government


hires
 a
 construction
 worker
 that
 worker


buys
 groceries
 the
 grocery
 store
 owner


buys
 new
 equipment
 and
 so
 on
 with
 each


dollar
 of
 government
 spending
 generating


more
 than
 a
 dollar
 of
 economic
 activity


K's
 most
 revolutionary
 idea
 in
 a


depression
 Thrift
 isn't
 a
 virtue
 it's


the
 problem
 to
 him
 trying
 to
 save
 your


way
 out
 of
 a
 recession
 was
 like
 trying


to
 lose
 weight
 by
 starving
 yourself
 it


might
 make
 sense
 individually
 but


collectively
 it's
 a
 recipe
 for
 disaster


supply
 side
 economics
 remember
 the
 1980s


when
 Reagan
 promised
 that
 tax
 cuts
 would


pay
 for
 themselves
 that's
 supply
 side


economics
 in
 action
 while
 Keynesian


focus
 on
 boosting
 demand
 Supply
 Siders


say
 we've
 got
 it
 backwards
 focus
 on


production
 and
 the
 rest
 will
 follow
 the


theory
 Rose
 to
 prominence
 during
 a
 time


of
 stagflation
 when
 the
 economy
 was
 both


stagnating
 and
 experiencing
 High


inflation
 something
 Keynesian
 economics


struggle
 to
 explain
 their
 big
 idea
 is


that
 high
 taxes
 and
 regulations


discourage
 people
 from
 producing
 cut


taxes
 especially
 on
 businesses
 and
 high


earners
 and
 you'll
 unleash
 a
 wave
 of


investment
 and
 work
 effort
 the
 economy


grows
 so
 much
 that
 government
 actually


collects
 more
 revenue
 from
 lower
 tax


rates
 this
 concept
 was
 famously


illustrated
 by
 Economist
 Arthur
 laugher


on
 a
 napkin
 creating
 what
 we
 now
 call


the
 laugher
 curve
 Supply
 Siders
 believe


in
 trickle
 down
 effects
 when
 the
 wealthy


get
 tax
 breaks
 they
 invest
 in
 new


businesses
 create
 jobs
 and
 boost
 wages


like
 water
 flowing
 downhill
 the
 benefits


eventually
 reach
 everyone
 they
 argue


that
 high
 marginal
 tax
 rates
 discourage


work
 and
 investment
 after
 all
 why
 work


harder
 if
 the
 government
 takes
 most
 of


your
 additional
 earnings
 but
 here's


where
 it
 gets
 controversial
 while
 supply


side
 policies
 led
 to
 economic
 boom


they
 also
 coincided
 with
 growing


deficits
 and
 inequality
 the
 1981
 tax


cuts
 didn't
 pay
 for
 themselves
 as


promised
 by
 1982
 Reagan
 had
 to
 raise


some
 taxes
 to
 combat
 growing
 deficits


critics
 say
 this
 proves
 the
 theory


doesn't
 work
 supporters
 argue
 taxes
 were


still
 too
 high
 and
 regulations
 too


burdensome
 supply
 side
 economics


fundamentally
 changed
 how
 we
 think
 about


taxes
 and
 growth
 today
 most
 economists


agree
 that
 tax
 rates
 matter
 for
 economic


behavior
 but
 debate
 the
 size
 of
 the


effect
 the
 theory
 remains
 influential
 in


political
 debates
 about
 tax
 policy


though
 often
 more
 as
 a
 political
 tool


than
 an
 economic
 Doctrine
 monetarism
 in


the
 1970s
 as
 inflation
 spiraled
 out
 of


control
 Milton
 Freedman
 and
 the
 monitor


interests
 emerged
 with
 a
 direct


challenge
 to
 Keynesian
 dominance
 their


message
 was
 simple
 the
 real
 problem


isn't
 managing
 demand
 it's
 managing


money
 to
 monitor
 interests
 inflation


isn't
 some
 mysterious
 Force
 it's
 pure


mathematics
 print
 too
 much
 money
 and


each
 dollar
 becomes
 worth
 less
 they


summed
 it
 up
 in
 one
 famous
 phrase


inflation
 is
 always
 and
 everywhere
 a


monetary
 phenomenon
 think
 of
 it
 like


adding
 water
 to
 soup
 the
 more
 you
 add


the
 less
 flavorful
 each
 spoonful
 becomes


fredman
 argued
 that
 government
 attempts


to
 fine-tune
 the
 economy
 often
 do
 more


harm
 than
 good
 there's
 a
 lag
 between


economic
 problems
 and
 policy
 responses


like
 trying
 to
 drive
 a
 car
 by
 looking
 in


the
 rearview
 mirror
 instead
 he
 advocated


for
 a
 simple
 rule
 increase
 the
 money

 by
 a
 small
 steady
 amount
 each


year
 no
 fancy

 no
 government

 sprees
 just

 predictable


monetary

 monitor
 interests
 also


introduced
 the
 concept
 of
 the
 natural


rate
 of
 unemployment
 a
 baseline
 level
 of


joblessness
 that's
 actually
 healthy
 for


the
 economy
 trying
 to
 push
 unemployment


below
 this
 natural
 rate
 through


government
 policy
 would
 only
 lead
 to


inflation
 not
 lasting
 Prosperity
 their


solution
 let
 markets
 work
 keep
 money


stable
 and
 get
 government
 out
 of
 the
 way

 isn't

 question
 it's
 about

of

 development
 economics


tackles
 this
 by
 looking
 Beyond

models
 of
 growth
 revealing
 that


Prosperity
 isn't
 just
 about
 capital
 and

 it's
 about
 the

 and

 that


shape

 development


economists
 identified
 something


Insidious
 called
 poverty
 y

 Vicious


Cycles
 where
 poverty
 itself
 prevents


growth
 imagine
 a

 too
 poor
 to
 buy

 with

 they
 can't

 now


multiply
 this
 across

if
 you're
 too

 to

 or

 you
 stay
 poor
 if
 your
 country

 it
 can't

 if

 is


widespread
 honest
 Behavior
 becomes


costly
 each

 reinforces

others
 but
 here's
 where
 it
 gets


interesting
 development
 economists
 found


that
 small

 interventions
 can


break
 these
 Cycles
 micro
 Finance


programs
 pioneered
 by
 muhamad

 to

also
 shattered

 myths
 about

 we
 used
 to
 think

countries
 just
 needed

 capital
 or


better

 but
 countries
 like


Argentina
 started

 fell

 started

 the

 Economic

about

were
 busy

the
 Austrian

 said
 we
 were
 missing


the
 Point
 founded
 by
 Carl
 manger
 and


developed
 by
 Scholars
 like
 Friedrich


Hayek
 and
 ludvig
 Von
 mises
 the
 austrians


insisted
 that
 economics
 isn't
 about


equations
 it's
 about
 Human
 Action
 their


most
 distinctive
 idea
 is
 their
 theory
 of


business
 Cycles
 unlike
 other
 economists


who
 blame
 recessions
 on
 insufficient


demand
 or
 monetary
 mishaps
 austrians


point
 the
 finger
 at
 central
 banks
 when


central
 banks
 keep
 interest
 rates


artificially
 low
 it's
 like
 giving
 the


economy
 a
 sugar
 Rush
 businesses
 embark


on
 ambitious

 thinking
 there's


more

 available
 than
 there
 really


is
 but
 eventually

 hits
 the

Rush
 ends

 fail
 and
 the

crashes
 the
 austrians
 are
 also
 famous


for
 their
 critique
 of

 that
 no
 Central

could

 enough
 information
 to

 about

 in

about

 their

 we're

 traditional
 economics


can't
 explain
 these
 behaviors
 but


behavioral
 economics
 can
 this
 school


introduced
 the
 concept
 of
 bounded


rationality
 we
 don't
 always
 make
 the


best
 decisions
 just
 ones
 that
 are
 good


enough
 we're
 influenced
 by
 how
 choices


are
 framed
 by
 what
 others
 are
 doing
 and


by
 our
 emotions
 ever
 notice
 how
 stores


Mark
 prices
 as


$999
 instead
 of
 $10
 or
 how
 hotels
 put


80%
 of
 guests
 reuse
 their
 towels
 signs


in


bathrooms
 that's
 behavioral
 economics
 at


work
 the
 implications
 are
 huge
 if
 people


aren't
 perfectly
 rational
 then
 markets


aren't
 perfectly
 efficient
 this
 opens


the
 door
 for
 nudges

 changes
 in


how

 can

culture
 create
 patterns
 that
 are
 hard
 to


change
 this
 school
 sees
 Economic


Development
 as
 more
 than
 just


accumulating
 Capital
 it's
 about
 building


better
 institutions
 from
 reliable
 courts


to
 functioning
 markets
 bad

can

 countries
 in

 good


ones

 what
 if


we

 the

 way
 we


analyze

 public

does
 exactly
 that

 our

Notions
 about
 democracy
 and
 public


service
 their
 key
 Insight
 politicians


and
 bureaucrats
 aren't
 selfless
 public


servants
 they're
 rational
 actors


pursuing
 their
 own
 interests
 just
 like


anyone
 else
 just
 as
 businesses
 seek


profits
 politicians
 seek
 votes
 and


bureaucrats
 seek
 larger
 budgets
 a


congressman

 a
 policy
 is
 bad


for
 the
 country
 but
 if
 it
 benefits
 their


District
 guess
 how
 they'll
 vote
 this


explains
 why
 good
 policies
 often
 fail
 to


pass
 while
 bad
 ones
 persist
 like
 zombies


that
 just
 won't
 die
 they
 identified
 a


crucial
 concept
 called
 concentrated


benefits
 and
 dispersed
 costs
 imagine
 a


sugar
 tariff
 that
 costs
 consumers
 $20


each
 per
 year
 but
 give
 sugar
 producers


an
 extra
 $20
 million
 the
 cost
 is
 spread


so
 thin
 that
 no
 individual
 consumer
 will


bother
 fighting
 it
 while
 producers
 will


Lobby
 hard
 to
 keep
 it
 this
 pattern


repeats
 everywhere
 from
 Farm
 subsidies


to
 trade
 restrictions
 it's
 why
 democracy


often
 produces
 policies
 that
 harm
 the


majority
 to
 benefit
 powerful
 minorities


public
 Choice
 theorists
 also
 expose
 the


myth
 of
 the
 public
 interest
 when
 a
 new


regulation
 appears
 we
 assume
 it's
 to


protect
 consumers

 dig
 deeper
