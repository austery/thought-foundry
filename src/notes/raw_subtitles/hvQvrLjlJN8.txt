[Music]


hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 so
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today


we
 are
 honored
 to
 welcome
 Kristoff
 fuk


the
 CEO
 of
 asml
 now
 asml
 it's
 the
 most


important
 company
 many
 of
 you
 have
 never


heard
 about
 it
 produces
 the
 equipment


that
 actually
 makes
 the
 computer
 chips


and
 it's
 basically
 the
 progress
 here


which
 drives
 and
 decides
 the
 speed
 of


the
 progress
 in
 health
 electrical


Vehicles
 communication
 weapons
 pretty


much
 everything
 we
 do
 so
 uh
 I
 can


consider
 Kristof
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 people
 in
 the
 world
 just
 now


warm
 welcome
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 Nikolai


it's
 very
 great
 pleasure
 to
 to
 be
 with


you
 today
 and
 uh
 I'm
 very
 much
 looking


forward
 to
 a
 great
 discussion
 about
 this


great
 industry
 and
 we
 are
 very
 proud


shareholders
 as
 well
 we
 own
 2.6%
 of
 the


company
 equivalent
 to
 $7
 billion
 so
 it's


very
 important
 for
 us
 now
 um
 Kristoff
 if


we
 kick
 off
 here


um
 what
 do
 you
 actually
 produce


well
 what
 we
 produce
 in
 ASL
 are
 a


lithography
 system
 lithography
 system


basically
 is
 a
 very
 important
 system
 in


the
 entire
 semiconductor
 process
 because


this
 is
 the
 system
 that
 is
 going
 to


print
 uh
 the
 image
 of
 the
 electronic


circuit
 you
 wants
 to
 get
 on
 a
 chip
 so


where
 if
 you
 want
 printing
 whatever
 uh


our
 customer
 wants
 to
 realize
 so
 this
 is


what
 we'
 have
 been
 doing
 for
 the
 last
 40


years
 pretty
 much
 now
 you
 are
 the
 only


euv
 liography
 printer
 in
 the
 world
 um


now
 in
 in
 one
 minute
 what
 is
 euv
 so
 euv


refers
 to
 uh
 the
 light
 the
 type
 of
 light


we
 are
 using
 basically
 on
 those


lithography
 machine
 euv
 mean
 extra
 tret


and
 this
 is
 a
 very
 very
 short
 wavelength


we're
 talking
 about
 13.5
 nanometers
 so


you
 look
 at
 a
 very
 very
 small
 wavelength


and
 in
 lithography
 the
 smaller
 the
 wav


length
 the
 smaller
 the
 feature
 you
 can


print
 so
 UV
 is
 the
 light
 and
 the
 reason


why
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 talk
 about
 euv
 is


because
 being
 able
 to
 create
 that
 light


in
 sufficient
 amount
 to
 industrialize
 a


tool
 with
 it
 has
 been
 a
 challenge
 of


many
 many
 years
 why
 is
 it
 so
 difficult


what
 what
 part
 of
 it
 is
 difficult
 well


two
 two
 part
 that
 are
 difficult
 the


first
 one
 is
 the
 the
 the
 light


generation
 what
 we
 we
 call
 The
 Source


you
 could
 see
 that
 if
 you
 want
 as
 the


light
 bulb
 you
 have
 in
 in
 your
 house


that
 create
 basically
 the
 energy
 you


will
 need
 to
 to
 expose
 basically
 a
 weer


and
 creating
 UV
 light
 in
 ey
 of
 power
 has


been
 a
 very
 very
 big
 headache
 uh
 for


many
 people
 and
 for
 many
 many
 years
 even


in
 ASL
 we
 spend
 more
 than
 20
 years
 uh


achieving
 basically
 200
 watt
 uh
 which


was
 we
 s
 the
 first
 threshold
 to
 make
 euv


economically
 viable
 now
 I'll
 tell
 you


how
 we
 do
 that
 because
 it
 will
 also
 uh


explain
 a
 bit
 the
 complexity
 so
 in
 order


to
 to
 create
 a
 euv
 light
 today
 on
 the


euv
 machine
 we
 have
 to
 hit
 a
 thin


droplet
 so
 it's
 a
 very
 very
 small


droplet
 of
 material
 with
 a
 very
 high


powerful
 CO2
 lasers
 and
 when
 we
 hit
 that


drop
 plate
 basically
 with
 a
 very
 high


powerful
 laser
 electrons
 start
 to
 go


from
 one
 place
 to
 the
 other
 and
 as
 they


do
 so
 you
 have
 the
 evv
 light
 creation


now
 to
 give
 you
 an
 idea
 uh
 we
 hit
 a


droplet
 50,000
 time
 per
 second
 and
 to
 be


honest
 I
 was
 simplifying
 a
 bit
 we
 don't


hit
 the
 droplet
 once
 we
 hit
 it
 three


times
 50,000
 time
 per
 seconds
 the
 first


time
 to
 make
 the
 droplet
 bigger
 the


second
 time
 to
 make
 it
 look
 a
 bit
 like
 a


gas
 and
 the
 third
 one
 to
 really
 get
 uh


the
 euv
 light
 out
 and
 of
 course
 being


able
 to
 create
 that
 technology
 to
 be


able
 to
 control
 that
 technology
 uh
 is
 a


major
 Challenge
 and
 that's
 what
 asml


spent
 about
 20
 years
 of
 R&D
 doing
 a
 few


years
 ago
 and
 you
 are
 pretty
 much
 the


only
 well
 you
 are
 the
 only
 company
 which


does
 this
 in
 the
 world
 well
 yes
 we
 are


the
 only
 company
 who
 who
 can
 do
 it
 I


will
 say
 in
 a
 way
 that
 can
 be


industrialized
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 of


course
 research
 uh
 Center
 that
 can


create
 UV
 light
 but
 not
 in
 this
 amount


uh
 and
 not
 I
 would
 say
 so
 systematically


I
 read
 somewhere
 that
 um
 your
 latest


machine
 is
 the
 size
 I
 mean
 it's
 not
 uh


it's
 not
 exactly
 pocket
 size
 uh
 it's
 the


size
 of
 a
 double
 deck
 of
 bus
 that's


right
 that's
 right
 and
 and
 I
 saw


somewhere
 that
 to
 transport
 this
 one


machine
 you
 needed
 seven
 planes
 and
 50


trucks
 yeah
 it's
 all
 correct
 and
 the
 the


size
 of
 the
 tool
 is
 is
 uh
 related
 to
 the


second
 biggest
 uh
 challenge
 we
 have
 on


UV
 which
 is
 the
 optic
 itself
 because


once
 you
 have
 the
 light
 you
 need
 to
 be


able
 to
 guide
 the
 light
 first
 to
 the


reticle
 to
 take
 the
 image
 you
 want
 to


print
 on
 the
 waer
 and
 then
 to
 the
 weer


to
 print
 it
 and
 in
 order
 to
 do
 that
 you


need
 to
 work
 in
 vacuum
 you
 need
 to


develop
 very
 complex
 material
 I
 won't


share
 what
 they
 are
 for
 obvious
 reason
 H


and
 that's
 also
 something
 that
 together


with
 Ze
 our
 partner
 this
 time
 we
 also


spend
 many
 many
 years
 to
 bring
 together


so
 you
 could
 see
 euv
 as
 a
 double


challenge
 the
 source
 and
 the
 optic
 and


the
 rest
 you
 know
 you
 could
 say
 is
 is


pretty
 much
 looking
 like
 a
 normal


scanner
 so
 you
 basically
 need
 this
 to


make
 um
 the
 chip
 smaller
 and
 smaller
 and


which
 kind
 of
 brings
 us
 to
 more
 law
 what


what
 uh
 just
 briefly
 could
 you
 explain


more
 slow
 well
 I
 think
 you
 have
 many


many
 version
 of
 more
 slow
 uh
 if
 you


listen
 to
 people
 and
 that's
 one
 of
 the


reason
 some
 uh
 some
 people
 tell
 you
 Moro


is
 dead
 or
 has
 died
 already
 many
 years


ago
 the
 version
 of
 Moro
 I
 like
 is
 the


one
 that
 said
 that
 you
 have
 to
 double


the
 density
 of
 transistor
 on
 a
 ship


every
 two
 years
 uh
 and
 that's
 a
 load


that
 have
 been
 executed
 and
 is
 still


being
 executed
 it's
 something
 that
 logic


customer
 are
 doing
 company
 like
 Intel


tsmc
 Samsung
 it's
 also
 a
 load
 that
 dram


uh
 customer
 are
 are
 following
 and
 that


need
 to
 double
 the
 transistor
 density


every
 two
 years
 is
 key
 basically
 to


deliver
 performance
 to
 deliver
 today
 AI


for
 example
 we
 have
 ai
 today
 because
 we


have
 gone
 far
 enough
 on
 Mor
 low
 so
 that


we
 have
 enough
 basically
 computing
 power


to
 start
 to
 Trend
 the
 type
 of
 model
 AI


is
 looking
 at
 and
 how
 much
 longer
 can


this
 development
 continue
 you
 think
 well


so
 here
 if
 you
 look
 at
 uh
 in
 fact
 uh


that
 low
 recently
 this
 this
 has
 in
 fact


accelerated
 because
 AI
 has
 demanded
 even


more
 so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 a
 a
 i
 people
 who


do
 AI
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 double
 the


density
 of
 transistor
 every
 two
 years


right
 now
 they
 want
 to
 multiply
 it
 by
 a


factor
 of
 16
 every
 two
 years
 so
 this
 is


the
 type
 of
 new
 low
 you're
 looking
 at


when
 it
 comes
 to
 Computing
 performance


High
 Computing
 performance
 for
 AI
 so
 you


see
 in
 fact
 in
 this
 case
 a
 strong
 uh


acceleration
 of
 the
 performance
 uh
 need


uh
 and
 demand
 so
 you
 know
 you
 could
 say


it's
 getting
 of
 of
 course
 may
 be
 harder


over
 time
 to
 to
 get
 this
 density
 uh
 but


so
 far
 people
 have
 been
 creative
 enough


to
 to
 keep
 going
 and
 I
 think
 we
 continue


to
 see
 that
 so
 the
 question
 when
 does
 it


stop
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 could
 say
 never
 uh
 if


I'm
 a
 bit
 less
 uh
 bullish
 I
 would
 say


won't
 stop
 at
 least
 for
 another
 20
 years


and
 we'll
 see
 after
 that
 but
 I
 think


this
 this
 is
 still
 a
 longterm
 enough


view
 so
 I
 think
 we
 we
 believe
 that
 the


the
 level
 of
 creativity
 in
 this
 industry


far
 beyond
 just
 SML
 by
 the
 way
 is
 such


that
 uh
 we
 will
 keep
 going
 for
 for
 quite


a
 long
 time
 I'm
 sorry
 just
 to
 to
 get


that
 straight
 you
 think
 you
 can
 increase


uh
 complexity
 by
 16
 times
 every
 two


years
 for
 the
 next
 20
 years
 wow
 this
 is


what
 our
 AI
 uh
 you
 know
 uh
 uh
 people


want
 right
 this
 is
 what
 the
 AI
 company


wants
 now
 the
 problem
 with
 that
 today
 is


that
 if
 we
 were
 to
 go
 on
 this
 pass
 uh


cost
 is
 an
 issue
 and
 as
 you
 know
 of


course
 energy
 consumption
 is
 an
 issue
 so


that
 demand
 has
 to
 be
 I
 would
 say


fulfilled
 through
 major
 innovation
 in


our
 industry
 major
 innovation
 in
 logic


you
 know
 again
 Intel
 tsmc
 Samsung
 in


memory
 so
 you
 hear
 a
 lot
 about
 high
 band


WS
 memory
 today
 but
 also
 major


innovation
 in
 our
 domain
 in
 lithography


to
 continue
 to
 basically
 enable
 our


customer
 to
 to
 get
 uh
 that
 type
 of


density
 this
 is
 why
 you
 know
 you
 talked


about
 our
 uh
 uh
 latest
 equipment
 before


but
 this
 is
 why
 we
 continue
 basically
 to


to
 innovate
 and
 and
 and
 bring
 basically


the
 ability
 to
 to
 get
 more
 and
 more


transistor
 uh
 per
 unit
 area
 with
 better


lithography
 machine
 how
 far
 into
 the


future
 can
 you
 see
 well
 usually
 we
 have


a
 a
 good
 view
 of
 the
 next
 five
 years
 I


think
 I
 would
 say
 you
 know
 the
 five


years
 coming
 I
 would
 call
 it
 uh
 the
 plan


I
 think
 we
 have
 a
 pretty
 good
 uh
 idea
 of


what
 could
 happen
 in
 the
 next
 10
 years


maybe
 15
 years
 but
 then
 you
 start
 to


look
 at
 scenarios
 so
 you
 know
 there
 is


many
 options
 to
 get
 there
 and
 after
 that


it's
 a
 bit
 more
 theoretical
 but
 I
 would


say
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 next
 5
 to
 15


years
 um
 there's
 quite
 some
 um


confidence
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 the


continuation
 of
 mlow
 the
 continuation
 of


this
 industry
 is
 is
 pretty
 strong
 with
 a


lot
 of
 challenges
 of
 course
 uh
 but


that's
 always
 been
 true
 when
 we
 talk


about
 uh
 two
 nanometer
 chips
 how
 how


small
 is
 that
 two
 nanometer
 chip
 can
 you


put
 it
 into
 perspective
 well
 the
 chip


itself
 is
 is
 not
 too
 small
 right
 the


chip
 itself
 is
 still
 a
 few
 millimeter
 by


a
 few
 millimeter
 what's
 is
 really
 really


small
 is
 is
 the
 size
 of
 the
 of
 the


transistor
 right
 2
 nanometer
 is
 is


basically
 about
 200
 time
 the
 size
 of
 a


silicon
 atom
 right
 so
 you
 you
 start


basically
 to
 to
 to
 look
 at
 Dimension


that
 come
 close
 to
 Atomic
 Dimension
 so


this
 is
 extremely
 small
 and
 it
 means


that
 the
 way
 those
 transistor
 are
 going


to
 work
 uh
 is
 such
 that
 people
 start
 to


count
 electrons
 as
 well
 uh
 so
 we
 are
 we


are
 getting
 as
 close
 uh
 as
 you
 can


imagine
 to
 uh
 to
 to
 to
 the
 limit
 of


physics
 or
 at
 least
 the
 limit
 of
 physics


as
 we
 we
 learn
 them
 at
 school
 and
 this


is
 what
 makes
 this
 uh
 this
 moment
 in


this
 industry
 so
 so
 exciting
 because


this
 require
 of
 course
 new
 innovation


now
 you
 um
 you
 spent
 I
 believe
 $6


billion
 to
 develop
 this
 over
 a
 very
 long


time
 frame
 um
 more
 than
 15
 years
 just


how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 cultivate
 that


type
 of
 long-term
 mindset
 yeah
 so
 we


spend
 a
 in
 more
 than


that
 but
 um
 you
 know
 what
 what
 is


defining
 I
 think
 ASL
 in
 many
 way
 and
 if


you
 ask
 me
 this
 is
 maybe
 what
 makes
 asml


unique
 we
 do
 things
 because
 we
 believe


this
 is
 the
 right
 things
 to
 do
 and
 when


we
 look
 at
 UV
 you
 know
 if
 you
 go
 back
 20


years
 ago
 we
 looked
 at
 different
 option


that
 could
 be
 used
 for
 lithography
 we


had


euv
 uh
 we
 had
 ebam
 uh
 we
 had
 what
 people


call
 still
 today
 Nano
 imprints
 which


consist
 in
 getting
 the
 rticle
 in
 contact


to
 the
 waer
 and
 each
 one
 of
 those


options
 were
 very
 very
 difficult
 and
 we


picked
 euv
 not
 because
 it
 was
 the


easiest
 one
 in
 fact
 euv
 was
 less


Advanced
 most
 probably
 than
 ebam
 or
 uh


basically
 uh
 Nano
 imprints
 but
 we
 picked


euv
 because
 we
 thought
 that
 this
 was
 the


only
 technology
 that
 over
 time
 could


scale
 to
 the
 point
 where
 we
 could


provide
 the
 resolution
 but
 also
 the


productivity
 meaning
 that
 we
 could
 also


provide
 this
 at
 the
 right
 cost
 and


that's
 how
 it


started
 and
 we
 were
 convinced
 that
 the


industry
 needed
 it
 which
 I
 think
 has


been
 proven
 since
 then
 I
 mean
 everyone


is
 aware
 of
 you
 know
 the
 story
 of
 uh
 uh


tsmc
 going
 to
 7
 5
 Nom
 with
 UV
 Intel
 not


doing
 that
 and
 you
 know
 what
 what
 was


the
 results
 of
 that
 so
 we
 were
 convinced


that
 the
 industry
 will
 need
 it
 and
 and


then
 we
 we
 we
 invested
 in
 that
 to
 to
 the


level
 we
 could
 afford
 it
 which
 if
 you


look
 back
 you
 know
 2025
 years
 ago
 ASL


was
 was
 not
 a
 very
 rich
 company
 in
 fact


we
 went
 as
 far
 as
 asking
 our
 customers


to
 to
 co-invest
 with
 us
 on
 the
 program


but
 we
 did
 it
 because
 we
 thought
 that


this
 had
 to
 be
 fixed
 and
 I
 can
 tell
 you


that
 that
 was
 not
 easy
 and
 for
 a
 long


time
 I
 think
 there
 was
 not
 even
 the


guarantee
 that
 this
 would
 work
 but
 there


was
 we
 thought
 most
 probably
 80%
 chance


that
 this
 would
 work
 because
 we
 still


understood
 the
 physics
 we
 still


understood
 the


fundamentals
 and
 this
 is
 the
 reason
 why


we
 went
 there
 and
 that
 could
 sound


strange
 FR
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 because


you
 know
 uh
 people
 could
 ask
 well
 did


you
 have
 at
 least
 a
 good
 business
 plan


uh
 and
 the
 answer
 at
 that
 time
 was
 no
 I


mean
 we
 couldn't
 find
 a
 way
 to
 to
 make


the
 business
 plan
 look
 even
 reasonable


right
 because
 the
 the
 channel
 was
 such


but
 there
 was
 this
 belief
 that
 if
 we
 get


it
 done
 and
 if
 this
 allowed
 the
 industry


to
 move
 forward
 this
 would
 be
 good
 for


the
 industry
 this
 would
 be
 of
 course


good
 for
 as
 a
 reses
 and
 I
 think
 we
 truly


believe
 in
 ASL
 that
 as
 long
 as
 we
 are


contributing
 to
 extend
 this
 industry
 by


one
 more
 node
 so
 as
 long
 as
 we
 extend


basically
 more
 low
 then
 we
 generate
 a


lot
 of
 value
 for
 everyone
 I
 mean
 the
 the


value
 chain
 here
 in
 this
 industry
 is
 is


really
 fascinating
 so
 you
 talked
 about


getting
 financing
 from
 your
 customers


they
 also
 took
 ownership
 stakes
 in
 you


yeah
 at
 some
 point
 they
 did
 uh
 how
 how


important
 has
 that
 been
 for
 the
 uh
 for


the
 corporation
 this
 was
 for
 for


tourison
 uh
 the
 first
 one
 maybe
 the
 most


important
 part
 it
 was
 showing
 also
 the


commitment
 they
 had
 on
 the
 technology
 so


I
 think
 it
 was
 very
 important
 for
 us
 to


to
 have
 this
 alignment
 with
 the
 the
 key


players
 to
 know
 that
 euv
 was
 important


for
 them
 and
 I
 think
 that
 their


co-investment
 was
 the
 proof
 of
 that
 and


you
 know
 again
 at
 a
 time
 where
 uh
 the


ability
 for
 asml
 to
 invest
 in
 R&D
 was


for
 sure
 less
 than
 it
 is
 today
 uh
 this


also
 gave
 us
 enough
 fund
 practically
 to


to
 accelerate
 the
 development
 of
 UV
 so
 I


think
 this


co-investment
 uh
 program
 most
 probably


accelerated
 the
 whole
 euv
 program
 by


let's
 say
 maybe
 3
 to
 five
 years
 which


which
 you
 know
 is
 is
 significant
 and


again
 we
 had
 partner
 you
 know
 we
 had


people
 that
 days
 after
 days
 night
 after


night
 were
 were
 walking
 with
 us
 we're


together
 uh
 on
 on
 the
 same
 uh
 on
 the


same
 trip
 to
 get
 UV
 to
 work
 okay
 that's


very
 important
 because
 if
 you're
 going


to
 do
 something
 that
 difficult
 you
 know


you
 feel
 better
 if
 you're
 not
 alone


right
 absolutely
 talking
 of
 which
 uh
 you


also
 work
 very
 closely
 with
 size
 on
 on


the


Optics
 um
 tell
 us
 about
 that


relationship
 so
 this
 is
 a
 German
 Optics


company
 well
 so
 you
 know
 when
 Ze
 and


asml
 talk
 about
 the
 relationship
 we
 said


this
 this
 relationship
 is
 is
 worse
 than


a
 marriage
 because
 we
 can
 never
 get


divorce
 right
 we
 have
 created
 a
 level
 of


in
 interdependency
 between
 the
 two


company
 which
 which
 is
 extremely


high
 and
 the
 reason
 for
 that
 is
 we
 made


the
 choice
 from
 the
 very
 beginning
 to


focus
 on
 what
 we
 were
 good
 at
 and
 Ze
 is


extremely
 good
 on
 optic
 they
 have
 become


excellent
 over
 time
 of
 course
 they
 have


gone
 also
 through
 their
 learning
 for


more
 than
 30
 years
 and
 their
 learning


has
 allowed
 them
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do


something
 like
 euv
 or
 even
 Ina
 today


uh
 while
 in
 parallel
 we
 were
 doing
 the


same
 learning
 basically
 on
 everything


else
 that
 lithography
 has
 to
 provide
 why


don't
 you
 merge
 well
 because
 I
 think
 you


know
 you
 you
 need
 to
 want
 it
 and
 I
 think


this
 this
 has
 never
 been
 the
 case
 and


and
 there
 you
 know
 you
 you
 touch
 to


culture
 you
 touch
 to
 history
 uh
 you


touch
 to
 business
 model
 and
 what
 we
 have


learned
 over
 time
 is
 uh
 that
 even
 if
 you


don't
 merge
 you
 can
 develop
 model
 that
 I


would
 say
 can
 become
 almost
 even
 maybe


more
 effective
 than
 if
 you
 were
 to
 merge


because
 in
 the
 way
 we
 walk
 everyone
 does


its
 own
 things
 with
 its
 own
 culture
 its


own
 mind
 and
 I
 think
 this
 has
 been
 a


strength
 to
 be
 honest
 over
 time
 it's


very
 good
 to
 have
 a


partner
 that
 is
 also
 different
 from
 you


and
 that
 therefore
 not
 only
 is
 able
 to


work
 with
 you
 but
 is
 always
 able
 to


challenge
 also
 the
 way
 you
 do
 things
 and


I
 think
 that's
 that's
 part
 of
 the
 the


great
 relationship
 with
 we
 have
 with
 ice


Where
 do
 you
 um
 see
 AI
 developing
 over


the
 next
 few
 years
 I
 mean
 we're
 seeing


you
 know
 xai


putting
 10
 like
 100,000
 uh
 gpus
 to
 form


Colossus
 uh
 just
 an
 incredible


development
 just
 now
 yeah
 so
 I
 think


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 very
 very
 important


question
 for
 this
 industry
 and
 if
 I


start
 start
 with
 the


end
 I'm
 a
 True
 Believer
 of
 AI
 of
 what
 AI


can
 do
 basically
 for
 I
 would
 say
 for


Humanity
 and
 the
 reason
 for
 that
 is
 if
 I


look
 at
 what
 we
 have
 been
 doing
 in
 ASL


uh
 we
 see
 many
 many
 places
 where
 AI
 can


help
 the
 most
 important
 part
 I
 think
 is


R&D
 at
 the
 end
 I
 think
 the
 the
 the


strongest
 potential
 value
 of
 AI
 is
 to
 be


able
 to
 accelerate
 our
 uh
 learning
 cycle


so
 in
 some
 way
 accelerate


R&D
 and
 improve
 our
 product
 and
 all
 of


that
 can
 be
 done
 because
 in
 the
 past
 few


years
 the
 amount
 of
 data
 we
 have
 been


generating
 to
 develop
 our
 product
 but


also
 the
 amount
 of
 data
 we
 generate
 once


our
 product
 are
 running
 at
 our
 customer


is
 enormous
 so
 there
 is
 a
 huge
 untapped


potential
 of
 making
 good
 use
 of
 this


data
 and
 AI
 can
 do
 that
 but
 now
 what
 we


also
 see
 is
 that
 to
 trust
 AI


to
 do
 that
 the
 models
 that
 are
 needed


have
 to
 be
 even
 better
 than
 what
 we
 see


today
 so
 the
 number
 of
 parameters
 that


model
 will
 have
 to
 use
 is
 going
 to
 grow


very
 quickly
 most
 probably
 also


exponentially
 so
 there's
 another
 low


also
 there
 with


AI
 and
 that
 require
 even
 more
 High


computing
 power
 so
 we
 will
 first
 see
 a


huge
 demand
 of
 high
 computing
 power
 with


more
 advanced
 technology
 so
 3
 nanometer


2
 nanometer
 and
 we'll
 go
 to
 angstrom


type
 of
 node
 all
 of
 that
 I
 think
 we
 will


find
 a
 lot
 of
 appetite
 from
 AI
 people
 to


use
 it
 so
 that's
 the
 first
 part
 and
 this


will
 I
 would
 say
 create
 huge
 opportunity


the
 second
 part
 is
 how
 are
 those


opportunity
 going
 to
 to
 play
 a
 roll
 out


in
 the
 next
 few
 years
 and
 I
 think
 that's


the
 most
 difficult
 question
 so
 we
 a
 lot


of
 us
 I
 think
 are
 very
 convinced
 about


the
 huge
 potential
 AI
 has
 to
 offer
 I


think
 none
 of
 us
 know
 exactly
 at
 which


speed
 this
 will
 come
 basically
 to
 the


market
 if
 I
 may
 say
 because
 at
 some


point
 of
 time
 AI
 has
 to
 be
 more
 than


just
 you
 know
 an
 activity
 around


research
 and
 development
 this
 has
 to
 be


translated
 into
 product
 who's
 going
 to


be
 the
 winner
 here
 well
 I
 think
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day
 you
 know
 I
 always
 believe


that
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 model
 software
 you


will
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 can
 do


that
 I
 believe
 that
 the
 way
 you
 will


design
 your
 Hardware
 the
 way
 you
 will


architect
 basically
 uh
 the
 chips
 is
 is


very
 very
 important
 this
 is
 why
 company


like
 Nvidia
 AMD
 uh
 you
 know
 a
 few
 more


most
 probably
 moving
 forward
 will
 really


fight
 for
 that
 because
 I
 think
 that


product
 enable
 whatever
 algorithm
 people


may
 uh
 think
 on
 top
 of
 that
 and
 of


course
 those
 product
 can
 only
 exist
 if


you
 know
 company
 like
 tsmc
 Intel
 Samsung


provide
 the
 technology
 to
 create
 a
 chip


and
 those
 company
 can
 only
 do
 that
 if


they
 continue
 to
 use
 our
 uh
 lithography


tools
 yeah
 so
 you
 will
 have
 I


think
 quite
 some
 winners
 and
 you
 cannot


pick
 one
 because
 if
 you
 were
 to
 take
 out


any
 of
 those
 name
 everyone
 lose
 right


the
 beauty
 also
 of
 this
 ecosystem
 we
 we


need
 each
 other
 right
 the
 talking
 which


the
 super
 scalers
 are
 now
 designing


their
 own
 chips
 how
 good
 are
 these
 chips


I
 think
 they
 are
 very
 good
 and
 I
 think


they
 they
 will
 get
 better
 over
 time
 I


think
 uh
 today
 the
 chips
 that
 are
 being


used
 both
 for
 memory
 or
 logic
 were
 not


even
 necessarily
 designed
 for
 AI
 I
 think


people
 have
 just
 taken
 the
 best
 chips


available
 at
 the
 moment
 which
 is
 gpus
 uh


and


high
 band
 with
 memory
 for
 example
 but
 I


think
 both
 in
 logic
 and
 in
 memory
 we


will
 see
 major
 design
 change
 to
 optimize


chips
 further
 for
 AI
 I
 think
 this
 this


is
 most
 probably
 happening
 as
 we
 speak
 I


think
 that
 those
 chips
 are
 pretty
 good


but
 I
 think
 there
 is
 still
 major


Improvement
 possible
 and
 you
 know
 this


will
 also
 have
 an
 impact
 on
 the
 type
 of


chips
 our
 own
 customer
 uh
 will


manufacture
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 one
 of
 the


very
 interesting
 things
 with
 ai
 ai
 is


changing
 the
 industry
 you
 know
 it's
 not


that
 you
 only
 see
 new
 product
 you
 see


those
 product
 becoming
 the
 most


important
 one
 for
 the
 industry
 so
 for
 a


long
 time
 this
 was


Mobile
 today
 it's
 Ai
 and
 it
 means
 that


the
 run
 map
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 including


our
 run
 map
 uh
 will
 shift
 basically
 with


the
 idea
 that
 we
 want
 to
 serve
 this
 new


opportunity
 but
 I
 think
 those
 chips


good
 but
 they
 will
 be
 a
 lot
 better
 in
 a


few
 years
 from
 now
 when
 I
 prepared
 for


for
 this
 podcast
 I
 uh
 I
 conferred
 with


Chris
 Miller
 who
 wrote
 U
 the
 book
 the


chip
 Wars
 and
 who
 is
 one
 of
 the
 leading


experts
 in
 the
 world
 and
 and
 um
 he
 was


just
 wondering
 given
 how
 much
 of
 the
 uh


development
 and
 R&D
 and
 so
 on
 in
 the


world
 which
 now
 depends
 on
 getting


smaller
 and
 smaller
 chips
 uh
 how
 do
 you


feel
 about
 having
 this
 incredible
 weight


on
 your
 shoulders
 well
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 a


huge
 uh
 it's
 a
 huge
 responsibility
 I


think
 that's
 the
 first
 feeling
 you
 get


because


uh
 well
 you
 know
 you
 said
 it
 in
 your


introduction
 we
 used
 to
 be
 this
 this


company
 no
 one
 knows
 about
 I
 think
 this


has
 changed
 quite
 a
 bit
 I
 think
 we
 are


today
 a
 company
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people


rely
 on
 basically
 in
 order
 to
 be
 able
 to


to
 to
 to
 create
 their
 product
 uh
 and
 I


think
 that's
 that's
 a
 huge


responsibility
 and
 this
 means
 for
 us


that
 more
 than
 ever
 we
 have
 to
 continue


to
 develop
 our
 product
 so
 that
 you
 know


we
 never
 become
 the
 bottleneck
 to
 this


industry
 uh
 we
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 can


produce
 them
 in
 enough
 capacity
 whatever


the
 capacity
 will
 be
 needed
 so
 that


everyone
 can
 play
 so
 you
 know
 we
 serve


the
 market
 in
 a
 in
 a
 very
 fair
 way
 and


you
 know
 this
 of
 course
 create
 a
 lot
 of


uh
 of
 Pride
 for
 every
 isml
 employee
 you


know
 I
 think
 the
 if
 you
 are
 an
 engineer


and
 you
 tell
 an
 engineer
 that
 what
 you


do
 nowadays
 is
 is
 at
 the
 core
 most


probably
 of
 any
 major
 Innovation
 moving


forward
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 lot
 of


Pride
 as
 well
 so
 you
 have
 responsibility


you
 have
 pride
 and
 I
 think
 this
 also
 put


us
 in
 a
 place
 sorry
 where
 I
 think
 we


understand
 we
 we
 have
 to
 play
 our
 hole


so
 I
 think
 this
 this
 have
 changed
 a
 bit


uh
 I
 would
 say
 the
 the
 way
 isml
 has
 been


looking
 at
 the
 war
 and
 I
 think
 you
 have


seen
 our
 involvement
 as
 a
 results
 a
 lot


more
 uh
 strong
 a
 lot
 more
 a
 lot
 stronger


than
 it
 used
 to
 be
 changing
 um
 uh
 tax
 a


bit
 um
 the
 geopolitical
 tensions
 that
 we


have
 now
 between
 the
 US
 and
 China
 what


are
 the
 implications
 for
 you
 well
 I


think
 there
 are
 many
 many
 implication


because
 you
 know
 we
 went
 to
 a
 former


world
 where
 we
 were
 looking
 at
 a
 you


know
 very
 very
 open
 collaborative
 world


right
 as
 think
 the
 idea
 a
 few
 years
 ago


was
 that
 you
 know
 we
 are
 going
 to
 do


business
 everywhere
 everyone
 can
 work


with


everyone
 and
 this
 has
 supported
 I
 will


say
 the
 development
 of
 our
 industry


quite
 significantly
 because
 every
 part


became
 important
 and
 we
 go
 from
 that


view
 of
 the
 world
 to
 a
 view
 of
 the
 world


where
 people
 more
 and
 more
 are
 looking


at
 potentially
 the
 coupling
 things
 and


this
 changed
 of
 course
 everything


because
 the
 way
 way
 this
 industry
 was


designed
 the
 way
 this
 industry
 has


developed
 was
 based
 on
 the
 previous
 hols


it
 was
 based
 on
 a
 completely
 open
 market


it
 was
 based
 on
 the
 idea
 that
 you
 can


basically
 use
 the
 revenue
 of
 more


advanced


product
 uh
 sorry
 the
 revenue
 of
 less


Advanced
 product
 that
 you
 have
 developed


a
 few
 years
 before
 to
 fund
 the


development
 of
 more
 advanced
 one


so
 you
 had
 this
 balance
 which
 which
 I


think
 is
 a
 bit
 being
 put
 in
 question
 so


this
 require
 quite
 some
 some


adjustment
 and
 I
 think
 we
 see
 two
 main


risk
 on
 that
 the
 the
 main
 one
 is
 cost


you
 know
 because
 if
 you
 get
 less


Revenue
 you
 have
 less
 ability
 to
 do
 R&D


except
 if
 your
 cost


increase
 if
 you
 are
 limited
 in


geographic
 area
 to
 produce
 things
 cost


could
 also
 goes
 up
 I
 think
 we
 all
 very


much
 aware
 that
 for
 example
 that
 when
 it


comes
 to
 build
 to
 manufactur
 of
 chips


the
 US
 Europe
 are
 a
 lot
 more
 expensive


than


Asia
 uh
 that's
 also
 most
 probably
 slow


down
 a
 bit
 uh
 The
 Innovation
 because


again
 we
 we
 used
 to
 have
 this
 very
 open


ecosystem
 uh
 and
 this
 this
 may
 be
 also
 a


question
 so
 this
 makes
 things
 of
 course


a
 bit
 more
 difficult
 or
 potentially
 a


lot
 more
 difficult
 depending
 on
 how
 far


you
 push
 basically
 the
 decoupling
 model


so
 it's
 very
 fundamental
 yeah
 know


absolutely
 how
 how
 far
 behind
 is
 China


here
 now
 well
 I
 think
 I
 think
 I've
 said


that
 a
 few
 say
 few
 times
 publicly
 I


think
 and
 a
 few
 people
 have
 said
 that
 so


China
 doesn't
 have
 access
 to


euv
 and
 euv
 is
 critical
 for
 advanced


logic
 I
 think
 this
 has
 been
 demonstrated


in
 the
 Western
 World
 I
 go
 back
 again
 to


the
 tsmc
 in
 their
 story
 uh
 you
 know
 euv


was
 uh
 introduced
 for
 R&D
 around
 2016
 17


started
 to
 go
 to
 production
 around


2018
 and
 uh
 this
 means
 that
 China
 is
 at


least
 I
 would
 say
 10
 years
 behind
 and


most
 probably
 a
 bit
 more
 because
 as
 we


were
 looking
 back
 in
 201
 you
 know
 16
 17


they
 were
 already
 you
 know
 a
 couple
 of


generation
 behind
 so
 you
 know
 10
 15


years
 is
 most
 probably
 if
 you
 look
 at


logic
 where
 where
 they
 stand
 and
 it's


very
 very
 difficult
 to
 do
 Advanced
 logic


without
 UV
 you
 you
 can
 of
 course
 make
 a


few
 chips
 over
 time
 a
 few


transistor
 but
 you
 cannot
 do
 it
 in


volume
 you
 cannot
 do
 it
 at
 a
 cost
 that


is
 reasonable
 so
 you
 cannot
 do
 it
 in
 a


way
 that
 is


economically
 viable
 Taiwan
 is
 in
 the


middle
 of
 this
 whole
 value
 chain
 what


how
 risky
 is
 that
 well
 I
 I
 think
 that
 uh


you
 know
 it's
 it's
 a
 very
 difficult


question
 I
 I
 I


uh
 you
 know
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 to
 be
 honest


because
 you
 you
 you
 can
 speculate
 on


that
 uh
 you
 can
 only
 have
 an


opinion
 uh
 there's
 always
 a
 risk
 of


course
 to
 to
 have
 uh
 the
 supply
 chain


concentrated
 in
 in
 one
 place
 I
 think
 no


one
 can
 argue
 with
 that
 but
 then
 I
 would


say
 we
 we
 we
 we
 present
 a
 similar
 risk


for
 for
 the
 market
 in
 this
 sense
 um
 you


know
 guessing
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 on


geopolitics
 is
 is
 is
 difficult
 because


anything
 happening
 with
 Taiwan
 will
 have


major
 implication
 for
 for
 the
 entire


world
 clearly
 so
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 one
 of


the
 people
 who
 who
 are
 very
 uh
 much


looking
 at
 very
 bad
 scenario
 to
 Taiwan
 I


think
 those
 are
 very
 unlikely
 uh
 but


again
 that's
 that's
 more
 of
 a
 personal


opinion
 than
 anything
 else
 I'm
 I'm
 sure


you
 have
 your
 own
 uh
 but
 I
 think
 what
 is


for
 sure
 certain
 is
 that
 the
 tension


could
 could
 raise
 over
 time
 and
 how
 fast


do
 you
 think
 one
 can
 rrap
 up
 chip


Manufacturing
 in
 US
 Japan
 South
 Korea


well
 I
 think
 the
 the
 manufacturing
 part


is
 is
 one
 thing
 uh
 the
 R&D
 part
 is


another
 thing
 I
 think
 when
 you
 look
 at


chips
 you
 need
 to
 have
 R&D
 first
 you


know
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 R&D
 meaning
 if


you
 don't
 have


somewhere
 someone
 that
 provide
 you
 the


next
 generation
 of
 chips
 it's
 a
 matter


of
 time
 even
 if
 you
 have
 manufacturing


that
 you
 manufacture
 things
 that
 are
 not


very
 relevant
 so
 I
 think
 the
 access
 to


R&D
 is
 is
 very
 very


important
 and
 I
 truly
 believe
 that
 when


it
 comes
 to
 Advanced


chips
 you
 only
 can
 do
 those
 things
 if


you
 have
 the
 history
 it's
 a
 bit
 like
 the


story
 I
 gave
 you
 about
 asml
 and
 Z
 I


think
 we
 can
 do
 euv
 today
 because
 we


have
 done
 everything
 before
 we
 believe


it's
 very
 hard
 for
 anyone
 to
 start
 from


scratch
 and
 do
 UV
 I
 think
 it's
 the
 same


for
 chips
 I
 think
 the
 idea
 that
 someone


could
 just
 create
 an
 R&D
 Center
 and
 be


able
 to
 do
 uh
 you
 know
 2
 nanometer
 or


1.4
 nanom
 I
 think
 is
 from
 my
 point
 of


view
 extremely
 difficult
 if
 not


impossible
 and
 that's
 you
 know
 that's


where
 you
 see
 those
 cooporation
 even
 for


example
 Japan
 of
 course
 is
 is
 looking
 at


doing
 2
 nanom
 logic
 but
 this
 is
 using
 uh


technology
 from
 uh
 from
 from
 IBM
 right


so
 you
 cannot
 just
 come
 out
 of
 the
 blue


on
 on
 those
 kind
 of
 things
 so
 if
 you


don't
 have
 it
 I
 think
 it
 takes
 a
 very


very
 long
 time
 but
 yet
 the
 um
 you
 have


chip
 acts
 in
 in
 various
 countries
 you


have
 it
 in
 the
 US
 uh
 you
 got
 uh
 similar


things
 in
 Japan
 UK
 EU
 just
 uh
 uh
 really


huge
 amounts
 ofy


um
 so
 how
 do
 you
 view
 this
 well
 it's


huge
 but
 you
 know
 the
 problem
 is
 it
 all


depends
 on
 the
 scale
 you're
 looking
 at


and
 I
 think
 chipped
 acts
 from
 my
 point


of
 view
 are
 are
 good
 to
 motivate
 people


to
 restart
 the
 engine
 or
 to
 do
 some


initial


investment
 but
 I
 know
 I
 said
 it
 a
 few


times
 already
 in
 in
 discussion
 cost
 is


very
 important
 for
 this
 industry


you
 need
 to
 get
 it
 right
 and
 the
 problem


with
 chip
 is
 that
 they
 don't
 solve
 that


chip
 taxs
 can
 help
 you
 to
 to
 put
 a


factory
 to
 buy
 some
 tool
 to
 get
 going


for
 one
 note
 but
 what's
 very
 important


that's
 discussion
 we
 have
 with
 many


government
 is
 to
 also
 make
 sure
 that
 you


create
 a
 condition
 where
 you
 can
 compete


on
 cost
 and
 on


flexibility
 because
 you
 know
 subsidies


are
 usually
 something
 that
 do
 not
 last


forever
 and
 if
 over
 time
 you
 don't
 solve


structurally
 competitive
 disadvantage


you
 may
 have
 on
 cost
 or


flexibility
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 know
 you


boost
 for
 a
 while
 the
 R&D
 or
 uh
 the


construction
 of
 new
 Fab
 is
 in
 no
 way
 a


guarantee
 of
 success
 for
 the
 future
 so
 I


think
 that's
 the
 part
 I
 think
 that
 is


very
 important
 to
 understand
 this


industry
 is
 very
 competitive
 very


sensitive
 to
 cost
 chip
 tax
 I
 think
 have


helped
 to
 re
 uh
 uh
 re
 recreate
 a
 bit


some
 uh
 activity
 and
 some
 interest
 and


give
 a
 chance
 again
 for
 some
 country
 to


restart
 in
 semiconductor
 but
 all
 those


country
 will
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 they


become
 competitive
 and
 I
 think
 that's


that's
 a
 very
 that's
 most
 more
 difficult


part
 of
 the
 50
 largest
 technology


companies
 in
 the
 world
 only
 four
 are
 in


Europe
 so
 a
 naive
 question
 here
 why
 why


is
 that
 well
 I
 I
 think
 you
 know
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 very
 it's
 a
 very
 tough
 question


in
 Europe
 and
 you
 know
 if
 you
 knew
 the


amount
 of
 time
 we
 we
 spent
 having
 this


exact
 same
 same
 same
 discussion
 but
 you


know
 I
 already
 touched
 on
 some
 of
 that


uh
 you
 know
 I
 talked
 about
 flexibility


uh
 I
 talked
 about
 cost
 this
 is
 very


important
 I
 think
 access
 to
 Capital
 is


also
 very
 very
 critical
 you
 you
 you
 need


to
 be
 able
 to
 invest
 I
 think
 today


access
 to
 Capital
 is
 a
 lot
 stronger
 in


the
 US
 uh
 than
 it
 is
 in
 Europe
 uh
 I


think
 you
 know
 that
 very
 well
 right
 but


a
 lot
 even
 of
 the
 capital
 usually
 being


used
 to
 invest
 in
 Europe
 come
 from
 from


the
 US
 so
 that's
 something
 people


underestimate
 that's
 very


important
 access
 to
 resources
 to
 uh
 you


know
 electricity
 power
 uh
 the
 price
 of


the
 power
 all
 of
 that
 are
 very
 very


important
 things
 and
 you
 see
 a
 lot
 of


those
 debate
 happening
 today
 in
 Europe


This
 are
 discussion
 we're
 having
 of


course
 with
 with
 our
 government
 you
 know


we
 we
 made
 a
 decision
 to
 stand
 ourself


you
 know
 in
 the
 Netherland
 because
 that


makes
 sense
 for
 us
 but
 we
 only
 can
 do


that
 if
 we
 have
 the
 infrastructure
 if
 we


have
 the
 energy
 if
 we
 have
 all
 those


things
 so
 the
 reason
 why
 you
 have
 less


company
 in
 Europe
 than
 maybe
 other
 place


of
 the
 world
 is
 because
 those
 things


today
 are
 just
 more
 difficult
 and
 you


know
 Mario
 dragy
 Just
 published
 a
 report


in
 Europe
 which
 I
 think
 described
 that


very
 very
 nicely
 and
 now
 what's


important
 is
 to
 have
 the
 political
 will


to
 reinvest
 uh
 in
 the
 future
 and


basically
 create
 opportunity
 I
 think


that's
 very
 very
 important
 and
 are
 we


going
 to
 see
 this
 well
 I
 think
 it's


almost
 you
 know
 a
 matter
 of
 Life
 of


death
 at
 some
 point
 because
 what
 if
 you


never
 see
 it
 yeah
 so
 what
 is
 left
 in
 a


few
 years
 from
 now
 so
 I
 think
 you
 see


more
 and
 more
 people
 talking
 about
 this


in
 more
 and
 more
 country
 because
 I
 think


it's
 a
 will
 for
 uh
 the
 people
 to
 to


really
 be
 able
 to
 to
 to
 have
 those


interesting
 company
 do
 interesting
 job


you
 know
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 SML
 I
 was


telling
 you
 about
 the
 pride
 of
 our


employee
 I
 mean
 any
 educated
 person
 in


Europe
 wants
 to
 have
 a
 chance
 to
 walk
 in


a
 great
 company
 it's
 fine
 to
 talk
 but
 is


are
 things
 happening
 I
 think
 they
 are


happening
 I
 think
 we
 could
 easily
 agree


they
 are
 too
 slow
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 the


dialogue
 between
 po
 politics
 and


Industrial
 is
 most
 probably
 increasing


in
 Europe
 uh
 the
 challenge
 most
 probably


will
 be
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 bring
 the
 entire


population
 on
 board
 because
 those
 topics


are
 not
 always
 easy
 to
 explain
 and
 these


are
 not
 the
 topic
 that
 maybe
 are
 the


easiest
 for
 politician
 to
 to
 pursue
 to


to
 get
 elected
 now
 Val
 Hoven
 is
 a
 small


uh
 uh
 town
 of
 45,000
 people
 uh
 on
 the


Dutch
 Belgium
 border
 it's
 not
 uh
 it's


not
 the
 obvious
 place
 for
 one
 of
 the
 one


of
 the
 most
 important
 companies
 in
 the


world
 to
 to
 be
 situated
 how
 how
 come
 you


ended
 up
 there
 well
 I
 think
 uh
 we
 used


to
 have
 a
 a
 bigger
 brother
 called


Phillips
 you
 know
 that
 Phillips
 used
 to


be
 an
 extremely
 successful
 uh


company
 uh
 and
 Phillips
 created
 uh
 you


know
 Back
 40
 50
 years
 ago
 a
 lot
 of
 uh


basically
 a


startup
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 startup


became
 uh
 significant
 company
 so
 asml
 is


one
 of
 them
 I
 think
 you
 know
 ISM


International
 is
 another
 one
 right
 so


they
 we
 come
 from
 the
 same
 uh
 same
 roots


in
 some
 way
 and
 Phillips
 also
 had


developed
 this
 uh
 culture
 of
 innovation


so
 you
 know
 SML
 is
 sitting
 in
 an
 area


that
 we
 call
 the
 the
 brand
 Port
 uh
 and


the
 brand
 Port
 is
 still
 a
 very
 Lively
 uh


area
 in
 Europe
 when
 it
 comes
 to


Innovation
 I
 think
 that's
 still
 built
 uh


on
 the
 old
 concept
 of
 of
 pH
 so
 that


that's
 why
 we
 are
 here
 and
 I
 think
 over


time
 you
 know
 we
 have
 developed
 a
 very


strong


ecosystem
 we
 talk
 a
 lot
 about
 you
 know


ASL
 we
 talked
 a
 bit
 about
 Z
 but
 our


supply
 chain
 is
 critical
 of
 course
 you


know
 we
 talked
 about
 the
 optic
 but
 uh


mechatronics
 is
 very
 important
 and
 all


of
 that
 is
 also
 done
 in
 Europe
 in


Netherland
 in
 Germany
 so
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 critical
 company
 that
 are
 also


contributing
 to
 Our
 Success
 of
 course


they
 are
 a
 lot
 less
 known
 than
 asml
 so


they
 are
 still
 a
 bit
 obscure
 most


probably
 but
 they
 have
 been
 growing
 with


with
 asls
 I
 think
 the
 whole
 supply
 chain


around
 the
 uh
 you
 know
 uh
 ven
 even
 in


ven
 or
 IND
 which
 is
 the
 bigger
 city
 on


the
 side
 are
 very
 critical
 how
 would
 you


describe
 the
 corpor
 culture
 at
 asml
 I


think
 you


know
 what
 people
 usually
 say
 first
 about


Asm


is
 that
 this
 is
 a
 nonpolitical


organization
 meaning
 that
 people
 don't


do
 things
 basically
 in
 order
 to
 gain


credit
 for
 themselves
 they
 do
 things
 for


the
 good
 of
 the
 company
 and
 I
 think


that's
 something
 that
 is
 very
 very


strong
 and
 this
 create
 both
 a
 style
 of


management
 but
 also
 a
 style
 of


interaction
 between
 between
 people
 so


I'll
 give
 you
 an
 example
 of


employees
 uh
 feel
 very
 natural
 to


challenge
 us
 on
 anything
 I'm
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 company
 uh
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 that


people
 don't
 argue
 with
 me
 uh
 no
 you


know
 when
 we
 engage
 on
 any
 topic


technical
 non-
 technical
 uh
 there
 will


be
 a
 debate
 because
 there
 is
 this
 belief


that
 the
 debate
 has
 to
 take
 place
 to


really
 uh
 create
 and
 bring
 the
 best


possible
 decision
 so
 that's
 a
 bit
 asml


and
 that
 culture
 has
 been
 very
 very


solid
 for
 many
 many
 years
 of
 course


we've
 been
 growing
 so
 we
 we
 also
 have
 to


make
 sure
 that
 this
 culture
 doesn't
 go


against
 you
 know
 inclusion
 of
 the
 people


joining
 us
 so
 it's
 sometime
 a
 bit
 also


rough
 people
 thought
 in
 the
 you
 know
 in


the
 past
 this
 was
 a
 bit
 rough
 but
 um
 the


the
 very
 high
 focus
 on
 doing
 what
 is


right
 for
 our
 customer
 and
 therefore
 for


the
 company
 I
 think
 is
 is
 at
 at
 the
 core


of
 SML
 and
 as
 a
 result
 you
 see
 a
 very


open
 very


Lively
 uh
 company
 U
 it
 still
 feel
 like
 a


family
 company
 also
 you
 know
 it's
 pretty


big
 nowadays
 of
 course
 we
 have
 44,000


people
 so
 you
 could
 say
 it's
 pretty
 big


but
 the
 the
 way
 I
 know
 my
 colleagues
 the


way
 I
 know
 the
 leadership
 we
 we
 we
 still


feel
 this
 is
 not
 a
 very
 big
 team
 uh
 and


that's
 very
 interesting
 so
 we
 we
 have
 we


have
 kept
 I
 would
 say
 the
 essential
 of


the
 DNA
 uh
 while
 of
 course
 finding
 ways


to
 to
 scale
 to
 to
 the
 size
 we
 have
 today


in
 your
 mind
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 good


leadership
 humbleness
 I
 would
 say
 that's


the
 first
 world
 that
 comes
 to
 mind
 I


think
 you
 you
 have
 to
 remember
 humble
 I


think
 you
 you
 have
 to
 to
 remember
 that


you're
 uh
 serving
 a
 bigger
 cause
 I
 think


it's
 very
 very
 important
 you
 need
 to
 be


authentic
 people
 have
 to
 see
 you
 for


what
 you
 are
 I
 think
 there
 should
 be
 no


artificial
 discussion
 or
 there
 should
 be


no
 you
 know
 attempt
 to
 try
 to
 please


people
 or
 to
 convince
 people
 I
 think
 you


have
 to
 be
 very
 authentic
 you
 have
 to
 be


direct
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 work
 hard
 uh


lead
 by
 example
 I
 think
 you
 have


to
 stay
 on
 content
 you
 know
 sometime


when
 people
 gets
 to
 bigger
 hole


they
 sometime
 believe
 that
 everything


can
 be
 solved
 by
 processes
 I
 think


processes
 are
 very
 important
 to
 make


things
 happen


at
 scale
 but
 content
 is
 essential


especially
 in
 this
 industry
 you
 need
 to


know
 basically
 what
 is
 happening
 so
 that


you
 can
 anticipate
 what
 could
 happen


next
 you
 need
 to
 be
 strategic
 so
 you


have
 to
 be
 able
 basically
 to
 to
 dream
 I


think
 being
 able
 to
 dream
 is
 very
 very


important
 for
 leaders
 and
 at
 the
 same


time
 you
 have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 explain
 that


dream
 in
 a
 very
 simple
 way
 very
 clear


way
 so
 that
 people
 can
 translate
 it
 into


things
 they
 can
 execute
 on
 so
 you
 see


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 and
 I
 don't
 know


in
 which
 order
 I
 I
 brought
 them
 to
 you


but


that's
 Let's
 do
 let's
 do
 two
 of
 them
 um


how
 do
 you
 stay
 on
 content
 well
 that


that's
 that's
 easy
 uh
 because
 I
 I
 don't


know
 how
 to
 do
 it
 differently
 so
 for
 for


me
 that's
 that's
 uh
 you
 know
 if
 I
 if
 I


don't
 have
 content
 discussion
 with
 my


engineer
 my
 operation
 people
 my
 sales


people
 my
 customer
 my
 supplier


I
 feel
 I
 do
 something
 wrong
 because
 I


feel
 that
 I
 lose
 the
 connection
 to
 what


is
 essential
 you
 know
 I
 often
 tell
 the


people
 in
 smml
 if
 we
 if
 our
 customer


trust
 us
 if
 we
 do
 the
 right
 product
 for


them
 because
 we
 understand
 them
 because


we
 listen
 to
 them
 I
 think
 the
 rest
 will


be
 fine
 we
 have
 to
 manage
 the
 company
 in


a
 very
 good
 way
 but
 we
 will
 be
 fine
 in


fact
 we'll
 be
 more
 than
 fine
 but
 those


two
 things
 customer
 trust
 having
 the


right
 product
 that's
 content
 you
 you


don't
 have
 that
 if
 you
 don't
 have


content
 and
 therefore
 for
 me
 if
 I
 don't


have
 access
 to
 this
 information
 for
 for


a
 bit
 I
 I
 will
 very
 quickly
 feel
 that


I'm
 I'm
 mostly
 not
 leading
 the
 company


in
 the
 right
 way
 why
 is
 storytelling


important
 storytelling
 is
 important


because
 you
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 explain


people
 why
 things
 are


important
 and
 the
 only
 way
 to
 do
 that
 is


to


simplify
 I
 could
 tell
 you
 euv
 is
 very


complex
 I
 prefer
 to
 tell
 you
 euv
 is
 very


simple
 you
 ask
 me
 to
 explain
 you
 UV
 in


one
 minute
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 right


question
 because
 you
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to


explain
 what
 you
 do
 and
 if
 it
 takes
 you


too
 many
 words
 to
 do
 that
 then
 you
 don't


explain
 it
 ever
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 very


important
 to
 to
 the
 story
 telling
 is


very
 important
 the
 simplification
 the


clarity
 around
 what
 you
 do
 I
 think
 is


very
 important
 where
 did
 you
 learn
 it
 I


think
 you
 learn
 it
 over
 time
 you
 see


people
 doing
 that
 you
 also
 see
 the


effect
 of
 having
 a
 simple
 Story
 versus
 a


complicated
 story
 and
 I
 think
 you
 need


to
 have
 affinity
 for
 it
 I
 think
 that


there's
 part
 of
 it
 which
 is
 your
 own


character
 I
 think
 uh
 you


know
 you
 know
 there
 are
 things
 that
 most


probably
 you
 are
 born
 with
 I
 will
 say


and
 that's
 helpful
 but
 I
 think
 you
 if


you
 pay
 attention
 to
 it
 and
 I
 invite


usually
 my
 my
 emplo
 to
 do
 that
 to
 if
 you


pay
 attention
 on
 how
 far
 you
 will
 go
 if


you
 give
 a
 simple
 story
 and
 people


understand
 it
 if
 you
 can
 make
 your
 case


I
 think
 making
 your
 case
 is
 a
 very


important
 thing
 I
 always
 say
 you
 you
 you


cannot
 convince
 people
 you
 you
 have
 to


give
 them
 the
 element
 so
 they
 convince


themselves
 because
 it's
 a
 lot
 more


powerful
 uh
 but
 if
 you
 practice
 that
 I


think
 you
 you
 you
 realize
 that
 this
 is


powerful
 and
 and
 maybe
 over
 time
 you
 get


better
 at
 it
 but
 this
 for
 me
 is
 very


very
 important
 what
 is
 driving
 you


personally
 uh
 I
 think
 you
 know
 if
 you
 if


you
 are
 to
 go
 really
 deep


psychologically
 uh
 I
 I
 think
 solving


problem
 I
 think
 you
 know
 I
 I
 always
 say


if
 I
 look
 at
 the
 different
 uh
 job
 I
 had


in
 my
 career
 I
 think
 they
 have
 this
 they


have
 a
 few
 common
 points
 solving
 problem


is
 one
 of
 them
 so
 if
 you're
 an
 engineer


you
 know
 you
 have
 a
 a
 problem
 you
 look


at


data
 and
 then
 you
 come
 to
 a
 solution
 I


think
 the
 the
 same
 still
 true
 if
 you're


a
 CEO
 of
 course
 the
 problem
 is
 a
 bit


different
 you
 look
 at
 the
 problem
 is


mostly
 what
 what
 does
 this
 industry
 need


in
 the
 next
 five


years
 uh
 second
 problem
 is
 how
 do
 we


make
 it
 happen
 third
 problem
 is
 how
 do


we
 found
 it
 etc
 etc
 but
 these
 are
 still


problem
 you
 have
 to
 solve
 and
 I
 think


you
 have
 to
 make
 the
 problem
 again


simple
 so
 that
 you
 can
 have
 a
 solution


if
 you
 think
 the
 problem
 is
 complex
 you


will
 never
 solve
 it
 right
 that's
 the
 way


it
 works
 so
 solving
 problem
 drives
 me
 I


think
 the
 contact
 with
 people
 is
 is
 a


major
 driver
 I
 you
 know
 I
 feel
 blessed


in
 this
 industry
 I
 mean
 everyone
 you


meet
 is
 is
 just
 inspiring
 I
 mean
 you
 you


go
 have
 a
 talk
 a
 dinner
 or
 a
 meeting


with
 anyone
 in
 the
 semiconductor


industry
 it's
 just
 a
 blast
 because


people
 have
 great
 experience
 they
 they


are
 pretty
 humble
 I
 think
 they
 share


this
 need
 to
 bring
 something
 positive


and
 again
 maybe
 this
 need
 to
 solve


problems
 together
 and
 I
 think
 the


connection
 to
 people
 has
 been
 always
 a


very
 very
 very
 motivating
 factor
 in
 uh


in
 in
 my
 career
 still
 today
 and
 you
 know


the
 last
 thing
 I
 would
 say
 is
 I
 enjoy


what
 I
 do
 very
 much
 so
 I
 I
 take
 really


great
 pleasure
 in
 uh
 in
 doing
 what
 I
 do


in
 SML
 and
 you
 know
 this
 is
 true
 today


but
 it's
 been
 true
 for
 the
 last
 25
 years


in
 this
 inury
 there's
 not
 been
 one


boring
 day


[Laughter]


good
 for
 you
 uh
 so
 Kristof
 if
 you
 were


to
 to
 go
 a
 bit
 deep
 um
 why
 do
 you
 work


so
 hard
 is
 it
 uh
 a
 particular
 person
 you


want
 to
 you
 want
 to
 prove
 wrong
 or
 you


know
 does
 it
 does
 it
 come
 back
 to
 some


type
 of
 inferiority
 complex
 that
 we
 all


had
 when
 we
 were
 younger
 or
 what
 do
 you


think
 no
 there
 is
 a
 time
 in
 your
 career


I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 be
 honest
 I
 think


the
 first
 part
 of
 your
 career
 is
 about


proving
 yourself
 I
 I
 think
 I
 truly


believe
 that
 and
 I
 truly
 believe
 that


because
 I
 I
 I
 still
 remember
 the
 day
 I


felt
 I
 was
 done
 with
 that
 there
 was
 a


day
 I
 say
 okay
 I
 think
 I
 have
 proven


what
 I
 wanted
 to
 prove
 to
 myself
 maybe


to
 my
 friends
 my
 family
 and
 then
 you


look
 forward
 you
 say
 okay
 what's
 next


and
 I
 think
 what's
 next
 after
 that
 is


okay
 what
 what
 can
 I
 do
 to
 help
 and
 you


know
 where
 is
 the
 place
 where
 I
 can
 do


something
 that
 that
 matters
 that
 can


really


help
 and
 you
 know
 when
 I
 became
 the
 CEO


of
 SML
 when
 people
 asked
 me
 to
 become


the
 CEO
 of
 SML
 this
 this
 was
 one
 of
 the


two
 question
 I
 really
 had
 the
 the


question
 was
 really
 if
 I'm
 going
 to
 do


that
 can
 I
 really
 bring
 something
 this


company
 is
 great
 you
 know
 with
 Peter


Martin
 before
 they
 have
 done
 something


extraordinary
 even
 intimidating
 for
 most


people
 so
 if
 I
 do
 it
 am
 I
 going
 to
 do


something
 that
 could
 be
 you
 know
 really


good
 and
 it
 was
 very
 important
 for
 me
 to


to
 be
 able
 to
 answer
 yes
 to
 that


question
 in
 all
 h
 y
 you
 know
 not
 uh
 but


very
 fundamentally
 I
 think
 it's
 for
 me


that
 when
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 prove


anything
 anymore
 I
 think
 it's
 very


liberating
 so
 I
 wish
 everyone
 that
 this


come
 as
 early
 as
 possible
 in
 their


career
 and
 then
 you
 have
 more
 space


basically
 to
 really
 think
 about
 what
 can


I
 do
 to
 be
 useful
 or
 what
 can
 I
 do
 to
 to


help
 tell
 me
 about
 the
 day
 where
 you


felt
 you
 had
 no
 more
 to
 prove
 well
 it


was
 you
 know
 I
 always
 wanted
 to
 uh


either
 run
 my
 company
 or
 or
 or
 run
 what


I
 would
 call
 a
 company
 within
 a
 company


and
 this
 happened
 in
 ASL
 in
 fact
 when
 I


took
 one
 of
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the
 product


unit
 this
 was
 the
 application
 product


unit
 which
 was
 a
 very
 new
 uh
 uh
 unit
 uh


I'm
 Looking
 Back
 Now
 2011
 or
 12
 I
 forgot


exactly
 so
 more
 than
 10
 years
 ago
 and


and
 this
 this
 was
 really
 what
 I
 wanted
 I


never
 wanted
 to
 become
 CEO
 I
 never


wanted
 to
 be
 part
 of
 a
 board
 of


management
 I
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 that
 and


then
 I
 had
 it
 I
 did
 it
 and
 it
 went
 well


and
 then
 I
 I
 I
 after
 that
 most
 probably


I
 was
 more
 free
 than
 ever
 and
 I
 think
 in


many
 way
 this
 most
 probably
 what
 also


allowed
 me
 to
 to
 come
 to
 to
 where
 I
 am


today
 how
 do
 you
 relax
 well
 I
 don't
 get


stress
 so
 that's
 the
 best
 way
 to
 relax


is
 you
 know
 I
 was
 just
 explaining
 to
 one


of
 my
 employee
 today
 that
 uh
 you
 know


stress
 is
 not
 a
 good
 friend
 so
 I
 I'm
 you


know
 it's
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 if
 this
 is


surprising
 or
 not
 but
 I
 don't
 feel


stress
 even
 being
 a
 ASMR
 CEO
 so
 that's


one
 thing
 and
 when
 I
 want
 to
 do


something
 that
 I
 really
 like
 you
 know
 uh


I
 I
 I
 I
 like
 to
 go
 to
 the
 Opera
 that's


one
 thing
 I
 like
 I
 like
 music
 a
 lot
 so


you
 know
 I
 put
 it's
 nice
 things
 with


technology
 nowadays
 you
 put
 the
 airport


and
 you
 can
 be
 in
 your
 uh
 in
 your
 world


with
 your
 music
 I
 likees
 to
 do
 that
 a


lot
 uh
 I
 like
 to
 sport
 when
 I
 have
 a


time
 I
 love
 to
 be
 with
 my
 family
 with


the
 kids
 because
 the
 you
 know
 what
 is


nice
 with
 children
 is
 they
 they
 force


you
 to
 forget
 everything
 uh
 simple


things
 I
 would
 say
 very
 very
 simple


things
 uh
 I
 I
 find
 them
 very
 healthy
 and


by
 having
 them
 all
 the
 time
 for
 me
 I


think
 you
 know
 it
 never
 bring
 me
 to
 to


to
 a
 place
 where
 I
 feel
 stressed
 how
 do


you
 make
 sure
 you
 don't
 get
 stressed
 is


it
 genetic
 or
 is
 it
 something
 you
 have


trained
 I
 think
 most
 probably
 something


I
 have
 trained
 because
 well
 I
 don't
 I


would
 not
 say
 my
 parents
 were
 not


stressed
 so
 I
 think
 most
 something
 I've


trained
 maybe
 also
 as
 a
 reaction
 to
 that


but
 uh
 I
 I
 like
 you
 know
 when
 I
 need
 to


think
 when
 I
 need
 to
 decide
 I
 I
 like
 to


feel
 that
 I'm
 calm
 uh
 I
 I
 I
 feel
 that


usually
 it's
 a
 much
 better
 State
 of
 Mind


basically
 to
 to
 make
 decision
 so
 I
 think


it's
 practice
 you
 know
 some
 people
 do


yoga
 or
 things
 like
 that
 to
 reach
 that
 I


don't
 do
 that
 but
 that's
 that's
 more
 in


a
 I
 notice
 breathing
 is
 very
 important


you
 know
 the
 way
 you
 breathe
 in
 life
 is


very
 important
 I
 I
 always
 tell
 people


when
 you're
 going
 to
 make
 a
 big


presentation
 you
 have
 to
 watch
 the
 way


you
 are
 going
 to
 breathe
 for
 the
 first


30
 seconds
 because
 if
 you
 if
 you
 breathe


too
 fast
 then
 your
 your
 uh
 presentation


will
 go
 wrong
 very
 quickly
 so
 you
 have


little
 things
 like
 that
 but
 uh
 I
 think


it's
 it's
 practice
 most
 probably
 when
 do


you
 go
 to
 bed
 and
 when
 you
 wake
 up
 well


that
 depends
 uh
 entirely
 uh
 I
 would
 say


uh
 you
 know
 in
 in
 normal
 uh
 Day
 meaning


when
 I'm
 at
 home
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 would


say
 I'll
 sleep
 seven
 hours
 maybe
 six


seven
 hours
 uh
 when
 I
 travel
 uh
 that
 can


go
 down
 to
 3
 four
 hours
 and
 that
 doesn't


disturb
 me
 so
 you
 know
 the
 energy
 level


my
 energy
 level
 is
 usually
 pretty
 high


and
 I
 need
 to
 rest
 you
 know
 usually


short
 time
 so
 some
 sometime
 I
 can
 fall


asleep
 in
 a
 car
 it's
 happened
 very
 often


between
 the
 meetings
 and
 10
 minutes
 can


get
 me
 back
 to
 uh
 to
 the
 max
 energy


level
 so
 you
 know
 it's
 one
 of
 the


challenges
 I
 think
 with
 this
 life
 and
 I


think
 physically
 you
 have
 to
 to
 be
 able


to
 take
 it
 but
 you
 you
 don't
 have
 a


rhythm
 you
 have
 to
 learn
 to
 live
 without


you
 know
 a
 rhythm
 because
 if
 you
 want
 to


have
 a
 rhythm
 I
 think
 it's
 complet
 C
 so


you
 have
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 sleep
 in
 the


plane
 sleep
 in
 the
 car
 all
 those
 things


are
 important
 where
 does
 energy
 come


from
 you
 think
 I
 think
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it


comes
 to
 to
 what
 I
 said
 before
 I
 mean


you
 know
 doing
 what
 I
 do
 today
 is
 uh
 is


an
 unbelievable
 PR
 privilege
 I
 mean


being
 the
 CEO
 of
 ASL


is
 you
 know
 there's
 so
 many
 good


interesting
 exciting
 things
 happening


every
 day
 that
 the
 energy
 just
 flow
 you


know
 it's
 like
 coming
 from
 all
 parts
 I


told
 you
 about
 the
 people
 I
 meet
 I
 mean


every
 time
 I
 go
 see
 customers


suppliers
 the
 the
 discussion
 we
 have
 are


so
 so
 uh
 deep
 right
 so


exciting
 I
 mean
 we
 talk
 about
 so


exciting
 stuff
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 when
 you


grow
 as
 an
 engineer
 you
 know
 I
 study


science
 right
 and
 you
 work
 in
 a
 company


that
 pretty
 much
 allow
 you
 to
 do
 any
 of


your
 dream
 as
 long
 as
 they
 become
 a


product
 someone
 can
 use
 in
 a
 factory
 I


mean
 you
 know
 did
 we
 dream
 about


anything
 different
 when
 we
 were
 engineer


I
 I
 don't
 think
 so
 so
 that
 give
 you
 a


lot
 of
 energy
 what
 do
 you
 read
 I
 like
 to


read
 literature


ER
 you
 know
 novels
 because
 I
 I
 like
 to


to
 kind


of
 move
 away
 so
 if
 I
 have
 free
 time
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 read
 Business
 book
 I
 don't


like
 Business
 book
 sorry
 for
 anyone


writing
 them
 but
 I
 I
 don't
 find
 this


inspiring
 at
 all
 uh
 I
 like
 uh
 novels
 I


like
 people
 that
 create
 and
 that's
 what


you
 see
 in
 novels
 right
 has
 there
 been
 a


novel
 which
 has
 been
 particularly


important
 for
 you
 well
 I
 there
 a
 French


writer
 I
 like
 very
 much
 it's
 called
 uh


it's
 called
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 if
 you


know
 him
 and
 he
 wrote
 a
 book
 it's
 called


The
 Stranger
 he
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 very
 good


book
 I
 like
 also
 Andre
 malro
 so
 they
 are


contemporary
 writer
 uh
 I
 like
 the
 style


I
 like
 the
 the
 modernity
 of
 it
 and
 and


also
 the
 the
 creativity
 so
 it's
 very


interesting
 it's
 both
 creative
 but
 not


in
 a
 in
 a
 very
 obvious
 way
 like
 maybe


older
 uh
 literature
 I
 like
 his
 story


book
 also
 I
 like
 to
 read
 a
 lot


biography
 um
 because
 you
 you
 learn
 about


people
 life
 uh
 which
 sometime
 can
 be


also
 very
 uh
 inspiring
 so
 that's


typically
 the
 the
 kind
 of
 things
 I
 I


would
 read
 last
 question
 um
 what
 advice


do
 you
 have
 for
 young
 people
 well
 I


think
 you
 know
 is
 find
 something
 you


really
 like
 you
 know
 I
 think
 don't
 think


too
 much
 about
 your
 career
 I
 I
 I
 see
 too


many
 young
 people
 who
 come
 to
 see


me
 and
 they
 want
 to
 be
 CEO
 and
 they
 ask


me
 how
 do
 we
 become
 CEO
 and
 and
 I
 try
 to


explain
 them
 in
 the
 nicest
 possible
 way


that
 this
 is
 a
 this
 is
 almost
 an
 absurd


question
 this
 is
 not
 the
 right
 question


the
 right
 question
 is
 what
 am
 I
 going
 to


do
 tomorrow
 that
 really
 get
 me
 excited


that
 really
 bring
 the
 best
 out
 of
 me


because
 if
 you
 go
 and
 do
 that
 every
 day


yeah
 there
 may
 be
 a
 chance
 you
 become


CEO
 uh
 most
 probably
 a
 bigger
 chance


that
 you
 don't
 uh
 but
 you
 will
 equally


end
 up
 doing
 something
 that
 brings
 you


uh
 Joy
 energy


and
 most
 also
 bring
 that
 to
 the
 people


around
 you
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 very


important
 to
 enjoy
 the
 moment
 but
 really


find
 something
 you
 like
 I
 think
 it's


even
 start
 when
 you
 you
 you
 study
 you


you
 have
 to
 study
 something
 you
 like
 uh


of
 course
 I
 will
 advise
 them
 to
 to
 take


a
 look
 at
 this
 industry
 because
 I
 I
 I


think
 this
 is
 a
 great
 place
 but
 you
 know


I
 also
 don't
 know
 everything
 so
 I
 I
 I


will
 not
 limited
 to
 that
 but
 I
 think


it's
 very
 very
 important
 for
 them


to
 to
 not
 think
 too
 much
 I
 I
 you
 know


I
 think
 it's
 one
 uh
 problem
 when
 Society


get
 so
 smart
 over
 time
 right
 people


think
 too
 much
 I
 think
 you
 you
 have
 to


be
 able
 to
 enjoy
 the
 moment
 even
 if
 you


are
 very
 very
 smart
 well
 Christoph
 it's


very
 clear
 that
 you
 are
 enjoy
 enjoying


your
 job
 as
 Co
 of
 asml
 uh
 incredibly


important
 job
 and
 so
 please
 on
 behalf
 of


all
 of
 us
 uh
 keep
 shrinking
 those
 chips


so
 that
 the
 world
 can
 continue
 to
 move


forward
 we'll
 do
 our
 best
 wonderful
 big


thank
 you
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 n


oh
