Hey
 everybody,
 welcome
 back
 to
 the


channel.
 We
 are
 back
 on
 another
 episode


of
 the
 daily
 recap.
 Third
 day
 in
 a
 row


after
 the
 fivemonth
 hiatus
 and
 we
 are


back.
 I'm
 very
 happy
 that
 you
 guys
 are


enjoying
 this
 series
 as
 much
 as
 I
 enjoy


creating
 it.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.


Bent
 kind
 of
 said
 some
 stuff
 about
 China


today
 that
 got
 the
 markets
 a
 little


upset.
 We'll
 talk
 about
 that.
 Lots
 of


macro
 updates.
 Remember
 how
 I
 said


yesterday
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 more


stats
 on
 what
 happened
 last
 week
 on
 the


first
 3%
 down
 day
 for
 the
 S&P
 500
 in
 5


months?
 We
 got
 some
 stats
 and
 it's
 quite


incredible
 to
 look
 at.
 Uh
 and
 then


Amazon.
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit


about
 Amazon.
 I
 bought
 more
 Amazon,
 made


some
 portfolio
 moves
 today.
 We'll
 talk


about
 what
 I
 did,
 but
 I
 think
 there's


something
 to
 discuss
 in
 Amazon.
 Let's


get
 into
 it.
 All
 right.
 So,
 let's
 start


off
 with
 what
 happened
 with
 Bent.
 Uh


quite
 simply,
 I
 think
 what's
 happening


right
 now
 in
 the
 state
 of
 China
 versus


the
 US
 is
 that
 they
 are
 going
 back
 and


forth
 with
 each
 other.
 Now,
 why
 are
 they


going
 back
 and
 forth?
 They
 will
 be


meeting
 by
 they,
 I
 mean
 Xi
 and
 Trump.


that
 this
 was
 confirmed
 um
 two
 days
 ago


in
 South
 Korea
 and
 that
 meeting
 was


going
 to
 be
 a
 really
 important
 meeting


because
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 talking


about
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 things.
 We


still
 have
 not
 got
 a
 full
 official


official
 trade
 deal
 from
 China,
 the


United
 States
 yet
 and
 so
 we
 need
 to
 see


what
 happens
 in
 that
 meeting.
 Now
 you


had
 two
 statements
 today,
 one
 by
 Trump


and
 one
 by
 Bent
 that
 kind
 of
 got
 the


market
 a
 little
 scared.
 We
 were
 up
 about


1.2%
 1
 p.m.
 the
 statement
 comes
 out
 from


Bent
 Market
 falls
 about
 7%
 then
 we


recover
 about.3%.
 So,
 all
 in
 all,
 not
 a


flat
 day
 for
 the
 S&P
 500,
 but
 definitely


not
 a
 monster
 day
 in
 terms
 of
 the


rebound.
 We
 even
 touched
 670
 in
 the


morning.
 673
 was
 the
 all-time
 high.
 Uh,


I
 think
 we
 closed
 today
 around
 663.
 So,


what
 did
 say?
 He
 urged
 the
 World
 Bank
 to


end
 support
 for
 China,
 said
 securing


critical
 mineral
 supply
 chains
 is
 a
 US


priority,
 and
 pushed
 the
 bank
 to
 finance


reliable
 energy
 sources.
 Essentially,
 he


said,
 "Hey,
 we
 think
 there
 is
 a


decoupling
 going
 on
 between
 the
 United


States
 and
 China
 from
 a
 rare
 earth


perspective."
 and
 not
 just
 rare
 earths


but
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 things
 in
 regards
 to


the
 supply
 chain.
 The
 rare
 earth
 export


controls
 that
 China
 unleashed
 last
 week


as
 per
 Trump
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 started


this
 entire
 debacle
 in
 the
 first
 place.


And
 Bent
 was
 upset
 about
 it
 today.
 And


Bent
 made
 it
 known
 how
 much
 he's
 upset


about
 this
 today.
 If
 you
 looked
 at
 all


the
 rare
 earth
 stocks,
 US
 MP,
 TMQ,
 CRML,


LAC,
 they're
 all
 down
 on
 average
 about


15%
 on
 the
 day.
 In
 fact,
 AAB
 is
 not
 a


rare
 earth
 stock,
 but
 it's
 a
 battery


company.
 Uh
 they're
 down
 20%
 after
 hours


because
 they
 lost
 the
 grant
 from
 the


DOE.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 high-flying


names
 have
 kind
 of
 taken
 a
 little
 bit
 of


a
 breather
 today
 and
 it
 might
 mean
 quite


frankly
 that
 the
 sector
 in
 and
 of
 itself


is
 exhausted
 based
 on
 all
 the
 momentum


that
 they
 have
 had.
 Now,
 what
 did
 Trump


say?
 Trump
 said
 three
 things.
 He
 said


number
 one,
 we
 are
 in
 a
 trade
 war
 with


China.
 Number
 so
 definitively,
 he
 just


said
 that's
 the
 case.
 Number
 two,
 he


said
 India
 assured
 me
 they
 would
 stop


buying
 Russian
 oil.
 I
 I
 hope
 that's


true,
 but
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 India
 with


1.4
 billion
 people
 is
 actually
 going
 to


stop
 buying
 cheap
 oil
 from
 Russia.
 And


number
 three,
 he
 said
 five
 or
 six
 of
 my


wars
 or
 five
 or
 six
 of
 wars
 globally


have
 been
 solved
 because
 of
 tariffs.
 So


the
 point
 that
 Trump
 is
 trying
 to
 make


right
 here
 is
 bringing
 the
 tariff


conversation
 which
 we
 really
 haven't


heard
 about
 for
 the
 past
 three
 months
 to


be
 honest
 back
 into
 the
 mainstream.
 And


the
 reason
 he's
 doing
 this
 I
 think
 is


because
 he
 wants
 to
 get
 leverage
 with


China.
 Same
 thing
 for
 why
 Bent
 said
 what


he
 said
 today.
 What's
 the
 takeaway
 for


investors?
 I
 think
 the
 market
 reacted
 to


the
 news
 today
 in
 regards
 to
 China
 and


Trump,
 but
 they
 didn't
 react
 as


negatively
 as
 they
 reacted
 when
 the


soybean
 stuff
 came
 out
 yesterday,
 which


I
 didn't
 get
 to
 talk
 about
 because
 I


recorded
 the
 video
 before
 that
 happened.


It's
 almost
 like
 markets
 didn't
 even


care
 about
 soybeans
 today.
 Uh,
 and
 they


didn't
 react
 as
 badly
 as
 they
 reacted
 on


Friday
 when
 we
 had
 that
 3%
 draw
 down.


And
 I
 think
 it's
 because
 the
 markets
 are


just
 accepting
 that
 China
 and
 the
 US
 are


going
 to
 go
 back
 and
 forth
 with
 each


other.
 Unless
 it
 escalates
 to
 some


dramatic
 effect
 like
 we
 had
 back
 in


April
 when
 they
 were
 both
 threatening


150%
 tariffs
 against
 each
 other
 then


it's
 likely
 going
 to
 be
 resolved
 and
 the


meeting
 in
 South
 Korea
 next
 week
 is
 very


important.
 But
 stocks
 were
 relatively


flat
 to
 green
 today
 based
 on
 the
 idea


that
 hey
 maybe
 this
 doesn't
 matter
 as


much.
 I
 mean
 HIMS
 had
 a
 monster
 move


today
 based
 on
 an
 update
 that
 was


specific
 to
 their
 HERS
 part
 of
 the


business.
 Uh
 and
 then
 AMD
 looks
 like
 it


had
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 rebound
 from
 the
 Oracle


GPU
 announcement
 that
 the
 macro
 kind
 of


killed
 yesterday
 in
 terms
 of
 that
 news


but
 it
 was
 a
 pretty
 bullish
 piece
 of


news.
 So
 you
 had
 individual
 stocks
 that


went
 up
 10
 15%
 today
 that
 had
 nothing
 to


do
 with
 China
 and
 overall
 I
 think


probably
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 the


market
 doesn't
 care
 that
 much
 about


China
 as
 long
 as
 it
 doesn't
 escalate
 to


the
 extent
 that
 we
 thought
 it
 could
 have


escalated
 on
 Friday
 and
 as
 a
 result


hopefully
 stocks
 are
 higher
 by
 the
 end


of the
 year
 because
 the
 China
 situation


is
 likely
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal.
 All


right
 next
 story
 of
 the
 day
 let's
 talk


about
 some
 stats.
 I
 think
 this
 stat
 was


one
 of the
 most
 important
 stats
 we
 saw


today
 based
 on
 what
 happened
 last
 week


in
 regards
 to
 the
 3%
 draw
 down
 on
 the


S&P
 500.
 Actually,
 before
 I
 give
 you


guys
 that
 stat,
 let
 me
 actually
 give
 you


this
 real
 quick.
 Um,
 there
 is
 a
 company


out
 there
 that
 on
 December
 29th,
 this
 is


a
 company
 that
 makes
 ETFs,
 uh,
 is
 coming


out
 with
 5x


leveraged
 ETFs.
 Meaning,
 you
 can
 buy
 a


Palanteer
 leverage
 ETF,
 you
 can
 buy
 an


Nvidia
 leverage
 ETF,
 Google,
 Circle,


Coinbase,
 XRP,
 Salana,
 Ether,
 Bitcoin,


AMD,
 Amazon
 by
 Volatility
 Shares,
 name


of
 the
 company.
 They're
 putting
 that


out.
 That's
 going
 to
 be
 happening


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 Uh,
 I


personally
 will
 likely
 not
 touch
 this


stuff
 because
 it
 is
 very
 volatile.
 That


means
 if
 AMD
 falls
 10%
 in
 a
 day,
 this


ETF
 will
 fall
 50%
 in
 a
 day.
 Pretty


aggressive,
 but
 nonetheless,
 that's
 kind


of
 the
 nature
 of
 this
 market.
 That's
 the


nature
 of
 these
 products.
 And
 if
 these


products
 continue
 to
 get
 it
 bought
 up,


that
 there
 will
 be
 a
 market
 for
 those


that
 supply
 these
 products.
 Now,
 why
 do


the
 suppliers
 of
 these
 products
 continue


to
 supply
 them?
 Well,
 here's
 the
 stat


that
 I
 think
 is
 quite
 incredible
 to


hear.
 Last
 week


was
 a
 record
 week
 for
 stock
 market


inflows.
 So,
 two
 levels
 to
 this.
 It
 was


the
 fifth
 largest
 in
 history,
 bar
 none.


Fifth
 largest
 in
 history
 for
 stock


market
 inflows
 last
 week
 is
 from
 Bank
 of


America
 research.
 It
 was
 the
 biggest


ever
 for
 a
 week
 if
 the
 market
 was
 down


at
 least
 1%.
 Markets
 down
 at
 least
 1%.


It
 was
 the
 biggest
 week
 ever
 of
 inflows.


Uh
 and
 overall
 it
 was
 the
 fifth
 largest


single
 stock
 inflows
 in
 history.
 This
 is


retail
 and
 institutional.
 Now
 we
 looked


at
 a
 stat
 yesterday
 about
 equity
 call


options.
 61
 million
 on
 Friday,
 41


million
 put
 options.
 we
 had
 108
 million


which
 was
 quite
 incredible
 to
 see
 that


much
 uh
 level
 of
 option
 buying
 in
 the


stock
 market
 on
 a
 3%
 down
 day.
 I
 think


that
 combined
 with
 this
 research
 that
 is


showing
 how
 much
 money
 entered
 in
 the


market
 institutional
 or
 retail
 just
 goes


to
 show
 we're
 in
 a
 buy
 the
 dip
 market


and
 maybe
 one
 day
 we
 won't
 be
 in
 a
 buy


the
 dip
 market.
 Maybe
 next
 year
 it's


going to
 be
 a
 different
 type
 of
 year.


Maybe
 earnings
 are
 not
 going to
 be
 that


good.
 But
 by
 the
 way,
 Morgan
 Stanley


crushed
 it
 this
 morning.
 Bank
 of
 America


crushed
 it
 this
 morning.
 United
 had


their
 best
 earnings
 ever.
 they
 guided


for
 their
 best
 operating
 income
 in
 the


history
 of
 being
 a
 public
 company
 for


Q4.
 I
 mean,
 earnings
 are
 crushing
 it.
 It


makes
 me
 pretty
 optimistic
 for
 what


we're
 going
 to
 get
 from
 tech
 earnings


given
 how
 the
 banks
 have
 done.
 But
 it's


a
 buy
 the
 dip
 market
 and
 uh
 look,
 if


you've
 been
 buying
 the
 dip,
 you've
 been


rewarded
 for
 it.
 But
 the
 fact
 that
 this


level
 of
 buying
 the
 dip
 is
 happening
 is


something
 that
 I've
 never
 seen
 before.


And
 quite
 frankly,
 it's
 phenomenal
 to


live
 through
 it.
 So
 last
 week,
 3%
 draw


down,
 one
 of the
 worst
 days
 for
 the
 S&P


500
 in
 5
 months.
 markets
 did
 not
 care.


Retail
 investors
 definitely
 did
 not
 care


and
 people
 bought
 the
 dip.
 All right,


let's
 talk
 about
 Amazon
 and
 what's
 going


on
 with
 Amazon.
 So,
 I've
 been
 building
 a


position
 in
 Amazon
 and
 originally
 I


thought
 of
 it
 as
 a
 trade.
 The
 simple


thesis
 was,
 hey,
 this
 stock
 is
 barely
 up


year
 to
 date.
 Although
 their
 Mac
 7s
 are


up,
 I'm
 in
 at
 220.
 I
 like
 it
 at
 260.
 I


think
 it
 can
 make
 a
 move
 by
 the
 end
 of


the
 year.
 The
 more
 I've
 started
 to


research
 Amazon,
 the
 more
 I've
 started


to
 do
 due
 diligence
 on
 the
 company,
 the


more
 I've
 started
 to
 realize
 how
 I
 think


underpriced
 it
 is
 against
 the


opportunity
 of
 the
 stock,
 the
 more
 it
 is


becoming
 a
 long-term
 position
 and


essentially
 a
 cornerstone
 of
 the


portfolio,
 which
 look,
 it's
 not
 that


hard
 of
 a
 cell
 to
 make
 a
 Amazon
 a


cornerstone
 of
 a
 portfolio.
 For
 those


that
 don't
 understand
 the
 cornerstone


concept,
 this
 is
 something
 I
 learned
 a


couple
 years
 ago.
 You
 want
 to
 have
 two


to
 three
 stocks
 realistically.
 Like
 I


think
 max
 is
 five
 pushing
 above
 five
 is


pushing
 it
 but
 usually
 the
 sweet
 spot
 is


two
 to
 three
 that
 becomes
 a
 cornerstone


of
 the
 portfolio.
 What
 are
 two
 to
 three


names
 that
 you
 can
 DCA
 in
 at
 any
 price


that
 you
 can
 hold
 on
 to
 at
 any
 price


that
 you
 have
 such
 unbelievable


conviction
 in
 that
 the
 worst
 thing
 could


happen
 and
 you're
 probably
 not
 going
 to


sell.
 They
 can
 sell
 options
 against
 that


you
 can
 potentially
 sell
 if
 you
 needed


to
 do
 something
 because
 you
 know
 the


right
 movements
 of
 the
 technical
 layers


of
 the
 stock
 if
 you
 really
 understand


those
 companies
 so
 well
 and
 then
 you
 can


get
 back
 in.
 like
 what
 are
 those
 two
 to


three
 names
 of
 your
 portfolio?
 For
 me,


it's
 pretty
 obvious.
 Robin
 and
 Pounder,


uh
 I
 think
 I
 know
 those
 companies
 pretty


well
 and
 as
 a
 result,
 I've
 been
 able
 to


build
 positions
 in
 those
 companies
 and
 I


want
 to
 hold
 them
 for
 a
 long
 time.


Nvidia,
 ironically,
 has
 become
 the
 third


one
 and
 I
 thought
 Nvidia
 was
 not
 even
 a


company
 worth
 investing
 in
 in
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 year.
 Then
 Deepc


happened,
 really
 did
 some
 due
 diligence


and
 now
 it's
 become
 a
 substantial
 part


of
 the
 portfolio.
 So
 Nvidia
 hood
 and


poutier
 I
 can
 see
 myself
 for
 the
 next


five
 years
 not
 worrying
 about
 owning


pounder
 hood
 or
 Nvidia
 simply
 because


they
 are
 the
 cornerstones
 of
 the


portfolio.
 So,
 what
 can
 become
 a


cornerstone
 portfolio
 stock?
 Two


categories.
 It's
 either
 a
 stock
 you're


super
 early
 in
 and
 therefore
 even
 if
 it


falls
 50%,
 you're
 still
 up
 so
 much
 that


the
 margin
 of
 safety
 is
 so
 high.
 Uh,


Hood
 and
 Pounder
 are
 those
 for
 me.
 Or


number
 two,
 it's
 a
 really
 good
 high


quality
 company.
 Like,
 it's
 a
 freaking


phenomenal
 company
 where
 you
 can
 sleep


well
 at
 night
 knowing
 all
 the
 financial


obligations
 you
 have
 in
 life
 won't


necessarily
 go
 to
 if
 the
 company


goes
 to
 because
 you're
 holding
 on


to
 something
 special.
 It's
 a
 sleep
 well


at
 night
 stock,
 a
 swan
 stock.
 That
 to
 me


is
 Amazon.
 And
 Amazon
 continues
 to
 be


disrespected
 by
 the
 street.
 Couple
 stats


for
 you.
 And
 this
 uh
 stats,
 I'm
 pulling


some
 of
 this
 from
 our
 boy
 Austin.
 I'm


going
 to
 leave
 his
 Twitter
 thread
 in
 the


chat.
 I
 would
 definitely
 recommend


people
 following
 him
 because
 he
 did
 some


really
 good
 writeups
 on
 Amazon
 today.


Take
 a
 listen
 to
 this.
 Amazon's
 backlog


for
 AWS
 is
 now
 195
 billion
 on
 top
 of


their
 existing
 160
 billion
 ARR.


The
 $17.5
 billion
 increase
 in
 growth


from
 June
 24
 to
 currently
 right
 now
 in


2025,
 98.5
 billion
 to
 116
 billion
 is


onethird
 of
 Google
 Cloud's
 entire
 run


rate.
 One
 of
 the
 reasons
 why
 Amazon's


getting
 discounted
 is
 because
 AWS
 is
 not


growing
 as
 fast
 as
 GCP
 or
 Azure.
 Okay,


fair
 critique.
 The
 problem
 is
 they
 are


growing
 the
 net
 dollars
 way
 more
 in


volume
 and
 size
 than
 Google
 and
 than


Google
 and
 Microsoft.
 That's
 not


necessarily
 a
 reason
 to
 say
 it's
 a


better
 stock,
 but
 that
 is
 to
 say,
 dude,


this
 is
 a
 massive
 business
 that
 is
 not


slowing
 down.
 If
 anything,
 they
 can


create
 operating
 leverage
 on
 top
 of
 that


business
 to
 make
 their
 margins
 better.


Right
 now,
 their
 margins
 are
 36%.
 Those


margins
 go
 to
 37
 38%.
 We're
 talking


about
 tens
 of
 billions
 of
 an
 increase
 in


net
 income
 per
 year,
 which,
 you
 know,
 if


a
 PE
 is
 based
 on
 the
 E
 and
 the
 E
 goes
 up


because
 the
 net
 income
 goes
 up
 because


the
 margins
 go
 up,
 that
 earnings


multiple
 should
 expand
 and
 that
 should


be
 very
 good
 for
 Amazon.
 61
 billion
 of


what
 they
 do
 is
 advertising.
 I
 mean,
 I


don't
 even
 think
 about
 the
 Amazon


advertising
 business,
 but
 obviously
 it's


massive
 because
 they
 have
 all
 the
 data


and
 that's
 growing
 20%.
 That's
 also
 a


high
 margin
 business.
 And
 then
 finally,


this
 stat
 I
 think
 is
 one
 of the
 most


important
 stats
 to
 recognize.
 Amazon's


EV
 to
 Ebida
 multiple
 is
 trading
 at
 the


lowest
 enterprise
 value
 over
 Ebida
 in


history.
 Okay,
 so
 that's
 the
 first


thing.
 Second
 thing
 is
 the
 average
 EV
 to


Ebida
 for
 the
 MAG
 7
 right
 now,
 the
 other


six
 companies
 in
 the
 MAG
 7
 39.3.
 Amazon


17.3.
 It's
 a
 56%
 discount.
 I'm
 not


trying
 to
 pound
 the
 table
 and
 say
 Amazon


is
 the
 biggest
 buy
 in
 the
 market
 right


now.
 In
 fact,
 Amazon
 it
 could
 be
 flat


throughout
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 I'm


saying
 if
 you
 have
 done
 very
 well
 this


year
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 and
 you've


taken
 the
 risk
 on
 betting
 on
 names
 that


are
 super
 speculative
 but
 that
 have


growth
 trajectory
 and
 you
 held
 on
 you


DCA
 you
 bought
 in
 April
 it
 is
 not
 insane


or
 crazy
 to
 say
 rotating
 some
 of
 that


money
 or
 even
 the
 dry
 powder
 that
 you


have
 into
 something
 that's
 not
 flying


five
 or
 six%
 every
 day
 so
 you're
 not


getting
 the
 dopamine
 hit
 of
 those
 stocks


moving
 as
 green
 as
 they
 are
 but
 you're


buying
 something
 that
 is
 undervalued
 to


its
 peers.
 Is
 it
 underv
 valued
 overall?


I
 mean
 that
 they're
 going to
 have
 to
 put


up
 really
 good
 earnings
 for
 us
 to
 be


able
 to
 make
 that
 discussion.
 I
 think


based
 on
 the
 earnings
 we've
 seen
 on
 a


trailing
 12
 month
 basis,
 the
 answer
 to


that
 is
 correct.
 But
 you're
 buying


Amazon.
 Amazon
 goes
 down
 10%.
 Okay,


you're
 bag
 holding
 Amazon.
 You're
 not


bag
 holding
 quantum
 nuclear
 mechanics.


You're
 bag
 holding
 Amazon.


It's
 a
 buy
 for
 me.
 I
 think
 it's
 one
 of


the
 more
 compelling
 opportunities
 in
 the


market.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 I'm
 buying
 more


Amazon.
 And
 this
 is
 not
 to
 persuade


other
 people
 to
 buy
 more
 Amazon.
 It's


just,
 hey,
 looking
 in
 this
 market
 that's


super
 frothy,
 that
 has
 a
 bunch
 of
 names


that
 are
 running
 like
 crazy.
 There's
 a


bad
 narrative
 around
 Amazon
 for
 a


variety
 of
 reasons.
 Narratives
 fade.
 We


saw
 what
 happened
 with
 Google
 150
 to
 250


because
 the
 DOJ
 narrative,
 the
 search
 is


dead
 narrative
 went
 away.
 If
 that


happens
 with
 Amazon,
 I
 think
 this
 is


closer
 to
 $300
 stock
 and
 as
 a
 result,
 I


continue
 to
 buy
 more.
 All
 right,
 next
 up


is
 Nvidia
 and
 more
 on
 what's
 going
 on


with
 the
 world
 of
 data
 centers.
 So,


Nvidia
 got
 a
 price
 target
 upgrade
 today


to
 320.
 This
 is
 a
 street
 high
 price


target
 on
 Nvidia.
 uh
 300
 from
 Caner
 last


week
 was
 the
 street
 high
 and
 now
 320
 is


the
 new
 street
 high
 from
 HSBC.


Uh
 what
 did
 they
 say?
 Well,
 they


increased
 their
 earnings
 estimates.
 We


upgrade
 Nvidia
 to
 buy
 on
 the
 back
 of


increasing
 fiscal
 year
 2027
 GPU
 total


addressable
 market
 relative
 to
 our


previous
 expectations
 leading
 to
 an


upward
 revision
 in
 our
 fiscal
 year
 2027


data
 center
 revenues
 to
 $351
 billion


36%
 above
 the
 consensus
 forecast
 of
 258


billion.
 Now,
 Caner
 said
 Nvidia
 is
 going


to
 do
 $11
 of
 EPS
 by
 2027.
 If
 you
 combine


their
 EPS
 with
 HSBC's
 revenue
 target
 of


351
 billion
 in
 2027,
 that
 means
 they'd


be
 trading
 at
 a
 27
 times
 forward


earnings
 and
 a
 21
 times
 forward
 price
 of


sales.
 Both
 of
 those
 multiples
 are


cheaper
 than
 the
 stock
 today.
 I
 mean,
 I


don't
 know
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 another


company
 in
 history
 at
 this
 scale
 pull


off
 what
 Nvidia
 is
 doing
 where
 the
 stock


is
 going
 up,
 but
 because
 of
 the
 growth


in
 the
 company,
 even
 as
 the
 stock
 price


goes
 up,
 the
 multiple
 compresses,
 which


is
 really
 one
 of the
 most
 phenomenal


ways
 to
 invest
 in
 growth
 stocks
 because


you
 want
 to
 see
 the
 growth
 happen.
 You


want
 to
 see
 the
 market
 reward
 the


growth,
 but
 you
 don't
 want
 to see
 the


multiple
 to
 get
 egregious.
 Uh
 because


obviously
 the
 growth
 should
 offset
 the


expansion
 in
 the
 multiple.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 I
 mean,
 it
 has
 just
 been
 one
 of


the
 most
 phenomenal
 things
 to
 see
 for


Nvidia.
 That
 would
 put
 them,
 by
 the
 way,


at
 a
 $7.8
 trillion
 market
 cap
 if
 we
 get


to
 that
 $320
 level.
 Now,
 uh
 AMD
 was
 up


today,
 and
 I
 think
 AMD
 was
 up
 based
 on


that
 Oracle
 partnership
 that
 was


announced
 yesterday.
 There
 was
 no
 other


headline,
 but
 AMD
 closed
 at
 around
 that


238,
 239
 level.
 The
 other
 big
 headline


today
 in
 the
 data
 center
 space
 is
 that


Nvidia
 now
 partnered
 with
 Black
 Rockck.


They
 partnered
 with
 BlackRock
 uh
 and
 a


UAE
 investment
 firm.
 And
 the
 idea
 of
 the


investment
 firm
 is
 essentially
 it's
 a


they're
 they're
 acquiring
 a
 company
 for


$40
 billion.
 And
 the
 acquisition
 of
 this


$40
 billion
 company
 is
 essentially
 to


continue
 building
 more
 data
 centers.


Now,
 this
 was
 a
 really
 important


acquisition
 for
 me
 to
 see
 because


basically
 Nvidia
 is
 saying,
 "Hey,
 we


have
 so
 much
 money."
 They're
 not


spending
 the
 entire
 $40
 billion


themselves.
 They're
 partnering
 with


other
 companies,
 but
 the
 reason
 they're


spending
 this
 money
 is
 because
 they


realize
 that
 the
 best
 place
 they
 could


allocate
 this
 money
 to,
 which
 is
 what


Jensen
 has
 been
 saying
 for
 a
 long
 time,


is
 more
 data
 center
 capacity.
 So,
 Nvidia


and
 Black
 Rockck
 teaming
 up
 on
 a
 40


billion
 acquisition
 of
 a
 major
 global


data
 center
 firm.
 Uh
 this
 implies


roughly
 8
 million
 per
 megawatt
 of
 total


data
 center
 capacity
 and
 as
 a
 result
 one


of
 the
 reasons
 why
 this
 was
 also
 excited


MGX
 was
 the
 AI
 investment
 firm
 as
 well


by
 the
 sovereign
 wealth
 fund
 in
 the
 UAE.


Microsoft
 is
 also
 going
 to
 be
 included


in
 this
 deal.
 The
 reason
 this
 was


excited
 for
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners
 today


that
 are
 now
 these
 data
 center
 plays
 is


because
 IN
 cipher
 terowolf
 bit
 farms


which
 raised
 300
 million
 in
 a


convertible
 note
 after
 hours
 the
 stock


was
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 but
 market
 didn't


care
 too
 much.
 Nebius,
 Cororeweave,


there
 was
 a
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 headline


today
 that
 Cororeweave
 is
 going to
 be


establishing
 a
 data
 center
 in
 Texas


today.
 All
 of
 those
 stocks
 got
 a
 boost.


Some
 of
 them
 ended
 red,
 most
 of
 them


ended
 green
 for
 the
 day
 because
 of
 this


idea
 that
 wait
 a
 second,
 Black
 Rockck,


Nvidia,
 Microsoft
 along
 with
 the
 UAE


rolling
 up
 together
 and
 saying,
 "Hey,


we're
 ready
 to
 spend
 40
 billion
 more
 on


data
 centers."
 Obviously,
 the
 leasing


capacity
 of
 those
 data
 centers
 is
 likely


going
 to
 involve
 more
 of
 the


hyperscalers
 and
 some
 of the
 smaller


players,
 and
 that's
 why
 those
 companies


continue
 to
 get
 a
 bid.
 Now,
 are
 those


companies
 the
 most
 quality
 companies?
 I


don't
 know.
 It
 really
 depends
 on
 your


own
 due
 diligence.
 But
 are
 they
 in
 a


trend
 where
 this
 where
 the
 secular
 theme


is
 continuing
 to
 increase
 its
 momentum?


Yes.
 The
 question
 becomes,
 are
 those


stocks
 good
 buys
 from
 a
 valuation


perspective,
 fundamental
 perspective,


and
 that's
 subjective.
 But
 overall,


doesn't
 look
 like
 this
 theme
 for
 data


centers
 is
 going
 away
 anywhere.
 All


right.
 Last
 thing
 we'll
 talk
 about
 today


is
 gold.
 Now,
 I
 thought
 this
 stat
 was


also
 really
 important
 in
 the
 context
 of


gold.
 By
 the
 way,
 gold
 4,200.


I
 mean,
 just
 incredible.
 Silver
 53.


Look,
 let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you're


or
 in
 the
 chat
 in
 the
 comments.
 This
 is


a
 video.
 Um,
 let
 me
 know
 if
 you're
 long


gold
 or
 silver.
 I
 I
 have
 this
 as
 my


allocation
 for
 gold.
 It's
 one
 of
 the


first
 ever
 Robin
 Hood
 gold
 credit
 cards.


It's
 not
 even
 a
 real
 credit
 card,
 but


it's
 one
 of
 the
 prototypes
 I
 have.
 So,


this
 is
 real
 gold.
 I
 got
 this
 at
 when


when
 gold
 was
 trading
 at
 like
 2200.
 So,


this
 has
 appreciated,
 but
 I
 don't


actually
 own
 gold.
 It's
 not
 been


something
 that
 I've
 been
 into.
 But
 some


of
 these
 stats
 are
 crazy.
 So,
 I
 mean,


take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 Um,
 fund
 managers


from
 Bank
 of
 America's
 survey
 that
 have


over
 400
 billion
 in
 assets
 have
 said


gold
 is
 their
 crowdest
 trade.
 Long
 gold,


long
 mag
 7
 used
 to
 be
 the
 crowded
 trade


for
 three
 consecutive
 months.
 Long
 gold


has
 topped
 that.
 Second
 of
 all,
 the


average
 investor's
 allocation
 based
 on


the
 survey
 to
 gold
 is
 just
 2.4%
 near
 an


all-time
 low.
 Gold
 is
 up
 60%
 this
 year


and
 the
 average
 investor
 like
 myself
 and


probably
 a
 lot
 of
 retail
 investors
 don't


really
 own
 that
 gold.
 The
 allocation
 is


2.4%
 4%.
 Which
 begs
 to
 question,
 wait
 a


second,
 if
 the
 average
 investor
 starts


piling
 into
 gold,
 does
 gold
 have
 a
 lot


higher
 to
 run?
 And
 then
 if
 you
 pair
 this


stat
 with
 the
 allocation
 from
 Wall


Street
 to
 cryptocurrencies


and
 their
 allocation
 to
 crypto,
 which
 is


the
 whole
 digital
 gold
 thing,
 point4%.


So,
 Wall
 Street
 is
 allocated
 more
 to


gold
 than
 crypto,
 but
 the
 average


investor
 is
 barely
 allocated
 to
 gold.


And
 gold
 is
 up
 60%
 for
 the
 year.
 Bitcoin


is
 up
 20%
 for
 the
 year.
 The
 dollar
 is


down
 10%.
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the


run
 in
 commodities
 is
 telling
 us
 other


than
 based
 on
 what
 we
 talked
 about


yesterday,
 JPAL
 saying
 he's
 likely
 going


to
 get
 more
 into
 quantitative
 easing


versus
 quantitative
 tightening.
 You've


got
 Paul
 Tudtor
 Jones
 saying
 he
 thinks


the
 federal
 funds
 rate
 is
 going
 to
 be
 at


2
 and
 a
 half%
 by
 the
 end
 of
 next
 year.


When
 you
 have
 all
 of
 these
 elements
 of,


hey,
 money
 is
 going
 to
 get
 cheaper.
 The


value
 of
 money
 is
 going
 to
 start
 to
 come


down,
 which
 means
 you
 need
 to
 put
 that


money
 into
 other
 asset
 classes
 like
 a


Bitcoin,
 like
 an
 S&P
 500,
 like
 a
 gold
 or


a
 silver.
 And
 then
 you
 have
 this


multi-year
 trend
 from
 a
 technical


perspective
 on
 gold
 and
 silver.
 Silver


actually
 breaking
 out
 of
 like
 a
 three
 to


four
 year
 base.
 It
 becomes
 pretty
 damn


silver.
 It's
 been
 like
 10
 years.
 It


becomes
 pretty
 damn
 incredible.
 So
 I


don't
 think
 the
 running
 commodities
 is


saying
 that
 you
 have
 to
 get
 out
 of


equities
 because
 the
 world
 is
 going
 to


 and
 like
 gold
 is
 going
 up
 so
 you


should
 sell
 everything.
 But
 I
 think
 it


is
 saying
 people
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 in


cash.
 They
 want
 to
 be
 in
 hard
 assets
 or


at least
 assets
 that
 are
 producing


something
 like
 stocks.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


that's
 why
 you're
 seeing
 the
 momentum
 in


gold
 and
 silver.
 All right,
 that's
 it


for
 me
 today.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for


joining.
 My
 Substack
 is
 launching
 on


Friday.
 Two
 deep
 dives
 will
 be
 out
 on


Friday.
 Super
 excited
 for
 it.
 It
 will
 be


free.
 No
 payw
 wall
 ever.
 Um
 hopefully


you
 guys
 will
 enjoy
 my
 long
 firm


research
 and
 uh
 like
 I
 really
 want
 to


start
 getting
 deeper
 into
 names
 that
 are


not
 just
 like
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 biggest


names
 that
 are
 out
 there.
 Smaller
 names


and
 do
 a
 lot
 more
 research
 on
 them.
 The


first
 two
 deep
 dives
 is
 going to
 be
 a


little
 bit
 more
 bigger
 names,
 but
 the


goal
 of
 the
 Substack,
 two
 editions
 uh


per
 month,
 um
 10
 to
 15
 pages
 each,
 so


about
 5,000
 words
 per
 substack,
 is
 to


really
 focus
 on
 trying
 to
 challenge


myself
 to
 be
 a
 better
 researcher.
 And


that's
 the
 goal.
 If
 I
 buy
 the
 stock
 that


I
 do
 a
 deep
 dive
 on,
 I'll
 disclose
 the


position,
 but
 overall,
 I
 just
 want
 to


become
 a
 better
 student
 of
 the
 game
 and


study
 more
 stocks.
 And
 I
 think
 this
 will


hold
 me
 accountable
 to
 doing
 that.

 you

 Thank
 you
 everybody
 so


much
 for
 supporting
 the
 daily
 recap


every
 single
 day.
 It
 really
 is
 so
 much


fun
 to
 do
 this.
 And
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys


tomorrow.
