[Music]


today
 we
 have
 a
 special
 bonus
 episode


with
 Andy
 Juke
 one
 of
 the
 best
 poker


players
 in
 the
 world
 bestselling
 author


and
 somebody
 I
 love
 to
 talk
 to
 she's
 got


really
 unique
 perspective
 on
 when
 to


fold
 your
 cards
 sell
 your
 shares
 and


dump
 your
 husband
 Annie
 thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 joining
 us


today
 h
 thank
 you
 I
 want
 to
 just
 clarify


I
 would
 not
 say
 I'm
 one
 of
 the
 best


poker
 players
 in
 the
 world
 anymore
 I
 did


retire
 in


2012
 that's
 all
 good
 now
 you
 wrote
 a


book
 called
 quit
 why
 is
 it
 so
 hard
 for


people
 to


quit
 oh
 gosh
 you
 know


it's
 I
 I
 think
 that
 the
 issue
 with


quitting
 is
 that
 there's
 just
 a
 lot
 of


cognitive
 biases
 that
 line


up
 and
 result
 in
 this
 failure
 to
 stop


things
 so
 it's
 hard
 to
 pinpoint
 one


thing
 right
 so
 we
 know
 that
 we
 have
 this


kind
 of


cultural
 bias
 against
 quitting
 where
 we


uh
 in
 English
 we
 have
 like
 lots
 of


aphorisms
 like
 um
 quitters
 never
 win
 and


winner
 winners
 never
 quit
 you
 know
 if
 at


first
 you
 don't
 succeed
 try
 try
 again


which
 obviously
 is
 encouraging
 not


quitting
 so
 when
 we
 look
 at
 a
 lot
 of
 the


way
 that
 we
 we
 think
 about
 uh
 quitting


from
 a
 cultural
 standpoint
 we
 think
 that


quitters
 are
 are
 losers
 or
 weak
 willed


or
 lack
 character
 so
 that's
 kind
 of
 like


on
 the
 cultural
 side
 but
 then
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 cognitive
 biases
 that
 we
 know


about
 sort
 of
 individually
 things
 like


sun
 cost
 bias
 endowment
 effect
 which
 we


can
 go
 into
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 things
 like


that
 where
 when
 you
 actually
 look
 across


those
 biases
 they
 all
 result
 in
 a


failure
 to
 stop
 things
 so
 I
 I
 think
 it's


very
 multi-pronged
 which
 I
 think
 is
 part


of
 what
 makes
 it
 such
 a
 hard
 problem
 to


address
 well
 let's
 touch
 on
 some
 of


these
 um
 uh
 some
 of
 these
 things
 so
 Sun


costs
 what
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 why
 is
 it


so
 difficult
 to
 sell
 the
 the


losers
 yeah
 so
 when
 we're
 trying
 to
 make


a
 decision
 about
 whether
 to
 continue


something
 we
 take
 into
 account
 what


we've
 already
 spent
 in
 other
 words
 costs


that
 we've
 already
 sunk
 into
 the
 project


and
 that's
 doesn't
 isn't
 just
 money
 it


can
 be
 time
 and
 attention
 and
 effort
 so


what
 we'd
 ideally
 like
 to
 do
 as


humans
 is
 when
 we're
 approaching


something
 that
 we're
 trying
 to
 decide


whether
 we're
 going
 to


continue
 we
 would
 only
 continue
 that


thing
 if
 we
 were
 willing
 to
 start
 it


fresh
 today
 so
 so
 if
 we
 applied
 that
 to


for
 example
 a
 stock
 that
 we
 bought
 um


let's
 say
 that
 there's
 a
 stock
 trading


at


40
 and
 we've
 never
 owned
 it
 and
 we
 look


at
 it
 and
 we
 we
 do
 our
 analysis
 on
 it


and
 we
 decide
 that
 it's
 not
 a
 buy
 that


we
 ought
 not
 buy
 it
 at
 40
 uh
 we'd
 like


to
 then
 if
 we
 bought
 it
 at
 50
 and
 it's


now
 trading
 at
 40
 be
 able
 to
 sell
 it


because
 when
 it's
 trading
 at
 40


regardless
 of
 whether
 we
 owned
 it
 at
 50


what
 we're
 really
 saying
 is
 that
 I


wouldn't
 buy
 it
 today
 so
 if
 I
 wouldn't


buy
 it
 today
 I
 should
 sell
 it
 because


holding
 is
 the
 same
 as
 buying
 right
 so


the
 problem
 with
 the
 sun
 cost
 fallacy
 is


that
 we
 don't
 do


that
 and
 we
 have
 that
 feeling
 that
 I


think
 everybody
 can
 intu
 it
 of
 if
 I
 sell


it
 I
 won't
 be
 able
 to
 get
 my
 money


back
 um
 if
 I
 walk
 away
 now
 I'll
 have


wasted
 everything
 that
 I
 put
 into
 it
 so


as
 an
 example
 if
 you're
 in
 a
 job
 that


there's
 no
 way
 that
 you
 would
 take
 today


you
 won't
 walk
 away
 because
 you're


afraid
 you'll
 have
 wasted
 everything


that
 you
 put
 into
 it
 uh
 all
 the
 training


all
 the
 time
 and
 that
 kind
 of
 thing
 but


again
 if
 you
 wouldn't
 take
 it
 today
 you


ought
 not
 to
 continue
 forward
 and
 and


really
 what
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 is
 that
 we


have
 this
 we
 have
 this
 irrationality


where
 we
 think
 of
 waste
 as
 a


retrospective
 problem
 what
 I
 will
 have


wasted
 as
 opposed
 to
 a
 prospective


problem
 which
 is
 is
 the
 next
 dollar
 the


next
 unit
 of
 effort
 or
 attention
 that
 I


put
 into
 into
 this
 thing
 going
 forward


going
 to
 be
 uh
 positive
 expected
 value


am
 I
 going
 to
 actually
 win
 to
 it
 and
 we


have
 to
 start
 getting
 our
 eyes
 forward


on
 these
 things
 you
 also
 talk
 about
 the


same
 uh
 issue
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 montering


and
 for
 instance
 climbing
 Mont
 Everest


you
 know
 when
 do
 you
 when
 do
 you
 quit


when
 do
 you
 call
 it
 a
 day
 when
 do
 you


give
 up
 yeah
 so
 so
 these
 are
 all


expected
 value
 problems
 right
 so


expected
 value
 is
 just
 simply
 uh
 what
 is


your
 the
 sort
 of
 weighted
 average
 of
 the


prob
 abilities
 and
 payoffs
 you
 know


across
 a
 set
 of
 outcomes
 that
 are


available
 to
 you
 and
 when
 we're


investing
 we're
 we're
 trying
 to
 make


positive
 expected
 value
 Investments


meaning
 as
 I
 think
 about
 the
 outcomes


that
 are
 available
 for
 whatever


instrument
 it
 is
 that
 I'm
 investing
 in
 I


think
 that
 in
 the
 long
 run
 on
 average


I'm
 going
 to
 make
 money
 and
 then
 we
 can


take
 it
 a
 step
 further
 and
 say
 uh
 this


is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 better
 expected
 value


in
 comparison
 to
 other
 options
 that
 I


have
 available
 to
 me
 so
 an
 option
 could


be
 negative
 expy
 on
 its
 own
 meaning
 if
 I


buy
 this
 stock
 I'm
 actually
 losing
 to


that
 decision
 or
 it
 could
 be
 I
 can
 buy


this
 stock
 and
 I'm
 winning
 to
 the


decision
 but
 not
 as
 much
 as
 I
 would
 win


if
 I
 put
 my
 money
 in
 a
 different
 stock


okay
 so
 that's
 how
 we
 want
 to
 think


about
 expected
 value
 so
 expected
 value


only
 makes
 sense
 uh
 in
 if
 you
 related
 to


Nikolai
 what
 you


value
 or
 what
 your
 goals
 are
 right
 so


something
 that
 might
 be
 positive


expected
 value
 for
 me
 might
 be
 negative


expected
 value
 for
 you
 and
 vice
 versa
 so


we
 can
 think
 about
 for
 me
 I
 wouldn't


want
 to
 start
 climbing
 Mount
 Everest


because
 like
 the
 discomfort
 and
 I'd
 be


very
 cold
 and
 it
 wouldn't
 really
 be
 my


thing
 but
 for
 you
 you
 may
 be
 somebody


who
 really
 wants
 to
 stand
 on
 the
 top
 of


the
 world
 and
 do
 something
 that
 is
 uh


different
 than
 you
 know
 almost
 any
 human


being
 has
 been
 able
 to
 accomplish
 I'll


tell
 you
 one
 thing
 I'll
 tell
 you
 one


thing
 Annie
 I
 can
 guarantee
 you
 I
 will


never
 stand
 at
 the
 top
 on
 deest
 well


fair
 enough
 but
 let's
 pretend
 so
 I'll
 be


the
 person
 who
 would
 be
 willing
 to
 do


that
 so
 for
 you
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 positive


expectancy
 to
 start
 but
 for
 me
 maybe


that's
 something
 where
 I'm
 willing
 to


tolerate
 certain
 risk
 yeah
 in
 this
 case


death
 and


injury
 in
 order
 to
 be
 able
 to
 say
 I
 have


stood
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 world
 and
 done


something
 that
 most
 people
 are
 never


going
 to
 do
 in
 their
 whole
 lives
 but


even
 so
 in
 there
 is
 some
 tolerance
 for


the
 probability
 of
 death
 so
 when
 you


should
 stop
 climbing
 when
 you
 should
 say


no
 I'm
 going
 to
 turn
 around


is
 the
 moment
 when
 the
 probability
 of


death
 and
 severe
 injury
 is
 higher
 than


your
 intention
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 climb
 in
 your
 book
 you


differentiate
 between
 quitting
 and


failure
 yeah
 so
 failure
 for
 me
 doesn't


mean
 uh
 just
 stopping
 something
 that
 you


started
 and
 and
 you
 know
 not
 achieving


your
 goal
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 that's


really
 what
 failure
 is
 I
 I
 think
 that


failure


is
 one
 of
 two
 things
 it's
 stopping
 some


something
 that
 is
 still
 worth
 it
 just


because
 it's
 hard
 so
 I
 would
 consider


that
 failure
 right
 like
 if
 it's
 still


worth
 it
 you
 shouldn't
 stop
 but
 failure


is
 also
 failing
 to
 stop
 something
 that


is
 no
 longer
 worthwhile
 so
 you
 know
 I


think
 for
 example
 if
 you
 continue
 to


climb
 Everest
 when
 you're
 in
 the
 middle


of
 a
 blizzard
 I
 would
 consider
 that
 a


failure
 so
 some
 people
 don't
 want
 to


turn
 around
 there
 because
 they're
 going


to
 process
 that
 as
 a
 failure
 to
 have


reached
 the
 Summit
 but
 I
 think
 that
 once


you
 start
 climbing
 under
 conditions
 when


you're
 clearly
 negative
 expectancy
 then


that's
 failure
 if
 we
 take
 a
 very
 simple


example
 like
 the
 stock
 right
 so
 we
 buy
 a


stock
 at
 50
 we
 sell
 it
 at
 40
 we
 feel


like
 a
 failure
 because
 we
 lost


$10
 but
 what's
 the
 real
 failure
 is
 would


be
 to
 continue
 to
 hold
 it
 when
 you
 could


put
 those
 resources
 that
 $40
 into


something
 that
 is
 actually
 going
 to
 win


that's
 actual
 failure
 you
 talk
 about
 the


kill
 criteria
 now
 how
 can
 one
 plan
 for


quitting
 yeah


so
 here's
 the
 interesting
 thing
 about


quitting
 is
 that
 uh
 we
 think
 that
 if
 we


buy
 a
 stock
 based
 on
 a
 particular
 thesis


or
 we
 invest
 based
 on
 a
 particular


thesis
 that
 when
 the
 the
 signals
 that
 we


ought
 to
 be
 seeing
 in
 the
 future
 that


that
 thesis
 implies
 don't
 materialize


that
 obviously
 we're
 going
 to
 sell
 and


we're
 going
 to
 take
 risk
 off
 but
 we
 know


that
 that's
 not
 true
 that
 that's
 a


really
 Bonkers
 intuition
 and
 in
 fact


when
 we
 see
 those
 signals
 well
 often


escalate
 our
 commitment
 to
 the
 cause
 uh


that's
 where
 we
 get
 that
 sort
 of
 old
 saw


of
 like
 well
 now
 it's
 really
 cheap
 right


and
 you
 actually
 want
 to
 buy
 more
 right


even
 though
 you
 wouldn't
 start
 it
 today


so
 how
 do
 we
 actually
 overcome
 that


problem
 you
 know
 because
 obviously
 if


we're
 not
 if
 we're
 rationalizing
 away
 or


ignoring
 the
 signals
 that
 tell
 us
 we


should
 stop
 how
 do
 we
 solve
 the
 problem


and
 it
 turns
 out
 there's
 a
 relatively


simple
 trick
 that
 actually
 really


drastically
 increases
 the
 chance
 that


you'll
 stop
 when
 the
 time
 is
 right
 and


that
 is
 to
 think
 about
 what
 those


signals
 that
 you
 might
 encounter
 are
 in


the
 future
 and
 then
 commit
 before
 you


start
 to
 actions
 if
 you
 see
 those


signals
 so
 I'll
 give
 you
 a
 very
 simple


example
 let's
 just
 imagine
 that
 it's


2021
 and
 you
 have
 bought


Bitcoin
 and
 your
 stated
 reason
 your


thesis
 for
 buying
 Bitcoin
 is
 that
 you


believe
 it
 will
 be
 a
 good
 hedge
 against


Market
 the
 market
 going
 down
 okay
 so


that's
 why
 you
 are
 buying
 it
 if
 the


market
 goes
 down
 you
 believe
 that
 that


bit
 Bitcoin
 will
 be
 uncorrelated
 with


that
 and
 so
 it
 will
 act
 as
 a
 good
 hedge


against
 sort
 of
 Market
 chaos
 so
 now
 I'm


going
 to
 say
 to
 you
 Nikolai
 all
 right
 so


let's
 say
 that
 you
 buy
 it
 how
 much
 of
 a


correlation
 would
 you
 have
 to
 see
 over


what
 time
 period
 between
 the
 market


going
 down
 and
 Bitcoin
 going
 down
 as


well
 right
 so
 we
 can
 now
 write
 that
 down


right
 so
 if
 you
 see
 a
 strong
 enough


correlation
 and
 you
 determine
 what
 that


is
 right
 over
 a
 certain
 amount
 of
 time


so
 it's
 durable
 that
 you'll
 actually


start
 to
 take
 risk
 off
 and
 sell
 Bitcoin


right
 so
 if
 we
 do
 that
 in
 advance
 you're


much
 more
 likely
 to
 take
 risk
 off
 than


if
 you
 just
 say
 well
 my
 thesis
 implies


that
 so
 obviously
 I'm
 going
 to
 pay


attention
 when
 bitcoin's
 going
 down


along
 with
 the
 market
 and
 what
 that


helps
 you
 to
 avoid
 is
 rationalization
 no


I
 still
 believe
 it
 and
 now
 bitcoin's


cheaper
 so
 I'll
 buy
 more
 or
 the
 other


thing
 that
 will
 happen
 in
 order
 to
 avoid


selling
 is
 thesis
 Creed
 well
 yeah
 okay


it
 is
 correlated
 but
 actually
 I
 own


Bitcoin
 as
 a


philosophical
 uh
 move
 right
 or
 something


like
 that
 so
 um
 there's
 a
 very
 simple


example
 of
 a
 kill
 criteria
 that
 actually


Mountaineers
 use
 uh
 so
 if
 you
 take


Everest
 on
 Summit


day
 they
 leave
 Camp
 4
 at
 about
 midnight


uh
 and
 the
 reason
 is
 that
 they
 want
 to


get
 to
 this
 part
 of
 the
 mountain
 called


the
 southeast
 Ridge
 which
 is
 really


dangerous
 you
 have
 to
 go
 up
 single
 Le


file
 they
 want
 to
 get
 there
 in
 daylight


on
 the
 way
 up
 the
 mountain
 but
 they
 also


want
 to
 get
 there
 in
 time
 that
 they
 can


come
 back
 down
 and
 and
 Traverse
 it
 again


in
 daylight
 all
 right
 so
 this
 is
 kind
 of


a
 ballet
 right
 like
 they've
 got
 to
 sort


of
 deal
 with
 this
 dance
 so
 they
 leave
 at


midnight
 but
 what
 that
 also
 means
 is
 in


order
 to
 get
 back
 down
 the
 southeast


Ridge
 you
 must
 have
 reached
 the
 summit


by
 1M
 and
 if
 you
 reach
 the
 summit
 past
 1


p.m.
 the
 probability
 that
 you're
 coming


down
 that
 Southeast
 Ridge
 and
 darkness


is
 too
 high
 and
 the
 southeast
 Ridge


again
 is
 is
 very
 very
 dangerous
 you


don't
 want
 to
 Traverse
 it
 in
 darkness
 so


they
 actually


set
 on
 that
 day
 a
 turnaround
 time
 of
 1


p.m.
 no
 matter
 where
 you
 are
 on
 the


mountain
 you
 have
 to
 turn
 around
 at
 1


p.m.
 so
 this
 is
 a
 very
 good
 simple


example
 of
 a
 kill
 criteria
 that
 gets


people
 to
 turn
 around
 when
 they


otherwise
 might
 not
 now
 quitting
 is
 is


one
 aspect
 of
 decision-
 making
 but
 um


what
 are
 the
 other
 biases
 you
 accounted


the
 most
 in
 decision-making


generally
 so
 I
 think
 probably
 the


biggest
 bias
 that
 I
 see
 and
 actually
 we


just
 had
 in
 America
 um
 the
 playoffs
 with


uh
 the
 Detroit
 Lions
 who
 made
 some


decisions
 in
 the
 fourth
 quarter
 that


people
 are
 really
 criticizing
 um
 and


this
 leads
 me
 to
 probably
 the
 biggest


bias
 that
 I
 see
 which
 is
 um
 resulting
 so


resulting
 is
 otherwise
 known
 as
 outcome


bias
 and
 it's
 a
 bias
 where
 you
 judge
 the


quality
 of
 the
 decision
 by
 a
 quality
 the


quality
 of
 the
 outcome
 so
 the
 Lions
 had


a
 couple
 times
 where
 they
 went
 went
 for


it
 on
 fourth
 down
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 I


actually
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 analytics


are
 whether
 that
 was
 correct
 for
 them
 to


do
 on
 those
 tries
 uh
 but
 if
 it
 was


mathematically
 correct
 it
 was


mathematically
 correct
 it
 doesn't
 really


matter
 um
 but
 none
 of
 it
 worked
 out
 so


uh
 I
 think
 Nate
 silver
 posted
 that
 it


was
 going
 to
 set
 fourth
 down
 decisions


back
 you
 know
 a
 decade
 just
 because
 it


didn't
 work
 out
 so
 um
 you
 know
 one
 of


the
 famous
 examples
 of
 that
 actually


also
 comes
 from
 American
 football
 in
 the


2015
 Super
 Bowl
 uh
 the
 Seattle
 Seahawks


were
 on
 the
 one
 yard
 line
 of
 the
 New


England
 Patriots
 so
 they
 have
 to
 move


the
 ball
 one
 yard
 they're
 four
 points


down
 meaning
 they
 have
 to
 score
 a


touchdown
 in
 order
 to
 go
 ahead
 and


there's
 only
 26
 seconds
 left
 in
 the


whole
 game
 uh
 and
 Pete
 Carroll
 decides


to
 throw
 a
 pass
 play
 um
 in
 this


situation
 and
 uh
 the
 expected
 the


expected
 play
 is
 for
 them
 to
 run
 the


ball
 hand
 it
 off
 to
 the
 running
 back
 try


to
 get
 off
 the
 across
 the
 goal
 line
 but


he
 he
 chooses
 the
 pass
 play
 the
 pass
 is


intercepted
 and
 people
 to
 this
 day
 think


it
 was
 one
 of
 the
 worst
 calls
 in
 Super


Bowl
 history
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 going
 to


go
 into
 the
 details
 of
 the
 math
 but
 it's


not
 even
 close
 the
 choice
 that
 he
 made


is
 the
 much
 better
 choice
 like
 by
 a
 lot


so
 how
 should
 so
 how
 should
 we
 evaluate


a
 decision
 like
 that
 well
 we
 should


evaluate
 by
 are
 you
 is
 it
 the
 best


expected
 value


decision
 so
 in
 this
 particular
 case
 we


can
 work
 the
 math
 out
 right
 like
 what's


the
 probability
 of
 a
 touchdown
 what's


the
 probability
 of
 an
 interception


what's
 the
 probability
 of
 an
 incomplete


pass
 what's
 the
 probability
 of
 the
 Run


scoring
 so
 on
 so
 forth
 because
 we
 have


base
 rates
 for
 all
 that
 stuff
 and
 we
 can


figure
 out
 like
 which
 on
 average
 is


going
 to
 get
 you
 the
 best
 results
 but


what
 happens
 is
 that
 the
 outcome
 so


overshadows
 the
 result
 of
 the
 decision


so
 overshadows
 our
 ability
 to
 think
 that


through
 that
 um
 none
 of
 that
 really


matters
 when
 we're
 evaluating
 the


decision
 and
 we
 can
 see
 that
 with
 the


peak
 heral
 decision
 it's
 intercepted
 he


loses
 the
 game
 everybody
 says
 it's
 the


worst
 you
 know
 decision
 in
 super
 Bowl


history
 but
 we
 can
 do
 the
 thought


experiment
 really
 easily
 well
 what
 if
 it


had
 been
 caught
 for
 the
 game-winning


touchdown
 obviously
 everybody
 would
 have


said
 it
 was
 an
 amazing
 decision
 of


course
 and
 as
 you
 know
 in
 investing
 it's


like
 if
 you
 invest
 in
 one
 stock
 and


loses
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 it
 was
 a
 bad


decision
 if
 you
 invest
 in
 a
 well


Diversified
 portfolio
 over
 some
 durable


period
 of
 time
 where
 you
 continually
 are


performing
 below
 beta
 now
 I
 can
 say


something
 about
 your
 decision-making


right
 but
 but
 I
 have
 to
 have
 enough
 data


points
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that
 and
 what
 we


do
 instead
 is
 we
 take
 one
 data
 point
 we


look
 at
 the
 outcome
 and
 say
 that
 was
 a


mistake
 what
 is
 your
 perspective
 on


intuition
 and
 Analysis
 and


decision-making
 intuition
 can
 be
 very


accurate
 your
 gut
 can
 be
 very
 accurate


the
 problem
 is
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 know
 if


it's
 very
 accurate
 and
 it's
 very
 hard
 to


spot
 errors
 in
 your
 intuition
 if
 we


don't
 make
 what
 your
 intuition
 is


intuiting
 um
 explicit
 so
 basically
 what


I
 try
 to
 get
 people
 to
 do
 and
 when
 I'm


working
 with
 clients
 is
 I
 take
 I
 say


look
 you
 have
 some
 model
 that
 you're


using
 for
 making
 these


decisions
 I
 would
 like
 to
 take
 that


model
 and
 make
 it
 explicit
 and
 then
 make


sure
 that
 you're
 you're
 judging
 uh
 your


decisions
 based
 on
 that
 model
 this
 is


for
 big
 decisions
 so
 let
 me
 give
 you
 an


example
 one
 of
 the
 favorite
 things
 that


Venture
 investors
 early
 stage
 Venture


investors
 like
 to
 say
 and
 I'm
 sure


you've
 heard
 this
 is
 when
 you
 you
 ask


them
 how
 they
 make
 their
 decisions
 they


say
 I
 know
 a
 good
 founder
 when
 I
 see
 one


so
 what
 I
 would
 say
 to
 somebody
 in
 that


situation
 is
 I
 I
 can't
 disagree
 with
 you


you
 may
 very
 well
 know
 a
 good
 founder


when
 you
 see
 one
 I
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 data


to
 be
 able
 to
 disagree
 with
 you
 but
 what


do
 you
 mean
 by
 good


founder
 so
 now
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 them
 to


be
 explicit
 by
 what
 they
 mean
 by
 good


founder
 what
 is
 your
 model
 of
 a
 good


founder
 right
 is
 it
 someone
 who's
 gone


really
 deep
 on
 the
 problem
 is
 it
 someone


who
 is
 single-minded
 is
 it
 someone
 who


whatever
 it
 is
 right
 so
 we're
 going
 to


write
 down
 what
 are
 the
 qualities
 of


somebody
 a
 Founder
 that
 makes
 you
 put


them
 in
 the
 category
 of
 good
 founder
 and


then
 I
 might
 go
 beyond
 that
 and
 say
 when


you
 think
 about
 the
 investment
 broadly


what
 are
 the
 things
 that
 you're
 thinking


about
 right
 so
 they
 might
 tell
 me
 well
 I


want
 that
 it
 to
 be
 in
 a
 good
 Market
 with


no
 headwinds
 and
 growing


Tam
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 want
 the
 product
 to
 be


something
 that
 is
 going
 to
 solve
 a


problem
 for
 people
 whatever
 so
 we're
 now


going
 to
 create
 a
 decision
 rubric
 which


ha
 basically
 is
 an
 explicit


representation
 of
 what
 your
 model
 of
 a


good
 investment
 is
 so
 all
 I'm
 doing
 is


taking
 your
 belief
 I'm
 not
 disagreeing


with
 what
 you
 think
 I'm
 taking
 what
 you


how
 you
 model
 these
 problems
 and
 I'm


making
 explicit
 now
 what
 that's
 going
 to


do
 is
 as
 you
 make
 decisions
 about


Investments
 it's
 going
 to
 reduce
 the


noise
 in
 your
 Investments
 it's
 also


going
 to
 reduce
 the
 bias
 because
 it's


going
 to
 be
 hard
 for
 you
 to


downplay
 bad
 signals
 or
 overplay
 good


signals
 and
 then
 the
 other
 thing
 it's


going
 to
 do
 is
 it's
 going
 to
 help
 you
 to


uplevel
 your
 team
 very
 quickly
 because


let's
 say
 Nikolai
 that
 you
 are
 actually


amazing
 now
 we've
 created
 the
 model
 of


how
 you
 view
 Investments
 it's
 now


explicit
 we
 can
 share
 that
 out
 with
 the


other
 people
 on
 your
 team
 who
 now
 are


going
 to
 learn
 a
 lot
 faster
 how
 to
 make


great
 Investments
 not
 only
 that
 we


become
 a
 data
 collection
 machine
 because


every
 investment
 we're
 actually
 now


writing
 down
 explicitly
 what
 is


nikolai's
 point
 of
 view
 on
 this


investment
 so
 now
 when
 we
 get
 a
 good
 or


bad
 result
 we
 can
 now
 go
 back
 and
 not


fall
 into
 the
 resulting
 problem
 because


we
 can
 go
 back
 and
 look
 at
 what
 you
 were


thinking
 at
 the
 time
 what
 are
 the
 other


keys
 to
 making
 um
 group
 decisions
 better


the
 most
 important
 part
 is
 when
 you
 are


collecting
 people's


judgments
 you
 should
 do
 so
 in
 what
 we


would
 call
 a
 nominal
 group
 so
 a
 nominal


group
 is
 a
 group
 of
 people
 who
 are


working
 together
 but
 for
 the
 time
 that


they're
 in
 a
 nominal
 group
 they're


working
 independ
 ently
 L
 of
 each
 other


so
 in
 other
 words
 let's
 imagine
 that
 I


create
 this
 investment
 rubric
 okay
 so


I've
 got
 this
 investment
 rubric
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 have
 you
 raid
 on
 a
 scale
 of
 1


to
 S
 how
 strong
 the
 market
 is
 I'm


simplifying
 how
 strong
 the
 product
 is


how
 strong
 the
 founder
 is
 I'm
 going
 to


have
 you
 some
 make
 some
 forecasts
 of


whatever
 like
 you
 could
 make
 a
 forecast


of
 uh
 how
 many
 widgets
 do
 you
 believe


this
 company
 is
 going
 to
 produce
 in
 the


next
 six
 months
 whatever
 so
 it's


whatever
 you
 care
 about
 in
 an
 investment


so
 you're
 going
 to
 fill
 that
 out
 I
 don't


want
 to
 get
 your
 opinion
 in
 front
 of


other
 people
 so
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 you


that
 rubric
 independently
 of
 the
 next


person
 and
 the
 next
 person
 and
 the
 next


person
 and
 this
 is
 probably
 the
 single


biggest
 thing
 you
 can
 do
 in
 order
 to


improve
 decision-making
 because
 when
 you


talk
 in


groups
 it
 makes
 your
 decisions
 in


general
 worse
 th
 and
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 that


is
 not
 that
 you
 discuss
 other
 people's


opinions
 in
 groups
 it's
 that
 you
 do
 the


the
 the
 opinion
 Discovery
 yeah
 in
 groups


because
 remember
 decisions
 have
 two


parts
 right
 there
 are
 facts


but
 then
 there
 are
 also
 your
 subjective


judgments
 right
 like
 how
 are
 you


modeling
 those
 facts
 so
 you
 could
 look


at
 facts
 about
 a
 particular


market
 and
 I
 could
 look
 about
 at
 facts


about
 a
 particular
 market
 and
 we
 could


have
 very
 different
 judgments
 of
 that


market
 even
 so
 so
 where
 where
 we're


going
 to
 be
 really
 helped
 as
 a
 team
 is


to
 understand
 that
 you're
 really
 bullish


on
 that
 market
 I'm
 really
 bearish
 on


that
 market
 even
 though
 we're
 looking
 at


the
 same
 set
 of
 facts
 and
 for
 me
 to


truly
 understand
 what
 your
 rationale
 is


for
 why
 you're
 bull
 for
 you
 to
 truly


understand
 what
 my
 rationale
 is
 for
 why


I'm
 bearish
 for
 us
 not
 to
 try
 to


convince
 each
 other
 of
 the
 other


person's
 point
 of
 view
 but
 to
 in
 with


curiosity
 understand
 why
 the
 person
 is


modeling
 the
 decision
 that
 way
 because


all
 of
 the
 increase
 in
 accuracy
 is
 going


to
 happen
 in
 those
 gaps
 now
 in
 order
 to


do
 that
 though
 I
 have
 to
 know
 the
 Gap


exists
 and
 the
 problem
 is
 if
 we're
 sort


of
 eliciting
 those
 opinions
 in
 a
 group


setting
 you're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 how


strongly
 you
 feel
 that
 this
 is
 a
 great


market
 and
 me
 over
 here
 here
 who
 came


into
 the
 room
 being
 bearish
 I
 am
 going


to
 be
 much
 less
 likely
 to
 express
 that


opinion
 do
 you
 speak
 to
 a
 little
 people


before
 you
 make
 an
 important


decision
 it
 dep
 so
 if
 it's
 a
 really


important
 decision
 yes
 who
 do
 you
 speak


to
 so
 um
 well
 I
 speak
 to
 people
 who
 I


think
 are
 going
 to
 give
 me
 a
 good
 point


of
 view
 so
 I
 defin
 I
 speak
 to
 my
 husband


I
 speak
 to
 and
 then
 I
 think
 about
 who


are
 who
 are
 people
 that
 I
 know


who
 have
 the
 right
 knowledge
 set
 to
 be


able
 to
 actually
 give
 me
 good
 advice


here
 and
 then
 here's
 the
 key
 because


remember
 this
 idea
 of
 I
 don't
 want
 to


contaminate
 anybody
 right
 I
 want
 to
 know


what
 their
 true
 point
 of
 view
 is
 when
 I


elicit
 their
 advice
 I
 don't
 tell
 them


what
 I
 think
 so
 this
 is
 something
 that
 I


learned
 in
 poker
 so
 obviously
 if
 I'm


coming
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 a
 hand
 of
 Poker


that
 I
 played
 I'm
 asking
 you
 about


something
 that
 has
 already


occurred
 so
 I
 know
 what
 my
 opinion
 was


cuz
 I
 executed
 it
 my
 opinion
 was
 I


should
 raise
 or
 fold
 or
 call
 or
 whatever


and
 I
 know
 how
 the
 hand
 turned
 out
 right


so
 I
 know
 both
 of
 those
 things
 so
 if
 I


come
 and
 I
 tell
 you
 the
 whole
 hand
 and


then
 ask
 to
 rewind
 to
 ask
 you
 advice
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 get
 good
 advice
 for
 a


couple
 reasons
 one
 is
 the
 resulting


problem
 if
 you
 know
 I
 lost
 the
 hand


you're
 going
 to
 tend
 to
 interpret
 my


decisions
 negatively
 if
 you
 know
 I
 won


the
 hand
 you're
 going
 to
 tend
 to


interpret
 them
 positively
 and
 the
 other


thing
 is
 if
 you
 already
 know
 what
 I


thought
 I
 should
 do
 that's
 going
 to
 now


infect
 your
 opinion
 so
 the
 way
 that
 I


would
 describe
 a
 hand
 to
 you
 is
 hey


Nicol
 I
 have
 a
 question
 about
 a
 hand
 I


played
 you
 know
 this
 person
 was
 in
 front


of
 me
 they
 were
 in
 first
 position
 they


raised
 I
 would
 tell
 you
 things
 about
 the


way
 that
 person
 played
 that
 you
 needed


like
 were
 they
 aggressive
 were
 they
 not


aggressive
 uh
 were
 they
 tight
 were
 they


loose
 you
 know
 these
 these
 kinds
 of


things
 right
 I
 would
 tell
 you
 how
 many


chips
 they
 had
 and
 then
 I
 would
 say
 so


now
 I'm
 in
 second
 position
 I
 look
 down


and
 I
 have
 Ace
 Queen
 and
 then
 that's
 it


I
 say
 what
 would
 you
 do
 what
 are
 some
 of


the
 other
 lessons
 you
 learned
 from
 poker


so
 that
 was
 a
 big
 lesson
 but
 what's


interesting
 in
 poker
 is
 that
 luck
 is


your
 worst
 enemy


so
 let's
 say
 that
 we're
 playing


chess
 and
 I
 lose
 at
 chess
 to
 you
 this
 is


a
 game
 that
 has
 very
 little
 luck
 I
 can't


do
 anything
 but
 sort
 of
 say
 I've
 got
 to


look
 back
 and
 examine
 my
 decisions


because
 what's
 the
 explanation
 for
 why
 I


lost
 right
 and
 if
 I
 won
 I
 should
 rightly


be
 able
 to
 say
 I
 should
 look
 back


because
 I
 think
 I
 probably
 made


decisions
 well
 but
 once
 we
 add


volatility
 and
 it
 becomes
 really
 hard
 to


close
 a
 good
 feedback
 loop
 because
 what


I
 would
 see
 from
 players
 all
 the
 time


and
 I
 certainly
 had
 this
 urge
 myself
 is


that
 when
 they
 lost
 it
 was
 always
 Luck's


fault
 and
 they
 W
 when
 they
 won
 it
 was


always
 due
 to
 their
 skill
 of
 course
 so


one
 of
 the
 reasons
 why
 when
 I
 was


talking
 to
 other
 people
 to
 get
 their


advice
 I
 never
 told
 them
 how
 it
 turned


out
 was
 because
 I
 wanted
 to
 make
 sure
 I


was
 getting
 their
 true
 opinion
 because
 I


wanted
 to
 know
 win
 or
 lose
 did
 I
 play


the
 handbell
 that's
 what
 I
 was
 really


obsessed
 with
 but
 it's
 really
 hard


because
 it
 comes
 to
 this
 thing
 and
 this


is
 I
 think
 the
 big
 lesson
 that
 I
 learned


from
 poker
 and
 I
 think
 that
 Daniel
 Conan


you
 know
 Nobel
 laer
 I
 think
 this
 is
 I


think
 he
 also
 thinks
 this
 is
 like
 the


biggest
 urge
 for
 humans
 that
 really


creates
 a
 lot
 of
 decision
 error
 is
 that


we
 always
 want
 to
 have
 a
 positive


self-narrative
 of
 our
 life
 and
 there's
 a


catch
 22
 in
 there
 which
 is
 making
 great


decisions
 over
 time
 and
 accepting
 your


mistakes
 over
 time
 will
 in
 the
 end


create
 the
 most
 positive
 self
 Nar


narrative
 but
 human
 beings
 aren't
 that


way
 human
 beings
 want
 to
 feel
 good
 about


themselves


now
 not
 some
 future
 version
 of
 you
 who


you've
 never
 even
 met
 now
 so
 what


happens
 when
 you
 lose
 a
 hand
 of
 Poker


you
 feel
 bad
 right
 oh
 but
 you
 feel
 bad


maybe
 I
 made
 mistakes
 maybe
 I'm
 a
 bad


player
 um
 you're
 not
 advancing
 that


positive


self-image
 right
 in
 that
 moment
 and
 so


what
 do
 we
 do
 we
 say
 oh
 I
 got
 bad
 luck


so
 what
 should
 we
 should
 we
 do
 what
 we


should
 do
 is
 say


obsessively
 let
 me
 examine
 the
 decisions


that
 I
 made
 and
 Tred
 to
 feel
 figure
 out


win
 or
 lose
 whether
 I
 maximized
 my


expected
 value
 did
 I
 make
 the
 best


choice
 every
 single
 time
 now
 that's
 hard


to
 do
 right
 I
 mean
 that's
 the
 thing


that's
 hard
 to
 do
 but
 we
 can
 think
 about


like
 a
 2
 by
 two
 Matrix
 right
 where


you've
 got
 on
 one
 side
 the
 decision


quality
 good
 decision
 bad
 decision
 and


then
 you've
 got
 the
 outcome
 quality
 good


outcome
 bad
 outcome
 right
 right
 and
 if


you've
 got
 good
 good
 that
 would
 be
 an


earned
 reward
 if
 you've
 got
 good
 bad


that
 would
 be
 bad
 luck
 if
 you've
 got
 bad


good
 that
 would
 be
 dumb
 luck
 and
 if


you've
 got
 bad
 bad
 that
 would
 be
 what


you
 deserve
 right
 all
 right
 so
 we
 can


think
 about
 when
 we're
 thinking
 for


ourselves
 the
 way
 that
 we
 interpret
 the


world
 when
 when
 luck
 is
 an
 available


explanation
 is
 everything
 that
 we're


doing
 is
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 this
 idea


that
 we
 made
 a
 great
 good
 decision
 so


that
 means
 that
 we
 interpret
 the
 World


either
 is
 earned


reward
 or
 is
 bad
 luck
 this
 is
 something


called
 self-serving
 bias
 and
 boy
 if
 you


ever
 want
 to
 see
 that
 in


play
 just
 go
 into
 a
 casino
 because


that's
 all
 you're
 going
 to
 hear
 I


believe
 that
 Bill
 Gates
 came
 to
 the


casino
 to
 watch
 you


play
 oh
 that's
 true
 wait
 how
 did
 you


know
 that
 that's
 so
 funny
 so
 uh
 Bill


Gates
 kind
 of
 famously
 um
 used
 to
 play


very
 very
 low
 stakes
 poker
 and
 when
 I


mean
 low
 stakes
 poker
 I
 mean
 like
 $3
 $6


poker
 so
 just
 to
 give
 you
 an
 idea
 if
 I


sat
 down
 in
 a
 $3
 $6
 game
 I
 might
 risk


$200
 so
 Bill
 Gates
 would
 come
 in
 and
 so


this
 was
 way
 back
 in
 the
 day
 um
 like
 the


Bellagio
 Casino
 wasn't
 even
 open
 yet
 it


was
 at
 it
 was
 at
 the
 Mirage
 and
 I
 was


playing
 I
 remember
 I
 was
 playing
 in
 a


game
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 low
 stakes
 for
 me


I
 think
 I
 was
 playing
 like
 an
 8160


game
 um
 and
 that's
 just
 the
 betting


limits
 is
 the
 maximum
 bet
 is


$60
 well
 this
 person
 Taps
 me
 on
 the


shoulder
 and
 says
 do
 you
 mind
 if
 I
 sit


down
 behind
 you
 and
 watch
 you


play
 and
 I'm
 about
 to
 turn
 around
 and


say
 no
 like
 you're
 a
 stranger
 why
 would


I
 let
 you
 watch
 my
 play
 and
 I
 look
 up


and
 I
 see
 it's
 Bill
 Gates
 so
 I
 was
 like


sure
 sit
 down
 and
 watch
 me
 play
 so
 it's


interesting
 he
 sat
 down
 behind
 me
 and


watched
 me
 play
 and
 he
 mostly
 asked
 me


about
 bluffing
 tell
 me
 about


bluffing
 yeah
 so
 if
 I'm
 playing
 a
 game


where
 I
 can
 play
 perfectly


straightforwardly
 then
 I
 wouldn't
 really


need
 need
 to
 Bluff
 ever
 right
 because
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 need
 to
 I
 wouldn't
 I


wouldn't
 really
 need
 to
 take
 that
 risk


on
 and
 I
 would
 only
 Bluff
 in
 situations


where
 I
 I
 knew
 for
 a
 fact
 that
 I
 was


well
 into
 positive
 expectancy
 in
 other


words
 the
 bluff
 itself
 was
 really


earning
 for
 me
 in
 that
 moment
 compared


to
 other
 options
 that
 I
 could
 use
 that


capital
 for
 right
 so
 imagine
 that
 I'm
 in


a
 game
 where
 I
 know
 that
 on
 average
 I


just
 have
 a
 5%
 Edge
 and
 I
 can
 run
 this


Bluff
 that
 is
 maybe
 and
 remember
 this


I'm
 I'm
 guessing
 at
 the
 expectancy


because
 I
 can't
 see
 the
 other
 players


cards
 but
 if
 I'm
 in
 a
 situation
 where


playing


straightforward
 uh
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


problem
 because
 people
 are
 going
 to


start
 to
 be
 able
 to
 read
 me
 and
 then


they're
 not
 going
 to
 pay
 off
 my
 good


hands
 and
 that's
 going
 to
 reduce
 my
 earn


now
 I
 want
 to
 bring
 BFF
 bluffing
 into


the
 equation
 and
 the
 bluff
 itself
 can
 be


50/50
 or
 slightly
 less
 than
 50/50
 I
 can


actually
 be
 slightly
 negative
 expectancy


on
 the
 bluff
 itself
 because
 it
 will
 earn


me
 money
 later
 so
 in
 other
 words
 Nikolai


if
 I'm
 playing
 with
 you
 and
 you
 see
 that


every
 time
 that
 I
 bet
 big
 I
 have
 a
 good


hand
 at
 some
 point
 you're
 only
 going
 to


call
 me
 when
 you
 know
 you
 have
 a
 better


one
 so
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 bad
 so
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 get
 paid
 because
 you're
 only


going
 to
 call
 me
 when
 I'm
 beat
 so
 that's


bad
 but
 if
 you
 see
 that
 sometimes
 when
 I


Bluff
 I
 have
 an
 eight
 and
 a
 three
 and


nothing
 particularly
 good
 happening
 and


you
 see
 that
 from
 me
 now
 when
 I
 do
 have


a
 really
 good
 hand
 you're
 going
 to
 not


know
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 start


pay
 what's
 called
 paying
 me
 off
 you're


going
 to
 have
 to
 start
 calling
 me
 with


weaker
 hands
 so
 that's
 why
 that
 bluff
 is


really
 important
 now
 I
 have
 played
 in


games
 with
 players
 who
 are
 what
 we
 call


very
 tight
 meaning
 that
 they'll
 only


ever
 bet
 when
 they
 know
 they
 have
 the


best
 hand
 in
 those
 types
 of
 games
 Bluffs


on
 their
 own
 are
 very
 effective
 in
 other


words
 I'm
 not
 even
 using
 the
 bluff
 for


signaling
 value
 I'm
 using
 it
 just


because
 I
 can
 push
 you


around
 right
 and
 then
 I
 can
 also
 play


against
 players
 who
 are
 really
 bad
 who


pay
 you
 off
 all
 the
 time
 and
 against


those
 players
 I
 would
 never
 Bluff


because
 you're
 already
 doing
 what
 I'm


trying
 to
 get
 the
 bluff
 to
 do
 so
 I
 would


never
 Bluff
 and
 then
 in
 the
 in
 between


I'll
 Bluff
 depending
 on
 where
 I'm


sitting
 in
 that
 Spectrum
 so
 that
 was


really
 the
 discussion
 that
 I
 had
 with


Bill
 Gates
 it
 was
 a
 fun
 discussion
 I've


never
 seen
 him
 again
 since
 then
 but
 he


sat
 behind
 me
 for
 like
 an
 hour
 that's


good
 um
 now
 um
 en
 question
 are
 you


seeing
 big
 differences
 between
 when
 and


men
 and
 women
 when
 it
 comes
 to


risk-taking
 so
 in
 general
 again
 you
 know


and
 these
 are
 always
 population


differences
 right
 men
 generally
 take
 on


more
 risk
 um
 they're
 they're
 more


risk-seeking


um
 in
 general
 again
 I
 can
 take
 an


individual
 woman
 and
 an
 individual
 man


and
 the
 individual
 woman
 might
 be
 much


more
 risk-seeking
 and
 the
 individual
 man


might
 be
 more
 risk
 averse
 um
 but
 I
 I


think
 that
 uh
 I
 think
 that
 that's


generally
 true


and
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 why
 if
 I'm


thinking
 about
 like
 you
 know
 I'm


thinking
 about
 a
 trading
 desk
 and
 how
 do


you
 compose
 that
 desk
 it's
 really
 good


to
 have
 a
 mix
 why
 is
 that
 good
 because


the
 whole
 point
 of
 having
 a
 team
 is


different
 points
 of
 view
 remember
 what


what
 I
 said
 is
 like
 let's
 say
 You're


really
 bullish
 on
 a
 market
 I'm
 really


bearish
 on
 a
 market
 it's
 not
 so
 much


that
 when
 we
 have
 a
 discussion
 about


that
 that
 we
 need
 Nikolai
 and
 Annie
 to


agree
 it's
 that
 we
 want
 to
 discover


those
 different
 points
 of
 view
 so
 that


whoever
 the
 ultimate
 decision
 maker
 is


can
 see
 well
 you
 could
 model
 it
 this
 way


and
 you
 could
 model
 it
 that
 way
 right


that
 so
 that's
 where
 we're
 going
 to


learn
 all
 of
 the
 information
 so
 we
 have


equally
 informed
 people
 who
 have
 a


different
 subjective
 judgment
 about
 the


facts
 on
 the
 ground
 how
 do
 you
 get
 more


women
 onto
 the
 you
 know
 into
 portfolio


management
 positions
 on
 to
 the
 trading


desks
 and
 so
 on
 you
 know
 this
 is
 such
 a


hard


problem
 and
 I'll
 tell
 you
 I
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 give
 an
 experience
 from
 poker


so
 so
 the
 very
 first
 year
 that
 I
 played


the
 main
 event
 of
 the
 World
 Series
 of


Poker
 this
 is
 the
 Big
 World


Championship
 3%
 of
 the
 entrance
 were


women
 wow
 now
 I
 know
 right
 and
 it
 would


always
 like
 from
 year
 to
 year
 it
 would


toggle
 between
 three
 and


5%
 like
 never
 above
 five
 not
 really
 ever


below
 three


so
 you
 know
 but
 this
 was
 long
 before


poker
 was
 on
 television
 so
 now
 uh
 poker


gets
 on
 television
 and
 there's
 people


like
 me
 and
 Vanessa
 salps
 and
 Liv


bore
 and
 Maria
 ho
 and
 like
 a
 variety
 of


women
 um
 who
 are
 are
 representing
 women


and
 showing
 that
 women
 can
 do
 this


professionally
 and
 being
 very
 successful


and
 in
 my
 case
 I
 had
 four


children
 and
 I
 would
 talk
 very
 openly


about
 how
 poker
 was
 actually
 a
 pretty


good
 career
 if
 you
 have
 kids
 because


you're
 organizing
 your
 day
 where
 I
 I
 was


basically
 a
 stay-at-home
 mom
 and
 then


when
 my
 kids
 would
 go
 to
 bed
 I
 would
 go


play
 poker
 right
 so
 it
 it
 actually
 it


actually
 worked
 out
 pretty
 well
 in
 terms


of
 my
 lifestyle
 but
 anyway
 we're
 now


repping
 right
 we're
 representing
 women


in
 poker
 and
 at
 the
 time
 I
 had
 the


intuition
 and
 this
 is
 going
 back
 to
 that


thing
 about
 intuition
 how
 good
 is


intuition
 why
 you
 want
 to
 make
 it


explicit
 I
 had
 the
 intuition
 that
 it
 was


more
 that
 people
 didn't
 know
 it
 was


something
 that
 you
 could
 do
 right
 it
 was


more
 that
 people
 didn't
 know
 it
 was


something
 that
 was
 totally
 fine
 for
 a


woman
 to
 do


and
 so
 now
 it's
 been
 since
 really
 20022


2003
 that
 women
 have
 been
 featured


playing
 poker
 there's
 been
 lots
 of


success
 among
 women
 in
 poker
 and
 last


year
 in
 the


223
 Main
 Event
 of
 the
 World
 Series
 of


Poker
 the
 percentage
 of
 the
 field
 that
 W


was
 women
 was
 slightly
 over
 3%
 and
 so
 I


look
 back
 to
 that
 first
 year
 I
 played


which
 I
 think
 was


1994
 to


2023
 and
 all
 that
 happened
 in
 the


interim
 and
 yet
 there
 aren't
 more
 women


entering
 that
 event
 So
 my
 answer
 to
 you


is
 I
 don't


know
 right
 like
 I
 have
 this
 intuition


that
 if
 you
 get
 to
 people
 early
 and
 you


educate
 them
 um
 if
 you
 start
 thinking


about
 uh
 how
 do
 you
 get
 women
 like
 more


comfortable
 in
 these
 these
 very
 risky
 oh


I
 mean
 not
 risky
 in
 the
 long
 run
 but


like
 very
 riskhe
 heavy
 like
 volatile


decision-making
 environments
 that


naturally
 will
 get
 women
 to
 come
 into


those
 fields
 it's
 a
 problem
 that
 I
 would


love
 to
 solve
 but
 I
 you
 know
 at
 least
 in


poker
 I
 didn't
 see
 it
 solved
 so
 I
 the


answer
 is
 I
 don't
 know
 at
 which
 stage
 in


your
 life
 did
 you
 start
 to
 get


interested
 in
 decision-


making
 so
 I
 started
 getting
 interested


in
 decision-
 making
 actually
 in
 graduate


school
 so
 people
 think
 of
 me
 as
 a
 poker


player
 but
 they
 don't
 know
 I
 was
 an


academic
 prior
 to
 that
 so
 I
 was
 working


on
 my
 PhD
 at
 pen
 and
 I
 was
 there
 for


five
 years
 um
 working
 in
 cognitive


science
 and
 uh
 while
 my
 while
 my
 area
 of


concentration
 wasn't
 decision-making
 in


particular
 it
 was
 learning
 in
 particular


first
 language
 acquisition
 but
 I
 also


like
 took
 classes
 with
 John
 Baron
 who's


like
 a
 giant
 in
 the
 field
 of
 judgment


and
 decision-making
 so
 first
 language


acquisition
 is
 a
 problem
 of
 learning


under
 uncertainty
 so
 uh
 right
 at
 the
 end


of
 graduate
 school
 I
 ended
 up
 pivoting


uh
 for
 a
 a
 variety
 of
 reasons
 one
 of


which
 was
 some
 health
 reasons
 and
 uh


that's
 when
 I
 started
 playing
 poker
 and


for
 eight
 years
 just
 dove
 into
 this


problem
 which
 as
 we've
 discussed
 and
 we


only
 got
 the
 tip
 of
 the
 iceberg
 poker
 is


just
 this
 amazing
 laboratory
 to
 think


about
 decision-making
 under
 uncertainty


what
 goes
 wrong
 how
 can
 how
 can
 you
 make


it
 go
 right
 and
 then
 in
 2002
 I
 got
 asked


by
 a
 hedge
 fund
 to
 speak
 to
 their


Traders
 um
 about
 how
 poker
 might
 inform


risk
 and
 what
 I
 talked
 about
 what
 was


how
 poker
 and
 cognitive
 science
 informed


this
 idea
 of
 risk
 attitudes
 and


relationship
 to
 the
 path
 that
 you've


gotten
 on
 to
 your
 decision
 so
 what
 I


talked
 about
 was
 if
 you've
 been
 losing


how
 does
 that
 affect
 your
 risk
 attitude


if
 you've
 been
 winning
 how
 does
 that


affect
 your
 risk
 attitude
 so
 it
 was
 that


moment
 in
 2002
 that
 I
 really
 realized


that
 there
 was
 this
 very
 interesting


conversation
 to
 be
 had
 between
 cognitive


science
 and
 poker
 where
 the
 cognitive


science
 could
 really
 inform
 my
 thinking


about
 poker
 and
 make
 me
 a
 better
 poker


player
 and
 the
 poker
 could
 really
 form


my
 thinking
 about
 cognitive
 science
 and


make
 me
 a
 better
 cognitive
 scientist
 so


what
 I
 kind
 of
 realized
 was
 that
 from


the
 time
 I
 I
 really
 was
 in
 uh
 College


working
 as
 an
 assistant
 actually
 a


research
 assistant
 to
 a
 cognitive


science
 scientist
 what
 I've
 been
 really


obsessed
 with
 is
 this
 idea
 of


uncertainty
 and
 what
 that
 does
 to
 the


quality
 of
 your
 decisions
 and
 I
 think


because
 I
 played
 poker
 I've
 been


obsessed
 with
 how
 do
 you
 mitigate
 those


errors
 right
 it's
 not
 enough
 for
 me
 just


to
 identify
 an
 error
 I
 want
 to
 know
 how


you
 mitigate
 it
 because
 that's
 really


what
 I
 was
 obsessed
 with
 as
 a


practitioner
 what
 do
 you
 and
 what
 are


you
 curious
 about
 now
 what
 are
 you
 what


are
 you
 thinking
 about
 yeah
 what
 I'm


thinking
 about
 now
 what
 I'm
 curious


about
 now
 is
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 talk
 and
 work
 in
 the
 space
 of
 you


know
 misinformation
 and
 disinformation


which
 is
 really
 kind
 of
 coming
 from
 a


pref
 pre
 uh
 premise
 of
 people
 are
 lying


to
 you
 and
 I
 actually
 think
 that
 people


aren't
 mostly
 lying
 to
 you
 I
 think
 that


when
 people
 give
 you
 a
 data
 point
 I


think
 that
 generally
 the
 data
 that


they're
 giving
 you
 is
 probably
 going
 to


survive
 a
 fact
 check
 and
 that's


certainly
 true
 of
 data
 that
 you
 generate


within
 your
 own
 life
 and
 your
 own


business
 right
 so
 when
 someone
 tells
 you


uh
 for
 example
 that
 and
 this
 happened
 a


couple
 years
 ago
 that
 in
 in
 August
 58%


of
 the
 people
 who
 died
 of
 covid
 were


vaccinated
 you
 can
 go
 look
 that
 up
 and


it
 will
 survive
 a
 fact
 check
 so
 what


what
 I'm
 obsessed
 with
 is
 how
 do
 do
 you


model
 that
 fact
 in
 other
 words
 how
 do


you
 take
 something
 that's
 true
 and


figure
 out
 what
 the
 truth
 is
 and
 that


takes
 a
 checklist
 of
 understanding
 how


to
 model
 this
 fact
 so
 if
 we
 take
 this


fact
 of
 58%
 of
 the
 people
 who
 died
 of


covid
 were
 vaccinated
 we
 have
 to
 go


through
 a
 series
 of
 questions
 the
 most


important
 of
 which
 is
 what
 percentage
 of


the
 population
 is
 vaccinated
 because


otherwise
 what
 will
 happen
 is
 you'll
 say


oh
 vaccinations
 don't
 work
 because
 more


people
 died
 who
 were
 vaccinated
 than


were
 unvaccinated
 but
 once
 you
 know
 that


over
 80%
 of
 the
 population
 in
 that
 month


were
 vaccinated
 now
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 that


number
 looks
 very
 different
 to
 you
 and


then
 you
 could
 go
 beyond
 that
 and
 you


could
 age
 match
 you
 could
 say
 well
 let's


compare
 70
 year
 olds
 to
 70
 year
 olds
 and


so
 on
 so
 forth
 and
 then
 it
 turns
 out


vaccinations
 and
 that
 months
 were
 five


times
 better
 but
 somebody
 looking
 at


that
 nobody's
 trying
 to
 lie
 to
 you
 right


they're
 trying
 to
 give
 you
 a
 data
 point


that's
 going
 to
 help
 you
 decide
 and
 if


you
 don't
 understand
 how
 to
 model
 that


how
 can
 you
 come
 up
 with
 what
 the
 truth


of
 the
 matter
 is
 and
 I've
 been
 super


obsessed
 with
 that
 topic


recently
 well
 that
 sounds
 like
 it's


going
 to
 be
 a
 good
 book
 now
 taking
 all


your
 all
 your
 experiences
 as
 a
 poker


player
 as
 an
 academic
 uh
 and
 you
 know


having
 uh
 lived
 uh
 a
 little
 while
 what


um
 if
 you
 were
 to
 translate
 that
 into


advice
 to
 young
 people
 what
 would
 it
 be


H
 I
 would
 it
 all
 right
 so
 if
 I
 were
 to


translate
 that
 into
 advice
 for
 young


people
 look
 here
 here's
 the
 fact
 of
 your


life
 there
 are
 only
 two
 things
 that
 are


going
 to
 determine
 how
 your
 life
 turns


out
 one
 is


luck
 and
 one
 is
 the
 quality
 of
 your


decisions
 luck
 you
 have
 no
 control
 over


you
 don't
 you
 can't
 control
 the


circumstances
 of
 your
 birth
 for
 example


and
 we
 know
 that
 people
 are
 born
 into


different
 circumstances
 that
 change
 sort


of
 the
 distribution
 of
 outcomes
 that
 are


available
 to
 them
 um
 and
 you
 can't
 do


anything
 about
 that
 so
 first
 of
 all


embrace
 the
 luck
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is
 right


I
 can't
 do
 anything
 about
 it
 but
 what


you
 can
 do
 something
 about
 is
 the


quality
 of
 your
 decisions
 and
 over
 time


if
 you're
 making
 better
 decisions
 than


you
 otherwise
 would
 have
 those
 gains


will
 acre
 over
 time
 and
 it's
 going
 to


change
 that's
 the
 thing
 that
 can
 change


the
 trajectory
 of
 your
 life
 so
 it's
 this


idea


of
 while
 you
 can't
 control
 luck
 you
 are


an
 agent
 of
 your
 own


decisions
 and
 if
 you
 can
 become
 totally


focused
 on
 how
 do
 I
 improve
 the
 quality


of
 your
 decisions
 that's
 the
 thing
 that


can
 change
 your
 life
 because
 better


decisions
 lead
 to
 better
 outcomes
 for


individuals
 and
 in
 fact
 that
 also
 leads


to
 better
 outcome
 for
 society
 because


Society
 is
 a
 collection
 of
 individuals


so
 really
 start
 focusing
 on
 your


decisions
 and
 become
 an
 agent
 in
 your


own


decisions
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 great
 place


to
 end
 uh
 really
 good
 advice
 uh
 big


thanks
 to
 you
 for
 being
 uh
 for
 being
 on


this
 podcast
 and
 we
 look
 forward
 to


reading
 your
 next
 book
 well
 thank
 you
 so


much
 this
 was
 super
 fun


oh
