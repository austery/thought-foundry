Welcome
 everyone.


We
 are
 privileged
 to
 be
 joined
 by
 two


truly
 great
 investors
 today.
 I'll
 start


the
 conversation
 with
 Sir
 Chris
 Horn
 and


who
 will
 later
 then
 be
 joined
 by


Christian
 Syninding,
 CEO
 of
 EQT.


Chris,
 it's
 a
 privilege
 and
 honor
 to


have
 you.
 Welcome.
 I
 have
 to
 say
 I


completely
 agree
 with
 Nikolai,
 probably


the
 best
 investor
 Europe
 has
 ever
 seen.


To
 back
 it
 up
 with
 numbers,
 9%
 returns


above
 the
 market
 every
 single
 year
 over


a
 period
 of
 21
 years.
 Wow.


On
 on
 average.


Not
 not
 not
 every
 single
 year,
 but
 on


average.


On
 average.


So
 share
 your
 secret
 with
 us.


Well,
 um,


uh,
 strategy
 has
 been
 to
 invest
 in
 great


companies.
 Um,


um,
 but


over
 time
 I've
 come
 to


refine
 and
 understand
 better
 what
 what


that
 means.
 And
 a
 lot
 of


um,
 but
 that's
 just
 point
 one,
 find
 the


great
 companies.


Point
 two
 is


being
 concentrated.


As
 um


um
 George
 Soros
 uh
 said
 once,
 it
 doesn't


matter
 if
 you're
 right
 or
 wrong.
 All


that
 matters
 is
 how
 big
 you
 are.
 Your


position
 size
 when
 you're
 right
 and
 and


and
 your
 position
 size
 when
 you're


wrong.
 Yeah.
 If
 I'm
 right
 on
 a
 1%


position,
 it
 kind
 of
 doesn't
 make
 any


difference.
 So,
 we'll
 take
 positions
 of


10
 to
 15%,
 in
 the
 past,
 even
 25%
 of
 the


fund.
 And
 that's
 a
 double-edged
 sword.


If
 you're
 right,
 it's
 it's
 it's


fantastic.
 If
 you're
 wrong,


it's
 uh
 very
 painful.
 So
 concentration


is
 an
 important
 uh
 facet


um
 because
 there
 aren't
 hundreds
 of
 of


of
 uh
 of
 great
 ideas
 and
 um
 and


companies
 and


you
 might
 say
 that
 sounds
 risky


then
 it
 is
 and
 uh
 and
 then
 I
 would
 uh


look
 at
 um


and
 ask
 you
 well
 what
 how
 do
 you
 define


risk
 and
 the
 best
 definition
 of
 that
 was


for
 me
 given
 by
 Warren
 Buffett
 who
 we


all
 love
 and
 he
 defined
 risk
 as
 not


knowing
 what
 you're
 doing.


Now
 the
 uh
 um
 a
 lot
 of
 investors
 and


then
 the
 third
 component
 I
 would
 say
 is


long-termism.


Mhm.


Yeah.
 You
 can
 be
 you
 can
 find
 a
 great


company,
 but
 if
 your
 time
 horizon
 is,


you
 know,
 very
 short,
 you're
 you
 had
 the


vagaries
 of
 of
 what
 Kane's
 called
 the


voting
 machine.
 He
 said
 in
 the
 short


term,
 the
 market
 is
 a
 a
 voting
 machine,


and
 only
 in
 the
 long
 term
 is
 it
 a


weighing
 machine.
 And
 um
 going
 back
 to


Warren
 Buffett,
 he
 was
 asked,
 "Was


Coca-Cola
 a
 risky
 investment
 when
 you


first
 made
 it?"
 and
 he
 said
 depend
 on
 on


the
 time
 horizon
 over
 one
 year
 one
 month


very
 risky


he
 couldn't
 sell
 where
 the
 price
 would


trade
 at
 in
 in
 it
 um
 it
 doesn't


necessarily
 reflect
 fundamentals
 uh
 in


any
 short
 or
 even
 medium
 term
 and
 so


I
 do
 think
 time
 horizon
 is
 um
 a
 critical


thing
 and
 even
 intelligent
 investors


are
 are
 unable
 or
 unwilling
 to
 to
 to
 to


uh
 have
 a
 a
 long-term
 horizon
 and
 so
 and


I
 would
 put
 engagement
 as
 another


component
 of
 that
 for
 us
 of
 adding


value.
 So
 those
 uh
 and
 so
 we
 we
 we


um
 so
 find
 the
 great
 companies


focused
 or
 concentrated
 portfolio


long-termism


and
 engagement
 act
 as
 an
 owner
 in
 simple


terms.
 Um
 but
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of


investors
 get
 confused
 that
 the
 thing


that
 you
 want
 is
 growth.


Yeah.


Yeah.
 You
 know
 and


if
 you
 look
 at
 industries
 like
 airlines


they've
 been
 growing
 for
 100
 years
 maybe


5%
 a
 year
 you
 know
 fantastic
 growth
 but


collectively
 and
 cumulatively
 the


industry
 never
 made
 any
 money
 because


competition
 was
 too
 strong.
 And
 so


growth


per
 se
 growth
 by
 itself
 is


is
 not
 a
 um


a


a
 guarantee
 of
 of
 of
 making
 money.
 Um
 so


you
 need


um
 critically
 barriers
 to
 entry
 to


competition


and
 sustainable
 value
 ad
 and
 high
 value


ad.
 So
 that
 um
 so
 it's
 actually
 a


combination
 of
 barriers
 to
 entry
 and
 and


and
 um
 high
 value
 added
 um
 that
 you
 you


can
 uh
 charge
 for
 and
 uh
 and
 of
 course


then
 growth
 has
 a
 value.
 Um
 but
 the
 but


so
 everybody
 would
 agree
 with
 those


statements
 but
 the
 the
 interesting
 thing


is
 uh


um


going
 back
 again
 third
 time
 to
 Warren


Buffett
 he
 said
 most
 moes
 aren't
 worth
 a


dam


because
 you
 think
 you've
 got
 a
 moat
 but


and
 then
 it
 erodess


and
 so
 the
 real
 thing
 is
 sustainability


of
 moes
 you
 know


so
 how
 do
 you
 find
 out
 whether
 a
 great


company
 remains
 a
 great
 company
 over


time


Yeah.
 Well,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 is
 to


understand
 the
 um
 so
 you
 know


the
 forces
 of
 competition
 and
 and


substitution
 and
 disruption
 are
 very


powerful
 and
 and
 we've
 learned
 just
 as


in
 the
 same
 way
 people
 underestimate


complexity
 structurally,


most
 investors
 underestimate
 the
 forces


of
 competition
 and
 disruption.
 Why?


because
 they're
 short-term.


Mhm.


Keeps
 going
 back
 to
 the
 same
 root
 causes


and
 um


we're
 um
 um
 so


we
 learn
 through
 examples
 and
 uh
 uh


through
 sometimes
 experience
 and


suffering.
 Um,
 one
 of
 my
 investments
 30


years
 ago
 when
 before
 I
 started
 TCI
 was


with
 a
 European
 media
 company
 that
 um,


Bane
 Capital
 had
 bought
 control
 of
 and


uh,
 uh,
 it
 was
 a
 monopoly
 and
 uh,
 they


boughted
 control.
 It
 was
 like
 a
 billion


euro
 valuation
 and
 uh


um
 and
 the
 stock
 went
 to
 a
 50
 billion


valuation
 1
 billion
 to
 50
 billion
 and


then
 it
 went
 to
 zero
 and
 it
 was
 a
 a


yellow
 pages
 company
 in
 Italy
 because


the
 internet
 hadn't
 been
 found
 it
 was


people
 thought
 it
 was
 a
 resilient


monopoly
 but


you
 know
 something
 Google
 destroyed
 the


company
 so


we


we
 sometimes
 don't
 know
 Yeah,
 we
 can't


know
 what
 hasn't
 been
 invented.
 So
 then


how
 can
 you
 know
 anything?
 You
 might


say,
 "Yeah,


it
 was
 uh


Chenia
 said,
 "Yeah,
 unknown
 unknown."
 So


you
 know
 the
 you
 don't
 know
 what
 you


don't
 know.
 But
 uh
 the
 um


so


but
 certain
 industries
 are
 more
 prone
 to


disruption
 than
 others.
 your
 risk
 is


much
 higher


and
 uh
 and
 so


we
 try
 to
 avoid
 those
 those
 sectors


because
 you're
 asking
 for
 trouble
 or


limit
 our
 exposure


and
 um
 one
 of
 those
 sectors
 uh
 is


technology.


Yeah.
 So
 what
 are
 the
 ones
 you
 like?


I've
 always
 liked
 as
 one
 example


infrastructure.


Mhm.
 where
 they're
 in
 which
 is


bit
 unusual
 you
 know
 um


it's
 not
 that
 sexy
 it's
 a
 bit
 boring


owning
 toll
 roads
 and
 airports
 and


transmission
 lines
 um
 cell
 phone
 towers


and
 uh
 but
 I
 um


I
 I


was
 born
 into
 a
 poor
 family
 and
 uh
 so
 I


always


wanted
 to
 get
 my
 capital
 back.


I
 thought
 that
 was
 a
 good
 starting


point.
 Don't
 lose
 your
 capital.
 And
 so
 I


I
 sort
 of
 believed
 in
 physical
 asset


backing.
 Yeah.
 Which
 most
 investors


don't
 look
 at
 tangible
 book
 value.


That's
 something


you
 know
 forgotten
 in
 economic
 textbooks


as
 a
 as
 a
 as
 a
 as
 a
 metric
 but
 or
 a


placement
 value.
 But
 um
 you
 know
 an


example


is
 uh
 maybe
 10
 years
 ago,
 nine
 years
 ago


um


um
 the
 Spanish
 government
 approached
 us


and
 and
 about
 taking
 an
 anchor
 position


in
 an
 IPO
 of
 their
 airport
 Aena
 and
 uh


um


airport
 was
 basically
 brand
 new,
 huge


under
 capacity


um
 and
 75
 5%
 of
 the
 the
 the
 value
 was
 in


unregulated
 shops
 and
 car
 parks
 and
 uh


you
 know
 complete
 monopoly
 unregulated


and
 uh
 huge
 growth
 potential
 and
 they


sold
 it
 at
 a
 15%
 free
 cash
 flow
 yield


and
 uh
 and
 what
 we
 could
 see
 is
 that
 you


could
 never
 replace
 these
 assets
 Madrid


airport
 and
 Barcelona
 airport
 and


irreplaceable


and
 um
 and
 they
 sold
 at
 the
 right
 price.


Valuation
 matters.
 They
 sold
 it
 a
 15%


free
 cash
 flow
 yield.


Um


and
 um


so
 I
 learned
 I
 learned
 at
 school
 that
 a


great
 company
 is
 not
 necessarily
 a
 great


investment,
 but
 you
 look
 at
 something


like
 cash
 flow
 yield
 to
 tell
 you
 now


it's
 a
 good
 time
 to
 buy.


And
 sometimes
 people
 say
 it's
 things
 are


cheap
 for
 a
 reason.


Mhm.


Now
 people
 were
 concerned
 about


government
 ownership
 in
 this
 case


regulation
 and


um
 and
 the
 government
 did
 uh
 impact
 it.


They
 limited
 the
 compensation
 of
 the
 CEO


to
 â‚¬200,000
 euros
 and
 ultimately
 the
 CEO


left
 because
 he
 was
 a
 very
 good
 CEO
 the


original
 and
 so
 um


but
 I
 it
 didn't
 matter
 because
 the


monopoly
 was
 there
 the
 assets
 were
 there


so
 I
 like
 asset
 backing
 um
 of


infrastructure


another
 sector
 that
 we've


can
 I
 just
 ask
 you
 one
 question
 on
 this


if
 you
 like
 an
 asset


hm
 the
 physical
 asset.


Does
 management
 quality
 matter?
 Is
 it


important?


Less
 so.


Mhm.


It
 matters
 for
 reinvestment
 risk.


And


but
 one
 of
 the
 things
 um
 I
 mentioned


that
 we


do
 is
 we're
 act
 as
 owners.
 We
 have


people
 have
 different


terms
 for
 that
 constructivist
 and


activist
 but
 I
 really
 think


fundamentally
 it's
 acting
 as
 an
 owner


and


in
 the
 case
 of
 then
 and
 we
 were
 worried


we
 didn't
 have
 any
 control
 and
 um
 but
 we


had
 influence
 I
 I
 I
 I


was
 asked
 to
 be
 on
 the
 board
 I
 was
 on


the
 board
 for
 three
 years
 of
 the
 of
 the


airport
 company
 and
 we
 went
 to
 the


government


and
 to
 the
 board
 and
 and and
 said,


"Look,
 you're
 throwing
 out
 all
 this
 cash


flow,
 billions
 of
 euros
 of
 cash.
 You


don't
 need
 it.
 We
 want
 to
 propose
 an
 80%


dividend
 payout
 ratio."


And
 for
 you,
 that's
 dividends
 you
 can


spend.
 And
 and
 and
 they
 agreed
 to
 it.


Mhm.


And
 so
 my
 reinvestment
 risk
 of


management
 was
 limited
 then,
 very


limited.
 And
 uh
 and
 so
 there
 are
 things


you
 can
 do
 if
 uh
 to
 mitigate
 risk.


Mh.
 Um
 and


but
 it
 does
 matter.
 You
 know,
 another


infrastructure
 asset
 uh


we've
 been
 invested
 in
 is
 is
 in
 the
 toll


road
 sector
 for
 OVL.
 It's
 where
 there's


a
 family
 that
 have
 about
 a
 quarter
 of
 a


stake
 and
 they're
 fantastic
 capital


allocators.
 They
 just
 reinvest.
 They


sold
 Heathrow
 airport
 recently


and
 uh
 you
 know
 at
 a
 low
 return
 and


they're
 reinvesting
 in
 Monopoly
 toll


roads
 at
 high
 returns
 and
 they
 just


really
 know
 their
 business
 and
 uh
 have


high
 alignment
 of
 interest.
 So
 um
 but


you
 know
 again
 Buffett
 said
 you've
 got


to
 indeed
 you
 should
 invest
 in
 an


industry
 where


yes
 a
 monkey
 could
 run
 it
 because
 one


day
 they
 will.
 Mhm.


And
 so,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 I
 I
 want
 to
 find


an
 asset
 where
 because,
 you
 know,


there's
 no
 guarantee
 the
 CEO's
 comes


back.
 Yeah.
 Yep.
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 you


have
 to
 invest
 in
 an
 in
 a
 business
 where


it's
 a
 great
 business
 and
 uh
 it
 doesn't


depend
 on
 the
 manager.
 Um
 because


there's
 no,
 you
 know,
 the
 assets
 are


ultimately


more
 reliable
 than
 than
 the
 manager.
 So


um
 but
 you
 know
 so
 in
 in
 this
 sort
 of


where
 are
 the
 moes
 you
 we
 talked
 about


infrastructure
 and
 physical


non-replicable
 assets
 another
 space
 we


like
 as
 an
 example
 is
 aerospace


things
 like
 aircraft
 engines
 and
 um


manufacturers
 like
 G
 aerospace
 and


saffron


and
 we
 like
 that
 space
 because
 the


barriers
 to
 entry
 are
 extremely
 high


um
 in
 terms
 of
 intellectual
 property


the
 the
 it's
 so
 complicated
 to
 make
 this


product
 that
 there've
 been
 no
 new


entrance
 for
 50
 years.


Yeah.


So
 new
 entrance
 is
 a
 sign
 of
 uh


the
 barriers
 to
 entry.
 It's
 one
 of
 the


the
 uh
 the
 criteria
 you
 can
 look
 at.


Um
 so
 um
 and
 um
 the
 uh
 and
 why
 is
 that?


Not
 only
 is
 it
 very
 complicated


um
 you
 make
 the
 money
 in
 the
 spare


parts.
 So
 once
 you've
 got
 this
 installed


base,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 the
 the
 new


engines
 are
 only
 a
 small
 percentage
 and


the
 airframers
 only
 want
 one
 or
 two


engines.
 It's
 too
 complicated
 otherwise


who
 there
 isn't
 the
 room
 for
 for
 for


multiple
 competitors.


Mhm.


Uh
 and
 so
 um
 and
 then


for
 various
 reasons
 uh
 that
 uh
 it's
 very


difficult
 for
 competitors
 to
 enter
 the


the
 replacement
 parts
 and
 so
 the


switching
 costs.
 Yeah.
 So
 that's
 another


uh
 space
 where
 very
 intellectual


property
 is
 uh
 can
 be
 of
 a
 barrier.


Fascinating.
