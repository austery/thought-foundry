So
 just
 over
 a
 year
 ago,
 for
 the
 third


time
 in
 my
 life,
 I
 ceased
 to
 exist.
 I


was
 having
 a
 small
 operation.
 My
 brain


was
 filling
 with
 anesthetic.


I
 remember
 a
 sense
 of
 detachment
 and


falling
 apart
 and
 coldness.


And
 then
 I
 was
 back
 drowsy
 and


disoriented,
 but
 but
 definitely
 there.


Now,
 when
 you
 wake
 from
 a
 deep
 sleep,


you
 might
 feel
 confused
 about
 the
 time


or
 anxious
 about
 oversleeping,
 but


there's
 always
 a
 basic
 sense
 of
 time


having
 passed,
 of
 a
 continuity
 between


then
 and
 now.
 And
 coming
 around
 from


anesthesia
 is
 very
 different.
 I
 could


have
 been
 under
 for
 five
 minutes,
 five


hours,
 five
 years,
 or
 even
 50
 years.
 I


simply
 wasn't
 there.
 Was
 total
 oblivion.


Anesthesia,
 it's
 a
 modern
 kind
 of
 magic.


It
 turns
 people
 into
 objects
 and
 then
 we


hope
 back
 again
 into
 people.
 And
 in
 this


process
 is
 one
 of
 the
 greatest
 remaining


mysteries
 in
 science
 and
 philosophy.
 How


does
 consciousness
 happen?
 Somehow


within
 each
 of
 our
 brains,
 the
 combined


activity
 of
 many
 billions
 of
 neurons,


each
 one
 a
 tiny
 biological
 machine
 is


generating
 a
 conscious
 experience.
 And


not
 just
 any
 conscious
 experience,
 your


conscious
 experience
 right
 here
 and


right
 now.
 How
 does
 this
 happen?
 Well,


answering
 this
 question
 is
 so
 important


because
 consciousness
 for
 each
 of
 us
 is


all
 there
 is.
 Without
 it,
 there's
 no


world,
 there's
 no
 self,
 there's
 nothing


at
 all.


Hi,
 I'm
 Annil
 Seth.
 I'm
 a
 professor
 of


neuroscience
 at
 the
 University
 of
 Sussex


and
 the
 author
 of
 the
 book
 Being
 You:
 A


New
 Science
 of
 Consciousness.
 The
 first


question
 that
 I
 have
 for
 you
 is
 for
 a


regular
 person
 just
 going
 about
 their


day-to-day.


Why
 is
 it
 important
 to
 think
 about


consciousness?
 Why
 does
 it
 matter?


>> It's
 really
 easy
 to
 take
 it
 for
 granted,


isn't
 it?
 I
 mean,
 we
 we
 just
 are
 who
 we


are
 and
 the
 world
 is
 how
 it
 is
 and
 we


get
 on
 with
 our
 daily
 lives.
 But
 I
 think


if
 you
 just
 reflect
 on
 it
 for
 a
 little


bit
 and
 actually
 think
 children
 are
 very


good
 at
 this
 cuz
 I
 remember
 first


getting
 interested
 in
 consciousness
 as
 a


child.
 I
 think
 as
 many
 of
 us
 are
 like


why
 am
 I
 me
 and
 not
 somebody
 else?


Questions
 like
 that.
 What
 happens
 when
 I


die?
 But
 this
 moment
 of
 reflection


suggests
 I
 think
 makes
 it
 clear
 that


everything
 that
 matters
 to
 us
 matters


through
 the
 medium
 of
 conscious


experience.
 You
 know
 we
 feel
 good,
 we


feel
 bad,
 we
 see
 something
 beautiful,
 we


see
 something
 ugly,
 we
 uh
 without


experiencing
 the
 world
 and
 the
 self,


nothing
 really
 matters
 at
 all.
 So
 I


think
 it's
 it's
 a
 central


um
 concept.
 It's
 a
 central
 aspect
 of


what
 it
 means
 to
 be
 a
 living
 human


being.
 There
 are
 plenty
 of
 other
 reasons


why
 why
 it's
 important.
 Plenty
 of
 other


practical
 applications
 and
 you
 it's
 not


just
 the
 realm
 of
 of
 philosophy.


It
 it
 matters
 in
 our
 daily
 lives.
 I


think
 that's
 fundamentally
 why
 we
 should


be
 interested
 in
 it.
 One
 of
 the
 uh
 the


many
 things
 that
 I
 admire
 about
 your


work
 is
 how
 you
 take
 really
 big
 complex


ideas
 and
 you
 don't
 um
 oversimplify
 them


but
 you
 do
 make
 them
 accessible.
 Um
 and


so
 as
 we
 are
 going
 to
 have
 this


conversation
 that
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to


touch
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 of
 of
 big
 complex


ideas
 about
 consciousness
 and
 conscious


experience.
 Let's
 actually
 get
 started


with
 what
 I
 found
 in
 your
 book
 and
 in


just
 thinking
 about
 these
 ideas
 to
 be


one
 of
 the
 easiest
 most
 concrete


immediate
 examples
 which
 is
 to
 think


about
 color,
 right?
 That
 we
 have
 a


conscious
 experience
 of
 say
 the
 color


red
 or
 the
 color
 green.


And
 we
 all
 think
 that
 we
 understand
 what


that
 is.
 And
 yet
 it's
 possible,
 in
 fact,


it's
 quite
 likely
 that
 other
 people's


perception
 of
 those
 exact
 same
 colors
 is


not
 the
 exact
 same
 as
 ours.
 that
 their


experience
 of
 the
 world,
 their
 conscious


experience
 is
 not
 the
 same
 as
 ours.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 it's
 not
 only
 likely,
 it


just
 is
 the
 case.
 There's
 that
 example,


I
 think.
 Um,
 do
 you
 remember
 it,
 Chris?


I
 don't
 know
 if
 people
 listening
 to
 this


will,
 but
 about
 10
 years
 ago,
 there
 was


this
 photo
 of
 a
 dress
 that
 half
 the


world
 saw
 as
 yellow
 and
 white
 and
 the


other
 half
 saw
 us
 as
 blue
 and
 black.
 And


that's
 a
 very
 clear
 example
 of
 how
 you


can
 have
 exact
 the
 same
 exact
 stimulus,


the
 same
 image,
 uh,
 but
 we
 can
 have
 a


very
 different
 subjective
 experience.


I
 think
 color
 is
 an
 excellent
 example


that
 gets
 us
 into
 this
 whole
 issue
 of
 of


consciousness
 and
 why
 it's
 important


because,
 as
 you
 said,
 it's
 it
 we
 take
 it


for
 granted.
 We're
 we
 walk
 around
 the


world
 and
 things
 are
 red
 or
 things
 are


green,
 the
 sky
 is
 blue.
 exist
 that
 out


there
 in
 the
 world
 independently
 of
 us.


But
 we
 know
 that's
 not
 true.
 And
 this
 is


even
 before
 neuroscience
 gets
 going


really
 from
 physics.
 We
 know
 that
 the


electromagnetic
 spectrum
 uh
 goes
 all
 the


way
 from
 radio
 waves
 which
 are
 very
 long


um
 to
 x-rays,
 gamma
 rays
 which
 are


really
 short.
 And
 this
 so-called
 visible


spectrum
 is
 somewhere
 in
 the
 middle.


It's
 a
 thin
 slice
 of
 reality.
 And
 what's


more,
 within
 that
 thin
 slice
 of
 reality,


we
 just
 have
 uh
 cells
 that
 are
 sensitive


to
 more
 or
 less
 three
 different


wavelengths.
 We
 call
 them
 red,
 green,


and
 blue,
 but
 they're
 not
 actually


colored.
 They're
 just
 three
 wavelengths


of
 electromagnetic
 radiation.
 And
 out
 of


those
 three
 wavelengths,
 the
 brain


conjures
 up
 in
 millions
 of
 different


colors.
 So
 it's
 color
 just
 is
 not
 there


out
 there
 in
 the
 world
 in
 the
 way
 that


it
 seems.
 But
 it's
 also
 not
 made
 up.
 You


know
 what's
 happening
 as
 far
 as
 people


who
 study
 this
 stuff
 in
 in
 detail
 uh


think
 is
 that
 what
 we
 experience
 as


color
 is
 a
 sort
 of
 property
 of
 how


different
 surfaces
 reflect
 light
 in
 in


different
 ways.
 And
 that's
 why
 color
 is


useful
 for
 us
 because
 it
 helps
 us
 keep


track
 of
 objects
 when
 lighting


conditions
 change
 and
 when
 things


change.
 It's
 very
 useful
 thing
 for
 our


visual
 systems
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do.
 But


it's
 not
 this
 direct
 transduction
 of


something
 that
 exists
 in
 objective


reality.
 It
 requires
 a
 brain
 and
 a
 world


to
 experience
 color.
 One
 of the
 other


reasons
 why
 I
 think
 color
 is
 such
 an


interesting
 place
 to
 start
 is
 because
 my


personal
 experience
 here
 is
 I
 am
 color


blind.
 And
 so
 I
 struggle
 to


differentiate
 between
 colors
 certain


colors
 that
 many
 other
 people
 feel
 are


very
 clearly
 different.
 So
 to
 me
 my


experience
 of
 the
 world
 does
 not
 include


this
 bright
 line
 between
 say
 lavender


and
 light
 blue.
 um
 certain
 types
 of


green
 and
 brown
 are
 are
 more
 on
 a


spectrum
 to
 me.
 And
 so
 um
 rather
 than


like
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 a
 clear


difference
 between
 them.
 And
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 happens
 whenever
 people
 find


out
 that
 I'm
 color
 blind
 is
 we
 play
 this


game.
 It's
 it's
 like
 unavoidable.
 And
 it


doesn't
 bother
 me.
 I
 know
 it
 bothers


some
 other
 color
 blind
 people,
 but
 um
 we


end
 up
 playing
 this
 game
 where
 they


point
 at
 all
 the
 things
 around
 us
 and


they
 say,
 "And
 what
 color
 is
 that?
 And


what
 color
 is
 that?
 And
 what
 color
 is


that?
 And
 what
 does
 this
 look
 like?"
 and


they're
 amazed
 that
 it's
 not
 always
 the


same
 for
 me
 as
 it
 is
 for
 them.


>> I
 mean,
 mo
 most
 people
 uh
 the
 most


common
 form
 of
 color
 blindness
 and
 see


if
 this
 resonates
 with
 you
 is
 is
 when


what
 non-colorblind
 people


would
 say
 is
 red
 and
 then
 say
 is
 green.


Uh
 people
 with
 the
 most
 common
 form
 of


color
 blindness
 would
 perceive
 those


things
 as
 being,
 you
 know,
 roughly
 the


same.


>> Yes,
 it's
 a
 red
 green
 color
 blindness.
 I


don't
 I
 will
 say
 that
 that
 doesn't
 that


example
 is
 not
 what
 plays
 out
 the
 most


in
 my
 everyday
 life.
 It
 tends
 to
 be
 the


blue
 and
 lavender
 are
 that's
 the
 one


that
 comes
 up
 a
 lot
 where
 it's
 very
 hard


for
 me
 to
 tell
 the
 difference.
 Say
 the


color
 of
 a
 shirt.
 Um
 or
 there
 are
 these


photos
 online
 every
 once
 in
 a
 while


there'll
 be
 these
 photos
 that
 kind
 of
 go


viral
 which
 is
 like
 how
 the
 world
 looks


to
 someone
 with
 red
 green
 color


blindness.
 And
 it'll
 be
 two
 photos
 that


I'm
 told
 to
 someone
 who
 does
 not
 have


this
 look
 very
 different.
 And
 to
 me,


those
 photos
 look
 exactly
 the
 same.
 I


could
 not
 tell
 you
 which
 one
 is
 the


altered
 one.


>> You
 know,
 the
 philosopher
 Thomas
 Nagel


years
 ago,
 50
 years
 ago,
 actually,
 wrote


this
 uh
 this
 wonderful
 essay
 called,


"What
 is
 it
 like
 to
 be
 a
 bat?"
 Now,
 I'm


not
 saying
 being
 color
 blind
 is
 like


being
 a
 bat.
 No.
 But
 his
 point
 was
 that,


you
 know,
 for
 each
 of
 us,
 we
 have
 our


subjective
 world,
 and


that
 is
 unique
 to
 us.
 You
 know,


everybody's
 world
 will
 be
 different.
 The


subjective
 world
 of
 a
 bat
 is
 going
 to
 be


very
 different
 because
 they
 have


echolocation
 and
 all
 this
 other
 stuff.


And
 the
 subjective
 world
 of
 someone
 with


color
 blinds
 of
 Eucharist
 is
 going
 to
 be


different
 with
 respect
 to
 color.
 Last


week
 or
 the
 week
 before,
 there
 was
 this


amazing
 new
 experiment
 published
 by
 I


think
 it
 has
 a
 lab
 in
 in
 the
 US
 where


they
 use
 lasers
 to
 stimulate
 one
 class


of
 uh
 cell
 in
 the
 retina
 in
 the
 eye
 um


that
 normally
 would
 never
 be
 activated


just
 by
 itself.
 And
 they
 claimed
 they


created
 a
 brand
 new
 color
 that
 no
 one


had
 ever
 experienced
 in
 the
 world


before.
 And
 of
 course
 then
 they
 tried
 to


describe
 it
 and
 it
 was
 it's
 kind
 of
 fun


like
 how
 do
 you
 describe
 a
 color
 that


that
 the
 claims
 literally
 has
 never
 been


seen
 before?
 You
 know
 words
 almost


necessarily
 are
 going
 to
 fail.
 We
 use


strooscopic
 light
 in
 my
 lab
 which
 is


another
 way
 of
 creating
 very
 unusual


visual
 experiences.
 And
 again
 in
 those


conditions
 people
 report
 sometimes


experiencing
 colors
 that
 they've
 never


seen
 before.
 in
 in
 being
 you
 a
 new


science
 of
 consciousness.
 You
 describe


one
 idea
 of
 of
 seeing
 the
 world
 as
 as


controlled
 hallucination.
 So
 can
 you


define
 that
 and
 talk
 to
 us
 about
 about


that
 because
 I
 feel
 like
 it
 really
 ties


in
 with
 what
 we're
 talking
 about.


>> The
 idea
 of
 controlled
 hallucination
 is


is
 not
 just
 an
 account
 of
 how
 we


experience
 color.
 I
 mean
 the
 power
 of


the
 idea
 at least
 for
 me
 and
 as
 I
 try
 to


explain
 in
 the
 book
 it's
 a
 way
 of


understanding
 everything
 that
 we


experience
 whether
 it's
 an
 emotion
 or
 a


sense
 of
 free
 will
 or
 the
 sense
 of
 being


Chris
 or
 or
 being
 Annel.
 It's
 a
 it's


it's
 a
 way
 of
 understanding
 everything


that
 we
 experience
 whatsoever.
 The
 idea


is
 is
 pretty
 simple
 and
 it's
 pretty
 old.


I
 mean,
 in
 thinking
 about
 color,
 it's


already
 clear
 that
 what
 we
 experience


isn't
 this
 direct
 readout
 of
 what's


objectively
 out
 there
 in
 the
 world,


because
 colors
 aren't
 objectively
 out


there
 in
 the
 world.
 But
 now,
 let's


switch
 perspective
 a
 little
 bit
 and


think
 about
 what
 things
 are
 like
 from


the
 perspective
 of
 a
 brain.
 So,
 imagine


being
 a
 brain.
 A
 brain
 is
 locked
 inside


this
 bony
 vault
 of
 a
 skull.
 And
 you
 know


to
 a
 first
 approximation
 what
 it's


trying
 to
 do
 is
 figure
 out
 what
 the
 hell


is
 going
 on
 out
 there
 in
 the
 world
 or
 in


here
 in
 the
 body.
 All
 the
 brain
 has
 to


go
 on
 are
 these
 electrical
 sensory


signals
 that
 arrive
 via
 the
 eyes
 and
 the


ears
 and
 so
 on.
 And
 light
 doesn't
 just


get
 right
 into
 the
 brain.
 It's
 dark
 in


the
 brain
 and
 it's
 silent.
 All
 the
 brain


has
 are
 electrical
 signals
 that
 are
 only


indirectly
 related
 to
 the
 things
 out


there
 in
 the
 world.
 They
 don't
 have


labels.
 So
 the
 brain
 has
 to
 infer,
 has


to
 make
 a
 best
 guess
 about
 what
 is


happening
 in
 the
 world
 based
 on
 these


ambiguous,
 unlabeled,
 uncolored,


unounded


sensory
 signals.
 The
 brain


makes
 this
 best
 guess
 about
 what's


happening
 in
 the
 world
 by
 continually


making
 predictions
 about
 the
 sensory


signals
 that
 it's
 getting.
 And
 then


instead
 of
 just
 reading
 out
 the
 sensory


signals
 to
 sort
 of
 form
 this
 inner


picture
 of
 the
 world,
 the
 brain
 is


continually
 updating
 the
 predictions.
 So


they
 explain
 away
 um
 the
 sensory
 signals


that
 are
 coming
 in.
 And
 the
 key
 idea


here
 is
 that
 what
 we
 experience


in
 this
 story
 is
 the
 content
 of
 these


inside
 out
 predictions.
 We
 don't
 read


out
 the
 world
 from
 the
 outside
 in.
 We


always
 actively
 construct
 it,
 actively


generate
 it
 from
 the
 inside
 out.
 Now
 it


turns
 out
 math
 if
 you
 do
 all
 the
 maths


and
 all
 this
 stuff
 that
 if
 you
 have
 a


brain
 which
 is
 continually
 updating
 its


top
 down
 inside
 out
 predictions
 to


minimize
 you
 know
 the
 the
 sensory


signals
 that
 are
 coming
 in
 to
 try
 and


you
 know
 explain
 them
 predict
 them


before
 they
 happen.
 That
 mathematically


is
 a
 very
 very
 good
 way
 for
 the
 brain
 to


um
 approximate


exactly
 what
 caused
 the
 sensory
 signals


out
 there
 in
 the
 world.
 It's
 a
 very
 good


way
 to
 make
 a
 best
 guess.
 And
 that's
 the


claim.
 That's
 what
 we
 experience.
 And


that's
 why
 I
 call
 it
 a
 controlled


hallucination,
 which
 is
 a
 term,
 you


know,
 like
 all
 good
 analogies.
 But
 I


like
 the
 idea
 because
 it
 emphasizes


that


our
 experiences
 come
 largely
 from


within.
 Uh
 so
 that's
 the
 hallucination


part.


>> A
 way
 for
 me
 to
 understand
 this
 inside


out
 and
 outside
 in
 dance
 is
 I
 see


something
 exciting
 and
 my
 heart
 starts


pounding
 and
 my
 heart
 is
 pounding


because
 I
 am
 excited.
 And
 then
 there's


also
 the
 idea
 that
 I
 see
 something
 and


my
 heart
 starts
 pounding
 and
 then
 my


brain
 has
 to
 decide
 are
 your
 is
 your


heart
 pounding
 because
 you
 are
 terrified


or
 because
 you
 are
 excited
 and
 that


increasingly
 the
 the
 science
 seems
 to
 be


pointing
 towards
 the
 second
 rather
 than


the
 first.
 That's
 right.
 There's
 a


theory
 of
 emotion
 from
 William
 James
 who


who
 like
 many
 theories
 in
 psychology


came
 up
 with
 these
 ideas
 back
 in
 the


19th
 century.
 But
 it
 was
 it
 was
 James


and
 another
 guy
 called
 Carl
 Langanger


who
 first
 put
 things
 this
 way
 and
 they


gave
 the
 example
 of
 seeing
 a
 bear.
 So


you
 see
 a
 grizzly
 bear
 or
 something,
 you


feel
 very
 afraid
 and
 adrenaline
 starts


coursing
 through
 your
 body
 and
 so
 you


run
 away.
 Um,
 and
 in
 this
 way
 of


thinking
 about
 it,
 you
 know,
 you
 see
 the


bear,
 that
 causes
 an
 emotion
 of
 fear,


and
 the
 emotion
 of
 fear
 sets
 and
 train


all
 these
 bodily
 responses
 that
 allow


you
 to
 to
 run
 away
 or
 fight
 if
 you
 you


really
 want
 to
 fight
 a
 grizzly
 bear,


which
 is
 bad
 idea.
 Um,
 and
 James
 kind
 of


flipped
 that
 and
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 the


same
 kind
 of
 flip.
 So
 what
 James


suggested
 was
 going
 on
 was
 that
 what
 we


experience
 as
 the
 emotion
 of
 fear
 is


more
 is
 mostly
 the
 brain's
 perception
 of


the
 body's
 response
 to
 the
 bear.
 So
 the


chain
 of
 causation
 is
 now
 subtly
 but


importantly
 different.
 We
 see
 a
 bear,


brain
 registers
 there's
 a
 bear
 cuz


that's
 its
 best
 controlled
 hallucination


of
 what's
 out
 there
 in
 the
 world.
 I
 mean


that
 itself
 is
 is
 still
 an
 inference.


That
 visual
 perception
 of
 the
 bear


immediately
 sets
 in
 train
 all
 these


physiological


changes
 in
 the
 body,
 cortisol,


adrenaline,
 all
 of
 that.
 And
 then
 it's


the
 brain's
 perception
 of
 these
 changes


in
 the
 context
 of
 a
 bear
 being
 present


that
 is
 the
 emotion
 of
 of
 fear.


And
 this
 is
 is
 a
 useful
 way
 to
 think


about
 it
 because
 the
 interior
 of
 the


body
 you
 know
 the
 state
 of
 the
 body
 even


on
 the
 body
 on
 the
 inside
 the
 brain
 has


to
 infer
 that
 too.
 One
 of
 the
 aha


moments
 for
 me
 was
 to
 think
 of
 this


James
 theory
 of
 emotion
 as
 actually


basically
 identical
 to
 these
 ideas
 about


how
 visual
 perception
 works.
 So
 just
 as


the
 brain
 has
 to
 infer
 the
 causes
 of
 its


visual
 signals
 and
 that's
 what
 we
 see.


It's
 making
 predictions
 about
 what's
 out


there.
 The
 exact
 same
 mechanism
 can
 do


what
 James
 was
 suggesting
 happens.
 it


can
 make
 its
 best
 guess
 about
 what's


happening
 in
 the
 inside
 of
 the
 body
 and


that
 becomes
 experiences
 of
 emotion.
 And


that's
 kind
 of
 satisfying
 from
 a
 a
 sort


of
 if
 you're
 a
 theory
 person,
 it's
 very


satisfying
 because
 you
 got
 one
 simple


principle,
 the
 brain
 making
 and
 updating


predictions
 that
 can
 now
 bring
 together


what
 were
 previously
 two
 quite
 different


fields
 of
 understanding
 human


experience.
 you
 know,
 visual
 perception


on
 the
 one
 hand
 and
 emotion
 on
 the


other.
 And
 I
 I
 very
 I
 find
 very


appealing
 when
 you
 have
 these
 unifying


principles
 and
 you
 can
 start
 to


understand
 you
 know
 different
 domains
 of


human
 experience
 through
 the
 same


underlying
 mechanism.
 I
 think
 that
 many


people
 especially
 in
 the
 in
 the
 western


world
 they
 often
 have
 this
 idea
 of
 the


brain
 as
 like
 a


supercomput
 like
 a
 a
 very
 uh
 hyper


intelligent
 machine
 that
 is
 processing


information
 and
 they


that
 image
 of
 the
 brain
 is
 is
 often


quite
 separate
 from
 the
 rest
 of
 the


body.
 It
 seems
 to
 me
 like
 you
 are
 saying


that
 it
 it
 is
 quite
 a
 bit
 more
 like
 the


full
 body
 experience
 than
 just
 the


locked
 away
 supercomput
 in
 in
 the
 top.
 I


think
 this
 idea
 of
 the
 brain
 as
 a


computer
 has
 been
 an
 extremely
 powerful


metaphor.
 Um
 but
 it's
 reaching
 its


limits.
 You
 know
 the
 brain
 is
 this
 is


pretty
 implacable
 in
 its
 complexity.
 And


I
 think
 scientists
 have
 always
 struggled


to
 figure
 out
 how
 how
 can
 we


conceptualize
 what's
 what's
 happening
 in


this
 gray
 goo
 inside
 our
 heads.
 And
 um


initially
 it
 was
 a
 system
 of
 pipes
 and


plumbing
 and
 then
 a
 telephone
 network.


And
 since
 the
 1950s
 this
 metaphor
 of
 a


computer
 has
 been
 very
 powerful.
 So


powerful
 that
 that
 we
 just
 sort
 of
 take


it
 for
 granted
 that
 the
 brain
 computes


and
 processes
 information.
 And
 um
 you


know
 if
 you
 programmed
 a
 computer
 a
 real


you
 know
 silicon
 computer
 in
 the
 right


way
 you'd
 get
 everything
 that
 you
 get


from
 real
 brains
 including
 and
 we'll


come
 back
 to
 this
 consciousness
 and
 this


is
 where
 I
 start
 to
 get
 really


uncomfortable
 about
 this
 metaphor
 but


the
 computer


relies
 on
 something
 to
 implement
 the


computations
 but
 it's
 it's
 you
 it's
 not


nearly
 as
 intimately
 related
 to
 the
 body


as
 you
 know
 our
 brains
 are
 related
 to


our
 physical


bodies.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 super


important
 if
 we're
 ever
 to
 really


understand
 how
 brains
 work
 and
 and
 what


they're
 for.
 You
 know,
 the
 body
 isn't


just
 this
 kind
 of
 meat-based
 robot
 that


can
 take
 our
 brain
 computer
 from
 one


meeting
 to
 the
 next.
 If
 you,
 you
 know,


zoom
 backwards
 in
 evolutionary
 time,


every
 brain
 that
 ever
 existed


evolved
 to
 control
 and
 regulate
 and


guide
 a
 body.
 That's
 what
 brains
 are


fundamentally
 for.
 I'm
 inclined
 to
 think


that
 we've
 reached
 the
 limits
 of
 the


brain
 as
 computer
 metaphor.
 And
 the


brain
 is
 actually
 much
 richer,
 much
 more


complex
 than
 computers.
 There's
 one
 key


difference
 that
 that
 I'll
 just
 mention


and
 then
 I
 would
 love
 to
 see
 what
 you


think
 of
 it,
 which
 is
 a
 key
 principle
 of


all
 the
 computers
 we
 have
 um
 is
 that
 we


have
 this
 sharp
 separation
 between


software
 and
 hardware.
 I
 can
 run
 the


same
 version
 of
 of
 whatever
 it
 is
 um


Word
 on
 my
 computer.
 It
 will
 do
 the
 same


thing
 on
 on
 yours.
 And
 on
 my
 computer,
 I


can
 run
 many
 different
 programs
 and


it'll
 do
 the
 same
 thing
 every
 time,


right?
 If
 it's
 working
 properly.
 And


even
 a
 single
 neuron
 is
 a
 very


complicated
 biological
 machine
 that
 is


trying
 to
 keep
 itself
 going,
 you
 know,


right
 down
 into
 the
 furnaces
 of
 of


metabolism.


And
 when
 you
 see
 brains
 like
 that
 and


understand
 their
 their
 richness
 and
 see


how
 different
 they
 are
 from
 from


computers,


then
 it
 really
 undermines
 the
 the
 idea


that
 what
 they're
 doing
 is
 computation


because
 computation
 makes
 sense
 when


you've
 got
 this
 sharp
 separation.
 And
 to


the
 extent
 you
 don't
 have
 that,
 then
 it


makes
 much
 less
 sense
 to
 think
 of
 the


brain
 as
 a
 computer.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 that
 the
 the
 two
 things


that
 it
 makes
 me
 immediately
 think
 of


are
 one
 the
 connection
 between
 our
 our


body
 and
 our
 brain
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 like


you
 know
 if
 you
 exercise
 if
 you
 lift


heavy
 weights
 or
 go
 for
 a
 run
 it
 changes


how
 you
 feel
 in
 your
 brain.
 It
 doesn't


just
 change
 your
 body
 in
 a
 way
 that
 I


think
 if
 I
 get
 a
 new
 mouse
 I
 don't


perceive
 that
 as
 changing
 how
 my


computer
 feels.
 Right.
 you're
 right
 that


um
 there
 is
 this
 tight
 interaction


between
 our
 bodies,
 our
 brains
 and
 our


minds.
 I
 mean
 our
 brains
 are
 part
 of
 our


bodies.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 also
 something


we
 we
 often
 neglect
 but
 but
 the
 brain
 is


is
 an
 organ
 just
 as
 much
 as
 our
 heart,


our
 liver,
 our
 kidneys
 are
 organs.
 Uh


but
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 distinctive
 one.
 It's


probably
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 an


organ
 transplant,
 the
 brain
 is
 the
 one


operation
 for
 which
 you'd
 want
 to
 be
 the


donor
 and
 not
 the
 recipient.
 You
 ask
 a


question
 in
 your
 book
 and
 I
 think
 is
 a


really
 important
 question
 for
 anyone
 who


is
 listening
 to
 this
 or
 watching
 this
 to


ask
 themselves
 as
 well.
 What
 is
 the


aspect
 of
 being
 you
 that
 you
 cling
 to


most
 tightly?


>> I
 think
 the
 aspect
 of
 self
 that
 um
 that


I
 cling
 to
 most
 tightly
 is
 this
 sense
 of


free
 will.
 I
 mean
 one
 of
 the
 other
 I


think
 ways
 in
 which
 our
 intuition
 can


mislead
 us
 when
 we
 think
 about


consciousness
 is
 the
 idea
 that
 the
 self


is
 just
 one
 thing
 that
 there
 is
 a
 single


essence
 of
 Chrisy
 there
 isn't
 a
 single


essence
 of
 of
 an
 Seth
 um
 but
 that's
 not


the
 case
 and
 there
 are
 many
 ways
 in


neurology
 psychiatry
 but
 also
 in
 the
 lab


where
 we
 can
 show
 that
 the
 experience
 of


being
 a
 self
 has
 all
 these
 different


aspects
 which
 are
 all
 present
 in
 a
 kind


of
 unified
 way
 for
 most
 of
 us
 most
 of


the
 time
 but
 which
 can
 come
 apart.
 So


for
 instance,
 emotion
 we
 already
 talked


about
 is
 one
 part
 of
 the
 experience
 of


self.
 It
 feels
 like
 those
 are
 on
 the


verge
 of
 crossing
 from
 the
 interesting


academic
 questions
 into
 a
 really


practical
 applicable
 question
 in
 a
 way


that
 is
 quite
 frankly
 to
 me
 scary.
 I
 so


I'll
 give
 you
 just
 my
 example
 that
 that


I'm
 curious
 what
 you
 think
 about
 is
 for


me
 the
 aspect
 of
 being
 me
 that
 I
 cling


to
 most
 tightly
 is
 I
 think
 some
 version


of
 uniqueness
 that
 like
 I
 am
 me
 and


there
 isn't
 another
 me
 out
 there
 and
 yet


if
 it
 was
 possible
 to
 upload
 my


consciousness
 or
 to
 have
 an
 artificial


intelligence
 that
 was
 trained
 on
 my


voice
 and
 my
 writing
 and
 my
 thinking
 so


much
 so
 that
 it
 was
 the
 same
 as
 me
 but


not
 me
 that
 feels
 quite
 disturbing
 to
 me


and


uh
 and
 yet
 it
 doesn't
 feel
 impossible
 to


imagine
 a
 world
 where
 we
 get
 to
 that


place.
 So So
 I'm
 curious
 to
 to
 hear
 your


take
 on
 that.
 I
 think
 you're
 absolutely


right
 that
 this
 is
 these
 are
 the
 times


we
 live
 in
 and
 that's
 both
 scary
 but


also
 quite
 exciting
 and
 certainly
 very


interesting
 place
 to
 be.
 you
 know,
 as
 as


someone
 who's
 followed
 these
 things,
 of


course,
 both
 in
 popular
 culture,
 as
 we


all
 do,
 but
 just
 watching
 what's


happening,
 the
 underlying
 science
 too.


Um,
 and
 it's
 happening
 in
 many
 ways.
 So,


there's
 the
 example
 you
 give
 about
 these


these
 uh
 avatars
 is
 really
 is
 really


fascinating.
 And
 I've
 had
 couple
 of


opportunities
 to
 have
 a
 digital
 avatar.


I
 haven't
 yet
 taken
 them
 up
 because
 I'm


slightly
 worried
 about,
 you
 know,
 there


are
 very
 ethical
 things
 about
 that
 that


I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 concerned
 about.
 But
 the


fact
 is
 it's
 it's
 now
 possible.
 I
 think


it
 would
 be
 still
 distinguishable
 from


me,
 but
 it's
 that's
 getting,
 you
 know,


that
 things
 will
 just
 get
 better
 and
 and


and
 better
 for
 sure.
 Um,
 the
 other


example
 where
 I
 think
 we're
 on
 the
 cusp


of
 something
 that's
 going
 to
 be


ethically
 and
 morally
 very
 challenging


is
 with
 brain
 computer
 interfaces
 and


you
 can
 stimulate
 the
 brain
 too.
 And


here's
 a
 situation
 where
 on
 the
 one
 hand


you've
 got
 all
 these
 amazing
 clinical


benefits
 that
 you
 just
 can't
 argue


against
 and
 you
 really
 shouldn't
 argue


against
 because
 they're
 they're


brilliant.
 You
 can
 help
 people
 with


Parkinson
 disease.
 You
 can
 restore


paralysis
 uh
 to
 people.
 You
 can
 restore


sight
 to
 blind
 people
 potentially.
 I


mean
 that
 that's
 coming.
 All
 these
 these


amazing
 interventions
 that
 are
 on
 the


horizon
 or
 even
 here
 now
 in
 some
 cases.


But
 then
 you
 get
 to
 this
 um
 other


terrain
 of
 cognitive
 enhancements.
 you


know,
 can
 someone
 who's
 not
 got


paralysis
 or
 blindness
 or
 Parkinson


disease
 um
 should
 we
 all
 have
 brain


computer
 interfaces
 just
 as
 we
 all
 have


cell
 phones
 these
 days?
 Well,
 that's
 a


very
 very
 different
 um
 world
 and
 it's
 a


world
 where
 you
 if
 you
 take
 it
 to
 the
 to


an
 extreme


something
 like
 free
 will
 which
 you
 know


is
 at least
 for
 me
 pretty
 central
 and


part
 of
 uniqueness
 too.
 You
 know
 I
 feel


that
 the
 thoughts
 are
 my
 thoughts.
 I


feel
 that
 that
 my
 actions
 are
 my


actions.
 But
 if
 now
 there's
 a
 a
 a
 brain


computer
 interface
 that
 is
 not
 merely


reading
 out
 my
 intentions
 to
 get


something
 done,
 but
 actually
 causing
 me


to
 have
 intentions
 and
 thoughts
 that
 I


feel
 are
 my
 own,
 but
 I
 would
 not
 have


otherwise
 thought,
 that's
 pretty
 scary


to
 me
 because
 once
 you've
 got
 into
 the


brain,
 there's
 nowhere
 else
 to
 go.
 What


should
 we
 be
 doing
 as
 regular
 people
 to


protect
 our
 consciousness
 or
 to
 think


about
 it
 in
 a
 way
 where
 we
 won't
 just


wake
 up
 in
 a
 world
 that's
 not
 the
 world


we
 want
 to
 live
 in?
 What
 what
 can
 we
 do


or
 how
 can
 we
 uh
 understand
 this
 in
 a


different
 level?


>> Yeah,
 I
 it's
 it's
 a
 very
 difficult


question
 to
 to
 answer.
 I
 think
 the
 good


side
 of
 the
 optimistic
 view
 is
 that


there's
 still
 time
 to
 shape
 the
 future


in
 these
 things.
 We're
 not
 already
 at


the
 stage
 of
 fixing
 problems


um
 that
 have
 already
 come
 to
 exist
 as
 we


are
 for
 instance
 and
 how
 how
 do
 we
 rein


in
 the
 society
 problematic
 consequences


of
 of
 social
 media.
 We
 can
 still
 decide


what
 kinds
 of
 technologies
 we
 want
 and


what
 kinds
 of
 technology
 we
 don't
 want


and
 how
 they
 should
 be
 regulated
 and
 and


or
 made
 available.
 But,
 you
 know,
 I


think
 there
 are
 things
 that,
 you
 know,


regular
 folk
 can
 do.
 You
 know,
 we
 we
 can


all
 do
 and
 it
 it's
 sort
 of
 it
 may
 sound


slightly
 cliched
 or
 try
 to
 say
 it,
 but


but
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 is
 to
 just


not
 be
 scared
 of
 of
 trying
 to
 understand


what's
 going
 on,
 right?
 We
 have
 to
 be


informed.
 if
 we're
 not
 informed
 about


what
 these
 technologies
 do
 um
 and
 also


how
 our
 own
 brains
 work
 too.
 You
 know,


we
 don't
 have
 to
 understand
 every


detail.
 I'm
 not
 asking
 people
 to
 go
 and


do
 whole
 neuroscience
 degrees
 and
 so
 on,


but
 the
 more
 we
 understand
 um
 how
 our


own
 minds
 work,
 I
 think
 the
 better
 we'll


be
 able
 to
 make
 informed
 decisions
 about


the
 kinds
 of
 technologies
 um
 that
 we


want
 to
 people
 who
 are
 caring
 for
 family


members
 and
 loved
 ones
 who
 have


cognitive
 decline
 and
 dementia
 where


this
 question
 of
 is
 this
 my
 mother?
 Is


this
 my
 father?
 Is
 this
 the
 person
 that


I've
 known?
 Is
 not
 a
 hypothetical


question
 and
 it's
 not
 a
 a
 far-off


technological
 question,
 but
 it's
 kind
 of


a
 practical
 day-to-day
 question
 of
 like


who
 is
 this
 person
 that
 I
 love
 and
 that


I
 care
 for?
 And
 are
 they
 the
 same
 person


they
 have
 been?
 And
 because
 you've
 been


in
 that
 situation.


>> So,
 the
 the
 episode
 I
 described
 in
 in


the
 book,
 my
 mother
 was
 in
 a
 hospital


for
 um
 operation.
 She
 was
 um
 just
 shy
 of


80
 years
 old.
 Uh
 but
 there
 were
 problems


in
 the
 hospital
 and
 she
 had
 what
 I
 later


learned
 was
 what
 her
 doctors
 call


hospital
 induced
 delirium
 which
 I'd


never
 heard
 of
 before
 and
 it's


apparently
 very
 common
 especially
 in


older
 people
 and
 the
 name
 is
 immediately


suggestive
 of
 people
 actually
 don't
 know


what
 what's
 going
 on
 at
 all.
 It's
 sort


of a
 name
 straight
 out
 of
 the
 18th


century
 it
 sounded
 like
 to
 me
 but
 it's
 a


severe
 disorientation
 but
 also
 a
 change


of
 personality.
 She
 didn't
 recognize
 me.


she
 thought
 I
 was
 somebody
 else
 and


appeared
 to
 be
 a
 very
 different
 person.


That
 resolved
 but
 but
 yes
 in
 the
 in
 the


years
 since
 then
 it's
 it's
 been
 a


continual
 process
 um
 in
 which
 you
 know


she
 and
 I
 have
 had
 to
 adapt
 to
 very


different
 circumstances.
 So
 there
 are


many
 ways
 in
 which
 a
 person
 can
 continue


to
 be
 the
 same
 person
 even
 if
 they
 no


longer
 know
 much
 about
 who
 they
 are
 or


where
 they
 are,
 who
 other
 people
 are.


And


for
 me
 that's
 been,
 you
 know,
 I
 think


that's
 been
 a
 useful
 strategy.
 It
 it it


helps
 me
 recognize
 that,
 you
 know,


there's
 a
 there's
 a
 deep
 continuity,
 you


know,
 underlying


these
 these
 fairly
 dramatic
 changes,
 but


there's
 there's
 nonetheless
 a


continuity.
 And
 of
 course,
 the
 same
 is


true
 for
 us.
 You
 know,
 we're
 we're


changing
 too,
 but
 we
 just
 don't


experience
 the
 change
 in
 ourselves
 um


because
 we,
 you
 know,
 to
 cut
 the
 long


story
 there,
 very
 short,
 when
 things


change
 very
 slowly,
 we
 tend
 not
 to


perceive
 them
 as
 changing.
 I
 find
 that


to
 be
 so


profound
 and
 so
 comforting.
 It's


impossible
 to
 lose
 it
 because
 it
 is
 a


continuous
 transformation
 through
 the


years.


>> That's
 right.
 It
 was
 never
 there
 in
 the


first
 place
 to
 to
 be
 lost,
 right?
 It's


always
 been
 this
 this
 process.
 And
 um
 I


think
 it's
 it's
 important
 just
 talking


about
 these
 things
 to
 just
 to
 point
 out


that


>> these
 these
 ideas
 have
 of
 course
 been


central
 to
 many
 spiritual
 traditions.


you
 know
 in
 in
 Buddhism
 um
 in
 a
 lot
 of


meditative
 practice
 in
 in
 in
 Hinduism
 as


well
 to
 some
 extent
 the
 idea
 of
 the
 self


as
 process
 as
 identity
 as
 sort
 of


multifaceted
 as
 constructed
 I
 mean
 this


is
 not
 news
 to
 many
 people
 from


different
 cultures
 and
 what
 I
 find
 quite


fascinating
 is
 is
 the
 the
 confluence
 the


convergence


between
 these
 different
 ways
 of
 thinking


and
 it's
 not
 that
 it's
 not
 that
 just


science
 is
 basically
 telling
 the
 same


story
 but
 2,000
 years
 later
 it's
 telling


a
 different
 story
 that
 that
 it's
 a
 story


in
 which
 what
 we
 are
 learning
 from
 the


neuroscience
 and
 the
 philosophy
 modern


philosophy
 about
 the
 self
 I
 think


enriches
 the
 stories
 that
 were
 already


there
 but
 also
 vice
 versa
 I
 think


understanding
 consciousness
 that's
 part


of
 the
 battle
 we
 come
 with
 all
 these


preconceptions
 about
 what
 it
 is
 that


we're
 trying
 to
 understand
 but
 actually


the
 experience
 of
 being
 a
 self
 is
 not


simple
 And
 when
 we
 widen
 the
 lens
 to


other
 cultures
 and
 other
 traditions,
 I


think
 we
 get
 a
 richer
 view
 of
 what


consciousness
 research
 should
 be
 about.


I
 feel
 like
 it
 would
 be
 professional


malpractice
 to
 have
 had
 a
 conversation


about
 consciousness
 and
 the
 self
 and
 to


not
 ask
 you
 about
 drugs,
 hallucinogenic


drugs
 and
 also
 legal
 uh
 anesthetic


drugs,
 right?
 Like


how
 does
 the
 fact
 that
 I
 can
 be
 put


under
 to
 undergo
 an
 operation
 and
 wake


up
 and
 have
 no
 memory
 or
 any
 possible


way
 of
 accessing
 that
 time,
 how
 does


that
 affect
 your
 ideas
 about


consciousness?
 And
 then
 relatedly,
 if
 I


can
 take
 LSD
 or
 hallucinogenic
 mushrooms


or
 any
 of
 these
 other
 types
 of


substances
 and
 change
 my
 experience
 of


the
 world,
 how
 does
 that
 affect


consciousness?
 The
 more
 hallucenic
 drugs


in
 particular
 psychedelic
 drugs
 for
 me


anyway
 emphasizes
 the
 intimate


connection
 between
 consciousness
 and
 the


brain.
 You
 take
 a
 different
 chemical
 now


interfere
 in
 the
 brain's
 business
 with
 a


different
 kind
 of
 electrochemical


manipulation
 pharmacological


manipulation
 and
 now
 instead
 of
 losing


consciousness
 it
 changes
 and
 it
 changes


extremely
 dramatically.


So
 I
 you
 know
 I
 find
 this
 very
 very


good
 uh
 evidence
 is
 highly
 compatible


with
 a
 sort
 of
 view
 that
 consciousness


is
 something
 the
 brain
 does.
 You
 know


you
 intervene
 in
 the
 brain
 and


consciousness
 changes.
 Interestingly
 you


know
 you
 can
 take
 it
 in
 a
 very
 different


way.
 You
 could
 take
 the
 experiences
 that


you
 have
 on
 psychedelics
 as
 some
 sort
 of


insight
 into
 the
 nature
 of
 reality
 and


come
 to
 a
 very
 different
 conclusion
 that


oh
 look
 you
 know
 I've
 experienced
 um


that
 consciousness
 is
 in
 fact
 a


fundamental
 property
 of
 the
 universe
 and


so
 it
 doesn't
 depend
 on
 the
 brain
 at


all.
 It
 all
 depends
 on
 your
 prior
 what


you
 come
 into
 it
 with.
 For
 me
 it
 sort
 of


reinforces
 the
 dependence
 of


consciousness
 on
 the
 brain.
 But
 I
 think


in
 each
 case


um
 psychedelics


can
 show
 well
 for
 well
 maybe
 not
 in
 each


case
 but
 certainly
 from


the
 perspective
 that
 psychedelics
 change


the
 brain
 and
 that
 changes


consciousness.


It's
 a
 it
 really
 underlines
 that
 what
 we


experience
 is
 is
 a
 construction


because
 you
 change
 aspects
 of
 brain


function
 aspects
 of
 our
 conscious


experience
 that
 we
 might
 otherwise
 take


for
 granted.
 You
 know,
 we
 we
 can
 realize


are
 things
 that
 the
 brain
 is
 doing
 um


because
 they're
 changed
 or or
 they
 go


away.
 So
 for
 me
 it's
 a
 very
 in
 it


provides
 a
 lot
 of
 insight
 into
 those


aspects
 of
 of
 consciousness
 which
 need


explaining
 and
 that's
 entirely
 separate


from
 all
 the
 the
 potential
 therapeutic


benefits
 which
 I
 which
 I
 think
 are
 also


very
 exciting
 very
 interesting.
 I
 think


the
 jury's
 is
 going
 to
 be
 out
 for
 a


little
 while
 on
 their
 on
 their
 overall


efficacy.
 Um
 but
 there's
 there's
 a


certainly
 a
 lot
 of
 rich
 potential
 there.


>> A
 perfect
 place
 to
 end.
 Thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 being
 on
 the
 show.
 Thank
 you


for
 your
 work
 and
 and
 thank
 you
 for


taking
 the
 time
 to
 explain
 it
 to
 us.


>> No,
 thanks
 Chris.
 It's
 been
 a
 real


pleasure.
 Thanks
 a
 lot
 for
 having
 me
 on


the
 show.
