My
 first
 piece
 of
 advice
 to
 most
 people


would
 be
 don't
 start
 a
 company.
 The


reason
 I
 say
 that,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of


people
 told
 me
 that
 starting
 a
 company


is
 really
 hard.
 Everyone
 told
 me
 this.
 I


do
 not
 believe
 them.
 Everyone
 says
 this


to
 every
 potential
 founder.
 I
 have
 now


said
 this
 to
 many
 condo
 and
 I
 could
 see


it
 in
 the
 eyes
 that
 they
 do
 not
 believe


me
 that
 they
 think,
 "Oh,
 how
 hard
 could


it
 be?"
 I
 do
 believe
 it
 genuinely
 is


very,
 very
 hard.
 I
 think
 the
 most


important
 advice
 I
 would
 give
 any


founder
 is
 the
 level
 of
 conviction
 they


should
 have
 on
 deciding
 this
 is
 the


problem
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 work
 on


should
 be
 extremely
 high.
 It
 should
 be
 a


higher
 degree
 of
 conviction
 than
 almost


anything
 else
 they
 have
 ever
 done
 in


their
 life
 to
 that
 date.
 I've
 had
 kidney


stones
 in
 my
 life
 which
 are
 very
 painful


and
 very
 hard.
 A
 startup
 is
 a
 whole
 new


type
 of
 hard.
 It's
 hard
 over
 a
 very
 long


area
 under
 the
 curve.
 Look,
 if
 you
 just


want
 to
 make
 money,
 there's
 a
 lot
 better


ways
 to
 go
 make
 money.
 You
 should
 only


start
 a
 company
 when
 you
 have
 such
 a


high
 degree
 of
 conviction
 that
 this
 is


the
 most
 important
 problem
 you
 should


solve
 in
 the
 world
 that
 you
 are
 willing


to
 go
 for
 decades
 without
 getting
 paid,


without
 being
 recognized,
 and


potentially
 being
 rejected
 by
 everyone


all
 around
 you
 to
 go
 work
 on
 this


problem
 and
 nothing
 but
 this
 problem
 for


decades
 at
 a
 time.


I'm
 Sadi
 Khan.
 I'm
 the
 co-founder
 and


CEO
 of
 AAN.
 We
 announced
 our
 series
 E


fundraising
 where
 we
 raised
 a
 little
 bit


over
 $110
 million
 at
 a
 $2.2
 billion


valuation.
 This
 is
 doubling
 our


valuation
 from
 last
 year.
 Aan's
 mission


is
 to
 reduce
 the
 cost
 of
 capital
 for


consumers.
 Today,
 there's
 $1
 trillion
 of


credit
 card
 debt
 in
 the
 United
 States.


Consumers
 today
 are
 paying
 almost
 $200


billion
 a
 year
 on
 just
 interest


payments.
 Not
 the
 principle,
 just
 the


interest
 payments
 on
 it.
 If
 we
 can


reduce
 that
 by
 50%.
 Then
 we
 will
 have


saved
 US
 consumers
 a
 hundred
 billion


dollars
 every
 single
 year.
 Our
 thesis
 is


very
 simple.
 We
 think
 that
 unsecured


debt
 in
 the
 United
 States
 is
 very
 very


expensive
 but
 transactionally
 very


efficient
 to
 get
 access
 to.
 On
 the
 other


hand,
 we
 think
 that
 secured
 debt,
 debt


backed
 by
 assets
 you
 already
 own
 is
 much


much
 cheaper
 for
 consumers
 but
 is


transactionally
 quite
 inefficient.
 Take


for
 example
 home
 equity.
 It's
 the


largest
 asset
 class
 that
 US
 consumers


own
 today.
 However,
 it
 takes
 weeks
 to


get
 access
 to
 your
 home
 equity.
 And
 it


costs
 thousands
 of
 dollars
 in


origination
 fees,
 both
 for
 you
 and


actually
 for
 the
 lender.
 Aan
 set
 out
 to


solve
 this
 problem.
 We
 built
 our


flagship
 product,
 the
 AAN
 home
 equity


back
 credit
 card.
 Home
 equity
 line
 of


credit
 in
 the
 back
 and
 a
 credit
 card
 in


the
 front
 with
 a
 goal
 that
 in
 as
 fast
 as


15
 minutes,
 we
 want
 to
 reduce
 your


interest
 rate
 by
 50%.
 A
 isn't
 stopping


there.
 We're
 excited
 to
 continuously


invest
 in
 building
 new
 and
 better


products
 that
 are
 the
 lowest
 cost,
 most


convenient,
 and
 most
 transparent
 access


to
 capital
 for
 homeowners
 across


America.


About
 7
 years
 ago,
 I
 retired
 from


Facebook
 and
 stepped
 down
 and
 I
 was


taking
 some
 time
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 I


want
 to
 do
 next.
 Retirement
 was
 very


challenging
 for
 me.
 I've
 been
 an


engineer
 and
 a
 product
 manager
 my
 whole


life.
 I
 felt
 that
 I
 didn't
 have
 much


value
 I
 was
 creating
 in
 society
 in
 my


retirement
 time.
 It
 didn't
 last
 very


long.
 You
 know,
 my
 wife
 would
 claim
 that


I
 was
 only
 retired
 for
 3
 months.
 I
 would


claim
 I
 was
 retired
 for
 6
 months.
 So,


the
 truth
 is
 somewhere
 in
 between
 there.


But
 I
 became
 excited
 about
 this
 core


thesis
 that
 I
 think
 most
 people
 in
 the


world
 when
 they're
 looking
 to
 solve


problems
 will
 end
 up
 solving
 problems


that
 are
 about
 helping
 society
 be


healthier
 or
 be
 wealthier.
 And
 if
 you


want
 to
 help
 society
 be
 wealthier,
 you


either
 want
 to
 help
 people
 make
 more


money
 or
 you
 want
 to
 help
 people
 save


money.
 One
 of
 the
 interesting
 graphs
 I


stumbled
 upon
 at
 this
 time
 was
 this


actually
 this
 publishing
 from
 the
 CFPB


which
 published
 this
 graph
 which
 to
 this


day
 is
 actually
 our
 Northstar
 graph
 and


it's
 a
 graph
 that
 shows
 that
 the
 total


revolving
 balance
 the
 total
 balance
 on


credit
 cards
 since
 inception
 of
 credit


cards
 has
 grown
 to
 up
 to
 a
 trillion


dollars
 over
 the
 last
 3/4
 of
 a
 century.


And
 so
 this
 graph
 kind
 of
 just
 goes
 up


and
 to
 the
 right
 and
 it
 doesn't
 seem


like
 it's
 decreasing
 anytime
 soon.
 But


there's
 another
 very
 fascinating
 line


that
 was
 overlaid
 on
 this
 graph.
 And


this
 line
 shows
 you
 the
 interest
 rate
 on


this
 credit
 card
 revolving
 debt
 over
 the


same
 period
 of
 time.
 So
 over
 half
 a


century,
 the
 interest
 rate
 on
 credit


cards
 have
 actually
 hovered
 between


20-ish
 to
 20-ish
 25%
 for
 this
 entire


period
 of
 time.
 If
 you
 look
 back
 in


history
 over
 this
 time,
 we've
 invented


the
 internet.
 We've
 invented
 all
 of
 the


modern
 tech
 companies
 we
 see
 in
 Silicon


Valley
 from
 Facebook,
 Google,
 Nvidia,


Amazon.
 But
 we
 haven't
 been
 able
 to


reduce
 the
 cost
 of
 interest
 on
 a


trillion
 dollars
 of
 credit
 card
 debt
 in


this
 period
 of
 time.
 Heck,
 at
 this


point,
 we're
 inventing
 entirely
 new


currencies
 from
 Bitcoin
 to
 Ethereum.
 But


the
 cost
 of
 capital
 for
 consumers
 has


really
 not
 changed.
 In
 the
 pursuit
 of


helping
 society
 be
 wealthier
 by
 helping


consumers
 in
 America
 save
 money,
 we


thought
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 ridiculous.
 And


we
 thought
 we
 can
 build
 better
 products


for
 consumers
 to
 help
 them
 save
 money.


And
 that's
 how
 we
 started
 AAN
 which
 is


taking
 the
 largest
 asset
 class
 that
 US


consumers
 own
 which
 is
 home
 equity
 which


is
 also
 the
 most
 inconvenient
 to
 access.


It
 costs
 thousands
 of
 dollars
 to
 access


home
 equity
 and
 today
 it
 takes
 about
 3


to
 4
 weeks
 to
 get
 access
 to
 your
 home


equity.
 And
 we
 decided
 to
 make
 that
 much


much
 more
 efficient
 by
 machining
 this


process
 for
 maximum
 efficiency.
 We
 were


able
 to
 bring
 this
 down
 to
 be
 almost
 as


fast
 as
 15
 minutes
 with
 transactional


costs
 that
 are
 orders
 of
 magnitude
 lower


than
 anything
 else
 in
 the
 market
 and
 put


it
 in
 a
 form
 factor
 that
 consumers
 are


comfortable
 and
 already
 are
 familiar


with
 which
 is
 a
 credit
 card.
 And
 we


launched
 the
 our
 flagship
 product,
 the


AAN
 home
 equity
 card.


[Music]


Through
 my
 time
 at
 Microsoft
 and


Facebook,
 probably
 the
 single
 most


important
 thing
 I
 learned
 is
 the
 value


of
 an
 extremely
 elite
 technical
 team.


The
 differential
 between
 the
 99th


percentile
 or
 the
 99th.9th
 percentile


engineer
 and
 the
 95th
 percentile


engineer
 is
 fast,
 is
 not
 small,
 is
 a


huge
 amount.
 The
 amount
 of
 resources
 you


should
 spend
 on
 the
 acquisition
 and


retention
 of
 the
 absolute
 best
 technical


talent
 far
 surpasses
 any
 other


investment
 you
 should
 make
 and
 can
 make.


When
 we
 look
 for
 the
 best
 technical


talent
 and
 at
 a
 my
 and
 I
 think
 the


team's
 single
 highest
 priority
 is
 the


collection
 and
 retention
 of
 the
 absolute


best
 technical
 talent
 in
 the
 world.


There
 are
 three
 main
 things
 we
 look
 for


when
 we
 look
 for
 great
 technical
 talent.


The
 first
 is
 raw
 intelligence.
 We
 are


unapologetic
 about
 looking
 for
 the


absolute
 smartest
 people
 we
 can
 find
 in


the
 world.
 We
 will
 ask
 for
 SAT
 scores


and
 other
 forms
 of
 standardized
 tests.


As
 controversial
 as
 that
 may
 be


sometimes
 I
 will
 personally
 review


transcripts
 and
 look
 at
 exactly
 what


grades
 people
 got
 on
 what
 classes.
 For


engineers
 specifically
 we
 look
 for


people
 who've
 taken
 courses
 in
 operating


systems,
 distributed
 systems,
 compilers,


games
 engines,
 the
 hardest
 technical


courses
 one
 can
 take.
 And
 how
 did
 they


do
 on
 them?
 And
 importantly,
 did
 they


attempt
 the
 really
 really
 hardest


closest
 that
 that
 can
 be
 taken?


Intelligence
 is
 massively
 underrated
 and


how
 important
 it
 actually
 is
 in
 helping


build
 products
 and
 companies.
 So
 that
 is


our
 number
 one
 and
 most
 important
 thing


we
 look
 at
 in
 technical
 talent.
 The


second
 is
 work
 ethic.
 You
 can
 have
 all


the
 intelligence
 in
 the
 world,
 but
 if


you
 don't
 want
 to
 apply
 it,
 if
 you
 do


not
 have
 the
 motivation
 and
 the


endurance
 to
 apply
 that
 intelligence,


you're
 not
 going
 to
 create
 much
 output


or
 much
 value
 to
 society.
 And
 so
 we
 look


for
 people
 who
 have
 the
 endurance,
 the


ability
 to
 work
 hard
 consistently
 over


time.
 At
 AEN,
 every
 Sunday
 at
 6
 PM,
 our


entire
 leadership
 team
 meets
 to
 identify


and
 finalize
 and
 lock
 in
 our
 road
 map


for
 the
 next
 7
 days.
 This
 allows
 us
 to


operate
 with
 high
 precision
 and
 high


velocity.
 And
 it
 gives
 us
 a
 very


important
 thing
 which
 is
 we
 should
 not


be
 wrong
 in
 our
 road
 map
 for
 more
 than
 7


days
 cuz
 we
 revisit
 our
 road
 map
 every
 7


days
 to
 make
 sure
 we're
 working
 on
 the


right
 set
 of
 things
 and
 the
 right


priority
 order
 with
 the
 right
 set
 of


people.
 The
 third
 thing
 that's
 really


important
 in
 elite
 talent
 is
 an


alignment
 of
 the
 mission
 of
 the


enterprise.
 In
 our
 case,
 the
 mission
 of


reducing
 the
 cost
 of
 capital
 for


consumers
 with
 the
 ambition
 level
 of


that
 person.
 Trying
 to
 reduce
 the
 cost


of
 capital
 for
 all
 of
 America
 is
 an


extremely
 ambitious
 undertaking.
 So
 the


person
 that
 we
 need
 to
 bring
 in
 needs
 to


be
 super
 smart,
 super
 hardworking
 and


has
 to
 have
 an
 alignment
 with
 this


mission
 and
 an
 alignment
 with
 the


ambition
 level
 of
 this
 mission
 so
 they


can
 sustainably
 work
 on
 this
 for
 a
 very


long
 time
 and
 push
 the
 boundaries
 of
 how


we
 would
 achieve
 this
 mission
 day
 in
 and


day
 out.
 If
 a
 to
 be
 successful,
 we
 will


drive
 the
 single
 biggest
 change
 in
 the


cost
 of
 capital
 in
 American
 history.
 And


we
 need
 to
 find
 the
 absolute
 best
 talent


in
 the
 world
 so
 we
 can
 do
 that.
 And
 if


we
 can't
 find
 the
 absolute
 best


technical
 talent,
 we
 will
 not
 be


successful.
 And
 that
 is
 why
 we
 spend
 so


much
 of
 our
 time
 and
 so
 much
 of
 our


energy
 on
 this
 specific
 problem.
 And


it's
 probably
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 I


ever
 learned
 at
 Microsoft
 and
 at


Facebook.


Aan's
 flagship
 product,
 the
 first


product
 that
 we
 wanted
 to
 build
 was
 a


home
 equitybacked
 credit
 card.
 The


reason
 it
 was
 very
 important
 for
 us
 to


understand
 the
 legal
 and
 regulatory


landscape
 for
 this
 product
 is
 because


this
 is
 a
 very
 highly
 regulated


industry.
 It
 is
 both
 a
 mortgage
 product


and
 a
 credit
 card
 product.
 And
 it's
 very


important
 for
 myself
 as
 the
 founder
 to


have
 a
 deep
 understanding
 of
 the


regulatory
 landscape
 for
 this
 product
 to


a
 understand
 can
 we
 build
 it
 and
 b
 to


make
 sure
 we
 build
 it
 in
 a
 safe
 and


compliant
 way.
 That's
 why
 I
 went
 through


and
 read
 personally
 a
 lot
 of
 the


regulations
 in
 the
 space
 whether
 it
 be


DoddFrank
 Act,
 Card
 Act,
 Tila
 and


others.
 I
 think
 it
 is
 very
 very


important
 for
 the
 founders
 and
 the
 CEOs


to
 be
 very
 deeply
 involved
 in
 the


details
 of
 the
 products
 that
 are
 being


built
 by
 the
 company.
 I
 think
 in
 the


case
 of
 founding
 a
 new
 company
 or


building
 a
 new
 product
 even
 at
 a
 big


company
 often
 times
 the
 core
 value
 is


the
 inventing
 of
 something
 new
 something


that
 hasn't
 existed
 before
 or
 something


that
 hasn't
 been
 built
 yet
 before
 in


order
 to
 build
 something
 new
 I
 think
 you


must
 first
 understand
 the
 history
 of


what
 has
 been
 tried
 before
 so
 that
 you


can
 efficiently
 build
 something
 new
 most


new
 ideas
 are
 terrible
 most
 new
 ideas


are
 bad
 there
 are
 very
 very
 few
 new


ideas
 that
 are
 actually
 better
 than
 all


the
 old
 ideas
 before.
 And
 so
 in
 order
 to


assess
 that,
 in
 order
 to
 deeply
 grock


whether
 or
 not
 your
 idea
 is
 better,
 it


is
 often
 very
 useful
 to
 understand
 what


were
 the
 ideas
 at least
 the
 big
 ones


that
 have
 been
 explored
 and
 built


before.
 Why
 is
 your
 new
 idea
 better
 than


what
 has
 already
 been
 built
 before?
 And


in
 order
 to
 do
 that,
 you
 must
 often


invest
 the
 time
 to
 understand
 and
 learn


very
 deeply
 about
 this
 industry
 and
 this


domain
 and
 all
 the
 smart
 people
 that


have
 come
 before
 you
 so
 that
 you
 can


come
 up
 with
 good
 new
 ideas
 and
 assess


that
 they
 are
 indeed
 better
 than
 what


has
 been
 built
 before.


In
 the
 first
 two
 or
 three
 years
 of


building
 a
 we
 made
 a
 series
 of
 product


decisions
 and
 a
 series
 of
 people


decisions
 and
 a
 series
 of
 process


decisions.
 I
 think
 in
 the
 product
 we


would
 have
 been
 even
 more
 ruthless
 in


prioritizing
 the
 feature
 set
 that
 we


were
 building
 for
 in
 the
 first
 version


and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 you
 know
 generally


true
 for
 for
 most
 PMs
 when
 they
 launch
 a


new
 product
 they
 if
 you
 were
 to
 look


back
 and
 ask
 any
 product
 manager
 what


products
 they've
 launched
 before
 and


what
 they
 would
 do
 differently
 almost


all
 of
 them
 would
 tell
 you
 I
 would
 have


cut
 these
 you
 know
 five
 out
 of
 the
 10


features
 and
 shipped
 a
 smaller
 narrower


version
 of
 this
 product
 to
 a
 fewer
 set


of
 people
 and
 really
 deeply
 gone
 into
 a


kind
 of
 a
 more
 focused
 product
 feature


set
 and
 so
 I
 think
 that
 also
 applies
 to


a
 and
 I
 think
 it
 applies
 to
 the
 product


that
 we
 built.
 I
 would
 have
 kind
 of
 made


it
 narrower
 and
 simpler
 in
 the
 first


version.
 The
 other
 big
 thing
 is
 in
 the


early
 days
 there
 were
 these
 really
 funny


stories
 of
 consumers
 going
 through
 our


origination
 process
 but
 not
 sure
 that


this
 was
 real.
 And
 we
 would
 get
 tickets


and
 calls
 to
 say
 we
 don't
 know
 if
 you


guys
 are
 a
 scam
 or
 not.
 And
 we
 would


have
 to
 respond
 including
 sometimes


myself
 saying
 no
 we're
 we're
 very
 real.


We're
 a
 real
 company
 and
 we're
 here
 to


help
 you
 get
 access
 to
 your
 home
 equity


and
 we
 have
 a
 real
 product
 that
 you
 can


use.
 And
 sometimes
 it
 was
 that
 ability


to
 talk
 to
 somebody
 at
 the
 company
 and


the
 abble
 to
 hear
 from
 somebody's
 voice


at
 the
 company
 that
 gave
 them
 the


confidence
 to
 continue
 uh
 and
 go
 through


our
 application
 process.
 Um
 I
 do
 think


one
 of
 the
 interesting
 things
 that


happened
 with
 with
 AAN
 is
 that
 we
 were


able
 to
 find
 people
 who
 were
 kind
 of
 on


the
 on
 the
 on
 the
 border
 of
 potentially


considering
 a
 home
 equity
 line
 of


credit.
 And
 many
 folks
 were
 actually


sometimes
 in
 the
 process
 of
 applying
 for


a
 home
 equity
 line
 of
 credit
 to
 to
 other


other
 lenders
 and
 then
 they
 would
 see
 an


ad
 from
 us
 and
 go,
 I
 wonder
 if
 this
 is


true.
 Can
 I
 get
 a
 home
 equity
 line
 of


credit
 in
 as
 fast
 as
 15
 minutes?
 And


they
 would
 almost
 test
 us
 out
 as
 like
 a


almost
 like
 an
 experiment
 to
 see
 if
 this


is
 like
 real.
 And
 when
 they
 went
 through


the
 process,
 they
 would
 be
 kind
 of


amazed
 and
 shocked.
 and
 then
 they
 would


actually
 book
 an
 account
 with
 us
 instead


of
 whoever
 they
 had
 started
 off
 a
 home


equity
 line
 of
 credit
 application
 with


before
 us.
 And
 so
 that
 was
 I
 think
 an


interesting
 kind
 of
 lesson
 learned.
 And


you
 know
 many
 people
 in
 the
 beginning


didn't
 believe
 that
 this
 was
 possible
 to


do.


My
 ideal
 form
 of
 leadership
 is
 one
 that


maximally
 rational.
 I
 observed
 and
 and


learned
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 from
 Mark
 at


Facebook.
 The
 reason
 this
 is
 important


is
 because
 being
 extremely
 rational
 is
 a


very
 predictive
 behavior
 and
 being


predictable
 as
 a
 leader
 is
 very
 very


important
 because
 people
 can
 then


replicate
 or
 predict
 what
 you
 would
 do


even
 when
 you're
 not
 there.
 And
 that
 is


important
 for
 people
 to
 be
 able
 to


reproduce
 your
 decision-m
 system
 even


when
 you're
 not
 present.
 And
 my
 goal
 as


a
 leader
 is
 to
 make
 decisions
 that
 are


so
 rational
 that
 if
 everyone
 else
 also


had
 the
 same
 information
 that
 I
 had,


they
 too
 would
 all
 make
 actually
 the


same
 decision.
 And
 the
 two
 incremental


things
 that
 I
 provide
 as
 a
 leader
 that


let's
 say
 an
 individual
 contributor
 in


the
 company
 don't
 necessarily
 have
 is


that
 I
 have
 significantly
 more
 context


and
 a
 lot
 more
 information
 sometimes


than
 others.
 And
 my
 job
 is
 to
 actually


make
 sure
 as
 many
 people
 have
 that


context
 as
 possible.
 and
 two,
 I
 have
 the


privilege
 of
 being
 able
 to
 optimize
 for


a
 much
 longer
 time
 horizon
 than
 anyone


else
 in
 the
 company.
 So
 these
 two
 things


are
 the
 incremental
 value
 propositions


that
 I
 bring
 to
 a
 decision
 that
 is
 not


always
 possible
 for
 every
 single
 other


individual
 contributor
 to
 always
 bring.


But
 if
 they
 were
 to
 actually
 have
 those


two
 things
 in
 their
 mind,
 they
 should
 be


able
 to
 compute
 to
 the
 same
 conclusion


that
 I
 come
 to.
 And
 that
 is
 my
 goal
 as
 a


leader.
 If
 I
 were
 to
 just
 make
 decisions


because
 I
 emotionally
 felt
 like
 this
 was


a
 good
 decision
 or
 not.
 The
 problem
 with


that
 even
 if
 I'm
 occasionally
 right,


they're
 very
 difficult
 to
 scale
 because


if
 I
 I
 can
 tell
 somebody
 that
 decision


that
 I
 felt
 we
 should
 do
 X
 and
 because


of
 my
 authority,
 some
 people
 will
 do
 X.


But
 when
 that
 person
 needs
 to
 explain
 it


to
 two
 more
 people,
 it
 is
 very
 difficult


for
 that
 person
 to
 explain
 it
 to
 two


more
 people
 other
 than
 just
 saying,


well,
 Saddy
 feels
 that
 way.
 instead
 of


explaining
 here's
 the
 logic
 of
 why
 we


made
 this
 decision
 and
 that
 logic
 is
 a


very
 scalable
 form
 of
 decisioning
 that


then
 you
 can
 like
 actually
 send
 to
 a
 lot


more
 people
 to
 execute
 effectively
 and


this
 is
 really
 important
 because
 a
 lot


of
 what
 you
 know
 an
 early
 stage
 start
 or


frankly
 any
 company
 does
 is
 try
 to


perfect
 its
 execution
 and
 the
 only
 way


to
 perfect
 execution
 is
 to
 have
 extreme


clarity
 and
 to
 have
 extreme
 clarity
 in


what
 we
 are
 trying
 to
 do
 you
 must
 often


have
 extreme
 clarity
 on
 why
 we
 are
 doing


it
 in
 the
 first
 place.
 And
 I
 think
 that


clarity
 must
 stem
 all
 the
 way
 from
 the


CEO
 and
 the
 founder
 to
 the
 individual


contributor
 who's
 working
 on
 the


smallest
 and
 the
 minutest
 of
 diffs
 that


need
 to
 go
 out
 the
 door.


I
 think
 it
 stems
 from
 a
 philosophy
 of


trying
 to
 be
 maximally
 rational.
 The


reason
 for
 this
 is
 is
 quite
 simple.
 If


we
 were
 to
 achieve
 our
 mission
 of


reducing
 the
 cost
 of
 capital
 for
 as
 many


consumers
 as
 possible,
 the
 first
 most


imperative
 item
 we
 must
 achieve
 is
 we


must
 first
 not
 die.
 If
 we
 are
 dead,
 then


we
 aren't
 helping
 too
 many
 people
 reduce


that
 cost
 of
 capital.
 In
 order
 to
 not


die,
 we
 must
 make
 sure
 we
 generate


profit
 and
 are
 to
 a
 certain
 extent
 a


good
 business.
 Then
 we
 derive
 well,
 how


many
 people
 can
 we
 save
 how
 much
 money


for?
 And
 that
 becomes
 like
 the
 maximal


optimization
 function
 in
 a
 sustainable


way.
 And
 therefore
 I
 think
 having
 a
 very


disciplined
 approach
 to
 the


profitability
 of
 the
 business
 while
 at


the
 same
 time
 maximizing
 our
 mission
 is


actually
 quite
 rational
 for
 us
 to


pursue.
 The
 most
 important
 goal
 for
 I


think
 everyone
 and
 any
 company
 and
 any


person
 is
 to
 create
 a
 lot
 of
 value
 in


the
 world.
 And
 profitability
 comes
 from


capturing
 some
 amount
 of
 that
 value
 that


you
 create
 for
 the
 company
 and
 doing
 it


efficiently.
 If
 you
 kind
 of
 think
 about


like
 today
 there's
 $1
 trillion
 of
 credit


card
 debt
 in
 the
 United
 States.


Consumers
 today
 are
 paying
 almost
 $200


billion
 a
 year
 on
 just
 interest


payments.
 Not
 the
 principle,
 just
 the


interest
 payments
 on
 it.
 If
 we
 can


reduce
 that
 by
 50%.
 Then
 we
 will
 have


saved
 us
 consumers
 a
 hundred
 billion


every
 single
 year.
 Our
 profit
 should


come
 from
 savings
 that
 we
 bring
 to
 the


consumer
 because
 that's
 the
 value
 we've


created.
 And
 our
 goal
 is
 to
 be


profitable
 by
 saving
 people
 money.
 And
 I


think
 that
 achieves
 our
 mission
 and
 is


very
 rational
 and
 missionaligned
 to
 what


we
 are
 trying
 to
 achieve
 in
 the
 world.


One
 of
 my
 somewhat
 controversial


opinions
 around
 decision-m
 is
 that
 I


really
 hate
 pros
 and
 cons
 lists.
 They're


like
 maybe
 one
 level
 below
 useless.
 I


think
 a
 much
 more
 effective
 framework
 to


make
 a
 decision
 is
 to
 first
 of
 all
 lay


out
 what
 are
 the
 axes
 of
 this
 decision


that
 are
 most
 to
 least
 important
 to
 this


decision
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 make.
 and


then
 to
 list
 out
 each
 of
 the
 options
 and


to
 lay
 out
 where
 this
 option
 kind
 of


sits
 relative
 to
 that
 particular
 axis.


So
 for
 example,
 let's
 say
 you
 need
 to


make
 a
 decision
 on
 what
 car
 you
 want
 to


buy
 and
 you
 know
 the
 axis
 that
 matter


are
 things
 like
 price,
 things
 like


performance
 of
 the
 car,
 let's
 say


reliability
 of
 the
 car
 and
 let's
 say


style
 of
 the
 car.
 much
 more
 effective


than
 trying
 to
 build
 a
 pros
 and
 cons


list
 between
 like
 let's
 say
 a
 Toyota


Camry
 or
 a
 Honda
 Civic
 is
 to
 list
 out


what
 is
 your
 priority
 of
 each
 of
 these


axis.
 Is
 it
 speed/performance?


Is
 it
 style?
 Is
 it
 cost?
 Is
 it


reliability?
 And
 once
 you
 prioritize


this
 set
 of
 axis,
 then
 you
 can
 look
 at


your
 option
 space
 and
 see
 which
 one


fulfills
 the
 highest
 order
 priorities


for
 your
 decision-m.
 I'm
 such
 a
 big


believer
 in
 this.
 We
 actually
 teach
 this


process
 in
 our
 boot
 camp
 at
 AAN.
 I
 tell


people
 in
 boot
 camp
 that
 this
 is
 a


process
 that
 I've
 used
 to
 make
 almost


all
 my
 decisions
 in
 my
 life.
 And
 I
 would


argue
 this
 was
 also
 a
 process
 that
 I


implemented
 when
 I
 was
 looking
 to
 get


married
 very
 early
 on
 in
 my
 life.
 This


is
 a
 very
 important
 framework
 to
 help


people
 make
 decisions
 not
 just
 in
 their


professional
 life
 but
 I
 still
 think
 in


their
 personal
 life.
 And
 I
 think
 the


simple
 focus
 away
 from
 the
 options
 and


more
 into
 the
 prioritized
 list
 of
 axis


that
 matter
 is
 much
 more
 functionally


beneficial
 to
 the
 quality
 of
 a


decision-m.


I
 will
 add
 that
 I
 wear
 the
 same
 clothes


every
 day,
 the
 long
 sleeve
 black


t-shirt,
 the
 blue
 jeans
 and
 and
 the


vest.
 I
 am
 a
 very
 big
 believer
 in


simplifying
 as
 much
 of
 my
 life
 as


possible.
 I
 have
 a
 very
 boring
 personal


life.
 I
 live
 5
 to
 6
 minutes
 away
 from


the
 office.
 I
 moved
 my
 home
 to
 be
 near


the
 office.
 I
 don't
 drink.
 I
 don't


party.
 I
 don't
 really
 go
 out
 that
 much.


I
 enjoy
 spending
 time
 with
 my
 family.
 I


like
 to
 cook
 twice
 a
 week.
 I
 have
 very


kind
 of
 regular
 routine
 with
 my
 family


on
 the
 specific
 nights
 of
 the
 week
 that


I
 cook
 for
 my
 family.
 I
 go
 to
 the
 gym


and
 I
 work
 because
 I
 have
 a
 very


simplistic
 life.
 Another
 thing
 that
 I


for
 example
 like
 to
 optimize
 is
 my


computer
 keyboard,
 mouse
 and
 chair


layout.
 And
 so
 I
 have
 three


workstations,
 one
 at
 the
 office,
 two
 in


home.
 And
 all
 of
 them
 have
 the
 exact


same
 mouse,
 exact
 same
 keyboard,
 and


exact
 same
 monitor
 layout
 so
 that
 I
 can


very
 optimally
 get
 to
 my
 workstation
 and


begin
 working
 instead
 of
 setting
 up
 or


adjusting,
 you
 know,
 my
 keyboard
 or
 my


mouse.
 I
 mean,
 you
 probably
 know
 this


already.
 If
 the
 keyboard
 is
 off
 by
 even


a
 millimeter,
 your
 typing
 error


increases
 massively
 because
 you
 have
 to


adjust.
 One
 of
 the
 reasons
 our
 company


is
 located
 in
 South
 Bay
 and
 not
 in
 like


a
 major
 city
 like
 San
 Francisco
 or
 San


Jose
 is
 that
 we
 want
 to
 provide
 our


employees
 some
 calmness,
 some
 serenity


so
 that
 we
 can
 focus
 on
 the
 mission
 at


hand
 and
 not
 be
 distracted
 by
 the
 hustle


and
 bustle
 of
 of
 around
 us.
 And
 I
 like


to
 have
 like
 frankly
 a
 very
 boring
 life.


You
 know,
 I
 I
 think
 I
 told
 somebody
 this


is
 if
 I
 were
 to
 know
 everything
 that


will
 happen
 to
 me
 between
 today
 and
 my


death.
 I'll
 be
 very
 happy.
 I
 have
 no


need
 for
 surprises
 or
 excitement.
 Um
 I


love
 boring.
 Boring
 is
 great.
 If
 my
 life


could
 be
 just
 boring,
 I'll
 be
 very


happy.
