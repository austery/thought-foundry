[Music]


Hi
 everybody
 and
 welcome
 to
 in
 good


company.
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangan
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 So
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today


I'm
 in
 really
 good
 company
 with
 Robert


Kinsel
 the
 CEO
 of
 Warner
 Music
 Group
 one


of
 the
 world's
 largest
 record
 labels.


Now
 they
 have
 incredible
 artists


including
 my
 favorite
 co-play
 Ed
 Sharon


Dualipa
 and
 even
 the
 Norwegian
 legends.


Aha.
 Very
 good
 Robert.
 What
 a
 pleasure


to
 have
 you
 on.
 Same
 here.
 Thank
 you
 so


much.
 Now
 we
 need
 to
 kind
 of
 kick
 off


with
 uh
 with
 your
 beginning.
 you
 were


born
 in
 uh
 Czecha
 and
 so
 how
 does
 your


background
 shape
 you
 as
 the
 leader
 you


are
 today?
 So
 actually
 you
 know
 when
 I


was
 born
 and
 grew
 up
 it
 was


Czechoslovakia
 the
 country
 rebranded


three
 times
 in
 my
 lifetime.
 Um
 it
 tells


you
 something
 about
 change
 that
 I'm


probably
 used
 to
 but
 uh
 the
 way
 it


shaped
 me
 was
 interesting.
 My
 parents,


my
 mom
 was
 a
 teacher,
 my
 dad
 was
 a


doctor,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 in
 a
 socialist


communist
 society,
 uh,
 not
 earning
 much,


but
 the
 values
 they
 instilled
 in
 my


sister
 and
 I
 actually
 apply
 in
 the,
 you


know,
 capitalist
 world
 in
 United
 States.


uh
 for
 instance
 to
 always
 value


education
 because
 education
 is
 something


nobody
 can
 take
 away
 from
 you
 when
 you


go
 through
 something
 like


nationalization
 in
 in
 Czechoslovakia


people
 are
 used
 to
 losing
 their


possessions
 but
 you
 cannot
 lose
 your


education.
 So
 our
 parents
 were
 really


focused
 on
 that
 or
 you
 know
 my
 dad
 would


say
 whenever
 I
 I
 was
 a
 competitive


athlete
 crosscountry
 skier
 and
 whenever


I
 would
 fail
 somehow
 my
 equipment
 failed


etc
 my
 dad
 would
 be
 like
 oh
 that's
 great


uh
 you
 know
 nobody's
 going
 to
 remember


the
 fact
 that
 your
 bindings
 failed
 but


everybody's
 going
 to
 remember
 your


ranking
 and
 uh
 and
 it
 was
 one
 of
 those


wakeup
 calls
 to
 me
 early
 on
 that
 excuses


don't
 really
 matter
 because
 those
 are


forgotten
 even
 if
 they're
 good
 ones.
 and


that
 it's
 only
 the
 results
 that
 matter.


I
 have
 to
 say
 if
 you
 were
 a
 really
 good


cross
 or
 you
 moved
 to
 the
 wrong
 country,


you
 should
 have
 moved
 to
 Norway,
 right?


I
 I
 know
 I
 know
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


Norwegians
 who
 were
 kicking
 our
 butt.


Absolutely.
 But
 you
 were
 also
 interested


in
 music
 from
 early
 on,
 right?
 You


played
 a
 couple
 of
 instruments.
 Yeah,


very
 much.
 Uh
 you
 know
 there's
 a
 saying


that
 every
 Czech
 is
 a
 musician.
 Uh
 and


there
 are
 deep
 classical
 music
 roots
 in


the
 country
 and
 my
 sister
 played
 a


piano.
 I
 played
 cello
 and
 then
 after


playing
 cello
 for
 about
 three
 years
 I


then
 played
 Spanish
 guitar
 and
 my


teacher
 actually
 is
 wonderful.
 He
 was
 a


blind
 teacher
 who
 was
 a
 skier
 as
 well.


So
 I
 was
 his
 teacher
 and
 I
 was
 this


guide
 for
 skiing
 and
 uh
 and
 he
 was


teaching
 me
 this
 wonderful
 uh
 art
 and
 uh


it
 was
 a
 great
 long
 relationship
 and
 by


the
 way
 I
 just
 reconnected
 with
 him


about
 six
 months
 ago
 which
 is


incredible.
 That's
 good.
 Now,
 you've


been
 um
 you've
 been
 doing
 incredible


work
 at
 HBO,
 Netflix,
 uh
 and
 YouTube


before
 you
 stepped
 in
 as
 a
 CEO
 of
 Warner


Music
 Group.
 So,
 just
 um
 take
 us
 through


the
 the
 journey
 here.
 I
 started
 like


many
 others
 in
 a
 windowless
 mail
 room
 in


a
 talent
 agency,
 stapling
 pictures


together
 with
 resumes
 which
 got
 mailed


to
 casting
 agents.
 Those
 were
 my
 humble


beginnings
 until
 I
 got
 promoted
 to
 an


assistant.
 And
 I
 was
 pretty
 much
 doing


this
 for
 the
 first
 three
 years
 of
 my


career.
 And
 then
 early
 on
 I
 joined
 a


mutual
 fund
 company
 which
 was
 a
 movie
 uh


co-inancing
 company
 early
 on
 in
 in in


the
 90s
 and
 that's
 what
 I
 learned
 how
 to


value
 content
 how
 it's
 paid
 for
 and
 how


it's
 distributed
 from
 there
 went
 to
 HBO


uh
 that
 was
 at
 its
 height
 uh
 you
 know


Sex
 in
 the
 City
 Sopranos
 etc
 and
 I


worked
 on
 the
 international
 side


launching
 territories
 HBO
 India
 HBO


Korea
 and
 then
 uh
 then
 I
 did
 a
 about


threeear
 stint
 in
 a
 a
 VC
 funded
 startup


in
 the
 year
 2000
 that
 was
 like
 a
 risky


move
 right
 from
 high-flying
 HBO
 to


completely
 unknown
 company
 on
 the


internet
 which
 was
 just
 slow
 you
 know


right
 as
 the
 bust
 happened
 right
 in


March
 2000
 the
 docom
 bust
 and
 uh
 uh
 but


you
 know
 our
 company
 we
 we
 were
 uh


working
 through
 it
 and
 within
 3
 years
 I


ended
 up
 at
 Netflix
 which
 at
 that
 time


had
 roughly
 500,000
 subscribers
 and
 I


was
 you
 know
 DVD
 by
 mail
 and
 then
 2005


started
 to
 focus
 on
 streaming


because
 we
 we
 knew
 at
 some
 point
 we


wanted
 to
 transition
 the
 business
 and


disrupt
 our
 own
 disruption
 and
 uh
 so
 I
 I


started
 to
 work
 on
 that,
 built
 up
 the


team
 and
 you
 know
 the
 rest
 is
 history.


And
 then
 in
 2010


uh
 I
 was
 recruited
 uh
 to
 Google
 and
 and


joined
 YouTube
 and
 helped
 basically
 grow


it
 into
 what
 it
 is
 today.
 And
 you
 know


at
 that
 time
 it
 was
 roughly
 $450
 million


in
 revenue.
 was
 small,
 was
 very
 messy,


sued
 by
 lots
 of
 different
 people.
 And
 uh


and
 Eric
 Schmidt
 told
 me,
 "Figure
 out


how
 you
 stop
 them
 from
 sending
 us
 paper


and
 instead
 we
 send
 them
 paper,
 meaning


money,
 commercialize,
 you
 know,
 fix
 the


relationships,
 commercialize
 it,
 and


build
 a
 business."
 And
 um
 you
 know,
 and


we
 did
 that,
 you
 know,
 along
 with
 lots


of
 other
 people.
 Um
 why
 did
 you


transition
 into
 the
 music
 industry?
 when


you
 when
 you
 have
 two
 sort
 of
 hockey


sticks
 like
 this,
 you
 know,
 two
 uh
 big


uh
 disrupt
 uh
 disruptive
 forces
 scaling,


it
 doesn't
 really
 get
 any
 bigger
 than


that,
 right?
 Netflix
 or
 YouTube,
 it


doesn't
 get
 any
 bigger.
 So,
 you
 have
 to


actually
 set
 your
 sights
 on
 something


smaller
 and
 and
 more
 focused.
 So,
 I


chose
 music
 because
 I
 love
 music.
 Uh
 we


spoke
 about
 that.
 Uh
 I
 think
 music
 has


this
 incredible
 power
 of
 being


absolutely
 ubiquitous.
 Everybody
 in
 the


world
 has
 some
 kind
 of
 relationship
 with


music
 and
 uh
 everybody
 has
 a
 soundtrack


to
 their
 life.
 Music
 is
 like
 a
 time


stamp
 basically.
 You
 know
 there's
 a


bunch
 of
 time
 stamps
 throughout
 your


life.
 And
 um
 you
 know
 I
 have
 this


favorite
 saying
 that
 art
 decorates
 walls


but
 music
 decorates
 time.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 very
 powerful.
 And
 because
 of


that
 music
 goes
 through
 ups
 and
 downs
 in


the
 industry
 but
 it's
 resilient
 and
 gets


through
 all
 the
 downs.
 And
 I
 think
 it's


incredibly
 interesting
 to
 work
 in
 a


company
 transitioning
 company
 from
 one


thing
 that
 it
 that
 it
 has
 been
 to


something
 new
 that
 it
 that
 it
 will
 be.


And
 uh
 I
 just
 find
 that
 intellectually


stimulating
 and
 it's
 it's
 fun
 to
 work
 on


that.
 It's
 amazing
 when
 you
 have


reunions
 and
 you
 put
 on
 the
 music,
 you


play
 it
 at
 the
 time.
 I
 mean
 my
 you
 are


just
 back
 there,
 you
 know.
 Yeah,


exactly.
 No,
 but
 it
 invokes
 emotions,


right?
 That's
 that's
 what
 happens.
 What


do
 you
 listen
 to
 now?
 Uh
 uh
 well


obviously
 I
 listen
 to
 all
 of
 our
 artists


before
 their
 music
 is
 released,
 you


know,
 sort
 of
 like
 an
 internal
 system


for
 that.
 So
 I
 do
 all
 of
 it
 and
 it's


kind
 of
 fun
 to
 do
 that,
 right?
 And
 then


kind
 of
 try
 to
 imagine
 how
 that's
 going


to
 do
 and
 then
 kind
 of
 look
 how
 it's


doing.
 So
 So
 I
 like
 playing
 that
 game


with
 myself.
 And
 what
 is
 your
 predictive


power?
 It's
 uh
 it's
 not
 so
 great.


And
 why
 and
 why
 and
 why
 do
 you
 think


that
 is?
 Because
 I
 haven't
 really


applied
 any
 system
 to
 it.
 I'm
 just
 doing


purely
 by
 a
 feel.
 And
 I
 think
 what
 you


have
 to
 do
 is
 you
 have
 to
 have
 some
 kind


of
 a
 method
 to
 the
 madness.
 You
 have
 to


figure
 out
 some
 patterns
 that
 you
 follow


and
 then
 eventually
 you
 start
 narrowing


your
 scope
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 and
 and
 you


get
 better
 at
 it.
 And
 and
 I
 noticed
 that


lots
 of
 uh
 folks
 who
 work
 here
 say
 in


ANR
 they
 have
 different
 approaches
 to


finding
 artists,
 selecting
 artists,


thinking
 about
 hits,
 etc.
 But
 they
 they


they
 have
 a
 system
 and
 I
 think
 that's


very
 very
 important
 to
 to
 have
 your


system
 because
 it
 just
 allows
 you
 to
 you


know
 progress
 and
 get
 better
 and
 so
 I


don't
 have
 it
 myself
 yet.
 I
 just
 kind
 of


do
 it
 for
 fun
 on
 the
 side.
 Now
 I
 asked


Daniel
 Eek
 the
 founder
 of
 uh
 you
 know


Spotify
 what
 he
 thought
 I
 should
 ask
 you


and
 so
 he
 had
 a
 question
 here.
 I've


asked
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 you
 see.
 So
 um


what's
 what
 his
 uh
 question
 is
 what's


what's
 been
 the
 biggest
 cultural


adjustment
 you
 have
 to
 make
 going
 from
 a


technology
 company
 first
 like
 YouTube
 to


a
 creative
 company
 like
 uh
 Warner
 Music


Group.
 I
 think
 there
 there
 are
 two
 I'll


name
 two.
 The
 first
 one
 is
 uh
 I
 think


there
 is
 this
 unfair
 assumption
 that


everybody
 in
 digital
 world
 has
 of
 let's


say
 uh
 content
 companies
 that
 that
 they


don't
 like
 technology.
 Uh
 and
 when
 you


come
 into
 a
 company
 uh
 like
 Warner


Music,
 the
 what
 you
 realize
 that
 all


employees
 want
 it.
 They
 all
 have
 it
 in


their
 personal
 lives.
 They
 have
 their


banking
 apps.
 They
 have
 their,
 you
 know,


private
 chauffeur
 apps.
 Whatever
 it
 is,


they're
 living
 their
 life
 online
 like


very
 very
 well,
 but
 they
 may
 not
 have
 it


in
 their
 professional
 life.
 Not
 because


they
 don't
 want
 it.
 It
 just
 hasn't
 been


built
 for
 them
 and
 u
 hasn't
 been
 made


available,
 but
 they
 want
 it.
 And
 I
 think


there's
 just
 been
 this
 my
 assumption
 was


like,
 yeah,
 people
 don't
 want
 it.
 They


actually
 do.
 So,
 we've
 been
 working


really
 hard
 to
 obviously
 fix
 that
 and


and
 provide
 as
 as
 many
 of
 these
 tools
 as


possible.
 So,
 that's
 one.
 So,
 there
 was


a
 very
 pleasant
 surprise.
 And
 I
 would


say
 the
 the
 other
 is
 uh
 uh
 culturally


the
 organizations
 in
 most
 media


companies
 are
 set
 up
 in
 very
 distributed


manners
 with
 lots
 of
 different
 P&Ls
 and


lots
 of
 different
 infrastructures
 and
 in


today's
 world
 they
 can
 function
 like


global
 companies
 can
 function
 in
 much


much
 simpler
 setup.
 So
 I
 think
 but
 that


doesn't
 that
 has
 to
 come
 with
 cultural


change
 right
 it
 cannot
 happen
 on
 its
 own


but
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 that's
 a
 an


important
 cultural
 difference
 let's
 say


from
 technology
 companies
 or
 from
 you


know
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 companies
 in
 other


industries
 which
 uh
 have
 come
 up
 with
 a


simpler
 organizational
 design
 Robert


there
 seems
 to
 be
 so
 many
 ways
 the
 music


industry
 is
 changing
 just
 now
 right
 uh


it's
 changing
 in
 so
 many
 different


dimensions


um
 what
 do
 you
 think
 are
 the
 main


changes
 we
 are
 seeing
 just
 now
 or
 the


most
 important
 ones
 So
 one
 obviously


there's
 one
 big
 change
 which
 I
 obviously


was
 part
 of
 which
 is
 democratization
 of


distribution.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 Uh
 the
 the


uh
 music
 companies
 uh
 were
 the
 ones
 who


got
 you
 distributed
 in
 a
 physical


format.
 Right.
 There
 was
 lots
 of


inventory
 issues
 and
 shelf
 space
 issues


and
 all
 of
 that
 to
 get
 sorted
 out.
 And


today
 it's
 in
 digital
 distribution.
 It's


simpler
 and
 anyone
 can
 publish.
 So
 the


role
 that
 we
 or
 the
 music
 companies


played
 in
 distribution
 has
 decreased.


Obviously
 uh
 there
 is
 still
 a
 role
 for


it
 because
 it
 has
 to
 get
 pushed
 through


supply
 chains
 into
 many
 different


distribution
 points
 and
 there's


complexity
 involved
 with
 that.
 But
 it's


it's
 decreased
 versus
 the
 past.
 But
 in
 a


world
 where
 anyone
 can
 publish,
 no
 one


can
 be
 heard.
 The
 level
 of
 noise


increases
 so
 much
 that
 it's
 really
 hard


to
 succeed
 on
 your
 own.


on
 a
 repeated
 basis.
 You
 can
 have
 like
 a


one-off
 success,
 but
 if
 you
 want
 to
 do


this
 as
 a
 career,
 you
 want
 to
 succeed,


you
 want
 to
 build
 catalog,
 you
 want
 to


build
 lots
 of
 value,
 it's
 a
 very
 uh
 it's


it's
 a
 difficult
 job.
 And
 for
 that,
 you


need
 a
 team
 and
 you
 need
 global


infrastructure,
 which
 we
 have,
 you
 know,


the
 the
 large
 companies,
 you
 need
 global


infrastructure
 all
 around
 the
 world
 that


helps
 you
 break
 through
 the
 clutter.
 And


that
 becomes
 a
 combination
 of
 both
 uh


technology
 because
 you
 need
 to
 collect


lots
 of
 different
 data
 and
 know
 how
 to


use
 it
 and
 also
 creative
 prowess
 around


each
 of
 the
 artists
 and
 what
 to
 do
 with


their
 brand
 and
 with
 their
 art.
 So,
 so


it's
 become
 uh
 much
 more
 sort
 of


integrated
 business
 between
 technology


and
 creative
 on
 the
 global
 scale
 still


with
 with
 infrastructure
 that
 we
 can


unleash
 everywhere.
 So
 I
 think
 our
 value


has
 shifted
 decreased
 on
 the


distribution
 side
 and
 increased
 on


breaking
 through
 the
 clutter.
 What's
 the


most
 important
 thing
 you
 you
 add
 here
 um


as
 a
 record
 label
 and
 then
 how
 does
 it


change
 during
 the
 life
 cycle
 of
 an


artist?
 Let's
 just
 start
 with
 the


beginning.
 How
 do
 you
 how
 do
 how
 do
 you


find
 them
 and
 what
 do
 you
 add
 in
 the


beginning?
 I'll
 uh
 I'll
 I'll
 give
 you
 so


so
 we
 are
 one
 of
 the
 companies
 that


actually
 has
 a
 great
 DNA
 and
 history
 in


discovering
 artists
 very
 early.
 Yeah.


Whether
 it
 was
 uh
 Ed
 Sheeran,
 uh
 Bruno


Mars,
 Dual
 Lipa,
 Cardi
 B,


um
 Zack
 Brian,
 you
 know,
 Benson
 Boon,


etc.
 It
 could
 go
 on.
 So
 artist


development
 is
 very
 core
 to
 what
 we
 do.


I
 I
 sat
 down
 with,
 you
 know,
 when
 I


started,
 every
 time
 I
 ran
 into
 an


artist,
 I
 would
 ask,
 you
 know,
 they


would
 tell
 me,
 "Oh,
 you
 have
 some


amazing
 people
 in
 your
 company.
 It's


awesome."
 I
 was
 like, "Yeah,
 tell
 me


who."
 And
 they
 would
 give
 me
 the
 names


immediately.
 I
 just
 stepped
 up
 an
 email


and
 emailed
 that
 person.
 And
 so
 many


times
 they're
 like
 mid-level
 executives.


And
 so
 I
 was
 like, "Hey,
 I'd
 like
 to


meet
 you."
 So
 I
 would
 meet
 with
 them.
 So


So
 there
 was
 this
 one
 ANR
 exec
 that
 um


that
 I
 met
 with
 and
 I
 was
 asking
 her
 the


same
 question.
 How
 do
 you
 find
 artists?


how
 do
 you
 find
 somebody
 that
 you


believe
 in
 that
 you
 think
 is
 going
 to


develop
 in
 a
 superstar?
 And
 she
 was


telling
 me,
 um,
 I
 look
 for
 their


connection
 with
 the
 audience
 before
 I


even
 listen
 to
 their
 voice.
 And
 I
 was


thinking,
 oh,
 it's
 interesting.
 How
 do


you
 do
 that?
 You
 you
 you
 look
 at
 the


likes
 online
 or
 like
 how
 do
 you
 discern


or
 comments,
 etc.
 He's
 like,
 no,
 I'm


watching
 the
 audience.
 I
 was
 like,
 what


do
 you
 mean?
 And
 like
 and
 live
 stream


like
 no,
 I
 go
 to
 the
 shows.
 I
 was
 like


and
 you
 know
 this
 is
 a
 very
 young


executive
 by
 the
 way
 like
 you
 know
 in


20s
 and
 I
 was
 like
 well
 but
 I
 thought


that's
 what
 the
 older
 ANR
 guys
 were


doing.
 I
 was
 like
 well
 I
 do
 that
 too.
 I


was
 like
 and
 how
 does
 that
 work?
 She's


like
 well
 I
 watch
 the
 audience
 and
 if


the
 audience
 is
 an
 emotional
 connection


to
 the
 artist
 that
 is
 priceless
 and
 it's


and
 it's
 it's
 amazing
 and
 if
 it's
 there


and
 by
 the
 way
 the
 connection
 is
 either


they're
 they
 have
 misty
 eyes
 or
 crying


or
 they're
 shrieking
 or
 they're


laughing.
 And
 if
 it's
 there,
 then
 we


work
 with
 them
 on
 the
 art
 and
 develop


their
 voice
 and
 just
 like
 develop
 the


artist
 skill
 set
 and
 the
 connection
 is


there.
 And
 now
 now
 we
 have
 something


that
 we
 can
 really
 build
 a
 longlast


long-lasting
 career
 on.
 I
 was
 like


interesting.
 And
 she's
 like
 and
 you
 know


what's
 important
 that
 if
 it's
 a
 female


that
 that
 audience
 is
 teen
 girls
 because


they're
 the
 earliest
 adopters,
 you
 know,


and
 Shakira
 and
 Beyonce,
 etc.,
 right?


and
 and
 if
 it's
 boys,
 it's
 even
 more


important.
 So,
 it's
 basically,
 you
 know,


I
 just
 described
 to
 you
 a
 system
 that


that
 NR
 executive
 has
 to
 find
 uh
 artists


early
 and
 build
 them
 into
 stars.
 And


philos
 and
 philosophically,
 what
 is
 it


that
 creates
 that
 connection?
 It
 could


be
 their
 attitude.
 It
 could
 be
 uh
 their


lyrics,
 you
 know,
 the
 topics
 that
 they


care
 about.
 Uh
 I
 think
 it's
 deeply


personal
 but
 it's
 like
 it's
 got
 to
 be


there
 and
 it's
 what
 makes
 them
 unique


and
 uh
 but
 the
 thing
 that's
 interesting


is
 like
 what
 I
 just
 described
 to
 you


it's
 not
 that
 you
 can
 like
 force
 this
 on


another
 ANR
 executive
 right
 people
 have


different
 systems
 I'm
 giving
 you
 one
 but


it's
 like
 this
 is
 a
 young
 person
 who's


very
 very
 successful
 and
 um
 and
 then
 has


discovered
 an
 artist
 and
 has
 a
 system


can
 that
 connectivity
 be
 learned
 you


think
 can
 an
 artist
 learn
 to
 connect
 uh


Uh
 I
 think
 I
 think
 people
 try
 over
 time.


it
 pro
 I
 I
 think
 it
 probably
 can
 be
 but


it's
 uh
 it's
 easier
 to
 learn
 like
 if
 you


have
 it
 it's
 easier
 to
 obviously
 develop


your
 art
 then
 learn
 the
 connectivity
 but


I
 think
 it
 comes
 with
 uh
 probably


increased
 focus
 you
 know
 to
 learn
 that


connectivity
 but
 uh
 but
 you
 know
 this
 is


all
 like
 the
 beginning
 the
 nucleus
 of
 it


right
 but
 then
 what
 we
 have
 to
 do
 is


figure
 out
 okay
 how
 do
 we
 grow
 the


artist
 audience
 and
 and
 not
 go
 into
 big


concert
 uh
 venues
 immediately
 that
 would


be
 half
 empty,
 but
 instead
 grow
 them


gradually
 and
 uh
 and
 build
 up
 a
 uh
 you


know
 group
 of
 fans
 that
 will
 be
 with


them
 forever
 and
 from
 you
 just
 need
 to


build
 a
 core
 from
 which
 everything


grows.
 So
 let's
 say
 so
 let's
 say
 now
 I


have
 my
 guitar
 I'm
 playing
 in
 Cton
 Town,


you
 know,
 in
 some
 kind
 of
 uh
 bar
 uh


Robert
 Kinsel
 comes
 in.
 It's
 just
 like


hey
 look
 at
 that
 guy
 Nikolai.
 He's
 got


great
 uh
 rapport
 with
 the
 audience.
 So


you
 come
 to
 me
 and
 but
 just
 what
 do
 you


do
 with
 me
 the
 next
 couple
 of
 years
 you


know
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 build
 it
 it


all
 depends
 like
 obviously
 what
 you
 need


specifically
 right
 which
 also
 varies


because
 sometimes
 artists
 are
 also


songwriters
 so
 they
 write
 their
 own


music
 uh
 you
 know
 Bruno
 Mars
 was
 an


example
 of
 that
 he's
 an
 excellent


songwriter
 and
 that's
 how
 he
 started
 and


then
 and
 then
 he
 started
 to
 uh
 sing
 his


music
 so
 initially
 maybe
 you
 may
 be
 a


songwriter
 and
 you're
 writing
 for
 other


people
 and
 then
 you
 try
 your
 own
 luck


right
 with
 that
 and
 it's
 like
 you
 know


deciding
 which
 ones
 you
 do
 which
 ones


you
 don't
 or
 it's
 a
 collaboration
 with


somebody.
 So
 so
 many
 times
 it's
 also


about
 not
 just
 about
 like
 perfecting


your
 voice
 but
 it's
 also
 about


collaborating
 with
 the
 right
 people


whether
 it's
 songwriters
 that
 you
 work


with
 or
 collaborations
 from
 uh
 from


singing
 perspective.
 So
 so
 it
 all


depends
 on
 who
 the
 artist
 is
 and
 uh
 and


what
 they
 need.
 Uh
 there's
 tour
 support,


right?
 Like
 helping
 them
 set
 up
 uh
 small


tours
 that
 help
 them
 start
 building
 the


nucleus
 of
 the
 super
 super
 fans,
 right?


That
 will
 be
 with
 them.
 Um
 you
 know,
 all


of
 that's
 work
 and
 you
 know
 there's
 a


you
 know
 really
 great
 example
 with
 Teddy


Swims,
 you
 know,
 one
 of
 our,
 you
 know,


current
 stars
 who,
 you
 know,
 five
 years


ago
 wasn't
 and
 he
 has
 just
 done
 an


incredible
 job
 uh
 with
 us
 to
 build
 up


his
 core
 audience.
 he
 would
 travel
 to


Europe,
 do
 small
 shows
 and
 build
 it,
 you


know,
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 we
 we
 do


research,
 right?
 We
 look
 based
 on
 a
 lot


of
 the
 data
 that
 we
 have.
 It's
 like


where
 where
 they
 should
 tour,
 what
 they


should
 do,
 right?
 Where
 the
 focus
 should


be.
 So,
 it's
 like
 it
 becomes
 a
 deep


collaboration.
 How
 is
 it
 different
 when


it's
 a
 long
 time
 established
 group,


let's
 say
 Cold
 Play
 or
 you
 know,
 one
 of


these,
 what
 do
 they
 need
 help?
 What
 do


why
 do
 they
 need
 help?
 Yeah,
 that's
 uh
 I


asked
 them
 the
 other
 day
 the
 same
 thing.


How
 why
 do
 you
 need
 help?
 And
 look,
 the


if
 you're
 an
 aspiring
 artist,
 you
 want


to
 become
 big
 and
 relevant,
 right?
 If


you're
 a
 huge
 uh
 superstar
 or
 band
 like


Coldplay,
 then
 you
 want
 to
 remain


relevant,
 right?
 Of
 course,
 you
 know,
 so


it's
 like
 you're
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 heap


and
 you
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 stay


there.
 And
 again,
 it's
 in
 the
 world


that's
 increasingly
 noisy,
 right?
 and


across
 all
 forms
 of
 media,
 but
 in
 music


it's
 very
 noisy,
 but
 across
 like


everything
 it's
 very
 hard.
 So,
 so
 you


want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you're
 creating


hits
 and
 that
 people
 around
 the
 world


hear
 your
 new
 art
 and
 you
 know,
 so
 we


just
 did
 a
 new
 album
 with
 co-play
 in


October
 and
 it
 was
 a
 great
 success,
 but


like
 you
 know,
 all
 of
 us
 were
 nervous,


right?
 And
 everybody
 worked
 extremely


hard
 to
 make
 it
 succeed.
 Nobody
 sleeps


on
 their
 lures
 just
 because
 it's
 a
 it's


coldplay.
 it's
 actually
 we're
 that
 much


more
 nervous
 because
 we
 want
 to
 really


make
 sure
 that
 it
 delivers
 on
 its


promise
 and
 um
 so
 so
 I
 think
 the
 you


know
 if
 you
 if
 you
 look
 at
 it
 today
 no


matter
 how
 much
 distribution
 has


democratized
 all
 the
 big
 stars
 are


signed
 with
 large
 music
 companies
 and
 um


and
 because
 it
 it
 it
 takes
 a
 village
 it


takes
 a
 village
 again
 if
 you're
 looking


for
 sustained
 and
 repeatable
 success
 if


you're
 just
 looking
 for
 oneoff
 thing


doesn't
 matter
 the
 The
 concert
 business


seems
 to
 have
 changed
 and
 just
 become,


you
 know,
 a
 bit
 grander
 in
 a
 way,
 right?


So
 Adele
 built$und00
 million
 pop-up


stadium.
 Many
 artists
 do
 like
 10
 nights


at
 Wembley.
 I
 mean,
 Taylor
 Swift,
 I


guess,
 is
 a
 story
 in
 herself,
 but
 um


yeah,
 cold
 play
 massive
 tour.


Absolutely.
 How
 should
 we
 how
 should
 we


read
 that?
 What
 is
 it
 a
 sign
 of?
 Well,
 I


think
 initially
 there
 was
 a
 penta
 demand


from
 COVID,
 right?
 obviously,
 but
 then


it's
 a
 thing.
 And
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 in
 a


world
 that's
 increasingly
 digital,


people
 crave
 physical
 experiences.


That's
 it.
 It's
 as
 simple
 as
 that.
 And


if
 if
 music
 uh
 decorates
 your
 time,


right?
 It's
 soundtrack
 to
 your
 life.


When
 you
 have
 couple
 favorite
 bands
 or


or
 artists
 and
 they're
 they're
 playing


in
 a
 venue
 near
 you,
 you
 go,
 right?


Because
 it's
 like
 you
 like
 the


collective
 enjoyment.
 I
 think
 I
 think


when
 you
 can
 enjoy
 obviously
 a
 lot
 of


people
 enjoy
 music
 by
 themselves
 right


you're
 working
 out
 biking
 running


whatever
 uh
 or
 even
 just
 at
 home
 working


but
 when
 people
 enjoy
 it
 the
 most
 is


when
 they're
 sharing
 it
 together
 w
 with


others
 and
 usually
 they
 start
 moving


they
 start
 dancing
 right
 and
 it
 just


it's
 like
 expression
 of
 joy
 so
 so
 I


think
 you
 know
 live
 music
 is
 here
 with


us
 to
 stay
 and
 and
 will
 be
 will
 continue


to
 be
 very
 successful
 are
 you
 a
 good


dancer
 nope
 you
 should
 ask
 my


My
 my
 wife
 my
 wife
 is
 Dominican
 which


means
 she's
 an
 excellent
 dancer
 and
 uh


and
 she
 will
 criticize
 me
 all
 the
 way


till
 Sunday
 about
 my
 dance
 moves.
 How


has
 um
 streaming
 uh
 the
 streaming


concept
 uh
 changed
 what
 you
 do?


Streaming
 is
 more
 efficient


distribution,
 right?
 I
 I
 spoke
 about
 in


the
 past
 when
 it
 was
 uh
 you
 know
 whether


it
 was
 LPS
 or
 CDs
 or
 tapes
 uh
 you
 know


there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 inventory,
 right?
 So


you
 know
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 are in


the
 inventory
 business
 it's
 it's
 not


that
 much
 fun
 right
 like
 there's
 returns


and
 breakage
 and
 all
 of
 that.
 So
 u
 music


is
 very
 fluid.
 It's
 perfectly
 aligned


with
 the
 internet.
 It's
 very
 efficient


distribution
 and
 what
 it
 does
 is
 it


reaches
 more
 people
 than
 before
 and
 uh


and
 it
 allows
 people
 in
 a
 non-demand


fashion.
 Right?
 People
 could
 hear
 music


before
 through
 radio.
 you're
 sitting
 in


the
 taxi
 or
 in
 a
 restaurant
 and
 you
 hear


it,
 but
 in
 a
 way
 in
 a
 personalized
 way


that
 you
 can
 select
 what
 you
 want
 and


personalize
 it
 and
 and
 have
 your


playlist
 that
 is
 now
 accessible
 to
 a
 lot


more
 people.
 So
 it
 has
 grown
 the


business
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 you
 know


obviously
 credit
 goes
 to
 Daniel
 for


Daniel
 Ike
 for
 uh
 driving
 Spotify
 you


know
 through
 the
 decades
 and
 building


the
 business
 as
 well
 as
 others
 you
 know


what
 we
 did
 at
 YouTube
 and
 and
 you
 know


Apple
 and
 and
 uh
 Amazon
 etc.
 So
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 lot
 of
 subscribers
 around
 the


world
 but
 still
 even
 today
 we
 are


lagging
 uh
 esot
 subscription
 video
 on


demand
 which
 you
 know
 we
 shouldn't
 right


so
 you
 can
 imagine
 that
 there
 is
 still
 a


lot
 more
 addressable
 audience
 for
 us
 to


take
 and
 uh
 and
 that
 gap
 is
 even
 bigger


outside
 United
 States
 you
 know
 in
 lots


of
 developing
 markets
 so
 a
 lot
 a
 lot


more
 room
 to
 grow
 music
 is
 cheap
 no
 it's


it's
 probably
 the
 best
 deal
 that


consumers
 get
 in
 anything.
 Yeah,
 it's


definitely
 cheaper
 than
 X.
 Like
 if
 you


think
 about
 it's
 cheaper
 than
 anything


because
 it's
 been
 lagging
 inflation
 for


a
 very
 long
 time.
 Why
 is
 it
 so
 cheap?


Because
 uh
 and
 I
 don't
 mean
 it
 as
 a


criticism.
 It's
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 industry


post
 Napster
 and
 Kazan
 and
 all
 the
 file


sharing
 services
 was
 obviously
 uh
 on
 its


knees
 and
 then
 the
 streaming
 services
 uh


came
 and
 and
 drove
 growth
 and
 pricing


just
 remained
 the
 same
 from
 the
 time
 uh


any
 of
 those
 services
 got
 established.


Nobody
 has
 moved
 price
 up
 despite
 you


know
 whatever
 inflation
 there
 may
 may


have
 been.
 But
 it
 was
 the
 right
 choice


because
 that
 was
 the
 time
 to
 hunt,
 you


know,
 hunt
 for
 new
 subscribers,
 right?


And
 just
 focus
 on
 volume
 and
 focus
 on


growth.
 And
 I
 think
 now
 we're
 entering


the
 era
 where
 it's
 important
 to
 do
 both


hunting
 in
 places
 where
 the
 penetration


is
 very
 very
 low
 and
 continue
 to
 do
 what


we've
 done
 in
 the
 past.
 But
 then
 in


territories
 which
 are
 where
 the


penetration
 is
 high,
 maybe
 not
 as
 high


as
 yet,
 but
 like
 high,
 then
 we
 also


start
 harvesting
 on
 price,
 right?
 And


increasing
 that.
 So,
 so
 I
 think
 you
 know


whatever
 worked
 in
 the
 past
 15
 years


doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 applied
 exactly
 the


same
 way
 to
 the
 next
 15
 years
 and
 we


just
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 just
 need
 to
 be
 a


little
 bit
 more
 uh
 laser
 focused
 and


audience
 segmented
 in
 our
 approaches.
 So


when
 you
 say
 harvest
 you
 mean
 increase


prices
 slowly
 and
 carefully
 until
 just


below
 the
 point
 just
 below
 the
 point


where
 they
 live.
 Correct.
 Correct.
 Which


which
 of
 course
 nobody
 wants,
 right?
 We


don't
 want
 that.
 The
 DSPs
 don't
 want
 it.


Uh,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to
 not


have
 a
 one-sizefits-all
 strategy,
 which


is
 what
 we
 all
 had,
 right,
 for
 15
 years,


which
 was
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 drive


growth.
 But
 now
 we
 got
 to
 have
 sort
 of


two
 sizes.
 So,
 let's
 say
 now
 uh
 the


value
 of
 music
 to
 the
 consumer
 is
 100.


Where
 does
 the
 money
 end
 up?
 So,
 what


goes
 to
 the
 artist,
 what
 goes
 to
 you


guys,
 what
 goes
 to
 streaming?
 It
 it
 all


depends
 on
 who
 the
 artist
 is.
 There's
 so


many
 that's
 one
 of the
 things
 I
 learned.


There's
 so
 many,
 you
 know,
 the
 company


has
 grown.
 It's
 been
 around
 for
 many,


many
 decades.
 And
 there,
 you
 know,


there's
 cataloges
 and
 there's
 new


releases.
 Uh
 there
 are
 distribution


deals.
 So
 the
 spectrum
 is
 really,
 really


wide.
 I
 mean,
 just
 think
 about
 it,


right?
 We
 have
 we
 have
 deep,
 deep


cataloges
 from
 Fleetwood
 to
 Joanie


Mitchell,
 the
 Eagles,
 you
 know,
 you
 got


David,
 right?
 Historic
 cataloges,
 which


is
 just
 incredible
 what
 happens.
 By
 the


way,
 my
 younger
 daughter,
 like
 one
 of


her
 one
 of
 her
 favorite
 bands
 is


Fleetwood
 Mac,
 right?
 She
 she's
 22
 now.


has
 been
 her
 favorite
 band
 since
 19
 and


it's
 just
 incredible
 the
 power
 it
 that


you
 know
 the
 power
 that
 it
 has.
 Yeah.


Yeah.
 Absolutely.
 Interestingly
 uh
 one


of
 the
 guys
 at
 Aha
 Mafu
 Wman
 he
 uh


suggested
 I
 asked
 you
 about
 this.
 So


kind
 of
 the
 the
 pedigree
 artist
 right?


Yes.
 Where
 old
 songs
 are
 becoming
 new


hits
 for
 new
 generations
 who
 they
 don't


care
 when
 it
 was
 made
 or
 whatever
 right.


So
 yes
 on
 that
 topic
 uh
 just
 what
 uh


what
 have
 contributed
 to
 this
 renewed


interest?
 So
 so
 I
 have
 to
 say
 actually


since
 you're
 speaking
 of
 AHA
 uh
 you
 know


I
 grew
 up
 in
 in
 a
 communist
 country


closed
 borders
 no
 no
 freedom
 of
 uh


choice
 of
 media
 or
 speech
 uh
 there
 was


very
 little
 imported
 music.
 Aha
 was
 one


of
 the
 LPs
 that
 I
 got.
 I
 think
 I
 had


like
 seven
 LPs
 when
 I
 was
 growing
 up.


Aha
 was
 one
 of
 them.
 And
 um
 so
 you
 know


the
 sun
 always
 shines
 on
 TV.
 Yeah.
 And


it's
 like
 it's
 uh
 you
 know
 it's
 like
 but


by by
 the
 way
 you
 know
 when
 I
 when
 I


said
 that
 art
 decorates
 walls
 and
 music


decorates
 time
 for
 me
 aa
 decorated
 my


time
 and
 like
 I
 know
 exactly
 where
 I
 was


you
 know
 in
 you
 know
 in
 the
 80s
 in
 in
 in


Czechoslovakia
 and
 the
 you
 know
 how
 it


made
 me
 feel
 then.
 Um
 the
 the
 renewal
 of


interest
 comes
 in
 different
 ways.
 one


which
 is
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 do
 these
 catalog


license
 l licensing
 deals
 with
 all
 kinds


of
 platforms
 and
 then
 if
 it's
 an
 open


platform
 sometimes
 users
 just
 users
 for


fun
 take
 the
 music
 and
 they
 do
 something


with
 it
 and
 attach
 it
 to
 a
 video
 and
 and


sometimes
 that
 takes
 off
 by
 the
 way


that's
 that's
 how
 Fleetwood
 Mac
 took
 off


you
 know
 and
 u
 uh
 on
 Tik
 Tok
 uh
 so
 it


happens
 that
 way
 in
 a
 very
 very
 organic


way
 right
 and
 this
 didn't
 used
 to
 be


there
 the
 other
 sort
 of
 well-managed


ways
 that
 this
 happens
 is
 uh


when
 current
 artists
 want
 to
 remake
 a


song
 that
 was
 iconic.
 David
 Gha
 is
 like


a
 master
 at
 this,
 right?
 David
 got
 one


of
 one
 of
 our
 artists.
 He's
 a
 famous
 uh


DJ
 and
 producer
 and
 he
 he
 just
 uh
 loves


to
 find
 you
 know
 just
 iconic
 songs
 and


remake
 them
 and
 and
 he
 just
 he
 just


remade
 Forever
 Young
 right
 with
 Ava
 Max


and
 uh
 and
 Alpha
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 and


it's
 like
 suddenly
 the
 song
 is
 just


charting
 everywhere.
 Uh,
 but
 by
 the
 way,


the
 I
 I
 have
 to
 I
 have
 to
 say
 that
 one


of
 the
 most
 incredible
 stories
 over
 the


last
 six
 to
 nine
 months
 has
 been
 Lincoln


Park.
 It's
 a
 band
 that
 released
 their


first
 album
 with
 us
 in
 in
 the
 year


2000.
 A
 few
 years
 ago,
 their
 lead
 singer


passed
 away.
 They
 went
 through
 replacing


uh
 replacing


him.
 The
 the
 resurgence
 that
 they
 had


last
 fall
 was
 like
 unlike
 anything
 we've


ever
 seen.
 The
 success
 of
 their
 new


album
 was
 insane.
 The
 pre-sales
 were
 the


highest
 in
 Warner's
 history
 and
 and


their
 catalog
 just
 shot
 through
 the


roof.
 And
 this
 is
 a
 band
 that's
 been


with
 us
 for
 25
 years.
 And
 and
 it's
 just,


you
 know,
 nobody
 deserves
 the
 success


more
 than
 these
 guys.
 Uh
 but
 it's
 just


it's
 incredible
 when
 that
 audience
 is


there.
 It
 stays.
 It
 doesn't
 go
 away.
 And


uh
 and
 it
 just
 underscores
 the
 value
 of


IP
 despite
 whatever
 happens
 on
 a
 macro


level.
 What
 are
 the
 challenges
 when
 it


comes
 to
 copyright
 um
 and
 the
 reuse
 and


mashups
 of
 older
 music?
 Um
 the


challenges
 they've
 always
 been
 there
 uh


with
 the
 advent
 of
 social
 media,
 right?


And
 YouTube
 was
 the
 first
 one.
 So
 I


actually
 had
 the
 the
 privilege
 um
 of


working
 on
 that
 early
 on.
 This
 is
 like


what
 I
 referred
 to
 when
 Eric
 Schmidt


said,
 "Hey,
 figure
 out
 how
 you
 stop
 them


from
 sending
 us
 paper."
 And
 so
 we
 send


them
 paper
 and
 um
 um
 it's
 basically
 how


do
 you
 track


uh
 you
 know
 fragments
 of
 copyrights
 in


other
 copyrighted
 material
 or
 in
 other


videos
 or
 audio
 etc.
 and
 how
 do
 you


aortion
 the
 money,
 you
 know,
 and
 what


tools
 you
 give.
 And
 so
 early
 on
 at


YouTube,
 we
 built
 something
 called


content
 ID
 that
 allowed
 us
 to
 do
 that.


Basically,
 fingerprint
 the
 content
 and


then
 as
 people
 uploaded
 it
 to
 YouTube,


we
 would
 then
 be
 able
 to
 sort
 of
 parse


it
 out
 and
 then
 have
 commercial


relationships
 to
 give
 the
 copyright


holders
 the
 the
 ability
 to
 either
 block


it
 or
 track
 it
 or
 monetize
 it.
 And
 then


there
 had
 to
 be
 a
 commercial
 split


obviously
 negotiated
 for
 for
 that.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 uh
 you
 know
 that's
 the
 same


thing
 that
 will
 develop
 in
 the
 age
 of
 AI


because
 it's
 basically
 just
 UGC
 on


steroids
 and
 uh
 so
 it's
 just
 everything


is
 faster
 bigger
 and
 but
 uh
 I
 think


we've
 laid
 down
 a
 a
 really
 good


framework
 uh
 you
 know
 more
 than
 15
 years


ago
 for
 how
 to
 do
 this
 and
 we
 can
 learn


from
 that.
 What's
 the
 catalog
 you
 wish


you
 had?


more
 more
 and
 more
 there's
 so
 much
 uh


you
 know
 there
 there
 are
 companies
 I


have
 all
 the
 cataloges
 you
 haven't
 got


which
 one
 do
 you
 want
 to
 buy


um
 it
 depends
 what
 the
 price
 is
 what


multiple
 are
 you
 charging
 just
 average


average
 like
 you
 know
 there's
 obviously


iconic
 iconic
 music
 like
 Michael
 Jackson


right
 and
 queen
 again
 it's
 I
 just
 named


two
 where
 I
 also
 had
 the
 LPS
 behind
 Iron


Curtain
 in
 Czechoslovakia,
 right?
 So,


you
 know,
 it
 just
 kind
 of
 enforced
 that,


but
 you
 know,
 uh
 uh
 you
 know,
 those
 two


stuck
 with
 me
 along
 with
 aa
 back
 then.


Um
 it's,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 love


uh
 yeah,
 I
 mean
 those
 two
 I
 would


obviously
 get.
 Unfortunately,


competition
 has
 them,
 but
 uh
 such
 is


life,
 but
 we
 have
 some
 really
 amazing


ones
 ourselves
 which
 I'm
 tremendously


proud
 of.
 Another
 one
 I'm
 really
 proud


of
 is
 Tracy
 Chapman
 is
 just,
 you
 know,


that
 one
 for
 me
 timestamps
 my
 college


years
 here
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 right?


So,
 it's
 like
 different
 bands
 and
 and


different
 times.
 And
 it's
 just
 it
 was
 so


great
 to
 see
 her
 perform
 at
 the
 Grammys


a
 year
 ago.
 And
 um
 yeah,
 it's
 fun.
 Pink


Floyd.
 Yeah,
 Pink
 Floyd
 as
 well.
 Yeah,


that
 one
 for
 me
 would
 go
 to
 the
 80s
 in


my
 Yeah,
 it's
 kind
 of
 funny
 because
 we,


you
 know,
 we
 have
 a
 jingle
 on
 the


podcast
 and
 we
 uh
 we
 were
 thinking
 about


having
 this
 money,
 right?
 But
 it
 was
 so


expensive
 to
 uh
 to
 have
 it
 that
 we
 we


made
 our
 own
 instead.
 We
 kind
 of
 touched


on
 AI.
 Um
 just
 how
 how
 is
 it
 going
 to


change
 your
 business?
 I
 don't
 think
 we


know
 yet
 exactly.
 U
 but
 um
 we're
 very


focused
 on
 it.
 I
 think
 there's
 two


different
 ways
 uh
 that
 it
 can
 happen.


One
 just
 like
 for
 any
 other
 business


where
 you
 use
 it
 for
 efficiency,
 right?


So
 it's
 like
 that's
 got
 nothing
 to
 do


with
 music,
 right?
 is
 just
 like
 uh
 you


know
 standard
 practices
 and
 sort
 of


standardizing
 our
 workflows
 so
 that
 you


can
 then
 you
 know
 automate
 a
 lot
 of


those
 and
 and
 um
 um
 you
 know
 through


application
 of
 uh
 AI.
 The
 other
 which
 is


music
 specific
 is
 uh
 for
 what
 we


discussed
 which
 is
 how
 do
 you
 track
 and


attribute


but
 the
 other
 is
 also
 creation
 right
 and


um
 there's
 obviously
 uh
 creator
 tools


that
 exist
 today
 there'll
 be
 more
 in
 the


future
 whether
 open
 source
 or
 closed


source
 and
 and
 I
 think
 they'll


ultimately
 have
 two
 separate
 two
 types


of
 outputs
 one
 which
 is
 what
 I
 would


call
 more
 like
 background
 music
 that


it's
 not
 like
 associated
 with
 any
 artist


it's
 more
 like
 mood
 music
 and
 and
 I


think
 AI
 will
 probably
 take
 a
 big
 chunk


out
 of
 that
 because
 you
 know
 it
 will
 be


easier
 to
 do
 it
 at
 larger
 scale
 probably


more
 you
 know
 better
 precision
 etc.
 So
 I


would
 say
 that
 may
 be
 an
 area
 of
 music


that
 may
 be
 under
 attack.
 Pretty
 that's


that's
 pretty
 clear.
 The
 other
 is


artistcentric
 music
 and
 that's
 when
 I'm


so
 when
 you
 say
 mood
 when
 you
 say


moodcentric
 music
 what
 is
 that
 like


sundown?
 Uh
 it's
 yeah
 like
 I'm
 I'm
 not


thinking
 like
 when
 I
 listen
 to
 it
 I
 have


no
 idea
 who
 the
 artist
 is.
 It's
 more


like
 I'm
 working
 and
 it's
 just
 something


playing
 in
 the
 background.
 Elevator


music.
 uh
 you
 know
 it's
 just
 it
 doesn't


have
 any
 clear
 artist
 association.
 Yeah.


Or
 voice.
 Sometimes
 it
 doesn't
 even
 have


a
 voice
 but
 sometime
 you
 know
 many
 times


it
 does
 but
 it's
 it's
 not
 it's
 not


branded
 with
 any
 artist.
 Uh
 and
 that's


why
 I'm
 using
 the
 words
 artistentric
 for


the
 other
 bucket
 which
 is
 like
 you
 know


it's
 this
 this
 is
 either
 a
 sheiran
 or


it's
 substantially
 similar
 to
 aan
 right


or
 Bruno
 Mars
 or
 dualipa
 etc.
 And
 I


think
 this
 type
 of


content
 will
 uh
 we
 have
 to
 handle


extremely
 carefully
 because
 it's


obviously
 people's
 identity
 and
 their


livelihood.
 That's
 right.
 But
 like
 very


importantly
 their
 identity
 and
 and
 uh


and
 here
 it
 needs
 to
 be
 very
 permission


based
 whether
 they
 want
 to
 to
 be
 sort
 of


duplicated
 or
 not
 and
 whether
 it's
 their


existing
 songs
 or
 completely
 new
 songs.


But
 this
 is
 the
 area
 where
 we're
 really


focused
 a
 lot
 and
 our
 our
 work
 on
 this


is
 in
 with
 three
 constituents.
 One
 which


is
 the
 platforms
 themselves
 because


that's
 where
 the
 content
 ends
 up
 right.


So
 how
 we
 treat
 that
 the
 second
 is
 with


the
 with
 the
 uh
 model
 companies
 and
 the


third
 one
 is
 with
 governments
 sort
 of


and
 in
 this
 order
 in
 that
 ascending


order
 of
 priority
 because
 obviously
 with


government
 it's
 important
 to
 work
 on


things
 like
 uh
 uh
 AI
 um
 um
 no
 fakes
 act


etc.
 But
 sometimes
 it
 takes
 a
 long
 time


for
 it
 to
 actually
 come
 to
 fruition,


right?
 Doesn't
 mean
 we
 don't
 do
 it,
 but


we
 don't
 rely
 on.
 So
 it's
 uh
 it's
 a


multi
 multifront
 uh
 work.
 Robert,
 let's


uh
 change
 tack
 a
 bit.
 What's
 the


corporate
 culture
 like
 at
 Warner
 Music


Group?
 It's
 a
 I
 kind
 of
 call
 it
 a
 um
 15


depending
 on
 our
 market
 cap
 is
 15
 16
 17


18
 billion
 startup.
 uh
 because
 you
 know


you
 you
 want
 to
 retain
 that
 right
 as


much
 as
 possible
 to
 have
 the


entrepreneurial
 uh
 feeling
 at
 the
 same


time
 we're
 public
 company
 which
 means


lots
 of
 reporting
 and
 stability
 and


visibility
 etc.
 So
 I'm
 I'm
 constantly


sort
 of
 juggling
 these
 two
 feelings
 that


I
 want
 to
 move
 fast
 and
 disrupt
 things


fast
 as
 a
 startup
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I


got
 to
 operate
 within
 within
 uh
 you
 know


certain
 structures.
 Uh
 I
 would
 say
 it's


very


entrepreneurial.
 Um
 and
 and
 you
 kind
 of


have
 to
 I
 think
 the
 the
 best
 way
 to


tackle
 it
 is
 then
 you
 need
 to
 decide
 as


a
 leader
 which
 roles
 can
 be


entrepreneurial
 and
 which
 ones
 need
 to


be
 much
 more
 structured,
 right?
 Because


that's
 really
 the
 way
 to
 to
 manage


because
 you
 can't
 apply
 all
 the
 same
 to


everybody
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 that's
 a


mistake.
 So
 um
 so
 that's
 that's
 what
 I'm


feeling
 through
 and
 feeling
 my
 way


through
 and
 obviously
 the
 closer
 they


are
 to
 front
 line
 to
 the
 artist
 you
 want


them
 to
 be
 entrepreneurial
 and
 the


closer
 so
 the
 more
 right
 brain
 right
 the


more
 entrepreneurial
 you
 want
 them
 to
 be


and
 the
 more
 left
 brain
 the
 closer
 to


the
 center
 of
 the
 company
 the
 more


structure
 and
 then
 you
 can
 have
 like
 a


glo
 global
 platform
 that
 unleashes
 the


creative
 people.
 What
 are
 the
 challenges


of
 having
 the
 left
 and
 the
 right
 brain


in
 the
 same
 company?
 That's
 the
 fun
 of


putting
 that
 together
 because
 I
 don't


think
 that
 you
 can
 have
 a
 successful


uh
 company
 in
 our
 space
 that
 doesn't


have
 both.
 It
 doesn't
 work
 because
 if


it's
 only
 right,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 too


small.
 It's
 not
 going
 to
 scale
 enough.


And
 if
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 only
 left,
 it's


going
 to
 lose
 all
 the
 creativity
 and
 and


and
 deal
 flow,
 etc.
 So,
 so
 you
 need
 to


you
 need
 to
 find
 how
 to
 bridge
 it


together.
 And
 then
 you
 also
 realize
 that


when
 people
 spend
 more
 time
 together,


uh,


that
 they're
 not
 that
 different.
 I
 I


always
 used
 to
 say,
 you
 know,
 when
 I
 was


working
 at
 YouTube
 is
 that
 engineers
 are


like
 songwriters.
 They
 both
 write


software.
 It's
 just
 one
 is
 storytelling


software
 and
 the
 other
 one
 is
 like


utility
 software,
 right?
 One
 is
 code
 and


the
 other
 one
 is
 notes,
 but
 they're


writing
 something
 that's
 digitally


disseminated
 throughout
 the
 world.
 And


they
 kind
 of
 behave
 the
 same
 way.
 You


know,
 uh
 star
 engineers
 are
 uh
 you
 know,


they
 can
 be
 peculiar
 just
 like
 star


songwriters
 or
 artists.
 Have
 you
 adopted


any
 kind
 of
 unconventional
 cultural


practices?
 Do
 you
 have
 like
 concerts


every
 Friday?
 No,
 we
 don't.
 Uh
 you
 know,


I
 do
 all
 all
 hands
 meetings
 obviously


with
 the
 company,
 but
 that's
 not
 like


unconventional.


Um
 well,
 you
 know
 what
 I
 do
 is
 with
 all


of
 my
 reports,
 uh
 we
 do,
 you
 know,


Friday,
 uh
 sort
 of,
 you
 know,
 quick
 one


page
 of
 like
 what
 have
 you,
 you
 know,


what
 did
 you
 get
 done
 this
 week?
 Uh
 what


are
 some
 of
 the
 important
 things
 for


next
 week
 and
 what
 do
 you
 need
 from
 me?


And
 so
 all
 of
 my
 reports
 do
 this
 on


Friday.
 Uh
 I
 read
 it
 over
 the
 weekend


and
 I
 know
 what
 I'm
 going
 into
 next


week,
 right?
 and
 maybe
 I
 realize
 okay
 I


need
 to
 set
 up
 two
 meetings
 on
 this


topic
 because
 you
 know
 it
 came
 up


through
 the
 documents
 and
 it's
 a
 very


efficient
 way
 to
 understand
 uh
 what's


are
 the
 important
 things
 happening
 every


week
 in
 the
 company
 but
 also
 it
 gives


people
 like
 it
 forces
 people
 to


articulate
 their
 work
 I I
 read
 about


another
 person
 in
 the
 US
 who
 is
 asking


people
 to
 list
 five
 things
 they
 did


during
 the
 week
 yeah
 I
 think
 he
 copied


me
 I
 think
 he
 must
 have
 done
 uh
 what
 do


you
 look
 for
 when
 you
 hire
 somebody
 one


is
 an
 open
 mind.
 I
 think
 it's
 extremely


important
 because
 we
 live
 in
 a
 world


full
 of
 uncertainty
 and
 actually


increasing
 uncertainty


uh
 where
 visibility
 is
 limited
 and
 you


need
 people
 who
 know
 how
 to
 pivot
 on
 a


dime
 if
 necessary
 and
 have
 very
 very


open
 mind
 to
 rethink
 things.
 Uh
 I've


always
 look
 I
 always
 like
 disrupting


right
 like
 if
 you
 look
 at
 it
 from
 my


choices
 of


employment
 I
 was
 I
 was
 always
 disrupting


something
 and
 uh
 so
 it's
 very
 hard
 for


me
 to
 sit
 still
 and
 just
 kind
 of
 be
 part


of
 something
 that
 doesn't
 change
 like
 I


uh
 I
 do
 that.
 So
 I
 like
 to
 hire
 people


who
 have
 that
 in
 them
 because
 that


obviously
 makes
 my
 job
 easier
 too
 right


than
 you
 know
 through
 having
 sort
 of


lots
 of
 change
 makers.
 So
 change
 makers


with
 a
 very
 open
 mind
 because
 when
 you


have
 an
 open
 mind
 especially
 when
 you


work
 in
 a
 company
 like
 ours
 or
 any
 other


large
 multinational
 company
 you
 you
 have


to
 you
 know
 ultimately
 you
 get
 to
 matrix


setup
 you
 you
 can't
 have
 people
 who
 are


too
 rigid
 about
 things
 right
 they
 got
 to


be
 flexible
 to
 work
 with
 each
 other
 give


up
 control
 still
 demand
 you
 know


performance
 but
 you
 know
 it's
 okay
 to


not
 have
 control
 and
 you
 can
 still


succeed
 and
 uh
 these
 are
 important


traits.
 Do
 you
 disrupt
 your
 own


colleagues
 in
 uh
 what
 way
 do
 you
 mean?


Well,
 I
 mean
 you
 disrupt
 everything
 uh


left,
 right,
 and
 center.
 Do
 you
 disrupt


things
 internally
 in
 in
 the
 group?


uh
 they
 would
 probably
 say
 so


uh
 um
 you
 know
 I
 I
 I
 think
 I
 I I


actually
 work
 with
 our
 head
 of
 HR
 quite


a
 lot
 u
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 things


tie
 to
 you
 know
 uh
 what
 you
 know
 HR


processes
 are
 and
 how
 certain
 things
 are


set
 up
 and
 u
 and
 and
 also
 uh
 with
 our


head
 of
 comms
 because
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 I
 learned
 is
 that
 you
 can
 do
 what


you
 know
 all
 the
 different
 things
 but
 if


people
 don't
 know
 it
 if
 the
 message


doesn't
 translate
 if
 it
 doesn't
 resonate


you
 don't
 have
 people
 on
 board


ultimately
 it
 doesn't
 work
 right
 then


and
 you
 don't
 accomplish
 anything
 so
 uh


you
 know
 having
 having
 the
 collaboration


uh
 uh
 around
 communications
 becomes
 much


much
 more
 strategic
 how
 do
 you


communicate
 internally
 how
 do
 you
 get


people
 to
 climb
 the
 mountains


so
 a
 all
 hands
 meetings
 right
 uh
 and
 and


again
 those
 it's
 not
 just
 me
 right


obviously
 I
 include
 other
 colleagues


from
 the
 leadership
 team.
 How
 often
 how


often
 do
 you
 do
 them?
 Uh
 we
 do
 it
 every


six
 months
 and
 u
 and
 we'll
 see
 you
 know


if
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 uh
 uh
 in
 my
 previous


job
 we
 did
 it
 every
 quarter.
 Uh
 I
 didn't


want
 to
 overload
 it
 right
 away.
 We
 have


a
 lot
 of
 things
 to
 do,
 lots
 of
 lots
 of


change.
 But
 now
 we're
 doing
 it
 every
 six


months.
 Uh
 and
 um
 but
 you
 know
 brings


the
 company
 together
 which
 is
 important.


Uh
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 do
 every
 week
 on


Friday
 is
 um
 I
 I
 publish
 basically
 what


I
 read
 this
 week
 on
 a
 slack
 channel.
 So


it's
 not
 spamming
 the
 whole
 company.


It's
 only
 people
 who
 want
 to
 follow
 that


and
 uh
 which
 is
 quite
 a
 lot
 but
 it's
 I
 I


find
 it
 helpful
 because
 I
 read
 a
 lot
 of


news
 uh
 whether
 it's
 political
 news
 or


entertainment
 news
 or
 business
 news
 just


every
 day
 at least
 an
 hour
 of
 that.
 So,


so
 I
 basically
 collect
 not
 everything


that
 I've
 read
 but
 basically
 a
 bunch
 of


notable
 stories
 and
 then
 I
 share
 them.


What
 kind
 of
 things
 do
 you
 read?
 Um,
 I


mean
 a
 there
 there's
 a
 there's
 an
 uh
 uh


headlines
 u
 headlines
 uh
 newsletter
 that


I
 get
 uh
 from
 one
 person
 that
 gives
 me


like
 probably
 100
 headlines
 every
 single


day
 on
 different
 important
 topics.
 So


that's
 like
 my
 most
 succinct
 way
 to


absorb
 everything
 that's
 happening
 uh
 in


the
 world
 right
 now.
 Who
 is
 it
 called?


It's
 uh
 his
 name
 is
 Abe.
 Is
 it
 Abe


Burns?
 I
 forget.
 Right.
 I'll
 I I'll
 get


it
 back
 to
 I'll
 get
 back
 to
 you
 on
 that.


And
 uh
 but
 it's
 extremely
 useful
 and
 um


and
 then
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 read
 Wall
 Street


Journal
 uh
 you
 know
 all
 of
 the


publication
 Bloomberg,
 FD


uh
 New
 York
 Times
 etc.
 So
 I
 read
 all
 of


those.
 uh
 then
 I
 go
 through
 uh
 Apple


News
 because
 then
 you
 rope
 open
 a
 whole


bunch
 of
 other
 one
 it
 goes
 beyond


business
 right
 so
 it's
 more
 into
 like


general
 life
 etc
 and
 then
 I
 have
 lots
 of


different
 newsletters
 uh
 that
 I


subscribe
 to
 like
 strategery


etc
 Ben
 Thompson
 um
 you
 know
 and
 just


read
 all
 of
 that
 on
 topics
 that
 have


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 Warner
 right
 uh
 but


just
 to
 be
 generally
 smarter


if
 you
 were
 to
 distill
 it
 down
 what
 is


driving
 you
 each
 day
 when
 you
 work
 with


uh
 amazing
 creative
 force,
 you
 know,


artists
 and
 songwriters.
 And
 for
 me,
 the


favorite
 part
 of
 my
 job
 is
 meeting
 them.


Uh
 when
 you
 when
 you
 work
 with
 them,


what
 drives
 you
 is
 that
 you
 want
 to


figure
 out
 the
 best
 way
 that
 we
 can
 help


them
 unleash
 their
 art
 on
 the
 world.
 And


that's
 kind
 of
 fun,
 right?
 Because
 when


you
 see
 that
 happening
 and
 when
 you
 see


the
 blue
 flame
 then
 getting
 bigger
 and


you
 know
 until
 it's
 like
 really
 flaming


uh
 it's
 it's
 incredible
 and
 in
 order
 to


do
 that
 you
 you
 have
 to
 not
 sit
 still


and
 disrupt
 the
 company
 itself
 right


because
 the
 industry
 is
 changing
 and


that's
 also
 cool.
 So
 it's
 like
 for
 me


it's
 the
 it's


the
 constant
 evolution
 and
 the
 ability


to
 shape
 things
 for
 the
 future
 again
 you


know
 it's
 disruption
 it's
 uh
 yeah
 I


guess
 I
 in
 one
 word
 it's
 disruption


right
 because
 I
 think
 through
 disruption


you
 find
 opportunity
 it
 makes
 you


stronger
 smarter
 and
 you
 can't
 be
 afraid


of
 it
 and
 uh
 yeah
 I
 just
 don't
 like
 to
 s


sit
 still
 and
 so
 this
 job
 allows
 me
 to


do
 that
 and
 when
 you
 have
 to
 sit
 still


how
 do
 you
 relax
 I
 don't
 really
 by


reading
 news
 uh


But
 uh
 no,
 I
 like
 watching
 TV
 a
 lot


actually.
 Uh
 that's
 like
 my
 my
 favorite


way
 to
 completely
 disconnect.
 Um
 I'm


yeah
 voracious
 uh
 watcher
 of
 movies
 and


TV
 shows
 and
 a
 lot
 such
 as
 such
 as
 White


Lotus,
 uh
 Lionus,
 you
 know,
 I
 love
 a
 lot


of
 stuff
 that's
 on
 Paramount
 Plus,
 all


the
 Taylor
 Sheridan
 shows,
 you
 know,


Yellowstone
 and
 so
 I
 love
 that.
 uh
 you


know,
 Gilded
 Gilded
 Age
 on
 HBO
 was
 fun.


Uh
 but
 you
 know,
 obviously
 uh
 White


Lotus
 is
 great.
 And
 uh
 you
 know,
 um


Black
 Mirror
 on
 Netflix,
 amazing.
 Drops


of
 God
 on
 Apple
 TV
 Plus.
 Incredible


show.
 There's
 just
 so
 much.
 Uh
 The
 New


Look
 on
 on
 Apple,
 incredible.
 So
 there's


just
 there's
 just
 so
 much
 great
 stuff
 to


watch
 and
 um
 yeah,
 so
 that's
 that's


that's
 a
 way
 for
 me
 to
 completely


disconnect.
 We
 have
 10
 thou
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 uh
 young
 listeners
 uh
 to


this
 podcast.
 What
 what's
 your
 advice
 to


them?
 What
 is
 it
 that
 you
 have
 told
 your


two
 daughters?
 Sort
 of
 the
 same
 thing


that
 my
 dad
 told
 me
 which


was,
 you
 know,
 nobody
 will
 remember
 the


reasons
 why
 you
 failed.
 They'll
 just


remember
 your
 ranking
 or
 whatever
 the


result
 is.


uh
 you
 know
 just
 focus
 on
 driving


results
 and
 always
 always
 do
 stay
 two


steps
 ahead
 of
 your
 boss.
 That's
 I


learned
 it
 on
 one
 of
 my
 first
 jobs
 uh
 30


years
 ago
 uh
 when
 I
 was
 an
 assistant


where
 my
 boss
 told
 me
 be
 two
 steps
 ahead


of
 me
 and
 you'll
 be
 a
 winner.
 And
 you


know,
 of
 course,
 of
 course,
 there's
 two


steps
 means
 like,
 you
 know,
 there's
 a


tree,
 right,
 of
 decisions,
 but
 it


literally
 stays
 with
 me
 to
 this
 day.


That's
 how
 I
 think
 about
 things
 because


it
 allows
 you
 to
 iterate
 very
 quickly


with
 people
 when
 things
 are
 thought
 out


a
 little
 bit
 more.
 And
 it
 doesn't
 have


to
 be
 precise.
 How
 do
 you
 stay
 two
 steps


ahead
 of
 your
 boss?
 Anticipation.
 You


you
 anticipate
 what
 is
 the
 next
 question


after
 you've
 answered
 the
 first
 one,


right?
 And
 and
 you've
 answered
 it
 this


way
 or
 that
 way.
 And
 then
 so
 like
 you


got
 you
 know
 maybe
 four
 scenarios
 but


like
 you
 just
 kind
 of
 think
 it
 through


so
 you
 prepare
 it
 and
 and
 because
 of


that
 you
 kind
 of
 have
 much
 more
 dynamic


conversation
 versus
 oh
 I
 have
 to
 get


back
 to
 you
 and
 this
 and
 that.
 Like
 you


you
 you
 progress
 and
 you
 make
 faster


progress.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 really


really
 important.
 It
 stayed
 with
 me.


Honestly
 I
 learned
 that
 in
 my
 late
 20s


and
 it
 stayed
 with
 me
 to
 this
 day.
 And


uh
 and
 and
 you
 know
 the
 I
 say
 this
 to
 my


daughters.
 I
 mean
 this
 might
 not
 sound


that
 nice
 but
 when
 you
 say
 I'm
 doing
 my


best
 if
 the
 result
 isn't
 good
 it
 means


there's
 no
 more
 upside
 from


you
 right


so
 you
 know
 should
 think
 about
 that


before
 you
 say
 that
 right
 that
 you're


doing
 your
 best
 and
 um
 um
 you
 know
 so


it's
 uh
 there
 there
 are a
 few
 things


like
 this
 and
 and
 I
 think
 the
 you
 know


the
 immigrant
 mentality
 in
 me
 is
 I


always
 felt


because
 I
 have
 an
 accent.
 I
 was
 in
 an


accent.
 I
 always
 felt
 like
 it
 probably


holds
 me
 back
 somehow.
 So,
 I
 have
 to
 do


more
 in
 know,
 you
 know,
 I
 don't
 have


connections.
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 have
 to
 do


more
 than
 the
 Americans
 in
 order
 to
 get


the
 same.
 And
 uh
 when
 you
 do
 that,


somehow
 it
 sticks
 stays
 with
 you
 and


then
 you
 always
 just
 end
 up
 doing
 more


always.
 And
 um
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 good


to
 outrun
 the
 other
 people.
 Well,


Robert,
 all
 I
 can
 say
 is
 that
 it
 doesn't


sound
 like
 your
 immigrant
 accent
 has


held
 you
 back
 too
 much.
 Uh
 it's
 been


incredible
 talking
 to
 you.
 What
 a
 fun


company.
 What
 an
 incredible
 what
 an


incredible
 world
 and
 uh
 big
 thanks
 for


coloring
 our
 times
 with
 this
 incredible


music
 and
 for
 making
 life
 so
 much
 fun.


Thank
 you.
 We're
 really
 proud
 of
 the


company.
 We
 love
 what
 we
 do
 and
 uh
 you


know
 and
 we're
 disrupting
 ourselves
 and

 much
 uh
 you


know
 even
 much
 greater
 value

and
 songers
 and
 users
 all
 around
 the


world
 and
 being
 good
 partners
 to
 our


distribution
 partners.
