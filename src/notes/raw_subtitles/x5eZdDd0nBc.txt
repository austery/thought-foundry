Hello everyone, I am Anthony
Welcome to my channel
Today we continue to talk
Unconditionally accept this topic
Previous video
We discussed "What is unconditional love"
We say this kind of love
It is not simply affirming a person's existing abilities.
Or personality
It is the complexity and development of this person.
Even his incomprehensible contradictions,
Vulnerability and Shadow Acceptance
We discussed
Some common misconceptions about acceptance
The most important misunderstanding is
If we truly accept ourselves unconditionally
Does that mean
We are indulging our dark side
Will I become more depraved, selfish,
More destructive?
At the end of the last video
We pointed out
This worry often comes from a misunderstanding
That's what we misunderstand about people
Directly equivalent to human behavior
Some of the thoughts and emotions we have about ourselves
Feeling Fear
Because we subconsciously associate
If we really put these ideas into practice
That will lead to unbearable consequences.
Then this video
Let’s continue discussing
Behind this fear of accepting inner experience
What profound cultural patterns are hidden?
and defense mechanisms
Before the video starts, let me say
If you have any
Topics you want to discuss and consult with me
You can contact my email to make an appointment
So let's get back to today's topic.
We say
Individuals need to be responsible for their actions in the real world
Be responsible and bear the consequences
It is normal to be afraid of the consequences of reality.
However, in my inner world
Or in an agreed
A safe conversation space
People don’t need to be afraid of their own thoughts.
and guilty
You don't need to be responsible for this.
Ideas that seem "terrible" and "immoral"
It is precisely our deep need to explore
Intermediaries in the process of understanding the true self
They often do not point to realistic behavior
It's just some underlying inner conflict.
or the expression of unseen desire
What I want to emphasize here is
This is a pretty ideal situation.
We cannot ask others to
Providing us with this absolute security
A space for free speech
This is not an obligation in a relationship.
It should be purely based on voluntary
but
Even without considering external behavior and real consequences
Many people still feel
Only in my heart
Have certain thoughts and impulses
Such as aggressive, sexual
These things are immoral.
It needs to be condemned and criticized
Although I think
This concern
It exists in everyone to a greater or lesser extent.
But the Chinese in this regard
Indeed, we are facing a more repressive cultural structure.
This is reflected in
Chinese culture does not recognize subjective freedom at all
The inner world of an individual has never been considered an absolutely private,
Uncensorable space to view
On the contrary, Chinese culture has long
Has a moral overflow characteristic
That is, to judge ethically and legally
Not only on human behavior
Further expanded to people's words, thoughts
Even in emotional tendencies
This is typically reflected in the passage from The University.
that is:
"In ancient times, those who wished to make the virtues known to the world,
Govern the country first;
If you want to govern your country, you must first govern your family.
If you want to manage your family, you must first improve yourself.
If you want to improve yourself, you must first correct your mind.
If you want to straighten your heart, you must first be sincere in your intentions.
If you want to be sincere, you must first know
"To acquire knowledge lies in the investigation of things"
We can understand this sentence as
The sincerity of one's thoughts
It not only concerns his personal life, family situation
Even eventually it will determine the order of the world
This is actually quite an exaggeration.
and the slippery slope of absolutes
For example, The University says:
The so-called sincere intention
Don't deceive yourself...
Therefore, a gentleman must be careful when he is alone...
Zengzi said: "Ten eyes are watching, ten hands are pointing.
What are you talking about? "
that is
You have to be honest with every thought in your heart.
Stay alert
Even when alone
Also remember that there are countless people staring at you and pointing at you.
Although Confucianism emphasizes sincerity and self-monitoring
However, this standard of sincerity and supervision
It is not the result of one's own rational legislation.
It's all based on the group you belong to.
Based on the perspective of others
You can't doubt or deny.
This moral rationality
So this is not self-discipline
Heteronomy
Just Chinese culture
Does not acknowledge the existence of an independent self
Therefore, this kind of heteronomy seems to be no different from self-discipline.
This is also the shame of the Chinese
And one of the sources of extreme moral anxiety:
People do not have an inner space that is not prying and closed.
So even if your ideas never become reality
Feel fear and shame about it
Denial of the existence of an inner world independent of external reality
This will lead to a terrible consequence
That is, others can legally
Conduct moral judgment on the inner self of an individual
As
What we said in this video last September
Since the Han Dynasty
Spring and Autumn Judgment
Chinese society began to
An important judicial system
Judicial Officer
Of course, the emperor
They all have enormous discretion.
In the absence of explicit legal provisions
Or difficult cases
Judicial officers are not bound by the letter of the law
Flexibility in choosing applicable law
Pursuing so-called substantive justice
As stated in the Treatise on Salt and Iron:
"The Spring and Autumn Annals's approach to judicial administration is to judge the crime based on the heart.
Those who have good intentions and act in accordance with the law are exempted.
Those who commit the most evil acts and comply with the law shall be punished."
that is
Rulers have an obligation
To examine and judge people's inner world
If your intention is good
Even if you break the law
Can also be exempted from guilt
If your heart is bad
Even if it is legal, it should be punished
The good or bad of a person's heart
Most of the time
Only based on the motives of the accused,
The subjective speculation of conscience
There is a lot of room for flexibility
Under the harsh and ubiquitous moral pressure
Chinese culture advocates
It can only be a kind of self-complexity removed.
Undeveloped personality
As
What we said in this video on January 4th
Chinese culture has always had a strong tendency
It is to advocate no desire, no pursuit, no knowledge
I think a model personality is like a mirror.
Can be open and aboveboard
Many people will be simple-minded
Being free from desire is seen as a moral ideal
The so-called lack of desire leads to strength
Not too many desires and needs
There is no discrimination
The mind will be pure
Such a person
There is really nothing to hide from the public.
Everything he has can be opened at any time
Accepting the prying and monitoring of others
However
This is based on mass supervision
Or the imagined sincerity of mass supervision
Is it truly sincere?
If we associate it with the possibility of being condemned
Suppress and deny your own experience
So is this repression itself moral?
It's like saying
If you do good things and don't do bad things
Just to get a reward or avoid punishment
This behavior itself is not noble.
It can only be said to be a consideration of pros and cons
If I control my thoughts and actions
Just because I think others are watching me
Then this kind of self-discipline
It's just to make others look at you
The results after internalization
It is often based on guilt, shame and fear.
But the mainstream moral values ​​in Chinese society
Often this guilt and fear is glorified.
To this
Kant in "Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals"
There was an evaluation
That is to say, rewards and punishments are directly linked to morality.
This is more like a loss of virtue
and destroy all its sublimity
because
It places the causes of virtue and sin in the same category
And just teach us to calculate better
But it completely obliterated
The special difference between the two
This passage means that
True morality can only be based on free will
Rather than external rewards and punishments
Feelings of shame, fear, and guilt seem internal
Often mistaken for my inner conscience
But in the final analysis, it is still society,
Others and Authority
Results through cultural and institutional implantation
I don’t really understand or agree with these concepts.
It's just that I don't have the ability to reflect yet.
and the ability to choose
The result of being pre-educated by others
When we are in a
When you can’t see what you really need
We should first fight for freedom
That is
Free yourself from shame and guilt
Liberate
Live your experience to the fullest
So
Here comes a question
Why can't a person fully experience his or her own experience?
Is it not free?
When we say a person is "free"
This freedom
It doesn't just mean he has multiple options.
It does not just mean that he is not subject to external coercion.
A deeper meaning is:
He has an inner coherence, integration,
A self-structure capable of supporting contradictory experiences
Freedom is not something that can be said in fragments
"I want this" "I want that"
It means
A person can experience complex and even conflicting
Still have a consistent sense of self
He knows what he is doing
I also know who I am
The relationship between his thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
Even if it's not always consistent
At least they can talk to each other and understand each other.
As Sullivan writes in the article the illusion of personal individuality
What I think
How many relationships do we have?
How many selves are there?
Every self
Each corresponds to a different set of experiences, memories,
Attitude and impulse
Some relationships are more important
For example, the relationship with parents
Then the corresponding self
Our core self
To measure a person's mental health
Very important standard
It is to see the difference between the different feelings of his various selves.
Can we communicate and connect?
If a person's many experiences
Not accepted and integrated by the primary personality
Then these experiences will be relegated to the margins.
Each self is separated and disconnected from the others.
The individual falls into a state of dissociation
This is of course the most intrinsic kind of unfreedom.
For example, a person is usually very gentle
But after getting drunk
Just say something very radical and offensive
After sobering up, he denied everything.
He even said he didn't remember what he said at all.
He can't control his own spiritual world.
Contents brought out by alcohol
Often real but repressed emotions
It's just that his main personality, when he's awake,
Can't admit to accommodating them
certainly
Living in the world
We all inevitably experience dissociation.
For example, when we are overwhelmed by an emotion
We will temporarily
Disconnect from the primary self
Denying and cutting off these feelings and experiences
But this dissociation is usually restored afterwards.
The person involved can also recall these things
More severe dissociation is persistent
And it is difficult for the parties to notice
For example, a boy
Growing up in a tense family environment
Father is strong and violent
The mother is weak and evasive.
Always deal with conflicts by compromising
So this boy was extremely sensitive and observed
The oppressive and aggressive nature of my father
The damage caused
He swore to himself
“I will never be like my father”
So he strongly identified with his mother.
And developed a gentle,
A reasonable self-image
This recognition
Originally a strategy to cope with existential anxiety
is an attachment to the “safer side” in a conflict situation
But it slowly develops
It has become the core pillar of the client's self-image.
turn out
He can't admit the aggressive part of himself.
The experience of anger
He separated this part
And think that any aggression is dangerous,
Dirty
He needs to hold on to his gentleness
As a source of self-esteem
Even if you are seriously offended in a relationship
It is also difficult to express anger
I can only blame myself and waste my energy silently
He is used to understanding others as an obligation
Impose on oneself
Believe that you have an unconditional responsibility to be considerate of others
If this is not done
I seem to have become a bad person like my father.
However
This aggression and anger doesn't really go away
It may manifest itself in another form
For example, the parties may suddenly explode at certain moments.
But he later thought it wasn't me
For example
The person concerned is angry at someone who can express his anger
Unspeakable hostility
But unable to realize
This is actually a projection of the repressed part of oneself.
result
The parties subjectively believe
Expressing aggression is necessarily rude and immoral
Moderation means civilization and rationality
However, this moral view is actually quite rigid
and absolute
It is not based on real identity
It is the result of splitting off incompatible experiences.
A more serious dissociative state is multiple personalities.
For example, I have a female friend
She has a severe dissociative disorder.
An emotionally avoidant ex
When she pursued this ex-boyfriend
The man was very happy
Gave the other party a lot of hints and responses
However, as the relationship between the two sides becomes closer
This man's past traumatic experiences with intimate relationships
Triggered
Then one day he became a different person.
Accusing girls of constantly approaching themselves
It's violating your boundaries.
When the girls pointed out
The man also cooperated and participated in the ambiguous interaction
This man said he couldn't help himself.
Just to take care of each other
That's not his real self.
The man insisted that he had no emotional investment
Instead, they keep emphasizing that everything is the other party's responsibility.
I have never been moved from beginning to end
Completely independent
But in fact
The more inconsistent and intense his reactions are,
The more it explains
He was actually touched deep down.
This heart-moving experience
It will make him feel that he needs something from the other person.
This would bring back his old fears of attachment.
Because of his real experience and traumatic experience
Isolated from each other and unable to integrate
He will at some point
It's like a changed personality
Not remembering or being able to acknowledge previous involvement
That's it.
Someone might ask
How should one reduce dissociation?
Promote integration?
As we said before
A person's experience of dissociating himself
Often because
Those experiences
Being seen as dangerous by important relationships,
Terrible
For survival and safety
I had to separate that part of the experience.
So the solution is to
Finding a Receptive Relationship
To the greatest extent possible
Allowing the experience of dissociation to emerge
Strive for full and complete self-acceptance
This is exactly where morality begins
On the other hand
If a person
They are unable to face and integrate the dark side of their hearts.
Such as jealousy, anger, possessiveness, etc.
Unable to face the real self
On the surface he may appear
Very rational and restrained
But this morality
It is often just the result of repression and avoidance.
It's actually quite unstable.
They are often sanctimonious.
Many moral role models in Chinese history
They are all quite twisted in personality.
They change the environment at a critical moment.
It will suddenly turn black
That's because
They haven't really integrated and accepted
Dark energy within
at the same time
Because he himself denies his dark side
So when others express pain, confusion, and contradiction
His first reaction is often
Judging others from a moral high ground
He felt that he was upright and spotless.
As a result, his "sense of morality"
It often becomes a tool to attack others.
Chinese culture often admires this type of person:
It means hating evil and speaking out.
Based only on a simple and naive view of good and evil
You can judge people's hearts
The complexity of people
Adopting an extremely simple and crude attitude
But this can only be said to be a rather primitive morality.
That’s all for today’s video.
We will discuss this topic later.
