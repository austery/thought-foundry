- I want you to listen to these two sounds
and decide which is higher.
So this is sound A.
(sample sound buzzing)
And this is sound B.
(sample sound buzzing)
Okay, so to me, sound A is clearly higher,
but that's strange
because sound A was just
a 100 hertz sine wave.
Sound B had that same 100 hertz frequency,
but also 150 hertz and 200 hertz.
So we added higher frequencies,
but the sound was lower.
How does that work?
I think there's this idea that
what our ears do is simply
detect the frequency
of vibrations in our
environment that are between
20 hertz and 20,000 hertz.
But there is so much more
to hearing than that.
And in this video, we're
gonna go through a series
of audio illusions that
illustrate how our sense
of hearing actually works.
Most of these effects will work on a phone
or laptop speakers, but if you
have headphones handy, well,
I'd recommend putting them
on for the full experience.
It's like a whole body
instrument, isn't it?
- Absolutely yeah, yeah.
- This is the Sydney Town Hall pipe organ.
When it was built in 1890,
it was the largest organ in the world.
Something I didn't realize about organs is
that they were meant to
sound like many different
instruments playing together.
- Organs are sort of a
one person orchestra.
Very flutie, right?
- Yeah.
- You can tell.
Compare that to a trumpet.
Oboe sound.
So you can hear all these
orchestral sounds on the organ.
We could get inside the instrument too.
- Should we go look?
- Let's have a look. Yeah.
- Okay.
- For each instrument,
there are a series of pipes
in the organ which play all the different
notes for that instrument.
- I mean, there are 8,000
pipes in this organ.
- 8,000?
- 8,000, yeah.
- Why do you need that many?
- To create all the different
sounds of the orchestra.
- What you see on the outside
is just a tiny fraction
of the organ itself.
Whoa look at all these.
They're all hidden in here.
- [Titus] They are, yeah.
And some are wooden, some are metal.
Some have resonators at the bottom of them
to create the more reedy
sounds, the brassy sounds.
But then these wooden ones are more
of the deep flutie sounds as well.
- This is like what a keyboard?
- It's a keyboard. Yeah, that's right.
A keyboard layout of pipes.
- Very nice you position yourself well...
- When two pipes of the
same length vibrate,
they both play the same note.
That's because they're both
producing the same fundamental
frequency that is the lowest
and usually highest amplitude
vibration they produce.
But if the pipes are made
of different materials,
they will sound different.
So you can tell they are
different instruments,
and that's because each
one produces a distinct set
of higher frequencies called overtones.
They're not as loud as the fundamental,
and we don't hear them as distinct tones,
but they affect the quality
of the sound called timbre.
It's how you can tell apart a trumpet
from say a flute.
They have overtones of
different frequencies
and relative amplitudes.
For a lot of instruments,
the most common overtones
are integer multiples
of the fundamental frequency.
These are known as harmonics.
- If this was your fundamental note,
the notes that you're gonna
be hearing with it would be...
So all of those notes are
within that fundamental note.
- Now, harmonics can be
useful when you're trying
to play really low notes.
The Sydney Town Hall pipe organ is one
of only two in the world
that has a 64 foot long pipe.
- It's actually so large that it has
to be folded over itself.
- Where is the 64? Can we see it?
- You've got the grand question
that I don't know.
I know it's somewhere here.
- Like that's a really big
chunk of wood right here.
- Oh, yeah.
- Could that be it?
This pipe is used to produce
a frequency of 8 hertz.
- When you get to that
level, it's more something
that you feel rather than
something that you hear.
- For sure.
The lowest note most big
pipe organs can play is
16 hertz, which is just at
the limit of human hearing.
But even this requires a 32
foot pipe, which is too big
or expensive for many organs.
Do you know where the 32 footers are?
- Well...
- They're ones out the front?
- They're the ones that
you see at the front.
That one.
- That's the 32 footer.
- Yeah.
- So that's nearly 10 meters.
- Nearly 10 meters. Yeah.
It's pretty scary to think about
from the top of it actually.
- In 18th century Europe,
Georg Joseph Vogler
was a popular organist.
He wanted to tour the continent,
but that would require building
a compact portable organ
that he could take with him on the road.
And we obviously couldn't haul
around the huge 32 foot pipe
required to produce 16 hertz.
So how could he still
create the low frequencies
that make the organ so powerful?
Well, Vogler realized that
if he played the harmonics
of 16 hertz using shorter pipes,
your brain would hear
this missing fundamental.
Can we try the trick
and see if it sounds?
- Yeah, sure.
The fifth is that sort of
most common fundamental,
which you're gonna hear
to get the low sound,
but basically the quint
gets used with a 16 foot
and it creates the lower resultant tone.
So that's just the 16 metal.
- It's so funny because you add it
and I do not hear it going up.
You're playing a fifth above.
- Yes
- But I'm hearing it go down.
Like you just pull that out and I'm like,
oh yeah, the note dropped.
- That's the trick. Yeah.
- With the two sounds I
played at the beginning,
the first was a pure 100 hertz.
(sample sound buzzing)
But the second sound was made up
of the harmonics of 50 hertz.
(sample sound buzzing)
So you actually heard this
fundamental frequency,
even though it wasn't there.
That's how higher frequencies
together can sound lower than
low frequencies if they are
harmonics of a low fundamental.
Now, this might not be
as weird as it seems.
If you look at the wave
form of the harmonics,
you find that adding
the higher frequencies
changes the period of the sound.
It makes the period longer so
that it's actually the same
as the missing fundamental.
- If you kind of recreate some
of those harmonic pitches,
you're actually gonna bring
out more bass in the sound.
- So, the idea of like you
could play the harmonics
and hear the fundamental
even if you're not
playing the fundamental.
- That's right. Yeah.
- So different frequency sounds can
combine to make notes that aren't there,
but they can also do
something, even stranger.
- Hello, it's me, Mario.
- In Super Mario 64, there's a staircase
that seems to go on forever.
Players can't level up until
they collect enough coins.
Now listen carefully to the music.
The scale sounds like
it keeps going up and up
and up, just like the endless staircase.
This is the Shepard tone illusion,
and here's a Shepard Glissando on its own.
(music escalating)
An ever increasing tone
should be impossible
because we can't hear anything
beyond the 20,000 hertz limit,
and yet this sound keeps
going, always ascending.
The trick is a Shepard
tone isn't just one note.
There are multiple
frequencies being played,
all separated by octaves.
All of these frequencies are increasing,
but as they do, their volumes change.
So the high notes get quieter,
and the low notes get louder.
High notes soon fade out, and
new low notes are faded in.
This gives the illusion
of an ever rising pitch,
like the audio version
of a barbershop pole.
Shepard tones can also evoke emotional
or physical responses in some listeners.
A 2016 study found that
after listening to Shepard tones,
participants reported feeling nervous,
anxious, and disturbed.
Perhaps that's why during
an intense bombing scene
in the film, "Dunkirk"
Shepard tones feature
in the accompanying score.
Hopefully this won't make you uneasy,
but I want you to try to figure
out which well-known tune,
this is, all of the notes
have been kept the same,
but they've been mixed up
into different octaves.
(sound beeping)
Did you recognize the song?
Well, here is the unscrambled melody.
(sound beeping)
But now that you've heard that,
can you follow the scrambled version?
(sound beeping)
To me, it's fascinating
how the second time
I heard the scrambled melody,
the tune seemed obvious,
which is very different from
how it sounded the first time.
Our brains can find patterns
in random sounds too.
This is the phantom word illusion created
by Dr. Diana Deutsch.
Listen to this audio
and try to figure out
which words are being said.
You can put what you
heard in the comments.
When one speaker plays a word,
the second speaker plays a different word
at the same time.
According to Dr. Deutsch,
because the signals are mixed
in the air before they reach your ears,
you're given a pile of sounds
to choose from, so you can
create words in your mind.
A lot of what we hear depends
not on the frequencies
of sound, but on how
our brains process them.
Dr. Deutsch noticed that when
she played this illusion near
exam week, students reported
hearing words like, "No brain,"
"I'm tired," or "No time."
And we can actually
prime the brain to hear
what we want it to hear.
For example, using text.
Take the case of this crowd chanting.
(crowd chanting)
You're primed to hear the lyrics you see.
These are called Mondegreens,
after a misheard poem
in which there's a line,
"They have slain the Earl Amurray
and Lady Mondegreen."
Except in the real poem,
the Earl dies alone
and his killers actually
laid him on the green.
Sometimes mondegreens happen
when sounds are divided
logically, but incorrectly,
such as hearing pullet surprise
instead of Pulitzer Prize.
Language familiarity would help you hear
the correct one from the start.
So while UK football fans
might hear the common chant
that is embarrassing.
- [Crowd] That is embarrassing.
- An American football fan might not.
What's even more amazing is
how subtle visual cues
can affect what we hear.
What am I saying in this clip?
If you heard the word bear,
that's because that's what I was saying.
But what am I saying in this clip?
Now I bet you heard fair,
but if you play back both
those clips without looking,
you'll find it's the exact same audio.
All we changed was the mouth movement,
and I can prove it to you
by playing those two
clips at the same time.
And what you hear will
change depending on which
clip you focus on.
So what we see affects what we hear.
And the reverse is also true.
In this illusion if no sound is played,
it looks like the two circles are passing
through each other, but at
a sound when they intersect
(balls dashing)
and immediately it seems like
they're bouncing off each other.
(balls dashing)
What we see and hear are
intrinsically linked.
Because in the real world,
one sense can reliably inform the other.
But what if there are
no visual cues to go on?
In the 1950s, air traffic
controllers were communicating
with multiple pilots
simultaneously in the same room.
Unfortunately, messages from all
of the pilots would play
from a single loudspeaker,
and the overlapping audio
made it really difficult
to pick out just one voice.
So researchers started
looking into the so-called
cocktail party effect,
because this problem resembled
focusing on a single
voice in a noisy room.
Most of us can do this with
little effort, but how?
It's kind of like taking the recording
of the entire party and pulling out
a particular voices waveform.
The sound waves interfere with each other
before reaching your ears.
So this should be a difficult task.
In this recording, try
to find the voice talking
about a flight in this crowd.
(crowd talking)
I find that really hard,
but if you hear the voice
first, then the rest
of the conversation is easier to follow,
(crowd talking)
This is much easier
because you can predict
what words will come next based on context
and language structure.
The second way we can focus
on one voice is by identifying
where the sound is coming from.
Listen again, but this
time focus on the pilot
played in your left ear.
(crowd talking)
In a cocktail party, you
can focus on your friend
by ignoring sounds that
come from other locations.
Once researchers realized
this, they advocated
that different pilots be broadcast
through different speakers,
spread out throughout the control room.
This allowed air traffic controllers
to more successfully
tune in to their pilot.
But how do we actually
locate the source of a sound?
Well, I'm gonna put on this blindfold
and ask my wife to walk around me
and clap in different locations,
and I am going to try to point
to the location of the sound.
So let's give it a try.
Normally you can pinpoint a sound
to within a degree or two.
And there are actually four different cues
that help me identify the
location of the sound.
How is it?
The first is volume.
A sound on my right will
be louder in my right ear.
My head sort of casts a sound
shadow over my left ear.
And the second cue is that
this shadow attenuates
higher frequencies more
than low frequencies.
It's kinda like when your
neighbor is having a party.
You can't really hear the high
frequencies like the lyrics,
but you can hear the bass
because low frequencies
are less attenuated
by distance and obstacles.
The third is time delay.
It takes a sound half a
millisecond to cross your head,
so sound will usually arrive
at one ear before the other.
Listen to a beep on your left.
(sound beeping)
and then on your right.
(sound beeping)
Now, as the delay between
those two beeps is shortened,
(ound beeping)
it's less of an echo
and more just one sound
that's really on your left.
(sound beeping)
The fourth cue we use
to identify the source
of a sound is at what
point in the wave cycle
the sound arrives at each
ear or the phase of the wave.
Is it arriving at a peak or a trough?
The phase of the wave at one
ear will typically be different
than the phase at the other ear.
Now you run into a bit of trouble
when the sound is either directly in front
or behind you or on any
point in a vertical plane
that passes through the
middle of your head.
And that's because the
distance from the sound to both
of your ears is the same.
And therefore, those four
cues aren't very useful.
Owls solve this issue
with asymmetrical ears.
Their left ear is actually lower on their
head than their right ear.
So sounds from below are
louder in their lower left ear.
Humans typically have symmetric ears,
but their shapes are important.
This is where the outer
part of your ear comes in.
I mean, what we'd normally
just refer to as the ear.
Technically this is called the pinna.
Depending on the location
and the frequency of sound,
it will bounce off these ridges
and bumps on your ear
and end up inside your ear
actually going into the eardrum.
And those reflections will actually change
some frequencies differently than others
depending on the location.
Scientists placed tiny microphones
inside volunteer's ears to measure this.
They could see, for example,
that a 6,000 hertz sound located
above you might be
amplified by 10 decibels,
but that same sound below
you would be attenuated
by 10 decibels.
These figures depend on the unique bumps
and ridges of cartilage in your ear.
So each person's ears have
a unique response curve
to different frequencies
at different locations.
And over the course of our lives,
our brains learn the way
different frequencies reflect off
our ears, and we use that information
to identify the source of the sound.
Now, every person has
a unique pinna shape.
So what if our ears changed?
In a 1998 study,
researchers placed small
molds into the ears of a group
of participants changing
the shape of their pinnas.
Here's one subject's data.
The rigid background grid represents
where sounds were actually played.
The dots are the subject's guesses,
and the darker warped grid is
the averages of those guesses.
Before the study, they were
fairly good at locating sounds,
but after changing their pinna shape,
they were downright terrible.
Over a series of days and
weeks with their new pinnas,
the participants all adjusted
and became better at locating sound.
So it is something your
brain can adapt to.
Thankfully, after the molds were removed,
participants had no trouble reverting back
to their original ears.
Pinna shape is so key to an
immersive sound experience
in virtual reality that
companies like Apple
and Sony actually scan your ears
to create personalized spatial audio.
And for a long time, people
have been trying to harness
and amplify our ability to locate sounds.
In 1880, professor Alfred
Mayer presented a device
called a topophone to
locate ships in the fog.
It was made from two
adjustable hearing cones.
By changing the distance
and angle between them,
sailors could narrow down the
direction of a ship's foghorn.
Unfortunately, they weren't very useful
because sound waves interact with fog.
But then during World War I
locating bombing planes on
approach was of central importance.
So armies developed special
equipment called sound mirrors
to amplify sound.
In Britain, sound mirror
stations coordinated together
to locate an enemy up to
15 minutes in advance.
But as planes became faster,
sound mirrors couldn't
detect them early enough,
and they were eventually abandoned
after the invention of radar.
But even though the
technology became obsolete,
the system was not.
The radar team used the
coordinating station's idea
that was first developed from
the Sound Mirror program.
Linked radar stations
were a critical defense
in the Battle of Britain.
This is the Vox Angelica on
the Sydney Town Hall Organ.
When two pipes are slightly out of tune,
there's this pulsing effect to the sound.
You can hear that in a more pronounced way
if I play pure tones.
Here is a pure 261 hertz sine wave.
(sound beeping)
And a pure 263 hertz sine wave.
(sound beeping)
When both of these tones
play, those compression
and refraction waves
interfere with each other.
Sometimes the peaks line up
to produce a louder sound,
and when a peak lines up with
a trough, they cancel out.
Because these frequencies
are separated by two hertz,
you hear two louder pulses every second.
This is known as beating.
(sound buzzing)
Now the beats are really clear,
and this makes sense when the two waves
are interfering in the air.
But what happens if a 261
hertz tone is played in one ear
and a 263 hertz tone
is played in the other?
(sound beeping)
What did you hear?
Well, the tones never
had a chance to interact,
but you can still hear
some subtle beating.
Your brain is firing
at a rate corresponding
to the phase difference
causing the beat perception.
When your brain mixes
these frequencies together,
it's called Binaural Beats.
(sound beeping)
And maybe you've already
heard of Binaural Beats
as a quick search of YouTube shows
that some people claim they
can improve focus or memory.
But a 2023 review was inconclusive
and emphasized the need
for more standardized testing methods.
Audio illusions aren't
a sign that our sense
of hearing is faulty.
I mean, the world is a messy, noisy place,
and our brains have
developed complex methods
to deal with ambiguity.
You fill in the gaps
with your past experiences
or expectations.
Without your brain making these
subconscious adjustments,
a cocktail party would always
just sound like a total mess.
Audio illusions show us where
our perception goes wrong,
but the system as a whole is pretty good
at getting to the truth.
(static hissing)
Now, illusions remind us
that we can't always take
the world at face value.
And while our unconscious minds
might fill in the gaps from
time to time, it's our
critical thinking skills
that do the heavy lifting of
separating fact from fiction.
