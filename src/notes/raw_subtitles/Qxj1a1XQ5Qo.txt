Germany,
 the
 automotive
 powerhouse,
 the


engineering
 marvel
 of
 Europe,
 is


bleeding
 tech
 talent
 at
 an
 alarming


rate.
 While
 social
 media
 is
 focused
 on


US
 tech
 layoffs,
 Germany
 has
 lost
 over


12,000
 jobs
 in
 2024
 alone.
 The
 economic


engine
 of
 Europe
 is
 stalling
 with


manufacturing
 in
 decline
 for
 two


consecutive
 years.
 So,
 what's
 happening?


Why
 is
 talent
 fleeing
 east
 and
 south?


And
 most
 importantly,
 what
 does
 this


mean
 for
 tech
 careers
 today?
 This
 video


series
 is
 for
 tech
 professionals
 already


living
 and
 working
 in
 the
 US,
 Canada,


the
 UK,
 or
 the
 European
 Union.
 If
 you're


based
 outside
 these
 regions
 or
 in
 an


outsourcing
 heavy
 market,
 the
 data
 in


this
 video
 will
 not
 apply
 to
 your


situation.
 I
 do
 not
 cover
 immigration,


international
 job
 hunting,
 or
 topics


like
 how
 to
 break
 into
 tech
 without
 a


college
 degree.
 If
 that's
 what
 you're


here
 for,
 this
 probably
 isn't
 the
 right


channel,
 and
 that's
 okay.
 But
 if
 you
 are


operating
 within
 these
 markets,
 keep


watching.
 There's
 a
 lot
 ahead
 for


various
 seniority
 levels
 and
 career


tracks
 in
 tech.
 This
 is
 episode
 6
 of
 my


video
 series,
 Where
 to
 Run,
 where
 I


explore
 the
 smartest
 places
 for
 mid
 to


senior
 tech
 workers
 to
 rebuild
 post


layoffs
 and
 postpandemic.
 And
 on
 today's


episode,
 we've
 got
 Deutseland.
 Before
 we


start,
 please
 give
 us
 a
 thumbs
 up.
 We're


working
 very
 hard
 to
 improve
 with
 every


episode
 and
 deliver
 realistic
 and


high-quality
 content
 on
 the
 post
 layoff


postcoid
 tech
 landscape
 across
 the


world.
 Tech
 scene
 and
 culture.
 Germany's


tech
 industry
 has
 been
 among
 top
 two


most
 affected
 in
 Europe
 by
 post-pandemic


turbulence
 and
 a
 way
 of
 layoffs
 over
 the


past
 3
 years.
 Prior
 to
 COVID,
 Germany


had
 emerged
 as
 a
 major
 tech
 hub
 in


Europe,
 the
 largest
 one
 outside
 of
 the


UK
 with
 an
 abundance
 of
 startups
 and


traditional
 firms
 with
 significant
 tech


labs
 inside
 those
 firms.
 Nevertheless,


since
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 pandemic,


with
 the
 effects
 of
 subsequent
 mass


layoffs,
 investment
 priorities
 and


investment
 volume
 in
 Germany
 has
 shifted


and
 changes
 in
 the
 work
 culture
 reshaped


the
 tech
 ecosystem
 very
 significantly.


More
 than
 12,000
 tech
 jobs
 were
 cut
 in


2024
 alone,
 which
 is
 definitely
 far
 from


the
 US
 figure,
 which
 is
 150k,
 but
 still


very
 significant
 for
 Europe.
 Major


German
 employers
 have
 each
 laid
 off


thousands
 of
 workers
 in
 response
 to


falling
 profits
 and
 a
 challenging


post-pandemic
 economic
 landscape.
 The


German
 manufacturing
 PMI
 was
 48.4
 in


April
 2025,
 which
 is
 still
 below
 the
 50


mark
 that
 signals
 expansion.
 The
 country


had
 two
 consecutive
 years
 of
 negative


economic
 growth
 with
 GDP
 contracting.


Now,
 why
 is
 all
 of
 this
 manufacturing


data
 important
 in
 the
 context
 of
 Germany


even
 though
 we
 talk
 about
 tech?
 This
 is


important
 because
 the
 manufacturing


share
 of
 Germany's
 GDP
 is
 much
 larger


than
 that
 of
 any
 other
 European
 country.


And
 if
 Germany
 has
 issues
 with


manufacturing,
 it
 has
 a
 ripple
 effect
 on


everything
 else.
 German
 industrial
 and


automotive
 giants
 make
 up
 the
 backbone


of
 Europe's
 biggest
 economy
 and
 all
 of


them
 struggle
 to
 cope
 with
 macroeconomic


headwinds
 caused
 by
 the
 rising
 energy


prices
 and
 falling
 external
 demand.


Germany
 is
 a
 highly
 export
 dependent


economy.
 Now
 back
 to
 tech.
 A
 few
 data


points
 on
 some
 well-known
 European
 tech


employers.
 Clara,
 a
 notable
 Swedish


unicorn
 with
 a
 major
 office
 in
 Berlin,


reduced
 its
 global
 workforce
 by
 40%


between
 2022
 and
 2025.
 The
 company
 does


not
 disclose
 Germany
 specific
 numbers,


but
 Berlin
 tech
 roles
 were
 particularly


affected
 because
 Clarus
 shifted
 more


tech
 operations
 to
 lowercost
 countries.


There
 are
 multiple
 threads
 on
 Reddit
 and


Blind
 with
 internal
 people
 reporting


approximate
 calculations,
 but
 I
 haven't


been
 able
 to
 find
 a
 reliable
 number.


Wayfair
 eliminated
 approximately
 730


jobs
 in
 January
 2025
 as
 it
 exited
 the


German
 market
 completely
 and
 all
 local


roles
 were
 either
 cut
 or
 relocated.


Revolute
 implemented
 a
 hiring
 freeze
 in


Berlin
 in
 2024
 and
 offered
 existing


staff
 to
 relocate
 to
 Spain,
 Portugal
 or


Poland.
 The
 company's
 Berlin
 tech
 team


size
 is
 not
 publicly
 disclosed,
 but


internal
 employees
 report
 a
 dramatic


reduction.
 So
 the
 hiring
 freeze
 and
 the


relocation
 offers
 indicate
 a
 substantial


downsizing
 of
 the
 Revolute's
 German
 tech


operation.
 US
 tech
 giants
 have


significantly
 reduced
 or
 paused
 hiring


in
 Berlin
 for
 2024
 and
 2025.
 So
 there
 is


a
 pattern
 where
 tech
 staff
 is
 shifted


either
 to
 Eastern
 or
 Southern
 Europe,


Poland,
 Hungary,
 Spain,
 Portugal,


Ukraine
 and
 the
 past
 but
 a
 lot
 less


favored
 now
 due
 to
 the
 ongoing
 war.
 If


it's
 outside
 of
 Europe,
 the
 most
 popular


choice
 is
 India.
 Now,
 under
 the
 Sweden


Denmark
 video,
 there
 were
 a
 bunch
 of


comments
 from
 people
 saying
 that
 the


Swedish
 tech
 market
 is
 absolutely


terrible
 and
 that
 there
 are
 no
 jobs.
 And


I
 often
 respond
 to
 them
 saying
 that
 this


is
 not
 specific
 to
 Denmark
 or
 Sweden.


It's
 the
 exact
 same
 thing
 in
 Canada
 and


the
 US
 and
 pretty
 much
 any
 other
 G7


country.
 And
 the
 bigger
 the
 series
 gets,


the
 more
 you'll
 see
 that
 this
 is
 a


pattern
 because
 yes,
 the
 tech
 market
 is


bad
 everywhere.
 I've
 been
 seeing
 the


exact
 same
 trend
 in
 Canada
 for
 several


years
 now
 where
 entire
 departments
 of


devs
 and
 QAs
 are
 being
 outsourced.
 It's


always
 the
 devs
 and
 QAs
 first
 that
 get


outsourced
 then
 designers
 and
 sometimes


even
 PMs.
 PMs
 are
 rarely
 outsourced


simply
 because
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 job


requires
 you
 to
 have
 a
 very
 good
 grip
 of


the
 market
 and
 you
 have
 to
 understand


the
 conditions,
 the
 usage
 patterns,
 the


behavior
 of
 the
 market
 that
 you
 operate


in.
 And
 when
 you
 live
 outside
 of
 the


market
 that
 you
 work
 in
 or
 that
 your


product
 is
 in,
 it's
 really
 hard
 to


maintain
 that
 level
 of
 awareness


required
 for
 the
 job.
 But
 even
 PMS
 are


being
 outsourced.
 As
 I
 was
 doing


research
 for
 this
 video,
 I
 spent
 quite
 a


bit
 of
 time
 looking
 into
 why
 Germany
 got


affected
 so
 much.
 So
 here
 is
 the
 picture


that
 I'm
 able
 to
 paint
 after
 reading


tens
 of
 reports
 and
 LinkedIn
 posts
 and


research
 studies
 and
 Reddit
 and
 blind


threads
 posted
 by
 those
 people
 who
 got


affected
 and
 those
 who
 stayed.
 So,
 if


there's
 anything
 I'm
 missing,
 please


post
 in
 the
 comments.
 I
 do
 want
 this


series
 to
 be
 as
 detailed
 and
 as


objective
 as
 possible.
 So,
 reason
 number


one,
 high
 cost
 structure
 and
 labor
 laws.


Germany
 historically
 has
 had
 very
 strict


labor
 protection
 laws
 and
 relatively


high
 wage
 expectations.
 And
 that
 makes


it
 very
 expensive
 for
 companies
 to


maintain
 large
 local
 tech
 teams,


especially
 compared
 to
 lowerc
 cost


European
 destinations.
 As
 remote
 work


became
 normalized
 post
 pandemic,


companies
 realized
 that
 they
 can
 hire


the
 exact
 same
 quality
 of
 talent
 or


similar
 quality
 of
 talent
 in
 countries


like
 Poland,
 Hungary,
 Spain,
 and


Portugal.
 And
 this
 combined
 with
 a
 large


number
 of
 Eastern
 Europeans
 migrating


around
 Western
 Europe
 as
 a
 result
 of
 the


war,
 companies
 are
 now
 able
 to
 hire
 very


high
 quality
 talent
 at
 a
 significantly


lower
 cost,
 prompting
 a
 shift
 of
 roles


outside
 of
 Germany.
 Reason
 number
 two,


salary
 expectations
 and
 the
 cost
 of


living.
 The
 rising
 cost
 of
 living
 in


Germany,
 especially
 in
 high-cost
 cities


like
 Munich,
 often
 drives
 tech


professionals
 to
 seek
 very
 high
 and


competitive
 compensation.
 But
 many
 tech


companies,
 especially
 startups,
 simply


cannot
 afford
 it.
 They
 cannot
 meet
 those


expectations
 due
 to
 budget
 constraints,


especially
 in
 a
 volatile
 economic


climate.
 on
 top
 of
 this
 at
 the
 tariff


war
 when
 God
 knows
 how
 that's
 going
 to


end.
 So
 most
 companies
 simply
 cannot


afford
 having
 their
 teams
 in
 Germany.


Reason
 number
 three,
 regulatory
 and


policy
 uncertainty.
 Many
 tech
 companies


site
 Germany's
 increasingly


unpredictable
 regulatory
 and
 tax


environment
 as
 a
 deterrent.
 Rapidly


introduced
 regulations
 such
 as
 the


supply
 chain
 act
 and
 complex
 bureaucracy


that
 Germany
 is
 known
 for
 make
 it
 less


attractive
 for
 tech
 investment
 and


expansion
 compared
 to
 more
 agile


European
 markets.
 Reason
 number
 four,


shift
 in
 skill
 demand.
 The
 types
 of


skills
 that
 German
 tech
 companies
 are


looking
 for
 have
 evolved.
 Emerging
 tech


such
 as
 machine
 learning,
 data
 science,


IoT,
 blockchain
 are
 in
 demand.
 Job


seekers
 whose
 expertise
 does
 not
 align


with
 high
 demand
 areas
 find
 it
 harder
 to


land
 offers
 simply
 because
 a
 lot
 of


traditional
 programming
 roles
 are
 being


actively
 outsourced.
 Now,
 a
 quick


reference
 to
 my
 previous
 Sweden
 and


Denmark
 video
 because
 there
 were
 a
 bunch


of
 people
 in
 the
 comments
 saying
 how


incredibly
 terrible
 the
 Swedish
 tech


market
 is
 and
 that
 there
 are
 no
 jobs.
 In


the
 interest
 of
 being
 fair,
 here
 is
 the


comparison
 of
 the
 layoff
 impact,
 just


the
 layoff
 impact
 between
 Sweden
 and


Germany.
 Starting
 with
 Germany.
 Germany


alongside
 the
 UK
 has
 become
 one
 of


Europe's
 hardest
 hit
 countries
 for
 tech


layoffs
 since
 2022.
 Between
 12
 and


19,000
 jobs
 were
 lost.
 This
 is
 the


highest
 number
 in
 Europe
 after
 the
 US.


Layoffs
 have
 been
 persistent
 across


startups
 and
 large
 tech
 firms
 with
 many


companies
 also
 offshoring
 roles
 to


lowercost
 countries.
 This
 trend
 is


expected
 to
 continue
 with
 one
 in
 three


German
 companies
 planning
 further
 job


cuts
 in
 2025.
 The
 German
 tech
 workforce


faces
 increased
 job
 insecurity
 and
 the


sector's
 recovery
 has
 been
 hampered
 by


economic
 stagnation
 as
 well
 as


regulatory
 hurdles
 and
 a
 shift
 of
 jobs


abroad.
 Now,
 let's
 look
 at
 Sweden.


Sweden's
 experienced
 a
 very
 sharp
 spike


in
 layoffs
 at
 the
 very
 start
 of
 the


pandemic.
 It
 was
 approximately
 27,000


jobs
 cut
 across
 all
 sectors,
 including


tech.
 I
 wasn't
 able
 to
 find
 the
 exact


number
 and
 reliable
 number
 specifically


for
 tech
 jobs,
 but
 the
 tech
 sector's


layoffs
 were
 smaller
 in
 scale
 and


shorter
 in
 duration
 compared
 to
 Germany.


Sweden
 holds
 the
 title
 for
 the
 highest


reemployment
 rate
 in
 the
 developed


world.
 More
 than
 80%
 of
 laid-off
 workers


find
 new
 jobs
 within
 a
 year,
 which
 is


the
 best
 rate
 in
 the
 developed


countries.
 By
 2024
 and
 2025,
 Sweden's


tech
 industry
 recovered
 much
 better
 than


that
 of
 the
 rest
 of
 Europe
 with
 high


demand
 for
 specialized
 talent
 and
 a


wonderful
 startup
 and
 innovation


ecosystems.
 The
 sector
 has
 shown


remarkable
 resilience
 with
 layoffs


mostly
 limited
 to
 high-profile
 cases


like
 Spotify
 and
 Northworld
 and
 no


sustained
 wave
 of
 tech
 job
 losses
 in


2025.
 So
 to
 be
 fair,
 while
 the
 tech


market
 is
 bad
 pretty
 much
 everywhere,


Sweden's
 not
 exactly
 a
 disaster.
 Quality


of
 talent.
 German
 tech
 talent
 is
 highly


educated.
 Education
 in
 Germany
 is
 of


very
 high
 quality,
 and
 it's
 very


affordable
 because
 public
 universities


charge
 little
 to
 no
 tuition
 fees,
 making


education
 accessible
 to
 both
 domestic


and
 international
 students.
 And
 at
 this


point,
 all
 North
 Americans
 listening
 to


this
 got
 a
 little
 tear
 rolling
 down


their
 face
 because
 most
 of
 us
 graduate


with
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 dollars
 in


debt.
 sometimes
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of


dollars.
 Germany
 has
 lots
 to
 be
 proud


of,
 and
 I'll
 do
 a
 breakdown
 by
 the
 city.


Berlin.
 Berlin
 is
 Germany's
 top
 startup


hub,
 home
 to
 unicorns
 like
 Zelando,
 N26,


Delivery
 Hero,
 and
 several
 very


promising
 autonomous
 driving
 startups.


N26
 apart
 from
 being
 a
 very
 solid
 NEO


bank
 with
 more
 than
 four
 million
 users


and
 a
 nine
 billion
 dollar
 valuation
 at


its
 peak
 is
 widely
 recognized
 as
 the


breeding
 ground
 for
 entrepreneurs
 with


at
 least
 34
 startups
 founded
 by
 N26


alumni.
 Delivery
 Hero
 for
 those
 of
 you


who
 haven't
 heard
 about
 it
 is
 one
 of
 the


world's
 most
 successful
 food
 delivery


companies
 with
 a
 global
 reach
 comparable


to
 Uber
 Eats.
 Deep
 L
 is
 another
 notable


mention
 except
 it's
 based
 in
 Cologne,


not
 in
 Berlin.
 Now,
 please
 don't
 come
 at


me
 and
 be
 like,
 "Yeah,
 well,
 those
 firms


exist,
 but
 how
 many
 people
 work
 there?"


It's
 not
 about
 who
 works
 there
 and
 who


doesn't.
 It's
 a
 fact
 that
 the
 country


either
 produces
 or
 gives
 the
 freedom
 to


top-notch
 talent,
 and
 not
 every
 country


can
 brag
 about
 it.
 Berlin's
 and
 Munich's


tech
 scene
 is
 evolving
 into
 innovation


hubs
 focusing
 on
 AI,
 internet
 of
 things,


autonomous
 driving,
 blockchain,
 and


software
 engineering
 within
 the


industries
 that
 Germany
 has
 historically


been
 known
 for,
 automotive,


manufacturing,
 and
 financial.


Nevertheless,
 for
 the
 third
 year
 in
 a


row,
 the
 annual
 salary
 survey
 for
 the


tech
 and
 startup
 sectors
 reveals
 a


concerning
 trend.
 Median
 salaries
 have


stagnated
 in
 Germany.
 Moving
 on
 to


Munich.
 Munich
 combines
 a
 very
 strong


industrial
 base
 with
 a
 thriving
 startup


scene
 and
 is
 known
 for
 IoT,
 advanced


manufacturing,
 robotics,
 and
 traditional


software
 development.
 Munich's
 notable


babies
 are
 Salon,
 Personio,
 Flicks,


Liliam,
 and
 many
 others.
 Munich
 boasts
 a


dense
 concentration
 of
 STEM
 students.


43%
 of
 them
 are
 local
 graduates
 and
 that


is
 the
 highest
 number
 among
 the
 German


cities.
 Munich
 regularly
 ranks
 as
 one
 of


the
 world's
 best
 cities
 for
 quality
 of


life,
 making
 it
 attractive
 for
 talent


retention
 and
 recruitment.
 Hamburg.


Hamburg
 is
 gaining
 recognition
 as
 the


top
 tech
 city,
 ranking
 number
 two
 in
 the


2024
 talent
 city
 index
 after
 Berlin,
 but


ahead
 of
 Munich.
 They're
 known
 for
 Zing,


several
 gaming
 companies,
 and
 Statista.


The
 city
 leads
 in
 natural
 science


related
 tech,
 logistics,
 and
 fintech.


Hamburg
 offers
 a
 good
 quality
 of
 life


and
 cultural
 diversity,
 making
 it


attractive
 to
 both
 domestic
 and


international
 tech
 professionals.
 And


Frankfurt,
 Frankfurt
 is
 Germany's


financial
 and
 data
 infrastructure
 hub,


handling
 about
 25%
 of
 Europe's
 internet


traffic,
 SAP,
 Software
 AG,
 Equinex,


MongoDB,
 which
 is
 headquartered
 in
 the


US,
 but
 they
 have
 a
 major
 office
 and


talent
 base
 in
 Frankfurt
 and
 Bolt.
 The


city
 is
 known
 for
 fintech
 security,


cloud
 computing
 and
 they
 have
 a
 very


robust
 startup
 ecosystem
 as
 well.


Frankfurt
 combines
 high
 earning


potential
 with
 a
 great
 city
 experience


and
 it
 also
 happens
 to
 be
 a
 very


convenient
 travel
 hub
 as
 you
 can
 fly


pretty
 much
 anywhere
 from
 Frankfurt.
 Now


onto
 some
 not
 so
 obvious
 trends
 Germany


is
 experiencing
 as
 a
 result
 of
 tech


layoffs
 and
 offshoring
 and
 that
 dare
 I


say
 I
 predict
 will
 emerge
 even
 more


strongly
 in
 the
 coming
 years.
 Germany
 is


experiencing
 freelance
 boom
 beyond


traditional
 entrepreneurship.
 There
 is
 a


marked
 increase
 in
 tech
 workers
 opting


for
 freelancing
 and
 independent


contracting.
 Germany
 now
 has
 over
 4


million
 freelancers
 with
 a
 significant


concentration
 in
 IT
 media
 and


consulting.
 This
 shift
 is
 fueled
 by
 the


flexibility
 and
 the
 rise
 of
 remote
 work


and
 the
 platforms
 that
 connect


freelancers
 with
 clients.
 Higher
 rates


and
 autonomy.
 Many
 freelancers
 command


higher
 rates
 than
 salaried
 employees.


But
 even
 then,
 the
 contractor
 employee


is
 often
 cheaper
 for
 the
 company
 than
 a


salaried
 employee,
 and
 contractors
 enjoy


greater
 autonomy
 and
 project
 selection.


As
 a
 result
 of
 the
 tech
 layoffs,
 the


overall
 economic
 stagnation
 in
 Europe,


and
 the
 rise
 of
 freelancing,
 another


trend
 is
 emerging,
 a
 rise
 in


entrepreneurship,
 especially
 among
 the


youth.
 We're
 already
 seeing
 early
 signs,


and
 in
 my
 view,
 it's
 only
 going
 to


accelerate.
 This
 surge
 is
 closely
 tied


to
 the
 aftermath
 of
 layoffs,
 people


seeking
 non-traditional
 employment,
 and


the
 shift
 towards
 remote
 work.
 Shift


away
 from
 traditional
 hubs.
 As
 companies


relocate
 or
 downsize
 in
 Berlin
 and
 other


major
 tech
 cities,
 tech
 talent
 is


dispersing
 to
 smaller
 towns
 in
 Germany


and
 abroad.
 Some
 companies
 now
 require


relocation
 to
 less
 traditional
 tech


centers
 within
 Germany
 such
 as
 Mannheim


or
 Nerburgg
 or
 encourage
 employees
 to


move
 to
 other
 countries
 such
 as
 Poland,


Spain
 or
 Portugal.
 Sectoral
 spread
 with


tech

 offshore
 remaining


German
 offices
 are
 increasingly
 focused


on

 and
 German
 speaking

 while

 and

 the


vibe.
 Germany
 is
 the
 country
 I
 travel
 to


the
 most
 whenever
 I
 go
 to
 Europe
 as
 I


have
 personal
 ties
 to
 it.
 There
 are


things
 I
 love
 about
 it.
 There
 are
 things


I
 am
 not
 so
 jived
 about,
 just
 like
 with


any
 other
 place.
 So,
 please
 take
 this


with
 a
 grain
 of
 salt.
 I
 will
 do
 my
 best


to
 focus
 on
 the
 vibe
 of
 the
 tech
 scene.


But,
 please
 keep
 in
 mind
 that
 this
 is
 a


mix
 of
 tech
 impressions
 and
 personal


perception
 of
 the
 country.
 So,
 in
 my


books,
 the
 German
 tech
 scene
 is
 very


similar
 to
 the
 cars
 it's
 producing.


Germany's
 tech
 is
 like
 a
 BMV.


Wait,
 what?


[Music]


Learn
 it.
 It's
 not
 crazy
 glamorous,
 but


it's
 very
 sturdy.
 It's
 very
 durable
 and


very
 reliable.
 It
 is
 not
 insanely


experimental.
 It
 is
 not
 claiming
 to
 be


developing
 the
 time
 machine
 and
 it


doesn't
 promise
 the
 future
 by
 2030
 but


instead
 it
 fully
 embraces
 the
 innovation


coming
 from
 the
 US
 or
 China
 and
 it
 sets


its
 own
 standards
 in
 industrial
 and


applied
 tech
 and
 they
 deliver
 what
 they


do
 best
 quality
 durability
 and


predictability.
 As
 for
 the
 downsides,


Germany
 is
 struggling
 to
 stay


competitive
 in
 manufacturing
 against


China.
 And
 I
 explained
 earlier
 why


manufacturing
 is
 so
 important,
 even
 in


the
 context
 of
 tech.
 It's
 getting
 harder


and
 harder
 for
 Germany
 to
 stay
 afloat


and
 competitive.
 I
 grew
 up
 with
 the


stereotype
 that
 if
 you
 own
 anything


Germanmade,
 this
 thing
 is
 going
 to
 be


top-notch.
 This
 thing
 will
 last
 forever.


But
 at
 this
 point,
 when
 making
 certain


buying
 decisions,
 I
 do
 want
 to
 admit


that
 Chinese
 alternatives
 often
 blow
 my


mind.
 And
 objectively,
 I
 can
 see
 why


Germany
 is
 going
 through
 economics


technation
 in
 the
 manufacturing
 sector.


Nevertheless,
 as
 of
 2025,
 the
 way
 I
 see


German
 tech
 vibe
 is
 that
 it
 is
 still
 a


very
 solid
 place
 for
 tech
 in
 Europe
 if


you
 are
 in
 a
 high
 demand
 specialty.
 But


for
 tech
 industry,
 it
 is
 not
 the
 same


country
 that
 it
 was
 10
 years
 ago.
 But


again,
 this
 applies
 to
 the
 entire
 G7


cost
 of
 living.
 So,
 the
 more
 videos
 I'm


making
 in
 the
 series,
 the
 more
 comments


I
 get
 from
 people
 with
 often
 very
 solid


arguments
 and
 constructive
 push
 back.


And
 to
 all
 of
 the
 people
 who
 provide


respectful
 feedback
 in
 the
 comments,
 I


truly
 thank
 you.
 I
 do
 appreciate
 the


ability
 to
 be
 respectful
 and
 civil
 even


when
 you
 disagree.
 And
 that
 also
 helps


me
 get
 better
 in
 my
 research.
 So
 I've


decided
 to
 use
 slightly
 different


metrics
 this
 time
 to
 paint
 the
 picture


of
 the
 Germany's
 economic
 situation
 for


tech
 workers
 that
 is
 postcoid
 and
 post


pandemic.
 Now
 I
 got
 to
 mention
 one
 thing


before
 I
 talk
 about
 the
 numbers.
 As
 I


was
 doing
 the
 research
 for
 this
 I
 went


through
 multiple
 reports
 published
 by


Euroat
 painting
 a
 very
 sad
 picture
 and


the
 federal
 statistics
 office
 saying


that
 the
 Euroat
 is
 exaggerating
 and
 the


numbers
 are
 especially
 different
 when
 it


comes
 to
 poverty
 levels.
 Now,
 I'm
 not
 an


economist
 by
 any
 means,
 and
 I'm
 not


taking
 on
 a
 mission
 to
 interpret


Germany's
 full
 economic
 situation.
 So,


I'm
 going
 to
 focus
 on
 the
 summary
 that
 I


compiled
 based
 on
 single
 person
 expenses


for
 a
 senior
 level
 tech
 worker
 such
 as
 a


data
 scientist
 or
 a
 product
 manager.


Now,
 why
 these
 two
 roles?
 Because
 they


represent
 two
 of
 the
 biggest
 audience


groups
 on
 my
 channel,
 and
 they
 also


capture
 software
 engineering
 salaries


because
 they're
 very
 close
 to
 these
 data


points
 as
 well.
 Cost
 of
 living
 in


TechHubs,
 Berlin.
 A
 senior
 data


scientist
 pulls
 in
 around
 84
 to
 €110,000


euros
 with
 median
 salary
 being
 just


short
 of


€100,000.
 Senior
 PM's
 similar
 situation


between
 91
 and
 125
 with
 median
 at
 102.


Now
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 the
 tax
 rate


here
 and
 I
 want
 to
 clarify
 a
 few
 things


about
 the
 tax
 rate
 that
 I
 put
 at
 this


table.
 There
 is
 a
 difference
 between
 the


effective
 tax
 rate
 and
 the
 total
 tax.


The
 effective
 tax
 is
 what
 is
 used
 in


international
 comparisons
 focusing
 on


income
 tax.
 It
 does
 not
 include
 social


security
 contributions.
 So
 the
 total
 tax


would
 be
 higher
 if
 social
 security
 is


included.
 I
 did
 not
 include
 social


security
 numbers
 because
 they
 can
 vary


greatly
 depending
 on
 the
 employment


type,
 income
 level,
 and
 personal


circumstances.
 Munich
 salaries
 are
 about


the
 same,
 but
 the
 cost
 of
 living
 is
 much


higher.
 Munich
 is
 known
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the


most
 expensive
 places
 in
 Germany.


Hamburg,
 lower
 salaries
 and
 lower
 cost


of
 living.
 Also,
 based
 on
 the
 data
 I
 was


able
 to
 find,
 PMs
 tend
 to
 make
 less
 in


Hamburg
 for
 some
 reason.
 So,
 folks
 in


Hamburg
 or
 in
 Germany
 in
 general
 would


love
 to
 hear
 your
 take,
 especially
 if


you
 know
 why
 that
 is.
 And
 lastly,


Frankfurt
 salaries
 very
 similar
 to


Hamburg,
 but
 cost
 of
 living
 slightly


higher.
 Conclusion,
 when
 is
 Germany
 a


good
 idea?
 Germany
 is
 great
 if
 you
 live


in
 Germany
 already
 and
 you
 want
 to
 stay


within
 the
 European
 Union.
 It
 still
 has


one
 of
 the
 strongest
 tech


infrastructures
 on
 the
 continent
 and
 it


is
 great
 if
 you
 are
 in
 emerging
 tech,


fintech
 or
 IoT.
 You're
 a
 specialist
 in
 a


high
 demand,
 robotics,
 computer
 vision,


cloud,
 machine
 learning,
 cyber
 security


and
 you
 don't
 mind
 stability
 over
 hype.


It
 is
 great
 if
 you
 want
 access
 to


worldclass
 universities
 and
 lowcost


education
 for
 you
 and
 your
 family.
 And


it
 is
 great
 if
 you
 prefer
 working
 in
 a


country
 where
 English
 is
 commonly
 spoken


in
 the
 tech
 scene.
 But
 the
 culture
 still


prioritizes
 local
 integration.
 When
 is


Germany
 not
 a
 good
 idea?
 If
 you're


hoping
 for
 rapid
 salary
 growth,
 median


pay
 in
 Germany
 is
 stagnating
 and
 the


total
 tax
 plus
 the
 social
 security


contributions
 cut
 deep
 into
 your


take-home
 budget.
 If
 you're
 looking
 for


high
 growth
 startup
 energy
 like
 American


style
 energy
 because
 much
 of
 that
 is


relocating
 to
 cheaper,
 more
 agile


markets
 like
 Spain,
 Portugal,
 and


Eastern
 Europe.
 And
 if
 you're
 in
 a
 role


that
 is
 increasingly
 outsourced,


front-end
 development
 or
 QA,
 cost


pressures
 and
 remote
 work
 are


accelerating
 this
 trend.
 And
 lastly,
 if


you're
 coming
 from
 the
 US
 or
 Canada,


expecting
 a
 drastic
 quality
 of
 life


upgrade.
 Keep
 in
 mind
 that
 the


trade-offs
 in
 flexibility,
 bureaucracy,


and
 cost
 after
 tax
 will
 make
 it
 pretty


much
 similar
 to
 the
 countries
 that


you're
 coming
 from.
 And
 that's
 a
 wrap


for
 Germany.
 Next
 up
 is
 the
 United


Kingdom.
 As
 always,
 I
 hope
 this
 was


helpful.
 Till
 next
 time.
 Bye.
