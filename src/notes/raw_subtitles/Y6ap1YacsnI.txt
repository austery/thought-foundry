Canadian
 tech
 firms
 can
 face
 challenges


getting
 capital
 and
 keeping
 talent.
 So,


what
 can
 we
 do
 to
 help
 founders
 build


companies
 here
 at
 home?
 Abdullah
 Nobar,


the
 executive
 director
 of
 DMZ,
 a
 tech


incubator
 at
 Toronto
 Metropolitan


University,
 and
 Kelsey
 Han,
 the
 CEO
 of


Monarch,
 a
 leadership
 development


platform,
 sat
 down
 with
 me
 to
 explain.


[Music]


Abdullah,
 Kelsey,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


joining
 us
 on
 the
 rundown.
 Um,
 I'm
 gonna


start
 with
 you,
 Kelsey.
 Which
 is
 the


bigger
 problem
 in
 Canada?
 Enticing


people
 to
 begin
 startups
 or
 increasing


the
 size
 of
 existing
 ones?


>> I
 think
 for
 me
 um
 there
 I
 would
 probably


go
 with
 um
 enticing
 people
 to
 start


companies.
 I
 you
 know
 I
 think
 part
 of


what
 we
 have
 in
 Canada
 right
 now
 is
 a


bit
 of
 an
 entrepreneurship


>> challenge.
 Um
 this
 country
 was
 built
 on


entrepreneurs.
 If
 you
 think
 about
 it,
 we


are
 only
 most
 of
 us
 are
 only
 one
 or
 two


generations
 removed
 from
 parents
 or


grandparents
 that
 moved
 to
 this
 country


uh
 and
 started
 their
 own
 businesses.
 And


I,
 you
 know,
 what
 we've
 seen
 over
 the


last
 20
 years
 is
 entrepreneurship
 rates


have
 been
 lowering.
 Um
 and
 so
 we
 have


approximately
 um
 100,000
 less
 than
 we


did
 20
 years
 ago.
 And
 yet
 over
 that
 same


period,
 our
 population
 has
 increased


drastically.
 Um
 and
 so
 I
 think
 you
 know


there's
 there's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 um


stigma
 in
 some
 ways
 that
 comes
 with


entrepreneurship.
 You
 know
 in
 the
 US
 we


celebrate
 entrepreneurs
 and
 it
 looks
 a


little
 bit
 more
 like
 a
 badge
 of
 honor


and
 experience
 and
 we
 celebrate
 failure


and
 in
 Canada
 um
 you
 know
 I
 can
 speak


for
 myself
 but
 the
 you
 know
 the
 first


thing
 I
 thought
 when
 starting
 a
 company


was
 oh
 I'm
 going to
 have
 to
 move
 away
 if


I
 fail


>> um
 because
 I
 would
 lose
 you
 know
 all
 my


networks
 and
 contacts.
 So
 yeah,
 I
 think


for
 me
 it's
 it's
 more
 of
 the


entrepreneurship
 piece.


>> Abdullah,


>> they're
 so
 intertwined
 to
 be
 honest
 with


you
 that
 it's
 hard
 to
 kind
 of
 pinpoint


on
 one.
 I
 do
 agree
 with
 Kelsey
 though.


It
 is
 becoming
 a
 bigger
 challenge
 for


you
 know
 to
 see
 the
 the
 energy
 that
 you


need
 in
 a
 market
 that
 needs
 to
 build
 the


right
 incentives
 to
 to
 help


entrepreneurs
 kind
 of
 start
 an
 idea
 and


start
 a
 company
 here
 in
 Canada.
 Truth
 be


told,
 once
 people
 build
 a
 company,
 I


think
 they
 quickly
 realize
 how
 difficult


it
 is
 to
 scale
 uh
 uh
 in
 in
 Canada,
 not


because
 we're
 in
 a
 small
 country
 only,


but
 because
 the
 conditions
 haven't
 been


created
 in
 a
 way
 that
 would
 allow
 an


entrepreneur
 to
 really
 leverage
 the
 full


extent
 of
 what
 Canada
 has
 to
 offer.
 Um,


and
 I
 know
 we
 could
 talk
 a
 lot
 about


these
 things,
 but
 three
 areas
 that
 we


really
 uh
 identified
 as
 big
 challenges


today.
 Uh,
 number
 one
 is,
 you
 know,
 how


do
 you
 take
 IP
 to
 commercialization?
 And


that
 really
 gets
 back
 to
 the
 question
 of


how
 do
 you
 really
 build
 really
 good


companies
 that
 have
 the
 potential
 to


become
 billion-dollar
 businesses
 in
 the


future
 uh
 by
 leveraging
 the
 in
 insane


amount
 of
 dollars
 that
 we're
 putting


into
 research
 here
 in
 this
 country,
 but


uh
 and
 not
 able
 to
 really
 build
 the


incentives
 to
 get
 that
 research
 to


commercial
 uh
 uh
 reality.
 The
 second


part
 is
 around
 VC
 and
 just
 venture


capital
 dollars
 and
 the
 amount
 of
 money


that
 can
 be
 supporting
 the
 company's


growth


in
 many
 ways
 limited.
 I
 won't
 say


non-existent
 because
 that's
 not
 true,


but
 it's
 very
 limited
 um
 in
 a
 way
 that


doesn't
 really
 feed
 the
 entire
 funnel
 of


of
 of
 of
 need
 uh
 from
 a
 startup


perspective,
 especially
 with
 the
 amount


of
 talent
 that
 we
 have
 uh
 in
 Canada.
 And


then
 finally,
 I
 think
 the
 government
 uh


plays
 a
 big
 role
 in
 this
 actually
 and


being
 able
 to
 shine
 a
 light
 on
 a
 lot
 of


the
 entrepreneurs
 and
 the
 founders
 that


are
 being
 supported
 uh
 locally
 and


globally.
 Uh
 but
 then
 it
 goes
 deeper


into
 things
 like
 procurement
 uh
 and
 even


uh
 into
 buying
 Canadian
 and
 putting


Canadians
 first.


>> Kelsey,
 there
 are
 some
 companies,


Canadian
 companies
 that
 go
 to
 the
 US.
 uh


do
 we
 have
 an
 idea
 of
 how
 many
 uh


Canadian
 tech
 firms
 are
 deciding
 to
 go


south
 of
 the
 border
 for
 maybe
 greener


pastures?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 look,
 I
 think
 every


Canadian
 founder
 starts
 their
 company


and
 probably
 one
 of
 the
 first
 pieces
 of


advice
 they
 hear
 is
 get
 your
 product
 to


the
 US.
 I
 mean
 that
 is
 the
 playbook.


build
 if
 you
 can
 build
 your
 company,


build
 your
 talent
 inside
 of
 Canada
 and


go
 get
 your
 revenue
 outside
 of
 Canada
 as


soon
 as
 possible.
 Validate
 beyond
 our


borders.
 Um,
 and
 I
 think,
 you
 know,


there's
 some
 pros
 and
 cons
 to
 that,
 but


um,
 it's
 it's
 largely
 an
 issue
 of
 market


size.
 Um,
 we
 know
 that
 obviously.
 Um,


there's
 just
 much
 more
 opportunity


there.
 But
 I
 think
 when
 it
 comes
 to,
 it


kind
 of
 goes
 back
 to
 my
 point
 around


productivity.
 there's
 also
 just
 a


willingness
 to
 adopt
 technology
 faster.


Um,
 and
 so,
 you
 know,
 you
 hear
 of
 these


stories
 where
 Canadian
 companies,
 you


know,
 there's
 one
 in
 Calgary
 that
 has
 um


I
 think
 over
 90%
 of
 their
 customer
 base


comes
 from
 the
 US,
 but
 they
 have
 over


100
 employees
 headquartered
 in
 Alberta.


>> Um,
 and
 so
 that
 that's
 a
 common
 story


for
 many
 many
 Canadian
 startups.


>> Abdullah,
 you
 are
 in
 the
 incubation


space.
 there
 are
 some
 very,
 you
 know,


eager
 people
 to
 build
 something
 and
 I


imagine
 maybe
 if
 you
 can
 pick
 up
 on
 the


point
 what
 Kelsey
 said
 is
 the
 playbook


to
 go
 to
 the
 US.


>> Look,
 yeah,
 we
 we
 don't
 have
 an


innovation
 problem.
 We
 don't
 have
 a


talent
 problem.
 Uh
 we
 certainly
 don't


have
 an
 ambition
 problem
 in
 Canada.
 We


have
 we've
 built
 great
 companies
 today.


We've
 had
 an
 an
 an
 incredible
 uh
 uh
 past


where
 Canada
 has
 been
 a
 leader
 on


innovation
 in
 many
 ways.
 what
 we
 don't


have
 is
 the
 right
 infrastructure
 and
 the


right
 incentives
 in
 place
 to
 allow
 uh


people
 to
 really
 again
 build
 for
 to


their
 full
 extent
 while
 being
 here
 in


Canada.
 And
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 that
 when


someone's
 looking
 to
 expand
 and
 build


their
 company,
 they
 don't
 think
 about


going
 from
 Ontario
 to
 Alberta
 or
 to
 BC


or
 to
 Quebec.
 They
 think
 about
 going


south
 because
 it
 actually
 is
 uh
 a
 lot
 of


hurdles
 and
 red
 tape
 that
 they
 have
 to


encounter
 by
 going
 interprovincial
 uh


that
 we
 don't
 realize
 is
 a
 lost


opportunity.
 And
 this
 is
 part
 of
 the


reality
 that
 founders
 have
 to
 face.
 And


when
 you're
 building
 a
 company,
 it's


your
 livelihood.
 You
 will
 do
 whatever
 it


takes
 to
 keep
 that
 company
 alive.
 And
 if


it
 means
 going
 south,
 that's
 what
 you


do.
 Uh
 but
 there
 certainly
 isn't
 a
 lack


of
 of
 of
 of
 ambition
 in
 what
 Canadians


can
 do
 here.
 And
 and
 quite
 quite


frankly,
 the
 need
 to
 to
 build
 a
 business


has
 to
 always
 be
 thought
 of
 globally.
 uh


where
 our
 challenges
 come
 to
 come
 to


come
 to
 set
 right
 now
 is
 that
 Canadians


are
 leaving
 sometimes
 the
 country
 to
 go


build
 abroad.
 That
 doesn't
 need
 to
 be


the
 case.
 Uh
 Kelsey
 as
 is
 a
 good
 example


of
 that
 can
 continue
 being
 in
 Canada,


being
 in
 her
 home,
 building
 a
 global


business,
 hiring
 global
 talent,
 uh
 but


focusing
 her
 HQ
 here
 right
 here
 in


Canada.
 That
 needs
 to
 be
 the
 story
 line


that
 we
 continue
 building
 moving


forward.
 Otherwise,
 it's
 really
 it's


ours
 to
 lose.
 It's
 a
 story
 that
 we
 have


control
 of.
 the
 narrative
 should
 be
 in


our
 favor,
 but
 you
 know,
 we're
 not


building
 the
 right
 blocks
 to
 to
 to
 to
 go


in
 that
 direction.


>> All right,
 I
 want
 to
 pick
 up
 with


Kelsey.
 Uh
 Abdullah,
 you
 talked
 about


interprovincial
 trade
 barriers.
 Uh


Kelsey,
 you
 are
 based
 in
 Canada.
 Um
 I
 am


curious,
 what
 are
 the
 barriers?
 What
 are


those
 international
 barriers
 that
 are


maybe
 perhaps
 permit
 uh
 you
 know


stopping
 you
 from
 building
 in
 the
 US
 if


that
 is
 something
 that
 you
 want
 to
 do?


>> Yeah.
 So
 uh
 honestly
 we're
 an
 AI
 based


uh
 company
 and
 so
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we


do
 is
 we
 we
 have
 a
 leadership


intelligence
 product.
 So
 we
 analyze


real-time
 meeting
 data
 from
 leaders
 and


their
 direct
 reports.
 Um
 and
 then
 we


turn
 that
 into
 performance
 insights
 to


help
 them
 manage
 their
 lives
 more


easily.
 Um
 and
 so
 one
 of
 our
 biggest


challenges
 of
 course
 is
 security
 risk


compliance
 um
 and
 all
 of
 the
 different


standards
 you
 know
 across
 Europe,
 the
 UK


and
 the
 US
 um
 which
 which
 vary
 right
 um


based
 on
 where
 you
 are
 the
 you
 know
 the


rules
 of
 notetakers
 what
 kind
 of
 data


you
 can
 keep
 where
 it
 is
 stored
 um
 how


you
 use
 that
 data
 highly
 varies.
 So
 that


would
 be
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 challenges


as
 AI
 companies
 navigate
 those
 borders


which
 I
 think
 you
 know
 I
 think
 that's


probably
 an
 acute
 problem.
 I
 think
 we're


going
 to
 see
 that
 all
 catch
 up
 rapidly


over
 the
 next
 um
 couple
 of
 years.


>> I
 want
 to
 stick
 with
 you
 Kelsey
 because


I
 want
 to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 uh
 let's


talk
 dollars.
 Um
 how
 much
 money
 do
 you


think
 you
 could
 raise
 if
 you
 moved
 your


company
 to
 the
 US?
 Because
 correct
 me
 if


I'm
 wrong.
 Is
 it
 a
 is
 it
 a
 403
 area
 code


in
 Calgary?


>> Yes.


>> Is
 is
 there
 does
 there
 is
 there
 a
 little


discrimination
 when
 uh
 we're
 talking


investors
 when
 they
 see
 maybe
 a
 403
 area


code
 versus
 uh
 maybe
 area
 code
 south
 of


the
 border?


>> Oh.
 Oh
 yeah.
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 that's
 one


piece
 in
 investing
 for
 sure.
 Um
 but
 no


question
 as
 well
 in
 selling
 I
 think
 um


we
 get
 obviously
 tons
 of
 inbound
 from


Canadian
 companies
 and
 um
 there
 is
 an


element
 of
 let's
 make
 sure
 they
 don't


see
 we're
 too
 Canadian


>> um
 because
 that
 would
 signal
 maybe
 we


move
 slower,
 maybe
 we're
 a
 smaller
 team,


um
 maybe
 we
 don't
 have
 clients
 in
 the


US.
 it,
 you
 know,
 and
 it
 just
 signals


the
 things
 that
 you
 don't
 want
 a
 client


to
 not
 get
 you
 to
 that
 next
 meeting


stage.
 Um,
 yeah,
 and
 I
 have
 friends


that,
 um,
 have
 you
 founder
 friends
 that


purposely
 buy
 and
 use
 different
 area


code
 numbers
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 when


they're
 cold
 calling
 and
 doing
 their


sales
 calls,
 um,
 it
 doesn't
 appear
 that


they're
 coming
 from
 a
 Canadian
 number.


And
 so
 yeah,
 lots
 of
 Canadian
 startups


know
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 those
 tricks
 of
 the


trade
 um
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 know
 we


take
 some
 of
 that
 bias
 out
 of
 either
 the


sales
 or
 the
 investment
 process.


>> Very
 good.
 Abdullah,
 um
 Kelsey
 talked


AI,
 so
 let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about


that.
 How
 much
 harder
 is
 it
 for
 Canadian


tech
 firms
 to
 find
 funding
 right
 now
 if


their
 business
 is
 not
 leveraged
 by
 AI?


Yeah,
 look,
 we're
 in
 a
 moment
 now
 where


AI,
 generative
 AI
 is
 everything,
 right?


So,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 founders
 in


the
 companies
 have
 now
 shifted
 their


businesses
 to
 be
 called
 either
 native
 AI


companies
 or
 AI
 enabled
 businesses.
 It


really
 is
 the
 movement.
 Um,
 but
 um,


look,
 it
 I
 I
 it
 needs
 to
 be
 incorporated


in
 some
 way,
 shape
 or
 form.
 uh
 and


companies
 that
 are
 building
 deep


technologies
 and
 really
 thinking
 about


the
 future
 and
 what's
 what's
 to
 come
 are


naturally
 just
 incorporating
 AI
 into


into
 their
 into
 their
 startup.
 So
 it's


not
 uh
 you
 know
 it's
 no
 longer
 a
 matter


of
 is
 is
 it
 incorporated
 it's
 a
 matter


of
 how
 how
 deep
 into
 the
 business


actually
 is
 it
 layered
 in
 and
 what
 are


you
 doing
 with
 it
 to
 create
 a


differentiated
 product.
 So
 it
 it
 would


certainly
 be
 difficult
 to
 you
 know


capture
 the
 the
 VC
 dollars
 if
 you
 will


uh
 without
 having
 that
 well
 thought
 out.


Um
 uh
 and
 but
 again
 Canada
 is
 has
 always


been
 you
 know
 at
 the
 forefront
 of
 this


space
 and
 you
 know
 um
 something
 that
 we


should
 take
 pride
 in
 the
 fact
 that
 we've


helped
 build
 some
 of
 the
 biggest


capabilities
 in
 the
 world
 from
 an
 AI


perspective
 and
 something
 that
 we
 have


such
 strength
 and
 and and
 uh
 and
 rigor


with
 and
 right
 here
 in
 our
 backyard
 in


Canada.
 A
 AI
 programming
 we
 know
 is
 is


different
 than
 traditional
 coding.


Kelsey,
 do
 we
 have
 enough
 AI
 graduates


or
 experienced
 coders
 who
 could
 handle


um
 the
 demand
 that
 is
 out
 there
 right


now?
 Are
 you
 hiring
 right
 now?
 Are
 you


looking
 for
 uh
 some
 programmers
 and


coders?


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 mean
 always
 hiring
 AI
 talent


and
 trying
 to
 keep
 them
 with
 us.
 You


know,
 I
 think
 we
 we
 are
 lucky
 in
 Canada


in
 that
 is
 an
 amazing
 place
 to
 live,


build
 a
 family,
 incredible
 work
 life


balance.
 It's
 still
 obviously
 relatively


affordable


um
 you
 know,
 politically
 stable.
 And
 so


we
 do
 have
 other
 factors
 that
 can


attract
 um
 people
 to
 come
 and
 set
 up


their
 lives.
 And
 I
 think
 for
 many


startups,
 we're
 holding
 on
 to
 that


because
 if
 our
 talent
 went
 south,
 we


would
 not
 be
 able
 to
 compete
 on
 the


salaries
 and
 the
 drop
 of
 our
 dollar.
 And


so,
 we're
 just
 becoming
 less
 and
 less


competitive.
 Do
 I
 think
 that
 we
 have
 the


the
 talent
 here?
 And
 do
 I
 think
 we
 can


continue
 to
 attract
 the
 talent?


Absolutely.
 Um
 but
 you
 know
 AI


developers
 and
 I
 think
 no
 different
 than


other
 developers
 and
 engineers
 they
 want


to
 work
 for
 big
 innovative
 companies


that
 have
 gumption.


>> Um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 that
 would
 be
 more
 of


my
 call
 to
 action
 is
 like
 we
 need
 to


support
 these
 big
 companies
 to


Abdullah's
 point
 like
 getting
 past
 that


or
 into
 that
 growth
 stage
 um
 because


they
 want
 exciting
 meaty
 challenging


problems.
 Um
 they
 want
 to
 solve
 them.


They're
 hungry.
 They're
 very
 curious
 and


we
 need
 to
 keep
 that
 talent
 here.


>> Well,
 let's
 talk
 incentives,
 Abdullah.


What
 incentives
 uh
 can
 employers
 uh
 put


out
 there
 to
 keep
 people
 here
 in
 Canada?


Well,
 look,
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 comes
 down
 to


from
 my
 side,
 I'm
 talking
 about


particular
 startups,
 you
 know,
 to
 keep


startups
 here
 in
 Canada
 and
 want
 them
 to


kind
 of
 continue
 to
 grow
 and
 scale
 their


businesses.
 You
 need
 to
 build
 maybe
 the


two
 of the
 biggest
 things
 that
 we
 know


in
 the
 in
 the
 south
 in
 the
 US
 that


they've
 done
 really
 well
 is
 speed,


>> scale,
 and
 the
 ability
 to
 actually


procure
 government
 contracts.
 Um,
 if


we're
 able
 to
 figure
 out
 a
 model
 that


would
 push
 uh
 the
 the
 the
 market
 here
 to


start
 being
 first
 to
 move
 as
 opposed
 to


always
 be
 a
 follow
 a
 follower
 in
 terms


of
 what
 the
 US
 is
 doing
 and
 how
 the
 US


is
 doing
 things.
 uh
 the
 ability
 to


actually
 uh
 remove
 some
 red
 tape
 and
 the


barriers
 uh
 uh
 that
 would
 allow


Canadians
 to
 scale
 within
 their
 own
 uh


backyard
 uh
 from
 province
 to
 province
 to


province
 from
 market
 and
 then
 in


particular
 to
 government
 um
 and
 imagine


for
 a
 day
 that
 we're
 able
 to
 unlock
 the


biggest
 customer
 in
 the
 country
 for


founders
 to
 actually
 leverage
 so
 that


when
 they
 go
 abroad
 and
 start
 to
 to
 grow


their
 companies
 and
 hire
 the
 best
 talent


they
 can
 start
 with
 the
 position
 that


our
 biggest
 customer
 or
 one
 of
 our


biggest
 customers
 in
 the
 world
 is
 the


Canadian
 government
 or
 the
 provincial


government
 of
 Ontario
 of
 Alberta,
 BC
 of


Quebec.
 Uh
 that
 in
 itself
 holds
 so
 much


weight
 that
 we
 haven't
 been
 able
 to


crack
 yet.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 those
 are
 some


of
 the
 big
 incentives
 that
 will
 beyond


what
 uh
 what
 you
 know
 Kelsey
 mentioned


around
 safety
 and
 standard
 of
 living
 and


stability.
 You
 know
 there
 needs
 to
 be


again
 an
 entire
 uh
 uh
 cohesive
 market


that's
 opening
 up
 that
 allows
 companies


to
 see
 themselves
 being
 able
 to
 build
 a


business
 that
 would
 actually
 grow
 and


scale.
 And
 it
 has
 to
 go
 beyond
 the


non-dilutive
 funding
 the
 grants
 that


Canadians
 are
 so
 well
 equipped
 to
 get.


uh
 but
 um
 that
 in
 itself
 won't
 make
 us


the
 most
 competitive
 nation
 uh
 in


building
 what
 we
 want
 to
 build.
 We
 need


to
 create
 a
 market
 that's
 that
 know
 that


has
 speed
 that's
 able
 to
 uh
 think
 about


scale
 across
 borders
 across
 uh
 provinces


across
 countries
 and
 then
 looking
 at


procurement
 from
 a
 government


perspective.


>> Kelsey,
 last
 question
 to
 you.
 What
 are


some
 of
 those
 potential
 solutions
 to


entice,
 you
 know,
 tech
 firms
 to
 remain


headquartered
 in
 Canada?
 Oh
 gosh,
 so


many.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 of
 course
 tax


incentives
 help.
 Of
 course,
 the


scientific
 research
 uh
 the
 shred
 program


that
 the
 Canadian
 government


incentivizes
 for
 R&D
 is
 incredible
 and


we
 need
 more
 incentives
 like
 that
 for


Canadian
 businesses
 around,
 you
 know,


Abdullah
 mentioned
 it,
 government


contracts
 around
 buying
 Canadian
 tech.


Um,
 so
 tax
 credits,
 incentives
 to


encourage
 adoption,
 pilots.
 Um,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 face
 it
 as


Canadians.
 We
 do
 not
 we
 inherently
 don't


like
 risk.
 Um,
 which
 is
 unfortunate,


right?
 We're
 we're
 kind
 of
 we
 always


have
 this
 cultural
 belief
 that
 just
 we


aren't
 good
 enough.
 We
 aren't
 as
 good
 as


the
 US
 and
 maybe
 our
 products
 aren't
 as


good,
 which
 is
 absolutely
 not
 true.
 Our


products
 are
 as
 good,
 if
 not
 better.
 Um


and
 so
 we're
 always
 looking
 for
 that


external
 validation
 and
 um
 I
 think
 we


need
 to
 be
 the
 champion
 of
 our
 own


entrepreneurs.
 We
 need
 to
 dig
 in
 to
 what


started
 this
 country.
 Um
 and
 we
 need
 to


champion
 and
 support
 the
 incredible


ideas
 and
 innovation
 ecosystem
 that
 we


are
 building
 here.
 Um
 and
 that
 is
 not


just
 tech
 in
 and
 of
 itself.
 It
 goes


beyond
 the
 tech
 borders.
 Right?
 That's


to
 to
 Abdullah's
 point
 from
 uh


universities,
 ecosystem
 partners,


government
 and
 private
 businesses,
 other


small
 tomedium
 enterprises
 in
 Canada.


>> Kelsey
 Abdullah,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.


Really
 appreciate
 your
 insights.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you.
