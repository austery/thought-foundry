hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangin
 the
 CEO
 of


noris
 Bank
 investment
 management
 the


Norwegian
 someone
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today


we
 are
 joined
 by
 a
 true
 Visionary
 in
 the


world
 of
 Finance
 Mark
 Rowan
 who


co-founded
 Apollo
 Global
 Management


which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 influential


alternative
 Asset
 Management
 firms
 in


the
 world
 now
 we
 are
 the
 lucky
 owner
 of


just
 under
 2%
 of
 Apollo
 which
 works
 out


at
 just
 under
 one
 and
 a
 half
 billion


dollars
 Mark
 thrill
 to
 be
 here
 great


thanks
 thanks
 for
 coming
 and
 hopefully


you're
 a
 happy
 shareholder


Mark
 in
 um


1984
 you
 said
 God
 I'm
 just
 too
 late
 all


the
 money
 has
 been
 made
 you
 came
 out
 of


business
 school
 now
 a
 few
 years
 later
 uh


you
 have
 assets
 under
 management
 at


Apollo
 of
 680
 billion
 and
 the
 market
 cap


is
 more
 than
 80
 billion
 so
 I
 think
 we


can
 say
 that
 was
 a
 not
 a
 very
 accurate


statement
 well
 I
 I
 think
 it
 was
 accurate


because
 it
 reflected
 the
 business
 at
 the


time
 cuz
 not
 only
 did
 I
 say
 it
 in
 '
 84
 I


said
 it
 in
 90
 and
 I
 said
 it
 again
 in


2001
 and
 the
 point
 being
 in
 some
 ways
 I


was
 too
 late
 for
 the
 business
 that
 had


been
 done
 but
 the
 interesting
 thing
 part


of
 the
 interesting
 part
 of
 the
 job
 is
 it


keeps
 changing
 I
 mean
 you've
 2008
 we


were
 40
 billion
 of
 AUM
 in
 fact
 almost


every
 other
 large
 firm
 in
 our
 industry


today
 was
 roughly
 the
 same
 size
 and
 then


13
 14
 years
 later
 we're
 now
 up
 to
 over


700
 billion
 of
 AUM
 something
 changed


it's
 clearly
 not


as
 a
 result
 of
 our
 skill
 and
 talent
 we


had
 to
 be
 in
 the
 mainstream
 well
 skill


and
 talent
 helps
 right
 well
 look
 the


skill
 and
 talent
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 we're


positioned
 with
 Tailwinds
 behind
 us
 by


positioning
 the
 business
 the
 right
 way


but
 fundamental
 change
 is
 ultimately


what
 powered
 our
 business
 what
 does
 it


take
 to
 start
 the
 firm
 it
 it
 takes
 a


little
 bit
 of
 luck
 look
 I
 had
 spent
 the


prior
 six
 years
 from
 84
 until
 90


mastering
 my
 craft
 so
 clearly
 I
 knew


something
 about
 business
 but
 one
 has
 to


be
 humble
 and
 actually
 accept
 that


there's
 a
 fair
 degree
 of
 luck
 because
 I


was
 actually
 quite
 happy
 doing
 what
 I


was
 doing
 at
 Drexel
 Burnham
 in
 some
 ways


the
 single
 best
 thing
 that
 ever
 happened


to
 me
 was
 to
 be
 forced
 to
 make
 a
 change


Mark
 there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 focus
 on
 how


you
 are
 replacing
 Banks
 through
 direct


deals
 with
 uh
 with
 companies
 now
 what


kind
 of
 um
 business
 are
 you
 uh
 in
 a
 way


taking
 away
 from
 them
 or
 uh
 doing


instead
 of
 them
 well
 I
 think
 it's


actually
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 misnomer
 the
 Press


likes
 to
 report
 on
 this
 notion
 of
 Banks


and
 investors
 fighting
 over
 private


credit
 but
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 start
 with


a
 definition
 what
 is
 private
 credit
 well


for
 most
 people
 it
 means
 lever
 lending


or
 direct
 lending
 which
 is
 a
 below


investment
 grade
 activity
 and
 yes
 it
 is


true
 that
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 levered


loans
 used
 to
 be
 originated
 in
 the


banking
 system
 and
 now
 they
 are
 split


between
 being
 originated
 in
 the
 banking


system
 and
 being
 originated
 in
 the
 the


investment
 Marketplace
 and
 yes
 we
 are


engaged
 in
 that
 business
 but
 it
 is
 a


very
 small
 part
 of
 our
 business
 I
 think


generally
 financial
 pundants
 and
 other


Market
 participants
 are
 M
 missing
 the


bigger
 Trend
 to
 me
 private
 credit


encompasses
 almost
 every
 asset
 on
 a
 bank


balance
 sheet
 a
 loan
 to
 a
 customer


private
 a
 loan
 to
 a
 company
 private
 a


loan
 to
 a
 project
 private
 and
 so
 on
 and


so
 on
 and
 the
 vast
 vast
 majority
 of


private
 credit
 is
 investment
 grade
 so
 we


look
 and
 now
 say
 are
 we
 replacing
 the


banks
 generally
 not
 absolutely
 now
 we


are
 only
 in
 the
 public
 market
 right
 it's


not
 in
 our
 mandate
 to
 be
 in
 the
 private


Market
 what
 are
 we
 losing
 out
 on
 you're


losing
 out
 on
 80%
 of
 the
 investable


market
 and
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it
 public


markets
 do
 not
 work
 the
 way
 we
 think


they
 work
 in
 fact
 nothing
 works
 the
 way


we
 think
 it
 works
 so
 I
 look
 at
 public


markets
 today
 and
 I
 ask
 really


fundamental
 questions
 like
 in
 the
 US


which
 is
 the
 most
 developed
 of
 the


capital
 markets
 do
 we
 have
 price


Discovery
 in
 the
 short
 term


I
 don't
 think
 so
 think
 about
 what's


happened
 in
 US
 markets
 80%
 of


volume
 S&P
 500
 60
 plus%
 of
 the
 market


passive
 10
 stocks
 39%
 of
 the
 S&P
 four


stocks
 have
 determined
 basically


profitability
 for
 the
 last
 four
 years


yeah
 one
 stock
 is
 larger
 than
 every


Public
 Market
 other
 than
 Japan
 that's


the
 universe
 you're
 going
 into
 so
 you


saying
 that
 um
 the
 public
 market
 is
 very


risky
 I'm
 not
 saying
 it's
 risky
 I'm


saying
 it's
 indexed
 and
 correlated
 and


it
 is
 about
 cap
 Capital
 flows
 now
 it
 is


not
 about
 price
 discovery
 of
 an


individual
 security
 in
 the
 short
 term


think
 about
 people
 who
 are
 supposed
 to


be
 able
 to
 outperform
 the
 index
 active


managers
 how
 have
 active
 managers
 done


well
 basically
 90
 plus
 perc
 of
 the
 time


for
 the
 past
 20
 years
 they
 have
 failed


to
 beat
 the
 index
 did
 they
 get


stupider
 no
 the
 structure
 of
 our
 Market


has
 changed
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 bad
 it
 just


means
 indexed
 and
 correlated
 and
 so
 an


investor
 particularly
 an
 international


investor
 who
 wants
 to
 express
 an
 opinion


in
 the
 US
 no
 longer
 comes
 in
 and
 buys
 a


basket
 of
 Securities
 they
 buy
 the


index
 I
 think
 investors
 including


institutions
 like
 yours
 you
 may
 not
 own


private
 Equity
 but
 you
 will
 own
 Equity


that
 is
 private
 you
 you
 may
 or
 and
 many


do
 already
 they
 own
 Spotify
 they
 own


open
 AI
 they
 own
 any
 number
 of
 tech


companies
 that
 have
 remained
 private


well
 why
 should
 it
 stop
 there
 I
 think


there'll
 be
 or
 100
 companies
 that
 are


private
 for
 which
 Equity
 can
 be
 raised


maybe
 that
 is
 the
 new
 form
 of
 active


management
 active
 ownership
 of
 companies


or
 PE
 without
 the
 leverage
 and
 without


the
 fund
 that's
 that's
 a
 ways
 out
 still


the
 next
 five
 years
 is
 going
 to
 be
 about


fixed
 income


replacement
 is
 there
 such
 a
 thing
 as
 an


Apollo
 investment
 philosophy
 there
 is


it's
 and
 I
 I've
 said
 it
 it's
 purchase


price
 matters
 so
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 this


is
 so
 there
 are
 lots
 of
 strategies
 that


one
 can
 employ
 there's
 someone
 who's
 a


great
 great
 internationalist
 there's


someone
 who's
 a
 great
 macr
 Trader


there's
 someone
 who's
 great
 at
 chasing


growth
 we
 are
 great
 at
 finding


value
 sometimes
 that
 value
 comes
 from


Trading
 hard
 work
 for
 purchase
 price
 as


in
 our
 private
 Equity
 portfolio
 and


asset
 management
 but
 if
 you
 translate
 it


over
 to
 fixed
 income
 it's
 finding
 excess


return
 per
 unit
 of
 risk
 so
 how
 do
 we
 get


paid
 more
 for
 a
 single
 a
 rated
 company


from
 a
 single
 a
 rated
 company
 than
 they


could
 otherwise
 get
 in
 the
 public
 market


Marketplace
 has
 it
 ever
 been
 difficult


to
 stay
 true
 to
 the
 philosophy
 oh
 it's


been
 very
 difficult
 uh
 especially
 when


the
 US
 is
 printing
 8
 trillion
 dollars


over
 a
 period
 of
 time
 and
 random


companies
 have
 multi-billion
 dollar


valuations
 overnight
 so
 what
 do
 you
 do


now
 then
 uh
 what
 do
 you
 do
 then
 you
 you


try
 to
 manage
 a
 lot
 of
 type
 A


personalities
 and
 convince
 them
 that


doing
 nothing
 is
 the
 best


thing
 so
 this
 is
 the
 time
 where
 you're


holding
 back
 a
 bit
 we're
 definitely


holding
 back
 in
 adjusting
 how
 we
 invest


right
 now
 we
 want
 returns
 so
 if
 I
 give


you
 the
 credit
 Market
 return
 reaching


down
 the
 capital
 structure
 and
 taking


more
 subordinated
 risk
 feels
 like
 a
 bad


bad
 idea
 today
 right
 using
 your
 people


and
 your
 resources
 to
 get
 paid
 for


origination
 and
 structure
 but
 being


senior
 in
 the
 capital
 structure
 feels


like
 a
 tremendously
 good
 use
 of
 time


right
 and
 that's
 what
 we've
 been
 doing


what
 are
 the
 main
 risks
 in
 these


markets
 and
 what
 what
 could
 trigger


something
 more
 more
 serious
 so
 I
 look
 at


the
 risk
 today
 look
 the
 the
 risks
 in


front
 of
 us
 in
 in
 some
 way
 are
 obvious


we
 have
 geopolitics
 as
 one
 of
 the
 most


overriding
 risk
 but
 not
 even
 geopolitics


politics
 I
 mean
 we
 right
 now
 in
 the
 US
 I


will
 tell
 you
 things
 feel
 great
 not
 only


do
 we
 have
 growth
 and
 we
 have
 very
 low


unemployment
 we
 have
 a
 backlog
 of
 fiscal


stimulus
 that
 hasn't
 even
 hit
 yet
 three


years
 ago
 we
 passed
 nearly
 two
 trillion


in
 infrastructure
 bill
 it's
 still
 being


built
 nothing's
 built
 yet
 two
 years
 ago


$52
 billion
 for
 Semiconductor
 plants
 not


a
 single
 plant
 is
 open
 yet
 a
 year
 ago


inflation
 reduction
 act
 to
 encourage


manufacturing
 of
 EVs
 and
 other
 things


here
 not
 a
 single
 plant
 open
 last
 three


years
 in
 a
 row
 we've
 been
 the
 largest


recipient
 of
 foreign
 direct
 investment


and
 we're
 ramping
 defense
 production
 all


of
 those
 things
 are
 fiscally
 stimulative


against
 a
 backdrop
 of
 no
 legal


immigration
 that
 is
 a
 pretty
 good
 setup


we've
 raised
 rates
 500
 basis
 points
 what


happened
 home
 prices
 went
 up
 stocks
 went


up
 Capital
 markets
 are
 fully
 liquid
 this


is
 a
 pretty
 good
 setup
 oh
 by
 the
 way


we're
 we're
 have
 a
 $2
 trillion
 deficit


in
 peace
 time
 with
 a
 4%


unemployment
 that's
 a
 worry
 so
 one
 can


look
 at
 geopolitics
 one
 can
 look
 at


politics
 or
 governance
 as
 another
 and


how
 how
 big
 a
 warri
 is
 the
 deficit
 to
 me


um
 it
 doesn't
 it's
 not
 a
 short-term


worry
 but
 it
 is
 ultimately
 a
 long-term


worry
 how
 do
 you
 cope
 with
 stress
 I


don't
 find
 the
 job
 tremendously


stressful


I
 literally
 believe
 we
 are
 the
 luckiest


people
 in
 the
 world
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do


this
 this
 the
 slogan
 we
 have
 here
 is
 we


get
 to
 do
 this
 anytime
 someone
 tells
 me


in
 The
 Firm
 they
 don't
 like
 what
 they're


doing
 it's
 time
 for
 them
 to
 have
 another


job
 within
 the
 Apollo
 system
 or
 to
 find


something
 else
 to
 do
 if
 you
 come
 in


pretty
 often
 and
 you
 don't
 think
 I
 get


to
 do
 this
 this
 is
 not
 the
 right
 job
 for


you
 I
 get
 to
 do
 this
