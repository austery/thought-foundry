So
 we
 have
 uh
 at
 this
 moment
 I
 think
 we


just
 cracked
 $18
 trillion
 in
 commitments


and
 investments
 in
 our
 country.
 Uh
 as
 an


example
 the
 last
 administration
 was
 far


less
 than
 1
 trillion
 for
 four
 years.


We're
 at
 plus
 18
 trillion
 for
 8
 months.


There's
 never
 been
 anything
 like
 it
 in


history
 in
 any
 country
 anywhere
 in
 the


world.
 So
 that's
 great.
 But
 maybe
 for


purposes
 of
 this,
 more
 importantly,


we're
 going
 to
 bring
 drug
 prices
 down
 at


numbers
 that
 nobody
 ever
 thought


possible.
 Done.
 I
 think
 nobody
 ever
 even


thought
 it
 was
 possible.
 So,
 we're
 going


to
 be
 doing
 a
 lot
 of
 business,
 but
 we're


going
 to
 be
 uh
 also
 uh
 numbers
 that
 uh


when
 you're
 2
 3
 4
 500%
 less.
 I
 just


noticed
 one
 of
 them
 over
 here.
 654%


discount.
 654.


The
 lagard
 is
 98%.


Right.


Nine
 is
 that
 what?
 Wow.
 It's
 96.
 96
 230%


but
 654.
 And
 we
 have
 some
 that
 top
 that


by
 a
 lot.
 So
 it's
 uh
 it's
 really
 going


to
 be
 incredible.
 And
 that's
 going
 to
 be


so
 good
 for
 Medicaid
 and
 Medicare
 and


everything
 frankly
 for
 your
 life.
 It's


going
 to
 be
 so
 good.
 So
 nobody
 ever


thought
 they
 were
 going
 to
 see.
 And


don't
 let
 Democrats
 take
 the
 credit


because
 you
 know
 they'll
 try.
 They'll


say,
 "Oh,
 we
 worked
 so
 hard
 and
 they


didn't
 work
 hard.
 They
 did
 uh
 they


obstructed.
 they
 actually
 did
 the


opposite.
 So
 that's
 really
 more


important
 than
 even
 the
 tremendous


investments
 being
 made
 in
 our
 country.


But
 think
 of
 it,
 we
 cracked
 uh
 $18


trillion
 with
 a
 t
 trillion
 dollars
 and


uh
 frankly
 one
 trillion
 for
 four
 years


wasn't
 that
 bad.
 He
 did
 less
 than
 a


trillion,
 but
 we
 did
 that
 in
 a
 period
 of


eight
 months.
 So
 it's
 pretty
 pretty


record
 shattering
 by
 by
 many
 trillions


of
 dollars.
 Any
 country,
 no
 matter
 what


country
 you're
 talking
 about,
 nobody's


done
 numbers
 like
 that.
 So,
 thank
 you


all
 for
 being
 here.
 Do
 you
 want
 to
 have


a
 couple
 of
 questions?
 Yeah,
 please.


Mr.
 President,
 one
 on
 this
 if
 I
 could,


one
 on
 China
 if
 I
 may.
 Um,
 first
 on


this,
 could
 you
 have
 brought
 these


pharmaceutical
 companies
 to
 the
 table


without
 that
 100%
 tariff
 that
 you


imposed?


Well,
 it's
 not
 100%.
 You're
 talking


about
 China
 might
 be


I'm
 talking
 about
 the
 100%
 you
 imposed


on
 pharmaceuticals
 for
 that
 section.


I
 would
 never
 have
 been
 able
 to
 bring


them.
 Now,
 I'm
 not
 sure
 that
 Pascal


would
 like
 to
 say,
 but
 behind
 the


scenes,
 he
 did
 say
 tariffs
 were
 a
 big


reason
 he
 came
 here.
 And
 also
 the
 fact


he
 loved
 Virginia,
 he
 liked
 this
 guy.
 He


liked
 me.
 Uh
 I
 think
 the
 November
 5th


election
 was
 a
 very
 important
 date.
 We


had
 a
 good
 election.
 And
 uh
 that
 was


important.
 But
 yeah,
 he
 he's
 here.
 A
 lot


of
 a
 lot
 of
 I
 can
 speak
 for
 almost


everybody
 that's
 here.
 Most
 of
 them
 are


here
 because
 of
 tariffs.
 Because
 you


have
 to
 understand
 he
 has
 no
 tariffs.
 If


you
 build
 in
 this
 country,
 there
 are
 no


tariffs.
 So,
 let


me
 ask
 you
 about
 China
 if
 I
 could.
 Um,


just
 want
 to
 confirm,
 have
 you
 canled


your
 meeting
 with
 President
 Xi?
 And


no,
 I
 haven't
 cancelled,
 but
 I
 don't


know
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 it,
 but


I'm
 going
 to
 be
 there
 regardless.
 So,
 I


would
 assume
 we
 might
 have
 it.
 But,
 uh,


you
 know,
 they
 uh
 hit
 the
 world
 with


something
 that
 really
 is
 not
 anything


that
 people
 are
 going
 to
 do.
 And,
 and


it's,
 uh,
 it
 was
 shocking.
 And
 I
 can


tell
 you
 Howard
 and
 I
 and
 Todd,
 we
 all


we
 all
 Scott
 were
 all
 speaking
 about
 it


before
 and
 it
 was
 we
 said,
 "Where
 did


that
 come
 from?"
 It
 was
 just
 that
 was


out
 of
 the
 blue,
 right?
 Out
 of
 the
 blue,


they
 came
 up
 with
 this
 uh
 whole
 import


export
 concept
 and
 nobody
 uh
 nobody
 knew


anything
 about
 it.
 So


if
 they
 roll
 back
 their
 export
 controls,


the
 new
 announcement,
 would
 you
 roll


back?


Look,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 what


happens.
 That's
 why
 I
 made
 it
 November


1st.
 We'll
 see
 what
 what
 happens.
 Yeah,


Mr.
 President,
 the
 last
 time,
 Mr.


President,
 go
 ahead,
 please.


What
 else
 besides
 software
 could
 be
 on


the
 table
 in
 terms
 of
 export
 control?


A
 lot
 more
 a
 lot
 more.
 I
 mean,
 you
 have


you
 have
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 more.
 We
 have


airplanes.
 We
 have
 airplane
 parts.
 You


remember
 that
 from
 last
 time?
 And
 we


were
 just
 surprised
 that
 China
 have
 a


very
 good
 relationship
 with
 President
 Xi


and
 they
 did
 that.
 This
 is
 not
 something


that
 I,
 you
 know,
 instigated.
 This
 was


just
 a
 response
 to
 something
 that
 they


did.
 And
 they
 didn't
 really
 aim
 it
 at


us.
 They
 aimed
 it
 at
 the
 whole
 world.


The
 whole
 world
 is
 uh
 is
 subject
 to
 it.


So
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 very
 very
 bad.
 But


we
 have
 many
 things
 including
 a
 big


thing
 is
 airplane.
 They
 have
 a
 lot
 of


Boeing
 planes
 and
 they
 need
 parts
 and


lots
 of
 things
 like
 that.
 Steve,


how
 did
 you
 persuade
 Israeli
 Prime


Minister
 to
 to
 accept
 the
 Gaza
 deal
 and


what
 will
 be
 your
 message
 to
 the
 commens


when
 you
 speak
 to
 him?


Well,
 he
 wanted
 it.
 You
 know,
 it's
 been


a
 long
 time.
 He's
 been
 fighting
 a
 long


time.
 He's
 been
 fighting
 hard.
 He
 wanted


it.
 It's
 a
 great
 deal
 for
 Israel,
 but


it's
 a
 great
 deal
 for
 everybody,
 for


Arabs,
 for
 Muslims,
 for
 everybody,
 for


the
 world.
 And
 as
 you
 know,
 on
 Monday,


the
 hostages
 come
 back.
 They're
 getting


them
 now.
 I
 mean,
 they're
 getting
 them


now.
 They're
 in
 some
 uh
 pretty
 rough


places


under
 Earth.
 They're
 in
 some
 pretty


rough
 places
 where
 only
 a
 few
 people


know
 where
 they
 are
 some
 cases.
 So,


they're
 getting
 them.
 And
 they're
 also


getting
 the
 bodies.
 uh
 approximately
 28


bodies
 and
 uh
 some
 of
 those
 bodies
 are


uh
 being
 unearthed
 right
 now
 as
 we


speak.
 I
 mean,
 they're
 working
 on
 it


right
 now
 as
 we
 speak.
 It's
 it's
 a


tragedy.
 It's
 a
 tragedy.
 No,
 he
 was
 very


happy
 with
 it.
 And
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 that
 I


saw
 Israel
 dancing
 in
 the
 streets,
 but


they
 were
 dancing
 in
 Qatar
 and
 Saudi


Arabia
 and
 UAE
 and
 many,
 many
 countries.


Uh
 I
 saw
 Egypt,
 they
 were
 dancing.
 I'll


be
 going
 to
 Israel.
 I'll
 be
 speaking
 at


the
 Knesset


uh
 I
 think
 early
 on
 and
 then
 I'm
 also


going
 to
 Egypt.
 They
 were
 terrific.
 But


all
 of
 the
 countries
 were
 great.


Indonesia
 was
 great.
 Jordan
 was
 great.


They're
 all
 great.
 Everybody
 Everybody


wants
 this
 deal
 to
 happen.


What
 happens
 in
 Gaza
 the
 day
 after
 the


hostage
 release?


Day
 after
 what?


The
 day
 after
 the
 hostage
 release.
 What


happens
 there
 then?
 Well,
 hopefully


you're
 going
 to
 have
 great
 success
 for
 I


call
 it
 everlasting
 success.
 I
 think
 you


will,
 too.
 I
 think
 uh
 I
 think
 you're


going
 to
 have
 tremendous
 success
 and


Gaza
 is
 going
 to
 be
 rebuilt
 and
 you
 have


some
 very
 wealthy
 countries,
 as
 you


know,
 over
 there.
 And
 it
 would
 take
 a


small
 fraction
 of
 their
 their
 wealth
 to


do
 that,
 but
 and
 I
 think
 they
 want
 to
 do


it.
 And
 we're
 also
 we're
 also
 setting


up,
 as
 you
 know,
 a
 board
 of
 peace.
 It's


called
 the
 board
 of
 peace.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 that's
 the
 final
 name,
 but
 the
 word


peace
 is
 definitely
 in
 there.
 And
 they


asked
 me
 if
 I
 chair
 it.
 We'll
 make
 sure


things
 go
 well.


And
 how
 confident
 are
 you
 that
 the


ceasefire
 will
 hold?


I
 think
 it'll
 hold.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 it'll


hold.
 Uh
 they're
 all
 tired
 of
 the


fighting.
 Don't
 forget
 uh
 you
 had


October
 7th,
 which
 was
 a
 horrible
 day.


1,200
 people
 killed.
 Uh
 but
 uh
 Hamas
 has


lost
 58,000
 people.
 That's
 big


retribution.
 That's
 big
 retribution.


People
 understand
 that.
 So,
 no,
 I
 think


they're
 they're
 all
 tired
 of
 fighting


and
 this
 really
 gives
 the
 whole
 Middle


East,
 this
 is
 beyond
 Gaza.
 Gaza
 is
 very


important,
 but
 this
 is
 beyond
 Gaza.
 This


is
 peace
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.
 And
 it
 is
 a


beautiful
 thing.
 You
 know,
 it's
 a
 term


that
 you
 and
 I
 have
 been
 hearing
 since


we
 were
 very
 young,
 right?
 And
 now
 we


have
 a
 chance
 of
 really
 having
 that.
 And


as
 you
 know,
 most
 of
 the
 countries
 have


passed
 all
 these
 resolutions.
 Every


country
 is
 there.
 Iran
 uh
 came
 in.
 And
 I


was
 very
 happy
 to
 see
 that.
 I
 was
 very


honored
 that
 Iran
 came
 in.
 They
 said


they
 support
 it.
 Russia
 came
 in.


President
 Putin,
 he
 supports
 it
 fully.


Very
 fully.
 So
 I
 was
 happy
 to
 see
 even


countries
 that
 weren't
 necessarily


involved
 in
 the
 process.
 They
 all


support
 it.
 Every
 I
 don't
 know
 of


anybody
 that
 doesn't.
 And
 I've
 never


seen
 happier
 people
 than
 many
 of
 these


places,
 not
 just
 Israel.
 Many
 of
 these


places.
 They're
 all
 dancing
 in
 the


streets.
 I've
 never
 seen
 anything
 like


it.


Mr.
 President,
 please
 in
 the
 back.


Thank
 you.
 Um,
 what
 guarantee
 did
 you


give
 Hamas
 to
 persuade
 them
 that
 Israel


will
 restart
 the
 bombing
 campaign
 once


the
 hostages
 have
 been
 exchanged?


What
 did
 I
 do
 with
 respect
 to
 them?


Well,
 you
 know,
 I
 spoke
 a
 little
 bit


tough
 and
 that's
 what
 would
 happen.
 I


mean,
 you
 have
 to
 speak
 tough.
 It's
 a


that's
 a
 tough
 world.
 That's
 a
 tough,
 as


they
 say,
 neighborhood.
 And
 uh
 they're


tough
 people.
 They're
 very
 tough
 people


and
 they're
 smart
 people.
 Uh
 they're


good
 negotiators.
 you
 know,
 they
 have
 a


lot
 of
 things
 going.
 They
 put
 that
 to


good
 use.
 They're
 going
 to
 be
 very,
 very


successful.
 But,
 uh,
 they
 knew
 the


retribution
 would
 be
 tremendous,


unsustainable.


It
 would
 have
 been
 unsustainable.


Would
 have
 been
 it
 would
 have
 been


complete
 obliteration.
 And
 uh,
 they


didn't
 want
 that.
 And
 nobody
 wants
 it
 at


this
 point.
 They
 want
 to
 get
 on
 with,


you
 know,
 rebuilding
 the
 entire
 Middle


East.
 It's
 not
 only
 Gaza,
 it's
 going
 to


be
 the
 entire
 Middle
 East.
 uh
 they're


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 live
 in
 peace.
 Now,


we
 have
 some
 little
 hot
 spots,
 but


they're
 very
 small.
 You
 know
 the
 ones


I'm
 talking
 about.
 They're
 very
 small.


They'll
 be
 very
 easy
 to
 put
 out.
 Those


fires
 are
 going
 to
 be
 put
 out
 very


quickly.
 Yes,
 ma'am.


Thank
 you,
 Mr.
 President.
 Um
 talking


about
 the
 Middle
 East,
 still
 going
 to


the
 phases
 that
 come
 after
 this
 first


phase.
 Is
 there
 consensus
 on
 the


additional
 points
 in
 your
 plan
 or
 are


the
 details
 still
 being
 fine
 tuned?
 I


think
 there
 is
 consensus
 on
 most
 of
 it


and
 some
 of
 the
 details
 like
 anything


else
 will
 be
 worked
 out
 because
 you'll


find
 out
 that
 when
 you're
 sitting
 in
 a


beautiful
 room
 in
 Egypt
 uh
 you
 know
 it's


easier
 to
 work
 something
 out
 but
 then


sometimes
 it
 doesn't
 work
 from
 a


practical
 standpoint.
 So
 certain
 little


things
 but
 for
 the
 most
 part
 there's


consensus.
 Yes.
 Do


you
 intend
 to
 hash
 that
 out
 when
 you're


in
 Egypt?


I
 I
 might.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 I'll
 be
 there


because
 I'll
 be
 going
 to
 I
 think
 we'll


I'll
 go
 to
 Cairo.
 I
 think
 that's
 where


we're
 going
 as
 opposed
 to
 the
 place
 of


the
 signing
 and
 we
 have a
 lot
 of
 leaders


from
 all
 over
 the
 world
 coming
 to
 you


know
 they've
 been
 invited
 and
 then
 I'm


coming
 back
 I
 believe
 it's
 Tuesday
 night


for
 Charlie
 Kirk
 friend
 of
 mine
 a
 friend


of
 all
 of
 ours
 in
 front
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 the


people
 right
 here
 and
 we're
 giving
 him


the
 Presidential
 Medal
 of
 Freedom
 which


is
 the
 highest
 honor
 you
 get
 outside
 of


the
 Congressional
 Medal
 of
 Honor.
 one's


military,
 one's
 uh
 civilian,
 but
 it's


it's
 the
 greatest
 honor.
 And
 uh
 Erica's


beautiful
 wife
 is
 going
 to
 be
 here,
 and


a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 going
 to
 be
 here.


So,
 you
 know,
 it's
 not
 easy
 for
 me
 to


get
 back.
 It's
 it's
 a
 very
 quick
 trip,


but
 I'll
 be
 making
 two
 major
 stops,
 and


then
 I'll
 be
 on
 the
 plane
 trying
 to
 get


back
 in
 in
 time
 for
 Charlie.
 They're


going
 to
 have
 a
 a
 great
 celebration
 at


the
 White
 House
 in
 the
 East
 Room
 of
 the


White
 House.


Mr.
 President


um
 Russell
 Vog
 said
 the
 the
 reductions


in
 force
 have
 begun
 related
 to
 this


shutdown.
 How
 many
 layoffs
 have
 you


authorized
 for
 this
 first
 round
 and
 from


which
 agencies?


And
 it'll
 be
 Democrat
 oriented
 because


we
 figure
 you
 know
 they
 started
 this


thing
 so
 they
 should
 be
 Democrat


oriented.
 It'll
 be
 a
 lot
 and
 we'll


announce
 the
 numbers
 over
 the
 next


couple
 of
 days
 but
 it'll
 be
 a
 lot
 of


people
 all
 because
 of
 the
 Democrats.
 I


mean
 they
 want
 to
 give
 $1.5
 trillion


dollars
 to
 people
 that
 came
 into
 the


country
 illegally.
 more
 important
 than


that
 because
 we
 all
 have
 a
 big
 heart.
 We


want
 people
 to
 be
 taken
 care
 of.
 But
 you


know,
 we
 have
 zero
 people
 coming
 in.
 You


know
 that,
 Glenn,
 right?
 That's
 that's
 a


pretty
 impressive
 number
 even
 for
 a


successful
 governor.
 But
 we've
 had
 for


the
 last
 four
 months
 zero
 people
 coming


in
 illegally.
 They're
 coming
 in,
 but


they're
 coming
 in
 legally.
 They're


coming
 in
 through
 a
 process
 that's


really
 a
 really
 good
 process
 right
 now


because
 we
 want
 people
 to
 come
 in,
 but


they
 have
 to
 come
 in
 legally.
 So
 what


we're
 doing
 is
 uh
 as
 uh
 as
 these


different
 groups
 come
 due,
 we're
 going


to
 make
 a
 determination.
 Do
 we
 want
 them


allow?
 And
 and
 I
 must
 tell
 you,
 a
 lot
 of


them
 happen
 to
 be
 uh
 Democrat
 oriented.


These
 are
 uh
 people
 that
 the
 Democrats


wanted
 that
 in
 many
 cases
 were
 uh
 not


appropriate.
 We
 fought
 them
 at
 the
 time


and
 it
 was
 ultimately
 uh
 signed
 in.
 And


some
 of
 these
 people,
 these
 are
 largely


people
 that
 the
 Democrats
 want.
 Many
 of


them
 will
 be
 fired.
 Yes,
 please.
 Behind.


Yeah.
 Um
 the
 the
 Nobel
 Peace
 Prize
 was


announced
 this
 morning.
 Your
 thoughts?


Which
 one?


The
 Nobel
 Peace
 Prize.
 You
 want
 your


thoughts?


Look,
 I
 I
 including


a
 very
 big
 one.
 And
 I'm
 not
 sure
 you


know
 when
 you
 say
 big,
 it's
 certainly
 I


think
 to
 the
 mind
 of
 most
 the
 most


important
 deal
 ever
 made
 in
 terms
 of


peace.
 Uh
 but
 the
 one
 we
 just
 signed,


it's
 been
 signed,
 sealed,
 and
 it's
 uh


going
 to
 start
 taking
 place
 now.
 It's


already
 started.
 Monday
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


very
 big
 day
 when
 the
 hostages
 come


back.
 But
 uh
 I
 made
 eight


deals,
 transactions
 of
 wars.
 One
 was
 31


years
 going
 on.
 10
 million
 people
 were


killed.
 One
 was
 34
 years,
 one
 was
 36,


37.
 Uh
 one
 was
 10,
 one
 was
 just


starting.
 Two
 were
 just
 starting


actually,
 but
 they
 were
 well
 on
 their


way.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 India
 and
 Pakistan,


seven
 planes
 were
 shot
 down.
 It
 was
 it


was
 a
 bad
 one.
 And
 I
 I
 did
 it
 largely


through
 trade.
 I
 mean
 that
 one
 numerous


of
 them
 uh
 I
 talked
 tariffs
 I
 said
 look


if
 you're
 going
 to
 do
 that
 we're
 going


to
 put
 very
 big
 tariffs
 on
 your
 country


and
 uh
 they
 were
 both
 great
 they
 they


stopped
 fighting
 and
 they
 were
 two


nuclear
 powers
 so
 you
 know
 they're
 all


big
 there
 every
 one
 of
 them
 big
 you
 take


of
 you
 take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 Congo
 you
 take


a
 look
 at
 the
 Congo
 and
 Rwanda
 uh
 10


million
 people
 killed
 over
 a
 long
 period


of
 time
 got
 that
 one
 solved
 we
 we
 did
 a


total
 of
 eight
 as
 of
 this
 two
 days
 ago
 I


would
 have
 said
 seven
 which
 I
 did
 say


but
 uh
 the
 other
 one
 was
 signed
 up


sealed
 as
 you
 know
 the
 uh
 Israel
 signed


it
 just
 now
 they
 signed
 it
 and
 they


approved
 it
 today
 their
 parliament
 and


uh
 it's
 a
 great
 honor
 to
 be
 involved


with
 so
 many
 so
 uh
 the
 person
 who


actually
 got
 the
 Nobel
 Prize
 uh
 called


today
 called
 me
 and
 said
 that
 I'm


accepting
 this
 in
 honor
 of
 you
 because


you
 really
 deserved
 it
 that
 a
 very
 nice


thing
 to
 do
 I
 I
 didn't
 I
 didn't
 say
 then


give
 it
 to
 me
 though
 because
 I
 think
 she


might
 have
 she
 was
 very
 nice
 and
 I've


been
 you
 know
 I've
 been
 helping
 her


along
 the
 way.
 She
 they've
 they
 need
 a


lot
 of
 help
 in
 Venezuela.
 It's
 a
 basic


disaster.
 So
 uh
 and
 you
 could
 also
 say


it
 was
 given
 out
 for
 24
 and
 I
 was


running
 for
 office
 in
 24.
 You
 know
 all


of
 the
 transactions
 that
 we
 did
 in
 terms


of
 closing
 but
 uh
 there
 are
 those
 that


say
 we
 did
 so
 much
 that
 they
 should
 have


done
 it.
 But
 I
 don't
 take
 I'm
 happy


because
 I
 saved
 millions
 of
 lives.
 Many


millions
 of
 lives.
 And
 speaking
 of


somebody
 that
 saves
 lives,
 don't
 ever


play
 golf
 with
 it
 because
 Keegan
 Bradley


just
 walked
 in.
 One
 of
 the
 greatest


golfers
 in
 the
 world,
 the
 captain
 of
 the


Rder
 Cup.
 And
 man,
 I'll
 tell
 you,
 you


did
 a
 good
 job.
 You
 almost
 came
 back.
 I


turned
 on.
 I
 said,
 you
 know,
 I
 sort
 of


turned
 off.
 It
 wasn't
 looking
 good.
 And


then
 a
 little
 while
 later,
 I
 turned
 on.


I
 said,
 you
 guys
 might
 make
 that
 would


have
 been
 the
 miracle.
 What
 a
 great
 job.


He's
 respected
 by
 those
 golfers
 like


nobody.
 And
 I
 just
 want
 to
 compliment


you,
 Keegan.
 There's
 a
 incredible
 job.


Right
 here,
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 unfriendly


fake
 news
 media.
 But
 and
 he's
 not
 used


to
 that.
 He's
 used
 to
 getting
 only
 good


publicity.
 I
 think
 Harry,
 these
 are
 all


golfers,
 but
 uh
 you're
 some
 golfer.
 I'll


tell
 you
 that.
 And
 some
 some
 leader.


Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Great
 job.
 Thank


you.


Mr.
 on
 China.


Yeah,
 please.


On
 immigration,
 um,
 ICE
 are
 making


arrests,
 targeted
 arrests
 at
 courouses


in
 New
 York
 City
 and
 around
 the
 country.


Arresting
 criminals.
 That's
 right.
 Yeah.


Go
 ahead.


I'm
 I'm
 happy
 about
 it.
 I
 want
 them
 to


arrest
 criminals.
 And,
 uh,
 if
 you
 take
 a


look
 at
 DC,
 uh,
 a
 year
 ago,
 DC
 was
 this


our
 great
 capital
 was
 a
 very
 unsafe


place.
 You
 know
 that
 some
 of
 you
 were


mugged
 and,
 uh,
 talk
 openly
 about
 it.


Some
 of
 the
 media
 was
 mugged.
 Uh
 but
 uh


right
 now
 DC
 is
 one
 of the
 safest
 places


in
 the
 whole
 country.
 Uh
 the
 restaurants


are
 booming.
 They're
 opening
 up
 new


restaurants.
 The
 restaurants
 were
 all


closing.
 Now
 you
 can't
 get
 into
 a


restaurant.
 They're
 opening
 up
 new


restaurants.
 Uh
 it
 took
 12
 days
 for
 us.


We
 sent
 in
 uh
 not
 politically
 correct


military.
 We
 sent
 them
 in
 based
 on


merit.
 You
 know,
 we
 won
 the
 case
 in
 the


Supreme
 Court.
 Everything
 now
 is
 based


on
 merit.
 Our
 country
 was
 founded
 on


things
 based
 on
 merit.
 Like
 uh
 Keegan


Bradley
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 playing
 golf


if
 he
 wasn't
 a
 great
 player.
 He
 if
 he


shoots
 lower
 scores
 it's
 boy
 there's
 no


more
 merit
 system
 than
 that
 one
 Keegan


right
 you
 the
 if
 you
 miss
 a
 putt
 you


they
 don't
 say
 oh
 that's
 okay
 let's
 take


it
 again
 do
 they
 no
 it's
 based
 on
 merit


everything's
 based
 on
 merit
 and
 uh
 we're


back
 to
 the
 merit
 system
 and
 when
 they


saw
 that
 military
 that
 military
 is
 all


about
 merit
 they're
 big
 strong
 people


that
 want
 to
 they're
 patriots
 too
 and


you
 take
 a
 look
 at
 DC
 and
 now
 we're
 in


Memphis
 and
 Memphis
 was
 really


crimeridden.
 It
 was
 terrible.
 A
 lot
 of


people
 being
 killed.
 And
 they
 say
 in
 12


days,
 they
 can't
 even
 believe
 how
 much


better
 it
 is.
 And
 it'll
 take
 uh
 probably


a
 month
 over
 there.
 And
 we're
 heading
 to


Chicago
 because
 we
 want
 to
 save
 Chicago.


Do
 you
 know
 they
 had
 over
 4,000
 people


killed
 in
 Chicago
 over
 a
 short
 4,000


people?
 And
 I
 have
 to
 watch
 this
 slob
 of


a
 governor
 stand
 up
 and
 say
 that
 well


everything's
 okay.
 We've
 got
 it
 under


control.
 They
 had
 4,000
 people
 murdered


over
 a
 very
 short
 period
 of
 time.
 That's


there's
 not
 a
 city
 in
 the
 world
 I
 don't


believe
 that
 can
 claim,
 you
 know,
 you


hear
 so
 much
 about
 different
 I
 won't,


you
 know,
 embarrass
 anybody
 like
 by


saying
 Mexico
 City
 or
 by
 saying
 anywhere


in
 Afghanistan.


There's
 no
 place
 like
 that.
 And
 then
 I


have
 to
 listen
 to
 the
 mayor
 who's
 got
 a


5%
 approval
 rate,
 maybe
 less.
 He's
 an


incompetent
 man.
 And
 the
 governor
 is
 an


incompetent
 guy.
 He's
 a
 guy
 that
 was


thrown
 out
 of
 his
 family
 business
 like
 a


dog.
 And
 it's
 I
 know
 his
 family
 very


well.
 And
 now
 he's
 a
 governor.
 And
 when


I
 watch
 him
 trying
 to
 say
 that
 it's


okay,
 we
 have
 crime
 under
 control.
 Lost


4,000
 people
 over
 a
 very
 short
 period
 of


time.
 Uh
 over
 I
 believe
 it's
 like
 six


7,000
 people
 were
 shot
 but
 didn't
 die.


But
 4,000
 people
 died.
 Uh,
 and
 then
 he


gets
 up
 and
 talks
 about
 how
 it's
 not
 a


problem.
 Or
 Portland,
 Oregon.
 I
 mean,


every
 time
 I
 look
 at
 that
 place,
 the


place
 is
 burning
 down.
 There's
 fires
 all


over
 the
 place.
 When
 a
 store
 owner,


there
 are
 very
 few
 of
 them
 left,
 but


when
 a
 store
 owner
 rebuilds
 a
 store,


they
 build
 it
 out
 of
 plywood.
 And
 they


don't
 put
 up
 storefronts
 anymore.
 They


just
 put
 wood
 up
 because
 they
 know
 it's


going to
 be
 ripped
 down.
 And
 then
 I
 hear


how
 wonderful
 it
 is.
 It's
 not
 wonderful.


It's
 a
 disaster.
 That's
 almost
 an


insurrection,
 that
 place.
 So,
 we
 put
 our


people
 in
 there
 and
 they
 do
 the
 job.
 and


they've
 really
 done
 the
 job.
 And
 the


beautiful
 thing
 is
 we've
 done
 it
 12
 days


we
 had
 this
 place
 safe
 and
 now
 it's
 uh
 I


would
 say
 within
 a
 month
 it
 was


beautiful
 and
 it
 continues
 to
 be
 that


was
 uh
 3
 months
 ago.
 I
 I'll
 tell
 you
 DC


now
 is
 one
 of
 the
 hottest
 places
 just


like
 this
 country.
 We
 were
 a
 dead


country
 and
 you've
 heard
 me
 say
 it
 a


hundred
 times.
 We're
 a
 dead
 country.


King
 of
 Saudi
 Arabia
 said
 it.
 Others
 say


the
 Amir
 of
 Qar
 said
 it.
 Many
 UAE
 said


it,
 the
 leader,
 great
 leader,
 UAE,
 all


great
 leaders,
 they
 said
 effectively
 the


same
 thing.
 One
 year
 ago,
 we
 had
 a
 dead


country.
 Now
 we
 have
 the
 hottest
 country


anywhere
 in
 the
 world.
 I
 just
 want
 to


thank
 everybody
 and
 I
 want
 to
 in


particular
 thank
 Astroenica.
 What
 a


great
 company
 you
 have.
 What
 a
 company


you've
 built.
 You've
 been
 there
 a
 long


time
 and
 done
 some
 job.
 It's
 an
 honor
 to


have
 you.
 I
 I
 assume
 you're
 going
 to


build
 so
 it's
 four
 4.5
 billion
 for
 a


plant.
 That's
 a
 pretty
 big
 plant,
 isn't


it?
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say,
 could
 he
 make
 it


a
 little
 bit
 more?
 Well,
 we
 have
 a


couple
 of
 them
 where
 they're
 going
 to


spend
 65
 billion
 on
 one
 plant.
 You
 know,


like
 AI,
 all
 I
 know
 is
 it's,
 you
 know,


AI
 is
 based
 on
 information.
 I
 hope


they're
 right
 about
 information.
 I
 don't


know.
 You
 got
 to
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 to


there's
 got
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 information


out
 there,
 but
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 pretty


hot,
 but
 we
 have
 a
 lot.
 We're
 we're


leading
 the
 world
 on
 information,
 on
 AI,


as
 you
 know,
 by
 a
 lot.
 It's
 not
 even


close.
 So,
 we're
 doing
 a
 job.
 And
 I
 want


to
 thank
 everybody,
 but
 in
 particular,


uh,
 Pascal,
 thank
 you
 very
 much.
 It's
 a


great
 honor.
 Thank
 you.


Thank
 you
 everybody.
 Have
 a
 good
 time.
