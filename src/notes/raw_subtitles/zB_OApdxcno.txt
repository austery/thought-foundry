There is this research paper
that has been on my mind for years.
It shows that there is a
particular type of problem
where the smarter you are,
the more likely you are to get it wrong.
So I asked my American friend
Wylie to go out on the street
and ask people the
questions from the study
to see if we could replicate its findings.
The first question in the paper
is about a fictitious study
on skin cream.
So in this made-up study,
people with skin rashes are assigned
to either the experimental group
where they use a new cream for two weeks,
or the control group
where they use no cream
for that same period.
And at the end, they count
up how many rashes improved
and how many got worse
in each treatment group.
The results are summarized in this table.
So the question study
participants were asked was-
- Did the skin cream make the rash better
or did it make it worse?
- [Derek] The question is a little tricky
because it requires
proportional reasoning,
- I think better.
- Better? So what are you looking at?
Just real quick.
- I'm gonna be honest.
I'm just looking at how
big the numbers are.
- [Derek] If you just look
for the biggest number,
well that is the group
who used the skin cream
and the rash improved.
- So this number is
bigger than this number?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- So you might conclude
that the cream worked,
it makes rashes better.
That is the intuitive answer.
But if you look more carefully at the data
and use proportional reasoning,
you realize that in the
experimental cream group,
about three times as many
people got better as got worse.
But in the control group,
around five times as many
people got better than worse.
So using no cream,
your rash was significantly
more likely to improve.
In fact, it's a fair conclusion to say
that the cream, on
average, made rashes worse.
The lead author on this
study was Dan Kahan.
- I'm Studying the science
of science communication.
- He and colleagues recruited
a nationally diverse sample
of 1,111 Americans to participate.
But before answering the
question on skin cream,
each participant was asked
a series of questions
to assess their numeracy.
- And numeracy, it's
not so much the capacity
to use complicated mathematics,
but really to reason well
about quantitative information.
- Numeracy scores for the
entire sample were roughly
normally distributed.
Now if you group together
all the participants
with a certain numeracy score,
say group all the zeros
together, all the ones together,
all the twos and so on.
Well, what fraction of each group
do you think got the skin
cream question right?
Well, the results are
exactly what you'd expect.
- Oh, this is math.
- It's math.
- In a fifth of the people,
which is a smaller number-
- Uh-huh.
- The rash worsened, so
the skin cream didn't help.
- So it didn't make it better?
- I feel the cream,
if anything, made it worse.
- [Derek] The higher the numeracy score,
the greater the fraction
of participants who got the answer right.
- Yeah. I don't think the
numbers mean anything to me
'cause I think I need-
- That's a perfect answer.
- I think I would need
to know what's the rash
and what's the cream you're giving me.
- [Derek] Those with
better numeracy skills
manage to avoid the
intuitively correct answer.
- What are the-
- Just seems like proportions.
- I've had nobody get into
the numbers like this.
This is great.
Excellent. You got that right.
- Okay.
- And correctly determine
that the cream actually made rashes worse,
which is no big surprise.
But this version of the skin
cream question was only shown
to some of the participants.
Another subset saw the same exact table
except the column headings were reversed.
So in this case, the skin cream
did make the rashes better.
So how did the different
numeracy groups do
with this version?
Well, again, the highest numeracy groups
were the most likely to
get the correct answer.
But below a numeracy score of five,
the results were pretty flat.
That could be because even
without any numerical reasoning,
most people might expect a
skin cream to improve a rash,
which just happens to be the
right answer in this case.
But the true purpose of the
study was not to find out
how numeracy effects our ability
to reason accurately with data.
No, it was to figure out if something else
affects our reasoning ability.
Specifically, politics.
(exciting music)
If you look at the skin cream data again,
but separate the participants
by their self-reported
political affiliations,
so liberal Democrats versus
conservative Republicans,
there's basically no
difference between the groups.
All follow the same pattern
irrespective of party,
which makes sense because a
study on skin cream is about
as apolitical as it gets.
But what the researchers
did with the other half
of the participants was the opposite.
Instead of skin cream,
they presented a fictitious
study on gun control.
In case you don't know,
Democrats generally believe
that gun control reduces crime,
whereas Republicans
believe it increases crime
because it takes guns outta
the hands of good guys
who could prevent or deter crime.
So in their made-up study,
the cities were divided into two groups,
those that had recently
enacted legislation
making it illegal to
carry a concealed handgun
and similar cities that
had no such legislation.
Over the following year,
crime rates were monitored
to see where crime increased
and where it decreased.
And the results are
summarized in the table.
Again, no surprise, it's exactly the same
as the skin cream example.
Of course, there were two variations,
one where gun control decreased crime
and one where it increased crime.
Now if you look at the
results by political leaning,
they paint a very different picture.
- It's kind of obvious, if
you have guns in a city,
people are gonna start shooting people.
And you know, if you don't have guns
and you outlaw them,
cities are obviously gonna
have less crime in 'em.
But the thing is, it's like you can't
just take people's guns away
and say that they're illegal.
You know, like that's just,
it's kinda like drugs.
- So wait, but these numbers though,
how did you just come to that conclusion?
- [Derek] When Republicans
are shown the table
where the correct answer is gun
control laws increase crime,
then the accuracy improves
with increasing numeracy, just as before.
But for the Republicans
who are shown the table
where gun control decreases crime,
well, numeracy skills no
longer affect accuracy.
Those with a numeracy score of seven
or eight are barely more
likely to answer correctly
than those with a score of zero or one.
- So where the crime improved,
like there can be crimes
that were prevented because
the guns were legal.
And the crimes that were worsened,
that could have been other
crimes like not related
to guns, you know?
- Mm-hm.
- And the same is true
in reverse for Democrats.
The more numerate people in
this sample have no problem
recognizing the correct
answer when it shows
that gun control reduced crime.
But, if the data showed that
gun control increased crime,
then all of a sudden numeracy didn't help.
Remember, this is the exact same data
and question as the skin cream example.
The only difference is now
that data is presented
in a political context.
- And the biggest
difference in performance
is among the most numerate people,
they're scoring a lot worse
than they should have.
The low numeracy people are
about 25 percentage points
less likely to get the right answer
if that answer is threatening
to their ideology,
than if it's consistent
with their ideology.
The people who are high in
numeracy, on the other hand,
45 percentage points less
likely to get the right answer.
- Rather than using their
mathematical ability
to come to the correct conclusion,
they somehow selectively apply it
to justify the conclusion they
already believed beforehand.
- Illegal guns, less crime.
- Illegal crime.
- Yeah, I mean,
I wouldn't have thought that.
- And as numeracy increases,
people are more divided about the efficacy
or the risks of gun control regulation.
The same thing with fracking,
and same thing with global warming.
We see the polarization
conditional on numeracy,
but we also see the same effect
when we measure people's
reasoning proficiency
in other ways.
The people who are high
in science literacy,
more polarized than
the people who are low.
The people who are high and
actively open-minded thinking,
you see more polarization, not less,
as they become more proficient
in this kind of thinking
- Based on this data, of
course I'd wanna look into it
and look at all the sources.
And of course there are
sources from sources
because people are always
citing each other, so yeah.
- This is, the numbers are
actually not real whatsoever.
- It looks, but, if I were to
look at this pragmatically,
I would just say
that the playing field
seems pretty even here.
- It's pretty even?
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.
- Now, everyone wants to
believe that they are rational,
that they could change their beliefs
in light of the evidence.
- If you encountered
evidence on a political issue
that you were like,
"This is good evidence.
I've done my research."
But it contradicted your
political belief on that issue,
how would you react to that?
- I'd consider myself to
be a little bit open-minded
in that aspect.
- At least be open to learning.
- Yeah.
- If it's on paper
and that's the way it is, I
would have to go with that.
- I'm gonna have to deal with it.
I can't be like, "Well, I
feel like it's different."
- All I see here are
people who will continue
to hold partisan beliefs
regardless of the evidence,
all the while deluding themselves
into thinking they came
to these beliefs via an independent,
sober consideration of the facts.
The truth is that mostly
we believe what we believe
to fit in with our tribe.
And that, in the most important
way, is highly rational.
Because humans are very social creatures,
and for most of our evolution,
we've depended on each other for survival.
Being ostracized from the
group is almost as bad
as walking off a cliff.
If we question the status quo by rejecting
what those around us accept as true,
we jeopardize our place in society.
- Man, I've learned that
people are not as dissimilar
as we think.
That there is so many
similarities between sides
that we think share nothing in common.
- I attended Zoom meetings
in the opposite party
and it was kind of scary
because they sounded just like my side.
- It makes you think about
what we could get done
if we didn't have that burden,
and I think it would be
a pretty different world
and pretty extraordinary if
we managed to figure that out.
- So what do we do about this?
Well, I don't think there
is an easy solution,
but Kahan has identified a
few angles that might work.
One is avoiding partisan rhetoric.
Rather than talk about gun
control or climate change,
avoid the loaded terms
and instead focus on
specific local policies.
No buzzwords that could trigger
anyone into tribal thinking.
No villainizing the other side,
just constructive solutions
that make sense given the data.
One example comes from southeast Florida
where a bipartisan group of
lawmakers have joined together
to take action on sea-level rise.
The plans don't debate
whether climate change is manmade or not.
They just deal with existing
challenges faced by residents.
The other thing is to
foster a curious mindset.
- Maybe the science curious people,
they're more willing to
examine all the evidence,
including information that's inconsistent
with their political ideology.
- With increasing science comprehension
usually comes increasing
polarization on political topics.
But with increasing science curiosity,
this same increase in
polarization is not observed.
That is a start.
I am not going to claim
to have the solution.
Problems of this sort are likely as old
as the human species itself.
They are just much more obvious now
that everyone can post, tweet, comment
and basically shout loudly
into this nearly infinite digital space.
The only thing I hope to
do is bring some awareness.
The beliefs of most people are not formed
by a careful consideration of the data.
That includes me, and it
probably includes you.
Acknowledging this is
an important first step.

One organization that is
trying to tackle polarization
and our information echo
chambers is Ground News.
So we specifically asked
them to sponsor this video
because they gather news sources
from around the world in one spot
and show you any political
leaning they have.
That way you can read about the same issue
from different perspectives
with the context needed
to separate facts from politics.
For instance, the FBI
recently released statistics
about violent crime in the US.
This is a key political issue
that was referenced in
the presidential debate.
Most left-leaning outlets
focused on the 3% drop
in violent crime.
Some use this to counter Trump's claim
that crime is on the rise.
However, right-leaning sources
suggested crime increased
under Harris and Biden in
line with Trump's statements.
So how can we have such a disagreement?
Well, Ground News lets us dive deeper
into the reporting to uncover
that right-leaning sources referenced
a completely different
report, a DOJ survey.
And this survey collected data differently
and crucially, couldn't
include fatal crimes,
while the FBI statistics did.
Similarly, the FBI statistics
couldn't include unreported crimes
while the DOJ survey specifically does.
So we're comparing
apples and oranges here,
which is the source of the disagreement.
This kind of critical thinking is crucial
to keeping our biases in check
and so is personal accountability.
