- Many astronomers are really driven
by the search for Earth twins
because I think deep
down the natural endpoint
of this whole goal of looking for planets
is to answer the question: are we alone?
That is a burning itch that
I think many of us have
our entire lives wanted to answer.
I'm sure many of you feel
the same way as well.
So I think that was what really drives us.
But, you know, whenever
you have a temptation,
a goal, an aspiration
that you are reaching for,
it is so easy to get blindsided
and drawn into dark avenues
that aren't really true,
especially in science.
That can happen quite often.
And so we've already had several claims
of not only Earth-like
planets, but even life.
There's been claims of life on Venus.
There's been claims of life
on interstellar asteroids,
and, of course, there's many
UFOs that we often hear about.
So there is a natural
temptation to look at anything
that seems anomalous, that
seems a little bit different,
and immediately reach for aliens
because, of course, deep
down I think a lot of us
really want that to be the
answer, that we are not alone.
This drives us, it inspires us,
but it's always a risk
that we could go too far
into that temptation and see aliens
where there's none really there.
And we have fallen prey to that
trap many times in the past.

- [Announcer] The Search for Alien Life.
- One of the primary
tools that astronomers use
to think about the abundance
of life in the universe
is the famous Drake equation,
first written down by Frank Drake.
It is essentially the number
of stars in the galaxy
multiplied by a long
list of possible factors,
such as how often do you have planets?
How often are those planets Earth-like?
How often does life peak on those planets?
And so on and so on.
Now, when we look at this,
it's like a narrowing filter.
And you can imagine with
the Rare Earth hypothesis,
adding on extra term, such as having
how often does the
planet have a large moon?
How often does it have the
same mass as the earth?
How often does it have the
same land mass fraction
the Earth has?
Or the same ocean salinity? Or chemistry?
Et cetera, et cetera.
And you can imagine adding
on hundreds, even thousands
of extra parameters
onto the Drake equation,
which get ever, ever narrower.
And of course, if you
multiply a very large number
of fractions together,
you'll eventually get zero.
And I think this is one of my big problems
with the Rare Earth hypothesis is
that it's a very narrow
view of how life began
and how life must
survive on other planets.
All of these factors have to be true.
It is a singular path
and that is a path which
has indeed led to success.
But perhaps there are
different paths parallel to us
which are completely different,
yet also lead to life.
And so the Drake equation
simply multiplies fractions
by each other, but perhaps
truly what is missing
is an additive sign.
There is a second path below
it, a different way of getting
to intelligent civilization
and a different way
after that and a different way after that.
And so perhaps not only should we be
multiplying all those things,
but also adding up all
those power or tracks.
And it is that addition
that we just really can't do
without a lot of creativity and discovery
because right now we only have
this sole example to look at.
What is life though?
What are astronomers actually
ultimately hoping to detect?
Defining life is an
incredibly difficult task
and there is definitely
no consensus about how
to call such a thing.
Maybe it's actually better
to call it more, like porn,
like you will know it when you see it,
rather than having a strict
textbook definition of it.
NASA has certainly tried
to have a definition.
For a long time, we had
a definition from NASA
that said it is a
self-replicating chemical system
capable of Darwinian evolution.
And that's pretty good,
but maybe chemistry
isn't actually necessary.
Maybe you could have an AI system
or self-replicating technology
that would still resemble
life in many ways,
but wouldn't actually involve the kind
of chemical systems that
we are familiar with.
So whenever you come up with
one of these definitions,
it's really easy to poke holes in it
and say, "Well, what about
this? What about this?"
And I think it's just too
hard for us to come up
with a singular thing to
say this is exclusively
what life is until we've
discovered more examples of it.
That's the quest that we are on.
We're gonna look out, we're
gonna try and find examples
of things which resemble properties
of what life does, and
then we'll do the hard work
of truly trying to classify
what actually is life in the first place
and where do we draw our boundaries?
The necessary conditions
for life on a planet
are still for debate as well.
We really don't know exactly
where the limits of life are.
When we look at life on Earth,
there are some organisms,
especially extremophiles, that can cope
with fairly large ranges of conditions.
So for example, there's some thermophiles
that can range from
minus 25 degrees Celsius,
and you have other extremophiles,
which can live at 125 degrees Celsius.
So 150 degrees Celsius range of diversity.
But the fact that
extremophile today can survive
in such an extreme range of temperatures
doesn't mean that life could begin
under such an extreme
range of temperatures.
Maybe the nascent conditions
for the birth pangs of life
to begin with, the abiogenesis
event, the spark of life
which created all life on the Earth,
maybe that requires very special
and subtle temperature range
that cannot be violated,
and perhaps things as cold
as minus 25 degrees Celsius
are just way outside of that range.
These are questions we just don't know.
What were the initial
conditions on the Earth
that led to the emergence of life?
Similarly, we can't assume that just
because extremophiles on
Earth can only survive
from minus 25 to plus 125,
that means that life
elsewhere could not survive
under even more extreme conditions
because it could be based, of
course, on different chemistry
and use different thermodynamic rules
than the ones that our
life currently uses.
So there's a lot we don't know,
but I think the idea of just
narrowing in on the places
where liquid water could
survive, which is from zero
to 100 degrees Celsius, that
certainly makes a lot of sense
because even those
extremophiles still require
liquid water as some
part in their lifecycle
in order to survive.
So I would be comfortable with that
as an initial hunting ground with the idea
that we might perhaps extend that
to more diverse environments as we go on.
The Copernican principle named
after Nicholas Copernicus
also goes by the name of
the Mediocrity Principle,
and sometimes in cosmology is an extension
of it called the Cosmological Principle.
And all of these ideas
essentially say the same thing.
And that's the where
we are, where we live,
even when we live is typical.
Everything about us is normal
and therefore we should expect
that if we go to another
part of the universe,
it would look basically
the same as it does here.
And usually this is a
pretty good argument.
Take for example, the instance of Neptune.
We have a Neptune, in
fact, really two Neptunes
in our Solar System, Uranus and Neptune,
and they don't seem to
really play any part
and are any evolution
out there in the distant
part of the Solar System.
And so you might reason
if we have two of them,
perhaps other solar systems
should have them too,
by this mediocrity principle,
the idea that we are typical and normal,
and indeed that would be strikingly true.
When you look out at these
exoplanets, that's what we find.
We find Neptunes all over the place.
There are indeed a very
common type of planet.
But here's where it runs into problems.
Let's imagine we use the
Copernican principle to argue
that the Earth has an
oxygen rich atmosphere.
Therefore, all of the
planets in the Solar System
should have an oxygen rich atmosphere.
Or liquid water, whatever
you want to choose.
And of course, many features of the Earth
are incredibly unique and
special to the Earth itself
and are not found on any
of the Solar System planets
and perhaps not found
elsewhere in the universe too.
We just don't know.
And there's a good reason for that,
and it's called the weak
anthropic principle.
And the weak anthropic
principle basically points out
that you can only live in a place
where conditions are
suitable for you to live.
So it's not surprising that
we don't live on Pluto.
It's not surprising that we
don't live on a moon of Neptune
because those places are so cold,
they have very little atmosphere,
that, of course, a human being could never
have evolved on such a world.
We would, of course, live
on the only the subset
of exoplanets or planets in general
where the conditions were right for life.
And those conditions themselves
could be very, very rare.
Maybe there is only
three Earth-like planets
in the entire universe as far as we know.
It should not be surprising
that we find ourselves living
on one of those three
Earth-like exoplanets
because perhaps that is the
only place where we could live.
And all the other places are
just simply devoid of life.
So when we use the Copernican principle,
my big caveat would be,
look, it's okay to use it
when it has nothing to do with
our survival, our emergence.
Neptune, fine.
Neptune has nothing to
do with why we are here.
There's no way which Neptune
affects life on this planet.
But the moment you use it
in a case which is connected
to our existence, which is
predicated upon our existence,
such as maybe the presence of a large moon
or oceans on our planet, then
we have to be very careful.
I don't think in those
cases we can reliably use
the Copernican principle because if we do
in the Solar System, it clearly fails.
So in that case, I think
we should just take a beat
and really analyze how connected we are
to the statements that we are making.
And that's why I do not buy the argument
that by the Copernican
principle, life must be common.
It's kind of circular
statement, I would claim,
to make that argument.
One way that we have attempted
to classify hypothetical
alien civilizations
is with the so-called Kardashev scale.
So the Kardashev scale
basically splits civilizations
up by energy usage.
And maybe that's a somewhat archaic way
of thinking about it.
Today, I think maybe we might
think about capabilities
more than energy usage,
but this has still remained
a very persistent way
in which astronomers think about
how we might split up civilizations.
So a Kardashev Type I
civilization is defined
as a civilization which
uses all of the energy,
which is incident upon its planet.
And we are not there yet.
We do not have our planet
covered in solar panels
and use that amount of energy
that still greatly exceeds
our current global energy consumption.
A Type II civilization would
be one which not only uses
all the energy of the planet,
but uses all the energy of the star.
So you might imagine a Type
I civilization being able
to control their weather
and their climate,
but a Type II would be able to control
the entire Solar System.
They're able to move planets
and moons around at will as they needed.
And practically speaking, in
order to harvest all the energy
of a star, you probably
need to build some kind
of giant shell around that star,
often called a Dyson
sphere after Freeman Dyson
who first proposed that idea,
and that shell or swarm
of material would absorb
all of that starlight, which
you could use for whatever
you want to do:
computation, manufacturing,
whatever advanced purposes
these civilizations might
have for such an energy need.
And if you just go another
step further, you can go
to Kardashev Type III.
And that's one that not only
controls their solar system
and all of the energy output
of their solar system,
but now goes to the entire galaxy.
I think most realistically you
might imagine a civilization
like that living around
Sagittarius A star,
that's the super massive black hole
that lives right in the
center of our galaxy.
And that thing spews out
gigantic amounts of energy
that you might imagine a
very advanced civilization
harvesting and using.
And indeed, I think it's
an interesting place
that we should consider looking
for alien civilizations.
Maybe not an intuitive place,
but a place that I think
we have a good argument
as to why they might end up
in the center of a galaxy.
Hart's Fact A, named after Michael Hart,
is connected to the Fermi paradox.
The idea as to how come we
don't see aliens out there
if it seems like they should be out there,
and Fact A in particular points out
that there are no aliens
on Earth right now.
We don't see a civilization
cohabiting the Earth with us.
We haven't been totally
colonized by alien civilization.
It appears to be a very lonely planet
with just one civilization, which is us
living on it right now.
What I like about Fact A is
it's kind of indisputable.
It's one of the hardest points we can
really say in astronomy.
I can't claim that a distant
exoplanet doesn't have
an extraterrestrial civilization on it,
but I can be much more
assured about the fact
that we are not currently
cohabiting the Earth
with another alien civilization.
I feel much more confident
making that claim.
And even that claim, as
weak as that might seem,
does put some interesting
limits upon the behavior
of other civilizations.
It means really
that a galactic
civilization does not exist,
that there is no instances
of a marauding berserker-type
civilization that just decided
to gobble up every exoplanet,
every real estate it could find
and turn it into another
colony for itself.
Because if that happened,
the whole Milky Way
would've been colonized by
now and we wouldn't be here.
And this really connects to the ideas
of self-replicating probes,
also called Von Neumann probes,
which have been argued for a
long time to be a real problem
for those thinking about
life in the universe
and especially life in the galaxy.
For it turns out that even
though the galaxy is very large,
100,000 light years across,
even traveling the galaxy
at sort of Voyager 1,
Voyager 2 type speeds,
the speeds of our current spacecraft,
it should have been eminently possible
to have colonized the entire
galaxy many times over
during its 13 billion year history.
That's a long period of time
for all of that colonization
to have taken place, and
you really don't need
to have fast rockets to colonize
the entire galaxy by now.
Yet clearly that hasn't
happened as Fact A demonstrates.
And so that's interesting.
It means that maybe
civilizations do emerge elsewhere
in the galaxy, but they
never have the will
or the capabilities to conduct
such an expansion phase,
such an aggressive expansion phase
where they take over the entire galaxy
because, of course, we wouldn't be here
had that had happened.
That is probably one of
the strongest data points
I think we have.
We don't have any evidence for life
outside of the Solar System.
And so when we talk about
the propensity of planets
to form life, probably the
only strong data point we have
is the fact that we are here,
but also more importantly,
when life appears
to have emerged on the Earth.
And strikingly it appears
to have emerged very,
very quickly in the Earth's history.
Now, this naively could be taken to say,
"Well, therefore, if life starts quickly,
it must be an easy process."
But we have to be careful
when making such claims.
Perhaps the evolutionary process
to go from the simplest forms
of life to something like us,
a self-aware entity which can
do all of this paleontology,
all the statistics and math,
maybe that timescale takes 4 billion years
pretty much all the time
on these types of planets.
And if it consistently
takes 4 billion years
for that process to plays out,
life kind of has to get going
pretty quickly, else there
wouldn't be enough time for us
to emerge in the first place.
I think a surprising fact about the Earth
people don't realize
is that it will likely
become uninhabitable to complex life
in less than a billion years time.
And so life really does
have to get going quickly,
else there just wouldn't be enough time
in that evolutionary process to get to us.
So we could naively look
at that early start to life
and say, "Therefore, life is easy."
We add this complexity of evolution, say,
"Maybe not so quickly."
But eventually if we push that
early start to life further
and further back, you
eventually overwhelm even
that evolutionary
timescale and you do end up
with a genuine result that actually
there's no way around it,
life actually is an easy process
despite all of the nuance
of that evolutionary argument.
And indeed, I think for the
first time we are seeing signs
that we are crossing that threshold.
There was a recent result
that we are able to date
the emergence of life on the
Earth to 4.2 billion years ago.
And for context, the oceans
formed 4.4 billion years ago.
So within 200 million years,
really a cosmic snapshot,
we had the conditions
ready for life emerging,
and we went all the way from there
to the first organisms on our planet
within 200 million years.
That is such a short period
of time that it overwhelms
that evolutionary argument.
And you have for the
first time, I would claim,
strong evidence, not definitive evidence,
but strong evidence that life
is indeed an easy process
to get going, at least
under the conditions
that the Earth enjoyed.
So based off the early
start to life on the Earth,
we might genuinely think
that simple microbial life
could be quite common,
at least assuming that
Earth-like conditions
are common in the universe.
So we'd have lots of planets out there
with simple life on Earth.
Now, the interesting question then is
how often do those
simple life forms develop
and evolve all the way up to
something that is like us?
Here it took 4 billion years.
Perhaps it takes a little bit less
or a little bit longer on other planets.
And so we might look forward to the future
and say, if it takes 4
billion years for this process
to happen, surely as the universe ages,
there should be an emergence
of more and more civilizations
into the future.
But we actually have to
be a little bit careful
with that argument too,
because stars and planets
have finite lifetimes.
They don't last forever,
they eventually die.
Our own Earth will die
as a habitable biosphere
in less than a billion
years due to the evolution
of our star.
As the star evolves,
it grows in luminosity
and will actually eventually
make the Earth too warm
for liquid water and
thus life on our planet.
So there'll be a collapse point
in less than a billion
years when that happens.
So this sets a time constraint
for life in the universe.
Not only do you have to have
life get going fairly quickly,
then you also have to have enough time
for that evolutionary process to play out
and get to something like us.
And this immediately rules
out a large swath of stars
as possible places where
civilization might live.
For example, stars which are
more massive than the Sun
have shorter lifetimes.
They burn through their
nuclear fuel much faster.
And so perhaps those stars
wouldn't have enough time
for a civilization to develop on them.
Vice versa, we have the M-dwarf stars,
stars, which can last for
trillions of years in some cases,
and so potentially there
that might be the place in the far future
we can imagine civilizations emerging,
and we would be the first,
the weirdos of the universe,
who lived around a Sun-like
star early in its history,
and civilizations emerged much later on
around these M-dwarf stars.
There are two basic strategies
which we might attempt
to search for life in the universe.
One is with a so-called
biosignature that is a signature
of biochemistry essentially
on another planet,
and a second is a technosignature,
the signature of technology.
Now, technology obviously requires
that not only do you have life
that an advanced
civilization also developed
on those planets, and
so that naturally seems
like a smaller piece
of the pie to look at.
However, those technosignatures
could be very, very loud,
heard from millions of light
years away potentially,
and could also perhaps be very persistent.
We can imagine a civilization
maybe building a beacon
or something that could
last for billions of years
to perpetuate its
knowledge into the cosmos.
So a simple balance is not so easy
in weighing which of these
options would be most fruitful.
The biosignature case
certainly has had, I'd say,
greater attention from entities like NASA
and government funding agencies,
because after all, you don't require
all this evolutionary complexity.
You can just have simple life
and potentially still be able to see them.
The way biosignatures
work is to look for gases
that are emitted into the atmosphere
which are uniquely produced by life.
At least that's the theory.
The problem is it's very
difficult to find gases
which are indeed uniquely
produced by life.
Lots of gases can be produced
through geological processes
as a side product, and so that
can become a false positive
to our search efforts.
A classic example of this is oxygen.
Of course, plant-based life
manufactures oxygen on the Earth
through the process of photosynthesis,
and so it would seem like
oxygen would be a good thing
to look for, especially because oxygen
is a very reactive molecule
that really doesn't want to
hang around in an atmosphere.
Something has to be making it
because otherwise it just
reacts with stuff and oxidizes
and so quickly disappears.
The fact that our planet has
a sustained level of oxygen
proves essentially that life is here.
At least that's true on the Earth.
But we could imagine
different types of planets
where oxygen is being
manufactured without the need
for life at all.
One possible way this could
happen is through a process
called photolysis.
So ultraviolet radiation
from the Sun strikes
the upper atmosphere,
and if there is water
in that atmosphere, H2O,
the H2O will be split up into the hydrogen
and the oxygen separately.
Now, hydrogen is very, very light.
It's the lightest element you can have.
And so it's very easy for
it to escape into space
and simply be lost, like
letting go of a helium balloon
that disappears into the sky.
But the oxygen is heavier and it sinks.
And so you can end up with
just ultraviolet radiation
plus water in the atmosphere
generating a significant amount
of oxygen in a planet
without any life involved.
And so that signature would
be a false positive for us.
If we are not careful, we would
interpret that to be life,
whereas in fact, it is not.
And so astronomers, chemists, biologists,
we are involved in this game
now of trying to imagine
all of the different signatures
that life could produce
and all of the different
confounding factors
that might trick us and trying to find
those unique combinations
that we really trust as
being the smoking gun,
that this has to be life.
So it's a very complex chemical field
that we're involved in, but
ultimately a tractable question,
but a question that we still
need to work really hard on.
From a scientific perspective,
the question we really
care about is looking
for life on these exoplanets
and indeed planets in
the Solar System as well.
So for example, Mars is a good case study.
We have sent robots there
which have attempted to look for life.
And a big question has always been:
are we accidentally carrying
life with us to that planet?
And thus when we do the
experiment to look for life,
are we maybe accidentally
detecting just life,
which hitchhiked a ride and
joined us on that journey
and arrived at Mars without
really that being the intention?
It's actually very, very difficult
to totally sterilize a spacecraft
and eradicate every single spore
on the surface of that thing.
There is essentially always
gonna be a little passenger,
which hitches a ride with you,
but we, of course, wanna
minimize that as much as possible
to reduce the chance of
that being a false positive.
And so this raises some interesting ideas
about where's the best
place to look for life?
Because Mars has had a
lot of contamination,
not only from spacecraft from
the Earth, but also asteroids.
Even before we had a space program,
there was still material
being constantly swapped
between the Earth and
Mars just by meteorites
being knocked off one
and landing on the other.
So perhaps life has long contaminated Mars
even before humans were around.
But there are places in the Solar System
where that shouldn't have happened.
You look at the icy moons of Europa
and Enceladus, for example.
Those are protected by a thick ice shell,
many kilometers thick,
which should really prevent any material
being able to penetrate through that ice
and get into that subsurface ocean.
So for me, I think those are the most
interesting places to look.
We could drill down through,
hopefully be very careful
about contamination,
and we would have a pristine location
where if we detected life there,
I think we could be pretty assured
that was not a contamination
from the Earth.
This was a genuine
second abiogenesis event.
And once you have two starts
to life in the Solar System
that would essentially establish that life
really would be everywhere
in the universe.
I think we have to accept the possibility
that even though we're
on this quest to look
for life in the universe,
we may never get a
conclusive answer either way.
I certainly hope that
we can find an answer,
but it is possible we never will.
For the truth is that
space is just a very,
very huge expanse to try and explore
and have conclusive answers on.
One of the hardest
scientific aspects of this
is that you can't prove a negative.
So I can never prove to you
that Mars does not have life on it.
I can look at the surface
and claim on the surface
I am 99% sure there are no microbes.
But then you could also say,
"Well, what about underneath the surface?
Have you checked there?
What about underneath
that rock over there?
Or behind that canyon?
Or behind that hill?"
And so I can never totally prove,
totally prove, even the
nearest planet to us, Mars,
that it does not have life on it.
So what hope is there in
that sense of ever proving
that we are alone?
It's impossible to prove we are alone.
We will always wonder about that.
We can get a series of no
results or negative results,
but it's never gonna
establish true loneliness.
The fact that space is simply so large
means that this is a challenge that maybe
we should be patient.
I mean, I hope we can get
an answer in my lifetime.
I would love to know the
answer in my lifetime,
but this may be a journey
that humanity undertakes
over not just centuries,
but maybe millennia into the future,
in a similar way that
Galileo 400 years ago
was first starting astronomy
and couldn't have imagined how astronomy
and the discovery of
exoplanets and cosmology
would be born from his
creation of the telescope.
We have a long journey
ahead of us in astronomy too
to answering this question
about life in the universe.
But it is the great question
and a question which I think many
of our future descendants will be inspired
to continue studying.
