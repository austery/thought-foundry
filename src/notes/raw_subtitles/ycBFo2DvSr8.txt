[Music]


so
 today
 we
 are
 very
 excited
 to
 welcome


one
 of
 the
 most
 impressive
 leaders
 in


global
 Finance
 sagio
 erot
 CEO
 of
 UBS


which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 banks
 in
 the


world
 saio
 LED
 UBS
 from
 2011
 until
 2020


but
 he
 recently
 made
 a
 dramatic
 return


after
 the
 historic
 acquisition
 of
 the


main
 rival
 credit


twiss
 but
 first
 Serio
 will
 uh
 go
 all
 the


way
 back
 and
 talk
 about
 uh
 you
 know
 when


you
 were
 uh
 even
 younger
 you
 were
 a


talented
 football
 player
 so
 how
 come
 you


ended
 up
 in
 banking
 I
 wasn't
 so
 talented


obviously
 so
 I
 guess
 uh
 well
 my
 dream


was
 definitely
 I
 would
 have
 swapped


until
 today
 probably
 playing
 a
 final
 of


the
 World
 Cup
 and
 scoring
 a
 goal
 uh
 with


my
 current
 job
 for
 sure
 so
 I
 guess
 my


dream
 as
 a
 young
 person
 was
 definitely


to
 be
 a
 uh
 professional
 football
 player


then
 and
 but
 then
 I
 in
 Switzerland
 you


know
 we
 we
 could
 go
 through
 you
 know
 an


education
 system
 that
 allows
 you
 to
 go


through
 an
 apprenticeship
 so
 I
 started


uh
 in
 banking
 as
 a
 plan
 B
 you
 know
 to


the
 football
 career
 and
 so
 when
 it


turned
 out
 that
 I
 wasn't
 good
 enough
 to


be
 a
 football
 player
 or
 a
 professional


one
 at
 least
 then
 I
 uh
 opted
 for


becoming
 being
 a
 Trader
 and
 so
 my
 career


in
 banking
 started
 yeah
 well
 I
 would


argue
 you've
 got
 you've
 scored
 quite
 a


lot
 of
 goals
 but
 it's
 just
 that
 it's


being
 in
 finance
 rather
 than
 football


but
 what
 happened
 you
 got
 a
 um
 a
 very


important
 position
 you
 were
 only
 27


years
 old
 yeah
 that
 was
 probably
 uh
 the


defining
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 defining
 moments


in
 my
 career
 because
 uh
 back
 then
 I
 went


through
 an
 apprenticeship
 I
 stayed
 in


Lugano
 the
 south
 of
 Switzerland
 uh
 and
 I


I
 did
 a
 master
 in
 in
 banking
 and
 then
 I


was
 hired
 by
 City
 Bank
 to
 be
 a
 Trader


for
 convertible
 bonds
 and
 options
 and


and
 so
 on
 and
 I
 did
 it
 for
 18
 months
 and


then
 I
 got
 the
 the
 famous
 offer
 you


can't
 refuse
 from
 from
 uh
 from
 Mar
 Lynch


which
 was
 not
 necessarily
 Financial
 was


the
 ability
 or
 the
 opportunity
 to
 to


build
 up
 their
 Swiss
 frank
 Capital


Market
 operation
 in


Switzerland


1987
 so
 basically
 from
 scratch
 was


almost
 no
 office
 no
 no
 telephone
 so
 and


me
 and
 another
 two
 or
 three
 colleagues


you
 know
 myself
 as
 one
 of
 the
 the
 two


leader
 took
 on
 the
 embarking
 to
 this


journey
 of
 building
 from
 scratch
 at
 the


swis
 Frank
 operation
 that
 eventually
 got


bigger
 we
 went
 to
 the
 stock
 exchange
 we


got
 a
 banking
 license
 and
 that
 was
 a
 a


fantastic
 Journey
 so
 I
 was
 training


during
 the
 day
 in
 the
 evening
 sorting


out
 you
 know
 how
 to
 manage
 the
 back


office
 and
 how
 to
 manage
 the
 entire


operation
 something
 totally
 Unthinkable


today
 and
 that
 was
 a
 defining
 experience


because
 I
 I
 I
 learn
 how
 to
 manage
 how
 to


build
 up
 a
 business
 how
 to
 you
 know
 look


at
 different
 uh
 ways
 of
 uh
 being
 you


know
 a
 leader
 and
 and
 still
 being
 why


would
 that
 be
 Unthinkable


today
 because
 today
 I
 would
 say
 the


regulatory
 environment
 is
 completely


different
 governance
 around
 large


organizations
 is
 completely
 different
 so


giving
 a
 to
 a
 27
 years
 old
 person
 uh


mandate
 to
 build
 up
 such
 a
 business
 was


a
 probably
 uh
 uh
 yeah
 I
 think
 is


Unthinkable
 today
 most
 likely
 yeah
 fast


forward
 to
 19th
 of
 March
 20123
 when
 UBS


agreed
 to
 buy
 credit
 Swiss
 there
 was
 a


big
 big
 turbulence
 in
 the
 market
 in
 the


week
 up
 to
 this
 now
 what
 did
 you
 what


did
 you


think
 well
 seeing
 this
 from
 the
 sideline


in
 a
 way
 at
 that
 stage
 yeah
 some
 kind
 of


interested
 because
 I
 I
 I
 even
 back
 then


I
 was
 a
 a
 chair
 of
 swissy
 uh
 and
 uh
 but


also
 the
 facto
 as
 a
 as
 a
 banker
 or
 a


former
 Banker
 I
 felt
 you
 know
 very
 sorry


for
 seeing
 that
 you
 know
 situation


developing
 and
 and
 uh
 and
 uh
 but
 I
 I


have
 to
 say
 that
 I
 never
 thought
 that
 it


would
 hand
 so
 dramatically
 right
 over


you
 know
 of
 course
 you
 know
 until


Wednesday
 the
 Wednesday
 before
 the


weekend
 there
 that
 day
 when
 I


heard
 um
 that
 the
 Swiss
 fed
 Council
 was


uh
 in
 an
 emergency
 U
 um
 session
 that
 I


understand
 I
 understood
 that
 something


must
 be
 pretty
 bad
 and
 actually
 I
 knew


that
 the
 weekend
 would
 turn
 out
 into


something
 so
 almost
 impossible
 that
 they


make
 such
 announcements
 on
 special


sessions
 of
 the
 federal
 Council
 without


something
 meaningful
 uh
 coming
 and
 there


uh
 so
 I
 uh
 but
 I
 I
 have
 to
 say
 that
 uh


the
 the
 speed
 at
 which
 things
 uh


developed
 was
 was
 uh
 somehow
 tragic
 and


and


surprising
 now
 this
 was
 in
 a
 way
 the


biggest
 fault
 since
 Lon
 Brothers
 right


so
 how
 shocked
 were


you
 to
 be
 fair
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 we


recognize
 I
 recognize
 uh
 for
 many
 years


that
 maybe
 c
 s
 didn't
 have
 a
 sustainable


business
 model
 uh
 and
 uh
 and
 in
 that


sense
 I
 was
 surprised
 that
 they
 waited


for
 so
 long
 to
 take
 a
 radical
 decision


and
 as
 time
 went
 by
 particularly
 after


their
 Capital
 increase
 in
 in
 in
 in


October
 that
 didn't
 really
 you
 know
 go


through
 well
 with
 investors
 not
 only
 in


terms
 of
 the
 placement
 of
 the
 stocks
 but


you
 know
 the
 strategy
 I
 I
 thought
 that


they
 would
 try
 to
 find
 a
 buyer
 or
 to
 do


a
 break
 up
 or
 do
 something's
 radical
 so


uh
 basically
 to
 let
 that
 external


factors
 like
 the
 regional
 banking
 crisis


would
 force
 them
 somehow
 to
 you
 know
 to


to
 have
 to
 take
 actions
 uh
 uh
 was
 a


little
 bit
 surprising
 and
 uh
 but
 you


know
 I
 think
 it
 was
 the
 bank
 and
 and
 and


potentially
 even
 other
 actors
 I
 mean


they
 were
 probably
 not
 uh
 on
 top
 of
 the


situation
 for
 for
 too
 long
 I
 think


Switzerland
 did
 a
 pretty
 good
 job
 during


the


weekend
 uh
 to
 avoid
 a
 Leeman
 alike


crisis
 because
 I
 think
 that
 one
 has
 to


also
 put
 into
 the
 context
 that
 at
 least


the
 lessons
 learned
 from
 the
 financial


crisis
 has
 created
 uh
 plans
 Capital


buffers
 and
 uh
 that
 would
 not
 translate


into
 a
 an
 impossible
 mission
 for
 a


private
 solution
 to
 happen
 and
 also


which
 is
 our
 Theory
 and
 that
 is
 proven
 a


wind
 down
 of
 credit
 swis
 would
 have
 not


costed
 the
 taxpayer
 any
 money
 but
 of


course
 he
 would
 have
 created
 a
 lot
 of


turmoils
 and
 uncertainties
 in
 the
 market


because
 the
 question
 would
 have
 been


very
 quickly
 was
 next
 right
 so
 so
 what


happens
 during
 a
 weekend
 like
 that
 I


mean
 this
 is
 not
 an
 ordinary
 weekend
 I


mean
 what
 happens
 in
 a
 country
 who
 yeah


but
 for
 me
 you
 know
 I'm
 I
 was
 I
 was


still
 a
 half
 Observer
 absolutely
 but
 you


were
 still
 you
 I
 mean3
 is
 a
 is
 a
 is
 a


very
 significant
 power
 in
 the
 financial


industry
 yeah
 but
 in
 in
 a
 weekend
 like


that
 where
 everybody
 gets
 together
 to


solve
 a
 crisis
 what
 is
 what
 is
 happening


specifically
 yeah
 it
 was
 interesting


because
 uh
 yeah
 from
 Wednesday
 onward
 I


started
 to
 get
 phone
 calls
 from
 you
 know


former
 colleagues
 or
 or
 competitors
 of


the
 banks
 right
 the
 banks
 uh
 from
 people


in
 the
 industry
 actually
 asking
 me
 what


I
 thought
 about
 the
 situation
 we
 were
 of


course
 debating
 And
 discussing
 and
 then


uh
 during
 the
 weekend
 you
 know
 I
 I
 also


got
 uh
 some
 phone
 calls
 um
 um
 in
 during


the
 process
 but
 I
 not
 from
 the
 UBS
 part


but
 uh
 as
 a
 you
 know
 there
 was
 a
 a


consideration
 about
 developing
 uh
 other


plans
 so
 uh
 so
 I
 was
 somehow
 during
 the


weekend
 prepar
 that
 something
 would


would
 happen
 and
 yeah
 I
 think
 that's


what
 you
 what
 you
 saw
 is
 that
 the
 facto


uh
 uh
 very
 rapidly
 uh
 the
 private


Solutions
 developing
 as
 the
 most
 viable


one
 the
 one
 that
 would
 create
 certainty


developing
 and
 so
 uh
 I
 have
 to
 say
 that


Sunday
 afternoon
 when
 I
 heard
 that
 UBS


was
 uh
 basically
 chosen
 as
 the
 solution


I
 was
 somehow
 relieved
 because
 I
 felt


that
 uh
 you
 know
 having
 a
 public
 uh
 uh


solution
 would
 have
 been
 quite
 damaging


uh
 not
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do
 and
 uh
 so


and
 then
 things
 uh
 stayed
 quiet
 for
 few


hours
 until
 Monday
 morning
 and
 then
 I


got
 a
 phone
 call
 from
 from
 the
 German


from
 the
 German
 yeah
 and
 what
 did
 he


say
 yeah
 I
 said
 that
 we
 we
 uh
 he
 told
 me


we
 need
 to
 talk
 uh
 and
 so
 I
 suspected


was
 not
 probably
 just
 having
 a
 beer
 or


just
 asking
 my
 uh
 advice
 it
 could
 have


been
 because
 we
 but
 uh
 then
 we
 decided


to
 meet
 on
 Tuesday
 and
 uh
 and
 after
 a


few
 minutes
 it
 got
 pretty
 clear
 on
 the


reason
 for
 for
 the
 meeting
 what
 did
 you


think
 well
 of
 course
 I
 was
 uh
 you
 know


on
 one
 end
 uh
 I
 felt
 like
 uh
 yeah
 the


Temptation
 uh
 was
 a
 sense
 of
 uh
 of


loyalty
 to
 UBS
 uh
 kind
 of
 Call
 of


Duty
 also
 to
 the
 to
 the
 country
 uh
 you


know
 I
 was
 I
 felt
 honored
 that
 people


were
 thinking
 about
 me
 on
 the
 other
 hand


you
 know
 I
 had
 to
 find
 my
 own
 motivation


so
 and
 uh
 my
 own
 motivation
 that
 I


thought
 and
 I
 still
 believe
 today
 that


you
 know
 out
 of
 something
 that
 is


definitely
 not
 ideal
 and
 quite
 tragic
 we


can
 do
 something
 great
 and
 eventually


something
 that
 can
 create
 longlasting


value
 for
 for
 shareholders
 but
 also
 for


clients
 and
 employees
 of
 the
 of
 because


you
 know
 on
 one
 end
 you
 know
 may
 for


many
 of
 the
 credit
 Swiss
 employees
 was


an
 Agony
 in
 the
 last
 few
 years
 and
 I


think
 that
 uh
 for
 the
 UBS
 employees
 we


now
 have
 a
 even
 stronger
 competitive


position
 uh
 more
 Diversified
 business


our
 clients
 will
 benefit
 and
 I
 do
 think


also
 shareholders
 will
 benefit
 over
 time


so
 I
 felt
 okay
 there
 is
 we
 think
 so
 too


by
 the
 way
 yes
 good
 but
 there
 there
 was


also
 a
 motivation
 for
 me
 to
 do
 something


that
 was
 quite
 transformational
 and
 uh


for
 the
 industry
 and
 uh
 and
 therefore
 um


so
 I
 got
 a
 good
 motivation
 so
 it
 took
 me


48
 hours
 to
 to
 think
 about
 who
 did
 you


speak


to
 who
 do
 you
 take
 advice
 from
 well
 the


I
 I
 think
 I
 I
 spoke
 to
 my
 wife
 uh
 but


after
 a
 few
 seconds
 she
 told
 me
 but
 it


looks
 like
 you're
 looking
 at
 my
 face
 she


thought
 she
 felt
 I
 already
 decided
 as
 I


was
 talking
 to
 her
 but
 uh
 no
 honestly
 I


I
 uh
 I
 a
 couple
 of
 friends
 uh
 I
 spoke
 to


uh
 but
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 have
 to
 say
 that


none
 of
 them
 told
 me
 don't
 do
 it


everybody
 was
 quite
 uh
 convinced
 that
 I


should
 should
 follow
 m
 but
 you
 you
 had


been
 very
 successful
 at
 UBS
 and
 now


going
 back
 and
 taking
 on
 something
 which


is
 you
 know
 in
 part
 risky
 right
 what
 did


you
 what
 did
 you
 think
 about
 that
 you


know
 that
 was
 probably
 the
 the
 really


deciding
 uh
 moment
 because
 I
 made
 a
 very


simple


analysis
 the
 reason
 I
 mentioned
 to
 you


this
 the
 the
 sense
 of
 uh
 duty
 to
 UBS
 uh


uh
 and
 and
 and
 and
 to
 Switzerland
 played


a
 role
 in
 making
 me
 feel
 like
 if
 I
 say


no
 and
 things
 don't
 turn
 out
 well
 not


that
 I
 think
 I
 can
 resolve
 every
 problem


to
 be
 honest
 but
 I
 would
 feel
 somehow


Corr
 responsible
 for
 not
 not
 having
 the


guts
 or
 being
 egoistic
 about
 not
 doing


it
 for
 whatever
 my
 own
 reasons
 right
 so


so
 I
 felt
 I
 could
 not
 really
 feel


comfortable
 about
 being
 in
 that


situation
 and
 then
 on
 the
 other
 end
 I


felt
 that
 if
 it
 turns
 out
 to
 be
 a


success
 like
 I
 believe
 it
 is
 I
 would


feel
 stupid
 for
 not
 having
 do
 it
 so
 I


said
 I
 have
 no
 choice
 I
 had
 absolutely


no
 choice
 I
 had
 to
 do
 it
 so
 because
 I


would
 feel
 most
 likely
 bad
 about
 any
 of


the
 two
 scenario
 so
 the
 likelihood
 that


we're
 going
 to
 be
 an
 on
 event
 is
 very


low
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 uh
 in
 that
 sense


uh
 that
 was
 my
 rational
 for
 taking
 the


decision
 and
 this
 sense
 of
 Duty
 for
 your


country
 where
 does
 that
 come
 from
 you


think
 probably
 because
 we
 as
 the


southern
 part
 of
 Switzerland
 the
 Italian


part
 of
 Switzerland
 is
 a
 minority
 so


it's
 probably
 also
 the
 first
 time
 that


somebody
 from
 the
 south
 of
 Switzerland


has
 such
 a
 important
 uh
 position
 I
 don't


know
 I
 don't
 know
 is
 a
 good
 question
 I
 I


do
 believe
 that
 there
 is
 I
 love
 this
 but


I
 do
 believe
 there
 has
 to
 be
 some
 kind


of
 uh
 sense
 of
 standing
 and


demonstrating
 uh
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 the


country
 that
 that
 we
 we
 can
 we
 are
 also


so
 did
 you
 do
 it
 did
 you
 do
 it
 on
 behalf


of
 the
 Italian
 minority
 in
 Switzerland


yeah
 no
 no
 no
 no
 I
 did
 it
 because
 I


believe
 no
 I
 I
 mean
 fundamentally
 I


think
 Switzerland
 is
 a
 is
 living
 out
 of


diversity
 between
 cultural
 diversity
 the


German
 23
 of


Switzerland
 we
 are
 only
 300,000
 people


out
 of
 uh
 eight
 and
 a
 half
 n
 million


people
 so
 definitely
 a
 minority
 but
 uh


but
 still
 the
 with
 the
 French
 people
 we


have
 a
 very
 cohesive
 way
 of
 looking
 at


it
 but
 of
 course
 you
 know
 if
 you
 ask
 me


my
 spontaneous
 reaction
 is
 this
 one


probably
 was
 uh
 something
 that
 I
 feel
 uh


uh
 you
 know
 I
 can
 also
 can
 also


contribute
 to
 that
 now
 um
 what
 did
 you


do
 during
 the
 first
 weeks
 back
 at
 UBS


how
 do
 you
 uh
 enter
 a
 situation
 like


that
 well
 first
 of
 all
 I
 have
 to
 say


that
 it
 was
 quite
 surreal
 how
 things


developed
 so
 quickly
 I
 found
 myself
 into


into
 into
 my
 office
 uh
 old
 office
 within


a
 week
 uh
 in
 the
 bank
 within
 48
 hours
 or


you
 know
 basically
 we
 announced
 it
 on


the
 29th
 of
 March
 so
 basically
 the
 next


morning
 I
 was
 in
 the
 bank
 and
 uh
 and
 uh


it
 it
 was
 so


intense
 that
 I
 had
 to
 focus
 on
 the


priorities
 the
 priority
 was
 okay
 what


what
 do
 we
 need
 to
 do
 to
 stabilize
 uh
 uh


the
 clients
 what
 do
 we
 need
 to
 do
 to


stabilize
 the
 employees
 what
 needs
 to
 be


done
 to
 to
 really
 start
 to
 you


know
 uh
 develop
 uh
 the
 integration
 plan


what
 are
 the
 priorities
 uh
 I
 had
 to


start
 to
 consider
 okay
 with
 the
 team


that
 is
 going
 to
 uh
 be
 with
 me
 uh
 and


and
 and
 one
 of
 the
 first
 priority
 for
 me


from
 the
 very
 beginning
 was
 okay
 I
 need


to
 fully
 understand
 what
 kind
 of
 risk
 we


took
 on
 what
 is
 the
 liquidity
 position


of
 the
 company
 Bank
 not
 only
 for
 risk


management
 but
 because
 my
 first
 priority


I
 told
 the
 board
 was
 we
 need
 to
 repay
 as


quickly
 as
 we
 can
 the
 emergency


liquidity
 support
 of
 the
 government
 and


we
 need
 to
 return
 the
 guarantee
 on
 the


portfolio
 that
 was
 uh
 uh
 selected
 as
 a


potentially


problematic
 uh
 as
 soon
 as
 possible
 and


that
 was
 my
 number
 one
 priority
 and
 why


is
 that
 so
 important
 to
 pay
 that
 by


quickly
 because
 that
 was


in
 my
 point
 of
 view
 once
 we
 would


determine
 that
 we
 have
 the
 strength
 and


the
 ability
 to
 absorb
 any
 of
 the
 excess


risk
 that
 we
 uh
 would
 find
 and
 then
 we


are
 in
 control
 of
 that
 that
 would
 be
 the


ultimate
 way
 to


reassure
 um
 our
 stakeholders
 clients
 and


in
 general
 you
 know
 our
 employees
 and


and
 and
 the
 rest
 of
 of
 the
 community
 in


which
 we
 operate
 so
 the
 ability
 to
 say


okay
 we
 took
 over
 we
 are
 in
 control
 we


can
 do
 it
 with
 our
 own
 Capital
 our
 own


liquidity
 for
 me
 was
 the
 the
 ultimate


thing
 that
 we
 were
 comfortable
 about
 our


due
 diligence
 so
 it
 took
 uh
 uh
 three


four
 months
 to
 do
 that
 right
 so
 to
 to
 to


come
 but
 for
 me
 was
 almost
 very
 clear


from
 the
 very
 beginning
 after
 a
 couple
 a


couple
 of
 three
 four
 weeks
 I
 you
 know
 I


realized
 that
 we
 we
 would
 have
 a
 good


chance
 to
 to
 do
 that
 you
 said
 that
 it


was
 clear
 to
 you
 that
 credit
 F
 didn't


have
 a
 sustainable
 business
 model
 what


do
 you
 how
 could
 you
 see
 that
 what
 what


do
 you
 mean
 by
 that
 in
 a
 very
 easy
 way


it's
 very
 simple
 there
 is
 nothing
 more


dangerous
 than
 a
 large
 bank
 or
 a
 bank


not
 making
 money
 or
 losing
 money
 that


should
 be
 in
 mind
 there
 is
 no
 Capital
 no


liquidity
 no
 no
 matter
 what
 do
 you
 think


if
 you
 have
 a
 bank
 that
 is
 either
 not


covering
 its
 cost
 of
 capital
 or
 even


worse
 losing
 money
 then
 you
 know
 that


something
 is
 wrong
 but
 in
 in
 in
 essence


for
 me
 when
 you
 have
 a
 a
 a
 Wealth


Management
 Center


business
 an
 asset
 Gathering
 let's
 call


it
 right
 Centric
 business
 with
 a
 strong


position
 in
 the
 Universal
 banking
 Market


in


Switzerland
 if
 you
 are
 not
 able
 to
 pay


for
 your
 cost
 of
 capital
 then
 you
 know


there
 is
 a
 problem
 and
 that
 was
 the
 case


but
 what
 was
 the
 problem
 I
 mean
 why
 were


they
 not
 making
 money
 because
 they
 were


allocating
 too
 much
 Capital
 to
 the


Investment
 Bank
 yeah
 below
 and
 with


returns
 below
 their
 cost
 of


equity
 and
 uh
 because
 they
 were
 still


relying
 too
 much
 on
 taking
 uh
 or
 or


using


credit
 uh
 as
 a
 lever
 to
 go
 into
 business


relationship
 including
 wealth
 management


which
 is
 not
 bad
 for
 per
 se
 but
 you
 know


if
 you
 are
 a
 wealth
 management
 or
 an


asset
 Gathering
 Centric
 organization


Landing
 is
 a
 tool
 that
 you
 give
 to


clients
 you
 know
 to
 comp
 Le
 your


offering
 is
 not
 the
 tool
 that
 you
 get
 in


order
 to
 get
 into
 business
 and
 and
 and


you
 know
 Cru
 is
 very
 strong
 c
 as
 very


good
 people
 very
 good
 products
 very
 good


capabilities
 and
 was
 seen
 over
 the
 last


uh
 centuries
 and
 the
 last
 decades
 as
 a


entrepreneurial
 bank
 so
 but
 in
 a
 sense


it
 become
 way
 too
 entrepreneurial
 and


way
 too
 risk-taking
 in
 order
 to


accommodate
 clients
 that
 over
 time
 it


lost
 completely
 the
 disciplines


on
 risk
 reward
 and
 return
 on
 Capital


what
 was
 the
 moral
 like
 what
 was
 the


moral
 like
 in
 the
 workforce
 there
 when


you
 took
 over
 definitely
 a
 lot
 of


disappointment
 a
 lot
 of
 angry
 people
 a


lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 were
 you


know
 for
 different
 reason
 you
 know
 the


one
 that
 uh
 that
 they
 were
 absolutely


not


uh
 comfortable
 with
 losing
 their


identity
 as
 as
 an
 organization
 the
 one


that
 were
 totally
 pissed
 off
 because


they
 lost
 a
 lot
 of
 their
 money
 uh
 in


different
 you
 know
 uh
 and
 uh
 and
 so
 on


and
 so
 forth
 so
 the
 one
 that
 were


absolutely
 uh
 uncomfortable
 with
 the


idea
 now
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 to
 be
 in
 the


same
 house
 as
 the
 one
 they've
 been


fighting
 at
 for
 for
 years
 and
 years
 so


was
 a
 mix
 I
 think
 it's
 probably


difficult
 to
 imagine
 from
 the
 outside


because
 you've
 been
 competing
 for
 how


many
 years
 I
 mean
 crit
 with
 and
 uh
 and


170
 years
 170
 years
 right
 on
 on
 one
 on


each
 Corner
 in
 every
 town
 in
 Switzerland


right
 yeah
 and
 then
 suddenly
 you
 are


going
 to
 be
 friends
 and
 family
 yeah
 it's


not
 it's
 not
 yeah
 but
 my
 analogy
 I'm


telling
 to
 people
 is
 to
 say
 fine
 we
 we


have
 been
 fighting
 to
 for
 for
 the


national
 championships
 now
 we
 are
 the


Swiss
 national
 team
 and
 we
 need
 to
 play


for
 the
 bigger
 games
 and
 therefore


that's
 a
 new
 Mission
 so
 I
 mean
 uh
 I
 mean


the
 reason
 we
 thought
 Al
 so
 attractive


the
 situation
 is
 because
 it's
 a
 kind
 of


merger
 you
 can
 never
 do
 in
 peace
 time


but
 look
 in
 banking
 all
 the
 mergers
 that


creates
 any
 value
 are
 coming
 at
 moments


of
 stress
 yeah
 look
 back
 at
 US
 Banks
 you


look
 back
 how
 they
 got
 now
 into
 their


position
 it's
 all
 about
 them
 being


allowed
 or
 being
 asked
 during
 the


financial
 crisis
 to
 grab
 or
 put
 together


banks
 that
 were
 about
 to
 fail
 or
 they


were
 failing
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth
 so


so
 and
 financial
 crisis
 they
 come
 every


so
 often
 so
 it's
 the
 waiting
 game
 right


yeah
 so
 the
 issue
 is
 that
 it's
 a
 Pity


that
 it
 takes
 a
 crisis
 to
 create


something
 that
 makes
 sense
 but
 that's
 a


reality
 by
 the
 way
 you
 know
 that
 a
 lot


of
 m&
 fails
 not
 because
 the
 industrial


logic
 is
 not
 there
 not
 because
 the


financial
 logic
 is
 not
 there
 not
 because


blah
 blah
 blah
 but
 because
 of
 chemistry


of
 people
 not
 agreeing
 on
 governance
 or


or
 their
 own
 roles
 so
 it's
 a
 Pity
 and


then
 during
 a
 crisis


there
 is
 a
 winner
 and
 loser
 and


therefore
 that
 kind
 of
 emotions
 goes
 out


of
 the
 equation
 and
 that's
 the
 reason


you
 have
 the
 deals
 so
 now
 we
 are
 one


year
 later
 what
 are
 your
 priorities
 at


this
 stage
 phase
 one
 was
 the
 integration


the
 biggest
 priority
 right
 now
 is
 to
 go


into
 the
 merger
 of
 the
 operating


entities
 so-call
 parent
 company
 Banks


UBS
 AG
 credit
 Swiss
 AG
 you
 can
 imagine


we
 have
 credit
 Swiss
 is
 bringing
 around


600
 legal
 entities
 is
 into
 the
 UBS


framework
 so
 we
 need
 to
 mer
 good
 time


for
 Swiss
 lawyers
 moving
 on
 a
 bit
 what


is
 it
 about
 Switzerland
 and


banking
 It's
 a


combination
 first
 of
 all
 had
 completely


changed
 and
 evolved
 in
 the
 last
 30
 40


years
 when
 I
 started
 my
 career
 at
 15
 was


uh
 all
 based
 on
 banking
 secrecy
 and
 uh


and


discretion
 and
 uh
 and
 now
 is
 it's
 all


about
 having
 Professional
 Services
 uh
 I


would
 say
 it's
 a
 combination
 of
 of
 that


but
 also
 uh
 the
 reliability
 of
 of
 the


Swiss
 political
 system


uh
 the
 kind
 of
 neut
 it's
 not
 really
 the


neutrality
 it's
 more
 about
 the
 stability


of
 the
 political
 and
 and
 uh
 the
 rule
 of


law
 that
 allows
 people
 the
 strengths
 of


the
 Swiss
 rank
 as
 as
 a
 currency
 also


gives
 a
 lot
 of
 confidence
 to
 people
 so
 I


think
 it
 takes
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 um
 you
 know


um
 uh
 re
 reasons
 to
 get
 why
 Switzerland


is
 as
 big
 as
 you
 know
 it
 is
 uh
 U


punching
 well
 above
 its
 weight
 but
 not


only
 in
 banking
 I
 if
 you
 look
 at
 Pharma


you
 look
 at
 Food
 you
 look
 at
 Innovation


the
 universities
 Switzerland
 is
 a


country
 that
 punches
 well
 above
 its


weights
 yeah
 why
 is
 that
 you
 think
 I
 I


think
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 invest
 a
 lot
 in


in
 education
 I
 mean
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 we
 have
 a
 pretty
 flexible
 and
 Dynam


IC
 labor
 market
 and
 a
 very
 good


education
 system
 which
 are
 the


prerequisite
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be


successful
 in
 uh


nowadays
 one
 other
 thing
 that
 I
 think
 is


interesting
 is
 just
 since
 I
 started
 to


work
 in
 finance
 in
 London
 uh
 us


investment
 banks
 have
 pretty
 much
 wiped


away
 so
 much
 of
 the
 European
 competition


why
 why
 do
 you
 think
 that
 is
 so
 during


the
 financial
 crisis
 the
 facto
 U
 with


all
 the
 uh
 the
 constraint
 and
 the


Lessons
 Learned
 us
 Regulators
 put
 on


their
 US
 Banks
 one
 thing
 they
 made
 it


clear
 they
 wanted
 US
 Banks
 to
 continue


to
 be
 or
 to
 be
 uh
 the
 leading
 Force


going
 forward
 in
 in
 in
 in
 in
 the


financial
 services
 industry
 and
 so
 they


allow
 them
 to
 grow
 Europe
 did
 the


contrary
 Europe
 did
 everything
 they


could
 have
 done
 to
 uh
 to
 don't
 allow
 uh


Banks
 to
 be
 uh
 bigger
 or
 successful


so
 and
 and
 and
 the
 fragmentation
 of


Europe
 also
 from


a
 political
 not
 political
 but
 I
 would


say
 a
 regulatory
 and
 SL
 political


standpoint
 of
 view
 without
 a
 capital


Market
 Union
 without
 a
 banking
 Union
 has


prevented
 the
 creation
 of
 strong
 and


alternative
 uh
 players
 uh
 so
 the
 reason


why
 we
 are
 now
 emerging
 as
 a
 uh
 uh
 David


versus
 goolia
 is
 because
 we
 are
 a
 more


capital
 L
 we
 we
 are
 able
 to
 uh
 you
 know


of
 course
 the
 Swiss
 business
 is
 very


profitable
 but
 it's
 a
 9
 million
 people


country
 so
 it's
 it
 can
 really
 be
 as
 big


as
 any
 major
 countries
 but
 because
 our


strength
 is
 the
 the
 wealth
 management


asset
 Gathering
 angle
 so
 few
 few
 other


banks
 in
 Europe
 can
 do
 that
 but
 I
 do


think
 that
 uh
 there
 is
 a
 a
 political
 uh


uh
 desire
 to


not
 allow
 Banks
 to
 become
 too
 big
 still


a
 lot
 of
 parochial
 thinking
 in
 Europe


about
 being
 big
 Banks
 so
 each
 each
 wants


to
 have
 their
 own
 national
 champions


forgetting
 that
 winning
 the
 the
 national


championships
 doesn't
 take
 you
 very
 far


in
 terms
 of
 global
 same
 same
 with


Airlines
 yeah
 how
 how
 important
 has
 the


Cora
 culture
 of
 UBS
 been
 and
 what
 is
 I


mean
 how
 would
 you
 define
 the
 corpa


culture
 UBS
 versus
 other
 Banks
 I
 think


that
 we
 try
 to
 be
 very
 clear
 to
 our


people
 and
 uh
 it's
 funny
 because
 when
 I


started
 in
 2011
 2012
 I
 was
 confronted


with
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 uh
 criticism
 by


external
 people
 even
 internally
 about


where
 the
 culture
 of
 the
 bank
 banks
 in


general
 the
 culture
 of
 the
 bank
 not
 not


good
 culture
 blah
 blah
 blah
 so
 I
 try
 to


really
 say
 but
 is
 it
 true
 is
 it
 true


that
 we
 don't
 have
 a
 culture
 and
 when
 I


started
 to
 look
 bottom
 up
 and
 top
 down


what
 we
 stand
 for
 I
 realize
 that
 we
 had


clearly
 some
 common
 uh
 commonalities
 and


things
 that
 we
 could
 build
 on
 so
 what
 we


did
 is
 to
 really
 make
 a
 big


differentiations
 between
 okay
 now
 we


look
 at
 people
 in
 terms
 of
 not
 only


compensation
 but
 promotions
 in
 scoring


uh
 alongside
 what
 people
 do
 and
 how
 they


achieve
 their
 results
 and
 giving
 two


scores
 making
 sure
 that
 in
 order
 to
 be
 a


successful
 leader


or
 member
 of
 the
 team
 going
 forward
 you


can
 be
 just
 great
 in


one
 or
 the
 other
 you
 need
 to
 be
 good
 at


both
 you've
 said
 that
 um
 we
 need


teamwork
 but
 we
 cannot
 be
 friends
 all


the
 time
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 by


that
 well
 friends
 are
 not
 I
 mean
 I
 take


my
 analogy
 from
 Sports
 and
 when
 I
 was


playing
 young
 I
 mean
 it's
 not
 like
 every


teammate
 was
 a
 friend
 but
 uh
 you
 know


but
 we
 had
 to
 have
 one
 thing
 in
 common


we
 wanted
 to
 win
 the
 game
 and
 we
 wanted


to
 make
 sure
 that
 all
 the
 people
 on
 the


pitch
 would
 follow
 and
 give
 100%
 so
 so


that's
 what
 I
 mean
 is
 that
 H
 we
 need
 to


have
 common
 understanding
 of
 what
 we


stand
 for
 and
 our
 goals
 and
 and
 uh
 we


need
 to
 leave
 out
 the
 more
 emotional


part
 the
 Friendship
 part
 if
 it
 comes


it's
 good
 I
 mean
 my
 God
 I
 mean
 it's


absolutely
 better
 to
 have
 it
 that
 way


and
 in
 some
 cases
 it
 can
 be
 also


dangerous
 because
 you
 know
 when
 when
 you


develop
 too
 deep
 of
 a
 personal


relationship
 at
 work
 it
 may
 over
 time
 be


a
 conflicting
 element
 that
 doesn't
 allow


you
 to
 be
 uh
 a
 credible
 leader
 uh
 an


unbiased
 leader
 so
 you
 have
 to
 pay


attention
 all
 the
 time
 how
 how
 you


balance
 the
 two
 the
 two
 factors
 but
 of


course
 you
 know
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 that
 uh


what
 I
 saw
 in
 the
 US
 is
 I
 don't
 know
 if


you
 heard
 that
 anecdote
 is


fantastic
 uh
 a
 colleague
 of
 ours
 uh
 was


uh
 lost
 for
 the
 second
 time
 his
 kidney


and
 so
 he
 needed
 desperately
 to
 find
 a


second
 one
 and
 he
 got
 a
 group
 of
 UBS


people
 volunteering
 to
 donate
 the
 kidney


wow
 so
 it
 must
 be
 that
 something's
 there


developed
 Beyond
 being
 just
 a
 colleague


right
 so
 and
 you
 know
 I
 have
 nothing


against
 that
 but
 of
 course
 it's
 not


something
 that
 we
 should
 force
 as
 an


organization
 no
 you
 have
 been
 tasked


also
 to
 find
 your
 own
 successor
 how
 do


you
 go
 about
 doing
 that
 well
 it's
 not


really
 I'm
 part
 of
 the
 process
 like
 I


was
 last
 time
 the
 responsibility
 is
 for


the
 board
 and
 it's
 it's
 really
 premature


because
 right
 now
 I
 mean
 I
 made
 a


commitment
 and
 the
 board
 wants
 me
 to
 to


stay
 till
 the
 integration
 is
 over
 so


very
 minimum
 the
 end
 of
 2026
 and
 then


early
 part
 of


2027
 and
 I
 think
 that
 you
 know
 it's
 it's


part
 of
 of
 of
 my
 job
 the
 COO
 job
 to
 be


to


offer
 a
 numbers
 of
 candidates
 right
 so


one
 has
 to
 be
 realistic
 nowadays
 to
 to


have
 more
 than
 two
 or
 three
 credible


candidates
 is
 not
 easy
 how
 do
 you
 well


why
 is
 it
 not


easy
 yeah
 because
 I
 mean
 you
 got
 how


many
 how
 many
 thousand
 people
 have
 you


got
 in
 the
 bank
 now
 no
 but
 that's


exactly
 the
 point
 is
 is
 because
 no


matter
 I
 mean
 as
 you
 as
 as
 you
 go
 up
 uh


I'm
 sure
 you
 appreciate
 that
 you
 have


maybe
 a
 lot
 of
 very
 talented
 people
 a


lot
 of
 specialized
 people
 so
 it's
 not


easy
 to
 find
 the
 people
 that
 can
 then


take
 a
 broader
 and
 more
 complete
 um


understanding
 of
 the
 business
 and
 and


you
 know
 it's
 not
 just
 a
 technical


issues
 also
 there
 is
 the
 uh
 the


leadership
 uh
 the
 emotional
 leadership


uh
 the
 knowledge
 uh
 the
 ability
 to
 leave


with


stress
 uh
 the
 ability
 to
 make
 decisions


so
 you
 narrow
 down


that
 you
 know
 when
 you
 go
 down
 in
 the


organization
 you
 can
 have
 extremely
 you


know
 talented
 people
 and
 and
 and
 and
 and


great
 professionals
 but
 it's
 not
 always


easy
 to
 then
 translate
 all
 of
 them
 into


uh
 broad
 leaders
 for
 a
 more
 complex


business
 so
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you


develop
 them
 for
 me
 the
 most
 important


issue
 which
 I
 took
 from
 my
 days
 at
 Mar


Lynch
 17
 years
 uh
 is
 is
 to
 really


force
 myself
 as
 a
 uh
 as
 a
 the
 manager


and
 and
 and
 force
 also
 every
 each
 of
 us


to
 number
 one
 think
 about
 what
 else
 can


a
 person
 do
 in
 the
 organization
 so
 one


of
 the
 things
 which
 I
 think
 is
 is
 good


in
 my
 team
 that
 a
 big
 number
 of
 the
 team


members
 of
 the
 executive
 board
 could
 do


another
 job
 in
 the
 executive
 team
 so


fungibility
 is
 very
 important
 so
 be


successful
 in
 your
 business
 but
 how
 much


and
 and
 what
 we
 can
 do
 we
 have
 to
 do
 we


have
 to
 push
 people
 at
 in
 any
 level
 on


the
 organization
 to
 move
 around
 to
 do


other


experiences
 because
 I
 think
 at
 the
 very


least
 they
 broaden
 up
 their
 Horizons
 at


the
 very
 least
 you


incentivate
 cross
 collaborations
 in
 the


organization
 but
 eventually
 as
 time
 goes


by
 you
 develop
 better
 managers
 better


more
 rounded
 managers
 how
 long
 time
 is


how
 long
 time
 does
 it
 take
 to
 develop
 a


good


leader
 defining
 good
 leader
 for
 what
 t


ask
 to
 take
 over


UBS
 20


years
 that's
 exactly
 the
 the
 same
 number


as
 James
 Gman
 uh
 said
 yeah
 okay
 but
 it's


very
 simple
 it's
 justes
 no
 but
 it's
 just


you
 take
 20
 you
 start
 let's
 say
 meid
 20


you
 start
 and
 you
 say
 okay
 you
 know
 when


you
 get
 into
 a
 level
 of
 matureness
 and


then
 is
 mid
 40s
 early
 50s
 so
 it
 takes


around
 that
 age
 but
 do
 do
 companies


actually
 start
 that
 early
 I
 mean
 how


many
 companies
 do
 that
 the
 you
 we
 went


we


went
 well
 I
 I
 remember
 M
 they
 were


almost
 at
 a
 point
 in
 time
 doing
 even
 too


much
 of
 moving
 people
 around
 so
 you
 can


argue
 that
 there
 is
 a
 value
 in
 in
 in
 in


stability
 uh
 in
 many
 cases
 I
 found
 that


it's
 more
 difficult
 for
 in
 in
 when
 you


go
 down
 in
 the


organizations
 uh
 managers
 at
 lower


levels
 are
 very
 protective
 of
 their
 best


people
 so
 are
 not
 so
 Keen
 to
 see
 them


going
 somewhere
 else
 in
 in
 the


organization
 so
 what
 I
 try
 to
 do
 not
 as


successfully
 as
 I
 want
 yet
 but
 I
 still


we
 are
 making
 some
 good
 inroad
 is
 to


force
 both
 the
 manager
 and
 the
 employee


to
 mention
 two
 jobs
 they
 would
 want
 to


do
 outside
 their
 comfort
 zone
 so
 in


order
 to
 uh
 to
 avoid
 uh
 the
 feeling
 that


as
 an
 as
 as
 an
 employee
 or
 subordinate


you
 are
 not
 loyal
 to
 your
 boss
 when
 you


say
 that
 you
 would
 like
 to
 do
 something


else
 I
 force
 the
 manager
 also
 to
 say


what
 do
 you
 think
 that
 person
 should
 do


right
 and
 how
 of
 you
 doing
 that
 well
 we


try
 to
 put
 it
 into
 our
 HR
 System
 and


then
 now
 you
 know
 also
 using
 more
 more


and
 more
 the
 CVS
 uh
 the
 artificial


intelligence
 screening
 when
 we
 look
 at


CVS
 and
 we
 look
 at
 uh
 uh
 open
 positions


so
 we
 try
 to
 leverage
 that
 one
 also
 in
 a


way
 that
 when
 we
 have
 a
 talented
 person


that
 says
 they
 would
 like
 to
 do


something
 else
 when
 we
 say
 okay
 it's


time
 to
 force
 in
 some
 cases
 I
 force


myself
 I
 force
 people
 to
 take


unconventional
 views
 on
 on
 new


appointments
 taking
 talents
 from
 other


part
 of
 the


bank


uh
 so
 I
 did
 it
 few
 times
 in
 in
 in
 my


first
 10
 years
 what
 makes
 you
 in


effective
 leader
 I
 would
 say
 at
 the
 end


of
 the


day
 the
 effective
 leader
 is
 the
 one


that's
 leads
 by
 examples
 and
 doesn't


abuse
 The
 Authority
 versus
 the
 uh
 so
 you


can
 get
 away
 with
 uh
 managing
 without


Authority
 so
 I
 mean
 I'm
 not
 asking


people
 to
 do
 things
 that
 they
 don't
 see


me
 doing
 and
 number
 two
 I'm
 using
 very


selectively
 Authority
 so
 I
 try
 to
 to


make
 sure
 that
 people
 smells
 the
 coffee


before
 um
 before
 I
 have
 to
 say
 that
 I


want
 something
 right
 so
 and
 by
 doing


that
 usually
 you
 get
 more
 tractions
 and


results
 and
 tell
 me
 a
 bit
 more
 about
 how


you
 when
 you
 choose
 to
 use
 your


Authority
 and
 when
 you
 don't
 what
 is


what
 other
 the


situations
 in
 general
 when
 I
 lose
 my


patient
 and
 and
 it's
 is
 when
 I
 think


that
 debate
 debates
 and
 you
 know
 goes
 on


forever
 without
 any
 meaningful
 outcome


then
 I
 step
 and
 use
 more
 of
 the


authority
 right
 is
 that
 the
 Italian


blood
 I
 saw
 many
 nordics
 thinking
 that


way
 in
 my
 in
 my
 so
 it's
 not


so
 what's
 been
 the
 most
 challenging


leadership
 decision
 you
 made
 after
 you


came


back
 decision
 yeah
 well
 it's
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 delicate
 question
 to
 be
 honest


uh
 but
 it's
 always
 around
 people
 yeah


the
 most
 delicate
 and
 most
 complex
 are


always
 around
 people
 people
 the
 one
 you


is
 you
 know
 the
 one
 thing
 I
 I
 learned
 is


that


uh
 eventually
 it's
 always
 in
 my
 career


the
 regret
 is
 not
 having
 taken
 not


necessarily
 just
 always
 negative
 also


positive
 not
 having
 on
 board
 the
 the


right
 person
 earlier
 than
 I
 uh
 than
 I


could
 or
 should
 have
 or
 or
 or
 letting


certain
 people
 in
 the
 job
 longer
 than
 I


should
 have
 you
 know
 the
 biggest
 regret


but


regret
 that
 help
 me
 in
 any
 case
 to


develop
 is
 always
 mainly
 around
 people


rather
 than
 through
 business
 uh


decisions
 you
 mentioned
 that
 um
 coping


with
 stress
 was
 an
 important
 feature
 of


being
 a
 good
 CEO
 how
 do
 you
 cope
 with


stress
 by
 trying
 to
 protect
 my


weekends
 with
 family
 social
 activities


skiing
 um
 I
 I
 am
 the
 the
 president
 of
 a


small
 football
 club
 in
 the
 village
 where


I
 live
 in
 tachino
 in
 Lugano
 so
 you


haven't
 given
 up
 football
 totally
 no
 no


no
 I
 can't
 least
 watch
 it
 and
 um
 I
 ski
 a


lot
 in
 Winter
 um
 so
 I
 I
 really
 try
 to


protect
 uh
 so
 I
 rarely
 rarely
 don't
 go


home
 on
 Friday
 evening
 right
 so
 I
 for
 me


is
 very
 very
 important
 not
 to
 mix


uh
 the
 weekends
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 switching


off
 also
 physically
 what
 I
 do
 is
 really


literally
 I
 don't
 stay
 in
 Zur
 or
 I


always
 go
 to
 ski
 or
 in
 gadin
 or
 I
 go
 to


uh
 the
 beach
 with
 my
 wife
 or
 I
 I
 stay
 in


Lugano
 but
 I
 don't
 stay
 a
 lot
 in
 Zur


during
 the
 weekend
 because
 but
 you


manage
 to
 take
 the
 whole
 weekend
 off


Saturday
 and
 Sunday
 not
 the
 full
 weekend


you
 mean
 not
 touching
 emails
 not
 no
 it's


almost
 impossible
 right
 but
 it's
 a


different
 way
 to
 work
 when
 you're
 home


over
 the


weekend
 what
 um
 we
 have
 um
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 young
 people
 listening
 to


this
 what
 would
 be
 your
 advice
 to
 young


people
 well
 look
 the
 advice
 is
 always


the
 same
 in
 my
 point
 of
 view
 first
 of


all
 you
 know
 it
 goes
 without
 saying
 and


probably
 the
 new
 generation
 don't
 need


too
 much
 of
 that
 advice
 but
 you
 know


just
 you
 have
 to
 be
 passionate
 for
 what


you
 do
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 I
 never
 really


did
 anything
 because
 I
 wanted
 to
 be
 a


CEO
 right
 I
 mean
 first
 of
 all
 you
 must


be
 quite
 sick
 if
 you
 think
 about
 early


on
 your
 you
 I
 want
 to
 be
 a
 my
 maybe
 is
 a


is
 a


dream
 but
 it's
 very
 few
 people
 make
 it


so
 you
 need
 to
 work
 and
 enjoy
 what
 you


do
 and
 be
 successful
 and
 over
 time
 maybe


a
 career
 comes
 if
 you
 just
 work
 to
 for


having
 a
 career
 or
 for
 the
 money
 it's


not
 going
 to
 be
 very
 uh
 very
 very
 nice


so
 be
 passionate
 about
 what
 you
 do
 I


remember
 when
 I
 was
 very
 young
 I
 was


waiting
 for
 the
 Monday
 to
 go
 back
 into


the
 bank
 and
 and
 Tra
 and
 being
 and


trading
 right
 and
 for
 me
 that
 was
 a


passion
 and
 the
 second
 one
 I
 would
 say


uh
 be


flexible
 and
 Mobile
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 uh


making
 experiences
 outside
 your
 comfort


zone
 particularly
 the
 physical
 one
 it's


very
 easy
 today
 you
 know
 you
 always
 have


an
 excuse
 uh
 boyfriend
 girlfriend


whatever
 you
 have
 uh
 uh
 uh
 your
 your


your
 comfort
 zone
 but
 you
 know
 making


international
 experiences
 going
 out
 and


work
 somewhere


else
 and
 in
 a
 in
 an
 uncomfortable
 Zone


you
 know
 having
 to
 learn
 a
 new
 language


having
 to
 do
 something
 that
 challenges


you
 uh
 it's
 it's
 very
 is
 very
 important


to
 to
 to
 develop
 uh
 the


personality
 and
 also
 potentially
 also


from
 a
 professional
 standpoint
 of
 view


it
 goes
 without
 saying
 that
 the
 last


things
 I
 I
 do
 say
 I
 don't
 know
 about
 in


uh
 constantly
 to
 our
 people
 at
 UBS
 we


invest
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 in
 uh
 in
 keeping


our
 people
 up
 to
 speed
 with
 the
 best
 uh


developments
 uh
 to
 to
 train
 them
 to


educate
 them
 we
 have
 plenty
 of
 courses


and
 but
 the
 first
 one
 once
 needs
 to
 do


investment
 in
 in
 itself
 is
 is
 the
 person


don't
 rely
 on
 on
 the
 state
 don't
 rely
 on


your


company
 to
 make
 you
 a
 competitive
 person


in
 the
 labor
 market
 rely
 on
 yourself


yeah
 we
 can
 help
 you
 we
 can
 support
 you


but
 don't
 rely
 on
 us
 well
 soio
 you
 um


for
 sure
 have
 relied
 on
 yourself
 you


have
 shown
 huge
 passion
 in
 in
 UBS
 and
 in


your
 country
 and
 for
 sure
 you've
 shown


agility
 by
 and
 flexibility
 by
 coming


back
 for
 a
 second
 stunt
 so
 big


congratulation
 and
 it's
 been
 wonderful


to
 talking
 to
 you
 thank
