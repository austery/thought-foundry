suppos
 to
 wait
 there
 he
 is
 his
 hand
 went


down
 I
 want
 to
 thank
 Greg
 for
 sharing


his
 knowledge
 with
 us
 today
 and
 Nikolai


and
 nbim
 for
 hosting
 us
 today
 and
 when
 I


was
 offered
 the
 chance
 to
 discuss


investment
 philosophy
 I
 said
 there's
 no


way
 I'd
 rather
 spend
 my
 birthday


[Music]


I'm
 extremely
 interested
 in
 investment


philosophy
 uh
 I
 think
 it
 has
 to


undergird
 everything
 we
 do
 my
 argument


is
 that
 our
 Behavior
 has
 to
 be
 uh
 well


thought
 out
 and
 intentional
 uh
 and
 so


our
 methodology
 has
 to
 be
 as
 well
 um
 and


um
 uh
 you'll
 hear
 that
 it's
 different


but
 at
 least
 we
 have
 thought
 it
 out
 and


it
 is
 intentional


um
 it
 starts
 with
 uh
 a
 conscious


decision
 as
 to
 what
 you
 want
 to


accomplish
 now
 this
 may
 sound
 easy
 well


we
 want
 to
 have
 more
 money
 rather
 than


less
 we
 want
 to
 have
 a
 higher
 return


rather
 than
 less
 uh
 but
 the
 the
 starting


question
 for
 any
 organization
 in


investing
 should


be
 will
 we
 will
 we
 settle
 for
 average
 or


do
 we
 want
 to
 try
 to
 be
 above
 average


now
 that
 sounds
 like
 an
 easy
 one
 but
 you


have
 to
 recognize
 that
 investing
 it's


extremely
 easy
 to
 be
 average
 you
 can
 buy


off-the-shelf
 products
 that
 will


guarantee
 you
 that
 you'll
 do
 average
 or


you
 can
 try
 to
 be
 above
 average
 which
 is


extremely
 difficult
 and
 there
 is
 no


shorefire
 uh
 solution
 to
 how
 to
 get


there
 and
 if
 you
 try
 to
 be
 above
 average


it
 exposes
 you
 to
 the
 risk
 of
 being


below
 average
 the
 two
 are
 inseparable
 so


thoughtfully


consciously
 intentionally
 which
 is
 it


for
 you
 and
 your


organization
 uh
 next
 um
 you
 I
 believe


that
 an
 organization
 has
 to
 have
 a
 Creed


a
 religion
 the
 things
 it
 believes
 in
 the


things
 it
 doesn't
 believe
 in
 the
 things


it
 will
 do
 the
 things
 it
 won't
 do


because
 it
 doesn't
 trust
 them
 and
 you


have
 to
 stick
 to
 it
 and
 uh
 again
 it
 has


to
 be
 conscious
 and
 intentional
 now
 I


wish
 the
 print
 was
 big
 so
 I
 could
 see
 it


I
 uh
 I
 could
 probably
 see
 it
 if
 I
 do
 a


little
 bit
 of
 this
 but
 um
 but
 the
 truth


is
 we
 have
 to
 make
 decisions
 what
 will


be
 our
 intention
 what
 do
 we
 believe
 in


will
 we
 trust
 macro
 forecasting
 or
 will


we
 uh
 abstain
 from
 it
 will
 we


um
 pardon
 me
 uh
 uh
 how
 do
 you
 think


about
 risk
 will
 you
 take
 a
 highrisk


approach
 or
 a
 lowrisk
 approach
 which
 is


your
 rot
 rout
 uh
 to
 uh
 success
 it
 it's


not
 the
 same
 for
 everybody
 um
 do
 you


believe
 in
 the
 efficient
 market
 this
 is


extremely
 important
 it's
 uh
 the
 most


important
 concept
 I
 took
 away
 from
 my
 uh


graduate
 uh
 education
 at
 the
 University


of
 Chicago
 in
 the
 late
 60s
 um
 uh
 many


people
 understand
 the
 concept
 very
 few


people
 incorporate
 it
 and
 think
 about
 it


in
 their
 daily
 lives
 these
 are
 some
 of


the
 things
 that
 we
 have
 to
 consider
 so


let's
 talk
 first
 about
 the
 concept
 of


market
 efficiency
 now
 uh
 the
 the
 theory


of
 market
 efficiency
 is
 that
 there
 are
 a


lot
 of
 people
 out
 there
 and
 they're
 all


numerate
 intelligent
 highly
 motivated


objective
 and
 rational
 and
 they
 all
 want


to
 accomplish
 the
 thing
 you
 do
 which
 is


to
 end
 up
 with
 more
 money
 than
 you


started


with
 given


the
 scope
 of


competition
 how
 will
 you
 be
 the
 one
 who


accomplishes
 the
 goal
 rather
 than
 them


not
 easily
 uh
 thought
 out
 um
 now
 the
 the


uh
 what
 we
 call
 the
 uh
 strong
 form
 of


the
 efficient
 market
 hypothesis
 says


that
 due
 to
 these


circumstances
 all
 information
 is


immediately
 incorporated
 into
 the
 price


of


assets
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 no
 one
 person


can
 figure
 out
 uh
 which
 are
 the
 bargains


and
 which
 are
 the


overpricing
 now
 the
 the
 really
 strong


form
 is
 actually
 a
 little
 different
 it


says
 that
 the
 prices
 of
 assets
 as
 a


result
 of
 this
 intensive
 uh
 process
 are


always
 right
 you
 can't
 beat
 them
 and
 so


you
 can't
 beat
 the
 market
 now
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 right
 I
 think
 the
 prices


are
 not
 necessarily
 right
 they're
 just


the
 best
 that
 the
 consensus
 can
 do
 and


it's
 hard
 for
 any
 one
 person
 to
 be


smarter
 than
 the
 consensus
 consistently


two
 different
 things
 but
 the
 um
 but
 the


bottom
 line
 on
 both
 is
 the
 same
 you


can't
 beat
 the
 market
 so
 the
 question
 is


do
 you
 accept
 that
 and
 that
 that
 pushes


you
 toward
 a
 passive
 approach
 targeting


uh
 average
 performance
 low
 cost
 low
 risk


highly
 likely
 to
 succeed
 to
 approach
 to


to
 accomplish
 your
 objective
 which
 is


being
 average


or
 will
 you
 try
 to
 be
 above
 average
 in


the
 face
 of
 the
 very
 strong
 competition


that
 exists
 will
 you
 endure
 the
 costs


will
 your
 pursuit
 of
 being
 above
 average


uh
 permit
 you
 to
 be
 exposed
 to
 the
 risk


of
 being
 below
 average
 and
 will
 you


engage
 in
 this
 pursuit
 of
 superior


performance
 uh
 which
 is
 not
 that
 likely


to
 succeed
 U
 you
 know
 the
 first
 thing
 I


learned
 at
 University
 of
 Chicago
 was


that
 on
 average
 most
 most
 people
 do


average
 before
 fees
 and
 below
 average


after
 fees
 and
 the
 thought
 at
 the
 time


1968
 was
 well
 why
 don't
 they
 just
 buy


one
 share
 of
 every
 stock
 in
 the
 S&P
 500


there
 was
 no
 discussion
 of
 index
 funds


or
 indexation
 these
 had
 yet
 to
 be


invented
 Jack
 basically
 by
 Jack
 Bogle
 at


Vanguard
 in
 74
 but
 you
 can
 see
 where
 the


concept
 went
 and
 uh
 today
 most
 uh
 mutual


fund
 Equity
 Capital
 has
 managed
 past
 ly


or
 through
 indexation
 so
 it
 it
 was
 not


irrelevant
 it
 was


persuasive
 will
 you
 try
 to
 be
 active
 and


be
 above
 average
 or
 passive
 and
 be


average
 do
 you
 uh
 have
 the
 uh
 people
 in


hand
 who
 can
 accomplish
 it
 or
 the


ability
 to
 find
 those
 people
 and
 and


hire
 them
 as
 outside
 managers


um
 what
 happens
 uh
 at
 the
 moment


when
 uh
 you
 know


uh
 average
 performance
 is
 X
 and
 a
 few


people
 publish
 performance
 which
 is
 much


better
 and
 your
 bosses
 say
 who's
 the


idiot
 who
 signed
 on
 for
 average


performance
 um
 so
 these
 are


questions
 but
 it's
 very
 fundamental
 to


the
 selection
 of
 an
 investment
 approach


to
 understand
 and
 reflect
 the
 concept
 of


market


efficiency
 the
 next
 is
 coming
 where


is
 knowing
 where
 uh
 Returns
 come


from
 um
 you
 can
 have
 an
 average


portfolio
 and
 do
 average
 or
 you
 can
 say


well
 this
 is
 a
 company
 that
 I
 think
 is


going
 to
 deliver
 positive
 news
 which
 is


unanticipated
 by
 others
 positive


surprises
 and
 if
 you
 can
 uh
 figure
 out


which
 ones
 will
 deliver
 positive


surprises
 you
 can
 overweight
 your


portfolio
 uh
 toward
 those
 and
 then
 when


the
 news
 comes
 out
 and
 it
 can
 forms
 with


your
 view
 uh
 everybody
 else
 says
 oh
 I


wish
 I
 had
 more
 they
 go
 out
 and
 buy
 it


that
 forces
 the
 price
 up
 you
 are
 an


above
 average
 performer
 so
 that's
 the


root
 how
 uh
 regularly
 can
 it
 be


accomplished
 that's
 the
 question
 if
 you


think
 different
 from
 others
 you
 have


what
 we
 call
 a
 deviant
 perception


deviant


perception
 how
 often
 will
 you
 be
 right


as
 opposed
 to
 the
 consensus
 being
 right


and
 you
 being
 wrong
 um
 uh
 this
 is
 uh
 at


the
 heart
 of
 things
 again
 you're
 up


against
 intelligent
 competition
 and
 uh


you
 know
 when
 I
 started
 my
 career
 at
 a


large
 and
 bureaucratic
 institution
 uh
 in


the
 equity
 Department
 people
 would
 ask


well
 what
 do
 you
 think
 you
 can
 make
 for


us
 and
 the
 answer
 was


12%
 well
 how
 do
 you
 arrive
 at
 12
 well


the
 S&P
 500
 does
 10
 on
 average
 has
 done


at
 that
 point
 in
 time
 for
 60
 years
 so
 if


you
 can
 get
 10
 without
 any
 effort
 you


should
 be
 able
 to
 get
 well
 let's
 say
 two


20%
 better
 with
 a
 little
 elbow
 grease
 in


other
 words
 12
 but
 what
 if
 all
 the
 elbow


grease
 in
 the
 world
 doesn't
 accomplish


anything
 because
 the
 Market's
 efficient


and
 you
 can't
 get
 an
 advantage
 then
 it's


not
 only
 a
 waste
 of
 effort
 but
 it's
 a


waste
 of
 management
 fees
 uh
 that
 and
 of


course
 management
 fees
 are
 the
 only


certainty
 in
 the
 investing


world
 now
 another
 important
 question
 is


will
 you
 bet
 on
 macro


forecasts
 everybody
 makes
 macro


forecasts
 and
 yet
 I
 don't
 believe
 that


they
 are
 of
 any
 use
 that's
 a
 mild


exaggeration
 but
 not
 so
 great
 um
 the


truth
 of
 the
 matter
 is
 that
 most
 of
 the


time
 things
 continue
 as
 they
 are
 so
 a


forecast
 of
 extrapolation
 is
 correct


most
 of
 the
 time
 and
 most
 people
 share


that
 view
 most
 people
 expect


extrapolation
 extrapolation
 of
 the


recent
 Trends
 the
 long-term
 trends
 is


Incorporated
 in
 security


prices
 so
 when
 the
 extrapolation
 turns


out
 to
 be


correct
 it's
 not
 a
 profitable


expectation
 because
 everybody
 else
 had


it
 as
 well
 it
 was
 in
 the
 price
 you


paid
 the
 forecasts
 that
 are
 very


profitable
 are
 the
 ones
 that
 call
 for
 um


uh
 radical
 deviation
 from
 Trend
 radical


deviation
 from


extrapolation
 these
 are
 very
 significant


when
 you
 make
 them
 and
 they're
 right
 the


trouble
 is
 they're
 not
 right
 very
 often


because
 most
 of
 the
 time
 things
 are


extrapolated
 and
 so
 we
 have
 forecasts
 of


extrapolation
 which
 are
 usually
 correct


but
 not
 profitable
 and
 forecast
 of
 Devi


uh
 deviation
 from
 Trend
 which
 are


potentially
 very
 profitable
 but
 not


often
 correct
 I
 take
 that
 an
 analysis
 to


mean
 macro
 forecasting
 doesn't
 work
 and


uh
 one
 of
 when
 we
 started
 oak
 tree
 29


years
 ago
 this
 month
 uh
 we
 sat
 down
 and


we
 wrote
 out
 the
 things
 we
 had
 been


doing
 because
 we
 had
 the
 benefit
 of


having
 worked
 together
 for
 9
 years


already
 on
 average
 and
 uh
 we
 have
 a
 very


simple
 investment
 philosophy
 of
 six


points
 which
 governs
 everything
 we
 do


and
 number
 five
 says
 that
 our
 actions


are
 not
 driven
 by
 macro
 forecasts
 we
 are


bottomup
 investors
 selecting
 IND


individual
 companies
 not
 top
 down


selecting
 markets
 and
 countries
 so


that's
 a
 different
 we
 think
 we
 can
 get


an
 uh
 an
 advantage
 by
 the
 way
 where
 does


outperforming
 come
 from
 in
 short
 it


comes
 from
 having
 a
 a
 knowledge


advantage
 and
 you
 have
 to
 know
 something


better
 than
 most
 other
 people
 to
 to


outperform
 just
 trying
 is
 not
 going
 to


help
 you
 if
 you
 don't
 know
 something


they
 don't
 know
 so


um
 we
 think
 we
 can
 get
 a
 knowledge


advantage
 in
 studying
 the
 micro


companies
 Industries
 and
 securities
 not


the
 macro
 countries
 markets
 and
 rates


for
 example
 so
 you
 know
 we
 bar
 that
 from


our
 approach
 I
 one
 of
 my
 heroes
 is
 John


Kenneth
 gallb
 who
 said
 we
 have
 two
 kinds


of
 forecasters
 the
 ones
 who
 don't
 know


and
 the
 ones
 who
 don't
 know
 they
 don't


know
 and
 I've
 known
 for
 decades
 that
 I


don't
 know
 so
 I
 think
 we
 have
 an


advantage
 in
 that
 and
 then
 uh
 that
 kind


of
 sounds
 like
 forecasting
 macro


forecasting
 is
 unavail
 unavailing
 but


the
 truth
 is
 that
 it
 can
 be
 worse
 than


neutral
 in
 its
 effect
 it
 can
 be
 damaging


in
 its
 effect
 and
 I
 quote
 the
 American


humorist
 and
 novelist
 uh
 Mark
 Twain
 who


said
 it
 ain't
 what
 you
 don't
 know
 that


gets
 you
 into
 trouble
 it's
 what
 you
 know


for
 certain
 that
 just
 ain't


true
 no
 sentence
 that
 starts
 with
 I


don't
 know
 but
 or
 I
 could
 be
 wrong
 but


ever
 got
 anybody
 into
 trouble


the
 ones
 that
 get
 you
 into
 trouble
 are


the
 ones
 that
 say
 I'm
 sure
 that's
 such


and
 such
 because
 if
 you
 believe


something
 strongly
 and
 You
 Bet
 On
 It


heavily
 and
 you're
 wrong
 that's
 how
 you


get
 into
 big


trouble
 so
 will
 you
 bet
 on
 macro


forecasting
 this
 in
 my
 opinion
 is
 a


critical
 and
 and
 uh
 overarching
 decision


I
 wrote
 a
 memo
 U
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago
 I


think
 it
 was
 October
 of
 22
 um
 entitled


the
 illusion
 of
 knowledge


and
 it's
 a
 it's
 basically
 a
 rant
 against


uh
 uh
 macro
 forecasting
 starting
 with
 a


macro
 for
 a
 famous
 quote
 in
 each
 section


um
 and
 uh
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 extremely


important
 to
 decide
 will
 you
 or
 won't


you
 start
 from
 a
 top-
 down
 macro


forecast
 and
 most
 people
 do
 many
 people


know
 they
 don't
 work
 they
 do
 it
 anyway


and
 one
 of
 the
 I
 quote
 somebody
 in
 there


as
 saying
 that
 most
 people
 couldn't
 get


out
 of
 bed
 in
 the
 morning
 if
 they


admitted
 how
 uncertain
 the
 the
 future
 is


uh
 and
 so
 I
 believe
 that
 macro


forecasting
 uh
 in
 my
 view
 often
 takes


the
 form
 of
 uh
 can
 I
 say
 organized


religion
 it
 gives
 Something
 to
 Believe


In
 to
 dispel
 uh
 the
 great
 uncertainty
 uh


present
 in
 the
 world
 they
 live
 in
 um
 and


uh
 you
 know
 I
 believe
 that
 uh
 very
 few


people
 have
 the
 ability
 uh
 to
 do
 it
 in
 a


superior
 fashion
 now
 the
 next
 question


is
 how
 will
 you
 and
 your
 organization


think
 about
 risk
 what
 is
 risk
 um
 you


know
 in
 in
 all
 the
 uh
 formula
 uh


mathematical
 work
 in
 the
 investment


business
 people
 use
 variability
 of


results
 as
 the
 measure
 of
 risk
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 the
 real
 risk
 I
 think
 the


real
 risk
 is
 the
 risk
 of
 bad


outcomes
 uh
 but
 um
 the
 trouble
 with
 my


form
 of
 risk
 is
 it's
 not
 measurable


you
 can't
 measure
 what
 the
 probability


of
 bad
 outcomes
 is
 in
 the
 future
 you


can't
 even
 measure
 what
 the
 probability


of
 bad
 outcomes
 was
 in
 the
 past
 you
 can


only
 measure
 what
 happened
 which
 is
 a


subset
 of
 what
 could
 have
 happened
 I
 on


the
 last
 slide
 I
 I
 had
 a
 quote
 from


Elroy
 Dimson
 who
 was
 a
 pressor
 professor


at
 the
 London
 Business
 School
 he
 said


risk
 means
 more
 things
 can
 happen
 than


will
 happen
 the
 conventional
 view
 of


risk
 is
 shown
 in
 this
 graphic
 here
 you


have
 return
 on
 the
 vertical
 axis
 risk
 on


the
 horizontal
 access
 and
 a
 line
 that


swopes
 up
 to
 the
 right
 and


mathematicians
 call
 this
 positive


correlation
 if
 one
 goes
 up
 the
 other


goes
 up
 most
 practitioners
 take
 this
 to


mean
 that
 riskier
 assets
 have
 higher


returns
 there's
 something
 wrong
 with


that
 formulation
 if
 riskier
 assets
 could


be
 counted
 on
 to
 have
 higher
 returns
 by


definition
 they
 wouldn't
 be
 risky
 so
 the


the
 way
 I
 look
 at
 it
 is
 more
 like
 this
 I


take
 these
 little
 bell-shaped
 curves
 I


superimpose
 them
 on
 the
 same
 line
 it's


the
 same
 underlying
 line
 but
 now
 as
 you


move
 from
 left
 to
 right
 not
 only
 does


the
 expected
 return
 increase
 but
 the


range
 of
 possible
 outcomes
 gets
 wider


and
 the
 bad
 outcomes
 become
 worse
 that
 I


think
 is
 risk
 that
 is
 what
 people
 should


concern
 themselves
 not
 the
 possibility


that
 their
 return
 streams
 will
 be
 lumpy


Buffett
 said
 I'd
 rather
 have
 a
 lumpy
 15


than
 a
 smooth
 12
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 that


makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense


so
 I
 think
 the
 most
 important
 job
 of
 the


professional
 investor
 is
 to
 manage
 risk


and
 uh
 you
 know
 Greg
 in
 his
 talk
 said


what
 do
 you
 believe
 in
 and
 I
 think


that's
 very
 important
 and
 you
 you
 could


hear
 in
 his
 presentation
 how
 much
 of
 the


time
 they
 devote
 to
 assessing
 managing


and
 balancing
 risk
 and
 we
 have
 to
 do
 the


same
 thing
 we
 have
 to
 assess
 it
 and


manage
 it
 even
 though
 we
 do
 it
 from
 a


bottomup
 micro
 level
 not
 to
 down
 but
 um


I
 think
 that
 you
 have
 to
 constant
 work


with
 uh
 risk
 but
 you
 have
 to
 never


assume
 as
 Mark
 Twain
 cautions
 uh
 that


you
 know
 it
 for
 certain
 we
 never
 know


what
 is
 going
 to


happen
 and
 the
 events
 show
 that
 in
 the


world
 we
 never
 know
 how
 the
 market
 will


react
 to
 What
 happens
 in
 the
 short
 run


uh
 and
 if
 you
 want
 proof
 of
 those
 two


statements
 take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 US


presidential
 election
 of
 2016
 everybody


was
 confident
 of
 two
 things
 Hillary


would
 win
 80%
 probable
 and
 if
 by
 some


Quirk
 of
 f
 Fe
 Trump
 won
 the
 market
 would


collapse
 instead
 Trump
 won
 and
 the


market
 went
 up
 for
 14
 months
 30%
 so
 we


don't
 know
 and
 uh
 we
 don't
 ever
 assume


that
 our
 uh
 intellectual
 process
 permits


us
 to
 get
 uh
 the
 risk
 under


control
 and
 then
 lastly
 you
 have
 to


accept
 that
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 have
 both


Superior
 returns
 and
 low


risk
 um


uh
 a
 high
 degree
 of
 safety
 taking
 going


for
 Superior
 returns
 meaning
 means


taking
 some
 risk
 you
 have
 to
 either
 bet


on
 riskier
 companies
 riskier


propositions
 things
 that
 are
 considered


unpopular
 and
 out
 of
 favor
 and
 things


that
 if
 you're
 wrong
 will
 result
 in
 your


being
 below


average
 yet
 and
 you
 have
 to
 figure
 out


for
 yourself
 what
 your
 approach
 is
 I'm
 a


player
 and
 last
 summer
 while
 watching
 uh


the
 tennis
 tournaments
 uh
 especially


Wimbleton
 um
 I
 wrote
 a
 memo
 entitled


fewer
 losers
 or
 more


winners
 you
 have
 to
 have
 an
 approach
 in


my
 opinion
 which
 will
 uh
 organize
 your


pursuit
 of
 superior
 returns
 and
 there's


really
 two
 ways
 to
 do
 it
 you
 have
 to


either
 have
 more
 of
 the
 things
 that
 do


above
 average
 or
 less
 than
 the
 less
 of


the
 things
 that
 do
 below
 average
 there


is
 no
 alternative
 of
 course
 you
 could
 do


both
 I
 think
 for
 most
 people
 given
 their


mentality
 one
 or
 the
 other
 is
 more


likely
 the
 the
 the
 conservative
 person


can
 in
 theory
 have
 fewer
 of
 the
 things


that
 do
 poorly
 the
 skilled
 aggressive


person
 can
 in
 theory
 have
 more
 of
 the


things
 that
 do


well
 each
 person
 has
 to
 understand
 their


own
 mentality
 what's
 possible
 for
 them


and
 thus
 their
 Pursuit
 will
 what
 their


Pursuit
 will
 be
 and
 these
 things
 in
 my


opinion
 taken
 together
 are
 examples
 of


the
 elements
 that
 combine
 to
 produce
 uh


an
 investment
 philosophy
 and
 we've
 done


it
 at
 Oaky
 everybody
 knows
 where
 we


stand
 everybody
 is
 pulling
 together
 in


the
 same
 direction
 thank
 you
 very
 much
