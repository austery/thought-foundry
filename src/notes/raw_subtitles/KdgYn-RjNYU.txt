 It's
 a

 more


mixed
 with
 both
 locally

Focus
 small

 And
 Also
 some


region

 and
 Sector

 The


Thing
 is
 that
 we
 look
 for
 specialists


that
 know
 a
 few
 areas
 very
 well


we
 have
 today
 110
 managers
 in
 50


different
 cities
 across
 the
 World
 We


strongly
 Believe
 in
 the
 information


advantage
 of
 being
 on

 we
 Seek

maintain

 Visiting
 on

 So
 our
 aim
 is
 to
 generate


Excess

 as
 of
 last
 year
 we
 have


generated


1.8%
 annualized
 Excess
 Return
 of
 the

 and
 over
 time
 only

 3%
 in

 that
 is
 80%
 of

 return
 is


kept

n
 we
 also
 believe
 that
 the
 external


managers
 will
 reduce
 The
 Risk
 of
 over


investments
 by
 avoiding
 certain


companies


with
 problematic
 business
 models
 and


weak
 corporate
 governance
 in
 these


markets
 and
 These

 or
 These


managers
 they

 is

to

 and
 That

performance

 very


frequently
 we

 and


second
 not
 an

 inim


that
 decides


Which
 man
 that
 should


be
 should
 be
 awarded
 a

eh
 but
 an
 individual

manager
 Bim
 or
 we
 have
 said
 that


employing
 external
 managers
 is
 an


investment
 decision
 and
 investment


decisions
 should
 not
 be
 made
 in
 group


settings
 So
 we
 are
 eight
 people
 in
 the


team
 selecting
 managers
 and
 each
 of
 us


in
 the
 team
 are
 forf
 managers
 Who
 are


responsible
 for
 Selection
 and


termination
 Within

one

maker
 for

 We
 don't


use
 consultants
 to

us
 several
 of


them
 in


knowledge


eh
 several


managers
 but
 we
 are
 in
 a
 different


position
 than
 many
 of
 the
 other


clients
 so
 we
 have
 to
 decided
 to
 dig


Deep
 over


s
 to
 know
 every
 aspect
 of
 the
 manager


portfolio
 philosophy
 and
 the
 interaction


in
 the
 team
 Because
 we
 are
 striving
 to


create
 a
 portfolio
 of
 different


portfolio
 managers
 that
 fit
 Well


together
 with
 different
 Focus
 and


different
 Investment
 universes


So
 what
 do
 we


do
 we
 follow
 quite
 structured
 Selection


process
 starts
 with
 a
 short
 question
 to


Potential
 managers
 with
 questions
 the


organ


Teams
 and
 the
 full

in

 as

competitors
 this
 information
 is
 us
 to


get


better
 insight
 into
 additional


managers
 based
 on
 that
 we
 have
 huge


dataset
 with
 Potential
 managers
 and
 can


do
 different
 analysis
 on
 the
 actual


portfolios
 the
 Changes
 when
 and
 what


been
 buying
 eh


and
 differences
 between


each
 this

 of

 on

 all
 Invest


Potential


managers
 we
 usually
 Meet
 the
 manag
 three


to
 four
 times
 before
 Selection
 and
 Once


Per
 quarter
 after
 They
 are


Selected
 in
 this
 meeting
 we
 discussed


the
 portfolio
 individual
 companies
 when


they
 met
 the
 management
 of
 the
 companies


where
 they
 misted
 what
 they
 talked
 about


Which
 ESG
 issues
 they
 discussed
 What
 is


priced
 into
 the
 company
 eh
 why
 they
 have


a
 different
 View
 from
 the
 rest
 of
 the


market
 and
 both
 companies
 they
 are


invested
 in
 and
 companies
 they
 have


decided
 to
 stay
 out


of
 all
 the
 meetings


with
 these
 managers
 are
 conducted
 on


site
 we
 never
 meet
 any
 managers
 in
 our


offices
 and
 there
 are
 several
 reason
 for


that
 first
 Is
 We
 prefer
 the
 manager
 to


focus
 on
 the
 investments
 and
 the


portfolio
 travel
 around
 the
 world
 to
 me


us
 the
 second
 is
 that
 By
 seeing
 them
 on


site
 we
 can
 Meet
 the
 whole


Team
 Of
 course
 is
 impossible
 if
 you
 Drag


them
 to


Norway
 and
 the
 third
 is
 that
 when


meeting
 the
 managers
 in
 a
 Country
 We


don't
 only
 Meet
 the
 ones
 that
 you
 have


but
 we
 meet
 all
 the
 existing
 And
 Also


Potential


managers
 so
 we
 can
 compare
 their
 view
 on


markets
 and
 companies


so
 that
 gives
 a
 very
 good
 understanding


of
 the
 managers
 different
 views
 Who


thinks
 differently
 Than
 The
 Rest
 Who
 are


early
 or
 late
 to
 investment
 idees
 Who


are
 engaged
 in

ETC
 when
 looking
 for
 managers
 in
 a


certain
 market
 we
 look
 for
 a
 good


investment
 company
 and
 a
 good
 PF
 manager


with
 the


company
 experience
 is
 return
 is
 to


individuals
 and
 They
 need

 We
 found

individual

 making


the
 overconfidence
 in

with
 lack
 of
 Quality
 and
 seeking


unanimity
 that
 should
 be
 avoided
 in

decisions
 it
 is
 very
 important
 that
 the


portfolio
 manager
 has
 a
 strong
 team


around
 him

 her
 to
 give
 input
 on
 the


stocks
 to
 buy
 and
 the
 stocks

 These

 should

reflected

 we

 We

that

 we

 furthermore
 this

stretching

 Which
 gives

 a


huge

 how
 we


should

 about

 so
 our
 Focus
 is

 based
 on

 the
 regular

 with
 the

 the
 analysis


of

 the
 aim
 is
 to

 Per

 May
 Bring

 but
 also
 May
 Bring
 Us
 Closer


to

 which
 is
 just
 an
 expensive
 way


of
 doing


it
 we
 manag
 the

 quite
 actively


on

 we
 have
 14

 10

 every

 40%
 of

 around

 manager


that
 he

 is


leaving

 the

 et
 CE
 40%


is
 due
 to
 wrong
 Selection
 from
 us
 or


that
 we
 are
 less
 convinced
 about
 their


Excess
 performance
 going
 forward
 for


some
 Reason
 and
 20%
 is
 due
 to
 shifting

 getting
 out

 Regional


managers
 the
 shortest
 We
 had


is
 Two

 That
 was
 the
 portfolio
 manager


that
 left

 after

 and
 the
 longest
 is
 a
