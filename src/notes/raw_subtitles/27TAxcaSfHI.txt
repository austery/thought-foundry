Hello everyone, I am Anthony
Welcome to my channel
Today's video
Let’s continue with yesterday’s topic
Let’s talk about Chinese language education in China
In yesterday's video
We analyzed the teaching methods of Chinese language classes
That is, the same set of explaining new words and dividing paragraphs.
Summarize the main idea and analyze the process of writing characteristics
This mechanical and stereotyped explanation routine
Make it difficult for students to feel
Emotional resonance and touch with the author
It stifles students' ability to grasp the overall article
For example, an essay
The students only remembered this sentence.
Use metaphors, parallelism and other rhetorical devices
But it is difficult to feel the emotions conveyed by the author
Although the teacher will summarize
This article conveys a certain emotion of the author
But this kind of summary is often a forced summary.
Students lack the ability to understand this emotion.
Related knowledge and background
Just to get points
And have to accept the teacher's top-down indoctrination
This not only hinders and suppresses students
Spontaneous interest in reading
It is also easy for students to form
A single, rigid view of truth
That is, only one orthodox interpretation is allowed.
Rejecting other possibilities
That today
Let's talk about another annoying topic.
It's Chinese composition
Let me say one more thing before we start
If you are interested in today's video
or
Do you have any topic you want to discuss with me?
You can contact my email to make an appointment
Let's get back to our topic today.
Speaking of Chinese composition
I think
This is definitely a problem that many Chinese people have when they are students.
One of the most annoying tasks
Students either have nothing to write
Or you can only be forced to write some empty words and false words
Or racking your brains
From the Fanwen
Excerpt some good words and sentences that are all the same
If mathematics brings
Frustration and pain
Writing often makes students feel ashamed.
Although students know
I write essays just for the sake of exam scores
Does not represent real thoughts
But I still can't bear to read what I wrote
I feel ashamed of what I wrote.
Awkward
This subtle sense of shame, embarrassment
Split and conflict due to identity
We say
What a person said
Written text
Whether it is the expression of true emotion
Or is it fabricated due to the need of examination?
can be seen as an extension of the self.
It can also be said that the self as an object
This object of me
It is inevitable that others will give it meaning.
Reviews and Feedback
When the other wants to understand the inner self as a subject
I can only rely on these external objects
And I will also get feedback from others about me.
To know oneself
and build their own identity
However
When the objective self cannot represent the subjective self
While others are still looking at the objective me
I'll feel caught.
I want to escape this feeling of alienation.
That's shame.
That is
I am unwilling to face and acknowledge the objective self
Don't want to see it
Want to get rid of this scene
Shame comes from this inescapable anxiety
Knowing
These words cannot represent my true thoughts
But you have to bear
The social evaluation of these words
It will even be put on public display.
There is reason to believe
This kind of composition education is full of empty words and lies
To many Chinese
All of these have caused long-term and profound writing difficulties.
Even those who dislike Chinese education
them
Although I can stop myself from speaking empty words and lies
But that kind of writing
The ability to express oneself freely and explore oneself
But it is impossible to have it out of thin air
As we said in this video on December 8:
Many Chinese students become adults
Still feel pain in writing
Even writing a simple text at work
Feeling strong resistance
Even the brain is blank
Don't know how to start
Not even good at writing
Words that express your true thoughts
Once you write your true feelings
I feel very ashamed
Writing itself
It can be used as a core means of self-exploration
When a person's true thoughts
When expressed through words
He can experience the feeling of being heard.
Even if it's just for myself
This process of self-listening
Very important for psychological integration
But the composition of Chinese primary and secondary schools
To a large extent
Destroy students' normal feeling for words
For example, students are asked to
Conform to fixed moral standards
For example, "Be grateful to parents", "Striving youth", etc.
These themes do not correspond to their true emotions
We say
The ability of an individual to understand his or her true feelings
It requires long-term training and cultivation
When writing is filled with lies and clichés for a long time
individual
I gradually lost the ability to accurately perceive words.
I also lost the ability to write about my true feelings.
The commonality between our lies and clichés is that
They are disconnected from reality
The underlying logic is confusing
thus
It is also unable to help people understand and summarize reality.
And clear, true, powerful language
Can strengthen a person's subjectivity
Make people aware
Under its various and fragmented appearances
Have a consistent self
When one realizes this self-identity
This in itself can bring him an unconditional
Stable self-esteem
Make him more powerful
To resist environmental or external interference
And the poor writing education
The greatest harm is
He asked students to write a lot of contradictory
Confusing words
Although individuals write
Sentences with "I" as the subject
But the content after the subject is something I don't agree with
Or no real emotion
This can undermine an individual's perception and trust in the language
thereby
The individual personality is in a fragmented state
His Inner Strength
Always shrouded in a hazy mist
There is an assumption hidden in this.
It is the emotional experience of people in their natural state.
Behavior and cognition
Often fragmented
For example, a person is strict at work.
Silent in the family
In front of a friend, I am lively again
These diverse and contradictory experiences
It will cause confusion and division in the individual's identity
To integrate these chaotic experiences
Only language and narrative can be relied upon
Narratives can provide a personal experience
Give some coherent meaning
So
Composition Education in China
How does it harm students' narrative ability?
This is first reflected in the stereotype of the composition topic.
for example
Primary school composition
Students are usually asked to write about "My Hometown"
"My spare time" "My parents"
“The person I care about most in class”
"Remember a little happy thing"
Questioner and teacher
Students are usually asked to write out their true feelings.
Don't copy
Don’t be cookie-cutter
But in fact
If students really write down their true thoughts
It is easy to be criticized as unhealthy
Because this education
At most, I can accept the most childish
The most innocent wish
For example, enjoy the beautiful natural scenery
But they cannot accept human animals.
Private, personalized wishes
For example, a boy feels
What is the happiest thing about me in school?
Just passing little notes to the girls you like
Copy each other's homework
But this obviously cannot be written
So he could only write about how rich his spare time at school was.
Boys like to play ball
Girls like skipping rope and kicking shuttlecock
Everyone's life is diverse
All very happy
For example, write about classmates you admire
You can't write about what you really admire about him.
The result is nothing to write
I can only write that he is an excellent member
For example, if you find someone else's wallet, you can turn it in.
Helping an elderly person cross the road
The last composition
It has become a faceless exhibition of touching stories of China
For example
Write about your mother
This topic obviously involves real parent-child relationships
If you want to write the truth
It means
Students need to engage in a deep self-disclosure
This requires a sense of security.
But the environment of Chinese composition
Obviously, this kind of safe acceptance cannot be provided
then
Students can only follow a very old-fashioned template
Come write
For example, "I get out of school
I always see my mother standing in the kitchen cooking
Mom is always busy
Mom is so great"
For example, writing about your own father
A common routine is
I felt that my father was always very strict at first.
I don't understand my dad
Later I found out that my father often worked overtime
All have white hair
I suddenly felt guilty
This narrative style
This is obviously the result of Chinese language education.
It must fit into the framework of a strict father and a kind mother.
The main characteristic of a mother is selfless devotion
Give without regrets
The father must be strict and restrained
Poor at speaking
But I always support my children in my heart.
The narrative style of strict father and kind mother
Most in line with Chinese ideology
The family ethics that are promoted
Patriarchy and filial piety
Mothers represent the soft side of the hierarchy
Make people grateful by silently sacrificing
The father represents the rigid side of the hierarchy.
Through majesty and arbitrariness
Teach children to obey
This highly stylized parental image
Of course, this is seriously inconsistent with reality.
However, students found
Write about your parents according to this template
Easier to get high scores
If you write about your parents' shortcomings truthfully,
Not only can you not get high scores
You may even be criticized by your teacher.
Or being laughed at by classmates
For example
Many essay topics require students to write about their hometown
This seems very strange
Because the vast majority of students
Living in my own city since childhood
Many people may have never moved.
No clear sense of hometown or native place
So we can only make up experiences or apply templates
I grew up in the city.
I have to write that my hometown is in the countryside.
To describe nature
Finally, you must express your homesickness
Homesickness
Chinese language education
A fairly common theme
It even became an internet meme
On Station B and Tik Tok
The meme "Homesickness"
Often used to express
A nonsensical, deconstructive and spoof meaning
For example, I can't solve math problems.
Just write "expressing homesickness"
This is because
Many Chinese students do Chinese reading comprehension
If asked
What thoughts and feelings does the article reflect?
And I didn't understand it at all
It directly expresses the author's homesickness.
There is a certain probability of guessing right
It's a general template
What about Chinese education?
Why is there so much emphasis on homesickness?
We will discuss this in detail later.
Dig a hole here first
besides
Chinese language composition
Still exists
A large number of specific characters representing a certain spirit
For example, when it comes to perseverance
I must think of Sima Qian who endured humiliation and wrote the Records of the Grand Historian.
When it comes to devoting oneself to one's work, one should be selfless.
I think of Zhuge Liang
When it comes to not being afraid of setbacks, we must mention
Edison failed a thousand times before he invented the light bulb
There are also Li Bai, Du Fu, Emperor Taizong of Tang Li Shimin, etc.
These characters
They all represent a certain spirit or temperament.
Their images are also highly stereotyped
Symbolized and moralized
In this March issue of
In the video about official documents within the system
Also mentioned
There are many books in China that teach official document writing.
I will share with you a set of common vocabulary for official documents.
For example, leadership
It means to be far-sighted and have a bird's-eye view.
Take charge personally and be pragmatic and enterprising
Talking about the masses
It must be to understand the people's sentiments and integrate into the masses.
Reflecting public opinion
Mention of weather
It's sunny and windy.
Although these clichés are annoying to hear
But the biggest benefit is safety
Official document writing is a very risky thing
If you are not careful, you may make a mistake.
And invite punishment from superiors
therefore
In order to maintain a high degree of political consistency with superiors
The safest approach
Just keep quoting the speeches of senior leaders.
or party documents
For safety reasons, officials at all levels below
They will also quote the words of the previous level.
Repeatedly speaking official rhetoric
This shows the firmness and clarity of one's political stance
The same is true for Chinese composition
Language Education in China
It plays an important role in political education
That is to instill in students the values ​​of patriotism, hard work,
The value of dedication
For this teaching goal
Students just need to remember the stereotyped conclusions.
Any more insight into the complexity of the characters
This will lead to challenges and doubts about these values.
This is Chinese language composition
A paradox that can never be solved
On the one hand, the question setter and the teacher repeatedly emphasized
Don't tell lies or clichés
Be genuine
But it also requires that your emotions must be
Healthy, positive energy
But this repeated emphasis on not writing clichés
It is also a cliché in itself
It is using clichés to oppose clichés
This is similar to
China’s system
Documents are issued every now and then.
To criticize the formalism and bureaucracy of mountains of documents and endless meetings
So the lower level department said
Carefully understand the spirit of superior leaders
Have more meetings
Write more official documents to criticize formalism
However
This criticism itself is a link in formalism.
We have mainly discussed the
Routine of writing materials
besides
Writing structure is also a disaster area for templates
for example
I saw an article with 19,000 likes.
The title is "He who knows the routine will win the world"
The author believes that to improve writing performance
In the short term, we should focus on exploring routines.
Rather than improving literacy
Because I can't wait
Then what's next
The author shares 4 universal argumentative sentence patterns
5 universal quotes from famous people
And 3 universal ending templates
Why are those famous quotes omnipotent?
Because there's no logic
Comprehensive but empty
The kind of nonsense that is always correct
Later I read another post by this blogger
He shared this routine
Break any topic into topics
The opposite of the theme, and the purpose of the theme
Represented by red, green and blue
Then you can substitute it into the formula like
For example, the essay topic is Innovation
Then the opposite of innovation is conservatism.
No innovation
Then
You can just type these words directly into
For example, this sentence says
“We must avoid indulging in non-innovation
And in the temporary mirror flower water moon
Embrace the spirit of innovation
With vigorous and enthusiastic vigor
The integrity of not forgetting the original intention
Keep the faith in change and move forward"
If the theme of the composition is cultural confidence
The synonym of cultural confidence is great power confidence
Patriotism, love for one's country
The opposite is cultural insecurity.
Worship foreigners and kowtow to them
The ultimate goal is Chinese civilization, Chinese culture, etc.
So this sentence can be rewritten as:
"We must not indulge in servility
And in the temporary mirror flower water moon
Embrace patriotism
With vigorous and enthusiastic vigor
The integrity of not forgetting the original intention
Move forward with a sense of patriotism"
This cliché, flowery and empty style
This can basically summarize most of the essays written by primary and secondary schools in China.
Features
Actually
This kind of template-based composition fosters
It's not so much about writing ability
It's computing power.
That is, quickly splicing and combining existing elements
The ability to meet specific scoring rules
Its discourse system
It is no longer compatible with everyday Chinese.
therefore
I personally think
This kind of writing can no longer be considered Chinese.
We should view it as a
Only popular in the education system
Serving a special function
Industry jargon or encrypted language
The connotations of all its concepts are encrypted
Like Martian
Only popular in a specific network subculture circle
The same is true for templated essays
Once you leave the specific context of the Chinese language exam
This language seems extremely stiff and unnatural.
That’s all for the topic of Chinese composition.
