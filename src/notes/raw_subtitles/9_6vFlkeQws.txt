From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Natalie


Kitroof.
 This
 is
 the
 Daily.


[Music]


Well,
 it's
 the
 story
 that
 rocked
 the


sports
 world.
 A
 multi-million
 dollar


betting
 scheme
 that
 led
 to
 more
 than
 30


arrests,
 including
 current
 and
 former


NBA
 players
 and
 coaches.


>> Today,
 we
 go
 inside
 the
 federal


investigation
 into
 illegal
 gambling
 that


has
 rocked
 the
 NBA.


>> You
 know,
 this
 is
 right
 out
 of
 a
 movie.


You're
 talking
 about
 mob
 stuff.
 You're


talking
 about
 cheating
 at
 poker
 games,


rigging
 poker
 games.


>> The
 alleged
 schemes
 involve
 the
 mafia,


high-profile
 players,
 and
 the


manipulation
 of
 professional
 basketball


games
 to
 rig
 and
 win
 bets.


>> I
 understand
 betting
 is
 legal,
 but
 I
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 too
 much
 to
 ask
 of
 a


player
 or
 a
 coach,
 do
 not
 engage
 in


this.


>> For
 me,
 it's
 all
 about
 trust.
 People


watch
 this
 game
 because
 they
 think
 it's


real
 and
 fair.


>> And
 I'm
 just
 ashamed
 that
 they
 put


themselves
 and
 put
 their
 family
 and
 put


the
 NBA
 in
 this
 position.
 But
 there's


old
 saying
 in
 the
 hood,
 all
 money
 ain't


good
 money.


>> I
 talked
 to
 my
 colleagues
 Jonah
 Bramitch


and
 Jenny
 Brentice
 about
 the
 shocking


facts
 of
 the
 cases
 and
 the
 growing


concern
 that
 the
 explosion
 of
 online


betting
 may
 be
 compromising
 the


integrity
 of
 the
 sport.


It's
 Monday,
 October
 27th.


Jonah,
 the
 NBA
 season
 started
 last
 week.


Tons
 of
 storylines
 there.
 Huge
 week
 for


the
 league.
 But
 the
 biggest
 story
 at


this
 moment
 for
 the
 NBA
 had
 nothing
 to


do
 with
 the
 games.
 It
 was
 this
 massive


announcement
 made
 by
 the
 FBI
 director,


Cash
 Patel,
 on
 Thursday.
 So,
 walk
 me


through
 exactly
 what
 he
 said.


>> Sure.
 So,
 6:30
 in
 the
 morning,
 we
 get


this
 email.
 There's
 going
 to
 be
 this
 big


announcement
 and
 no
 one
 really
 knows


what
 it
 is
 beforehand.
 We're
 getting


kind
 of
 bits
 and
 pieces
 of
 it,
 but
 then


people
 go
 into
 the
 room.


>> Good
 morning.


>> And
 Cash
 Patel
 is
 there
 and
 he
 starts


talking
 about
 these
 two
 enormously


consequential


schemes.
 Today
 we
 are
 here
 in
 New
 York


to
 announce
 a
 historic
 arrest
 across
 a


wide
 sweeping
 criminal
 enterprise
 that


envelops
 both
 the
 NBA
 and
 Lacass.


>> So
 the
 first
 case
 is
 the
 poker
 case
 and


that
 is
 about
 a
 very
 complicated
 mafia


involved
 scheme
 to
 rig
 poker
 games
 and


prominent
 NBA
 figures
 were
 used
 almost


as
 bait
 to
 attract
 the
 victims
 to
 these


games.


There
 is
 no
 room
 for
 any
 type
 of


criminal
 behavior,
 be
 it
 on
 the
 world's


largest
 stage
 or
 in
 the
 back
 rooms
 of


Tiny
 Pers
 where
 guard
 games
 are
 being


plugged.


>> And
 then
 the
 second
 one
 intrudes
 more


closely
 on
 the
 life
 of
 the
 league


because
 this
 is
 one
 player,
 various


other
 co-conspirators


making
 bets
 about
 what's
 going
 to
 happen


in
 games
 based
 on
 their
 relationships


inside
 the
 locker
 room


>> is
 mindboggling.
 It's
 not
 hundreds
 of


dollars.
 It's
 not
 thousands
 of
 dollars.


It's
 not
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 dollars.


>> And
 what
 is
 immediately
 clear
 and
 what


he's
 talking
 about
 is
 that
 the
 scope
 of


this
 is
 enormous.


>> We're
 talking
 about
 tens
 of
 millions
 of


dollars
 in
 fraud
 and
 theft
 and
 robbery.


>> And
 then
 it
 hits
 the
 league
 in
 a
 place


that
 the
 league
 really
 doesn't
 want
 to


be
 hit.


>> And
 look,
 let's
 not,
 you
 know,
 mince


words.
 This
 is
 the
 insider
 trading
 saga


for
 the
 NBA.


[Music]


>> Okay?
 Let's
 take
 these
 schemes
 one
 by


one
 and
 we'll
 start
 with
 the
 illegal


rigged
 poker
 games.
 How
 did
 this
 work?


Who
 was
 there?
 What
 happened?
 I
 want
 to


know
 everything.


>> So,
 what
 I'm
 about
 to
 describe,
 they


haven't
 been
 proven.
 And
 I'm
 largely


drawing
 on
 indictments
 from
 prosecutors.


So,
 defense
 lawyers
 have
 not
 yet
 had
 a


say.
 It's
 not
 clear
 what
 they'll
 argue.


And
 all
 these
 are
 just
 allegations
 for


the
 moment.


>> Mhm.
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 kind
 of
 remarkable


story
 in
 its
 own
 right
 because
 this
 is
 a


story
 about
 pretty
 high
 techch
 rigging


of
 illegal
 poker
 games.
 They
 were
 held


regularly
 at
 two
 locations
 in
 New
 York.


And
 what
 would
 happen
 is
 using
 two
 NBA


figures
 as
 bait,
 the
 many,
 many
 people


involved
 in
 this
 scheme
 would
 have


victims
 come
 to
 these
 games
 and
 they


would
 use
 these
 advanced
 shuffling


machines
 that
 could
 tell
 them
 which
 of


them
 had
 the
 best
 hand
 and
 coordinate


with
 that
 knowledge
 to
 win
 this
 game
 and


defraud
 victims
 of
 their
 money.


>> And
 who's
 running
 these
 poker
 games?


Like,
 who's
 everyone
 behind
 all
 this?
 So


the
 mafia
 is
 is
 largely
 behind
 all
 this.


There's
 four
 different
 mafia
 families.


There
 are
 Bananos,
 the
 Gambinos,
 the


Genovves,
 and
 the
 Luces
 that
 are


involved
 in
 poker
 games.
 And
 it
 does


bring
 up
 this
 kind
 of
 image
 of
 Tony


Soprano
 and
 and
 the
 games
 from
 that


show.
 But
 this
 is
 really
 still


happening.
 You
 know,
 the
 the
 mafia
 still


exists
 in
 New
 York.
 And
 one
 of
 the


things
 they
 do,
 one
 of
 the
 ways
 they


make
 money
 is
 by
 getting
 these


operations
 off
 the
 street,
 out
 of
 the


public
 eye,
 and
 at
 the
 poker
 table.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 So,
 you
 have
 this
 kind
 of


oldworld
 aspect
 of
 this
 where
 the
 mafia


is
 involved,
 but
 it
 sounds
 like
 it
 was


kind
 of
 high-tech.
 You
 mentioned
 these


advanced
 shuffling
 machines,
 like
 the


mechanism
 by
 which
 the
 cheating
 happens.


It
 was
 pretty
 technological.


>> Yeah.
 And
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 kind
 of


crazy
 technologies
 involved
 in
 this.


There
 all
 these
 kind
 of
 almost
 like


James
 Bond
 like
 gadgets
 mixed
 in
 with


this
 mafia
 movie
 that
 we're
 hearing


about.


They
 had
 decoy
 cell
 phones
 that
 could


detect
 which
 cards
 were
 on
 the
 table
 at


which
 time.
 They
 had
 playing
 cards
 that


had
 these
 kind
 of
 invisible
 ink
 markings


that
 you
 would
 had
 to
 wear
 special


contact
 lenses
 to
 see


>> what.


>> And
 the
 rigged
 shuffling
 machines
 you


mentioned,
 it's
 funny.
 They're
 not


rigged
 in
 the
 way
 that
 they
 shuffle.


What
 they
 can
 do
 is
 analyze
 as
 they're


dealing
 a
 hand,
 the
 strength
 of
 that


hand
 relative
 to
 every
 other
 hand


they've
 dealt.
 So
 the
 shuffling
 is
 above


board,
 but
 what
 happens
 is
 that
 the


machine
 sends
 a
 signal
 to
 an
 outside


person
 known
 as
 the
 operator.
 The


operator
 then
 sends
 that
 information


back
 into
 the
 room
 to
 the
 person
 they


called
 the
 quarterback
 or
 the
 driver.


And
 everyone
 on
 the
 cheating
 team
 knows,


okay,
 we're
 going
 to
 coordinate
 this


knowing
 who
 has
 the
 best
 hand
 here.


[Music]


>> Can
 I
 ask
 how
 much
 money
 were
 these


games
 raking
 in?
 I
 think
 I'm
 used
 to
 the


idea
 of
 like
 a
 $25
 poker
 night.
 So,
 just


lay
 out
 for
 me
 what
 amount
 is
 being


stolen
 in
 this
 kind
 of
 cheating.


>> Like
 a
 truly
 absurd
 amount.
 An
 amount


that
 really
 kind
 of
 makes
 us
 curious


about
 who
 exactly
 is
 playing
 at
 these


games.


>> So,
 for
 example,
 John
 Doe
 number
 one
 is


named
 in
 the
 indictment.
 That's
 the


first
 victim.
 John
 Doe
 number
 one
 loses


$1.8
 million
 in
 a
 single
 game.
 And
 so


overall,
 we're
 talking
 about
 millions


and
 millions
 of
 dollars
 at
 these
 games,


which
 are
 held
 regularly
 both
 in
 the
 New


York
 locations
 I
 mentioned,
 but
 also
 all


over
 the
 United
 States,
 the
 indictment


says.


>> And
 you
 said
 that
 the
 NBA
 players


involved,
 they
 were
 used
 as
 a
 draw
 for


the
 other
 marks
 that
 came,
 they
 made
 the


games
 cool.
 So
 the
 implication
 is
 that


they
 were
 getting
 a
 cut
 of
 the
 winnings.


Like,
 were
 they
 in
 business
 with
 the


mafia?


>> They're
 directly
 accused
 of
 getting
 a


cut
 of
 the
 winnings.
 So
 yes,
 exactly.


They
 are
 accused
 of
 doing
 business
 with


the
 mafia.
 One
 of
 whom
 is
 quite
 well


known
 to
 NBA
 fans.
 Chanty
 Bilips,
 NBA


champion,
 current
 head
 coach
 for
 the


Portland
 Trailblazers.


>> Yep.


>> And
 the
 collection
 of
 guys
 at
 this
 table


is
 really
 fascinating,
 right?
 Cuz
 it's


mafia
 members,
 and
 then
 it's
 these


almost
 sports
 betting
 nerds
 who
 love


poker.
 So,
 just
 imagine
 that
 game.


Imagine
 the
 personalities
 that
 half
 the


the
 side
 is
 cheating.
 It's
 just
 an


extraordinary
 scene
 to
 think
 about.


Okay,
 I
 want
 to
 turn
 to
 the
 other


indictment.
 Cash
 Patel
 called
 this
 one


insider
 trading
 for
 the
 NBA.
 Is
 that


accurate?
 What
 are
 we
 talking
 about


here?


>> So,
 this
 is
 a
 scheme
 where,
 according
 to


the
 indictment,
 a
 NBA
 player
 and


co-conspirators
 traded
 on
 information


known
 only
 to
 them,
 known
 only
 to
 people


who
 would
 be
 inside
 the
 locker
 room.
 And


they
 used
 it
 to
 gamble
 on
 games
 with
 an


advantage
 that
 no
 one
 else
 had.
 And


that's
 exactly
 how
 insider
 trading


works.
 You
 have
 information
 that
 is
 not


available
 to
 the
 public
 and
 you
 use
 that


information
 to
 your
 financial
 advantage.


So
 it's
 actually
 a
 perfect
 explanation


of
 what
 happened
 here.


>> Tell
 me
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 about
 how
 they


used
 it
 to
 their
 advantage.
 Like


specifically
 in
 this
 case,
 what
 were


they
 doing?
 How
 did
 they
 make
 money?


>> So
 there
 are
 a
 couple
 different
 ways


that
 they
 used
 the
 information
 that
 they


had
 access
 to.
 And
 the
 first
 example
 is


the
 most
 outrageous
 and
 I
 think
 maybe


the
 most
 troubling
 for
 the
 MBA.
 So,
 the


one
 active
 NBA
 player
 who
 is
 a
 defendant


here
 is
 a
 guy
 named
 Terry
 Rosier.
 Terry


Rosier,
 he's
 currently
 a
 guard
 in
 the


Miami
 Heat,
 but
 in
 2023,
 he
 was
 a
 player


for
 the
 Charlotte
 Hornets.
 And
 while


playing
 for
 the
 Hornets,
 told
 his


co-conspirators,


hey,
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 out
 of
 this
 game


early
 with
 an
 injury,
 and
 no
 one
 knows


that
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 that,
 including


officials
 on
 my
 own
 team.
 So,
 knowing


that
 Roier
 was
 going
 to
 go
 out
 of
 this


game
 early
 was
 an
 enormous
 advantage.


And
 it
 was
 an
 advantage
 because
 his


co-conspirators
 then
 bet
 that
 he
 would


score
 fewer
 points,
 that
 he
 would
 be


less
 productive
 in
 this
 game
 than
 he


usually
 was.
 And
 of
 course,
 they
 were


right
 because
 when
 he
 went
 out
 early,


there
 was
 no
 chance
 that
 he
 was
 going
 to


make
 up
 those
 averages.
 And
 they
 were


able
 to
 win
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of


dollars.


>> So
 what
 you're
 talking
 about,
 those
 bets


on
 how
 many
 points
 he's
 going
 to
 score


at
 a
 certain
 point
 in
 the
 game,
 those


are
 what's
 been
 referred
 to
 as
 prop


bets.
 Can
 you
 just
 break
 down
 what
 prop


bets
 are?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 think
 when
 people
 who
 do
 not


gamble
 on
 sports
 consider
 sports


betting,
 when
 they
 consider
 it
 at
 all,


they
 might
 think
 that
 the
 easiest
 way
 to


do
 it
 is
 you're
 going
 to
 bet
 on
 who
 wins


and
 who
 loses.
 But
 sports
 gambling
 has


gotten
 a
 lot
 more
 sophisticated.
 And
 you


can
 bet
 on
 all
 these
 different
 kinds
 of


elements
 of
 a
 game,
 including
 an


individual
 player's
 performance,
 an


individual
 player's
 performance
 in
 a


certain
 category,
 like
 points
 scored,


rebounds.
 The
 amount
 of
 betting


categories
 has
 become
 really
 vast.
 And


that's
 important
 here
 because
 it
 shows


you
 that
 just
 Terry
 Rosier,
 one
 person


on
 a
 team
 of
 at
 least
 11
 basketball


players
 can
 actively
 impact
 betting
 even


if
 he
 can't
 ultimately
 control
 the


outcome
 of
 a
 game.


>> And
 that's
 what's
 at
 issue
 here,
 not


just
 with
 Rosier,
 right?
 The
 idea
 is


that
 the
 information
 that
 was
 being


traded
 was
 used
 to
 manipulate
 bets
 on


individual
 events
 like
 this.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 exactly
 right.
 And
 I'll


give
 you
 another
 example.
 And
 this
 one


is
 eyebrow
 raising
 not
 because
 it


involves
 the
 kind
 of
 obvious
 flagrant


violation
 that
 Rosier
 is
 accused
 of,
 but


because
 of
 the
 name
 it
 does
 involve.
 So


the
 other
 NBA
 figure
 involved
 in
 this


scheme
 is
 a
 guy
 named
 Damon
 Jones.
 And


in
 February
 2023,
 he
 was
 an
 unofficial


assistant
 coach
 for
 the
 Los
 Angeles


Lakers.
 While
 he
 was
 in
 that
 role,
 he


got
 information
 that
 a
 prominent
 player,


according
 to
 the
 indictment
 named
 player


three,
 was
 not
 going
 to
 play
 in
 a
 game.


Jones
 then
 quickly
 spread
 that


information
 to
 his
 co-conspirators.
 They


just
 bet
 on
 the
 Lakers
 losing
 that
 game.


And
 the
 description
 of
 player
 three
 in


the
 indictment
 perfectly
 matches
 LeBron


James.
 Now,
 LeBron
 is
 not
 accused
 of
 any


wrongdoing.
 he's
 not
 even
 implicated.


But
 you
 can
 see
 why
 this
 is
 such
 a
 huge


problem
 for
 the
 NBA
 because
 even
 the


spectre
 of
 the
 possibility
 that
 a
 scheme


like
 this
 touched
 on
 their
 most


marketable
 star,
 the
 face
 of
 their
 sport


for
 more
 than
 a
 decade
 hints
 at
 the


issues
 when
 the
 integrity
 of
 an
 NBA
 game


begins
 to
 be
 called
 into
 question.


Jonah,
 you've
 covered
 really
 big
 cases


for
 us,
 including
 Trump
 trials,
 the


Leticia
 James
 arraignment.
 Where
 does


this
 rank
 for
 you
 in
 the
 pantheon
 of
 all


of
 the
 cases
 you've
 been
 looking
 at?
 How


earthshattering
 does
 it
 feel?


>> Yeah.
 In
 terms
 of
 the
 scale
 and


high-profile
 nature
 of
 what
 I
 often


cover,
 it
 doesn't
 quite
 touch
 those


things,
 but
 criminal
 cases
 always
 in


some
 way
 touch
 on
 what's
 going
 on
 in


society.
 Like
 that
 seems
 like
 a
 silly


thing
 to
 say,
 but
 it's
 actually
 what


makes
 it
 so
 interesting.


There's
 all
 this
 legality.
 There's
 all


these
 specifics
 of
 these
 indictments,


but
 it
 always
 touches
 back
 with


something
 that's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 broader


world.
 And
 I
 just
 see
 that
 this
 case,


like
 the
 other
 cases
 that
 I've
 covered,


really
 speaks
 to
 something
 that's
 going


on
 in
 the
 moment.
 In
 this
 case,
 exactly


what's
 going
 on
 in
 sports
 gambling
 and


why
 it
 poses
 such
 a
 problem
 for
 these


leagues
 in
 2025.


>> Well,
 Jonah,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Of
 course.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.


>> After
 the
 break,
 I'll
 talk
 to
 my


colleague
 Jenny
 Ventus
 about
 exactly


that.
 how
 the
 proliferation
 of
 sports


betting
 may
 contribute
 to
 scandals
 like


this
 and
 the
 impact
 that
 it's
 had
 on
 our


culture.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[Music]


Jenny,
 we
 are
 here
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 about


the
 sports
 betting
 indictment
 that
 just


seems
 like
 it
 has
 really
 huge


implications
 definitely
 for
 the
 NBA
 and


maybe
 for
 sports
 in
 general.
 And
 in
 many


ways,
 it
 does
 seem
 as
 though
 sports


betting
 has
 proliferated
 in
 recent


years,
 especially
 these
 prop
 bets
 that


are
 central
 to
 this
 indictment.
 And
 this


is
 a
 question
 that
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 have
 been
 asking.
 What
 effect


will
 it
 have
 on
 the
 integrity
 of
 the


game?
 You've
 been
 covering
 this
 world


for
 a
 very
 long
 time.
 So,
 let
 me
 just


ask
 you,
 do
 you
 think
 that
 the
 explosion


of
 online
 sports
 betting
 enabled
 the


criminal
 conspiracy
 that
 was
 just


revealed?
 I
 think
 it
 creates
 conditions


in
 which
 gambling
 is
 more
 normalized,


more
 part
 of
 society
 and
 there
 are
 more


chances
 for
 criminal
 activity.


Obviously,
 these
 crimes
 are
 still
 in
 the


stage
 where
 the
 people
 have
 been
 accused


and
 the
 crimes
 haven't
 been
 adjudicated.


But
 I
 do
 think
 what
 we're
 seeing
 now


with
 this
 situation
 is
 this
 is
 what


sports
 leagues
 didn't
 want
 to
 happen.


This
 is
 what
 fans
 didn't
 want
 to
 happen.


And
 now
 that
 it's
 happened,
 okay,
 it's


one
 case,
 but
 it
 involves
 a
 lot
 of


people.
 It
 involves
 multiple
 players,


coaches
 sharing
 information
 on
 multiple


teams,
 on
 multiple
 games.
 And
 so
 I
 do


think
 it's
 fair
 for
 fans
 and
 anyone
 who


loves
 sports
 in
 the
 United
 States
 to


wonder,
 is
 this
 just
 the
 tip
 of
 the


iceberg?
 Okay,
 I
 want
 to
 get
 to
 the


question
 that
 you
 raised
 about
 whether


this
 is
 possibly
 way
 more
 widespread


than
 we
 even
 know.
 But
 just
 to
 slow
 down


and
 pause
 for
 a
 moment,
 can
 we
 walk


through
 exactly
 what
 this
 embrace
 of


sports
 betting
 has
 looked
 like
 from
 the


perspective
 of
 the
 leagues,
 fans,
 and


the
 players
 themselves?


>> Absolutely.
 It
 wasn't
 that
 long
 ago
 that


sports
 leagues
 were
 opposed
 to
 the


legalization
 of
 sports
 betting
 in
 the


United
 States.
 However,
 in
 2018,
 the


Supreme
 Court
 overturned
 a
 law
 that


effectively
 banned
 sports
 betting
 in


most
 of
 the
 country.
 And
 as
 a


consequence,
 there
 were
 significant


business
 opportunities
 that
 came
 from


that
 that
 sports
 leagues
 wanted
 to
 take


advantage
 of.


So,
 they
 built
 partnerships
 with
 sports


books.


>> You
 want
 to
 make
 every
 game
 interesting,


step
 one,
 open
 the
 Bed
 MGM
 sports
 book.


Step
 two,
 put
 some
 skin
 in
 the
 game.
 And


step
 three,
 showtime.


>> There
 are
 licensing
 deals.


>> New
 arena.
 How
 about
 a
 new
 network?


Welcome
 to
 FanDuel
 Sports
 Network.
 Your


home
 for
 Clippers
 basketball.


>> There
 is
 signage
 all
 over
 stadiums.
 Some


stadiums
 have
 sports
 books
 inside
 of


them.


>> You
 can
 even
 bet
 on
 games
 while
 they're


still
 being
 played.


>> Seriously.


>> During
 TV
 broadcasts,
 there
 are
 prompts


to
 bet
 during
 the
 game.
 Now
 you're
 in


the
 ring
 with
 the
 king
 of
 sports
 books.


You
 know
 what
 to
 do.


>> How
 quickly
 this
 has
 changed
 in
 the
 last


7
 years
 is
 dizzying.
 I'm
 a
 person
 that


has
 followed
 sports,
 covered
 sports
 for


a
 long
 time,
 and
 even
 I
 am
 surprised
 by


how
 quickly
 betting
 has
 become
 embedded


into
 how
 we
 consume
 sports.


Yeah,
 I
 should
 probably
 at
 this
 point


come
 out
 as
 a
 huge
 sports
 fan
 myself.


I've
 also
 been
 shocked
 at
 just
 how
 much


all
 of
 this
 is
 plastered
 everywhere.
 How


unavoidable
 it
 is
 at
 halftime,
 at
 the


games,
 it's
 everywhere.
 I
 think
 one
 of


the
 things
 I
 didn't
 understand
 though


was
 these
 smaller
 prop
 bets
 and
 how


important
 they
 are
 to
 this
 new


infrastructure,
 to
 this
 new
 industry.


Yes,
 absolutely.
 The
 volume
 and
 types
 of


bets
 has
 exploded
 exponentially
 over
 the


last
 few
 years.
 And
 I
 think
 as
 a


consequence
 of
 that,
 you
 are
 presenting


more
 opportunities
 for
 individual


occurrences
 in
 the
 game
 to
 potentially


be
 manipulated
 because
 it's
 very
 hard
 to


fix
 a
 game.
 You
 need
 cooperation
 of
 the


entire
 team.
 You
 can't
 control


everything
 that
 happens
 in
 a
 game.
 But


what
 you
 can
 do
 is
 you
 can
 control
 in


some
 level
 your
 individual
 performance


or
 the
 outcome
 of
 a
 single
 period
 of


time
 or
 a
 single
 part
 of
 your
 game,


>> right?
 Like
 if
 you're
 a
 pitcher,


obviously
 you
 can
 control
 the
 kind
 of


pitch
 you
 throw.
 If
 you're
 a
 point


guard,
 you
 can
 decide
 who
 gets
 the
 ball


at
 any
 point.
 I'm
 wondering
 if
 you
 can


walk
 me
 through
 the
 engagement
 aspect
 of


this.
 Like
 what
 does
 it
 do
 to
 a
 fan


experience
 and
 to
 the
 overall
 watching


experience
 if
 people
 are
 betting
 on
 each


of
 these
 individual
 outcomes?


>> Right.
 Exactly.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 a


huge
 piece
 of
 this
 conversation
 because


this
 is
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 that
 leagues


have
 embraced
 sports
 betting
 because


they
 believe
 that
 if
 people
 are
 betting


on
 games
 and
 during
 games
 that
 they
 will


watch
 more
 games
 for
 longer
 periods
 of


time.
 And
 we've
 also
 seen
 this
 increase


in
 these
 bets
 that
 come
 during
 a
 game


sort
 of
 keep
 people
 watching
 and
 keep


people
 interested
 in
 a
 game
 maybe
 you


would
 have
 no
 interest
 in
 watching


otherwise.
 And
 that
 all
 feeds
 into
 fan


engagement.
 the
 more
 eyes
 that
 are
 on


games,
 then
 the
 price
 of
 the
 media


rights
 deals,
 which
 are
 the
 largest


source
 of
 profit
 for
 the
 NBA
 and
 the


NFL,
 that
 goes
 up.
 And
 so
 there
 you
 see


why
 there
 has
 been
 this
 push
 of
 more


betting
 opportunities
 throughout
 games.


>> Let's
 talk
 about
 the
 league's
 economic


interests
 here.
 What
 has
 embracing


sports
 betting
 done
 for
 their
 bottom


line?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 sports
 betting
 has
 been
 a


huge
 financial
 boon
 for
 sports
 leagues.


I
 mean,
 they
 have
 partnerships
 with


sports
 betting
 operators
 that
 net


something
 around
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 of


dollars
 a
 year.
 They
 have
 stakes
 in


these
 data
 companies
 that
 sell


statistics
 from
 sports
 games
 to
 sports


books,
 which
 are
 used
 to
 create
 some
 of


these
 prop
 bets,
 for
 instance.
 And
 so,


it's
 become
 this
 ecosystem
 where
 sports


betting
 is
 so
 embedded
 in
 the
 business


interests
 of
 the
 leagues
 that
 it
 would


be
 hard
 to
 back
 out
 at
 this
 point.


They're
 just
 totally
 inshed.


>> They're
 totally
 inshed.
 Absolutely.


>> To
 just
 return
 to
 the
 conspiracy
 that


has
 been
 laid
 out
 in
 this
 indictment.
 I


can
 see
 a
 world
 in
 which
 people
 might


look
 at
 what's
 happened
 and
 say,
 "Look,


actually,
 the
 rise
 of
 online
 sports


betting,
 it
 allows
 you
 to
 track
 more


easily
 unusual
 bets.
 And
 therefore,
 it's


not
 the
 rise
 of
 online
 sports
 betting


that
 enabled
 this.
 This
 is
 just


gambling.
 And
 actually,
 we're
 in
 a


position
 where
 we
 can
 catch
 this
 more


easily."
 But
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 it
 does


seem
 as
 though
 from
 what
 you're
 saying,


it's
 just
 becomes
 so
 much
 easier
 to
 bet


on
 every
 little
 tiny
 thing.
 Like
 it's


hard
 to
 imagine
 finding
 a
 bookie
 back
 in


the
 day
 who's
 willing
 to
 take
 a
 bet
 on


whether
 someone
 is
 going
 to
 hit
 a
 three


in
 the
 last
 two
 minutes
 of
 the
 third


quarter.
 And
 so
 there's
 a
 world
 in
 which


the
 proliferation
 itself


does
 pave
 the
 way
 for
 a
 scandal
 like


this.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's
 sort
 of
 a
 both


things
 are
 true
 situation
 here
 in
 that


it
 is
 true
 that
 sports
 books
 and
 sports


leagues
 work
 with
 integrity
 monitors


that
 are
 catching
 suspicious
 betting


activity
 and
 that
 those
 integrity


monitors
 played
 a
 role
 in
 spotting
 this


scandal.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 point
 that


you're
 making,
 which
 I
 think
 is
 a
 true


one,
 is
 that
 when
 you
 have
 this
 world
 in


which
 you
 can
 bet
 on
 so
 many
 things


through
 the
 course
 of
 a
 game,
 you
 have


to
 consider
 the
 fact
 that
 there
 are
 more


chances
 for
 manipulation
 and
 it
 makes
 it


harder
 to
 catch
 when
 there
 are
 so
 many


more
 opportunities.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 the


options
 for
 the
 MBA
 right
 now
 because


the
 incentives
 are
 kind
 of
 interesting.


On
 the
 one
 hand,
 you
 can
 see
 how
 they'd


be
 worried
 if
 people
 start
 to
 on
 mass


doubt
 that
 what
 they're
 seeing
 on
 the


court
 is
 real.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 as


you've
 said,
 this
 is
 just
 a
 huge


business
 for
 them.


>> I
 think
 the
 interesting
 thing
 is
 that


game
 integrity
 is
 actually
 something


that
 all
 of
 the
 stakeholders
 care
 about.


The
 sports
 books
 care
 about
 it,
 the


leagues
 care
 about
 it,
 the
 betters
 care


about
 it.
 If
 fans
 start
 to
 believe
 that


betting
 is
 an
 influence
 for
 players
 on


the
 court
 or
 coaches
 of
 teams
 to
 start


manipulating
 games,
 it
 really
 does


undercut
 the
 trust
 and
 the
 experience


that
 fans
 have
 when
 they
 watch.
 What
 I


do
 think
 is
 a
 potential
 landing
 spot


here
 is
 for
 sports
 leagues
 to
 come


together
 and
 say
 we
 are
 going
 to
 limit


or
 ban
 prop
 bets.
 However,
 on
 the


sportsbook
 side,
 prop
 bets
 are
 a
 big


part
 of
 their
 business.
 I
 mean,
 one


estimate
 that
 I
 received
 would
 be
 if
 you


limited
 prop
 bets,
 you
 would
 potentially


be
 reducing
 the
 amount
 that
 people
 bet


by
 around
 20%.
 That's
 significant
 for


sports
 books
 and
 their
 business.
 And
 so,


this
 could
 be
 an
 area
 where
 you
 see
 what


is
 now
 a
 shared
 business
 interest


colliding
 a
 little
 bit.


>> Okay.
 So,
 we've
 talked
 about
 the


implications
 for
 the
 league,
 for
 the


fans.
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 about
 the
 players


because
 watching
 this
 all
 unfold,
 it


made
 me
 think
 that,
 you
 know,
 they're
 at


risk
 from
 this
 too.
 It
 raises
 the


possibility
 that
 suddenly
 the
 players


will
 be
 under
 more
 suspicion,
 right,


that
 especially
 if
 they
 aren't
 doing


well,
 if
 they're
 injured
 or
 even
 if
 they


just
 miss
 a
 couple
 shots,
 that
 people


might
 think
 they're
 setting
 up
 a
 bet.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 really
 great


question
 and
 I'm
 glad
 you
 raised
 it.


We've
 seen
 that
 players,
 you
 know,


they'll
 get
 harassing
 messages
 from


angry
 berstors
 who
 a
 bet
 didn't
 go
 their


way.
 A
 lot
 of
 players
 have
 started
 to


speak
 out
 about
 this.
 I
 think
 there's


another
 element
 here,
 too,
 which
 is
 the


pressure
 from
 people
 around
 you
 to
 get


inside
 information
 from
 you.
 And
 what
 we


saw
 in
 the
 federal
 indictments
 is
 there


were
 several
 cases
 in
 which
 people
 in


somebody's
 entourage
 or
 a
 childhood


friend
 or
 a
 trainer
 was
 sharing


information
 about
 the
 players.
 And
 I


think
 where
 you
 could
 see
 the
 pressure


being
 the
 hardest
 to
 navigate
 is
 for


people
 who
 aren't
 paid
 millions
 of


dollars.
 You
 know,
 for
 college
 athletes


or
 people
 in
 lower
 tier
 pro
 leagues
 who


might
 be
 getting
 pressure
 from
 people


for
 inside
 information
 and
 maybe
 the


money
 feels
 worth
 it
 to
 them.
 So
 I
 do


think
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 consequences


for
 the
 players
 dealing
 with
 how
 much


sports
 gambling
 has
 become
 part
 of
 the


sports
 worlds
 that
 they're
 in.
 And
 I


think,
 you
 know,
 they
 haven't
 had
 any


input
 into
 that.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 the


world
 that
 they're
 playing
 in.
 Right.


>> Right.
 This
 has
 been
 totally
 forced
 on


them
 and
 they
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 the


consequences.
 It
 sounds
 like


>> Exactly.
 You
 mentioned
 this
 earlier
 and


I
 want
 to
 just
 come
 back
 to
 it.
 How


worried
 are
 fans,
 our
 experts,
 are
 you


that
 this
 could
 be
 more
 widespread
 than


just
 this
 one
 scandal?
 You
 know,
 that


this
 could
 be
 in
 many
 different
 sports.


There's
 a
 world
 in
 which
 it
 sort
 of


seems
 like
 you
 kind
 of
 have
 to
 be


worried
 about
 that,
 wondering
 whether


anything
 you're
 watching
 in
 any
 one
 of


these
 leagues
 could
 be
 manipulated
 at


any
 moment.
 I
 think
 it's
 fair
 for
 any
 of


us
 to
 ponder
 that.
 And
 I
 think
 once
 you


start
 to
 ponder
 that,
 then
 the
 cracks


begin.


Even
 in
 just
 this
 federal
 indictment,


right,
 there
 were
 multiple
 teams,


multiple
 games,
 multiple
 years,
 players,


coaches,
 there
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 parts
 of


the
 NBA
 affected
 by
 this.
 And
 I
 think


it's
 come
 up
 enough
 times
 that
 it
 is
 a


persistent
 concern
 that
 the
 leagues
 are


going
 to
 have
 to
 confront
 and
 American


sports
 fans
 are
 going
 to
 have
 to
 reckon


with
 more
 and
 more.


[Music]


Well,
 Jenny,
 thanks
 so
 much.
 Thank
 you


for
 having
 me.


[Music]


Since
 the
 indictments
 were
 announced,


the
 House
 Committee
 on
 Energy
 and


Commerce
 has
 requested
 a
 briefing
 on
 the


scandal
 from
 NBA
 Commissioner
 Adam


Silver
 by
 this
 Friday,
 October
 31st.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 should
 know.
 Today,


on
 Sunday,
 Chinese
 and
 American


officials
 said
 they'd
 agreed
 to
 a


framework
 of
 a
 trade
 deal
 ahead
 of
 a


meeting
 planned
 between
 President
 Trump


and
 China's
 top
 leader
 Xiinping
 later


this
 week.
 Trade
 negotiators
 for
 the
 two


sides
 met
 in
 Malaysia
 and
 officials
 said


they
 discussed
 a
 range
 of
 issues


including
 Chinese
 restrictions
 on
 rare


earth
 minerals,
 port
 fees
 that
 the
 US


recently
 slapped
 on
 Chinese
 ships,
 and


an
 extension
 of
 a
 truce
 on
 tariffs.
 The


details
 of
 the
 framework
 remain
 unclear,


but
 Treasury
 Secretary
 Scott
 Bessant


said
 on
 ABC
 that
 he
 expected
 China
 to


delay
 global
 export
 controls
 on
 rare


earths
 and
 that
 the
 US
 threat
 of


imposing
 100%
 tariffs
 on
 China
 would
 be


averted.


And
 the
 French
 police
 made
 arrests
 in


the
 brazen
 jewelry
 heist
 last
 week
 at


the
 Louv.
 Though
 the
 authorities
 didn't


say
 how
 many
 people
 were
 taken
 into


custody,
 the
 Paris
 prosecutors
 said
 in
 a


statement
 that
 one
 man
 was
 taken
 into


custody
 at
 Charles
 de
 Gaulle
 airport
 in


Paris
 as
 he
 was
 trying
 to
 leave
 the


country.
 It
 was
 not
 immediately
 clear


whether
 the
 police
 had
 recovered
 any
 of


the
 stolen
 jewelry
 which
 includes


gemstudded
 royal
 tiaras,
 necklaces,
 and


earrings
 dating
 back
 to
 the
 19th


century.
