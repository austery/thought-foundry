And right now we are 2 minutes away from
the end of the trading day.
Romaine Bostick alongside Katie
Greifeld, taking you through to that
closing bell with a global simulcast.
It starts now.
Tim Stanley Back in the radio booth,
Emily Rafale by his side and for Carol
Massar today.
Welcome to our audiences across all of
our Bloomberg platforms, television and
radio, our partnership with YouTube on a
day where the market that rally got
upended in a big way, a new, fresh
social media post term center backed by
the President of the United States,
implying that more tariffs on China
could be coming.
That's what did it.
That was the crucial moment of the day
that changed the trade.
And for much of the day, we did see kind
of the S&P 500, its worst levels going
back to April 21st.
Then things fell on the S&P 500 to,
what, more than 2.4%?
Some selling into the closed down, 2.7%
right now.
Now it's the most going back to April
10th.
We're talking like Liberation Day kind
of thing.
That's what I was going to say.
Those selling into the close, We just
have one minute left and we're really
seeing the tech stocks getting hit the
hardest.
Look at the Nasdaq 100 right now, now
down about 3.5% with that late date
selling.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing to see sort of
the ripples across.
Asset classes remain.
And I've been talking about that.
Of course, it's not just equities and
bonds, it's also soybeans, copper.
We can really far and wide implications
here.
Yeah, you saw a bit of a spike in the
VIX up around that 22 level.
At one point in the session here, you're
seeing a big bid go into certain havens.
You talk about the record run in gold.
Take a look at the record run and silver
and look at the big bid that we're
seeing today into the yen and into the
Swiss franc as we get the closing bell
here in New York, I guess they're
required to clap and they're required to
cheer, but not a whole lot to actually
cheer about.
The S&P 500 looks like it's going to
close the day down by about 180 points
or about 2.7%.
That's going to be the worst day for the
S&P since April 10th.
The NASDAQ 100 and Nasdaq composite each
down more than 3% on the day.
That looks like that's going to be the
worst day for those names since April
10th.
The Russell 2000 down more than 74
points or 3% on the day.
That is going to be the worst day since
April 10th.
Yeah.
Taking a look at in the S&P 500, a
deeper dive in there, pulling back the
layers.
Things don't look so good if you're
long.
This market 1425 stocks to the downside.
Only 78 stocks in the green today.
Katie.
All right, let's take a look at the
circle, at the sectors, what the
performance there looks like.
It's not good.
You only have one spot of green there
and that is consumer staples.
Up about a third of a percent just tells
you what a defensive trade this is
today.
You think about what the big loser here
is and it's tech down about 4% as a
sector.
Those chip names in particular hit hard,
but really right across the board, Tim.
Well, it was tough to find stocks that
moved higher today, but that was the
task I was given.
And I think I found four of them, eight
and a half percent to the upside for AMP
materials and USAA, rare earths also up
5% today.
U.S.
listed rare earth and critical minerals
stocks rose today.
They extended gains after China unveiled
new export curbs and the U.S.
government got more involved in the
industry.
Joe Joe Gott was on our program and he
made the point that the export controls
were announced a couple of nights ago
from China, but really gained a lot of
attention in today's trade, partly due
and a big part of that had to do with
the president's comments a little
earlier and the increase in negotiating
power that we're seeing when it comes to
certain things.
Right on the US side, it's high tech and
chips and on the Chinese side it is
these rare earths.
Once again MP materials in USA, rare
earths up today in the trade.
Also protagonist Therapeutics shares
soaring on the day today this rising to
an intraday record after the Wall Street
Journal reported that Johnson and
Johnson is in talks to buy the biopharma
firm.
It's a clinical stage.
BioPharma firm shares higher to the
upside of close to 30%.
The company already has a partnership
with JNJ to develop therapies for immune
conditions, including an experimental
treatment for plaque psoriasis and
finally applied digital shares higher
today.
This is the digital infrastructure and
cloud services provider based in Texas.
The company did report earnings after
the bell yesterday.
First quarter revenue was well ahead of
estimates due to one time income from
tenant fit out services.
But the reason shares are higher is
because the firm said it's now in
advanced talks with a hyperscale or
client for its second data center campus
in North Dakota.
Shares today higher by more than 16%.
Katie.
And I want to take a quick sidebar here
and go to France, because we do have
some breaking news out of the French
government, and that is Macron has
renamed Sebastian Lecornu as France's
new prime minister.
Definitely a shock here.
We know, of course, that he lasted about
27 days, I believe was the number in
this slot.
But again, here is the headline, Macron
renaming Sebastien Lecornu as France's
new prime minister.
All right, Kati, getting back to
markets, it was a broad based sell off,
so it wasn't hard to find decliners
today.
But I did try and find a couple
companies that seemed to sell off
related to some fundamental news in
addition to just the broader macro sell
off.
Levi Strauss falling 12% today was the
worst intraday drop since April.
After the jeans maker's upgraded
earnings guidance fell short of high
investor expectations.
So the stock had rallied 42% heading
into the print, some of that optimism
was not met.
One key disappointment, according to
analysts, is that earnings growth for
Levi's is failing to match the pace of
sales expansion, and it's due to tariff
and distribution costs.
I'm also looking at venture global
falling 25% down the most since March.
This is a liquefied natural gas company
lost a dispute with BP today and
involved the sale of LNG cargoes from a
Louisiana facility on the spot market
rather than to customers with long term
contracts.
Analysts were surprised by the result of
this dispute and the BP win and view it
as a negative with a potential impact of
over $1 billion for venture global.
So that stock again down over 25 or a
little bit less than 25% decline for the
day.
Finally, we'll go back to tech, that
broad sell off.
I'm looking specifically at the Vaneck
Semiconductor ETF, the Tickers S and H,
the top holdings, Nvidia, TSMC,
Broadcom.
Listen, it's still up 34% year to date,
but it was getting hit pretty hard
today, falling almost 6% to close out
the day.
All right.
Let's take a quick look at treasuries.
We did actually see a bid come back into
that after we had seen earlier in the
week the exact opposite.
That pushed yields down across the
curve.
Most of the activity was kind of in the
middle.
They are five, ten and 20 year down
about eight basis points.
These also see similar move on the 30
year year to year yield down about seven
basis points.
And of course, Tim, this all seems to
link back to concerns about the US
government shutdown.
But then of course, that accelerated
buying that we saw in that space after
the social media posts by the president.
Remember, President Trump had just been
touting it just over the last couple of
weeks, how he was looking forward to
meeting with Xi maybe sometime towards
the end of this month or and beginning
of November, at least according to
Trump.
I don't know.
He didn't see a reason to.
But it raises the question remain about
whether or not this is just the way that
the president negotiates.
I mean, isn't isn't this what he does?
He does this in public.
He comes out with these statements.
Sometimes they move markets, sometimes
they don't.
And then maybe he does end up meeting
with whoever he's supposed to meet with
or he does end up getting what he wants.
That's what we've seen play out over the
last nine months.
And in terms of what this all means for
the equity market, we were just talking
with Bloomberg News's Alex Semien over.
She pointed out that a lot of these dips
this year, even when it's related to
geopolitical concerns, to tariff
concerns, the dips have been bought.
And so we really haven't seen a large
scale drawdown.
Think about what happened after
Liberation Day.
There was a massive rally.
If you were short the market, you really
got hurt.
So now it's kind of a wait and see what
happens.
Is this downturn more significant or do
we just see stocks rise on Monday?
I don't think I will ever forget what
happened after Liberation Day.
Those were some amazing intraday charts.
But, you know, it does raise the
question whether or not the fact that it
is a Friday has something to do with why
we aren't seeing this dip get
immediately bought.
There could be a hesitation out there to
hold risk into the weekend.
We know that, you know, social media
never sleeps, so we could get more
headlines then.
But we were talking about this a little
bit earlier.
I've seen some folks raise the notion
that maybe we'll see a revival of the
taco trade.
That is, of course, the idea that Trump
always chickens out.
It's a little bit rude, but it gets to
the idea that this could just be part of
the negotiation.
Well, there's a bigger issue, too, here,
which is also the idea that this is also
happening against the backdrop of a ten
day government shutdown that's deprived
us of the economic data that the market
was sort of looking to to try to divine
what comes next with the Fed.
We did get an update from the blast
saying that they are recalling some
people so they maybe potentially get
that data out by the end of the month.
The CPI data that was supposed to come
next week, they're now saying that that
could actually be cobbled together also
before the end of the month.
But again, I mean, we're kind of just
putting this together here willy nilly.
And that means that if you are a bull,
what conviction do you have the buy into
this without any earnings, without any
economic data and without any semblance
of peace in the tariff trade?
Well, you're not going have to wait long
to get earnings information.
We hear from some of the big banks next
week.
We got Goldman, Citigroup, Bank of
America.
They're among the banks that are
reporting next week.
And I think people are going to look
really closely at commentary that we
hear from Bank of America and Brian
Moynihan about the quality of spending
when it comes to consumers, about the
extent that consumers are using their
debit cards, how much cash they have,
how much can I give you my contrarian
take on this?
I actually think it's going to be less
important.
Why?
Because we already know they're doing
well.
And I feel like the banks and forgive me
if any of the big banks are watching,
but you're not really representative
right now of the economy writ large or
representative of a very sort of narrow
slice of the financial economy.
But what about Bank of America that that
banks you know, banks so many people
now, I mean, normal people will get
insights, but I don't but I would rather
wait to hear from the other companies
that are selling directly to the
consumer.
And more importantly, what about the air
trade and the CapEx spend there, because
that has been the driver of GDP.
That's what I want to hear.
That's my concern just just now.
It's somehow going to be the most
important week of bank earnings we've
ever seen.
I look forward to and I'll be gone.
I will be gone as well.
Yeah.
Are we going on vacation?
We're going to be here.
Are you guys.
I'm going on a bike ride.
On a bike ride with Tim at the Tandem.
I can't wait.
I'm going to be in the back and let him
do all the pedal.
