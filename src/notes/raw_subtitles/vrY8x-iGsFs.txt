I
 learned
 the
 world
 through
 internet.
 I


think
 for
 my
 daughter,
 they
 will
 learn


the
 world
 through
 AI.
 A
 company
 called


Scale
 AI,
 which
 is
 known
 for
 being
 a


data
 referring
 company.
 They've
 got
 so


much
 data
 from
 across
 the
 globe.


>> People
 sorting,
 labeling,
 and
 sifting


reams
 of
 data
 to
 train
 and
 improve
 AI


for
 companies
 like
 Meta,
 Open
 AI,


Microsoft,
 and
 Google.


>> Meta
 is
 paying
 nearly
 $15
 billion
 for
 a


scale
 AI
 stake.
 I've
 confirmed
 with
 a


source.


>> This
 just
 shows
 you
 how
 much
 there
 is
 a


need
 for
 data.
 We
 all
 contribute
 data
 to


AI.
 Your
 tweet,
 the
 posts
 that
 you
 do
 on


Facebook,
 the
 videos
 that
 we
 upload
 on


YouTube
 are
 the
 ones
 AI
 models
 are


trained
 on.
 But
 us
 as
 users,
 we
 don't


get
 paid
 for
 it.
 The
 data
 economy
 today


is
 valued
 about
 $1
 trillion.
 This
 is
 the


data.
 It's
 across
 the
 globe
 from


enterprises,
 organizations,
 and


individual
 people
 on
 the
 internet.
 And


let's
 assume
 about
 5%age
 of
 that
 is


contributed
 by
 individuals.
 That's
 close


to
 about
 $500
 billion.
 $500
 billion


worth
 of
 data
 that's
 taken
 away
 from
 you


and
 you're
 not
 getting
 paid
 for
 it.
 We


want
 to
 change
 that.
 What
 if
 we
 can
 flip


the
 switch
 here
 and
 have
 people
 have
 the


ownership
 to
 that?
 We
 want
 to
 build
 a


system
 where
 you
 can
 contribute
 your


data
 and
 you
 get
 paid
 for
 that.
 It's
 not


just
 for
 AI
 researchers
 or
 developers,


right?
 The
 common
 man
 who
 owns
 a
 lot
 of


data.
 We
 have
 close
 to
 about
 a
 million


users
 who
 are
 contributing
 data
 sets
 for


that.
 It's
 like
 how
 nations
 went
 ahead


and
 fought
 for
 oil.
 Now
 larger


organizations
 are
 going
 to
 fight
 for


data,
 right?
 Data
 is
 the
 new
 oil
 and


people
 have
 to
 realize
 that
 that
 they


own
 that
 oil.
 They
 own
 that
 data.
 But


it's
 time
 to
 fight
 back
 and
 earn
 a
 piece


of
 that.


I'm
 Ram.
 I'm
 one
 of
 the
 core


contributors
 at
 Open
 Ledger.
 Open
 Ledger


is
 an
 AI
 blockchain
 where
 people
 have


the
 data
 sets.
 AI
 systems
 need
 these


data
 sets.
 So
 as
 an
 application,
 you
 can


use
 Open
 Ledger
 to
 go
 ahead
 and


contribute
 a
 data
 set
 that
 you
 own.
 We


have
 lot
 of
 data
 contributors
 that


initially
 came
 on
 board.
 We
 have
 close


to
 about
 10
 ecosystem
 projects
 building


AI
 models
 on
 us.
 We
 have
 close
 to
 about


a
 million
 users
 who
 are
 contributing


data
 sets
 for
 that.


I've
 been
 in
 this
 industry
 close
 to
 a


decade
 right
 now.
 The
 idea
 was
 to
 build


an
 R&D
 company
 around
 blockchain
 and


machine
 learning.
 We
 saw
 there
 is
 a
 need


for
 enterprises
 to
 bring
 in
 fairness
 and


like
 transparency
 within
 their
 ecosystem


like
 within
 their
 organization.
 We
 had


an
 opportunity
 to
 work
 with
 enterprises


like
 Walmart,
 Sony,
 GSK
 and
 many
 more.


And
 what
 we
 realized
 is
 that
 especially


a
 technology
 like
 blockchain
 brings


equality
 among
 every
 user
 that
 uses


that.
 Open
 ledger
 is
 a
 contribution
 from


that.
 Idea
 was
 to
 not
 just
 service


enterprises
 uh
 build
 a
 product
 that
 can


be
 used
 by
 anyone
 across
 the
 globe
 and


figure
 out
 how
 AI
 is
 impacting
 everyone


lives.
 We
 all
 have
 this
 epiphany
 at
 one


point
 of
 time
 where
 you
 have


conversations
 with
 your
 friend
 about
 a


product
 that
 you
 want
 to
 buy
 and
 you
 see


that
 ad
 on
 Instagram
 you
 know
 that
 your


data
 is
 being
 used.
 I've
 had
 multiple


epiphanies
 as
 that
 and
 we've
 worked
 with


firms
 where
 we
 that
 is
 visible
 right


people's
 information
 was
 used
 to
 make


their
 product
 better
 sure
 it
 gave


convenience
 right
 but
 it
 also
 took


privacy
 that's
 going
 to
 happen
 with
 AI


as
 well
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 make
 money
 all


these
 large
 organizations
 going
 to
 make


money
 out
 of
 it
 but
 you're
 not
 going
 to


be
 part
 of
 that
 as
 we
 evolve
 right
 as


models
 evolve
 models
 will
 become


specialized
 where
 they
 need
 data
 sets


from
 people
 and
 in
 that
 case
 we
 need
 to


make
 sure
 that
 we
 can
 own
 our
 data
 and


we
 get
 paid
 for
 it
 and
 that's
 what
 open


is
 trying
 to
 solve
 It's
 a
 platform
 where


users
 can
 come
 and
 contribute
 data
 sets


which
 could
 be
 let's
 say
 a
 knowledge


that
 they
 have
 about
 trading
 or
 a


knowledge
 about
 a
 particular
 subject.


Let's
 say
 I
 know
 to
 cook
 well
 I
 can
 go


ahead
 and
 contribute
 that
 and
 then


models
 can
 use
 this
 data
 and
 if
 they
 use


that
 data
 and
 they
 build
 an
 AI
 out
 of


that
 and
 this
 AI
 makes
 revenue
 or


creates
 an
 impact
 you
 should
 be
 a
 part


of
 that
 you
 should
 get
 a
 piece
 of
 that


revenue.
 We
 want
 to
 bring
 in
 famas
 to


this
 ecosystem.
 The
 people
 who


contribute
 data
 or
 a
 model
 developer
 or


a
 comput
 provider
 or
 any
 kind
 of


resource
 provider
 gets
 paid
 as
 part
 of


the
 process
 and
 that's
 what
 opener
 is


all
 about.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 say
 that
 AI


is
 going
 to
 make
 people
 lose
 jobs.
 I


don't
 think
 so.
 It
 might
 be
 a
 temporary


thing
 but
 it's
 going
 to
 create
 a
 lot
 of


jobs.
 Data
 contribution
 itself
 could
 be


a
 great
 gig
 economy.
 Data
 is
 also
 very


relevant
 with
 enterprises.
 Data
 you
 find


on
 internet
 is
 very
 generalized
 but
 the


data
 that
 you
 would
 find
 in
 a
 firm
 in
 an


enterprise
 is
 very
 specialized
 right
 and


all
 of
 his
 knowledge
 did
 not
 come
 on
 the


internet
 right
 people
 don't
 write
 blogs


about
 it
 a
 surgeon
 doesn't
 write
 about


how
 what
 his
 experience
 in
 actually


doing
 the
 surgery
 an
 artist
 doesn't


write
 about
 how
 he
 actually
 painted
 a


picture
 so
 it's
 all
 comes
 down
 to
 the


individual
 person's
 knowledge
 that
 they


own
 this
 knowledge
 would
 be
 needed
 for


AI
 right
 for
 AI
 to
 truly
 get
 into
 all


parts
 of
 our
 lives
 more
 than
 just
 a


chatbot
 it
 needs
 to
 no
 knowledge
 about


the
 entire
 world.
 It
 needs
 to
 know
 about


very
 intricate
 details.
 Right?
 In
 that


case,
 people
 would
 reach
 out
 to
 you
 know


individual
 users
 to
 get
 their
 knowledge.


So
 we
 knew
 that
 chart
 GPD
 moment
 will


not
 going
 to
 be
 there
 as
 just
 a
 spark.


It's
 going
 to
 become
 much
 more
 bigger.


We're
 going
 to
 build
 AI
 systems
 that
 are


very
 specialized
 in
 various
 use
 cases.


But
 there
 is
 not
 enough
 data
 out
 there


on
 the
 internet.
 We've
 seen
 lot
 of


independent
 developers
 who
 have
 lot
 of


innovative
 ideas
 who
 are
 actually


building
 interesting
 AI
 models
 in
 the


Asian
 region.
 They
 contribute
 data
 sets


by
 using
 our
 nodes
 which
 is
 basically
 a


node
 they
 can
 download
 and
 have
 it
 as
 a


plug-in.
 They
 can
 contribute
 data
 sets


for
 that.
 If
 you
 take
 a
 look
 at
 uh
 web


3's
 nature
 internet
 was
 supposed
 to
 be


decentralized
 but
 because
 of
 convenience


we
 let
 larger
 organizations
 take
 that.


So
 making
 sure
 that
 it
 does
 not
 go
 back


to
 bunch
 of
 centralized
 larger
 firms
 is


very
 important.
 We
 don't
 have
 money
 to


fight
 for
 it.
 All
 we
 have
 is
 our
 own


power
 people
 coming
 together
 and


building
 something
 against
 the
 larger


organizations.
 In
 order
 for
 that
 to


happen,
 you
 need
 to
 make
 people
 to
 come


together
 and
 community
 building
 is
 very


important
 as
 part
 of
 that.
 Building
 a


very
 strong
 culture,
 building
 a
 very


strong
 community.
 Having
 the
 same
 goal,


building
 systems
 that
 are
 open,


verifiable,
 and
 rewarding
 is
 what
 makes


people
 come
 together.
 Let's
 take
 an


example
 of
 Ethereum
 itself.
 Ethereum
 is


a
 very
 communitydriven
 blockchain
 and


that
 is
 why
 it's
 so
 strong
 today.
 Even


though
 it
 has
 its
 ups
 and
 down,
 uh


Ethereum
 as
 an
 ecosystem
 is
 very
 strong.


That's
 why
 I
 think
 community
 is
 very


important
 in
 what
 we're
 building.
 So
 to


explain
 uh
 proof
 of
 attribution
 in
 a


very
 simple
 manner,
 what
 if
 there's
 a


tracking
 mechanism
 where
 you
 can
 see
 and


who
 actually
 contributed
 for
 all
 of
 this


and
 you
 can
 also
 see
 it
 on
 chain
 that


everyone
 who
 contributed
 are
 getting


paid
 for
 it.
 So
 it's
 a
 tamper-proof


record
 of
 your
 data's
 ownership.
 It's
 a


record
 of
 how
 your
 data
 was
 used
 and


it's
 also
 a
 record
 of
 how
 much
 you're


going
 to
 get
 paid
 if
 your
 data
 was
 used


as
 well.
 So
 the
 reason
 why
 we
 have
 the


proof
 of
 attribution
 is
 because
 we
 need


to
 have
 a
 trustless
 system
 where
 they


don't
 have
 to
 believe
 RAM
 right
 they
 can


believe
 the
 system
 they
 can
 believe
 the


code
 I
 think
 that's
 very
 important
 as
 a


data
 contributor
 you
 can
 go
 ahead
 and


choose
 the
 model
 that
 needs
 the
 data
 and


you
 can
 start
 contributing
 data
 sets
 to


that
 it's
 that
 cyclic
 uh
 ecosystem
 you


want
 to
 build
 all
 the
 data
 that
 is


contributed
 is
 record
 on
 the
 blockchain


because
 so
 that
 we
 can
 track
 this
 and
 we


can
 pay
 this
 as
 a
 user
 I
 know
 that
 I
 can


prove
 my
 ownership
 by
 having
 it
 on
 chain


Another
 interesting
 side
 that
 we
 have


started
 to
 see
 a
 smaller
 model


developers
 and
 innovative
 you
 know


people
 who
 want
 to
 build
 something


interesting
 have
 started
 using
 our


product.
 A
 good
 example
 that's
 being


built
 on
 open
 edger
 is
 a
 bunch
 of


doctors
 are
 building
 uh
 a
 sleep
 model.


The
 model
 is
 trained
 on
 sleep
 data
 sets


high
 quality
 sleep
 data
 sets
 across
 the


globe.
 Uh
 they
 want
 to
 get
 access
 to
 the


sleep
 data
 sets
 from
 various
 parts
 of


the
 world
 so
 they
 can
 cover
 various


races.
 This
 particular
 data
 set
 is
 very


unique
 because
 they're
 going
 to


correlate
 that
 with
 their
 health
 vitals


and
 then
 once
 the
 model
 is
 ready
 you
 can


just
 upload
 your
 sleep
 data
 and
 then


it's
 just
 going
 to
 tell
 you
 what's
 your


body
 vital
 looks
 like.
 So
 like
 this
 we


have
 very
 interesting
 players
 who
 are


building
 models
 on
 us
 very
 niche


innovative
 ideas
 where
 you
 need
 data


which
 is
 quite
 unique.
 We
 are
 quite


excited
 about
 them.
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 people


ask
 me
 like
 why
 this
 has
 to
 use


blockchain
 it
 could
 be
 a
 traditional
 AI


company
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 If
 you


take
 a
 look
 at
 generalized
 models,
 the


era
 of
 that
 will
 slowly
 fade
 away.


Agents
 will
 become
 much
 more


specialized.
 There'll
 be
 an
 agent
 for


healthare.
 There'll
 be
 an
 agent
 for


legal.
 There'll
 be
 agents
 for
 every


other
 sector
 out
 there.
 And
 you
 can
 have


a
 general
 model
 power
 that
 you
 need
 to


have
 a
 specialized
 model
 that
 powers
 it.


And
 the
 data
 set
 is
 among
 actually


people.
 And
 these
 data
 sets
 can


eventually
 become
 models,
 specialized
 AI


models
 which
 then
 can
 be
 consumed
 by


apps
 and
 agents
 that
 are
 going
 to
 be


built
 on
 top
 of
 that.
 So
 I
 think
 every


aspect
 of
 our
 life
 will
 change.
 How
 we


take
 a
 ride
 home,
 our
 doctor
 visits
 and


what
 we
 learn
 from
 all
 of
 that
 will


change.
 I
 learned
 the
 world
 through


internet.
 I
 think
 for
 my
 daughter
 AI


will
 create
 a
 huge
 impact,
 right?
 They


will
 learn
 the
 world
 through
 AI.
 So
 that


AI
 has
 to
 be
 responsible.
 So
 building
 a


responsible
 AI
 system
 is
 upon
 us.
 If
 we


encourage
 larger
 ecosystems
 to
 go
 ahead


and
 consume
 our
 data
 and
 not
 reward
 us,


then
 that's
 what
 is
 going
 to
 happen.


Right?
 I
 think
 now
 it's
 time
 to
 change


it.
 If
 we
 can
 realize
 how
 important
 our


data
 is,
 probably
 that's
 the
 best
 output


that
 we
 can
 see
 out
 of
 AI.
