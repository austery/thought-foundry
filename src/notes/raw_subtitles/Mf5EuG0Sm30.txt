Hi
 everyone.
 Today
 we
 are
 exploring
 the


building
 blocks
 of
 one
 of
 the
 world's


most
 beloved
 brands,
 LEGO.
 And
 I'm
 here


with
 Nils
 Christianen
 who's
 led
 LEGO


since
 2017.
 And
 we
 are
 going
 to
 learn


about
 their
 remarkable
 business
 model


and
 what
 makes
 this
 company
 so
 special.


So
 warm
 welcome
 Nilson.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 So,
 I
 was
 on
 um
 I


was
 on
 the
 train
 last
 weekend
 uh
 down


from
 the
 Norwegian
 mountains
 and
 I


happened
 to
 sit
 next
 to
 this
 lady


>> and
 um
 I
 was
 preparing
 for
 this
 uh
 for


this
 podcast
 and
 I
 asked
 her,
 "Hey,
 what


would
 you
 what
 would
 you
 what
 do
 you


want
 to
 ask
 the
 CEO
 of
 Lego?"
 And
 then


she
 went
 completely
 silent
 and
 she
 said,


"If
 you
 meet
 the
 CEO
 of
 Lego,
 you
 have


to
 thank
 him
 for
 having
 made
 my


16-year-old
 son
 interested
 in


engineering."


>> Fantastic.
 So
 on
 behalf
 of
 her
 and


millions
 of
 others,
 you
 know,
 thank
 you


for
 what
 you
 have
 done.
 It's
 incredible.


So
 let's
 just
 start
 at
 the
 top.
 What


what
 does
 it
 really
 mean
 to
 inspire
 and


develop
 the
 builders
 of
 tomorrow
 because


that's
 what
 you
 say
 you're
 doing.
 Yeah,


it
 uh
 it
 of
 course
 takes
 the
 outset
 in


children
 and
 we
 believe
 that
 children


are
 our
 role
 models
 in
 in
 the
 way
 they


do
 the
 creative
 way
 they
 attack
 the


world
 and
 we
 know
 that
 we
 actually


provide
 something
 that
 helps
 children


acquire
 some
 of
 the
 skills
 they
 need
 to


to
 live
 in
 society
 more
 basic
 skills


that
 what
 we
 actually
 teach
 children
 in


school
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 what
 we
 learned


over
 the
 years
 that's
 very
 applicable
 to


children
 but
 it's
 applicable
 to
 all
 of


us


>> why
 do
 they
 love
 building
 things


>> um
 yeah
 I
 I
 guess
 it's
 Uh
 it's
 about


this
 in
 in
 it's
 about
 the
 creativity
 I


think
 that's
 built
 into
 us
 people.
 I


think
 everything
 from
 when
 we
 back
 5,000


years
 ago
 we
 were
 we
 were
 making
 a


hammer
 out
 of
 stone
 where
 this
 this
 uh


desire
 and
 drive
 to
 create
 things.
 I


think
 this
 is
 what
 legal
 bricks
 provide.


>> I
 learned
 a
 new
 expression
 today
 when
 I


walked
 around
 in
 your
 factory.
 Clutch


power.
 Yes.


>> The
 way
 the
 way
 that
 bricks
 kind
 of
 fit


together,
 there
 must
 be
 something
 very


satisfactory
 with
 the
 clutch
 power.
 How


important
 is
 the
 parents
 influence?
 I


mean
 we
 were
 brought
 up
 with
 with
 bricks


just
 uh
 how
 h
 in
 what
 way
 does
 it
 go
 in


in
 generations
 s
 this


>> yeah
 it's
 uh
 it
 is
 important
 for
 for
 the


kids
 part
 it's
 less
 important
 for
 the


for
 the
 adult
 part
 because
 we
 do
 sell
 to


to
 all
 consumers
 today
 but
 for
 kids


adults
 are
 typically
 the
 best
 ambassador


to
 bring
 to
 bring
 the
 first
 legal
 brick


set
 in
 we
 know
 that
 building
 together


adult
 and
 kid
 is
 very
 developing
 and


very
 exciting
 actually
 for
 both
 parties


so
 so
 obviously
 following
 that
 there
 is


a
 big
 advantage
 is
 in
 the
 countries


where
 I
 mean
 I
 guess
 you
 and
 I
 being


Scandinavians
 have
 had
 the
 pleasure
 of


playing
 with
 Lego
 bricks
 when
 we
 were


children
 that's
 not
 the
 case
 everywhere


particularly
 in
 Asia
 in
 China
 in
 India


it
 wasn't
 necessarily
 like
 that
 so
 uh
 in


some
 parts
 you
 almost
 have
 parents
 as
 a


natural
 ambassador
 in
 other
 parts
 we
 are


building
 the
 brand
 as
 we
 go


>> uh
 and
 uh
 and
 so
 there's
 a
 difference


there
 but
 it's
 uh
 it's
 super
 important


it's
 it's
 interesting
 when
 you
 said
 the


wife
 or
 the
 the
 lady
 you
 were
 sitting


next
 to
 I
 am
 probably
 one
 of
 the
 CEOs


who
 gets
 most
 emails
 and
 letters
 from


kids
 and
 parents.
 Just
 within
 the
 last


24
 hours,
 I've
 had
 three
 thanking
 me
 for


what
 we
 do,
 reminding
 them
 of
 what
 they


did
 as
 kids
 and
 uh
 and
 telling
 me
 how


that
 has
 been
 fantastic
 for
 their


children
 or
 grandchildren
 and
 it's
 uh


it's
 super
 rewarding.


>> What
 does
 a
 brand
 What
 does
 a
 Lego
 brand


mean?
 What
 does
 it
 what
 does
 it


encompass?
 Yeah,
 it
 it
 I
 mean
 it


encompasses
 our
 our
 our
 values
 in
 a


sense.
 So
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 creativity,


there's
 imagination,
 there's
 kind
 of


this
 uh
 um
 yeah
 I
 consider
 it
 a
 medium


with
 which
 you
 can
 impress
 everything


you
 you
 want
 to
 do
 or
 express
 yourself


in
 a
 different
 way
 or
 it's
 uh
 it's


almost
 like
 something
 it's
 like
 writing


in
 a
 sense
 you
 can
 use
 the
 Lego
 bricks


for
 what
 you
 want
 to
 do
 and
 the
 creation


you
 make
 is
 your
 creation.
 It's
 not
 a


Lego
 creation
 in
 that
 sense.
 So
 I
 think


it
 allows
 for
 that
 and
 and
 the
 brand


encompasses
 all
 that.
 I
 think


>> how
 many
 Lego
 bricks
 are
 there
 in
 the


world
 now?


>> Oh,
 that's
 a
 good
 question.


>> Somewhere
 I
 think
 between
 500
 billion


and
 a,000
 billion.


>> It's
 a
 big
 number.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 big
 number.
 Um,
 and
 the
 fun


thing
 is
 when
 you
 get
 a
 new
 set,
 you


kind
 of
 add
 on
 what
 you
 already
 have.
 So


you
 have
 this
 kind
 of
 uh
 you
 know
 in
 a


way
 it's
 a
 flywheel
 or
 kind
 of
 a


platform.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 It
 is
 a
 platform.
 I
 I


consider
 Lego
 bricks
 actually
 being
 the


ultimate
 platform
 or
 the
 ultimate


modular
 system
 and
 uh
 I
 mean
 every


company
 talking
 about
 how
 can
 we


platformize
 things
 to
 make
 those
 more


efficient.
 They
 always
 use
 the
 Lego


bricks
 as
 the
 example
 for
 that.
 So
 I


think
 that
 that
 sits
 very
 deeply
 in
 our


roots
 of
 course
 that
 everything
 we
 do


better
 be
 optimized
 from
 a
 modularity


point
 of
 view.


>> Yeah.
 Now
 kids
 uh
 change
 the
 way
 they


spend
 their
 time.
 Just
 how
 does
 this


digital


addiction
 uh
 impact
 your
 business?


>> It's
 um
 I
 mean
 it
 makes
 it
 harder
 to


stay
 relevant
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 we
 are
 actually
 we
 consider


ourselves
 competing
 for
 children's
 time.


>> Yeah.


>> More
 than
 just
 just
 competing
 as
 a
 toy.


And
 and
 you're
 right.
 I
 mean
 children


actually
 in
 many
 countries
 around
 the


globe
 they
 spend
 more
 time
 on
 school.


they
 spend
 time
 on
 after
 school
 whenever


they're
 off
 that
 they're
 typically
 on
 a


tablet
 or
 a
 computer
 and
 uh
 so
 so
 it's


it's
 it's
 just
 a
 harder
 game
 to
 stay


relevant
 on
 that.
 We
 know
 then
 when
 kids


really
 get
 into
 it
 they
 get
 super


excited.
 We
 know
 parents
 like
 it
 and
 we


know
 all
 the
 important
 development


criteria.
 You
 have
 to
 use
 your
 brain
 and


your
 hand
 in
 a
 coordinated
 way
 to
 build


that
 um
 these
 methorical
 skills
 to
 build


the
 right
 connections
 in
 the
 brain


earlier
 on.
 We
 know
 that
 and
 I
 think
 we


are
 we're
 just
 a
 a
 prime
 tool
 for
 doing


that.


>> So,
 uh


>> do
 you
 think
 something
 has
 changed
 with


children's
 fantasy
 and
 imagination


>> so
 far?
 Not
 not
 uh
 not
 a
 lot.
 Uh
 and


which
 is
 a
 positive
 I
 think
 and
 and
 I


also
 think
 we
 have
 to
 we
 have
 to
 uh
 also


have
 to
 say
 that
 being
 on
 digital


screens
 is
 not
 bad.
 It
 just
 cannot
 be


the
 only
 thing
 you
 do.
 We
 we
 typically


see
 if
 you
 do
 do
 what
 you
 said
 before,


you
 take
 this
 big
 bin
 of
 uh
 Lego
 bricks,


you
 throw
 them
 on
 the
 on
 the
 floor,
 kids


will
 build
 like
 you
 and
 I
 would
 build


back
 then.
 It's
 not
 that
 different,


which
 I
 think
 is
 quite
 encouraging.


>> Yeah.
 But
 you
 also
 interact
 via
 the


digital
 world.


>> Yeah.


>> With
 your
 legal
 products,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> What
 kind
 of
 things
 do
 you
 do?


>> Yeah.
 It's
 uh
 if
 you
 think
 about


competing
 for
 time,
 you
 want
 to
 be


relevant.
 You you
 cannot
 kind
 of
 be
 a


Lego
 brand
 and
 then
 say
 we
 are
 only
 in


the
 physical
 world
 because
 that
 that's


over.
 So
 you
 want
 to
 be
 where
 kids
 are


and
 where
 where
 consumers
 are.
 So
 we


have
 we
 have
 games,
 we
 have
 uh
 we
 have
 a


Lego
 play
 social
 media
 platforms,
 we


have
 a
 lot
 of
 IP
 partners
 where
 we
 also


work
 very
 heavily
 into
 digital
 because


kids
 want
 that.


>> But
 they
 expect
 of
 course
 and


representation
 in
 digital
 of
 the
 LEGO


brand
 that
 is
 authentic
 to
 what
 it
 is.


And
 that's
 our
 challenge
 to
 make
 sure
 we


show
 up


>> the
 right
 way
 with
 the
 right
 values
 no


matter
 whether
 it's
 in
 digital
 or
 or


physical


>> in
 your
 own
 product
 development.
 How
 do


you
 foster
 creativity?


>> That
 brings
 a
 smile
 to
 my
 face
 all
 the


time
 because
 we
 are
 a
 super
 creative


company.
 And
 if
 there's
 something
 if
 you


get
 the
 opportunity
 to
 walk
 alongside


the
 department
 we
 have
 of
 Lego


designers.
 I
 mean


>> how
 many
 people
 do
 you
 have?


>> We
 have
 uh
 I
 think
 we
 have
 around
 600


designers.


>> Oh
 wow.
 And
 how
 do
 they
 how
 do
 they
 how


do
 they
 go
 about
 figuring
 out
 what
 to


make?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 very
 different
 approaches


because
 you
 would
 have
 everything
 from


designers
 or
 trained
 designers
 to


architects
 to
 engineers,
 all
 kinds
 of


people.
 It's
 almost
 like
 it's
 I
 mean
 a


Lego
 designer
 that's
 something
 you


really
 want
 to
 be
 and
 you
 are
 really


willing
 to
 lean
 into
 that
 and
 people


work
 for
 years
 to
 to
 to
 get
 to
 that


skill
 and
 uh
 and
 uh
 if
 you're
 Lego


designer
 you
 work
 in
 this
 town.
 So
 you


work
 in
 this
 place
 in
 the
 middle
 of


Jutland
 in
 Denmark
 because
 we
 have


liquid
 designers
 nowhere
 else


>> because
 this
 town
 is
 billand


>> in
 the
 middle
 middle
 of
 Denmark.
 And
 how


many
 citizens
 have
 you
 got?


>> Probably
 uh
 10,000
 in
 in
 in
 the
 town
 and


6,000
 people
 working
 for
 us.


>> No,
 but
 the
 point
 is
 just
 we
 have
 we


have
 the
 designers
 together.
 So
 you


really
 create
 this
 super
 creative


atmosphere
 where
 they
 can
 work
 up
 along


each
 other
 where
 we
 can
 support
 them
 in


the
 best
 possible
 way.
 I
 mean
 they
 have


access
 every
 day
 to
 every
 single
 Lego


brick
 that
 exists
 in
 every
 single
 color.


They
 have
 all
 kinds
 of
 systems


supporting
 and
 they
 have
 this
 uh
 very


creative
 uh
 environment
 that
 that
 allows


them
 to
 to
 uh
 to
 um
 be
 creative.


>> How
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 create
 that


environment?
 What
 does
 it
 take?


>> I
 mean
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 physical


building
 part
 to
 that
 that
 needs
 to
 be


need
 needs
 to
 be
 exciting
 and
 that's
 an


area
 we're
 actually
 even
 moving
 further


on.
 But
 it's
 that
 also
 the
 freedom
 you


give
 them.
 So
 you
 if
 you
 get
 the
 right


type
 of
 people
 and
 you
 allow
 them
 to
 be


creative
 in
 what
 they
 do.
 So
 we
 don't


control
 them
 much.
 We
 uh
 we
 I
 mean


>> it's
 a
 play
 it's
 a
 proper
 playground.


>> It
 is
 every
 two
 weeks
 they
 have
 a
 day


where
 they
 can
 do
 exactly
 what
 they
 want


to
 outside
 any
 program.
 We
 do
 get
 have


to
 get
 products
 out
 the
 door,
 but
 we


need
 to
 allow
 them
 to
 all
 the
 time
 have


their
 ideas
 come
 up
 and
 uh
 come
 out
 and


uh
 and
 uh
 so
 it's
 it's
 quite
 an
 exciting


area
 to
 be
 in
 and
 it's
 um
 it's
 uh
 yeah


it
 is
 very
 creative
 and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


very
 creative
 people
 in
 the
 company
 and


>> where
 do
 where
 do
 good
 ideas
 come
 from


generally
 in
 life?


>> I
 mean
 they
 can
 come
 from
 many
 many


places
 but
 I
 think
 they
 get
 inspired
 by


by
 their
 own
 passions
 or
 their
 own
 type


of
 building
 technique.
 Yeah.
 Can
 also
 be


inspired
 by
 us
 looking
 into
 what
 are
 the


trends
 in
 the
 world.
 I
 mean
 Formula
 1,


we
 have
 a
 strategic
 partnership
 with


Formula
 1.
 Yes,
 we've
 been
 in
 vehicles,


but
 now
 suddenly
 that
 opens
 up
 a
 world


for
 some
 designers
 or
 animals
 for
 for


kids
 if
 you
 know
 you're
 into
 that.
 You


can
 you
 can
 be
 a
 creative
 around
 a


theme,
 but
 you
 can
 also
 be
 openly


creative.
 And
 uh
 the
 flowers
 we
 see
 on


the
 table,
 I
 mean,
 that's
 an
 open


creation.
 The
 first
 time
 I
 saw
 that,
 I


wasn't
 even
 certain
 whether
 that
 would


be
 a
 good
 idea
 or
 not.
 But
 uh
 but
 um


that
 just
 came
 out
 of
 a
 designer.
 They


tried
 it
 out
 and
 we
 said,
 "Okay,
 let's


try
 it
 and
 if
 it
 works,
 we'll
 do
 more


and
 if
 it
 doesn't,
 we
 would
 we
 would


stop
 this
 in
 this
 case."


>> Yeah.
 What
 I
 can
 say
 is
 that
 check
 out


the
 floral
 uh
 uh
 you
 know,
 creations
 you


had
 here
 cuz
 I'm
 thinking
 about
 uh


putting
 some
 in
 my
 office
 instead
 of
 uh


>> flowers.
 It's
 very
 cool.


>> Um
 now
 you
 personally
 are
 involved
 and


you
 are
 approving


products
 and
 so
 on.
 this
 how
 how
 does


how
 does
 this
 whole
 process
 work?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 because
 it's
 interesting
 when


you
 talk
 I
 mean
 you
 and
 maybe
 I
 start


with
 saying
 every
 year
 we
 change
 50%
 of


our
 product
 line.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that's
 how
 many
 that's
 how


many
 hundreds


>> that's
 that
 would
 be
 around
 400
 now
 or


450
 products
 that
 have
 to
 come
 every


year.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 uh


>> not
 many
 companies
 change
 their
 product


range
 every
 two
 years.


>> No.


>> No.
 So
 you
 can
 say
 we
 we're
 no
 better
 at


any
 point
 in
 time
 than
 the
 creativity
 we


are
 coming
 out
 with
 right
 now.
 Uh
 so
 so


uh
 we
 talked
 about
 the
 creative
 side
 and


kind
 of
 some
 of
 the
 things
 we
 do
 to
 to


allow
 them
 to
 be
 super
 creative
 but
 the


creative
 process
 if
 you
 look
 at
 it
 from


the
 idea
 to
 the
 product
 is
 also
 quite


structured.
 So
 we
 have
 we
 call
 them
 P


meetings.
 So
 we
 have
 a
 series
 of
 P


meetings
 throughout
 the
 year
 where
 we


bring
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 together
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 how
 does
 how
 do
 the
 ideas
 we


have
 and
 the
 and
 the
 concepts
 we
 have


how
 do
 this
 play
 up
 against
 what
 are
 the


trends
 in
 the
 world?
 What's
 is
 it


Formula
 Formula
 1
 that's
 attractive?
 Is


it
 Star
 Wars
 this
 year
 that's
 coming
 out


with
 a
 new
 movie?
 What
 is
 it
 that
 would


really
 drive
 attention?
 Is
 it
 Pokémon?


Is
 it
 Super
 Mario?
 What
 are
 the
 things


that
 are
 hot
 IPs
 or
 will
 be
 hot
 IPs
 one


or
 two
 years
 out?


>> Do
 you
 check
 with
 kids?


>> We
 check
 with
 kids.
 We
 check
 a
 lot
 with


kids.
 We
 check
 with
 adults.
 And
 then
 of


course
 we
 have
 uh
 given
 the
 strength
 of


the
 brand,
 we
 have
 very
 strong


cooperations
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 brands
 and


IPs
 out
 there.
 And
 that
 gives
 us
 also


the
 privilege
 of
 having
 insights
 into


what
 is
 coming.
 So
 if
 you
 know
 what
 the


movie
 slates
 are
 that
 will
 be
 there
 in


the
 next
 year
 or
 two,
 you
 have
 a
 much


better
 chance
 of
 hitting
 hitting
 right


on
 your
 prioritization.


>> Are
 there
 some
 uh
 models
 you
 keep


forever?
 Do
 you
 have
 some
 evergreens?


>> Yes.


>> Yes.
 What
 are
 they?


>> I
 take
 a
 um
 an
 example
 would
 be
 Titanic.


So
 we
 have
 the
 Titanic.
 You
 build
 that


from
 several
 thousand
 bricks.
 You
 build


everything
 in
 there
 and
 you
 close
 it


down
 so
 only
 you
 know
 what's
 inside.


It's
 kind
 of
 this
 size.


>> So
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 big
 set.


>> More
 than
 a
 meter.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that's
 something
 that
 uh
 that


uh
 I
 mean
 that's
 that's
 an
 evergreen


that
 will
 stay
 for
 a
 long
 long
 time.
 I


won't
 say
 it
 would
 ever
 not
 ever
 go
 out,


but
 it's
 not
 something
 that
 goes
 in
 and


out
 in
 a
 year
 or
 two
 uh
 as
 most
 products


would
 do.


>> What's
 kind
 of
 the
 most
 complicated
 set


you
 have?
 How
 many
 pieces?


>> 10,000
 pieces.


>> 10,000.


>> Yeah.


>> Wow.
 You
 said
 the
 Star
 Wars
 city
 or


something.


>> Yeah,
 it
 would
 be
 a
 huge
 No,
 it
 would
 be


a
 Star
 Wars
 Millennium
 Falcon
 would
 be
 a


big
 one.
 The
 uh
 the
 Colosum
 would
 be
 a


big
 one.
 The
 Eiffel
 Tower
 is
 a
 very
 big


one.
 Titanic
 is
 a
 big
 one.
 So
 that
 that


would
 be
 the
 as
 you
 say
 like
 a
 meter
 or


a
 meter
 and
 a
 half
 high
 or
 really
 big


constructions
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 bricks
 in


them.


>> In
 the
 old
 days
 uh
 uh
 more
 girls
 I'm


sorry
 more
 boys
 than
 girls
 were
 into


Lego.
 Now
 that
 you
 have
 managed
 to


change
 that
 a
 bit.


>> Yeah.
 Now
 we've
 been
 very
 focused
 on


being
 a
 brand
 for
 everybody.
 So
 both
 for


for
 both
 genders
 of
 of
 kids
 but
 also


growing
 into
 teens
 and
 into
 adults.
 But


you're
 right,
 we
 are
 much
 more
 balanced


between
 boys
 and
 girls
 today.
 Moving
 on


to
 ownership
 and
 culture.
 So,
 uh,
 LEGO


is
 a
 family-owned
 company.
 How
 does
 that


impact
 the
 way
 you
 work?


>> Yeah.
 Right.
 We've
 been
 familyowned
 for


for
 90
 93
 years.
 Same
 family,
 first


generation.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh,
 it
 um
 uh
 it
 gives
 us
 an
 opportunity


to
 take
 decisions
 with
 a
 slightly
 longer


perspective.
 So
 we
 can
 carry
 through


some
 investment
 programs
 and
 we
 can
 also


sometimes
 carry
 through
 uh
 smaller


smaller
 blips
 or
 hiccups
 in
 a
 quarter.


So
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 very


creative,
 you
 want
 to
 take
 some
 chances


and
 not
 everything
 pays
 out
 and
 you


shouldn't
 panic
 if
 that
 happens.
 You


need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 stand
 through
 that.
 I


think
 I
 think
 we've
 had
 good
 examples
 of


uh
 of
 doing
 that
 and
 we
 we
 are
 using


that
 by
 actually
 also
 having
 quite
 quite


a
 long
 perspective
 in
 some
 of
 our
 plans.


>> Yeah.
 because
 we
 can
 sign
 up
 we
 can
 sign


up
 with
 an
 owner
 family
 um
 for
 the


longer
 term
 on
 some
 of
 those
 things.
 I


think
 that's
 been
 the
 biggest
 uh
 biggest


advantage.


>> Yeah.
 You
 did
 go
 through
 a
 period
 though


where
 you
 which
 was
 a
 bit
 more
 rocky.


What
 happened
 then?


>> No,
 I
 think
 the
 um
 I
 mean
 we
 talked


about
 the
 creative
 side.
 You
 can
 imagine


with
 so
 many
 creative
 people
 running


around
 you
 can
 create
 a
 lot
 of


complexity
 in
 very
 short
 term
 if
 you're


not
 uh
 if
 you
 if
 you're
 not
 careful.
 And


I
 think
 we've
 had
 periods
 where
 where


the
 complexity
 had
 grown
 too
 much
 u
 and


and
 that
 of
 course
 makes
 it
 more


difficult
 to
 execute
 in
 the
 right
 way


and
 and
 to
 control
 uh
 all
 things.
 So


that's
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we
 are


that
 we
 all
 the
 time
 or
 it
 also
 takes
 a


lot
 of
 my
 focus
 balancing
 between
 being


creative
 but
 also
 being
 very
 structured


with
 an
 operating
 model
 that
 allows
 us


to
 execute
 these
 many
 billions
 of
 of
 of


bricks
 that
 we
 need
 to
 get
 out
 and
 that


all
 of
 these
 sets
 every
 year
 all
 these


launches
 that
 they
 hit
 just
 right
 and
 do


that
 that
 actually
 is
 a
 balance
 between


the
 two
 things
 and
 if
 that
 gets
 out
 of


balance
 that
 typically
 creates
 problem


for
 us.


>> Yeah.
 How
 many
 years
 did
 you
 have


problems
 for?


>> We
 had
 uh
 in
 the
 um
 around
 year
 2000
 I


think
 there
 was
 a
 period
 of
 five
 or
 six


or
 seven
 years
 around
 16
 17
 it
 was
 kind


of
 a
 two
 year
 a
 2-year
 period
 where
 we


lost
 momentum
 before
 we
 came
 we
 came


back


>> and
 now
 you
 have
 really
 come
 back
 with
 a


vengeance
 right
 so
 you've
 been
 growing


close
 to
 15%
 for
 the
 last
 few
 years.


Yeah,


>> that's
 a
 very
 very
 high
 growth
 rate
 in
 a


pretty
 flat
 industry,
 right?


>> Yes,
 exactly.


>> How
 how
 what
 do
 you
 think
 is
 the
 fastest


a
 company
 could
 grow?


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 in
 a
 in
 a
 kind
 of
 sensible
 way.


>> Yeah.


>> Well,
 it's
 it's
 a
 super
 good
 question


because
 that's
 kind
 of
 that's
 kind
 of


the
 upper
 limit
 your
 question
 asking


there
 is
 there
 a
 limit
 to
 how
 fast
 it


makes
 sense
 to
 grow.
 On
 the
 other
 side,


there's
 also
 a


>> lower
 limit
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 in
 a


business
 like
 ours,
 it's
 really
 a


momentum
 business.
 If
 we
 can
 grow
 at
 a


decent
 pace,
 we
 can
 afford
 to
 make
 all


the
 forward-looking
 investments
 that


will
 drive
 that
 that
 again.
 I
 actually


once
 made
 a
 had
 a
 consultant
 come
 in


making
 more
 of
 an
 analytical
 exercise
 on


what
 projects
 the
 growth.
 The
 best


projector
 of
 high
 growth
 is
 that
 we
 grew


fast
 the
 year
 before.


>> Right.
 Right.


>> Which
 is
 interesting
 in
 the
 sense
 that


momentum
 yields
 momentum.
 So,


>> well,
 we're
 talking
 about
 Formula
 1,


Schumacher
 said
 that,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 for


the
 perfect
 machine,
 uh,
 speed
 is
 a


unifying
 force
 or
 something
 along
 those


lines.


>> But
 there's
 something
 to
 that
 and
 I'm


aware
 that
 actually
 puts
 that
 I'm
 I'm


eager
 to
 have
 the
 growth
 being
 at
 a
 good


pace,


>> but
 of
 course,
 I'm
 nervous
 if
 that


growth
 gets
 to
 the
 point
 that
 gets
 too


high.
 So,
 probably
 the
 15
 you
 mentioned


should
 it's
 probably
 at
 the
 limit
 that
 I


think
 a
 company
 like
 ours
 can
 sustain


for
 the
 long
 term.
 And
 and
 remember
 we
 I


mean
 we
 built
 all
 our
 products


ourselves.
 So
 so
 it's
 not
 like
 we
 can


just
 source
 something
 more
 from


somebody.
 It
 means
 factories.
 It
 means


distribution
 centers.
 It
 means
 a
 setup


that's
 that's
 quite
 quite
 big
 and


growing
 faster
 than
 that.
 I
 think


>> what's
 the
 risk
 what's
 the
 risk
 to


growing
 faster?
 Where
 where
 does
 the


risk
 come
 in?
 uh
 I
 think
 it
 comes
 from


uh
 complexity
 growing
 too
 fast
 or
 us
 not


being
 able
 to
 uh
 to
 deliver
 the
 capacity


to
 follow
 because
 you
 you
 need
 to
 build


quite
 some
 square
 meters
 in
 in


manufacturing
 every
 year
 to
 sustain
 the


15%
 and
 everything
 that
 goes
 with
 it
 and


uh
 and
 it's
 it's
 it's
 hard
 maybe
 you
 can


do
 it
 in
 a
 single
 year
 but
 not
 year


after
 year
 I
 think


>> what
 are
 the
 challenges
 to
 scaling
 the


culture


>> um
 I
 think
 what
 we're
 learning
 is
 that


um
 that
 uh
 I
 mean
 we
 sit
 in
 billon


together
 here
 we
 sit
 in
 our
 liquor
 on


campus.
 We
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 employees
 here


and
 we
 have
 many
 who
 have
 been
 here
 for


20,
 30,
 40
 years.
 So
 recruiting
 into


this
 area,
 we
 could
 take
 a
 thousand


people
 tomorrow
 and
 I
 would
 feel
 pretty


certain
 that
 very
 fast
 they
 would
 get


into
 the
 culture.
 Now
 what
 we've
 also


done
 is
 we
 created
 hubs
 in
 parts
 of
 the


world
 where
 we
 wanted
 to
 put
 on
 new


capabilities.
 An
 example
 is
 in


Copenhagen.
 So
 we
 started
 out
 open
 an


office
 and
 got
 between
 three
 and
 400


digital
 experts
 into
 an
 office
 like


that.
 that
 takes
 a
 little
 bit
 longer


because
 you
 cannot
 mix
 them
 up
 with
 with


culture
 carriers
 that
 we
 have.
 So
 that


takes
 a
 much
 stronger
 effort
 to
 do
 that.


Similarly,
 when
 we
 start
 a
 factory
 in


Vietnam,
 just
 green
 field
 and
 we
 start


by
 recruiting
 that
 and
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of


we
 actually
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 emphasis
 on


how
 do
 we
 do
 that?
 How
 do
 we
 bring


people
 in
 who
 carries
 the
 culture
 and


how
 can
 we
 be
 very
 precise
 on
 that?
 But


it's
 an
 it's
 an
 ongoing
 focus


>> uh
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 that
 happens


because
 having
 a
 strong
 culture
 is
 only


really
 valuable
 if
 you
 have
 it


throughout.
 If
 you
 only
 have
 it
 in


pockets
 then
 I'm
 not
 sure
 it's
 so


valuable.


>> How
 do
 you
 deal
 with
 failure?


>> Um


I
 mean
 when
 you
 are
 as
 creative
 as
 we


are
 we
 are
 creating
 failures.
 Um
 if
 you


call
 it
 failure
 I
 try
 not
 to
 call
 it


failure
 in
 the
 sense
 because
 there's


there's
 a


>> what
 do
 you
 call
 it?
 failure
 it


I
 don't
 have
 a
 good
 name
 for
 that
 but
 we


try
 very
 hard
 to
 not
 kind
 of
 um
 make
 the


failure
 thing
 a
 very
 negative
 thing
 so


so
 we
 uh
 we
 call
 it
 a
 AAR
 so
 the


afteraction
 review
 where
 we
 try
 to
 take


the
 learnings
 out
 so
 uh
 so
 it's
 the
 kind


of
 a
 failure
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 repeat


the
 failure
 and
 at
 least
 you
 want
 to
 get


out
 of
 the
 failure
 with
 a
 learning


>> yeah
 no
 you
 never
 want
 to
 repeat


mistakes
 because
 there's
 so
 many
 to
 take


from


>> Exactly
 and
 and
 it
 doesn't
 make
 I
 mean


that's
 what
 hurts
 if
 you
 see
 the
 same


mistake
 happening
 twice.
 We
 actually
 had


an
 example
 of
 this
 this
 year.
 That's


when
 it
 really
 hurts
 and
 that's
 when
 you


uh
 you
 look
 deeper.
 But


>> so
 what
 do
 you
 call
 it?
 After
 action


>> after
 action
 review.


>> Okay.
 How
 does
 that
 how
 does
 that
 work?


So
 it's
 an
 actual
 debrief,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 It's
 a
 it's
 it's
 a
 strong
 debrief


that
 that
 along
 a
 fixed
 model
 have
 to


come
 out
 with
 what
 are
 the
 learnings


we're
 taking
 and
 where
 do
 we
 apply
 those


learnings.
 So


>> how
 does
 what
 does
 a
 model
 look
 like?
 um


for
 this


>> uh
 modeling
 I
 mean
 we
 basically
 there's


there
 is
 a
 uh
 there's
 around
 a
 certain


project
 there's
 a
 a
 list
 of
 people
 you


need
 to
 have
 in
 this
 uh
 review
 you
 have


to
 describe
 what
 happened
 and
 you
 have


to
 be
 very
 specific
 on
 why
 why
 did
 we


end
 up
 in
 this
 situation
 what's
 the


learning
 we
 take
 out
 of
 that
 so
 we
 can


apply
 that
 uh
 across
 I
 mean
 sometimes


out
 of
 what
 is
 a
 failure
 you
 can


actually
 tweak
 some
 things
 or
 do


something
 slightly
 differently
 or
 adjust


and
 you
 can
 bring
 it
 back
 on
 or
 out
 of


that
 you
 close
 it
 totally
 down
 and
 you


conclude
 I'm
 never
 going
 to
 do
 that


again
 and
 you
 go
 ahead
 to
 do
 something


else


>> and
 that's
 what
 and
 and
 the
 and
 it's


it's
 really
 about
 not
 going
 on
 too
 long


before
 before
 that
 happens
 and
 then


you're
 really
 learning
 from
 it
 to
 not


>> how
 often
 do
 you
 do
 this
 a
 ars


>> oh
 I
 would
 think
 there's
 probably
 one
 in


the
 company
 every
 day


>> uh
 but
 on
 big
 and
 small
 so
 I
 mean
 the


big
 ones
 hopefully
 not
 that
 often
 but
 uh


but
 I
 mean
 there
 will
 be
 there
 will
 be


significant
 things
 that
 we
 will
 learn


from
 at
 least
 four
 times
 a
 year
 at
 a


certain
 scale
 that
 would
 would
 also
 yeah


be
 at
 my
 attention.


>> What
 are
 some
 of
 the
 things
 you
 have


learned


>> uh
 let's
 say
 last
 over
 the
 last
 year?


Oh,
 that's
 that's
 there's
 many
 um
 uh
 I


mean
 many
 different
 things.
 We
 have


those
 on
 products.
 Uh
 we
 have
 been
 it's


typically
 things
 that
 will
 go
 on
 for
 a


while.
 So
 we
 I
 mean
 we've
 been
 launching


new
 themes
 back
 in
 the
 days
 of
 augmented


reality.
 So
 uh
 two
 or
 three
 or
 four


years
 back
 we
 we
 launched
 a
 new
 set


called
 Hidden
 Sight
 and
 it
 was
 it
 was


quite
 fancy.
 You
 had
 a
 you
 had
 your


mobile
 phone,
 you
 could
 uh
 you
 could


have
 this
 building
 and
 suddenly
 you


could
 bring
 it
 alive
 with
 ghosts
 that


were
 flying
 and
 you
 can
 make
 things


around
 that.
 It
 was
 complicated.
 We


never
 really
 managed
 to
 bring
 that
 to


big
 success.
 Not
 because
 necessarily
 the


idea
 was
 not
 good
 but
 we
 we
 were
 not


successful
 with
 that
 and
 we
 had
 to
 sit


down
 and
 say
 what
 are
 the
 elements
 here


that
 were
 were
 wrong
 or
 we
 didn't
 do


right
 and
 and
 is
 there
 also
 any
 positive


learning
 we
 can
 take
 out
 of
 that
 or
 if


you
 take
 sustainability
 we
 have
 been
 um


we
 were
 testing
 600
 materials
 to
 find


materials
 that
 had
 less
 uh
 less
 CO2
 less


fertile
 fuel
 and
 were
 more
 more
 more


mixed
 and
 uh
 and
 at
 one
 point
 we


actually
 proved
 that
 uh
 our
 pet
 so
 uh
 so


um
 recycled
 PET
 from
 PET
 bottles
 and
 so


could
 could
 be
 used
 into
 Lego
 bricks
 and


could
 partly
 or
 could
 fulfill
 some
 of


the
 very
 strong
 tolerances
 and
 the


requirements
 we
 had.
 Now
 getting
 towards


the
 actually
 doing
 it,
 we
 figured
 out
 it


did
 not
 lower
 CO2.
 It
 brought
 a
 lot
 of


other
 problems
 uh
 with
 it
 uh
 and
 uh
 and


there
 were
 too
 many
 compromises
 on
 the


quality
 of
 the
 brick
 or
 the
 sound
 of
 the


brick
 or
 whatever.
 So
 we
 decided
 not
 to


do
 it.
 Um
 that
 was
 uh
 that
 was


considered
 I
 mean
 I
 had
 to
 deal
 with
 a


lot
 of
 journalists
 around
 explaining
 why


was
 that
 the
 right
 decision
 to
 do
 but
 I


think
 we
 came
 out
 of
 it
 stronger
 and
 in


a
 better
 situation
 today
 because
 we


actually
 we
 yeah
 we
 do
 it
 we
 d
 bring
 it


all
 the
 way
 to
 the
 finish
 line
 although


we
 decided
 not
 to
 do
 it
 at
 the
 end.


>> Yeah.
 No
 I
 I
 can
 see
 why
 you
 need
 to


spend
 time
 on
 sustainability
 but
 on
 the


other
 hand
 you
 know
 uh
 your
 plastic
 is


kind
 of
 the
 one
 of
 the
 few
 plastic


things
 that
 we
 don't
 throw
 away.


>> Are
 you
 right?
 It's
 it's
 a
 durable
 uh


kind
 of
 pleasure.


>> Yes.
 I
 And
 for
 that
 I
 actually
 think
 we


are
 the
 we're
 one
 of
 the
 best
 uses
 of


plastic.
 Yeah.
 You
 can
 think
 of
 for
 that


reason.
 You
 you
 can
 have
 a
 brick
 for
 for


40
 years.
 Uh
 and
 and
 it
 it
 keep
 it
 keeps


getting
 in
 in
 in
 in
 play.
 You
 give
 it
 to


your
 grandchildren
 or
 your
 children
 and


it
 brings
 on
 and
 one
 of
 the
 requirements


on
 our
 side
 is
 that
 we
 ensure
 this


backward
 compatibility.
 So
 you
 can
 buy
 a


set
 tomorrow
 and
 you
 can
 bring
 it


together
 with
 the
 set
 your
 grandparents


bought
 and
 has
 probably
 been
 in
 the


bathtub
 or
 outside
 in
 the
 sun
 and


whatever.
 And
 the
 clutch
 power
 you


talked
 about
 it
 still
 works.


>> So
 that
 I
 think
 is
 a
 fantastic
 use.


That's
 a
 narrative
 we're
 trying
 to
 uh
 to


get
 out
 there.
 But
 it's
 not
 always
 that


easy
 when
 you're
 in
 the
 big
 world
 of


communication
 around
 plastic.


>> How
 are
 you
 trying
 to
 reformulate
 the


plastic
 to
 make
 it
 more
 environmentally


friendly?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 we're
 doing
 two


things.
 I
 think
 the
 starting
 point
 is


really
 making
 sure
 people
 understand
 the


durability
 of
 the
 Lego
 plastic.
 That


being
 said,
 there
 are
 two
 things
 that's


in
 focus.
 One
 is
 that
 we
 would
 like
 to


make
 it
 from
 more
 and
 more
 sustainable


and
 recycled
 materials
 to
 the
 extent


that
 is
 possible.
 And
 secondly,
 we
 would


like
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 it
 doesn't
 end
 up


in
 waste.
 Now
 it
 doesn't
 today,
 but
 with


the
 billions
 we
 talked
 about
 before
 of


bricks
 out
 there.
 If
 there
 are
 people


that
 wants
 to
 give
 the
 brick
 bags,
 the


bricks
 back,
 it
 should
 not
 go
 to
 waste


or
 in
 the
 garbage
 bin,
 then
 we
 would


want
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 provide
 a
 system
 to


bring
 that
 back.
 And
 we
 are
 having


takeback
 solutions
 in
 in
 quite
 a
 few


markets
 today.
 But
 I
 think
 that's


important.
 It's
 not
 a
 big
 deal
 because


as
 you
 said,
 people
 don't
 want
 to
 do


that.
 But
 but
 I
 don't
 want
 a
 situation


where
 somebody
 wants
 to
 and
 we
 cannot
 uh


we
 cannot
 do
 it.
 Now
 the
 third
 thing
 is


really
 that
 if
 you
 are
 into
 durable


plastic
 and
 you
 want
 to
 run
 the
 argument


that
 you
 just
 put
 forward
 uh
 in
 in
 your


question
 then
 don't
 have
 single-use


plastic
 around.
 So
 we
 have
 had
 a
 big


undertaking
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 as
 a


company
 externally
 and
 internally
 we
 got


rid
 of
 single-use
 plastic


>> because
 otherwise
 the
 durable
 plastic


story
 is
 not
 a
 strong
 one.


>> So
 now
 your
 bricks
 come
 in
 paper
 bags.


>> Yes.


>> Now
 you
 were
 one
 of the
 first
 companies


to
 tie
 bonuses
 to
 emissions.
 How
 does


this
 work?


>> Um,
 it's
 uh,
 as
 you
 know
 with
 bonuses,


it's
 like
 you
 would
 like
 to
 incentivize


an
 organization
 on
 what's
 good,
 what
 we


want
 to,
 but
 you
 also
 would
 like
 to
 keep


it
 as
 controllable
 as
 possible.
 It's
 not


I
 mean
 you
 and
 I
 don't
 like
 a
 bonus
 that


we
 cannot
 influence
 obviously.
 So
 I


think
 that's
 been
 the
 bigger
 the
 bigger


uh
 the
 bigger
 problem
 here.
 So
 we


focused
 in
 on
 mainly
 scope
 one
 and
 two.


So
 uh
 things
 that
 are
 in
 the
 company's


own
 control
 and
 and
 we
 we
 checked
 on


things
 that
 also
 had
 or
 measure
 on


things
 that
 also
 matters
 from
 employees


point
 of
 view.
 Are
 are
 you
 choosing
 your


company
 car
 to
 be
 an
 electric
 vehicle
 or


not?
 What
 choices
 are
 we
 also
 making


internally?
 So
 most
 of
 the
 bonus
 at
 this


point
 in
 time
 are
 on
 those
 kind
 of


things.
 Now
 we
 have
 an
 ambition
 to
 very


soon
 move
 to
 a
 broader


>> uh
 and
 basically
 say
 listen
 if
 the


overall
 ambition
 for
 the
 world
 is
 to
 get


CO2
 down
 then
 uh
 that's
 also
 what
 we
 as


employees
 would
 need
 to
 to
 be
 successful


with.


>> Now
 let's
 um
 travel
 from
 Bon
 to
 uh
 to


Asia.
 Um
 how
 important
 is
 China
 for


LEGO's
 future?


It's
 uh
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 have
 a
 basic


mission
 of
 getting
 to
 every
 child
 in
 the


world
 or
 getting
 to
 as
 many
 children
 in


the
 world
 as
 possible
 then
 China
 and


India
 for
 that
 sake
 are
 very
 important


markets.
 So
 so
 it's
 important
 it's


probably
 more
 important
 purpose
 and


missionwise
 than
 it
 is
 in
 pure


commercials
 if
 you
 look
 at
 it
 today.
 uh


and
 that's
 part
 to
 some
 of
 what
 we


touched
 on
 before
 that
 we
 are
 building
 a


brand
 we
 are
 creating
 uh
 distribution


and
 retail
 uh
 reach
 uh
 while
 uh
 while
 we


also
 starting
 manufacturing
 uh
 so
 so


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 investments
 in
 into


China
 to
 make
 that
 happen
 so
 it
 it
 is


important
 and
 we
 are
 quite
 successful
 uh


in
 China
 right
 now
 and
 we've
 been
 added


for
 the
 last
 15
 years
 I
 would
 say
 uh


significantly
 but
 if
 your
 question
 went


on
 to
 say
 how
 important
 is
 India
 then
 I


would
 say
 then
 we're
 probably
 10
 years


back
 on
 that
 journey
 and
 we
 have
 to


start
 to
 do
 all
 these
 things.
 We're


building
 a
 brand
 in
 a
 country
 that
 was


not
 used
 to
 playing
 with
 Lego
 bricks.


>> How
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 do
 that?
 So,
 here


I
 am.
 I'm
 Danish.
 I
 have
 some
 bricks
 and


here
 we
 go
 to
 India.
 Where
 do
 you
 start?


How
 do you
 how
 do
 you
 start?


>> I
 can
 tell
 you
 what
 we
 did
 in
 China.


>> Okay.


>> Uh
 we
 uh
 we
 started
 out
 probably
 not


unlike
 many
 companies,
 but
 we
 did
 focus


on
 the
 bigger
 metropolitan
 areas.
 So,


it's
 like
 Beijing,
 it's
 Shanghai,
 maybe


Hao,
 some
 of
 the
 bigger
 places
 in
 China.


and
 really
 uh
 at
 the
 same
 time
 started


in
 more
 traditional
 brand
 campaign
 type


thing.
 Uh
 a
 and
 then
 we
 opened
 retail


stores.
 So
 we
 actually
 have
 quite
 a
 few


retail
 stores
 in
 China
 that
 only
 only


has
 the
 Lego
 brand
 in
 them
 because
 this


opportunity


uh
 to
 get
 into
 a
 store
 and
 get
 into
 the


Lego
 universe
 and
 see
 that
 has
 been
 a


very
 important
 way
 and
 it
 does
 better


than
 a
 than
 a
 branding
 campaign
 for
 that


sake.
 So
 you
 have
 to
 I
 think
 invest


along
 several
 dimensions
 at
 the
 same


time


>> and
 that's
 maybe
 an
 area
 where
 it's
 good


to
 be
 familyowned
 because
 that
 uh
 I
 mean


it
 would
 be
 nicer
 if
 you
 could
 invest
 in


brand
 building
 today
 and
 retail
 stores


tomorrow
 and
 then
 product
 portfolio
 the


day
 after
 but
 you
 kind
 of
 do
 have
 to
 do


it
 all
 for
 that
 to
 gel
 and
 actually
 work


out.
 So
 um
 so
 that's
 what
 we've
 done
 in


China
 and
 and
 then
 we
 have
 kind
 of
 taken


it
 from
 the
 bigger
 cities
 now
 to
 tier


two
 to
 tier
 three
 to
 tier
 four
 cities


and
 that
 model
 have
 we've
 replicated


throughout


>> China
 that


>> how
 many
 how
 many
 Legoland
 parks
 have


you
 got
 now
 around
 the
 world?


>> No
 we
 have
 11


>> in
 China.


>> Nope.
 No
 totally


>> we
 have
 one
 in
 China


>> and
 we
 opened
 it
 actually
 a
 month
 ago
 uh


in
 Shanghai.
 Uh
 we're
 building
 another


one
 in
 China.
 Uh
 but
 but
 we
 have
 11


globally.


>> Yeah.
 And
 how
 are
 they
 doing?
 I
 mean


they're
 doing
 well
 and
 uh
 and
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 way
 for
 us
 of
 course for
 us
 to
 to


give
 a
 different
 Lego
 experience
 than


than
 than
 building
 than
 you
 get
 into
 to


the
 Lego
 world.


>> But
 uh
 but
 it's
 not
 you
 you
 cannot
 have


a
 Lego
 land
 park
 in
 every
 small
 town.
 So


in
 that
 sense
 it
 becomes
 a
 little
 bit


different
 and
 something
 you
 you


typically
 have
 to
 travel
 for.


>> And
 then
 and
 then
 you
 got
 more
 than
 a


thousand
 stores.


>> We
 have
 more
 than
 a thousand
 stores
 500


of
 those
 in
 China.
 So so
 in
 that
 sense


it's
 been
 back
 to
 your
 your
 question.


How
 do
 you
 build
 brands?
 Stores
 have


been
 very
 important
 in
 in
 in
 the
 process


of
 building
 a
 brand.


>> What
 uh
 on
 the
 digital
 transformation


just
 uh
 AI,
 how
 do
 you
 benefit
 from


that?


>> Yeah,
 I
 guess
 I'll
 just
 be
 honest
 to
 say


AI
 is
 something
 we
 talk
 a
 lot
 about.


It's
 still
 early
 days
 in
 really
 reaping


benefits.
 We
 we
 actually
 think
 about
 AI


in
 in
 two
 different
 ways
 where
 on
 the


one
 side
 it's
 kind
 of
 where
 can
 we
 make


something
 more
 transformational
 and
 if


you
 look
 at
 our
 business


transformational
 is
 around
 I
 mean
 can
 we


use
 it
 to
 foster
 creativity
 or
 to
 at


least
 help
 our
 designers
 to
 spend
 even


more
 of
 their
 time
 on
 creativity.
 I


think
 that's
 something
 I
 can
 you
 imagine


an
 app
 that
 immediately
 uh
 build
 me
 a


Lego
 castle
 and
 it
 will
 give
 you
 a


proposal
 for
 how
 to
 do
 that
 and
 the


building
 instruction
 or
 whatever.
 Now


that's
 probably
 a
 little
 bit
 out
 but


could
 could
 we
 have
 ways
 of
 using
 our


technology
 to
 make
 designers
 more


effective.


>> We
 can
 code
 like
 everybody
 else.
 So
 the


the
 many
 software
 engineers
 we
 have
 they


can
 code
 faster.
 Those
 are
 things
 where


you
 can
 say
 here
 you
 get
 a
 real
 a
 real


big
 increase.
 The
 other
 one
 is
 really


day-to-day
 productivity
 for
 all
 of
 us.


And
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 we
 are
 we're
 probably


like
 many
 other
 companies
 in
 that
 that
 I


believe
 over
 time
 we
 need
 to
 see


productivity
 coming
 from
 that


>> and
 we're
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 do
 we


do
 that
 in
 the
 in
 the
 broader
 scale
 by


investing
 behind
 behind
 some
 of
 this.


We've
 been
 we've
 been
 we've
 been
 quite


focused
 on
 protecting
 our
 our
 data
 and


our
 information
 that
 that
 we
 don't
 have


models
 out
 there
 trained
 on
 legal
 on
 on


legal
 models
 or
 legal
 specific
 data.
 So


in
 that
 sense
 we've
 been
 uh
 we've
 been


trying
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 were
 well
 in


control
 of
 the
 kind
 of
 security
 and
 the


IP
 and
 trademark
 things
 around
 that


before
 we
 are
 now
 venturing
 into
 the


things
 I
 talked
 about.


>> Moving
 on
 to
 uh
 your
 leadership.
 How


would
 you
 describe
 your
 leadership


style?


>> I
 guess
 I'm
 somewhere
 and
 maybe
 that's


like
 that's
 a
 good
 mix
 of
 I'm
 I'm


somewhere
 on
 two
 sides.
 I'm
 an
 engineer


by
 training.
 So
 I
 uh
 I
 mean
 I
 used
 to
 in


invent
 stuff
 of
 technical
 nature.
 So
 I
 I


I
 have
 kind
 of
 the
 creative
 side
 to
 me


and
 and
 the
 and
 the
 uh
 I
 can
 get
 really


excited
 about
 that,
 but
 I
 also
 have
 this


kind
 of
 that
 it
 is
 not
 worth
 anything


unless
 it
 really
 gets
 to
 fruition
 in
 a


way
 and
 gets
 executed
 and
 and
 there's


processes
 behind
 and
 that.
 So
 I'm
 a


little
 bit
 of
 uh
 of
 both
 sides.
 I
 I
 I


like
 to
 I
 like
 to
 allow
 people
 the
 space


to
 both
 be
 creative
 but
 also
 to
 make


their
 own
 make
 their
 own
 decisions.
 So,


so
 as
 a
 leader
 I
 try
 to
 I
 try
 to
 be


quite
 clear
 on
 the
 on
 the
 guard
 rails
 or


the
 overall
 direction
 of
 what
 is
 we
 are


trying
 to
 achieve


>> uh
 in
 total
 so
 that
 there
 is
 a
 certain
 I


mean
 if
 there's
 good
 clarity
 on
 the


overall
 direction
 then
 more
 people
 or


more
 leaders
 within
 the
 organization


would
 feel
 comfortable
 making
 their
 own


decision
 because
 they
 know
 what
 we're


trying
 to
 achieve
 and
 I
 believe
 in
 that


decision
 power
 if
 it's
 there
 uh
 and
 and


I
 think
 it's
 only
 really
 there
 if
 the


frames
 are
 clear
 I
 Why
 why
 is


micromanagement
 so
 bad?


>> I
 guess
 the
 I
 guess
 when
 it's
 bad
 I


think
 it's
 that
 you
 use
 one
 brain


instead
 of
 many.


>> Um
 and
 uh
 but
 uh
 but
 of
 course
 if
 you


just
 and
 that's
 my
 point
 if
 you
 just


open
 up
 and
 say
 okay
 I
 I
 empower


everybody
 to
 do
 whatever
 they
 they
 want


to
 then
 I
 can
 guarantee
 you
 an


organization
 like
 this
 can
 run
 in
 a


million
 different
 directions
 because
 we


have
 so
 many
 creative
 people.
 So
 it's


kind
 of
 this
 how
 do
 you
 steer


>> creativity?
 How
 do
 you
 steer
 also


decision
 making
 from
 many
 in
 the


direction
 that
 you're
 trying
 to
 achieve


by
 having
 a
 very
 similar
 um
 line
 on


where
 you
 are?
 So
 I
 think
 I
 think
 the
 or


will
 see
 me
 as
 very
 involved
 in


strategic
 clarity
 and
 uh
 and
 what
 we
 do


very
 involved
 in
 making
 sure
 that
 the


operating
 model
 in
 the
 areas
 where
 we


cannot
 go
 in
 many
 different
 directions


is
 super
 super
 clear
 and
 that
 we


actually
 execute
 along
 it.
 while
 over


here
 on
 the
 creative
 side
 I
 mean
 every


Friday
 they
 can
 do
 whatever
 they
 want
 or


I
 mean
 there's
 just
 different
 things


different
 ways
 of
 doing
 that
 and


balancing
 that


I
 see
 that
 a
 lot
 as
 my
 role
 and
 I
 try
 to


provide
 that
 uh
 for
 the


>> so
 we
 are
 we
 are
 the
 same
 age
 right
 so


we
 are
 59
 do
 you
 think
 Neil's
 age
 30


would
 have
 uh
 recognized
 what
 you
 talk


about
 now
 or


>> no
 no


>> I
 I
 don't
 think
 so
 I
 think
 you
 I
 mean


>> so
 what
 could
 you
 talk
 talk
 about
 that


development


>> leadership
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 go
 back
 if
 I


look
 back
 at
 my
 career,
 I
 just
 have
 had


the
 privilege
 of
 being
 in
 in
 different


areas.
 I
 was
 um
 I
 was
 running
 a
 a


smaller
 company
 back
 around
 uh
 it
 was


probably
 around
 1999


20201.


We
 became
 the
 first
 company
 in
 the
 world


to
 launch
 a
 Bluetooth
 product.


>> Netcom
 netcom
 because
 we
 had
 worked
 with


Erikson
 back
 then
 on
 some
 wireless


technology.
 It
 failed
 back
 to
 our


discussion
 before
 and
 upon
 that
 failure


we
 sat
 down
 and
 figure
 out
 why
 and


Erikson
 actually
 went
 ahead
 from
 that


failure
 and
 defined
 the
 Bluetooth


protocol
 and
 said
 listen
 this
 is
 open


for
 everybody
 and
 then
 it
 was
 a
 race.
 We


were
 the
 first
 ones.
 So
 all
 of
 the
 if


you
 think
 back
 some
 of
 the
 mobile
 phones


that
 had
 a
 a
 headset
 that
 was
 without
 a


wire,
 I
 can
 almost
 guarantee
 that
 you


that
 was
 the
 likelihood
 was
 very
 high
 at


least
 that
 we
 did
 that.
 And
 so
 I
 was


really
 on
 the
 creative
 side
 and
 saw


that.
 But
 I
 also
 learned
 from
 that


journey
 of
 growing
 a
 company
 this
 fast.


I
 mean
 it
 was
 from
 it
 was
 from
 a
 billion


Danish
 kronel
 to
 three
 and
 a
 half


billion
 Danish
 krono
 in
 in
 in
 one
 or
 two


or
 three
 years
 and
 created
 some
 of
 the


problems
 on
 the
 executional
 side
 of


making
 it
 making
 it
 happen
 and
 making
 it


sustainable
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 that
 that


became
 difficult
 for
 the
 long
 term
 to


keep
 that
 position
 because
 it
 happened


so
 fast
 and
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of


competition
 and
 coming
 out
 of
 that
 then


I've
 had
 a
 long
 period
 uh
 with
 the
 I


mean
 at
 that
 point
 in
 time
 the
 biggest


industrial
 company
 in
 this
 country


called
 Danfos
 where
 it
 was
 um
 much
 more


down
 to
 really
 understanding
 where
 how


would
 you
 manufacture
 the
 right
 way.


Every
 single
 percentage
 of
 productivity


you
 could
 get
 out
 was
 a
 competitive


advantage
 on
 that
 and
 making
 sure
 how
 a


very
 complex
 or
 organization
 around
 the


world
 got
 very
 excellent
 in
 execution


around
 that
 stuff


>> and
 then
 my
 privilege
 is
 here
 I
 sit
 at


the
 Lego
 group
 and
 we
 are
 a
 beautiful


combination
 of
 those
 two
 things.
 What's


the
 best
 leadership
 advice
 you
 ever
 got?


>> I'm
 not
 sure
 I
 got
 it
 as
 an
 advice,
 but


I
 but
 I
 made
 a
 choice
 at
 one
 point
 to
 go


work
 for
 Netcom
 actually
 because
 I
 saw
 I


saw
 a
 a
 CEO
 there
 that
 that
 became
 my
 my


boss


>> that
 was
 uh
 quite
 different
 from
 myself.


I
 mean
 I'm
 analytical.
 I've
 been
 a


consultant
 early
 in
 my
 time.
 So
 I'm
 an


engineer.
 I
 went
 to
 business
 school.
 So


quite
 classical
 in
 many
 of
 those
 sense.


And
 he
 had
 this
 personal
 leadership


capability.
 he
 could
 create
 this
 pioneer


sense
 around
 something
 and
 and and


engage
 people
 and
 it
 was
 quite
 different


and
 we
 were
 in
 many
 ways
 not
 alike
 in


that
 but
 I
 learned
 a
 lot
 from
 him
 and


>> if
 you
 were
 to
 boil
 down
 what
 it
 was
 he


had
 what
 was
 it?


>> I
 think
 it
 was
 around
 how
 to
 lead
 people


in
 a
 direction
 without
 being
 necessarily


the
 the
 most
 uh
 without
 knowing
 the


substance
 the
 deepest.
 So,
 he
 was
 not
 a


technical
 person,
 but
 he
 knew
 how
 to


excite
 technical
 people
 and
 and
 allow


them
 this
 space
 to
 do
 that
 and
 and
 still


create
 this
 uh
 this
 feeling
 of
 of
 of


being
 together.
 That's
 uh
 it's
 it's
 very


hard
 to
 boil
 it
 down
 to
 exactly
 what
 it


is,
 but
 I
 tell
 you,
 I
 I I
 learned
 a
 lot


in
 the
 three
 years
 I
 had
 with
 him.


>> How
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 prioritize


the
 most
 important
 things?


>> Of
 course,
 it's
 got
 to
 be
 the
 most
 what


I
 think
 are
 the
 most
 important
 things.


So
 in
 that
 sense
 uh
 that
 could
 be
 right


or
 wrong
 but
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 process


of
 getting
 to
 that
 and
 and
 be
 clear


about
 that
 those
 things
 cannot
 be
 uh
 20


things
 they
 have
 to
 be
 fewer.
 I
 um
 I


spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 with
 my
 team
 on


making
 it's
 typically
 a
 four-year
 plan.


Uh
 and
 that
 four-year
 plan
 is
 quite


detailed
 and
 we
 are
 super
 aligned
 and
 we


continue
 until
 we
 are
 aligned
 in
 a
 way


that
 it's
 quite
 easy
 to
 to
 uh
 to


communicate
 these
 priorities
 that
 allows


in
 our
 situation
 a
 very
 good
 situation


over
 those
 four
 years
 to
 actually


execute
 up
 against
 that.


>> Why
 why
 four
 years?
 Normally
 I
 would


have
 thought
 three
 or
 five.
 Yeah,
 we


started
 out
 with
 three
 and
 if
 you
 do
 it


three,
 it
 feels
 like
 you're
 in
 it
 all


the
 time.
 If
 you
 do
 five,
 it
 feels
 like


the
 fifth
 year
 is
 so
 far
 out,
 you
 don't


know
 what
 happens.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 that


four
 is
 much
 better.
 But
 it
 turned
 out


that
 four
 works
 pretty
 well
 for
 us.
 It


also
 is
 like,
 you
 know,
 our
 product


development
 cycle.
 I
 mean,
 in
 a
 couple


of
 months,
 we
 will
 approve
 the
 2027


product
 portfolio.


>> So,
 it's
 a
 2-year
 horizon
 and
 four
 years


is
 allows
 us
 two
 roles
 if
 you
 want
 uh


within
 within
 a
 a
 period.
 Um,
 so
 4
 years


works
 well
 for
 us,
 but
 I
 think
 it
 has
 to


be
 long
 enough
 that
 you
 can
 start


initiatives
 and
 start
 to
 see
 some
 of
 the


results.
 It
 needs
 to
 be
 short
 enough


that
 it's
 not
 just
 a
 long-term
 vision.


Our
 long-term
 vision
 goes
 to
 2032


or
 even
 2039
 where
 our
 most
 active
 owner


turns
 60
 years
 old.
 So
 we
 think
 about


the
 brand,
 how
 should
 the
 brand
 look
 in


2039?
 How
 do
 we
 make
 sure
 it
 is
 as


strong
 as
 today?
 That's
 why
 we
 need
 to


get
 in
 digital
 stronger
 and
 stuff.
 So,


so
 we
 have
 different
 horizons,
 but
 the


four-year
 horizon
 is
 a
 pretty
 is
 a


pretty
 well
 thought
 through,
 very
 u
 also


operationalized
 horizon,
 and
 that's


probably
 why
 it
 shouldn't
 be
 too
 long.


>> Um,
 how
 do
 you
 prioritize
 your
 time?


Have
 you
 got
 any
 particular
 tricks?


>> Yeah,
 I
 am
 uh
 uh
 I
 often
 get
 told
 I
 have


the
 most
 structured
 calendar
 in
 this


country
 in
 that
 sense
 that
 we
 plan
 very


far
 ahead.
 So,
 I'm
 super
 structured
 from


a
 creative
 point
 of
 view,
 a
 creative


company
 point
 of
 view.
 So
 uh
 so
 all


meetings
 for
 26
 they
 sit
 we
 know
 exactly


in
 what
 cadence
 we
 have
 we
 have
 mod


meetings
 I
 um
 honestly
 Nikolai
 I
 don't


do
 this
 very
 often
 I
 spend
 most
 of
 my


time
 here
 I
 don't
 go
 a
 lot
 to


conferences
 I
 don't
 uh


>> No
 which
 is
 why
 we're
 honored
 to


>> No
 that
 was
 not
 why
 I'm
 saying
 it
 it's


just
 like
 I
 know
 I
 know
 you
 stay
 it's
 um


it's
 so
 I
 I
 am
 I'm
 very
 hard
 on


prioritizing
 what
 to
 do
 I'm
 also


internally
 very
 hard
 at
 prioritizing


what
 meetings
 I'm
 in


>> in
 that
 sense
 And
 and


>> how
 do
 you
 choose
 them?
 Um
 yeah,
 I
 I
 I


guess
 I
 choose
 them
 from
 from
 everything


it
 takes
 to
 create
 this
 surrounding
 we


just
 talked
 about
 whether
 the
 strategy


is
 clear
 or
 or
 I
 um
 I
 I
 mean
 if
 there's


an
 area
 that
 doesn't
 move
 or
 you
 know


sometimes
 in
 an
 organization
 there
 can


be
 churn
 that
 maybe
 there
 are


departments
 that
 are
 not
 exactly
 the
 the


same
 opinion
 of
 needs
 to
 happen
 and
 it


can
 just
 cycle
 in
 circles
 sometimes
 that


needs
 to
 be
 brought
 up


>> and
 kind
 of
 clarity
 created
 for
 one
 or


the
 other
 things.
 I
 try
 to
 spot
 those


when
 they're
 there
 and
 be
 part
 of
 that,


but
 I
 try
 to
 let
 my
 team
 and
 their
 teams


run
 with
 everything
 where
 I
 don't
 need


to
 be
 in.


>> How
 important
 is
 speed?


>> It
 is
 important.
 Uh
 it's
 um


I
 think
 it's
 quite
 important,
 but
 it's


kind
 of
 um
 sometimes
 we
 say
 it
 makes


sense
 to
 go
 slow
 to
 go
 fast.
 So
 speed


should
 not
 be
 misunderstood
 in
 the
 way


that
 you
 shouldn't
 plan
 right
 or
 you
 you


cannot
 build
 some
 structure
 behind
 it.


Uh
 but
 sometimes
 you
 just
 have
 to
 move


fast
 but
 sometimes
 in
 order
 for
 us
 to
 be


far
 four
 years
 from
 now
 maybe
 we
 should


be
 very
 very
 clear
 on
 what
 we
 what
 we


need
 to
 do.
 One
 of
 my
 learnings
 and


experiences
 over
 something
 if
 you
 just


jump
 into
 it
 and
 you
 just
 run
 if
 6


months
 later
 you
 sit
 with
 something
 that


doesn't
 really
 move
 then
 you
 haven't


accomplished


>> a
 lot.
 So,
 so
 it's
 not
 single
 mindly


speed,
 but
 but
 of
 course
 speed
 is


important.
 The
 world
 is
 moving
 really


fast.
 So,


>> I
 read
 this
 book
 last
 weekend
 and
 um
 uh


it
 talks
 about
 the
 research
 where
 they


figured
 out
 the
 difference
 between
 the


people
 who
 stand
 still
 on
 the
 moving


walkways


>> and
 the
 people
 who
 walk.


>> Yeah.


>> On
 the
 moving
 walkways.


>> So,
 if
 you
 stand
 still,
 you
 expect
 your


average
 lifetime
 to
 be
 74
 years.
 If
 you


walk,
 you
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 81.


If
 you
 walk,
 you
 are
 generally
 happier


and
 you're
 actually
 wealthier
 and
 you


have
 more
 sex.


>> It's
 interesting.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 I'm
 I'm
 just
 happy
 that
 I
 think
 I


always
 walk
 there.


>> No,
 that's
 uh


>> it's
 written
 by
 the
 new
 dean
 at
 the


Norwegian
 School
 of
 Economics.


>> But
 you
 know,
 it's
 also
 true
 that
 you


can
 have
 some
 I
 mean
 you
 can
 have
 the


best
 ideas
 in
 the
 world.


>> If
 you
 don't
 get
 them
 executed
 with
 some


speed,


>> they
 may
 not
 be
 worth
 anything.
 Which
 is


also
 why
 this,
 you
 know,
 your
 your


strategy,
 you
 can
 you
 can
 keep
 you
 can


keep
 honing
 your
 strategy
 until
 it's


100%.
 But
 sometimes
 it's
 better
 that
 you


execute
 something
 that
 is
 80%
 right
 with


with
 rigidously
 than
 you
 wait
 too
 long


and
 you
 try
 to
 optimize
 the
 last


percentage.


>> What's
 the
 key
 to
 execution
 power?
 Uh
 I


I
 think
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 clarity
 and


then
 and
 then
 uh
 I
 think
 just
 uh


can
 you
 say
 steadfast
 the
 way
 you
 even


as
 a
 CEO
 when
 it's
 not
 interesting
 you


keep
 asking
 to
 it
 and
 you
 keep
 making


sure
 that
 we're
 staying
 at
 it.
 Um
 and
 uh


you
 probably
 be
 surprised
 that
 uh
 that
 a


company
 like
 us
 that
 are
 very
 creative


we
 are
 quite
 we
 quite
 focused
 on
 getting


productivity
 out
 every
 year.
 We
 call
 it


partner
 for
 productivity.
 is
 a
 global


program
 and
 we
 crunch
 out
 significant


significant
 productivity
 and
 Danish


croner
 every
 year
 and
 uh
 and
 uh
 I
 think


everybody
 by
 now
 knows
 that
 productivity


is
 what's
 paying
 for
 all
 the
 super


exciting
 things
 we
 can
 do
 over
 and
 above


>> and
 without
 this
 not
 that
 and
 that
 is
 uh


that's
 difficult
 and
 that's
 something


that
 uh
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 that
 that
 that


you're
 very
 clear
 and
 you
 stay
 on


I
 think
 that's
 important
 for
 the
 um
 uh


for
 the
 um
 execution
 part.
 The
 other
 one


is
 of
 course
 the
 clarity.
 I
 mean
 we
 have


an
 operating
 model
 in
 the
 factory
 that


you've
 had
 an
 opportunity
 to
 see
 to
 see


today.
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 we
 have
 we
 have


six
 factories
 right
 now
 around
 the


globe.
 They
 look
 exactly
 the
 same.
 They


operate
 exactly
 the
 same.
 So
 you
 can


take
 an
 operator
 from
 here
 and
 bring
 the


person
 to
 Czech
 Republic
 or
 Vietnam
 and


they
 can
 work
 there
 tomorrow.
 And
 that


kind
 of
 rigidity
 in
 I
 think
 that
 gives


you
 executional
 power
 as
 well
 that
 there


is
 very
 little
 doubt
 about
 what
 to
 do
 or


there's
 very
 little
 freedom
 to
 change


that
 process


>> uh
 tomorrow
 and
 that
 that's
 what
 we
 have


on
 this
 side
 of
 the
 picture.


>> What
 about
 simplicity?
 How
 important
 is


it
 to
 make
 things
 simple?


>> I
 mean
 I
 have
 this
 you
 know


maybe


>> because
 you
 simplified
 things
 quite
 a


bit
 when
 you
 took
 over
 here.
 It's
 a
 it's


it's
 a
 little
 have
 an
 anecdote
 from
 when


I
 started
 you
 know
 when
 um
 I
 mean
 I
 was


also
 super
 humble
 coming
 into
 the
 Lego


company
 this
 brand
 and
 how
 can
 you
 how


can
 you
 do
 that
 and
 I
 came
 in
 and
 I
 I
 I


think
 before
 arriving
 here
 this
 is
 now


almost
 8
 years
 ago
 and
 uh
 before


arriving
 here
 I
 thought
 I
 had
 ideas
 to


what
 would
 it
 be
 and
 what
 should
 change


and
 a
 month
 into
 being
 here
 I
 stood
 in


the
 town
 hall
 and
 I
 literally
 talked


about
 us
 having
 too
 many
 meetings
 too


many
 people
 in
 the
 meetings
 too
 uh
 too


many
 meetings
 before
 there
 was
 a


decision
 I
 mean
 things
 that
 you
 would


say
 ah
 is
 that
 now
 the
 most
 important


thing
 a
 new
 CEO
 can
 bring
 to
 a
 company


but
 I
 think
 it
 was
 just
 super
 super


important
 for
 us
 and
 I
 I'm
 I'm
 pushing


this
 now
 that
 we
 um
 I
 mean
 normally
 a


leadership
 team
 would
 be
 sitting
 and


they
 would
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 on
 their


agenda
 they
 would
 meet
 every
 month
 in


dayong
 meetings
 and
 stuff
 like
 that
 and


we've
 changed
 that
 we've
 kind
 of
 created


subgroups
 of
 even
 I
 leadership
 team
 that


we
 delegate
 we
 have
 now
 what we
 call


commercial
 triangle
 it's
 the
 it's
 the


chief
 commercial
 officer
 the
 chief


operating
 officer
 and
 the
 chief


marketing
 officer
 there
 together
 they


are
 we've
 delegated
 to
 them
 to
 make
 all


the
 decisions
 to
 make
 the
 the
 wheel
 go


every
 day
 on
 that
 and
 only
 if
 they


totally
 disagree
 or
 they
 don't
 know
 what


to
 do
 they
 can
 escalate
 that
 goes
 down


on
 all
 levels
 it
 actually
 means
 that
 we


as
 a
 leadership
 team
 we
 meet
 one
 hour
 or


one
 and
 a
 half
 hour
 every
 month
 and
 then


four
 times
 a
 year
 for
 3
 days
 that's
 it.


The
 rest
 is
 being
 done
 in
 smaller
 teams


and
 that
 has
 gone
 to
 the
 next
 level
 and


they
 have
 they
 have
 also
 delegated
 in


that
 sense.
 Now
 of
 course
 it
 means
 that


you
 need
 to
 keep
 each
 other
 informed.
 It


also
 means
 that
 they
 have
 to
 be
 pretty


clear
 on
 overall
 what
 are
 we
 trying
 to


move
 up
 against?
 But
 if
 you
 can
 simplify


that
 and
 have
 many
 or
 have
 fewer
 people


involved
 in
 everything
 and
 more
 clarity


around
 it,
 then
 you
 you
 just
 gain
 speed


>> and
 you
 gain
 decision
 power
 throughout


and
 uh
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 you
 have


more
 satisfied
 uh
 employees
 that
 spend


more
 of
 the
 time
 delivering
 value
 and


less
 time
 just
 uh
 negotiating
 with


ourselves.


>> Many
 companies
 lose
 speed
 and
 become


slower
 and
 lazier,
 which
 is
 why
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 don't
 uh
 survive
 in
 the
 long


term.
 How
 do
 you
 avoid
 LIGO
 uh
 becoming


lazy
 and
 complacent?


>> I
 think
 we
 had
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 wakeup


call
 in
 in
 in
 201617
 because
 I
 think
 it


was
 exactly
 some
 of
 what
 some
 of
 what


happened.
 So
 I
 think
 this
 uh
 the


constant
 the
 constant
 push
 on


productivity
 and
 um
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 the


push
 on
 relevance.
 I
 think
 those
 are
 the


two
 things
 I
 would
 mention
 that
 we
 we


focus
 on.
 we
 need
 to
 stay
 relevant


>> uh
 and
 uh
 if
 we
 need
 to
 change
 things
 or


do
 things
 to
 stay
 relevant
 then
 we'll
 do


it
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 making
 sure
 that


just
 because
 we
 are
 successful
 and
 make


a
 lot
 of
 money
 it's
 actually
 a
 big


danger
 because
 you
 can
 easily
 get
 yeah


get
 complacent
 or
 getting
 too
 efficient


in
 all
 your
 processes
 and
 having
 too


many
 people
 involved
 in
 everything
 and


that's
 something
 we
 need
 to
 actively


fight
 because
 with
 with
 values
 like
 we


have
 of
 being
 caring
 and
 collaborative


uh
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 I
 mean
 why
 would
 I


not
 invite
 another
 10
 people
 into
 the


meetings
 So
 they
 also
 know
 about
 it
 and


it's
 uh
 and
 then
 they
 feel
 good
 about


that.
 That's
 um
 that's
 not
 what
 we
 want


and
 uh
 and
 what
 so
 I
 think
 as
 a


leadership
 team
 we
 constantly
 need
 to


work
 that
 there
 is
 just
 an
 inertia
 that


want
 to
 make
 that
 happen
 and
 we
 need
 to


stay
 out
 of
 that.


>> Do
 you
 think
 it's
 a
 danger
 in
 uh


Scandinavia
 where
 everything
 has
 to
 be


uh
 you
 know
 consensus
 driven
 anchored


everywhere
 uh
 everybody
 should
 feel


included
 you're
 a
 rich
 company.


>> Yes.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 bigger
 danger.
 I
 do.


I
 do.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 exactly
 a
 bigger


thing.


>> Yeah.
 Now,
 how
 do
 you
 um
 how
 do
 you


relax?


>> I
 uh
 I've
 started
 to
 play
 golf
 and
 and
 I


thought
 that
 would
 be
 relaxing,
 but
 it's


not
 when
 I'm
 out
 there.
 But
 it's


different


>> because
 you're
 too
 competitive.


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 too
 competitive
 when
 I'm


there.
 Yeah.
 Which
 is
 annoying.
 I
 I've


always
 relaxed
 a
 lot.
 I,
 you
 know,


working
 uh
 uh
 working
 as
 a
 CEO,
 you


know,
 we
 all
 put
 in
 many
 hours
 and
 uh


and
 I've
 I've
 typically
 spend
 a
 lot
 of


my
 free
 time
 with
 my
 family
 at
 my
 kids.


So,
 I
 did
 not
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 other


things.
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 jump
 on
 a
 bicycle
 uh


Saturday
 morning
 and
 then
 I
 return
 at
 uh


mid-after
 afternoon.
 I
 just
 don't
 do


that.
 So,
 so
 I
 I
 am
 I'm
 pretty
 good
 at


uh
 relaxing.
 I
 want
 to
 be
 outside
 now.


Uh
 and
 now
 playing
 golf.
 I'm
 with
 my


family.
 So
 I'm
 you
 can
 say
 it's
 it's


boring
 but
 I
 I
 don't
 have
 three
 sports


that
 I
 pull
 pull
 off
 at
 those.
 I
 I


practice
 but
 only
 only
 to
 keep
 fit.


>> Do
 you
 read
 what
 do
 you
 read?


>> Um
 yeah
 I
 like
 reading
 stuff
 like
 uh


yeah
 Ken
 Flet
 or
 Danish
 Life
 Davis.
 I
 I


like
 things
 that
 are
 a
 good
 story
 that


that
 is
 also
 realistic
 in
 a
 way
 that


gets
 me
 thinking
 differently.


>> Now
 I
 put
 a
 big
 bucket
 of
 uh
 Lego
 bricks


in
 front
 of
 you.
 What
 would
 you
 build?


there
 there's
 a
 high
 likelihood
 I
 would


build
 a
 vehicle
 of
 some
 kind
 uh
 a
 car
 or


a
 fantasy
 uh
 thing
 or
 a
 combination
 of
 a


car
 and
 airplane
 or
 whatever.
 But
 I


think
 that
 would
 be
 it
 cuz
 you
 like
 to


move
 and
 you
 like
 speed.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 like
 vehicles.
 I
 like
 cars.


So


>> um
 last
 question.
 We
 got
 lots
 of
 um


young
 listeners.
 What's
 the
 best
 advice


you
 can
 give
 them?
 Uh
 now
 I
 think
 if
 you


if
 you
 think
 over
 time
 the
 way
 as
 um
 the


way
 we
 develop
 as
 people
 I
 believe
 is
 by


getting
 a
 challenge
 that's
 exactly
 big


enough
 that
 it
 we
 need
 to
 develop
 but


that's
 not
 bigger
 than
 we
 uh
 that
 we


won't
 we
 won't
 fail
 so
 miserably
 that
 we


lose
 uh
 confidence.
 So,
 so
 I
 so
 I
 think


for
 that
 sense
 it's
 around
 following


following
 the
 interest
 or
 passions
 and


and
 uh
 and
 and
 trying
 to
 trying
 to
 look


for
 the
 next
 exciting
 opportunity
 or


challenge
 within
 that
 and
 trying
 it
 out


and
 and
 learning
 from
 that.
 Uh
 you
 know


I
 think
 we
 are
 I
 think
 we're
 better


versions
 of
 of
 ourselves
 if
 we
 work
 with


something
 that
 we
 are
 fundamentally


interested
 in.


>> Uh
 doing
 that
 you
 tend
 to
 perform


better.
 You
 may
 be
 offered
 the
 the
 next


challenge
 you
 can
 go
 on
 that.
 I
 think
 I


think
 that's
 uh
 that's
 the
 um
 that's
 the


way
 to
 go
 and
 and
 and
 really
 um
 if
 we


are
 also
 putting
 on
 now
 more
 like
 of


career
 lens
 too
 how
 do
 you
 uh
 what
 would


you
 do
 then
 I
 would
 say
 make
 sure
 you


try
 you
 try
 different
 things
 it's
 not
 a


it's
 not
 a
 race
 in
 that
 sense
 I
 think


few
 few
 people
 that
 end
 up
 being
 CEOs


just
 had
 a
 straight
 line
 there
 I
 mean


there
 are
 opportunities
 on
 the
 way
 that


if
 you
 grab


uh
 they
 would
 be
 interesting
 and
 it's


never
 a
 straight
 line
 in
 that
 sense.
 It


wasn't
 for
 me.
 I
 didn't
 plan
 it.
 Uh
 but


I
 uh
 I
 I
 jumped
 on
 some
 things
 that
 I


thought
 was
 super
 interesting
 that


fitted
 what
 I
 needed
 to
 do.
 And
 I
 think


that
 uh
 so
 that's
 what
 that's
 what
 I


would
 do.
 Being
 a
 little
 bit
 more


relaxed
 on
 the
 career
 planning,
 but


being
 uh
 being
 more
 focused
 on
 what
 what


is
 exciting
 and
 then
 I
 think
 it
 will


come.


>> Now
 you
 mentioned
 uh
 um


being
 a
 better
 version
 of
 yourself.
 I


think
 Lego
 has
 made
 uh
