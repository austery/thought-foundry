Israel
 and
 Hamas
 have
 agreed
 to
 a


ceasefire
 deal
 that
 would
 bring
 relief


to
 Gaza
 after
 2
 years
 of
 fighting.
 Under


the
 terms
 of
 the
 agreement,
 Hamas
 will


return
 all
 of
 the
 hostages
 still
 in


Gaza,
 and
 Israel
 will
 release
 some


Palestinian
 prisoners
 and
 partially


withdraw
 its
 troops
 from
 Gaza
 City.


The
 deal
 was
 announced
 after
 days
 of


negotiations
 between
 Israel
 and
 Hamas
 in


Egypt
 and
 builds
 on
 a
 20point
 peace
 plan


for
 the
 region
 released
 by
 US
 President


Donald
 Trump
 last
 month.


>> If
 Hamas
 rejects
 the
 deal,
 which
 is


always
 possible,
 they're
 the
 only
 one


left.
 Everyone
 else
 has
 accepted
 it,
 but


uh
 I
 have
 a
 feeling
 that
 we're
 going
 to


have
 a
 positive
 answer.
 But
 if
 not,
 as


you
 know,
 baby,
 you'd
 have
 more
 full


backing
 to
 do
 what
 you


>> The
 Israeli
 cabinet
 was
 meeting
 to


approve
 the
 deal
 Thursday
 night,
 but


negotiations
 about
 what
 comes
 next
 are


set
 to
 continue
 in
 the
 coming
 days,
 and


it's
 still
 unclear
 whether
 the
 ceasefire


will
 lead
 to
 a
 lasting
 peace.


More
 than
 67,000
 people
 in
 Gaza
 have


been
 killed,
 20,000
 of
 whom
 are


children,
 according
 to
 the
 Hamasun


Health
 Authority.
 and
 a
 UN
 backed
 body


declared
 famine
 in
 Gaza
 in
 August.
 Of


the
 250
 hostages
 Hamas
 took
 in
 its


October
 7th
 attack,
 48
 were
 still
 being


held
 and
 20
 are
 believed
 to
 be
 alive.


For
 the
 average
 person,
 it
 is
 a
 day
 of


cautious
 optimism
 about
 what
 the
 future


may
 hold.
 Relief
 that
 this
 devastating


two-year
 war
 may
 be
 coming
 to
 an
 end,


but
 also
 I
 would
 say
 a
 day
 of
 solemnness


because
 there
 has
 been
 so
 much


destruction
 inflicted
 in
 the
 last
 couple


of
 years.


>> Jamanna
 Bureti
 is
 Bloomberg
 TV's
 Middle


East
 correspondent.


So
 many
 people
 have
 died.
 You're
 talking


about
 90%
 of
 the
 strip
 being


uninhabitable
 at
 this
 point.
 So
 there


are
 still
 lots
 of
 questions
 about
 what


happens
 in
 the
 day
 after.
 And
 ultimately


the
 bigger
 question
 for
 all
 of
 this
 is


about
 whether
 these
 two
 potentially


future
 states
 can
 actually
 coexist
 and


live
 side
 by
 side.

 this
 is

 big


take

 Aviv


to
 discuss
 how
 this
 deal
 between
 Israel


and
 Hamas
 was
 brokered,
 what
 makes
 it


different
 from
 past
 agreements,
 and


whether
 it
 could
 set
 the
 stage
 for
 a


permanent
 ceasefire.

Jima
 Berseti
 Ferz
 Al
 Ghoul
 Galit
 Alstein


thank
 you
 for
 being
 here
 we're
 talking


on
 Thursday
 afternoon
 in
 New
 York


Thursday
 night
 in
 Israel
 and
 Gaza
 Jima


walk
 us
 through
 the
 highlevel
 terms
 of


this
 agreement


>> President
 Trump
 put
 up
 a
 post
 on
 Truth


Social
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 night
 around


2
 a.m.
 local
 saying
 that
 both
 Israel
 and


Hamas
 had
 agreed
 to
 phase
 one
 of
 the


peace
 deal
 and
 on
 the
 back
 of
 that
 that


would
 secure
 the
 release
 of
 the


hostages.
 48
 of
 them
 in
 total,
 20
 of


them
 thought
 to
 still
 be
 alive
 in


exchange
 for
 about
 2,000
 Palestinian


prisoners
 and
 detaininees.
 Now,


alongside
 that,
 Israel,
 per
 phase
 one
 of


the
 agreement,
 would
 agree
 to
 withdraw


to
 a
 pre-agreed
 line
 known
 as
 the
 yellow


line
 per
 the
 peace
 plan
 that
 would
 still


keep
 Israel
 in
 control
 of
 around
 53%
 of


the
 Gaza
 Strip.
 Alongside
 that,
 it
 would


also
 facilitate
 the
 passage
 of


humanitarian
 aid,
 much
 needed
 within
 the


Gaza
 Strip.
 So,
 a
 huge
 step
 from
 a


diplomatic
 standpoint,
 but
 again,
 still


just
 phase
 one
 of
 this
 20point
 plan.
 And


at
 this
 point,
 there
 was
 no
 reference


about
 some
 of the
 longerterm
 questions


that
 still
 are
 outstanding
 visav


governance,
 full
 Hamas
 disarmament,
 the


extent
 of
 IDF
 withdrawal.
 The
 first


phase
 of
 the
 plan
 aligns
 with
 Trump's


vision
 by
 securing
 the
 release
 of
 the


Israeli
 hostages
 who
 are
 alive.
 Hamas
 in


the
 past
 had
 refused
 to
 discuss
 this


possibility
 or
 option
 of
 releasing
 all


the
 living
 Israeli
 hostages.
 But
 this


time
 it
 is
 different.
 This
 time
 Trump's


plans
 enjoy
 backing
 and
 support
 from
 the


world
 including
 the
 Arab
 and
 Muslim


countries.
 particularly
 including
 Qatar


and
 Turkey.
 Those
 are
 the
 two
 countries


that
 have
 a
 good
 relationship
 with
 Hamas


and
 where
 Hamas
 leaders
 usually
 stay.


This
 was
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 why
 Hamas


came
 to
 agree
 on
 this.
 And
 let's
 not


forget
 the
 timing
 and
 the
 situation
 in


which
 the
 plan
 was
 presented.
 It
 comes


as
 Israel
 went
 ahead
 in
 its
 plan
 to
 take


over
 the
 Gaza
 city
 which
 is
 the
 main


stronghold
 of
 Hamas.
 After
 2
 years
 of


war,
 Hamas
 has
 been
 losing
 on
 a
 daily


basis
 in
 terms
 of
 manpower
 and
 weapons.


So,
 it
 was
 being
 weakened.
 Also,
 let's


not
 forget
 that
 Hamas
 in
 the
 south
 of


Gaza
 Strip
 where
 most
 of
 the
 displaced


people
 are
 staying
 there.
 Hamas
 had


faced
 increasing
 challenge
 from
 militias


and
 armed
 groups
 that
 are
 backed
 by


Israel
 as
 well
 as
 clans.
 For
 the
 past


two
 weeks,
 Hamas
 had
 been
 fighting
 with


some
 clans
 in
 the
 south
 of
 Gaza
 Strip


and
 this
 adds
 more
 pressure
 into
 Hamas


>> and
 Gal.
 You
 know,
 there
 have
 been
 other


ceasefires
 brokered
 and
 broken
 over
 the


course
 of
 this
 war.
 Are
 there
 signs
 that


this
 agreement
 and
 this
 ceasefire
 is


different?


>> Um,
 yes.
 I
 would
 say
 that
 that
 there


are.
 First
 and
 foremost,
 in
 this
 case,


Israel
 is
 getting
 all
 the
 hostages
 back,


both
 the
 living
 and
 dead
 hostages,
 and


that's
 a
 very
 big
 deal,
 and
 that
 wasn't


made
 possible
 until
 this
 deal
 came


through.
 I
 think
 that
 also
 there's
 never


been
 an
 agreement
 to
 a
 comprehensive


deal
 that
 we
 still
 need
 to
 see
 um
 if
 can


be
 realized
 fully.
 And
 at
 the
 same
 time,


there's
 always
 been
 talk
 of
 partial


deals,
 temporary
 ceasefires,
 and
 this


time,
 what's
 different
 is
 the
 fact
 that


all
 the
 hostages
 are
 coming
 back
 right


away,
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 there
 is
 a
 sort


of
 horizon,
 even
 if
 it's
 not
 100%
 clear


on
 what
 the
 next
 steps
 are
 supposed
 to


be.


>> Galit,
 at
 this
 point
 in
 the
 war
 on
 Gaza,


Israel
 has
 become
 increasingly
 isolated


on
 the
 global
 stage.
 Its
 economy
 has


been
 damaged.
 What
 kinds
 of
 pressures


has
 Israel
 been
 under
 to
 end
 this
 war?


And
 what
 does
 this
 agreement
 say
 about


Israel's
 position?


>> So,
 this
 is
 um
 Israel's
 longest
 and
 most


expensive
 war
 in
 its
 history.
 The
 costs


have
 many
 faces.
 I
 mean,
 one
 very
 major


factor
 in
 the
 costs
 of
 this
 war
 has
 been


the
 extensive
 use
 of
 reserve
 forces.
 Um


so
 so
 this
 has
 been
 a
 very
 big
 um
 burden


on
 government
 finances
 and
 to
 afford


this
 usage
 of
 reserve
 forces
 and
 also


other
 military
 expenditure.
 Israel
 has


had
 to
 um
 raise
 a
 lot
 of
 debt
 over
 the


last
 two
 years.
 Last
 year
 we
 saw
 a


record-breaking
 borrowing
 spree
 that
 the


Israeli
 government
 went
 on.
 Now,
 while


Israel
 still
 has
 pretty
 good
 access
 to


international
 markets
 and
 has
 very
 deep


pocketed
 local
 um
 market,
 the
 costs
 are


pretty
 high
 as
 this
 adds
 up,
 not
 just


now,
 but
 obviously
 also
 moving
 forward.


Another
 thing
 that's
 been
 impacted,
 and


this
 is
 all
 obviously
 connected,
 is
 um


Israel's
 growth
 rate.
 So,
 Israel
 has


been
 slumping
 in
 its
 growth
 rate
 for
 the


last
 two
 years,
 and
 this
 year
 doesn't


look
 very
 promising
 either
 at
 this


stage.
 So
 there's
 we're
 seeing
 a
 sort
 of


contraction
 of
 the
 economy.
 Um
 we're


seeing
 a
 drop
 in
 GDP
 per
 capita.
 I
 will


also
 say
 that
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 Israeli


population
 in
 comparison
 to
 what
 they


were
 used
 to
 before
 the
 war,
 it's
 been
 a


big
 change.
 Um
 there
 were
 many
 new
 taxes


that
 were
 imposed.
 There
 were
 many


cutbacks
 on
 social
 services
 on
 civilian


expenditure
 by
 the
 government.
 So


everyone
 is
 feeling
 a
 difference
 in


their
 standard
 of
 living
 now
 versus
 what


they
 were
 used
 to
 before
 the
 war.


>> How
 much
 is
 this
 an
 economic
 question


versus
 one
 of
 international
 pressure
 to


stop
 this
 war?


>> So
 I
 think
 um
 the
 international
 pressure


and
 the
 economic
 pressure
 are
 in
 a
 way


connected.
 The
 Europeans
 were


threatening
 to
 sanction
 Israel


economically
 and
 that
 was
 a
 pretty


serious
 threat
 if
 it
 were
 to
 be
 carried


out.
 And
 I
 can
 also
 tell
 you
 that
 in


terms
 of
 local
 businesses
 who
 rely
 on


exports
 to
 Europe
 and
 elsewhere
 there


there
 was
 very
 much
 a
 growing
 concern


that
 even
 if
 countries
 or
 governments


haven't
 yet
 sanctioned
 Israel
 in
 Europe


for
 example
 then
 private
 companies
 were


reluctant
 or
 were
 starting
 to
 be


reluctant
 to
 do
 business
 with
 Israel.
 So


to
 that
 end
 I
 would
 say
 that
 it
 was
 more


about
 you
 know
 international
 pressure


and
 Trump
 putting
 all
 his
 weight
 behind


this
 proposal
 but
 it
 wasn't
 disconnected


from
 economic
 pressures
 mainly
 from


Europe.


>> We
 talk
 about
 you
 know
 war
 fatigue
 about


the
 economic
 pressures
 about
 the


pressures
 coming
 through
 from
 the


international
 community
 with
 so
 many


nations
 around
 the
 world
 just
 a
 couple


of
 weeks
 ago
 pushing
 for
 Palestinian


statethood.
 But
 I
 would
 also
 add
 one


more
 thing
 which
 is
 the
 last
 time
 the


ceasefire
 elapsed
 in
 March
 of
 this
 year,


the
 situation
 politically
 in
 the
 region


for
 Israel
 was
 different.
 And
 since
 then


what
 you
 have
 seen
 is
 a
 war
 with
 Iran


that
 has
 diminished
 the
 capabilities
 of


the
 Iranian
 regime.
 Probably
 not


administered
 the
 fatal
 knockout
 that


President
 Trump
 has
 said
 it
 has.
 But


ultimately
 what
 you
 have
 seen
 is
 a
 a


severe
 diminishment
 of
 what
 their


military
 capabilities
 uh
 can
 offer.


You've
 also
 seen
 a
 similar
 kind
 of


dismantling
 of
 Hezbollah
 as
 an
 entity
 in


Lebanon
 and
 uh
 the
 installation
 of
 a


Lebanese
 government
 that's
 more
 pro-


West
 and
 more
 pro-
 US.
 And
 of
 course,


you've
 seen
 the
 deterioration
 of
 Hamas


and
 their
 own
 capabilities
 in
 addition


to
 a
 lot
 of
 pressure
 from
 the
 US


administration
 to
 control
 the
 Houthis.


And
 so,
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it
 from
 a


regional
 perspective,
 Israel
 has
 managed


to
 inflict
 quite
 heavy
 blows
 on
 some
 of


their
 regional
 adversaries
 as
 well.


>> Coming
 up,
 as
 negotiations
 continue,


what
 it
 would
 take
 to
 broker
 lasting


peace.


[Music]


Thursday's
 ceasefire
 deal
 between
 Israel


and
 Hamas
 follows
 2
 years
 of
 war
 in


Gaza.
 Past
 attempts
 to
 broker
 peace
 and


pause
 fighting
 have
 failed
 to
 hold
 long


term.
 But
 international
 pressure


combined
 with
 the
 mounting
 humanitarian


and
 economic
 toll
 of
 the
 war
 have


brought
 Israel
 and
 Hamas
 to
 a
 point


where
 they
 could
 agree
 to
 the
 first


steps
 of
 a
 more
 comprehensive
 agreement.


I
 asked
 Jumanna
 Bersi
 who
 covers
 the


Middle
 East
 for
 Bloomberg
 about
 the
 key


turning
 points
 that
 led
 to
 these


negotiations.
 I
 think
 what's
 become


apparent
 from
 this
 process
 and
 this


isn't
 a
 surprise
 to
 anyone
 but
 President


Trump
 is
 transactional
 by
 nature
 and


earlier
 on
 on
 Bloomberg
 television
 uh


one
 of
 our
 colleagues
 was
 speaking
 to


the
 deputy
 foreign
 minister
 and
 was


asked
 about
 President
 Trump's
 role
 in


the
 process
 and
 was
 given
 a
 lot
 of


credit
 for
 it
 and
 she
 actually
 said
 he


is
 focused
 on
 the
 endgame
 he's
 less


focused
 on
 the
 means
 of
 getting
 there


i.e.
 he
 is
 transactional.
 He
 wanted
 to


get
 to
 this
 end
 result.
 I
 think
 what


became
 apparent
 from
 all
 of
 this
 is
 also


the
 state
 of
 the
 relationship
 that


President
 Trump
 enjoys
 with
 some
 of
 his


Arab
 Gulf
 allies
 as
 well.
 If
 you
 look


back
 at
 the
 last
 couple
 of
 weeks,
 things


really
 started
 to
 increase
 the
 momentum.


There
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 drive
 and
 focus
 out


of
 the
 US
 administration
 after
 the
 DHA


attack
 that
 took
 place.
 Um
 this
 was
 an


attack
 that
 Israel
 ministers
 they
 were


targeting
 Hamas
 officials
 on
 Dha
 but


also
 unprecedented
 in
 nature.
 Uh
 and
 at


the
 time
 Qatar
 was
 iate
 about
 the


infringement
 of
 its
 sovereignty
 and


reportedly
 at
 the
 time
 as
 well
 President


Trump
 was
 also
 very
 angry
 that
 Israel


had
 gone
 this
 far
 and
 taken
 this
 step.


The
 perception
 from
 the
 administration


was
 that
 perhaps
 in
 this
 case
 Israel
 had


overreached.
 And
 so
 what
 you've
 seen


since
 then
 is
 a
 massive
 diplomatic


effort
 out
 of
 Qatar
 and
 other
 Arab


states
 in
 the
 region
 to
 get
 in
 Trump's


ear.
 I
 think
 one
 big
 difference
 this


time
 around
 is
 you
 do
 have
 a
 lot
 of


buyin
 from
 these
 key
 Arab
 states,
 from


the
 key
 mediators,
 from
 the
 likes
 of


Qatar.
 They've
 thrown
 their
 weight
 and


their
 support
 behind
 this
 plan
 and
 they


helped
 put
 the
 plan
 together
 the
 week
 of


the
 UN
 General
 Assembly.
 Well,
 one
 key


point
 in
 Trump's
 plan
 is
 that
 Hamas


hands
 over
 control
 and
 administration
 of


the
 Gaza
 Strip
 to
 another
 entity.


Ferris,
 do
 you
 get
 the
 sense
 that
 they


are
 willing
 to
 do
 that?


>> Hamas
 said
 they
 are
 looking
 for


intraparestinian


talks
 or
 dialogue
 to
 be
 held
 in
 Cairo
 to


discuss
 the
 future
 of
 Gaza.
 In
 the
 past


and
 currently,
 Hamas
 has
 always
 said


that
 they
 are
 ready
 to
 relinquish
 power.


But
 one
 of
 their
 analysts
 said
 that


while
 Hamas
 will
 not
 be
 directly
 in
 the


government,
 it
 cannot
 leave
 the
 entire


Palestinian
 scene
 or
 arena.
 And
 the


sticking
 point
 is
 the
 issue
 of
 Hamas


weapons,
 the
 disarming
 and
 uh
 the


departure
 of
 its
 of
 some
 of
 its
 leaders


or
 or
 officials
 or
 members
 from
 the
 Gaza


Strip.
 But
 I
 think
 talking
 about
 this


issue
 will
 be
 less
 intense
 or
 easier


when
 there
 is
 no
 fighting
 for
 the


Palestinian
 people
 and
 for
 Hamas.
 The


most
 important
 thing
 is
 that
 the
 daily


bloodshed
 or
 or
 and
 fighting
 and
 attacks


stop.
 I
 talked
 to
 people
 after
 the


ceasefire.
 Many
 of
 them
 say
 regardless


the
 terms
 and
 conditions,
 the
 most


important
 thing
 we
 want
 to
 see
 is
 that


the
 war
 stops,
 the
 attacks
 stops,
 the


aid
 gets
 in,
 and
 we
 can
 return
 to
 what


is
 left
 of
 our
 houses.
 Many
 Palestinians


have
 been
 upset
 and
 angry
 at
 Hamas
 and


this
 sentiment
 has
 increased
 during
 the


war.
 I
 spoke
 to
 some
 of
 them
 who
 were


agreeing
 that
 Hamasia
 needs
 to
 depart


and
 needs
 to
 step
 down
 having
 been


controlling
 Gaza
 for
 more
 than
 18
 years


since
 2007.


Hamas
 itself
 says
 we
 are
 giving
 up


control,
 giving
 up
 ruling.
 But
 the


question
 is
 to
 what
 extent
 Hamas
 is


ready
 to
 give
 up.
 Are
 they
 just
 going
 to


stay
 out
 of
 whatever
 body
 that
 will
 run


the
 day-to-day
 affairs
 in
 Gaza
 and


control
 from
 behind
 the
 scene
 or
 will


they
 act
 as
 a
 shadow
 government?
 So
 I


think
 uh
 the
 all
 of
 these
 issues
 need
 to


be
 tackled
 in
 the
 upcoming
 rounds
 of


talks
 and
 those
 talks
 will
 not
 be
 easy.


Uh
 the
 chances
 of
 their
 success
 is
 less


than
 the
 chances
 of
 their
 failure.


>> And
 Kal,
 I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 something


you
 said
 earlier
 that
 this
 agreement
 is


different
 because
 it's
 comprehensive.


It's
 not
 partial.
 It's
 not
 temporary.
 It


is
 a
 comprehensive
 ceasefire
 agreement.


What
 signs
 are
 you
 seeing
 from
 the


Israeli
 government
 about
 whether
 the


ceasefire
 will
 hold?
 I
 think
 that
 the


general
 thinking
 and
 the
 general
 sense


is
 that
 given
 how
 invested
 both
 US


President
 Trump
 is
 in
 this
 plan
 as
 well


as
 regional
 players,
 I
 think
 that
 that


first
 and
 foremost
 gives
 a
 sense
 that


this
 time
 Israel
 will
 not
 be
 at
 liberty


so
 to
 speak
 to
 decide
 solely
 on
 its
 own


that
 for
 example
 it
 wants
 to
 go
 back
 to


fighting.
 it
 will
 kind
 of
 need
 to
 be


more
 coordinated
 with
 the
 US.
 And
 while


in
 the
 past
 the
 US
 has
 backed
 um
 Israel


um
 asking
 to
 finish
 the
 job
 in
 Gaza
 to


defeat
 Kamas
 as
 they
 called
 it,
 that


could
 turn
 out
 to
 be
 more
 complicated


this
 time
 around.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 I


would
 say
 that
 things


are
 a
 bit
 vague
 on
 on
 what
 happens
 next.


And
 you
 know,
 Israeli
 officials
 have


said
 both
 on
 and
 off
 the
 record
 that
 um


if
 Hamas
 refuses
 to
 disarm,


Israel
 could
 see
 itself
 going
 back
 to


fighting.
 So
 one,
 I
 think
 of
 the
 main


things
 to
 look
 out
 for
 moving
 forward
 in


the
 negotiations
 is
 this
 issue
 of
 Hamas


disarming.
 And
 there
 will
 be
 a


discussion
 because
 that's
 not
 very
 clear


in
 Trump's
 plan.
 And
 maybe
 it
 shouldn't


be
 because
 it
 was
 more
 of
 a
 general


outline,
 but
 what
 weapons
 exactly


constitute
 that
 disarmament?


>> And
 Gallet,
 you
 mentioned
 that
 the


timeline
 of
 negotiations
 and
 the
 details


are
 still
 being
 worked
 out.
 But
 Jimo,


what
 do
 we
 know
 about
 what
 sorts
 of


negotiations
 will
 be
 unfolding
 in
 the


coming
 days
 and
 over
 the
 weekend?


>> Well,
 in
 the
 short
 term,
 the
 immediate


focus
 is
 on
 implementing
 the
 ceasefire.


Once
 the
 ceasefire
 has
 been
 agreed
 to,


then
 per
 the
 terms
 of
 phase
 one,
 Israel


would
 withdraw
 to
 this
 pre-agreed
 line


that
 would
 leave
 it
 still
 controlling


just
 over
 50%
 of
 Gaza
 Strip.
 Once
 that


happens,
 then
 Hamas
 would
 be
 given
 72


hours
 to
 return
 the
 living
 hostages.
 The


deceased
 hostages,
 the
 timeline
 is


slightly
 longer.
 And
 so,
 you
 would
 think


also
 there
 will
 begin
 uh
 a
 series
 of


operations
 to
 retrieve
 the
 bodies
 of


those
 deceased.
 So
 that
 is
 what's
 going


to
 happen
 in
 the
 short
 term.
 Right
 after


that,
 there
 are
 going
 to
 be
 lots
 of


discussions
 about
 the
 flow
 of


humanitarian
 aid.
 It's
 also
 been
 a
 very


thorny
 topic.
 Who
 will
 be
 administering


it?
 Where
 exactly
 the
 aid
 is
 going
 to
 be


coming
 from?
 How
 many
 lorries
 will
 be


put
 in
 or
 or
 allowed
 into
 the
 Gaza
 Strip


on
 a
 day-to-day
 basis.
 So
 these
 are


technical
 details
 but
 extremely


important
 details
 as
 well
 because
 the


population
 of
 Gaza
 has
 been
 suffering


from
 a
 famine
 and
 severe
 malnutrition


for
 several
 months
 now.


Well
 for
 us
 we've
 talked
 before
 about


this
 long
 path
 to
 rebuilding
 that
 Gaza


has
 ahead
 of
 it
 if
 this
 ceasefire
 holds.


You
 know
 international
 experts
 have
 said


parts
 of
 Gaza
 are
 experiencing
 famine.


Children
 are
 going
 hungry.
 The
 UN


estimates
 that
 nearly
 2
 million


residents
 of
 Gaza
 have
 been
 displaced.


What
 does
 the
 ceasefire
 mean
 in
 the


short
 term
 for
 the
 people
 of
 Gaza?
 And


what
 are
 the
 first
 priorities
 for
 aid


once
 the
 fighting
 stops?


>> The
 issue
 of
 reconstruction
 of
 Gaza
 is


still
 far
 because
 it
 is
 complicated.
 I


think
 if
 Hamas
 is
 to
 stay
 in
 power,
 the


reconstruction
 will
 be
 out
 of
 reach.
 In


the
 short
 term,
 the
 Palestinians
 in
 Gaza


need
 urgent
 uh
 remedial
 and
 intervention


programs
 to
 mitigate
 the
 crisis
 resulted


from
 the
 destruction
 of
 clinics,
 primary


care
 centers,
 schools,
 the


infrastructure,
 the
 sewage
 networks,
 uh


the
 water
 pipelines
 and
 all
 these
 issues


to
 ensure
 there
 will
 be
 no
 spread
 of


disease.
 is
 for
 example
 because
 of
 the


situation


>> and
 then
 of
 course
 finally
 you
 have
 the


question
 of
 who
 is
 going
 to
 be
 governing


Gaza.
 Fattis
 was
 just
 talking
 about
 the


fact
 that
 Hamas
 want
 to
 be
 involved
 in


discussions
 around
 the
 future
 even


though
 they
 have
 said
 that
 they
 are


willing
 to
 uh
 give
 up
 or
 relinquish


their
 actual
 role
 in
 government.
 But
 at


this
 point
 there
 is
 no
 viable


alternative.
 And
 in
 the
 peace
 plan,


they've
 talked
 about
 setting
 up
 this


committee
 of
 eight
 political


Palestinians.
 What
 does
 that
 look
 like


in
 practice?
 So,
 still
 a
 lot
 of


negotiations
 have
 to
 take
 place
 over
 the


next
 coming
 weeks
 and
 months.
