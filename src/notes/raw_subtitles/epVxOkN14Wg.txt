Of
 all
 the
 seismic
 changes
 that


President
 Trump
 has
 made
 in
 his
 second


term,
 perhaps
 the
 most
 overlooked
 and


consequential
 is
 the
 speed
 with
 which
 he


has
 upended
 60
 years
 of
 civil
 rights.


much
 of
 it
 under
 the
 guise
 of
 attacking


DEI.


Today,
 Nicole
 Hannah
 Jones
 on
 the
 end
 of


an
 era
 and
 the
 growing
 fear
 of
 what
 a


post
 civil
 rights
 government
 will
 mean


for
 black
 Americans.


It's
 Tuesday,
 October
 21st.


Nicole,
 before
 we
 get
 started,
 I
 want
 to


reestablish
 your
 background
 for


listeners
 who
 maybe
 haven't
 heard
 you
 on


the
 show
 in
 a
 little
 bit.
 You
 are,
 I


would
 argue,
 the
 preeminent
 authority
 on


the
 subject
 of
 race
 and
 civil
 rights
 in


this
 country,
 not
 just,
 I
 would
 say,
 at


the
 New
 York
 Times,
 but
 in
 American


journalism.
 You're
 the
 creator
 of
 the


1619
 project,
 for
 which
 you
 won
 a


Pulitzer
 Prize
 in
 commentary.
 And
 so


when
 we
 learned
 that
 you
 were
 looking


into
 the
 Trump
 administration's
 big


moves
 around
 DEI,
 that's
 their


description
 of
 this.
 We
 were
 very
 eager


to
 have
 this
 conversation
 with
 you.
 So


thank
 you
 for
 making
 time
 for
 us.


>> Well,
 maybe
 I
 would
 quibble
 with
 the


preeminent
 expert,
 but
 thank
 you
 for


having
 me
 on.


>> And
 here
 I
 want
 to
 begin
 with
 an


admission
 on
 our
 part.
 We
 had
 been


trying
 to
 wrap
 our
 arms
 around
 these


decisions
 that
 the
 Trump
 administration


was
 making
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 DEI
 for


quite
 some
 time
 because
 I
 think
 it's


fair
 to
 say
 it
 was
 easy
 to
 see
 the
 big


moves
 they
 were
 making
 and
 how
 wide


ranging
 this
 effort
 was
 to
 root
 out


anything
 even
 mentioning
 the
 words


diversity,
 equity,
 and
 inclusion.
 But
 it


was
 harder
 to
 understand
 what
 all
 of
 it


was
 driving
 at,
 what
 this
 larger


framework
 was
 that
 this
 fit
 into.
 But


that's
 exactly
 as
 it
 happens,
 what
 you


were
 trying
 to
 do.
 So
 where
 did
 your


reporting
 begin?


>> So
 my
 reporting
 began
 really
 immediately


looking
 at
 the
 executive
 orders
 that


Trump
 rolled
 out
 on
 his
 first,
 second,


third
 day
 of
 office.


and
 seeing
 that,
 you
 know,
 despite
 him


saying
 he
 was
 running
 on
 an
 economic


campaign
 and
 securing
 his
 victory
 on
 the


idea
 of
 economic
 anxiety,
 that
 his
 very


early
 policies
 were
 racial
 policies.


>> On
 his
 first
 day
 back
 in
 the
 Oval


Office,
 Donald
 Trump
 signed
 an
 executive


order
 ending
 diversity,
 equity,
 and


inclusion
 programs
 and
 federal
 agencies.


>> The
 president
 calls
 DEI
 programs


illegal,
 immoral,
 and
 discriminatory.


>> This
 is
 a
 big
 deal.
 merit.
 Our
 country


is
 going
 to
 be
 based
 on
 merit
 again.
 Can


you
 can
 you
 believe
 it?


>> They
 were
 targeting
 what
 he
 was
 broadly


describing
 as
 DEI.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 one
 of
 the
 very
 first
 things
 Trump


did,


>> President
 Trump
 revoked
 an
 executive


order
 signed
 by
 President
 Lyndon
 B.


Johnson
 in
 1965


>> which
 stipulates
 that
 employers
 can't


discriminate
 against
 job
 applicants
 or


workers
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 race,
 gender,


and
 other.
 On
 his
 second
 day
 in
 office,


he
 rescended
 an
 executive
 order
 that


Lyndon
 B.
 Johnson
 had
 issued
 as
 part
 of


the
 civil
 rights
 movement
 in
 order
 to


try
 to
 enforce
 against
 employment


discrimination.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 so
 what
 Trump
 does
 is
 he
 repeals


that
 order,
 but
 he
 repeals
 that
 order
 by


calling
 it
 illegal
 DEI.


And
 my
 antenna
 immediately
 went
 up.


>> Why?


>> Well,
 because
 it's
 clearly
 not
 DEI.
 DEI


is
 something
 different


>> and
 presumably
 didn't
 even
 exist
 back


when
 Lyndon
 B.
 Johnson
 was
 president.


>> Exactly.
 And
 so
 I
 was
 really
 startled


that
 one
 of
 his
 very
 first
 acts
 was
 to


rescend
 this
 executive
 order
 that's


trying
 to
 enforce
 civil
 rights
 law,
 but


also
 that
 he
 was
 labeling
 it
 DEI
 and


labeling
 DEI
 illegal.
 So
 once
 your


antenna
 are
 up
 and
 your
 sense
 is
 that


the
 president's
 campaign
 to
 go
 after
 DEI


is
 something
 else,
 what
 do
 you
 do?
 What


do
 you
 see?


>> Well,
 this
 was
 day
 two.
 You
 know,
 I'm


I'm
 a
 magazine
 writer
 and
 so
 I
 you
 know,


I
 don't
 cover
 breaking
 news.
 I
 kind
 of


>> you
 take
 your
 time
 in
 the
 best
 possible


way,


>> right?
 I
 try
 to
 sit
 back
 and
 really
 see


what's
 the
 larger
 story
 that
 is


unfolding
 here.
 So,
 I'm
 just
 watching


everything
 and
 a
 lot
 is
 happening
 in


those
 early
 days.


>> As
 of
 5
 this
 afternoon,
 every
 federal


DEI
 office
 in
 the
 country
 got
 shuttered.


DEI
 employees
 woke
 up
 this
 morning
 and


found
 out
 their
 emails
 are
 suspended
 and


they've
 been
 put
 on
 leave.
 NBC
 News
 has


learned
 that
 the
 Defense
 Intelligence


Agency
 has
 ordered
 a
 pause
 on
 all
 events


related
 to
 MLK
 Day
 or
 Black
 History


Month.
 Junth,
 Pride
 Month,
 Women's


History
 Month,
 Holocaust
 Remembrance


Day,
 all
 paused.


>> You
 were
 seeing
 kind
 of
 the
 purging
 of


federal
 websites
 that
 were
 talking
 about


black
 first
 or
 women's
 first.


>> The
 National
 Park
 Service
 has
 removed
 of


reference
 to
 abolitionist
 Harriet
 Tubman


from
 its
 web
 page
 that's
 dedicated
 to


the
 Underground
 Railroad.
 military


websites
 also
 taking
 down
 tributes
 to


the
 legendary
 Tuskegee
 airmen.
 The


fabled
 Navajo
 code
 talkers
 of
 World
 War


II
 and
 Ira
 Hayes,
 a
 Native
 American
 and


one
 of
 the
 Marines
 who
 raised
 the
 flag


at


>> there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 eraser
 that
 was


happening
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 ways
 in


this
 bliss
 creek
 of
 targeting
 of
 all


sorts
 of
 efforts
 to
 really
 catalog
 the


history
 of
 this
 multicultural
 country.


>> Mhm.


So,
 I'm
 talking
 with
 my
 editor
 and
 she's


really
 wanting
 me
 to
 do
 a
 story
 that
 is


cataloging
 that
 eraser.
 And
 I
 thought


that
 was
 important.
 And
 yet
 at
 the
 same


time,
 I'm
 also
 looking
 at
 what's


happening
 across
 all
 of
 these
 different


federal
 agencies.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 there's


something
 much
 much
 bigger
 that's


happening
 here
 that
 is
 more
 than
 eraser.


That's
 actually
 about
 basic
 civil


rights.


[Music]


H
 well
 just
 explain
 that
 what
 exactly


did
 you
 see
 happening
 across
 federal


agencies?


>> So
 the
 first
 sign
 like
 I
 mentioned


before
 was
 the
 rescending
 of
 this
 civil


rights
 era
 order
 against
 employment


discrimination


>> and
 then
 it
 quickly
 got
 deeper
 than


that.
 So,
 the
 Trump
 administration
 said


they
 were
 going
 to
 slash
 90%
 of
 the


staff
 for
 this
 civil
 rights
 enforcement


arm
 of
 the
 Department
 of
 Labor.
 The


Trump
 administration
 was
 also
 gutting


the
 civil
 rights
 division
 of
 the
 US


Department
 of
 Education,
 threatening
 to,


you
 know,
 lay
 off
 all
 of
 these
 civil


rights
 lawyers
 at
 the
 Department
 of


Housing
 and
 Urban
 Development,
 going


agency
 by
 agency
 and
 making
 it


impossible
 to
 enforce
 civil
 rights.
 So


for
 instance,
 Lee
 Zelden,
 who's
 the


administrator
 of
 the
 Environmental


Protection
 Agency,
 he
 announces
 that
 the


agency
 is
 eliminating
 all
 10
 of
 its


regional
 environmental
 justice
 and
 civil


rights
 offices.


>> And
 I'm
 noticing
 how
 in
 these
 orders
 and


these
 actions,
 Trump
 is
 conflating
 DEI


with
 civil
 rights.
 He's
 treating
 these


two
 as
 the
 same
 thing.
 And
 so
 it
 becomes


pretty
 clear
 that
 he
 is
 using
 DEI
 to


attack
 civil
 rights.
 Well,
 let's
 just


define
 these
 terms.
 In
 your
 mind,
 the


president
 is
 using
 the
 concept
 of
 DEI
 to


pause,
 reverse,
 in
 some
 cases,
 it
 sounds


like
 perhaps
 even
 eviscerate
 civil


rights,
 but
 quite
 simply,
 what
 exactly


is
 the
 difference?
 Because
 clearly


there's
 a
 strong
 relationship
 between


the
 two.


Civil
 rights
 are
 laws
 and
 legal


protections
 mostly
 passed
 in
 the
 1960s


as
 part
 of
 the
 civil
 rights
 movement


that
 exist
 to
 ensure
 basic
 and
 essential


rights.
 So
 these
 laws
 protect
 our


freedom
 of
 thought
 and
 speech
 and


religion.
 And
 typically
 in
 the
 United


States,
 we
 think
 of
 civil
 rights
 as


protecting
 minority
 groups
 from


discrimination.
 So,
 we're
 talking
 about


actual
 rights.


>> Mhm.


>> Diversity,
 equity,
 and
 inclusion
 as
 an


ideology.
 It
 arises
 out
 of
 civil
 rights


and
 the
 protections
 that
 civil
 rights


ensure,
 but
 they
 aren't
 the
 same
 things.


We
 don't
 really
 see
 what
 we
 today
 know


as
 DEI
 until


2010
 or
 so.
 And
 you
 don't
 see
 the


peripheration
 of
 DEI


across
 nearly
 every
 American
 institution


until
 after
 2020
 with
 the
 murder
 of


George
 Floyd
 and
 the
 racial
 reckoning.


What
 we
 typically
 think
 of
 today
 as
 DEI,


I
 mean,
 it
 it
 really
 it
 doesn't
 have
 a


single
 definition.
 So
 DEI
 could
 be
 that


corporate
 training
 that
 you
 had
 to
 go


through
 about
 privilege
 and
 how
 race


works.
 It
 could
 be
 a
 training
 about


gender
 or
 it
 could
 be
 programs
 to
 try
 to


make
 workspaces
 more
 inclusive
 of
 people


of
 color
 or
 other
 marginalized
 groups.


It
 could
 be
 really
 just
 about
 anything.


>> And
 that's
 a
 little
 squishier
 obviously


than
 civil
 rights.
 And
 look,
 I
 myself


was
 a
 critic
 of
 DEI
 because
 I
 felt
 so


much
 of
 it
 was
 performative
 that,
 you


know,
 you
 had
 companies
 where
 you
 could


look
 at
 their
 hiring
 track
 record.
 What


percentage
 of
 black
 people
 do
 you
 employ


in
 management
 and
 yet
 they're
 putting


out
 these
 statements
 and
 hiring
 DEI


officers
 who
 would
 have
 no
 budget
 and
 no


power
 and
 yet
 had
 this
 very
 public


position.


>> Some
 of
 it
 became
 virtue
 signaling.


>> Yes,
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 that.
 And
 so,


you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 probably
 roll


their
 eyes
 at
 DEI
 that
 that's
 where
 we


are
 in
 this
 country.
 And
 so,
 weren't


really
 realizing
 that
 something
 much


much
 more
 essential
 and
 dangerous
 was


happening.
 But
 I
 was
 seeing


kind
 of
 agency
 by
 agency,
 this
 entire


civil
 rights
 infrastructure


that
 had
 been
 set
 up
 over
 decades
 being


dismantled.
 And
 that
 was
 happening
 at
 a


pace
 and
 a
 rate
 and
 a
 sophistication


that
 we
 had
 not
 seen
 before.


>> Well,
 Nicole,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 linger
 on


that
 idea
 for
 a
 moment.
 How
 exactly


could
 it
 be
 possible
 that
 what
 begins
 as


a
 dismantling
 of
 DEI
 somehow
 becomes
 the


dismantling
 of
 civil
 rights
 itself?


Because
 so
 many
 of
 the
 civil
 rights
 in


this
 country
 come
 from
 constitutional


amendments,
 come
 from
 laws
 like
 the


Civil
 Rights
 Act
 of
 1964
 that
 would
 seem


to
 make
 them
 not
 at
 all
 easy
 to
 roll


back
 or
 dismantle
 in
 the
 first
 place.
 So


just
 explain
 that.


>> Well,
 laws
 are
 not
 self-
 enforcing,


right?
 This
 is
 why
 you
 have
 laws
 against


murder
 and
 robbery,
 but
 you
 still
 have
 a


police
 department
 that
 has
 to
 go
 out
 and


enforce
 the
 law.
 And
 so
 that's
 the
 same


thing
 with
 federal
 agencies.
 Most
 people


I
 found
 are
 actually
 surprised
 that


every
 major
 federal
 agency
 actually
 has


a
 civil
 rights
 enforcement
 division


within
 that
 agency.


>> And
 there's
 a
 reason
 for
 that.
 The


federal
 government
 touches
 every
 aspect


of
 American
 lives.
 And
 it
 is
 actually


the
 greatest
 tool
 therefore
 of
 enforcing


civil
 rights
 law
 because
 you
 know
 all


types
 of
 private
 contractors
 engage
 with


the
 federal
 government,
 our
 public


benefits,
 all
 of
 these
 institutions.
 And


so
 out
 of
 the
 1964
 Civil
 Rights
 Act,
 we


see
 this
 growth
 of
 civil
 rights
 offices


within
 the
 various
 divisions
 to
 ensure


that
 any
 community
 that
 the
 federal


government
 was
 engaging
 with
 was
 going


to
 have
 robust
 civil
 rights
 enforcement.


So
 why
 does
 that
 matter
 so
 much
 at
 the


federal
 level?
 We
 have
 to
 understand,


you
 know,
 the
 reason
 we
 even
 needed


federal
 civil
 rights
 laws
 was
 because
 in


some
 states,
 the
 state
 was
 actively


discriminating
 against
 black
 Americans.


They
 had
 segregation
 laws
 and


segregation
 mandates.
 And
 so
 on
 a


state-by-state
 basis,
 black
 Americans


often
 could
 not
 go
 to
 their
 government


to
 get
 relief
 from
 discrimination.
 Not


their
 local
 government,
 not
 their
 state


government.
 So
 the
 federal
 government


had
 to
 step
 in
 really
 historically
 going


all
 the
 way
 back
 to
 the
 end
 of
 slavery


to
 ensure
 that
 black
 Americans
 rights


were
 being
 enforced
 across
 the
 country.


So
 the
 social
 security
 department
 has
 a


civil
 rights
 division
 or
 at least
 it


did.
 And
 that
 was
 because
 black


Americans
 actually
 face
 discrimination


in
 trying
 to
 obtain
 their
 social


security
 benefits.
 the
 Veterans


Administration,
 it's
 been
 shown
 that


black
 Americans
 face
 discrimination
 in


trying
 to
 access
 their
 veterans


benefits.
 So,
 there's
 a
 civil
 rights


division
 in
 that
 agency,
 or
 at least


there
 was.


>> And
 so,
 the
 idea
 is
 that
 if
 you're
 going


to
 your
 local
 Social
 Security
 office
 and


saying,
 "I'm
 here
 to
 get
 my
 check."
 And


the
 local
 office
 said,
 "No,
 I'm
 not


giving
 you
 your
 Social
 Security
 check."


Then
 that
 could
 be
 appealed
 to
 the
 Civil


Rights
 Division
 of
 the
 Social
 Security


Administration,
 who
 would
 then
 redress


it,


>> right?
 And
 so
 this
 is
 true
 across
 all
 of


these
 different
 federal
 agencies.
 And
 we


tend
 to
 think
 of
 and
 of
 course
 I
 talk


about
 civil
 rights
 often
 through
 the


frame
 of
 black
 Americans,
 but
 these


rights
 protect
 all
 Americans.
 And
 so


it's
 been
 very
 critical
 for
 women,
 for


people
 who
 come
 from
 foreign
 countries,


for
 people
 who
 come
 from
 a,
 you
 know,


minority
 religion,
 for
 people
 who
 are


disabled,
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 their


rights
 that
 exist
 on
 paper
 vindicated.


And
 so
 to
 have
 those
 agencies
 either


fully
 dismantled
 or
 crippled,


>> it
 sends
 a
 signal
 that
 there's
 going
 to


be
 very
 little
 civil
 rights
 enforcement.


>> Right.
 And
 from
 what
 you're
 saying,


without
 the
 federal
 infrastructure
 of


enforcing
 civil
 rights
 law,
 those
 civil


rights
 laws
 in
 a
 certain
 sense
 cease
 to


do
 what
 they're
 intended
 to
 do.


>> Yes,
 absolutely.
 You
 know,
 I
 I
 think
 we


look
 back
 on
 that
 period
 of
 the
 civil


rights
 movement
 in
 kind
 of
 gauzy
 ways.


We
 forget
 what
 it
 took
 to
 actually
 get


those
 rights
 in
 this
 country.
 That
 black


Americans
 were
 fighting
 for
 80
 years
 to


get
 those
 rights.
 That
 this
 was
 a
 bloody


and
 deadly
 fight.
 There
 were
 political


assassinations.
 There
 were
 lynchings.


That
 these
 rights
 had
 been
 violently


suppressed.
 And
 we
 tend
 to
 tell
 the


story
 that
 once
 those
 rights
 were


achieved,
 then
 all
 of
 that
 anger
 and


hatred
 and
 belief
 that
 black
 Americans


should
 stay
 in
 their
 place
 that
 it
 just


dissipated
 overnight
 with
 the
 signing
 of


these
 laws.
 It
 didn't.


>> That
 was
 ingrained
 in
 our
 society.
 And


so
 almost
 immediately
 after
 the
 passage


of
 those
 civil
 rights
 laws
 of
 the
 1960s,


we
 see
 a
 backlash.


>> We're
 soliciting
 opinions
 on
 the
 civil


rights
 bill.
 Would
 you
 like
 to
 give
 us


yours?
 I
 sure
 don't
 like
 it.
 That's
 for


sure.


>> I
 don't
 like
 it.
 I
 think
 they're
 just


trying
 to
 put
 something
 on
 the
 owners


that
 we
 don't
 want.


>> And
 I
 think
 this
 is
 the
 most
 ridiculous


thing
 that
 has
 ever
 happened.


>> Almost
 immediately,
 we
 see
 a
 movement


that
 says
 these
 laws
 are
 too
 ownorous,


that
 it's
 victimizing
 white
 Americans


who
 have
 the
 federal
 government
 prying


in
 their
 business.


>> Why
 can't
 the
 federal
 government
 leave


us
 alone
 and
 give
 us
 our
 school?
 You


started
 to
 see
 for
 instance
 restrictions


on
 efforts
 to
 integrate
 schools.


>> We
 want
 no
 trouble.
 We
 don't
 condemn


these
 black
 people.
 They
 are
 human


beings
 too.
 We
 understand
 that.
 But
 we


want
 our
 school.


>> You
 see,
 within
 a
 few
 years
 of
 the
 civil


rights
 movement,
 a
 Supreme
 Court
 case


challenging
 affirmative
 action
 programs


in
 college.


>> Today,
 there
 was
 talk
 of
 white
 and


black,
 in
 particular,
 the
 rights
 of
 the


white
 person.
 This
 was
 not
 heard
 before.


I
 as
 a
 white
 person
 I'm
 discriminated


against
 because
 of
 you
 know
 reverse


discrimination.
 So
 I
 feel


>> and
 you
 see
 you
 know
 the
 Reagan


administration
 bring
 these
 anti-white
 or


what
 they
 would
 call
 reverse


discrimination
 findings
 through
 the


department
 of
 education
 and
 that
 just


only
 gains
 momentum
 when
 George
 Bush


took
 over.


>> So
 this
 has
 long
 been
 a
 pattern.
 I
 mean,


some
 folks
 wanted
 to
 overturn
 the
 1964


Civil
 Rights
 Act.
 There
 wasn't
 a


political
 will
 to
 do
 that,
 but
 you
 could


defang
 it.


So,
 we
 see
 over
 time
 the
 steady
 chipping


away
 of
 the
 ability
 to
 use
 civil
 rights


law
 to
 affirmatively
 remedy
 years
 of


racial
 discrimination.


And
 under
 Trump,
 you
 kind
 of
 see
 this


60-year
 vision
 meet
 its
 perfect
 moment.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


So
 Nicole,
 take
 us
 more
 deeply
 inside


the
 Trump
 administration's
 dismantling


of
 these
 civil
 rights
 enforcement


mechanisms
 in
 federal
 agencies
 and
 how


it
 starts
 to
 we
 think
 impact
 the
 ability


of
 civil
 rights
 laws
 to
 actually
 do


their
 intended
 job.
 So
 we
 can
 look
 at
 a


place
 like
 the
 Department
 of
 Education,


which
 despite
 what
 the
 Trump


administration
 says,
 the
 Department
 of


Education
 does
 not
 set
 curriculum.


That's
 set
 at
 the
 local
 and
 state
 level.


It
 doesn't
 hire
 teachers.
 More
 than


anything
 else,
 the
 Department
 of


Education
 exists
 as
 a
 civil
 rights


enforcement
 division.


>> It
 really
 exists
 to
 enforce
 and
 assure


the
 rights
 of
 students.
 But
 what
 you've


seen
 under
 the
 Trump
 administration
 is


they
 shuttered
 most
 of
 the
 regional


divisions
 charged
 with
 enforcing
 those


rights.
 So
 what
 does
 that
 mean?
 One
 of


the
 major
 things
 that
 the
 Department
 of


Education
 does
 is
 it
 enforce
 the
 rights


of
 students
 who
 have
 disabilities.


Students
 with
 disabilities
 are
 supposed


to
 receive
 special
 services,
 but
 those


services
 are
 often
 very
 expensive.
 And


so
 sometimes
 school
 districts
 won't


provide
 them.
 The
 Department
 of


Education
 Civil
 Rights
 Division
 will


ensure
 that
 students
 if
 they
 have
 a


complaint,
 if
 they're
 not
 receiving
 the


services
 that
 they
 are
 entitled
 to,
 that


those
 districts
 comply


>> and
 also
 they
 enforce
 the
 law
 for


English
 language
 learners
 who
 have
 a


right
 to
 an
 appropriate
 education.
 They


enforce
 equal
 access
 to
 sports
 under


Title
 9.
 And
 then
 they
 also
 enforce


against
 all
 of
 the
 racial
 disparities


that
 black
 and
 other
 students
 face


really
 across
 every
 level
 of
 education.


So
 when
 you
 see
 these
 efforts
 to


dismantle
 the
 Department
 of
 Education,


which
 is
 what
 the
 Trump
 administration


has
 said,
 is
 he
 really
 wants
 to
 shutter


the
 entire
 Department
 of
 Education,
 what


they're
 really
 shuttering
 is
 the
 ability


to
 enforce
 civil
 rights
 law
 across


America's
 schools.
 And
 as
 you
 said


earlier,
 when
 that
 federal
 enforcement


goes
 away,
 then
 any
 complaint,
 any


lawsuit,
 any
 objection
 really
 falls
 back


to
 the
 local
 school
 district,
 which
 for


a
 variety
 of
 reasons
 may
 not
 have
 much


of
 an
 incentive
 to
 do
 anything.


>> Exactly.
 Because
 if
 your
 local
 and
 state


government
 are
 the
 actors
 who
 are


committing
 the
 discrimination,
 where
 do


you
 go
 now?
 really
 the
 only
 avenue
 for


red
 address
 that
 people
 would
 have
 would


be
 to
 pay
 a
 private
 lawyer
 or
 to
 find
 a


civil
 rights
 organization
 who
 might


represent
 them.
 And
 so
 where
 we
 once
 had


the
 full
 weight
 and
 power
 of
 the
 federal


government,
 the
 federal
 government
 has


gutted
 nearly
 all
 the
 offices
 that
 will


enforce
 the
 law.


>> Okay.
 Take
 us
 inside,
 if
 you
 could,


another
 agency
 where
 we
 are
 seeing
 this


dismantling
 of
 civil
 rights
 enforcement.


There's
 probably
 nowhere
 where
 this


gutting
 is
 more
 profoundly
 troubling


than
 what's
 happening
 at
 the
 Department


of
 Justice.
 So,
 of
 course,
 the


Department
 of
 Justice
 is
 this
 nation's


most
 foundational
 law
 enforcement


agency.
 And
 in
 fact,
 the
 Civil
 Rights


Division
 at
 the
 Department
 of
 Justice
 is


considered
 kind
 of
 the
 crown
 jewel
 of


civil
 rights
 enforcement
 in
 the
 country.


It
 was
 created
 by
 the
 Civil
 Rights
 Act


of
 1957


precisely
 to
 protect
 the
 voting
 rights


of
 black
 citizens
 and
 to
 prosecute


crimes
 that
 were
 being
 committed
 against


civil
 rights
 workers.
 But
 now
 under
 the


Trump
 administration,
 if
 you
 look
 at


what
 that
 civil
 rights
 division
 has


actually
 done,
 it's
 moved
 to
 dismiss


voting
 rights
 cases
 and
 civil
 rights


cases
 involving
 police
 departments
 under


the
 guise
 of
 enforcing
 Trump's
 anti-Dei


mandate.
 So
 for
 instance,
 the
 Justice


Department
 walked
 away
 from
 overseeing


the
 Louisville
 Police
 Department,
 and


that
 oversight
 had
 been
 initiated
 by
 the


Biden
 administration
 following
 the


killing
 of
 Briana
 Taylor.
 The
 Justice


Department
 instead
 is
 going
 to
 actually


target
 organizations
 and
 institutions
 in


this
 country
 for
 trying
 to
 integrate
 and


comply
 with
 the
 affirmative
 action


mandates
 of
 the
 civil
 rights
 law.


>> On
 what
 basis?


>> Well,
 on
 the
 basis
 that
 these
 efforts


are
 anti-white,
 that
 they
 are
 racially


discriminatory


against
 white
 Americans.
 Hm.
 So
 on
 top


of
 dismantling
 much
 of
 the
 enforcement


capacity
 across
 all
 these
 agencies,
 what


you're
 pointing
 to
 is
 a
 change
 in
 who


the
 administration
 is
 fighting
 for,
 who


it
 sees
 as
 the
 victims
 of


discrimination.


>> Exactly.
 So
 you
 see
 this
 when,
 for


instance,
 the
 Department
 of
 Justice


moves
 to
 dismiss
 this
 landmark
 civil


rights
 lawsuit
 against
 this
 chemical


company
 that
 was
 emitting
 so
 many


pollutants
 into
 this
 poor
 black


community
 in
 Louisiana's
 cancer
 alley


that
 that
 community
 faced
 the
 highest


cancer
 risk
 in
 the
 whole
 country.


>> Wow.
 But
 the
 administration
 sought
 to


dismiss
 that
 case
 because
 they
 said
 that


it
 wasn't
 the
 black
 community
 that
 was


being
 victimized,
 but
 that
 it
 was
 the


company
 that
 was
 being
 discriminated


against.
 And
 we're
 seeing
 again
 and


again
 through
 their
 language
 and
 their


actions,
 they
 are
 constantly
 focusing
 on


what
 they
 consider
 to
 be
 anti-white


discrimination.


>> And
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to
 say


trying
 to
 actually
 redefine
 white
 people


as
 the
 primary
 victims
 of
 racism
 and


discrimination
 in
 the
 United
 States.


That's
 not
 backed
 up
 by
 any
 of
 the
 data


we
 know,
 even
 self-reporting
 amongst


white
 Americans.


>> Well,
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 is
 it
 possible


that
 we
 don't
 end
 up
 in
 this
 situation,


Nicole,
 if
 not
 for
 DEI?
 Would
 the
 Trump


administration
 be
 able
 to
 do
 what
 it
 is


now
 doing
 as
 quickly
 and
 as
 thoroughly


as
 it's
 doing
 it
 if
 not
 for
 the
 birth
 of


the
 expansion
 of
 the


institutionalization
 of
 diversity,


equity,
 and
 inclusion?
 This
 mushier


thing
 that
 I
 don't
 see
 you
 assigning


anywhere
 near
 as
 much
 importance
 to
 as


the
 traditional
 civil
 rights
 law
 and


infrastructure.


>> I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 Michael,
 that's
 hard


to
 say.
 Mhm.


>> I
 don't
 know
 that
 even
 without
 those
 DEI


efforts,
 we
 wouldn't
 have
 arrived
 here


anyway
 because
 of
 course
 we
 have
 been
 on


this
 trajectory
 for
 60
 years.
 But
 I


certainly
 think
 that
 in
 terms
 of
 a


propaganda
 tool,
 DEI
 and
 the
 co-opting


of
 that
 term
 has
 been
 very
 useful.
 And
 I


don't
 think
 that
 all
 of
 the


organizations
 that
 kind
 of
 engaged
 in


this
 performative
 DEI
 have
 done
 civil


rights
 any
 favors
 because
 I
 do
 think
 you


know
 Michael
 and
 the
 polling
 shows
 that


there
 was
 a
 weariness
 with
 DEI
 among


some
 circles
 that
 there
 was
 a
 sense
 that


some
 DEI
 practices
 went
 too
 far.
 I
 don't


actually
 think
 it's
 a
 justification.
 I


don't
 think
 that
 some
 training
 you
 had


to
 sit
 through
 that
 you
 didn't
 like
 or


some
 person
 who
 put
 something
 on
 a


website
 that
 you
 took
 offense
 to
 can


justify
 kind
 of
 where
 we
 are.
 But
 I
 do


think
 it
 dampened
 opposition
 to
 settled


civil
 rights
 law
 and
 enforcement
 being


undone.


>> I'm
 glad
 you
 used
 that
 word
 dampen


opposition
 because
 that
 seems
 like


something
 we
 should
 talk
 about.
 Trump's


message
 is
 not
 just
 finding
 an
 audience


with
 Republicans
 in
 the
 United
 States.


It
 would
 seem
 there's
 not
 very
 much
 push


back,
 you
 could
 contend,
 from
 Democrats


either.
 And
 that
 would
 perhaps
 suggest


that
 the
 problem
 as
 you
 see
 it
 is
 not


viewed
 in
 a
 bipartisan
 way
 as
 a
 problem.


>> I
 think
 that
 is
 true
 to
 a
 degree.


Polling
 shows
 that
 the
 majority
 of


Republicans
 see
 efforts
 to
 ameliorate


racism
 as
 making
 life
 more
 difficult
 for


white
 Americans.
 That
 they
 tend
 to
 see


racism
 against
 black
 Americans
 as
 a


major
 problem
 but
 of
 the
 past.
 And
 that


now
 white
 Americans
 are
 suffering
 from


racism
 more
 than
 any
 other
 group.
 But


more
 surprising,
 I
 would
 imagine,
 is
 the


fact
 that
 since
 the
 time
 of
 the
 2024


election,
 polling
 on
 racial
 attitudes


showed
 that
 the
 percentage
 of
 Democrats


who
 believe
 that
 white
 Americans
 benefit


a
 great
 deal
 from
 advantages
 in
 society


that
 black
 Americans
 don't
 have
 has


plummeted
 15
 percentage
 points
 in
 just


two
 years.
 M


>> I
 don't
 know
 that
 we
 can
 blame
 that
 on


DEI,
 but
 certainly
 there
 was
 some


societal
 force
 that
 was
 leading
 white


Americans
 to
 say,
 "Okay,
 maybe
 this
 has


gone
 too
 far."
 And
 I
 think
 that
 there
 is


a
 significant
 constituency
 who
 doesn't


really
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 race
 anymore.


And
 that
 while
 they
 may
 not
 agree
 with


other
 Trump
 policies,
 they
 don't


actually
 disagree
 with
 these
 that
 much.


>> I
 mean,
 let's
 just
 ask
 this
 plainly.
 is


for
 all
 the
 reasons
 we're
 talking
 about


the
 dismantling
 of
 the
 structures
 as


well
 as
 the
 polling
 and
 the
 public


opinion
 that
 seems
 to
 not
 be
 all
 that


opposed
 to
 it.
 Does
 that
 amount
 to
 the


modern
 era
 of
 civil
 rights
 for
 black


Americans
 specifically


now
 being
 over?


Unfortunately,


that's
 what
 it
 feels
 like
 because
 I


think
 that
 we
 are
 on
 the
 cusp
 of
 an


America
 that
 no
 one
 our
 age,
 Michael,


has
 ever
 lived
 in
 before.
 I
 mean,
 this


is
 where
 I
 think
 history
 really
 matters.


>> Explain
 that.
 This
 country
 has


experienced
 another
 period
 where
 black


Americans
 gained
 all
 of
 these
 rights
 and


those
 rights
 would
 remain
 on
 paper
 but


they
 would
 lose
 any
 ability
 to
 actually


access
 them.


And
 that
 period
 was
 called
 the
 Nadier.


It
 was
 named
 so
 by
 a
 historian
 by
 the


name
 of
 Rayford
 Logan.


He
 named
 it
 the
 Nadier
 because
 Nadier


means
 the
 low
 point.


This
 was
 the
 period
 after


reconstruction.
 Reconstruction
 was


really
 about
 ensuring
 that
 people
 who


had
 been
 enslaved
 will
 now
 be
 able
 to


access
 full
 citizenship
 in
 this
 country.


So
 we
 passed
 the
 13th
 amendment
 which


ends
 slavery,
 the
 14th
 amendment
 which


for
 the
 first
 time
 puts
 equal
 protection


in
 the
 constitution.
 No
 matter
 your


race,
 the
 law
 has
 to
 treat
 you
 the
 same.


It's
 also
 what
 gives
 us
 birthright


citizenship.
 And
 we
 get
 the
 15th


amendment
 which
 ensures
 that
 you
 cannot


be
 denied
 the
 right
 to
 vote
 based
 on


your
 race.
 This
 is
 the
 period
 of
 time


where
 the
 nation
 passes
 its
 first
 civil


rights
 law,
 the
 1866
 Civil
 Rights
 Act,


and
 that's
 followed
 by
 the
 1875
 Civil


Rights
 Act.
 It's
 this
 remarkable
 period


because
 literally
 just
 a
 few
 years
 out


of
 slavery,
 you
 have
 black
 men
 who
 had


been
 enslaved
 who
 are
 now
 serving
 in


Congress.
 They're
 in
 the
 Senate.
 They're


in
 the
 House
 of
 Representatives.
 We
 have


an
 integrated
 university
 in
 South


Carolina.
 There's
 integrated
 public


schools
 in
 Louisiana.
 And
 you
 see
 this


broad
 expansion
 of
 black
 rights.
 And
 it


probably
 seemed
 at
 that
 moment
 that


progress
 was
 inevitable.


>> Mhm.


>> But
 it
 wasn't.


There
 was
 a
 tremendous
 backlash.


You
 start
 to
 see
 efforts
 to
 make
 it


harder
 for
 black
 Americans
 to
 vote.
 So


that's
 where
 we
 get
 the
 grandfather


clauses
 and
 the
 pole
 taxes
 and
 the


literacy
 test.
 Pretty
 soon
 there
 are
 no


black
 people
 left
 in
 Congress.
 Then
 you


see
 things
 like
 southern
 states
 that
 had


integrated
 transportation
 and
 integrated


neighborhoods
 start
 to
 pass
 laws
 of


segregation
 to
 tell
 black
 people
 where


they
 could
 eat,
 where
 they
 could
 go
 to


school,
 where
 they
 had
 to
 sit
 on
 a


train.
 And
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 upholds


that.
 So
 we
 have
 this
 great
 expanse
 of


rights
 and
 then
 just
 as
 quickly
 those


rights
 one
 by
 one
 by
 one
 are
 removed.
 So


we
 know
 that
 this
 country
 is
 capable
 of


doing
 that.


>> I
 mean
 we
 are
 commonly
 taught
 about
 the


civil
 rights
 movement
 as
 this


achievement
 a
 time
 that
 we
 should
 be


proud
 of
 without
 really
 questioning
 why


a
 civil
 rights
 movement
 had
 to
 be
 fought


in
 the
 1960s
 in
 the
 first
 place.


The
 civil
 rights
 movement
 was
 not
 an


effort
 for
 black
 Americans
 to
 attain


their
 rights,
 but
 to
 reinstate
 them,


>> to
 get
 those
 rights
 back
 that
 they
 had


achieved
 a
 century
 earlier
 and
 that
 the


Nadier
 had
 erased.
 And
 so
 as
 I'm


watching
 everything
 that's
 unfolding,


I
 just
 couldn't
 help
 feeling
 like
 we
 may


be
 at
 the
 cusp
 of
 a
 second
 Nadier.


You
 you're
 beginning
 to
 do
 this,
 but
 I


wonder
 if
 you
 can
 describe
 if
 a
 second


NAR
 comes
 to
 pass,
 what
 does
 it
 look


like
 given
 the
 progress
 that
 has
 been


made
 in
 this
 country
 over
 the
 last
 many


decades?
 almost
 by
 definition,
 correct


me
 if
 I'm
 wrong,
 the
 bottom
 of
 a
 second


Nadier
 looks
 tremendously
 different
 than


the
 bottom
 of
 the
 first.


>> I
 I
 do
 think
 you're
 making
 an
 important


point
 that
 obviously
 even
 with
 the
 first


Nadier,
 they
 didn't
 reinstate
 slavery.


So
 all
 progress
 was
 not
 erased,
 but
 a


significant
 amount
 of
 progress
 was


erased.
 And
 I
 I
 think
 when
 we
 look
 at


the
 landscape
 that
 is
 being
 created,
 not


only
 are
 companies
 losing
 an
 incentive


to
 try
 to
 integrate,
 but
 they
 would


actually
 be
 penalized
 if
 they
 do.
 So


Trump
 has
 threatened
 to
 investigate
 law


firms
 that
 have
 integration
 programs


where
 they're
 trying
 to
 diversify
 the


profession.
 I
 think
 only
 4%
 of
 lawyers


at
 all
 law
 firms
 are
 black.
 compared
 to


the
 fact
 we
 should
 probably
 say
 that


black
 Americans
 make
 up
 about
 14%
 of
 the


population.


>> Exactly.
 So
 if
 you
 are
 going
 to
 actually


say
 that
 you
 will
 investigate
 law
 firms


if
 they're
 trying
 to
 integrate
 that


could
 lead
 to
 a
 scenario
 where
 there
 are


almost
 no
 black
 lawyers.
 We
 look
 at


medical
 schools.
 uh
 America
 First
 law


firm,
 which
 was
 founded
 by
 Steven


Miller,
 Trump's
 right-hand
 man,
 is


sending
 letters
 and
 filing
 complaints


against
 medical
 school,
 saying
 that
 they


are
 discriminating
 because
 they
 have


raceconscious
 admissions
 programs.
 Uh
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 settlements
 that
 Trump


is
 making
 with
 Colombia,
 for
 instance,


or
 the
 demands
 of
 a
 place
 like
 Harvard


or
 Brown,
 they're
 also
 saying
 we
 have
 to


look
 at
 your
 books.
 We
 need
 to
 see
 the


test
 scores
 and
 race
 of
 every
 person
 you


admit,
 as
 well
 as
 all
 of
 the
 hiring


information
 on
 everyone
 you
 hire.
 Well,


if
 I
 am
 a
 university,
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


very
 reticent
 to
 hire
 too
 many
 black


people,
 admit
 too
 many
 black
 students


because
 I
 may
 meet
 the
 wrath
 of
 the


federal
 government
 that
 is
 going
 to
 say


that
 I
 violated
 the
 civil
 rights
 law.
 M


so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 fact
 that
 he's


saying
 DEI
 is
 illegal
 and
 that
 companies


that
 they
 believe
 are
 engaging
 in
 DEI


are
 violating
 the
 law
 and
 could
 face


criminal
 prosecution,
 you
 can
 very


quickly
 imagine
 a
 world
 where
 it
 is


exceedingly
 difficult
 for
 black


Americans.


>> Mhm.


And
 so
 I
 think
 about,
 you
 know,
 reading


IDB
 Wells
 diary,


IDB
 Wells,
 of
 course,
 the
 great


journalist
 and
 civil
 rights
 activist
 who


was
 born
 right
 at
 the
 period
 of


emancipation.
 And
 she
 she
 is
 witnessing


having
 experienced
 all
 of
 these
 rights


and
 this
 vast
 expansion
 of
 possibility


for
 black
 Americans
 and
 then
 slowly


watches
 as
 those
 rights
 are
 being
 taken


away
 one
 by
 one
 by
 one.


And
 if
 we
 look
 at
 that
 timeline,
 black


Americans
 would
 not
 regain
 full
 access


to
 the
 ballot
 for
 nearly
 a
 century.
 We


wouldn't
 have
 another
 black
 senator
 for


nearly
 a
 century.
 Uh
 the
 University
 of


South
 Carolina,
 which
 was
 the
 only


integrated
 public
 university
 in
 the


south
 at
 that
 time,
 wouldn't
 reintegrate


for
 nearly
 another
 century.


So,
 I
 don't
 know
 exactly
 what's
 going
 to


happen,
 but
 what
 I'm
 saying
 is
 all
 of


the
 ingredients
 to
 once
 again
 see
 a


disappearing
 of
 black
 Americans
 from


elite
 institutions,
 from
 prominent
 jobs


and
 professions,
 and
 even
 from
 the
 halls


of
 Congress.
 It
 is
 possible
 in
 this


moment.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it
 will
 happen,


but
 all
 the
 ingredients
 are
 there.
 And


that
 is
 very
 frightening
 to
 me
 because


again
 I
 and
 you
 Michael
 have
 never
 lived


in
 that
 America.
 But
 what
 we
 do
 know
 is


that
 we
 can
 live
 in
 that
 America
 again.

A
 new
 analysis
 shows
 just
 how
 much
 black


officials
 have
 begun
 to
 disappear
 from


the
 most
 senior
 ranks
 of
 the
 federal


government
 in
 President
 Trump's
 second


term.
 Of
 Trump's
 98
 Senate
 confirmed


appointments
 during
 the
 first
 200
 days


of
 the
 second
 term,
 just
 2%
 were
 black.


By
 contrast,
 during
 the
 same
 period,


black
 officials
 accounted
 for
 21%
 of
 the


Senate
 confirmed
 nominees
 under


President
 Biden,
 13%
 under
 President


Obama,
 and
 8%
 under
 President
 George
 W.


Bush.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 black


representation
 in
 Congress
 could
 soon


decline
 as
 well.
 During
 arguments
 last


week,
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 appeared
 poised


to
 roll
 back
 a
 key
 provision
 of
 the


Voting
 Rights
 Act
 of
 1965,


a
 landmark
 Civil
 Rights
 Law
 that
 allowed


race
 to
 be
 used
 as
 a
 factor
 in
 drawing


election
 maps.
 If
 that
 provision
 is


rolled
 back,
 Republicans
 are
 expected
 to


respond
 by
 eliminating
 most
 of
 the


majority
 black
 house
 districts
 across


the
 South.

We'll
 be

Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.


A
 federal
 appeals
 court
 has
 ruled
 that


President
 Trump
 can
 proceed
 with
 his


plan
 to
 deploy
 the
 National
 Guard
 to


Portland,
 Oregon
 over
 the
 objections
 of


local
 and
 state
 officials,
 who
 say
 it's


both
 unnecessary
 and
 illegal.
 A
 lower


court
 judge
 had
 previously
 blocked
 the


deployment,
 finding
 that
 Trump's
 claims


that
 Portland
 was
 experiencing
 violent


civil
 unrest
 was
 overblown.


But
 Monday's
 ruling
 put
 greater
 stock
 in


Trump's
 claims,
 finding
 that
 protests
 in


Portland
 represent
 a
 genuine
 threat
 to


federal
 officials
 and
 to
 a
 federal


building
 there.


And
 in
 a
 series
 of
 text
 messages


obtained
 by
 Politico,
 President
 Trump's


nominee
 to
 lead
 a
 federal
 agency
 used
 a


racist
 slur
 to
 describe
 holidays
 that


honor
 black
 Americans,
 declared
 that


people
 from
 China
 and
 India
 cannot
 be


trusted
 and
 confessed
 to
 having
 what
 he


called
 a
 quote
 Nazi
 streak
 in
 me
 from


time
 to
 time.
 The
 nominee,
 Paul
 and


Gracia,
 is
 Trump's
 choice
 to
 run
 the


Office
 of
 Special
 Counsel,
 which


investigates
 federal
 whistleblower


complaints
 and
 claims
 of
 discrimination.


But
 by
 Monday
 night,
 several
 Republican


senators
 expressed
 doubts
 about


Ingracio's
 nomination,
 including
 Senate


Majority
 Leader
 John
 Thun.
