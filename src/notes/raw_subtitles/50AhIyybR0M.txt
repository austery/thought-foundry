Please
 welcome
 to
 the
 stage
 head
 of


revenue
 at
 Anthropic
 Kate
 Jensen.


[Music]


>> Good
 morning
 everyone.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much


for
 being
 here
 today.
 I'm
 Kate
 Jensen,


the
 head
 of
 revenue
 at
 Anthropic,
 and
 I


am
 so
 excited
 to
 welcome
 you
 to
 the


future
 of
 finance
 powered
 by
 Claude.


I
 want
 to
 invoke
 a
 scene
 that's
 probably


familiar
 to
 many
 of
 you
 in
 the
 audience


today.


You're
 three
 coffees
 deep.
 It's
 3:00


a.m.
 You're
 furiously
 checking
 that
 last


model.
 You
 have
 a
 100
 tabs
 open.
 You


have
 a
 5
 a.m.
 prep
 call
 ready
 for
 a
 6


a.m.
 client
 call.


Today,
 that's
 all
 about
 to
 change.
 We


are
 so
 excited
 to
 announce
 Claude
 for


financial
 analysis.


This
 is
 the
 industry's
 first
 unified


intelligence
 layer
 that
 transforms
 how


financial
 professionals
 will
 work
 with


AI.


Now
 you
 will
 have
 a
 virtual
 first
 class


virtual
 collaborator
 powered
 by
 AI
 that


will
 help
 you
 to
 get
 your
 work
 done


better
 and
 faster.


What
 this
 is
 is
 a
 tailored
 version
 of


cloud
 for
 enterprise.
 It's
 specifically


built
 for
 financial
 analysts,
 and
 it's


equipped
 with
 the
 nuance,
 accuracy,
 and


reasoning
 that
 you
 need
 to
 handle
 the


complexity
 of
 your
 work.


Since
 2021,
 Anthropic
 has
 been
 building


AI
 systems
 that
 are
 helpful,
 harmless,


and
 honest.


At
 our
 foundation
 is
 safety
 and
 trust,


which
 is
 exactly
 what
 financial
 services


companies
 need.


When
 you're
 managing
 billions
 in
 assets,


good
 enough
 just
 isn't
 good
 enough.


AI
 is
 transforming
 every
 industry,
 and


nowhere
 is
 this
 more
 prominent
 than
 in


financial
 services.


The
 complexity
 of
 modern
 markets,
 the


velocity
 of
 information,
 the
 sheer


volume
 of
 data
 that
 you
 need
 to
 process,


it
 has
 reached
 a
 point
 where
 human


intelligence
 alone,
 no
 matter
 how
 great,


just
 isn't
 good
 enough.


From
 speaking
 with
 many
 of
 you,
 our


customers,
 we're
 hearing
 that
 the
 world


is
 bifurcating.
 There
 will
 be
 two
 types


of
 investment
 firms.
 Those
 using
 AI


institutionally
 and
 those
 who
 are
 losing


their
 top
 talent
 to
 competitors
 who
 are


over
 the
 past
 year,
 we
 have
 been


partnering
 with
 leaders
 who
 are
 breaking


new
 ground
 across
 every
 segment
 of
 the


financial
 industry.


The
 teams
 at
 Bridgewater
 have
 been
 using


Claude
 since
 2023.


This
 is
 to
 power
 their
 investment


analyst
 assistance
 which
 solves
 complex


models.
 Their
 CTO
 tells
 us
 that
 Claude


is
 really
 powering
 their
 efforts
 to
 push


the
 boundaries
 of
 what's
 possible.


Down
 in
 Australia,
 Commonwealth
 Bank
 is


making
 a
 massive
 bet
 on
 AI.
 Their
 CTO


Rodrigo
 sees
 our
 partnership
 as
 the


foundation
 of
 their
 global
 AI
 strategy.


And
 here
 in
 New
 York
 at
 AIG,


Peter
 tells
 us
 that
 they
 have
 completely


reimagine
 underwriting
 with
 Claude.
 What


used
 to
 take
 weeks
 is
 now
 taking
 days.


Timelines
 compressed
 more
 than
 5x


and
 accuracy
 has
 gone
 up
 from
 75%
 to


90%.


Underwriters
 can
 now
 serve
 their


customers
 better
 and
 faster.


Now,
 the
 solutions
 we're
 sharing
 today,


we
 didn't
 create
 alone.
 They're
 the


result
 of
 deep
 collaboration
 with
 the


entire
 financial
 ecosystem.


At
 our
 foundation,
 we
 have
 our
 cloud


providers.
 AWS
 and
 GCP
 provide
 secure,


scalable
 infrastructure
 that
 financial


institutions
 demand.


I
 am
 thrilled
 to
 share
 that
 today
 Claude


for
 enterprise
 including
 claude
 for


financial
 services
 is
 now
 available
 on


AWS
 marketplace
 and
 it's
 coming
 soon
 to


the
 Google
 cloud
 marketplace
 as
 well.


We
 hear
 all
 the
 time
 that
 AI
 is
 only
 as


good
 as
 the
 context
 it
 has.


We're
 excited
 to
 partner
 with
 platforms


like
 Box,
 Datab
 Bricks,
 Palunteer,
 and


Snowflake
 to
 bring
 your
 company's
 data


into
 cloud
 so
 that
 you
 have
 the
 context


you
 need
 to
 get
 work
 done
 that's


actually
 relevant
 to
 your
 day-to-day.


And
 today,
 we
 are
 especially
 excited
 to


announce
 new
 integrations
 to
 critical


external
 market
 data
 sources
 for


informing
 your
 most
 important
 financial


decisions.


We're
 partnering
 with
 the
 companies
 you


already
 trust.


Fact
 set
 delivers
 comprehensive


fundamentals
 and
 consensus
 estimates.


S&P
 Global
 enables
 access
 to
 Cap
 IQ


financials,
 market
 data,
 and


transcripts.


Dupa
 provides
 AI
 verified
 fundamentals


with
 source
 citations.


And
 between
 Morning
 Star
 and
 Pitchbook,


you
 have
 both
 public
 investment
 research


and
 private
 market
 intelligence
 at
 your


fingertips.


Our
 consulting
 service
 providers
 are


also
 turning
 this
 technology
 into
 real


business
 transformation.


Deote
 and
 KPMG
 are
 modernizing
 entire


organizations
 and
 deploying
 AI
 agents
 at


scale.


PWC
 and
 Turing
 are
 solving
 critical


regulatory
 challenges,
 navigating


constantly
 evolving
 compliance


requirements


and
 Slalom
 and
 Tribe
 AI
 are
 modernizing


core
 operations
 from
 migrating
 legacy


cobalt
 infra
 to
 accelerating
 due


diligence
 with
 intelligent
 document


processing.


Collectively,
 we
 are
 building
 the
 AI


ecosystem
 that
 will
 define
 the
 future
 of


financial
 services.


As
 our
 head
 of
 revenue,
 my
 team
 and
 I


spend
 all
 of
 our
 time
 talking
 to


customers
 and
 partners.
 We
 heard
 from


you
 how
 important
 it
 was
 to
 bring
 all
 of


this
 context,
 both
 internal
 and


external,
 into
 cloud
 to
 help
 you
 make


use
 of
 this
 technology.


We
 care
 deeply
 about
 defining
 the
 future


of
 AI
 and
 human
 collaboration.
 and
 thank


you
 for
 your
 feedback.
 We
 are
 thrilled


to
 bring
 this
 solution
 to
 you
 today.


Now,
 I'm
 really
 excited
 to
 welcome
 up
 to


the
 stage
 two
 of
 our
 partners
 who
 help


to
 exemplify
 the
 power
 of
 our
 ecosystem


in
 action.


Peter
 Lerzie
 is
 the
 chief
 strategy


officer
 at
 Kensho
 Technologies,
 S&P


Global's
 AI
 innovation
 hub.
 He's
 been


defining
 how
 AI
 transforms
 financial


data
 into
 actionable
 intelligence.


And
 Vikrambot
 is
 vice
 chair
 and


financial
 services
 industry
 leader
 at


Deote
 where
 he
 has
 been
 helping
 global


financial
 institutions
 navigate
 digital


transformation.
 Please
 welcome
 them
 up


to
 the
 stage.


[Music]


Did
 you
 pick
 that
 song?


>> Yes.


>> It's
 actually
 in
 my
 writer.


>> I
 love
 it.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 being


here.
 You
 have
 both
 been
 instrumental
 in


shaping
 the
 frontier
 of
 AI
 adoption
 at


your
 companies.
 From
 your
 unique
 vantage


point,
 Peter
 with
 data
 and
 intelligence,


VROM
 with
 implementation
 and


transformation.
 what's
 the
 one


breakthrough


that
 you've
 seen
 that
 has
 really
 created


an
 aha
 moment
 at
 your
 companies?


>> So,
 yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 mean
 for
 me
 it's


really
 adoption.
 Um
 I
 I
 mean
 I've
 spent


the
 better
 part
 of
 the
 last
 decade


trying
 to
 get
 financial
 services
 uh


companies
 to
 adopt
 AI
 and
 we've
 had
 some


really
 great
 successes
 with
 traditional


machine
 learning.
 I
 would
 say
 in
 the


world
 of
 generative
 AI
 that
 conversation


is
 very
 very
 different.
 Uh
 it
 it's
 a


it's
 kind
 of
 ho
 how
 can
 you
 serve
 us
 as


quickly
 as
 possible
 the
 data
 that
 is
 in


a
 format
 that
 is
 optimized
 for
 these


large
 language
 model
 use
 cases
 uh
 for


generative
 AI
 and
 how
 can
 I
 make
 sure


that
 the
 data
 that
 you're
 providing
 is


trusted
 that
 it's
 uh
 accurate
 that
 it's


kind
 of
 foundationally
 uh
 a
 part
 of
 the


workflows
 that
 we've
 always
 that
 we've


always
 relied
 on
 and
 so
 I
 think
 for
 us


you
 know
 the
 The
 big
 kind
 of
 uh


surprising
 thing
 about
 generative
 AI
 has


just
 been
 the
 speed
 of
 adoption,
 the


rate
 of
 adoption.
 Um
 you
 know
 we
 it
 has


it's
 it's
 been
 very
 influential
 in
 our


roadmap.
 The
 products
 that
 we've
 that


we've
 kind
 of
 foregrounded
 uh
 for
 us
 our


uh
 LLM
 ready
 API
 uh
 which
 is
 the
 data


behind
 what
 we've
 done
 with
 MCP
 uh
 has


been
 we've
 seen
 like
 enormous
 traction


with
 that.
 uh
 our
 our
 clients
 want
 to


make
 sure
 that
 when
 they're
 interfacing


with
 this
 technology
 that
 they
 can
 rely


on
 trusted
 data
 and
 data
 in
 workflows


that
 they
 that
 are
 already
 existing
 that


they
 can
 then
 automate
 automate
 and


optimize
 with
 large
 language
 models.
 And


so
 that's
 really
 been
 uh
 a
 huge


surprise.
 It's
 going
 into
 these
 client


conversations
 and
 not
 saying,
 "Okay,
 but


here's
 what
 AI
 can
 do
 here.
 Here here's


the
 here's
 the
 kind
 of
 magic
 that
 you


can
 unlock."
 They
 already
 know
 that


part.
 Uh
 it's
 now
 how
 can
 we
 truly
 make


our
 company
 or
 institution
 or
 group
 an


AI
 forward
 group
 and
 also
 uh
 make
 sure


that
 we
 can
 trust
 the
 outputs
 and
 for


that
 you
 need
 you
 need
 trusted
 data.
 So


that
 that's
 kind
 of
 been
 the
 big
 thing


that
 that
 we've
 noticed.
 And
 Vic,
 what


about
 you?
 As
 you
 think
 about
 bringing


this
 technology,
 what
 are
 those
 aha


moments
 that
 get
 people
 to
 really
 adopt


it?


>> We
 we
 have
 really
 an
 AI
 first
 strategy


in
 everything
 we
 do.
 Some
 of
 it
 is


internal
 in
 every
 in
 every
 service
 that


we
 have.
 We
 have
 starting
 to
 embed
 AI,


you
 know,
 kind
 of
 front
 to
 back.
 On
 the


client
 side,
 what
 we're
 seeing
 is
 there


was
 an
 initial
 focus
 on
 productivity
 as


a
 key
 theme
 of
 value
 in
 through
 AI.
 But


what
 is
 really
 happening
 is
 that
 is


expanding
 to
 can
 we
 develop
 new
 products


based
 on
 AI?
 Can
 we
 re
 reimagine


distribution?
 Can
 we
 reimagine
 frontto


back
 processes?
 It
 is
 really
 changing


the
 conversation
 from
 a
 pure


productivity
 as
 a
 value
 driver
 to


revenue
 generation.
 Can
 we
 do
 better


risk
 and
 control?
 Can
 we
 drive
 mo
 more


employee
 and
 client
 experiences?
 So
 as


the
 appetite
 and
 the
 aperture
 of
 value


has
 really
 expanded,
 it
 is
 really


brought
 AI
 into
 everything
 that
 does
 and


every
 piece
 of
 the
 client
 organization.


>> I
 love
 that.
 And
 we'll
 start
 with
 you


this
 time,
 but
 what
 do
 you
 think
 you


need
 to
 do
 differently
 as
 an


organization
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you're


really
 capturing
 that
 full
 value,
 not


just
 adopting
 the
 technology?


>> Yeah.
 So
 I'm
 I'm
 probably
 going
 to
 give


a
 a
 in incorrect
 non-political
 answer.


In
 financial
 services,


>> we
 are
 a
 highly
 regulated
 industry.


Everybody
 knows
 that.
 So
 the
 real


challenge
 is
 in
 this
 battle
 of
 I'll
 say


innovation
 and
 risk
 management.
 How
 do


you
 coexist
 in
 a
 manner
 that
 there's
 not


20
 checkers
 for
 for
 one
 doer
 and
 the


equation
 is
 actually
 flipped
 that
 you


actually
 have
 more
 people
 driving


innovation
 across
 your
 organization
 and


you
 work
 in
 coexistence
 with
 your
 audit


teams
 with
 your
 model
 risk
 teams
 you


know
 all
 the
 other
 players
 that
 are


necessary
 in
 order
 to
 get
 adoption
 um


successful.
 The
 the
 other
 uh
 example
 is


that
 AI
 first
 strategy
 that
 I
 mentioned.


I
 think
 more
 and
 more
 clients
 are


actually
 saying
 AI
 is
 not
 just
 about


driving
 30
 to
 30
 to
 50%
 productivity
 in


the
 CIO
 organization
 or
 anywhere
 else.


It
 is
 really
 about
 changing
 the
 way
 we


do
 business
 and
 to
 do
 that
 they
 are
 how


do
 you
 actually
 bring
 the
 humans
 we
 we


have
 this
 philosophy
 of
 humans
 and


machines
 coexisting
 in
 the
 age
 of
 AI
 and


how
 do
 you
 drive
 the
 human
 change
 at


speed
 and
 scale
 together
 with
 the
 pace


of
 change
 that's
 coming
 through
 AI


>> how
 do
 you
 think
 you
 do
 that
 how
 do
 you


get
 them
 to
 coexist
 and
 adopt
 at
 the


same
 time


>> I I
 I
 think
 it
 it
 it
 is
 not
 one
 answer.


There's
 a
 number
 of
 different
 levers


that
 one
 can
 pull
 in
 order
 to
 drive


that.
 Um
 for
 example,
 some
 organizations


have
 done
 um
 executivemies
 where
 the
 top


300
 executives
 really
 drive
 training.


Some
 are
 doing
 hackathons
 to
 really


think
 about
 certain
 processes
 or
 or


value
 streams
 that
 they
 can
 completely


reimagine.
 um
 there
 is
 you
 know
 complete


AImmies
 and
 trainings
 that
 are
 being


pushed
 forward
 at
 you
 know
 for


developers
 but
 also
 for
 general
 users.


So
 it's
 not
 one
 lever
 I
 think
 in
 the
 end


that's
 going
 to
 drive
 the
 speed
 of
 human


adoption
 of
 AI.
 It's
 a
 number
 of
 things


that
 need
 to
 be
 done
 together.


>> Love
 that.


>> Peter,
 what
 about
 you?
 What
 do
 you
 think


people
 need
 to
 do
 differently
 and


institutions
 need
 to
 do
 differently?


Well,
 I
 think
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 that


honestly
 it
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 like
 and
 I


think
 Vicram
 Vicram
 touched
 on
 it.
 It's


it's
 kind
 of
 a
 culture
 thing
 and
 I
 think


that
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 culture
 does
 have
 to


be
 uh
 top
 down,
 right?
 You
 have
 to
 you


have
 to
 have
 uh
 your
 leadership
 teams


really
 buy
 in
 to
 this
 concept
 of
 AI


first.
 I
 I
 totally
 agree
 with
 that.
 I


think
 uh
 but
 part
 of
 that
 top
 down
 is
 to


also
 embrace
 the
 fact
 that
 in
 many
 of


these
 organizations
 innovation's
 coming


from
 the
 bottom
 up,
 right?
 people
 who


are
 in
 the
 trenches
 doing
 day-to-day


work
 are
 surfacing
 uh
 amazing
 ideas
 uh


not
 just
 for
 productivity
 uh which
 I


think
 is
 is
 oftentimes
 the
 focus
 but
 for


huge
 expansions
 of
 revenue
 opportunity
 I


think
 I
 think
 I
 think
 that's
 absolutely


correct
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 think
 that
 it's


it's
 kind
 of
 changing
 a
 mindset
 around


innovation
 and
 I
 do
 think
 a
 big
 part
 of


that
 is
 understanding
 especially
 in
 our


space
 there
 are
 going
 to
 be
 workflows


where
 being
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 less
 risk


averse
 is
 is
 really
 important
 and
 being


able
 to
 create
 those
 that
 room
 for


experimentation


uh
 is
 going
 to
 be
 really
 important.
 I


mean
 certainly
 for
 us
 at
 Kencho
 uh
 right


we
 we've
 been
 able
 to
 have
 that
 room
 and


and
 the
 way
 that
 that
 it
 works
 for
 us
 is


that
 we
 kind
 of
 operate
 somewhat


independently
 and
 as
 a
 result
 we
 kind
 of


have
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 room
 to


experiment
 but
 then
 you
 know
 crucially


it's
 also
 understanding
 where
 those


boundaries
 are
 uh
 and
 where
 that
 risk
 is


unacceptable
 and
 and
 and
 that's
 I
 think


where
 for
 us
 we've
 also
 seen
 an
 enormous


benefit
 uh
 in
 in
 having
 S&P's
 trusted


data
 as
 our
 kind
 a
 foundational
 core


competency.
 You
 know
 for
 we we've
 we've


been
 on
 this
 journey
 uh
 uh
 creating
 this


grounding
 agent
 uh
 where
 for
 us
 it's


ensuring
 that
 when
 a
 large
 language


model
 is
 interfacing
 with
 our
 data
 that


we're
 taking
 responsibility
 for


automating
 where
 you
 know
 where
 in
 our


entire
 data
 universe
 we're
 going
 to
 pull


and
 and
 query
 those
 data
 sets
 and
 then


surfacing
 that
 data
 with
 citations.
 And


so
 it's
 it's
 both
 right
 enabling


experimentation
 but
 then
 also
 making


sure
 that
 your
 response
 is
 and
 whatever


the
 output
 is
 is
 truly
 grounded
 in
 in


verifiable
 fact.
 So
 I
 think
 there's


there's
 a
 balance
 there
 and
 and
 creating


that
 trust
 is
 is
 something
 that's
 really


important
 to
 us.


>> I
 love
 that
 that
 push
 to
 innovate,
 that


desire
 to
 really
 harness
 all
 the
 energy


that
 you
 have
 from
 your
 organization,


but
 to
 do
 it
 responsibly.
 It's
 really
 at


the
 core
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 we
 do.
 Thank


you
 both
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 up
 and
 thank


you
 for
 the
 partnership.


>> Absolutely.
 Pleasure.
 Thanks.


>> And
 now
 I'm
 thrilled
 to
 welcome
 up
 to


the
 stage
 my
 colleague
 Nick
 Lynn
 who


leads
 our
 product
 for
 Cloud
 for


Financial
 Services.
 Thank
 you
 all.


[Music]


All
 right.
 Thank
 you,
 Kate.
 My
 name
 is


Nick
 Linton
 and
 I
 lead
 product
 for
 Claw


for
 financial
 services.
 I
 am
 also
 a


recovering
 investment
 banker
 and
 private


equity
 investor.
 So,
 I
 was
 the
 analyst
 K


mentioned
 frantically
 trying
 to
 debug


the
 model
 at
 3:00
 a.m.
 while
 building


the
 pitch
 deck
 running
 on
 no
 sleep.


That's
 why
 I
 am
 especially
 excited
 to


share
 what
 we've
 been
 working
 on.


As
 Kate
 mentioned,
 we're
 announcing
 the


Clawed
 Financial
 Analysis
 Solution,


Anthropic's
 first
 offering
 built


specifically
 for
 finance.


Our
 solution
 is
 built
 on
 three
 main


pillars
 of
 what
 comprises
 of
 an
 agent.


First,
 the
 models.
 Now,
 something
 I


always
 think
 about
 is
 that
 the
 models
 we


interact
 with
 today
 are
 the
 worst
 they


will
 ever
 be.


Even
 so,
 Claude
 today
 is
 not
 just


state-of-the-art
 for
 code.
 Claude
 has


been
 specifically
 trained
 for
 finance


domain
 knowledge
 and
 excels
 at
 tasks


like
 data
 analysis
 at
 scale,
 financial


reasoning,
 and
 even
 Excel
 manipulation.


Now
 the
 research
 product
 flywheel
 is
 a


critical
 part
 of
 an
 enthropic
 strategy.


We
 firmly
 believe
 in
 working
 with


customers
 like
 yourselves
 to
 really


understand
 where
 the
 models
 are
 working,


where
 the
 gaps
 are,
 and
 to
 borrow
 a
 term


we
 use
 internally,


hill
 climb,
 to
 improve
 the
 next


generation
 of
 our
 model
 capabilities.


The
 finest
 agent
 benchmark
 published
 by


our
 friends
 at
 vowels.ai


has
 picked
 up
 a
 lot
 of
 traction
 in
 the


industry
 and
 is
 well
 representative
 of


many
 financial
 reasoning
 tasks.


You
 can
 see
 cla
 and
 sonnet
 far


outperform
 competitors.


Similarly,
 cla
 is
 also
 very
 capable
 of


actually
 doing
 the
 work.


One
 of
 our
 partners,
 Fundamental
 Labs,


has
 built
 an
 Excel
 agent
 called
 Shortcut


on
 Opus.


This
 agent
 was
 able
 to
 pass
 five
 out
 of


seven
 levels
 of
 the
 financial
 modeling


World
 Cup
 competition


and
 scored
 over
 83%
 accuracy
 on
 complex


Excel
 and
 financial
 reasoning
 tasks.


Again,
 far
 outperforming
 competitors.


The
 next
 pillar
 of
 our
 solution
 is
 agent


capabilities
 built
 on
 top
 of
 these


models.


Now
 model
 intelligence
 needs
 to
 be


translated
 into
 something
 that's


actually
 useful
 for
 humans.


Claus's
 agent
 capabilities
 are
 flexible


and
 composable
 and
 really
 aim
 at
 solving


the
 core
 problems
 you
 all
 work
 in
 every


single
 day


including
 building
 multimodal
 reports


like
 pitch
 stacks
 investment
 memos


analyzing
 and
 visualizing
 data
 like


benchmark
 analyses
 or
 stock
 price
 and


volume
 charts


and
 natively
 reading
 and
 writing
 Excel


and
 PowerPoint
 documents.


I'm
 excited
 to
 announce
 that
 for
 the


very
 first
 time,
 these
 expanded
 output


capabilities
 are
 now
 in
 research
 preview


exclusively
 for
 select
 customers
 of
 our


financial
 analysis
 solution.


We've
 also
 expanded
 usage
 limits
 to


really
 support
 the
 deep
 work
 analysts


work
 in
 every
 single
 day.
 And
 we've


integrated
 cloud
 code
 to
 support
 use


cases
 like
 analyzing
 much
 larger
 data


sets,
 Monte
 Carlo
 simulations
 and
 risk


analyses.


Finally,
 the
 model
 intelligence
 and


agent
 functionalities
 are
 delivered


through
 our
 very
 flexible
 platform.


Our
 solution
 is
 the
 first
 agent
 with


unified
 intelligence
 across
 all
 the
 core


finance
 data
 sources
 you
 all
 work
 in.


As
 Kate
 and
 Peter
 shared,
 we're
 excited


to
 partner
 with
 industry
 leaders
 like


yourselves
 to
 build
 those
 critical


integrations
 into
 the
 agents
 with
 many


more
 to
 come
 in
 the
 future.


Importantly,
 we're
 delivering
 white


glove
 finance
 specific
 implementation


and
 onboarding
 to
 really
 assist
 you
 all


with
 deployment,
 education,
 and
 change


management.


Now
 this
 is
 of
 course
 built
 with


enterprisegrade
 security
 and
 trust.


We're
 sock
 2
 type2
 certified
 and
 by


default
 we
 do
 not
 train
 any
 of
 our


models
 on
 your
 data.


Now
 our
 solution
 is
 really
 targeted
 at


solving
 the
 problems
 you
 all
 know
 well.


In
 investing,
 insights
 are
 alpha.


The
 ability
 to
 sort
 through
 the
 noise,


build
 a
 thesis,
 get
 to
 an
 investment


decision
 quickly
 is
 paramount.


As
 we've
 heard
 from
 many
 of
 our


customers,
 this
 is
 of
 course
 true
 for


the
 sell
 side
 and
 the
 buy
 side.


To
 summarize
 the
 pain,
 analysts
 work
 in


a
 deluge
 of
 documents
 every
 single
 day


and
 spend
 hours
 researching
 into
 data


sources
 that
 are
 difficult
 to
 verify.


They
 painfully
 prepare
 analyses
 and
 tick


through
 models
 sell
 by
 cell


and
 they
 manually
 prepare
 investment


memos
 and
 pitch
 decks
 often
 pulling


allnighters
 on
 a
 tight
 deal
 timeline.


With
 Claude,
 we
 can
 start
 to
 address
 all


of
 these
 pain
 points.


Now,
 let's
 show
 you
 what
 that
 looks
 like


in
 action.


Meet
 Sarah,
 a
 hedge
 fun
 at
 Acme
 Capital.


It's
 2
 p.m.
 Her
 portfolio
 manager
 burst


into
 her
 office
 with
 an
 urgent
 question,


which
 I
 think
 many
 of
 you
 know
 well.


Our
 target
 company,
 Velocity
 Athletic,


reported
 terrible
 earnings
 yesterday.


revenue
 is
 down
 12%.
 But
 somehow
 the


stock
 price
 is
 up
 17%.


Trading
 at
 $71
 per
 share.


But
 PM
 needs
 to
 know,
 is
 this
 rally


justified
 by
 their
 new
 strategy
 or


should
 they
 sell
 into
 the
 spike?
 And
 he


needs
 an
 answer
 before
 the
 market


closes.


Now,
 let
 me
 show
 you
 how
 clot
 transforms


this
 typical
 four
 to
 five
 hour
 scramble


into
 analysis
 under
 30
 minutes.


First,
 Sarah
 connects
 her
 tools.
 Look
 at


what
 is
 available
 in
 one
 workspace.
 All


the
 tools
 she
 works
 in
 S&P
 Global,


Morning
 Star,
 Faxet,
 Dupa,
 and
 even
 her


firm's
 internal
 box
 documents.


No
 more
 juggling
 14
 different
 browser


tabs.
 Everything
 she
 needs
 is
 right
 here


with
 unified
 access.


Sarah
 starts
 a
 comprehensive
 query


asking
 claw
 to
 pull
 from
 multiple
 data


sources
 simultaneously.


Watch
 what
 happens.
 Cloud
 orchestrates


across
 platforms.
 S&P
 Global
 for


transcripts,
 Morning
 Star
 for
 reports,


Box
 for
 internal
 analyses,
 the
 Loopa


pulling
 eight
 quarters
 of
 financials.


And
 here's
 the
 key.
 Sarah
 gets


synthesized
 intelligence,
 not
 just
 raw


data
 dumps.
 Output


full
 earnings
 transcript
 analysis
 with


red
 flags
 from
 Q&A.
 The
 CFO
 disclosing
 a


400
 basis
 point
 margin
 hit
 from
 the


tariffs.
 Competitors
 look
 like
 they're


doing
 better.
 Pace
 running
 has
 been
 in


Vietnam
 since
 2019.


And
 most
 importantly,
 you
 can
 see
 full


financials
 linked
 to
 the
 original
 data


source
 like
 we're
 seeing
 here
 with
 the


Loopa.
 So
 Sarah
 can
 verify
 the
 results


instantaneously.


To
 go
 deeper,
 Sarah
 asked
 Claude
 to


create
 visualizations
 and
 specific


analyses
 like
 an
 annotated
 stock
 price


chart,
 comps
 and
 benchmarking
 analyses,


and
 even
 discounted
 cash
 flow
 model.


As
 you
 can
 see,
 Claude
 is
 now
 pulling


key
 corporate
 events
 from
 SEC
 Edgar
 and


the
 web,


price
 data
 from
 S&P
 Global,


historical
 financials
 from
 DOUPA,


consensus
 estimates
 from
 fact
 set
 and


creates
 several
 visual
 artifacts.


First,
 an
 event
 annotated
 stock
 price


chart
 showing
 the
 17
 SP
 percent
 spike


with
 all
 key
 events
 marked.


Emergency
 board
 meeting,
 CFO
 stock
 sale,


earnings
 surprise.


Next,
 a
 comprehensive
 comps
 table.


Velocity
 is
 trading
 at
 21
 times
 IBIDA


against
 peers
 at
 16
 times
 despite
 having


worse
 fundamentals.


And
 here
 is
 where
 it
 gets
 powerful.


Claude
 has
 built
 a
 fully
 auditable


discounted
 cash
 flow
 model


with
 a
 functional
 case
 selector,


projections
 tied
 to
 assumptions,
 and


even
 a
 perfect
 whack
 calculation
 without


needing
 to
 be
 prompted.


Now,
 this
 DCF
 model
 projects
 a
 base


price
 of
 $54,
 suggesting
 that
 perhaps


$71
 is
 overly
 optimistic.


Finally,
 Sarah
 actually
 needs
 to
 prepare


a
 deliverable
 for
 her
 PM.
 She
 asks


Claude
 to
 create
 an
 investment
 memo


using
 her
 firm's
 templates
 from
 Box.


Claude
 searches
 Box
 for
 any
 relevant


internal
 information,


including
 a
 memo
 template
 and
 any
 past


eventdriven
 trades
 as
 reference.


In
 seconds,
 she
 has
 a
 professional
 memo


with
 an
 exact
 sum
 recommendation
 to
 fade


the
 rally,


clear
 rationale
 with
 supporting
 data
 for


market
 performance
 and
 comps,


and
 specific
 action
 items
 and
 risk


analyses,
 all
 properly
 cited.


The
 bottom
 line,
 the
 market
 is


overpricing
 a
 complex
 operational


challenge.
 So,
 take
 profits
 now,
 buy
 it


back
 later,
 cheaper.


Now,
 let's
 recap
 what
 just
 happened


here.
 Sarah
 delivered
 institutional


quality
 analyses
 in
 under
 30
 minutes,
 a


typical
 process
 that
 takes
 3
 to
 five


hours
 across
 multiple
 platforms.
 So,
 she


didn't
 just
 save
 time,
 she
 uncovered


insights
 she
 might
 have
 missed
 like
 the


CFO
 sale
 or
 the
 competitor's
 existing


advantages.


Now,
 we
 believe
 this
 is
 the
 future
 of


financial
 analysis
 where
 AI
 fully


augments
 and
 an
 analyst
 capabilities


where
 the
 best
 insights
 across
 all
 of


the
 platforms
 come
 together
 in
 one


intelligent
 workspace.


Now
 one
 example
 of
 these
 capabilities


coming
 to
 life
 is
 from
 the
 Norwegian


sovereign
 wealth
 fund
 otherwise
 known
 as


MBIN
 the
 largest
 sovereign
 wealth
 fund


in
 the
 world


to
 share
 a
 quote
 from
 their
 CEO
 Nikolai


Claude
 has
 fundamentally
 transformed
 the


way
 we
 work
 at
 NBIM


they've
 achieved
 20%
 productivity
 gains


that
 is
 213,000


hours
 back
 a
 here
 to
 focus
 on
 what


really
 matters


that
 is
 better
 decisions
 and
 returns
 for


the
 Norwegian
 people.


As
 Nikolai
 put
 it,
 Claude
 has
 become


indispensable.


Now,
 building
 these
 solutions
 requires


deep
 partnership
 with
 all
 of
 you.


Everyone
 in
 attendance
 today
 will


receive
 a
 one
 month
 free
 trial
 to
 the


solution.


I
 am
 personally
 very
 excited
 to
 spend


much
 more
 time
 with
 all
 of
 you
 to
 dive


deeper
 into
 the
 problems
 we
 can
 solve


together
 and
 to
 shape
 the
 future
 of


financial
 services
 with
 both
 our


products
 and
 model
 capabilities.


And
 with
 that,
 I'll
 pass
 it
 to
 my


colleague
 Jonathan
 Pelosi,
 our
 head
 of


financial
 services,
 and
 our


distinguished
 panel
 of
 industry
 leaders


to
 share
 their
 own
 journeys
 with
 Claude.


[Music]


Thank
 you,
 Nick,
 and
 to
 the
 DJ.
 Well,
 I


didn't
 choose
 that
 song.
 I
 love
 it.
 Let


me
 put
 these
 down.
 And
 thank
 you
 to


everybody
 for
 joining
 us.


Hopefully
 you
 get
 a
 sense
 of
 why
 we're


so
 optimistic
 about
 being
 able
 to


support
 every
 one
 of
 you
 and
 everyone
 of


you
 dialed
 in


on
 all
 of
 your
 tasks
 as
 it
 relates
 to


financial
 analysis.
 But
 don't
 just
 take


my
 word
 for
 it.
 I've
 got
 a
 much
 more


impressive
 panel
 that
 can
 speak
 to
 what


they're
 doing
 with
 this
 type
 of


technology
 and
 how
 they're
 doing
 it.
 And


as
 Nick
 alluded
 to,
 in
 my
 role


overseeing
 all
 financial
 services
 for


Anthropic,


that
 effectively
 means
 we
 support
 the


biggest
 banks
 and
 insurance
 companies,


hedge
 funds,
 and
 asset
 managers
 in


taking
 this
 technology
 and
 practically


applying
 it
 to
 your
 firm
 in
 a
 way
 where


you
 can
 use
 it
 to
 drive
 real
 value
 and


real
 transformation.
 And
 I
 say


practically
 because
 all
 too
 often


we'll
 read
 about
 the
 theoretical


headlines
 of
 what
 this
 stuff
 can
 do
 and


you're
 like,
 "Oh,
 it'll
 transform
 the


way
 we
 work
 and
 it'll
 improve


productivity
 by
 50%."


But
 by
 the
 time
 my
 team
 and
 I
 sit
 with


you,
 we
 often
 pull
 back
 the
 layers
 and


say,
 "Well,
 how
 do
 you
 actually
 make


that
 happen?
 How
 do
 you
 actually


tailor
 this
 to
 your
 organization?
 How
 do


you
 actually
 work
 on
 change
 management?"


getting
 these
 individuals
 comfortable


with
 using
 this
 technology.


Those
 are
 the
 types
 of
 things
 we
 obsess


over
 and
 the
 types
 of
 things
 we're


excited
 to
 chat
 further
 about.
 So,
 with


that
 said,
 I'm
 going
 to
 call
 up
 my


esteemed
 panel.
 If
 you
 could
 come
 on


down
 and
 give
 them
 a
 chance
 to
 introduce


themselves.


[Music]


Thank
 you,
 team.
 We're
 going
 to
 do
 quick


intros
 uh
 because
 I
 don't
 think
 the


titles
 necessarily
 do
 justice
 to
 all
 of


the
 AI
 work
 they
 do.
 And
 we're
 going
 to


start
 with
 my
 good
 friend
 Michael
 here.


Take
 it
 away.


>> Thanks
 JP.
 Uh
 my
 name
 is
 Michael.
 I


co-head
 the
 COO
 group
 at
 uh
 DE
 Shaw.


That
 means
 is
 my
 team
 and
 I
 uh
 work
 on


big
 firmwide
 transformation
 initiatives.


And
 there
 is
 no
 bigger
 firmwide


challenge
 and
 opportunity
 that
 we're


spending
 time
 on
 uh
 right
 now
 than
 AI.


Thank
 you,
 Michael
 Lloyd.
 Thanks,
 JP.


Lloyd
 Hilton.
 I
 am
 an
 AI
 lead
 at
 HD


Capital.
 So,
 for
 those
 of
 you
 who
 don't


know
 us,
 we
 are
 a
 major
 PE
 firm,
 one
 of


the
 top
 10
 largest
 globally.
 And
 we're
 a


sector
 specialist.
 So,
 we
 have
 about
 50


portfolio
 companies
 in
 the
 B2B
 SAS
 and


services
 space.
 Um,
 and
 we've
 been


driving
 a
 major
 transformation
 effort


with
 those
 portfolio
 companies
 for
 the


last
 two
 and
 a
 half
 years
 now,


partnering
 with
 the
 anthropic
 team.


>> Don,


>> morning
 everyone.
 Thanks
 for
 having
 us


JP.
 My
 name
 is
 Don
 Vu.
 I'm
 the
 chief


data
 analytics
 officer
 at
 New
 York
 Life.


For
 those
 that
 aren't
 familiar
 with
 New


York
 Life,
 we're
 Fortune
 69,
 over
 a


trillion
 dollars
 of
 insurance
 in
 force.


Um,
 and
 we're
 one
 of the
 largest


insurance
 companies
 in
 the
 world.
 I'm


responsible
 for
 our
 overarching
 AI
 and


data
 strategy
 and
 its
 execution.


>> Thank
 you,
 Don.
 And
 Frod,
 last
 but
 not


least.


>> Yes.
 So,
 my
 name
 is
 Frod.
 Uh,
 I
 am
 I'm


part
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth


Fund.
 We
 are
 a
 $2
 trillion
 sovereign


wealth
 fund.
 uh
 and
 uh
 70%
 uh
 equities,


30%
 uh
 fixed
 income
 and
 and
 bonds.
 And


we
 are
 only
 700
 employees
 worldwide.
 So


we
 have
 um
 uh
 a
 single
 owner,
 the


Minister
 of
 Finance
 who
 represents
 the


Norwegian
 people
 and
 I'm
 part
 of
 uh
 the


team
 here
 in
 North
 America
 that
 manages


the
 bulk
 of
 the
 equity
 assets.


>> Thank
 you,
 Fro.
 F
 and
 I
 were
 chatting


earlier
 and
 I
 think
 the
 stat
 I
 think
 has


to
 be
 true
 that
 per
 employee
 no


organization
 manages
 more
 money
 on
 earth


than
 MBIM.
 So
 it's
 it's
 an
 impressive


stat
 indeed.
 And
 for
 those
 in
 the


audience
 we'll
 have
 a
 chance
 for
 you
 to


ask
 questions
 as
 well
 after


I
 ask
 a
 couple
 to
 the
 panelists.
 So
 keep


that
 in
 mind.
 Uh
 we're
 really
 looking


forward
 to
 hearing
 from
 you
 as
 well.
 But


let's
 start


the
 AI
 AI
 investment
 thesis.
 Naturally,


your
 big
 organizations,
 complicated


firms,


at
 what
 point
 did
 this
 decision
 to
 go


allin
 and
 do
 this
 at
 like
 a
 firmwide


level
 take
 place
 and
 who
 drove
 that?
 And


for
 this,
 we'll
 start
 with
 road.
 I'm


curious
 to
 hear
 from
 you.


>> Yeah,
 sure.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 our
 AI
 strategy


is
 really
 to
 be
 a
 leading
 user
 of
 AI
 in


investment
 management.
 Uh,
 and
 that
 just


means
 embedding
 AI
 into
 everything
 I
 do,


I
 think,
 in
 in
 a
 in
 a
 responsible
 way.


Um
 so
 that
 means
 uh
 creating
 efficiency


gains,
 reducing
 costs,
 uh
 enhancing


returns
 and
 really
 improving
 risk


management.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 what's


changed
 is
 that
 we
 have
 a
 coordinated


strategy
 with
 really
 dedicated
 dedicated


organizational
 support
 um
 and
 a


dedicated
 AI
 team
 that
 uh
 helps
 out
 in


in
 the
 organization
 and
 this
 is
 really


driven
 from
 the
 top
 right.
 So
 it's
 uh
 we


have
 this
 AI
 maniac
 at
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the


fund
 uh
 Nikolai
 Tongen
 and
 uh
 he
 is
 just


all
 in
 on
 uh
 on
 on
 the
 change
 that
 we


see
 in
 society
 right
 so
 his
 leadership


his
 enthusiasm
 about
 AI
 is
 really
 really


setting
 the
 scene
 internally
 in
 the
 fund


and
 and
 driving
 the
 cultural
 adaptation


that
 we
 see
 I
 think
 that's
 just


absolutely
 crucial


>> thank
 you
 fro
 and
 not
 surprisingly
 this


kind
 of
 top
 down
 buyin
 is
 critical
 if


you're
 trying
 to
 drive
 adoption
 and


really
 meaningful
 change
 across
 the


Oregon.
 I
 think
 the
 frozen
 Nikolai
 has


done
 an
 amazing
 job
 of
 that.
 Lloyd,
 how


about
 you
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 to
 your
 firm


both
 internally
 and
 with
 your
 portfolio


companies?


>> Yeah,
 so
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 that
 the
 top


down
 buyin
 really
 resonates
 for
 for
 us


as
 well.
 Um
 so
 although
 we
 are


investors,
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 leadership
 team


are
 sort
 of
 technologists
 um
 and


engineers.
 Um,
 so
 very
 early
 on
 I
 think


we
 sort
 of
 recognized
 that
 this
 was
 a


platform
 shift.
 Um,
 a
 lot
 of
 HG's


success
 has
 been
 predicated
 based
 on


helping
 our
 portfolio
 companies
 navigate


the
 sort
 of
 on-prem
 to
 SAS
 platform


shift.
 Um,
 we've
 also
 been
 investing
 in


AI
 for
 a
 while.
 So
 we
 have
 a
 central


data
 team.
 Uh,
 we
 actually
 had
 access
 to


GPT3
 back
 in
 2021.
 Um
 so
 we
 we've
 been


experimenting
 with
 this
 for
 a
 while
 and


I
 guess
 when
 um
 you
 know
 the
 early
 LMS


were
 sort
 of
 launched
 around
 2022
 2023


we
 realized
 this
 was
 a
 pretty
 major


opportunity.
 Um
 I
 think
 for
 us
 though


you
 know
 people
 find
 conviction
 at
 their


own
 pace
 and
 what
 really
 helped
 was
 we


ran
 an
 event
 in
 Silicon
 Valley
 so
 we


worked
 with
 the
 anthropic
 team.
 We


actually
 had
 Mike
 Creger
 the
 CPO
 come
 to


speak
 at
 that
 event
 and
 we've
 fully


immersed
 our
 execs
 in
 this
 AI
 topic
 and


got
 people
 really
 hands-on.
 So
 for
 us


that
 was
 a
 that
 was
 a
 real
 catalyst.
 Um,


and
 I
 guess
 over
 the
 last
 two
 years,
 the


thing
 that's
 really
 surprised
 us
 is
 just


how
 quickly
 this
 has
 moved.
 So,
 we


started
 probably
 thinking
 about,
 oh
 no,


we
 can
 get
 10
 to
 20%
 productivity
 gains


through
 integrating
 AI
 into
 our
 existing


processes.
 What
 we're
 now
 really
 focused


on
 is
 fully
 transforming
 our
 portfolio


companies
 with
 with
 AI.
 And
 we
 think


that
 there's
 going to
 be
 a
 huge
 amount


of
 value
 uh
 upside
 for
 us
 and
 for
 our


portfolio
 companies
 through
 through


doing
 that.
 So,
 that's
 really
 where
 the


the
 focus
 is
 now.
 Um,
 and
 we've
 kind
 of


replicated
 that
 same
 approach.
 So,
 you


know,
 we
 got
 that
 top
 down
 buy
 in


centrally
 for
 HG.
 We're
 now
 making
 sure


that
 we
 uh
 create
 that
 same
 catalyst
 and


that
 same
 spark
 for
 our
 for
 our


portfolio
 companies
 and
 we're
 finding


that
 sort
 of
 now
 permeating
 pretty


nicely
 through
 the
 HG
 portfolio
 to
 drive


that
 that
 transformational
 change.


>> Fantastic.
 Thank
 you,
 Lloyd.
 And
 for
 the


folks
 in
 the
 audience,
 I
 can
 imagine


this
 is
 something
 on
 your
 mind
 and
 for


those
 dialing
 in.
 All
 too
 often
 we
 hear,


you
 know,
 should
 I
 build
 this
 internally


or
 should
 I
 buy
 something
 out
 of
 the
 box


with
 APIs
 now,
 it's
 increasingly
 easy
 to


build
 really
 bespoke
 AI
 powered


solutions.
 And
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 great
 solutions
 out
 of
 the
 box.


Nicklin
 just
 walked
 through
 one
 with
 you


today.
 So
 with
 that
 said,
 we'll
 start


with
 you,
 Don.
 How
 do
 you
 think
 about


this
 notion
 of
 build
 versus
 buy
 and


basically
 deciding
 which
 path
 to
 go?
 Do


you
 go
 both?
 Walk
 us
 through
 that


thought
 process.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 No,
 I
 think it's
 a
 great


question.
 I
 think
 when
 we
 first
 started


this
 generative
 AI
 wave,
 a
 lot of


organizations,
 especially
 financial


services
 companies
 uh
 went
 through
 a


decision
 like
 should
 we
 leverage
 uh
 APIs


and
 build
 our
 own
 custom
 rappers
 or


should
 we
 partner
 with
 a
 company
 like


Anthropic
 and
 leverage
 like
 these


enterprise
 solutions?
 There's
 obviously


trade-offs
 with
 those.
 I
 think
 um
 for
 us


we
 were
 actually
 very
 intentional
 that


you
 know
 continuing
 to
 it
 innovate
 on


the
 UI
 layer
 and
 all
 these
 different


sort
 of
 capabilities
 like
 canvas
 uh
 and


things
 of
 that
 nature
 connectors
 etc
 etc


was
 going
 to
 be
 really
 challenging
 right


I
 think
 uh
 companies
 like
 anthropic
 are


just
 moving
 at
 such
 incredible
 velocity


with
 respect
 to
 innovation
 uh
 we
 wanted


to
 ensure
 that
 our
 internal
 developers


and
 engineers
 were
 focused
 on
 our
 most


you
 know
 proprietary
 and
 specific
 uh


organizational
 solutions
 so
 For
 us,
 it


made
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 to
 more
 so
 partner


versus
 try
 to
 build
 our
 own
 custom
 ones


and
 let's
 leave
 like
 the
 custom


integrations
 and
 solutions
 for
 those


things
 that
 are
 really
 important
 for
 us


competitively.


>> Thanks,
 Donna.
 And
 Michael,
 how
 do
 you


guys
 think
 about
 that
 at
 Daw?


>> So,


for
 those
 in
 the
 hedge
 fund
 industry
 at


least,
 I
 think
 we're
 pretty
 well
 known


for
 having
 a
 big
 focus
 on
 building


things.
 uh
 we
 hire
 amazing
 technologists


and
 we
 give
 them
 the
 opportunity
 to


build
 great
 things.
 And
 so
 the
 instinct


when
 something
 comes
 along
 for
 us
 is
 to


build
 the
 best
 version
 of
 it
 ourselves.


But
 resources
 aren't
 infinite
 and
 with


great
 people
 comes
 big
 opportunity
 cost.


And
 so
 we
 always
 think
 hard
 about
 build


versus
 buy.


What
 I
 think
 is
 different
 this
 time
 and


I
 think
 Don
 alluded
 to
 it
 is
 the
 speed


at
 which
 the
 technology
 is
 changing
 and


with
 that
 speed
 comes
 a
 different


balance
 between
 uh
 build
 and
 buy.
 uh
 to


be
 able
 to
 build
 and
 deploy
 at
 that


speed
 and
 scale
 that
 some
 of
 what's


being
 offered
 in
 the
 commercial
 market


can
 provide
 uh
 is
 often
 somewhere


between
 difficult
 and
 impossible


internally.
 So
 that
 shifts
 our
 calculus.


Uh
 we're
 still
 doing
 both
 and
 we're


being
 extraordinarily
 deliberate
 in
 h


where
 we
 choose
 to
 build
 and
 where
 we


choose
 to
 buy.


>> Fantastic.
 And
 yeah,
 we
 hear
 that


So
 often
 as
 well
 when
 they'll
 develop
 a


partner
 will
 develop
 an
 internal
 AI
 chat


and
 they'll
 share
 a
 feature
 that
 they're


particularly
 proud
 of
 and
 by
 the
 time
 we


meet
 with
 them
 you're
 almost
 you
 know


afraid
 to
 let
 them
 know
 it's
 like
 that's


already
 a
 thing
 of
 the
 past
 and
 look
 at


this
 this
 and
 this
 that's
 that's
 already


been
 developed.
 So
 I
 could
 couldn't


agree
 more.
 Recognizing
 you're
 all
 big


firms
 and
 leaders
 in
 your
 respective


spaces.
 Another
 huge
 challenge
 we
 hear


about
 is
 this
 change
 management
 and


driving
 this
 kind
 of
 transformation
 at


scale.
 It's
 one
 thing
 that
 this


technology
 can
 do
 cool
 stuff.
 How
 do
 you


actually
 get
 people
 using
 it?
 So
 when


you
 think
 of
 like
 transformation
 of
 the


size
 that
 you're
 operating
 at?
 And
 Don,


I'll
 start
 with
 you.
 Obviously
 got
 a
 lot


of
 employees.


>> How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 like
 practically


driving
 adoption
 with
 technology
 like


this
 when
 you've
 got
 so
 many
 different


departments
 employees
 to
 to
 think
 about?


Yeah,
 I
 know
 for
 us
 our
 AI
 strategy
 has


been
 pretty
 everything
 everywhere
 all
 at


once.
 So
 we
 actually
 um
 treat
 our
 AI


strategy
 as
 a
 as
 a
 portfolio
 of


initiatives.
 So
 I
 think
 we
 started
 with


like
 a
 lot
 of
 folks
 on
 targeted
 use


cases
 specific
 to
 workflows
 or
 certain


business
 domains.
 We
 had
 measurable


value
 in
 production
 and
 that
 was
 great.


We
 certainly
 realized
 that
 um
 we
 wanted


to
 raise
 the
 floor
 and
 the
 ceiling
 of


our
 aspirations
 by
 really
 democratizing


and
 empower
 all
 of
 our
 employees
 with
 AI


tools.
 And
 so
 there's
 multiple
 tools


that
 we're
 really
 um
 leveraging
 to
 do


that.
 And
 then
 we're
 actually
 also


focusing
 on
 reinvention.
 So
 like


business
 leaders
 at
 the
 top
 are
 really


looking
 at
 each
 of
 their
 respective


domains
 to
 understand
 how
 AI,
 agentic
 AI


and
 these
 new
 paradigms
 can
 actually


help
 us
 re-anchor
 our
 aspirations
 of
 how


we
 can
 transform
 and
 the
 velocity
 for
 us


to
 do
 it.
 And
 so
 for
 us
 to
 do
 that,
 I


mean,
 again,
 very
 very
 pervasive,
 tons


of
 hands-on
 um
 uh
 training
 and
 uh


hackathons,
 all
 these
 different
 things


that
 you
 actually
 have
 to
 do
 like
 get
 in


the
 trenches
 to
 really
 help
 people


understand
 what
 these
 possibilities
 are.


There's
 mindset
 shifts
 that
 are
 related


to
 that
 that
 I
 think
 maybe
 we'll
 touch


on
 later
 in
 the
 discussion.
 But
 it


really
 has
 been
 kind
 of a
 fullcourt


press
 that's
 complemented
 by
 both
 a


top-down
 commitment
 from
 our
 CEO
 and
 his


executive
 leaders,
 but
 again
 this


bottoms
 up
 sort
 of
 empowerment
 that
 uh


goes
 alongside
 that.


>> Thank
 you,
 Don.
 And
 Lloyd,
 you
 have
 a


bit
 of
 a
 different
 challenge
 and
 you're


working
 with
 the
 employees
 internally,


but
 also
 of
 course
 the
 portfolios
 that


you
 that
 you
 support.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 guys


think
 about
 scaling
 this
 and
 driving


that
 transformation
 at
 the
 portfolio


level
 realizing
 that's
 a
 lot
 of


different
 companies
 you
 got
 to
 help


train
 and
 educate?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 for
 sure.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 you
 said
 resonates,


Don.
 So,
 we
 we
 have
 50
 companies,
 about


120,000
 FTE
 across
 those
 companies.
 All


of
 our
 companies
 look
 a
 little
 bit


similar
 and
 and
 mostly,
 you
 know,


verticalized
 software
 platforms.
 Um,
 so


what
 that's
 enabled
 us
 to
 do
 is
 really


sort
 of
 bring
 transformation
 at
 scale
 to


that
 group.
 So,
 that
 starts
 with
 a


central
 effort
 from
 HG.
 We
 have
 20
 AI


specialists
 internally
 supported
 by


about
 150
 or
 so
 kind
 of
 contractors
 and


close
 partners.
 Um,
 and
 we've
 been


really
 driving
 that
 that
 central
 change


um
 across
 the
 portfolio.
 Um
 it's
 also


allowed
 us
 to
 experiment
 with
 lots
 of


different
 tools,
 lots
 of
 different


initiatives
 and
 really
 see
 what
 works


quickly
 across
 that
 sort
 of
 laboratory


and
 you
 know
 understand
 what
 the
 best


processes
 are.
 Um
 but
 I
 think
 the
 yeah


the
 top
 down
 point
 has
 been
 absolutely


critical.
 So
 we've
 been
 kind
 of


systematically
 uh
 working
 with
 each
 of


the
 leaders
 of
 our
 portfolio
 getting


them
 engaged
 getting
 them
 hands-on
 and


then
 there's
 also
 um
 the
 piece
 I'd
 add


is
 that
 we
 we're
 really
 trying
 to
 be


disruptive
 in
 the
 way
 that
 we
 think


about
 this.
 So
 you
 know
 rather
 than


retrofitting
 existing
 processes
 and


adding
 some
 AI
 we've
 re-engineered
 a
 lot


of
 our
 our
 functions.
 So
 if
 I
 take


software
 engineering
 for
 example
 um
 on


average
 across
 the
 the
 portfolio
 we're


now
 measuring
 about
 30%
 productivity


gains
 in
 software
 engineering.
 We
 have


some
 companies
 who
 have
 taken
 their


development
 squads
 down
 from
 nine
 people


to
 two
 people.
 Um
 so
 getting
 really


material
 leverage.
 We
 have
 one
 company


that's
 deployed
 a
 thousand
 instances
 of


an
 Aentic
 software
 engineer.
 So
 they've


kind
 of
 added
 50%
 productive
 capacity
 to


their
 engineering
 team.
 Um
 and
 that's


the
 sort
 of
 reinvention
 that
 we're
 now


sort
 of
 driving
 out
 across
 across
 the


portfolio.
 Um
 I
 should
 say
 there
 what


what
 we're
 not
 doing
 is
 you
 know
 taking


out
 any
 cost.
 What
 we're
 doing
 is
 then


rein
 uh
 reinvesting
 in
 um
 productivity


um
 basically
 clearing
 down
 tech
 debt
 and


also
 building
 AI
 products.
 And
 that's


the
 other
 key
 focus
 for
 us
 where
 we're


seeing
 you
 know
 a
 huge
 amount
 of


transformational
 value
 through
 embedding


um
 the
 anthropic
 API
 but
 other
 solutions


as
 well
 into
 into
 our
 core
 uh
 software


solutions.
 And
 that's
 adding
 material


growth
 to
 some
 of
 our
 businesses


already.


>> Thank
 you,
 Lloyd.
 And
 on
 the
 topic
 of


change
 management,
 this
 also
 comes
 up
 a


lot


with
 our
 partners.
 How
 do
 you
 think


about,
 hey,
 this
 technology,
 there's
 a


lot
 about
 that
 scares
 me
 and
 my


employees
 might
 interpret
 this
 as


something
 that
 could
 do
 their
 work.
 and


how
 do
 you
 tow
 the
 line
 there
 in


empowering
 them
 to
 use
 it
 while
 also


recognizing
 that
 there's
 some
 fear
 on
 is


this
 going
 to
 kind
 of
 do
 my
 my
 job
 for


me.
 So
 we
 we
 we
 think
 about
 like
 the


cultural
 implications
 at
 the
 firm
 and


how
 do
 you
 make
 this
 a
 part
 of
 the


culture
 and
 so
 fro
 this
 one's
 for
 you


because
 I
 think
 mim's
 done
 a
 masterful


job
 navigating
 this
 how
 do
 you


and
 I
 guess
 starting
 from
 Nikolai
 but
 as


you
 as
 a
 senior
 portfolio
 manager
 and


your
 teams
 how
 do
 you
 see
 this
 fitting


into
 the
 culture
 of
 the
 firm
 and


becoming
 just
 a
 core
 part
 of
 how
 you


guys
 operate?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 starting
 with


a
 top
 down
 perspective
 obviously
 very


important
 right
 I
 mean
 that's
 uh
 really


driven
 it
 and
 I
 think
 we
 had
 uh
 focus
 on


tech
 for
 a
 long
 time
 we've
 been
 a
 very


techdriven
 organization
 now
 we
 we've


taken
 a
 journey
 from
 moving
 from
 uh
 our


infrastructure
 to
 the
 cloud
 uh
 having
 uh


data
 on
 snowflake
 u
 integrating
 cloud


for
 enterprise
 and
 being
 able
 to
 really


chat
 with
 our
 data
 and
 that
 fits
 very


well
 with
 our
 quantitative
 nature
 and


our
 inclination
 to
 use
 data
 right
 so
 I


think
 from
 a
 culture
 perspective
 is
 a


very
 good
 fit
 and
 um
 uh
 I'd
 say
 in
 my


team
 for
 instance
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 are


really
 introverted
 right
 and
 uh
 we
 we


like
 to
 sit
 on
 and
 and
 uh
 and
 code
 and


and
 do
 things
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 just
 having


claude
 and
 having
 the
 projects
 that
 we


can
 now
 build
 assistance
 and
 just
 share


and
 collaborate
 on
 it
 is
 just
 uh
 really


accelerating
 the
 the
 cultural
 shift
 that


we're
 seeing
 organizations
 I
 think


that's
 super
 fascinating
 and
 I'll
 also


add
 that
 being
 a
 sovereign
 we belt
 fund


with
 a
 single
 owner
 it's
 just
 having
 AI


into
 the
 organization
 is
 just
 such
 a


massive
 enabler
 for
 us,
 right?
 Because


we
 can
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 with
 this


technology
 that
 others
 just
 can't,


right?
 Because
 we're
 not
 hampered
 with,


you
 know,
 uh
 client
 and
 and
 customer


dynamics.
 So,
 we
 can
 we
 have
 a
 really


open
 uh
 and
 and
 lean
 organization
 with
 a


collaborative
 culture
 and
 uh
 we're
 just


700.
 So,
 this
 is
 just
 fascinating.


>> Fantastic.
 Thank
 you,
 F.
 really
 I
 really


appreciate
 that
 this
 idea
 of
 like


demystifying
 what
 this
 technology
 is
 all


about
 at
 the
 individual
 employee
 level


is
 so
 critical
 because
 so
 quickly
 you


can
 address
 those
 concerns
 or
 fears
 at


you
 know
 a
 cultural
 level
 because
 very


quickly
 they
 see
 oh
 this
 is
 just
 a
 great


assistant
 if
 you
 will
 it's
 a
 great


partner
 when
 I
 wake
 up
 and
 I
 start
 my


role
 in
 helping
 me
 do
 my
 work
 more


effectively
 so
 it's
 wonderful
 to
 hear


that
 example


>> yeah
 I
 think
 JP
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 great


point
 I
 think
 we
 were
 actually
 very


intentional.
 I
 think
 very
 early
 on
 in


this
 journey,
 folks
 would
 talk
 about,


you
 know,
 AI
 is
 not
 going
 to
 take
 your


job,
 but
 someone
 using
 AI
 will.
 And
 so


we
 wanted
 to
 really,
 you
 know,
 address


that
 head-on
 and
 ensure
 that
 as
 many


employees
 as
 possible.
 And
 we
 were


intentional
 about
 every
 employee
 having


multiple
 AI
 solutions
 and
 then
 not
 just


that,
 but
 getting
 like
 the
 training


involved
 to
 help
 them
 feel
 even
 more


empowered.
 Um,
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 really


critical
 to
 your
 point
 to
 like
 get


through
 some
 of
 the
 call
 it
 the
 FUD
 that


might
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 headwind.


>> Awesome.
 Thank
 you,
 Don.


>> Yeah.
 And
 oftentimes
 I'll
 I'll
 laugh


because
 even
 when
 partners
 ask
 like,
 you


know,
 how
 do
 I
 train?
 How
 do
 I
 build


these
 curriculums
 to
 drive
 adoption?


I'll
 pause
 and
 I'll
 be
 like,
 ask
 Claude.


And
 jokes
 aside,
 whether
 it's
 Claude
 or


another
 tool
 you're
 using,
 these
 tools


are
 very
 good
 at
 that
 sort
 of
 task.


We're
 like,
 here's
 my
 firm.
 And
 for


those
 dialing
 in,
 same
 applies.
 Here's


my
 size.
 Here's
 what
 we
 do.
 I
 want
 to


build
 a
 simple
 training
 program
 for
 my


employees.
 Maybe
 they've
 got
 three
 hours


they'll
 spend
 over
 the
 next
 two
 weeks.


How
 would
 you
 break
 it
 up?
 What
 would


that
 training
 look
 like?
 I'm
 telling


you,
 if
 you
 do
 that
 exercise
 when
 you
 go


home,
 it'll
 be
 a
 beautiful,
 beautiful


output.


>> Can
 I
 give
 you
 a
 double
 down
 on
 that?


>> Yes.


>> Uh
 if
 your
 staff
 say,
 "I
 don't
 know
 what


to
 do.
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 to
 start."


Tell
 them
 to
 describe
 their
 job
 briefly.


And
 ask
 the
 AI,
 how
 ought
 I
 start


working
 with
 this?
 what
 are
 a
 few
 things


I
 can
 try?
 It
 uh
 it
 actually
 works


wonders.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 love
 that
 example
 because
 I'll


even
 go
 so
 far
 as
 to
 say
 I've
 got
 two


little
 kids,
 for
 instance,
 a
 four
 and
 a


two-year-old.
 And
 if
 I'm
 looking
 for
 an


activity
 to
 do
 on
 the
 weekend,
 I'm
 not


very
 good
 at
 coming
 up
 with
 those.
 But


I'll
 ask
 Claude,
 but
 I'll
 do
 one
 better.


I'll
 be
 like,
 "Claude,
 I
 want
 you
 to


optimize
 the
 following
 prompt."
 And
 I'll


be
 like, "I
 need
 to
 come
 up
 with


activities
 for
 my
 kids."
 And
 then
 Claude


will
 rewrite
 it.
 I'll
 copy
 paste
 it.
 and


then
 I
 get
 like
 the
 world's
 greatest


to-dos.
 Um,
 so
 that's
 that's
 another


good
 hack.
 Ask
 ask
 Claude
 to
 write
 your


prompts
 for
 you.
 But
 deciding
 where
 to


start
 is
 another
 thing
 we
 hear
 a
 lot


about,
 right?
 So
 for
 folks
 in
 the


audience,
 some
 of
 you
 are
 smaller
 firms,


a
 lot
 of
 your
 massive
 firms,
 but
 okay,


there's
 a
 lot.
 You've
 heard
 a
 lot
 from


this
 group.
 Transformation
 across
 the
 or


top
 down
 leadership.
 I'm
 going
 to
 start


with
 Michael
 again
 here.
 Where
 do
 you


for
 the
 folks
 in
 the
 audience
 if
 we
 have


to
 start
 somewhere
 like
 what's
 the
 use


case?
 what
 is
 the
 first
 place
 they
 start


if
 they're
 starting
 with
 a
 clean
 slate?


What
 would
 you
 suggest?


>> So,
 it's
 incredibly
 tempting
 to
 look
 for


a
 first
 place
 to
 start
 and
 my
 advice


would
 be
 to
 resist
 that
 temptation.


uh
 your


colleagues,


I
 don't
 know
 that
 they
 know
 uh
 more


about
 how
 best
 to
 use
 the
 tools.
 They


certainly
 don't
 before
 you
 give
 them
 the


tools,
 but
 once
 you
 give
 them
 the
 tools,


they
 will
 discover


uh
 things
 to
 do
 with
 those
 that
 you


never
 imagined.
 So,
 we're
 a
 pretty


decentralized
 place.
 We
 are
 a
 place
 that


wants
 to
 make
 every
 one
 of
 our


colleagues
 better
 using
 AI.
 So
 our
 core


focus
 off
 the
 bat
 and
 what
 I
 would


recommend
 to
 others
 is
 get
 really
 easy


to
 use
 tools
 out
 there.
 Let
 people


figure
 out
 what
 they're
 doing
 and
 then


pay
 attention.
 Help
 accelerate
 the


spread.
 in
 some
 cases
 centralized
 as
 you


learn
 uh
 but
 not
 as
 uh
 not
 as
 your
 first


step.
 I'll
 give
 one
 uh
 concrete
 piece
 of


advice
 on
 that.
 I
 think
 some
 people
 will


do
 that.
 They'll
 try
 something,
 it
 won't


work
 the
 way
 they'd
 like
 it
 to,
 and


they'll
 abandon
 it.
 What
 we
 found
 to
 be


valuable
 is
 to
 encourage
 folks
 to
 come


back,
 let's
 call
 it
 every
 six
 months.
 Uh


the
 rate
 at
 which
 the
 technology
 and
 the


products
 are
 changing
 is
 just
 foreign
 to


most
 of
 your
 colleagues
 and
 the
 degree


to
 which
 they
 can
 improve
 for
 a


particular
 use
 case
 in
 3
 months,
 6


months,
 9
 months
 uh
 can
 sometimes
 shock


them
 and
 so
 pushing
 them
 to
 revisit
 is


one
 play.
 We
 don't
 tend
 to
 be
 too
 pushy


but
 that's
 one
 place
 where
 I
 think


pushiness
 can
 pay
 off.
 So,
 I
 love
 that


because
 I
 think
 to
 Michael's
 point,
 I


want
 to
 hear
 from
 the
 from
 the
 rest
 of


the
 panel.
 The
 notion
 of
 starting
 with


one
 specific
 use
 case,
 oftentimes
 it
 can


be
 like,
 oh,
 I'm
 going
 to
 build
 a


bespoke
 analyst
 or
 risk
 mitigation


agent.


We'll
 always
 advise,
 similar
 to
 what


Michael
 said,
 first
 things
 first,
 get


this
 technology
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 your


employees
 in
 a
 safe,
 responsible
 way.


Obviously,
 you
 saw
 we
 have
 a
 solution.


There's
 there's
 many
 solutions
 out


there.
 And
 that
 should
 almost
 always
 be


step
 one
 because
 so
 often,
 and
 I
 imagine


this
 is
 true
 for
 everyone
 in
 the
 room.


It's
 only
 when
 you
 start
 using
 this


stuff.
 And
 honestly,
 that's
 true
 in
 your


personal
 life.
 It's
 true
 at
 work
 that


you
 really
 start
 to
 see
 what
 it's


capable
 of.
 I'm
 going
 through
 a
 process


today.
 I
 just
 bought
 a
 new
 house.
 I'm


getting
 home
 insurance.
 I
 don't
 know


when
 the
 last
 time
 you
 read
 a
 home


insurance
 policy
 was.
 They're
 brutal
 and


they're
 like
 400
 pages.
 and
 I
 get
 these


three
 policies
 and
 I'm
 like
 even


distilling
 the
 difference
 between


coverage
 and
 umbrellas
 and
 all
 that
 and


I
 work
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 insurance
 companies


so
 I
 should
 know
 all
 of
 this.
 I
 just


uploaded
 to
 Claude
 and
 I'd
 be
 like
 give


me
 a
 breakdown
 of
 like
 what
 I'm
 looking


at
 here
 and
 I'm
 sharing
 this
 as
 an


example
 because
 those
 same
 aha
 moments


and
 it
 gave
 me
 a
 wonderful
 answer.


the
 fastest
 way
 to
 create
 them
 is
 to


give
 your
 employees
 access
 to
 a
 tool


like
 Claude
 and
 there's
 again
 there's


there's
 other
 tools
 out
 there
 but
 just


to
 get
 it
 in
 their
 hands
 in
 a
 safe
 and


responsible
 way
 is
 is
 is
 huge.
 With
 that


said,
 um
 I
 want
 to
 go
 over
 to
 Lloyd
 as


you
 think
 about


advising
 this
 group
 on
 they've
 got


limited
 resources,
 limited
 people.
 Where


do
 they
 begin?
 Do
 you
 have
 any
 other


thoughts
 on
 where
 they
 should
 start?
 And


let's
 assume
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 this


they've
 already
 enabled
 a
 claude
 or
 an


AI
 tool
 at
 the
 employee
 level.
 What's


next?


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 so
 I
 was
 just
 going
 to
 add
 on


to
 on
 to
 Michael's
 point.
 I
 I
 fully


agree
 with,
 you
 know,
 revisiting
 the


technology
 every
 3
 to
 six
 months.
 The


other
 point
 I'd
 add
 is
 really
 investing


in
 your
 sort
 of
 prompt
 engineering
 or


context
 engineering.
 I
 think
 there's
 a


massive
 difference
 between
 a
 sort
 of


average
 user
 who
 puts
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 lazy


prompt
 into
 Claude
 versus
 someone
 who


really
 thinks
 about
 that
 context.
 So
 I


think
 finding
 those
 people
 who
 sort
 of


become
 power
 users
 in
 your
 organization


and
 just
 have
 a
 sort
 of
 natural


intuition
 for
 that
 can
 really
 help
 to


accelerate
 if
 you
 you
 know
 put
 those


people
 up
 as
 AI
 champions
 that
 can


really
 drive
 a
 lot
 of
 change.
 Um
 I
 guess


on
 other
 use
 cases
 once
 you've
 gone
 with


broad
 enablement
 um
 I
 mean
 the
 way
 we


think
 about
 that
 is
 looking
 at
 you
 know


those
 kind
 of
 high
 friction
 tasks
 where


people
 uh
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 mechanical


processing
 that
 are
 quite
 repeatable


that
 are
 using
 structured
 data.
 Those


are
 often
 sort
 of
 perfect
 candidates
 in


your
 organizations
 uh
 for
 something
 like


claude.
 So
 for
 us
 um
 you
 know
 for
 the


really
 critical
 decisions
 where
 it


requires
 a
 lot
 of
 sort
 of
 careful


thought
 and
 system
 two
 type
 thinking
 um


we
 maybe
 use
 claude
 as
 more
 of
 a


sounding
 board
 but
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 those


sort
 of
 mechanical
 uh
 tasks
 that
 happen


in
 all
 of
 our
 organizations
 it's
 kind
 of


using
 claude
 plus
 other
 automation
 tools


to
 really
 drive
 um
 yeah
 transformation


of
 of
 those
 processes
 is
 how
 how
 we


think
 about
 it.


>> Awesome.
 Thank
 you
 Lloyd.
 One
 of
 one
 of


my
 favorite
 questions
 to
 ask,
 so
 I'm


obviously
 going
 to
 ask
 it
 here.
 Uh,
 for


the
 purpose
 of
 the
 audience,
 all
 of
 you


have
 a
 lot
 of
 experience.
 You've
 kind
 of


gone
 through
 this.
 You've
 applied
 it
 in


your
 organization.
 You've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of


what
 works
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 doesn't.


I'm
 going
 to
 start
 with
 Frod.
 Um,


knowing
 what
 you
 know
 now,
 if
 you
 could


do
 it
 all
 over,
 what's
 one
 thing
 you


would
 do
 differently?


>> I
 don't
 know
 about
 what
 I
 would
 do


different
 really.
 I
 think
 in
 in
 Mim
 we


really
 nailed
 it
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 getting


it.
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 uh
 maybe
 just


start
 even
 uh
 even
 before
 right
 and
 uh


start
 right
 I
 mean
 that's
 what
 I
 would


say
 you
 know
 this
 is
 something
 you
 just


have
 to
 lean
 into
 and
 and
 and
 take
 take


on
 so
 I
 think
 um
 move
 fast
 and
 make


mistakes
 learn
 from
 them
 and
 move
 on
 is


really
 the
 the
 key
 takeaway
 and
 I
 think


if
 anything
 is
 just
 uh
 be
 there


>> thank
 you
 for
 Don
 how
 about
 you


>> yeah
 yeah
 I'll
 lean
 into
 the
 deep
 do


more
 faster
 bit
 but
 um
 I
 think
 one
 thing


we
 haven't
 touched
 on
 that
 I
 think
 that


we
 focused
 on
 but
 looking
 back
 perhaps


we
 could
 have
 focused
 on
 earlier
 was


this
 notion
 of
 it's
 a
 true
 like
 mindset


and
 culture
 shift.
 Um
 we
 talked
 a
 lot


about
 democratization
 and
 like
 a
 tool


roll
 out
 but
 certainly
 this
 is
 more
 than


just
 like
 rolling
 out
 tools
 and
 giving


people
 access.
 It's
 like
 giving
 everyone


in
 America
 a
 treadmill
 and
 expecting


like
 heart
 disease
 to
 be
 cured.
 Um
 what


we
 were
 very
 intentional
 about
 is


understanding
 that
 this
 is
 actually
 a


mindset
 shift
 as
 well.
 So
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 people
 look
 at
 like
 a
 claude
 or
 a


chatbt
 they
 see
 a
 text
 box
 and
 like
 oh


this
 is
 like
 Google
 I
 should
 just
 like


put
 in
 one
 question.
 I'm
 going
 to
 get


back
 an
 answer
 and
 then
 I'm
 kind
 of


done.
 I
 think
 the
 reality
 is
 the
 the


this
 technology
 is
 really
 designed
 to
 be


more
 of
 like
 a
 human.
 This
 truly
 is
 a


companion
 and
 a
 co-pilot,
 however
 you


might
 describe
 it.
 And
 so
 having
 a
 bit


of
 a
 mindset
 shift
 and
 actually
 helping


folks
 understand
 that,
 I
 think
 is
 really


critical.
 We've
 been
 really
 intentional


about
 partnering
 with
 um
 folks
 from
 the


outside
 to
 help
 our
 executives


especially
 on
 that
 journey.
 Um,
 one


analogy
 we've
 used
 is,
 you
 know,
 if


you're
 going
 to
 Costa
 Rica
 with
 your


family,
 you
 could
 go
 to
 Google
 and
 ask


for
 some
 recommendations
 or
 you
 could


just
 prompt
 Claude
 or
 Chat
 PT
 and
 say,


"Hey,
 you
 are
 the
 Costa
 Rica
 prime
 uh,


you
 know,
 head
 of
 tourism.
 I'm
 going
 to


Costa
 Rica
 with
 my
 family
 of
 four.
 My


kids
 are
 10
 and
 12.
 One
 likes
 surfing.


The
 other
 one
 likes,
 you
 know,
 wildlife.


Can
 you
 come
 up
 with
 a
 customized


itinerary?"
 And
 so
 that's
 that's
 a
 very


different
 sort
 of
 paradigm
 between
 those


two
 tools.
 And
 frankly,
 for
 most
 folks


that,
 you
 know,
 first
 start
 to
 engage,


that's
 kind
 of
 where
 they
 start.
 But
 we


think
 it's
 really
 important
 to
 kind
 of


help
 people
 on
 their
 journey.
 And
 if
 I


could
 have,
 if
 we
 could
 go
 back,
 we


would
 maybe
 even
 started
 that
 even


sooner.
 So,


>> thank
 you,
 Don.
 How
 about
 you,
 Lloyd?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 I'd
 echo
 Frodo.
 We


are
 running
 at
 this
 very
 fast
 at
 HD,
 and


I'd
 like
 to
 think
 we're
 we're
 sort
 of


ahead
 of
 the
 curve.
 We
 were
 building
 our


first
 AI
 products
 back
 in
 2023,
 but
 if
 I


could
 say
 one
 thing,
 it
 would
 be
 run


even
 faster
 towards
 this.
 um
 just
 the


you
 know
 the
 exponential
 rate
 of


improvement
 of
 models
 and
 the
 ecosystem


that's
 developing
 around
 that
 is
 uh


frankly
 unprecedented
 so
 yeah
 I
 would


have
 said
 um
 you
 know
 run
 even
 harder


even
 faster
 Michael


>> so
 we're
 pretty
 relentlessly
 datadriven


and
 one
 thing
 we
 do
 is
 we
 look
 at
 the
 uh


usage
 intensity
 across
 the
 firm
 and
 what


you
 see
 is
 a
 lognormal
 curve
 something


like
 this
 and
 the
 theoretical


underpinning
 of
 that
 is
 it
 it
 describes


processes
 that
 are
 roughly
 the
 more
 you


use
 it,
 the
 more
 you
 use
 it.
 So
 they're


multiplicative.


And
 if
 you
 combine
 that
 with
 this


bottomup
 view,
 what
 you
 want
 to
 do
 is


just
 encourage
 people
 to
 take
 more
 bites


of
 the
 apple.
 So
 here
 are
 two
 things


that
 I
 do
 to
 to
 help
 make
 that
 happen.


Uh,
 one,
 uh,
 at
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 team


meetings,
 I
 just
 make
 people
 do
 a


lightning
 round
 of
 some
 strange
 AI
 thing


you
 tried
 in
 the
 last
 week.
 It
 worked,


it
 didn't
 work,
 but
 you
 know,
 30
 seconds


each
 share
 with
 the
 team.
 Um,
 and
 two,


and
 this
 plays
 off
 something
 you
 said,


the
 route
 to
 comfort
 and
 learning
 about


how
 to
 use
 these
 at
 work
 doesn't
 have
 to


only
 run
 through
 work.
 And
 often
 people


are
 more
 comfortable
 taking
 risk
 in


their
 personal
 life.
 Uh
 it's
 not
 as


potentially
 embarrassing
 at
 least
 in


their
 minds.
 And
 so
 encouraging
 people


to
 experiment
 there
 I
 think
 can
 pay
 off


uh
 as
 much
 or
 more
 than
 encouraging
 them


to
 take
 those
 first
 jumps
 in
 the


workplace.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 I
 could
 not
 agree
 more
 and


that's
 a
 huge
 huge


I
 think
 benefit
 to


driving
 adoption
 for
 everyone
 here
 today


and
 dialed
 in.


If
 I
 had
 to
 recap
 what
 we've
 talked


about
 today
 is
 enable.
 So
 give
 your


employees
 access
 to
 one
 of
 these
 tools.


Train.
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 a
 master


trainer
 or
 you
 know
 a
 buy
 a


million-dollar
 training
 program.
 You
 can


work
 with
 some
 great
 partners
 of
 which


we've
 t
 touched
 on
 a
 few
 of
 them
 today


and
 you
 can
 use
 a
 claude
 to
 help
 you


build
 a
 training
 program
 to
 give
 them


baseline
 training.
 I'm
 not
 talking
 about


100
 hours
 here.
 Baseline
 how
 to
 prompt


how
 to
 interact
 with
 these
 tools


measure.
 There's
 to
 Michael's
 point
 now.


I
 think
 he's
 doing
 it
 in
 a
 really
 great


natural
 way.
 Let's
 do
 a
 speed
 round
 at


Enthropic.
 You
 can
 imagine
 it's
 like
 we


are
 monitoring
 in
 a
 way
 are
 you
 using


these
 tools
 to
 do
 a
 better
 job
 and
 like


you're
 actually
 tracking
 that
 because


whether
 or
 not
 you
 use
 them
 it's
 making


sure
 you
 hold
 your
 employees
 accountable


for
 building
 that
 muscle


and
 getting
 used
 to
 using
 it.
 I'll
 share


a
 p
 personal
 anecdote
 in
 closing
 and


Michael
 touched
 on
 this.
 Sometimes
 folks


are
 more
 comfortable


using
 this
 technology
 in
 their
 personal


lives
 to
 see
 what's
 capable
 of
 them


work.
 I
 have
 a
 2-year-old
 son
 who
 has
 a


lot
 of
 medical


concerns


and
 the
 in
 learning
 to
 navigate
 what
 his


challenges
 were
 and
 what
 we
 could
 do
 for


him.
 The
 hospital
 sent
 over,00
 pages
 of


notes
 from
 the
 NICU


from
 our
 neurologists


and
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 make
 sense
 of
 all


of
 it.
 So
 even
 when
 you
 talk
 to


different
 doctors,
 it's
 they
 all
 give


you
 different
 answers.
 And


I
 took
 all
 of
 this
 and
 I
 uploaded
 to


Claude.
 I
 go,
 "Help
 me
 understand
 what's


happening
 here."
 And
 I
 took
 that


timeline
 and
 I'm
 not
 suggesting
 Claude's


a
 doctor
 by
 any
 means.
 Um,
 I
 just
 took


that
 timeline,
 1100
 pages
 by
 the
 way,


PDFs,
 and
 I
 took
 it
 back
 to
 our
 doctor.


I'm
 like,
 "Does
 this
 seem
 right?
 Help
 me


understand
 what
 happened
 here
 and
 what
 I


can
 do
 about
 it."
 And
 literally
 the


doctor's
 jaw
 dropped.
 He's
 like, "How


did
 you
 come
 up
 with
 this?"
 And
 I'm
 not


sharing
 that
 story
 because
 look
 how


great
 Claude
 is.
 I'm
 sharing
 that
 story


because
 in
 moments
 like
 that
 when
 it
 has


such
 a
 meaningful
 impact
 on
 your
 life


personally,
 you
 can
 see
 my
 inclination


irrespective
 of
 working
 in
 a
 company


like
 Anthropic
 to
 try
 using
 this


technology
 in
 work
 goes
 up
 dramatically.


So
 as
 a
 takeaway,


if
 you
 don't
 have
 one
 of
 these
 apps,


these
 AI
 apps
 in
 your
 phone
 today,
 I'm


going
 to
 say
 step
 one,
 use
 it.
 Set
 a


goal
 for
 yourself.
 Use
 it.
 I
 don't
 care


if
 you're
 taking
 a
 photo
 of
 a
 tree
 or


you're
 analyzing
 life
 insurance


statements
 or
 policies.
 Use
 it
 a
 couple


times
 a
 day.
 Build
 the
 muscle
 and
 in


turn
 you'll
 be
 better
 equipped


to
 do
 that
 with
 your
 own
 employees.
 So,


I
 want
 to
 say
 a
 big
 thank
 you
 to
 our


panel.
 I
 really,
 really
 appreciate
 it.


Thank
 you
 for
 everyone
 who
 dialed
 in
 and


joining
 us
 today.
 And
 for
 those
 seated,


stay
 put
 because
 we'll
 have
 a
 chance
 for


questions.
 But
 a
 big


[Applause]
