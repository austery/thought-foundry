[Music]


hi
 everyone
 today
 we
 have
 the
 great


pleasure
 of
 having
 Peter
 Harrison
 on
 the


show
 Peter
 is
 the
 CEO
 of
 schroers
 one
 of


the
 biggest
 asset
 managers
 in
 Europe
 and


amazingly
 shos
 has
 been
 in
 business
 for


nearly
 or
 for
 roughly
 200
 years
 Peter


great
 to
 have
 you
 here
 thank
 you
 great


question
 it's
 also
 quite
 fun
 because


schroers
 is
 one
 of
 the
 longest
 standing


Partners
 we
 have
 in
 the
 fund
 in
 the


Norwegian
 someone
 wealth
 fund
 um
 we
 have


relationships
 going
 back
 to
 you
 know


roughly
 25
 years
 yeah
 yeah
 nice
 is
 a


great
 privilege
 to
 run
 money
 for
 you


only
 45
 out
 of
 1
 million


companies
 exist
 for
 100
 years
 and
 you've


been
 doing
 it
 for
 200
 years
 what's
 the


what's
 the
 trick
 so
 I
 think
 the
 the
 key


is
 committed
 ownership
 we've
 got
 a


family
 backing
 who
 takes
 a
 20year
 view


of
 where
 we
 need
 to
 go
 and
 and
 because


of
 that
 the
 business
 has
 changed
 and


evolved
 and
 the
 we've
 been
 in
 lots
 of


different
 businesses
 in
 the
 finance


sector
 throughout
 that
 time
 but
 we've


continued
 to
 change
 and
 I
 think
 that's


only
 possible
 if
 you've
 got
 a
 commit


long-term
 ownership
 structure
 which


allows
 that
 change
 if
 we
 do
 the
 last
 10


years
 what
 are
 the
 biggest
 changes


you've
 seen
 in
 Investment
 Management


huge
 yeah
 so
 massive
 growth
 of
 passive


management
 huge
 growth
 towards
 privates


um
 a
 collapse
 in
 fees
 so
 just
 to
 for
 the


for
 the
 listeners
 uh
 private
 is
 like


private
 Equity
 passive
 is
 index
 funds


absolutely
 and
 and
 and
 private
 debt
 the


world
 the
 world
 is
 moving
 away
 from


public
 companies
 towards
 private


companies
 um
 a
 a
 revolution
 in


governance
 huge
 agenda
 on
 climate
 um


collapse
 in
 fees
 so
 wholesale
 change
 the


industry
 is
 going
 through
 a
 major


disruption
 a
 while
 back
 there
 were
 lots


of
 English
 companies
 in
 this
 industry


you
 know
 really
 really
 Grand
 names
 doing


very
 well
 huge
 tradition
 and
 then
 the


Americans
 came
 and
 ate
 your
 lunch
 so


look
 I
 think
 the
 two
 things
 the
 capital


markets
 moved
 towards
 America
 that
 was


the
 first
 thing
 and
 they
 started
 with
 a


huge
 domestic
 bias
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 the


UK
 companies
 evolved
 and
 and
 part
 of


what
 we've
 been
 in
 the
 business
 of
 is


trying
 to
 change
 the
 business
 to
 where


the
 fast
 flowing
 water
 is
 today
 there's


very
 very
 different
 markets
 and
 and
 if


you
 don't
 change
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 be


in
 the
 fast
 flowing
 water
 why
 are
 the


Americans
 doing
 better
 well
 I
 think
 I


think
 the
 size
 of
 the
 domestic
 Market


makes
 it
 able
 to
 able
 to
 create
 scale


and
 this
 is
 a
 scale
 business
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 you
 you
 need
 to
 invest
 hugely


in
 Tech
 in
 data
 and
 and
 if
 you
 don't
 if


you
 if
 you
 you
 cannot
 shrink
 to
 grow
 and


I
 think
 too
 many
 companies
 s
 they
 saw


the
 disruption
 and
 they
 thought
 actually


we're
 going
 to
 shrink
 we're
 going
 to
 try


and
 cut
 costs
 we
 took
 the
 view
 we
 need


to
 invest
 to
 grow
 and
 it's
 it
 was
 a


different
 strategy
 but
 it's
 I
 think
 the


only
 way
 through
 it
 and
 the
 Americans


being
 American
 they
 tend
 to
 want
 to


invest
 to
 grow
 but
 it's
 not
 only
 the


asset
 management
 it's
 also
 the
 banks


like
 the
 merging
 Banks
 absolutely
 right


absolutely
 right
 but
 are
 the
 Americans


working
 harder
 are
 they
 clever
 what
 is


it
 no
 no
 they're
 not
 they're
 not
 working


hard
 and
 they're
 not
 clever
 but
 they
 do


have
 some
 innate
 advantages
 of
 of
 scale


to
 start
 with
 they
 had
 more
 partnership


type
 structures
 which
 I
 think
 is
 is
 is
 a


very
 good
 structure
 in
 an
 asset


management
 business
 um
 because
 you're


sharing
 100%
 %
 of
 the
 pie
 with
 with


people
 in
 the
 business
 rather
 than
 a


portion
 of
 the
 pie
 and
 I
 think
 we've


also
 seen
 this
 very
 big
 change
 of
 the


growth
 of
 privates
 and
 and
 in
 private


markets
 the
 bigger
 you
 are
 the
 bigger


the
 mode
 are
 you
 sure
 they're
 not


working
 harder
 so
 I
 heard
 a
 story
 which


I
 actually
 think
 may
 be
 true
 uh
 when
 the


Americans
 came
 to
 to
 London
 they
 had
 the


widest
 margin
 and
 the
 most
 profitable


day
 on
 part
 of
 the
 week
 on
 Friday


morning
 because
 the
 English
 guys
 had


been
 out
 drinking
 on
 Thursday
 night
 and


so
 they
 were
 just
 wider
 spreads
 less


Keen
 competition
 and
 the
 American
 guys


were
 just
 like
 in
 there
 Friday
 morning


bang
 hitting
 it
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 walk


around
 this
 building
 this
 is
 this
 this


place
 is
 full
 so
 I
 can
 only
 speak
 for


here
 but
 but
 then
 we've
 been
 successful


during
 that
 period
 yeah
 what's
 been
 the


most
 important
 things
 that
 schroers
 have


done
 lately
 we've
 pivoted
 towards


privates
 we've
 pivoted
 towards
 wealth


we've
 spent
 a
 lot
 on
 technology
 we've


spent
 a
 lot
 on
 uh
 sustainability
 and


what
 that
 means
 um
 and
 I'm
 sure
 we


should
 talk
 more
 about
 that
 but
 I
 for
 me


the
 ability
 to
 move
 and
 innov


and
 being
 being
 really
 tough
 on


ourselves
 to
 change
 and
 I
 think
 that


that
 requires
 cultural
 change
 and
 it


requires
 new
 capabilities
 so
 so
 it's


required
 a
 lot
 of
 change
 during
 the
 last


10
 years
 how
 does
 the
 kind
 of
 the


decline
 of
 the
 UK
 Capital
 Market
 play
 in


here
 so
 if
 you
 go
 back
 go
 back
 15
 years


the
 UK
 has
 one
 of
 the
 largest
 pools
 of


domestic
 Savings
 in
 the
 world
 yeah
 and


we
 regulated
 that
 out
 of
 existence
 so
 it


basically
 bought
 government
 bonds
 and


and
 stop
 taking
 risk
 and
 we
 put
 consumer


protection
 at
 the
 center
 and
 that
 Shrunk


the
 UK
 as
 as
 an
 equity
 Market


considerably
 saw
 huge
 outflows
 over
 the


last
 15
 years
 and
 then
 we
 put
 in
 a


corporate
 governance
 code
 which
 said


conflict
 between
 shareholders
 and


companies
 is
 a
 good
 thing
 and
 everything


every
 League
 table
 was
 the
 more
 times


you
 vote
 against
 management
 the
 better


and
 those
 two
 things
 were
 were
 unhelpful


for
 listings
 they
 were
 unhelpful
 for


thriving
 domestic
 Capital
 those
 are
 now


changing
 and
 people
 are
 are
 going
 back


towards
 more
 risk-
 taking
 they're
 going


back
 to
 a
 more
 constructive
 environment


so
 the
 the
 listed
 Market
 has
 has


struggled
 I
 think
 what's
 happened
 at
 the


same
 time
 is
 London
 has
 boomed
 with


private
 markets
 with
 hedge
 funds
 um
 as
 a


center
 for
 you
 know
 people
 coming


together
 we've
 got
 some
 fantastic
 Life


Sciences
 the
 problem
 is
 it's
 being
 it's


foreign
 Capital
 which
 is
 driving
 those


businesses
 not
 domestic
 Capital
 so
 the


returns
 are
 not
 going
 to
 UK
 Savers
 and
 I


think
 as
 a
 country
 that's
 a
 big
 problem


but
 it's
 also
 probably
 the
 constituent


is
 of
 of
 the
 stock
 markets
 right
 so
 um


uh
 the
 US
 market
 has
 compounded
 at


roughly
 twice
 the
 rate
 of
 Europe
 over


the
 last
 10
 years
 of
 course
 due
 to
 a
 lot


of
 you
 know
 much
 more
 TCH
 companies
 in


in
 the
 UK
 more
 mining
 oil
 yeah
 we've
 got


the
 companies
 of
 100
 years
 ago
 and
 and


they're
 not
 the
 companies
 that
 that
 are


driving
 the
 growth
 of
 the
 future
 and
 I


think
 creating
 a
 listings
 environment


where
 people
 want
 to
 and
 creating
 an


environment
 where
 where
 management
 want


to
 be
 listed
 in
 London
 has
 been
 a
 big


part
 of
 the
 change
 which
 has
 been
 going


on
 over
 the
 last
 few
 years
 to
 say
 say


this
 this
 is
 unacceptable
 you
 cannot


have
 your
 best
 companies
 going
 and


listing
 overseas
 how
 important
 is
 the


salaries
 and
 board
 salar
 salaries
 a
 lot


more
 scrutiny
 in
 the
 UK
 a
 huge
 amount
 of


scrutiny
 I
 think
 it's
 this
 notion
 that


there's
 a
 conflict
 between
 shareholders


and
 management
 and
 for
 me
 the
 best


businesses
 are
 grown
 by
 by
 great


management
 but
 good
 alignment
 with


shareholders
 and
 the
 more
 Agency


problems
 you
 get
 the
 the
 more
 people


don't
 aim
 at
 creating
 great
 businesses


and
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 been
 part
 of


the
 UK
 problem
 what
 does
 brexit
 do
 to


this
 well
 breakfast
 was
 just
 it


undermined
 two
 things
 it
 undermined


confidence
 in
 the
 UK
 as
 a
 place
 to
 make


long-term
 decisions
 and
 it
 created
 two


or
 three
 years
 of
 complete
 Hiatus
 and


then
 you
 after
 brexit
 you
 had
 Boris


government
 Boris
 Johnson's
 government


you
 had
 a
 whole
 set
 of
 challenges
 around


LZ
 trust's
 budget
 and
 the
 guilts
 crisis


all
 of
 a
 sudden
 the
 UK
 as
 a
 serious


counterpart
 and
 a
 place
 to
 invest


started
 to
 decline
 we've
 started
 to
 see


that
 correct
 but
 but
 say
 scars
 take
 a


while
 to
 heal
 now
 um
 the
 effort
 to


reboot
 the
 pensions
 industry
 to
 get


better
 outcome
 for
 pensioners
 how
 is


that
 going
 so
 because
 you've
 been
 part


of
 some
 of
 these
 commit
 it's
 been
 it's
 a


big
 big
 effort
 to
 change
 I
 think
 we've


we've
 we've
 done
 a
 couple
 of
 things


we've
 changed
 all
 the
 listing
 rules
 and


changed
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 the
 structural


stuff
 you're
 about
 to
 see
 a
 big
 set
 of


changes
 come
 through
 in
 the
 corporate


governance
 environment
 and
 a
 return
 to


complier
 explain
 as
 a
 as
 a
 way
 of
 how
 do


you
 you
 know
 if
 a
 company
 doesn't
 follow


the
 rules
 can
 do
 they
 get
 the


opportunity
 to
 explain
 why
 they're
 doing


it
 differently
 and
 I
 think
 that
 that's


going
 to
 come
 through
 helpfully
 um
 and


you're
 getting
 a
 freeing
 up
 of
 a
 lot
 of


the
 capital
 which
 is
 previously
 just
 put


into
 you
 know
 risk
 minimization
 we
 have


in
 the
 UK
 300
 billion
 in
 tax
 advantage


cash
 savings
 and
 virtually
 no
 Financial


advice
 everybody
 sits
 in
 cash
 rather


than
 taking
 risk
 well
 if
 you
 don't
 take


risk
 you
 don't
 earn
 return
 and
 that's


the
 UK's
 problem
 we
 put
 consumer


protection
 right
 at
 the
 center
 and


killed
 risk
 taking
 is
 there
 um
 a
 danger


that
 in
 order
 to
 attract
 companies
 you


loosen
 up
 on
 the
 rules
 and
 regulations


to
 the
 extent
 that
 it
 becomes
 you
 know


uh
 Wild
 West
 well
 that's
 that's
 the


argument
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 will
 make


the
 the
 other
 question
 is
 if
 you
 take
 no


risk
 you
 don't
 get
 a
 return
 and
 so
 I
 I


think
 the
 the
 answer
 is
 you
 you
 have
 a


set
 of
 rules
 and
 if
 companies
 abide
 by


those
 rules
 they
 can
 list
 in
 the
 UK
 and


then
 it's
 for
 active
 managers
 to
 choose


which
 they
 want
 to
 own
 and
 which
 they


don't
 want
 to
 own
 and
 and
 I
 think
 the
 UK


has
 always
 been
 good
 at
 active
 risk-


taking
 and
 I
 think
 you
 slightly
 careful


that
 you
 don't
 set
 a
 set
 of
 rules
 which


is
 so
 prohibitive
 that
 no
 one
 wants
 to


be
 here
 and
 that's
 where
 we
 were
 5
 years


ago
 that
 that's
 changed
 do
 we
 need
 a


unified


European
 Equity
 Capital
 Market
 yeah
 and


will
 will
 we
 get
 it
 no
 why
 not
 too


politically
 difficult
 there's
 two


there's
 too
 much
 stress
 within
 the


European
 experiment
 to
 see
 that
 that


convergence
 come
 together
 I
 mean
 if
 if


we
 had
 it
 what
 would
 you
 do
 well
 I
 think


I
 think
 you
 create
 a
 a
 big
 enough
 single


Capital
 Market
 that
 it
 starts
 to
 be


competitive
 against
 the
 US
 the
 great
 the


the
 the
 challenge
 of
 the
 last
 few
 years


has
 been
 that
 we
 used
 to
 have
 London
 New


York
 and
 one
 or
 two
 other
 markets
 now


there
 are
 probably
 15
 challenges
 to
 be
 a


Global
 Financial
 market
 and
 Europe
 needs


to
 act
 get
 it
 act
 together
 and
 and
 act


its
 size
 but
 it's
 so
 fragmented
 and


there's
 so
 many
 so
 many
 bits
 of


Arbitrage
 I
 mean
 if
 we
 just
 take
 we
 had


a
 set
 of
 rules
 that
 came
 out
 called
 mhid


which
 was
 a
 um
 sounds
 really
 geeky
 but


actually
 there
 was
 a
 really
 really


pernicious
 changes
 that
 took
 place
 in


the
 way
 a
 lot
 of
 research
 was
 done
 and


but
 every
 country
 interpreted
 them


differently
 and
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that
 you


got
 more


fragmentation
 and
 you
 get
 ultimately


atomization
 and
 the
 US
 will
 carry
 on


growing
 and
 so
 me
 it
 was
 an
 effort
 to


get
 uh
 the
 clients
 to
 pay
 separately
 for


research
 but
 that
 was
 one
 part
 of
 it


yeah
 it
 also
 was
 hundreds
 of
 thousands


of
 pages
 of
 reporting
 Etc
 which
 was
 you


know
 sits
 in
 a
 vault
 somewhere
 no
 idea


whatever
 happens
 to
 it
 from
 an
 asset
 uh


management
 point
 of
 view
 are
 you
 happy


with
 the
 government
 so
 far
 I
 think


they've
 picked
 up
 the
 battern
 of
 needing


to
 change
 and
 understanding
 that
 growth


is
 important
 and
 understanding
 the


environment
 for
 growth
 and
 an
 industrial


strategy
 is
 important
 so
 that
 bit
 that


bit
 seems
 to
 be
 coming
 through
 but
 it's


very
 early
 days
 the
 government
 is
 tough


and
 it's
 really
 tough
 when
 there's
 no


money
 and
 in
 the
 UK
 there
 is
 no
 money


and
 and
 that's
 going
 to
 you
 know
 how
 do


you
 balance
 growth
 and
 higher
 taxes
 you


mentioned
 the
 private
 Market
 or
 you
 know


private
 equity
 and
 so
 on
 how
 uh
 what


kind
 of
 role
 is
 that
 going
 to
 play
 for


individuals
 who
 save
 for
 retirement
 I


think
 it
 needs
 to
 play
 a
 much
 bigger


role
 so
 if
 why
 well
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 the


a
 lot
 of
 the
 future
 is
 around
 how
 we


fund
 climate
 transition
 how
 we
 fund


synthetic
 biology
 how
 we
 fund
 AI
 public


markets
 are
 not
 naturally
 good
 at
 A


disruption
 and
 B
 funding
 change
 so


you're
 going
 to
 see
 that
 Innovation
 come


from
 private
 markets
 and
 if
 we
 don't
 if


we
 don't
 Embrace
 that
 and
 we
 and
 we
 and


we
 hide
 in
 those
 companies
 of
 100
 years


ago
 those
 new
 returns
 and
 that


disruption
 will
 only
 be
 a
 cost
 to
 end


Savers
 rather
 than
 a
 benefit
 to
 them
 so


I
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 there
 is
 a
 big


change
 required
 I
 mean
 public
 markets


are
 shrinking
 really
 quickly
 the
 number


of
 companies
 that
 are
 D
 listing
 is
 down


what
 40%
 over
 20
 years
 the
 stock
 in


trade
 of
 a
 traditional
 public
 markets


investor
 you
 know
 your
 clients
 our


clients
 is
 shrinking
 the
 availability
 of


alpha
 is
 shrinking
 the
 ability
 to


outperform
 markets
 so
 for
 me
 those
 are


those
 are
 those
 are
 really
 big
 issues


that
 as
 the
 Frog
 quietly
 boils
 in
 the


pan
 they
 don't
 get
 talked
 about
 enough


and
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 big
 changes
 we're


going
 to
 see
 is
 Is
 wealth
 markets
 which


don't
 traditionally
 have
 big
 exposure
 to


private
 markets
 are
 going
 to
 move
 much


more
 into
 priv
 and
 you're
 seeing
 it
 in


the
 states
 you're
 seeing
 it
 biggest


families
 I
 mean
 you
 cater
 for
 private


Equity
 you
 also
 cater
 for
 wealth


management
 right
 yeah
 so
 this
 is
 a


relatively
 new
 thing
 for
 you
 yeah
 in
 the


last
 we've
 we've
 done
 wealth
 management


for
 many
 years
 we've
 we've
 made
 it
 a
 lot


bigger
 over
 the
 last
 10
 years
 and
 we've


doubled
 the
 size
 of
 the
 company
 and
 and


that's
 mainly
 been
 through
 growing
 our


privates
 business
 and
 growing
 our
 wealth


business
 AI
 how
 is
 that
 going
 to
 change


the
 way
 you
 do
 things
 everything
 in
 what


ways
 everything
 well
 I
 think
 it


fundamentally
 changes
 the
 landscape
 of


the
 companies
 we
 invest
 in
 in
 the
 very


short
 term
 we
 will
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time


trying
 to
 do
 things


better
 in
 the
 probably
 far
 more
 quickly


than
 we
 realize
 we
 will


find
 we
 do
 things
 very
 very
 very


differently
 and
 the
 moment
 we're
 all


thinking
 about
 the
 better
 bit
 but


actually
 the
 real
 change
 will
 come
 from


when
 we
 do
 it
 differently
 so
 I
 think
 in


the
 first
 place
 we'll
 see
 a
 major


changes
 in
 wealth
 because
 my
 sense
 is


that
 people
 will
 turn
 to
 their
 beautiful


AI
 assistant
 who
 will
 become
 who
 will


know
 them
 better
 than
 anybody
 and
 ask


them
 for
 wealth
 advice
 in
 way
 that
 they


currently
 ask
 people
 and
 I
 I
 don't


believe
 our
 portfolio
 managers
 are
 in


different
 from
 any
 other
 industry
 if
 we


can
 if
 if
 AI
 is
 helping
 understand
 the


human
 genome
 back
 backwards
 the


microbiome
 backwards
 it
 can
 certainly


help
 you
 make
 become
 a
 better
 investor


and
 I
 think
 it's
 beholden
 on
 us
 to
 make


sure
 those
 tools
 and
 that
 data
 is
 in


front
 of
 our
 portfolio
 managers
 when


they
 make
 decisions
 moving
 on
 to


investment
 philosophy
 is
 there
 a


Schroeder
 way
 of
 running
 money
 no
 there


is
 a
 schroer
 set
 of
 philosophy
 about
 how


you
 create
 great
 teams
 and
 how
 you
 take


risk
 um
 but
 our
 philosophy
 is
 you
 create


individual
 markets
 require
 different


different
 treatment
 so
 if
 you're


investing
 in
 China
 you
 need
 a
 different


approach
 but
 you
 almost
 certainly
 will


have
 a
 relatively
 small
 team
 with
 great


tools
 you'll
 be
 led
 by
 by
 brilliant


people
 you'll
 grow
 people
 internally


rather
 than
 try
 and
 hire
 them
 in
 because


it's
 so
 now
 now
 you
 are
 on
 how
 to
 build


good
 teams
 how
 to
 build
 good
 teams
 okay


let's
 do
 that
 so
 how
 do
 you
 build
 good


teams
 first
 thing
 you
 you
 need
 brilliant


leaders
 of
 those
 teams
 you
 need
 to
 give


them
 great
 tools
 they
 need
 to
 be
 the


right
 size
 they
 need
 to
 be
 near
 their


local
 markets
 um
 and
 you
 need
 to
 give


them
 space
 to
 get
 things
 wrong
 because


great
 investors
 don't
 get
 it
 right
 every


single
 day
 then
 they
 might
 be
 wrong
 for


three
 or
 four
 years
 at
 a
 time
 time
 and


you've
 got
 to
 be
 willing
 to
 put
 your


arms
 around
 them
 and
 support
 them
 but


the
 critical
 thing
 is
 you
 understand
 the


risk
 they
 take
 and
 they're
 good
 Risk


Takers
 and
 you
 and
 you
 got
 your
 head


around
 who
 is
 managing
 their
 way
 through


that
 and
 the
 path
 dependency
 of
 returns


so
 we
 are
 invested
 with
 some
 some
 of


your
 best
 teams
 right
 what
 would
 you
 say


they
 have
 in
 common
 what
 do
 great
 teams


have
 in
 common
 huge
 consistency
 of


people
 MH
 openness
 to
 external
 thinking


they
 they
 look
 out
 they
 don't
 look
 in


and
 they're
 great
 Risk
 Takers
 what
 is
 a


great
 risk
 taker
 they
 understand
 they


understand
 the
 risk
 reward
 equations
 and


they
 understand
 when
 they
 change
 and


they
 understand
 why
 they've
 been
 wrong


in
 a
 way
 that
 is
 you
 you
 can
 be
 wrong
 in


China
 because
 state
 owned
 Enterprises


are
 doing
 something
 because
 some


government
 stimulus
 or
 you
 can
 be
 wrong


because
 you've
 just
 picked
 the
 wrong


company
 or
 or
 you've
 or
 you've
 got
 a
 the


company
 you
 have
 the
 motors
 disappeared


and
 you
 end
 up
 clinging
 on
 to
 it
 for
 too


long
 if
 you
 you
 need
 to
 understand
 the


price
 action
 and
 how
 the
 business
 is


changing
 and
 be
 willing
 to
 change
 and


some
 people
 get
 stuck
 others
 move
 and


it's
 the
 ones
 that
 move
 and
 are
 able
 to


adapt
 and
 and
 hold
 on
 to
 a
 consistent


philosophy
 and
 and
 so
 so
 often
 you
 see


people
 wavering
 and
 if
 you
 see
 people


wavering
 the
 chances
 are
 they
 won't
 be


able
 to
 navigate
 through
 long-term


change
 one
 of
 the
 pros
 and
 cons
 of
 not


having
 one
 way
 of
 running
 Capital


because
 um
 Fidelity
 I
 guess
 got
 you
 know


one
 way
 of
 running
 you
 know
 Capital
 uh


cap
 the
 capital
 has
 got
 one
 way
 running


Capital
 well
 capital's
 got
 it's
 got


several
 ways
 of
 running
 Capital
 because


they
 give
 it
 to
 lots
 of
 individual
 teams


and
 then
 they're
 very
 clever
 of
 the
 way


they
 aggregate
 it
 up
 but
 I
 think
 the
 for


me
 it's
 the
 accountability
 so
 you
 you've


got
 that
 ability
 to
 look
 at
 a
 team
 and


say
 our
 oil
 price
 forecast
 doesn't
 come


from
 one
 Central
 person
 who
 and
 then
 put


it
 into
 the
 whole
 system
 and
 when
 it


goes
 wrong
 blows
 up
 the
 whole
 system
 so


it
 creates
 a
 business
 resilience
 that
 is


stronger
 but
 I
 think
 that
 accountability


of
 a
 team
 who
 is
 job
 it
 is
 and
 they
 can


see
 everyone
 in
 the
 team
 they
 all
 know


know
 who's
 accountable
 for
 what
 when


you're
 trying
 to
 do
 that
 at
 an


organizational
 scale
 it's
 really
 hard
 to


hold
 that
 accountability
 in
 alignment


for
 long
 periods
 of
 time
 particularly


through
 change
 and
 what
 you
 tend
 to
 see


is
 those
 companies
 that
 have
 a
 whole


organization
 investment
 process
 can
 go


through
 long
 downward
 spirals
 because


the
 organization
 starts
 to
 question
 its


own
 raise
 on
 debt
 and
 I
 I
 think
 in
 a


world
 where
 we
 need
 to
 be
 very
 adaptive


the
 ability
 to
 have
 small
 teams
 adapting


is
 a
 lot
 stronger
 now
 you've
 got
 You'


got
 to
 give
 them
 great
 tools
 you've
 got


to
 give
 them
 great
 data
 what
 are
 great


tools
 well
 I
 so
 for
 me
 look
 when
 I
 when


I
 first
 joined
 this
 industry
 35
 years


ago
 our
 competitive
 Advantage
 was
 being


able
 to
 key
 in
 10
 years
 of
 reporting


accounts
 into
 um
 a
 spreadsheet
 to
 build


a
 two-year
 earnings
 model
 right
 yeah


that
 does
 that
 doesn't
 win
 anymore
 does


today
 that
 takes
 about
 two
 seconds
 to
 do


that
 but
 there
 is
 a
 huge
 amount
 of


unstructured
 data
 out
 there
 telling
 us


what's
 going
 on
 in
 businesses
 what


companies
 are
 really
 doing
 what
 the


supply
 chains
 look
 like
 that
 that


unstructured
 data
 takes
 a
 lot
 of
 getting


and
 processing
 and
 and
 bringing
 out


those
 those
 are
 the
 sorts
 of
 things
 I


mean
 by
 great
 tools
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the


joke
 I
 always
 have
 is
 that
 Bloomberg
 has


um
 something
 like
 a
 100,000
 functions


and
 a
 great
 portfolio
 manager
 might
 use


30
 of
 them
 and
 that's
 not
 that's
 not
 the


right
 answer
 how
 do
 you
 get
 the
 right


information
 in
 front
 of
 your
 investors


so
 they
 make
 great
 decisions
 how
 do
 you


train
 people
 you
 grow
 them
 I
 think
 we're


in
 apprenticeship
 business
 and
 and
 that


requires
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 mentorship
 it


requires
 a
 a
 great
 recruitment
 process


at
 the
 beginning
 and
 it
 requires
 the


ability
 to
 move
 people
 through
 a
 system


and
 gradually
 give
 them
 um


accountability
 so
 when
 I
 joined
 as
 a


graduate
 trainee
 you
 spent
 time
 you
 know


I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 as
 an
 engineering


analyst
 then
 I
 could
 go
 on
 and
 do


another
 industry
 and
 bit
 by
 bit
 you


learn
 your
 craft
 I
 I'm
 not
 a
 great


believer
 that
 we
 are
 good
 at
 bringing
 in


rock
 stars
 from
 the
 outside
 there
 are


businesses
 that
 do
 that
 incredibly
 well


you
 know
 the
 citadels
 and
 millenniums
 do


that
 that's
 not
 us
 let's
 move
 on
 to
 your


leadership
 what's
 been
 the
 main


management
 lessons
 for
 you
 as
 you
 have


moved
 from
 being
 an
 investor
 to
 becoming


the
 CEO
 it's
 tough
 the
 best
 job
 in
 our


industry
 is
 being
 an
 investor
 right
 so


so
 you
 know
 that's
 that's
 that's
 the


first
 hard
 bit
 and
 you
 have
 this
 this


crisis
 moment
 where
 you
 don't
 turn
 on


your
 Bloomberg
 in
 the
 morning
 you
 turn


on
 your
 you
 turn
 on
 your
 emails
 were
 you


a
 good
 investor
 no
 not
 not
 good
 enough


and
 it
 was
 realization
 I
 wasn't
 a
 good


enough


investor
 is
 it
 the
 pie
 of
 principal
 you


rise
 to
 your
 own
 level
 of
 incompetence


in
 a
 hierarchy
 or
 something
 like
 that
 um


so
 that
 so
 the
 the
 first
 the
 first
 thing


was
 was
 get
 getting
 over
 being
 an


investor
 and
 not
 trying
 to
 drive
 from


the
 back
 seat
 um
 the
 second
 was


understanding
 what
 sort
 of
 leader
 I
 was


because
 you
 don't
 really
 know
 that
 when


you
 start
 on
 the
 management
 journey
 and


what
 kind
 of
 leader
 are
 you
 well
 I
 I've


discovered
 that
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 connecting


with
 the
 organization
 and
 trying
 to


drive
 the
 heart
 of
 the
 organization
 as


much
 as
 the
 minds
 of
 the
 organization


has
 been
 ended
 up
 being
 being
 the
 style


that
 that
 I've
 done
 I'm
 passionate
 about


Innovation
 I'm
 I
 spent
 my
 time
 paid
 my


way
 through
 University
 Writing
 code
 so


I'm
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 geek
 so
 for
 me
 the
 the


getting
 the
 Innovation
 being
 really


consistent
 about
 your
 strategic
 Vision


just
 being
 resilient
 and
 not
 be
 banged


off
 course
 um
 but
 making
 sure
 you
 take


the
 organization
 with
 you
 because
 the


problem
 in
 most
 businesses
 is
 the
 huge


layers
 of
 permafrost
 that
 don't
 think


change
 has
 got
 anything
 to
 do
 with
 them


and
 how
 do
 you
 bring
 those
 people


through
 and
 and
 create
 those
 new


capabilities
 how
 do
 you
 melt
 permafrost


I
 think
 culture
 change
 the
 so
 so
 great


great
 teams
 right
 is
 a
 difference


between
 a
 between
 a
 good
 company
 and
 a


great
 company
 and
 and
 and
 great
 leaders


within
 those
 teams
 will
 will
 drive
 that


change
 but
 you
 need
 to
 shine
 daylight


into
 dark
 Corners
 it's
 the
 best


disinfectant
 and
 how
 do
 you
 do
 that
 part


of
 it
 is
 creating
 an
 open
 an
 honest


environment
 but
 so
 you
 know
 we
 there's


two
 let's
 say
 let's
 say
 we
 make
 an
 error


on
 a
 client
 account
 right
 there's
 two


ways
 of
 two
 ways
 of
 responding
 that


first
 is
 the
 obvious
 way
 which
 is
 had


you
 learn
 from
 it
 and
 the
 second
 way
 is


is
 finger
 pointing
 and
 all
 the
 rest
 of


it
 if
 you
 create
 the
 environment
 which


says
 we
 want
 to
 learn
 from
 this
 people


start
 most
 people
 want
 to
 come
 to
 work


to
 learn
 and
 I
 think
 you've
 got
 to


create
 that
 learning
 environment
 and


that
 trusting
 environment
 and
 once
 you


do
 that
 we're
 not
 a
 particularly
 big


company
 we're
 6,000
 people
 we
 we
 can
 be


trusted
 700
 so
 we
 we
 think
 you
 look
 you


look
 heck
 of
 a
 lot
 you
 know
 have
 you


been
 bold
 enough
 so
 I
 if
 I
 look
 back


what's
 the
 thing
 I
 wish
 I'd
 done
 more
 of


is
 be
 more
 bold
 and
 in
 what
 ways
 should


you
 have
 been
 more
 bold
 so
 we
 should


have
 done
 more
 private
 markets
 earlier


because
 compounding
 up
 we
 should
 have


probably
 been
 more
 willing
 to
 acquire


more
 teams
 and
 not
 do
 as
 much


organically
 um
 and
 I
 think
 I
 look
 back


the
 things
 but
 you
 have
 acquired
 quite
 a


lot
 we
 have
 acquired
 quite
 a
 lot
 but
 we


acquired
 small
 because
 I
 didn't
 want
 to


destroy
 the
 culture
 yeah
 and
 so
 for
 me


because
 the
 challenge
 I
 think
 is
 that


public
 market
 culture
 and
 private
 Market


culture
 are
 really
 different
 and
 can
 you


get
 them
 to
 coexist
 in
 the
 same


organization
 successfully
 is
 is
 hard
 and


that
 was
 the
 thing
 which
 you've
 seen


ruin
 many
 companies
 and
 I
 so
 I
 said


we're
 going
 to
 we're
 going
 to
 work


really
 hard
 at
 this
 but
 we're
 going
 to


go
 slowly
 with
 hindsight
 the
 disruption


in
 our
 industry
 has
 been
 way
 quicker


yeah
 than
 anyone
 thought
 yeah
 well
 uh


one
 of
 the
 things
 you
 bought
 was
 part
 of


Casino
 which
 is
 where
 I
 started


absolutely
 I
 started
 my
 my
 my
 career
 in


20
 well
 you
 bought
 it
 in
 2013
 part
 of
 it


uh
 and
 that's
 where
 I
 started
 straight


after
 school
 so
 um
 and
 that's
 doing


pretty
 well
 right
 it's
 it's
 it's
 on
 fire


it's
 growing
 it's
 probably
 the
 fastest


growing
 wealth
 business
 in
 the
 UK
 it's


it's
 got
 and
 it's
 got
 all
 the


characteristics
 it's
 got
 strong
 culture


it's
 got
 great
 investment
 performance


and
 it
 cares
 deeply
 about
 its
 clients


and
 if
 you
 if
 you
 have
 those
 three


things
 actually
 businesses
 will
 carry
 on


performing
 for
 very
 long
 periods
 of
 time


do
 you
 still
 have
 the
 queen
 as
 a
 client


I
 couldn't
 possibly
 comment
 uh
 in
 in
 a


short
 period
 of
 time
 you
 will
 uh
 pass
 uh


you
 know
 the
 bet
 on
 to
 Richard
 Oldfield


do
 you
 think
 that'd
 be
 difficult
 very


hard
 why
 I've
 been
 in
 this
 industry
 35


years
 I
 started
 here
 as
 a
 graduate


trainer
 I
 might
 have
 gone
 elsewhere
 but


I
 I
 will
 miss
 it's
 a
 very
 special


company
 and
 I
 will
 miss
 it
 massively
 and


you
 feel
 a
 great
 sense
 of
 indebtedness


to
 being
 it's
 a
 privilege
 to
 run
 a


company
 that
 you
 start
 start
 your
 career


in
 now
 if
 if
 I
 were
 to
 um
 play
 Devil's


Advocate
 a
 tiny
 bit
 here
 so
 um
 whilst


you
 being
 the
 CEO
 aset
 N
 Management
 have


grown
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 right
 more
 than


100%
 but
 uh
 fees
 generally
 come
 down


right
 uh
 because
 there's
 more
 well


there's
 generally
 pressure
 on
 fees
 costs


gone
 up
 profits
 down
 and
 the
 market


capitalization
 is
 is
 down
 compared
 to


when
 you
 started
 just
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do


you
 look
 at
 these
 various
 things
 so
 we


we're
 crossing
 so
 we
 started
 with
 a


traditional
 equities
 business
 which
 has


gone
 through
 huge
 disruption
 and
 and


everybody
 who
 had
 a
 traditional
 equities


business
 10
 years
 ago
 has
 seen
 a
 huge


change
 and
 many
 of
 those
 businesses
 are


down
 90%
 or
 actually
 don't
 exist
 anymore


so
 so
 what
 we've
 what
 we've
 done
 is


invested
 heavily
 in
 those
 new
 businesses


and
 we're
 crossing
 a
 valley
 so
 as
 a
 as
 a


traditional
 business
 has
 come
 under


pressure
 we've
 grown
 those
 new
 things


and
 as
 you
 see
 in
 our
 results
 the
 the


pace
 of
 growth
 of
 those
 new
 things
 now


outstrips
 the
 decline
 in
 the
 old


business
 so
 as
 we
 cross
 the
 valley
 that


the
 compound
 maths
 does
 your
 work
 for


you
 but
 it
 takes
 it
 takes
 a
 long
 time


and
 we
 were
 never
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


tear
 up
 the
 the
 really
 strong
 Foundation


that
 we
 had
 in
 that
 traditional
 business


it
 would
 been
 wrong
 to
 so
 we
 could
 for


me
 that
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 long


transition
 um
 we
 took
 the
 view
 that
 that


was
 the
 right
 way
 to
 make
 the
 transition


um
 but
 I
 if
 I
 look
 at
 us
 against
 our


peers
 I
 think
 we'
 we've
 done
 you
 know
 a


really
 strong
 job
 but
 I
 totally
 take
 the


point
 that
 you
 know
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 shareholders
 want
 alignment
 better


returns
 I
 just
 realized
 I
 asked
 a
 pretty


stupid
 question
 uh
 whether
 the
 queen
 was


still
 a
 client
 I
 suspect
 she
 isn't
 well


no
 I
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 put
 you
 right
 on


that
 but
 but
 I
 could
 change
 the
 royal


family
 but
 one
 of
 one
 of
 the
 one
 of
 the


highlights
 of
 of
 my
 uh
 of
 my
 time
 here


was
 was
 was
 coming
 to
 open
 our
 building


and
 showing
 around
 which
 was
 which
 was


one
 of
 a
 legendary
 moment
 yeah
 she


opened
 it
 right
 yes
 she
 opened
 it
 moving


on
 to
 culture
 so
 um
 family
 still
 owns


44%
 and
 you
 said
 that
 was
 the
 key
 to


surviving
 for
 200
 years
 um
 just
 what
 are


the
 disadvantages
 of
 having
 family


ownership
 or
 are
 there
 any
 so
 no
 I
 think


the
 the
 key
 is


um
 it
 creates
 a
 huge
 Capital
 discipline


but
 it
 also
 has
 a
 creates
 a
 blockage
 in


a
 way
 because
 you
 you
 don't
 naturally


want
 to
 dilution
 per
 se
 is
 a
 lot
 lot


harder
 to
 do
 mentally
 if
 you're
 if


you're
 a
 family
 that's
 that's
 held
 on
 to


so
 our
 shar's
 an
 issue
 today
 are


virtually
 the
 same
 as
 they
 were
 in
 1959


so
 that
 the
 only
 negative
 and
 everything


else
 is
 a
 positive
 that
 but
 but
 you
 you


you
 see
 that
 ability
 so
 Bruno
 schroer


sat
 around
 our
 boardroom
 table
 for
 60


years
 and
 he
 said
 to
 me
 pretty
 well
 at


every
 meeting
 get
 it
 right
 on
 a
 20-year


view
 now
 you
 still
 have
 two
 family


members
 on
 the
 board
 yeah
 but
 if
 we


hadn't
 have
 had
 that
 license
 to
 change
 I


don't
 think
 I
 would
 have
 had
 the
 license


to
 start
 the
 transition
 and
 the


inflection
 that
 we've
 done
 because
 we


had
 to
 transform
 otherwise
 we'd
 have


been
 one
 of
 those
 businesses
 that
 was


really
 struggling
 and
 not
 inves


investing
 to
 grow
 are
 you
 100%
 confident


that
 it's
 right
 to
 be
 independent
 yeah
 I


am
 actually
 I
 mean
 it's
 it's
 look
 there


an
 industry
 where
 the
 scale
 is
 getting


more
 and
 more
 important
 so
 our
 biggest


competitors
 Blackstone
 Black
 Rock
 have


got
 hugely
 bigger
 in
 this
 period
 but
 if


you
 want
 to
 be
 an
 active
 Alpha
 manager


scale
 is
 not
 everything
 doing
 a
 good
 job


for
 your
 clients
 is
 frankly
 the
 most


important
 thing
 because
 now
 in
 in


interrogation
 uh
 you
 know
 you
 added


actually
 uh
 yes
 I
 think
 I
 think
 it
 is


actually
 actually
 is
 a
 qualifier
 and
 it


means
 that
 you
 are
 normally
 not
 100%


sure
 no
 what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the
 things


that
 make
 you
 less
 sure
 about
 this
 well


I
 see
 the
 industry
 is
 going
 through


everybody's
 talking
 about
 who
 they
 merge


with
 and
 all
 the
 rest
 of
 it
 so
 so
 it
 is


a
 very
 active
 debate
 in
 our
 industry


today
 as
 to
 how
 people
 are
 going
 to
 get


to
 scale
 right
 so
 so
 and
 the
 most
 common


thing
 is
 people
 merging
 and
 everyone's


up
 for
 sale
 our
 view
 has
 been
 that
 you


can
 you
 can
 navigate
 that
 by
 investing


for
 growth
 growing
 these
 new
 businesses


and
 seeing
 your
 way
 through
 I'm
 cutely


aware
 that's
 a
 controversial
 statement


most
 people
 disagree
 with
 it
 so
 I
 think


I
 think
 you
 do
 have
 to
 qualify
 it
 but


for
 us
 we
 can
 we
 can
 achieve
 it
 because


of
 the
 family
 background
 would
 it
 make


sense
 to
 merge
 some
 of
 the
 UK
 players
 oh


if
 you're
 some
 of
 the
 smaller
 players


you
 probably
 do
 need
 to
 merge
 yourself


away
 because
 if
 you're
 a
 50
 70
 80
 100


200
 billion
 business
 you're
 not
 viable


to
 because
 you
 can't
 invest
 in
 a
 data


science
 you
 can't
 invest
 in
 the
 but
 at


770
 you
 think
 you're
 big
 enough
 what's


different
 about
 our
 770
 is
 that
 it's
 all


itive
 and
 it's
 all
 private
 and
 it's
 all


wealth
 it's
 all
 high
 fee


earning
 um
 Rich
 businesses
 not
 got
 a
 big


chunk
 of
 passive
 in
 there
 so
 I
 I
 think


that
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 much
 richer
 mix
 of


businesses
 than
 some
 of
 businesses
 which


look
 bigger
 than
 us
 but
 frankly
 they're


all
 passive
 moving
 on
 to
 sustainability


and
 ESG
 what
 do
 you
 make
 of
 the
 recent


swing
 in
 appetite
 for
 ESG
 well
 first


thing
 say
 it's
 been
 politicized
 so


that's
 so
 you've
 seen
 this
 huge


Geographic
 diversion
 yeah
 um
 and
 you've


you
 you
 absolutely
 have
 passed
 Peak


debate
 I
 mean
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't


want
 to
 talk
 about
 it
 now
 and
 you've


seen
 it
 but
 I
 think
 in
 borrs
 and


people's
 awareness
 of
 the
 importance
 of


climate
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 debated
 at


all
 so
 what
 companies
 are
 getting
 on
 and


doing
 is
 very
 real
 it's
 just
 people


spend
 a
 lot
 less
 time
 talking
 about
 it


so
 how
 do
 you
 think
 it
 will
 develop


going
 forward
 I
 think
 the
 first
 thing
 is


it
 it's
 gone
 from
 hand
 waving
 to
 data


and
 and
 in
 our
 industry
 there
 is
 a
 price


to
 pursuing
 sustainability
 you
 know
 so


so
 we
 we
 have
 to
 understand
 that
 if
 we


want
 if
 we
 want
 to
 be
 good
 at
 this
 and


we
 are
 we're
 in
 top
 three
 of
 of
 doing
 it


that
 comes
 at
 a
 ticket
 so
 a
 lot
 of


people
 have
 said
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 pay


that
 price
 um
 the
 second
 I
 think
 is
 that


we
 will
 get
 more
 and
 more
 regulation
 and


more
 and
 more
 fragmentation
 of


Regulation
 around
 the
 world
 and
 that
 is


a
 pain
 in
 an
 industry
 which
 is
 about


global
 scale
 so
 different


interpretations
 in
 Japan
 to
 Korea
 to


China
 ETA
 which
 all
 difficult
 um
 but
 I


if
 you
 come
 in
 a
 different
 way
 companies


uh
 report
 Gap
 profits
 right
 but


different
 companies
 put
 a
 different
 cost


on
 the
 external
 environment
 so
 if
 you're


a
 tobacco
 maker
 you
 create
 cancer
 if


you're
 an
 oil
 company
 you
 create
 carbon


emissions
 if
 you're
 a
 um
 uh
 a
 soft


drinks
 maker
 you
 create
 diabetes
 we


treat
 all
 those
 Gap
 profits
 as
 the
 same


the
 races
 are
 not
 the
 same
 right
 the


after
 the
 impact
 adjusted
 profits
 of


businesses
 are
 really
 very
 different
 I


think
 Society
 will
 increasingly
 look
 at


our
 businesses
 and
 say
 if
 you
 don't
 make


profits
 the
 same
 way
 we
 need
 to
 think


about
 investment
 in
 a
 different
 way


because
 the
 real
 impact
 adjusted
 profits


of
 P's
 portfolio
 differs
 and
 asset


managers
 sit
 there
 between
 asset
 owners


like
 yourself
 and
 asset
 creators
 and


companies
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 our
 job
 to


shine
 a
 light
 on
 what's
 the
 cost
 of


delivering
 that
 performance
 and
 if
 we


can't
 shine
 that
 light
 we're
 we're


failing
 in
 our
 duty
 you
 are
 the
 fifth


largest
 um
 foreign
 player
 in
 the
 Chinese


market


how
 do
 you
 see
 that
 going
 forward
 so


China's
 going
 through
 a
 a
 major


correction
 post
 um
 property
 crisis


you've
 seen
 huge
 growth
 in
 cash
 deposits


in
 Banks
 as
 as
 as
 this
 we
 the
 wealth


effect
 of
 the
 of
 the
 destruction
 is
 is


coming
 through
 but
 you're
 also
 seeing
 a


huge
 massive
 energy
 transition
 going
 on


in
 China
 and
 I
 I
 think
 you
 will
 see
 a


return
 to
 risk-taking
 at
 some
 point
 I


mean
 CH
 the
 Chinese
 have
 had
 a
 a
 huge


benefit
 of
 moving
 moving
 people
 from
 the


countryside
 to
 cities
 and
 that's
 given


them
 a
 productivity
 boost
 that


productivity
 boost
 isn't
 enough
 to
 carry


on
 into
 the
 future
 they
 need
 financial


productivity
 and
 to
 to
 Achieve
 Financial


productivity
 they
 probably
 need
 external


players
 in
 to
 help
 show
 them
 what
 good


Financial
 productivity
 looks
 like
 and
 a


a
 strong
 position
 there
 but
 running


wealth
 fund
 management
 fund
 management


assets
 private
 Equity
 assets
 I
 think
 is


is
 really
 additive
 for
 our
 future
 growth


but
 today
 it's
 Lo
 losing
 US
 money
 and


one
 of
 the
 bets
 that
 I've
 made
 that


hasn't
 been
 right
 has
 been
 the
 scale
 of


that
 bet
 but
 if
 you
 take
 a
 20
 of
 view
 be


delighted
 with
 it
 if
 you
 but
 in
 in
 a


world
 with
 increased
 geopolitical


frictions
 between
 the
 US
 and
 China
 for


instance
 um
 what
 are
 the
 dilemas
 of


being
 a
 large
 player
 in
 China
 for
 you


well
 it's
 really
 interesting
 isn't
 it


most
 us
 players
 have
 stopped
 talking


about
 their
 Chinese
 investments
 in
 their


in
 their
 public
 statements
 but
 they


haven't
 pulled
 back
 from
 their


activities
 on
 the
 ground
 because
 this
 is


one
 of
 the
 largest
 savings
 markets
 in


the
 world
 is
 a
 huge
 you
 know
 it's
 it's


second
 only
 to
 the
 US
 have
 you
 stop


talking
 about
 it
 or
 no
 we
 we
 we've
 said


very
 open
 about
 it
 because
 Yen
 Yen


Stenberg
 the
 who
 recently
 stepped
 down


as
 the
 Secretary
 General
 of
 NATO
 uh
 you


know
 he
 talks
 more
 vocally
 about
 um


thinking
 about
 defense
 and
 security


rather
 than
 just
 doing
 business
 and


profits
 h
 have
 your
 priorities
 changed


no
 I
 think
 the
 the
 reality
 of
 our


business
 is
 is
 you
 know
 we
 we
 will
 be
 a


taker
 of
 the
 geopolitical
 environment
 we


have
 to
 be
 sensitive
 to
 it
 and


governments
 will
 you
 know
 take
 take


whatever
 defenses
 defense
 decisions
 they


want
 to
 make
 I
 I
 personally
 think
 that


there
 is
 a
 huge
 opportunity
 for
 savings


growth
 in
 China
 and
 we
 should
 as
 a
 West


want
 to
 be
 engaging
 with
 that
 we
 want
 to


engage
 with
 them
 on
 Green
 transition
 we


want
 to
 engage
 with
 them
 on
 corporate


governance
 just
 as
 we
 do
 anywhere
 else


in
 the
 world
 and
 we
 should
 be
 if
 we


don't
 if
 we
 we
 got
 two
 choices
 as
 a


society
 we
 either
 walk
 past
 on
 the
 other


side
 of
 the
 road
 and
 say
 it's
 all
 too


difficult
 and
 it's
 horrible
 or
 we
 or
 we


cross
 the
 road
 and
 and
 and
 help
 and
 and


I
 think
 being
 part
 of
 the
 solution
 has


always
 been
 to
 my
 mind
 the
 right
 way
 of


doing
 it
 it's
 sometimes
 a
 lot
 braver
 and


harder
 but
 I
 think
 we
 don't
 engage
 we're


going
 to
 get
 what
 we
 deserve
 how
 does


India
 Look
 to
 You
 looks
 great
 at
 the


moment
 but
 let's
 be
 quite
 clear
 right
 CH


go
 back
 10
 years
 ago
 China
 was
 booming


and
 India
 was
 nothing
 anybody
 wanted
 and


now
 it's
 the
 other
 way
 around
 and
 I'm


sure
 in
 10
 years
 time
 it
 will
 move
 again


but
 the
 growth
 of
 the
 middle
 class
 the


The
 Innovation
 that's
 going
 on
 in
 India


is
 pH
 fanatical
 phenomenal
 but
 in
 our


industry
 it's
 a
 super
 tough
 one
 to
 we've


got
 we
 got
 price
 control
 from
 the


regulator
 um
 great
 savings
 but
 um
 in


aggregate
 we
 cannot
 Own
 100%
 of
 of
 an


Indian
 business
 which
 is
 a
 challenge
 but


we
 we've
 you
 know
 we've
 got
 a
 big


position
 in
 China
 we're
 also
 number


seven
 in
 India
 and
 the
 rest
 of
 Asia
 how


do
 you
 see
 that
 I
 think
 you
 got
 to
 look


country
 by
 country
 I
 mean
 fund
 o
 overall


it's
 it's
 clearly
 growing
 very
 strongly


but
 I
 think
 the
 most
 interesting
 one
 is


the
 corporate
 governance
 change
 going
 on


in
 Japan
 that
 that
 is
 a
 sleeping
 giant


of
 domestic
 savings
 corporates
 who've


never
 really
 got
 the
 message
 and
 bit
 by


bit
 that
 is
 changing
 and
 that
 that
 that


excites
 me
 talking
 about
 excitement
 um


what
 do
 you
 read
 a
 lot
 what
 one
 of
 one


of
 the
 greatest
 privileges
 is
 is
 is
 I'm


a
 judge
 of
 the
 Ft
 book
 of
 the
 year
 so
 I


read
 a
 lot
 of
 books
 about
 about
 business


so
 I'm
 my
 anything
 which
 is
 about


society
 today
 for
 me
 so
 so
 a
 brilliant


book
 just
 out
 the
 longevity
 imperative


that
 says
 we've
 get
 we're
 getting


ourselves
 thinking
 about
 longevity


completely
 the
 wrong
 way
 um
 Jonathan


Height's
 book
 about
 the
 impact
 of
 mobile


technology
 on
 children
 you
 know
 the
 the


stuff
 ravenous
 about
 about
 Food
 Systems


being
 broken
 around
 the
 world
 those
 are


the
 really
 big
 issues
 I
 think
 we
 face


can
 we
 give
 us
 some
 more
 titles
 you
 read


all
 these
 W
 Supremacy
 on
 on
 AI
 you
 Amy


Edmonson
 was
 was
 our
 winner
 last
 year


which
 you
 you
 you
 obviously
 covered
 in


your
 podcast
 which
 was
 a
 brilliant
 book


on
 on
 learning
 from
 failure
 and
 I
 think


there's
 so
 much
 great
 I
 mean
 there's
 so


many
 brilliant
 books
 being
 written


absolutely
 I
 just
 don't
 have
 enough
 time


to


read
 I
 agree
 um
 yeah
 we
 we
 do
 review
 a


lot
 of
 them
 on
 on
 LinkedIn
 so
 please
 uh


uh
 check
 it
 out
 there
 um
 who's
 been


important
 in
 your
 life
 in
 terms
 of
 a


mentor
 I
 think
 I
 think
 mentors
 are
 are


really
 valuable
 and
 I
 I've
 got
 several


um
 I
 I
 one
 one
 particular
 Mentor
 took
 me


took
 me
 out
 the
 other
 night
 and
 he
 said


what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 do
 and
 I
 said
 I'm


not
 sure
 if
 I'm
 going
 to
 have
 an


executive
 thing
 he
 said
 let
 me
 tell
 you


something
 you're
 no
 spring
 chicken
 you


shouldn't
 be
 thinking
 about
 being
 an


executive
 in
 your
 mid-60s
 give
 it
 up
 go


and
 do
 something
 more
 valuable
 and
 you


need
 you
 need
 people
 sometimes
 to
 take


and
 what
 would
 that
 be
 and
 so
 for
 you
 to


do
 something
 more
 valuable
 now
 uh
 after


November
 what
 would
 that
 be
 I
 I'm
 going


to
 I'm
 going
 to
 spend
 6
 months
 doing
 all


the
 things
 that
 I
 have
 never
 done
 before


and
 they
 are
 I
 I'm
 look
 I'm
 going
 to
 go


I
 spend
 a
 lot
 more
 time
 fishing
 I'm


going
 to
 spend
 a
 lot
 more
 time
 on
 the


water
 I'm
 going
 to
 spend
 a
 lot
 more
 time


reading
 and
 then
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 and
 do


some
 crazy
 things
 like
 grow
 flowers
 and


um
 go
 bird
 watching
 you
 name
 it
 I'm


going
 to
 do
 all
 this
 and
 then
 sounds


like
 typical
 English
 activities
 well
 no


I'm
 going
 to
 spend
 six
 month
 fishing


bird
 watching
 plants
 I'm
 going
 to


immerse
 myself
 in
 other
 stuff
 and
 out
 of


that
 I
 hope
 to
 come
 up
 with
 what
 I


should
 be
 doing
 afterwards
 I'm
 not
 going


to
 stop
 doing
 things
 but
 what
 I
 am
 clear


about
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 do
 something


executive
 sounds
 like
 a
 really
 good
 plan


uh
 Peter
 lastly
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to


young
 people
 so
 I
 think
 if
 I
 reflect


back
 do
 not
 assume
 that
 climbing
 the


greasy
 pole
 is
 the
 route
 to


being
 happy
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 people


look
 at
 the
 societal
 structures
 and
 say


I
 want
 to
 be
 more
 senior
 in
 organization


and
 all
 the
 rest
 if
 I
 look
 back
 I
 should


probably
 say
 the
 portfolio
 manager
 um
 if


I
 I
 think
 they've
 got
 to
 engage
 I
 think


a
 lot
 of
 them
 don't
 engage
 and
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 them
 need
 to
 look
 outside
 of
 the


algorithms
 that
 they
 are
 victims
 of
 and


they
 get
 fed
 the
 same
 stuff
 and
 people


stay
 in
 a
 very
 narrow
 pipe
 and
 I
 think


how
 do
 how
 do
 we
 how
 do
 we
 I
 it's
 a


mentorship
 program
 how
 do
 we
 help
 break


that
 cycle
 of
 saying
 there's
 one
 view
 of


society
 because
 I
 think
 people
 need
 to


think
 very
 differently
 about
 who
 they


really
 are
 and
 what
 they
 really
 want
 out


of
 life
 and
 I
 rather
 than
 just
 saying


it's
 about
 the
 next
 promotion
 well
 Peter
