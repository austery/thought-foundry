From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Wednesday,
 October
 22nd.
 Here's
 what


we're
 covering.


[Music]


>> Earlier
 this
 year,
 the
 Trump


administration
 began
 dramatic
 cuts
 to


foreign
 assistance
 around
 the
 world.


>> President
 Trump
 wants
 to
 shutter
 USID
 as


part
 of
 what
 he
 says
 is
 an
 effort
 to
 cut


bureaucracy
 and
 save
 Americans
 money.


>> And
 that
 sparked
 a
 lot
 of
 outcry.
 and
 he


betrayed
 the
 literal
 starving
 children


who
 rely
 on
 food
 from
 US
 aid
 to
 stave


off
 hunger.


>> And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 the
 administration


said
 in
 response,
 Secretary
 of
 State


Marco
 Rubio
 said,
 "No
 one
 is
 going
 to


die
 on
 my
 watch.
 No
 children
 are
 going


to
 die
 because
 of
 these
 cuts.


>> No
 one
 has
 died
 because
 of
 US


>> the
 people
 who
 have
 died
 as
 a
 result."


And
 so
 since
 that
 time,
 I've
 been


reporting
 from
 different
 countries
 that


were
 affected
 to
 essentially
 try
 to
 fact


check
 that
 statement.
 And
 what
 I
 found


is
 that
 there
 are
 some
 countries
 where


they've
 been
 able
 to
 cope
 without
 the
 US


resources.
 And
 then
 there
 are
 other


countries
 where
 the
 loss
 of
 US


assistance
 has
 really
 just
 been


catastrophic.
 And
 one
 of
 those
 countries


is
 Somalia.
 My
 colleague
 Stephanie
 Nolan


has
 covered
 global
 health
 for
 over
 30


years.
 She
 says
 that
 before
 the
 cuts,


the
 US
 was
 by
 far
 the
 largest
 donor
 to


Somalia,
 sending
 about
 $450
 million
 a


year
 in
 humanitarian
 assistance
 that


helps
 support
 the
 work
 of
 aid
 groups
 on


the
 ground.
 This
 month,
 the
 Trump


administration
 told
 the
 Times
 that
 it's


approved
 just
 under
 $15
 million.


Stephanie
 says
 the
 rapid
 withdrawal
 of


American
 funding
 has
 caused
 chaos
 in


Somalia's
 health
 system
 and
 forced
 aid


groups
 to
 close
 down
 dozens
 of
 food


assistance
 programs
 and
 community
 health


clinics.
 What
 they
 chose
 to
 keep
 open


were
 the
 centers
 that
 are
 like
 the
 last


line
 of
 defense.
 So
 that's
 for
 example


like
 emergency
 feeding
 centers
 for


critically
 malnourished
 children.
 And
 I


had
 the
 chance
 to
 spend
 some
 time
 in
 one


of
 those
 in
 the
 south
 of
 Somalia.
 You


get
 these
 little
 kids
 who
 are
 being


brought
 in
 and
 they're
 limp
 and
 their


eyes
 are
 huge
 in
 these
 really
 gaunt


faces
 and
 when
 they
 come
 in
 the
 door


they're
 being
 triaged.
 The
 very
 small


ones
 who
 are
 too
 weak
 to
 even
 eat
 and


drink.
 They're
 taking
 to
 put
 tubes
 up


their
 noses
 so
 they
 can
 have
 milk
 run


into
 their
 tummies.
 And
 you
 know,
 it's


really
 striking
 being
 in
 a
 ward
 full
 of


kids
 like
 this
 because
 it's
 a
 big
 packed


room
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 it
 and
 a


lot
 of
 sick
 kids,
 but
 it's
 really
 quiet.


like
 you
 just
 don't
 hear
 lots
 and
 lots


of
 children
 crying
 because
 they
 don't


have
 the
 energy
 to
 cry.


[Music]


I
 spoke
 to
 a
 doctor
 who
 was
 running
 one


of
 these
 centers
 and
 he
 said
 to
 me
 that


like
 what's
 really
 changed
 in
 the
 last
 6


months
 since
 the
 community
 health


programs
 disappeared
 along
 with
 the
 aid


budget
 is
 that
 there's
 just
 so
 many
 more


kids
 and
 when
 they
 get
 there
 they're
 so


much
 sicker.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 thing


that's
 really
 discouraging
 for
 them
 is


that
 they're
 aware
 that
 it
 doesn't
 have


to
 be
 like
 this.
 Like
 Somalia
 is
 a


country
 that
 has
 a
 terrible,
 terrible


drought
 problem
 and
 a
 huge
 amount
 of


instability
 and
 violence,
 but
 it
 was


still
 making
 progress
 on
 things
 like


immunization
 rates
 and
 lowering
 the
 rate


of
 mothers
 who
 died
 in
 childirth,


lowering
 the
 rate
 of
 children
 who
 died


under
 five.
 That's
 like
 really
 slow,


hard
 work.
 and
 it
 can
 be
 reversed


incredibly
 quickly.
 And
 so
 they're


thinking
 back
 to
 this
 progress
 they
 were


making
 and
 they're
 realizing
 that's


over.


Now,
 three
 updates
 on
 the
 Trump


administration.
 President
 Trump
 is


demanding
 that
 the
 Justice
 Department


pay
 him
 $230
 million
 as
 compensation
 for


federal
 investigations
 into
 him,


according
 to
 people
 familiar
 with
 the


matter.
 He
 made
 the
 claims,
 there
 are


two
 of
 them,
 through
 a
 process
 where


people
 can
 seek
 damages
 from
 the


government
 and
 try
 to
 reach
 a
 settlement


without
 a
 lawsuit.
 Trump's
 first


complaint
 alleges
 that
 his
 rights
 were


violated
 during
 the
 investigation
 into


possible
 connections
 between
 his
 2016


campaign
 and
 Russia.
 The
 second


complaint
 accuses
 the
 FBI
 of
 violating


his
 privacy
 when
 agents
 searched
 Mara


Lago
 for
 classified
 documents.
 Both


claims
 were
 filed
 before
 Trump
 was


reelected.
 According
 to
 Justice


Department
 regulations,
 there
 are
 two


people
 who
 can
 sign
 off
 on
 any


settlements
 like
 these.
 Both
 have
 close


ties
 to
 Trump.
 It's
 the
 deputy
 attorney


general,
 who
 used
 to
 be
 Trump's
 lead


defense
 attorney,
 and
 the
 chief
 of
 the


DOJ's
 civil
 division,
 who's
 represented


several
 Trump
 aids.
 When
 asked
 if
 either


would
 recuse
 themselves
 from
 weighing
 in


on
 any
 Trump
 settlement,
 a
 DOJ
 spokesman


said
 anyone
 involved
 would
 quote,


"follow
 the
 guidance
 of
 career
 ethics


officials."
 And
 when
 reporters
 asked


Trump
 about
 the
 situation
 yesterday,
 the


president
 admitted
 it
 is
 odd
 that
 he
 in


theory
 has
 sway
 over
 a
 potential
 payout.


>> It's
 awfully
 strange
 to
 make
 a
 decision


where
 I'm
 paying
 myself.
 In
 other
 words,


did
 you
 ever
 have
 one
 of
 those
 cases


where
 you
 have
 to
 decide
 how
 much
 you're


paying
 yourself
 in
 damages,
 but
 I
 was


damaged
 very
 greatly
 and
 any
 money
 that


I
 would
 get,
 I
 would
 give
 to
 charity.


Also
 in
 a
 reversal,
 President
 Trump
 now


says
 that
 he
 will
 not
 meet
 with
 Russian


leader
 Vladimir
 Putin
 in
 the
 coming


weeks.
 He'd
 said
 a
 few
 days
 ago
 that


they
 would,
 saying
 they'd
 had
 a


productive
 conversation
 and
 suggesting


the
 two
 would
 have
 a
 summit
 in
 Hungary


to
 discuss
 an
 end
 to
 the
 war
 in
 Ukraine,


but
 now
 Russia
 has
 signaled
 it
 has
 no


intention
 of
 striking
 a
 peace
 deal.
 And


a
 Kremlin
 spokesman
 said
 the
 meeting
 had


never
 been
 confirmed
 at
 all.
 Throughout


his
 term,
 Trump
 has
 sometimes
 courted


Putin,
 even
 complimenting
 him,
 and


sometimes
 threatened
 him,
 but
 has
 yet
 to


take
 any
 serious
 action
 to
 punish
 Russia


for
 its
 ongoing
 attacks
 on
 Ukraine.


And
 Trump's
 nominee
 to
 lead
 a
 federal


watchdog
 agency
 is
 out
 after
 Politico


reported
 that
 he'd
 sent
 a
 series
 of


racist
 text
 messages.
 The
 president
 had


selected
 Paul
 Ingracia,
 a
 far-right


lawyer
 and
 podcaster,
 to
 lead
 the
 office


of
 special
 counsel,
 which
 enforces
 some


ethics
 laws
 and
 safeguards


whistleblowers.
 But
 yesterday,
 after


several
 Republican
 senators
 signaled


they
 wouldn't
 vote
 for
 him
 amid
 growing


outrage
 over
 the
 texts,
 his
 bid


collapsed.
 According
 to
 Politico,


Ingrassia's
 messages
 included
 saying


Chinese
 and
 Indian
 people
 could
 not
 be


trusted,
 that
 the
 federal
 holiday


honoring
 Martin
 Luther
 King
 should
 be


tossed
 into
 the
 seventh
 circle
 of
 hell,


and
 quote,
 "I
 do
 have
 a
 Nazi
 streak
 in


me
 from
 time
 to
 time.
 I
 will
 admit
 it."


The
 Times
 was
 unable
 to
 independently


verify
 the
 texts.
 Ingrassia's
 lawyer


told
 Politico
 they
 may
 have
 been


manipulated
 or
 were
 missing
 context.


Ingracia's
 failed
 nomination
 comes
 just


a
 week
 after
 a
 separate
 Politico
 report


showed
 that
 leaders
 of
 young
 Republican


groups
 in
 multiple
 states
 regularly
 used


racist
 and
 homophobic
 language
 in
 their


chats,
 including
 joking
 about
 Hitler
 and


gas
 chambers.


[Music]


Across
 the
 US,
 a
 new
 outbreak
 of
 bird


flu
 is
 hitting
 dozens
 of
 poultry
 farms


and
 threatening
 to
 drive
 up
 prices
 at


the
 grocery
 store
 again.
 After
 cases


dipped
 this
 summer,
 farmers
 have
 now


reported
 an
 uptick
 of
 the
 disease,
 which


has
 killed
 nearly
 7
 million
 farmed
 birds


since
 the
 beginning
 of
 September.
 That


includes
 over
 a
 million
 turkeys
 just


ahead
 of
 Thanksgiving.
 One
 economist


told
 the
 Times
 that
 wholesale
 turkey


prices
 are
 already
 40%
 higher
 than
 last


year.
 Economists
 also
 expect
 egg
 prices


to
 go
 up
 again,
 just
 like
 they've
 done


in
 previous
 outbreaks.
 Bird
 flu
 often


flares
 up
 in
 the
 fall
 when
 wild
 birds


begin
 migrating
 south
 and
 spreading
 the


disease.
 But
 this
 year,
 because
 of
 the


government
 shutdown,
 states
 are


navigating
 the
 surge
 without
 the
 kind
 of


resources
 they'd
 normally
 get
 from
 the


CDC
 and
 the
 Department
 of
 Agriculture.


That's
 left
 local
 officials
 and
 farmers


without
 up-to-date
 guidance
 on
 how
 to


contain
 the
 disease
 or
 a
 clear
 national


picture
 of
 just
 how
 bad
 things
 are.
 In


the
 past
 few
 years,
 bird
 flu
 has
 not


only
 infected
 poultry,
 but
 has
 also


spread
 to
 dozens
 of
 other
 species,


including
 dairy
 cows
 and
 people,
 though


that
 risk
 remains
 low.


And
 finally,


at
 Yusede
 National
 Park,


>> never
 seen
 that
 before.


>> Base
 jumpers,
 the
 people
 who
 parachute


off
 of
 cliffs
 while
 the
 rest
 of
 us
 just


get
 sweaty
 palms
 watching
 them,
 are


going
 rogue
 under
 the
 government


shutdown.


>> Wow.


>> Base
 jumping
 is
 illegal
 in
 the
 park
 due


to
 safety
 concerns,
 but
 with
 a
 lot
 of


park
 staff
 furoughed,
 people
 may
 be


betting
 they
 just
 won't
 get
 caught.
 A


rock
 climber
 who
 was
 scaling
 the
 face
 of


El
 Capitan
 talked
 to
 the
 Times
 by
 cell


phone
 while
 1,000
 ft
 up
 in
 the
 air.
 He


said
 he'd
 seen
 20
 jumps
 off
 the
 rock


face
 on
 Friday
 alone.
 He
 caught
 footage


of
 some
 of
 them.
 Other
 videos
 have


showed
 up
 online
 of
 the
 daring
 jumps


becoming
 a
 kind
 of
 symbol
 of
 the
 chaos


that
 park
 employees
 were
 worried
 about


as
 some
 of
 the
 major
 national
 parks
 have


been
 left
 open
 even
 without
 as
 many


workers
 around.


Those

are
 the
 headlines
 today
 on
 the
 Daily.


The
 latest
 on
 the
 heist
 at
 the
 Louv.

 the
 New
 York
 Times


or

 your
 podcasts.
