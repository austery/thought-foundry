All
 right,
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


the
 All-In
 podcast.
 We
 are
 super
 pleased


to
 have
 with
 us
 today
 Senator
 Joe


Mansion
 is
 joining
 us
 today
 here
 on
 the


All-In
 Interview.
 And
 Chamath
 and
 I
 will


be
 interviewing
 him
 uh
 on
 his
 new
 book,


Dead
 Center
 in
 Defense
 of
 Common
 Sense.


A
 great
 book.
 Welcome
 to
 the
 program,


Joe
 Mansion.
 I
 know
 you
 like
 to
 be


called
 Joe.
 So,
 Joe,
 welcome
 to
 the


program.


>> Jason,
 thank
 you.
 And
 it's
 great
 to
 be


with
 you
 and
 Shamath
 and
 and
 I've


>> followed
 you
 all
 and
 you've
 been


unbelievable
 what
 you've
 put
 out
 and


some
 of the
 people
 you've
 had
 on.
 It's


been
 very
 entertaining,
 very
 interesting


and
 very
 thoughtful.
 So
 anxious
 to
 be


here.


>> Thanks.
 And
 we
 we
 have
 a
 tradition
 here.


I
 don't
 know
 how
 often
 you
 watch
 the


interview
 show,
 but
 we
 always
 try
 to
 get


a
 personalized
 gift
 for
 each
 of
 our
 um


our
 guests.
 And
 so
 I
 in
 the
 book
 you


talked
 about
 your
 first
 car,
 your
 19.


>> Oh,
 if
 I
 could
 if
 you
 could
 find
 that
 if


you
 could
 find
 that
 thing
 for
 me,
 it
 was


a
 bullet
 back.
 I
 can't
 find
 the
 car.


Well,
 there
 it
 is
 with
 the
 white


interior.


>> Oh
 my
 god.
 Where
 can
 we
 buy
 it?
 No.
 No.


We
 got
 it.
 It's
 in
 your
 driveway
 right


now.
 When
 you
 get
 out
 of
 your
 office


there,
 it'll
 be
 waiting
 for
 you
 by
 your


yacht.


>> Let
 me
 tell
 you
 that.
 Oh,
 by
 my
 yacht.


Yeah,
 I
 got
 a
 big


>> Oh
 my
 god.
 Has
 a
 $200,000
 trwler.


>> It's
 a
 fishing
 trwler.
 Correct.
 And
 it's


a
 trwler.


>> Joe,
 listen.
 Joe,
 what
 what
 Jason
 has


just
 proved
 is
 he
 has
 not
 read
 the
 book,


but
 he
 looked
 at
 the
 pictures
 in
 the


middle.
 That's
 all
 he's
 done.


>> No,
 I
 did
 the


>> He's
 ripping
 off
 the
 pictures
 in
 the


middle.
 No,
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 physical


book.
 I
 did
 the
 audio
 book.
 But
 Joe,
 you


did
 the
 right
 thing.
 You
 read
 it


yourself,
 which
 a
 lot
 of
 authors,
 you


know,
 they
 get
 try
 to
 get
 talk
 out
 of


doing
 it,
 but
 it
 makes
 it
 so
 much
 more


personal.


>> Hey,
 Jason,
 I
 didn't
 know
 I
 was
 supposed


to
 do
 that.
 And
 I
 And
 all
 of a
 sudden,


my
 daughter
 Heather
 says,
 "Dad,
 you
 got


to
 show
 up
 at
 the
 studio
 and
 start


reading
 your
 book."
 I
 says,
 "How
 how?"
 I


said,
 "Why
 do
 I
 have
 to
 do
 that?"
 She


says,
 "It's
 in
 the
 contract."
 I
 said, "I


didn't
 see
 that."
 She
 says,
 "I
 didn't


show
 it
 to
 you."


>> It's
 part
 of
 the
 contract.


>> It's
 like
 six
 or
 seven
 hours
 of
 reading.


>> It
 took
 20
 hours.
 20
 hours.


>> So,
 three
 days.
 Three,
 four
 days.


>> Four
 days.
 And
 let
 me
 tell
 you,
 it's
 the


best
 thing
 I've
 ever
 done.
 The
 make
 me


reminisce
 everything
 we
 put
 in
 the
 book.


>> It's
 just
 Chamati.
 You
 haven't
 done
 this


yet
 because
 you
 haven't
 written.


>> I
 don't
 I'm
 not
 really
 into
 audio
 books.


I
 read
 the
 book.
 Look,
 I
 have
 it.
 I
 I


like
 to
 have
 the
 physical
 pages.
 I
 mark


them.
 I


>> Okay.


>> I'm
 old
 school.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 sometimes
 I
 do
 both,
 but


you
 know,
 when
 you're
 in
 the
 session,


>> I'm
 sure
 you
 had
 this
 where
 the


producers
 got
 the
 button
 and
 then
 you're


like
 and
 you
 know,
 and
 then
 I
 got
 my


Maserati
 and
 I
 came
 out
 of
 the
 garage


and
 they're
 like,
 um,
 a
 garage.
 You're


like,
 yeah,
 I
 came
 out
 of
 the
 garage.


Like,
 a
 because
 you
 have
 to
 do
 every


word
 perfectly
 to
 sync
 it
 on
 Amazon,


right?
 So,
 they
 have
 to
 correct
 you
 over


and
 over
 again
 if
 you
 just
 miss
 one.
 The


most
 unbelievable
 thing
 is
 the
 first
 I


the
 first
 day
 I
 start
 doing
 it
 and
 I'm


sitting
 there,
 you
 know,
 and
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 I'm
 just
 talking
 and
 reading
 the


book
 and
 I
 cross
 my
 legs.
 They
 said,


"Stop.
 Cross
 your
 legs,
 didn't
 you?"
 I


said, "What?"
 They
 said,
 "We
 heard
 you


cross
 your
 legs."
 I
 said,
 "My
 god,
 I'm


in
 trouble.


>> You're
 basically
 in
 like
 a
 Faraday


cage."
 Like,
 if
 you
 literally,
 you
 know,


hit
 anything.


>> Yeah.
 Oh,
 wow.


>> But,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 book's
 fantastic.


Everybody
 go
 pause
 the
 uh
 podcast
 here


and
 I
 just
 absolutely
 go
 buy
 it
 because


it's
 so
 important
 and
 you
 know
 I


mentioned
 um
 when
 we
 were
 just
 on
 the


pre-show
 Irish
 Catholic
 Boy
 Scout
 and


you
 start
 the
 book
 out
 with
 an
 Irish


Catholic
 boy
 scout
 getting
 in
 a
 brewhaha


Donnie
 Brookke
 with
 an
 Italian


Irish
 boy
 scout.
 You
 an
 Eagle
 Scout?


>> No
 former
 president.


>> What?
 You
 were
 an
 Eagle
 Scout?
 That's


what
 the
 internet
 said.
 Where'd
 you
 get


to?
 First
 class.


>> No.
 No.
 I
 got
 up
 to
 I
 got
 up
 to
 life.


>> Oh.


>> And
 what
 happened?
 I
 was
 right
 next
 to


it.
 Let
 me
 tell
 you
 what
 happened.
 1959.


Never
 forget
 it.


>> The
 coal
 mines
 the
 coal
 mines
 got


automated
 in
 West
 Virginia.
 I
 lived


within
 I
 lived
 in
 little
 coal
 mining


community,
 400
 people.
 And
 there
 was


three
 of
 the
 largest
 coal
 mines
 you've


ever
 seen.
 And
 everybody
 worked
 in
 the


coal
 mines.
 Okay.
 And
 all
 of
 a
 sudden,
 I


come
 home
 one
 day
 and
 my
 dad
 had
 a


little
 furniture
 store.
 My
 grandfather


had
 a
 grocery
 store.
 And
 there
 was
 all


these
 guys
 sitting
 on
 the
 on
 the
 curb.


They
 got
 laid
 off
 because
 it
 got


automated.
 They
 lost
 their
 job.
 Pat


Keenir
 was
 my
 scout
 leader.
 The
 best
 of


the
 best
 of
 the
 best.
 If
 you
 have
 a
 good


scout
 master,
 scout
 leader,
 you're
 going


to
 make
 it.
 If
 you
 don't,
 you
 don't
 make


it.
 And
 what
 happened?
 He
 had
 to
 go
 to


Lordstown,
 Ohio
 to
 get
 a
 job
 in
 the
 auto


factory.
 And
 we
 lost
 it.
 And
 I
 was
 done.


>> You
 left
 scout
 master.
 Yeah.


>> I
 lost
 my
 guy.
 Oh,
 well,
 this
 part
 of


the
 of
 of
 your
 story,
 I
 think,
 is
 the


crucible
 moment
 for
 you
 because
 I've
 I'm


Catholic
 and
 Irish,
 and
 I
 know
 the


Italian
 Catholics,
 that's
 that's
 quite
 a


fight.


>> An
 Italian
 Catholic
 and
 an
 Irish


Catholic
 get
 in
 a
 fight.
 Just
 step
 back


is
 what
 I
 my
 best
 advice
 everybody.


>> But
 you
 got
 in
 a
 heater
 with
 Joe
 Biden


over
 the
 the
 bill
 back
 better
 bill.


>> Yeah.
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 like
 I
 believe


the
 Democrats
 or
 operatives
 were
 sending


people
 to
 your
 trwler,
 your
 your
 house


boat
 that
 you're
 living
 on,
 they're


sending
 people,
 you
 know,
 a
 little
 bit


out
 your
 family
 maybe


>> everywhere.
 I
 was
 and
 I
 had
 the
 death


threats
 were
 unreal,
 Jason.


>> Your
 own
 party.
 So
 maybe
 you
 could
 take


us
 to
 maybe
 tell
 that
 story
 because
 it


feels
 to
 me
 and
 correct
 me
 if
 I'm
 wrong


that
 this
 is
 a
 se
 seinal
 moment
 in
 your


political
 career
 or
 perhaps
 the


>> I
 don't
 recommend
 anybody
 getting
 caught


in
 a
 50/50
 Senate
 in
 the
 United
 States


because
 the
 United
 States
 Senate
 is


supposed
 to
 be
 the
 the
 the
 uh
 most
 u


deliberate
 body
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 the


reason
 it's
 deliberate
 because
 you
 have


to
 have
 a
 60
 vote
 threshold
 for
 closure


to
 get
 on
 to
 get
 on
 a
 bill.
 And
 with


that,
 that
 was
 intended
 from
 our


founding
 fathers
 is
 that
 the
 house
 is


going
 to
 be
 simple
 majority.
 218
 out
 of


435.
 Don't
 even
 talk
 to
 the
 other
 side.


You
 don't
 have
 to
 just
 shove
 it
 through.


And
 George
 Washington
 said,
 you
 know,


it's
 just
 going
 to
 be
 like
 a
 hot
 cup
 of


tea
 and
 it
 goes
 over
 to
 the
 Senate.


Should
 cool
 itself
 off
 so
 we
 can
 drink


it.
 Well,
 that's
 the
 whole
 premise.
 And


people
 keep
 saying,
 get
 rid
 of
 the


filibuster.
 That's
 the
 holy
 grail
 to


democracy
 as
 we
 know
 it.
 Because
 without


it,
 we
 wouldn't
 be
 the
 country
 we
 are


now.
 It
 forced
 us
 to
 sit
 down
 in
 one
 of


the
 bodies
 to
 s
 cal calm
 things
 down
 and


talk
 to
 our
 friends
 over
 in
 the
 House


and
 say,
 "Guys,
 this
 is
 how
 it's
 got
 to


be.
 We've
 got
 to
 moderate
 this
 some."


And
 that's
 what
 that's
 what
 it
 was


that's
 what
 I'd
 always
 known
 from
 Bob


Bird,
 Senator
 Robert
 C.
 Bird,
 our


senator
 forever,
 50
 years
 plus
 in
 West


Virginia.
 when
 I
 became
 governor,
 he


kept
 I
 think
 he
 kind
 of
 knew
 in
 his
 mind


that
 I
 would
 probably
 run
 for
 the
 Senate


and
 he
 was
 getting
 to
 the
 end
 of
 his


career
 or,
 you
 know,
 his
 age
 was


creeping
 up
 on
 him
 pretty
 pretty
 hard.


Anyway,
 he
 kept
 telling
 me
 all
 the


different
 things
 of
 why
 he
 did
 certain


things,
 why
 the
 rules
 were
 the
 way
 they


were.
 So,
 I
 had
 a
 real
 understanding
 of


the
 purpose
 of
 the
 Senate
 and
 my


responsibilities.
 So,
 here
 we
 go.
 And


then
 the
 the
 whole
 the
 whole
 thing
 on


reconciliation,


there's
 a
 reconciliation.
 It's
 it's
 a


movement.
 It's
 a
 that
 we
 operate
 under.


And
 it's
 basically
 stopping
 it
 stops


anybody
 from
 preventing
 us
 to
 make
 sure


we
 can
 take
 care
 of
 our
 financial


responsibilities.


And
 so
 reconciliation
 only
 takes
 a


simple
 majority.
 Well,
 in
 the
 Senate,


that's
 the
 only
 vehicle
 that
 you
 can


have
 a
 51
 vote
 threshold
 without
 a


closure
 vote
 of
 60
 votes
 getting
 to
 the


bill.
 So
 then
 Joe
 Biden
 gets
 elected
 and


I
 think
 the
 story
 in
 the
 book
 it
 starts


out
 Schumer
 kept
 calling
 me
 that
 all


every
 hour
 on
 the
 hour
 the
 night
 of
 the


election
 and
 I'm
 thinking
 why
 is
 he
 so


worked
 up?
 Because
 in
 the
 Senate
 in
 all


honesty
 whether
 you're
 in
 the
 m
 if


you're
 one
 of
 if
 you're
 not
 the
 majority


leader
 but
 you're
 one
 of
 the
 senators
 in


the
 caucus
 or
 the
 Dem
 Republicans
 you


have
 the
 same
 power
 you
 have
 the
 same


you
 know
 you
 can
 participate
 every


senator
 can
 participate.
 They're
 all


important
 100
 of
 them.
 So
 he
 keeps


saying,
 Joe,
 he
 says,
 you
 know,


understand
 this
 Georgia
 thing
 could


really,
 you
 know,
 it
 could
 happen.
 I'm


thinking,
 well,
 I
 don't
 think
 we're


going
 to
 win
 Georgia.
 We
 hadn't
 and
 then


wasn't
 predicted,
 but
 Donald
 Trump
 put


him
 in
 play
 to
 be
 honest
 with
 you.
 Him


going
 down
 there
 and
 getting
 into
 a
 tiff


with
 everybody.
 He
 did.
 And
 so
 all
 of
 a


sudden,
 you
 know,
 we
 got
 uh
 uh
 two


senators
 that
 are
 running
 from
 there.


And
 boom,
 the
 first
 one
 calls
 Raphael


Waro.
 He
 wins.
 Osafs
 later
 on
 that


night.
 Boom.
 They
 call
 that
 and
 Schumer


says,
 "You
 know
 what
 this
 means,
 don't


you?"
 And
 I
 said, "Well,
 Chuck,
 I
 think


it
 means
 you're
 the
 majority
 leader."
 He


says,
 "No,
 it
 means
 that
 you
 can


probably
 have
 anything
 you
 want."
 And
 I


said, "I
 just
 want
 my
 country
 to
 do


well.
 If
 my
 country
 does
 well,
 my
 state


will
 do
 well.
 That's
 all
 I
 care
 about."


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 he
 meant
 when
 he
 said


that?


>> I
 know
 exactly
 what
 he
 meant,
 Schmoth.
 I


know
 exactly.
 Chuck
 Schumer
 basically


coming
 from
 where
 he
 comes
 from.
 It
 just


whatever
 you
 can
 take
 back
 home.
 And
 of


course,
 Bob
 Bird
 was
 always
 criticized


for
 taking
 so
 much
 what
 they
 call
 pork


back
 home.


>> And
 that
 was
 the
 the
 situation
 he


thought,
 well,
 I'm
 in
 a
 cat
 bird
 seat


now.
 I
 could
 outdo
 Bob
 Bird.
 I
 just


never
 thought
 that.
 I
 just
 never
 thought


of
 tipping
 the
 scale
 so
 unfavorably
 to


where
 we
 all
 should
 be
 doing
 well
 if
 we


can
 move
 our
 country
 forward.
 But
 that's


what
 he
 thought.
 Okay,
 what
 do
 you
 want?


I
 just
 want
 my
 country
 to
 do
 well.
 When


that
 happened,
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of


thought
 that
 the
 filibuster
 and
 and


maybe
 just
 to
 take
 a
 step
 back
 for
 the


audience,
 the
 whole
 point
 is
 that
 as
 you


explained,
 basically
 laws
 can
 get
 passed


in
 one
 of
 two
 ways.
 The
 real
 way,
 which


is
 that
 you
 have
 to
 find
 some
 sort
 of


compromise
 with
 folks
 on
 the
 other
 side,


get
 to
 60
 votes,
 or
 the
 other
 way,
 which


is
 a
 more
 of
 a
 budgetary
 process
 called


reconciliation,
 which
 is
 a
 simple


majority.
 And
 there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 talk


that


one
 party
 at
 some
 point
 will
 try
 to


eliminate
 the
 filibuster
 so
 that
 when


they
 have
 a
 simple
 majority,
 they
 can


pass
 any
 law
 they
 want.
 And
 there
 was
 a


moment,
 I
 think,
 in
 that
 point
 where
 you


came
 under
 a
 lot
 of
 pressure
 to
 get
 on


board
 with
 trying
 to
 eliminate
 the


filibuster.
 Can
 you
 just
 give
 us
 a


window
 into
 that
 and
 what
 happened
 and


how
 you
 made
 the
 decision
 and
 what
 the


what
 the
 reaction
 was
 from
 party


loyalists?
 Well,
 let's
 go
 back
 to
 2013


when
 Harry
 Reid
 because
 of
 Barack
 Obama


couldn't
 get
 his
 appointments
 done
 for


his
 for
 his
 cabinet
 and
 things
 of
 that


sort
 and
 and
 some
 judges.
 So,
 the


majority
 party
 can
 change
 the
 rules.
 If


they
 want
 to
 blow
 it
 apart,
 they
 can


blow
 it
 apart.


>> Well,
 Harry
 Reid
 decided
 that
 he
 wanted


to
 get
 rid
 of
 the
 filibuster.


And
 uh
 I
 just
 said,
 Harry,
 I'd
 never
 do


that.
 I
 mean,
 my
 goodness,
 you
 can't


just
 because
 you
 can't
 work
 with


someone.
 I
 said,
 "You
 and
 Mitch
 don't


even
 sit
 down
 and
 talk.
 You
 don't
 have
 a


cup
 of
 coffee,
 let
 alone
 discuss
 what


should
 be
 important
 for
 both
 sides."
 And


at
 that
 time,
 I
 even
 told
 Harry,
 I
 said,


"Harry,
 the
 only
 thing
 that
 the


president's
 wanting


that
 he
 got
 he
 won
 re-election
 2012,


gets
 reappointed
 2013,
 reinaugurated,


and
 here
 we
 go."
 He
 wants
 to
 put
 his


team
 together.
 That's
 will
 and
 pleasure.


And
 I
 always
 believe
 that
 will
 and


pleasure
 that
 will
 and
 pleasure
 means


you're
 you
 get
 elected.
 You're
 the


executive
 Shimoth
 and
 you
 said,
 "Joe,
 I


want
 you
 to
 be
 part
 of
 this.
 I'm
 going


to
 come
 and
 go.
 It's
 your
 will
 and


pleasure.
 I'm
 not
 staying
 over.
 Once


you're
 gone,
 I'm
 gone.
 Why
 not
 let
 you


have
 your
 team
 unless
 I
 then
 they
 can
 do


a
 FBI
 background
 check,
 find
 out
 if
 I'm


of
 sound
 character
 and
 moral
 values
 and


no
 criminal
 records
 and
 boom,
 let
 me


go."
 So
 I
 I
 begged
 Harry
 just
 go
 over


and
 cut
 a
 deal
 with
 Mitch
 and
 say,


"Mitch,
 let's
 together
 do
 this


unanimously.
 That
 51
 vote
 threshold
 for


all
 of
 the
 president's
 appointment,


people
 that'll
 be
 will
 and
 pleasure,
 no


holdovers
 whatsoever.
 But
 you
 can't
 do


it
 to
 judges
 that
 get
 lifetime


appointments.
 You
 can't
 do
 it
 for
 other


other
 uh
 different
 agencies
 that
 have
 a


six-year
 or
 a
 nine-year
 term.
 Just
 will


and
 pleasure."
 And
 I
 I
 thought
 that


would
 be
 very
 simple.
 And
 he
 wouldn't
 do


it.
 They
 said,
 "Oh,
 no.
 We
 got
 to
 get


the
 judges.
 I
 says,
 "You're
 going
 to


basically
 change
 the
 confirmation


process
 to
 51
 votes
 for
 a
 lifetime?
 Are


you
 crazy?"


>> But
 they
 did
 it.
 And
 then
 guess
 what


happened?
 They
 did
 it
 for
 the
 They
 did


it
 for
 district
 and
 circuit
 judges.


Okay?
 Didn't
 do
 it
 for
 Supreme
 Court.


Guess
 what
 happened
 as
 soon
 as


Republicans
 took
 over?
 They
 were
 in


control.
 Mitch
 McConnell
 says,
 "Fine,


we'll
 do
 it
 for
 Supreme
 Court.
 Now
 we


have a
 63
 court."
 didn't
 work
 too
 well


before
 he
 did
 it.
 You
 know,
 whether
 it


be
 Harry
 or
 that.
 And
 during
 this,
 Chuck


Schumer's
 just
 come
 out
 directly
 and
 has


said
 he
 wanted
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 the


filibuster.
 That's
 how
 they
 were
 going


to
 run
 it
 with
 Joe
 Biden.
 Well,
 Joe


Biden
 had
 always
 been
 a
 defender
 of
 the


filibuster.
 How
 can
 you
 flip
 on
 your


values
 when
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 now
 because


you're
 in
 charge
 and
 you
 want
 to
 just


shove
 things
 down
 people's
 throat?
 I


said,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 do
 that.
 So,


myself
 and
 Kirsten
 Cinema
 voted
 against


the
 filibuster,
 which
 stopped
 all
 that.


I
 was
 all
 for
 the
 voting.
 I
 mean,
 all


the
 concern
 the
 voting
 act,
 voting


rights
 act,
 all
 that.
 But
 I
 said,
 we


have
 to
 find
 a
 pathway
 that
 we
 have
 some


Republicans,
 10
 Republicans
 that
 will


work
 with
 us.


>> I
 want
 to
 go
 and
 ask
 you
 a
 very
 specific


question
 that's
 that's
 framed
 in
 the


book
 about
 Obama.
 But
 before
 I
 do
 that,


let's
 just
 stay
 on
 Biden
 for
 a
 second.


>> I'll
 get
 to
 where
 where
 uh
 Jason
 asked


me
 how
 we
 got
 to
 because
 it
 really
 how


it
 led
 up
 to
 what
 happened
 is


unbelievable.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 think
 maybe
 finishing
 that


big
 battery.
 Go
 ahead.
 Yeah.
 because


it's
 it's
 gets
 spicy.
 Yeah,


>> it
 gets
 spicy
 because
 what
 happened,


Jason,


>> uh
 the
 first
 thing
 they
 did
 was
 a
 ARP.


The
 American
 Rescue
 Plan
 was
 his
 first


bill.
 Soon
 as
 Joe
 Biden
 gets
 elected,


boom,
 he
 gets
 sworn
 in
 and
 in
 February,


he
 comes
 out
 with
 the
 ARP,
 American


Rescue
 Plan,
 which
 is
 this
 big
 overhaul.


Okay,
 we
 had
 just
 done,
 you
 all
 know
 the


finances
 better
 than
 probably
 anybody


observing.
 We
 had
 put
 $3.2
 2
 trillion


dollars
 into
 the
 market
 as
 co
 in
 20
 in


2020
 March
 of
 from
 March
 2020
 up
 until


the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 and
 then
 Joe
 Biden


takes
 over.
 So
 we
 already
 put
 3.2


trillion.
 He
 comes
 out
 with
 the
 American


Rescue
 Plan.
 They
 want
 to
 put
 another


1.9
 minimum
 1.9.
 Now
 we're
 at
 5.1.
 Well,


our
 cash
 flow
 is
 about
 a
 little
 over
 $5


trillion
 a
 year
 that
 we
 run
 the
 country


on.
 They're
 doubling
 the
 amount.
 You


can't
 digest
 that.
 that
 the
 market
 can't


take
 it.
 But
 they
 were
 doing
 it.
 And
 I


says,
 "Are
 you
 people
 crazy
 right
 now?


We
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 what
 the
 3.2
 is


going
 to
 do,


>> let
 alone
 but
 they
 wanted
 it
 was
 they


were
 be
 chasing
 a
 social
 reform."
 And
 I


told
 him,
 I
 said,
 "Mr.
 President,
 they


heard
 me
 grumbling
 uh
 in
 the
 hallway
 and


one
 of the
 senators
 called
 the
 White


House
 immediately
 and
 says,
 "Mansion


making
 trouble
 already."
 Well,
 it
 was


50/50.
 They
 had
 to
 have
 me.
 say,
 "Call


me
 right
 over
 to
 the
 White
 House."


>> And
 I'm
 sitting
 there.
 I
 said,
 "Mr.


President,
 I'm
 begging
 you,
 please
 don't


do
 the
 don't
 do
 reconciliation
 on
 this


bill.
 If
 this
 is
 your
 bill,
 which
 I
 know


it's
 not,
 this
 is
 a
 Bernie
 Sanders
 and


this
 is
 Elizabeth
 Warren
 cuz
 I'd
 heard


them
 respectfully.
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 can


agree
 in
 some
 and
 I
 disagree,
 but
 it
 was


just
 too
 big
 a
 bite
 coming
 right
 out
 of


co
 and
 we
 had
 a
 vaccine
 that
 was


working."
 So
 I
 said,
 "Please
 don't,


sir."
 And
 I
 said,
 "You're
 the
 only
 one


on
 the
 stage
 running
 for
 president
 with


all
 that
 big
 lineup
 that
 says,
 you
 know


how
 the
 place
 work.
 You
 can
 work
 on
 both


sides.
 You
 can
 make
 a
 deal."
 And
 I


always
 known
 you
 to
 be
 that
 person.


>> And
 now
 all
 of
 a
 sudden,
 you're


throwing,
 you
 know,
 the
 nuclear
 bomb


out.
 You're
 saying,
 "We
 can't
 work
 with


the
 Republicans.
 We
 got
 to
 do
 it."


>> And
 I
 said,
 "Sumer's
 got
 you
 all
 fired


up
 thinking
 that's
 how
 you're
 going
 to


run
 it."
 And
 I
 knew
 in
 my
 mind
 they


wanted
 to
 run
 that
 what
 we
 call
 the


117th
 Congress.
 The
 Congress
 is
 a


two-year
 stint.
 Every
 two
 years
 you
 have


an
 election.
 So,
 Congress,
 we
 were
 in


117th,
 just
 starting
 it.
 My


my
 uh
 thought
 process
 was
 is
 that


Schumer
 had
 convinced
 the
 president
 that


we
 could
 run
 this
 Congress
 for
 two
 years


with
 four
 reconciliation
 big
 bills,
 two


in
 two
 in
 2021
 and
 two
 in
 2022.


>> And
 I
 says,
 over
 my
 dead
 body,
 that's


not
 going
 to
 happen.
 That's
 not
 what


we're
 here
 for.
 And
 that's
 not
 how
 this


place
 is
 supposed
 to
 work.
 So
 they


called
 me
 over
 in
 the
 White
 House
 and


they
 grabbed
 you
 always
 Jason.
 You're


sitting
 there
 and
 you
 see
 it
 on


television.
 They
 made
 everybody
 leave


the
 room
 and
 we're
 sitting
 there
 and


then
 president
 reaches
 over
 and
 grabs


your
 arm
 and
 he
 says,
 "Joe,
 your
 country


needs
 you."


>> I'm
 thinking,
 "What
 the
 hell
 do
 I
 say


now?"
 And
 I
 said, "Mr.
 President,"
 and
 I


grabbed
 his
 arm.
 "Country
 needs
 you,


too.
 It
 needs
 us
 all."
 And
 I
 said, "Sir,


I'm
 begging
 you
 not
 to.
 Why
 don't
 you


just
 put
 this
 bill
 that
 you
 call
 your


American
 Rescue
 Plan?
 Put
 it
 in
 the


jurisdictional
 committees
 and
 let
 us


work
 it.
 Give
 us
 a
 shot
 clock.
 Say,


"Guys,
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 you
 60
 days
 to


work
 this
 these
 bills."
 Then
 if
 you
 They


don't
 because
 they
 just
 don't
 want
 you


to
 have
 any
 success
 at
 all.
 Do
 what
 you


got
 to
 do
 then.
 Oh,
 no.
 Got
 to
 do
 it


now,
 Joe.
 Got
 to
 go.
 Got
 to
 go.
 Okay.


So,
 we
 go.
 And
 then
 we
 shut
 it
 down


there
 for
 about
 12
 or
 14
 hours
 one
 day


cuz
 I
 thought
 they
 lost
 their
 mind.
 They


wanted
 to
 expand
 the
 unemployment


benefits.
 I
 said,
 "Do
 you
 understand


what
 you're
 dealing
 with
 now?
 you
 got


inflation
 coming
 at
 you
 so
 hard
 because


people
 have
 been
 cooped
 up.
 We've
 sent


everybody
 a
 check.
 And
 I
 told
 him
 this,


he
 kind
 of
 giggled.
 I
 said,
 I
 said,
 "Mr.


President,
 we've
 sent
 everybody
 a
 check.


And
 if
 we've
 missed
 anybody,
 it
 was
 by


mistake
 cuz
 you
 intended
 to
 send


everybody
 a
 damn
 check."
 And
 I
 said,


"They
 want
 to
 go
 spend
 money
 and
 there's


nobody
 working.
 The
 supply
 chains
 are


shut
 down.
 There's
 nothing.
 They're


going
 to
 pay
 exorbitant
 amounts
 to
 get


what
 they
 want.
 You're
 just
 fueling
 it,


sir."
 Oh
 god.
 We
 went
 through
 all
 of


that
 and
 he
 that's
 when
 he
 got
 pretty


vulgar
 and
 just
 told
 me
 I'm
 going
 to


you're
 going
 to
 you
 know
 if
 you
 you
 kill


my
 effing
 bill


I'll
 never
 talk
 to
 you
 again.
 I
 said
 if


I
 could
 kill
 this


>> if
 I
 could
 kill
 this
 effing
 bill
 you


shouldn't
 talk
 to
 me
 again
 because
 if
 I


could
 I
 would
 but
 I
 can't
 the
 way
 you


things
 is
 moving
 but
 I
 can
 tell
 you


we're
 never
 going
 to
 go
 this
 way
 route


again.


>> So
 this
 is
 how
 we
 work
 kind
 of
 work


things
 out.
 Then
 sure
 enough
 one
 month


they
 come
 back
 with
 BBB.


>> Yeah.
 build
 back
 better.
 Now
 they're


talking
 $6
 trillion.
 That
 bill
 was
 10


trillion
 if
 it
 was
 a
 penny
 with
 all
 the


revamping.
 I
 couldn't
 get
 there,
 guys.


And
 I
 told
 him,
 I
 said,
 "Mr.
 President,


I'm
 sorry,
 man.
 I
 can't
 get
 there."
 And


they
 tried
 for
 eight
 months,
 beat
 up on


me.
 I
 mean,
 I
 had
 to
 have
 security.


>> What
 is
 that?
 What
 is
 that
 like?
 Like,


what
 does
 the
 pressure
 campaign
 look


like?
 It's
 because
 it's
 not
 just
 the


president
 exactly
 as
 you
 write
 in
 the


book.
 It's
 people
 showing
 up
 at
 the


house.
 It's
 people
 with
 little
 kayaks


with
 protest
 signs
 around
 your
 boat.


It's
 pretty
 intense.


>> It's
 pretty
 intense.
 But
 I
 can
 tell
 you


one
 thing.
 When
 every
 day
 uh
 the
 Capitol


police
 call
 you
 and
 says
 your
 death


threats
 are
 serious
 enough
 right
 now,
 so


we
 have
 to
 have,
 you
 know,
 we'll
 meet


you
 down
 at
 where
 you
 live
 and
 we'll


bring
 you
 to
 work
 and
 we'll
 take
 you


back
 home.
 You
 know,
 things
 are
 pretty


serious.
 I
 never
 wanted
 to
 know
 the


extent,
 but
 I
 knew
 they
 were
 serious.


And
 then
 one
 time
 they
 said,
 "This
 is


really
 getting
 serious
 now
 because
 now


we
 got
 things.
 They
 know
 where
 your


children
 go
 to
 school.
 They
 know
 where


your
 grandchildren
 are,
 where
 your
 kids


live."
 And
 I'm
 thinking,
 "Oh
 my
 god,


this
 is
 crazy."
 And
 then
 I
 had
 a
 bunch


of
 Boers
 come
 down,
 canoers.
 I
 had
 I
 got


attacked
 by
 canoes.
 And
 I
 just
 said,


"Guys,
 listen.
 We
 just
 disagree."
 It
 was


all
 climate
 people.
 And
 I
 said,
 "Listen,


I
 I
 want
 a
 clean
 climate.
 I
 just
 know
 we


need
 energy
 to
 run
 our
 country,
 and


there's
 got
 to
 be
 a
 balance."
 And
 uh
 so


I
 said,
 "Come
 up
 to
 my
 office."
 They


said,
 "What?"
 I
 said,
 "Come
 to
 my
 office


tomorrow.
 We
 can
 sit
 and
 talk.
 You
 don't


have
 to
 be
 out
 here
 in
 the
 water."
 But


they
 thought
 that
 was
 the
 show
 they
 put


on.
 But
 they
 came
 the
 next
 day.
 We


talked.
 We
 agreed
 to
 disagree
 on
 some


things
 and
 we
 agreed
 on
 some
 things.


>> But
 Joe
 Joe,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 understand


though,
 like
 do
 do
 you
 think
 that
 these


are
 just
 random
 acts
 or
 do
 you
 think


that
 it's
 it's
 an
 organized
 pressure


campaign?


>> I
 think
 it
 was
 organized.
 They
 were
 paid


Shamath
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 friends
 who


live
 on
 the
 down
 at
 the
 river
 on
 the


PTOIC
 River
 with
 me
 on
 the
 boat
 they


they
 played
 like
 how
 can
 I
 get
 a
 job


with
 you?
 How
 can
 I
 do
 this
 if
 I
 want
 to


protest?
 They
 say
 oh
 just
 sign
 up
 and


get
 $15
 an
 hour.
 I
 couldn't
 believe
 it.


I
 couldn't
 believe
 it.
 They
 were
 telling


me
 that.


>> But
 doesn't
 the
 message
 have
 to
 go
 from


the
 White
 House?
 Like
 doesn't
 Biden's


team
 somebody
 has
 to
 say
 like


>> oh
 no
 Ron
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 honest
 with


you.
 strong
 claim,
 okay?
 Smart
 guy,
 good


guy
 and
 everything,
 but
 he
 had
 gone
 so


far
 to
 the
 left
 and
 he
 pushed
 Joe
 left


cuz
 I
 kept
 telling


>> when
 I
 first
 went
 over
 to
 the
 White


House,
 I
 said,
 "Mr.
 President,"
 I
 says,


"You
 have
 the
 most
 liberal
 staff
 that


I've
 ever
 seen."
 First
 time
 I
 went
 over.


>> And
 he
 said,
 "Well,
 Joe,
 they
 tell
 me
 I


have
 the
 most
 diversified
 staff."
 I


said,
 "We're
 not
 talking
 about


diversity,
 sir.
 We're
 talking
 about
 bat


crazy.
 We're
 talking
 about
 people
 I've


known,
 I've
 worked
 with
 in
 the
 hallway


forever,
 and
 I
 know
 where
 they
 came
 and


where
 they
 worked
 before.
 These
 are


people
 real
 far
 left.
 And
 Ron
 put
 that


team
 together.
 And
 I
 I
 know
 that
 because


I
 kept
 saying
 that
 your
 staff
 is
 pushing


you
 too
 far
 left,
 Mr.
 President.
 You've


never
 been
 that
 far
 left.


>> Right.


>> And
 I
 just
 Someone
 says
 about,
 you
 know,


I've
 I've
 always
 liked
 Joe
 Biden.
 We


always
 got
 along
 well.
 Good
 man.


>> I
 just
 don't
 think
 he
 lost
 the
 will
 to


fight.


>> Okay.
 Do
 you
 think
 it's
 that
 or
 can
 I


can
 I
 just
 ask
 you
 all
 of
 these
 rumors,


the
 comments
 about
 the
 autopen,
 the


mental
 faculties?


>> Never
 saw
 that.
 Never.
 and
 I've
 been


with
 him
 a
 lot.
 Okay,
 we
 always
 had
 good


conversations.
 Now,
 with
 that
 said,
 I


just
 said,
 I
 know
 how
 much
 energy
 it


takes
 if
 you've
 got
 to
 fight
 with
 your


staff
 every
 day
 to
 do
 the
 things
 you


want
 rather
 than
 the
 staff
 saying,


"We'll
 take
 care
 of
 that,
 Mr.


President."
 Because
 I
 would
 ask
 him,
 we


agree
 on
 something,
 and
 I'd
 ask
 him
 a


week
 or
 two
 later,
 and
 nothing
 had


happened.
 So,
 I
 know
 there
 was
 no


followup.
 You
 follow?
 So,
 I
 knew
 Ron
 was


kind
 of
 driving
 the
 train.
 And
 and
 uh


with
 that,
 I'll
 tell
 you
 how
 this
 thing


came
 to
 to
 a
 head.
 They
 didn't.
 I
 said,


"I'm
 not
 voting
 to
 get
 on
 the
 BBB."
 And


this
 goes
 on
 for
 a
 while.
 There's
 just


pressure
 and
 pressure
 me
 and
 they
 need


my
 vote
 to
 even
 get
 on
 reconciliation.


>> Right.
 Right.


>> So,
 it
 finally
 came
 down
 to
 I
 said,
 you


know,
 you've
 got
 some
 good
 things
 in


that
 BBB
 bill.
 The
 one
 thing
 you
 really


need
 is
 infrastructure.
 Remember
 the


bipartisan
 infrastructure
 bill?


>> Yeah.


>> I
 said,
 this
 country,
 we
 haven't
 done


anything
 for
 30
 years.
 I
 said,
 why
 don't


you
 just
 let's
 pull
 that
 bill
 out.
 So,


Schumer
 being
 the
 person
 he
 is,
 he
 said,


I'll
 tell
 you
 what
 I'll
 do,
 Joe.
 I'll


pull
 that
 bill
 out.
 And
 I
 said,
 "Let
 me


work
 that
 bill,
 Chuck."
 And
 I
 said,


"We'll
 get
 you
 a
 good
 bill
 and
 it'll
 be


bipartisan.
 I'll
 show
 you
 can
 be
 done


bipartisan."
 He
 says,
 "I'll
 tell
 you


what.
 I'll
 do
 that
 and
 pull
 that
 out
 if


you'll
 vote
 to
 get
 on
 BBB."


So,
 the
 reason
 I'm
 leading
 up
 to
 this,


that's
 when
 people
 say,
 "Well,
 Joe


promised
 to
 vote
 for
 it."
 I
 never


promised
 to
 vote
 for
 BBB.
 I
 says,
 "I'll


get
 on
 and
 let
 you
 work
 the
 bill.
 I'm


never
 going
 to
 be
 for
 this
 bill."


So
 anyway,
 we
 get
 we
 we
 get
 the
 be
 we


get
 the
 bipartisan
 infrastructure
 bill.


We
 work
 it
 and
 we
 pass
 it
 and
 the
 night


we're
 passing
 the
 bill
 sitting
 on
 the


Senate
 floor,
 Bernie
 Sanders
 says,
 "Come


over
 and
 talk
 to
 me,
 Joe."
 And
 I
 sit


down.
 He
 said,
 "Joe,
 are
 you
 going
 to


vote
 for
 this
 BBB
 bill?"
 And
 I
 said,


"Hell
 no,
 Bernie.
 You
 know,
 I
 was
 never


been
 for
 that
 bill."
 And
 he
 says, "Well,


at least
 you're
 being
 honest
 with
 me."
 I


said, "I've
 been
 honest
 with
 everybody."


I
 said, "You
 guys
 want
 to
 work
 it
 until


the
 cows
 come
 home?
 That's
 fine.
 I
 can't


do
 this."


>> And
 he
 says,
 "You
 know,
 I've
 cut
 it
 down


from
 six
 some
 from
 6
 trillion
 to
 three


Detroit.
 I
 says,
 Bernie,
 you
 and
 I
 know


the
 game
 that's
 played
 here.
 You
 didn't


cut
 it
 down.
 All
 you
 did
 was
 cut
 the


timing
 down
 from
 10
 years
 to
 5
 years
 or


3
 years
 to
 make
 it
 look
 like
 you
 were


cutting
 them
 out.
 You
 know,
 they're


never
 going
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 any
 of
 this


once
 you
 start
 giving
 everything
 away,


>> right?


>> Went
 through
 all
 of
 that.
 So,
 he
 says,


you
 know,
 I
 can
 kill
 this
 bill.
 And
 I'm


thinking
 at
 first
 when
 he
 said
 that,
 I


says,


"Well,
 Bernie,
 if
 you're
 saying
 you
 can


kill
 the
 bill
 here
 in
 the
 Senate
 and
 and


you're
 and
 and
 Vermont
 doesn't
 need
 any


infrastructure,
 your
 bridge,
 roads
 and


bridges,
 internet
 connections,
 your
 your


water
 and
 sewer
 line,
 everything's


great,
 then
 you
 should
 vote
 against
 it."


He
 said,
 "No,
 I'm
 not
 talking
 about


here,
 Joe.
 I'm
 talking
 about
 on
 the


other
 side
 in
 the
 House
 with
 all
 the


liberals
 or
 the
 progressives
 over


there."
 So,
 I
 didn't
 think
 of
 anything.


We
 passed
 it
 that
 night
 and
 boom,
 the


bill
 gets
 held
 up.
 You
 remember
 that?


>> They
 kept
 getting
 held
 up
 and
 they
 kept


sending
 the
 president
 up
 there
 to
 talk


to
 him
 and
 pass
 the
 bill


>> and
 they
 wouldn't
 pass
 it
 and
 they
 kept


saying
 Mansion
 lied
 to
 us.
 And
 I
 said,


"Shumer,
 you
 better
 tell
 them
 the
 truth.


You
 know
 exactly
 how
 you
 got
 on
 this


bill
 and
 you
 know
 I
 never
 ever
 said
 I


would
 ever
 vote
 for
 this
 bill."


>> Let
 me
 Joe,
 if
 it's
 possible,
 I
 want
 to


just
 go
 a
 little
 bit
 back
 and
 I
 want
 to


start
 with
 Obama.
 So
 you
 wrote
 in
 the


book
 that
 Trump
 was
 the
 most
 engaged


president
 you
 ever
 worked
 with
 and
 that


in
 the
 first
 I


>> said
 two
 of
 them
 two
 two


>> two
 of
 them
 okay
 and
 then


>> Clinton
 Bill
 Clinton


>> if
 you
 told
 me
 people
 that
 are
 engaging


with
 you
 and
 talk
 Bill
 and
 uh
 and


President
 Trump


>> and
 then
 you
 said
 in
 the
 first
 two
 years


you
 spoke
 with
 Trump
 more
 than
 you
 ever


did
 under
 eight
 years
 of
 Obama.


>> Correct.
 Correct.
 contrast
 and
 compare


Obama
 and
 Trump
 for
 us
 and
 just
 help
 us


understand
 the
 positives
 and
 negatives


of
 both
 as
 you
 saw
 it.
 I
 think
 pres


President
 Barack
 Obama
 is
 a
 very
 good


man,
 you
 know,
 and
 and
 but
 his
 politics,


I
 knew
 him
 when
 he
 was
 a
 US
 senator


representing
 Illinois
 and
 he
 knew
 about


the
 coal
 industry
 and
 I
 you
 of
 course
 I


come
 from
 the
 coal
 industry
 being


governor
 of
 West
 Virginia
 and
 growing
 up


in
 in
 the
 coal
 fields
 and
 we
 talked


about
 fossil
 and
 why
 we
 needed
 this
 that


and
 everything.
 He
 wanted
 me
 to
 help
 him


and
 vote
 for
 something
 that
 would
 help


his
 called
 uh
 uh
 future
 gen,
 which
 is


the
 new
 uh
 coal
 fired
 plant
 that
 was


going
 to
 be
 uh
 CO2
 capture
 and
 all
 this


and
 that.
 They
 called
 it
 back.
 That
 was


a
 billion.
 It
 was
 a
 billion
 dollar


project.
 The
 government
 was
 sponsoring


and
 I
 told
 him
 I
 couldn't
 participate.
 I


was
 one
 of the
 four
 states
 I
 pulled
 out


and
 put
 my
 support
 behind
 and
 they
 got


it.
 Never
 built
 the
 plant,
 but
 they
 got


the
 the
 award.
 So,
 I
 knew
 he
 knew
 it.


And
 then
 all
 of a
 sudden
 he
 becomes
 a


number
 he
 becomes
 the
 the
 nominee
 from


the
 Democratic
 party
 and
 switched


everything
 to
 to
 renewables.


And
 I'm
 thinking,
 well,
 what
 are
 we


going to
 do
 with
 all
 the
 things
 that
 the


coal
 miners
 have
 done
 and
 all
 we've
 done


for
 our
 country?
 Does
 that
 mean
 you're


going
 to
 bring
 new
 jobs
 or
 this
 or
 that?


There
 was
 no
 plan
 to
 replace
 any


opportunities
 to
 live
 the
 quality
 of


life
 and
 to
 live
 where
 they
 wanted
 to


live
 with
 it
 their
 culture
 and
 and
 and


who
 we
 are
 and
 family
 oriented
 in
 the


Appalachia.


And
 boy,
 I'll
 tell
 you,
 we
 had
 a
 meeting


about
 one
 year
 afterwards
 and
 I
 was
 uh


in
 the
 National
 Governance
 Association


leadership
 and
 we
 had
 Democrats
 and


Republicans.
 I
 finally
 got
 a
 meeting


with
 him
 in
 the
 Roosevelt
 room
 and
 I'll


never
 forget
 that.


and
 uh
 and
 we
 were
 going
 around
 the


table
 and
 different
 governors
 were


speaking.
 He
 came
 to
 me
 and
 I
 says,
 "Mr.


President,
 you've
 done
 one
 hell
 of
 a


good
 job
 at
 villainizing
 Cole."
 And
 he


jumped
 up
 and
 it
 went
 nuts
 on
 me.
 I'm


thinking,
 "Woo
 boy,
 here
 we
 go."
 And
 he


said, "Why
 would
 you
 say
 something
 like


that?"
 And
 I
 said,
 "Because
 it's
 true."


I
 says,
 "You
 have
 basically
 put


benchmarks
 that
 we
 can't
 make
 because


there's
 no
 technology
 that
 we
 can
 get


our
 industry
 to
 meet
 those
 that
 gives


you
 the
 right
 to
 shut
 it
 And
 he
 made
 a


statement,
 if
 you
 recall,
 go
 ahead
 and


build
 a
 coal
 fired
 plant
 and
 we'll
 break


you.
 He
 knew
 that
 we
 technology
 wasn't


there.
 So
 I'm
 thinking,
 Christ,
 what


happened?
 You're
 leaving
 us
 behind.


>> These
 people
 have
 nothing.
 They
 and
 they


they
 said,
 "What
 happened
 to
 the
 West


Virginia
 Democrats?"
 I
 said,
 "I
 tell
 you


exactly
 what
 happened.
 They
 ran
 them


off.


>> Now
 all
 of a
 sudden
 they've
 done


everything
 like
 a
 returning
 Vietnam


veteran.
 We've
 done
 everything
 our


country's
 asked.
 Now
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


we're
 not
 good
 enough,
 clean
 enough,


green
 enough,
 or
 smart
 enough.
 They
 hell


with
 them.
 Just
 don't."
 by
 the
 wayside.


So
 you
 remember
 the
 slogan
 don't
 leave


anybody
 behind.
 At
 least
 Joe
 Biden


picked
 up
 that
 slogan
 in
 2020
 and
 he
 has


did
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 there
 trying
 to


have
 incentives
 to
 bring
 businesses
 into


coal
 country
 if
 you
 will.


>> So
 is
 it
 that
 Obama
 is
 just
 a
 an


incredibly


strategic
 political
 calculator?


>> He
 was
 elusive.


>> He's
 elucid.


>> What
 does
 that
 mean
 as
 a
 politician?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,
 I
 just,
 you
 know,


when
 I
 talked
 to
 Bill
 Clinton,
 you
 know,


it's
 always,
 it
 was
 always
 what
 about


this
 and
 he
 was
 always
 so
 inquisitive


about
 this
 and
 that,
 what
 I
 was
 thinking


about
 this
 and
 that.
 Then
 we
 always
 had


a
 couple
 good
 jokes
 to
 tell
 each
 other


and
 kind
 of
 broke
 eye,
 you
 know,
 we
 had


a
 lot
 of
 fun.
 And
 with
 with
 and
 with


President
 Donald
 Trump,
 you
 know,
 you
 go


meet
 him,
 he's
 charming
 as
 can
 be.


>> Sits
 down,
 talks
 with
 you.
 He
 says,


"Hey,
 Joe,
 what
 about
 this?


>> What
 about
 that?"
 No.
 And
 you
 know,
 we


talk
 about
 a
 lot
 of
 things.
 And
 then
 one


time
 I
 told,
 "Mr.
 president,
 just
 call


me
 last.
 I
 was
 the
 only
 Democrat
 he
 was


talking
 to.
 Come
 over,
 have
 breakfast,


come
 over
 lunch
 or
 do
 whatever,
 come
 to


a
 movie.
 And
 uh
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 fun
 and
 and


I
 said,
 "Just
 call
 me
 last."
 He
 said,


"Why
 you
 say
 that?"
 I
 said,
 "I
 don't


know
 who
 in
 the
 hell
 you
 talk
 to
 last,


but
 that
 seems
 what
 happens.
 I'd
 like
 to


have
 one
 of
 those
 dates."


less
 stuff.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 your
 this


profiling
 courage
 around
 spending


and
 entitlements


in
 the
 book
 you
 talk
 about
 comes
 from


this
 rugged
 individualism,


personal
 responsibility.


>> Accountability.


>> Yeah.
 And
 this
 accountability
 that
 you


grew
 up
 with.


>> Yeah.
 As
 a
 as
 a
 Catholic
 as
 well.
 You
 I


had
 that
 as
 well.
 A
 little
 bit
 of
 guilt


if
 you
 don't
 work
 hard
 as
 well
 sprinkled


in
 there
 to
 as
 a
 back
 stop.
 We're


looking
 at
 a
 country
 now
 where
 it
 seems


uh
 the
 the
 operating
 principle
 is
 how
 do


I
 get
 mine?
 Hey,
 you
 got
 something.
 I


need
 to
 get
 something.
 And
 now
 you've


got
 Mandami
 in
 New
 York.


>> He's
 going
 to
 give
 free
 pizza
 and
 bagels


and
 bus
 trips
 and
 whatever
 it
 is,


whatever
 people
 want,
 he's
 going
 to
 give


it
 to
 them
 for
 free.


>> Yeah.
 You
 have
 not
 been
 able
 to
 failed


in
 some
 ways
 to
 turn
 this
 around
 in
 the


country
 this
 entitlement
 as
 many
 of
 us


have
 who
 have
 been
 screaming
 from
 the


rooftops
 like
 ask
 not
 you
 talk
 about


this
 in
 the
 book
 ask
 not
 what
 your


country
 can
 do
 for
 you
 what
 can
 you
 do


for
 your
 country
 you
 bring
 it
 up
 and


over
 again


>> so
 I
 think
 we
 failed
 in
 the
 last
 two


decades
 and
 socialism's
 on
 the
 rise
 why


is
 that
 how
 do
 we
 turn
 it
 around


>> let
 me
 just
 say
 the
 last
 at
 the
 BBB
 the


last
 time
 President
 Trump
 President
 uh


Biden
 I
 had
 met
 where
 He
 calls
 me
 up


into
 the
 White
 House
 and
 he
 takes
 me
 up


in
 stairs
 to
 the
 living
 quarters
 and
 boy


but
 when
 you
 go
 up
 there
 that's
 really


going
 to
 the
 woodshed
 if
 you
 will
 and
 we


were
 talking
 and
 everything
 and
 I
 said


Mr.
 President
 I
 can't
 get
 there.
 I


really
 can't
 get
 there
 sir.


>> And
 I
 said
 you
 know
 you
 and
 I
 are
 both


at
 the
 same
 vintage.
 You're
 a
 little
 bit


older
 but
 not
 that
 much.
 I
 said
 we're


we're
 in
 the
 same
 vintage.
 And
 I
 said,
 I


remember
 very
 vividly
 as
 a
 13-year-old


kid
 watching
 television,
 inauguration


196
 of
 John
 Kennedy
 asked
 not
 what
 your


country
 can
 do
 for
 you,
 what
 you
 can
 do


for
 your
 country.


If
 we
 pass
 this
 piece
 of
 legislation,


you're
 asking
 me
 to
 vote
 for
 the
 BBB,


>> you're
 changing
 the
 psychic
 to
 the


nation
 of
 how
 much
 more
 can
 my
 country


do
 for
 me?
 I
 wasn't
 born
 that
 way.
 I


wasn't
 raised
 that
 way.
 I
 don't
 believe


that
 way,
 and
 I
 can't
 do
 it.
 You
 could


put
 a
 gun
 to
 my
 head
 and
 say,
 "I'm
 gonna


pull
 it
 pull
 the
 trigger.
 I
 can't
 vote


for
 it."
 And
 then
 all
 hell
 broke
 loose


after
 that.
 So
 how
 it
 happened
 is
 this.


My
 my
 grandmother
 took
 everybody
 in.


Okay?
 We
 lived
 by
 the
 railroad
 tracks


between
 the
 creek
 and
 the
 railroad


tracks
 in
 a
 little
 three-
 room
 garage


apartment.
 And
 my
 grandparents
 had
 a


little
 home
 right
 beside
 us.
 She
 took


everybody
 in.
 I
 never
 knew.
 I
 just


watched
 and
 I
 I
 was
 eldest
 of
 the
 of
 the


boys
 of
 about
 20
 of
 us
 grandkids.
 We
 had


to
 whitewash
 her
 basement,
 keep
 it
 clean


and
 a
 nice
 place
 for
 people
 to
 stay.


There
 was
 no
 social
 social
 network
 back


in
 the
 50s.


We
 had
 people
 that
 would
 ride
 the
 train.


You
 can
 call
 what
 you
 want
 to.
 These


were
 people
 that
 fallen
 out
 of
 society.


They
 were
 all
 intelligent,
 smart


craftsman,
 this
 and
 that.
 And
 they
 they


and
 alcoholics
 probably
 most
 of
 them.


And
 they'd
 come
 down.
 They
 knew
 he
 could


go
 off
 and
 go
 to
 a
 mama
 and
 she'd
 take


care
 of
 them.
 She
 said,
 "I
 got
 three


rules.


Can't
 you
 can't
 uh
 you
 can't
 drink.


>> You
 can't
 swear.
 and
 you've
 got
 to
 work.


So
 my
 first
 introduction
 was
 there
 was


rules
 and
 they
 were
 all
 good
 rules.


>> Pretty
 basic
 operating
 system.


>> Okay.
 So
 you
 know
 what
 after
 about
 a


while
 they'd
 be
 we
 had
 some
 of
 the
 best


painters
 and
 carpenters
 you
 ever
 seen


but
 we'd
 lose
 them
 every
 now
 and
 then.
 I


said
 okay
 we
 had
 names
 for
 everybody.
 We


had
 Willbar
 Willie
 Pegle
 Peggy.
 You
 name


it
 we
 had
 them.
 They
 were
 all


characters.


>> Oh
 peg
 leg
 peggy
 especially.


>> He
 had
 a
 peg
 firecracker.
 He
 had
 a
 peg


leg,
 a
 wooden
 peg
 leg,


>> and
 he
 got
 caught
 in
 the
 was
 in
 my


building.
 He
 got
 caught
 in
 the
 tracks


one
 time.
 We
 had
 to
 pull
 him
 out.


>> Anyway,


>> so
 I
 said,
 "Mom,
 okay,
 what
 happened
 to


Dloid?
 Where'd
 Lloyd
 go?"
 "Oh,
 honey,


he's
 on
 a
 toot
 again."
 And
 you
 know
 the


toot
 was
 always
 the
 bottle.
 And
 when
 you


see
 the
 old-timers
 on
 the
 tooth,
 they
 go


like
 this.
 Uh
 and
 I
 says,
 she
 said,


"Don't
 worry,
 honey.
 He'll
 be
 back
 in


six
 weeks."
 And
 he
 just
 the
 cycle.
 That


was
 it.
 So
 I
 learned
 that
 my
 grandfather


people
 come
 in
 and
 papa,
 my
 grandfather


never
 kept
 books.
 He
 just
 kept
 all
 his


money
 in
 his
 pocket.
 He
 worked.
 That's


how
 he
 worked.
 Immigrant
 from
 Italy.
 And


papa
 say,
 "Uh,
 they
 come
 and
 say,
 "Hey


pop,
 no matter
 who
 they
 were,
 "Hey
 papa,


can
 I
 borrow
 five?
 Can
 I
 have
 five?"
 He


said,
 "Sure,
 honey."
 Called
 everybody


honey.
 He
 said, "Here's
 a
 broom
 and


shovel.
 Go
 up
 and
 clean
 the
 parking
 lot


and
 I'll
 give
 you
 the
 five."
 I


understood
 you
 had
 to
 do
 something
 for


the
 five.
 Okay.


>> Right.


>> He
 he
 says
 they
 say,
 "Papa,
 I'll
 be


right
 back."
 He
 looked
 at
 me
 and
 he


smiled.
 He
 said, "Don't
 worry,
 Joe."
 He


said,
 "Only
 about
 half
 of
 them
 take
 me


up
 on
 it."
 So
 I
 knew
 I
 knew
 you
 had
 to


do
 something.
 Now
 that's


>> that's
 a
 filtering
 mechanism.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 it
 relates
 directly
 to
 your
 belief


though
 in


>> having
 a
 work
 requirement.


>> I
 wanted
 a
 work
 requirement
 for
 anybody


capable
 able-bodied
 to
 work.
 And
 here's


the
 thing.
 They
 got
 on
 me
 said
 MMsion's


killing
 child
 tax
 credits.
 I
 says
 I'm


killing
 child
 tax
 credits.


>> Right.


>> First
 of
 all,
 you
 have
 child
 tax
 credits


up
 to
 $400,000
 of
 income.
 You
 really


want
 to
 know
 who
 needs
 the
 child
 tax


credits?
 people
 right
 above
 the
 poverty


guideline,
 mostly
 single
 females,
 above


25,000
 a
 year
 up
 to
 about
 75.
 They
 need


it,
 okay?
 And
 they're
 working.
 Please


help
 them.
 Okay?
 And
 I'd
 go
 into
 all
 of


this,
 Jason
 and
 Shimoth,
 and
 then
 and


then
 they
 and
 they
 said,
 "Oh,
 no.
 We
 got


to
 do
 this,
 that,
 across
 the
 board."
 I


said,
 '
 Don't
 you
 think
 that
 rather
 than


just
 sending
 checks
 to
 people
 that
 have


children
 that
 don't
 work
 and
 won't
 work


and
 sitting
 at
 home,
 why
 would
 they
 need


child
 care
 money
 when
 they're
 sitting


home
 with
 their
 ch
 children?
 I
 said,


that
 makes
 no
 sense
 to
 me
 at
 all.
 I


can't
 go
 home
 and
 explain
 it.
 And
 my


northstar
 has
 been
 this
 as
 long
 as
 I've


been
 in
 political
 life.
 if
 I
 can't
 go


back
 to
 my
 little
 hometown
 of
 Farmington


or
 the
 people
 I
 grew
 up
 with
 and
 explain


it
 cuz
 I
 knew
 they
 wouldn't
 let
 me
 get


by
 with
 anything.
 They'd
 hold
 your
 feet


to
 the
 fire
 and
 that's
 where
 that's
 how


it
 is
 and
 never
 changed.


>> Do
 you
 think
 that
 we're
 now
 in
 sort
 of


this
 intractable
 period
 where
 there


can't
 be
 any
 centism?
 There
 can't
 be


this
 idea
 that
 you
 work
 and
 then
 you


earn
 something
 that
 there's
 that
 dignity


of
 work.
 Instead,
 it's
 these
 extremes


that
 are
 constantly
 about
 what
 giveaway


can
 I
 give
 to
 people
 to
 get
 them
 on
 my


side.
 Is
 that
 where
 we
 are?


>> Let
 me
 give
 you
 the
 other
 thing
 about
 me


and
 Bernie
 one
 time
 talking
 and
 Bernie


wanted
 free
 tuition,
 right?
 Always


wanted
 free
 tuition
 and
 then
 they


finally
 they
 thought,
 well,
 we
 got
 we'll


get
 it
 free
 if
 we
 go
 junior
 colleges.
 I


says,
 I'm
 not
 for
 anything
 free.
 I'm
 for


earning
 it.
 Here's
 what
 I'm
 going
 to


tell
 you.
 If
 first
 they
 talked
 about


free
 college.
 I
 says
 I
 says
 Bernie
 my


son's
 at
 that
 time
 40ome
 years
 old.
 I


said
 my
 son's
 40
 years
 old.
 If
 you
 had


free
 education,
 free
 tuition,
 he'd
 still


be
 in
 school.
 He
 liked
 it
 so
 much.
 I


said
 he
 liked
 it
 so
 much
 he'd
 still
 be


there


>> later.


>> So
 anyway,
 I
 said
 no,
 I'm
 not
 for
 that.


And
 I
 so
 I
 said,
 let
 me
 tell
 you
 about


free.
 If
 we
 if
 we
 identified
 skill
 sets


that
 we're
 need
 and
 we
 can
 teach
 them
 in


junior
 colleges,


have
 them
 sign
 up,
 get
 a
 Stafford
 loan,


guaranteed
 federal
 loan,
 they
 don't
 pay


it
 back
 until
 basically,
 you
 know,
 until


they
 finish
 their
 education.
 So,
 if
 they


finish
 in
 two
 years,
 they
 took
 a


Stafford
 loan,
 they
 took
 what
 they


needed
 to
 get
 educated
 on,
 they
 took
 a


Stafford
 loan
 in
 a
 two-year
 community


college,
 they
 get
 a
 degree
 in
 a
 skill


set,
 we
 forgive
 it.
 They've
 earned
 it.


You
 didn't
 give
 it
 on
 the
 front
 end.


Because
 let
 me
 tell
 you
 what
 happens
 on


the
 front
 end.
 Only
 half
 of
 them
 ever


get
 through
 maybe
 a
 25%.
 You
 know,
 they


go
 for
 four
 years,
 you
 know,
 and
 you
 I


don't
 know if
 you
 know
 how
 they
 give


money.
 There's
 no
 financial
 literacy


required
 at
 all.


>> You
 all
 have
 to
 do
 is
 show
 the
 income
 of


your
 family
 and
 you're
 they
 have
 a
 a


scale
 they
 go
 by
 or
 you
 can
 get
 12,000
 a


year.
 You
 might
 only
 need
 four.
 I'll


guarantee
 you.
 You
 tell
 a
 kid
 that
 comes


from
 poverty
 and
 you
 tell
 them
 they
 can


get
 12,000,
 they'll
 take
 it
 all.


>> They're
 going
 to
 take
 it
 all.
 They
 don't


know
 what
 they
 don't
 know
 what
 acred


interest
 is.
 They
 don't
 know
 about


paying
 this
 back.
 It's
 a
 death
 trap.


They
 don't
 know
 any
 of
 that.
 They
 drop


out
 in
 two
 years
 for
 one
 reason
 or


another.
 Then
 it
 all
 comes
 due.
 They
 had


had
 a
 payment
 up
 until
 then.


>> No
 one's
 explaining
 anything.
 And
 I
 said


told
 Elizabeth
 Warren,
 I
 says,
 "Liz,


can't
 we
 just
 change
 the
 Stafford


program
 to
 where
 you
 have
 to
 have


financial
 literacy?
 You
 cannot
 get
 a


loan
 without
 financial
 literacy."


>> What
 was
 her
 answer?


>> I
 It
 didn't
 happen.
 Let's
 just
 put
 it


that
 Yeah,
 put
 it
 that
 way.
 What
 what's


driving
 I
 mean
 I
 understand
 populism,
 I


understand
 trying
 to
 buy
 votes,
 but
 what


at
 the
 core
 in
 your
 opinion
 drives
 these


individuals
 who
 think
 that
 not
 learning


to
 sustain
 yourself
 in
 society
 and
 to


get
 all
 of
 these
 freebies?


What's
 in
 their
 mind?
 What
 are
 they


missing
 about
 just
 the
 basic
 human


condition
 that
 we
 have
 to
 work
 for


stuff?
 the
 the
 human
 operating
 system
 is


we
 need
 challenges
 and
 when
 you
 don't


have
 purpose
 in
 life
 it's
 it's
 a
 road


it's
 that's
 the
 primrose
 path
 it's
 not
 a


a
 good
 place
 to
 go
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 mind


it's
 devil's
 playground
 as
 my


grandmother
 would
 say
 rest
 in
 peace


>> let
 me
 say
 to
 both
 of
 you
 all
 about
 what


has
 happened
 in
 this
 political
 process


and
 I've
 come
 to
 the
 conclusion
 we
 need


to
 have
 term
 limits
 and
 I'm
 going
 to


tell
 you
 how
 I
 came
 to
 that
 conclusion


when
 I
 was
 a
 governor
 I
 was
 doing
 a
 town


hall
 meeting
 in
 southern
 west
 Virginia
 a


little
 lady
 got
 stood
 up
 in
 the
 back
 and


she
 said
 Joe
 I
 wish
 you
 were
 for
 term


limit
 And
 I
 said,
 "Well,
 tell
 me
 why,


Suz."
 I
 I
 knew
 her
 and
 Susie,
 I
 said,


"Tell
 me
 why."
 She
 says,
 "Well,
 I
 just


think
 this
 would
 be
 it'd
 be
 better
 for


us
 to
 have
 turnover."
 And
 I
 says,
 and
 I


wasn't
 for
 it.
 And
 I
 I
 gave
 her
 all
 the


reasons.
 I
 said,
 "You're
 going
 to
 lose


your
 most
 experienced
 people
 with
 the


talent
 and
 know
 how."
 Boom,
 boom,
 boom.


I
 went
 through
 everything.
 She
 said,


"Joe,
 think
 of
 it
 this
 way.
 If
 we
 had


term
 limits,
 maybe
 we
 get
 one
 good
 term


out
 of
 you."


I
 had
 no
 comeback.
 She
 convinced
 me


right
 there.
 And
 from
 that
 point
 on,


I've
 been
 for
 term
 limits.
 And
 I'm
 more


for
 it
 today
 than
 I've
 ever
 been
 for
 it.


And
 I'm
 I'm
 And
 the
 reason
 I'm
 telling


you,
 yeah,
 maybe
 we'd
 get
 one
 good
 term


where
 you'd
 have
 the
 courage
 to
 do
 the


conviction
 with
 the
 oath
 you
 took
 to


defend
 and
 protect
 the
 Constitution,
 do


the
 job,
 put
 country
 before
 party,
 quit


playing
 this
 game,
 quit
 worrying
 about


getting
 reelected.
 And
 it's
 gotten
 to


the
 point
 now
 public
 service
 truly
 when


he
 said
 John
 Kennley
 says
 the
 most


noblest
 of
 all
 profession
 public
 service


that's
 gone.
 It's
 fame
 and
 fortune
 now.


I
 get
 in
 there
 I
 can
 keep
 turnurning
 it


and
 churn
 it
 and
 churning
 it.
 And
 I've


just
 said
 that
 basically
 the
 Senate
 two


six-year
 terms
 is
 enough.
 12
 years
 is


enough.


>> Let's
 actually
 look
 inside
 the
 political


parties
 for
 one
 second.


>> Oh
 boy.


>> Let's
 start
 with
 maybe
 an
 easy
 one,
 but


it's
 actually
 quite
 maybe
 a
 nuanced


answer.
 Tell
 us
 who
 you
 think
 are
 the


two
 most


dynamic
 senators,
 one
 Democrat,
 one


Republican.


>> I
 was
 thinking
 about
 that
 because
 if
 I


was
 you,
 I
 would
 have
 been
 asking
 the


same
 question.
 I
 I
 can
 I
 can
 name
 six
 or


seven
 on
 both
 sides.


>> Oh,
 please.
 Yeah,
 let's
 take


>> Yeah,
 let's
 go.


>> And
 when
 I'm
 saying
 that,
 people
 that


I've
 worked
 with,
 I
 know
 I
 know
 their


DNA.
 Okay.


>> Yeah.
 First
 of
 all,
 I'm
 going
 to
 always


be
 always
 be
 u
 differential
 to
 former


governors.


A
 governor
 can't
 afford
 to
 be
 a
 governor


of
 one
 side.
 And
 I'll
 give
 you
 the
 most


perfect
 simplest
 answer
 to
 that
 is
 that


pothole
 that
 busted
 my
 tire
 and


basically
 bent
 my
 rim
 and
 messed
 my
 car


up
 did
 not
 have
 a
 Democrat
 or
 Republican


name
 on
 it.


>> But
 I
 was
 responsible
 for
 making
 sure


the
 repairs
 on
 the
 roads
 didn't
 do
 that.


Okay.
 So
 you
 like
 Senator
 King,
 Angus


King
 from
 Maine,
 former
 governor.
 You


have
 Mark
 Warner,
 Virginia,
 former


governor.
 Tim
 Kaine,
 former
 governor.


You
 have
 Jean
 Shaheen,
 former
 governor.


Maggie
 Hassan,
 former
 governor.
 You
 have


Mike
 Rounds,
 former
 governor.
 John


Hovind,
 former
 governor.
 Lisa
 Marowsky


and
 Susan
 Collins
 were
 always
 my
 go-to


people
 on
 the
 Republican
 side.
 And
 Mitt


Romney,
 two
 of
 three
 of
 the
 best
 of
 the


best.
 You
 could
 always
 work
 with
 them


because
 they
 were
 always
 looking
 to
 do


the
 right
 thing.
 They
 didn't
 care
 about


politics.
 And
 then
 I
 always
 had
 you
 got


Senator
 Cortez
 Masto,
 you
 have
 uh
 you


know
 there's
 so
 many
 Jackie
 Rosen
 on
 the


Tom
 Tillis
 on
 the
 on
 the
 Senate
 side
 on


the
 Republican
 side.
 Bill
 Cassidy
 is
 one


of
 the
 best
 of
 the
 best.
 Bill
 Cassidy
 is


bright,
 sharp,
 always
 wanting
 to
 do
 the


right
 thing,
 always
 very
 very
 articulate


and
 he
 will
 get
 down
 to
 the
 nitty-gritty


and
 go
 into
 the
 depths
 of
 it
 to
 find
 out


an
 answer.
 And
 you
 got
 Mike
 Rounds,


former
 governor,
 great
 guy.
 South


Dakota.
 These
 are
 people
 that
 I
 know


have
 the
 ability
 to
 do
 it,
 to
 make
 it


happen.
 You
 just
 got
 to
 push,
 push,


push.
 I
 was
 asked
 a
 question
 the
 other


day,
 uh,
 Shamath,
 about
 what
 would
 you


do,
 Joe,
 if
 you
 were
 still
 there?
 If
 I


was
 king
 for
 a
 day
 and
 I
 had
 the
 ability


to
 use
 the
 Roosevelt
 room
 in
 the
 White


House,
 I'd
 bring
 him
 over.
 I'd
 put
 him


in
 the
 room.
 I'd
 put
 Schumer
 and
 put


John
 Thun
 and
 put
 his
 their
 teams


together
 and
 say,
 "Guys,
 you're
 not


getting
 out
 till
 you
 come
 to
 a
 deal.


This
 is
 not
 that
 hard."
 Here's
 what


we're
 not
 Everybody's
 wanting
 to
 blame.


Who's
 whose
 fault
 is
 it?
 Let's
 let's


look
 at
 whose
 responsibility
 it
 is.
 Not


fault.
 Whose
 responsibility?


My
 friends
 in
 the
 Republican
 party
 have


the
 trifecta.


President's
 Republican,
 House
 is


Republican,
 Senate's
 Republican.
 You


have
 the
 mantle.
 You
 have
 the
 agavel.


You've
 got
 to
 keep
 the
 keep
 the
 train


running.
 You
 got
 to
 keep
 this
 place


open.
 And
 I've
 said
 this,
 I
 know
 that


the
 president
 has
 the
 ability
 to
 do


that.


But
 you
 you
 can't
 always
 have
 politics


driving
 the
 end
 result
 to
 do
 your
 job,


and
 that's
 to
 keep
 it
 open.
 But
 I've


never
 voted
 for
 a
 shutdown.
 I've
 gotten


caught
 in
 a
 couple
 shutdowns,
 but
 I


never
 voted
 for
 them.
 and
 they're
 tough


to
 get
 out
 of
 because
 people
 get


ingrained
 and
 get
 they
 get
 in
 like


there's
 se
 feeder
 and
 cement
 can't
 get


out.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 president
 has
 to


move
 this
 and
 I've
 said
 this
 our
 great


country
 and
 the
 president
 with
 his


leadership
 over
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 is


able
 to
 get
 Hamas
 and
 the
 Israelis
 to


sit
 down
 and
 make
 a
 deal.
 Surely
 to
 God


I
 know
 the
 president
 can
 get
 a
 Democrat


and
 Republicans
 to
 make
 a
 deal.
 I
 know


that.
 But
 everybody's
 got
 to
 quit


playing
 the
 politics
 because
 of
 what
 the


what
 the
 outcome
 of
 the
 26
 election.


It'll
 take
 care
 of
 itself.


>> Which
 group
 hates
 each
 other
 more,


>> Democrats,
 Republicans,
 or


>> Oh,
 that's
 a
 good
 question.
 Yeah,


>> I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 like
 which
 one
 hates


each
 other
 more
 in
 your
 opinion.


>> It's
 a
 shame.
 Let
 me
 tell
 this
 is
 such


an
 easy
 lift.
 You
 know
 what
 happened


with
 this
 healthcare
 thing?


>> I
 was
 right
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 this
 whole


thing.
 I
 know
 exactly
 when
 they
 did
 the


Affordable
 Care
 Act
 and
 you
 remember
 in


2017
 that
 um
 John
 McCain
 made
 the
 famous


vote
 voted
 down.
 Okay.
 Yep.
 Yep.


>> I
 was
 in
 the
 back
 hallway
 when
 all
 that


unfolded
 back
 of
 the
 Senate
 before
 John


came
 out
 and
 made
 his
 vote
 and
 John
 been


getting
 pressured
 heavily
 by
 the
 White


House
 President
 Trump
 and
 his
 staff
 by


that
 at
 that
 time.
 John
 finally
 walked


out
 and
 getting
 ready
 to
 walk
 out
 and
 he


was
 sitting
 there
 and
 I
 came
 through
 the


hallway
 and
 I
 said,
 "John,
 listen.
 I'm


not
 crazy
 about
 this
 Affordable
 Care
 Act


the
 way
 it
 you
 have
 to
 be
 forced
 to
 buy


a
 product
 whether
 you
 like
 it
 or
 not.


You
 can't
 shop
 it
 and
 you're
 fine
 if
 you


don't.
 The
 penalties
 makes
 no
 sense.
 I


said,
 "But
 John,
 if
 the
 Republicans
 have


anything
 they
 can
 give
 us,
 I
 probably


support
 it
 and
 vote
 for
 it.
 They
 don't


have
 anything
 to
 replace
 it
 with."
 And


what
 it
 did
 do,
 it
 helped
 it
 helped
 poor


working
 people
 that
 that
 were
 that
 were


using
 the
 emergency
 room
 and
 were
 using


workers
 compensation
 for
 the
 only


deliveries
 that
 they
 had
 for
 uh
 for


their
 health
 care.
 So,
 and
 then


pre-existing
 condition,
 we
 stopped
 that


from
 being
 eliminated
 from
 the
 process.


So,
 people
 could
 get
 for
 the
 first
 time


any
 type
 of
 care.
 So,
 that
 was
 good,
 but


somebody
 had
 to
 pay
 for
 it.
 So,
 they


switched
 it.
 Once
 you
 got
 above
 the
 150


percentile
 of
 poverty,
 then
 you
 were
 hit


pretty
 hard
 to
 pay
 for
 what
 we're
 giving


away
 on
 this
 end.
 That
 means
 you
 have
 a


broken
 system.
 Sooner
 or
 later,
 you
 got


to
 fix
 the
 system.
 And
 no
 one
 was


willing
 to
 fix
 it.
 They're
 just
 moving


it
 around.
 So
 the
 Democrats
 when
 COVID


hit,
 hot
 dog,
 that's
 our
 time
 to
 shine


now.
 Let's
 go
 ahead.
 And
 man,
 they
 went


to
 400%
 and
 even
 greater,


>> right?


>> Republicans
 are
 saying,
 can't
 we
 just


get
 back,
 which
 is
 a
 normal
 thing.
 Can


you
 get
 back
 to
 precoid?
 Well,
 it's
 hard


to
 take
 something
 back,
 Jason
 and


Shimoth,
 once
 you
 you
 got
 up
 there


because
 now
 what
 you
 can
 do
 is
 say,


"Okay,
 for
 one
 year,
 we're
 going
 to


extend
 this
 for
 one
 year.
 We're
 going
 to


come
 from
 400
 to
 200.
 We're
 going
 to


gradually
 get
 back
 and
 we're
 going
 to


try
 to
 fix
 our
 delivery
 system
 of
 health


care.
 The
 insurance
 companies,
 insurance


companies
 are
 running
 health
 care.
 It's


not
 the
 professional
 doctors,
 the


professional
 healthcare.
 It's
 insurance


telling
 you
 what
 you
 can,
 what
 you


can't,
 what
 you're
 paying
 for,
 chasing


the
 dollars.


>> That
 has
 to
 change,
 but
 someone
 has
 to


be
 willing
 to
 do
 it.
 So,
 that's
 where
 we


are.
 There's
 a
 an
 issue,
 Joe,
 which
 is


that
 they're
 also
 talking
 about
 the


unintended
 consequences
 of
 the
 cost
 we


have
 to
 bear
 for
 folks
 that
 don't
 have
 a


legal
 immigration
 status,
 right?
 That


there's


>> a
 burden
 that
 that
 includes.
 Can
 you


give
 us
 your
 opinion
 on
 and
 you
 can


expand
 immigration
 whatever


>> immigration
 and
 but
 maybe
 you
 can
 start


with
 the
 healthcare
 because
 I
 think


that's
 the
 that's
 the
 wedge
 issue
 that


seems
 to
 be
 slowing
 everybody
 down
 and


maybe
 give
 us
 a


>> Well,
 the
 Democrats
 are
 telling
 you
 that


that
 that
 it's that's
 not
 in
 there
 that


im
 that
 illegal
 immigrants
 who've
 come


to
 this
 country
 are
 not
 getting
 the


benefits
 of
 of
 of
 uh
 the
 citizens
 of
 our


country
 when
 they
 hit
 hard
 times.
 And


people
 will
 say,
 "Well,
 why
 did
 you


write
 this
 this
 this
 in
 in
 your
 uh
 in


your
 um
 declaration
 of
 what
 you
 want


done
 as
 far
 as
 to
 bring
 the,
 you
 know,


to
 bring
 it
 back
 and
 let's
 get
 going


again."
 You
 put
 that
 in
 one
 of
 your


demands.


There's
 some
 reference
 to
 that
 in
 the


demand.
 So,
 it
 kind
 of
 showed
 what
 their


intentions
 were.
 The
 bottom
 line
 is
 is


that
 no,
 there's
 no
 way
 immigrants
 that


come
 here
 illegally
 and
 don't
 have
 a


pathway
 forward
 or
 we've
 been,
 you
 know,


into
 a
 working
 pathway
 forward.
 Uh
 that


should
 ever
 happen.
 You
 should
 never
 be


able
 to
 have
 benefits
 coming
 here.
 That


should
 not
 be
 attraction
 for
 that.
 And


that's
 what
 they're
 saying
 had
 happened.


I
 beg
 the
 Democrats,
 are
 you
 crazy
 about


doing
 asylum
 at
 the
 border?
 We've
 never


done
 that.


>> Mhm.
 We
 had
 a
 2013
 piece
 of
 legislation


by
 bipartisanship
 at
 that
 time.
 It
 was
 a


bipartisan
 gang
 of
 eight
 to
 put
 it


together
 and
 we
 passed
 it
 with
 68
 or
 69


votes
 in
 the
 Senate.
 Senate
 to
 the


House.
 John
 Boehner,
 I
 beg
 John
 Boehner


to
 put
 it
 on
 the
 floor.
 I
 like
 John


Boehner.
 He's
 a
 friend
 of
 mine.
 John


says,
 "Joe,
 I
 can't
 put
 it
 on.
 Eric


Caner
 just
 got
 defeated
 in
 Richmond


because
 a
 person
 from
 the
 far
 right


accused
 Eric
 Caner
 for
 supporting
 this


immigration
 reform."
 and
 they
 said
 it's


amnesty
 and
 by
 God,
 anybody
 that
 came


here
 the
 wrong
 way
 has
 got
 to
 get
 out
 of


here.
 We
 got
 to
 send
 them
 back.
 That


bill
 that
 we
 put
 together
 in
 a


bipartisan
 way
 that
 basically
 gave
 you


so
 many
 days,
 let's
 say
 60,
 90
 days
 or


more,
 I
 forget
 the
 the
 term
 right
 the


amount
 right
 now
 to
 go
 to
 the
 courthouse


and
 turn
 yourself
 in,
 pay
 a
 fine
 for


misdemeanor.
 Let's
 say
 it
 was
 $750.
 And


then
 you
 would
 get
 in
 the
 back
 of
 the


queue.
 Well,
 once
 you
 turned
 yourself


in,
 we
 would
 know
 if
 you
 had
 any


criminal
 record
 or
 not.
 Then
 we
 knew
 how


who
 to
 go
 after
 because
 those
 people


been
 here
 for
 10,
 20,
 30
 years.
 They


brought
 little
 children
 here
 now
 who
 are


adults
 serving
 in
 the
 military
 and


basically
 professing
 teaching
 in
 our


schools.
 These
 are
 productive,


supportive.
 They
 love
 the
 country
 as


much
 if
 not
 more
 than
 Americans
 that


were
 born
 here.
 So,
 this
 is
 what
 gets


me.
 We
 had
 that
 bill
 and
 couldn't
 get
 it


because
 they
 were
 afraid
 that
 he
 would


lose
 the
 right.
 He
 lost
 them
 anyway.
 The


far
 right
 wasn't
 going.
 Tea
 Party
 at


that
 time
 wasn't
 going
 to
 go.
 But
 John


could
 have
 put
 it
 on
 the
 floor
 and
 it


would
 have
 passed.
 And
 I
 think
 if
 you


talk
 to
 John,


>> do
 you
 think
 Americans
 would
 be
 shocked


if
 we
 really
 knew
 the
 inner
 workings
 to


understand
 that
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


bipartisan
 coalitions
 and
 reforms


literally
 stop
 on
 a
 dime
 on
 all
 number


of
 issues
 because
 a
 person
 one
 day


interprets
 and
 reads
 the
 tea
 leaves
 and


says
 yes,
 no,
 yes,
 no.
 Is
 that
 mean
 is


that
 really
 basically
 what
 happens?


>> Well,
 let's
 let's
 look
 at
 here.
 Let
 me


give
 you
 the
 most
 the
 easiest
 thing
 we


could
 have
 done
 with
 uh
 uh
 there's
 two


things.
 Don't
 ask,
 don't
 tell.
 And
 then


you
 have
 uh
 the
 DOBS
 act
 as
 far
 as
 on
 on


uh
 uh


abortion.
 Okay.
 With
 the
 Supreme
 Court.


>> Sure.


>> Well,
 the
 Supreme
 Court,
 you
 know,
 on


that
 we've
 lived
 uh
 with
 Roie
 Wade
 for


50
 years
 of
 unprecedented
 law.
 It
 was


unprecedented
 law.
 I
 mean
 50.
 We
 never


codified
 it
 through
 the
 legislature,
 but


the
 courts
 it
 was
 precedented.
 Now
 all


of a
 sudden
 that
 blows
 apart
 and


everybody
 gets
 torn
 apart.
 All
 they
 had


to
 do
 was
 just
 codify
 Roe
 vie
 Wade.


That's
 all
 we
 had
 to
 do.
 And
 I
 I
 teamed


up
 with
 Lisa
 Marowsky
 and
 and
 Susan


Collins
 and
 we
 had
 a
 bill
 that
 all
 we


did
 simply
 codify.
 It
 wasn't
 it
 wasn't


pro-life
 enough
 and
 it
 wasn't
 pro-choice


enough.
 But
 it's
 something
 we
 learned
 to


navigate
 for
 50
 years.
 Well,
 guess
 what?


Our
 Democrat
 friends
 wanted
 to
 open
 up


wide
 wide
 open
 abortions
 up.
 Okay,
 they


can
 tell
 you
 what
 they
 want,
 what
 they


intended,
 but
 that's
 exactly
 what
 they


were
 trying
 to
 do.
 And
 I
 told
 him,
 I


says,
 I
 called
 him
 out.
 I
 says,
 "Are
 you


going
 to
 try
 to
 explain
 to
 people
 to


make
 them
 believe
 what
 you
 this
 piece
 of


legislation
 you're
 trying
 to
 put
 through


on
 the
 freedom
 of
 choice
 is
 going
 to
 be


uh
 just
 codifying
 Roie
 Wayade?
 That
 is


so
 insincere
 and
 I
 will
 not
 have
 any


part
 of
 it."
 And
 then
 the
 Republicans


want
 to
 just
 double
 down.
 I
 mean,
 make


it
 crim
 criminalizing
 abortions.
 We


couldn't
 because
 of
 politics
 and
 and


I've
 seen
 things
 like
 that
 that
 we
 had


it
 right
 in
 the
 palm
 of
 our
 hand
 and
 let


it
 slip
 through
 and
 we
 could
 have
 done


that
 and
 that's
 on
 the
 we
 could
 have


done
 the
 immigration
 uh
 and
 right
 now


you'd
 never
 be
 in
 this
 immigration
 fact.


A
 lot
 of
 this
 history
 gets
 swept
 under


the
 rug
 because
 nobody
 really
 knows
 what


was
 possible
 because
 people
 like
 you


typically
 don't
 leave
 and
 then
 write
 a


book
 like
 this
 to
 kind
 of
 just
 share
 all


of
 it.
 And
 then
 part
 of
 it
 is
 then
 when


you
 do
 share
 unless
 people
 like
 us
 help


amplify
 these
 stories,
 it's
 never
 said


and
 it's
 never
 it's
 never
 really
 well


understood.


>> The
 biggest
 problem,
 Shimarth,
 is
 this.


Very
 few
 people
 who
 have
 been
 in


political
 life
 and
 had
 any
 notoriety
 at


all
 have
 a
 they
 they
 have
 almost
 an


impossible


time
 of
 saying,
 "I
 got
 it
 wrong.
 I
 made


a
 mistake.


>> I
 tried.
 I
 thought
 I
 had
 the
 answers,


but
 I
 didn't.
 I
 misread
 that
 one."
 You


How
 many
 times
 have
 you
 heard
 anybody
 in


politics
 today
 or
 have
 been
 in
 politics


can
 still
 say
 that
 I
 screwed
 up
 royally


on
 don't
 ask
 don't
 tell?
 And
 I'll
 tell


you
 why.
 I
 was
 there
 my
 first
 2011.
 All


the
 joint
 chiefs
 of
 staff
 were
 there
 and


explaining
 and
 Obama
 wanted
 to
 get
 rid


of
 it.
 Okay?
 Because
 before
 everybody
 uh


kind
 of
 kept
 a
 don't
 ask
 don't
 tell.


That
 was
 a
 Bill
 Clinton
 thing.
 Let's


let's
 let's
 let
 let
 bygones
 be
 bygones.


Let
 let
 the
 sleeping
 dog
 lie.
 Well,
 it


came
 out
 now.
 Obama
 wanted
 to
 get
 rid
 of


it.
 Okay.
 And
 then
 I'm
 listening
 to


everybody
 talk.
 It
 got
 down
 to
 the


comedant
 of
 the
 Marines
 and
 the
 Marine


comedant
 said,
 "Listen,
 General."
 He


says,
 "I've
 got
 50%
 of
 my
 troops
 on
 the


battle
 line
 right
 now.
 This
 is
 a
 heck
 of


a
 policy
 change.
 Could
 jeopardize
 the


welfare
 and
 well-being
 of
 my
 troops."


So,
 I
 was
 against
 it.
 I
 said,
 "Don't
 get


rid
 of
 it."
 No.
 No.
 That
 means
 if
 you


were,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 were
 known
 uh
 to


be
 uh
 gay,
 then
 you
 could
 not
 serve.
 I


was
 totally
 wrong
 on
 that
 because
 it


they
 went
 ahead
 and
 passed
 it.
 Thank


goodness.
 And
 then
 I
 found
 out
 that
 it


didn't
 change
 anything.
 Everybody


already
 knew.
 Everybody
 knew
 who
 was
 who


and
 what
 their
 pre
 sexual
 preferences


were.
 It
 didn't
 affect
 their
 their


ability
 to
 fight
 or
 defend
 our
 country.


So,
 I
 made
 a
 mistake.
 I
 got
 that
 wrong


>> and
 I
 lived
 up
 to
 it.
 And
 I
 said,
 "I


made
 a
 mistake.
 I'm
 sorry,
 but
 I
 thought


I
 was
 doing
 the
 right
 thing
 listening
 to


a
 professional."
 So,
 those
 things


happen.
 But
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 we
 get
 to


that.
 And
 that's
 why
 I
 kept
 saying
 if
 we


had
 two
 six-year
 terms
 for
 a
 senator,


six
 two-year
 terms
 from
 a
 House
 member,


one
 18-year
 term
 for
 the
 United
 States


Supreme
 Court,
 and
 one
 six-year
 term
 for


the
 president,
 maybe
 we
 could
 all
 do
 a


better
 job
 by
 not
 worrying
 about
 the


next
 election.


>> You
 know,
 as
 we
 get
 towards
 the
 end
 of


our
 time,
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 a
 little


bit
 about
 how
 dysfunctional
 and


unpopular


uh
 the
 Democrats
 and
 the
 Republicans


have
 been
 the
 last
 couple
 of
 years
 since


Nixon.
 Uh
 I
 think
 Trump's
 first
 and


second
 term
 both
 uh
 you
 know
 30
 I
 think


he's
 about
 37%
 approval
 rating
 right


now.
 Uh
 Biden
 ended
 with
 like
 34%.
 He


was
 averaging
 about
 40%.
 People
 really


are
 not
 happy
 with
 their
 choices
 and


there's
 a
 no
 labels
 group.
 I've
 been


kind
 of
 mocked
 and
 dismissed
 here
 on


this
 very
 podcast
 talking
 about
 I
 think


there's
 a
 perfect
 time
 for
 a
 third


party.
 And
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 had
 Ross


Perau,
 people
 forget
 he
 got
 19%
 I


believe
 of
 the
 uh
 popular
 vote.
 You
 are


in
 my
 camp.


>> You
 believe
 there's
 a
 possibility
 and


that
 we're
 primed
 for
 it.
 Give
 your
 um


give
 your
 best
 um
 explanation
 of
 why
 you


think
 now
 is
 the
 time
 for
 a
 third
 party


to
 challenge
 these
 two
 extremely


unpopular
 parties.


>> Jason,
 we've
 got
 to
 change
 the
 process


of
 how
 we
 know
 you
 have a
 duopoly
 right


now.
 The
 duopoly
 is
 a
 business
 monopoly


almost,
 but
 it's
 a
 duopoly.
 You
 have
 the


corporation
 of
 the
 Republican
 and
 the


corporation
 of
 the
 Democrat
 and
 that's
 a


business
 mode
 and
 they
 can
 control
 the


flow.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 control
 the
 flow?
 By


the
 primaries
 you
 can
 say
 well
 it's
 by


redistricting
 and
 all
 this.
 It's
 really


the
 primary
 process.
 The
 primary
 process


is
 this.
 I
 cannot
 being
 a
 no
 party


affiliate
 right
 now
 an
 independent


that's
 that's
 my
 registration.
 If
 I
 want


to
 vote
 for
 a
 friend
 of
 mine
 who's
 a


Republican
 in
 West
 Virginia,
 the


Republican
 party
 in
 West
 Virginia
 will


not
 let
 me
 vote
 in
 their
 primary
 unless


I
 register
 Republican.
 The
 Democrats
 do


the
 same
 all
 over
 the
 country.
 They
 do


that.
 they
 close
 them
 down
 cuz
 if
 they


can
 control
 the
 flow
 and
 you
 have
 maybe


during
 a
 uh
 let's
 say
 the
 2024
 election


let's
 say
 24
 million
 people
 maybe
 11
 or


12
 on
 each
 side
 DNR


participated
 in
 the
 p
 national
 primary


but
 160
 million
 of
 us
 voted
 in
 the


general
 election


but
 24
 million
 people
 made
 a
 decision
 on


our
 choices
 that's
 it


>> and
 what
 I've
 said
 this
 is
 our
 democracy


is
 still
 a
 experiment
 we
 thought
 we


could
 govern
 Ourel
 and
 by
 governing


yourself
 that
 means
 we
 can
 pick


representatives
 that
 represent
 us.
 I


can't
 even
 vote.
 So
 how
 am
 I
 I
 can't


participate.


>> 45
 to
 50%
 of
 us
 can't
 participate
 in
 the


primary
 process.
 We're
 the
 largest


nomination
 of
 of
 registered
 voters
 who


can't
 participate.


>> You're
 referring,
 of
 course,


independence.


>> Independence.
 No
 party
 affiliation.


Independence.
 There's
 only
 about
 23
 24%


that
 are
 registered
 Democrats.
 about
 27


28
 I
 think
 registered
 Republicans.
 The


rest
 are
 like
 myself.
 And
 I
 said,


>> "Wait
 a
 minute.
 The
 the the
 Voting


Rights
 Act,
 they
 took
 that,
 you
 know,
 to


the
 court
 uh
 about
 the
 African-Americans


not
 having
 the
 right
 to
 participate
 and


vote
 and
 they
 won
 that
 one.
 Why
 don't
 we


take
 this
 to
 court?
 Why
 don't
 we
 do
 this


on
 this
 podcast?
 You
 all
 take
 off
 with


it
 and
 run
 with
 it.
 It
 should
 be
 we're


not
 I
 am
 not
 able
 to
 be
 represented
 and


I
 can't
 pick
 a
 representative
 cuz
 I


can't
 participate.


>> Let
 me
 just
 summarize
 what
 you're


saying.
 You
 think
 there's
 a
 legal
 avenue


under
 the
 Voting
 Rights
 Act
 that
 says


what
 we
 really
 need
 is
 first
 pass
 the


post
 or
 some
 form
 of
 electoral
 form.


Otherwise,
 if
 you
 just
 do
 it
 via
 these


primaries,
 we're
 getting


disenfranchised.
 My
 position
 is
 this


that
 the
 majority
 of
 people
 who
 are


registered
 to
 participate
 in
 a
 general


election
 in
 the
 United
 States
 of
 America


are
 are
 basically
 prevented
 from


participating
 in
 the
 primary
 process
 of


electing
 who
 you're
 going
 to
 vote
 for
 in


the
 general.
 I
 think
 there
 definitely
 is


a
 court
 procedure
 that
 could
 could


remedy
 this
 and
 basically
 stop
 these


closed
 primaries.


>> Mhm.


>> Let's
 talk
 about
 26
 just
 specifically.


What
 do
 you
 think
 happens
 in
 the
 Senate


and
 the
 House?
 What
 is
 the
 balance
 of


power
 in
 your
 mind
 coming
 out
 of
 the


2016
 election?


>> The
 only
 thing
 I
 have
 I
 have
 said
 and
 I


will
 continue
 to
 say
 this
 because
 my


Republican
 friends
 are
 the
 only
 ones


that
 are
 saying
 we
 will
 not
 get
 rid
 of


the
 filibuster
 in
 the
 United
 States


Senate.


And
 I
 hold
 that
 I
 hold
 them
 to
 their


word.
 These
 are
 my
 friends,
 John
 John


Thun
 and
 his
 and
 his
 staff
 and
 and
 all


of
 his
 people
 on
 his
 leadership
 team.


And
 I
 hope
 the
 Republicans
 keep
 the


Senate.


Now,
 for
 that,
 if
 you
 want
 a
 little
 bit


of
 balance
 of
 power
 to
 change
 challenge


a
 little
 bit,
 calm
 it
 down
 a
 little bit,


then
 you'd
 want
 the
 Democrats
 to
 win
 the


House,
 the
 Congress.


And
 if
 that
 could
 happen,
 then
 it
 might


calm
 it
 down.
 We've
 got
 to
 calm
 it
 down.


We
 got
 to
 we
 got
 to
 turn
 down
 the


temperature.
 And
 if
 that
 would
 turn
 it


down,
 maybe
 fine
 because
 when
 you
 have


the
 trifecta,
 you
 can
 keep
 throwing


stuff
 up
 there
 and
 pushing
 things
 pretty


darn
 hard.
 Joe,
 I
 know
 that
 Jason
 has
 a


final
 question,
 which
 I'll
 let
 him
 do,


but
 I
 want
 to
 I
 want
 to
 give
 you
 my


question.


>> Okay.


>> Let's
 start
 with
 from
 when
 you
 went
 into


the
 Senate
 to
 now
 when
 you're
 leaving.


Yeah.


>> President
 Obama,
 then
 President
 Trump,


then
 President
 Biden,
 and
 now
 President


Trump.


>> Give
 us
 the
 expectation


versus
 the
 outcome


on
 what
 you've
 seen
 from
 these
 four


presidential
 terms,
 if
 you
 will.


expectation
 versus
 outcome
 for
 for
 these


four
 periods.


>> Expectation
 on
 Obama
 was
 was
 that
 he
 was


bringing
 a
 complete
 different
 scenario


to
 it.
 an
 all-inclusive
 scenario
 as
 you


will
 every
 now
 it
 was
 possibility
 for


all
 of
 us
 to
 participate
 no matter
 what


your
 gender
 what
 your
 race
 were
 boom


boom
 boom
 so
 with
 that
 we
 were
 expecting


an
 awful
 lot
 and
 I
 think
 he
 had
 a
 lot
 of


compassion
 but
 he
 just
 it
 just
 didn't


communicate
 well
 with
 the
 legislature
 I


didn't
 know
 that
 because
 I
 didn't
 serve


with
 him
 until
 I
 got
 there
 at
 the
 end
 of


2010
 2011
 and
 I
 could
 see
 you've
 got
 to


participate
 you've
 got
 to
 get
 involved


you
 got
 to
 call
 them
 over
 to
 the
 White


House
 and
 work
 him.
 I
 thought
 he
 could


have
 done
 a
 lot
 more
 with
 that
 to
 get


better
 participation.
 And
 basically,
 we


got
 rid.
 They
 got
 rid
 of the
 filibuster.


We
 lost
 the
 filibuster
 for
 the
 uh
 judges


judicial
 system
 and
 I
 wasn't
 upset
 by


losing
 him
 for
 basically
 appointments


that
 were
 will
 and
 pleasure,
 but
 it
 went


further
 than
 that.
 So,
 that
 I
 think
 that


help
 that
 hap
 helped
 erode
 a
 lot
 of
 the


checks
 and
 balances
 we
 had.
 Then
 it
 went


further
 after
 that,
 too.
 So,
 with
 that


being
 said,
 then
 you
 go
 right
 in
 from


there.
 And
 then
 we
 have
 uh
 Trump.
 We


didn't
 know
 what
 to
 expect,
 but
 we
 were


thinking,
 here's
 a
 businessman


always
 told
 us
 how
 successful
 and
 things


of
 this
 we
 were
 expecting
 some
 things.


And
 I
 I
 met
 with
 him
 from
 day
 one
 and


when
 2016


uh
 and
 talked
 to
 him
 and
 then
 I
 met
 with


him
 2017
 2018
 and
 there's
 a
 cute
 thing


in
 the
 book
 there
 when
 you
 go
 through
 my


book
 about
 he
 said
 he
 wasn't
 going
 to


campaign
 against
 me
 in
 2018.
 He
 liked


me.
 I'm
 his
 friend.
 Well,
 he
 ended
 up


coming
 six
 times
 to
 my
 state
 and
 they


spent
 an
 extra
 25
 million
 trying
 to
 beat


me.
 And
 then
 afterwards,
 he
 calls
 me
 one


week
 later,
 "Come
 have
 lunch
 with
 me."


And
 I
 walk
 in,
 he
 says,
 "I
 told
 you
 we


couldn't
 beat
 him."
 And
 I'm
 thinking,


"Well,
 Jesus,
 what
 the
 hell
 am
 I
 going


to
 say?"
 It
 wasn't
 for
 lack
 of
 trying.


He
 says,
 "Oh,
 Joe,
 you
 know
 I
 didn't


want
 to
 beat
 you."
 I
 says,
 "I
 knew
 you


weren't
 serious,
 Mr.
 President.
 If
 you


were
 serious,
 you'd
 have
 spent
 50


million
 and
 came
 12
 times."


So,
 so
 that's
 what
 I'm
 dealing
 with.
 But


a
 lot
 of
 the
 things
 he
 did,
 I
 was
 more


in
 sync
 with
 what
 he
 was
 doing
 because


he
 understood
 we
 had
 to
 have
 an
 all-in


energy
 policy.


>> Yeah.


>> Well,
 and
 I
 still
 would
 tell
 him,
 I


said,
 "Mr.
 President,
 we
 need


everything.
 We
 need
 oil.
 We
 need
 gas.
 We


need
 coal.
 We
 need
 to
 use
 the


technology."
 I
 said, "You
 cannot


eliminate
 your
 way
 to
 clean
 environment.


You
 can
 innovate
 it,
 but
 you
 can't


eliminate
 it.
 You've
 got
 to
 use


technology."
 Boom.
 So,
 he
 was
 more
 in


tune
 with
 what
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 push


through
 than
 my
 Democrat
 base
 was
 and


the
 people
 I
 was
 working
 with.
 And
 then


we
 have
 Joe
 Biden
 who
 I
 had
 an
 awful
 lot


of,
 oh
 man,
 here's
 a
 guy
 I've
 worked


with
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 And
 in
 Joe
 Biden,


when
 there
 was
 a
 shutdown
 with
 Ted
 Cruz


in
 2013,
 I'll
 never
 forget
 this.
 It
 was


Biden
 uh
 Obama
 sends
 Joe
 Biden
 to
 make
 a


deal.
 Open
 this
 government
 up,
 get
 a


deal
 done.
 Joe
 Biden
 goes
 directly
 to


Mitch
 McConnell,
 sits
 down,
 old
 buddies


and
 old
 friends.
 They
 cut
 a
 deal.
 We


open
 the
 Cong
 We
 open
 the
 government


back
 up.
 And
 I
 went
 into
 caucus
 the
 next


the
 next
 week.
 go
 in
 the
 caucus
 with
 the


Democrats.
 And
 uh
 Harry
 Reid
 says,
 "I


told
 President
 Obama,
 don't
 ever
 send


that
 damn
 Joe
 Biden
 back
 to
 make
 a
 deal.


We
 don't
 want
 him
 here
 at
 all
 making
 a


deal
 for
 Democrats."
 Now
 he's
 the


president.
 Okay.
 Going
 to
 be
 the


president.
 I
 think,
 boy,
 we
 got
 it
 now.


And
 boy,
 was
 that
 a
 let
 down.
 Went
 far


to
 the
 left.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 was


in
 his
 heart.
 But
 he
 came
 out
 of
 Iowa


bad.
 Came
 out
 of
 New
 Hampshire
 even


worse.
 went
 to
 South
 Carolina,
 got


resurrected,
 and
 within
 three
 weeks,


everybody
 dropped
 south.
 Hadn't
 make
 a


deal,
 I
 think,
 with
 the
 wrong
 side
 of


that,
 and
 try
 to
 calm
 it
 down.
 And
 just


for
 the
 sake
 of
 being
 president,
 I
 think


he
 had
 to
 sign
 up,
 and
 his
 people
 took


him
 to
 the
 promised
 land
 of
 the
 far


left,
 which
 has
 no
 return.
 Now,
 with


with
 I
 think
 President
 Trump
 has
 a


chance
 to
 be
 monumental
 in
 what
 he
 can


do
 because
 he
 has
 that
 support
 from
 a


real
 strong
 base.
 I
 want
 to
 see
 the


compassion.
 I
 want
 to
 see
 the
 man
 that


could
 just
 charm
 you
 when
 you
 walk
 in


and
 talk
 to
 him.
 I
 want
 to
 see
 that


being
 shown
 now.
 He
 is
 the
 perfect


president
 for
 the
 Middle
 East.
 Strong


man,
 strong
 arm.
 He
 I
 say
 what
 I
 mean.
 I


mean
 what
 I
 say
 and
 boom,
 boom,
 boom.


Using
 my
 military
 might
 work
 in
 the


western
 part
 of
 the
 world
 where
 we
 have


diplomacy.
 We
 work
 we
 give
 and
 take
 a


little
 bit.
 He's
 a
 good
 enough
 of
 a


negotiator
 to
 understand
 that,
 but


they're
 still
 playing
 his
 people
 are


pushing
 him
 to
 stay
 hard
 hard.
 And
 it's


just
 not
 it's
 not
 what
 we
 need
 right
 now


in
 America.
 We
 need
 a
 leader
 with
 that


compassion,
 but
 the
 ability
 to
 bring
 us


together
 and
 make
 us
 work
 together
 in


the
 United
 States.


>> Last
 question
 before
 I
 give
 it
 to
 Jason


for
 the
 last
 last
 question.
 If
 you
 had


to
 if
 you
 had
 to
 think
 about
 2028


people
 that
 are
 on
 both
 sides
 I
 think
 I


think
 the
 Republicans
 mostly
 the
 dy
 cast


but
 let's
 not
 frontr
 run
 that
 but
 on
 the


Democratic
 side
 maybe
 if
 you
 will
 who


are
 some
 people
 that
 you
 think
 could


bring
 some
 normaly


try
 to
 veer
 that
 party
 back
 to
 more
 of


the
 center
 are
 there
 younger
 emerging


people
 that
 you
 see
 in
 the
 Democratic


caucus
 and
 in
 the
 democratic
 party
 that


you
 think
 has
 this
 potential.


>> I'm
 not
 sure
 it's
 going
 to
 come
 out
 if


we
 have
 anybody
 when
 the
 United
 States


Senate
 on
 the
 Democrat
 side.
 I
 people


that
 are
 capable,
 Mark
 Warner,
 my
 dear


friend,
 I
 know
 he's
 capable
 is
 all
 the


all
 the
 get
 get
 out,
 but
 I'm
 just
 not


sure
 you're
 going
 to
 break
 loose
 because


you
 get
 you
 get
 identified.
 You
 get


labeled.
 You
 know,
 you're
 in
 that


Democrat
 party
 that
 was
 just
 so
 far
 to


the
 left
 and
 this
 and
 that.
 It's
 going


to
 be
 somebody
 coming
 whether
 it's
 going


to
 be
 a
 governor
 or
 an
 upand
 cominging


uh
 statesman
 within
 the
 party
 or
 it


could
 be
 you
 know
 someone's
 talked
 about


Stephen
 A.
 Smith,
 you
 know,
 Stephen.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 mean,
 he
 is
 incredible.
 I'm
 going
 to


tell
 you
 one
 thing.


>> Incredibly
 dynamic.


>> He's
 as
 center
 left,
 center
 right
 as
 you


want.
 He
 can
 go
 both.
 He's
 not
 going
 to


go
 extreme.


>> As
 good
 as
 it
 gets.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


good
 people,
 I
 think,
 could
 rise
 up.


Now,
 will
 the
 Democratic
 party
 accept


him?
 The
 Democrat
 party
 has
 been
 has
 has


been
 basically
 uh
 uh
 taken
 over
 by
 the


extremes.
 Okay?
 And
 they
 say,
 "Well,
 the


MAGA
 party's
 taken
 over
 the
 Republican


party.
 The
 Grand
 Old
 Party
 wants
 to
 be


grand
 again.
 Democrats
 want
 to
 be


responsible
 and
 compassionate.
 Again,
 I


tell
 people
 I'm
 fiscally
 responsible
 and


socially
 compassionate,
 which
 I
 think


most
 Americans
 are.
 But,
 uh,
 and
 then


you
 have
 I
 know
 Steven
 Basher.
 I
 mean,
 I


know
 Andy
 Basher.
 I
 served
 with
 his
 dad.


We
 were
 governors
 together.


>> I
 know
 good
 family.
 I
 know
 those
 people.


So,
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 some
 people
 rise


up
 that
 might
 be
 surprising.
 Shapiro.
 Do


you
 think
 that
 there
 are
 entrepreneurs


like
 Donald
 Trump
 but
 on
 the
 left
 or
 do


you
 think
 that
 that
 avenue
 is
 closed
 for


business
 people
 on
 the
 Democratic
 side?


>> I
 wouldn't
 think
 so
 because
 a
 business


person
 on
 the
 Democratic
 side
 could
 come


across
 with
 a
 heart
 and
 a
 soul
 and
 be
 a


little
 bit
 more
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 softer


in
 their
 approach,
 you
 know,
 and
 I
 think


be
 able
 to
 hit
 a
 nerve
 there.
 We
 have


someone
 with
 the
 smarts
 to
 do
 it
 and
 we


have
 someone
 with
 the
 compassion
 but


also
 the
 strength
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we


remain
 I
 I'm
 concerned
 my
 biggest


concern
 I
 have
 is
 what
 Mike
 Mullen
 told


me
 in
 2011
 my
 first
 armed
 services


meeting
 Shimat
 and
 Jason
 I
 sat
 there
 I
 I


wanted
 they
 asked
 the
 question
 what's


the
 greatest
 fear
 the
 United
 States
 of


America
 has
 right
 today
 and
 that's
 2011


I
 thought
 he's
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 China


about
 North
 Korea
 about
 Iran
 on
 and
 on


and
 on
 he
 never
 missed
 a
 beat
 within
 one


second
 he
 says
 the
 debt
 of
 the
 nation


will
 take
 us
 down.
 We
 will
 fold
 because


the
 debt
 we
 have
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be


unmanaged
 debt
 which
 will
 make
 us
 lead


us
 to
 make
 cowardly
 decisions
 and
 we're


at
 37
 trillion.
 One
 every
 $5
 that
 we


receive
 for
 revenue
 to
 run
 our
 country


takes
 $1
 of
 that
 20%
 just
 to
 pay
 the


debt
 on
 our
 our
 interest
 our
 interest
 on


our
 debt.


>> That's
 horrible.


>> Praise
 him.
 Jamie
 Diamond,
 Bob
 Iger
 come


to
 mind.


>> Absolutely.
 that
 big.
 I
 mean,


>> I
 I
 would
 be
 receptive
 to
 all
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 good
 people.
 I
 think
 it's
 going


to
 be
 very
 interesting.
 The
 Democratic


party
 will
 have
 to
 get
 out
 of
 its
 own


way
 and
 his
 ideology
 left.


>> People
 aren't
 going
 that
 direction.
 Let


me
 give
 you
 one
 other
 thing,
 Jason,
 to


think
 about.


>> Bernie
 and
 and and
 AOC
 is
 going
 around


the
 country
 with
 these
 rallies
 and


rallies.


>> Yeah.


>> If
 that
 was
 effective
 and
 that's
 where


the
 country's
 going,
 why
 has
 the


Democrats
 lost


lost
 basically
 people
 who
 were


registered?
 They've
 lost
 registration
 of


over
 100,000
 people
 who've
 left
 the


Democratic
 party
 since
 they've
 started


that
 crusade.


>> Nobody
 wants
 it.
 It's
 a
 road
 to
 nowhere.


>> No,
 that's
 exactly
 right.


>> Wow.
 Big
 Joe,
 you
 you've
 been
 so
 uh


honest
 and
 candid
 here.
 It's
 okay
 if
 I


call
 you
 Big
 Joe
 because


>> I
 just
 I
 don't
 know.
 I've
 been
 called


Big
 Joe.
 You
 know
 what
 Joe
 Biden
 called


me.
 He
 says,
 "Jojo."
 I
 could
 always
 tell


if
 he
 was
 in
 a
 good
 mood
 with
 me.
 He


said,
 "Hey,
 Jojo,
 what's
 going
 on?"
 And


if
 he
 was
 pissed,
 "Hey,
 Joe,
 what's


wrong?"


>> Oh.
 Oh,
 yeah.
 I'll
 just
 call
 you
 big
 Joe


because
 I
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 respect
 for
 you.


Um,


>> okay.


>> You've
 been
 so
 honest
 today
 and
 so
 uh


you
 can
 be
 permission
 to
 be
 totally


candid
 here.
 How
 close
 did
 you
 come
 to


running
 as
 an
 independent
 for
 president


and
 you
 can
 be
 especially
 candid
 about


this.
 How
 would
 you
 now
 that
 you
 got


this
 great
 book
 and
 a
 great
 track
 record


obviously
 a
 profile
 and
 courage.
 How


would
 you
 make
 the
 decision
 to
 run


yourself
 in
 2020?
 Walk
 us
 through
 both.


I
 think
 about
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 would
 have


loved
 to
 have
 been
 and
 I
 begged
 the


Democratic
 party
 to
 have
 a
 mini
 primary,


30-day
 primary
 when
 Joe
 Biden


>> love
 it.


>> I
 I
 begged
 him.
 I
 said,
 "You
 had
 to
 you


had
 to
 dispel
 some
 of the
 things
 that


they
 were
 labeled
 with."
 And
 not
 every


Democrat
 believed
 in
 that.
 That
 would


have
 been
 a
 time
 to
 dispel
 a
 lot
 of
 that


stuff.
 But
 boy,
 when
 he
 come
 doubled


down
 and
 came
 right
 back
 within
 what,
 an


hour
 or
 two
 and
 threw
 everything
 behind


Kla
 Harris,
 it
 was
 over.
 And
 uh
 you
 know


her
 I
 knew
 we
 were
 in
 trouble
 then.
 Uh
 I


would
 have
 loved
 to
 been
 on
 that
 das.


>> Would
 you
 have
 run
 in
 a
 speedrun?
 Would


you
 have
 put
 yourself
 out
 there
 in
 a


speedrun?


>> I'd
 have
 been
 right
 in
 there.
 I'd
 have


I'd
 done
 everything
 I
 could
 to
 be


talking
 about
 things
 that
 we're
 talking


about
 now.
 Do
 we
 need
 energy?


Absolutely.
 Don't
 turn
 your
 back
 on


energy.
 This
 is
 make
 sure
 we
 do
 it


better
 than
 anybody
 in
 the
 world.
 Uh
 do


you
 need
 do
 you
 need
 a
 strong
 border?


Well,
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 something.
 You
 all


have
 property
 lines.
 When
 you
 buy
 a


piece
 of
 property
 and
 a
 house,
 you


either
 build
 a
 fence
 or
 you
 lived
 in
 a


gated
 area,
 you
 want
 to
 protect
 your


property.
 Why
 can't
 we
 protect
 our


borders,
 but
 also
 have
 an
 legal


immigration
 policy
 that
 works.
 I
 got
 to


brought
 all
 of
 that
 stuff
 out.
 And
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 Democrats
 believe
 like
 I


do,
 but
 they've
 gone
 so
 far
 to
 the
 left


they
 can't
 retreat.


>> And
 if
 they
 don't
 get
 out
 of
 their
 way,


they're
 going
 to
 go
 down
 in
 defeat.


>> And
 so
 2028
 to
 Jason's
 question.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 2028,
 guys.
 I
 mean,
 if
 we'll


have
 to
 see.
 I'll
 do
 anything
 I
 can
 to


help
 my
 country.
 But,
 you
 know,
 I
 want


to
 make
 sure
 2028
 I
 will
 be
 what?
 I'm
 78


years
 old
 right
 now.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 be
 81.
 Same
 as
 Biden,
 close


to
 Trump.
 Yeah.
 And
 you're
 sharp
 as


attack.


>> And
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 year
 younger.
 I'll
 be
 the


I'll
 give
 you
 something.
 Mitt
 Romney
 and


I
 were
 talking
 about
 running.
 I
 said,
 "


Mitt,"
 he
 said,
 "Joe,
 let's
 we
 have
 to


start
 a
 new
 party."
 I
 said, "What
 would


it
 be,
 man?"
 He
 said, "We'll
 call
 it
 the


not
 stupid
 party."


>> I
 said,
 "Hell,
 my
 question
 is
 why
 we're


involved
 then."
 Yeah.
 And


And
 then


>> what
 are
 we
 doing
 here?


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 I
 said,
 "Well,
 man,
 what


do
 you
 think?"
 He
 said, "Joe,
 listen."


He
 said, "They
 don't
 want
 two
 old
 white


guys
 running."
 And
 I
 said,
 "We're
 the


youngest
 ones
 out
 there
 right
 now."


Yeah,
 you're
 whippers
 snappers.


We
 were
 both
 of
 your
 younger.
 We
 have
 a


lot
 of
 fun
 with
 that.
 We
 talked
 a
 lot.


Anyway,
 look,
 we'll
 just
 see
 what


happens.
 I'm
 going
 to
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


involved
 every
 way
 I
 can.
 And
 the
 good


Lord
 gives
 me
 the
 health
 and
 strength
 to


participate.
 Any
 way
 I
 possibly
 can,
 I


will.
 But
 I
 guarantee
 I'll
 be
 trying
 to


find
 the
 right
 people
 that
 put
 country


before
 party
 and
 all
 the
 behind


him
 and
 let's
 get
 this
 country
 back
 on


track.


>> Heck
 yes.


>> Well,
 Joe,
 by
 the
 book,


>> on
 behalf
 of
 the


>> All-In
 community,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 say


thank
 you
 for
 your
 years
 of
 service.
 Buy


the
 book.


>> Yeah,
 center
 in
 defense
 of
 common
 sense.


Don't
 be
 stupid.


>> Your
 daughter
 is
 incredible.
 Heather
 is


the
 best.


>> Heather
 is
 a
 force
 and
 you
 know
 that
 she


thinks
 the
 world
 of
 you
 and
 your
 wife,


your
 family.
 So,
 I'm
 just
 so
 happy
 that


we
 got
 to
 spend
 a
 little
 time
 together


and
 I
 look
 forward
 to
 coming
 out
 and


with
 you
 all
 and
 Jason
 to
 meet
 with


>> you.
 Come
 do
 a
 live
 one.
 Yeah,
 we'll


talk.


>> Let's
 do
 a
 live
 one.
 Oh,
 we'll
 have
 one


hell
 of
 a
 poker
 party.


>> That'll
 be
 That'll
 be
 a
 bar.
 Ladies
 and


gentlemen,
 there's
 your
 hour
 with
 Joe


Mansion.


>> Thank
 you.


>> I'm
 going
 all
 in.
