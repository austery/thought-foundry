hi
 everybody
 tune
 in
 to
 this
 short


version
 of
 the
 podcast
 which
 we
 do
 every


Friday
 for
 the
 long
 version
 tune
 in
 on


Wednesdays
 hi
 everybody
 I'm
 Nikola


tangin
 and
 today
 I'm
 here
 with
 one
 of


the
 most
 incredible
 Tech
 entrepreneurs


Of
 All
 Times
 who
 started
 off
 in
 his


freshman
 dorm
 room
 and
 built
 his
 company


to
 one
 of
 the
 largest
 technology


companies
 in
 the
 world
 now
 onethird
 of


you
 will
 have
 a
 PC
 with
 his
 name
 on


Michael
 D
 welcome
 thank
 you
 so
 much


great
 to
 be
 with
 you
 normally
 Michael
 I


would
 kind
 of
 start
 with
 the
 Press
 but
 I


think
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 you
 we
 have
 to
 go


all
 the
 way
 back
 you
 know
 with
 the


beginning
 you
 were
 very
 young
 and
 you


bought
 an
 IBM
 computer
 and
 most
 people


would
 kind
 of
 start
 to
 do
 computer


things
 but
 you
 took
 it
 apart


instead
 what
 did
 you
 how
 did
 that
 happen


what
 did
 what
 did
 you
 see
 inside
 that


computer
 well
 back
 then
 you
 could


actually
 learn
 a
 lot
 because
 you
 didn't


have


these
 large
 chips
 that
 we
 have
 today


that
 are
 an
 amalgamation
 of
 lots
 of


small
 chips
 yeah
 and
 so
 you
 could


literally
 uh
 get
 a
 book
 that
 would


explain
 what
 each
 chip
 did
 and
 you
 could


understand
 the
 circuits
 and
 as
 I
 said
 I


was
 upgrading
 computers
 to
 make
 them
 do


more
 right
 you
 know
 more
 memory
 more


storage
 uh
 make
 them
 go
 faster
 right
 and


so
 what
 I
 found
 in
 this
 IBM
 personal


computer
 was
 that
 none
 of
 the
 parts
 were


made
 by
 IBM
 and
 then
 I
 sort
 of


discovered
 that
 that
 the
 uh
 cost
 that


they
 were
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 price
 they


were
 charging
 for
 the
 computer
 was


roughly
 six
 times
 the
 cost
 of
 the
 parts


right
 and
 so
 it
 didn't
 really
 seem
 like


it
 was
 fair
 to
 me
 that
 that
 it
 was
 that


expensive
 IBM
 was
 the
 most
 valuable


company
 in
 the
 world
 at
 that
 stage
 and


you
 were
 16
 year
 old
 they
 they
 were
 the


most
 valuable
 company
 in
 the
 world
 and


they
 were
 about
 80%
 of
 the
 value
 of
 the


sector
 you
 know
 called
 technology
 at
 the


time
 so
 they
 were
 more
 dominant
 in
 their


sector
 than
 any
 company
 maybe
 in
 any


time
 in
 history
 I
 mean
 are
 there
 any


companies
 today
 that
 are
 80%
 of
 one


sector
 of
 the
 S&P
 500
 no
 not
 even
 close


so
 yeah
 they
 they
 were
 incredibly


successful


company
 and
 then
 um
 I
 went
 off
 to


college
 I
 was
 uh
 Texas
 University
 of


Texas
 I
 was
 a
 biology
 major
 I
 was


supposed
 to
 be
 a
 doctor
 cuz
 your
 parents


wanted
 you
 to
 study
 Premed
 sort
 of
 the


family
 business
 you
 know
 be
 a


doctor
 and
 U
 strong
 encouragement
 from


the
 parents
 so
 I'm
 not
 in
 in
 my
 parents


house
 anymore
 I'm
 in
 the
 dorm
 room
 I've


got
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 right
 you
 know


University
 of
 Texas
 is
 a
 big
 school
 some


of
 the
 classes
 are
 enormous
 if
 you
 show


up
 or
 you
 don't
 show
 up
 they
 don't


really
 notice
 all
 the
 time
 right
 so
 you


so
 you
 didn't
 know
 show
 up
 so
 I'm
 kind


of
 doing
 this
 computer
 thing
 and
 and


it's
 getting
 bigger
 and


bigger
 and
 um
 my
 parents
 found
 out
 about


they
 got
 very
 upset
 they
 kind
 of
 made
 me


stop
 I
 stopped
 for
 10


days
 and
 uh
 and
 that's
 when
 I
 decided


that
 actually
 this
 was
 something
 more
 so


um
 in
 early
 May
 of


1984
 uh
 I
 the
 company
 was
 incorporated


Del
 computer
 Corporation
 became
 a


corporation
 uh
 and
 it
 was
 about
 a
 week


or
 two
 before
 my
 final
 exams
 of
 my


freshman
 year
 and
 so
 the
 first
 year
 we


had
 $6
 million
 in
 revenue
 and
 uh
 the


second
 year
 was
 about
 33
 million
 and
 we


we
 grew
 about
 80%
 per
 year
 for
 the
 first


eight
 years
 compounded
 why
 do
 you
 think


there
 are
 more
 entrepreneurs
 in
 America


than
 elsewhere
 I
 think
 there's
 something


in
 the
 in
 the
 culture
 that
 you
 know
 is


is
 accepting
 uh
 risk
 even
 embracing
 risk


in
 a
 good
 way
 right
 um
 that
 says
 well


okay
 if
 you
 try
 something
 and
 it
 doesn't


quite
 work
 and
 you
 fail
 it's
 okay
 try


something
 else
 right
 and
 maybe
 that
 that


is
 not
 as
 accepted
 everywhere
 I
 think


there's
 you
 know
 a
 combination
 of


factors
 right
 it's
 this
 risk
 acceptance


It's
 Capital
 that
 will
 invest
 behind


that
 there's
 a
 history
 of
 other


entrepreneurs
 that
 you
 can
 look
 to
 that


I
 look
 to
 and
 others
 look
 to
 and
 said


well
 yeah
 they
 did
 it
 so
 maybe
 I
 could


do
 it
 did
 you
 think
 it
 would
 risk
 it
 at


the
 time
 did
 you
 did
 you
 ever
 have
 fear


no
 no
 so
 if
 you
 have
 nothing
 nothing
 to


lose
 right
 so
 uh
 it
 didn't
 seem
 like
 a


big
 risk
 I
 mean
 the
 risk
 for
 me
 was
 if


it
 didn't
 work
 I
 go
 back
 to


college
 so
 um
 a
 third
 of
 your
 income
 is


from
 commercial
 PCS
 um
 like
 the
 one
 I


have
 on
 at
 my
 desk
 what
 are
 the


important
 Innovations
 taking
 place
 here


now
 they
 look
 a
 bit
 like
 they
 don't


change
 that
 much
 right
 I
 mean
 they
 look


a
 bit
 like
 the
 one
 I
 had
 last
 year
 and


last
 year
 well
 actually
 what
 the
 PC
 does


is
 very
 very
 different
 than
 it
 used
 to


do
 and
 so
 we
 keep
 asking
 it
 to
 do
 more


and
 more
 things
 right
 now
 the
 big
 thing


that's
 that's
 you
 know
 going
 in
 the
 PC


is
 AI
 and
 you
 know
 we
 used
 to
 have
 the


the
 CPU
 right
 then
 we
 had
 the
 GPU
 now
 we


have
 something
 called
 the
 npu
 a
 neural


processing
 unit
 and
 it
 is
 a
 part
 of
 the


processor
 that
 speeds
 up
 the
 AI


activities
 that
 occur
 on
 the
 PC
 to
 an


incredible
 degree
 and
 pretty
 much
 all


the
 software
 that
 you're
 using
 is
 being


Rewritten
 so
 that
 anytime
 there's
 a


prompt
 uh
 or
 some
 you
 know
 user
 uh


interaction
 that
 is
 that
 experience
 is


enhanced
 and
 made
 better
 using
 Ai
 and


most
 of
 that
 AI
 maybe
 85
 90%
 of
 it
 will


run
 locally
 on
 your
 PC
 and
 that's


probably
 the
 biggest
 thing
 that's
 going


on
 in
 addition
 to
 to
 you
 know
 longer


battery
 life
 we
 have
 you
 know
 more
 than


24-hour
 battery
 life
 you
 know
 super


super
 bright
 display
 super
 thin
 super


light
 very
 secure
 you
 know
 all
 the


things
 that
 you'd
 want
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a


new
 machine
 to
 replace
 the
 one
 that's


that's
 several
 years
 old
 there's
 so
 we


will
 continue
 to
 buy
 new
 ones
 basically


yeah
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 in
 the
 in


the


future
 you
 were
 listed
 on
 a
 so
 ex
 change


for
 25
 years
 and
 then
 in
 2013
 you
 took


Del
 private
 to
 get
 off
 the
 stock


exchange
 correct
 why
 why
 did
 you
 do
 that


you
 know
 around


2010
 we


started
 uh
 evolving
 the
 company


in
 uh
 into
 new
 areas
 and
 we
 were
 making


Acquisitions
 and
 we
 were
 building
 uh
 you


know
 cloud
 data
 center
 networking


storage
 capability
 and
 kind
 of
 the
 more


we
 did
 that
 the
 less
 the
 market
 liked
 it


at
 the
 same
 time
 something
 else
 was


going
 on
 you
 had
 the
 the
 smartphone
 and


the
 tablet
 right
 were
 sort
 of
 On
 The


Rise
 and
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 looked
 at


the
 smartphone
 and
 the
 tablet
 they
 said


well
 that
 that's
 the
 new
 thing
 we
 don't


need
 the
 PC
 anymore
 because
 we
 have
 we


have
 these
 other
 things
 and
 Dell
 even


though
 it
 has
 all
 these
 other
 businesses


it's
 kind
 of
 a
 PC
 company
 so
 the
 PC's


dead
 so
 therefore
 Dell's
 dead
 right
 so


so
 the
 stock
 kept
 going
 down
 at
 one


point
 the
 stock
 is
 like
 really
 low
 and


I'm
 thinking
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy
 I


this
 company's
 generating


lots
 of
 free
 cash
 flow
 billions
 of


dollars
 of
 free
 cash
 flow
 every
 year
 it


had
 generated
 $150
 billion
 dollar
 of


cash
 flow
 in
 in
 its
 lifetime
 let's
 just


do
 a
 huge
 buyback
 let's
 buy
 back
 all
 the


shares
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 did
 but
 you


also
 a
 bol
 so
 when
 it
 was
 Private
 you
 a


bolt
 EMC
 very
 big
 deal
 yeah
 we
 so
 so


when
 we
 when
 we
 when
 we
 took
 you
 sp
 like


$67
 billion
 right
 so
 biggest
 technology


acquisition
 correct
 the
 world
 seen
 right


so
 when
 when
 when
 we
 took
 Dell
 private


it
 was
 the
 largest
 take
 private
 ever


technology
 yeah
 and
 then
 a
 private


company
 uh
 bought
 a$7
 billion
 public


company
 and
 took
 it
 private


too
 which
 was
 kind
 of
 fun
 and
 um
 that


significantly
 accelerated
 our


transformation
 now
 we
 kind
 of
 became
 uh


like
 a
 public
 company
 then
 because
 we


had
 a
 tracking
 stock
 associated
 with


emc's
 ownership
 in


VMware
 and
 uh
 and
 then
 ultimately
 we
 we


became
 a
 fully
 public
 company
 again
 at


the
 end
 of
 2018
 so
 it's
 the
 most


profitable
 private
 Equity
 deal
 ever
 I


think
 that's
 what
 I'm
 told
 it
 it's


worked
 it's
 worked
 out
 well
 could
 have


been
 a
 lot
 worse
 but
 it
 worked
 out


well
 what
 is
 the
 corer
 culture
 at
 Dell


how
 would
 you
 describe
 it
 it's
 winning


it's
 it's
 it's
 it's
 delivering
 value
 for


our
 customers
 it


is
 understanding
 their
 requirements
 and


solving
 them
 it
 is
 uh
 a
 results


orientation
 um
 it
 is
 uh
 play
 nice
 but


win
 you
 mentioned
 uh
 fun
 uh
 a
 few
 times


and
 clearly
 you
 are
 more
 fun
 than
 most


SE
 that's
 uh
 that's
 a
 very
 that's
 very


clear
 what
 what
 place
 does
 humor
 play
 in


your
 company
 I
 think
 Yuber
 is
 is
 very


important
 yeah
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 can't
 laugh


joke
 around


uh
 play
 tricks
 on
 people
 you
 know
 you're


doing
 it
 wrong
 right
 so
 you
 you
 have
 you


have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 laugh
 at
 yourself
 and


laugh
 you
 know
 and
 uh
 and
 humor
 is


incredibly
 important
