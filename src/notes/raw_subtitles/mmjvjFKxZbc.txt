From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Thursday,
 October
 9th.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


[Music]


>> Joining
 us
 now
 live
 on
 the
 phone
 is
 the


president
 of
 the
 United
 States,
 Donald


J.
 Trump.
 Mr.
 President,
 u
 wow,


congratulations,
 sir.
 Can
 you


>> Last
 night
 in
 an
 interview
 on
 Fox
 News?


>> Well,
 thank
 you
 very
 much,
 John.
 It's
 a


great
 honor
 to
 be
 involved
 in
 it.


President
 Trump
 said
 that
 Israel
 and


Hamas
 have
 agreed
 to
 the
 first
 phase
 of


a
 peace
 plan.
 A
 breakthrough
 that
 comes


just
 days
 after
 the
 war
 in
 Gaza
 passed


the
 2-year
 mark.


>> The
 whole
 world
 came
 together
 to
 be


honest.
 Uh
 so
 many
 countries
 that
 you


wouldn't
 have
 even
 thought
 of
 and
 they


they
 came
 together.
 The
 world
 has
 come


together
 around
 this
 deal.
 Under
 the


agreement,
 which
 was
 pushed
 by
 Trump
 and


negotiated
 via
 Qatari
 mediators
 in


Egypt,
 Hamas
 will
 release
 all
 of
 the


remaining
 living
 hostages
 as
 soon
 as


this
 weekend.
 They're
 believed
 to
 still


be
 holding
 about
 20
 people.
 In
 exchange,


Israel
 will
 release
 nearly
 2,000


Palestinian
 prisoners
 and
 detainees
 and


will
 pull
 back
 its
 troops
 in
 Gaza
 to
 an


agreed
 upon
 line.
 Israeli
 Prime
 Minister


Benjamin
 Netanyahu
 says
 he'll
 convene


his
 cabinet
 today
 to
 sign
 off
 on
 the


deal.
 But
 some
 of
 the
 most
 contentious


issues
 between
 Israel
 and
 Hamas
 seem
 to


have
 been
 left
 up
 to
 future


negotiations,
 including
 whether
 Israeli


forces
 will
 eventually
 leave
 the


territory
 entirely,
 whether
 Hamas
 will


give
 up
 its
 weapons,
 and
 who
 will
 rule
 a


post-war
 Gaza.
 Still,
 the
 initial


breakthrough
 after
 months
 of
 deadlocked


negotiations
 sparked
 hope
 across
 the


region.
 What
 do
 you
 guys
 have
 to
 say
 to


President
 Trump?


[Music]


>> In
 a
 brief
 phone
 call,
 some
 of
 the


family
 members
 of
 the
 Israeli
 hostages


thanked
 President
 Trump
 personally
 for


his
 involvement
 in
 the
 negotiations.
 And


in
 Gaza,
 where
 more
 than
 67,000
 people


have
 been
 killed
 and
 more
 than
 90%
 of


homes
 have
 been
 destroyed.
 Palestinians


told
 the
 Times
 that
 they
 were
 eagerly


awaiting
 a
 possible
 end
 to
 the
 fighting.


One
 English
 teacher
 there
 said
 he
 was


feeling
 a
 mix
 of
 joy
 and
 sadness
 with


optimism
 that
 the
 war
 might
 soon
 be


over,
 but
 quote,
 "Sorrow
 for
 everything


we've
 lost


[Music]


>> on
 Capitol
 Hill
 yesterday.


>> These
 strikes
 were
 not
 authorized
 by


Congress.
 Congress
 has
 not
 been
 showed


the
 evidence
 of
 who
 exactly
 was
 on
 board


these
 ships.
 Such
 strikes
 are
 not
 legal.


Senate
 Democrats
 tried
 to
 block


President
 Trump
 from
 using
 military


force
 against
 boats
 in
 the
 Caribbean,


but


>> on
 this
 vote,
 the
 yays
 are
 48,
 the


naysay
 are
 51,
 and
 the
 motion
 is
 not


agreed
 to.


>> Their
 effort
 failed
 as
 nearly
 all


Republican
 senators
 voted
 against
 the


measure.
 Since
 early
 September,
 the


Trump
 administration
 says
 it's
 blown
 up


four
 boats
 and
 killed
 over
 20
 people
 who


it
 claims
 were
 smuggling
 drugs
 into
 the


US
 from
 Venezuela.
 Trump
 recently
 said


he
 determined
 that
 the
 US
 is
 in
 a
 formal


armed
 conflict
 with
 drug
 cartels.
 But


the
 strikes
 on
 boats
 have
 largely
 been


seen
 by
 experts
 in
 military
 law
 as


illegal
 and
 the
 attacks
 have
 drawn


intense
 criticism
 from
 Democratic


lawmakers
 who
 said
 that
 the
 White
 House


has
 offered
 no
 credible
 evidence
 that


would
 justify
 the
 strikes.
 Meanwhile,


the
 president
 of
 Colombia
 yesterday
 said


one
 of
 the
 boats
 the
 US
 bombed
 was
 from


his
 country,
 not
 Venezuela.
 He
 said


Colombian
 citizens
 had
 been
 killed.
 Two


American
 officials
 also
 told
 the
 Times


that
 Colombians
 were
 on
 board
 at
 least


one
 of
 the
 boats
 the
 US
 destroyed.
 The


White
 House
 dismissed
 the
 Colombian


president's
 comments
 as
 quote
 baseless


and
 reprehensible.


Today,
 federal
 judges
 will
 hear


arguments
 in
 two
 separate
 legal
 cases


over
 President
 Trump's
 plans
 to
 deploy


troops
 in
 US
 cities.
 First
 up,
 Portland.


Trump
 has
 tried
 to
 send
 in
 National


Guardsmen,
 saying
 the
 city
 is
 burning
 to


the
 ground.
 A
 federal
 judge
 blocked
 that


effort
 over
 the
 weekend,
 calling
 Trump's


assessment,
 quote,
 simply
 untethered
 to


the
 facts.
 But
 the
 government
 appealed


and
 now
 a
 panel
 of
 judges
 will
 hear
 more


arguments
 today.
 The
 president's


assessment
 of
 Portland
 is
 at
 odds
 with


descriptions
 from
 federal
 officers
 on


the
 ground
 there.
 On
 the
 same
 day,
 Trump


called
 the
 city
 under
 siege
 from
 mobs


protesting
 ICE.
 Officers
 at
 an
 ICE


facility
 described
 the
 protests
 as
 low


energy
 in
 internal
 reports
 seen
 by
 the


Times.
 Local
 officials
 said
 this
 week


though
 that
 the
 small
 demonstrations


have
 grown
 more
 intense
 since
 the


president
 posted
 about
 Portland
 on


social
 media.


And
 in
 Illinois,
 a
 federal
 judge
 will


hear
 arguments
 about
 whether
 to
 stop
 the


deployments
 of
 National
 Guard
 troops


there
 after
 several
 hundred
 were
 sent
 to


the
 state
 from
 Texas
 this
 week.
 The


Trump
 administration
 has
 said
 the
 troops


are
 necessary
 for
 safety,
 citing
 crime


rates
 and
 rising
 tensions
 around


immigration
 enforcement
 operations.
 But


state
 officials
 have
 objected
 and


Governor
 JB
 Pritsker
 described
 it
 as
 an


invasion.
 Yesterday,
 Trump
 doubled
 down,


claiming
 Pritsker,
 who
 is
 a
 Democrat,


should
 be
 in
 jail
 for
 what
 Trump


described
 as
 failing
 to
 protect
 ICE


officers.


>> Out.
 He
 said
 he
 was
 going
 to
 jail
 Gavin


Newsome.
 He
 says
 he's
 going
 to
 jail
 me.


He
 says
 he's
 going
 to
 jail
 the
 mayor
 of


the
 city
 of
 Chicago.


>> Pritsker
 dismissed
 Trump's
 threat.


>> Come
 and
 get
 me.
 Come
 and
 get
 me.
 This


week,
 the
 governor
 claimed
 Trump's


ultimate
 goal
 is
 to
 normalize
 military


patrols
 in
 American
 cities,
 potentially


to
 even
 intimidate
 voters
 in
 future


elections,
 saying,
 quote,
 "He
 wants
 us


all
 in
 big
 cities
 to
 get
 used
 to
 the


idea
 that
 it's
 okay
 to
 have
 military
 on


the
 streets.
 You're
 going
 to
 see


soldiers
 outside
 your
 polling
 place.


That's
 going
 to
 intimidate
 a
 lot
 of


people."


After
 more
 than
 eight
 months
 of


tireless,
 meticulous
 work,
 I
 stand
 here


with
 our
 partners,
 proud
 to
 announce
 an


arrest
 in
 connection
 to
 the
 devastating


Palisade
 fires
 that
 claimed
 lives,


destroyed
 homes,
 and
 shook
 this


community
 to
 its
 core.


>> In
 Los
 Angeles
 yesterday,
 officials


announced
 they've
 arrested
 a
 29year-old


man,
 saying
 he
 was
 responsible
 for
 the


wildfire
 in
 January
 that
 killed
 12


people
 and
 burned
 thousands
 of


buildings.
 Geoloccation
 data
 showed
 that


he
 was
 standing
 above
 the
 fire
 in
 a


clearing
 merely
 30
 feet
 from
 the
 blaze


as
 it
 rapidly
 grew.


>> The
 authorities
 said
 that
 about
 a
 week


before
 the
 Palisades
 blaze,
 the
 man
 who


was
 an
 Uber
 driver
 and
 former
 resident


of
 the
 neighborhood
 intentionally
 set
 a


small
 fire
 on
 a
 hiking
 trail
 nearby.


Within
 hours,
 that
 fire
 was


extinguished,
 but
 smoldering
 embers
 were


left
 over
 that
 eventually
 roared
 back
 to


life.
 Officials
 said
 that
 the
 suspect


appeared
 to
 have
 been
 obsessed
 with
 fire


and
 that
 before
 lighting
 it,
 he
 was


listening
 to
 a
 song
 on
 YouTube
 featuring


a
 character
 setting
 things
 on
 fire.


Hours
 after
 his
 arrest
 was
 announced,


the
 LA
 Fire
 Department
 released
 an


internal
 review,
 calling
 the
 blaze
 a


perfect
 storm,
 fueled
 by
 dry
 conditions


and
 hurricane
 force
 winds,
 and
 made


worse
 by
 staffing
 shortages.
 Many


survivors
 of
 the
 fire
 have
 since
 sued,


saying
 that
 emergency
 responders
 were


negligent
 and
 hadn't
 properly
 prepared


for
 the
 extreme
 conditions.
 One


Palisades
 resident
 who
 lost
 his
 home


told
 the
 Times,
 quote,
 "I'm
 angry
 that


an
 individual
 would
 be
 so
 depraved.
 It


doesn't
 take
 away
 my
 sense
 of


frustration
 and
 anger
 with
 government.


[Music]


>> And
 finally,


>> I
 wanted
 to
 say
 I
 know
 lately
 uh


everybody
 thinks
 that
 I
 am
 sicker
 than
 I


am.
 Do
 I
 look
 sick
 to
 you?
 I'm
 working


hard
 here.


>> Dolly
 Parton
 wants
 to
 let
 people
 know


she's
 not
 dead
 yet.
 Fans
 of
 the


79-year-old
 country
 legend
 have
 been
 in


a
 frenzy
 since
 Parton
 postponed
 her
 Las


Vegas
 residency
 last
 month,
 citing


medical
 issues.
 Add
 in
 some
 AI
 created


videos
 that
 made
 the
 rounds
 on
 social


media
 and
 rumors
 about
 her
 health
 have


been
 running
 rampant.
 Things
 hit
 a
 whole


new
 level
 this
 week
 when
 her
 younger


sister
 asked
 people
 to
 pray
 for
 Dolly.


>> But
 I
 figured
 if
 you
 heard
 it
 from
 me,


you'd
 know
 that
 I
 was
 okay.
 Parton


released
 a
 video
 to
 reassure
 her
 fans,


saying
 she's
 still
 working
 hard.
 A


little
 reminder
 of
 how
 hard
 can
 work.


She
 is
 credited
 with
 writing
 the
 hits


Jolene
 and
 I
 Will
 Always
 Love
 You
 on
 the


same
 day.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines
 today
 on
 the


daily.
 The
 Supreme
 Court
 is
 kicking
 off


its
 term
 this
 week
 with
 a
 case
 about


conversion
 therapy
 and
 the
 question
 of


whether
 mental
 health
 professionals
 are


legally
 allowed
 to
 try
 and
 change
 a


child's
 sexual
 orientation
 or
 gender


identity.
 You
 can
 listen
 to
 that
 in
 the


New
 York
 Times
 app
 or
 wherever
 you
 get


your
 podcasts.

 Mumford.
 We'll


be
 back
 tomorrow
 with
 the
 latest
 and
 the


Friday
 news
 quiz.
