hi
 everybody
 I'm
 niola
 tangan
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 wealth
 fund
 and


today
 I'm
 here
 with
 John
 Gray
 now
 John


Gray
 Co
 Blackstone
 previously
 the
 head


of
 real
 estate
 hair
 and
 Incredibly
 under


his
 leadership
 blackstone's
 real
 estate


division
 has
 become
 the
 biggest
 in
 the


world
 you
 grew
 it
 from
 some
 5
 billion
 to


more
 than
 300
 billion
 and
 you
 are
 known


for
 some
 of
 the
 best
 deals
 in
 real


estate
 the
 world
 has
 ever
 seen
 such
 as


the
 Hilton
 hotel
 which
 you
 took
 off


market
 and
 I'm
 back
 on
 the
 market
 and


and
 uh
 wow
 well
 done
 great
 to
 be
 here


with
 you
 Nikolai
 and
 you're
 taking
 off


the
 tie
 today
 I
 took
 off
 the
 tie
 because


I
 watched
 your
 stuff
 and
 I
 didn't
 want


to
 be
 overdressed
 that's
 great
 now
 in


short
 why
 has
 Blackstone
 been
 successful


I
 think
 we've
 been
 successful
 uh
 for
 a


couple
 of
 reasons
 the
 main
 one
 is
 we've


never
 forgotten
 what
 our
 mission
 is


which
 is
 delivering
 for
 our
 customers


and
 that
 means
 delivering
 premium


returns
 if
 you
 invest
 in
 private
 markets


instead
 of
 liquid
 markets
 we
 have
 to


deliver
 a
 premium
 and
 because
 we
 focus


intensely
 on
 that
 across
 all
 our


different
 business
 units
 doesn't
 mean


we've
 always
 gotten
 it
 right
 but
 that


focus
 on
 returns
 has
 been
 so
 important


to
 our
 success
 over
 time
 and
 how
 much


money
 do
 you
 need
 to
 make
 for
 your


clients
 for
 them
 to
 be
 happy
 it
 depends


on
 the
 risk
 return
 strategy
 so
 if
 you're


in
 things
 like
 private
 Equity
 or
 real


estate
 private
 Equity
 then
 you
 need
 to


produce
 meaningful
 premiums
 because


you're
 taking
 on
 larger
 risk
 the
 the


capital's
 tied
 up
 for
 a
 long
 period
 of


time
 you
 might
 have
 to
 you
 want
 to


produce
 500
 basis
 points
 of
 excess


return
 let's
 say
 but
 if
 you're
 talking


about
 investment
 grade
 private
 credit


then
 maybe
 it's
 150
 or
 200
 basis
 points


but
 you
 definitely
 have
 to
 produce
 a


premium
 the
 other
 thing
 I'd
 say
 which


means
 that
 instead
 of
 putting
 money
 in


the
 bank
 at
 3%
 you
 need
 to
 deliver
 5%


yes
 that's
 what
 you
 need
 to
 do
 and
 for


higher
 returning
 equities
 instead
 of


producing
 10
 maybe
 you
 need
 to
 produce


15
 net
 to
 the
 customers
 the
 other
 thing


I'd
 say
 to
 Our
 Success
 this
 is
 really
 a


credit
 to
 Steve
 schwarzman
 who
 you
 know


it's
 been
 the
 push
 to
 be
 entrepreneurial


and
 find
 new
 geographies
 to
 invest
 new


products
 to
 deliver
 to
 customers
 new


customers
 it's
 a
 constant
 sort
 of
 energy


restlessness
 in
 this
 place
 that
 we
 can


do
 more
 we
 can
 serve
 our
 customers


better
 and
 the
 combination
 of
 delivering


great
 returns
 and
 this
 sort
 of
 dynamism


That's
 What's
 led
 to
 this
 place
 today


that
 has
 over
 a
 trillion
 one
 of
 capital


and
 north
 of
 a
 $200
 billion
 market
 cap
 I


joined
 a
 firm
 33
 years
 ago
 that
 managed


less
 than
 a
 billion
 dollars
 here
 so
 it's


been
 a
 dramatic
 difference
 but
 again


we've
 never
 lost
 sight
 of
 what's


mattered
 and
 I
 would
 add
 to
 that
 of


course
 the
 people
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 know
 it


in
 the
 investment
 business
 it's
 who


you've
 got
 in
 the
 building
 that
 makes


all
 the
 difference
 you
 said
 that
 you


needed
 to
 be
 entrepreneurial
 I
 think


Steph
 said
 that
 uh
 you
 can't
 teach


entrepreneurialism
 so
 would
 you
 hire


people
 who
 entrepreneurs
 then
 you
 know
 I


would
 say
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of


both
 I
 don't
 think
 think
 you
 can
 really


teach
 people
 who
 are
 extreme


entrepreneurs
 somebody
 like
 Steve
 where


it's
 sort
 of
 born
 into
 his
 DNA
 but
 if


you
 bring
 people
 into
 a
 culture
 and
 you


encourage
 this
 yeah
 and
 you
 say
 to
 them


hey
 get
 on
 that
 plane
 find
 that
 new


customer
 think
 about
 a
 new
 way
 of


investing
 capital
 a
 new
 market
 then
 it


sort
 of
 breeds
 this
 it's
 encouraged
 and


that's
 what
 I
 feel
 like's
 in
 the
 water


here
 there's
 a
 desire
 to
 not
 only


succeed
 at
 what
 we're
 doing
 but
 thinking


about
 how
 we
 can
 expand
 it
 and
 that
 as


we
 EXP
 anded
 it
 brings
 more
 benefit
 to


the
 original
 business
 we
 started
 with
 I


think
 you've
 said
 that
 um
 um
 Cycles
 are


inevitable
 uh
 but
 you
 want
 to
 find
 the


gray
 companies
 and
 and
 own
 them
 for
 the


long
 term
 so
 in
 your
 mind
 what's
 a
 good


business
 what
 what
 are
 the


characteristics
 characteristics
 of
 a


good
 business
 um
 it's
 in
 a
 large
 Market


that's
 growing
 as
 opposed
 to
 the
 little


nichy
 market
 it's
 a
 business
 that
 has


some
 mode
 around
 it
 either
 a
 physical


moat
 or
 something
 that
 makes
 it
 special


a
 brand
 and
 as
 a
 result
 you
 have
 higher


margin
 generally
 higher
 margin


businesses
 say
 something
 about
 a
 company


it's
 a
 business
 generally
 with
 less


Capital


intensity
 sometimes
 there
 are
 highly


Capital
 intense
 businesses
 that
 are


great
 but
 you
 love
 businesses
 that
 are


capital
 light
 you
 love
 businesses
 that


have
 recurring
 revenues
 as
 opposed
 to


having
 to
 start
 over
 every
 year
 they're


not
 exposed
 to
 one
 client
 or
 the


government
 stroke
 of
 a
 PR
 pen
 risk
 um


and
 there's
 a
 potential
 to
 do
 things


adjacent
 to
 the
 business
 and
 I
 so
 tell


me
 give
 me
 one
 example
 what's
 the
 best


buiness
 you've
 seen
 well
 I've
 been
 the


chairman
 of
 Hilton
 Hotels
 you
 brought
 it


up
 at
 the
 beginning
 uh
 for
 17
 years
 and


it's
 Global
 Travel
 is
 an
 enormous
 growth


business
 but
 it's
 capital
 in
 sensive


it's
 not
 the
 way
 they
 do
 it
 so
 the
 way


the
 business
 used
 to
 be
 they
 used
 to
 own


the
 hotels
 and
 lease
 it
 today
 what
 a


company
 like
 Hilton
 is
 is
 a
 management


company
 and
 a
 franchise
 or
 so
 the


physical
 real
 estate
 is
 owned
 by
 Third


parties


investors
 and
 they
 just
 get
 paid
 as
 a


percentage
 of
 revenues
 maybe
 a


percentage
 of
 the
 bottom
 line
 and
 that


allows
 them
 to
 grow
 without
 a
 lot
 of


capital
 Blackstone
 similarly
 and
 of


course
 the
 power
 of
 the
 brand
 there's
 a


network
 effect
 once
 you
 become
 a


frequent
 traveler
 with
 Hilton
 you're


going
 to
 stay
 at
 a
 Double
 Tree
 or
 a


waldorf
 or
 a
 Hampton
 in
 around
 the
 world


and
 then
 other
 owners
 of
 hotels
 are


going
 to
 build
 and
 want
 to
 affiliate


with
 the
 system
 and
 I'd
 say
 similarly


with
 Blackstone
 it's
 a
 capital
 business


it's
 based
 on
 brand
 and
 it's
 able
 to


grow
 into
 a
 very
 fast
 growing


Alternatives
 private
 Capital
 Market
 so
 I


like
 businesses
 that
 don't
 use
 a
 lot
 of


capital
 and
 have
 a
 really
 great
 brand


and
 of
 course
 deliver
 to
 their
 customer


in
 the
 case
 of
 Hilton
 or
 in
 the
 case
 of


Blackstone
 that's
 core
 to
 what
 you
 do
 I


suspect
 if
 you've
 been
 on
 a
 board
 there


for
 17
 years
 you
 spent
 a
 fair
 amount
 of


time
 in
 Hilton
 Hotels
 I
 do
 that
 is


absolutely
 true
 but
 the
 credit
 there


goes
 with
 CEO
 Chris
 Netta
 yeah
 now
 how


has
 the
 investment
 philosophy
 changed


over
 time
 for


Blackstone
 or
 it
 the
 same
 kind
 of
 things


you
 look
 for
 well
 I
 would
 say
 this
 the


rigor
 of
 the
 process
 has
 stayed
 so
 when


I
 joined
 this
 place
 way
 back
 when
 we
 had


you
 know
 pre-investment
 committees
 and


and
 sometimes
 heads
 up
 memos
 and


rigorous
 debates
 in
 the
 investment


committee
 that
 has
 stayed
 and
 that
 in


some
 ways
 has
 gotten
 even
 more
 folsome


over
 time
 and
 it's
 gotten
 better
 because


we're
 not
 just
 doing
 one
 or
 two
 things


we
 get
 this
 big
 much
 broader
 lens
 so
 I


would
 say
 the
 process
 is
 saved
 what
 has


probably
 changed
 is
 at
 the
 beginning
 we


were
 probably
 more
 classic
 value


investors
 you
 could
 sort
 of
 invest
 in


anything
 project
 out
 a
 series
 of
 cash


flows
 and
 you
 know
 value
 this
 and
 I


think
 where
 we've
 moved
 is
 more
 to
 being


a
 little
 more
 High
 conviction
 what
 are


the
 areas
 of
 the
 world
 that
 we
 believe


are
 going
 to
 get
 better
 what's
 a
 good


neighborhood
 you
 know
 phys
 physical


goods
 are
 moving
 from
 retail
 the
 way
 we


traditionally
 think
 about
 it
 to
 online


so
 let's
 really
 lean
 into
 Global


Logistics
 where
 we
 become
 the
 largest


investor
 in
 the
 world
 what's
 happening


in
 Ai
 and
 Cloud
 migration
 is
 leading
 to


enormous
 demand
 for
 data
 centers
 and
 so


let's
 lean
 in
 there
 let's
 lean
 into
 the


power
 that's
 going
 to
 support
 that
 it's


the
 same
 thing
 in
 life
 sciences
 what


we're
 seeing
 there
 with
 genomics
 and
 Ai


and
 Big
 Data
 precision
 medicine
 and
 so


let's
 own
 the
 buildings
 let's
 own
 the


companies
 that
 run
 trials
 let's
 run


let's
 invest
 in
 the
 phase
 three
 drugs


themselves
 and
 so
 I'd
 say
 the
 the
 basic


rigor
 the
 focus
 on
 doing
 tons
 of
 due


diligence
 we
 just
 had
 one
 this
 morning


on
 a
 large
 public
 company
 we're
 looking


at
 buying
 in
 private
 equity
 and
 the


debate
 sounds
 remarkably
 similar
 we
 have


more
 tools
 at
 our
 disposal
 more
 people


who
 can
 add
 value
 but
 I'd
 say
 what
 we


become
 more
 aware
 of
 is
 trying
 to
 buy


better
 businesses
 in
 better
 places
 I'd


love
 to
 drill
 down
 on
 the
 investment


committees
 which
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 which
 I


suspect
 you
 do
 a
 bit
 differently
 than


other
 people
 so
 for
 instance
 how
 many


investment
 committees
 do
 you
 sit
 on
 a


lot
 like
 how
 many
 uh
 double
 digit
 number


of
 investment
 committees
 but
 I'm
 I
 sit


across
 pretty
 much
 all
 the
 firm's


investment
 committees
 I
 spend
 my


weekends
 most
 people
 do
 other
 things
 I


spend
 my
 weekends
 reading
 investment


committee
 memos
 that's
 what
 I
 do
 so
 you


are
 let's
 say
 you
 are
 on
 what
 are
 you
 15


15
 committees
 10
 12
 10
 12
 committees


okay
 12
 committees
 and
 how
 often
 do
 they


meet
 most
 of
 them
 not
 all
 of
 them
 meet


weekly
 at
 least
 every
 two
 weeks
 so
 it's


a
 if
 you
 looked
 at
 my
 calendar
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 time
 spent
 on
 those
 and
 even


sometimes
 when
 I'm
 traveling
 I
 can't


join
 I
 will
 read
 the
 memos
 I'll
 send
 in


my
 comments
 if
 I
 have
 a
 very
 strong
 view


or
 send
 my
 question
 so
 um
 it's
 a
 if
 you


said
 what
 do
 I
 probably
 spend
 the
 most


time
 on
 during
 the
 week
 particularly
 the


weekends
 is
 just
 reading
 these
 memos
 and


it
 can
 range
 from
 a
 Japanese


pharmaceutical
 company
 to
 a
 European


Energy
 company
 how
 long
 are
 these
 memos


we
 try
 to
 limit
 them
 we're
 getting


better
 at
 trying
 to
 keep
 them
 shorter
 we


try
 to
 keep
 the
 text
 up
 front
 to
 sort
 of


three
 pages
 or
 less
 and
 then
 try
 to
 keep


the
 overall
 memo
 less
 than
 20
 Pages
 it


can
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 graphs
 and
 charts
 I'd


say
 we've
 come
 to
 realize
 more
 and
 more


in
 the
 investment
 committee
 process
 that


that
 it's
 less
 about
 page
 58
 in
 the


footnote
 and
 more
 about
 those
 first


couple
 paragraphs
 yeah
 that
 neighborhood


we're
 investing
 in
 the
 quality
 of
 the


underlying
 business
 and
 then
 what
 are


the
 big
 factors
 around
 technological


disintermediation
 risks
 on
 labor
 costs


risks
 on
 government
 regulation
 in
 some


ways
 forcing
 people
 to
 really
 focus
 on


the
 big
 stuff
 yeah
 yeah
 so
 now
 you're


are
 you
 coming
 to
 an
 investment
 meeting


yes
 how
 many
 Investments
 are
 you


discussing
 discussing
 depends
 on
 the


group
 in
 credit
 it'll
 be
 a
 higher
 volume


because
 you're
 doing
 more
 volume
 so


those
 you
 might
 do
 three
 or
 four
 for


private
 Equity
 or
 real
 estate
 private


Equity
 those
 might
 be
 one
 maybe
 two
 but


it
 tends
 to
 be
 a
 smaller
 number
 um
 and


and
 the
 good
 news
 is
 remember
 in
 our


investment
 committee
 there
 are
 the


partners
 generally
 who
 are
 working
 on


the
 transaction
 they're
 the
 senior


Partners
 in
 that
 group
 and
 then
 a


handful
 of
 us
 and
 it's
 not
 always
 the


same
 people
 who
 are
 sitting
 across
 these


we
 have
 a
 coci
 function
 we
 have
 some


cios
 within
 business
 units
 so
 we're


trying
 to
 get
 the
 best
 of
 all
 worlds
 so


how
 many
 people
 would
 you
 be
 in
 the
 room


oh
 it
 depends
 on
 the
 group
 it
 could


range
 from
 10
 to
 25
 people
 often
 times


we
 want
 the
 deal
 teams
 to
 speak
 up
 we


we'll
 go
 around
 in
 many
 of
 these


committees
 and
 ask
 the
 most
 Junior


people
 in
 the
 room
 hey
 what
 do
 you
 think


because
 we
 want
 them
 to
 articulate
 why


they
 have
 conviction
 so
 now
 I'm
 I'm
 25


right
 spright
 out
 of
 business
 school
 you


know
 very
 lucky
 being
 hired
 by
 you
 and


I'm
 presenting
 my
 investment
 case
 to
 you


know
 the
 Big
 John
 Gray
 so
 I'm
 pretty


nervous
 right
 it's
 scary
 scary
 I've
 been


working
 for
 three
 months
 gee
 have
 I
 done


spreadsheets
 yeah
 and
 so
 I
 come
 here
 and


then
 do
 I
 start
 the
 meeting
 and
 tell
 you


why
 you
 should
 buite
 well
 does
 it
 work


yeah
 the
 way
 it
 would
 work
 is
 we're
 not


the
 most
 patient
 group
 of
 people
 so


often
 times
 maybe
 the
 young
 person
 will


start
 it's
 probably
 the
 the
 youngest


person
 may
 not
 be
 the
 one
 talking
 it
 may


the
 principal
 somebody
 let's
 say
 early


30s
 but
 the
 young
 people
 will
 be
 sitting


there
 next
 to
 him
 and
 often
 they'll


start
 talking
 but
 the
 way
 it
 tends
 to


work
 is
 the
 memo
 will
 have
 come


out
 and
 there'll
 be
 a
 series
 of


questions
 people
 are
 really
 Drilling
 in


on
 you
 know
 this
 company
 it
 looks
 good


overall
 but
 it's
 you
 know
 it's
 been


helped
 by
 an
 acquisition
 and
 what
 we're


seeing
 is
 the
 capital
 intensity
 the


working
 capital
 and
 the
 capex
 are
 going


up
 and
 so
 there've
 been
 a
 flurry
 of


questions
 and
 so
 often
 times
 because


people
 will
 have
 read
 the
 materials


they'll
 immediately
 go
 to
 the
 heart
 of


the
 issue
 so
 hopefully
 people
 and
 what


we
 we
 try
 to
 do
 is
 make
 sure
 a
 lot
 of


please
 and
 thank
 yous
 and
 be


appreciative
 to
 the
 group
 but
 there's
 a


really
 sort
 of
 a
 truth-telling
 exercise


we
 also
 have
 you
 know
 we
 have
 the
 teams


do
 business
 quality
 scorecards
 on
 each


of
 the
 things
 we're
 investing
 in
 and


sometimes
 we
 may
 push
 back
 and
 say
 you


gave
 that
 a
 green
 that
 really
 feels
 like


a
 yellow
 or
 red
 but
 scorecard
 is
 like
 a


tick
 list
 so
 as
 if
 you
 were
 a
 pilot
 and


take
 off
 a
 plane
 and
 you
 have
 to


remember
 to
 turn
 on
 the
 fuel
 and
 that


kind
 of
 stuff
 I'd
 say
 it's
 a
 little
 more


of
 the
 margin
 the
 capital
 intensity
 the


quality
 of
 management
 um
 what
 are
 the


weak
 weaknesses
 and
 the
 investment


committee's
 job
 is
 generally
 to
 find
 you


know
 what
 is
 not
 right
 about
 this
 or


what
 should
 we
 be
 concerned
 about
 is
 the


structure
 wrong
 is
 the
 alignment
 wrong


is
 there
 something
 wrong
 with
 the


business
 or
 you
 could
 come
 in
 and
 say


hey
 I
 think
 we're
 being
 too
 conservative


this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 more
 competitive


auction
 are
 we
 leaning
 in
 enough
 and


what
 I
 love
 about
 our
 firm
 is
 there's
 a


really
 healthy
 balance
 between
 sort
 of


the
 entrepreneurial
 Spirit
 of
 the
 people


identifying
 opportunities
 and
 sectors


and
 the
 control
 mechanism
 of
 the


investment
 process
 so
 what
 percent
 of


the
 cases
 you
 bring
 up
 actually
 go


through
 to
 positive
 decision
 the
 way
 I


think
 about
 it
 is
 it's
 an
 evolution
 as


opposed
 to
 you
 know
 once
 every
 couple


months
 a
 deal
 comes
 up
 and
 then
 you're


like
 this
 typically
 within
 the
 business


unit
 the
 people
 who
 are
 the
 leaders
 of


those
 businesses
 will
 get
 these
 early
 on


or
 the
 heads
 of
 Acquisitions
 they'll
 do


screening
 and
 they'll
 kick
 out
 a
 bunch


of
 stuff
 and
 they
 may
 make
 modifications


and
 say
 look
 we're
 not
 willing
 to
 do


this
 under
 this
 structure
 or
 we
 have
 you


know
 we
 have
 to
 Own
 100%
 or
 we
 can't
 buy


this
 division
 it
 may
 go
 to
 a


pre-investment
 committee
 again
 with
 more


people
 than
 in
 the
 group
 other
 senior


investors
 in
 the
 group
 and
 generally


when
 I'm
 seeing
 this
 is
 more
 towards
 the


end
 of
 the
 process
 so
 there
 the


percentage
 is
 higher
 because
 you've


already
 it's
 like
 you're
 going
 through


this
 Quality
 Control
 process
 so
 when


you're
 would
 you
 say
 50/50
 or
 more
 than


would
 go
 through
 well
 I
 would
 say
 when


it's
 getting
 to
 me
 it's
 a
 higher


percentage
 but
 remember
 it
 can
 still
 be


hey
 this
 doesn't
 work
 for
 us
 for


non-economic
 reason
 I'm
 concerned
 about


the


um
 you
 know
 legal
 or
 or
 press


ramifications
 is
 this
 I
 think
 we
 do
 a


good
 job
 of
 this
 but
 sometimes
 there
 are


those
 maybe
 pricing
 do
 you
 have
 to
 have


a
 thumbs
 up
 for
 it
 to
 pass
 we
 try
 to
 do


it
 in
 a
 consensus
 way
 I
 mean
 I
 know
 but


if
 you
 don't
 like
 it
 then
 it
 does
 not
 I


I
 I
 I
 try
 to
 do
 that
 rarely
 because
 I
 I


think
 you
 want
 to
 have
 this
 group
 sense


every
 once
 in
 a
 while
 there
 may
 be


something
 that
 I'm
 just
 like
 hey
 from
 my


standpoint
 what
 I'm
 trying
 to
 do
 is


signal
 things
 that
 I
 like
 like
 don't


like
 because
 generally
 within
 a
 fund
 or


strategy
 that
 one
 deal
 is
 not
 going
 to


be
 determinative
 of
 the
 future
 but
 if


it's
 a
 type
 of
 business
 that
 I
 don't


love
 then
 I'm
 signaling
 hey
 let's
 try
 to


do
 some
 other
 stuff
 but
 again
 if
 you
 had


this
 team
 uh
 who've
 been
 working
 for


months
 day
 and
 night
 because
 here
 they


work
 around
 the
 clock
 right
 this
 poor


they
 work
 very
 hard
 very
 hard
 so
 they've


been
 spending
 uh
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 time


on
 this
 and
 then
 you
 come
 in
 and
 you


just
 don't
 think
 it
 works
 does
 it
 make


you
 feel
 bad
 bad
 or
 good
 or
 badly
 I
 mean


I
 what
 I'd
 say
 is
 again
 the
 process
 is


more
 iterative
 if
 it's
 a
 regular
 way


deal
 in
 a
 sector
 we
 have
 high
 conviction


we've
 done
 a
 lot
 in
 this
 geography
 you


know
 or
 we've
 done
 a
 lot
 in
 this


particular
 area
 of
 software
 we've
 had
 a


ton
 of
 great
 success
 in
 it
 you
 know
 the


odds
 are
 it's
 going
 through
 and
 if
 we're


in
 an
 auction
 we're
 debating
 price
 that


sort
 of
 thing
 yeah
 what
 the
 teams
 have
 I


think
 really
 do
 well
 is
 when
 you
 find


something
 that's
 off
 the
 run
 and
 you


realize


it's
 got
 a
 feature
 to
 it
 that
 me
 or


other
 senior
 investment
 folks
 are
 going


to
 say
 uh
 then
 they'll
 pre-screen
 that


earlier
 oftentimes
 so
 it's
 not
 nearly
 as


much
 like
 you're
 up
 on
 some
 chair
 and


you
 go
 up
 and
 you
 go
 this
 or
 that
 it's
 a


much
 more
 iterative
 process
 and
 again
 if


you're
 within
 a
 business
 unit
 and
 the


deal
 team's
 supportive
 and
 the
 senior


Partners
 in
 the
 business
 are
 supportive


my
 view
 is
 unless
 I've
 got
 a
 really


strong
 reason
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 should
 be


saying
 you
 you
 know
 no
 I
 can
 be


highlighting
 things
 I
 view
 this
 as
 a


consensus
 driven
 process
 and
 if
 the


other
 nice
 thing
 is
 in
 a
 number
 of
 these


deals
 we
 have
 multiple
 investment


committees
 so
 we
 just
 did
 as
 I
 mentioned


one
 this
 morning
 and
 we
 had
 a
 ton
 of


questions
 so
 we
 just
 said
 to
 them
 like


go
 back
 these
 four
 areas
 you
 really
 got


to
 dig
 in
 on
 this
 and
 come
 back
 to
 us


and
 we'll
 have
 another
 meeting
 but
 um


consensus
 deals
 are
 they
 really
 the
 best


I
 mean
 do
 you
 really
 let's
 say
 now
 Mark


zuberg
 had
 come
 here
 you
 know
 yeah
 from


his
 Harvard
 dorm
 room
 and
 hey
 John
 uh
 do


you
 want
 to
 invest
 in
 this
 company
 I'm


connecting
 some
 people
 here
 and
 there


and
 you
 click
 and
 you
 like
 it
 do
 you


really
 think
 you
 would
 have
 said
 yes
 I


bet
 you
 would
 have
 said
 no
 yeah
 well


it's
 it's
 it's
 difficult
 to
 get


consensus
 for
 the
 best
 deals
 what
 I


would
 say
 is
 in
 our
 business
 that's


particularly
 hard
 in
 early
 stage
 VC


because
 it
 is
 much
 more
 of
 a
 gut
 thing


so
 much
 of
 what
 we
 do
 there
 are
 cash


flows
 there
 are
 histories
 we
 do
 have


views
 about
 what's
 happening
 in
 many


most


sectors
 I
 found
 that
 the
 deals
 when
 I


say
 consensus
 the
 driver
 of
 the
 deal
 is


not
 there's
 somebody
 who's
 the
 champion


who
 really
 believes
 in
 that
 yeah
 and


it's
 their
 job
 to
 convince
 the
 people


who
 are


skeptical
 and
 we've
 had
 people
 do
 that
 I


mean
 the
 how
 did
 we
 become
 the
 biggest


investor
 in
 data
 centers
 we
 had
 some


people
 who
 championed
 a
 large
 data


center
 transaction
 three
 and
 a
 half


years
 ago
 and
 it
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 a


brilliant
 decision
 to
 do
 that
 and
 they


were
 able
 to
 make
 the
 case
 for
 this
 so


um
 I
 think
 we
 as
 a
 as
 a
 firm
 do
 a
 good


job
 evaluating
 risk
 we
 don't
 always
 get


it
 right
 and
 it
 is
 harder
 when
 you're


going
 earlier
 stages
 but
 it
 feels
 to
 me


like
 most
 of
 the
 time
 we're
 we're


getting
 it
 right
 and
 what
 we're
 trying


to
 do
 is
 avoid
 really
 big
 mistakes


something
 that's
 structurally
 flawed
 or


if
 we
 think
 a
 business
 just
 doesn't
 meet


sort
 of
 that
 quality
 standard


what
 what
 kind
 of
 decision
 maker
 are
 you


are
 you
 a
 pattern
 recognition
 SL


gutfield
 kind
 of
 guy
 or
 analytical
 or


how
 do
 you
 shift
 between
 the
 I
 think


you've
 got
 to
 be
 both
 right
 because
 the


data
 tells
 you
 something
 right
 I
 mean


certainly
 you
 can
 look
 at
 a
 business
 um


you
 could
 say
 you
 know
 over
 the
 last
 20


years
 every
 year
 the
 the
 revenue
 of
 this


business
 has
 grown
 4%
 that
 tells
 you


something
 sounds
 more
 like
 a
 long-term


infrastructure
 asset
 um
 and
 you
 want
 to


look
 at
 what's
 happening
 under
 under
 the


hood
 you
 want
 to
 read
 the
 memo
 and
 look


at
 the
 numbers
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 the


past
 doesn't
 tell
 you
 the
 future
 the


past
 wouldn't
 tell
 you
 that
 data
 center


demand
 would
 go
 up
 20
 fold
 in
 two
 and
 a


half
 years
 the
 past
 wouldn't
 tell
 you


that
 power
 usage
 which
 in
 the
 United


States
 has
 been
 flat
 for
 20
 years
 is
 all


of
 a
 sudden
 going
 to
 go
 up
 by
 4%
 a
 year


going
 forward
 because
 of
 the


electrification
 so
 I
 think
 you
 need
 to


have
 both
 a
 quantitative
 side
 to
 you
 but


then
 an
 instinctual
 side
 that
 says
 look


this
 really
 feels
 good
 and
 by
 the
 way


the
 other
 area
 where
 it's
 really
 hard
 to


put
 on
 a
 piece
 of
 paper
 is
 management


teams
 abely
 because
 if
 you
 look
 in
 so


many
 Industries
 right
 there
 are
 five


players
 in
 the
 industry
 and
 one
 has


grown
 to
 enormous
 size
 three
 have


treaded
 water
 one
 went
 out
 of
 business


and
 they
 all
 had
 the
 exact
 same


conditions
 we've
 seen
 the
 same
 in
 the


Alternatives
 business
 so
 that
 is
 by


definition
 instinctual
 and
 so
 you've
 got


to
 really
 try
 to
 understand
 do
 we
 have


the
 right
 horse
 or
 it's
 a
 great
 business


and
 you
 need
 to
 change
 horses
 and
 the


potential
 is
 a
 lot
 greater
 than
 you


expect
 I
 actually
 uh
 uh
 for
 the
 sake
 of


f
 disclosure
 here
 I
 did
 a
 master
 um


thesis
 on
 decision-
 making
 and


interviewed
 the
 20
 best
 investors
 in


Europe
 to
 see
 what
 did
 they
 say
 well
 uh


so
 the
 best
 ones
 move
 between
 analysis


and
 gutfield
 now
 nobody
 wants
 to
 admit


when
 it's
 called
 gutfield
 but
 when
 you


call
 it
 pattern
 recognition
 they
 all


think
 is
 much
 better
 uh
 you
 you
 need
 to


be
 pretty
 senior
 to
 use
 it
 because
 uh


you
 need
 to
 be
 in
 a
 position
 where
 you


actually
 can
 trust
 your
 gutfield
 where


you
 don't
 have
 to
 back
 it
 up
 with
 a
 Lo


of
 analysis
 and
 of
 course
 nobody
 else


nobody
 trusts
 anybody
 else's
 gutfield


but
 it's
 it's
 it's
 a
 fascinating
 thing
 I


I
 do
 think
 if
 you
 think
 of
 investing


boil
 it
 down
 it
 is
 pattern
 recognition


it's
 connecting
 dots
 so
 our
 competitive


Advantage
 is
 230
 companies
 13,000
 pieces


of
 real
 estate
 and
 so
 we're
 getting
 all


this
 data
 so
 if
 you
 can
 connect
 that


data
 in
 a
 way
 and
 then
 transmit
 that


into
 investment
 then
 you
 have
 an


advantage
 in
 using
 your
 gut
 let's
 move


on
 to
 that
 how
 do
 you
 connect
 all
 these


dots
 right
 you
 you
 own
 all
 these


companies
 you
 own
 all
 these
 properties


do
 you
 have
 a
 systematic
 way
 of


organizing
 the
 signals
 and
 the


information
 you
 get
 from
 this
 I'd
 love


to
 say
 we
 have
 some
 Whopper


supercomputer
 that
 gives
 us
 all
 the


answers
 um
 we
 don't
 but
 I'd
 say
 we're


getting
 better
 and
 better
 so
 what
 we're


doing
 now
 is
 trying
 to
 pull
 the
 kpis
 the


key
 performance
 indicators
 from
 lots
 of


businesses
 particularly
 the
 larger
 sized


ones
 the
 infrastructure
 some
 of
 the
 real


estate
 portfolio
 companies
 some
 of
 our


biggest
 private
 Equity
 businesses
 that


give
 you
 data
 about
 what's
 happening
 in


wages
 what's
 happening
 in
 inflation
 and


then
 you
 try
 to
 share
 that
 um
 as
 broadly


as
 you
 can
 subject
 to
 limitations
 some


things
 have
 to
 be
 anonymous
 and
 so
 forth


across
 Chinese
 walls
 so
 capture
 that


data
 on
 a
 regular
 basis
 and
 share
 it
 we


do
 surveys
 on
 a
 quarterly
 BAS
 basis
 of


our
 companies
 where
 we'll
 ask
 do
 the


CEOs
 what
 are
 they
 seeing
 in
 terms
 of


Trends
 costs
 revenues
 do
 they
 think
 a


recessions
 coming
 in
 the
 third
 quarter


we
 asked
 you
 know
 do
 you
 see
 a
 recession


only
 16%
 of
 us
 CEOs
 see
 that
 what
 do


they
 see
 now
 they
 see
 a
 pretty
 good


economy
 I
 would
 say
 now
 our
 European


CEOs
 see
 a
 much
 tougher
 environment
 but


our
 us
 cosos
 this
 is
 even
 pre-election


saw
 pretty
 good
 environment
 they


generally
 see
 inflation
 coming
 down
 and


so
 for
 most
 of
 them
 they
 feel
 pretty


good
 there
 is
 weakness
 on
 the
 consumer


side
 a
 little
 bit
 some
 of
 that
 was
 there


was
 some
 covid
 boomed
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 price


and
 some
 of
 that's
 reversing
 but
 I'd
 say


most
 of
 them
 see
 a
 decent
 pretty
 decent


business
 environment
 and
 declining


inflation
 which
 has
 been
 helpful
 for


their
 margins
 are
 there
 any
 advantages


of
 being
 as
 big
 as
 you
 are
 I'd
 say
 the
 I


mean
 look
 scale
 has
 been
 our
 calling


card
 so
 one
 it's
 I've
 got
 all
 this


information
 and
 allows
 us
 to
 see
 things


in
 a
 differentiated
 way
 we
 certainly
 saw


inflation
 across
 our
 rental
 housing


portfolio
 or
 the
 biggest
 ports
 business


in
 the
 United
 States
 so
 definitely
 the


information
 it
 allows
 us
 to
 have


resources
 both
 at
 the
 firm
 and
 at
 our


companies
 so
 we
 can
 have
 50
 plus
 data


scientists
 we
 can
 have
 people
 on
 talent


management
 we
 have
 enormous
 scale
 on


purchasing
 and
 we
 can
 bring
 those
 to


bear
 at
 the
 companies
 we
 buy
 yeah
 but


you
 don't
 need
 you
 don't
 need
 a
 trillion


dollars
 to
 afford
 that
 no
 but
 definitely


helps
 but
 is
 is
 it
 is
 it
 more
 difficult


to
 generate
 returns
 I
 don't
 believe
 so


because
 in
 private
 markets
 it's
 an


advantage
 the
 other
 thing
 and
 what
 I'd


say
 on
 that
 is
 if
 you
 think
 about
 a


liquid
 Market
 something
 you
 know
 a
 lot


about
 if
 you
 want
 to
 buy
 a
 million


dollars
 a
 stock
 and
 I
 want
 to
 buy
 a


billion
 you've
 got
 the
 advantage
 because


I'm
 going
 to
 move
 the
 stock
 price
 yeah


it's
 the
 exact
 opposite
 in
 private


markets
 so
 when
 air
 trunk
 the
 biggest


data
 center
 company
 in
 Asia
 was
 up
 for


sale
 that
 we
 bought
 this
 summer
 for
 $16


billion


that
 because
 we
 could
 write
 the
 check


ourselves
 was
 a
 competitive
 Advantage


when
 we're
 writing
 a
 check
 for
 a
 three


billion
 doll
 loan
 and
 we
 can
 do
 that
 by


ourselves
 that's
 a
 competitive
 Advantage


same
 thing
 in
 secondaries
 all
 our


different
 activities
 so
 for
 us
 being


able
 to
 do
 big
 transactions
 is
 a


competitive
 Advantage
 having
 all
 the


information
 all
 the
 resources
 a


competitive
 advantage
 and
 then
 the
 other


thing
 I'd
 say
 is
 we
 become
 increasingly


sort
 of
 a
 fullservice
 capital
 solution


provider
 so
 if
 you
 come
 to
 us
 and
 say
 I


want
 senior
 investment
 grade
 debt
 we
 can


give
 you
 that
 from
 our
 insurance


companies
 I
 we
 can
 do
 Mez
 we
 can
 do


preferred
 Equity
 we
 can
 do
 minority


Stakes
 we
 can
 do
 control
 the
 whole
 range


of
 things
 and
 so
 it
 allows
 us
 to
 have


much
 more
 robust
 discussions
 with


corporates
 and
 other
 alternative
 firms


so
 we're
 finding
 scale
 as
 an
 advantage


the
 risk
 is
 that
 you
 lose
 the


entrepreneurial
 Spirit
 yeah
 that
 what


you
 end
 up
 with
 is
 a
 very
 bureaucratic


investment
 process
 people
 who
 stop


innovating
 and
 we
 just
 can't
 allow
 that


to
 happen
 we've
 got
 to
 make
 sure
 people


wake
 up
 here
 every
 day
 with
 a
 ton
 of


energy
 ton
 of
 dynamism
 and
 that
 we're


rewarding
 them
 in
 a
 real
 meritocracy
 for


finding
 new
 opportunities
 for
 taking


risk
 for
 generating
 great
 returns
 but
 if


you
 can
 harness
 the
 scale
 and
 keep
 that


dry


to
 me
 that's
 a
 special
 sauce
 you
 have


mentioned
 data
 centers
 a
 couple
 of
 times


and
 um
 it's
 been
 one
 of
 your
 themes


right
 yes
 and
 data
 centers
 is
 where
 the


big
 uh


hyperscalers
 uh
 you
 know
 have
 all
 their


computers
 to
 put
 it
 simply
 now
 uh


massive
 demand
 but
 also
 massive
 Supply


coming
 on
 are
 you
 worried
 about
 the


outlook
 for
 that
 I'm
 not
 in
 the
 near


term
 the
 the
 reason
 why
 one
 is
 obviously


the
 demand
 is
 enormous
 right
 the
 the


compute
 power
 putting
 those
 Nvidia
 gpus


together
 um
 what's
 happening
 Cloud


migration
 and
 now


ai
 it's
 just
 enormous
 and
 when
 you
 read


the
 earnings
 called
 and
 I
 read
 a
 summary


and
 you
 listen
 to
 the
 biggest
 tech


companies
 they
 are
 all
 in
 and
 they
 see


the
 potential
 so
 demand
 I
 see
 but
 your


point
 Nikolai
 which
 is
 totally
 right
 is


we
 saw
 it
 with
 railroads
 back
 in
 the


19th
 century
 we
 saw
 it
 with
 the
 build


out
 of
 cell


what
 tends
 to
 happen
 is
 people
 overbuild


yeah
 and
 at
 some
 stage
 for
 sure
 it
 will


happen
 here
 yes
 the
 difference
 when
 when


do
 you
 think
 it
 will
 happen
 there
 are


two
 limiting
 factors
 which
 have
 made


this
 much
 less
 prone
 to
 the
 bubble
 risk


that
 you
 would
 expect
 one
 is
 you
 do
 not


go
 out
 and
 build
 a$2
 billion
 speculative


data
 center
 nobody
 can
 make
 those


Economics
 work
 so
 you
 actually
 need
 a


long-term
 lease
 in
 place
 to
 do
 this
 so


that's
 limiting
 the
 second
 thing
 is


because
 you
 need
 power
 and
 power
 around


the
 world
 is
 increasingly
 insured
 Supply


yeah
 the
 negotiation
 with
 the
 tenant
 is


much
 more
 balanced
 than
 you'd
 expect
 so


if
 you've
 got
 a
 site
 that
 is
 approved


you
 have
 the
 knowhow
 how
 to
 build
 and


you
 have
 access
 to
 power
 you
 can
 sign
 a


long-term
 lease
 with
 the
 biggest
 and
 and


you
 know
 fastest
 growing
 companies
 in


the
 world
 today
 so
 that
 has
 protected
 it


but
 to
 your
 point
 we
 have
 to
 constantly


ask
 ourselves
 this
 is
 a
 good


neighborhood


is
 it
 getting
 you
 know
 over
 invested
 in


because
 my
 great
 neighborhoods
 are


valuable
 but
 if
 you
 pay
 way
 too
 high
 a


price
 or
 you
 buy
 a
 bad
 business
 in
 a


good
 neighborhood
 you
 could
 still
 lose


money
 today
 I
 would
 say
 if
 you
 have
 a


scale
 player
 and
 we
 have
 the
 biggest
 in


the
 US
 the
 biggest
 in
 Asia
 with
 the


biggest
 powered
 Land
 Bank
 in
 Europe
 and


you
 have
 the
 knowhow
 and
 the
 confidence


of
 the
 major
 tech
 companies
 and
 you've


gone
 out
 there
 and
 arranged
 to
 get
 power


I
 think
 you're
 in
 a
 pretty
 interesting


spot
 so
 we're
 still
 leaning
 in


but
 we're
 also
 playing
 it
 on
 a
 bunch
 of


derivative
 ways
 power
 generation
 power


transmission
 all
 sorts
 of
 backup
 power


we're
 helping
 companies
 like
 cor
 weave


we're
 doing
 financings
 we're
 financing


other
 people's
 data
 centers
 it's
 this


good
 neighborhood
 flood
 the
 Zone
 Theory


we
 feel
 like
 this
 has
 a
 long
 way
 to
 run


you've
 avoided
 Office
 Buildings
 and


shopping
 centers
 for
 a
 little
 while
 now


do
 you
 think
 it's
 time
 to
 go
 back
 in
 I


think
 it
 is
 interesting
 um
 we
 announced


uh
 yesterday
 a
 small
 shopping
 center


deal
 small
 by
 our
 stand
 standards


grocery
 anchored
 not
 big
 Regional
 malls


but
 think
 convenience
 retail
 because
 we


thought
 it
 represented
 good
 value
 and
 no


one's
 building
 shopping
 centers
 these


days
 and
 that
 to
 us
 means
 the
 lack
 of


new
 Supply
 even
 as
 e-commerce
 happens
 I


think
 there's
 an
 opportunity
 we
 like


grocery
 anchored
 harder
 to
 move
 online


less
 capex
 and
 then
 on
 Office
 Buildings


I
 would
 say
 um
 you
 want
 to
 focus
 on
 the


best
 quality
 Office
 Buildings
 I
 mean
 the


values
 have
 fallen
 very
 very


significantly
 we
 left
 Office
 Buildings


for
 the
 most
 part
 a
 while
 ago
 because
 we


were
 worried
 about
 the
 capital
 intensity


we
 didn't
 know
 covid
 was
 coming
 people


were
 going
 to
 stop
 coming
 to
 the
 office


but
 you
 need
 to
 own
 the
 very
 best


quality
 buildings
 and
 I
 would
 say
 buying


those
 buildings
 at
 a
 significant


discount
 is
 interesting
 but
 we'll
 do


that
 selectively
 you're
 also
 in
 private


equity
 and
 you
 built
 this
 up
 to
 be
 a


very
 very
 big
 business
 some
 people
 in
 my


part
 of
 the
 world
 are
 a
 bit
 skeptic


skeptical
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 private


Equity
 what


what
 are
 they
 right
 are
 they
 wrong
 what


well
 obviously
 as
 the
 biggest
 private


Equity
 investor
 we
 don't
 think
 they're


right
 I
 I'd
 say
 I
 think
 let's
 let's


start
 the
 other
 way
 what
 are
 the
 what


are
 the
 reasons
 to
 be
 skeptical
 to


private
 Equity
 the
 reasons
 to
 be


skeptical
 or
 why
 the
 business
 or
 how
 the


business
 started
 right
 if
 you
 went
 back


in
 time
 it
 was
 in
 the
 80s
 there
 was
 a


lot
 of
 Leverage
 used
 you
 were
 often


buying
 divisions
 of
 bigger
 public


companies
 they
 were
 were
 industrial


companies
 so
 leverage
 I
 they
 took
 on
 a


lot
 of
 loans
 lot
 of
 loans
 for
 money
 in


the
 bank
 they
 were
 the
 the
 return
 often


came
 from
 taking
 out
 maybe
 some
 cost


firing
 workers
 you
 weren't
 enhancing
 the


business
 that
 much
 you
 didn't
 have
 much


operational
 expertise
 it
 was
 mostly


Financial


Arbitrage
 if
 you
 flash
 ahead
 to
 what
 the


business
 is
 today
 it's
 very
 different


and
 you
 look
 at
 the
 two
 biggest
 deals
 we


did
 this
 year
 uh
 smart
 sheet
 which
 is
 a


workl
 flow
 uh
 software
 business
 or
 um
 we


did
 a
 large
 business
 Tropical
 Smoothie


in
 the
 fast
 food
 franchising
 business


these
 are
 fast
 growing
 businesses
 the


amount
 of
 Leverage
 we
 use
 is
 a
 fraction


of
 what
 was
 done
 in
 the
 past
 the
 returns


are
 going
 to
 come
 by
 enhancing
 growth


bringing
 in
 our
 resources
 to
 help
 these


companies
 grow
 faster
 and
 that's
 how


you're
 going
 to
 generate
 excess
 returns


so
 you
 hire
 so
 these
 companies
 will
 hire


people
 well
 they
 will
 hire
 people
 you'll


give
 them
 more
 resources
 to
 grow
 you


might
 expand
 them
 internationally
 and


what
 kind
 of
 expertise
 do
 you
 help
 them


with
 how
 you
 often
 times
 it
 could
 be


things
 like
 their
 go
 to
 market
 strategy


it
 could
 be
 how
 they
 organize
 themselves


to
 to
 sell
 it
 could
 be
 their
 quality


control
 it
 could
 be
 their
 marketing


you're
 bringing
 all
 these
 tools
 to
 Bear


of
 scale
 to
 the
 company
 and
 so
 what
 I


think
 we're
 the
 business
 started
 which


was
 a
 financial
 exercise
 and
 it's
 become


a
 much
 more
 operational
 growth
 oriented


business
 and
 and
 if
 you
 look
 I
 mentioned


Hilton
 before
 what
 Hilton
 was
 when
 we


bought
 it
 versus
 what
 it
 is
 today
 is


night
 and
 day
 and
 it's
 not
 just
 it's


done
 a
 great
 job
 for
 its
 employees
 for


its
 investors
 but
 it's
 also
 probably
 the


leading
 company
 on
 sustainability
 on


diversity
 they've
 done
 a
 terrific
 job
 as


a
 business
 and
 so
 so
 I
 think
 people
 have


in
 their
 minds
 that
 I
 think
 sometimes


the
 Press
 because
 there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of


money
 made
 in
 private
 Equity
 those


stories
 are
 not
 great
 and
 they're
 rarely


telling
 the
 stories
 of
 how
 somebody
 has


taken
 a
 business
 and
 really
 grown
 it
 and


created
 opportunity
 and
 created
 jobs
 and


so
 I
 think
 the
 nature
 of
 what
 we
 do
 you


know
 we
 have
 a
 career
 Pathways
 program


where
 we
 try
 to
 hire
 people
 from


underserved
 communities
 at
 our
 companies


um
 we
 have
 a
 program
 where
 we
 share
 some


of
 the
 rewards
 at
 some
 of
 our
 largest


companies
 I
 think
 what
 private
 Equity


was
 and
 what
 it
 is
 today
 are
 very


different
 and
 so
 that's
 part
 of
 the


reason
 why
 I
 think
 the
 returns
 and
 the


return
 premium
 is
 enduring
 now
 um
 you


also
 into
 private
 credit
 which
 is


lending
 money
 to
 companies
 kind
 of
 in
 a


you
 know
 going
 into
 the
 market
 of
 of


banks
 right
 and
 that's
 been
 exploding
 as


well
 why
 why
 has
 that
 gone
 up
 so
 much


that
 market
 so
 I
 I'd
 say
 a
 couple
 of


things
 first
 that
 has
 grown
 to
 be
 our


largest
 business
 by
 AUM
 it's
 430
 billion


doll
 um
 and
 we
 do
 it
 a
 little


differently
 than
 some
 of
 the
 other


players
 we're
 just
 a
 third
 party
 manager


so
 we
 haven't
 become
 an
 insurance


company
 been
 like
 a
 bank
 where
 you


borrow
 money
 and
 then
 make
 a
 premium


we're
 just
 doing
 it
 like
 we
 do
 in


private
 Equity
 or
 real
 estate
 as
 a
 third


party
 manager
 the
 reason
 the
 business
 is


exploding
 I'd
 give
 you
 three
 reasons
 one


is
 you're
 essentially
 bringing
 the


investor
 pension
 fund
 endowments


individual
 investors
 Sovereign
 wealth


fund
 right
 up
 to
 the
 borrower
 and
 you're


taking
 out
 a
 lot
 of
 origination


securitization
 financing
 costs
 it's


basically
 a
 farmtable
 model
 and
 that


ends
 up
 with
 the
 investor
 getting
 a


higher
 return
 they
 trade
 away
 a
 bit
 of


liquidity
 for
 that
 but
 they
 get
 a
 better


experience
 so
 if
 you're
 in
 the
 hold
 to


maturity
 business
 you
 get
 a
 higher


return
 the
 second
 thing
 I'd
 say
 is
 from


the
 borrower


standpoint
 because
 banks
 are
 often
 in


the
 distribution
 business
 they'll
 say
 to


the
 borrower
 the
 price
 is
 300
 over
 on


your
 loan
 but
 if
 I
 can't
 sell
 it
 at
 this


level
 I
 can
 Flex
 you
 to
 400
 over
 and


because
 we're
 running
 a
 storage
 business


not
 a
 moving
 business
 you're
 giving
 more


certainty
 to
 the
 borrowers
 the
 final


thing
 which
 is
 really
 helpful
 for
 the


financial
 system
 is
 we're
 duration


matching
 so
 if
 you
 think
 about
 First


Republic
 which
 went
 bust
 here
 in
 the
 US


they
 had
 a
 $70
 billion
 super
 Prime


Mortgage
 book
 that
 had
 almost
 no


defaults
 at
 all
 but
 they
 went
 bust


because
 the
 20-year
 mortgages
 were


against
 20
 22
 deposits
 yeah
 if
 they
 had


been
 held
 by
 a
 life
 insurance
 company


those
 mortgage
 loans
 there
 wouldn't
 have


been
 an
 issue
 do
 you
 think
 private


credit
 will
 be
 more
 regulated
 going


forward
 well
 I
 I
 think
 if
 the
 private


credit
 it's
 what
 we're
 doing
 which
 is


simply
 taking
 loans
 and
 directly
 putting


them
 on
 insurance
 company
 balance
 sheets


like
 they've
 done
 with
 mortgage
 loans


for
 a
 long
 time
 I
 think
 people
 will
 may


look
 more
 but
 I
 think
 that
 is
 different


now
 as
 private
 credit
 players
 become


more
 and
 more
 insurance
 companies
 take


on
 more
 annuities
 issue
 more
 debt
 they


probably
 will
 be
 more
 focused
 now
 I


would
 say
 our
 competitors
 are
 doing
 that


I
 think
 are
 doing
 a
 very
 good
 job
 and


they
 are
 they
 do
 have
 a
 longer
 duration


balance
 sheet
 than
 a
 bank
 and
 if
 you


really
 think
 about
 it
 the
 the
 mistakes


in
 financing
 blow
 up
 come
 from
 too
 much


leverage
 yeah
 and
 mismatch
 duration
 do


you
 think
 these
 things
 will
 be
 available


for
 private
 clients
 for
 retail
 clients


so
 far
 it's
 like
 big
 Institution
 who


have
 had
 access
 to
 private
 equity
 and


priv
 private
 credit
 well
 we
 actually


non-investment
 gr
 private
 credit
 what
 we


do
 in
 our
 bdcs
 lending
 to
 private
 Equity


managers
 that
 we
 do
 for
 individual


investors
 we
 have
 we
 have
 a
 product
 that


today
 has
 60
 billion
 of
 total
 AUM
 it's


the
 largest
 player
 in
 that
 space
 we
 also


have
 uh
 public
 BDC
 that
 you
 can
 buy


Blackstone
 secured
 lending
 so


individuals
 can
 access
 it
 for
 higher


yielding
 um
 and
 we've
 done
 very
 well


having
 these
 products
 for
 the
 last
 four


years
 I
 think
 they'll
 grow
 over
 time
 on


the
 investment
 grade
 side
 I
 think
 it'll


be
 some
 time
 before
 individuals
 get


access
 but
 I
 think
 they
 will
 as
 well


there
 there
 just
 won't
 be
 the
 same
 kind


of
 liquidity
 you
 joined
 this
 firm


straight
 off
 the
 school
 right
 yes
 we


happen
 to
 go
 uh
 to
 the
 same
 school


pretty
 much
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I
 think


even
 I
 think
 we
 may
 have
 been
 at
 the


same
 time
 did
 you
 graduate
 92
 yeah
 yeah


but
 uh
 I
 don't
 know
 whether
 you
 were
 in


the
 library
 and
 I
 was
 not
 or
 the
 other


way
 around
 uh
 perhaps
 you
 were
 more
 in


the
 library
 than
 me
 I'm
 not
 sure
 saw
 you


there
 actually
 no
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know


if
 it
 was
 in
 the
 library
 I
 I'm
 probably


a
 bit
 of
 Library
 bit
 of
 the
 fraternity


house
 I
 was
 fortunate
 I
 met
 my
 wife


there
 so
 she
 was
 also
 a
 class
 she
 looked


off
 to
 you
 yes
 now
 um
 when
 you
 joined
 it


was
 a
 small
 firm
 right
 uh
 now
 it's
 huge


um
 how
 is
 the
 corer
 culture
 different


you
 know
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 thing
 that's


probably
 kept
 the
 firm
 and
 kept
 it
 so


successful
 is
 that
 there
 is
 still
 sort


of
 a
 small
 firm
 mentality
 when
 I
 joined


it
 it
 was
 something
 like
 75
 people
 um


but
 we
 still
 stay
 remarkably
 connected


obviously
 it's
 bigger
 there's
 more


process
 but
 we
 try
 hard
 to
 keep
 sort
 of


this
 one
 firm
 one
 culture
 idea
 every


Monday
 we
 do
 something
 called
 Blackstone


TV
 which
 is
 an
 internal
 Zoom
 call
 where


we
 talk
 about
 what
 we
 see
 in
 markets


where
 we're
 investing


Capital
 what
 what's
 happening
 in
 the


economy
 and
 then
 we
 have
 a
 photo
 contest


so
 but
 also
 do
 you
 do
 you
 record
 it
 or


is
 everybody
 on
 is
 it
 a
 live
 Zoom
 call


it's
 live
 we
 just
 started
 recording
 it


because
 the
 people
 in
 Australia
 in


California
 rightfully
 said
 this
 is
 a


little
 crazy
 um
 but
 we
 basically
 are


trying
 to
 encourage
 everybody
 to
 tune
 in


and
 how
 long
 is
 it
 for
 it's
 for
 45


minutes
 can
 everybody
 speak
 no
 we
 have


guest
 speakers
 so
 it's
 we're
 we're


talking
 to
 the
 world
 but
 we
 bring
 guests


in
 from
 different
 parts
 of
 the
 firm


talking
 about
 it
 and
 it's
 it's
 designed


for
 people
 to
 understand
 what
 we're


doing
 understand
 the
 mission
 and
 have
 a


sense
 of
 you
 know
 why
 the
 firm's


succeeding
 how
 it's
 dealing
 with


challenges
 talk
 about
 some
 of
 the
 things


we
 do
 to
 give
 back
 in
 communities
 What


proportion
 of
 um
 the
 people
 here


actually
 watch
 it
 pretty
 high
 percentage


of
 the
 professionals
 we
 don't
 really


make
 it
 it's
 not
 so
 optional
 it's
 really


designed
 to
 be
 a
 way
 so
 that
 everybody


feels
 a
 collective
 sense
 of
 mission
 here


yeah
 well
 so
 we
 do
 exactly
 the
 same
 we


have
 a
 Monday
 meeting
 we
 do
 half
 an
 hour


everybody
 you
 know
 we
 have
 more
 than


more
 than
 half
 of
 the
 people
 in
 the
 v


tunes
 into
 that
 yeah
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 cool


thing
 I
 mean
 you
 it
 focuses
 in
 on
 why


we're
 there
 and
 if
 you
 think
 about
 going


back
 to
 some
 of
 these
 ideas
 about
 good


neighborhoods
 or
 when
 you
 see
 things
 if


we
 see
 things
 in
 our
 in
 inflation
 data


or
 economic
 data
 what's
 the
 best
 way
 to


communicated
 its
 scale
 than
 to
 get
 on


there
 and
 say
 we
 see
 this
 and
 this
 is


influencing
 how
 we're
 seeing
 things
 you


know
 we
 think
 inflation's
 coming
 down
 we


think
 the
 FED
 will
 thus
 you
 know
 lower


rates
 things
 we
 started
 saying
 18
 months


ago
 let's
 invest
 before
 the
 all
 clear


sign
 and
 what's
 the
 best
 sort
 of


bullhorn
 way
 to
 do
 that
 well
 an
 all
 firm


Zoom
 call
 with
 all
 your
 professionals


tuned
 in
 but
 again
 it's
 back
 to
 this


cultural
 idea
 of
 having
 people
 say
 like


oh
 there
 are
 nice
 people
 who
 work
 at


this
 place
 they
 care
 about
 others
 they


care
 about
 communities
 it's
 it's
 um


you're
 trying
 to
 give
 people
 a
 sense


that
 they're
 part
 of
 a
 broader
 purpose


obviously
 you're
 managing
 the
 the
 wealth


of
 a
 country
 and
 I'm
 sure
 the
 folks
 who


work
 for
 you
 not
 alone
 with
 a
 big
 team


yes
 but
 but
 everybody
 has
 a
 sense
 of


mission
 and
 so
 that's
 what
 I
 think


you're
 trying
 to
 inculcate
 Shared
 values


and
 how
 you're
 seeing
 the
 world
 yeah


what
 kind
 of
 people
 do
 you
 hire
 we
 try


to
 hire
 people
 who
 are
 obviously
 smart


hire
 people
 who
 are
 driven
 um
 I
 think
 if


you
 ask
 me
 one
 quality
 that's
 the
 most


important
 one
 you
 said
 it
 this
 is
 not
 a


9
 to
 five
 five
 day
 a
 week
 job
 most
 of


the
 people
 here
 work
 very
 hard
 and
 you


need
 somebody
 who
 really
 cares
 how
 do


you
 use
 how
 do
 you
 screen
 for
 drive
 you


know
 obviously
 you're
 you're
 finding
 out


where
 they
 used
 to
 work
 or
 what
 they
 do


sometimes
 there
 are
 telltale
 signs
 you


know
 people
 who
 are
 in
 athletics
 getting


up
 at
 5:
 in
 the
 morning
 people
 who've


you
 know
 came
 here
 as
 their
 parents
 were


immigrants
 and
 to
 get
 to
 some
 elite


school
 they
 had
 to
 do
 extraordinary


things
 to
 to
 get
 to
 where
 they
 have
 I


don't
 know
 you're
 trying
 to
 get
 a
 sense


of
 somebody
 who
 just
 really
 cares
 a
 lot


about
 what
 people
 who
 do
 people
 who
 put


in
 the
 longest
 hours
 do
 they
 do
 the
 best


ha
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 the
 longest
 hours


it's
 really
 about
 caring
 so
 I
 I
 would


say
 you
 you
 really
 care
 about
 what


you're
 doing
 and
 nobody's
 checking
 where


you
 at
 your
 Cube
 at
 8:32
 a.m.
 but
 do
 you


really
 care
 about
 the
 quality
 of
 the


presentations
 the
 quality
 of
 your


investment
 committee
 materials
 you


there's
 something
 about
 you
 that
 makes


you
 want
 to
 get
 it
 right
 but
 then
 I


would
 add
 to
 this


we
 want
 people
 who
 believe
 in
 team
 play


because
 investing
 in
 private
 markets


somebody's
 got
 to
 raise
 the
 money
 do
 the


Investments
 run
 the
 models
 somebody's


got
 to
 do
 the
 finance
 the
 legal
 deal


with
 the
 exit
 we
 need
 people
 who
 believe


in
 team
 play
 we
 need
 people
 who
 are
 nice


and
 you
 also
 need
 people
 with
 EQ
 because


you're
 not
 just
 trading
 on
 a
 screen


right
 you
 you're
 dealing
 almost
 all
 our


functions
 with
 people
 on
 the
 outside
 or


internally
 and
 so
 you're
 just
 trying
 to


get
 like
 really
 driven
 great
 people
 who


care
 a
 ton
 who
 have
 good
 judgment
 and


are
 nice
 and
 if
 you
 can
 find
 that
 that's


amazing
 are
 you
 nice
 I
 hope
 to
 be
 I
 try


to
 be
 but
 I
 I
 would
 say
 this
 Nikolai


that
 but
 your
 job
 is
 not
 to
 be
 nice


right
 I
 mean
 no
 I
 think
 my
 job
 is
 to
 to


want
 the
 best
 for
 the
 firm
 to
 be


demanding
 but
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 you
 can't


treat
 people
 well
 everybody
 up
 and
 down


and
 I
 would
 say
 this
 I
 think
 as
 Leaders


of
 businesses
 the
 most
 important
 signal


is
 who
 you
 hire
 who
 you
 fire
 who
 you


promote
 so
 if
 you
 give
 a
 big
 job
 to
 the


brilliant
 jerk
 who
 puts
 points
 on
 the


board
 but
 treats
 everybody
 terribly
 that


sends
 a
 very
 powerful
 signal
 and
 so
 I
 I


think
 trying
 to
 get
 people
 who
 are
 um


nicer
 better
 quality
 human
 beings
 who


also
 happen
 to
 be
 great
 at
 what
 they
 do


I
 think
 that
 helps
 you
 build
 a
 wonderful


culture
 and
 if
 you
 don't
 it's
 hard
 to


get
 people
 to
 State
 cuz
 it's
 not
 just


about
 financial
 rewards
 people
 who
 are


successful
 they
 want
 to
 be
 around
 people


they
 genuinely
 like
 I
 believe
 you


initially
 wanted
 to
 become
 a
 journalist


do
 you
 think
 it
 would
 have
 been
 a
 good


one
 I
 don't
 know


um
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 think
 I
 think
 I
 fell


in
 love
 with
 this
 investing
 thing
 so
 I
 I


mean
 I
 I
 so
 the
 thing
 is
 that
 it
 has
 a


lot
 in
 common
 right
 you
 need
 to
 be


really
 curious
 search
 for
 some
 kind
 of


truth
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


similarity
 cuz
 I
 have
 a
 daughter
 who


who's
 in
 the
 media
 business
 and
 does


podcasting
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 she
 does
 is


she's
 writing
 a
 story
 she's
 talking
 to
 a


lot
 of
 people
 she's
 reading
 a
 bunch


she's
 trying
 to
 get
 the
 facts
 and
 then


she's
 telling
 a
 narrative
 and
 drawing
 a


conclusion
 and
 to
 your
 point
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 similarity
 and
 if
 you
 said
 to
 me


what
 do
 I
 love
 the
 most
 about
 the


investing
 business
 it's
 this


intellectual
 excitement
 to
 try
 to
 figure


out
 where
 the
 world's
 going
 yeah
 and
 to


analyze
 something
 and
 come
 to
 a


conclusion
 and
 you
 see
 the
 world
 somehow


slightly
 differently
 than
 other
 people
 M


and
 as
 a
 result
 you
 express
 a
 view
 and


unlike
 most
 other
 jobs
 you
 literally


know
 afterwards
 I
 put
 $100
 in
 that
 did
 I


lose
 it
 did
 I
 get
 back
 a
 hundred
 or
 did


I
 get
 back
 300
 yeah
 I
 just
 think
 it's


the
 most
 interesting
 thing
 you
 could
 do


you
 know
 it's
 like
 everything
 you
 eat


and
 drive
 and
 wear
 is
 made
 by
 somebody


it's
 about
 psychology
 it's
 about


management
 it's
 about
 greed
 and
 fair


macro
 geopolitics
 uh
 you
 know
 everything


changes
 you're
 doing
 it
 around
 the
 world


and
 so
 you
 know
 next
 week
 I'll
 be
 in
 the


middle
 least
 the
 following
 week
 I'll
 be


in
 Asia
 you're
 learning
 you're
 talking


to
 people
 you're
 just
 trying
 to
 take
 in


as
 much
 information
 and
 you're
 trying
 to


transform
 that
 into
 actionable


Investments
 talking
 about
 being
 around


the
 world
 and
 action
 so
 you
 are
 a
 runner


you
 run
 all
 over
 the
 world
 and
 you
 post


on
 LinkedIn
 yes
 tell
 me
 about
 it
 I
 it's


very
 funny
 so
 when
 I
 travel
 I
 I
 often


would
 send
 my
 family
 uh
 my
 wife
 and


daughters
 you
 know
 a
 clip
 saying
 oh
 here


I
 am
 am
 I'm
 in
 some
 around
 the
 world
 you


may
 forget
 who
 I
 am
 and
 whatever
 and
 I


got
 on
 LinkedIn
 about
 a
 year
 ago
 I


thought
 you
 know
 I
 did
 sort
 of
 the


corporatist
 stuff
 at
 the
 beginning
 and


it
 wasn't
 that
 interesting
 to
 me
 and
 I


was
 in
 Sydney
 jogging
 by
 the
 opera
 house


and
 I
 was
 like
 wow
 this
 is
 amazing
 I


love
 being
 here
 we
 have
 a
 big
 business


here
 A
 bunch
 of
 people
 clients
 so
 I


literally
 just
 took
 the
 camera
 and
 said


I'm
 in
 Sydney
 this
 and
 that
 and
 I
 put
 it


I
 sent
 it
 to
 our
 people
 and
 they
 put
 it


on
 LinkedIn
 and
 all
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 the


thing
 sort
 of
 goes
 viral
 so
 you
 don't


have
 to
 be
 that
 smart
 it's
 like
 oh


there's
 demand
 for
 Last
 Mile
 Logistics


let's
 buy
 more
 Last
 Mile
 Logistics
 in


this
 case
 there
 is
 demand
 for
 you
 know


these
 LinkedIn
 sort
 of
 human
 videos


showing
 you
 jogging
 I
 do
 that
 and
 so
 you


do
 it
 in
 se
 you
 do
 it
 in
 California
 and


what's
 the
 what's
 the
 coolest
 place
 you


run
 the
 coolest
 place
 I
 run
 you
 know
 I
 I


would
 say
 I
 always
 love
 Washington
 DC


when
 I
 jog
 up
 to
 seps
 to
 the
 Lincoln


Memorial
 it
 has
 this
 sort
 of
 profound


feeling
 to
 me
 um
 I
 love
 in
 Japan
 there's


a
 5k
 jog
 around
 sort
 of
 the
 Imperial


Gardens
 where
 the
 Emperor's
 Palace
 is


obviously
 the
 cities
 in
 Europe
 all
 have


great
 runs
 along
 the
 water
 you're


supposed
 to
 say
 Oslo
 I
 should
 say
 Oslo


is
 great
 CU
 that
 Main
 Street
 in
 Oslo


what
 is
 that
 up
 to
 the
 parliament
 at
 the


top
 is
 a
 great
 is
 a
 great
 run
 too
 but
 it


you
 know
 when
 you
 travel
 one
 of
 the


things
 you
 know
 is
 it's
 just
 hard
 on


your
 body
 yeah
 so
 if
 you
 can
 get
 up
 and


go
 out
 and
 it
 doesn't
 you
 don't
 need
 to


run
 a
 marathon
 you
 could
 run
 two
 or


three
 miles
 and
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 you
 feel


a
 little
 better
 about
 the
 day
 ahead
 and


um
 this
 has
 been
 fun
 but
 I've
 sort
 of


created
 a
 monster
 and
 I've
 joked
 at
 some


point
 I'll
 jump
 the
 shark
 but
 for
 now
 I


keep
 going
 absolutely
 Joan
 what
 is
 your


advice
 to
 young
 people
 I
 think
 it
 goes


back
 to
 some
 of
 the
 earlier
 stuff
 which


is
 you
 got
 to
 really
 work
 hard
 you
 got


to
 care
 a
 ton
 about
 what
 you're
 doing


and
 I
 think
 that
 ties
 to
 the
 passion
 I


think
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 we're
 having


success
 at
 what
 we
 do
 is
 because
 we
 like


it
 right
 and
 if
 you
 don't
 feel
 this


genuine
 passion
 for
 what
 you're
 doing
 I


think
 it's
 hard
 and
 you
 should
 find


another
 career
 the
 other
 advice
 I
 would


say
 is
 don't
 be
 afraid
 to
 speak
 up
 I


think
 one
 of
 the
 challenges
 often
 times


particularly
 people
 show
 up
 at


businesses
 and
 they
 sit
 quietly
 and
 you


know
 once
 you
 start
 to
 get
 a
 sense
 of


what
 makes
 this
 business
 you're
 working


at
 tick
 could
 be
 a
 nonprofit
 organiz


whatever
 it
 is
 you
 want
 to
 be
 an
 agent


for
 Change
 and
 almost
 every
 company


Blackstone
 included
 can
 do
 things
 better


you
 can
 serve
 your
 customers
 better
 you


can
 shorten
 some
 of
 the
 paperwork
 you


can
 find
 a
 new
 market
 a
 new
 opportunity


if
 you
 think
 of
 yourself
 as
 an


entrepreneur
 and
 an
 agent
 of
 change
 in


whatever
 you're
 doing
 it
 makes
 your
 job


more
 fun
 the
 people
 you
 work
 with
 really


appreciate
 it
 you
 get
 more
 out
 of
 it
 and


then
 the
 final
 thing
 I'd
 say
 is
 wherever


you
 work
 you
 want
 to
 be
 feel


intellectually
 challenged
 you're
 still


learning
 I
 think
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 the
 best


part
 of
 the
 job
 is
 this
 constant


learning
 that's
 why
 I've
 never
 looked


for
 another
 job
 because
 I'm
 always
 like


wow
 I'm
 learning
 something
 new
 so
 if
 you


go
 to
 a
 place
 and
 you
 feel
 like
 you're


continually
 moving
 up
 in
 terms
 of
 what


you're
 learning
 what
 the
 challenge
 is


finding
 that
 kind
 of
 opportunity
 again


gives
 you
 a
 lot
 of
 psychological
 Rewards


well
 John
 you
 for
 sure
 have
 passion
 and


working
 very
 hard
 and
 if
 you
 are
 looking


for
 another
 jail
 I'm
 show
 we
 can
 fit
 you


in
 somewhere
 I
 will
 I
 will
 not
 be


looking
 but
 I
 love
 seeing
 you
 here


Nikolai
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 thank
 you
