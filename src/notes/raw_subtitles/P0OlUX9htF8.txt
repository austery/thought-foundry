From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Tuesday,
 October
 21st.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


[Music]


A
 federal
 appeals
 court
 has
 cleared
 the


way
 for
 the
 Trump
 administration
 to


deploy
 National
 Guard
 troops
 in


Portland,
 Oregon,
 over
 the
 objections
 of


the
 state's
 governor.
 Months
 of
 protests


outside
 an
 ICE
 facility
 there
 led


President
 Trump
 to
 say
 the
 city
 needed


to
 be
 protected
 from
 domestic


terrorists.
 A
 lower
 court
 judge
 blocked


the
 guard
 deployment
 earlier
 this
 month,


calling
 Trump's
 portrayal
 of
 the


situation
 simply
 untethered
 to
 the


facts.
 But
 in
 the
 latest
 ruling,
 appeals


court
 judges
 cited
 a
 number
 of
 instances


where
 demonstrators
 had
 thrown
 rocks
 and


sticks,
 attempted
 to
 set
 fires
 at
 the


ICE
 building,
 or
 shot
 paintballs
 at


officers.
 One
 judge
 wrote
 that
 that
 was


enough
 to
 support
 the
 deployment


decision.
 Quote,
 even
 if
 the
 president


may
 exaggerate
 the
 extent
 of
 the
 problem


on
 social
 media,
 lawyers
 for
 the
 state


have
 already
 pushed
 for
 an
 appeal.
 So


the
 legal
 wrangling
 is
 likely
 to


continue.
 Meanwhile,
 the
 fight
 over


whether
 the
 president
 can
 unilaterally


send
 troops
 into
 US
 cities
 is
 also
 still


playing
 out
 in
 Illinois.
 Deployments


there
 are
 currently
 blocked,
 but
 the


Trump
 administration
 has
 now
 asked
 the


Supreme
 Court
 to
 weigh
 in
 on
 an


emergency
 basis.


Just
 9
 months
 into
 Trump's
 term,
 his


administration
 has
 made
 more
 of
 those


emergency
 appeals
 than
 the
 Biden
 White


House
 made
 in
 four
 years.
 and
 the


Supreme
 Court
 has
 sided
 with
 the
 Trump


administration
 nearly
 every
 single
 time.


The
 rulings,
 which
 are
 part
 of
 what's


sometimes
 called
 the
 shadow
 docket,


frequently
 offer
 little
 or
 no


explanation
 for
 the
 Supreme
 Court's


decision.
 And
 while
 the
 orders
 are


technically
 temporary,
 they've
 allowed


Trump
 to
 take
 significant
 actions
 like


deporting
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 people
 or


slashing
 government
 spending,
 again,


often
 with
 little
 or
 no
 explanation
 from


the
 justices.
 The
 Times
 has
 found
 that


for
 many
 lower
 court
 judges
 that's
 been


confusing
 and
 frustrating.


>> We
 started
 to
 wonder,
 well,
 can
 we
 get
 a


sense
 of
 just
 how
 widespread
 these


frustrations
 are?
 And
 so,
 we
 decided
 to


just
 start
 reaching
 out
 to
 judges,
 as


many
 as
 we
 could,
 one
 by
 one.


>> Matathi
 Schwarz
 covers
 the
 courts
 for


the
 Times.
 He
 sent
 out
 a
 questionnaire


to
 hundreds
 of
 federal
 judges
 about
 the


flood
 of
 emergency
 rulings.
 and
 some
 of


them
 responded
 and
 spoke
 with
 Matt
 on


the
 condition
 of
 anonymity,
 calling
 the


orders
 troubling
 and
 a
 slap
 in
 the
 face.


One
 said
 that
 the
 courts
 were
 in
 the


midst
 of
 a
 judicial
 crisis.
 One
 thing


that
 came
 across
 in
 some
 of these


conversations
 is
 how
 demoralizing
 the


last
 few
 months
 have
 been
 for
 district


court
 judges
 writing
 these
 60
 70
 page


opinions
 under
 intense
 time
 pressure
 and


then
 to
 see
 them
 summarily
 reversed
 by


emergency
 orders
 that
 provide
 no


reasoning.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 part
 of


these
 judges
 that
 really
 wants
 to
 see


the
 Supreme
 Court
 engage
 with
 what


they're
 saying
 and
 engage
 with
 their


interpretation
 of
 the
 law.
 And
 42
 of
 the


65
 judges
 who
 responded
 to
 our


questionnaire
 said
 they
 felt
 that
 the


Supreme
 Court's
 use
 of
 the
 emergency


docket
 had
 caused
 some
 degree
 of
 harm
 to


the
 public's
 perception
 of
 judiciary


since
 President
 Trump
 returned
 to


office.
 And
 that
 is
 a
 a
 really
 really


serious
 statement.
 They're
 saying
 the


Supreme
 Court
 is
 hurting
 the
 courts
 as
 a


whole
 in
 the
 eyes
 of
 the
 public
 and


they're
 the
 ones
 often
 who
 have
 to
 deal


with
 that
 because
 they're
 the
 ones
 on


the
 front
 lines.

This
 morning,
 Air
 Force
 2
 touched
 down


in
 Israel
 as
 Vice
 President
 JD
 Vance


arrived
 to
 try
 and
 hold
 together
 the


fragile
 peace
 deal
 between
 Israel
 and


Hamas.
 His
 visit
 comes
 as
 several


administration
 officials
 tell
 the
 Times


there's
 growing
 concern
 in
 the
 White


House
 that
 Israeli
 Prime
 Minister


Benjamin
 Netanyahu
 could
 dismantle
 the


agreement
 and
 resume
 an
 all-out
 assault


in
 Gaza.
 Just
 a
 week
 ago,
 Trump
 himself


was
 in
 Israel
 to
 celebrate
 the
 first


phase
 of
 the
 US
 broker
 deal
 to
 end
 the


war.
 But
 after
 a
 flare
 up
 in
 violence
 in


recent
 days,
 members
 of
 Netanyahu's


hardline
 government
 called
 for
 the


Israeli
 offensive
 to
 restart,
 quote,
 at


full
 strength
 is
 there.
 I
 when
 you
 talk


about
 Hamas,
 you're
 talking
 about
 40


different
 cells.
 It's
 disjointed.
 Some


of
 those
 cells
 will
 probably
 honor
 the


ceasefire.
 Many
 of
 those
 cells
 will
 not.


Ahead
 of
 his
 trip,
 Vance
 acknowledged


that
 some
 fighting
 was
 likely
 to


continue
 despite
 the
 ceasefire,


suggesting
 even
 a
 best-case
 scenario


would
 involve
 what
 he
 described
 as
 fits


and
 starts
 between
 Israel
 and
 Hamas,


which
 has
 so
 far
 refused
 to
 lay
 down
 its


weapons.
 We
 before
 we
 actually
 can


ensure
 that
 Hamas
 is
 properly
 disarmed,


that's
 going
 to
 require,
 as
 we
 know,


some
 of these
 Gulf
 Arab
 states
 to
 get


forces
 in
 there
 to
 actually
 apply
 some


some
 law
 and
 order
 and
 some
 security


keeping
 on
 the
 ground.


>> Under
 the
 current
 proposal
 for
 the
 next


phase
 of
 the
 ceasefire,
 an
 international


stabilization
 force
 made
 up
 of
 troops


from
 various
 countries
 would
 come
 into


Gaza
 to
 secure
 the
 territory
 and


facilitate
 aid
 distribution
 among
 other


things.
 But
 what
 exactly
 that
 force


might
 look
 like
 is
 one
 of
 many
 sticking


points
 in
 the
 ongoing
 negotiations
 with


some
 of
 the
 countries
 seen
 as
 likely


participants
 saying
 they
 won't
 commit


troops
 just
 yet
 out
 of
 concern
 that


their
 soldiers
 could
 be
 in
 danger
 or


that
 they
 could
 be
 seen
 as
 occupiers
 of


the
 territory.

Now,
 three
 other
 quick
 updates
 on
 the


Trump
 administration.
 The
 Secretary
 of


Transportation
 Shawn
 Duffy
 is
 warning


that
 the
 nation's
 air
 traffic


controllers
 are
 about
 to
 get
 paychecks


for
 zero
 dollars
 because
 of
 the


government
 shutdown
 and
 that
 American


travelers
 could
 feel
 the
 effects.


>> I
 think
 what
 you
 might
 see
 is
 more


disruptions
 in
 travel
 as
 more
 of
 them


look
 to
 say,
 "How
 do
 I
 bridge
 the
 gap


between
 the
 check
 that's
 not
 coming
 and


putting
 food
 on
 my
 table?"
 And
 we've


heard
 they're
 taking
 Uber
 jobs.
 They're


uh
 doing
 door
 dash,
 figuring
 out
 ways
 to


uh
 keep
 their
 families
 afloat.


>> The
 White
 House
 had
 previously
 suggested


it
 might
 find
 ways
 to
 shift
 federal


dollars
 around
 to
 keep
 the
 controllers


paid
 in
 the
 same
 way
 they've
 repurposed


Pentagon
 funds
 for
 active
 duty
 troops,


but
 Duffy
 said
 yesterday
 that
 there's
 no


current
 plan
 to
 do
 that.
 That
 is
 set
 to


add
 to
 the
 stress
 the
 controllers
 are


already
 facing
 with
 many
 of
 them
 pulling


overtime
 shifts
 to
 make
 up
 for
 severe


staffing
 shortages.
 The
 government
 has


now
 been
 shut
 down
 for
 20
 days
 and


lawmakers
 on
 Capitol
 Hill
 are
 no
 closer


to
 reaching
 an
 agreement
 to
 reopen
 it.


Also,
 as
 of
 last
 night,
 all
 but
 two
 of


the
 nine
 universities
 the
 White
 House


tried
 to
 get
 to
 sign
 a
 so-called
 compact


to
 steer
 them
 towards
 the
 president's


priorities
 have
 rejected
 the
 proposal.


The
 administration
 had
 suggested
 the


schools
 could
 get
 preferential
 access
 to


federal
 funds
 if
 they
 agreed
 to


statements
 like
 academic
 freedom
 is
 not


absolute
 and
 pledged
 to
 potentially
 shut


down
 parts
 of
 their
 institutions
 that


the
 administration
 claims
 punish
 or


belittle
 conservative
 ideas.
 While
 the


University
 of
 Texas
 suggested
 it's
 open


to
 signing
 on,
 other
 schools
 including


Brown,
 Dartmouth,
 USC,
 UVA,
 and
 the


University
 of
 Arizona
 have
 now
 said


explicitly
 that
 they
 won't.
 With


Arizona's
 president
 writing,
 quote,


"Principles
 like
 academic
 freedom,


merit-based
 research
 funding,
 and


institutional
 independence
 are


foundational
 and
 must
 be
 preserved."


And
 at
 the
 White
 House
 yesterday,


construction
 crews
 demolished
 part
 of


the
 East
 Wing
 to
 clear
 the
 way
 for


President
 Trump's
 90,000
 square
 foot


state
 ballroom.
 He
 said
 the
 renovations


are
 necessary
 to
 be
 able
 to
 host
 things


like
 state
 dinners,
 which
 have


previously
 been
 held
 under
 tents
 on
 the


White
 House
 lawn.
 In
 all,
 the
 ballroom


is
 expected
 to
 cost
 more
 than
 $200


million.
 And
 last
 week,
 Trump
 hosted
 a


lavish
 dinner
 for
 dozens
 of
 wealthy


donors
 who've
 agreed
 to
 help
 cover
 the


costs.
 Representatives
 from
 Amazon,


Apple,
 Google,
 Microsoft,
 and
 other


companies
 attended,
 leading
 some
 ethics


watchd
 dogs
 to
 allege
 that
 the
 project


is
 basically
 a
 pay-to-play
 scheme
 to


curry
 favor
 with
 the
 president.

A
 new
 study
 has
 found
 that
 the
 rate
 of


peanut
 allergies
 in
 American
 children


dropped
 significantly
 after
 new


guidelines
 were
 put
 out
 about
 when
 to


introduce
 babies
 to
 the
 food.
 For


decades,
 experts
 recommended
 that


parents
 avoid
 exposing
 their
 babies
 to


common
 allergens.
 But
 after
 research


showed
 that
 letting
 babies
 try
 peanuts


could
 cut
 their
 chances
 of
 developing
 an


allergy,
 the
 recommendations
 changed.


Starting
 in
 2017,
 national
 guidelines


formally
 recommended
 the
 early


introduction
 approach.
 The
 new
 study


published
 in
 the
 journal
 Pediatrics


shows
 that
 in
 the
 years
 after
 the


switch,
 peanut
 allergies
 in
 children


under
 three
 plummeted
 43%.


The
 study
 didn't
 look
 at
 what
 the
 kids


ate,
 so
 it
 doesn't
 show
 that
 the
 changed


guidelines
 directly
 caused
 the
 decline.


Still,
 experts
 say
 the
 data
 is


promising.
 Peanut
 allergies
 can
 be


lethal,
 and
 the
 majority
 of
 kids
 who


have
 them
 never
 outgrow
 them.

And
 finally,
 back
 in
 April
 1992,
 the


Times
 ran
 a
 front
 page
 article
 with
 the


headline,
 "Scientists
 report
 profound


insight
 on
 how
 time
 began."
 Now,
 the


Times
 is
 remembering
 the
 Nobel
 Prize


winning
 physicist
 integral
 to
 that


discovery,
 George
 Smoot.
 He
 died


recently
 at
 age
 80.
 Smoot
 led
 a
 team


that
 helped
 confirm
 that
 the
 big
 bang


was
 the
 source
 of
 the
 universe.
 They
 did


it
 by
 measuring
 tiny
 variations
 in
 the


temperature
 of
 light
 in
 space
 known
 as


the
 cosmic
 microwave
 background.
 Steven


Hawking
 called
 it
 the
 greatest
 discovery


of
 the
 century,
 if
 not
 of
 all
 time.


Smoot
 went
 on
 to
 share
 a
 Nobel
 Prize
 for


his
 work.
 Though
 over
 his
 career,
 some


of
 his
 colleagues
 raised
 concerns
 he


didn't
 always
 give
 credit
 where
 credit


was
 due
 to
 others
 who
 worked
 on
 the


research.
 So,
 I'm
 thinking
 you
 won
 the


Nobel
 Prize
 what,
 three
 years
 ago.
 So,


you
 must
 deal
 with
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 what


has
 Smoot
 done
 lately.


>> In
 his
 later
 years,
 leveraging
 his
 space


cred,
 Smoot
 made
 appearances
 on
 the
 CBS


sitcom,
 The
 Big
 Bang
 Theory.


>> Let's
 start
 with
 first
 grader
 science.


>> And
 in
 2009,
 in
 what
 seems
 kind
 of


unfair
 for
 a
 Nobel
 Prize
 winner,
 he


competed
 on
 the
 game
 show,
 Are
 You


Smarter
 than Than
 a
 Fifth
 Grader.


>> George,
 I'm
 not
 a
 gambling
 man.
 I'm


going
 to
 bet
 on
 you
 on
 this
 one.
 All


right.


>> Unsurprisingly,
 he
 won
 a
 million


dollars.


>> Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 Today
 on
 the


Daily,
 Nicole
 Hannah
 Jones
 on
 how
 the


Trump
 administration
 has
 upended
 decades


of
 work
 around
 civil
 rights.
 You
 can


listen
 to
 that
 in
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 app


or
 wherever
 you
 get
 your
 podcasts.

 Mumford.
 We'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow.
