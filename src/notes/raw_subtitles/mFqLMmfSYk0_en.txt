So I think if you watch the bear, it
makes sense that there is such a thing
as a culinary producer.
Yes, but maybe if
you didn't watch the bear, you wouldn't
even know it was a job.
I actually didn't know it was a job.
You know, that makes that makes three of
us.
What is it?
So what exactly is your day like when
you're on set?
I think that's a fair question.
But a culinary producer deals with kind
of macro and micro issues of the show.
So I work very closely with Christopher,
who is the creator of the Bear, also my
brother.
And then, you know, the the writing team
and I kind of kind of help inform some
of the character development based on my
own personal experience.
And then every day on the show, I'm
there.
I do work hand in hand with my culinary
team.
And we do all the food,
We cook it.
We don't have food.
Stylist So everything you see on the
show, we run it like an actual
restaurant.
So we have a full team.
But I'm also there to help sort of work
with, you know, the film department set
decoration props to make sure we are as
accurate as possible.
And it kind of I wear a lot of different
hats.
So wherever they need me, I go.
But I definitely use the script to
inform the direction of the food.
And then I'm responsible to work with
the cast to kind of bring those things
to life.
And as you see on the show, these is
actors are actually cooking, so we don't
use hand doubles like they're doing it.
So it has such a thing as hand doubles
and cooking, of course.
All right.
So, okay, first of all, it's like the
food is I mean, I want to say it because
the actors on the show are incredible,
but it's like the main actor.
So how hard is it to do what you do?
It's actually it's it's challenging, but
it's very fun because I'm coming from
the real restaurant world.
I'm a chef, you know, I've been a chef
here in Los Angeles for many years.
I've been in the restaurant world
forever.
And I think bringing these things to
life takes a lot of, like, information
of all the restaurants that I've been in
and then doing it on camera and then
having it not only look great, but time
and temperature sensitive wise, we shoot
very, very fast.
So it really is a team effort to be
like, this is the dish and getting
everybody in the loop of how and when to
shoot it, when it's perfect, you know,
when things melting or washing or like,
Right.
Yeah.
So you have this background as a chef,
you have a background as a chef, You
have a background in culinary training.
Yes.
Matty Mathison, of course, is an actual
chef.
Jeremy Island White did go to.
Yes, a couple of weeks of culinary.
Yeah, I did, too.
Yes.
I went.
Lisa, when they all spent time with me
directly here in Los Angeles, in my
kitchen, my catering kitchen, where we
trained to work on some specifics for
the show that would be done on camera.
As you see, you know, Tina's character.
She's, you know, filling Bronzino in
culinary school and she's left handed.
So how we filmed that scene and how she
had to practice that scene, it's like we
have to actually apply these skills so
that they read on camera and it's been
so helpful for their own journey to
actually experience culinary school,
working with chefs, staging in
restaurants, and then actually doing it
on camera really helps them get it
right.
Yeah, go ahead.
What were they like at the beginning?
Because it wasn't like.
I think everyone.
Well, I think there was crazy.
I mean, I always very she loves food.
So like, I feel like Jeremy, I.
Oh, Lionel, you know, Liza, they all
have passion for food, so that helps.
And they were eager to get it right.
And I don't want to dismiss.
Yes.
You know, they've just they they've come
a long way.
Different skill.
Yes, they've come a long way.
And I see the effort that they put on
each season.
And remember, now we're going into our
fifth season, so we practice before we
go to film each each year.
So they're building their skills as we
go.
So my wife worked in kitchens, so we
would watch the show together and she'd
be like, This is what?
It's actually like the masking tape and
labeling things.
And like we actually drank out of those
like to go container.
We call them delis.
Okay, That's what it's like.
I worked at Taco Bell, so I have no idea
what's important.
It's but it's not like this at all.
But I got to tell you, like, after
watching a few episodes of the first
season, I'm like, Who wants to do this?
The pressure is crazy.
You're getting paid a fraction.
It's like you're it's like the pressure
of being a brain surgeon without any of
the pay.
Yeah.
And the hours are worse.
Yeah, I think that's a really good
question.
And I think what the show does kind of
do a really good job at is show some of
the difficulties and some of the
wonderful things, like there is so much
camaraderie, chemistry, teamwork in
kitchens that gets you coming back every
day.
I learn so much about who I am as an
individual by the challenge of, you
know, running restaurants, line cooking.
Not only do I develop my skills as like
an actual chef, but I think as a person,
I've learned so much from every single
person that I've been in a kitchen with,
and that's from the porters to the
dishwashers to the front of house host
to, you know, the head chef.
There is always something to learn in
kitchens, and it's fine.
It's actually quite fun.
It's stressful.
Yes.
But there is a reason that people come
back every day.
All right.
So tell us something where something got
burned or what
does that happen a lot in on the show.
Yeah, well, when you're like, go win
because your timing is so important.
Of course.
Of course.
There's a lot of setting each other up
for success.
And I have to say, like, without my
culinary team, we are very diligently
working to make the best of everyone's
time that is working alongside us.
And there's a huge, incredible camera
department that we're, you know, being
mindful of them holding these heavy
cameras and, you know, getting it right.
So we practice a lot before we actually
shoot.
There is a lot of work on the
preproduction side before we have
cameras rolling.
It's really important that we come and
like bring our A-game because we don't
want things to burn.
Of course, like we have to redo dishes
of ice cream melts or something like
that, but we make sure we're prepared to
set up everybody first, like like
anything else in terms like you just
say, everybody's on their A-game.
We treat it like service.
We treat it like a dinner service.
You want to change your job?
Yeah.
No, I don't think it's in my DNA.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think you'd be surprised,
though.
I think some of my best cooks can never
cut a day in their life.
Really?
Yeah.
So there's.
There's hope for everyone over here.
If you've got passion, I can teach you.
