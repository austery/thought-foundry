- [Derek] As the sun
rose on July 2nd, 1937,
Amelia Earhart knew she was in trouble.
Over the radio, she called,
"We must be on you but cannot see you.
Gas is running low.
Been unable to reach you by radio.
We are flying at 1,000 feet."
Beneath her was water
in every direction as
far as the eye could see.
She got herself into this predicament
through a series of unfortunate
events and bad decisions.
Many of them could have been avoided
with a better knowledge of physics.
But even so,
there was one thing she could
have done in this moment,
one switch she could have flipped
that would likely have saved
her life and changed history.

More about them at the end of the show.
Amelia Earhart was vying to
become the first female pilot
to fly around the world.
- I hope to accomplish something
really scientifically
worthwhile for aviation.
- And she wasn't taking any shortcuts.
Other successful circumnavigations
had followed a northern route,
mostly staying close to land.
But Earhart's route would be the longest
by following a path close to the Equator.
This meant the last part of
her journey was the hardest,
crossing the full width
of the Pacific Ocean.
The starting point for
this crossing was Lae,
a city on the eastern side of New Guinea.
At the time, it was one of
the world's busiest airports,
a hub of traffic from Asia and Australia.
At 10:00 a.m. on a hot July day,
Earhart piloted her Lockheed
Electra down the runway
and took off on what
would be her final flight.
The Pacific Ocean is huge.
It's way bigger than the Atlantic.
I mean, if you look at
the globe from that side,
you see almost no land.
The problem was, in 1937,
most planes could only fly a maximum
of a few thousand kilometers,
so Earhart removed everything
unnecessary from her plane.
She ripped out the
insulation to reduce weight,
but that made the engine
noise so overwhelming
she had to communicate with her navigator
sitting right beside her
using written notes.
She packed almost nothing,
telling her husband,
"Extra clothes and extra food
would have been extra
weight and extra worry."
She replaced the passenger
seats with fuel tanks,
effectively turning her
plane into a flying gas can.
But even so, the Electra's maximum range
was between 6,600 and 7,200
kilometers in perfect weather.
It could be just enough
to reach Hawaii from Lae,
or she might come up disastrously short.
So Earhart needed a place to
stop and refuel along the way.
Now, it might seem like
there's no land here,
but if you zoom in,
there is this tiny island
halfway between Australia and Hawaii.
Howland Island is just
over two kilometers long
and less than one kilometer wide.
The US had claimed it
as part of the Guano Islands Act of 1856.
But in 1937, it was barely inhabited
with just a handful of colonists.
It would be an ideal location to refuel,
if only it had a runway.
Fortunately for Earhart,
by the time of her
around the world flight,
she was already famous.
In 1928, she became the
first female passenger
to cross the Atlantic by airplane.
This made her an international celebrity.
- [Announcer] She said
she could, and she did it.
(lively music)
- [Derek] But she wanted
to fly herself, saying,
"Maybe someday I'll try it alone."
So, in 1932,
she attempted to pilot a
plane solo across the Atlantic
heading for Paris.
She brought with her only a toothbrush,
one container of soup and
three cans of tomato juice.
(thunder booms)
But storms, ice, and dense
fog battered her small plane.
A seam in the exhaust manifold cracked
and flames from the engine
spewed out into the night.
Gas leaked down her
neck from a broken tank,
and after 14 hours,
she landed in a pasture
in Northern Ireland.
Her face was so covered in grease,
a farmhand couldn't tell if
she was a man or a woman.
He asked if she had flown far.
"From America," she replied.
- I wish I could have done it faster.
- [Derek] These adventures brought her
into the orbits of powerful people,
like the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt.
- And Mrs. Roosevelt,
won't you go for a ride
tonight over Washington?
It's really lovely from the air at night.
- And using her new connections,
she lobbied the president to
hire her friend, Eugene Vidal,
to head the Bureau of Commerce.
Vidal had promised Earhart
a runway on Howland Island,
but red tape stalled progress
only months before her planned takeoff.
So Earhart wrote directly
to President Roosevelt.
She explained that the airstrip funds
required immediate approval,
writing, "Please forgive
troublesome female flyer
for whom this Howland
Island project is key
to world flight attempt."
The president approved the
project four days later,
and three runways were soon cleared.
So she had a place to land,
but how would she find this
tiny speck of an island
in a vast ocean?
Well, flying with her in the Electra
was her navigator, Fred Noonan,
and he would calculate the flight plan.
They knew the direction of Howland,
so they could use the onboard compass
to set their bearing toward it.
They knew their air speed
and could figure out their ground speed
by subtracting or adding the wind,
and then they could calculate
how long it should take
to reach the island.
This method is known as dead reckoning.
But they wouldn't aim
directly at the island,
because if they did that
and they didn't see it
at the prescribed time,
they wouldn't know in which
direction they were off.
So instead, they
intentionally picked a point
either north or south of the island.
Let's say they picked south.
They estimated the trip
would take 18 hours,
so they would fly through day and night.
And once they had traveled
for the calculated length of time,
they could confidently turn
north and spot the island.
Before takeoff, the ground crew estimated
they would encounter a headwind
of 24 kilometers per hour.
But just 20 minutes after takeoff,
Lae radioed Earhart to warn
that the headwinds would be stronger.
She didn't acknowledge their message.
Knowing the correct
wind speed was critical
because it would affect
how long it would take
to reach the island.
If it took longer, Earhart
would have to turn later.
So she couldn't rely
on dead reckoning alone
to reach Howland.
As an independent check on their location,
Noonan would take measurements
of the sun, moon, and stars.
This is known as celestial navigation.
He had an almanac that
listed 58 navigation stars
and the point on Earth each
one would be directly overhead
for the day and time of his measurement.
If they found themselves
directly under a navigation star,
well, then they would
immediately know their position.
But generally they
would not be that lucky,
so Noonan would measure
the angle above the horizon
to a navigation star
and use that to work out
how far away they were
from the point on the Earth
where that star would
be directly overhead.
So he could trace out
a circle on the globe
of possible locations,
and then he would measure the angle
to another navigation star
and draw out a second circle.
And now they must be
at one of these two circle intersections.
Normally the circles were so large
that only one of the intersections
would be a plausible position.
That way they could continually
update their location
and adjust bearings as needed.
But even with celestial navigation,
errors could accumulate over long trips.
Earlier in the journey, when
Earhart crossed the Atlantic,
they missed their intended
airport in hazy conditions.
Noonan's calculations were reasonable,
but small errors put them off course.
Luckily, in Africa,
there were plenty of other
places to land safely.
The same could not be said for Howland.
So, for the flight across the Pacific,
Earhart commandeered three US
Navy and Coast Guard ships.
The Itasca would be
stationed at Howland Island,
the Ontario would be
halfway along the route,
and the Swan was positioned midway
between Howland and Hawaii.
The Itasca would send out smoke signals
as Earhart approached to
help her spot the island.
But even more importantly,
all ships were equipped with radio.
Now, in 1937, radio was
still fairly new tech.
German physicist Heinrich
Hertz discovered radio waves
in the late 1880s.
He excited electrons to
oscillate back and forth
in his transmitter,
and a few meters away his
receiver was a loop of wire
with a small gap in it.
When Hertz looked at it through
a microscope in the dark,
he saw faint sparks
jumping across the gap.
The sparks were strongest when
the receiving loop was flat.
If it was vertical, then
no sparks were observed.
This demonstrated that radio
waves are transverse waves
with electric and magnetic fields
oscillating perpendicular to each other
and perpendicular to the
direction of the wave motion.
When the receiving loop was aligned
with the direction the wave was traveling,
the changing magnetic
field through the loop
induced an EMF that created the spark.
But if the loop was
facing the transmitter,
then there was no change in
magnetic flux through the loop,
and so no spark was observed.
Now, Hertz couldn't see the
future he had ushered in.
He said, "I do not think
that the wireless waves I have discovered
will have any practical application."
But within a few years,
people started sending
messages using radio.
And by the 1920s, radio
entertainment broadcast took off.
Ships and planes routinely
used radio to send Morse code,
and some, including Earhart,
could send and receive voice messages.
In fact, Earhart had five radio
antennas around the plane,
each for a specific purpose.
The largest antenna could
be reeled in and out
like a fishing line behind the plane.
It was 76 meters long,
which was necessary
to efficiently send and receive Morse code
via the 4 or 500 kilohertz radio waves
used by ships and remote stations.
Ideally, an antenna should be
at least 1/4 of the wavelength
of the radio wave it's
transmitting or receiving.
This improves the efficiency
of the conversion from electrical energy
to radiated electromagnetic energy.
Earhart's trailing antenna
was only around 1/8 of the wavelength.
But it was connected to
a high-power transmitter,
so its signals could still be detected
over 1,000 kilometers away.
Next were two antennas
for voice communications
on higher frequencies.
A transmitting V antenna
on the roof of the plane
and a receiving antenna along its belly.
Higher frequencies were
useful for two reasons.
First, they require smaller antennas,
which save weight and can
be better accommodated
on small sparse planes.
And second, high frequency radio waves
can travel long distances
by bouncing off a layer of the atmosphere
called the ionosphere.
Starting about 50 kilometers
above Earth's surface,
radiation from the Sun splits
electrons off molecules
forming a layer of ions
and free electrons.
Radio waves with certain frequencies
interact with these free electrons
and are effectively
reflected back to Earth.
It's as if they've bounced off
a big wobbly mirror in the sky.
This effect is called skipping
and it scatters radio
waves all over the place.
These radio waves can
then reflect off the ocean
and back off the ionosphere,
making multiple hops to travel
thousands of kilometers.
During the daytime,
the intense radiation from the sun
means the ionosphere starts
lower in denser atmosphere.
And because of this,
lower frequency radio
waves are more likely
to be absorbed than reflected.
So aviators would typically
use the higher 6210 kilohertz
to skip their signals during the day,
and then the lower 3105 kilohertz at night
once the bottom of the
ionosphere had lifted
into thinner air.
Four hours after takeoff,
Earhart radioed an update to Lae
on her daytime frequency of 6210.
She reported her altitude at 7,000 feet
and speed at 140 knots
before concluding with
her typical sign-off, "Everything okay."
But she never acknowledged calls from Lae
about the headwind.
They radioed again at 11:20 and 12:20,
but never got a response from Earhart.
In all likelihood, she never heard them.
She did radio six hours into her flight
to report stronger headwinds,
but she makes no mention
of Lae's earlier warnings.
It's possible the receiving belly antenna
was broken, fell off,
or something in the receiving
electronics wasn't working.
But her ability to receive voice messages
was clearly impaired.
Nine hours into the flight,
Earhart expected to come upon the Ontario.
She listened for Morse
code Ns on 400 kilohertz,
but she heard nothing.
The original plan was
that the Ontario would
wait for her to radio them
to request that they start transmitting.
But the day before takeoff,
Earhart realized she had made a mistake.
The Ontario had told her
they wouldn't be able to receive
any high frequency signals,
which meant no voice communication.
So she sent an urgent
telegram asking the Ontario
to transmit the Morse code Ns repeatedly
10 minutes after each hour.
The purpose of the Morse
code from the Ontario
was actually to allow Amelia Earhart
to make use of her two final antennas.
So she had a loop antenna
just like this one
and a sense antenna.
These were designed to allow her
to locate the source of radio waves.
This was the final and most critical way
that Earhart planned to stay on course
and locate Howland Island.
She wrote, "I doubt if I'd try the flight
to tiny Howland Island
without it supplementing
Fred Noonan's skill."
Woo. Alright, so I have an antenna here
and I'm aligning it
vertically in this tree.
How are we, how are we there?
So the Ontario was sending
out Morse code signals
on their antenna,
and here we have a transmitter
tuned to about 3.6 megahertz.
I'm gonna put on this blindfold
and use the loop antenna to
try to locate the transmitter.
And because I already know
where the transmitter is,
we'll spin me around a few
times to really disorient me.
So, Clifford. Oh, sorry.
- [Clifford] Oh, which way are you going?
- Alright. Whoa, I'm a bit dizzy.
So the radio waves are gonna
be emitted in all directions
radially away from the antenna,
the electric field will be
oscillating up and down,
and the magnetic field will
be oscillating back and forth.
So if I hold up this loop like this
sort of parallel to the direction
that the waves are traveling,
then the magnetic field
is gonna be changing
through the loop.
And because of that,
it's going to create an EMF and current
and I can pick that up
because I'm tuned to the
right frequency here.
So I got a fairly strong signal.
Woo, it's very strong.
But if I rotate the loop like that,
well, now the magnetic field
is oscillating back and forth
but not changing through the loop itself
because it's parallel to the loop.
And so, in this orientation,
I'm gonna get a null reading.
If I turn it this way, there's a null.
But if you turn it 90 degrees,
now all the magnetic field
is passing through this loop
and so I can hear a maximum here.
So this is what Earhart wanted to measure
using her loop antenna
to detect the repeated N
Morse code from the Ontario.
She would turn it until she found the null
and then she would know
the direction to the ship.
Something that's interesting
is, if I turn it away,
we get another null because again
there's no magnetic flux
passing through this loop.
Now, the first time she
picked up the signal,
she would probably be heading
straight towards the ship
or close enough,
so she would know that
it's roughly that way.
But there's a chance
that she's gone past it.
And if you go past it, well,
then you also get a null,
but the ship is behind
you, not in front of you.
So that's where the
sense antenna comes in.
The sense antenna gives you
a cardioid pickup pattern
so it has a single null
instead of two nulls,
and so that allows you to determine
whether it is in front or behind you.
- [Clifford] If you walk a bit,
you'll know if it's
getting weaker or stronger.
- Alright, I feel like I've
picked the wrong direction.
I'll try the sense antenna to
see if I can figure it out.
With the sense antenna,
the only null points directly
away from the transmitter,
so it's easy to use the sense antenna
to check which null is correct
but then only use the loop when navigating
because it gives a sharper null.
I think using the sense antenna
that the transmitter's
right in front of me now.
I'm looking for another null here.
Oh, there's a null.
- [Clifford] Give it a go.
- There, there. Definitely louder, louder.
Oh, it's funny 'cause
you move a little bit
and then you start hearing signal again.
This does not feel like I'm
walking in the right direction.
- [Clifford] Well, that's
either the right way to go
or it's the wrong way to go.
- Oh no.
(Clifford laughs)
- Trying to fly a plane and
do this would be very hard,
especially with the sound of that engine
would have been roaring.
Oh, I feel like it's getting loud.
It's really loud here.
It drops out right there.
I mean, there's a null here.
And I was convinced
this was the right way.
Yeah, this is a clear null right here.
Whoa. Loud, loud, loud.
I feel like I've gotta be close.
(antenna humming)
It's gotta be like right here.
Whoa! Ah! (laughs)
This worked amazingly well.
I had no idea I was that
close, that's impressive.
- On the nail.
- That's awesome.
Now, aviators could have used
where the signal is loudest
and try to go in that direction,
but it's actually easier
to get a precise null,
a point where the signal drops out.
The loud section could
range for quite a distance
and so you wouldn't
really know where it is,
but the null is more precise
so that's why they
would look for the point
where the signal drops out.
If Earhart could hone in on the Ontario
using her radio direction finding loop,
that would ensure she was on course
and eliminate any navigation errors
that may have occurred to that point.
But her telegram asking the Ontario
to transmit 10 minutes after each hour
didn't make it to the ship in time.
And since Earhart couldn't
talk to the Ontario,
they never sent out any signals.
So they passed like ships in the night.
By this point, Earhart was
around halfway to Howland.
With no other landing strips
within 1,000 kilometers,
she would have to find the tiny
island or return to Lae now.
But multiple delays had
already plagued her journey.
In fact, this was not
Earhart's first attempt
to fly around the world.
Earlier that year, in March of 1937,
she had taken off from
California for Hawaii,
heading west instead of east.
On board were Fred Noonan
and another crew member, Harry Manning.
As a Merchant Marine captain,
he was an expert in radio, Morse code,
and traditional navigation.
He was also a pilot.
The flight to Hawaii was successful
thanks in part to Manning
using the loop antenna
to hone in on a radio beacon
on the destination island.
Three days later, the trio
set off for Howland Island.
But just as they were taking off,
the plane drifted to the right.
Earhart corrected by
throttling back the left motor,
but it was too much.
The plane turned to the left
and the right wing dipped down.
Going up on one wheel, the
right landing gear collapsed,
then the left.
The plane skidded out on its belly,
spinning around to face
the way it had come.
Thankfully, no one was hurt,
but the Electra took months to repair.
And during that time, the
seasonal winds shifted.
So, on her next attempt,
Earhart would have to
fly east instead of west.
And most importantly, Captain
Manning left the crew.
Officially, the press reported
that he needed to return
to the Merchant Marines,
but rumors spread that he had
lost confidence in Earhart,
or that Earhart believed
Noonan was a better navigator than Manning
and she could operate
the radio on her own.
Whatever the case,
when Earhart took off
again three months later,
she was accompanied only by Noonan.
And now they had made it 80%
of the way around the world.
And in the dark of night,
Earhart had to make the critical decision
whether to keep going or turn back.
The lack of signal from the Ontario
must have been concerning,
but maybe they never got her telegram.
And she knew that at Howland,
the Itasca would be
transmitting the letter A
over Morse code every half hour,
even if they didn't hear from her.
And they could send and
receive voice signals.
They promised to be ready
on a range of different frequencies.
So she flew on.
Around 6:15 a.m. local time,
radiomen aboard the Itasca
heard Earhart clearly.
"Please take a bearing on 3105.
We'll whistle into the mic.
We are about 200 miles out."
She then began to whistle.
But the men were confused.
They expected Earhart to
take a bearing on them,
not the other way around.
And while they had told her
that they had radio
direction finding equipment,
the signal needed to be lower frequency,
between 270 and 550 kilohertz.
Her voice frequency would
skip off the ionosphere
and reflect off the ocean,
scattering in all directions.
So there would be no way to find a null
because the signal would be coming
literally from everywhere.
In the Electra, Earhart heard only static.
By now, she must have been worried
that they hadn't heard
anything from either ship.
Almost blind from the rising sun
and deaf from the roar of the engines,
Earhart twisted the radio dial,
listening for Itasca's response. Nothing.
She may have expected Howland
to have a high frequency
radio direction finder
called an Adcock antenna array.
These systems solve the skipping problem
with five vertical antennas
at the corners and center of a square.
The direction of the radio wave
can be calculated from the
slightly different arrival times
and signal strengths at each antenna.
But these antennas were massive,
so they were really only
installed at larger airports.
Now, as it happens,
there was a portable high
frequency radio direction finder
on Howland Island,
but the operator reported
that Earhart's transmissions
didn't last long enough
for him to take a bearing.
And trying to conserve his low battery,
he missed parts of the
later transmissions.
Around 6:45, Earhart again asked them
to take a bearing on 3105 kilohertz
and report back in a half hour.
But a bearing taken now and
reported back in a half hour
would be at best outdated
and at worst misleading.
This confusion likely had
to do with time zones.
Earhart was using Greenwich Civil Time,
but the Itasca set their clocks
to their current position
which was GCT -11.5 hours.
And to make matters worse,
Howland Island used Hawaii Time,
which back in those days
was GCT -10.5 hours.
So the three parties
attempting a rendezvous
on a tiny island in the
middle of the Pacific
were on three different time zones.
And crucially, Earhart's
hours didn't even line up
with the others.
Earhart told the Itasca
she would be using GCT,
but somehow it never
made it to the radiomen.
So, when the Itasca
heard Earhart's request,
it was 6:45 a.m.
But in the cockpit, it was 6:15 p.m.
So Earhart likely didn't
say "in a half hour"
but "on the half hour,"
which for her was only 15 minutes away.
And also it was a prearranged time
that Earhart would be listening for them.
Earhart was careful to set
times she would transmit
and times she would listen for the ship
because she could only
power one antenna at a time.
And the ships used the same antenna
for receiving and transmitting,
so if they both broadcasted
at the same time,
they would miss each other's messages.
If Earhart sent another message
at a quarter after the hour,
the Itasca blocked it
with their own message.
"Cannot take a bearing on 3105 very good.
Please send on 500, or do you
wish to take a bearing on us?
Go ahead please."
There was no response.
But she couldn't transmit
on 500 kilohertz anyway
because she had removed
the long trailing antenna
that could transmit lower frequencies.
Since it could only be
used for Morse code,
something neither she nor Noonan
were particularly well versed in,
she saw it as dead weight
after Manning left.
So, after the Hawaii crash,
it was removed during repairs.
So she had no way of sending radio waves
that would allow the Itasca
to take a bearing on her.
But she could take a bearing on the Itasca
using her loop antenna,
if they sent her the right frequency.
Before the trip, the
Itasca had asked Earhart
to specify the frequency
they should broadcast.
Earhart was unsure,
so she consulted a radio expert in Lae
and they recommended the
Itasca send Morse code A,
just repeated dot dashes,
on the half hour at 750.
But at that time it was typical
to talk about radio waves
using their wavelength,
so the expert had meant 750
meters or 400 kilohertz.
But Earhart made a terrible mistake
relaying this plan to the Itasca.
She requested the signal
be sent on 7,500 kilohertz
instead of 750 meters or 400 kilohertz.
But she did explicitly say,
"If frequencies mentioned
unsuitable, inform me."
But no one ever corrected her.
At 7:42 a.m.,
Earhart's voice came through so loud
men even went above deck to
see if they could hear a motor
or spot the plane.
She said, "We must be on
you but cannot see you.
But gas is running low.
Been unable to reach you by radio.
We are flying at 1,000 feet."
On Howland, the high frequency
radio direction finder
was so low on battery
the radiomen didn't even
hear Earhart's message,
much less take a bearing on it.
10 minutes later, Earhart said,
"We are circling but cannot hear you.
Go ahead on 7,500."
The Itasca immediately
sent As on 7,500 kilohertz.
In the Electra, Earhart
heard the stutter stop of As
filling the cabin.
The relief of finally hearing something
must have been overwhelming.
She quickly turned her
radio direction finding loop
to locate the null,
but the signal never dropped out.
The frequency was too high,
so the radio waves from
the Itasca were reflecting
and arriving from different directions.
Joseph Gurr, a radio mechanic
who worked on Earhart's plane,
later said that they knew
there were limitations
to high frequencies
which had a tendency to skip and bend,
creating a false radio direction bearing.
Without a minimum, she was still lost.
Earhart frantically called Itasca.
"We received your signals
but unable to get a minimum.
Please take a bearing on
us and answer with voice."
Itasca attempted to explain the problem.
"Your signals received okay.
It is impractical to take
a bearing on your voice."
No response. Without the belly antenna,
she probably never heard
any of their communications.
And it wouldn't have mattered
if the Itasca had sent
low frequency signals
because Earhart's loop was tuned
to pick up 7,500 kilohertz.
So, why didn't the Itasca
correct the frequency she suggested?
Commander Thompson of the Itasca
was aware of her radio
direction finding limits.
He had received messages
both from Earhart's
husband, George Putnam,
and the Coast Guard's
San Francisco division
stating Earhart could only take bearings
on frequencies between
200 and 1,500 kilohertz.
But he either thought Earhart knew more
about her radio equipment,
or that it wasn't his
place to make suggestions
and take more responsibility
for her flight.
When she asked the Itasca
to tell her if these
frequencies weren't suitable,
she could have been referring
to the ship's capabilities
rather than her own.
The Itasca said they'd be ready
on the frequencies she wanted and more
instead of giving specific suggestions.
San Francisco's Coast Guard division
tried to get Commander Thompson
to take more responsibility
for Earhart's radio communications
by suggesting they directly tell Earhart
which frequencies to use.
But Thompson essentially
told them to butt out.
The Itasca communicated directly
with Earhart from then on.
The radiomen continued
to try to reach Earhart,
and just before 9:00 a.m.,
Earhart's voice suddenly
burst through again.
"We are on the line 157-337.
We will repeat this on 6,210 kilohertz.
We are running on line north and south."
Her voice was desperate.
It sounded as if she was
about to burst into tears or scream.
This was the last
message the Itasca heard.
There are a number of conspiracy theories
about what happened to Earhart after that,
but the evidence seems clear.
She ran out of fuel
somewhere over the Pacific
and crashed into the sea.
Two hours after her last message,
the Itasca left Howland
to search north and west for the Electra.
Other Navy and Coast
Guard ships and planes
joined the search for over two weeks.
To that point in US history,
it was the most intensive and expensive
search and rescue operation,
costing around $4 million,
which is almost 100
million in today's money.
No one has ever found a
trace of Noonan, Earhart,
or her Electra.
All of these mistakes
could have been resolved
if Earhart had two-way communication,
but her belly antenna
somehow malfunctioned.
Some theories suggest
it fell off during takeoff in New Guinea,
but without physical evidence,
it's impossible to say.
But Earhart did confirm receiving signals
on her loop antenna.
Her loop could only direction
find with lower frequencies,
but it could receive
signals on a wide range.
If she had switched to using the loop
for all communications,
she could have received
Itasca's voice messages
and then the Itasca could have requested
she take a bearing on a lower frequency,
which would have guided her
safely to Howland Island.
When I began researching this video,
I expected to find
that Amelia Earhart's
demise was inevitable.
That what she was trying
to do was just so difficult
that nothing could have saved her.
But instead, I found the opposite.
There were at least a half dozen things
that if they went differently
would have allowed her to land safely.
So to me, this story
comes down to two things.
Knowledge and responsibility.
Earhart lacked knowledge of radio systems,
which would've allowed her to specify
the right direction finding frequency.
But Commander Thompson of the
Itasca had that knowledge.
He knew her direction finding limits,
but he didn't take on the
responsibility to correct her.
When attempting any challenging endeavor,
you need someone with the right knowledge
who will also take responsibility
for getting things right.
That's what you need
to battle the inherent chaos
and disorder of the universe.
Otherwise, what you get is disaster.
This video was sponsored by KiwiCo,
so I thought it would be appropriate
to build their
radio-controlled delivery bot.
But my oldest kid was
out for the afternoon,
so I sat down to make it by myself,
but very quickly I was joined
by my 4-year-old and 6-year-old
who were really excited to help.
You know, we have been getting
KiwiCo delivered to our door
for years now
and it's one of my kids'
favorite things to do with me.
They have a lot of fun
while we're also spending
quality time together.
And somewhat secretly,
they're also learning,
not only technical knowledge,
but also knowledge of how
simple and understandable
machines that at first
appear complex can be.
I think it's great that
they're getting hands-on
with wheels and motors
and radio transmitters.
I think it enables them to
build up this resilience
and an attitude that, well,
I can understand that,
I could probably build that.
And KiwiCo takes responsibility
for ensuring everything you
need is right in the box,
which means no extra trips to the store.
When a crate turns up,
you can sit down right
away and get into it.
They have something for kids of all ages
and each crate is designed by experts
and rigorously tested by kids
to make sure it promotes
learning and engagement
and is just generally really fun to do.
I noticed that their
instructions keep getting better
with helpful hints to ensure
you've done everything correctly.
And with KiwiCo Labs for ages six and up,
kids use the problem-solving
skills they've developed
to engineer cool games,
robots, or everyday products.
