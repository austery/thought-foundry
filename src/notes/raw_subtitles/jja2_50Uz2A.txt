It's
 Rachel
 in
 Tel
 Aviv.
 Before
 we
 get


to
 the
 rest
 of
 today's
 show,
 here's
 an


update
 from
 the
 Middle
 East.


On
 Monday,
 after
 Hamas
 returned
 20


living
 hostages
 from
 Gaza,


Israel
 began
 releasing
 nearly
 2,000


Palestinian
 prisoners
 back
 to
 Gaza
 and


the
 West
 Bank.


Large
 crowds
 gathered
 near
 Nasser


Hospital
 in
 Kyunis,
 where
 released


Palestinian
 prisoners
 were
 taken.


Good
 afternoon.
 Good
 evening.


Hi,
 Mustafa.
 It's
 nice
 to
 hear
 your


voice.
 I
 talked
 to
 Mustafa
 Abu
 Taha,
 an


English
 teacher
 in
 Gaza
 I've
 been
 in


touch
 with
 since
 the
 start
 of
 the
 war.


Mustafa,
 can
 you
 describe
 the
 scene
 when


the
 Palestinian
 prisoners
 returned?
 What


did
 it
 look
 like
 outside?
 He
 was
 there


amongst
 the
 crowd.


This
 is
 I
 would
 say
 the
 biggest,
 the


largest,
 the
 most
 enormous
 a
 crowd
 I


have
 ever
 seen
 in
 my
 life
 in
 Gaza.
 I


have
 seen
 mountains
 of
 people.
 So
 you


know
 words
 are
 not
 enough
 to
 describe


how
 people
 you
 know
 are
 feeling
 so


amazed
 and
 all
 of
 them
 start
 waving,


shouting,
 dancing.
 I
 dance
 and
 I
 sang
 a


song.


What
 did
 you
 sing
 Mustafa?


Freedom
 is
 back.
 Freedom
 is
 back.


After
 two
 years
 of
 devastation,


destruction,
 mass
 killing,
 the
 war
 has


come
 to
 an
 end.
 We
 want
 peace
 to
 prevent


that.


You
 said
 that
 the
 war
 has
 come
 to
 an


end,
 Mustafa,
 but
 there
 are
 so
 many


details
 to
 be
 worked
 out
 yet.
 So,
 I'm


just
 wondering
 how
 confident
 and


optimistic
 you
 feel
 about
 that.


It's
 okay
 because
 the
 American
 President


Donald
 Trump
 said
 the
 war
 is
 over
 and


war
 is
 over.


Thank
 you
 very
 much
 everybody.


Meanwhile
 in
 Jerusalem,


this
 is
 not
 only
 the
 end
 of
 a
 war.
 This


is
 the
 end
 of
 a
 age
 of
 terror
 and
 death


and
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 age
 of
 faith


and
 hope
 and
 of
 God.


Trump
 brought
 his
 message
 of
 peace
 to


the
 Israeli
 parliament.


It's
 the
 start
 of
 a
 grand
 concord
 and


lasting
 harmony
 for
 Israel
 and
 all
 the


nations
 of
 what
 will
 soon
 be
 a
 truly


magnificent
 region.
 I
 believe
 that
 so


strongly.
 This
 is
 the
 historic
 dawn
 of
 a


new
 Middle
 East.


My
 colleague
 David
 Sanger
 is
 covering


Trump's
 trip
 to
 the
 Middle
 East.


David,
 you
 are
 in
 Jerusalem
 where


President
 Trump
 actually
 spoke
 to
 the


Israeli
 Parliament
 Kesset
 and
 you


watched
 the
 speech.
 It
 appeared
 to
 me


that
 he
 was
 clearly
 taking
 a
 victory


lap.
 And
 I'm
 curious
 what
 your
 takeaway


was.


He
 was
 taking
 an
 agilation
 lap.
 I
 mean,


when
 Air
 Force
 One
 came
 down
 over


Hostages
 Square,
 you
 heard
 people


yelling,
 "Trump,
 Trump!"
 And
 it
 kept
 up.


When
 he
 got
 to
 the
 Ness,
 the
 parliament,


almost
 every
 place
 he
 went
 from
 both
 the


Netanyahu
 government
 and
 even
 the


opposition,
 he
 was
 given
 the
 credit
 for


the
 final
 turn
 of
 the
 screw
 that
 got


Hamas
 to
 release
 the
 last
 hostages.
 And


tonight,
 as
 we
 speak,
 there
 are
 no


living
 hostages
 in
 Gaza.
 That's
 been
 the


first
 time
 in
 years,


right?


But
 what
 was
 really
 interesting
 today


though,
 Rachel,
 was
 Trump's
 message.
 He


said
 explicitly,
 as
 far
 as
 I'm


concerned,
 the
 war
 is
 over.
 You
 didn't


hear
 that
 from
 BB
 Netanyahu,
 the
 prime


minister.


That
 contrast
 really
 struck
 me.
 Trump


seems
 like
 he's
 projecting
 this
 idea


that
 he
 has
 made
 peace,
 but
 Netanyahu


has
 been
 really
 much
 more
 circumspect
 on


where
 we
 are
 in
 the
 peace
 process.
 He


has
 not
 committed
 to
 the
 war
 being
 over.


That's
 exactly
 right,
 Rachel.
 And
 the


reason
 is
 simple.
 President
 Trump
 turned


out
 a
 20point
 plan,
 then
 twisted


Netanyahu's
 arm
 to
 get
 him
 to
 sign
 onto


it.
 Netanyahu
 did
 on
 the
 assumption
 not


incorrect
 that
 there
 were
 things
 in


there
 Hamas
 couldn't
 agree
 to
 starting


with
 the
 fact
 that
 Hamas
 would
 have
 to


disarm
 long
 one
 of
 Netanyahu's
 demands


and
 move
 out
 of
 Gaza
 and
 give
 up
 any


rights
 or
 thought
 of
 controlling
 it.
 So


when
 Hamas
 came
 back,
 they
 agreed
 to


part
 one,
 which
 was
 the
 hostage
 release


in
 return
 for
 getting
 hundreds
 of


Palestinian
 prisoners
 out
 of
 Israeli


jails.
 But
 they
 said
 they
 would
 have
 to


go
 negotiate
 on
 the
 remaining
 issues,


including
 disarming.


And
 President
 Trump
 just
 took
 a
 partial


yes
 as
 an
 answer,
 and
 said
 that


constitutes
 a
 peace
 agreement,
 which
 it


didn't.
 He
 didn't
 seem
 to
 say
 much
 about


the
 future
 of
 Gaza
 though,
 did
 he?


You
 know,
 Rachel,
 that
 was
 the
 big


missing
 element
 of
 the
 speech.
 And
 the


speech
 went
 on
 for
 more
 than
 an
 hour.
 He


went
 way
 off
 script.
 He
 told
 stories


about
 Steve
 Wickoff
 meeting
 Vladimir


Putin,
 which
 had
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 the


Middle
 East.
 He
 told
 stories
 about
 his


son-in-law,
 Jared
 Kushner,
 who
 was


there,
 who
 played
 a
 big
 role
 in
 this.


But
 what
 he
 didn't
 do
 was
 talk
 to
 the


Israeli
 Parliament
 about
 what
 they


needed
 to
 do
 next.
 He
 never
 mentioned
 a


two-state
 solution
 or
 an
 alternative
 to


a
 two-state
 solution.
 So
 he
 never
 talked


about
 the
 hard
 choices
 Israel
 would
 have


to
 make.
 He
 kept
 it
 all
 at
 the
 level
 of


kind
 of
 happy
 talk.


Now
 those
 details,
 Rachel,
 they
 were


supposed
 to
 be
 the
 next
 part
 of
 the


trip.
 He
 went
 to
 Charmeal
 Shake
 in
 Egypt


and
 met
 with
 nearly
 30
 world
 leaders.


They
 were
 supposed
 to
 make
 some


decisions
 about
 an
 international


stabilization
 force
 which
 would
 go
 in
 to


basically
 keep
 the
 peace
 in
 Gaza.
 They


were
 supposed
 to
 make
 some
 decisions


about
 who
 would
 pay
 to
 rebuild
 Gaza,


what
 it
 would
 look
 like,
 but
 Israel


wasn't
 there
 and
 Hamas
 wasn't
 there


and
 the
 meeting
 just
 wasn't
 long
 enough


to
 go
 into
 any
 depth
 about
 getting
 this


done
 in
 Gaza.


Do
 we
 have
 any
 indication
 about
 what


came
 out
 of
 that
 summit?


We
 don't
 know
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 details


now.
 We
 know
 they
 signed
 a
 document
 that


basically
 signed
 these
 countries
 up
 to


the
 president's
 20
 points,
 but
 you
 know,


this
 was
 very
 Donald
 Trump
 the


developer.
 I'm
 going
 to
 come
 in
 with
 a


big
 concept
 and
 then
 you
 people
 can
 go


off
 and
 work
 out
 the
 details.
 The


problem
 is
 in
 diplomacy,
 it
 frequently


doesn't
 work
 that
 way.
 And
 the
 big
 worry


that
 I
 have,
 Rachel,
 is
 that
 we've
 got


tremendous
 momentum
 now.
 This
 was
 an


incredibly
 emotional
 day.
 People
 around


the
 world
 were
 engaged.
 And
 the
 question


is,
 can
 you
 keep
 Donald
 Trump
 engaged


now
 that
 he
 declares
 that
 he
 has
 brought


about
 peace?
 And
 can
 you
 keep
 the
 rest


of
 the
 world
 engaged
 in
 the
 really
 hard,


detailed
 work
 of
 rebuilding
 Gaza?


David,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.


Thank
 you,
 Rachel.


Okay,
 here's
 Michael
 with
 the
 rest
 of


today's
 show.


From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Michael


Babaro.
 This
 is
 the
 daily.


It's
 day
 12
 of
 the
 government
 shutdown.


Now,
 President
 Trump
 is
 ordering
 mass


federal
 layoffs.
 In
 a
 court
 filing,
 the


budget
 office
 said
 more
 than
 4,000


employees
 across
 several
 agencies
 will


receive
 layoff
 notices.
 The
 shutdown
 of


the
 US
 government,
 for
 which
 there
 is
 no


end
 in
 sight,
 has
 given
 the
 Trump


administration
 an
 extraordinary
 amount


of
 power
 to
 remake
 and
 in
 some
 cases
 to


decimate
 dozens
 of
 agencies.
 The


departments
 of
 commerce,
 education,


homeland
 security,
 and
 the
 CDC
 are
 just


some
 of
 the
 agencies
 impacted.
 In
 many


ways,
 it's
 a
 power
 that
 the


administration
 learned
 how
 to
 wield


during
 two
 extraordinary
 weeks
 back
 in


January
 when
 it
 systematically
 destroyed


USID.


Today,
 Chris
 FL
 on
 what
 he
 learned
 from


reconstructing
 the
 death
 of
 that
 agency


from
 the
 inside.


It's
 Tuesday,
 October
 14th.


Chris,
 throughout
 the
 government


shutdown
 that's
 now
 entering
 its
 third


week,
 the
 threat
 that
 the
 Trump


administration
 has
 issued
 is
 that
 it


might
 use
 the
 shutdown
 as
 the
 rationale


to
 gut
 the
 federal
 bureaucracy,
 further


gut
 the
 federal
 bureaucracy.
 And
 you


have
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 trying
 to


reconstruct
 what
 I
 would
 argue
 is
 the


single
 greatest
 act
 of
 government


gutting
 by
 this
 White
 House
 since
 it


took
 back
 power
 in
 January.
 And
 so
 we


wondered
 what
 lessons
 you
 learned
 from


that
 reporting
 that
 might
 apply
 to
 this


moment
 to
 this
 shutdown.
 Yeah,
 the


moment
 feels
 like
 a
 lifetime
 ago,
 but


think
 back
 to
 the
 first
 few
 days
 of
 the


new
 Trump
 administration
 when,
 as
 you


said,
 they
 wiped
 out
 an
 entire


government
 agency,
 USAD,
 the
 agency
 for


international
 developments
 in
 a
 matter


of
 days.
 And
 it
 was
 so
 complete
 and
 so


sort
 of
 shocking
 at
 the
 time
 to


basically
 get
 rid
 of
 10,000
 federal


workers
 that
 I
 wanted
 to
 go
 back
 to
 it


and
 understand
 what
 happened
 and
 what


was
 the
 thinking
 behind
 it.
 What
 was
 the


strategy?
 And
 what
 I
 found
 out
 was
 there


wasn't
 in
 fact
 a
 plan
 to
 kill
 off
 USAD.


At least
 not
 at
 first.


It
 happened
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 the
 fly.


sort
 of
 a
 series
 of
 decisions
 and


clashes
 that
 built
 on
 each
 other
 to


advance
 an
 agenda
 that
 is
 ideologically


consistent
 but
 not
 it
 turned
 out
 all


that
 planned
 out.
 They
 were
 looking
 for


opportunities
 and
 willing
 to
 use
 them


really
 aggressively
 when
 they
 came
 up.
 H


it's
 interesting
 that
 you
 have
 found


that
 the
 obliteration
 of
 USA
 ID
 was


essentially
 improvised
 because
 right
 now


during
 this
 shutdown
 the
 threat
 of


traumas
 to
 the
 federal
 government
 like


what
 happened
 at
 USA
 ID
 feels
 quite


explicit.


That's
 exactly
 right.
 And
 I
 think
 the


reason
 the
 case
 study
 of
 USAD
 remains


really
 instructive
 today
 is
 it
 shows
 how


they
 were
 willing
 to
 improvise
 and
 how


effective
 that
 could
 be.
 And
 I
 think


that
 applies
 in
 an
 important
 way
 to
 the


shutdown
 where
 it
 tells
 us
 maybe
 the


outcome
 of
 the
 shutdown
 will
 not
 be


dictated
 just
 by
 what
 is
 strictly
 legal


but
 also
 outcomes
 that
 we
 couldn't
 have


imagined
 when
 it
 began.
 Well,
 Chris,


take
 us
 inside
 the
 story
 that
 you
 have


pieced
 together
 of
 this
 two
 weeks
 during


which
 USAD
 went
 from
 a
 fully
 functioning


agency
 to
 ultimately
 vanishing.
 Yeah,


it's
 really
 the
 story
 of
 just
 a
 few
 key


characters.
 Let's
 start
 with
 a
 man
 named


Jason
 Gray.


Longtime
 federal
 civil
 servant,
 worked


at
 a
 number
 of
 big
 agencies.
 Crucially,


had
 only
 been
 at
 aid
 for
 about
 2
 years


when
 he
 was
 picked
 at
 the
 very
 beginning


of
 this
 administration,
 almost
 without


warning,
 to
 be
 in
 charge
 of
 USAD.
 Now,


the
 fact
 that
 Jason
 Gray
 didn't
 have
 the


kind
 of
 experience
 someone
 would
 usually


have
 to
 run
 an
 agency
 like
 USAD
 became


important
 when
 on
 that
 very
 same
 day,
 on


the
 first
 day
 in
 office,
 Donald
 Trump


signed
 an
 executive
 order
 freezing


foreign
 aid.
 That
 order
 wasn't


surprising.
 He
 it
 indicated
 he
 would
 do


something
 similar,
 but
 something
 about


that
 order
 turned
 to
 be
 really


important.
 It
 was
 actually
 unclear
 what


it
 meant.
 M
 the
 order
 confusingly
 said


that
 the
 government
 would
 quote


immediately
 pause
 new
 obligations
 and


dispersements
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 money


that
 was
 flowing
 at
 USA
 ID
 was
 for


projects
 around
 the
 world
 already
 in


existence
 so
 that
 left
 open
 the
 question


well
 what
 happens
 to
 those
 should
 those


stop
 as
 well
 the
 people
 I
 spoke
 with


said
 the
 idea
 that
 President
 Trump
 would


stop
 existing
 programs
 which
 is
 sort
 of


a
 little
 crazy
 right
 probably
 illegal
 so


they
 didn't
 even
 think
 That
 would
 be


what
 it
 was,


right?
 And
 I'm
 not
 a
 lawyer,
 but
 hearing


the
 language
 from
 this
 executive
 order,


pause
 new
 obligations
 certainly
 sounds


like
 pause
 new
 spending,
 not
 old


spending.


That's
 exactly
 right.
 And
 in
 fact,
 it


seemed
 so
 obvious
 to
 the
 people
 inside


USAD
 that
 they
 didn't
 give
 much
 thought.


And
 the
 result
 was
 most
 programs
 just


kept
 continuing
 as
 they
 were.
 But
 this


is
 where
 we
 introduce
 our
 second
 main


character.
 Pete
 Morocco
 was
 a
 key
 figure


in
 the
 first
 Trump
 administration.
 He


had
 a
 stint
 actually
 at
 USAD
 in
 the


closing
 months
 of
 that
 administration.


Was
 remembered
 as
 being
 very
 hard


charging,
 very
 aggressive,
 being
 very


eager,
 I'm
 told,
 to
 enforce
 President


Trump's
 agenda
 and
 left
 people
 a
 little


unhappy.
 He
 eventually
 left
 after
 just
 a


few
 months
 at
 USAD.
 Well,
 Pete
 Morocco


suddenly
 re-emerges
 in
 the
 early
 days
 of


the
 second
 Trump
 administration
 because


he
 has
 a
 senior
 role
 at
 the
 State


Department
 where
 as
 director
 of
 foreign


assistance,
 he
 has
 some
 authority
 over


USAD.
 And
 all
 of
 a
 sudden,
 just
 a
 few


days
 into
 this
 new
 administration,
 he


calls
 senior
 staff
 at
 USAD.
 He
 says,


"Hey,
 it's
 come
 to
 my
 attention
 that
 AID


is
 still
 spending
 money
 in
 violation
 of


this
 executive
 order.
 This
 is
 a
 real


problem."
 And
 he
 said
 he
 wanted
 to
 get


to
 the
 bottom
 of
 it.


Okay.
 So,
 suddenly
 you
 have
 a
 clashing


view
 of
 what
 this
 executive
 order
 says.


You
 got
 the
 newbie
 head
 of
 the
 agency
 a


little
 out
 of
 his
 depth
 seeing
 the


language
 of
 the
 order
 and
 saying,
 "I'm


all
 good."
 You
 got
 the
 old
 line
 hard


charging
 Trump
 figure
 coming
 in
 and


saying
 you're
 totally
 wrong
 here.
 All


spending
 is
 now
 done.
 That's
 right.
 So,


here
 we
 are.
 This
 is
 just
 like
 4
 days
 in


to
 the
 new
 administration.
 Senior


officials
 at
 the
 top
 of
 USAD
 gather
 for


a
 meeting
 in
 the
 agency's
 headquarters


just
 a
 few
 blocks
 from
 the
 White
 House


and
 they
 said,
 "No,
 you
 know what?
 We've


looked
 at
 this.
 We
 think
 this
 is
 all


above
 board.
 the
 way
 we
 spend
 money
 can


be
 complicated.
 Perhaps
 they
 said
 to


themselves,
 Pete
 Morocco
 just
 maybe


doesn't
 understand
 the
 way
 money
 flows


from
 USA
 ID.
 We
 can
 fix
 this.
 And
 so
 the


plan
 they
 left
 that
 meeting
 with
 was


we'll
 explain
 ourselves
 to
 Pete
 Morocco


and
 this
 should
 be
 fine,


right?
 Problem
 solved.


And
 of
 course
 that's
 not
 what
 happened.


The
 following
 Monday,
 this
 is
 one
 week


into
 the
 new
 administration.
 Pete


Morocco
 for
 the
 first
 time
 shows
 up
 at


the
 USAD
 headquarters
 and
 he
 says
 he's


there
 because
 he
 wants
 to
 keep
 on


digging.
 He's
 not
 convinced
 this
 problem


is
 fixed.
 And
 crucially,
 he's
 not
 alone.


He
 brings
 with
 him
 members
 of
 the


Department
 of
 Government
 Efficiency.
 And


he
 says
 they're
 there
 to
 help
 him
 figure


out
 what
 went
 wrong.
 And
 I
 think
 people


at
 this
 point
 as
 we
 speak
 today
 know
 all


about
 Doge,
 right?
 Doge
 is
 under
 Elon


Musk
 and
 went
 around
 looking
 for
 severe


cuts
 and
 for
 ways
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 staff.


But
 this
 is
 just
 one
 week
 in.
 People


don't
 yet
 know
 at
 this
 point
 what
 Doge


is
 all
 about.
 They
 didn't
 yet
 realize


just
 how
 serious
 it
 was
 for
 Doge
 to
 be


in
 the
 building.
 In
 fact,
 this
 is
 one
 of


the
 first
 agencies
 that
 Doge
 went
 to.


Mhm.
 It
 was
 only
 later
 that
 day
 that


people
 began
 to
 realize
 what
 Doge
 was


there
 to
 do
 because
 that
 afternoon,


senior
 figures
 from
 Doge
 made
 a
 demand.


They
 went
 into
 Jason
 Gay's
 office
 with
 a


list
 of
 57
 senior
 officials
 at
 USAD
 and


said,
 "We've
 done
 some
 digging.
 We
 think


these
 57
 people
 were
 involved
 in
 these


payments.
 We
 want
 them
 put
 on


administrative
 leave
 and
 sent
 home."
 So


suddenly
 Doge
 is
 operating
 as
 kind
 of
 a


search
 and
 destroy
 operation
 to
 find
 the


culprits
 for
 who
 has
 allowed
 spending
 to


occur
 in
 violation
 of
 this
 executive


order.
 They're
 kind
 of
 the
 enforcement


arm
 of
 the
 Trump
 administration
 coming


in
 to
 settle
 that
 matter.
 That's
 right.


But
 though
 that's
 the
 story
 they
 gave,


the
 people
 I
 spoke
 with
 said
 it
 didn't


really
 hold
 up.
 Hm.
 Because
 these
 57


names
 weren't
 on
 closer
 inspection


people
 who
 were
 likely
 to
 have
 had


anything
 to
 do
 with
 these
 payments.
 This


list
 of
 names
 was
 something
 quite


different.
 It
 was
 really
 the
 senior
 most


people
 in
 leadership
 roles
 from
 around


the
 agency.
 And
 so
 what
 it
 came
 to
 look


like
 was
 an
 attempt
 to
 decapitate
 USAD.


Okay.
 So,
 as
 all
 these
 folks
 are


pursuing
 their
 own
 ends


and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 anger
 in
 the
 air


over
 the
 idea
 that
 rules
 are
 being


broken,


what
 happens
 next?


A
 few
 days
 later,
 Doge
 comes
 back
 and


presents
 to
 USA
 ID
 officials
 what
 they


call
 their
 evidence
 for
 why
 these
 57


people
 should
 not
 get
 to
 come
 back
 to


their
 jobs.
 The
 evidence
 turns
 out
 to
 be


painfully
 thin.
 It
 consists
 of
 an
 email


that
 one
 of
 the
 members
 of
 the
 Doge
 team


sent
 his
 teammates
 a
 few
 days
 earlier
 in


which
 he
 said,
 quote,
 "Look,
 I
 reviewed


these
 aid
 payments
 since
 the
 order."
 And


then
 he
 lists
 some
 people
 who
 had
 access


to
 the
 system.
 And
 then
 he
 goes
 on
 to


say,
 I
 could
 be
 wrong.


So
 this
 is
 not
 the
 evidence
 required
 to


end
 the
 career
 of
 57
 leaders
 at
 USAD.


That
 is
 the
 judgment
 of
 the


professionals
 inside
 USAD.
 in
 particular


a
 gentleman
 named
 Nicholas
 Gotautleb


whose
 role
 is
 to
 oversee
 employee
 and


labor
 relations
 at
 USAD.


So
 this
 Nick
 Gatota
 suddenly
 becomes


another
 player
 in
 this
 saga.


He
 looks
 at
 this
 evidence
 and
 he
 says
 no


I
 cannot
 agree
 to
 keep
 these
 senior


leaders
 on
 leave
 based
 on
 this.
 This
 is


not
 sufficient.
 And
 then
 Nick
 got


two
 things
 that
 prove
 to
 be
 tremendously


important
 to
 the
 future
 of
 USA
 ID.


First,
 he
 sends
 an
 email
 to
 those
 57


people
 saying,
 "Look,
 based
 on
 the


evidence,
 I've
 got
 no
 basis
 for
 keeping


you
 on
 leave."


But
 then,
 arguably
 more
 important,
 he


sends
 a
 memo
 to
 Jason
 Gray.
 He
 says
 he


will
 report
 DOA's
 actions
 to
 the
 Office


of
 Special
 Counsel,
 which
 investigates


wrongdoing
 and
 protects
 whistleblowers


and
 is
 meant
 to
 protect
 federal


employees.
 So,
 he
 threatens
 to
 begin


some
 sort
 of
 formal
 investigation
 of


what
 Doge
 has
 done.


Wow.
 So
 Nick
 Gotautle
 decides
 to
 stand


up
 and
 fight
 all
 this
 and
 ask
 for
 an


investigation
 into
 DOA's
 investigation


inside
 of
 USAD.


Yeah,
 it's
 really
 impossible
 to


overstate
 just
 what
 a
 big
 deal
 this
 was


in
 the
 eyes
 of
 Doge
 and
 Pete
 Morocco
 and


eventually
 the
 White
 House.


They
 viewed
 this
 as
 absolute


insubordination.
 Their
 view
 was,
 "How


dare
 this
 mid-level
 career
 federal
 civil


servant
 tell
 us
 what
 we
 can
 and
 cannot


do?"


This
 is
 the
 deep
 state
 personified.


This
 starts
 to
 look
 a
 lot
 like
 the
 deep


state
 and
 it
 set
 the
 tone
 for
 what


happened
 next.
 This
 is
 just
 10
 days
 in


to
 the
 new
 administration.
 So,
 right


away,
 they
 find
 Nick
 Gotautle
 and
 march


him
 out
 of
 the
 building.
 Wow.


But
 they
 don't
 stop
 there.
 They
 go
 to


Jason
 Gray
 and
 they
 say
 this
 action
 from


your
 employee
 from
 this
 Nick
 Gotle,
 it


shows
 that
 you've
 lost
 control
 of
 the


building.
 So
 they
 demanded
 that
 Jason


Gray
 try
 to
 regain
 control
 of
 the


building.
 And
 the
 way
 they
 wanted
 him
 to


do
 it
 was
 to
 lock
 out
 the
 entire
 staff


from
 their
 phone
 and
 email
 systems.


block
 out
 every
 single
 one
 of
 the


thousands
 of
 people
 who
 work
 at
 USAD


around
 the
 world
 from
 the
 technology


they
 use
 to
 work
 at
 USAD.
 That's
 right.


It's
 worth
 saying
 it's
 not
 clear
 how


wellthought
 out
 this
 idea
 was.
 I've


heard
 different
 versions
 of
 it.
 Someone


said
 not
 necessarily.
 They
 just
 wanted


to
 prepare
 a
 plan.
 They
 wanted
 the


option.
 But
 what
 Jason
 Gray
 heard
 by
 the


accounts
 of
 everyone
 I
 spoke
 with
 was


something
 that
 he
 viewed
 as
 too
 much.
 He


said,
 "We've
 got
 people
 in
 combat
 zones,


people
 delivering
 food
 in
 Gaza,
 people


fighting
 Ebola
 in
 Africa.
 I
 cannot
 lock


them
 out.
 That
 will
 put
 them
 in
 physical


danger.
 I
 won't
 do
 it."


People,
 he's
 really
 seeming
 to
 say,


could
 die.


That's
 right.
 He
 said
 people
 could
 die.


And
 that
 to
 him
 was
 the
 line
 he
 wouldn't


cross.
 And
 what
 that
 sounded
 like
 to
 the


administration
 was
 yet
 another
 example


of
 insubordination


from
 USAD.
 And
 within
 days,
 the
 agency


would
 effectively
 be
 shut
 down.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


So
 Chris,
 once
 Jason
 Gray,
 the
 head
 of


USA
 ID,
 the
 Trump
 appointed
 head
 of
 USA


ID,
 says
 you
 can't
 freeze
 every
 employee


out
 of
 their
 computer
 system,
 their


phone
 system.
 What
 comes
 next
 on
 this


journey
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 USA
 ID?


A
 lot
 of
 things
 happen
 really
 quickly.


One
 of
 them
 is
 as
 of
 the
 next
 morning,


Jason
 Gray
 has
 been
 removed
 from
 his


post
 as
 head
 of
 USAD.
 M
 and
 that's


really
 just
 the
 beginning.
 We're
 now


into
 the
 weekend.
 This
 is
 just
 the


second
 weekend.
 I
 cannot
 stress
 enough.


We
 are
 less
 than
 2
 weeks
 in,


right?


And
 this
 is
 when
 members
 of
 Doge
 begin


to
 go
 in
 and
 really
 aggressively
 begin


rooting
 through
 the
 files,
 turning
 off


social
 media,
 shutting
 down
 the
 website


of
 USA
 ID.
 Someone
 described
 it
 to
 me
 as


akin
 to
 the
 face
 of
 USA
 ID
 being
 erased.


So
 over
 this
 weekend,
 you
 can
 tell
 that


USA
 ID
 is
 in
 real
 trouble.
 At
 the
 same


time,
 thousands
 of
 staff
 members
 begin


losing
 access
 to
 their
 email
 accounts


and
 computer
 systems.
 So
 in
 the


background,
 the
 agency
 is
 starting
 to
 be


dismantled.
 But
 then
 it
 moves
 to
 the


foreground.
 This
 is
 Sunday
 afternoon.


We're
 about
 13
 days
 into
 the
 new


administration.
 What
 breaks
 out
 into
 the


public
 is
 a
 tweet
 from
 Elon
 Musk
 and
 he


writes,
 "USID
 is
 a
 criminal


organization.
 Time
 for
 it
 to
 die."


Not
 a
 lot
 of
 parsing
 to
 do
 of
 that


language.
 This
 is
 Elon
 Musk
 issuing
 a


kind
 of
 death
 sentence
 for
 this
 agency.


Yeah.
 And
 in
 hindsight,
 you
 know,
 it's


clear
 what
 that
 meant.
 But
 again,


remember
 at
 the
 time,
 this
 is
 also
 new.


People
 don't
 really
 know
 how
 much
 power


Doge
 has
 and
 they
 don't
 know
 how
 much


power
 Elon
 Musk
 has.
 Right?
 In
 theory,


if
 one
 is
 to
 stick
 to
 the
 law,
 Elon


Musk,
 who's
 not
 really
 a
 government


employee,
 certainly
 doesn't
 have
 the


authority
 to
 unilaterally
 end
 a


congressionallymandated


agency.
 So,
 this
 this
 tweet
 marks
 a


funny
 transition
 from
 a
 world
 where


those
 kinds
 of
 rules
 still
 matter
 to
 a


world
 where,
 oh,
 maybe
 Elon
 Musk
 and


Doge
 can
 just
 end
 US
 ID,


right?
 And
 the
 next
 day
 is
 when
 you
 can


really
 tell
 beyond
 a
 shadow
 of
 doubt
 USA


ID
 is
 not
 going
 to
 survive


because


because
 early
 on
 that
 day
 that
 Monday


two
 weeks
 in
 the
 administration
 is
 an


even
 more
 aggressive
 tweet
 from
 Elon


Musk
 and
 it
 reads
 we
 spent
 the
 weekend


feeding
 USA
 ID
 into
 the
 wood
 chipper


could
 gone
 to
 some
 great
 parties
 did


that
 instead.
 From
 there,
 staff
 who


worked
 in
 the
 Washington
 DC
 headquarters


were
 told
 to
 stay
 home.
 Later
 that
 day,


the
 State
 Department
 sent
 Congress
 a


letter
 saying
 they
 would
 move,


reorganize,
 or
 otherwise
 wind
 down
 USAD.


It
 even
 said,
 quote,
 "The
 remainder
 of


the
 agency
 may
 be
 abolished."


Chris,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 I


understand
 the
 sequence
 of
 what
 happened


here
 based
 on
 your
 investigation.
 We
 get


this
 pretty
 confusing
 executive
 order


and
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 at
 USA
 ID
 who


interpret
 it
 exactly
 as
 it's
 written
 and


that
 leaves
 folks
 like
 Pete
 Morocco


convinced
 that
 there's
 rampant


insubordination
 going
 on
 across
 the


agency.
 Doge
 comes
 in,
 starts
 punishing


people
 for
 being
 insubordinate,
 and


within
 a
 week
 or
 so,
 Doge
 is
 shutting


the
 whole
 place
 down.
 Is
 that
 more
 or


less
 right?


That
 is
 correct.
 And
 what
 it
 feels
 like


is
 revealed
 in
 your
 reporting
 is
 that


while
 an
 underlying
 ideology


might
 be
 behind
 the
 way
 the
 Trump


administration
 sees
 USA
 ID
 from
 the


beginning,
 right,
 which
 is
 America
 first


and
 foreign
 aid
 are
 not
 so
 compatible.


So
 USAD
 was
 always
 going
 to
 be
 suspect


to
 this
 administration.
 It
 feels
 like


the
 speed
 with
 which
 the
 agency
 just


evaporates


has
 a
 lot
 more
 to
 do
 with
 a
 few


individuals


becoming
 furious
 at
 what
 feels
 like
 a


very
 normal
 process
 of
 employees


engaging
 in
 a
 back
 and
 forth
 push
 and


pull
 around
 rules
 and
 process
 and
 the


reaction


being
 nuclear.
 You
 know
 this
 is


disobedience,
 this
 is
 resistance.
 we
 are


going
 to
 destroy
 your
 agency
 as
 a
 result


of
 it.
 And
 that
 all
 feels
 very
 outsized


given
 the
 facts
 that
 you
 found
 on
 the


ground.
 That's
 exactly
 right.
 And
 I


think
 you're
 you're
 landing
 on
 a
 really


important
 point,
 which
 is
 maybe
 those


two
 things
 aren't
 totally
 separate,


right?
 Maybe
 the
 style
 and
 substance
 of


government
 here
 affect
 each
 other,


right?
 The
 policy
 decisions
 that
 reflect


the
 ideology
 get
 influenced
 and


overtaken
 by
 sort
 of
 the
 style
 of


government,
 the
 combiveness,


the
 hostility
 towards
 career
 civil


servants,
 the
 suspicion
 of
 the
 deep


state
 and
 that
 sort
 of
 hostility
 uh
 and


animus
 comes
 to
 overtake
 or
 redirect
 the


policy
 goals.
 And
 those
 two
 things


rather
 than
 remaining
 separate
 become


sort
 of
 a
 cycle
 and
 they
 start


reinforcing
 each
 other
 leading
 to
 really


aggressive
 and
 fast
 outcomes
 that
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 just
 this
 short
 twoe
 period


probably
 would
 have
 been
 pretty
 hard
 to


predict
 because
 you
 had
 two
 combustible


elements
 interacting
 at
 the
 same
 time.


Right?
 But
 a
 clear
 lesson
 to
 have


emerged
 from
 this,
 and
 I
 know
 this
 is


complicated,
 is
 that
 the
 greater
 the


resistance
 from
 people
 inside
 of
 it
 to


what
 people
 from
 the
 administration


wanted,
 the
 greater
 the
 pain,
 the


trauma,
 and
 the
 gutting
 resulted.


I
 think
 that
 definitely
 describes
 what


happened
 at
 USAD.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 is
 in


fact
 the
 lesson
 that
 others
 took
 away


from
 from
 aid
 and
 from
 this
 early
 period


that
 it's
 easier
 not
 to
 fight.
 It's


easier
 just
 to
 give
 in.
 And
 we
 see
 that


in
 the
 behavior
 of
 some
 law
 firms
 of


some
 universities.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that


is
 though
 a
 general
 concept.
 Another


lesson
 might
 just
 be
 that
 USAD
 fought


back
 in
 the
 wrong
 way.
 They
 they
 thought


that
 just
 by
 appealing
 to
 the
 letter
 of


the
 law
 and
 to
 accepted
 HR
 practices,


they
 would
 be
 able
 to
 stop
 this


administration.
 They
 probably


underestimated
 the
 degree
 to
 which


officials
 would
 feel
 sort
 of
 personally


chagrined
 when
 they
 said
 no
 to
 their


demands.
 So
 the
 lesson
 of
 USAD
 to
 my


mind
 is


the
 the
 steps
 the
 Trump
 administration


will
 take
 to
 try
 to
 shut
 down
 an
 agency.


The
 steps
 they'll
 take
 in
 response
 to


what
 they
 perceive
 as
 insubordination.


They're
 unexpected
 and
 they
 can
 seem


really
 extreme.
 and
 USAD
 wasn't
 ready


for
 it.
 But
 as
 you
 apply
 that
 lesson
 to


the
 shutdown,


I
 wonder
 if
 what
 we
 see
 is


this
 is
 not
 a
 saga.
 This
 is
 not
 a
 battle


that
 unfolds
 along
 lines
 that
 make
 any


sense.
 This
 is
 not
 administration
 that's


following
 a
 particular
 strategy,


but
 instead
 they're
 reacting.
 They're


looking
 for
 openings.
 They're


aggressively
 pushing
 those
 openings.
 and


they've
 learned
 a
 different
 but
 maybe


more
 important
 lesson
 from
 USAD.
 And


that
 lesson
 is
 they
 can
 get
 away
 with


things
 like
 this.
 The
 consequences


don't
 always
 materialize.
 In
 other


words,
 if
 the
 Trump
 administration


decides
 that
 the
 shutdown
 is
 licensed
 to


go
 into
 an
 agency
 it
 doesn't
 like
 or


wants
 to
 severely
 reduce.


What
 the
 lesson
 of
 this
 all
 is
 for
 the


Trump
 administration
 is
 they
 can


probably
 do
 what
 they
 want
 and
 that
 was


true
 before
 the
 shutdown
 perhaps
 is
 even


truer
 now
 that
 the
 government
 is
 in


shutdown
 because
 it's
 concentrated
 the


president's
 authority
 over
 funding
 and


once
 they
 make
 a
 decision
 to
 go
 into
 an


agency
 any
 decision
 as
 we've
 talked


about
 any
 resistance
 could
 then
 be
 used


to
 very
 unpredictably


take
 something
 that
 seems
 small
 and
 turn


it
 into
 something
 very
 big
 and
 use
 it
 as


a
 rationale
 to
 transform
 maybe
 even
 end


an
 agency.


Exactly.
 One
 of
 the
 unexpected


conversations
 that's
 emerged
 from
 the


shutdown
 is
 even
 the
 Trump


administration
 needing
 to
 grapple
 with


is
 the
 government
 important.
 And
 the


reality
 of
 the
 USAD
 is
 that
 since
 it


happened
 so
 early,
 we
 now
 have
 had
 the


longest
 time
 to
 think
 about
 the


repercussions
 of
 it
 going
 away.
 And
 I


think
 we'd
 be
 remiss
 if
 we
 didn't
 for
 a


moment
 talk
 about
 what
 it
 has
 meant
 to


the
 world
 that
 USAD
 is
 now
 gone.
 Yeah.


This
 it
 what
 it
 looks
 like
 in
 real
 life


is
 people
 not
 getting
 HIV
 medication.
 Uh


mothers
 not
 getting
 life-saving
 care.


Starving
 children
 not
 getting
 emergency


nutrition
 packets.
 Countries
 that
 used


to
 get
 political
 assistance
 to
 remain


democracies
 is
 not
 getting
 that
 help.


Infrastructure
 that
 used
 to
 get
 built


for
 drinking
 water
 and
 sewage
 and


electricity
 and
 schools
 not
 being
 built.


uh
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 opposite
 of


progress
 all
 over
 the
 world
 and
 it's


it's
 already
 happening


right
 and
 that
 is
 no
 doubt
 of
 enormous


importance
 to
 the
 countries
 where
 USAD


was
 doing
 that
 work
 to
 the
 people
 doing


that
 work
 foreign
 policy
 experts
 would


tell
 you
 that
 over
 time
 this
 meant
 a
 lot


to
 America's
 ability
 to
 exercise
 soft


power
 and
 influence
 around
 the
 world


but
 at
 the
 same
 time


if
 You
 go
 walk
 the
 streets
 of
 the
 United


States
 and
 ask
 people
 do
 they
 miss
 US
 ID


and
 the
 work
 that
 it
 does
 and
 people
 are


being
 honest.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 the
 answer
 is


going
 to
 be
 we
 miss
 USA
 ID.
 I
 think
 the


answer
 is
 probably
 what
 was
 USA
 ID


again.


And
 that
 might
 be
 the
 most
 striking


lesson
 of
 all.


It
 showed
 the
 genius
 of
 Trump
 to


recognize,
 maybe
 not
 part
 of
 a
 plan,


maybe
 out
 of
 emotional
 spite,
 but


ultimately
 to
 recognize
 that
 he
 could
 do


what
 almost
 no
 president
 has
 done
 and


end
 a
 major
 agency
 and
 gamble
 that
 it


wouldn't
 cost
 him
 any
 meaningful


blowback
 from
 the
 public.
 And
 as
 of
 now,


it
 looks
 like
 he
 was
 right.
 H
 looks
 like


that
 gamble
 paid
 off.
 Which
 raises
 the


question
 in
 this
 shutdown.
 Well,
 if
 it


worked
 at
 USA
 ID,
 maybe
 he'll
 try
 it
 at


other
 agencies.
 Maybe
 when
 he
 threatens


to
 close
 quote
 Democrat
 agencies,
 maybe


he'll
 do
 it.
 And
 maybe
 it'll
 work
 out


for
 him
 again
 just
 like
 it
 did
 at
 USA


ID.


Well,
 Chris,
 thank
 you
 very
 much.
 We


appreciate
 it.


Great
 to
 be
 with
 you.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know.


today.


On
 Monday,
 Republican
 state
 lawmakers
 in


North
 Carolina
 said
 that
 they
 would
 soon


begin
 to
 redraw
 the
 state's


congressional
 maps
 to
 assure
 another


Republican
 seat
 in
 the
 US
 House
 of


Representatives
 before
 next
 year's


midterm
 elections.
 The
 effort
 would
 make


North
 Carolina
 the
 latest
 state
 to


fulfill
 President
 Trump's
 goal
 of
 trying


to
 retain
 Republican
 control
 of
 the


House
 by
 gerrymandering
 congressional


districts
 rather
 than
 winning


competitive
 elections.


This
 summer,
 Republican
 lawmakers
 in


Texas
 redrrew
 their
 state's
 election


maps
 to
 create
 five
 new


Republicanfriendly
 House
 seats,
 while


Republicans
 in
 Missouri
 redrrew
 its
 maps


to
 create
 one
 more
 Republican
 seat.
