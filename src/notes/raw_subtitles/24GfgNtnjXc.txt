- [Child] Look at that!
So pretty!
- The other day my son asked me
why rainbows are curved.
 
And I could have given
him a simple explanation
but instead I made this video.
 
With beautiful demonstrations
I've never seen before.
This is the perspective of a rainbow
from a single raindrop.
And the best animations ever created
on the subject.
Because I promise you, almost
every explanation out there,
double rainbow,
(intense music)
is an oversimplification.
For example, if raindrops
spread white light
into colors like a prism,
then why do you never see a rainbow
when looking in the direction of the sun?
Or why is it darker above
a rainbow than under it?
How can you make a rainbow
disappear with sunglasses?
What's going on here?
Why is this rainbow so
much smaller than usual?
And how did this phenomenon
directly lead to a Nobel Prize?
Oh yeah, we're going deep on this one
because the full explanation
is so much more satisfying
than anything you've seen before.
(rain splattering)
To make a rainbow, you need three things,
raindrops, the sun and you, an observer.
Okay, this is one of those
experiments that seems so simple,
but I've never seen anyone do it before.
I have a glass sphere and
that represents my raindrop
because as we've learned
in previous videos,
raindrops, of course, are
essentially spherically shaped.
(air whooshing)
Just preparing the particulate
so that I can see the laser beams.
Over here I have a laser.
And that laser beam
represents a ray from the sun.
Rays of light from the sun
reach a raindrop essentially
parallel to each other
because the sun is so far away.
When light strikes the sphere,
some of it reflects back
off the front surface
and some is transmitted into the sphere.
Then at the back,
again, some of the light
reflects off the back surface
and some is transmitted.
Every time light goes from
one medium into another,
some of it will be reflected
and some transmitted.
And exactly how much depends
on the angle of the light,
its polarization and the
nature of the two media.
This is actually helpful here
because I can use the reflections
to make sure the laser
is lined up properly.
I think I've got this red laser lined up,
so it's hitting the middle of the sphere
and it's reflecting here,
but some of the light goes through
and some of the light
reflects at the back surface,
and then some of the light
goes through for the wall.
Now I'm going to keep the laser horizontal
and move it up the sphere.
So let's call the distance
from the central axis,
the impact parameter.
(rhythmic music)
As I move the laser up,
the reflection off the
front surface goes up.
It's just bouncing off that curve surface.
And I can tell you,
this is a simple, boring reflection.
Nothing interesting happens with it.
It's not involved in
rainbows, so it's there,
but we're basically going to ignore it
for the rest of the video.
What's much more interesting
is the reflection
off the back surface.
Now here comes that ray here,
this spot is on the table.
As the laser moves up, it goes down.
In fact, the whole beam
inside the sphere bends down.
That's because as the
light enters the sphere,
it slows down, and so it refracts.
But why does light slow
down when it enters
a dense medium like glass?
Well, I think a lot of people can tell you
that light is an electromagnetic wave
without really thinking
about what that means.
You know the electric field
around a charged balloon
that pulls on your hair or
makes it stick to a wall
and the magnetic field around a bar magnet
that makes iron filings line up?
Well, light is what happens
if you could rip the electric
field off the charges,
the magnetic field off the
magnet, smoosh them together,
and send them out traveling
through space, sort of.
I mean in practice,
electromagnetic waves are made
by accelerating charges like
by wiggling them up and down.
Then the changing electric and
magnetic fields, they create,
team up as light
and head off on their own.
The clearest explanation I know of
for how light is slowed down
in a medium comes from
Grant over at 3Blue1Brown.
I asked him if I could
summarize his explanation
for this video and he graciously agreed.
So when those electromagnetic
waves encounter charges
in a medium like those in the
first layer of our sphere,
the light pushes them back and forth.
You can think of each charge
as a little mass on a spring
and the changing electric
and magnetic fields cause it
to vibrate at the same
frequency as the light.
But now you have wiggling
that is accelerating charges.
So they too must create their
own electromagnetic waves.
And the net electromagnetic
field is just a sum
of the incident wave plus this new wave.
The result is almost exactly
like the original wave,
except it has shifted back slightly.
It receives a phase kick
and each layer of the material
adds another phase kick.
So the net effect of all
this is the wavelength
of the radiation decreases
in the new medium.
And since the frequency stays the same,
a shorter wavelength
decreases the speed of light
through the material.
The speed of light in a vacuum
divided by the speed of
light in a medium is called
the refractive index.
It's around 1.5 for
glass and 1.33 for water.
So when light enters a
new medium at an angle,
the part of the wave crest that
enter the new medium first,
slow down first.
And this changes the angle
of all the wave crests.
And since the direction of a
beam of light is perpendicular
to the wave crests, this means
the light changes direction.
So to recap, light
causes charges to wiggle,
so they create their own
electromagnetic wave,
which gives the light a phase
kick shortening its wavelength
which slows it down and so it bends.
There's a simple mathematical expression
that relates the angles of
incidence and refraction
to the indexes of
refraction of the two media.
It's known as Snell's law,
even though it was
independently discovered
by a handful of people,
some well before Snell.
(intense music)
And this is what we're
seeing in the sphere.
The higher the laser hits the sphere,
the larger the angle of incidence
and hence the more it bends
down due to refraction.
Most of this light exits
out the back of the sphere
but some of it is reflected.
And it's this reflected ray
that we can see coming out
the front of the sphere
below the incident beam.
Now I wanna graph the
angle of this reflected ray
as I move the beam up the sphere.
When the laser is dead center,
the reflected beam comes
straight back at the source.
So let's call that 0 degrees.
Then as I move the laser
up, this angle increases.
So the light's coming back at
5 degrees, then 10 degrees,
and it keeps increasing the higher I go.
But now we come to the critical point.
Watch this spot on the table.
As I move the incident beam
up, this dot is moving in.
The reflected ray is coming
closer and closer and closer.
But there's a certain point right there
where it stops coming closer.
Look at that.
And even as I keep moving
this beam higher and higher,
it doesn't get any closer.
(intense music)
And then it goes back the other way.
So what we're seeing
there is a maximum angle
this reflected ray reaches
before it turns around
and goes back the other way.
(intense music)
And this is really important.
It means that over a range
of impact parameters,
a range of heights of the laser,
the reflected beam comes out
at essentially the same angle,
which means the light
is becoming concentrated
at that angle.
And a concentration of light
rays is called a caustic.
Curved surfaces all
tend to create caustics,
from coffee mugs to glasses
or even just rippling water.
Caustics create the light patterns we see
by concentrating light rays.
In the case of red light
through a sphere of water,
the maximum scattering angle,
and hence this caustic
always occurs at 42 degrees
below the horizontal.
Since my sphere is made of
glass rather than water,
well, the angle is different,
but the principle is the same.
Now you might ask, why does
this reflected ray reach
a maximum angle and then turn around?
Well, the answer is just geometry.
As I move the laser up the sphere,
although the ray refracts down,
the point on the back of the sphere
where it reflects continues to move up
until you get to this special point,
which is about 7/8 the
radius of the sphere.
And here, the angle of
incidence is so steep
that the refracted ray stops
hitting the back higher
and starts hitting it lower.
That is why the reflection turns around
and therefore we get a
maximum scattering angle
and the concentration of
light rays at that angle.
But the precise maximum
scattering angle depends
on the color of light.
To see why, let's go back
to the idea of the charges
in the sphere as masses on springs.
They have a natural frequency,
a frequency at which they would oscillate
if not driven at any particular frequency.
And in most materials,
this natural frequency is pretty high,
much higher than the
frequencies of visible light.
Now, when light pushes
a charge back and forth,
the amplitude of the
resulting vibration depends
on the difference between
the frequency of light
and the natural frequency of the charge.
The closer the two frequencies are,
the greater the amplitude
of the resulting vibration,
which makes sense if you've
ever pushed someone on a swing.
The closer your pushing frequency is
to the natural frequency of the swing,
the higher they'll go.
This means that higher
frequency light like blue light
will cause the charges to
wiggle with greater amplitude.
And because of this, the charges produce
higher amplitude
electromagnetic radiation,
which creates a bigger phase kick,
which shortens the wavelength
proportionally more,
making higher frequency
light travel slower
and bend more than lower frequency light.
All right, I'm gonna change lasers.
So when I repeated the
experiment with green light,
it refracted more than red light
and therefore the green
dot turned around sooner
than the red dot.
Whoa, oh,
there's the minimum deflection for green
and it's significantly
different than for red.
In other words, its maximum
scattering angle was smaller
than for red light.
If the sphere were water,
it would occur at around 41
degrees below the horizontal.
Similarly, for blue light,
the maximum scattering
angle approaches 40 degrees.
I do have a specialty laser,
which is very bright blue,
but it's very dangerous
so we're gonna use it very carefully.
how are we gonna use it
very carefully, Derek?
(tool thuds)
That is a good question.
(tape ripping)
Maybe we're just gonna tape it on here.
Yeah.
(playful music)
So the blue only makes it to
there, green here, red to here.
So it is a pretty serious spread here.
I think my experiment may
be a little wonky honestly,
I think this one wasn't
perfectly horizontal.
To really see the
importance of the caustic,
imagine we illuminate the
sphere uniformly with red light.
Well, more light is
going to hit the sphere
at higher impact parameters
because the further out you go,
the more area there is.
So I've adjusted these sections
so that they all have the same area.
Then using our graph of
the scattering angle,
you can see where all of
this red light will end up
after reflecting off the back surface.
Most of it ends up at the
maximum scattering angle.
To make this more obvious,
we can add more light
and we can do the same
thing for orange and yellow
and all of the other colors.
And this is what gives us the rainbow.
(soft choral music)
It's not enough to say that a
raindrop spreads white light
into its component colors
because all of the light that hits closer
to the middle is spread too.
But since the reflections
all overlap as they come out,
the colors mix and produce white again.
It's only the difference in
maximum scattering angles
and the caustics they produce
that gives us the rainbow.
(soft music)
So now we know what happens
along a single radius
of the sphere.
So what happens if we uniformly illuminate
the whole sphere with white light?
(bright music)
Well, I blacked out my window
and cut a hole just big
enough for afternoon sunlight
to cover the sphere.
You can see there's a circle
of white light coming from the reflections
off the back of the sphere,
and then around it, there's
a ring of rainbow colors.
Come on.
One raindrop creates a cone of light.
The inside is all white,
and the ring around
the outside is colored.
This is the perspective of a
rainbow from a single raindrop.
All these different light rays coming in
at different places reflect
back off the front surface
and the back surface,
that reflection off the
back surface reaches
a maximum angle.
And for blue, green, yellow, and red,
the maximum angle is different.
So the red maximum angle is the furthest.
That's why it's on the outside here.
So good, so good.
(light music)
What I really wanted to see
is if I could observe the cone
of different colored caustics
that produced that ring.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,
ho, ho, ho, ho.
You've got to see this color cone.
You have got to see this.
My eye is right in the color cone here,
I can see the color cone.
That is so cool.
(intense music)
So this is the crazy focus
on the back of the sphere.
If you stick your finger in
there, it gets burnt very quick.
Ow!
That thing is a focal.
(intense music)
Now this really looks like a rainbow,
but remember, this is
just the light coming away
from a single droplet.
When you see a rainbow, there
are billions of raindrops,
and each one is projecting a rainbow cone
back toward the sun.
So how does all of this create
a single unified rainbow?
Well, for your eye to see a color,
let's pick red in a
certain part of the sky,
then the red caustic from a
raindrop there must go directly
into your eye.
And this only happens when
the angle from the sun
to the raindrop to your eye is 42 degrees.
And this explains why rainbows
take the form of an arch
with a 42 degree angle.
(intense music)
Now, the violet light from these
same raindrops passes above
or beside your eye, so
you can't possibly see it.
But there are raindrops below
and inside the arc of
those red giving raindrops
whose violet caustics
do intersect your eye.
They form a shallower angle of 40 degrees
between the sun and your eye.
And of course, there are raindrops
at all intermediate angles that send you
all the other colors of the rainbow.
So a rainbow really is the
ultimate optical illusion
from billions of droplets each
projecting a rainbow cone.
You see a single static arch of color,
but the droplets sending you
those colors are constantly changing.
A single drop as it falls
might send to your eye
first red, then orange,
yellow, green, blue,
indigo, and violet.
(soft music)
And because a rainbow must form
an angle of 40 to 42 degrees
with your eye,
the center of the arch must be on a line
that passes from the sun
through the back of your head.
So your shadow is the
center of your rainbow.
This means no two people can ever see
the exact same rainbow.
In fact, your left and
right eyes don't even see
the same rainbow.
A rainbow is an optical
illusion made unique
for each perspective.
This also explains why in
most parts of the world,
you can only see a rainbow
in the early morning
or late afternoon, not
in the middle of the day.
The higher the sun is, the
lower the top of the rainbow is.
And when the sun is more than
42 degrees above the horizon,
no rainbow is visible from the ground.
(water splattering)
But even when rainbows are visible,
you can turn them
invisible using sunglasses
that is as long as they are polarized.
Light from the sun is unpolarized,
which means the electric fields
of the light are all randomly oriented,
oscillating back and forth
equally in all directions.
But it just so happens
that when the light in
the rainbow ray reflects
off the back of the droplet,
it does so very close
to a special angle known
as Brewster's angle.
At this angle,
all light with its electric
field oriented parallel
to the plane of reflection is transmitted.
So it passes out the back of the droplet,
and therefore the only light
that is reflected has its
electric field perpendicular
to the plane of reflection.
This is the light that
creates the rainbow.
This means rainbow light is
polarized along the direction
of the rainbow,
so horizontal at the top
and closer to vertical on the sides.
This is why you can
use a polarizing filter
to make a rainbow disappear
or to make it brighter
if you orient the filter
to allow that polarized
light to pass through.
But why is it brighter under
a rainbow than above it?
Well, this is because the raindrops
beneath the rainbow are
reflecting all colors
of light at you off their back surfaces.
This is what created the white disk
in my glass sphere experiment.
In contrast, the raindrops above the top
of the rainbow are not
reflecting any light to you
off their back surfaces.
Your eye is now outside the
maximum deflection angle
of all of the colors.
But if you look up even further,
sometimes you see a second fainter rainbow
with its colors inverted.
Double rainbow.
So where does this come from?
Well, it comes from an
additional reflection
inside the raindrops.
Now, instead of reflecting once
off the inside of the sphere,
light reflects twice.
These reflections also
create colored caustics,
though much fainter because light is lost
with each reflection.
If you look at deflection angles,
this light starts going out
the back of the raindrop.
So at an angle of 180 degrees,
but the further out light
hits from the center,
the smaller the angle
light reflects back at
until it reaches a minimum
of around 50 degrees
for red light.
Then it turns around and
goes back the other way.
So between 42 and 50 degrees,
it is dark because no light
reflected once or twice
inside a raindrop comes out at this angle.
This is known as Alexander's Dark Band.
Now, there is photographic evidence
of third and fourth order rainbows formed
after three or four internal reflections,
but this light comes out
the back of a raindrop.
So they are the only kinds of rainbows
that you could expect to see
when looking in the direction of the sun.
But they're so faint
that conditions would have to be perfect.
Under lab conditions,
up to 200th order rainbows
have been detected,
but that is not what is going on here.
This is known as a supernumerary rainbow.
Multiple rainbow like bands
show up under a primary rainbow,
but this only occurs
when the raindrops are all really small,
just 10ths of a millimeter in diameter.
Now, the light rays that
passed just above and below
the primary rainbow ray end up coming out
at similar angles under 40 degrees,
but they travel slightly
different distances
on the order of a wavelength.
And because of this, those
light rays can interfere
constructively and destructively,
producing a series of light
and dark bands inside the main rainbow.
Different colors in these
supernumerary rainbows overlap
more than in the main rainbow,
so they can produce strange
colors like magenta,
a combination of blue and red.
Supernumeraries also offer a clue
to how these small rainbows work.
Whenever I saw images like this
or even observed this sort
of thing from an airplane,
I wondered how a rainbow
could be so small.
(soft choral music)
These are known as
glories or Brocken bows.
Instead of the usual 42 degrees,
these circles of color are only around
two to four degrees wide.
Well, the key is that just
like in supernumeraries,
glories are due to interference.
So they too require tiny water droplets
just 10ths of a millimeter in diameter.
These are the sorts of droplets
you'd find in fog or clouds.
Light that strikes the edge
of the drop can go around the back
and come straight back at the source.
You can see that with the
laser on the glass sphere,
but effectively in the presence
of parallel light rays,
tiny little droplets become
a ring source of light.
But for these tiny droplets,
the distance from one point to all edges
of the sphere can vary on
the order of a wavelength.
So take for example,
the point right out in front of the drop.
Well, now the distance
to all edges is the same.
So the light interferes
constructively here
and produces a bright spot.
But a little bit off to one side
and now half of the light, on average,
has traveled an extra half a wavelength.
And so we get a dark spot here.
If you go a little further,
well now the light has traveled
an extra whole wavelength.
So now the light is
arriving in phase again,
and we get a bright spot here.
So we can rotate this around 360 degrees
and extend it out in all directions.
And what we get is a
fuzzy bullseye pattern.
And of course, all the different colors
of light have different wavelengths.
And so these
bullseye patterns aren't
completely overlapping.
So when they're superimposed,
what we see is rings of color.
Now, this is just the pattern
from a single droplet,
but just like with a rainbow,
if you have millions or
billions of these droplets,
they all contribute to
produce this same pattern
with your shadow at the center.
(soft music)
And it was just such a
pattern that inspired
a Nobel Prize winning discovery.
In September of 1894,
a scientist named CTR Wilson
was visiting an observatory
in the Scottish Hills.
It was then that he observed
"the coloured rings surrounding
the shadow cast on mist or cloud."
He recalls that these glories,
"greatly excited my interest
and made me wish to imitate
them in the laboratory."
So Wilson invented the cloud chamber
for the explicit purpose
of observing glories.
Of course, once he
discovered the cloud chamber,
made the tracks of
energetic particles visible,
he abandoned his original aim
and was later awarded the Nobel Prize.
But it all started with the
mystery of rings of color
in the fog.
- [Child] Wow.
Wow, looks so nice.
- How did you see that?
So now I hope you know my
son, why rainbows are curved,
and why they're polarized
and why they exist at all.
And even more than that,
I hope you know why I find such enjoyment
in learning about our world,
why it is worth figuring things out.
For millennia, rainbows have been this
blatant challenge held up to us by nature.
But can you figure this out?
And it's satisfying to say we have.
- [Child] I'm looking at a
different rainbow than you.
- It's true.
