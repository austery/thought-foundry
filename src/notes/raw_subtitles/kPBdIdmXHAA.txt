Hello everyone, I'm Anthony
Welcome to my channel
Today's video
I want to chat with you all
A common popular culture in East Asian society
It's a male versus a fighting girl
This kind of character and narrative fascination
By the way, I also want to discuss with you the aesthetics of white, thin and young
The reason why I want to talk about this topic
It started when I happened to be on station B
Saw a video of a steel coil girl generated by AI
The scene is usually set in a factory or construction site
The content is about a girl wearing a Japanese school uniform
Easily handle steel coils weighing several tons
Or lift the truck overhead
Even in a swimsuit
Standing in molten steel at a temperature of over a thousand degrees to make steel
The interaction in the comment section is also very interesting
Basically, it revolves around this purely fictional narrative
Make all kinds of imagination and reasoning
For example, "If you make her shy,
What would happen if I got slapped in the face?"
Some people also said, "This kind of girl's betrothal gift is 3 million.
I didn’t say a word.”
"Thousands of years later,
Alien archaeologists found
Evidence of human strength" and so on
We say
This kind of interaction between the comment section and the original author
It can also be regarded as a secondary creation behavior
Traditional literature or film and television works
Follow the author to the reader
One-way logic
The author has the right to interpret the work
Readers and viewers are to interpret the text
In contemporary ACGN culture
That is, in the culture of Japanese anime and novels
This kind of open narrative is quite common
Every audience member produces text
Project your emotions into it
in
Some texts will be popular because they fit the public sentiment
And quickly became famous
Becoming an Internet meme
The influence is even greater than the original
As a person who is very interested in various social phenomena
I thought this kind of video was very interesting.
So I collected them first.
After a few days
I happened to read the work of Japanese psychologist Saito Tamaki
Psychoanalysis of the Battle Girl
Suddenly, a lot of inspiration came
I think this kind of video
It can also be seen as a deformation of the aesthetic of the battle girl
That is, super-powered girl
Projecting desire on such girls
It is a cultural phenomenon with a very East Asian character.
So this video
Let’s talk about this topic in detail
Before the video starts, let me say
I will post this video
Put it in the list of "Psychology and Education"
if
Do you have any topics you want to discuss with me?
You can contact my email to make an appointment
So let's get back to today's topic
First, let’s say
The subject who projects sexual desire on the battle girl
即是所谓的御宅族お達人
The reason why we don't use the word otaku here is
Because
Although the Chinese word "otaku" also originated from Japanese
But in the Chinese context
Mainly refers to not liking to go out and socialize
The Japanese word おたく not only has this meaning
And more emphasis on love of anime,
Characteristics of subcultures such as gaming
Human sexual projection
It's a very natural and normal thing
but
Battle Girl is a special kind of sexual object
In Japanese anime works
Young women with strong fighting power often appear
They are either armed with weapons
Or have good kung fu
Or some kind of magic
In this sense
Steel Coil Girl
Of course, it is also a kind of transformation of the fighting girl
However
Their image is always pure, weak and sweet.
This is in stark contrast to their super powers.
For example, the steel coil girl always wears school uniform
Slim figure and youthful face
This means they are weak and need to be protected.
Yet they can lift steel coils with their bare hands.
This is generally considered a rather masculine
Even mechanized power
And when they do this
Still maintaining a relaxed and innocent expression
This suggests that this superpower is for them
It's some kind of innate talent
Rather than the result of hard training
This greatly eliminates
The aggressiveness and oppression brought by superpowers themselves
Make it fantastical, safe and harmless
but
The most important feature is
They are all completely fictional anime characters
It is also impossible to have real contact
So
Why do otakus like this imaginary character?
Pour your sexual desire
One obvious reason is
Japanese animation industry
Intentionally or unintentionally created the symbol of "Battle Girl"
And in decades of evolution
It is related to individual sexual desire, redemption fantasy,
Complex psychological factors such as anxiety compensation are related
1966
The TV animation "Magical Girl Sally" premiered in Japan
The show was influenced by the American TV series "Bewitched"
Just the role of the female lead in the original play
Became a girl
The Japanese adaptation deliberately emphasizes youth
This drama can be regarded as the beginning of the magical girl genre.
Then Hayao Miyazaki, Osamu Tezuka and other animation masters
Created many classic Sailor Moon characters
By the 1970s
This theme has more direct sexual descriptions
For example, in Nagai Go's 1973 work "Cutie Honey"
When the heroine transforms, she will appear naked
The popularization and promotion of home videotapes in the 1970s
This has greatly promoted the development of this subculture
In 1975, the TV animation "Red Flower Shadow" was first broadcast
The play tells the story of the French Revolution on the eve of
A masked knight
The story of fighting against the corrupt French court
And this masked knight is a girl
And one of the villains, Queen Mary
A strong and mature woman
In the theme of fighting beautiful girls
Immature girls equal kindness and justice
The logic that mature women equal evil
It is very common
Another typical case
It is Naoko Takeuchi's "Sailor Moon"
The heroine Usagi Tsukino
I am an ordinary girl who loves to cry
She accidentally rescued a mysterious cat
So she became the incarnation of the moon
Given super powers to save the Earth from the bad guys
In the animation
The scene where Usagi Tsukino transforms is also very unique
She chanted the spell and made a stroke with her right hand.
The scenery in front of me disappears in an instant
At a certain moment of transformation
There were nude scenes
Afterwards
She put on Sailor Moon's sailor uniform again
Usagi Tsukino and several other girls swore
Fight against evil forces to the end
This evil force is the Ice Queen
In Sailor Moon
Sexy and mature is almost equivalent to evil
The one who saves the world is an innocent and lovely girl
No need to give more examples
We can find
Japanese animation industry
Indeed, intentionally or unintentionally
Create such an image of a girl
In these works
The power of a girl
It is not a mature choice or awakening of will
It is often determined by "fate" and "props"
Or the result of some kind of innate power
They didn't actively strive for this power.
It is an externally assigned responsibility
This allows them to maintain their powerful
Can maintain a passive, ignorant and naive state
This is actually a culture that is quite Japanese.
As the author said
Battle Girls can only be born in Japanese space
There are also a large number of female warriors in Western works
However, these female warriors
They have an inner world and a history of spiritual development.
Like they've been through some kind of trauma.
Their strength often means overcoming and sublimating trauma.
This is a difficult thing to overcome.
The process of abandoning the old self and moving towards maturity
Even if there is a battle girl
So the fighting power of these girls
Often
At the expense of one's femininity
Rather than being like the Japanese fighting girls
Always remain pure, innocent and immature
This is also in line with reality
One person has such strong fighting power
Or the desire to fight
There must be some personal reason
Such as trauma, revenge, competitiveness, etc.
It is impossible to be in a completely undeveloped state of self-awareness
In the Japanese battle girl theme
The girls were deliberately stripped of their trauma
Even though they seem to have experienced some trauma in the play
But this trauma
It does not constitute the driving force of their personality development
They may have darkened due to some trauma
Or fall
but
In terms of the character's core state and mode of existence
Still repetitive and nonlinear
Even if the heroine seems to have solved some difficulties
or experienced emotional changes
These are often just
The fuel that keeps this cycle going
It did not bring about irreversible growth for the protagonist
In the end they will still return to that pure,
In the initial setting of kindness
This makes
Japan's fighting girls are always immature
Their adolescence is indefinitely extended
Their fighting motives remain unclear.
Or very simple
For example, saving humanity, for justice
To protect world peace, etc.
These are quite abstract and idealistic things
But we know
These abstract things
It is not enough to support a real person.
Because people’s behavior motivations in reality
Need to be based on individuality
That is, to be in harmony with one's own unique experiences, desires,
Experiences build deep connections
Otherwise, there will be no sustained action.
Can be for such
Completely abstract and empty slogans
To those who keep fighting
It can only be in a
A state of complete lack of self-awareness
But in reality
It is impossible for such a person to have powerful abilities.
This makes such a role
Appears hollow and lacks authenticity
But that’s exactly what the audience likes.
The inner world of the fighting girl is stripped away
This makes them what Lacan calls
The perfect carrier of small object a
If beautiful girls don't have real personalities
There is no unpredictability
No shortcomings
She is not herself
It is a background wall that can be projected by anyone.
Such a beautiful girl
Perfect match with the client
She has the superpower to solve all problems.
No aging
Will not betray
And possesses an uncivilized spirit of self-sacrifice
Her existence is to satisfy the subject's fantasy
Just immerse yourself in this fantasy
You don't have to face the reality of interacting with others
The complexity and pain that must be faced
But you can
Enjoy yourself in a safe and controllable virtual world
Experience the feeling of being loved and sexually projected
There are many such examples on the Chinese Internet.
For example, Doro, which was very popular some time ago
However
This kind of pleasure is ultimately unsustainable.
It's like a spinning top
Although individuals can
To continue to stimulate this pleasure
But this stimulation will eventually lead to a deeper emptiness
Although the other in reality is always unpredictable
However, the other is eliminated
Or
Treating fictional characters as complete extensions of yourself
In fact, the self is also eliminated.
Human subjectivity
It is precisely in the interaction and collision with others
Even established and confirmed in the struggle
An other who always says yes to you
It will eventually make your existence meaningless.
When I love someone
I must hope that the other person can love me freely
Instead of being forced to love me
But the other person has the freedom to love me
This means that she also has the freedom not to love me.
The human heart is the most unpredictable
This makes me loved
Fundamentally in a state of uncertainty
However
Love that can be completely certain is no longer love
A real person
Will surprise you with her independent will
Use her flaws to break your fantasy of perfection
This may be uncomfortable at the moment.
But it is this real intrusion
Only then can we break the closed loop of narcissism
Enable a person to adapt and grow
To create a common and unique story
This is any pre-scripted fantasy
Can't give
Of course we are here
This is not to deny the obsession with imaginary objects.
In my opinion
It's just a symptom.
Rather than the essence
I believe that friends who often watch our channel can feel
I have a lot of psychological phenomena
Such as self-deprecation, procrastination, addiction, etc.
It's never an advocacy
To directly criticize and eliminate symptoms
Focus on real issues beyond symptoms
As for the symptoms themselves
It has a certain purpose and function
It is often for the parties
Provides a stable psychological structure
Enables it to endure and defend against the pain of reality
As
We discussed gaming addiction in our April issue last year.
As mentioned in the video
Many parents and schools criticize the harm of online social networking
And believe that students only interact with others in school
To develop social skills
Online social interaction is indeed not as profound as real-life interpersonal support.
However, many schools in China
Does not provide truly effective interpersonal support
If a person in reality
Lack of good interpersonal support and close relationships
Then seek social support from the Internet
Better than nothing
Therefore, many so-called symptoms
It is very likely that the parties involved, under the current conditions
The least bad choice you can make
Also, I don’t think
A person who has overcome these symptoms
We must abandon ACGN culture
What really matters is his relationship to this culture
That is to say
ACGN is no longer a symptom he uses to escape reality
But become part of his creative life
For example
He is no longer just a passive consumer of content
Instead, start actively creating
He might become a fan artist.
A novelist
A game developer
A critic or blogger
He brings his unique passion and knowledge
It has become a way to communicate with others,
Practices that can intervene in the symbolic world
He no longer calls his "Second Dimension Wife"
As a perfect object that needs to be integrated
But
Think of her as a muse to inspire your creativity
That’s all for today’s video.
Next video
We will continue to explore the underlying reasons for this aesthetic
