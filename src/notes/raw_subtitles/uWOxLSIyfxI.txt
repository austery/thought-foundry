Hongi
 is
 a
 37year-old
 father
 of
 two


living
 in
 South
 Korea.
 After
 his
 second


child
 was
 born
 last
 year,
 he
 took
 6


months
 paid
 paternity
 leave
 to
 take
 care


of
 the
 kids


>> and
 to
 welcome
 his
 new
 baby.
 The
 company


also
 gave
 him
 $72,000,


no
 strings
 attached.
 Hungi
 says
 when
 he


got
 the
 news,
 he
 was
 so
 excited
 he


couldn't
 sleep.


>> And
 the
 good
 news
 didn't
 stop
 there.


Hungi
 and
 his
 wife
 learned
 his
 company


would
 give
 him
 another
 72,000


retroactively
 applied
 for
 their
 first


child
 who
 was
 born
 in
 2021.


Honki
 says
 thanks
 to
 that
 gift,
 he
 and


his
 wife
 have
 been
 able
 to
 move
 to
 a


bigger
 house.
 They're
 also
 thinking


about
 having
 a
 third
 child.


Hongi's
 company,
 a
 construction
 firm


called
 Buyong,
 is
 one
 of
 dozens
 of
 firms


in
 Korea
 offering
 financial
 incentives


to
 employees
 if
 they
 have
 babies.


Bloomberg's
 Hyong
 Hi
 Shin
 says
 these


companies
 are
 hoping
 the
 baby
 bonuses


together
 with
 a
 host
 of
 other


familyfriendly
 policies
 will
 help
 boost


South
 Korea's
 fertility
 rate.
 That's
 now


at
 just
 0.75
 births
 per
 woman,
 the


lowest
 on
 the
 planet.
 Korea
 is
 indeed


facing
 a
 population
 crisis.
 The


population
 is
 projected
 to
 shrink
 by


almost
 a
 third
 by
 2072
 if
 we
 don't
 do


something.
 And
 it
 has
 massive


implications.
 There
 will
 be
 a
 shrinking


workforce.
 Tax
 revenue
 will
 be
 falling.


And
 Korea
 is
 technically
 at
 war
 against


North
 Korea.
 And
 there
 will
 be
 no
 people


joining
 the
 military
 to
 protect
 the


country.

This
 is
 the
 big
 take
 Asia
 from
 Bloomberg


News.
 I'm
 Juan
 Ha.
 Every
 week,
 we
 take


you
 inside
 some
 of
 the
 world's
 biggest


and
 most
 powerful
 economies
 and
 the


markets,
 tycoons,
 and
 businesses
 that


drive
 this
 evershifting
 region.
 Today
 on


the
 show,
 why
 are
 Korean
 companies


paying
 their
 employees
 big
 bucks
 to
 have


babies?
 And
 are
 baby
 bonuses
 a
 long-term


solution?


Global
 birth
 rates
 have
 been
 declining


for
 decades,
 falling
 from
 five
 births


per
 woman
 in
 1960
 to
 just
 above
 two
 last


year.
 The
 phenomenon
 is
 especially


pronounced
 in
 South
 Korea,
 which
 has
 had


the
 lowest
 birth
 rate
 in
 the
 world
 for


most
 of
 the
 past
 two
 decades.


>> It's
 a
 top
 priority
 for
 the
 government


for
 many
 years.
 And
 last
 year,
 the


former
 president,
 he
 declared
 a
 national


demographic
 emergency.


>> Hyon
 Hi
 Shin
 is
 a
 Bloomberg
 reporter


based
 in
 Seoul.


>> So
 the
 government
 has
 been
 spending


hundreds
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars
 to
 fix


the
 problem.


>> Developed
 countries
 with
 low
 birth
 rates


like
 South
 Korea
 worry
 that
 unless
 they


have
 more
 babies,
 they
 won't
 have
 enough


workers
 to
 support
 their
 economies
 and


enough
 taxpayers
 to
 support
 their
 aging


populations.


In
 South
 Korea,
 the
 government's
 tried


expanding
 child
 care
 subsidies,


extending
 parental
 leave,
 offering


mortgages
 at
 lower
 rates,
 even
 offering


financial
 support
 for
 soul
 residents


looking
 to
 reverse
 vasectomies.
 By
 law,


a
 couple
 can
 have
 combined
 3
 years
 of


shared
 parental
 leave.
 You
 can
 use
 those


three
 years
 at
 any
 time
 and
 up
 until


your
 child
 becomes
 8
 years
 old.


Korea
 is
 not
 the
 only
 Asian
 nation


offering
 incentives
 to
 wouldbe
 parents.


In
 Hong
 Kong,
 residents
 are
 entitled
 to


14
 weeks
 of
 paid
 maternity
 leave
 and
 a


onetime
 baby
 bonus
 of
 $2,600.


In
 Japan,
 families
 with
 three
 or
 more


kids
 are
 eligible
 to
 get
 most
 of
 their


university
 tuition
 fees
 covered
 by
 the


government.
 But
 Korea's
 efforts
 to


tackle
 its
 declining
 birth
 rate
 go
 above


and
 beyond
 what
 many
 other
 countries
 are


willing
 to
 do.
 And
 now
 Korean


corporations
 like
 Buouyang
 are
 jumping


in
 with
 initiatives
 of
 their
 own.


>> They
 were
 the
 first
 one
 to
 go
 very
 big.


And
 and
 the
 founder,
 he's
 pretty
 old.


He's
 84,
 but
 he's
 been
 doing
 lots
 of


philanthropy
 work
 over
 the
 past
 several


years.
 And
 February
 last
 year,
 the


company
 usually
 holds
 New
 Year
 ceremony.


So
 where
 the
 founder
 comes
 up
 and
 then


he
 gives
 a
 speech.
 It
 was
 supposed
 to
 be


just
 a
 regular
 ceremony,
 but
 he
 made
 a


surprise
 announcement.
 The
 founder


announced
 the
 company
 would
 give
 100


million
 Korean
 Juan,
 about
 $72,000


to
 every
 employee
 who
 welcomes
 a
 baby.


And
 the
 new
 policy
 applied
 to
 all
 babies


born
 within
 the
 past
 3
 years.


>> There
 was
 a
 little
 of
 silence
 and
 then


some
 people
 were
 um
 shouting
 and
 then


some
 people
 were
 almost
 like
 breaking
 up


in
 tears.


>> For
 some
 couples,
 it
 was
 like
 winning


the
 lottery.
 $72,000
 is
 about
 double
 the


annual
 per
 capita
 income
 in
 Korea.
 And


the
 money
 goes
 directly
 into
 the


employees
 bank
 account
 and
 isn't
 taxed


by
 the
 government.


>> You
 can't
 really
 buy
 a
 house
 with
 that,


but
 you
 can
 get
 a
 new
 car
 and
 then
 you


can
 hire,
 you
 know,
 some
 people
 who
 can


help
 take
 care
 of
 your
 baby
 or
 your


house.


>> At
 Buouyong,
 the
 bonus
 doesn't
 have
 any


conditions
 attached.
 Employees
 can
 even


get
 their
 baby
 payout
 and
 quit
 the
 next


day.
 But
 no
 one
 has.
 Out
 of
 the
 100
 or


so
 employees
 that
 have
 gotten
 the


bonuses,
 Buong
 said
 all
 are
 still
 with


the
 company.
 And
 since
 introducing
 the


baby
 bonus
 more
 than
 a
 year
 ago,
 the


company
 believes
 it's
 seeing
 an
 impact.


Buy
 has
 given
 out
 the
 bonus
 to
 about
 100


employees
 so
 far
 and
 they
 paid
 28


employees
 um
 last
 year.
 That's
 about


five
 people
 more
 than
 the
 previous
 three


years
 on
 average.
 And
 the
 company
 thinks


the
 policy
 did
 encourage
 some
 people
 to


have
 babies.
 And
 in
 Korea,
 the
 corporate


culture
 has
 been
 pretty
 rigid.
 And
 it's


also
 construction
 company
 where
 it's


dominated
 by
 male
 employees
 mostly.
 So


it
 has
 to
 be
 long
 work
 hours
 and
 very


paternalistic
 office
 culture.
 Because


they
 introduced
 this
 policy,
 employees


are
 encouraging
 each
 other
 to
 have


babies
 and
 then
 get
 married
 and
 be
 on


parental
 leave.
 So
 there
 is
 some
 change


in
 the
 making.
 Hongi
 says
 Buyouong's


apparent
 success
 has
 inspired
 other
 big


companies
 in
 Korea
 to
 follow
 suit.
 She


found
 dozens
 of
 public
 and
 private


companies
 are
 offering
 payouts
 to


employees
 who
 have
 babies.
 And
 handouts


like
 these
 are
 costing
 Korean
 companies


millions
 of
 dollars
 a
 year.


>> With
 Pu
 Young,
 it
 has
 more
 to
 do
 with


the
 founders's
 philosophy.
 He's
 a


patriotic
 man
 and
 he's
 been
 saying
 he


wanted
 to
 give
 back
 to
 the
 society.
 For


other
 companies,
 they
 see
 it
 as
 part
 of


their
 corporate
 social
 responsibility


programs
 and
 it
 also
 helps
 them
 bring


talent.
 In
 the
 end,
 these
 companies


think
 paying
 workers
 right
 now
 to
 have


babies
 could
 be
 cheaper
 in
 the
 very
 long


term
 than
 running
 a
 business
 in
 a


country
 where
 you
 have
 no
 babies
 and
 no


workers
 to
 hire.


>> But
 it's
 unclear
 if
 these
 incentive


programs
 will
 do
 that
 much
 to
 boost


Korea's
 birth
 rate.
 That's
 because
 baby


bonuses
 only
 address
 one
 part
 of
 the


problem.
 Expensive
 child
 care
 in


developed
 countries.
 The
 decision-m


about
 whether
 and
 when
 to
 have
 children


is
 very
 complex.


>> Kathleen
 Mogulgard
 is
 the
 president
 and


CEO
 of
 the
 Population
 Institute,
 a


nonprofit
 in
 Washington
 DC
 that


researches
 population
 trends.
 Often
 it


is
 about
 the
 costs
 of
 raising
 a
 child.


But
 there
 are
 also
 a
 number
 of
 personal


decisions
 about
 timing,
 about
 spacing,


about
 the
 kinds
 of
 relationships
 we
 have


in
 our
 life,
 um,
 around
 whether
 or
 not


we
 feel
 like
 that
 is
 the
 kind
 of
 future


that
 we
 see
 for
 ourselves
 and
 for
 our


families.


Other
 countries
 that
 have
 introduced


baby
 bonuses
 have
 seen
 only
 short-lived


success
 in
 boosting
 birth
 rates.


Australia
 and
 Hungary
 provided
 cash


handouts
 to
 new
 parents
 at
 various
 times


in
 the
 past
 two
 decades.
 And
 while
 they


saw
 an
 initial
 bump
 in
 births,
 their


birth
 rates
 eventually
 declined
 again.


>> What
 we
 have
 seen
 so
 far
 is
 that


governments
 sometimes
 invest
 a
 lot
 of


resources
 in
 these
 kinds
 of
 incentives


and
 it
 doesn't
 move
 the
 needle
 in
 any


significant
 way
 that
 we
 have
 seen
 so


far.


>> In
 Korea,
 though,
 there
 are
 glimmers
 of


hope.
 The
 country's
 birth
 rate
 went
 up


last
 year
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 a


decade.
 And
 while
 it's
 not
 clear
 what


the
 exact
 reason
 was
 for
 the
 uptick
 or


if
 the
 trend
 will
 continue,
 almost
 all


experts
 agree
 that
 handouts
 aren't
 a


permanent
 solution.
 Structural
 changes


are
 in
 places
 where
 fertility
 is


dropping
 very
 low.
 that
 can
 serve
 as
 a


signal
 to
 governments
 to
 take
 a
 look
 at


what
 is
 happening
 in
 society
 that
 is


resulting
 in
 these
 kinds
 of
 extremes
 in


fertility
 uh
 patterns
 and
 that
 could


invite
 us
 to
 better
 understand
 the


barriers
 that
 they
 may
 be
 experiencing


to
 achieving
 their
 childbearing
 desires.


There
 may
 be
 things
 that
 are
 playing
 out


in
 terms
 of
 gender
 equity,
 inflexible


work
 policies,
 or
 dynamics
 culturally


within
 the
 household
 that
 might
 serve
 as


disincentives
 for
 women
 to
 have
 a
 child


or
 have
 another
 child.


[Music]


After
 the
 break,
 the
 economics
 of


declining
 birth
 rates
 and
 what
 could


work
 to
 persuade
 people
 to
 have
 more


babies.


[Music]


Although
 women
 have
 been
 having
 far


fewer
 babies
 on
 average
 compared
 to


previous
 generations,
 the
 world's


population
 is
 still
 growing
 overall.
 The


United
 Nations
 says
 only
 around
 60


countries
 are
 seeing
 their
 populations


decline.
 But
 the
 population
 in
 more
 than


120
 other
 countries,
 including
 the


United
 States,
 is
 still
 growing
 and


appears
 on
 track
 to
 keep
 growing
 for
 the


next
 30
 years.
 Even
 though
 there
 is
 kind


of
 this
 panic
 right
 now
 about
 population


decline,
 we
 are
 actually
 in
 a
 period
 of


continuing
 population
 growth
 for
 decades


to
 come.


>> Kathleen
 Mogulard
 from
 the
 Population


Institute
 sees
 it
 this
 way.
 We're
 not


living
 in
 a
 period
 of
 demographic


decline,
 but
 demographic
 diversity.


>> The
 world's
 population
 is
 likely
 to
 add


another
 2
 billion
 people
 through
 this


century.
 We're
 currently
 at
 about
 8.2


billion
 people
 globally.
 Projections


from
 the
 United
 Nations
 indicate
 that
 we


are
 likely
 to
 continue
 to
 grow
 through


this
 century
 globally
 to
 about
 10
 or


more
 billion
 by
 the
 mid
 2080s.


She
 says
 in
 some
 ways
 the
 story
 of
 the


birth
 rate
 decline
 is
 actually
 one
 of


progress.


>> There
 have
 been
 more
 opportunities
 for


women
 and
 girls
 around
 the
 world,
 an


expansion
 of
 rights
 for
 women
 and
 girls


when
 it
 comes
 to
 education,
 when
 it


comes
 to
 entering
 the
 workforce,
 and


when
 it
 comes
 to
 accessing
 the
 services


and
 the
 information
 that
 enable
 women
 to


have
 agency
 over
 their
 reproductive


lives.
 And
 new
 research
 shows
 that
 in


places
 with
 ultra-
 low
 fertility
 rates


like
 South
 Korea,
 gender
 dynamics
 have
 a


lot
 to
 do
 with
 why
 women
 are
 having


fewer
 kids.
 Emerging
 research
 indicates


cultural
 changes
 around
 gender
 roles.


And
 the
 greater
 sharing
 of
 household


responsibilities
 and
 duties
 between
 men


and
 women
 is
 something
 that
 can
 be


really
 supportive
 of
 women's
 decisionm


about
 whether
 to
 have
 a
 child
 or
 to
 have


another
 child.
 when
 she
 can
 have
 that


assurance
 that
 those
 responsibilities


will
 be
 shared
 equally.


>> And
 while
 South
 Korea's
 fertility


incentives
 and
 baby
 bonuses
 are
 aimed
 at


supporting
 its
 economy,
 Kathleen
 argues


countries
 don't
 necessarily
 need
 more


babies
 to
 sustain
 their
 economic
 growth.


>> So
 for
 example,
 in
 Japan,
 which
 has
 been


in
 population
 decline
 for
 quite
 some


time,
 uh
 the
 per
 capita
 GDP
 in
 Japan


continues
 on
 an
 upward
 trajectory.
 So
 if


we're
 thinking
 about
 what
 it
 means
 to


have
 a
 healthy
 economic
 life
 for
 the


individual,
 there
 has
 been
 continued


economic
 growth
 on
 an
 individual
 level


even
 as
 that
 country
 is
 experiencing


population
 decline.
 So
 the
 overall


economic
 picture
 for
 countries
 is
 less


about
 the
 number
 of
 people
 but
 more


about
 kind
 of
 economic
 productivity


within
 a
 country.
 And
 there
 are
 lots
 of


different
 ways
 to
 stimulate
 economic


productivity.
 We
 can
 invest
 more
 in


training
 and
 in
 education
 for
 people.
 We


can
 think
 about
 ways
 to
 shift
 economic


systems
 so
 that
 we
 get
 greater
 output


from
 the
 same
 number
 of
 people
 or
 fewer


numbers
 of
 people.


>> To
 maintain
 a
 stable
 population
 where


there's
 no
 growth
 or
 decline,
 the


average
 woman
 needs
 to
 have
 roughly
 two


children.
 Bloomberg's
 Hyong
 Hi
 Shin
 says


South
 Korea
 is
 still
 a
 long
 way
 short
 of


that
 number.
 And
 even
 the
 South
 Korean


government
 acknowledges
 that
 to
 close


that
 gap,
 it'll
 need
 more
 than
 a
 few


companies
 offering
 baby
 bonuses.


>> Their
 goal
 is
 to
 raise
 the
 fertility


rate
 to
 one
 by
 2030.
 Right
 now,
 it's
 at


0.75.


And
 the
 government
 panel
 that
 I


interviewed
 said
 you
 have
 to
 be
 working


five
 times
 harder
 to
 reach
 that
 goal.


Experts
 say
 money
 is
 a
 good
 way
 to


encourage
 people
 to
 have
 babies
 but
 you


know
 there
 has
 to
 be
 more
 other
 uh


issues
 being
 resolved.
 So
 at
 smaller


companies
 you
 might
 not
 get
 a
 bonus
 but


they
 can
 be
 more
 flexible
 and
 it
 has
 to


come
 all
 together
 to
 move
 the
 middle
 and


bring
 about
 real
 change.
