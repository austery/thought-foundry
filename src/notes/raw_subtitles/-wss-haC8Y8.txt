Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 It


is
 Monday,
 October
 27th.
 We
 are
 live.
 It


is
 the
 first
 market
 open
 coming
 to


everybody
 uh
 from
 someone
 who
 is
 now


officially
 28
 years
 old.
 It's
 actually


the
 day
 the
 day
 that
 you
 all
 have
 been


wishing
 happy
 birthday
 for
 for
 the
 past


364
 days.
 Today
 is
 actually
 the
 day
 uh


for
 for
 us
 to
 have
 my
 birthday.
 You


know,
 it's
 so
 funny
 that
 this
 thing


became
 a
 meme.
 It's
 like
 it's
 it's
 it's


it's
 like
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 it


became
 a
 meme
 of
 just
 wishing
 someone


happy
 birthday,
 but
 it
 came
 it
 became
 a


meme
 to
 such
 an
 extent
 that
 Tom
 Lee


thought
 it
 was
 my
 birthday
 back
 in


August
 because
 a
 bunch
 of
 you
 guys
 said


it
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 he's
 going
 to
 see


my
 actual
 birthday
 today
 and
 what
 he's


going
 to
 say,
 but
 there
 we
 go.
 We're


live
 and
 um
 officially
 28
 years
 old


today.
 Thank
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.


We
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about,
 a
 lot
 to
 get


into.
 We
 got
 this
 China
 US
 trade
 update


which
 obviously
 is
 very
 important
 for


the
 markets
 and
 you
 can
 see
 right
 now
 in


the
 pre-markets
 we
 are
 greeny
 green.


It's
 the
 best
 birthday
 gift
 I
 guess
 you


could
 ask
 and
 alltime
 high
 across
 the


market.
 Maybe
 pounding
 push
 for
 190


today
 which
 would
 be
 very
 nice.
 We
 got
 a


bunch
 of
 different
 macro
 updates
 that


seem
 to
 be
 pretty
 bullish
 in
 regards
 to


rate
 cuts
 coming
 up.
 Uh
 labor
 market


data
 and
 a
 few
 other
 things
 that
 seem
 to


be
 at
 least
 helping
 the
 way
 we
 have
 some


of
 this
 pre-market
 momentum
 which
 is


also
 really
 important.
 Uh
 and
 then
 we


have
 earnings.
 We
 have
 a
 couple
 of


earnings
 in
 the
 pre-market
 that
 are


pretty
 important
 to
 talk
 about.
 We'll


talk
 about
 some
 earnings
 after
 the
 close


as
 well.
 But
 tomorrow
 we
 got
 SoFi,


PayPal,
 and
 UNH
 in
 the
 morning.
 And
 then


after
 that,
 you've
 got
 Amazon,
 Apple
 on


Thursday,
 Microsoft,
 Google,
 and
 Meta
 on


Wednesday
 along
 with
 rate
 cuts
 on


Wednesday.
 The
 FOMC
 decision.
 There's
 a


96.7%
 chance
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 rate


cut.
 So,
 it
 is
 just
 going
 to
 be
 a
 wild,


wild
 week.
 Uh
 it's
 a
 week
 for
 everyone


to
 lock
 in.
 This
 is
 a
 week
 where,
 you


know,
 portfolios
 can
 really
 take
 some


massive
 swings
 hopefully
 to
 the
 upside.


At least
 right
 now,
 we're
 experiencing


to
 the
 upside.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 the


majority
 of
 people
 here
 probably
 are


recovering
 anything
 they
 lost
 over
 the


past
 couple
 weeks
 in
 the
 pre-markets


alone,
 potentially
 even
 even
 hitting
 new


all-time
 highs
 in
 the
 portfolio.
 So,


very
 very
 very
 exciting
 stuff.
 We
 got
 a


lot
 to
 get
 into,
 a
 lot
 to
 get
 going,
 and


I
 am
 excited
 to
 be
 here
 uh
 for
 another


day


to
 to
 talk
 to
 everybody.
 Yes,
 we
 have


Amcore
 earnings
 after
 the
 bell
 as
 well.


So,
 we'll
 get
 into
 all
 that
 and
 uh
 we'll


see
 all
 the
 other
 earnings
 we
 have
 later


today.
 Again,
 thank
 you
 everybody
 for


the
 happy
 birthday
 wishes.
 I
 guess
 I'll


just
 take
 like
 a
 couple
 minutes
 right


here
 and
 just
 say
 something
 and
 then


we'll
 get
 into
 we'll
 get
 into
 the
 market


open.
 First
 of
 all,
 I
 I
 just
 um
 I'll
 get


to
 all
 the
 super
 chats
 at
 the
 end
 as


well
 so
 we
 can
 just
 do
 them
 all
 at
 once


at
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 show
 and
 um
 I
 can


individually
 thank
 everybody.
 But
 look,


I
 am
 very
 very very
 grateful
 to
 be
 in


the
 position
 I'm
 in.
 I
 think
 as
 you
 get


older,
 you
 start
 reflecting
 a
 little
 bit


more
 on
 your
 life.
 This
 book
 about
 Karp


is
 coming
 out.
 I
 read
 this
 entire
 book


over
 the
 weekend
 and
 uh
 you
 know,
 it's


about
 his
 life.
 It's
 an
 autobiography
 on


Karp.
 And
 so
 as
 I
 was
 reading
 this
 book


on
 someone
 who
 has
 fundamentally
 changed


my
 life,
 much
 less
 changed
 so
 many
 of


our
 lives
 and
 you
 know
 one
 of the


reasons
 I'm
 even
 here
 today
 is
 because
 I


I
 I
 chose
 to
 take
 a
 chance
 on
 analyzing


his
 company.
 It
 really
 made
 me


reflective
 about
 my
 life
 and
 just


thinking
 about
 what
 has
 happened
 over


the
 past
 28
 years.
 Um
 and
 more
 than


anything
 I
 thought
 about
 what
 has


happened
 over
 the
 past
 four
 years
 which


is
 you
 know
 this
 entire
 community
 being


built.
 I
 think
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 most


intrinsic
 elements,
 the
 most
 objectively


intrinsic
 things
 that
 we
 can
 all
 agree


on
 as
 a
 species
 is
 that
 all
 of
 us
 need


community.
 You
 know,
 whether
 you're


Democrat,
 Republican,
 no matter
 what


race,
 gender,
 it's
 like
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day,
 you
 need
 a
 community
 for
 some


level
 of
 meaningful
 happiness.
 It's


really
 hard
 to
 just
 be
 individualistic


your
 entire
 life
 and
 only
 care
 about


yourself.
 uh
 because
 because
 all
 the


gains
 of
 life,
 whether
 it's
 through


through
 professional
 success,
 financial


success,
 it's
 hard
 to
 celebrate
 it
 if


there's
 no
 emotional
 gains.
 And
 a
 lot
 of


those
 emotional
 gains
 come
 from


celebrating
 your
 wins
 with
 a
 community.


And
 so,
 uh
 I
 I
 I
 just
 think
 one
 of
 the


things
 I'm
 the
 most
 proud
 of
 over
 the


past
 28
 years
 that
 I've
 been
 able
 to
 do


is
 is
 somehow
 develop
 a
 skill
 set
 that


would
 be
 necessary
 to
 cultivate
 a


community
 and
 then
 over
 the
 past
 four


years
 have
 the
 work
 ethic
 to
 to
 build


this
 community
 to
 be
 where
 it
 is
 today.


And
 I
 would
 not
 be
 here,
 if
 I
 don't
 say


this
 enough,
 I
 would
 not
 be
 here
 without


you
 guys.
 I
 would
 not
 be
 here
 every


morning.
 I
 would
 not
 be
 able
 to
 be
 in


this
 position.
 I
 would
 not
 get
 the


opportunities
 I
 get
 to
 to
 be
 invited
 to


these
 events
 from
 all
 these
 uh
 you
 know,


companies
 that
 that
 want
 to
 talk
 to
 me.


I
 would
 not
 be
 able
 to
 be
 invited
 to
 go


do
 podcasts
 with
 all
 these
 CEOs
 unless


there
 was
 there
 was
 an
 audience
 that


cared.
 And
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 guys
 cared


and
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 guys
 have
 been
 so


happy
 about
 my
 journey
 over
 the
 past


four
 years,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 it's


I
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 to
 say.
 It
 is
 it


is
 the
 journey
 of
 a
 lifetime.
 And
 on
 a


day
 like
 today,
 as
 you
 get
 older,
 you


start
 to
 get
 really
 really
 grateful
 over


the
 things
 that
 you've
 done
 in
 your


life.
 And
 you
 really
 want
 to
 make
 sure


that
 you
 let
 people
 know
 how
 grateful


you
 are
 because
 time
 is
 fleeting.
 We


don't
 know
 how
 much
 time
 we
 have
 on
 this


planet.
 That's
 the
 uh
 that's
 the
 what
 is


it?
 That's
 the
 paradox
 of
 getting
 older.


It's
 like
 you're
 celebrating
 life,
 but


at
 the
 same
 time,
 you
 are
 getting
 closer


to
 the
 end
 of
 life
 if
 we're
 just,
 you


know,
 being
 objective
 about
 it.
 And
 so
 I


think
 in
 these
 moments
 it's
 really


really
 important
 to
 just
 let
 people
 know


how
 much
 you
 care
 about
 the
 journey
 that


you've
 been
 on
 and
 and
 how
 much
 you


appreciate
 the
 support
 that
 they've
 had


on
 that
 journey.
 Even
 if
 they've
 not


been
 on
 every
 part
 of
 that
 journey
 and


even
 if
 they've
 not
 been
 affected
 by


every
 part
 of
 the
 journey,
 the
 fact
 that


they've
 been
 part
 of
 it
 is


it
 it
 just
 means
 the
 world
 and
 there's


there's
 really
 uh
 there
 there's
 really


not
 many
 words
 to
 describe
 that.
 So


there
 we
 go.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 If
 it's
 your
 birthday
 as


well
 today,
 happy
 birthday
 to
 you
 as


well.
 I
 think
 I
 see
 a
 couple
 other


people
 that
 say
 it's
 their
 birthday.
 So,


pretty
 incredible.
 77s
 says
 I'm
 38


today.
 I
 love
 it.
 2838,
 we're
 here.


We're
 alive.


Thank
 you
 all
 for
 the
 super
 chats.
 I'll


read
 them
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 show
 so


we
 can
 get
 through
 everything.
 But
 once


again,
 deeply,
 deeply,
 deeply,
 deeply,


deeply
 appreciate
 from
 the
 bottom
 of
 my


heart
 all
 of
 you
 guys
 allow
 me
 to
 live


my
 dream
 every
 single
 day.
 Man's
 talking


like
 he's
 70
 years
 old.
 Are
 you
 dying
 of


it?
 No,
 I'm
 not.
 But
 just
 like
 look,
 I
 I


really
 do
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 people


understand
 how
 grateful
 I
 am.
 This
 is
 a


very
 privileged
 position
 to
 be
 in
 this


situation.
 Uh
 and
 and
 I
 know
 I've
 worked


my
 ass
 off
 to
 get
 here,
 but
 no
 matter


how
 hard
 you
 work,
 you
 still
 you
 need
 a


little
 bit
 of
 of
 luck
 on
 your
 side
 in


terms
 of,
 you
 know,
 you
 need
 people
 to


laugh
 at
 your
 jokes,
 and
 you
 guys
 laugh.


You
 guys
 really
 do
 laugh.
 I
 mean,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 on
 YouTube
 that


try
 to
 go
 live
 and
 get
 people
 to
 laugh


at
 their
 jokes,
 and
 no
 one
 cares,
 and


you
 guys
 care.
 Now,
 one
 would
 argue


you're
 laughing
 at
 me,
 not
 with
 me.
 But


the
 point
 is,
 as
 long
 as
 there's
 a


laugh,
 it
 really
 doesn't
 matter.
 And
 so,


the
 fact
 that
 you
 guys
 choose
 to
 laugh


and
 choose
 to
 be
 here,
 it
 means
 a
 lot.


It
 really,
 really,
 really
 means
 a
 lot.


And
 I
 wish
 I
 could
 thank
 each
 of
 you
 in


person
 one
 day.
 So,
 so,
 you
 know,
 we're


getting
 closer
 to
 2026.
 I'm
 going
 to


have
 more
 details
 on
 the
 meetups.


Hopefully,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 can
 come
 to


those
 meetups.
 And,
 uh,
 I
 can


individually
 thank
 every
 single
 person


in
 person
 for
 for
 being
 part
 of
 this


community.
 I
 mean,
 this
 community
 is
 is


is
 the
 reason
 why
 I'm
 I'm
 happy
 to
 be


doing
 what
 I'm
 doing.
 I
 mean,
 I
 am
 happy


to
 be
 alive
 on
 a
 daily
 basis
 because
 I


get
 to
 do
 this.
 And
 the
 fact
 that
 this


could
 bring
 any
 level
 of
 happiness
 to


the
 people
 that
 are
 part
 of
 what
 we're


doing
 every
 day,
 it
 just
 means
 the


world.
 It
 really
 truly
 it
 it
 means


everything
 to
 me.


All
 right,
 let's
 get
 started.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Let's
 get
 into


it.
 What
 do
 we
 got
 going
 on?
 Well,
 we're


green.
 We
 are
 greeny
 green
 and
 we
 are


even
 more
 green
 than
 where
 we
 were
 last


night.
 We
 had
 68205.
 We're
 at
 680272.


Tesla's
 up
 1%.
 Palanteer's
 up
 2%.
 Hoodie


is
 up
 3.1%
 potentially
 making
 its
 way


back
 to
 150.
 Grab
 back
 above
 $6.
 Google


264.
 Google
 signed
 a
 big
 deal
 with


Anthropic.
 It
 was
 confirmed
 over
 the


weekend.
 Massive
 level
 of
 TPUs
 are
 going


to
 be
 or
 going
 to
 be
 purchased
 by


Anthropic.
 So,
 that's
 really
 helping


Google
 price
 right
 now.
 Reddit's
 up
 3%.


Amazon,
 shout
 out
 to
 everyone
 who
 bought


Amazon
 with
 me.
 213,
 215,
 217,
 even
 222.


I
 mean
 literally
 there
 like
 it's
 just


been
 a
 great
 opportunity
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks
 and
 you
 got
 Amazon
 moving


higher
 228.
 Hopefully
 we
 can
 crack
 that


230
 level
 before
 we
 get
 into
 earnings.


Uh
 Nvidia
 back
 to
 190.
 Very
 nice
 to
 see


pounder
 189.
 Maybe
 pounder
 and
 Nvidia


are
 going
 to
 be
 twins
 today.
 You
 got


pounder
 right
 there.
 18904.
 Micro


strategy
 is
 up.
 AS
 is
 up.
 Him's
 back


above
 50.
 Roblox
 is
 up.
 Crowd
 Strike
 is


up.
 Coinbase
 is
 up.
 Coreweave
 is
 up.


Rocket
 Lab
 is
 up.
 Nebus
 is
 up.
 Look
 at


that.
 12195
 on
 Nebus.
 Ren
 is
 up.
 I
 mean,


it's
 just
 a
 massive,
 massive
 day,
 which


to
 be
 honest,
 look,
 is
 very
 green
 for
 a


variety
 of
 reasons.
 Could
 I
 see
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 sell-off,
 a
 little
 bit
 of


people
 taking
 some
 profits?
 Of
 course,


we're
 already
 seeing
 that.
 Some
 of these


pre-market
 prices
 are
 lower
 than
 where


they
 were
 last
 night.
 So,
 I
 don't
 think


that
 should
 scare
 anyone
 if
 we
 see
 that.


But
 the
 trend
 is
 on
 the
 right
 side,
 and


we're
 going
 to
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 today


talking
 about
 the
 trend
 from
 a
 macro


perspective
 and
 geopolitical


perspective,
 and
 ultimately
 the


conclusion
 on
 where
 I
 think
 this
 market


can
 go
 over
 the
 next
 coming
 months
 if
 we


continue
 this
 trend.
 SoFi,
 I
 did
 buy


another
 500
 shares
 on
 Friday.
 I
 didn't


go
 live
 on
 the
 market
 close.
 Um,


honestly,
 I
 just
 I
 just
 really
 wasn't


feeling
 the
 best
 in
 the
 market
 close.


And
 that
 that
 was
 another
 thing
 I
 forgot


to
 mention.
 Like
 I
 I
 I
 posted
 I
 I
 wasn't


going
 to
 go
 live
 on
 the
 market
 close.


And
 the
 amount
 of
 comments
 underneath


that
 post
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 just
 said,


"Dude,
 we
 love
 you,
 but
 you
 are
 part
 of


our
 schedule
 and
 uh
 we
 hope
 you
 get


better
 because
 you
 know,
 missing
 the


market
 close
 is
 something
 that
 actually


affects
 our
 lives
 because
 we
 you
 know,


we
 we
 we
 want
 to
 have
 that
 part
 of
 our


life."
 I
 mean,
 that
 means
 a
 lot.
 Now,


there
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 comments


suggesting
 that
 my
 throat
 was
 hurting


because
 I
 was
 on
 a
 grinder
 date.
 And


that's
 that's
 that's
 for
 another


conversation.
 Those
 were
 those
 were


those
 were
 about
 20%
 of
 the
 comments.


But
 the
 other
 80%
 of
 comments,
 which
 is


very
 very
 nice,
 and
 it
 was
 very
 very


humbling
 to
 uh
 to
 know
 that
 I
 really


wish
 I
 want
 I
 could
 go
 live.
 I
 just
 I


felt
 horrible,
 dude.
 I
 don't
 know
 what


was
 happening
 on
 Friday,
 but
 I
 felt
 if
 I


couldn't
 give
 my
 full
 100%
 then
 it


wasn't
 worth
 going
 live.
 But
 um
 look,
 I


bought
 another
 500
 shares
 of
 SoFi
 on


Friday.
 I
 I
 I
 couldn't
 say
 anything


because
 I
 didn't
 go
 live,
 so
 I
 couldn't


announce
 it.
 But
 $3010,
 my
 average
 is


now
 $29.5.
 I
 mean,
 let's
 see
 if
 Noto
 can


give
 us
 that
 35
 level.
 Have
 a,000


shares.
 And
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 tomorrow


morning
 what
 happens
 with
 SoFi
 and
 if
 uh


if
 we
 can
 keep
 going
 from
 there.
 New


Bank
 is
 up,
 Door
 Dash
 is
 up,
 Delta's
 up,


JD
 is
 up,
 Oaklow
 is
 up,
 you've
 got
 And


that
 is
 up.
 Big
 Bear
 AI
 that
 is
 up.
 A


lot
 of the
 momentum
 stocks
 that
 took
 a


bit
 a
 big
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 draw
 down
 over
 the


past
 couple
 weeks,
 those
 are
 starting
 to


recover
 a
 bit.
 So,
 it's
 pretty
 much
 an


everything
 rally.
 AMD
 259.
 It
 is
 pretty


much
 an
 everything
 rally.
 The
 only
 thing


that's
 down


is
 gold,
 which
 is
 actually
 bullish


because
 you
 don't
 want
 a
 riskoff
 asset


rallying
 while
 the
 market's
 rallying


because
 it
 tends
 to
 be
 a
 little
 wonky.


Now,
 granted,
 gold
 is
 down
 a
 couple


percentage
 points
 after
 being
 up
 60%
 for


the
 year.
 But
 it
 does
 signal
 maybe


there's
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 risk
 on
 versus


risk
 off.
 And
 I
 know
 gold
 is


conventionally
 seen
 as
 riskoff,
 but


maybe
 after
 the
 60%
 rally
 this
 year,


gold
 is
 now
 risk.
 But
 you
 are
 seeing
 a


little bit
 of
 weakness
 in
 some
 of
 the


commodity
 trades
 which
 potentially
 is


good
 for
 the
 equity
 markets
 as
 more
 of


that
 money
 maybe
 transitions
 into
 taking


more
 risk.
 More
 risk
 means
 more
 of
 these


risk
 assets
 that
 we
 all
 own
 like
 tech


stocks
 tend
 to
 do
 a
 little
 bit
 better


which
 is
 very
 exciting
 to
 see.
 Rare


earths
 are
 down
 today
 and
 the
 reason


rare
 earths
 are
 down
 is
 because
 it
 does


look
 like
 based
 on
 what
 Trump
 said
 and


we
 have
 a
 couple
 clips
 to
 watch
 uh
 that


they
 are
 getting
 to
 an
 agreement
 on
 rare


earth
 metals
 and
 minerals
 which
 means


the
 demand
 for
 the
 domestic
 suppliers
 of


those
 rare
 earth
 stocks.
 I
 mean
 that


demand
 is
 still
 going
 to
 be
 there.
 It's


just
 not
 going
 to
 be
 potentially
 at
 the


level
 that
 it
 was
 three
 weeks
 ago
 when


we
 thought
 that
 China
 and
 the
 US
 were


decoupling.
 And
 so
 that's
 why
 those


stocks
 are
 down.
 I
 can
 see
 them


recovering.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 they
 get


back
 to
 all-time
 highs
 anytime
 soon,
 but


nonetheless,
 uh,
 it
 is
 good
 for
 the


broader
 American
 supply
 chain
 if
 we
 have


China
 supplying
 rare
 earths.
 And,
 you


know,
 that's
 good
 for
 the
 broader
 equity


markets
 as
 well.
 So,
 yeah,
 not
 so
 rare


earths
 on
 a
 day
 like
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,


they
 were
 rallying
 because
 we
 thought
 we


were
 not
 going
 to
 be
 friends
 with
 China


anymore.
 If
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 friends


with
 China,
 which
 it
 seems
 like
 we
 are,


then
 they
 probably
 wouldn't
 rally.
 But


outside
 of
 that,
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 other


risk
 on
 assets
 that
 are
 just
 getting


momentum
 and
 it
 is
 very,
 very
 exciting.


See,
 Lululemon
 is
 up.
 Is
 that
 actually


up?
 Lululemon.


Wow.
 Lulu's
 up
 5%.


I
 mean,
 dude,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 hard
 to


find
 unless
 we
 get
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 selloff


today.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 hard
 to
 I
 mean,


this
 is
 a
 broad-based
 market
 rally.


We're
 getting
 into
 the
 end
 of the
 year.


Let's
 get
 into
 some
 of
 the
 reason
 for


why
 we
 are
 seeing
 this
 broad-based


rally.
 But
 I'd
 be
 very
 curious
 to
 see
 if


we
 actually
 end
 the
 day
 red
 or
 green
 and


if
 we
 can
 hold
 on
 to
 this
 momentum
 and


what
 stock


lose
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 steam.
 Let's
 do


that
 poll
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat.
 Green


or
 red
 to
 end
 out
 the
 day.


I
 mean,
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 green


day.
 I
 I
 I
 could
 see
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


sell-off
 towards
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 day,


maybe
 taking
 some
 profits
 from
 the


all-time
 highs,
 but
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 this


is
 enough
 momentum
 to
 the
 downside
 given


how
 many
 of
 the
 narrative
 catalysts
 have


started
 to
 come
 in
 the
 direction
 of
 the


bulls
 and
 if
 those
 continues,


you
 know,
 we
 probably
 continue
 to
 get
 a


bit
 more
 a
 bit
 more
 green.
 All right,
 so


let's
 get
 Lulu
 partnered
 with
 the
 NFL.


Really?
 Okay.
 Well,
 there
 you
 go.
 Lulu


and
 the
 NFL.
 I
 guess
 that's
 enough
 to


pump
 up
 the
 stock.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 they


definitely
 needed
 something
 different.


Yeah.
 Lulu
 is
 partnering
 with
 the
 NFL
 to


launch
 an
 apparel
 collection
 for
 all
 32


NFL
 teams,
 huh?


Okay.
 I
 mean,
 the
 NFL
 is
 hot
 right
 now.


You
 got
 advertising
 on
 the
 NFL
 reaching


all-time
 highs.
 You
 have
 the
 prediction


markets
 being
 massive
 for
 the
 NFL.
 So,


looks
 like
 Lulu
 is
 tapping
 into
 some
 of


that
 mind
 share,
 and
 that
 should
 be


helping
 them
 as
 well.
 All right,
 so


let's
 get
 into
 a
 bunch
 of
 the
 talks
 we


have.
 First
 of
 all,
 what's
 going
 on
 with


China?
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 quotes
 by
 Bent


over
 the
 weekend
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 stuff


is
 pretty
 bullish.
 Here
 is
 what
 he
 said


and
 here
 is
 why
 the
 markets
 are
 rallying


based
 off
 his
 comments
 in
 regards
 to


China.


>> This
 was
 the
 fifth
 meeting
 that
 I've
 had


with
 my
 Chinese
 counterpart,
 the
 vice


premier
 Julie
 Fun
 and
 we
 covered
 a
 wide


range
 of
 issues
 and
 I
 think
 we've


reached
 a
 substantial
 framework
 for
 the


two
 leaders
 who
 will
 meet
 in
 Korea
 next


Thursday.
 So
 uh
 you
 know
 on
 the
 on
 the


table
 the
 president
 had
 given
 me
 maximum


leverage
 when
 he
 threatened
 100%
 tariffs


if
 the
 Chinese
 impose
 their
 rare
 earth


uh
 global
 export
 controls.
 So
 I
 think
 we


have
 averted
 that.
 So
 the
 the
 tariffs


will
 be
 averted
 and
 we
 have
 a
 regular


meeting
 regular
 quarterly
 meeting
 uh


with
 the
 Chinese.
 uh
 it
 was
 scheduled


for
 November
 10th
 or
 before
 November


10th.
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 will
 have
 to
 have


that.
 So
 uh
 we
 have
 been
 rolling
 the


tariffs
 quarterly.
 So
 we
 agreed
 on
 that.


We
 also
 agreed
 on
 substantial


agriculture
 purchases
 for
 US
 farmers.
 We


agreed
 that
 the
 Chinese
 would
 begin
 to


help
 us
 uh
 with
 the
 precursor
 chemicals


for
 this
 terrible
 fentanyl
 epidemic


that's
 ravaging
 our
 country.
 So
 I
 would


say
 that
 it
 was
 a
 very
 good
 meeting


overall.


>> So
 I
 mean
 you're
 hearing
 it
 right
 there


from
 Basent
 and
 then
 not
 only
 did
 Basent


say
 that
 the
 Chinese
 embassy
 and
 the
 US


this
 is
 what
 they
 said
 yesterday.
 Uh


both
 sides
 agree
 that
 the
 strategic


guidance
 of
 the
 two
 heads
 of
 state
 they


will
 make
 full
 use
 of
 the
 Chinese
 US


economic
 trading
 consultation
 mechanism


maintain
 close
 communication
 on


respective
 concerns
 and
 promote
 the


healthy
 sustainable
 development
 of


economic
 and
 trade
 relations
 to
 benefit


the
 two
 peoples
 and
 contribute
 to
 global


prosperity.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 you've
 got
 the


Chinese
 basically
 agreeing
 with
 Bent


right
 there
 that
 we
 are
 going
 to
 be
 uh


working
 with
 the
 US
 to
 actually
 make
 a


deal
 happen.
 And
 then
 you've
 got
 Trump


confirming
 that
 uh
 negotiations
 are


going
 so
 well
 or
 at
 least
 initial
 talks


are
 going
 so
 well
 that
 he's
 going
 to
 be


meeting
 Xi
 pretty
 soon
 either
 in
 China


or
 in
 the
 US.


>> We
 pretty
 much
 agreed
 that
 I'll
 be
 going


to
 China.


>> When
 is
 that?


>> In
 the
 earlier
 part
 of
 the
 year.


>> Okay.
 and
 presidency
 will
 be
 coming
 into


maybe
 Washington
 or
 Palm
 Beach
 or


someplace
 sometime
 after
 that.


>> So
 if
 the
 reason
 we
 had
 a
 3%
 draw
 down


on
 October
 10th
 was
 because
 of
 the
 China


tweet
 around
 the
 United
 States
 basically


saying
 hey
 China's
 being
 aggressive
 with


rare
 earths
 and
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 buy


their
 soybeans
 yada
 yada
 and
 now
 that


reason
 seems
 to
 be
 all
 but
 not
 as


relevant.
 It
 doesn't
 mean
 we
 have
 a
 deal


yet
 but
 it
 does
 mean
 it
 looks
 like
 we


have
 a
 framework
 for
 a
 deal
 that
 will


result
 in
 something
 friendly.
 I
 mean,


Trump's
 literally
 inviting
 Xi
 to
 the


White
 House.
 I
 really
 I
 don't
 know,


maybe
 I'm
 being
 naive
 about
 it,
 but
 on


no
 November
 1st
 or
 October
 30th
 when


they
 meet
 in
 South
 Korea,
 uh
 Trump
 is
 on


his
 way
 back
 from
 Malaysia
 as
 we
 speak.


I
 think
 he's
 he's
 actually
 went
 to
 Japan


last
 night,
 so
 he
 should
 be
 coming
 back


to
 the
 US
 in
 in
 a
 couple
 days.
 Um
 it's


hard
 for
 me
 to
 believe
 that
 after
 all


these
 productive
 conversations
 that
 Bent


has
 had
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 end
 up


with
 no
 deal,
 especially
 towards
 the
 end


of the
 year.
 Trump
 knows
 the
 midterms


are
 coming
 up.
 Trump
 knows
 this
 is
 the


end
 of
 his
 first
 year
 as
 being


president.
 I
 mean
 you
 want
 to
 get
 some


landmark
 legislation.
 Obviously
 big


beautiful
 bill
 was
 the
 the
 most


important
 thing
 but
 the
 next
 big
 thing


is
 locking
 in
 these
 trade
 deals
 with


China,
 India
 etc.
 We
 already
 have
 Japan,


South
 Korea,
 Europe.
 If
 we
 can
 lock
 it


in
 with
 the
 major
 nations,
 I
 mean
 not


only
 would
 the
 markets
 like
 it,
 but
 that


could
 also
 be
 very
 productive
 for
 the


broader
 health
 of
 the
 economy.
 And
 given


we
 are
 running
 up
 a
 deficit,
 we
 do
 need


the
 trade
 deals
 to
 contribute
 to
 GDP


growth.
 So
 I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 It
 feels


like
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 some
 fun


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 November


tends
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 best
 months
 of


the
 year
 as
 well.
 Uh
 so
 now
 you've
 got


the
 trade
 deal
 catalyst,
 you've
 got
 the


broader
 earnings
 catalyst
 that
 we'll


talk
 about
 in
 a
 second.
 And
 then
 you've


got
 November
 being
 better
 than
 expected.


I
 mean,
 and
 then
 you
 got
 the
 rate
 cuts


coming
 up
 where,
 you
 know,
 there
 is
 a


lot
 of
 money
 on
 the
 sidelines
 at
 the
 end


of the
 day.
 As
 that
 money
 gets
 to
 the


sidelines,
 uh
 you
 know,
 it's
 going
 to


have
 more
 of
 an
 incentive
 to
 potentially


get
 off
 the
 sidelines
 if
 we
 continue
 to


get
 rate
 cuts.
 Seems
 like
 there's
 a


shot.
 Seems
 like
 there's
 a
 shot.
 We


could
 have
 a
 really,
 really
 strong
 end


of
 year.
 And
 it
 looks
 like
 that
 could
 be


what's
 playing
 out
 right
 now.
 So,
 that's


what
 we
 have
 in
 the
 context
 of
 the
 China


updates
 and
 doesn't
 look
 like
 that's


slowing
 down
 at
 all.
 Thank
 you
 again
 for


all
 the
 happy
 birthday
 wishes.
 Deeply,


deeply
 appreciate
 everyone
 for
 the


wishes.
 Your
 boy
 is
 now
 28
 and
 uh
 we're


going
 to
 keep
 working.
 We're
 going
 to


keep
 working
 every
 single
 day
 as
 usual.


All
 right,
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 had
 for


China.
 Let's
 get
 into
 some
 of
 the
 other


stuff
 we
 got
 going
 on.
 First
 of
 all,


Paler,
 uh,
 there
 was
 rumors
 over
 the


weekend
 that
 Pounder
 was
 going to
 be


signing
 a
 letter
 of
 intent
 with
 Poland.


It
 officially
 is
 confirmed.
 Pounder
 just


tweeted,
 "We
 are
 committed
 to
 Poland
 and


proud
 to
 deepen
 our
 partnership
 with
 the


Ministry
 of
 Defense.
 Today's
 agreement


paves
 the
 way
 for
 Pouncer's
 AI
 enabled


defense
 technology
 to
 begin
 rapidly


supporting
 the
 country's
 armed
 forces
 as


they
 innovate
 at
 the
 forefront
 of
 an


increasingly
 complex
 threat
 environment


and
 strengthen
 Poland's
 position
 as
 a


sovereign
 leader
 in
 defense.


Technological
 collaboration
 between


Palier,
 the
 Polish
 armed
 forces,
 the


Polish
 defend
 industry,
 and
 the
 rapidly


growing
 Polish
 defense
 startup
 ecosystem


will
 make
 Poland
 a
 pioneer
 and
 leader
 in


AI
 for
 defense.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 this
 is


really
 exciting
 because
 last
 week
 you


had
 a
 $200
 million
 contract
 with
 Lumen,


which
 is
 another
 commercial
 government


provider
 pounder,
 you
 know,
 really


inching
 a
 multi-year
 partnership.
 The


the
 CEO
 of
 Lumen
 was
 on
 Fox
 Business
 and


said,
 "Alex
 came
 into
 our
 room
 and
 said,


"Don't
 pay
 us
 until
 we
 can
 show
 you
 the


value."
 and
 he
 showed
 us
 the
 value
 and


that's
 why
 we're
 now
 paying
 him
 hundreds


of
 millions
 of
 dollars
 for
 the
 company


software
 and
 it
 looks
 like
 Palantry
 is


taking
 that
 same
 approach
 which
 is
 the


value
 is
 downstream
 from
 actually


showing
 the
 impact
 of
 the
 software
 and


they've
 probably
 shown
 their
 software


over
 the
 past
 couple
 months
 to
 Poland


and
 now
 Poland's
 Ministry
 of
 Defense


wants
 to
 take
 a
 more
 productive
 approach


working
 with
 Palanteer
 makes
 sense
 I


mean
 at
 at
 the
 end of
 the
 day
 with


everything
 going
 on
 in
 Russia
 Ukraine
 a


lot
 of the
 Baltic
 states
 obviously
 want


to
 take
 more
 precautionary
 measures
 has


worked
 with
 many
 of
 them
 including


Lithuania
 And
 it
 looks
 like
 they
 now


have
 an
 official
 partnership
 with


Poland.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 the
 stock
 is
 about


80
 cents
 away
 from
 an
 all-time
 high.
 I


think
 there's
 a
 world
 where
 we
 can
 crack


it.
 We're
 going to
 see
 at
 9:30
 when
 the


market
 opens
 if
 it
 ends
 up
 getting


dumped
 and
 or
 if
 there's
 a
 bit
 of
 u


resistance
 right
 there.
 But
 yeah,
 for


all
 the
 people
 that
 are
 Polish
 in
 the


chat,
 I
 see
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 that
 are


from
 Poland.
 It
 looks
 like
 Pounder
 might


be
 potentially
 uh
 powering
 the
 entire


operating
 system
 for
 the
 Ministry
 of


Defense.
 So
 very
 very
 exciting
 for


Pounder
 and
 it
 looks
 like
 that
 is


another
 good
 deal.
 Uh
 Robin
 Hood,
 we
 got


an
 upgrade
 on
 Robin
 Hood
 161
 for
 Hoodie.


Uh
 and
 the
 reason
 we
 got
 161
 is
 because


of
 earnings
 updates.
 So
 you've
 got


Compass
 Point.
 They
 raised
 their
 price


target
 from
 105
 to
 161.
 And
 here's
 what


they
 said.
 Our
 3Qbida
 forecast
 is
 6%


above
 the
 street
 and
 we
 expect
 Hood
 to


disclose
 October
 trends
 pacing
 well


above
 fourth
 quarter
 expectations.
 If
 we


annualize
 our
 forecast,
 transaction


revenue
 is
 only
 2%
 below
 consensus
 for


2026.
 Fourth
 quarter
 offers
 additional


upside
 quarter
 quarter
 alongside
 higher


prediction
 market
 volumes,
 crypto
 fee


pricing,
 and
 staking
 revenue.
 Staking
 is


one
 of
 those
 things
 that's
 not
 really


baked
 into
 a
 lot
 of
 analysts
 assumptions


yet.
 While
 Hood
 trades
 at
 a
 premium
 of


62x
 or
 2026
 EPS
 and
 43xida,
 we're


comfortable
 with
 our
 buy
 rating
 as
 long


as
 revenue
 EBIDA
 continue
 to
 exceed


expectations.
 We
 increase
 our
 price


target
 to
 161.
 Our
 2026
 EPS
 is
 7%
 above


the
 street
 with
 a
 meaningful
 room
 for


upside
 if
 recent
 trends
 persist.
 Very


nice
 to
 see
 that
 you're
 getting
 another


price
 target
 from
 Robin
 Hood,
 especially


going
 into
 2026.
 One
 of
 the
 concerns
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 with
 Hood
 is


that
 if
 we
 do
 end
 up
 in
 a
 crypto
 winter,


if
 we
 end
 up
 in
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 not


a
 bearish
 market,
 but
 a
 lack
 of
 volatile


market
 to
 the
 upside,
 Hood's
 transaction


volumes
 won't
 be
 as
 strong.
 Bitcoin


right
 there
 115,
 Ethereum
 above
 4,100.


If
 that
 doesn't
 happen
 in
 2026,
 and
 I'm


sure
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 some
 draw
 downs


in
 2026
 of
 10%
 15%
 that
 just
 tends
 to


happen
 every
 single
 year.
 But
 if
 the


broader
 trend
 is
 intact
 and
 you
 know


maybe
 we
 end
 out
 the
 year
 7,000
 maybe
 we


are
 much
 closer
 to
 8,000
 by
 2026
 then


Robinet's
 probably
 going to
 be
 a
 pivotal


player
 and
 those
 prediction
 markets
 are


also
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 very
 very


important
 for
 the
 company
 to
 continue
 to


do
 well.
 So
 you're
 getting
 some


excitement
 right
 there
 from
 uh
 or


excitement
 right
 there
 from
 Robin
 Hood


and
 that's
 also
 leading
 to
 some
 of
 that


pre-market
 action.
 I
 mean
 look
 if
 we
 see


150
 it
 would
 be
 very
 exciting.
 I
 do


think
 this
 150
 run
 would
 be
 a
 bit
 more


healthier
 and
 it's
 not
 just
 for
 Robin


Hood.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 stocks,


including
 a
 Nebus
 that
 took
 a
 nasty
 hit


from
 140
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to
 96,
 Robin


Hood
 from
 150
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to
 120,


the
 fact
 that
 they're
 now
 gapping
 back


up
 even
 though
 they're
 not
 fully
 at
 all


time
 highs
 is
 very
 healthy
 because
 the


market
 got
 a
 lot
 of the
 froth
 out
 of
 the


system.
 So,
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 sellers


to
 leave,
 which
 is
 good.
 Uh,
 and
 then


number
 two,
 uh,
 you
 have
 earnings
 coming


up.
 So,
 if
 Nebus
 and
 Hood
 can
 crush


earnings,
 which
 I
 think
 they
 will,
 they


not
 starting
 at
 all-time
 highs
 in
 terms


of
 making
 a
 move
 higher.
 are
 starting
 at


levels
 that
 are
 depressed
 from
 all-time


highs,
 which
 actually
 makes
 it
 easier
 to


get
 to
 new
 all-time
 highs.
 It
 just
 just,


you
 know,
 historically
 when
 you
 look
 at


the
 market,
 you
 need
 to
 have
 a
 little


bit
 of
 pain
 before
 you
 have
 some
 gain.


So,
 I
 think
 across
 the
 entire
 board,


it's
 it's
 a
 much
 healthier
 way
 to
 get


into
 into
 the
 earning
 season.
 And


obviously,
 those
 who
 took
 advantage
 of


the
 dip
 have
 also
 benefited
 from
 that
 as


well.
 So,
 very
 nice
 to
 see
 what's
 going


on
 in
 the
 context
 of
 some
 of
 those


growth
 stocks
 as
 well.
 All right,
 so


that's
 what
 you
 had
 on
 Robin
 Hood.
 And


now
 let's
 transition
 over
 to
 a
 couple
 of


other
 updates
 we
 have
 right
 here
 in
 the


context
 of
 crypto.
 So
 first
 of
 bit
 mine


uh
 Tom
 Lee
 bought
 the
 dip


didn't
 buy
 as
 much
 as
 a
 lot
 of
 people


expected
 but
 he
 did
 buy
 3.31
 million.


They
 bought
 about
 73,000
 Ethereum
 or


77,000
 Ethereum
 over
 the
 weekend.
 He


says
 the
 progress
 and
 trade
 talks


between
 the
 US
 and
 China
 is
 positive
 for


Ethereum
 and
 crypto
 broadly.
 These
 are


global
 assets
 and
 rising
 tensions


triggered
 the
 largest
 ever
 deleveraging


crypto
 event
 over
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago.
 While


the
 fundamentals
 of
 Ethereum
 and
 crypto


are
 uncorrelated
 to
 equities,
 Funstrap


work
 has
 shown
 that
 in
 the
 past
 15


years,
 Ethereum
 and
 crypto
 perform


better
 when
 equities
 rise.
 Meaning


crypto
 is
 correlated
 to
 risk
 on
 assets


via
 the
 associated
 leverage
 channel.
 So


you've
 got
 Bitmine
 that
 now
 owns
 2.8%


of
 the
 entire
 asset
 class
 when
 it
 comes


to
 Ethereum.
 Bitmine
 right
 there
 at


5310.
 That's
 up
 5.3%.
 I
 mean
 Ethereum


finally
 breaking
 above
 4,000.
 It
 was


stuck
 at
 37
 to
 3,900
 basically
 for
 the


past
 2
 weeks.
 question
 now
 is
 if
 this


bad
 boy
 can
 gap
 up
 to
 5,000
 towards
 the


end
 of
 November.
 And
 I'm
 optimistic
 that


it
 can.
 I
 don't
 know if
 we
 have
 that


10,000
 level
 baked
 into
 it.
 By
 the
 way,


Bitcoin
 uh
 if
 it
 just
 closes
 at
 this


level,
 we
 will
 have
 October
 continue
 to


be
 intact,
 which
 is
 essentially
 a
 um
 as


you
 can
 see
 right
 here,
 description
 of


how
 many
 times
 we've
 had
 a
 green


October.


Last
 eight
 October
 were
 green.
 So,
 if
 we


can
 continue,
 even
 if
 we
 entered
 up
 by


1.2%.


It
 would
 be
 nice.
 Why
 do
 you
 think


Bitmine
 didn't
 buy
 more?
 ETH
 was
 under


4K
 for
 a
 week.
 Yeah,
 I'm
 not
 fully
 sure.


I
 mean,
 maybe
 they
 were
 just
 being
 a


little
 bit
 more
 hesitant
 because
 they


thought
 if
 the
 China
 trade
 negotiations


didn't
 go
 that
 well
 that
 Ethereum
 would


tank
 to
 like
 3,200
 and
 that's
 where
 they


could
 get
 a
 better
 price,
 which
 is
 a


fair
 riskreward
 assessment
 to
 make.
 It's


like,
 hey,
 maybe,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 the


China
 stuff
 is
 more
 of
 a
 um
 headwind
 and


we
 need
 to
 be
 cautious.
 And
 so
 they


bought
 as
 much
 as
 they
 could
 but
 not


enough
 to
 the
 point
 where
 they
 would


essentially
 spend
 all
 the
 cash
 that
 they


had
 which
 I
 think
 is
 fair
 to
 do.
 But
 uh


you
 do
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 treasuries


continuing
 to
 buy
 more.
 I
 mean
 even


Micro
 Strategy
 today,
 Micro
 Strategy


bought
 more.
 It
 has
 been
 a
 while
 since


they
 bought
 as
 much
 as
 they
 did
 but
 390


Bitcoin
 43.4
 million
 is
 what
 Mr.
 Sailor


purchased
 today.
 111,000
 per
 Bitcoin
 and


uh
 now
 their
 average
 is
 74,000.


So
 you
 have
 the
 best
 DATs
 that
 are
 able


to
 continue
 diluting
 at
 a
 premium


continuing
 to
 buy
 as
 much
 Bitcoin
 as


they
 have


which
 is
 very
 exciting
 for
 the
 crypto


ecosystem
 as
 well.
 Yeah,
 we
 have
 a
 lot


of
 uh
 Polish
 people
 in
 the
 chat.
 I
 love


it.
 All
 right,
 we
 got
 to
 visit
 Poland.


We
 got
 to
 visit
 Poland
 hopefully
 going


into


going
 into
 2026.
 So
 that's
 what
 you
 got


for
 MSTR
 again.
 pre-markets.
 Got
 Bitcoin


right
 there
 at
 115.
 MSTR,
 I
 think,


potentially
 above
 300.
 29972.
 It's
 not


fully
 above
 300,
 but
 trying
 to
 get
 there


and
 at least
 above
 that
 270
 level
 that


it
 kind
 of
 bottomed
 at
 going
 into
 last


week.
 Uh,
 and
 that's
 what
 you
 have
 on


Bitcoin.
 All right,
 some
 other
 clips
 in


regards
 to
 some
 of
 the
 things
 that
 Trump


has
 said.
 First
 of
 all,
 uh,
 Trump
 and


Elon,
 he
 actually
 gave
 some
 comments


this
 morning
 about
 Elon
 Musk.


>> How
 is
 your
 relationship
 with
 Elon
 these


days?


I
 think
 it's
 good.
 I
 mean,
 you
 saw
 that


during
 Charlie's
 beautiful
 tribute,
 Elon


came
 up.
 It's
 good
 with
 Elon.
 I
 like


Elon.
 I've
 always
 liked
 Elon.
 Elon's


good.


>> Have
 you
 talked
 to
 him
 since
 the


memorial?


>> Uh,


on
 and
 off
 a
 little
 bit.
 Yeah.
 Very


little.
 Nothing
 much.
 Look,
 he's
 a
 nice


guy
 and
 he's
 a
 very
 capable
 guy.
 Uh,


I've
 always
 liked
 him.
 He
 had
 a
 bad


spell.
 He
 had
 a
 bad
 period.
 He
 had
 a
 bad


moment.
 It
 was
 a
 stupid
 moment
 in
 his


life.
 very
 stupid.
 I'm
 sure
 I'm
 sure


he'd
 tell
 you
 that.
 But
 uh
 I
 like
 Elon


and
 I
 suspect
 I'll
 always
 like
 him.


>> I
 mean,
 look,
 that's
 good
 to
 see
 if


you're
 a
 Tesla
 shareholder
 because
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 we
 can't
 forget


Tesla
 still
 needs
 legislation
 over
 the


next
 four
 years
 that's
 going
 to
 be


conducive
 to
 what
 they're
 doing
 with


self-driving
 and
 probably
 also
 conducive


to
 what
 they're
 going to
 be
 doing
 with


robotics.
 So
 you
 need
 some
 level
 of


meaningful
 uh
 cooperation
 from
 the


administration
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 Elon


and
 Trump
 potentially
 are
 uh
 recovering


from
 some
 of
 the
 strains
 in
 the


relationship.
 That
 is
 also
 not
 the
 worst


thing
 to
 see.
 Tesla
 stock
 right
 there
 up


about
 1%
 in
 the
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 as


well.
 Um
 so
 good
 to
 see
 that
 in
 the


context
 of
 Tesla.
 We
 have
 some
 other


updates
 right
 here
 that
 also
 are


potentially
 implicating
 what
 we've
 got


with
 Trump.
 Japan's
 new
 prime
 minister,


one
 of
 the
 first
 female
 prime
 ministers


of
 the
 country,
 is
 considering
 buying


around
 a
 100
 Ford
 F-150s
 for
 government


use
 as
 a
 goodwill
 move
 before
 Trump's


visit,
 which
 Trump
 was
 visiting
 last


night.
 Trump
 praised
 the
 plan
 aboard
 Air


Force
 One,
 calling
 the
 F-150
 a
 hot
 truck


and
 saying
 that
 the
 PM
 has
 good
 taste.


So,
 you're
 already
 getting
 some
 more
 of


these
 global
 leaders
 saying,
 "Hey,
 let's


find
 a
 way
 to
 warm
 up
 to
 Trump
 and
 let's


uh
 do
 something
 that
 can
 create
 the


negotiations
 in
 a
 meaningful
 way."
 I


mean,
 you
 saw
 what
 happened
 with
 Canada


over
 the
 weekend.
 Obviously,
 the
 some
 of


them
 stopped
 playing
 the
 ad
 and
 uh
 you


know,
 Canada
 essentially
 Trump
 said,


"We're
 going
 to
 increase
 the
 tariffs
 by


10%
 on
 Saturday."
 Market
 kind
 of
 didn't


care
 too
 much
 about
 that.
 They
 cared


more
 about
 the
 China
 stuff,
 but
 Bent


commented
 on
 China
 and
 or
 commented
 on


Canada
 and
 basically
 said
 they
 were


really
 stupid
 to
 do
 what
 they
 did.
 And


he
 got
 Canada
 kind
 of
 capitulating
 to


the
 opposite
 direction
 by
 saying,
 "All


right,
 it
 looks
 like
 we're
 going
 to
 have


to
 negotiate
 here."
 major
 trade
 issue


which
 is
 Canada.
 Of
 course,
 this
 week,


President
 Trump
 abruptly
 broke
 off
 trade


talks
 with
 uh
 Canada
 and
 put
 another
 10%


tariff
 on
 Canada
 in
 response
 to
 an
 ad


that
 the
 government
 of
 Ontario
 ran.
 It


features
 former
 President
 Ronald
 Reagan.


Why
 is
 the
 president
 setting
 trade


policy
 based
 on
 a
 television
 ad
 he


doesn't
 like?


Uh
 well,
 Kristen,
 let's
 let's
 think


about
 this.
 This
 this
 is
 a
 kind
 of


propaganda
 against
 US
 citizens.
 You


know,
 it
 it's
 it's
 scops.
 Why
 why
 would


the
 government
 of
 Ontario,
 I'm
 told,


that
 they've
 spent
 they
 have
 spent
 or


were
 planning
 to
 spend
 up
 to
 $75
 million


on
 these
 ads
 that
 come
 across
 the
 US


border.
 So
 what
 what
 was
 the
 purpose
 of


that
 other other
 than
 to
 sway
 public


opinion
 and
 you
 know
 it's
 some
 kind
 of


propaganda
 that
 the
 premier
 of
 Ontario


unilaterally
 launched.


>> Will
 will
 the
 10%
 tariffs
 apply
 to
 all


Canadian
 goods?
 Mr.
 Secretary,


>> uh
 Kristen,
 I
 I've
 been
 traveling
 since


this
 unfortunate
 event
 happened.
 I
 know


that
 the
 ad's
 been
 taken
 down.
 So,
 you


know,
 we
 we'll
 have
 to
 see,
 but
 I
 I
 just


think
 it
 was
 ter
 terrible,
 terrible


judgment
 by
 by
 this
 premier,
 you
 know,


who
 has
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 reputation
 for
 being


a
 hothead.


>> Does
 the
 president
 know
 if
 the
 tariffs


will
 apply
 to
 10%
 tariffs
 will
 apply
 to


all
 Canadian
 goods?
 Has
 he
 made
 a


determination
 about
 that?


Well,


uh,
 well,
 I
 I'm
 sure
 he
 I'm
 sure
 he


knows
 and
 I'm
 sure
 the
 ambassador
 Greer,


uh,
 knows,
 but
 again,
 you
 know,
 we're


we're
 here
 out
 in
 Asia
 and
 we're
 doing


these
 big
 trade
 deals
 out
 in
 Asia
 that


we
 just
 signed
 the
 Malaysian
 deal
 today,


which
 was
 fantastic.
 And,
 you
 know,
 I've


been
 spending
 the
 past
 two
 days


negotiating
 with
 the
 Chinese.
 So
 you


know
 what's
 whatever
 is
 going
 on
 back
 in


North
 America
 I
 think
 is
 the
 taking


second
 fiddle
 to
 President
 Trump's


leadership
 out
 here
 in
 the
 Pacific.


>> So
 the
 markets
 didn't
 care
 too
 much


about
 that
 Canada
 10%
 tariff.
 I
 imagine


Trump
 will
 either
 get
 rid
 of
 it
 or
 use


it
 as
 a
 form
 of
 leverage
 and


negotiation.
 But
 the
 one
 thing
 I
 will


say
 on
 this
 and
 and
 this
 is
 what
 I
 said


kind
 of
 on
 Friday.
 Um,
 I
 don't
 think


we've
 ever
 seen
 a
 president
 of
 the


United
 States
 use
 the
 leverage
 of
 being


the
 president
 of
 the
 United
 States
 like


we've
 seen
 Trump
 use
 it.
 And
 and
 whether


you
 like
 it
 or
 hate
 it
 is
 a
 different


question,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 any


diplomatic
 uh
 consultant
 would
 say
 in


the
 middle
 of
 the
 night
 you
 should
 tweet


that
 you're
 putting
 a
 10%
 tariff
 on


Canada
 and
 that
 all
 trade
 negotiations


are
 officially
 terminated
 based
 on


seeing
 an
 advertisement.
 Right?
 You


know,
 most
 diplomatic
 consultants
 would


tell
 you,
 "Hey,
 that's
 not
 the
 right
 way


to
 approach
 it."
 Trump
 has
 just
 not


cared.
 He's
 not
 cared
 whether
 it's


China,
 Canada,
 South
 Korea,
 whatever


he's
 going
 to
 say,
 he's
 just
 going
 to


publicly
 say
 it
 to
 the
 people.
 He's
 not


going
 to
 go
 through
 an
 inter


intermediary
 or
 a
 middleman.
 He's
 just


going
 to
 directly
 post
 it.
 Everyone's


going
 to
 consume
 it.
 The
 world's
 going


to
 react.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 chaotic.
 And


then
 from
 that
 chaos,
 there
 is


potentially
 some
 bright
 side
 uh
 or


bright
 line
 when
 you
 get
 to
 the
 other


side.
 And
 so
 far,
 in
 some
 instances,
 it


has
 not
 worked,
 but
 in
 other
 instances,


it
 has
 worked
 because
 you
 just
 go
 so


direct
 and
 you
 cut
 through
 all
 the
 BS


and
 you
 use
 the
 leverage
 of
 saying,
 "Oh,


we're
 the
 United
 States.
 If
 you're
 not


going
 to
 export
 rare
 earths
 to
 us,
 then


we
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 business
 with
 you
 at


all.
 If
 you're
 going
 to
 run
 these


commercials
 that,
 in
 the
 words
 of


Ascent,
 operate
 as
 a
 SCOP,
 then
 we
 are


done
 talking
 to
 you."
 And
 like
 the
 other


side,
 because
 they
 need
 the
 US
 because


we
 are
 the
 large
 consumer
 of
 everything


ends
 up
 having
 to
 capitulate
 at least
 to


an
 extent.
 And
 if
 it
 doesn't
 fully
 solve


the
 issue,
 it
 maybe
 gets
 you
 closer
 to
 a


deal.
 Whether
 you
 like
 the
 tactic
 or


not,
 it
 is
 a
 tactic
 that
 I
 don't
 think


any
 other
 president
 in
 the
 history
 of


America
 has
 used
 to
 the
 extent
 that


Trump
 has
 used
 it.
 And
 the
 question
 is


just,
 you
 know,
 is
 that
 going
 to
 be
 a


tactic
 that
 fully
 works
 over
 the
 long


term?
 We're
 going
 to
 see,
 but
 so
 far
 you


are
 getting
 some
 effects
 based
 on
 how
 I


guess
 chaotic
 the
 diplomacy
 is.
 And


potentially
 those
 effects
 are
 more


positive
 than
 not.
 macro.
 Let's
 talk


about
 some
 of
 the
 macro.
 Here's
 what
 we


got.
 So,
 after
 next
 week,
 seasonality


starts
 to
 look
 really
 bad
 for
 the
 bears.


This
 is
 the
 S&P
 500
 index
 based
 on
 a


seasonal
 uh
 perspective.
 And
 as
 you're


seeing
 right
 there,
 this
 is
 when
 it's
 a


little
 choppy.
 Around
 that
 October
 to


early
 November
 time
 after
 next
 week,
 aka


towards
 the
 next
 week
 or
 to
 towards
 the


first
 week
 of
 November,
 you
 start
 to
 get


some
 upside.
 You
 start
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 more


upside.
 and
 that
 upside
 tends
 to
 be
 uh
 a


bit
 more
 aggressive.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 if
 you


are
 a
 bear
 going
 into
 November
 and


December,
 you've
 got
 I
 mean,
 first
 of


all,
 if
 you've
 been
 a
 bear
 all
 year,


you've
 had
 like
 one
 option
 to
 to
 kind
 of


to
 to
 to
 capitalize
 on
 the
 bearishness


if
 you
 had
 shorts
 or
 anything
 like
 that.


And
 that
 was
 April.
 And
 that
 was
 a
 very


shortterm
 moment
 that
 you
 had
 to
 be
 able


to
 capitalize
 on
 it.
 Uh
 because
 then
 it


ended
 up
 being
 about
 the
 dip.
 And
 you


had
 some
 dips
 in
 between
 that.
 The
 the


biggest
 was
 the
 3%
 draw
 down
 on
 October


10th.
 And
 now
 that
 that's
 kind
 of
 been


recovered,
 you
 got
 to
 really
 ask


yourself
 where
 are
 those
 opportunities


coming?
 And
 it
 doesn't
 look
 like
 it's


going
 to
 come
 in
 November,
 December.


Unless
 something
 really
 bad
 happens
 in


the
 macro,
 labor
 market,
 Trump
 trade


deals,
 etc.
 Rate
 cuts
 are
 probably
 not


going to
 play
 a
 factor
 into
 that.
 Maybe


earnings
 really
 disappoint,
 but
 it
 seems


like
 so
 far
 earnings
 have
 been
 pretty


good.
 So
 what
 is
 the
 bare
 case
 going


into
 the
 last
 two
 months
 of
 the
 year?


Government
 shutdown
 potentially
 is
 a


tailwind
 when
 we
 reopen,
 but
 even
 if
 we


continue
 to
 be
 shut
 down,
 the
 markets


have
 not
 seemed
 to
 care.
 So,
 it
 does


look
 like
 there
 is
 some
 real
 strong


positive
 momentum
 going
 in
 towards
 the


end
 of
 the
 year
 and
 you
 know
 that
 might


not
 be
 easily


slowing
 down.
 On
 top
 of
 that,
 take
 a


look
 at
 this.
 The
 NASDAQ
 is
 on
 track
 to


be
 up
 seven
 months
 in
 a
 row.
 And
 if
 you


look
 at
 this
 chart,
 when
 the
 NASDAQ
 is


up
 at
 least
 seven
 months
 in
 a
 row,
 on


average,
 one
 year
 later,
 stock
 market's


up
 13%.
 100%
 of
 the
 time.
 So
 when
 you


have
 that
 consecutive
 run
 of
 tech
 stocks


the
 way
 that
 the
 NASDAQ
 is
 running,
 it


does
 signal
 that
 it
 likely
 means
 we
 are


going
 higher
 over
 the
 long
 term
 and
 if


the
 earnings
 picture
 continues
 to
 be
 as


strong
 as
 it's
 been,
 it
 looks
 like
 that


doesn't
 have
 to
 slow
 down.
 On
 top
 of


that,
 I
 showed
 this
 chart
 last
 week,
 but


important
 to
 serve
 as
 a
 reminder,
 the


cash
 level
 for
 the
 average
 institutional


investor,
 this
 was
 based
 on
 a
 Bank
 of


America
 survey
 of
 fund
 managers,
 is
 at


3.8%.


you
 have
 a
 significant
 level
 of
 fund


managers
 reducing
 their
 cash
 balance,


which
 one
 could
 say
 is
 a
 little
 toppy


because
 that
 means
 there's
 not
 that
 much


cash
 on
 sidelines.
 Another
 person
 can


say,
 well,
 a
 lot
 of that
 money
 is
 being


deployed
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 fund
 managers


that
 are
 chasing
 performance
 because


they
 haven't
 performed
 this
 year
 because


they
 weren't
 effectively
 buying
 the
 dip


on
 certain
 levels.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you're
 a


fund
 manager
 and
 you
 miss
 the
 dip
 in


April
 and
 then
 you
 miss
 the
 dip
 again
 on


October
 10th,
 I
 mean,
 you
 really
 got
 to


be
 annoyed
 at
 yourself
 and
 you
 probably


have
 no
 choice
 but
 to
 either
 stay
 in


cash
 and
 just
 accept
 that
 you're
 going


to
 underperform
 the
 market
 this
 year,


which
 then
 begs
 the
 question,
 why
 do
 you


even
 manage
 funds
 in
 the
 first
 place?


And
 that's
 a
 existential
 question
 for
 a


lot
 of these
 fund
 managers
 because


literally
 their,
 you
 know,
 business,


their
 livelihood
 depends
 on
 it.
 Or
 do


you
 chase?
 And
 if
 you
 have
 to
 chase,


then
 that
 just
 creates
 a
 meltup.
 And


this
 meltup
 is
 now
 aided
 with
 rate
 cuts,


which
 again
 continues
 to
 to
 add
 more


value
 to
 the
 bullcase.
 Unless
 you
 think


there's
 another
 dip
 coming,
 which
 maybe


there
 is,
 but
 if
 we
 just
 had
 a
 draw


down,
 maybe
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 have


another
 uh
 another
 3%
 draw
 down.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 that's
 kind
 of
 what
 I
 wrote


up
 last
 night
 as
 well.
 I
 mean,
 we
 are


cutting
 rates
 into
 a
 market
 that's
 at


all-time
 highs
 and
 putting
 up
 double


digit
 earnings
 growth.
 So,
 we
 just
 had
 a


3%
 draw
 down.
 The
 reason
 for
 that
 draw


down
 was
 because
 of
 China.
 That
 seems
 to


be
 going
 away.
 More
 geopolitical
 peace


around
 the
 world
 is
 a
 tailwind.


Potential
 ceasefire
 with
 Russ
 Ukraine


could
 be
 a
 tailwind.
 Earnings
 have
 been


incredible
 so
 far.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 of


earnings
 coming
 up
 this
 week
 that


hopefully
 continues
 it.
 AI
 capex
 not


slowing
 down.
 Big
 tech
 companies


producing
 monster
 numbers
 only


reinforces
 why
 they're
 spending
 so
 much


on
 capex.
 You
 still
 have
 seven
 half


trillion
 dollars
 on
 the
 sidelines.
 Not


all
 of
 it's
 going to
 come
 into
 the


equity
 markets,
 but
 even
 if
 a
 couple


hundred
 billion,
 remember
 the
 money


market
 funds
 on
 average
 for
 the
 past
 15


years
 have
 had
 three
 trillion
 on
 the


sidelines.
 COVID
 is
 what
 created
 that


extra
 four
 trillion
 that
 was
 added
 to


it.
 We
 don't
 need
 to
 have
 that
 four


trillion
 come
 out,
 but
 if
 you
 have
 a


couple
 hundred
 billion
 come
 out,
 that's


still
 a
 massive
 tailwind
 for
 the
 broader


economy.
 Government
 reopening
 will
 be


good.
 And
 then
 Nvidia
 might
 have
 a


internal
 tailwind
 by
 being
 able
 to
 sell


to
 China
 soon
 if
 that
 is
 negotiated
 from


this
 trade
 deal,
 which
 is
 a
 massive


bullcase
 for
 all
 the
 semiconductor
 names


because
 if
 Nvidia
 is
 able
 to
 sell
 more


GPUs,
 Micron,
 SMCI,
 they
 will
 get
 more


business.


And
 so
 there's
 things
 to
 be
 concerned


about
 like
 the
 labor
 market.
 There's


definitely
 issues
 out
 there
 in
 the


economy
 that
 we
 can't
 ignore,
 but
 the


broader
 trend
 just
 seems
 to
 be
 more


bullish
 than
 not.
 And
 that
 is
 that
 is


very
 exciting
 to
 see
 as
 we
 head
 into
 the


end
 of
 the
 year.
 Matt
 Money,
 thank
 you


for
 being
 here,
 brother.
 Thank
 you
 for


the
 happy
 birthday
 wish.
 Again,
 I'll


I'll
 read
 all
 the
 super
 chats
 as
 we
 get


towards
 the
 uh
 the
 end
 of
 the
 show,
 but


Matt,
 appreciate
 you,
 man.
 Been
 awesome


to
 be
 on
 the
 journey
 with
 you
 over
 the


past
 couple
 years,
 and
 thank
 you,
 sir,


for
 the
 happy
 birthday
 wishes.


Um,


is
 chasing
 SoFi
 smart
 today?
 You
 know,


SoFi's
 at
 30
 bucks.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 the


number
 that's
 been
 going
 around
 in
 my


opinion
 from
 what
 I've
 seen
 anecdotally


is
 35.
 That's
 what
 I
 feel
 like
 most


people
 are
 aiming
 for
 after
 this


earnings.
 I
 kind
 of
 think
 everyone's


getting
 super
 bullish
 and
 that's
 not


maybe
 the
 best
 thing
 in
 the
 world.
 Maybe


it
 disappoints.
 But
 even
 if
 you,
 you


know,
 take
 away
 that
 perspective
 from


it,
 which
 is
 like,
 you
 know,
 the
 herd


being
 in
 one
 direction,
 therefore
 the


stock
 would
 go
 the
 other
 in
 the
 other


direction.
 Look
 at
 the
 fundamentals.
 All


the
 banks
 have
 crushed.
 So
 far
 as
 a


bank,
 they're
 going to
 crush.
 Their


provision
 for
 credit
 loss
 is
 probably


going
 to
 come
 better
 than
 expected.


Their
 EPS
 is
 likely
 going
 to
 beat


because
 not
 been
 beating
 consecutively.


I
 mean,
 the
 street's
 expecting
 30%


growth.
 If
 they
 come
 in
 anywhere
 near


anywhere
 near
 35
 or
 40%,
 that's
 going
 to


be
 massive.
 And
 then
 rates
 are
 coming


down
 the
 day
 after
 they
 have
 earnings.


So,
 you've
 got
 the
 earnings
 tailwind
 and


then
 you've
 got
 rates
 coming
 down,
 which


should
 be
 another
 tailwind
 in
 general


for
 refinancing.
 I
 mean,
 like,
 I
 I


personally
 could
 see
 SoFi
 gapping
 down


to
 25
 just
 because
 it's
 SoFi
 and
 it


tends
 to
 do
 that
 after
 earnings.
 But
 if


there
 was
 one
 quarter
 where
 the


narrative
 could
 really
 be
 rerated
 and


changed,
 I
 think
 it's
 this
 quarter.
 And


the
 fact
 that
 it's
 only
 been
 stuck


around
 28
 to
 30
 and
 it
 hasn't
 really


gapped
 up,
 I
 think
 it's
 actually


potentially
 giving
 you
 the
 move
 that


people
 are
 looking
 for
 going
 into
 into


tomorrow.


So,
 in
 short,
 no,
 I
 don't
 think
 chasing


soi
 is
 crazy,
 but
 you
 got
 to
 be
 ready
 to


DCA.
 Also,
 like
 look,
 if
 if
 you
 have


SoFi
 and
 you
 and
 and
 it
 falls
 to
 25,


like
 yeah,
 it
 sucks
 if
 you
 bought
 at
 30,


falls
 at
 25,
 but
 this
 is
 a
 high
 quality


company.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 not
 that
 scary
 to


buy
 the
 dip
 on
 SoFi.


So,


you
 could
 always
 sell
 some
 calls
 against


it.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 the
 worst
 thing


in
 the
 world
 to
 to
 have
 this
 one.


Uh,
 very
 cool,
 very
 cool
 what
 we're


seeing
 right
 here
 on
 SoFi.
 $30
 right


here.
 Nvidia
 190
 S&P
 at
 682.
 Thank
 you


to
 my
 uncle
 in
 the
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday,


Aid.
 Wishing
 you
 a
 wonderful
 year
 ahead.


We
 can't
 say
 enough
 of
 how
 blessed
 we


are
 to
 see
 your
 growth
 and
 journey.


Here's
 to
 one
 year
 of
 continued
 success.


Appreciate
 you,
 Money
 Mama.
 Thank
 you


for
 being
 here,
 being
 part
 of
 the
 chat.


Did
 Matt
 Money
 just
 give
 some


memberships?
 Matt
 Money,
 thank
 you
 for


the
 gift
 to
 20.
 Appreciate
 you,
 brother.


20
 of
 you
 guys
 just
 got
 gifted
 a


membership
 by
 Mr.
 Matt
 Money,


thank
 you
 guys
 again.
 It
 really,
 really,


really
 means
 a
 lot.
 And
 uh
 very,
 very


blessed
 to
 be
 spending
 20
 years
 of
 life


with
 all
 you
 guys.
 And
 thank
 you
 to
 my


uncle
 being
 in
 the
 chat.
 It
 was
 so


funny.
 my
 my
 uncle's
 wife,
 my
 aunt,
 she


was
 watching
 the
 show
 the
 other
 day
 and


I
 was
 biting
 on
 my
 hoodie
 string
 and
 she


was
 like,
 "Is
 he
 hungry?
 Is
 he
 like
 is


he
 just
 like
 did
 he
 not
 eat
 lunch
 or


something?"
 And
 I
 was
 like


I
 was
 like,
 "No,
 I
 just,
 you
 know,
 like


I
 don't
 have
 a
 mom
 to
 cook
 for
 me


anymore.
 So
 like
 what
 do
 I
 got
 to
 eat
 my


hoodie
 string?
 That's
 all
 I
 got.
 That's


all
 I
 got."
 So
 there
 we
 go.
 All
 right,


we
 got
 four
 minutes
 until
 this
 market


opens.
 Four
 minutes.
 What
 did
 you
 guys


say
 in
 the
 chat?
 Are
 we
 red
 or
 green?


92%
 of
 people
 say
 green.
 All right,


we're
 bowled
 up.
 We
 are
 bowled
 up
 today


and
 I'm
 bowled
 up
 as
 well.
 If
 you
 if
 you


can
 notice
 the
 the the
 background's
 a


little
 bit
 different
 as
 well.
 I
 moved


everything
 up
 and
 we
 moved
 the
 camera


back.
 So
 now
 there's
 a
 little
 bit
 of


scale
 factor
 here.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 more


stuff
 on
 the
 walls
 and
 uh
 it's
 not
 as


cramped
 as
 it
 was
 before.
 So
 kind
 of


made
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 change
 in
 the


studio
 and
 we'll
 we'll
 keep
 working
 on


making
 it
 better.
 But


I'm
 excited.
 I'm
 excited
 to
 see
 how
 this


market
 can
 open
 up.
 Now
 again,
 it
 would


not
 surprise
 me
 if
 we
 get
 a
 bit
 of
 a


sell
 the
 news
 as
 soon
 as
 the
 market


opens.
 Wow,
 S&P
 683,
 but
 it
 also
 would


not
 surprise
 me
 if
 we
 melt
 up
 because


again,
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 that's


asking
 themselves,
 okay,
 earnings
 are


good.
 Trump
 stuff
 is
 probably
 resolved


and
 rates
 are
 coming
 down.
 What
 do
 I
 do


with
 my
 money?
 Whether
 or
 not
 you
 think


that
 results
 in
 an
 acid
 bubble,
 which


there
 is
 a,
 you
 know,
 decent
 shot
 in


2026
 if
 things
 get
 crazy
 that
 there
 is


some
 level
 of
 an
 acid
 bubble.
 You
 know


the
 what
 the
 drunken
 quote
 which
 I'm


going
 to
 butcher
 here
 is
 always
 like
 you


know
 when
 I
 see
 a
 bubble
 I
 run
 to
 to
 to


jump
 into
 it
 to
 make
 money
 before
 before


I
 stay
 on
 the
 sidelines.
 I
 totally


messed
 up
 that
 quote
 but
 the
 point
 is
 if


you
 see
 a
 bubble
 you
 run
 into
 it.
 Or


maybe
 it
 was
 George
 Soros
 who
 said
 it.


And
 I'm
 not
 saying
 this
 is
 a
 bubble
 by


any
 sense
 of the
 imagination.
 I'm
 saying


if
 we
 have
 rates
 that
 get
 that
 low
 you


could
 definitely
 get
 some
 artificial


valuations.
 But
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 the


earnings
 for
 some
 of
 the
 most
 important


companies
 in
 the
 world
 aren't
 supporting


the
 multiple
 expansion.
 Nvidia
 is
 still


lower
 of
 a
 multiple
 than
 freaking


freaking
 Walmart
 and
 Costco
 if
 you
 look


at
 their
 forward
 2027
 estimates
 which


makes
 no
 sense.


So
 it
 was
 deaf
 Soros.
 Yeah,
 it
 was


definitely
 Soros
 about
 the
 bubble
 quote.


And
 so
 it's
 just
 the
 question
 of
 do
 you


want
 to
 see
 your
 money
 on
 the
 sidelines


when
 something
 like
 that
 is
 happening?


Yeah,
 it's
 when
 I
 see
 a
 bubble
 forming
 I


rush
 in
 to
 buy
 adding
 fuel
 to
 the
 fire


that
 is
 not
 irrational.


Not
 saying
 we're
 in
 a
 bubble
 at
 all.


Just
 saying
 like
 if
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of


excitement
 and
 that
 excitement
 is


justified
 via
 trade
 deals,
 Fed
 policy,


macro
 tailwinds
 with
 AI
 and
 capex
 spend


and
 good
 earnings.
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 the


bubble's
 going
 to
 form
 a
 couple
 years


from
 now.
 Maybe
 it's
 in
 2030,
 but
 over


the
 next
 four
 or
 five
 years,
 the


obligation
 for
 us
 as
 shareholders
 is
 to


make
 money.
 And
 being
 on
 the
 sidelines


is
 not
 necessarily
 the
 best
 way
 to
 make


money.
 It
 hasn't
 been
 the
 best
 way
 to


make
 money
 over
 the
 past
 three
 years.


retailers
 understood
 that
 way
 better


than
 the
 institutional
 guys
 and
 that's


why
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 have
 absolutely
 crushed


it
 in
 this
 market
 and
 now
 for
 us
 to


continue
 that
 we
 need
 earnings
 to
 be


strong
 and
 we
 need
 this
 momentum
 to


continue
 from
 all
 the
 broader
 trends


that
 we've
 seen
 over
 the
 past
 year


and
 if
 it
 can
 continue
 then
 that
 would


be
 very
 very
 exciting
 as
 we
 get
 into
 it


uh
 as
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 position
 in
 this
 I


know
 Mike
 Alfred
 who
 is
 you
 know
 he's


actually
 a
 friend
 we
 we've
 messaged


multiple
 times
 he
 took
 a
 million
 dollar


position
 in
 this
 thing
 95
 cents
 uh
 on


Friday.
 This
 is
 a
 Bitcoin
 derivative


play.
 I
 don't
 know
 much
 about
 it.
 I


don't
 have
 a
 position.
 Could
 I
 see
 it


pumping?
 Yes,
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 Twitter


is
 just
 getting
 really
 excited
 about


this
 potentially
 thinking
 it's
 the
 next


Beyond
 Me
 just,
 you
 know,
 like
 but
 I


could
 also
 see
 it
 selling
 off
 if
 people


dump
 their
 shares
 at
 the
 open.
 So,
 this


one
 is
 kind
 of a
 gamble.
 You
 got
 to
 have


some
 level
 of
 fundamental
 thesis
 on
 it.


Mike
 just
 says
 he
 likes
 the
 team
 and
 so


we'll
 keep
 track
 of
 it.
 But,
 you
 know,


that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 names
 that
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 excited
 about
 as
 well.


All right,
 here
 we
 go
 folks.
 It
 is


Monday,
 October
 27th,
 9:30
 a.m.
 Thank


you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 The
 first


market
 open
 as
 a
 28-year-old
 man.


Appreciate
 you
 all
 from
 the
 bottom
 of
 my


heart
 for
 being
 here.
 The
 stock
 market


is
 now
 open.


All
 right,
 wake
 your
 ass
 up.
 Let's
 get


into
 it.
 Here
 we
 go.
 Nvidia
 189.95
 190


up
 about
 2%
 on
 the
 day.
 Again,
 this
 one


was
 at
 195
 at
 the
 all-time
 highs.
 190


right
 there
 for
 Nvidia.
 Robin
 Hood
 141.


That's
 up
 3%
 on
 the
 day.
 Palunteer.
 Oh


boy,
 we
 are
 very
 close
 to
 breaking
 190.


That
 would
 be
 an
 all-time
 high.
 18804.


Got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 rejection
 right


there
 at
 189.
 If
 it
 can
 break
 through


190,
 then
 we
 would
 be
 seeing
 that


all-time
 high.
 Nvidia
 again
 up
 2%.


Tesla's
 up
 1%.
 S&P
 500
 682


68285


that
 is
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 AMD
 right


there
 255
 that's
 up.
 We
 do
 have
 some
 red


candles
 right
 at
 the
 open
 which
 is


normal
 kind
 of
 what
 I
 think
 most
 of
 us


expected
 because
 we
 were
 really
 flaming


hot
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 Now
 we
 got
 to


see
 if
 people
 come
 in
 and
 buy
 those


dips.
 But
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right
 there
 AMD


from
 258
 to
 255.
 That's
 red.
 From
 grab


to
 602
 to
 596.
 That's
 red.
 So
 just
 lost


30.
 You're
 seeing
 it
 kind
 of
 across
 the


board.
 But
 I
 think
 that's
 okay
 as
 you're


starting
 to
 get
 some
 momentum
 and
 buyers


come
 in.
 Wow.
 Pounder.
 190.
 There
 she


is.


190.
 Oh,
 she's
 going
 for
 191.


She
 is
 going
 for
 191
 right
 here.
 That
 is


a
 new
 alltime
 high
 on
 pounder,
 ladies


and
 gentlemen.
 That
 is
 a
 new
 all-time


high
 on
 Pounder.
 190.5.


Honestly,
 the
 best
 birthday
 gift
 I
 could


ask
 for.
 There
 you
 go.
 191.
 There
 she


is.


191.
 You
 got
 earnings
 coming
 up
 in
 about


a
 week.
 3.3%
 on
 the
 day.
 Congratulations


to
 everyone
 on
 Pound
 here.
 That
 is


absolutely
 incredible.
 Amazon
 228.


PayPal's
 up
 1.5.
 Salesforce
 up
 a
 little


bit.
 Meta
 754.
 Meta
 was
 at
 690
 for
 the


majority
 of
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 Meta


now
 here
 back
 at
 750.
 The
 GooGs

 It


hit
 267
 this
 morning.
 Hims
 is
 up
 1%.


Uber's
 up
 1%.
 Roblox

 half
 a
 percent.
 Rocket
 Lab
 up


1.4.
 Cororee
 up
 1.49.
 Where's
 Iren?
 Iren


6455.
 A
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 red
 candle,
 but


still
 this
 stock
 got
 all
 the
 way
 to
 50


last
 week
 in
 the
 draw
 down
 on
 a
 lot
 of


these
 momentum
 names.
 So,
 you
 got
 some


of
 the
 best
 ones
 starting
 to
 recover.


You
 have
 Cipher
 right
 here.
 That's
 at


20.
 Okay,
 Cipher
 goes
 red.
 It
 was
 at
 21


last
 night.
 So,
 that
 one
 losing
 some


steam.
 Cipher
 right
 here
 going
 red,
 but


still
 overall
 green
 for
 the
 past
 week.


Intel
 3905.
 That
 is
 green.
 Pouncer
 still


holding
 190.
 191.60


is
 what
 we
 got
 to
 SoFi
 losing
 30
 2976


S&P
 500
 still
 682
 and
 then
 Nvidia
 19018


as
 well
 and
 Nvidia
 twinning
 today
 both


of
 them
 in
 the
 190s
 BMR
 what
 do
 we
 have


for
 BMR
 we
 have
 53
 5240
 so
 a
 bit
 of
 a


red
 candle
 right
 there
 as
 ETH
 is
 getting


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 red
 candle
 4155
 just


below
 4200
 Bitcoin
 right
 there
 at
 115


app
 loven
 that's
 at
 1.72
 this
 was
 at
 550


last
 week
 that's
 at
 6:30.
 So
 again,
 last


week
 just
 created
 some
 really
 good


opportunities.
 How
 about
 AST
 Strive?


That
 is
 148
 up
 33%.


148.
 Let
 me
 know
 who
 anyone
 who's
 in


this
 one.
 Again,
 it
 took
 a
 life
 of
 its


own
 on
 Twitter
 on
 Friday
 after
 Mike


disclosed
 that
 he
 had
 a
 position
 in
 it.


And
 um
 I
 don't
 know,
 you
 just
 got
 a
 lot


of
 people
 that
 are
 buying
 to
 kind
 of
 be


part
 of
 the
 trade.
 But
 that
 does
 mean


that
 maybe
 there's
 some
 momentum
 on


there.
 Now
 there
 is
 a
 pipe.
 There
 are
 a


lot
 of
 warrants
 that
 get
 exercised.
 I


think
 there's
 about
 50%
 of
 the
 market


cap
 in
 dilution
 that's
 potentially


triggered
 at
 some
 of
 these
 prices.
 So,
 I


don't
 know
 kind
 of
 the
 fundamentals
 of


how
 the
 actual
 financial
 engineering
 of


this
 could
 play
 out,
 but
 you
 do
 have
 a


lot
 of
 people
 excited
 about
 the
 name
 and


that's
 why
 you're
 seeing
 some
 people


take
 these
 positions.

 Where
 is
 Beyond
 Meat?


Beyond
 Meat
 is
 down
 another
 14%.
 Okay,


so
 Beyond
 Meat,
 the
 quick
 update
 on
 this


is
 that
 their
 short
 flow
 from
 what
 I'm


seeing
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 sources
 I'm


looking
 at
 is
 161%.
 Meaning
 shorts
 are


borrowing
 shares
 that
 don't
 even
 exist.


The
 last
 time
 this
 happened
 on
 a
 mass


scale
 was
 GameStop.
 You've
 got
 a
 lot
 of


people
 on
 Twitter
 anecdotally
 that
 I've


seen
 that
 are
 thinking
 Beyond
 Meat
 is


the
 next
 GameStop.
 There's
 actually
 an


update
 on
 GameStop
 as
 well.
 The
 White


House
 tweeted
 at
 their
 account.
 Uh
 and


that's
 why
 GameStop
 right
 here
 is
 up


about
 3%.
 It
 was
 up
 5%
 yesterday.
 But
 uh


you
 do
 have
 some
 people
 yoloing
 into


Beyond
 Meat
 thinking
 it
 is
 the
 next
 uh


GameStop
 and
 that
 they're
 going
 to


squeeze
 the
 shorts,
 which
 you
 know,
 if


there
 was
 any
 potential
 to
 squeeze
 them.


You
 would
 squeeze
 them
 when
 the
 short
 is


161%
 of
 the
 float.
 But
 on
 a
 day
 like


today
 at
 least,
 you're
 just
 not
 seeing


it
 yet.
 Maybe
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 is
 just


going
 into
 Nvidia
 over
 Beyond
 Meat.
 And


that's
 why
 that
 stock
 is
 down
 11%.
 Big

 that

It

 you
 go.
 That

 How
 about
 Oakllo?


Oaklow
 is
 losing
 some

 as
 well.
 It

 now
 it's

 How
 about


the

 ONQ,
 that's
 up

Dwave,
 that
 is

 Okay,


so
 across
 the
 board,
 you're
 seeing
 some


red
 candles
 come
 in.
 Uh
 SoFi
 getting
 a
 a


deeper
 red
 candle
 even
 though
 it
 is


still
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 Tesla
 as
 well


1.6%
 that's
 up
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 if


some
 of
 these
 names
 can
 recover
 from


these
 red
 candles
 and
 if
 some
 of
 them


have
 the
 dip
 buyers
 coming
 in.

Again,
 a
 lot
 of these
 names
 losing
 some


of
 those
 levels
 they
 had
 in
 the


pre-market,
 which
 is
 normal.
 It's
 to
 be


expected.
 I
 think
 you
 need
 a
 couple
 more


hours
 of
 data
 to
 see
 if
 those
 dip
 buyers


actually
 do
 come
 in.
 Robin
 Hood,
 though,


holding
 on
 145.
 Robin
 Hood
 not
 really


seeing
 a
 red
 candle
 today.
 I
 mean,
 it's


down
 40
 cents
 from
 the
 highs,
 which
 is
 a


lot
 better
 than
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 other


names
 that
 are
 down
 basically
 three
 four


dollars,
 losing
 a
 lot
 of
 their
 their


momentum.

 is

 definitely


seeing
 some
 red

 Not
 really


getting

 green.
 Uh


Fix,
 we
 looked
 at
 that
 stock
 last
 week.


Looks
 like
 they
 got
 an
 upgrade
 today


from
 UBS.
 Uh
 they
 were
 up
 18%
 after


earnings,
 upgraded
 to
 1140.
 This
 is
 the


HVAC
 company
 playing
 a
 bigger
 role
 in


the
 data
 center
 space.
 So
 that's
 getting


some
 love.
 Let's
 look
 at
 the
 Bitcoin


miners
 turn
 data
 centers.
 All
 of
 them


are
 still
 holding
 green.
 They're
 not
 as


green
 as
 they
 were
 in
 the
 pre-market,


but
 they're
 still
 pretty
 like
 Bit
 Farms


was
 up
 10%,
 now
 it's
 up
 3%.
 So,


we're
 going to
 have
 to
 keep
 an
 eye
 on


these
 because
 when
 when
 they
 lose
 the


pre-market
 momentum,
 the
 question
 is,
 do


they
 hold
 on
 to
 any
 level
 of
 green?
 And


so
 far,
 most
 of
 them
 are.
 Uh,
 but
 we
 got


to
 see
 if
 dip
 buyers
 come
 in
 or
 if


there's
 still
 a
 bit
 of
 selling
 pressure.


Rare
 Earths
 obviously
 getting
 crushed


because
 it
 looks
 like
 a
 China

 is


coming.
 So,
 if
 you're
 long
 rare

today
 is
 definitely
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an


ugly
 day.
 Critical

 up

Morgan
 Stanley
 says,
 "Tesla
 Roboaxi
 is


now
 solved.
 I
 have
 not
 upgraded
 yet
 to


uh
 Tesla
 FSD14."


Tesla,
 right?
 They're
 up
 2.4%.
 Tesla
 got


a
 couple
 upgrades
 over
 the
 weekend
 as


well.
 I'll
 get
 to
 some
 of
 these
 upgrades


and
 show
 you
 guys,
 but
 uh
 a
 couple
 of


them
 in
 the
 500
 range.
 couple
 of
 them
 in


the
 470
 range
 and
 it
 does
 look
 like


people
 are
 getting
 more
 bullish
 on


Tessy.
 Yeah,
 Caner
 Fitzgerald
 raised


them
 to
 510
 and
 they
 said
 Tesla


disclosed
 that
 the
 volume
 production
 of


its
 cyber
 cap
 semi
 and
 mega
 pack
 all


three
 are
 on
 track
 for
 fiscal
 year
 2026.


Overall,
 we
 remain
 bullish
 on
 Tesla
 over


the
 medium
 to
 long-term
 and
 we
 continue


to
 see
 meaningful
 future
 upside
 from


energy
 storage
 and
 deployment
 along
 with


optimist
 spots.
 We
 are
 raising
 our


target
 from
 355
 to
 510.
 That's
 a
 hell
 of


an
 upgrade
 and
 you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 more


of
 that
 across
 the
 board.
 Wow.
 Pal,
 did


we
 touch
 192?
 Oh
 my
 goodness,
 we
 touched


192.


Hold
 on,
 let
 me
 check
 resistance
 again.


We
 just
 fell
 below
 it.


Oh
 my.
 Oh
 my.
 Oh
 my.
 190.
 So,
 let
 me


check
 193
 resistance
 then
 because
 we


just
 did
 19218.
 193
 resistance
 is
 27,000


shares.


27,000
 shares.


Look,
 I've
 been
 saying
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks,
 I
 think
 pounds
 are
 at
 200.


I've
 been
 annoying
 Steve.
 I've
 been


annoying
 a
 couple
 of
 people
 I'm
 in
 a


group
 chat
 with.
 I'm
 like,
 "Guys,"


they're
 like, "Yo,
 what
 should
 we
 buy?"


And
 I'm
 like,
 "I
 think
 it's
 Palanteer."


They're
 like, "We
 can't
 buy
 Palunteer."


I'm
 like,
 "Well,
 I
 I
 think
 it's


Palanteer."
 And
 I
 put
 my
 money
 where
 my


mouth
 is.
 I
 bought
 at
 171,
 bought
 at


172,
 bought
 at
 178.
 I
 do
 think
 when
 they


report
 52
 to
 54%
 growth,
 I
 don't
 know


what
 the
 exact
 number
 is,
 but
 I
 think
 if


it's
 above
 50,
 I
 don't
 think
 the


street's
 going
 to
 be
 upset.
 And
 then
 you


got
 rates
 coming
 down.
 And
 then
 you
 got


the
 government
 business
 doing
 well.
 You


got
 the
 international
 government


business
 going
 well
 with
 this
 Poland


deal
 they
 got
 this
 morning.
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 it
 might
 have
 a
 date
 with
 200,
 but


we've
 got
 to
 see.
 I'm
 buying
 pounder


knowing
 the
 valuation
 is
 aggressive
 and


knowing
 that
 it
 could
 dip
 and
 you
 know,


you
 would
 have
 to
 just
 deal
 with
 the


fact
 that
 you're
 you're
 buying
 a
 name


that
 is
 pretty
 expensive,
 but
 I
 think


they
 might
 be
 able
 to
 put
 up
 the
 growth.


Micro

 right
 there,
 that's
 up


3%.
 PaloAlto,
 that's
 up
 1.2%.
 Microsoft,


that's
 up
 1.2%
 as
 well.


Hood.
 Are
 we
 at
 146?
 We
 did
 touch
 146.


Wow.
 So,
 Hood
 and
 Palanteer
 are
 holding


a
 lot
 of
 their
 momentum
 even
 though
 some


of these
 other
 names
 are
 getting
 hit


from
 the
 pre-market.
 Even
 so
 far,
 I
 know


it's
 below
 30,
 but
 it's
 it's
 gapping


back
 up
 from
 the
 low
 29s,


which
 is
 also
 green.
 Tesla
 does
 hold


Bitcoin
 still.
 Correct
 me
 if
 I'm
 wrong,


but
 they
 still
 have
 1.5
 billion
 of


Bitcoin.
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 they
 have
 not


sold
 their
 Bitcoin.
 So,
 yes,
 Tesla
 does


still
 own


their
 Bitcoin
 and
 that
 could
 be
 a


tailwind
 for
 them
 as
 well.
 Nebius,
 what


do
 we
 have?
 Nebius
 122,
 Nebius
 as
 well


doing
 a
 pretty
 good
 job
 holding
 its


momentum.
 Again,
 the
 past
 couple
 of


weeks,
 we
 talked
 about
 it
 a
 lot
 on
 the


channel.
 We
 saw
 momentum
 draw
 down.
 And


so,
 Hood
 and
 Nebus,
 which
 are
 momentum


stocks,
 took
 a
 draw
 down,
 but
 then
 you


have
 like
 the
 Oloss
 and
 Big
 Bear
 AIS
 of


the
 world
 that
 took
 a
 really
 big
 draw


down.
 So
 now
 the
 question
 is
 given
 the


markets
 have
 kind
 of
 decided
 all
 right


we're
 past
 the
 China
 stuff
 and
 we're


past
 the
 necessity
 to
 continue
 having
 a


meaningful
 draw
 down
 which
 of
 the
 names


that
 took
 that
 draw
 down
 which


essentially
 was
 the
 broader
 markets
 just


some
 names
 got
 hit
 worse
 than
 others
 can


recover


and
 you
 know
 a
 Hood
 and
 Nebius
 which
 are


very
 good
 quality
 companies
 I
 think
 they


have
 a
 really
 good
 shot
 to
 recover
 some


of the
 other
 names
 I
 think
 they
 will


recover
 just
 don't
 know
 how
 much
 they


will
 recover
 and
 that's
 something
 I


think
 we
 all
 have
 to
 keep
 an
 eye
 on
 as


we
 get
 into
 this
 Palanteer
 right
 there


191
 Hood

 Verdive,
 that's
 at

Where's
 ES
 as
 like
 this
 one
 got
 to
 102.


Now
 it's
 at
 74.
 Still
 up
 double
 from


September.
 It
 just
 was
 up
 close
 to


triple.
 The
 question
 is,
 you
 know,
 does


this
 get
 back
 to
 102
 or
 does
 this
 settle


in
 at
 74.
 And
 look,
 at
 the
 end
 of the


day,
 if
 AS
 settles
 in
 at
 74,
 I
 don't


think
 people
 can
 be
 that
 upset
 because


it
 would
 still
 be
 up
 240%
 for
 the
 year,


right?


Which
 is
 still
 very
 bullish
 to
 see
 those


names
 continue
 to
 hold
 those
 moment


those
 levels
 of
 momentum.
 Nvidia

to

 Gold

 on

 officially.
 Wow.
 Gold's
 31


bucks
 away
 from
 losing
 4,000.
 It
 didn't


lose
 4,000
 last
 Friday.
 It
 was
 almost
 at


this
 level.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 like
 45,52.


It
 was
 very
 close
 and
 then
 it
 recovered.


Wow.
 4,026.
 I'm
 curious
 if
 it
 actually


loses
 4,000.
 I
 think
 just


psychologically


that
 would
 be
 something
 to
 to
 take
 a


look
 at.


Um,


okay.
 Still
 getting
 some
 green
 right


here.
 AMD
 254.
 Walmart's
 down.
 Let's


look
 at
 some
 of the
 Wow,
 VIX
 down
 3%.


Look
 at
 that.
 VIX
 was
 at
 25.
 You
 know,


the
 VIX
 spike
 to
 25.
 Very
 similar
 to
 the


April
 VIX
 spike
 to
 what
 was
 it
 at?
 It


was
 at
 60.
 I
 think
 when
 we
 see
 those
 VIX


spikes
 and
 you
 know
 we've
 talked
 about


this
 so
 many
 times
 but
 it
 just
 you
 got


to
 shut
 up
 and
 buy
 like
 when
 you
 see
 a


when
 you
 the
 VIX
 naturally
 goes
 up
 over


time
 then
 it's
 maybe
 a
 more
 prolonged


draw
 down
 that's
 based
 on
 something
 more


fundamental
 when
 it's
 a
 spike
 30%
 in
 a


day
 which
 is
 what
 we
 had
 two
 weeks
 ago


it
 usually
 is
 peak
 panic
 and
 you
 know
 a


$20
 billion
 crypto
 liquidation
 could


create
 that
 type
 of
 volatility
 in
 the


VIX
 it
 t
 it
 tends
 to
 be
 a
 moment
 to
 just


buy
 something


even
 though
 you
 know
 Everyone
 wants
 to


sell
 and
 that's
 what
 retail's
 done


really
 well
 this
 year.
 Apple

SMCI

there
 from

 Bitcoin
 is
 getting


sold
 off
 a
 bit
 and
 Ethereum
 is
 getting


sold
 off
 a
 bit
 as
 well.
 Wow,
 hoodie
 147.


Okay,
 so
 the
 markets
 are
 probably
 happy


about
 the
 161
 price
 target.
 They're


probably
 happy
 about
 the
 prediction


markets
 which
 have
 started
 to
 get,
 you


know,
 average
 people
 that
 have
 never
 bet


on
 anything
 before
 in
 sports
 to
 to
 sort


of
 integrate
 themselves
 into
 that


product,
 which
 is
 a
 testament
 to
 how


well
 the
 product
 is
 adapting
 itself
 to
 a


regular
 person.
 Um,
 and
 increased
 EPS


estimates
 and
 ebida
 estimates.
 I
 mean,


those
 three
 things,
 I
 guess,
 are


tailwinds.
 Not
 to
 mention,
 banking


hasn't
 even
 launched
 yet.
 Banking
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 product
 in
 next
 year


and
 so
 the
 street
 might
 be
 kind
 of
 front


running
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that
 momentum
 if


they
 think
 there's
 some
 good
 early
 signs


of
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 banking.


So
 that's
 very
 exciting
 as
 well.
 Nebas,


are
 we
 getting
 a
 move
 on
 Nebius
 as
 well?


Nebas.
 Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 24
 Hood
 and


Nebius
 basically
 showing
 that
 they
 can


handle
 a
 draw
 down
 of
 more
 than
 10
 to


15%
 and
 still


have
 a
 recovery
 because
 there's
 some


fundamentals
 towards
 their
 earnings


which
 is
 uh
 which
 is
 why
 you're
 getting


some
 green
 right
 here.
 And
 then
 SoFi


trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 30.
 Where's


Amcore?
 They
 have
 earnings
 today
 as


well.
 AM
 Core
 3355.


So
 we
 talked
 about
 the
 stock
 when
 it
 was


at
 28.
 It's
 at
 33.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 exactly


what
 the
 earnings
 will
 do
 to
 it
 today.


Um
 I
 I
 do
 expect
 if
 they
 have
 a
 monster


earnings
 and
 some
 good
 guidance
 going


into
 2026,
 then
 that
 could
 be
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 rerating
 for
 the
 stock,
 but
 it


is
 up
 a
 decent
 chunk
 since
 we
 talked


about
 it
 already.
 So
 it
 wouldn't


surprise
 me
 if
 it's
 kind
 of
 flat,
 maybe


sells
 off
 a
 little
 bit.
 It
 really


depends
 on
 how
 good
 of
 a
 guidance
 can


they
 give
 for
 2026.
 Again,
 they're
 one


of the
 only
 packaging
 companies
 and


semiconductors
 in
 the
 US
 that
 is
 working


very
 closely
 with
 TSM.
 And
 given
 TSM's


earnings
 were
 really
 good,
 I
 would


imagine
 Amcor


would
 be
 the
 beneficiary
 of
 that.
 Also,


again,
 Amcore
 trades
 at
 1.5
 times
 sales.


So,
 you
 know,
 it's
 it's
 just
 really
 not


as
 expensive
 of
 a
 multiple
 as
 some
 of


these
 other
 names.

 Wow,

higher.
 147.88.
 You
 got
 earnings
 coming


up
 in
 a
 week.
 The
 street
 might
 also
 be


front
 running
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that


earnings


that
 we're
 seeing
 as
 well.
 Uh,
 American


Bitcoin
 company
 acquired
 1,400
 Bitcoin.


ABTC,
 this
 is
 the
 Trump
 Sun
 Bitcoin


company.
 That
 stock's
 up
 6.94%.
 Where's


AST?


Uh,
 that
 one's
 still
 holding
 34%
 148.


How
 about
 Oaklow?


Oaklo
 is
 a
 dollar
 away
 from
 going
 red.


All right,
 so
 Oakllo
 was
 at
 118
 last


week.
 Uh
 recovered
 to
 137
 as
 we're


seeing
 right
 here.
 It
 was
 at
 148
 last


night.
 So,
 it
 is
 getting
 a
 bit
 of a


sell-off,
 but
 one
 of
 the
 momentum
 names


that
 took
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 draw
 down.
 Not
 as


bad
 as
 it
 was
 last
 week,


but
 not,
 you
 know,
 back
 to
 those
 alltime


high
 levels
 either.


And
 then
 BMR,
 are
 we
 still
 moving
 BMR?


BMR
 5283.


All
 right,
 look.
 It's
 not
 horrible.
 It's


not
 horrible.
 You
 know,
 gold
 is
 still


down
 right
 here.
 2.13%.
 It
 is
 the


closest
 it's
 ever
 been
 to
 getting
 back


below
 to
 that
 4,000
 level.
 Uh
 yeah,
 grab


over
 six
 right
 here.
 Let
 me
 pull
 up
 this


chart


that
 actually
 shows
 some
 of
 the


some
 of
 the
 central
 bank
 buying
 on
 gold


as
 well


because
 you're
 starting
 to
 see
 that


accelerate.


uh
 across
 the
 board


and
 that's
 also
 making
 some
 more
 green.


Let's
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.
 Dutch


Bros
 is
 moving
 today.
 Where
 is
 Dutch


Bros?
 Dutch
 Bros
 right
 here.
 Wow.
 5%
 on


Bros.
 Yeah.
 Yeah,
 you
 are
 getting
 move


on
 Dutch
 Bros.
 That
 one


that
 one's
 been
 stuck
 for
 a
 minute
 right


now.


Assist
 $197,000
 call
 buyer
 $15
 strike.


Wow.
 Someone
 put
 in
 200K
 to
 the
 $15


strike
 on
 ASST.


Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.
 I
 mean,
 ASST
 was


at
 nine
 bucks
 the
 other
 day.


And
 so,
 you
 know,
 now
 that
 it's
 down
 to


one,
 you
 know,
 people
 might
 think
 it
 can


get
 up
 there.


Okay,
 give
 me
 a
 second.
 My
 computer
 is


being
 a
 little
 wonky
 right
 here.
 Trying


to
 switch
 the
 tab.


I
 think
 it
 needs
 a
 minute.
 I
 think
 my


computer
 got
 too
 excited.
 Here
 we
 go.


There
 we
 are.
 Back
 to
 normal.
 Okay,


there's
 Bitmine
 right
 there.
 5324.


Pounds
 are
 still
 191.
 Here's
 the
 chart
 I


was
 signaling
 for
 gold.
 Central
 banks


are
 in
 their
 longest
 gold
 buying
 spree.


As
 you
 can
 see
 right
 here,
 the
 2025


annualized
 versus
 the
 net
 central
 bank


gold
 purchases
 in
 tons.
 I
 mean,
 that


chart
 just
 looks
 crazy.
 The
 amount
 of


gold
 that
 is
 being
 bought
 is
 massive.


And
 you
 know
 I
 want
 retail
 iss
 getting


in
 on
 this
 trade
 or
 kind
 of
 where
 this


trade
 goes
 from
 here
 but
 you
 are
 seeing


a
 decent
 amount
 of
 momentum
 in
 the
 gold


trade.
 Pounder
 191.
 Robin
 and
 wow
 she's


going
 for
 149.
 So
 back
 to
 30.
 Okay
 maybe


we're
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 rebound.
 Grab


back
 above
 6.
 Amazon
 pushing
 228.
 Meta


753.
 Tesla
 high
 of
 day
 at
 443.
 AMD
 254.


And
 then
 S&P
 got
 to
 683
 just
 below
 that.


Still
 up
 almost
 1%
 on
 the
 day.
 Hood
 and


pouch.
 You're
 really
 having
 a
 nice
 day.


Not
 bad
 at
 all.
 AMD
 right
 there
 at
 253.


Where's
 UNH?
 UNH
 is
 red.
 Okay,
 so
 that


one
 goes
 red.


Uh
 Micron,
 does
 that
 one
 go
 red?
 Micron


also
 potentially
 about
 to
 go
 red.
 The


semiconductor
 stocks
 across
 the
 board


are
 pretty
 green.
 Qualcomm,
 Marll,
 ARM,


Lamb
 Research,
 Micron
 a
 little
 a
 little


weak,
 but
 still
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 Dell's


up
 1%,
 Broadcom's
 up
 1.3,
 ASML's
 up,


SMCI
 having
 the
 best
 day.
 That's
 up
 5%


and
 then
 Nvidia
 as
 well
 190.84


leading
 away.
 Mastercard
 and
 PayPal


announced
 a
 collaboration
 to
 integrate


Mastercard
 agent
 pay
 into
 PayPal's


digital
 wallet,
 enabling
 AI
 agents
 to


autonomously
 compete
 transactions
 for


user.
 This
 is
 similar
 to
 the
 headline
 we


saw
 yesterday
 about
 zel
 starting
 to


integrate
 um
 and
 allow
 people
 to
 pay


with
 stable
 coins.
 So
 whether
 it's


blockchain,
 whether
 it's
 AI,
 you're


starting
 to
 see
 some
 of
 the
 legacy


financial
 players
 getting
 more
 excited


about
 integrating
 into
 the
 financial


ecosystem
 uh and
 merge
 with
 crypto.


Speaking
 of
 PayPal,
 I
 got
 a
 message
 uh


from
 Suchin
 today.
 He
 bought
 PayPal


Leaps.
 He
 bought
 PayPal
 Leaps.
 The
 the


strike
 he
 paid
 was
 one
 or
 the
 he
 he


bought
 110


January
 2028
 LEAPS.
 He
 paid8.40
 for


them.$8.40
 40
 for
 110


January
 2028.
 So
 he's
 expecting
 PayPal


to
 essentially
 make


essentially
 make
 a
 57%
 move
 in
 two
 years


and
 that's
 why
 he
 bought
 those
 leaps.


Silver
 down
 3%.


Look,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 are
 into


PayPal.
 Leaps
 just
 means
 longdated


uh
 contracts,
 option
 contracts,
 calls.


So
 he
 is
 betting


via
 a
 delta
 towards
 the
 underlying
 asset


which
 should
 result
 in
 more
 alpha
 for


the
 call
 option
 that
 PayPal
 will
 do


pretty
 good
 in
 the
 next
 two
 years.


Probably
 be
 you
 know
 much
 above
 110


and
 that
 should
 do
 well
 for
 him.
 PayPal


right
 they're
 up
 1%
 on
 the
 day.
 Apple


that's
 up
 1.2%
 as
 well.
 Now
 a
 leap


doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 in
 the
 money.
 It


could
 be
 out
 of
 the
 money
 or
 in
 the


money.
 In
 this
 case,
 Suchin
 is
 doing
 OTM


leaps,
 right?
 Out
 of
 the
 money
 because


110
 is
 away
 from
 70.
 If
 it
 was
 in
 the


money,
 it
 would
 be
 like
 $70
 less,
 $65


leaps.
 And
 those
 move
 at
 a
 at
 a
 delta


towards
 the
 underlying,
 but
 they
 don't


move
 as
 at
 an
 aggressive
 delta
 because


you're
 taking
 less
 risk
 because
 the


stock
 is
 already
 in
 the
 money.


So,
 he's
 obviously
 pretty
 bullish
 that


PayPal's
 going
 to
 make
 a
 pretty
 big


move.
 Speaking
 of
 leaps,
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot


of
 people
 have
 SoFi
 LEAPS
 that
 are


expiring
 in
 January.
 $7
 strike,
 $15


strike,
 $20
 strike.
 I
 mean,
 there
 might


be
 a
 decent
 decent
 chunk
 of
 uh
 of
 those


leaps
 being
 rewarded.
 I
 mean,
 even
 my


dad
 bought
 SoFi
 leaps
 at
 seven
 bucks
 for


$10
 2026.
 SoFi
 makes
 a
 10-
 15%
 move
 this


week.
 There's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 those


contracts
 that
 get
 deeper
 in
 the
 money,


which
 would
 also
 be
 very
 exciting.


Uh
 let's
 take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 heat
 map.


What
 do
 we
 got
 going
 on?
 Yeah,
 look
 at


this,
 bro.
 We
 are
 pretty
 green.
 Healthc


care
 is
 red
 and
 defensives
 are
 red.


Everything
 else


You're
 seeing
 green.


You
 are
 seeing


green.


Shout
 out
 to
 Adam.
 I'm
 a
 SoFi
 mini


whale.
 Yeah,
 Adam.
 I
 was
 saying
 last


night
 that
 Adam
 took
 a
 pretty
 big


position
 on
 SoFi
 during
 that
 $24
 dip,


$25
 dip
 that
 we
 saw
 three
 weeks
 ago.
 And


look,
 that's
 that's
 when
 it's
 the
 most


fun
 to
 buy
 the
 dip.
 Like,
 it's
 a
 good


quality
 company.
 And
 even
 if
 the
 stock


doesn't
 get
 to
 where
 you
 want
 it
 to
 be,


especially
 if
 you're
 just,
 you
 know,


under
 you
 have
 underlying
 shares
 or
 even


if
 you're
 shorts
 and
 puts,
 you
 don't


mind
 being
 assigned
 because
 you're
 happy


to
 own
 a
 good
 company
 at
 a
 good
 price.


Sofa
 just
 has
 to
 give
 us
 the
 earnings
 to


make
 us
 feel
 like
 it
 really
 is
 a
 company


that's
 executing
 and
 deserves
 a
 premium.


But
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 those
 earnings


tomorrow.
 We'll
 be
 up
 bright
 and
 early.


I'll
 be
 up
 uh
 7:25.
 I
 think
 Steve
 will


join
 me.
 7:25,
 7:30.
 Said
 the
 results


are
 out
 at
 7.
 So,
 from
 7:30
 to
 8,
 we'll


analyze
 the
 numbers
 and
 then
 at
 8
 p.m.


we'll
 have
 the
 call.
 Pounds
 right
 there.


191.


That
 is
 still
 green.
 Is
 there
 still
 a


market
 close
 today?
 Yes,
 there
 will
 be
 a


market
 close.
 We'll
 do
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


the
 end
 of
 the
 close.
 I'll
 show
 you
 guys


some
 pictures
 from
 my
 past.
 It'll
 be
 a


little
 fun
 trip
 down
 memory
 lane
 to
 end


out
 the
 the
 birthday
 today,
 but
 we
 will


be
 live
 for
 the
 market
 close.
 Rock
 Lab


right
 there
 1.6%.
 That
 is
 green.
 Dell's


up.
 Verizon's
 up
 a
 little bit
 today.


Verizon
 did
 lose
 40
 last
 week.
 Archer,


that's
 also
 up.
 And
 then
 Dolingo


slightly
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 Iran
 starting


to
 recover.
 That's
 back
 to
 66


up
 5%
 on
 the
 day.


Dude,
 you're
 seeing
 a
 pretty
 good
 day.


You're
 seeing
 individual
 names
 are


getting
 a
 little
 hit
 like
 an
 Oracle.
 You


know,
 if
 you're
 wondering
 why
 Oracle
 is


down,
 Oracle's
 up
 a
 lot
 for
 the
 year,


right?
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names,


Oracle's
 up
 seven
 again,
 this
 is
 a
 this


is
 a
 multiundred
 billion
 dollar
 company.


moving
 70%
 is
 massive
 and
 so
 yeah,
 it's


not
 at
 350
 anymore,
 but
 it
 is
 taking
 a


bit
 of
 a
 haircut.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of the


names
 that
 are
 down
 today,
 there's
 not


really
 a
 super
 super
 fundamental
 reason


they're
 down
 unless
 there's
 like
 some


news
 that's
 out.
 I
 think
 it's
 more
 so


the
 market
 is
 just
 telling
 you
 we're
 not


able
 to
 keep
 giving
 it
 this
 much
 of
 a


premium.
 And
 on
 a
 day
 like
 today
 where


everything's
 green,
 the
 names
 that
 are


getting
 an
 elevated
 premium
 are
 likely


the
 market
 saying,
 "Hey,
 like
 we
 think


there's
 something
 coming
 up
 in
 the


future."
 Whether
 it's
 50%
 growth
 for


Palunteer
 or
 whether
 it's
 a
 massive
 Q3


for
 Robin
 Hood
 or
 whether
 it's
 a
 huge


refinancing
 boom
 of
 of
 student
 loans
 and


mortgages
 for
 SoFi.
 We
 think
 there's


something
 coming
 up
 that
 is
 allowing
 us


to
 give
 the
 stock
 some
 more
 value.
 With


Oracle,
 a
 lot
 of the
 good
 news
 is
 baked


in.
 They
 already
 announced
 remaining


performance
 obligations
 up
 500%,
 right?


So
 it's
 like
 what
 else
 could
 they


announce
 that
 really
 I
 mean
 they
 already


gave
 guidance
 for
 2035
 and
 so
 you
 know


it's
 like
 when
 when
 you've
 already


priced
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 in
 you
 just
 might


not
 have
 that
 many
 more
 catalysts
 and


that's
 why
 it's
 taking
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


breather.
 IBM
 didn't
 have
 the
 best


earnings
 and
 that's
 why
 that
 stock
 has


been
 struggling
 a
 bit
 but
 that
 one's


still
 up
 a
 decent
 amount


uh
 for
 the
 year.


OpenAI
 says
 $1
 trillion
 AI
 buildout


could
 lift
 GDP
 by
 5%
 urges
 100
 gawatt


energy
 push
 to
 close
 electron
 gap
 with


China.


Okay,
 so
 you
 got
 OpenAI
 continuously


saying
 hey
 this
 is
 a
 AI
 war
 and
 we
 need


to
 be
 part
 of
 it.
 This
 chart
 yesterday
 I


thought
 was
 really
 important
 to
 look
 at


in
 the
 context
 of
 chatbt.
 OpenAI
 is


projecting
 to
 reach
 a hundred
 billion


dollars
 in
 revenue
 in
 the
 fastest
 amount


of
 time
 in
 the
 history
 of
 tech


companies.
 every
 other
 company
 took


about
 eight
 years.
 Opening
 eye
 would
 be


doing
 it
 in
 about
 four.
 If
 they
 can
 pull


it
 off,
 I
 mean,
 it
 would
 be
 quite


incredible
 to
 see.
 But
 we've
 got
 to
 see


if
 that
 happens.
 Now,
 in
 terms
 of


GameStop,
 so
 GameStop
 made
 a
 statement


the
 other
 day
 saying
 that
 we
 declare
 the


console
 wars
 are
 over.
 And
 this
 goes


back
 to
 some
 of
 the
 marketing
 campaigns


they
 had
 in
 the
 early
 2000s
 about


console
 wars.
 And
 then
 the
 White
 House


quote
 tweeted
 it
 and
 said,
 "Power
 to
 the


players."


And


This
 is
 this
 is
 a
 real
 photo
 you're


looking
 at.
 Uh
 that's
 why
 GameStop
 had
 a


bit
 of
 excitement
 this
 morning.
 Selling


off
 a
 little
 bit
 right
 now,
 but
 yeah,


potentially
 GameStop
 getting
 some
 of


that
 momentum.
 Pound
 here.
 Trying
 to
 get


back
 to
 192.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get


there.
 We
 touched
 it
 a
 couple.
 There
 you


go.
 Back
 to
 192.


Back
 to
 192.
 193
 resistance
 is
 27,000


shares.


This
 is
 a
 really
 nice
 birthday
 gift
 from


Pounder.
 It's
 a
 very,


very
 nice
 birthday
 gift.


The
 group
 chats
 are
 going
 to
 be
 annoyed


though
 when
 I
 say
 Paliner's
 up
 because


at
 170,
 you
 know,
 when
 the
 October
 draw


down,
 they're
 like,
 "What
 do
 we
 buy?"
 I


was
 like, "Dude,
 I
 think
 we
 buy


Paliner."


Like,
 "No,
 we
 can't
 buy
 Palin."
 It's


like,
 I
 get
 it.
 But
 I'm
 just
 saying.


I
 am
 just
 saying.
 I
 ran
 still
 making
 a


move
 as
 well.
 That's
 green.


And
 you
 got
 pounder
 right
 there
 at


19168.
 So
 I
 was
 saying
 this
 last
 night,


but
 there
 is
 a
 book
 coming
 out
 about


Karp.
 I
 mentioned
 it
 in
 the
 morning.
 Uh


I
 just
 interviewed
 the
 author
 of
 the


book
 yesterday.
 That
 interview
 will
 come


out
 in
 about
 a
 week.
 I
 think
 you
 guys


will
 really
 enjoy
 it.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


um
 lot
 of
 details
 about
 Karp's
 life
 that


people
 don't
 know
 about
 that
 is
 in
 this


book.
 And
 the
 coolest,
 I
 guess
 you
 can


call
 this
 birthday
 gift
 that
 I
 got
 over


the
 weekend
 was
 that
 um
 I'm
 in
 the


epilogue.
 I
 didn't
 realize
 I
 was
 in
 the


book,
 but
 I
 am
 in
 the
 book.
 So
 the


author
 basically
 was
 talking
 about
 how


when
 he
 went
 to
 visit
 Karp
 at
 the
 New


York
 office,
 Karp
 was
 in
 deep


conversation
 with
 Amikraia,
 a
 stock


commentator
 who
 was
 possibly
 pounder's


biggest
 fan
 in
 the
 retail
 investment


community.
 It's
 a
 short
 mention,
 but
 it


was
 kind
 of
 wild.
 I've
 never
 been


included
 in
 a
 book
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 I
 think


it
 was
 a
 testament
 to
 just
 like
 the


retail
 investor
 that
 has
 kept
 up
 so


deeply
 with
 this
 company
 to
 be
 included


in
 an
 autobiography
 about
 Karp's
 life.


So
 that
 that
 was
 that
 was
 pretty
 crazy


to
 see.
 It
 was
 crazy
 for
 my
 mom,
 that's


for
 sure.
 My
 mom
 was
 freaking
 out,
 but


it
 was
 uh
 it
 was
 dope
 to
 see.
 So,
 like


even
 even
 that
 being
 part
 of
 the
 story,


I
 think
 is
 so
 exciting
 because
 it
 is
 an


autobiography
 about
 his
 life.
 And
 it
 is


a
 really
 good
 book.
 Like
 I
 don't
 read
 a


lot
 of
 books.
 You
 guys
 know
 that
 I'm
 not


big
 into
 like
 reading
 books.
 I
 actually


read
 the
 book
 over
 the
 weekend.
 Like
 I


was
 it
 was
 like
 2
 am
 at
 night.
 I
 was


flipping
 through
 the
 pages
 really


reading
 the
 books.
 I
 was
 so
 interested


in
 it.
 Kind
 of
 kind
 of
 made
 me
 love


reading
 again
 to
 be
 honest.
 And
 so
 it


was
 a
 nice
 surprise
 to
 uh
 to
 be
 included


as
 well.


should
 have
 referred
 to
 you
 as
 the
 CEO


of
 AK
 Media.
 SMB
 back
 to
 683,
 baby.
 Back


to
 683.


But
 it
 was
 pretty
 cool
 because
 it's
 just


like
 that
 that
 was
 a
 real
 thing
 that


happened.
 I
 was
 I
 was
 sitting
 and


talking
 with
 Karp.
 Ironically,
 Karp
 was


saying
 that
 day,
 this
 was
 after
 they
 got


into
 the
 NASDAQ,
 that
 uh,
 you
 know,
 the


institutional
 guys
 got
 it
 so
 wrong.
 And


we
 were
 just
 kind
 of
 laughing
 about
 it,


talking
 about,
 and
 then
 I
 guess
 Michael


Steinberger,
 the
 author
 of
 the
 book,
 was


observing
 that
 whole
 thing.
 And
 he
 put


that
 entire
 entire
 situation
 in
 the
 book


and
 and
 it
 was
 a
 real
 thing
 that


happened.
 And
 I
 was
 reading,
 I
 was


remembering,
 oh
 yeah,
 that
 did
 happen


back
 in
 December
 of
 last
 year.
 It
 goes


to
 show
 how
 good
 of
 a
 writer
 he
 is
 and


how
 much
 he
 observes
 like
 the
 world


around
 him.
 But
 the
 fact
 that
 that


scenario
 made
 it
 into
 the
 book,
 I


thought
 was
 pretty
 special.
 S&P
 683,


you're
 getting
 a
 big
 green
 candle
 right


there.
 I
 don't know
 if
 there's
 any
 news,


but
 you
 are
 getting
 a
 breakout
 to


all-time
 highs
 again
 on
 the
 S&P.
 Google


kind
 of
 following
 at
 265.
 Robin
 Hood


getting
 ready
 to
 bust
 through
 149,


potentially
 150.


And
 you
 got
 Palunter
 still
 right
 there.


Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 Paler
 19239.
 All


right,
 so
 alltime
 high
 on
 Palenter


again.
 There
 must
 be
 something
 helping


the
 S&P.
 I
 don't
 know if
 we
 have
 any


data
 today.
 We
 don't
 look
 like
 we
 have


any
 macro
 data,


but
 you're
 getting
 enough.
 Green
 hoods


up
 6.5%.


Dude,
 S&P
 is
 really
 close
 to
 7,000.
 I


mean,
 we're
 less
 than
 2%
 away,
 so
 it


feels
 like
 it
 feels
 like
 there's
 a
 shot.


Feels
 like
 there's
 a
 shot.
 BMR
 is
 also


moving
 as
 well.
 Yep.
 Bit
 mine
 5356.


5356.


Where's
 Eli
 Liy?
 Okay,
 so
 the
 drugs
 are


kind
 of
 down
 today,
 1.4%.
 How
 about


HIMS?


Hims
 is
 up
 2%.
 Hims
 still
 below
 50.
 That


one's
 been
 struggling
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks.
 New
 bank,
 that's
 back


above
 16.
 They
 had
 a
 good
 earnings
 a


couple
 months
 ago,
 so
 that's
 helping


out.
 DLO,
 that's
 up.
 Also,
 Micardo


Libre,
 a
 Malay
 one
 in
 uh
 in
 Argentina.


So,
 that
 is
 helping
 Micardo
 Libre
 today


as
 a
 libertarian
 was
 elected
 president


again
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 you
 know
 the


business
 community
 is
 happy
 about
 that.


So,
 Mart
 Libre
 right
 there
 getting
 a
 gap


up
 after
 pretty
 you
 know
 having
 a
 pretty


nasty
 week.
 683
 on
 the
 S&P


and
 that
 one
 going
 green.
 Beyond
 Meat,


is
 that
 one
 green?
 Beyond
 Meat
 goes


green.


Power
 to
 the
 players.
 There
 you
 go.


Beyond
 Meat
 after
 going
 down.
 I
 mean,


dude,
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 Beyond
 Meat


story
 is
 fully
 finished
 yet.
 I'm
 not
 in


the
 stock,
 but
 when
 something
 is
 shorted


161%,


they
 need
 a
 Roaring
 Kitty.
 I
 don't
 know


who's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 roaring
 kitty
 of


Beyond
 Meat.
 But
 if
 they
 had
 a
 Roaring


Kitty
 to
 really
 galvanize
 the
 masses,


maybe
 this
 could
 get
 some
 momentum.


I
 mean,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that


feel
 like
 this
 is
 the
 next
 best
 short


squeeze.


I
 just
 don't
 know
 if
 there's
 like
 a
 real


exciting
 story.
 Like
 GameStop
 there,
 you


know,
 this
 whole
 power
 to
 the
 players.


There's
 like
 this
 exciting
 narrative


beyond
 I
 mean,
 like
 Beyond
 Meat
 is


about,
 you
 know,
 not
 eating
 chicken.


Like
 it's
 it's
 it's
 it's
 a
 question
 of


how
 much
 do
 people
 resonate
 with
 that


story.


But
 I
 do
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 need
 a


ring
 leader
 here
 to
 get
 people
 excited.


Where
 is
 ASST?


That
 stock
 145
 still
 up
 30%
 on
 the
 day.


So
 that
 one
 looking
 like
 it's
 holding


the
 30%
 move
 right
 there.
 So
 back
 to
 30.


Back
 to
 30.
 If
 you're
 going
 to
 do
 sports


betting,
 why
 not
 bet
 on
 this?
 I
 mean,


look,
 it's
 it's
 a
 fair
 comparison.
 You


can
 make
 the
 argument
 that
 sports


betting
 is
 similar
 to
 betting
 on
 some
 of


these
 momentum
 stocks.


I
 do
 think,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 know
 a


little
 bit
 about
 the
 team
 in
 the
 sport


and
 you
 can
 say
 there's
 some
 riskreward


based
 on
 understanding
 the
 players
 and


the
 psychology,
 all
 that.
 I
 mean,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 ways
 you
 can


make
 a
 scientific
 argument
 around
 sports


betting,


but
 you
 could
 also
 say
 the
 same
 that
 if


a
 stock
 is
 short
 at
 161%
 and
 enough


people
 tend
 to
 buy
 it,
 you're
 going to


have
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 squeeze.
 So,
 I
 think


that's
 some
 of
 the
 excitement
 you
 have


there


on
 Beyond
 Meat.


Sports
 also
 might
 be
 rigged
 though
 as
 as


for
 this
 NBA
 [ __ ]
 Dude,
 this
 story
 has


been
 crazy.
 You
 got
 people
 making
 Terry


Rosier
 by
 the
 way,
 the
 guy
 who
 was


arrested,
 he
 makes
 $26
 million
 a
 year.


So,
 the
 idea
 like
 the
 fact
 that
 he's


engaged
 in
 this
 in
 this
 betting
 is
 crazy


to
 me
 because
 he
 makes
 so
 much
 money.


But
 I
 guess
 that's
 the,
 you
 know,
 that's


the
 route
 that
 he
 wants
 to
 go.
 Uh,
 Intel


got
 a
 price
 target
 upgrade
 from
 25
 to


35.
 This
 is
 from
 Barclays.
 That's
 green


on
 the
 day.
 Also,
 Redcat,
 we
 got
 to
 deal


with
 Pounder.
 Redcat
 completes
 multi-day


tests
 of
 Pounder
 V-NAV
 software
 on
 Black


Widow
 Drone,
 paving
 way
 for
 formal
 US


Army
 demonstration.
 We've
 interviewed


the
 Redcat
 CEO
 before.
 Maybe
 we'll
 try


to
 interview
 him
 again.
 He's
 been
 on
 the


channel
 and
 uh
 you
 know,
 the
 drone
 space


is
 very
 hot.
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


in
 Andos
 and
 a
 bunch
 of
 these
 other


drone
 names
 that
 have
 started
 to
 do
 very


well.
 Onoss
 right
 here,
 up
 10%
 on
 the


day.
 I
 think
 they
 also
 signed
 another


partnership
 this
 morning.


So,
 we'll
 see
 if
 we
 can
 talk
 to
 him,
 but


it
 looks
 like
 they
 have
 a
 partnership


with
 Palenter.
 Amcor
 will
 have
 earnings


today
 at
 4
 p.m.
 So,
 we'll
 take
 a
 look
 at


their
 earnings.


Where
 is
 Netflix?
 Are
 we
 still
 green?


Netflix.
 Wow.
 Netflix
 still
 not


recovering.
 The
 only
 reason
 they
 missed


earnings
 is
 because
 of
 the
 Brazilian
 tax


authorities
 and
 the
 market
 is
 still
 not


giving
 them
 any
 sympathy


below,
 1100
 now


on
 uh
 on
 Netflix.


Qualcomm,
 we
 have
 an
 update
 as
 well.


Qualcomm
 unveils
 two
 AI
 chips
 for
 data


centers.
 AI
 200
 and
 AI250
 with


commercial
 availability
 from
 next
 year.


The
 new
 chips
 are
 designed
 for
 improved


memory
 capacity
 and
 running
 AI


applications
 or
 inference
 and
 will
 be


available
 in
 26
 and
 27.
 Apple
 is
 one
 of


the
 biggest
 buyers
 of
 those
 Qualcomm


chips.
 So
 you
 got
 Qualcomm
 right
 there.


Wow,
 look
 at
 that.
 4%
 up
 on
 the
 day.


Street
 seems
 to
 be
 liking
 that
 news


right
 there.
 You
 got
 a
 move
 literally


five
 minutes
 ago
 based
 on
 that
 headline.


Uh
 these
 are
 inference
 chips.
 So


there
 is
 obviously
 massive
 demand


for
 inference
 as
 we
 get
 to
 the
 next


next
 level
 of
 training
 these
 models
 now


up
 5%
 on
 the
 day
 and
 Apple
 with
 their
 M5


chip
 if
 their
 products
 continue
 to
 have


more
 demand
 that
 could
 also
 be
 a
 bullish


tailwind
 for
 Qualcomm.
 SMCI
 up
 6%.
 SMCI


and
 Qualcomm
 the
 biggest
 semiconductor


movers
 on
 for
 the
 day.


Wow
 look
 at
 that
 178.
 Is
 that
 kind
 of


competitive
 with
 AMD?


I've
 I
 mean,
 I
 knew
 Qualcomm
 had
 chips,


but
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 way
 the
 street's


acting,
 these
 chips,
 they
 seem
 to
 be


thinking,
 hey,
 maybe
 OpenAI
 would
 buy


these
 chips
 potentially.
 Maybe
 Anthropic


would
 buy
 these
 chips.
 I
 mean,
 there
 is


a
 bit
 of
 excitement
 the
 street
 seems
 to


be
 happening
 having
 on
 these


on
 these
 updates.
 By
 the
 way,
 Enthropic


right
 here,
 uh,
 speaking
 of
 them,
 they


said,
 "Today
 we
 announced
 that
 we
 plan


to
 expand
 our
 use
 of
 Google
 TPUs,


securing
 approximately
 1
 million
 TPUs


and
 more
 than
 a
 gigawatt
 of
 capacity
 in


2026."
 They
 said
 that
 back
 on
 Friday.


I
 mean,
 look,
 dude,
 we've
 had
 this


conversation
 before
 around
 Google.
 Could


they
 become
 the
 world's
 largest
 company


ahead
 of
 Nvidia?


And
 they
 are
 a
 bit
 away
 at
 3.2
 trillion


versus
 4.6.
 But
 my
 goodness,
 was
 Google


not
 the
 best
 Mac
 7
 buy
 this
 year?


This
 thing
 was
 trading
 at
 15
 times


forward
 earnings.
 15
 times


and
 it
 was
 stuck
 at
 150.
 Got
 to
 145
 at


one
 point
 basically
 for
 the
 majority
 of


the
 year.


And
 now
 they're
 getting
 anthropic
 to
 buy


a
 million
 of
 their
 TPUs.


I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 just
 incredible.
 And


maybe
 Amazon's
 next
 at
 being
 able
 to


have
 somewhat
 of
 a
 move
 that's
 like


that.
 But
 my
 goodness,
 if
 you're
 long


Google,
 you've
 got
 to
 be
 happy.
 You've


got
 to
 be
 happy.
 You
 just
 stuck
 with


your
 due
 diligence
 and
 believed
 that
 any


narrative
 around
 a
 company
 doing
 100


billion
 in
 net
 income
 probably
 was
 not


the
 best
 narrative
 to
 latch
 on
 to.


Qualcomm
 right
 there
 up
 7%.
 Street


really
 likes
 this
 chip
 news.


Suchin
 says
 difference
 between
 AMD
 and


Qualcomm
 on
 data
 center
 chip
 is
 as
 much


as
 much
 as
 Nvidia
 has
 a
 lead
 over
 AMD.


Okay,
 so
 Suchin
 saying
 AMD
 probably
 is


in
 a
 much
 better
 position
 than
 Qualcomm,


which
 I
 would
 agree
 with
 just


anecdotally
 from
 what
 I've
 seen
 with


AMD.
 But
 the
 street
 is
 thinking
 that


they're
 going
 to
 have
 some
 real


potential
 opportunities
 to
 sell
 this


AI250
 chip


into
 the
 ecosystem.
 179


right
 there
 on
 Qualcomm.


Applovin
 is
 down.
 Just
 fell
 from
 640
 to


624.
 So
 you
 got
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 red
 candle


right
 there.
 That
 one
 took
 a
 hit.
 Yep.


We
 talked
 about
 the
 Poland
 defense


contract
 with
 Palier.
 That
 could
 also
 be


another
 reason
 why
 that's
 green
 today.


and
 you're
 getting
 some
 love.
 Suchin


also
 said,
 "My
 first
 bet
 is
 PayPal
 will


move
 close
 to
 100
 by
 middle
 of
 next


year.
 The
 leaps
 will
 be
 2x
 so
 I
 can
 take


my
 original
 capital
 out."
 Okay,
 so
 he


bought
 the
 110
 leap
 on
 PayPal
 for


January
 2028.
 He
 believes
 PayPal
 once
 it


gets
 to
 100
 will
 2x
 the
 leaps
 so
 he
 can


take
 out
 his
 initial
 and
 then
 he
 can
 let


the
 rest
 ride
 as
 house
 money,


which
 would
 be
 assuming
 a
 decent
 level


of
 upside
 going
 into
 next
 year
 from
 70


to
 100
 on
 PayPal.


They
 have
 earnings
 uh
 tomorrow.


So,
 this
 is
 gonna
 be
 the
 biggest


earnings
 ever
 for
 PayPal
 because
 at
 this


point
 the
 stock
 has
 been
 so
 stuck
 that


people
 are
 really
 wondering
 will
 this


thing
 ever
 have
 any
 bit
 of
 a
 move.


And
 if
 tomorrow
 is
 the
 day
 where


transaction
 margins,
 transaction


volumes,
 monthly
 users,
 something
 gets


the
 street
 to
 be
 more
 excited.
 Stable


coins
 potentially,
 you
 never
 know.
 Maybe


maybe
 they
 print
 $300
 trillion
 of
 market


cap.
 Who
 knows
 that?
 Maybe
 that
 can
 get


the
 street
 to
 start
 getting
 excited.


Oh,
 gold
 is
 down.


Wow,
 gold
 is
 five
 bucks
 away
 from
 losing


4,000,
 folks.
 That
 is
 a,
 if
 I'm
 not


wrong.


Um,


that
 is
 a


$560
 billion
 decline
 in
 the
 past
 couple


hours
 on
 gold.


So
 you
 got
 some
 red
 right
 there
 with


silver.
 Same
 thing
 with
 silver.
 4680.


The
 the the
 the
 the
 commodities
 trade


has
 not
 really
 recovered


in
 the
 past
 week
 even
 though
 equities


have.


Wow.
 S&P
 68340.
 My
 goodness.


She's
 pushing
 684.


Okay.
 Here's
 a
 question
 for
 everybody.


For
 the
 next
 year,
 would
 you
 rather
 buy


gold
 or
 PayPal?
 Put
 in
 the
 chat.
 Gold
 or


PayPal?
 I'll
 do
 a
 poll.
 92%
 of
 you,
 by


the
 way,
 said
 green
 for
 the
 day.
 Gold
 or


PayPal.


I
 mean,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 lie.


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 lie.
 I
 think
 I'm
 going


with
 PayPal,
 bro.
 I
 think
 I
 mean,
 PayPal


is
 under
 freaking
 valued.
 We
 all
 know


that.
 They
 just
 their
 narrative
 has
 kind


of
 sucked
 over
 the
 past
 year.
 I'm
 not


saying
 gold
 is
 overvalued
 because
 it's


gold,
 right?
 And
 gold
 will
 always
 be


gold.
 But
 give
 me
 PayPal
 for
 the
 next


year
 over
 gold.


And
 I'm
 I
 don't
 even
 think
 I'm
 saying


this
 because
 gold
 is
 down
 2%
 on
 the
 day.


If
 gold
 was
 up
 2%
 on
 the
 day,
 I
 think
 I


would
 still
 say
 PayPal
 because
 like
 why


would
 you
 want
 to
 buy
 something
 that's


up
 that
 much
 for
 the
 year
 when
 central


banks
 have
 already
 loaded
 the
 boat?
 If


by
 the
 way,
 if
 there's
 any
 level
 of


weakness
 in
 the
 economy
 and
 and
 no
 one,


you
 know,
 no
 one's
 a
 psychic.
 We
 don't


know
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 2026.


What
 do
 you
 think
 central
 banks
 are


going
 to
 rush
 to
 sell?


I
 mean,
 they've
 loaded
 up
 on
 gold.


They're
 probably
 up
 a
 you
 know,
 you


would
 imagine
 the
 average
 central
 bank


is
 up
 minimum
 20
 to
 30%
 if
 they've
 been


buying
 since
 2024,
 which
 is
 looks
 like


that's
 been
 the
 trend
 of
 how
 it's
 been


playing
 out.
 They're
 probably
 going
 to


take
 some
 profits
 on
 gold


and
 that
 could,
 you
 know,
 reacelerate


some
 of
 the
 downside
 pressure
 on
 the


asset.


But
 you
 do
 have
 Morgan
 Stanley
 that's


pretty
 bullish.
 They
 think
 it
 can
 get
 to


or
 JP
 Morgan,
 they
 say
 it
 can
 get
 to


5,000
 by
 the
 end
 of the
 year.


You
 know,
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 that,
 it
 could


just
 be
 taking
 a
 breather.
 Nvidia
 right


there,
 190.
 Pounder,
 still
 holding
 191.


Not
 giving
 it
 up
 today.
 Still
 holding


191.
 And
 then
 hoodie
 14739.


Uh,
 Amit,
 did
 you
 hear
 about
 the
 new
 ARM


deal?
 I
 did
 not.
 ARM
 right
 here
 up


2.65%.


Looks
 like
 they
 did
 get
 upgraded
 this


morning
 to
 200.
 Qualcomm
 still
 running.


Yeah,
 it
 looks
 like
 they
 got
 the
 price


target
 upgrade
 of
 200.
 That's
 what's


also
 helping
 ARM.
 Will
 they
 sell
 gold


for
 dollars?
 No,
 they
 would
 sell
 it
 for


liquidity.
 It's
 not
 like
 they
 would
 sell


it
 to
 buy
 something
 else.
 They
 would


sell
 it
 to
 Well,
 in
 2011,
 right,
 they


sold
 it
 because
 they
 had
 to
 restimulate


their
 economies
 and
 they
 needed
 more


money
 to
 pump
 into
 the
 system.
 They


needed
 to
 get
 the
 money
 from
 somewhere.


I'm
 not
 saying
 we
 would
 have
 a
 2011


event.
 But
 if
 you
 do
 have
 any
 level
 of


weakness,
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 the


United
 States
 central
 bank.
 could
 be


China
 saying,
 "Hey,
 we're
 going
 to
 sell


some
 gold
 and
 do
 something
 else
 with
 it


instead
 of
 just
 holding
 on
 to
 it
 as
 a


reserve
 asset."


Now,
 granted,
 given
 that
 it's
 run
 so


much,
 I
 mean,
 like,
 maybe
 the
 psychology


has
 changed
 of
 it
 being
 a
 riskoff
 asset


and,
 you
 know,
 banks
 being
 a
 lot
 more


conducive
 to
 the
 idea
 of
 just
 holding
 it


for
 a
 very
 long
 time,
 just
 like
 they


think
 of
 US
 treasuries,
 which
 by
 the


way,
 where
 is
 the
 10-year
 beyond
 133


million
 in
 volume?
 My
 goodness.
 10
 year


back
 above
 4%.
 All right,
 makes
 sense.


You
 probably
 got
 people
 selling
 off


bonds
 and
 buying
 stocks
 right
 now


causing
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 excitement


to
 the
 upside
 on
 the
 10-year.


Um


Oscar,


what
 do
 we
 got?
 Oscar
 is
 green
 1945
 up


8%
 as
 that
 one
 is
 now
 moving
 150.


What's
 the
 volume?
 Wow.
 420
 million


shares
 have
 been
 traded
 of
 ASST.


Dude,
 it
 really
 goes
 to
 show
 how


excitement


can
 spread
 easily


in
 regards
 to
 the
 broader
 market,


especially
 when
 someone
 influential


takes
 position
 on
 a
 name.


Gold
 will
 continue
 to
 go
 up.
 The
 great


meltup
 is
 happening
 and
 gold
 is
 the


ultimate
 asset.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 basically


what
 JP
 Morgan
 said.
 They
 said
 gold
 is


likely
 not
 to
 face
 the
 types
 of


headwinds
 that
 the
 equity
 markets
 would


face
 because
 it's
 being
 seen
 as
 this


reserve
 asset,


>> which
 is
 a
 fair
 point.
 I
 mean,
 that's


how
 the
 market
 is
 treating
 it.
 And
 given


the
 central
 bank
 stuff,
 it
 looks
 like


that's
 not
 that's
 not
 slowing
 down.
 Path


is
 moving.
 Path
 is
 up.


Path.
 Wow.

 This
 thing
 was
 15
 last


night.
 Look
 at
 that.

 Qualcomm
 that
 one
 still
 getting
 a


move
 based
 on
 that
 result.
 Wow.
 190
 12%.


Dude,
 this
 thing
 was
 at
 175
 two
 minutes


ago.
 I
 think
 the
 street's
 really


thinking
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 meaningful


competitor,
 even
 though
 there
 might
 not


be
 enough
 evidence
 of
 that


to
 some
 of
 the
 other
 inference
 training


chips
 that
 are
 out
 there.


Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 I
 think
 they're


thinking
 Qualcomm's
 going
 to
 try
 to
 take


on
 Nvidia
 and
 AMD
 to
 an
 extent.


Even
 the
 perception
 of
 that
 is
 causing


that
 type
 of
 boom.


Even
 the
 perception
 of
 that
 is
 causing


an
 aggressive
 boom.


I'd
 buy
 gold
 again
 at
 3,000.
 I
 don't


know if
 we
 get
 to
 3,000.
 3,000
 feels
 a


bit
 aggressive.


I
 also
 I
 mean
 look
 I
 feel
 like
 it's


healthy
 for
 gold
 to
 take
 a
 little
 bit
 of


a
 retracement.
 I
 mean
 it's
 been
 up
 like


crazy
 just
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 momentum


names
 you
 need
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 pain
 a


pain
 to
 get
 some
 gains
 but
 it
 would
 be


the
 first
 time
 in
 a
 few
 months
 seeing
 it


get
 below
 4,000.


I
 just
 don't
 know
 if
 we
 get
 that
 low


back
 to
 3,000.
 Qualcomm
 now
 191.
 Is
 this


alltime
 highs?


This
 is
 no.
 It
 got
 up
 to
 230
 back
 in
 24.


Now
 it's
 at
 192.
 Got
 to
 a
 low
 of
 120
 in


April.
 Huh.


120
 in
 April.
 191
 right
 here.
 Nebia
 is


still
 holding
 192.
 AMD
 is
 going
 down.


AMD
 looks
 like
 it's
 about
 to
 go
 red.


That
 would
 be
 pretty
 telling
 if
 Qualcomm


goes
 green
 and
 AMD
 goes
 red.
 Nvidia


still
 holding
 190.
 Nvidia
 a
 little
 bit


of
 red
 candle
 as
 well
 though.
 And
 then


you
 got
 Tesla
 trying
 to
 break
 450.


Qualcomm
 does
 not
 report
 today.
 Uh,


Cadence
 reports
 today.
 Cadence
 is


another
 semiconductor
 design
 company,


but
 Qualcomm
 reports
 I
 think
 in
 two


weeks.
 Kathy
 Wood
 bought
 Qualcomm
 last


week.


Well,
 maybe
 they
 were
 diversifying
 their


inference
 training
 chip
 investments.
 And


you
 got
 Qualcomm
 really
 getting
 some


love
 right
 here.

 I
 mean
 IWM
 looks
 like
 it's
 really


prime

 as
 these

 come


in
 to
 give
 some
 momentum.

Uh,
 let's
 look
 at
 the
 stock
 draft.
 What


do
 we
 have
 there?


Oh,
 wow.
 We're
 close
 to
 Matt.
 Matt's
 at


454.
 I'm
 at

Pounder
 and

 obviously
 helping
 a
 lot


today
 along
 with
 Tesla
 and
 AMD
 and


Nebius.
 Um,
 Steve's

 Tanner's
 at


26.4,
 Chris
 is
 at
 11.3.
 Matt

beating
 me
 by
 about
 1%.
 Rock
 Lab
 and
 AS.


And
 then
 Dutch
 Bros.
 He
 was
 down
 a
 lot


on
 that.
 Dutch
 Bros
 starting
 to
 recover.


So
 that's
 helping
 as
 well.


Okay.
 What
 did
 you
 guys
 say
 on
 PayPal


versus


versus
 gold?
 Wow.
 6040.


PayPal
 over
 gold.


6040.


Okay,
 there
 you
 go.


Not
 too
 bad.
 Qualcomm
 15%.


I
 mean,
 dude,
 if
 if
 if
 I
 thought
 this


was
 the
 AMD
 killer,
 I
 would
 have
 bought


some
 right
 before
 this
 runup.


But
 that's
 what
 it's
 being
 perceived
 as


like
 an
 AMD
 killer
 or
 something.
 Not


literally
 an
 AMD
 killer,
 but
 it's
 being


perceived
 as
 a
 really
 big
 threat
 to
 AMD


and
 Nvidia,
 I
 would
 imagine.
 Otherwise,


a
 name
 like
 this
 doesn't
 move
 15%
 that


often.
 Market
 cap
 211
 billion.


Qualcomm
 is
 not
 the
 most
 volatile
 name.


It
 tends
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 more
 relaxed,


especially
 on
 earnings.
 It
 doesn't
 even


move
 like
 that.
 So
 very
 unusual
 for
 the


market
 to
 think
 this
 is
 that
 exciting


but
 they
 are
 giving


they
 are
 giving
 it
 a
 premium.
 Uh
 let's


get
 an
 update
 right
 here
 on
 Qualcomm
 and


let's
 see
 some
 coverage


on
 why
 the
 street
 is
 this
 excited


>> that
 built
 its
 empire
 on
 smartphones.
 So


they're
 launching
 new
 data
 center
 AI


chips
 starting
 in
 2026.
 And
 they
 also


just
 announced
 their
 first
 major


customer.
 That
 would
 be
 Saudi
 backed
 AI


startup
 Humane
 targeting
 roughly
 200


megawatts
 of
 capacity
 starting
 in
 2026.


So
 they're
 not
 essentially
 going
 after


AI
 training.
 That's
 the
 market
 that
 made


Nvidia
 worth
 over
 $4
 trillion.
 Qualcomm


is
 targeting
 inference.
 That's
 running


AI
 models,
 not
 necessarily
 building


them.
 So
 every
 time
 you
 use
 chat
 GPT
 or


generate
 an
 AI
 image,
 that's
 inference.


So
 training
 builds
 the
 models.
 Inference


uses
 them
 billions
 of
 times
 a
 day.


Qualcomm
 thinks
 the
 market
 is
 going
 to


be
 enormous.
 Nearly
 6
 trillion
 almost
 7


trillion
 dollars
 in
 data
 center
 spending


is
 expected
 through
 2030
 according
 to


McKenzie.
 And
 so
 just
 capturing
 about
 5


to
 10%
 maybe
 just
 even
 5%
 of
 that
 market


would
 transform
 Qualcomm's
 business.


Their
 products
 are
 complete
 server


systems
 based
 on
 their
 hexagon
 NPU.
 So


that'd
 be
 neural
 processing
 unit
 chips


already
 used
 in
 billions
 of
 smartphones


around
 the
 world.
 One
 key
 advantage,
 and


this
 is
 where
 it
 gets
 a
 little


technical,
 it's
 a
 768
 gigabytes
 of


memory
 per
 card.
 They're
 saying
 that's


more
 than
 what
 Nvidia
 and
 AMD
 offer
 in


this
 particular
 uh
 rack
 type
 setting.


That
 matters
 though
 for
 running
 larger


AI
 models.
 And
 so
 this
 is
 where
 Qualcomm


hopes
 to
 compete.
 They'll
 sell
 these


complete
 systems
 that
 you're
 seeing
 on


your
 screen
 right
 now
 for
 or
 also


individual
 components.
 Qualcomm
 says


even
 Nvidia
 or
 AMD
 could
 become


customers
 for
 some
 of
 their
 parts.
 But


the
 timing
 really
 matters
 because
 for


example,
 OpenAI
 recently
 announced
 it's


buying
 chips
 from
 AMD,
 showing
 big
 AI


companies
 want
 alternatives
 to
 Nvidia,


especially
 within
 the
 inference
 market.


But
 Qualcomm
 only
 named
 one
 customer
 so


far.
 There's
 no
 pricing
 details.
 They're


launching
 in
 2026,
 which
 is
 years
 behind


Nvidia's
 dominance,
 but
 there's
 no


taking
 away
 from
 the
 fact
 that
 this
 is
 a


big
 new
 market
 for
 Qualcomm
 guys.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 mean
 as
 you
 point
 out


Christina
 no
 shortage
 of
 potential


competitors
 obviously
 AMD
 and
 Nvidia
 but


others
 as
 well
 and
 we
 you
 know
 sometimes


I
 don't
 think
 we
 talk
 enough
 about
 the


fact
 that
 Alphabet
 I
 mean
 their
 TPU
 is


for
 inference
 as
 well
 right
 and
 gives


them
 potentially
 a
 leg
 up
 to
 a
 certain


extent
 this
 is
 kind
 of a
 different


subject
 but
 on
 a
 cost
 per
 token
 basis
 in


terms
 of
 what
 it
 costs
 them
 and
 a
 lot
 of


this
 goes
 back
 to
 that
 I
 guess
 for
 the


hyperscalers


what
 is
 your
 you
 know
 what's
 the
 cost


per
 token
 going
 to
 be
 I
 don't
 know
 where


this
 thing's
 going
 to
 get
 priced
 and


what
 it's
 going to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 but


that
 will
 become
 important.


>> Yeah.
 Normally
 in
 the
 chip
 world
 they


refer
 to
 it
 as
 total
 cost
 of
 ownership


TCO
 and
 so
 Qualcomm
 didn't
 provide


specific
 details.
 A
 lot
 of
 companies
 how


they
 benchmark
 it
 is
 different.
 They're


saying
 that
 the
 total
 cost
 of
 ownership


will
 be
 cheaper
 uh
 because
 of
 the
 power


efficiency
 of
 said
 chips
 because
 these


aren't


>> gold
 below
 4,000.
 First
 time
 in
 a
 couple


months,
 gold
 below
 4,000.


>> GPUs
 that
 are
 using
 ex
 a
 lot
 more
 power.


The
 NPUs
 and
 more
 custommade
 chips
 tend


to
 use
 a
 lot
 less.
 So,
 that's
 going to


be
 their
 selling
 point
 going
 forward.


I'm
 sure
 in
 the
 coming
 months
 they'll


reveal
 some
 more
 data
 around
 that.
 But


to
 your
 point,
 Google
 really
 stands
 out.


Even
 Jensen
 Wong
 from
 Nvidia
 has
 spoken


many
 times
 about
 just
 how
 advanced


Google
 has
 become
 in
 the
 TPU
 market
 and


just
 they've
 been
 here
 for
 a
 long
 time.


This
 isn't
 a
 company
 that
 just
 made
 a


chip
 uh
 you
 know,
 five
 years
 ago.
 So,


uh,
 that's
 another
 company
 to
 look
 out


for.
 No
 doubt.


>> Yeah.
 Cost
 per
 dollar
 per
 watt.
 It


>> I
 know
 it
 gets
 confusing.
 Yeah.
 Just


know.


>> All right.
 What
 are
 we
 thinking?
 Do
 we


think
 it's
 hype?
 Oh
 my
 goodness.
 203.


>> What
 do
 we
 guys
 think?


>> Do
 we
 think
 this
 is
 hype
 for
 Qualcomm
 or


do
 we
 think
 they
 just
 entered
 into
 the


race
 with
 Nvidia
 and
 AMD?


Dude,
 who
 would
 have
 thought
 Qualcomm


enters
 the
 race?
 20%
 move,
 $31
 up
 on
 the


day
 and
 completely
 sends
 a
 surprise
 to


semiconductor
 investors
 that
 maybe


didn't
 think
 Qualcomm
 was
 going
 to
 be


competing
 with
 uh
 the
 biggest
 chip


companies
 in
 the
 world.
 Let's
 put
 the


poll
 in
 the
 chat.
 60%
 of
 you
 said
 PayPal


over
 gold.
 Is
 Qualcomm
 just
 hype?


When
 I
 mean
 just
 hype,
 I
 don't
 mean
 the


the
 company
 itself.
 company
 is
 a


phenomenal
 company.
 But
 is
 this
 move


18%
 off
 of
 the
 introduction
 of
 new


chips?


The
 market
 saying,
 "Hey,
 we
 need
 to
 be


precautious
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 AMD
 might


lose
 some
 market
 share,
 for
 example,
 and


we
 need
 to
 buy
 its
 competitor
 in
 terms


of
 Qualcomm.
 Look
 at
 Nvidia
 losing
 190


because
 of
 this
 Qualcomm
 [ __ ]
 AMD


losing
 258
 because
 of
 Qualcomm."


Yeah,
 I'd
 be
 very
 curious
 for
 Jose's


perspective
 on
 this.
 I
 mean,
 we've


talked
 about
 Qualcomm
 a
 couple
 times
 on


the
 channel
 with
 him,
 but
 he's
 never


mentioned
 them.
 The
 extent
 of
 him


mentioning
 Qualcomm
 as
 a
 massive
 winner


is
 always
 in
 the
 context
 of
 Apple.
 He's


never
 really
 mentioned
 them


independently.
 At least
 I
 don't
 remember


him
 saying,
 "Yeah,
 Qualcomm's
 one
 you


got
 to
 look
 out
 for."
 So,
 this
 is
 a


pretty
 big
 update
 today


in
 the
 chip
 sector.
 202
 up
 19%.
 By
 the


way,
 Oaklo
 just
 went
 red.
 Oaklo
 just


went
 red.
 So,
 some
 of
 those
 momentum


names
 we
 talked
 about
 last
 week,
 even
 in


the
 midst
 of
 S&P
 500
 at
 all-time
 highs,


they're
 not
 really
 able
 to
 keep
 up
 their


momentum


as
 they
 are
 going
 red.
 Same
 thing
 with


Big
 Bear
 AI,


which
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 that


says
 about
 the
 broader
 market.
 I
 would,


my
 gut
 tells
 me
 that's
 not
 the
 worst


thing
 for
 alltime
 highs
 on
 the
 S&P


because
 some
 of
 those
 names
 maybe


they're
 not
 going to
 recapture
 the
 exact


levels
 they
 were
 at.
 But
 as
 long
 as
 the


Nvidas,
 the
 Googles,
 the
 Amazons
 don't


go
 red,
 because
 if
 those
 names
 go
 red,


those
 are
 the
 S&P,
 right?
 Then
 the
 S&P


is
 probably
 going
 red.
 Some
 of
 the
 other


names
 go
 red.
 It's
 like
 it
 shouldn't


affect
 the
 broader
 bull
 trend,


which
 should
 be
 very
 important.


Um,


I'm
 shorting
 Qualcomm
 to
 180.
 Is
 it
 a


short
 though?
 Like,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's


a
 short.


Maybe
 it's
 not
 a
 buy
 into
 the
 hype.


I
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 a
 short.
 I
 don't


know if
 this
 thing
 is
 something
 you
 you


bet
 against
 as
 easily.


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a
 short,
 guys.
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 know.


I
 think
 if
 they
 announce
 any
 level
 of


increased
 guidance
 in
 their
 in
 their


upcoming
 quarter
 based
 on
 these
 new


chips,
 Street's
 going
 to
 buy
 it
 up.


She's
 going
 to
 be
 very
 excited
 to
 buy
 it


up.
 By
 the
 way,
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 Nvidia


is
 getting
 a
 little
 weak
 right
 here,
 but


this
 is
 the
 best
 time
 of
 the
 year
 for


Nvidia.
 Over
 the
 last
 19
 years
 of
 Nvidia


being
 a
 public
 company,
 if
 you
 take
 a


look
 at
 this
 chart,
 the
 next
 two
 weeks


that
 we
 are
 getting
 into
 have
 averaged


an
 8%
 move
 on
 Nvidia
 with
 a
 71%
 win


rate.
 That
 would
 be
 well
 into
 the
 $200


range,
 which
 would
 be
 basically
 a
 $5


trillion
 company
 if
 we
 break
 above
 204.


So,
 the
 next
 two
 weeks,
 70%
 of
 the
 time,


Nvidia
 moves
 8%.
 I
 mean,
 that
 could
 be


pretty
 bullish.
 But
 now
 you
 got
 this


Qualcomm
 argument
 in
 the
 mix
 that
 maybe


makes
 it
 harder


for
 Nvidia
 to
 get
 that
 type
 of
 run.


It
 looks
 like
 they're
 going to
 show


something
 soon.
 It's
 re
 if
 it's
 real,


you
 could
 be
 cooked
 on
 a
 short.
 Yeah.


Also,
 Jensen,
 by
 the
 way,
 is
 speaking
 at


GTC
 tomorrow.
 Uh
 I'll
 be
 streaming
 that


tomorrow.
 Uh
 I
 think
 that'll
 be


happening
 right
 after
 the
 market
 open.


And
 um
 he'll
 be
 live
 with
 a
 bunch
 of


companies.
 I
 mean,
 he's
 going
 to
 be
 live


with
 some
 quantum
 players
 as
 well.
 So,


if
 you're
 shorting
 Quantum,
 maybe
 not


the
 best
 idea
 tomorrow.


It's
 not
 the
 best
 idea
 after
 the


government
 said
 they
 might
 backs
 stop


the
 Quantum
 names
 and
 if
 Jensen
 is


interviewing
 one
 of
 the
 Quantum
 CEOs


live
 on
 GTC,
 all
 the
 Quantum
 names
 might


get
 a
 boost
 just
 based
 on
 that
 alone.


So,
 again,
 like
 there
 there's
 a


difference
 between
 thinking
 some


valuations
 in
 this
 market
 are
 a
 bit


frothy
 and
 probably
 need
 a
 pullback


versus
 going
 net
 short.
 And
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 the
 people
 that
 have
 lost
 money


this
 year,
 even
 if
 theoretically
 they


could
 be
 right
 about
 whatever
 thesis


they
 have,
 is
 just
 going
 short
 in
 a
 bull


market
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 names,
 doesn't
 tend


to
 work,
 no
 matter
 how
 speculative
 you


think
 the
 name
 is.


And
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 short
 Qualcomm
 is


the
 is
 the
 player
 right
 there.


Um,


Nvidia
 already
 won,
 others
 are
 playing


for
 second
 place.
 Yes,
 that's
 true.
 But


Nvidia,
 for
 them
 to
 keep
 winning,


they've
 got
 to
 show
 consistent
 growth.


And
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 the
 market
 always


gets
 scared
 if
 there's
 ever,
 you
 know,
 a


hindrance
 to
 that
 growth.
 That's


basically
 what
 we
 saw
 with
 the
 Deep


Seek.


So,
 I'm
 excited
 to
 see
 excited
 to
 see


how
 this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.


Bring
 Skrey
 for
 the
 Quantum
 tomorrow.


Dude,
 he
 he
 finally
 got
 unbanned
 on
 Wall


Street
 Bets
 and
 he
 put
 out
 this
 long


post
 saying
 that
 he's
 short
 all
 the


quantum
 stocks
 and
 they're
 going
 to


zero.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 dude,
 D-Wave's
 up


8%
 today.
 Like,
 I
 even
 though
 I
 may


disagree
 with
 the
 valuation
 of
 some
 of


the
 quantum
 names,
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a


short
 shorting
 these
 names.
 And
 I
 I


think,
 you
 know,
 I've
 been
 pretty


consistent
 about
 that
 since
 September
 of


last
 year.
 Shorting
 these
 names
 is


asking
 for
 trouble.
 It's
 It's
 like
 the


people
 that
 went
 shorter.
 Like,
 look,


Pounder's
 valuation
 is
 aggressive.
 It's


a
 $450
 billion
 company
 doing
 four


billion
 in
 revenue.
 No
 one
 will
 tell
 you


it's
 not
 aggressive.


But
 what's
 their
 name?
 Andrew
 left


Citron
 shorting
 it.
 I
 mean,
 first
 of


all,
 we
 haven't
 got
 an
 update
 in
 over


two
 months
 on
 their
 short.
 Second
 of


all,
 it's
 like,
 dude,
 if
 there's


catalysts
 in
 the
 in
 the
 in
 the
 playbook


on
 a
 company,
 whether
 it's
 quantum,


Palenteer,
 whatever
 it
 is,


that
 perception
 is
 more
 reality
 than
 the


actual
 fundamentals
 of
 reality.
 Now,


Palenteer
 just
 has
 really
 good


fundamentals,
 which
 is
 why
 it's
 allowing


to
 expand
 that
 multiple.
 But
 shorting


these
 names
 doesn't
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.


It
 really
 doesn't
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.


EOS
 that's
 also
 up
 on
 the
 day.
 I
 mean


EOSC's
 valuation
 is
 also
 pretty


aggressive
 but
 there
 is
 a
 big
 EOSC
 down


1.6%.
 That's
 another
 one
 of
 those


momentum
 names
 over
 the
 past
 couple


weeks.
 Uh
 but
 but
 but
 but
 energy
 is
 a


big
 sector


and
 as
 a
 result
 of
 it
 being
 a
 big
 sector


you
 know
 the
 market
 continues
 to
 give
 it


some
 level
 of
 premium.


Uh
 Intel
 still
 green
 as
 well.
 Intel


right
 here
 for
 Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 Back


to
 40.
 This
 thing
 was
 stuck
 at
 38
 after


the
 earnings.
 Back
 to
 40.
 Thomas
 says,


"In
 a
 bull
 market,
 I
 don't
 short
 even
 if


I
 think
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 run."
 Yeah.


And
 look,
 buying
 puts
 on
 some
 of these


names
 as
 a
 hedging
 strategy
 is
 fine,
 but


shorting
 is
 you're
 borrowing
 shares
 and


you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 pay
 back
 the


price
 of
 those
 shares
 at
 a
 higher
 price


if
 the
 stock
 goes
 against
 you.
 And


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 you
 there's
 an


infinite
 amount
 of
 money
 you
 could
 lose


in
 that
 situation.


And
 so
 like
 what's
 what's
 you
 know


what's
 the
 reason
 to
 do
 it


if
 you're
 not
 a
 thousand%
 sure
 that


you're
 going
 to
 be
 right


which
 is
 similar
 to
 Qualcomm


as
 who's
 in
 this
 trade
 bro
 the
 chat
 just


put
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you're
 in
 this
 trade


161
 it's
 up
 50%


again
 Mike
 Alfred
 he
 got
 into
 this
 thing


it's
 like
 a
 Bitcoin
 treasury/bitcoin


derivative
 company


I'm
 not
 in
 it
 but
 I
 could
 see
 this
 thing


running.
 I
 really
 could.
 Got
 a
 lot
 of


retail
 that's
 chasing
 the
 next
 thing
 and


this
 one
 might
 be
 the
 next
 thing.


Sports
 says
 I
 bought
 25
 shares.


Next
 says
 I
 got
 100,000
 shares
 at
 121.


Okay.
 Well,
 you're
 up.


You're
 up
 in
 at
 97
 cents.


Plus,
 you
 have
 to
 pay
 to
 borrow
 for
 the


shorts.
 Yeah.
 And
 the
 borrowing
 costs


are
 high,
 especially
 when
 there's


momentum.


Like
 I
 don't know
 the
 borrowing
 costs


for
 for
 D-Wave,
 but
 dude,
 this
 stock
 has


done
 very
 well
 this
 year.
 And
 so
 if
 you


want
 to
 short
 it,
 first
 of
 all,
 you're


shorting
 a
 retail
 army,
 which
 is
 also


never
 a
 good
 thing.
 Second
 of
 all,


whether
 or
 not
 you
 agree
 on
 the


valuation,
 there
 are
 catalysts
 in
 the


quantum
 ecosystem
 that
 can't
 be
 denied.


And
 then
 third
 of
 all,
 it
 just
 had
 a


draw
 down.
 This
 thing
 was
 at
 45,
 fell


all
 the
 way
 to
 26.
 The
 time
 to
 short
 was


when
 it
 was
 at
 45.
 Now
 that
 it's
 back
 to


35,
 I
 mean,
 yeah,
 you
 could
 take
 a
 short


again
 at
 35,
 thinking
 it
 go
 back
 to
 25,


but
 if
 it
 doesn't,
 and
 if
 Allen,
 the


CEO,
 says
 anything
 good
 on
 the
 earnings,


I
 mean,
 it's
 just
 going
 to
 rip
 a
 short


in
 their
 face,
 and
 it's
 just
 not
 the
 the


right
 strategy
 in
 a
 in
 a
 broader
 bull


market.
 Salesforce
 right
 there,
 255,


that's
 getting
 some
 green.
 And
 then


PayPal
 actually
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move


as
 well.


That's
 up
 2%.
 Amit,
 I'm
 starting
 my
 next


hedge
 buying
 UVIX.
 It
 worked
 well
 the


last
 time
 volatility
 spiked.
 I'm
 going


much
 deeper
 this
 time.
 Okay.
 So,
 this
 is


2x
 long
 futures.
 So,
 volatility
 spikes,


then


UIX


should
 go
 up,
 which
 is
 a
 fair
 hedge,
 I


think.
 Okay,
 let's
 ask
 this
 question.


What
 are
 people
 thinking
 of
 as
 a
 hedge


in
 2026?
 Because
 I've
 been
 I'm
 actually


going
 to
 work
 on
 an
 article
 on
 this
 for


Substack.
 Uh
 the
 next
 two
 deep
 dives,
 by


the
 way,
 will
 be
 out
 on
 Friday.
 So,
 I'm


finishing
 up
 one
 of
 them
 will
 be
 Nebius.


And
 so
 I'm
 finishing
 them
 up
 and
 uh


it'll
 be
 out
 on
 Friday.
 But
 what
 if
 you


had
 to
 go
 puts
 on
 a
 name
 or
 on
 or
 calls


on
 a
 name
 or
 an
 inverse
 ETF,
 what
 is


your
 definition
 of,
 you
 know,
 if
 we
 end


out
 7,000
 on
 the
 S&P,
 how
 would
 you


think
 of
 hedging?


If
 you
 were
 going
 to
 hedge
 TLT,


okay,
 I
 don't
 hate
 that
 either.
 I
 mean,


again,
 these
 rates
 are
 probably
 coming


down.
 TLT
 slightly
 down
 on
 the
 day
 as


the
 10
 years
 up.


puts
 on
 Tesla.
 I
 don't
 know if
 I
 would


do
 puts
 on
 Tesla.


I
 feel
 like
 Tesla
 is
 such
 a
 good


company.
 I
 know
 their
 earnings
 aren't


there
 right
 now,
 but
 the
 fundamentals
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 the
 company
 has
 40


billion
 in
 cash.
 Like


I
 feel
 like
 as
 a
 hedging
 strategy,
 you


do
 puts
 on
 something
 a
 bit
 more


speculative.


Then
 again,
 the
 valuation
 is
 up
 there,


so
 I
 get
 it.


Um,
 Oakllo
 puts
 on
 as
 puts
 on
 Palunteer


short
 QQQ.


I
 think
 the
 best
 strategy
 for
 hedging


next
 year
 is
 buying
 a
 bucket
 of
 those


inverse
 ETFs.
 Like
 pick
 whatever
 name


you
 think
 it's
 is
 a
 bit
 aggressively


valued.
 And
 the
 the
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 like


psychology
 here
 needs
 to
 be
 that
 if
 if


it
 is
 speculative
 enough
 to
 run
 without


any
 fundamental
 basis
 and
 when
 I
 mean


fundamental,
 I
 mean
 like
 real


fundamental,
 not
 that
 you
 disagree
 with


the
 multiple,
 but
 that
 like
 it's
 really


there's
 not
 much
 there
 causing
 the


excitement.
 If
 that
 thing
 goes
 up
 more


and
 more
 and
 more
 in
 2026,
 your


portfolio
 should
 be
 in
 a
 phenomenal


position
 if
 you're
 net
 long
 anything,


much
 less
 tech,
 because
 it
 means
 the


market's
 probably
 doing
 very
 well.
 aka


it's
 not
 easy
 for
 Oaklow
 to
 go
 to
 like


$300
 a
 share
 and
 for
 the
 S&P
 to
 be
 flat.


So
 the
 inverse
 of
 that
 means
 that
 the


market's
 definitely
 taken
 a
 downturn
 and


those
 names
 might
 get
 hit
 the
 worst,


right?
 So
 the
 inverse
 ETF
 on
 those
 I


think
 are
 not
 horrible
 hedges.
 Same


thing
 with
 short
 QQQ.
 I
 mean
 look,
 if


you
 think
 tech's
 overvalued
 and
 you
 want


to
 protect
 a
 little
 bit
 to
 the
 downside


if
 we
 have
 some
 bad
 earnings
 going
 into


2026,


then
 just
 kind
 of
 buying
 puts
 on
 the


NASDAQ


is
 not
 horrible
 either.


I'm
 really
 curious
 for
 what
 the
 hell


happens
 to
 crypto
 next
 year
 because
 next


year,
 for
 those
 that
 don't
 know,
 is
 the


the
 last
 year
 of
 the
 four-year
 cycle


where
 we're
 supposed
 to
 get
 a
 crypto


winter,
 2026.
 Last
 time
 was
 in
 22.
 We're


supposed
 to
 see
 it
 in
 26.
 I
 want
 to
 say


it's
 not
 going
 to
 happen
 because
 there's


so
 much
 institutionalization
 but
 then


again
 that
 crypto
 cycle
 has
 been
 very


powerful
 for
 the
 past


uh
 for
 the
 past
 you
 know
 at
 this
 point


what
 14
 years


and
 maybe
 maybe
 that
 does
 end
 up


happening
 to
 some
 extent.


Qualcomm
 are
 we
 still
 moving
 on


Qualcomm?


Yeah,
 still
 moving
 2011.
 Again,
 the


other
 update
 here
 was
 that
 they're
 going


to
 be
 deploying
 AI
 infrastructure
 in


Saudi
 Arabia.
 That
 could
 be
 another


reason
 the
 street's
 excited
 because
 the


Saudis
 have
 a


unlimited
 budget


to
 continue
 spending
 on
 this.


Buying
 puts
 on
 high-flying
 companies
 is


dumb
 because
 you
 were
 paying
 an
 insane


premium
 for
 both
 the
 time
 and
 implied


volatility
 that
 already
 exists.
 Yeah,
 I


agree.
 I
 agree
 on
 that.


I
 think
 the
 inverse
 funds
 might
 be
 a


little
 bit
 better
 of
 an
 option
 or
 you


have
 to
 feel
 very
 confident
 that
 the
 put


premium
 you're
 paying
 relative
 to
 theta


decay
 that
 you
 have
 on
 the
 put
 is
 like


worth
 the
 riskreward
 which
 means
 you


just
 have
 to
 be
 confident
 that
 if
 the


stock
 were
 to
 decline
 it's
 a
 meaningful


way
 to
 protect
 the
 portfolio.
 Also,
 by


the
 way,
 I
 mean,
 if
 you
 are
 super


overweight
 Google,
 for
 example,
 you
 have


thousands
 and
 thousands
 of
 shares
 of


Google,
 it's
 not
 crazy
 to
 just
 protect
 a


little
 bit
 of
 your
 Google
 by
 buying
 some


puts
 on
 your
 Google
 position,
 right?
 So,


like
 if
 you
 have
 a
 massive
 position
 of


something
 that
 you
 want
 to
 protect
 a


little
 bit,


that's
 also
 not
 crazy
 because
 again,
 you


know,
 if
 Google
 were
 to
 go
 down


substantially,
 the
 market's
 probably


going
 down
 and
 you
 know,
 that's
 when


those
 puts
 could
 print
 here.
 By
 the
 way,


speaking
 of
 puts,
 uh,
 hedge
 funds
 have


now
 built
 the
 largest
 short
 oil
 position


in
 history.
 You
 can
 see
 right
 here
 from


Bloomberg,
 bearish
 oil
 wages
 rise
 to
 the


highest
 on
 record.
 Hedge
 funds
 have
 held


a
 record
 short
 bet
 on
 US
 before
 they


sanctioned
 Russia.
 So
 you
 do
 have
 the


hedge
 funds
 that
 are
 not
 the
 most


excited
 about
 oil.
 As
 you
 can
 see
 right


here,
 WTI
 crude
 6165.


That's
 also
 slightly
 green.


Thoughts
 on
 Bergkshire
 lagging
 the


market?
 That's
 an
 interesting
 question.


I've
 thought
 about
 it
 before.
 Uh,
 I'm


not
 sure
 why


Bergkshire
 is
 lagging
 as
 much.
 I
 mean,


the
 the
 sort
 of
 obvious
 reason,
 by
 the


way,
 Qualcomm
 up
 20%,
 ARM
 is
 up
 7%.


based
 on
 Qualcomm.
 The
 obvious
 reason


here
 is
 the
 only
 real
 thing
 that


Bergkshire
 has
 that's
 been
 moving
 this


year
 is
 Apple
 and
 Apple
 is
 only
 up
 10%


year
 to
 date.
 So,
 I
 think
 there
 could
 be


a
 little
 bit
 of
 lack
 of
 confidence
 in


the
 trajectory
 of
 Birkshar
 because


Buffett's
 leaving
 by
 the
 end
 of
 this


year.
 And
 then
 if
 you
 just
 look
 at
 their


assets,
 I
 mean,
 there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of


stuff
 there
 that's
 exciting.


The
 most
 interesting
 thing
 they've
 done


is
 uh
 UNH,


which
 is
 cool,
 but
 I
 mean,
 just
 look
 at


their
 portfolio
 right
 here.
 Coca-Cola,


Bank
 of
 America,
 Chub,
 Craft
 Hind,


Capital
 One,


Liberty
 Media,
 which
 I
 still
 don't
 know


why
 the
 heck
 they
 keep
 buying
 that,
 but


they
 keep
 buying
 SiriusXM,
 Jeff.
 I
 mean,


these
 are
 not
 the
 high
 flyers
 of
 2026.


Not
 even
 close,
 or
 2025.


And
 so,
 part
 of the
 reason
 it
 hasn't
 I


mean,
 remember,
 Apple
 had
 a
 really
 good


2024.
 Apple
 has
 not
 had
 the
 best
 2020.


It
 just
 got
 back
 to
 some
 level
 of
 green.


And
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 Bergkshire
 has


been
 relatively
 flat.


Also,
 you
 know,
 Buffett
 has
 300
 billion


in
 cash.
 So
 he
 is
 probably
 waiting


to
 put
 that
 money
 in
 somewhere.


That's
 what
 you
 have
 on
 Birkshshire
 arm


right
 there.
 That's
 up
 6.3%
 pound.
 Are


we
 still
 holding
 191?
 Wow,
 we
 are
 still


just
 below
 192.


We're
 actually
 holding
 the
 190s,
 folks.


It
 has
 been
 four
 months
 since
 we
 touched


it.
 Today,
 we're
 busting
 through.
 Grab


trying
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 momentum


above
 six.
 We
 got
 earnings
 coming
 up


next
 week
 on
 that.
 SoFi


29.91.
 Uber


up
 1.7%
 as
 well.


Shout
 out
 to
 Mr.
 Chad
 in
 the
 chat.
 Chad,


bro,
 Chad,
 you
 freaking
 you
 got
 uh


this
 this
 was
 this
 was
 Chad
 yesterday.


Well,
 not
 really,
 but
 this
 is
 what
 it


felt
 like.
 This
 is
 what
 it
 felt
 like


when
 Chad
 tweeted
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in


like
 two
 months.


Someone
 was
 like,
 "Where
 is
 Chad?
 He's


been
 gone
 for
 so
 long."
 And
 Chad
 Chad


had
 one
 word,
 bro.
 This
 is
 why
 it
 felt


like
 the
 Michael
 Jordan
 uh
 press


release.
 He
 said,
 "I've
 been
 cooking."


But
 he
 didn't
 have
 to
 say,
 "I've
 been


cooking."
 He
 just
 said,
 "Cooking."


That's
 it.
 That
 was
 enough
 to
 get
 the


Pounder
 community
 to
 be
 like,
 "All


right,
 we
 know
 he's
 okay.


We
 know
 he's
 okay."


What
 happened
 to
 Chad?
 Well,
 there's


your
 response
 right
 there
 on
 the
 screen.


He's
 been
 cooking.


People
 forget
 Chad
 is
 like
 Chad
 is
 an


AIP
 architect.
 Chad
 is
 like
 in
 the
 weeds


of
 like
 building
 Palunteer
 software


every
 single
 day.
 So,
 you
 know,
 he's


taken
 a
 break
 from
 social
 media,
 which
 I


think
 is
 fair
 because
 building
 software


is
 probably
 more
 important.
 Also,
 he's


not
 a
 full-time
 content
 creator,
 right?


You
 know,
 so
 it's
 like
 sometimes


stepping
 away
 is
 is
 also
 relatively


healthy
 just
 for
 the
 mental.
 Nvidia
 back


to
 190.
 But
 he's
 been
 cooking.


Literally,
 when
 I
 saw
 that
 tweet,
 I
 just


thought
 of
 I
 I
 thought
 of
 this
 Michael


Jordan
 press
 release.


Yeah.
 See,
 right
 there.


Want
 me
 to
 tweet
 or
 close
 deals?


Yeah,
 I
 think
 all
 of
 us
 would
 appreciate


the
 closing
 of
 the
 deals.
 You
 got
 to


close
 the
 deal
 so
 then
 I
 can
 tweet
 about


them.
 That's
 how
 this
 works.
 It's
 been
 a


very
 u
 it's
 been
 a
 very
 productive


relationship.
 Chad
 closed
 the
 deals
 and


then
 I
 tweet
 about
 them
 and
 then
 all
 of


us
 kind
 of
 make
 money.
 That's
 that


that's
 how
 it's
 worked
 out
 for
 the
 past


two.
 You
 guys
 know
 Palunteer,
 dude.
 I


saw
 this
 chart
 the
 other
 day.
 Let
 me
 see


if
 I
 can
 um


let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 pull
 it
 up
 again.
 I


might
 not
 have
 saved
 it.
 Palanteer
 has


had
 one
 month
 in
 the
 past
 two
 years
 that


has
 closed
 red.
 I
 can't
 find
 the
 chart.


I'll
 I'll
 bring
 it
 up
 later,
 but
 I
 saw


this
 the
 other
 day.
 Palier
 has
 had
 one


month
 in
 the
 past
 two
 years
 where


they've
 closed
 red.


I
 mean,
 dude,
 that
 is
 just
 like


it's
 like
 what
 a
 story.
 One
 month
 in
 the


past
 two
 and
 a
 half
 years
 that
 they've


closed.
 I
 mean,
 ever
 since
 the
 the
 the


um
 the
 pivot
 to
 profitability
 back
 in


May
 of
 23,
 they've
 had
 one
 month
 where


they've
 actually
 closed
 red.


That's
 not
 easy
 to
 do.
 A
 lot
 of
 stocks


have
 bad
 months,
 multiple
 months
 in
 a


row
 that
 go
 bad.
 Pounders
 had
 one
 month


that
 closed
 red
 and
 that
 was
 your
 dip


and
 then
 boom,
 bounces
 up.


It's
 pretty
 pretty
 incredible.
 But
 as


the
 earnings
 come
 up,
 we
 should


hopefully
 continue
 to
 see
 those
 results.


And
 again,
 Karp
 uh
 Karp
 on
 the
 earnings


or
 not
 on
 the
 earnings,
 but
 on
 the
 Fox


Business
 News
 interview
 said,
 "We're


doing
 very
 well.


and
 he
 said
 it
 looks
 like
 we
 can


continue
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 growth
 not
 only


in
 the
 US
 government
 but
 he
 really


started
 to
 stress
 the
 international
 part


of
 their
 business
 is
 not
 slowing
 down


either.
 Uh
 China
 update
 let's
 go
 here


and
 let's
 see
 what
 we've
 got


with
 China
 and
 the
 US


in
 Tokyo.
 The
 president
 began
 with
 a


handshake
 and
 a
 courtesy
 visit
 with
 the


emperor
 and
 he'll
 later
 have
 a
 meeting


with
 the
 new
 Japanese
 prime
 minister,


Sana
 Takiachi,
 who
 is
 the
 first
 woman
 to


hold
 that
 role.
 On
 Air
 Force
 One,


President
 Trump
 spoke
 extensively
 with


reporters
 traveling
 with
 him.
 But
 he


said
 he
 didn't
 want
 to
 share
 details
 of


what
 officials
 are
 calling
 a
 framework


economic
 agreement
 between
 the
 US
 and


China
 that
 could
 be
 signed
 by
 President


Trump
 and
 Chinese
 President
 Xiinping


later
 this
 week.


I
 don't
 want
 to
 tell
 you
 what
 the


understanding
 is
 because
 what
 we


understood
 yesterday
 or
 two
 days
 ago
 or


even
 today
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be


necessarily
 what
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 in
 two


days.
 I
 mean,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 a


great
 talk.
 Uh
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 respect


for
 President
 Xi.
 I
 like
 him
 a
 lot.
 He


likes
 me
 a
 lot.
 I
 believe
 respects
 me


and
 I
 think
 he
 respects
 our
 country.


And
 speaking
 to
 NBC's
 Kristen
 Welker


yesterday,
 Treasury
 Secretary
 Scott


Bessant
 sounded
 an
 optimistic
 note
 on


those
 China
 negotiations,
 arguing
 that


the
 president's
 tariff
 threat
 has
 helped


to
 push
 to
 a
 deal.


President
 Trump
 gave
 me
 a
 great
 deal
 of


negotiating
 leverage
 with
 the
 threat
 of


the
 100%
 tariffs
 on
 November
 1st.
 And
 I


believe
 we've
 reached
 a
 very
 substantial


framework
 that
 will
 avoid
 that
 and
 allow


us
 to
 discuss
 many
 other
 things
 with
 the


Chinese.


And
 guys,
 one
 interesting
 item
 from


Bessant's
 interview.
 He
 told
 Welker
 that


he
 shares
 the
 pain
 of
 American
 soybean


farmers
 who
 are
 suffering
 from
 a
 Chinese


soybean
 boycott
 because
 he's
 a
 soybean


farmer
 himself.
 Remember,
 Besson
 owns


between
 5
 and
 $25
 million
 worth
 of


farmland
 in
 North
 Dakota
 and
 he
 rents


out
 that
 land
 for
 soybean
 farming.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 you
 can
 make
 a
 more


tonedeaf
 comment
 than
 saying
 you
 are
 a


soybean
 farmer
 and
 you
 relate
 to
 the


challenges
 of
 soybean
 farmers
 because


you
 own
 and
 rent
 out
 farmland.


Like
 I
 love
 bent.
 I
 love
 me
 some


descent.
 But
 when
 when
 he
 said
 that
 over


the
 weekend,
 I
 was
 like,
 well,
 it's
 a


little
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


really
 capturing
 the
 heart
 of
 the


problem
 that
 that
 the
 farmers
 are
 going


through.
 He
 did
 tease
 ahead
 to
 this


trade
 announcement
 with
 China,
 saying


that
 soybean
 farmers
 in
 particular
 are


going
 to
 feel
 very
 good,
 he
 said,
 about


what's
 going
 on
 for
 this
 season
 and
 for


seasons
 to
 come
 when
 that
 deal
 is


announced.
 Guys,
 back
 over
 to
 you.


>> Uh
 yeah,
 Aean,
 New
 York,


>> if
 Bant
 is
 a
 soybean
 farmer
 farmer,
 then


I'm
 a
 farmer
 as
 well
 cuz
 I'm
 farming


aura
 every
 day.
 So
 if
 if
 he's
 a
 soybean


farmer,
 then
 I'm
 a
 farmer
 for
 all
 the


aura
 farming
 that
 I
 do
 every
 day.
 New


York
 Times
 this
 morning,
 page
 one,
 as
 a


big
 story
 about
 the
 farm
 economy
 in
 Iowa


and
 how
 they've
 been
 under
 pressure


because
 of
 some
 of
 the
 policy
 direction.


I
 guess
 my
 question
 to
 you
 is,
 do
 you


think
 we're
 in
 a
 realm
 now
 where
 we
 are


going
 to
 ramp
 up
 rare
 earths
 as
 fast
 as


we
 can
 and
 rely
 on
 China
 to
 help
 us
 at


least
 build
 a
 bridge
 between
 now
 and
 the


time
 when
 that
 mining
 is
 productive?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 exactly
 it,
 Carl.


The
 the
 agenda
 here
 seems
 to
 be
 two


things
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 One
 is
 to
 try


to
 get
 the
 Chinese
 to
 roll
 back
 these


proposed
 export
 controls
 on
 rare
 earth


so
 that
 we
 can
 secure
 a
 supply
 from


China
 in
 the
 short
 term
 and
 then
 the


other
 is
 to
 figure
 out
 all
 the
 other


places
 where
 we
 can
 get
 these
 rare


earths
 and
 get
 rare
 earth
 processing
 uh


up
 to
 speed
 as
 quickly
 as
 possible
 so


that
 we're
 not
 dependent
 on
 China
 over


the
 long
 run.
 So
 if
 you're
 Beijing


looking
 at
 that
 two-prong
 strategy,
 you


might
 say,
 "Hey,
 wait
 a
 second.
 you


know,
 do
 we
 want
 to
 allow
 the
 US
 to
 sort


of
 get
 off
 of
 our
 our
 supply
 uh
 and
 be


able
 to
 leverage
 themselves
 into
 a
 world


where
 they
 don't
 need
 us
 anymore?
 So,
 I


would
 say
 that
 would
 be
 the
 worry
 from


the
 Beijing
 perspective.
 Why
 not
 use


that
 leverage
 while
 they
 have
 it?


>> Yeah,
 it
 really
 feels
 like
 uh
 five


meetings
 since
 liberation
 day
 shows
 that


decoupling
 uh
 is
 is
 not
 necessarily
 on


the
 table
 in
 the
 immediate
 term.
 Aean,


thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Aman
 Jabers,
 the


major
 averages
 back
 at
 record
 highs
 and


adding
 to
 gains
 this
 morning.
 Let's


bring
 in
 Steve
 Sausnik,
 chief
 strategist


at
 Interactive
 Brokers.


>> All
 right,
 so
 looks
 like
 that
 Trump
 uh


China
 framework
 again
 that
 you
 that
 that


word
 framework
 has
 been
 used
 so
 many


times
 in
 these
 discussions,
 but
 uh


that's
 what
 continues
 to
 be
 the
 the
 core


argument
 that
 the
 scent
 is
 giving
 the


media
 around
 how
 this
 negotiation
 will


play
 out
 that
 there
 is
 a
 framework
 in


place


for
 it
 to
 potentially
 lead
 to
 a
 deal.
 Uh


meme
 stock
 ETF
 down
 2.8%.


Oaklow
 continues
 to
 get
 hit
 right
 here


down
 now
 2%
 on
 the
 day.
 Same
 thing
 with


Big
 Bear
 AI
 that's
 down
 about
 half
 a


percent.
 Whereas
 Beyond
 Meat,
 it
 did
 go


green.
 Beyond
 Meat
 is
 now
 back
 down
 6%.


So
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 names
 not
 really
 able


to
 hold
 up
 their
 end
 of
 the
 bargain
 as


the
 broader
 market
 goes
 green.
 Pouncer


still
 191,
 Hoodie
 147.


Uh,
 and
 they're
 they're
 kind
 of
 playing


in
 the
 same
 realm
 as
 gold.
 Gold
 is
 still


down
 almost
 3%
 on
 the
 day.


Again,
 it's
 not
 too
 crazy.
 It's
 not
 too


crazy.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 us


expected
 that
 some
 of
 the
 more


aggressive
 names
 might
 continue
 to
 take


a
 breather,
 but
 the
 broader
 market


catalysts
 for
 the
 Googles,
 Amazons
 of


the
 world,
 those
 aren't
 easily
 slowing


down.
 Amazon
 right
 here
 227


as
 well.
 ASST,
 that
 one's
 still
 up
 35%.


That
 one's
 green.
 We
 haven't
 really
 seen


a
 lot
 of
 selling
 on
 that
 yet.
 Again,


this
 thing
 was
 $11
 back
 on
 September


17th.


I
 do
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 need
 a
 decent


amount
 of
 a
 retail
 army
 to
 come
 in.
 You


know,
 say
 say
 what
 you
 want
 about
 Eric


Jackson.
 Like
 him
 or
 or
 hate
 him.
 I


mean,
 he
 was
 able
 to
 cultivate
 retail
 to


believe
 in
 Open
 Door,
 which
 is
 why


Openoro
 is
 has
 held
 the
 8x
 that
 they've


been
 able
 to
 hold
 from
 from
 50
 Cents.


Um,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that
 that
 same
 type


of
 momentum
 exists
 in
 ASST.
 I
 mean,


look,
 when
 these
 names
 run
 for
 no


fundamental
 reason,
 just
 because
 someone


tweeted
 about
 them,
 they're
 only
 as
 good


as
 the
 ring
 leader
 that's
 compelling


people
 to
 get
 excited
 about
 them,
 unless


the
 company
 actually,
 you
 know,
 shows


like
 a
 fundamental
 pivot,
 which
 maybe


Strive
 will
 do.


But
 uh
 you
 got
 to
 ask
 yourself,
 you


know,
 do
 do
 these
 names
 have
 an
 Eric


Jackson
 that
 is
 enough
 to
 cultivate


enough
 people
 to
 believe
 in
 it
 to
 the


point
 where
 it's
 very
 hard
 for
 it
 to


reach
 the
 levels
 it
 was
 at
 before


because
 just
 so
 many
 people
 are
 bought


into
 the
 story.
 And
 then
 if
 the
 company


does
 anything
 good,
 you're
 talking
 about


increased
 multiple
 expansion.
 By
 the


way,
 Qualcomm
 still
 moving
 17%.


On
 the
 day,


yeah,
 you've
 been
 slacking
 on
 pump
 and


grab.
 Well,
 see,
 that's
 the
 difference


between
 me
 and
 some
 of
 these
 other
 guys.


I
 mean,
 I
 I
 don't
 really
 want
 to
 stand


in
 front
 of
 a
 celebrity's
 house
 and


convince
 them
 to
 buy
 a
 share
 of
 a


company.
 I
 want
 the
 company's
 execution


to
 be
 enough
 for
 the
 name
 to
 move.
 Like,


look,
 as
 as
 much
 as
 I've
 covered
 Hood


and
 Pounder,
 I
 do
 not
 think
 I'm
 the


reason
 for
 those
 stocks
 having
 the
 gains


that
 they've
 had
 over
 the
 past
 couple


years.
 I
 might
 be
 the
 reason
 for
 other


people
 in
 the
 world
 knowing
 about
 them,


but
 I
 am
 not
 the
 reason
 for
 these
 stocks


moving
 to
 multiundred
 billion
 dollar


value.
 There's
 just
 not
 enough
 influence


or
 money
 from
 one
 person
 to
 make
 them


happen.
 Now,
 if
 this
 was
 like
 a
 penny


stock,
 it
 was
 $200
 million
 and
 it
 goes


to
 like
 $800
 million.
 Like,
 yeah,
 I


could
 see
 that
 happening.
 These
 are


massive,
 massive
 companies.
 Same
 thing


with
 Grab.
 $25
 billion
 company.
 You


know,
 I
 think
 it
 could
 be
 a
 $100
 million


company
 one
 day.
 That's
 not
 going to
 be


because
 of
 me.
 That's
 going
 to
 be


because
 of
 execution
 on
 the
 part
 of
 the


company.
 SoFi
 right
 there,
 2978,
 still


holding
 2.4%
 and
 then
 Nvidia
 recovering


back


back
 to
 the
 190s
 right
 here.


Mike
 Michael
 Sailor


bought
 more
 micro
 strategy
 say
 that
 is


correct
 or
 he
 bought
 more
 Bitcoin
 that's


why
 Micro
 Strategy
 is
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


Bitcoin
 still
 struggling.
 Dolingo
 goes


red.
 Duolingo
 not
 one
 of
 those
 momentum


names
 that
 we
 talked
 about
 last
 week
 but


Dualingo
 just
 having
 a
 crappy
 narrative


which
 is
 what
 I
 wrote
 in
 my
 Substack.


That's
 why
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 own
 it.
 I


just
 feel
 like
 that
 narrative
 is
 a


little
 too
 aggressive
 on
 AI
 killing


their
 moat
 and
 that's
 why
 that
 one's


been
 stuck.
 Bitcoin
 just
 below
 115.


Just
 below
 115.
 Argentina
 is
 up
 today.


Again,
 we
 did
 have
 uh
 a
 big
 move
 by
 MLE


being
 elected.
 And
 so
 R
 ARGT,
 the


Argentina
 ETF,


that
 one
 also
 making
 a
 move.
 Wow.
 The
 US


now
 has
 5,426


data
 centers.


Goodness
 gracious,
 dude.
 More
 than
 any


other
 country
 in
 the
 world.
 5,426


data
 centers.


Look,
 the
 news
 last
 week
 was
 that
 Oracle


took
 on
 $40
 billion
 of
 debt
 to
 build


more
 data
 centers,
 which
 is
 super


bullish
 for
 Navius,
 Core
 Wee,
 Iran,
 etc.


Um,
 if
 that's
 not
 stopping,
 I
 mean,


again,
 this
 tech
 sector
 buildout,


it
 does
 look
 like
 it
 is
 on
 its
 way
 to


creating
 even
 more
 momentum
 in
 the


broader
 AI
 names.
 Argentina
 right
 there


up
 19%
 on
 the
 day.
 A
 RGT


Draen
 Miller
 was
 long
 this
 ETF
 for
 a


while.
 I
 think
 he
 sold
 a
 bit
 ago,
 but
 he


bought
 before
 Malay
 got
 elected
 because


I
 think
 he
 felt
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of


regime
 change
 that
 could
 that
 could
 take


place
 around
 their
 their
 system
 of
 of


capitalism.


And
 this
 one's
 still
 up
 20%
 on
 the
 day.


Uh
 let's
 see
 what
 else
 we
 got.


Let's
 see
 what
 else
 we
 have
 right
 here.


U
 was
 down
 21%.
 What
 is
 this
 stock


again?
 This
 is


not
 sure
 what
 this
 one
 is.
 Oh,
 yeah.


This
 was
 a
 uh
 this
 is
 a
 uh
 commodities


minor,
 right?
 Silver,
 Bitcoin,
 and
 gold


or
 not
 Bitcoin,
 silver,
 gold,
 and


copper.
 Wow.
 Down
 20%.
 All right.
 So,


the
 gold
 draw
 down


hurting
 the
 miners


as
 well.


Um,


okay.
 Let's
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.
 A


couple
 of
 other


core
 headlines
 to
 look
 at.
 This
 is
 the


AI
 chart
 that
 we're
 talking
 about
 on


data
 centers.
 So,
 US
 has
 5,426.
 There's


40
 billion
 worth
 of
 data
 centers
 under


construction.
 That's
 up
 4x
 from
 2022.


Germany
 has
 529,
 United
 Kingdom
 has
 523,


China
 is
 449,
 Canada
 337,
 Japan
 is
 200,


the
 United
 States
 5,426.


There
 was
 a
 good
 article
 this
 morning


that
 well
 I
 didn't
 fully
 finish
 reading


it
 today
 but
 it
 said
 um
 electricity


costs
 have
 not
 gone
 up
 simply
 because
 of


data
 centers
 and
 it
 goes
 into
 a
 bigger


deep
 dive
 on
 what's
 going
 on
 with


electricity
 in
 the
 country.
 Now
 granted


I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 can
 say
 it's
 other


things
 entirely
 outside
 of
 data
 centers.


I
 do
 think
 data
 centers
 are
 definitely


playing
 a
 role
 with
 electricity
 costs,


but
 the
 big
 tech
 companies
 are
 going
 to


have
 to
 push
 back
 on
 that
 narrative
 and


try
 to
 show
 people
 that
 it's
 not
 just


data
 centers
 because
 they're
 going
 to


get
 a
 lot
 of
 push
 back
 if
 data
 centers


continue
 to
 be
 the
 resounding
 reason
 for


why
 electricity
 prices
 are
 doubling.
 Uh


here
 is
 the
 IBKR
 analyst.
 Let's
 take
 a


listen
 to
 him
 real
 quick
 and
 see
 what
 he


thinks
 is
 going
 on
 as
 we
 get
 into


earnings
 this
 week.


>> Uh
 Steve,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 So,


we
 got
 trade
 talks
 this
 week.
 We've
 got


a
 Fed
 meeting
 and
 we
 have
 mag
 five


earnings
 uh
 with
 the
 exception
 obviously


of
 Nvidia
 and
 Tesla.
 Uh
 how
 do
 you
 think


it
 all
 shakes
 out
 on
 this
 very
 busy


week?


>> Well,
 good
 morning
 Leslie.
 I
 think
 I


think
 what
 it's
 shaking
 out
 is
 it's


telling
 us
 that
 that
 the
 positive
 vibes,


the
 momentum
 is
 really
 what's
 ruling


right
 now.
 I
 mean,
 one
 of
 the
 shest
 ways


that
 the
 to
 get
 this
 market
 to
 rally
 is


is
 imply
 that
 there's
 something
 good


going
 on
 in
 trade.
 We
 saw
 it
 in
 the


first
 Trump
 administration
 when
 sort
 of


seemingly
 every
 morning
 I'd
 wake
 up
 and


the
 mark
 the
 futures
 would
 be
 a
 little


higher
 and
 the
 rumor
 would
 be
 that
 some


trade
 talks
 were
 going
 well
 even
 if


there
 was
 no
 apparent
 trade
 talks


actually
 occurring.
 So
 in
 this
 case


we're
 actually
 doing
 it
 and
 and
 you
 can


see
 the
 market's
 positive
 response


because
 um
 the
 the
 China
 the
 Asian
 trade


talks
 seemed
 to
 be
 going
 well
 but


meanwhile
 there
 was
 very
 quietly
 a
 10%


tariff
 on
 Canada
 which
 is
 basically
 lost


in
 the
 news
 flow.
 So
 it
 tells
 you
 the


way
 the
 market
 is
 geared
 toward


interpreting
 any
 trade
 news
 as
 good


news.
 Yeah.
 Uh,
 Goldman
 had
 a
 piece
 out


I
 I
 believe
 over
 the
 weekend
 focusing
 on


the
 underperformance
 of
 the
 quality


factor.
 Uh,
 it
 says
 that's
 in
 part
 due


to
 a
 short
 squeeze,
 noting
 a
 basket
 of


most
 shorted
 stocks
 has
 doubled
 since


the
 market
 low
 in
 April
 and
 has
 rallied


more
 than
 30%
 since
 September.
 Would
 now


be
 a
 good
 time,
 you
 think,
 to
 get
 back


into
 quality
 given
 just
 all
 the


uncertainty
 that's
 out
 there?


>> Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 we've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of


action
 in
 what
 I
 would
 call
 thematic


stocks.
 I
 won't
 I
 I
 won't,
 you
 know,
 put


them
 in
 so
 diplomatic.


>> That's
 fair.
 Yes,
 but
 number
 two
 most


active
 stock
 at
 our
 platform
 last
 week


was
 Beyond
 uh
 was
 Beyond
 Meat.
 And


number
 five
 and
 six
 were
 Regetti
 and


Oaklo.
 So
 it
 tells
 you
 that
 there's
 a
 a


thematic
 play
 in
 in
 question
 here.
 But


you
 know,


>> wow.
 Regetti,
 Oaklo,
 and
 Beyond
 Meat,


top
 three
 traded
 stocks
 on
 IBKR
 last


week.


I
 mean,
 it
 goes
 to
 show
 that
 there
 is
 a


lot
 of
 momentum
 in
 those
 names.
 By
 the


way,
 Energy
 Fuels
 also
 getting
 hit


today.
 So
 some
 of
 the
 nuclear
 stocks


outside
 of
 Oaklo
 still
 getting
 some
 red.


Wow.
 14%
 down
 on
 UU.


If
 you
 look
 at
 some
 of
 the
 data
 center


names
 that
 I
 have
 on
 the
 left
 side
 of
 my


screen,
 CEG
 down
 1%,
 Cipher
 just
 went


red,
 VST
 just
 down
 1.4,
 Bit
 Farms,
 this


was
 at
 480
 in
 the
 morning
 down
 3%.


Oracle's
 down
 a
 bit,
 Oaklo
 still
 down


2.8%.
 so
 far
 and
 we
 only
 have
 an
 hour


worth
 of
 data,
 but
 last
 week
 the
 theme


of
 what
 we
 all
 pretty
 much
 observed
 was


that
 we
 were
 seeing
 a
 momentum
 draw


down.
 It
 was
 hurting
 Hood.
 It
 was


hurting
 Nebius,
 but
 it
 was
 really


hurting
 the
 other
 names
 that
 you
 know


don't
 really
 have
 revenue.
 On
 a
 day
 like


today,
 Nebius
 is
 back
 up.
 Hood
 is
 back


up.
 They're
 not
 at
 all-time
 highs,
 but


they've
 recovered
 a
 decent
 chunk.
 Nebus


was
 at
 94.
 Hood
 was
 at
 120.
 Oaklo
 has


not
 really
 recovered
 that
 much
 as
 it


continues
 to
 go
 down.
 It's
 up
 from
 the


absolute
 lows,
 but
 it's,
 you
 know,
 still


down
 on
 the
 day.
 So,
 I
 guess
 the
 the


theme
 of
 this
 week
 should
 be
 even
 with


rate
 cuts,
 even
 with
 good
 earnings,
 even


with
 a
 Trump
 China
 deal,
 do
 those


momentum
 names
 have
 enough
 retail


excitement
 to
 continue
 the
 move
 they've


made
 that
 have
 allowed
 them
 to
 go
 up


four
 to
 5x
 this
 year?


And
 can
 and
 more
 importantly,
 can
 the


broader
 market
 continue
 to
 move
 higher,


the
 S&P
 without
 those
 names?


Because
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 everyone's


screaming
 it
 is
 a
 bubble.
 I
 mean,


remember
 three
 weeks
 ago,
 I
 think
 the


core
 argument
 that
 that
 even
 Steve
 made


was
 that
 it
 can't
 be
 a
 bubble
 if
 Oak


goes
 to
 zero.
 And
 Oaklo
 is
 probably
 not


going
 to
 zero.
 But
 even
 if
 it
 did,
 that


that's
 not
 indicative
 of
 now,
 if
 Nvidia


were
 to
 take
 a
 30%
 job,
 that's
 bubble


because,
 you
 know,
 you
 can't
 have


Nvidia,
 you
 can't
 have
 the
 8%
 of
 the
 S&P


getting
 that
 big
 of
 a
 hit.
 But
 if
 the


markets
 can
 keep
 going
 and
 some
 of
 those


other
 names
 can't
 really
 keep
 up
 with


it,
 it
 might
 not
 be
 indicative
 of
 a


bubble.
 It
 just
 might
 mean
 some
 of
 those


names,
 you
 know,
 don't
 have
 the
 retail


excitement
 to
 to
 keep
 their
 momentum


alive.


>> Actually,
 what's
 what's
 encouraging
 to


me
 is
 the
 reaction
 that's
 that
 so-called


quality
 stocks
 or
 old
 economy
 stocks
 had


on
 earnings
 news.
 Coke
 Coke
 reacted


well.
 We
 saw
 Dr.
 Pepper
 reacting
 well


today.
 Um,
 so
 this
 is
 telling
 us
 that


that
 there
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 latent


demand
 for
 these
 things.
 I
 I
 I
 hate
 to


say
 it
 because
 I
 sound
 like
 a
 stop
 clock


a
 lot
 of
 times
 by
 saying,
 you
 know,
 you


never
 go
 wrong
 with
 high
 quality
 stocks


that
 pay
 a
 good
 dividend.
 Um
 and
 you


know
 and
 sometimes
 lowvall
 is
 actually


the
 way
 to
 to
 go
 when
 you're
 when
 you're


in
 sort
 of
 a
 momentum
 driven
 environment


sort
 of
 to
 zigg
 when
 the
 others
 are


zagging.
 But
 um
 you
 know
 right
 now
 you


could
 more
 or
 less
 throw
 a
 dart
 board


and
 and
 things.


>> But
 to
 Leslie's
 point
 about
 the
 Goldman


note,
 they
 argue
 that
 actually
 moving


back
 to
 quality
 might
 not
 make
 sense


because
 short
 interest
 is
 so
 high
 and


they're
 counting
 on
 those
 guys
 to
 cover


eventually.


>> Well,
 this
 is
 really
 the
 question.
 I


mean,
 for
 if
 you're
 shorter
 term
 focus,


I
 mean,
 honestly,
 momentum
 momentum
 is


the
 factor
 that
 rules
 and
 and
 that's


really
 what's
 going
 on.
 If
 you're
 longer


term
 focus,
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 you
 may


want
 to
 consider
 whether
 we're
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 of
 nosebleleed
 at
 some
 of


these
 levels
 and
 and
 move
 into
 things


that
 have
 uh,
 you
 know,
 that
 have
 not


been
 priced
 as
 aggressively.


>> Yeah,
 obviously
 it's
 a
 big
 uh
 week
 for


earnings.
 We've
 seen
 a
 third
 of
 the
 S&P


500
 already
 report.
 Uh,
 the
 vast


majority,
 I
 believe,
 believe
 about
 87%


have
 beat
 on
 the
 bottom.
 Although
 the


bottom
 line,
 although
 estimates
 have


come
 down
 ever
 since
 that
 April
 time


period,
 how
 would
 you
 characterize
 what


we've
 seen
 from
 earnings
 so
 far
 and
 and


what
 does
 that
 bode
 for
 the
 remainder
 of


the
 season?


>> I
 think
 the
 what's
 interesting
 to
 me


this
 earning
 season
 is
 how
 well
 the
 that


the
 stocks
 are
 doing
 when
 they're
 doing


well.
 I
 I
 know
 that's
 sort
 of
 circular,


but
 but
 the
 they're
 being
 rewarded
 for


good
 news,
 whereas
 typically
 in
 most


earning
 season
 you'd
 get,
 you
 know,


you'd
 get
 clobbered
 if
 you
 missed
 and


you'd
 get
 a
 nice,
 you
 know,
 bump
 if
 you


if
 you
 gained.
 In
 this
 case,
 it's


actually
 almost
 two-sided
 or
 or
 maybe
 in


some
 cases,
 the
 market's
 willing
 to


overlook
 some
 stuff.
 Let's
 say
 in
 the


case
 of
 Tesla
 where
 where
 the
 numbers


missed
 and
 the
 stock
 ended
 up
 higher
 on


the
 day
 anyway.
 So,
 we
 are
 starting
 to


see
 a
 more
 charitable
 approach,
 shall
 we


say.
 What's
 interesting
 to
 me
 is
 I'm


looking
 at
 a
 there's
 a
 number
 that
 I


watch
 sometimes
 called
 VIX
 9D,
 which
 is


the
 VIX
 except
 instead
 of
 looking
 at
 30


days,
 it
 looks
 at
 9
 days.
 you've
 laid


out
 a
 case
 for
 why
 these
 nine
 days
 could


be
 exceptionally
 volatile
 and
 yet
 that


number
 was
 I
 think
 below
 14
 which


implies
 pretty
 pretty
 much
 nobody's


really
 looking
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 fireworks


either
 from
 the
 think
 about
 Wednesday


you
 have
 the
 Fed
 you
 have
 Microsoft
 you


have
 Meta
 you
 have
 Google
 now
 in
 theory


they
 could
 all
 sort
 of
 balance
 each


other
 out
 potentially
 but
 in
 reality


there there's
 a
 lot
 of
 potential


volatility
 that
 could
 come
 and
 we're


actually
 getting
 it
 a
 day
 like
 today


where
 where
 we're
 up
 almost
 1%
 that's


volatility
 volatility
 calcul
 regulations


are
 meant
 to
 be
 agnostic.
 They
 don't


care
 if
 you're
 going
 up
 or
 down.


Volatility
 for
 people.
 What
 we're
 seeing


today
 is
 socially
 acceptable
 volatility.


What
 we
 what
 what
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 see


is
 a
 move
 of
 this
 magnitude
 on
 the


downside.
 That's
 when
 I
 get
 phone
 calls.


What's
 went
 what
 what
 went
 wrong.


>> Yeah.
 And
 we're
 also
 uh
 ending
 out
 the


seasonally
 spooky
 month
 of
 October
 this


week,
 which
 could
 bode
 well,
 of
 course,


for
 stocks.


>> Obviously,
 November
 is
 a
 lot
 better.
 And


look,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 that
 are


still
 getting
 hit
 in
 the
 draw
 down.
 I


mean,
 maybe
 November
 is
 what's
 going
 to


clear
 up
 some
 of
 their
 weakness.
 Uh


maybe
 a
 good
 earnings
 as
 well.
 You
 know,


a
 lot
 of
 those
 names,
 they
 they
 they


kind
 of
 change
 the
 narrative.
 Show
 the


growth,
 which
 is
 ultimately
 what
 you


need
 as
 any
 growth
 stock
 that
 gets
 a


multiple.
 You've
 got
 to
 show
 the
 growth.


Growth
 solves
 everything.
 I
 mean,
 look


at
 Pounder
 Hood.
 Growth
 has
 solved


everything.
 Same
 thing
 with
 Nebus.
 They


got
 that
 Microsoft
 contract
 quintupling


the
 revenues.
 Growth
 solves
 everything.


You
 put
 up
 the
 growth.
 I
 mean,
 there's


not
 that
 many
 names
 publicly
 that


actually
 can
 compound
 and
 grow.
 It's


very
 hard
 to
 find
 companies
 consistently


that
 put
 up
 the
 growth.
 That's
 why
 SoFi


went
 from
 seven
 to
 30.
 I
 mean,
 it


becomes
 undeniable
 at
 some
 point
 if


they're
 growing
 upwards
 of
 30
 40%.
 If
 a


lot
 of
 these
 names
 can
 keep
 up
 the


growth,
 you
 might
 see
 some
 more


momentum.
 If
 they
 don't
 keep
 up
 the


growth,
 you
 know,
 then
 it's
 just
 a


question
 of
 where
 those
 stocks
 can
 go.


Right
 there
 at
 218,
 grab
 at
 604
 and


Amazon
 still
 holding
 227.


It
 was
 at
 228.
 Assist,
 how's
 that
 one


doing?


155.
 still
 up
 40%.
 Uh
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the


Tesla
 board
 chairs,
 Robin.
 Here's
 what


she
 had
 to
 say
 for
 all
 the
 people


thinking
 of
 how
 to
 vote
 for
 their
 Tesla


stock


>> but
 also
 in
 terms
 of
 Optimus
 and
 and
 the


robots
 as
 you
 can
 see
 here
 in
 New
 York


today.
 And
 so
 for
 us
 it's
 uh
 we
 sat
 back


as
 a
 board
 and
 actually
 determined
 that


this
 is
 the
 right
 time
 to
 lean
 into
 um


that
 transformation
 and
 for
 Elon
 to
 lead


that
 transformation.
 And
 uh
 we
 then


formed
 a
 special
 committee
 to
 actually


determine
 what
 the
 right
 incentive


program
 was
 to
 have
 him
 motivated
 to


deliver
 unprecedented
 uh
 value
 for


shareholders
 over
 this
 next
 uh
 decade.


And
 so
 what
 do
 you
 tell
 shareholders
 who


say
 this
 just
 seems
 like
 too
 much
 money.


He's
 already
 incentivized.
 He's
 he
 owns


a
 big
 chunk
 of
 the
 company
 already.
 I


mean
 that's
 that
 would
 be
 the
 push
 back,


right?


>> Well,
 it's
 a
 performance
 plan.
 If
 he


doesn't
 perform
 against
 the
 milestones


both
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 market
 cap
 and
 the


operational
 milestones,
 he
 actually
 gets


nothing.
 He
 doesn't
 get
 any
 salary
 or


any
 equity
 unless
 he
 actually
 performs


and
 achieves
 the
 milestones
 that
 are
 in


the
 plan.
 that
 is
 uh
 the
 basis
 of
 this


uh
 performance
 plan.


>> Um
 look,
 you
 know,
 I've
 argued
 this
 is


this
 is
 the
 greatest
 uh
 pay
 for


performance
 plan
 that
 exists
 as
 was
 uh


the
 previous
 one
 which
 was
 struck
 down.


I
 I
 want
 you
 to
 listen
 to
 this.
 This
 was


Elon
 Musk
 addressing
 the
 upcoming
 vote


uh
 during
 a
 call
 uh
 last
 week
 on
 the


quarterly
 results
 call
 where
 he
 he


discusses
 some
 of
 this.


that
 I
 just
 don't
 feel
 comfortable


building
 a
 robot
 army
 here
 and
 not
 and


then
 uh


you
 know
 being
 ousted
 because
 of
 some


asine
 uh
 recommendations
 from
 ISS
 and


Glass
 Lewis
 who
 have
 no
 freaking
 clue.
 I


mean
 those
 guys
 are
 corporate
 terrorists


and
 and
 the
 problem
 Yeah.
 So
 let
 me
 like


explain
 like
 the
 core
 problem
 here
 is


that
 uh
 so
 many
 of
 the
 index
 funds
 um


the
 passive
 funds
 vote
 along
 the
 lines


of
 what
 whatever
 glass
 lewis
 and
 ISS


recommend.


Now
 they've
 made
 many
 terrible


recommendations.


>> So
 Robin,
 how
 much
 of
 this
 is
 about


>> Okay,
 we'll
 go
 back
 to
 that.
 But
 folks,


we
 got
 some
 AMD
 news.


We
 got
 some
 AMD
 news.


Um,


oh
 my.
 Okay,
 it
 looks
 like
 AMD


just
 got
 a
 partnership
 with
 the


Department
 of
 Energy.
 Is
 that
 correct?


Department
 of
 Energy
 forms
 $1
 billion


partnership
 with
 AMD
 to
 build
 two


supercomputers.


Bro,
 the
 news
 today,
 whether
 it's


Qualcomm
 or
 AMD,


you're
 just
 getting
 a
 ton
 of
 things


going
 back
 and
 forth.
 There
 you
 go.
 AMD


was
 red
 for
 the
 day
 until
 this
 piece
 of


news
 came
 out.
 Now
 you
 got
 a
 move.
 Not
 a


big
 move,
 but
 a
 1%
 candle.


Department
 of
 Energy
 $1
 billion


contract.
 Um,


look,
 a
 billion
 is
 not
 like
 crazy
 money,


but
 the
 fact
 that
 they're
 establishing
 a


contract,
 which
 likely
 will
 set
 them
 up


to
 get
 many
 more
 billions,
 is
 I
 think


kind
 of
 the
 the
 key
 takeaway.
 Two


supercomputers
 the
 DOE
 wants
 from
 AMD.


Okay,
 there
 you
 go.
 That's
 a
 Reuters


report
 citing
 energy
 secretary,
 right?


And
 you're
 seeing
 a
 bit
 of
 move
 right


there.
 Yeah.
 Now,
 Qualcomm
 just
 has
 to


announce
 an
 OpenAI
 deal
 and
 say,
 "Well,


we've
 decided
 to
 give
 up
 20%
 of
 our


company,
 not
 10%
 like
 AMD
 for
 OpenAI
 to


buy
 our
 shares."
 Qualcomm
 is
 down
 from


205
 back
 to
 192.
 So,
 you
 did
 have
 some


buyers
 at
 205
 that
 are
 bag
 holding
 a


little
 bit
 of
 those
 shares.
 Maybe
 that


one
 recovers
 on
 earnings,
 but
 192
 still


up
 23
 bucks
 on
 the
 day,
 even
 if
 it's
 not


at
 high
 of
 these.


Okay,
 AMD
 and
 Qualcomm
 both
 making
 their


move.
 You
 do
 have
 the
 Mexico
 president


also
 saying
 something.
 Um,


right
 here,
 Shine
 Bomb
 says,
 "We'll
 give


it
 a
 few
 more
 weeks
 to
 close
 issue
 of
 54


pending
 trade
 barriers."
 Maybe
 that


coincides
 with
 a
 China
 and
 India
 deal
 as


well
 from
 Mexico.
 And
 so
 maybe
 you
 get
 a


lot
 of
 those
 deals
 closing
 at
 the
 same


time.
 But
 the
 Mexican
 president
 has
 had


a
 really
 positive
 relationship
 with


Trump
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 months.
 And


hopefully
 that
 can
 continue.
 Nvidia


right
 there.
 190
 also
 getting
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 boost


based
 on
 uh
 that
 AMD
 deal.
 Okay,
 back
 to


back
 to
 Tessy


>> incentivizing


uh
 Elon
 because
 it
 sounds
 like
 to
 me


more
 than
 anything
 he
 he
 believes
 that


he
 actually
 worries
 about
 AI
 in
 the


future
 and
 and
 wants
 to
 have
 greater


control
 of
 the
 company
 and
 how
 I'm


curious
 the
 board
 thinks
 about
 that.


Yes,
 he's
 been
 very
 consistent
 in
 that


view
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 having
 enough


influence
 over
 the
 vote
 uh
 of
 of
 um


Tesla
 uh
 in
 the
 future
 so
 that
 uh
 bad


things
 can't
 happen
 with
 the
 AI.
 So
 it's


less
 about
 compensation
 and
 more
 about


the
 voting
 influence
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 this


and
 that
 was
 very
 clear
 uh
 as
 we
 were


negotiating
 from
 a
 special
 committee


perspective
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 this


performance
 package
 and
 if
 there
 was
 a


way
 of
 delivering
 the
 uh
 the
 vote


without
 the
 actual
 compensation
 we
 would


have
 done
 that
 but
 but
 from
 our


perspective
 there
 was
 no
 way
 of
 doing


that.
 So


>> can
 you
 can
 you
 do
 that
 with
 a
 voting


shares
 that
 have
 a
 like
 a
 supermajority


vote?
 You
 can,
 but
 you
 can
 only
 put
 them


in
 place
 before
 you
 IPO.
 And
 so
 that's


why
 some
 of
 the
 other
 uh
 technology


companies
 have
 those
 in
 place.
 Um,
 but


>> Elon's
 going
 to
 get
 it
 done,
 dude.
 He's


going
 to
 get
 it
 done.
 I
 think


overwhelmingly
 shareholders
 will
 vote


with
 Elon
 and
 Video
 trying
 to
 crack
 191.


Um,
 you
 know,
 I
 know
 he's
 a
 little


worried
 about
 it
 and
 that's
 why
 Tesla's


been
 advertising
 more,
 but
 it
 seems
 very


unlikely
 the
 retail
 shareholder
 base


lets
 him
 down,
 even
 if
 the
 institutional


investor
 services
 try
 to
 vote
 against


it.


Last
 time
 it
 was
 7030,
 right?
 Or
 7525
 on


the
 $55
 billion
 deal
 that
 the
 Delaware


judge
 struck
 down.
 I
 would
 imagine
 7030


is
 the
 same
 split
 this
 time.


And
 Elon
 should
 be
 able
 to
 get
 this


done.


Gerald
 says,
 "Happy
 birthday.
 My
 mother


is
 now
 104
 today."
 Wow.
 Happy
 birthday


to
 your
 mother,
 Gerald.
 That's


incredible.
 I
 love
 it.
 Super
 super
 super


cool.
 We
 got
 a
 uh
 we
 got
 a
 bunch
 of
 the


October
 babies
 in
 the
 chat.
 So,
 happy


birthday
 to
 your
 mother
 as
 well.
 Send


her
 my
 well
 wishes


and
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Pedro


says,
 "Listening
 to
 you
 from
 the
 gym


this
 morning.
 Great
 combo,
 Pedro.
 I
 love


it.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here
 as
 well."


Pedro,
 I
 remember
 your
 your
 daughter
 got


married
 a
 couple
 months
 ago.
 So,
 uh


super
 super
 exciting
 time
 in
 your
 life


as
 well.
 And
 dude,
 the
 fact
 see
 this
 is


why
 it's
 so
 cool
 like
 with
 the
 community


we
 built.
 Like
 the
 fact
 that
 I
 even
 saw


your
 name
 and
 I
 remembered,
 oh
 yeah,
 I


remember
 your
 daughter
 got
 married.
 like


that
 just
 like
 the
 things
 we
 all
 know


about
 each
 other
 in
 the
 chat.
 It
 is
 just


so
 it's
 different,
 dude.
 It
 really
 is


what
 culminates
 into,
 you
 know,
 having
 a


community
 that
 you
 love
 and
 care
 about,


even
 if
 you
 disagree
 with
 them
 on
 stock


picks,
 right?
 Like
 that
 that
 becomes


rather
 irrelevant
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the


humanity
 of
 a
 community.
 So,


super
 super
 cool.
 Very
 very very
 blessed


for
 all
 the
 people
 that
 that
 voted
 happy


birthday.
 Michelle
 says
 a
 my
 mom
 says


happy
 birthday.
 Michelle,
 let
 your
 mom


know
 that
 I
 love
 her
 and
 I'm
 happy
 that


she's
 doing
 well.
 If
 she's
 watching,


Michelle's
 mom,
 uh,
 your
 daughter
 bakes


the
 best
 cakes.
 And
 I
 don't
 have
 a


birthday
 cake.
 I
 didn't
 I
 didn't
 get
 one


shipped
 from
 Houston.
 I
 don't
 know
 why


that
 didn't
 happen
 today,
 but
 I
 would


like
 to
 see
 a
 pounder
 and
 hood
 logo
 on


some
 cupcakes
 for
 me.
 Uh,
 it
 was
 Drake's


birthday
 a
 few
 days
 ago.
 That
 is


correct.
 We
 are
 both
 October
 babies.


both
 Scorpios
 as
 well.


Femi
 says,
 "I
 told
 my
 girlfriend
 that


it's
 your
 birthday
 and
 she
 got
 happier


than
 with
 mine."


That's
 That's
 hilarious.


That
 is
 hilarious.
 Nvidia
 right
 there.


190
 pounder
 191.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 pounder


alltime
 highs


is
 fun
 birthday
 present.
 Fun
 birthday


present.
 It's
 holding
 it,
 dude.
 I
 mean,


maybe
 it
 falls
 back
 below
 190,
 but
 it's


holding
 it
 pretty
 heavy.
 And
 then
 hoodie


as
 well,
 146.90.


Not
 too
 bad
 either.


Okay,
 what
 else
 do
 we
 have?
 Do
 we
 have


any
 other
 headlines?
 It's
 already
 11:00


a.m.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 have
 any
 other


headlines.
 If
 not,
 I
 will
 read
 these


super
 chats
 and
 we'll
 be
 done
 for
 the


day.


Um,


Orbs
 filed
 a
 2.7
 billion
 at
 the
 market


offering.
 might
 want
 to
 be
 a
 little


careful
 if
 you're
 betting
 on
 orbs.


Again,
 I
 think
 you
 can
 get
 exposure


through
 it
 through
 Bit
 Mine,
 but
 it


looks
 like
 you
 will
 be
 having
 some


billions
 that
 are
 diluted
 pretty
 soon.


Orbs
 right
 there,
 638.
 That's
 red
 on
 the


day.


Uh
 Oaklow
 that
 continues
 to
 go
 down


2.6%.


Nvidia
 is
 up
 2.4.
 SoFi
 is
 up
 2.3.


D-Wave
 massive
 day
 right
 here
 12.8.


Don't
 know
 if
 there's
 any
 news.
 I
 think


that's
 separating
 from
 the
 other
 quantum


names.


Uh,
 kind
 of.
 The
 other
 ones
 are
 up
 a


decent
 chunk
 as
 well.
 D-Wave's
 the
 one


that's
 up
 the
 most.
 Maybe
 there's
 a


partnership
 right
 there,
 but
 that
 one's


going
 green.
 S&P
 682,
 that's
 holding
 up.


Red
 at
 219.
 Cisco
 DLO.
 VIX
 up
 a
 little


bit,
 but
 still
 red
 for
 the
 day.
 So,


you're
 getting
 some
 of
 those
 red
 candles


given
 the
 VIX
 is
 up
 just
 a
 little
 bit.


Google
 just
 below
 266.


And


you're
 seeing
 some
 more
 green.


You're
 seeing
 a
 decent
 decent
 chunk


of
 green
 right
 here.
 Government
 shutdown


updates.
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 ton
 of
 updates


on
 that
 other
 than
 what
 Hasset
 said
 last


week
 that
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 shutdown


will
 come
 to
 an
 end
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


week.
 Then
 again,
 he
 said
 that
 last


week.
 It's
 a
 new
 week.
 We
 don't
 have
 a


shutdown


uh
 resolution,
 but


hopefully
 that
 happens
 soon.
 Such
 has


decided
 to
 convert
 the
 PayPal
 leaf's


position
 from
 good
 size
 to
 truckload


size.
 Bought
 a
 lot
 more
 at
 825.
 Let's


see
 how
 this
 goes.
 Wow.


All
 right,
 Sachin,
 you
 are
 putting
 your


name
 out
 there
 on
 these
 PayPal
 leaps.


Let's
 see
 the
 quarter
 they
 deliver


tomorrow.
 I
 mean,
 if
 that
 quarter
 is
 a


uh


is
 a
 new
 quarter
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 life
 of


the
 narrative
 of
 the
 company,


maybe
 these
 leaps
 work
 out
 really
 well.


AMD
 energy
 secretary
 says
 partnership


will
 supercharge
 advances
 in
 nuclear


techch,
 defense,
 and
 cancer
 treatments.


All
 right,
 so
 some
 good
 excitement


around
 these
 uh
 partnerships
 with
 AMD


and
 the
 energy
 sector.


All
 right,
 cool.
 I
 think
 that's
 it,


guys.
 Uh
 I
 will
 get
 through
 these
 super


chats,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 any


more
 market
 news.
 I'll
 be
 back
 on
 the


close.
 So
 for
 those
 that
 want
 to
 be


there
 on
 the
 close,
 we'll
 be
 there


tonight.
 We
 will
 still
 do
 Tech
 Bros
 with


Tanner
 and
 Roy
 at
 9:30.
 So
 we'll
 still


have
 the
 normal
 stream.
 We
 should
 still


have
 a
 daily
 recap
 as
 well.
 So
 pretty


much
 all
 parts
 of
 the
 schedule
 should
 be


okay.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 market
 close,


we'll
 do
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 fun
 birthday


stuff
 giveaway.
 And
 so
 for
 those
 that


want
 to
 be
 part
 of
 that,
 we'll
 visit


that
 on
 the
 close.


But
 I
 think
 that's
 pretty
 much
 it
 today.


Summary
 of
 today
 is
 market
 momentum


seems
 strong.
 some
 of
 the
 more


speculative
 names
 getting
 hit,
 some
 of


them
 not
 getting
 hit.
 So,
 it's
 a
 little


bit
 of a
 stock
 pickers
 market
 right


there.
 S&P
 basically
 up
 1%
 on
 the
 day.


SoFi
 earnings
 tomorrow
 is
 really
 going


to
 set
 the
 tone
 for
 some
 of
 the
 fintexs.


PayPal's
 tomorrow.
 UNH
 is
 tomorrow.
 Then


Wednesday,
 FOMC
 along
 with
 all
 the
 big


tech
 earnings.
 That
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


massive
 day.
 I
 might
 stream
 the
 entire


day
 to
 be
 honest
 on
 Wednesday.
 So,
 we're


going
 to
 see.
 And
 then
 Palenter
 and
 Hood


alltime
 highs
 along
 with
 Nvidia
 getting


back
 to
 190
 seems
 pretty
 bullish.


admit
 we
 don't
 trust
 you
 after
 you


ghosted
 us
 on
 the
 Friday
 clothes.
 Dude,


I
 was
 telling
 Steve
 last
 night
 I
 was


like
 something
 happened
 on
 Friday.
 I


don't
 know
 what
 was
 h
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 I


like
 I
 just
 really
 couldn't
 like
 I
 just


fell
 asleep
 like
 I
 couldn't
 even
 wake


up.


I
 was
 I
 was
 like
 shivering.
 It
 was
 it


was
 just
 weird,
 bro.
 It
 was
 a
 weird


feeling.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 I
 just
 needed
 to


take
 that
 time
 off.
 But
 we're
 back,


baby.


We
 are
 back.
 Yep.
 Amcore
 earnings
 after


the
 bell.
 We'll
 take
 a
 look
 at
 that
 as


well.
 and
 uh
 we'll
 get
 into
 all
 these


stocks.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 think
 the
 summary
 of


the
 day
 is
 you're
 seeing
 some
 really


strong
 momentum
 based
 on
 this
 China
 news


coming
 to
 a
 conclusion
 which
 we
 don't


really
 have
 a
 deal
 yet,
 but
 we
 have
 a


framework
 of
 a
 deal
 that
 seems
 like
 the


market
 is
 conducive
 to
 that.
 You've
 got


rate
 cuts,
 you've
 got
 earnings
 that
 have


been
 good
 so
 far.
 We
 had
 the
 draw
 down.


We
 had
 a
 shake
 out
 of
 some
 froth.
 You


have
 the
 pain
 to
 get
 to
 the
 gains
 now.


And
 hopefully
 this
 gives
 us
 the
 next
 leg


as
 we
 get
 into


we
 get
 into
 November.


Tired
 and
 shivering.
 It
 sounds
 like
 you


were
 just
 sick.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 so.
 But
 I


didn't
 have
 a
 fever.
 So,
 it
 wasn't
 like


I
 was
 sick
 to
 the
 point
 where
 I
 need
 to


like
 go
 to
 the
 hospital
 or
 anything.
 It


was
 just
 like
 I
 just
 didn't
 feel
 the


best.
 And
 like
 even
 the
 thought
 of
 like


talking
 for
 three
 hours,
 which
 you
 know,


I
 love
 to
 talk
 for
 three
 hours.
 I
 just


like
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 bro,
 I
 cannot
 do


this
 today.
 And
 so,
 I
 thought
 it
 made


more
 sense
 to
 just


take
 a
 day
 off
 versus
 try
 to
 try
 to


force
 it.


But
 we're
 back.
 We
 are
 back,
 baby.


28
 years
 old
 and
 we
 are
 back.
 All right,


so
 let's
 get
 into
 these
 super
 chats.


Again,
 thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 I
 said
 to
 not
 send
 the
 super
 chats


because
 I
 don't
 want
 people
 to
 spend


money
 on
 my
 birthday,
 but
 nonetheless,


you
 guys
 sent
 the
 super
 chat,
 so
 I


appreciate
 it
 and
 thank
 you
 all
 for


being
 here.
 Alex,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 a


channel
 member.
 Says,
 "Happy
 birthday."


Thank
 Alex
 means
 a
 lot.
 Uh
 Feimos,
 thank


you
 for
 being
 a
 channel
 member
 as
 well,


saying
 happy
 birthday,
 Myth.
 Chris,


thank
 you
 for
 being
 here
 and
 being
 a


channel
 member.
 Drago,


appreciate
 you,
 brother.
 Drago
 has
 been


along
 for
 the
 pounder
 right
 since
 16.


Randomly
 found
 my
 channel
 back
 in


February
 2024


and
 he
 hopped
 on
 and
 then
 I
 think
 he


hopped
 on
 to
 hood
 at
 around
 20
 30
 bucks


as
 well.
 So
 Drago,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


very
 very
 kind
 $100
 super
 chat.
 Means
 a


lot
 and
 thank
 for
 being
 part
 of
 the


show.

 super
 chat

well.
 Happy
 birthday
 to
 you.
 Thank
 you,


George.
 Means
 a
 lot,
 George.
 I
 think


you've
 been
 following
 for
 the
 past


couple
 years
 as
 well.
 I've
 seen
 your


name
 so
 many
 times
 in
 the
 chat,
 so


deeply
 appreciate
 that.
 Uh,
 Arc
 Moments,


thank
 you
 for
 the
 $28
 from
 Singapore.


Means
 a
 ton.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.


Mrs.
 Kim,
 thanks
 for
 the
 five
 bucks.


Happy
 birthday,
 mate.
 Thanks
 for
 all
 you


do.
 PS.
 Lay
 off
 the
 grinder.


Yes,
 that
 was
 the
 actual
 reason
 why
 I


missed
 Friday.
 But
 I
 I
 appreciate
 now.


Now
 that
 they've
 acquired
 been
 acquired,


I
 I
 think
 I
 should
 be
 able
 to
 lay
 off


them.
 So,
 thank
 you,
 Mrs.
 Kim,
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 Uh,
 Eugen,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


50
 bucks.
 Happy
 birthday.
 Thank
 you
 for


showing
 up
 and
 always
 providing
 great


commentary
 on
 the
 market.
 It's
 been


super
 valuable.
 Eugene,
 appreciate
 you


being
 here
 and
 2026.
 I
 just
 want
 to
 make


sure
 that
 the
 content
 continues
 to
 be


valuable,
 bringing
 in
 more
 guests,
 more


data,
 all
 these
 different
 things.


Hopefully
 get
 the
 content
 to
 be
 up
 to


speed.
 So,
 thank
 you
 again
 for
 being


here.
 Uh,
 Katherine,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


$25
 super
 chat.
 Wishing
 you
 a
 happy


birthday
 in
 a
 green
 market.
 It's
 nice
 to


see
 some
 alltime
 highs
 on
 the
 birthday.


So,
 definitely
 a
 great
 present.
 Thank


you,
 Katherine.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 Marissa,
 thank
 you.
 Thanks
 to


Emit's
 parents
 for
 giving
 us
 AIT
 and


letting
 him
 be
 a
 financial
 YouTuber.
 I


gotta
 take
 a
 picture
 of
 that.
 I
 gotta
 I


gotta
 send
 this
 to
 my
 mom.
 Thank
 you,


Marissa.
 Appreciate
 it.
 Yeah,
 you
 know,


shout
 out
 to


Shout
 out
 to
 mom
 and
 dad
 that
 let
 me
 be


a
 be
 a
 YouTuber.
 Dude,
 it's
 it's
 it's


definitely,
 you
 know,
 it
 wasn't
 the


easiest
 thing
 for
 them
 because
 again,
 I


was
 supposed
 to
 be
 a
 doctor
 or
 a
 lawyer


or
 an
 engineer
 or,
 you
 know,
 something


more
 in
 line
 that
 is
 not
 as
 creative.


But,
 dude,
 they
 really
 let
 me
 just


figure
 it
 out.
 they
 just
 gave
 me
 the


time
 and
 energy
 to
 figure
 it
 out.
 And
 um


you
 know
 given
 given
 the
 debate
 career
 I


think
 they
 knew
 there
 was
 potential
 and


then
 it
 was
 just
 a
 question
 of
 can
 do
 do


you
 have
 the
 work
 ethic
 and
 the
 ambition


to
 live
 up
 to
 that
 potential.
 You
 know
 I


was
 talking
 with
 the
 author
 of
 this
 book


last
 night
 as
 well
 and
 uh
 there
 was
 a


moment
 in
 the
 book
 where
 Karp
 told
 the


author
 that
 he
 just
 wanted
 $250,000
 and


to
 just
 go
 live
 and
 do
 whatever
 he
 wants


in
 life
 with
 that
 nest
 egg
 of
 250.
 And


the
 author
 was
 telling
 me
 when
 Karp
 was


saying
 that
 to
 him
 I
 didn't
 believe
 him


because
 Karp
 was
 too
 ambitious.
 You


know,
 you
 might
 have
 this
 dream
 about


just
 like
 having
 enough
 money
 and
 then


just
 going
 off
 and
 doing
 whatever.
 But


like
 when
 someone's
 super
 ambitious,


it's
 really
 hard
 to
 neglect
 the


necessity
 that
 they
 have
 to
 go
 do


something
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 uh
 you
 know,


thankfully
 my
 parents
 let
 me
 just
 let
 me


go
 out
 and
 do
 it.
 So,
 thank
 you
 Marissa.


Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here
 and
 thank
 you


for
 being
 part
 of
 the
 channel.
 Uh
 Friday


Nebula,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $50
 super


chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 M.
 Hope
 you
 have
 a


good
 one,

 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 $50


super
 chat.
 Deeply
 means
 a
 lot
 again
 for


everyone
 sending
 the
 money.
 You
 guys
 do


not
 have
 to
 do
 this,
 but
 thank
 you
 for


that.
 Thanks
 for
 being
 here,
 Andy.
 Happy


two
 shares
 of
 Grab.
 Enjoy
 your
 day,
 bro.


You
 deserve
 nothing
 but
 the
 best.
 Andy


was
 at
 the
 first
 New
 York
 City
 meetup.
 I


signed
 his
 cowbell,
 which
 was
 crazy.
 It


was
 absolutely
 crazy.
 Thank
 you,
 Andy.


Means
 a
 lot.
 And
 thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 Vin,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $50
 super


chat.
 Got
 to
 meet
 Vin
 in
 California.
 Got


to
 have
 some
 coffee
 with
 him.
 I
 mean,


like,
 the
 fact
 that
 I've
 met
 so
 many
 of


you
 throughout
 the
 entire
 year
 also


makes
 me
 really
 happy.
 And
 I
 want
 to


continue
 that
 in
 26
 with
 the
 meetups.


But
 thank
 you,
 Ben.
 means
 a
 lot.
 Coffee


was
 awesome.
 And
 hopefully
 we
 get
 to


meet
 again
 in
 California
 soon.
 I'm


Benny.


You
 got
 Benny's
 plaque
 right
 there


behind
 me.
 Happy
 birthday,
 King.
 We


appreciate
 you.
 There's
 not
 enough
 good


things
 I
 can
 say
 about
 Benny,
 dude.
 He's


he
 was
 at
 the
 Miami
 meetup.
 Absolutely


has
 been
 pivotal
 to
 the
 growth
 of
 just


like
 this
 community,
 being
 part
 of
 it.


First
 of
 all,
 he
 he
 rang
 the
 bell
 on


Google
 for
 like
 eight
 months
 straight.


So,
 if
 anyone
 saw
 his
 comments
 in
 the


chat,
 you
 probably
 were
 influenced
 by


Google.
 Uh,
 but
 number
 two,
 he's
 he's


been
 with
 me
 on
 the
 hood
 journey,
 you


know,
 since
 it
 was
 10
 bucks.
 So,
 and


really
 helped
 me
 with
 my
 due
 diligence.


So,
 deeply
 appreciate
 you
 being
 in
 the


chat
 every
 day,
 man.
 And
 thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 And,
 uh,
 just
 thank
 you
 for


being
 a
 vital
 asset
 to
 the
 entire


community
 that,
 you
 know,
 needs
 people


every
 single
 day
 to
 to
 help
 moderate
 and


keep
 this
 community
 going
 the
 way
 it
 is.


So,
 thank
 you,
 Benny.
 Love
 you,
 brother.


Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.

Finally,
 let's
 break
 the
 world
 record


for
 most
 super
 chats
 in
 one
 session
 for


a
 non-charity.
 Although,
 some
 of
 you


might
 say
 Amit
 is
 a
 charity
 case.


Oh
 my
 gosh.
 Please,
 let's
 not
 break
 the


record.
 I
 think
 we
 already
 broke
 the


record
 on
 the
 100,000
 subscriber
 uh


celebration,
 but
 thank
 you,
 Bob.


Appreciate

 these
 like
 like


these
 these
 crazy
 names.
 But
 I'
 I've


been
 talking
 to
 you
 know
 like
 it's
 like


you
 know
 when
 you're
 at
 an
 office
 and


you
 have
 like
 Johnny
 and
 Jake
 and
 you're


at
 the
 water
 cooler
 and
 you're
 talking


about
 life
 like
 I'm
 talking
 with
 shem


pasta
 about
 the
 markets


for
 the
 past
 four
 years.
 So
 it's
 just


it's
 super
 super
 cool


for
 everyone
 to
 be
 part
 of
 this


community.
 Oh
 my
 goodness,
 dude.
 We
 have


like
 80
 more
 super
 chats.
 All right,


here
 we
 go.
 I'm
 gonna
 be
 here
 for
 a


while.
 I'm
 if
 if
 this
 is
 boring
 to
 some


people,
 I'm
 sorry,
 but
 I
 want
 to
 get


through
 all
 these.
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys
 in


the
 market
 close,


but
 uh
 I
 do
 want
 to
 get
 to
 all
 these


individually.
 So,


thank
 you
 all
 for
 being
 here.
 All
 right,


so
 um
 Vlad,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $20
 chat.


Happy
 birthday,
 Emit.
 Really
 appreciate


what
 you're
 doing
 for
 this
 community.


Hopefully,
 someone
 will
 write
 a
 book


about
 you
 one
 day
 and
 how
 you
 affected


many
 lives.
 Vlad,
 appreciate
 you
 being


here.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 after
 reading
 this


book,
 I've
 just
 got
 more
 excited
 about


writing
 and
 reading
 again.
 I
 mean,


really,
 I
 I
 didn't
 finish
 the
 full
 book,


but
 I
 finished
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 it
 on


Saturday
 night.
 No
 distractions.
 No


phone,
 no
 Twitter,
 no
 YouTube.
 So,
 you


know,
 who
 knows?
 I
 I
 definitely
 am


getting
 a
 lot
 more
 excited
 about
 books


again.
 And
 so,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super


chat
 and
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.


Informed.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 $200
 super


chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 Emit.
 Again,
 thank


you.
 This
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 Deeply,


deeply
 appreciated.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank


you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 $200
 super
 chat


and
 uh
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.

 Matt


Money,
 we
 know
 Matt
 Money
 gave
 out
 20


gifted
 memberships,
 so
 appreciate
 you,


Matt
 Money.
 And
 uh
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 a


friend
 of
 the
 channel.
 Friday,
 Sam,


thank
 you
 also
 for
 being
 here.


and
 being
 a
 channel
 member.
 Uh,
 Lady
 D7,


thanks
 for
 the
 20
 bucks.
 Happy
 birthday,


Amit.
 I
 can't
 go
 a
 day
 without
 tuning
 in


at least
 twice
 a
 day.
 Love
 your
 channel


in
 this
 community.
 You
 have
 helped
 me


grow
 my
 account
 since
 joining
 on


February
 2024.
 I
 appreciate
 all
 you
 do


for
 us
 every
 day.


From
 Denine.
 Denine,


deeply
 appreciate
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 Uh,
 again,
 when
 you
 when
 you


say
 you
 guys,
 you
 know,
 admit
 you've


helped
 me
 grow
 my
 account,
 it
 is
 very


very
 humbling
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of the


day,
 I
 was
 not
 the
 person
 who
 pressed


buy
 or
 sell.
 Uh
 but
 I
 I I
 do
 think
 the


the
 the
 community
 of
 all
 of
 us
 being


together
 is
 what
 helps
 people
 find


ideas,
 right?
 Or
 people
 avoid
 certain


stocks
 or
 people
 to,
 you
 know,
 do


specific
 option
 strategies
 like
 all
 of


us
 collectively
 putting
 those
 ideas


there.
 Um
 is
 what
 has
 led
 to
 some
 of


this
 momentum.
 And
 again,
 you
 know,
 the


the
 these
 these
 very
 high-
 netw
 worth,


you
 know,
 private
 investors,
 they
 spend


millions
 of
 dollars
 a
 year
 on
 consulting


and
 financial
 advice.
 You
 know,
 a
 lot
 of


us
 don't
 do
 that.
 A
 lot
 of
 us
 just
 have


each
 other.
 And
 quite
 frankly,
 over
 the


past
 couple
 years,
 a
 lot
 of
 that


financial
 advice
 that
 people
 pay


millions
 of
 dollars
 for
 has
 been


worthless
 because
 none
 of
 it
 has


actually
 worked.
 And
 so
 the
 fact
 that


all
 of
 us
 have
 crowdsourced
 all
 that


information,


whether
 it's
 on
 a
 Nebus
 or
 a
 pounder,


hood
 or
 rock
 lab
 or
 sofa,
 I
 mean,
 Matt


money,
 right?
 Part
 of
 this
 community
 got


everyone
 to
 look
 at
 Rock
 Lab
 at
 four


bucks,
 like
 that's
 what
 really
 makes
 it


worth
 makes
 it
 worthwhile.
 So


really,
 really
 cool
 for
 everyone
 to
 be


here.
 Hi,
 thank
 you
 for
 becoming
 a


channel
 member.
 Pro
 Catch,
 thank
 you
 for


the
 $5.
 Happy
 birthday,
 M.
 Thank
 you
 for


being
 here
 and
 uh
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 a


channel
 member.
 Richard
 Bros,
 thank
 you


for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Last
 week
 I
 was
 uh


trading
 but
 I
 saw
 a
 quick
 rise
 up.
 Thank


you.
 It
 was
 it
 was
 helpful
 to
 see
 your


loss
 as
 well.
 So
 I
 wasn't
 the
 only
 one


who
 was
 losing
 like
 crazy.
 Now
 I'm


looking
 forward
 to
 another
 day
 on
 the


way
 to
 a
 million.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,


it's
 important
 to
 celebrate
 the
 good


with
 the
 bad,
 right?
 Like
 yesterday
 I
 I


said
 I
 was
 down
 140,000.
 Today
 I'm
 up


78,000.
 I
 mean
 like
 a
 lot
 A
 lot
 of
 what


was
 lost
 last
 week
 was
 recovered
 on
 from


Friday
 as
 well.
 I
 mean,
 like
 it's
 really


important
 to
 just
 share
 the
 bad
 days


with
 the
 good
 days.
 It
 sucks
 some
 of


those
 days,
 but
 all
 of
 us
 go
 through
 it


and
 uh
 you
 know,
 everyone
 if
 we're
 in
 a


lot
 of
 these
 same
 names
 or
 even
 if


you're
 in
 other
 names,
 it's
 it's
 really


difficult
 to
 avoid
 the
 red.


So,
 we
 celebrate
 the
 green
 together
 and


we
 uh
 you
 know,
 we
 cry
 together
 in
 the


red,
 but
 doing
 it
 together
 definitely


helps.
 Vic,
 thank
 you
 for
 becoming
 a


channel
 member.
 Appreciate
 you
 being


here.

It
 means
 a
 lot.
 There's

 so
 we'll
 try

keep
 crushing
 it
 for
 them.
 Thank
 you

 Happy

 May

 tight,


you
 know.
 Shout
 out
 to
 my
 dentist.
 She's


a
 lovely
 woman,
 and
 she's
 uh,
 you
 know,


been
 incredible.
 She
 definitely
 helped


my
 root
 canal
 two
 weeks
 ago
 when
 I
 could


barely
 talk.
 So,


I
 appreciate
 you,
 Amidst
 Dentists,
 for


being
 part
 of
 the
 chat.


You
 guys
 are
 wild,
 bro.
 You
 guys
 are


actually
 wild.
 And
 if
 she
 actually
 is
 in


the
 chat,
 she's
 probably
 laughing
 right


now,
 but
 you
 guys
 are
 wild.
 Ar
 boy,


thank
 you
 for
 being
 a
 channel
 member
 as


well.
 Thank
 you

 wish.


Mila,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Been


watching
 you
 daily
 for
 a
 few
 months
 now.


I
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 because
 of
 you.


Have
 a
 good
 birthday
 and
 hopefully
 no


raw
 steak
 this
 time.
 You
 know,
 I


actually
 had
 I
 would
 say
 medium
 rare


last
 week
 with
 Steve
 and
 I
 actually


liked
 it.
 So
 maybe
 I'm
 becoming
 a
 little


bit
 more
 of
 a
 medium
 rare
 guy.
 But
 thank


you
 for
 being
 here.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being


part
 of
 the

 and
 deeply
 deeply


appreciate

 being

 go
 from


strength
 to
 strength.
 Thanks

everything
 you've
 done
 allowing

 and


my
 family
 to
 secure
 financial


independence.
 Deeply,
 deeply,
 deeply


appreciated.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 super


chat
 bike
 pimp.
 I
 think
 you
 were
 in


pounder
 early.
 Uh
 I
 also
 think
 you
 took


some
 good
 profits
 and
 you've
 been
 able


to
 really
 change
 your
 life
 with
 some
 of


that
 money.
 So,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here


and
 again,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 part
 of


the
 channel.


These
 dentist
 comments,
 bro,


dude,
 she
 fixed
 my
 root
 canal.
 She


really
 fixed
 she
 fixed
 my
 root
 canal.
 By


the
 way,
 Tessy
 453.


Tessy
 making
 a
 move
 right
 here.
 She's


not
 stopping


that
 one.
 Getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


breakout.
 Qualcomm,
 we
 are
 still
 at
 190.


That's
 losing
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 love.


Nvidia
 still
 190.
 Halen
 share
 190.7


hoodie
 just
 below
 147
 and
 then
 Tesla
 up


5%
 on
 the
 day.


All
 right,
 you're
 getting
 some
 love
 on


uh
 on
 Tessy.
 Ricardo,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 A
 small
 present.
 Happy


birthday
 and
 thank
 you
 for
 all
 the
 work


you
 put
 into
 the
 show
 and
 the
 community.


Ricardo,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Thank


you
 for
 being
 part
 of
 the
 channel.


Deeply
 deeply
 appreciated.
 Brady,
 thank


you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Please
 have
 the


RCAT
 CEO
 on.
 I'm
 going
 to
 reach
 out
 to


him.
 I
 think
 we'll
 get
 the
 Redcat
 CEO


on.
 I've
 interviewed
 him
 a
 couple
 months


ago.
 I
 definitely
 think
 he
 would
 be
 down


to
 be
 on
 the
 show
 again.
 So,
 I'll
 inter


I'll
 reach
 out
 to
 him
 and
 I'll
 see
 if
 uh


if
 we
 can
 get
 him
 on
 hopefully
 this


week.
 I
 mean,
 that
 deal
 they
 announced


this
 morning
 was
 pretty
 strong
 deal
 in


the
 broader
 drone
 space.
 So,
 that
 should


continue
 to
 help.
 Chris,
 thanks
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday
 and
 thank
 you


for
 all
 you
 do.
 I
 never
 had
 money.
 I


started
 2023.
 I
 found
 you.
 Started
 with


3K.
 Now,
 I'm
 at
 73K.
 Put
 every
 cent
 I


had
 into
 stocks.
 Wow.
 Congratulations.


Congratulations.
 Again,
 you
 know,
 this


is
 the
 bifurcation
 of
 not
 only
 the


American
 economy,
 but
 the
 global


economy,
 right?
 You
 you
 either
 have


assets
 or
 you
 don't.
 It
 is
 the
 harsh


reality
 of
 either
 you
 have
 your
 money


compounding.
 Even
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 all


the
 concerns
 about
 bubbly,
 toppy,
 all


that
 stuff
 like
 still
 having
 your
 money


compounding
 in
 assets
 is
 better
 than
 it


likely
 being
 on
 the
 sidelines.
 Uh


especially
 if
 you're
 trying
 to
 gain
 that


initial
 level
 of
 a
 nest
 egg
 that


everyone
 is
 looking
 for
 to
 to
 set
 up


some
 level
 of
 financial
 freedom.
 So,


the
 markets
 are
 incredible.
 You
 know,


the
 past
 three
 years
 have
 been
 amazing.


It's
 not
 always
 going
 to
 be
 like
 this,


but
 in
 in
 I
 think
 we've
 done
 hopefully
 a


decent
 job
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 years


analyzing
 the
 macro
 trends
 that
 are


staring
 us
 right
 in
 the
 face,
 right?


It's
 hard
 to
 kind
 of
 avoid
 what's


happening
 in
 front
 of
 us
 and
 it
 likely


qualifies
 for
 a
 for
 an
 investment


opportunity.
 So,


thank
 you,
 sir,
 for
 being
 here,
 bro.


Never
 going
 to
 finish
 the
 stream.
 I
 I


don't
 know
 if
 I'm
 going
 to
 finish
 the


stream.
 How
 many
 more
 do
 we
 have
 left?


Oh
 my
 goodness,
 we
 have
 like
 50
 left.


All right,
 we're
 gonna
 be
 here.


We're
 gonna
 be
 here
 for
 a
 minute,
 folks.


Here
 we
 go.
 Uh
 Sh,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 Appreciate
 you,
 man.
 It
 was


awesome
 seeing
 you
 at
 the
 New
 York


meetup
 as
 well.
 Hopefully
 you
 get
 to


come
 out
 again.
 He
 was
 almost
 going to


be
 at
 the
 Miami
 meetup,
 but
 last
 minute


couldn't
 make
 it.
 So
 hopefully
 we
 see


you
 there
 again.
 Star
 Buccaneers,
 thank


you
 for
 the
 gifted
 10.
 Appreciate
 it.


Star
 Buccaneers
 has
 been
 watching
 for
 at


least
 three,
 four
 years
 now.
 Um


so
 yeah,
 appreciate
 you,
 man.
 It's
 been


awesome
 growing
 with
 you.
 both
 been
 on


the
 Palentry
 journey
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 you


know,
 real
 friendships
 created
 as
 a


result
 of
 this
 entire
 community
 which


has
 just
 been
 super
 cool.
 So,
 thank
 you


for
 those
 gift
 to
 10
 memberships.
 Scott


as
 well,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 gift
 to
 10.


Appreciate
 it.
 Jace,
 thanks
 you
 for


being
 here.
 Fats
 invest,
 thank
 you
 for


the
 50
 bucks.
 Happy
 birthday,
 brother.


Enjoy
 your
 day.
 I
 think
 I
 got
 to
 know
 uh


you
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 ago
 as
 you
 started


tweeting
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 about
 Grab


and
 we
 got
 to
 know
 each
 other.
 So,


appreciate
 you,
 man.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the


$50.
 you
 do
 not
 need
 to
 send
 that,
 but


deeply
 deeply
 appreciate


the
 uh
 the
 the
 super
 chat
 and
 for
 being


here.
 Um


birthday
 full
 day
 stream.
 Yeah,
 maybe


maybe
 that's
 what
 happens.
 Elaine,
 thank


you
 for
 the
 gifted
 50.
 Appreciate
 you,


Elaine.
 50
 of
 you
 guys
 just
 got
 that


gifted
 membership.
 Elaine,
 for
 those


that
 don't
 know,
 uh
 I
 believe
 I'm
 not


wrong.
 Maybe
 she
 sold
 a
 little
 bit,
 but


well
 over
 50,000
 shares
 of
 Palunteer
 and


she's
 been
 just
 milking
 it
 with
 the


covered
 calls
 uh
 for
 the
 past
 for
 the


past
 year
 now.
 So,
 appreciate
 you,


Elaine.
 I
 mean,
 Palunteer
 has
 been
 one


of
 the
 reasons
 why
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 connected


and
 on
 a
 day
 like
 this,
 alltime
 highs


definitely
 not
 the
 worst
 for
 those


60,000
 shares
 you
 got.
 But,
 thank
 you.


Thank
 you
 for
 spreading
 the
 love.
 Thank


you
 for
 the
 50
 gifted
 S&P
 500
 right


there.
 68336
 as
 well,
 nearing
 into
 that


all-time
 high
 on
 the
 daily.


And
 thank
 you,
 Elaine,
 for
 being
 here.


Thank
 you
 for
 those
 gifted.
 Elaine
 says


now
 it's
 65,000.
 Well,
 there
 you
 go.
 She


bought
 the
 dip,
 folks.
 She
 bought
 and


all
 those
 shares
 are
 basically
 free


given
 the
 covered
 call
 premium
 she's


collected.
 I
 mean,
 any
 share
 she
 buys
 a


pounder
 at
 this
 point
 or
 cost
 spaces,


which
 by
 the
 way,
 her
 average
 was
 $10.


So,
 with
 all
 the
 covered
 call
 premiums,


I
 think
 her
 average
 might
 be
 negative
 at


this
 point,
 meaning
 she
 literally
 got


paid
 to
 buy
 those
 60,000
 shares,
 which


is
 pretty
 incredible.
 Uh,
 why
 is
 he


investing?
 Thank
 you
 for
 becoming
 a


channel
 member.
 Nate,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


$28
 super

 and
 that
 is
 quite


incredible.
 So,
 thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 part
 of
 the


show.
 JC,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $20
 super


chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 M.
 Thanks
 for


everything.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.


Woody
 Trades,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $10


shipper
 here
 since
 $20
 pounder
 on
 the


down
 move.
 You've
 been
 such
 a
 huge
 part


of
 the
 day
 over
 the
 last
 couple
 years.


Love
 to
 see
 your
 successes.
 Pounder


changed
 my
 financial
 life.
 Happy


birthday
 to
 you.
 Woody,
 thank
 you
 for


being
 here
 as
 well.
 You
 know,
 the
 other


crazy
 thing
 about
 this
 whole
 um


this
 whole
 uh
 this
 whole
 this
 whole


thing
 with
 with
 with
 the
 community
 is


just
 like
 this
 whole
 being
 part
 of
 your


day
 thing.
 Um,
 and
 like
 you
 know
 the


fact
 that
 people
 just
 like
 they
 keep
 it


on
 whether
 it's
 in
 the
 background
 or


they're
 actively
 watching
 but
 it's
 like


part
 of
 their
 day.
 Uh,
 I
 really
 don't


take
 that
 for
 granted.
 I
 really
 don't.


You
 know,
 as
 as
 a
 creator,
 as
 or
 as


someone
 who
 I
 should
 say
 is
 creative,


you've
 always
 just
 wanted
 your
 art
 to


resonate
 with
 the
 world.
 I'm
 not
 saying


the
 market
 open
 is
 art
 or
 something,
 but


it's
 a
 form
 of
 creativity,
 which
 I
 guess


subjectively
 you
 could
 call
 it
 as
 a
 form


of
 art
 that
 uh
 resonates
 with
 people.
 I


mean,
 if
 you're
 a
 musician,
 you
 just


want
 your
 music
 to
 be
 listened
 to.
 If


you're
 an
 author,
 you
 just
 want
 people


to
 read
 your
 book.
 So,
 if
 you're
 a


content
 creator,
 you
 just
 want
 your


content
 to
 be
 consumed
 and,
 you
 know,


you
 want
 to
 do
 it
 in
 a
 way
 where
 people


enjoy
 consuming
 it.
 Uh,
 and
 and
 then


that,
 you
 know,
 that
 again,
 I
 say
 this


over
 and
 over
 again,
 but
 I
 I
 think


that's
 why
 the
 channel
 is
 growing.
 Like,


it's
 not
 about
 the
 money,
 it's
 not
 about


the
 numbers,
 it's
 about
 the
 love
 of


creating
 the
 show.
 Like,
 do
 you
 love
 the


game
 of
 doing
 it?
 And
 realistically,
 I


think
 it's
 applicable
 to
 every
 part
 of


life.
 If
 you
 love
 what
 you
 are
 doing
 and


you're
 doing
 it
 for
 the
 intrinsic
 fact


of
 doing
 it,
 because
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 I


would
 say
 when
 I
 wasn't
 making
 any
 money


on
 YouTube,
 I
 had
 the
 same
 amount
 of


energy
 that
 I
 have
 now
 with
 a
 lot
 more


people
 watching.
 Uh,
 that's
 what
 I
 think


resonates.
 It's
 it's
 I
 I
 I
 really
 do


think
 it's
 the
 most
 authentic
 way
 of


building
 any
 type
 of
 community
 or
 or


social
 media
 brand
 or
 or
 artistic


career.
 So,
 deeply
 deeply
 appreciate


those
 that
 enjoy
 being
 being
 part
 of


their
 day
 every
 day.
 Must,
 thanks
 for


the
 $10
 super
 Jed.
 Happy
 birthday,
 mate.


You've
 helped
 me
 reach
 the
 new
 highs
 in


my
 portfolio.
 Seven
 digits.
 Incredible.


And
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 have


reached
 that
 million-dollar
 level
 uh


over
 the
 past
 year
 and
 a
 half.
 And
 you


know,
 the
 fact
 that
 all
 of
 us
 have
 done


it
 in
 this
 community
 and
 you
 know,
 the


community
 has
 been
 a
 force
 to
 compound


that,
 it
 means
 a
 ton.
 Siege,
 thank
 you


for
 the
 20
 bucks.
 Thanks
 for
 everything


you
 do.
 I
 wish
 you
 a
 happy
 birthday
 and


healthy
 birthday.
 The
 money
 is
 in
 for


the
 channel,
 not
 for
 your
 birthday.


Siege,
 you
 give
 like
 20
 bucks
 every


single
 day.
 I
 appreciate
 you.


every
 single
 day
 with
 these
 super
 chats.


You
 don't
 have
 to
 do
 it,
 but
 thank
 you


so
 much
 for
 being
 here.
 Uh,
 Bose
 Spam,


thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 My
 grab
 calls


are
 up
 50%.
 Happy
 birthday
 to
 the


Grabfather.


Appreciate
 you,
 Bose.
 Bam.
 Hopefully,
 we


get
 a
 good
 earnings
 next
 Monday.


Hopefully,
 this
 can
 really
 start
 to
 to


make
 a
 move.
 We're
 going
 to
 see.
 Dude,
 I


had
 a
 dent.
 Okay,
 you
 guys
 are
 not
 going


to
 believe
 this
 [ __ ]
 You
 guys
 are
 legit


not
 going
 to
 believe
 this
 [ __ ]
 And
 I


don't
 want
 to
 show
 you
 the
 DM
 because
 I


want
 to
 respect
 the
 person's
 privacy,


but


there
 was
 a
 dentist
 going
 back
 to
 this


dentist.
 There's
 a
 dentist
 who
 messaged


me
 on
 October
 14th.
 Okay.
 And
 she
 said,


"Yes,
 it's
 a
 she,
 okay,
 is
 I'm
 not
 it's


not
 helping
 my
 case
 here,
 but
 I
 bought


Grab."


And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Cool.
 I
 I
 I
 think


they're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 good
 earnings."


Then
 yesterday,
 she
 texts
 me
 at
 8:30.


She's
 like,
 "I
 might
 have
 told
 another


200
 dentists
 about
 Grab,
 so
 please
 don't


let
 me
 down."
 And
 I'm
 like, "Goodness


gracious,
 bro."
 I'm
 like,
 "Okay,


I
 hope
 I
 hope
 it
 works
 out
 because
 now


you
 got
 200
 dentists
 that
 are
 part
 of


your
 network
 that
 are
 long
 grab,
 so
 this


[ __ ]
 better
 work
 out."
 But
 uh
 yes,
 I'm


sorry
 amidst
 dentists.
 I'm
 cheating
 on


you
 with
 a
 different
 dentist.
 But
 she


was
 like,
 "It's
 a
 little
 bit


disappointing
 it
 hasn't
 moved
 as
 much."


I
 was
 like,
 "Yeah,
 but
 look,
 I
 don't


know
 if
 dentists
 are
 used
 to


volatility."


Because
 I
 was
 like,
 "You
 could
 be
 in


something
 else
 that's
 a
 bit
 more


speculative.
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 if
 you


want
 to
 have,
 you
 know,
 people
 that
 work


in
 the
 medical
 field
 that
 have
 a
 lot
 of


debt
 that
 they
 have
 to
 pay
 back
 to
 their


medical
 school
 dealing
 with
 the


volatility."
 Like,
 Grab
 is
 something


where
 like,
 look,
 it
 may
 not
 move
 that


crazy,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 going
 to


move
 down
 that
 crazy
 either.


Whereas
 some
 of
 these
 other
 names,
 you


got
 to
 be
 really
 good
 with
 timing
 it.


And
 dentists
 are
 doing
 root
 canals
 and


cavity
 fillings
 all
 day,
 right?
 They're


not
 going to
 be
 timing,
 selling,
 or


buying


But
 uh
 yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 So,
 bro
 has
 a


dentist
 fetish.
 Oh
 my
 gosh.
 I
 see.
 This


is
 what
 I'm
 saying.
 Like,
 if
 I
 was
 like


saying
 XYZ
 stock
 that
 has
 no
 revenue,
 no


earnings
 is
 going
 to
 go
 to
 the
 moon
 and


everyone
 should
 get
 long
 on
 that.
 And


then
 you
 have
 a
 freaking
 dentist
 who
 is


telling
 200
 other
 dentists
 for
 whatever


reason
 to
 go
 buy
 that
 stock
 because
 she


saw
 me
 talk
 about
 it
 on
 Twitter
 and


she's
 like,
 "Oh,
 it
 looks
 smart.
 I'm


going
 to
 buy
 whatever
 name
 he's
 talking


about."
 That's
 a
 responsibility
 I
 take


very
 seriously.


And
 I
 would
 rather
 a
 stock
 be
 not


volatile,
 not
 have
 this
 explosive


massive
 move,
 but
 be
 safe
 like
 Grab
 that


has
 eight
 billion
 in
 cash
 if
 you're


going
 to
 tell
 all
 your
 dentist
 buddies


about
 it
 because
 the
 downside
 is
 limited


even
 if
 the
 upside
 is
 not
 as
 explosive


as
 like
 an
 Oaklo.
 And
 given
 what
 we've


seen
 has
 happened
 to
 Oaklo
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks,
 it's
 also
 not
 as
 bad
 as


the
 downside,
 right?
 So
 I
 I
 think
 one
 of


the
 biggest
 things
 of
 the
 channel


growing
 is
 just
 being
 very
 careful
 with


the
 stocks
 that
 I
 publicly
 associate


with
 because
 again
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


people
 are
 listening
 and
 people
 will
 do


whatever
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 just
 you


attaching
 your
 name
 to
 it
 if
 people


think
 you're
 a
 smart
 person
 and
 then


boom
 it's
 like
 then
 you're
 responsible


for
 it
 even
 though
 you're
 not
 really


responsible
 for
 it.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


something
 that
 you
 know
 is
 very


important
 to
 take
 seriously.
 And
 I
 and
 I


I
 find
 it
 odd
 that
 some
 people
 don't


take
 that
 responsibility
 seriously.


There's
 other
 influencers
 that
 just


don't
 give
 a
 [ __ ]
 They
 don't
 care.
 And


I'm
 just
 like,
 okay,
 that's
 fine.
 But


like,
 I
 really
 do
 care
 because
 that's


not
 something
 like
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 a


chimoth
 in
 2021
 that
 attaches
 my
 name
 to


something
 for
 the
 hell
 of
 it,
 knowing


that
 my
 name
 has
 some
 influence
 and
 that


it
 can
 move
 something
 and
 then
 you
 just


leave
 people
 holding
 the
 bag.
 That's


just
 not
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 can
 never
 live


with
 myself
 if
 that's
 how
 it
 would
 play


out.
 Trucker
 Rob,
 thank
 you

 the
 $10


super

 more
 about
 Amazon

 have


me

 Happy

 Emit.
 It's

 the
 Miami
 meetup,
 dude.

 Wow,

 uh,


first
 of
 all,
 thank
 you
 for
 coming
 to


the
 meetup.
 Meant
 a
 lot.
 You
 and
 your


wife
 are
 just
 amazing
 people.
 Uh
 you


guys
 you
 guys
 were
 a
 bright
 ray
 of


sunshine
 at
 the
 meetup.
 I
 mean
 you
 lit


up
 everywhere
 you
 talked
 to.
 You
 were


great
 interacting
 with
 people.
 I
 mean
 it


was
 just
 every
 time
 I
 saw
 you
 guys


talking
 with
 the
 people.
 They
 were


everyone
 was
 just
 laughing
 having
 a
 good


time.
 So
 it
 was
 really
 really
 cool


seeing
 you
 and
 your
 wife
 there
 and
 uh


yeah
 congrats
 on
 the
 anniversary.
 That's


so
 cool.
 All
 right
 so
 we
 got
 a
 birthday


and
 anniversary
 together
 for
 Carrington.


Thank
 you
 man.
 And
 please
 wish
 your
 wife


for
 me
 happy
 birthday
 or
 happy


anniversary
 if
 she's
 not
 watching.


deeply
 deeply
 appreciate
 you
 being
 part


of
 the
 show.
 Carrington
 actually
 is
 a


teacher
 and
 he
 was
 telling
 me
 that
 at


his
 job
 uh
 the
 day
 that
 JPAL
 was


speaking
 in
 August
 and
 everyone
 was


scared
 if
 he
 was
 going
 to
 pivot
 to
 like


ray
 cuts
 or
 not.
 His
 class
 was
 watching


my
 stream
 and
 they
 were
 like
 paper


trading
 because
 that
 that's
 what
 they


teach
 which
 is
 like
 you
 know
 pretty
 cool


class
 to
 actually
 be
 able
 to
 show
 people


how
 to
 trade
 and
 stuff
 like
 that.
 And


they
 were
 watching
 all
 of
 us
 live
 cover


JPAL
 which
 is
 crazy.


So


absolutely
 amazing.
 Carrington,
 thank


you
 for
 being
 here.
 Carlos,
 thanks
 for


the
 $20
 super
 chat.
 Appreciate
 you.


Pamela,

 Thank
 you

 being


here.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 first
 super
 chat


you've
 ever
 sent
 being
 on
 my
 channel.

 uh
 you

 really
 don't

 to
 do


it.

 of
 money
 off


your
 stream
 and
 chat.
 So,
 shout
 out
 to


the
 chat.
 Love
 you
 all.
 Aso,
 thank
 you


for
 being
 here.
 And
 yes,
 it
 is.
 It
 is


primarily
 because
 of
 the
 chat.
 I
 think


I'm
 just
 more
 of
 a
 messenger
 of
 a
 lot
 of


the
 information.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 at
 this


point,
 we
 have
 so
 many
 people
 in
 the


chat
 that
 if
 news
 is
 breaking,
 there's


like
 17
 people
 breaking
 the
 news
 in
 the


chat.
 So,
 it's
 almost
 like,
 you
 know,
 we


never
 have
 to
 worry
 about
 figuring
 out


what's
 happening
 because
 so
 many
 of
 you


guys
 are
 here
 updating
 it
 in
 real
 time


and
 uh,
 you
 know,
 just
 being
 part
 of
 the


community
 in
 general.
 Uh,
 Brazen,
 thank


you

 $20
 super

 It's
 milk
 time.

 though
 I
 hate
 it.
 Maybe

 we
 drink


some
 milk

 well.


Appreciate
 it.

 deeply
 deeply

 Rake,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.


Pedro,
 thanks
 for
 the
 $10
 super
 chat.


You're
 loved
 by
 many.
 First
 thing
 I


advise
 someone
 who
 wants
 to
 invest
 on


his
 or
 I
 point
 them
 to
 your
 channel
 and


suggest
 they
 go
 from
 there.
 Happy


birthday.
 That's
 another
 thing
 I
 really,


you
 know,
 deeply
 appreciate.
 A
 lot
 of


the
 word
 of
 mouth
 that
 has
 been
 spread


uh
 on
 the
 channel.
 A
 lot
 of
 you
 guys


just
 recommended
 the
 channel
 to
 a
 bunch


of
 different
 people
 and
 uh
 you
 know,


that's
 helped
 the
 channel
 grow
 and


there's
 so
 many
 people
 that
 just
 came


because
 their
 buddy
 texted
 them
 to
 start


watching
 the
 show
 and
 then
 it
 becomes


part
 of
 their
 routine.
 So,
 uh
 it
 it


really
 I
 mean,
 even
 Zo
 called
 I
 think
 Zo


he
 he
 texted
 his
 cousin
 to
 start


watching
 like
 a
 year
 ago.
 Now
 his


cousin's
 here
 every
 day.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of


that
 stuff
 really
 really
 means
 a
 lot
 to


me.
 S&P,
 by
 the
 way,
 still
 moving


higher.
 68344,


Nvidia
 191,
 Pounder
 190,
 Grab
 just
 above


6,
 SoFi
 just
 below
 30,
 S&P
 still
 doing


well,
 and
 then
 Hoodie
 just
 below
 147.


Tesla,
 wow,
 456
 on
 Tessy.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 update
 is
 on


Tesla.
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 a
 headline,


but


outside
 of
 the
 upgrades,
 uh,


Tesla
 is
 getting
 that
 breakup.


Deanna,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Happy
 birthday,
 dear
 MIT.
 You're
 a


national
 treasure.
 feel
 so
 lucky
 to
 be


part
 of
 this
 community
 you've
 built
 to


make
 a
 big
 wish.
 Deanna,
 thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 the
 love.
 I
 know
 you
 joined


recently
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 months.


Um,
 but
 deeply
 deeply
 appreciate
 you
 as


well
 and
 uh
 and
 being
 part
 of
 the
 show.


Okay,
 we
 still
 got
 like
 20
 more
 of
 these


to
 run
 through,
 folks.
 We
 got
 20
 more
 of


these
 to
 run
 through.
 I'm
 going
 to
 try


to
 run
 through
 them.
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 to


end
 it
 at
 12:00
 pm
 and
 uh
 get
 you
 guys


out
 of
 here
 and
 then
 we'll
 be
 back
 on


the


on
 the
 market
 close.
 I
 just
 really
 want


to
 get
 to
 everybody
 because
 I
 I
 deeply


do
 appreciate
 everyone
 taking
 the
 time


to
 to
 send
 it.
 Paul,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


gifted
 one
 membership.
 Uh
 Sanjie,
 thank


you
 for
 the
 $20
 super
 chat.
 Happy


birthday,
 mate.
 You're
 truly
 amazing
 and


incredibly
 hardworking.
 Thank
 you
 for


uniting
 this
 wonderful
 community
 and


putting
 all
 the
 effort
 you
 put
 up.
 Keep


up
 the
 fantastic
 work.
 Sanjief,
 thank


you
 as
 well
 for
 being
 here.
 There
 is
 no


community
 unless
 people
 show
 up
 and


people
 want
 to
 be
 part
 of
 it.
 So
 deeply


appreciate
 you
 being
 here
 as
 well.


Marvelous
 Dream,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super


chat.
 New
 investor
 started
 listening


this
 year
 during
 work.
 Learned
 a
 lot.


Happy
 birthday.
 First
 time
 super


chatting
 ever
 on
 YouTube.
 That's
 also


the
 cool
 thing.
 A
 lot
 of
 the
 the
 newer


investors
 that
 have
 just
 got
 into
 the


markets
 because
 of
 whatever
 reason
 got


them
 excited
 to
 think
 about
 stocks.
 Um


you
 know,
 this
 channel
 being
 the
 first


place
 they
 kind
 of
 find
 themselves
 into


and
 then
 the
 community
 being
 part
 of


something
 that
 they
 haven't
 been
 part
 of


before.
 That
 that's
 really
 cool.
 That's


you
 know,
 that's
 really
 really
 cool.


there's
 there
 there's
 not
 that
 many


other
 people
 doing
 a
 market
 open
 and


close
 every
 day
 and
 so
 um
 you
 know
 the


fact
 that
 we
 get
 to
 do
 it
 every
 day
 and


and
 get
 to
 have
 more
 people
 join
 it
 I


think
 it
 just
 makes
 it
 really
 really
 fun


every
 single
 day.
 Um
 David,
 thank
 you


for
 the
 $10
 super
 chat
 saying
 happy


birthday
 below.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 $55


super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday
 mate.
 Been


following
 you
 for
 years.
 Please
 buy
 a


BMR
 share
 on
 me.
 Please
 consider
 Seattle


for
 a
 meetup.
 Seattle
 is
 on
 the
 list.


I've
 been
 thinking
 about
 that
 one
 and
 I


will
 buy
 a
 share
 of
 BMR
 on
 you
 as
 well.


Thank
 you,
 VO,
 and
 thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 Broccoli,
 Broccoli
 Bob's
 been
 here


for
 a
 long
 time.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 gift


to
 10
 memberships.
 Broccoli,
 deeply,


deeply
 appreciate
 you
 being
 here
 for
 the


past
 couple
 years.
 Round,
 thank
 you
 for


the
 super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 M.


Thanks
 for
 all
 your
 DD
 on
 pounder
 and


hood.
 Round,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $20
 and


thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Shirona,


thanks
 for
 the
 $10
 super
 chat.
 Happy


birthday,
 Mitt.
 Been
 here
 since
 Hoodie


was
 11.
 Wow,


what
 a
 journey
 on
 Hoodie.
 What
 a
 journey


on
 Hoodie.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here
 and


thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Fallen,


thanks
 for
 the
 $10.
 Happy
 birthday,
 man.


Even
 though
 I
 work
 12
 night
 hour
 shifts


or
 12-h
 hour
 night
 shifts,
 I
 still


managed
 to
 watch
 most
 of
 the
 streams
 and


destroy
 my
 sleep.
 Glad
 I
 found
 you


through
 Joseph
 Carlson
 earlier
 this


year.
 Thank
 you
 for
 that.
 That
 really


means
 a
 lot
 to
 me.
 Again,
 being
 part
 of


people's
 days
 when
 they're
 at
 work,
 when


they're
 getting
 home,
 driving,
 all
 that


stuff.
 Um,
 man,
 it
 just
 it
 it
 just
 means


more
 than
 I
 can
 imagine.
 And
 yeah,


Joseph
 Carlson,
 I
 think
 he
 he
 he
 he


featured
 like
 one
 of
 my
 posts
 in
 a
 video


a
 couple
 months
 ago.
 and
 uh
 that's
 a
 lot


of
 his
 audience
 kind
 of
 found
 me
 through


that.
 So
 yeah,
 it
 means
 a
 lot.
 I
 mean
 I


I
 I
 I
 I
 have
 my
 own
 content
 creators


that
 I
 listen
 to
 throughout
 the
 day
 that


gets
 me
 through,
 you
 know,
 what
 I'm


doing
 throughout
 the
 day.
 And
 so
 it
 it


it
 does
 uh
 really
 mean
 a
 lot
 to
 be
 like


that
 for
 someone
 else.
 And
 I
 take
 that


very
 seriously
 and
 I,
 you
 know,
 try
 to


not
 undermine
 that
 position
 that
 I'm
 in


and
 uh
 try
 to
 make
 sure
 it's
 as
 valuable


as
 it
 can
 become.


So
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Uh


Conversad,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 10
 super


chat.
 Hey,
 a
 minute.
 Quit
 my
 job
 that
 I


have
 for
 20
 years
 uh
 to
 focus
 on
 doing


lives
 like
 you
 for
 the
 Portuguese


community
 starting
 in
 December.
 Thank


you
 so
 much
 for
 your
 content.
 Pound
 your


changes
 live.
 Wow.
 Uh
 definitely
 DM
 me


your
 link
 on
 Twitter.
 I
 will
 uh
 blast
 it


out
 to
 to
 anyone
 who
 is
 in
 the


Portuguese
 community.
 And
 dude,
 that's


incredible.
 That
 is
 absolutely


incredible.
 I
 think
 uh
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of


demand
 for
 stock
 market
 content
 in
 a


different
 language.


So
 uh
 whether
 it's
 Spanish,
 Portuguese,


I
 mean
 like
 Hindi,
 there's
 tons.


There's,
 you
 know,
 YouTube
 has
 2.6


billion
 people
 using
 it
 and
 not
 everyone


obviously
 speaks
 English.
 So
 there's


plenty
 of
 TAM
 and
 opportunity
 for
 people


doing
 the
 what
 I
 do
 in
 a
 different


language
 and
 and
 that's
 super
 awesome.


So
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here
 and
 uh
 let


me
 know
 when
 your
 channel
 launches.


Angela,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $28
 super


chat.
 Angela,
 I
 know
 you've
 been
 part
 of


the
 show
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 I
 think
 you're


part
 of
 Chris's
 Patreon
 if
 I'm
 not


wrong.
 So
 thank
 you.
 Uh,
 thank
 you
 for


being
 part
 of
 this
 entire
 community.


Thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Um,
 Tess,


thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Happy


Womb.


How
 do
 you
 say
 that
 word?
 Womb.


Womb,
 right?
 The
 womb.
 That's
 how
 you


say
 it,
 right?


How
 to
 say
 or
 is
 it
 wamp?
 No,
 it's
 not


womb.
 I'm
 being
 stupid.
 It's
 not
 wamp.


It's
 freaking
 womb.
 It
 better
 be
 womb,


bro.


>> Womb.


>> Okay,
 good.


I
 almost
 said
 one,
 bro.
 I
 almost
 said


happy
 womb
 evacuation
 day.
 Was
 going
 to


wait
 till
 tomorrow
 as
 per
 what
 you
 said


about
 your
 community
 giving
 on
 your


birthday,
 but
 you're
 in
 the midst
 of


loads
 and
 my
 community
 we
 give
 on


birthdays.
 So,
 just
 enjoy
 your
 gifts.


Thank
 you,
 Tess.


Appreciate
 it.
 Of
 course,
 your
 super


chat
 would
 be
 the
 comment
 that
 makes
 me


mess
 up
 the
 word
 because
 why
 not?


Tess
 has
 been
 trolling
 me
 on


pronunciation
 for
 two
 and
 a
 half
 years.


Dude,
 is
 it
 crazy
 to
 say?
 I
 thought
 it


was
 womb.
 Like
 I
 knew
 I
 heard
 the
 word


womb
 before,
 but
 I
 just
 wanted
 to


confirm
 with
 Gemini.
 That's
 why
 we


freaking
 buy
 Google
 stock,
 okay?
 Needed


to
 have
 a
 little bit
 of
 confirmation.


But
 thank
 you,
 Tess.
 Deeply,
 deeply


appreciate
 it.
 Tess
 has
 again
 been
 a
 big


supporter
 of
 the
 channel
 for
 the
 past


couple
 of
 years.
 She
 has
 crushed
 it


outside
 of
 pounder
 hood.
 For
 those
 that


don't
 know,
 and
 you
 guys
 probably
 know


by
 now,
 I
 mean,
 her
 name
 is
 literally


Quantess.
 This
 has
 been
 her
 baby
 D-Wave


right
 there
 for
 the
 past
 $35.
 I
 mean,


she
 was
 buying
 this
 thing
 below
 a


dollar.
 So,
 she
 is
 up
 more
 than
 35x.
 I


think
 in
 fact,
 she
 sold
 some
 recently
 to


buy
 a
 house.
 So,
 you
 know,
 she
 was
 able


to
 use
 those
 gains
 and
 really
 maximize


the
 potential
 of
 what
 she's
 been
 able
 to


do.
 And
 look,
 you
 know,
 I
 don't
 fully


agree
 on
 D-Wave's
 valuation,
 but
 that


doesn't
 mean
 that,
 you
 know,
 we
 can't


get
 along
 in
 this
 community.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 fair.
 You
 know,
 you
 can
 disagree


on
 certain
 names
 and
 certain
 ideas
 of


certain
 stocks.
 That's
 kind
 of
 what


makes
 a
 market
 to
 have
 one
 person
 agree,


one
 person
 disagree,
 but
 you
 can
 still


be
 friends.
 You
 can
 still
 cultivate
 a


meaningful
 community.
 And
 uh
 the
 two


names
 that
 we've
 both
 been
 a
 part
 of


Hood
 and
 Pounder
 have
 just
 been
 pretty


exceptional.
 She
 was
 also
 very
 early
 in


Hood
 and
 Paler
 as
 well.
 So
 yeah,
 she


said,
 "I
 sold
 10%
 for
 a
 new
 house."


That's
 kind
 of
 crazy,
 bro.
 Like


regardless
 of
 what
 you
 think
 of
 a
 stock


or
 its
 valuation,
 if
 you
 buy
 it
 at
 a
 one


and
 it
 goes
 to
 35,


I
 mean,
 and
 if
 it's
 probably
 not
 going


back
 to
 one,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 think


squarely
 shorting
 it
 is
 kind
 of
 stupid.


Um,
 you
 can
 disagree
 all
 you
 want
 with


how
 you
 think
 of
 the
 perception
 of
 the


company,
 but
 to
 be
 able
 to
 then
 sell
 10%


of
 a
 3500%
 move
 and
 buy
 a
 house,
 it's


pretty
 freaking
 cool.
 It's
 pretty


freaking
 cool.
 So,
 and
 a
 lot
 and
 you


know,
 there's
 a
 decent
 amount
 of
 you


that
 followed
 her
 into
 D-Wave.
 I
 mean,


not
 everyone
 here,
 but
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of


you
 guys
 have
 followed
 the
 quantum
 story


and
 you've
 done
 very
 well.
 You've
 done


very,
 very
 well
 as
 those
 names
 have


continued
 to
 get
 more
 catalyst.
 So,


there
 you
 go.
 Tess,
 thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 Also,
 for
 those
 that
 don't
 know,


Tess
 is
 a
 mod,
 right?
 And
 she
 was
 at
 the


the
 Miami
 meetup
 and
 uh
 she
 made
 sure


everyone
 was
 getting
 drunk
 and
 uh
 you


know,
 she
 took
 care
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 people.


So,
 deeply
 appreciate
 your
 support,


Tess.
 basically
 been
 like
 a
 motherly


figure
 to
 me
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 years


and
 I
 appreciate
 you
 being
 here
 in
 the


chat
 every
 single
 day.
 Sherees,
 thank


you
 for
 the
 $20
 super
 chat.
 Happy


birthday,
 Amit.
 You
 are
 the
 best.


Sherees,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here
 as


well.
 Ryan,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Aid,
 happy
 birthday.
 You
 should
 have


your
 show
 on
 YouTube
 TV.


I
 mean,
 technically
 you
 could
 watch
 it


on
 YouTube
 TV.
 Well,
 no,
 because
 YouTube


TV
 is
 live.
 Yeah,
 usually
 I
 mean
 it's


YouTube
 kind
 of
 functions
 as
 TV,
 but


it's
 not
 literally
 YouTube
 TV
 at
 that


you
 would
 have
 to
 join
 a
 network,
 which


I've
 said
 before
 in
 the
 past,
 I
 don't


think
 I'm
 ever
 going
 to
 join
 CNBC
 or


Bloomberg
 just
 because
 I
 have
 too
 much


fun
 doing
 it
 this
 way.
 You
 know,
 there


there
 might
 be
 more
 financial
 upside
 in


those
 opportunities,
 but
 it's
 just
 not


as
 authentic.
 It
 doesn't
 feel
 as
 fun
 and


like,
 you
 know,
 where
 are
 we
 going
 to


get
 the
 Grinder
 and
 Dentist
 jokes
 from


if
 we're
 on
 CNBC
 and
 Bloomberg,
 bro?


It's
 gonna
 be
 boring.
 Also,
 there's


going
 to
 be
 a
 teleprompter
 and
 you
 know,


your
 boy
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 read


any
 of
 the
 stupid
 names
 they
 put
 up
 on


the
 teleprompter.
 And
 then
 on
 live


television,
 I'm
 going
 to
 mess
 up.
 Like,


I
 can
 mess
 up
 in
 front
 of
 10,000.
 Do
 I


want
 to
 mess
 up
 in
 front
 of
 a
 100


thousand
 people
 by
 saying
 womb
 instead


of
 womb?
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 CNBC


would
 kick
 me
 off
 pretty
 easily
 if
 I
 uh


if
 I
 made
 that
 mistake.
 So,


in
 order
 for
 me
 to
 to
 to
 keep
 my
 ability


to
 even
 pronounce
 the
 way
 I
 pronounce,


I'm
 going
 to
 have
 to
 stay
 on
 YouTube.
 Uh


Mark,
 thanks
 for
 the
 $20
 super
 chat
 and


happy
 birthday
 mid.
 Here's
 the
 Q4.
 Let's


catch
 up
 in
 Europe.
 Hopefully,
 we
 will


get
 that
 Europe
 meet
 up
 going
 on
 and
 uh


appreciate
 you
 being
 here
 as
 well.
 Uh,


Lolo,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $20
 super
 chat.


When
 I
 was in
 vacay
 in
 Japan,
 it
 felt


weird
 without
 my
 daily
 emit
 meeting.


Thank
 you
 so
 much
 and
 happy
 birthday.


Lolo,
 thank
 you
 again.
 Yeah,
 it
 it
 felt


weird
 on
 Friday
 when
 I
 didn't
 go
 live


either.
 I
 mean,
 at
 this
 point,
 that's


why
 in
 September,
 I
 was
 so
 annoyed


because
 I
 was
 traveling
 so
 much
 and
 we


didn't
 have
 the
 consistent
 routine
 and


uh
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 I
 really
 care
 about


that
 routine
 and
 uh
 I
 want
 to
 keep
 that


routine.
 V-Wave
 right
 there, they're
 up


8%
 on
 the
 day.
 Tesla
 455,
 Nvidia
 191,


Palanteer
 is
 at
 190,
 and
 then
 you
 got


the
 Googs
 right
 here.
 Wow.
 267.
 Look
 at


that.
 Alltime
 high
 on
 Google.
 Officially


alltime
 high
 on
 Google,
 folks.
 S&P


breaking
 out
 above
 1%
 as
 well.


But
 yeah,
 I
 I
 need
 that
 routine
 every


day.
 And
 uh
 you
 know,
 the
 fact
 that


other
 people
 care
 about
 that
 routine,


that
 that
 also
 means
 a
 lot.
 Kyle,
 thanks


for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Appreciate
 you.
 Make


good
 work.
 Thanks
 a
 lot,
 man.
 Happy


birthday,
 iconic
 immigrant.
 Thank
 you


for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday
 to


the
 retail
 king.
 Please
 never
 change.
 Uh


never
 let
 the
 gains
 cloud
 your
 brains.


Appreciate
 that,
 sir.
 Thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 And
 uh
 yeah,
 deeply


appreciate
 you
 being
 part
 of
 the


community
 as
 well.
 Julie,
 thanks
 for
 the


$20
 super
 chat.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 Data
 monkey,
 thank
 you for
 the


super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 dude.
 Hope


all
 the
 super
 chats
 keep
 us
 here
 until


the
 close.
 Appreciate
 the
 work
 on
 Hood,


Nebius,
 and
 more.
 Sending
 love
 to
 you


via
 the
 channel.


Data
 monkey,


thank
 you
 for
 being
 here
 as
 well.


Congrats
 on
 the
 acquisition
 of
 Grinder.


Thank
 you
 guys.
 I
 I
 appreciate
 that
 as


well.


All
 right,
 guys.
 No
 more
 super
 chats.


I'm
 going
 to
 try
 to
 read
 the
 last
 10
 and


then
 that's
 it.
 We
 got
 I
 got
 to
 let
 you


guys
 leave.
 Like
 you
 guys
 have
 to
 leave.


I
 have
 to
 leave.
 We'll
 be
 back
 on
 the


close.


Oh
 my
 gosh.
 This
 is
 a
 lot.
 There's
 still


like
 another
 30
 of
 these
 left.
 Dude,
 I


said
 there
 was
 30
 left.
 30
 ago.


This
 is
 like


This
 is
 a
 lot,
 dude.
 I'm
 like
 I'm
 like


I'm
 kind
 of
 losing
 my
 voice
 here
 reading


oldies.


No,
 you're
 not
 allowed
 to
 leave.
 Oh
 my


goodness.
 I
 guess
 I'm
 not.
 We're
 going


to
 do
 the
 pictures
 on
 the
 clothes.
 We're


gonna
 do
 the
 pictures
 on
 the
 close.


And
 um


and
 yeah,
 we'll
 do
 that
 on
 the
 market


close.
 I
 almost
 called
 the
 NJ
 state


police
 on
 Friday
 to
 do
 a
 welfare
 check.


That
 would
 be
 funny
 if
 you
 call
 the


police.
 Be
 like,
 "Where's
 it?"
 They'd
 be


like, "We
 don't
 know."
 Like,
 "Well,
 he's


not
 live,
 so
 what's
 going
 on
 here?"
 Um


Chan,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $10
 super
 chat.


Happy
 birthday,
 Mit.
 Hope
 it's
 a
 good


one.
 Chan,
 appreciate
 you.
 B
 pill,
 thank


you
 for
 the
 $10
 super
 chat.
 Happy


birthday,
 Mid.
 Have
 a
 great
 day.
 But
 why


are
 you
 gay?
 That's
 hilarious.
 As
 for


that
 video
 we
 saw
 last
 week.
 Thank
 you


for
 being
 here.
 Uh
 search
 problem.
 Thank


you for
 the
 $5
 super
 chat.
 Happy


birthday,
 bro.
 Thanks
 to
 your
 calls.
 I'm


kicking
 off
 a
 healthier
 investing


journey.
 I'm
 breaking
 even
 so
 far
 after


following
 your
 insights.
 Absolutely


incredible.
 Thanks
 for
 being
 here.
 A
 lot


of
 us
 sometimes
 got
 to
 clean
 up
 some
 of


the
 junk
 in
 the
 portfolio.
 And
 you
 know,


that
 was
 me
 back
 in
 21.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a


lot
 of
 us.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 that's
 why


it's
 hard
 to
 get
 into
 some
 of the


specular
 names
 after
 you've
 been
 through


that
 phase.
 You
 kind
 of
 want
 to
 just


stay
 centered
 on
 fundamental
 companies.


So
 appreciate
 you
 being
 here
 as
 well.
 P


Mills,
 thanks
 for
 the
 $20
 super
 chat.


Been
 following
 your
 work
 since
 2021.


Help
 run
 your
 Facebook
 page,
 too.
 Happy


birthday,
 buddy.
 Keep
 up
 the
 great
 work.


P
 Mills,
 appreciate
 it.
 We
 have
 that


pounder
 Facebook
 page
 back
 in
 like
 22.


It
 was
 just
 like
 a
 pounder
 investor


group
 on
 Facebook.
 So,
 uh,
 yeah,
 I
 think


you
 know,
 most
 people
 don't
 use
 that


anymore,
 but
 those
 were
 the
 early
 days,


right?
 When
 the
 stock
 was
 six,
 seven


bucks
 and
 we
 all
 needed
 to
 connect


somehow
 and
 there
 wasn't
 this
 massive


YouTube
 community.
 We're
 like,
 all


right,
 who's
 on
 Facebook
 that
 cares


about
 Palier?
 And
 uh,
 and
 we
 set
 up
 that


group.
 So,
 super
 super
 awesome
 for
 you


being
 here


since
 those
 days
 and
 thanks
 for
 being


part
 of the
 channel.
 Mark,
 thanks
 for


the
 $10
 super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday,


Mitch.
 Started
 watching
 this
 year
 from


the
 beautiful
 city
 of
 Nottingham,
 UK.
 I


love
 it.
 I
 need
 to
 visit
 my
 Brits.
 I


have
 to
 go
 there
 hopefully.
 Hopefully,


that's
 the
 first
 part
 of
 the


international
 leg.
 I
 mean,
 I
 know
 London


is
 a
 is
 a
 big
 one
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people.


So,


we're
 gonna
 see
 what
 we
 can
 do
 and
 uh


hopefully
 we
 can
 make
 that
 happen.
 Omar,


thanks
 for
 the
 one
 uh
 gifted
 sub.


Appreciate
 you.
 Easy,
 thanks
 for
 the
 $10


super

 Happy
 birthday,

 I've


been

 for
 I've
 been
 with
 you
 for
 six


months
 and
 my

 have
 grown
 by


over
 40,000.
 Thank
 you.
 Incredible.


Congratulations
 on
 that.
 Very
 nice
 to


see.
 Uh

not
 the
 actual

 V,
 but
 a
 different


triple
 VX3.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.


Happy

 I
 wish

 And
 alltime

 today.


Pretty
 exciting
 to

 well.
 But
 um


yeah,
 it's
 been
 incredible.
 Just
 been
 an


absolutely


incredible
 ride.
 Alex,
 thanks
 for
 the


super

 Hey,
 I'm
 so
 glad
 I
 found
 you


back
 in
 2022.
 Thanks
 for
 everything
 you


do
 and
 happy
 birthday.
 How
 many
 super


chats
 left?
 Is
 this
 a
 record
 broken?
 I
 I


think
 it
 might
 be
 a
 record
 broken
 for
 a


financial
 YouTuber.
 There
 is
 148
 is
 what


I'm
 seeing.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 many
 we


have
 left,
 but


yeah,
 it
 might
 be
 that
 record.
 Thank
 you


for
 being
 here
 and
 thanks
 for
 being

Siege,
 thank
 you
 again
 for
 a
 $200
 super


chat.
 You
 do
 not
 need
 to
 send
 this


money.
 I
 would
 send
 $200
 a
 day
 until
 I


realize
 Triple
 V
 has
 got
 to
 be
 worse
 at


least
 10x
 than
 me.
 So,
 I
 dialed
 it
 back


to
 keep
 it
 in
 line.
 You've
 got
 an


amazing
 brain.
 Take
 care
 of
 it
 for
 us.


See,
 you're
 you're
 you're
 being
 too


kind.
 But
 you
 already
 sent
 the
 $20
 super


chat.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 $200
 super
 chat


again.
 Appreciate
 you
 as
 always.
 And
 uh


let's
 just
 say
 drinks
 on
 me.
 I
 know
 you


can
 drink.
 I
 know
 you
 can
 drink.
 So,


drinks
 on
 me
 next
 time
 uh
 next
 time


we're
 at
 a
 meet
 up.
 Uh
 on
 my
 Thank
 you


for
 the
 $2
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 Mid.


Watching
 your
 stream
 has
 become
 part
 of


my
 daily
 activities.
 Thank
 you
 and


keeping
 up
 for
 the
 work.
 I
 hope
 you
 keep


up
 with
 it.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 I


again
 it's
 deeply
 deeply
 gratifying
 to


know
 that
 it's
 part
 of
 people's
 daily


routines
 and
 hopefully
 it
 continues
 to


be
 a
 part
 of
 people's
 routines.
 Cheeky,


thanks
 for
 the
 40
 super
 chat
 for
 your


folks
 to
 admit
 they
 deserve
 the
 love.


Buy
 them
 a
 drink
 for
 raising
 an
 amazing


man.
 Happy
 birthday
 for
 all
 the
 best
 in


the
 year
 ahead.
 Your
 knowledge
 has
 truly


helped
 me
 as
 a
 newbie
 investor.


Thank
 you.
 I
 will
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 I
 will


make
 sure
 the
 uh
 the
 folks
 are
 taken


care
 of
 as
 well.
 Cheeky
 and
 thanks
 for


the
 super
 chat.
 One
 of
 the
 one
 of
 the


better
 parts
 of
 having
 a
 little
 bit
 more


financial
 freedom
 and
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


you
 guys
 in
 the
 chat
 have
 probably
 felt


this
 as
 well
 is
 just
 being
 able
 to
 take


care
 of
 some
 of
 your
 loved
 ones.
 So,
 you


know,
 like
 it
 I
 will
 randomly
 send
 my


mom
 money
 and
 I
 actually
 bought
 her
 an


iPad
 over
 the
 weekend
 because
 I
 bought


myself
 another
 iPad
 because
 I
 needed


another
 screen
 to
 kind
 of
 do
 a
 little


bit
 more
 of
 the
 work
 that
 I'm
 keeping
 up


with
 and
 so
 I
 know
 my
 mom's
 been
 talking


about
 an
 iPad
 so
 I
 bought
 her
 an
 iPad
 as


well.
 like
 just
 just
 having
 the
 ability


to
 be
 like,
 you
 know,
 you
 don't
 have
 to


stress
 too
 much
 about
 buying
 your
 loved


ones
 a
 gift,
 you
 know,
 it
 is
 it
 is
 the


most
 rewarding
 part
 of
 uh
 being
 in
 the


stock
 market
 and
 actually
 being
 able
 to


accelerate
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 because


you
 have
 the
 ability
 to,
 you
 know,
 help


other
 people.
 So
 deeply
 deeply
 deeply


means
 a
 lot
 and
 you
 know
 everyone
 that's


been
 the
 most
 rewarding
 part
 of


being
 able
 to
 even
 be
 part
 of
 the


charie.
 Joe,
 thanks
 for
 the
 $20
 super

 Happy
 birthday,
 Mid.

Thanks
 for
 the
 $5
 super
 chat.
 Admit
 it.


It's
 weird
 to
 say
 this
 to
 a
 stranger,


but
 I'm
 proud
 of
 you
 and
 I'm
 also
 so


grateful
 to
 be
 here.
 Wish
 I
 found
 you


earlier,
 but
 I
 tune
 in
 every
 day
 now.


First
 trillionaire.
 First
 of
 all,
 I'm


proud
 to
 know
 you
 as
 well
 because
 if


you're
 actually
 going
 to
 be
 the
 first


trillionaire,
 then
 I
 would
 love
 that


they're
 in
 my
 chat.
 That
 would
 be


incredible.
 And
 yeah,
 man.
 I
 appreciate


you
 being
 here
 every
 day.
 the
 fact
 that


you're,
 you
 know,
 tuning
 in
 multiple

 Happy


birthday.
 I
 know
 you
 since
 2022.
 You


don't
 know
 me,
 but
 we
 have
 had
 some


exchanges.
 Ken
 means
 a
 lot.
 Um,
 there's


another
 person
 named
 Ken.
 Ken
 Bahori
 if


he's
 watching
 and
 uh
 he
 initially
 sent


me
 one
 of
 the
 first
 pieces
 of
 Palanteer


paraphernalia
 that
 I've
 had
 uh
 ever
 and


it's
 this
 like
 metal
 logo
 of
 Palanteer.


So
 uh
 yeah
 I
 mean
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 from


that
 2022
 time
 frame
 that
 have
 kept
 up


with
 the
 channel
 and
 it
 means
 a
 lot.
 So


thank
 you
 Ken
 for
 being
 here.
 Chili
 dog,


thanks
 for
 the
 $10
 super
 chat.
 Happy


birthday
 mid.
 I'm
 here
 daily
 and


appreciate
 you.
 Freedom
 Nick,
 thanks
 for


the
 $10
 super
 chat.
 You
 have
 been
 a


blessing
 during
 the
 stress
 of
 this


market.
 Thank
 you
 for
 your
 joy.
 Freedom


Nick,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here
 as
 well.


Again,
 on
 the
 good
 days
 or
 the
 bad
 days,


we
 all
 got
 to
 be
 here
 and
 uh
 try
 to


analyze
 everything
 that
 is
 going
 down


and
 going
 down.
 And
 you
 know,
 on
 the
 bad


days,
 sometimes,
 you
 know,
 there's
 a


little
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 necessity
 to
 have
 a


bit
 of
 a
 community
 versus
 on
 the
 good


days.
 Yeti,
 thanks
 for
 the
 $28
 super


chat.
 Longtime
 listener,
 thank
 you
 for


everything,
 myth.
 Yeti,
 thanks
 for
 being


here.
 Daffany,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $100


super
 chat.
 Deeply
 appreciate
 it.
 You


didn't
 write
 anything
 in
 the
 super
 chat,


but
 thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 being
 here
 and
 thank
 you
 for


the
 $100
 super
 chat.
 Nikita,
 thanks
 for


the
 10
 bucks.
 Hi
 Mit,
 I'm
 new
 to


investing
 and
 I've
 been
 listening
 to
 you


for
 a
 few
 weeks
 now.
 Thanks
 for
 all
 your


guidance.
 Happy
 birthday.
 Hope
 you
 have


a
 meet
 up
 in
 New
 York
 City
 sometime


soon.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 we
 will
 be
 doing
 it


in
 January.
 I'm
 having
 a
 meeting
 with
 uh


the
 new
 agency
 I
 was
 working
 with
 on


Saturday.
 So,
 uh
 yes,
 I
 think
 New
 York


City
 is
 definitely
 happening.
 Don't
 know


exactly
 the
 date,
 probably
 towards
 the


end
 of
 January,
 but
 it
 looks
 like
 we're


going
 to
 get
 the
 ball
 rolling
 on
 that


and
 that
 should
 be
 very
 fun.


And
 uh
 it'll
 be
 another
 chance
 to
 meet
 a


bunch
 more
 people.
 So,
 thank
 you
 Nikita


for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Dimmitri,
 thank
 you


for
 the
 $100.
 Happy
 birthday,
 Mid.
 I've


been
 watching
 you
 from
 February
 25
 and


during
 the
 crisis
 in
 April
 when
 I
 was


heavily
 invested
 in
 Nvidia.
 Your


reasoning
 and
 positive
 thinking
 helped


me
 to
 keep
 my
 peace
 of
 mind.
 I
 made
 a


lot of
 money.
 Cheers
 from
 Greece.


Dimmitri,
 thanks
 for
 being
 here.
 know


ironically
 deepseek
 and
 the
 collapse
 in


April
 was
 how
 I
 established
 my
 Nvidia


position
 as
 well.
 Um
 you
 know
 my
 average


is
 now
 122
 and
 you
 kind
 of
 needed


deepseek
 and
 then
 the
 onslaught
 of
 the


tariffs
 to
 really
 give
 us
 the
 prices


that
 was
 needed
 to
 develop
 a
 real


position.
 So
 um
 you
 know
 as
 I
 as
 I
 was


dcaing
 and
 as
 all
 of
 us
 were
 trying
 to


reconcile
 and
 and
 deal
 with
 the
 the


volatility
 of
 the
 of
 the
 markets
 retail


as
 a
 whole
 kind
 of
 took
 advantage
 of
 the


of
 the
 situation.
 Hopefully
 the
 stream


was
 a
 good
 spot
 for
 everyone
 to
 to
 kind


of
 convene
 and
 just
 be
 able
 to
 talk


about
 what's
 happening
 and
 ultimately
 I


think
 most
 of
 us
 concluded
 it's
 it's
 a


buy
 and
 it's
 worked
 out
 really
 well
 for


us.
 So
 thank
 you
 Dmitri,
 thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 Avis,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $11


super
 chat.
 Jake,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $10


super
 chat
 and
 making
 fun
 of
 how
 I
 say


womb.


It
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 Would
 appreciate
 you


being
 here.
 Amitz
 Dentist,
 thank
 you


again
 for
 a
 $20
 super
 chat.
 Call
 me.


It's
 just
 about
 the
 copay
 nothing
 else.


Oh
 my
 goodness,
 dude.
 Oh
 my
 goodness.


This
 this
 dentist
 thing
 is
 has
 taken


quite
 the
 life
 of
 its
 own.
 All right,


we're
 getting
 towards
 the
 end.
 We're


getting
 towards
 the
 end
 and
 then
 I
 think


we'll
 be
 done.
 Grumpy
 Bunny,
 thank
 you


for
 being
 a
 channel
 member.
 Happy


birthday,
 Mitt.
 Enjoy
 and
 take
 care
 of


yourself.
 You'll
 be
 surprised
 how


quickly
 the
 next
 28
 years
 go.
 Been
 here


since
 Pounder
 at
 7.
 Grumpy
 Bunny,
 thank


you
 for
 being
 here.
 I,
 you
 know,
 as
 I


get
 older,
 life
 is
 moving
 faster.
 I've


said
 this
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 months.
 I


felt
 that
 life
 is
 moving
 much
 faster
 and


I
 don't
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 slow
 down.


So,
 taking
 the
 moments
 to
 sit
 and
 just


uh
 uh
 you
 know
 uh
 sort
 of
 reflect
 I


guess
 is
 the
 best
 way
 to
 frame
 it
 on


what
 has
 happened
 over
 the
 past
 couple


years.
 It
 it
 really
 does
 mean
 a
 lot.
 And


so,
 yeah,
 I
 appreciate
 you
 being
 here.


Appreciate
 this
 whole
 community.
 And
 I


think
 the
 reflecting
 of
 that
 stuff
 is


very
 important
 on
 days
 like
 this.
 Uh


Fryjack,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Happy
 birthday,
 M.
 said
 you
 wanted
 to


give
 back
 to
 the
 community,
 but
 we're


the
 ones
 who
 got
 to
 give
 back
 to
 you.


Uh,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 next
 two
 words


say.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 in
 a
 different


language.
 I
 definitely
 cannot
 say
 that.


Wistiago
 nailgo.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 hell
 that
 means.


It's
 got
 to
 be
 a
 different
 language,
 but


thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Dude,
 I
 kind


of
 want
 to
 look
 that
 up
 now.
 What
 is


that?
 WSZ


Y


T
 K
 I
 E
 G
 O


Naj


Oh,
 this
 is
 a
 song.


This
 is
 a
 Polish
 song.


Okay,
 I'm
 gonna
 listen
 to
 this
 today.


Oh,
 it's
 happy
 birthday
 in
 Polish.
 Oh


[ __ ]


because
 well
 say
 happy
 birthday
 song.


Okay,
 got
 it.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for


the
 happy
 birthday
 in
 Polish.
 I'm
 gonna


listen
 to
 that
 song
 though.
 A
 song
 on


YouTube
 popped
 up.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to


listen
 to
 this
 later.
 All
 right,
 there


you
 go.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you


for
 being
 here.
 Ken,
 thanks
 for
 the
 $10


chat.
 After
 I
 was
 let
 go
 in
 July,
 I


learned
 how
 to
 sell
 calls
 and
 puts


thanks
 to
 your
 options
 101.
 I
 still
 look


for
 a
 job
 and
 now
 I'm
 making
 2x
 what
 I


used
 to
 make.
 So,
 I
 got
 something
 to
 go


with.
 Wow.
 Congratulations,
 Argato.


Thank
 you,
 Ken,
 for
 being
 here.
 I
 I
 do


think
 option
 selling
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 a


life
 hack
 uh
 if
 you
 can
 do
 it


productively.
 And
 so,
 yeah,
 I
 mean,


there
 there's
 a
 couple
 other
 people
 who


reached
 out
 to
 me
 that
 said
 they
 lost


their
 job
 over
 the
 past
 few
 months
 just


given
 the
 un
 uneasiness
 of
 the
 labor


market
 and
 and
 they
 they
 look
 to
 option


selling
 with
 some
 of
 the
 collateral
 they


had.
 And,
 you
 know,
 even
 if
 you
 have
 50


grand,
 100
 grand,
 even
 25
 grand,
 there


is
 a
 way
 to
 generate
 some
 yield
 in
 a
 way


that
 that
 also
 mitigates
 some
 risk.
 So,


deeply
 appreciate
 you
 being
 here
 and


hopefully
 that
 options
 101
 has
 helped
 a


lot
 of
 people.
 Susan,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


$50
 super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday.
 There's


a
 lot
 of
 us
 following
 from
 United
 Flight


Attendants
 and
 Pilots.
 Wow.


That
 is
 awesome.
 Thank
 you,
 Susan,
 for


uh
 for
 being
 here.


Uh
 United,
 United
 is
 the
 airline
 of


choice,
 so
 I
 guess
 you
 get
 pretty
 happy


every
 time
 I
 mention
 I'm
 on
 a
 United


flight.
 Um
 super
 dope.
 Super
 super super


dope.
 I
 I
 love
 United.
 I've
 been
 flying


with
 them
 basically
 for
 the
 past
 10


years
 now.
 So,
 uh
 deep
 appreciation
 for


any
 of
 the
 United
 flight
 attendants
 and


pilots
 who
 keep
 up
 with
 the
 channel.


Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 being


here,
 Susan.
 And
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 word


of
 mouth
 on
 the
 channel.
 Christopher,


thanks
 for
 the
 $20
 super
 chat.
 Happy

 Thank

you

 Chris,
 thanks
 for
 being

 you

 super
 chat
 and


being
 here.
 Mark,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super


chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 Mitt.
 Appreciate


you
 and
 the
 community
 you've
 built.


Hopefully
 catch
 you
 in
 the
 UK
 at
 some


point.
 Hopefully,
 we
 will
 be
 in
 the
 UK


and
 uh
 we'll
 be
 excited
 to
 be
 here.
 I'm


Benny.
 Thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Call


Steve.
 I
 think
 we'll
 call
 Steve
 on
 the


close.
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 him
 in
 the


morning.
 I
 know
 he's
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of


a
 busier
 Monday
 with
 meetings,
 but


we'll
 definitely
 uh
 give
 him
 a
 call


later
 and
 we'll
 talk
 to
 him.
 Dad


thoughts,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Was
 sold
 on
 you
 after
 the
 story
 about


the
 Scarface
 jacket.
 Been
 a
 pleasure
 to


witness
 your
 journey
 and
 see
 your


channel
 grow.
 My
 kids
 know
 you
 as
 our


drive
 time
 DJ.


The
 growth
 is
 due
 to
 your
 great


character.
 Happy
 birthday,


Dad
 Thoughts.
 Appreciate
 you.
 Um,
 you


know,
 the
 the
 other
 the
 other
 cool
 uh


cool
 element
 about
 this
 whole
 journey
 is


is
 is
 the
 the
 kids
 that
 have
 been,
 you


know,
 part
 of
 it
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 you


guys
 are
 older
 and
 you
 have
 kids,
 right?


S&P,
 by
 the
 way,
 new
 all-time
 high
 on


the
 day
 continuing
 to
 move
 and
 um


and
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 fact
 that
 you


know
 your
 kids
 are
 listening,
 I
 take


that
 very
 seriously,
 you
 know,
 because
 I


I
 do
 want
 to
 be
 a
 good
 influence
 on
 them


and
 uh
 you
 know,
 it
 means
 a
 lot.
 It's


definitely
 added
 a
 level
 of


responsibility
 when
 I'm
 speaking
 and
 and


interacting
 with
 everybody.
 So,
 I
 I


really
 do
 appreciate
 those
 that
 have
 let


me
 into
 their
 homes
 and
 be
 part
 of
 their


families
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 you
 know,
 it
 just


it
 just
 means
 a
 lot
 because
 those
 kids


are
 growing
 up
 and
 you
 know,
 they're


consuming
 this
 content
 even
 subliminally


and
 potentially
 that's
 attracting
 them


to
 to
 be
 more
 interested
 in
 the
 markets.


And
 you
 never
 know,
 maybe
 it
 could
 be


the
 catalyst
 that
 gets
 them
 to
 really


start
 investing
 seriously.
 I
 think
 all


of
 us
 have
 realized,
 you
 know,
 when
 you


get
 into
 the
 investing,
 when
 you
 get
 the


investing
 bug,
 it's
 hard
 to
 get
 out
 of


it
 and
 it
 really
 can
 change
 your
 life.


So,


really
 nice
 for
 for
 people
 at
 a
 younger


age
 to
 um
 to
 be
 dealing
 with
 that
 as


well.
 Rio,
 thank
 you for
 the
 $20
 shad.


Happy
 birthday,
 Emit.
 We
 can
 all
 win


together.
 Aloha.
 Have
 a
 blessed
 day.


Rio,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 And
 yes,


we
 all
 can
 win
 together.
 Thank
 you
 for


being
 part
 of
 the
 community.
 Paul,
 thank


you
 for
 the
 $100.
 Happy
 birthday,

Been
 a
 fun
 ride.
 Keep
 it
 up,

 appreciate

 much
 so


far.
 Greetings

Bosnia,
 another

 day.
 So,

House

 Darth,
 thanks
 for


the
 $20
 super
 chat.
 Hi,
 Mid.
 Happy


birthday.
 I'm
 about
 to
 retire
 at
 the
 age


of
 40.
 Wow.
 Big
 part
 because
 of
 you.
 Big


been
 here
 since
 the
 Tom
 Nash
 days.


Appreciated
 you,
 Jarth.
 That
 means
 a


lot,
 man.
 And
 congrats
 on
 retirement
 at


at
 40.
 That
 is
 uh
 that
 is
 not
 easy
 to


do.
 Not
 easy
 to
 do
 at
 all.
 And
 you
 know


those
 early
 days
 2021
 2022
 lots
 of


different
 shows
 and
 videos
 and
 all
 these


different
 concepts
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 people


you
 know
 there
 weren't
 as
 many
 people


watching
 but
 the
 people
 that
 were


watching
 I
 think
 were
 really
 drawn
 to


those
 different
 shows
 and
 you
 know
 I


remember
 I
 used
 to
 host
 the
 show
 with


Tom
 and
 Justin
 like
 all
 this
 this
 whole


journey
 has
 just
 been
 kind
 of
 crazy
 and


it's
 resulted
 in
 what
 we
 have
 today.
 So


appreciate
 you
 being
 here
 since
 then
 and


congrats


on
 the
 retirement
 as
 well.
 All
 right
 we


got
 like
 six
 left.
 We
 got
 like
 six
 left.


We're
 going
 to
 get
 through
 it.
 George


Feliz
 Complanos,
 that
 means
 happy


birthday
 in
 Spanish.
 I
 remember
 that


much
 from
 Mr.
 Garcia
 back
 in
 10th
 grade.


When
 are
 you
 visiting
 Puerto
 Rico?
 I'll


like
 to
 be
 here.
 Hopefully
 Puerto
 Rico


soon,
 but
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $5
 super


chat.
 I've
 actually
 never
 been.
 I
 think


no,
 maybe
 I've
 been
 once,
 like
 10,
 15


years
 ago,
 but
 I
 definitely
 would
 like


to
 visit
 Puerto
 Rico.
 I
 have
 a
 couple


friends
 that
 are
 there
 and
 it
 would
 be


super
 fun.
 So,
 if
 I
 do
 go,
 I
 will
 let


everyone
 know.
 Felix,
 thanks
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 M.
 Thanks


for
 everything.
 I'm
 25
 and
 I
 started


walking
 watching
 back
 in
 March.
 I'm


trying
 to
 watch
 every
 stream.
 Made
 good


money.
 Still
 below
 100,000,
 but


hopefully
 spring
 2026.


Best
 from
 Switzerland.
 Felix,
 thank
 you


for
 being
 here.
 Deeply
 appreciate
 you.


And
 um
 you
 know
 that
 first
 100K
 is
 hard,


but
 also
 that
 first
 100K
 once
 you
 get


there,
 you
 kind
 of
 feel
 unstoppable,


right?
 Because
 so
 many
 people
 have
 have


have
 not
 been
 able
 to
 just
 even
 get


forget
 100,000,
 but
 10,000
 in
 savings.


And
 so
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 that
 are
 just


focused
 on
 those
 milestones,
 making
 sure


that
 we're
 aggressive
 with
 with
 holding


ourselves
 accountable
 to
 being
 able
 to


save
 or
 invest
 or
 compound
 to
 get
 to


those
 milestones
 really
 means
 a
 lot


because
 then
 then
 you
 start
 to
 say,


okay,
 if
 I
 can
 get
 to
 100,
 I
 can
 get
 to


a
 million.
 If
 I
 can
 get
 to
 a
 million,
 I


can
 get
 to
 five
 million.
 You
 know,
 if
 I


can
 really
 get
 these
 milestones,
 then
 I


can
 keep
 this
 going.
 And
 I
 think
 the


whole
 journey
 of
 life
 is
 how
 can
 you


keep
 going?
 How
 can
 you
 keep


progressing?
 Life
 gets
 kind
 of
 boring


when
 you
 hit
 a
 ceiling.
 And
 so,
 you


know,
 very
 important
 no
 matter
 what
 part


of
 the
 journey
 to
 to
 keep
 that
 journey


going.
 Uh,
 Fem
 TV,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


five
 super
 chat.
 Not
 much,
 but
 go
 get


yourself
 some
 mayonnaise,
 please.
 That's


the
 one
 thing
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be
 eating


today
 for
 my
 birthday.
 Probably
 not


mayonnaise.


Probably
 not
 that,
 but
 thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 Rishi
 Patel,
 thanks
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 M.
 I
 started


watching
 this
 year.
 You
 in
 inspired
 me


to
 start
 a
 YouTube
 channel
 and
 an


options
 from
 actuarial
 studies.
 I
 love


your
 mentorship.
 Thanks
 for
 being


genuine
 and
 trustworthy.
 Cheers
 from


London,
 Relle.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.


You
 know,
 an
 actuary
 is
 actually
 one
 of


the
 jobs
 my
 mom
 wanted
 me
 to
 look
 into


back
 when
 I
 was
 in
 high
 school
 and
 uh
 I


didn't
 end
 up
 going
 that
 route,
 but
 I


have
 a
 lot
 of
 respect
 for
 those
 that


work
 as
 actuaries.
 It's
 not
 the
 easiest


job
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 so
 uh
 options
 and


derivatives
 should
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


simple
 simpler
 segue
 because
 you're


dealing
 with
 numbers
 already
 so
 much,


but
 I
 think
 it
 does
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.


And
 congrats
 on
 the
 YouTube
 channel.
 So,


thank
 you
 Michelle


for
 being
 here
 as
 well.
 Promote,
 thank


you
 for
 becoming
 a
 channel
 member.
 CR,


thanks
 for
 the
 $10
 super
 chat.
 Derek,


thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 admit
 I've


said
 this
 before,
 but
 it's
 a
 really
 cool


thing
 having
 a
 group
 that
 chat
 stocks
 or


my
 other
 friends
 don't
 know
 stocks
 or


don't
 care.
 I
 agree
 and
 that's
 why
 the


sub
 communities
 that
 have
 been
 created


from
 this
 entire
 chat
 uh
 are
 really


special
 because
 you
 know
 whether
 it's


group
 chats
 about
 tech
 or
 group
 chats


about
 macro
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 have


formed
 your
 own
 group
 chats
 and


privately
 messaged
 each
 other
 and
 now


you
 have
 some
 strangers
 across
 the
 world


that
 you're
 friends
 with
 that
 you
 can


talk
 to
 even
 if
 your
 buddies
 don't
 care


about
 what's
 happening
 with
 Nvidia.
 So


yeah,
 I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 that
 the
 the the


the
 subgroups
 out
 of
 the
 broader
 chat


have
 created
 so
 many
 more
 opportunities


for
 people
 and
 you
 know
 that
 that's


important
 when
 a
 lot
 of
 your
 friends
 and


family
 might
 not
 care
 about
 it.
 Uh


Cheese
 Head,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $28
 super


chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 man.
 Thanks
 for


providing
 value
 to
 the
 world.
 Thank
 you


for
 being
 here.
 Thank
 you
 for
 that


cheese
 head.
 Sauce
 Head,
 happy
 birthday.


Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here
 as
 well.


Justin,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $500
 super


chat.


You
 guys
 are
 really,
 really
 too
 kind


today.
 Deeply,
 deeply
 appreciated,


Justin.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.
 And
 happy


birthday.
 Keep
 it
 up.
 Again,
 guys,


that's
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 You
 do
 not
 need


to
 be
 spending
 that
 much
 money.
 Uh,
 but


I
 I
 very
 very
 very
 much
 appreciate
 it.


And
 thank
 you,
 Justin,
 for
 the
 $500


super
 chat.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 I


know
 I
 don't
 really
 monetize
 the


channel.
 I
 don't
 charge
 like


subscriptions.
 I
 don't
 do
 private


Discord,
 all
 that
 stuff.
 Uh,
 which
 is


why
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 are
 compelled


sometimes
 to
 just
 send
 your
 support


through
 a
 super
 chat,
 but
 genuinely
 I
 I


I
 just
 I
 really
 am
 doing
 it
 for
 the
 love


of
 the
 game.
 I'm
 happy
 that
 you
 guys
 are


here.
 That's
 it.
 I
 know
 it
 sounds


cliche,
 but
 like


I
 was
 doing
 this
 when
 there
 was
 no
 money


involved
 in
 it.
 So,
 it's
 like,
 you
 know,


the
 money
 is
 just
 an
 added
 bonus,
 but


being
 able
 to
 get
 to
 do
 it
 every
 day.


It's
 like
 happiness.
 It's
 very
 few


people
 get
 to
 do
 what
 they
 want
 to
 do


every
 single
 day
 and
 be
 happy
 at
 it.


And,
 you
 know,
 I
 get
 to
 do
 that
 every


day.
 So,
 thank
 you,
 Justin.
 Thank
 you.


Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 $500
 super


chat.
 Means
 a
 lot.


And
 thanks
 for
 being
 here.
 Amit,
 just


kidding.
 My
 birthday
 is
 next
 week,
 dude.


That
 That
 would
 be
 funny.
 That
 would
 be


funny.
 Just
 kidding,
 guys.
 My
 birthday's


next
 week.


No,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 like
 finally
 it's


my
 birthday
 after
 all
 the
 birthday


wishes
 for
 the
 past
 two
 years.


We
 finally
 have
 the
 uh
 official


birthday.
 Viper,
 thanks
 for
 the
 $20


chat.
 Hi,

 Newer

California.

 lean
 in
 my
 golden
 years.

 to
 meet.

 definitely


across
 the
 pond
 would
 love
 to
 go
 and


travel.
 So,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 We


got
 two
 left,
 folks.
 Two
 left.
 Jamie


Lynn,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $20
 super
 chat.


Aid,
 happy
 birthday
 to
 the
 goat.
 you
 in


this
 community
 have
 changed
 my
 life.
 I


recently
 reached
 a
 sevenf
 figureure


club.
 Congratulations.
 I
 couldn't
 have


done
 it
 without
 you.
 You
 have
 truly


changed
 my
 life.
 Jamie
 means
 the


absolute
 world.
 Uh
 you
 have
 changed
 my


life
 by
 consuming
 the
 content
 every


single
 day.
 And
 hopefully
 the
 content's


value
 in
 the
 chat
 and
 the
 community
 have


been
 enough
 to
 change
 your
 life
 as
 well


financially.
 So
 appreciate
 you
 Jamie
 and


thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Uh
 metal
 god


2030,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $50
 super
 chat.


Happy
 birthday
 mid.
 Hope
 you
 have
 a


wonderful
 day.
 Thanks
 to
 you
 I
 learned


about
 pounder
 and
 a
 lot
 about
 the


market.
 Again,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here,


metal
 god,
 and
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 part


of
 the
 channel.
 Idris,
 thanks
 for
 the


$10
 chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 Amit.
 Thanks


for
 everything
 you've
 done.
 Greater


heights
 await
 you
 see
 once
 you're
 in


Singapore.
 Looking
 forward
 to
 being
 to


Singapore,
 hopefully
 in
 July
 of
 next


year.


Thank
 you
 for
 being
 part
 of
 the
 channel.


And
 then
 Jake,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 25
 $25


shipp.
 Thanks
 for
 making
 my
 daily


morning
 drive
 enjoyable.
 Happy
 birthday.


Thank
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here
 every
 day


while
 you're
 on
 that
 daily
 drive
 and
 uh


allowing
 me
 to
 enter
 your
 world.
 Okay,


the
 last
 one.
 That's
 it.


We
 are
 done.
 Last
 one.
 Please
 do
 not


send
 any
 more.
 I
 I
 legit
 cannot
 stay


live
 any
 longer.
 But
 Guy
 from
 the
 UK,


thank
 you
 for
 the
 10
 super
 chat.


I
 think
 we
 legit
 spent
 an
 hour
 reading


super
 chats,
 too.
 We
 had
 180
 super


chats.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you


everybody.
 Again,


you
 know,
 it's
 so
 counterintuitive


because
 you're
 like,
 "Stop
 sending
 me


money."
 When
 in
 reality,
 someone
 would


be
 like, "Oh,
 great.
 Let
 me
 milk
 this.


I'm
 making,
 you
 know,
 making
 tons
 of


money
 right
 here."
 But
 like
 first
 of
 all


I
 feel
 bad
 that
 people
 are
 sending
 my
 on


my
 birthday
 I
 should
 be
 giving
 back
 not


you
 guys
 give
 to
 me
 that's
 just
 how
 I've


always
 felt
 about
 you
 know
 a
 special
 day


uh
 like
 a
 birthday
 and
 number
 two
 it's


like
 you
 you
 know
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 send


the
 super
 chats
 like
 the
 fact
 that
 you


guys
 are
 here
 every
 day
 that
 is
 more


than
 enough
 it
 is
 not
 really
 is
 not


about
 the
 money
 it
 is
 about
 the
 fact


that
 people
 care


and
 I
 just
 think
 we're
 building


something
 special
 dude
 I
 really
 do
 think


we're
 building
 something
 special
 I
 think


in
 the
 next
 10
 years
 this
 could
 be
 even


bigger
 than
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 people


imagine.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 no
 heights
 to


where
 this
 can
 go,
 but
 to
 build
 anything


real,
 again,
 going
 back
 to
 Pounder,
 to


build
 anything
 real,
 you've
 got
 to
 build


it
 with
 the
 intent
 of
 not
 worrying
 about


sucking
 the
 life
 and
 the
 money
 out
 of


the
 customer
 or
 the
 community,
 but


building
 something
 so
 authentic
 that
 the


money
 will
 eventually
 find
 you.
 But


like,
 are
 you
 building?
 And
 that's
 what


Paler
 did
 for
 20
 years.
 They
 built


something
 very
 real
 and
 now
 they're


getting
 rewarded
 for
 it.
 But
 it
 took


time
 to
 go
 through
 all
 that
 [ __ ]
 to


build
 it
 and
 to
 not
 take
 the
 easy
 way


out.
 And
 and
 that's
 that's
 the
 approach


that
 I'm
 having
 here.


That
 is
 the
 goal.
 And
 uh


you
 know
 the
 fact
 that
 people
 care
 so


much
 it
 uh
 it
 is
 it
 is
 it
 is
 deeply


humbling.


It's
 deeply
 deeply
 humbling.
 Google's


making
 Yeah.
 Buy
 some
 Google
 stock
 bro.


I
 mean
 today
 is
 going
 to
 feed
 Google's


next
 quarter's
 EPS
 by
 God
 knows
 how


much.
 Google
 right
 there
 alltime
 high
 is


267.


Uh
 pounder
 just
 under
 190.
 S&P
 683


on
 the
 day
 as
 well.
 Jav,
 thank
 you
 for


the
 $50
 super
 chat.
 Jake,
 thanks
 for
 the


$10.
 Dollar
 Dash,
 thank
 you
 as
 well.
 I


found
 you
 two
 months
 ago.
 Best
 thing
 I


did
 listening
 to
 you
 every
 morning
 on


PST
 and
 every
 market
 close.
 Wow,
 that's


early.
 That's
 5:45.


So,
 appreciate
 everyone
 from
 the
 West


Coast.
 Appreciate
 everyone
 across
 the


world
 that
 has
 to
 get
 up
 at
 a
 weird
 time


to
 watch
 this
 stuff.
 Spencer,
 thanks
 for


the
 super
 chat.
 Blaine,
 thank
 you.


Robert,
 thank
 you.


Yeah.
 And
 all
 you
 guys,
 it
 uh


it
 really
 means
 a
 lot,
 guys.
 I
 I
 I
 don't


I
 don't
 know
 what
 else
 to
 say.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 else
 to
 say.
 I
 didn't


I
 didn't
 know
 that
 I
 would
 uh


that
 I
 would
 end
 up
 in
 this
 position
 in


life.
 And
 I'm
 trying
 to
 trying
 to
 make


sure
 that
 this
 position
 is
 is
 is


something
 that
 that
 really
 is
 not
 uh
 is


not
 taken
 for
 granted,
 I
 guess,
 is
 the


biggest
 thing.


Don't
 want
 to
 take
 it
 for
 granted
 at


all.
 So


yeah,
 man.
 It
 means
 a
 lot.
 Means
 a
 lot.


28
 years
 old,
 reflecting
 on
 life,


getting
 older.
 It's
 important
 to
 uh
 I


think
 take
 a
 moment
 to
 just
 just
 look


back
 and
 and
 see,
 you
 know,
 how
 how
 life


is
 progressing.
 We
 only
 get
 one
 of
 them


and
 then
 we're
 gone.
 And
 uh
 that
 is
 the


inevitability
 of
 life
 that,
 you
 know,
 I


I
 don't
 speak
 about
 it
 as
 much.
 I
 mean,


I
 used
 to
 speak
 about
 this
 a
 little
 bit


more
 back
 in
 2022
 for
 those
 that
 used
 to


listen
 to
 the
 late
 night
 stock
 talks


that
 we
 used
 to
 do,
 but
 uh,
 you
 know,


mortality
 has
 definitely
 been
 something


that
 has
 been
 on
 my
 mind
 realistically


since
 I've
 been
 20
 years
 old.
 I
 mean,
 I


I've
 studied
 a
 lot
 of
 philosophy
 that


has
 to
 do
 with
 existentialism
 and
 what


it
 means
 to
 even
 be
 alive
 and
 how
 do
 you


want
 to
 conceptualize
 the
 nature
 of


existence.
 Albert
 Kimu,
 a
 massive


influential
 philosophical
 uh,
 influence


on
 myself
 and
 and
 uh,
 you
 know,
 I've


thought
 about
 mortality
 and
 death
 very


deeply.
 And
 the
 conclusion
 that
 I've


come
 to
 in
 regards
 to
 to
 the
 idea
 that


we
 all
 got
 to
 die
 one
 day
 is,


you
 know,
 you
 you
 it's
 as
 cheesy
 as
 it


sounds.
 You've
 got
 to
 make
 the
 most
 of


the
 finite
 time
 you
 have
 on
 life.
 And


quite
 frankly,
 the
 finite
 nature
 of


existence
 is
 what
 brings
 purpose
 to


everything
 that
 we're
 doing.
 If
 you


could
 live
 forever,
 it
 might
 not
 be
 as


valuable.
 you
 know,
 you
 you
 might
 not


feel
 as
 uh
 uh
 excited
 to
 take
 on
 the


day-to-day
 responsibilities
 of
 being


alive
 and
 the
 day-to-day
 tragedies
 and


chaos
 of
 existence
 and
 having
 to
 live


and
 pay
 the
 bills
 and
 like
 to
 to
 get


through
 all
 that
 [ __ ]
 every
 day
 is
 a


journey.
 And
 to
 even
 feel
 that
 that


journey
 is
 worth
 going
 on,
 you've
 got
 to


be
 you've
 got
 to
 be
 excited
 to
 live
 in


the
 moment.
 Part
 of
 the
 reason,
 you


know,
 the
 the the
 the
 energy
 that
 people


feel
 comes
 from
 the
 market
 open,
 market


close
 every
 day,
 whether
 there
 were
 40


people
 or
 400
 people
 or
 4,000
 people


over
 the
 years
 that
 have
 been
 watching,


a
 lot
 of
 that
 energy
 comes
 from
 this


idea
 that
 you
 have,
 at least
 from
 my


perspective,
 one
 life.
 And
 the
 fact
 that


people
 even
 care
 to
 consume
 my
 content


in
 this
 one
 life
 means
 that
 I'm
 going
 to


give
 them
 the
 best
 show
 I
 can
 possibly


give
 them.
 And
 uh


that
 means
 bringing
 the
 most
 amount
 of


energy
 and
 excitement
 and
 enthusiasm
 and


and
 and
 and
 and
 and
 hopefully
 value
 to


people's
 daily
 lives


because
 you
 only
 have
 one
 chance
 to
 do


it,
 right?
 And
 eventually
 the
 show
 is


going
 to
 come
 to
 an
 end.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


that's
 at
 35,
 if
 that's
 at
 45,
 if
 that's


at
 50.
 Like
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 when
 we
 stop


doing
 the
 market
 open,
 market
 close,
 but


eventually
 there
 will
 be
 some
 end
 to
 the


show
 as
 there
 is
 with
 any
 show
 ever,


right?
 there's
 an
 eventually
 an
 end
 to


it.
 Uh,
 and
 so
 making
 the
 most
 of
 what


we've
 been
 building,
 which,
 you
 know,
 I


I
 don't
 want
 to
 end
 anytime
 soon
 because


I
 I
 just
 I
 just
 feel
 so
 grateful
 to
 be


able
 to
 do
 it
 every
 day.
 And
 the
 fact


that
 so
 many
 thousands
 of
 people
 feel


that
 same
 gratitude,


you
 know,
 it
 means
 a
 lot.


Shut
 your
 dirty
 mouth.
 You're
 never


ending
 the
 show.
 Dude,
 I've
 thought


about
 it
 that
 like
 when
 I
 took
 Friday


off,
 I
 was
 like,
 what
 if
 I
 actually
 took


like
 a
 month
 off?
 Like
 what
 would


happen,
 bro?


Like
 I
 just
 feel
 like
 so
 many
 people


would
 be
 like
 annoyed
 more
 than
 anything


because
 like
 yeah
 you
 guys
 like
 me
 but


you
 also
 like
 getting
 the
 news
 and
 the


updates
 and
 like
 you
 need
 to
 get
 it


every
 day
 and
 it's
 like
 there's
 not
 that


many
 people
 doing
 this
 in
 a
 way
 that
 I


think
 is
 as
 succinct
 as
 as
 hopefully


I've
 been
 able
 to
 put
 it
 every
 morning


and
 and
 afternoon
 and
 I
 definitely
 think


a
 lot
 of
 people
 would
 be
 pissed
 off.
 But


I
 uh
 I
 also
 have
 no
 intention
 to
 stop


because
 you
 know
 I
 I
 think
 we're
 I


really
 just
 think
 we're
 at
 the
 beginning


of
 it.
 So


last
 thing
 I'll
 say
 is
 I
 think
 the


reason
 this
 whole
 thing
 has
 worked
 is


because
 there's
 a
 level
 of
 authenticity


towards
 building
 this
 um
 you
 know


whenever
 you're
 doing
 something
 really


creative
 you
 got
 to
 resonate
 with
 people


like
 the
 people
 are
 your
 boss
 right


whenever
 you're
 doing
 something
 creative


the
 people
 are
 your
 boss
 and
 and
 one


thing
 I've
 had
 to
 settle
 with
 over
 the


past
 couple
 of
 months
 now
 as
 the
 the


channel
 has
 grown
 more
 substantially
 and


and
 my
 name
 has
 grown
 more
 substantially


on
 like
 platforms
 like
 Twitter
 is


everyone
 has
 an
 opinion
 and
 if
 the
 boss


is
 the
 public
 then
 you
 know
 technically


you
 have
 to
 listen
 to
 every
 opinion
 but


also
 at
 the
 same
 time
 every
 opinion
 is


not
 equal
 right
 every
 you
 might
 have


some
 opinions
 from
 some
 people
 that


quite
 frankly
 don't
 have
 the
 best
 ideas


in
 the
 world
 but
 you
 still
 see
 their


opinions
 and
 so
 I
 think
 part
 of
 this


journey
 in
 remaining
 authentic
 is
 not


necessarily
 changing
 the
 way
 I
 am
 or
 the


way
 I
 operate
 or
 how
 I
 think
 about
 the


world
 because
 of
 what
 other
 people
 think


because
 trust
 me
 when
 you
 when
 when
 you


get
 to
 a
 stage
 where
 you're
 getting


thousands
 and
 thousands
 of
 uh
 opinions
 a


day
 just
 being
 thrown
 at
 you
 about
 a


variety
 of
 topics.
 You
 know,
 forget
 the


stock
 market,
 you
 have
 opinions
 about


anything
 about,
 you
 know,
 who
 you
 are
 as


a
 human
 being.
 Like,
 it
 is
 it
 is
 a
 bit


of
 a
 toll.
 And
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 say
 it


in
 a
 woe
 is
 me
 type
 of
 thing,
 but
 I
 do


want
 to
 say
 like
 there
 is
 a
 toll
 that,


you
 know,
 Tanner
 relates
 to
 this,
 you


know,
 so
 some
 of
 the
 other,
 you
 know,


guys
 who
 are
 doing
 this
 full-time,
 like


they
 they
 it's
 a
 lot
 you
 have
 to
 deal


with.
 You
 have
 to
 try
 to
 navigate
 your


mental
 stability
 when
 you're
 dealing


with
 all
 those
 opinions.
 But
 at
 the
 same


time,
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 you
 ignore


those
 opinions
 because
 those
 opinions


could
 actually
 be
 very
 helpful
 towards


making
 the
 show
 even
 better,


right?
 And
 and
 there
 are
 some
 some
 very


uh
 valid
 pieces
 of
 constructive


criticism
 that
 I've
 heard
 uh
 you
 know


over
 over
 the
 past
 three
 years
 on
 how
 to


make
 the
 show
 even
 better
 and
 how
 to
 how


to
 bring
 more
 value
 to
 people
 that
 are


consuming
 it.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 balance
 of


finding
 it's
 almost
 like
 going
 back
 to


Palanteer
 the
 balance
 of
 them
 listening


to
 their
 customers
 even
 though
 their


entire
 forward
 deployed
 engineering


model
 is
 them
 making
 the
 customers


listen
 to
 them
 while
 also
 being


authentic
 enough
 for
 them
 to
 say
 look
 we


are
 going
 to
 still
 be
 forward
 deployed


and
 the
 world
 can
 call
 it
 a
 consulting


firm
 we
 don't
 care
 but
 like
 this
 is
 how


we
 do
 business
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 listen


to
 what
 you
 have
 to
 say
 but
 this
 is
 the


way
 that
 we
 know
 is
 the
 right
 way
 to
 do


it
 that
 tends
 to
 work
 out
 long
 term
 if


you
 can
 strike
 a
 balance
 and
 for
 me
 I


think
 it's
 very
 similar
 It's
 like
 the


amount
 of
 freaking
 brand
 deals
 that
 I've


got
 over
 the
 past
 honestly
 like
 three


months.
 The
 amount
 of
 people
 hitting
 me,


the
 amount
 of
 offers
 of
 just
 like,
 "Hey,


literally
 you
 just
 have
 to
 say
 this
 once


and
 we'll
 pay
 you
 $25,000."
 Like
 making


sure
 who
 you
 are
 is
 not
 a
 disvalue
 to


the
 audience.
 Number
 one,
 and
 making


sure
 that
 you
 reject
 anything
 that
 even


even
 has
 a
 chance
 of
 like
 like
 like


corrupting
 that
 that
 ethos,
 which
 is


again
 what
 I
 think
 has
 made
 Palunter
 so


special.
 they
 just
 they
 they
 don't
 they


don't
 um
 negotiate
 on
 their
 values


because
 they
 have
 those
 hard
 set
 in


stone.
 That
 is
 what
 will
 keep
 the


channel
 growing.
 And
 I've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of


YouTubers
 in
 the
 finance
 space
 that
 go


the
 opposite
 direction.
 They
 they
 like


the
 quick
 buck
 for
 whatever
 reason.
 I
 I


don't
 understand
 how
 money
 becomes
 such


an
 obsessive
 force
 in
 people's
 lives.
 Uh


I'm
 not
 saying
 this
 as
 a
 guy
 with
 tons


and
 tons
 and
 tons
 of
 money.
 I've
 been


broke
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 years.
 only


really
 over
 the
 past
 12
 months
 have
 I


started
 to
 actually
 get
 a
 little
 bit


more
 financially
 independent.
 You
 know,


I'm
 not
 saying
 I'm
 not
 some
 trust
 fund


baby
 with
 millions
 of
 dollars
 saying,


"Oh,
 I
 don't get
 why
 people
 care
 about


money."
 I'm
 saying
 this
 more
 so
 in
 the


context
 of
 hey
 I've
 been
 broke
 and
 I've


worked
 really
 hard
 and
 pounder
 and
 hood


have
 and
 Nvidia
 have
 pounder
 and
 hood


being
 the
 main
 ones
 but
 Nvidia
 this
 year


as
 well
 you
 know
 two
 to
 two too
 I
 I


we've
 had
 some
 help
 over
 the
 past
 couple


years
 with
 some
 pretty
 good
 investments


but
 I
 don't
 see
 the
 need
 to
 compromise


on
 your
 values
 just
 to
 get
 another
 quick


buck
 and
 I
 I
 really
 do
 think
 that
 is


what
 will
 keep
 the
 channel
 pure
 and


authentic
 over
 the
 lifetime
 of
 doing


this
 as
 soon
 as
 I
 I
 I
 I
 negotiate
 on


those
 values
 is
 everything's
 [ __ ]


Everything


and
 and
 and
 and
 that
 is
 uh
 I
 guess
 the


last
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 say
 is
 that
 you


don't
 want
 to
 negotiate
 on
 core
 values


and
 and
 you
 know
 take
 that
 take
 that


from
 the
 channel
 to
 your
 own
 life.


Whatever
 values
 you
 don't
 negotiate
 on


you
 don't
 negotiate
 on
 and
 and
 and
 no


matter
 how
 compelling
 the
 offers
 are


staying
 true
 to
 it
 is
 is
 is
 is
 what
 I


mean
 again
 going
 back
 to
 Pounder
 they


said
 they
 would
 never
 sell
 to
 Russia
 and


China.
 Look
 at
 what
 has
 happened
 over


the
 past
 couple
 years
 with
 Russia
 and


China.
 Like
 sometimes
 your
 values
 are


your
 values
 and
 when
 you
 come
 up
 with


them
 in
 the
 first
 place,
 you
 really
 have


to
 ask
 yourself,
 are
 you
 going
 to
 leave


them?
 And
 if
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 leave


them,
 then
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 take


it
 the
 harder
 way
 because
 Russia
 and


China
 would
 have
 paid
 a
 lot
 of
 money.


But
 you
 know,
 Karp
 had
 a
 different


vision.


And
 so
 with
 this
 channel,
 I
 have
 the


same
 vision.
 I
 just
 want
 to
 keep
 it
 as


authentic
 as
 possible
 and
 keeping
 it


going
 for
 the
 long
 term.


Mid
 is
 the
 Japanese
 prime
 minister.


Never
 heard
 that
 one
 before.
 That's
 a


good
 one.
 That's
 a
 good
 one.
 All right,


that's
 it.
 Thank
 everybody.
 Means
 a
 lot.


Means
 the
 world.
 Appreciate
 you
 being


here.
 I
 will
 try
 to
 remain
 as
 uh
 as
 much


as
 a


core
 human
 that
 I've
 been
 uh
 since
 2021


when
 starting
 this
 channel


throughout
 the
 ups
 and
 downs
 and
 you


know
 mistakes
 whatever
 has
 happened
 I


think
 has
 led
 to
 to
 this
 moment
 and
 uh


at
 its
 core
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 think
 it's


been
 the
 journey
 of
 a
 lifetime.
 It's


been
 incredible
 to
 be
 here.
 I
 have
 not


drank
 Saratoga
 water
 ever
 since.
 See,


listening
 to
 going
 back
 to
 listening
 to


people's
 feedback.
 I've
 not
 drank
 that


damn
 water.
 That's
 why
 this
 bull
 market


has
 really
 continued
 because
 if
 I
 did


and
 you
 guys
 found
 out,
 I
 mean,


genuinely,
 look,
 like
 when
 I
 I'm
 not


even
 lying,
 bro.
 I
 have
 not
 drank


Saratoga
 water
 ever
 since
 that
 day
 where


I
 drank
 it
 and
 the
 market
 fell
 down
 and


all
 you
 guys
 said,
 "I
 have
 to
 stop


drinking."
 Like
 I've
 been
 at
 events
 over


the
 past
 couple
 months
 where
 they
 offer


Saratoga
 and
 I
 literally
 go
 the
 opposite


and
 I
 get
 the
 other
 water
 and
 I'm
 like


I'm
 not
 drinking
 the
 Saratoga


because
 of
 you
 guys.
 That's
 how
 much


because
 because
 then
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 lie


about
 it
 and
 be
 like
 no
 of
 course
 I'm


not
 drink
 like
 no
 boy
 you
 were
 drinking


it
 the
 other
 day
 like
 what
 are
 you


talking
 so
 I
 can't
 lie
 but
 I've
 not


drank
 it
 because
 of
 you
 guys
 and


hopefully
 that
 keeps
 this
 bull
 market


going.
 So
 yeah,
 bro
 is
 literally


traumatized
 from
 this
 freaking
 Saratoga


bottle


that
 happened
 back
 in
 May.
 But
 again,


all
 these
 like
 little
 insiders
 and
 jokes


and
 stuff,
 that's
 what
 keeps
 it
 that's


what
 keeps
 it
 fresh.
 That's
 what
 keeps


it
 fun.
 And
 uh
 you
 know,
 that's
 what


keeps
 this
 community
 as
 thriving
 as
 it


is.
 So,


all
 right.
 Thank
 you.
 Appreciate
 it,


guys.
 I'm
 sorry
 if
 there's
 a
 couple


other
 super
 chats
 I
 did
 not
 get
 to.
 Uh


I'll
 try
 to
 get
 through
 these
 real


quick.
 Witchwatch,
 thank
 you
 for


becoming
 a
 channel
 member.
 Troy,
 thank


you
 for
 the
