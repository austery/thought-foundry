I want to bring in Lucy Gwo.
She's the youngest female, self-made
billionaire in the world.
She's the co-founder of Scale AI, which
after a multi-billion dollar investment
from media platforms, valued the company
more than $29 billion.
But that is not what she's working on
now.
She's the founder and CEO of Passes.
It helps social media influencers
diversify their income streams.
Think exclusive photos DM's video calls,
live streams and more.
She's also on the Bloomberg Businessweek
screen time ones to watch list.
She joins us here at Screen Time in
Hollywood.
How are you doing?
Well, thank you for having me.
You are doing well.
I get to play.
Life is pretty good.
Thank you.
Well, listen, I think if people hear the
description of passes, they probably the
first thing they think of might be only
fans.
So how do you make sure that you're
distinct from only fans?
Yeah, we don't really compete with them
because we have a strict no nudity
policy, which is what Onlyfans is known
for.
We're actually working on the 364
creators to really help them build their
businesses.
So I would think of us artists more as
infrastructure to monetize a creator's
brand.
And this is everything from like wealth
management to health insurance to
multiple features.
So like any creator can monetize,
whether it's through subscriptions or
selling one on one calls, etc..
Is there anyone you would say no to to
be on the platform?
Anyone can join the platform as long as
they're not creating new content.
So that's it.
That's the dividing line.
That's the dividing line.
So talk to us about your growth that
you're seeing on the platform in terms
of people, you know, wanting to be on
it, staying on it.
Talk to us about some of the velocity
that you're seeing.
Yeah, definitely.
Well, with creators that make over 5000
a month and we have near 100% retention,
which is really exciting.
We see it for X growth from 2023 to 20
mean 4 to 2025 and hopefully we'll see
more of that, which is exciting.
And then we have crossed nine figures in
earnings for creators, which is also
very exciting.
So those are just like high level
numbers I can share with you guys today.
Well, some of the reporting around
Onlyfans, for example, has has shown
that like there's a small number of
people who make the vast majority of the
money on the platform.
Is it more evenly distributed on passes?
I would definitely say it's more evenly
distributed, but I would also say that
like our top like let's say 30% of
creators make the majority of the GMV.
That's so that's a challenge for people
who are trying to get in.
I mean, I would say that anyone can make
money.
It's more so like the amount of people
that are willing to put in the time to
make the content right.
It's just like, how many of you are
willing to work hard to make that
income?
And when you just look like really every
career on this planet,
there's a limited amount of people
willing to put in the effort.
And we see that the people that are
willing to put in the efforts like churn
out content are the ones succeeding.
Lucy How do you bring or attract people
to the platform?
Like, what do you guys have to do?
So a lot of it is organic.
So word of mouth.
A lot of creators just talk about how
much they love the platform and how much
they've made and people hear about it,
so they end up joining.
Other than that, we do a lot of social
media, we do a lot of events because we
think that's a relationship driven
business where I think there's like
platform retention, but there's also
emotional retention.
And that motor retention comes like
people to people connections and the
creator economy.
Motor retention is a very real thing.
I would say it's potentially stronger
than platform retention.
So we work on a lot of face to face
interactions with creators as well.
You dropped out of Carnegie Mellon for a
Thiel Fellowship.
Obviously, in hindsight it was the right
move.
You went on to co-create scale.
AI Incredible success there.
I'm just curious, though, about your
view of higher education, having
participated in it for a short time and
then left.
How do you think higher education has to
change to prepare the next generation of
leaders, to prepare the next generation
of entrepreneurs?
Yeah.
So I think that with higher education,
what first of my view on higher
education is I actually encourage
everyone to do college for one or two
years, not because I think you're going
to be learning a lot in your classes,
but because I think there's no period of
time in your life that you're going to
be thrown into where you're going to be
in a high density of intellectual
individuals that all have no friends.
Like, if you think about it, even when
you graduate college and you go enter
the job force, most of the people at the
company that you're about to work for
already have friends.
So it's harder to break into a social
scene.
Versus college is the only period in
your life where literally everyone in
the freshman class knows nobody.
Right.
A grand social expect.
Exactly.
Yeah.
And it's a high density network of
people that are just as intellectually
intelligent as you.
And I think college is really where you
find your future co-founders, your
future hires, etc.
because when you're starting a company,
for example,
who is going to turn down a multimillion
dollar offer to join you and the most
talented people I get, most house
engineers are getting those straight out
of college right now.
Only people that like, really believe in
you because they have that emotional
connection.
So I really encourage everyone to go to
college and meet as many talented people
as they can the first one or two years.
In terms of how I see college moving on
towards the future.
I think from my own personal experience,
I do think that we could be learning a
lot more practical skills that we can
actually use in.
A job for us.
So, for example, when I was studying for
science at Carnegie Mellon, a lot of it
was very theoretical math.
And I felt like I learned the most about
product science, about actually like
making apps, etc., through hackathons
that I was attending every few weeks.
So it's almost like the concept of trade
schools Somewhere with higher education,
there's something there.
So we talk, yeah, we have like 20
seconds until the show is over.
So go ahead.
What's your 20 seconds on A.I.
in terms of humans?
Yeah.
So I think that it's going to have on
our world for sure.
I bad or indifferent, I'm excited.
I think that with every technological
innovation, things have improved in the
world for everybody.
I think that we should have you guys are
co-pilot and not something that's going
to replace us.
It's going to help us be better at our
jobs.
You're not scared?
No.
Should we be scared?
No.
All right.
