Hi
 everybody.
 I'm
 Nicola
 Tangan,
 the
 CEO


of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth
 Fund


and
 today
 I'm
 in
 really
 good
 company


with
 Christian
 Klein,
 the
 CEO
 of
 the


software
 giant
 SAP.
 Now
 SAP
 is
 now
 the


largest
 company
 in
 Europe,
 third
 largest


software
 company
 in
 the
 world
 and
 we
 own


just
 under
 3%
 of
 the
 company,
 $9
 billion


equivalent
 to
 100
 billion
 Norwegian


croner
 or
 20,000
 croner
 per
 Norwegian.


So
 it's
 a
 very
 big
 and
 important


position
 for
 us.
 Christian
 started
 as
 a


student
 intern
 in
 SAP
 like
 20
 years
 ago.


He
 became
 the
 CEO.
 Wow,
 what
 a
 journey.


Christian.
 Yeah,
 but
 you
 see
 my
 quay
 has


first
 of
 all
 now
 just
 to
 get
 a
 feel
 for


the
 importance
 of
 SAP.
 How
 much
 of
 the


world's
 business
 touches
 an
 SAP
 system?


Yeah,
 Nikolai,
 first
 of
 all,
 thanks
 for


the
 trust
 into
 SAP
 and
 indeed
 it
 was
 a


remarkable
 journey
 the
 last
 four
 years,


but
 of
 course
 you
 you
 feel
 you
 know
 the


that
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 world's


transactions
 are
 relying
 on
 SAP
 systems


and
 now
 especially
 with
 the
 cloud
 I
 mean


clients
 are
 very
 serious
 about
 you
 know


how
 do
 we
 want
 their
 most
 mission


critical
 systems
 and
 to
 your
 question


80%
 of
 the
 world's
 you
 know
 B2B


transactions
 one
 and
 touching
 an
 SAP


system
 wow
 how
 much
 of
 the
 largest


companies
 how
 many
 of
 the
 largest


companies
 in
 the
 world
 actually
 95%
 use


one
 or
 the
 other
 SAP
 system
 many
 of
 them


finance
 supply
 chain
 obviously
 but
 we


have
 HR
 I
 mean
 we
 have
 probably
 in
 the


SAS
 space
 the
 broadest
 portfolio
 in
 our


industry
 it's
 so
 unbelievable
 now
 for


the
 people
 who
 don't
 know
 what
 uh
 ERP
 is


what
 so
 stands
 for
 enterprise
 resource


planning
 system
 what
 what
 kind
 of
 things


are
 you
 involved
 with
 I
 mean
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 talk
 about
 digital
 transformation


these
 days
 and
 just
 you
 know
 to
 maybe


illustrate
 a
 bit
 what
 is
 the
 role
 of
 an


EIP
 because
 EIP
 often
 times
 sounds
 like


back
 office
 but
 it's
 not
 at
 all
 back


office
 you
 know
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


this
 morning
 I
 had
 a
 big
 you
 know
 car


manufacturer
 and
 they
 actually
 want
 to


offer
 you
 know
 mobility
 as
 a
 service
 in


the
 future
 so
 they
 need
 to
 change
 their


license
 model
 their
 pricing
 model
 they


also
 want
 to
 you
 know
 improve
 delivery


times
 and
 that
 is
 all
 connected
 to
 their


EIP
 yeah
 the
 way
 how
 you
 quote
 the
 way


how
 you
 price
 the
 way
 how
 you


manufacture
 deliver
 I
 mean
 that
 is
 all


part
 of
 an
 ERP
 and
 then
 we
 even
 go
 to


the
 front
 line
 Yeah,
 with
 commerce
 and


with
 our
 CX
 portfolio.
 So,
 it's
 really


covering
 the
 value
 chain,
 the
 mission


critical
 part
 of
 each
 value
 chain
 of
 a


company.
 And
 here
 comes
 also
 my
 passion.


Yeah,
 it's
 it's
 a
 piece
 of
 technology,


Nikolai.
 But
 at
 the
 end,
 what
 it
 does,


it
 connects
 business.
 It
 actually
 wants


business
 processes.
 And
 that
 is
 actually


the
 fascination
 what
 is
 so
 special
 about


SAP.
 We
 are
 wanting
 the
 world's
 most


mission
 critical
 business
 processes.


Now,
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 why
 I
 love
 SAP


is
 because
 you're
 so
 integrated
 in


people's
 businesses.
 Yes.
 Yes,
 it's
 not


it's
 not
 you
 can
 just
 change
 your


system.
 So,
 how
 often
 do
 you
 lose
 a


client?


Okay.
 And
 not
 very
 often
 and
 indeed.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 but
 I
 don't
 like
 it
 when


we
 talk
 about
 a
 lock
 in
 of
 customers
 in


SAP.
 I
 mean,
 they
 they
 want
 to
 see
 the


value.
 I
 mean,
 first
 of
 all,
 and
 when
 we


talk
 to
 Apple,
 when
 we
 talk
 about,
 you


know,
 the
 their
 portfolio,
 I
 mean,
 they


really
 also
 challenge
 us
 from
 time
 to


time.
 They
 say,
 "Hey,
 we
 also
 have
 to,


you
 know,
 squeeze
 for
 further


productivity.
 How
 can
 we
 automate
 our


supply
 chain?"
 And
 they
 also
 then
 offer


new
 solutions.
 They
 want
 to
 offer
 new


license
 modules.
 So
 it's
 it's
 very


important
 that
 we
 also
 follow
 you
 know


what
 our
 customers
 you
 know
 need
 for


their
 transformation.
 And
 of
 course
 when


you
 are
 running
 a
 mission
 critical


business
 Nikolai
 I
 mean
 you
 don't
 change


your
 EIP
 you
 know
 every
 year.
 So
 it's


indeed
 a
 very
 sticky
 business
 but
 it's


also
 an
 earned
 business.
 But
 how
 does
 it


but
 how
 much
 work
 does
 it
 involve
 to
 get


it
 installed?
 Yeah.
 See
 I
 mean
 that
 is


of
 course
 depends
 how
 many
 Yeah.
 I
 mean


depends
 on
 the
 size
 and
 what
 kind
 of


business
 you're
 running.
 I
 mean
 there
 of


course
 you
 know
 when
 you
 talk
 you
 know


about
 100
 warehouses
 in
 the
 world
 or


factories
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 complex


business.
 Yeah.
 To
 run
 manufacturing
 to


run
 logistics
 that
 takes
 a
 bit
 longer


but
 just
 you
 know
 because
 you
 also
 need


to
 involve
 the
 business
 and
 then


implement
 you
 know
 the
 software
 all
 over


the
 world.
 When
 we
 talk
 about
 HR
 about


finance
 you
 can
 have
 really
 fast
 go


lives.
 Yeah.
 And
 then
 it
 of
 also
 depends


on
 the
 size
 of
 the
 customers.
 I
 mean
 we


have
 also
 SAP
 is
 known
 for
 you
 know


large
 enterprises
 ERPs
 but
 we
 also


having
 actually
 80%
 of
 our
 customers
 are


mid-market
 customers
 and
 there
 when
 you


actually
 adhere
 to
 our
 template
 our
 best


practices
 you
 can
 also
 have
 go
 live
 in


three
 to
 four
 weeks
 absolutely
 possible


if
 you
 adhere
 to
 the
 standard
 if
 you


want
 to
 apply
 the
 best
 practices
 you


don't
 want
 to
 configure
 that
 much
 then


actually
 you
 know
 SAP
 is
 also
 very
 agile


but
 companies
 often
 also
 change
 the
 way


they
 work
 right
 and
 the
 logistical


systems
 when
 they
 introduce
 your


software.
 Yes.
 How
 does
 that
 work?
 I


mean
 that
 is
 actually
 the
 part
 why
 we


also
 said
 four
 years
 ago
 we
 are
 not
 only


doing
 a
 transformation
 into
 the
 cloud.
 I


mean
 at
 the
 end
 we
 are
 wanting
 mission


critical
 businesses
 and
 we
 want
 to
 start


with
 the
 end
 users
 and
 for
 them
 a


transformation
 is
 a
 change
 of
 the
 way


how
 they
 work
 and
 the
 the
 way
 how
 the


the
 company
 operates
 and
 that's
 why
 we


said
 let's
 also
 focus
 on
 not
 only


implementing
 our
 technology
 but
 also


let's
 focus
 on
 the
 change
 management


start
 with
 the
 end
 user.
 they
 do
 a
 piece


of
 work
 today
 like
 that.
 How
 will
 this


work
 look
 to
 tomorrow?
 What
 kind
 of


automation
 can
 we
 bring
 in
 so
 that
 the


end
 user
 can
 focus
 on
 more
 value
 adding


task?
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 you
 know
 what
 SAP


does
 with
 our
 clients
 so
 that
 they
 also


maximize
 the
 value
 not
 only
 it
 wise
 but


also
 business-wise.


You
 say
 you
 don't
 um
 look
 at
 it
 as
 if


you
 are
 locking
 in
 the
 customer
 but
 I


mean
 they
 are
 quite
 uh
 what
 should
 we


say
 they
 are
 very
 dependent
 on
 you.
 Mhm.


How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 your
 ability
 to


increase
 prices?
 Just
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do


you
 weigh
 that?
 I
 mean
 first
 um
 you
 know


the
 way
 how
 we
 do
 our
 pricing.
 I
 mean


first
 of
 all
 we
 look
 at
 the
 piece
 of


technology.
 I
 mean
 AI
 is
 a
 great


example.
 We
 have
 a
 consumption
 based


pricing
 module.
 We
 look
 into
 you
 know


what
 does
 this
 AI
 use
 case
 do?
 How
 many


transactions
 can
 you
 automate?
 You
 know


how
 faster
 can
 you
 actually
 quote?
 How


much
 more
 intelligent
 will
 your
 pricing


be?
 How
 much
 better
 can
 you
 optimize


your
 inventory?
 Then
 we
 define
 the


output
 the
 outcome
 and
 then
 you
 know
 the


customers
 can
 actually
 calculate
 you


know
 what
 does
 it
 cost
 but
 they
 also
 see


then
 the
 outcome
 in
 terms
 of
 more


automation
 more
 productivity
 more


intelligence
 in
 the
 way
 how
 they
 run


their
 business
 and
 that
 is
 the


correlation
 and
 then
 on
 inflation


obviously
 a
 big
 other
 topic
 we
 want
 to


treat
 our
 customers
 very
 fairly
 we
 said


look
 there
 is
 a
 a
 maximum
 price
 increase


which
 is
 very
 fair
 but
 it
 also
 can
 be


lower
 in
 case
 you
 know
 inflation
 is
 is


lower.
 So
 we
 actually
 do
 this
 in
 my
 eyes


in
 a
 very
 fair
 manner
 and
 so
 that


customers
 also
 see
 they
 have
 also
 a
 kind


of
 price
 protection
 with
 SAP.
 Are
 there


any
 verticals
 which
 you
 haven't
 really


addressed
 enough
 yet?
 I
 mean
 actually
 we


won
 25
 industries
 and
 the
 horizontal


layer
 is
 actually
 often
 times
 really
 SAP


and
 then
 of
 course
 in
 many
 industries
 we


also
 go
 into
 deep
 verticalization.
 I


mean
 just
 last
 week
 I
 had
 a
 Scottish


utilities
 company
 here.
 We
 talk
 about


the
 metering
 how
 to
 better
 you
 know


improve
 asset
 management
 for
 the
 grids.


So
 there
 we
 have
 also
 deep


verticalization
 in
 our
 in
 our
 portfolio.


Same
 for
 retail
 when
 it
 comes
 about


customer
 loyalty
 management,
 returns


claims
 management.
 These
 are
 the
 the
 the


verticals
 we
 provide
 and
 we
 provide


actually
 a
 lot
 of
 vertical
 applications


and
 but
 also
 customers
 and
 partners
 also


can
 build
 extensions
 on
 our
 platform


because
 you
 need
 data
 oftent
 times
 from


the
 ERP
 be
 it
 supply
 chain
 finance
 data


order
 data
 customer
 data
 and
 then


customers
 say
 hey
 I
 also
 want
 to
 build


my
 own
 IP
 okay
 here
 we
 go
 you
 have
 the


our
 platform
 called
 BP
 there's
 our
 data


model
 our
 identity
 so
 you
 can
 natively


integrate
 and
 then
 you
 can
 also
 build


your
 own
 vertical
 solutions


also
 possible.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 we've


seen
 more
 of
 lately
 is
 technological


nationalism.
 Mhm.
 What
 what
 are
 the


issues
 here
 for
 you?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 these


days
 Yeah,
 it's
 big.
 And
 um
 you
 know,


tariffs,
 um
 you
 know,
 protection
 and
 new


sovereignity,
 you
 know,
 laws
 and


obviously
 for
 us,
 I
 mean,
 running


businesses
 in
 almost
 over
 140
 countries.


I
 mean,
 that
 is
 our
 commitment
 to
 our


clients.
 No
 matter
 if
 you
 do
 you
 know


business
 in
 China,
 in
 the
 US,
 in
 Europe,


in
 Southeast
 Asia,
 everywhere,
 we
 will


adhere
 to
 to
 local
 laws
 and
 not
 only


local
 tax
 requirements,
 but
 also


sovereign
 clouds.
 So
 we
 building
 now
 a


lot
 of
 sovereign
 clouds
 um
 you
 know


based
 of
 course
 on
 local
 laws
 about
 data


security,
 who's
 touching
 the
 data,
 data


sovereignity,
 where
 does
 the
 data
 will


be
 located
 and
 that's
 part
 of
 the


business
 I
 mean
 and
 that
 becomes
 of


course
 now
 these
 days
 more
 and
 more


important.
 Are
 you
 seeing
 more
 demand


now
 as
 European
 companies
 want
 to
 have
 a


European
 alternative
 to
 some
 of the


large
 US
 providers?


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 see
 signs
 for
 that.
 Um


people
 customers
 asking,
 hey,
 when
 this


continues,
 you
 know,
 how
 safe
 is
 my
 data


when
 it
 goes
 to
 the
 east,
 when
 it
 goes


to
 the
 west?
 So
 they
 are
 asking


definitely,
 hey
 SAP,
 uh
 can
 we
 also


localize
 our
 data
 more
 and
 more
 in


Europe
 even,
 you
 know,
 in
 nonregulated


industries?
 I
 mean
 in
 the
 public
 sector


in
 the
 regulated
 industries
 sovereign


cloud
 was
 always
 a
 big
 part
 yeah
 of
 the


business
 but
 also
 now
 we
 see
 it
 more
 and


more
 non-regulated
 business
 not
 that
 you


know
 customers
 now
 suddenly
 shifting


systems
 already
 around
 but
 you
 see
 you


know
 there's
 the
 risk
 is
 increasing
 so


there's
 also
 some
 uncertainty
 around


that
 topic
 absolutely
 now
 you
 sit
 in
 the


middle
 of
 kind
 of
 the
 global
 supply


chain
 here
 is
 there
 enough
 agility
 and


flexibility
 to
 cope
 with
 all
 these


changes
 in
 supply
 chains
 tariffs


inflation
 all
 these
 things.
 Uh
 I
 mean


yeah
 absolutely
 I
 mean
 the
 tech
 you
 know


especially
 in
 the
 cloud
 I
 mean
 we


deliver
 you
 know
 new
 releases
 in
 the


cloud
 you
 know
 every
 quarter
 if
 the


customer
 wants
 every
 year
 but
 so
 we
 can


deliver
 fast
 innovation.
 We
 can
 also


adjust
 you
 know
 our
 software
 to
 adhere


to
 any
 kind
 of
 tariffs
 you
 know now


which
 are
 coming
 up
 in
 every
 place
 in


the
 world.
 The
 point
 is
 of
 course
 what


we
 would
 love
 to
 see
 as
 a
 tech
 company


but
 I'm
 not
 only
 talking
 about
 SAP
 is
 of


course
 you
 know
 to
 have
 you
 know
 a


bigger
 you
 know
 sovereignity
 across


Europe.
 Yeah
 not
 having
 soenity
 in
 each


you
 know
 member
 state
 but
 really
 you


know
 having
 it
 across
 Europe
 because


that
 makes
 it
 you
 know
 easier
 to
 scale


and
 that
 makes
 it
 also
 easier
 to
 do


business
 with
 and
 will
 that
 happen
 you


think
 I'm
 not
 so
 optimistic.
 I
 mean
 the


point
 is
 you
 know
 it's
 same
 like
 you


know
 in
 in
 a
 in
 a
 private
 company.
 Yeah,


you
 need
 to
 give
 up
 power
 for
 the
 sake


of
 you
 know
 for
 the
 benefit
 of
 the
 of


the
 bigger
 union
 and
 you
 know
 it's
 it's


not
 always
 so
 easy
 to
 convince
 every


member
 state
 to
 give
 up
 power
 and
 say


look
 I
 actually
 you
 know
 remove
 my
 own


sovereignity
 requirements
 for
 the
 sake


of
 having
 you
 know
 one
 European


sovereignity
 requirement
 and
 that
 that


is
 of
 but
 I
 feel
 this
 is
 of
 course
 key


not
 only
 for
 for
 SAP
 we
 are
 doing


business
 everywhere
 we
 have
 our
 labs


everywhere
 but
 for
 the
 startups
 I
 mean


you
 They
 need
 scale.
 They
 need
 they
 need


to
 fast
 time
 to
 value
 and
 they
 need
 to


scale
 fast
 and
 for
 them
 of
 course
 that


would
 be
 very
 very
 important.
 How
 do
 you


um
 work
 with
 data
 privacy
 and
 cyber


security?
 I
 mean
 it's
 totally
 key.
 I


mean
 that
 would
 probably
 one
 of the


worst
 things
 that
 that
 could
 happen
 if


you
 got
 some
 malware
 really
 integrated


into
 your
 systems.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 mean
 it's


part
 of
 of
 all
 of
 our
 contracts
 with
 the


customers.
 they
 have
 clear
 SLAs
 on
 you


know
 on
 what
 happens
 in
 case
 there
 are


vulnerabilities.
 We
 of
 course
 invest
 you


know
 billions
 of
 R&D
 money
 into
 cyber
 I


mean
 it's
 actually
 for
 us
 a
 corporate


requirement
 and
 there
 are
 clear
 also


SLAs
 and
 requirements
 inside
 SAP
 so
 we


take
 this
 very
 serious
 we
 have
 the
 even


you
 know
 in
 the
 board
 regular
 checkups


so
 that
 the
 organization
 feels
 there's


no
 compromise
 around
 cyber
 security
 but


what
 I
 always
 tell
 my
 customers
 about
 is


when
 you
 look
 at
 SAP
 or
 our
 hyperscala


partners
 I
 mean
 we
 are
 putting
 a
 a
 big


firewall
 around
 the
 whole
 technical


stack.
 I
 mean
 as
 a
 midsize
 company


somewhere
 here
 in
 Germany
 or
 in
 Europe


or
 everywhere
 in
 the
 world.
 I
 mean
 it's


hard
 to
 deal
 you
 know
 with
 this
 you
 know


fast
 developments
 on
 cyber.
 So
 I
 would


say
 the
 cloud
 is
 another
 good
 reason
 now


to
 say
 for
 cyber
 I
 want
 to
 move
 to
 the


cloud.
 I
 give
 this
 you
 know
 topic
 also


in
 the
 hands
 of
 big
 technology
 companies


to
 secure
 my
 data
 to
 secure
 my
 system.


just
 seems
 like
 the
 attack
 surface
 is


getting
 bigger
 and
 bigger
 as
 everything


is
 digitalized,
 right?
 And
 you
 and
 you


have
 new
 type
 of
 enemies.
 Yeah,
 you
 have


a
 new
 you
 know
 bad
 actors.
 You
 you


actually
 the
 threats
 are
 increasing.
 I


mean
 we
 see
 it
 clearly.
 I
 mean
 you
 know


and
 that
 is
 you
 know
 the
 B2B
 data


especially
 in
 some
 industries
 is
 is
 very


mission
 critical.
 So
 yes
 you
 you
 have
 to


absolutely
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 have
 a


secure
 landscape
 up
 and
 running.
 Now
 if


you
 look
 at
 history
 u
 Amazon
 uh
 kind
 of


invented
 cloud
 computing.
 Why
 why
 wasn't


it
 SAP?
 Yeah,
 Nikolai,
 that's
 a
 good


question.
 I
 mean,
 um,
 look,
 the
 good


piece
 is
 now
 you
 see
 it
 in
 our
 numbers.


We
 are
 there,
 we
 are
 super
 successful.
 I


would
 say
 we
 have
 the
 fastest
 grows
 in


the
 SAS
 space.
 But
 the
 point
 is,
 of


course,
 you
 know,
 why
 didn't
 we
 see
 it,


you
 know,
 15,
 20
 years
 ago.
 I
 mean,


there's
 a
 a
 good
 book
 about
 the
 invaders


dilemma.
 I
 said
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 truth


into
 it.
 Yeah.
 You
 have
 a
 well-run


traditional
 business
 model.
 it
 delivers


good
 quotes growth,
 good
 profits
 and
 and


you
 don't
 realize
 hey
 how
 fast
 can
 the


market
 change
 actually
 and
 then
 to
 to


tell
 you
 know
 your
 customers
 to
 tell


your
 employees
 and
 even
 you
 know
 worse


sometimes
 to
 tell
 the
 capital
 markets
 to


say
 hey
 I
 going
 to
 disrupt
 my
 own


business
 module
 and
 I'm
 you
 know


building
 now
 a
 diff
 different
 business


model
 in
 parallel
 which
 costs
 probably
 a


lot
 of
 money
 you
 know
 it's
 not
 that
 easy


for
 a
 moment
 where
 you
 realized
 you


needed
 to
 change.
 I
 mean
 for
 me
 I
 mean


it
 was
 pretty
 clear
 already
 when
 we


acquired
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 know
 cloud


products.
 It
 was
 clear
 that
 the
 market


is
 is
 changing
 and
 for
 me
 I
 mean


personally
 I
 always
 thought
 hey
 we
 need


to
 bet
 even
 more
 on
 the
 cloud.
 I
 mean


you
 see
 you
 know
 where
 the
 customers
 is


going
 and
 and
 so
 it
 was
 for
 me
 very


clear
 in
 2019
 when
 I
 became
 the
 co-CEO


of
 the
 company
 that
 we
 have
 to
 double


down
 on
 our
 cloud
 transformation.


Absolutely.
 I
 mean
 nicolai
 we
 are
 have


50,000
 developers
 they
 are
 coding
 great


stuff
 every
 day
 a
 lot
 of
 AI
 use
 cases


are
 really
 good
 stuff
 but
 what
 does
 it


help
 when
 you
 are
 sitting
 on
 an


8-year-old
 release
 and
 you're
 looking


into
 a
 screen
 which
 is
 you
 know
 probably


you
 know
 still
 touched
 you
 know
 by
 one


of
 our
 founders
 yeah
 so
 that
 is
 that


that
 is
 the
 problem
 yeah
 the
 innovation


gap
 is
 too
 big
 and
 we
 are
 coding
 a
 lot


of
 new
 capabilities
 for
 business
 model


transformation
 resiliency
 in
 supply


chain
 we
 have
 a
 green
 ledger
 you
 know


You
 can
 use
 a
 queen
 ledger
 to
 not
 only


guessing
 about
 carbon
 emissions
 but
 also


having
 actuals
 and
 you
 need
 to
 reduce


this
 this
 gap.
 Yeah.
 You
 between
 you


know
 the
 customers
 say
 here
 the
 latest


release
 is
 there
 and
 and
 the
 answer
 and


the
 solution
 to
 that
 is
 cloud.
 Sure.
 But


it's
 a
 tough
 decision
 to
 make
 right


because
 you
 do
 kind
 of
 you
 take
 a
 hit
 on


when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 share
 price
 and
 all


that
 kind
 of
 things
 right.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean


look
 I
 mean
 SAP
 had
 in
 20078
 we
 had
 a


company
 you
 know
 100%
 owned
 SAP
 SAP


hosting
 so
 some
 people
 here
 somewhere


you
 know
 realized
 there
 is
 something


coming
 maybe
 customers
 want
 to
 outsource


their
 IT
 systems
 to
 the
 cloud
 and
 then


we
 sold
 it
 what
 I
 figured
 out
 later
 is


you
 know
 the
 margin
 was
 not
 that
 high
 as


in
 our
 traditional
 business
 it
 was


actually
 you
 know
 not
 helping
 quarter
 by


quarter
 but
 then
 you
 know
 to
 the
 courage


to
 say
 you
 know
 what
 we
 go
 out
 to
 the


capital
 markets
 and
 say
 you
 know
 we
 have


our
 traditional
 business
 so
 to
 say
 more


our
 cash
 cow
 and
 then
 plus
 but
 we
 invest


into
 a
 new
 business
 model
 I
 mean
 that
 is


of
 course
 never
 easy
 and
 then
 look
 at


SEP
 the
 last
 four
 years
 when
 you
 would


ask
 now
 the
 people
 here
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


change
 also
 in
 the
 way
 how
 they
 work
 day


day
 over
 day
 the
 way
 how
 we
 incentivize


them
 the
 way
 how
 we
 measure
 success
 I


mean
 everything
 is
 changing
 it's
 a
 nice


piece
 of
 strategy
 paper
 but
 then
 to
 get


the
 strategy
 executed
 is
 you
 know
 often


times
 yeah
 the
 biggest
 challenge.
 How
 do


you
 think
 quantum
 computing
 will
 change


the
 way
 you
 work?
 um
 quantum
 I
 mean


definitely
 we're
 doing
 a
 research
 that


for example
 take
 supply
 chain
 yeah
 when


it
 comes
 about
 logistics
 optimization


yeah
 it's
 very
 very
 complex
 you
 need
 a


lot
 of
 computing
 power
 yeah
 to
 to


simulate
 you
 know
 logistical
 chains
 you


know
 how
 to
 bring
 a
 product
 A
 from


product
 B
 there
 millions
 of
 you
 know


value
 drivers
 who
 influence
 your


logistical
 supply
 chain
 and
 that
 is
 of


course
 you
 know
 one
 use
 case
 where
 we


definitely
 see
 it
 will
 be
 a
 big
 gamecher


if
 we
 can
 you
 know
 use
 quantum
 yeah
 in


the
 case
 of
 in
 the
 context
 of
 our
 supply


chain
 portfolio
 finance
 blockchain
 is
 of


course
 you
 know
 one
 another
 thing
 um
 but


you
 know
 these
 are
 the
 the
 early
 use


cases
 and
 you
 know
 when
 I'm
 talking
 to


our
 researchers
 they
 actually
 would
 say


now
 in
 three
 to
 four
 years
 I
 mean
 the


the
 technology
 should
 be
 that
 mature


that
 we
 really
 can
 apply
 it
 in
 the


context
 of
 our
 portfolio
 of
 our
 products


why
 haven't
 companies
 gotten
 more


productivity
 out
 of
 software
 in
 the
 past


yeah
 that's
 a
 good
 piece.
 I
 mean
 when
 I


before
 I
 became
 the
 the
 CEO
 um
 I
 asked


of
 course
 I
 was
 running
 here
 the
 IT


organization
 and
 I
 got
 presented
 a


business
 case
 I
 moved
 to
 S
 forana
 I
 said


oh
 great
 idea
 but
 what
 does
 it
 do
 to
 our


business
 what
 does
 it
 do
 our


transformation
 but
 it
 was
 purely
 planned


as
 a
 technical
 migration
 oh
 there's
 a


next
 ERP
 let's
 just
 technically
 migrate


I
 said
 what
 is
 now
 you
 know
 changing
 for


the
 benefit
 of
 our
 SAS
 module
 I
 mean
 we


won
 the
 company
 still
 as
 a
 onremise


company
 in
 many
 business
 processes.
 So


for
 me
 I
 guess
 it's
 very
 important
 that


the
 customers
 understand
 when
 you
 are


running
 an
 ERP
 project
 or
 let's
 take
 AI


you
 always
 have
 to
 have
 the
 business
 at


the
 table
 when
 you're
 coming
 in
 here
 and


you
 talk
 about
 ERP
 and
 there
 are
 only
 IT


people
 around
 the
 around
 the
 table
 I


would
 question
 will
 the
 customers
 see


the
 the
 maximum
 value
 of
 course
 it
 can


benefit
 of
 decreasing
 the
 cost
 of


running
 such
 a
 system
 there
 is
 of
 course


also
 a
 TCO
 game
 in
 that
 but
 it's
 very


very
 important
 that
 you
 connect
 you
 know


the
 technology
 with
 the
 business
 and


this
 is
 where
 companies
 struggle
 the


most
 with
 how
 to
 do
 it,
 how
 to
 integrate


the
 business.
 Is
 the
 business
 really


open
 for
 that
 kind
 of
 change?
 Is
 the


business
 open
 for
 automation
 for


standardization
 or
 is
 you
 know
 actually


has
 everyone
 the
 freedom
 to
 do
 whatever


they
 want
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 commodity


business.
 That
 is
 often
 times
 the


challenges
 in
 such
 software
 projects.


Let's
 move
 to
 AI.
 Um,
 what
 excites
 you


the
 most
 with
 AI?
 The
 possibilities,
 the


opportunities,
 what
 you
 can
 do
 with
 this


technology.
 I
 mean,
 I
 see
 it
 always
 in


the
 context
 of
 our
 customers
 business.


And
 I
 just
 had,
 you
 know,
 yesterday
 a


big,
 you
 know,
 French
 retailer
 here
 and


they
 do
 millions
 of
 changes
 to
 orders.


Yeah.
 They
 change
 orders
 every
 day


because
 consumers,
 you
 know,
 actually,


you
 know,
 do
 a
 change
 of
 what
 they


order.
 They
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 order
 changes
 in


the
 supply
 in
 the
 supplier
 space.
 And


now
 when
 you
 can
 see
 how
 you
 can


automate
 that.
 Yeah,
 with
 AI
 I
 mean
 for


them
 it's
 like
 a
 big
 productivity


booster.
 So
 if
 you
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


possibilities
 here
 uh
 and
 so
 from
 if
 you


were
 to
 try
 to
 rank
 them
 what
 are
 kind


of
 the
 most
 amazing
 things
 you're
 seeing


here
 starting
 from
 the
 biggest
 the


biggest
 changes
 over
 the
 next
 three
 to


five
 years
 the
 biggest
 changes
 is


actually
 in
 the
 context
 of
 SAP
 and
 AI
 is


definitely
 on
 the
 analytic
 space.
 I
 mean


you
 you
 today
 you
 going
 to
 figure
 out


you
 know
 your
 own
 planning
 simulations.


you're
 figuring
 out
 how
 does
 my
 supply


chain
 planning
 work
 in
 context
 with
 the


demand
 which
 is
 coming
 and
 when
 you
 see


now
 how
 AI
 and
 all
 these
 algorithms
 will


work
 and
 now
 you
 can
 not
 only
 bring


business
 data
 in
 but
 also
 a
 lot
 of
 other


content
 in
 I
 mean
 that
 makes
 of
 course


you
 know
 financial
 planning
 supply
 chain


planning
 workforce
 planning
 I
 mean
 will


be
 absolutely
 moved
 to
 a
 completely


different
 level
 uh
 so
 in
 the
 work
 of


intelligence
 the
 way
 how
 these
 plans
 are


integrated
 and
 of
 course
 how
 you
 then
 at


the
 end
 can
 optimize
 and
 run
 your


business
 or
 take
 another
 example
 on
 the


supply
 chain
 side.
 I
 mean
 a
 lot
 of
 our


customers
 spend
 billions
 of
 of
 dollars


on
 asset
 management.
 Yeah.
 So
 predictive


maintenance
 for
 assets
 is
 something


which
 will
 be
 of
 course
 hugely
 impacted


by
 generative
 AI
 but
 also
 traditional


AI.
 So
 that
 is
 definitely
 an
 area
 for


uptime
 of
 machines,
 uptime
 of
 factories.


I
 mean
 it's
 absolutely
 a
 big
 potential


there
 with
 AI.
 Yeah.
 To
 actually
 drive


further
 productivity
 for
 a
 company.
 So


these
 are
 some
 of
 the
 use
 cases
 we
 are


driving
 on
 and
 then
 talking
 about
 you


know
 the
 stuff
 which
 is
 coming
 now
 on
 a


chendic
 I
 mean
 how
 often
 did
 I
 sit
 in


front
 of
 an
 SAP
 system
 you
 know


analyzing
 you
 know
 our
 the
 payments
 over


to
 you
 and
 then
 you
 put
 the
 finance
 data


out
 oh
 over
 to
 you
 and
 then
 what
 is


actually
 the
 problem
 of
 this
 customer


why
 why
 is
 the
 customer
 not
 paying
 then


you
 can
 talk
 to
 sales
 you
 can
 talk
 to


logistics
 you
 can
 have
 maybe
 a


commercial
 issue
 and
 when
 you
 look
 now


at
 Chantic
 AI
 you
 can
 actually
 tell
 the


system,
 you
 know
 what,
 give
 me
 all


payments
 overdue,
 the
 top
 20
 or
 top
 100,


but
 then
 not
 only
 give
 me
 this
 report,


give
 me
 why
 is
 what
 is
 the
 root
 cause?


Why
 is
 this
 customer
 not
 paying?
 Is


there
 an
 sales
 issue?
 Is
 there
 a


logistical
 issue?
 Did
 we
 deliver
 too


late?
 Or
 is
 it
 a
 commercial
 issue?
 And


then
 when
 you
 think
 about
 that,
 you


know,
 what
 kind
 of
 answer
 do
 you
 get


back?
 And
 recommendations
 about
 what


kind
 of
 actions
 you
 should
 actually


take.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 remarkable.
 I
 mean


there
 you
 know
 actually
 today
 a
 lot
 of


humans
 being
 not
 only
 spend
 time
 but


probably
 not
 always
 figuring
 out
 a
 wide


you
 know
 call
 to
 action
 and
 that
 is
 now


what
 agendic
 will
 do.
 There's
 a
 finance


agent,
 there's
 a
 logistical
 agent,


there's
 a
 supply
 chain
 agent
 and
 they


will
 collaborate
 with
 each
 other
 and


they
 have
 so
 much
 more
 data
 you
 know
 in


the
 you
 know
 in
 their
 mind
 in
 their
 when


will
 you
 have
 a
 true
 identic
 AI
 where


actually
 the
 first
 one
 we
 already


shipped
 that
 is
 about
 you
 know
 the


services
 and
 the
 services
 agents
 we
 have


yeah
 when
 you're
 sitting
 in
 a
 in
 a
 call


center
 and
 you
 need
 to
 give
 advice
 uh
 to


a
 customer
 about
 are
 the
 assets
 you
 know


actually
 available
 what
 is
 the
 issue
 of


an
 asset
 that
 is
 already
 shipped
 and
 Now


we
 will
 launch
 at
 Sapphire
 we
 will


launch
 10
 more
 agent
 agentic
 AI
 use


cases
 and
 I
 mean
 is
 the
 big
 exhibition.


Yes
 exactly
 which
 is
 coming
 in
 May.
 Yeah


on
 average
 across
 your
 client
 base
 how


much
 do
 you
 think
 this
 can
 drive


productivity?
 I
 mean
 our
 promise
 to
 our


clients
 this
 year
 will
 be
 every
 end
 user


who's
 working
 with
 our
 AI
 so
 our
 digital


assistant
 tool
 with
 the
 embedded
 I
 use


cases
 yeah
 we
 can
 actually
 drive


productivity
 up
 to
 by
 30%.
 30%.
 Yeah,
 I


mean
 what
 across
 the
 whole
 company
 or


you
 have
 to
 it's
 not
 only
 a
 marketing


claim.
 No,
 but
 is
 that
 just
 for
 this


function
 or
 is
 it
 across
 the
 company?


It's
 actually
 across
 the
 company.
 Yeah.


When
 you
 are
 touching
 SAP
 software
 what


are
 the
 big
 what
 are
 the
 big
 things
 this


year
 which
 are
 going
 to
 drive
 30%


productivity
 gain.
 I
 mean
 it
 really


depends
 on
 you
 know
 you
 can
 take
 HR
 take


HR.
 Yeah.
 You
 actually
 when
 you're
 an
 HR


business
 partner
 you
 you
 you
 need
 to


hire
 you
 need
 to
 retain
 you
 need
 to
 hire


the
 right
 skills
 you
 need
 to
 retain
 the


right
 people.
 You
 actually
 need
 to
 bring


make
 sure
 that
 the
 learnings
 are


connected
 yeah
 to
 the
 skills
 of
 the


people.
 What
 what
 are
 the
 learning
 gaps


and
 that
 is
 you
 know
 somewhat
 something


what
 an
 HR
 agent
 will
 do
 for
 you.
 Job


postings
 done
 based
 on
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of


insights
 where
 is
 the
 skill
 gap
 in
 the


company
 what
 kind
 of
 skills
 do
 I
 need?


when
 you
 then
 put
 trainings
 together
 or


goal
 setting
 that
 will
 be
 taken
 over
 by


HR
 agent.
 Obviously
 an
 HR
 business


partner
 will
 have
 to
 say
 yes
 that
 is
 the


wide
 learning
 journey
 for
 this
 kind
 of


job
 profile
 but
 at
 the
 end
 you
 know
 in


in
 the
 past
 they
 had
 to
 type
 they
 had
 to


search
 what
 is
 the
 wide
 learnings
 for


them.
 Now
 an
 HR
 agent
 is
 doing
 this
 for


them
 and
 then
 they
 can
 confirm
 it
 if
 if


it
 fits
 you
 know
 to
 their
 expectations.


In
 finance
 when
 you
 are
 in
 FPNA
 I
 mean


you
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 data
 out
 of
 BW
 you're


doing
 financial
 simulations
 how
 you


going
 to
 end
 the
 year
 what
 is
 the
 sales


pipeline
 how
 can
 it
 influence
 my
 topline


I
 mean
 there
 is
 a
 finance
 and
 a
 sales


agent
 now
 doing
 this
 for
 you
 when
 is
 uh


aentic
 AI
 going
 to
 be
 so
 good
 that
 we


don't
 need
 SAP


actually
 I
 mean
 I
 would
 say
 um
 you
 know


at
 the
 end
 you
 need
 business
 software
 I


mean
 when
 you
 look
 at
 you
 And
 I
 know


there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 talk
 about
 you
 know


is
 SAS
 still
 relevant
 when
 AI
 is


broadcasting.
 I
 would
 say
 SAS
 is
 value


relevant
 because
 at
 the
 end
 every
 AI
 use


case
 needs
 data
 needs
 the
 business


context.
 I
 mean
 sorry
 to
 say
 I
 have
 no


imagination
 maybe
 someone
 out
 there
 has


how
 we
 could
 deliver
 our
 AI
 in
 the


context
 of
 the
 business
 without
 our


apps.
 I
 need
 a
 business
 context.
 I
 need


a
 context
 of
 the
 business
 process.
 I


need
 a
 semantical
 data
 structure
 of
 the


customer.
 I
 mean
 it's
 not
 like
 you
 know


that
 you
 can
 just
 implement
 an
 large


language
 model
 from
 any
 kind
 of
 render


uh
 and
 then
 say
 okay
 I'm
 now
 having
 you


know
 AI
 working
 for
 my
 business.
 No


large
 language
 model
 on
 this
 globe


understands
 business
 data
 has
 access
 to


business
 data
 understands
 the
 business


context
 and
 that's
 why
 we
 are
 saying
 yes


we
 use
 the
 LLMs
 for
 the
 unstructured


content
 for
 you
 know
 actually
 for
 speech


to
 text
 but
 at
 the
 end
 what
 it
 really
 is


the
 differentiator
 for
 us
 is
 our
 AI


foundation
 who
 understands
 the


businesses
 the
 business
 processes
 and


the
 business
 data
 so
 when
 we
 have
 made


this
 new
 great


uh
 genetic
 AI


Mhm.
 And
 we
 are
 putting
 this
 model
 in


charge
 of
 running
 SAP.
 Uh
 what
 part
 is


it
 that
 you
 would
 be
 happy
 to
 see
 go
 and


what
 part
 would
 you
 absolutely
 keep


yourself?
 Um
 I
 mean
 first
 I
 mean


obviously
 I
 mean
 our
 overarching
 goal
 is


to
 deliver
 more
 value.
 If
 the
 customer


delivers
 more
 value
 I
 have
 a
 belief
 they


will
 rely
 more
 on
 SAP
 software
 to
 run


their
 business.
 And
 obviously
 what
 we


want
 to
 shrink
 and
 reduce
 and
 remove
 is


the
 time
 to
 implement
 the
 software.


Yeah.
 The
 time
 what
 part
 what
 part
 of


your
 job
 do
 you
 think
 is
 a
 bit
 dull?
 My


job.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 look
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 still
 believe
 there
 are


human
 beings
 who
 are
 making
 decisions.


Yeah.
 Who
 will
 you
 know
 I
 mean
 I'm


traveling
 the
 world.
 I'm
 visiting


customers,
 partners,
 investors.
 And
 I


still
 believe
 that
 is
 you
 know
 something


what
 human
 beings
 and
 my
 co
 has
 to
 do.


But
 what
 will
 be
 of
 course
 you
 know
 much


less
 is
 when
 I'm
 getting
 prepped
 for
 my


earnings
 when
 I'm
 getting
 prepped
 you


know
 for
 a
 conference
 etc.
 I
 mean
 a
 lot


of
 that
 will
 be
 highly
 automated.


So
 what
 is
 it
 that
 you
 look
 forward
 to


not
 doing
 in
 this
 year?
 Me
 personally


yeah
 I
 mean
 what
 I'm
 not
 doing
 is
 in
 in


the
 past
 you
 know
 I'm
 still
 know
 our


products.
 I
 still
 know
 our
 solutions.
 So


sometimes
 I
 go
 in
 and
 look
 into
 goals.
 I


look
 into
 learnings.
 I
 look
 into


financial
 numbers.
 So
 I'm
 able
 to
 really


access
 our
 finance
 solutions
 still
 and


in
 what
 I'm
 not
 doing
 anymore
 is
 typing


in
 a
 lot
 of
 transactions
 uh
 to
 get
 the


information
 I
 would
 like
 to
 get
 out
 of


our
 system.
 So
 I'm
 an
 end
 user
 of
 SAP


software
 as
 well
 and
 that
 is
 of
 course


I'm
 using
 jewel
 I'm
 using
 a
 lot
 of
 AI


and
 I
 see
 you
 know
 by
 myself
 how
 I
 also


will
 get
 more
 productive.
 Yeah,
 just


this
 morning
 I
 looked
 into
 our
 P&L.
 I


cannot
 talk
 about
 our
 earnings,
 but
 I


wanted
 to
 see
 where
 we
 stand
 and
 when
 I


looked
 at
 how
 I
 did
 it
 in
 the
 past
 and


how
 I'm
 doing
 it
 today.
 I'm
 not
 only


getting
 a
 P&L
 report
 with
 one
 mouse


click
 or
 actually
 with
 one,
 you
 know,


talking
 to
 Jewel,
 please
 give
 me
 my
 Q1


P&L.
 I
 can
 also
 say
 give
 me
 a
 prediction


about,
 you
 know,
 what
 is
 our
 current


cloud


backloings
 we
 did,
 etc.
 So
 that
 is,
 you


know,
 of
 course,
 more
 intelligent
 and


way
 more
 automated.
 Yeah,
 also
 for
 me
 as


a
 CEO
 now
 uh
 many
 private
 companies
 are


uh
 doing
 well
 here.
 What
 about


governments
 and
 public
 sectors
 across


Europe
 for
 instance?
 Yeah.
 What's
 this


what's
 the
 what's
 the
 scope
 here?
 Yeah.


I
 mean
 you
 know
 when
 you
 look
 at
 Germany


or
 France
 I
 mean
 there
 is
 not
 a
 question


anymore
 should
 we
 go
 cloud
 they
 all


convinced
 about
 cloud.
 They
 all
 want
 to


use
 AI.
 they
 see
 you
 know
 also
 for
 the


citizens
 the
 all
 the
 citizen
 services


you
 know
 you
 can
 actually
 digitize
 a
 lot


and
 you
 can
 actually
 make
 this
 also
 m


make
 the
 citizens
 more
 happy
 with


embedded
 AI
 now
 they
 of
 course
 have
 way


more
 regulations
 on
 you
 know
 what
 what


what
 does
 happen
 with
 the
 data
 they
 have


you
 know
 clear
 very
 clear
 sovereign


cloud
 requirements
 and
 so
 we
 investing


yeah
 we
 have
 deos
 here
 in
 Germany
 we


have
 in
 in
 France
 we
 have
 together
 with


cup
 gemini
 Microsoft
 we
 have
 blue
 so
 we


They're
 building
 these
 sovereign
 clouds


to
 also
 then
 say
 hey
 but
 now
 you
 know


every
 government
 every
 public
 sector


agency
 can
 also
 then
 you
 know
 do


business
 and
 run
 their
 business
 with
 SAP


in
 the
 cloud.
 Is
 there
 a
 real


willingness
 amongst
 public
 sector
 to


rationalize?


Yeah,
 look,
 I
 mean
 sometimes
 I
 see


there's
 some,
 you
 know,
 um,
 of
 course


they
 they
 are
 a
 bit
 more
 risk
 averse.


Um,
 and
 of
 course,
 you
 know,
 when
 you


want
 to
 digitize
 a
 certain
 agency,
 you


are
 touching,
 you
 know,
 usually


thousands
 of
 end
 users
 and
 when


something
 goes
 wrong,
 you
 get


criticized.
 The
 problem
 here
 is
 when


everything
 goes
 right,
 usually
 no
 one


talks
 about
 that.
 And
 then
 you
 know


sometimes
 I
 see
 you
 know
 governments
 you


know
 politicians
 getting
 a
 little
 bit


shy
 or
 whisker
 worse
 to
 make
 those


decisions
 just
 you
 know
 because
 when
 you


stay
 on
 the
 status
 quo
 everything
 stays


like
 it
 is
 and
 I
 cannot
 get
 criticized


the
 problem
 is
 every
 stays
 everything


also
 stays
 very
 bureaucratic
 very
 manual


so
 but
 we
 see
 now
 that
 it's
 moving
 but


clearly
 the
 public
 sector
 is
 definitely


not
 a
 front
 runner
 when
 it
 comes
 to


digitization.
 Yeah.
 No
 no
 I
 mean
 the


safest
 way
 not
 to
 make
 mistakes
 is
 not


to
 do
 anything
 right.
 What
 is
 work
 going


to
 look
 like
 in
 10
 years
 time?
 In
 10


years
 time
 um
 look
 I
 I
 really
 believe


that
 um
 when
 you
 when
 you
 look
 at
 no


matter
 in
 a
 company
 which
 function
 you


want
 to
 take
 I
 would
 say
 people
 can
 be


way
 more
 focused
 on
 you
 know
 on
 building


great
 strategy
 how
 is
 my
 industry


transforming
 but
 really
 not
 so
 much
 into


anymore
 you
 know
 going
 into
 you
 know


data
 analytics
 etc.
 I
 mean
 there
 will
 be


a
 lot
 you
 know
 what
 will
 be
 done
 by
 AI


or
 software
 to
 really
 supplement
 you


know
 your
 strategy
 work
 way
 more
 and
 the


same
 is
 true
 for
 you
 know
 as
 I
 said


before
 on
 finance
 or
 HR
 there's
 still


today
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 know
 manual


transactions
 documents
 which
 you
 need
 to


screen
 a
 lot
 of
 bureaucracy
 you
 you
 have


to
 deal
 with
 and
 I'm
 totally
 convinced
 a


lot
 of
 that
 will
 be
 taken
 out
 and
 will


allow
 HR
 business
 partner
 to
 think
 more


about
 hey
 what
 is
 the
 the
 workforce
 I


need
 in
 5
 years
 from
 now,
 how
 will
 my


skills
 change?
 And
 a
 lot
 will
 be
 done,


you
 know,
 in
 the
 back
 by
 software
 and


AI.
 What
 about
 the
 situation
 with


humanoids
 and
 and
 robots?
 So,
 I
 I
 met


this
 um
 robotic
 company
 uh
 earlier
 in


the
 week.
 I'm
 just
 amazed
 by
 how
 soon


they
 will
 be
 all
 over
 the
 place.
 Yeah.


What
 how
 is
 this
 going
 to
 impact


society?
 I
 mean,
 the
 impact
 is
 there


already
 today.
 I
 mean
 I
 have
 seen


warehouses
 in
 China
 and
 other
 places
 in


the
 world
 where
 95%
 of
 the
 work
 in
 a


warehouse
 is
 done
 by
 robots
 and
 I
 mean


that
 is
 already
 you
 know
 today
 changing


and
 that
 will
 continue
 I
 mean
 also
 the


way
 how
 you
 maintain
 factories
 how
 you


maintain
 machines
 will
 be
 completely


automated
 also
 by
 AI
 not
 only
 robots
 and


so
 your
 workforce
 will
 change
 I
 mean


even
 at
 SAP
 look
 at
 SAP
 I
 mean
 we


actually
 have
 today
 a
 profile
 of
 a


developer
 so
 we
 will
 still
 have
 many


developers
 also
 in
 5
 years
 from
 now
 but


the
 skill
 profile
 of
 a
 developer
 will


change
 a
 lot.
 Yeah.
 So
 the
 way
 how
 we


code
 the
 way
 how
 we
 will
 deliver


software
 will
 radically
 change.
 So
 it's


very
 important
 for
 every
 company
 to
 also


think
 about
 okay
 this
 is
 my
 workforce


here
 and
 today
 but
 also
 how
 does
 my


workforce
 need
 to
 transform
 skill-wise


and
 what
 kind
 of
 jobs
 do
 I
 need
 and


which
 kind
 of
 jobs
 will
 will
 do
 I
 won't


need
 anymore
 in
 the
 future.
 Europe
 how


is
 Europe
 doing?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 mean


look
 I
 would
 say
 still
 Europe
 has
 a
 lot


of
 strengths
 but
 you
 know
 these
 days
 I


would
 say
 Europe
 is
 not
 very


competitive.
 I
 mean
 you
 see
 I
 mean
 look


at
 Germany
 our
 economy
 is
 clearly


suffering
 other
 economies
 are
 doing


still
 better
 but
 I
 would
 say
 Europe
 is


you
 know
 losing
 a
 lot
 of
 trends
 just
 not


being
 by
 being
 not
 a
 union.
 Yeah,
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day
 we
 you
 know
 you
 need
 a


market
 a
 common
 market
 for
 banking
 union


for
 digitization
 for
 for
 infrastructure


and
 and and
 the
 point
 is
 yeah
 when
 you


look
 at
 the
 US
 when
 you
 look
 at
 China
 I


mean
 when
 you
 bundle
 your
 power
 you
 know


you
 also
 then
 you
 know
 have
 better


chances
 yeah
 when
 it
 comes
 to


competition
 not
 only
 in
 IT
 or
 tech
 it's


also
 about
 banking
 it's
 about
 retail
 etc


and
 this
 is
 something
 where
 I
 feel
 the


union
 is
 just
 not
 a
 union
 and
 that
 in
 my


eyes
 clearly
 has
 to
 change
 and
 there's


too
 much
 regulation.
 I
 mean
 you
 know


tell tell
 me
 about
 digital
 information


act.
 The
 digital
 information.
 Yeah.
 The


point
 is
 yeah
 I
 mean
 we
 are
 not
 against


for
 example
 the
 AI
 act.
 I
 guess
 AI


clearly
 needs
 a
 framework
 for


regulation.
 The
 point
 is
 only
 you
 have


the
 AI
 act
 on
 Europe
 but
 you
 still
 have


the
 den
 in
 Germany.
 Yeah.
 So
 another
 you


know
 clause
 around
 where
 you
 where
 it's


defined
 how
 data
 needs
 to
 be
 protected


you
 know
 how
 do
 we
 deal
 with
 consumer


data
 and
 so
 you
 know
 you
 have
 a
 new
 act


on
 EU
 level
 but
 you
 still
 have
 you
 know


different
 you
 know
 acts
 also
 then
 on
 in


the
 member
 states
 and
 then
 you're
 adding


one
 layer
 on
 top
 of
 another
 layer
 and


that
 is
 of
 course
 not
 contributing
 you


know
 to
 reduce
 bureaucracy
 you're
 adding


more
 bureaucracy
 and
 that
 makes
 also


that
 the
 ease
 of
 doing
 business
 is


getting
 harder
 not
 easier
 and
 that
 is


the
 kind
 of
 problem
 what
 we
 have
 in
 what


are
 the
 implications
 the
 the
 implication


when
 you
 sign
 a
 contract
 today
 around


you
 know
 with
 with
 a
 European
 company


and
 you
 embed
 AI
 into
 into
 the
 solution


and
 then
 finally
 into
 a
 commercial


contract.
 I
 mean
 you
 have
 you
 need
 way


more
 lawyers.
 Yeah.
 You
 need
 a
 lot
 of


lawyers.
 You
 need
 lawyers
 who
 understand


local
 law
 but
 then
 you
 need
 lawyers


understanding
 European
 law.
 And
 that


just
 shows
 I
 guess
 very
 well
 you
 know


the
 the
 the the
 difficulty
 of
 doing


business
 in
 in
 in
 Europe
 and
 when
 you


are
 signing
 a
 contract
 in
 the
 US
 you


know
 there's
 first
 of
 all
 much
 less


regulation
 but
 there
 are
 not
 different


regulations
 state
 by
 state
 and
 I
 mean


Nikolai
 we
 here
 in
 Europe
 in
 the
 last


two
 years
 we
 had
 to
 double
 the
 size
 you


know
 of
 our
 of
 our
 legal
 department
 just


to
 how
 big
 is
 your
 legal
 department
 now


here
 in
 in
 Europe


I
 I
 have
 to
 check
 but
 it's
 probably


around
 you
 know
 150
 people
 only
 for


commercial
 for
 contract
 you
 know


compliance
 checks
 are
 we
 compliant
 is


everything
 in
 the
 contract
 right
 and
 of


course
 customers
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 questions


around
 how
 do
 we
 do
 AI
 can
 help
 you
 with


that
 eventually
 yeah
 actually
 you
 you


are
 actually
 saying
 something
 which
 is


also
 very
 true
 when
 you
 see
 we
 do
 all


the
 refract
 checks
 is
 done
 by
 AI
 first


there's
 still
 a
 revenue
 accountant
 who


is
 then
 looking
 at
 the
 contract
 finally


but
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 refract
 checks


compliance
 checks
 which
 we
 are
 doing


with
 AI
 still
 you
 get
 every
 time
 new


regulation
 so
 the
 bureaucracy
 is
 also


increasing
 related
 question
 why
 are


there
 so
 few
 tech
 companies
 in
 Europe
 I


mean
 my
 big
 belief
 is
 when
 I
 think
 the


number
 is
 what
 three
 out
 of
 the
 top
 50


in
 the
 world
 and
 you're
 the
 number
 one


that's
 why
 that's
 right
 I
 mean
 look
 it's


of
 course
 about
 you
 know
 I
 mean
 you
 know


this
 better
 than
 I
 do
 about
 you
 know
 is


there
 enough
 people
 funds
 and
 willing
 to


take
 some
 risk
 and
 you
 know
 and
 fund
 you


know
 some
 early
 startups
 but
 I
 would
 say


money
 is
 not
 um
 the
 main
 issue
 we're


having
 here
 in
 Europe.
 I
 mean
 take
 for


example
 SAP
 there
 was
 actually
 you
 know


five
 people
 who
 did
 a
 job
 and
 they
 found


hey
 I'm
 doing
 the
 same
 task
 all
 over


again
 and
 they
 had
 first
 of
 all
 the


courage
 to
 say
 you
 know
 I'm
 going
 out
 of


a
 well-
 paid
 job
 and
 I
 found
 SAP
 then


they
 had
 to
 find
 you
 know
 people
 who


finance
 them.
 That
 wasn't
 by
 far
 not


easy.
 They
 got
 a
 lot
 of,
 you
 know,
 nos


from
 many
 banks
 here
 in
 the
 region.
 And


then
 last
 but
 not
 least,
 they
 had
 an


idea,
 but
 then
 also
 they
 had
 to
 execute.


So
 they
 had
 the
 courage
 once
 again
 not


only
 to
 do
 business
 here
 in
 Germany,
 but


they
 also
 then
 risked,
 you
 know,
 to
 to


go
 to
 the
 US
 and
 in
 other
 places
 in
 the


world.
 And
 so
 when
 I
 look
 at
 this
 today


and
 why
 is
 this
 happening
 so
 often
 in


the
 US
 and
 not
 in
 Germany
 when
 you
 look


at
 in
 the
 Silicon
 Valley
 and
 uh
 I
 mean


there's
 often
 a
 talk
 why
 are
 there
 so


many
 you
 know
 successful
 tech
 companies


in
 this
 in
 the
 Silicon
 Valley
 I
 see


there
 is
 a
 piece
 there
 is
 great
 research


there
 are
 great
 universities
 but
 there


are
 also
 great
 companies
 and
 you
 know


when
 you
 see
 this
 in
 combination
 you


have
 great
 tech
 new
 tech
 coming
 you
 see


it
 you
 see
 it
 very
 early
 especially
 in


the
 Silicon
 Valley
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 smart


people
 figuring
 out
 where
 is
 the


technology
 going
 to,
 what
 are
 the
 techn


technological
 trends
 but
 then
 you
 also


have
 real
 world
 problems
 and
 when
 you


then
 bring
 this
 together
 business


research
 and
 universities
 this
 is
 you


know
 where
 great
 ideas
 you
 know
 are
 born


and
 then
 you
 of
 course
 have
 to
 have
 the


money
 to
 execute
 and
 have
 to
 have
 people


who
 are
 willing
 to
 finance
 you
 know
 this


new
 idea
 this
 startup
 yeah
 to
 scale
 and


that
 is
 of
 course
 also
 the
 ecosystem


there
 which
 makes
 it
 very
 very
 special


and
 here
 in
 Europe
 I
 mean
 look
 at
 that.


If
 you
 build
 now
 a
 startup
 in
 Germany,
 I


mean
 you
 have
 a
 certain
 size
 of
 a
 market


but
 then
 when
 you
 want
 to
 do
 business
 in


France
 or
 in
 Belgium
 or
 another
 or


Norway,
 you
 know
 there
 are
 different


regulations.
 You
 actually
 have
 to
 build


a
 different
 legal
 entity
 and
 that
 is


time
 and
 money
 what
 it
 costs
 you
 and


that
 is
 not
 good.
 Yeah.
 And
 that
 that's


why
 I
 would
 say
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 good


reasons
 to
 then
 to
 go
 to
 the
 US
 and


found
 your
 startup
 there
 before
 you


doing
 it
 in
 Europe.
 Absolutely.
 So


against
 this
 really
 difficult
 backdrop


which
 you
 just
 painted.
 Yes.
 If
 you
 were


to
 distill
 down
 why
 has
 SAP
 been
 so


successful?
 I
 would
 say
 first
 of
 all


five
 founders
 who
 had
 a
 great
 idea
 and


second
 to
 always
 have
 the
 courage
 to


transform.
 I
 mean
 there
 were
 many
 many


situations
 in
 SEP's
 history
 when
 you


know
 the
 CEOs
 or
 back
 then
 the
 founders


wouldn't
 have
 you
 know
 the
 willingness


to
 disrupt
 their
 own
 business
 model


their
 own
 technology.
 SAP
 would
 have


been
 yesterday's
 company.
 So
 it's
 also


about
 this
 constant
 transformation,
 this


willingness
 to
 disrupt
 your
 own


traditional
 business
 model
 and
 to
 move


on.
 Moving
 on
 to
 leadership.
 So
 you
 um


became
 the
 CEO
 before
 you
 turned
 40.


It's
 quite
 extraordinary.
 How
 was
 that?


I
 mean
 I
 look
 at
 my
 career
 at
 SAP
 and
 I


feel
 this
 is
 the
 strength
 of
 SAP.
 I
 mean


I
 started
 here
 as
 a
 student.
 Um
 and
 um


and
 since
 then
 I
 always
 had
 first
 of
 all


people
 mentors
 who
 actually
 you
 know


gave
 me
 a
 lot
 of
 knowledge
 who
 actually


gave
 me
 a
 platform
 to
 quot
 my
 career
 and


they
 gave
 me
 a
 lot
 of
 trust
 and


responsibility.
 I
 had
 my
 first
 team
 here


at
 SEP
 with
 seven
 people
 when
 I
 was
 you


know
 26
 27
 others
 are
 still
 at
 the


university
 and
 then
 you
 know
 I
 had
 the


the
 opportunity
 not
 to
 only
 see
 one
 part


of
 SAP.
 I
 mean
 we
 have
 here
 a
 big


internal
 job
 market.
 So
 the
 the
 ability


to
 rotate
 and
 seeing
 different
 parts
 of


the
 business
 is
 absolutely
 there
 and


that
 helped
 me
 a
 lot
 to
 not
 only
 have


great
 mentors
 but
 also
 then
 to
 learn


business
 end
 to
 end
 and
 then
 look
 at
 my


time
 at
 success
 factors.
 I
 was
 moving


from
 here
 to
 um
 San
 Mateo
 in
 in
 San


Francisco
 and
 I
 was
 able
 to
 help
 last


back
 in
 the
 days
 to
 one
 success
 factors


end
 to
 end.
 I
 mean
 I
 learned
 so
 much


yeah
 from
 you
 know
 closing
 deals
 doing


marketing
 into
 delivering
 software
 and


also
 then
 making
 sure
 the
 customers
 are


adopting
 the
 software
 and
 that
 was
 for


me
 of
 course
 you
 know
 better
 than
 every


you
 know
 learning
 course
 at
 the


university
 I
 saw
 real
 life
 how
 such
 a


company
 has
 to
 work
 and
 then
 of
 course


with
 my
 career
 you
 know
 really
 seeing


different
 parts
 of
 the
 company
 when
 I'm


sitting
 here
 today
 as
 a
 CEO
 I
 see


sometimes
 green
 lights
 you
 know
 in


certain
 meetings
 and
 I
 can
 still
 judge


hm
 Is
 this
 maybe
 too
 green
 or
 should


this
 not
 be
 more
 orange?
 And
 I
 don't


like
 orange.
 So,
 let's
 go
 to
 wet.
 It's


green
 or
 wet.
 We
 have
 a
 problem
 or
 not?


And
 and
 so
 I
 have,
 I
 guess,
 the
 ability


to
 charge,
 of
 course,
 not
 always
 to
 the


deepest
 level,
 but
 I
 have
 the
 ability
 to


judge,
 you
 know,
 are
 we
 going
 in
 the


right
 direction
 and
 are
 the
 pieces


really
 fitting
 together
 so
 that
 it
 works


end
 to
 end.
 How
 um
 was
 it
 to
 lead
 uh


people
 who
 were
 a
 lot
 older
 than
 you


when
 you
 were
 so
 young?
 Actually,
 I


didn't
 think
 so
 much
 about
 it.
 I
 always,


you
 know,
 wanted
 to
 convince
 people


about,
 you
 know,
 leadership,
 about


making
 decisions.
 Um,
 also
 convince
 them


about,
 you
 know,
 with
 knowledge
 and


expertise
 and
 and
 also,
 you
 know,


always,
 you
 know,
 be
 there
 to
 also
 help


them.
 Yeah.
 To
 do
 that
 job
 better.
 And
 I


guess
 when
 people
 feel
 that
 there
 is


someone
 who
 understands
 the
 business
 who


is
 also
 helping
 me
 you
 know
 in
 my
 own


career
 helping
 me
 you
 know
 to
 move
 on
 I


guess
 then
 you
 also
 you
 know
 create
 you


know
 the
 acceptance
 you
 need
 and
 then
 I


guess
 age
 doesn't
 matter
 so
 much
 and


here
 at
 SAP
 I
 would
 say
 we
 also
 have


that
 kind
 of
 culture
 that
 it's
 not
 a


matter
 of
 age
 it's
 really
 about
 you
 know


your
 own
 performance
 but
 also
 the
 way


how
 you
 adhere
 to
 our
 values
 and
 be
 able


to
 work
 in
 a
 team
 because
 here


everything
 you
 know
 once
 in
 projects.


There
 are
 not
 so
 many
 job
 profiles
 here


at
 SAP
 where
 you
 do
 where
 you
 are
 an


individual
 contributor.
 A
 lot
 of
 is


happening
 in
 teams
 in
 projects.
 Who
 have


been
 your
 important
 mentors?
 I
 mean
 uh


early
 in
 the
 days
 I
 mean
 there
 was
 of


course
 uh
 the
 the
 person
 who
 hired
 me


who
 gave
 me
 you
 know
 um
 you
 know
 a
 great


platform
 to
 to
 learn
 but
 then
 also
 to


said
 at
 one
 day
 he
 said
 hey
 why
 don't


you
 go
 to
 this
 executive
 board
 member


and
 present
 your
 stuff
 by
 yourself
 and


not
 me
 presenting
 it
 you
 know
 go
 there


and
 I
 give
 you
 the
 platform
 you
 know
 to


really
 show
 how
 how
 good
 you
 are
 and


what
 kind
 of
 work
 you're
 doing
 and
 that


helped
 a
 lot
 and
 then
 I
 was
 of
 Of
 course


with
 G
 Oswald,
 he
 was
 a
 long-standing


board
 member
 here.
 He
 teached
 me
 a
 lot


about,
 you
 know,
 not
 so
 much
 care
 about


so
 much
 internal
 stuff,
 but
 really
 focus


on
 customers.
 He
 was
 responsible
 for


service
 and
 support.
 So
 I
 learned
 it
 the


hard
 way
 also
 how
 missionritical
 our


software
 is.
 And
 he
 always
 told
 me,


Christian,
 no matter
 if
 you're
 in


finance
 and
 service
 and
 support,
 always


understand
 our
 products
 and
 our


customers
 business.
 Then
 I
 had
 last


Algard
 um
 you
 know
 as
 um
 you
 know
 CEO
 of


success
 factor
 who
 founded
 this


beautiful
 company.
 I
 had
 Jim
 Sna


completely
 different
 personality.
 He
 was


running
 development.
 So
 I
 was
 running


deaf
 operations
 for
 him.
 So
 I
 learned
 a


lot
 about
 you
 know
 how
 to
 connect


business
 with
 technology
 was
 very


important.
 And
 then
 I
 guess
 the
 most


important
 time
 in
 my
 career
 was
 when


Bill
 McDermad
 asked
 me
 to
 become
 the


chief
 operating
 officer.
 And
 because
 um


four
 CEOs
 before
 all
 failed
 and
 I
 said


to
 Bill,
 you
 know,
 Bill,
 I
 don't
 want
 to


be
 the
 fifth
 one
 failing
 here.
 I
 want
 to


still
 build
 a
 great
 career
 at
 SAP.
 Can


you
 do
 me
 a
 favor?
 Um
 it
 is
 great,
 but
 I


need
 businesses.
 I
 need
 business


processes
 and
 I
 need
 data.
 Otherwise,


you
 know,
 it
 is
 can
 only
 be,
 you
 know,


less
 impactful,
 but
 I
 need,
 you
 know,


the
 business
 systems
 and
 data.
 And
 so
 he


gave
 me
 also
 then
 you
 know
 this


opportunity
 to
 become
 the
 chief


operating
 officer
 and
 there
 you
 know
 I


learned
 how
 hard
 it
 is
 to
 transform
 a


company.
 It's
 not
 only
 about
 tech
 and


that's
 what
 I'm
 also
 now
 telling
 our


customers
 today
 as
 a
 CEO.
 I
 said
 hey
 SAP


can
 be
 way
 more
 for
 you
 than
 only


implementing
 a
 new
 tech
 a
 new
 solution
 a


new
 ERP.
 We
 need
 to
 be
 part
 of
 your


business
 transformation
 because
 then
 the


tech
 can
 unfold
 immense
 value.
 AI
 can


unfold
 immense
 value.
 You
 can
 buy
 a


yacht
 or
 a
 lot
 of
 AI.
 You
 have
 a
 big


problem
 now.
 Who
 do
 you
 approach?
 Who
 do


you
 ask?
 Actually
 when
 I
 have
 a
 big


problem
 now
 I
 mean
 I
 have
 my
 executive


board
 colleagues
 and
 which
 I
 trust
 a
 lot


and
 you
 know
 many
 of
 them
 I
 really
 ask


for
 an
 advice
 be
 you
 know
 Sebastian


Stein
 as
 head
 of
 strategy
 is
 now
 our


CEO.
 I
 go
 to
 him
 and
 then
 we
 have
 a
 cup


of
 coffee
 and
 think
 about
 you
 know
 the


strategy
 strategy
 to
 execution
 what
 does


work
 well
 what
 does
 not
 work
 so
 well
 and


then
 the
 same
 is
 with
 with
 my
 other
 all


all
 other
 bot
 colleagues
 I'm
 the
 one
 who


and
 what
 about
 outside
 the
 company
 who


do
 you
 outside
 of
 the
 company
 I
 would


still
 say
 I
 have
 a
 good
 relationship


still
 to
 last
 you
 know
 a
 former
 mentor
 I


have
 um
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 coaches
 who


also
 help
 me
 on
 you
 know
 how
 to
 deal


with
 complex
 topics
 how
 to
 do
 problem


solving
 etc
 so
 I
 have
 a
 few
 people
 there


and
 then
 of
 course
 you
 know
 when
 you


talk
 to
 Saja
 Nadella
 when
 you
 talk
 to


Shondanu
 from
 Adobe
 etc.
 I
 mean
 we
 talk


about
 business
 just
 doing
 a
 little
 plug


here
 we
 have
 had
 them
 both
 on
 the
 on
 the


podcast
 so
 so
 the
 listeners
 should


especially
 when
 I
 became
 you
 know
 I
 was


38
 when
 I
 became
 the
 CEO
 I
 mean
 often


times
 I
 at
 where
 we
 especially
 at
 the


beginning
 I
 asked
 them
 for
 advice
 I
 said


they
 are
 they
 are
 both
 uh
 Indian
 is


there
 something
 with
 the
 Indian


leadership
 that
 you
 admire
 or
 try
 to


replicate?
 M
 look
 I
 mean
 what
 I
 see
 in


both
 of
 these
 gentlemen
 I
 see
 that
 Satya


and
 Chandanu
 first
 of
 all
 understand
 the


business
 inside
 out
 Satya
 also
 started


his
 career
 at
 Microsoft
 very
 early
 and


when
 I
 talk
 to
 him
 I
 mean
 he
 understands


you
 know
 product
 commercials
 where's
 the


market
 going
 to
 he
 has
 a
 super
 creative


mindset
 on
 how
 to
 bring
 all
 of
 these


pieces
 together
 but
 they're
 also
 quite


humble
 right
 they're
 also
 quite
 humble


yes
 indeed
 and
 I
 would
 actually
 say
 this


is
 also
 very
 important
 As
 I
 also
 tell


the
 people
 here,
 I
 mean
 it's
 great
 about


the
 share
 price
 but
 at
 the
 end
 you
 know


next
 day
 you
 have
 to
 deserve
 you
 know


the
 the
 white
 to
 actually
 you
 know
 serve


your
 customers
 better
 and
 that
 is
 you


know
 at
 the
 end
 this
 humbleness
 what
 you


need
 to
 not
 only
 become
 successful
 but


also
 to
 stay
 successful.
 Is
 there
 such
 a


thing
 as
 a
 German
 leadership
 style?


Um
 I
 would
 say
 you
 know
 the
 Germans
 when


I
 look
 at
 the
 German
 leadership
 style
 I


mean
 we
 have
 our
 processes
 we
 have


regulations.
 Am
 I
 now
 a
 typical
 German?


I
 mean
 I
 sometimes
 you
 know
 try
 to
 ask


to
 get
 bureaucracy
 out.
 Yeah.
 But
 I
 see


this
 as
 a
 typical
 German
 thing
 which
 is


on
 one
 thing
 as
 strengths.
 Yeah.
 when
 it


comes
 to
 you
 know
 organizing
 supply


chain
 one
 supply
 chain
 one
 manufacturing


you
 need
 to
 have
 this
 you
 know
 kind
 of


passion
 for
 the
 details
 but
 you
 also


need
 to
 be
 careful
 that
 you
 are
 not


overregulating
 so
 much
 yeah
 there
 is


there
 is
 somewhere
 a
 borderline
 which


you
 shouldn't
 cross
 because
 then
 your


strengths
 can
 also
 become
 your
 biggest


weakness
 what
 have
 you
 learned
 from


being
 on
 the
 board
 of
 Adidas
 with
 our


fellow
 Norwegian


oh
 yes
 yes yes
 um
 he's
 also
 a
 humble
 guy


And
 uh
 what
 I
 what
 I
 when
 I
 look
 at
 Bern


I
 mean
 he
 he
 wants
 to
 be
 close
 to
 his


retailers.
 He
 wants
 to
 be
 close
 to
 the


people
 wanting
 the
 supply
 chain.
 And
 I


guess
 that
 is
 what
 a
 CEO
 is
 also
 about


to
 not
 sit
 at
 the
 top
 in
 your
 ivory


tower
 and
 you
 know
 see
 this
 is
 my


strategy
 and
 uh
 so
 but
 really
 coming


down
 and
 say
 hey
 what
 are
 the
 needs
 you


know
 of
 my
 different
 stakeholders
 and


then
 act
 based
 on
 those.
 And
 then
 the


second
 based
 on
 Adidas
 it's
 a
 different


industry
 but
 of
 course
 you
 know


marketing
 brand
 heat
 you


know
 matters
 a
 lot
 and
 that
 is
 of
 course


certain
 things
 what
 I
 can
 also
 take
 out


for
 for
 SAP
 despite
 we
 are
 different


industry
 supply
 chains
 co
 it
 was
 very


interesting
 how
 adidas
 build
 a
 very


resilient
 supply
 chain
 and
 how
 can
 tech


can
 help
 so
 out
 of
 this
 mandate
 I
 also


take
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 know
 input
 for
 our


technology
 on
 to
 how
 to
 help
 you
 know


such
 companies
 to
 one
 even
 better
 with


our
 technology
 because
 you
 are
 sitting


in
 the
 board
 and
 you
 see
 you
 know
 what


is
 working
 well
 and
 where
 do
 they
 need


help.
 Why
 do
 some
 cos
 have
 execution


power?
 Why
 do
 some
 people
 get
 things


done?
 You
 mentioned
 that
 you
 were
 number


five
 you
 know
 in
 a
 particular
 job
 and


you
 you
 managed
 to
 do
 it.
 Yeah,
 I
 would


say
 um
 you
 know
 people
 when
 you
 would


ask
 people
 you
 know
 surrounding
 me,
 they


would
 probably
 say
 Christian
 can
 be


sometimes
 a
 bit


impatient
 and
 wants
 to
 do
 decisions


sometimes
 maybe
 a
 bit
 too
 fast
 but
 I'm


more
 acting
 and
 managing
 based
 on
 the


principle
 I
 rather
 do
 you
 know
 10


decisions
 a
 day
 and
 eight
 are
 great
 and


two
 are
 wrong
 and
 I'm
 the
 last
 person


who
 says
 you
 know
 what
 this
 decision
 was


absolutely
 not
 great
 by
 Christian
 let's


revert
 this
 decision
 it
 was
 not
 good
 so


I
 you
 know
 let's
 course
 correct
 it
 but


then
 I
 get
 something
 done
 and
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 when
 I
 leave
 and
 go
 to
 home
 I


the
 thing
 what
 I
 don't
 hate
 what
 I


really
 hate
 is
 I
 was
 sitting
 in
 10


steering
 committee
 spend
 the
 whole
 day


here
 in
 Waldorf
 and
 I
 have
 to
 feel
 I
 got


nothing
 done
 do
 you
 micromanage
 I


micromanage
 you
 know
 that
 is
 a
 point


yeah
 which
 I
 got
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 blame


for
 in
 my
 early
 years
 I
 have
 have
 to
 You


know
 when
 I
 micromanage,
 I
 micromanage


when
 I
 feel
 things
 are
 not
 going
 well.


Yes.
 Then
 Christian
 can
 really
 go
 deep


and
 want
 to
 understand
 the
 problem.
 But


is
 this
 now
 necessarily
 a
 bad
 thing?
 But


I
 also
 have
 to
 tell
 you
 things
 which
 are


one
 in
 crate.
 I'm
 actually
 so
 happy
 to


also
 cancel
 a
 meeting
 that
 said
 you
 know


what
 today
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 talk
 about


that
 because
 it's
 one
 and
 I
 see
 it
 in


the
 numbers
 the
 facts
 the
 customers


everyone
 is
 telling
 me
 fantastic.
 So
 you


know
 you
 I
 give
 you
 some
 time
 back.
 You


rather
 focus
 on
 other
 stuff.
 you
 don't


have
 to
 spend
 the
 time
 with
 me.
 How
 do


you
 give
 feedback?
 Are
 you
 a
 straight


feedback
 giver?
 Yeah.
 But
 this
 is
 a
 is
 a


big
 big
 risk
 in
 this
 job.
 I
 sometimes


feel
 people
 you
 know
 have
 so
 much


respect.
 Yeah.
 They
 are
 we
 actually
 you


know
 concerned
 about
 giving
 you
 open


feedback
 and
 so
 sometimes
 I
 sit
 in


meetings
 I
 said
 hey
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 be


so
 polite
 and
 saying
 only
 so
 many
 polish


things
 to
 me.
 Tell
 me
 are
 you
 agree
 with


me
 or
 not?
 And
 if
 you
 don't
 agree
 it's


absolutely
 right
 but
 please
 tell
 it
 to


me
 now
 because
 now
 we
 are
 making
 a
 very


important
 decision
 and
 it's
 absolutely


fair
 to
 say
 no
 the
 CEO
 maybe
 you
 know


has
 you
 know
 a
 different
 opinion
 than
 I


and
 so
 I
 constantly
 also
 first
 of
 all


challenge
 myself
 to
 you
 know
 to
 come


across
 as
 you
 know
 please
 give
 me
 this


feedback
 and
 not
 running
 into
 a
 meeting


and
 speak
 up
 you
 know
 first
 and
 then


dominating
 the
 whole
 meeting
 because


then
 you
 can
 you
 know
 wonder
 why
 you're


not
 getting
 feedback
 but
 it's
 not


surprise
 but
 then
 also
 you
 know


encouraging
 others
 to
 speak
 up
 and
 I


guess
 this
 is
 very
 very
 important
 that


you
 facilitate
 that
 kind
 of
 culture


what's
 the
 part
 of
 uh
 SAP
 corporate


culture
 which
 you
 try
 to
 change
 yeah


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 talk
 these
 days
 about


performance
 management
 and
 um
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 talk
 about
 you
 know
 indeed
 this


micro
 micromanagement
 and
 giving
 more


freedom
 to
 our
 people
 and
 I
 guess
 it
 got


a
 lot
 better
 but
 you
 know
 the
 thing
 what


I
 want
 to
 actually
 facilitate
 especially


you
 know
 here
 in
 in
 in
 in
 Germany
 in


Europe
 is
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 you
 can
 always


say
 around
 you
 know
 what


is
 good
 or
 bad
 around
 you
 know
 US
 labor


laws
 and
 so
 on
 I
 don't
 even
 want
 to
 go


there
 but
 I'm
 actually
 convinced
 that
 in


order
 to
 stay
 at
 the
 top
 of
 an
 industry


and
 be
 a
 market
 leader
 you
 need
 a
 kind


of
 performance
 culture
 and
 performance


culture
 is
 not
 about
 every
 year
 kicking


10%
 of
 the
 people
 out
 it's
 about
 you


know
 what
 I'm
 as
 a
 manager
 need
 to
 be


able
 to
 sit
 here
 together
 with
 you
 and


give
 you
 constructive
 feedback
 about


what
 was
 great
 and
 what
 was
 not
 so
 great


because
 in
 my
 career
 especially
 the


things
 which
 were
 not
 so
 great
 helped
 me


to
 get
 better.
 I
 mean
 how
 often
 did


chimna
 tell
 me
 you
 know what
 Christian


in
 this
 meeting
 first
 I
 didn't
 feel
 very


well
 prepared
 there
 was
 a
 certain
 piece


missing
 and
 also
 the
 way
 how
 you


argumented
 you
 didn't
 come
 straight
 to


the
 point
 and
 I
 said
 oh
 yeah
 I
 felt
 the


same
 now
 but
 now
 that
 you're
 saying
 to


me
 it's
 good
 now
 I
 can
 go
 back
 and
 think


about
 it
 and
 do
 it
 better
 next
 time
 but


this
 ability
 is
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 lost


and
 that
 is
 something
 what
 I
 want
 to


facilitate
 so
 this
 performance
 feedback


this
 connotation
 to
 Oh,
 do
 we
 want
 to


get
 rid
 of
 people?
 No,
 no,
 no,
 no.
 I'm
 a


big
 believer
 that
 performance
 culture
 is


first
 of
 all
 matters
 for
 your
 high


performers
 so
 that
 they
 see
 when
 they


walk
 the
 extra
 mile
 and
 perform
 that


they
 really
 feel
 rewarded.
 But
 it's
 also


for
 the
 people
 who
 are
 still
 new
 in
 a


job
 that
 they
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 get


better.
 And
 of
 course,
 it's
 also
 then
 a


thing
 that
 you
 also
 understand,
 hey,
 SAP


is
 really
 looking
 for
 performance.
 It's


also
 not
 okay
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 team


when
 you're
 just
 sitting
 around
 and
 you


know
 doing
 your
 job
 uh
 you
 know
 in
 a
 in


a
 way
 that
 you
 know
 you're
 just
 you
 know


pulling
 the
 your
 task
 activities
 to


others
 in
 the
 team.
 Yeah.
 Do
 you
 think


um
 the
 lack
 of
 um


uh
 kind
 of
 compar
 competitive
 spirit
 and


um
 performance
 culture?
 Do
 you
 think


it's
 a
 function
 of
 where
 Europe
 is
 now?


you
 know
 a
 bit
 more
 bureaucratic
 more


rules
 more
 uh
 security


safety
 it's
 not
 easy
 to
 implement
 in
 in


this
 part
 of
 the
 world
 right
 I


absolutely
 do
 I
 mean
 look
 when
 I
 um
 I


mean
 I
 see
 it
 you
 know
 actually
 also
 and


when
 I
 look
 at
 my
 kids
 I
 mean
 do
 I


always
 tell
 them
 don't
 climb
 up
 here
 the


cherry
 tree
 no
 I
 mean
 climb
 up
 but
 you


know
 I'm
 of
 course
 still
 watching
 but


I'm
 not
 the
 one
 who
 says
 hey
 when
 you


don't
 take
 any
 risks
 you
 know
 how
 does


this
 further
 you
 in
 your
 career
 later


when
 you
 take
 zero
 risk
 I'm
 I'm


convinced
 you're
 also
 limiting
 yourself


and
 I
 mean
 there's
 of
 course
 a
 topic


like
 compliance
 you
 the
 compliance
 is


super
 important
 you
 always
 should
 stay


compliant
 but
 there's
 a
 big
 difference


of
 not
 taking
 any
 kind
 of
 risk
 and
 I


guess
 here
 in
 Europe
 I
 really
 feel
 we


also
 need
 to
 educate
 especially
 already


in
 in
 in
 school
 in
 the
 university
 that


risk
 takingaking
 is
 absolutely
 something


what
 you
 have
 to
 do
 in
 order
 to
 succeed


yeah
 because
 you
 know
 when
 I
 look
 at
 my


compet
 competitors
 around
 there.
 I
 mean


of
 course
 every
 decision
 you
 do,
 every


investment
 decision,
 every
 portfolio


decision
 you
 do,
 there
 is
 some
 risk
 into


it.
 I
 could
 sit
 here
 the
 whole
 day
 and


say
 you
 know
 what
 we
 don't
 transform.


Actually
 it's
 great
 SAP
 is
 you
 know
 here


at
 a
 certain
 level
 we
 stop
 our


transformation
 and
 we
 just
 stay
 where
 we


are.
 That
 would
 be
 probably
 the
 way
 of


where
 I
 would
 get,
 you
 know,
 much
 less


resistance
 here
 and
 there,
 much
 less


criticism,
 but
 it
 would
 be
 100%
 the
 one


thing
 for
 this
 company
 to
 just
 stay


where
 we
 are
 because
 tech
 is
 moving


fast,
 AI
 is
 moving
 fast.
 So,
 we
 have
 to


continue
 to
 transform.
 Question,
 how
 do


you
 relax?
 Relax?
 Um,
 actually,
 I
 I
 love


to
 ski.
 Uh,
 I
 really
 love
 to
 ski.
 I
 love


the
 mountains.
 um
 both
 in
 even
 more
 in


winter
 but
 also
 in
 the
 summer
 when
 you


don't
 have
 always
 your
 mobile
 with
 you


and
 that
 is
 for
 me
 great
 with
 the
 family


with
 friends
 and
 then
 of
 course
 you
 know


I
 have
 my
 sauna
 where
 I
 can
 you
 know
 do


you
 know
 also
 spend
 a
 bit
 time
 for
 me
 I


guess
 it's
 also
 very
 important
 I
 love


the
 family
 but
 sometimes
 it's
 also
 to


come
 down
 and
 to
 digest
 what
 happened
 in


the
 day
 and
 to
 think
 a
 little
 bit


broader
 about
 the
 world
 and
 everything


what
 is
 happening
 on
 the
 geopolitical


side
 that
 is
 also
 some
 time
 which
 is


very
 very
 important
 for
 me
 to
 come
 down.


So
 we
 interviewed
 100
 leaders
 you
 are


the
 first
 one
 who
 mentioned
 a
 sona
 so


perhaps
 perhaps
 you
 have
 a
 fin
 inside


you
 or
 something
 because
 I
 I
 do
 sona
 you


know
 probably
 five
 times
 a
 week
 I


actually
 can
 almost
 compete
 with
 you
 on


that
 one.
 Yeah.
 So
 I
 you
 know
 often


times
 when
 I
 do
 my
 US
 calls
 in
 the


evening
 uh
 and
 it's
 then
 around
 9
 10
 in


the
 evening
 I
 turn
 on
 the
 sound
 now
 not


during
 the
 call
 but
 I
 already
 turn
 on


the
 sona
 and
 then
 I
 hop
 in
 you
 know


before
 I
 go
 to
 to
 to
 bed
 or
 you
 know
 I


I'm
 I'm
 a
 big
 I'm
 I
 really
 really
 love


it
 and
 it's
 a
 good
 way
 for
 me
 to
 come


down
 and
 relax.
 What
 do
 you
 read?
 What


do
 I
 read?
 Uh
 I
 read
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 know


of
 course
 you
 know
 business
 newspapers.


I
 lead
 a
 lot
 of
 research.
 I
 love


research.
 I
 sometimes
 tell
 my
 co,
 give


me
 the
 latest
 research
 on
 knowledge


graphs.
 Give
 me
 the
 latest
 re
 research


on
 vector
 engines,
 etc.
 Because
 I'm
 now


not
 the
 deepest
 technologist.
 But
 what
 I


love
 about
 this
 research
 is
 what
 do
 you


like
 about
 vector
 engines?
 But
 vector


engines,
 I
 mean
 the
 point
 is
 when
 you


look
 at,
 you
 know,
 AI
 and
 you
 need
 to,


you
 know,
 have
 now
 structured
 and


unstructured
 content.
 The
 power
 of
 AI
 is


to
 bring
 those
 two
 together
 and
 the


vector
 engine
 is
 actually
 a
 very
 very


important
 piece
 in
 that
 under


lastly.
 What
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 young


people?
 My
 advice
 to
 young
 people
 is
 um


stay


humble,
 never
 stop
 learning,
 be
 always


curious.
 uh
 it's
 it's
 that
 is
 for
 me
 I


mean
 in
 my
 career
 that
 was
 really
 really


important
 and
 then
 at
 the
 end
 yeah


you
 also
 understand
 that
 you
 know
 when


you
 want
 to
 build
 a
 great
 career
 and
 you


you
 know
 want
 to
 come
 in
 a
 position


where
 you
 have
 you
 know
 also
 higher
 in


the
 wanks
 you
 know
 also
 you
 know
 hard


work
 and
 I
 mean
 that's
 also
 part
 of
 the


truth
 you
 need
 to
 you
 know
 deliver


outcomes
 but
 you
 also
 have
 to
 also
 be


open
 and
 and
 honest
 to
 yourself
 that
 it


also
 requires
 that
 it's
 not
 a
 9
 to5
 job.


Yeah.
 Well,
 Christian,
 you
 clearly


worked
 very
 hard
 and
 I
 would
 say
 you


have
 stayed
 surprisingly
 humble
 given


that
 you're
 a
 young
 person
 running
 the


biggest
 company
 in
 Europe.
 Well
 done.


Thanks
 a
 lot,
 Nikolai.
 Yeah,
 thanks
 a


lot.
