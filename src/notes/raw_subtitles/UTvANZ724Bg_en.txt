CHARLIE. THE S&P 500 DOWN BY 1.9
PERCENT, OFF THE WORST LEVELS
OF THE DAY, DOWN AS MUCH AS 2%
EARLIER IN THE SESSION.
ERIC WEINER IS SENIOR EDITOR OF
EQUITIES AMERICAS FOR BLOOMBERG
NEWS JOINING US IN THE STUDIO.
WHEN YOU ARE ON OUR PROGRAM
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT IS
BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING
VOLATILITY AND TODAY IS NO
EXCEPTION.
WE SAW STOCKS LOWER OVER
CONCERNS OF AN ESCALATING TRADE
WAR WITH CHINA.
HOW IS TODAY DIFFERENT THAN
RHETORIC WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE
PAST FEW MONTHS? ERIC:
CHINA IS THE TIP OF THE MISSILE
ON TARIFF.
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID WE WILL
MASSIVELY RAISE TARIFFS ON
CHINA AND BASICALLY UNSPOOL
THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT RARE
EARTH WE KNEW IMMEDIATELY THE
MARKET WOULD TURN AND,
PROBABLY, GET PRETTY UGLY.
THE QUESTION BECOMES WHAT THIS
ACTUALLY MEANS.
LOOK AT WHERE THE MARKET WAS.
PRETTY COFFEE.
THINGS WERE GETTING TO THE
POINT WHERE PEOPLE ON WALL
STREET WERE WONDERING HOW MUCH
FURTHER IT COULD GO.
THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO
STEP IN AND BE LIKE, LET'S PULL
SOME STUFF OFF THE TABLE.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS OVER THE
WEEKEND AND GO FROM THERE.
THE QUESTION IS WHERE WE GO AT
THE END OF THE TRADING SESSION
AND NEXT WEEK.
IF THIS CONTINUES AND STICKS
AROUND, THINGS COULD GET UGLY.
EMILY:
WE HAVE A TECH STOCKS MOVING
LOWER, THE MOST RISK ON PARTS
OF THE MARKET SELLING OFF IN
THE WORST WAY TODAY.
WHAT DOES THIS TELL US ABOUT
WHERE WE COULD GO NEXT? ERIC:
WHEN YOU SEE THE INDEX MOVE
LIKE THIS, THE S&P 500 MOVED
LIKE THIS, EVEN THOUGH, YES,
THERE ARE 400 STOCKS THAT ARE
DOWN THERE ARE 15 YOU ARE
REALLY LOOKING OUT BECAUSE THE
THING IS SO CONCENTRATED.
THE RISK IS IN THOSE BIG TECH
NAMES THAT REALLY, REALLY DROVE
THE EQUITY INDEX MUCH HIGHER.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, YOU ARE
LIKE OK.
WE WILL TAKE SOME PROFITS OUT
OF FACEBOOK.
WE WILL TAKE SOME PROFITS OUT
OF NVIDIA.
WE WILL GO FROM THERE.
BUT, WHEN YOU SAW THE VIX JUMP
OVER 20, THAT IS WHEN TRADERS
START GETTING CAUTIOUS,
GENERALLY.
THERE ARE TWO THINGS GOING ON.
BUT -- OF THE BREADTH OF THE
DECLINE AND THESE THINGS COMING
OUT. TIM:
WE ARE ONLY OFF 2% OF ALL TIME
HIGHS, YES, THE WORST DATE FOR
THE S&P 500 SINCE APRIL 21, BUT
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LEVEL WE ARE
AT NOW, IT IS THE LEVEL IT HAS
BEEN SINCE SEPTEMBER 25.
SO WE ARE BASICALLY GO -- GOING
BACK IN TIME TWO WEEKS. MICHAEL:
EXACTLY.
THAT IS WHAT I MEAN BY, WE
DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING
RIGHT NOW.
YOU TALK ABOUT, WE ARE GOING TO
MASSIVELY INCREASE TARIFFS ON
CHINESE GOODS.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHO GETS IT?
THERE IS NOT A LOT OF
DISCERNING TRADING GOING ON.
IT IS, LET'S GET OUT OF THESE
POSITIONS.
IT IS A GOOD EXCUSE TO TAKE
PROFITS.
IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL RISK AND
WHAT IS GOING ON, WE HAVE NOT
HAD A 2% DROP.
THE MARKET HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY
CALM.
WE HAVE NOT HAD A 2% DROP SINCE
APRIL OR 1% DROP SINCE AUGUST 1.
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS
WHERE, WHY NOT GET OUT OF HERE
NOW AND SEE WHERE WE COME BACK
NEXT WEEK?
BECAUSE THE MARKET HAS BOUGHT
EVERY DIP.
AT IS WHAT WE ARE BETTING ON
FROM HERE.
THAT INVESTORS WILL COME IN AND
BE LIKE, THERE WAS A SALE.
LET'S SCOOP STUFF UP STARTING
MONDAY. EMILY:
WHAT WOULD YOU NEED TO SEE IN
THE MARKET TO SAY THIS WILL NOT
BE ANOTHER DIP THAT WILL BE
BOUGHT?
MORE DECLINES MONDAY, TUESDAY,
WEDNESDAY?
A CERTAIN SECTOR SELLING OFF?
WHAT WOULD REALLY GENERATE
CONCERNS HERE THE RALLY WOULD
NOT BE SUSTAINED?
MICHAEL:
WHEN YOU SEE IT START TO BECOME
REALLY BROAD-BASED.
WE LOOK AT THE TWO MEASURES OF
THE S&P 500, EQUAL WEIGHT AND
REGULAR.
THE EQUAL WEIGHTED VERSION
MEANS THERE IS A LOT MORE
BREADTH.
YOU CAN SEE WHAT IS GOING ON.
RIGHT NOW THE S&P 500 IS
PERFORMING WAY WORSE THAN THE
EQUAL WEIGHTED VERSION OF THAT.
THAT WILL FLIP.
IF THAT GETS UGLY, IF THE S&P
500, IF THE EQUAL WEIGHTED
VERSION COMES DOWN WITH THE
REGULAR VERSION, THEN YOU START
THINKING, WOW, AND IT STARTS
HOLDING BECAUSE WE NEED TO SEE
IT HAPPEN A COUPLE WEEKS FOR
THIS TO GO ON.
THEN YOU START THINKING, MAYBE
WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING SOME
REPRICING.
BUT I REALLY WANT TO STRESS WE
AREN'T SEEING THAT RIGHT NOW.
TIM:
ERIC WEINER, THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US HERE IN THE
BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK STUDIO.
DON'T GO FAR.
WE WILL BE CALLING YOU BACK
LATER TODAY.
I WANT TO BRING IN MICHAEL
MCKEE JOINING US IN THE
BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK STUDIO.
AS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT,
MARKETS LOWER ON FEARS OF AN
ESCALATING TRADE WAR.
YOU ARE A MACRO GUY,
INTERNATIONAL POLICY
CORRESPONDED.
IT'S THIS RETHINKING U.S.
TRADE POLICY?
IT IS JUST A SOCIAL MEDIA POST.
MICHAEL:
THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS GOING
ON AND ERIC IS RIGHT THE
MARKETS ARE USING THIS AS AN
EXCUSE TO SELL OFF BECAUSE WE
DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WILL
HAPPEN.
THE CHINESE HAVE SAID THEY WILL
PUT NEW RESTRICTIONS ON RARE
EARTH, SUPER MAGNETS, AND
THINGS LIKE THAT TO THAT HAVE
BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION.
SHE AND TRUMP ARE SUPPOSED TO
BE AT AIPAC LATER THIS MONTH TO
TALK ABOUT THIS.
THERE WAS THOUGHT THEY MIGHT
REACH SOME KIND OF DEAL.
SOME ANALYSTS THINK THIS IS
BASICALLY THE CHINESE TRYING TO
GET SOME NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE.
DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT WANT TO
BE BACKED INTO A CORNER.
SO, HE IS NEGOTIATING BACK IN
THE KIND OF LANGUAGE HE TENDS
TO USE.
THE MAIN BODY OF THE CHINESE
NEW RESTRICTIONS WOULD NOT HIT
UNTIL NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER.
SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT
IS EMINENT.
IT COULD BE THIS IS JUST ALL
POSTURING AND ONE HAS TO HOPE
THAT AT THIS POINT.
BUT, THAT MIGHT BE WHY WE HAVE
A ROUGHLY 2% FALL AND NOTHING
WORSE.
I THINK IF THE PRESIDENT HAD
REALLY CAME OUT AND SAID, I
WANT TO JACK UP THESE TARIFFS
TO 50%, 60%, 70%, YOU WOULD SEE
A BIGGER REACTION. EMILY:
HE IS SET TO MEET WITH CHINESE
PRESIDENT XI JINPING A LITTLE
LATER THIS MONTH.
HAVE WE HEARD DETAILS ABOUT
WHETHER THAT MEETING WILL STILL
BE TAKING PLACE?
MICHAEL:
THE CHINESE HAVE NOT SAID THAT
IT IS OFF.
THE PRESIDENT SAID I DON'T SEE
A REASON TO MEET RIGHT NOW, BUT
HE DID NOT SAY HE'S NOT GOING
TO. WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW
THIS PLAYS OUT OVER THE NEXT
COUPLE DAYS.
MAYBE HE IS MAD BECAUSE OF THE
NOBEL PRIZE AND INSTEAD OF
GOING AFTER NORWAY LIKE WE ALL
THOUGHT HE WOULD THIS MORNING.
TIM: BUT HE WAS THANKED BY THE
WINNER OF THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.
>> SHE SAID, WE ARE COUNTING ON
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OUR FRIENDS
IN DEMOCRACIES AROUND THE WORLD
TO CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE FOR
VENEZUELA. TIM:
LET'S TALK ABOUT REDUCTIONS IN
FORCE, THE IDEA OF PERMANENT
LAYOFFS.
RUSS VOUGHT EARLIER TODAY, THE
WHITE HOUSE BUDGET DIRECTOR
SAID THAT THE REDUCTIONS IN
WORKFORCE HAVE BEGUN.
HE IS REFERRING TO THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT TERM FOR LAYOFFS
HERE. DO WE KNOW HOW MANY?
DO WE KNOW WHO?
DO WE KNOW WHERE?
MICHAEL: A SENIOR WHITE HOUSE
REPRESENTATIVE TOLD BLOOMBERG
IT WOULD BE THOUSANDS.
A REPRESENTATIVE FOR STATE AND
LOCAL EMPLOYEES SAID THEY HEARD
1300.
THERE IS NO EXACT NUMBER AT
THIS POINT.
IT DOES SEEM TO BE AFFECTING
MANY AGENCIES, I HAVE HEARD
MAYBE AS MANY AS NINE.
OBVIOUSLY, THIS WILL PROVOKE
LAWSUITS FROM THE FEDERAL
UNIONS.
THE ADMINISTRATION AND RUSS
VOUGHT SAY THIS IS NECESSARY
BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT
SHUTDOWN, BUT IT'S NOT.
THEY HAVE NEVER DONE THIS
BEFORE.
IT IS ALSO THEATER.
NOW, DOES -- THE ADMINISTRATION
COULD BE SETTING THIS UP AS A
BARGAINING CHIP.
DEMOCRATS COME TO THE TABLE AND
CONCEDE SOMETHING AND THE
PRESIDENT SAYS, ALL RIGHT, WE
WON'T FIRE THESE PEOPLE.
REMEMBER HOW ALL OF THIS WENT
WITH THE WILLIE DARBY THING.
PEOPLE WERE ON THE PAYROLL, OFF
THE PAYROLL, ON THE PAYROLL
AGAIN. THIS COULD ALSO BE A BIG
SMOKESCREEN.
EMILY:
HOW DOES THAT IMPACT WHAT COULD
BE AN ALREADY WEAK LABOR MARKET?
WE HAD GOVERNOR CHRISTOPHER
WALLER FROM THE FED SAYING JOB
GROWTH HAS BEEN NEGATIVE THE
LAST FEW MONTHS, THE LABOR
MARKET IS HIS BIGGEST CONCERN.
THIS IS ALSO WHAT WE HAVE HEARD
FROM JEROME POWELL.
THESE FIRINGS.
WOULDN'T THAT MAKE THE LABOR
MARKET EVEN WEAKER OR IS IT NOT
QUITE RELATED?
MICHAEL:
AT THIS POINT, IF YOU SAID
THOUSANDS, THERE ARE SOMETHING
LIKE 2 MILLION FEDERAL
EMPLOYEES, SO IT WOULDN'T MEAN
THAT MANY PEOPLE ENOUGH TO
AFFECT THE ECONOMY, BUT IT DOES
CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL SENSE
THAT THE COUNTRY IS NOT DOING
WELL, THAT THE ECONOMY IS NOT
DOING WELL, AND THAT MIGHT HIT
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE.
THE MORE LAYOFFS YOU HAVE IN
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, THE MORE YOU
START TO WORRY ABOUT THAT AND
CUT BACK ON SPENDING AND THAT
IS HOW RECESSIONS BEGIN,
BASICALLY, AS A CONFIDENCE
MATTER.
IT'S NOT GOOD NEWS, BUT IT'S
NOT SOMETHING WE WILL REALLY
SEE IN THE ECONOMY.
WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING WITH
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS IS
SPENDING IS DELAYED, BUT NOT
COMPLETELY GONE.
PEOPLE WILL GET THEIR BACKPAY
PAY, IN THEORY.
THE LAW SAYS THEY GET PAID.
THEN THEY WILL GO MAKE THE
IMPORTANT PAYMENTS THEY HAVE TO
MAKE AND I AM SURE THEY WILL
USE THEIR CHARGE CARDS FOR
GROCERIES AND THINGS IN THE
MEANTIME. TIM:
ARGENTINA IS ABOUT TO GET PAID
$20 BILLION.
IS IT FAIR TO CALL THIS A
BAILOUT? MICHAEL:
IT IS, BUT IT IS NOT EXACTLY
EIGHT BAILOUT.
THEY ARE CALLING IT A SWAP LINE.
AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO
CENTRAL BANKS WHERE ONE THAT
NEEDS DOLLARS SENDS MONEY TO
THE FED AND THE FED SENDS THE
EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF DOLLARS TO
THEM SO COMPANIES IN THAT
COUNTRY CAN PAY THEIR DOLLAR
DENOMINATED BILLS.
THEN THEY SEND IT BACK WITH THE
CRISIS IS OVER AND THE FED
SENDS THEM BACK THEIR MONEY.
THIS IS MORE LIKE A RESCUE
PACKAGE ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT
HAPPENED WITH MEXICO IN 1994
WHERE THE U.S.
USED THE EXCHANGE STABILIZATION
FUND AND AGREED TO GUARANTEE
MEXICAN BONDS THAT COULD NOT BE
SOLD BECAUSE THERE WAS CONCERN
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD
DEFAULT. THE U.S.
GUARANTEED TO THOSE.
THE U.S. BOUGHT SOME ASSETS.
THEY DID NOT GIVE MEXICO CASH
DIRECTLY.
I DON'T THINK WE ARE GIVING
ARGENTINA CASH DIRECTLY.
BUT THIS WILL BE A SYSTEM SET
UP LIKE THAT. TIM:
IS IT A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN
MEXICO BACK THEN?
BECAUSE WE SHARE A BORDER WITH
MEXICO.
THE STABILITY OF MEXICO IS IN
OUR BEST INTEREST BECAUSE IT IS
SUCH A LARGE TRADING PARTNER,
AT LEAST RIGHT NOW.
ARGENTINA IS A DIFFERENT STORY.
IT SEEMS MORE POLITICAL.
MICHAEL:
THERE IS DEFINITELY A POLITICAL
ANGLE TO IT AND IT DEPENDS ON
WHAT YOUR CYNICISM METER GOES
UP TO.
ARGENTINA IS A POSTER CHILD FOR
BAD FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT.
THEY OWE THE IMF BILLIONS AND
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
THEY HAVE DEFAULTED LIKE 23
TIMES.
YOU COULD ARGUE THIS COULD BE
AN ECONOMIC DOMINO LIKE THE WAY
WE SAW THINGS HAPPEN WITH THE
ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS.
THERE IS ALSO THE IDEA THAT A
LOT OF THE HEDGE FUNDS -- HEDGE
FUND LEADERS THAT WORKED WITH
SCOTT BESSENT OVER THE YEARS
HAVE LOADED UP ON ARGENTINE
DEBT, DISTRESSED DEBT BECAUSE
THEY CAN BUY IT AT A DISCOUNT.
AND IF THE ARGENTINE PESO KEEPS
FALLING AS IT HAS AND IS
PREDICTED TO DO IF THEY LOSE
THE ELECTIONS COMING UP, THEN
THESE PEOPLE LOSE A LOT OF
MONEY. IF THE U.S.
CAN PROP UP THE PESO , THIS
HELPS SCOTT BESSENT'S FRIENDS.
NOW I DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT THE
NEW YORK TIMES IS REPORTING ON
THIS.
PAUL KRUGMAN DID A COLUMN ON IT
EARLIER TODAY.
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO GO AS
FAR AS A TINFOIL HAVE --
TINFOIL HAT, BUT MAYBE SARAN
WRAP. TIM:
MAYBE IT IS IN THE SAME DRAWER.
MICHAEL:
IN THESE SITUATIONS YOU GET
PEOPLE WHO ARE NERVOUS ABOUT
THE IMPACT ON AMERICAN
INVESTORS AND FUNDS.
WE SAW THE SAME THING WAS --
WITH GREECE.
GREECE WAS DEFINITELY GOING TO
DEFAULT BUT IT WAS HANDLED VERY
GINGERLY, SO IT DID NOT CAUSE
SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS. TIM:
THE NEXT FED CHAIR MIGHT BE
THINKING ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS
OF THIS.
THAT IS WHERE WE WANT TO END
WITH YOU.
WE LEARNED EARLIER TODAY SOME
OTHER NAMES THAT COULD BE OR
ARE IN THE RUNNING FOR FED
CHAIR FINALISTS.
MICHELLE BOWMAN, CHRIS WALLER,
KEVIN WARSH, KEVIN HASSETT.
WHAT IS THE TIMELINE?
ANYONE ELSE? MICHAEL:
THERE IS A CNBC REPORT THAT
THEY ARE THE FINAL FIVE AND
THEY WOULD DO ANOTHER ROUND OF
INTERVIEWS AND SOME TIME, MAYBE
IN DECEMBER, THE PRESIDENT
WOULD NOMINATE SOMEONE TO THE
STEPHEN MYRON SEAT THAT THE
TERM EXPIRES AT THE END OF
JANUARY AND THAT PERSON WOULD,
ESSENTIALLY, BE DE FACTO FED
CHAIR IN WAITING.
AND IF JAY POWELL RESIGNS THEY
COULD PUT STEVE MYRON BACK IN
THE SEAT, OR SOMEBODY ELSE.
WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER OUTSIDE
CONFIRMATION OF THAT, BUT IT
CERTAINLY TRACKS WITH WHAT THE
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SAYING.
MICHELLE BOWMAN MIGHT BE A
LITTLE BIT D.E.I. HERE.
WE KNOW THEY LIKE HER IN A
REGULATORY ROLE THAT SHE IS IN.
RICK RIEDER HAS A GOOD FOR IT
-- REPUTATION IN THE MARKETS.
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE
PRESIDENT ULTIMATELY IN SUP IN
A FED CHAIR.
HOW MUCH OF A SPLASH DOES HE
WANT TO MAKE IN THE SENSE OF A
ROCK FALLING IN THE POND,
SENDING OUT RIPPLES?
HOW MUCH DOES HE WANT TO UPSET
THE APPLE CART AND HOW MUCH CAN
HE DO WITHOUT UPSETTING THE
MARKETS?
THIS IS SOMETHING TO WATCH OVER
THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS.
ONCE WE GET TO AN ANNOUNCEMENT,
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF REACTION
TO THAT AS WELL.
TIM:
MICHAEL MCKEE JOINING US IN THE
BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK STUDIO.
HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND.
THE S&P 500 IS STILL DOWN TO
THE TUNE OF 1.8%.
THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE DOWN 2.5%.
THE DOW IS DOWN 1.3%.
KIND OF ALL OVER THE PLACE
GEOGRAPHICALLY RIGHT NOW,
BECAUSE INVESTORS HAVE A LOT TO
THINK ABOUT.
OBSERVERS HAVE A LOT TO THINK
ABOUT INCLUDING THE DURABILITY
OF LASTING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE
EAST. ISRAEL BEGAN THE PROCESS
OF WITHDRAWING TROOPS FROM GAZA
WHILE THE U.S.
STARTED THE CLOCK ON A 17 HOUR
WINDOW FOR HAMAS TO RELEASE ALL
THE REMAINING HOSTAGES AS THE
COMPLEX PROCESS OF ENDING THE
TWO YEAR WAR GOT UNDERWAY.
DANA, GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON THE
PROGRAM TODAY.
IS THIS THE BEGINNING OF
LASTING PEACE IN THE REGION?
DANA: DOUBTFUL.
BUT IT COULD BRING RELIEF FOR
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS.
WHAT WE WILL SEE OVER THE NEXT
72 HOURS IS JUST THE INITIAL
PHASE OF THIS PRETTY EXTENSIVE,
VERY BROAD, 20 POINT PLAN.
WE WILL SEE ISRAELI HOSTAGES
HOPEFULLY RELEASED WITHIN THE
NEXT 72 HOURS.
WE WILL SEE PALESTINIAN
PRISONERS RELEASED FROM ISRAELI
JAILS.
WE WILL SEE THE IDF WITHDRAW
FROM PART OF GAZA BUT STILL BE
PRESENT IN MORE THAN 50% OF
GAZA. AND WE WILL SEE A LOT OF
HUMANITARIAN AID FLOW IN.
THIS DOES NOT ADDRESS HAMAS
WEAPONS.
IT DOES NOT ADDRESS WHAT AN
INTERNATIONAL STABILIZATION
FORCE ON THE GROUND IN GAZA
WILL BE OR WHAT THE FUTURE
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WILL BE.
IT IS NOT NECESSARILY PUT US ON
A PATH TO PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD
AND OF COURSE IT DOES NOT
ADDRESS EVERYTHING ELSE KEEPING
US FROM HAVING PEACE IN THE
MIDDLE EAST LIKE IRAN'S NUCLEAR
WEAPONS PROGRAM AND OTHER
TERRORISTS THAT STILL HAVE
BALLISTIC MISSILES AND ARE
FIRING THEM.
EMILY:
A LOT OF OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS.
TALK ABOUT THE CURRENT DEAL.
WHAT MAKES THE CEASE-FIRE AND
HOSTAGE DEAL DIFFERENT FROM
PREVIOUS EFFORTS FOR PEACE WE
HAVE SEEN BETWEEN ISRAEL AND
HAMAS? DANA:
WHAT IS VERY UNIQUE ABOUT THIS
TIME IT'S THE CONVERGENCE OF
STAKEHOLDERS THAT ALL DECIDED
TO PRESSURE ALL SIDES.
FOR THE PAST SEVERAL CEASE-FIRE
NEGOTIATIONS, WITH RESPECT TO
HAMAS AND ISRAEL, THE U.S.
WAS WORKING WITH CUTTER --
QATAR AND EGYPT TO ARE
MEDIATING WITH HAMAS AND THE
U.S. WORKED WITH ISRAEL.
PRESIDENT TRUMP STARTED
BRINGING ARAB AND MUSLIM
LEADERS ALL IN TO BACK HIS PLAN
AND WE SAW HIGH-STAKES
NEGOTIATIONS IN TURKEY AND
EGYPT ALL PUTTING TREMENDOUS
PRESSURE ON HAMAS.
AND FINALLY WE HAVE THE
PERSONAL INVESTMENT AND
COMMITMENT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP,
WHO BACKED ISRAEL.
BUT THEN, AT THE FINAL HOUR,
TOLD HAMAS, I WILL GUARANTEE
THAT ISRAEL WILL NOT RESTART
THIS WAR IF YOU UPHOLD YOUR
COMMITMENTS. EMILY:
NOW THAT THE 72 HOUR WINDOW HAS
BEGUN, WHAT IS THE U.S.
ROLE IN ENFORCING THE
CEASE-FIRE? DANA:
FIRST, IT IS WHETHER OR NOT
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO
STAY PERSONALLY INVESTED IN
THAT LEVEL OF PRESIDENTIAL
INTEREST AND COMMITMENT.
AND SECONDLY, IS THE U.S.
MILITARY ROLE. THE HEAD OF U.S.
MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE
MIDDLE EAST ANNOUNCED THEY WILL
CONTRIBUTE TO THIS JOINT TASK
FORCE TO SUPPORT HOSTAGE
RECOVERY, AND, THE U.S.
MILITARY WILL PROBABLY HAVE A
SIGNIFICANT LEADERSHIP ROLE IN
STANDING UP THIS POSTWAR
STABILIZATION MISSION IN GAZA
AND BRINGING OTHERS IN. TIM:
I AM WONDERING ABOUT THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF CERTAIN PEOPLE
INVOLVED, ESPECIALLY ON THE
AMERICAN SIDE.
STEVE WITKOFF, JARED KUSHNER,
WHO DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME ROLE
HE HAD IN THE WHITE HOUSE
DURING THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST
ADMINISTRATION.
DANA POP JARED KUSHNER HAS NOT
HAD AN OFFICIAL ROLE IN THE
SECOND TRUMP ADMINISTRATION,
BUT IT'S FAIR TO SAY HE HAS
BEEN IN THE BACKGROUND THE
WHOLE TIME AND YOU CAN REALLY
SEE HIS FINGERPRINTS ON THE 20
POINT PLAN.
KUSHNER HAS ALWAYS BEEN A REAL
ADVOCATE OF ECONOMICS, TRADE AS
PART OF A PATH TO PEACE.
THERE ARE A LOT OF ECONOMIC
ANGLES TO THE 20 POINT PLAN.
HE WAS CLEARLY SITTING
ALONGSIDE STEVE WITKOFF IN
EGYPT AND NOW IN ISRAEL TO SEE
THE DETAILS OF THIS
FOLLOW-THROUGH. TIM:
WHAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN GAZA IF
THERE IS LASTING PEACE?
THE POWER VACUUM, WHO ACTUALLY
COMES TO POWER THERE AND WHAT
THEIR VIEWS WILL BE? DANA:
THAT IS REALLY TBD.
HERE IS THE RISK.
WE GET THROUGH THIS INITIAL
PHASE OF THE CEASE-FIRE AND
THERE IS A SECURITY VACUUM AND
THERE IS NOBODY THERE ON THE
GROUND OTHER THAN HAMAS, WHO
STILL HAS THEIR WEAPONS, OR
ISRAEL, WHO IS STILL PRESENT IN
50% OF THE STRIP.
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD LIKE
TO SEE HAPPEN IS THIS
INTERNATIONAL MULTILATERAL
FORCE WITH A LOT OF ARAB AND
MUSLIM COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTING.
IT IS REALLY HARD TO SEE THEM
GOING IN IF HAMAS DOES NOT
AGREE TO GIVE UP THEIR WEAPONS
THAT I THINK THE LEADERS OF
HAMAS UNDERSTAND THAT IF ALL 20
POINTS OF THE PLAN ARE
IMPLEMENTED IT MEANS A
SURRENDER FOR HAMAS.
THEY HAVE TO COMMIT TO PEACEFUL
COEXISTENCE WITH ISRAEL.
IT IS HARD TO SEE A TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION DOING THAT.
IF THEY LEAVE, THEY ARE
SURRENDERING EVERYTHING THEY
WORKED ALL OF THESE DECADES TO
BUILD UP.
THE LIKELIHOOD IS ACTUALLY MORE
VIOLENT SHORT TERM.
THE HOPE IS I HAVE -- IF THE
PEACE PLAN IS IMPLEMENTED WE
HAVE A CHANCE THAT PALESTINIAN
SELF-DETERMINATION IN GAZA AND
ALSO THE WEST BANK.
EMILY:
YOU NOTED HAMAS ACCEPTED THE
DEAL UNDER MILITARY AND
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE.
I AM WONDERING WHAT KIND OF
LESSONS WE LEARN FROM THAT.
DOES THAT MEAN MORE PRESSURE
NEEDS TO BE APPLIED TO REACH
THE NEXT STAGE OF A DEAL THAT
COULD LEAD TO LASTING PEACE?
DANA:
WELL, THE ISRAELI OPERATIONS IN
GAZA HAVE RECEIVED SO MUCH
INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL
CONDEMNATION AND CRITICISM, BUT
I THINK WE HAVE TO BE HONEST
HERE.
WE WOULD NOT BE WHERE WE ARE
TODAY WITHOUT AT LEAST SOME OF
THE ISRAELI ACTIONS IN GAZA
THAT TOOK OUT ALL THE HAMAS TOP
LEADERSHIP, DISMANTLED A LOT OF
THE TUNNELS, AND ARE CONTINUING
DESPITE INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM.
IT IS CLEAR IT IS NOT MILITARY
PRESSURE ALONE.
IT IS POLITICAL PRESSURE FROM
THE LONGTIME BACKERS OF HAMAS.
NEARLY EXACTLY TWO YEARS AFTER
OCTOBER 7, WHAT IS CLEAR IS
EGYPT DID NOT WANT A FLOOD OF
PALESTINIANS FROM GAZA COMING
INTO THE SINAI.
QATAR WANTED IT TO BE OVER,
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE ISRAELI
STRIKE IN DOHA THAT TARGETED
HAMAS LEADERSHIP.
AND TURKEY, WHO HAS LONGTIME
CONNECTIONS TO HAMAS, PRESIDENT
ALREADY WANTS -- PRESIDENT
ERDOGAN'S TOP SECURITY AIDE WAS
ON THE GROUND IN ASIA -- EACH
OF NEGOTIATING THIS.
TIM:
DANA STROULL JOINING US FROM
WASHINGTON, D.C..
COMING UP IN A MINUTE, WE SPEAK
WITH THE CFO OF THE PUBLICLY
TRADED COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY
LUMEN TECHNOLOGIES. HERE IS.
CHARLIE:
VERY CLOSE TO SESSION LOWS
RIGHT NOW ON THE S&P 500 INDEX,
ON TRACK FOR A LOSING WEEK.
A LOSS OF 1.5% ON THE WEEK.
THE DOW, THE S&P, THE NASDAQ
ALL IN THE RED.
MONTHS LONG, ON WALL STREET
CAME TO AN END TODAY WHEN
STOCKS RAISED EARLY GAINS AFTER
PRESIDENT TRUMP THREATENED A
MASSIVE INCREASE OF TARIFFS ON
CHINESE PRODUCTS IMPORTED INTO
THE U.S..
STOCKS STARTED SELLING OFF
AROUND 10:55 A.M.
WALL STREET TIME.
THE S&P IS LOWER BY 1.7%, CLOSE
TO SESSION LOWS, DOWN 112.
THE DOW IS DOWN 515, A DROP OF
1.1 PERCENT.
THE NASDAQ IS DOWN 2.3%.
THE MAGNIFICENT 7 IS DOWN 2.5%
FOR THE 10 YEAR 4.0 4%, THE
TWO-YEAR YIELDING 3.51%.
GOLD, FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN,
ADVANCING $30 TO THE OUNCE OF

SILVER ABOVE 5050, UP BY 2%.
JOHNSON & JOHNSON IN TALKS TO

THERAPEUTICS. J&J DOWN .5%.
IT REPORTS EARNINGS NEXT WEEK.
PROTAGONIST UP BY 33%.
I AM CHARLIE PELLETT AND THAT
IS A BLOOMBERG'S BUSINESS FLASH.
TIM:
IT IS TIME FOR ANOTHER EDITION
OF THE CFO BRIEF IN JOINED BY
CHRIS STANSBERRY, CHIEF
FINANCIAL OFFICER AND EVP OF
THE LOUISIANA-BASED PUBLICLY
TRADED GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS
TECHNOLOGY LUMEN TECHNOLOGY
WITH SHARES OF THIS YEAR 25%.
IT US IN THE STUDIO IS NINA
TRENTMANN, BLOOMBERG NEWS
SENIOR EDITOR.
SHE WRITES A NEWSLETTER YOU CAN
SUBSCRIBE TO AT BLOOMBERG.COM.
CHRIS IS FEATURED IN THE MOST
RECENT ADDITION OF THE
NEWSLETTER AND JOINS US FROM
DENVER. CHRIS, WELCOME.
THE COMPANY DIVESTING NON-CORE
ASSETS, EARLIER THIS YEAR,
ANNOUNCING THE SALE OF ITS
MASS-MARKET RESIDENTIAL FIBER
UNIT AT&T FOR $5.75 BILLION IN
CASH. YOU ARE PLANNING TO LEASE
EXISTING FIBER ROUTES TO
HYPERSCALERS AND SOCIAL MEDIA
COMPANIES TO TRANSPORT A OUR
TRAFFIC BETWEEN DATA CENTERS.
HOW BIG OF AN OPPORTUNITY IS IT
TO LEAST HYPERSCALERS?
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME
TODAY.
IT HAS BEEN A JOURNEY AT LUMEN
OVER THE LAST THREE AND A HALF
YEARS.
WE HAVE SEEN AN OPPORTUNITY
THROUGHOUT TRANSFORMATION.
THE ARA MULTI-CLOUD WORLD IS
BEING DEVELOPED RIGHT NOW.
THE NETWORK OF YESTERDAY IT WAS
NOT BUILT TO SUPPORT THIS.
IF YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT THE
ECONOMICS OF AI AND THE
ECONOMICS OF A GPU, YOU WANT TO
KEEP THE GPU FED AS MUCH AS IT
CAN CONSUME.
THAT IS WHERE YOU GET THE
ECONOMIC BENEFIT.
THE PROBLEM WITH A NETWORK THAT
HAS EXISTED SO FAR IS THAT HAS
THE DATA -- IS THAT AS THE DATA
LOADS ARE SPREAD FURTHER AND
FURTHER AWAY, AS DATA CENTERS
ARE IN SEARCH OF POWER AND
COOLER TEMPERATURES THERE ARE
LATENCY PROBLEMS AND ACCESS
PROBLEMS.
WE’RE BUILDING A MESH THAT
GOES EVERYWHERE AND ANYWHERE
WHERE THE CUSTOMER ON DEMAND
CAN MOVE THE WORKLOADS IN SUPER
LOW LATENCY MANNER.
SO THAT’S THE BIG CHANGE.
AND SO IT’S NOT JUST
HYPERSCALERS, IT’S REALLY THE
FULL CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE
HYPERSCALERS RUNNING THOSE
CLOUDS, THE HYPERSCALERS
OBVIOUSLY BUILDING THOSE A.I.
ALGORITHMS AND LARGE ENTERPRISE
CUSTOMERS WHO ARE ON THE A.I.
JOURNEY NOW AND WILL BE USING
IT MUCH MORE HEAVILY IN THE
FUTURE. NINA:
YOU’VE REALLY IMPROVED YOUR
FINANCING STRUCTURE.
YOU’RE SAYING HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS IN INTEREST EXPENSES A
YEAR.
TALK TO US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
THAT. CHRIS:
THE BALANCE SHEET WAS NOT OUR
FRIEND. WE HAD A LOT OF DEBT.
HALF THAT DEBT WAS DUE IN ONE
YEAR, IN 2027.
AND THAT WAS JOB NUMBER ONE.
WE REALLY NEEDED TO STRENGTH
THEN FOUNDATION OF THE COMPANY
SO WE COULD GO TO THE THE
THINGS THAT WE’RE EXECUTING
TODAY.
SO THOSE WELL ACCOMPLISHED
THROUGH A COUPLE OF THINGS.
ONE IS WE DID THE LARGEST DEBT
RESTRUCTURING IN HISTORY.
THAT’S NOT QUITE TWO YEARS AGO.
BUT AT A SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE.
BUT FROM THERE, WE SAW IN THE
MIDDLE OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS,
WE SAW THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH
THE HYPERSCALERS AND SOON AFTER
THAT, THAT DEBT NEGOTIATION WAS
COMPLETED, WE SIGNED $8 BILLION
WORTH OF DEALS AND THAT HAS
GROWN SINCE.
THAT ALLOWED US TO MONETIZE AN
ASSET THAT HAS BEEN ON THE
GROUND FOR 25 YEARS, WHICH IS
CON WITHOUT -- CONDUIT THAT WE
CAN BLOW FIBER THROUGH TO MEET
THE NEEDS OF THE HYPERSCALERS
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
VERSUS BUILDING NEW.
BUT THE CASH FROM THOSE DEALS
ALLOW US TO FINANCE IN DELEVER.
AND WITH THE SALE OF THE
CONSUMER FIBER BUSINESS TO
AT&T, WHEN THAT CLOSES, OUR
DEBT WILL BE DOWN TO JUST OVER
3 BILLION AND OUR INTEREST
EXPENSE ON ANNUALIZED BASIS
WILL BE $700 MILLION.
SO IN A TWO-YEAR PERIOD,
DRAMATICALLY RESHAPING BOTH THE
QUALM OF DEBT SWELLS -- QUANTUM
OF DEBT AND THE MATURITY CURVE
AS WE INVEST IN THE A.I.
MULTI-CLOUD WORLD. NINA:
THERE’S A LOT OF CAPXERS
REQUIRED LIKE YOURS.
WE’VE SEEN EARLIER THIS YEAR
THE ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL
THAT WAS PASSED WHICH TRIES TO
ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT, INCLUDING
IN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS BY
ALLOWING USCFO.
DO YOU THINK THIS WILL MAKE AN
IMPACT AS YOU THINK ABOUT
FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN YOUR
BUSINESS HERE IN THE U.S.?
CHRIS: DEFINITELY.
IF YOU BACK TO THE 2017
LEGISLATION, IT CREATED AN
UNEQUAL PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN
SAY MORE SERVICE ORIENTED ORS A
SET-LIGHT COMPANIES AND ASSET
HEAVIER INFRASTRUCTURE
COMPANIES. IT’S CLEARLY AROUND
INFRASTRUCTURE.
THAT’S WHERE THE U.S.
HAS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES,
REALLY, IS MAKING SURE THAT WE
GOT TO GET TOO FAR BEHIND IN
FOUR INFRASTRUCTURE.
THAT WAS AROUND TWO THINGS.
THE FIRST IS THAT THERE WAS
INTEREST DEDUCTIBILITY LIMITS
THAT USED TO EXIST THAT HAVE
BEEN RELAXED DRAMATICALLY.
BECAUSE AGAIN, ASSET HEAVY
COMPANIES HAVE HIGHER LEVERAGE.
AND TO YOUR POINT, THE ABILITY
TO ACCELERATE DEPRECIATION, TO
HELP ON THE TAX SIDE IS
SIGNIFICANT.
THAT REDUCES THE RISK THAT
COMPANIES THAT ARE INVESTING IN
INFRASTRUCTURE TAKE ON WHEN
THEY MAKE THOSE KINDS OF
INVESTMENTS.
SO IT’S ABSOLUTELY AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR US. TIM:
CHRIS, YOU GOT TO COME BACK AND
JOIN US ONCE AGAIN.

NEWS WHENEVER YOU GET YOUR
PODCAST I’M CHARLIE PELLET.
THAT WAS A BLOOMBERG BUSINESS
FLASH. TIM:
THANK YOU, CHARLIE THE
GREENBACK IS STILL TRADING ON
THE CUSP OF ITS BEST WEEK OF
THE YEAR THE PRESIDENT’S LATEST
TARIFFS SALVO PROMMING THE
DOLLAR RALLY.
J.T. IS HERE WITH US.
WE’VE SEEN THE DOLLAR RECOVER A
BIT THIS MONTH. UNTIL TODAY.
IS THIS A TEMPORARY SETBACK OR
IS THIS SOMETHING BIGGER? J.T.:
I WOULD SAY THAT INTERESTINGLY,
WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING THE LAST
FEW SESSIONS AT LEAST IS THAT
THEY WERE LIVING IN A U.S.
NIRVANA WHERE WE DON’T KNOW
WHERE WE’RE FINDING.
THE HYPERFOCUS THAT MARKETS HAD
ON FED CUTS.
HOW MUCH IS THE FED GOING TO
CUT OR EASE NEXT YEAR WE TOOK A
BREAK FROM THAT THANKS TO
GETTING U.S. DATA.
IT’S WHERE YOU HAVE ELECTIONS
IN JAPAN.
YOU HAD FRENCH ELECTION AND
DRAG ON.
ALL OF THIS ALLOWED THE DOLLAR
TO BEHAVE LIKE A SAFE HAVEN
AGAIN.
SO THAT SORT OF -- GAVE THE
DOLLAR THE STRENGTH FOR THE
LAST FIVE YEARS AND GAVE DOLLAR
THAT NICE VARIETY.
YOU BRING UP A VERY GOOD
QUESTION.
DOES THAT CHANGE OR IS IT JUST
A BOUNCE?
THAT’S A QUESTION THAT CLIENTS
HAVE BEEN ASKING US AS WELL BUT
BIG PICTURE, IT’S UNLIKELY THAT
EURO IS GOING TO COLLAPSE.
THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION POLICY
UNCERTAINTY IS STILL GOING TO
LIVE.
STILL GOING TO BE THERE FOR THE
MAJORITY OF THE NEXT THREE
YEARS AND IF ANYTHING, TODAY IS
THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT
WHERE YOU HAVE HEADLINES COME
OUT WITH CHINA.
AND THAT’S TAKING A HIT ON THE
DOLLAR AGAIN. EMILY:
THE DOLLAR BEING SEEN AS A SAFE
HAVEN ASSET.
WE’RE SEEING TREASURIES, REALLY
RALLYING TODAY.
PEOPLE PILING IN THERE.
HOW DO YOU COMPARE WHICH ONE, I
GUESS, SIGNALS A WEAKENING
OUTLOOK FOR THE MACRO PICTURE?
TRADERS ARE PILING.
TREASURIES VERSUS THE DOLLAR.
ARE THERE ANY SIGNALS WE CAN
GLEAN FROM THOSE MOVES? J.T.:
THAT’S A GOOD DEBATE THAT PEEVE
HAVE HAD.
SURELY, DOLLAR HAS HAD A VERY
BAD YEAR.
IN FACT, THE MAJOR HOLDERS OUT
THERE, THEY HAVE BEEN CLEARLY
BUYING GOLD.
IT’S NOT AS IF THEY HAVE
DESERTED TREASURIES.
BUT THE DOLLAR’S RELATIONSHIP
WITH TREASURIES HAS BROKEN
BECAUSE WHILE EVERYONE WANTS TO
HOLE U.S.
ASSET, THEY DON’T WANT TO HOLD
IT UNRIDGED.
THEY’RE DIVERSIFYING AWAY FROM
THE DOLLAR.
BUT CLEARLY THERE’S A SHIFT
AWAY FROM THE DOLLAR WHICH HAS
MADE THAT RELATIONSHIP WEAKER.
EMILY: WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE
DEBASEMENT TRADE THEN.
YOU MENTIONED GOLD WHEN YOU
CAME IN BEFORE THE SHOW STARTED.
IT’S AT A RECORD-HIGH.
BITCOIN HAS BEEN RALLYING. TIM:
SO YOU WENT TO BITCOIN. EMILY:
ALL OF THESE OTHER ASSETS.
IS THAT A RESULT OF PEOPLE
MOVING AWAY FROM THE DOLLAR?
THE DOLLAR LOSING ITS APPEAL?
J.T.: DEFINITELY YES.
SO PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS TALKED
ABOUT DOLLAR AS A SHARE OF
RESERVES COLLAPSING BUT THAT’S
BEEN TRUE FOR THE LAST DECADE.
BUT I THINK AS WE ENTER THIS
YEAR, THE MARGINAL COLLAPSE AND
PEOPLE HOLDING THE DOLLAR HAS
AMPLIFIED BECAUSE IF ALL THE
UNCERTAINTY WE’RE DEALING WITH
NOW.
IT WAS ALSO OUTSIDE THE U.S.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN MANY,
MANY YEARS WHERE U.S.
HAS BECOME THE SOURCE AND
EMULATING SOURCE OF GLOBAL
UNCERTAINTY IN THE WORLD WHICH
IS WHY EVERYONE IS SHIRE
HOLDING DOLLARS IN THEIR
PORTFOLIOS WHICH IS WHY A LOT
OF THE INVESTORS AND CLIENTS WE
SPEAK TO HAVE NOW THINKING OF
DIVERSIFYING AWAY FROM U.S.
ASSETS, NOT MARGINALLY, MUCH
LESS SO BECAUSE I’M SURE WE CAN
ALL DEBATE FOR MONTHS ON END.
BUT CLEARLY, THERE’S
ALTERNATIVES TO THE U.S.
DOLLAR WHERE PEOPLE FROM SHOWN
A GREATER PREFERENCE FOR THE
EURO AND IN FACT, AT TIMES,
EURO HAS BEEN BEHAVING LIKE A
SAFE HAVEN AND THE DOLLAR MUCH
LESS. TIM:
WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE
HEARD FROM KEN GRIFFIN EARLIER
THIS WEEK.
WAS THAT THIS WEEK OR LAST WEEK?
I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHAT DAY IT
IS. EMILY: THAT WAS THIS WEEK.
TIM: OK, THANK YOU. EMILY:
AND RAY AS WELL. TIM: YEAH.
RAY DALIO SAID THAT GOLD WAS
MORE OF A SAFE HAVEN THAN YOU
HAD ALSO KEN GRIFFIN
ESSENTIALLY SAY IF HE ASKED IF
HE AGREED WITH THE VIEW THAT IT
REFLECTS ANXIETY, HOW IS GOLD A
DIVERSIFIER NOW VERSUS THAN A
FEW YEARS AGOING?
SHOULD PEOPLE BE THINKING ABOUT
THE POSITION IN OUR PORTFOLIO
IS DIFFERENTLY NOW? J.T.:
I THINK GOLD HAS CLEARLY BEEN
VERY TOP OF POINT OF LATE.
AND THAT DEFINITELY PLAYS INTO
BOTH THAT CENTRAL BANKS AROUND
THE WORLD HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
HOLD GOLD ASSETS.
SO CENTRAL BANKS AND YELLOW
METAL HAVE URGED IN THE --
SURGED IN THE LAST YEAR.
THAT’S BEEN ONGOING FOR THE
LAST FIVE YEARS BUT IT HAS TAKE
AN BIG AMPLIFY COMPARISON UP
THIS YEAR.
SO THAT IS WHAT LED TO THE
VALUE OF GOLD AND A LEFT OF THE
OTHER INVESTORS MOSTLY BE ON
THE SIDELINES LIKE GOLD.
NOW, WITH THE UNCERTAINTY
AROUND THE WORLD PEOPLE TALKING
ABOUT HOLDING THEIR DEBT IN
BITCOIN AS WELL, WITH ALL OF
THAT AND WITH CREATOR
UNCERTAINTY IN THE U.S., ACTING
AS THE GLOBAL CURRENCY OF THE
WORLD, LAST BIGGER SHIFT OFF
INVESTOR PREFERENCE BOTH AS AN
INVESTMENT ASSET AND AS A
SAFETY ASSET.
WHATEVER HAPPENS ISST IT’S A
PHYSICAL METAL, WHICH IS NOT
LINKED TO ANY PARTICULAR
GOVERNMENT AND THEIR POLICY.
WHEREAS A DOLLAR IS LINKED TO
THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION AND ITS
POLICIES. EMILY:
I WANT TO END ON JUST THE
HEADLINES THAT WE’RE SEEING
TODAY, THIS IDEA THAT PERHAPS
TRADE TENSIONS ARE ESCALATING
EVEN FURTHER NOW BETWEEN THE
U.S. AND CHINA.
HOW DOES THAT SPECIFICALLY
IMPACT YOUR VIEWS ON G10FX
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS HERE?
J.T.:
I WOULD SAY DEPENDING UPON WHAT
KIND OF A PICTURE THIS EVOLVES
INTO THE OUTCOMES FROM HERE
GETS WORSE, LET’S SAY IF TRUMP
COMES OUT AND AGAIN, ANNOUNCES
A TARIFF INCREASE ON CHINA,
CLOSE TO 150% OR ABOVE THAT,
WHICH IS WHAT WE SAW AT THE
START OF THE YEAR, THAT’S
AGAIN, GOING TO BRING BACK A
LOT OF -- INTO MARKETS.
IN FACT, IT’S BEEN HEADING
LOWER. A LOT OF FX TRADERS WERE
FRUSTRATED WITH THE MOVE WE SAW
IN Q3. THAT’S GOING TO CHANGE.
YOU WILL BRING BACK A LOT MORE
VOLATILITY INTO THE MARKET.
THEY WILL BE CONCERNS ON BOTH
SIDES.
BOTH COUNTRIES LINKED TO CHINA
AND CHINESE EXPORTS SO EURO CAN
TAKE A HIT.
CHILE -- AND THE U.S.
DOLLAR WILL TAKE A HIT.
IT WILL BE A LOT MORE
VOLATILITY AND WILL HURT
CURRENCIES IN THAT WAY. TIM:
IN THE MEANTIME, WE’RE SEEING
STOCKS HIT A NEW LOW AS WE GET
INTO, WE’RE CLOSE THE LAST HOUR
OF TRADING.
THE S&P 500 DOWN BY 2%.
WHEN WE COME BACK, SOME STOCKS
THAT ARE ON THE MOVE.
THIS IS "BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK
DAILY." ♪
EMILY:
THIS IS "BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK
DAILY."
I’M EMILY GRAFFEO HERE WITH TIM
STENOVEC.
CAROL MASSAR IS OUT TODAY.
THE S&P DOWN 2%.
THE NASDAQ 100 DOWN ALMOST 3%
RIGHT NOW.
AND INVESTORS PILING IN TO
TREASURY YIELDS WITH YIELDS
FALLING ACROSS THE CURVE.
WHERE ARE THEY GOING, TIM?
I GUESS THEY’RE BUYING A LITTLE
BIT OF GOLD RIGHT NOW AS A SAFE
HAVEN. TIM: I GUESS.
THE ONLY THING BEING BOUGHT IN
THERE ARE CONSUMER STAPLES.
EVERY OTHER GROUP IS IN THE RED.
THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DOWN
TO THE TUNE OF MORE THAN 3%.
CONSUMER DISCRETION DOWN. EMILY:
LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME
STOCKS ON THE MOVE TODAY.
I’M EMILY GRAFFEO WITH TIM
STENOVEC.
AND WE’RE JOINED BY BLOOMBERG
CROSS ASSET REPORTER.
DID YOU PICK A GAINER OR A
DECLINER FOR US FIRST?
>> I PICKED A GAINER FOR A
CHANGE. BECAUSE YOU SAID ALL THE
EXPERTS ARE IN THE RED BUT RARE
EARTH MATERIALS, WE’RE SEEING
SOPPING OF THE BIG GAINERS.
WHICH IS NOT A SURPRISE.
MP STOCK IS UP 30%.
IT’S COMING OFF ALL THE
HEADLINES FOR GETTING FROM THE
ADMINISTRATION.
PRESIDENT TRUMP THREAT TO
INCREASE TARIFF OVER THE RARE
EARTH CONTROL HAS SENT
INVESTORS RUSHING INTO THE FEW
COMPANIES THAT HAVE EXPOSURE.
MP’S IS UP MORE THAN 400%
YEAR-TO-DATE.
SOME OF THE BIGGEST WINNERS.
RARE EARTH PRODUCER, THE U.S.
HAS ALREADY TAKEN A STAKE IN
WHICH WE ALREADY SAW A LOT OF
EUPHORIA FOR THE STOCK AFTER
THAT. TRUMP SAID THAT THE CHINA
EXPORT CONTROLS ON RARE EARTH
IS A RATHER SINISTER AND
HOSTILE MOVE.
AND THEY AGREED A 400 MILLION
EQUITY INVESTMENT TEAM THROUGH
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE
THE COMPANY’S LARGEST
SHAREHOLDER.
THAT WILL HELP FUND THE PLANT
FOR RARE EARTH FLAG NATS.
SO THAT’S A PLACE EVERYONE’S
BEEN WATCHINGTH IT’S BEEN ON A
RALLY AND EVEN MORE TODAY AS
EVERYTHING IS GOING DOWN. EMILY:
424%. A YEAR-TO-DATE GAIN IN MP.
TIM: YEAH.
IT’S PRETTY AMAZING. U.S.A.
RARE EARTHS UP 200% SO FAR THIS
YEAR.
A LOT OF THAT HAPPENING JUST
GOING BACK TO SEPTEMBER. EMILY:
YOU WRITE ABOUT ETF’S.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST RARE EARTH
ETF’S AND STRATEGIC METALS ETF
IS ONLY UP 80% AND THEN THERE’S
THE INDIVIDUAL HOLDINGS THAT
ARE UP TOO MUCH BIGGER.
ANYWAY, WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE
FOR US?
>> THE WINNERS ARE CONCENTRATED
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TECH.
WE’RE SEEING SOME WINNERS
APPLIED DIGITAL SHARES WERE UP
WITH AS MUCH AS 33%.
NOW STILL ABOUT 16% WHICH WHAT
WE’RE SEEING WITH TECH STOCKS
THAT’S CLEARLY A BIG GAIN HERE.
SHARES OF DIGITAL CLIMB AFTER
THE DATA CENTER AVAILABLE
SECURED MORE FUNDING FOR ITS
PROJECTS FOR BULLISH
HYPERSCALERS AND ALSO POSTED
BETTER THAN EXPECTED RESULTS
FOR THE FIRST QUARTER.
SO WHAT WE SAW FOR THE QUARTER
THAT ENDED AUGUST 31 APPLIED
DIGITAL REPORTED A LOSS OF 3
CENTS A SHARE WHICH IS NARROWER
THAN 60 CENTS.
SO CLEARLY, BIG RELIEF THERE.
AND IF WE ZOOM OUT ON THIS ONE,
THE STOCK IS UP 370%
YEAR-TO-DATE.
THAT’S ANOTHER MASSIVE GAIN.
A SMALL COMPANY SO.
THIS MOVE MAKES SENSE.
BUT THE A.I.
BOOM HAS BEEN INTENSIFYING THIS
RACE, ESPECIALLY FOR A.I.
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THIS IS ONE
OF THE CLEAR WINNERS EVEN ON A
PRETTY BAD DAY FOR AMERICANS.
TIM: I’M PRETTY IMPRESSED OF THE
FOUR STOCKS YOU CHOSE, AT LEAST
TWO OF THEM HAVE BEEN GAINERS
ON A DAY WHEN WE’RE SEEING
WIDESPREAD SELLING.
LET’S GO TO SOME ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE TRADE.
>> WE’RE DONE WITH THE GOOD
NEWS.
LEVI STRAUSS IS HAVING A PRETTY
DAD DAY AND THIS WAS BEFORE THE
ANNOUNCEMENT AND IT’S CONNECTED
WITH TARIFFS. IT FELL 14%.
NOW IT’S ABOUT 12%.
THE APPAREL MAKER UPGRADED
EARNS GUIDANCE BUT STILL FELL
SHORT OF HIGHER INVESTOR
EXPECTATION AND THEY BLAME IT
ON THE TARIFFS.
THEY RAISED ITS OUTLOOK BUT
WARN THAT TARIFFS ARE STARTING
TO BITE.
AND THE PROBLEM IS IT’S REALLY
HARD TO CALCULATE.
THEY EXPECT 30% TARIFFS IN
CHINA.
BUT INCREASED IN EXPECTATIONS
TO 20% FOR THE REST OF THE
WORLD. AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE
ANNOUNCEMENT CLEARLY THIS IS A
VERY VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT FOR
RETAILERS.
AND ACTUALLY LEVI STRAUSS WAS
ONE OF THE WINNERS.
IT’S STILL UP 25% YEAR-TO-DATE
BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW ONE
HEADLINE YOU RAISE IS ALMOST
HALF HALF OF THE GAINS THIS
YEAR.
BEYOND YOGA, ONE OF THEIR BRAND
HAS BEEN PERFORMING QUITE WELL.
REVENUE WAS 1.5 BILLION.
BUT STILL THIS IS IN THE ENOUGH
WHEN TARIFFS ARE BITING. TIM:
OK. WE HAVE 20 SECONDS TO TALK
ABOUT SOME FERTILIZER.
>> ANOTHER STOCK THAT IS
SUFFERING IS MOSAIC.
SHARES ARE DOWN 7%.
THE MO FERTILIZER FELL BELOW
WHAT MANAGEMENT EXPECTED.
WE ALSO HAVE TRADE WAR
IMPLICATIONS HERE.
SO THAT’S NOT BEEN SUFFERING
BUT IT’S STILL UP TO DATE. TIM:
