From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.

 Here's
 what
 we're


covering


[Music]


this
 morning.
 Around
 3:00
 a.m.
 Eastern,


widespread
 outages
 started
 for
 hundreds


of
 websites
 and
 apps.
 The
 issue,
 a


disruption
 of
 Amazon
 Web
 Services,
 which


a
 lot
 of
 companies
 rely
 on
 for
 data


storage
 and
 running
 the
 back
 end
 of


things.
 In
 an
 update
 around
 5:30
 a.m.,


Amazon
 said
 its
 cloud
 services
 were


mostly
 up
 and
 running
 again,
 but
 the


list
 of
 affected
 companies
 includes


everything
 from
 McDonald's
 to
 Netflix
 to


the
 messaging
 app
 Signal
 to


cryptocurrency
 platforms.
 The
 outages


underscore
 just
 how
 much
 of
 the
 internet


runs
 off
 of
 Amazon
 services.

In
 Gaza
 yesterday,


>> a
 new
 round
 of
 Israeli
 strikes
 killed
 at


least
 40
 people,
 according
 to
 health


officials
 there,
 and
 many
 others
 were


rushed
 to
 the
 hospital
 as
 the
 fragile


week
 old
 ceasefire
 between
 Israel
 and


Hamas
 was
 put
 to
 the
 test.
 The
 Israeli


military
 said
 it
 carried
 out
 the
 strikes


after
 Palestinian
 fighters
 fired
 on
 its


troops,
 killing
 two
 soldiers
 near
 Rafa.


Hamas's
 military
 wing
 said
 it
 wasn't


aware
 of
 that
 clash
 and
 that
 it
 lost


contact
 with
 its
 fighters
 in
 that
 area


months
 ago.
 In
 another
 flare
 up
 of


violence,
 Israeli
 forces
 opened
 fire
 on


a
 car
 on
 Friday
 that
 they
 say
 crossed


into
 an
 area
 controlled
 by
 the
 military.


That
 attack
 killed
 at
 least
 nine
 people,


including
 four
 children.
 A
 relative
 of


the
 victims
 told
 the
 Times
 that
 they


were
 all
 members
 of
 the
 same
 family
 and


that
 he
 thinks
 they
 got
 lost
 and
 crossed


into
 the
 Israeli
 zone
 by
 mistake.
 The


Israeli
 military
 often
 publishes


warnings
 about
 where
 civilians
 shouldn't


go.
 But
 over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 war,
 many


Gazins
 who
 either
 don't
 have
 cell


service
 or
 became
 disoriented
 in
 the


devastated
 landscape
 have
 been
 unsure


whether
 or
 not
 they're
 in
 those


restricted
 areas.


Last
 night,
 despite
 both
 sides
 accusing


the
 other
 of
 violating
 the
 truce,
 Israel


and
 Hamas
 said
 that
 they
 are
 still


committed
 to
 maintaining
 the
 peace
 deal.


Now,
 three
 updates
 on
 the
 Trump


administration.


On
 Saturday,
 in
 thousands
 of
 locations


across
 the
 US,
 demonstrators
 took
 to
 the


streets
 to
 protest
 the
 administration.


Events
 were
 scheduled
 in
 all
 50
 states.


In
 New
 York
 City,
 officials
 said
 more


than
 a
 100,000
 people
 turned
 out
 and
 the


crowds
 at
 one
 rally
 in
 Chicago
 stretched


for
 22
 blocks.


>> At
 the
 protests,
 dubbed
 No
 King's
 Day


demonstrations,
 people
 said
 they
 felt


like
 Trump
 had
 crossed
 the
 line
 from


behaving
 like
 a
 president
 to
 acting
 like


a
 monarch.
 Some
 of
 those
 who
 marched
 and


held
 signs
 told
 the
 Times
 they
 were


outraged
 by
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 issues.
 the


deployment
 of
 federal
 troops
 in
 American


cities,
 government
 layoffs,
 and


immigration
 raids.


>> You
 know,
 the
 domestic
 community,
 they


are
 a
 community.
 So,
 we're
 pretty
 much


here
 to
 fight
 for
 those
 that
 are
 scared


to
 come
 out
 their
 house,
 scared
 to
 go
 to


school,
 their
 kids
 aren't.


>> In
 response
 to
 the
 protests,
 Republican


leaders
 denounced
 them
 as
 a
 quote
 hate


America
 rally.
 When
 asked
 if
 the


president
 had
 a
 comment
 on
 the


demonstrations,
 a
 White
 House


spokeswoman
 replied
 by
 email,
 quote,
 who


cares?


>> I
 think
 it's
 a
 joke.
 I
 looked
 at
 the


people.
 They're
 not
 representative
 of


this
 country.


>> President
 Trump
 himself
 later
 claimed


without
 evidence.
 The
 events
 were
 funded


by
 what
 he
 called
 radical
 left
 lunatics.


And
 the
 White
 House
 posted
 an
 AI


generated
 image
 of
 Trump
 and
 Vice


President
 J.
 Dance
 wearing
 crowns.


Also,


>> thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for


having
 me.
 And
 um
 thank
 you
 to
 President


Trump
 for
 having
 such
 an
 amazing
 will


for
 second
 chances.
 Um,
 you
 know,


>> George
 Santos,
 the
 disgraced
 Republican


congressman
 from
 New
 York,
 went
 on
 Fox


News
 yesterday
 to
 thank
 President
 Trump


for
 commuting
 his
 sentence.
 Santos
 was


released
 from
 prison
 Friday
 night
 after


serving
 less
 than
 3
 months
 of
 his
 more


than
 7-year
 sentence.
 He
 pleaded
 guilty


this
 spring
 to
 wire
 fraud
 and
 identity


theft
 and
 admitted
 to
 lying
 to
 Congress


and
 stealing
 from
 campaign
 donors.
 A


congressional
 ethics
 investigation
 found


he'd
 spent
 campaign
 funds
 on
 cosmetic


procedures,
 designer
 clothes,
 and
 only


fans
 purchases.
 In
 a
 post
 online,
 Trump


said
 he
 felt
 Santos's
 sentence
 was


excessive.
 It's
 part
 of
 a
 farreaching


wave
 of
 clemency
 that
 the
 president
 has


granted
 to
 political
 allies
 this
 term.


>> Now,
 you
 said
 you
 could
 get
 Botox
 now


that
 you're
 out.


>> I
 can.
 Okay.


>> Something
 you
 can't
 do
 in
 prison.
 You


can.
 Thank
 you.

And
 last
 one,
 the
 president
 of
 Colombia


has
 accused
 the
 US
 of
 murdering
 an


innocent
 fisherman
 in
 an
 attack
 on
 a


boat
 the
 US
 claimed
 was
 carrying
 illicit


drugs.
 In
 the
 past
 2
 months,
 the
 US


military
 has
 blown
 up
 multiple
 boats
 in


the
 Caribbean
 Sea,
 saying
 it's
 necessary


to
 stop
 dangerous
 drugs
 from
 entering


the
 US.
 Many
 military
 law
 specialists,


however,
 have
 called
 the
 attacks
 illegal


because
 soldiers
 cannot
 lawfully
 target


civilians
 who
 don't
 pose
 a
 threat
 in
 the


moment.
 There
 have
 also
 been
 questions


about
 who
 has
 been
 on
 the
 boats.
 The


administration
 has
 not
 provided
 any


evidence
 to
 support
 its
 claims
 that
 they


were
 smugglers
 beyond
 descriptions
 of


intelligence
 assessments.
 The
 Colombian


president
 said
 one
 of
 the
 men
 killed
 in


midepptember
 was
 a
 lifelong
 fisherman


and
 urged
 his
 attorney
 general
 to
 help


the
 man's
 family
 file
 claims
 against
 the


US
 for
 his
 death.
 He
 suggested
 they
 join


up
 with
 a
 Trinidadian
 family
 that
 also


says
 one
 of
 their
 relatives,
 another


fisherman,
 was
 killed
 in
 a
 different


boat
 strike.
 Trump
 responded
 to
 the


accusation
 by
 saying
 he
 would
 cut
 aid
 to


Colombia
 and
 impose
 new
 tariffs
 on
 goods


from
 the
 country.
 After
 that,
 Defense


Secretary
 Pete
 Hegsth
 revealed
 the
 US


had
 struck
 another
 boat
 allegedly


carrying
 drugs,
 this
 one
 on
 Friday.
 He


said
 it
 was
 connected
 to
 a
 Colombian


rebel
 group.


By
 most
 measures,
 the
 US
 economy
 looks


pretty
 good
 right
 now.
 Consumer
 spending


is
 growing,
 so
 is
 GDP.
 But
 once
 you


drill
 down,
 the
 rich
 are
 doing
 well.
 But


a
 lot
 of
 other
 people
 are
 struggling.


>> Ben
 Castleman
 is
 the
 Times
 chief


economics
 correspondent.
 He's
 been


reporting
 on
 a
 growing
 divide
 in
 the


economy
 between
 the
 highest
 earners


who've
 been
 buoied
 by
 a
 stock
 market


that
 keeps
 setting
 records
 and
 the


lowest
 earners
 who
 are
 feeling
 the
 pinch


of
 persistent
 inflation
 and
 a
 slowing


job
 market.


>> In
 recent
 months,
 the
 twotrack
 nature
 of


the
 economy
 has
 really
 become


particularly
 stark.
 By
 one
 estimate,
 the


top
 10%
 of
 households
 by
 income
 now


account
 for
 nearly
 half
 of
 all
 spending,


the
 most
 since
 the
 late
 1980s.
 The


pattern
 is
 is
 showing
 up
 throughout
 the


economy.
 Airlines
 report
 booming
 sales


for
 first
 and
 business
 class
 tickets,


but
 they're
 having
 trouble
 filling
 the


cheaper
 seats
 at
 the
 back
 of
 the
 plane.


Credit
 card
 companies
 are
 in
 an
 arms


race
 to
 offer
 pricey
 cards
 with


exclusive
 perks
 to
 wellto-do
 customers,


but
 lower
 income
 households
 are


struggling
 to
 make
 minimum
 payments
 on


their
 debts.
 According
 to
 economic


policy
 experts
 Ben
 talked
 to,
 that


divergence
 between
 the
 rich
 and
 the
 poor


in
 the
 US
 could
 mean
 the
 economy
 is
 more


fragile
 than
 many
 indicators
 suggest.


with
 one
 saying,
 quote,
 "As
 the
 wealthy


continue
 to
 consume,
 that's
 masking
 more


and
 more
 insecurity
 and
 instability.

And
 finally,


>> yesterday
 morning
 in
 Paris,
 half
 an
 hour


after
 the
 Louv
 opened,
 the
 truck
 with
 a


ladder
 attached
 to
 it
 pulled
 up
 to
 the


south
 side
 of
 the
 building


and
 raised
 two
 seavves
 up
 to
 the
 second


floor
 balcony.


They
 used
 a
 grinder
 to
 break
 in
 through


the
 window
 and
 then
 burst
 into
 one
 of


the
 gilded
 galleries
 that
 hold
 the


Louv's
 crown
 jewels.
 My
 colleague


Katherine
 Porter
 is
 based
 in
 Paris.


>> Once
 inside
 the
 museum,
 the
 thieves
 who


had
 masks
 on
 set
 off
 the
 alarms,
 but


they
 managed
 to
 break
 into
 two
 cases
 and


take
 things
 like
 royal
 emerald
 necklace


and
 matching
 earrings,
 a
 tiara
 with
 a


ton
 of
 pearls
 on
 it.
 They
 quickly
 headed


back
 down
 the
 ladder,
 jumped
 on
 their


motorbikes,
 and
 roared
 off.
 The
 entire


thing
 lasted
 only
 7
 minutes.
 It
 was
 one


of
 the
 most
 brazen
 and
 probably
 costly


heists
 in
 French
 history.


The
 city
 was
 shocked.
 The
 mayor
 of


central
 Paris,
 he
 said
 it
 was
 like
 a


movie.
 Couldn't
 believe
 it.
 The
 lube
 was


quickly
 shut
 down.
 People,
 thousands
 of


them
 who
 were
 already
 in
 the
 building


ushered
 out.
 A
 criminal
 investigation


was
 launched.
 But
 at
 this
 point,
 we
 have


no
 details
 of
 what
 they
 have
 found.
 This


theft
 speaks
 to
 an
 issue
 that
 multiple


museums
 across
 the
 country
 are
 facing.


In
 the
 past,
 even
 months,
 we've
 seen


many
 thefts
 at
 museums.
 But
 the
 fact


that
 this
 was
 done
 in
 broad
 daylight


speaks
 to
 a
 growing
 audacity
 of
 thieves


who
 are
 willing
 to
 strike
 in
 the
 open.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines
 today
 on
 the


daily.
 A
 deeper
 look
 at
 what's
 happening


in
 the
 American
 economy
 and
 why
 the


stock
 market
 keeps
 going
 up
 and
 up
 and


up.
 You
 can
 listen
 to
 that
 in
 the
 New


York
 Times
 app
 or
 wherever
 you
 get
 your


podcasts.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 We'll
 be


back
 tomorrow.
