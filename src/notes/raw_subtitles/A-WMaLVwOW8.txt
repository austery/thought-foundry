 behaviors
 and
 so


on
 and
 so
 today
 we'll

 and
 timing
 like
 when
 okay


so
 welcome
 Dan
 thank
 you
 thank
 you
 great


to
 be
 here
 so
 your
 latest
 book
 um
 the


power
 of
 regret
 explores
 that
 we
 should


kind
 of
 learn
 from
 our
 regrets
 Now
 My


Philosophy
 has
 always
 been
 to
 kind
 of


try
 to
 learn
 from
 it
 and
 move
 on
 but
 you


think
 a
 bit
 differently
 no
 I
 think


that's
 I
 think
 we're
 we're
 actually


we're
 actually
 fairly
 close
 what
 I'm


really
 pushing
 back
 against
 is
 this
 idea


especially
 here
 in
 America
 where
 people


say
 I
 don't
 have
 any
 regrets
 everything


happens
 for
 a
 reason
 that
 the
 path
 to
 a


life
 well
 lived
 is
 to
 be
 positive
 all


the
 time
 never
 be
 negative
 to
 always


look
 forward
 never
 look
 back
 and
 that
 is


Prof
 profoundly
 bad
 advice
 okay
 you


mentioned
 that
 there
 are
 uh
 several


types
 of
 regrets
 I
 think
 you
 divide
 them


into
 four
 and
 one
 is
 the
 fation
 regret


right
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 didn't
 work


harder
 yeah
 so
 well
 you
 worked
 hard
 you


you
 did
 a
 law
 degree
 at
 Yale
 so
 you
 must


have
 very
 hard
 but
 but
 the
 yeah
 so
 so
 so


just
 to
 give
 it
 just
 to
 give
 some


context
 to
 this
 what
 I
 did
 is
 I
 I
 did
 a


uh
 I
 gathered
 regrets
 from
 people
 all


over
 the
 world
 I
 put
 an
 online
 survey
 uh


a
 qualitative
 piece
 of
 research
 and
 we


now
 have
 a
 database
 of
 regrets
 from


about
 26,000
 people
 in
 134
 countries
 so


it's
 it's
 pretty
 remarkable
 and
 around


the
 world
 it
 seemed
 people
 had
 the
 same


four
 core
 regrets
 one
 of
 them
 was
 this


regret
 that
 I
 call
 Foundation
 regret


which
 is
 actually
 it's
 interesting
 it


because
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 financial


component
 to
 it
 it's
 small
 decisions


people
 make
 early
 in
 life
 no
 single
 one


of
 which
 is
 cataclysmic
 but
 that
 leads


to
 terrible
 consequences
 later
 on
 and
 so


the
 classic
 one
 is
 I
 spent
 too
 much
 and


saved
 too
 little
 and
 now
 I'm
 broke
 now


you
 say
 you
 should
 tell
 people
 about


your
 regrets
 right
 yeah
 uh
 why
 a
 couple


of
 reasons
 number
 one
 it's
 an


unburdening
 of
 sorts
 uh
 that
 there
 is


there's
 some
 evidence
 that
 when
 we
 uh


it's
 sort
 of
 a
 lifting
 of
 the
 weight
 of


your
 shoulders
 but
 I
 think
 there's
 a


more
 important
 one
 with
 more
 important


reason
 than
 simply
 the
 unburdening
 and


it's
 this
 it's
 a
 there's
 a
 sensemaking


function
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 evidence
 about


this
 um
 when
 people
 uh
 write
 about
 their


regrets
 or
 talk
 about
 their
 regrets


there's
 a
 transformation
 that


occurs
 regret
 like
 all
 negative
 emotions


is
 Blobby
 it's
 amorphous
 it's
 vapor


when
 we
 write
 about
 them
 or
 talk
 about


them
 we
 convert
 that
 vapor
 into
 words


which
 are
 concrete
 and
 those
 are
 less


menacing
 and
 we
 can
 scrutinize
 them
 we


can
 analyze
 them
 we
 can
 interrogate
 them


so
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 there's
 a


very
 strong
 uh
 argument
 for
 doing
 that


what's
 more
 you
 mentioned
 leadership


before
 we
 we
 make
 a
 forecasting
 error


sometimes
 when
 we
 say
 if
 we
 talk
 about


our
 mistakes
 or
 our
 vulnerabilities


people
 will
 think
 less
 of
 us
 and
 in
 many


cases
 not
 all
 but
 in
 many
 cases
 they


actually
 think
 more
 of
 us
 they
 admire


cander
 they
 admire
 our
 courage
 well


nobody
 likes
 perfect
 people
 that's
 true


too
 I
 mean
 that's
 a
 more
 parsimonious


explanation
 one
 um
 kind
 of
 last
 fun


thing
 from
 the
 book
 I
 thought
 was
 that


you
 uh
 photograph
 uh
 the
 Olympic
 uh
 kind


of
 Champions
 right
 the
 gold
 medal


winners
 really
 happy
 and
 the
 bronze


people
 really
 happy
 the
 silver
 people


not
 happy
 what's
 that
 about
 well
 it's


interesting
 this
 is
 a
 really
 interesting


piece
 of
 so
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 you
 have
 a


background
 in
 social
 psychology
 this
 is


one
 of
 those
 very
 provocative
 findings


in
 Social
 psychology
 that
 has
 been


replicated
 multiple
 times
 so
 uh
 uh
 it's


it's
 goes
 back
 to
 counterfactual


thinking
 there
 are
 two
 kinds
 of


counterfactual
 thinking
 we
 can
 do
 we
 can


do
 a
 downward
 counterfactual
 and
 an


upward
 counterfactual
 all
 right
 an


upward
 counterfactual
 is
 when
 we
 imagine


how
 things
 could
 have
 been
 better
 upward


counterfactuals
 that's
 a
 regret
 they


make
 us
 feel
 worse
 but
 they
 can
 help
 us


do
 better
 downward
 counterfactuals
 are


when
 you
 imagine
 how
 things
 could
 have


been
 worse
 so
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 in
 the


database
 particularly
 when
 it
 comes
 to


romantic
 regrets
 mostly
 women
 saying
 I


regret
 marrying
 that
 idiot
 but
 at
 least


I
 have
 these
 two
 great
 kids
 so
 I
 can


imagine
 how
 things
 could
 have
 turned
 out


worse
 in
 the
 in
 the
 Olympic
 medal


example
 the
 the
 silver
 medalist
 was
 like


ah
 if
 only
 I
 write
 about
 a
 bike
 race
 if


only
 I
 pedal
 a
 little
 bit
 faster
 I
 could


have
 been
 a
 gold
 medalist
 the
 the
 bronze


medalist
 is
 like
 H
 at
 least
 I
 finished


third
 rather
 than
 that
 Schmo
 who


finished
 fourth
 who
 doesn't
 have
 any


medals
 at


all
 do
 cosos
 have
 stronger
 drives
 than


others
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 mean
 it
 probably


depends
 on
 the
 probably
 depends
 on
 the


CEO
 if
 you
 pressed
 me
 to
 the
 wall
 and


said
 you
 had
 and
 I
 had
 offer
 a
 yes
 no


answer
 to
 that
 I
 would
 say
 no
 um
 I
 just


think
 you
 know
 CEOs
 could
 be
 CEOs
 not


because
 they
 have
 a
 stronger
 drive


because
 they're
 they're
 Wier
 they're


better
 at
 politics
 um
 they're
 they're


you
 know
 they're
 they're
 they're
 tall
 uh


they're
 male
 uh
 they're
 more
 conformist


so
 that
 could
 be
 why
 they're
 CEOs
 too


rather
 than
 rather
 they
 have
 some
 kind


of
 innate
 drive
 that
 separates
 them
 from


the
 great
 unwashed
 who
 aren't
 CEOs
 so


when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 the
 cohort
 of
 CEOs


what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you
 think
 it
 depends


I
 mean
 it's
 it's
 it's
 varied
 I
 think


there's
 a
 big
 difference
 between
 a
 CEO


who
 comes
 up
 through
 the
 ranks
 and
 a
 CEO


who
 is
 a
 Founder
 first
 of
 all
 I
 think


those
 are
 two
 they
 both
 have
 the
 same


name
 CEO
 but
 I
 think
 that
 they're


different


species
 so
 what
 do
 you
 so
 how
 do
 you
 st


they
 so
 you
 should
 do
 W
 inam
 morning


okay
 so
 um
 for
 the
 80%
 of
 us
 who
 are
 not


night
 owls
 now
 night
 we
 have
 an
 outlier


here
 the
 people
 who
 are
 the
 opposite
 of


you
 who
 naturally
 wake
 up
 late
 and
 go
 to


sleep
 late
 who
 we
 think
 are
 Laz
 and
 the


nightclubs
 exactly
 we
 think
 that
 those


people
 are
 diletant
 and
 not
 serious
 they


just
 have
 a
 different
 chrony
 many
 of


them
 just
 have
 a
 different
 chronotype
 um


let's
 take
 the
 80%
 of
 us
 who
 are
 either


like
 you
 or
 like
 me
 here's
 what
 you


should
 do
 early
 in
 the
 day
 that's
 when


we
 should
 do
 our
 analytic
 work
 and


analytic
 work
 is
 work
 that
 requires


heads
 down
 Focus
 and
 attention
 writing


is
 a
 good
 example
 of
 that
 analyzing
 data


figuring
 out
 a
 strategy
 something
 that


requires
 heads
 down
 Focus
 the
 reason
 for


that
 is
 that
 is
 that
 during
 this
 peak


period
 that
 we
 have
 mostly
 early
 in
 the


day
 for
 most
 of
 us
 we're
 most
 we're
 more


Vigilant
 we're
 able
 to
 batle
 away


distractions
 so
 do
 your
 analytic
 work


early
 in
 the
 day
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 day


early
 afternoon
 mid-afternoon


it's
 generally
 a
 terrible
 time
 of
 day


and
 we
 see
 Inc
 there's
 incredible


research
 on
 like
 health
 like
 errors
 in


healthcare
 in
 the
 afternoon
 lack
 of


handwashing
 in
 the
 the
 healthc
 care
 data


you
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 an
 operation
 in


the
 he
 you
 absolutely
 do
 not
 nobody
 in


my
 family
 is
 permitted
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 get


hit
 by
 a
 bus
 and
 there's
 no
 other
 choice


yeah
 but
 a
 discretionary
 there
 is
 nobody


in
 my
 family
 who
 is
 permitted
 to
 have
 a


medical
 procedure
 in
 the
 afternoon
 I'm


not
 I'm
 not
 joking


around
 Dad
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 good
 breaks


the
 the
 conceptual
 key
 to
 breaks
 and


this
 is


important
 um
 is
 um
 thinking
 of
 breaks
 as


part
 of
 your
 work
 rather
 than
 a


deviation
 from
 your
 work
 number
 one


something
 is
 better
 than
 nothing
 so
 even


a
 short
 break
 is
 better
 than
 no
 break
 at


all
 second
 uh
 social
 is
 better
 than
 solo


so
 that
 breaks
 with
 other
 people
 are


more
 restorative
 than
 breaks
 on
 your
 own


even
 with
 uh
 even
 for
 introverts
 we
 know


not
 a
 surprise
 moving
 is
 better
 than


stationary
 so
 a
 break
 my
 having
 a
 break


here
 sitting
 staring
 at
 the
 space
 not
 as


good
 as
 just
 going
 out
 and
 for
 a
 walk


very
 interesting
 for
 um
 I
 I
 think
 around


the
 world
 is
 outside
 is
 better
 than


inside
 and
 this
 to
 me
 is
 one
 of
 those


insights
 in
 science
 that
 is


underappreciated
 the
 advantage
 of
 being


outside
 the
 advantage
 of
 being
 and
 I


don't
 mean
 in
 National
 Park
 I
 mean
 you


and
 I
 are
 talking
 here
 in
 Washington
 DC


taking
 a
 walk
 outside
 in
 Washington
 DC


and
 seeing
 the
 trees
 um
 and
 then
 finally


uh
 the
 The
 Importance
 of
 breakes
 Being


fully
 detached
 does
 it
 mean
 that
 taking


a
 break
 into
 your
 desk
 and
 looking
 at
 at


the
 screen
 is
 a
 good
 thing
 it's
 probably


not
 a
 good
 thing
 because
 it
 violates
 the


outside
 and
 the
 Mo
 motion
 uh
 and
 the


social
 side
 of
 it
 so
 uh
 it's
 probably


that's
 probably
 a
 bad
 that's
 that's
 a


suboptimal
 kind
 of
 break
 yeah
 the


optimal
 kind
 of
 break
 is
 in
 the


afternoon
 go
 out
 for
 a
 walk
 15
 20


minutes
 with
 someone
 you
 like
 leaving


your
 phone
 behind
 talking
 about


something
 other
 than
 work
 that's
 a
 good


break
 naps
 naps
 I've
 I
 this
 is
 this
 is


one
 of
 those
 cases
 where
 the
 science


changed
 my
 position
 my
 political


position
 I
 was
 politically
 opposed
 to


naps
 because
 I
 thought
 they
 were
 a
 sign


of
 laziness
 uh
 and
 I
 always
 felt


terrible
 if
 I
 ever
 to
 I
 didn't
 take
 naps


very
 often
 if
 I
 took
 a
 nap
 I
 always
 felt


terrible
 I
 would
 wake
 up
 really
 groggy


sort
 of
 ashamed
 of
 myself
 um
 what
 what


it
 shows
 is
 that
 problem
 I
 had
 was
 that


every
 time
 I
 took
 a
 break
 my
 boss
 came


in
 and
 thought
 I


was
 so
 bad
 but
 now
 this
 and
 the
 reason


why
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 it
 now
 is
 so


that
 everybody
 understands
 that
 I'm


taking
 that
 I'm
 taking
 it
 up
 for
 a


reason
 a
 good
 reason
 it's
 a
 sign
 it's
 a


you're
 if
 you
 walk
 into
 nikolai's
 office


and
 he's
 taking
 a
 break
 it's
 just


another
 marker
 that
 he's
 an
 extremely


high
 perform
 that's
 how
 you
 should


interpret
 that
 thank
 you
