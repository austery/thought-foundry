when
 you
 democratize
 technology
 and
 you


put
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 of
 almost
 everybody,


you
 empower
 everyone.
 AI
 is
 uh
 be
 the


biggest
 thing
 in
 this
 decade.
 I
 would


say
 we
 are
 at
 the
 very
 very
 beginning
 of


using
 machine
 learning
 really
 in
 every


way
 in
 which
 we
 uh
 connect
 with
 the


world.
 We
 are
 very
 excited
 about
 you


know
 look
 I've
 been
 in
 the
 semiconductor


industry
 you
 know
 over
 30
 years
 and


there
 were
 times
 when
 nobody
 knew
 what
 a


semiconductor
 was
 but
 uh
 today
 I
 think


everybody
 um
 at
 least
 appreciates
 that


you
 know
 semiconductors
 and
 chips
 can


help
 power
 uh
 numerous
 things.
 I
 think


it's
 just
 a
 pregame
 show.
 I
 think
 we're


we're
 just
 getting
 to
 the
 the
 more


interesting
 part
 where
 technology
 is
 is


going
 to
 have
 a
 much
 bigger
 role
 in


progressing
 the
 world
 forward.
 potential


value
 of
 AI
 is
 to
 be
 able
 to
 accelerate


our
 uh
 learning
 cycle.
 So
 in
 some
 way


accelerate
 R&D.
 So
 the
 willow
 chip
 is


able
 to
 um
 to
 handle
 a
 computation
 in


less
 than
 5
 minutes
 that
 previously
 on


the
 best
 supercomputers
 on
 the
 planet


today
 would
 take
 10
 septillion
 years.
 So


the
 cloud
 is
 essentially
 the
 ability
 for


companies
 of
 all
 sizes,
 all
 types
 to
 run


all
 their
 infrastructure
 in
 a
 way
 that


feels
 infinite
 and
 like
 it
 has
 no


specific
 place.
 Um
 I
 know
 that
 for
 a


fact
 that
 there's
 no
 such
 thing
 as
 a


franchise
 value.
 And
 so
 that
 means
 every


day
 you
 have
 to
 get
 up
 and
 hopefully


you're
 doing
 things
 that
 are
 going
 to
 be


relevant
 tomorrow.
 What
 we're
 trying
 to


do
 is
 see
 where
 the
 technology
 takes
 us,


deploy
 it
 into
 the
 world
 to
 actually


understand
 how
 people
 are
 using
 it,


where
 the
 risks
 are,
 where
 the
 benefits


are,
 what
 people
 want,
 how
 how how


they'd
 like
 it
 to
 evolve,
 and
 then
 sort


of
 co-evolve
 the
 technology
 with


society.


All
 right,
 everyone,
 a
 warm
 welcome
 to


us
 here
 at
 MBIM
 and
 thank
 you
 for
 taking


time
 out
 of your
 lives
 to
 spend
 that


with
 us
 this
 afternoon
 and
 evening.
 So


we
 are
 really
 happy
 to
 have
 you
 here.
 We


have
 a
 great
 set
 of
 presentations
 about


the
 technology
 and
 security
 stack
 that


we
 have.
 But
 first
 uh
 let
 us
 introduce


ourselves.
 We
 will
 be
 your
 hosts
 this


evening.
 My
 name
 is
 Gunund.
 Uh
 I
 am
 head


of
 a
 market
 exposure
 delivery
 team.
 And


what
 I
 do
 is
 that
 I
 have
 a
 set
 of


developers
 together
 with
 me
 that
 develop


our
 internally
 built
 uh
 investment


platform.


Yes.
 My
 name
 is
 Shet
 Len.
 I'm
 head
 of


data
 here
 at
 MBM.
 uh
 we
 uh
 we
 manage
 the


data
 platform
 and
 build
 uh
 the
 data


warehouse
 and
 provide
 data
 for
 for
 our


analysts.


And
 my
 name
 is
 oh
 sorry
 my
 name
 is


Selena.
 I
 work
 in
 the
 cyber
 security


center
 as
 a
 cyber
 security
 engineer.
 My


job
 is
 basically
 just
 to
 make
 sure
 that


the
 old
 fund
 is
 safe.


Yes.
 So
 there
 just
 some
 practical
 uh


things.
 So
 basically
 if
 something
 uh


happens
 we
 will
 leave
 this
 place


together.
 the
 gods
 will
 show
 us
 out.
 Uh


there
 are
 some
 toilets
 over
 there.
 Yeah,


I
 think
 that's
 more
 or
 less
 it.
 Yes.


Yeah.
 To
 kick
 off
 this
 amazing
 evening,


please
 give
 a
 warm
 welcome
 to
 our
 CTO


Vita
 Brina.


Welcome
 everyone
 to
 us
 here
 in
 the
 fund.


uh
 we
 have
 really
 been
 looking
 forward


to
 today
 and
 planned
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 Uh


we
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 incoming
 calls
 and


people
 that
 want
 to
 meet
 us
 and
 want
 to


hear
 what
 we
 are
 doing
 in
 technology
 and


then
 we
 found
 out
 that
 why
 don't
 we
 just


invite
 people
 here
 and
 then
 we
 can
 talk


about
 it
 and
 we
 can
 explore
 together
 in


the
 future
 how
 we're
 going
 to
 move


forward
 to
 bring
 this
 country
 also


moving
 forward
 in
 this
 very
 exciting


area.
 We
 see
 that
 as
 an
 investment
 firm


that
 lines
 between
 technology
 and


investments
 are
 be
 becoming
 more
 and


more
 blurred,
 more
 and
 more
 integrated


and
 that
 gives
 us
 a
 lot
 of


opportunities.
 So
 today
 we
 are
 going
 to


talk
 a
 bit
 about
 what
 we
 are
 doing
 and


sharing
 with
 you
 and
 then
 we're
 going
 to


have
 a
 social
 event
 afterwards
 so
 we
 can


get
 to
 know
 each
 other.
 So
 again
 warm


welcome
 to
 all
 of
 you.


[Applause]


At
 MBIM,


technology
 is
 a
 key
 area
 of
 focus,
 not


just
 as
 a
 support
 function
 for
 our


employees,
 but
 as
 a
 strategic
 enabler.


We
 are
 constantly
 looking
 at
 how


technology
 can
 improve
 the
 experiences


for
 our
 investment
 teams.


MBIM
 has
 been
 to
 through
 over
 the
 years


a
 significant
 technology
 journey
 from


fully
 outsourced
 operations
 to
 a
 modern


cloudnative
 environment.


In
 the
 next
 few
 moments,
 I'm
 going
 to


take
 you
 through
 this
 journey,
 a
 journey


that
 made
 it
 possible
 to
 do
 all
 the


stuff
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 this


evening.


Before


or
 before
 2017,


all
 of
 our
 technology
 was
 fully


outsourced.


We
 had
 two
 data
 centers
 in
 Amsterdam.


And
 the
 reason
 why
 we
 had
 two
 was
 simply


because
 of
 redundancy
 in
 case
 of
 one
 of


them
 went
 down.
 But
 this
 setup
 did
 give


us
 some
 challenges.


We
 had
 we
 had
 uh
 even
 a
 story
 about
 a


consultant
 that
 had
 to
 physically
 go
 to


Amsterdam
 and
 connect
 to
 the
 drivers


when
 they
 were
 down
 to
 get
 them
 back
 up


again.
 So
 that
 meant
 that
 we
 had
 to


maintain
 everything
 ourselves
 from


replication
 between
 the
 data
 centers
 to


maintenance
 and
 when
 uh
 maintenance
 and


fixed
 when
 downtime
 occurred.


Procurement
 also
 had
 its
 problems.


Something
 as
 simple
 as
 replacing
 discs


could
 take
 months
 due
 to
 delays
 in
 the


supply
 chain.
 So
 in
 short,
 we
 had
 to


handle
 every
 aspect
 of
 the


infrastructure
 on
 our
 ourselves
 and
 this


from
 an
 operational
 standpoint
 was
 far


from
 ideal.


So
 in
 2017
 we
 launched
 the
 ISAC
 project


a
 project
 that
 was
 significant
 in
 our


technology
 journey.
 It
 focused
 on
 four


key
 pillars.
 Insourcing
 we
 wanted
 the


best
 talent
 inhouse
 and
 build
 internal


expertise
 rather
 than
 relying
 on
 heavily


on
 consultants.


security.
 We
 focused
 on
 strengthening


our
 security
 posture
 which
 was
 top


priority
 across
 the
 entire
 organization.


Automation
 with
 fewer
 in-house


developers
 than
 consultants.
 We
 knew


that
 automation
 was
 essential.
 So


infrastructure
 as
 core
 became
 a


infrastructure
 as
 code
 became
 a
 core


part
 of
 increasing
 efficiency.


Lastly,
 cloud.
 We
 went
 all
 in
 on
 the


cloud.


Strong
 internal
 support
 uh
 ended
 up
 with


us
 choosing
 AWS
 as
 our
 cloud
 provider


and
 we
 started
 our
 migration
 to
 AWS
 in


2018
 and
 by
 2019
 this
 transformation
 was


complete.


So
 between
 2017
 and
 now
 MBM
 has
 built
 a


modern
 development
 environment.
 An


environment
 that
 allows
 our
 developers


to
 deliver
 futures
 features
 to
 our


investment
 teams
 quickly
 and


efficiently.


We
 have
 a
 setup
 that
 gives
 developers


the
 tools,
 the
 autonomy,
 and
 the
 support


they
 need
 to
 do
 this
 fast
 without


compromising
 quality
 and
 security.


Crucially,
 all
 of
 this
 has
 only
 been


possible
 due
 to
 strong
 support
 from
 our


leadership
 group.
 With
 their
 push
 on
 a


cloud
 first
 strategy,
 we
 now
 have


created
 foundation
 for
 innovation.


This
 has
 made
 it
 possible
 for
 us
 to
 test


new
 advanced
 technologies
 such
 as
 AI.
 We


are
 integrating
 AI
 in
 our
 daily
 life
 to


streamline
 processes
 to
 uh
 boost
 our


productivity
 and
 to
 make
 smarter


decision.
 So
 today
 you
 will
 see
 all
 the


cool
 stuff
 that
 we
 have
 been
 able
 to


build
 as
 a
 result
 of
 this.
 So
 I
 please


feel
 free
 to
 present
 our
 f
 first


presenter.
 All right.
 So
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 we
 have
 uh
 used
 this


platform
 for
 is
 to
 build
 this
 internal


investment
 platform.
 So
 we
 buy
 when
 we


can
 we
 buy
 software
 when
 we
 can
 but
 we


build
 when
 we
 have
 to
 when
 our


requirements
 are
 so
 specific
 and
 unique


that
 nobody
 can
 deliver
 us
 the
 software


that
 we
 need.
 So
 this
 is
 also
 what
 I


spend
 most
 of
 my
 time
 on.
 But
 um
 now
 to


present
 this
 um
 we
 will
 have
 our
 UX
 UI


designer
 Helena
 Stavo
 present
 our


internal
 system
 in
 a
 presentation
 she


has
 she
 has
 called
 managing
 complexity


through
 the
 burden
 of
 really
 big


numbers.
 Helena


hello
 everyone.
 So
 nice
 to
 see
 all
 of


you.
 I've
 been
 really
 excited
 to
 tell


you
 about
 what
 I'm
 working
 on
 all
 day,


every
 day,
 thinking
 about
 when
 I
 sleep


at
 night
 and
 all
 of
 that.
 Um,
 let's
 see


it.
 Yes.
 Okay.
 In
 1996,
 two
 very


important
 things
 happened.
 I
 was
 born


and
 the
 first
 first
 deposit
 was
 made


into
 the
 account
 of


1.9
 billion
 Norwegian
 croners.


As
 you
 all
 know
 that
 number
 is
 huge


today.
 It
 is
 so
 much
 more.
 It
 is


actually
 Can
 you
 read
 this?
 Can
 anybody


read
 this?
 Hands
 up.
 I
 actually
 uh


before
 I
 had
 my
 first
 interview
 here,
 I


sat
 down
 and
 studied
 this
 number
 because


I
 was
 like
 what
 if
 they
 ask
 me
 what
 this


number
 is?
 So
 this
 is
 19,000
 billion


Norwegian
 croners.
 U
 which
 is
 so
 huge


that
 you
 can't
 really
 understand
 it.
 So


I've
 um
 made
 some
 small
 visualizations


here
 to
 maybe
 make
 you
 understand
 it.


What
 if
 we
 were
 to
 uh
 cover
 the
 entire


ground
 with
 Norwegian
 one
 croners?
 Uh
 so


we
 were
 to
 sell
 all
 of
 our
 assets
 and
 uh


have
 19,000
 billion
 Norwegian
 croners
 uh


on
 the
 ground.
 Uh
 so
 everywhere
 you


walked
 you
 would
 step
 on
 money


basically.
 Uh
 that
 would
 cover
 this


area.
 So,
 you
 could
 almost
 work
 to
 uh


walk
 to
 Bergen
 uh
 from
 Oslo
 and
 walk
 on


money,
 which
 is
 uh
 pretty
 stupid.
 So,
 I


don't
 think
 we're
 gonna
 do
 that.
 Um
 or


we
 could
 stack
 this
 money
 on
 top
 of
 each


other
 uh
 and
 maybe
 win
 the
 space
 race
 if


we
 were
 to
 climb
 on
 top
 of
 this
 money


because
 that
 would
 take
 us
 33
 million


kilometers
 into
 space
 reaching
 beyond


Venus,
 which
 is
 also
 pretty
 uh
 crazy.
 So


the
 number
 itself
 is
 big
 but
 the
 daily


operations
 here
 are
 also
 incredibly


enormous
 in
 size.
 So
 each
 day
 we
 have


transactions
 going
 through
 the
 walls
 at


embim
 of
 450
 million
 croners.
 That
 is


more
 than
 uh
 is
 traded
 at
 version
 every


single
 day
 and
 it
 is
 a
 fourth
 of
 the


state
 budget
 that
 we
 handle
 here
 every


single
 day.
 Crazy.


What
 makes
 this
 even
 more
 complex
 is


that
 uh
 some
 or
 most
 investment
 firms


focus
 on
 one
 portfolio
 but
 NBIM
 as
 a


whole
 is
 one
 portfolio.
 We
 want
 uh
 all


sub
 portfolios
 at
 NBIM
 to
 be
 um
 doing
 or


performing
 great.
 So
 NBIM
 is
 um
 divided


into
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 portfolios
 for


several
 reasons.
 We
 have
 different


investment
 and
 asset
 classes.
 we
 have


different
 sectors
 we
 want
 to
 be


performing
 well
 in
 etc.
 So
 to
 try
 to


keep
 track
 of
 this
 um
 it's
 very


important
 to
 have
 an
 overview
 of
 uh


where
 everybody
 is
 investing.
 This
 can


mean
 that
 if
 I
 was
 a
 portfolio
 uh


manager
 for
 example
 wanting
 to
 uh
 buy


stocks
 in
 uh
 Rose
 Company
 Co.
 Then
 uh
 I


would
 check
 internally
 first
 if
 there


was
 somebody
 else
 in
 NVIM
 wanting
 to


sell
 something
 in
 Rose
 Company
 Co.


because
 this
 happens
 a
 lot.
 We
 have


different
 um
 responsibilities
 here
 that


sometimes
 you
 would
 want
 to
 sell


something
 when
 your
 colleague
 would
 want


to
 buy
 something.
 Doing
 this
 uh
 and


having
 an
 overview
 of
 this
 actually


saves
 us
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 We're
 speaking


billions
 here.
 uh
 we
 usually
 are


speaking
 billions
 here
 but
 uh


and
 it
 makes
 NBIM
 the
 biggest


marketplace
 that
 you
 have
 never
 heard


of.
 So


all
 of
 this
 we
 have
 to
 manage
 somewhere


and
 one
 of
 the
 places
 we
 are
 managing


this
 is
 in
 Pulis.
 Pulis
 is
 what
 I
 work


on
 every
 day
 and
 that
 is
 NBIM's
 main


platform
 for
 portfolio
 management
 and


trading.


Before
 we
 had
 Pilates,
 we
 had
 a
 ton
 of


different
 tools.
 What
 is
 really,
 really


cool
 about
 working
 here
 at
 MBIM
 is
 that


everyone
 is
 incredibly
 smart.
 It's
 kind


of
 daunting
 to
 start
 working
 here
 and


realizing
 that
 everybody
 knows
 a
 lot


about
 everything,
 which
 is
 really
 cool.


So,
 we
 have
 quite
 a
 few
 portfolio


managers
 and
 traders
 that
 code


themselves
 and
 make
 supporting


applications.
 And
 we
 have
 um
 in
 return,


we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 applications


that
 needs
 to
 be
 maintained.
 And
 what
 is


also
 very
 particular
 about
 MBM
 is
 that


we
 are
 not
 that
 many
 people
 that
 you


might
 think.
 So
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 money


but
 there
 are
 not
 that
 many
 people
 that


actually
 manage
 this.
 So
 um
 what
 ends
 up


happening
 happening
 is
 that
 each
 person


has
 very
 very very
 specific
 needs.


Oops.
 So,
 how
 do
 we
 take
 all
 of
 these


different
 applications
 and
 consolidate


consolidate
 them
 into
 one
 platform
 while


still
 keeping
 the
 speed
 and
 agility
 for


each
 person
 that
 uses
 it?
 And
 speed
 is


the
 key
 word
 here
 because
 one
 click


again
 is
 worth
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 So,
 if


you
 spend
 too
 much
 time
 getting


somewhere
 then
 that
 might
 be
 a
 very
 bad


thing.


Yes.
 So,
 um
 this
 is
 Pilates.
 Um,
 Pilates


is
 not
 just
 what
 you
 see,
 but
 it
 is
 a


lot
 of
 work
 that
 lies
 behind
 the


application
 that
 I
 will
 of
 course
 show


you
 afterwards.
 Uh,
 Pilates
 consists
 of


a
 backend
 that
 uh
 lets
 um
 developers
 uh


build
 their
 own
 nodes
 and
 endpoints


directly
 into
 the
 back
 end
 to
 build


front-end
 applications
 and
 or
 reports


directly
 into
 uh
 one
 common
 and


collaborative
 platform.


What
 is
 a
 really
 key
 uh
 user
 benefit
 for


this
 is
 that
 we
 pull
 all
 core
 systems


into
 the
 same
 backend
 which
 again
 in


return
 makes
 it
 a
 lot
 easier
 for
 our


users
 to
 use
 because
 they
 no
 longer
 have


to
 go
 into
 several
 different


applications
 to
 perform
 everyday


actions.


And
 then
 on
 top
 of
 that
 we
 have
 um
 the


application
 itself
 which
 is
 built
 using


UX
 and
 business
 knowledge
 which
 again
 is


very
 very
 important
 for
 uh
 scalability


reasons.
 If
 we
 think
 ahead
 and
 try
 to


look
 at
 the
 platform
 as
 a
 whole
 it's
 a


lot
 easier
 to
 have
 a
 platform
 that
 will


live
 on
 for
 many
 years
 to
 come.


This
 is
 uh
 some
 small
 images
 of
 Pilates


the
 platform.


We
 are
 building
 everything
 inhouse
 and


that
 is
 very
 very
 very
 important.
 We
 are


not
 like
 any
 other
 investment
 firm.
 It's


super
 important
 that
 we
 can
 control
 the


entire
 process
 and
 here
 we
 actually


control
 absolutely
 everything.
 So
 the


close
 icon
 in
 the
 top
 left
 corner
 could


be
 a
 smiley
 face,
 maybe
 a
 sad
 smiley


face.
 Are
 you
 closing
 me
 now?
 Um
 yes.
 So


we
 are
 controlling
 absolutely
 everything


and
 that
 lets
 us
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 cool


things.
 The
 main
 feature
 of
 Pilates
 is


flexibility.


Each
 person
 that
 uses
 Pilates
 um
 we're


on
 firstname
 basis
 with
 everyone
 really.


So
 I
 know
 exactly
 what
 each
 person
 wants


and
 they
 are
 able
 to
 get
 exactly
 that
 in


Pilates.
 Previously
 we
 had
 a
 lot
 of


static
 tables
 etc.
 But
 now
 they're
 able


to
 build
 their
 own
 uh
 user
 interface
 and


pull
 in
 components
 that
 they
 can
 then


rearrange
 as
 they
 would
 like
 and
 see


exactly
 what
 they
 need
 when
 they
 need


it.


All
 of
 these
 components
 then
 listen
 into


a
 data
 channel
 where
 we
 prefilter
 the


data
 that
 they
 see.
 This
 makes
 it
 a
 lot


easier
 for
 them
 to
 actually
 have
 a


stable
 and
 reliable
 platform
 or
 for
 us


to
 give
 them
 a
 stable
 and
 reliable


platform
 because
 we
 don't
 give
 them


everything
 up
 front.
 Uh
 we
 have
 had
 a


rework
 of
 the
 prolitus
 platform
 and


previously
 it
 was
 very
 difficult
 to
 load


the
 biggest
 portfolios.
 Uh
 it
 would
 stop


completely
 and
 um
 it's
 not
 that
 weird


because
 the
 main
 portfolio
 has
 over


15,000
 rows.
 So
 that
 sort
 of
 makes
 sense


that
 it's
 uh
 difficult
 to
 load
 all
 of


that
 data.
 But
 uh
 now
 we're
 able
 to


filter
 that
 out
 and
 provide
 some
 speed


and
 um
 agility
 there.


But
 it's
 not
 only
 the
 layout
 itself
 that


is
 flexible.
 We
 are
 also
 making
 the
 data


itself
 flexible
 so
 that
 users
 can
 build


their
 own
 reports
 and
 mix
 and
 match


columns
 and
 data
 as
 they
 would
 like.


before.
 Now
 we've
 had
 a
 very
 manual


process
 where
 a
 developer
 would
 have
 to


go
 in
 and
 build
 a
 table
 or
 a
 graph
 or


whatever
 it
 may
 be
 for
 the
 um
 for
 the


portfolio
 managers
 and
 traders.
 Whereas


now
 very
 soon
 they
 will
 be
 able
 to
 do


absolutely
 everything
 themselves
 and


pull
 and
 drag
 and
 drop
 data
 as
 they


would
 like
 as
 well.


I'm
 going
 to
 give
 you
 a
 very
 quick
 u


demo
 of
 how
 a
 normal
 person
 or
 a
 normal


portfolio
 manager
 would
 spend
 their
 time


in
 Pilates.


This
 is
 a
 sketch
 uh
 because
 I'm
 not


allowed
 to
 show
 you
 the
 real
 deal
 from


right
 now
 unfortunately.
 So
 don't
 base


your
 investments
 on
 this
 because
 you


will
 be
 very
 disappointed.


Actually
 I
 think
 I'm
 gonna
 just
 jump
 up


here.
 Um
 you
 over
 there
 can
 see
 as
 well.


Okay.
 So,
 uh
 this
 is
 the
 portfolio
 table


overview.
 It's
 a
 preset
 that
 we
 have


made
 for
 the
 portfolio
 managers.
 And


what
 most
 of
 them
 use
 this
 for
 is
 to
 get


a
 good
 grip
 of
 what
 are
 my
 holdings.
 So,


where
 are
 they
 today?
 Um
 where
 is
 it


opposed
 to
 the
 benchmark
 because
 that's


what
 everybody
 is
 uh
 looking
 towards.
 Am


I
 close
 or
 far
 away
 from
 the
 benchmark?


So,
 um
 right
 here,
 this
 is
 why
 I
 have
 to


stand
 up
 here.
 Now
 we
 have
 uh
 the


benchmark
 column
 it
 says
 100
 and
 then
 we


have
 uh
 the
 holdings
 column
 says
 97.
 So


we
 are
 minus3
 and
 I
 want
 that
 to
 get
 to


a
 zero.
 So
 I'm
 going
 to
 write
 zero
 in


the
 um
 in
 the
 simulations
 column
 and


then
 uh
 it
 automatically
 populates
 the


simulations
 beneath.
 And
 what
 is
 really


cool
 about
 this
 is
 that
 it
 then
 also


simulates
 the
 rest
 of
 uh
 your
 portfolio.


So
 portfolio
 managers
 are
 able
 to
 build


up
 their
 own
 uh
 trade
 programs
 and
 see


how
 this
 changes
 the
 portfolio
 as
 a


whole
 using
 uh
 these
 uh
 data
 that
 is
 all


sent
 back.


Yes.
 So
 that's
 just
 a
 short
 use
 case
 for


that.


So
 to
 summarize,
 how
 do
 we
 manage


complexity?


First
 and
 foremost,
 we
 have
 to
 make
 sure


that
 we
 are
 building
 something
 that


works
 for
 everyone
 while
 still
 being


able
 to
 uh
 be
 a
 bit
 more
 uh


customizable.


But
 most
 importantly,
 we
 have
 to
 make


sure
 that
 it
 is
 stable
 and
 reliable.
 If


the
 users
 cannot
 trust
 the
 platform
 or


trust
 the
 data,
 we
 have
 already
 failed.


So
 having
 the
 correct
 data
 structure
 in


place
 and
 architecture
 in
 place
 is


detrimental
 to
 have
 a
 good
 working


software
 to
 be
 able
 to
 handle
 all
 of


this
 complexity.


And
 then
 lastly
 is
 to
 be
 able
 to
 provide


flexibility


and
 scalability.
 So
 that
 would
 mean
 in


our
 case
 giving
 them
 the
 possibility
 to


basically
 use
 uh
 politis
 as
 a
 building


block
 to
 create
 their
 own
 perfect
 idea


of
 what
 a
 portfolio
 and
 trading
 tool


should
 be
 and
 secondly
 to
 have


principles
 in
 place
 for
 them
 to
 make
 it


not
 look
 bad.


Thank
 you
 so
 much


AI
 has
 started.
 AI
 is
 is
 the
 one
 that


I've
 been
 thinking
 about
 my
 whole
 life


and
 wondering,
 okay,
 how
 hard
 is
 it?
 How


are
 we
 going
 to
 get
 this?
 Now,
 it's


actually
 surprised
 me
 that
 we
 have
 this


acceleration.
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 make


everybody
 richer,
 but
 I
 think
 it
 impacts


positively
 impacts
 poor
 people
 the
 most.


It
 should
 be
 particularly
 true
 for
 the


democratization
 of
 intelligence.
 My


entire
 confidence
 in
 this
 generation
 of


AI
 started
 when
 I
 started
 seeing
 from


GPD
 3
 to
 35
 and
 that
 implementation
 in


GitHub.
 Now,
 ChatGpt
 is
 unquestionably


the
 single
 best
 software
 product
 the


world's
 ever
 made.
 This
 is
 the
 easiest


product
 to
 use
 on
 the
 planet.
 anybody's


anybody
 could
 use
 it.


All
 right.
 So,
 now
 we're
 going
 to
 have


um
 a
 quick
 panel
 debate
 about
 AI
 and
 uh


we
 thought
 we're
 going
 to
 discuss
 this
 u


from
 a
 couple
 of
 different
 angles.
 So,


we're
 going
 to
 discuss
 this
 from
 an


organizational
 level
 and
 then
 bring
 it


down
 to
 the
 individual
 level
 afterwards.


And
 hopefully
 also
 we
 can
 discuss
 a
 bit


or
 or
 uh
 compare
 what
 MBM
 has
 done
 our


efforts
 and
 our
 voyage
 to
 what
 other


have
 done.
 And
 to
 help
 us
 with
 that
 we


have
 invited
 our
 top
 technology


management
 and
 also
 a
 couple
 of
 external


experts
 to
 to
 help
 us
 with
 this.
 So


let's
 introduce
 them
 quickly.
 So
 we
 have


uh
 Alexandre
 Stansp.
 He
 is
 from
 grit
 AI


studio
 and
 for
 nearly
 two
 decades


Alexander
 has
 been
 leading
 digital


transformations
 but
 now
 Alexander
 is


focusing
 on
 making
 AI
 accessible
 and


practical.
 So
 he's
 building
 real


solutions
 to
 real
 world
 problems
 and
 he


does
 that
 with
 passion
 and


determinations
 which
 I
 guess
 is
 why
 you


call
 the
 company
 grit.
 A
 fun
 fact
 about


Alexander
 is
 that
 in
 addition
 to
 AI
 he


has
 a
 couple
 of
 hobbies.
 He
 really


enjoys
 running
 but
 he
 also
 enjoys


shooting.
 And
 now
 he's
 been
 able
 to


combine
 those
 into
 one
 sport.
 And
 it's


called
 um
 forest
 running
 with
 shooting.


And
 I
 guess
 um
 summer
 bialon
 is
 is
 a


more
 uh
 more
 accurate
 uh
 uh
 sentence


maybe.
 And
 he's
 actually
 currently
 the


regional
 champion
 of
 festival.


Impressive.
 Yes.
 Uh
 and
 then
 uh
 we
 have


also
 with
 us
 uh
 Dr.
 Robert
 Angels.
 He
 is


uh
 he
 runs
 Capgeemini's
 uh
 global
 AI


lab.
 Uh
 he
 has
 a
 PhD
 in
 AI
 and
 he
 has


actually
 worked
 with
 AI
 since
 before
 we


had
 cell
 phones.
 So
 definitely
 I
 look


forward
 to
 hear


before
 the
 internet
 even.
 Yes,


definitely.
 So
 a
 long
 time
 and
 before


Helena
 was
 born.
 So


yes.
 Uh
 so
 um
 fun
 fact
 about
 Robert,


he's
 an
 engineer
 by
 heart
 definitely.
 uh


he
 built
 the
 first
 sweet
 legal


motorbike,
 electric
 motorbike
 uh
 in


Norway
 and
 he
 still
 rides
 that
 one


today.
 Yeah.
 And
 then
 we
 have
 Bilit


here.
 Uh
 Brigittita
 is
 a
 chief


technology
 and
 operations
 officer.
 Uh
 so


she
 oversees
 the
 technology


infrastructure
 that
 enables
 us
 to
 manage


one
 of
 the
 largest
 portfolios
 in
 the


world
 and
 she
 has
 solid
 experience
 from


service
 technology
 leadership
 from


various
 large
 financial
 institutions.


But
 that's
 not
 the
 only
 job
 that


Brigittita
 has
 here.
 She
 has
 another


important
 role.
 She
 is
 the
 rock
 and
 roll


voice
 of
 NBIM.


So
 when
 she's
 not
 managing
 our
 tech
 and


operations,
 she
 is
 the
 lead
 singer
 of


our
 uh
 internal
 house
 band
 called


Reputational
 Risk.


Great.
 And
 uh
 last
 but
 not
 least,
 we


have
 Nikolai.
 I
 think
 five
 six
 years


ago,
 you
 would
 have
 to
 be
 very


interested
 in
 art
 or
 silos
 if
 you
 had


heard
 about
 him.
 But
 uh
 but
 no,
 I'm
 not


sure
 if
 he
 really
 needs
 an
 introduction


as
 the
 CEO
 of
 NBIM
 and
 host
 of
 the
 In


Good
 Company
 podcast.
 What
 you
 might
 not


know
 about
 uh
 Nikolai
 is
 that
 he's
 also


a
 serious
 foodie.
 So
 every
 summer
 he
 has


some
 kind
 of
 uh
 project
 like
 research
 uh


on
 barbecue
 sauces
 or
 pizza
 toppings
 and


stuff
 like
 that.
 So
 I
 really
 look


forward
 to
 the
 barbecue
 afterwards,


Nikolai.
 Absolutely.


We
 have
 we
 have
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 into


the
 barbecue
 today
 and
 I
 so
 stay
 tuned.


Great.
 Okay.
 So
 in
 this
 first
 part
 um


we're
 going
 to
 look
 at
 this
 more
 from
 an


organizational
 level
 and
 uh
 let's
 start


close
 to
 home
 with
 a
 question
 to
 you


Brigittita.
 So
 you've
 been
 leading
 our


AI
 adoption
 efforts
 uh
 but
 from
 where


you
 sit
 so
 overseeing
 both
 technology


and
 operations.
 What
 has
 been
 your


approach
 to
 introducing
 a
 tools
 and


capability
 to
 our
 organization?
 And
 also


maybe
 you
 can
 touch
 upon
 what
 you
 think


has
 worked
 well.
 Uh
 what
 surprised
 you


and
 if
 you've
 kind
 encountered
 any


resistance
 or
 any
 challenges.


Um
 I
 generally
 I
 would
 just
 say
 that
 uh


in
 MBIM
 we
 have
 this
 like
 very
 powerful


grassroot
 movement
 when
 it
 comes
 to


adopting
 new
 technology.
 So
 we
 always


have
 had
 people
 that
 are
 running
 uh


towards
 new
 opportunities.
 But
 uh
 when


AI
 came
 uh
 we
 kind
 of
 understood
 that


this
 is
 particularly
 powerful.
 This
 is


going
 to
 really
 make
 a
 big
 big
 change.


So
 we
 decided
 that
 we
 probably
 need
 to


do
 it
 a
 bit
 differently
 this
 time.
 So
 uh


uh
 we
 uh
 introduced
 more
 like
 a


comprehensive
 top-down
 approach
 uh
 when


we
 we
 started
 to
 to
 look
 at
 this
 and


we've
 done
 many
 things.
 So
 the
 first


thing
 we
 did
 was
 to
 establish
 an
 AI
 team


and
 we
 really
 thought
 that
 it
 would
 be


good
 to
 have
 a
 center
 excellence
 uh
 in


the
 organization
 and
 a
 place
 that
 could


explore
 all
 the
 new
 models
 that
 are


coming
 in
 uh
 and
 they
 change
 all
 the


time.
 uh
 we
 also
 wanted
 to
 make
 sure


they
 had
 a
 good
 platform


uh
 so
 that
 we
 could
 oversee
 all
 these


things
 in
 a
 good
 way
 uh
 and
 and
 people


come
 to
 them
 and
 and
 ask
 questions
 and


they
 are
 the
 ones
 that
 are
 you
 know


driving
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 initiatives
 uh


forward.
 Um
 secondly
 we
 decide
 that
 we


need
 some
 mandatory
 courses.
 So
 we've


made
 internal
 uh
 seven
 module
 courses


that
 everybody
 had
 to
 participate
 on
 uh


and
 uh
 we
 believe
 that
 that
 has
 been


very
 powerful
 for
 the
 organization
 and


we
 know
 that
 everybody
 at
 least
 is
 at
 at


some
 sort
 of
 level
 minimum
 level.
 Um
 we


also
 uh
 thought
 that
 we
 need
 more
 people


in
 the
 organization
 that
 can
 help
 you


know
 drive
 this
 as
 a
 big
 force.
 So
 we


introduced
 an
 AI
 ambassador
 force
 of


people
 uh
 and
 they
 received
 more


training
 than
 the
 others.
 So
 they
 are


like
 uh
 inhouse
 consultants,
 smaller


consultants
 that
 can
 help
 out
 in
 the


various
 teams
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 have


enough
 people
 to
 support.


Uh
 we
 set
 some
 uh
 bold
 statements
 on
 on


where
 what
 we
 want
 to
 achieve.
 So


currently
 our
 our
 um
 achievement
 should


be
 uh
 20%
 more
 efficiency
 uh
 and
 I
 think


everybody
 knows
 that
 in
 the
 organization


and
 they
 link
 their
 own
 performance
 to


this
 goal.
 So
 everybody
 has
 to
 do


something.
 Um
 we
 uh
 make
 sure
 that
 we


talk
 to
 uh
 external
 vendors
 a
 lot
 like


uh
 open
 AAI
 and
 anthropic.


uh
 we
 have
 brought
 in
 external
 expertise


like
 Alexander
 here
 he
 has
 helped
 us
 a


lot
 uh
 so
 uh
 all
 in
 all
 I
 mean
 we
 have


tried
 to
 just
 make
 sure
 that
 this
 is


available
 for
 for
 everyone
 and
 one
 of


those
 things
 that's
 also
 super
 important


is
 that
 we
 make
 tools
 available
 easy


availability
 to
 the
 people
 and
 for
 us
 we


have
 called
 it
 the
 three
 C's
 which
 is
 a


claude
 uh
 prompting
 uh
 engine
 that


anyone
 can
 use
 without
 any
 kind
 of
 uh


programming
 or
 um
 that
 kind
 of
 skills


from
 before.
 Uh
 and
 then
 we
 use
 cursor


for
 those
 that
 are
 more
 indepth


developers
 that
 need
 more
 more
 tools
 uh


more
 extravant
 tools
 and
 then
 of
 course


uh
 Microsoft
 core
 pilot.
 So
 these
 are


threec's
 and
 we
 really
 push
 people
 to


use
 it
 all
 the
 time
 and
 we
 talk
 about
 it


like
 all
 the
 time
 and
 I
 mean
 like
 all


the
 time.
 I
 mean
 we
 are
 talking
 all
 the


time
 all
 the
 time.
 I
 think
 it's
 pretty


cool
 actually
 that
 it's
 not
 just
 the


developers
 that
 use
 tools
 like
 cursor


but
 actually
 people
 across
 the


organization.
 Yeah.
 Non-developers
 as


well.
 Absolutely.
 So
 we're
 bringing
 down


the
 hurdles
 and
 it's
 about
 democratizing


technology
 in
 general.
 So
 this
 is
 not


like
 this
 is
 not
 dangerous
 at
 all.
 This


is
 just
 like
 very
 much
 fun
 to
 be
 honest.


Then
 would
 you
 talk
 about
 challenges?
 Um


you
 can
 think
 about
 that
 a
 bit.
 We
 get


them
 get
 back
 to
 you.
 So
 uh
 so
 Robert
 uh


through
 your
 work
 at
 Capgeemini
 you
 meet


with
 organizations
 across
 all
 industries


across
 Europe.
 Uh
 how
 does
 what
 just


described
 about
 AI
 adoption
 alignment?


What
 do
 you
 see?
 Well,
 it's
 a
 bit
 worse


than
 that
 because
 we're
 global.
 So
 not


only
 Europe
 even.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 most


of
 our
 clients
 are
 also
 on
 your
 list
 of


investments.
 So
 um
 but
 but
 yeah.
 No.
 So


I
 I
 empathize
 with
 what
 we're
 talking


English.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 empathize


with
 you
 on
 top
 down
 and
 knowledge
 and


enablement.
 So
 that's
 very
 good.
 But
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 the
 big
 organizations


that
 we
 that
 we
 serve
 that
 are
 really


successful,
 uh
 this
 top
 down
 is
 of


course
 important.
 You
 need
 a
 top


management
 that
 is
 really
 engaged
 that


is
 really
 using
 it.
 You
 also
 need
 the


top
 management
 that
 is
 not
 naive.
 I
 mean


but
 because
 this
 is
 risky
 business.
 I


mean
 the
 one
 and
 2%
 improvements
 they


are
 easily
 to
 reach
 with
 AI.
 uh
 but
 but


the
 10
 20
 30%
 also
 increases
 the
 risk


profile
 that
 you're
 running
 and
 not
 all


sectors
 in
 the
 world
 actually
 tackle


that.
 I
 mean
 we
 have
 companies
 making


airplanes.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 sit
 in
 an


airplane
 that
 is
 built
 with
 20%
 more


efficiency
 based
 on
 AI
 at
 the
 moment.
 I


just
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 that.
 Uh
 I
 mean


you
 want
 to
 have
 two
 wings
 that
 are


similar.
 And
 um
 the
 the
 thing
 is
 that


that
 there
 is
 a
 risk
 profile
 on
 it.
 And


when
 we
 look
 at
 it,
 I
 mean
 like
 uh
 like


you
 said
 in
 the
 introduction,
 I've
 been


working
 with
 AI
 really
 from
 before
 the


internet.
 I
 started
 in
 88
 with
 cognitive


psychology
 and
 artificial
 intelligence.


And
 I've
 been
 always
 trying
 to
 sell
 this


to
 people
 like
 you.
 And
 then
 the
 answer


was
 like,
 oh,
 this
 is
 science
 fiction.


Come
 back
 next
 year.
 And
 now
 it
 is
 the


other
 way
 around.
 And
 the
 the


interesting
 thing
 is
 really
 that
 um
 it


is
 a
 a
 very
 cool
 and
 interesting


technology
 but
 we
 found
 out
 that
 there's


two
 things
 that
 are
 really
 working
 well


and
 there's
 at
 the
 moment
 I
 mean
 if
 you


look
 at
 all
 this
 after
 chat
 GPT
 stuff


that
 comes
 on
 the
 market
 there's
 two


things
 that
 really
 work
 well
 and
 and


they
 really
 work
 well
 and
 that
 is


multimodality.
 I've
 never
 seen


multimodality
 working
 in
 my
 life
 so
 good


as
 it
 does
 now.
 So,
 pictures,
 text,


numbers,
 sound,
 combine
 it,
 throw
 it


together.
 We've
 tried
 it
 for
 decades.
 We


never
 managed.
 It's
 It's
 working
 well


now.
 I'm
 impressed.
 Analysts,
 reports,


graphs,
 put
 them
 together
 with
 the
 text,


make
 some
 sense
 out
 of
 it.
 It's
 good.


Multilinguality.
 I
 mean,
 I've
 never
 had


a
 system
 that
 could
 tackle
 my
 my


language
 because
 I
 speak
 four
 languages


every
 day.
 I
 have
 a
 German
 wife.
 I
 live


in
 Norway.
 I'm
 originally
 Dutch.
 My


children
 speak
 Tik
 Tok
 English.
 I
 mean,


you
 got
 all
 these
 languages
 blended
 and


and
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 English
 um
 Indian


colleagues.
 So,
 I
 got
 all
 these


influences
 from
 other
 cultures
 and
 these


these
 models
 still
 understand
 me.
 So,


now
 you
 can
 talk
 with
 your
 car.
 That's


also
 something
 that
 is
 extremely
 well
 at


the
 moment.
 We
 use
 it
 for
 little
 too


little.
 We
 could
 get
 much
 more
 out
 of


this
 because
 this
 is
 low
 risk.
 This
 is


working.
 The
 two
 things
 that
 don't
 work


well
 that
 are
 underperforming
 no
 matter


what
 some
 Alman
 or
 Elen
 are
 saying
 is


really
 abstraction
 and
 logical
 reasoning


it's
 not
 there
 there
 is
 no
 evidence


that's
 in
 these
 models
 show
 me
 the


contrary
 and
 the
 other
 thing
 is
 really


context
 and
 contextual
 awareness
 I
 mean


as
 long
 as
 I
 worked
 with
 AI
 as
 soon
 as


you
 train
 the
 model
 and
 you
 got
 models


read
 as
 soon
 as
 you
 put
 them
 in
 the
 real


world
 in
 a
 real
 world
 context
 where
 we


people
 are
 also
 living
 and
 there
 is
 some


physical
 things
 and
 effects
 these
 models


are
 not
 maintaining
 world
 models
 that


let
 them
 actually
 work
 well
 enough.
 So,


how
 long
 is
 it
 that
 Elen
 was
 promised


self-driving
 cars?
 I
 think
 the
 first


citation
 was
 2015.


I've
 stopped
 talking
 about
 Elon
 Musk.


No,
 no,
 no.
 I
 know.
 No,
 but
 I
 mean
 I


just
 I
 I
 got
 I
 got
 into
 so
 much
 trouble.


My
 my
 to
 my
 defense,
 my
 PhD
 I
 did
 with


with
 Mercedes-Benz.
 So,
 I
 I
 worked
 with


Mercedes-Benz
 on
 AI
 in
 the
 end
 of
 the


90s
 and
 we
 made
 intelligent
 brake


assistant
 systems
 and
 so
 on.
 One
 of
 the


things
 that
 we
 saw
 now
 the
 the
 cars
 that


are
 now
 licensed
 for
 SIE
 level
 three


self-driving
 in
 Texas
 and
 California,


it's
 it's
 not
 an
 American
 car.
 It's


Mercedes-Benz.
 And
 why?
 Because
 they


just
 didn't
 do
 the
 thing
 uh
 that
 that


others
 did
 like
 scaling
 and
 more
 data
 is


the
 thing.
 No,
 they
 said
 we
 need
 better


data.
 We
 need
 world
 models.
 We
 need
 more


dimensions.
 Not
 only
 a
 camera
 with
 a
 lot


of
 data.
 No,
 we
 need
 more
 dimensions.


So,
 Mercedes
 implemented
 it
 well.
 They


were
 laughed
 at
 because
 they
 just


collected
 data
 in
 the
 stood
 cut
 area.


They
 didn't
 need
 more
 data
 they
 say
 and


then
 they
 actually
 built
 world
 models


and
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff
 in
 this
 and


multisspectral
 images
 and
 LAR
 and
 all


that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 And
 they
 got
 SA3


self-driving
 certified.
 So
 this
 is
 this


is
 also
 about
 using
 the
 data
 you
 have


smartly
 and
 maybe
 you
 don't
 need
 scaling


and
 you
 don't
 need
 all
 the
 data
 of
 the


world.
 So
 these
 are
 interesting
 things.


Maybe
 I
 should
 just
 No,
 I
 just
 have


wanted
 to
 bring
 Alexandros
 into
 this.
 So


from
 your
 perspective
 working
 directly


with
 organizations
 Alexander,
 so
 you're


focusing
 on
 these
 practical
 AI
 solutions


just
 getting
 things
 to
 work.
 So
 what's


your
 take
 on
 this?
 Uh
 what
 are
 you


seeing
 as
 the
 key
 factors
 that
 uh
 you


know
 determines
 whether
 air
 adoption


actually
 delivers
 results
 and
 not
 just


like
 expensive
 pilot
 projects?
 Yeah,


it's
 a
 good
 question.
 I
 think
 uh
 first


and
 foremost,
 I
 think
 doing
 something
 is


better
 than
 having
 this
 wait
 and
 see


mentality.
 Unfortunately,
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 still
 have
 this
 sitting
 on
 the


fence
 mentality.
 And
 I
 I'm
 I'm
 worried


that
 we
 get
 derailed
 from
 definitions


and
 discussions
 about
 uh
 well,
 it's
 not


yet


performing
 reasoning
 to
 the
 level
 that


we
 want.
 I
 mean,
 a
 year
 ago,
 we
 were


comparably
 at
 the
 stone
 ages
 when
 we


look
 at
 the
 model
 performances.
 So,


forget
 about
 it.
 You
 don't
 need
 a
 PhD
 in


uh
 neural
 networks
 to
 use
 AI
 today.


That's
 the
 key
 difference
 compared
 to


last
 year.
 Now
 anyone
 can
 use
 AI.
 So
 who


succeeds?
 I
 think
 it
 starts
 with
 solving


real
 business
 problems.
 It's
 not
 just


saying
 let's
 do
 AI.
 It
 needs
 to
 be


strategic.
 Doesn't
 help
 that
 the
 CEO


goes
 to
 the
 IT
 director
 and
 say
 what
 are


we
 doing
 about
 a
 AI?
 And
 the
 IT
 director


says
 uh
 well
 uh
 we've
 turned
 on


co-pilot.
 Tick
 the
 box.
 No.
 Solving


Monday
 morning
 problems.
 That's
 what
 the


real
 value
 is
 about,
 right?
 So
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 pilots
 that
 fail,
 they
 fail


because
 they
 try
 to
 achieve
 too
 much.
 So


So
 honestly,
 I
 think
 it's
 simple.
 Try
 to


ship
 fast,
 do
 good
 enough
 solutions,
 get


real
 feedback
 from
 users,
 and
 then


iterate
 from
 there.
 I
 think
 that's
 where


you
 get
 successful
 pilots
 that
 turn
 into


production.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 Nikolai,
 so
 in


your
 role,
 you
 you
 meet
 with
 business


leaders
 from
 across
 the
 world,
 what
 what


is
 your
 uh
 what
 do
 you
 think
 are
 the


most
 important
 factors
 for
 uh
 adoption


of
 AI?
 No,
 you
 need
 to
 have
 a
 a
 total


maniac
 at
 the
 top
 and
 you
 need
 to
 I'm


I'm
 serious.
 This
 is
 just
 the
 biggest


thing
 that
 we
 will
 ever
 experience
 as


human
 beings.
 It's
 unbelievable
 what's


going
 on
 now
 because
 I
 have
 there
 has


never
 been
 a
 time
 in
 the
 world
 where
 one


company
 who
 deploy
 this
 properly
 gain
 a


20%
 advantage
 on
 the
 other
 company
 in


one
 year
 and
 another
 20
 and
 another
 20


and
 you
 know
 when
 you
 have
 like
 gained


50
 to
 100%
 advantage
 on
 your
 competition


they
 will
 never
 catch
 up.


You
 win
 they
 die.
 You
 know
 these


companies
 are
 out
 of
 business.
 And
 it


can
 happen
 on
 in
 a
 threeyear
 time
 span


now.
 So
 you
 can't
 wait
 for
 anything.
 You


need
 to
 be
 maniacs
 at
 the
 top.
 You
 need


to
 totally
 implement
 uh
 across


everything
 you
 do.
 You
 need
 to
 have


ambassadors
 just
 infiltrating
 your


company
 and
 you
 need
 to
 have
 events


non-stop
 and
 mandatory
 to
 get
 everybody


going.
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 this
 is
 like


deadly
 serious,
 you
 know.


Yeah.
 I
 think
 it
 helps
 with
 the
 maniac


on
 top.


Oh
 man.


I
 just,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 I
 I
 mean,
 I
 I


hardly
 sleep
 these
 days
 because
 I'm
 just


so
 uh
 totally
 super
 keen
 that
 we
 just
 uh


uh
 get
 uh
 in
 front
 of
 everybody
 else.


And
 you
 need
 to
 just
 That's
 the


mentality
 you
 need
 to
 have.
 You
 know,
 I


was
 in
 I
 was
 in
 California
 uh
 last
 uh


the
 week
 before
 last
 and
 you
 know,
 I
 had


a
 had
 an
 hour
 with
 Bill
 Gates
 and
 he
 had


just
 spent
 the
 whole
 week
 talking
 to


everybody
 who
 counts,
 right?
 Hasabis


Oldman,
 you
 know,
 all
 the
 guys.
 And
 he


was
 just
 like,
 it's
 just
 like
 totally


mind-boggling.
 I've
 been
 working
 on
 this


for
 my
 whole
 life.
 I've
 never
 seen


anything
 like
 it.
 And
 the
 speed
 is
 just


like
 the
 speed
 is
 just
 accelerating,


you
 know,
 and
 stuff
 we
 are
 doing
 now
 in


the
 fund.
 We
 we
 couldn't
 have
 done
 it
 3


months
 ago,
 you
 know.
 We
 are
 like,
 you


know,
 we
 own
 9,000
 companies.
 We
 monitor


them
 real
 time
 in
 terms
 of
 headline


risks
 and
 so
 on
 across
 the
 world.
 We


monitor
 them
 live
 in
 16
 different


languages
 and
 we
 get
 notification
 if
 we


get
 any
 headline
 on
 any
 company


anywhere.
 In
 the
 past
 it
 took
 us
 you


know
 days
 now
 it's
 like
 minutes
 real


time
 monitoring
 of
 the
 whole
 world.
 I


mean
 hello


um
 you
 know
 the
 way
 we
 can
 deploy


capital
 much
 quicker
 the
 way
 we
 can
 look


at
 uh
 uh
 kind
 of
 wage
 packages
 and


proposals.


I
 mean
 it's
 just
 incredible.
 Why
 is
 why


not
 everybody
 doing
 this?
 Well,
 I
 hope


they
 are,
 but
 you
 know,
 in
 a
 way
 also
 at


the
 same
 time,
 I
 hope
 they
 aren't


because
 uh


because
 uh
 the
 advantages
 for
 the
 people


who
 really
 take
 these
 on
 board
 is
 just


immense.


All right.
 So,
 if
 we
 shift
 in
 our
 focus


from
 organization
 to
 to
 the
 individual


level
 and
 I'm
 sure
 many
 in
 the
 audience


are
 wondering
 about
 how
 AI
 will
 shape


their
 professional
 future.
 So,
 um
 coming


back
 to
 you
 again
 and
 bringing
 it
 back


home.
 So
 as
 someone
 who
 manages
 them


both
 technology
 and
 operations,
 how
 is


AI
 changing
 the
 skill
 set
 and


capabilities
 that
 you
 need
 in
 your


teams?


I
 think
 I
 would
 start
 by
 saying
 the


ability
 to
 change
 and
 adopt
 to
 something


new.
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 most
 important


thing
 as
 Nicholas
 says
 and
 you
 can


imagine
 how
 it
 was
 to
 have
 him
 back
 from


that
 California
 trip
 when
 he
 came
 back


to
 the
 office.
 uh
 but
 the
 ability
 to


change
 and
 also
 uh
 um
 understand
 that


you
 might
 have
 worked
 on
 something


yesterday
 that
 you
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 effort


into
 and
 then
 today
 might
 not
 have
 that


much
 value.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 one
 of
 the


most
 important
 thing
 but
 of
 course
 I


mean
 to
 to
 have
 an
 education
 with
 some


technology
 content
 is
 beneficial


absolutely
 at
 least
 for
 us
 in
 this
 fund.


So
 I
 think
 that
 those
 are
 the
 two
 most


important
 things.
 So
 asking
 for
 a
 friend


then
 will
 you
 need
 more
 developers
 going


forward
 or
 less?


I
 think
 that
 we
 will
 need
 developers.
 Uh


of
 course
 absolutely
 I
 think
 that
 we


need
 uh
 uh
 developers.
 We
 need
 data


scientists.
 We
 need
 uh
 also
 in
 people


that
 are
 good
 in
 investments.
 I
 mean


it's
 just
 like
 the
 collaboration
 between


the
 various
 skill
 sets
 that's
 important


for
 the
 future.
 But
 again
 you
 have
 to
 be


willing
 to
 change.
 You
 always
 have
 to
 be


willing
 to
 embrace
 what's
 new
 and
 what's


coming
 and
 that
 it
 might
 or
 will


definitely
 impact
 your
 daily
 work.


Alexander,
 you
 have
 uh
 said
 that
 AI
 will


amplify
 our
 performance
 or
 of
 potential


by
 10
 to
 maybe
 even
 100
 times.


How
 should
 we
 prepare
 uh
 us
 here?
 Uh
 how


should
 we
 prepare
 for
 being
 relevant
 in


two
 three
 years
 from
 now?
 Yeah,
 I
 think


I
 I
 I
 would
 agree
 with
 Big
 Git
 there.


This
 is
 to
 me
 very
 exciting
 because
 it's


it's
 about
 enabling
 and
 empowering


people
 that


could
 not
 develop
 or
 solve
 their
 own


problems
 before
 and
 now
 anyone
 can
 solve


their
 own
 problems,
 right?
 But
 that


doesn't
 mean
 that
 we
 don't
 need


developers.
 So
 I
 think
 like
 the


opportunity
 space
 is
 just
 growing


dramatically
 which
 means
 that
 we
 could


keep
 the
 same
 number
 of
 developers
 or
 we


could
 double
 and
 solve
 a
 thousand
 times


more
 problems
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 But
 I


think
 it's
 really
 naive
 and
 I
 know
 this


room
 is
 probably
 divided.
 There
 are


those
 that
 hate
 AI
 assisted
 coding
 and


think
 it's
 just
 the
 worst
 thing
 that


have
 ever
 happened
 and
 then
 others
 have


jumped
 on.
 But
 I
 think
 it's
 naive
 to


think
 that
 our
 job
 as
 developers
 will
 be


the
 same
 a
 few
 years
 from
 now.
 I
 I
 think


that's
 that's
 just
 stupid
 to
 be honest


with
 you.
 But
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 those


that
 embrace
 it
 will
 have
 the
 potential


to
 be
 10x
 or
 even
 100x
 versions
 of


themselves.
 And
 I
 think
 we'll
 see
 that


smaller
 teams
 will
 be
 able
 to
 compete


with
 large
 teams
 that
 are
 stuck
 in


legacy
 ways
 of
 working.
 And
 I
 think


yeah,
 the
 future
 10x
 version
 of
 a


developer
 are
 those
 that
 embrace
 AI
 and


become
 AI
 prolific,
 that
 collaborate


with
 AI
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 maybe
 they're
 a


part
 engineer,
 a
 part
 product
 thinker,


and
 a
 part
 AI
 whisperer.
 I
 think
 that's


the
 that's
 the
 future
 uh
 super


developers.


How
 about
 data?
 Well,
 I
 think
 data
 was


important
 before
 we
 got
 the
 level
 of
 AI


we
 have
 today,
 but
 now
 it's
 become
 even


uh
 more
 important.
 But
 I
 think,
 you


know,
 this
 is
 something
 that
 scared
 a


lot
 of
 people
 10
 years
 ago
 when
 we


started
 talking
 about
 digitalization.
 Uh


and
 it
 was
 almost
 like
 an
 excuse,
 right?


Oh,
 no,
 but
 we
 can't
 change
 our
 ways
 of


working
 because
 that
 I
 don't
 trust
 the


data.
 But
 now
 with
 AI
 and
 the
 level
 of


AI
 we
 have
 today,
 I
 think
 the
 visibility


and
 sort
 of
 um
 accountability
 becomes


very
 clear,
 right?
 So
 now
 we're
 starting


to
 make
 decisions
 assisted
 by
 AI.
 It


just
 amplifies
 the
 requirement
 for
 data


quality.
 I
 think
 that's
 where
 you
 guys


have
 done
 really
 a
 good
 job
 on
 focusing


on
 data
 quality
 and
 then
 empowering
 the


organization
 right
 letting
 it
 loose.
 You


will
 break
 some
 glasses
 but
 in


controlled
 manners
 and
 then
 uh
 you
 will


uh
 spur
 a
 number
 of
 solutions
 that
 I


don't
 think
 we
 would
 have
 been
 able
 to


before
 in
 just
 having
 developers
 and
 IT


departments
 working
 on
 this.
 Now
 the


whole
 organization
 is
 working
 on
 it.
 I


think
 that's
 the
 key
 difference.
 Robert,


um
 uh
 so
 so
 why
 is
 data
 engineering
 so


much
 more
 important
 now
 with
 AI?
 Uh
 we


keep
 hearing
 that
 right
 that
 data


quality
 and
 data
 engineering
 becomes


more
 so
 data
 engineering
 has
 always
 been


important.
 I
 mean
 before
 CH
 GPT
 you


built
 data
 models
 on
 your
 own
 data
 and


you
 put
 them
 in
 production.
 Now
 we
 get


global
 foundation
 models
 that
 are
 built


on
 basically
 all
 data
 that's
 available


on
 the
 world
 on
 the
 worldwide
 web.
 So


there's
 no
 competitive
 advantage
 in


using
 that
 if
 you
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 use


these
 foundational
 models
 well
 and
 not


inject
 your
 own
 data
 into
 it.
 So
 to
 your


point
 I
 mean
 data
 engineering
 will
 be


extremely
 important.
 It's
 your
 only


competitive
 advantage
 because
 everybody


can
 do
 1000
 and
 thousand
 ticks
 with
 the


same
 foundational
 models
 with
 the
 same


strategies
 and
 know
 how
 to
 prompt.
 So


you
 need
 to
 add
 that
 extra.
 So
 I
 and
 you


see
 that
 so
 India
 is
 actually
 trying
 to


build
 models
 they
 have
 22
 official


languages
 and
 they're
 building
 models


for
 most
 of
 them
 so
 that
 they
 can
 enable


all
 their
 smart
 people
 in
 all
 these


regions
 in
 their
 own
 languages.
 I
 was
 on


the
 motorcycle
 tour
 in
 Africa
 bedwin


languages
 they
 are
 known
 to
 foundational


models
 but
 you
 can't
 translate
 them
 with


them
 because
 they're
 not
 modeled
 into


them.
 So
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 things


missing
 in
 these
 foundational
 models.


Other
 things
 are
 available
 to
 everybody.


So
 having
 your
 own
 data
 available,
 being


able
 to
 inject
 that,
 build
 your
 own


models
 in
 your
 own
 infrastruct


structures
 with
 it,
 that
 is
 definitely
 a


thing
 that
 we
 see
 changing
 a
 lot
 and


very
 fast
 at
 the
 moment
 and
 like
 we've


said
 several
 times.
 So
 at
 the
 moment


there
 is
 new
 things
 coming
 up
 all
 the


time
 and
 we
 went
 from
 chat
 GPT
 to
 rack


to
 graph
 rack
 to
 whatever.
 Now
 we're


talking
 about
 the
 gentic
 AI
 uh
 whatever


that
 might
 mean.
 Uh
 but
 I
 mean
 we
 have


had
 all
 this
 kind
 of
 agents
 have
 been


there
 for
 many
 years.
 We've
 been
 them
 in


building
 them
 into
 the
 cars
 for
 20
 years


ago
 already
 with
 and
 without
 AI.
 Now
 we


see
 an
 enablement
 with
 this
 these
 large


language
 models
 and
 foundational
 models


that
 make
 them
 extremely
 powerful.
 uh
 if


you
 want
 to
 make
 them
 powerful,


autonomous
 with
 authority
 and
 agency
 uh


had
 large
 action
 models
 and
 so
 on.
 We


will
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 changes
 and
 you
 cannot


only
 break
 small
 things
 like
 you
 said
 in


a
 controlled
 fashion
 but
 you
 can
 also


break
 large
 thing
 in
 a
 non-controlled


fashion
 and
 we
 need
 to
 find
 out
 how
 to


deal
 with
 that
 because
 this
 is
 a


different
 way
 of
 thinking
 a
 different


way
 of
 working
 and
 we
 have
 not
 really


fully
 understood
 it
 not
 at
 scale
 and


that
 is
 definitely
 an
 issue
 that
 I
 see


more
 and
 more.
 All
 right,
 Nicolola,
 I


have
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 tough
 question
 for
 you


also
 on
 this.
 So,
 bring
 it
 on.
 Yeah.
 So,


this
 is
 the
 elephant
 in
 the
 room.
 Will


people
 lose
 their
 jobs
 to
 AI?
 Well,
 for


sure
 the
 people
 who
 don't
 use
 AI
 will


lose
 their
 jobs.
 I
 hope
 so.
 I
 mean,
 here


at
 MBM,
 if
 you
 don't
 use
 uh
 AI,
 you'll


be
 you
 will
 never
 be
 promoted,
 right?
 Uh


because
 you
 will
 you
 will
 lag
 so
 much


behind
 everybody
 else.
 So,
 um
 so
 will


you
 lose
 your
 jobs?
 Um


well
 um


for
 sure
 not
 in
 the
 short
 term
 I
 think


it's
 all
 about
 uh
 you
 know
 making
 the


efficiency
 uh
 better
 and
 so
 on
 but
 you


know
 in
 the
 longer
 term
 there
 are
 some


uh
 type
 of
 jobs
 that
 will
 be
 um


challenged
 right
 uh
 lawyers
 accountants


uh
 engineers
 all
 these
 kind
 of
 things


and
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 when
 you
 look


at
 the
 time
 we
 are
 at
 now
 you'll
 have
 uh


many
 type
 of
 jobs
 which
 will
 be


challenged


in
 the
 white
 color
 space,
 but
 at
 the


same
 time,
 you
 know,
 with
 the
 humanoids


and
 so
 on
 coming
 in
 in
 the
 tens
 of


thousands
 and
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 next


year
 and
 the
 year
 beyond,
 you
 know,


we'll
 have
 we
 have
 challenges
 on
 the


white
 on
 the
 blue
 collar
 side,
 too.
 So,


we
 are
 um
 at
 an
 incredibly
 interesting


time.
 Do
 you
 think
 we'll
 see
 like
 here


in
 MBM,
 do
 you
 think
 we'll
 see
 like


fully
 autonomous
 digital
 portfolio


managers
 anytime
 soon?
 No,
 we
 are
 very


So,
 we
 we
 never
 have
 anything
 that
 goes


straight
 from
 AI
 to
 execution
 or
 trade,


right?
 there's
 always
 a
 human
 uh
 in


between
 and
 so
 all
 the
 investment


decisions
 here
 are
 being
 taken
 are
 being


taken
 by
 us.
 Just
 one
 thing
 on
 a
 we
 did


um
 a
 podcast
 with
 uh
 Ethan
 Molik
 the


Wharton
 professor
 who
 is
 uh
 very
 strong


on
 the
 implementation
 of
 AI
 in
 your


daily
 life.
 Uh
 so
 we
 did
 a
 podcast
 with


him
 which
 is
 coming
 out
 tomorrow
 and


he's
 showing
 some
 live
 cases
 of
 agentic


AI
 use
 which
 is
 pretty
 cool.
 Yeah.
 So


tune
 in
 tomorrow.
 Yep.
 8:00.


Nice
 trailer.


Well,


just
 also
 a
 question
 to
 the
 panel
 about


AI
 maybe
 adoption.
 Do
 you
 see,
 you
 know,


generational
 differences
 in
 how
 people


are
 adopting
 tools?
 Is
 it,
 you
 know,


just
 the
 younger
 people
 who
 are
 doing


this
 or
 is
 it
 throughout
 their
 careers?


What's
 what
 do
 you
 panel
 think?
 So,


Alexander
 maybe
 start.
 Well,
 I
 think
 age


has
 uh
 obviously
 plays
 a
 big
 role.
 I


think
 there
 have
 been
 uh
 some
 surveys


and
 statistics
 about
 this
 as
 well.
 I


think
 it's
 maybe
 more
 about
 how
 they
 use


it,
 right?
 So
 I
 think
 uh
 Gen
 C
 more
 than


50%
 are
 using
 it
 as
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 life


partner
 for
 any
 decision
 and
 it's
 almost


like
 they're
 not
 making
 any
 decisions


without
 first
 uh
 uh
 conferring
 with
 chat


GPT
 and
 I
 think
 maybe
 the
 uh
 the


millennials
 and
 or
 baby
 boomers
 maybe


are
 more
 in
 the
 category
 of
 uh
 impro


starting
 out
 with
 improving
 the
 speech


for
 their
 uh
 their
 confirmation
 party
 or


something
 like
 that.
 So
 yeah,
 I
 think


it's
 uh
 it
 has
 uh
 it
 has
 a
 little
 bit
 to


do
 with
 age
 and
 uh
 and
 how
 prone
 you
 are


to
 to
 changing
 your
 ways
 of
 working.
 But


I
 think
 we
 need
 to
 share
 and
 we
 need
 to


show
 each
 other
 the
 opportunities
 with


AI.
 But
 it's
 really
 cool
 what's


happened.
 If
 you
 if
 if
 you
 just
 think


about
 the
 last
 10
 years,
 10
 years
 ago,


who
 were
 the
 heroes
 in
 the
 workplace?


The
 old
 farts
 like
 me,
 right?
 The
 the


old
 people.
 They
 were
 they
 were
 really


the
 leading
 stars.
 Then
 five
 years
 ago,


who
 were
 the
 leading
 stars?
 Well,
 they


were
 the
 young
 people,
 right?
 Who
 could


code
 because
 you
 needed
 if
 you
 could


code
 Python,
 you
 were
 like
 a
 hero.
 So


then
 all
 the
 other
 people,
 all
 the
 old


people
 felt
 like
 losers
 and
 the
 young


people,
 they
 felt
 like
 heroes.
 Then


Chhatt
 comes
 along.
 Then
 suddenly
 it's


changing
 again.
 No,
 the
 old
 people
 like


me,
 we
 can
 code,
 right?
 We
 don't
 need
 we


don't
 need
 these
 people
 anymore.
 And
 so


it's
 like
 it's
 upside
 down
 the
 whole


thing.
 So
 basically
 age
 has
 been


neutralized
 which
 is
 really
 cool.
 It


means
 another
 thing
 being
 mid
 mid-level


managers.


In
 the
 old
 days
 it
 meant
 that
 you
 took


whatever
 the
 guys
 at
 the
 top
 said
 and


you
 transmitted
 it
 down
 through
 the


organization.
 Right


now
 you
 also
 function
 as
 a
 root
 system.


You
 suck
 up
 the
 technology
 from
 uh
 you


know
 from
 elsewhere
 in
 the
 organization


and
 you
 transmit
 it
 to
 the
 top.
 So
 being


a
 mid-level
 manager
 has
 totally
 changed


over
 the
 last
 three
 years.
 I
 would
 say


your
 function
 has
 totally
 changed.
 It's


really
 fascinating.
 I
 mean
 we
 are
 living


through
 some
 total
 revolutions
 now
 in


corporate
 life.
 I
 mean
 it's
 so
 much
 fun.


No.
 Yeah.
 What
 it
 means
 is
 that
 there
 is


so
 it's
 so
 much
 more
 fun
 to
 work
 these


days
 compared
 to
 in
 the
 past.
 Most


people
 who
 leave
 a
 company
 they
 leave


because
 they
 don't
 have
 challenges.
 They


don't
 feel
 they
 learn.
 They
 don't
 feel


they're
 being
 challenged.
 Now
 you
 learn


every
 day.
 I
 I
 was
 in
 the
 London
 office


on
 uh
 uh
 when
 was
 that
 get
 there?
 Was
 it


uh
 Friday?
 Friday.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 sit
 down


with
 people.
 It's
 just
 like,
 you
 know,


Nikolai,
 it's
 so
 much
 fun
 at
 work
 now.


We
 feel
 challenged.
 We
 feel
 we
 learn,


you
 know,
 it's
 it's
 personal


development.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 cool
 stuff.


Cuz
 I
 think
 we're
 running
 out
 of
 time


here,
 but
 we
 wanted
 to
 have
 like
 a
 final


rapid,
 you
 know,
 question
 to
 all
 of
 you.


So,
 if
 you
 had
 to
 give
 the
 audience
 here


one
 key
 insight
 into
 about
 AI's
 impact


going
 forward,
 what
 would
 it
 be?
 Let's


start
 with
 you,
 Nicola.
 Ah,
 it's


changing
 your
 life.
 It's
 uh
 upside
 down.


It's
 just
 get
 in
 there
 and
 spend
 all


your
 time
 on
 it.
 And
 and
 if
 you
 don't


think
 you
 got
 time
 to
 really
 educate


yourself
 on
 AI,
 you
 are
 just
 totally
 not


getting
 it
 because
 uh
 you
 know,
 just


leave
 I
 I
 come
 into
 rooms
 now
 leave


everything
 you
 do.
 You
 know,
 it
 doesn't


matter.
 It
 is
 totally
 unimportant
 what


you're
 doing
 now.
 just
 train
 yourself


because
 you're
 going
 to
 become
 so
 much


more
 efficient
 and
 so
 much
 easier
 to
 to


learn
 and
 train
 yourself
 with
 AI
 now.


Absolutely.
 What's
 your
 answer?
 Yeah,


this
 is
 probably
 even
 more
 interesting


because
 um
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 need
 to


understand
 AI
 at
 the
 moment
 and
 you


don't
 need
 to
 learn
 it
 and
 if
 I
 see
 my


discussions
 with
 my
 clients,
 I
 haven't


been
 discussing
 technology
 for
 last
 four


or
 five
 months.
 I
 think
 what
 we're


discussing
 especially
 with
 this
 agentic


AI
 what
 we're
 discussing
 now
 is
 really


okay
 I
 can
 give
 you
 an
 unlimited
 amount


of
 employees
 so
 what
 what
 are
 you
 going


to
 do
 what
 what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 solve


what
 is
 actually
 your
 plan
 so
 now
 it's


not
 even
 an
 AI
 strategy
 it
 is
 what
 is


your
 strategy
 because
 companies
 need
 to


rethink
 their
 whole
 strategy
 now
 and


that
 that
 is
 this
 top-
 down
 thinking


that
 needs
 to
 come
 so
 what
 what
 kind
 of


advice
 can
 you
 give
 well
 at
 least
 be
 not


naive
 learn
 about
 so
 use
 it
 I
 Can
 you


learn
 by
 using
 and
 and
 see
 where
 you


strand
 and
 see
 what
 you
 find
 out?
 I
 mean


like
 you
 say
 you
 can
 do
 coding
 maybe
 you


are
 successful
 maybe
 not.
 You
 can
 you


can
 make
 analyst
 reports
 maybe
 you
 can


replace
 Nikolai
 maybe
 not.
 I
 mean
 try
 it


you
 know
 like
 I
 mean
 use
 this


technology.
 I
 mean
 there
 there
 are
 so


many
 things
 that
 you
 can
 do
 with
 it
 and


I
 speak
 a
 lot
 with
 young
 people.
 I


worked
 with
 a
 new
 new
 dag
 with
 the


project
 at
 the
 time
 and
 they
 were


discussing
 what
 it
 should
 be
 a
 library


or
 not
 and
 then
 I
 said
 no
 it
 should
 be


we
 should
 make
 a
 meeting
 place.
 So
 I
 go


there
 every
 now
 and
 meet
 like
 14
 15


years
 old
 and
 last
 time
 there
 was
 one


guy
 Natan
 from
 uh
 from
 Google
 he
 came
 up


to
 me
 and
 we
 talked
 together
 and
 he
 said


like
 I'm
 going
 to
 start
 a
 company
 and
 he


said
 I'm
 going
 to
 use
 AI
 I'm
 going
 to


start
 a
 company.
 So
 I
 said
 okay
 I
 want


to
 follow
 up.
 So
 now
 we
 have
 regular


followers
 because
 I
 want
 to
 see
 how
 he


does
 this,
 you
 know,
 like
 this
 is
 so


cool.
 People
 see
 possibilities
 where
 you


never
 seen.
 How
 about
 you,
 Alexander?


What's
 your
 I
 think
 you
 have
 a
 saying
 in


NBIM
 AI
 won't
 take
 your
 job.
 Someone


using
 AI
 will.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 spot


on
 the
 mentality.
 So
 if
 you're
 early
 in


your
 career
 now,
 that's
 that's
 the
 only


advice.
 Jump
 on
 it
 and
 learn
 to
 be


proficient
 with
 AI.
 I
 tell
 my
 kids
 all


the
 time,
 use
 your
 words.
 That's
 your


biggest
 asset.
 learn
 how
 to
 communicate


and
 collaborate
 with
 AI
 and
 then
 you'll


leaprog
 10
 years
 uh
 for
 those
 who
 don't.


So
 that
 that
 gap
 will
 just
 increase.
 But


but
 remember
 that
 the
 human
 brain
 is


still
 superior
 in
 contextual
 awareness


and
 contextuality.
 I
 mean
 AI
 is
 not.
 So


use
 that's
 what
 we
 bring
 right
 that's


what
 we
 can
 bring
 when
 we
 collaborate


with
 AI.
 We
 bring
 taste,
 we
 bring


opinion,
 we
 can
 scrutinize
 and
 we
 can
 be


the
 one
 with
 the
 critical
 thinking.
 So


you
 know
 people
 ask
 me
 all
 the
 time
 are


we
 going
 to
 become
 more
 stupid
 when
 we


uh
 just
 leave
 all
 our
 decision
 making
 to


AI
 or
 are
 we
 going
 to
 become
 less


creative.
 I
 think
 on
 the
 contrary
 with


AI
 you
 can
 expand
 and
 you
 can
 challenge


your
 thinking.
 You
 can
 look
 at
 different


perspectives
 and
 it
 just
 opens
 up
 the


opportunity
 for
 us
 to
 create
 a
 thousand


campaigns
 instead
 of
 one
 campaign
 or
 10


campaigns.
 That's
 that's
 the
 magic
 of


it.
 10x
 or
 100x.
 But
 then
 I
 just
 have
 a


question
 for
 you
 because
 Amazon
 there


was
 just
 a
 letter
 of
 six
 programmers


from
 Amazon
 and
 they
 said
 our
 job
 is
 so


boring
 at
 the
 moment
 because
 we
 get
 all


this
 AI
 delivered
 code
 and
 we're
 just


doing
 the
 code
 review
 and
 we
 are
 not
 the


kind
 of
 programmers
 that
 love
 code


review
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 many


programmers
 you
 know
 that
 love
 you
 know


most
 developers
 for
 the
 last
 10
 years


they've
 been
 going
 on
 Stack
 Overflow


sifting
 through
 comments
 and
 picking
 out


and
 copy
 pasting.
 Well,
 it's
 the
 same


thing.
 It's
 just
 a
 new
 more
 advanced
 way


of
 doing
 it
 now.
 But
 by
 doing
 that
 you


learn
 about
 coding,
 you
 learn
 about


creating
 the
 program
 and
 now
 you
 get
 the


program
 delivered
 and
 you're
 reviewing


it.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 get
 the
 experience?
 I


think
 the
 key
 difference
 AI
 to
 review.


No,
 I
 think
 the
 the
 key
 thing
 is
 we're


now
 as
 developers
 for
 those
 who
 are


developers.
 I
 think
 why
 would
 you
 want


to
 handw
 write
 all
 the
 code?
 There
 is
 no


value
 in
 handwriting
 all
 the
 code.
 If


you
 can
 spend
 your
 time
 on


orchestrating,
 on
 architecting,
 on


designing,
 that's
 where
 we
 add
 value
 as


human
 beings.
 So
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


yes,
 some
 people
 love
 to
 create
 very


beautiful
 lines
 of
 code,
 but
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day,
 we
 just
 want
 solutions
 that


work,
 right?
 This
 discussion
 will


continue
 afterwards
 but
 I
 love
 it
 was


your
 I
 just
 have
 to
 echo
 some other


people
 say
 I
 just
 embrace
 it
 share
 use


cases
 inspire
 the
 organization
 and
 just


uh
 open
 up
 because
 uh
 it's
 just
 fun
 and


exciting
 and
 full
 of
 opportunities
 and


that's
 how
 we
 have
 embraced
 it
 at least.


Yep.
 Thanks
 all
 for
 uh
 for
 those


engaging
 in
 insightful
 uh
 perspectives


on
 how
 AI
 will
 impact
 our
 jobs.
 I'm
 sure


uh
 as
 you
 said
 with
 the
 conversation


will
 continue
 uh
 throughout
 this


evening.
 Uh
 now
 we
 will
 have
 a
 10


minutes
 break
 but
 before
 that
 let's
 uh


have
 an
 applause.


Okay.
 I
 hope
 all
 of
 you
 got
 uh
 to


stretch
 your
 legs
 and
 are
 ready
 for
 the


the
 last
 part
 of
 of
 the
 of
 today.
 So


next
 up
 is
 security.
 And
 I
 guess
 you
 can


imagine
 that
 um
 NBIM
 is
 an
 attractive
 um


target
 for
 cyber
 criminals.
 Uh
 so
 that


means
 that
 we
 need
 to
 have
 full
 control


of
 the
 security
 aspect.
 And
 luckily
 we


have
 the
 best
 security
 team
 in
 the


world.
 And
 two
 of
 them
 are
 going
 to


present
 for
 you
 today.
 That's
 Selena
 and


Johanses
 who
 going
 to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit


about
 how
 we
 run
 our
 security


operations.
 Please.


What
 if
 ma
 what
 if
 the
 hours
 used
 on


manual
 cyber
 investigations
 could
 be


reclaimed


without
 sacrificing
 control
 and
 insight?


This
 is
 a
 question
 that
 we
 have
 asked
 in


EMBIB
 and
 today
 Yan
 and
 I
 are
 going
 to


show
 you
 how
 AI
 has
 helped
 us
 make
 this


vision
 a
 real
 reality.


Yes.
 And
 to
 quickly
 run
 through
 the


goals,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 just
 a
 quick


run
 through
 of
 a
 very
 cool
 AI
 use
 case


that
 we
 have
 developed
 and
 are
 using


today.
 Then
 we're
 going
 to
 dig
 a
 bit


deep
 and
 try
 and
 understand
 some
 of
 the


main
 building
 blocks
 that
 make
 this
 AI


workflow
 work
 and
 also


is
 generally
 applicable
 to
 most
 other


advanced
 AI
 workflows
 as
 well.
 And
 then


we're
 going
 to
 speculate
 a
 bit
 about
 the


future
 because
 that's
 on
 brand
 as
 well.


In
 MBIM,
 we
 have
 a
 cyber
 response
 team


that
 run
 a
 247
 security
 and
 operation


center.
 This
 means
 that
 we
 are


constantly
 monitoring,
 analyzing,
 and


responding
 to
 threats.


What
 does
 this
 mean
 in
 practice?
 Well,


you
 can
 be
 in
 deep
 deep
 deep
 REM
 sleep


when
 your
 phone
 buzzes
 with
 a
 high


priority
 alarm.
 This
 is
 a
 type
 of
 alarm


that
 can
 that
 can
 make
 it
 look
 like
 the


oil
 fund
 has
 just
 vanished.
 And
 let's


just
 say
 it
 is
 expected
 that
 we
 wake
 up


extremely
 fast.


But
 here
 is
 where
 it
 gets
 interesting


because
 as
 mentioned
 in
 in
 MBIM
 we
 are


bringing
 AI
 more
 and
 more
 into
 the
 loop


and
 in
 cyber
 response
 we
 aren't
 just


using
 AI
 to
 raise
 alarms
 but
 to


contextualize
 them.
 And
 what
 does
 that


mean?
 Well,
 let
 me
 take
 you
 through
 an


incident.


It
 is
 2:00
 a.m.
 on
 a
 Sunday


and
 you
 wake
 up
 from
 your
 phone
 buzzing.


A
 high
 priority
 alarm
 has
 just
 come
 in


to
 our
 monitoring
 platform.
 This
 is
 the


type
 of
 call
 that
 spikes
 your
 heart
 rate


to
 180
 before
 you
 can
 even
 process


what's
 going
 on,
 but
 you
 immediately


know
 that
 something
 bad
 might
 be


happening.


However,
 no
 time
 to
 waste.
 We
 get
 up,
 we


get
 dressed,
 and
 we
 are
 by
 our
 desk


within
 seconds.
 We
 log
 in,
 we
 launch
 our


monitoring
 platform,
 and
 there
 it
 is.


Malware
 detected
 on
 a
 device.


It's
 vague,
 but
 kind
 of
 heavy.
 What


malware?
 What
 device?
 Is
 it
 a
 lateral


movement?
 Is
 this
 just
 false
 alarm?


In
 that
 moment,
 everything
 is
 a


possibility
 and
 it's
 our
 job
 to
 find
 out


fast.


So
 while
 our
 mind
 goes
 through
 all
 the


possibilities
 and
 our
 hands
 are
 going


through
 the
 usual
 triage
 steps,


something
 is
 working
 in
 the
 background.


Our
 integrated
 AI
 bot.


So
 this
 is
 the
 alarm
 in
 our
 monitoring


platform
 Sentinel.
 Malware
 detected
 and


on
 your
 right
 hand
 side
 you
 see
 a
 text


block
 with
 some
 info
 covered
 over.
 It
 is


not
 expected
 that
 you
 read
 it
 all
 but
 it


do
 hold
 key
 information.
 What
 has


happened?
 Which
 system
 has
 triggered
 and


in
 this
 case
 it
 informs
 about
 a
 document


containing
 malicious
 code.


And
 this
 is
 where
 our
 integrated
 AI
 bot


comes
 into
 play.


Instead
 of
 giving
 us
 raw
 data,
 it


creates
 a
 executive
 level
 summary
 of


what
 it
 believes
 has
 happened.


This
 gives
 us
 a
 narrative.
 It
 gives


gives
 us
 a
 storyline,
 something
 that's


actionable.


Then
 it
 goes
 deeper.
 It
 does
 a
 user


analysis.
 Who
 is
 the
 user?
 Is
 the
 user


compromised?
 Is
 it
 expected
 that
 this


type
 of
 user
 work
 with
 this
 type
 of


documents?


Then
 it
 looks
 at
 the
 document.
 When
 was


it
 created?
 When
 was
 it
 last
 modified?


Who
 has
 access
 it
 and
 when?
 And
 it
 takes


all
 of
 this
 information
 and
 generates
 a


timeline
 leading
 up
 to
 the
 alarm.


Then
 it
 gives
 investigation
 guidance.


What
 are
 the
 next
 steps
 or
 recommended


next
 steps
 based
 on
 previous
 cases?


And
 lastly,
 it
 gives
 a
 tentative


conclusion.
 Does
 he
 believe
 this
 is
 a


threat
 or
 a
 false
 alarm?


So
 instead
 of
 starting
 from
 zero,
 we


start
 several
 steps
 ahead
 with
 context,


with
 direction,
 and
 a
 bit
 more
 clarity


about
 the
 alarm.


But
 can
 we
 trust
 the
 information?


The
 short
 answer,
 yes,
 but
 with


oversight,
 with
 human
 oversight.
 It
 is


important
 to
 remember
 that
 an
 AI
 is
 just


a
 tool.
 It
 is
 not
 a
 final
 decision


maker.
 So
 even
 though
 the
 information
 it


gives
 is
 mostly
 accurate
 and
 quite


helpful,
 it's
 still
 based
 on


probabilities.


It
 doesn't
 know
 in
 a
 human
 sense.
 it


predicts
 which
 means
 it
 can
 make


mistakes.


So
 it
 is
 important
 to
 remember
 that
 the


output
 you
 receive
 from
 or
 we
 receive


from
 our
 AI
 model
 can
 be
 looked
 at
 as
 a


first
 step.
 It
 is
 not
 a
 final
 verdict.


It
 is
 up
 to
 us
 to
 validate
 the
 findings,


make
 the
 judgment
 calls
 and
 take
 action.


But
 Johan,
 how
 does
 our
 AI
 airbot
 really


work?


Well,
 that
 is
 a
 very
 interesting


question
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 and
 and


break
 it
 down
 into
 a
 couple
 of
 key


components
 that
 I
 would
 argue
 powers


most
 advanced
 AI
 applications
 uh
 these


days.
 The
 first
 and
 maybe
 the
 the
 most


important
 thing
 to
 know
 about
 is


something
 called
 the
 React
 Loop.
 The


react
 loop
 is
 sort
 of
 a
 five-stage


process
 that
 most
 AI
 workflows
 that
 are


able
 to
 do
 stuff
 and
 can
 react
 to
 things


follow.
 And
 that
 is
 basically
 a
 process


where
 you
 have
 some
 sort
 of
 question
 say


what
 websites
 did
 this
 machine
 visit
 or


what
 uh
 URLs
 did
 this
 user
 talk
 to
 and


then
 that
 is
 the
 initial
 input.
 Then
 the


AI
 has
 a
 series
 of
 tools
 available
 to
 it


and
 it
 can
 reason
 about
 which
 one
 should


I
 use,
 what
 will
 be
 helpful
 to
 try
 to


solve
 this
 task.
 Then
 it
 executes
 one
 of


those
 tools.
 It
 gets
 feedback
 and
 then
 a


new
 prompt
 is
 triggered
 to
 basically


analyze
 the
 feedback
 and
 then
 it
 flows


back
 to
 the
 thought
 step
 again
 where
 it


again
 sort
 of
 iterates
 should
 I
 call
 a


new
 tool?
 Am
 I
 now
 finished?
 And
 then
 it


basically
 iterates
 like
 that
 until
 it


has
 solved
 the
 task.
 And
 this
 is


basically
 the
 way
 most
 reactive
 AI


applications
 work
 these
 days.


In
 addition,
 this
 react
 loop
 works
 quite


well
 for
 simple
 tasks,
 but
 it
 has
 a


problem
 when
 stuff
 starts
 becoming
 more


complex,
 especially
 for
 example
 like


security
 incidents.
 They
 can
 be
 sort
 of


like
 you
 start
 digging
 at
 stuff,
 but


there
 might
 not
 really
 be
 anything
 to


find.
 It's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 diffuse
 problem.


And
 then
 AI
 has
 a
 tendency
 to
 sort
 of


just
 get
 stuck
 in
 a
 rabbit
 hole
 and
 not


really
 achieve
 anything.
 So
 in
 addition


to
 running
 stuff
 in
 an
 React
 loop,
 we


also
 have
 what's
 called
 a
 multi-
 aent


architecture.
 And
 this
 is
 basically


where
 we
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


agents
 with
 their
 own
 set
 of


instructions
 and
 their
 own
 set
 of


basically
 recipes
 on
 how
 to
 solve


different
 problems
 operate


independently.
 And
 then
 we
 have


basically
 a
 top
 level
 manager
 agent
 that


is
 tasked
 with
 generating
 up
 tasks
 and


diving
 them
 up
 until


to
 to
 the
 sub
 agents.
 And
 the
 sub
 aents


might
 be
 for
 example
 an
 agent
 that


specializes
 in
 analyzing
 threat


intelligence
 stuff.
 So
 looking
 at
 like


bad
 domains
 or
 IP
 addresses
 and
 other


kinds
 of
 stuff.
 Or
 it
 might
 be
 an
 agent


that
 specializes
 in
 looking
 at
 for


example
 our
 log
 data
 or
 looking
 at
 our


users
 or
 looking
 at
 machines
 and
 so
 on


and
 so
 forth.
 So
 you
 basically
 divide


and
 conquer
 the
 task
 and
 each
 of
 those


sub
 aents
 run
 their
 task
 in
 their
 own


react
 loop
 with
 sort
 of
 a
 set
 limit
 of


how
 much
 they
 are
 allowed
 to
 use.
 So


that
 if
 one
 just
 gets
 stuckss
 in
 a
 loop


it
 just
 reports
 back
 I
 couldn't
 do


anything
 and
 then
 new
 tasks
 are


generated
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth.
 This


is
 actually
 quite
 similar
 to
 how
 many
 of


these
 modern
 AI
 chat
 apps
 use
 something


called
 deep
 research.
 If
 you
 ever
 click


that
 button,
 what
 basically
 happens
 in


the
 background
 is
 that
 they
 create
 a


bunch
 of
 tasks
 to
 investigate
 and
 then


they
 spin
 that
 off
 to
 agents
 that


usually
 go
 and
 browse
 the
 internet
 to


try
 and
 find
 information
 and
 then
 they


compile
 down
 a
 report
 and
 present
 it
 to


the
 user.
 We
 do
 that
 basically
 as
 well,


but
 we
 just
 look
 at
 all
 our
 internal


stuff
 instead.
 But
 in
 addition
 to
 that,


we
 run
 the
 manager
 agent
 in
 a
 React


loop.
 So
 when
 we
 get
 information
 back,


we
 basically
 create
 a
 new
 iteration
 with


new
 tasks
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth.
 So
 we


run
 this
 up
 to
 maybe
 10
 times
 and
 it


takes
 approximately
 somewhere
 between
 10


to
 15
 minutes
 and
 the
 results
 we
 get
 are


actually
 quite
 good
 I
 would
 say
 like
 we


we
 have
 been
 very
 impressed
 with
 this


workflow.
 The
 final
 thing
 that
 is
 needed


to
 make
 this
 type
 of
 application
 or


workflow
 work
 is
 a
 set
 of
 tools
 like
 you


need
 to
 basically
 build
 tools
 to
 allow


the
 AIS
 to
 fetch
 information
 and
 fetch


knowledge
 from
 your
 infrastructure
 or


whatever
 they
 are
 supposed
 to
 work
 on.


So
 we
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 building
 a


bunch
 of
 integrations
 to
 different
 stuff


to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 information
 where
 they


need
 it.
 Um,
 and
 these
 days
 something


called
 MCP
 is
 like
 a
 very
 big
 hype
 in


the
 AI
 world.
 It's
 basically
 just
 a


standard
 for
 how
 to
 build
 tools.
 So
 this


is
 what
 we
 use
 as
 well
 and
 it
 it
 works


really
 well
 and
 it's
 really
 simple
 to


create
 these
 tools
 these
 days.
 And
 it


also
 has
 the
 advantage
 that
 we
 can
 reuse


these
 tools
 to
 for
 example
 integrate


them
 into
 our
 normal
 AI
 chat
 apps.
 So
 if


you
 want
 a
 more
 interactive
 approach
 to


sort
 of
 looking
 at
 your
 own
 data
 and


just
 doing
 stuff
 then
 you
 can
 just
 do
 it


uh
 in
 like
 a
 normal
 chat
 app
 as
 well.


So
 when
 we
 basically
 compile
 all
 this


together
 we
 get
 a
 really
 really
 good


result
 but
 there
 is
 some
 sort
 of
 I
 would


say
 key
 uh
 drawbacks.
 I
 would
 say


roughly
 90
 to
 95%
 of
 the
 time
 we
 get
 a


really
 good
 result
 that
 is
 like
 we
 can


trust
 it
 almost
 exactly
 and
 all
 we


really
 do
 is
 to
 just
 verify
 that
 the


work
 that
 is
 presented
 is
 correct
 saves


us
 a
 ton
 of
 time
 and
 then
 the
 other
 5%


usually
 what
 happens
 is
 that
 the
 AI
 has


a
 tendency
 to
 think
 that
 stuff
 that


isn't
 really
 bad
 is
 bad
 so
 it's
 you


probably
 quite
 a
 good
 problem
 to
 have


rather
 than
 it
 thinking
 that
 stuff
 that


is
 bad
 is
 is
 uh
 not
 bad
 at
 all
 so


Looking
 a
 bit
 ahead,
 um
 are
 we
 currently


at
 the
 stage
 where
 AIs
 can
 think
 like


humans
 or
 are
 they
 still
 uh
 statistical


parrots?
 Well,
 at least
 from
 our


experience,
 um
 doing
 type
 one
 thinking


and
 simple
 thinking
 that
 is
 basically


solved.
 Like
 an
 AI
 is
 basically
 as
 good


as
 any
 human
 at
 what
 you
 would
 call
 like


very
 reactionary
 quick
 responses
 or


thinking.
 But
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 doing


more
 complex
 tasks,
 that
 requires


context
 switching,
 that
 requires
 sort
 of


deciding
 now
 I
 spent
 enough
 time
 on


this,
 I
 need
 to
 switch
 over
 to
 this
 and


do
 more
 complex
 stuff.
 At least
 from
 our


experience
 and
 what
 we've
 seen
 others
 do


as
 well,
 AIs
 haven't
 really
 gotten
 that


much
 better
 at
 it
 to
 be
 completely


honest.
 And
 all
 of
 the
 workflows
 and


stuff
 that's
 built
 to
 do
 this
 basically


has
 like
 a
 scaffolding
 that
 is
 built
 by


humans
 that
 is
 sort
 of
 a
 designed
 uh


workflow
 or
 recipe
 if
 you
 want
 to
 call


it
 that.
 Um,


so
 that's
 basically
 what
 our
 current


problems
 are.
 But
 looking
 a
 bit
 ahead,


like
 AI
 models
 have
 gotten
 a
 ton
 better


uh
 just
 over
 the
 last
 year.
 So
 like


problems
 that
 we
 had
 to
 work
 around
 with


regards
 to
 like
 context
 length
 or
 like


size
 of
 input
 and
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff
 has


already
 gotten
 uh
 a
 lot
 easier
 to
 solve.


But
 the
 problem
 still
 remains
 that
 is


very
 difficult
 for
 models
 to
 do
 this


complex
 workflow.
 Uh
 but
 of
 course
 if
 we


see
 models
 that
 are
 no
 longer
 just


static
 that
 they
 are
 as
 they
 are
 now


where
 they
 just
 train
 and
 then
 they're


shipped
 out
 to
 the
 world
 and
 and
 they


are
 basically
 producing
 the
 exact
 same


result
 every
 single
 time.
 But
 you
 can


instead
 sort
 of
 just
 tell
 the
 model
 like


this
 is
 not
 how
 we
 do
 it
 in
 our
 firm.


You
 should
 do
 it
 like
 this
 and
 it
 will


be
 able
 to
 learn
 that.
 That
 I
 imagine


would
 be
 like
 the
 next
 step
 that
 needs


to
 be
 solved
 for
 AI
 to
 approach
 more


type
 two
 uh
 solution
 solving.
 But
 we


haven't
 really
 seen
 anything
 that
 uh


that
 we're
 there
 yet.
 But
 there's
 a
 ton


of
 money
 and
 smart
 people
 working
 on
 it.


So,
 so
 we
 will
 see.
 In
 addition,
 uh
 just


to
 pull
 on
 some
 more
 stuff,
 uh
 some


really
 really
 advanced
 um
 flows
 from


something
 called
 alpha
 evolve
 uh
 has


currently
 also
 been
 presented
 where
 they


basically
 let
 AIS
 uh
 modify
 the
 scaffold


that
 builds
 the
 workflow
 and
 change


stuff
 around
 and
 sort
 of
 tweak


parameters
 and
 see
 if
 stuff
 gets
 better


and
 whatnot.
 This
 is
 sort
 of
 the


bleeding
 edge
 where
 AIs
 themselves
 are


starting
 to
 tweak
 and
 work
 on
 the
 the


scaffold
 that
 orchestrate
 these


workflows.
 But
 again
 the
 the
 big
 big


bottleneck
 that
 sort
 of
 we
 see
 with
 both


reasoning
 models
 and
 other
 stuff
 is
 that


you
 need
 the
 problem
 to
 be
 very


verifiable.
 Like
 if
 you
 can
 say
 that


because
 we
 did
 this
 now
 the
 performance


is
 slightly
 better
 or
 now
 the
 solution


is
 correct
 or
 now
 it's
 not
 correct
 and


then
 you
 can
 sort
 of
 reinforce
 and


change
 accordingly.
 But
 problems
 that


are
 not
 verifiable
 are
 still
 very
 much


sort
 of
 difficult
 to
 see
 improvements
 on


I
 would
 say.


So
 yeah
 uh
 but
 sort
 of
 to
 pull
 it
 back


we
 still
 think
 that
 what
 we've
 done
 here


is
 like
 super
 useful.
 We
 we
 use
 it
 all


the
 time
 and
 it
 saves
 us
 a
 ton
 of
 time.


Um
 but
 we
 will
 not
 let
 this
 run
 MBIM


security
 department
 anytime
 soon.
 It's


still
 very
 much
 at
 the
 stage
 where
 we


need
 to
 have
 a
 look
 at
 it
 and
 figure
 out


if
 what
 it
 has
 done
 makes
 sense.


So
 that's
 about
 it
 and
 uh
 if
 anyone
 is


interested
 about
 the
 technical
 details


I'm
 also
 going
 to
 have
 like
 a
 full
 talk


on
 this
 at
 secrets
 festival
 in
 a
 couple


of
 months
 time.
 So
 so
 show
 up
 there.


[Applause]


Thank
 you.
 Uh
 and
 now
 over
 to
 uh
 let
 me


see
 now
 over
 to
 something
 that
 I'm


really
 proud
 of.
 the
 data
 platform
 we


have
 here
 at
 NBIM
 AO
 he
 will
 tell
 us


about
 how
 our
 very
 modern
 uh
 data


platform
 has
 been
 amplified
 by
 uh


utilizing
 AI
 on
 top
 of
 it.
 So,


thank
 you.
 Uh,
 yeah.
 So,
 uh,
 I'm
 Ain.
 I


work
 as
 a
 senior
 data
 engineer
 here
 at


NBIM
 within
 data
 core
 team.
 Uh,
 and
 we


have
 been
 working
 a
 lot
 as
 the
 rest
 of


NBIM
 with
 AI
 these
 days.
 Um,
 so,
 uh,
 I'm


going
 to
 start
 off
 with
 a
 quote.
 Uh
 and


this
 is
 anonymized
 for
 Utron
 so
 no
 one


will
 kind
 of
 recognize
 you
 based
 on


this.
 But
 a
 senior
 management
 member
 uh


told
 me
 um
 that
 if
 uh
 if
 he
 needs
 data


he
 would
 request
 it
 from
 the
 chief


investment
 officer.
 Uh
 the
 CIO
 will
 task


their
 head.
 uh
 they
 will
 direct
 an


analyst
 who
 knows
 the
 data
 and
 SQL
 uh


who
 will
 uh
 actually
 extract
 the
 data


from
 Snowflake
 our
 analytical
 platform


who
 will
 export
 it
 into
 Excel
 uh
 and


then
 send
 it
 back
 through
 the
 same


chain.
 Um
 and
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 not
 very


fast.
 Um
 and
 if
 Tron
 has
 forgotten
 a


column
 or
 dimension
 or
 filter,
 it's
 the


whole
 loop
 again.
 Um
 so
 and
 and
 this
 is


not
 because
 uh
 Tron
 is
 not
 like


competent
 within
 data
 or
 SQL
 or
 anything


uh
 but
 it's
 uh
 due
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 we


have
 immense
 uh
 amounts
 of
 data
 in


snowflake.
 Uh
 and
 to
 put
 this
 uh
 in
 the


context
 of
 our
 data
 platform
 we
 are


ingesting
 hundreds
 of
 sources
 uh
 from


APIs
 from
 uh
 databases
 from
 files
 from


data
 vendors
 etc
 etc.
 Um
 and
 we
 use


Fiverr
 to
 ingest
 that
 data
 into


Snowflake
 where
 we
 host
 our
 uh


analytical
 platform.
 Uh
 and
 there
 we


store
 it
 as
 uh
 raw
 data
 both
 historical


and
 live
 data.
 uh
 and
 then
 we
 use
 DBT


extensively
 to
 connect
 the
 the
 dots
 um


and
 transform
 that
 uh
 that
 raw
 data
 into


model
 data
 uh
 which
 is
 then
 again


consumed
 downstream
 by
 uh
 different


tools
 like
 Tableau
 uh
 Python
 streaml
 and


many
 more
 uh
 and
 uh
 this
 like
 in
 in


total
 this
 amounts
 to
 as
 I
 mentioned


hundreds
 of
 sources
 we
 have
 thousands
 of


terabytes
 of
 data
 uh
 we
 have
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 of
 of
 objects.
 Uh
 so
 Snowflake


is
 pretty
 much
 like
 a
 data
 jungle.
 Uh


it's
 really
 difficult
 to
 kind
 of
 know


your
 your
 way
 around.
 Um
 and
 as
 you
 as


you
 can
 see
 like
 we
 we
 don't
 have
 any


specific
 tools
 in
 this
 architecture
 for


uh
 finding
 data,
 exploring
 data
 uh
 or


for
 uh
 like
 having
 the
 business
 users


closer
 to
 to
 our
 data.
 Uh
 however
 we
 we


have
 like
 a
 madman
 on
 top
 uh
 which
 is


great
 um
 and
 we
 have
 an
 amazing
 uh
 AI


team
 who
 have
 onboarded
 the
 three
 C's
 as


uh
 as
 big
 mentioned
 previously
 uh
 which


is
 like
 a
 perfect
 fit
 for
 this
 purpose


uh
 like
 closing
 the
 gap
 between
 data
 uh


and
 the
 business.
 Um
 and
 two
 two
 of
 the


C's
 in
 this
 context
 uh
 would
 be
 cursor


our
 development
 tool
 for
 example
 and


claude
 which
 is
 probably
 uh
 even
 more
 uh


more
 relevant
 for
 this
 case.
 Uh
 and
 this


is
 where
 we
 do
 like
 our
 everyday
 work.


We
 it
 can
 write
 emails
 uh
 read
 like


think
 chat
 GPT
 if
 you
 haven't
 heard


about
 cloud.
 Uh
 however
 limitation
 for


claude
 and
 these
 LMS
 are
 as
 you
 probably


know
 uh
 they
 are
 trained
 on
 publicly


available
 information
 and
 like
 outdated


information
 based
 on
 which
 models
 you're


using
 for
 example.
 Um
 and
 then
 as
 Yuan


mentioned
 previously
 uh
 uh
 anthropic


launched
 uh
 this
 winter
 the
 the
 concept


of
 model
 context
 protocol
 which
 is
 in


practice
 just
 a
 framework
 for
 connecting


the
 LMS
 with
 whatever
 you
 would
 like.
 Um


so
 we
 have
 built
 our
 own
 MCPS
 uh
 MCP


servers
 model
 context
 protocol
 uh
 in


Python
 and
 they
 can
 speak
 to
 for
 example


Snowflake
 uh
 DBT
 GitHub
 whatever
 API
 or


if
 if
 you
 can
 do
 it
 in
 Python
 you
 can


have
 it
 as
 an
 MCP
 pretty
 much


uh
 and
 this
 kind
 of
 unleashes
 a
 new
 uh


dimension
 of
 of
 using
 for
 example
 claw


or
 cursor.
 So
 uh
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 uh


a
 bit
 small
 for
 you
 uh
 in
 the
 back
 um


but
 I'll
 narrow
 it
 as
 we
 go.
 Uh
 and
 it's


going
 to
 go
 a
 bit
 fast.
 We'll
 rewind
 as


well.
 This
 is
 the
 user
 interface
 of
 a


project
 in
 claude.
 Uh
 so
 uh
 this
 is
 the


snowflake
 data
 catalog
 project
 we
 have


with
 a
 predefined
 set
 of
 instructions
 uh


and
 context.
 Uh
 and
 this
 is
 available
 to


everyone
 and
 everyone
 knows
 how
 to
 use


it
 thanks
 to
 the
 AI
 modules
 and
 training


we
 we've
 had
 internally.
 Uh
 so
 what
 th


could
 do
 here
 uh
 is
 writing
 something
 uh


like
 where
 can
 I
 find
 information
 about


our
 holding
 data
 without
 knowing
 like
 to


be
 honest
 without
 knowing
 even
 what


snowflake
 is.
 And
 then
 you
 can
 see
 uh


the
 LMS
 working
 uh
 with
 this
 response
 um


fetching
 data
 from
 all
 of
 these
 MCPS
 and


tools
 uh
 and
 collecting
 it
 uh


abstracting
 it
 doing
 what
 LM
 do
 best.
 uh


and
 then
 it
 will
 uh
 as
 a
 as
 a
 main


response
 here
 provide
 you
 with
 some


findings
 or
 suggestions
 in
 a
 in
 a
 sense.


Um
 if
 we
 jump
 like
 back
 to
 the
 top
 so
 so


we
 can
 see
 what's
 actually
 going
 on


here.
 uh
 is
 that
 straight
 after
 it
 gets


the
 question
 it
 will
 uh
 find
 out
 that
 oh


this
 is
 a
 good
 use
 case
 for
 the


snowflake
 MCP
 uh
 and
 then
 it
 writes
 some


some
 queries
 SQL
 uh
 pushes
 it
 down
 to


snowflake
 gets
 responses
 based
 on
 that


response
 it
 will
 create
 new
 queries
 push


down
 to
 snowflake
 and
 then
 it
 will
 kind


of
 iterate
 until
 until
 it's
 satisfied


with
 its
 findings
 uh
 and
 then
 it
 will


also
 uh
 use
 that
 information
 to
 find
 out


that
 hey
 oh
 this
 is
 DBT
 models
 uh
 Let's


let's
 find
 some
 some
 quality
 metrics


from
 uh
 the
 DVT
 API
 uh
 which
 we've
 also


integrated
 uh
 and
 then
 it
 uses
 all
 of


these
 information
 from
 Snowflake
 and
 DBT


and
 connects
 it
 into
 a
 response
 like
 a


retrieval
 augmented
 generation
 uh
 where


it
 will
 present
 you
 with
 a
 number
 of


models
 uh
 tables
 with
 uh
 key
 quality


metrics
 responsibles
 uh
 sensitivity
 etc.


Uh
 and
 then
 this
 like
 from
 without
 even


knowing
 what
 snowflake
 is
 uh
 you
 don't


have
 to
 know
 SQL
 or
 anything
 you
 can


pretty
 fast
 find
 out
 uh
 what
 we
 have
 and


where
 we
 have
 it.
 Uh
 and
 since
 this
 is


this
 is
 not
 limited
 to
 meta
 data
 only.


So
 since
 claude
 can
 uh
 can
 use
 uh
 the


the
 snowflake
 data
 you
 could
 also
 keep


going
 and
 asking
 something
 like
 I
 want


to
 explore
 the
 equity
 holdings
 that
 was


a
 match
 for
 our
 use
 case.
 uh
 please


please
 do
 some
 do
 some
 data
 digging.
 Um


and
 then
 it
 will
 once
 again
 create
 SQL


uh
 aggregations
 pull
 out
 different


metrics
 uh
 uh
 slice
 and
 dice
 on
 on


dimensions
 and
 then
 it
 will
 create
 an


artifact
 for
 us
 uh
 performing
 like
 a


visualization
 where
 uh
 you
 will
 get
 the


detailed
 breakdowns
 according
 to
 live


updated
 information
 pretty
 much
 as
 well


as
 a
 text
 response.
 So
 you
 can
 now


browse
 both
 both
 the
 on
 numbers
 and
 and


graphs
 and
 this
 is
 just
 like
 this
 is
 the


tip
 of
 the
 iceberg
 just
 like
 think
 how


this
 could
 be
 used
 in
 developer
 tools
 or


in
 agents
 or
 whatever.
 Uh
 so
 now
 from


tron
 could
 have
 gone
 now
 from
 not


knowing
 where
 that
 is
 to
 actually
 having


the
 data
 ready
 readily
 available.
 Uh
 so


this
 is
 uh
 this
 is
 quite
 amazing
 and


it's
 heavily
 utilized
 across
 the
 the


organization
 as
 well.
 Um
 so
 I'm
 going
 to


I'm
 this
 is
 mindboggling
 to
 me
 as
 well.


Uh
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 um
 wrap
 up
 with
 uh


another
 quote
 stating
 that
 the
 future
 is


not
 tomorrow.
 Uh
 it
 is
 today
 and
 that
 is


of
 course
 Nikolai.
 Yeah.
 Uh
 yeah.
 Thank


you
 for
 listening.


[Applause]


Thank
 you.


Next
 on
 the
 agenda,
 we
 have
 two
 people


that
 are
 going
 to
 present
 how
 we
 have


integrated
 AI
 into
 our
 organization
 and


how
 we
 are
 training
 our
 employees
 on


this.
 So,
 please
 welcome
 Islang
 and
 Stan


Shik.


[Applause]


Thank
 you.
 Um,
 we
 will
 kick
 it
 off
 with


a
 video
 that's
 uh
 tied
 to
 one
 of
 our


training
 programs
 here
 in
 Nic.


5

 1.
 Humans
 have
 always
 been
 in


motion.
 From
 the
 time
 of
 cave
 paintings


where
 we
 captured
 the
 world
 with
 simple


strokes
 to
 the
 agricultural
 revolution,


we
 tamed
 nature,
 built
 societies,
 gained


time
 to
 think,
 then
 came
 the
 machine.
 We


shaped
 steel
 and
 steam,
 crossed


continents,
 produced
 at
 volumes
 the


world
 had
 never
 seen.
 The
 20th
 century


brought
 a
 technological
 explosion.
 We


connected
 the
 planet,
 created
 the


internet,
 exchanged
 ideas
 across


borders,
 and
 now
 artificial


intelligence.
 The
 most
 profound
 tool


humanity
 has
 ever
 created.
 It
 amplifies


our
 creativity,
 accelerates
 our


discoveries,
 and
 helps
 solve
 our


greatest
 challenges.
 This
 isn't
 just


technology.
 It's
 a
 fundamental
 extension


of
 human
 potential,
 a
 partner
 in
 our


continued
 evolution.
 The
 possibilities


are
 endless.
 Where
 the
 journey
 goes
 from


here,


that's
 up
 to
 you.


[Music]


Yes.
 So,
 it's
 all
 up
 to
 each
 and
 uh
 one


of
 us
 to
 leverage
 on
 uh
 AI
 uh
 or
 else


you
 will
 fall
 behind
 as
 we
 heard
 earlier


today
 and
 uh
 AI
 is
 a
 focus
 in
 all
 of


MBIM
 right
 now.
 Yes,
 I
 a
 focus
 in
 all
 of


them.
 The
 tools
 are
 available
 for


everyone
 and
 these
 tools
 are
 of
 no
 value


uh
 if
 no
 one
 is
 using
 them.
 And
 as


Priita
 mentioned
 earlier
 today
 uh
 we
 are


going
 to
 talk
 about
 how
 we
 adopted
 uh


how
 we
 have
 worked
 with
 adoption
 in
 in


NVIM.


A
 few
 months
 ago,
 U
 Nikolai
 gave
 us
 the


task
 of
 becoming
 20%
 more
 efficient.


Uh


he
 was
 not
 really
 sure
 what
 he
 meant
 as


he
 said
 the
 stuff
 I
 do.
 Uh
 because
 the


stuff
 he
 does
 is
 not
 the
 same
 as
 I
 do,


nor
 is
 it
 lean
 or
 a
 trader,
 a
 portfolio


manager,
 an
 analyst,
 a
 developer.
 So
 uh


I'm
 not
 exactly
 sure
 what
 he
 does
 all


the
 time.
 So
 um
 um
 not
 sure
 what
 any
 of


us
 do
 all
 the
 time
 but
 I'll
 get
 back
 to


that.
 So
 we
 need
 to
 try
 and
 approach


this
 a
 bit
 academic.


So
 with
 a
 good
 methology
 we
 turn
 to
 a


professor
 at
 Wharton
 Eton
 Mollik
 and
 he


has
 some
 good
 thoughts
 on
 how
 we
 all


should
 adopt
 AI
 into
 our
 work
 and
 also


into
 our
 daily
 life.


So
 we
 tried
 to
 take
 uh
 Eton's
 work


adapted
 to
 our
 own
 and
 broke
 it
 down


into
 four
 key
 areas.
 Tools,
 project,


processes
 and
 habits.
 So
 first
 of
 all,


as
 we
 have
 discussed
 today,


we
 need
 tools
 to
 get
 everyone
 uh


productive.
 We
 selected
 Claude
 as
 our


chat
 client.
 We
 selected
 curser
 for


development,


copilot
 for
 office
 for
 everything
 office


related,
 transcribing,
 meeting
 etc.
 And


we
 call
 these
 our
 three
 C's.
 Later
 on
 we


added
 the
 fourth
 one
 cloud
 uh
 code.
 And


if
 you
 haven't
 tried
 that
 one
 out,
 you


should
 really
 check
 it
 out.
 It's
 really


good
 for
 cloud
 uh
 for
 vibe
 coding.
 And


as
 I
 were
 mentioning
 here
 earlier,
 the


MCP
 is
 the
 model
 context
 protocol.


It
 was
 a
 standard
 that
 Antropic


delivered.


It
 was
 not
 really
 meant
 for
 production


usage.
 Even
 though
 I's
 uh
 slide
 here


says
 it
 was
 servers,
 it
 was
 really


deployed
 to
 each
 and
 every
 individual


laptop
 in
 the
 whole
 organization.


uh
 we
 still
 rolled
 it
 out
 to
 everyone


and
 as
 you
 expect
 that
 came
 with
 a


much
 expected
 uh
 trouble
 and
 unstability


and
 we
 have
 experienced
 a
 bit
 of
 that


not
 too
 much
 thank
 god
 for
 that
 but
 now


we
 are
 trying
 to
 fix
 that
 because
 the


draft
 specification
 of
 uh
 remote
 MCP
 is


out
 and
 we
 are
 um
 deploying
 that


centrally
 to
 one
 of
 our
 ads
 account
 so


no
 more
 local
 installation
 on
 on
 the


laptops.
 We
 are
 sharing
 the
 knowledge


bases
 in
 one
 AWS
 account
 so
 we
 can
 tap


into
 it
 all
 together.
 We
 are
 sharing


connections
 and
 more.
 And
 you
 might


guess
 where
 we
 then
 are
 going
 with
 such


a
 setup
 as
 this.


And


the
 easiest
 way
 for
 anyone
 to
 learn
 is


to
 try
 the
 things
 out
 for
 yourself.
 And


there
 we
 used
 claw
 projects.


And
 I
 even
 showed
 you
 one
 of
 these
 and


they're
 a
 great
 place
 to
 actually
 just


try
 out
 new
 things,
 improve
 them
 and
 do


your
 P
 uh
 PC
 proof
 of
 concept
 before
 you


take
 it
 anywhere
 further.
 You
 don't
 need


any
 developer
 resources
 or
 anything
 like


that.
 As
 of
 now,
 we
 have
 more
 than


27,000
 different
 project
 in
 CL
 and
 keep


in
 mind
 we
 are
 only
 700
 employees.
 So
 to


us
 that
 is
 a
 lot.
 These
 products
 have


been
 shared.
 They
 are
 private.
 They
 have


been
 thrown
 away.
 We
 have
 a
 lot
 of


duplicates.


Uh
 and
 we
 know
 that.
 But
 it's
 okay
 as


long
 as
 people
 have
 learned
 and
 proved


and
 adopted
 the
 technology.


We
 are
 only
 going
 to
 keep
 the
 best
 one


of
 these
 27,000
 product.
 Nonetheless,


and
 the
 next
 thing
 is
 processes.
 How
 do


we
 do
 our
 work?
 As
 we
 are
 a
 public


institution,
 we
 are
 unfortunately
 pretty


bureaucratic.
 So
 how
 can
 we
 make
 our


processes
 more
 efficient?
 Do
 you
 have


policies
 in
 place
 which
 do
 not
 make


sense
 with
 the
 introduction
 of
 AI?
 So
 we


uh
 as
 an
 example
 have
 thousands
 and


thousands
 of
 pages
 in
 complence
 which
 is


thoughtfully
 created
 by
 people
 but


hardly
 read
 later
 on
 and
 is
 also
 really


difficult
 for
 uh
 anyone
 to
 find
 the


updated
 version
 of
 the
 latest
 page.
 So


is
 that
 the
 right
 way
 to
 approach
 it


going
 forward?
 Probably
 not.
 We
 need
 to


make
 sure
 that
 our
 work
 scales
 beyond


us,
 help
 us
 optimize
 and
 rethink
 how


things
 are
 done


because
 we
 can't
 waste
 time
 solving
 the


same
 problems
 over
 and
 over
 again
 when


you
 can't
 find
 the
 documentation
 you


actually
 need.
 So
 AI
 can
 help
 us
 get
 rid


of
 those
 manual
 processes
 and
 automate


them.


And
 finally,
 the
 habits.


If
 we
 are
 to
 improve
 efficiency,
 we
 need


to
 change
 the
 way
 we
 are
 working.
 We
 if


we
 do
 not
 change
 the
 way
 we
 work,
 we


haven't
 gained
 anything.


But
 habits
 are
 really
 really
 hard
 to


change.
 People
 like
 to
 come
 in
 and
 do


the
 same
 things
 they
 did
 yesterday


because
 that's
 comfortable.
 Changing


habit
 is
 uncomfortable
 for
 everyone.
 So


that
 doesn't
 cut
 it
 anymore.
 You
 need
 to


bring
 AI
 to
 the
 table
 in
 everything
 you


do
 all
 the
 time.
 It
 doesn't
 matter
 if


you're
 writing
 code,
 analyst,
 an


analyzing
 a
 company
 or
 writing
 a
 report.


AI
 is
 your
 own
 personal
 intern
 assistant


to
 whom
 you
 delegate


all
 the
 work
 you
 can,
 the
 boring
 and


also
 the
 fun
 things
 because
 you
 need
 to


free
 up
 more
 of
 your
 own
 time.


So
 to
 change
 habits,
 you
 need
 to
 give


them
 the
 tools
 and
 consistently
 nudge


people
 again
 and
 again
 and
 again
 to
 to


get
 them
 going.
 So
 how
 did
 we
 work
 on


this
 uh
 is
 well
 first
 of
 all
 it's
 really


important
 with
 the
 close
 collaboration


with
 the
 AI
 team
 and
 technology
 and
 uh


our
 team
 people
 development
 uh
 where
 we


work
 with
 pedagogical
 principles
 and


behavioral
 models
 to
 to
 get
 adoption


going
 and
 training
 and
 learning.
 uh
 and


uh
 in
 2025
 we
 have
 tech
 year
 and
 we
 are


focusing
 and
 accelerating
 our
 focus
 on


AI
 and
 just
 listen
 to
 this
 video
 of


Oscar
 who
 is
 a
 AI
 ambassador
 and


Nikolai.


All right
 Nick
 an
 exciting
 year
 to
 the


start
 of
 the
 year
 of
 2025
 in
 AI
 with
 um


Deep
 Seek
 Nvidia
 etc.
 What's
 on
 the


agenda
 for
 for
 AMP
 this
 year?
 Well,
 the


thing
 is
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 totally
 fill


the
 whole
 agenda.
 You
 are
 going
 to
 hear


about
 AI
 every
 day
 when
 you
 wake
 up.
 I'm


going
 to
 totally
 bombard
 you
 with
 it.


It's
 going
 to
 be
 hackathons,
 going
 to
 be


uh
 tech
 days,
 tech
 month,
 tech
 week,


tech
 hour,
 everything.
 Every
 Monday


meeting,
 I'm
 going
 to
 bang
 on
 about
 it


every
 time.
 It's
 totally


transformational
 and
 revolutionary.


Perfect.
 And
 as
 part
 of
 that
 alo
 also
 we


have
 a
 AI
 course
 that
 we're
 doing


internally.
 Why
 is
 it
 so
 important
 that


everyone
 participates
 in
 this?
 Because


we
 just
 need
 to
 get
 everybody
 up
 at
 a


proper
 level
 because
 if
 you
 haven't


started
 to
 use
 it,
 you
 will
 be
 slow
 and


you
 will
 be
 parked.


Yes.


So
 there's
 no
 doubt
 right
 there's
 a


really
 strong
 tone
 from
 the
 top.
 It's
 a


sense
 of
 urgency
 and
 everyone
 in
 the


fund
 is
 measured
 on
 AI
 in
 the


performance
 management
 uh
 processes.
 And


as
 Nikolai
 says
 um
 if
 you
 don't
 use
 or


adopt
 AI,
 someone
 else
 uh
 will
 surpass


you
 as
 he
 as
 he
 said
 earlier.
 But
 diving


into
 techare,
 what
 do
 we
 actually
 do?
 So


as
 you
 can
 see
 here,
 it's
 quite
 packed


with
 activities.
 Uh
 but
 uh
 to
 highlight


a
 few,
 we
 started
 off
 with
 a


comprehensive
 AI
 ambassadors
 program.


uh
 and
 uh
 we
 have
 now
 40
 uh
 ambassadors


and
 we
 have
 done
 training
 uh
 in
 two


rounds.
 So
 one
 completed
 and
 one
 is


ongoing
 at
 the
 moment.
 Uh
 and
 then
 we


have
 uh
 tech
 days
 uh
 that's


inspirational
 days,
 the
 one
 in
 the


orange
 with
 the
 star.
 Uh
 so
 we
 just
 had


one
 super
 um
 exciting
 with
 different


types
 of
 inspirational
 speeches
 but
 also


really
 hands-on
 where
 you
 learn
 and


really
 get
 your
 fingers
 dirty.
 So
 the


aim
 is
 to
 to
 inspire
 and
 to
 learn
 in


this
 uh
 uh
 different
 happenings
 and
 they


are
 hosted
 in
 all
 our
 local
 offices


across
 the
 globe.


Then
 we
 also
 have
 had
 AI
 developers


training
 uh
 with
 uh
 as
 you've
 heard


about
 MCPS
 and
 RAG
 um
 and
 we
 will
 uh
 we


just
 finished
 our
 AI
 upskill
 program
 and


after
 summer
 we
 will
 also
 have
 a
 um


training
 for
 uh
 in
 vibe
 coding.


So
 let's
 dive
 into
 AI
 upskill.
 Uh
 and


this
 contains
 of
 seven
 modules.
 Uh
 it's


mandatory.
 So
 everyone
 needs
 to
 take


these
 modules.
 And
 it's
 training
 on
 our


three
 C's.
 So
 now
 you
 probably
 know


them.
 It's
 cloth,
 cursor,
 and
 co-let.


And
 this
 is
 essentially
 about
 changing


habits.
 Um
 and
 that's
 a
 consistent
 theme


throughout.
 Um
 and
 we
 are
 really
 trying


to
 take
 it
 down
 removing
 all
 the
 bus
 and


reaching
 that
 was what's
 in
 it
 for
 me


mentality
 or
 dimension
 and
 the
 goal
 is


to
 become
 more
 efficient


um
 and
 understand
 how
 to
 get
 going
 to


lower
 those
 barrier
 that
 the
 was
 talking


about
 in
 terms
 of
 changing
 the
 habits


and
 these
 uh
 sessions
 are
 bitsized
 uh


meaning
 30
 minutes
 every
 other
 week
 and


really
 hands-on


Um
 so
 what
 about
 the
 effect?
 What
 are
 we


are
 we
 succeeding
 and
 what
 are
 we
 seeing


so
 far?
 Um
 well
 working
 with
 training
 or


learning
 and
 development
 it's
 not
 always


that
 you
 see
 uh
 a
 change
 in
 behavior
 or


a
 habit
 necessarily
 but
 in
 this


initiative
 we
 can
 actually
 track
 it.
 So


we
 see
 a
 really
 clear
 connection
 after


each
 module.
 It's
 a
 all-time
 high


activity
 in
 uh
 cursor
 or
 claude
 and
 we


have
 now
 250
 active
 uh
 users
 in
 cursor


who
 um
 uh
 is
 using
 it
 for
 coding
 which


is
 really
 amazing
 and
 we
 have
 estimated


so
 far
 that
 we
 have
 saved
 150
 million
 in


work
 hours.


So
 um


looking
 ahead
 well
 um
 we
 need
 to
 keep
 up


the
 pace
 right
 uh
 it's
 an
 extreme
 race


between
 the
 AI
 companies
 they
 uh
 they


deliver
 new
 things
 all
 the
 time
 and
 uh


we
 evolve
 alongside
 uh
 of
 AI
 and
 with


any
 new
 technology
 as
 we
 all
 know
 uh
 it


will
 be
 hiccups
 it
 will
 be
 setbacks


uh
 but
 when
 something
 doesn't
 work
 100%


you
 don't
 abandon
 it.
 You
 try
 again
 uh


and
 you
 find
 new
 ways.
 So
 this
 will


require
 adaptability,
 resilience,
 a


growth
 mindset


uh
 and
 uh
 testing,
 failing
 and
 learning.


Those
 who
 will
 do
 that,
 they
 will


succeed.
 So
 looking
 ahead
 now,
 we
 need


to
 think
 totally
 uh
 different
 not
 only


improving
 our
 current
 processes
 but


actually
 fundamentally
 looking
 at
 how
 we


work.
 Yes.
 So
 we
 I
 believe
 we
 hit
 the


20%
 efficiency
 months
 ago
 and
 the


Nikolai
 and
 the
 leadership
 backing
 for


that
 has
 been
 crucial.
 But
 goals
 evolve


as
 Nikolai
 has
 said
 a
 couple
 of
 time


this
 is
 an
 oil
 moment
 once
 in
 a
 lifetime


opportunity.
 AI
 will
 totally
 change
 how


we
 work.
 So


history
 shows
 us
 that
 real
 efficiency


gains
 are
 only
 come
 when
 we
 stop
 doing


something
 or
 doing
 the
 task
 entirely.
 So


the
 washing
 machine
 didn't
 improve


laundry
 by
 20%,
 it
 freed
 up
 time,
 right?


Dishwasher
 element
 eliminated
 hand


washing.


Calculators
 killed
 manual
 calculation.


Uh
 now
 the
 robot
 X1
 nail
 can
 uh
 clean
 up


your
 house,
 do
 your
 dishes
 and
 cook
 for


you.
 So
 you
 have
 freed
 up
 even
 more


time.
 So
 for
 us
 the
 same
 principle


applies.
 We
 need
 to
 radically
 think


different
 about
 work
 itself.


Much
 of
 what
 we
 do
 is
 sudo
 work,
 a
 task


that
 exists
 only
 because
 of
 how
 our
 work


is
 structured,
 not
 because
 they
 create


value
 themsel.


We
 fill
 out
 forms
 that
 feed
 other
 forms.


We
 attend
 meetings
 to
 plan
 meetings.
 Uh


we
 create
 reports
 that
 nobody
 reads.


Uh,


efficiency
 isn't
 about
 doing
 more
 work.


It's
 about
 doing
 the
 right
 work.
 Let


humans
 do


what
 humans
 excel
 at.
 Trust
 AI
 with


everything
 else.
 Thank
 you.
