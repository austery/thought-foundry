Hey
 everyone,
 it's
 Anna.
 Before
 we
 start


the
 show,
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 a
 question.


And
 please
 don't
 be
 offended
 if
 it


sounds
 a
 little
 direct.
 Okay,
 here
 goes.


Are
 money
 issues
 affecting
 your


relationship?
 Money
 can
 be
 awkward
 and


sensitive
 to
 talk
 about
 how
 much
 to


save,
 how
 much
 to
 spend,
 who
 makes
 the


decisions
 about
 what.
 But
 if
 you're
 not


talking
 about
 money,
 it
 can
 cause
 even


bigger
 problems.
 We
 have
 an
 episode


coming
 up
 soon
 where
 I'll
 be
 talking
 to


Rammit
 Sati.
 He
 hosted
 the
 Netflix
 show


How
 to
 Get
 Rich.
 He's
 written
 books
 on


personal
 finance
 and
 he's
 especially


good
 at
 helping
 couples
 resolve
 their


differences
 around
 money
 and
 start
 to


actually
 enjoy
 talking
 about
 it.
 If
 this


sounds
 like
 something
 you
 want
 to
 be
 a


part
 of,
 please
 send
 us
 a
 short
 voice


memo.
 Tell
 us
 about
 a
 moment
 you
 and


someone
 you
 loved
 had
 tension
 around


money.
 It
 could
 be
 your
 partner.
 It


could
 be
 a
 family
 member.
 Tell
 us
 what


happened
 to
 set
 it
 off,
 what
 you
 said
 to


each
 other
 or
 didn't
 say,
 and
 how
 you


felt
 about
 all
 of
 it.
 We
 might
 play
 your


voice
 on
 the
 show
 and
 hear
 Ramit's


advice
 on
 what
 you
 can
 do
 differently.


Please
 email
 your
 voice
 memo
 to


modernlove
 podcastny
 times.com
 by


November
 3rd.
 There's
 instructions
 in


our
 show
 notes.
 Please
 check
 those
 out.


All
 right,
 here's
 today's
 episode.


>> Love
 now
 and
 fall
 in
 love.
 I
 love


stronger
 than
 anything.


>> For
 the
 love
 of
 love.


>> And
 I
 love
 you
 more
 than
 anything.


There's
 still
 love


[Music]


>> from
 the
 New
 York
 Times.
 I'm
 Anna


Martin.
 This
 is
 Modern
 Love.
 WNBA
 finals


just
 ended.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 friends
 are


really
 jealous
 of
 me
 because
 today
 I'm


talking
 to
 one
 of
 the
 breakout
 stars
 of


the
 2025
 season,
 Natasha
 Cloud.
 Natasha


is
 one
 of
 New
 York
 Liberty's


powerhouses.
 She's
 outspoken.
 She's
 got


immense
 amounts
 of
 swag.
 and
 she's


really
 freaking
 good
 at
 basketball.
 When


I
 watch
 her
 play,
 I
 see
 someone
 who
 is


strong
 and
 confident,
 self-
 assured,
 but


she
 wasn't
 always
 that
 way.
 Today,
 I


talked
 to
 Natasha
 Cloud
 about
 how
 a


conversation
 with
 her
 mother
 changed


everything
 she
 thought
 she
 knew
 about


who
 she
 was
 and
 all
 the
 work
 she's
 done


in
 the
 years
 since
 to
 figure
 out
 who
 she


really
 is.


[Music]


>> Natasha
 Cloud,
 welcome
 to
 Modern
 Love.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.
 Do
 you
 prefer


TSH?
 Everyone
 calls
 you
 TSH.
 I
 don't


know
 you
 so
 well
 yet.
 What
 do
 you
 like?


>> You
 can
 call
 me
 Tash.
 Tasha.
 Natasha
 is


really
 like
 for
 my
 mama,
 and
 when
 she


calls
 me
 Natasha,
 I'm
 like,
 "Oh
 [ __ ]


what
 did
 I
 do?"


>> You're
 a
 new
 New
 Yorker.
 What's
 your


go-to
 bodega
 order?


>> I'm
 very
 basic
 with
 my
 food,
 but
 I
 love


me
 a
 good
 bacon,
 egg,
 and
 cheese
 with


the
 double
 cheese.
 Make
 that
 bacon
 extra


crispy
 cuz
 I
 don't
 want
 no
 fat
 on
 that.


>> Any
 sauce,
 ketchup,
 hot
 sauce?
 No.
 I


like
 a
 little
 hot
 sauce,
 but
 honestly,


I'm
 a
 grape
 jelly
 girl.
 I
 know.
 I


>> on
 the
 bacon,
 egg,
 and
 cheese.


>> Listen,
 don't
 knock
 it
 until
 you
 try
 it.


>> Wait,
 I
 really
 don't
 like
 that.


>> No,
 I'm
 telling
 you,
 you
 can't
 knock
 it


until
 you
 try
 it.


>> Cuz
 the
 salty
 and
 the
 sweet.


>> Yeah,
 I
 tell
 you,
 it
 balances
 so
 well.


Don't
 overdo
 it
 with
 the
 jelly.
 Just
 a


little
 bit.


>> And
 you're
 putting
 it
 in
 the
 sandwich.


You're
 not
 dipping
 it
 in.


>> I'm
 not
 dipping
 it.
 I'm
 putting
 a
 little


bit
 on,
 smacking
 that
 sandwich.
 I'm


busting
 that
 [ __ ]
 down.


>> I
 have
 never
 heard
 of
 this.
 This
 could


be
 an
 innovation.


>> Let
 me
 put
 you
 on.
 Let
 me
 bring
 the


Philly
 to
 New
 York.


>> This
 is
 the
 TSH
 Sam.


>> This
 is
 the
 cloud.


>> My
 god.
 That's
 the
 cloud.


>> Um,
 you
 are
 the
 first
 athlete
 I've
 ever


interviewed.


>> It
 It
 is
 funny
 to
 me
 that
 we've
 never


had
 an
 athlete
 on
 because
 we're
 a
 show


about
 love
 and
 relationships
 and
 it


strikes
 me
 that
 relationships
 between


teammates
 are
 incredibly
 close.
 Can


sometimes
 be
 complicated.


>> Let's
 situate
 you
 in
 your
 role
 on
 your


team.
 You're
 a
 point
 guard.


>> Yes.


>> You
 know,
 when
 I
 think
 about
 sort
 of


hard
 things
 that
 a
 team
 goes
 through


collectively,
 I
 think
 of
 losses.


>> Sorry
 to
 say
 this,
 but
 it
 is
 true.


>> Yeah,
 we
 were
 sad
 girls.


>> Yeah,
 you
 were
 sad
 girls.
 You
 were
 out


of
 the
 playoffs
 in
 the
 first
 in
 the


first
 round.
 I
 wonder
 like
 how
 do
 you
 as


a
 leader
 on
 the
 team,
 how
 do
 you
 handle


losses?


>> Who
 I'm
 a
 sore
 loser,
 so


I
 don't
 even


>> I
 feel
 like
 you
 don't
 get
 to
 your
 level


without
 being
 a
 sore
 loser,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 Like
 I
 truly
 hate
 losing.
 It
 could


literally
 be
 an
 Uno
 game.
 Like
 Izzy


kicks
 my
 ass
 in
 Uno
 all
 the
 time.


>> Is
 he
 your
 girlfriend?
 We'll
 talk
 about


it.


>> Yes.
 Y'all
 don't
 play
 her
 in
 Uno.
 She
 be


acting
 like
 this
 cute
 little
 sweet
 Oh,
 I


know
 what
 I'm
 doing.
 And
 then
 boom,
 Uno


out.
 But
 I'm
 like,
 what
 the
 [ __ ]
 you


mean?
 You
 out.
 We
 just
 started.
 So,
 I'm


super
 competitive.
 Um,
 I
 will
 say
 that


the
 accountability
 factor
 even
 for


myself
 is
 like
 when
 adversity
 hits
 and


there's
 always
 like
 es
 and
 flows
 of
 a


season
 is
 I
 have
 to
 remain
 more


consistent.
 Even
 in
 my
 frustrations
 of


like


>> I
 don't
 feel
 like
 we're
 playing
 well,


we're
 not
 jelling,
 we're
 not
 the
 C
 what


what
 is
 going
 like
 I'll
 be
 frustrated


and
 then
 those
 moments
 the


accountability
 for
 me
 for
 next
 year
 is


to
 be
 more
 consistent.


>> Tell
 me
 what
 that
 looks
 like
 for
 you
 and


we
 throw
 around
 this
 term
 embodied,
 but


let's
 say
 you're
 feeling
 really
 fired


up.
 You're
 like
 pissed
 about
 a
 loss,


whatever.
 What
 do
 you
 do
 to
 calm


yourself
 down
 specifically?
 Is
 it
 like


you
 close
 your
 eyes?
 You
 take
 a
 breath?


Like
 what's
 your
 method?
 Um,
 I'm
 a
 big


like
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 throw
 some
 [ __ ]


first
 and
 probably


So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 remove
 myself.


>> Put
 it
 at
 the
 wall.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 remove
 myself
 from
 the


actual
 team
 setting.
 I'm
 probably
 going


to
 go
 into
 like
 our
 weight
 room
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 throw
 like
 a
 medicine
 ball
 or


something
 to
 get
 my
 initial
 like


out
 of
 me.


>> I
 need
 to
 do
 that.
 Wait,
 can
 we
 both
 do


that?
 Three,
 two,
 one.


>> [ __ ]


>> I
 needed
 that
 actually.


>> Thank
 you.
 Yeah.
 Sometimes
 it's
 just


like
 you
 just
 got
 to
 do
 it.


>> You
 just
 got
 to
 get
 it
 down.


>> No
 medicine
 ball
 in
 the
 studio
 right


now.
 So
 keep
 going.


>> The
 walls
 look
 really
 nice
 in
 here.
 So


we
 we
 ain't
 trying
 to
 pay.


>> Pretty
 new.
 Okay.
 So
 you
 throw
 the


medicine
 ball
 then
 what
 do
 you
 do?


>> So
 like
 inhale
 for
 six,
 hold
 for
 one,


exhale
 for
 seven
 to
 regulate
 my
 body
 and


my
 nervous
 system
 like
 meditation
 and


then
 I'll
 go
 back
 in
 and
 if
 I
 feel
 like


I
 have
 to
 get
 into
 us
 a
 little
 bit,
 I


will.
 But
 it
 will
 be
 in
 a
 very
 calm
 um


demeanor.


>> But
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 of
 like
 it's


not
 just
 solely
 on
 me.
 Um,
 I
 have
 a


whole
 team
 behind
 me.
 So,
 there
 will
 be


moments
 where
 I'll
 do
 that
 and
 I'll
 come


back
 in
 the
 locker
 room
 and
 I'll
 just


sit
 and
 I'll
 wait
 for
 Sab
 to
 say


something.
 I'll
 wait
 for
 Stewie
 or
 JJ


because
 it's
 collaborative.
 As
 the
 point


guard,
 I
 talk
 enough.
 The
 ball
 is
 always


in
 my
 hands.
 I'm
 always
 directing
 and


pointing.
 And
 so,
 sometimes
 it
 is
 good


for
 me
 just
 to
 sit
 back
 and
 shut
 the


[ __ ]
 up,
 too.


>> It
 sounds
 like
 these
 are
 skills
 you
 had


to
 learn.
 You
 were
 maybe
 not
 this
 way.


>> No.


>> When
 you
 were
 younger?


>> No.
 Is
 there
 a
 story
 you
 can
 share
 of


young
 Tosh
 in
 sports
 or
 not?
 Sort
 of


experiencing
 an
 adversity
 or
 a
 hardship


and
 how
 you
 reacted
 with
 that
 fire
 sort


of
 the
 older
 the
 younger
 version
 of
 you.


I
 mean,


>> um,
 man,
 I
 feel
 like
 I'm
 about
 to
 go


deep
 with
 this
 question,
 but
 I
 think
 the


very
 um
 beginning
 for
 me
 and
 my
 story
 is


that
 uh
 my
 mom
 is
 my
 real
 mom.
 My
 dad


would
 technically
 be
 my
 stepdad,
 but


that's
 not
 who
 he
 is
 to
 me.
 That
 is
 my


real
 father.
 Emma
 Mloud
 is
 the
 man
 that


took
 me
 in
 and
 raised
 me
 and
 gave
 me


everything
 that
 I
 needed
 to
 be


successful
 in
 life.
 And
 the
 same
 with
 my


mom.
 You
 know,


>> if
 you're
 cool
 with
 it,
 I
 want
 to
 sort


of
 break
 down
 what
 you're
 talking
 about.


>> You
 were
 raised
 by
 who
 and
 where?


>> Emil
 and
 Sharon
 Cloud
 in
 Broomall,


Pennsylvania,
 right
 outside
 of


Philadelphia.


>> Um,
 an
 allh
 family.
 I'm
 the
 only
 one
 of


mixed
 race
 in
 my
 family.
 Even
 uh
 just


going
 back
 this
 weekend
 for
 a
 funeral.


Um,
 seeing
 my
 whole
 family,
 it's
 just


like,
 man,
 I
 literally
 am
 the
 black


sheep.


But
 I
 will
 say
 in
 my
 family's
 defense,


like
 I
 truly
 never
 felt
 different
 in
 my


family.
 And
 so
 I


>> I
 was
 so
 innocent
 and
 people
 really
 get


tickled
 by
 this
 one.
 Like
 I
 tell
 them,


but
 I'm
 like
 I
 was
 like
 11,
 like
 when
 I


was
 like,
 "Oh,
 I'm
 blackety
 black."
 Cuz


my
 dad,
 he
 actually
 tans
 like
 like
 I'm


not
 even
 playing.
 Like
 we
 would
 be
 the


same
 color.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 "Oh,
 I
 just


keep
 it
 for
 the
 duration."
 like


>> this
 just
 a
 year
 round
 thing
 for
 me.


Yeah.


>> That
 shows
 how
 innocent
 children
 truly


are
 and
 we
 teach
 them
 what
 they
 fully


believe
 later
 in
 life
 because
 I
 would


have
 never
 known
 that
 I
 was
 any
 bit


different
 because
 my
 family
 never


treated
 me
 different.


>> And
 how
 did
 your
 mom
 or
 your
 dad
 or
 your


siblings
 back
 when
 you
 were
 11
 before


you
 sort
 of
 clocked
 that
 you
 were


different?
 like


>> how
 did
 they
 did
 they
 talk
 about
 about


you
 and
 and
 your
 relation
 to
 the
 family


or
 it
 wasn't
 it
 was
 like
 not
 an


exception
 at
 all
 just
 something
 you


didn't
 speak
 about


>> it
 was
 just
 like
 this
 is
 our
 family


>> this
 is
 what
 our
 family
 looks
 like
 and


this
 is
 I've
 never
 like
 me
 and
 my


siblings
 are
 technically
 half
 siblings


none
 of
 us
 would
 ever
 say
 that


>> but
 at
 the
 time
 too
 you
 didn't
 know


>> I
 didn't
 know
 I
 didn't
 know
 and
 so
 you


know
 it
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 point
 where
 like


you
 as
 a
 kid
 start
 getting
 curious
 and


you're
 intrigued
 and
 you're
 starting
 to


see
 how
 like
 again
 that
 outside
 world
 is


treating
 you.
 So,
 shout
 out
 to
 my
 mom


for
 the
 relationship
 that
 we
 do
 have


that
 I
 was
 even
 comfortable
 to
 just
 be


like
 what's
 going
 on.
 So,
 like
 I
 can


literally
 tell
 you
 when
 I
 asked
 her,
 how


I
 asked
 her.


>> Please,
 if
 you
 want
 to,
 I
 would
 love
 to


know
 that
 story.


>> We
 were
 just
 on
 the
 way
 to
 Blockbuster


and
 I
 was
 like,
 man,
 like


>> what
 what
 is
 this?
 Like,
 why
 do
 I
 look


different
 than
 our
 old
 our
 family?
 I


think
 I
 was
 like
 12
 for
 real.
 And
 my
 mom


was
 just
 like
 I
 mean
 she
 just
 kind
 of


laid
 it
 out
 for
 me
 like


>> this
 is
 what
 happened.
 Um
 you
 know
 it


was
 a
 tough
 time
 in
 our
 marriage.
 This


is
 her
 and
 your
 dad.


>> Yeah.
 This
 is
 what
 happened
 and
 I
 made
 a


decision
 that
 you
 know
 I
 take
 full


responsibility
 of
 and
 she
 was
 like
 your


dad
 was
 amazing
 because
 the
 moment
 I


told
 him
 yes
 he's
 hurt
 as
 a
 man
 he's


hurt.
 Um


>> and
 what
 was
 the
 decision?
 Did
 she
 tell


you
 like
 I
 had
 an
 affair?
 How
 did
 she


say
 it?
 Do
 you
 remember?


>> Yeah.
 essentially
 said
 it
 in
 like
 what
 a


strong
 woman
 to
 just
 be
 like
 man
 this
 is


what
 it
 is
 when
 her
 kid
 is
 asking
 her.


Um
 and
 there
 wasn't
 like
 any
 secrets


from
 my
 mom
 about
 the
 situation.
 The


only
 thing
 that
 and
 I
 really
 appreciated


that
 my
 mom
 did
 this
 in
 hindsight
 of


like
 when
 you're
 18
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 his


name.
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 everything


>> who
 is
 your
 biological
 father.


>> Yeah.
 My
 sperm
 donor.
 uh
 whenever
 like


when
 you're
 18
 and
 you're
 of
 age
 and
 you


can
 make
 like
 that
 adult
 decision
 of


whether
 you
 want
 to
 go
 look
 for
 him
 or


not,
 that
 will
 be
 like
 I
 will
 tell
 you


on
 your
 18th
 birthday
 immediately.
 And
 I


was
 like,
 okay,
 I
 respect
 that.
 Um


obviously
 I
 was
 left
 with
 like
 a
 lot
 of


questions.


>> Oh
 my
 god,
 how
 are
 you
 supposed
 to,
 you


know,
 just
 continue?


>> I
 remember
 going
 home
 and
 just
 being


like,


>> so
 he
 didn't
 want
 me.
 That's
 essentially


what
 it
 comes
 down
 to,
 right?
 And
 you're


a
 kid
 that's
 like,
 well,
 at least
 I


wanted
 in
 this
 home.
 So
 even
 from
 like
 a


young
 kid,
 I
 knew
 um
 my
 dad
 took
 care
 of


everything
 that
 I
 ever
 needed.
 He's


given
 me
 everything
 that
 I've
 ever


needed.
 So
 there's
 no
 need
 to
 go
 look


for
 this
 sperm
 donor.
 Like
 there's
 no


need
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 want
 to.
 And
 so
 when


I
 was
 18
 and
 my
 mom
 like
 I
 remember
 come


down
 for
 school
 while
 I
 was
 in
 my


Catholic
 school
 outfit
 and
 she
 was
 like,


"Do
 you
 want
 to
 know?"
 And
 I
 was
 like


>> a
 few
 years
 later
 you
 you
 were
 18
 and
 it


was
 the
 time
 Yeah.
 you
 could
 ask
 this


question.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 "Yeah,
 I
 want
 to


know."
 Um,
 and
 she
 told
 me
 he
 lived
 a


town
 over.
 His
 son
 was
 super
 athletic,


played
 football
 at
 a
 local
 school.
 Um,


and
 it's
 like
 crazy
 because
 it's
 like
 I


know
 you
 saw
 my
 name.
 I
 know
 you
 saw
 my


mom's
 name
 in
 that
 paper.
 I
 know
 you
 saw


my
 dad's
 name
 in
 that
 paper.


>> You
 were
 a
 super
 successful.


>> I'm
 super
 successful.
 I'm
 playing
 at
 all


local
 schools.
 I'm
 in
 the
 newspaper


constantly.
 So,
 I'm
 like,
 I
 know
 you
 are


seeing
 me.


>> Um,
 and
 my
 mom
 was
 like,
 what
 do
 you


want
 to
 do?
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 just


wanted
 to
 know.
 Like
 that
 for
 me
 was
 the


I
 think
 final
 like
 chapter
 close
 to
 me


is
 like
 I
 just
 wanted
 to
 know
 his
 name.


Um
 I
 wanted
 to
 know
 where
 he
 was
 from.
 I


wanted
 to
 know
 just
 about
 him.
 Um
 and


that
 was
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 I
 ever


wanted
 to
 know
 him.
 I
 didn't
 ever
 feel


like
 I
 needed
 to
 go
 and
 be
 like
 this
 is


who
 the
 [ __ ]
 I
 am.
 This
 is
 who
 you
 left.


You
 don't
 deserve
 you
 don't
 deserve
 to


know
 me.
 You
 don't
 deserve
 to
 even
 sit


down
 in
 front
 of
 me.
 You
 don't
 deserve


that.
 Um
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 what


I
 would
 call
 it
 like
 that
 privilege
 to


me
 to
 my
 energy
 and
 to
 who
 Emma
 Cloud


raised
 me
 to
 be.
 You
 don't
 get
 that
 and


Sharon.
 So
 yeah,
 that
 was
 I
 think
 that


was
 like
 my
 first
 I
 would
 say
 adversity


in
 life.
 But
 it
 literally
 has
 shaped
 me


and
 molded
 me
 into
 who
 I
 am,
 who
 why
 I


am
 the
 way
 I
 am.
 And
 especially
 in
 my


activism,
 like


>> I've
 had
 to
 deal
 with
 my
 own
 siblings


voting
 for
 Trump


>> when
 you
 need
 to
 navigate
 and
 talk
 to


[ __ ]
 frustrating
 ass
 people.
 I've


done
 it.
 I've
 done
 it
 in
 my
 own
 family.


Uh
 I've
 had
 people
 that
 have
 been
 like,


"You're
 racist."
 I'm
 like,
 "In
 a


allwhite
 family?
 You
 don't
 know
 me."


>> I'm
 just
 thinking
 about
 it's
 so
 vivid
 in


your
 mind.
 It's
 clear,
 you
 know,
 on
 the


way
 to
 Blockbuster,
 coming
 down
 the


stairs
 and
 your
 Catholic,
 there
 are


these
 moments
 in
 your
 life
 that
 are


burned
 into
 your
 brain.
 These
 like


pivotal
 moments.
 And
 I'm
 so
 struck
 that


your
 first
 reaction


>> wasn't
 rage
 as
 we
 spoke
 about.
 It
 was


love
 for
 your
 mom
 and
 love
 for
 your
 dad.


>> Absolutely.


>> And
 I
 don't
 I
 just
 want
 to
 call
 out
 like


I
 don't
 think
 that
 I've
 heard
 stories


about
 people
 realizing,
 you
 know,
 maybe


their
 their
 parent
 wasn't
 who
 they


thought
 they
 were.
 That
 is
 not
 a


reaction
 that
 everyone
 has.
 Immediate


>> compassion
 for
 your
 parents,
 for
 your


mom
 who
 made
 this
 choice.
 understanding


of
 even
 what
 it
 means
 as
 a
 33year-old


that
 has
 been
 in
 relationships
 and
 how


hard
 relationships
 are
 to
 maintain
 and


>> to
 uh
 commit
 to
 to
 to
 withstand
 all
 the


trials
 and
 tribulations
 of
 it.
 Like


>> I
 understand
 my
 mom
 more
 so
 now
 as
 an


adult
 too,
 which
 is
 like
 really
 cool.


But


>> yeah,
 even
 from
 a
 young
 time,
 I
 think


like
 I've
 always
 been
 rooted
 in
 love.


Even
 my
 dad
 to
 take
 me
 in
 as
 his
 own,


that's
 rooted
 in
 love.


>> You
 keep
 saying
 that.
 I
 mean,
 that's


another
 remarkable
 aspect
 of
 the
 story.


>> What
 a
 good
 [ __ ]
 man.


>> I
 mean,
 and
 did
 she
 share
 with
 you
 when


when
 you
 were
 young
 sort
 of
 what
 that


conversation
 between
 them
 was
 like,
 if


there
 even
 was
 a
 conversation?


>> I
 mean,
 [ __ ]
 she
 had
 to
 tell
 him.


>> Well,
 that's
 true.


>> A,
 she's
 pregnant
 and
 B,
 this
 baby
 going


to
 come
 out
 a
 little
 bit
 brown.
 So,
 we


got
 to
 tell
 we
 got
 to
 tell
 him.


question
 be
 to
 be
 honest
 with
 him
 like
 I


I
 commend
 her
 for
 that
 for
 um
 even
 being


able
 to
 sit
 down
 and
 have
 that


conversation.
 But


>> um
 she
 like
 even
 told
 me
 like
 without


hesitation
 he
 was
 like


>> man
 to
 see
 how
 much
 my
 dad
 loves
 my
 mom


even
 despite
 all
 that
 how
 much
 he
 loved


me
 and
 my
 siblings.
 I'm
 one
 of
 five.
 So


like
 I
 truly
 never
 ever
 needed
 anything


else
 besides
 him.
 I
 feel
 wholeheartedly


rooted
 in
 that.


>> Can
 I
 ask
 you
 like
 did
 you
 ever
 have
 a


conversation
 with
 your
 dad
 about
 what


this
 meant
 to
 you
 and
 your
 relationship?


>> Uh,
 honestly,
 no.
 Cuz
 my
 dad
 is
 like


such
 a
 simple
 man.
 Even
 when
 like
 like
 I


remember
 having
 to
 tell
 my
 mom
 that
 I


was
 gay
 and
 I
 like
 was
 crying
 and


sobbing
 and
 I
 was
 like
 and
 she
 was
 like,


"Why
 are
 you
 crying?"
 I'm
 like,
 "I
 don't


[ __ ]
 know.
 This
 is
 a
 lie.
 I
 don't


even
 feel
 like
 I
 should
 have
 to
 [ __ ]


come
 home
 and
 tell
 you
 that
 I'm
 dating
 a


girl.
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 should
 be
 able
 to


bring
 my
 person
 home


>> and
 that
 be
 normalized.
 But
 even
 like


with
 that,
 I
 never
 told
 my
 dad
 I
 was


gay.
 I
 literally
 just
 brought
 my


girlfriend
 home
 and
 he
 was
 like,
 "It's


nice
 to
 meet
 you."


>> Like
 my
 dad
 is
 like
 truly
 the
 most


simple.
 Everyone
 that
 meets
 him,
 he


looks
 like
 the
 old
 man
 from
 Up.
 Um,
 he


is
 like
 the
 sweetest
 hearted.
 Everyone


loves
 talking
 to
 him.
 Everyone
 random


ass
 strangers.
 So
 like
 this
 is
 just
 who


my
 dad
 is.


>> He
 really
 wants
 my
 mom
 to
 retire.
 And
 he


was
 just
 like
 I'm
 like
 what
 does
 that


mean?
 like
 what
 what
 do
 you
 need?
 Cuz


they
 won't
 ever
 ask
 for
 anything.
 Like


they
 won't
 even
 let
 me
 take
 over
 the


[ __ ]
 phone
 bill.


>> You
 still
 on
 the
 family
 plan?


>> I'm
 still
 on
 the
 family
 plan.
 And
 I


still
 send
 my
 it's
 like
 my
 mom
 finally


as
 I
 think
 she
 kind
 of
 forgot
 and
 I
 hope


she
 don't
 listen
 to
 this
 and
 I
 hope
 it


doesn't
 remind
 me.
 Don't
 send
 her
 this


part.
 And
 I'm
 like
 I'm
 33.
 I've
 played


in
 this
 year
 10
 years.
 Like
 I
 can


[ __ ]
 afford
 the


>> something.
 Um
 and
 it
 was
 like
 the
 first


time
 he's
 ever
 been
 like
 I
 just
 want


your
 mom
 to
 retire
 and
 like


>> be
 good.
 So
 this
 is
 what
 she
 needs.
 I


was
 like
 okay
 I
 can
 do
 that.
 I'm
 like,


"What
 do
 you
 need?"
 And
 he
 like
 starts


tearing
 up.
 I'm
 like, "Don't
 [ __ ]
 cry


cuz
 I'm
 going
 to
 [ __ ]
 cry."
 He's


like, "I
 don't
 need
 anything.
 I
 just


want
 your
 mom
 taken
 care
 of."
 I'm
 like


I'm
 like,
 "I'm
 going
 to
 cry
 now."
 I'm


like,
 "Man,


you
 have
 given
 me
 a
 life
 that


I
 couldn't
 even
 dreamed
 of.


You
 took
 me
 in
 as
 your
 own
 when
 you


didn't
 have
 to."


And
 I
 think
 navigating
 a
 world
 full
 of


men
 that
 aren't
 of
 quality,


it
 shows
 how
 rare
 he
 is.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so,
 like,
 I
 do
 want
 to
 take
 care
 of


him,
 too.
 I
 do
 want
 to
 take
 care
 of
 my


parents
 so
 much,
 and
 I
 think
 every
 kid


should.
 I
 want
 them
 to
 have
 experiences


that
 we
 never
 had
 as
 kids
 because
 we


couldn't
 afford
 to.
 Um,
 and
 that
 I
 can


give
 them
 now.
 And
 even
 for
 my
 parents


to
 still
 be
 so
 proud
 and
 not
 want
 to


take
 from
 their
 kids.
 I
 think
 it's


really
 rare.
 And
 especially
 in
 our


profession
 too,
 you
 have
 you
 have


families
 that
 bleed
 people
 out
 of
 their


contracts.
 You
 have
 you
 have
 families


that
 just
 take
 advantage
 of
 players
 and


and
 use
 them
 as
 like
 a
 cash
 cow.
 My


family
 has
 never
 taken
 anything
 from
 me.


I
 truly
 have
 um
 the
 best
 parents
 in
 the


world.


Even
 my
 siblings
 that
 vote
 for
 [ __ ]


Trump,
 like
 y'all
 irritate
 my
 [ __ ]


ass.
 But
 I
 know
 that
 if
 I
 ever
 needed
 to


be
 defended
 or
 they
 needed
 to
 step
 in


for
 me,
 they
 would.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


what
 come
 what
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 is
 just


like
 everything
 that
 I
 do
 is
 rooted
 in


love


>> because
 everything
 that
 I've
 ever
 known


has
 been
 rooted
 in
 love.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[Laughter]


[Music]


[Music]


You
 learn
 this,
 you
 learn
 the
 name,


let's
 say,
 of
 your
 sperm
 donor,
 as
 you


call
 him,
 at
 18.


>> Yes.


>> Um,


>> which
 is
 such
 a
 intense
 time
 because


you're
 going
 off
 to
 college.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 wonder
 like
 once
 you
 got
 to


college,
 were
 you
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 I


need
 to
 make
 black
 friends."
 Like
 how


were
 you
 thinking
 about
 your
 identity
 as


you
 moved
 on
 to
 that?


>> Yeah.
 Cuz
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 something


that
 I
 didn't
 touch
 on
 is
 like
 as
 I
 was


getting
 older,
 I
 think
 I
 was
 starting
 to


not
 struggle
 with,
 but
 I
 wanted
 to
 know


like
 I
 wasn't
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 a
 white


family.
 I
 went
 to
 all
 like
 really
 good


schools,
 but
 predominantly
 white
 schools


um
 in
 a
 predominantly
 white
 area.
 So,
 I


wasn't
 really
 I
 didn't
 get
 to
 experience


what
 my
 blackness
 meant.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so,
 uh,
 my
 first
 college
 was


University
 of
 Maryland.


>> And
 when
 I
 tell
 you
 I
 the
 thing
 that
 I


love
 most
 and
 still
 to
 this
 day
 about,


uh,
 UMD
 is
 the
 diversity
 that
 is
 on


campus.
 And
 I,
 as
 an
 18-year-old,
 just


like
 excited
 to
 get
 out
 of
 the
 house
 and


move
 a
 little
 bit
 away
 and
 to
 really


just
 dive
 into
 who
 is
 who
 is
 TSH,
 like


who
 am
 I?
 Um,
 it
 was
 the
 most
 amazing


thing
 to
 me
 as
 a
 young
 mixed
 girl
 to


finally
 just
 be


>> engulfed
 in
 such
 beautiful
 blackness.


And
 like


>> it
 wasn't
 even
 like
 my
 teammates
 that
 I


really
 hung
 out
 with.
 It
 was
 the
 track


girls.
 It
 was
 the
 football
 guys.
 It
 was


like
 the
 other
 teams
 around
 campus
 that


really
 just
 like,
 man,
 I'm
 indebted
 to


them
 and
 they
 don't
 even
 know
 it
 of
 like


how
 much
 they
 allowed
 me
 to
 find.


I
 I
 knew
 the
 white
 side.
 I
 didn't
 know


that
 black
 like
 side
 yet.
 I
 think
 before


I
 got
 to
 Maryland,
 I
 was
 like,
 I'm
 a


mixed
 kid.


>> Like
 I'm
 a
 mixed
 kid.
 That's
 who
 I
 am


and


>> that's
 who
 I
 identify
 with
 because
 I


didn't
 know
 the
 that
 other
 side.
 And
 so


when
 I
 finally
 had
 my
 blackness,
 like
 it


was
 the
 first
 time
 after
 that
 first
 year


at
 Maryland
 that
 I
 was
 like,
 I'm
 really


[ __ ]
 proud
 to
 be
 a
 black
 woman.
 I
 am


really
 [ __ ]
 proud
 to
 be
 a
 black


woman.
 And
 I
 still
 have
 to
 obviously


like
 that
 doesn't
 take
 any
 away
 from
 me


being
 proud
 to
 be
 mixed
 because
 I
 think


that's
 also
 important
 to
 who
 I
 am
 and


that's
 why
 I
 talk
 so
 much
 because
 I


might
 be
 biased,
 but
 I
 think
 being
 a


mixed
 kid
 and
 not
 fitting
 in
 with
 any


other
 group
 is
 one
 of
 the
 hardest


[ __ ]
 kids
 to
 be.
 And
 so
 I
 hope
 in


even
 me
 just
 talking
 about
 being
 mixed


that
 one
 mixed
 kid
 goes
 home
 and
 is
 like


I
 feel
 seen
 and
 I
 feel
 validated
 in


whatever
 questions
 I
 have,
 whatever


insecurities
 I
 have,
 whatever,
 I
 can


start
 to
 navigate
 this.
 And
 if
 I
 can
 get


one
 kid
 to
 do
 that,
 that's
 a
 ultimate


win
 for
 me.
 I
 mean,
 you
 spoke
 about
 this


somewhat,
 but
 as
 you
 grew
 more
 and
 more


into
 this
 identity,
 into
 this
 pride,
 as


you
 say,
 and
 then
 you
 go
 home
 for


Christmas,
 for
 Thanksgiving,
 for


whatever,


>> and
 you're
 back
 with
 your
 family
 who
 you


love
 who
 is
 white,


>> what
 was
 that
 like?
 Like,
 how
 did
 you


coming
 into
 your
 identity
 interact
 with


your
 family
 relationships?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it
 took
 them
 um
 just
 a


second
 to
 like,
 oh,
 this
 is
 Tash.
 like


this
 is
 new
 Tash
 that
 went
 off
 to


college
 that's
 an
 adult
 that's
 figuring


out
 and
 navigating
 her
 life
 and
 who
 she


is
 and
 um
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 times
 too


like
 I'm
 okay
 with
 being
 the
 crash
 out


in
 the
 family
 because
 my
 my
 crashes
 are


all
 validated


and
 and
 backed
 by
 facts


>> and
 truth
 and
 so
 like
 yeah
 I
 think
 I


came
 back
 like
 a
 little
 bit
 radical
 too.


My
 parents
 are
 like,
 and
 this
 is
 what
 I


love
 about
 my
 parents
 too
 and
 why
 I
 love


them
 down
 bad.
 Like
 even
 things
 that


they
 might
 not
 understand
 necessarily


understand
 as
 two
 white
 parents
 um
 they


meet
 me
 always.
 Um
 so
 like
 I
 really


appreciate
 my
 parents
 as
 two
 older
 white


people
 that
 um
 have
 been
 privileged


their
 whole
 entire
 lives.
 They
 literally


will
 allow
 themselves
 to
 hear
 me
 and
 to


move
 with
 me.


It
 means
 the
 world
 to
 me
 and
 I've
 said


that
 to
 him
 as
 of
 like
 late
 too
 of
 like


you
 know
 I
 really
 do
 appreciate
 that
 you


might
 not
 understand
 my
 walk
 of
 life
 but


you
 understand
 that
 I'm
 yours
 so
 it
 is


your
 job
 to
 walk
 this
 life
 with
 me
 and
 I


think
 that's
 really
 important
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 even
 kids
 to
 like
 it's
 an


underrated
 thing
 for
 me
 to
 go
 home
 and


even
 tell
 my
 family
 like
 I'm
 gay
 and
 not


have
 one
 person
 say
 [ __ ]
 about
 it.
 We're


talking
 about
 you
 coming
 into
 your


identity
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 your
 race.


>> Yeah.


>> You're
 also
 talking
 about
 coming
 out.


>> Oh,
 I
 was
 faking
 and
 mean
 straight
 for


years.
 It
 was
 so
 annoying.


>> It
 was
 so
 annoying.


>> Can
 you
 I
 mean,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 talk


about
 that,
 what
 does
 that
 mean?
 What


does
 that
 mean?
 So,
 it's
 like
 when
 you


were
 growing
 up,


>> you
 were
 like
 having
 crushes
 on
 boys
 or


what
 you
 were
 saying
 you
 did.


>> So,
 I
 still
 tell
 you
 this
 as
 a


33year-old,
 if
 a
 fine
 ass
 man
 walks
 by


this
 room,
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 like,
 he


fine.
 So,
 I
 can
 like
 I


>> appreciate
 it.
 I
 appreciate
 it,
 but
 all


the
 other
 [ __ ]
 that
 comes
 with
 y'all,
 I


do
 not
 I
 can't
 I
 can't.


>> But
 for
 a
 while


>> and
 I
 tried.
 I
 did.
 I
 really
 did
 try.


>> Did
 you
 um
 I
 mean
 it's
 it's
 funny
 cuz


these
 things
 sort
 of
 or
 maybe
 it's
 like


when
 you
 were
 young,
 did
 you
 like
 have


boyfriends?
 I
 mean,
 what
 was
 it?
 Okay.


Yeah,


>> y'all.
 I
 didn't
 start
 messing
 with
 uh


women
 until
 I
 was
 like
 23,
 24.


>> And
 so
 up
 until
 that
 point,
 no,
 I
 was


only
 with
 men.
 I
 I
 had
 like
 um
 this


childhood
 sweetheart
 for
 since
 sixth


grade
 till
 I
 would
 say
 freshman
 year
 of


like
 college.
 Like


>> we
 were
 that
 was
 my
 person
 and
 um


>> he
 sucked.
 No,
 I'm
 just
 playing.


>> We're
 act
 we're
 actually
 like
 still


really
 cool
 as
 a
 kid
 now
 and
 everything.


I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 we
 were
 we
 were
 best


friends
 when
 we
 were
 growing
 up
 and


stuff
 so
 like
 it
 just
 made
 sense.


>> Um


>> when
 did
 you
 realize
 you
 were
 queer
 or


interested?


>> I
 always
 thought
 women
 were
 beautiful.
 I


always
 would
 be
 like,
 "Oh,
 she's


absolutely
 like
 gorgeous."
 Or
 whatever.


I
 don't
 think
 that
 I
 I
 was
 ready
 to


navigate
 that
 space
 until
 I
 figured
 out


who
 I
 was
 as
 a
 human
 being


>> and
 to
 feel
 very
 secure
 in
 that
 to
 take


that
 step.
 Um,
 so
 when
 I
 got
 to
 the


league,
 and
 this
 is
 one
 thing
 that
 does


piss
 me
 off,
 this
 league
 don't
 turn


people
 gay.
 Like


>> there
 is
 I
 will
 say


>> like
 you
 don't
 turn
 people
 gay.
 It's
 in


you.
 It's
 innately
 in
 you.
 It
 it
 is
 in


you.
 So,
 um,
 when
 I
 got
 to
 this
 league,


it
 didn't
 turn
 me
 gay,
 but
 I
 was


surrounded
 by
 strong,
 powerful,
 badass,


independent,
 outspoken
 women
 that
 were


so
 unapologetic
 about
 who
 they
 were,
 how


they
 show
 up,
 what
 their
 families
 look


like.


>> And
 I
 was
 like,
 man,
 I
 feel
 empowered
 to


just
 be
 in
 this
 locker
 room
 and
 not
 be


judged.


>> Huh.


>> Yeah.
 I
 just


I
 I
 dived
 into
 it.
 I
 was
 like
 I
 was


like,
 "Oh
 [ __ ]
 I
 kind
 of
 like
 it
 over


here."
 And
 I
 was
 still
 playing
 that


middleman
 for
 like
 three
 years.


>> I
 was
 by
 publicly
 at
 least
 you
 were
 by


for
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Or
 said
 you
 were
 by.


>> And
 I
 said
 I
 was
 by
 and
 like
 I
 didn't


mean
 that
 [ __ ]
 when
 I
 said
 it.
 But
 what


people
 don't
 understand
 is
 for
 any
 mask


or
 gay
 person
 in
 our
 league
 or
 poppy


stud,
 whatever
 term
 terminology
 you
 want


to
 use
 for
 yourself,
 anyone
 that
 was


deemed
 different,


no
 sponsorship
 dollars,
 no
 endorsement


dollars
 because
 you
 can't
 sell
 to
 what?


The
 male
 demographic
 because
 they
 didn't


feel
 like
 we
 had
 enough
 sex
 appeal.
 So


for
 years,
 I
 played
 the,
 "Oh,
 I'm
 by
 I


still
 do
 both.
 I
 still
 do
 this
 knowing


damn
 right
 well
 that
 I
 wasn't
 ever
 going


to
 mess
 with
 a
 man
 again.


>> Now,
 how
 interesting
 is
 that?
 Because


you're
 saying


>> and
 it
 still
 happens
 to
 me.


>> Really?


>> It
 has
 gotten
 better
 over
 the
 last


probably
 like
 year
 or
 so.
 Obviously,
 the


stud
 buds
 weren't
 crazy.
 I
 created
 the


the
 poppy
 crops
 with
 Britney
 uh
 Sykes


like
 2
 three
 years
 ago.
 And
 finally,
 I


feel
 like
 our
 league
 is
 slowly
 starting


to
 see
 and
 not
 only
 the
 league,
 but


sponsorships,
 endorsements
 outside
 of


that
 is
 like
 there's
 a
 huge
 demographic


for
 them.


>> My
 god,
 have
 you
 been
 to
 Barlays
 when


you
 guys
 were
 playing?


>> How
 many
 straight
 women
 tell
 me
 they


would
 leave
 their
 And
 this
 is
 like


>> But
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 is
 like
 what


you're
 what
 you're
 pointing
 out
 is
 so


interesting
 because
 you're
 saying
 when


you
 were
 in
 the
 process
 of
 sort
 of


coming
 out
 to
 yourself
 to
 other
 people,


it's
 like
 in
 the
 locker
 room
 with
 the


teams,
 you
 felt
 completely
 at
 home,


seen,
 cared
 for.
 Yeah.


>> And
 then
 it's
 like
 so
 and
 that's
 because


of
 the
 experience
 of
 being
 in
 the


league.
 You're
 meeting
 these
 other
 gay


>> like
 pro
 mind
 your
 [ __ ]
 business


>> but
 then
 it's
 like
 from
 the
 outside
 you


can't
 it's
 this
 weird
 space
 you're
 in


where
 you
 can't
 you
 can
 express
 yourself


so
 fully
 with
 your
 teammates
 but
 then


because
 of
 the
 league
 because
 of


sponsorships
 and
 money
 and
 dollars
 you


can't
 do
 it.


>> When
 did
 it
 feel
 and
 how
 did
 it
 feel


more
 important
 to
 you
 to
 be
 true
 to


yourself


>> than
 it
 did
 like
 when
 were
 you
 ready
 to


risk
 that
 money
 or
 that
 sponsorship?
 I


would
 say
 probably
 like
 24.


>> Uh
 I
 just
 felt
 really
 rooted
 in
 myself.


Even
 when
 I
 came
 out,
 like
 my
 play
 got


better
 on
 the
 court.
 Like
 I
 was
 I
 was


torching
 people.
 It
 was
 almost
 like
 I


was
 like
 the
 Hulk
 that
 just
 got
 his
 like


superpowers.
 Right.


>> What do
 you
 think
 that
 was?
 I
 love
 that.


What
 do
 you
 think
 that
 was?


>> I
 think
 just
 like
 for
 me
 when
 you
 hide
 a


part
 of
 yourself
 or
 you
 suppress
 a
 part


of
 yourself,


>> you're
 not
 fully
 obviously
 yourself.


like


>> you're
 not
 fully
 you.
 And
 so
 you
 limit


yourself
 in
 so
 many
 ways.
 And
 I
 felt


like
 I
 was
 limiting
 myself
 for
 all
 those


years
 by
 not
 just


>> being
 out
 and
 confident
 in
 who
 I
 am.
 Cuz


if
 I
 can't
 even
 be
 confident
 in
 who
 I
 am


as
 a
 person,
 how
 the
 [ __ ]
 am
 I
 confident


in
 who
 I
 am
 as
 a
 player?


>> We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[Music]


[Music]


I'm
 this
 time
 where
 you're,
 you
 know,


publicly
 identifying
 as
 as
 as
 queer,


>> as
 gay
 as
 [ __ ]
 Gay
 as
 [ __ ]
 Okay,
 let's


just
 say
 that.
 Um,


>> I
 got
 called
 a
 Liberty
 lesbian
 last
 week


and
 I
 kind
 of
 loved
 it.


>> Wait,
 that's
 kind
 of
 that's
 kind
 of


nice.
 No,
 I
 loved
 it.


>> We
 loved
 that.
 It
 was
 in
 a
 good
 way.


>> How
 did
 you
 two,
 your
 girlfriend
 Izzy


Harrison,
 let's
 just
 say


>> we
 love
 her.
 Look
 her
 up.
 You
 going
 to


see
 I
 bagged
 a
 10
 out
 of
 10.
 100
 out
 of


10.
 Clock
 it.


>> Clock
 it.
 I
 mean,
 who
 made
 the
 first


move?


>> Isabelle.
 And
 I
 love
 telling
 this
 to


everyone.
 I
 love
 this
 is
 my
 moment.
 This


is
 my
 moment.
 This
 is
 my
 moment.
 And


she's
 going
 to
 kill
 me
 when
 I
 get
 home


and
 I
 love
 you,
 Isabelle.
 But
 this
 is
 my


moment
 to
 really
 just
 like
 flex.


>> Yeah.
 Every


>> But
 you
 DM'd
 her.


>> So
 I
 did,
 right?


>> She
 denied
 me
 hard.
 That
 was
 like


>> And
 you
 were
 like,
 "What's
 up?"


>> Yeah.
 She
 said
 no
 to
 me.
 And
 what
 did
 I


say?
 We
 respect
 a
 woman's
 no.


>> So
 after
 that,
 I'm
 straight
 friendship.


I
 might
 like
 I
 might
 have
 a
 little


flirtation
 in
 the
 mix,
 but
 it's
 never


it's
 never
 going
 to
 be
 where
 I
 make
 you


uncomfortable.


>> It's
 never
 going
 to
 be
 I
 I
 really
 took


that.
 No,
 it's
 like
 uh
 we
 can
 just
 be


friends,
 but
 I
 think
 you're
 my
 fine
 ass


friend.
 Like,
 that's
 for
 sure.


>> And
 I
 would
 love
 to
 kiss
 you.


>> I
 would
 love
 to
 kiss
 you
 and
 do
 all
 the


things
 with
 you,
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you


want
 to
 do
 that
 [ __ ]
 with
 me.


>> Wait,
 can
 I
 It's
 like
 So,
 she
 was
 giving


you
 these
 hints.
 Finally,
 like
 you
 took


it,
 but
 there
 was
 also
 a
 thing.
 actually


went
 to
 like
 a
 a
 massage
 and
 she
 was


just
 like,
 "Hey,
 like
 do
 you
 want
 to


hang
 out?"
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Yeah,
 like
 I


absolutely
 do
 after
 this."
 And
 from


there
 it
 was
 raps.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 this


is
 what
 you
 want.
 You
 want
 to
 hang


>> like
 a
 couple's
 massage?"


>> No,
 it
 was
 like
 we
 were
 just
 working
 out


so
 hard
 in
 the
 off
 season
 that,
 you


know,
 that's
 our
 form
 of
 self-care.
 So,


we
 had
 gone,


>> we
 had
 each
 had
 our
 own
 separate
 and


then
 we
 came
 out
 in
 the
 car
 and
 it
 was


like,
 "So,
 what
 you
 doing?"


>> Oh,


>> yeah.
 It
 was
 just
 like
 we
 both
 mustered


up
 the
 courage.
 I
 guess
 at
 that
 point
 I


just
 truly
 fell
 in
 love
 with
 the
 person.


I
 could
 have
 told
 you
 like
 3
 weeks
 in
 I


was
 like


>> you
 knew.


>> Yeah.


>> How
 and
 I
 always
 ask
 people
 this
 because


they
 really
 I
 I
 believe
 it
 that
 people


just
 know.
 How
 do
 you
 know?
 Was
 there
 a


moment
 was
 there
 another
 moment
 like
 you


look
 at
 each
 other
 in
 the
 car?


>> Our
 first
 conversation
 it
 was
 like
 us


getting
 to
 know
 each
 other.
 the
 first


time
 we've
 sat
 down
 oneonone
 and
 we
 led


into
 like
 an
 hour
 conversation
 of
 just


like
 our
 families,
 our
 foundation,
 our


morals,
 our
 values.


>> I
 was
 like,
 I
 really
 align
 with
 you
 as


as
 a
 human
 being
 and


>> I'll
 be
 honest
 about
 myself.
 I
 I
 think


in
 that
 moment
 I
 was
 like
 in
 my
 whole


phase
 and
 everyone
 has
 their
 whole
 phase


and
 I'm
 an
 advocate
 for
 the
 whole
 phase


because
 and
 don't
 like
 hurt
 people


throughout
 your
 whole
 phase,
 but
 like


you
 got
 to
 get
 all
 that
 stuff
 out
 your


system.


>> Totally
 agree.
 you
 got
 to
 get
 it
 out.


Whatever
 makes
 you
 happy
 in
 those


moments,
 you
 just
 got
 to
 be
 Sometimes


you
 got
 to
 be
 selfish
 in
 life
 to
 get


what
 you
 want.
 And
 so,


>> yeah,
 I
 was
 definitely
 in
 one
 of
 those,


but
 as
 soon
 as
 I
 met
 Izzy,
 it
 was
 like


everything
 stopped.
 Um,
 I
 feel
 fully


fulfilled.
 Uh,
 it's
 the
 first
 time
 I've


ever
 been
 fully
 reciprocated
 too
 in
 my


relationship
 of
 like
 having
 an
 equal


partner
 that
 doesn't
 need
 you
 but
 wants


you.
 Izzy
 has
 her
 own
 [ __ ]
 She
 has
 her


own
 money.
 She
 has
 her
 own
 like
 she's
 a


Jordan
 athlete.
 She's
 had
 nine
 years
 in


this
 league.
 She
 has
 her
 own
 she
 and


what
 I
 love
 about
 her
 most
 too
 is
 like


even
 when
 she
 was
 with
 men
 before
 me


didn't
 pay
 for
 anything


>> cuz
 you
 are
 the
 first
 woman
 that
 she's


been
 with.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so
 like
 I
 needed
 someone
 that
 I


couldn't
 play
 with.
 I
 needed
 someone


that
 was
 very
 much
 like
 my
 mom.
 And
 Izzy


is
 like
 damn
 near
 the
 reflection.
 You


know,
 they
 say
 like
 you
 really
 do
 look


for
 your
 parents
 and
 your
 partner.
 even


like
 home-cooked
 meals,
 uh,
 taking
 care


of
 everything
 that
 we
 need
 in
 order
 to


be
 successful.
 And
 I
 I
 bring
 that
 same


to
 the
 table,
 but
 Izzy
 is
 the
 first


woman
 that
 ever
 has
 done
 that
 for
 me,


too.


>> Sometimes
 you
 talk
 to
 people
 and
 you


just
 realize
 what
 you're
 looking
 for.


And
 but
 it's
 funny
 cuz
 you
 were
 like,
 I


need
 someone
 I
 couldn't
 play
 with.
 I


know
 what
 you
 meant,


>> but
 you
 do
 play
 with
 Izzy.
 You're
 on
 the


same
 team.


>> Yeah.
 Our
 first
 time.


>> This
 is
 an
 experience
 that
 very
 few


people
 work
 with
 their
 partners,
 I
 would


say.
 you
 know,
 very
 few
 people
 also
 play


on
 the
 same
 sort
 of
 sports
 team
 as
 their


runners.


>> And
 I'm
 so
 curious
 like


>> how
 does
 your
 relationship
 at
 home


influence
 your
 dynamic
 on
 the
 court?
 I


mean,
 I'm
 sure
 people
 have
 asked
 you


this,
 but
 I'm
 I'm
 so
 I
 want
 a
 window


into
 what
 that's
 like.


>> Yeah,
 we
 never
 tried
 to
 play
 together,


which
 is
 the
 crazy
 part.
 I
 was
 traded


and
 so
 she
 had
 already
 signed
 to
 New


York.
 Um,
 and
 we
 had
 made
 it
 a
 very,
 it


was
 a
 priority
 for
 us
 not
 to
 be
 on
 the


same
 team.
 So,
 you
 hear
 horror
 stories


sometimes
 of
 previous
 teams
 that
 have


had
 couples
 and
 relationships
 and
 how
 it


can
 negatively.
 Yeah.
 It
 can
 negatively


affect
 a
 locker
 room.
 It
 can
 negatively


affect
 the
 relationship
 itself
 because


you
 never
 get
 any
 breaks
 from
 each


other.
 Um,
 so
 I
 think
 me
 and
 Izzy
 were


very
 um,
 intentional
 about
 approaching


this
 the
 right
 way
 and
 being
 extremely


professional
 to
 no
 one
 would
 ever


>> We
 don't
 ever
 want
 to
 make
 people
 feel


like
 our
 relationship
 is
 hindering
 our


success
 as
 a
 team
 because
 the
 team
 is


the
 ultimate
 most
 important
 thing
 for


us.
 So,
 uh,
 we
 have
 our
 own
 separate


apartments.
 Now,
 Izzy
 stays
 our
 main


apartment
 is
 our
 apartment
 that
 we
 have


all
 of
 our
 dogs
 in.
 It's
 a
 two-bedroom.


is
 cool,
 but
 she
 has
 her
 own
 apartment


for
 when
 she
 just
 needed
 Izzy
 time.
 And


uh
 I'm
 clingy
 as
 [ __ ]
 I'm
 a
 golden


retriever.
 I
 am
 full.
 Like
 I
 call
 myself


a
 golden
 retriever,
 but
 I'm
 really
 a
 pit


bull.
 And
 for
 those
 of
 you
 that
 have
 I


have
 two.
 Uh
 for
 those
 of
 you
 that
 have


pitles
 know
 how
 [ __ ]
 clingy
 they
 are.


>> Yeah.
 And
 like
 attention
 demanding.
 That


is
 me.
 Izzy
 is
 polar
 opposite.
 She
 very


much
 is
 like
 and
 it's
 something
 that
 I


love
 about
 her
 is
 like
 I
 am
 still
 my
 own


person.
 And
 when
 you
 talk
 about
 even


like
 why
 I
 didn't
 like
 relationships


with
 men,
 that
 is
 such
 an
 important


piece
 for
 our
 relationship
 is
 for
 Izzy


to
 still
 be
 Izzy


>> is
 to
 still
 have
 her
 own
 [ __ ]
 to
 have


her
 own
 stuff.


>> Um,


>> but
 it
 is,
 you
 are
 saying
 something


which
 is
 like
 being
 on
 the
 same
 team,


it's
 made
 having
 your
 own
 space


>> that
 much
 more
 important.
 Um,
 we
 we


really
 were
 um
 a
 priority
 for
 us
 was
 our


teammates
 getting
 TSH
 and
 Izzy
 as


individuals.
 You're
 always
 going
 to
 get


your
 tizzy
 time.
 We're
 going
 to
 travel


as
 Tizzy.
 We're
 going
 to
 go
 into
 these


spaces
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 tizzy
 while


we're
 in
 these,
 you
 know,
 cities
 and


stuff
 like
 that.
 We
 have
 time
 for
 our


relationship.
 We
 go
 home
 together
 every


night.
 But
 when
 we're
 in
 the
 locker


room,
 you
 get
 TSH,
 you
 get
 Izzy.
 So,
 our


schedules
 are
 different.
 Our


weightlifting
 times
 are
 different,
 our


shooting
 times,
 our
 treatment
 times
 are


different.
 We're
 really
 like,
 we
 were


adamant
 about
 just
 being
 TSH
 and
 Izzy
 in


that
 locker
 room.
 And
 when
 we
 get
 home,


we'll
 be
 Tizzy.
 And
 it
 was
 it
 was
 hard


at
 first
 of
 like
 the
 first
 two
 weeks


>> diffult.
 Yeah.


>> The
 first
 two
 weeks
 of
 navigating
 what


does
 space
 look
 like
 for
 us?
 What
 does


it
 look
 like?
 How
 do
 we
 manage
 being


together
 all
 the
 time
 and
 not
 having
 a


break?
 Cuz
 most
 couples
 get
 a
 break
 when


they
 go
 to
 win.


>> I'm
 saying.
 Yeah.


>> And
 I'm
 so
 proud
 of
 us
 for
 how
 we
 were


able
 to
 go
 through
 this
 season.
 So


>> I
 do
 just
 wonder
 is
 it
 like
 totally
 hot


to
 see
 your
 girlfriend
 like
 kill
 it
 on


the
 court?
 Like
 what
 a
 turn
 on.
 Isn't


that
 is
 it


>> I
 tell
 her
 all
 the
 time.
 I'm
 like,
 I


actually
 I
 love
 Izzy
 in
 some
 basketball


gear.
 Like
 that
 is
 to
 me.
 And
 even
 like


meeting
 Izzy
 at
 first,
 I
 think
 she
 had


been
 so
 uh
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 ways
 like
 women


are
 uh
 conditioned
 to
 always
 look
 their


best
 and
 you
 got
 to
 show
 up.
 And
 I'll
 be


like,
 you
 don't
 need
 none
 of
 that


makeup.
 I
 love
 that
 you
 want
 it.
 I
 love


that
 you
 love
 makeup.
 I
 love
 that
 when


you
 do
 it,
 you
 100
 out
 of
 10.
 But
 like,


man,
 I
 think
 you're
 most
 beautiful
 when


you
 don't
 have
 no
 makeup
 on,
 when
 you're


wearing
 my
 clothes
 in
 the
 crib.
 Like


that
 is
 it.
 So
 when
 I
 see
 her
 on
 the


court,
 I
 absolutely
 am.
 There
 was
 like


one
 game
 the
 whole
 crowd
 started


chanting
 Izzy
 and
 I
 was
 like
 I
 was
 like


I'm
 beyond
 that
 [ __ ]
 All
 right.
 Not
 too


much.
 She
 going
 to
 kill
 me
 if
 I
 like
 if


I
 go
 too
 far
 with
 the
 sexual
 jokes.
 She


going
 to
 kill
 my
 my
 ass
 cuz
 she
 is
 very


reserved.
 So
 I'm
 real
 with
 myself.


>> But
 I
 understand
 what


>> but
 you
 know
 what
 I'm
 saying.
 Like
 I'm


going to
 yell
 that
 [ __ ]
 too.


>> I'll
 be
 like
 I'll
 be
 like
 you.
 That
 is


so
 hot.
 Here's
 my
 I
 want
 to
 figure
 out
 I


mean
 and
 this
 is
 you
 know
 you
 sit
 before


me.
 I
 watch
 you
 play.
 You
 strike
 me
 as


someone
 who
 is
 so
 who
 knows
 who
 they


are,
 right?


>> Man,
 I
 love
 myself.
 I
 think
 I've
 said


that
 for
 like
 two
 weeks
 ago
 for
 like
 the


first
 time
 like
 out
 loud
 and
 I
 remember


just
 sitting
 down
 in
 my
 apartment
 and


there's
 a
 little
 mirror
 that
 is
 like


right
 across
 and
 I
 looked
 at
 myself
 and


I
 was
 like,


I
 really
 [ __ ]
 with
 who
 I
 am.


>> You
 love
 yourself.


>> I
 love
 myself.
 I
 love
 myself
 very


thoroughly.
 I
 love
 my
 gay
 masculine


presenting


mixed
 black
 black.


I
 just
 love
 I
 love
 me.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Oh,
 thank
 you,
 too.


>> Thank
 you.
 And
 we're
 done.


>> We
 are
 done.


>> Wow.
