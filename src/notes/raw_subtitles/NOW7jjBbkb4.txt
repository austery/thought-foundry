In places like Indonesia,
the biggest source of carbon emissions
are actually coming
from the loss of our forest
and the burning of the peatland
that is this really carbon-rich ecosystem
that is made up of dead organic matter
accumulated over thousands of years.
Globally, the agriculture,
the forest and the land use sectors
actually contribute to around a fifth
of the global emissions,
which is significant, right?
So there's no viable pathway
for us to really mitigate climate change
without really stopping
the loss of our forests
and without actually starting to protect
this massive natural carbon sink
that is our peatland, our mangroves.
But what's causing the loss
of this critical ecosystem?
Well, it's actually the productions
of commodities that we use every day.
Things like timber or palm oil
that is so ubiquitous
that there's a good chance
when you walk to your local
supermarket stores,
almost all products in the shelves
have something to do with palm oil
one way or another.
But it also tells you that this product,
this commodity, is so prevalent,
it's so embedded in our daily life,
in our daily economy,
that completely taking out the production
and the consumption of it
might not be realistic at all.
And so companies
have recognized this dilemma,
and they've introduced policies
such as the no-deforestation policy.
And what it does is that it dictates them
to really make sure
that the palm oil that they're buying
is not contributing to forest loss.
Which is a good start.
But that's only one side of the coin.
The other side of the coin
is that if you really want to have
a nature-positive outcome out of this,
is that you have to start
proactively protecting the existing forest
and restoring those we have lost.
And here's the bad news.
Forest conservation financing
is massively underfunded.
The mitigation actions under
the agriculture, forest and land use
is severely underfunded
that it only receives
around less than four percent
of the total global climate financing.
And this is the problem
that we're trying to solve
with a mechanism
called the Rimba Collective.
So I have a political science background
as well as forest science background,
and I've spent a majority of my career
working with the governments,
companies in Southeast Asia
and civil society
to reduce the impact
of commodity supply chain.
And what Rimba Collective
mechanism allows us to do
is it lets the company to contribute funds
to protect and restore
the natural ecosystem
proportionate to their
raw material impact.
And in this case,
the more they use palm oil,
the more they have to contribute
to this Rimba Collective fund.
And it allows us to have this scalable,
large-scale, long-term financing.
But it also introduces this sense
of shared responsibility
and proportionate responsibility
across the supply chain.
And our aim is to be able
to deliver the conservations
of around half a million
hectares of forest
in Southeast Asia over the next 25 years,
while also providing local livelihood
for the communities that depend on it,
and preserving the habitats
of critically endangered species
in the forest area.
And Rimba Collective
is not just a concept.
So we've been doing this
for three years now,
and we're now actively financing
around 220,000 hectares of forest
in Southeast Asia.
But it is not without its challenge.
Finding a good investible forest
conservation project is challenging.
The first thing that you need
to do is to identify forests
that already have land management rights
at least over the next 20 years,
because we want to ensure
that any kind of interventions,
any kind of investments that we made
to protect the forests
can be sustained over the long term.
Second challenge is that some
of these forests are located
in a really remote location.
I happened to visit one of our projects
that is considered as accessible
in the western coast of Sumatra,
and it took me a two-hour flight
to get to the province
from the capital of Jakarta,
and then another 12 hours car ride
just to arrive to the village,
and then another full day's hike
just to reach the border of the projects.
Other projects might require us
to get on a boat,
a full day's boat ride,
just to arrive to the village.
Imagine finding good local organizations
or local company
who can deliver robust conservation,
who knows the landscape,
but also able to navigate a complex
international certification system.
Not many organizations can do that.
And so we have to build an ecosystem
of capable organizations
that can deliver these conservations.
Second challenge is on the demand side.
So when we're talking to companies
to invest in funds like Rimba Collective,
some of them are still thinking
that maybe protections
and the restorations of nature
[are] not our responsibility.
Or maybe they think
that conservation is cheap.
Putting five dollars
per hectare on the table
is enough to call it conservation.
Some of them might think that --
"I'm in it for the next three years
and then I'm out."
All of those are wildly,
wildly unrealistic.
Some of these projects,
they have to buy motorbikes.
They have to buy cars to patrol the area.
Some even have to build watchtowers
in the middle of nowhere.
Multiple watchtowers.
And some of our projects,
they need to build dams
to start regulating the water table
when they're restoring
the peatland ecosystem.
And of course,
all of that requires
significant amount of investment.
And so what's the ideal
way forward for us?
Well, first thing is that we need
to change the perception
that the protections and the restorations
of our natural ecosystem
should just be a charity project.
It shouldn't be.
The products that you use every day,
maybe the shampoo
that you used this morning,
might not reflect the true
environmental cost behind them.
The forests that were lost to grow
the ingredients that go in it,
or the carbon that was lost
and will not be absorbed in the future
because the trees are no longer there.
And so by linking these metrics
of procurement of raw commodities
directly to the conservation financing,
we should be able to recapture
that externality costs
and redirect that to the conservation
of our natural ecosystem.
And our goal is big.
Conserving and restoring 500,000 hectares
of forest is ambitious.
But that's just a fraction
of what we need to do right now.
Just to put things into perspective,
the World Resources
Institute, they estimated
that the amount of forest loss
that can be linked
to palm oil productions globally
is already at around six million
hectares of forest loss.
Cattle industry,
that's at a staggering
45 million hectares.
So again, 500,000 hectares sounds a lot.
And it is a lot, it is ambitious
given the amount of resources
that we need to mobilize,
but it should be seen
as a starting point of what is possible
if actors across the supply chain
work collectively,
and agree to finance the conservations
and the restorations
of our natural ecosystem
proportionate to their footprint.
The climate-regulating
function of a forest
is called an ecosystem services,
and I'm sure other services
that you have in your life,
you must be paying for that, right?
So our money,
your money should not just be paying
for the raw ingredients
that we use every day.
Our money should be able
to pay for the preservation
of the natural ecosystem
that we all depend on.
And what we want to do is to replicate
this across other supply chains.
So maybe we have Fashion Collective
or Rubber Collective.
And maybe only then we might have a chance
to close that financing gap
and have a real fighting chance
to address the climate crisis.
Thank you.
