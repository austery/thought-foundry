So
 in
 this
 part
 of
 the
 conversation
 I


want
 to
 talk
 about
 exercise,
 nutrition,


fasting,
 lifestyle,
 sleep,
 environmental


factors.
 And
 the
 first
 question
 is
 why


does
 muscle
 matter
 as
 a
 woman
 in


particular?


>> Muscle
 matters
 because
 it
 helps
 your


brain
 produce
 more
 neurons
 and
 that's


super
 important
 for
 brain
 health.
 As
 far


as
 protection
 as
 we
 age,
 it's
 directly


correlative
 to
 the
 amount
 of
 muscle
 that


we
 have.
 And
 if
 you
 have
 something
 like


PCOS
 or
 endometriosis,
 it's
 even
 more


important
 for
 you
 because
 building


muscle
 is
 going
 to
 fight
 insulin


resistance
 and
 inflammation.
 I've
 got


two
 questions
 to
 ask.
 Should
 women


exercise
 differently
 across
 the


menstrual
 cycle?
 And
 what
 is
 the
 reason


why
 women
 hear
 what
 you
 guys
 say
 and


they
 don't
 do
 it?


>> I'm
 so
 glad
 we're
 having
 this


conversation.
 We're
 back
 with
 the


leading
 voices
 in
 women's
 health
 to


unlock
 the
 specific
 insights,
 data,
 and


tools
 needed
 to
 combat
 the
 growing


challenges
 women
 face
 throughout
 their


lives.
 For
 women
 forever,
 it
 was
 all


about
 aesthetics.
 I'm
 healthy.
 I'm
 thin.


Because
 they
 are
 under
 the
 assumption


through
 socioultural
 ideas
 that
 a
 woman


is
 coming
 to
 the
 gym
 to
 lose
 weight,
 not


to
 get
 strong,
 not
 to
 gain
 muscle.
 But


what
 we've
 ended
 up
 with
 is
 an
 epidemic


of
 osteoporosis
 and
 frailty
 and
 really


dementia
 where
 40
 to
 50%
 of
 women
 will


have
 low
 bone
 density.
 70%
 of
 all
 hip


fractures
 happen
 in
 women.
 And
 when
 you


have
 that,
 30%
 of
 the
 time
 you
 have
 a


chance
 of
 dying
 in
 one
 year.


>> Because
 most
 of
 it
 is
 based
 on
 male


data.
 And
 I
 see
 a
 large
 number
 of
 women


trying
 their
 hardest
 to
 be
 healthy
 but


what
 they
 are
 choosing
 to
 do
 is
 actually


having
 a
 negative
 impact
 on
 their


hormonal
 health
 and
 it's
 not
 your
 fault


and
 this
 is
 where
 we
 have
 to
 educate
 and


it
 starts
 now.


>> Which
 brings
 me
 to
 questions
 from
 the


audience
 like
 what's
 the
 best
 and


healthiest
 way
 to
 lose
 weight?
 Is
 there


a
 diet
 for
 fertility?
 Should
 women
 ask


is
 there
 a
 link
 between
 environmental


toxins
 and
 early
 menopause?


>> We
 think
 so.
 But
 also,
 if
 you
 were
 to


design
 perfect
 workout
 regimes
 for


menopause
 and
 permenopause,
 what
 would


you
 Oh,
 Stacy's
 clapping.
 Go
 ahead.


This
 is
 part
 two
 of
 my
 conversation
 with


four
 of
 the
 world's
 leading
 experts
 in


women's
 health.
 And
 in
 this
 episode,
 we


go
 even
 deeper
 into
 actionable,


practical
 things
 you
 can
 do
 to
 improve


your
 health.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 if
 you're
 a


man
 and
 you've
 been
 sent
 this
 episode
 by


a
 girlfriend,
 a
 wife,
 a
 daughter,
 uh


whoever
 it
 might
 be,
 I
 know
 you
 might


not
 think
 this
 conversation
 is
 for
 you,


but
 more
 than
 50%
 of
 this
 planet
 are


women.
 You
 have
 a
 tremendous
 advantage


in
 your
 relationships,
 at
 work,
 and
 just


being
 a
 human
 being
 going
 through
 life.


If
 you
 understand
 the
 majority
 of
 the


population
 and
 for
 so
 long,
 women's


health,
 women's
 bodies,
 women's
 anatomy,


their
 psychology
 and
 physiology
 has
 been


a
 mystery
 because
 there
 hasn't
 been
 the


same
 amount
 of
 scientific
 research
 done


to
 understand
 them.
 So,
 in
 this


conversation,
 we're
 going
 to
 demystify


all
 of
 that
 so
 that
 you
 can
 understand


your
 wife,
 your
 partner,
 your
 daughter,


your
 colleague,
 your
 mother,
 your


grandmother
 even
 better.


[Music]


So
 in
 this
 part
 of
 the
 conversation,
 I


want
 to
 talk
 about
 exercise,
 nutrition,


fasting,
 lifestyle,
 sleep,
 environmental


factors,
 and
 all
 the
 things
 that
 we
 kind


of
 alluded
 to
 when
 we
 were
 referencing


hormones
 and
 menopause,
 but
 in
 a
 more


actionable
 sense.
 And
 I
 guess
 the
 first


question
 is
 similar
 to
 the
 first


question
 in
 part
 one,
 which
 is
 why
 does


it
 matter
 for
 us
 to
 have
 a
 conversation


about
 women
 in
 this
 context
 versus


fitness
 generally
 or
 nutrition


generally?
 Sport
 and
 exercise
 science
 in


itself
 is
 a
 small
 subset
 of
 like
 sports


medicine
 and
 medical
 research
 and
 most


of
 the
 research
 has
 been
 done
 on
 men.
 So


if
 we
 look
 inherently
 at
 most
 of
 the


recommendations
 of
 exercise,
 recovery,


nutrition,
 it's
 based
 on
 male
 data
 and


we
 established
 earlier
 that's
 not


generalizable.
 So
 when
 we
 really
 want
 to


get
 into
 the
 nuances
 of
 how
 do
 we
 create


an
 adaptive
 stress
 for
 women,
 we
 have
 to


look
 at
 it
 differently
 to
 look
 through


the
 female
 lens.
 understand
 the
 female


physiology
 and
 acutely
 how
 hormones
 can


affect
 adaptations
 and
 how
 women
 respond


to
 different
 environmental
 cues
 than


men.
 Yeah,
 our
 hormones
 distinctly


control
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 environment
 and
 the


b
 our
 other
 cells
 that
 are
 not
 what
 we


think
 of
 as
 our
 hormone
 cells
 work
 with


our
 hormones.
 So,
 if
 we
 think
 about
 the


gut,
 we
 think
 about
 the
 liver,
 our


immune
 system.
 A
 lot
 of
 this
 is
 so


hormonally
 derived,
 but
 it's
 a
 two-way


street.
 Meaning,
 your
 hormones
 influence


what
 is
 happening
 in
 your
 gut,
 but
 your


gut
 influences
 what
 is
 happening
 in
 your


hormones.
 And
 because
 women
 have


different
 hormones
 than
 men
 as
 far
 as


what's
 predominant
 and
 when
 they
 are,
 we


have
 to
 come
 at
 this
 and
 approach
 it
 a


different
 way.
 There's
 so
 much
 to
 do


with
 messaging
 that
 women
 receive
 as
 far


as
 their
 health
 goes.
 and
 this,
 you


know,
 be
 small
 at
 any
 cost,
 you
 know,


you
 know,
 get
 to
 that
 number
 on
 the


scale.
 And
 I
 see
 it
 on
 social
 media
 that


the
 conversation
 is
 changing
 hopefully.


Now,
 GOP
 ones
 is
 tampering
 this
 a
 little


bit,
 but
 strong
 over
 skinny,
 nutrition


over
 calories.
 Like
 we
 are
 trying
 to


build
 bigger,
 stronger
 bodies
 and
 take


up
 more
 space


is
 the
 message
 that
 needs
 to
 have.
 I


mean,
 forever
 it
 was
 all
 about


aesthetics.
 You
 have
 to
 look
 young,
 feel


young,
 be
 young,
 anti-age,
 you
 know,
 all


those
 things.
 And
 what
 we've
 ended
 up


with
 now
 is
 an
 epidemic
 of
 osteoporosis


and
 frailty
 and
 and
 really
 dementia.


>> Should
 women
 exercise
 differently
 across


the
 menstrual
 cycle.
 So
 this
 is
 the


nuance
 and
 this
 is
 something
 if
 you'd


asked
 me
 maybe
 5
 years
 ago
 I
 would
 have


said
 sure
 from
 a
 molecular
 level
 we
 see


that
 there
 are
 certain
 things
 that


happen
 with
 estrogen


being
 in
 isolation
 for
 the
 most
 part
 and


then
 when
 you
 have
 estrogen
 progesterone


we
 see
 their
 metabolic
 shifts
 we
 see


their
 temperature
 shifts
 but
 the
 caveat


is
 we
 don't
 know
 if
 a
 woman
 ovulates
 or


not
 and
 I'm
 sure
 that
 Natalie
 can
 you


know
 give
 some
 stats
 about
 the
 an


ovulatory
 incidences
 in
 most
 women
 if
 If


we
 were
 to
 understand
 and
 know
 when
 an


woman
 ovulates
 in
 addition
 to
 how
 she


feels
 across
 her
 cycle,
 then
 she
 can


individually
 tailor
 her
 menstrual
 cycle


to
 her
 training.
 But
 for
 general
 plan,


we
 can't
 do
 that.
 I
 think
 it's
 important


that
 you
 know
 building
 muscle,
 using


muscle,
 consistency
 is
 a
 huge
 part
 of


effectiveness
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 exercise


or
 to
 building
 strength.
 And
 so
 one
 fear


we
 have
 when
 we
 say
 do
 this
 in
 one
 phase


of
 your
 cycle
 and
 do
 that
 in
 another


phase
 is
 that
 if
 you
 know
 15%
 of


patients
 are
 not
 ovulating
 or
 they
 have


no
 idea
 when
 their
 follicular
 and
 ludial


phases
 are
 they
 then
 doing
 overall
 less


because
 they're
 waiting
 on
 this


directive
 to
 tell
 them
 what
 is
 not


untrue
 though
 and
 how
 I
 frame
 this
 to


patients
 is
 that
 strength
 and
 resistance


training
 should
 be
 the
 core
 of
 what


you're
 doing
 regardless
 of
 the
 phase
 of


the
 cycle
 you're
 in
 regardless
 if
 you're


pregnant
 regardless
 if
 we're
 doing


fertility
 treatments,
 building
 muscle,


using
 your
 muscle.
 Now,
 what
 you
 do
 on


other
 days
 is
 where
 you
 should
 allow


yourself
 to
 say,
 "How
 do
 I
 feel
 this


day?
 What
 do
 I
 need
 this
 day?"
 And
 be


okay
 with
 giving
 yourself
 the
 grace
 that


that
 may
 look
 different
 on
 your
 period,


in
 your
 follicular
 phase,
 in
 your
 ludial


phase,
 and
 saying
 something
 and
 moving


your
 body
 is
 still
 ultimately,
 we're
 all


going
 to
 agree,
 better
 than
 sitting
 on


the
 couch.
 Okay,
 many
 women
 will
 say


they
 have
 more
 energy
 in
 that
 late


follicular
 phase.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 are


looking
 at
 your
 workout
 structure,
 this


is
 a
 day
 I
 want
 to
 try
 heavier
 weights


or
 more
 reps,
 it
 can
 be
 smart
 to
 put


that
 in
 a
 time
 where
 you
 have
 a
 higher


chance
 of
 being
 successful.


>> That's
 how
 I
 explain
 it.
 I'm
 like,
 if


you
 have


>> your
 own
 data
 and
 you
 know
 what
 days
 you


feel
 really
 fantastic,
 that's
 where
 you


want
 to
 put
 your
 higher
 intensity,
 your


heavier
 lifting
 because
 you
 know
 that


you're
 going
 to
 hit
 those
 training


metrics.
 What
 we
 don't
 want
 is
 for


someone
 to
 go
 in
 to
 do
 a
 highintensity


session
 on
 days
 they
 feel
 flat
 cuz
 then


they
 won't
 hit
 the
 metrics
 that
 they


need
 to
 get
 the
 stimulus
 we're
 after.


>> Can
 you
 explain
 this
 to
 me
 like
 I'm
 a


10-year-old
 in
 terms
 of
 where
 in
 the


cycle
 typically
 women
 will
 have
 more


energy
 and
 really
 be
 able
 to
 push


themselves


>> right
 here
 5
 to
 7
 days
 before
 ovulation.


Some
 women
 feel
 really
 great
 around


ovulation.
 Some
 have
 a
 transient
 where


they'll
 feel
 really
 awful
 on
 and
 around


ovulation
 and
 maybe
 24
 hours
 later
 they


feel
 really
 fantastic.
 Most
 women
 are


variable
 through
 the
 early
 ludial
 phase.


So
 if
 we
 think
 about
 day
 6
 to
 14,
 that's


when
 we
 see
 women
 feel
 really
 robust
 and


strong
 and
 feel
 like
 they
 can
 take
 on


the
 world


>> because
 estrogen
 is
 rising.


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 And
 you
 see
 the


physiological
 changes,
 heart
 rate


variability,
 resting
 heart
 rate,


>> your
 immune
 system
 is
 um
 more
 prone
 to


taking
 on
 virus
 and
 bacteria.
 It's
 not


pro-inflammatory.
 So
 you
 have
 that


working
 for
 you.
 Your
 core
 temperature


is
 lower.


>> You
 can
 ask
 access
 um
 carbohydrate
 a
 lot


easier.
 So
 you
 have
 more
 availability


for
 fueling
 to
 hit
 high
 intensities.


Then
 when
 we
 see
 with
 ovulation,
 like
 I


said,
 some
 women
 feel
 really
 fantastic


right
 around
 the
 time
 of
 ovulation


because
 of
 the
 estrogen
 surge.
 Some
 have


trans
 transient
 where
 they
 don't
 feel
 so


great.
 They
 might


>> when
 that
 follicle
 ruptures
 and
 the
 egg


is
 released
 the
 granulosa
 cells
 that
 are


surrounding
 it
 which
 is
 what
 actually


makes
 estrogen
 get
 disrupted.
 And
 so


some
 women
 feel
 that
 transient
 breakage


and
 their
 estrogen's
 dropping
 before
 it


reforms
 to
 become
 the
 corpus
 ludium
 and


make
 again.
 So
 you
 have
 this
 high
 peak


estrogen
 and
 then
 some
 women
 are
 really


sensitive
 to
 these
 hormonal
 changes
 and


they
 feel
 that
 drop.
 So
 that
 ovulation


day
 may
 not
 always
 be
 your
 very
 best


feeling
 day,
 which
 makes
 women
 feel
 like


it
 should
 be
 and
 like
 something's
 wrong


with
 them.


>> On
 a
 side
 note,
 we
 did
 um
 survey
 on


women
 experiencing
 pain
 on
 ovulation


because
 it's
 something
 that
 was
 never


talked
 about.


>> Middle
 schmirts.


>> Yes,
 exactly.
 Middles.


>> Middles.


>> We
 had
 So
 you
 can
 feel
 the
 follicle


rupturing
 and
 that's
 called
 middle.
 So


it's
 German
 for
 in
 the
 middle
 because
 it


tends
 to
 happen
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 your


cycle
 when
 you
 ovulate.


>> And
 it's
 a
 it
 it's
 painful.


>> It's
 a
 pain.
 It
 can't
 be
 painful.


It's
 like
 a
 cyst
 bursting
 inside
 your


body.


>> And
 then
 some
 women
 are
 down
 for
 the


count
 because
 of
 it.
 So
 they
 can't
 they


don't
 plan
 any
 physical
 activity
 around


that
 because
 they
 just
 can't
 from
 a


physical
 and
 mental
 standpoint
 put


themselves
 through
 anything.
 So
 that's


why
 I'm
 saying
 like
 ovulation
 some
 women


feel
 bulletproof.
 Other
 women
 have
 this


transient
 feeling
 of
 really
 flatness
 and


pain.
 And
 then
 afterwards
 in
 these
 early


ludial
 phase,
 so
 day
 16
 to
 about
 day
 22,


it's
 variable.
 Well,
 some
 women
 will


feel
 like
 on
 top
 of
 the
 world
 still.


Other
 women
 will
 feel
 m
 I
 can't
 quite


hit
 eye
 intensities.
 And
 then
 in
 general


these
 few
 days
 about
 day
 24
 to
 27
 before


those
 hormones
 actually
 drop
 this
 is


where
 you
 have
 your
 PMS
 your


premenstrual
 syndrome
 and
 cramping
 and


fatigue
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 women
 are
 like
 not


so
 great.


>> That's
 when
 your
 progesterone


>> when
 both
 of
 them
 drop.
 I
 just
 love
 how


you
 guys
 explain
 it
 because
 what
 I
 see


on
 social
 media
 is
 absolutes.
 You
 must


do
 this
 doing
 ficular.
 You
 must
 do
 this


at
 ovulation.
 you
 must
 and
 I'm
 just
 like


really
 you
 know
 and
 so
 I
 love
 how
 you're


like
 well
 some
 women
 it
 may
 affect
 them


this
 way
 and
 others
 this
 we
 generally


tend
 to
 see
 xyz
 so
 rather
 than
 like
 you


absolutely
 have
 to
 do
 this
 at
 these


different
 times
 I
 think
 learning
 to


listen
 to
 your
 body
 and
 the
 signals
 that


it's
 giving
 you
 I
 mean
 across
 the
 stages


of
 your
 life
 that's
 that's
 really
 key
 to


so
 many
 of
 the
 questions
 that
 we're


talking
 about
 because
 you
 want
 to


understand
 your
 own
 response
 and
 where


many
 women
 are
 falling
 short
 is
 that


they've
 been
 suppressing
 their
 cycle,
 so


they
 don't
 know
 about
 it.
 And
 they
 were


not
 taught
 all
 of
 these
 different


changes
 that
 are
 perfectly
 normal.
 And


so
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 then
 hear
 a
 social


media
 post
 that
 says
 only
 do
 this
 in
 the


follicular
 phase
 and
 don't
 ever
 do


cardio
 in
 the
 ludial
 phase.
 And
 you
 get


a
 lot
 of
 mixed
 messages
 when
 in
 fact


there's
 no
 absolutes.


>> No.


>> And
 in
 terms
 of
 training,
 some
 people


think
 moderate
 training
 is
 better
 for


women.
 Some
 people
 think
 high
 intensity


training
 is
 better
 throughout
 the
 cycle.


and
 sort
 of
 also
 considering
 what
 goals


you
 might
 have
 in
 fertility.
 What
 would


you
 say
 there
 is
 is
 should
 I
 be
 doing


highintensity
 interval
 training
 if
 I'm
 a


woman
 or
 throughout
 the
 cycle
 and


throughout
 my
 life?


>> So
 this
 is
 where
 we
 have
 to
 think
 about


periodization
 first
 lifestyle
 but
 also


how
 a
 woman
 is
 feeling.
 We
 don't
 want


people
 to
 do
 highintensity
 interval


training
 every
 day
 because
 that's
 just


not
 going
 to
 create
 an
 adaptive


response.
 We
 have
 to
 think
 about
 the


reason
 why
 we're
 exercising
 is
 to
 create


a
 a
 stress
 that
 the
 body's
 going
 to


respond
 to.
 We
 don't
 get
 fitter
 during


exercise.
 We
 get
 fitter
 from
 the


stimulus
 of
 exercise
 and
 the
 recovery


from
 it.
 So,
 if
 someone's
 doing


highintensity
 interval
 training
 every


day
 or
 5
 days
 a
 week,
 they're
 not
 ever


going
 to
 get
 that
 subsequent
 recovery
 to


be
 able
 to
 hit
 those
 high
 intensities


and
 that
 stress
 that
 we
 want.
 We
 talk


about
 high
 intensity
 during
 our


reproductive
 years.
 you
 can
 pretty
 much


get
 away
 with
 whatever
 you
 want
 to
 do


during
 your
 rep
 reproductive
 years


because
 you
 have
 the
 benefit
 of
 our


hormones
 working
 for
 us.
 We
 start


getting
 into
 pmenopause
 and
 we
 start


getting
 into
 menopause.
 This
 is
 where
 we


have
 to
 really
 carefully
 look
 at
 volume


versus
 intensity.
 So
 that
 means
 if
 we're


doing
 lots
 of
 stuff
 or
 are
 we
 doing


really
 purposeful
 high
 intensity
 versus


low
 intensity
 because
 we're
 trying
 to


create
 what
 we
 call
 a
 polarization
 of


the
 training
 so
 that
 when
 we
 hit
 high


intensities
 we're
 actually
 hitting
 the


intensities
 we
 need
 to
 create
 change.


But
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 it
 we
 want
 to


hit
 really
 low
 intensity
 so
 that
 we
 can


have
 recovery.
 It
 gets
 harder
 to
 recover


as
 we
 get
 older
 regardless
 if
 you're


male
 or
 female.
 But
 in
 pmenopause,
 we


don't
 have
 the
 benefit
 of
 estrogen


supporting
 anti-inflammatory
 responses.


So
 we
 have
 to
 be
 very
 cognate
 that
 we


need
 more
 recovery.
 So
 I'll
 give
 you
 an


example.
 So
 my
 office,
 my
 orthopedic


office
 is
 in
 a
 fabulous
 performance


center.
 Outside
 my
 windows,
 I
 have
 floor


to
 ceiling
 windows.
 There's
 a
 football


field
 inside.
 That
 field
 is
 filled
 seven


days
 a
 week
 with
 people
 taking
 a
 class
 I


called
 Ignite.


Ignite
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 midlife
 women
 in
 it


who
 are
 never
 exercising
 at
 low
 enough


intensity
 to
 recover


and
 never
 exercising
 at
 peak
 intensity


to
 change
 their
 body.
 So
 what
 happens


five
 or
 seven
 days
 a
 week
 they're
 out


doing
 moderate
 mid-range


intensity
 training
 but
 they're
 not


seeing
 body
 changes.
 They're
 not
 seeing


recomposition.
 They're
 hurt
 every
 three


weeks
 and
 in
 my
 office
 wondering
 why


they're
 hurt
 because
 they're
 doing
 a
 lot


of
 reps
 of
 medium
 intensity.
 So,
 they're


not
 really
 recovering
 and
 they're
 not


intense
 enough
 to
 really
 change
 their


physiology.
 But
 that's
 really
 common.


There
 are
 whole
 brands
 built
 around


mid-intensity


and


>> and
 that
 falls
 into
 the
 whole


socioultural
 thing
 where
 we've
 grown
 up


that
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 good
 sweat
 sesh


and
 feel
 completely
 smashed
 when
 you


leave,
 it
 wasn't
 a
 good
 workout.
 But


that's
 a
 misconception,


>> right?
 So
 they
 are
 smashed.
 They're


dripping
 as
 sweat,
 but


>> it's
 not
 at
 peak
 heart
 rate
 ranges
 for


short
 bursts
 of
 time,
 right?
 So
 it's
 I


know.
 Look,
 it's
 very
 confusing
 because


I
 don't
 know
 20
 years
 people
 have
 as


they've
 switched
 from
 only
 cardio,


they're
 like
 now
 we're
 going to
 do
 high


intensity,
 which
 is
 fine.
 I'm
 not


opposed
 to
 that
 word.
 It's
 just
 that
 how


do
 you
 define
 that?
 What
 is
 high


intensity?
 And
 so
 like
 you,
 because
 I've


read
 your
 books,
 that
 we're
 we're


exercising
 people
 at
 pretty
 low
 heart


rate
 where
 they're
 about
 to
 flip
 from


burning
 fat
 to
 carbohydrates
 cuz
 that's


really
 metabolically
 healthy,
 but
 not
 so


intense
 that
 people
 are
 going
 to
 get


hurt.
 And
 I
 also
 prescribe
 really
 peak


sprint
 interval
 training.
 And
 I
 did
 that


myself
 in
 midlife,
 you
 know,
 to


recompose
 my
 body,
 sprint
 interval


training
 because
 it's
 intense
 and


lifting,
 right?


>> Is
 the
 advice
 different
 for
 different


women
 at
 different
 stages
 of
 life
 here?


So,
 if
 I'm
 if
 I'm
 before
 pmenopause,


>> you
 get
 away
 with
 most
 stuff.


>> Assuming
 you
 have
 a
 regular
 menstrual


cycle,
 right?
 I
 think
 there
 there's


different
 time
 periods
 which
 we've


mentioned
 before
 PCOS,
 hypothalamic


amenorhea,
 time
 periods
 where
 you're
 not


making
 estrogen
 or
 making
 it
 reliably,


you
 can
 get
 away
 with
 less.
 And
 so
 we


want
 to
 protect
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that.


But
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 exercise,


variety
 is
 the
 name
 of
 the
 game.
 You


want
 to
 adapt.
 So
 you
 shouldn't
 be
 doing


the
 same
 thing
 every
 day.
 That
 doesn't


mean
 you
 can't
 have
 a
 plan.
 There's


seven
 days
 in
 a
 week.
 You
 don't
 have
 to


move
 every
 single
 one.
 But
 you
 should


pick
 these
 different
 activities
 based
 on


your
 life,
 your
 schedule,
 what
 you
 want


to
 accomplish.
 And
 it
 it
 will
 vary
 some


in
 different
 phases
 of
 your
 life
 because


your
 goals
 are
 going
 to
 be
 different.


And
 so
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 exercise,
 we


always
 have
 to
 think
 about
 what
 needs
 to


happen.
 Are
 you
 somebody
 who
 is


overweight
 and
 needs
 to
 lose
 weight?
 Are


you
 somebody
 who's
 underweight
 and
 is


trying
 to
 gain
 weight?
 Are
 you
 trying
 to


get
 pregnant
 or
 going
 through
 fertility


treatments
 or
 in
 menopause?
 So
 there's


nuance
 to
 it
 which
 always
 makes
 it
 hard.


But
 there's
 not
 a
 one
 do
 this
 one


exercise
 every
 single
 day.
 That's
 pretty


much
 not
 the
 answer.


>> So
 the
 most
 popular
 class
 for
 females


right
 now,
 I
 just
 saw
 the
 statistic


somewhere
 is
 Pilates.
 And
 my
 daughter


loves
 her
 lree
 and
 gets
 on
 that
 machine.


It's
 like,
 you
 know,


>> where
 does
 that
 fall
 in
 all
 of
 this?


>> I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 um
 Pilates.


>> There's
 a
 social
 aspect
 to
 it.
 You
 know,


there's
 people
 hate.


>> Yeah.
 because
 um
 we
 did
 this
 real


talking
 about
 how
 Pilates
 was
 not


appropriate
 as
 strength
 training,


especially
 as
 a
 rehab.
 When
 we
 look
 at


Pilates,
 it's
 a
 complement
 to
 true


strength
 training.
 What
 I
 mean
 by
 true


strength
 training
 is
 you're
 lifting
 a


load
 that's
 heavy
 in
 multiple
 planes.


With
 Pilates,
 it's
 really
 good
 for


isometric
 control,
 core
 strength,


balance,
 propriception,
 but
 it
 isn't
 a


stress
 that's
 going
 to
 create
 adequate


muscle
 gain
 and
 strength
 of
 the
 bone,


which
 is
 what
 we
 want
 from
 strength


training.
 So,
 just
 like
 yoga,
 Pilates


has
 a
 place.
 It
 does
 definitely
 fit
 in


the
 scheme
 of
 things,
 especially
 from


the
 social
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 does


give
 you
 control
 and
 propriception,
 but


it
 isn't
 the
 beall
 end
 all
 for
 strength.


people
 that
 do
 pilateses
 frequently
 will


be
 shouting.


>> But
 I'm
 see
 it's
 so
 it
 hurts
 so
 much
 and


>> I
 know
 I
 hear


>> well
 I'm
 sure
 it's
 hard
 the
 times
 I've


done
 it
 it's
 not
 easy
 but
 the


>> but
 it
 doesn't
 uh
 set
 you
 up
 not
 to
 be


frail.


>> Mhm.


>> It
 is
 not
 building
 strength
 and
 power.


And
 I
 have
 women
 who
 have
 done
 so
 many


Pilates
 1500.
 It's
 like
 a
 badge
 of
 they


count
 their
 classes.


>> 1,500
 at
 the
 deficit
 of
 anything
 else.


It's
 all
 that
 goes
 on


>> and
 and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 another,
 you


know,
 you
 got
 to
 mix
 it
 up.
 Number
 one.


Number
 two,
 I
 say
 the
 same
 thing.
 So,


I'm
 not
 very
 popular
 in
 those
 crowds,


but
 it's
 great
 for
 the
 for
 the
 standard


that
 I
 ask
 people
 do
 of
 of
 flexibility


and
 joint
 range
 of
 motion
 so
 that
 you


don't
 become
 really
 stiff
 and
 hunched


over
 and
 shuffling
 old
 person,
 but
 it


will
 never
 give
 you
 strength
 and
 power


in
 the
 way
 to
 protect
 yourself
 from


falling
 down


>> because
 there's
 not
 enough
 weight


>> for
 the
 most
 part.
 Yes.
 And
 we
 also
 have


to
 think
 about
 when
 you're
 doing


strength
 training,
 you
 are
 in
 uh
 you're


creating
 a
 multidirectional
 force


through
 the
 muscle
 and
 the
 tendons
 and


the
 bones.
 With
 Pilates,
 especially
 if


you're
 looking
 at
 the
 reformer,
 it's
 not


multi-directional
 in
 the
 movements.
 It


each
 movement
 is
 one
 plane
 and
 you
 can


be


>> yeah,
 you
 can
 be
 in
 in
 different
 planes,


but
 each
 motion
 isn't
 multiplaner.


>> So
 if
 we
 think
 about
 what
 are
 we
 trying


to
 get
 out
 of
 out
 of
 Pilates,
 we're


getting
 neuromuscular
 control.
 We're


getting
 core
 strength,
 we're
 getting


some
 breath
 work,
 and
 all
 that
 is


beneficial.
 But
 again,
 if
 we're
 trying


to
 grow
 muscle
 and
 bone,
 take
 up
 space,


be
 strong,
 it
 doesn't
 quite
 hit
 the


points
 that
 we
 need
 to
 in
 order
 to


create
 this
 new
 strength
 to
 bring
 us
 to


that
 health
 span
 that
 women
 are
 looking


for.


>> So
 do
 it
 a
 couple
 times
 a
 week.


>> Yeah.


>> Not
 seven
 days
 a
 week.
 Correct.


>> So
 if
 my
 my
 partner,
 she's
 33
 years
 old,


so
 she's
 not
 quite
 at
 per
 menopause
 yet.


If
 you
 were
 to
 design
 a
 perfect
 workout


regime
 for
 her
 at
 that
 phase
 of
 her


life,
 what
 would
 you
 Oh,
 Stacy's


clapping,


>> you
 know.
 Go
 ahead.


>> So,
 if
 she
 has
 three
 days
 that
 she
 can


go
 to
 the
 gym
 and
 has,
 oh,
 I
 should
 say


three
 1-hour
 sessions
 that
 she
 could


have
 at
 the
 gym
 in
 a
 week
 over
 seven


days.
 Each
 one
 would
 start
 with


mobilization.
 So
 using
 resistance
 bands


or
 maybe
 you're
 doing
 a
 Pilates
 reformer


warm-up
 so
 you're
 getting
 through
 the


range
 of
 motion.


>> Why?


>> Just
 to
 open
 up
 the
 joint
 capsules,
 make


sure
 you
 don't
 have
 any
 restriction
 so


that
 you
 can
 get
 really
 good
 range
 of


motion
 for
 the
 movements
 you're
 going
 to


do
 next.


>> The
 next
 movements
 would
 be


>> does
 that
 stuff
 actually
 work?
 I
 do


wonder
 this.
 So
 many
 of
 my
 friends
 are


getting
 injured
 at
 this
 age
 because
 that


they're
 my
 age
 and
 a
 bit
 older
 because


they
 walk
 into
 the
 gym
 and
 they
 start


picking
 weights
 up.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 No,
 I
 mean
 I
 spend
 more
 time


mobilizing,
 I
 think,
 than
 I
 do
 actually


training
 now,


>> just
 to
 keep
 range
 of
 motion
 going
 and


keep
 the
 joint
 capsules
 open.
 And
 so


that's
 using
 the
 heavy
 resistance
 bands


to
 distend
 and
 distract
 all
 the
 joint


capsules
 to
 increase
 range
 of
 motion.


>> Stretching
 doesn't
 do
 that.
 Stretching


will
 get
 to
 an
 end
 point
 of
 the
 muscle


to
 allow
 you
 to
 have
 more
 flex
 in
 the


muscle,
 but
 it's
 not
 actually
 stretching


in
 the
 joint
 capsule
 to
 give
 you
 range


of
 motion.
 So
 when
 we
 talk
 about


mobility
 work,
 we
 want
 to
 get
 into
 that


full
 range
 of
 motion.
 So
 if
 you
 have
 a


stiffening,
 so
 as
 I
 was
 saying
 earlier


about
 the
 guy
 and
 my
 voodoo
 flossing,


well
 voodoo
 floss
 is
 a
 way
 where
 you're


creating
 some
 blood
 flow
 restriction,


then
 you
 go
 in
 a
 range
 of
 motion
 and


that
 blood
 flow
 restriction,
 you
 take


the
 voodoo
 band
 off
 and
 the
 blood
 flow


comes
 back
 and
 you
 go
 in
 the
 range
 of


motion
 get
 deeper
 in
 that
 range
 of


motion.
 So,
 it's
 all
 about
 accessing
 the


tissues
 and
 making
 the
 tissues
 more


viable
 for
 increased
 range
 of
 motion
 so


that
 when
 you
 go
 do
 the
 lifting,
 when


you
 go
 put
 on
 a
 heavier
 load,
 you
 have


better
 control,
 better
 range
 of
 motion


and
 avoid
 the
 small
 little
 sticky
 points


that
 cause
 injury.


>> Tears.
 The
 micro
 tears.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 so
 it's
 the
 micro
 tears
 that
 are


going
 to
 lead
 to
 in
 injury
 and
 the
 micro


tears
 come
 when
 I
 haven't
 warmed
 up


>> warmed
 up
 properly.
 Yeah.
 So,
 like


shoulder,
 what
 would
 that
 look
 like?


>> Or
 your
 shoulder.
 Uh
 I
 wish
 I
 had
 a
 rig.


So,
 you
 can
 take
 one
 of
 those
 thick
 um


the
 big
 and
 wrap
 it
 around
 a
 rig
 or
 or


something
 and
 you
 can
 pull
 and
 distend.


So,
 you're
 actually
 pulling
 the
 shoulder


out


>> in
 different
 ranges.
 So,
 you
 can
 rotate,


roll,
 pull,
 extend,
 pull,
 extend.


>> What
 about
 this?


>> So,
 this
 is
 more
 trying
 to
 work
 the


muscle,
 right?
 And
 you
 have
 paleo
 press


as
 well
 where
 you're
 working
 rotation,


but
 that's
 not
 getting
 into
 the
 joint.


>> So
 you
 want
 to
 be


>> So
 if
 you're
 distending,
 you're
 pulling


back.
 You're
 not
 bending
 your
 elbow.


You're
 actually
 pulling
 through
 the


shoulder
 and
 distracting.


And
 then
 the
 band
 is
 going
 to
 pull
 you


forward
 to
 give
 you
 resistance
 to
 pull


your
 shoulder
 joint
 out.
 And
 it's
 not
 a


painful,
 but
 you're
 just
 really
 getting


into
 that
 full
 joint
 capsule.
 You
 can
 do


that
 with
 the
 hips.
 You
 can
 do
 a
 banded


pigeon
 stretch.
 just
 so
 many
 different


ways
 of
 getting
 into
 the
 joint
 capsule,


which
 not
 only
 gives
 you
 more
 range
 of


motion
 and
 prevents
 injury,
 but
 it
 also


gives
 you
 more
 of
 the
 flexibility
 that


people
 think
 they
 get
 when
 they're


stretching.
 The
 reason
 this
 is
 important


as
 we
 age
 is
 because
 ligaments
 and


tendons
 and
 uh
 the
 capsule
 the
 inside


skin
 of
 a
 joint
 is
 made
 of
 collagen
 and


the
 covealent
 bonding
 collagen
 is
 like


if
 you
 envision
 strands
 of
 rope
 the


covealent
 bonding
 meaning
 the
 bonding


between
 those
 strands
 becomes
 stronger


as
 you
 age
 and
 you
 uh
 become
 more
 and


more
 stiff.
 Well,
 when
 we
 lose
 joint


range
 of
 motion,
 we're
 injured
 more.
 Um,


it's
 why
 we
 start
 shuffling
 down
 the


street,
 hunched
 over,
 shuffling
 instead


of
 striding
 because
 we
 have
 full
 hip


range
 of
 motion
 or
 full
 knee
 range
 of


motion.
 And
 so,
 one
 reason
 to
 do
 this
 is


to
 maintain
 full
 range
 of
 motion
 through


all
 of
 our
 joints.
 We
 want
 full
 range
 of


motion
 not
 only
 to
 avoid
 injury
 but
 for


instance
 if
 your
 knee
 is
 stiff
 whether


it's
 an
 injury
 or
 because
 you
 just


haven't
 maintained
 your
 motion
 it
 will


change
 something
 called
 your
 kinetic


chain
 meaning
 we
 really
 are
 from
 our
 big


toe
 to
 through
 our
 spine
 connected
 the


big
 toes
 connected
 to
 the
 footbone
 the


footbone
 because
 the
 way
 each
 of
 those


body
 segments
 works
 activates
 the
 next


body
 segment.
 So,
 if
 you've
 got
 a
 glitch


in
 the
 system
 because
 your
 knee
 doesn't


move
 or
 let's
 take
 this
 one,
 this
 is


easier.
 Your
 ankles
 get
 stiff
 because


we've
 never
 worked
 on
 it.
 Your
 calves


are
 tight,
 right?
 You're
 a
 jumper.


You've
 got
 tight
 calves.
 Your
 your
 hip


your
 ankle
 doesn't
 flex.
 Well,
 then
 your


shin
 bone
 or
 your
 tibia
 is
 not
 going
 to


internally
 rotate.
 Well,
 without
 that,


your
 knee
 is
 not
 going
 to
 bend
 as
 much


and
 your
 femur,
 your
 thigh
 bone
 is
 not


going
 to
 rotate.
 You
 must
 have
 the


rotation
 of
 these
 bones
 to
 activate
 your


glute.


>> So
 if
 you're
 not
 activating
 your
 glute,


your
 butt
 muscle,


people
 are
 very
 hurt
 or
 they're
 not


getting
 as
 strong
 or
 they
 start
 having


lateral
 thigh
 pain.
 So
 everything
 works


together
 and
 it
 starts
 with
 among
 other


things


the
 flexibility
 and
 range
 of
 motion


exercises.
 We're
 talking
 about
 it
 right


now.
 So
 that
 the
 body
 works
 like
 a


chain.


I
 see
 messages
 all
 the
 time
 in
 the


comments
 section
 that
 some
 of
 you
 didn't


realize
 you
 didn't
 subscribe.
 So,
 if
 you


could
 do
 me
 a
 favor
 and
 double
 check
 if


you're
 a
 subscriber
 to
 this
 channel,


that
 would
 be
 tremendously
 appreciated.


It's
 the
 simple,
 it's
 the
 free
 thing


that
 anybody
 that
 watches
 this
 show


frequently
 can
 do
 to
 help
 us
 here
 to


keep
 everything
 going
 in
 this
 show
 in


the
 trajectory
 it's
 on.
 So,
 please
 do


double
 check
 if
 you've
 subscribed
 and
 uh


thank
 you
 so
 much
 because
 in
 a
 strange


way,
 you
 are
 you're
 part
 of
 our
 history


and
 you're
 on
 this
 journey
 with
 us
 and
 I


appreciate
 you
 for
 that.
 So,
 yeah,
 thank


you.
 If
 I
 lose
 my
 range
 of
 motion


because
 I
 never
 did
 all
 these
 things,


can
 I
 get
 it
 back
 when
 I'm
 50?
 So,
 like,


you
 know,
 I'm
 33
 now
 and
 I'm
 think,


damn,
 I've
 not
 been
 doing
 enough
 of
 this


stuff.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 you
 can.
 Unless
 you're


having
 bone
 changes
 due
 to
 arthritis
 and


it's
 blocked.
 Yes,
 you
 can.


>> So,
 I
 can
 start
 I
 could
 theoretically


start
 at
 40


>> cuz
 if
 you
 think
 about
 your
 muscle
 and


how
 it
 responds
 to
 picking
 up
 a
 weight


and
 right,
 you're
 going
 to
 build
 the


muscle.
 So
 if
 you're
 creating
 a
 force


within
 the
 tendon
 and
 the
 ligament
 and


the
 collagen
 and
 it's
 a
 repetitive


force,
 a
 positive
 force,
 you're
 going
 to


invoke
 change.


>> Tissues
 are
 malleable.


>> So
 people
 that
 think
 they're
 stiff
 and


they
 say,
 you
 know,
 I
 can't
 touch
 my


toes
 and


>> they
 can
 work
 on


>> they
 can
 get
 it
 back.


>> Here's
 another
 reason.
 So
 what
 happens


in
 midlife
 men
 and
 women
 actually
 they


remember
 what
 they
 used
 to
 do


>> and
 then
 they're
 like
 I'm
 going
 to
 start


working
 out
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 start


>> their
 success.


>> This
 is
 when
 I
 get
 people
 who
 just
 show


up
 on
 the
 basketball
 court
 after
 not


having
 been
 there
 for
 quite
 some
 time


and
 they
 return
 to
 their
 memories
 of


success
 but
 because
 they
 haven't


lengthened
 their
 tendons,
 their
 joints


aren't
 moving
 quite
 so
 well.
 They


rupture
 tendons
 because
 the
 load


outstrips
 the
 ability
 of
 the
 tissue
 to


be
 compliant.


>> That
 makes
 sense.


>> Friends
 have
 been
 getting
 injured
 and
 I


think
 that's
 in
 part
 why
 because
 they're


trying
 to
 work
 out
 like
 they
 used
 to


work
 out.


>> Yeah.
 And
 listen,
 they
 can
 return
 to


really
 high
 level,
 but
 you
 can't
 stop.


You
 can't
 start
 where
 you
 left
 off
 20


years
 ago
 or
 10
 years
 ago.
 It
 takes
 a


minute.


>> Few
 weeks
 for
 me.


>> It
 takes
 a
 minute.
 Yeah.
 So
 Mel's
 33.


You


>> mobility
 work
 when
 she
 gets
 to
 the
 gym


first
 and
 foremost.


>> Y


>> on
 day
 one


>> or
 every
 day?


>> Every
 day.


>> Every
 day.
 So
 I'm
 assuming,
 and
 I
 could


be
 wrong,
 that
 she
 already
 has
 a


strength
 training
 history.


>> Yeah,
 she
 does.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 So
 we
 do
 the
 mo
 mobility
 work
 for


about
 10
 minutes.
 Really
 warm
 up.
 Well,


then
 we
 pick
 one
 compound
 movement
 we're


going
 to
 work
 on.
 So
 could
 be
 squats
 on


the
 Monday.
 So
 we're
 going
 to
 work
 on


loading
 in
 a
 squat
 pattern.
 So
 that's


your
 knee
 forward,
 you
 know,
 quad


dominant
 type
 squat
 motion.


>> Back
 squat,
 does
 it
 matter?


>> Back
 squat,
 front
 squat.
 You
 could
 do


Bulgarian
 split
 squats.
 So
 we're
 adding


load
 and
 we
 have
 a
 periodized
 program.


So
 this
 is
 just
 a
 snippet
 of
 one
 day
 in


a
 periodized
 program.


>> What
 if
 you
 didn't
 have
 that
 strength


training
 history?


>> Well,
 then
 we
 work
 on
 adding
 load


through
 our
 I
 want
 to
 see
 how
 she
 moves


first
 and
 we
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that


you're
 moving
 well
 before
 you
 add
 load.


So
 this
 is
 where
 we
 would
 work
 with


lighter
 loads
 and
 more
 reps.


>> What
 if
 she's
 doesn't
 have
 you
 there?


>> Yeah,
 that
 was
 my
 question.
 Like
 what
 if


you're
 not
 there
 on
 her
 own?


>> Yeah.
 So
 this
 is
 still
 like
 how
 do
 you


squat?
 Where
 are
 your
 sticking
 points?


So
 you
 can
 assess,
 self
 assess.
 If


you've
 done
 your
 mobility,
 then
 you'll


know
 like,
 oh,
 my
 hips
 really
 tight,
 so


I
 need
 to
 work
 on
 that.
 So
 let
 me
 do


some
 air
 squats
 to
 see
 how
 I
 move.
 Then


the
 next
 time
 you
 go
 in
 to
 do
 squats,


maybe
 you're
 picking
 up
 um
 two
 10
 pound


dumbbells
 and
 you're
 holding
 them
 and


doing
 air
 squats
 with
 your
 dumbbells.


And
 eventually
 you're
 gonna
 move
 to
 the


barbell.
 So
 it's
 all
 about
 small


progression
 under
 load
 to
 get
 to
 a
 point


where
 you
 feel
 more
 confident
 to
 use
 a


barbell
 back
 squat
 to
 get
 into
 more
 of


those
 compound
 movements.


>> Why
 don't
 people
 exercise?
 Specifically,


if
 we
 just
 focus
 here
 on
 women,
 what
 is


the
 reason
 why
 people
 hear
 what
 you
 guys


say
 when
 you're
 talking
 about
 exercise


and
 they
 don't
 do
 it?
 They
 don't
 start.


>> It's
 hard.


>> For
 what
 what
 set
 of
 reasons
 make
 it


hard?


>> Well,
 for
 women,
 it's
 set
 up
 in
 a


gendered
 environment.
 Like
 I
 always
 use


the
 example
 of
 a
 woman
 who
 has
 an


interest
 in
 strength
 training.
 if
 they


go
 to
 a
 typical
 like
 24-hour
 fitness
 or


another
 brand
 gym
 that's
 out
 there,


they'll
 walk
 in
 and
 they'll
 say,
 "Yep,
 I


want
 to
 join."
 And
 the
 membership
 person


most
 often
 will
 say,
 "Great.
 Here's
 the


class
 schedule.
 This
 is
 where
 we
 have


our
 spin
 classes.
 This
 is
 where
 we
 do


our
 our


classes."


>> They
 never
 direct
 them
 to
 the
 lifting


platforms.
 They
 never
 look
 and
 say,


"Hey,
 here
 are
 are
 the
 way
 to
 get


strong."
 Because
 they
 are
 under
 the


assumption
 through
 socioultural
 ideas


that
 a
 woman
 is
 coming
 to
 the
 gym
 to


lose
 weight,
 not
 to
 get
 strong,
 not
 to


gain
 muscle,


>> not
 to
 recomposition.
 Yeah.


>> Right.
 But
 if
 a
 man
 walks
 in,
 then
 it's


always
 the
 great,
 here's
 the
 lifting


platforms,
 we
 have
 x
 amount
 of
 barbells,


we
 have
 x
 amount
 of
 bumper
 plates.
 How


much
 weight
 do
 you
 want
 to
 gain?
 Do
 you


do
 you
 want
 to
 work
 with
 someone
 to,
 you


know,
 help
 you
 build
 that
 mass?


>> Vonda,
 why
 does
 it
 matter?


You
 know,
 cuz
 there's
 a
 big
 social


pressure
 on
 women
 to
 look
 a
 certain
 way


>> and
 it
 doesn't
 typically
 involve
 muscles


in
 the
 especially
 in
 the
 upper
 body.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 you
 know,
 we're
 still
 living
 under


the
 times
 of
 be
 as
 small
 as
 you
 can,


>> but
 small
 doesn't
 mean
 lean.
 There's
 a


concept
 of
 skinny
 fat
 which
 you
 know


it's
 you
 can
 be
 as
 tiny
 as
 tiny
 but
 you


can
 be
 50
 you
 can
 have
 a
 body
 fat
 of
 50%


which
 means
 you're
 neither
 strong
 you're


not
 metabolically
 healthy
 you're
 just


little
 right


>> so
 it's
 there
 is
 also
 a
 misconception


that
 lifting
 heavy
 is
 going
 to


automatically
 turn
 you
 into
 a
 physique


model
 or
 a
 bodybuilder
 shape


if
 that's
 your
 goal
 that's
 probably


going
 to
 take
 you
 five
 years
 or
 a


decade.
 It's
 a
 lot
 of
 hard
 work
 for
 a


long
 period
 of
 time
 with
 proper


nutrition.
 So
 for
 a
 woman
 who's


wants
 to
 feel
 better,
 the
 goal
 is
 to


build
 muscle
 to
 be
 lean,
 to
 recompose,


not
 lose
 weight,
 right?
 I'm
 not
 really


interested
 in
 somebody's
 weight.
 I'm


interested
 in
 their
 body
 fat
 percentage


and
 their
 lean
 muscle
 mass.


>> Um


because
 it's
 what
 you're
 made
 of
 that


matters,
 right?
 Not
 the
 size
 of
 the


shell.


>> And
 why
 does
 muscle
 matter
 as
 I
 age?
 As


a
 woman
 in
 particular,


>> it
 matters
 for
 everyone,
 but
 for
 uh


muscle
 matters
 because
 it's
 not
 just


part
 of
 locomotion.
 It's
 not
 just
 part


of
 moving
 you
 around.
 It
 is
 a
 metabolic


organ.
 It
 is
 critical
 for
 glucose


metabolism.
 It's
 critical
 for
 uh
 insulin


sensitivity.
 It
 uh
 talks
 to
 the
 bone.


Bone
 and
 bone
 and
 muscle
 are
 endocrine


organs
 which
 cross
 communicate
 all
 the


time.
 So
 both
 bone
 and
 muscle
 have


access
 to
 the
 brain.
 Right?
 Uh
 muscle


will
 produce
 a
 hormone
 called
 irri
 which


has
 multiple
 functions
 in
 the
 body.


The
 the
 axis
 between
 muscle
 and
 brain


helps
 your
 brain
 produce
 more
 neurons.


Right?
 bones
 access
 to
 the
 brain
 has
 a


role
 in
 satiety.
 Isn't
 that
 amazing?


Which
 means
 not
 hungry
 anymore.
 Why


would
 you
 think
 these
 locomotive


structures,
 if
 that's
 what
 you
 limit


them
 to,
 would
 would
 even
 have
 those


functions?
 It's
 because
 we
 put
 organs
 in


a
 box.
 So
 to
 answer
 your
 question,


muscle
 in
 men
 and
 women,
 but
 women
 in


particular
 for
 this
 conversation,
 we


need
 as
 much
 muscle
 as
 possible
 to
 fight


the
 insulin
 resistance
 that
 we
 get
 when


estrogen
 walks
 out
 the
 door.
 We
 need
 uh


muscle
 for
 glucose
 metabolism.
 We
 need


muscle
 for
 the
 pure
 strength
 of
 it


because


we
 do
 not
 want
 to
 become
 frail
 and
 be


one
 of
 the
 twothirds
 of
 nursing
 home


residents
 who
 are
 women
 because
 we
 can't


do
 something
 as
 simple
 as
 get
 up
 out
 of


a
 chair.


>> But
 I
 could
 just
 get
 muscle
 when
 I'm
 70.


>> You
 can
 actually
 harder.


>> So
 why
 does
 it
 matter
 for
 Mel
 to
 be


thinking
 about
 it
 when
 she's
 33?


>> Well,
 here's
 the
 great
 part
 for
 Mel
 is


she
 still
 has
 all
 her
 estrogen.
 Mhm.


>> Estrogen
 has
 a
 profound
 effect
 on
 muscle


protein
 synthesis.
 Um
 it
 is
 a


significant
 anti-inflammatory.


So
 high
 inflammation,
 chronic


inflammation,
 we've
 talked
 about


decreases
 muscle
 synthesis.
 It
 decreases


bone
 synthesis
 because
 inflammation
 with


its
 high
 cytoine
 level
 I've
 mentioned


them
 before
 IL6
 tumor
 crosis
 factor


those
 are
 all
 detrimental
 to
 these


normal
 metabolic
 pathways.
 So
 the


wonderful
 thing
 for
 Mel
 who
 is
 entering


what
 I
 call
 the
 critical
 decade
 which
 is


35
 to
 45
 estimated.
 It's
 the
 prime
 time


to
 set
 your
 physical
 activity
 standards


and
 to
 build
 as
 much
 as
 you
 can
 while


you
 still
 got
 all
 your
 estrogen.


>> In
 addition
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 for
 proper


hormonal
 health,
 you
 think
 about


inflammation
 coming
 in,
 it's
 like
 static


on
 a
 walkie-talkie.
 The
 brain's
 trying


to
 interpret
 your
 hormones
 and
 when


inflammation's
 coming
 in,
 it's
 making


the
 signals
 really
 hard
 to
 hear.
 So,
 we


need
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we're
 actively


fighting
 that.
 And
 building
 muscle
 is


one
 great
 way
 because
 it's
 going
 to
 use


up
 glucose
 and
 fight
 insulin
 resistance,


which
 means
 makes
 your
 cells
 more


sensitive
 to
 when
 it
 sees
 glucose
 and


able
 to
 use
 it
 better.
 If
 you
 have


another
 thing
 that
 is
 pro-inflammatory


such
 as
 PCOS
 or
 endometriosis,


it's
 even
 more
 important
 for
 you
 because


your
 inflammatory
 burden
 by
 default
 of


what's
 happening
 at
 a
 cellular
 level
 is


higher.
 We
 now
 need
 to
 not
 just
 say,
 I


need
 to
 not
 make
 it
 worse
 by
 being


exposed
 to
 things.
 We
 have
 to
 say,
 I


need
 a
 plan
 to
 fight
 this
 because
 my


world
 is
 pro-inflammatory
 on
 a
 daily


basis.
 What
 is
 my
 game
 plan
 to
 fight


this?
 And
 building
 muscle.
 It's
 not
 just


exercise
 is
 better
 than
 no
 exercise
 but


specifically
 building
 muscle
 because
 as


everybody's
 saying
 it's
 has
 a
 metabolic


function
 in
 your
 body
 is
 going
 to
 help


you
 the
 most.
 There's
 a
 term
 called


geroprotective
 geroproction.
 So
 gerero


is
 is
 the
 term
 we
 use
 for
 aging.
 So


gerontology
 is
 the
 you
 know
 the
 part
 of


medicine
 that
 focuses
 on
 the
 elderly


patients.
 And
 so
 when
 we
 look
 on
 in


females
 and
 the
 organs
 that
 are,
 you


know,
 are
 the
 most
 ger
 protective,
 it
 is


the
 muscle
 and
 the
 ovary
 and
 the
 ovaries


go
 away.
 We
 have
 a
 shelf
 life
 in
 our


ovaries.
 So
 then
 we're
 just
 really
 left


with
 our
 muscle
 as
 far
 as
 protecting
 us


in
 those
 elderly
 years
 as
 we
 age.
 And


it's
 directly
 correlative
 to
 the
 amount


of
 muscle
 that
 we
 have
 because
 if
 you


have
 a
 lot
 of
 muscle,
 you're
 going
 to


have
 stronger
 bones.


And
 this
 this
 is
 where
 the
 intensity


part
 where
 um
 Dr.
 I
 was
 talking
 about


seeing
 the
 ignite
 class
 and
 everyone's


in
 that
 moderate
 intensity
 all
 the
 time.


With
 moderate
 intensity,
 you
 don't
 have


the
 post
 exercise
 anti-inflammatory


response.
 So,
 if
 we're
 trying
 to
 build


muscle
 and
 we're
 trying
 to
 dampen


inflammation
 if
 we're
 always
 doing
 this


moderate
 intensity
 cardio,
 then
 we're


not
 one
 going
 to
 be
 building
 the
 muscle


we
 want
 and
 two
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 this


baseline
 elevation
 of
 total
 body


inflammation.
 So
 we
 need
 to
 mix
 it
 up


and
 have
 that
 precedence
 on
 being
 muscle


centric
 and
 building
 that
 muscle


>> one
 to
 help
 with
 aesthetics.
 I
 mean


that's
 the
 byproduct
 of
 lifting
 weights.


You
 tend
 to
 look
 better
 but
 it's
 more


than
 that.
 We
 see
 it
 improves
 brain


health
 because
 of
 the
 neuro
 connections


and
 the
 neuroplasticity
 of
 the
 brain
 and


I
 told


>> sleep
 all
 of
 those
 things
 you
 get
 an


incredible
 parasympathetic
 response
 when


you've
 done
 a
 significant
 heavy
 lifting


session
 or
 a
 sprint
 interval
 session


which
 you
 don't
 get
 with
 that
 moderate


intensity
 cardiovascular
 work.


>> Two
 questions
 to
 add
 to
 what
 you
 you're


about
 to
 say
 here
 is
 um
 am
 I
 right
 in


thinking
 that


>> at
 the
 end
 of
 that
 golden
 decade
 that


you
 referenced
 45
 years
 old


Because
 you
 have
 changes
 in
 estrogen,


one
 will
 expect
 to
 see
 a
 a
 natural


decline
 in
 muscle.


>> Yes.


>> Um
 and
 an
 increased
 chance
 of


osteoporosis,
 osteopenia,
 bone
 issues


later
 in
 life?
 Do
 women,
 this
 is
 several


questions,
 I
 apologize,
 but
 do
 women


then
 also
 tend
 to
 have
 more
 frail
 bones


in
 later
 life
 and
 is
 that
 linked
 to
 the


muscle
 loss?


>> So
 this
 is
 how
 it
 works.
 So
 both
 men
 and


women
 build
 bone
 and
 peak
 about
 up
 to
 25


some
 sometimes
 30
 and
 then
 bone
 loss


plateaus
 for
 a
 little
 while.
 Men


continue
 to
 lose
 about
 1%
 a
 year.
 So
 men


do
 not
 arrive
 with
 hip
 fractures
 or


devastating
 fractures


until
 their
 70s
 or
 80s
 or
 older.
 Women


also
 decline
 slowly
 until
 we
 lose
 our


estrogen.
 And
 then
 the
 rate
 of
 decline,


and
 I'll
 tell
 you
 why
 it
 happens,
 for


bone
 doubles
 or
 triples
 such
 that
 you


will
 lose
 15
 to
 20%
 of
 your
 bone
 density


during
 your
 pmenopausal
 period
 just
 from


loss
 of
 estrogen
 alone
 because
 estrogen


plays
 many
 roles.
 I've
 already
 talked


about
 estrogen
 being
 a
 huge


anti-inflammatory.
 Bones
 are
 very


sensitive
 to
 inflammatory
 chemicals
 in


your
 body.


Estrogen
 also
 directly
 affects
 the


balance
 of
 the
 two
 main
 cells
 that


subtract
 minerals
 from
 bone,
 the


osteoclast


and
 the
 cell
 that
 builds
 the
 bone,
 the


osteoblast.
 And
 in
 well
 hormoned
 times,


there
 is
 a
 balance.
 The
 body
 loves


balance.
 We
 take
 what
 we
 need,
 we
 build


it
 back.
 But
 because
 estrogen
 has
 such
 a


profound
 effect
 on
 the
 osteoclast,
 the


Pac-Man
 bone
 eating
 cell,


there's
 a
 dis
 there's
 an
 imbalance
 and


we
 take
 more
 bone
 than
 we're
 capable
 of


building.
 We're
 still
 building
 bone,
 but


the
 rate
 cannot
 keep
 up
 with
 this.
 So


with
 the
 inflammation,


with
 the
 direct
 effects
 on
 the


osteoclass,


women
 will
 lose
 bone
 density
 if
 they
 do


nothing.
 Well,
 number
 one,
 they're
 going


to
 lose
 bone
 density,
 but
 they
 must
 do


something
 about
 it.
 The
 reason
 it's
 so


critical


for
 a
 33y
 old
 is
 because
 you
 still
 have


your
 estrogen.
 So,
 let's
 learn
 how
 to


lift
 heavy.
 Let's
 take
 advantage
 of
 the


estrogen
 circulating.
 Let's
 learn
 to


have
 a
 jumping
 practice
 and
 impact
 our


bones.
 Right?
 So
 the
 the
 way
 our
 body


tells
 our
 bones
 to
 build
 more
 is
 um


there's
 another
 little
 cell
 called
 the


osteocy.
 It
 sits
 encased
 in
 bone
 but


it's
 connected
 to
 these
 other
 uh
 cells


by
 little
 tunnels
 that
 contain
 fluid.


When
 you
 jump,
 the
 biomechanical
 impulse


of
 that
 fluid
 shifting
 in
 the
 little


tunnels
 is
 translated
 into
 a
 biochemical


stimulation
 that
 tells
 the
 bone,
 "Oh
 my


god,
 she's
 jumping
 around.
 I
 need
 to


build
 more
 bone."
 So,
 we
 need
 that


impact
 to
 stimulate
 the
 laying
 down
 of


more
 bone.


>> I
 was
 looking
 at
 this
 graph,
 which
 is


what
 you
 were
 describing.


>> Yeah.
 um
 men
 and
 women
 aren't
 that
 far


away
 in
 terms
 of


bone
 mass.


>> So
 this
 is
 showing
 the
 fact
 that
 because


of
 the
 way
 testosterone
 interacts
 with
 a


man's
 bones,
 he
 will
 peak
 at
 a
 higher


bone
 mass
 than
 a
 woman
 will.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 he's
 starting
 at
 a
 higher
 level.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 I
 would
 want
 young
 women
 to
 do


everything
 humanly
 possible
 to
 start
 at


the
 highest
 possible
 level.
 But
 I
 see


lots
 of
 20
 year olds,
 30
 year olds,


really
 young
 women
 with
 poor
 bone


density
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 reasons.
 And
 so
 I'm


a
 big
 proponent
 for
 having
 bones


measured
 early.
 Don't
 wait
 until
 you're


old
 so
 you
 know
 where
 you're
 starting,


>> but
 that's
 not
 the
 standard


recommendation.


>> No,
 the
 standard
 recommendation
 is
 65,


which


>> long
 way


>> for
 that.
 But
 because
 I
 do
 do
 either
 a


DEXA
 scan
 or
 a
 REM's
 ultrasound
 to
 look


at
 bone
 quality
 on
 everybody,
 um,
 we
 can


catch
 it
 earlier.
 And
 that's
 really


important
 to
 get
 in
 front
 of
 it
 because


it's
 estimated,
 uh,
 research
 says
 that


in
 order
 to
 affect
 bone
 density,
 if


you're
 going
 to
 use
 estrogen
 for


instance,
 you
 need
 to
 have
 do
 it
 for
 10


years.


>> And
 why
 should
 people
 care
 about
 bone


density?
 Everyone
 cares
 about
 muscles,


but
 very
 few
 people
 talk
 about
 bones.


>> Fracture.
 can't
 carry
 your
 muscle
 around


if
 you
 have
 weak
 bones.


>> So
 without
 bone,
 muscle
 is
 just
 a


heaping
 pile
 of
 steaming
 metabolic


tissue
 sitting
 there,
 right?
 There
 would


be
 no
 bicep
 to
 complement,
 right?


Because
 it
 has
 to
 be
 connected
 to
 a


bone.
 So
 they're
 important
 for


locomotion
 and
 giving
 support
 to
 the


muscle.
 But
 bone
 is
 an
 endocrine
 organ


that
 secretes
 hormones
 that
 go
 to
 your


brain
 to
 help
 build
 neurons
 to
 your


pancreas
 to
 be
 active
 in
 insulin
 uh


release
 to
 the
 muscle
 for
 glucose


metabolism.
 In
 men
 to
 the
 testes
 to


build
 testosterone
 and
 that's
 only
 one


of
 the
 many
 hormones
 that
 the
 bone


produces.
 The
 bone
 is
 not
 not
 only


structural,
 not
 only
 hormonal.
 I've


already
 talked
 about
 it
 being
 a


storehouse,
 but
 it's
 an
 incubator
 in
 our


pelvis
 is
 where
 we
 build
 all
 of
 our


blood
 cells.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 so
 it
 has
 these
 multifunctions.


But
 to
 Mary
 Claire's
 point,
 for
 women,


40
 to
 50%
 of
 women
 will
 have
 low
 bone


density.
 And
 when
 you
 have
 that,
 50%
 of


the
 time
 you'll
 break
 a
 bone.
 So
 if


we're
 looking
 around
 at
 this
 table,
 if


we
 all
 have
 osteoporosis,
 which
 we


don't,
 uh,
 one
 in
 two
 of
 us
 will


fracture.
 When
 that
 fracture
 is
 a
 hip


fracture,
 which
 is
 very
 common,
 70%
 of


all
 hip
 fractures
 happen
 in
 women.


30%
 of
 the
 time
 when
 you
 hit
 the
 floor


and
 something
 breaks,
 you
 have
 a
 chance


of
 dying
 in
 one
 year.
 This
 quick,
 your


life
 changes.
 50%
 of
 the
 time,
 even
 if


you
 survive,
 you
 will
 never
 return
 to


prefall
 function,
 meaning
 you
 can't
 go


home.
 And
 that
 puts
 your
 family
 in
 this


situation
 of
 having
 to
 figure
 out


24-hour
 care


>> or
 you
 move
 in
 with
 your
 eldest
 daughter


or
 you
 go
 into
 a
 facility
 where
 you
 use


your
 life
 savings
 until
 you
 have
 no
 more


and
 then
 you
 have
 to
 apply
 for
 Medicaid


and
 the
 government
 will
 pay
 for
 it.


These
 are
 terrible
 situations


to
 get
 at
 something
 that
 we
 could
 have


prevented
 had
 we
 started
 early
 enough.


>> So,
 you
 want
 to
 start
 early.
 So,
 I'll


have
 Mel.
 So,
 Mel's
 going
 to
 be
 doing


strength
 training,
 not
 just
 for
 the


muscle
 benefits,
 but
 also
 because
 it's


going to
 help
 her
 build
 strong,
 healthy


bones
 in
 that
 critical
 decade.


>> Yep.
 And
 then
 we
 finish
 it
 with
 some


jump
 training.


>> Jump
 training.


>> Yeah.
 So
 plyometric
 type
 work
 or
 if


we're
 looking
 at
 not
 having
 the


robustness
 of
 doing
 straight
 pio
 then


you
 can
 do
 banded
 assisted
 pogos.
 You


can
 do
 low
 depth
 jumps
 so
 you're
 getting


some
 impact
 the
 bone
 because
 as
 um
 Dr.


Roy
 is
 talking
 about
 it's
 a


multidirectional
 stress
 not
 people
 think


oh
 I
 run
 I'm
 going
 to
 have
 strong
 bones


but
 running
 doesn't
 do
 it.
 You
 need


multidirectional
 stress.
 So
 if
 you
 think


about
 it
 when
 you
 land
 your
 body
 has
 to


move
 the
 ground
 doesn't.
 So
 it's
 called


the
 ground
 reaction
 force
 that
 comes
 up


through
 the
 bone
 to
 create
 that


strength.


>> So
 that
 ideal
 situation
 in
 a
 workout
 for


her
 would
 be
 some
 mobility,
 some
 heavy


lifting.
 If
 we're
 doing
 plyio,
 that's


also
 strength
 or
 a
 sprint
 type
 training.


So
 you're
 getting
 a
 metabolic
 stress.
 So


you're
 hitting
 all
 the
 major
 factors
 in


one
 1-hour
 workout.
 I
 read
 that
 um
 that


there
 was
 a
 study
 done
 with
 some


Australian
 elderly
 ladies
 on
 bone
 growth


>> on
 lifting
 and
 bone
 growth.


>> Yes.


>> Yeah.
 Lift
 more
 lift
 more
 study
 by
 Dr.


Beck.


>> Yes.


>> She
 was
 trying
 to
 dispel
 the
 myth
 which


I
 hear
 every
 day
 that
 you've
 got


osteoporosis,
 you
 can't
 lift
 weights.


>> Yes.


>> And
 so
 her
 study
 because
 we're
 big


proponents
 of
 teaching
 people
 to


progressively
 lift
 heavier
 and
 heavier


and
 that
 scares
 people.
 but
 especially


if
 you
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 break.
 So


she
 did
 a
 study
 where
 the
 load
 was
 five


reps,
 five
 sets
 under
 a
 supervised


situation.
 So
 five
 reps
 means
 that
 it


was
 heavy
 enough
 that
 at
 five
 reps
 they


were
 near
 failure.


>> Right?
 So
 these
 women
 all
 osteoporotic


not
 only
 were
 capable
 of
 lifting
 heavy


under
 supervision,
 none
 of
 them
 broke


and
 uh
 they
 built
 bone.


>> Yep.


So
 that
 answers
 the
 question,
 right?
 Can


you
 lift?
 Yes.


>> Yes,
 you
 can.
 And
 the
 other
 thing
 that


isn't
 really
 brought
 up
 into
 these


conversations
 is
 when
 you
 hit


pmenopause,
 not
 only
 is
 estrogen
 sort
 of


the
 stimulus
 for
 sat
 satellite
 cell


where
 we're
 building
 muscle
 cell,
 but
 it


has
 a
 distinct
 um
 I
 guess
 influence
 on


measin.
 So
 meosin
 and
 actin
 are
 are
 two


contractile
 proteins.
 So
 if
 you
 think


about
 a
 sliding
 filament
 or
 coming


together,
 you
 have
 meosin
 and
 actin
 that


bond
 together
 to
 then
 pull
 and
 move
 and


pull
 and
 move
 and
 that's
 how
 you
 have
 a


muscle
 contraction.
 Estrogen
 is


responsible
 for
 how
 tightly
 meosin
 bonds


to
 actin.
 When
 we
 start
 to
 lose
 estrogen


or
 we
 start
 to
 have
 variability
 in
 our


estrogen,
 we
 get
 myosin
 dysfunction.
 So


that
 means
 we're
 not
 going to
 get
 a
 very


strong
 contraction.


>> So
 we
 get
 weaker.


>> We
 get
 weaker.
 And
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the


very
 first
 things
 that
 people
 complain


about
 to
 me.
 I
 don't
 have
 power.
 I
 don't


have
 strength.
 I
 can't
 I
 my
 grip


strength's
 gone.
 I
 don't
 know.
 But
 their


body
 composition
 hasn't
 changed
 yet.
 So


if
 we
 think
 about
 lifting
 heavier
 loads,


it's
 a
 neuromuscular
 response.
 And
 that


direct
 stimulus
 creates
 the
 adaptive


change
 in
 measin
 that
 now
 estrogen
 isn't


responsible
 for.
 It's
 a
 different


external
 stress
 that
 creates
 that
 change


in
 measin
 to
 go,
 yep,
 I
 have
 to
 grab


onto
 actin
 and
 have
 a
 very
 strong


contraction.
 So
 we
 see
 that
 this


dysfunction
 happens
 first
 before
 we


start
 seeing
 a
 change
 in
 our
 lean
 mass


development.
 So
 if
 we
 are
 already
 in
 the


habit
 of
 lifting
 heavier
 loads,
 then
 we


can
 offshoot
 some
 of
 that
 measin


dysfunction
 that
 occurs
 with
 the


estrogen
 change.
 So
 when
 my
 patients


come
 in
 and
 they
 are
 looking
 to
 prevent


osteoporosis
 or
 they've
 gotten
 a


diagnosis
 of
 low
 bone
 density,
 you
 know,


what
 can
 they
 do?
 I've
 discussed
 the


Lyftmore
 trial.
 The
 new
 study
 just
 came


out
 May
 of
 this
 year
 of
 2025
 and
 they


looked
 at
 very
 similar
 to
 the
 protocol


used
 in
 Lyftmore.
 So
 there
 was
 a
 control


group
 where
 they
 just
 did
 nothing.
 Then


a
 group
 that
 did
 the
 they
 did
 three
 days


a
 week
 and
 they
 did
 resistance
 training


and
 jump
 training.
 And
 then
 the
 third


group
 did
 all
 the
 same
 exercises
 and


added
 HRT.
 And
 depending
 if
 they
 had
 a


uterus,
 they
 got
 estrogen
 or
 estrogen


plus
 a
 progesterrogen.
 And
 so,
 of


course,
 as
 expected,
 the
 do
 nothing


group
 lost
 bone.
 You
 gained
 bone
 as


expected
 in
 the
 resistance
 group,
 but
 it


seemed
 to
 be
 synergistic.
 When
 we
 added


hormone
 therapy
 and
 the
 resistance


training
 together,
 they
 grew
 even
 more


bone.
 They
 had
 even
 better
 results.
 So,


when
 my
 patients
 are
 like,
 I
 want
 to


hedge
 my
 bets.
 My
 mother
 fell
 and


fractured.
 she's
 broken
 her
 hip
 in
 a


nursing
 home,
 whatever.
 And
 I'm
 trying


to
 avoid
 this.
 I'm
 we're
 hitting
 all
 the


points
 and
 the
 only
 medication
 of
 it.


Now,
 we
 have
 other
 medicines
 that
 will


help
 slow
 down
 resorption
 of
 bone,
 the


bisphosphinates
 and
 stuff,
 but
 they,
 you


know,
 there
 they
 can
 be
 hard
 to
 take
 and


they
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 side
 effects.
 So,
 to


me,
 prevention
 is
 always
 better
 than


cure,


>> right?
 So,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 get
 them
 and


get
 them
 early.
 I
 just
 ignore
 the


guidelines
 that
 say
 you
 have
 to
 wait


till
 65
 unless
 you
 have
 some
 chronic


medical
 condition
 to
 get
 a
 bone
 density.


I'm
 telling
 patients
 you
 can
 find
 it
 for


about
 $99
 around
 I
 work
 in
 Houston
 and


that
 is
 worth
 the
 investment
 for
 you
 to


go
 get
 your
 baseline
 bone
 density.
 I


don't
 know
 a
 single
 orthopedic
 surgeon


you
 know
 a
 singer
 exercise
 physiologist


or
 anybody
 who
 deals
 with
 with


osteoporosis
 who
 thinks
 65
 is
 a
 good


idea.
 So
 if
 your
 listeners
 are
 like
 oh


well
 you
 know
 my
 insurance
 won't
 pay
 for


it.
 I'm
 like,
 there
 are
 centers
 popping


up
 now
 where
 you
 can
 go
 and
 get
 a
 DEXA


scan


>> and
 just
 pay
 out
 of
 pocket
 and
 get
 a


great,
 you
 know,
 and
 figure
 out
 where


your
 starting
 base
 is.


>> A
 DEXA
 scan
 is


>> a
 bone
 scan
 to
 see
 your
 bone
 density
 is


the
 easiest
 way
 to
 describe
 it


>> and
 your
 muscle
 mass.


>> Yeah,


>> they
 can
 do
 that
 as
 well.
 This


conversation
 is
 really
 important
 though


to
 extend
 besides
 just
 menopause
 or


permenopause
 that
 there
 are
 women
 of


reproductive
 age
 years
 who
 have
 profound


periods
 of
 low
 estrogen
 who
 are
 also
 at


risk
 for
 serious
 problems
 with
 their


bone
 density
 both
 now
 and
 down
 the
 road.


And
 so
 if
 you
 come
 to
 me
 and
 you
 say,


"Oh,
 I
 haven't
 had
 a
 period
 for
 7
 years.


No
 big
 deal."
 Well,
 that
 is
 a
 big
 deal.


And
 depending
 on
 the
 reason
 why,
 many
 of


the
 causes
 will
 result
 that
 you
 had
 low


estrogen
 and
 you
 were
 not
 ovulating
 and


you
 have
 hit
 that
 graph
 you
 showed
 of


while
 you're
 building
 your
 bone,
 that


person's
 on
 a
 different
 trajectory.
 And


those
 women
 do
 need
 bone
 scans
 much


earlier
 so
 that
 we
 can
 see
 where
 they


are
 and
 see
 what
 treatment
 we
 need.
 But


it's
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 reasons.
 Bone


health
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 acceptable


medical
 reasons
 for
 why
 we
 should
 put


younger
 women
 who
 are
 have
 low
 estrogen


time
 periods
 onto
 estrogen
 treatment


because
 it
 can
 so
 profoundly
 change


their
 bone
 health
 long
 term.
 So
 in
 my
 uh


niche
 of
 active
 women,
 we
 see
 there's
 a


very
 very
 high
 incidence
 of
 recreational


active
 women
 and
 low
 energy


availability,
 meaning
 they're
 not
 eating


enough
 to
 support
 daily
 life
 as
 well
 as


their
 training.
 So
 the
 subclinical


aspect
 of
 not
 eating
 enough
 creates
 a


myriad
 of
 of
 issues
 that
 does
 create


lower
 bone
 density,
 menstrual
 cycle


dysfunction,
 greater
 inflammatory


responses.
 So
 you
 know
 the
 end
 result


would
 be
 hypothalamic
 amenora.
 So
 their


periods
 have
 stopped
 which
 is
 a
 low


estrogen
 standpoint.
 So,
 you
 know,


keeping
 track
 of
 of
 your
 period,
 make


sure
 you're
 eating
 enough
 is
 one
 of
 the


first
 stop
 gaps
 that
 we
 have
 in
 the


athletic
 realm.
 It's
 like
 we
 want
 you
 to


eat
 enough.
 And
 if
 you're
 looking
 at


bookending
 our
 calories
 on
 either
 end
 of


the
 day,
 that's
 not
 appropriate.
 We
 have


to
 look
 at
 how
 your
 circadian
 rhythm


works
 because
 the
 circadian
 rhythm,
 like


we
 talked
 about
 in
 the
 first
 um
 half,


was
 about
 the
 pulses
 of
 our
 hormones.
 So


if
 we're
 holding
 our
 calories
 on
 either


end
 of
 the
 day,
 then
 there's
 this
 big


space
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 day
 where


your
 body
 thinks
 it's
 under
 a
 starvation


threat.
 So
 you
 start
 to
 have
 this
 down


downturn
 of
 all
 of
 our
 metabolic


functions.
 We
 see
 after
 4
 days
 of
 low


energy
 availability,
 there's
 a
 direct


impact
 on
 thyroid
 function.
 So
 we
 have


to
 be
 very
 cognate
 that
 women
 who
 are


saying,
 "I
 haven't
 had
 a
 period
 in
 seven


years
 or
 my
 periods
 are
 really


irregular."
 We
 have
 to
 bring
 it
 back
 to


the
 energy
 function
 as
 well.
 So,
 I
 know


unfortunately
 we're
 still
 in
 this


environment
 of
 aesthetics
 and
 I'm
 always


like,
 we
 need
 to
 eat.
 And
 if
 you
 eat
 in


and
 around
 your
 training
 and
 fueling


appropriately
 for
 what
 you're
 doing,
 it


has
 a
 positive
 impact
 on
 body


composition.


>> You're
 not
 going
 to
 gain
 body
 fat,


you're
 going
 to
 gain
 lean
 mass,
 you're


going
 to
 gain
 bone,
 and
 you're
 going
 to


see
 a
 decrease
 in
 body
 fat.
 But
 it's
 a


trusting
 the
 process
 that
 out
 in
 general


socioultural
 concepts
 is
 just
 not


acceptable
 for
 so
 many
 women
 right
 now.


>> And
 with
 that
 exercise
 regime
 I
 asked


you
 to
 make
 for
 a
 woman
 that's
 pre


premenopause.


>> Was
 there
 anything
 left
 off
 there?
 We


had
 day
 one
 which
 is
 mobility
 works


strength
 training.


>> So
 if
 you
 were
 to
 do
 three
 days
 a
 week


in
 the
 gym
 that
 would
 be
 pretty
 similar


except
 for
 the
 compound
 movement.
 What


are
 we
 doing
 for
 each
 of
 those
 compound


movements?
 A
 different
 muscle.
 So
 it


would
 be
 the
 knee
 forward
 squat
 motion


one
 day,
 push
 pull
 upper
 body
 next,
 and


then
 uh
 posterior,
 so
 your
 hip
 thrust,


your
 deadlifts,
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.


Because
 women
 are
 quad
 dominant
 to


prevent
 injury,
 we
 really
 need
 to
 build


the
 posterior
 chain.
 And
 this
 is
 your


glutes,
 your
 hamstrings,


>> your
 deadlifts,


>> your
 Yeah.
 So
 you're
 getting
 really
 uh


strong
 around
 the
 knee
 joints,
 the
 hip


joints
 because
 again
 that
 feeds
 forward


to
 better
 movement,
 movement
 economy
 and


prevention
 of
 a
 misstep
 for
 a
 hip


fracture
 later
 down.


>> What
 about
 cardio?
 And


>> so
 that's
 where
 like
 if
 we're
 looking
 at


those
 three
 days
 a
 week
 and
 we're


finishing
 with
 pio
 or
 some
 sprint
 work,


then
 the
 other
 days
 just
 walking,
 lowle


intensity
 walking
 or
 maybe
 you
 have
 soul


food,
 you
 want
 to
 go
 for
 a
 bike
 ride,


you
 want
 to
 go
 for
 a
 run.
 If
 you're
 not


training
 specifically
 for
 something,


then
 those
 three
 strength
 training
 days


are
 your
 key
 workouts
 and
 then
 you
 can


pepper
 in
 all
 the
 other
 things
 that
 you


like
 to
 do.


>> I
 hear
 a
 lot
 about
 V2
 maxes,
 so
 I


thought
 but
 we
 should
 all
 be
 driving
 our


cardiovascular
 performance
 up
 to
 get
 a


high
 V2
 max.


>> Well,
 that's
 where
 the
 intensity
 is.


Yeah,


>> I
 think
 it's
 only
 I
 mean,
 and
 correct
 me


if
 I'm
 wrong,
 but
 my
 understanding
 after


reading
 and
 watching
 everything
 is


doesn't
 take
 that
 much
 to
 build
 V2
 max.


doesn't
 it's
 that
 high
 intensity
 that's


a
 little
 bit
 uncomfortable
 where
 you're


pushing
 at
 that
 max
 for
 uh
 you
 know


about
 four
 minutes
 to
 build
 that
 V2


in
 the
 sports
 science
 world
 it's
 always


been
 the
 4x4
 the
 Norwegian
 4x4


>> 4
 minutes
 on
 four
 minutes
 off
 four


minutes
 on
 four
 minutes


>> but
 that's
 not
 three
 days
 a
 week
 no


>> protocol
 is
 once
 a
 week


>> once
 a
 week
 at
 the
 most
 right


>> and
 the
 other
 sprints
 just
 to
 give
 you
 I


tend
 to
 give
 my
 examples
 because
 it


makes
 it
 more
 real
 but
 When
 I'm
 doing


sprint
 intervals,


um,
 I
 do
 it
 the
 30
 seconds
 on
 and
 then


complete
 recovery,
 meaning
 I'm
 for
 30


seconds
 I'm
 taking
 my
 heart
 rate
 as
 high


as
 I
 can
 get
 it


>> and
 then
 I'll
 completely
 recover,
 which


takes
 me
 two
 to
 three
 minutes.


I
 just
 happen
 to
 do
 it
 on
 a
 treadmill,


but
 the
 reality
 is
 you
 can
 do
 it
 on


anything.
 It's
 a
 heart
 rate
 function,


not
 an
 apparatus
 function.
 So,
 for
 me,


on
 a
 treadmill,
 after
 I'm
 done
 warming


up,
 you
 can't
 do
 it
 cold
 or
 you'll
 hurt


something.


>> Exactly.


>> After
 I'm
 done
 warming
 up,
 cuz
 I'm
 a


really
 short
 person,
 I
 punch
 the


treadmill
 up
 to
 11
 and
 I
 am
 just
 working


so
 hard
 I
 don't
 fly
 off
 the
 back.
 But


that
 gets
 my
 heart
 rate
 up
 really
 high,


about
 186.
 Everybody's
 top
 heart
 rate
 is


different.


>> And
 then
 I
 completely
 recover.
 And
 I
 do


that
 four
 times.


>> And
 that's
 all
 you
 need.


>> It
 doesn't
 take
 that
 long.
 And
 you
 feel


so
 good
 when
 you're
 done.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 can't
 run
 at
 the
 moments.


This
 morning
 I
 did
 explosive
 kettle
 bell


swings.


>> Why
 can't
 you
 run
 at
 the
 moment?


>> Uh
 torn
 hamstring
 and
 miniscus.
 So
 I


can't
 run
 at
 the
 moment.


>> Running
 is
 in.


>> Run
 clubs
 have
 come


>> in
 strong.
 It's
 back
 in.


>> It's
 not
 happening.


Are
 you
 at
 all
 concerned
 with
 the
 fact


that
 people
 are
 running
 all
 the
 time
 and


doing
 resistance
 training
 less?
 Because


running
 is
 cool
 like
 cool
 now.
 It's
 how


people
 date.
 It's
 it's
 they're
 not
 going


to
 nightclubs.


>> It's
 a
 sacrifice
 of
 other
 things.
 It's


like
 we
 said
 about
 Pilates,
 you
 know,
 if


all
 you
 do
 is
 running,
 then
 that
 is


definitely
 not
 the
 best
 way
 to
 be.
 It's


not
 the
 healthiest
 for
 your
 whole
 body.


It's
 not
 that
 you're
 unhealthy,
 but


we're
 really
 talking
 about
 how
 are
 we


optimizing
 your
 body
 and
 your
 hormonal


health
 for
 a
 variety
 of
 different
 goals.


But
 also,
 if
 we
 look
 very
 micro
 at


running,
 58%
 of
 runners
 have
 a
 ludal


phase
 defect.
 That
 means
 that
 the
 second


half
 of
 their
 menstrual
 cycle
 is
 not


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 last
 as
 long
 as
 we


want
 it
 to.
 Likely
 due
 to
 what
 Stacy
 was


talking
 about
 earlier,
 this
 relative


energy
 deficiency
 coming
 back
 to
 the


brain.
 the
 brain
 signals
 not
 as
 strong


to
 keep
 that
 corpus
 ludium
 what
 happens


after
 the
 follicle
 alive
 and
 a
 lot
 of


women
 say
 I
 still
 have
 my
 period
 so
 I'm


okay
 but
 if
 we're
 using
 our
 cycle
 as
 a


vital
 sign
 we
 can
 actually
 say
 the
 ratio


of
 energy
 balance
 is
 not
 great
 and
 it's


often
 because
 we're
 doing
 it
 at


sacrifice
 of
 other
 things.
 So,
 if
 you're


doing
 the
 strength
 training
 three
 times


a
 week
 and
 you're
 running,
 however,


you're
 spacing
 out
 your
 other
 days,


that's
 such
 a
 healthy
 balance.
 It's
 hard


that
 you're
 going to
 be
 in
 a
 bad


position
 with
 that
 and
 you'll
 actually


improve
 your
 running
 more
 so
 than
 if
 you


were
 to
 run
 every
 day
 or
 every
 other


day.
 Cuz
 if
 you're
 getting
 strong


through
 full
 range
 of
 motion,
 then
 that


feeds
 forward
 to
 better
 running
 economy.


Then
 you
 can
 vary
 your
 pace
 without


getting
 injured.
 But
 for
 people
 who
 are


running
 every
 day
 and
 they're
 shuffling


and
 they're
 getting
 stronger
 in
 their


strong
 muscles
 and
 weaker
 in
 their
 weak


muscles,
 then
 it
 perpetuates
 this.


>> And
 they're
 in
 my
 clinic.


>> Yeah.


>> People
 are
 very
 keen
 on
 doing
 marathons


and
 half
 marathons
 at
 the
 moment
 and
 got


a
 couple
 of
 friends
 that
 are
 doing
 a
 lot


of
 marathons
 at
 the
 moment
 and
 they're


very
 very
 very
 skinny.


>> Oh,
 welcome
 to
 my
 world
 of
 Texas.


>> Yeah.
 Is
 that
 healthy?
 I'm
 not
 even
 sure


if
 that's
 that's
 the
 right
 question
 or


one
 can
 judge
 from
 just
 looking
 but


being
 extremely
 skinny
 in
 that
 regard


being
 that
 sort
 of
 marathon
 runner


physique


>> there
 are
 some
 that
 are
 naturally


predisposed
 to
 that


>> right
 so
 naturally
 predisposed
 having


really
 good
 running
 economy
 running


biomechanics
 having
 a
 leaner
 body
 and


this
 is
 what
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 the


Olympics
 earlier
 where
 we
 can
 see
 the


ideal
 body
 type
 for
 that
 particular


sport
 and
 then
 there
 are
 those
 like
 me


who
 build
 muscle
 naturally
 it's
 pretty


easy
 so
 I'd
 never
 be
 a
 skinny
 little


runner
 and
 my
 running
 economy
 is
 a


little
 bit
 off
 because
 of
 where
 I
 build


muscle
 versus
 not.
 So,
 not
 everyone
 is


meant
 to
 be
 a
 long-distance
 runner
 and


there
 are
 some
 that
 are
 meant
 to
 be


long-distance
 runners.
 So,
 if
 we're


talking
 about
 your
 friends
 who
 are
 like


super
 skinny,
 are
 they
 e
 economically


viable
 for
 being
 a
 long-distance
 runner?


Possibly.
 But
 we
 also
 have
 to
 look
 are


they
 male
 or
 female?
 What
 is
 their


injury
 rate?
 What
 is
 their
 fueling?
 And


then
 for
 me,
 I'd
 want
 to
 see
 the
 dexas


of
 the
 women
 that
 are
 just
 training
 long


distance
 and
 super
 skinny
 because
 most


of
 the
 time
 we
 see
 a
 higher
 visceral
 fat


in
 um
 in
 and
 around
 the
 organs
 as
 we're


talking
 about.
 Even
 though
 on
 the


outside
 look
 super
 lean,
 but
 they
 have
 a


really
 high
 percentage
 of
 visceral
 fat


because
 of
 the
 inflammation,
 the
 low


energy
 intake
 and
 most
 likely
 estradile


suppression.


>> And
 that's
 the
 skinny
 fat
 thing
 you
 you


talked
 earlier.
 Is
 is
 there
 an


evolutionary
 lens
 on
 this?
 I
 always


think
 about
 this
 when
 we're
 having
 these


conversations
 like
 what
 what
 used
 to


happen
 thousands
 of
 years
 ago.


>> If
 we
 talk
 about
 the
 evolutionary


biological
 theories
 and
 there
 are
 a
 lot


of
 sociologists
 that
 will
 counter
 what


I'm
 getting
 ready
 to
 say,
 so
 I'll


apologize
 in
 advance.
 We
 look
 at


original
 huntergatherer
 type


communities.
 The
 male
 body
 was
 designed


to
 go
 out
 to
 find
 the
 calories.
 The


women
 body
 was
 designed
 to
 stay
 and
 take


care
 of
 the
 offspring
 and
 make
 sure
 that


home
 was
 set.
 If
 it
 was
 low
 calorie,


menstrual
 cycle
 would
 stop
 because
 you


didn't
 want
 to
 reproduce
 in
 a
 time
 of


low
 calories.
 Body
 fat
 would
 come
 on


because
 there
 weren't
 a
 lot
 of
 calories.


>> And
 so
 the
 equival
 now
 is
 that
 I'm
 not


eating
 enough
 or
 I'm
 burning
 more
 than


I'm
 consuming.


>> Exactly.


>> So
 I'm
 in
 a
 calorie
 deficit
 in
 some
 way.


>> Exactly.
 In
 an
 energy
 deficit.
 So
 with


the
 male
 body
 and
 we
 see
 this
 their


brain
 and
 hypothalamus
 is
 not
 as


sensitive
 to
 those
 nutrient
 deficits
 as


much
 as
 a
 woman's
 body
 because
 we
 have


menstrual
 cycle
 and
 menstrual
 cycle


function.
 A
 man
 will
 lean
 up
 and
 get


more
 cognitively
 focused
 in
 times
 of
 low


calorie
 intake.
 So
 this
 is
 what
 we
 see


with
 fasting
 data
 and
 we
 see
 with


restrictive
 diets


>> and
 that
 was
 we
 need
 to
 bring
 it
 back
 to


that
 biological
 lens.
 low
 calorie,
 I


have
 to
 go
 find
 the
 calories.
 I
 have
 to


be
 fit
 to
 go
 find
 the
 calories.
 Low


calories,
 I
 need
 to
 not
 have
 to
 eat
 as


much.
 So,
 I
 need
 to
 store
 fat
 and
 I


can't
 have
 a
 baby
 because
 we
 don't
 have


enough
 calories.


>> And
 then
 stress,


>> when
 we
 add
 modern
 stress
 onto
 that,


that's
 a
 comprehensive
 addition
 of


cortisol
 and
 addition
 of
 inflammation


and
 that
 also
 perpetuates
 body
 fat.


>> I
 mean,
 like
 stress
 10,000
 years
 ago


would
 have
 been
 like
 a
 lion.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 It's
 a
 lionic,
 right?
 We
 had


stress
 and
 that
 this
 is
 a
 natural
 stress


response.
 We
 have
 to
 have
 them
 to


survive.
 But
 these
 were
 episodic,


>> right,


>> stresses.
 Well,
 and
 your
 hormones
 would


change
 for
 a
 very
 specific
 purpose
 that


you
 would
 then
 go
 do.
 Your
 body
 would


free
 up
 glucose
 from
 your
 liver.
 You're


getting
 it
 ready
 in
 your
 bloodstream
 so


you
 can
 go
 run
 from
 the
 lion
 and
 then


things
 would
 shift
 back
 to
 normal.
 And


what's
 happening
 with
 chronic
 stress
 is


you're
 getting
 all
 the
 hormone
 shifts


because
 your
 body's
 really
 getting
 ready


for
 the
 lion
 except
 it's
 just
 that
 bad


meeting
 you
 had
 and
 then
 you're
 just


sitting
 there
 longer
 and
 you're
 not


using
 that
 glucose
 up.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.


>> Are
 women
 increasingly
 overtraining?


>> I
 think
 the
 problem
 in
 this
 country
 is


not


maybe
 in
 the
 women
 who
 are
 really


intentional
 maybe
 there
 are
 some
 that


are
 overex
 exercising
 but
 if
 we
 look
 at


a
 population


nobody
 is
 exercising
 enough.
 Exactly.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 would
 take
 People
 ask
 me
 all


the
 time,
 "Tell
 me
 the
 first
 thing


people
 need
 to
 do."
 I'm
 like, "I'll
 take


anything."


>> I
 mean,
 I'll
 take
 getting
 off
 the
 couch


with
 any
 method,
 whatever
 makes
 you


happy.


>> I'll
 say,
 get
 off
 the
 couch
 and
 do
 10


air
 squats.
 Thank
 you.


>> That's
 enough.
 Yeah,
 that's
 enough.


>> Resistance
 train.


>> So,
 so
 in
 the
 crowd
 that's
 like,
 I'm


going
 to
 invest
 in
 my
 health
 every
 day.


>> That
 is
 not
 the
 majority
 of
 people.


>> Yeah,


>> that's
 my
 bubble.
 Yeah,
 but
 who
 the


people
 who
 listen
 to
 your
 show
 might
 be


a
 different
 demographic
 we
 have
 to


acknowledge,
 right,
 than
 population
 of


America.
 I
 mean
 like
 a
 lot of
 people
 who


listen
 to
 your
 show,
 Stephen,
 are


interested
 in
 health
 and
 their
 body
 and


achieving
 certain
 goals.
 And
 so


certainly,
 you
 know,
 I
 have
 practiced


fertility
 in
 North
 Carolina
 and
 in


Austin
 and
 I
 see
 a
 completely
 different


patient
 population,
 you
 know,
 in
 Austin,


Texas,
 which
 is
 a
 very
 fit
 area.
 PE


women
 are
 constantly
 overtraining.
 But


to
 Stacy's
 point
 earlier
 about
 this


maybe
 evolutionary
 what
 happens


women
 go
 into
 this
 hypothalamic


dysfunction
 even
 before
 it's
 what
 we


call
 like
 amenora.
 Hypothamic
 amenorhea


is
 essentially
 where
 the
 brain
 where
 the


hypothalamus
 is
 shuts
 off
 says
 can't


reproduce
 right
 now.
 XYZ
 reason
 no
 FSH


and
 LH
 are
 coming
 out.
 You're
 not


ovulating.
 You're
 not
 making
 estrogen.


You're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 pregnant.


>> So
 you're
 more
 likely
 to
 survive.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 a
 survival
 mechanism.


>> Pregnancy
 is
 dangerous
 as
 in
 hunter


gatherers,


>> but
 there's
 state
 modern
 medicine
 acts


like
 you're
 perfect
 or
 it's
 turned
 off.


And
 the
 reality
 is
 there's
 all
 these


shades
 of
 gray
 in
 between
 where
 these


different
 chronic
 stressors
 and
 your


insulin
 resistance
 and
 your
 inflammation


and
 you're
 overex
 exercising
 and
 you're


under
 fueling
 come
 in
 and
 make
 it
 so
 the


hypothalamus
 is
 not
 responding


correctly.
 And
 that's
 what
 we're
 trying


to
 get
 people
 to
 intervene
 there
 before


it
 gets
 too
 bad.
 And
 I
 see
 a
 large


number
 of
 women
 who
 do
 fall
 into
 that


zone
 where
 they
 are
 trying
 their
 hardest


to
 be
 healthy,
 but
 what
 they
 are


choosing
 to
 do
 is
 actually
 having
 a


negative
 impact
 on
 their
 hormonal
 health


and
 how
 their
 brain
 is
 interpreting


their
 hormones.
 And
 you
 it's
 very
 rare


to
 see
 that
 in
 a
 man.
 Meaning
 the
 number


one
 reason
 why
 I
 will
 see
 low


testosterone
 is
 purely
 because
 many
 men


are
 taking
 testosterone
 or
 because
 of


other
 exogenous
 factors
 like
 marijuana


use.
 It
 is
 very
 rarely
 my
 brain
 is
 not


sending
 out
 the
 signals
 to
 cause
 my


testicles
 to
 make
 testosterone.
 I
 like


to
 frame
 it
 where
 women
 are
 under


recovering
 not
 overtraining.


>> So
 if
 we're
 under
 recovery
 then
 it
 makes


it
 more
 acceptable
 to
 fuel
 and
 I
 always


want
 to
 bring
 it
 back
 to
 it
 doesn't


matter
 like
 because
 I
 come
 from
 high


performance
 I'm
 going
 to
 use
 those
 words


where
 it's
 like
 you're
 not
 recovering


enough.
 We
 want
 to
 focus
 on
 recovery
 on


these
 days.
 We
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that


you're
 eating
 and
 fueling
 around.
 So,


it's
 never
 overtraining.
 It's
 always


under
 the
 balance
 is
 wrong.
 They're
 not.


>> So,
 what
 do
 you
 say
 to
 all
 the
 voices
 on


social
 media
 that
 are
 just
 yelling
 at


mostly
 women
 and
 telling
 them
 it's
 just


a
 matter
 of
 willpower


>> and
 you
 don't
 have
 the
 body
 composition


you
 deserve.


>> Well,
 you
 swipe
 left
 and
 don't
 talk
 to


those
 people.


>> But
 that's
 me,
 right?
 But
 I
 mean,
 I'm


talking
 to
 the
 woman
 in
 Ohio
 who's


feeling
 defeated
 and
 stumbles
 across


someone
 screaming
 at
 her
 on
 the
 internet


that
 her
 body
 composition
 that
 she's
 not


happy
 with


>> is
 her
 fault.
 I
 hate
 that
 because
 it's
 a


construct
 of
 society,
 right?
 Especially


western
 society.
 This
 is
 where
 we
 have


to
 educate.
 It's
 not
 your
 fault.
 These


are
 the
 things
 that
 have
 come
 into
 play


and
 lined
 up
 to
 create
 this
 situation.


But
 now
 we
 have
 tools
 to
 offer
 you
 to


take
 one
 step
 out
 of
 that
 situation
 and


let's
 see
 how
 many
 more
 steps
 we
 can
 get


you
 away
 from
 the
 situation
 to
 improve


your
 health.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 are
 the
 rules
 of
 exercise
 slightly


different
 once
 you've
 entered


permenopause?


So,
 this
 is
 where
 we
 really
 need
 to
 look


at
 how
 we
 can
 use
 exercise
 and
 some


environmental
 stress
 to
 create
 a
 really


strong
 adaptive
 stress
 and
 a
 really


strong
 recovery
 stress.


>> Stacey,
 can
 you
 explain
 adaptive
 stress?


Because
 I'm
 thinking
 of
 the
 10,000


people
 who
 follow
 me
 who
 will
 be
 like,


>> "You
 have
 no
 idea
 what
 adaptive
 stress


is."
 So,
 if
 I
 go
 and
 I
 uh
 do
 some


resistance
 training,
 some
 heavy
 lifting,


I
 want
 to
 create
 a
 stress
 on
 my
 body


that's
 going
 to
 then
 have
 a
 signaling


cascade
 to
 repair
 the
 muscle
 in
 a


stronger
 way
 than
 when
 I
 first


>> lifting
 the
 muscle
 damages
 the
 muscle.


>> Yes.
 And
 it
 creates
 a
 series
 of
 feedback


mechanisms
 that
 make
 it
 repair
 stronger


than
 when
 you
 first
 went
 in.
 So,
 that's


an
 adaptive
 stress.
 And
 we're
 looking
 at


what
 levels
 of
 stress
 we
 can
 put.
 So


it's
 a
 training
 stress
 or
 what
 levels
 of


stress
 we
 can
 use
 through
 exercise
 to


really
 really
 create
 an
 environment
 that


improves
 our
 health.
 Okay.


>> So
 if
 we
 talk
 about
 sprint
 interval


training,
 the
 30
 seconds
 on
 and
 the
 two


to
 three
 minute
 recovery,
 the
 reason
 why


we
 want
 that
 super
 high-end
 stress
 of


our
 heart
 rate
 is
 it
 then
 creates
 a


eventual
 epigenetic
 change.
 So,
 it's


that
 environment
 that's
 going
 to
 create


a
 change
 within
 the
 muscle
 that's
 going


to
 allow
 that
 glute
 4
 protein
 that
 I


mentioned
 earlier
 to
 open
 up
 and
 have


glucose
 come
 in,
 reducing
 insulin


resistance.
 Also,
 with
 that
 really
 high


high
 heart
 rate,
 we're
 having
 a
 lot
 of


stress
 on
 the
 muscle
 that's
 going
 to


release
 some
 myioines,
 which
 are
 little


hormone
 signals
 that
 then
 will
 go
 to
 the


liver
 and
 say,
 "Wait
 a
 second,
 we
 don't


need
 to
 store
 visceral
 fat.
 we
 need
 to


create
 non-estrified
 fatty
 acids
 which


can
 then
 go
 into
 our
 skeletal
 muscle
 to


be
 used
 in
 the
 mitochondria
 as
 fuel.
 So


we
 want
 to
 have
 the
 stress
 that's
 strong


enough
 to
 create
 these
 cascades
 of


feedback
 mechanisms
 to
 improve
 our


overall
 health.


>> If
 we
 stay
 in
 that
 moderate
 intensity


zone,
 we
 aren't
 creating
 a
 strong
 enough


stress


>> to
 create
 that
 signaling.


>> What
 are
 we
 doing?


>> We
 are
 exacerbating


inflammation.
 we're
 exacerbating


cortisol.
 Now,
 cortisol
 isn't
 the
 demon,


but
 when
 we
 have
 an
 elevation
 of
 it,
 and


especially
 in
 pmenopause,
 when
 we're


sympathetically
 driven
 and
 we
 already


have
 a
 higher
 level
 of
 baseline


cortisol,
 if
 we
 are
 continuously
 in
 this


moderate
 intensity
 zone,
 we
 never
 get
 a


signal
 to
 allow
 that
 to
 drop.
 So
 if


we're
 looking
 at
 polarizing
 which
 is
 top


top
 end
 and
 low
 recovery
 end
 then
 with


the
 top
 end
 we
 get
 the
 signal
 cascade


of
 improving
 body
 comproving
 uh
 insulin


sensitivity
 as
 well
 as
 getting
 growth


hormone
 and
 testosterone
 responses
 which


then
 feed
 back
 to
 drop
 cortisol.


>> So
 am
 I
 right
 in
 thinking
 the
 solution


if
 I'm
 permenopausal
 is
 to
 do


highintensity
 interval
 training
 for


short
 periods
 of
 time.
 So,
 we
 look
 at


the
 quality
 of
 the
 training,
 not
 the


volume
 of
 the
 training.
 So,
 if
 we're
 in


our
 reproductive
 years,
 then
 yes,
 you


can
 do
 the
 moderate
 intensity
 stuff


because
 you
 have
 estrogen
 and
 some
 of


our
 other
 hormone
 feedback
 signals
 that


are
 going
 to
 drop
 cortisol.
 It's
 going


to
 allow
 your
 body
 to
 recover
 and


repair.


>> And
 when
 you
 what
 makes
 quality


training?
 What
 is
 quality
 training?


>> So,
 this
 is
 your
 polar.
 So,
 you
 have
 a


very
 specific
 session
 that
 you're
 going


to
 do.


>> So,
 for
 Vonda,
 it's
 your
 30
 seconds
 on


as
 hard
 as
 possible,
 2
 to
 3
 minutes


recovery.
 You
 do
 that
 four
 times.
 That's


your
 session.


>> Okay.
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 and
 summarize


this.


>> See
 if
 this
 is
 a
 test.
 See
 if
 I


understood
 all
 of
 this
 stuff.
 So,
 if
 I


do
 a
 lot
 of
 volume,
 but
 I
 I
 play
 in
 that


sort
 of
 medium
 intensity
 range,
 I'm


basically
 just
 like
 stressing
 out
 my


body
 in
 all
 the
 worst
 ways.


>> Exactly.


>> Like
 the
 inflammation,
 it's
 just
 not


good
 for
 my
 body
 necessarily.
 If
 I
 don't


do
 vigorous
 enough
 exercise,
 then
 that's


also
 bad
 because
 nothing's
 going
 to


break
 and
 therefore
 build.
 it's


nothing's
 going
 to
 adapt,
 nothing's


going
 to
 grow.


>> If
 I
 do
 it
 for
 long
 periods
 of
 time,


really
 anything
 for
 long
 periods
 of


time,
 that's
 also
 stress.
 But
 the
 key


thing
 to
 do
 is
 to
 do


shorter,
 higher
 intensity


exercise
 that
 will
 cause
 my
 body
 to


adapt,
 but
 won't
 put
 it
 into
 that


inflamed
 stressful
 state.


>> And
 you
 also
 have
 to
 pepper
 in
 some


lower
 intensity
 work.
 So
 this
 is
 your


>> flexibility.


>> Mhm.
 so
 that
 you
 have
 recovery,
 you're


getting
 u
 blood
 flow
 circulating,
 you're


tapping
 into
 some
 mitochondrial
 work
 so


that
 you
 are
 still
 getting
 benefit
 of


exercise
 but
 it's
 not
 in
 that
 modern


intensity.
 So
 that's
 what
 we
 mean
 by


polarizing.
 So
 if
 we
 were
 to
 talk
 in


like
 the
 zones
 talk
 that
 everyone
 talks


is
 out
 there,
 right?
 We're
 looking
 at


>> what
 is
 zones?


>> So
 if
 we're
 talking
 about
 heart
 rate
 and


the
 way
 that
 your
 body
 works,
 we
 have


zone
 one,
 which
 is
 just
 sitting
 around,


you
 know,
 like
 you're
 Yeah,


>> we're
 in
 zone
 one.
 in
 zone.


>> Zone
 two
 is
 the
 bro
 science
 kind
 of


thing
 where
 you're
 like,
 let's
 let's


work
 in
 this
 zone
 two
 area
 where
 we're


working.


>> I
 was
 in
 zone
 two
 when
 you
 were
 talking


about
 menstrual
 cycle.


>> Okay,
 there
 you
 go.
 That's
 it.
 A
 little


elevated.


>> Your
 heart
 rate's
 elevating.
 Still
 a


little
 bit
 have
 a
 conversation.
 Um,
 for


women,
 it's
 good
 for
 recovery,
 stress


release.
 For
 men,
 it's
 good
 to
 improve


metabolic
 flexibility.
 When
 we're


looking
 at
 zone
 3,
 four,
 that's
 the
 area


you
 want
 to
 stay
 out
 of
 unless
 you're


specifically
 training
 for
 something
 that


requires
 you
 to
 be
 there.
 So
 that
 would


be
 your
 half
 marathons,
 your
 endurance


races,
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.


>> Everyone
 wants
 to
 stay
 out
 of
 zone


>> 3,
 four,


during
 cuz
 that's
 the
 medium
 range,


right?


>> Yeah,
 that's
 medium
 range.


>> So
 you
 want
 to
 jump
 into
 zone
 five,
 hang


around
 for


>> five,
 six.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 A
 couple
 of
 minutes
 and
 then
 get


out
 of
 there.


>> Yeah.
 But
 in
 a
 week,
 this
 is
 what


>> Yeah,
 let's
 be
 clear.
 So,


>> two
 to
 four
 days
 a
 week,
 you
 should
 be


lifting
 progressively
 to
 lift
 heavy,


meaning
 um
 heavier
 weights,
 fewer
 reps,


right?
 One
 compound
 lift
 a
 day,
 plus
 the


augmentive
 lifts
 that
 go
 behind
 it,


right?
 So,
 you're
 warming
 up
 first,
 then


you're
 going
 to
 do
 one
 lift,
 and
 then


you're
 going
 to
 do
 your
 jumping
 or
 your


balance
 work.
 The
 other
 days
 of
 the
 week


you
 will
 do
 preferably


low
 intensity
 doing
 anything.
 Walking


briskly
 down
 the
 New
 York
 street
 could


count
 as
 that.
 It's
 it's
 continuous


motion.
 And
 then
 a
 couple
 days
 a
 week


add
 in
 your
 sprint
 intervals,
 your


really
 high
 zone
 five
 six
 high


intensity.


And
 then
 when
 you've
 got
 that,


you
 can
 add
 in
 your
 4x4
 V2
 max


on
 one
 of
 the
 other
 days
 because
 it


sounds
 like
 a
 lot,
 but
 when
 I
 work
 with


non-pro
 alathletes,
 I
 layer
 on


behaviors.


>> Absolutely.


>> Because
 if
 I
 say
 all
 of
 this
 at
 once,


>> Yeah.


>> nobody's
 going
 to
 do
 anything.


>> I
 always
 describe
 it
 as
 we
 have
 these


pillars,
 right?
 First,
 we
 have
 to
 nail


sleep.
 Doesn't
 matter
 who
 you
 are,
 you


have
 to
 because
 you
 cannot


>> sleep
 is
 non-negotiable.


>> Yeah.
 We
 cannot
 invoke
 any
 kind
 of


metabolic
 or
 body
 composition
 change


without
 adequate
 sleep.
 Also
 improves


stress
 resilience.
 Then
 we
 look
 at


nutrition
 and
 physical
 activity.
 The


behaviors
 that
 go
 with
 both
 of
 those
 are


somewhat
 independent.
 You
 have
 some


people
 that
 are
 more
 motivated
 to
 do


physical
 activity
 and
 some
 people
 who


are
 more
 motivated
 to
 change
 nutritional


habits.
 Most
 of
 the
 time
 they're
 two


different
 personalities.
 So
 we
 have
 to


look
 at
 what
 comes
 next.
 And
 then
 we


also
 have
 which
 isn't
 lesser
 importance


but
 often
 neglected
 is
 the
 mindfulness


and
 community.
 So
 this
 is
 being
 out
 in


nature.
 It's
 connecting
 with
 friends.


Might
 be
 going
 to
 a
 group
 exercise


class.
 It
 might
 be
 just
 having
 coffee


but
 that
 is
 really
 really
 important
 for


parasympathetic
 and
 whole
 like
 whole


being
 response.
 Exactly.


>> So
 there's
 a
 new
 book
 out
 um
 coming
 out


called
 Joycepan.
 I
 don't
 know if
 you've


spoken
 with
 her.
 So
 she's
 a


gerontologist
 and
 works
 with
 the
 very


elderly
 and
 she
 has
 a
 very
 specific,


>> you
 know,
 what
 determines
 who's
 going
 to


kill
 it
 in
 that
 last
 decade
 of
 life.
 And


>> that
 community
 part
 using
 your
 brain,


you
 know,
 having
 interactions
 with
 human


beings
 seems
 to
 be
 the
 key.
 And
 if
 you


don't
 keep
 that
 going
 through
 this
 40s,


50s,
 60s,
 when
 you
 get
 to
 70
 and
 80,


you're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 a
 great
 end
 of


your
 life.


>> What
 about
 the
 last
 phase
 then?
 So


someone's
 post
 menopausal,


>> does
 their
 exercise
 recommendations


change
 at
 all?


>> We
 like
 to
 start
 the
 habits
 early
 and


continue
 them
 through.
 If
 you
 haven't


started,
 it's
 not
 too
 late.
 As
 we're


seeing
 like
 with
 Lyftmore
 and
 some
 other


of
 the
 older
 age
 resources
 coming
 out,


it's
 never
 too
 late
 to
 start.
 We
 just


have
 to
 be
 very
 careful
 of
 how
 you
 start


to
 have
 support
 and
 phase
 you
 into
 these


different
 exercise
 mo
 modalities.


>> Is
 it
 the
 same
 exercises
 though?
 meaning


>> you
 know
 the
 three
 days
 a
 week
 the


mobility
 the
 strength


>> I
 am
 firmly
 postmenopausal
 and
 I
 am


doing
 all
 these
 things


>> but
 it's
 different
 different
 people


always
 ask
 me
 what
 does
 heavy
 lifting


mean


>> right
 it's
 relative


>> it's
 relative
 my
 heavy
 is
 not
 going
 to


be
 Stacy's
 heavy
 or
 I
 should
 say
 it
 the


other
 way
 Stacy's
 very
 heavy
 is
 not


going
 to
 be
 my
 heavy


>> in
 lift
 more
 they
 just
 the
 authors


describe
 the
 one
 the
 one
 rep
 max
 and
 so


one
 rep
 max
 is
 like
 safely
 what
 is
 the


heaviest
 you
 can
 do
 one
 rep,
 you
 know.


So,
 for
 a
 bicep
 curl,
 what
 is
 the


heaviest
 weight
 I
 can
 do
 one
 to
 fail?


You
 know,
 I'm
 going
 to
 fail
 after
 this


one.
 And
 for
 me,
 that
 was
 about
 20


pounds


>> with
 good
 form.


>> Exactly.
 Safely
 with
 good
 form.
 And
 so,


I
 could
 nail
 20.
 And
 so,
 then
 they
 took


them
 down
 to
 about
 70
 80%
 of
 that.
 Um,


which
 for
 me
 was
 about
 15
 16
 pounds.
 So,


that
 you
 can
 usually
 do
 about
 five
 reps


before
 you
 hit
 failure.
 And
 that
 is
 what


they
 consider
 lifting
 heavy.
 That
 seemed


to
 really
 resonate
 with
 my
 followers
 to


understand
 what
 that
 meant.


>> And
 there's
 so
 many
 women
 that


underestimate
 their
 strength.


>> See
 them
 and
 they
 gravitate
 towards
 the


10
 lb
 dumbbells.
 It's
 like,
 put
 that


away.
 Go
 to
 the
 next
 one.
 Do
 a
 couple
 of


lifts
 with
 that.
 And
 then
 ideally,
 I


want
 you
 to
 put
 that
 away
 and
 pick
 up


the
 next
 one
 cuz
 that's
 going
 to


challenge
 you.
 Because
 women
 have
 been


so
 conditioned
 to
 do
 10
 to
 15
 reps
 to


get
 quote
 toned
 and
 not
 really
 put
 in


the
 work
 they
 need
 to
 to
 build
 muscle


and
 to
 get
 the
 benefit
 out
 of
 strength


training.
 And
 I
 always
 telling
 women,


you're
 underestimating
 yourself
 in
 so


many
 facets.
 Don't
 cheat
 yourself
 with


the
 strength
 training
 as
 well
 because


people
 have
 to
 remember
 what
 we're
 what


we're
 training
 for
 now.
 It's
 different


than
 I
 had
 a
 woman
 recently
 say,
 "I
 was


taught
 to
 do
 biceps
 curls
 five
 pounds
 30


times."
 Well,
 after
 30
 times,
 not
 only


are
 you
 bored,
 but
 you'll
 probably
 be
 at


failure
 30
 times.


>> That
 will
 build
 endurance.
 I
 am
 training


to
 be
 as
 strong
 as
 possible.
 And
 when


I'm
 a
 when
 I
 have
 strength
 down,
 then
 I


start
 playing
 with
 tempo
 so
 that
 I
 could


build
 replace
 some
 of
 the
 explosive


muscle
 fibers
 that
 I'm
 going
 to
 lose


over
 time.
 to
 your
 point
 wonder
 I
 um


just
 been
 writing
 my
 book
 in
 Cape
 Town


as
 I
 was
 I
 told
 you
 before
 we
 started


recording
 and
 one
 of
 the
 studies
 that
 I


read
 about
 while
 I
 was
 writing
 the
 book


was
 a
 study
 done
 by
 some
 a
 guy
 called


Hal
 Hersshfield
 and
 his
 colleagues
 where


they
 asked
 they
 put
 people
 in
 these
 MRI


scanners
 and
 they
 asked
 them
 to
 think


about
 a
 famous
 celebrity
 and
 then
 they


asked
 them
 to
 think
 about
 themselves


today
 and
 then
 they
 asked
 them
 to
 think


about
 themselves
 in
 10
 years
 time
 and
 in


10
 years
 time
 the
 same
 brain
 regions
 lit


up
 as
 if
 they
 were
 thinking
 about
 the


celebrity


>> which
 kind
 kind
 of
 led
 them
 to
 conclude


that
 in
 our
 brain
 we
 almost
 see
 our


future
 selves
 as
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 stranger.


>> Yes,
 that's
 right.


>> And
 so
 when
 we
 think
 about
 long-term


planning,
 this
 is
 in
 part
 why
 a
 lot
 of


this
 advice
 is
 often
 most
 effective
 when


it's
 put
 in
 the
 context
 of
 like


short-term
 performance
 or
 cognitive


benefits
 because
 we
 really
 do
 struggle


to
 like
 care
 about
 ourselves
 at
 90.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 we
 I
 think
 we
 all
 kind
 of
 think
 we


can
 just
 I
 figure
 it
 out
 later.
 I
 think


what's
 different
 for
 women,
 especially


in
 menopause,
 is
 because
 we're
 also


taking
 care
 of
 our
 parents
 in
 so
 many


ways.
 You
 know,
 we're
 in
 this
 like


raising
 kids,
 going
 through
 our
 own


hormonal
 upheaval,
 and
 then
 watching
 our


mothers,
 our
 grandmothers,
 our
 aunts


age.
 And
 we,
 the
 way
 society
 is
 set
 up,


women
 become
 the
 caretakers
 of
 their


parents,
 generally
 the
 oldest
 daughter.


And
 I
 have
 to
 give
 full
 credit
 to
 my


sister
 who
 lives
 in
 the
 same
 town
 as
 my


mom
 and
 is
 a
 nurse.
 So,
 she
 really
 is


bearing
 the
 brunt
 of
 taking
 care
 of
 mama


because
 I'm
 living
 this
 life.
 So,
 thank


you
 Leah
 if
 you're
 watching.
 It
 is
 such


a
 tremendous
 stress,
 you
 know,
 and
 so


our
 motivation,
 my
 sister
 and
 I,
 is
 like


>> we
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 this
 to
 our


daughters.


>> Exactly.
 The
 other
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 bring


in
 is
 the
 brain
 health
 component,
 right?


We
 talk
 about
 Alzheimer's
 and
 dementia


and
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 I
 really
 preface


doing
 highintensity
 work
 is
 the
 lactate


production
 because
 we're
 finding
 more


and
 more
 research
 coming
 out
 um
 showing


that
 part
 of
 the
 development
 of
 dementia


and
 Alzheimer
 and
 the
 plaque
 is
 a


misstep
 in
 brain
 metabolism.
 So
 when


we're
 looking
 at
 brain
 metabolism
 and


the
 brain
 uses
 a
 lot
 of
 glucose,
 it
 also


uses
 lactate.
 Now
 for
 women,
 we
 have


less
 of
 the
 glycolytic
 or
 lactate


producing
 fibers
 and
 we
 tend
 to
 lose


those
 with
 age.
 Men
 are
 born
 with
 more


tend
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 them
 more.
 So
 it's


not
 necessarily
 as
 big
 an
 issue
 for


lactate
 production.
 Men
 need
 to
 spend


more
 time
 in
 the
 low
 intensity
 being


able
 to
 produce
 more
 of
 our
 fat
 burning


capacity.
 But
 for
 women,
 doing
 that


highintensity
 work
 and
 being
 able
 to


produce
 lactate
 to
 then
 allow
 the
 heart


and
 the
 brain
 to
 use
 that
 preferential


fuel
 feeds
 forward
 to
 reducing
 the


misstep
 in
 this


brain
 metabolism
 component
 that
 occurs


and
 it's
 such
 a
 sex
 difference.
 We're


seeing
 a
 a
 change
 in
 glucose
 metabolism


in
 and
 around
 perry
 menopause
 into


menopause.
 M


>> so
 it's
 that
 lactate
 production
 that
 I


is
 kind
 of the
 offshoot
 of
 the


highintensity
 work
 that's
 super


important
 for
 brain
 health
 as
 well
 as


>> when
 you
 look
 at
 glucose
 metabolism
 in


the
 brain
 I'm
 talking
 specifically


coming
 out
 of
 Arizona
 and
 and
 from
 Lisa


Muscone's
 work
 and
 they
 looked
 at


glucose
 utilization
 in
 the
 brain


especially
 the
 forebrain
 through
 the


transition
 it's
 wildly
 different
 based


on
 what
 phase
 of
 pmenopause
 menopause


and
 postmenopause


that
 they're
 in.
 And
 it's
 it's


absolutely
 astounding.
 And
 they're


seeing
 patterns
 that
 can
 give
 clues
 that


may
 be
 the
 women
 who
 are
 headed
 towards


the
 dementia
 route
 versus
 those
 who


aren't.


>> And
 women
 are
 significantly
 more
 likely


than
 men
 to
 develop
 dementia
 and


Alzheimer's
 largely
 because
 they
 have


certain
 unique
 biological
 risk
 factors


and
 also
 because
 they
 live
 longer.
 Um


>> and
 the
 socioultural
 component.
 I
 keep


bringing
 it
 up
 because
 I
 work
 stress.


Yeah.
 But
 also,
 if
 we're
 looking
 at


women
 who
 are
 80,
 90
 years
 old
 now,


their
 upbringing
 to
 this
 point
 is


completely
 different
 than
 ours.
 Meaning


that
 the
 job
 availability
 and
 the
 brain


stimulation
 they
 had
 when
 they
 were
 in


their
 40s,
 30s,
 40s,
 50s,
 completely


different
 than
 what
 we
 have
 now.


>> Better
 or
 worse,


>> worse.
 So,
 they
 didn't
 have
 necessarily


opportunity
 to
 be
 scientists,
 lawyers,


medical
 doctors.
 So,
 they
 didn't
 have
 as


much
 stimulation
 of
 brain
 and
 and


implications
 on
 that
 neuroplasticity.


So,
 we're
 seeing
 a
 higher


episodic


issue
 of
 dementia
 and
 Alzheimer's
 in


older
 women
 now
 because
 they
 didn't
 have


the
 same
 lay
 down
 effect
 that
 we
 have


now
 as
 50
 year olds,
 40,
 50
 year olds.


And
 this
 and
 the
 stimulus
 we
 have
 for


neuroplasticity.


>> Oh,
 so


>> like
 you're
 laying
 down
 brain
 pathways


and
 neural
 fibers.


>> So,
 neuroplastic,
 think
 about
 it
 like


the
 bone,
 but
 you're
 creating
 pathways


in
 your
 brain
 to
 make
 you
 healthier
 by


resilient
 more
 resilient
 um


But
 but
 they're
 also
 going
 to
 have
 more


stronger
 brain
 younger


>> are
 they
 not
 going
 to
 have
 more
 stress


if
 they're
 working


>> maybe
 more
 hours.


>> Fascinating
 study
 and
 this
 one
 shot
 me


out
 of
 a
 cannon
 emotionally
 was
 if
 you


choose
 to
 become
 a
 caretaker
 of
 a
 parent


with
 dementia
 you
 have
 a
 60%
 increased


risk.
 Now
 there's
 a
 genetic
 component,


but
 when
 they
 took
 the
 genetics
 out
 of


it
 and
 they
 feel
 like
 it's
 the
 stress
 of


caregiving
 for
 that
 parent,
 you
 are


signing
 your
 own
 death
 warrant
 because


now
 you
 are
 increasing
 your
 risk
 of


death.


>> Am
 I
 cuz
 Yeah,
 cuz
 I'm
 right
 in
 thinking


that
 women
 are
 still
 both
 caregiver
 and


now
 in
 the
 corporate
 world.


>> Yes.
 Yep.


>> Yes,
 that's
 right.


>> So
 it's
 both.


>> Yep.


>> Stress
 from
 both
 ends.
 Lactate


production
 for
 the
 win.
 Get
 that


glucose.
 You
 have
 to
 have
 an
 active
 plan


to
 combat
 this,
 right?
 We're
 not
 going


to
 live
 in
 a
 world
 that
 is
 stress
 free.


If
 you're
 a
 woman
 in
 the
 world,
 you
 are


likely
 to
 have
 a
 caretaking
 role
 in
 some


fashion,
 even
 if
 you
 are
 chasing
 other


dreams
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 professionally.


Building
 good
 brain
 pathways
 is


wonderful
 as
 far
 as
 a
 way
 to
 help
 start


from
 a
 higher
 standpoint
 before
 you
 have


brain
 loss.
 However,
 we've
 just
 like


we've
 said
 on
 these
 other
 tangents,
 the


brain
 is
 that
 too.
 We
 need
 to
 think


about
 active
 ways
 we're
 going
 to
 combat


what
 is
 happening
 in
 today's
 world


naturally.
 And
 some
 of
 the
 factors
 are


modern
 society
 that
 put
 us
 into
 this


pro-in
 inflammatory
 state.
 But
 we
 need


to
 think
 about
 making
 lactate.
 What
 you


know
 what's
 important
 for
 us?
 And
 it


really
 is
 a
 plan.
 This
 whole
 I'm
 going


to
 figure
 it
 out
 when
 I'm
 90
 and
 the


problems
 in
 front
 of
 me
 is
 too
 late
 for


these
 medical
 problems.


>> So,
 and
 back
 to
 your
 point
 about


neuroplasticity,
 we're
 not
 reading
 as


much.
 We're
 on
 our
 phones
 and
 so
 not
 in


my
 house.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 as
 as
 a
 culture
 there's


there's
 this
 worry
 that
 all
 this
 time
 on


the
 phone
 and
 these
 dopamine
 hits
 and


but
 not
 creating
 stories
 in
 your
 head


and
 and
 reading
 for
 pleasure
 at
 night.


You
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 women
 are
 on
 their


phones
 now
 before
 bed
 rather
 than


developing
 that
 neuroplasticity
 that
 we


get
 from
 storytelling.


>> I
 did
 something
 at
 24
 years
 old
 that
 has


had
 a
 profound
 impact
 on
 my
 life.
 I
 set


myself
 the
 challenge
 of
 posting
 every


single
 day
 on
 my
 social
 media
 channels.


And
 at
 the
 time,
 I
 was
 doing
 it
 to
 grow


my
 following.
 But
 it
 had
 this
 profound


impact
 on
 my
 life.
 And
 two
 remarkable


things
 happened
 when
 I
 did
 that.
 I


managed
 to
 learn
 faster
 because
 every


single
 day,
 I'm
 capturing
 what
 is


happening
 to
 me
 and
 trying
 to
 distill
 it


down
 into
 something
 that
 I
 can
 share


with
 the
 world.
 But
 more
 remarkably,
 it


led
 me
 to
 building
 a
 following
 of
 many


millions
 of
 people.
 And
 that's
 the
 basis


that
 I
 used
 to
 launch
 the
 diary
 of
 a


SEO.
 And
 that's
 why
 I
 want
 to
 tell
 you


about
 our
 sponsor
 today,
 Adobe
 Express.


They
 are
 the
 platform
 that
 I
 use
 to
 make


all
 the
 posts
 across
 my
 LinkedIn
 and


across
 my
 Instagram.
 It's
 a
 couple
 of


clicks
 and
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 be
 an


expert
 and
 that
 is
 why
 I
 love
 using
 it


because
 I'm
 not
 an
 expert
 in
 graphic


design.
 It's
 accessible
 to
 use
 for
 all


of
 us
 even
 if
 we
 don't
 have
 the


technical
 prowess
 to
 design
 great


things.
 So
 if
 you
 want
 to
 start


compounding
 both
 your
 reach
 and
 your


knowledge
 like
 I
 did
 at
 24
 years
 old,


then
 head
 to
 adobe.


Steven
 and
 get
 started
 with
 Adobe


Express.
 That's

The
 next
 question
 that
 came
 in
 from
 the


audience,
 we
 we
 asked
 a thousand
 women


to
 submit
 their
 questions.
 The
 next
 one


is,
 what's
 the
 best
 and
 healthiest
 way


for
 a
 woman
 to
 lose
 weight?


>> Lift
 weights.


>> Lift
 weights


>> and
 eat.


>> And
 eat.
 Yes,
 absolutely.
 And
 you
 could


have
 a
 very
 slight
 calorie
 deficit


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 evening.


>> Running


>> as
 a
 way
 of
 burning
 calories.
 The


problem
 is
 people
 think
 that
 they
 can


out
 exercise
 a
 bad
 diet
 and
 you
 can't.


>> Composition
 of
 your
 diet
 matters


immensely.


>> And
 I
 hate
 calling
 it
 lose
 weight.
 I
 now


call
 it
 recomposition.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 let
 me
 put
 it
 in
 context.
 Yeah.
 Go


run.
 You're
 going
 to
 burn
 100
 calories
 a


mile.
 Three
 Girl
 Scout
 cookies,
 three


thin
 mints,
 US
 favorites,


>> is
 180
 calories.


>> My
 fave.


>> So
 you
 have
 to
 run
 two
 miles
 to
 eat


three
 cookies.
 Most
 of
 us,
 if
 you're


going
 to
 eat
 cookies,
 don't
 eat
 three


Thin
 Mints.
 You
 eat
 the
 whole
 sleeve.


Right.
 To
 your
 point,
 it
 is
 impossible


to
 out
 exercise
 food
 unless
 you're
 a


high
 level
 athlete,


thousand
 calories.


>> Even
 then,
 no.
 Because
 we
 look
 at
 diet


composition.


>> And
 we
 see
 that
 um
 endurance
 athletes


who
 use
 a
 lot
 of
 high
 sugary
 type


carbohydrate
 like
 the
 gels
 and
 the


sports
 stuff,
 they've
 interrupted
 their


gut
 microbiome
 so
 much
 that
 they
 have


>> sugar
 alcohols.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 it's
 not
 even
 that.
 It's
 the


fillet
 change.
 We're
 seeing
 a
 decrease


in
 the
 diversity.
 Even
 though
 they're


exercising
 and
 we
 see
 that
 exercise


increases
 the
 diversity
 of
 the
 gut


microbiome,
 is
 what
 they're
 eating


during
 the
 training
 with
 the
 heat
 and


hypoxic
 stress
 that
 is
 creating
 the


growth
 of
 the
 fermicis


fil
 that's
 associated
 with
 o
 obese


outcomes.


>> So
 that's
 it
 changes
 the
 gut
 the
 gut


bacteria.
 Yeah.
 if
 they
 are.


>> So,
 we
 have
 this
 mis
 Yeah,
 we
 have
 this


misconception
 that
 if
 you're
 an
 elite


athlete
 and
 you're
 burning
 all
 these


calories,
 then
 you're
 just
 eating
 to


fuel,
 right?
 But
 it's
 not.
 It's
 the


quality
 of
 the
 diet.
 If
 we
 want
 to


perform
 well,
 whatever
 performance


means,
 if
 you're
 Olympic
 athlete
 down
 to


recreational
 person
 who
 just
 wants
 to


accomplish
 a
 5K,
 the
 composition
 of
 your


diet
 is
 immensely
 important.


>> What
 about
 Zmp?
 Everybody
 seems
 to
 be
 on


a
 Zen
 GLP1s.
 I
 prescribe
 it
 and
 our


clinic
 is
 all
 permenopause
 and
 menopause


and
 so
 we
 always
 start
 with
 let's
 see


how
 you
 do
 with
 lifestyle
 changes
 first.


So
 we
 give
 that
 3
 to
 6
 months.
 When
 they


come
 back,
 every
 time
 they
 come
 back,


we're
 doing
 another
 body
 composition


chen
 for
 probably
 50%
 of
 the
 patients


lifestyle
 plus
 or
 minus
 HRT.
 They're


their
 body
 composition
 changes.
 They're


happy.
 They're
 health,
 you
 know,
 they're


much
 healthier.
 Everything's
 moving
 in


the
 right
 direction.
 So
 now
 we're
 left


with
 the
 people
 who
 are
 doing
 all
 the


things.


>> This
 isn't
 the
 typical
 story
 of
 people


that
 start
 a
 Zen
 though.
 They
 see
 it
 on


Instagram
 and
 then
 a
 week
 after
 I'll
 be


at
 their
 house
 and
 I'll
 be
 like,
 "We"


and
 they'll
 tell
 me,
 "Yeah,
 I'm
 on
 a


Zen."
 And
 it's
 really
 it's
 usually
 just


someone
 sees
 it
 online,
 they
 hear
 it
 on


a
 podcast,
 and
 they're
 on
 it
 within
 a


couple
 of
 days.


>> That
 access
 is
 getting
 easier,
 the
 price


is
 coming
 down.
 And
 there
 is
 for
 any


medication,
 there
 are
 risks,
 there
 are


benefits,
 and
 there's


ways
 that
 will
 promote
 health.
 And
 with


any
 medication,
 you
 can
 not
 promote


health
 if
 you
 give


>> I
 mean,
 GLP1s
 can
 be
 revolutionary
 for


certain
 people.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 not


training
 for
 a
 5K,
 let
 alone
 anything


else.
 And
 we
 know
 if
 we
 go
 very
 simply,


fat
 cells,
 right,
 they
 make
 a
 different


type
 of
 estrogen.
 They're
 inflammatory.


You
 have
 insulin
 resistance.
 And
 all
 of


this
 sets
 you
 up
 at
 a
 deficit
 to
 say,
 "I


want
 to
 get
 healthier."
 It
 for
 women,


we'll
 say
 who
 have
 PCOS
 who
 already
 have


a
 predisposition
 for
 insulin
 resistance.


Gio,
 they
 have a
 harder
 time
 losing


weight
 because
 now
 they're
 also
 storing


visceral
 fat.
 We
 know
 they
 get
 on
 this


cycle
 with
 hormonal
 change.
 you
 know,


being
 on
 ozimic
 allows
 them
 to
 lose


weight
 and
 combat
 insulin
 resistance
 in


a
 faster
 way
 than
 they've
 ever
 been
 able


to
 do
 before.
 And
 especially
 when
 it


comes
 to
 fertility
 and
 you're
 on
 a


timeline,
 that
 can
 be
 really


revolutionary
 when
 you
 lose
 weight


because
 that
 estone
 decreases.
 Many


women
 with
 PCOS
 if
 they
 were
 overweight


will
 start
 ovulating
 again
 because
 that


suppression
 from
 the
 additional
 estrogen


is
 gone
 and
 their
 inflam
 inflammation


markers
 go
 down
 their
 insulin
 resistance


decreases.
 So
 there's
 a
 subset
 of
 people


who
 have
 found
 their
 life
 changed
 by


them
 and
 we
 never
 want
 to
 discredit


that.
 Many
 people
 have
 had
 difficulty


losing
 weight,
 chronic
 medical


conditions
 have
 been
 able
 to
 reverse


them
 and
 this
 has
 been
 a
 tool
 in
 the


tool
 box


>> because
 about
 70%
 of
 Americans
 would
 fit


in
 that
 category
 of
 chronic
 health


conditions,
 difficulty
 losing
 weight.


>> Yeah,
 73%
 right
 now
 are
 overweight
 or


obese.


>> So
 should
 73%
 of
 Americans
 be
 on
 GLP


once


>> and
 was
 higher
 in
 women?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 we
 always
 one
 common
 thing


is
 having
 tools
 in
 the
 toolbox
 and
 being


able
 to
 know
 when
 to
 use
 them,
 when
 to


offer
 them.
 Just
 like
 when
 we
 have
 the


HRT
 discussion,
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 see


people,
 we'll
 say
 women
 for
 this


discussion,
 not
 being
 offered
 a


therapeutic
 option
 because
 or
 not


choosing
 it
 out
 of
 fear.


>> Well,
 when
 I
 hear
 that
 it's
 going
 to


help
 me
 lose
 weight


>> and
 I've
 got
 two
 options.
 I
 can
 go
 out


and
 lift
 all
 these
 weights,
 Stacy,
 and
 I


can
 which
 you
 know,
 one
 I
 don't
 Yeah,


it's
 hard,
 isn't
 it?
 go
 to
 the
 gym,
 I


have
 to
 put
 my
 shoes
 on
 or
 all
 these
 all


these
 things.
 Or
 I
 can
 take
 this


injection


>> and
 lose
 all
 your
 muscle
 and
 lose
 your


bone
 and
 end
 up
 like
 the
 little
 floating


figure
 in
 Wall-E
 movie
 that
 I've
 talked


about
 before,
 right?
 And
 that's
 that's


my
 fear
 of
 just
 blanket
 people
 using


>> you're
 also
 whether
 you
 mean
 to
 or
 not


giving
 the
 illusion
 that,
 you
 know,


willpower
 is
 all
 you
 need
 to
 lose
 weight


by
 what
 you
 said,
 right?
 I
 can
 either
 do


these
 hard
 things
 or
 I
 can
 choose
 this


medication
 which
 appears
 to
 be
 the


easier
 way
 out.
 And
 two
 things
 can
 be


true
 at
 once.
 People
 can
 work
 extremely


hard.
 Maybe
 they
 don't
 understand


exactly
 what
 they
 should
 be
 doing
 and


that's
 part
 of
 what
 we're
 trying
 to


change
 the
 discussion
 on.
 But
 reversing


some
 metabolic
 change
 even
 initially
 can


make
 a
 big
 difference
 in
 their
 game


plan.
 But
 you
 will
 lose
 body
 weight
 on


these
 medications.
 And
 so
 you
 have
 to


have
 somebody
 you
 know
 guiding
 the
 ship.


I
 think
 what
 we
 all
 don't
 love
 is
 the


access
 without
 oversight.
 Meaning,


nobody's
 helping
 you
 say,
 "How
 are
 you


not
 losing
 muscle?
 How
 are
 you
 doing


this
 in
 a
 safe
 fashion?"
 You
 can
 just


text
 somebody
 on
 an
 app
 and
 suddenly


have
 the
 medication
 shipped
 to
 your


house.
 You
 know,
 in
 our
 clinic,
 it
 is
 an


hourong.
 Now,
 they're
 coming
 in
 to


discuss
 the
 GLP1
 option.
 It
 is
 an


hourong
 visit


>> of
 risks,
 benefits,
 side
 effects,


protein
 intake,
 resistance
 training,


mandatory.
 We
 will
 follow
 your
 bone


density.
 We
 will
 follow
 your
 bone
 mass.


I
 mean,
 your
 muscle
 mass.
 You
 know,
 we


have
 these
 scanners.


>> These
 are
 great


>> available.
 And
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 to


a
 number
 on
 the
 scale
 and
 sacrifice
 your


long-term
 health.
 And
 my
 patients
 are


drinking
 the
 Kool-Aid.
 They're
 coming


in.
 They
 they've
 found,
 you
 know,


>> they're
 coming
 to
 you
 for
 a
 reason.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so,
 I'm
 a
 little
 bit
 unique
 in


my
 clinic
 in
 that
 I
 have
 a
 social
 media


following
 and
 people
 kind
 of
 watch
 a
 few


things
 before
 they
 come
 see
 me.
 So,
 they


know
 my
 they're
 not
 shocked
 by
 me
 giving


this
 advice
 because
 I
 give
 it
 all
 day
 on


social
 media.
 So
 if
 you
 give
 them
 the


ismpeek
 but
 they
 still
 don't
 go
 to
 the


gym,
 they
 still
 don't
 do
 anything
 else,


>> then
 we'll
 stop
 giving
 it
 to
 you.


>> They
 won't
 be
 healthy
 and
 they
 know


that.
 We've
 talked
 to
 them
 about
 that.


We've
 explained
 it
 on
 the
 front
 end
 that


this
 is
 a
 tool
 in
 your
 toolkit
 because


we
 can
 see
 their
 muscle
 mass.
 We
 won't


renew
 the
 prescription
 if
 they've
 lost


the
 muscle.
 So
 if
 you
 are
 losing
 weight


and
 not
 lifting
 and
 eating
 enough


protein
 on
 ompic
 or
 any
 way
 else
 and
 you


do
 a
 body
 composition,
 you
 may
 see
 total


weight
 lost.
 You
 will
 see
 pounds
 of


muscle
 loss,
 you
 may
 see
 body
 fat


percentage
 loss.
 But
 if
 you
 do
 this


correctly
 with
 enough
 protein
 in
 your


diet
 and
 lifting
 weights,
 the
 amount
 of


muscle
 loss
 will
 be
 very
 small
 versus


amount
 of
 fat
 loss.


>> So
 you
 we
 know
 we
 are
 going
 to
 lose
 a


little
 muscle,
 but
 you
 can't
 lose
 8


pounds
 of
 muscle.


>> Right.


>> Right.
 So
 we
 can
 tell
 and
 I
 give
 them


the
 hard
 numbers
 like
 10%
 is
 acceptable.


We're
 going
 over
 that.
 We're
 getting


into
 the
 danger
 zone.
 We're
 going
 to
 cut


back
 on
 your
 dose.
 we're
 going
 to,
 you


know,
 but
 they
 commit
 to
 the
 the
 work
 on


the
 front
 end.


>> I
 think
 that's
 the
 important
 point
 is


that
 these
 GLP1
 antagonists
 don't
 burn


your
 fat.
 They
 burn
 they
 stop
 you
 eating


as
 much.


>> They
 stop
 there,


>> which
 is
 going
 to
 mess
 up
 which
 is
 going


to
 reduce
 everything.
 Cuz
 I
 was
 thinking


about
 myself.
 I
 was
 thinking,
 well,
 I
 I


go
 to
 the
 gym
 every
 day.
 I'm
 going to


keep
 going.
 So
 maybe
 if
 I
 had
 a
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 Zanek
 or
 whatever
 it's
 called,


>> then
 my
 it
 would
 burn
 my
 fat.
 But


actually,
 that's
 not
 it's
 just
 gonna


stop
 me
 eating,
 which
 is
 gonna
 reduce
 my


muscle,
 my
 burden.


>> Right.
 Goodbye
 biceps.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 the
 that's
 the
 thing.
 It's


like


>> I'll
 lose
 my
 subscribers
 and


>> Exactly.
 Exactly.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay,
 that
 makes
 sense.
 So
 to
 this


person
 asking
 what's
 the
 best
 and


healthiest
 way
 to
 lose
 weight?
 The


response
 is
 stop
 eating
 the
 cookies
 and


start
 lifting
 some
 weights.
 Oh,


>> the
 8020
 rule,
 right?
 So
 80%
 of
 the
 time


you're
 on
 it,
 right?
 You're
 paying


attention
 to
 a
 high
 quality
 diet.
 You


are
 eating
 according
 circadian
 rhythm.


You
 are
 doing
 the
 strength
 training.


You're
 getting
 the
 good
 sleep.
 And
 then


20%
 is
 life
 where
 I'm
 going
 to
 stay
 up


late.
 I'm
 going
 to
 have
 some
 wine
 or


whiskey.
 I'm
 going to
 go
 out.
 I'm
 going


to
 be
 on
 vacation.
 So,
 you're
 not


excluding
 all
 the
 fun
 things
 in
 life.
 If


it
 comes
 to
 a
 point
 where
 you're
 like,


I'm
 still
 not
 budging
 the
 needle,
 then


maybe
 it's
 a
 9010
 rule
 where
 90%
 of
 the


time
 you're
 on
 it
 and
 10%
 is
 the
 life


factor.
 There's
 these
 hard
 and
 fast


rules
 I've
 been
 accused
 of
 giving.
 I


don't
 give
 rules.
 I
 give
 optimization


ideas.
 So,
 it's
 not
 following
 strict


8020
 or
 9010.
 It's
 what
 fits
 in
 your


life.
 And
 if
 you're
 really
 motivated
 on


losing
 weight,
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 tell


people
 to
 do
 is
 ditch
 alcohol.


>> Mhm.
 Everyone
 wants
 to
 lose
 the
 the
 part


on
 the
 belly.


>> Sure.


>> Is
 there
 not
 like
 an
 exercise
 I
 can
 do


just
 to
 burn
 the
 part
 on
 the
 belly?


>> Exercise
 burn.


>> So
 visceral
 fat's
 a
 little
 bit


different.
 It's
 like
 a
 whole
 different


organ.
 So
 you
 know
 when
 we
 talk
 about


visceral
 fat,
 it
 has
 different
 drivers.


You
 know,
 we
 drive
 fat
 to
 the


intraabdominal
 cavity.
 It
 has
 it
 creates


different
 cytoines.
 Subcutaneous
 fat
 is


a
 storage
 facility.
 It
 is
 when
 we


overeat
 calories,
 we
 will
 drive
 fat


under
 the
 skin.
 And
 it's
 kind
 of


genetically
 determined.
 Females
 tend
 to


gain
 about
 their
 hips
 and
 thighs.
 Okay.


And
 actually
 that
 hip
 and
 thigh
 fat
 is


protective
 for
 cardiovascular
 disease
 in


a
 premenopausal
 women.
 Not
 in
 men
 but
 in


women.


>> And
 so
 it
 is
 so
 but
 when
 that
 fat
 shifts


to
 the
 intraabdominal
 cavity,
 it
 starts


that
 fat
 is
 metabolically
 active
 than


the
 fat
 under
 our
 skin
 and
 it
 creates


these
 pro-inflammatory
 cytoines.
 And


then
 you
 end
 up
 in
 this
 negative


feedback
 cycle
 of,
 you
 know,
 your
 liver


starts
 becoming
 dysfunctional,
 insulin


resistance
 increases,
 that
 drives
 more


fat
 to
 the
 visceral
 cavity,
 increases


inflammation,
 and
 it
 just
 goes
 on
 and
 on


and
 on.


>> So
 get
 liposuction.


>> No,
 no,
 no.
 You
 can't
 lipo
 the
 viscra


inside.
 That
 fat
 that's
 really
 inside


the
 abdominal
 cavity
 is
 what
 we're


talking
 about.
 That
 visceral
 fat,
 which


is
 the
 worst
 kind.


>> What
 about
 liposuction?
 Can't
 I
 just


suck
 it
 out?
 People
 are
 doing
 all
 kinds


with
 their


>> under
 the
 skin.
 Under
 the
 skin,
 you
 can.


That's
 an
 aesthetic
 decision.
 What
 was


the
 stuff
 under
 the
 skin?


>> Oh,


>> lipo
 suction
 it
 out.
 Is
 that
 a
 good
 idea


or
 a
 bad
 idea?


>> No,
 it'll
 come
 back.


>> All
 these
 things
 we're
 talking
 about,
 it


sounds
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 instructions,
 and


it
 is
 actually,
 but
 when
 you
 layer
 them


on,
 it
 becomes
 your
 lifestyle.
 It's
 not


a
 diet.
 It's
 not
 an
 exercise
 program.


It's
 just
 how
 I
 live.


>> Which
 brings
 me
 to
 my
 next
 question
 from


the
 audience,
 which
 is,
 what
 is
 the
 best


diet
 for
 a
 woman
 who
 is
 permenopausal?


plant
 forward,


>> plant
 heavy.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Because
 you're
 getting
 you're


getting
 So,
 when
 I'm
 talking
 to


patients,


>> we
 talk
 about
 the
 quality
 of
 their


nutrition.
 So,
 is
 your
 is
 your
 pattern


of
 eating
 I
 hate
 to
 call
 it
 diet
 because


it's
 four-letter
 word
 now,
 but
 is
 the


pattern
 that
 you're
 eating
 pro


pro-inflammatory
 or
 anti-inflammatory?


>> What's
 pro-inflammatory?


>> So,
 meaning
 the
 things
 that
 you
 put
 in


your
 body,
 are
 they
 likely
 to
 cause


inflammation?
 And
 we
 know
 there
 are


certain
 things
 that
 do
 that
 like
 heavily


ultrarocessed
 foods,
 you
 know,
 in
 large


amounts.
 Everybody
 can
 tolerate
 a
 little


bit
 of
 everything.
 But
 if
 the
 majority


of
 your
 diet,
 and
 for
 most
 Americans,


the
 majority
 of
 their
 diet
 is
 60%
 is


ultrarocessed
 foods.
 Okay.
 Those
 are
 by


and
 large
 plurinflammatory.


>> What
 about
 red
 meat?


>> Red
 meat
 in
 moderation
 and
 especially


leaner
 ones
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 a
 very


reliable
 source
 of
 protein.
 As
 far
 as


inflammation
 goes,
 it
 seems
 to
 be


neutral
 in
 small
 amounts,
 not
 heavily


like
 highfat
 meats
 or
 processed
 meats.


Then
 you're
 flipping
 over
 into


pro-inflammatory.


>> Is
 there
 a
 diet
 for
 fertility?


>> It's
 very
 much
 what
 we're
 saying
 right


here
 that
 plants
 have
 fiber
 that's
 going


to
 feed
 your
 gut
 microbiome
 that's
 going


to
 decrease
 inflammation.
 So
 fruits
 and


vegetables,
 getting
 enough
 fiber
 is
 the


number
 one
 change
 that
 most
 people
 need


to
 make.
 From
 there,
 we
 want
 to
 of


course
 decrease
 all
 your
 ultrarocessed


foods,
 healthy
 fats.
 Fat
 is
 the
 backbone


of
 chole
 like
 cholesterol
 is
 the


backbone
 of
 your
 steroid
 hormones.
 So
 if


you
 want
 to
 make
 hormones,
 we've
 got
 to


have
 some
 cholesterol,
 some
 healthy
 fats


coming
 in
 to
 provide
 the
 backbone
 for


that.
 That's
 essential.
 So
 things
 like


olive
 oil,
 nuts,
 your
 avocados,
 seeds,


these
 are
 going
 to
 provide
 some
 of
 those


healthier
 fats
 that
 are
 easier
 to
 use


for
 you.
 And
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 protein,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 protein


sources.
 We
 know
 that
 the
 the
 data
 is
 so


hard
 on
 nutrition
 because
 I
 can
 quote
 a


study
 that
 says
 for
 every
 serving
 of


plant
 protein
 that
 you
 take
 over
 animal


protein,
 you
 have
 a
 higher
 chance
 of


ovulating
 regularly.
 And
 that's
 true.
 A


lot
 of
 that
 though
 is
 nuanced
 by
 the


fact
 that
 people
 who
 eat
 plant-based


sources
 of
 proteins
 tend
 to
 eat
 other


plants
 in
 general
 and
 less
 ultrarocessed


foods
 than
 people
 have
 the
 highest


cortile
 of
 meat
 intake.
 If
 we
 go
 to
 a


micro
 level
 though,
 not
 all
 meat,
 animal


meat
 is
 created
 equal.
 Animal
 meat
 does


not
 have
 fiber
 in
 it.
 So
 we
 know
 it's


not
 feeding
 our
 gut
 microbiome.
 So
 if
 we


want
 to
 talk
 about
 carnivore
 diet,


things
 like
 that
 is
 definitely
 not


microbiome
 friendly
 for
 you
 and
 not


hormonally
 healthy.
 So
 we
 really
 want
 to


really
 have
 those
 whole
 foods,
 the


fruits,
 vegetables,
 the
 healthy
 fats,


the
 proteins
 that
 are
 going to
 be
 good


sources.
 And
 just
 like
 we
 talked
 about


other
 things,
 it's
 not
 all
 or
 nothing.


Red
 meat
 every
 day
 is
 probably
 going
 to


be
 inflammatory.
 Having
 it
 on
 the


weekend
 is
 probably
 okay.
 And
 the
 way
 I


describe
 this
 to
 patients
 is
 let's


imagine
 a
 scale
 where
 every
 decision
 you


make
 can
 kind
 of
 tick
 up
 the


inflammatory
 marker
 or
 bring
 it
 back


down.
 If
 you
 are
 making
 active
 decisions


that
 are
 more
 anti-inflammatory,


you
 can
 tolerate
 the
 glass
 of
 champagne,


the
 birthday
 cake,
 these
 little
 things


that
 we
 know
 will
 cause
 inflammation
 in


your
 body,
 but
 your
 body
 is
 meant
 to


respond
 to
 inflammation
 and
 get
 back
 to


normal.
 The
 problem
 is
 when
 it's


constantly
 challenged,
 when
 70%
 of
 the


things
 that
 you
 eat
 cause
 this
 chronic


inflammation
 inside
 of
 you,
 your
 body


can
 no
 longer
 respond
 appropriately
 when


it's
 challenged
 again.


>> Things
 that
 are
 pro-inflammatory
 tend
 to


also
 disrupt
 the
 gut
 microbiome.
 Tend
 to


like
 it
 all
 makes
 sense
 when
 you
 think


about
 it.


>> And
 there's
 quite
 a
 few
 studies
 that
 are


coming
 out
 in
 the
 four
 to
 five
 years


before
 the
 one
 point
 in
 time
 called


menopause.


So
 in
 late
 pmenopause
 that
 there's
 a


significant
 decrease
 in
 gut
 microbiome


digest.


>> Oh,
 Zoe
 did
 that
 work?


>> Yes.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 it's
 really
 interesting
 because
 of


the
 second
 pass
 and
 the
 way
 that


hormones
 are
 metabolized.
 When
 we
 have


uh
 our
 natural
 cycle
 and
 we
 have
 a
 an


exposure
 of
 our
 sex
 hormones,
 yeah,
 the


common
 cycle,
 then
 we
 have
 more
 of


diversity
 because
 the
 gut
 bugs
 help


unwind.
 I
 guess
 is
 that


>> so
 we
 metabolize
 estrogen
 into
 inactive


metabolites
 and
 then
 they
 get
 excreted


in
 the
 feces.
 So
 it
 goes
 through
 the


liver
 and
 then
 dumped
 into
 the
 bile.
 And


>> does
 that
 mean
 that
 if
 I
 if
 my


microbiome
 is
 likely
 to
 be
 less
 diverse


as
 I
 age,
 I
 need
 to
 be
 thinking
 more


about


>> the
 divers
 diversity
 of
 your
 plant


foods.
 And
 this
 is
 why
 it's
 really


>> probiotics,
 probiotics,
 etc.


>> Not
 over
 the
 counter.
 Okay,


>> you
 first
 start
 with
 food,
 but
 not
 a


pill
 that
 you're
 trying
 to
 take,
 but


actually
 the
 food
 that
 you're
 putting


into
 your
 body
 is
 the
 the
 best


fiber.


>> What
 about
 protein
 blunder?


>> The
 way
 I
 like
 to
 approach
 nutrition
 for


people
 is
 first
 having
 people
 notice


what
 they're
 eating
 and
 then
 from
 that


break
 it
 down
 into
 well,
 how
 much
 of
 it


is
 protein,
 how
 much
 it
 is
 fat,
 how
 much


is
 carbs.
 Without
 that
 kind
 of


education,
 it's
 almost
 meaningless.
 So


when
 we've
 done
 that
 and
 uh
 I'm
 making


recommen
 recommendations
 for
 protein,


we
 will
 not
 build
 the
 muscle
 we
 need
 to


build.
 We
 will
 not
 get
 stronger
 the
 way


we're
 capable
 of
 getting
 stronger.
 A
 if


we're
 not
 eating
 enough
 and
 B
 if
 we're


not
 taking
 enough
 protein.
 So
 the
 RDA


recommendations
 of8
 gram
 per
 kilogram
 is


survival
 doses
 of
 protein
 like
 sitting


on
 a
 chair
 like
 a
 mushroom


>> preventing
 malnutrition
 is
 the
 goal
 of


itable.


It
 is
 not
 for
 active
 people.
 It
 is
 not


for
 living
 your
 best
 life
 people


>> eight


>> the
 recommended
 daily
 intake


>> is8
 gram
 per
 kilogram
 of
 lean
 body
 mass.


>> So
 it's
 low


>> it's
 very
 low.
 So
 the
 research
 uh


supports
 easily
 supports


let's
 use
 pounds.86


grams
 per
 pound
 for
 lifting
 people.
 I


recommend
 over
 a
 gram.
 A
 gram
 for
 ideal


pound
 because


I'm
 presuming


that
 the
 people
 I'm
 taking
 care
 of
 are


going
 to
 start
 being
 active,
 that
 we're


trying
 to
 build
 muscle,
 that
 we're
 not


in
 starvation
 mode.


So
 0.8


grams
 per
 pound.


I
 recommend
 one


um
 gram
 per
 ideal
 pound.
 So
 there's
 some


other
 research
 that's
 come
 out
 looking


at
 skinny
 fat.
 So
 that's
 normal
 weight


obesity.
 So
 not
 as
 we're
 talking


>> normal
 BMI,


>> normal
 BMI,
 but
 internal
 high
 body
 fat.


>> And
 then
 at
 the
 And
 what
 happens
 is
 they


have
 low
 muscle
 mass.


>> Low
 muscle
 mass.
 So
 they
 took


>> a
 group
 of
 of
 women,
 split
 them
 up.
 So


you
 had
 a
 control
 group
 and
 then
 you
 had


this
 intervention
 group.
 And
 the
 only


change
 they
 made,
 there's
 no
 exercise,


and
 the
 only
 change
 they
 made
 was
 they


brought
 the
 intervention
 group
 up
 to
 1.6


grams
 of
 protein
 per
 kilogram.
 So


>> this
 is8
 per
 pound


>> and
 over
 the
 course
 of
 12
 weeks
 of


eating
 that
 protein
 intake,
 this


intervention
 group
 completely
 recmped


their
 body.
 So
 their
 muscle
 quality
 came


up,
 body
 fat
 went
 down.
 Control
 group,


of
 course,
 nothing
 happened.
 So
 it
 just


shows
 the
 importance
 of
 having
 that


higher
 protein
 intake
 just
 to
 support


basic
 muscle
 function
 and
 the
 frailty


data
 out
 of
 the
 WHI.
 So
 the
 women's


health
 initiative
 looked
 at
 multiple


things
 not
 just
 breast
 cancer
 and
 heart


disease
 but
 you
 know
 they
 followed
 these


women
 even
 off
 of
 HRT
 for
 decades.


>> Y


>> and
 when
 they
 looked
 at
 frailty
 scores


in
 the
 elderly
 and
 protein
 intake
 above


1.6
 six
 grams
 per
 kilogram


>> had
 the
 lowest
 frailty
 scores
 just
 based


on
 protein
 intake
 alone.


>> Yep.


>> What
 about
 fasting?
 I
 know
 so
 many


people
 that
 are
 doing
 water
 fasts
 and


juice
 fasts
 and
 it's
 impact.


>> Have
 they
 told
 you
 why?


>> I've
 had
 an
 evolution
 with
 the
 way
 I


think
 about
 fasting.
 um
 when
 I
 first


kind
 of
 you
 know
 was
 stepping
 out
 of
 the


box
 and
 what's
 happening
 in
 menopause


and
 why
 was
 my
 body
 composition
 I
 didn't


know
 what
 to
 call
 it
 back
 then
 but
 what


was
 all
 this
 going
 on
 that
 was
 new
 and


all
 my
 patients
 were
 having
 it
 as
 well


and
 these
 were
 my
 my
 girlfriends
 I


worked
 in
 a
 small
 town
 with
 a
 big


university
 and
 these
 were
 PhDs
 and
 we're


running
 marathons
 we're
 doing
 all
 this


stuff
 and
 everyone's
 kind
 of
 complaining


of
 the
 same
 thing
 and
 so
 fasting
 seemed


to
 be
 helpful
 and
 my
 girlfriends
 were


trying
 we
 all
 kind
 of
 did
 this
 fasting


thing
 and
 I
 was
 like
 super
 excited
 about


it
 everybody
 felt
 better
 blah
 blah
 blah


blah
 blah
 okay
 So,
 fast
 forward,
 I'm


learning
 more
 about
 hormones,
 body


composition,
 protein
 intake,
 all
 of


these
 needs.
 And
 suddenly,
 as
 I'm


counseling
 my
 patients,
 I'm
 realizing
 I


can't
 meet
 my
 own
 protein
 goals
 if
 I'm


trying
 to
 fast
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 And
 I


quickly
 realized
 if
 we're
 looking
 at


health
 span,
 if
 we're
 looking
 at
 body


composition,
 there
 may
 not
 be
 a
 lot
 of


room
 for
 fasting
 for
 these
 patients,
 you


know,
 or
 for
 my
 girlfriends,
 you
 know,


and
 it
 is
 really
 difficult
 for
 my


patients
 to
 reach
 their
 nutrition
 goals.


So,
 never
 at
 the
 expense
 of
 meeting
 your


basic
 nutrition
 goals
 and
 your
 calorie


needs.
 And
 it
 is
 really,
 really
 hard
 to


do
 while
 fasting.
 So,
 you
 may
 get
 a


short-term
 benefit
 with
 weight
 loss,


>> but
 there
 really
 doesn't.
 Now
 Dr.
 Sims


can
 get
 into
 the
 nitty-gritty
 of
 you


know


>> but
 the
 basic
 idea
 of
 fasting
 if
 we
 want


to
 use
 the
 term
 fasting
 we
 have
 to
 look


at
 it
 is
 are
 we
 talking
 about


intermittent
 fasting
 or
 timerestricted


eating.
 So
 intermittent
 fasting
 is
 kind


of
 like
 you
 know
 your
 water
 fast
 your


5day
 2day
 all
 that
 kind
 of
 crazy
 stuff


which
 for
 the
 most
 part
 men
 can
 get
 away


with
 and
 have
 a
 positive
 impact
 on
 body


composition
 but
 women
 can't.
 If
 we
 want


to
 talk
 about
 timerestricted
 eating
 and


working
 with
 our
 circadian
 rhythm,
 which


is
 optimal,
 then
 you
 have
 breakfast


within
 or
 food
 within
 a
 half
 an
 hour
 of


waking
 up
 that
 helps
 dampen
 that
 um


geroline
 and
 cortisol
 response
 I
 talked


about
 before
 so
 that
 everything
 is


coming
 down.
 Your
 hormones
 are
 starting


to
 work
 properly
 and
 your
 body's
 like


great,
 I'm
 ready
 to
 go.
 I
 can
 I
 can


handle
 this.
 And
 then
 you're
 eating
 at


regular
 intervals.
 And
 I
 try
 to
 have


people
 have
 protein
 and
 fiber
 at
 every


eating
 interval
 so
 that
 they
 are


maximizing
 protein
 and
 fiber
 intake.


Then
 you
 have
 dinner
 and
 then
 you
 don't


eat
 after
 dinner.


>> Every
 eating
 interval.


>> So
 breakfast,
 maybe
 you
 have
 a
 snack.
 If


we're
 looking
 at
 training
 or
 exercise,


if
 you're
 splitting
 your
 breakfast,
 then


you're
 having
 some
 protein
 and
 carb


before
 having
 the
 rest
 of
 your
 protein


or
 more
 protein
 afterwards.
 And
 then


you're
 having
 uh
 uh
 some
 protein
 and


some
 fiber
 at
 lunch.
 So
 you're
 having


maybe
 tempeh
 or
 tofu
 or
 salmon
 with


salad
 or
 fruit
 and
 veg.
 So
 every
 time


you're
 eating,
 you
 have
 a
 a
 protein
 and


fiber
 focus.


>> So
 timerestricted
 eating
 is
 within
 a


24-hour
 period.


>> So
 you're
 looking
 at
 I'm
 going
 to
 eat


during
 the
 day
 when
 my
 body
 needs
 it.


Yeah.


>> And
 I'm
 going
 to
 stop
 eating
 when
 I


finish
 dinner.
 So
 I
 have
 about
 a
 two


maybe
 three-hour
 break
 before
 I
 go
 to


bed.
 So
 that
 when
 I
 go
 to
 bed,
 I'm
 not


trying
 to
 digest
 food.
 my
 body
 can
 get


into
 the
 parasympathetic
 responses
 it


needs
 to
 to
 sleep
 well
 for
 reparation


>> and
 then
 I
 eat
 again
 at
 what
 time


>> when
 you
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning


>> it's
 typically
 about
 12
 hours
 of
 eating


and
 12
 hours
 of
 not
 so
 you're
 trying
 to


follow
 that
 circadian
 rhythm
 and
 work


with
 your
 hormones
 it
 can
 also
 when
 you


do
 have
 that
 period
 of
 time
 which
 maybe


that
 sounds
 very
 intuitive
 but
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 eating
 at
 1000
 p.m.
 they're


snacking
 on
 food,
 then
 they're
 trying
 to


go
 to
 bed,
 and
 then
 they're
 getting
 up.


When
 you
 give
 your
 body
 a
 little
 bit


longer,
 so
 at
 12
 hours
 time
 is
 when
 your


body
 will
 really
 efficiently
 be
 using
 up


all
 your
 glucose,
 really
 dropping
 some


of
 those
 insulin
 levels,
 but
 it's
 not
 so


much
 that
 it's
 stressful.
 And
 we're


using
 stress
 very
 generically
 here,
 but


on
 a
 cellular
 level,
 long
 periods
 of


fasting
 for
 women
 specifically
 can
 be


very
 stressful
 to
 the
 body.
 And
 that's


why
 if
 you
 think
 about
 Stacy's
 example


of
 what
 happened
 in
 two
 fasting
 periods


to,
 you
 know,
 a
 man
 and
 a
 woman,


different
 things
 are
 going
 to
 happen
 to


your
 body
 if
 it
 thinks
 it's
 being
 in


starvation.
 So,
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 put


your
 body
 in
 a
 starve
 state.
 We're
 just


trying
 to
 give
 it
 a
 time
 period
 without


food
 so
 that
 it
 can
 start
 to
 process
 the


energy
 that's
 available
 differently.


>> Why?
 Why
 not,
 though?
 What's
 going
 to


happen?
 And
 I
 understand
 from
 what
 we


talked
 about
 earlier
 that
 my
 fertility


my
 my
 cycle
 is
 going
 to
 change.


>> But
 is
 that


>> well
 there's
 there's
 adaptive
 stress
 and


then
 there's
 stress
 to
 the
 point
 of


you're
 you're
 hurting
 yourself.


>> Men
 can
 you
 said
 that
 men
 can
 do
 longer


fasts.


>> They
 can
 they
 can
 do
 longer
 fasts
 and
 it


can
 show
 to
 actually
 you
 know
 be


something
 that
 might
 be
 advantageous
 for


them
 for
 how
 their
 body
 is
 made.
 Might


increase
 their
 focus
 and
 some
 other


metrics.
 But
 for
 women,
 these
 longer


periods
 are
 actually
 going
 to
 promote


more
 visceral
 fat
 storage
 and
 become


pro-inflammatory.


And
 you
 said
 it
 a
 little
 casually,
 but


disrupting
 your
 hypothalamus
 and


shutting
 off
 your
 hormone
 system
 will


cause
 a
 low
 estrogen
 state.
 And
 that's


very
 problematic
 as
 we've
 talked
 about.


So
 thinking
 about
 your
 body
 should
 not


be
 in
 a
 starved
 state.
 So
 utilizing


timerestricted
 eating
 meaning
 I'm
 going


to
 eat
 within
 my
 circadian
 rhythm
 the


hours
 that
 there
 is
 sun
 outside
 back


what
 how
 your
 body
 is
 made
 to
 function


is
 working
 with
 your
 biology.
 If
 you're


saying
 I'm
 going
 to
 not
 eat
 for
 3
 days


because
 I'm
 doing
 this
 fasting
 period


for
 women
 that's
 going
 to
 induce
 a


stressful
 state
 where
 you're
 going
 to


start
 to
 store
 more
 as
 visceral
 fat
 and


cause
 more
 inflammation.
 And
 if
 we
 bring


it
 into
 the,
 you
 know,
 people
 holding
 a


fast
 till
 noon
 or
 after
 you're
 phase


shifting.
 So
 it's
 like
 you're
 having


social
 jet
 lag
 where
 if
 you're
 phase


shifting
 your
 hormone
 responses,
 your


appetite
 hormones,
 then
 you're
 not
 going


to
 get
 into
 a
 good
 sleep
 because
 your


body
 is
 like
 it's
 not
 time
 to
 go
 to


sleep.
 Your
 melatonin
 peak
 in
 women


usually
 peaks
 around
 9:00.
 So
 you
 start


to
 get
 sleepy.
 That
 gets
 shifted
 to
 11,


12.
 So
 you're
 not
 actually
 going
 to
 get


good
 sleep
 because
 you
 now
 have
 reset


your
 melatonin
 responses.
 So
 we
 want


women
 to
 understand
 that
 timerestricted


eating
 when
 you're
 not
 eating
 when
 in


the
 dark
 is
 really
 beneficial.


>> Easiest
 way
 to
 say
 it.


>> Easiest
 way
 to
 say
 it.
 Yeah.
 You're


fueling
 for
 your
 body
 during
 the
 day


because
 that's
 when
 it
 needs
 the
 fuel.


That's
 when
 we
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 create


uh
 an
 environment
 that's
 supportive
 to


hormone
 health,
 supportive
 to
 muscle


growth,
 to
 brain
 health,
 to
 all
 the


things
 and
 reducing
 stress
 when
 we
 can


control
 that
 stress.
 So
 when
 you
 start


phase
 shifting
 and
 holding
 fast
 and


creating
 this
 stress
 on
 a
 circadian


level
 knowing
 that
 there's
 a
 circadian


response
 on
 every
 cell
 as
 well
 as
 a


total
 body
 circadian
 rhythm
 that
 if
 you


shift
 that
 then
 we
 start
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of


metabolic
 dysfunction
 poor
 sleep
 and


unfortunately
 we
 see
 this
 in
 shift


workers
 because
 that's
 what's
 happening.


They're
 having
 circadian
 shift


>> and
 they
 have
 significantly
 lower


longevity.
 They
 live
 what?
 I
 I
 think
 I


heard
 14
 years
 less
 if
 you're
 working


night
 shifts.


>> I
 don't
 know.


>> You
 have
 higher
 rates
 of
 infertility,


higher
 rates
 of
 pregnancy
 loss.
 You


you're
 more
 metabolically
 unhealthy.
 Of


course,
 we're
 generalizing
 a
 group
 of


people.
 And
 sometime
 I
 think
 we've
 all


had
 moments
 of
 time
 of
 life
 where
 shift


work
 was
 part
 of
 what
 we
 had
 to
 do.
 But


night
 shift
 work,
 most
 people
 are
 not


getting
 enough
 sleep
 during
 the
 day
 and


they're
 what
 we
 call
 flipping
 back
 and


forth,
 right?
 because
 you
 want
 to
 be
 on


a
 daytime
 schedule
 on
 your
 off
 days
 and


live
 your
 life
 that
 you're
 constantly


sacrificing
 what
 your
 body
 needs.
 And


what
 I
 tell
 people
 is
 you
 may
 if
 you
 can


get
 off
 of
 that,
 it
 it
 will
 be
 a


healthier
 life
 pattern.
 But
 in
 moments


where
 it's
 not,
 you
 need
 to
 really


prioritize
 trying
 to
 get
 enough
 sleep,


making
 sure
 that
 you're
 taking
 care
 of


yourself
 in
 the
 other
 time
 periods


because
 you're
 set
 up
 for
 a
 place
 that


is
 going
 to
 cause
 hormone
 dysfunction


and
 impact
 your
 metabolic
 health.


>> Mhm.


>> You
 believe
 the
 same.
 I
 believe


>> I
 uh
 advocate
 uh
 feeding
 ourselves
 for


optimum
 health.
 To
 be
 any
 kind
 of


active,
 you
 must
 feed
 yourself.
 and
 um


stop
 eating
 three
 time
 3
 hours
 before


bed.


>> So,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 of
 people
 that
 do


these
 longer
 fasts?
 Do
 you
 think
 that


they've
 just
 been
 given
 poor
 advice?


Because
 I
 know
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 Mel


and
 I
 know
 she
 does
 frequently
 does


three-day
 fasts


>> because
 I
 think
 people
 think
 they've


heard
 this
 term
 autophagy.


>> Autophagy
 is
 the
 term.


>> Take
 it
 Stacy.


>> So,
 this
 is
 the
 thing
 with
 autophagy.


>> You
 get
 that
 with
 exercise.
 So
 the
 idea


of
 autophagy
 is
 recycling
 the
 some
 of


the
 parts
 of
 cells
 that
 have
 broken
 down


or
 somehow
 become
 dysfunctional.
 So
 your


body's
 really
 good
 at
 cleaning
 that
 out.


We
 see
 with
 exercise,
 it
 invokes
 that


autophagy.
 With
 fasting,
 it
 invokes
 that


too,
 but
 not
 the
 severe
 fasting
 like


three-day
 fast,
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 When


we're
 looking
 at
 the
 telomeir
 changes


that
 people
 say
 with
 fasting,
 you
 get


that
 with
 exercise.
 So
 telomeir
 is
 um


points
 that
 we
 look
 on
 the
 DNA
 to
 see


how
 you're
 aging.
 So
 we
 want
 longer


telomeir
 length
 because
 that
 means
 you


are
 more
 stress
 resilient.
 You
 get
 that


with
 exercise
 cuz
 exercise
 is
 a
 big


stress.
 It
 creates
 a
 a
 change
 within


like
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 before.
 Yeah.


Adaptive
 stress,
 epigenetic
 changes


which
 improves
 all
 of
 those
 markers
 that


people
 are
 so
 adamant
 fasting
 does.


>> What
 about
 fasting
 and
 then
 doing


exercise?
 So
 fasted
 exercise
 is
 that


>> for
 women?
 No.
 That's
 what
 she
 taught


me.


>> For
 men,
 it
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 no
 as
 well


because
 when
 we're
 looking
 at
 the


fueling
 mechanics
 of
 exercise,
 muscle
 is


a
 very
 metabolically
 active
 tissue.


>> If
 your
 body
 is
 trying
 to
 fuel
 itself,


it's
 going
 to
 break
 down
 the
 very
 first


thing
 that's
 creating
 a
 energetic
 need,


which
 is
 muscle.
 We
 see
 in
 women,
 women,


>> you're
 going
 to
 lose
 muscle.


>> You're
 going
 to
 break
 it
 down
 and
 use


the
 amino
 acids
 as
 fuel.
 You
 can
 tap


into
 blood
 glucose
 and
 some
 fat,
 but


when
 you
 aren't
 bringing
 blood
 glucose


up
 through
 eating
 first,
 it's
 really


hard
 for
 your
 body
 to
 understand
 that


this
 is
 what
 you
 want
 it
 to
 do.
 So,
 it's


like,
 okay,
 I
 need
 to
 conserve
 fat.
 I'm


I
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 through
 all
 the


glucose
 that
 I
 have
 because
 I
 need
 it


for
 brain
 health.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 start


feeding
 more
 amino
 acids
 in
 to
 fuel
 what


I'm
 doing.


>> For
 women,
 we
 already
 use
 more
 amino


acid
 than
 men.
 So,
 if
 we're
 looking
 at


fasted
 training,
 then
 we're
 already


increasing
 the
 amount
 of
 lean
 mass
 that


our
 body
 is
 going
 to
 break
 down
 to
 use


as
 fuel.


>> I'm
 pretty
 sure
 it
 was
 you
 that
 told
 me


there's
 this
 part
 of
 the
 brain
 that's


kind
 of
 checking
 if
 there's
 energy
 in


our
 blood,
 if
 there's
 glucose
 in
 our


blood.


>> That's
 part
 of
 our
 hypothalamus.


>> And
 so,
 the
 hypothalamus
 is
 this
 sensor


that's
 kind
 of
 checking.
 And
 in
 a
 woman,


again,
 correct
 me
 when
 I
 butcher
 this,


but
 if
 it
 understands
 that
 there's
 no


glucose
 in
 the
 blood,
 then
 it's
 going
 to


go
 into
 that
 survival
 state,
 which
 is


going
 to
 start
 to
 shut
 things
 down,


>> which
 means
 growth
 of
 muscle
 isn't
 going


to
 be
 possible.


>> Um,
 because
 once
 upon
 a
 time,
 I
 guess


that
 stress
 without
 the
 fuel
 would
 have


been
 a
 threat,
 especially
 in
 the
 context


of
 like
 my
 menstrual
 cycle
 and
 my


reproductive
 health.


>> That's
 a
 good
 way
 of
 of
 wrapping
 it
 up.


Yeah.
 It's
 not
 that
 we
 don't
 have
 blood


glucose,
 it's
 low
 blood
 glucose
 and
 no


nutrients
 coming
 in
 that
 the


hypothalamus
 is
 sensing.
 So,
 we're


looking
 at
 neuropeptide
 responses
 within


the
 brain
 within
 the
 hypothalamus
 that


controls
 appetite
 hormone
 uh
 the
 way


that
 your
 body's
 using
 fuel.
 So,
 if
 we


don't
 have
 stuff
 coming
 in,
 the


hypothalamus
 is
 like,
 "Oh,
 wait
 a


second.
 What's
 going
 on
 here?"
 Is
 it


fair
 to
 say
 the
 woman's
 body
 is
 more
 I


was
 going
 to
 say
 stubborn
 but
 that's
 a


slightly
 negative
 word
 less
 flexible


>> than
 than
 a
 man's


>> more
 complex
 complex
 it's
 complex
 and


more
 stress
 defend
 itself


>> it's
 very
 much
 stress
 resilient
 so
 it's


very
 defendable


>> it's
 trying
 to
 protect
 you
 it
 really
 is


looking
 at
 how
 what
 is
 it
 going
 to
 do
 to


keep
 your
 functions
 happening
 balance
 in


balance
 but
 because
 women
 can
 get


pregnant
 and
 pregnancy
 is
 not
 a
 health


neutral
 state
 it's
 a
 huge
 strain
 on
 the


body


>> that
 is
 an
 extra
 layer
 of
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 sometimes
 decides
 I'm
 going


to
 put
 this
 to
 your
 side
 because
 I'm


going
 to


>> to
 protect


>> keep
 you
 functioning.
 I
 want
 to
 work
 on


all
 of
 our
 other
 body
 functions.
 We're


going
 to
 shut
 off
 that
 side
 that's
 not


sending
 out
 FSH
 and
 LH
 and
 making


reproductive
 hormones
 cuz
 we
 can't


afford
 to
 keep
 you
 healthy.
 Then
 we


definitely
 can't
 afford
 to
 grow
 a
 baby


and
 keep
 you
 healthy.
 If
 you
 are


pregnant
 and
 go
 through
 times
 of
 severe


stress,
 illness,
 injury,


your
 body
 will
 eject


what
 is
 in
 the
 womb
 through
 a


miscarriage
 or,
 you
 know,
 early


pregnancy
 loss
 or
 mis
 or
 preterm
 labor


because
 it
 is
 always
 going
 to
 try
 to


protect
 you
 first.


>> So,
 you're
 at
 high
 risk
 of
 a
 failed


pregnancy.


I
 wonder
 if
 I
 could
 frame
 Mel's
 your


question
 about
 Mel
 and
 the
 way
 I
 I
 frame


all
 the
 advice
 whether
 it's
 research


advice
 or
 internet
 advice
 is
 you
 have
 to


know
 what
 your
 goal
 is.
 What
 is
 Mel's


goal
 or
 your
 goal
 or
 because
 listen


they're
 exclusive
 longevity
 if
 longevity


is
 your
 goal
 like
 live
 longer
 at
 any


cost
 well
 then
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 research


about
 severe
 calorie
 restriction
 and


lifestyle
 and
 just
 lots
 of
 severe
 ways


to
 live.


Okay,
 if
 that's
 longevity
 is
 your
 goal


that's
 your
 goal.
 If
 your
 goal
 is
 peak


performance
 like
 a
 pro
 alete,


that
 is
 a
 different
 kind
 of
 life
 and


training
 and
 reps
 and
 peak
 performance


at
 the
 pro
 level
 doesn't
 necessarily
 get


you
 longevity.
 Proathletes
 live
 less,
 at


least
 contact
 athletes
 live
 less
 than


people
 focus
 on
 longevity.
 But
 the
 third


bucket
 that
 most
 of
 us
 live
 in
 is
 health


span
 and
 wellness.
 It's
 neither
 high


performance
 live
 less
 time.
 And
 it's


neither
 austerity
 live
 the
 longest


possible.
 It
 is
 the
 middle
 ground.
 It's


the
 homeostasis
 balance.
 And
 so
 when


questions
 like
 that
 come
 up,
 the
 first


question
 in
 my
 mind
 is
 which
 bucket
 are


you
 in?
 Are
 you
 in
 a
 peak
 performance?


You're
 going to
 do
 different
 kind
 of


training,
 different
 kind
 of
 eating.
 We


know
 you
 may
 have
 a
 decreased
 lifespan


because
 of
 the
 stress
 you
 put
 on
 versus


this.
 So,
 what
 are
 we
 working
 for?


>> I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 people
 that
 talk


about
 these
 fasts
 often
 say
 to
 me,


especially
 when
 they're
 referring
 to


juice
 fasts
 that
 it's
 kind
 of
 like


cleaning
 out
 the
 system.


>> They
 say
 it's
 like
 it's
 like
 cleaning


house.


>> You
 don't
 need
 to
 clean
 out
 your
 That's


not
 how
 you
 clean
 out
 your
 system.


>> Taking
 the
 fiber
 out
 of
 those
 fruits
 and


vegetables,


>> taking
 away
 all
 the
 things
 that
 you


need.


>> Juice
 is
 500
 calories
 of
 pure
 glucose.


>> Yeah.


>> What
 if
 it's
 vegetable
 juicing?


Why
 not
 just
 eat
 the
 vegetables
 and
 get


the
 fiber
 for
 your
 gut?


>> But
 you
 have
 a
 liver.
 Your
 liver.


>> I
 think
 it's
 marketing.
 I
 think
 they're


falling
 prey
 to
 marketing.
 And
 that's
 a


big
 wellness
 trend.


>> I
 know.
 But
 it's
 it's
 massive.
 Honestly,


you
 would.
 Yeah.
 I
 know
 so
 many
 people,


so
 many
 of
 my
 best
 friends


>> going
 on
 detox
 wellness
 retreats.


>> Well,
 even
 when
 I
 ask
 them
 why
 they're


doing
 a
 water
 fast,
 they
 say,
 "I'm
 just


detoxing."
 Or
 when
 I
 ask
 them
 why


they're
 grinding
 up
 this
 fruit
 and


vegetable
 and,
 as
 you
 say,
 pulling
 out


all
 the
 fiber
 from
 it.
 It
 feels
 more


attainable
 to
 say,
 I'm
 doing
 this
 crazy


thing
 for
 3
 days,
 then
 I'm
 going
 to
 make


a
 life
 switch
 to
 just
 live
 a
 more


preventive
 anti-inflammatory
 lifestyle.


>> Before
 the
 Diario
 was
 what
 it
 is
 today,


it
 was
 just
 an
 idea.
 And
 it
 started
 with


me,
 a
 cheap
 plug-in
 microphone,
 and
 my


Mac
 right
 here.
 And
 I
 have
 to
 say
 when
 I


first
 had
 the
 idea
 for
 the
 diary
 of
 a


CEO,
 my
 thinking
 was
 that
 the
 world


might
 want
 to
 see
 into
 the
 diaries
 of


some
 of
 the
 most
 interesting,
 successful


people
 really
 in
 high
 places
 that
 were


doing
 interesting
 things.
 So
 after


recording
 that
 first
 episode
 under
 my


duvet,
 I
 sat
 on
 my
 Mac
 by
 our
 sponsor


Apple
 and
 spent
 hours
 editing
 on
 Garage


Band
 and
 eventually
 uploaded
 it
 and


honestly
 I
 thought
 that
 would
 probably


be
 it.
 But
 a
 couple
 of
 my
 friends
 said


they
 enjoyed
 it,
 so
 I
 kept
 on
 recording.


And
 over
 time,
 the
 microphone
 has


changed
 and
 we
 now
 have
 this
 incredible


setup
 here.
 But
 the
 thing
 that
 has


stayed
 the
 same
 is
 I'm
 still
 using
 the


Mac.
 Even
 today,
 my
 entire
 team
 across


our
 studio
 still
 uses
 the
 Mac.
 Our
 first


few
 episodes
 maybe
 had
 tens
 of
 people


listening,
 but
 now
 tens
 of
 millions
 of


people
 tune
 in
 all
 over
 the
 world,
 which


is
 still
 absolutely
 crazy
 to
 me.
 So,
 if


there
 is
 an
 idea
 that
 keeps
 tapping
 you


on
 the
 shoulder,
 this
 is
 your
 sign
 to


start.
 Your
 great
 ideas
 start
 on
 Mac
 and


you
 can
 find
 out
 more
 at
 apple.com/mack.


Have
 you
 ever
 heard
 about
 this
 before?


This
 thing
 I'm
 holding
 in
 my
 hands
 now.


This
 is
 called
 Ketone
 IQ.
 The
 website
 is


ketone.com.
 You've
 heard
 me
 on
 this


podcast
 talking
 about
 the
 fact
 that
 I


stay
 much
 of
 the
 year
 in
 a
 ketogenic


state,
 which
 is
 a
 highly
 restricted


diet.
 And
 the
 reason
 I
 do
 that
 is


plenty.
 One
 of
 them
 is
 I
 spend
 hours
 and


hours
 talking
 to
 people
 for
 a
 living.
 So


I
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 my
 brain
 is
 firing


in
 an
 optimal
 way.
 And
 the
 other
 reason


that
 I
 do
 the
 ketogenic
 diet
 is
 because


I
 just
 feel
 better.
 So
 when
 I
 discovered


this,
 which
 is
 what
 they
 call
 an


exogenous
 ketone
 product
 where
 you
 can


drink
 it
 and
 it
 increases
 your
 blood's


ketone
 levels,
 I
 was
 blown
 away.
 I


contacted
 them,
 I
 met
 them,
 I
 invested


extremely
 heavily
 into
 their
 company
 and


I've
 become
 a
 co-owner
 of
 the
 company


accordingly
 and
 they
 sponsor
 this
 show


now.
 So
 if
 you
 want
 to
 try
 this
 out
 for


yourself,
 I
 recommend
 you
 try
 it.
 Just


visit
 ketone.com/stephven


and
 you'll
 get
 30%
 off
 your
 first


subscription
 order.
 You'll
 also
 get
 a


free
 gift
 with
 your
 second
 shipment.


That's
 ketone.com/stephven.


And
 in
 terms
 of
 supplements
 generally,


do
 you
 know,
 again,
 not
 to
 bring
 Melon


to
 this
 for
 the
 thousandth
 time
 today,


but
 a
 couple
 of
 um
 couple
 of
 Christmases


ago,
 I
 told
 her
 that
 she
 should
 be


having
 creatine
 because
 I
 all
 these


people
 on
 my
 podcast
 told
 me
 it
 and
 she


said,
 "No,
 it's
 for
 bodybuilders."
 Yeah,


that's
 the
 old
 school
 thought.
 When


we're
 thinking
 about
 creatine
 and
 how
 it


got
 its
 chops
 in
 the
 supplement
 world,


we're
 looking
 at
 muscle
 performance
 and


taking
 five
 grams
 four
 times
 a
 day
 with


some
 carbohydrate
 to
 enhance
 muscle


performance
 is
 how
 it
 started.
 But
 when


you
 start
 really
 disseminating
 down
 into


the
 health
 aspects
 of
 creatine,
 creatine


is
 used
 in
 every
 fast
 energetic
 of
 the


body.
 So
 that
 means
 your
 brain,
 your


heart,
 your
 gut,
 muscle,
 everything
 that


requires
 energy
 from
 0
 to
 30
 seconds,


creatine
 is
 involved.
 Women
 have
 about


70
 80%
 of
 the
 stores
 of
 men.
 And
 when
 we


start
 looking
 at
 all
 the
 different
 types


of
 diets
 that
 are
 out
 there,
 lots
 of


exclusionary
 food
 diets,
 then
 the
 intake


of
 creatine
 is
 lower.
 What
 we're
 finding


in
 the
 research
 from
 health
 perspective


is
 that
 it
 does
 so
 many
 positive
 things


when
 you're
 able
 to
 saturate
 the
 tissues


to
 bring
 it
 up
 with
 even
 a
 small
 dose
 of


3
 to
 five
 grams
 a
 day.
 Our
 liver
 makes


about
 three,
 but
 we
 don't
 necessarily


eat
 enough
 to
 help
 supplement
 all
 of
 the


tissues.


>> How
 much
 would
 it
 take?
 Like
 12
 chicken


breasts
 or
 something?


>> 22.


>> Okay.


>> 22
 chicken
 breast.
 A
 lot.
 So
 when
 we


look
 at
 the
 supplementation
 and
 being


able
 to
 saturate
 all
 of
 our
 tissues


thoroughly
 to
 support
 those
 fast


energetics,
 we
 see
 things
 like
 better


cognition
 focus.
 We
 see
 a
 faster


recovery
 from
 small
 brain
 traumatic
 like


a
 friend's
 daughter
 hit
 her
 head
 on
 the


um
 the
 laundry
 door
 of
 the
 dryer
 and
 got


a
 TBI
 or
 a
 small
 concussion
 from
 that,


started
 using
 creatine,
 came
 out
 of
 it
 a


lot
 faster.
 I
 mean,
 there
 are
 things


that
 help
 with
 brain
 metatasm.
 We
 see


women
 who
 have
 incidences
 with
 IBS
 or


gut
 issues
 and
 they're
 using
 creatine.


It
 helps
 decrease
 the
 symptomology.


We're
 seeing
 now
 studies
 coming
 out


about
 fatigue.
 And
 this
 is
 where
 the
 38


g
 per
 kilogram
 of
 body
 weight
 or
 the


equivalent
 of
 20
 gram
 if
 you're
 60
 kilos


helps
 with
 fatigue
 and
 focus.
 Especially


if
 you're
 under
 a
 lot
 of
 high
 stress.


Because
 if
 you're
 under
 a
 lot
 of
 high


stress,
 your
 body's
 going
 through
 a
 lot


of
 blood
 glucose
 trying
 to
 keep
 up
 with


that
 stress.
 So
 creatine
 isn't
 just
 the


bodybuilding
 set.
 There's
 so
 many


different
 health
 benefits
 and
 it
 keeps


coming
 out
 with
 more
 and
 more
 research


to
 show
 how
 beneficial
 creatine
 is.


>> Could
 you
 give
 me
 the
 menopause


supplements,
 if
 there
 is
 such
 a


>> Okay,
 so
 in
 general,
 um,
 we're
 not
 going


to
 cure
 menopause
 with
 supplements.
 Let


me
 just
 take
 straight
 up.
 Okay.
 Most


women
 are
 going
 to
 be
 deficient
 in
 fiber


and
 most
 women
 are
 going
 to
 be
 deficient


in
 vitamin
 D.
 And
 vitamin
 D
 is
 hugely


important
 in
 multiple
 enzyatic
 processes


in
 our
 body.
 And
 it's
 really
 hard
 to
 get


enough
 through
 our
 nutrition,
 even


eating
 stacks
 of
 salmon
 a
 day,
 which
 is


really
 high
 in
 vitamin
 D.
 So
 about
 80%


of
 my
 patients
 are
 not
 only
 just
 low
 in


vitamin
 D,
 they're
 deficient.
 So,
 that


is
 one
 that
 we
 can
 supplement
 safely
 up


to
 about
 4,000
 IUs
 international
 units


is
 how
 vitamin
 D
 is
 measured
 a
 day


without
 worries
 of
 becoming
 toxic
 or


having
 too
 much
 vitamin
 D,
 which
 is


possible.
 And
 so,
 usually
 I'm
 having


creatine.
 Absolutely.
 It's
 like
 a
 go-to.


And
 we're
 looking
 at
 her
 nutritional


profile.
 We're
 looking
 at
 her
 fiber


intake.
 And
 then
 we're
 adding
 in
 a
 fiber


supplement
 if
 she
 needs
 it.


>> Natalie,
 in
 terms
 of
 fertility,
 what
 is


the
 fertility
 supplement
 stack,


>> Percy?
 And
 first
 and
 foremost,
 we're


going
 to
 say
 that
 if
 you
 are
 trying
 to


get
 pregnant,
 which
 by
 asking
 fertility,


we're
 going
 to
 presume,
 we
 want
 to
 make


sure
 you
 have
 folic
 acid
 on
 board.
 So


folic
 acid
 is
 the
 essential
 component,


one
 very
 important
 part
 in
 cell


division,
 but
 it's
 essential
 for
 a
 baby


when
 it
 comes
 to
 brain
 development
 and


spinal
 cord
 development.
 We
 call
 these


neural
 tube
 defects.
 And
 the
 reason
 why


I'm
 bringing
 it
 up
 is
 that
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 chatter
 about
 folic
 acid
 out
 there,


but
 it
 is
 the
 only
 supplement
 folic
 acid


in
 its
 folic
 acid
 form
 that
 is
 proven
 to


prevent
 these
 neural
 tube
 defects
 such


as
 your
 baby
 being
 born
 without
 a
 brain.


And
 interestingly,
 in
 today's
 world,
 a


lot
 of
 foods
 are
 also
 fortified
 with


folic
 acid.
 But
 these
 are
 some
 foods


that
 are
 often
 processed
 and
 people
 are


consuming
 less.
 So
 we
 are
 having
 less


consumption
 of
 folic
 acid
 in
 our
 diet.


Therefore
 making
 it
 even
 more
 important


that
 we
 are
 supplementing
 with
 folic


acid.
 As
 Dr.
 Haver
 said,
 vitamin
 D,


vitamin
 D
 is
 essential
 for
 your
 entire


body.
 But
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 hormone


metabolism
 and
 fertility
 as
 well,
 we


even
 see
 women
 who
 are
 going
 through
 IVF


with
 donor
 eggs
 and
 we
 know
 they're
 very


good
 quality,
 have
 lower
 success
 rates


if
 they
 have
 lower
 vitamin
 D
 levels.


This
 is
 something
 that
 almost
 everybody


is
 deficient
 in.
 We
 do
 test
 and
 then


target
 treatment
 to
 try
 to
 get
 you
 to
 an


optimal
 level.
 But
 also
 omega-3
 fatty


acids
 are
 really
 important
 in
 your


entire
 body,
 but
 especially
 in
 your


reproductive
 years
 if
 you
 might
 get


pregnant.
 And
 I
 often
 recommend


magnesium
 for
 most
 patients
 as
 well.
 And


then
 from
 a
 fertility
 standpoint,
 if
 you


have
 infertility,
 there
 are
 studies
 that


show
 that
 co-enzyme
 Q10
 can
 be
 highly


beneficial
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 egg
 quality.


This
 is
 important
 in
 our
 mitochondrial


health.
 And
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 the
 one


question
 you
 asked,
 remember
 when
 we


talked
 about
 eggs,
 we've
 got
 our
 genetic


health,
 which
 is
 largely
 dependent
 on


age.
 We
 have
 our
 metabolic
 health.
 The


mitochondria
 from
 the
 egg
 controls
 all


development
 for
 the
 embryo.
 And
 in
 fact,


the
 cellular
 functions
 for
 an
 embryo,


the
 first
 three
 days
 of
 life,
 solely


come
 from
 the
 egg.
 The
 male
 genome


doesn't
 even
 kick
 in
 until
 day
 three
 of


embryo
 life.
 So
 the
 function
 of
 the
 egg


to
 be
 able
 to
 divide
 and
 do
 normal
 cell


functions
 is
 very
 important.
 And


sometimes
 we
 see
 that
 reduced
 in


infertility
 patients
 and
 co-enzyme
 Q10


is
 an
 easy
 thing
 we
 can
 get
 over
 the


counter.
 Doesn't
 appear
 to
 have
 any


harmful
 side
 effects
 and
 has
 potential


benefits
 in
 some
 subsets.
 So
 my


infertility
 patients
 I
 add
 that
 on.


>> Wonder
 all
 things


>> aging,
 performance,
 strength,
 bone.


>> Mhm.


>> What
 is
 the
 supplement
 stack
 for
 for


longevity?
 vitamin
 D,
 magnesium
 is


critically
 important
 for
 a
 variety
 of
 uh


metabolic
 functions.
 Omega-3
 for


anti-inflammation,


creatine,
 I'm
 a
 big
 fan
 of.
 If
 we
 move


looking
 at
 uh
 scinesscent
 cell
 load
 and


inflammation,
 we
 haven't
 really
 talked


about
 longevity,
 but
 scinsesscent
 cells


are
 those
 B
 those
 cells
 left
 over
 from


normal
 function
 that
 are
 so
 damaged
 that


they
 can't
 flip
 into
 programmed
 cell


death.
 So
 they
 circulate
 around
 and


produce
 noxious
 um
 chemicals
 that
 can


lead
 to
 a
 variety
 of
 disease.
 So
 we
 want


to
 minimize
 those
 and
 one
 way
 to
 do
 it


is
 lifestyle.
 Another
 way
 is
 to
 use
 an


herb
 called
 fiseten.
 So
 I
 add
 that
 on


and
 then
 also
 I
 do
 myself
 and
 check


levels
 on
 my
 people
 of
 intracellular


NAD+.
 NAD
 is
 a
 co-enzyme
 in
 300


metabolic
 reactions.
 It's
 an
 it's
 an
 uh


an
 energetic
 pathway.
 Now,
 it's
 very


popular
 right
 now.
 And
 the
 critical


differentiator
 for
 me
 is
 that
 taking


whole
 molecule
 NAD
 such
 as
 in
 IVs,
 our


body
 needs
 to
 make
 it.
 So
 for
 myself
 and


for
 my
 people,
 I
 supplement
 with
 NMN,


which
 is
 the
 immediate
 precursor
 of
 NAD+


so
 that
 my
 body
 can
 then
 turn
 it
 into


NAD+
 and
 it
 can
 work
 intracellularly.
 It


can
 also
 be
 delivered
 two
 reactions
 out


uh
 in
 the
 form
 of
 NR.
 These
 are
 in
 the
 B


vitamin
 categories.
 So
 that
 in
 two


reactions
 your
 body
 makes
 NAD+.
 So


the
 data
 does
 not
 show
 that
 you
 can
 IV


NAD+
 for
 ac
 efficacy
 cuz
 it
 works


intracellularly.
 So
 you
 supplement
 its


precursor.


>> I've
 heard
 so
 many
 people
 talking
 about


NMN
 recently.


>> Yes,
 that's
 right.
 That's
 what
 I'm


talking
 about.


>> Is
 there
 clinical
 evidence
 to
 show
 that


it's
 effective?
 So
 you
 know
 those
 the


lab
 that
 I
 work
 with
 uh
 I
 happen
 to
 know


the
 scientist
 and
 he
 has
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 of
 data
 points
 checking
 before


NAD+
 levels
 intracellularly


supplementing
 and
 then
 after
 and
 he
 can


elevate
 those
 levels


>> and
 it's
 associated
 with
 longevity
 like


intrinsically
 associated
 with
 longevity


a
 lot
 of
 the
 the
 bro
 science
 I
 guess


longevity


>> well
 it's
 intrinsic
 intrinsically


related
 to
 lots
 of
 normal
 metabolic


function
 and
 uh
 energy
 in
 the
 body.


Whether
 or
 not
 it
 makes
 you
 live
 longer,


I
 don't
 have
 that
 data.


>> Is
 it
 a
 tablet?


>> It
 is
 a
 powder
 the
 way
 I
 take
 it.


>> Mhm.


>> What
 about
 collagen?
 People
 talk
 a
 lot


about
 collagen.
 It's
 in
 all
 the
 protein


powders
 now.


>> I
 know,
 but
 it's
 not
 a
 protein
 as
 we


think
 about
 it.
 Like
 you'll
 see
 all


these
 collagen
 protein.
 It
 doesn't
 count


as
 dietary
 protein
 for
 muscle


development.


>> Does
 it
 work
 as
 a
 supplement?


>> There
 depends
 on
 what
 you're
 looking


for.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 and
 Mike
 Orsby
 out
 of
 um


University
 of
 Southern
 Florida,
 he
 has


been
 doing
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 research
 on


collagen
 and
 joint
 pain
 um
 and
 found


that
 there
 is
 some
 efficacy
 in
 taking


the
 type
 2
 collagen
 to
 reduce
 joint


pain.
 It
 doesn't
 help
 with
 cartilage


regeneration.
 It
 doesn't
 help
 with


osteoarthritis,
 but
 it
 does
 dampen


inflammation
 and
 joint
 pain.
 So
 again,


it
 depends
 on
 what
 you
 want
 to
 use
 it


for.
 In
 the
 first
 episode,
 we
 talked
 a


little
 bit
 about
 environmental
 toxins


and
 I
 wanted
 to
 before
 we
 talk
 about


sleep
 and
 close
 off,
 I
 wanted
 to
 just


mention
 environmental
 toxins
 and
 the


role
 they
 play.
 The
 term
 microplastics


has
 been
 very
 very
 popular
 of
 late.
 When


we
 talk
 about
 environmental
 toxins,
 are


we
 talking
 about
 microplastics
 in
 the


air
 and
 maybe
 the
 water?
 What
 do
 we


mean?


>> Essentially,
 it's
 anything
 in
 our
 world


that
 is
 impacting
 your
 body
 and
 how
 it


functions.
 There's
 a
 few
 different


types,
 right?
 So,
 we
 have
 endocrine


disrupting
 chemicals.
 These
 are
 actual


toxins
 in
 the
 environment,
 in
 cosmetics,


>> cosmetics,
 our
 kitchen,
 our
 food
 that


change
 how
 our
 endocrine
 system
 works,


our
 hormones.
 There's
 also
 things
 like


microplastics
 like
 you
 mentioned,
 which


are
 actually
 going
 to
 deposit
 in
 our


body
 and
 can
 cause
 fibrosis
 even
 in
 our


ovaries,
 therefore
 changing
 how
 an


organ's
 able
 to
 respond
 even
 if
 it
 is


given
 normal
 hormone
 signals.
 And
 then
 I


also
 lump
 into
 this
 category
 behavioral


toxins,
 right?
 things
 like
 alcohol,


marijuana,
 cigarettes,
 the
 the
 choices


that
 are
 toxic
 in
 our
 world
 as
 well.
 So


that
 toxins
 is
 kind
 of
 a
 large
 category.


There
 are
 some
 toxins
 you
 can
 control.


You
 can
 try
 to
 filter
 your
 water.
 You


can
 learn
 what
 is
 in
 your
 water
 so
 that


you
 can
 say
 at
 the,
 you
 know,
 EWG,
 this


is
 my
 zip
 code.
 This
 is
 what's
 in
 my
 tap


water.
 What
 type
 of
 filter
 might
 I
 need


to
 try
 to
 have
 healthier
 drinking
 water


in
 my
 home?
 You
 can
 change
 what
 you're


cooking
 with,
 not
 using
 non-stick


cookware
 or
 teflon.
 you
 can
 get
 rid
 of


plastics
 and
 especially
 what
 you're


putting
 hot
 foods
 and
 beverages
 in


because
 the
 heat
 is
 allowing
 those


toxins
 to
 leak
 into
 those
 things.
 And


then
 as
 Dr.
 Haber
 said,
 our
 cosmetics,


things
 that
 you
 use
 every
 single
 day


that
 you
 put
 in
 and
 on
 your
 body
 are


things
 that
 you're
 having
 a
 higher


exposure
 to.
 And
 it's
 really
 important


to
 decrease
 those
 because
 things
 like


air
 quality,
 you
 might
 not
 have
 as
 much


control
 over
 based
 on
 where
 you
 live.


And
 there's
 so
 many
 toxins
 in
 our
 world


in
 general
 that
 it's
 unrealistic
 to
 say,


"Let's
 avoid
 all
 of
 them."
 And
 because


of
 this,
 we
 have
 that
 same
 mentality


that
 we
 see
 with
 exercise
 sometimes.


Well,
 it's
 just
 there's
 too
 many.
 I


can't
 avoid
 them
 all.
 So,
 I
 will
 ignore


this
 category
 because
 it's
 easier
 to


just
 do
 nothing
 instead
 of
 making
 active


decisions
 to
 start
 to
 live
 a
 less
 toxic


life.


>> What
 changes
 have
 you
 made
 to
 remove


pollutants
 and
 environmental
 toxins
 from


your
 lives?
 Because
 we're
 in
 that


fertility
 journey.
 I
 remember
 I
 came


home
 in
 one
 day
 and
 like
 all
 my
 shampoo


and
 stuff
 had
 gone.


>> Yeah.
 So
 my
 nice
 stuff
 is


>> starting
 to
 look
 through
 your
 products


and
 get
 getting
 rid
 of
 things
 that
 have


endocrine
 disruptors
 in
 them.
 You
 want


to
 look
 the
 kitchen
 is
 probably
 the


greatest
 source
 of
 exposure
 for
 most


people.
 So
 there's
 really
 no
 need
 to


have
 any
 plastics
 in
 your
 kitchen.
 So


getting
 rid
 of
 them.
 But
 many
 people


don't
 think
 about
 when
 you
 do
 have


processed
 foods.
 The
 wrapping,
 the


container,
 anything
 that's
 coming


packaged
 likely
 has
 toxins
 in
 it.
 When


you
 order
 Door
 Dash
 and
 it
 comes
 and
 you


have
 it
 in
 a
 container,
 that's
 often
 hot


food
 in
 a
 container
 that
 is
 leeching


chemicals
 into
 it.
 So,
 a
 simple
 thing
 is


take
 it
 out
 of
 that
 right
 away,
 even
 if


you're
 not
 eating
 it.
 Put
 it
 into


something
 glass
 or
 a
 different
 type
 of


container.
 So,
 you
 can
 try
 to
 minimize


that
 exposure.
 Thinking
 about
 hot


beverages,
 things
 that
 go
 in
 the


microwave
 or
 the
 dishwasher,
 especially,


but
 then
 other
 things
 like
 thermal


receipts.
 So,
 getting
 receipts,
 uh,


thermal
 receipts
 have
 BPA
 in
 them.
 So,


getting
 receipts
 or


>> receipts.
 Yeah.
 So
 the
 airline
 tickets


or
 that
 thermal
 paper.
 So
 just
 the


receipt
 from
 the
 grocery
 store
 when
 they


say,
 "Stephen,
 do
 you
 want
 your


receipt?"
 You
 can
 just
 say,
 "No."
 And


then
 if
 you
 work
 with
 thermal
 paper,


maybe
 you're
 a
 cashier
 and
 you
 touch
 it


over
 and
 over.
 I
 highly
 recommend
 you


wear
 gloves
 because
 your
 exposure
 to


that
 thermal
 paper
 is
 so
 much
 higher


that
 it
 can
 become
 problematic
 for
 you.


>> Does
 it
 really
 make
 a
 difference
 if
 I


take
 the
 receipt
 or
 not?
 You
 know,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 where
 you
 can
 do


that
 say
 that
 person
 touched
 receipts


all
 day
 and
 they
 still
 got
 pregnant
 or


their
 sperm
 was
 great
 or
 they
 lived
 a


long
 time.
 We
 can
 list
 a
 whole
 lot
 of


negative
 behaviors
 or
 habits
 or


exposures
 that
 one
 person
 might
 tolerate


just
 fine.
 And
 for
 somebody
 else,
 the


sum
 of
 all
 of
 these
 behaviors
 add
 up
 to


be
 something
 that
 puts
 them
 in
 a
 place


that
 is
 very
 pro-inflammatory,


not
 healthy
 for
 the
 now
 or
 for
 the


future.
 That
 to
 me
 is
 an
 easy
 dec
 on
 the


scale
 of
 decisions
 that
 are
 hard
 or
 that


are
 easy.
 Trying
 to
 change
 the
 things


that
 you're
 exposed
 to
 in
 your
 world.


You
 have
 to
 spend
 some
 time
 to
 learn


about
 it.
 You
 might
 have
 to
 buy
 some
 new


things.
 But
 over
 time,
 those
 decisions


are
 ultimately
 easier
 than
 how
 you
 eat,


your
 exercise.
 Those
 those
 take
 longer


commitment.
 And
 especially
 if
 you're


partnered,
 if
 you
 live
 with
 somebody,


then
 the
 foods
 that
 you
 eat,
 your


sleeping
 habits
 depend
 on
 them.
 You
 both


have
 to
 be
 together
 on
 this.
 So


sometimes
 I
 always
 say
 toxins
 are
 to
 one


place
 a
 thing
 you
 can
 do.
 You
 can
 look


at
 your
 products.
 You
 can
 start
 to
 when


they
 run
 out
 say
 is
 this
 one
 healthy
 for


me?
 Should
 I
 get
 something
 that's
 going


to
 have
 less
 of
 an
 impact?
 That
 one
 time


of
 using
 very
 scented
 hand
 wash
 is
 no


big
 deal.
 But
 when
 you
 wash
 your
 hands


with
 that
 highly
 scented
 hand
 wash
 five


times
 a
 day
 over
 and
 over,
 it
 is
 just
 an


avenue
 of
 endocrine
 disruption
 that
 can


add
 up
 to
 the
 litany
 of
 the
 other
 ones


that
 you're
 experiencing.
 So
 we're
 all


saying
 these
 little
 changes
 on
 one
 hand


singularly
 probably
 do
 not
 matter
 much,


but
 together
 they
 do.


>> And
 there's
 a
 link
 between
 environmental


toxins
 and
 menopause
 or
 early
 menopause.


>> Early
 menopause,
 we
 think
 so.
 So,
 you


know,
 you
 were
 born
 with
 a
 shelf
 life,
 a


genetically
 predisposition
 shelf
 life
 on


the
 ovary.
 Okay?
 And
 we
 don't
 know
 a
 lot


of
 things
 to
 extend
 that
 shelf
 life
 cuz


we
 have a
 certain
 number
 of
 eggs.
 But


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 we
 can
 do
 to


speed
 that
 process
 up.
 So,
 that's
 going


to
 be
 smoking.
 Women
 who
 smoke


cigarettes
 or,
 you
 know,
 um
 even
 we're


looking
 at
 vaping
 now
 because
 it's
 a


newer
 thing,
 but
 definitely
 tobacco


consumption,
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 form
 of


smoking.
 We
 see
 earlier
 menopause.
 um


the
 so
 there
 was
 this
 incredible
 study


where
 they
 looked
 at
 women
 who
 were


sexually
 abused
 who
 then
 had
 children


who
 were
 sexually
 abused
 went
 through


menopause
 I
 think
 nine
 years
 sooner
 so


and
 it's
 the
 only
 study
 that
 looked
 at


this
 and
 it
 happened
 to
 be
 the
 stress


they
 looked
 at
 was
 sexual
 abuse
 in
 the


mother
 and
 the
 child
 and
 so
 they
 went


through
 menopause
 nine
 years
 sooner
 so


there
 is
 a
 component
 of
 emotional
 stress


and
 long-term
 chronic
 emotional
 stress


>> it
 does
 cause
 chronic
 inflam-


And
 the
 ovaries
 are
 highly
 sensitive
 to


chronic
 inflammation.
 We
 know
 that
 BPA


exposure
 has
 shown
 that
 if
 you
 have
 a


higher
 level
 of
 BPA
 exposure,
 you
 have


lower
 ovarian
 reserve,
 meaning
 less
 eggs


in
 your
 ovary
 will
 go
 into
 menopause


earlier.
 And


>> what
 is
 BPA?


>> BPA
 is
 one
 of
 those
 environmental


chemicals
 that
 we're
 exposed
 to
 largely


through
 plastics,
 but
 it's
 also
 one


that's
 in
 the
 thermal
 receipt
 paper
 that


we're
 trying
 to
 avoid
 our
 exposure
 to.


And
 that's
 where
 some
 of
 the
 data
 even


when
 it
 comes
 back
 to
 food
 where
 soy


intaking
 soy
 products
 can
 actually
 be


very
 protective
 because
 it
 combats
 BPA.


So
 how
 it
 works.
 So
 when
 people
 say,


"Oh,
 you
 shouldn't
 have
 tofu.
 You're
 a


man.
 Soy
 is
 so
 bad
 for
 you."
 That's


actually
 false.
 And
 we
 found
 that
 people


who
 had
 greater
 exposure
 to
 soy
 products


actually
 had
 the
 lowest
 level
 of
 BPA
 and


improved
 reproductive
 performance


because
 of
 that.
 So
 there's
 definitely


correlation
 with
 these
 toxins
 in
 our


world
 and
 we
 might
 say,
 "Oh,
 is
 it


linked
 to
 menopause?
 Maybe
 nobody's
 done


that
 exact
 study,
 but
 it
 absolutely
 is.


If
 you
 have
 lower
 eggs
 at
 an
 earlier


time
 period,


>> that's
 going
 to
 give
 you
 an
 earlier


menopause
 going."
 You
 know,
 the
 flip


side
 of
 fertility
 is
 menopause.
 So,


>> and
 lastly,
 I
 wanted
 to
 talk
 about


sleep.


>> Well,
 it's
 all
 of
 our
 favorites
 and


we're
 doing
 it
 last.


>> So,
 yeah,
 Vonda,
 I've
 heard
 you
 refer
 to


sleep
 as
 the
 pillar
 of
 everything.
 Mhm.


>> And
 I
 say
 that
 because
 we
 think
 sleep
 is


just
 passing
 out
 like
 we're
 not


conscious.
 Well,
 that
 may
 be
 true
 from
 a


from
 a
 uh
 our
 viewpoint,
 but
 it
 is
 the


most
 regenerative
 period
 in
 our
 day.


Actually,
 the
 brain
 is
 processing


information,
 getting
 rid
 of
 toxins.
 The


body
 is
 able
 to
 uh
 settle
 and
 again
 get


rid
 of
 toxins.
 But
 many
 women
 in
 midlife


have
 completely
 disrupted
 sleep
 because


estrogen
 is
 critical.


Yes,
 80%
 very
 high.
 Um,
 estrogen
 is


critical
 for
 uh
 sleep
 patterns.
 Um,


many
 women
 wake
 up
 at
 3:37


or
 thereabouts
 either
 with
 a
 plummeting


blood
 sugar
 or
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 around


the
 time
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 night
 that


the
 sleep
 disruption
 has.
 So
 this
 broken


up
 sleep,
 if
 you
 don't
 do
 it,
 then
 all


the
 lifestyle
 things
 Stacy
 and
 the
 rest


of
 us
 have
 been
 talking
 about
 are
 nearly


impossible
 to
 do
 if
 you're


underreovered.
 And
 so
 I
 have
 made
 after


nearly
 11
 years
 of
 not
 sleeping
 because


of
 training
 and
 child
 a
 religion
 almost


like
 I
 am
 dedicated
 to
 this
 function.
 I


do
 not
 eat
 3
 hours
 before
 I
 go
 to
 sleep.


Uh,
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 primary
 reasons
 that


I
 made
 the
 decision
 to
 stop
 drinking


alcohol
 because
 that
 completely


disrupted
 my
 sleep.
 And
 I
 am
 more


conscious
 of
 circadian
 rhythm
 than
 I've


ever
 been
 in
 my
 life.
 Meaning
 I
 go
 to


bed
 when
 I'm
 except
 except
 probably
 when


I'm
 traveling,
 but
 at
 the
 exact
 same


time
 every
 night,
 but
 more
 importantly


get
 up
 at
 the
 exact
 same
 time
 every
 day


to
 start
 my
 circadian
 uh
 day.
 um
 and
 to


start
 my
 adenazine
 usage
 so
 that
 by
 9:30


at
 night
 I'm
 ready
 to
 rest.
 It's
 that


important.


>> A
 woman's
 guide
 to
 a
 aging
 with
 power.


Unbreakable.


>> Yes.
 Unbreakable.


>> And
 central
 to
 that
 is
 circadian
 rhythms


and
 sleep,


>> right?


>> Yeah.
 It
 is
 because
 the
 premise
 of
 this


book
 is
 that
 uh
 women
 are
 already


winning
 the
 longevity
 race
 but
 we
 suffer


longer
 and
 we
 have
 this
 vision
 of
 women


aging
 which
 is
 usually
 a
 vision
 of


frailty.
 But
 through
 the
 mindset
 changes


through
 the
 behavior
 such
 as
 sleep
 and


lifting
 and
 considering
 hormones


we
 can
 age
 in
 a
 different
 way.
 So
 I'm


trying
 to
 re-educate
 the
 world
 that
 a


woman's
 destiny
 is
 not
 frailty.
 A
 woman


can
 age
 powerfully
 but
 not
 if
 we
 sit


around
 and
 wait
 for
 time
 to
 make
 us
 its


victim.
 We
 must
 be
 proactive.
 And
 sleep


is
 one
 component
 of
 that.
 This
 should
 be


the
 very
 first
 thing
 you
 do.
 Sleep
 sets


the
 stage
 for
 your
 entire
 day.
 It's


really
 that
 foundation
 of
 your
 health.


If
 you
 are
 going
 to
 start
 the
 day
 in
 a


sleep
 deficit,
 you're
 starting
 out


stressed,
 inflamed,
 insulin
 resistant.


There's
 going
 to
 be
 no
 behaviors
 you
 can


do
 during
 the
 day
 that
 are
 going
 to


overcome
 the
 deficit.
 And
 we
 know
 that


women
 who
 get
 less
 sleep,
 they
 take


longer
 to
 get
 pregnant.
 They
 have
 higher


rates
 of
 infertility.
 We
 know
 that
 men


who
 get
 less
 sleep
 have
 lower
 sperm


parameters
 and
 lower
 testosterone


levels.
 So
 if
 we
 are
 saying
 you
 Stephen,


you
 know,
 what's
 one
 thing
 you
 might
 be


able
 to
 do?
 Well,
 are
 you
 sleeping
 well?


That's
 one
 of
 the
 first
 things
 you
 can


start
 to
 do
 to
 say,
 am
 I
 getting
 7
 to
 N


hours
 of
 good
 quality
 sleep?
 That's
 not


just
 time
 in
 bed
 because
 Mary
 Cla
 has


her
 phone
 on
 her.
 That
 is
 actual


sleeping
 time.
 And
 that
 makes
 a
 huge


difference
 in
 trying
 to
 achieve,
 you


know,
 a
 hormonal
 health,
 which
 is
 really


what
 we're
 all
 saying
 here
 is
 how
 do
 we


get
 our
 body
 in
 the
 best
 quote
 unquote


balance
 that
 we
 can,
 which
 means
 working


with
 the
 different
 building
 blocks
 of


our
 body
 in
 the
 most
 optimal
 way
 for
 as


long
 as
 possible
 to
 be
 healthy.
 And
 even


if
 we're
 not
 looking
 from
 a
 fertility


standpoint,
 you
 can't
 invoke
 any
 kind
 of


metabolic
 or
 body
 composition
 change


without
 adequate
 sleep.
 So
 that's
 what
 I


mean.
 It's
 like
 when
 we're
 talking
 about


the
 pillars
 and
 sleep
 being
 one
 of
 the


first
 things
 we
 have
 to
 work
 on,
 you


can't
 invoke
 any
 kind
 of
 change
 with


>> we're
 not
 talking
 about
 ambient
 induced


sleep.
 No,
 medication
 induced
 sleep


doesn't
 count.


>> This
 is
 not
 medication
 induced
 sleep.


There's
 a
 huge
 percentage
 of
 patients


out
 there
 who
 are
 addicted
 to
 these


medications
 and
 it
 has
 become
 the
 only


way
 that
 they
 can
 sleep.


>> I've
 been
 really
 shocked
 at
 several
 of


the
 women
 in
 my
 life
 that
 are
 between


the
 ages
 of
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 35.
 Yeah.


35
 and
 45
 who
 have
 like
 three
 to
 four


hours
 sleep
 and
 they
 appear
 to
 be


perfectly
 fine.


>> They
 are
 not.
 They
 are
 not.
 Their
 cells


are
 not
 fine,
 Stephen.


>> No.


>> Cuz
 obviously
 cuz
 I
 do
 this
 a
 lot.
 I
 I


learned
 from
 all
 these
 scientists.
 But


there's
 one
 partic
 there
 mean
 there's


two
 particular
 women
 that
 I'm
 very
 close


to
 that
 I
 actually
 work
 with
 in


different
 capacities
 who
 showed
 me
 their


Whoop
 data
 and
 would
 often
 tell
 me
 they


would
 say
 I
 get
 three
 hours
 four
 hours


sleep.
 And
 I
 thought
 there's
 no
 way


because
 she
 did
 a
 5K
 this
 morning
 at


6:00
 a.m.
 So
 there's
 no
 way
 she's


getting
 three
 to
 four
 hours
 sleep.
 to


put
 a
 sleep
 tracker
 on
 her
 and
 she
 was


getting
 3
 to
 4
 hours
 sleep
 and
 her


restorative
 sleep
 is
 like
 45
 minutes


>> but
 she's
 springing
 into
 the
 makeup


chair
 next
 to
 me


>> and
 she's
 all
 she's
 got
 all
 the
 energy


I'm
 thinking
 what
 the
 hell
 is
 going
 on


>> youth


>> but
 I'm
 younger
 than
 her


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 when
 I
 was
 in
 training
 I
 was


getting
 3
 to
 5
 hours
 and
 getting
 up
 and


operating
 but
 I
 cannot
 do
 that
 now


>> if
 I
 got
 3
 to
 four
 hours
 I
 was
 good
 for


the
 day


>> how


>> because
 I
 was
 20
 years
 25
 years
 younger


>> Mhm.
 M


>> I
 think
 we
 all
 got
 through
 like
 I
 was


telling
 some
 of
 my
 earlier
 years


>> breastfeeding
 mother
 is
 getting
 3
 to


four
 hours
 you
 know
 that
 is
 part
 of
 the


wow
 we're
 built
 we
 can
 function
 but
 age


will
 take
 that
 resilience
 away
 from
 us


>> because
 permenopause
 causes
 sleep


fluctuations
 as
 well
 that
 because
 of
 the


change
 in
 hormones
 right


>> exactly


>> and
 are
 women
 just
 assuming
 that's


normal
 and
 rolling
 with
 it
 or
 is
 it
 okay


>> I
 think
 we
 have
 more
 at
 public
 education


about
 how
 important
 sleep
 is
 and
 and
 the


number
 of
 hours
 you
 need
 and
 the
 quality


of
 the
 sleep.
 So,
 I
 think
 years
 ago
 it


was
 their
 normal
 and
 I'm
 just
 going
 to


keep
 going,
 but
 now
 they're
 coming
 in


saying,
 "This
 is
 a
 problem."


>> Yep.


>> I
 need
 help.


>> And
 I
 would
 be
 interested
 to
 see
 your


glucose
 monitor.


>> When
 you
 first
 used
 it,
 because
 that's


how
 we
 can
 kind
 of
 navigate
 sleep,
 too,


is
 showing
 hypoglycemic
 effects
 for


women
 who
 are
 exercising
 in
 pmenopause


and
 not
 eating
 enough.
 Melatonin
 is
 that


a
 solution?


>> No,


>> it
 can
 be
 a
 tool
 in
 the
 toolkit.
 Most
 of


the
 time,
 you
 know,
 most
 people
 are


taking
 too
 high
 a
 dose
 of
 melatonin,


which
 is
 actually
 doing
 more
 harm
 than


good.


>> What
 harm
 is
 it
 doing?


>> Well,
 it's
 actually
 shutting
 off
 part
 of


the
 brain
 to
 be
 able
 to
 help
 control


their
 circadian
 rhythm
 and
 then
 they're


completely
 dependent
 upon
 it.
 And
 it's


such
 an
 artificial
 induction,
 it's
 going


to
 w
 wear
 out
 of
 their
 system.
 So
 your


melatonin
 is
 supposed
 to
 rise,
 help
 you


go
 to
 sleep,
 and
 then
 it
 falls
 at
 a
 rate


for
 when
 you're
 going
 to
 wake
 up
 so
 that


when
 it's
 lower,
 you're
 going
 to
 wake
 up


and
 your
 cortisol
 will
 naturally
 rise.


Melatonin
 can
 be
 helpful
 in
 very
 low


doses,


>> like
 three.
 Most
 people
 are
 taking
 5
 to


10.


>> 10.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 often
 recommend,
 you
 know,


the
 patients
 take
 maybe
 like
 a


milligram,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 buy
 a


children's
 melatonin
 very
 often
 for
 that


dose
 of
 it
 because
 people
 are
 taking


these
 huge
 huge
 amounts
 over
 the


counter.
 You
 can
 just
 get
 so
 much.
 And


so
 what
 you
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 is
 that
 if


you're
 using
 it,
 you're
 going
 to
 take


melatonin
 at
 a
 time
 where
 you're
 going


to
 be
 able
 to
 go
 to
 sleep
 about
 30


minutes
 afterward,
 too.
 Because
 people


are
 also
 using
 melatonin
 and
 then
 not


allowing
 themselves
 the
 restful
 moment


when
 it's
 trying
 to
 kick
 in
 and
 then


they're
 taking
 more
 or
 they're
 staying


up
 later
 and
 they're
 suppressing
 their


brain's
 ability
 to
 make
 their
 own


melatonin.


>> One
 of
 the
 questions
 we
 had
 from
 the


audience
 was
 from
 a
 young
 girl
 that


said,
 a
 young
 woman
 that
 said,
 "I'm
 24


years
 old
 and
 I
 struggle
 so
 much
 to
 fall


asleep.
 How
 can
 I
 fix
 my
 sleeping


naturally
 if
 I
 have
 disturbed
 set


circadian
 rhythm
 and
 especially
 during


my
 menration
 my
 sleeping
 pattern
 seems


to
 get
 worse.


This
 one
 would
 be
 interesting
 to
 see


like
 what
 is
 her
 daily
 like
 what
 are
 her


daily
 habits
 if
 we
 can
 kind
 of
 bring


calorie
 intake
 and
 all
 those
 things
 back


into
 the
 day
 so
 she's
 not
 phase
 shifting


and
 then
 use
 things
 like
 eltheanine


which
 is
 a
 a
 nonproin
 amino
 acid
 that


works
 the
 GABA
 right
 trying
 to
 bring


parasympathetic
 activation
 back
 and


making
 calm
 down


>> yeah
 and
 seeing
 what
 is
 what
 are
 your


sleep
 hygiene
 habits
 is
 your
 phone
 out


of
 your
 room
 do
 you
 have
 um
 like
 a
 cool


bedroom.
 Do
 you
 have
 earplugs
 to
 block


out
 some
 of
 the
 extraneous
 noises
 that


might
 partner
 doing?


>> Yeah,
 sleep
 sleep
 is
 really
 a
 lifestyle


problem
 for
 most
 people,
 isn't
 it?


>> But
 magnesium
 can
 be
 advantageous
 as


well,
 especially
 if
 you're
 on
 your


menstrual
 cycle
 and
 you're
 having


menstrual
 related
 sleep.
 So,
 I
 think


that's
 an
 important
 thing.


Well,
 it's
 just
 many
 women
 run
 low
 in


magnesium,
 especially
 when
 your
 hormones


are
 very
 low,
 especially
 when
 your


estrogen
 and
 progesterone
 low,
 you're


having,
 you
 know,
 contractility
 of
 your


uterus,
 when
 you're
 having
 menstrual


cramps.
 Magnesium
 can
 help
 counter
 some


of
 that
 and
 can
 also
 help
 you,
 if
 you're


taking
 it
 at
 night,
 get
 into
 a
 more


restful
 pattern.
 So,
 um
 I've
 been


working
 with
 a
 sleep
 medicine
 specialist


um
 and
 one
 of
 the
 things
 she
 points
 out


which
 I
 now
 discuss
 with
 my
 patients
 is


listen
 if
 we're
 women
 wake
 up
 in


menopause
 from
 hot
 flashes
 from
 night


sweats
 and
 then
 the
 the
 relaxation
 we


get
 from
 progesterone
 is
 gone
 so
 we
 can


add
 that
 back
 in.
 So
 say
 we
 we've
 done


all
 the
 things
 we've
 given
 her
 a
 touch


of
 melatonin
 we've
 put
 her
 on
 hormones


she
 is
 still
 waking
 up
 at
 3
 in
 the


morning
 consistently.
 Mhm.


>> She
 deserves
 a
 workup
 for
 sleep
 apnea


because
 women
 disease
 differently
 than


men.
 And
 men
 with
 sleep
 apnnea,
 it's
 a


very
 common
 presentation
 of
 snoring.


They're
 waking
 up
 the
 partner,
 you
 know,


all
 these
 things.
 Women
 are
 much
 quieter


about
 it.
 They
 still
 have
 the
 pallet


that
 falls
 back
 and
 the
 relaxation.
 And


that's
 hormonally
 driven
 for
 a
 lot
 of


women.
 And
 so
 they're
 becoming
 hypoxic


in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 night
 from
 you
 know


that's
 one
 of
 those
 side
 effects
 of
 of


having
 sleep
 apnea
 is
 you
 stop
 breathing


and
 you
 lo
 your
 oxygen
 levels
 decline


you
 become
 hypoxic
 but
 we
 are
 not


recognizing
 it
 in
 women
 more
 than
 50%
 of


women
 are
 going
 undiagnosed
 and
 are


living
 shorter
 lives
 having
 more


Alzheimer's
 because
 of
 this.
 So
 if
 I


have
 a
 patient
 coming
 in
 and
 we've
 done


everything
 and
 she
 is
 still
 consistently


getting
 up
 I'm
 sending
 her
 for
 a
 sleep


apnea
 evaluation.
 M
 I've
 also
 been


reading
 literature
 on
 um
 CBT,
 so


insomnia
 CBT
 that
 they've
 done
 with
 a


lot
 of
 veterans
 and
 shift
 workers
 and


that
 seems
 really
 interesting


>> to
 help
 them
 fall
 back.


>> Yes.
 To
 break
 the
 pattern
 because
 your


body
 and
 your
 brain
 learn
 that
 wake
 up


pattern.
 So
 if
 you
 can
 reset
 it,


>> then
 that's
 very
 helpful
 as
 well.


>> Yeah.


>> What
 is
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 we


should
 have
 talked
 about
 that
 we
 didn't


talk
 about?
 Dr.
 All
 right.


>> I
 think
 we
 covered
 an
 amazing
 array
 of


information,
 but
 what
 I
 want
 women
 to


walk
 away
 from
 this
 is
 with
 there's
 that


there's
 a
 hope


>> for
 feeling
 like
 themselves
 again.


>> Yeah.
 and
 that
 they
 are
 worth


investigating
 to
 the
 ends
 of
 the
 earth


to
 find
 the
 answers
 they
 need
 and
 not


simply
 giving
 up
 the
 first
 time
 somebody


says
 no
 to
 them
 or
 doesn't
 hear
 them


when
 they
 say
 that
 they
 don't
 feel
 like


themselves.
 They
 must
 continue
 to
 pursue


it.
 And
 number
 three,
 that
 they
 are


worth
 the
 work
 that
 it
 takes
 to
 age
 with


power.


Beautifully
 said,


Octavia,


>> you
 really
 kn
 do
 need
 to
 be
 the
 CEO
 of


your
 own
 healthcare.
 Um,
 we
 have
 a


medical
 system
 that
 was
 not
 built
 to


serve
 the
 aging
 woman.
 Um,
 after


reproduction
 ends,
 it's
 just
 we
 become


small
 men
 with
 rust
 and
 uteruses
 to


quote
 Dr.
 Sims.


>> And


you,
 it's
 okay
 to
 educate
 yourself.
 It's


okay
 to
 read
 the
 books.
 It's
 okay
 to
 go


in
 educated
 with
 checklists
 and
 you're


going
 to
 probably
 have
 to
 do
 that
 and
 to


go
 find
 someone
 who's
 educated
 in
 the


health
 of
 women
 after
 reproduction
 ends.


And
 that
 could
 be
 your
 internist.
 It


could
 be
 family
 medicine.
 But
 like


there's
 no
 no
 one
 owns


menopause
 life
 after
 reproduction
 ends.


You
 know,
 no
 specialty
 really
 owns
 it.


And
 so
 you
 are
 going
 to
 have
 to


quarterback
 this
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 yourself


until
 you
 find
 the
 right
 partner
 in
 this


care.
 But
 it
 is
 worth
 it.


>> Beautifully
 said
 as
 well.
 Yeah,
 I
 think


when
 it
 comes
 to
 your
 health
 journey,


nobody
 is
 really
 responsible
 for
 it


except
 you.
 But
 there's
 this
 idea
 that


we
 should
 wait
 until
 things
 are
 wrong
 to


then
 go
 get
 them
 fixed.
 And
 what
 we
 are


all
 trying
 to
 do
 across
 the
 spectrum
 of


you
 know
 women's
 health
 and
 their


lifespan
 is
 to
 say
 many
 of
 these
 things


if
 we
 start
 focusing
 on
 them
 much


earlier
 and
 take
 a
 preventive
 approach


which
 is
 often
 against
 some
 of
 these


recommendations
 about
 when
 you
 should


screen
 or
 when
 you
 should
 do
 testing.


But
 if
 we
 say,
 well,
 what
 is
 best
 for


you
 as
 an
 individual?
 Focus
 on
 setting


up
 a
 life
 that
 is
 going
 to
 help
 prevent


some
 of
 these
 diseased
 outcomes.
 Start


testing
 things
 earlier.
 You're
 going
 to


be
 in
 a
 position
 of
 power
 to
 make
 the


decisions
 that
 are
 right
 for
 you
 from
 a


place
 of
 education
 and
 not
 be
 left


making
 them
 out
 of
 fear
 or


misinformation
 or
 not
 knowing
 because


when
 it
 women
 will
 go
 through
 these


stages.
 Time
 will
 make
 your
 fertility


decisions
 for
 you
 if
 you
 do
 not.
 that


that's
 a
 fact
 that
 your
 ovaries
 will


stop
 functioning.
 You
 will
 go
 into


menopause.
 So,
 we
 need
 to
 both
 prepare


for
 our
 reproductive
 years,
 optimize
 our


fertility
 the
 best
 we
 can
 if
 that's
 a


life
 goal
 for
 us,
 but
 to
 realize
 that
 it


doesn't
 stop
 there.
 That
 you're
 have
 to


prepare
 for
 the
 next
 stage
 of
 the


journey
 and
 what
 that's
 going
 to
 look


like
 for
 you.
 But
 the
 steps
 to
 take
 care


of
 yourself
 start
 well
 before
 if
 you're


able
 to.
 I
 look
 at
 the
 the
 research
 and


the
 health
 outcomes
 right
 now
 for
 women


and
 it
 is
 a
 very
 confusing
 space.
 So
 I


always
 preface
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 I
 want


women
 to
 be
 empowered
 and
 how
 do
 you
 do


that?
 You
 can't
 Google
 things
 and
 find


out.
 So
 it's
 asking
 questions.
 It's


sharing
 information.
 Most
 of
 all
 taking


up
 the
 space
 because
 you've
 earned
 it.
 I


get
 so
 tired
 of
 the
 rhetoric
 that
 women


should
 be
 small
 and
 demure
 and
 be
 like
 a


delicate
 flower
 and
 things
 are
 happening


to
 them
 that
 they
 can't
 control.
 I
 want


the
 narrative
 to
 shift.
 I
 want
 people
 to


say
 I
 own
 the
 space.
 I'm
 taking
 up
 the


space
 and
 it's
 my
 I
 don't
 like
 to
 use


the
 word
 right
 because
 it
 invokes
 a
 lot


of
 angst.
 But
 it
 is
 your
 ability
 to


understand
 your
 own
 body
 and
 advocate


for
 yourself
 that's
 going
 to
 allow
 you


to
 take
 up
 that
 space
 and
 get
 the


answers
 that
 you
 want.
 I've
 been


advocating
 for
 so
 many
 women,
 myself


included,
 and
 the
 push
 back
 that
 you
 get


from
 the
 medical
 society
 is
 real.
 It's


not
 that
 they
 necessarily
 are
 trying
 to


gaslight
 you,
 but
 it's
 just
 a
 product
 of


the
 system.
 So,
 you
 do
 have
 to
 push


those
 boundaries.
 You
 do
 have
 to
 ask


those
 hard
 questions.
 You
 do
 have
 to
 go


in
 prepared
 to
 have
 that
 push
 back,
 but


take
 that
 space
 because
 everybody


deserves
 a
 place
 at
 the
 table
 and


women's
 healthcare
 is
 being
 shunted
 in
 a


way
 right
 now
 that
 is
 really


unacceptable
 and
 we
 need
 to
 have
 ground


swell
 movement
 to
 push
 back.


>> Thank
 you
 all
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you.


>> I
 really
 mean
 that.
 I
 I'm
 thanking
 you


on
 behalf
 of
 the
 many
 millions
 of
 people


that
 are
 probably
 listening
 to
 to
 this


conversation
 um
 because
 you
 know
 your


conversations
 on
 this
 show
 have


delivered
 more
 than
 30
 million
 downloads


between
 you
 so
 across
 YouTube
 and
 across


audio.
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 the
 numbers
 and


it's
 staggering
 and
 you
 think
 about
 the


impact
 of
 reaching
 potentially
 30


million
 people
 just
 on
 this
 show
 in
 long


form
 and
 then
 their
 friends
 and
 then


their
 family
 and
 then
 the
 advice
 that


they
 give
 to
 everybody
 they
 know
 and


that
 domino
 effect
 is
 causing
 this


wonderful
 ripple
 across
 the
 planet
 and


it's
 turning
 the
 lights
 on
 in
 different


households
 and
 within
 families
 and


amongst
 business
 owners
 like
 myself
 so


that
 we
 can
 all
 cater
 to
 the
 the
 plight


I
 guess
 of
 women's
 health
 in
 a
 more


effective
 way
 cuz
 you
 know
 even
 as
 a
 man


I've
 learned
 oh
 god
 so
 much
 from
 you
 for


>> great


>> and
 the
 impact
 it's
 had
 on
 my
 life


through
 improving
 how
 I
 show
 up
 for
 the


women
 in
 my
 life
 but
 also
 the
 the
 way


that
 I'm
 able
 to


respond
 and
 support
 my
 partner,
 my


sister,
 my
 mother
 in
 difficult
 times
 has


been
 profound
 and
 I
 think
 some
 you
 know


and
 well
 done
 to
 all
 the
 men
 that
 have


listened
 to
 this
 conversation
 and
 have


gotten
 to
 this
 stage
 because
 I
 know
 you


don't
 kind
 of
 you
 often
 don't
 think
 it's


a
 problem
 that
 you're
 going to
 deal
 with


but
 when
 51%
 or
 52%
 of
 the
 planet
 are


women
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 huge
 part
 of
 your


life
 whether
 as
 a
 as
 you
 having


daughters
 or
 sisters
 or
 or
 mothers
 and


through
 all
 of
 the
 work
 that
 you've
 done


I've
 been
 able
 to
 understand
 the
 women


in
 my
 life
 better
 and
 actually
 that's


protected
 my
 relationships
 and
 if
 it's


protected
 my
 relationships
 it's


protecting
 me
 and
 um
 I've
 really
 noticed


that
 I've
 noticed
 how
 I've
 changed


especially
 through
 understanding
 the


menstrual
 cycle
 um
 how
 I
 treat
 treat
 my


partner
 but
 but
 it's
 you
 four
 you
 are


like
 the
 avengers
 of
 what
 you
 do.
 You're


the
 you're
 the
 very
 best
 in
 your


industries
 and
 um


>> drink
 it.


>> I
 highly
 recommend
 everybody
 goes
 and


checks
 out.
 I'm
 going to
 link
 all
 of


your
 books
 below.
 Uh
 Unbreakable,
 the


fertility
 formula,
 the
 new
 menopause.
 I


believe
 you've
 got
 a
 new
 book
 on
 the
 way


menopause.


>> The
 new
 permenopause.
 I'll
 link
 that
 as


well
 if
 it's
 available
 for
 pre-order
 and


raw,
 but
 also
 just
 your
 you'll
 make


content,
 have
 Instagram
 pages,
 and
 have


websites.
 So,
 all
 of
 that
 will
 be
 linked


in
 the
 description
 below.
 And
 if
 you


want
 to
 go
 deeper
 on
 these
 subjects
 that


we've
 talked
 about
 today,
 then
 those
 are


the
 doorways
 into
 a
 a
 deeper


understanding.
 I
 appreciate
 you
 all
 so


so
 much.


>> We've
 been
 for
 what
 9
 hours
 now
 and
 uh


>> I'm
 sure
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 So


>> thank
 you.
