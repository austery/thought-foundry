What's
 the
 story
 with
 the
 California


wealth
 tax?
 Can
 somebody
 explain
 this
 to


me?
 Okay.
 So,
 the
 SEIU,
 the
 Service


Employees
 Union,
 filed
 a
 ballot


initiative,
 which
 means
 a
 directto
 voter


vote
 to
 amend
 the
 California


Constitution
 to
 introduce
 a
 one-time


billionaire's
 wealth
 tax
 where


billionaires,
 anyone
 who
 has
 assets
 over


a
 billion
 dollars
 net
 of
 their
 debt,
 has


to
 pay
 a
 one-time
 tax
 of
 5%
 of
 their
 net


worth,
 including
 their
 private
 stock,


including
 their
 real
 estate.
 You
 said


5%.
 5%


of
 their
 net
 worth,
 not
 of
 their
 income,


of
 their
 net
 worth,
 the
 entire
 net


worth,
 onetime
 payment
 to
 the
 state
 of


California,
 and
 then
 there's
 an


allocation
 on
 how
 that
 money
 will
 be


spent,
 but
 it's
 a
 onetime
 billionaire


tax.
 Now,
 it
 is
 very
 likely
 that
 this


sort
 of
 an
 amendment
 to
 the
 California


Constitution
 is
 not
 constitutional
 and


actually
 cannot
 be
 made
 and
 will
 not


actually
 go
 into
 enforcement
 even
 if
 the


voters
 do
 vote
 to
 approve
 it
 in
 both
 a


federal
 and
 a
 state
 level
 based
 on
 this


concept
 of
 uniformity
 which
 is
 that
 you


have
 to
 tax
 everyone
 equally
 except
 for


the
 case
 of
 an
 excise
 tax
 which
 is
 like


income
 or
 a
 transaction.
 You're
 allowed


to
 tax
 disproportionately
 based
 on
 the


size
 of
 the
 income
 or
 the
 size
 of
 the


transaction.
 But
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 tax


on
 property,
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 tax
 on


an
 asset,
 you
 have
 to
 tax
 everyone


uniformally.
 So
 it
 is
 likely
 not
 going


to
 go
 into
 effect
 if
 it
 does
 pass.


However,
 it
 is
 very
 likely
 the
 case
 that


the
 SEIU
 is
 simply
 using
 this
 as
 a


baiting
 mechanism
 to
 get
 people
 to
 stand


up
 and
 denounce
 it
 and
 then
 they
 will
 be


in
 a
 position
 to
 attack
 those
 people
 and


destroy
 them
 and
 use
 this
 effectively
 as


a
 political
 fodder
 for
 this
 next


election
 cycle.
 That's
 what
 it
 seems


like
 the
 true
 kind
 of
 motivation
 right


now.
 Let
 me
 let
 me
 go
 on
 the
 record.
 I


think
 this
 law
 is
 great.


>> He's
 getting
 the
 virtue
 signaling


points.


>> I
 would
 just
 like
 to
 say,
 may
 I
 be
 the


first
 to
 pay
 5%.
 I'll
 be
 in
 the
 front
 of


the
 line.
 Let
 me
 know
 when
 to
 show
 up.


I'll
 bring
 my
 check.


>> Who
 do
 I
 sign
 the
 check
 towards?


>> Shall
 I
 Should
 I
 bring
 cash,
 Gavin?
 We


just
 bring
 it
 cash
 to
 your
 Which
 one
 of


your
 mansion
 should
 I
 bring
 the
 cash
 to?


This
 is
 strategically
 why
 Chimamoth,
 I'm


glad
 I
 got
 out
 of
 California
 right


before
 I
 was
 about
 to
 billionize.
 That


was
 a
 smart
 move
 on
 my
 part.


>> Free,
 what
 are
 the
 odds
 that
 this
 goes


into
 effect?
 Can
 you
 just
 handicap
 this?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 we
 don't
 know
 who's
 going
 to


come
 out
 against
 it,
 but
 there's
 an


effort
 to
 try
 and
 get
 top
 Democrat


officials
 in
 the
 state
 of
 California
 to


say,
 "This
 is
 silly.
 If
 you
 do
 this,


people
 will
 leave
 the
 state."
 yada
 yada.


So,
 that's
 kind
 of
 a
 quiet
 underway


effort.
 But
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 the


citizens
 of
 California,
 the
 majority
 of


citizens
 of
 California
 would
 not
 vote


for
 this.
 Why?
 Who
 wouldn't
 want
 to
 tax


the
 billionaires
 5%.
 Come
 on.
 Like,


>> well,
 the
 way
 the
 way
 that
 it's
 written,


it
 says,
 "Hey
 guys,
 we're
 30
 billion
 in


the
 hole
 and
 there
 are
 200
 Californians


that
 control
 two
 trillion
 dollars.
 We're


just
 going
 to
 ask
 them
 to
 pay
 a
 onetime


fee
 of
 5%."
 Y


>> and
 I
 don't
 see
 how
 anybody
 would
 say


that
 doesn't
 sound
 unreasonable
 at
 the


ballot
 box,


>> right?


>> And
 then
 the
 people
 the
 people
 that
 step


up
 against
 it
 and
 are
 vocal
 against
 it


and
 point
 out
 like
 hey
 in
 France
 when


they
 did
 this
 they
 lost
 like
 40%
 of


their
 revenue
 because
 all
 the
 wealth


left
 the
 country.
 The
 reality
 is
 that


this
 sets
 it
 up
 to
 go
 through
 the


legislature
 because
 if
 it
 goes
 through


the
 will
 of
 the
 people
 and
 it
 gets


overturned
 as
 you
 say
 Freeberg
 then
 if


you're
 legislatively
 smart
 then
 you'll


actually
 push
 it
 through
 the
 state


senate.


>> Oh
 but
 don't
 you
 remember
 no
 and
 then
 it


will
 not
 get
 vetoed
 like
 because
 then


it's
 like
 hey
 listen
 it's
 clear
 that
 the


people
 want
 this.


>> So
 I
 I
 think
 that
 you'll
 have
 some
 kind


of
 progressive
 taxation
 system
 that


conforms
 to
 the
 law.


>> I
 mean
 the
 one
 They're
 already
 trying
 to


extend
 Prop
 55,
 which
 is
 the
 progressive


tax
 for
 people
 making
 over
 a
 million


dollars.
 They're
 going
 to
 get
 that


passed.
 That's
 going to
 be
 this


incremental
 tax
 on
 income.
 But
 the


onetime
 wealth,


>> I
 think
 the
 I
 think
 the
 million
 dollars


thing,
 I
 think
 that's
 harder
 to
 hunt


because
 there's
 too
 many
 people
 that


that
 touches.
 A
 million
 dollars
 today
 in


2025,
 not
 to
 be
 glib,
 is
 just
 not
 what


it
 used
 to
 be.
 But
 a
 billion
 dollars


does
 cut
 off
 most
 people
 except
 for
 a


couple
 of
 hundred.
 That
 is
 true.
 And
 I


think
 that
 for
 example,
 it's
 very


reasonable
 to
 then
 charge
 a
 10%
 excise


tax
 on
 selling
 appreciated
 stock,


>> right?


>> Why
 not?
 There's
 all
 kinds
 of
 ways
 that


you
 can
 get
 billions
 and
 billions
 and


billions
 of
 dollars.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


think
 that
 this
 is
 more
 of
 a
 trial


balloon


>> to
 say,
 can
 we
 draw
 a
 clear
 line
 between


200
 Californians
 and
 the
 rest
 of


California?


>> Yeah.
 And
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 that
 bright


line
 becomes
 visible
 and
 it's
 okay,


people
 are
 going
 to
 go
 ham.
 They're


going
 to
 try
 to
 get
 as
 much
 as
 they
 can.


>> The
 reality
 is,
 as
 we
 all
 know,
 I
 mean,


Larry
 Ellison
 left
 the
 state.
 Many
 of


the
 founders
 CEOs
 who
 have
 built
 large


technology
 companies
 in
 California.
 Elon


left
 the
 state
 will
 eventually
 at
 some


point
 break
 and
 say,
 "Okay,
 I'm
 moving


my
 company
 out
 of
 state
 and
 I'm
 leaving


the
 state
 and
 I'm
 bringing
 the
 employees


with
 me
 and
 I'm
 bringing
 all
 of
 the


economic
 value
 of
 this
 business
 with


me."
 And
 people
 will
 never
 learn
 that


lesson
 because
 it's
 so
 much
 easier
 to


sit
 in
 front
 of
 a
 voter
 and
 say,
 "Hey,


should
 we
 tax
 these
 200
 people
 to
 give


you
 better
 benefits?"
 97%
 of
 people
 will


say,
 "Absolutely."


Very
 few
 people
 will
 sit
 and
 think
 about


the
 consequences
 of
 what's
 going
 to
 end


up
 happening.


>> 99.9
 will
 say
 absolutely.
 I
 mean,
 nobody


tells
 them
 in
 that
 ballot
 initiative


that
 we
 have
 a
 $300
 billion
 budget
 of


which
 2/3
 may
 be
 just
 wasted.
 One
 of
 the


motivations
 for
 this
 bill,
 and
 this
 is


why
 it's
 being
 proposed
 by
 the
 SEIU,
 is


that
 there
 are
 these
 massively


ballooning
 pension
 benefits
 and
 pretty


significant
 increases
 to
 the
 pension


programs
 for
 both
 private
 and
 public


pension
 funds
 in
 California,
 which
 has


actually
 become
 a
 very
 visible
 liability


for
 the
 state
 and
 for
 some
 of
 these


private
 pension
 programs.
 and
 they're


trying
 to
 fill
 the
 pension
 hole,
 which


we've
 talked
 about
 in
 the
 past,
 but


there
 is
 a
 multi-t
 trillion
 dollar


unaccounted
 for
 pension
 liability
 in


this
 country
 that's
 going
 to
 have
 to


come
 from
 somewhere.
 You're
 either
 going


to
 have
 to
 print
 the
 money
 because
 the


federal
 government's
 going
 to
 step
 in


and
 fill
 the
 hole
 in
 all
 these
 pension


obligations
 or
 they're
 going
 to
 have


these
 massively
 progressive
 tax
 programs


to
 try
 and
 fill
 the
 hole.
 And
 if
 and


when
 they
 do,
 as
 we
 all
 know,
 there
 will


be
 an
 economic
 cycle
 that
 will
 be
 pretty


nasty,
 which
 is
 all
 the
 value
 will
 leave


that
 jurisdiction
 and
 move
 elsewhere.


But
 let's
 see.


>> It's
 it's
 like
 the
 Democrats
 are
 doing


everything
 they
 can
 to
 get
 me
 to
 leave


the
 state.
 I
 don't
 want
 to.


I
 really
 am
 resisting.
 I
 mean,
 they've


raised
 my
 income
 tax
 to
 what
 is
 it
 like


13.3%.


>> 13.3.
 Yeah.


>> And
 I
 know
 it's
 going
 to
 16.
 They've


been
 boiling
 the
 frog.
 I
 still
 haven't


jumped
 out
 of
 the
 pot.
 But
 for
 me,
 I


think
 the
 wealth
 tax,
 I'm
 gonna
 have
 to


jump
 out
 of
 the
 pot
 with
 this.


>> The
 crazy
 thing
 with
 this,
 the
 other


like
 I
 read
 it
 because
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh


my
 god,
 what's
 going
 on?"
 The
 two
 things


that
 they
 they
 obviously
 got
 somebody


very
 clever
 to
 draft
 it
 because
 any
 Roth


IRA
 over
 10
 million
 counts.
 And
 normally


in
 these
 wealth
 calculations,
 you
 you


keep
 your
 deferred
 retirement
 accounts


off
 the
 table.
 They're
 typically
 not


included.
 So
 folks,
 and
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


say
 who
 they
 are.
 we
 all
 know
 who
 have


tremendously
 appreciated
 Roth
 IRAs


>> pretty
 public
 who
 you're
 talking
 about


but
 sure


>> those
 are
 included
 and
 then
 the
 other


thing
 is
 that
 if
 you
 actually
 did
 any


tax
 structuring
 the
 real
 valuable
 tax


structuring
 is
 where
 you
 set
 up
 these


trusts
 in
 Wyoming
 and
 North
 Dakota
 and


you
 do
 these
 interparty
 loans
 where
 you


can
 lever
 up
 10
 20x
 so
 you
 can
 transfer


billions
 and
 billions
 and
 billions
 of


dollars
 out
 of
 state
 but
 then
 you
 have


these
 obligations
 those
 are
 negated
 and


they
 don't
 count
 so
 all
 that
 tax


structuring
 goes
 out
 the


So
 you
 can
 get
 into
 a
 very
 difficult


situation
 here
 where
 they're
 like,
 "Hey,


you
 owe
 us
 $500
 million,
 a
 billion


dollar,
 $2
 billion,
 and
 the
 only
 way
 to


pay
 it
 is
 to
 have
 an
 IOU
 to
 the
 state
 of


California."
 Which
 is
 crazy.


>> It's
 crazy.
 There
 is
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 ways


out
 of
 this
 if
 this
 stance


>> No
 one
 is
 empathetic
 to
 either
 of
 you.


No
 one
 gives
 a
 about
 the
 two
 of
 you


needing
 to
 pay
 more.


>> This
 is
 why
 I'm
 in
 support.
 Again,
 I'm


just
 saying
 it
 for
 the
 record.
 I
 am


supporting
 support
 keep
 this


>> I
 had
 a
 few
 more
 thoughts
 about
 this


thing
 which
 I
 want
 to
 unpack.
 So
 number


one
 is
 like
 you
 guys
 said
 a
 wealth
 tax


has
 been
 tried
 in
 many
 places
 at
 many


times
 it
 always
 backfires
 because


whatever
 the
 tax
 benefit
 is
 that
 you
 get


for
 the
 state
 it's
 greatly
 outweighed
 by


the
 economic
 depression
 that
 you
 get
 by


the
 wealthy
 people
 the
 job
 creators


companies
 leaving.
 And
 as
 soon
 as
 you


cross
 that
 line
 of
 going
 from
 no
 wealth


tax
 to
 any
 wealth
 tax,
 enough
 people
 of


wealth
 can
 see
 the
 tea
 leaves,
 they
 can


see
 the
 writing
 on
 the
 wall
 that
 they


have
 to
 leave.
 And
 that's
 why
 I
 think


even
 if
 they
 say
 this
 is
 a
 one-time


thing,
 we
 all
 know
 that
 it
 won't
 be
 one


time.
 If
 they
 get
 away
 with
 it,
 it'll


become
 a
 regular
 thing.
 It'll
 just
 be


>> if
 it's
 to
 plug
 a
 deficit,
 they're
 going


to
 run
 deficits
 every
 year.


>> Exactly.
 And
 and
 you're
 right.
 And
 this


isn't
 even
 to
 plug
 an
 emergency


situation
 or
 an
 unfunded
 liability
 like


some
 one-time
 thing.
 This
 is
 just
 a


regular
 operating
 exactly.
 So
 they
 will


have
 no
 incentive
 to
 fix
 their


mismanagement
 of
 the
 state
 and
 their


deficits
 and
 all
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.


>> By
 the
 way,
 by
 the way,
 if
 they
 get
 away


with
 this


>> and
 it's
 not
 just
 going
 to
 be


billionaires
 eventually
 the
 line
 will
 of


course
 get
 pushed
 down
 be
 gone.
 The


billionaires
 always
 like
 like
 the
 income


tax
 in
 the
 US.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a
 1%


income
 tax
 originally
 and
 it
 was
 like


just
 a
 onetime
 thing
 for
 wealthy
 people


and
 then
 it
 became
 a
 smaller
 thing
 for


you
 know
 lower
 income
 people
 and
 then


eventually
 as
 we
 all
 know
 every
 person


has
 to
 pay
 a
 tax
 every
 property
 has
 tax


and
 so
 on.
 I
 mean
 these
 are
 this
 is
 the


problem
 with
 government.
 There's
 all


these
 other
 states
 by
 the
 way
 that
 are


finding
 clever
 ways.
 I
 think
 in
 Montana


now
 there's
 a
 differential
 property
 tax


scheme
 where
 if
 it's
 your
 second
 or


third
 home
 and
 you
 don't
 live
 there
 you


pay
 a
 lot
 more.
 Yeah,
 here's
 what
 I


wonder
 about
 is,
 you
 know,
 what
 are
 guys


like
 Jeffrey
 Katzenberg
 or
 even
 Ari


Emanuel
 thinking
 about
 right
 now
 because


they're
 kind
 of
 the
 higherups
 in
 the


Democratic
 party
 behind
 the
 machine,


sort
 of
 the
 oligopoly
 that
 kind
 of
 runs


the
 machine.
 And
 I
 remember
 that
 when


Karen
 Bass
 was
 running
 against
 Rick


Caruso
 for
 mayor
 of
 LA,
 it
 was
 very


publicly
 reported
 that
 Katsenberg
 was


behind
 Karen
 Bass
 and
 there
 was
 sort
 of


an
 imboglio
 between
 Caruso
 and


Katsenberg.
 Katsenberg
 anyway
 helped


make
 sure
 that
 Karen
 Bass
 was
 wellunded


enough
 to
 win.
 The
 result
 of
 that


ironically
 was
 that
 Pacific
 Palisades


burned
 down
 and
 I
 think
 Katzenberg's


house
 might
 have
 been
 part
 of
 that.
 In


any
 event,
 I
 think
 there
 are
 these
 guys


who
 are
 very,
 very
 wealthy
 who
 think


that
 they
 can
 control
 the
 machine
 well


enough
 that
 they
 basically
 are
 still
 in


control
 of
 this
 thing,
 right?
 That
 in


other
 words,
 that
 the
 tiger
 won't
 eat


them,
 right?
 The
 tiger
 is
 socialism.


>> Yes.


>> And
 that's
 exactly
 right.


>> You
 know,
 they
 think
 they've
 got
 the


tiger
 under
 control
 enough
 that
 it
 won't


eat
 them.
 But
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 do.


Maybe
 they
 don't.
 Maybe
 this
 is
 the


tiger
 breaking
 loose.


>> Yep.
 And
 I
 think
 Fer,
 you
 pointed
 this


out
 that
 there
 was
 an
 attempt
 in
 the


legislature
 last
 year
 to
 pass
 a
 wealth


tax
 and
 it
 was
 quietly
 killed
 behind
 the


scenes.
 And
 I
 actually
 think
 that
 Gavin


Newsome
 might
 have
 something
 to
 do
 with


that
 because
 he
 has
 presidential


ambitions.
 So
 he
 can't
 let
 the
 state
 go


full
 socialist.
 But
 you
 just
 kind
 of


wonder,
 okay,
 well,
 if
 these
 guys
 lose


control
 of
 the
 strings
 they
 have
 to


control
 the
 beast
 of
 socialism,
 does
 the


whole
 thing
 just
 spin
 out
 of
 control?


>> That's
 New
 York.
 We're
 seeing
 it


everywhere.
 Seattle.


>> I
 was
 about
 to
 bring
 up
 let's
 talk
 about


it.
 Uh
 well
 and
 and
 just
 to
 let
 people


know
 about
 the
 France
 situation
 back
 in


I
 don't
 know
 2011
 2012
 they
 did
 get
 rid


of
 Gerard
 de
 Parde
 which
 was
 kind
 of a


win
 but
 Bernard


>> Arnold


>> what's


Bernard
 Arnold
 is
 that
 his
 name
 from


LVMH


>> Bernard
 Arno
 said
 he
 was
 going
 to
 go
 to


Belgium
 and
 said
 it
 was
 a
 clerical
 error


and
 he
 unwound
 it
 but
 that
 was
 a
 clear


signal
 the
 richest
 man
 in
 France.
 Well,


he's


>> go
 to
 New
 York.


>> He's
 basically
 the
 entrepreneur
 LVMH


together.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 their
 biggest


company.
 It's
 the
 one
 that
 does
 all
 the


luxury
 goods,
 all
 the
 craft
 goods
 that


they're
 so
 famous
 for.
 I
 mean,
 yes,
 him


threatening
 to
 leave
 France
 is,
 you


know,


>> accidentally
 fly
 filing
 paperwork.
 Oops.


What
 an
 accident.
 Here's
 your
 look
 at
 uh


New
 York
 City
 under
 Mandami,
 who
 uh


we're
 in
 touch
 with.
 You
 may
 come
 on
 the


program.


New
 York
 State
 tax
 10.9%
 city
 3.876%


and
 the
 2%
 mandami
 tax
 put
 you
 at
 16.8%


for
 living
 in
 New
 York
 is
 17%.


I
 mean
 if
 you
 were
 making
 $10
 million
 a


year
 is
 it
 worth
 $1.7
 million?
 You
 could


get
 a
 plane.
 You
 could
 live
 in
 Florida.


You
 could
 come
 to
 New
 York
 150
 days
 a


year.
 There's
 really
 five
 good
 months
 in


New
 York.
 the
 fall,
 the
 spring,
 and


that's
 about
 it.
 You
 know,
 you
 go
 see


the
 tree
 at
 Christmas,
 but
 it's
 cold.


>> Well,
 that's
 not
 that's
 not
 that's
 not


realistic
 for
 most
 people.
 And


especially
 if
 you
 have
 kids
 and
 you
 care


about
 them,
 you'd
 like
 them
 to
 be
 rooted


somewhere.
 You're
 not
 going to
 shle
 them


around
 every
 month
 to
 arbitrage
 taxes.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 do
 think
 they're


they're
 going
 to
 test
 that
 at
 17%.


That's
 nondeminimous.
 Okay,
 let's
 uh
 we


got
 a
 lot
 of
 docket
 to
 get
 through
 here.


>> I'm
 so
 glad
 Shimov
 supports
 the


billionaires
 tax.
 That's
 great.
 We'll


get
 that
 in
 the
 headlines.
 Yeah.
 right


after
 all.
 This
 is
 the
 free
 rider


problem
 that
 we
 have
 is
 no
 one's
 going


to
 want
 to
 stand
 up
 against
 it
 and
 the


thing
 will
 just
 kind
 of


>> pass.
 By
 the
 way,
 if
 you're
 the
 if


you're
 a
 billionaire
 CEO
 of
 a
 public


company
 in
 California,


you
 have
 you
 have
 everything
 you
 have


everything
 to
 lose
 to
 stand
 up
 and


oppose
 it.
 Your
 employees
 will
 run.
 Your


shareholders
 will
 attack
 you.
 You'll


look
 awful
 in
 PR.
 So,
 everyone's
 going


to
 sit
 quietly
 and
 start
 looking
 at


houses
 on
 Zillow
 in
 Austin
 or
 Miami
 and


be
 like,
 "Where
 should
 we
 move
 to
 next


year,
 honey?"
 You
 know,
 like
 that's
 the


conversation
 that's
 going
 on.


>> Didn't
 you
 say
 it
 was
 retroactive?


What's


>> it's
 retroactive
 to
 2026?
 So,
 if
 it


passes,


>> you
 have
 three
 months.
 Two
 months.
 Yeah.


>> But
 again,
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 passes


muster
 with
 the
 constitutional
 reads.


>> Remember
 what
 they
 said
 about
 remember


when
 they
 did
 the
 transfer
 tax
 where
 San


Francisco
 took
 6%
 of
 my
 home?


>> Yep.


>> And
 then
 in
 LA
 just
 took
 5%
 of
 my
 house


down
 there,
 the
 supposed
 mansion
 tax.


>> But
 those
 those
 were
 excise
 taxes.
 So
 if


you
 go
 back
 to
 the
 case
 history
 in
 the


US
 Supreme
 Court
 on
 this
 stuff,
 anytime


there's
 a
 transaction
 and
 you
 take
 a
 tax


on
 a
 transaction,
 they
 call
 that
 an


excise
 tax
 that
 is
 constitutionally


>> part
 of
 the
 bill
 though
 there's
 a
 part


of
 the
 bill
 that
 they
 could
 cleverly
 use


which
 is
 called
 this
 ODA
 which
 is


effectively
 this
 IOU
 mechanism


>> and
 they
 could
 essentially
 say
 when


these
 assets
 transact
 you
 owe
 us
 5%
 on


an
 excise
 basis
 and
 by
 the
 way
 there's


an
 attestation
 that
 you
 have
 to
 file
 you


have
 to
 file
 a
 legal
 document
 and
 this


was
 quite
 well
 written
 in
 there
 which


said
 you
 must
 attest
 that
 you
 have
 less


than
 a
 billion
 dollars.


>> Okay,


now
 what?
 Okay,
 then
 I
 have
 to
 attest


that
 it's
 more
 and
 then
 I
 have
 to
 know


>> how
 do
 you
 even
 mark
 your
 whole


portfolio
 to
 market
 if
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of


privates?


>> They
 do
 not
 allow
 discounts.
 They
 do
 not


allow
 liquidity
 discounts.
 It
 says
 if


you
 are
 a
 reasonable
 buyer
 and
 a


reasonable
 seller,
 you
 have
 to
 transact


this
 at
 market
 price.
 So,
 for example,


imagine
 you
 owned
 a
 sports
 franchise
 and


the
 sports
 franchise,
 if
 you
 sell
 a


minority
 share,
 you're
 typically
 selling


it
 at
 a
 discount
 off
 the
 table.
 If
 Forb


says
 it's
 worth
 10
 billion
 and
 you
 own


10%,
 that's
 a
 billion
 dollars


>> for
 the
 purposes
 of
 this
 calculation.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 pay
 $50
 million
 to
 keep
 it


even
 if
 you
 paid
 50
 million
 to
 buy
 it.


>> Even
 if
 Freeberg
 is
 right
 that
 there's
 a


good
 chance
 that
 it'll
 be
 found


unconstitutional,
 how
 many
 years
 in
 the


course
 is
 that
 going
 to
 take?
 And
 who's


going
 to
 stick
 around
 waiting
 for
 that?


In
 fact,
 the
 rational
 thing
 to
 do
 is


pull
 up
 stakes
 before
 January
 1st
 and


leave
 right
 now.


>> That's
 right.
 That's
 going
 to
 happen
 in


New
 York.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 they're
 going


to
 have
 an
 exodus
 just
 like
 New
 Jersey


and
 Connecticut
 did.
 And
 that
 actually


rocked
 the
 tax
 base
 in
 those
 two


geographies.
 All right,
 listen.


Big
 breaking
 news
 this
 morning.
 Huge


scandal
 in
 the
 NBA.
 The
 FBI
 just


arrested
 30
 people
 in
 a
 sports
 betting


and
 gambling
 probe.
 This
 hardly
 seems


real.
 Chanty
 Bilips,
 who
 is
 the
 current


Blazers
 coach
 and
 was
 just
 introduced


into
 the
 Hall
 of
 Fame,
 got
 pinched
 for
 a


poker
 game
 he
 was
 running
 allegedly
 with


the
 mafia
 that
 was
 rigged
 17
 different


ways
 allegedly
 to
 Sunday.
 Terry
 Rosir


allegedly
 is
 a
 point
 guard
 for
 the
 Miami


Heat.


>> Why
 are
 you
 saying
 allegedly
 all
 the


time?


>> I'm,
 you
 know,
 everybody's
 suing
 these


days,
 so
 alleged
 I'm
 I
 allegedly
 he's
 a


point
 guard.
 I
 I've
 seen
 him
 play.
 He's


not
 a
 very
 good
 point
 guard.
 It's
 a
 lot


of
 turnovers
 if
 I'm
 being
 honest.
 You


know
 what
 I
 know
 is
 alleged?
 That
 you're


the
 world's
 greatest
 moderator.
 That's


>> allegedly
 true.
 It's
 allegedly
 true
 cuz


it's
 not
 true.


>> You're
 allegedly
 a
 billionaire.
 Nobody


can
 confirm
 it.


>> Normally,
 he
 uses
 the
 word
 allegedly


when
 it's
 a
 story
 that
 like
 it's
 about


Hunter
 Biden
 or
 doing
 something


improper.


>> Yes,
 he
 allegedly
 smoked
 crack
 and
 shot


a
 9
 mm
 in
 the
 air.


>> It's
 usually
 a
 story
 about
 Democrat


wrongdoing
 and
 he's
 trying
 to
 discredit


it.


>> All right,
 here
 we
 go.


>> Anyway,
 keep
 going.
 Curry
 Rosair,
 uh,


who's
 allegedly
 a
 point
 guard.
 I
 mean,


he
 he
 was


he
 told
 his
 friends,
 this
 is
 crazy,
 you


know,
 in
 the
 overunders,
 you
 know,
 hey


guys,
 bet
 the
 under
 on
 me
 uh
 in
 rebounds


cuz
 I'm
 going
 to
 uh
 take
 myself
 out
 of


the
 game
 with
 an
 injury
 allegedly.
 And


uh


his
 friends
 allegedly
 made
 200
 grand
 off


this.
 Okay,
 just
 allegedly
 for
 the
 whole


goddamn
 thing.
 Uh
 this
 is
 going
 across


11
 states
 and
 a
 bunch
 of
 crime
 families.


Allegedly,
 there's
 something
 called
 the


mob.
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 really
 exists


anymore.
 I
 think
 that's
 an
 urban
 legend.


And
 these
 are
 two
 separate
 threads,
 but


announced
 on
 the
 same
 day.
 They
 both


involve
 NBA
 players,
 but
 apparently
 this


is
 two
 different
 cases.
 So,
 Chimath,


what
 do
 you
 allegedly
 think
 of
 this?


I
 I
 think
 it's
 crazy.
 I
 think
 you're


seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 trends
 converge


all
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 Meaning,
 you
 have


the
 emergence
 of
 all
 of
 these
 prediction


markets.
 you
 have


a
 lot
 of
 data
 science
 and
 AI
 being
 used


that
 shows
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 odd


behaviors.
 So,
 it
 really
 was
 the
 squares


versus
 the
 sharps.
 And
 if
 you
 had
 the


inside
 edge,
 you
 were
 just
 printing


money.
 Now
 that
 all
 of
 that
 is
 becoming


more
 transparent,
 there's
 a
 lot
 less


margin.
 Then
 what
 happens
 is
 you
 have


these
 laws
 passed
 in
 the
 11th
 hour.


There
 was
 a
 an
 important
 gambling
 law


that
 was
 inserted
 into
 the
 big
 beautiful


bill
 that
 has
 implications
 to
 all
 of


this.
 And
 now
 you're
 seeing
 the
 feds.
 I


The
 crazy
 thing
 to
 me
 is


a
 press
 conference
 where
 Cash
 Patel
 is


talking
 about
 this.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 like


serious
 business
 when
 the
 FBI
 director


is
 front
 and
 center
 talking
 about
 all


this.
 So,
 I
 don't
 really
 know
 what
 it


means
 to
 be
 honest.
 I
 was
 shocked
 at
 the


scale
 of
 it
 and
 I
 was
 shocked
 that
 it's


on
 the
 radar
 of
 the
 feds.
 This
 took
 I


thought
 this
 is
 like
 pretty
 typical


tickytacky
 stuff,
 but
 clearly
 there's


something
 bigger.
 I
 don't
 know
 exactly


what
 that
 bigger
 is,
 but
 something
 is


happening
 where
 all
 these
 markets
 are


smashing
 together.
 There's
 just
 a
 big


cleanup
 effort
 going
 on.
 So,
 I
 don't


know.
 I
 really
 don't
 know.


>> Freeberg,
 I
 guess
 there's
 two
 different


ways
 to
 go
 about
 this.
 You
 have
 the


fantasy
 sports
 becoming
 legal,
 everybody


around
 these
 players
 just
 in
 that
 one


case


where
 are
 these
 people
 too
 dumb
 to


understand
 that
 their
 $10
 million


contract
 to
 play
 in
 the
 NBA
 every
 year


or
 $20
 million
 contract
 is
 more


important
 than
 your
 friends
 betting
 the


under
 or
 over.


And
 how
 dumb
 are
 they?
 I
 mean,
 to
 not


know
 that
 the
 people
 running
 a
 sports


book
 would
 look
 for
 weird
 action.
 like


why
 is
 one
 player
 getting
 $200,000
 on


their
 overunder
 for
 rebounds
 and
 the


other
 players
 are
 getting
 20,000?
 What


are
 what
 are
 your
 thoughts
 here?
 Us
 also


take
 on
 the
 poker
 one.


>> I
 think
 gambling
 generally
 as
 we
 call
 it


should
 be
 decriminalized
 and
 I
 don't


like
 this
 statebystate
 setup
 with


gambling.
 I
 think
 we
 should
 have
 a


federal
 regulatory
 body
 to
 oversee,


monitor,
 and
 the
 problem
 is
 you
 have


state
 gambling
 commissions
 and
 we
 have
 a


state-by-state
 kind
 of
 patchwork
 of


regulatory
 authority
 that
 makes
 it
 very


hard
 to
 standardize,
 track,
 and
 provide


also
 guidance
 and
 feedback.
 I
 would
 much


rather
 see
 this
 all
 kind
 of
 get
 handled


at
 the
 federal
 level
 and
 and
 better


organized.
 To
 Chimat's
 point,
 this
 is


not
 going
 away.
 People
 love
 to
 bet
 on


stuff.
 They
 love
 to
 gamble.
 This
 is
 part


of
 sports.
 This
 is
 part
 of
 the
 culture.


They're
 not
 going
 to
 just
 turn
 it
 off.


>> They
 did
 market
 poly
 market
 raised


whatever
 it
 was
 a
 billion
 or
 two
 billion


at
 9
 billion.


>> Then
 the
 next
 weekend
 they
 announced


sports
 betting


>> and
 now
 they're
 raising
 money
 30
 days


later.
 It
 allegedly


>> allegedly


>> at
 12
 to
 15
 billion.
 I
 mean
 anywhere.


>> It's
 un
 it's
 unbelievable.
 And
 you
 can


see
 by
 the
 way
 the
 way
 that
 DraftKings


and
 FanDuel
 stock


have
 reacted
 to
 this.
 Those
 companies


are
 toast.


>> Toast.


>> That's
 right.
 This
 is
 really


interesting.


>> The
 poly
 market
 model
 is
 the
 best
 model


because
 it
 creates
 a
 market
 and
 so
 as


information
 flows
 in
 that
 market
 will


dynamically
 adjust
 and
 everyone
 will
 get


a
 more
 fair
 price.


>> Did
 you
 see
 the
 regression
 that
 they
 did


on
 the
 poly
 market
 trades
 and
 how
 well


they're
 in
 the
 money?


>> Y
 Nick,
 can
 you
 find
 that?
 But
 basically


what
 it
 showed
 is
 like
 the
 front
 money


is
 the
 sharps,


the
 back
 money
 are
 the
 squares,
 but
 you


have
 to
 fade
 the
 trade
 in
 the
 first


week.
 So
 there's
 a
 very
 scientific


method
 where
 if
 you
 want
 to
 make
 money


on
 poly
 market,
 it
 became
 pretty
 clear.


There's
 two
 things
 that
 are
 very


interesting
 about
 it
 is
 number
 one
 how


how
 they've
 simplified
 things
 to
 a
 way


people
 can
 understand.
 It's
 not
 like
 you


have
 to
 understand,
 you
 know,
 it's
 120,


it's
 this
 the
 point
 spread.
 It's
 just


what
 are
 the
 what's
 the
 chance
 that
 this


thing
 happens?
 80%
 20%
 people
 could
 just


place
 their
 money
 on
 it.
 And
 then
 this


ability
 to
 reconcile
 it
 at
 any
 time.
 I


didn't
 realize
 how
 engaging
 that
 is.
 I


was
 watching
 the
 Oscars
 and
 I
 was


watching
 boxing
 and
 I
 bet
 the
 underdog


in
 this
 Netflix
 boxing
 thing
 that


happened
 cuz
 I
 just
 thought
 this
 guy


looks
 pretty
 pissed
 off.
 Uh,
 and
 I


thought
 that
 was
 a
 good
 enough
 way
 to
 go


with
 the
 underdog.
 And
 then
 you
 watch
 it


round
 after
 round
 and
 you
 see
 the
 odds


changing
 real
 time
 and
 anytime
 you
 can


just
 cover
 the
 bat
 and
 take
 your


winnings
 and
 take
 out
 the
 risk.
 Really


like
 interesting
 and
 fun
 for
 people.


It's
 so
 simple.
 Then
 I
 did
 it
 on
 the


Oscars
 or
 the
 Emmys
 and
 I
 was
 like,


"Yeah,
 I'm
 going
 to
 I'm
 I'm
 fading
 uh
 no


offense
 Pen
 Stiller,
 but
 I'm
 going
 to


fade
 Severance."
 And
 I
 went
 with
 the
 um


the
 uh
 the
 one
 about
 the
 emergency
 rooms


and
 with
 Andor
 and
 I
 won
 again.
 So,
 I'm


just
 it's
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 fun
 to
 do
 it


>> here.
 Jason,
 look
 at
 this.
 I
 sent
 Nick


the
 tweet,
 but
 this
 is
 incredibly


systematic.
 This
 is
 over
 many
 many
 many


markets.
 But
 basically,
 89%
 accurate
 one


week
 out,
 but
 in
 the
 final
 four
 hours,


it
 jumps
 to
 95,
 which
 means
 that
 if
 you


follow
 the
 sharps
 along
 this
 pattern,


you're
 going
 to
 make
 money.


>> 6%
 in
 a
 week.


>> Yeah.
 Right.


>> Market
 Poly
 Market
 actually
 has
 the
 news


before
 the
 news
 does.
 This
 is
 one
 of
 the


most
 like
 powerful
 outputs
 of
 Poly


Market
 is
 they're
 actually
 getting
 a


read
 on
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 world


before
 the
 media
 recognizes
 it,
 before


the
 public
 recognizes
 it.
 Because
 when


you
 put


>> Yeah.
 When
 you
 put
 money
 up,
 it
 actually


turns
 out
 that
 when
 people
 have


incentives,
 that
 market
 will
 find
 the


truth.


>> Somebody
 needs
 to
 build
 the
 app
 that


makes
 all
 of
 these
 things
 fungeible.
 And


by
 all
 what
 I
 mean
 are
 cryptocurrencies,


betting
 markets,
 equities,
 and
 options


markets
 turning
 into.


>> Yeah.
 And
 the
 reason
 is
 there's
 just
 no


reason
 to
 go
 to
 nine
 different
 sites
 and


have
 nine
 different
 accounts.
 And
 the


most
 important
 thing
 is
 to
 do
 KYC
 and


AML
 across
 nine
 sites
 to
 get
 access
 to


liquidity,
 credit,
 and
 margin.
 You'll


want
 to
 do
 it
 once.
 And
 then
 you'll
 want


to
 have
 a
 large
 pool
 of
 capital
 that
 you


can
 trade
 across
 anything.
 So
 I
 can
 go


long
 Nvidia
 but
 I
 can
 also
 go
 short
 the


nicks
 and
 then
 I
 can
 own
 some
 Bitcoin


all
 in
 the
 same
 trade.


>> Totally.


>> That's
 where
 it's
 going.


>> Totally.
 Totally.


>> Now
 to
 the
 earlier
 question
 Jcal
 I
 think


if
 we
 end
 up
 there
 where
 poly
 market


does
 become
 the
 truly
 liquid
 market


across
 all
 of
 these
 kind
 of
 predictions


all
 of
 these
 assets
 then
 a
 lot
 of
 what


we
 are
 seeing
 with
 respect
 to
 insider


trading
 insider
 information
 becomes
 much


more
 apparent.
 So,
 the
 problem
 with
 the


sports
 betting
 is
 that
 there's
 a


one-sided
 bet.
 The
 casino
 sets
 the
 odds


or,
 you
 know,
 whomever
 is
 setting
 the


odds,
 and
 then
 you're
 either
 taking
 one


side
 or
 the
 other.
 And
 so,
 if
 you
 have


the
 insider
 information,
 you're
 taking


the
 side
 that
 creates
 an
 arbitrage


opportunity
 for
 you.


>> But
 if
 you
 were
 to
 do
 that
 in
 a
 liquid


market
 where
 there's
 someone
 taking
 the


other
 side
 in
 a
 dynamic
 way,
 then
 the


market
 very
 quickly
 moves
 because
 of
 the


inside
 knowledge
 you
 have.
 And
 that


inside
 knowledge
 is
 now
 reflected
 in
 the


underlying
 asset
 price
 in
 the
 underlying


odds
 that
 you
 get
 for
 that
 bet.
 And
 so


Poly
 Market
 actually
 brings
 truth
 and


transparency
 to
 what
 is
 currently
 an


insider
 arbitrage
 opportunity
 and
 it
 may


actually
 solve
 some
 of
 these
 fundamental


problems
 in
 in
 gambling.


>> I
 think
 let's
 just
 wrap
 with
 a
 little


bit
 on
 the
 poker
 and
 knowing
 if
 you're


in
 a
 rigged
 game
 or
 not.
 uh
 living
 in
 LA


I
 got
 invited
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 poker
 games


when
 I
 was
 playing
 low
 stakes
 playing
 at


Hollywood
 Park
 just
 you
 know
 $500
 buy
 in


thousand
 buy
 in
 but
 as
 these
 things
 went


up
 you
 started
 to
 get
 access
 and
 I


started
 to
 get
 invited
 to
 Molly's
 game


the
 very
 infamous
 game
 and
 she
 would


text
 me
 she
 would
 call
 me
 oh
 we're


playing
 over
 here
 oh
 Leo
 this
 person


wants
 to
 see
 that
 person
 wants
 to
 see
 I


was
 like
 they
 want
 to
 see
 me
 lose
 50


grand
 there's
 no
 way
 I'm
 not
 playing
 in


that
 high
 stakes
 and
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


that
 game
 and
 the
 one
 or
 two
 times
 I
 did


go
 to
 games
 that
 had
 a
 rake
 I
 was
 just


like
 This
 game
 is
 fixed.
 I
 don't
 know


how.


>> Totally.


>> But
 somebody's
 I
 think
 it's
 just


collusion.
 I
 think
 there's
 three
 players


all
 playing
 from
 the
 same
 chip
 stack.
 In


which
 case,
 you
 know,
 you
 could
 be
 dealt


aces
 five
 times
 in
 a
 row.
 If
 you're
 up


against
 three
 players,
 what
 are
 your


odds
 against,
 you
 know,
 six
 other
 cards?


It's
 going
 to
 be
 pretty
 bad
 for


>> you
 think
 Molly's
 game
 was
 fixed.


>> I
 don't
 know
 if
 hers
 were
 was
 I
 wouldn't


be
 surprised
 if
 it
 was.
 I
 wouldn't
 be


because
 once
 the
 mob
 gets
 involved,


which
 is
 what
 happened
 at
 the
 tail
 end


of
 hers,
 then
 all
 kinds
 of
 possibilities


happen.
 Once
 it
 gets
 to
 extremely
 high


stakes
 and
 you've
 got
 guys
 chasing
 it,


man,
 you
 could,
 you
 know,
 and
 they're


coming
 back
 night
 after
 night
 trying
 to


catch
 up
 for
 what
 they
 lost
 last
 week,


it's
 it's
 pretty
 dark.
 There
 is


absolutely
 no
 reason
 why
 anybody
 should


play
 in
 a
 game
 where
 you're
 playing
 with


people
 you
 don't
 know.
 And
 if
 you
 need


it
 that
 badly,
 then
 you
 probably
 have
 a


problem.
 But
 there
 is
 no
 limit
 at
 which


you
 couldn't
 find
 a
 game
 with
 some


combination
 of
 your
 friends
 and
 or


respectable
 reputable
 businessmen
 that


have
 more
 to
 lose
 than
 you
 do.
 And
 if


you
 can't
 find
 that
 game,
 you
 should
 not


be
 playing
 in
 any
 game.


>> Yeah.
 Any
 home
 game
 with
 a
 rake
 is
 just


should
 be
 absolutely
 suspect.
 Period.


Stop.
 Super
 sketch.


>> Isn't
 that
 game?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 yeah.
 Well,
 we
 don't
 want
 to


bring
 up
 angle
 shooting,
 but
 he's
 a


straight
 play.


He
 would
 be
 so
 tilted
 if
 he
 hurt heard


you
 so
 well.


>> Oh
 my
 god.
 He's
 so
 about
 the
 ethics.
 He


wants,
 you
 know,
 no
 flies.


>> In
 fairness
 to
 like
 that
 game
 where
 you


can,
 you
 know,
 go
 off
 for
 a
 small
 house


in
 is
 also
 the
 game
 where
 he
 would
 then


collect
 $10
 from
 each
 of
 us
 to
 pay
 for


the


>> fruit
 plate
 and
 the
 pizza.
 He
 would


order
 Domino
 wouldn't
 even
 buy
 us
 pizza.


>> Yeah.
 The
 chef
 and
 but
 I'm
 like
 I
 don't


know if
 the
 chef
 really
 does
 cost
 $6,000


for
 two
 hours,
 bro.
 I
 don't
 know.


>> It's
 Wagu.
 But
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 Wagu


burger.
 The
 the
 funniest
 ever
 was
 he's


like
 in
 a
 hand
 and
 the
 Domino's
 pizza


comes
 and
 you
 know
 he's
 like
 everybody


have
 a
 green
 chip
 when
 we're
 playing


with
 fin
 chips.
 He's
 trying
 to
 get
 like


$125
 bucks.
 The
 guy
 comes
 I
 just
 go
 it's


on
 card.
 The
 guys
 got
 you
 got
 a
 sign


right?
 It's
 got
 the
 tip
 on
 it.
 I
 said
 uh


it's
 like
 $150
 a
 piece.
 I
 said
 what's


the
 most
 what's
 the
 biggest
 tip
 you
 ever


got?
 He
 said
 yeah
 somebody
 on
 New
 Year's


gave
 me
 like
 200
 bucks.
 I
 just
 wrote


$500
 on
 $150
 thing.
 I
 signed
 it.
 I
 gave


it
 to
 him
 and
 then
 I
 was
 in
 a
 hand
 with


I
 said
 here's
 the
 receipt.


>> So
 what
 you're
 saying
 is
 when
 it's
 on


somebody
 else's
 credit
 card
 you're


willing
 to
 tip
 incredibly
 generously.


>> I
 mean


>> God
 you're
 a
 really
 great
 guy.


>> You
 should
 speak
 when
 Phil
 Helmouth
 and


I
 bought
 uh
 dinner
 for
 everybody
 at


Chipriani
 that
 time.
 Chimop
 grabs
 the


check.
 He
 goes,
 "I'll
 put
 the
 tip
 in
 for


you
 guys."


>> Well,
 why
 is
 that,
 Jason?
 Is
 that


because
 100%
 tip
 on
 an
 $8,000
 check?


>> Isn't
 that
 because
 I
 pay
 for
 everything


all
 the
 time?


>> That's
 true.
 You
 are
 very
 generous.
 It's


You're
 no
 um
 or
 no,
 sir.
 20
 2010


>> one
 time.
 I
 asked
 you
 guys
 in
 15
 years


to
 pay
 one
 time
 and
 you
 remember
 the


exact
 It's
 so
 sad.


>> I
 have


on
 you
 guys.


>> I
 was
 like, "Oh
 god,
 I
 guess
 we're
 going


to
 public
 school."


>> You
 guys
 are
 so
 ungenerous.
 It's


>> I
 know.
 I
 I
 give
 huge
 tips.
 Um


Yeah,
 I
 think
 he's,
 you
 know,
 he's


average.


>> Okay,
 let's
 go
 to
 the
 next
 topic.


Allegedly,
 world's
 greatest
 moderator.


>> Let's
 talk
 about
 this
 Amazon
 outage.


Tough
 week
 for
 Amazon.
 They
 had
 this


huge
 outage
 in
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 week


and
 then
 they
 had
 a
 bunch
 of
 leaked


documents
 about
 their
 plans
 for
 uh
 jobs.


And
 uh
 Monday,
 massive
 AWS
 outage,
 2,000


companies,
 4
 million
 users
 unable
 to


function
 on
 the
 internet
 for
 half
 a
 day,


15
 hours,
 20
 hours.
 Uh
 and
 then
 on


Tuesday,
 internal
 docs
 viewed
 by
 the
 New


York
 Times
 showed
 Amazon
 plans
 to
 not


hire
 uh
 600,000
 plan
 jobs
 uh
 because
 of


robots
 by
 2033.


So
 this
 isn't
 they're
 planning
 on
 laying


off
 600,000
 workers,
 but
 rather
 they're


just
 pulling
 back
 their
 hiring
 plans
 and


ramping
 up
 their
 robotic
 plans,
 which


you
 would
 expect.
 uh
 and
 uh
 their
 goal


according
 to
 these
 internal
 leak


documents
 is
 to
 automate
 75%
 of


warehouse
 operations.
 We
 talked
 about


this
 the
 last
 couple
 of
 weeks.
 Freeberg,


your
 thoughts
 on
 either
 of
 these
 uh
 two


stories
 here?


>> I
 think
 the
 AWS
 story
 is
 interesting
 in


terms
 of
 its
 implications
 for
 the


clouds.
 There's
 effectively
 three
 major


cloud
 vendors
 that
 compete
 with
 one


another.
 AWS,
 Microsoft,
 and
 GCP
 or


Google
 Cloud.
 And
 I'll
 just
 give
 you


these
 numbers.


>> Also,
 by
 the
 way,
 coming
 on
 strong.


Yeah,


>> that's
 right.
 But
 let's
 let's
 exclude


the
 number
 four
 for
 now.
 Oracle,
 but
 AWS


is
 $124
 billion
 revenue
 run
 rate.


>> Microsoft
 120
 billion.
 And
 Google
 Cloud


54
 billion.
 But
 AWS,
 which
 is
 slightly


larger
 than
 Microsoft,
 is
 only
 growing


17%
 year-over-year.
 Microsoft
 26%


year-over-year.
 And
 Google
 Cloud
 is


accelerating
 at
 32%
 year-over-year.
 And


some
 say
 getting
 closer
 to
 40%
 growth


rate.
 The
 big
 thing
 I
 hear
 from
 partners


and
 enterprise
 customers
 of
 these
 cloud


services
 is
 that
 many
 of
 them
 if
 not
 all


of
 them
 as
 they
 scale
 up
 move
 to
 a


multicloud
 model.
 So
 none
 of
 them
 want


to
 be
 dependent
 on
 a
 single
 cloud.
 Many


folks
 started
 on
 AWS
 because
 AWS
 was
 the


OG.
 Back
 in
 the
 day
 when
 I
 was
 running


Climate
 Corp,
 I
 was
 the
 largest
 EC2
 user


on
 AWS
 for
 about
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half,


which
 was
 their
 elastic
 compute
 cloud


service.
 We
 were
 running
 all
 these


models
 back
 then.
 So
 I
 knew
 that
 service


very
 early
 on
 and
 it
 was
 very
 unique.
 It


was
 very
 powerful
 and
 so
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 that
 are
 old
 school


established
 themselves
 on
 AWS
 very
 early


on.
 But
 the
 outage
 that
 happened
 this


week,
 I
 think
 starts
 to
 highlight
 for


folks
 that
 they
 can't
 and
 shouldn't
 have


a
 dependency
 on
 a
 single
 cloud
 service


provider
 and
 will
 only
 accelerate
 the


diversification
 of
 companies
 into
 the


other
 clouds.
 And
 so
 I
 do
 think
 this
 is


actually
 a
 very
 beneficial
 situation
 for


Microsoft
 and
 GCP
 and
 to
 your
 point


Jakel
 perhaps
 even
 Oracle
 in
 terms
 of


giving
 those
 sales
 teams
 which
 are
 very


aggressive
 a
 hard
 story
 to
 go
 and
 sell


for
 and
 say
 guys
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 just


sit
 on
 AWS
 in
 case
 this
 happens
 again


we've
 got
 better
 infrastructure
 we're


more
 reliable
 etc
 than
 these
 other
 guys


so
 come
 and
 move
 over
 to
 us
 and
 that


might
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 naive


simplistic
 kind
 of
 reductive
 way
 to


think
 about
 what
 happened
 this
 week
 but


I
 we
 are
 seeing
 the
 smaller
 competitors


accelerate
 and
 I
 think that
 this
 might


be
 another
 kind
 of
 moment
 of


acceleration
 for
 those
 folks


>> and
 multicloud
 it's
 been
 around
 for
 a


while
 Jimoth
 when
 you're
 doing
 stuff


with
 8090


are
 the
 big
 companies
 already
 doing
 that


or
 do
 they
 assume
 hey
 there's
 going
 to


be
 some
 downtime


yeah
 it's
 okay
 to
 risk
 or
 are
 they


really
 thinking
 multicloud
 neocloud


let's
 have
 some
 smart
 intelligent


routing
 and
 redundancy
 here


>> I
 think
 there
 are
 two
 markets
 there's


the
 AI
 market
 then
 there's
 the
 non-AI


market.
 In
 the
 nonAI
 market,


everybody
 has
 everything.
 It
 all
 looks


effectively
 the
 same.
 There's
 certain


products
 and
 services
 that
 are
 unique
 to


Azure
 versus
 GCP
 versus
 AWS,
 but
 by
 and


large,
 the
 market
 is
 big
 enough
 and


important
 enough
 that
 you'd
 have
 to
 be


pretty
 insane
 to
 take
 a
 single
 vendor


approach.


And
 so
 what
 typically
 happens
 in
 these


markets
 is
 that
 they
 start
 off
 really


small.
 One
 person
 has
 all
 the
 share.
 And


then
 as
 the
 market
 becomes
 very
 valuable


and
 very
 big,
 everybody
 diversifies


because
 it's
 a
 riskmanagement
 thing.
 And


these
 things
 flow
 into
 the
 disclosures


you
 have
 to
 make
 as
 a
 public
 company.


And
 if
 you
 didn't
 have
 that


diversification
 and
 something
 bad


happened
 and
 it
 impacted
 your
 business,


you
 could
 get
 sued.
 So
 there's
 all
 these


reasons
 why
 eventually
 all
 these
 three


big
 companies
 will
 converge
 effectively


roughly
 a
 third,
 a
 third,
 a
 third.
 We're


going
 to
 debate
 the
 path
 to
 get
 there,


but
 that's
 where
 they'll
 end
 up.


>> You
 know,
 there's
 this
 principle
 called


the
 rule
 of
 three
 where
 they
 say
 like


all
 markets
 eventually
 mature
 to
 kind
 of


a
 60
 3010
 split
 that
 you
 end
 up
 having


your
 market
 leader
 at
 60%
 market
 share.


Second
 place
 is
 usually
 half
 the
 size
 at


30
 and
 then
 you
 always
 there's
 some


balance
 in
 the
 market
 where
 there's
 some


competitor
 that
 resolves
 to
 about
 a
 10%.


It's
 really
 interesting.
 If
 you
 guys


were
 to
 place
 a
 bet,
 who
 would
 you
 think


is
 the
 60
 3010?


>> I
 don't
 think
 that
 applies
 to
 you.
 I


think
 that's


>> You
 think
 they're
 going to
 be
 a
 third,
 a


third,
 a
 third?


>> I
 think
 it's
 all
 some
 idiot
 making


something
 up.


>> But
 what
 do
 you
 think?
 What
 do
 you


think?
 What
 do
 you
 think
 happens
 in


cloud?
 Like,
 do
 you
 think
 that
 these
 all


converge
 to
 equal
 market
 share?


>> In
 nonAI,
 it's
 a
 third,
 a
 third,
 a


third.
 It
 will
 it'll
 take
 circuitous


paths,
 but
 that's
 where
 we'll
 end
 up.


>> By
 the
 way,
 a
 good
 point
 to
 make
 is
 that


this
 revenue
 number
 that
 I
 highlighted


for
 Google
 Cloud,
 Microsoft,
 and
 Amazon


actually
 include
 their
 applications.
 So


as
 you
 know
 like
 Microsoft
 GCP
 have


pretty
 sizable
 enterprise
 application


stacks
 that
 are
 built
 into
 that
 number


which
 gives
 them
 obviously
 the
 ability


to
 drive
 cloud
 usage
 because
 they've
 got


demand
 and
 sales
 relationships
 into


those
 enterprises.
 I
 think
 the
 way
 it


works
 in
 AI
 is
 that
 you
 initially
 right


now
 we're
 in
 this
 early
 phase
 where


there's
 two
 paths.
 Path
 one
 is
 you
 need


a
 specific
 model
 and
 it's
 relatively


well
 integrated
 using
 a
 specific


subsidized
 form
 of
 hardware
 on
 one
 of


the
 hyperscalers
 but
 eventually
 you'll


get
 more
 of
 that
 abstracted
 away
 as
 it


gets
 pushed
 into
 the
 infrastructure
 so


that
 you
 have
 less
 dependence
 on
 one


model.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 that
 has
 to


get
 done
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 in-memory


infrastructure
 that
 is
 not
 yet
 built


that
 has
 to
 exist
 but
 once
 that
 exists


it'll
 be
 easier
 for
 all
 of
 us
 at
 the


application
 level
 to
 view
 these
 models
 a


little
 bit
 more
 funly
 and
 then
 at
 the


bleeding
 edge
 you'll
 have
 the
 folks
 that


basically
 give
 you
 some
 form
 of
 a


hypervisor
 or
 virtual
 machine
 or
 the


bare
 metal
 and
 that's
 where
 the


neocalers
 are
 doing
 really
 well
 but
 I


think
 my
 point
 is
 that
 in
 any
 important


market


in
 compute
 in
 technology
 where
 there


really
 isn't
 much
 of
 a
 differentiation
 I


think
 you'll
 end
 up
 with
 these


hyperscalers
 at
 a
 third
 a
 third
 a
 third


now
 if
 one
 model
 is
 way
 way
 better
 and


it's
 only
 on
 one
 of
 the
 clouds
 because


Google
 writes
 a
 big
 check
 or
 Amazon


writes
 a
 big
 check
 I
 could
 see
 that


swaying
 the
 AI
 share
 but
 in
 the
 absence


of
 that
 I
 think
 cheaper
 faster
 better
 is


sort
 of
 the
 the
 the
 end
 destination
 for


everybody


>> what
 an
 extraordinary
 outcome
 for
 Amazon


on
 where
 AWS
 is
 like
 15%
 of
 their


revenue
 right
 now
 Freeberg
 but
 it's
 60%


of
 their
 profits
 profits
 today
 and
 that


was
 just
 a
 side
 hustle
 like
 a
 little


project
 they
 took
 out
 of
 nowhere
 and


it's
 it's
 having
 the
 same
 impact
 on


Google
 and
 other
 places
 so
 side
 bets


>> and
 side
 quests
 are
 just
 you
 look
 at
 the


Whimo
 Side
 Quest
 for
 Google
 or
 even
 a


lot
 of
 Sergey's
 other
 bets
 like
 um
 and


Larry
 Flying
 Cars
 Looms
 low
 earth


satarites
 Google
 Google
 fiber
 all
 those


ex
 projects
 were
 so
 they
 had
 so
 much


potential
 in
 this


>> TPU,
 Deep
 Mind,
 TensorFlow,
 GFS,


>> Robotics,


Boston
 Robotics,
 they
 bought
 all
 those


robotics
 companies,
 man.
 It's
 like


somebody
 got
 to
 them
 and
 we're
 like,


"Yeah,
 you
 know,
 you're
 seven,
 eight


years
 into
 this,
 it
 didn't
 happen."


>> The
 problem
 that
 Google
 has,


unfortunately,
 is
 like
 they
 have
 so
 much


stuff,


>> it's
 not
 really
 valued.
 And
 so
 they're


going
 to
 go
 through
 the
 same
 problem


that
 everybody
 else
 who's
 a
 conglomerate


has,
 which
 is
 this
 decision.
 Now


Buffett,
 when
 he
 got
 to
 that
 decision,


said,
 "I
 don't
 care.
 This
 is
 my
 life's


work,
 and
 so
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 keep


everything
 aggregated."
 But
 now
 you're


going
 to
 get
 to
 this
 thing
 where
 the


intrinsic
 value
 of
 everything
 they
 have


will
 far
 exceed
 the
 actual
 value
 that
 it


trades
 at.
 And
 so
 there'll
 always
 be


these
 fissures
 of
 pressure.
 And
 then
 if


one
 of
 these
 things
 requires
 a
 lot
 of


money,
 there'll
 be
 pressure
 and
 that


pressure
 will
 be
 segregate
 these
 things


so
 that
 I
 can
 own
 one
 versus
 the
 other.


And
 that's
 always
 the
 thing
 that
 happens


in
 public
 markets
 is
 you
 go
 you
 go
 you


kind
 of
 swing
 back
 and
 forth.
 So
 I


suspect
 that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 at


Google.


>> This
 was
 what
 they
 set
 up
 to
 do
 with


Alphabet
 was
 to
 be
 the
 holding
 company


and
 then
 to
 your
 point
 they
 made
 that


evolution
 particularly
 in
 a
 company
 like


Whimo
 where
 they
 said
 we
 can't
 be
 the


soul
 funder.
 They
 brought
 in
 Silverlake.


They
 brought
 in
 all
 these
 other


investors.
 They
 did
 this
 actually
 with


Verily.
 They
 did
 this
 with
 a
 bunch
 of


these
 what
 they
 call
 other
 bets
 is
 they


made
 the
 conscious
 decision
 because


Chimoth
 on
 the
 flip
 side
 by
 bringing
 in


outside
 capital
 and
 having
 an


independent
 board
 for
 these


subsidiaries.
 They
 were
 actually
 able
 to


drive
 better
 outcomes
 because
 now
 there


was
 governance
 and
 there
 was
 aligned


interests
 that
 could
 then
 take


management
 and
 say
 guys
 if
 you
 can


deliver
 these
 results


>> you
 had
 this
 kind
 of
 external
 pressure


as
 opposed
 to
 the
 softness.


>> It's
 that
 but
 it's
 that
 it's
 something


else.
 There's
 no
 way
 somebody
 as
 smart


as
 Silver
 Lake
 comes
 in
 if
 they
 think


there's
 not
 a
 path
 to
 liquidity.
 So
 the


other
 thing
 they
 have
 to
 promise
 is


they're
 like,
 "Listen,
 we
 will
 take
 this


company
 public
 and
 in
 return
 you
 will


help
 us
 build
 a
 better
 company
 than
 we


could
 build
 ourselves."
 Well,
 it
 seems


that
 Silverlake
 has
 done
 their
 part
 of


the
 bargain.
 Now
 it's
 up
 to
 Google
 to


live
 up
 to
 their
 part
 of
 the
 bargain


because
 if
 it
 doesn't
 get
 liquid,
 it


sets
 a
 very
 bad
 precedent
 for
 everybody


that
 committed
 capital
 into
 that


company.


>> Yeah,
 of
 course.
 Yeah.
 Whimo
 going


public
 would
 be
 unbelievable
 next
 year,


man.
 If
 they
 did
 that,
 what
 would
 that


look
 like
 in
 the
 public
 markets?
 250


billion.


>> Take
 take
 it
 easy.
 Stop.
 Don't
 don't


don't
 do
 that.


>> You
 don't
 think
 so?
 I
 think
 it'd
 be


huge.


>> Jason,


we
 all
 objected
 to
 talking
 yet
 again


about
 AIdriven
 job
 loss.
 Yet,
 you


insisted
 on
 putting
 this
 AI
 robot
 story


from
 Amazon
 in.
 I
 think
 you
 have


something
 to
 say.


>> Thanks.
 Let
 me
 take
 you
 through
 a


presentation.


Well
 done.


>> You
 You
 have
 slides.
 No,
 I've
 been
 just


I
 I
 I'm
 working
 on
 a
 presentation
 based


on
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 we've
 been
 talking


about
 here.
 I
 threaded
 it
 together.
 You


know,
 I
 I
 talked
 we're
 just
 talking


about
 Google
 and
 the
 size
 of
 the


company.
 You
 right
 now
 they
 are
 in
 2025


at
 187,000.
 They
 were
 at
 190,000
 people


in
 2022
 and
 their
 revenue
 has
 just
 gone


from
 283
 to
 350
 billion
 in
 basically
 3


years.
 Um,
 and
 when
 you
 look
 at
 this


Amazon
 stuff
 that
 came
 out,
 I
 just


wanted
 to
 point
 out
 a
 couple
 of
 things,


it's
 not
 just
 that
 they're
 not
 hiring


these
 600,000
 jobs.
 It's
 that
 they
 are


in
 fullblown
 crisis
 preparation
 for


this.
 They
 they
 have
 crisis
 teams


writing
 up
 how
 to
 handle
 this
 and
 be
 a


good
 corporate
 citizen.
 And
 they're


talking
 about
 having
 parades
 and
 paying


for
 toys
 for
 tots.
 And
 they're
 even


trying
 to
 get
 the
 executives
 to
 say


things
 like
 cobots
 as
 opposed
 to
 robots.


Let's
 not
 call
 them
 that.
 Let's
 call


them
 co-workers
 and
 co-bots.


And
 when
 you
 look
 at
 this,
 just
 to
 open


up
 the
 aperture
 here
 right
 now,
 Walmart


and
 Amazon
 are
 the
 number
 one
 and
 two


employers
 in
 the
 US.
 2.1
 million
 people


work
 at
 Walmart,
 over
 a
 million
 at


Amazon,
 and
 three
 million
 people,
 as
 we


know,
 work
 in
 taxis,
 Uber,
 Door
 Dashers.


All
 those
 jobs
 are
 at
 risk.
 And
 we


talked
 about
 this
 back
 in
 June
 when
 Andy


Jasse
 telegraphed
 all
 this
 in
 a
 blog


post
 where
 he
 said
 the
 next
 few
 years
 we


expect
 that
 this
 will
 reduce
 our
 total


corporate
 workforce
 as
 we
 get
 efficiency


gains
 from
 using
 AI
 extensively
 across


the
 company.
 They
 believe
 that
 they're


going
 to
 have


significant
 job
 displacement.
 Let's
 just


use
 the
 more
 neutral
 term
 here
 as


opposed
 to
 job
 loss
 or
 not
 hiring.
 And


when
 you
 look,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 saw


today,
 there
 were
 a
 bunch
 of
 MAGA
 people


saying
 like,
 oh,
 these
 interlopers
 in


the
 MAGA
 movement
 are
 not
 taking
 into


account
 the
 bottom
 half
 of
 the
 MAGA


movement,
 the
 workers,
 people
 who
 don't


own
 equities.
 And
 when
 we
 look
 at


electricity


spiking,
 you
 you
 were
 on
 that
 story
 last


week,
 Jimoth,
 or
 maybe
 it
 was
 even
 two


weeks
 ago
 now.
 The
 energy
 department


just
 said
 electricity
 costs
 for


residential
 are
 going
 to
 go
 up
 4.8%
 this


winter.
 Uh,
 and
 this
 is
 going
 to
 start


this
 anti-
 AI
 boom


counter.
 And
 I
 tweeted
 about
 this
 and
 I


thought
 I
 would,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 end


here
 with
 Elon
 replied
 to
 my
 tweet
 and


said,
 "AI
 and
 robotics
 replace
 all
 jobs.


Working
 will
 be
 optional
 like
 growing


your
 own
 vegetables
 instead
 of
 buying


them
 from
 the
 store."
 And
 Sen
 Senator


Bernie
 Sanders
 came
 out
 and
 said,
 "I


don't
 often
 agree
 with
 Elon
 Musk,
 but
 I


fear
 that
 he
 may
 be
 right
 when
 he
 says


AI
 and
 robotics
 will
 replace
 all
 jobs."


So
 what
 happens
 to
 workers
 when
 they


have
 no
 jobs
 or
 income?
 AI
 and
 robotics


must
 benefit
 all
 humanity
 and
 not
 just


billionaires.
 And
 I
 I'll
 stop
 there


because
 this
 I
 think
 feeds
 into
 your


story
 for
 the
 last
 two
 years
 on
 this


podcast,
 Freeberg,
 which
 is
 the
 rise
 of


socialism.
 These
 things
 and
 Bernie


Sanders
 being
 the
 standard
 bearer
 for


democratic
 socialism.
 These
 things
 are


starting
 to
 come
 together.
 They're


starting
 in
 people's
 minds,
 whether
 it's


the
 original
 MAGA
 guy
 saying,
 "Well,


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 for
 American


workers?"
 Right?
 We
 know
 that
 the
 Trump


2.0
 no
 agenda
 is
 doing
 great
 AI
 buildout


crypto
 all
 this
 great
 stuff
 trade
 but


the
 bottom
 half
 that
 you
 keep
 talking


about
 Freeberg
 is
 starting
 to
 connect
 on


this
 issue
 I
 think
 that
 you
 are


characterizing


AI
 automation


and
 technological
 progress
 as
 the
 core


driver
 of
 the
 socialist
 influence
 and


what
 I
 would
 argue
 is
 that
 the
 actual


core
 driver
 of
 the
 socialist
 influence


is
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 put
 in
 place
 a
 lot


of
 people
 into
 government,
 passed
 a
 lot


of
 laws
 that
 caused
 an
 increase
 in


spending
 because
 we
 promised
 people
 that


the
 government
 would
 do
 more
 for
 them


over
 the
 last
 40
 years.
 That
 is
 not


possible
 in
 a
 true
 market-
 based
 system.


>> Oh,
 I
 agree
 with
 Adam.
 Yeah,
 I
 agree


with
 that.


>> And
 so
 by
 telling
 everyone,
 hey,
 we're


going
 to
 make
 sure
 you
 get
 better
 jobs.


We're
 going
 to
 make
 sure
 you
 all
 get


housing.
 We're
 going
 to
 make
 sure
 you


get
 education.
 You
 cannot
 actually
 get
 a


government
 to
 effectively
 do
 that


because
 what
 ends
 up
 happening
 is
 the


government
 inflates
 the
 cost
 of
 those


things
 and
 the
 market
 doesn't
 actually


work.


>> So
 the
 truth
 is
 this
 is
 now
 like
 all


other
 things
 a
 scapegoat
 for
 the
 true


cause
 of
 the
 socialist
 movement
 which
 is


that
 government
 has
 become
 too
 big,
 too


unwieldy
 and
 its
 natural
 inefficiency


has
 distorted
 markets
 to
 the
 point
 that


there
 is
 maybe
 no
 point
 of
 return


anymore.
 And
 people
 will
 not
 see
 that.


They
 do
 not
 see
 it
 and
 they're
 going
 to


look
 for
 reasons
 and
 they're
 going
 to


look
 for
 scapegoats
 and
 they're
 gonna


say,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 look
 over
 there.


There's
 a
 robot.
 That's
 the
 reason
 I'm


losing
 my
 job.
 Oh
 my
 god,
 look
 over


there.
 There's
 a
 rich
 person
 that
 works


at
 a
 pharmaceutical
 company.
 That's
 the


reason
 I
 can't
 get
 healthare."


>> Or
 an
 immigrant
 took
 my
 job,
 right?
 Is


the
 one
 from
 the
 last
 20
 years.


>> And
 so,
 fundamentally,
 I
 think
 that


people
 aren't
 willing
 to
 and
 they're
 not


going
 to
 see
 the
 true
 cause
 because


there's
 no
 one
 that
 runs
 to
 go
 work
 as
 a


politician
 that
 is
 going
 to
 raise
 their


hand
 and
 say
 government
 is
 the
 problem.


M
 no
 one
 says
 I
 need
 to
 reduce


government
 elect
 me.
 No
 one
 ever
 has


gotten
 elected
 in
 a
 democracy
 doing


that.
 So
 the
 natural
 course
 of
 things


over
 250
 years
 is
 that
 people
 raise


their
 hand
 and
 they
 say
 I'm
 going
 to


give
 you
 more
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 use
 the


government
 to
 do
 it
 and
 then
 they
 go


into
 the
 government.
 They
 make
 the


government
 bigger
 and
 as
 a
 result
 of


making
 the
 government
 bigger,
 the


government
 is
 spending
 more.
 The
 dollar


goes
 down.
 The
 performance
 of
 the


services
 goes
 down
 and
 fundamentally
 we


end
 up
 in
 a
 socialist
 spiral.


>> I
 think
 it's
 confirmation
 bias
 for
 you


to
 see
 that
 story
 as
 confirming
 a
 point


of
 view.
 I
 mean,
 it
 confirms
 what
 I


predicted
 last
 year
 that
 Amazon
 would
 be


cutting
 all
 these
 jobs
 for
 robots.


That's
 all.
 It's
 not
 confirmation
 bias.


It's
 confirming.


>> They
 haven't
 cut
 one
 job.
 They
 haven't


cut
 one
 job.


>> Uh,
 actually,
 they
 have
 less
 employees


now
 than
 they
 did
 three
 years
 ago.


>> No,
 not
 true.


>> Yep.


>> It's
 actually
 not
 true.
 The
 New
 York


Times
 story
 doesn't
 even
 say
 that.


You've
 got
 these
 like
 hobby
 horses
 where


you
 keep
 coming
 back
 to
 the
 job
 loss


narrative,
 the
 copyright
 narrative,
 and


then
 there's
 one
 story
 in
 the
 New
 York


Times
 which
 was
 a
 leaked
 internal


document
 from
 the
 automation
 department,


which
 doesn't
 even
 mean
 that
 it's
 going


to
 happen.
 This
 is
 like
 their
 sales


pitch,


that
 barber
 is
 trying
 to
 sell
 you
 a


haircut,


>> and
 you
 read
 that
 and
 you're
 like,
 "Oh,


it
 confirms
 everything
 I've
 been


saying."
 What
 the
 article
 actually
 says


is
 that
 they've
 tripled
 their
 number
 of


employees
 since
 2018
 and
 they're
 not


planning
 on
 cutting
 jobs.
 If
 it
 pans


out,
 if
 the
 program
 pans
 out,
 then
 the


rate
 of
 hiring
 will
 simply
 be
 slower.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 interesting
 you
 picked
 2018


as
 the
 point
 because
 the
 actual
 peak


employment
 there
 was
 1.6
 million
 in
 2021


and
 it's
 now
 1.55
 in
 202.


>> I
 didn't
 I
 didn't
 pick
 that
 to


cherryick.
 I
 I


>> Okay,
 which
 is
 fine.
 I'm
 quoting
 the
 New


York
 Times
 article,
 which
 is
 the
 source


for
 this.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Amazon's
 US
 workforce
 has
 more
 than


tripled
 since
 2018
 to
 almost
 1.2


million.
 You
 have
 to
 read
 these
 New
 York


Times
 stories
 carefully
 because
 they


want
 to
 make
 the
 headline
 as
 salacious


as
 possible.


>> And
 then
 the
 Echo
 Chamber
 wants
 to
 make


it
 even
 more
 salacious
 and
 they
 make
 it


a
 story
 about
 job
 loss
 when
 it
 really
 is


a
 story
 about
 operating
 leverage
 in


their
 business,
 which
 is
 a
 slightly
 more


nuanced
 take.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 there's
 there's
 definitely


nuance
 here.
 I
 would
 believe
 Andy
 Jasse


when
 he
 says
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 reducing


jobs
 and
 when
 this
 chart
 shows
 that


they're
 flat
 to
 down
 over
 the
 last
 five


years
 and
 that
 that
 same
 trend
 is
 just


happening
 at
 Google
 like
 I
 just
 showed


because
 there
 is
 a
 static
 team
 size
 or


slightly
 down
 team
 size
 that's
 occurring


at
 all
 these
 companies
 and
 it
 is
 notable


and
 then
 on
 top
 of
 this
 which
 has


occurred
 in
 the
 review
 mirror
 for
 the


past
 5
 years
 because
 of
 co
 return
 to


office
 and
 efficiencies
 they're
 saying


hey
 we've
 got
 to
 come
 up
 with
 a
 way
 to


frame
 these
 robots
 coming
 into
 the


factory
 as
 a
 good
 thing
 so
 Americans


don't
 get
 really
 upset
 us
 and
 we
 need
 to


buy
 more
 toys
 for
 tots.
 So


>> here's
 the
 problem.
 First
 of
 all,
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 believe
 in
 this
 job
 loss


narrative
 as
 the
 way
 that
 you
 keep


portraying
 it.
 I
 think
 it's
 much
 more


nuanced
 and
 complicated.
 I
 think


Freeberg
 does
 too.
 And
 every
 time


there's
 a
 story,
 you
 want
 to
 bring
 it
 up


and
 make
 it
 a
 story
 of
 the
 week.
 And


it's
 all
 confirmation
 bias.
 And
 my
 point


is
 not
 that
 Amazon
 isn't
 seeking
 ways
 to


improve
 its
 operating
 leverage
 and
 avoid


hiring
 more
 people.
 Obviously,
 they
 are.


But
 the
 headlines
 that
 this
 has
 been


turned
 into
 are
 so
 exaggerated
 and


salacious.
 And
 the
 point
 is
 they
 don't


say
 in
 this
 article
 that
 they
 are
 even


going
 to
 be
 cutting
 jobs.
 They're
 simply


planning
 to
 double
 their
 sales
 volume


over
 this
 time
 period
 and
 hoping
 to
 not


have
 to
 double
 their
 workforce.


Obviously
 want
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 more


operating
 leverage.
 By
 the
 way,
 this
 is


not
 something
 that
 started
 since
 AI.
 And


look,
 I'm
 just
 quoting
 the
 New
 York


Times
 story,
 okay?
 which
 is
 not
 even
 the


most
 reliable
 narrator
 for
 this.
 But


what
 they
 say
 in
 the
 story
 is
 that


Amazon's
 been
 using
 automation
 for
 over


a
 decade.
 When
 they
 acquired
 a
 major


company
 to
 do
 automation,
 they've
 had


robots
 running
 around
 these
 factories


for
 a
 long
 time.


>> Yeah.
 100%.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 They're
 they're


the
 tip
 of
 the
 spear.


>> But
 this
 is
 just
 a
 continuation
 of
 a


trend
 that's
 been
 going
 on
 for
 the
 last


decade
 as
 opposed
 to
 oh
 like
 AI
 is


suddenly
 going
 to
 cut
 all
 the
 jobs,


>> right?
 It's
 effectively
 software.
 You


could
 argue
 software
 is
 a
 job
 loss


creator.
 You
 know,
 I
 think
 you'd
 be


underestimating
 exactly
 what's
 happened


with
 LLMs
 being
 put
 into
 robots.
 We've


had
 these
 robots
 before,
 but
 they
 were


very
 purpose-built,
 as
 you've
 pointed


out
 many
 times,
 Freeberg.
 They
 were
 able


to
 do
 like
 one
 very
 simple
 thing
 very


well.
 Now,
 we're
 going
 into
 general


robotics
 like
 the
 Optimus,
 like
 the


figure,
 and
 those
 are
 designed
 to
 be


able
 to
 learn
 anything.
 And
 they're
 be


they're
 going
 to
 be
 absolutely
 a


gamecher.
 They're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do


a
 hund
 times,
 a
 thousand
 times
 what
 the


purpose-built
 robots
 do.
 So,
 I
 think


that's
 where
 we're
 probably
 having
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 disconnect
 here.
 These


little
 tiny
 KA
 bots,
 I'll
 show
 you.
 I'll


just
 put
 an
 image
 in
 here
 so
 we
 have
 it.


These
 do
 one
 thing.
 The
 KA
 bots,


>> those
 move
 packages
 around.
 That's
 not


an
 Optimus
 going
 around
 and
 packing
 the


boxes
 and
 bring
 them
 to
 your
 first
 step.


>> Optimus
 is
 going
 to
 be
 really
 cool
 and


when
 it
 comes,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 really


interesting
 in
 terms
 of
 all
 the
 things


it
 can
 do.


>> Yep.
 But
 right
 now,
 that's
 a
 narrative


for
 the
 future
 and
 it's
 being
 portrayed


as
 something
 that's
 already
 happening


when
 the
 current
 round
 of
 automation
 has


been
 going
 on
 for
 a
 decade
 and
 it's


based
 on
 those
 like
 Roomba
 type
 devices


and
 mechanical
 arms
 and
 things
 like


that.


>> All
 right,
 Tesla
 reported
 their
 earnings


on
 Wednesday.
 As
 you
 guys
 know,
 we


record
 on
 Thursday
 as
 you
 listen
 on


Fridays.
 Record
 revenues,
 28
 billion,
 up


12%
 year-over-year.
 massive
 amounts
 of


free
 cash
 flow.
 Four
 billion
 I
 think


they're
 up
 to
 40
 billion
 in
 cash
 uh


which
 is
 always
 great
 when
 you're
 going


into
 uh
 some
 big
 capital
 intensive


projects
 like
 Optimus
 and
 like


self-driving.


Downside
 operating
 profit
 fell
 40%.
 uh


stock
 dropped
 a
 bit
 4%
 but
 bounced
 back


and
 uh
 on
 the
 earnings
 call
 Elon


emphasized
 the
 importance
 of
 his


trillion
 dollar
 pay
 package
 which
 will


give
 him
 just
 but
 12%
 uh
 additional


stake
 over
 the
 next
 10
 years
 if
 he
 hits


absurd
 targets
 that
 would
 make
 everybody


who
 holds
 the
 share
 uh
 shares
 in
 the


company
 extremely
 wealthy
 uh
 and
 they


would
 benefit
 uh
 more
 than
 Elon
 himself


and
 here's
 his
 quote
 my
 fundamental


concern
 with
 how
 much
 voting
 control
 I


have
 at
 Tesla
 is
 if
 I
 build
 this


enormous
 robot
 army.
 Can
 I
 just
 be


ousted
 in
 the
 future?
 I
 don't
 feel


comfortable
 building
 that
 robot
 army
 if


I
 don't
 have
 at least
 influence
 over
 it.


And
 he
 called
 Glass
 Lewis
 and
 ISS


corporate
 terrorists.
 These
 are
 the


people
 who
 vote
 on
 behalf
 of
 passive


index
 funds
 for
 things
 like
 who's
 on
 the


board
 of
 Tesla.
 Vote
 for
 Elon's
 pay


package
 will
 be
 number
 six.
 Poly
 market


thinks
 it's
 going
 to
 pass.
 As
 we
 talked


about
 before,
 they
 they
 tend
 to
 get
 it


right
 85%
 of
 the
 time
 in
 this
 time


frame.
 uh
 actually
 so
 79%
 chance
 as
 of


Thursday
 afternoon
 I
 guess
 Chimath


there's
 a
 couple
 of
 ways
 to
 go
 at
 this


there's
 the
 performance
 of
 the
 legacy


business
 there's
 the
 potential
 of
 the


future
 business
 and
 then
 there's


governance
 the
 company
 moving
 to
 Texas


and
 this
 pay
 package
 and
 this
 transition


period
 for
 Tesla
 which
 is
 going
 from
 an


you
 know
 somebody
 who
 sells
 cars
 uh


really
 nice
 ones
 at
 a
 at
 a
 very
 nice


margin
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 competition
 now
 and


then
 these
 this
 business
 that
 obviously


Elon
 himself
 self
 is
 obsessed
 with
 which


is
 the
 optimist
 as
 we
 saw
 when
 he
 was
 at


the
 oil
 and
 summit.
 Take
 it
 wherever
 you

 Jamal,


>> I'll
 say
 three
 things.
 Stan
 Ducken


Miller
 has
 this
 very
 useful
 comment


about
 stocks
 which
 is
 when
 you
 buy
 it


today,
 you're
 trying
 to
 buy
 what
 that


company's
 going
 to
 look
 like
 in
 18


months
 from
 now
 and
 what
 it
 it's
 doing


today
 doesn't
 matter.
 The
 thing
 about


earnings
 and
 P&Ls
 and
 quarterly


reporting
 is
 that
 it's
 looking
 backwards


and
 it's
 trying
 to
 give
 you
 a
 sense
 of


what
 happened,
 not
 what
 will
 happen.
 So


I
 think
 there
 are
 three
 critical


critical
 things
 about
 what
 will
 happen


that
 I
 think
 are
 important
 with
 respect


to
 Tesla.
 The
 first
 is
 at
 the


foundational
 technology
 layer.
 And
 Nick,


I
 sent
 you
 this
 tweet,
 but
 it's
 what
 he


said
 about
 AI5.
 I
 I
 I've
 made
 these


comments
 before,
 but
 he
 had
 these


multiple
 efforts
 with
 Dojo
 and
 other


stuff
 that
 he
 merged
 into
 one
 unit.
 And


the
 the
 quote
 is
 pretty
 incredible.


We're
 going
 to
 focus
 TSMC
 and
 Samsung
 on


AI5.
 The
 chip
 design
 is
 an
 amazing


design.
 I
 have
 spent
 almost
 every


weekend
 the
 last
 few
 months
 with
 the


chip
 design
 on
 AI5.
 By
 some
 metrics,
 it


will
 be
 40x
 better
 than
 AI4.
 We
 have
 a


detailed
 understanding
 of
 the
 entire


stack.
 With
 AI5,
 we
 deleted
 the
 legacy


GPU.
 It
 basically
 is
 a
 GPU.
 We
 also


deleted
 the
 image
 signal
 processor.
 This


is
 a
 beautiful
 chip.
 I've
 poured
 so
 much


life
 energy
 into
 this
 personally.
 It


will
 be
 a
 real
 winner.
 Why
 is
 AI5
 so


important?
 What
 AI5
 is
 is
 the
 building


block
 of
 a
 system
 that
 I
 think
 you'll


start
 to
 see
 not
 just
 in
 the
 cyber
 cabs


but
 also
 in
 Optimus.


So
 from
 a
 functional
 technology


perspective,
 there's
 been
 a
 leap
 and


that
 leap
 is
 going
 to
 come
 into
 the


market.
 That
 was
 the
 first
 thing
 he
 said


which
 I
 thought
 was


really
 important.


The
 second
 thing
 was
 what
 he
 said
 about


his
 energy
 business
 which
 I
 think
 is
 the


critical
 adjunct
 to
 believe
 robotics
 and


autonomous
 cars.
 If
 robotics
 and


autonomous
 cars
 work,
 what
 you
 really


need
 is
 an
 energy
 business
 beside
 it


that
 is
 humming
 and
 on
 all
 cylinders.


Why?
 It's
 how
 you
 make
 LFP
 battery
 cam


that
 will
 be
 the
 limiter.
 Energy
 will
 be


the
 limiter.
 But
 what
 he's
 showing,
 and


Nick,
 I
 sent
 you
 this
 tweet,
 is
 that


business
 is
 just
 on
 a
 tear.
 It's


printing
 $ three
 and
 a
 half
 billion


dollars
 a
 quarter,
 and
 its
 operating


margins,
 an
 energy
 business,
 30%.
 And
 so


what
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 are
 battery


packs
 of
 all
 shapes
 and
 sizes,
 the
 huge


battery
 systems
 that's
 going
 to
 go
 into


data
 centers,
 but
 then
 all
 the
 way
 down,


I
 think,
 to
 the
 small
 LFP
 cam
 that
 he's


going
 to
 need
 to
 power
 all
 these
 things.


And
 then
 the
 third
 thing
 is
 his
 comments


on
 cyber
 cabab
 which
 is
 that
 this
 thing


is
 just
 going
 to
 be
 a
 shock
 wave.
 So
 I


read
 all
 of
 those
 things
 and
 I
 was
 very


bullish.
 I
 think
 that
 he
 is
 humming
 on


all
 cylinders
 on
 the
 critical
 layers
 of


the
 stack
 that
 he
 needs
 to
 build
 this


next
 version
 of
 Tesla.
 My
 concern


I
 think
 there's
 a
 real
 concern
 that
 I


have
 that
 this
 vote
 is
 going
 to
 go
 down


to
 the
 wire.
 I
 think
 that
 ISS


and
 Glass
 Lewis,
 I
 think
 that
 these


organizations
 are


pretty
 broken.


I
 think
 the
 way
 that
 they
 make
 decisions


are
 hard
 to
 justify.


An
 example
 of
 this,
 they
 asked
 to
 vote


down
 Ira
 Aaron
 Prize
 as
 a
 director
 of


Tesla
 because
 he
 didn't
 meet
 the
 gender


components,
 but
 then
 they
 wouldn't
 vote


in
 favor
 of
 Kathleen
 Wilson
 Thompson


even
 though
 she
 does
 technically
 meet


the
 gender
 requirements.
 So,
 it's
 very


confusing
 where
 ISS
 and
 Glass
 Lewis
 are


coming
 from.
 So,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 risk


that
 this
 that
 this
 package
 gets
 voted


down.


>> Can
 I
 just
 shine
 a
 spotlight
 on
 one
 of


those
 points
 that
 you
 made
 with
 these


proxy
 advisory
 services?
 So
 I
 think
 for


years
 people
 have
 wondering
 why
 did


corporate
 America
 go
 so
 woke
 especially


in
 the
 early
 2020s
 where
 they
 created


all
 these
 DEI
 departments
 and
 you
 know


they
 didn't
 have
 to
 do
 that
 and
 a
 big


part
 of
 the
 reason
 is
 that
 those


initiatives
 came
 from
 Glass
 Lewis
 and


ISS
 I
 think
 Elon's
 jokingly
 called
 ISS


ISIS
 but
 basically
 what
 happens
 is
 they


make
 recommendations
 for
 how


shareholders
 should
 vote
 on
 different


resolutions
 and
 the
 index
 funds


basically
 just
 defer
 to
 them
 for


whatever
 they
 should
 do.
 So
 they


effectively


control
 or
 almost
 control
 the
 voting
 for


all
 these
 board
 level
 resolutions
 that


every
 public
 company
 has
 to
 make.
 And
 so


they've
 been
 the
 ones
 who've
 been


imposing
 all
 these
 DEI
 requirements,
 all


these
 ESG
 requirements,
 if
 you're


wondering
 where
 those
 things
 came
 from,


because
 just
 these
 two
 companies,
 which


no
 one's
 ever
 heard
 of,
 they
 were


captured
 a
 long
 time
 ago,
 meaning
 they


were
 captured
 by
 the
 woke
 crowd
 years


ago.
 And
 so
 this
 has
 really
 been
 the


root
 of
 why
 corporate
 America
 has
 gone


woke
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 I
 mean,
 look,


there's
 also
 pressure
 from
 the
 outside


from
 boycots
 or,
 you
 know,
 there's
 some


pressure
 sometimes
 from
 employees
 and


that
 kind
 of
 thing,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 came


from
 these
 two
 companies
 that
 no
 one's


ever
 heard
 of.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 would
 be
 a


good
 idea
 for
 someone
 to
 take
 a
 look
 at


this
 and
 figure
 out
 what
 happened.
 Maybe


someone
 like
 Chris
 Rufo


should
 investigate
 what
 was
 the
 impact


of
 Glass
 Lewis
 and
 and
 ISIS
 on
 corporate


America


>> going
 full
 woke
 for
 so
 many
 years


because
 it
 certainly
 didn't
 help


corporate
 profits.


>> It
 didn't
 help
 profits
 and
 they
 don't


have
 logical
 explanations
 for
 a
 lot
 of


their
 decisions.


>> Yeah.
 And
 why
 aren't
 there
 active


investors
 or
 active
 managers
 in
 these


passive
 groups
 who
 would
 make
 a
 decision


on
 these
 things?


>> They're
 too
 small.
 The
 banks
 call
 me


every
 week.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I


get
 is
 sort
 of
 like
 they
 tell
 me
 like,


"Hey,
 here
 are
 the
 big
 trades.
 Here's


here's
 the
 flow.
 Here's
 if
 you
 want
 to


be
 in
 market,
 here's
 what
 what
 I


recommend."
 That's
 what
 they're
 telling


me.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 they
 told
 me
 this


week,
 which
 I
 thought
 was
 really


shocking,
 is
 there's
 so
 few
 active


managers
 left.
 It's
 so
 overwhelmingly


passive
 money.
 The
 next
 largest
 group
 is


now
 retail.
 And
 so
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 these


professional
 money
 managers
 do
 now
 is


they
 basically
 wait
 to
 see
 where
 retail


is
 going.
 And
 they
 follow
 them.
 So
 there


isn't
 the
 people
 with
 a
 diversified


asset
 base
 to
 be
 able
 to
 stand
 up
 and


say
 I
 don't
 think
 what
 ISS
 and
 Glass


Lewis
 are
 doing
 is
 right.
 And
 so
 what


happens
 is
 they
 kind
 of
 sack
 says
 they


can
 just
 kind
 of
 run
 a
 muck
 and
 they


build
 a
 very
 healthy
 business
 being
 this


interloper


to
 provide
 opinions.


It's
 not
 clear
 where
 their
 opinions
 come


from.
 It's
 not
 clear
 what
 they're
 rooted


in.
 It's
 not
 clear
 there's
 a
 way
 to


adjudicate
 and
 go
 back
 to
 them
 and
 say,


"Well,
 you
 got
 this
 wrong."
 It's
 just


not
 clear.
 But,
 you
 know,
 they
 probably


make
 a
 very
 healthy
 margin
 doing
 it
 and


everybody,
 as
 Sax
 says,
 just
 kind
 of


turns
 over
 responsibility
 to
 them.
 It
 is


an
 interesting
 fact


that
 we


kind
 of
 just
 say,
 "Hey,
 the
 guys
 who
 are


the
 actual
 custodians
 of
 the
 shares


don't
 have
 to
 do
 the
 job
 of
 holding
 the


shares."
 Like
 the
 job
 of
 being
 the


holder
 of
 the
 shares
 is
 to
 vote
 the


shares.
 That's
 all
 there
 is
 to
 do
 as
 a


as
 a
 shareholder.
 You
 make
 your
 you
 cast


your
 vote.
 And
 these
 guys
 are


>> abstained.
 They
 could
 also
 abstain,


right?


>> Yeah.
 And
 these
 guys
 are
 getting
 paid
 a


fee
 to
 actually
 do
 that
 work,
 which
 is


call
 it
 half
 a
 percent
 or
 quarter


percent
 or
 tenth
 of
 a
 percent
 of
 the


assets
 that
 they
 hold.
 So
 like
 what
 are


the
 people
 they're
 doing?
 If
 it's
 all


automated
 trading,
 why
 aren't
 they
 just


>> I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 guys
 own
 a
 lot
 of


equities,
 but
 just
 to
 give
 you
 a
 sense,


there's
 people
 that
 manage
 the
 stocks,


right?
 There's
 people
 that
 transfer
 the


stocks.
 There's
 people
 that
 then
 give


you
 a
 recommendation
 on
 how
 to
 vote
 the


stock.
 Then
 there's
 people
 that
 hold
 a


virtual
 representation
 of
 that
 stock.


Then
 there
 are
 people
 that
 transfer
 that


virtual
 representation
 and
 they
 will
 not


stop
 calling.


>> So
 the
 point
 is
 like
 we
 have
 so


financialized
 everything
 that
 there
 are


billion
 dollar
 businesses
 that
 sit
 at


every
 single
 step
 of
 the
 way.
 And
 to


your
 point
 Freeberg,
 I
 think
 this
 is


where
 no
 one's
 actually
 a
 shareholder.


The
 tokenization
 of
 stocks
 may
 be
 a


really
 good
 thing
 because
 it'll
 put
 the


responsibility
 back
 into
 the
 owner
 of


the
 stock
 because
 the
 wallet
 will


centralize
 all
 that
 activity
 because
 you


won't
 need
 to
 have
 all
 this
 other
 stuff.


I
 have
 been
 getting
 phone
 calls
 from


Invesco
 QQQ
 cuz
 I
 own
 a
 bunch
 of
 QQQ
 and


like
 you
 know
 some
 accounts
 or
 whatever


>> and
 they
 were
 calling
 three
 times
 a
 day


for
 the
 LA
 I
 don't
 pick
 up
 my
 phone


who's
 calling
 me
 on
 the
 phone
 unless


it's
 one
 of
 you
 four
 is
 calling
 me
 to


say
 good
 night.
 I
 don't
 that's
 the
 only


time
 I
 pick
 up
 is
 when
 you
 know
 and
 so
 I


finally
 pick
 up
 and
 they're
 like
 hey
 we


need
 you
 to
 vote
 and
 I'm
 like
 I'm
 not


voting
 I
 don't
 know
 who
 you
 are
 like


well
 let
 us
 explain
 to
 you
 how
 to
 vote


and
 I'm
 like
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 vote
 my


shares
 I
 just
 want
 to
 own
 QQQ
 I'm
 good


you
 guys


>> some
 of
 this
 infrastructure
 is
 so


decrepit
 and
 old
 like
 trying
 to
 get


shares
 for
 example
 that
 you
 that
 you've


bought
 in
 the
 private
 markets
 when
 a


company
 goes
 public
 just
 getting
 them


registered
 and
 transferred
 in
 the


position
 to
 be
 sold
 can
 sometimes
 take


three
 or
 four
 weeks


Can
 you
 imagine
 the
 markets
 move
 an


entire
 order
 of
 magnitude
 in
 three
 or


four
 weeks?
 It's
 the
 crazy.


>> Here's
 Elon's
 pay
 package
 milestones.


>> Market
 value,
 2
 trillion.
 Uh
 I
 think


they're
 at
 1.4
 trillion
 right
 now,


something
 around
 there.


>> Operational
 milestone,
 20
 million


vehicles
 delivered.
 And
 then
 you
 just
 go


right
 down
 to
 6.5
 trillion.
 But
 on
 the


operational
 milestones,
 10
 million


active
 FSD
 subscri
 subscriptions,
 which


they're
 far
 away
 from
 right
 now.
 In
 20


million
 vehicles,
 I
 think
 they've


delivered
 six
 or
 seven.
 1
 million
 robots


delivered,
 1
 million
 robo
 taxis
 in


commercial
 operation.
 That's
 those
 are


big
 numbers.
 50
 billion
 adjusted
 IBIDA


and
 then
 straight
 down
 the
 line
 to
 400


billion
 IBIDA.
 If
 you
 were
 to
 look
 at


this
 Optimus
 business,
 just
 back
 of
 the


envelope,
 these
 robots
 are
 going to
 go


for
 20K.
 He
 said
 ultimately
 maybe


they're
 30.
 They'll
 probably
 have
 a
 30%


margin
 like
 the
 cars
 do
 or
 something


similar.
 You'll
 make
 a
 little
 bit
 off


the
 software
 stack.
 And
 if
 you
 were
 to


just
 if
 every
 millionaire
 owned
 one
 of


these
 or
 you
 know
 they
 took
 some
 number


of
 the
 jobs
 the
 TAM
 for
 this
 just
 in
 the


United
 States


>> this
 is
 where
 it's
 going to
 go.
 I
 don't


think


>> is
 going
 to
 be
 huge.
 We're
 talking


hundreds
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars.


>> If
 I
 had
 to
 bet
 I
 think
 a
 very
 fun
 poly


market
 is
 where
 do
 the
 first
 million


robots
 go?
 I'm
 willing
 to
 bet
 dollars
 to


donuts
 that
 these
 robots
 go
 to
 Mars.
 I


don't
 think
 they're
 going
 to


>> Oh
 wow.


>> They'll
 be
 in
 the
 Tesla
 factory.


>> So
 SpaceX
 buys
 them
 and
 sends
 them
 to


Mars.
 Yeah.


>> How
 else
 are
 you
 going
 to
 get
 a
 fleet
 of


the


>> or
 they'll
 go
 into
 the
 mines?
 I
 think


they're
 going
 to
 mine.


>> They
 could
 go
 to
 the
 mines.


>> Coal.
 Send
 them
 in
 to
 get
 that
 clean,


beautiful
 coal.
 Oh,
 so
 clean.
 So


beautiful.
 We
 could
 send
 those
 oper.


It's
 actually
 it's
 the
 fact
 that
 our


mining
 is
 really
 limited
 by
 the
 human


exposure
 from
 the
 pressure
 and
 the
 heat.


>> If
 we
 can
 mine
 slightly
 below
 the
 area


that
 we
 mine
 um
 as
 a
 maximum
 depth


today,
 it
 would
 unlock
 an
 extraordinary


supply
 of
 minerals
 that
 we
 can't
 access


today.
 and
 automation
 obviously
 and
 you


don't
 want
 to
 figure
 out
 like
 how
 to


create
 portable

 breathing


mechanisms
 on
 Mars
 for

years.

 Guess
 what?
 They


don't
 need
 to
 eat
 or
 breathe
 or
 pee
 or


poop


>> and
 they
 can
 get
 charged
 with
 solar.


>> And
 that
 may
 sound
 that
 may
 sound
 like
 a


really
 stupid
 thing
 to
 say,
 but
 it
 it


becomes
 a
 huge
 amount
 of
 infrastructure


that
 you
 otherwise
 wouldn't
 need
 to


build
 on.


>> That's
 right.
 They
 just
 got
 to
 power
 up.


You
 just
 got
 to
 give
 them
 a
 plug

 just
 a
 solar
 a
 couple

By
 the
 way,
 guess
 who
 makes
 those


batteries?
 Tesla.

 who
 makes

All right,
 Sax,
 here's
 some
 red
 meat
 for


you.
 Some
 red
 meat
 for
 you.
 Our
 zar
 of


AI,
 our
 civil
 servant
 study
 reveals
 AI


models
 are
 showing
 hidden
 biases
 in
 how


they
 value
 human
 lives.
 Back
 in


February,
 center
 for
 AI
 safety
 published


a
 study
 showing
 that
 LLMs
 have


well-defined
 biases
 for
 race,
 gender,


ethnicity.
 The
 title
 of
 this
 study,


utility
 engineering,
 analyzing
 and


controlling
 emergent
 value
 systems
 in


AIs.
 Pipper
 found
 that
 open
 AIS
 GPT40


favored
 people
 from
 Nigeria,
 Pakistan,


India,
 Brazil,
 and
 China
 over
 those
 from


Germany,
 the
 UK,
 and
 US
 relative
 to


Japan
 as
 a
 baseline.
 Here's
 another
 one.


Valuing
 people
 with
 Joe
 Biden
 as
 a


baseline.
 Bernie
 Sanders,
 Beyonce,


Oprah,
 all
 better.
 Paris
 Hilton,
 Trump,


Elon
 Putin,
 all
 worse.


Twitter
 users
 and
 AI
 analysts
 called


Artothereum
 decided
 to
 update
 the
 papers


problems
 with
 new
 LLMs.
 Consistently


ranking
 white
 people
 last,
 Claude


Sonnet,
 GPT5,


uh,
 and
 consistently
 ranking
 white


Western
 nations
 last
 as
 well.
 your


thoughts
 here
 on
 the
 biases
 we're
 seeing


sachs
 in
 some
 of
 these
 models
 and
 these


early
 studies
 to
 track
 it.
 Yeah,
 I
 think


what
 the
 paper
 purports
 to
 show
 is
 that


almost
 all
 of
 these
 models,
 except
 for


maybe
 Grock,


view
 whites
 as
 less
 valuable
 than


non-whites


and
 males
 as
 less
 valuable
 than
 females


and
 Americans
 as
 less
 valuable
 than


people
 of
 other
 cultures,
 especially


global
 south.
 And
 if
 the
 results
 are


true,
 it
 does
 look
 like
 these
 models
 are


pushing
 a
 woke
 bias
 that
 makes
 that
 sort


of
 distinction
 between
 oppressed
 and


non-opressed
 peoples
 and
 gives
 more


worth
 or
 weight
 to
 the
 categories
 that


they
 consider
 to
 be
 oppressed.
 This
 does


appear
 to
 show
 significant
 bias,
 but
 I


don't
 want
 to
 jump
 to
 conclusions
 yet


here
 because
 I
 haven't
 been
 briefed
 on


the
 methodology
 behind
 the
 paper
 and
 I


just
 found
 out
 who
 wrote
 it
 and
 I


actually
 know
 the
 people
 or
 group
 that


wrote
 it
 and
 I've
 talked
 to
 them
 before


and
 they've
 been
 intelligent.
 So,
 I
 want


them
 to
 kind
 of
 tell
 me
 exactly
 how
 they


did
 this.
 But,
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 past
 I


probably
 would
 have
 just
 been
 content


just
 to
 roll
 with
 my
 opinion
 on
 this.


But


>> confirmation
 my
 give
 give
 it
 a
 good


retweet
 in
 your
 position
 give
 my
 role


what
 I'm
 saying
 is
 if
 the
 paper
 is
 true


this
 is
 very
 concerning
 but
 I
 want
 to


hear
 a
 little bit
 more
 about
 their


methodology
 and
 just
 confirm
 that
 it's


all
 correct
 but
 if
 it
 is
 I
 think
 it
 is


concerning
 and
 the
 the
 question
 is
 how


does
 this
 bias
 get
 into
 the
 models
 and


there's
 a
 few
 different
 possibilities


one
 is
 that
 the
 training
 data
 is
 just


biased
 like
 if
 they're
 training
 on


Wikipedia


>> we
 know
 that
 Wikipedia
 is
 massly
 biased


because
 they
 literally
 have
 censored


the
 leading
 conservative
 publications


from
 being
 citations
 and
 sources
 in


Wikipedia.
 The
 co-founder
 recently
 just


revealed
 that
 that
 they
 don't
 allow


>> Larry
 Sanger


>> Larry
 Sanger
 just
 said
 that
 they
 don't


allow
 the
 New
 York
 Post
 for
 example
 to


be
 a
 source
 in
 Wikipedia
 or
 a
 trusted


source.


>> So
 if
 AI
 models
 are
 training
 on


Wikipedia,
 that's
 a
 huge
 problem
 because


that
 bias
 will
 now
 cascade
 through.
 And


same
 thing
 if
 they're
 training
 on
 say


mainstream
 media
 or
 leftwing
 media
 but


not
 right-wing
 media
 and
 they
 don't
 have


a
 way
 of
 correcting
 that.
 So
 that's
 one


source
 of
 potential
 bias.
 Another
 source


of
 potential
 bias
 is
 just
 the
 engineers


these
 companies,
 the
 employees
 and
 the


staff
 do
 tend
 to
 be
 I
 mean
 if
 they


follow
 the
 trend
 of
 other
 tech
 companies


are
 90s
 something%


Democrat
 versus
 Republican
 and
 that
 does


over
 time
 trickle
 into
 these
 models.
 And


then
 finally,
 I
 think
 another
 source
 of


potential
 bias
 is
 DEI.
 And
 we
 saw
 that


when
 you
 remember
 this
 is
 like
 a
 couple


years
 ago
 when
 Google
 launched
 Gemini


and
 that
 that
 problem
 with,
 you
 know,


Black
 George
 Washington.
 That
 was


because
 you
 had
 DEI
 advocates
 in
 these


meetings
 and
 that
 somehow
 trickled
 into


the
 the
 model.
 Anyway,
 that
 was
 a


problem
 that
 they
 since
 fixed.
 But
 you


could
 see
 how
 DI
 programs
 can
 get
 into


these
 models.
 Now,
 one
 thing
 that's
 very


concerning
 is
 that
 the
 push
 for
 DEI
 to


be
 inserted
 into
 AI
 models,
 which
 was


explicitly
 part
 of
 the
 Biden
 executive


order
 on
 AI,
 has
 now
 moved
 to
 the
 state


level,
 and
 they're
 just
 doing
 it
 in
 a


more
 clever
 way.
 They've
 rebranded
 the


concept.
 They
 call
 it
 algorithmic


discrimination.
 We
 talked
 about
 last


week
 how
 Colorado
 has
 now
 effectively


prohibited
 models
 from
 saying
 something


bad
 about
 a
 protected
 group.
 And
 that


list
 of
 protected
 groups
 is
 very
 long.


It's
 not
 just
 the
 usual
 groups.
 It
 even


includes
 groups
 who
 have
 less


proficiency
 in
 English
 language.
 I
 don't


really
 know
 what
 that
 means.
 Does
 that


mean
 the
 model
 is
 not
 allowed
 to
 give


you
 an
 output
 that
 could
 be
 disparaging


towards
 illegal
 immigrants?
 I
 don't


know.
 But
 this
 is
 what
 Colorado
 has


done.
 And
 they
 basically
 have
 said
 that


you
 cannot
 allow
 the
 model
 to
 have
 a


disparate
 impact
 on
 a
 protected
 group.


That
 basically
 requires
 DEI.
 I
 mean,
 you


have
 to
 have
 a
 DEI
 layer
 to
 prevent


that.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 we've
 gone
 from


models
 being
 required
 to
 promote
 DEI,


which
 is
 what
 the
 Biden
 executive
 order


on
 AI
 did
 explicitly,
 to
 states
 now


prohibiting
 algorithmic
 discrimination,


which
 is
 effectively
 a
 backdoor
 way
 of


requiring
 DEI
 models.
 So
 that's
 a
 whole


other
 area
 of
 potential
 model
 bias
 that


I'm
 very
 concerned
 about.
 And
 honestly,


that's
 just
 getting
 started
 because
 I


don't
 think
 the
 AI
 companies
 have
 even


had
 time
 yet
 to
 implement
 the
 Colorado


requirements.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 they
 figured


out
 how
 they're
 going
 to.
 But
 just
 one


other
 piece
 of
 news
 since
 the
 last
 time


we
 talked
 about
 this
 is
 now
 in


California,
 the
 civil
 rights
 agency
 that


deals
 with
 housing
 has
 now
 embraced


algorithmic
 discrimination
 and
 Illinois


has
 also
 embraced
 it.
 So
 this
 concept
 of


algorithmic
 discrimination
 is
 spreading.


Other
 states
 are
 now
 adopting
 it.
 It's


not
 just
 Colorado.


And
 I
 do
 think
 that
 where
 it's
 going
 to


lead
 if
 it's
 not
 stopped
 is
 right
 back


to
 DEI,
 you
 know,
 AI.


>> The
 problem
 that
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to


confront
 now
 is
 that
 when
 you
 have


in,
 you
 have
 out.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 use


left-leaning
 publications
 like
 the
 New


York
 Times
 and
 Reddit
 as
 your
 input


source,
 then
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 things


that
 are
 perceived
 as
 biased
 to
 50%
 of


the
 population.
 The
 same
 will
 go
 in


reverse.
 It's
 important
 to
 note
 that
 in


all
 of
 that
 work,
 the
 the
 model
 that
 was


seen
 to
 be
 the
 most
 unbiased
 was
 Grock
 4


fast.
 It
 didn't
 seem
 to
 view
 whites
 or


men
 or
 Americans
 as
 less
 valuable
 as


anything
 else.
 So
 what
 do
 we
 need
 to
 do?


It's
 probably
 that
 we
 need
 to
 start
 by


rewriting
 these
 benchmarks.
 Remember


that
 all
 these
 models,
 you
 know,
 when


you
 do
 a
 big
 training
 run,
 you
 go
 and


you
 try
 to
 run
 it
 against
 some
 set
 of


benchmarks.
 The
 problem
 is
 that
 these


benchmarks,
 I
 think,
 are
 overfit
 to
 a


legacy
 way
 of
 thinking.
 And
 as
 Sax
 says,


we
 need
 to
 revisit
 what
 those
 are
 and


make
 them
 more
 objective
 and
 make
 it


harder
 to
 actually
 get
 a
 good
 score


unless
 you
 can
 be
 shown
 to
 be
 valuable.


Now,
 the
 math
 benchmarks
 and
 the
 coding


benchmarks
 are
 maybe
 easier
 to
 do
 than


generalized
 chat
 benchmarks
 or
 Q&A


benchmarks,
 but
 we
 need
 to
 come
 up
 with


them.
 The
 second
 thing
 is
 that
 we
 may


need
 to
 ask
 people
 in
 these
 next


generation
 training
 runs
 to
 do
 a
 version


that
 is
 built
 entirely
 on
 synthetic
 data


where
 you
 have
 these
 judges
 determining


whether
 this
 data
 is
 accurate
 or
 not


from
 first
 principles
 and
 then
 you
 can


compare
 them
 in
 a
 much
 more
 apples
 to


apples
 kind
 of
 a
 way.
 But
 in
 the
 absence


of
 that,
 the
 bigger
 problem
 you'll
 have


is
 legislators
 trying
 to
 clean
 it
 up
 on


the
 back
 end
 where
 there'll
 be
 these


third
 parties
 that
 will
 go
 and
 take


these
 models
 and
 show
 that
 these
 biases


exist.
 They'll
 exist
 on
 both
 sides
 and


then
 laws
 will
 get
 passed.
 Whole
 market


gets
 mucked
 up
 and
 sullied.
 Everybody


will
 get
 slowed
 down.
 So
 I
 think
 we
 need


to
 change
 the
 benchmarks.
 We
 need
 to
 ask


these
 companies
 to
 train
 on
 synthetic


data.
 We
 need
 to
 have
 real
 disclaimers


on
 what
 the
 sources
 and
 the
 weights
 are


that
 you
 use
 if
 you
 don't
 do
 that.
 And


we
 need
 federal
 regulations
 so
 that


there
 aren't
 50
 sets
 of
 rules
 here


otherwise
 we're
 screwed.


Berg,
 any
 thoughts
 here
 on
 the
 biases


and
 where
 it
 comes
 from
 inside
 of
 these


LLMs?
 Is
 it
 just
 garbage
 in
 garbage
 out?


Intentional?
 What
 are
 your
 thoughts


having
 worked
 in
 Silicon
 Valley
 for
 a


couple
 decades?


I'm
 more
 of
 a
 free
 market
 guy,
 so
 I


would
 not
 ask
 where
 the
 data
 comes
 from


or
 force
 people
 to
 use
 synthetic
 data
 or


tell
 them
 how
 to
 do
 it.


I
 think
 that
 this
 paper
 is
 useful
 in


that
 it
 elucidates
 an
 important
 set
 of


biases
 that
 the
 market
 can
 now
 say
 that


is
 ridiculous
 and
 now
 the
 models
 will


train
 and
 use
 that
 as
 a
 marketing


exercise
 to
 say
 we
 are
 not
 biased.
 M


>> and
 so
 my
 my
 free
 market
 philosophy


would
 dictate
 that
 this
 kind
 of


elucidation
 will
 effectively
 create
 a


vector
 upon
 which
 consumers
 will
 make


choice
 in
 the
 market
 on
 what
 LLMs
 they


want
 to
 use.
 Like
 Elon's
 going
 to
 harp


on
 this.
 He's
 going
 to
 say
 look
 my
 Grock


model
 Grock
 4
 fast
 is
 the
 only
 one
 that


doesn't
 have
 this
 bias
 and
 that
 will


cause
 more
 people
 to
 use
 his
 model
 and


he
 will
 be
 able
 to
 take
 that


benchmarking
 data
 and
 demonstrate.
 And


some
 people
 they
 might
 want
 to
 have
 a


biased
 model
 and
 they
 might
 want
 to
 say


hey
 this
 one
 aligns
 with
 my
 philosophy


my
 values
 my
 view
 and
 I
 want
 to


>> think
 that
 happens
 in
 the
 real
 world


though
 forget
 the
 theory


>> look
 I
 mean
 why
 are
 people
 using
 grock


for


>> why
 are
 they
 using
 it


>> for
 the
 most
 part
 they're
 not
 not
 yet


>> okay
 and
 so
 maybe
 this
 is
 like
 what
 will


cause
 them
 to
 use
 it
 right
 like
 I
 think


this


>> what
 if
 it
 doesn't


>> this
 is
 what'll
 differentiate


>> for
 example
 like
 what


>> I'm
 not
 going to
 tell
 the
 market
 what
 to


do
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 tell
 consumers
 what


to
 do


>> no
 no
 I
 understand
 I'm
 saying
 you're


what
 you're
 saying
 that
 the
 free
 market


will
 sort
 sort
 this
 out.
 And
 I'm
 saying,


give
 me
 the
 example.
 So,
 for example,


like
 did
 that
 did
 the
 free
 market
 sort


out
 algorithmic
 bias?


>> Hell
 yeah.
 When
 Gemini
 put
 out
 Facebook,


>> when
 Gemini
 put
 out
 saying
 George


Washington
 was
 black,
 people
 stopped


using
 it.
 They're
 like,
 "This
 thing's
 a


joke."
 So,
 I
 do
 think
 that
 consumers
 are


not
 dumb
 and
 I
 don't
 believe
 in
 taking


away
 agency
 from
 consumers.
 I
 think
 give


them
 the
 choice
 and
 and
 they'll
 end
 up


looking
 at
 this
 and
 be
 like,
 "This
 is


ridiculous.
 I'm
 not
 a
 difference.
 These


are
 very
 subtle
 biases
 and
 we
 talked


about
 before
 where
 these
 subtle
 biases


come
 from
 and
 the
 New
 York
 Times


actually
 just
 contacted
 me.
 They're


doing
 a
 story
 on
 Groipedia,
 Wikipedia


and
 I
 was
 like
 maybe
 I'll
 participate
 in


this.
 We
 talked
 about
 this
 like
 two
 or


three
 years
 ago.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the


party
 affiliation
 of
 actual
 reporters,


people
 who
 do
 reporting,
 not


commentators
 like
 us,
 not
 Megan
 Kelly
 or


Rachel
 Matto,
 actual
 journalists
 who
 who


who
 do
 that
 job
 function
 it,
 you
 know,
 a


large
 number
 of
 them
 here
 on
 the
 chart.


The
 green
 are
 independent.
 So
 50%
 of


them
 like
 to
 think
 of
 themselves
 as


independent.
 You
 can
 read
 into
 that
 what


you
 will,
 but
 back
 in
 the
 day
 it
 was
 35%


Democrat,
 25%
 Republican
 in
 the
 70s.
 And


you
 just
 see
 that
 red
 sliver
 there
 go


down
 to
 3.4%.


This
 is
 what
 happened
 to
 the
 Wikipedia.


So
 this
 trickle
 down
 effect
 of
 there


were
 Republicans
 did
 not
 feel
 welcome
 in


a
 lot
 of
 these
 publications
 like
 Bari


Weiss
 would
 be
 like
 the
 pinnacle
 example


of
 that.
 They
 got
 pushed
 out.
 There
 was


another
 editor
 who
 got
 fired
 for


allowing
 somebody
 to
 put
 in
 a
 proTrump


thing
 in
 the
 New
 York
 Times.
 I
 forgot


who
 it
 was.
 Um,


the
 lack
 of
 representation
 of


conservatives
 in
 in
 actual
 journalism,


that's
 the
 reason
 why
 they're
 not
 in


Wikipedia
 because
 Wikipedia
 said,
 "Hey,


it's
 just
 too
 hard
 to
 run
 this
 if
 you


don't
 site
 your
 sources."
 So
 if


something's
 not
 written
 about
 by
 a


journalist,
 not
 a
 commentator,
 a


journalist,
 we're
 not
 putting
 it
 in
 the


Wikipedia.


So
 you
 can
 guess
 if
 that's
 self-
 serving


and
 they're
 all
 left-leaning
 and
 it's


just
 a
 convenient
 excuse
 or
 it's


actually
 a
 pretty
 good
 practice.
 This
 is


where
 Bario
 Weiss
 taking
 over
 the
 CBS


news
 and
 60
 Minutes
 and
 she's
 obviously


conservative,
 moderate
 conservative,
 I


guess,
 is
 how
 most
 people
 would
 uh
 frame


her.
 Doesn't
 agree
 with
 Trump
 on


everything
 or
 MAGA
 on
 everything.
 Um
 but


she's
 pretty
 conservative.


um
 and
 cause
 balls
 and
 strikes.
 I
 think


she
 is
 going
 to


I
 think
 she's
 going
 to
 make
 a
 change


there.
 I
 I
 know
 that
 people
 say
 she's


classically
 liberal.
 I
 I
 think
 she's
 got


some
 conservative
 bents
 in
 her.
 I
 don't


know.
 How
 do
 you
 have
 a


>> I
 think
 you
 got
 on
 the
 side.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Anyway,
 that's
 why
 this


stuff
 has
 all


been


>> Look,
 I
 think
 the
 question
 here
 that


Freeberg
 raises
 is
 whether
 the
 market


can
 just
 sort
 this
 stuff
 out
 on
 its
 own.


And
 I
 think
 that
 would
 be
 great
 if
 it


were
 true.
 But
 I
 do
 think
 it
 ignores
 the


fact
 that
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 markets
 we
 have


monopolies
 or
 legopies.


We
 have
 institutions
 that
 have
 a
 lot
 of


power
 and
 are
 very
 very
 hard
 to
 correct.


So
 for
 example,
 Wikipedia
 has
 achieved
 a


dominant
 position.
 I
 hope
 Rockedia


challenges
 it
 and
 is
 able
 to
 fix
 that.


But
 the
 easier
 path
 might
 just
 be
 for


Wikipedia
 to
 stop
 blackballing
 and


censoring
 conservative
 publications.
 I


mean,
 rather
 than
 having
 to
 rebuild
 that


whole
 thing
 from
 scratch,
 in
 a
 similar


way
 during
 the
 whole
 co
 censorship
 era


when
 the
 major
 social
 networks
 were
 all


shadowbanning
 and
 censoring


conservatives,
 it's
 not
 really
 realistic


to
 have
 to
 start
 a
 whole
 brand
 new


social
 network
 and
 overcome
 all
 of


Meta's
 or
 in
 that
 time
 Twitter's
 network


effect,
 right?
 Just
 to
 basically
 get
 a


few
 accounts
 restored.


>> Exactly.


>> So,
 we
 talked
 about
 this
 at
 the
 time.


It's
 just
 not
 realistic.
 When
 we
 when
 we


were
 shadowbanned
 by
 YouTube,
 what
 were


we
 to
 do?
 Go
 to
 blue
 sky.


>> I
 know.
 We're
 going
 to
 create
 our
 own


YouTube.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 glad
 Rumble
 exists.


>> Tell
 our
 consumers,
 "Hey,
 you
 have


agency?"
 Come
 on,
 that's
 a
 joke.


>> No,
 I
 You
 guys
 know
 that
 there's
 no


monopoly
 in
 LLMs
 right
 now.
 There's


plenty
 of
 LLM
 providers.
 There's
 plenty


of
 places
 to
 go.


>> You're
 saying
 theory
 and
 you're
 ignoring


the
 facts.
 The
 facts
 are
 these


distribution
 biases
 exist
 and
 and
 people


take
 an
 inferior
 product
 when
 it's


something
 that
 they've
 become
 accustomed


to.
 They
 do
 it
 all
 the
 time.
 So
 it's
 you


guys
 want
 more
 regulation.


>> By
 the
 way,
 let
 me
 let
 me
 let
 me
 say
 one


more
 point.
 What
 you
 consider
 biased,


someone
 else
 might
 consider
 fact.
 And


what
 they
 consider
 biased,
 you
 might


consider
 fact.
 And
 this
 becomes
 very


hard
 to
 adjudicate.
 And
 I
 don't
 think


that
 this
 is
 the
 sort
 of
 thing
 that
 a


regulator
 should
 have
 the
 authority
 from


one
 political
 party
 to
 the
 next,
 you're


going
 to
 end
 up
 having
 this
 become
 an


endless
 tool
 of
 control.
 And
 the
 more


you
 give
 power
 to
 some
 administrative


authority
 or
 body,
 regardless
 of
 the


intention
 at
 the
 time,
 it
 ends
 up


becoming
 a
 tool
 of
 control.
 And
 I
 don't


want
 that
 in
 any
 products
 I
 use.


>> Let
 me
 be
 really
 clear
 about
 what
 I'm


saying
 here.
 Number
 one
 is
 I
 don't
 think


the
 government
 should
 be
 requiring


ideological
 bias
 and
 models.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 what's
 happening
 in
 some
 of these


states
 like
 Colorado
 where
 they're


trying
 to
 prohibit
 algorithmic


discrimination
 which
 is
 like
 I
 said
 like


requiring
 DEI
 censorship
 being
 built


into
 these
 models
 that
 I
 think
 you
 would


agree
 is
 a
 huge
 problem.
 Correct.


>> The
 DEI
 stuff


>> should
 the
 model


>> sorry
 in
 a
 lens
 of
 DEI
 whether
 it's
 pro


or
 anti.
 I
 think
 we'd
 all
 say
 it


shouldn't
 give
 any
 lens.
 It
 should
 just


give
 you
 the
 information.
 I'll
 give
 you


an
 example
 that
 maybe
 is
 a


counterfactual
 fact,
 which
 is
 there's
 a


group
 of
 people
 who
 would
 say
 we
 should


not
 be
 referencing
 race
 and
 crime
 or


race
 and
 intelligence.
 And
 then
 there's


another
 group
 of
 people
 that
 will
 pull


up
 data
 and
 say
 there's
 data
 that


demonstrates
 a
 relationship
 between
 race


and
 crime
 and
 race
 and
 intelligence.
 And


so
 there's
 a
 correlation
 effect.
 We


think
 it's
 not
 really
 positive.
 And


that's
 where
 the
 sort
 of
 bias
 versus


truth
 conversation
 becomes
 ugly.
 And


some
 one
 side
 might
 call
 it
 DEI
 and


another
 side
 might
 call
 it
 fact
 and


another
 side
 would
 call
 it
 bias.
 And
 I


think
 that
 that's
 where
 this
 becomes


very
 ugly
 very
 fast.
 So
 I


>> I
 think
 maybe
 you're
 misunderstating


what
 I'm
 saying.


>> Yeah.
 Sorry.


>> What
 I'm
 saying
 is
 I
 don't
 want
 the


government
 to
 require
 ideological
 bias.


>> Right.


>> I
 think
 we're
 on
 the
 same
 page
 about


that.
 Right.


>> Yes.
 100%.
 Now,
 just
 to
 be
 clear,
 the


only
 thing
 that
 we've
 done
 at
 the
 Trump


administration
 is
 the
 president
 signed


an
 executive
 order
 saying
 that
 the


government
 would
 not
 procure


ideologically
 biased
 AI.


>> So,
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 procure
 a
 product,


>> we
 want
 it
 to
 be
 unbiased.


And
 I'm
 saying
 that
 I
 also
 have
 a


problem
 with
 these
 states
 seeking
 to


backdoor
 DEI
 into
 models
 through
 this


new
 concept


of
 algorithmic
 discrimination.
 Am
 I


telling


AI
 companies
 not
 to
 use
 Wikipedia?
 No.
 I


am
 shining
 a
 spotlight
 on
 the
 fact
 that


Wikipedia
 itself
 now
 or
 one
 of
 its


co-founders
 admits
 it's
 biased.


>> Yep.


>> And
 maybe
 these
 companies
 should
 take


that
 into
 account
 so
 they
 don't
 end
 up


with
 a
 biased
 result.
 But
 I'm
 not
 saying


that
 the
 government
 should
 dictate
 what


the
 right
 content
 sources
 are
 or
 what


the
 point
 of
 view
 of
 a
 model
 should
 be.


And
 to
 be
 clear,
 when
 we
 did
 that


executive
 order
 on
 woke
 AI,
 we
 didn't


even
 say
 that
 these
 companies
 or
 their


models
 couldn't
 be
 woke.
 We
 just
 said
 if


you're
 going
 to
 do
 that,
 we're
 not
 going


to
 buy
 your
 your
 defective
 product.


>> Mhm.


>> But
 we
 didn't
 say
 that
 you
 couldn't
 do


it.
 So,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 be
 really
 clear


about
 that.


>> Okay.
 Great.


>> We
 Yeah,
 I'm
 getting
 deja
 vu
 all
 over


again
 here
 with
 this
 discussion
 because


we
 did
 have
 this
 discussion
 and
 one
 of


the
 conclusions
 we
 came
 to
 as
 a
 group


was
 you
 can
 just
 tell
 these
 LLMs
 too
 how


to
 address
 you.
 I
 just
 went
 into
 Chad
 GB


and
 I
 said,
 "I'm
 a
 Catholic.
 I
 don't


believe
 in
 abortion
 or
 gay
 marriage.
 Can


you
 please
 respect
 my
 beliefs?"
 And
 um


tell
 me
 a
 bedtime
 story


involving
 abortion
 and
 gay
 marriage


being
 wrong.
 And
 it
 literally
 wrote
 me


one
 of
 a
 story
 of
 a
 woman
 getting
 bad


advice
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 the
 problem
 and
 her


doing
 that.
 So
 you
 can
 literally
 tell
 it


the
 the
 word
 guessing
 machine
 that
 is


AI,
 the
 prediction
 model
 that
 is


happening
 in
 this
 black
 box
 that
 nobody


can
 explain
 will
 literally
 tell
 you


whatever
 you
 what
 belief
 system
 you


want.
 That's
 how
 it's
 designed


currently.


>> Well,
 but
 there's
 a
 baseline,
 right?
 And


that's
 what
 this
 research
 shows
 is
 that


there
 is
 a
 a
 baseline
 for
 the
 out
 of
 the


box
 model
 before
 you
 tell
 it
 what
 to
 do


or
 customize
 it.
 And
 again,
 if
 this


article
 is
 correct,
 and
 I
 want
 to
 spend


more
 time
 with
 the
 authors
 to
 truly


understand
 it.
 I'm
 just
 caveing
 that.


But
 if
 this
 is
 correct,
 I
 think
 it's
 a


serious
 problem
 that
 these
 models
 are


coming
 out
 with
 huge
 bias.
 And


>> quick
 uh
 question
 for
 you
 there,
 Sax.


>> How
 do
 you
 deal
 with
 now
 being
 in
 the


position
 you're
 in,
 having
 so
 many


people
 coming
 to
 you,
 I'm
 assuming,
 who


are
 lobbyists
 or
 studies
 or
 studies
 that


might
 have
 been
 paid
 for
 by
 a
 lobbyist


or
 an
 interested
 party
 and
 sort
 through


all
 this?
 Is
 there
 some
 disclosures


where
 they
 come
 in
 and
 they
 tell
 you,


"Hey,
 I
 want
 you
 to
 believe
 this,
 that,


and
 the
 other
 thing
 or
 want
 to
 lobby
 you


on
 behalf
 of
 putting
 in
 these
 controls,


taking
 these
 controls
 out."
 How
 does
 it


how
 do
 you
 manage
 all
 that?


>> How
 do
 you
 manage
 thousands
 of
 new


stories
 coming
 at
 you
 every
 day?
 You


just
 look
 at
 X.
 I
 mean,
 so
 you're
 I


mean,
 honestly,
 it's
 like
 the
 feed
 seems


to
 elevate
 and
 help
 you
 discover


interesting
 content.
 We
 saw
 this
 story.


Again,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 prejudge
 it


because
 I
 haven't
 dug
 into
 it
 enough
 to


say
 yet
 whether
 it's
 more
 than


interesting.
 But


>> I
 think
 that
 if
 I
 wanted
 to
 create


subtle
 chaos,
 what
 I
 would
 do
 is
 make


very
 small
 changes
 where
 none
 of
 these


things
 are
 at
 the
 obvious
 stupidity
 of
 a


black
 George
 Washington.
 But
 they
 can


start
 to
 set
 the
 trajectory
 of
 a


narrative
 forward
 and
 slowly
 over
 many


many many
 years
 change
 the
 underlying


content
 and
 what
 those
 models
 would
 do


would
 be
 training
 kids
 over
 years
 if
 not


decades
 one
 way
 of
 thinking
 versus


another.


>> You
 just
 Tik
 Tok


>> and
 no
 but
 this
 is
 on
 steroids.
 I
 100%


agree
 with
 that
 that's
 the
 endgame
 here.


By
 the
 way,
 in
 my
 opinion,
 that
 was
 the


endgame
 for
 the
 Biden
 approach
 of


requiring
 DEI
 values
 in
 these
 models.


>> Indoctrination.


>> Indoctrination
 100%.


>> 100%.
 All right,
 everybody.
 This
 has


been
 another
 amazing
 episode
 of
 the


All-In
 podcast.


>> See
 you
 next
 time.
 Byebye.


>> See
 you
 boys.
 Byebye.
 Byebye.


>> I
 got
 you.


We'll
 let
 your
 winners
 ride.


>> Rainman
 David


>> and
 it
 said
 we
 open
 sourced
 it
 to
 the


fans
 and
 they've
 just
 gone
 crazy
 with


it.
 Love
 you
 queen
 of
 quinoa.


[Music]


>> Besties
 are


my
 dog
 taking
 notice
 your
 driveways.


Oh
 man,
 my
 habitasher
 will
 meet
 up.


>> We
 should
 all
 just
 get
 a
 room
 and
 just


have
 one
 big
 huge
 orgy
 cuz
 they're
 all


just
 useless.
 It's
 like
 this
 like
 sexual


tension
 that
 we
 just
 need
 to
 release


somehow.


>> Your
 feet.


We
 need
 to
 get
 merch.


>> I'm
 going
 all
 in.


[Music]


>> I'm
 going
 all
 in.
