The U.N.
predicts that we will reach
peak humanity by 2083.
But now, more and more economists
like University of Pennsylvania professor
Hazard Fernandes
Villafuerte are saying that this U.N.
prediction is actually far too optimistic.
Instead, he argues that so 2055 will be
the year of peak humanity in size,
and we will start going down.
If this is true, economies around
the world will have to deal with pension
crises, reduced economic growth
and potential government debt crises
far faster than we thought.
So why are the UN predictions
that everyone, including me,
has been using so far, so wrong?
And what exactly does that mean
for the global economy?
As always, on money macro,
we have done a deep
dive into the relevant economic research,
taking the best arguments
plus supporting evidence
and summarize them for you.
Starting with argument
number one, far fewer
people are born today than the UN thinks.
Have a look at this graph from Colombia,
a country for which Professor Villar
recently made the case that the UN
is getting good birth rates.
Terribly wrong.
This line shows historical UN estimates
for how many new Colombians
are born in each year.
Meanwhile, this line shows the actual
births reported by Colombia's government.
As you can see,
the UN has roughly overestimated
the total number of Colombians
born by 30% for years.
That's a big number,
and we see similar gaps for other large
developing countries like Turkey, Egypt
and more recently, Mexico.
Mexico's case the trend even flipped.
For years, the UN underestimated births.
But in the last couple of years,
it started to overestimate them
there as well.
So why is the UN getting
the total number of births
for these major countries so wrong?
The problem is not that UN
researchers are using a bad methodology.
You see, in many poor nations, governments
genuinely
do not have a good idea
how many people are actually born.
For example, in ultra poor,
unstable countries
like South Sudan, Yemen and Madagascar,
of course,
the government does not have the capacity
to count all births.
So it makes sense that the UN makes
an estimate of how good the government
is at counting baby,
and then adds to that a number of babies.
To account for these inaccuracies,
the real problem, according to Valverde,
is that the UN itself
classifies
both Colombia and Turkey as countries
with almost complete
vital registration systems.
At least according to this index
of the UN's World Health Organization.
That's really strange.
The UN says the data is accurate,
and yet it makes a massive correction
by adding way more births
than the government says, meaning that
its population predictions
for these countries will be way too high.
And if this problem exists for medium
sized countries
like Colombia or Turkey,
imagine what it means for China,
which alone accounts for nearly one
sixth of the world's population.
Even tiny errors in Chinese
birth statistics
can shift global forecasts
by tens of millions of people.
The trouble is, though,
that China's official data are amongst
the most uncertain of all,
and some demographers
believe that the distortions here
could dwarf everything else.
Which brings us to our second reason
of why humanity
will shrink far faster than we thought.
China's births can't be trusted.
Specifically, Yi Fiction, a demographer
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
argues that China's population figures
are probably significantly inflated.
You see, in China, population
counts are done by local governments.
However, they have a very strong incentive
to inflate
their birth statistics before
sending them to the central government.
More babies,
after all, means more money from Beijing
for schools, pensions and poverty relief.
And as evidence for this, Fukuyama
gives the example that the regular numbers
sent in by local governments
in the year 2000
added up to 70.7 million births.
However, the national census done
that same year surprisingly
only counted 13.8 million infants
under one, leaving a 12% gap.
This problem will likely only get worse
now that the Chinese government explicitly
wants more kids and has pledged to reward
local governments that can deliver.
As evidence for this claim.
Fiction gave the example that when China
introduced the two child policy in 2016,
the National Health and Family
Planning Commission announced
18.85 million births,
827% jump from just the previous year,
and some provinces like Shandong
and Xinjiang reported increases of 56
and 75%, respectively.
However, crucially,
vaccine and school enrollment
data showed no corresponding rise,
giving us some pretty decent evidence
that this baby boom
was largely fabricated
to make the policy appear successful.
Yet despite the evidence,
China inflates its births,
the UN does not take this into account,
adding to the problem that the UN
probably believes far more
people are being born today
than are actually born today.
And yet it gets even worse.
So let's talk about the third
and arguably most important factor,
which makes the accuracy of UN predictions
so uncertain.
But first, let me tell you about what
I am really quite certain about,
which is that my two kids really
don't like to sit in the back of the car
for very long, which is a problem.
Our video
sponsor, salie, a super convenient essay
provider, has helped me out with a lot.
You see, we like taking our kids to
the mountains of Switzerland once a year.
But given that Switzerland is not in
the EU, I'd have to turn off
roaming and my GPS
when I drive into Switzerland next week.
So try a phone company, get a local eSIM
with two the screaming kids in the back.
No thanks.
This year
I have installed solar on my phone.
Then I choose my data plan well before
going on my trip for maximum comfort.
And in this case, I'm
going to take the Switzerland data plan.
And now it says got a coupon?
Yes, I do money Makro and bam,
there's my discount.
Problem solved.
Now I can just drive into Switzerland
and keep driving straight to my hotel.
And when I get there,
I do not have to rely on public Wi-Fi
to check the comments.
You guys are making under this video
and whenever I go somewhere else,
I just know how it works.
I open the save the app again
and get a new local SIM card.

And after you've done
that, let's turn to the third reason
why peak
humanity may be closer than we thought.
The UN is hopelessly optimistic
about fertility bouncing back.
Okay.
Have a look at this chart for fertility
in South Korea.
In the last decade, the number of babies
per woman has relentlessly fallen
from 1.2 to a staggering 0.7.
Luckily, the UN thinks it will start
bouncing back next year.
And hey,
that's actually the same year
when both Europe and China's
fertility will turn around as well.
Similarly,
after a relentless for the US's fertility
will completely stabilize
starting next year.
That seems absurd, doesn't it?
Of course, the UN is not stupid.
There is a reason for them to assume
fertility will bounce back at some point.
You see, in many of the most advanced
Western countries
like Germany, the US and France, fertility
did actually bounce back
when the societies adapted to provide
better child care services
and a better work life balance
for both working men and women.
This led the UN to rely on the idea that
fertility follows a three phase pattern.
In phase one,
the country starts with high fertility
and then in phase two, as they develop
and grow richer, fertility plummets.
In this case, fertility levels off
as it dips below replacement
and finally in phase
three, fertility recover slightly.
According to the UN, China,
the US and much of Europe should now be in
phase three, so they expect fertility
to rebound slightly.
But so far we haven't seen that.
And because nobody knows exactly
when this will happen,
the UN just assumes
the rebound starts right away.
And that's why their projections often
look so unrealistic.
Although, to be fair,
the UN's past forecasts have actually been
quite accurate on a global level.
In 1968, for instance, the UN projected
that the world's population
in 1990 would be 5.44 billion, remarkably
close to the actual 5.34 billion.
Similarly, in 2010,
the real global population was 7 billion,
compared to earlier UN projections
ranging from 6.8 to 7.2 billion.
Not bad at all.
Yet when it comes to recent
birth forecasts in specific countries,
especially rich or aging ones,
the record of the UN is far
less impressive.
Take South Korea again.
For years, the UN has predicted that
fertility would stabilize or start rising.
It never did.
The same pattern appears in Chile
and in Colombia.
The UN has consistently
overestimated birth rates
and other
estimated the speed of the decline.
So in this slide, these UN predictions
seem incredibly naive.
And it's not just skeptics
like Professor Villafuerte who think so.
Other major forecasting groups
like the Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation expect
global population to peak around 2064.
Now it gets worse.
The Vienna based AI as a puts
the peak even earlier, around 2018.
And finally, according to The Economist,
if current fertility trends continue
for just another 25 years, humanity
could already peak by 2065,
nearly two decades earlier than what
the UN expects.
This means all the alarming analysis
that you've seen about a global economic
slowdown and potential pension crises
could come far quicker than we thought.
So what does this mean for the global
economy?
Luckily, as I mentioned in my previous
analysis, the answer is not all bad.
Some regions,
like for example India and later Africa
may actually be heading
for a potentially great economy given
that they will experience what economists
call a demography dividend.
Thanks to a currently relatively young
population and fewer and fewer births,
these countries will enter an era
where they have a large population
of people who work, compared
to both the number of old people
and the number of children
who cannot work.
For example, this is the demographic
pyramid of India, where you can clearly
see a large building of young people
who recently entered the workforce.
Africa, on the other hand, is still
decades away from that turning point.
Right now,
high fertility means lots of children
and a heavy dependency burden,
which keeps growth potentially limited.
But around 2050, as fertility rates fall
and the working age
share of the population expands.
Africa could become the world's next major
growth engine.
But as you can see here in Europe, China
and Japan, their population pyramids
look drastically different.
This built of workers will soon
leave the workforce,
meaning fewer and fewer workers
will actually be economically productive.
As I mentioned in my previous video,
this will likely lead to Japan ification
of all major economies in East
Asia and Europe, which means slower
economic growth and higher government debt
as the population crisis intensifies.
We will see more and more countries
hit a government debt limit
that either will result in a debt crisis
or a cut to pension benefits.
This will have major implications
for the global balance of power as Japan
and Europe decline first, while China
and the US will follow suit a bit later.
And as a consequence of the same trend,
India will see its power increase first
and then decline as Africa
gets the demographic advantage.
These conclusions still stand, however,
thanks to the new data
presented in this video.
Many days
in my previous analysis will change.
Specifically, in that video,
I mentioned how China's
demographic backlash will come later,
but it will be very severe.
The fact that China has for a long time
misrepresented birth statistics, though,
may mean that it will follow the path
of Europe and Japan sooner.
But more broadly, as we have seen here.
Given the relentless full of fertility
in recent years, the global population
crisis will just come sooner everywhere
and will likely be more
severe than we previously thought.
But yeah, that's my take.
What do you think?
Have I been too harsh on the UN,
or do you agree that there's really strong
evidence that the world's
population will start falling far
faster than we thought?
