I
 am
 Ner
 of
 Tolia,
 the
 CEO
 and


co-founder
 of
 Next
 Door
 and
 someone
 who


has
 been
 fortunate
 to
 work
 in
 technology


for
 the
 last
 30
 years
 in
 Silicon
 Valley.


I
 am
 the
 son
 of
 two
 incredible
 Indian


immigrants
 who
 came
 to
 America
 truly


lived
 the
 American
 dream.
 The
 things


that
 I
 did
 naturally
 were
 more


entrepreneurial.
 I
 had
 a
 car
 wash.
 I
 had


a
 number
 of
 other
 neighborhood


businesses
 that
 made
 me
 feel
 like
 I


could
 create
 something
 out
 of
 nothing.


Next
 Door
 is
 now
 15
 years
 old,
 but


ultimately
 I
 wasn't
 growing
 with
 the


company.
 The
 things
 that
 I
 was
 doing
 as


a
 CEO
 were
 too
 similar
 to
 what
 we
 needed


in
 the
 early
 days
 and
 not
 tuned
 or


specific
 enough
 to
 what
 we
 needed
 to
 get


to
 the
 next
 level.
 And
 so
 the
 decision


was
 made
 and
 it
 was
 a
 very
 hard
 decision


that
 we
 needed
 new
 leadership.
 And
 I


left
 and
 for
 5
 and
 1/2
 years
 I
 was
 still


linked
 to
 Next
 Door
 and
 I
 still
 loved


the
 company,
 but
 I
 was
 on
 the
 sidelines,


not
 on
 the
 field.
 When
 I
 left
 Next
 Door


the
 first
 time,
 I
 spent
 five
 and
 a
 half


years
 primarily
 being
 an
 investor.
 One


of
 the
 really
 fun
 things
 I
 was
 able
 to


do
 as
 an
 investor
 is
 to
 go
 on
 this


popular
 show,
 Shark
 Tank.
 I
 went
 on
 as
 a


shark.
 But
 when
 I
 went
 on,
 I
 realized


something
 really
 interesting.
 I
 loved


being
 a
 shark
 and
 I
 admired
 my
 fellow


sharks.
 They
 were
 all
 very
 successful


business
 people.
 But
 my
 true
 admiration


was
 for
 the
 entrepreneurs
 because
 when


they
 walked
 in
 to
 pitch
 us
 on
 live


television,
 the
 pressure
 they
 were


feeling,
 the
 anxiety,
 the
 nervousness,
 I


know
 what
 that
 feels
 like
 because
 I
 felt


it.
 And
 so
 my
 empathy
 for
 those
 people


and
 what
 they
 were
 doing,
 it
 was
 very


different
 than
 just
 being
 an
 investor.


And
 ultimately,
 I
 came
 back
 to
 Next
 Door


because
 I
 loved
 investing,
 but
 I
 am
 an


entrepreneur.


Even
 today,
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 care
 most


about
 is
 having
 positive
 impact
 on
 the


world.
 It's
 not
 easy
 to
 work
 long
 hours.


There
 are
 lots
 of
 sacrifices.
 I
 want
 to


feel
 like
 I
 had
 a
 positive
 impact
 on
 the


world.
 And
 my
 way
 of
 doing
 that
 is
 by


building
 technology
 companies.


Nextdoor
 is
 the
 essential
 neighborhood


application.
 It's
 a
 social
 media
 service


that
 helps
 you
 get
 closer
 with
 the


people
 around
 you
 that
 makes
 your
 house


feel
 like
 a
 home
 and
 makes
 you
 come


together
 with
 your
 neighbors
 to
 build
 a


stronger,
 safer,
 and
 happier
 local


community.
 One
 of
 the
 big
 changes
 with


this
 version
 of
 Next
 Door,
 the
 Next
 Next


Door
 that
 we
 have
 recently
 released
 is


that
 we've
 integrated
 local
 news
 into


the
 service.
 The
 way
 that
 neighbors


learned
 about
 things
 that
 were
 going
 on


in
 their
 neighborhoods,
 even
 predating


the
 internet,
 was
 through
 local


newspapers.
 We're
 live
 in
 over
 11


countries
 around
 the
 world.
 As
 a
 public


company,
 we
 are
 also
 generating
 hundreds


of
 millions
 of
 dollars
 in
 revenue.
 But
 I


think
 the
 important
 thing
 is
 every


single
 day
 we
 know
 that
 neighbors
 use


Next
 Door
 to
 make
 their
 local


communities
 stronger.
 That
 was
 our
 dream


when
 we
 started
 the
 company
 and
 we
 know


it's
 happening
 today,
 which
 is
 so


fulfilling
 for
 us.


I
 was
 very
 lucky
 to
 be
 an
 undergrad
 at


Stanford
 and
 through
 that
 process
 I


heard
 of
 a
 young
 company
 that
 had
 just


been
 started
 by
 two
 other
 Stanford


students.
 The
 company
 was
 called
 Yahoo.


The
 year
 was
 1995
 1996
 and
 the
 internet


was
 just
 beginning
 to
 boom.
 Because
 of


my
 relationships
 at
 Stanford,
 I
 was
 able


to
 go
 and
 work
 at
 Yahoo
 as
 my
 first
 job


as
 one
 of
 the
 first
 100
 employees.
 And


it
 was
 the
 lucky
 break
 of
 a
 lifetime.


Being
 an
 early
 employee
 at
 Yahoo
 was


like
 winning
 a
 ticket
 in
 a
 lottery.


Yahoo
 in
 the
 mid90s
 was
 the
 hottest


internet
 company.
 It
 was
 the
 product


that
 not
 only
 was
 a
 shining
 beacon
 of


innovation
 in
 this
 new
 field,
 this
 new


dot
 era,
 it
 was
 a
 product
 that
 was


beloved
 by
 users.
 I
 would
 wear
 my
 Yahoo


t-shirt
 and
 walk
 down
 University
 Avenue


in
 Palo
 Alto,
 California,
 and
 so
 many


people
 would
 come
 up
 to
 me
 and
 tell
 me


how
 much
 they
 loved
 using
 Yahoo.
 The


first
 thing
 I
 would
 say
 about
 Yahoo
 is


it
 was
 a
 very
 humble
 place.
 Even
 amidst


its
 success,
 it
 was
 a
 very
 flat


organization.
 And
 I
 remember
 the
 first


week
 at
 Yahoo,
 I
 joined,
 one
 of
 the
 most


junior
 people,
 one
 of
 the
 youngest


people,
 a
 real
 nobody
 at
 the
 company.


And
 the
 car
 that
 I
 was
 driving,
 the


battery
 died
 and
 it
 couldn't
 start.


Guess
 who
 gave
 me
 a
 jump
 from
 his
 car?


One
 of
 the
 founders
 of
 Yahoo,
 who's
 gone


on
 to
 become
 a
 billionaire
 and
 an


internet
 celebrity.
 But
 that
 tells
 you


about
 the
 humility
 of
 the
 place.
 And
 it


wasn't
 just
 in
 helping
 a
 new
 employee


with
 a
 dead
 car
 battery.
 It
 was
 in


everything
 around
 building
 the
 company.


No
 task
 was
 too
 big.
 No
 task
 was
 too


small.
 It
 was
 not
 a
 hierarchical
 place.


It
 was
 a
 place
 where
 the
 quality
 of


ideas
 and
 the
 value
 of
 hard
 work
 is
 what


led
 to
 success.
 Yahoo
 was
 a
 place
 during


those
 days
 where
 almost
 every
 day
 that
 I


came
 to
 work,
 the
 metrics
 were
 better


because
 as
 great
 as
 Yahoo
 was
 as
 a


company,
 it
 was
 caught
 in
 a
 revolution


that
 was
 even
 bigger
 than
 any
 single


company.
 And
 that
 was
 the
 dotcom


revolution.
 And
 so
 we
 hear
 this


expression,
 in
 a
 rising
 tide,
 all
 boats


rise.
 Well,
 Yahoo
 was
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


and
 best
 boats,
 but
 it
 was
 the


beneficiary
 of
 that
 tide.
 And
 so
 over
 a


three-year
 period
 at
 Yahoo,
 I
 saw
 the


company
 grow
 from
 less
 than
 100


employees
 to
 over
 10,000.
 When
 I
 look


back
 at
 the
 lessons
 I
 learned
 at
 Yahoo,


particularly
 about
 building
 consumer


technology
 products,
 there's
 one
 that


stands
 above
 all
 the
 others,
 and
 that
 is


user
 value
 first.
 Google
 which
 came


after
 Yahoo
 has
 a
 saying,
 one
 of
 its


core
 principles.
 Follow
 the
 user
 first


and
 all
 else
 will
 take
 care
 of
 itself.


That
 is
 the
 way
 Yahoo
 operated
 and
 that


is
 what
 I
 want
 next
 door
 to
 be
 like.


You
 may
 ask
 why
 did
 I
 leave?
 Why
 did
 I


only
 spend
 three
 years
 at
 Yahoo?
 Well,


the
 truth
 is
 even
 though
 I
 loved
 being


there,
 something
 was
 missing.
 And
 that


thing
 that
 was
 missing
 is
 my
 direct


influence
 on
 the
 impact
 the
 company
 was


having.
 So
 after
 three
 amazing
 years
 at


Yahoo,
 I
 left
 to
 start
 my
 own
 company.


And
 I
 remember
 my
 goodbye
 party
 at


Yahoo.
 I
 was
 lucky
 enough
 to
 have
 Jerry


Yang,
 one
 of
 the
 founders
 there.
 And
 he


came
 over
 to
 me
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the


party
 and
 he
 said,
 "You
 know,
 I
 wish
 you


so
 much
 luck.
 I'm
 excited
 for
 you,
 but


I'm
 curious.
 Why
 are
 you
 leaving
 Yahoo?


No
 one
 is
 leaving
 this
 company
 right


now."
 And
 I
 said,
 'Jerry,
 when
 I
 think


about
 this
 amazing
 thing
 you've
 built,
 I


want
 to
 do
 the
 same
 thing.
 And
 he
 kind


of
 looked
 at
 me
 with
 a
 puzzled
 look
 and


I
 said, 'You
 understand
 that,
 right,


Jerry?
 And
 he
 said,
 "Yes,
 I
 do


understand
 it,
 but
 do
 you
 have
 any
 idea


how
 hard
 it
 is
 to
 build
 a
 company?"
 And


the
 truth
 is,
 I
 didn't.
 And
 one
 of
 the


amazing
 thing
 about
 entrepreneurs,
 one


of
 the
 amazing
 things
 is
 they
 don't
 know


how
 difficult
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 when
 they


start
 a
 company.
 If
 they
 did,
 they
 might


not
 begin
 in
 the
 first
 place.
 But
 I
 went


off,
 I
 started
 my
 own
 company,
 lots
 of


highs
 and
 lows,
 ultimately
 a
 pretty
 good


outcome.
 I
 went
 on
 to
 start
 multiple


other
 companies.
 I
 became
 an
 investor,


but
 all
 of
 it
 was
 because
 I
 wanted
 to
 be


an
 entrepreneur
 because
 I
 felt
 that
 was


the
 best
 way
 to
 have
 impact.


Almost
 30%
 of
 Americans
 could
 not
 name
 a


single
 neighbor
 by
 name.
 So
 those
 bonds


in
 the
 local
 community,
 they
 had
 been


eroding.
 We
 found
 a
 book
 called
 Bowling


Alone
 by
 Robert
 Putnham,
 the
 chair
 of


the
 sociology
 department
 at
 Harvard.
 And


the
 book
 was
 about
 the
 sport
 bowling
 and


its
 evolution
 in
 America
 and
 how
 the


popularity
 of
 the
 sport
 has
 not
 changed,


but
 people
 no
 longer
 bowl
 in
 bowling


leagues.
 They
 bowl
 alone.
 And
 it
 was
 a


symbol
 of
 the
 decline
 and
 erosion
 of


community.
 So
 we
 started
 to
 look
 around


in
 our
 industry,
 in
 our
 lives,
 in
 the


world
 in
 general.
 And
 here's
 what
 we


noticed.
 We
 noticed
 the
 emergence
 of


social
 media
 services.
 This
 was
 the


summer
 of
 2010.
 Facebook
 was
 starting
 to


really
 ascend.
 LinkedIn
 was
 starting
 to


ascend.
 Twitter,
 now
 called
 X,
 was


starting
 to
 ascend.
 And
 so,
 there
 was
 a


social
 platform
 connecting
 you
 to
 your


friends,
 connecting
 you
 to
 your
 business


colleagues,
 connecting
 you
 to
 people


that
 you
 found
 interesting.
 There
 wasn't


a
 social
 platform
 though
 that
 was


connecting
 you
 to
 the
 physical
 world
 in


which
 you
 lived,
 your
 neighborhood.
 And


so
 as
 we
 moved
 from
 what
 was
 happening


in
 the
 industry
 to
 what
 was
 happening
 in


our
 own
 lives,
 we
 were
 getting
 a
 little


older.
 We
 were
 getting
 more
 rooted
 in


our
 neighborhoods.
 We
 were
 less
 likely


to
 move
 away.
 We
 were
 more
 likely
 to


invest
 in
 the
 place
 that
 we'
 chosen
 to


live.
 But
 technology
 wasn't
 helping
 us


make
 those
 investments.
 The
 same
 way


Facebook
 was
 making
 it
 seamless
 for
 us


to
 communicate
 with
 friends
 that
 we


hadn't
 seen
 in
 years.
 There
 was
 no


technology
 service
 that
 was
 making
 it


easy
 to
 speak
 to
 the
 person
 next
 door.


Now
 we
 don't
 rely
 on
 that
 village
 of
 the


neighborhood
 where
 it
 does
 take
 a


village.
 We
 don't
 have
 it
 anymore.
 All


of
 those
 things
 compelled
 us,
 really


inspired
 us
 to
 think,


can
 we
 create
 a
 social
 media
 service


that's
 focused
 on
 what
 we
 believe
 is
 one


of
 the
 most
 important
 parts
 of
 our


lives,
 and
 that
 is
 our
 local
 community.


The
 idea
 was
 the
 neighborhood
 is
 one
 of


the
 most
 important
 communities
 of
 them


all.
 And
 ironically,
 while
 technology


may
 have
 caused
 us
 to
 retreat
 away
 from


our
 neighborhoods
 and
 onto
 our
 screens,


can
 we
 use
 those
 same
 screens
 to
 bring


us
 back
 to
 our
 neighborhoods?
 And
 that


was
 the
 original
 vision


to
 hear
 from
 actual
 neighbors
 what
 they


wanted
 in
 a
 technology
 tool
 to
 make


their
 neighborhood
 stronger,
 safer,
 and


happier.
 And
 so
 before
 we
 wrote
 a
 line


of
 code,
 before
 we
 designed
 a
 single


interface,
 before
 we
 thought
 about
 the


business
 model,
 we
 simply
 drew
 a
 mockup


on
 a
 piece
 of
 paper
 and
 we
 showed
 it
 to


neighbors
 and
 we
 let
 them
 respond.
 And


very
 quickly,
 we
 found
 out
 that
 there


were
 no
 existing
 technology
 tools
 that


were
 bringing
 people
 together
 locally.


We
 could
 use
 technology
 to
 speak
 to


people
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 the
 world
 in


real
 time,
 but
 there
 was
 no
 technology


tool
 that
 would
 introduce
 us
 to
 the


person
 right
 across
 the
 street.
 And
 so


instantly
 we
 knew
 there
 was
 an


opportunity.
 But
 the
 problem
 is
 when
 we


started
 the
 company,
 the
 need
 for
 next


door
 existed
 because
 people
 didn't
 know


their
 neighbors.
 So
 if
 you
 don't
 know


your
 neighbors,
 how
 do
 you
 invite
 them


to
 a
 service?
 And
 this
 was
 a
 paradoxical


challenge
 for
 us
 from
 the
 very


beginning.
 The
 value
 we
 were
 looking
 to


create
 was
 squarely
 in
 the
 way
 of
 us


being
 able
 to
 build
 that
 value
 in
 the


first
 place.
 And
 so
 we
 had
 to
 invest
 in


really
 understanding
 the
 manual
 ways
 to


get
 the
 first
 few
 people
 in
 the


neighborhood
 and
 make
 sure
 they
 were
 the


right
 few
 people.
 And
 then
 we
 had
 to


invest
 in
 offline
 mechanisms,
 flyers,


postcards.
 People
 used
 to
 laugh
 at
 us


and
 say,
 "Let
 me
 get
 this
 straight.


You're
 using
 real
 paper,
 like
 dead
 tree


paper,
 to
 advertise
 your
 service."
 And


we
 would
 say,
 "Well,
 our
 service
 is


about
 the
 real
 world,
 and
 we
 aren't


advertising
 using
 flyers
 and
 postcards.


our
 neighbors
 are
 using
 those
 mechanisms


to
 tell
 their
 neighbors
 who
 they
 don't


know
 about
 this
 new
 service.


It
 ended
 up
 working.
 We're
 in
 over
 90%


of
 neighborhoods
 in
 the
 country,
 but
 it


was
 very
 slow,
 although
 it
 was
 steady.


And
 one
 of
 the
 learnings
 for
 us
 is
 that


great
 community
 building
 happens
 bottoms


up.
 It
 can't
 happen
 top
 down.
 And


sometimes
 that
 means
 it's
 slow
 but


steady
 versus
 fast
 and
 instant.
 And
 we


live
 in
 an
 industry
 where
 companies
 seem


to
 grow
 with
 the
 snap
 of
 fingers.


Where
 successes
 are
 called
 overnight


successes.


But
 long-term
 value
 and
 community,
 which


is
 a
 uniquely
 human
 value,
 well,
 that's


something
 like
 trust
 that
 takes
 a
 lot
 of


time
 to
 build.
 You
 can
 lose
 it


instantly,
 but
 to
 gain
 it
 takes
 repeated


effort.
 And
 so
 all
 of
 our
 challenges,


they've
 all
 been
 in
 the
 variety
 of


choosing
 in
 many
 cases
 the
 hard
 thing
 to


do
 because
 it's
 the
 thing
 that's
 going


to
 drive
 the
 most
 long-term
 value
 when


in
 almost
 every
 case
 the
 conventional


wisdom
 is
 go
 and
 do
 the
 things
 that
 you


can
 do
 quickly
 and
 easily
 and


efficiently.
 But
 for
 us,
 it's
 about


choosing
 the
 things
 that
 build


community.
 And
 in
 almost
 all
 cases,


those
 are
 the
 things
 that
 take
 forever.


Being
 a
 founder,
 being
 a
 CEO,
 being
 an


executive,
 it's
 a
 lonely
 journey.


It's
 not
 easy
 to
 talk
 about
 the


struggle.
 It's
 not
 easy
 to
 confide
 in


people.
 You
 want
 to
 be
 the
 person
 who's


confident,
 who's
 optimistic,
 who's


secure
 that
 what
 we're
 doing
 is
 the


right
 thing.
 But
 in
 reality,


it's
 very,
 very,
 very
 challenging.
 And


there
 are
 many
 moments
 when
 you're


unsure
 of
 yourself.
 How
 do
 you
 get


around
 those
 moments?
 For
 me,
 I
 would


tell
 entrepreneurs
 and
 founders,
 the


solution
 has
 been
 to
 first
 focus
 on
 who


and
 then
 what.
 And
 that
 means
 first


thinking
 about
 your
 teammates
 versus
 the


business
 opportunity.
 So
 many
 founders


start
 by
 saying
 what
 is
 the
 business


opportunity
 here?
 What
 is
 the
 vision


that
 we're
 trying
 to
 build?
 What
 is
 the


company
 we
 want
 to
 create?
 I
 always


started
 by
 saying
 who
 do
 I
 want
 to
 work


with?
 Who
 is
 going
 to
 be
 my
 set
 of


co-founders?
 Because
 I
 know
 that
 when


I'm
 alone,
 the
 lows
 are
 even
 lower.
 And


frankly,
 the
 highs
 are
 not
 as
 high.
 But


when
 I'm
 with
 a
 group
 of
 people,
 my


community,
 when
 I
 think
 about
 we,
 not


me,
 those
 lows,
 they
 can
 be
 overcome.


And
 those
 highs,
 they
 are
 sublime


because
 I'm
 sharing
 them
 with
 someone


else.
 And
 so,
 the
 number
 one
 piece
 of


advice
 that
 I
 give
 founders
 that
 I
 would


give
 anyone
 trying
 to
 do
 something
 hard,


first
 focus
 on
 who.
 And
 when
 I
 thought


deeply
 about
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 felt
 had


gone
 really
 well,
 but
 sometimes
 not
 so


well
 and
 needed
 to
 go
 better,
 it
 was
 all


around
 motivating
 my
 teammates.
 How
 am
 I


interacting
 with
 my
 fellow
 employees?


And
 ultimately
 what
 I
 realized
 is


leadership
 is
 about
 lifting
 people
 up.


It's
 about
 celebrating
 their


accomplishments.
 It's
 about
 helping
 them


when
 they
 feel
 stuck.
 Yes,
 we
 need
 to


have
 incredibly
 high
 standards.
 Yes,
 we


need
 to
 always
 be
 shooting
 for
 the


stars.
 Yes,
 performance
 is
 absolutely


the
 single
 most
 important
 thing
 in


driving
 success.
 You
 have
 to
 perform.


We're
 a
 public
 company.
 But
 as
 leaders,


we
 can
 do
 that
 by
 championing
 people,


not
 beating
 them
 down.
 And
 when
 I


thought
 about
 my
 decades
 as
 a
 CEO,
 there


were
 many
 moments
 where
 my
 frustration,


my
 stress,
 and
 the
 demands
 that
 I
 put
 on


myself
 ultimately
 manifested
 as
 me
 being


hard
 on
 people.
 I
 think
 it's
 okay
 to
 be


hard,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 be
 supportive.


It's
 okay
 to
 be
 demanding,
 but
 you
 need


to
 be
 empathetic.
 And
 ultimately,
 every


single
 one
 of
 my
 colleagues,
 I
 know
 they


can
 get
 jobs
 at
 many
 other
 companies,


and
 it's
 a
 privilege
 they've
 chosen
 to


work
 with
 me
 at
 Next
 Door.
 And
 so
 my
 job


as
 a
 CEO
 and
 I
 believe
 the
 key
 job
 of


leaders
 is
 to
 lift
 people
 up
 and
 make


them
 feel
 like
 they
 can
 do
 their
 best


work.
 And
 if
 that
 happens,
 the
 company


can
 be
 and
 will
 be
 successful.


Companies
 like
 everything
 else
 in
 the


world,
 they
 need
 to
 evolve.
 They
 need
 to


evolve
 within
 their
 four
 walls
 and
 they


need
 to
 actually
 harmonize
 what
 they're


doing
 with
 the
 outside
 world.
 The
 way
 to


evolve
 your
 company
 as
 a
 leader
 is
 to


first
 evolve
 yourself.
 And
 so
 what
 I


found
 in
 trying
 to
 become
 AI
 first,
 AI


fluent,
 AI
 native,
 all
 of
 these
 things


that
 we
 know
 are
 critical
 in
 today's


world.
 I
 have
 to
 use
 AI
 myself.
 I
 can't


rely
 on
 the
 old
 ways
 of
 doing
 things.


The
 question
 is
 if
 you
 could
 recreate


your
 company
 from
 scratch,
 how
 would
 you


use
 AI
 from
 day
 one?
 And
 that
 is
 the


mindset.
 It's
 a
 business
 theory
 called


zero
 basing.
 It's
 not
 taking
 something


and
 slowly
 evolving
 it.
 It's
 taking


something
 and
 pretending
 that
 it's
 going


to
 be
 brand
 new
 and
 using
 the
 benefits


of
 the
 new
 technology
 to
 build
 it
 from


its
 foundation
 using
 the
 new
 technology.


It's
 not
 good
 enough
 to
 simply
 say,
 "How


can
 I
 use
 AI
 to
 make
 my
 business


stronger?"
 The
 question
 is,
 if
 I
 were


starting
 my
 business
 today,


how
 would
 AI
 play
 a
 role
 in
 making
 it


possible?
 That's
 actually
 the
 mindset


shift
 that
 will
 get
 people
 to
 truly
 be


AI
 native.
 And
 so
 ultimately
 we
 need
 to


use
 artificial
 intelligence


to
 train
 systems
 LLMs


on
 what
 a
 neighborhood
 thinks
 is


appropriate
 and
 what
 they
 believe
 that


level
 of
 bias
 should
 or
 shouldn't
 be.
 If


we
 try
 to
 approach
 it
 from
 a
 top-
 down


basis
 and
 say
 these
 are
 nextdoor's


rules,
 well
 we
 can
 come
 up
 with
 simple


things.
 Be
 civil,
 be
 neighborly,
 be


kind,
 be
 helpful.
 But
 bias
 is
 not
 in


those
 kinds
 of
 situations.
 Bias
 is
 more


things
 like,
 is
 it
 appropriate
 to
 have
 a


conversation
 about
 local
 politics?
 Is
 it


appropriate
 to
 advertise
 one
 small


business?
 In
 some
 neighborhoods,
 it
 is.


In
 others,
 commercialism
 is
 looked
 down


on.
 The
 power
 of
 artificial
 intelligence


is
 that
 for
 all
 350,000
 of
 our


neighborhoods,
 we
 have
 15
 years
 of


conversations.
 We
 can
 now
 take
 AI,
 run


all
 of
 those
 conversations
 on
 a


neighborhood
 by
 neighborhood
 basis


through
 an
 LLM
 to
 define
 a
 set
 of
 biases


and
 rules
 of
 the
 road,
 if
 you
 will,


cultural
 norms
 that
 are
 not
 top
 down,


but
 that
 are
 bottoms
 up.
 A
 set
 of


cultural
 norms
 for
 every
 single
 one
 of


those
 individual
 neighborhoods.
 The


backdrop
 for
 me
 and
 I
 hope
 the
 backdrop


for
 many
 companies
 and
 individuals
 will


always
 be
 how
 do
 we
 use
 this
 technology


tool
 to
 make
 the
 human
 race
 better?
 Not


to
 put
 the
 human
 race
 out
 of
 existence,


which
 is
 the
 real
 fear.
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 going
 to
 happen.
 It
 hasn't
 happened


in
 the
 past.
 But
 the
 reason
 it
 hasn't


and
 the
 reason
 it
 won't
 is
 because


people
 will
 continue
 to
 internalize
 that


it's
 all
 about
 the
 human.
 It's
 all
 about


what
 makes
 us
 people.
 And
 that's
 not


something
 even
 artificial
 general


intelligence
 will
 be
 able
 to


approximate.
 And
 so
 as
 long
 as
 we


remember
 that,
 this
 will
 be
 the
 most


powerful
 tool
 so
 far
 in
 the
 history
 of


technology,
 but
 still
 a
 tool
