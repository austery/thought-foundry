 Uh
 Gal,
 thanks
 so
 much
 for


joining
 us
 here.
 What's
 the
 feeling
 in


Israel
 today
 as
 these
 hostages
 come


home?


>> I
 think
 um
 for
 almost
 everyone
 in


Israel,
 this
 is
 a
 very
 um
 happy
 day.


We've
 been
 seeing
 um
 tens
 of
 thousands


of
 Israelis
 flock
 um
 since
 early
 this


morning
 to
 Tel
 Aviv's
 hostage
 square


which
 has
 become
 a
 sort
 of
 gathering


point
 um
 over
 the
 past
 2
 years
 for
 those


who
 have
 been
 advocating
 for
 the
 release


of
 the
 hostages
 and
 um
 it
 was
 quite
 a


sight
 today
 seeing
 um
 about
 like
 I
 said


60
 70,000
 people
 um
 in
 the
 square
 and
 in


all
 the
 surrounding
 streets
 um
 with
 a


big
 stage
 that
 um
 kept
 broadcasting
 the


images
 of
 the
 hostages
 is
 coming
 out.


People
 were
 chanting
 and
 clapping
 their


hands
 and
 singing
 and
 cheering
 and
 it


was
 um
 indeed
 a
 very
 um
 happy
 day
 and
 I


think
 um
 a
 sense
 of
 relief
 for
 a
 lot
 of


Israelis
 here.


>> There
 was
 a
 moment
 in
 that
 speech
 when


President
 Trump
 uh
 was
 talking
 to
 Prime


Minister
 Netanyahu
 directly
 and
 he
 said


he
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 guts
 uh
 for
 knowing
 when


to
 stop
 the
 fighting
 and
 for
 stopping


the
 fighting
 when
 when
 he
 did.
 Just
 get


us
 up
 to
 speed
 here
 on
 what
 these
 last


few
 days
 have
 been
 been
 like.
 We
 had


President
 Trump
 unveiling
 this
 this


peace
 plan
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 ago.
 The


devil
 is
 in
 the
 details.
 Of
 course,
 we


were
 talking
 about
 that
 just
 a
 few


moments
 ago.
 What's
 going
 to
 happen
 here


in
 Egypt
 and
 and
 going
 forward,
 but
 just


just
 explain
 what
 President
 Trump
 was


able
 to
 do,
 how
 he
 was
 able
 to
 convince


Prime
 Minister
 Netanyahu
 to
 stop
 that


assault
 on
 on
 Gaza
 City
 that
 was


underway.


>> Yeah.
 So
 we
 to
 be
 to
 be
 very
 honest
 and


transparent,
 I
 think
 we
 only
 know
 like


part
 of
 the
 question
 the
 answer
 to
 that


question
 at
 this
 stage.
 But
 overall
 um


you
 know
 Netanyahu
 has
 has
 generally
 um


insisted
 that
 Israel
 cannot
 stop


fighting
 in
 Gaza
 and
 cannot
 stop


fighting
 Hamas
 until
 it
 is
 totally


defeated
 until
 it's
 um
 completely
 out
 of


power
 and
 until
 all
 of
 its
 military
 um


capabilities
 are
 are
 taken
 out.
 And
 what


happened
 here
 is
 that
 um
 Trump
 I
 think


um
 along
 you
 know
 with
 um
 Steve
 Witkov


and
 Jared
 Kushner
 they
 um
 managed
 to
 do


a
 few
 things.
 On
 the
 one
 hand,
 they


managed
 um
 to
 convince
 um
 Hamas
 um
 by


themselves
 through
 mediators
 that
 to
 to


give
 up
 all
 the
 hostages
 at
 once,
 at


least
 all
 the
 living
 hostages,
 because


there
 are
 still
 28
 um
 dead
 hostages
 that


remain
 in
 Gaza.
 And
 we
 understand
 that


only
 um
 about
 four
 of
 them
 are
 going
 to


be
 brought
 back
 today.
 Um
 so
 so
 that's


one
 thing
 they
 managed
 to
 do.
 But
 in


turn
 um
 what
 Kamas
 wanted
 was
 guarantees


um
 that
 the
 war
 will
 in
 fact
 end
 after


that
 happens
 and
 that
 Israel
 doesn't


just
 get
 all
 the
 hostages
 back
 and
 then


goes
 back
 to
 fighting.
 And
 um
 you
 know


Trump
 has
 basically
 um
 personally


guaranteed
 that
 this
 will
 happen
 and


that
 the
 war
 will
 end.
 And
 we've
 heard


him
 say
 multiple
 times
 today
 on
 the
 way


to
 Israel
 on
 Air
 Force
 One
 when
 he
 came


to
 the
 Israeli
 parliament
 that
 this
 is


the
 end
 of
 war
 and
 that
 the
 US
 will
 will


make
 sure
 that's
 what
 happens.
 So
 I


think
 these
 are,
 you
 know,
 the
 two


things
 that
 that
 m
 made
 a
 difference.


You
 know,
 the
 the
 biggest
 sticking
 point


moving
 forward
 will
 be
 whether
 Kamas


some
 agrees
 to
 disarm.
 Um
 Trump's


20point
 plan
 says
 that
 that's
 what
 Kamas


has
 to
 do.
 Hamas
 haven't
 agreed
 to
 do


that
 yet
 and
 that's
 what
 Israel
 insists


on.
 Um
 so
 we'll
 have
 to
 see
 how
 that


plays
 out.
 But
 the
 sense
 is
 that
 the
 war


at least
 as
 we
 as
 we've
 known
 it
 in
 the


past
 two
 years
 has
 um
 in
 fact
 come
 come


to
 an
 end.
 That's
 what
 it
 looks
 like


today.

 you

 much

>> Let's
 check
 in
 with
 Lori
 Calvina,
 a
 head


of
 US
 equity
 strategy
 for
 RBC
 Capital


Markets.
 Lori,
 it's
 kind
 of
 seems
 to
 be


trade
 is
 one
 of
 the
 drivers
 of
 kind
 of


market
 sentiment
 these
 days.
 We
 got
 a


maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 softening
 of


tone
 from
 President
 Trump
 as
 it
 relates


to
 China.
 And
 I
 guess
 that's
 what
 the


market
 likes
 to
 see
 here.
 What
 are
 you


making
 of
 today's
 uh
 pre-market
 action?


>> Well,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me,
 Paul.
 Look,


I
 mean,
 it's
 not
 unexpected
 to
 get
 a
 bit


of
 a
 bounce,
 right,
 after
 kind
 of
 the


big
 drop
 that
 we
 saw
 on
 Friday.
 I
 think


it's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 interesting
 to


see
 how
 the
 S&P
 500
 trades
 today.
 The


kids
 are
 out
 of
 school
 in
 New
 York
 City.


Um
 I'm
 guessing
 other
 parts
 of
 the


country
 as
 well.
 Um
 they're
 thankfully


not
 running
 around
 here
 for
 me.
 Um
 but


the
 you
 know
 it
 is
 a
 quiet
 day
 on
 Wall


Street,
 right?
 So
 let's
 see
 what
 we
 get


in
 terms
 of
 the
 price
 action.
 But
 I


think
 tomorrow
 is
 really
 going
 to
 be
 um


you
 know
 kind
 of
 the
 the
 day
 where
 I


think
 we
 start
 to
 hear
 a
 bit
 more
 from


folks
 um
 you
 know
 in
 terms
 of
 how


they're
 digesting
 this.
 And
 look,
 I'll


tell
 you
 Paul,
 as
 I
 think
 back
 over
 the


last
 three
 weeks,
 I've
 been
 in
 the
 UK.


I've
 been
 running
 around
 the
 US
 to
 more


cities
 than
 I
 can
 count
 and
 keep
 track


of
 at
 this
 point
 and
 I
 heard
 a
 whole
 lot


of
 things
 about
 people
 that
 they
 were


worried
 about.
 Valuations,
 AI,
 capex,


rate
 cut,
 pricing
 got
 pulled
 forward
 in


the
 stock
 market,
 um
 labor,
 um


inflation,
 you
 know,
 is
 that
 going
 to


start
 to
 percolate
 soon?
 Are
 we
 going
 to


see
 more
 of
 a
 growth
 response
 to
 tariffs


um
 in
 the
 market?
 But
 the
 one
 thing
 I


was
 not
 hearing
 about
 was
 that
 things


could,
 you
 know,
 start
 escalating
 again


with
 China.
 So,
 I
 think
 what
 we
 learned


on
 Friday
 was
 that
 a
 fair
 amount
 of,
 you


know,
 we're
 on
 a
 good
 path.
 Um,
 things


are
 headed
 in
 the
 right
 direction.
 That


was
 really
 kind
 of
 a
 firm
 underpinning


of
 this
 market.
 So,
 we
 need
 to
 see
 how


that
 plays
 out.


>> Um,
 it
 seems
 like
 quarter
 after
 quarter,


Lori,
 going
 into
 earnings
 season,


financials
 are
 held
 up
 as
 a
 bell


weather,
 something
 that's
 going
 to
 tell


us
 about
 the
 health
 of
 the
 market.
 It's


going to
 give
 us
 some
 insight
 into
 the


economy
 as
 well.
 So,
 tomorrow
 we've
 got


JP
 Morgan,
 Goldman
 Sachs,
 Cityroup.
 On


the
 heels
 of
 that,
 uh,
 we've
 got
 Bank
 of


America
 and
 Morgan
 Stanley
 on
 on


Wednesday.
 In
 this
 odd
 economy,
 in
 this


moment,
 what
 are
 those
 particular


companies
 going
 to
 tell
 us?


>> So,
 you
 know,
 we'll
 see
 what
 they
 have


to
 say.
 Earnings
 revisions
 have
 been


pretty
 resilient
 there.
 Um,
 so
 my
 guess


is
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 have,
 you
 know,


some
 pretty
 good
 messaging
 coming
 out
 of


them,
 but
 we'll
 have
 to
 see.
 Um,
 the


reality
 though,
 your
 comment
 about
 the


bell
 weather,
 this
 was
 something
 we


wrote
 about
 in
 our
 weekly
 today.
 And
 if


I
 go
 back
 the
 last
 couple
 reporting


seasons,
 you
 know,
 I
 could
 summarize,


you
 know,
 what
 we've
 been
 hearing
 from


the
 banks
 and
 and
 especially
 the
 big


banks
 as
 don't
 worry
 about
 the
 consumer.


Everything's
 fine.
 The
 stats
 all
 look


good.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 we're
 really,
 you


know,
 proud
 of
 our
 consumers
 for
 being


more
 choiceful
 in
 their
 purchases.
 Um,


but
 don't
 worry,
 things
 aren't
 cracking.


And
 that's
 that's
 not
 wrong,
 right?
 I


mean,
 that's
 what
 they're
 seeing
 in
 the


data.
 That's
 one
 perspective.
 But
 the


problem
 is
 that
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people


in
 the
 financial
 community
 that
 go


around
 saying
 that
 as
 evidence
 of


there's
 nothing
 to
 worry
 about.
 And
 if


you
 actually
 go
 and
 listen
 to
 the


consumer
 companies
 who
 have
 the
 boots
 on


the
 ground
 feel,
 you
 know,
 there's
 some


really
 uh
 you
 know,
 not
 troubling,


that's
 not
 quite
 the
 word
 I
 want
 to
 use,


but
 there
 are
 some
 problems.
 And
 so
 for


example,
 what
 we've
 noticed
 in
 the


recent
 consumer
 companies
 kind
 of
 those


late
 cycle
 rep
 offcycle
 reporters
 kind


of
 that
 came
 at
 the
 last
 tail
 end
 of
 the


reporting
 season,
 they
 were
 talking
 not


just
 about
 the
 low-income
 consumer
 being


stressed,
 but
 the
 middle
 income
 consumer


being
 stressed.
 There
 was
 one
 company


over
 the
 last
 few
 weeks
 that
 said
 they


were
 seeing
 stress
 in
 the
 consumer


worldwide.
 We
 had
 another
 company
 that


was
 talking
 about
 how
 socioeconomic


issues
 are
 pressuring
 consumers
 across


cohorts.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 we
 really
 need


to
 take
 the
 financials
 with
 a
 grain
 of


salt.
 It's
 an
 important
 perspective.


It's
 one
 that
 we
 absolutely
 want
 to
 have


and
 find
 valuable,
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time,


they're
 not
 able
 to
 give
 us
 the
 full


picture
 because
 only
 the
 consumer


companies
 are
 really
 able
 to
 tell
 us


about
 the
 composition
 of
 the
 spend
 under


the
 surface.


>> So
 Lori,
 given
 that
 earnings
 are
 kicking


off
 here,
 um
 let's
 put
 that
 in
 context


of
 of
 valuation
 here.
 What
 are
 the


discussions
 you're
 having
 with
 your


clients
 these
 days
 about
 valuation


across
 the
 market?


>> Everyone's
 worried.
 Um
 everyone's
 got


sticker
 shock.
 And
 if
 you
 just
 look
 at


our
 charts
 on
 just
 say
 the
 S&P
 500


market
 cap
 weighted
 PE,
 you
 can
 do
 the


same
 thing
 on
 the
 NASDAQ
 100
 either
 cap


weighted
 or
 equal
 weighted.
 And
 we
 also


look
 at
 the
 top
 10
 names
 in
 the
 S&P
 500.


And
 you've
 basically
 got
 forward
 PE


levels
 that
 are
 sitting
 in
 line
 with
 the


recent
 highs.
 Not
 necessarily
 tech


bubble
 highs,
 not
 necessarily
 all-time


highs,
 but
 highs
 that
 in
 recent
 years


have
 been
 difficult
 for
 the
 market
 to


move
 past.
 So
 you're
 not
 getting
 any


valuation
 expansion
 in
 this
 market.
 And


I
 think
 that's
 something,
 you
 know,
 the


bottom-up
 stock
 pickers
 I
 talked
 to,


frankly,
 are
 picking
 up
 on,
 and
 I
 think


they're
 somewhat
 alarmed
 at
 some
 of
 the


levels
 that
 they're
 seeing
 um
 in
 some
 of


their
 portfolios.
 So,
 I
 do
 think
 that


earnings
 are
 really
 the
 big
 driver
 here.


And
 we
 have
 seen
 a
 fade
 in
 earnings


sentiment.
 Now,
 that
 doesn't
 mean


earnings
 are
 going to
 be
 a
 disaster,
 but


the
 big
 pop
 in
 earnings
 surprises
 that


we
 got
 in
 the
 last
 reporting
 season,
 I


don't
 think
 that
 we're
 set
 up
 to
 repeat


that.


>> Uh
 Paul,
 you
 weren't
 here.
 I
 was
 filling


in
 for
 you.
 Lori
 was
 on
 and
 I
 brought
 up


the
 fact
 that
 it
 seemed
 like
 analyst


after
 analyst
 and
 strategist
 after


strategist
 was
 was
 touting
 how
 this
 was


a
 moment
 for
 small
 caps.
 And
 I
 I
 asked


Lori
 if
 she
 agreed
 with
 that.
 And
 Lori


rightly
 brought
 out
 her
 CV
 and
 touted


her
 bonafides
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 her


experience
 analyzing
 uh
 uh
 small
 caps
 in


in
 in
 in
 her
 previous
 life.
 Uh
 and
 she


was
 skeptical,
 I
 think
 I
 could
 say,


about
 the
 the
 prospects
 for
 small
 caps.


And
 I
 would
 invite
 her
 to
 take
 a
 bit
 of


a
 victory
 lap
 here.
 Lori,
 what
 is
 your


sense
 of
 where
 small
 caps
 are
 head?
 What


does
 that
 tell
 you
 about
 the
 market
 more


broadly?


>> Well,
 look,
 David,
 I
 mean,
 I
 always


describe
 small
 caps
 as
 my
 first


professional
 child.
 So,
 there's
 no
 one


more
 than
 me
 who
 wants
 them
 to
 succeed


and
 wants
 them
 to
 have
 that
 moment
 in


the
 sun
 and
 wants
 them
 to
 have
 that


leadership
 shift.
 But,
 frankly,
 you


know,
 I
 I
 felt
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 I
 was


shouting
 into
 the
 abyss
 over
 the
 last


few
 months
 while
 the
 street
 was
 just


going
 bananas
 on
 talking
 about
 small


caps
 and
 calling
 for
 the
 beginning
 of


this
 big
 outperformance
 cycle.
 And
 based


on
 what
 I'm
 seeing
 in
 the
 recent
 trading


data,
 it
 looks
 like,
 you
 know,
 it's
 kind


of
 fizzled
 out
 once
 again.
 And
 that's


not
 to
 say
 there's
 not
 incremental


upside
 in
 absolute
 terms,
 but
 we're
 no


longer
 seeing
 this
 part
 of
 the
 market


outperform
 the
 S&P
 or
 outperform
 the


NASDAQ
 100.
 It
 looks
 like
 it
 may
 have


just
 been
 another
 rate
 cut
 bet
 that


fizzled
 out
 pretty
 quickly.
 Um,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 as
 we
 kind
 of
 head
 into


earning
 season,
 one
 of the
 interesting


things
 on
 small
 caps
 that's
 been
 coming


up
 recently
 is
 whatever
 challenges
 that


are
 out
 there,
 you
 know,
 whether
 it's,


you
 know,
 tariffs,
 for
 example,
 back


when
 we
 had
 the
 tight
 labor
 market


postco,
 small
 caps
 just
 have
 a
 difficult


time
 managing
 around
 those
 challenges


relative
 to
 their
 big
 cap
 companies.
 Um,


so
 that's
 one
 of the
 things
 I'm
 going
 to


be
 looking
 for
 in
 this
 reporting
 season


is
 to
 see
 how
 small
 caps
 are
 managing


through
 relative
 to
 their
 big
 cap


counterparts.
 So
 Lori,
 given
 that


backdrop,
 what
 screens
 well
 for
 you


guys?
 I'm
 not
 sure
 if
 you
 do
 it
 by


sector
 or
 by
 factor,
 something
 jumping


out
 at
 you
 guys
 that
 kind
 of
 gets
 your


interest.


>> So
 we
 mostly
 focus
 on
 sectors
 and
 we


continue
 to
 like
 the
 financial
 sector.


Um,
 you
 know,
 frankly,
 if
 we
 get
 a


pullback
 in
 the
 market,
 they
 may
 not,


you
 know,
 sort
 of
 hold
 up
 better
 on
 the


way
 down.
 Um,
 they
 are
 cyclical
 in


nature.
 Um,
 but
 we're
 not
 really


concerned
 about
 that.
 What
 we've
 said
 is


we
 like
 them
 on
 a
 6
 to
 12
 month
 view.
 So


there
 is
 incremental
 weakness
 on
 a


relative
 basis.
 In
 a
 short
 term,
 we'd


still
 use
 that
 as
 a
 buying
 opportunity.


Earnings
 revisions
 have
 been
 very


resilient
 relative
 to
 other
 sectors.


We're
 basically
 seeing
 the
 rate
 of


upward
 revisions
 fade
 for
 most
 sectors


in
 the
 S&P
 500.
 X
 technology
 financials


has
 had
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 fade,
 but
 it's


kind
 of
 pald
 in
 comparison
 to
 what
 we've


seen
 elsewhere.
 Banks,
 consumer
 finance,


um,
 insurance
 all
 screen
 well
 on
 our


valuation
 and
 earnings
 work.
 And
 I


didn't
 upgrade
 it,
 but
 one
 of the
 things


we
 have
 been
 talking
 about
 in
 recent


reports,
 and
 we
 actually
 said
 this


specifically
 in
 the
 weekly
 we
 put
 out


this
 morning,
 is
 that
 health
 care
 is


starting
 to
 look
 a
 bit
 more
 interesting,


especially
 if
 you
 think
 there's
 a
 market


pullback
 that's
 already
 started
 or
 may


be
 on
 the
 horizon.
 We
 are
 neutral
 all


four
 of
 the
 defensive
 sectors,
 but


healthc
 care
 is
 one
 that's
 been
 coming


up
 in
 conversation
 recently.
 Valuations


look
 good.
 Earnings
 revisions
 have
 been


a
 touch
 more
 resilient
 than
 other


sectors,
 and
 the
 flows
 look
 pretty
 good.


Policy
 risk
 is
 still
 a
 big
 overhang,
 but


we've
 had
 some
 developments
 on
 that.
 So


maybe
 investors
 will
 be
 able
 to
 wrap


their
 heads
 around
 that
 a
 little
 bit


better
 than
 they
 have
 in
 the
 past.


>> Lori,
 very
 quickly
 here,
 I'm
 I'm
 curious


what
 your
 process
 is
 as
 we
 get
 into


earning
 season
 in
 in
 earnest.
 And
 I
 know


a
 lot
 of
 that
 uh
 involves
 you
 kind
 of


going
 through
 uh
 call
 transcripts,


looking
 for
 for
 phrases
 that
 stand
 out.


Paul
 asked
 about
 tariffs.
 I
 asked
 about


he
 asked
 about
 valuations
 as
 well.
 What


are
 you
 going
 to
 learn
 from
 those
 calls,


do
 you
 think,
 or
 what
 are
 you
 hoping
 to


learn
 from
 those
 calls
 with
 executives


here
 in
 the
 weeks
 ahead?
 So
 look,
 we
 do


use
 tools
 to,
 you
 know,
 sort
 of
 help


point
 us
 in
 the
 right
 places
 and


earnings
 call
 transcripts,
 but
 a
 lot
 of


that's
 done
 after
 the
 fact.
 My
 team,
 we


like
 to
 read
 top
 to
 bottom
 and
 we
 do


speedread,
 but
 we
 tend
 to
 divide
 up


different
 sectors.
 We
 have
 some


knowledge
 that
 we've
 built
 up
 over
 time


of
 which
 companies
 tend
 to
 be
 more


insightful
 than
 others.
 And
 we
 look
 at


the
 price
 action,
 frankly,
 to
 figure
 out


what
 transcripts
 we
 want
 to
 focus
 on.


Um,
 I'm
 really
 curious
 to
 know
 more


about
 inventories.
 So,
 how
 much


pre-tariff
 inventories
 are
 companies


still
 sitting
 on?
 Another
 thing
 I
 really


want
 to
 understand
 in
 both
 the
 corporate


and
 consumer
 world
 is
 how
 much
 demand


was
 or
 frankly
 was
 not
 pulled
 forward
 uh


from
 the
 back
 half
 of
 the
 year
 into
 the


second
 quarter
 as
 companies
 and
 and


consumers
 were
 trying
 to
 get
 ahead
 of


tariffs.
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 got
 good


indications
 about
 either
 of
 those
 in
 the


last
 reporting
 seasons.
 Companies
 were
 a


bit
 vague.
 Analysts
 frankly
 I
 don't


think
 were
 pushing
 hard
 enough
 to
 get


answers
 to
 those
 questions.
 And
 on
 the


issue
 of
 pull
 forward,
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 said
 they
 also
 just
 they


couldn't
 quite
 tell
 yet.
 So,
 I
 think


those
 are
 some
 of
 my
 big
 questions.
 I'm


also
 curious
 about
 2026.
 So
 far,


companies
 are
 deferring
 uh
 declining
 to


answer
 when
 asked
 about
 2026
 tariff


impacts,
 but
 any
 clues
 we
 can
 get
 there,


I
 think
 are
 going
 to
 be
 helpful.


>> Lori,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 joining
 us.


We
 always
 appreciate

 few

>> Let's
 talk
 about
 the
 residential
 real


estate
 market
 here.
 Selma
 Hep
 joins
 us


here.
 She's
 the
 chief
 economist
 for


Totality.
 Uh
 she
 joins
 us
 here.
 some
 of


the
 I
 the
 big
 issue
 in
 residential
 real


estate
 is
 just
 affordability
 or
 the
 lack


thereof.
 Is
 there
 a
 solution
 to
 this


affordability
 issue?
 I
 think
 about
 the


folks
 in
 their
 late
 20s,
 early
 30s


looking
 to
 buy
 a
 house.
 That's
 tough
 out


there.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 very
 tough.
 Well,
 first
 of


all,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me.
 I'm
 also


happy
 to
 be
 here
 today.
 Um,
 you
 know,


it's
 really
 a
 lot
 it
 is
 right
 now
 about


mortgage
 rates.
 Uh,
 and
 mortgage
 rates


have
 retreated
 from
 recent
 highs.


They're
 now
 averaging
 between
 6
 and
 a


quarter
 and
 6.4
 for
 30-year
 fix.
 And


that
 is
 the
 lowest
 uh
 in
 about
 a
 year,


which
 means
 that
 affordability
 is
 at
 its


best
 now
 that
 it's
 been
 in
 uh
 over
 2
 and


1/2
 years.
 Um
 so
 affordability
 is


improving
 and
 honestly
 in
 some
 markets


uh
 you
 do
 have
 quite
 a
 bit
 relatively


quite
 a
 bit
 more
 affordability
 than
 than


other
 markets.
 So
 in
 Midwest
 for
 example


and
 also
 parts
 of
 uh
 uh
 Northeast
 uh


it's
 it
 is
 clearly
 more
 affordable
 than


markets
 coastal
 markets
 such
 as
 you
 know


New
 York,
 Miami
 and
 LA
 and
 so
 in
 these


markets
 you
 do
 now
 continue
 to
 see


relatively
 stronger
 rate
 of
 home
 price


appreciation
 uh
 despite
 all
 of
 this


affordability
 challenges.
 So,
 you
 know,


markets
 in
 um
 Indianapolis,
 uh
 Chicago,


for
 example,
 uh
 even
 even
 Boise
 City
 at


this
 point
 again
 are
 seeing
 relatively


more
 appreciation
 over
 the
 course
 of


this
 uh
 summer
 uh
 than
 other
 markets


where
 uh
 for
 example
 in
 Florida
 um
 and


markets
 that
 have
 seen
 cumulatively
 so


much
 more
 appreciation
 since
 the
 onset


of
 the
 pandemic
 and
 have
 as
 a
 result


become
 so
 unaffordable
 and
 now
 home


prices
 are
 in
 those
 markets
 are


declining.
 So,
 it
 just
 really
 depends


where
 you
 are
 uh
 in
 the
 country.
 And


>> some
 I
 want
 to
 just
 ask
 you
 another


question
 about
 consumer
 behavior
 here.


Paul
 asking
 about
 20-year-olds
 and


30-year-olds.
 And
 I
 got
 to
 give
 Lisa


Matteo
 credit
 for
 this.
 She
 flagged
 a


piece
 in
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 for
 us


this
 morning
 about
 how
 young
 people
 in


particular
 faced
 with
 these
 higher
 than


we're
 accustomed
 to
 mortgage
 rates
 have


opted
 not
 to
 buy
 uh
 and
 see
 as
 more


promising
 putting
 money
 in
 the
 stock


market
 where
 you
 can
 get,
 you
 know,
 9


10%
 return
 over
 time
 and
 and
 that's
 just


a
 better
 deal
 for
 them
 as
 they
 pursue


renting.
 Is
 is
 that
 bearing
 out
 in
 sort


of
 what
 you
 see
 in
 terms
 of
 consumer


behavior?
 What
 are
 young
 people
 doing
 if


they're
 not
 buying
 homes?
 And
 what's
 it


going
 to
 take
 for
 them
 to
 once
 again


consider
 home
 buying
 to
 be
 so
 integral


to
 our
 notion
 of
 what
 the
 American
 dream


is?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 American
 dream
 is


still
 alive
 and
 well.
 You
 know,
 it's


just
 been
 a
 little
 bit
 postponed.
 Um,


and
 with
 the
 returns
 that
 they're


getting
 in
 the
 stock
 market,
 it
 allows


them
 to
 make
 larger
 down
 payments
 down


the
 road.
 So,
 we
 do
 see
 the
 uh
 median


age
 of
 first-time
 home
 buyer
 be
 higher


than
 it's
 been
 previously.
 Um,
 and
 you


know,
 they're
 now
 tend
 to
 be
 about
 10


years
 older
 when
 they
 buy
 their
 first


home
 than
 they
 used
 to
 be.
 But
 I
 think


survey
 after
 survey
 shows
 that
 again,


American
 driven
 dream
 is
 alive
 and
 well.


Um,
 and
 so
 what
 they're
 doing
 is,
 you


know,
 and
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 can
 uh
 in


many
 ways
 still
 work
 remotely
 or
 don't


have
 to
 go
 to
 offices
 5
 days
 a
 week.
 uh


people
 are
 moving
 to
 areas
 that
 are
 more


affordable.
 Uh
 they
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 in


central
 cities,
 especially
 if
 they
 have


families
 and
 you
 know
 they're
 looking


for
 good
 school
 districts.
 Uh
 you
 know,


they
 tend
 to
 move
 a
 little
 bit
 further


outside
 the
 cities.
 They
 tend
 to
 stay


with
 their
 parents
 for
 longer
 to
 save


for
 down
 payments.
 Uh
 but
 again,
 you


know,
 in
 our
 survey,
 in
 our
 data,
 for


example,
 of
 mortgage
 applications,
 areas


that
 are
 more
 affordable
 in
 Midwest,
 for


example,
 uh
 the
 share
 of
 first-time
 home


buyer
 is
 really
 high.
 it's
 five
 50
 or


60%.
 So,
 you
 know,
 it
 just
 again
 depends


where
 you
 are
 in
 the
 country
 uh
 and


where
 it's
 more
 affordable
 to
 buy,


people
 are
 buying
 and
 younger
 buyers
 are


buying.


>> And
 so,
 here
 again
 in
 the
 uh
 in
 the
 New


York
 metro
 area,
 we're
 dealing
 with
 the


nor
 easter
 here
 today,
 which
 just
 once


again
 highlights


um
 the
 cost
 of
 insurance,
 if
 people
 can


even
 get
 insurance,
 whether
 it's
 for


hurricanes
 or
 fire
 or
 whatever.
 Talk
 to


us
 about
 insurance
 costs.
 I
 mean,
 we've


been
 hearing
 a
 lot
 about
 that
 is
 really


a
 press
 on
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 people.


>> Yeah.
 Insurance
 costs
 have
 been
 a
 big


constraint
 on
 the
 market
 and
 in
 markets


that
 have
 uh
 where
 costs
 have
 gone
 up
 a


lot
 or
 have
 higher
 risk
 of
 natural


disasters,
 you've
 seen
 home
 sales
 being


impacted.
 So,
 in
 those
 markets,
 home


sales
 do
 tend
 to
 fall
 out
 of
 contract


because
 people
 cannot
 get
 insurance.
 Uh


overall
 insurance
 costs
 have
 gone
 up


about
 40
 to
 50%
 again
 in
 some
 markets


significantly
 more
 particularly
 in


Florida
 and
 actually
 parts
 of
 Midwest


where
 you
 don't
 think
 about
 insurance


costs
 being
 high
 but
 they
 are
 because


there's
 persistent
 tornadoes
 for
 example


or
 hail
 um
 and
 so
 not
 big
 natural


disasters
 but
 more
 persistent
 natural


disaster
 that's
 uh
 where
 we
 see
 large


increases
 in
 insurance
 costs.
 Um
 again


it's
 it's
 it
 is
 a
 big
 concern
 but
 you
 do


do
 see
 some
 stabilization
 in
 the
 markets


you
 know
 there's
 been
 regulatory
 changes


in
 markets
 like
 Florida
 and
 and


California
 for
 example
 and
 that's
 helped


improve
 accessibility
 to
 insurance
 but


when
 you
 think
 about
 you
 know
 cost
 in


insurance
 continuing
 to
 go
 up
 uh


forecast
 after
 forecast
 do
 show
 that


those
 costs
 will
 go
 uh
 continue
 to
 go
 up


you
 know
 really
 the
 big
 biggest
 thing
 is


concentration
 of
 um
 residential


valuation
 in
 areas
 that
 are
 have
 high


exposure
 exposure
 to
 natural
 disasters.


>> S
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 lastly
 just
 about
 what


you're
 seeing
 when
 you
 look
 at
 survey


data
 about
 the
 US
 consumer.
 How
 he
 or


she's
 feeling
 about
 the
 economy.
 His
 or


her
 prospects
 going
 going
 forward
 at
 a


moment
 here
 we're
 kind
 of
 struggling


because
 we
 don't
 have
 the
 data
 that


we're
 used
 to
 having
 the
 harder
 data


that
 we're
 used
 to
 having
 because
 of
 the


government
 shutdown.
 From
 your
 surveys


from
 the
 so-called
 softer
 data,
 what
 are


you
 learning
 about
 the
 the
 health
 and


optimism
 of
 the
 US
 consumer
 today?


Well,
 unfortunately,
 especially


unfortunately
 for
 the
 housing
 market,
 uh


consumer
 confidence
 does
 remain
 fragile.


Uh
 you
 know,
 there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 as


you
 said,
 economic
 uncertainty,
 policy


uncertainty.
 Most
 recently,
 what
 seems


to
 uh
 weigh
 on
 consumers
 mind
 is
 job


security
 and
 income
 stability
 versus
 for


example
 uh
 fears
 of
 tariff
 or
 tariffs


earlier
 in
 the
 year.
 The
 other
 thing
 we


do
 see
 is
 again
 bifurcation,
 income


bifurcation.
 So
 uh
 upper
 income


households
 are
 doing
 better.
 Uh
 and
 when


you
 look
 at
 home
 sales
 activity,
 it's


it's
 performing
 better
 uh
 and
 price


stability
 is
 better
 in
 uh
 upper
 income


uh
 or
 upper
 higher
 uh
 higher
 priced
 uh


homes
 than
 lower
 price
 homes.
 So
 again,


it's
 it's
 about
 income
 uh
 and
 it's
 it's


it's
 there's
 regional
 variation,
 but
 I


would
 say
 that
 uh
 consumers
 are
 continue


to
 be
 very
 fragile
 and
 they
 are
 very


responsive
 though
 to
 mortgage
 rate


changes,
 you
 know.
 So
 with
 most
 recent


decline
 in
 mortgage
 rates,
 we've
 seen
 uh


consumers
 are
 coming
 back
 uh
 in
 home


buying
 to
 home
 buying
 market.

 get
 right
 to
 it.
 David
 Maxwell,


managing
 director
 of
 Sustainable


Development
 Capital.
 Uh
 co-manages
 a€


650
 million
 euro
 green
 energy
 solutions


fund
 investing
 in
 energy
 transition
 and


infrastructure
 across
 the
 US,
 Canada,


UK,
 and
 Europe.
 Uh
 David,
 thanks
 so
 much


for
 joining
 us
 here
 in
 studio.
 Braving


the
 Nor
 Easter.
 We
 appreciate
 that.
 Is


this
 administration


supportive
 of
 the
 energy
 transition
 from


your
 perspective
 or
 is
 it
 kind
 of a


headwind
 here?
 What
 what
 are
 you
 guys


figuring
 out
 so
 far?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 good
 question.
 Um
 I
 think


the
 important
 thing
 to
 focus
 on
 is
 the


problem.
 So
 I
 think
 we
 all
 know
 that
 in


the
 United
 States
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a


surge
 in
 electricity
 demand
 um
 driven
 by


the
 AI
 boom
 by
 electrification
 by


onoring
 and
 the
 question
 is
 what
 do
 you


do
 about
 that?
 because
 we
 don't


necessarily
 have
 the
 um
 generation


capacity
 or
 the
 transmission


infrastructure
 to
 meet
 that
 growth
 in


demand.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 that
 um
 the


general
 consensus
 is
 that
 an
 all
 of
 the


above
 approach
 is
 required
 and
 in
 that


context
 um
 certainly
 things
 like


distributed
 generation
 and
 energy


efficiency
 are
 massively
 important
 in


terms
 of
 filling
 the
 gap.
 I
 think
 when


it
 comes
 to
 things
 like
 the
 big


beautiful
 bill
 which
 was
 passed
 on
 July


the
 4th,
 certainly
 there
 are
 going
 to
 be


headwinds,
 some
 headwinds
 associated


with
 utility
 scale
 solar
 and
 electric


vehicles.
 But
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 if
 you


really
 look
 at
 the
 the
 text
 and
 the
 way


that
 the
 uh
 the
 BBB
 has
 been
 discussed,


there
 have
 actually
 been
 lifelines


thrown
 to
 in
 fact
 major
 parts
 of
 the


energy
 transition
 and
 technologies


associated
 with
 it.
 You
 know,
 these


include
 um
 things
 like
 um
 some
 runway


for
 um
 distributed
 um
 solar
 to
 continue


to
 benefit
 from
 investment
 tax
 credits


until
 the
 end
 of
 2027.


You
 know,
 the
 big
 beautiful
 bill


supports
 geothermal.
 It's
 quite
 useful


in
 terms
 of
 batteries,
 um
 hydroelectric


power,
 um
 carbon
 capture
 storage
 and


other
 components.
 So,
 I
 think
 that
 we


just
 have
 to
 take
 a
 pragmatic
 view.
 One


one
 of
 the
 positives
 that
 has
 come
 out


of
 discussions
 and
 we
 recently
 hosted
 an


event
 during
 New
 York
 Climate
 Week
 was


that
 actually
 the
 fact
 that
 this
 has


been
 passed
 and
 that
 there's
 policy


certainty
 is
 a
 very
 positive
 thing
 for


the
 types
 of
 sectors
 that
 we
 invest
 in


and
 certainly
 uncertainty
 is
 unhelpful


and
 so
 actually
 we
 feel
 pretty
 pretty


good
 and
 comfortable
 and
 quite
 bullish


on
 the
 investment
 strategy
 that
 we


deploy
 within
 STCR.


>> I'm
 curious
 how
 much
 you
 and
 investors


can
 tune
 out
 some
 of
 the
 politics


surrounding
 energy
 right
 now.
 So
 I
 think


of
 friends
 who
 live
 in
 Rhode
 Island
 or


Massachusetts
 who
 have
 seen
 such
 great


expenditure
 and
 investment
 in
 wind
 farms


uh
 on
 the
 ocean.
 Now
 we
 see


administration
 taking
 a
 very
 adversarial


approach
 to
 that.
 Obviously
 this
 is


being
 fought
 out
 in
 the
 the
 courts.
 But


when
 you
 look
 again
 at
 that
 level
 of


investment
 and
 put
 it
 in
 the
 crucible
 of


of
 politics,
 is
 it
 your
 sense
 that


cooler
 heads
 will
 prevail
 uh
 enough
 has


been
 built,
 these
 are
 close
 to
 being


finished
 that
 they'll
 they'll
 end
 up


being
 operational
 or
 is
 it
 something


that
 actually
 should
 be
 of
 concern
 to


those
 who
 saw
 the
 prospect
 of
 this
 kind


of
 broader
 based
 uh
 energy
 future
 and


are
 now
 wondering
 if
 we're
 going to
 have


wind
 energy
 and
 and
 other
 types
 of


energy
 going
 forward?


>> Right.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 the
 thing
 to


focus
 on
 and
 I
 think
 what
 will
 prevail


is
 the
 concept
 of
 economic
 imperative.


Uh
 so
 going
 back
 to
 the
 theme,
 there's


going
 to
 be
 an
 explosion
 in
 energy


demand
 in
 the
 United
 States
 and
 there


has
 to
 be
 some
 way
 to
 meet
 that
 growth


in
 demand.
 You
 know,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


kind
 of
 investment
 strategies
 that
 we
 um


deploy
 within
 SDCL,
 they
 focus
 on


downstreams,
 they
 focus
 on
 energy


efficiency,
 where
 where
 the
 energy
 is


consumed,
 how
 it's
 built.
 Um
 and
 those


sorts
 of
 themes
 are
 quite
 in
 some
 ways


immune
 to
 to
 the
 policy
 because
 they


don't
 rely
 on
 policy
 incentives.
 Energy


efficiency
 distributed
 generation
 can


really
 stand
 on
 its
 own
 two
 feet.
 And


certainly
 you
 know
 in
 discussions
 with


some
 of
 the
 CEOs
 that
 we
 do
 business


business
 with
 and
 our
 portfolio


companies
 they
 are
 feeling
 that
 in
 time


to
 come
 and
 not
 very
 long
 in
 sort
 of
 two


or
 three
 years
 post
 27
 that
 these
 types


of
 technologies
 should
 and
 can
 stand
 on


their
 own
 two
 feet.
 Ultimately,
 I
 think


that's
 what's
 going
 to
 drive
 um
 the


energy
 markets
 going
 forward
 and


actually
 you
 can
 see
 that
 there's
 a


confluence
 of
 opinions
 um
 across
 the


pond
 as
 well
 in
 Europe
 and
 Europe.
 Um


>> one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 I
 talking
 to
 your


colleagues
 is
 energy
 efficiency.
 How


much
 energy
 is
 lost
 from
 like
 where
 the


energyy's
 created
 like
 an
 oil
 well
 to


before
 it
 gets
 into
 my
 home.
 I
 mean


energy
 loss
 and
 energy
 efficiency
 is


it's
 a
 huge
 issue.
 How
 do
 you
 guys
 talk


about
 that?
 2/3
 of
 energy
 2/3
 of
 energy


is
 lost


>> from
 the
 point
 of
 extraction
 to
 the


point
 of
 use.


It's
 a
 staggering
 statistic.
 And
 so


that's
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 um
 we


identified
 at
 when
 our
 company
 was


established.
 If
 you
 can
 go
 to
 a


hospital,
 if
 you
 can
 go
 to
 a
 data


center,
 um
 if
 you
 can
 go
 to
 a
 school
 and


you
 can
 save
 them
 energy
 and
 you
 can


reduce
 some
 of
 that
 energy
 wastage
 by


primarily
 two
 things.
 by
 installing


on-site
 generation,
 which
 removes
 all


the
 transmission
 and
 distribution
 losses


associated
 with
 that
 large
 2/3
 energy


loss.
 And
 if
 you
 can
 go
 in
 and
 do


retrofits
 to
 make
 their
 energy
 plant
 and


equipment
 more
 energy
 efficient,
 these


things
 are
 really
 good
 for
 business.


They
 actually
 um
 enhance
 energy
 security


on
 site.
 They
 reduce
 carbon
 emissions.


They
 cut
 costs,
 which
 is
 great
 for


business.
 And
 also,
 it
 represents
 a


fantastic
 investment
 opportunity
 for
 us


and
 for
 the
 investors
 we
 represent.


>> I
 know.
 and
 never
 heard
 that
 decision.


These
 guys
 want
 to
 talk.


>> I
 will
 not
 forget
 that
 either.


>> Yeah.
