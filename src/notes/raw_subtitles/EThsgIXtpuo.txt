Hello
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 September


27th
 and
 this
 is
 Markets
 Weekly.
 Now


this
 past
 week
 the
 equity
 markets
 were


kind
 of
 boring.
 You
 know,
 not
 much
 going


on,
 but
 I
 think
 there
 was
 some
 real


action
 in
 some
 corners
 of
 the
 market.
 In


particular,
 looking
 at
 silver
 absolutely


surging,
 going
 parabolic,
 and
 we've


talked
 about
 silver
 before.
 It
 is
 a
 very


volatile
 metal.
 In
 the
 past,
 we've
 seen


it
 squeeze
 higher
 to
 $50
 in
 the
 1980s


when
 the
 Hunts
 brothers
 were
 trying
 to


corner
 the
 market.
 And
 of
 course
 in
 the


post
 uh
 GFC
 era
 also
 had
 a
 huge
 surge


$50.
 It
 looks
 like
 we're
 going
 to
 try
 to


hit
 that
 again.
 Again,
 before
 there
 was


crypto,
 silver
 was
 basically
 the
 um
 I


guess
 the
 asset
 that
 received
 a
 ton
 of


speculative
 flows
 and
 retail
 interest.


So
 that
 was
 pretty
 interesting.
 Gold
 of


course
 doing
 very
 well
 as
 well.
 Now
 what


kind
 of
 caught
 my
 eye
 the
 past
 week
 and


actually
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 is
 crypto


doesn't
 seem
 to
 be
 trading
 very
 well.


Now,
 some
 people
 think
 about
 crypto
 as,


you
 know,
 levered
 NASDAQ.
 Some
 people


think
 of
 it
 as
 digital
 gold,
 but,
 you


know,
 it's
 it's
 kind
 of
 doing
 much
 worse


than
 than
 gold
 and
 the
 NASDAQ,
 and
 not


sure
 what's
 going
 on
 there,
 but
 it


doesn't
 look
 good.
 So,
 today,
 let's
 talk


about
 three
 things
 because
 we
 do
 have


some
 interesting
 developments
 this
 past


week.
 First
 off,
 let's
 talk
 about
 this


new
 uh
 I
 guess
 line
 of
 thinking
 in
 the


Fed
 where
 we
 have
 kind
 of
 a
 more


coherent
 arguments
 from
 the
 Trump


appointees
 why
 the
 Fed
 should
 be
 cutting


rates.
 And
 secondly,
 uh
 something
 else


that
 happened
 the
 past
 week
 was


seemingly
 the
 Treasury
 is
 going
 to
 throw


a
 lifeline
 to
 help
 save
 Argentina.


Seems
 like
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 some


extension
 of
 the
 Monroe
 Doctrine
 as
 as


the
 president
 seems
 to
 be
 uh
 viewing
 the


world
 in
 that
 way.
 And
 lastly,
 let's


talk
 about
 some
 new
 developments
 in
 the


ongoing
 AI
 bubble
 because
 I
 do
 believe


it
 is
 a
 bubble.
 Okay,
 starting
 with
 the


Fed.
 So,
 this
 past
 week,
 we
 got
 the


first
 speech
 from
 newly
 minted
 Governor


Myron
 and
 also
 a
 couple
 speeches
 from


Governor
 Bowman.
 Now,
 Myin
 and
 Bowman


along
 with
 Governor
 Waller
 are
 Trump


appointees
 and
 they
 have
 been
 pretty


vocal
 for
 lower
 rates
 in
 uh
 in
 the
 past


few
 months.
 So
 when
 you
 think
 about


monetary
 policy,
 there's
 actually
 a
 lot


of
 ways
 you
 can
 think
 about
 it.
 Again,


you
 got
 the
 employment
 mandate,
 you
 got


the
 inflation
 mandate,
 but
 you
 also
 have


uh
 how
 restrictive
 the
 Fed
 is
 currently,


and
 you
 also
 have
 uh
 basically
 how
 the


Fed
 should
 approach
 the
 process
 of
 of


looking
 at
 the
 economy.
 So
 we
 have
 some


interesting
 developments
 both
 from
 Myin


and
 Bowman.
 And
 what
 they're
 trying
 to


argue
 right
 now
 is
 a
 shift
 away
 from


data
 dependence
 and
 towards
 more


forward-looking


uh
 views.
 Basically,
 a
 shift
 back
 to


model
 dependency.
 Now,
 if
 you
 recall
 a


few
 years
 ago,
 the
 Fed
 usually
 is


looking
 at
 the
 world
 with
 a


forward-looking
 stance,
 right?
 They
 have


models
 to
 think
 about,
 you
 know,
 I'm


doing
 this
 monetary
 policy
 acts
 with
 a


lag.
 So,
 how
 is
 the
 economy
 going
 to
 be


affected?
 So,
 that's
 kind
 of
 how
 the
 Fed


used
 to
 operate.
 But
 in
 2021
 and
 2022


based
 on
 that
 framework
 the
 Fed
 was


telling
 everyone
 relax
 inflation
 is


transitory
 we
 don't
 need
 to
 hike
 rates


that
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 a
 total
 disaster.


So
 from
 that
 point
 on
 the
 Fed
 shifted
 to


something
 but
 they
 say
 data
 dependency.


Basically
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 what
 the
 future


is
 going
 to
 be
 like.
 So
 I'm
 just
 going


to
 look
 at
 the
 data
 as
 it
 comes
 in.
 But


of
 course,
 if
 you're
 looking
 at
 the
 data


that
 comes
 in,
 you
 are
 basically
 looking


uh
 in
 the
 in
 the
 past,
 you're
 driving


looking
 at
 the
 um
 rear
 view
 mirror.


Now,
 earlier
 this
 year,
 Cher
 Powell
 was


gave
 a
 speech
 and
 he
 said
 that
 we
 have
 a


lot
 of
 things
 happening
 in
 the
 economy.


President
 Trump
 is
 doing
 all
 sorts
 of


changes
 with
 regulatory
 policy,
 uh
 you


know,
 fiscal
 policy,
 immigration
 policy,


trade
 policy,
 and
 so
 forth.
 And
 I
 just


don't
 know
 what's
 going
 to
 happen.
 So


I'm
 just
 going
 to
 stay
 and
 be
 data


dependent
 in
 a
 sense
 committing
 himself


to
 being
 late.
 So
 that
 was
 what
 he
 was


thinking.
 Now
 new
 what
 now
 Governor
 Myin


and
 Governor
 Bowman
 are
 saying
 is


something
 different.
 They're
 like
 and


Governor
 Bowman
 actually
 says
 this


directly.
 You
 know
 if
 we're
 too


independent
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 looking
 at


the
 back
 rearview
 mirror.
 We're
 going
 to


be
 too
 late.
 So
 let's
 look
 forward
 to


seeing
 how
 the
 world
 is
 going
 to
 evolve.


And
 so
 based
 on
 this,
 they're
 going
 to


they're
 looking
 at
 what's
 happening
 with


the
 policy
 changes
 the
 president
 has
 and


they're
 saying
 that,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 we


should
 be
 cutting
 rates.
 Now,
 first
 from


Governor
 Myron's
 perspective,
 he
 doesn't


actually
 talk
 too
 much
 about
 um
 so
 far


at least
 about
 labor
 and
 inflation
 and


so
 forth,
 his
 focus
 really
 is
 what's


called
 uh
 our
 star,
 the
 neutral
 rate.
 So


his
 argument
 that
 he's
 making
 is
 that,


you
 know,
 the
 neutral
 rate
 is
 actually


pretty
 low.
 And
 because
 it's
 pretty
 low,


rates
 where
 they
 currently
 are
 are
 super


super
 restrictive.
 So
 we
 got
 to
 get


rates
 lower.
 That's
 why
 he
 voted
 for
 350


basis
 point
 cuts
 this
 year.


So
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 an
 angle
 that
 you


don't
 see
 that
 many
 Fed
 officials
 take


because
 the
 neutral
 rate


basically
 the
 rate
 uh
 so
 in
 central
 bank


speak
 if
 interest
 rates
 are
 above
 the


neutral
 rate
 you're
 being
 restrictive


slowing
 the
 economy
 down.
 If
 interest


rates
 are
 below
 the
 neutral
 rate
 you're


being
 accommodative.
 You
 know
 people


don't
 talk
 too
 much
 about
 the
 neutral


rate
 because
 it's
 a
 notoriously
 vague
 uh


thing
 that
 no
 one
 really
 knows
 uh
 where


it
 is.
 And
 so
 Chirpal
 would
 say
 would


know
 it
 by
 its
 works.
 Again,
 just


looking
 at
 the
 economy,
 don't
 want
 to


have
 too
 much
 of
 a
 theoretical
 model.


Now,
 what
 Myin
 is
 saying
 though
 is
 that


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 policy
 changes
 that


Trump
 has
 done,
 it's
 very
 clear
 the


neutral
 rate
 is
 coming
 down
 and
 he
 makes


a
 few
 I
 think
 pretty
 good
 points.
 One
 of


course
 is
 immigration.
 Now,
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 why
 we've
 had
 high
 inflation


over
 the
 past
 few
 years
 is
 that
 we've


had
 tremendous
 tremendous
 population


growth,
 right?
 So
 you
 know
 under
 Biden


there
 has
 tremendous
 amounts
 of
 illegal


immigration.
 No
 one
 knows
 how
 many


millions
 of
 people
 came
 in
 but
 public


sources
 say
 maybe
 two
 or
 three
 million


people
 more
 than
 we
 did
 usually.
 Now,
 a


lot
 of
 people
 coming
 in
 at
 millions
 at
 a


time.
 Obviously,
 we're
 not
 building


houses
 as
 easily,
 as
 quickly,
 right?
 So,


that
 puts
 upward
 pressure
 on
 shelter


inflation.
 And
 this
 is
 something
 people


see
 all
 throughout
 the
 world.
 In
 Canada,


in
 the
 UK,
 in
 Australia,
 they
 have


tremendous
 amounts
 of
 immigration.
 And


rents
 just
 keep
 going
 higher
 and
 higher


uh
 because
 they
 don't
 really
 build
 a
 lot


of
 housing.
 Again,
 everyone
 has
 all


these
 regulations
 that
 limit
 that.
 And


yet,
 you
 have
 people
 who
 need
 to
 live


somewhere.
 And
 that
 pushed
 up
 rent
 a


lot.
 But
 now
 that
 that's
 over
 and
 maybe


we
 have
 some
 deportations,
 shelter


inflations
 would
 come
 down,
 right?
 So


maybe
 that
 means
 that
 we
 don't
 have
 to


be
 as
 restrictive
 as
 it
 used
 to.
 And
 my


also
 makes
 a
 couple
 other
 interesting


points.
 So
 if
 you
 have
 deregulation
 and


again
 everyone
 can
 agree
 that
 President


Trump
 is
 reducing
 regulations
 that


essentially
 decreases
 the
 cost
 of


businesses
 and
 so
 if
 you
 decrease
 the


cost
 of
 businesses
 you
 know
 maybe
 you


have
 a
 higher
 productive
 capacity


increasing
 supply
 again
 that
 puts


downward
 pressure
 on
 the
 neutral
 rate


and
 the
 last
 thing
 that
 he
 suggests
 is


that
 because
 we're
 collecting
 tariffs


maybe
 the
 deficit
 will
 be
 better
 lower


in
 the
 future
 and
 we
 have
 a
 lower


deficit
 government
 is
 not
 competing
 as


much
 for
 resources
 is
 maybe
 that
 means


we
 can
 have
 a
 lower
 neutral
 rate
 as


well.
 So
 he
 makes
 these
 rstar
 arguments.


Now
 again
 these
 are
 pretty
 vague
 and
 I
 I


don't
 know
 if
 anyone
 takes
 them


literally.
 He
 does
 have
 a
 table


decomposing
 it.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think
 it
 is


useful
 to
 look
 at
 these
 big
 policy


changes
 that
 Trump
 is
 doing.
 Again
 these


are
 huge
 changes
 and
 try
 to
 at least


think
 about
 how
 they
 could
 affect
 the


economy
 rather
 than
 just
 being
 data


dependent
 because
 you
 know
 you
 are


driving
 in
 the
 rearview
 mirror.
 Now,


Governor
 Bowman
 this
 past
 week
 also
 made


similar
 arguments
 for
 low
 interest


rates,
 and
 she
 sounded
 a
 little
 bit


panicky.
 Actually,
 she
 doesn't
 talk


about
 the
 neutral
 rate
 at
 all.
 She's
 not


a
 PhD
 economist,
 and
 to
 be
 clear,


neutral
 rate
 stuff
 is
 is
 not
 super


useful
 in
 real
 life,
 but
 she
 seems
 to


pay
 a
 lot
 of
 attention
 to
 the
 labor


market,
 and
 she's
 sounding
 the
 alarm.


The
 labor
 market
 really
 does
 seem
 to
 be


cracking,
 and
 she
 really
 wants
 to
 get


ahead
 of
 it.
 But
 in
 addition
 to
 that,


again,
 if
 you
 follow
 Bowman
 for
 the
 past


few
 years,
 you'll
 know
 that
 she
 is


actually
 by
 nature
 a
 very
 hawkish


person.
 Uh
 she's
 turned
 on
 rates.
 Uh


but
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 other
 stuff,


still
 quite
 hawkish.
 So
 she
 also
 wants


to,
 you
 know,
 sell
 mortgage
 back


securities,
 maybe
 shrink
 the
 Fed's


balance
 sheet,
 maybe
 reduce
 some
 of


these
 emergency
 facilities
 like
 this,


like
 the
 standing
 repo
 facility
 and
 so


forth.
 So
 her
 views
 are
 basically
 things


that
 would
 lead
 to
 a
 curve
 steepening,


lower
 front
 end
 rates
 and
 higher
 longer


rates.
 So
 again
 these
 are
 interesting


developments
 mostly
 from
 my
 perspective


uh
 to
 focus
 on
 being
 more
 uh


forwardlooking
 and
 I'm
 not
 sure
 if


anyone
 else
 is
 going
 to
 come
 along
 to


that
 perspective
 but
 it
 does
 make
 sense


when
 you're
 having
 so
 many
 big
 policy


changes.
 All
 right.
 Uh
 the
 second
 thing


that
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 is
 of
 course


uh
 the
 treasury's
 lifeline
 to
 Argentina.


So
 President
 Malay
 in
 Argentina
 has


really
 done
 revolutionary
 work
 and


Argentina
 has
 been
 a
 country
 that
 is


mismanaged
 for
 some
 time.
 If
 you
 go
 back


a
 hundred
 years,
 Argentina
 was
 one
 of


the
 wealthiest
 countries
 in
 the
 entire


world.
 There's
 a
 saying
 that
 you
 know


you
 can
 be
 as
 wealthy
 as
 an
 Argentinian.


Uh
 however,
 things
 have
 not
 been
 going


well.
 They
 have
 huge
 inflation
 and


economic
 growth
 has
 not
 been
 doing
 well.


So
 Malay
 really
 did
 something
 heroic.
 He


massively
 massively
 slashed
 government


spending.
 Argentina
 actually
 has
 a


fiscal
 surplus
 now.
 And
 that
 seems
 to


have
 brought
 inflation
 down.
 At
 least


for
 Argentinian
 standards,
 it's
 much


much
 lower
 than
 before.
 And
 a
 lot
 of


people
 were
 feeling
 a
 bit
 more
 positive


on
 this
 turn
 in
 Argentina.


However,
 uh
 recently
 Malay's
 party
 seem


to
 have
 not
 done
 very
 well
 in
 a
 local


election
 and
 that
 suggests
 that
 maybe


appetite
 for
 reform
 in
 Argentina
 is


waning.
 Now,


if
 uh
 the
 Malay
 revolution
 is
 just


something
 that's
 going
 to
 end
 very


quickly,
 then
 investors
 are
 thinking


that
 maybe
 they'll
 go
 back
 to
 huge


deficit
 spending
 and
 maybe
 things
 uh


will
 go
 back
 to
 the
 way
 it
 was.
 And
 so,


they
 got
 to
 pull
 money
 out
 and
 so
 you


had
 a
 huge
 run
 on
 the
 currency
 and
 of


course
 the
 bond
 yields
 began
 to
 spike.


Obviously,
 doing
 lots
 of
 austerity
 is


unpopular.
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 totally
 I
 think


predictable
 thing
 that
 would
 happen.


Um,
 however,
 thankfully,
 uh,
 President


Mele
 has
 built
 a
 pretty
 good


relationships
 in
 Washington.
 I
 mean,
 if


you
 watch
 TV,
 you'll
 see
 him
 over
 the


past
 few
 months.
 You
 know,
 every
 now
 and


then
 popping
 up
 into
 events
 that
 are,


you
 know,
 supportive
 of
 uh,
 Republican


party.
 You
 know,
 we
 saw
 him
 hang
 out


with
 Elon
 a
 bit.
 So,
 and
 you
 know,
 it's


actually
 a
 really
 really
 long
 flight


from
 Argentina
 to
 the
 US.
 So,
 he's


definitely
 be
 been
 cultivating
 this


relationship
 and
 today
 it
 seems
 to
 pay


off.
 Now,
 uh,
 Argentina
 had
 already


borrowed
 about
 20
 billion
 from
 the
 IMF.


Uh,
 they
 probably
 have
 trouble
 repaying


that
 and
 trying
 to
 support
 their


currency
 and
 all
 that.
 It's
 been


spending
 their
 foreign
 reserves.
 Over


the
 past
 week,
 Secretary
 Besson
 also


suggested
 that,
 you
 know,
 the
 United


States
 is
 going
 to
 step
 in
 and
 give


Argentina
 maybe
 a
 swap
 line,
 some
 kind


of
 currency
 swap,
 and
 maybe
 even


outright
 buy
 Argentinian
 uh,
 dollar


bonds.
 Now,
 this
 is
 an
 interesting
 thing


because
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 swap
 agreement


is
 not
 going
 to
 come
 from
 the
 Fed,
 but


it's
 going
 to
 come
 from
 the
 Treasury.


The
 Treasury
 itself
 has
 what
 you
 can


think
 of
 as
 a
 rainy
 day
 fund
 called
 the


ESFR,
 exchange
 stabil
 stabilization


fund,
 something
 like
 that.
 Um
 it's


something
 that
 actually
 they
 accumulated


in
 the
 past
 beginning
 when
 uh
 during
 the


gold
 standard
 to
 try
 to
 manage
 the


currency
 but
 more
 recently
 in
 the
 past


decades
 it
 was
 actually
 used
 to
 try
 to


weaken
 the
 dollar
 so
 sell
 dollars
 and


buy
 foreign
 currency
 uh
 when
 the
 dollar


was
 too
 strong.
 So
 that
 the
 ESFR
 has


basically
 been
 ESFR
 has
 basically
 been


you
 know
 kind
 of
 dormant
 for
 for
 some


time
 but
 at
 the
 moment
 when
 you
 when
 I


look
 at
 it
 it
 has
 about
 20
 billion
 in


treasury.
 So
 $20
 billion
 that
 could
 be


used
 to
 to
 at
 the
 treasury's
 discretion


to
 try
 to
 do
 whatever
 they
 want
 with
 it.


And
 it
 looks
 like
 they're
 going
 to
 use


that
 to
 kind
 of
 shore
 up
 the
 Argentinian


uh
 peso.
 Now,
 technically
 speaking,
 I


I'm
 guessing
 that
 they
 could
 have
 forced


the
 Fed
 to
 do
 something
 like
 that
 as


well.
 The
 Fed
 has
 independence
 when
 it


comes
 to
 interest
 rate
 policy,
 so


monetary
 policy.
 Um,
 but
 it
 doesn't
 have


independence
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 regulatory


policy.
 And
 when
 you
 have
 these


international
 diplomatic
 things
 like


this,
 when
 there's
 that
 geopolitical


strategic
 thing,
 uh,
 I'm
 guessing
 they


probably
 could
 have
 maybe
 had
 the
 Fed


give
 them
 a
 line.
 Although
 of
 course
 it


would
 be
 a
 huge
 departure
 uh
 to
 Fed
 to


Fed
 uh
 behavior
 but
 at
 the
 moment


they're
 structuring
 this
 just
 uh
 using


money
 that
 they
 have
 full
 control
 over


and
 to
 give
 to
 Argentina.
 I
 think
 so


broadly
 speaking
 this
 seems
 to
 further


uh
 President
 Trump's
 view
 of


what
 happens
 in
 the
 Americas
 is
 strictly


within
 the
 United
 States's


geostrategical
 region
 and
 they're
 trying


to
 show
 up
 more
 support.
 Now,
 Argentina


actually
 also
 has
 a
 swap
 line
 with
 China


as
 well.


That
 that
 has
 been
 that
 has
 made


President
 Trump
 unhappy
 and
 they
 don't


want
 to
 have
 other
 countries
 come
 in
 and


try
 to,
 you
 know,
 buy
 influence
 by,
 you


know,
 being
 there
 as
 a
 last
 resort.


China
 obviously
 has
 tremendous
 amounts


of
 resources
 they
 could
 lend
 to


Argentina.
 So
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 United


States
 is
 trying
 to
 move
 in,
 shore
 up
 an


ally
 and
 u
 you
 know
 cement
 their


influence
 in
 this
 western
 hemisphere.


And
 you
 can
 also
 see
 President
 Trump


acting
 similarly
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 Brazil


uh
 being
 very
 mean
 to
 uh
 President
 Doula


who
 was
 very
 mean
 to
 President
 Bossoro


who
 was
 the
 president's
 friend
 and
 also


sending
 ships
 over
 to
 Venezuela
 kind
 of


hanging
 out
 and
 you
 know
 it's
 kind
 of


bombing
 uh
 ships
 that
 Sububai
 that
 that


seem
 to
 have
 drugs
 in
 them.
 So
 it
 it


seems
 like
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 a
 broader


broader
 geostrategic
 push
 to
 cement


power
 within
 uh
 the
 Americas.
 So
 it's
 a


kind
 of
 interesting
 development.
 Okay.


The
 last
 thing
 that
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about


is
 of
 course
 the
 ongoing
 AI
 bubble.
 Now,


we've
 talked
 about
 how
 uh
 you
 know,


basically
 all
 these
 companies
 are


spending
 hundreds
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars


to
 build
 out
 AI
 infrastructure
 and
 that


means
 building
 plants,
 spending
 a
 lot
 of


money
 on
 chips
 and
 so
 forth.
 And
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 these
 AI
 so
 far
 isn't


really
 profitable.
 There's
 studies


suggesting
 that
 companies
 are
 trying
 to


use
 them,
 trying
 to
 make
 a
 return,
 but


just
 not
 being
 very
 successful
 at
 it.


And
 open
 AI,
 the
 star
 of
 the
 world,
 has


been
 doing
 interesting
 things.
 Working


with
 Broadcom
 to
 develop
 new
 chips,


promising
 Oracle
 that
 they
 will
 buy
 tens


of
 billions
 of
 dollars
 worth
 of


computing
 capacity.
 Then
 in
 all
 the


stock
 market
 has
 loved
 all
 this
 stuff,


but
 ultimately
 the
 question
 was
 where
 is


OpenAI
 going
 to
 get
 all
 this
 money.


Right
 now
 they
 make
 revenues
 of
 about
 13


billion
 a
 year
 and
 that's
 not
 enough
 to


cover
 their
 costs.
 So
 they
 lose
 money.


For
 the
 Mag
 7
 hyperscalers
 like


Microsoft,
 like
 Facebook,
 they've
 been


financing
 their
 expansion
 through
 their


cash
 flows.
 They're
 still
 very


successful
 companies
 making
 a
 lot
 of


money,
 but
 they've
 been
 plowing
 that


money
 into
 these
 GPUs
 that
 have,
 you


know,
 high
 depreciation
 rates
 and
 don't


seem
 to
 be
 at
 the
 moment
 at least
 being


very
 profitable.
 Actually,
 there's
 a


story
 in
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 the


past
 week
 where
 they
 suggest
 that
 the


gap,
 the
 revenue
 gap
 to
 pay
 back
 all


these
 AI
 investments
 is
 in
 the
 several


hundred
 billion
 category
 and
 there's


really
 no
 indication
 that's
 going
 to
 be


met.
 So
 now
 we
 figured
 out
 the
 past
 week


with
 Nvidia's
 100
 billion
 investment


into
 open
 AI
 where
 the
 money
 is
 going
 to


come
 from.
 So
 this
 idea,
 this
 basically


roundtriping
 thing
 is
 something
 we
 also


saw
 during
 the
 com
 boom.


During
 the
 dotcom
 boom,
 you
 had
 all


these
 big
 fiber
 companies
 laying
 down


fiber
 networks
 throughout
 the
 world


thinking
 that
 the
 internet
 would
 change


the
 world.
 And
 so
 you
 got
 to
 lay
 down


fiber
 and
 eventually
 you
 you're
 going
 to


have
 a
 return
 on
 the
 all
 these


investments.
 Um
 but
 what
 they
 realized


was
 that
 you
 know
 laying
 down
 all
 this


fiber
 the
 demand
 actually
 wasn't
 there


and
 so
 they
 weren't
 really
 making
 money.


So
 what
 they
 ended
 up
 doing
 was
 actually


uh
 buying
 each
 other's
 capacity.
 So
 one


fiber
 company
 would
 buy
 capacity
 from


another
 and
 in
 exchange
 they
 would
 sell


their
 own
 capacity
 to
 the
 other
 company.


So
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 there
 was
 no


cash
 exchange
 but
 then
 they
 would
 report


in
 their
 earnings
 that
 they
 had


tremendous
 amounts
 of
 revenue
 even


though
 at
 was
 basically
 fictional
 right


they
 were
 trying
 to
 one
 company
 is


buying
 stuff
 from
 another
 company
 who


and
 also
 uh
 selling
 this
 their
 own


products
 to
 the
 other
 company.
 And
 this


kind
 of
 reminds
 me
 of
 that
 because
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 Nvidia
 is
 giving
 100


billion
 an
 equity
 investment
 of
 100


billion
 into
 OpenAI
 and
 OpenAI
 is
 then


in
 turn
 buying
 chips
 from
 Nvidia.
 So
 it


seems,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of
 uh
 somewhat


shady,
 but
 the
 market
 did
 love
 it.
 And


things
 like
 this
 can
 go
 on
 much
 longer


than
 anyone
 expects.
 So
 again
 when


you're
 in
 a
 bubble
 things
 go
 on
 can
 go


double
 or
 triple
 but
 one
 day
 and
 you


never
 know
 when
 it
 could
 also
 come


crashing
 down.
 So
 continue
 to
 think
 that


it
 is
 a
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 interesting
 time


and
 also
 I
 think
 also
 a
 risky
 time.
 All


right
 so
 that's
 all
 prepared.
 Thanks
 so


much
 for
 tuning
 in.
 Talk
 to
 you
 guys


next
 week.
