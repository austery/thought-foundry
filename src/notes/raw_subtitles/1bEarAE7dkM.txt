hi
 everybody
 I'm
 Nikolai
 tangan
 the
 CEO


of
 the
 Norwegian
 so
 wealth
 fund
 and


today
 we
 have
 a
 bonus
 episode
 on
 trust


and
 we
 have
 the
 world's
 leading
 expert


on
 trust
 Rachel
 botsman
 here
 with
 me
 uh


she's
 written
 two
 books
 what's
 mine
 is


yours
 and
 who
 can
 you
 trust
 so
 I


absolutely
 love
 the
 work
 you're
 doing
 um


big
 thanks
 for
 for
 being
 here
 thank
 you


it's
 nice
 to
 hear
 on
 a
 bonus
 episode


well
 you
 are
 like
 a
 real
 you
 are
 like
 a


real
 bonus
 so
 let's
 just
 k
 kick
 off
 with


the
 with
 um
 with
 the
 basics
 here
 so
 what


is
 trust
 what
 is
 trust
 um
 it's
 actually


a
 very
 hard
 question
 um
 it's
 a
 word
 we


use
 a
 lot
 but
 when
 you
 ask
 people
 to


Define
 trust
 you'll
 never
 get
 the
 same


answer
 so
 uh
 depending
 on
 the
 field
 some


people
 will
 say
 it's
 an
 asset
 some


people
 describe
 it
 as
 a
 currency
 or
 an


attribute
 um
 some
 people
 might
 say
 it's


a
 value
 but
 trust
 is
 a
 belief
 it's
 a


belief
 towards
 someone
 or
 something
 um


and
 what
 we're
 still
 figuring
 out
 is
 if


the
 way
 we
 trust
 the
 someone
 a
 human
 and


The
 Way
 We
 Trust
 as
 something
 are
 the


same
 thing
 and
 the
 important
 thing
 once


you
 ground
 yourself
 that
 trust
 is
 a


belief
 all
 beliefs
 are
 highly
 subjective


and
 contextual
 and
 it's
 the
 contextual


piece
 around
 trust
 that
 is
 often
 missing


in
 the
 conversation
 so
 you've
 probably


heard
 people
 say
 oh
 I
 don't
 trust
 the


media
 or
 I
 don't
 trust
 this
 politician
 I


don't
 trust
 this
 tech
 company
 it's
 a


completely
 useless
 conversation
 to
 be


having
 because
 whenever
 we
 talk
 about


trust
 we
 should
 follow
 up
 with
 to
 do


what
 what
 is
 it
 we're
 trusting
 someone


or
 something
 to
 do
 what
 is
 it
 we're
 not


trusted
 to
 do
 because
 um
 unwanted
 trust


is
 a
 problem
 why
 is
 trust
 so


important
 um
 so
 it's
 funny
 I
 really


struggle
 answering
 this
 question
 because


um
 there's
 so
 many
 reasons
 so
 I've
 been


studying
 this
 now
 for
 15
 years
 and
 what


I've
 realized
 is
 that
 you
 cannot
 take


risks
 you


cannot
 Venture
 into
 the
 unknown
 you


cannot
 navigate


uncertainty
 without
 trust
 and
 it's


interesting
 because
 when
 I
 first
 started


studying
 trust
 I
 probably
 would
 have


spoken
 more
 about
 the
 social
 glue
 the


collaboration
 those
 components
 um
 but


I've
 realized


actually
 Innovation
 self
 trust
 this


ability
 to
 cope
 with
 uncertainty
 to
 cope


with
 not
 knowing
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 roles
 of
 trust
 today
 so
 that's


why
 I
 put
 the
 emphasis
 there
 why
 does
 it


take
 so
 long
 time
 to
 build
 trust
 um
 well


I
 I
 would
 challenge
 that
 question


because
 um
 most
 people
 have
 a
 natural


propensity
 to
 trust
 okay
 um
 so
 most


people
 will
 go
 into
 a
 situation
 and
 they


won't
 say
 I
 don't
 trust
 you
 they'll
 be


they'll
 wait
 for
 reasons
 signals
 we
 call


them
 trust
 signals
 as
 to
 why
 they


shouldn't
 trust
 that
 person
 okay
 so
 so


the
 default
 is
 to
 trust
 the
 default
 is


to
 trust
 which
 is
 great
 but
 it's


certainly
 very
 quick
 to
 tear
 it
 down


it's
 very
 quick
 to
 tear
 tear
 down
 very


quick
 to
 tear
 down
 um
 so
 there's
 a


difference
 between
 what
 we
 call
 sort
 of


transactional
 trust
 um
 which
 is
 very


easy
 to
 turn
 tear
 down
 and
 relational


trust
 which
 is
 built
 with
 experience


it's
 built
 with
 information
 it's
 built


over
 time
 and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 another


mistake
 many


organizations
 and
 companies
 and
 Brands


they
 think
 about
 trust
 in
 a


transactional
 sense
 and
 what
 they
 don't


think
 enough
 about
 is
 this
 relational


human
 component
 of
 trust
 which
 is


actually
 harder
 to
 tear
 down
 so
 if
 a


product
 fails
 me
 or
 if
 a
 service
 fails


me
 and
 the
 way
 that
 company
 tries
 to


solve
 the
 problem
 is
 transactional
 um


it's
 very
 hard
 to
 trust
 it
 again
 if
 it's


human
 and
 relational
 you
 can
 actually


earn
 trust
 back
 do
 we
 trust


politicians
 to
 do
 what
 I'll
 challenge


you
 with
 that
 question
 question
 run
 the


country
 to
 run
 the
 country
 in
 a
 proper


way
 in
 which
 country
 well
 let's
 start


with
 this
 country
 well
 no
 not
 in
 this


country
 and
 certain
 politicians
 so
 go


back
 to
 context
 now
 just
 for
 the
 just


for
 the
 context
 here
 we
 are
 now
 in
 the


UK
 okay
 we
 are
 in
 the
 UK
 um
 there
 are


certain
 politicians
 I
 trust
 to
 do


certain
 things
 um
 but
 generally
 when
 we


look
 at
 trust
 in
 government
 it
 is
 at
 an


all-time
 low
 um
 when
 we
 why
 why
 is
 it
 um


there's
 a
 whole
 host
 of
 factors
 but
 if


you
 keep
 stripping
 them
 back
 um
 the


central
 problem
 is
 to
 do
 with
 a
 line
 M


that
 people
 no
 longer
 believe
 that
 the


government's
 interests
 align
 with
 their


best
 interests
 and
 that
 actually
 runs


across
 demographics
 it
 runs
 across
 um


education
 income
 class
 so
 it
 could
 be


alignment
 could
 be
 I
 don't
 think
 the


government
 does
 the
 right
 thing
 by
 my


taxes
 to
 all
 the
 way
 through
 to
 I
 don't


think
 the
 government
 does
 the
 right


thing
 for
 education
 or
 my
 Healthcare
 so


when
 you
 have
 a
 misalignment
 problem


um
 is
 the
 deepest
 deepest
 trust
 problem


to
 fix
 when
 will
 you
 get
 it's


interesting
 when
 will
 you
 get
 the


happiness
 schools
 across
 Nations
 so


Finland
 for
 instance
 SCH
 is
 very
 high


one
 of
 the
 real
 differentiator
 there
 is


that
 people
 trust
 the
 system
 right
 they


trust
 the
 politicians
 that
 trust
 the


that
 trust
 there
 is
 very
 that
 there
 is


no
 uh
 corruption
 MH
 why
 so
 why
 is
 trust


so
 important
 for
 happiness
 so
 the
 day
 in


the
 research
 around
 trust
 and
 happiness


um
 I
 mean
 is
 very
 cultural
 I
 should
 say


so
 the
 nordics
 do
 really
 well
 on
 this
 um


part
 of
 a
 big
 component
 of
 trust
 and


happiness
 where
 they
 align
 is
 um


Community
 Collective
 interest
 so
 um
 in


cultures
 that
 become
 not
 just
 hyper


individualistic
 but


narcissistic
 where
 there
 is
 a
 lack
 of


belief
 in
 the
 collective
 social
 good


they
 tend
 to
 be
 lower
 trusting
 cultures


with
 lower
 scores
 of
 Happiness
 so
 one
 of


the
 things
 I
 strongly
 believe
 is
 this


lack
 of
 community
 this
 lack
 of


collective
 interests
 this
 me
 over
 we
 is


damaging
 happiness
 and
 it's
 damaging


trust
 so
 you
 have
 to
 believe
 like
 in


Finland
 like
 in
 Denmark
 that
 these


social
 systems
 they
 serve
 you
 but
 they


also
 create
 a
 greater
 sense
 of
 belonging


to
 something
 bigger
 than
 your
 individual


self
 and
 when
 that
 happens
 you
 generate


trust
 and
 you
 generate
 happiness
 what's


happened
 to
 trust
 over
 time
 so
 where
 are


we
 now
 compared
 to
 let's
 say
 50
 or
 100


years
 ago
 so
 that's
 another
 huge


question
 um
 so
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


has
 been
 a
 thread
 through
 my
 work
 and


why
 I'm
 sort
 of
 still
 studying
 trust
 is


this
 central
 question
 of
 is
 trust
 in
 a


state
 of
 decline
 or
 is
 it
 changing
 so
 is


it
 going
 down
 like
 you
 see
 these
 graphs


or
 is
 it
 pivoting
 and
 what
 I've
 seen
 is


that
 actually
 when
 you
 think
 of
 trust


through
 this
 lens
 you
 start
 to
 see


Society
 in
 these
 shifts
 so
 the
 way
 these


shifts
 map
 at
 the
 highest
 level
 is
 what


I
 describe
 as
 local
 trust
 so
 when
 people


lived
 in
 small
 villages
 and
 communities


and
 it
 was
 largely
 based
 on
 people
 that


you
 knew
 highly
 interpersonal
 trust
 that


trust
 is
 hard
 to
 scale
 so
 we
 invented


institutions
 um
 institutions
 being


physical
 institutions
 um
 mechanisms
 so


things
 like
 contracts
 and
 insurance
 even


Concepts
 things
 like
 trade
 unions
 and


that
 was
 an
 incredible
 period
 of


innovation
 those
 institutional


mechanisms
 technology
 came
 along
 um


particularly
 networks
 and
 platforms


social
 media
 and
 it
 distributed
 trust


now
 we
 are
 not
 through
 that
 phase
 we're


seeing
 the
 chaos
 that
 that's
 causing
 and


we're
 already
 entering
 the
 fourth
 phase


which
 I
 call
 Autos
 Sapient
 trust
 so
 um


the
 isest
 way
 Nicolai
 to
 visualize
 this


is
 actually
 through
 sort
 of
 energy
 flows


so
 if
 you
 imagine
 institutional
 trust


upwards
 trust
 right
 we
 looked
 upwards
 to


experts
 and
 regulators
 and
 referees


distributed
 sideways
 I
 trust
 another


person
 for
 information
 more
 than
 I
 trust


the
 news
 and
 alter
 Sapient
 is
 another


where
 it's
 through
 trust
 we
 won't
 even


be
 able
 to
 make
 this
 distinction
 between


whether
 we're
 trusting
 another
 person
 or


whether
 we're
 trusting
 an
 intelligent


machine
 so
 I
 find
 like
 imagining
 trust


through
 these
 flow
 arrows
 is
 a
 really


powerful
 way
 of
 sort
 of
 getting
 my
 head


around
 all
 kinds
 of
 Dynamics
 and
 changes


happening
 in
 society
 so
 um
 explain
 to
 us


the
 how
 the
 whole
 digital
 space
 and


mobile
 phones
 and
 so
 on
 have
 changed


this
 landscape
 and
 how
 it's
 gone
 from


institutional
 trust
 to
 individual
 trust


some
 examples
 so
 it
 changed
 everything


when
 it
 comes
 to
 trust
 so
 it


fundamentally
 changed
 the
 way
 we
 could


trust
 total
 strangers
 and
 connect
 with


people
 and
 so
 when
 you
 can
 suddenly


think
 very
 differently
 about
 supply
 and


demand
 so
 I
 want
 something
 and
 you
 have


that
 thing
 that
 thing
 might
 be
 a
 piece


of
 information
 it
 might
 be
 a
 skill
 it


might
 be
 time
 it
 might
 be
 love
 it
 might


be
 a
 house
 that
 I
 want
 to
 rent
 and
 we


can
 suddenly
 connect
 and
 facilitate


trust
 through
 that


technology
 you
 change
 the
 flow
 of
 value


you
 change
 the
 flow
 of
 information
 you


change
 the
 flow
 of
 relationships
 and


we've
 seen
 how
 that
 creates
 innovation


so
 everything
 from
 platforms
 like


Alibaba
 and
 eBay
 Uber


Airbnb
 um
 education
 platforms
 um
 we've


seen
 what
 it
 creates
 but
 the
 problem
 is


what
 happens
 when
 things
 go
 wrong
 so
 uh


Airbnb
 you
 trust
 people
 enough
 to
 let


them
 stay
 in
 your
 house
 yes
 but
 not
 when


I'm
 there
 which
 is
 strange
 but
 maybe


that's
 because
 I
 I
 don't
 really
 like
 I
 I


trust
 to
 rent
 out
 my
 home
 when
 I'm
 not


there
 but
 I
 don't
 like
 people
 being


there
 when
 I'm
 home
 right
 which
 is
 kind


of
 weird
 from
 a
 trust
 perspective
 so


it's
 why
 is
 it
 this
 way
 um
 I
 think
 it's


because
 uh
 it's
 not
 actually
 so
 a
 trust


it's
 I
 don't
 really
 like
 strangers
 in
 my


home
 um
 but
 I
 trust
 when
 I'm
 no
 way
 that


they'll
 treat
 it
 with
 respect
 so
 and


I've
 only
 had
 a
 couple
 of
 bad


experiences
 but
 uh
 we
 won't
 go
 into


those
 what
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 with
 AI


when
 are
 we
 going
 to
 start
 trust


machines
 I
 mean
 do
 we
 trust
 machines


is
 another
 huge
 question
 I
 mean
 again


I'd
 say
 trusting
 AI
 to
 do
 what
 right
 so


I
 think
 at
 the
 moment
 the
 way
 most


people
 think
 about
 AI
 is
 a
 tool
 it's


something
 that
 sits
 open
 on
 their
 phone


or
 on
 their
 desktop
 and
 they
 are
 using


it
 for
 information
 so
 they
 have
 a


question
 they
 put
 it
 into
 some
 let's


just
 say
 chat
 GPT
 and
 it
 gives


information
 um
 and
 that
 trust
 leap
 is


happening
 really
 really
 fast
 um
 I
 would


say
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 data
 across


most
 sectors
 um
 they
 don't
 trust
 it
 for


decision
 making
 so
 Finance
 is
 a
 good


example
 right
 so
 I
 trust
 it
 for


information
 but
 to
 actually
 make
 the


final
 decision
 um
 is
 a
 is
 a
 different


trust
 leap
 but
 what
 we're
 seeing
 is
 that


and
 I
 think
 the
 law
 is
 really


interesting
 so
 um
 my
 husband's
 a
 lawyer


and
 he's
 really
 interested
 in
 this
 space


and
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 how
 a
 year
 ago


um
 judges
 said
 you
 know
 lawyers
 cannot


use
 AI
 to
 help
 prepare
 briefs
 and


there's
 been
 a
 360
 turnaround
 on
 that
 in


less
 than
 a
 year
 because
 what
 they're


realizing
 is
 actually
 you
 know
 AI
 can


search
 through
 data
 like
 the
 Panama


papers
 great
 example
 right
 so
 our


initial
 reaction
 when
 something
 comes


along
 there's
 a
 new
 technology


particularly
 in
 high
 stakes
 high
 risk


environments
 is
 to
 say
 no
 to
 reject
 it


to
 not
 trust
 it
 and
 I
 think
 what
 is


really
 interesting
 and
 slightly


frightening
 is
 how
 fast
 those


turnarounds
 are
 happening
 in
 different


sectors
 so
 let's
 talk
 about
 um
 trust
 in


the
 workplace
 working
 from
 home
 yes
 what


are
 the
 issues
 with
 trust
 there
 so
 this


is
 an
 interesting
 one


um
 so
 let
 me
 try
 to
 unpack
 this
 on


different
 levels
 um
 working
 from
 home


can
 bring
 out
 the
 worst
 micromanagement


in
 some
 people
 so
 it
 can
 actually


trigger
 very
 low
 trust
 so
 and
 this
 is
 a


two-way
 thing
 so
 this
 is
 both
 the


employee
 and
 the
 boss
 so
 the
 employee


might
 sit
 there
 going
 um
 I'm
 not
 sure


this
 person
 trust
 me
 because
 when
 there


isn't
 that
 face-to-face
 interaction
 it


creates
 a
 vacuum
 it
 creates
 a
 gap
 and
 we


form
 in
 our
 minds
 a
 narrative
 in
 that


gap
 which
 is
 often
 not
 positive
 right
 so


no
 one
 sits
 there
 going
 oh
 yes
 my
 my


boss
 really
 trusts
 that
 I'm
 working
 all


the
 time
 they
 go
 I've
 got
 to
 demonstrate


that
 I'm
 working
 right
 so
 you
 have
 all


these
 kind
 of
 um
 productivity
 not
 hacks


but
 PE
 performance
 like
 productivity


performance
 we
 call
 it
 so
 people
 needing


to
 demonstrate
 they
 on
 slack
 people


staying
 on
 email
 longer
 that's
 the
 first


problem
 right
 that
 people
 second
 guess


whether
 they're
 trusted
 um
 now
 in
 some


scenarios
 that
 may
 not
 that
 may
 actually


be
 true
 so
 um
 many
 bosses
 and
 leaders


didn't
 grow
 up
 in
 the
 year
 of
 remote


work
 right
 they
 physically
 had
 to
 come


into
 the
 office
 they
 have
 not
 been


taught
 even
 through
 the
 pandemic
 how
 do


you
 manage
 people
 remotely
 how
 do
 you


let
 go
 what
 are
 the
 things
 that
 you
 do


as
 a
 boss
 that
 actually
 can
 be
 perceived


as
 controlling
 by
 the
 other
 person
 so


they
 will
 often
 signal
 things
 that
 they


don't
 trust
 the
 other
 person
 to
 do
 so


there's
 this
 really
 interesting
 tension


that
 goes
 on
 that
 we
 don't
 really
 know


how
 to
 fix
 yet
 the
 second
 thing
 and
 the


data
 is
 just
 coming
 starting
 to
 come


through
 on
 this
 is
 how
 remote
 working
 is


impacting
 interpersonal
 trust
 so
 can
 you


really
 nurture
 trust
 virtually
 in
 the


same
 way
 as
 you
 can
 face
 to
 face
 where


can
 you
 I
 personally
 believe
 no
 because


there
 is
 something
 that
 happens
 when
 two


human
 beings
 so
 we
 could
 do
 this
 through


a
 a
 a
 zoom
 call
 right
 or
 through
 the


screen
 yeah
 we
 wouldn't
 feel
 the
 same


kind
 of
 energy
 I
 couldn't
 read
 you
 in


the
 same
 way
 um
 and
 with
 the
 very
 best


technology
 in
 the
 world
 that
 human


connection
 that
 human
 energy
 when
 you


sit
 down
 with
 someone
 um
 is
 very
 hard
 to


replicate
 virtually
 and
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 worries
 me
 is
 whether
 we're


losing
 this
 skill
 I
 mean
 I
 have
 leaders


tell
 me
 all
 the
 time
 that
 they
 have
 huge


cohorts
 of
 workers
 that
 are
 now


uncomfortable
 sitting
 physically
 in
 a


room
 with
 a
 client
 in
 a
 meeting
 not
 even


in
 a
 contentious
 meeting
 just
 sitting


and
 being
 with
 people
 because
 they're
 so


used
 to
 the
 technology
 being
 the


mediator
 and
 that
 for
 me
 is
 a
 really
 big


worry
 that
 is
 this
 an
 argument
 for
 being


more
 in
 the
 office
 um
 with
 purpose
 so


I'm
 a
 huge
 believer
 in
 hybrid
 working


I'm
 a
 huge
 believer
 in
 different
 types


of
 work
 that
 happen
 at
 home
 and
 in
 the


office
 I'm
 a
 huge
 believer
 in
 how
 it


helps
 with
 inclusion
 especially
 as
 a


woman
 with
 two
 young
 kids
 um
 but
 I
 think


we
 are


underestimating
 how
 we
 are
 losing
 a


skill
 that
 it's
 a
 weird
 thing
 to
 say


that
 people
 are
 uncomfortable
 being
 in
 a


room
 with
 a
 group
 of
 people
 because
 is


they're
 so
 their
 experience
 their
 way


they're
 entering
 the
 workplace
 is
 being


on
 their
 own
 in
 front
 of
 a
 screen


looking
 at
 lots
 of
 people
 well
 there's


more
 social
 angst
 at
 at
 schools
 for


instance
 um
 a
 lot
 of
 absence
 because
 of


it
 I
 see
 it
 now
 on
 planes
 well
 that
 me


maybe
 just
 because
 of
 me
 but
 uh
 people


put
 their
 air
 plugs
 in
 don't
 want
 to


talk
 to
 me
 uh
 has
 this
 anything
 to
 do


with
 trust
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 got


something
 to
 do
 with
 trust
 but
 learning


how
 to
 nurture
 trust
 and
 facil
 itate


trust
 and
 also
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 trust


forms
 in
 moments
 of
 discomfort
 what
 do


you
 mean
 so
 deep
 trust
 forms
 in
 those


moments
 of
 vulnerability
 in
 those


moments
 where
 something's
 got
 gone
 wrong


when
 those
 moments
 where
 you're
 really


listening
 to
 someone
 and
 trying
 to
 solve


a
 problem
 and
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 data
 on


this
 but
 how
 do
 those
 moments
 come
 about


virtually
 where
 you
 really
 have
 to


listen
 and
 show
 up
 for
 that
 person
 um
 so


I
 worry
 that
 we're
 sort
 of
 going
 into


these
 like
 micro
 moments
 of


transactional
 relation
 relationships
 at


work
 but
 these
 moments
 of
 deep
 trust


aren't
 really
 forming
 so
 what
 kind
 of


moments
 are
 are
 these
 I
 mean
 what
 are


the
 key
 moments
 to
 look
 out
 for
 in
 terms


of
 building
 trust
 when
 something's
 gone


wrong
 um
 so
 that
 could
 be
 that
 a
 project


has
 failed
 an
 investment
 has
 gone
 wrong


um
 something
 people
 have
 been
 working
 on


for
 years
 hasn't
 taken
 in
 the
 market
 um


it
 could
 be
 someone's
 received
 a


negative
 piece
 of
 media
 that
 their


reputation's
 under
 attack
 there's
 so


many
 different
 um
 reasons
 and
 causes
 but


it's
 that
 moment
 where
 someone
 feels


exposed
 and
 to
 build
 trust
 then
 what
 do


you
 do
 you
 so
 that
 you
 listen
 to
 them


you
 understand
 them
 I
 mean
 just
 what
 do


you
 do
 well
 the
 first
 thing
 is
 is


actually


identifying
 what
 the
 real
 trust
 issue
 is


for
 that
 person
 so
 often
 when
 there's
 a


trust
 issue
 there's
 something
 that


you're
 losing
 or
 you're
 worried
 about


losing
 um
 and
 whenever
 humans
 think


they're
 going
 to
 lose
 something
 their


instinct
 is
 to
 want
 to
 control
 things


right
 so
 that's
 why
 sometimes
 our
 knee-


reaction
 in
 a
 crisis
 is
 not
 a
 good


reaction
 because
 it's
 that
 feeling
 of


put
 me
 back
 in
 control
 just
 put
 me
 back


in
 control
 and
 so
 how
 you
 help
 that


other
 individual
 identify
 First
 of
 what


is
 the
 real
 trust
 issue
 here
 what
 is


really
 at
 stake
 that's
 actually
 the


first
 step
 because
 your
 interpretation


of
 that
 as
 someone
 emotionally
 removed


from
 the
 situation
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very


different
 from
 the
 individual
 or
 the


leader
 that
 is
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 the


emotional
 crisis
 right
 so
 they're
 in
 the


midst
 of
 the
 heat
 so
 that's
 where
 I


start
 is
 actually
 helping
 them
 identify


what
 the
 real
 issue
 is
 and
 then
 the


secondly
 thing
 they
 need
 to
 they
 need
 to


feel
 seen
 they
 need
 to
 feel
 heard
 and


then
 where
 many
 leaders
 and


organizations
 go
 wrong
 is
 they
 get
 that


listening
 phase
 right
 and
 then
 there
 is


no
 action
 there's
 no
 support
 that


follows
 through
 and
 what
 kind
 of
 action


should
 me
 so
 it's
 it's
 how
 is
 literally


that
 person
 held
 through
 this
 right
 so


what
 kind
 of
 support
 do
 they
 need
 what


kind
 of
 specialist
 support
 do
 they
 need


who
 do
 they
 need
 at
 their
 side
 H
 how


what
 needs
 to
 be
 taken
 away
 from
 them
 um


what
 needs
 to
 be
 given
 to
 them
 um
 so
 the


stakes
 don't
 even
 have
 to
 be
 that
 high


you've
 probably
 sat
 through
 this
 right


where
 you
 go
 through
 a
 performance


review


and
 um
 someone
 collects
 incredible


feedback
 I
 I
 hate
 them
 do
 you
 hate
 them


I
 hate
 them
 because
 I
 have
 had
 some


really
 bad
 ones
 uh
 so
 what's
 the
 worst


thing
 that
 someone
 said
 in
 the


performance
 review
 about
 you
 that
 I
 was


just
 completely
 and
 utterly
 useless
 and


there
 was
 no
 qualification
 well
 there


was
 a
 whole
 long
 list
 of
 things
 I
 had


done
 you
 know
 wrong
 it
 was
 my
 it
 was
 my


first
 job
 I
 mean
 the
 list
 was
 as
 long
 as


a
 you
 know
 a
 roll
 of
 toilet
 paper
 do
 you


remember
 some
 of
 the
 things
 on
 the
 list


oh
 totally
 yeah
 so
 I
 remember
 one
 but
 he


got
 my
 you
 know
 I
 got
 my
 act
 together
 I


kind
 of
 got
 my
 finger
 and
 I've
 worked


hard
 ever
 since
 to
 uh
 prove
 the
 person


wrong
 so
 you
 tried
 to
 prove
 them
 wrong


because
 you
 were
 angry
 or
 you
 just
 no
 no


it's
 just
 like
 I
 realized
 they
 were


right
 I
 had
 been
 pretty
 useless
 and
 I


just
 needed
 to
 you
 know
 to
 speed
 up
 and


uh
 and
 perform
 and
 and
 you
 know
 deliver


stuff
 yeah
 so
 I
 had
 a
 performance
 review


where
 a
 boss
 told
 me
 I
 was
 totally


unemployable
 right
 and
 um
 except
 when


you
 went
 into
 academics
 no
 and
 I
 said


and
 he
 said
 I
 kind
 of
 mean
 that
 as
 a


compliment
 and
 I
 said
 okay
 you
 got
 a


qualify
 that
 right
 I'm
 unemployable
 but


that
 is
 a
 compliment
 and
 um
 it
 actually


led
 to
 a
 really
 interesting
 discussion


which
 is
 that
 you
 know
 my
 natural
 thing


is
 to
 go
 into
 systems
 to
 go
 into


cultures
 and
 to
 see
 where
 they're
 broken


um
 I
 want
 to
 fix
 things
 right
 I
 can
 see


so
 my
 focus
 on
 sort
 of
 this
 was
 when
 I


was
 Consulting
 on
 client
 delivery
 was


secondary
 to
 wanting
 to
 fix
 the
 company


right
 was
 but
 anyway
 um
 but
 then
 he


didn't
 do
 anything
 with
 it
 right
 like
 so


I
 I'm
 now
 sitting
 there
 thinking
 I'm


unemployable
 I'm
 unemployable
 what
 am
 I


doing
 in
 this
 organization
 like
 that's


that's
 an
 example
 of
 like
 feedback
 with


no
 catch
 right
 no
 support
 no
 follow


through
 yeah
 I
 am
 unemployable
 so
 he
 was


right
 as
 well
 so
 but
 well
 using


eminently
 employable
 to
 me
 but
 just
 um
 a


bit
 more
 on
 um
 working
 from
 home
 and
 so


on
 so
 digital
 productivity
 tracking


tools
 like
 they
 use
 it's
 terrible
 right


so
 they
 use
 that
 in
 in
 some
 countries


we're
 not
 really
 you
 know
 quite
 rightly


so
 and
 don't
 use
 them
 um
 uh
 in
 our


company
 but
 what
 what
 do
 they
 do
 to


people
 they're
 awful
 I
 mean
 first
 of
 all


I
 think
 if
 you're
 a
 company
 that
 has
 I


mean
 and
 there's
 a
 spectrum
 right
 so


there's
 some
 companies
 that
 are
 tracking


your
 time
 online
 right
 um
 there's
 some


companies
 that
 goes
 to
 the
 extrem
 of


video
 cameras
 so
 they're
 filming
 what


people
 are
 doing
 um
 others
 that
 are


monitoring
 everything
 that
 people
 look


at
 I
 mean
 these
 are
 all
 incredible


signals
 of
 low
 trust
 um
 and
 it's


surveillance
 it's
 surveillance
 it's
 not


monitoring
 it
 is
 surveillance
 right
 so


you
 know
 um
 one
 of
 the
 things
 though
 I


have
 an
 issue
 with
 is
 what
 are
 you


actually
 measuring
 because
 you're
 not


really
 measuring
 value
 you're
 not
 really


measuring
 productivity
 you're
 just


measuring
 how
 people
 physically
 show
 up


yeah
 and
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 worst
 ways


to
 Value
 human
 beings
 it's
 the
 worst


ways
 to
 get
 quality
 of
 work
 out
 of


people
 you're
 just
 basically
 going
 back


to
 factory
 days
 where
 people
 are


clocking
 in
 and
 clocking
 out
 so
 um
 look


it's
 it's
 a
 huge
 challenge
 for


organizations
 I
 have
 a
 huge
 amount
 of


empathy
 when
 you
 are
 trying
 to
 manage


tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 people
 that
 are


working
 remotely
 that
 aren't
 necessarily


engaged
 that
 don't
 necessarily
 care


about
 their
 jobs
 how
 do
 you
 monitor


those
 people
 I
 would
 say
 if
 you
 have
 to


implement
 any
 kind
 of
 surveillance


system
 you've
 got
 a
 culture
 problem


which
 stems
 from
 a
 lack
 of
 trust
 what


does
 it
 do
 to
 bring
 laptop
 into
 meetings


uh
 that's
 an
 interesting
 question
 um
 it


depends
 so
 you
 know
 when
 you
 sit
 in


those
 meetings
 and
 everyone
 has
 a
 laptop


and
 then


everyone
 is
 typing
 on
 that
 laptop
 and


there's
 some
 meetings
 where
 you
 know


people
 are
 actually
 taking
 notes
 because


they're
 looking
 up
 they're
 looking
 like


they're
 still
 engaged
 in
 the
 meeting
 and


they're
 using
 that
 laptop
 as
 a
 tool


within
 that
 meeting
 M
 but
 when
 people


are
 there
 and
 they're
 not
 there
 what's


the
 point
 of
 having
 the
 meeting
 um
 I


mean
 I
 think
 the
 laptops
 are
 worse
 than


the
 phones
 in
 that
 sense
 um
 I
 think


there
 is
 I
 I
 sometimes
 sit
 with
 people


and
 I
 literally
 want
 to
 grab
 the
 phone


out
 of
 their
 hand
 and
 throw
 it
 out
 the


window
 because
 I
 don't
 think
 people


realize
 that
 they're
 being
 rude
 I
 I


really
 don't
 think
 they
 realize
 that


they're
 signaling
 that
 you
 are
 not
 as


important
 as
 the
 thing
 that's
 in
 their


hand
 and
 you've
 probably
 had
 this


situation
 right
 where
 you're
 talking
 to


someone
 and
 then
 they
 look
 down
 and
 they


start
 swiping
 they're
 not
 even
 typing


right
 and
 what
 they're
 saying
 is
 you're


boring
 you're
 not
 important
 I've


disengaged
 well
 true
 love
 is
 to
 be
 with


somebody
 without
 looking
 at
 your
 phone


well
 TR
 yes


true
 um
 now
 I
 have
 a
 I
 have
 a
 a
 slogan


which
 is
 that
 speed
 is
 a
 mindset
 and
 I


think
 speed
 is
 very
 important
 now
 so


what
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 that
 uh
 that's
 that


you
 can
 do
 pretty
 much
 everything
 twice


as
 fast
 as
 as


uh
 as
 you
 had
 planned
 or
 uh
 speed
 in


organization
 how
 quickly
 you
 pick
 up
 the


phone
 how
 quickly
 you
 answer
 an
 email
 uh


and
 I
 think
 it's
 interesting
 the
 quicker


you
 do
 things
 the
 more
 time
 you
 save
 if


I
 answer
 an
 email
 within
 one
 minute
 yes


it
 can
 be
 one
 sentence
 yes
 if
 it
 takes


an
 hour
 it
 needs
 to
 be
 a
 paragraph
 and


if
 it's
 a
 day
 it
 needs
 to
 be
 a
 page


agreed
 so
 you
 save
 time
 by
 being
 quick


responsive
 absolutely
 now
 I
 read
 that


you
 say
 somewhere
 that
 speed
 is
 the


enemy
 of
 trust
 yes
 what
 is
 that
 so
 I


would
 argue
 I
 think
 what
 you're
 talking


about
 there
 is
 responsiveness
 versus
 so


you
 you
 you
 may
 respond
 quickly
 to


emails
 um
 because
 what
 you're
 saying
 is


in
 the
 Gap
 the
 person
 is
 wondering
 what


you're
 thinking
 right
 so
 you
 then
 why
 do


you
 just
 explain
 to
 me
 why
 you
 think


it's
 a
 sentence
 versus
 a
 paragraph
 well


because
 you'd
 be
 impressed
 by
 you'd
 be


impressed
 by
 how
 quick
 how
 quickly
 I


answer
 so
 I
 don't
 need
 to
 impress
 you
 by


what
 I
 say
 interesting
 okay
 but
 how


thoughtful
 you
 thoughtful
 are
 you
 in
 the


one
 sentence
 answer
 always
 of
 course


very
 thoughtful
 always
 thought
 right
 so


if
 you
 rush
 that
 there
 would
 be
 a


problem
 sure
 okay
 so
 there's
 a


difference
 in
 sort
 of
 how
 quickly
 you


respond
 to
 people
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that's


bad
 for
 trust
 what
 I'm
 saying
 is
 when


people
 don't
 slow
 down
 and
 they
 don't


think
 about
 the
 information
 that
 they're


sharing
 so
 you
 know
 sometimes
 someone


sends
 you
 an
 article
 and
 you
 know
 they


have
 not
 read
 that
 article
 but
 this


happens
 to
 me
 all
 the
 time
 I
 think
 will


be
 really
 useful
 to
 you
 and
 you
 dig
 in


and
 you're
 like
 this
 is
 rubbish
 right


because
 they
 they've
 seen
 the
 headline


they've
 seen
 where
 it's
 being
 written


that's
 an
 example
 of
 speed
 being
 the


enemy
 of
 trust
 um
 when
 you
 give
 your


information
 away
 too
 quickly
 so
 guilty


because
 sometimes
 I
 want
 the
 thing
 but


you
 know
 when
 you're
 just
 like
 accept
 or


reject
 and
 I
 try
 to
 go
 to
 press
 reject


sometimes
 and
 then
 I
 get
 caught
 in
 a


loop
 so
 I
 just
 accept
 it
 because
 I
 want


to
 get
 to
 the
 thing
 right
 I'm
 really


annoyed
 by
 the
 friction
 um
 banking
 um


you
 know
 when
 you
 get
 those
 texts
 and


it's
 like
 um
 UPS
 cannot
 deliver
 your


package
 please
 click
 here
 and
 you
 just


want
 to
 you
 want
 the
 package
 so
 you


click
 there
 and
 you've
 suddenly
 given


your
 credit
 card
 details
 to
 a
 scam
 right


when
 you're
 not
 slowing
 down
 when
 there


is
 no
 friction
 in
 those
 experiences
 what


I
 call
 a
 trust
 pause
 that's
 really


damaging
 for
 trust
 because
 you're
 giving


your
 trust
 away
 too
 easily
 and
 this
 is
 a


huge
 problem
 because
 what
 technology


wants
 to
 do
 is
 remove
 that
 friction


right
 you
 speak
 to
 most
 entrepreneurs


you
 talk
 to
 experience
 designers
 what


they
 trying
 to
 do
 make
 things
 efficient


make
 them
 quick
 make
 them
 seamless
 well


if
 everything
 is


frictionless
 our
 tolerance
 for
 friction


goes
 down
 now
 I
 see
 this
 all
 the
 time


right
 you
 know
 um
 self-service
 checkouts


in
 the
 supermarket
 terrible
 design
 right


like
 CU
 every
 three
 things
 you
 hit
 the


person
 is
 coming
 to
 help
 you
 right
 now


so
 this
 is
 just
 an
 example
 I
 was
 in
 the


supermarket
 the
 other
 day
 and
 this
 guy


is
 like
 shouting
 at
 the
 machine
 right


and
 then
 he's
 Bang
 the
 machine
 because


he
 can't
 check
 out
 and
 I'm
 like
 dude


you're
 trying
 to
 buy
 an
 11
 liter
 bottle


of
 vodka
 whatever
 it
 is
 right
 someone


has
 to
 say
 that
 you're
 old
 enough
 to
 buy


it
 hitting
 the
 machine
 is
 not
 going
 to


help
 he's
 like
 I
 I
 got
 to
 get
 out
 of


here
 I'm
 why
 is
 this
 a
 self-service


checkout
 it's
 just
 one
 example
 we
 see


all
 the
 time
 like
 we
 have
 no
 patience


for
 any
 kind
 of
 friction
 because


everything
 has
 become
 so
 on
 demand
 so


quick
 and
 so
 when
 we
 are
 slowed
 down
 we


don't
 like
 it
 but
 slowing
 down
 helps
 us


think
 about
 is
 this
 person
 is
 this


product
 is
 this
 piece
 of
 information
 is


this
 money
 I'm
 going
 to
 send
 is
 it


actually
 worthy
 of
 my
 trust
 and
 what's


the
 relationship
 between
 empathy
 and


Trust
 so
 empathy
 is
 huge
 so
 when
 we
 look


at
 um
 trustworthiness
 um
 the
 behavioral


side
 of
 trust
 um
 we
 talk
 about
 someone's


capability
 and
 someone's


character
 and
 on
 the
 character
 side
 um


social
 sciences
 have
 been
 studying
 for


over
 50
 years
 why
 do
 you
 trust
 certain


people
 why
 do
 you
 give
 them
 their
 trust


and
 on
 the
 character
 side
 there
 are
 two


high
 order
 traits
 the
 first
 is
 integrity


and
 the
 second
 is
 empathy
 they
 carry


equal
 import
 well
 actually
 they
 don't


carry
 equal
 importance
 it
 depends
 on
 the


situation
 so
 if
 you
 are
 a
 teacher
 you


need
 very
 high
 empathy
 um
 if
 you're
 a


lawyer
 you
 need
 very
 high
 integrity
 um


and
 then
 on
 the
 capability
 side
 we
 have


reliability
 and


competence
 and
 it's
 interesting
 because


you
 need
 different
 amounts
 of
 these


traits
 in
 different
 situations
 but


empathy
 is
 interesting
 so
 when
 you
 say


to
 leaders
 why
 do
 why
 do
 you
 think


empathy
 is
 important
 they'll
 say
 well
 I


think
 it's
 because
 it
 shows
 people
 that


I'm
 a
 good
 listener
 this
 why
 here
 or
 um


I
 think
 it
 demonstrates
 that
 I
 care
 and


what's
 really
 interesting
 is
 that
 the


most
 empathetic
 leaders
 often
 score
 very


high
 on
 curiosity
 h
 and
 I
 find
 this


fascinating
 so
 why
 why
 is
 there
 a


relationship
 there
 because
 they
 ask


questions
 mhm
 what
 you
 have
 to
 say
 is


interesting
 to
 them
 what
 you
 think
 is


important
 to
 them
 they're
 open
 to


difference
 they're
 open
 to
 disagreement


so
 I
 think
 empathy
 and
 this
 is
 just
 my


opinion
 has
 sort
 of
 been


rebranded
 in
 a
 way
 that
 isn't
 helpful
 so


if
 you're
 a
 leader
 and
 you
 think
 of


empathy
 I've
 got
 to
 demonstrate
 I
 can


hear
 and
 listen
 to
 thousands
 of
 people


that
 I'm
 in
 their
 shoes
 that's
 what


empathy
 that's
 really
 hard
 to
 scale
 if


as
 a
 leader
 you
 have
 to
 demonstrate
 that


you
 are
 curious
 that
 you're
 generally


interested
 in
 people's
 stories
 where


they've
 come
 from
 why
 they're
 working


from
 you
 what
 they
 want
 to
 achieve
 how


they
 want
 to
 impact
 the
 company
 what


they
 think
 that's
 I
 think
 much
 easier
 to


sort
 of
 emulate
 the
 empathy
 so
 if
 people


perceive
 you
 as
 curious
 they
 also
 think


that
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 EMP


yeah
 it's
 a
 sign
 that
 you
 care
 they
 and


they
 trust
 you
 more
 yeah
 because
 you're


saying
 you're
 important
 to
 me
 what
 you


have
 to
 say
 is
 I
 mean
 you're
 you're
 a


curious
 person
 is
 this
 something
 that


you
 try
 to
 do
 with
 people
 is
 just
 ask


them
 questions
 where
 they
 go
 I
 haven't


heard
 that
 before
 I've
 never
 been
 asked


that
 before
 like
 those
 are
 actually
 ways


of
 signaling
 empathy
 that
 you're
 there


you're
 present
 you're
 interested
 in
 that


person
 why
 is
 consistency
 important
 you


write
 that
 in
 a
 in
 a
 recent


newsletter
 so
 um
 it's
 a
 we
 read
 Atomic


habits
 yeah
 so
 there's
 a
 line
 in
 there


um
 by
 James
 CLE
 where
 he
 says
 um


intensity
 makes
 a
 great
 story
 but
 it's


consistency
 that
 leads
 to
 progress
 now


he's
 talking
 about
 that
 in
 the
 context


of
 habits
 but
 he
 could
 be
 writing
 about


trust
 so
 leaders
 not
 just
 leaders
 people


who
 show
 up
 in
 a
 big
 intense
 way
 so
 this


could
 be
 in
 a
 family
 situation
 right
 so


you
 know
 the
 relative
 that
 never
 picks


up
 the
 phone
 you
 can't
 rely
 on
 them
 but


they
 show
 up
 for
 Christmas
 with
 the
 big


gift
 right
 that's
 intensity
 or
 the


leader
 that
 is
 often
 late
 is
 really


unpredictable
 their
 energy
 changes
 all


the
 time
 but
 give
 them
 a
 Leadership


Summit
 and
 they
 are
 they
 are
 there
 right


they're
 going
 to
 show
 up
 that's


intensity
 but
 where
 real
 trust
 forms
 is


the
 person
 the
 friend
 the
 grandparent


whoever
 it
 may
 be
 who
 shows
 up


consistently
 that
 remembers
 the
 small


things
 that
 you
 said
 six
 months
 ago
 that


were
 important
 to
 them
 so
 what
 I
 want
 to


what
 people
 often
 conflate
 with
 this


idea
 is
 you
 can
 be
 an
 intense
 person
 and


you
 can
 be
 consistent
 you
 can
 have
 bad


days
 and
 you
 can
 have
 good
 days
 you
 can


have
 high
 striz
 days
 where
 you
 achieve


loads
 of
 things
 and
 low
 stri
 days
 where


you
 get
 nothing
 done
 you
 can
 still
 be


consistent
 in
 the
 way
 you
 show
 up
 for


people
 so
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 consistency
 is


people
 know
 what
 to
 expect
 of
 you
 they


know
 what
 the
 experience
 of
 you
 is
 going


to
 be
 and
 it's
 those
 inconsistent


leaders
 family
 members
 friends
 we
 like
 I


just
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 is
 this
 person


going
 to
 show
 up
 how
 they
 going
 to
 react


how
 are
 they
 going
 to
 respond
 are
 they


going
 to
 show
 up
 that
 really
 damages


trust
 when
 things
 go
 wrong
 when
 we
 make


mistakes
 what
 does
 that
 do
 to
 trust
 so


what
 kind
 of
 mistakes
 you
 think
 you
 have


when
 you
 ask
 that
 question
 uh
 well
 it


could
 be
 all
 kinds
 of
 things
 um
 well
 let


I
 know
 I'm
 a
 CEO
 I
 made
 a
 big
 mistake
 I


admitted
 in
 front
 of
 the
 whole


organization
 so
 I
 think
 if
 you
 if
 there


is
 an


admission
 and
 then
 tied
 to
 that


admission
 there
 is


accountability
 um
 because
 sometimes


leaders
 can
 admit
 mistakes
 but
 they


don't
 actually
 own
 the
 mistake


afterwards
 right
 so
 um
 I'm
 responsible


I'm
 accountable
 and
 then
 really


important
 this
 is
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 do


to
 change
 this
 so
 accountability
 to


fixed
 trust
 has
 to
 move
 to
 change
 an


action
 um
 and
 where
 many
 companies
 make


the
 mistake
 and
 we
 don't
 I'm
 so
 but
 if


you
 so
 if
 you
 do
 that
 do
 people
 trust


you
 more
 or
 less
 they
 can
 trust
 you
 more


so
 it
 can
 actually
 have
 a
 positive


effect
 on
 trust
 yeah
 um
 now
 where
 it


backfires
 is
 it
 can
 be
 a
 leader
 it
 can


be
 an
 entire


company
 uh
 it
 can
 be
 a
 small
 trust


breach
 or
 a
 massive
 crisis
 and
 we
 we
 see


this
 all
 the
 time
 they
 point
 to
 the


system
 so
 um
 oh
 it
 had
 nothing
 to
 do


with
 me
 or
 any
 individuals
 it
 was
 the


algorithm
 or
 it
 was
 a
 product
 failure
 or


something
 happened
 to
 the
 data
 and
 you


see
 companies
 go
 through
 this
 right


whether
 it's
 Boeing
 whether
 it's


Facebook
 meta
 right
 it's
 very
 hard
 for


those
 companies
 to
 recover
 from
 those


trust
 crises
 until
 there
 is


accountability
 in
 the
 character
 side
 of


trust
 not
 the
 capability
 side
 of
 trust


so
 it's
 not
 we're
 going
 to
 fix
 the


product
 we're
 going
 to
 fix
 the
 system


we're
 going
 to
 fix
 the
 algorithm
 it's


what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 do
 in
 the
 culture


particularly
 around
 the
 Integrity
 piece


that
 ensures
 me
 this
 isn't
 going
 to


happen
 again
 and
 it
 amazes
 me
 how
 long


it
 can
 take
 companies
 to
 arrive
 at
 that


point
 of
 saying
 you
 know
 what
 this


wasn't
 just
 a
 capability
 issue
 actually


there's
 something
 in
 the
 culture
 and
 the


character
 of
 the
 way
 we're
 measured
 the


way
 we're
 incentivized
 the
 way
 you
 know


we're
 held
 accountable
 to
 each
 other
 our


reporting
 structures
 regulation
 whatever


it
 might
 be
 the
 problem
 lies
 there
 not


in
 the
 product
 or
 the
 service
 or
 the


system
 moving
 on
 to
 the
 the
 fund
 where


where
 I
 work
 um
 now
 we
 run
 capital
 on


behalf
 of
 the
 whole
 Norwegian
 population


what
 do
 you
 think
 is
 the
 key
 to
 build


trust
 well
 let
 me
 let
 me
 turn
 the
 ti


tables
 on
 you
 because
 I
 have
 an
 answer


but
 I'm
 intrigued
 in
 your
 because
 you


must
 spend
 time
 thinking
 about
 this


questione
 responsibility
 right
 and
 I


would
 argue
 it's
 probably
 the
 thing
 you


think
 about
 or
 should
 think
 about
 the


most
 right
 what
 do
 you
 think
 is
 the
 most


important
 thing
 well
 I
 think
 it
 is
 to


build
 knowledge
 because
 about
 the
 fund


and
 what
 we
 do
 because
 what
 we
 see
 is


that
 people
 who
 know
 about
 the
 fund
 they


trust
 us


more
 um
 we
 even
 see
 that
 the
 people
 who


listen
 to
 our
 podcast
 trust
 the
 fund


more
 than
 the
 people
 who
 don't
 listen
 to


the
 podcast
 MH
 um
 when
 we
 see
 various


age
 groups
 and
 so
 on
 it's
 just


consistent
 that
 knowledge
 builds
 trust


yes
 uh
 we
 need
 to
 be
 consistent
 we
 need


to
 be
 uh
 we
 need
 to
 do
 things
 according


to
 our
 mandate
 uh
 and
 we
 need
 to


communicate
 correctly
 and
 of
 course
 we


need
 to
 behave
 you
 know
 we
 need
 to
 do


the
 right
 things
 so
 the
 way
 I
 hear
 that


is
 the
 first
 thing
 that
 you're
 talking


about
 is
 familiarity
 yeah
 so
 um
 we
 tend


to
 trust
 things
 that
 we
 are
 more


familiar
 with
 um
 and
 that
 can
 be
 because


what
 you're
 doing
 is
 you're
 taking


something
 that
 is
 unknown
 and
 you're


making
 it
 known
 to
 people
 so
 that's
 the


first
 step
 um
 the
 second
 thing
 that


you're
 talking
 about
 I
 think
 is
 openness


so
 you're
 not
 talking
 about
 transparency


what
 you're
 talking
 about
 is
 funds
 are


often
 well
 it
 is
 also
 transparency


because
 we
 are
 the
 most
 transparent
 Fund


in
 the
 world
 in
 what
 sense
 that
 we
 make


information
 available
 to
 everybody
 that


we
 are
 uh
 that
 we
 tell
 everybody
 how
 we


are
 voting
 at
 various
 uh
 annual
 meetings


the
 these
 kind
 of
 things
 okay
 let's
 come


back
 to
 that
 CU
 it
 be
 interested
 in
 if


if
 there's
 anything
 you
 can't
 tell


people
 if
 you
 don't
 tell
 people
 and
 they


want
 to
 know
 but
 let's
 come
 back
 to
 that


and
 I
 would
 say
 the
 behavioral
 piece


that
 you're
 talking
 about
 is
 the


Integrity
 piece
 so
 I
 would
 say
 and
 this


goes
 with
 the
 openness
 piece
 the
 thing


with
 funds
 is
 that
 99.9%
 of
 people
 don't


know
 how
 they
 work
 right
 they're
 these


mysterious
 things
 that
 are
 run
 by


powerful
 wealthy
 people
 how
 do
 they
 make


money
 but
 more
 importantly
 how
 does
 that


money
 serve
 me
 so
 this
 gets
 back
 to


where
 we
 began
 right
 with
 politicians


and
 government
 like
 how
 do
 the
 funds


interest


align
 with
 the
 citizens
 of
 Norway
 right


not
 the
 wealthy
 and
 the
 elite
 but
 the


average
 person
 that
 they
 believe
 that
 in


some
 way
 the
 fund
 is
 benefiting
 their


life
 and
 it's
 a
 mistake
 we
 also
 we
 don't


tell
 those
 stories
 right
 so
 we
 tell
 the


stories
 of
 growth
 um
 we
 tell
 the
 stories


of
 how
 well
 we're
 managing
 the
 wealth


but
 how
 that
 wealth
 is
 positively


impacting
 people's
 lives
 what
 it
 unlocks


what
 it
 enables
 Norway
 to
 do
 how
 that


impacts
 my
 life
 for
 the
 better
 that's


the
 piece
 that
 often
 gets
 missed
 in
 the


trust
 story
 so
 um
 the
 people
 on
 the


inside
 they
 will
 talk
 about
 performance


right
 so
 the
 fund
 is
 performing
 really


well
 and
 therefore
 we
 should
 be
 trusted


but
 those
 percentage
 points
 points
 those


increases
 they
 don't
 mean
 anything
 to


the
 average
 person
 so
 the
 trust
 bridge


is
 The
 Narrative
 of
 what's
 in
 it
 for
 me


how
 does
 this
 benefit
 me
 talking
 which


we
 have
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 young


people
 listening
 to
 this
 podcast
 what


should
 they
 do
 so
 that
 people
 trust
 them


more
 when
 they're
 joining
 a
 new
 job
 or


and
 and
 in
 any
 situation
 what's
 the
 key


you
 are
 20
 years
 old
 and
 you're
 thinking


about
 your
 career
 and
 your
 life
 how
 do


you
 build
 that
 trust
 that's
 trust


Capital
 interesting
 um
 so
 I
 would
 say


early
 on
 in
 your
 career
 um
 you're
 trying


to


demonstrate
 your
 capability
 on
 equal


footing
 with
 your
 character
 your


capability
 is
 what's
 going
 to
 get
 you
 an


interview
 your
 character
 is
 what's
 going


to
 get
 you
 the
 job
 and
 what
 you
 see


often
 and
 this
 isn't
 just
 the
 fault
 of


young
 people
 it's
 the
 people


interviewing
 them
 um
 it
 becomes
 about


their
 experience
 what
 they're
 qualified


to
 do
 and
 both
 sides
 often
 don't


communicate
 their
 interests
 their


motives
 their
 intentions
 why
 do
 they


really
 want
 that


position
 um
 and
 so
 I
 think
 in
 an


interview
 situation
 um
 when
 you're


trying
 to
 demonstrate
 who
 you
 are
 and


what
 you
 can
 bring
 thinking
 about
 that


capability
 side
 and
 thinking
 about
 that


character
 side
 is
 really
 important
 and


then
 in
 the
 early
 stages
 of
 your
 career


um


I
 honestly
 think
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 traits
 is


reliability
 it's
 how
 you
 show
 up
 and


behave
 over
 time
 and
 you
 talk
 to
 leaders


um
 and
 this
 is
 anecdotal
 and
 managers


and
 they'll
 say
 their
 pet
 peeve
 is


inconsistency
 right
 like
 oh
 I
 don't
 know


if
 I
 can
 trust
 them
 that
 they're
 going


to
 get
 this
 thing
 done
 or
 they're
 always


late
 or
 I
 rarely
 speak
 to
 people
 these


days
 and
 they
 Rave
 about
 their
 teams
 and


these
 cohort
 it's
 usually
 a
 list
 of


complaints
 around
 changing
 attitudes
 in


the
 workplace
 and
 it
 used
 to
 be
 that


people
 were
 lucky
 to
 have
 a
 job
 here
 and


now
 they
 think
 we're
 lucky
 to
 have
 them


and
 the
 power


shifted
 that
 relationship
 between


employer
 and
 employee
 is
 never
 going


back
 and
 you
 have
 to
 understand
 that
 P


power
 Dynamic
 to
 really
 understand
 how


trust
 works
 so
 this
 idea
 that
 now
 a


young
 person
 is
 going
 to
 be
 deferential


to
 the
 organization
 to
 the
 leader
 that


they're
 going
 to
 show
 up
 every
 day
 and


demonstrate
 they
 really
 want
 that
 job


it's
 just
 not
 the
 way
 power
 and
 Trust


works
 so
 as
 a
 young
 person
 I'm
 not


saying
 mean
 differential
 but
 if
 you
 are


reliable
 and
 you
 are


consistent
 that
 trait
 will
 really
 shine


through
 and
 make
 the
 effort
 to
 show
 up


in
 person
 absolutely
 uh
 Rachel
 you
 have


shown
 up
 in
 person
 you
 are
 clearly
 very


reliable
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 trust


than
 I
 did
 an
 hour
 ago
 big
 thanks
 for


coming
 thank
 you
 all
 the
 best
 thanks
