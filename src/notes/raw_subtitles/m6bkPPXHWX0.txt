I
 think
 movies
 play
 the
 role
 in
 our


culture
 that
 myths
 and
 legends
 used
 to


play
 in
 ancient
 cultures
 or
 that
 novels


used
 to
 play
 100
 years
 ago.
 They're
 the


art
 form
 that
 that
 is
 capable
 of


basically
 containing
 and
 expressing
 and


making
 permanent
 the
 most
 important


aspects
 of
 a
 culture
 uh
 or
 of
 a


civilization.


>> There
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 great
 films
 in
 2019


and
 then
 like
 just
 a
 memory
 hole
 of
 like


what
 great
 film
 has
 come
 out
 since
 then.


like
 something
 happened
 in
 Hollywood.


The
 scripts
 that
 are
 being
 written,
 the


types
 of
 things
 that
 are
 being
 made


today
 are
 very
 very
 different
 than
 what


was
 happening
 in
 2018,
 2019.


>> Mark,
 you've
 been
 known
 to
 monitor
 a


situation
 or
 two.
 Uh,
 welcome
 to
 the


program,


>> Eric.
 How
 would
 you
 characterize
 me
 as
 a


situation
 monitorer?


>> Extremely
 eager.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 you
 know,


I
 picture
 you
 with
 Yeah.
 Thorough.
 I
 I


picture
 you
 with
 security
 cameras
 uh


just
 extensively
 monitoring,
 you
 know,


>> at
 all
 hours
 of
 the
 night.
 Um


>> advance.


>> So
 basically
 Howard
 Katherine
 Howard


Hughes
 in
 the
 penthouse
 is
 up
 there.


>> Yeah.


>> Um


>> you're
 an
 elite
 situation
 monitor,
 which


is
 why
 you're
 here.
 We're
 we're
 so
 happy


to
 have
 you.


>> Well,
 speaking
 of
 movies,
 I'm
 watching


all
 the
 James
 Bond
 movies
 with
 with
 my


my
 10-year-old,
 and
 we
 just
 got
 to
 live


and
 let
 D
 No,
 which
 one?
 Diamonds
 Are


Forever,
 which
 is
 the
 one
 set
 in
 Las


Vegas.
 And
 it
 turns
 out
 the
 producer


Harry
 Saltzman
 of
 the
 Bond
 movies
 was
 a


close
 personal
 friend
 of
 Howard
 Hughes


at
 the
 time.
 So
 they
 set
 the
 movie
 in


Vegas
 and
 had
 all
 this
 cooperation
 from


Hughes
 and
 there's
 actually
 Hughes


character
 in
 the
 movie.
 Um
 but
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 give
 a
 spoiler
 alert.
 Uh
 the


Blofeld
 has
 kidnapped
 Hughes
 and
 is


holding
 him
 hostage
 um
 and
 has
 sort
 of


substituted
 in
 and
 is
 is
 pretending
 to


be
 Hughes.
 And
 uh
 Jace
 Bond
 scales
 the


side
 of
 Hughes's
 big
 casino
 uh
 in
 Vegas


at
 the
 time
 and
 drops
 down
 through
 the


skylight
 um
 into
 uh
 essentially
 Howard


Hughes's
 bathroom.
 Um,
 and
 the
 bathroom


is
 literally
 set
 up
 with
 like
 monitors


and
 like,
 you
 know,
 computers
 and
 like


typewriters
 and
 like,
 you
 know,
 an


elaborate
 phone
 system.
 Um,
 and
 then
 a


single
 golden
 roll
 of
 toilet
 paper.


And
 B
 drops
 into
 it
 and
 he's
 like,
 hm.


And
 I
 was
 like,
 that's
 the
 perfect


bathroom.
 Our
 uh
 our
 new
 media
 team
 has


a
 a
 Twitter
 group
 chat
 called
 monitoring


the
 situation
 where
 every
 that's
 that's


the
 room
 that
 we
 they
 want
 in
 the
 office


for
 for
 Exactly.
 All
 the
 things


happening
 on
 Twitter.
 Um
 with
 that
 let's


segue.


>> And
 did
 they
 ask
 for
 it
 to
 be
 the


bathroom?
 Is
 that
 was
 that
 part
 of
 it?


>> Yeah,
 that
 be
 the
 next
 evolution.


>> Would
 that
 just
 be
 an
 added
 an
 add-on
 an


add-on
 feature?


>> Yes.


>> Okay.
 All
 right.
 Let's
 proceed.


>> Mark,
 uh
 not
 that
 many
 pe
 not
 everybody


knows
 this
 about
 you,
 but
 you
 are


extensive
 movie
 buff.
 uh
 and
 movie


afficionado
 and
 you've
 been
 having
 some


commentary
 in
 our
 group
 chats
 lately


over
 some
 films
 that
 you
 think
 are
 are


worth
 watching
 right
 now
 and
 and
 kind
 of


broader
 commentary
 around
 what's
 uh


what's
 been
 happening
 in
 uh
 in
 in
 film.


So
 why
 don't
 why
 don't
 you
 share
 that


with
 us?


>> Yeah.
 So
 let
 me
 start
 by
 saying
 you
 know


kind
 of
 why
 why
 start
 by
 saying
 like
 why


this
 topic
 matters.
 Um
 and
 so
 um
 you


know
 because
 like
 I
 think
 this
 does


matter
 a
 lot.
 So,
 um,
 so
 first
 of
 all,


I'll
 say
 like
 I've
 got
 like
 enormous


respect
 for
 anybody
 who
 does
 anything


creative.
 And
 so,
 like
 every
 time
 I
 see


a
 movie,
 I'm
 just
 kind
 of
 marveling.


Like
 I
 know
 what
 it
 takes
 to
 make
 one.


It's
 like
 making
 a,
 you
 know,
 making
 a


tech
 startup
 or
 something.
 It's
 just


like
 this
 incredible
 labor
 of
 love
 and


effort
 and
 blood,
 sweat,
 and
 tears
 in


everybody's
 part.
 And
 so,
 and
 it's
 just


like
 a
 minor
 miracle,
 I
 think,
 whenever


any
 of
 these
 things
 actually,
 you
 know,


show
 up
 as
 a
 as
 a
 as
 a
 two-hour
 executed


film.
 Um,
 and
 so,
 and
 I
 I
 think
 that's


amazing.
 Um,
 and
 so,
 you
 know,
 none
 of


what
 we're
 about
 to
 talk
 about,
 you


know,
 should
 be
 considered
 a
 knock
 on
 on


on
 filmmakers
 per
 se
 or
 the
 people
 who


put
 all
 this
 work
 into
 it.
 Um,
 and
 then


the
 other
 thing
 I
 say
 is
 look,
 in
 the


last,
 you
 know,
 whatever
 five
 years,


decade,
 20
 years,
 there
 have
 been
 a


tremendous
 number
 of
 what
 you
 could
 call


entertain,
 you
 know,
 highly
 entertaining


movies,
 right?
 And,
 and
 some
 that
 I


think
 are
 like
 jaw-dropping,
 right?
 So,


like,
 you
 know,
 like
 the
 you
 know,
 just


my,
 you
 know,
 one
 of my
 favorite
 genres,


action,
 you
 know,
 the
 John
 Wick
 movies


are
 like,
 you
 know,
 the
 best
 action


movies
 of
 all
 time.
 They're
 all
 on
 the


last
 whatever
 15
 years.
 They're,
 you


know,
 you
 could
 you
 could
 name
 that
 for


a
 lot
 of
 different
 kinds
 of
 movies.
 you


know
 the
 the the
 sort
 of
 uh
 you
 know
 the


entertainment
 factor
 is
 you
 know
 remains


very
 high.
 Um
 having
 said
 that
 you
 know


I
 think
 movies
 and
 Katherine
 I
 see
 if


you
 agree
 with
 me
 on
 this
 or
 not.
 Um
 I


think
 movies
 play
 the
 role
 in
 our


culture
 um
 that
 myths
 and
 legends
 um


used
 to
 play
 in
 ancient
 cultures
 or
 that


novels
 uh
 maybe
 used
 to
 play
 you
 know


100
 years
 ago
 um
 or
 that
 um
 you
 know
 uh


you
 know
 uh
 maybe
 songs
 used
 to
 play
 or


something
 like
 that.
 um
 which
 is


basically
 they're
 the
 art
 form
 that
 that


is
 capable
 of
 basically
 um
 containing


and
 expressing
 and
 making
 permanent
 um


the
 most
 important
 aspects
 of
 a
 culture


uh
 or
 of
 a
 civilization.
 Right?
 So,
 so


sometimes
 you'll
 hear
 the
 term
 like


there's
 this
 term
 called
 the
 great


American
 novel
 and
 there
 you
 know
 this


idea
 there
 are
 these
 certain
 novels
 like


the
 great
 Gatsby
 or
 whatever
 that
 like


or
 to
 kill
 a
 mocking
 bird
 that
 kind
 of


capture
 the
 spirit
 of
 a
 times
 and
 kind


of
 become
 immortal
 through
 doing
 that


and
 and
 I
 think
 you
 know
 basically
 and
 I


love
 novels
 but
 like
 you
 know
 that
 the


idea
 that
 novels
 do
 that
 I
 think
 is


probably
 at
 this
 point
 you
 know
 pretty


unlikely
 for
 a
 variety
 of
 reasons
 we


could
 have
 a
 whole
 separate
 podcast
 on


that
 u
 but
 for
 the
 last
 let's
 say
 at


least
 60
 years
 and
 probably
 100
 years


like
 mo
 movies
 have
 been
 the
 way
 that


that
 that
 that
 our
 culture
 that
 our


culture
 is
 able
 to
 express
 itself
 in
 a


way
 that
 is
 going
 to
 really
 deeply
 stand


the
 test
 of
 time
 where
 people
 100
 and


200
 and
 500
 years
 from
 now
 are
 going
 to


look
 back
 and
 kind
 of
 say
 this
 is
 what


these
 people
 are
 about.
 By
 the
 way,


Katherine,
 would
 you
 agree
 with
 that?


>> Yeah.
 No,
 no,
 definitely.
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 uh
 I
 I
 think
 it
 was
 I
 think
 in


slow
 decline
 probably
 the
 last
 25
 years


um
 because
 fewer
 like
 you
 know
 probably


the
 90s
 was
 the
 like
 the
 last
 decade


where
 everyone
 watched
 the
 same
 movies


and
 the
 Oscars
 were
 indicative
 of
 like


what's
 a
 great
 film
 that
 everyone
 has
 to


see.
 I
 would
 love
 to
 hear
 when
 you
 think


it
 started
 bifurcating,
 but
 it
 does
 feel


like
 there's
 been
 this
 sort
 of


bifurcation
 of
 if,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 you


could
 say
 the
 Tarantino
 films
 of
 the


last
 20
 years
 were
 were
 widely
 watched


and
 mattered
 in
 cinematic
 lore,
 but
 like


it
 it
 feels
 like
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 more
 um


to
 say
 to
 say
 it's
 like
 the
 next
 great


American
 novel
 is
 actually
 the
 next


great
 American
 movie.
 That
 feels
 like


that
 maybe
 that
 ended
 in
 the
 '90s.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 possible.
 Um


although
 you
 could
 also
 say
 you
 know
 it


is
 interesting
 because
 as
 we've


discussed
 in
 other
 other
 other
 forums


it's
 not
 that
 there
 aren't
 cultural


artifacts
 that
 everybody
 participates
 in


like
 you
 know
 everybody
 that
 you
 know


that
 I
 am
 told
 there's
 this
 young
 lady


named
 Taylor
 Swift
 who
 is
 apparently


extremely
 popular
 and
 I
 am
 told
 that


other
 than
 me
 everybody
 follows
 her
 with


a
 great
 deal
 of
 of
 of
 of
 avid
 attention


and
 I'm
 told
 that
 she
 has
 a
 new
 I
 guess


what
 album
 and
 movie
 and


>> album
 was
 that
 album?
 Yeah,
 there's
 a


movie
 there's
 a
 new
 movie
 coming
 out


too,
 I
 think.
 Right.
 I
 I
 believe


>> I
 just
 remember
 I
 remember
 her


breakthrough.
 She
 actually
 her
 first


movie
 um
 was
 the
 movie
 a
 couple
 years


ago
 that
 came
 out
 that
 was
 so
 popular.


Her
 movie


>> she
 had
 a
 a
 like
 a
 a
 thing
 on
 Netflix


that
 was
 sort
 of
 following
 her
 around


the
 the
 kind
 of


>> Okay.
 So,
 okay.
 Here's
 something
 I
 know


about
 Taylor
 Swift
 that
 you
 don't
 which


is
 the
 only
 time
 in
 my
 life
 I'm
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 utter
 those
 words.
 Um
 she
 she


did
 a
 famous
 thing
 actually
 Hollywood
 in


the
 movie
 industry.
 She
 actually
 she


released
 I
 think
 that
 I
 think
 whatever


that
 was
 u
 she
 released
 that
 actually
 in


the
 theaters
 um
 and
 it
 was
 actually
 very


significant
 that
 she
 did
 that
 because


she
 cut
 the
 deal
 directly
 with
 the


theater
 owners
 um
 and
 I
 think
 it
 was a


straight
 50/50
 revenue
 split
 with
 the


theater
 owners
 and
 so
 and
 she
 she
 booked


it
 directly
 and
 it
 was
 like
 on
 like
 it


was
 like
 a
 huge
 release
 was
 like
 on


4,000
 screens
 and
 it
 was
 like
 extremely


popular
 and
 like
 all
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of


you
 know
 Taylor
 Swift
 fans
 and
 a
 lot
 of


you
 families
 with
 young
 girls
 like
 you


know
 went
 to
 see
 it
 and
 I
 I
 remember
 it


at
 the
 time
 because
 it
 was
 the
 same
 it


it it
 it
 went
 big
 the
 same
 week
 that


Martin
 Scaresy's
 movie
 uh
 Killers
 in
 the


Flower
 Moon
 um
 uh
 was
 in
 theaters
 and
 if


you
 remember
 the
 reviews
 and
 Martin


Scazes
 is
 one
 of these
 filmmakers
 who's


made
 these
 mythical
 movies
 you
 know
 that


will
 for
 sure
 stand
 the
 test
 of
 time
 and


so
 you
 know
 Killers
 of
 the
 Flower
 Moon


was
 a
 movie
 that
 he
 intended
 to
 do
 that


and
 we
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 it


it
 did
 and
 we
 could
 talk
 about
 why
 not


but


it
 was
 this
 movie
 about
 you
 know
 was
 a


period
 piece
 set
 in
 the
 1920s
 about
 you


know
 basically
 the
 rape
 and
 pillillage


of
 Native
 American
 you
 know
 re
 you


basically
 natural
 resources
 by
 you
 know


evil
 white
 people
 and
 but
 it
 was
 a


three-hour
 movie
 um
 and
 It
 was
 appar
 I


didn't
 see
 it
 but
 apparently
 it
 was


extremely
 slow
 and
 then
 apparently
 it


had
 these
 extremely
 long
 stretches
 of
 of


silence
 because
 he
 was
 trying
 to
 get


across
 this
 sense
 of
 like
 awe
 and


grandeur
 and
 like
 emotional
 impact
 and


apparently
 what
 would
 happen
 is
 that


movie
 would
 be
 playing
 adjacent
 to
 the


Taylor
 Swift
 movie
 and
 the
 Taylor
 Swift


movie
 was
 so
 loud
 that
 whatever
 he
 would


go
 to
 the
 silent
 part
 you
 would
 just


hear
 Taylor
 Swift
 pounding
 away
 on


stage.
 Um,


>> probably
 helps
 the
 movie
 out.
 Probably
 a


little
 bit


>> arguably
 arguably
 improved
 the
 movie


from
 from
 from


what
 I
 heard,
 you
 know,
 filled
 in
 the


missing
 soundtrack.
 So
 anyway,
 there
 are


still
 mechanical
 issues
 uh
 with
 with


reproduction
 of
 these
 things.
 But
 um
 how


did
 I
 get
 on
 that?
 Um
 so
 anyway,
 the


point
 is
 there
 are,
 you
 know,
 there


there
 are
 these
 things,
 you
 know,
 there


are
 we
 do
 have
 cultural
 artifacts
 that


sort
 of
 have,
 you
 know,
 almost


universal,
 you
 know,
 attention.
 It's


just
 a
 to
 me
 it's
 just
 a
 question
 of


like
 okay
 like
 where
 are
 the
 what
 like


say
 true
 art
 like
 with
 a
 capital
 A
 is


the
 thing
 that
 not
 only
 captures
 the


popular
 imagination
 like
 not
 only
 that


people
 really
 experience
 but
 also
 is
 the


thing
 that
 actually
 has
 the
 lasting


impact
 such
 that
 in
 10
 years
 and
 20


years
 and
 50
 years
 and
 100
 years
 like


people
 are
 still
 discussing
 it
 and
 is
 it


and
 then
 you
 know
 maybe
 a
 couple
 things


you
 could
 you
 could
 say
 one
 is
 like
 as


time
 passes
 the
 sort
 of
 most
 important
 c


cultural
 artifacts
 are
 sort
 of


continuously
 reinterpreted
 right
 and
 so


the
 the
 way
 that
 comes
 across
 when
 it's


released
 is
 not
 the
 same
 way
 that
 comes


across
 5
 or
 10
 years
 later
 and
 then
 20


years
 later
 and
 then
 sort
 of
 each
 new


generation
 that
 discovers
 it,
 you
 know,


maybe
 interprets
 it
 and
 talks
 about
 it


in
 a
 different
 way.
 Um
 and
 then
 um
 yeah


and
 then
 and
 then
 so
 basically
 like


capital
 A
 art
 is
 is
 the
 ability
 to
 do


that.
 And
 so
 like
 I
 I
 like
 for
 sure
 it's


true
 that
 the
 audience
 overall
 has


fragmented.
 For
 sure
 it's
 true
 that
 like


the
 internet
 you
 know
 has
 like
 you
 know


created
 you
 know
 is
 sucking
 away
 you


know
 just
 enormous
 amounts
 of
 time
 and


attention
 uh
 from
 movies.
 Um,
 you
 know,


it's
 it's
 certainly
 true
 that
 um,
 you


know,
 the
 business
 pressures
 in


Hollywood,
 which
 we
 can
 talk
 about,
 are,


you
 know,
 are
 probably
 more
 intense
 than


ever,
 but
 it
 is
 but
 it
 is
 still
 true


that
 I
 think
 it
 is
 still
 possible
 to
 do


what
 we're
 describing.
 And
 and,
 you


know,
 we
 we'll
 talk
 about
 this
 more,
 but


I
 think
 we
 we'd
 all
 agree
 Tarantino,
 you


know,
 was
 able
 to
 do
 this
 with
 Once
 Upon


a
 Time
 in
 Hollywood,
 not
 that
 recently.


So,
 anyway,
 maybe
 I
 can
 say
 I
 still
 hold


out
 hope
 this
 is
 possible.
 Um,
 like
 I
 I


think
 this
 is
 a
 thing
 that
 that
 that
 the


best
 filmmakers
 in
 the
 world,
 uh,
 in
 the


country
 really
 ought
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do.


Would
 you
 would
 you
 agree
 with
 that
 or


do
 you
 think
 it's
 Do
 you
 think
 that's


that's
 too
 optimistic?


>> I
 hope.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 I
 think
 I'm
 a
 little


more
 pessimistic
 than
 you
 that
 I
 I
 do


think
 Once
 Upon
 a
 Time
 in
 Hollywood
 is


the
 last
 American
 movie,
 but
 for


different
 reasons
 probably
 like
 I
 think


not
 only
 what
 you
 know,
 it's
 like
 again


like
 Tarantino
 is,
 you
 know,
 this
 I


think
 he
 has
 one
 more
 film
 in
 him
 as
 he


says,
 but
 that
 was
 really
 his
 his
 final


opus,
 right?
 Like
 the
 penultimate
 film


is
 the
 the
 that
 that
 was
 what
 he
 had


been
 kind
 of
 moving
 towards
 and
 I
 think


he
 said
 his
 last
 film
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


much
 kind
 of
 scaled
 down
 smaller
 sort
 of


film
 when
 he
 decides
 to
 do
 it.
 But
 like


I
 I
 think
 there's
 something
 about
 2019


in
 particular.
 There
 were
 so
 many
 great


films
 in
 2019.
 There
 was
 1917.
 Uh


Parasite
 won
 the
 Oscar.
 Stole
 it
 from


Once
 Upon
 a
 Time
 in
 Hollywood
 in
 my


opinion,
 but
 still
 was
 like
 a
 decent


film.
 Like
 there
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 great


films
 in
 2019.
 And
 then
 like
 just
 a


memory
 hole
 of
 like
 what
 great
 film
 has


come
 out
 since
 then.
 like
 I
 I
 some


something
 happened
 with
 COVID
 where
 we


stopped
 going
 to
 the
 theater
 and
 it
 does


kind
 of
 map
 to
 that
 you
 know
 no
 one
 goes


to
 the
 theater
 anymore
 but
 it's
 also


like
 something
 happened
 in
 Hollywood


which
 I
 know
 we
 want
 to
 get
 your
 take
 on


what
 happened
 in
 Hollywood
 because
 it


does
 feel
 like
 there


>> you
 know
 the
 the
 scripts
 that
 are
 being


written
 the
 the
 types
 of
 things
 that
 are


being
 made
 today
 are
 very
 very
 different


than
 what
 was
 happening
 in
 2018
 2019


>> yeah
 so
 just
 spend
 a
 moment
 let's
 spend


a
 moment
 on
 the
 state
 of
 Hollywood
 sort


of
 for
 people
 who
 don't
 track
 it
 and
 so


there's
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 so
 yeah
 look


the
 the
 theater
 business
 has
 obviously


taken
 a
 giant
 hit
 kind
 of
 in
 the
 wake
 of


co
 you
 know
 co
 was
 like
 this
 big,
 you


know,
 was
 this
 big
 step
 down,
 you
 know,


because
 the
 theaters,
 you
 know,
 were


closed
 along
 with
 everything
 else.
 And


then
 there
 there
 was
 this
 there's
 been


this
 question
 ever
 since
 of
 kind
 of
 how


to
 re-engage
 those
 audiences
 and
 get


them
 to
 go
 back
 to
 the
 theater
 and,
 you


know,
 that,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 that's
 just


a
 secular
 change
 that
 goes
 with
 people


being
 on
 their
 phones
 or
 whatever.
 You


know,
 having
 said
 that,
 it's
 not
 quite,


you
 know,
 I
 don't
 think
 a
 complete


explanation
 for
 what's
 happened
 to
 the


art
 form
 and
 and
 the
 reason
 for
 that
 is


that
 the the
 length
 of
 time
 that
 it


takes
 to
 actually
 make
 a
 movie.
 Um,


right.
 And
 so
 the
 movies
 that
 showed
 up


in
 the
 theater
 in
 2019
 got
 green
 lit
 in,


you
 know,
 call
 it
 2015
 or
 2016.
 you


know,
 they
 got
 staffed
 in
 2016,
 2017,


and
 then
 they
 got
 executed
 in
 like
 20,


you
 know,
 basically
 2017,
 2018.
 Um,
 and


and
 then
 they
 went
 through,
 you
 know,


editing
 and
 post-production
 and
 so


forth.
 And,
 you
 know,
 for
 for
 big


movies,
 that's,
 you
 know,
 that
 whole


process
 is
 like
 a
 two-year
 process.
 Um,


and
 then
 and
 then
 there's
 the
 long
 run


up
 to
 release
 with
 the
 marketing


campaign
 and,
 you
 know,
 all
 the,
 you


know,
 put
 the
 actors
 on
 the
 road
 and
 and


do
 all
 the
 stuff.
 And
 so
 there's
 like
 a


whatever
 a
 fourmonth
 ad
 campaign
 or


whatever.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 by
 the
 time


you
 go
 through
 that
 process,
 you
 know,


start
 to
 end,
 it's
 like
 four
 or
 five


years.
 And
 so
 for
 once
 upon
 a
 time
 to


show
 I
 don't
 know
 exactly
 when
 it
 was


green
 lit,
 but
 for
 it
 to
 for
 when
 it
 to


for
 it
 to
 show
 up
 in
 2019
 meant
 that


basically
 it
 the
 the
 the
 making
 of
 it


the
 backstory
 probably
 starts
 you
 know


no
 no
 later
 than
 2015.
 Um
 and
 and
 I
 just


bring
 that
 up
 which
 means
 the
 movies


that
 hit
 the
 theaters
 in
 2021
 started
 in


like
 2017,
 right?
 And
 the
 movies
 that


are
 showing
 up
 today
 started
 in
 2020,


right?
 And
 so
 so
 the
 the the
 co


explanation
 is
 not
 sufficient
 for
 what


we've
 seen
 in
 the
 last
 5
 years
 because


those
 movies
 weren't
 green
 lit
 under


conditions
 of
 co
 those
 movies
 were
 green


lit
 under
 conditions
 of
 pre-COVID.
 Um


and
 so
 what
 whatever
 changes
 have
 taken


place
 um
 which
 which
 we
 can
 talk
 about


um
 I
 think
 start
 you
 know
 probably


started
 around
 2015


>> and
 and
 what
 is
 your
 theory
 around
 why


things
 really
 started
 changing
 in
 the


2020
 decade
 of
 film.


>> Yeah.
 So
 again
 let
 me
 let
 me
 give
 you


know
 again
 sort
 of
 maximum
 maximum
 you


know
 kind
 of
 uh
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 respect


here
 which
 is
 like
 there's
 no
 question
 a


couple
 things.
 So
 just
 the
 secular


changes.
 So
 one
 thing
 is
 look
 the


streaming
 revolution
 has
 had
 a
 very
 big


impact
 and
 and
 the
 streaming
 revolution


hit
 Hollywood
 incredibly
 hard
 very


positively
 for
 a
 stretch
 basically


through
 the
 2010s
 because
 the
 all
 the


companies
 that
 were
 engaged
 in
 the


streaming
 wars
 started
 spending
 just


unprecedented
 amounts
 of
 money
 on
 on
 on


televisions
 and
 shows
 of
 all
 on
 shows


and
 movies
 of
 all
 kinds
 and
 so
 there
 was


just
 a
 giant
 flood
 of
 money
 and
 I
 would


say
 the
 mood
 in
 Hollywood
 I
 don't
 know


whatever
 eight
 years
 ago
 or
 something


six
 years
 ago
 was
 you
 might
 even


describe
 as
 euphoric
 from
 a
 business


standpoint
 just
 because
 like
 I
 mean
 the


big
 thing
 was
 when
 Netflix
 scaled
 up
 to


the
 point
 where
 they
 were
 spending
 $20


billion
 a
 year
 on
 on
 on
 content,
 which


is
 just
 like
 this,
 you
 know,
 this
 giant


budget
 and
 everybody
 else.
 They
 were


like,
 you
 know,
 whatever,
 a
 dozen


streaming
 companies
 or
 whatever,
 all
 the


different
 platforms
 that
 wanted
 to


compete.
 Um,
 and
 and
 so
 that
 money
 kind


of
 took
 off
 like
 a
 rocket.
 And
 then


what's
 happened
 is
 as
 the
 streaming
 as


the
 streamers
 are
 consolidating,
 as
 the


streaming
 wars
 are
 are
 kind
 of


rationalizing,
 that
 money
 got
 pulled


back.
 Um,
 that
 was
 a
 big,
 you
 know,
 kind


of
 financial
 blow.
 And
 then
 the
 other


thing
 that
 streaming
 did
 that
 has
 really


affected
 things
 a
 lot
 in
 in
 Hollywood
 in


a
 very
 negative
 way,
 which
 is,
 uh,


streaming
 cut
 off
 the
 financial
 upside.


um
 to
 the
 to
 to
 films
 and
 TV.
 And
 so
 uh


films
 used
 to
 when
 they
 were
 hits
 they


they
 first
 they
 would
 sell
 a
 lot
 of
 box


office
 um
 and
 then
 they
 would
 and
 then


they
 would
 sell
 like
 the
 television


rights
 or
 you
 know
 you
 know
 ultimately


the
 streaming
 rights
 and
 then
 and
 then


they'd
 had
 this
 long
 aftermarket
 where


they
 would
 you
 know
 sell
 DVDs
 uh
 you


know
 videotape
 rentals
 in
 the
 80s
 90s


and
 then
 DVDs
 in
 the
 2000s
 and
 2010s
 and


so
 if
 you
 had
 a
 movie
 that
 was
 a
 hit


like
 it
 could
 run
 and
 you
 know
 it
 could


run
 for
 years
 generating
 just
 like


enormous
 amounts
 of
 of
 of
 revenue
 and


cash.
 Um,
 and
 then
 same
 thing
 with
 TV


shows.
 You
 know,
 it
 used
 to
 be
 a


successful
 TV
 show.
 The
 line
 I
 think
 was


six
 seasons
 in
 a
 movie
 where
 if
 it
 got


to
 like
 whatever
 hundred
 episodes
 or


something,
 it
 would
 enter
 syndication


and
 then
 you
 could
 sell
 it
 for
 hundreds


of
 millions
 of
 dollars
 and
 there
 would


be
 all
 this
 upside
 for
 the
 people


involved
 in
 creating
 it.
 And
 what


happened
 with
 streaming
 on
 the
 economics


of
 streaming
 is
 those
 those
 forms
 of


upside
 just
 vanished
 because
 what


happens
 is
 the
 streamers
 just
 buy
 the


projects
 with
 like
 a
 cost
 plus
 model
 a


lot
 of
 the
 time.
 Um,
 and
 so
 you
 make
 the


movie
 and
 you
 turn
 around,
 you
 sell
 it


for
 like
 a
 10%
 profit
 margin
 uh
 to
 a


streamer.
 Uh,
 and
 then
 there's
 no


aftermarket
 because
 it's
 just
 a
 tile
 on


the
 streaming
 service,
 right?
 And
 and


and
 there's
 no,
 you
 know,
 there's
 no
 DVD


sales,
 there's
 no,
 you
 know,
 there's
 no


TV
 syndication
 rights.
 Those
 concepts


are
 irrelevant.
 You
 know,
 the
 streamer


just
 has
 sort
 of
 a
 perpetual
 ride
 or
 a


20-year
 ride
 or
 whatever
 to
 be
 able
 to


show
 at
 that
 sort
 of
 fixed
 fee.
 Um
 and


so
 so
 the
 upside
 got
 cut
 off
 and
 that


that
 removed
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 the


economic
 incentive
 for
 kind
 of
 the


wildcatting
 thing
 that
 Hollywood
 used
 to


do
 more
 which
 is
 to
 really
 take
 you
 know


take
 these
 chances
 um
 on
 things
 you
 know


like
 Hollywood
 used
 to
 work
 a
 lot
 like


the
 venture
 capital
 model
 which
 is
 you


know
 you
 you
 you
 put
 10
 you
 know
 you
 put


10
 10
 lines
 in
 the
 water
 you
 get
 you


know
 you
 get
 four
 bites
 and
 you
 get


maybe
 one
 you
 grand
 slam
 um
 and
 and
 you


know
 if
 it
 works
 like
 that's
 a


spectacular
 model
 but
 you
 the
 grand
 slam


has
 to
 be
 able
 to
 scale
 economically
 in


order
 for
 that that
 to
 happen
 and
 that's


been
 cut
 off.
 So,
 so,
 so
 that
 that
 that


did
 not
 help.
 And
 then,
 and
 then
 there's


the
 big
 thing,
 um,
 capital
 B,
 capital
 G,


u,
 capital
 T,
 the
 big
 thing
 that


happened,
 of
 course,
 which
 is
 Hollywood


being
 on
 the
 vanguard
 of
 culture
 got
 hit


by


the
 thing,
 um,
 the
 cultural
 change
 of


the
 last
 decade,
 like
 incredibly
 hard.


And,
 you
 know,
 we've
 we've
 talked
 a
 lot


about
 how
 tech,
 you
 know,
 got
 hit
 by


that
 incredibly
 hard.
 Um,
 and
 Hollywood


got
 hit
 by
 it
 in
 a
 in
 a
 very
 intense


way.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 nobody's
 ever
 quite


figured
 out
 the
 right
 way
 to
 to
 talk


about
 this.
 Uh,
 to,
 you
 know,
 say
 some,


you
 know,
 sometimes
 you
 say
 things
 like


wokeness
 or
 or
 whatever.
 Um,
 you
 know,


in
 the
 60s
 they
 would
 have
 called
 it
 the


new
 left.
 Um,
 there
 there's
 actually
 a


term
 there's
 actually
 my
 my
 favorite


term
 for
 in
 Hollywood
 is
 there's
 a


YouTube
 channel
 called
 critical
 drinker


uh
 where
 he's
 a
 uh
 he's
 a
 movie
 reviewer


um
 uh
 is
 is
 quite
 funny
 and
 and
 the


critical
 drinker
 has
 been
 documenting


basically
 the
 thing
 uh that
 hit


Hollywood
 and
 he
 and
 in in
 I
 say
 in


quite
 scathing
 terms
 um
 this
 whole
 time.


Um,
 and
 what
 he
 calls
 it
 is
 he
 calls
 it


the
 message.
 Um,
 and
 it's
 right,
 it's


the
 message
 with
 a
 capital
 M.
 But
 it's


actually
 really
 funny
 because
 for
 a
 long


time
 people
 who
 watch
 the
 critical


drinker,
 he
 would
 never
 actually
 define


what
 the
 message
 was.
 You
 know,
 he
 would


basically
 just
 say,
 you
 know,
 this
 this


this
 movie
 has
 been
 affected
 by
 the


message,
 right?
 And
 of
 course,
 and
 you


you
 guys
 are
 both
 laughing
 because
 of


course
 you
 already
 know
 what
 the
 message


was.
 Everybody
 knows
 the
 message
 was,


right?
 All
 white
 people
 are
 racist.
 All


men
 are,
 you
 know,
 sexist.
 You
 know,


everybody's
 a
 transphobe.
 And
 you
 you


you
 just
 go
 America's,
 you
 know,
 a
 force


for
 evil
 in
 the
 world,
 right?
 and
 you


just
 go
 like
 right
 down
 the
 list
 of
 like


everything
 that
 you
 know
 everything
 that


you
 would
 expect
 you
 know
 from
 the
 last


decade
 um
 you
 know
 America's
 you
 know


incipient
 fash
 fascist
 regime
 like
 just


the
 entire
 package
 you
 know
 basically


you
 know
 like
 whatever's
 on
 the
 front


page
 of
 the
 New York
 Times
 that
 day


right
 just
 the
 message
 um
 and
 so
 you


know
 movies
 transform
 themselves
 you


know
 very
 large
 percentage
 of
 movies


that
 could
 have
 been
 great
 you
 know
 you


know
 you
 know
 in
 some
 alternate
 world


could
 have
 been
 these
 these
 these
 these


great
 works
 of
 art
 just
 just
 basically


became
 became
 in
 some
 form
 political


propaganda


Uh
 or
 or
 you
 could
 if
 you
 wanted
 to
 be


more
 generous
 you
 could
 say
 that
 you


know
 those
 will
 be
 the
 lasting
 artifacts


of
 this
 last
 decade
 right
 which
 is


historians
 will
 look
 back
 and
 they'll
 be


like
 holy
 you
 know
 holy
 lord
 like
 these


people
 were
 really
 like
 wrapped
 around


the
 axle
 on
 like
 a
 bunch
 of
 political


issues
 like
 my
 my
 you
 know
 my
 goodness


um
 and
 so
 they
 got
 hit
 hard
 by
 that
 and


then
 the
 other
 and
 then
 that
 that
 led
 to


in
 Hollywood
 you
 know
 what
 can
 only
 be


described
 as
 a
 reign
 of
 terror
 um
 which


and
 and
 this
 is
 something
 that


occasionally
 Hollywood
 figures
 will
 talk


about
 this
 in
 public
 although
 very


rarely
 because
 they
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 a


very
 sensitive
 topic
 still
 but
 um
 you


know
 if
 if
 you
 know
 people
 in
 Hollywood


you
 know
 basically
 is
 through
 that


through
 the
 especially
 the
 last
 you
 know


eight
 years
 you
 know
 they
 they
 just
 they


felt
 like
 if
 they
 made
 one
 misstep
 on


you
 know
 casting
 or
 on
 this
 details
 in


the
 script
 or
 use
 of
 words
 or
 the
 themes


of
 a
 movie
 or
 anything
 you
 know
 they


they
 just
 felt
 like
 they
 were
 in
 danger


of
 just
 like
 a
 lightning
 strike
 from
 you


know
 from
 from
 you
 know
 from
 from
 the


sky
 just
 like
 striking
 them
 dead
 on
 the


spot
 like
 you
 know
 and
 they
 they
 they


had
 like
 friends
 you
 know
 everybody
 in


Hollywood
 had
 like
 friends
 whose
 careers


just
 got
 like
 completely
 detonated


you
 know,
 at
 one
 point,
 you
 know,
 in
 one


unpredictable
 way
 or
 another.
 Um,
 and


and
 again,
 people
 have
 different


opinions
 on
 this
 and
 you
 could
 argue
 it


was
 it
 was
 long
 needed
 or
 whatever,
 but


like
 it
 it
 became
 it
 became
 a
 thing
 and


it
 like
 it
 basically
 changed
 the
 process


of
 like
 how
 projects
 were
 selected.
 It


changed
 the
 pro
 changed
 the
 process
 of,


you
 know,
 who
 made
 projects.
 It
 changed


the
 process
 of
 staffing.
 It
 changed
 the


process
 of
 screenwriting.
 It
 changed
 it


changed
 changed
 acting.
 It
 it
 changed,


you
 know,
 aesthetics.
 It
 it
 changed
 like


almost
 every
 aspect
 of
 of
 of
 how
 these


projects
 get
 executed.
 But
 and
 I
 just
 go


go
 through
 that
 because
 um
 I
 I
 think


that
 that
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 changing


again
 right
 now.
 Like
 if
 you
 talk
 to
 the


same
 people
 in
 Hollywood,
 what
 they'll


tell
 you
 basically
 is,
 you
 know,
 it's


basically
 this
 year
 um
 that
 that
 the


fever
 has
 broken.
 Um
 and
 there's
 a
 bunch


of
 indications
 for
 that
 and
 and
 we're


entering
 kind
 of
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 post


sort
 of
 post
 message
 uh
 um
 uh
 you
 know,


kind
 of
 era.
 Um
 and
 you
 know,
 we
 don't


know
 what
 era
 we're
 heading
 into.
 Maybe


there's
 a
 new
 message
 or
 something,
 but


like
 we're
 we're
 we're
 we're
 there's
 a


phase
 shift
 that's
 underway.
 Um
 but
 but


that
 phase
 shift
 is
 going
 to
 take
 time


because
 it
 takes
 time
 to
 make
 movies,


right?
 The
 movies
 that
 are
 green
 lit


today,
 right,
 are
 not
 going
 to
 come
 out,


you
 know,
 until
 like
 whatever
 20
 like


2027,
 2028
 soonest.
 And
 so
 we
 we
 we
 so


we're
 in
 this
 like
 liinal
 period
 or
 this


inter
 interstitial
 period
 where
 for
 the


next
 like
 3
 years
 we're
 going
 to
 get


like
 a
 thousand
 movies
 that
 have
 like


the
 message
 and
 they're
 all
 going
 to
 act


like
 the
 message
 is
 like
 brand
 new
 and


fresh
 and
 nobody's
 ever
 heard
 it
 before


cuz
 they,
 you
 know,
 they
 all
 pretend


that
 this
 is
 like
 some
 big
 revelation


that
 like
 all
 white
 people
 are
 racist,


right?
 Um
 like
 in
 every
 movie.
 Um
 and


there's
 going to
 be
 like
 a
 thousand
 more


of
 those
 in
 the
 next
 three
 years
 and


they're
 just
 going
 to
 land
 like
 an


absolute
 thud,
 right?
 Like
 cuz
 it's
 just


like
 if
 you
 wanted
 that
 message,
 you
 got


it,
 right?
 You
 already
 saw
 a
 thousand


movies
 to
 set
 you
 like
 the
 next
 thousand


movies
 don't
 contribute
 to
 that,
 right?


And
 and
 just
 just
 to
 knock
 on
 one
 and


he's
 a
 brilliant
 filmmaker,
 but
 I
 I
 just


saw
 the
 new
 Paul
 Thomas
 Anderson
 movie


um
 one
 battle
 after
 another
 and
 it
 like


it's
 literally
 like
 a
 time
 capsule.
 It's


like
 a
 2022
 time
 capsule.
 It's
 literally


like
 time
 frozen
 2022.
 Um,
 and
 in
 2022,


this
 movie
 would
 have
 been
 like,
 "Oh
 my


god,
 like
 this
 movie
 is
 like
 got
 the


message,
 right?
 It's
 just
 like


everything
 about
 it."
 We
 could
 we
 could


spend
 hours
 just
 on
 this
 movie.
 Um,
 and


it
 lands
 today
 and
 you're
 just
 watching,


you're
 just
 like,
 "Wow,
 that
 was
 a
 weird


time."
 Like,
 oh
 my
 goodness.


>> I
 want
 to
 talk
 more
 about
 this
 movie


because,
 uh,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 Brett
 Een


Ellis
 who
 came
 out
 and
 was
 the
 first


person,
 you
 know,
 because
 it's
 getting


all
 the
 Oscar
 plot.
 It's
 like,
 oh,
 it's


it's
 definitely
 in
 line
 for
 the
 Oscar,


right?
 And
 he
 came
 out,
 he's
 like,
 it


feels
 musty,
 right?
 Okay.
 And
 I
 I
 should


get
 the
 actual
 like
 language
 he
 used


because
 it
 was
 much
 worse
 than
 that.
 But


he
 said
 it's
 like
 a
 musty
 film.
 It's


exactly
 what
 you
 said.
 It's
 2022.
 Like


this
 was
 green
 lit
 at
 a
 very
 different


time
 and
 now
 it's
 come
 out
 and
 like
 the


world's
 moved
 on.
 And
 so
 I'm
 I'm
 curious


like
 do
 you
 think
 that
 that
 that
 we're


still
 going
 to
 pretend
 these
 movies
 are


great
 even
 though
 they
 don't
 match
 with


our
 time
 or
 is
 there
 going
 to
 be
 sort
 of


a
 three-year
 period
 where
 we
 are
 allowed


to
 say
 actually
 like
 that
 that
 doesn't


make
 any
 sense
 anymore
 and
 like
 maybe


that
 movie
 shouldn't
 have
 been
 made.


>> Yeah.
 So
 this
 is
 it's
 a
 it's
 this
 one
 is


a
 complicated
 this
 is
 a
 complicated


scenario.
 So
 just
 on
 the
 movie
 itself,


um
 the
 movie
 itself
 is
 actually
 and
 it's


it's
 quite
 like
 I
 quite
 enjoyed
 watching


it.
 I
 quite
 enjoyed
 watching
 it
 not
 just


for
 ironic
 reasons,
 but
 just
 also


watching
 it
 of
 like
 how
 how
 this


happened.
 uh
 like
 and
 and
 and
 there's
 a


bunch
 bunch
 of
 reasons
 and
 you
 know
 and


again
 the
 filmmakers
 one
 of
 one
 of the


you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 great
 filmmakers
 of


the
 era
 Paul
 Thomas
 Anderson
 you
 know
 he


made
 there
 will
 be
 blood
 and
 he
 made
 you


know
 um
 um
 Boogie
 Knights
 and
 like
 all


these
 you
 know
 by
 the
 way
 he
 made
 right


there
 was
 named
 two
 movies
 Boogie
 Nights


and
 there
 Will
 Be
 Blood
 are
 two
 movies


that
 are
 like
 in
 the
 in
 the
 they're


going
 to
 be
 in
 the
 Hall
 of
 Fame
 of
 the


art
 form
 where
 it's
 like
 you
 know
 100


years
 from
 now
 people
 are
 going
 to
 be


like
 wow
 you
 know
 that's
 what
 that


culture
 was
 about.
 Um
 and
 so
 he
 he's


he's
 he
 is
 one
 of
 those
 guys
 and
 clearly


that's
 what
 he
 was
 going
 for
 in
 this


movie.
 It
 is
 a
 weird
 movie
 in
 that
 it's


it's it's
 partially
 based
 on
 a
 famous


Thomas
 Pinchin
 novel
 called
 Vineland.
 um


which
 is
 Thomas
 Pinchin's
 movie
 uh
 is


Thomas
 Pinchin's
 novel
 basically
 about


the
 the
 it's
 essentially
 I
 mean
 it's


essentially
 veiled
 through
 whatever
 but


it's
 basically
 like
 about
 the
 days
 of


rage
 um
 you
 know
 the
 Brian
 Burough
 book


or
 the
 you
 know
 the
 weather
 underground


you
 know
 bas
 basically
 the
 the
 violent


social
 revolution
 um
 you
 know
 basically


from
 the
 far
 left
 in
 the
 60s
 and
 and


then
 sort
 of
 what
 happened
 in
 the


aftermath
 of
 that
 um
 and
 so
 like
 that


that
 that's
 the
 theme
 of
 the
 novel
 but


it's
 it's
 very
 much
 a
 novel
 of
 and
 about


the
 1960s
 it's
 not
 considered
 you
 know


most
 people
 don't
 consider
 it
 maybe
 the


the
 best
 pinchion
 novel
 but
 like
 it's


it's
 a
 mid
 tier
 one
 and
 it's
 it's
 in
 the


pantheon
 and
 it
 it
 turns
 out
 it
 had
 been


Paul
 Thomas
 Anderson's
 favorite
 novel.


he'd
 been
 trying
 to
 make
 a
 version
 of
 it


for
 20
 years
 or
 whatever.
 And
 but
 what


he
 did
 basically
 was
 he
 he
 kept
 the
 he


kept
 the
 very
 basic
 kind
 of
 plot


framework
 setup,
 but
 then
 he
 completely


updated
 it
 for
 the
 message,
 right?
 And


so
 like
 it
 has
 like
 specifically
 it
 has


a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 but
 like
 it
 has
 this


whole
 basically
 it's
 a
 racial,
 you
 know,


it
 has
 a
 whole
 racial
 kind
 of
 plot


structure
 to
 the
 whole
 thing.
 Um
 and
 and


and
 sexual
 in
 ways
 that
 are
 fairly


amazing.
 Um
 uh
 but
 that
 are
 completely


based
 on
 the
 current
 moment
 of
 you
 know


circa
 2022.
 Um,
 and
 so
 it's
 a
 little
 bit


like
 the
 1960.
 It's
 it's
 like
 the
 it's


like
 the
 it's
 like
 the
 it's
 like
 the


early
 2020s
 filtered
 through
 uh
 the


1960s.
 And
 so
 it's
 just
 a
 little
 bit
 odd


with
 that.
 Arguably,
 it
 is
 kind
 of


salient
 to
 our
 times
 because
 I
 think
 if


you
 were
 to
 retitle
 the
 movie,
 you
 would


just
 title
 it
 Antifa
 the
 movie.
 Like


it's
 like
 it's
 like
 a
 fullthroated


celebration
 of
 basically
 violent
 social


change,
 violent
 social
 revolution.
 Like


and
 it's
 it's
 completely
 unap
 like
 I'm


going
 to
 spoil
 I'm
 going
 to
 spoil
 I'm


going
 to
 spoil
 it.
 I'm
 just
 going
 to


spoiler
 alert.
 Yeah.
 by
 the
 end.


>> Spoiler
 alerts
 for
 monitoring
 the


situation.
 Everyone's
 already
 seen
 it


here.
 So,


>> it's
 a
 so
 it's
 a
 2hour
 and
 45minute


movie
 that
 I
 went
 by
 the
 way
 and
 I
 went


to
 the
 theater
 and
 I
 paid
 full
 price
 and


like
 I
 smuggled
 in
 my
 snacks
 and
 like


the
 whole
 thing.
 Um
 I
 go
 through
 the


whole
 thing
 and
 I'm
 like
 hoping
 he's


such
 a
 brilliant
 filmmaker.
 I'm
 hoping


it's
 a
 subversive
 movie,
 right?
 And
 so


I'm
 kind
 of
 hoping
 that
 the
 whole
 thing


he's
 like
 by
 the
 end
 he's
 like
 really


like
 he's
 like
 okay
 like
 these
 weather


underground
 people
 who
 like
 went
 on
 the


run
 for
 20
 years
 and
 destroyed
 their


lives
 and
 like
 you
 know
 we're
 were


always
 you
 know
 basically
 just
 like
 you


know
 crazed
 privileged
 children
 like


raging
 out
 against
 their
 you
 know
 their


basically
 their
 parents
 and
 blowing
 [ __ ]


up
 and
 killing
 people
 and
 just
 the
 whole


thing
 was
 a
 giant
 mistake
 and
 and
 I
 was


kind
 of
 hoping
 that
 that
 would
 you
 know


that
 would
 be
 kind
 of
 the
 way
 that
 you


could
 tell
 the
 story.
 No
 no no
 he's
 just


like
 oh
 no
 that
 was
 great
 like
 like
 that


was
 fantastically
 good.
 These
 people
 are


amazing
 like
 they're
 they're
 these
 are


the
 myths
 and
 legends
 of
 our
 time.
 he


clearly
 wants
 to
 make
 these
 people
 into


mythical
 figures
 and
 then
 at
 the
 end
 and


then
 if
 he
 it's
 just
 very
 clear
 at
 the


end
 he's
 like
 yes
 and
 I
 completely


endorse
 and
 support
 all
 of
 this
 um
 and


this
 is
 exactly
 what
 ch
 you
 know
 this
 is


these
 are
 the
 role
 models
 that
 children


should
 have
 and
 it's
 fantastic
 right
 um


and
 so
 you
 know
 in
 a
 this
 is
 one
 of


those
 movies
 where
 in
 a
 perverse
 way


maybe
 maybe
 it
 stands
 the
 test
 of
 time


that
 way
 where
 it's
 just
 like
 wow
 these


people
 had
 like
 these
 people
 are


constructed
 a
 mythos
 you
 know
 by
 by
 by


by
 by
 in
 which
 violent
 robbery
 and
 like


violent
 robbery
 and
 murder
 basically
 is


great
 right
 like
 is
 wonderful
 right
 and


so
 you
 know
 may
 Maybe
 that's,
 you
 know,


I
 don't know.
 Maybe
 it's
 like
 reading


Emma
 Goldman
 Emma
 Goldman
 essays
 a


century
 later
 or
 something.
 It's
 just


like,
 wow,
 these
 people
 kind
 of
 really


got
 carried
 away,
 but
 like,
 you
 know,


it's
 it's
 not
 what
 it
 could
 have
 been.


Anyway,
 this
 this
 is
 the
 Okay,
 so
 so
 one


is
 it's
 it's
 out
 of
 time,
 although
 you


know,
 hopefully
 won't
 become
 more


relevant.
 Um,
 and
 then
 uh
 the
 other
 is


again
 that
 the
 business
 aspect
 of
 it,


which
 is,
 you
 know,
 being
 a
 great


filmmaker.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 the
 one


that
 he
 got
 like
 the
 real
 budget
 for.
 So


this
 is
 like
 a
 much
 bigger
 budget
 than


any
 of the
 other
 movies
 that
 he's
 made.


Um,
 and
 with
 that
 he
 was,
 you
 know,
 the


cast
 is
 like
 just
 incredible.
 like
 so


it's
 you
 know
 Leo
 DiCaprio
 and
 Sean
 Pen


and
 Benito
 Del
 Toro
 and
 like
 all
 these


amazing
 you
 know
 actors
 and
 actresses
 um


but
 as
 a
 consequence
 I
 don't
 have
 the


numbers
 in
 the
 top
 of
 my
 head
 but
 you


know
 it
 it
 was
 estimated
 it
 cost


something
 on
 the
 order
 of
 $200
 million


to
 make
 um
 and
 then
 it's
 it's
 more
 money


on
 top
 of
 that
 um
 for
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 for


for
 advertising
 um
 the
 the
 challenge
 and


and
 then
 you
 know
 it's
 got
 Leo
 and
 you


know
 he's
 by
 the
 way
 he's
 fantastic
 in


it
 very
 entertaining
 but
 um
 by
 the
 way


what
 yeah
 spoiler
 alert
 one
 one
 of
 the


things
 about
 the
 message.
 Um,
 it's
 got


the
 message.
 So,
 the
 Leo
 character,
 I


don't know,
 plays
 one
 of
 these


basically.
 He's
 a
 bomber
 basically
 in


hiding
 for
 like
 18
 years
 or
 whatever,


and
 he's
 got
 this
 daughter,
 the
 daughter


of
 his
 his his
 lover
 who's
 this
 uh
 was


this
 uh,
 you
 know,
 great
 like
 basically


uh,
 you
 know,
 violent
 revolutionary
 in


the
 era.
 Um,
 and
 uh,
 they've
 been
 in


hiding
 for
 18
 years
 and
 he's
 like


completely
 fried
 his
 brain
 on
 like,
 you


know,
 drugs
 and
 alcohol.
 It's
 just
 like,


you
 know,
 he's
 completely
 blown
 out
 as
 a


person.
 He
 spends
 the
 entire
 movie


running
 around
 like
 in
 his
 bathrobe


like,
 you
 know,
 basically,
 you
 know,


basically
 high.
 Um,
 and
 and
 if
 you


actually
 watch
 the
 movie
 carefully
 all


the
 way
 through,
 it
 actually
 turns
 out


nothing
 he
 actually
 does
 at
 any
 point
 in


the
 plot
 ever
 actually
 matters.
 Like


like
 he
 he
 plays
 no
 actual
 role
 in
 the


plot.
 Um,
 and
 so
 it's
 this
 like


incredible
 performance
 and
 it's


incredibly
 it's
 incredibly
 um,
 you
 know,


dynamic
 and
 entertaining
 performance
 and


the
 movie
 the
 movie
 is
 going
 to
 sell
 do


well
 overseas
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that


because
 people
 love
 Leo.
 Um,
 but
 like


again
 it's
 consistent
 with
 the
 message


of
 of
 course
 the
 white
 male
 lead
 can


have
 no
 actual
 role
 to
 play
 in
 the
 plot.


Like
 it
 it
 is
 you
 know
 that's
 definitely


not
 allowed
 like
 in
 the
 climax,
 he


literally
 shows
 up
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


climax
 and
 just
 like
 I'm
 here
 and
 like


it's
 it's
 like
 all
 over,
 right?
 Like


everybody's
 dead.
 Like
 it's
 all
 it's


just
 done.
 Um


so
 so
 anyway,
 it
 it's
 going
 to
 do


reasonably
 well
 because
 because
 you
 know


because
 it
 has
 Leo,
 but
 it's
 still
 going


to
 lose
 like
 $120
 million
 are,
 you
 know,


the
 estimates
 that
 I'm
 hearing,
 which


is,
 you
 know,
 a
 pretty
 pretty
 big
 loss.


>> Um
 you
 know,
 for
 for
 for
 a
 movie
 like


this.
 the
 the
 the
 fear
 in
 Hollywood


always
 is
 when
 there's
 when
 there's
 a


movie
 that
 loses
 that
 much
 money,
 you


know,
 will
 the
 executive
 green
 green


light
 new
 original
 movies?
 Um,
 and
 you


know,
 so
 hope
 hopefully
 they
 drove


hopefully
 the
 lesson
 is
 drawn
 from
 this


is,
 you
 know,
 basically
 it's,
 you
 know,


is
 is
 is
 the
 is
 the
 Brad
 Eastern
 Ellis


point,
 which
 is
 the
 the the
 what
 is
 what


do
 you
 say
 the
 fussiness
 or
 the
 um


>> musty
 he
 said
 it's
 a
 musty
 film
 like


>> mustustininess.
 Yeah.
 Hopefully
 the


conclusion
 is
 don't
 make
 movies
 that
 are


going
 to
 be
 musty
 when
 they're
 released,


right?
 like
 you
 know
 you
 you
 didn't
 have


you
 know
 you
 didn't
 have
 to
 green
 light


the
 thousandth
 movie
 with
 the
 message
 in


2022
 like
 that
 was
 a
 choice
 you
 know
 so


maybe
 don't
 do
 that
 anymore
 um
 you
 know


but
 but
 you
 know
 but
 but
 maybe
 it's
 time


to
 move
 on
 let
 me
 highlight
 the
 movie
 on


the
 other
 side
 that
 I
 think
 is
 very


underappreciated
 and
 I
 think
 has
 you


know
 I
 you
 could
 say
 maybe
 at
 best
 right


now
 it's
 becoming
 a
 cult
 classic
 it's


just
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 hit
 but
 like
 I
 I


have
 hopes
 for
 it
 and
 I
 hope
 it
 becomes


one
 of
 these
 mythic
 movies
 which
 is


Edington


and
 uh
 let
 me
 let
 me
 start
 by
 asking


have
 you
 guys
 both
 at
 this
 point
 seen


Edington


>> I
 haven't
 I
 haven't
 Okay.
 Well,
 you're


you're
 in
 for
 a
 treat.
 So
 So
 my
 opinion,


my
 opinion,
 personal
 opinion,
 Edington


is
 the
 first
 capital
 A
 art
 art
 great
 art


movie.
 I
 I
 I've
 I
 feel
 like
 I've
 seen


since
 once
 once
 upon
 a
 time
 in


Hollywood,
 and
 I
 I
 think
 it
 clears
 the


bar.
 And
 and
 I
 start
 by
 saying
 it's
 not


a
 perfect
 movie.
 Like,
 you
 know,
 there,


you
 know,
 there
 there
 are
 things
 about


it
 that,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 sure
 five
 years


from
 now
 or
 whatever,
 the
 even
 the
 maker


of
 the
 movie
 might
 look
 back
 and
 say,


you
 know,
 could
 have
 done
 things


differently.
 So
 but
 but
 it's
 like
 it's


it's


like
 it
 has
 the
 opposite
 of
 the
 musty


feeling.
 It
 has
 the
 feeling
 of,
 oh,
 I'm


actually
 finally
 seeing
 on
 screen
 real


people
 again.
 Like,
 finally,
 um,
 uh,


like
 real
 people
 set
 in
 the
 real
 world


doing
 real
 things
 where
 you're
 just


like,
 wow,
 like
 that
 that
 I
 I'm
 actually


seeing
 the
 world
 that
 we've
 actually


spent
 the
 last
 5
 years
 living
 in.
 And


it's
 the
 first
 movie,
 uh,
 like
 that
 that


that
 I've
 seen
 in
 a
 long
 time.
 And


specifically,
 it's
 the
 first
 movie,
 and


it's
 amazing
 that
 this
 is
 the
 case,
 even


with
 the
 time
 scales
 that
 we're
 talking


about.
 It's
 the
 first
 movie
 in
 which


like
 the
 George
 Floyd
 riots
 actually


happened.
 Um,
 it's
 it's
 the
 first
 movie


in
 which
 CO
 actually
 happened.


>> Um,
 it's
 the
 first
 movie
 in
 which
 social


media
 actually
 happened.
 Um,
 it's
 the


first
 movie
 in
 which
 wokeness
 actually


happened.
 It's
 the
 first
 movie
 in
 which


Trump
 actually
 happened.
 like
 and
 and


it's
 actually
 and
 this
 is
 why
 I'm
 sort


of
 having
 the
 reaction
 to
 the
 movie
 that


I'm
 having
 which
 is
 just
 like
 it's
 the


only
 movie
 in
 which
 any
 of
 those
 things


actually
 happened
 in
 the
 universe
 of
 the


movie
 cuz
 like
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 you
 tell


unless
 I
 miss
 something
 like
 every
 other


movie
 that's
 come
 out
 that's
 been


significant
 over
 the
 last
 5
 years
 like


it's
 as
 if
 none
 of
 that
 ever
 happened


and
 and
 and
 and
 my
 explanation
 for
 that


is
 these
 are
 all
 the
 hot
 button
 issues


that
 if
 you
 screwed
 them
 up
 you
 in


Hollywood
 you
 got
 your
 career
 destroyed


right
 so
 if
 if
 you
 if
 you
 said
 the
 wrong


thing
 about
 co
 lockdowns
 or
 vaccines.
 If


you
 said
 the
 wrong
 thing
 about
 Trump,
 if


you
 said
 the
 wrong
 thing
 about
 the
 Floyd


riots,
 if
 you
 said
 the
 wrong
 thing
 about


wokeness,
 like
 your
 career
 get


obliterated.
 So,
 we
 have
 like
 a


generation
 of
 creatives
 who
 basically


just
 like
 got
 taught
 do
 not
 touch
 the


stove.
 And
 and
 the
 aur
 who
 made


Edington,
 it's
 an
 art
 tour
 movie,
 this


guy
 Eric
 Aster,
 who's
 this
 young
 aur,


very
 talented
 guy,
 he
 basically
 was


like,
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 grab
 the
 stove


with
 both
 hands


>> and
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 like
 hold
 it
 up


for
 dear
 life.
 And
 it's
 like
 a
 roller


coaster
 ride
 through
 every
 crazy
 [ __ ]


thing
 that
 happened
 in
 the
 last
 five


years.
 And
 I
 was
 just
 like
 howling
 with


laughter.
 Put
 it
 this
 way.
 Me
 and
 the


other
 four
 people
 in
 the
 theater
 who
 are


watching
 it
 were
 just
 like,
 "Wow,


it
 was
 amazing.
 It's
 finally
 happening."


>> Other
 bright
 side
 of
 this
 too
 is
 that


it's
 not
 unknown
 actors,
 right?
 It's
 uh


it's
 walking
 Phoenix,
 Emma
 Stone.
 Um
 and


and
 what's
 what's
 really
 interesting


about,
 as
 you
 said,
 like
 there's
 most


media
 or
 you
 know,
 most
 most
 movies
 try


to
 kind
 of
 gloss
 over
 social
 media
 or


things
 where
 it's
 like
 actually
 hard
 to


depict
 it
 on
 a
 screen.
 Like
 there's


nothing
 really
 interesting
 about
 looking


at
 your
 phone,
 but
 like
 getting
 a
 COVID


nostril
 test
 is
 actually
 like
 very


funny.
 And
 I
 know
 like
 the
 trailer


begins
 with
 like
 pulling
 up
 in
 this
 like


old
 car
 and
 getting
 the
 nostril
 test.


It's
 just
 like
 it's
 just
 like
 a
 funny


thing.
 And
 so
 it's
 like
 it's
 good
 that


some
 of
 these
 more
 like
 absurd
 things


that
 have
 happened
 in
 the
 last
 couple


years.
 Like
 they're
 actually
 very


cinematic
 and
 they
 should
 be
 put
 on
 C


like
 they
 should
 be
 put
 like
 great


filmmakers
 should
 be
 should
 showing
 them


because
 they're
 so
 funny.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I'll
 do
 a
 couple
 again.
 I'm


going to
 blow
 through
 the
 spoilers.


Yeah.
 So
 the
 opening
 scene
 is
 Waen


Phoenix.
 Wa
 Keane
 Phoenix
 plays
 this


basically
 this
 crusty
 sheriff
 of
 this


small
 town
 in
 New
 Mexico
 called
 Edington


which
 actually
 kind
 of
 reminds
 me
 of
 the


town
 I
 grew
 up
 in.
 And
 the
 key
 thing
 for


the
 thing
 is
 Edington
 like
 there's
 just


nothing
 in
 the
 town.
 Like
 it's
 like
 600


people.
 It's
 just
 like
 the
 streets
 are


empty,
 the
 stores
 are
 empty.
 I
 mean
 it's


like
 a
 town
 that
 was
 empty
 before
 CO,


right?
 Um
 and
 then
 and
 then
 the


lockdowns
 hit
 and
 then
 it
 be
 and
 it


became
 even
 more
 desolate.
 But
 like


there's
 nothing
 happening
 and
 you
 could


just
 walk
 around
 and
 there's
 nobody


there.
 And
 so,
 uh,
 W
 Phoenix
 plays
 the


sheriff
 who's
 like
 this
 crusty,


unreonstructed,
 and
 he's
 not
 really
 a


Trump
 supporter,
 per
 se,
 but
 he's
 like


this
 sort
 of
 crusty,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of


traditionalist,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of
 kind


of
 guy.
 He's
 the
 kind
 of
 guy
 who
 just


really
 does
 not
 want
 things
 to
 change


that
 much.
 Um,
 and
 like
 everything
 is


changing
 around
 him.
 And
 it
 it
 starts
 it


starts
 in
 it
 starts
 when
 CO
 it
 starts
 in


like
 April
 of
 2020.
 Um,
 and
 he's
 sitting


in
 this
 pickup
 truck
 in
 the
 middle
 of


nowhere
 and
 he's
 like
 eating
 a
 sandwich


or
 whatever.
 And
 the
 this
 other
 truck


pulls
 up
 next
 to
 him
 and
 it's
 these
 u


you
 know,
 it's
 it's
 a
 set
 in
 New
 Mexico.


So
 there's
 these
 those
 the
 town
 that


he's
 in
 are
 adjacent
 to
 these
 tribal


lands.
 And
 so
 these
 two
 tri
 young
 tribal


cops,
 you
 know,
 Native
 American
 cops


pull
 up
 in
 in
 a
 in
 a
 pickup
 truck
 next


to
 him
 and
 they're
 like,
 you
 know,


they're
 like
 young
 and,
 you
 know,
 let's


say
 cooler
 than
 he
 is.
 Um
 and
 and


they're
 they
 like
 they
 and
 they're
 both


wearing
 their
 masks,
 right?
 U
 and
 and


and
 literally
 they're
 like,
 "Roll
 down


your
 window."
 And
 he
 rolls
 the
 window


and
 and
 literally
 from
 their
 pickup


truck
 into
 his
 they're
 like, "You
 have


to
 put
 your
 mask
 on,


right?"


And
 you
 know
 this
 like
 literally
 it
 was


like
 for
 me
 it
 was
 like
 you
 know
 it
 was


like
 the
 you
 know
 the
 heaven
 has
 opened


the
 angels
 are
 singing
 I'm
 finally


seeing
 a
 capital
 M
 movie
 like
 this
 and


you
 know
 like
 he's
 a
 brilliant
 and
 so


like
 he
 he
 gets
 across
 like
 in
 one
 look


the
 feeling
 that
 I
 think
 we've
 all
 had


for
 the
 last
 5
 years
 which
 is
 like
 like


what
 the
 [ __ ]
 it's
 a
 and
 that's
 just
 the


opening
 scene
 and
 then
 it
 cascades


through
 all
 the
 co
 and
 then
 it
 cascades


through
 and
 then
 you
 know
 spoiler
 alert


again
 or
 spoiler
 it
 cascades
 through


Floyd,
 so
 the
 Floyd
 riots
 hit
 midway


through
 the
 movie
 and
 then
 all
 the
 and


then
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 um
 the
 of


course
 you
 know
 the
 local
 high
 school


it's
 like
 you
 know
 the
 local
 high
 school


is
 like
 100%
 white
 um
 you
 know
 New


Mexico
 and
 and
 you
 know
 and
 then
 the


white
 kids
 basically
 become
 like


obsessed
 with
 racial
 justice
 even
 though


they
 literally
 don't
 know
 any
 black


white
 people
 and
 they
 start
 like


basically
 having
 like
 full-blown
 riots


like
 you
 know
 in
 in
 the
 main
 street
 and


like
 breaking
 store
 windows
 and
 like


crashing
 everything
 and
 there's
 one


there's
 one
 black
 there's
 one
 black


person
 in
 town
 who's
 a
 sheriff's
 deputy


who's
 keen
 deputy
 who's
 military
 vet
 and


he's
 just
 like
 what
 the
 hell
 like
 he's


like


like
 why
 why
 do
 I
 have
 to
 defend
 the


grocery
 store
 from
 the
 white
 kids
 like


trying
 to
 burn
 it
 down
 on
 my
 behalf
 like


what
 the
 [ __ ]
 Anyway,
 so
 so
 so
 the


whole
 movie
 is
 like
 that
 and
 then
 maybe


maybe
 just
 one
 more
 thing
 about
 it


that's
 just
 hysterical.
 Eric,
 this
 is
 a


good
 time
 for
 you
 to
 take
 a
 drink
 of


water
 because
 you're
 going
 to
 love
 this


part.
 Um
 this
 is
 good
 for
 the
 spit
 take


out
 what
 um
 Pedro
 Pascal
 is
 in
 it.
 Um,


and
 at
 first
 you
 would
 think
 Pedro


Pastel
 plays
 the
 mayor
 and
 at
 first


you're
 like,
 "Oh,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


clear
 setup
 uh
 where
 you
 know
 we


finished
 is
 like
 the
 retrograde


rightwinger
 and
 you
 know
 Pascal
 is
 like


the
 voice
 of
 reason."
 It's
 like
 no
 no


he's
 Gavin
 Newsome.
 Like
 I
 swear
 to
 God


he's
 Gavin
 Newsome.
 Like
 100%
 Pedro


Pascal
 is
 playing.


>> What
 What
 does
 he
 do?


>> I
 I
 don't
 even
 want
 to
 like
 it's
 it's


it's
 it's
 I
 don't
 even
 want
 to
 like
 I
 I


don't
 I'm
 not
 even
 intending
 to
 bad.
 I'm


just
 saying
 like
 or
 or
 just
 every
 other


politician.
 whatever
 is
 your
 idea
 of
 a


politician
 who's
 like
 Gavin
 Newsome
 like


Peter
 Pascal
 Peter
 Pascal
 plays
 him
 and


just
 like
 could
 not
 be
 looking
 down
 on


the
 the
 the
 the
 sheriff
 character
 with


more
 contempt.
 Um
 like
 just
 absolutely


just
 like
 you
 know
 and
 and
 vice
 versa


and
 then
 and
 then
 basically
 what
 happens


is
 that
 you
 know
 they
 they
 effectively


so
 the
 so
 the
 the
 uh
 the
 sheriff
 gets


frustrated
 by
 the
 whole
 thing
 the


lockdowns
 and
 everything
 and
 so
 he
 he


decides
 to
 run
 for
 mayor
 and
 so
 then
 it


becomes
 a
 fight
 you
 know
 between
 the
 two


of
 them.
 Um
 which
 by
 the
 way
 is
 just
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 movie
 like
 it
 it
 then


gets
 actually
 quite
 a
 bit
 more
 elaborate


after
 that.
 Um,
 but
 the
 big
 thing
 about


it
 is
 it
 just
 it's
 like
 a
 full
 it's
 just


like
 an
 absolute
 full
 frontal


examination
 from
 top
 to
 bottom
 and
 and


like
 it
 pulls
 in
 it
 like
 Katherine
 it


doesn't
 have
 it's
 interesting
 it
 doesn't


have
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 it
 doesn't
 have
 like


a
 lot
 of
 on-creen
 graphics
 of
 like


people
 on
 social
 media
 but
 it
 does
 have


this
 recurring
 thing
 which
 again
 is
 just


it's
 incredible
 how
 rare
 this
 is
 in


movies
 or
 maybe
 other
 filmmakers
 haven't


figured
 out
 how
 to
 do
 it
 which
 is
 these


characters
 live
 in
 a
 world
 of
 social


media.
 Um
 and
 so
 he
 he
 does
 this
 great


like
 when
 a
 character
 in
 this
 movie


wakes
 up
 he
 rolls
 over
 and
 he
 checks
 his


phone
 right?
 Like
 it's
 it's
 it's
 our


it's
 our
 world
 and
 and
 he
 does
 I
 think
 a


very
 good
 job
 of
 showing
 the
 interle


back
 and
 forth
 of
 how
 people
 are
 and


again
 this
 is
 like
 a
 you
 know
 rural
 town


in
 the
 middle
 of
 nowhere.
 People
 are


living
 this
 you
 know
 this
 double
 life


that
 that
 we
 all
 now
 live
 which
 is
 we've


got
 our
 inerson
 life
 and
 then
 we've
 got


our
 online
 life
 and
 there's
 this
 you


know
 question
 of
 which
 one
 is
 more
 real.


Um,
 and
 and
 and
 this
 is
 the
 first
 movie


I've
 seen
 that
 actually
 just
 and
 and
 it


doesn't
 incorporate
 that.
 Like
 it's
 not


social
 media
 the
 movie.
 Like
 that's
 not


what
 the
 movie
 is
 about,
 but
 it's
 just


kind
 of
 it
 just
 kind
 of
 shows
 naturally


how
 the
 nature
 of
 reality
 has
 changed


around
 that
 and
 then
 how
 it
 how
 it


influences
 real
 world
 behavior.
 Um,
 and


anyway,
 so
 I
 I
 can't
 recommend
 it
 highly


enough.


>> Isn't
 Emma
 Stone's
 character
 like
 taken


by
 conspiracy
 that
 she
 finds
 online
 or


like
 like
 what
 what
 is
 her
 her
 role
 in


the
 movie?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 so
 this
 is
 part
 of
 the
 uh
 so


and
 and
 at
 this
 point
 I'm
 like
 grabbing


the
 stove
 with
 with
 both
 hands
 also
 like


she
 she
 plays
 like
 she
 plays
 like
 the


upper
 middle
 class
 white
 woman
 um
 uh


who's
 just
 like
 wrecked
 with
 anxiety
 and


and
 this
 is
 like
 this
 is
 the
 plot
 arc


like
 she's
 just
 like
 she's
 like


incredibly
 deeply
 unhappy.
 Um
 and
 so


yeah,
 so
 she
 gets
 locked
 into
 like


online
 conspiracies
 and
 then
 there's


this
 whole
 thing.
 I
 don't
 even
 I
 don't


even
 want
 to
 spoil
 the
 thing
 that


happens
 with
 her
 because
 it's
 it's
 quite


it's
 quite
 something
 and
 it's
 quite
 a


plot
 arc
 of
 its
 own.
 that
 um
 you
 know


she
 she
 has
 her
 own
 her
 own
 kind
 of


parallel
 life
 that
 kind
 of
 unfolds


through
 this.
 She's
 because
 she's


watching
 Fenix's
 husband
 and
 like
 and
 he


he
 loves
 her
 and
 has
 absolutely
 no
 idea


what
 she
 he
 has
 absolutely
 no
 clue


what's
 going
 on
 in
 her
 head.
 Like
 he


like
 married
 to
 her.
 He
 loves
 her.
 She's


clearly
 extremely
 depressed.
 She's


clearly
 extremely
 anxious.
 He
 has
 no


ability
 whatsoever
 to
 understand
 her


communicate
 with
 her.
 And
 then
 her


mother,
 you
 know,
 her
 mother,
 you
 know,


her
 mother,
 she's,
 you
 know,
 very
 close


with
 her
 mother.
 her
 mother
 keeps


showing
 up,
 you
 know,
 lives
 in
 town
 just


and
 just
 [ __ ]
 hates
 him
 and
 just
 is


like
 scathing
 towards
 him
 and
 he's
 like,


"What?
 You
 know
 what?
 [ __ ]
 I'm
 doing
 my


best.
 I
 can't
 read
 her
 mind.
 Like,
 I


don't
 know
 what's
 going
 on."
 And
 so,
 you


know,
 it's
 got
 that,
 you
 know,
 it's
 it's


got
 like
 a
 whole
 it's
 got
 like
 a
 whole


it's
 got
 like
 a
 whole
 arc
 there.
 Um,
 and


then
 and
 then
 it's
 got
 another
 one
 more.


It's
 got
 the
 uh
 there's
 there's
 the
 uh


in
 the
 little
 in
 the
 little
 high
 school.


Um
 there's
 a
 uh
 there's
 a
 a
 very


attractive
 you
 know
 blond
 blonde
 high


school
 girl
 uh
 who
 basically
 like


becomes
 like
 completely
 committed
 to


social
 justice
 um
 and
 is
 going
 on
 and


she's
 got
 like
 all
 the
 you
 know


patriarchy.
 She's
 got
 all
 the
 talking


points
 like
 she's
 you
 know
 she's
 ready


for
 her
 you
 know
 sociology
 degree.
 Um,


and
 and
 then
 all
 the
 all
 the
 like
 boys


and
 men
 like
 orbiting
 around
 her


basically
 like
 become
 obsessed
 with
 like


there's
 a
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 white
 uh


uh
 male
 high
 school
 kid
 who
 just
 like
 is


like
 just
 generally
 oblivious
 and
 he
 he


like
 has
 a
 thing
 for
 her
 and
 so
 like
 he


starts
 reading
 Angela
 Davis
 um
 like
 in


in
 an
 attempt
 to
 basically
 become


attractive
 for
 her.
 Um
 and
 uh
 and
 uh


anyway
 so
 like
 and
 he
 starts
 spouting


off
 about
 white
 privilege
 and
 the
 whole


thing.


>> Does
 it
 work?


Uh
 um


>> because
 that's
 always
 the
 question.


>> It
 doesn't
 work


>> asking
 for
 tips.


>> It
 doesn't
 it
 doesn't
 work.
 It
 doesn't


work
 for
 the
 purposes
 that
 he
 it
 doesn't


work
 for
 the
 purposes
 that
 he
 intends
 it


for.
 But
 um
 he
 he
 let's
 say
 he
 he


ultimately
 u
 yeah
 he
 has
 a
 very


successful
 I
 would
 say
 plot
 arc
 of
 his


own.
 Um
 yes
 he
 he
 actually
 plays
 plays
 a


major
 role
 in
 the
 in
 the
 he
 goes
 in
 his


own
 journey
 and
 plays
 a
 major
 role
 the


end
 of
 the
 movie.
 Um
 anyway,
 so
 it's


just
 like
 it's
 one
 of
 these
 movies
 and


you
 know
 people
 there's
 like
 you
 know


different
 critiques
 of
 it
 and
 it's
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 know


what
 they
 call
 like
 a
 shaggy
 dog
 story


where
 like
 as
 the
 movie
 goes
 like


increasingly
 crazy
 things
 are
 happening


and
 and
 um
 and
 and
 things
 get
 kind
 of


you
 know
 they
 they
 get
 kind
 of
 deranged


in
 in
 in
 sort
 of
 a
 way
 that
 you
 know
 is


is
 uh
 you
 know
 you
 could
 argue
 is
 like


truly
 reflective
 how
 deranged
 things
 got


or
 you
 could
 say
 you
 know
 maybe
 he
 gets


a
 little
 bit
 carried
 away
 but
 like
 it's


just
 it
 it
 directly
 it's
 it's
 it's
 such


it's
 such
 it's
 such
 direct
 engagement


with
 our
 times
 that
 that
 that
 and
 to
 me


it
 just
 like
 wow
 I'm
 actually
 seeing
 on


screen
 our
 world
 as
 opposed
 to
 these


this
 sort
 of
 man
 either
 this


manufactured
 view
 of
 a
 world
 that


doesn't
 exist
 or
 this
 sort
 of
 manicured


view
 where
 these
 topics
 have
 just
 become


untouchable
 and
 so
 anyway
 so
 my
 my
 hope


is
 it's
 the
 beginning
 of
 a
 wave
 of
 like


there's
 so
 much
 material
 you
 know
 this


is
 the
 old
 Tom
 Wolf
 thing
 which
 is
 like


what
 did
 he
 what
 was
 Tom
 Wolf's
 term
 um


he
 said
 what
 was
 it
 the
 his
 term
 is
 it


the
 eight
 was
 the
 eight
 bill
 was
 is
 the


the
 beast
 with
 8
 billion
 feet
 or
 what


was
 his
 term
 like
 the
 mass
 of
 humanity


he
 had
 this
 term
 where
 he's
 like
 like


Tom
 Wolf
 always
 had
 this
 point
 view,
 you


know,
 the
 great
 novelist
 journalist,
 the


most
 interesting
 topic
 in
 the
 world
 is


like
 the
 human
 race,
 right?
 Like
 the
 the


the
 collective
 behavior
 of
 8
 billion


people
 on
 planet
 Earth
 is
 like
 the
 most


interesting
 thing
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 like


the
 8
 billion
 people
 on
 planet
 Earth
 are


always
 getting
 up
 to
 like
 the
 craziest


[ __ ]
 And
 like
 if
 you
 want
 to
 like
 write


great
 fiction,
 he
 was
 always
 telling


people
 who
 wanted
 to
 write
 fiction.
 He's


like,
 "If
 you
 want
 to
 write
 great


fiction,
 you
 want
 to
 go
 out
 and
 you
 want


to
 be
 with
 the
 people
 and
 you
 want
 to


actually
 observe
 what's
 happening."
 And


it's
 so
 crazy
 that
 if
 you
 just
 like


write
 it
 down,
 you
 know,
 that
 that's
 how


you
 that's
 how
 you
 like
 write
 the
 great


American
 novel.
 Like
 that's
 what
 you
 do.


And
 so
 he
 he
 would
 famously
 do
 this.
 And


so
 when
 he
 did
 Bonfire
 the
 Vanities,
 he


immersed
 himself
 in
 Wall
 Street.
 And


when
 he
 did
 a
 Man
 and
 Full,
 he
 immersed


himself
 in,
 you
 know,
 Atlanta
 real


estate.
 And
 when
 he
 when
 he,
 you
 know,


he
 did
 all,
 you
 know,
 Back
 Back
 to


Blood,
 he
 immersed
 himself
 in
 the
 in
 the


Miami,
 you
 know,
 Miami
 culture.
 And,
 you


know,
 he
 he
 would
 go
 do
 this.
 And
 of


course,
 you
 know,
 his
 critique
 was,
 you


know,
 the
 new
 generation
 novelist,
 they


sit
 in
 their
 apartment
 in
 Brooklyn,
 you


know,
 you
 know,
 you
 know,
 with
 their


typewriter,
 you
 know,
 and
 and
 and
 they


they
 introspect,
 right?
 And
 and and


that's
 why
 there
 there's
 no
 more
 great


American
 novels.
 And
 so
 like
 Ari
 is
 like


the
 fil
 he's
 like
 the
 filmmaker
 who
 got


that.
 I
 don't
 know if
 he
 ever
 got,
 you


know,
 red
 wolf
 or
 not,
 but
 like
 where
 he


he
 he
 he
 understands
 that.
 He's
 like,


"Oh,
 go
 immerse
 yourself
 in
 in
 in
 in


what's
 actually
 happening
 um
 in
 real


life
 and
 translate
 that."
 And
 he's
 he's


he
 he
 was,
 I
 don't
 know,
 uniquely
 able


to
 do
 it.
 Uniquely
 able
 to
 get
 away
 with


it.
 Um
 I'm
 hoping
 he's
 the
 beginning
 of


a
 wave
 of
 these.
 And
 you
 know,
 they


don't
 it
 doesn't
 all
 have
 to
 be
 about
 CO


or
 the
 Floyd
 rights
 or
 whatever.
 There's


many
 many
 other
 topics
 you
 could
 do,
 but


like
 you
 know,
 there
 should
 be
 a
 great


there
 should
 be
 a
 great
 movie
 for
 every


basically
 significant
 social
 cultural


thing
 that
 happens.
 Um
 and
 and
 and
 that


and
 there's
 th
 those
 opportunities
 are


just
 laying
 all
 there's
 like
 hundreds
 or


thousands
 of
 those
 opportunities
 just


laying
 on
 the
 ground
 right
 now,
 you


know,
 for
 for
 for
 the
 creatives
 who
 can


go
 pick
 them
 up.
 And
 again,
 if
 and
 by


the
 way,
 every
 creative
 writing
 this
 or


hearing
 this
 is
 going
 to
 say,
 "Yeah,
 no


[ __ ]
 but
 this,
 you
 know,
 will
 the


studios
 green
 light
 it
 and
 pay
 for
 it?"


Um,
 and
 that's
 that
 would
 be
 my
 other


hope,
 which
 is,
 you
 know,
 some


combination
 of
 of
 the
 Boulder
 executives


at
 the
 streamers
 and
 at
 the
 at
 the
 at


the
 studios,
 you
 know,
 example,
 you


know,
 David
 David
 Olson,
 you
 know,
 who's


clearly
 very
 very,
 you
 know,
 brilliant


guy,
 you
 know,
 taking
 over
 Paramount
 and


maybe
 maybe
 buying
 more
 studios,
 like,


you
 know,
 guys
 like
 him
 are
 in
 a


position
 to
 greenlight
 an
 entirely
 new


generation
 of
 of
 of
 movie
 that
 could
 be


both
 commercially
 successful
 and
 could


be
 true
 art.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 I
 know.
 So,
 I
 guess
 is
 it
 your


view
 that
 like
 we'll
 have
 this
 like
 5
 to


sevenyear
 window
 of
 musty
 films
 that


people
 like
 kind
 of
 pretend
 are
 decent,


but
 then
 like
 we
 we
 kind
 of
 get
 the


Edingtons
 as
 well
 where
 you're
 where


you're
 going
 to
 see
 things
 open
 up


again.
 So,
 we'll
 have
 this
 sort
 of
 like


nice
 period
 of
 weirdness.
 Like
 I


actually
 think
 looking
 back
 50
 years


from,
 you
 know,
 50
 years
 from
 today,


it'll
 be
 fun
 to
 look
 back
 at
 these
 films


and
 be
 like
 that
 was
 wild
 that
 that
 was


what
 we
 were
 time.
 So
 I
 but
 your
 your


view
 is
 that
 that
 it
 is
 going
 to
 open
 up


that
 there
 will
 be
 more
 Edingtons,


there'll
 be
 more
 extremes
 and
 it's
 not


just
 going
 to
 be
 um
 one
 battle
 after


another
 um
 kind
 of
 the
 message.


>> Yeah.
 So
 um
 just
 quickly
 one
 more
 thing


on
 one
 battle
 after
 another.
 So
 um
 the


the
 critics
 are
 rapturous
 about
 this


movie,
 right?
 And
 so
 if
 you
 read
 Rotten


Tomatoes,
 the
 critics
 are,
 you
 know,


it's
 like
 98%
 or
 whatever.
 And
 the


critics
 are
 just
 like
 this
 is
 like
 the


most
 brilliant
 movie
 of
 all
 time.
 This


completely
 captures
 you
 know
 yes
 this
 is


like
 this
 is
 like
 the
 ultimate


chronicling
 of
 like
 America's
 you
 know


descent
 and
 it
 being
 you
 know
 the
 fourth


Reich
 like
 you
 know
 this
 is
 yes
 this
 is


like
 absolutely
 glory
 yes
 absolutely


revol
 revolutionary
 violence
 should
 be


glorified
 like
 the
 critics
 are
 like
 all


in
 right
 and
 and
 and
 you
 know
 the
 movie


critic
 community
 has
 like
 gone
 hard
 in


on
 this
 just
 like
 you
 know
 just
 like
 so


many
 other
 critic
 communities
 and
 so


they're
 all
 in
 by
 the
 way
 this
 movie
 I


don't
 know if
 it's
 going
 to
 but
 like
 it


wouldn't
 be
 surprising
 if
 it
 sweeps
 the


Oscars
 right
 it's
 just
 like
 you
 know
 the


best
 the
 best
 the
 best
 movie
 ever
 made


um
 you
 know
 and
 I
 and
 and
 but but
 how


it's
 just
 going
 to
 be
 like
 every


everybody
 everybody
 everybody
 who
 has


been
 been
 through
 this
 you
 know
 spin


cycle
 for
 the
 last
 eight
 years
 is
 you


know
 I
 think
 people
 are
 on
 to
 it
 you


know
 including
 the
 audience
 and
 so
 I
 and


I
 think
 even
 the
 people
 participating
 in


kind
 of
 what
 is
 already
 kind
 of
 an
 orgy


of
 kind
 of
 hyperexaggerated
 critical


admiration
 are
 probably
 all
 realizing


that
 they're
 you
 know
 fundamentally


being
 dishonest
 but
 um
 you
 know
 like
 so


so
 Katherine
 to
 your
 point
 like
 yeah


that
 machine
 like
 the
 the
 the
 the
 sort


of
 the
 message
 machine
 like
 that
 machine


is
 continuing
 to
 spin
 for
 now
 it's
 just


very
 clear
 that
 like
 there's
 just
 like


smoke
 and
 parts
 flying
 off
 of
 it
 like


it's
 just
 you
 know
 it
 is
 it
 is
 it
 is


going
 to
 it
 is
 going
 to
 rattle
 to
 a
 stop


and
 then
 if
 you
 if
 you
 talk
 to
 people
 in


Hollywood
 basically
 what
 they'll
 tell


you
 is
 by
 by
 the
 way
 independent
 of


people's
 politics
 what
 the
 sort
 of
 I


would
 say
 short
 people
 in
 Hollywood


generally
 all
 say
 is
 yeah
 the
 the


cultural
 fever
 has
 broken
 you
 can
 now


make
 you
 can
 now
 get
 movies
 green
 lit


today
 that
 you
 could
 not
 get
 green
 lit


two
 years
 ago
 um
 specifically
 and
 this


this
 is
 amazing
 then
 this
 is
 good
 but


like
 you
 can
 have
 comedies
 again
 uh


like
 they
 actually
 say
 by
 the
 way
 they


say
 this
 like
 they're
 like
 we
 we
 can
 now


make
 comedies
 Yeah.
 Um,
 you
 can
 have


funny
 movies.
 Uh,
 right.
 Because
 to
 have


funny
 movies,
 you
 need
 to
 poke
 a
 sacred


cow,
 right?
 Like
 the
 thing
 that
 makes


comedy
 funny
 is
 like
 when
 it's
 when
 it's


like
 subversive,
 when
 it
 when
 it
 when
 it


like,
 you
 know,
 when
 it
 touches
 a
 nerve,


like
 that
 that's
 that's,
 you
 know,


that's
 what
 great
 adult
 comedy
 is.
 Um,


and
 and
 you
 know,
 you
 just
 could
 not


make
 a
 funny
 movie
 for
 the
 last
 eight


years.
 Like
 it
 was
 impossible.
 It
 was


way
 too
 risky.
 And
 but
 what
 they're


saying
 now
 is
 that
 you
 can.
 And
 then


maybe
 the
 other
 signal
 indicator,


Katherine,
 of
 what's
 happening,
 which
 is


Mel
 Gibson
 finally
 got
 green
 lit
 to
 do


his
 sequel
 to
 um
 Passion
 to
 the
 Christ,


which
 is
 the
 resurrection
 movie,
 and


which
 he's
 which
 he's
 making
 right
 now.


Uh
 at
 least
 my
 friends
 in
 Hollywood
 are


like,
 "Yeah,
 that
 never
 would
 have


happened."
 Um
 like
 that
 never
 would
 have


happened
 under
 a
 Kamla
 administration.


That
 never
 would
 have
 happened
 without


the
 election
 result.
 And
 again,
 it's


these
 are
 not
 even
 people
 who
 are


proTrump.
 It's
 just
 okay.
 Like
 the


national
 mood
 is
 shifting.
 We're
 not


Yes.
 Mel
 Gibson
 of
 all
 of
 all
 people


being
 like
 one
 of the
 clearly
 great


filmmakers
 of
 of
 of
 our
 of
 our
 time.
 Um


and
 you
 know
 having
 all
 of
 the
 issues


that
 Mel
 Gibson
 has
 like
 yes
 that
 guy


should
 get
 to
 make
 a
 movie


>> and
 specifically
 that
 guy
 should
 get
 to


make
 that
 movie.


>> Um
 and
 and
 I
 and
 that's
 an
 example
 of


what
 I'm
 talking
 about
 um
 is
 that
 that's


possible
 this
 year
 in
 a
 way
 that
 wasn't


before.
 Well,
 and
 the
 and
 the
 other


thing
 that
 I
 think
 yesterday
 Young


Washington
 came
 out
 the
 the
 trailer


which
 Joel
 Studios
 which
 again
 is
 not


Hollywood,
 it's
 based
 in
 Provo,
 but
 has


proven
 that
 they
 can
 make
 very


successful
 films
 for
 a
 different
 pocket


of
 the
 actually
 likes
 patriotism.
 But
 I


think
 in
 some
 ways
 like
 the
 the
 Top
 Gun


success
 story.
 Yes,
 it's
 nostalgia,
 but


like
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 did
 so
 well
 at
 the


box
 office
 shows
 that
 there
 is
 an


appetite
 for
 totally
 different
 content.


like
 50%
 of
 the
 would
 love
 to
 see
 movies


that
 are
 patriotic
 or
 about
 something


you
 know
 a
 biopic
 in
 history
 that's


really
 interesting
 about
 George


Washington.
 So
 I
 think
 in
 some
 ways
 it's


like
 there's
 there
 is
 sort
 of
 this


business
 case
 too
 of
 wow
 likeif
 you
 know


the
 50%
 of
 the
 country
 that's
 been


starved
 for
 the
 content
 they
 want
 will


actually
 pay
 to
 go
 to
 the
 theater
 and


maybe
 we
 should
 support
 them.


>> Yeah.
 To
 that
 end
 Mark
 do do
 the
 do
 the


executives
 under
 appreciate
 the
 Rotten


Tomatoes
 phenomenon
 or
 just
 how
 distinct


sort
 of
 the
 Yeah.
 with
 the
 critics
 or


even
 their
 own
 staff
 are
 from
 the
 actual


audience.


>> Yeah.
 So
 they
 they
 live
 it.
 They
 they


live
 it.
 And
 so
 like
 I
 said,
 like
 for


the
 last
 eight
 years,
 it's
 basically


been
 a
 reign
 of
 terror.
 Yeah.


>> Um
 because
 the
 these
 critics
 and
 and


like
 who
 the
 people
 these
 critics


represent
 like
 had
 had
 the
 power
 of
 life


and
 death
 over
 people's
 careers.
 Um
 and


then
 they
 know
 the
 critics
 kind
 of
 went


nuts,
 but
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 the
 problem


with,
 you
 know,
 there's
 not
 that
 much


they
 can
 do
 about
 it,
 right?
 The
 the


critics
 the
 critics
 were
 able
 to
 succeed


in
 their
 own
 field.
 Um
 you
 know,
 it's


just
 like
 everything
 else
 that
 happened


in
 media.
 The
 critics
 were
 able
 to


succeed
 in
 their
 own
 field
 by
 kind
 of


going
 arbitrarily
 wild.
 Um,
 and
 then
 you


know
 there
 was
 basically
 there's


basically
 nothing
 that
 if
 you're
 a
 movie


street
 executive
 there's
 really
 nothing


you
 could
 do
 about
 it
 because
 you
 know


what
 do
 you
 do
 about
 it?
 If
 you
 if
 you


ignore
 them
 they
 you
 know
 they
 attack


you.
 If
 you
 engage
 with
 them
 they
 attack


you.
 If
 you
 attack
 them
 they
 attack
 you


back.
 Um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 there's
 been


very
 little
 to
 do
 and
 then
 you
 know
 the


critics
 are
 not
 well
 oh
 okay
 so
 so


that's
 been
 happening
 and
 you
 know
 with


and
 Hollywood
 like
 Silicon
 Valley
 and


like
 every
 other
 industry
 like
 there
 is


insolarity
 to
 it.
 Um,
 and
 so,
 you
 know,


there's
 this
 self-re
 self-reerential


thing.
 And
 so,
 when,
 you
 know,
 when
 the


mood
 when
 when
 sort
 of
 opinion
 shapers,


you
 know,
 move
 against
 you,
 you
 know,
 it


it
 becomes
 a
 it
 becomes
 a
 real
 problem.


And
 in
 Hollywood,
 you
 know,
 people
 get


fired,
 right?
 Like,
 you
 know,
 every


studio
 executive
 kind
 of
 knows
 that
 at


some
 point
 they're
 going
 to
 get
 fired.


People
 get
 fired
 off
 of
 projects
 all
 the


time.
 Um,
 when
 people
 get
 fired,
 by
 the


way,
 off
 of
 projects
 in
 Hollywood,
 like


they
 may
 not,
 you
 know,
 they
 may
 not


eat,
 they
 may
 not
 get
 another
 job
 for
 f,


you
 know,
 for
 two
 years
 or
 five
 years
 or


ever.
 Um,
 and
 so,
 you
 know,
 it's
 it's


it's
 a
 high
 tension
 environment.
 Um,
 and


so,
 yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 they
 don't


understand
 that.
 By
 the
 way,
 I
 also


think
 that,
 you
 know,
 especially
 the


sort
 of,
 you
 know,
 the
 Boomer


executives,
 the
 Gen
 X
 executives,
 you


know,
 they'll
 also
 tell
 you
 the
 same


thing
 you'll
 hear,
 you
 know,
 that
 you


heard
 in
 the
 valley
 and
 in
 Washington


and
 elsewhere,
 which
 is,
 "Wow,
 the
 young


staff
 is
 really
 radicalized,
 right?"
 And


so,
 you
 know,
 so
 they're
 also
 afraid
 of


their
 young
 staff.
 Um,
 and
 then
 by
 the


way,
 you
 know,
 they're,
 you
 know, the


these
 are
 mostly
 public
 companies.


They're
 also
 afraid
 of
 their
 boards.
 The


boards
 are
 afraid
 of
 the
 public


shareholders.
 You
 know,
 the
 public


shareholders
 radicalized.
 And
 so,
 it's
 a


it
 was
 a
 very
 similar
 phenomenon
 to
 what


happened
 in
 tech.
 um
 which
 is
 kind
 of


this
 this
 sort
 of
 collective
 I
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 like
 wildness
 or
 you
 know
 kind
 of


kind
 of
 um
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 this
 this


this
 intensity
 thing
 you
 know
 kind
 of


happened
 and
 and
 and
 then
 it
 really


couldn't
 be
 openly
 discussed
 for
 a
 long


time
 and
 probably
 still
 can't
 like
 they


probably
 still
 really
 can't
 talk
 about


it
 in
 the
 public.
 A
 few
 of
 them
 are


starting
 to
 but
 like
 not
 really.
 So
 for


the
 most
 part
 the
 conversations
 are
 kind


of
 in
 the
 background
 but
 again
 but


against
 that
 it's
 just
 like
 okay
 that


that's
 that's
 broken
 a
 bit
 and
 and
 part


of
 it
 also
 is
 just
 the
 business
 the


business
 um
 you
 know
 the
 kind
 of


business
 aspect
 of
 it
 um
 which
 is
 I
 mean


the
 the
 the
 classic
 is
 you
 know
 the
 big


money
 maker
 in
 Hollywood
 for
 the
 last
 20


years
 has
 been
 superhero
 movies
 um
 and


and
 let's
 just
 say
 coincident
 with
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 message
 is
 the
 you
 know


the
 results
 in
 those
 movies
 collapsed


right
 and
 so
 and
 and
 like
 at
 some
 point


you
 know
 they
 need
 to
 go
 sell
 some
 movie


tickets
 like
 it
 you
 know
 at
 some
 point


they
 need
 to
 deliver
 revenue
 Um
 and
 I


and
 I
 and
 I
 think
 they've
 gotten
 I
 don't


know
 the
 message
 of
 the
 message
 which
 is


you
 know
 if
 if if
 all
 you
 are
 is
 on


board
 with
 the
 social
 trend
 right


especially
 Katherine
 to
 your
 point


especially
 when
 that
 social
 trend
 gets


old
 and
 is
 no
 longer
 you
 know
 aarant


like
 you
 can't
 run
 a
 public
 company


based
 on
 on
 on
 on
 reviews
 right
 it
 it


like
 at
 some
 point
 butts
 do
 have
 to
 show


up
 in
 seats
 um
 and
 so
 I
 I
 think
 that


that's
 also
 kicked
 in
 and
 so
 the
 the


financial
 pressures
 are
 very
 painful


right
 now
 they're
 probably
 not
 helpful
 I


don't know
 the
 financial
 pressures
 in


Hollywood
 are
 are
 it's
 hard
 to
 say


because
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 when
 there's


financial
 pressures
 in
 Hollywood.
 Of


course,
 the
 argument
 is
 fewer
 movies
 get


get
 green
 lit
 and
 then
 and
 then
 the


executives
 become
 more
 risk
 averse
 than


the
 kinds
 of
 movies
 they're
 willing
 to


greenlight.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think
 it
 also
 means


that
 they
 are
 also
 less
 willing
 to


greenlight
 projects
 that
 are
 being
 green


lit
 only
 for
 political
 reasons
 um
 or


only
 for
 social
 cultural
 reasons
 or
 only


out
 of
 a
 sense
 of
 fear.
 Um
 and
 so
 I


don't
 know
 exactly
 how
 that
 balances
 but


hopefully
 um
 hopefully
 things
 get
 u
 more


exciting.
 By
 the
 way,
 of
 course
 the


other
 big
 topic
 in
 Hollywood
 is
 AI.
 Um,


and
 yeah,
 so
 that's
 the,
 you
 know,


that's
 the
 800
 lb
 thing.
 And,
 you
 know,


and
 and
 you
 know,
 to
 their
 credit,


they're,
 you
 know,
 say
 they're
 highly


aware
 of
 it.
 They're
 highly
 alert
 alert


to
 it.
 Um,
 and
 then
 by
 the
 way,
 there


are
 a
 bunch
 of
 filmmakers,
 including


some
 folks
 that
 I
 know
 that
 are
 like


super
 excited.
 Um,
 and
 so
 there
 there


are
 including
 some
 like
 I
 know
 of
 like


two
 like
 a
 triple
 A
 list
 like
 director,


filmmakers,
 you
 know,
 top
 end
 people
 who


are
 like
 very
 excited
 about
 what's


possible.
 Um,
 and
 are
 are
 going
 to
 fully


embrace
 it.
 Um,
 and
 there's
 there's
 a


bunch
 of
 other
 people
 who
 are,
 you
 know,


very
 excited.
 Um,
 and
 so,
 um,
 so
 there


there's
 going
 to
 be
 an
 embrace
 by
 at


least
 part,
 but
 there's
 also
 there's


also,
 you
 know,
 there
 there's
 a
 lot
 of,


you
 know,
 Hollywood
 has
 always
 had
 kind


of
 a
 fear-driven
 reaction
 to
 new


technologies.
 Um,
 and
 there's
 some
 of


that.
 Um,
 and
 then,
 um,
 and
 then
 and


then
 there
 is
 this
 attachment,
 and


Hollywood
 is
 is
 actually
 very
 acute.


There's
 this
 attachment
 of
 like
 AI


politics
 to
 like
 woke
 politics.
 And
 so


if
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 still
 super
 woke,


you're
 also
 like
 super
 anti-AI.
 Um,
 and


there
 are
 these
 like
 basically
 it's


basically
 like
 the
 woke
 activists
 have


picked
 up
 AI
 as
 the
 new
 thing
 that


they're
 going
 to
 agitate
 about.
 Um,
 and


so
 and
 they're
 mounting
 basically


already
 like
 pressure
 campaigns
 on
 the


studios
 to
 like
 basically
 vow
 to
 never


use
 AI.
 And
 at least
 so
 far
 the
 studios


to
 their
 credit
 are
 like
 no,
 we're
 not


going
 to
 do
 that.
 Um,
 like
 we're
 we
 we


you
 know
 the
 studio
 so
 far
 I
 think
 the


studio
 executives
 have
 all
 been


consistent
 which
 is
 like
 look
 we've


always
 used
 technology.
 Um,
 you
 know
 the


the
 movie
 camera
 itself
 is
 technology.


special
 effects
 like
 we've
 we've
 always


used
 technology.
 You
 know,
 video
 tapes,


DVD,
 streaming,
 these
 are
 all


technologies.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 every
 movie


has
 CGI,
 you
 know,
 like
 that's,
 you


know,
 one
 of
 my
 little
 fun
 facts
 about


history
 of
 movies
 is
 Tron.
 Tron
 was
 the


first
 there's
 a
 big
 sequel
 for
 Tron


that's
 out
 this
 week.
 The
 original
 Tron


was
 1988
 um
 from
 from
 Disney
 and
 it
 was


the
 first
 movie
 that
 had
 integrated
 use


of
 computer
 graphics,
 which
 was
 the
 the


big
 thing
 at
 the
 time.
 Um
 and
 um
 and
 as


a
 consequence
 of
 that,
 Tron
 was


disqualified
 from
 the
 Oscars
 um
 because


they
 cheated
 uh
 by
 using
 computer


graphics,
 right?
 Um
 right.
 And
 so
 and


so,
 you
 know,
 to
 go
 from
 the
 that
 world


to
 the
 world
 in
 which
 every
 movie
 has


CGI
 and
 and
 for
 the
 most
 part,
 you
 don't


even
 know
 that
 there's
 CGI
 in
 it.
 You


just
 see
 a
 romantic
 comedy
 and
 they're


using
 CGI
 to
 do
 all
 kinds
 of
 things
 in


it
 and
 you
 don't
 even
 notice
 and
 it's


just
 taken
 completely
 for
 granted.
 And


so
 like
 I
 I
 I
 I
 think
 the
 studios
 the


studios
 I
 think
 understand
 that.
 I
 think


they're
 going
 to
 they're
 going
 to


actually
 embrace
 it
 enthusiastically.


there's
 going
 to
 be
 this
 there's
 going


to
 be
 this
 like
 at
 least
 there's
 an


attempt
 to
 like
 jin
 up
 a
 moral
 panic


around
 it
 um
 and
 try
 to
 you
 know


basically
 keep
 it
 out
 and
 I
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 going
 to
 work
 because
 I
 think


the
 economics
 are
 too
 compelling
 but
 but


anyway
 but
 then
 the
 other
 thing
 with
 AI


is
 of
 course
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 be
 super


helpful
 to
 existing
 filmmakers
 but
 the


other
 thing
 is
 AI
 for
 sure
 and
 we
 you


know
 we
 see
 this
 especially
 in
 this
 last


last
 in
 this
 last
 couple
 weeks
 with
 the


new
 version
 of
 Sora
 um
 and
 a
 lot
 of


these
 other
 new
 things
 that
 are
 coming


out
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 make
 a
 whole
 new
 kind


of
 filmmaker
 possible
 to
 exist
 for
 the


first
 time
 which
 is
 the
 filmmaker
 with


no
 visual
 skill,
 right?
 Or
 access
 to
 a


set
 or
 to
 a
 camera
 or
 to
 actors,
 but


with
 an
 idea.
 Um,
 like
 you
 like
 people


are
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 make,
 you
 know,


it's
 going
 to
 start
 with
 shorts
 and


animated
 things
 and
 so
 forth,
 but
 it's


going
 to
 it's
 going
 to
 work
 its
 way
 up


to
 full
 movies.
 Um,
 and
 so,
 you
 know,


people
 with
 a
 people
 people
 who


otherwise
 would
 be
 limited
 to
 only
 being


novelists
 or
 being
 maybe
 people
 who
 do


graphic
 novels,
 um,
 but
 are
 creative


geniuses,
 um,
 are
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


actually
 make
 full
 movies
 with
 AI.
 And
 I


and
 again
 I
 think
 I
 think
 that's
 a


reason
 for
 like
 profound
 optimism.
 I


think
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 like
 completely


new
 kinds
 of
 you
 know
 basically
 film
 and


entertainment
 from
 people
 who
 otherwise


never
 would
 would
 have
 been
 able
 to
 to


access
 the
 medium
 and
 and
 I
 think
 that


also
 is
 I'm
 very
 positive
 on
 that.


>> Can
 we
 end
 because
 you
 you
 brought
 it
 up


um
 on
 comedy.
 I
 I
 know
 you
 saw
 gun
 or


the
 the
 new
 naked
 gun
 film.
 What
 what


was
 your
 thoughts
 on
 is
 comedy
 working?


Is
 it
 is
 it
 does
 it
 have
 to
 be
 nostalgic


for
 it
 to
 work?
 But
 may
 maybe
 tell
 us
 a


little
 bit
 about
 that
 film
 and
 and


whether
 it's
 a
 a
 reason
 to
 be
 positive


on
 comedies
 in
 the
 future.
 Yeah.
 So,
 I


thought
 Naked
 Naked
 Gun
 I
 thought
 was


actually
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 minor


miracle.
 Um,
 so,
 uh,
 for
 a
 couple
 a


couple
 reasons.
 So,
 one
 is
 look,
 it's


it's
 it's
 a
 sequel
 to
 movies
 from
 like


40
 years
 ago.
 Um,
 and
 so,
 you
 know,
 how


many
 people
 even
 remember
 the
 original


Naked
 Gun
 movies?
 It
 actually
 turns
 out


a
 lot
 of
 people
 do.
 They're
 beloved


movies,
 but
 also
 it
 turns
 out
 like
 you


can
 you
 can
 make
 an
 like
 it's
 it's


great.
 It's
 it's
 a
 great
 comedy.
 It's


like
 a
 fantastic
 comedy.
 It's
 very


funny.
 Um,
 uh,
 it
 wor
 it
 worked.
 It


worked
 commercially.
 It
 worked
 it
 worked


artistically.
 It
 it it
 it
 it
 honored
 the


original
 material,
 but
 it
 was
 also
 like


it
 was
 it
 was
 deliriously
 loopy
 in
 its


own
 way.
 I
 highly
 recommend
 it.
 It's


it's
 it's
 very
 funny.
 Um
 but
 actually,


striking
 to
 that
 point,
 um
 it
 it
 it
 also


like
 like
 Edington,
 it's
 also
 a
 post


message
 movie.
 Um
 and
 and
 and
 this
 is


actually
 and
 maybe
 this
 is
 a
 reason
 for


optimism,
 which
 is
 again
 if
 you
 go
 back


through
 the
 time
 scale,
 like
 that
 thing


was
 green
 lit
 no
 later
 than
 22,
 probably


in
 21.
 So,
 at
 the
 height
 of
 every
 movie


has
 to
 have
 the
 message
 um
 that
 that


movie
 was
 still
 green
 lit
 and
 it
 got
 all


the
 way
 through
 and
 out
 the
 other
 side


and
 there's
 not
 a
 trace
 of
 it
 in
 it.
 Um


and
 so
 like
 it's
 it's
 a
 pure
 it's
 a
 pure


comedy.
 It's
 a
 pure
 it's
 it's
 like
 the


original
 movies.
 It's
 a
 pure
 comedy.


It's
 a
 pure
 absurdist
 uh
 uh
 you
 know


kind
 of
 modern
 three
 studio
 just
 you


know
 style
 comedy.
 Liam
 Niss
 of
 course


plays
 against
 plays
 against
 type
 uh
 and


is
 of
 course
 a
 brilliant
 comedian
 and


just
 kills
 it.
 And
 then
 Pam
 Anderson
 um


you
 know
 the
 the
 great
 icon
 of
 you
 know


1980s
 you
 know
 femininity
 um
 you
 know


it's
 her
 big
 it's
 her
 big
 you
 know


starring
 role
 and
 she
 just
 like


absolutely
 is
 just
 fantastic
 like
 she's


just
 like
 absolutely
 kills
 it.
 She's


hysterical.
 Um
 and
 she's
 just
 like
 and


she's
 just
 like
 there
 as
 a
 person
 and


like
 she's
 not
 you
 know
 she's
 not


wearing
 you
 know
 she's
 just
 like
 you


know
 she's
 she's
 like
 you
 know
 she's


just
 like
 full
 woman
 um
 in
 natural
 form.


Um
 and
 it's
 is
 it's
 it's
 great.
 Um,
 and


you
 know,
 and
 it's,
 you
 know,
 it's
 a


like
 there's
 and
 there's
 there
 there's


no
 there's
 no,
 you
 know,
 there's
 none
 of


the
 casting,
 let's
 say,
 you
 know,


aspects
 that
 that
 kind
 of
 cause


problems.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 there's
 none
 of


the
 there's
 no
 script.
 It's
 just
 it's


just
 like
 an
 extremely
 well
 executed,


like
 it
 very
 easily
 could
 have
 been
 made


in
 2012
 or
 in
 2008
 or
 in
 2002.
 Um,
 no,


look,
 it
 doesn't,
 you
 know,
 it
 doesn't


move
 the
 artistic
 ball
 forward,
 right?


It's
 a
 very
 well
 executed
 example
 of
 a


genre.
 Um,
 but
 it
 but
 it
 is
 a
 movie
 that


it
 was
 it
 was
 somehow
 able
 to
 escape
 all


of
 the
 traps
 that
 all
 of
 these
 other


movies
 have
 gotten
 into.
 Um,
 uh,
 and
 and


was
 able
 to
 make
 it
 out
 and
 to
 be
 a
 big


commercial
 hit
 and
 and
 again,
 I
 think
 I


think
 the
 I
 think
 the
 executives
 are
 are


are
 very
 encouraged
 by
 that.
 Um,
 the


audience
 is
 still
 there
 for
 that.
 I'll


just
 give
 you
 the
 it
 does
 it
 doesn't


really
 have
 any
 like
 racial
 politics
 or


whatever,
 but
 it
 does
 have
 it
 it
 did


have
 one
 thing
 which
 is
 for
 people
 who


haven't
 seen
 it.
 It
 was
 famously
 a
 movie


originally
 that
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 co
 one
 of


the
 major
 stars
 of
 it
 was
 OJ
 Simpson
 um


playing
 a
 character
 named
 Nordberg
 um


who
 got
 into
 all
 kinds
 of
 unlikely


trouble.
 Um
 and
 um
 uh
 so
 they
 do
 this


scene
 where
 I'll
 just
 spoil
 one
 one


thing
 because
 it
 was
 it
 was
 extremely


funny.
 Um
 Liam
 Niss
 so
 Liam
 Niss
 plays


the
 son
 of
 the
 original
 you
 know
 main


main
 guy
 Leslie
 Nielsen
 in
 the
 movie.
 So


Frank
 Frank
 Frank
 Grebin
 and
 then
 and


then
 Leslie
 uh
 Liam
 Niss
 plays
 Frank


Grebin
 Jr.
 And
 then
 uh
 and
 then
 Liam's


sidekick
 plays
 the
 son
 of
 of
 of
 of
 uh
 of


Leslie
 Neil,
 the
 sidekick
 in
 the


original
 movie.
 And
 then
 and
 then
 and


then
 there's
 a
 young
 black
 guy
 on
 the


team.
 Um
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 normally
 in
 a


movie
 it's
 like,
 okay,
 of
 course
 there's


like
 young
 black
 guy
 on
 the
 team,
 but


they
 do
 they
 do
 it
 really
 well,
 which
 is


that
 they've
 got
 the
 out
 in
 the
 out
 in


the
 hallway
 of
 the
 police
 station,
 the


movie,
 they've
 got
 Leslie
 Nielson's


photo
 up
 on
 the
 you
 know,
 he
 passed


away,
 so
 they
 they
 got
 his
 photo
 up
 and


and
 Les
 and
 Liam
 Niss
 does
 this
 thing


where
 he
 like
 kneels
 down
 and
 he's
 like,


"Oh,
 you
 know,
 father,
 I'm
 trying
 to


live
 up
 to
 your,
 you
 know,
 expectations


and
 trying
 to
 be
 a
 great
 police


officer."
 and
 he's
 like
 sobbing
 and


there's
 tears
 and
 you
 know
 next
 to
 it
 is


like
 his
 sidekick
 with
 the
 sidekick's


photo
 and
 he's
 like
 oh
 father
 I
 miss
 you


so
 much
 and
 I
 I
 want
 to
 be
 a
 great
 cop


and
 then
 there's
 you
 know
 the
 the
 black


kid
 and
 he's
 looking
 up
 at
 a
 at
 a
 photo


of
 OJ


and
 he
 just
 and
 he
 just
 look
 at
 the


camera
 and
 he
 just
 goes


>> perfect
 perfection


>> absolutely
 perfect
 yes
 so
 yeah
 comedies


are
 good
 by
 the
 way
 let
 me
 put
 in
 a
 plug


for
 one
 more
 movie
 um
 uh
 if
 either
 You


guys
 seen
 uh
 Fantastic
 4?


>> No,


>> probably
 not.
 Um
 uh
 Fantastic
 4
 is
 the


most
 pro-
 family
 movie
 uh
 in
 Hollywood


since
 I
 can't
 even
 remember.


>> Um
 uh
 Katherine
 in
 particular,
 I
 think


you'll
 be
 astonished.


>> It's
 incredible.


>> Come
 out.


>> What's
 that?


>> Did
 it
 come
 out?


>> It
 came
 out
 this
 summer.
 It
 came
 out


this
 summer.
 It
 came
 out
 this
 summer.


And
 Marvel,
 just
 for
 context,
 it's
 it's


one
 of the
 big
 It's
 one
 of
 the
 new


Marvel
 one
 of
 the
 new
 Marvel
 tentpole


properties.
 Um,
 and
 and
 the
 Marvel
 the


Marvel
 machine,
 you
 know,
 did
 incredibly


well
 from
 like
 Iron
 Man
 in
 2008
 through


Avengers
 Endgame
 and
 like
 whatever
 2020,


but
 for
 the
 last
 five
 years,
 many
 of
 the


big
 Marvel
 projects
 have
 have
 have
 not


done
 well,
 both
 the
 TV
 shows
 and
 the


movies.
 And
 and
 you
 know,
 you
 could


again,
 you
 could
 argue
 different
 reasons


why,
 but
 like
 Critical
 Drinker
 would


tell
 you
 it's
 because
 they
 became


consumed
 by
 the
 message.
 Um,
 Fantastic
 4


is
 it's it's
 it's
 and
 look,
 it's
 like
 a


you
 know,
 it's
 like
 a
 diverse
 cast.
 It's


got
 it's
 got
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 lot
 of


the
 modern
 stuff
 in
 it,
 but
 however,
 and


um
 it's
 like
 it's
 just
 like
 100%
 prof


family
 um
 in
 like
 a
 very
 actually
 quite


deep
 and
 moving
 way.
 Um
 and
 so
 again,


it's
 just
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 wow,


they
 greenlisted
 this
 thing
 in
 20
 and


you
 know,
 maybe
 again
 maybe
 this
 reason


may
 maybe
 I'm
 actually
 too
 too
 cynical.


Maybe
 in
 2022
 they
 already
 real
 the


filmmakers
 already
 realized
 what
 was


happening
 and
 so
 maybe
 they
 actually
 had


like
 their
 own
 version
 of
 the


underground
 movement
 where
 they're
 like


all
 right
 it's
 time
 to
 start
 planting


the
 seeds
 for
 what
 is
 going
 to
 come
 out


of
 this
 whole
 thing
 when
 when
 sort
 of


the
 panic
 subsides.
 Um
 and
 and
 and
 you


could
 say
 like
 Fantastic
 4
 is
 like
 it's


like
 a
 true
 audience
 pleasing


blockbuster
 from
 a
 studio
 that
 has
 been


obsessed
 with
 the
 message
 um
 that
 comes


out
 and
 doesn't
 have
 a
 trace
 of
 it
 in
 it


at
 all.
 Um,
 and
 um,
 and
 and
 furthermore,


it's
 like
 a
 it's
 like
 100%
 above.
 Like


it
 it
 like
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 it's
 like
 it's


not
 I
 mean
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 superhero


movie,
 so
 it's
 not
 like
 a
 political
 I


wouldn't
 say
 it
 has
 like
 political


content,
 per
 se,
 but
 um,
 it's
 like
 it's


like
 100%
 pro
 family
 in
 a
 way
 that's


very
 touching.


>> We'll
 put
 on
 the
 list.


>> Um,
 do
 you
 think
 your
 kids
 will
 love
 it?


Your
 kids
 love
 it.
 I
 took
 my
 10-year-old


and
 like
 he
 was
 like,
 yeah,
 he
 he


doesn't
 he
 doesn't
 react
 emotionally
 to


things,
 but
 he
 was
 like
 as
 close
 to


crying
 in
 a
 movie
 as
 I've
 ever
 seen
 him.


So


>> Wow.
 Do
 do
 you
 think
 Atlas
 Shrugged
 or


the
 Fountain
 Head
 could
 could
 get
 made


today?
 And
 do
 you
 think
 there'd
 be
 an


audience
 for
 it?


>> You
 know,
 it's
 funny.
 Yeah,
 it's
 funny.


It's
 so
 funny.
 Especially
 Atlas
 like


Alice
 Rugr
 has
 become
 Al
 is
 Alice
 Shrug,


you
 know,
 people
 who
 don't
 know,
 it's


the
 sort
 of
 famous
 ran
 novel.
 It's
 kind


of
 her
 most
 successful
 novel.
 Um,
 it


it's
 the
 novel
 that
 basically
 it
 it
 it


clearly
 is
 like
 a
 great
 mythic
 American


novel.
 Like
 it
 clearly
 it
 clearly
 clears


that
 bar
 that
 we
 were
 talking
 about


earlier.
 You
 know,
 it's
 it's
 it
 is
 one


of
 the
 great
 American
 novels.
 Um,
 you


know,
 it's
 it's
 of
 a
 time
 and
 place,


which
 is
 sort
 of
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 sort


of
 1950s,
 but
 it
 it
 it's
 written
 in
 a


way
 that
 can
 be
 kind
 of
 deliberately


timeless.
 It's
 it's
 it's
 actually
 kind


of
 it's
 actually
 interesting
 how
 it's


written
 because
 it
 kind
 of
 it
 it's
 like


obsessed
 with
 railroads
 on
 the
 one
 hand,


which
 makes
 it
 kind
 of
 look
 back
 to
 the


1800s.
 Um,
 but
 it
 also
 it's
 also
 has


like
 science
 fiction
 elements.
 And
 she


kind
 of
 did
 that,
 I
 think,
 deliberately


so
 that
 it
 would
 kind
 of
 have
 this


timeless
 kind
 of
 she's
 really
 talking


about,
 you
 know,
 it's
 a
 movie.
 It's
 a


novel
 as
 the
 great
 novels.
 It's
 a
 novel


about
 people
 and
 the
 behavior
 of
 people.


Um
 uh
 and
 so
 um
 but
 she
 does
 this
 thing


where
 she
 kind
 of
 abstracts
 the
 specific


content
 of
 it
 in
 order
 to
 kind
 of
 try
 to


make
 it
 timeless.
 And
 I
 think
 I
 think
 it


works
 quite
 well.
 Um
 and
 the
 fountain


head
 is
 is
 another
 version
 of
 that.
 The


the
 Atlas
 shrug
 basically
 is
 about
 is


about
 is
 about
 broadly
 is
 about
 it's


about
 it's
 about
 American
 dynamism.
 It's


it's
 American
 dynamism
 the
 movie.
 It's


about
 industrialization
 and
 progress
 and


science
 and
 going
 to
 the
 stars
 and
 like


you
 know
 achieving
 great
 things.
 Um
 and


um
 you
 know
 and
 and and
 the
 shapest


societies
 that
 do
 that.
 Um,
 The
 Fountain


Head
 is
 is
 is
 more
 about,
 I
 would
 say,


artistic
 achievement
 um
 and
 and
 artistic


purity.
 Um,
 uh,
 and
 is
 sort
 of
 similarly


evocative.
 And
 so,
 both
 those
 novels


are,
 you
 know,
 high
 up
 on
 the
 list
 of


novels
 that
 will
 be
 very
 influential,


you
 know,
 in
 a
 100
 years.
 Both
 of
 those


novels
 have
 been
 absolutely
 scathingly


hated
 by
 every,
 you
 know,
 good
 cultural


commentator
 and
 critic
 for
 the
 last,
 you


know,
 basically
 since
 they
 came
 out.


Like
 just
 and
 and
 those
 novels
 are
 just


attacked
 in
 like
 the
 most
 vicious


possible
 terms.
 Um,
 like
 absolutely
 um,


absolutely.
 In
 fact,
 famously,
 famously,


Whitaker
 Chambers,
 the
 reformed


communist,
 reviewed
 uh
 Atlas
 Shrugged


for
 National
 Review
 when
 it
 came
 out
 in


the
 1950s
 and
 he,
 you
 know,
 he
 basically


called
 her
 a
 Nazi.
 Uh
 in
 National


Review,
 Whitaker
 Chambers,
 who
 became


this
 famous
 right-winger,
 basically


calls
 and
 ran
 a
 NI.
 And
 Ran,
 of
 course,


being
 a
 Jewish
 refugee
 from
 Russia.
 Um


he
 he
 said
 he
 said
 the
 novel
 quote
 has


the
 whiff
 of
 the
 gas
 chamber
 about
 it,


right?
 And
 so
 like
 which
 by
 the
 way,
 it


doesn't,
 but
 but
 anyway,
 very
 unfair


unfair.
 Um,
 but
 um,
 but
 anyway,
 it's


like
 it's
 like
 your
 diversion
 to
 the


Rotten
 Tomato
 scores
 of
 the
 of
 the


critics
 versus
 the
 versus
 the
 audience.


Like
 basically
 everybody
 who's
 read


Atlas
 Shrugged
 like
 loves
 it.
 Um,
 and


everybody
 who's
 like
 criticized
 it
 for
 a


living
 just
 [ __ ]
 despises
 it,
 right?


Just
 like
 completely
 despises
 it.
 Um,


and
 so
 and
 and
 what's
 what's
 interesting


about
 it
 and
 maybe
 this
 is
 the


importance
 of
 the
 novel
 is
 to
 your


question
 like
 that
 that
 that
 aspect
 of


it
 has
 lives
 today.
 So
 like
 anybody


today
 who
 anybody
 today
 who
 every
 time


I've
 ever
 talked
 to
 anybody
 who's
 read


Atlas
 Shrugged
 in
 the
 last
 five
 years


and
 they're
 like
 wow
 it's
 like
 the
 novel


about
 the
 world
 we
 live
 in
 like
 it's


it's
 it's
 like
 oh
 I
 know
 that
 guy
 and
 I


know
 that
 guy
 and
 I
 know
 that
 guy
 and


Eric
 knows
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about
 right


like
 these
 are
 all
 people
 right
 like


these
 are
 all
 people
 these
 are
 all


archetypes
 of
 people
 we
 know
 who
 these


people
 are
 we
 know
 what
 they're
 doing


like
 it's
 just
 it's
 amazing
 how


perceptive
 it
 is
 you
 know
 60
 or
 80
 years


later
 like
 how
 how
 how
 primal
 she
 made


it
 that
 it
 has
 that
 relevance
 um
 it
 and


by
 the
 is
 tremendously
 entertaining
 and


it's
 like
 this
 sprawling
 narrative
 and


it's
 these
 incredible
 characters
 and
 so


yeah
 it
 like
 it
 very
 clearly
 ought
 to
 be


a
 three-part
 movie
 or
 you
 know
 at
 a
 at
 a


huge
 budget
 or
 it
 ought
 to
 be
 like
 an
 an


eight
 season
 you
 know
 10
 episode
 80


episode
 total
 you
 know
 lavish
 HBO
 show


or
 something
 but
 like
 the
 cultural
 like


the
 cultural
 overlay
 of
 that
 like
 what


it
 would
 take
 in
 Hollywood
 to
 do
 that


and
 the
 the
 level
 of
 attack
 that
 you


would
 come
 under
 uh
 the
 level
 of


savagery
 that
 you
 would
 encounter
 if


you're
 the
 executive
 or
 the
 actor
 or


whatever
 I
 mean
 it
 would
 it
 would
 be


every
 bit
 as
 intense
 today
 as
 it
 was
 in


the
 1950s
 when
 the
 novel
 came
 out.
 And


so
 like
 like
 that
 would
 be
 the
 great


like
 that
 would
 be
 the
 indication
 that


like
 we're
 in
 a
 like
 really
 different


world.
 I'm
 I've
 talked
 to
 some
 folks
 in


Hollywood
 about
 it.
 They
 they
 they
 all


know
 it.
 They
 all
 understand
 this.
 They


all
 know
 the
 novel.
 You
 know,
 they're


all
 very
 familiar
 with
 it.
 They
 all,
 by


the
 way,
 love
 the
 idea
 of
 of
 of
 doing


things
 that
 have
 pre-existing
 brands
 and


audiences
 built
 in.
 Um
 you
 know,
 because


that
 that
 really
 reduces
 the
 risk.
 But


like
 they
 if
 you
 really
 talk
 about
 it,


they
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 a
 hot
 stove,


you
 know,
 step
 away.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 and


again,
 it's
 very
 striking
 that
 a
 novel


from
 like
 whatever
 1953


>> can
 still
 be
 generating
 the
 hot
 stove


reaction
 in
 2025.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 is


pretty
 amazing.


>> And
 and
 the
 flip
 side
 of
 that
 is
 because


it's
 such
 a
 cult
 classic
 that
 people


would
 come
 out
 and
 drove.
 Like
 it
 would,


you
 know,
 it
 would
 uh
 it
 would
 make
 a


lot
 of
 noise
 in
 a
 good
 way.


>> It
 would
 be,
 you
 know, it
 would
 be
 the


Silicon
 Valley
 version
 of
 the
 Minecraft


movie,
 right?
 Like
 it
 would
 just
 be


like,
 "Yep,
 we're
 all
 going."


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 but
 uh
 you
 know,
 I
 don't
 know.
 Maybe


maybe
 that
 maybe
 it's
 not
 a
 big
 enough


audience
 or
 whatever
 to
 to
 to
 you
 know


big
 maybe
 that's
 not
 a
 big
 enough
 cult


classic
 thing
 but
 like
 it
 but
 by
 the
 way


it
 sells
 like
 the
 you
 know
 it's
 one
 of


the
 bestselling
 novels
 of
 all
 time.
 It


sells
 you
 know
 enormously
 well
 today.
 It


sold
 well
 basically
 since
 it
 came
 out.


Um
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 it
 sells
 it
 sells


far
 better
 you
 know.
 I
 mean
 it's
 one
 of


these
 things
 it
 sells
 it'll
 sell
 far


more
 copies
 this
 year
 than
 any


well-reviewed
 novel
 you
 know
 that
 the


New
 York
 Times
 Book
 Review
 talks
 about.


Right.
 And
 so
 and
 and
 yet
 it
 is
 just


like
 it
 is
 so
 completely
 politically


unacceptable
 that
 it's
 like
 off
 the
 map.


Um
 yeah.
 So
 that
 that
 would
 be
 the


ultimate
 test.
 I
 I
 would
 love
 to
 see
 it


happen.
 I
 I
 yeah
 I
 I
 don't
 know.
 And
 by


the
 way,
 this
 may
 maybe
 maybe
 the
 answer


here
 maybe
 this
 is
 the
 AI,
 right?
 Maybe


the
 answer
 here
 is
 AI.
 Uh
 maybe
 what
 we


need
 is
 AI
 system
 where
 you
 feed
 the


novel
 in
 and
 it
 makes
 the
 movie.
 Um
 you


know
 which
 by
 the
 way
 for
 you
 know
 now


now
 that
 I
 say
 that
 like
 for
 sure
 that's


going
 to
 happen.
 Um
 and
 so
 you
 know


maybe
 that's
 actually
 the
 answer.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 We
 were
 laughing
 uh
 offline


about
 how
 someone
 uh
 was
 using
 Sora
 to


make
 like
 a
 something
 that
 we
 thought


was
 better
 than
 South
 Park
 and
 and
 so


it'll
 be
 interesting
 to
 see
 if
 a
 whole


new
 crop
 of
 filmmaker
 um
 sort
 of
 you


know
 democratizes
 the
 industry
 a
 little


bit
 that
 it's
 not
 just
 Hollywood
 but


it's
 people
 you
 know
 from
 all
 over
 and


studios
 don't
 have
 this
 sort
 of
 um
 you


know
 monopoly
 over
 over
 creation
 of
 of


high
 quality
 stuff.
 So
 yeah
 we'll
 see.


>> Yeah.
 So
 South
 Park
 actually
 let's
 close


closing
 this
 but
 just
 briefly
 on
 South


Park.
 South
 Park
 was
 very
 much
 like
 what


you're
 seeing
 with
 AI
 film
 making
 right


now
 but
 in
 199
 19 1993
 so
 I
 remember


when
 South
 Park
 the
 original
 South
 Park


came
 out
 the
 original
 South
 Park
 came


out
 1993
 and
 it
 was
 significant
 it
 was


the
 first
 internet
 viral
 video
 ever
 um


it
 was
 the
 first
 video
 and
 this
 was
 like


pre-streaming
 preyoutube
 pre
 you
 know


years
 before
 all
 of
 that
 and
 so
 it


literally
 um
 distributed
 at
 the
 time
 as


a
 literally
 it
 was
 a
 quick
 time
 movie
 um


uh
 it
 was
 Apple's
 quicktime
 video
 format


um
 and
 it
 was
 a
 downloadable
 thing
 and


like
 if
 you
 wanted
 to
 download
 it
 on
 a


modem
 you
 had
 to
 like
 leave
 the
 modem
 on


for
 like
 an
 hour
 or
 something
 to
 like


download
 this
 thing
 and
 And
 what
 it
 was


was
 it
 was
 a
 it
 was
 a
 digital
 scan
 of
 a


um
 of
 a
 video
 Christmas
 card.
 So
 there


was
 a
 an
 executive
 in
 Hollywood
 at
 the


time
 that
 wanted
 to
 make
 his
 friends
 a


special
 kind
 of
 Christmas
 card.
 And
 so


he
 hired
 these
 two
 basically
 scrappy


young
 you
 know
 basically
 film
 students


Matt
 Maststone
 and
 Trey
 Parker
 who
 had


no
 credits
 and
 you
 know
 they
 were
 just


you
 know
 kids
 and
 hadn't
 done
 anything


yet.
 And
 he
 hired
 them
 to
 and
 he


basically
 said
 make
 the
 most
 offensive


basically
 like
 three
 minute
 video


Christmas
 card
 you
 could
 possibly


imagine.
 And
 so
 and
 and
 with
 these
 with


these
 kids
 it
 was
 it
 was
 a
 technology
 at


the
 time.
 What
 they
 did
 was
 they


camcorders
 digital
 cam
 digital


camcorders
 are
 brand
 new.
 So
 they
 used


digital
 camcorder
 and
 then
 but
 then
 then


they
 did
 stop
 they
 did
 stopotion.
 They


had
 no
 money
 so
 they
 did
 stopotion


animation
 using
 little
 cardboard
 using


literally
 construction
 paper
 uh


characters.
 And
 so
 the
 reason
 the


characters
 look
 like
 they
 do
 is
 because


literally
 in
 the
 original
 thing
 they


were
 cut
 out
 of
 construction
 paper
 and


they
 were
 literally
 moved
 by
 hand
 frame


to
 frame
 and
 then
 and
 then
 and
 then
 the


two
 kids
 did
 did
 the
 voiceovers.
 But
 it


was
 from
 the
 very
 beginning
 it
 was
 the


same
 characters
 Cartman
 and
 Kyle
 and


Stan
 and
 Kenny,
 right?
 And
 and and
 and


and
 in
 South
 Park,
 which
 is
 the
 town


that
 these
 kids
 grew
 up
 in.
 Um
 and
 then


it
 was
 a
 threeminute
 Christmas
 card
 and


it
 was
 it
 was
 uh
 Santa
 Claus
 versus


Jesus.
 Um
 and
 and
 and
 and
 Santa
 Claus


versus
 Jesus
 and
 ended
 up
 in
 a
 in
 a
 full


kung
 fu
 fight,
 you
 know,
 complete
 with


like
 blood
 and
 like
 body
 parts,
 right?


And
 so
 it
 was
 like
 this
 it
 was
 like,
 you


know,
 max
 it
 was
 intended
 to
 be
 like
 m


maxually
 offensive,
 but
 it
 was
 like
 it


was
 like
 really
 it
 was
 it
 was
 really


funny.
 And
 so
 somebody
 got
 and
 literally


it
 was
 sent
 out
 on
 videotape,
 right?
 B


DVD,
 right?
 So
 sent
 on
 videape
 and


somebody
 actually
 scanned
 the
 videotape,


which
 is
 actually
 hard
 to
 do
 and
 then
 it


it
 went
 super
 viral
 on
 the
 internet
 uh


and
 became
 big.
 And
 so
 it's
 an
 example


of,
 you
 know,
 that
 that
 everything
 I


just
 described,
 the
 camcorder,
 like
 that


that
 was
 the
 the
 AI
 of
 its
 time.
 It
 let


these
 kids
 who
 had
 no
 access
 or
 no


knowledge
 even
 necessarily
 of
 like


traditional
 animation
 production
 methods


to
 do
 this.
 Um,
 by
 the
 way,
 when
 those


kids
 actually
 then
 got
 their
 their
 they


actually,
 you
 know,
 is
 like
 a
 full


studio
 now.
 You
 know,
 it's
 been


tremendously
 financially
 successful.


They
 they
 now
 have
 a
 complete


state-of-the-art
 studio
 production


facility.
 And
 what
 they've
 used
 it
 for


is
 they've
 used
 it
 to
 hyper
 optimize


computer
 models
 of
 the
 optimal


recreation
 of
 the
 aesthetics
 of
 the


construction
 paper.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 watch


South
 Park
 episodes
 today,
 you
 see


actually
 the
 characters
 have
 there's


actually
 a
 depth
 to
 the
 animation
 that


shows
 the
 layers
 of
 the
 construction


paper.
 It's
 all
 produced
 digitally


today,
 but
 like
 they've
 used
 state
 of


air
 digital
 tools
 to
 re
 to
 to


reconstruct
 the
 physics
 of
 construction


paper.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 you
 know,
 30
 years


later.
 Um,
 and
 so
 yeah,
 so
 so
 they
 were


able
 to
 do
 that
 and
 then
 obviously,
 you


know,
 they
 were
 maybe
 the
 maybe
 the
 most


successful
 like
 animation
 duo
 uh
 of
 the


last
 30
 years.
 And
 yeah,
 I
 think
 that


the
 AI
 thing
 is
 we're
 we're
 right
 on
 the


tipping
 point
 um
 of
 that
 and
 and
 to
 your


point
 like
 maybe
 maybe
 we
 actually
 just


saw
 the
 first
 one.
 It's
 it's
 it's
 so
 um


let's
 say
 toxic
 that
 it's
 hard
 to


recommend
 that
 people
 watch
 it.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Um
 uh
 but
 um
 it
 is
 it
 it
 is


it
 is
 a
 it's
 for
 sure
 a
 South
 Park


caliber
 level
 thing
 created
 in
 AI
 by


somebody
 who
 didn't
 use
 any
 of
 the


traditional
 you
 know
 they
 didn't
 use
 any


they
 didn't
 use
 any
 traditional
 you
 know


techniques
 you
 use
 for
 animating


anything
 uh
 it
 was
 created
 entirely
 with


Sorup
 uh
 scene
 by
 scene
 um
 and
 yeah
 it's


it
 just
 as
 a
 as
 a
 as
 a
 as
 a


demonstration
 of
 technology
 it's
 just


it's
 obvious
 that
 that
 moment
 has
 now


arrived
 and
 to
 your
 point
 Eric
 like
 I
 do


think
 for
 example
 I
 think
 there's
 now


actually
 a
 new
 form
 of
 political


propaganda
 Yeah.


>> At
 Lucen
 the
 World,
 which
 is,
 you
 know,


the
 basically
 the
 custom
 produced,
 you


know,
 basically
 South
 Parkish,
 you
 know,


kind
 of,
 you
 know,
 video
 series
 and
 and


AI
 is
 going
 to
 make
 that
 so
 easy
 for


people
 to
 do


>> that.
 You're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do,
 you


know,
 anybody
 in
 any,
 you
 know,
 any


electoral
 race
 is
 going
 to be
 able
 to


hire
 some
 kid
 to,
 you
 know,
 to
 to
 do


things
 like
 this.
 Um,
 and
 so
 it's
 going


to
 be
 like
 this.
 It's
 like,
 I
 don't


know,
 decentralized
 satire
 or
 something


like
 that.


>> And
 so,
 yeah,
 the
 the
 the
 the
 moment
 has


arrived,
 the
 the
 art
 form
 shifts
 again.


>> On
 on
 that
 note,
 we
 got
 to
 let
 you
 go.


Um,
 but
 this
 has
 been
 a
 fantastic


episode
 of
 modering
 the
 situation.


Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 on,
 Mark.


>> All right.
 Fantastic.
 Situation


monitored.
