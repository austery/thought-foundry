um
 I
 decided
 to
 study
 law
 cuz
 I
 thought


you
 know
 law
 is
 for
 clever
 people
 I
 was


a
 clever
 girl
 that's
 what
 I
 wanted
 to
 do


um
 absolutely
 love
 law
 um
 went
 to
 bit
 to


Cambridge
 did
 a
 bit
 of
 English
 law
 that


was
 great
 um
 obviously
 I
 was
 a
 good
 law


student
 I
 was
 a
 good
 girl
 so
 obviously
 I


was
 going
 to
 qualify
 as
 a
 lawyer
 in


Paris
 in
 one
 of
 the
 big
 law
 firms


started
 out
 there
 and
 just
 realized
 it


was
 a
 shot
 it
 was
 definitely
 not


for
 me
 um
 it
 was
 basically
 everything


I'm
 not
 so
 I'm
 a
 bit
 of
 an
 energetic


person
 I
 like
 to
 move
 around
 you
 don't


want
 to
 be
 a
 corporate
 lawyer
 because


you're
 going
 to
 be
 change
 your
 desk
 um
 I


also
 like
 to
 feel
 that
 I
 have
 some
 form


of
 impact
 in
 what
 I'm
 doing
 you
 don't


want
 to
 start
 at
 the
 bottom
 in
 a


corporate
 offer
 so
 basically
 sitting
 in


Paris
 uh
 next
 to
 the


sh
 in
 this
 big
 corporate
 law
 firm


realizing
 that
 was
 not
 exactly
 what
 I


wanted
 to
 do
 I
 start
 to
 think
 a
 bit


about
 obviously
 when
 you're
 in
 this
 kind


of
 situation
 you
 start
 to
 think
 a
 bit


about
 what
 do
 you
 actually
 want
 to
 do


and
 I
 thought
 back
 to
 uh
 this
 great


place
 this
 great
 thing
 that
 I'd
 followed


for
 quite
 some
 time
 uh
 the
 region


Sovereign
 wealth
 fund
 I'll
 on
 that
 and


basically
 in
 20
 back
 in
 2007
 so
 when
 I


was
 in
 my
 first
 year
 of
 law
 I
 remember


reading
 this
 magnificent
 article
 in
 luo


basically
 saying
 that
 you
 know
 the


Norwegian
 people
 are
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


investors
 in
 the
 French
 stock
 market


and
 you
 know
 when
 you're
 a
 Norwegian
 you


read
 that
 you're
 a
 bit
 like
 how
 can
 this


be
 true
 and
 then
 you
 read
 a
 bit
 further


and
 you
 realized
 this
 this
 amazing
 fund


um
 that
 is
 ours
 um
 and
 basically
 so


sitting
 there
 in
 Paris
 I
 was
 like
 maybe


they
 have
 a
 job
 for
 me
 that
 would
 be


great
 um
 applied
 to
 the
 graduate
 program


ended
 up
 being
 the
 first
 one
 who
 was
 non


Finance
 or
 non-eng
 engineering
 taken


into
 the
 program
 which
 they
 told
 me
 when


they
 called
 me
 which
 was
 a
 bit
 so
 you


know
 when
 you're
 being
 told
 oh
 we're


buing
 you
 out
 kind
 of
 as
 the
 first
 non


Finance
 person
 you're
 a
 bit
 like
 oh
 okay


no
 pressure
 there
 um
 so
 started
 in
 MIM


in
 2014
 actually
 I
 started
 in
 Lo
 though


um
 and
 tried
 a
 bit
 of
 corporate


governance
 which
 is
 quite
 related
 to
 law


in
 a
 way
 uh
 but
 then
 got
 moved
 to
 sector


strategies
 the
 investment
 side
 in
 London


and
 just
 have
 stayed
 ever
 since
 um
 so
 I


moved
 up
 you
 can
 see
 I'm
 getting
 bigger


and
 bigger
 so
 hopefully
 towards
 the
 end


I'm
 huge
 um
 but
 basically
 2017
 went
 up


to
 analyst
 and
 then
 in
 the
 Magnificent


Co
 year
 of
 2020
 when
 we
 were
 sitting
 at


home
 I
 started
 my


portfolio
 um
 so
 that's
 been
 a
 long


journey
 um
 and
 a
 journey
 that
 I'm
 still


on
 um
 and
 basically
 every
 day
 I
 jump


around
 and
 you
 know
 get
 to
 have
 an


impact
 get
 to
 be
 energetic
 get
 to
 go
 out


there
 and
 find
 good
 Investments
 so
 I'm


Still
 Loving
 It
 um
 I
 just
 want
 to
 to


okay
 we
 already
 have
 a
 penguin
 that's


good
 um
 I
 just
 want
 to
 talk
 a
 bit
 about


um
 just
 a
 normalist
 day
 so
 basically
 in


when
 you
 when
 you're
 working
 with


markets
 no
 day
 is
 really
 normal
 because


the
 world
 isn't
 normal
 right
 you
 know


the
 the
 morning
 I
 woke
 up
 and
 Russia
 had


invad
 the
 Ukraine
 that
 was
 not
 a
 normal


day
 um
 so
 we
 have
 all
 these
 days
 that


are
 a
 bit
 un
 normal
 but
 I
 would
 say


there
 are
 periods
 which
 are
 more
 like


others
 and
 that's
 basically
 when


companies
 report
 earnings
 so
 that's


basically
 company
 will
 rep
 report


Financial
 um
 results
 four
 times
 a
 year


most
 likely
 and
 those
 obviously
 those


are
 companies
 I'm
 invested
 in
 or
 not


invested
 in
 so
 I
 follow
 them
 quite


closely
 and
 these
 days
 are
 quite
 fullon


and
 I've
 just
 finished
 the
 full
 year


results
 period
 coming
 out
 of
 that
 I
 was


like
 okay
 now
 this
 is
 a
 normal
 day
 I'm


going
 to
 present
 to
 you
 um
 so
 this
 is
 a


normal
 day
 that
 I
 had
 in
 February
 more


or
 less
 so
 I
 woke
 up
 that's
 great
 uh


when
 a
 company
 reports
 it
 tends
 to
 be


before
 Market
 opens
 so
 since
 I'm
 on


London
 time
 if
 it's
 a
 European
 company


that
 will
 be
 before
 uh
 quarter
 past
 8
 in


the
 morning
 uh
 so
 it'
 be
 usually
 be


around
 6:30
 7
 um
 so
 when
 companies


report
 you
 don't
 go
 to
 the
 gym
 you
 don't


do
 morning
 yoga
 you
 kind
 of
 just
 get
 up


and
 you're
 like
 half
 under
 your
 duvet


looking
 at
 what's
 happening
 um
 they
 will


usually
 also
 do
 um
 a
 call
 so
 the
 CEO
 the


CFO
 will
 talk
 about
 their
 results
 so


usually
 you
 would
 listen
 to
 that
 listen


to
 what
 they
 say
 uh
 maybe
 drag
 out
 your


laptop
 at
 7:00
 a.m.
 in
 the
 morning
 under


your
 duvet
 try
 to
 figure
 out
 in
 your


financial
 model
 company
 model
 what
 it


actually
 means
 um
 at
 one
 point
 when


you've
 done
 all
 this
 uh
 you
 actually
 get


yourself
 to
 work
 and
 when
 you
 go
 to
 work


obviously
 the
 first
 thing
 you
 do
 is
 just


browse
 remouse
 to
 just
 check
 if


something
 special
 has
 happened
 in


markets
 I
 should
 be
 aware
 of
 related
 to


my
 investments
 um
 and
 the
 moment
 you


realize
 that's
 not
 happening
 you
 go
 back


to
 your
 earnings
 uh
 you
 also
 look
 at


your
 portfolio
 because
 you
 can't
 control


yourself
 you
 have
 to
 see
 if
 you're


making
 money
 or
 not
 that
 day
 if
 it's


going
 up
 you're
 happy
 if
 it's
 going
 down


you're
 not
 happy
 um
 and
 then
 you


continue
 you
 try
 to
 continue
 because


you're
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 earnings
 so
 you


probably
 have
 a
 CEO
 meeting
 and
 the
 CEO


is
 probably
 coming
 into
 your
 comp
 into


your
 office
 um
 you've
 probably
 already


prepped
 it
 so
 you
 have
 a
 meeting
 either


obviously
 on
 Zoom
 or
 in
 person
 then
 done


meeting


going
 back
 to
 your
 desk
 and
 then
 it's


time
 to
 do
 a
 tiny
 bit
 of
 research
 in


between
 these
 meetings
 so
 most
 likely


you
 will
 browse
 your
 you
 see
 if
 there's


again
 anything's
 happened
 to
 your


companies
 is
 there
 any
 research
 reports


I
 want
 to
 read
 um
 I
 also
 have
 a
 lot
 of


dashboards
 with
 data
 on
 my
 companies
 so


for
 example
 um
 I
 cover
 hotels
 I
 get


credit
 card
 card
 data
 on
 hotels
 so
 do
 I


see
 any
 change
 in
 how
 much
 people
 are


spending
 on
 holiday
 in
 different
 part
 of


the
 world
 maybe
 not
 um
 are
 you
 guys


still
 subscribing
 to
 Netflix
 or
 not
 are


you
 still
 password
 sharing
 or
 not
 U


that's
 kind
 of
 data
 I
 would
 look
 at
 um


and
 then
 obviously
 there
 will
 be
 parts


of
 stuff
 going
 back
 into
 different
 kinds


of
 models
 thinking
 about
 different
 stuff


yeah
 and
 then
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 my


European
 day
 us
 Market's
 open
 and
 then


everything
 turns
 around
 again
 and
 then


at
 one
 point
 you
 kind
 of
 go
 low
 on


battery


um
 and
 that
 will
 be
 the
 time
 where
 I


will
 teams
 Venicia
 and
 go
 like
 hey
 marks


are
 crazy
 do
 you
 want
 a
 coffee
 and
 then


we
 will
 pedal
 off
 um
 and
 have
 a
 bit
 of
 a


coffee
 and
 then
 obviously
 I
 need
 to
 be


back
 to
 my
 desk
 cuz
 the
 company
 that


reported
 today
 most
 likely
 is
 coming
 in


again
 tomorrow
 to
 see
 me
 um
 because


obviously
 as
 as
 big
 shareholders
 of


every
 single
 company
 out
 there
 we
 have


an
 awful
 lot
 of
 meetings
 with
 CEOs
 um
 so


I
 will
 prep
 that
 meeting
 that
 was
 my


coffeee
 um
 then
 I'll
 prep
 the
 meeting


and
 you
 know
 what
 that's
 probably
 a


Swedish
 company
 so
 they'll
 come
 in
 8:00


a.m.
 tomorrow
 into
 my
 office
 and
 this


day
 has
 been
 so
 full
 on
 so
 maybe
 I


should
 just
 get
 out
 of
 there
 go
 to


spinning
 class
 with
 my


pig
 boom


um
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 a
 bit
 about
 just
 the


investment
 process
 I
 run
 and
 kind
 of
 how


what
 we
 call
 the
 investment
 simulator


fits
 into
 fits
 into
 that
 um
 there's


there's
 not
 an
 awful
 lot
 of
 emojis
 on


the
 screen
 so
 it's
 a
 bit
 harder
 maybe
 to


comprehend
 but
 um
 but
 what
 I
 want
 to


talk
 about
 and
 vanisha
 touched
 a
 bit


upon
 it
 but
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 start


of
 any
 investment
 process
 it
 usually


starts
 with
 valuation
 and
 when
 I
 say


valuation
 I
 mean
 what's
 the
 price
 of
 the


stock
 today
 and
 what
 is


expected
 uh
 what's
 the
 expected
 value
 of


that
 stock
 that
 corresponds
 to
 that


price
 and
 that's
 the
 start
 of
 any


investment
 and
 then
 you
 think
 okay
 so


the
 value
 of
 that
 stock
 that
 is
 quoted


today
 is
 is
 that
 correct
 is
 there


something
 there
 that
 I
 can
 research
 or


think
 about
 that
 makes
 me
 think
 that


this
 company
 is
 actually
 worth
 a
 lot


more
 or
 a
 lot
 less
 um
 so
 basically


that's
 when
 you
 start
 kind
 of
 thesis


building
 and
 thesis
 building
 is


basically
 the
 core
 of
 the
 research


process
 it's
 me
 saying
 Netflix
 is


trading
 at
 450
 USD
 um
 do
 I
 think
 it's


worth
 that
 do
 I
 actually
 think
 this


whole
 password
 thing
 is
 actually
 going


to
 work
 out
 really
 great
 for
 them
 and


they're
 going
 to
 bust
 all
 you
 guys
 from


sharing
 and
 they
 going
 to
 earn
 more


money
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 more


valuable
 baby
 right
 um
 and
 how
 I
 can


kind
 of
 go
 about
 that
 is
 I
 can
 talk
 to


the
 company
 um
 I
 can
 talk
 to
 experts
 who


maybe
 people
 who
 worked
 at
 Netflix


before
 who
 can
 talk
 to
 me
 about
 it
 I
 can


actually
 go
 out
 and
 talk
 to
 people
 who


use
 Netflix
 that's
 actually
 quite
 a
 lot


of
 fun
 because
 Netflix
 is
 something


everyone
 uses
 and
 everyone
 can
 tell
 me


about
 how
 annoying
 the
 whole
 password


thing
 has
 been
 lately
 uh
 but
 then
 again


I
 can
 also
 understand
 that
 you
 can't


share
 anymore
 so
 so
 that
 actually
 they


will
 earn
 more
 money


um
 all
 these
 things
 kind
 of
 makes
 me


determine
 whether
 it
 is
 worth
 more
 money


and
 I
 should
 buy
 um
 say
 I
 decide
 to
 buy


Netflix
 uh
 on
 the
 back
 of
 this
 whole


password
 sharing
 thing
 um
 then
 I
 go
 into


what
 I
 would
 consider
 execution
 phase


and
 that's
 kind
 of
 where
 what
 we
 call


the
 investment
 simulator
 comes
 in
 so


execution
 phas
 for
 me
 is
 when
 I
 put


Stephy
 biased
 4
 not
 40
 million
 of


Netflix
 into
 my
 training
 system
 um
 when


I
 put
 that
 into
 the
 trading
 system
 the


investment
 simulator
 will
 have


accumulated
 a
 lot
 of
 data
 of
 how
 I've


traded
 previously
 so
 it
 will
 sometimes


feed
 stuff
 back
 to
 me
 saying
 you
 know


you've
 been
 really
 poor
 at
 trading


Netflix
 before
 or
 you
 know
 um
 Netflix


consensus
 number
 isn't
 actually
 going
 up


or
 it
 will
 tell
 me
 lots
 of
 different


stuff
 that
 will
 pop
 up
 on
 the
 screen
 um


you
 can
 this
 could
 be
 your
 reaction
 to


what
 I've
 been
 trying
 to
 explain
 to
 you


if
 it
 is
 I
 just
 want
 to
 show
 you
 what


the
 investment
 simulator
 or
 my
 trading


system
 looks
 like
 so
 basically
 we
 have


what
 we
 call
 the
 simulation
 that's
 this


is
 not
 my
 portfolio
 by
 the
 way
 I
 don't


trade
 Nintendo
 and
 Ubisoft
 but
 this


would
 be
 the
 the
 companies
 in
 my


portfolio
 I
 would
 have
 different
 weights


on
 them
 and
 then
 for
 example
 I
 would
 put


in
 the
 trade
 I
 would
 say
 oh
 let's
 buy
 3%


of
 my
 portfolio
 in
 PayPal
 that's
 great


company
 um
 and
 then
 before
 I
 actually


click
 buy
 or
 sell
 I
 will
 get
 these


signals
 up
 up
 there
 so
 the
 market


signals
 um
 there
 will
 be
 data
 that
 the


investment
 simulator
 drags
 in
 from


markets
 so
 it
 will
 be
 uh
 is
 there
 a
 high


or
 low
 short
 interest
 is
 there
 a
 lot
 of


investors
 who
 don't
 believe
 this


companies
 have
 been
 shorting
 it
 that's
 a


good
 thing
 for
 me
 to
 know
 um
 the
 best


part
 is
 stole
 the
 PM
 signals
 again


venisha
 might
 have
 touched
 upon
 the
 bias


as
 part
 of
 the
 whole
 puzzle
 this
 is


where
 it
 tells
 me
 that
 I
 have
 biases
 um


and
 obviously
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 tell


yourself
 you
 have
 biases
 uh
 so
 if
 you


data
 or
 a
 machine
 does
 it
 for
 you
 um


that
 is
 quite
 good
 so
 again
 it
 can
 tell


me
 maybe
 I'm
 not
 particularly
 good
 at


what
 we
 call
 off
 Benchmark
 positions
 uh


maybe
 so
 if
 I'm
 not
 maybe
 I
 should
 think


about
 that
 maybe
 I'm
 particularly
 good


at
 big
 orders
 small
 orders
 um
 maybe
 I'm


particularly
 good
 at
 buying
 companies


when
 I've
 had
 a
 meeting
 with
 them
 which


is
 data
 we
 can
 get
 because
 obviously


they
 know
 when
 I've
 had
 a
 meeting
 and


they
 know
 if
 I
 sold
 or
 bought
 after
 that


meeting
 um
 again
 if
 this
 makes
 no
 sense


to
 you
 which
 I
 could
 totally
 understand


because
 this
 looks
 very
 confusing
 and
 I


have
 tons
 of
 uh
 Financial
 words
 up
 there


you're
 very
 welcome
 to
 come
 and
 find
 me


and
 we
 can
 have
 a
 chat
 about
 it
 thank


you
