Hello everyone, I am Anthony
Welcome to my channel
Today's video
Let's talk about a kind of
Internet subculture
It's a diaper narrative
I believe everyone still remembers
In our video on December 21st
Mentioned general studies
It is becoming increasingly popular among young people in China
General academic requirements
Learn to accept and get used to your own ordinariness
Eliminate competition and comparison
Psychological pressure on individuals
But we said
Ordinary learning attempts to eliminate
One's pursuit of transcendence
In exchange for some kind of false reconciliation of the soul
However, general studies itself
Still limited by the logical framework of success studies
It is still the default
The legitimacy of the secular evaluation system is premised on
Therefore, this kind of peace of mind is fragile and false
True reconciliation
It is not about giving up the pursuit of universality and transcendence.
But to realize
Transcendence advocated by mainstream society
Maybe it's just a false transcendence
Therefore, we must pursue true spiritual liberation
It means that we need to touch upon social reality
To criticize and deconstruct those false excellences
Finally, a truly universal evaluation system will be established
at this point
The same applies to many Chinese people's mental phenomena
For example, the Diaosi culture that has been popular in Chinese society for a long time
If ordinary learning is achieved by emphasizing one's own ordinariness
To relieve the pressure brought by success studies
Then the diaosi culture
Through more intense self-deprecation
Self-mockery
To mock and resist mainstream values
Therefore, it has a more far-reaching impact than ordinary studies.
certainly
There is a lot to talk about on this topic
Today's video
Let’s first briefly talk about the evolution of Diaosi culture
If you are interested in today's video
Or you have any idea
Topics for discussion and consultation with me
You can contact my email to make an appointment
Let's get back to our topic today.
First of all, let’s talk about Diaosi culture
Refers to such an online subculture:
Individuals use negative, derogatory
Even insulting names
As a symbol of self-referentiality and self-naming
With these symbols
People established
A subculture space that is separate from mainstream culture
And through constant self-deprecation on the Internet
To achieve catharsis and carnival
Diaosi culture can be traced back to 2011
Baidu Tieba's Li Yi Bar
In the online war of words at that time
Other netizens coined the term “diaosi”
This insulting name
Come and attack Li Yi's members
But the members of Li Yi Bar
But he gladly accepted it
And call myself a diaosi
Not only that
They also created or summarized a series of
Highly related Internet slang
For example, "fat and round" and "short, ugly and poor"
"Tall, rich and handsome" and "goddess" etc.
In the symbolic system represented by Diaosi culture
The whole society is exaggeratedly divided into
Two groups that are clearly divided into two opposite groups
Economic class
Physical characteristics
Closely integrated
The powerful class is beautiful and rich
The disadvantaged class are short, poor and ugly.
Because this symbol system is simple and crude
But it's very empty
On the contrary, it can arouse
Chinese netizens generally have
Relative deprivation and weakness
More and more netizens call themselves "diaosi"
In this weird self-mockery
And grassroots black humor
Diaosi culture quickly became popular
Even became
An underlying logic of various online subcultures in China
Judging from the various popular online memes in recent years
We can observe a common pattern:
The individual, in a self-deprecating, self-surrendering
Mental failure method to express yourself
Powerlessness and dilemma in social structures
Gaining a brief emotional catharsis and identity recognition at the same time
For example, in recent years, the test-takers and workers
Rats, cows, horses, NPCs, etc.
NPC originally refers to the
Game characters that are not controlled by the player
These characters are different players all day long
Saying the same words
Doing the same action
Serve the game plot and players as a supporting role
Later it was extended to mean worthless and insignificant.
People whose lives are monotonous
For example, some netizens said
My daily life is boring
It's all in the process
But like an NPC, you must be on call at any time
Everyone started to question the NPC
After being beaten, I understood the NPC
Inevitably become an NPC in the end
Similar to Diaosi culture
NPC culture uses game metaphors
Expresses the individual's response to mechanization,
Programmatic and instrumental dissatisfaction
Another popular internet term: "Test-taker"
This reflects more on the students of China's famous universities.
The structure and humor of the college entrance examination narrative after the reform and opening up
The term "test-taker" originally referred to
Good at getting high scores in China's exam-oriented education system
But people who lack social skills
This is obvious
It is also an insulting and sarcastic name.
But more and more Chinese college students
Call yourself this
Joined this self-deprecating ritual
In 2020, the Douban group "985 Waste Import Plan" was established
Most of the team members graduated from famous Chinese universities
But they all call themselves trash, test-takers
"Waste" is a homophone of "five"
If the test taker
Expresses the deconstruction and ridicule of the college entrance examination narrative
Then the "small town test-taker"
Then attached
Hidden dissatisfaction with rural-urban inequality
And my efforts to pass the college entrance examination
Getting rid of the frustration of being a small town person
for
Many students come from small towns or rural areas
The college entrance examination is often seen as the only way to change one's destiny.
However
This path was adopted in the early days of reform and opening up.
Might have brought some fair chances
However, at the moment
Many people feel
Even if I stand out in the college entrance examination
Out of town
Still aware of family background and urban-rural gaps
Impact on personal growth
As Anne LaRue, a sociology professor in the United States
In "Unequal Childhoods":
The American middle class,
Working class and poor families
Different ways of raising children
Middle-class families adopt collaborative education
It manifests itself in the daily lives of family members
Use language extensively for reasoning and conversation
This not only greatly improves children's vocabulary
It also helps children become familiar with
How to deal with adults
As a result, children are more likely to
Put yourself on an equal footing with adults
and often judge the adults around them
This ability
Easier to gain recognition from mainstream American society
and become a popular cultural capital
Working class families or poor families
It is easier to adopt a natural growth strategy
Within these families
There are usually no long discussions, consultations, or dialogues.
The words are relatively short and simple
Language is just a
Practical skills for everyday life
Rather than cultivating reasoning and abstract thinking
Therefore, children from working class families
More likely to have a relatively relaxed and leisurely childhood
Although
The social environments in the United States and China are very different
For example, middle-class families in China
There is no emphasis on dialogue and reasoning.
Workers and poor families
Children do not have a leisurely and relaxed childhood
But the disadvantaged groups
A state of being excluded by mainstream rules and order
are interlinked
for example
Children from poor families in the United States
When you grow up, you will feel a sense of embarrassment.
Feeling that you are not good at negotiating and communicating with others
and the ability to express one's ideas clearly
This is different from many students who call themselves small town test-takers.
To the original family
And reflections on my own social phobia, sensitivity, and inferiority complex
is similar
Due to the universality of this phenomenon
The joke about the test-taker quickly became popular
Including a large number of college students from non-famous universities
Also started using "QuestionMaster"
As one's own identity
If we talk about the joke of the test-taker
It reflects the sense of powerlessness towards the involution of the education system.
So the two words "working people" and "cows and horses"
It mainly refers to workplace oppression
The original meaning of "working" refers to physical labor, hard work
The knowledge and skills that white-collar workers engage in
Office work
There is a sharp contrast
But playing the working man joke on the Internet
It is mainly white-collar workers
Rather than those
Workers who really do heavy physical labor
There is a deliberate degradation and deconstruction here.
In China
Many companies and bosses will use various methods
To emphasize the beauty of the work itself
and sacred meaning
Emphasize the professionalism, professionalism and importance of the work content
And use this to require employees to have elite consciousness,
Ownership
You need to have a sense of mission and belonging to the company.
At the same time, those employees who do not agree with this culture
Defined as not striving for progress
Lack of vision and fighting spirit
The "working people" stalk is
Completely stripped of these packaging and attached halos
Make your white-collar job
Equated with repetitive and boring hard work
To satirize the mechanical, meaningless and exploitative nature of labor
And call themselves "cow horses"
It is a profound self-mockery
That is to say, it implies that one is being objectified in the workplace.
Alienation and Dehumanization
Seen only as a tool to get the job done
Another more abstract
Even more insulting is calling yourself "rat"
Some netizens compared themselves to mice.
Can only live in a dark corner
My parents are rat dad and rat mom
Mouse Literature
Usually starts with the sentence "Mouse, I am"
Expressing the state of being destroyed by life
for example
A netizen said
I worked hard and got into a second-tier university.
But relatives still look down on Shushu
Some netizens also said
I was exploited by my boss during my internship.
Can't find a good job
Let the rat parents be disappointed
With the test taker
This name is limited to the field of education.
The name "rat" is more vague
The pain it refers to is also more widespread.
It can call itself
It can also be extended to people who are close to you.
For example, parents
therefore
"Rat" often implies the younger generation
The powerlessness and painful experiences shared with parents
It is also a kind of intergenerational pain.
Metaphor of identity dilemma and social oppression
Through the above discussion
We can see
Over the past decade
Diaosi literature is not dead
Instead, it has been greatly developed and spread
At first, the term "Diaosi"
Just an all-encompassing self-deprecating label
No distinction has been made between different areas of pain
As China's social involution intensifies
Diaosi narrative in the workplace, education,
Original family and other fields
A more refined differentiation
Demonstrated its great vitality
Faced with these deconstructions and jokes
There are two main responses from the mainstream order.
First, direct suppression and preaching
The second is to appease, beautify and incorporate
for example
People's Daily Online: "Small town test-takers are also extraordinary"
Then he said:
“Small town test-taker” is definitely not a self-deprecating term!
It is more like a belief of most young people.
An affirmation of "knowledge changes destiny"
It is today's society
Every "ordinary person" who desires to change his fate
Synonyms for
Everyone who pursues their dreams should be encouraged
Rather than being ridiculed
Not all stars like to hang in the night sky
Not all rivers flow to the sea
The word "success"
In the 21st century, China has never been "defined"
This official rhetoric
On the surface, it affirms the self-improvement spirit of the individual
But in fact
It is a rather false and cold positivity.
Through sentimental and poetic language
The official reality of the individual
Packaged as a romanticized struggle story
Create an illusion of warmth
Without touching at all
The root causes of these difficulties and social contradictions
Another example is this article from Beijing Youth Daily
"Behind the self-deprecation of workers lies tenacity and struggle"
Also said:
It’s a good thing for young people to complain about their workplace
Realize that we are all workers
Helps eliminate professional contempt chain
Don't look down on anyone.
This shows that professional prejudice is slowly disappearing
This is complete nonsense.
The official hopes
The forces of resistance and criticism
Transformed into an entertainment
Even positive energy
However, fundamentally
Diaosi Narrative
Indeed, I do not have insight
and the ability to deconstruct official discourse
after all
A person has admitted that he is a loser.
Acquiescing to the authority of the secular system
It will be more difficult for him to have strength and confidence
To deconstruct those things that permeate education,
Ideology in the media and policy
So we say
This self-deprecating carnival
Although there is some resistance
But this resistance should not be overestimated.
It just stops at some kind of emotional catharsis.
Therefore, it is easy to be
The mainstream order is incorporated, utilized and transformed
Become a harmless existence that does not touch the structure
We will continue to discuss this topic in the next episode.
