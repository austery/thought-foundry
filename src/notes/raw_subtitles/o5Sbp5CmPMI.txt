wow
 what
 a
 what
 an
 exciting
 year
 and
 we


are
 really
 pleased
 to
 uh
 tell
 you
 about


the
 results
 uh
 for
 last
 year
 um
 it
 was
 a


very
 uh
 strong
 uh
 year
 for
 the


fund
 uh
 we
 were
 up
 uh


133%
 and
 so
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 very
 strong


years
 and
 given
 the
 size
 uh
 of
 the
 fund


in
 terms
 of
 absolute
 uh
 increase
 in


value
 it
 was
 the
 largest
 on
 uh
 record


yeah
 so
 that's
 the
 returns
 we
 also
 have


had
 inflows
 last
 year
 uh
 albe
 it
 as
 not


as
 much
 as
 in
 22
 and
 23
 still
 for
 more


than
 400
 billion
 croners
 is
 the
 third


highest
 inflow
 we
 ever
 seen
 into
 the


fund
 and
 so
 if
 you
 put
 the
 different


drivers
 together
 the
 returns
 of
 more


than
 2,500
 billion
 the
 400
 billion
 plus


in
 inflows
 and
 add
 to
 that
 the
 change
 in


the
 croner
 value
 which
 makes
 the
 fund


look
 bigger
 in
 croners
 the
 fund
 had
 a


change
 in
 market
 value
 almost
 4,000


billion
 chers
 the
 biggest
 ever
 M
 now
 we


it
 doesn't
 always
 grow
 to
 to
 the
 top


yeah
 no
 um
 we
 just
 want
 to
 uh
 warn
 again


that
 uh
 this
 will
 uh
 not
 last
 forever
 we


are
 today
 out
 with
 the
 stress
 tests
 and


uh
 which
 are
 on
 our
 website
 we
 have


different
 types
 of
 scenarios
 and
 we
 laid


out
 the
 assumptions
 Behind
 these
 tests


and
 we
 think
 in
 in
 several
 of
 the


scenarios
 we'll
 have
 very
 very


significant
 uh
 decline
 in
 the
 value
 of


the
 fund


yeah
 we
 also
 just
 want
 to
 remind


everyone
 that
 you
 know
 a
 part
 of
 the


returns
 that
 we
 collect
 is
 also
 actual


uh
 cash
 returns
 dividends
 from
 our


Equity
 Investments
 coupons
 on
 our
 bonds


rents
 from
 our
 real
 estate
 Investments


and
 so
 uh
 last
 year
 we
 had
 almost
 400


billion
 croners
 cash
 return
 into
 the


fund
 now
 whilst
 uh
 the
 absolute
 um


return
 was
 strong
 the
 relative
 return
 uh


was
 not
 uh
 we
 were
 45
 basis
 points


behind
 uh
 the
 reference
 index
 which
 is


the
 third
 uh
 worst
 year
 in
 uh
 in


percentage
 terms
 um
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at


where
 that
 comes
 from
 and
 we'll
 spend
 a


bit
 of
 time
 on


this
 Market
 exposure
 is
 where
 we
 are


really
 index
 near
 in
 our
 um
 asset


management
 and
 then
 you
 have
 security


selection
 which
 is
 a
 stock
 picking
 those


two
 kind
 of
 pretty
 much
 canceled
 out


last
 year
 then
 we
 have
 two
 other


elements
 uh
 totaling
 45
 basis
 points


real
 assets
 is
 our
 real
 estate
 holdings


and
 the
 way
 we
 report
 the
 relative


result
 is
 that
 we
 report
 uh
 uh
 the
 value


of
 the
 real
 estate
 relative
 to
 what
 we


would
 have
 made
 if
 those
 if
 that
 uh


value
 was
 invested
 in
 a
 combination
 of


stocks
 and


bonds
 um
 the
 value
 of
 uh
 real
 estate
 was


roughly
 flat
 but
 since
 the
 stock
 market


went
 up
 so
 much
 there
 is
 a
 negative


result
 there
 of
 25
 basis
 points
 the
 20


basis
 points
 on
 allocation
 uh
 consists


of
 two
 things
 we
 had
 an
 underweight
 in


equities
 and
 we
 also
 had
 an
 underweight


in
 the
 uh
 in
 the
 largest
 tech
 companies


in
 the
 US
 so
 that's
 uh
 the
 45
 basis


points
 we
 have
 to
 look
 at
 uh
 the
 rity


performance
 uh
 in
 the
 longer
 term
 uh


time
 Horizon
 uh
 we've
 had
 some
 strong


periods
 we've
 had
 a
 weak
 period
 now
 for


two
 years
 but
 still
 since
 the
 Inception


of
 the
 fund
 the
 access
 returns
 have
 been


25
 basis
 points
 per


year
 so
 different
 asset
 classes


absolutely
 so
 the
 fund
 is
 invested
 in


four
 asset
 classes
 as
 you
 see
 on
 this
 uh


chart
 equities
 fixed
 income
 real
 estate


and
 infrastructure
 for
 renewable
 energy


and
 the
 return
 on
 each
 asset
 class
 you


can
 also
 see
 with
 equities
 uh


outperforming
 the
 other
 asset
 classes


significantly
 18%
 is
 a
 very
 very
 strong


year
 so
 uh
 we'll
 go
 through
 each
 of


these
 asset
 classes
 in
 turn
 and
 explain


what
 the
 main
 drivers
 were
 equities


first
 remind
 everyone
 this
 is
 uh
 the


largest
 asset
 class
 More
 than
 70%
 the


starting
 point
 is
 70%
 invested
 in


equities
 and
 20%
 return
 on
 that
 almost


is
 is
 the
 biggest
 driver
 behind
 the
 the


funds
 return
 this
 year
 now
 there
 has


been
 differences
 across
 markets
 uh
 in


particular
 we've
 seen
 a
 very
 strong


performance
 in
 the
 US
 market
 and
 here


you
 see
 the
 US
 market
 in
 light
 blue
 and


you
 see
 the
 European
 broad
 Market
 in
 the


more
 orange
 color
 and
 what
 you
 can
 see


is
 also
 that
 this
 uh
 difference
 uh


became
 much
 more
 apparent
 uh
 through
 the


election
 and
 after
 the
 election
 this
 is


still
 a
 long-term
 Trend
 that
 we've
 been


seeing
 uh
 over
 the
 past
 10
 years
 we've


seen
 the
 US
 Equity
 Market
 significantly


outperforming
 the
 European
 market
 uh
 by


magnitude
 of
 almost
 three
 times
 over
 the


last
 10
 years
 now
 this
 is
 also
 of
 course


driven
 by
 different
 sector
 composition


in
 the
 different
 regions
 absolutely
 and


we
 saw
 that
 uh
 last
 year
 as
 well


technology
 uh
 really
 really
 strong
 of


course
 driven
 by
 uh
 AI
 related
 stocks


mainly
 also
 financials
 were
 very
 strong


and
 it's
 a
 combination
 of
 interest
 rate


Staying
 High
 high
 for
 longer
 and
 also
 a


steepening
 of
 the
 curb
 since
 a
 lot
 of


banks
 finance
 themselves
 in
 the
 short


end
 and
 lend
 in
 the
 long
 run
 that's
 a


very
 profitable
 uh
 positioning
 to


have
 if
 you
 look
 at
 then
 the
 impact
 on


the
 sectors
 uh
 uh
 massive
 gains
 from


technology
 more
 than
 1,000
 billion


Corner
 uh
 just
 incredible
 returns
 um
 on


a
 stock
 specific
 basis
 you
 see
 Nvidia
 uh


being
 the
 biggest
 gainer
 for
 us
 uh
 it


became
 the
 largest
 company
 in
 the
 world


uh
 last
 year
 uh
 followed
 by
 big
 returns


from
 Apple
 and
 uh
 the
 other
 uh
 super


scalers
 and
 technology


companies
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies
 are


tied
 into
 the
 same
 value
 chain
 so
 Nvidia


designs
 the
 chips
 it's
 being
 produced
 in


Taiwan
 it's
 being
 sold
 to
 the
 large


large
 tech
 companies
 and
 you
 see
 it
 on
 a


day
 like
 Monday
 earlier
 this
 week
 what


the
 impact
 can
 be
 when
 uh
 when
 you
 have


a
 a
 correction
 which
 is
 related
 to
 this


uh
 value


chain
 um
 now
 many
 of
 these
 companies
 are


now
 bigger
 than
 countries
 they
 are
 so


let's
 put
 it
 into
 perspective
 this
 is


our
 portfolio
 single
 name
 companies
 the


biggest
 ones
 compared
 to
 our
 combined


investments
 in
 selected
 countries
 and


what
 you
 can
 see
 is
 you
 know
 the
 likes


of
 Apple
 Microsoft
 Nvidia
 you
 know
 our


Holdings
 in
 those
 companies
 are
 larger


than
 our
 combined
 Holdings
 in
 for


example
 Germany
 France
 or
 even
 India
 so


these
 are
 massive
 companies
 which
 means


that
 there
 is
 an
 increasing


concentration
 risk
 in
 the
 equity
 markets


and
 hence
 in
 our
 portfolio
 this
 graph


shows
 you
 how
 how
 much
 that


concentration
 for
 the
 top
 10
 Holdings


has
 gone
 from
 uh
 roughly
 8%
 back
 in
 2017


and
 now
 is
 uh
 nearing
 20%
 of
 our
 Equity


portfolio
 in
 only
 10


Holdings
 now
 part
 of
 the
 story
 behind


this
 is
 of
 course
 the
 merger
 an


acquisition
 that
 goes
 on
 on
 the
 exchange


but
 there
 is
 also
 a
 long-term
 Trend
 that


we
 have
 talked
 about
 previously
 where


companies
 uh
 choose
 not
 to
 list


themselves
 and
 stay
 private
 uh
 for


longer
 so
 this
 shows
 you
 over
 the
 last


well
 20
 years
 plus
 uh
 how
 the
 number
 of


listed
 companies
 in
 the
 US
 has
 fallen


from
 almost
 7,000
 to


4,500
 and
 by
 the
 same
 time
 uh
 the


privately
 owned
 companies
 has
 grown
 from


2,000
 to
 almost
 uh
 12,000
 or
 more
 than


11,000
 so
 um
 this
 is
 uh
 this
 is


absolutely
 significant
 and
 of
 course


what
 we're
 talking
 about
 here
 is
 uh
 the


technology
 sector
 n
 yeah
 absolutely
 um
 a


lot
 of
 things
 been
 going
 on
 in
 the
 uh
 in


the
 tech
 sector
 and
 to
 shed
 some
 light


on
 this
 we
 have
 uh
 woken
 up
 our
 uh


portfolio
 manager
 uh
 Doug
 shell
 um
 Doug


uh
 you
 are
 live
 from
 New
 York
 what's
 the


reason
 behind
 the
 strong
 performance


here
 hi
 Nikolai
 well
 for
 the
 second
 year


uh
 AI
 has
 been
 the
 main
 driver
 of
 tech


performance
 uh
 but
 this
 time
 with
 much


more
 dispersion
 and
 returns
 in
 the


semiconductor
 sub
 sector
 uh
 in
 2023


almost
 all
 the
 companies
 perform
 well


while
 in
 the
 past
 year
 overall


performance
 was
 great
 despite
 many
 of


the
 semi
 names
 being
 flat
 to
 down


returns
 were
 driven
 by
 only
 a
 few
 stocks


such
 as
 Nvidia
 which
 on
 its
 own


increased
 in
 value
 by
 something
 like
 25


trillion
 croner
 not
 due
 to
 multiple


expansion
 but
 due
 to
 extraordinary


earnings
 growth
 there
 was
 as
 a
 result
 of


huge
 AI
 chip
 demand
 AI
 also
 drove


earnings
 for
 a
 number
 of
 other
 Mega
 cap


tech
 stocks
 such
 as
 meta
 and
 Google
 you


used
 AI
 chips
 to
 power
 really
 incredible


advertising
 tools
 these
 AI
 tools
 are


able
 to
 automate
 every
 part
 of
 an
 ad


campaign
 from
 actually
 creating
 the
 ads


to
 choosing
 uh
 who
 to
 show
 the
 ads
 to
 to


decide
 where
 to
 place
 them
 whether


that's
 on
 search
 or
 video
 or
 feed
 if
 you


run
 a
 small
 business
 having
 an
 AI
 tool


run
 your
 ad
 campaign
 uh
 while
 gener


ating
 more
 sales
 for
 you
 at
 a
 lower
 cost


as
 a
 game
 changer
 and
 one
 that
 drove


strong
 sales
 for
 meta
 or


Google
 and
 what
 do
 you
 see
 uh
 going


forward


here
 well
 investors
 do
 have
 high


expectations
 for
 Mega
 cap
 tech
 stocks
 in


2025
 which
 is
 definitely
 a
 less


comfortable
 place
 to
 be
 in
 order
 to


continue
 their
 success
 tech
 companies


will
 have
 to
 continue
 to
 invent
 new


products
 and
 services
 that
 their


customers
 are
 willing
 to
 pay
 for
 if


there's
 an
 area
 that
 could
 surprise
 in


2025
 it
 could
 be
 AI
 in
 the
 physical


world


one
 example
 are
 robot
 taxis
 which
 became


widely
 available
 in
 San
 Francisco
 and
 LA


in
 2024
 but
 could
 be
 rolled
 out
 far
 more


widely
 the
 transportation
 sector
 is
 an


enormous
 industry
 so
 robot
 taxis


represented
 huge
 opportunities
 for


companies
 including
 Tesla
 Google
 and


Amazon
 very
 good
 um
 big
 thank
 you
 um
 and


um
 we
 are
 moving
 on
 to
 external
 managers


you
 know
 we
 have
 roughly
 5%
 of
 the
 fund


which
 is
 outsourced
 to
 external
 man


managers
 it's
 been
 a
 very
 very


profitable
 uh
 part
 of
 the
 firm
 and
 we'll


hear
 from
 um
 Isabel
 why
 uh
 this
 has
 been


uh
 so


strong
 you
 we
 need
 a
 bit
 of
 sound
 from


you
 sorry
 about
 that
 yeah
 you're
 right


so
 2024
 has
 been
 another
 successful
 year


for
 our
 external
 fund
 managers
 who
 once


again
 generated
 excess
 returns
 and
 this


is
 thanks
 to
 our
 14
 locally
 based
 fund


managers
 spread
 across
 50
 different


cities
 all
 over
 the


world
 and
 I
 do
 think
 that
 there
 are


sever
 reasons
 as
 for
 why
 they
 keep
 on


outperforming
 first
 of
 all
 through
 deep


company
 analysis
 local
 expertise
 and


extensive
 on
 the
 ground
 research


capabilities
 they
 have
 been
 able
 to


select
 the
 right


Investments
 but
 also
 kind
 of
 being
 close


to
 companies
 and
 their
 supply
 chains
 has


kind
 of
 enabled
 them
 to
 generate


exceptional
 returns
 by
 identifying


Trends
 early
 and
 often
 before
 these


opportunities
 become
 wildly
 recognized


by
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 market
 what
 are
 some


of
 the
 events
 you've
 seen
 on
 the
 last


year
 well
 so
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 exciting


things
 happening
 but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 one


of
 the
 markets
 that
 we
 are
 most
 excited


about
 is
 India
 we
 now
 have
 a
 total
 of


seven
 managers
 based
 locally
 here
 both


in
 Mumbai
 and
 Delhi
 and
 they've
 been


able
 to
 generate
 excess
 return
 in
 a
 very


challenging
 Market
 they've
 steered


cleared
 of
 these
 very
 expensive
 smaller


companies
 that
 we
 saw
 a
 lot
 of
 in
 2024


and
 rather
 focused
 on
 larger
 Quality


Companies
 which
 has
 been
 very
 beneficial


for
 our


portfolio
 and
 I
 also
 think
 that
 India
 in


general
 has
 shown
 quite
 impressive


resilience
 and
 of
 course
 remarkable


growth
 over
 the
 past
 40
 years
 and
 this


is
 despite
 various
 political
 and


economical
 challenges
 and
 looking
 ahead


we
 do
 expect
 this
 growth
 to
 continue


mainly
 driven
 by
 a
 young
 and
 growing


Workforce
 but
 we
 also
 think
 that
 this


growth
 could
 increase
 even
 further
 with


government
 support
 and
 more


infrastructure


Investments
 so
 this
 is
 definitely
 a


market
 that's
 been
 very
 exciting
 to


follow
 for
 2024
 and
 we're
 just
 as


excited
 for
 2025
 very
 good
 thanks
 a
 lot


um
 now
 uh
 TR
 fixed
 income
 fixed
 income


uh
 the
 second
 biggest
 asset
 class
 um


well
 almost
 30%
 invested
 in
 fixed
 income


globally
 uh
 the
 return
 was
 1%
 uh
 the


yield
 on
 the
 portfolio
 the
 running
 yield


is
 4%
 so
 that
 means
 that
 interest
 rates


through
 the
 year
 actually
 increased
 and


hence
 the
 bond
 prices
 fell
 the
 other


feature
 of
 the
 market
 and
 here
 you
 can


see
 the
 the
 most
 important
 interest
 rate


in
 the
 world
 arguably
 uh
 the
 US
 Treasury


10
 year
 uh
 was
 volatile
 that's
 the


that's
 a
 key
 takeaway
 from
 2024
 but
 to


shed
 more
 light
 on
 that
 we
 want
 to
 have


and
 bring
 in
 Maly
 nberg
 uh
 so
 she's
 in


New
 York
 now
 she's
 in
 the
 leader
 group


we're
 a
 global
 organization
 and
 we
 have


a
 permanent
 Pres
 sorry
 a
 PE
 person
 from


The
 Leader
 group
 also
 in
 in
 New
 York
 and


that's
 a
 good
 thing
 uh
 so
 Molin
 good
 to


see
 you
 um
 what
 can
 you
 say
 about
 what's


your
 impression
 of
 the
 fixed
 inco


markets
 last


year
 hi
 John
 so
 I
 would
 say
 that
 2024


was
 a
 surprising
 year
 for
 bonds
 so
 going


into
 the
 year
 most
 Market
 participants


were
 expecting
 inflation
 to
 finally
 be


under
 control
 rate
 cuts
 from
 central


banks
 and
 predicting
 this
 would
 be
 a


great
 year
 for
 bonds
 however
 most


Government
 Bond
 markets
 ended
 up
 with


flat
 or
 negative
 returns
 and
 for
 the


fourth
 year
 in
 a
 row
 bonds
 actually
 had


worse
 performance
 and
 stocks
 and
 this
 is


despite
 both
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 in
 the


US
 and
 ECB
 in
 Europe
 cutting
 rates


significantly
 last
 year
 and
 most
 of
 the


other
 Global
 central
 banks
 also
 cut


rates
 with
 the
 one
 outlier
 being
 Bank
 of


Japan
 who
 hiked
 rates
 for
 the
 first
 time


since
 2007
 and
 what's
 interesting
 here


and
 just
 to
 take
 the
 us
 as
 an
 example
 is


that
 despite
 the
 FED
 cutting
 rates
 100


basis
 points
 this
 fall
 10year
 yields


were
 actually
 significantly
 higher
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 and
 that's
 not


something
 that
 we
 normally
 see
 in
 the


cutting
 cycle
 so
 the
 central
 bank
 is


lowering
 rates
 the
 longer
 rates
 are


going
 higher
 that's
 very
 unusual
 so
 how


how
 how
 do
 you
 explain
 that


M
 so
 it's
 there
 can
 be
 multiple
 reasons


for
 why
 this
 is
 happening
 so
 to
 name
 a


few
 is
 that
 inflation
 has
 been
 more


sticky
 than
 expected
 and
 growth
 has
 been


pretty
 resilient
 so
 that
 might
 impact


stability
 for
 further
 rate
 Cuts
 another


reason
 could
 be
 higher
 government


spending
 and
 higher
 deficits
 which


increases
 the
 supplier
 Bonds
 in
 the


market
 and
 leading
 to
 investors


requiring
 a
 higher
 compensation
 to
 hold


these
 bonds
 so
 I
 think
 both
 of
 those


themes
 are
 going
 to
 be
 really


interesting
 to
 watch
 into


2025
 okay
 great
 thanks
 looking
 forward


to
 that
 so
 we
 go
 to
 Real
 Estate
 uh
 so
 we


have
 a
 combined
 real
 estate
 portfolio


meaning
 that
 we
 invest
 both
 in
 listed


and
 unlisted
 real
 estate
 uh
 so
 the


unlisted
 part
 had
 a
 negative
 return


almost
 flat
 but
 negative
 of
 1%
 the


listed
 uh
 performed
 pretty
 well
 at
 10%


so
 the
 combined
 portfolio
 these
 are


almost
 50/50
 uh
 is
 awaited
 uh
 5%
 uh
 for


the
 portfolio
 as
 a
 total
 now
 uh
 real


estate
 has
 had
 a
 difficult
 period
 um


this
 chart
 shows
 are
 unlisted
 real


estate
 holdings
 and
 the
 accumulated


Capital
 return
 so
 we're
 not
 counting
 you


know
 the
 running
 return
 because
 that


comes
 in
 addition
 but
 just
 the


capitalization
 of
 our
 investments
 and


you
 can
 see
 that
 it
 peaked
 out
 uh
 in


2022
 and
 has
 fallen
 quite
 sharply
 albe


it
 maybe
 we
 see
 some
 signs
 of
 uh
 a
 kind


of
 a
 stabilization
 of
 those
 returns
 but


to
 get
 more
 light
 on
 that
 we
 turn
 to
 uh


John
 McCarthy
 uh
 head
 of
 our
 us


Investments
 on
 real
 estate
 side
 hi
 John


good
 to
 see
 you
 thank
 you
 Trant
 uh
 good


to
 see
 you
 as
 well
 and
 good
 morning


everyone
 share
 our
 your
 perspective
 on


what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 US
 real
 estate


market
 absolutely
 and
 and
 thank
 you
 for


for
 letting
 me
 update
 you
 and
 and


everyone
 on
 mb's
 real
 estate
 business
 um


Pond
 as
 you
 said
 2024
 marked
 a
 turning


point
 for
 most
 real
 estate
 markets
 after


two
 challenging
 years
 where
 property


values
 went
 down
 especially
 for
 Office


Buildings
 we
 started
 seeing
 some
 good


news
 in
 the
 second
 half
 of
 the
 year
 that


suggest
 things
 are
 beginning
 to


stabilize
 while
 there's
 still
 some


uncertainty
 about
 interest
 rates
 and


inflation
 uh
 we
 became
 more
 optimistic


late
 in
 2024
 and
 we
 got
 a
 clear
 picture


on
 where
 the
 economy
 is
 headed
 looking


at
 the
 US
 specifically
 uh
 people
 working


from
 home
 continued
 to
 affect
 how
 Office


Buildings
 are
 doing
 uh
 but
 we
 saw


progress
 in
 2024
 as
 more
 people


gradually
 return
 to
 offices
 the
 best


Office
 Buildings
 in
 good
 locations
 are


doing
 better
 than
 others
 and
 we
 think


this
 will
 continue
 as
 companies
 figure


out
 their
 long-term
 plans
 for
 how
 they


want
 their
 employees
 to
 work
 logistic


Logistics
 properties
 uh
 meaning


warehouses
 and
 shipping
 facilities


are
 still
 doing
 very
 well
 helped
 by


online
 shopping
 and
 companies
 changing


how
 they
 move
 and
 store
 Goods
 we
 remain


confident
 in
 this
 segment
 of
 the
 real


estate
 market
 our
 investments
 in


publicly
 traded
 real
 estate
 companies


continue
 to
 recover
 in
 2024
 after
 losing


a
 lot
 of
 value
 in
 2022
 uh
 the
 portfolio


benefited
 from
 exposure
 to
 Data
 Centers


and
 senior
 housing
 which
 stayed
 in
 high


demand
 throughout
 the
 year
 while
 some


uncertainties
 remain
 about
 the
 economy


uh
 we're
 carefully
 starting
 to
 invest


more
 in
 real
 estate
 again
 we're
 focused


on
 high
 quality
 quality
 Office
 Buildings


warehouses
 and
 Retail
 properties
 that


are
 now
 selling
 for
 lower
 prices
 we
 have


recently
 invested
 about4
 billion
 into


real
 estate
 that
 aligns
 with
 our


strategy
 for
 example
 uh
 we
 recently


increased
 our
 ownership
 in
 eight
 Office


Buildings
 in
 Boston
 San
 Francisco
 and


Washington
 DC
 giving
 us
 full
 control
 of


these
 properties
 while
 many
 investors


are
 staying
 away
 from
 Office
 Buildings


we
 saw
 this
 as
 a
 good
 opportunity
 to
 buy


high
 quality
 buildings
 at
 attractive


prices
 We
 Believe
 will
 benefit
 from


buying
 properties
 now
 while
 other
 large


investors
 are
 less
 able
 to
 do
 so
 so
 to


sum
 up
 while
 the
 real
 estate
 market


still
 faces
 challenges
 TR
 20124
 gave
 us


reason
 to
 be
 cautiously
 optimistic


that's
 good
 to
 hear
 thanks
 uh
 thanks
 a


lot


Sean
 last
 um
 as
 a
 class
 we
 have
 is


renewable


infrastructure
 uh
 and
 um
 the
 headline


number
 uh
 is
 negative
 10%
 now
 it's
 kind


of
 a
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 a
 complicated
 number


because
 the
 way
 we
 get
 to
 the
 valuation


of
 these
 assets
 is
 to
 look
 at
 uh
 the


long-term
 projections
 for
 power
 prices


and
 also
 discount
 uh
 the
 revenue
 streams


back
 to
 today
 so
 it's
 a
 function
 of


forward
 pricing
 uh
 on
 the
 electricity


side
 and
 interest
 rates
 that
 what


explains
 uh
 the
 negative
 number
 but
 we


have
 um
 haral
 here
 to
 shed
 some
 light
 on


it
 haral
 uh
 what
 are
 you


saying
 yes
 hello
 Nicolai
 yeah
 as
 we
 see


uh
 uh
 from
 the
 Green
 Line
 in
 the
 graph


on
 the
 left
 which
 is
 is
 our
 custom


Renewables
 index
 large
 cap
 renewable


stocks
 have
 had
 a
 difficult
 year
 in
 2024


both
 in
 absolute
 terms
 and
 even
 worse


relative
 to
 the
 General
 stock
 market


shown
 by
 the
 black
 line
 in
 the
 left


graph
 this
 is
 representative
 of
 the


General
 market
 sentiment
 around


renewable
 infrastructure
 globally
 in


2024
 despite
 what
 we
 see
 in
 the
 graph
 on


the
 right
 namely
 that
 Renewables
 had


another
 record
 volume
 growth
 year
 in


2024
 for
 the
 first
 time
 surpassing
 600


gaw
 of
 new
 renewable
 production
 capacity


installed
 the
 negative
 developments
 in


both
 public
 and
 partly
 also
 private


valuations
 are
 mainly
 caused
 by
 a
 rising


interest
 rate
 environment
 as
 you
 said


but
 also
 a
 failure
 by
 the
 industry
 to


deliver
 on
 even
 higher
 growth


expectations
 and
 also
 stronger
 Focus


from
 customers
 on
 security
 of
 Basel
 load


supply
 for
 us
 actually
 this
 is
 good
 news


uh
 as
 we
 have
 deliberately
 kept
 most
 of


our
 powder
 dry
 we've
 deployed
 less
 than


10%
 of
 our
 Renewables
 infrastructure


mandate
 so
 far
 we
 now
 see
 opportunities


to
 enter
 into
 the
 ownership
 of
 more


favorably
 priced
 uh
 renewable
 Assets
 in


the
 coming


years
 very
 good
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 that


wraps
 it
 up
 yeah
 so
 key
 points
 just
 to


reiterate
 133%
 returns
 uh
 on
 the
 fund
 a


strong
 year
 uh
 that
 means
 more
 than


2,500
 billion
 croners
 we
 did
 uh


underperform
 the
 broader
 Market
 by
 20


sorry
 45
 basis
 points
 and
 the
 fund
 value


stood
 at
 almost
 20,000
 billion
 at
 year


end
 um
 also
 uh
 today
 or
 actually
 the
 one


to
 the
 left
 we
 published
 yesterday
 is


our
 Holdings
 list
 uh
 we
 now
 report
 this


twice
 a
 year
 so
 you
 get
 it
 at
 the
 Folia


stage
 uh
 now
 and
 you
 also
 get
 it
 at
 the


half
 year
 stage
 so
 uh
 as
 you
 know
 we


spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 and
 effort
 on
 being


the
 most
 transparent
 Fund
 in
 the
 world


and
 I
 don't
 think
 anybody
 else
 is
 is


even
 close
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 this
 we
 are


also
 today
 publishing
 uh
 an
 update
 on


our
 strategy
 we
 have
 a
 threeyear


strategy
 period
 we
 uh
 had
 an
 update


where
 are
 we
 after
 year
 one
 we
 did
 that


last
 year
 this
 year
 where
 are
 we
 after


year
 two
 uh
 so
 that's
 also
 out
 there
 and


you
 can
 see
 exactly
 what
 we
 have
 been


working
 on
 and
 then
 lastly
 the
 stress


test
 which
 we
 showed
 you
 earlier
 today


that's
 also
 on
 the
 web
 so
 you
 can
 uh


have
 a
 look
 if
 you
 want
 also
 to
 remind


you
 that
 you
 need
 to
 block
 out
 uh
 29th


of
 April
 this
 is
 being
 streamed
 from


lunch
 and
 onwards
 we
 have
 some
 uh


phenomenal


uh
 speakers
 and
 uh
 what
 we
 will
 talk


about
 is
 what
 makes
 a
 great
 company
 so


it
 should
 be
 relevant
 for
 investors
 uh


for
 you
 guys
 for
 everybody
 who
 runs
 a


company
 and
 we
 think
 it
 should
 be
 uh


very
 very
 interesting
 combination
 of


Business
 Leaders
 academics
 uh
 and


investors
 so
 please
 uh
 note
 that
 date
