[Music]


hi
 everyone
 I'm
 thrilled
 to
 be
 here
 with


Yen
 stoltenberg
 who
 just
 finished
 off
 uh


as
 the
 Secretary
 General
 in
 NATO
 and


before
 NATO
 he
 was
 the
 Prime
 Minister
 of


Norway
 warm
 welcome
 y
 thank
 you
 so
 much


for
 having
 me
 so
 I'm
 having
 here
 um
 you


know
 a
 book
 which
 uh
 you
 wrote
 uh
 which


came
 out
 8
 years
 ago
 which
 basically


covered
 the
 period
 until
 10
 years
 ago


and
 it's
 got
 a
 beautiful
 picture
 of
 you


on
 the
 on
 the
 front
 here
 um
 but
 just


what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the
 most
 important


changes
 in
 the
 world
 since
 that
 book


came
 out
 the
 most
 important
 changes
 at


least
 related


to
 my
 task
 my
 responsibilities
 in
 NATO


is
 that
 uh
 the
 world
 has
 become
 more


dangerous
 the
 good
 that's
 the
 bad
 news


the
 good
 news
 is
 that
 NATO
 has
 become


stronger
 to
 protect
 close
 to
 1
 billion


people
 um
 um
 of
 course
 there
 are
 many


other
 changes
 but
 but
 but
 seen
 from
 a


security
 perspective
 we
 have
 now
 a


fullscale
 war
 in
 Europe
 uh
 we
 we
 have
 uh


uh
 a
 new
 very
 devastating
 conflict
 in


the
 Middle
 East
 risk
 of
 escalation
 and


we
 have
 significantly


more
 Global
 rivalry
 between
 great
 Powers


United
 States
 China
 um
 uh
 and
 then
 we


have
 cyber
 hybrid
 terrorist
 threats
 as
 a


constant
 threat
 to
 our
 security
 so
 so


fundamentally
 we
 live
 in
 a
 more


unpredictable
 more
 uh
 uh
 dangerous
 world


than
 we
 have
 done
 for
 decades
 M
 if
 we
 um


cover
 some
 of
 these
 points
 there
 so
 so


how
 do
 you
 think
 the
 Ukraine
 situation


will
 end
 what's
 the
 most
 likely
 Wars
 are


by
 Nature
 extremely
 unpredictable
 and


predictable
 so
 therefore
 I
 will
 be
 very


careful
 predicting
 how
 that
 will
 end
 um


but
 um
 um
 of
 course
 we
 all
 want
 this
 war


to
 end
 the
 challenge
 is
 that
 uh
 the


quickest
 way
 to
 end
 a
 war
 is
 to
 lose
 a


war
 uh
 but
 that
 will
 not
 lead
 to
 peace


that
 will
 lead
 to
 occupation
 of
 Ukraine


and
 Ukraine
 will
 not
 be
 a
 sovereign


independent
 Democratic
 nation
 in
 Europe


and


it
 will
 be
 a
 country
 controlled
 by
 by


Moscow
 so
 if
 you
 want
 the
 war
 to
 end
 in


a
 way
 where
 millions
 of
 ukrainians
 still


can
 live
 in
 a
 free
 Democratic
 Society


then
 we
 need
 to
 convince
 President
 Putin


that
 he
 will
 not
 win
 on
 the
 battlefield


that
 he
 has
 to
 sit
 down
 and
 negotiate


agree
 uh
 a
 solution
 where
 Ukraine
 uh
 can


still
 be
 a
 sovereign
 uh
 Democratic


nation
 and
 I
 don't
 believe
 that
 we
 can


change
 Putin's
 mind
 but
 I
 think
 we
 can


change
 his
 calculus
 meaning
 that
 I
 don't


think
 we
 can
 change
 his
 ambition
 his


goal
 of
 trying
 to
 control
 Ukraine
 but
 I


think
 that
 by
 providing
 Military
 Support


to
 Ukraine
 we
 can
 um
 ensure
 that
 the


cost
 of
 achieving
 that
 goal
 for
 Russia


is
 so
 high
 that
 they
 will
 accept
 a


solution
 where
 Ukraine
 prevails
 in
 one


way
 or
 another
 the
 decision
 of
 um
 not


giving
 uh
 more
 offensive
 weapons
 which


was
 uh
 kind
 of
 renewed
 lately
 what
 do


you
 think
 about
 that
 well
 Al
 NATO
 allies


have
 delivered
 a
 lot
 of
 also
 offensive


weapons
 the
 reality
 is
 that
 of
 course
 we


have
 gradually
 changed
 uh
 uh
 um
 over
 the


years
 I
 remember
 when
 I
 came
 to
 Nato
 in


2014
 then
 some
 allies
 United
 States


United
 Kingdom
 um
 uh
 uh
 a
 couple
 of


other
 Canada
 they
 provided
 some
 Military


Support
 some
 some
 training
 but
 hardly


any
 little
 uh
 weapons
 uh
 it
 was
 a
 big


discussion
 for
 instance
 about
 uh


javelins
 the
 anti-tank
 weapons
 which
 has


Pro
 extremely
 important
 on
 the


battlefield
 in
 Ukraine
 and
 I
 think


actually
 we
 should
 have
 done
 more
 before


the
 fullscale
 invasion
 in


2022
 um
 but
 after
 2022
 the
 full
 scale


Invasion
 NATO
 allies
 have


delivered
 much
 more
 Military
 Support


than
 President
 Putin
 expected
 and
 to
 be


honest
 also
 we
 expected
 um
 we
 had
 big


discussions
 on
 whether
 we
 were
 going
 to


deliver
 battle
 tanks
 now
 allies
 deliver


a
 lot
 of
 advanced
 modern
 battle
 tanks


including
 us
 Abrams
 Tanks
 European
 or


German


leopard
 tanks
 um
 we
 deliver
 Advanced
 Air


Defense
 systems
 Patriots
 we
 deliver
 uh


long
 range
 artillery
 also
 cruise


missiles
 uh
 from
 for
 instance
 United


Kingdom
 and
 France
 and
 then
 also
 f-16s


so
 the
 the
 scale
 and
 the
 quality
 of
 this


Military
 Support
 is
 much
 bigger
 than


anyone
 was
 able
 to
 foresee
 uh
 just
 a


couple
 of
 years
 ago
 uh
 I
 think
 the
 The


Dilemma
 which
 has
 which
 continues
 to
 be


discussed
 among
 allies
 is
 to
 what
 extent


will
 should
 we
 allow
 Ukraine
 to
 use
 all


these
 weapons
 against
 military
 targets


inside
 Russia
 and
 allies
 have
 different


policy
 some
 NATO
 allies
 have
 said
 uh


there
 are
 no
 restrictions
 um
 except
 for


uh
 also
 adhering
 to
 international
 law
 uh


others
 have
 imposed
 some
 restrictions
 on


the
 use
 of
 uh
 weapons
 deep
 into
 Russia


what
 do
 you
 think
 I
 think
 we
 need
 to


remember
 what
 this
 is
 that
 this
 is
 a
 war


aggression
 Russia
 has
 attacked
 another


country
 that's
 a
 blatant
 violation
 of


international
 law
 um
 according
 to


international
 law
 Ukraine
 has
 the
 right


for


self-defense
 uh
 self-defense
 includes


the
 right
 to
 strike
 legitimate
 military


Targets
 on
 the
 territory
 of
 the


aggressor
 meaning
 Russia
 so
 therefore
 I


have
 argued
 for
 uh
 loosening
 up
 these


restrictions
 uh
 and
 uh
 many
 allies
 have


done
 so
 and
 then
 there
 is
 a
 ongoing


conversation
 among
 NATO
 allies
 exactly


to
 what
 extent
 they
 should
 remove
 all


the
 restrictions
 uh
 uh
 um
 when
 it
 comes


to
 hitting
 legitimate
 military
 targets


under
 territor
 if
 uh
 Ukraine
 have
 to


recede
 more
 territory
 is
 that
 more


likely
 to
 happen
 you
 think
 I'm
 extremely


careful
 even
 though
 I'm
 now
 stepped
 down


as
 secret
 General
 to
 to
 to
 a
 way
 to
 to


speculate
 because
 it
 can
 be


self-fulfilling
 prophecies
 if
 you
 start


to
 say
 that
 we
 believe
 that
 Ukraine
 has


to
 do
 this
 and
 that
 or
 seed
 more


territory
 then
 of
 course
 it
 can
 boost
 R


the
 morale
 of
 the
 Russians
 and
 reduce


the
 moral
 morale
 of
 the
 ukrainians
 and


even
 though
 I
 know
 that
 I'm
 not
 speaking


on
 behalf
 of
 NATO
 anymore
 I
 think
 it


matters
 what
 we
 all
 say
 uh
 when
 it
 comes


to
 what
 we
 believe
 that


Ukraine
 uh
 also
 may
 be
 forced
 to
 um


fundamentally
 it
 is
 only
 the
 ukrainians


that
 can
 decide
 uh
 what
 are
 acceptable


conditions
 they
 are
 paying
 the
 highest


price
 they
 are
 sacrificing
 people
 uh
 uh


every
 day
 to
 to
 fight
 for
 their
 freedom


and
 again
 I
 think
 that
 the
 path
 to
 peace


is
 to
 convince
 Putin
 that
 he
 cannot
 win


on
 the
 battlefield
 uh
 there
 is
 a
 very


close
 relationship
 between
 what
 happens


on
 the
 battlefield
 and
 what
 can
 happen


around
 the
 negotiating
 table
 so
 if
 you


want
 some
 kind
 of
 acceptable
 solution


where
 Ukraine
 will
 remain
 as
 a


independent
 nation
 then
 military


strength
 on
 the
 battlefield
 is
 the
 way


to
 convince
 Putin
 that
 that
 he
 has
 to


accept
 that
 then
 of
 course
 it's
 for
 the


ukrainians
 to
 decide
 uh


how
 much
 they
 are
 willing
 to
 to
 give
 up


to
 to
 to
 achieve
 peace
 I
 I've
 met
 many


Finnish
 politicians
 of
 the
 last
 couple


of
 years
 since
 fin
 now
 had
 joined
 NATO
 I


think
 we
 even
 have
 the
 president
 in
 Oso


today
 yeah
 yeah
 you're
 absolutely
 right


and
 um
 and
 I
 and
 Alex
 St
 the
 president


of
 uh
 of
 Finland
 uh
 um
 they
 always
 or


they
 often
 and
 and
 many
 other
 finish


politicians
 have
 have
 in
 a
 way
 shared


with
 us
 the
 the
 history
 of
 Finland
 um


it's
 different
 from
 Ukraine
 but
 there


are
 there
 are
 some
 parallels
 they
 were


invaded
 by
 the
 Red
 Army
 in


1939
 um
 and
 they
 were
 able
 to
 as
 a
 small


country
 to
 to
 to
 inflict
 much
 more
 heavy


losses
 uh
 and
 pain
 on
 the
 invading


Russian
 or
 Soviet
 forces
 so
 the
 Red
 Army


didn't
 achieve
 their
 goals
 but
 to
 end


the
 war
 Finland
 had
 to
 accept
 to
 give
 up


to
 seed
 roughly
 10%
 of
 their
 territory


and
 their
 second
 biggest
 city
 vorg
 which


is
 now
 part
 of
 Russia
 MH


uh
 but
 of
 course
 uh
 in
 return
 they


gained
 borders
 and
 security
 that
 has


lasted
 for


decades
 um
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that
 this
 is


the
 parallel
 for
 ukra
 and
 a
 NATO


membership
 a
 NATO
 membership
 what's
 been


the
 most
 important
 advice
 you've
 given


your
 successor
 Mark
 R
 first
 of
 all
 I


I've
 been
 very
 careful
 giving
 any
 advice


because
 I
 I
 I
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 that


you
 know
 people
 are
 leaving
 a
 position


should
 be
 to
 especially
 not
 in
 public
 to


explicit
 on
 advice
 and
 so
 on
 I
 have


great
 trust
 in
 Mar
 he's
 a
 great
 leader


he
 has
 been
 prime
 minister
 for
 I
 think


it's
 14
 years
 uh
 and
 of
 course
 just
 to


lead
 coalitions
 to
 find
 compromises
 I


think
 is
 the
 best
 way
 to
 qualify
 to


become
 a
 Secret
 General
 NATO
 to
 to
 to


know
 how
 to
 to
 to
 reconcile
 different


views
 um


but
 but
 I
 I
 cannot
 hide
 that
 of
 course


the
 most
 important
 task
 for
 any
 Secor


General
 NATO
 is
 to
 keep
 this
 big
 uh
 uh


family
 uh
 together
 yeah
 and
 we
 are
 32


allies
 uh
 and
 we
 don't
 always
 agree
 on


all
 issues
 so
 his
 main
 task
 is
 to
 ensure


that
 despite
 these
 differences
 that
 we


are
 able
 to
 u
 to
 to
 Rally
 around
 the


core
 task
 to
 protect
 and
 defend
 each


other
 you
 have
 um
 over
 the
 last
 few


years
 become
 more
 vocal
 about
 China
 um


what
 are
 the
 concerns
 you
 have
 first
 I


would
 like
 to
 say
 that
 if
 you
 instance


read
 that
 book
 uh
 so
 M
 I
 read
 it
 twice


yeah
 yeah
 love
 it
 I
 I
 I
 I
 know
 I
 was
 a


great
 believer
 in
 China
 for
 many
 years


um
 and
 I
 was
 EXT
 extremely
 impressed
 I
 I


remember
 I
 visited
 China
 Al
 in
 85
 or
 '


86
 Le
 middle
 of
 the
 '
 80s
 and
 I
 was


extremely
 impressed
 um
 by
 the
 changes


that
 Ding
 did
 and
 how
 they
 were
 opening


up
 their
 economy
 uh
 how
 the
 economic


growth
 of
 China
 changed
 the
 world
 partly


for
 the
 people
 in
 China
 uh
 lifted


hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 people
 out
 of


poverty
 but
 also
 actually
 important
 for


the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 uh
 by
 creating
 a


big
 New
 Market
 by
 by
 by
 providing
 lot
 of


products
 uh
 to
 the
 global
 economy
 Norway


benefited
 we
 sold
 a
 lot
 of
 energy
 oil


gas
 uh
 into
 the
 Chinese
 market
 or
 Global


Market
 uh
 and
 then
 we
 bought
 a
 lot
 of
 uh


things
 from
 China
 good
 price
 uh
 so
 that


has
 been
 a
 great
 success
 story
 for
 China


and
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 um
 uh
 then


I
 can
 not
 say
 exactly
 when
 My
 Views


started
 to
 change
 but
 I
 remember
 I
 was


very
 disappointed
 the
 way
 China
 re


reacted
 when
 the
 Norwegian
 Nobel
 Peace


Prize
 committee
 awarded
 the
 Peace
 Prize


to
 a
 Chinese
 disident
 I
 think
 it
 was
 in


2010
 and
 then
 they
 actually
 imposed


heavy
 sanctions
 against
 Norway
 and


behaved
 very
 they
 wanted
 us
 to
 apologize


uh
 and
 and
 that
 behavior
 was
 quite


shocking
 and
 then
 of
 course
 after
 I


arrived
 in
 NATO
 and
 over
 the
 last
 years


we
 have
 seen
 a
 much
 more
 assertive
 China


trying
 to
 dominate
 control
 the
 South


China
 Sea
 uh
 they
 have
 lost
 actually
 in


the
 international
 Court
 in
 the
 hog
 so


what
 they
 do
 there
 is
 a
 violation
 of


international
 law
 threatening
 neighbors


um
 threatening
 Taiwan
 uh
 and
 China
 is


investing
 heavily
 in
 new
 Advanced


weapons
 including
 nuclear
 weapons
 um


without
 any
 transparency
 and
 then
 of


course
 in
 Ukraine
 what
 we
 see
 there
 is


that
 security
 is
 not
 uh
 Regional


security
 is
 global
 because
 China
 is
 the


main
 enabler
 of
 Russia's
 aggressive
 war


against
 Ukraine
 uh
 by
 providing
 the
 uh


micro
 Electronics
 the
 components
 for


Russians
 to
 build
 the
 bombs
 and
 the


missiles
 they're
 using
 uh
 in
 Ukraine
 so


the
 Clos
 and
 closer
 alignment
 between


Russia
 and
 China
 Al
 of
 course
 is
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 why
 we
 are
 concerned
 let
 me


add
 one
 more
 thing
 and
 that
 is
 that
 CH


we
 don't
 Al
 when
 I
 was
 Secretary
 General


NATO
 I
 remember
 very
 well
 that
 we
 didn't


we
 didn't
 say
 that
 China
 is
 an
 enemy
 or


an
 adversary
 we
 need
 to
 engage
 with


China
 on
 issues
 related
 to
 climate


change
 they
 have
 to
 be
 part
 of
 the


global
 economy
 of
 course
 uh
 and
 and
 um


in
 the
 future
 hopefully
 also
 arms


control
 but
 we
 but
 we
 have
 to
 be
 not


it's
 important
 that
 we're
 not
 naive
 and


not
 make
 the
 same
 mistakes
 as
 we
 did
 for


instance
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 Russia
 being


over
 dependent
 on
 gas
 from
 Russia
 we


should
 not
 be
 over
 dependent
 on
 specific


Commodities
 or
 technology
 from
 China
 the


fact
 that
 there
 are
 stronger
 and


stronger
 links
 between
 the
 autocrats
 in


the
 world
 what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the


implications
 for
 the
 Western
 world
 that


we
 have
 to
 be
 uh
 together
 when
 we
 see


that
 the
 autocrats
 are
 more
 and
 more


aligned
 and
 then
 of
 course
 that's
 partly


we
 meaning
 partly
 NATO
 allies
 so
 32


Nations
 on
 the
 both
 sou
 Atlantic
 but


also
 with
 other
 countries
 which
 at
 least


don't
 to
 be
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 part
 of


kind
 of
 autocratic
 Alliance
 and
 again


Ukraine
 is
 perhaps
 the
 the
 clear
 example


Russia
 is
 responsible
 for
 war
 aggression


the
 main
 providers
 of
 weapons
 uh
 and
 and


enablers
 of
 that
 war
 is
 North
 Korea
 uh


Iran
 and
 China
 uh
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 this
 is


not
 rhetoric
 this
 is
 this
 is
 this
 is


real
 and
 makes
 a
 difference
 on
 the


battlefield
 and
 we
 also
 also
 see
 how


Russia
 and
 China
 are
 exercise
 you
 more


together
 um
 also
 around
 Japan
 uh
 um
 uh


and
 know
 parts
 of
 the
 world
 so
 so
 this


is
 really
 a
 global
 picture
 that
 makes
 it


even
 more
 important
 that
 of
 course
 NATO


allies
 stand
 together
 but
 also
 that
 we


work
 with
 Partners
 all
 around
 the
 world


including
 South
 Korea
 Japan
 and
 many


other
 countries
 how
 do
 you
 read
 them
 the


activities
 around
 Taiwan
 just
 now
 well
 I


we
 see
 that
 China
 again
 and
 again
 repeat


uh
 different
 threats
 uh
 both
 in
 rhetoric


but
 also
 with
 these
 very
 high-profile
 uh


uh
 exercises
 we
 actually
 exercising
 how


to
 invade
 Taiwan
 and
 that
 will
 be
 uh


extremely
 dangerous
 and
 uh
 and
 the


rhetoric
 is
 is
 dangerous
 therefore
 it
 is


important
 that
 we
 that
 military
 force
 is


not
 used
 to
 change
 status
 quo
 uh
 in
 and


around
 Taiwan
 uh
 there
 are
 millions
 of


people
 living
 there
 um
 uh
 NATO
 allies


recognize
 that
 uh
 and
 and
 Norway
 uh


recognize
 that
 there's
 one
 China
 uh
 but


but
 we
 also
 uh
 support
 the
 idea
 of


people
 having
 the
 right
 to
 live
 in
 a


democratic
 and
 opposite
 Society
 we
 had


the
 same
 idea
 with
 Hong
 Kong
 that
 was


two
 systems
 in
 one
 nation
 that
 Hong
 Kong


should
 be
 some
 kind
 of
 democratic
 part


of
 China
 uh
 that
 didn't
 last
 for
 very


long
 and
 of
 course
 it
 will
 be
 a
 trategy


of
 millions
 of
 people
 living
 in
 Taiwan


experien
 something
 similar
 to
 what
 the


people
 of
 Hong
 Kong
 has
 experienced
 over


the
 last
 years
 how
 should
 the
 Business


Leaders
 and
 we
 as
 investors
 think
 about


engaging
 with
 China
 this
 is
 extremely


difficult
 question
 uh
 but
 I
 think
 just


to
 be
 aware
 Ware
 that
 there
 are
 dilemas


and
 to
 be
 conscious
 uh
 about
 those


dilemas
 helps
 uh
 uh
 I
 I
 have
 been
 and
 I


continue
 to
 be
 a
 strong
 believer
 in
 free


trade
 and
 most
 of
 my
 political
 life
 I


really
 worked
 for
 free
 trade
 agreements


including
 uh
 the
 open
 European
 market


and
 I
 believe
 that
 globalization
 free


trade
 benefits
 us


all
 having
 said
 that
 freedom
 is
 more


important
 than
 free
 trade
 and
 sometimes


you
 have
 to
 recognize
 that
 you
 cannot


have
 free
 trade
 if
 it
 uh
 if
 the
 cost
 is


that
 you
 actually
 undermine
 freedom
 and


one
 example
 is
 Russian
 gas
 uh
 until
 2022


many
 European
 governments
 meant
 that


buying
 gas
 from
 Russia
 was
 a
 commercial


issue
 it
 it
 it
 was
 not
 a
 political


issues
 polit
 politicians
 should
 stay
 out


of
 a
 commercial
 deal
 between
 commercial


companies
 in
 Europe
 with
 commercial


companies
 in
 in
 Russia
 that
 proved
 very


wrong
 because
 to
 buy
 gas
 from
 Russia
 is


not
 a
 commercial
 issue
 at
 least
 much


more
 than
 a
 commercial
 issue
 it
 it
 was


it
 was
 a
 security
 vulnerability
 that


that
 Russia
 utilized
 after
 uh
 the
 full


scale
 Evas
 of
 Ukraine
 they
 tried
 to


cerse
 European
 allies
 from
 supporting


Ukraine
 by
 using
 the
 gas
 and
 we
 should


not
 repeat
 the
 same
 mistakes
 with
 uh


with
 uh
 with
 China
 it's
 quite
 amazing


that
 we
 ended
 up
 in
 that
 situation


actually
 with
 uh
 Russian
 gas
 yeah
 yeah


it
 wasn't
 amazing
 but
 I
 think
 we
 need
 to


remember


that
 it
 was
 quite
 common
 European
 view


that
 that
 we
 that
 that
 trade
 with
 that


all
 kind
 of
 trade
 with
 Russia
 was
 a
 good


thing
 and
 again
 I
 have
 been
 partly
 part


of
 that
 that
 view
 I
 have
 been
 in
 favor


of
 trade
 with
 Russia
 I've
 been
 in
 favor


of
 trade
 with
 China
 with
 very
 little


restrictions
 then
 gradually
 I
 I
 I
 saw


how
 especially
 Russia
 but
 also
 to
 some


extent
 China
 has
 used
 trade
 as
 a


political
 tool
 and
 therefore
 the


politicians
 have
 responsibilities
 to
 put


in
 some
 regulations
 laws
 uh
 to
 ensure


that
 we
 don't
 make
 the
 really
 big


mistakes
 but
 within
 those
 regulations


there
 has
 to
 also
 be
 judgment
 by
 each


and
 individual
 private
 commercial


company
 and
 and
 the
 Dilemma
 is
 that
 the


the
 extremes
 will
 not
 work
 we
 cannot


have
 absolutely
 open
 and
 free
 trade


there
 has
 to
 be
 some
 security
 uh
 uh


considerations
 uh
 part
 of
 those


decisions


uh
 but
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 we
 cannot


isolate
 China
 so
 to
 find
 this
 balance


where
 we
 have
 some
 trade
 some
 uh


economic
 relations
 but
 without
 making


ourself
 too
 vulnerable
 I
 I
 cannot
 give


the
 exact
 answer
 but
 the
 dialogue


between
 governments
 uh
 companies
 on
 how


to
 find
 this
 balance
 is
 the
 B
 way
 best


way
 to
 try
 to
 at
 least
 find
 the
 best
 way


forward
 together
 last
 Hotpot
 uh
 Middle


East
 how
 do
 you
 think
 that
 will
 play
 out


it's
 difficult
 to
 predict
 Ukraine
 even


harder
 to
 predict
 the
 Middle
 East
 uh
 and


um
 what
 we
 see
 now
 is
 a
 trategy
 um
 um


it's
 dangerous
 um
 and
 there
 is
 risk
 of


further
 escalation
 uh
 and
 especially


with
 Iran
 uh
 which
 has
 de
 stabilized
 the


region
 for
 many
 years
 and
 continue
 to
 do


so
 um
 as
 a
 norian
 I
 think
 it's
 important


to
 remember
 that
 in


1993
 we
 had
 the
 Osa
 Accord
 which
 has


been
 heavily
 criticized
 since
 for
 many


years
 but
 I
 still
 believe
 that
 that's
 in


a
 way
 the
 only
 way
 that
 can
 create
 some


kind
 of
 lasting
 solution
 and
 that's
 a


two-state
 solution
 you
 need
 a
 state
 for


the
 Israelis
 and
 you
 need
 a
 Palestinian


or
 state
 for
 the
 pal


Palestinians
 it's
 not
 easy
 but
 the


alternative
 to
 continue
 as
 we
 do
 now
 is


absolutely
 not
 viable
 uh
 so
 therefore


sometimes
 crisis
 creates
 the
 momentum
 to


find
 new
 Solutions
 uh
 and
 hopefully
 at


least
 one
 thing
 that
 can
 come
 out
 of


what
 we
 see
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 now
 is
 a


renewed
 effort
 to
 uh
 find
 a
 two-state


solution
 there
 are
 some
 voices
 that
 want


the
 EU
 to
 play
 a
 more
 important
 part
 in


defense
 policy
 what
 is
 your
 view
 on
 that


my
 view
 is
 that
 if
 it's
 done
 in
 the


right
 way
 is
 very
 good
 if
 it's
 done
 in


the
 wrong
 way
 it's
 very
 bad
 uh
 so
 what's


the
 right
 way
 and
 the
 right
 way
 is
 that


EU
 should
 do
 more
 and
 they
 and
 and
 they


have
 started
 to
 step
 up
 uh
 when
 it
 comes


to
 for
 instance
 strengthening
 the


defense
 industry
 meaning
 uh
 overcoming


the
 fragmentation
 of
 the
 European


Defense
 industry
 um
 to
 increase
 defense


spending
 uh
 and
 to
 and
 to
 in
 general


strengthen
 European
 uh
 uh
 uh
 defenses


meaning
 that
 that
 that
 will
 also


strengthen
 NATO
 um
 uh
 96%
 of
 the
 people


living
 in
 the
 European
 Union
 they
 live


in
 a
 NATO
 country
 so
 that
 will
 be
 more


or
 less
 the
 same
 what
 is
 not
 good
 is
 to


create
 alternative
 and
 competing


structures
 uh
 and
 to
 and
 to
 underpin
 the


idea
 of
 Eur
 the
 European
 Union
 uh


defending
 Europe
 but
 can
 you
 see
 that


some
 people
 are
 in
 favor
 of
 this
 given


the
 US
 position
 yes
 but
 I
 think
 that's


that's
 dangerous
 I
 I
 I
 I
 think
 that
 any


uh
 attempt
 to
 in
 a
 way
 uh
 split
 or


divide
 Europe
 from
 North
 America
 will


undermine
 our
 security
 because
 we
 live


in
 a
 more
 dangerous
 world
 and
 and
 if
 we


go
 alone
 we
 will
 be
 weaker
 and
 more


vulnerable
 um
 and
 the
 European
 Union


cannot
 defend
 uh
 Europe
 um
 80%
 of
 NATO's


defense
 expenditure
 comes
 from
 non-eu


NATO
 allies
 that's
 of
 course
 United


States
 but
 also
 Canada
 a
 big
 Ally
 uh
 uh


the
 United
 Kingdom
 the
 second
 biggest


defense
 spender
 in
 uh
 in
 in
 NATO
 uh
 but


also
 uh
 this
 is
 about
 geography
 turkey


in
 in
 the
 South
 extremely
 important
 for


fighting
 Isis
 fighting
 terrorism


bordering
 Iraq
 and
 uh
 and
 Syria
 in
 the


north
 Norway
 in
 Iceland
 perhaps
 not
 the


biggest
 NATO
 allies
 but
 very
 important


for
 the
 transatlantic
 link
 for
 so
 so
 so


geography
 and
 resources
 makes
 it
 clear


that
 this
 idea
 that
 EU
 should
 develop


some
 kind
 of
 independent
 defense
 will


just
 undermine
 uh
 and
 duplicate
 uh
 the


NATO
 structures
 and
 the
 NATO
 structures


has
 to
 North
 America
 and
 Europe
 together


uh
 is
 the
 only
 way
 to
 defend
 uh
 Europe


we
 are
 together
 we
 are
 50%
 of
 the


world's
 military
 might
 and
 50%
 of
 the


world's
 uh
 economic
 Mar
 so
 as
 long
 as
 we


stand
 together
 North
 americ
 Europe
 will


be
 safe
 good
 space


yeah
 cor
 lot
 of
 issues
 yeah
 well
 there


are
 so
 the
 world
 is
 so
 complex
 right
 it


is
 it
 is
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 space
 from
 a


Warfare
 point
 of
 view
 so
 first
 I
 think


what
 we
 see
 is
 that
 is
 more
 and
 more


weaponization
 of
 space
 and
 and
 what


happens
 in
 space
 space
 matters
 more
 and


more
 for
 uh
 what's
 going
 on
 on
 the
 earth


that's
 obvious
 for
 communications
 GPS


cyber
 and
 then
 of
 course
 targeting
 a
 lot


of
 military
 operations
 in
 Ukraine
 are


dependent
 on
 satellites
 in
 in
 in
 space


and
 and
 any
 future
 conflict
 space
 uh


will
 be
 important
 uh
 what
 we
 also
 then


see
 is
 that
 again
 Russia
 and
 China
 are


developing
 capabilities
 that
 can


actually
 be
 used
 as
 offensive
 weapons
 uh


and
 this
 is
 a
 dangerous
 uh
 uh
 um


development
 and
 again
 the
 there's
 a
 need


for
 transparency
 there
 is
 a
 need
 for
 uh


Arms
 Control
 uh
 and
 there
 is
 a
 need
 also


for
 for
 allies
 and
 partners
 to
 stand


together
 to
 address
 these
 issues


together
 in
 a
 way
 a
 bit
 related
 to
 that


AI
 what
 are
 the
 issues
 surrounding
 that


when
 it
 comes
 to
 Warfare
 some
 people
 uh


in
 America
 say
 that
 we
 should
 build
 AI


into
 everything
 we
 do
 into
 all
 the


weapons
 all
 the
 cars
 everything
 right
 to


beat
 the
 Chinese
 in
 this
 kind
 of
 fight


what
 how
 do
 you
 see
 AI
 impact
 Warfare


also
 I
 I
 have
 to
 admit
 that
 I
 have
 read


and
 and
 listened
 to
 many
 experts
 uh


explaining
 about
 Ai
 and
 and
 and
 I
 still


struggle
 to
 fully
 understand
 the
 full


implications
 but
 I
 think
 what
 is
 obvious


that
 AI
 has
 and
 will
 even
 more
 so
 in
 the


future
 change
 nature
 of
 warfare
 uh


perhaps
 as
 fundamental
 as
 the
 Industrial


Revolution
 did
 because
 you
 have
 to


understand
 that
 if
 you
 go
 to
 if
 you
 go


to
 the
 from
 from
 from
 from
 cesa
 to


Napoleon
 the
 soldiers
 could
 actually


participate


the
 the
 the
 the
 soldiers
 participating


uh
 in
 the
 Roman
 Empire
 or
 part
 of
 the


Roman
 Empire
 they
 could
 actually
 make
 a


difference
 on
 the
 battlefield
 uh
 during


the
 napic
 War
 uh
 because
 they
 had
 they


had
 the
 technology
 that
 actually
 was


applicable
 also
 at
 that
 time
 then
 from


napic
 war
 to
 the
 first
 world
 everything


first
 world
 war
 everything
 changed
 with


the
 Industrial
 Revolution
 being
 Al
 then


implemented
 into
 Warfare
 I
 think
 we
 see


something
 similar
 now
 uh
 a
 fundamental


shift
 where
 we
 don't
 ful


understand
 but
 but
 but
 autonomous


systems
 uh
 facial
 recognition
 um


drones
 cyber
 attacks
 by
 using
 also
 AI
 is


has
 the
 potential
 of
 changing
 Warfare
 so


much
 that
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 fully
 uh


understand
 uh
 the
 full
 implications
 we


have
 SE
 we
 have
 already
 seen
 it
 on
 the


battlefield
 in
 uh
 Ukraine
 yeah
 um
 it's


not
 the
 secret
 that
 some
 of
 the
 drones


and
 the
 surveillance
 systems
 that
 NATO


operates
 also
 uses
 AI
 uh
 to
 process


information
 so
 this
 is
 a
 this
 has


already
 started
 but
 we
 only
 seen
 the


beginning
 of
 a
 fundamental
 change
 of
 the


natural
 Warfare
 interestingly
 the
 two
 uh


Nobel
 prizes
 that
 were
 won
 over
 the
 last


week
 in
 chemistry
 and
 physics
 uh
 you


know
 have
 ai
 underpinnings
 so
 it
 is


really
 changing
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 um


but
 the
 fact
 that
 uh
 we
 regul
 AI
 so
 much


in
 Europe
 is
 that
 holding
 back
 our


defense


capabilities
 so
 far
 I've
 not
 heard
 the


defense
 industry
 complaining
 about
 that


but
 but
 it
 maybe
 uh
 and
 um
 and
 and
 I


think
 the
 challenge
 the
 dilemas
 every


time
 we
 we
 we
 approach
 new
 technologies


is
 that
 in
 one
 way
 we
 want
 ethical


standards
 we
 want
 transparency
 we
 want


regulations
 to
 prevent
 the
 misuse
 of


important
 technology
 on
 the
 other
 hand


if
 we
 only
 impose
 restrictions
 on


ourselves
 being
 Europe
 or
 or
 or
 North


American
 Europe
 Western
 Alliance
 but
 but


but
 our
 adversaries
 they
 have
 no


restrictions
 then
 of
 course
 we
 can
 just


make
 ourself
 more
 vulnerable


fundamentally
 this
 is
 very
 much
 the
 same


dilemas
 we
 have
 faced
 with
 nuclear
 uh


weapons
 of
 course
 nuclear
 weapons
 are


extremely
 devastating
 the
 potential
 to


really
 destroy
 uh
 human
 life
 in
 the
 way


we
 know
 it
 today
 uh
 so
 in
 that
 way
 it's


very
 easy
 to
 be
 against
 nuclear
 weapons


and
 and
 and
 I
 would
 like
 to
 have
 a
 world


without
 any
 nuclear
 weapons
 the


challenge
 is
 that
 as
 long
 as
 they
 exist


I
 think
 we
 are
 safer
 when
 we
 have


nuclear
 weapons
 to
 deter
 the
 adversary


of
 using
 those
 weapons
 against
 us
 so


unilateral
 disarmament
 is
 dangerous
 uh


what
 it
 is
 good
 and
 what
 you
 should


strive
 for
 is
 balanced


transparent
 uh
 uh
 uh
 multilateral
 uh


arms
 control
 that
 applies
 for
 nuclear


weapons
 but
 fundamentally
 it
 also


applies
 for
 all
 other
 Technologies
 for


instance
 AI
 cyber
 well
 in
 one
 way
 we


have
 all
 touched
 upon
 it
 because
 cyber


and
 AI
 is
 interl
 um
 and
 um
 and
 it
 just


demonstrates
 that
 Warfare
 conflicts
 can


take
 place
 in
 many
 domains
 in
 the
 old


times
 we
 had
 in
 way
 air
 sea
 and
 land
 uh


but
 now
 we
 have
 space
 as
 a
 domain
 and


cyber
 as
 domain
 but
 do
 we
 have
 strong


enough
 uh
 offensive
 capabilities
 in


cyber
 or
 are
 we
 just
 continuous
 attack


and
 defend
 no
 again
 these
 are
 sensitive


issues
 and
 I
 know
 that
 some
 some


countries
 are
 very
 reluctant
 to
 speak


too
 much
 about
 it
 but
 I
 know
 and
 it's


not
 the
 secret
 that
 NATO
 allies
 also


have
 uh
 offensive
 capabilities
 I
 think


we
 call
 them
 National
 effects
 but
 it's


only
 different
 word
 for
 the
 same
 and
 I


had
 the
 the
 very
 interesting
 experience


when
 I
 actually
 saw
 uh
 in
 one
 of
 the


allot
 countries
 uh
 how
 they
 used
 I
 was


actually
 in
 the
 kind
 of
 Command
 Center


cyber
 Command
 Center


where
 they
 actually
 used
 cyber
 offensive


capabilities
 to
 attack
 Isis
 this
 was


back
 in
 201
 16
 or
 17
 uh
 and
 that
 was


extremely
 effective
 uh
 how
 NATO
 Ally


used
 cyber
 to
 take
 down
 the
 Cyber


networks
 um
 uh
 of
 ice
 in
 Iraq
 in
 Iraq


and
 and
 Syria
 then
 of


course
 that's
 perhaps
 the
 most
 not
 the


most
 advanced
 adversary
 that
 you
 can


face
 but
 of
 course
 there
 are
 offensive


capabilities
 because
 cyber
 is
 now
 a


domain
 as
 air
 sea
 land
 and
 the
 other


domains
 are
 and
 a
 truly
 Global
 domain


there
 are
 some
 problems
 one
 problem
 is


that
 attribution
 is
 harder
 in
 cyber
 uh


so
 one
 of
 the
 first
 challenge
 you
 will


face
 with
 a
 with
 a
 full-fledged
 Cyber


attack
 is
 to
 actually
 decide
 who
 is


attacking
 you
 um
 uh
 uh


second
 um
 the
 other
 challenge
 is
 that
 is


that
 um


um
 it's
 it's
 it's
 there's
 a
 much
 more


more
 much
 blur
 more
 blurred
 line
 between


conflict
 and
 non-conflict
 when
 when
 when


do
 you
 have
 to
 trigger
 Article
 Five
 when


do
 you
 have
 to
 declare
 war
 uh
 uh
 when


you
 have
 a
 Cyber
 attack
 because
 Cyber


attack
 is
 something
 that's
 go
 goes
 on


almost
 every
 day
 in
 different
 ways
 yeah


and
 when
 when
 do
 you
 surpass
 the


threshold
 of
 something
 which
 which
 will


trigger
 a
 full
 response
 from
 yeah
 from


the
 armed
 forces
 from
 uh
 from
 perhaps
 or


or
 NATO
 alliance
 so
 the
 French
 um


Statesman
 clemont
 s
 said
 war
 is
 too


important
 to
 be
 left
 of
 generals
 and
 you


have
 paraphrased
 this
 by
 saying
 business


is
 too
 serious
 to
 be
 left
 to
 Business


Leaders
 alone
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you


mean
 by
 that
 I
 mean
 by
 that
 that
 um
 I


believe
 in
 free
 trade
 I
 believe
 in


private
 business
 but
 I
 believe
 that
 um


some
 of
 the
 issues
 related
 to
 commercial


decisions
 are
 too
 important
 to
 be
 left


to
 commercial
 decisions
 or


considerations
 alone
 and
 again
 we
 have


touched
 upon
 the
 the
 most
 recent


examples
 G
 from
 from
 Russia
 or
 over


dependence
 on
 uh
 Commodities
 from
 China


or
 the
 export
 of
 key
 Technologies
 from


us
 to
 authoritarian
 Powers
 it
 may
 be
 a


good
 business
 deal
 but
 it
 will
 be
 uh


undermining
 or
 dangerous
 for
 our
 own
 uh


own
 security
 or
 for
 instance
 allow


authoritarian
 Powers
 uh
 to
 control


critical
 infrastructure
 again
 maybe
 good


business
 deals
 but
 make
 us
 but
 make
 but


may
 potenti
 make
 us
 vulnerable
 so
 this


is
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 it's
 too
 important
 to


be
 left
 to
 businessmen
 alone
 a
 US


Venture
 Capital
 firms
 have
 ramped
 up
 um


efforts
 within
 defense
 but
 we
 haven't


really
 done
 the
 same
 in
 Europe
 even


though
 NATO
 has
 uh
 Venture
 Capital
 arm


right
 yes
 how
 how
 do
 you
 see
 this


developing
 well
 I
 I
 think
 that
 we
 need


um
 we
 need
 to
 invest
 more
 in
 our
 defense


industry
 uh
 and
 uh
 and
 we
 also
 need
 to


realize
 that
 we
 need
 Venture
 Capital
 we


need
 um
 Innovation
 and
 that's
 the
 reason


why
 NATO
 again
 Al
 I'm
 now
 stepped
 down


but
 I'm
 sure
 that
 Mark
 the
 the
 current


Secretary
 General
 will
 follow
 up
 on
 this


uh
 has
 stepped
 up
 um
 uh
 the
 efforts
 to


work
 with
 private
 business
 uh
 to
 ensure


that
 we
 maintain
 the
 technological
 Edge


which
 has
 been
 the
 benefit
 of
 Western


countries
 for
 decades
 and
 help
 to
 ensure


our
 security
 we
 always
 had
 the
 most


Advanced
 Technologies
 that
 is
 not
 so


obvious
 anymore
 especially
 in
 of
 the


Chinese
 economy
 and
 and
 their
 ability
 to


also
 develop
 new
 technologies
 and
 uh
 and


use
 those
 Technologies
 in
 their
 defense


uh
 production
 um
 there's
 also
 an
 other


change
 that
 has
 happened
 over
 decades


back
 in
 the
 40s
 and
 50s
 and
 60s
 perhaps


even
 the
 70s
 most
 of
 the
 defense


technology
 was
 developed
 by
 the


government
 uh
 nuclear
 was
 a
 big
 state


run
 program
 Manhattan
 program
 in
 the
 US


uh
 GPS
 uh
 these
 kind
 of
 internet
 was


actually
 result
 of
 government
 finan


government
 uh
 uh
 controlled
 entities
 uh


research
 programs
 this
 has
 totally


changed
 now
 most
 of
 the
 advanced
 and


Technologies
 are
 developed
 in
 private
 uh


business
 in
 private
 companies
 AI
 uh


cyber
 the
 the
 whole
 Silicon
 Valley
 the


whole
 the
 whole
 and
 SpaceX
 all
 of
 these


things
 are
 now
 private
 so
 but
 but
 the


governments
 uh
 and
 our
 defense
 sector


which
 is
 of
 course
 still
 State


responsibilities
 are
 totally
 dependent


so
 we
 need
 to
 work
 with
 the
 private


business
 to
 ensure
 that
 um
 we
 keep
 as


militaries
 the
 the
 the
 the
 technological


lead
 to
 ensure
 that
 we
 have
 the
 best


armies
 in
 the
 future
 yes
 let's
 uh
 change


tag
 here
 and
 U
 move
 into
 happier


territories
 we
 have
 something
 in
 uh


Norway
 called
 the
 spending
 rule
 hling


reg
 which
 you
 first
 as
 a
 student
 of


Economics
 uh
 worked
 on
 then
 as
 a


minister
 of
 finance
 and
 prime
 minister


and
 so
 on
 and
 it's
 a
 rule
 which
 tells


how
 much
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign


wealth
 fund
 can
 be
 spent
 every
 year
 to


support
 the
 budget
 and
 it's
 really
 been


a
 Cornerstone
 in
 the
 economic
 planning


in
 this
 country
 now
 what
 what
 inspire


you
 to
 create
 this
 rule
 it
 was
 the


understanding
 that


Norway
 was
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of


revenues
 from
 the
 oil
 and
 gas
 and
 much


bigger
 revenues
 than
 we
 expected


um
 um
 and
 therefore
 when
 I
 was
 prime


minister
 in
 2000
 uh
 then
 we
 actually
 had


only
 net
 oil
 revenues
 only
 for
 a
 few


years
 the
 first
 net
 oil
 revenues
 came
 to


Norway
 in
 1996
 in
 the
 beginning
 they


were
 quite
 small
 uh
 then
 it
 was
 obvious


that
 uh
 we
 needed
 we
 needed
 some
 way


of
 uh
 deciding
 how
 much
 we
 could
 spend


and
 we
 were
 very
 afraid
 of
 uh
 what
 we


refer
 to
 as
 Dutch
 disease
 uh
 to
 spend


too
 much
 um
 and
 therefore
 we
 started


partly
 the
 kind
 of
 academic
 but
 also


then
 a
 political
 discussion
 on
 how
 to


establish
 a
 fiscal
 rule
 for
 how
 much
 of


the
 oil
 revenues
 we
 could
 spend
 and
 the


purpose
 was
 actually
 twofold
 one
 was
 to


ensure
 that
 uh
 not
 only
 Our
 Generation


but
 also
 future


Generations
 get
 the
 benefit
 uh
 of
 the


oil
 and
 gas
 resources
 that
 we
 are
 found


Onan
 continental


shelf
 uh
 that's
 a
 kind
 of
 long-term


perspective
 the
 other
 reason
 to
 uh


established
 a
 fiscal
 Rule
 and
 the
 and


the
 pension
 fund
 um
 was
 to
 ensure
 that


we
 could
 uh
 stabilize
 the
 economy
 to


separate
 earnings
 from
 spending
 and


prevent
 overheating
 of
 the
 uh
 economy


and
 therefore
 we
 we
 established
 the


pension
 fund
 and
 the
 first
 money
 was


allocated
 to
 the
 pension
 fund
 in
 96
 but


perhaps
 as
 important
 was
 this
 fiscal


rule
 where
 we
 decided
 that
 all
 the
 oil


and
 gas
 revenues
 uh


was
 going
 to
 go
 into
 norian
 pension
 fund


and
 then
 that
 the
 only
 thing
 we're
 going


to
 spend
 was
 the
 financial
 return
 uh


which
 we
 estimate
 to
 3%
 in
 yield
 terms


per
 year
 as
 an
 as
 an
 average
 and


therefore
 the
 fiscal
 R
 says
 that
 we


should
 only
 uh
 spend
 on
 average
 uh
 the


fiscal
 uh
 return
 3%
 estimated
 um
 uh
 and


um
 and
 that
 has
 served
 Norway
 very
 well


it's
 quite
 a
 Feit
 to
 manage
 to
 get
 um


political
 consensus
 around
 the
 spending


of
 such
 vast


resources
 uh
 and
 probably
 one
 of
 the


successes
 of
 uh
 well
 one
 of
 the
 main


successes
 of
 the
 fund
 uh
 has
 it
 worked


the
 way
 you
 thought
 yes
 and
 if
 anything


it
 worked
 even
 better
 uh
 uh
 uh
 because


uh
 partly
 because
 the
 fund
 has
 become


much
 bigger
 than
 we
 expected
 for
 many


reasons
 oil
 and
 gas
 production
 at
 thean


content
 Shelf
 has
 been
 bigger
 prices


have
 been
 higher
 and
 we
 also
 have
 good


Investments
 because
 of
 people
 like
 like


you
 have
 been
 able
 to
 manage
 the
 fund
 in


a
 very
 good
 way
 so
 the
 combination
 of


all
 these
 things
 have
 made
 the
 fund
 much


bigger
 and
 therefore
 also
 the
 fiscal


rule
 more
 important
 if
 you
 had
 at
 the


time
 when
 the
 fiscal
 rule
 was
 made
 had


also
 made
 a
 rule
 for
 how
 much
 uh
 in


total
 could
 the
 fund
 contribute
 to
 in


percent
 of
 the
 budget
 what
 do
 you
 think


that
 percentage
 would
 have
 been
 I
 think


it
 would
 have
 been
 lower
 than
 the


current
 percent
 which
 I
 think
 is
 now


25%
 or
 roughly
 almost
 one
 one
 quarter
 of


the
 norian
 state
 expenditure
 or
 state


budget
 is
 finan
 by
 the
 return
 from
 the


oil
 fund
 or
 from
 so
 instead
 of
 25
 what


do
 you
 think
 he
 would
 have
 been
 if
 you
 I


am
 not
 able
 I
 know
 I
 but
 but
 but
 but
 but


then
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 in
 a
 way
 as


I'm
 not
 able
 to
 give
 you
 an
 exact
 number


but
 I
 think
 it's
 also
 important
 to


understand
 that
 there
 are
 concerns
 and


I'm
 careful
 being
 going
 too
 much
 into


that
 debate
 because
 that's
 a
 very


Norwegian
 debate
 and
 I
 and
 I'm
 careful


being
 too
 specific
 on
 issues
 I
 not


worked
 so
 close
 with
 over
 the
 last
 years


but
 but
 I
 think
 the
 the
 idea
 back
 in


2000
 when
 we
 made
 the
 fiscal
 rule
 was
 in


a
 way
 that
 this
 was
 going
 to
 it
 could


last
 forever
 because
 in
 one
 way
 NATO
 has


sorry
 Norway
 has
 spent
 zero
 of
 the
 oil


uh
 revenues
 the
 only
 thing
 we
 have
 spent


is
 the
 fiscal
 return
 on
 the
 oil
 revenues


and
 um
 and
 and
 of
 course
 that
 can
 last


forever
 uh
 as
 long
 as
 we
 have
 the


installment
 the
 CH
 The
 Challenge
 and
 you


know
 that
 better
 than
 anyone
 one
 else
 is


that
 of
 course
 we
 now
 have
 some
 much
 our


wealth
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 then
 of


course
 there
 can
 be
 big
 fluctuations
 uh


that
 can
 have
 a
 impact
 on
 the
 Norwegian


economy
 and
 that's
 a
 new
 risk
 which
 we


didn't
 face
 at
 least
 not
 in
 the
 same
 way


uh
 uh
 before
 um
 uh
 so
 and
 and
 I'm
 always


a
 bit


careful
 um
 uh
 changing
 these
 kind
 of


fiscal
 rules
 too
 often
 because
 that
 will


undermine
 The


credibility
 uh
 perhaps
 it's
 better
 to


have
 an
 imperfect
 rule
 which
 is
 credible


than
 to
 always
 try
 to
 uh
 run
 for
 a
 more


perfect
 rule
 but
 which
 is
 um
 constantly


changed
 that
 will
 because
 this
 is
 this


is
 a
 self-imposed
 restriction
 and
 the


biggest
 success
 in
 a
 way
 is
 that
 a


Democratic
 Society
 as
 Norway
 has
 been


able
 to
 handle
 this
 enormous
 amount
 of


cash
 without
 spending
 it
 uh
 uh
 I


remember
 back
 in
 the
 1990s
 when
 we
 uh


had
 this
 discussion
 and
 started
 to


invest
 in
 in
 equities
 and
 and
 had
 the


first
 allocations
 to
 the
 pension
 fund


many
 experts
 also
 economists
 colleagues


of
 mine
 said
 this
 cannot
 happen
 the
 the


the
 Democratic
 institutions
 politicians


they
 will
 spend
 if
 they
 get
 the
 money


they
 will
 spend
 so
 they
 were
 actually
 in


favor
 of
 reducing
 the
 oil
 and
 gas


production
 to
 keep
 the
 wealth
 uh
 in
 the


continental
 shelf
 um
 and
 the
 actually


former
 Governor
 noran
 Central
 Bank
 bank


harm
 scan
 he
 led
 an
 expert
 group
 and


they


said
 it
 cannot
 work
 politician
 will


spend
 if
 they
 get
 the
 money
 we
 have


proven
 them
 wrong
 and
 that's
 the
 biggest


success
 and
 but
 but
 again
 if
 you
 start


to
 change
 these
 rules
 too
 often
 you
 may


undermine
 in
 a
 way
 the
 the
 magic
 of
 the


Line
 in
 the
 Sand
 which
 is
 which
 is
 the


the
 fiscal
 rule
 I
 think
 we
 can
 say
 Well


done
 norian
 politicians
 and
 well
 done


the
 Minister
 of
 Finance
 and
 the


management
 and
 the
 the
 the
 NB
 and
 all


those
 who
 have
 been
 irresponsible
 yes
 we


talked
 about
 how
 the
 world
 has
 changed


since
 since
 you
 wrote
 this
 book
 uh
 how


have
 you


changed
 I've
 been
 I've
 become
 I
 to
 say


more
 realistic
 about
 the
 the
 dangers
 I
 I


I
 I
 have
 always
 been
 extremely


optimistic
 and
 and
 embrace
 the
 world
 and


free
 trade
 and
 openness
 I'm
 less
 that


guy
 now
 uh
 because
 I've
 seen
 the


backside
 of
 that
 uh
 medal
 or
 that
 coin


and
 I've
 been
 as
 I've
 always
 been
 in


favor
 of
 the
 transatlantic
 Bond
 North


America
 and
 Europe
 together
 but
 of


course
 being
 in
 NATO
 for
 10
 years
 I
 I'm


more
 aware
 of
 the
 importance
 so
 I'm
 more


I'm
 more
 I
 say
 even
 more
 committed
 to


that


idea
 I'm
 10
 years
 older
 and
 and
 first


and
 foremost
 not
 first
 and
 foremost
 but


but
 in
 on
 top
 of
 that
 for
 the
 first
 time


in
 my
 life
 I'm
 I'm
 in
 one
 way
 free


meaning
 that
 and
 that's
 not
 only
 a
 good


thing
 I
 always
 worked
 in
 public
 sector


uh
 as
 an
 economist
 as
 a
 politician
 and


in
 NATO
 which
 is
 also
 public
 sector
 and


now
 I'm
 I'm
 back
 in
 Norway
 and
 start
 a


new
 life
 which
 is
 very
 different
 from


the
 life
 I
 lived
 up
 to
 now
 and
 that's
 a


danger
 it's
 it's
 scary
 but
 also
 a
 good


thing
 yeah
 you
 mentioned
 that
 um
 both


you
 and
 R
 had
 worked
 in
 a
 multi


multi-party
 system
 you
 know
 with
 lots
 of


parties
 uh
 you
 have
 to
 work
 with
 the


union
 and
 so
 on
 now
 how
 that
 experience


how
 has
 that
 made
 you
 a
 better
 Diplomat


and
 negotiator
 you
 think
 well
 I
 think
 I


think
 that's
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 I


I
 brought
 with
 me
 to
 to
 n
 to
 and
 the


most
 important
 thing
 that
 Mar
 brings
 uh


with
 him
 to
 Nato
 is
 this
 of
 leading


something
 where
 you
 have
 to
 find


compromises
 I
 think
 I've
 never
 been
 a


CEO
 but
 I
 think
 when
 when
 you
 are
 a
 CEO


just
 make
 decisions
 that's
 at
 least
 my


my
 my
 my
 impression
 in
 a
 private
 company


and
 you
 have
 a
 very
 clear
 mandate
 when


you're
 a
 prime
 minister
 especially
 in
 a


multiparty
 governments
 uh
 and
 with
 not


clear
 ma
 majority
 in
 the
 in
 the


parliament
 which
 is
 the
 case
 in
 more
 and


more
 at
 least
 European
 countries
 then


you
 need
 to
 find
 compromises
 every
 day


that's
 just
 the
 the
 the
 the
 rule
 of
 of


of
 the
 game
 and
 and
 and
 that's
 also
 when


you
 are
 the
 boss
 in
 NATO
 that's
 the
 same


you
 have
 uh
 not
 many
 parties
 but
 you


have
 32
 different
 countries
 and
 they
 all


have
 to
 agree
 because
 you
 talk
 about


beautiful
 compromises
 most
 people
 don't


think
 compromises
 are
 so
 beautiful
 but


you
 you
 really
 like
 them
 yeah
 I
 like


them
 partly
 because
 I
 think
 that
 very


often
 actually
 the
 solution
 is
 better


when
 you
 make
 a
 compromise
 uh
 uh
 um
 then


you
 then
 you
 find
 something
 which


balance
 different
 interests
 and
 and
 and


and
 and
 that's
 very
 often
 the
 best


solution
 to
 take
 into
 account
 different


interest
 different
 views
 but
 second


that's
 the
 only
 way
 to
 make
 decisions


and
 to
 and
 to
 move
 forward
 and
 and
 our


Democratic
 societies
 are
 compromises


between
 capital
 and
 labor
 between
 right


and
 left
 between
 different
 political


views
 um
 and
 overall
 I
 believe
 that


these
 open
 societies
 uh
 with
 different


interest
 are
 better
 than
 extreme


societies
 that
 uh
 just
 adad
 to
 one


religion
 or
 one
 political
 ideology
 M
 now


now
 uh
 Nordic
 leadership
 style
 is
 also


more
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 flatter
 style
 it's


more
 about
 consensus
 and
 so
 on
 was
 that


also
 something
 you
 brought
 into
 NATO


yeah
 yes
 I
 brought
 it
 into
 NATO
 but
 it


was
 less
 conscious
 than
 I
 than
 I
 was


aware
 of
 because
 I
 just
 brought
 the
 way


I
 have
 led
 norian
 governments
 uh
 for
 10


years
 uh
 I
 brought
 that
 same
 culture
 to


to
 Nato
 um
 I
 afterwards
 or
 after
 some


years
 after
 some
 some
 time
 I
 realized


that
 that
 was
 the
 some
 extent
 a
 new


style
 uh
 but
 I
 believe
 in
 talking
 to


people
 having
 open
 access
 to
 people
 and


to
 also
 be
 frank
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 much


easier
 to
 have
 good
 decisions
 when
 the


people
 you
 work
 with
 actually
 have
 the


courage
 of
 telling
 you
 that
 you
 are


wrong
 or
 we
 have
 to
 do
 something


different
 or
 this
 doesn't
 work
 instead


of
 people
 are
 afraid
 of
 criticizing
 or


or
 or
 being
 frank
 and
 open
 with
 you
 you


ran
 this
 country
 um
 during
 the
 July


attack
 uh
 the
 terror
 attacks
 that
 had


and
 you
 know
 through
 the
 Ukraine


situation
 in
 NATO
 what
 are


the
 how
 does
 one
 lead
 uh
 during
 these


traumatic
 situations
 what's
 the
 key
 to


sto
 it's
 to
 remain
 calm
 in
 a
 way
 um
 and


to
 and
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 sleep
 uh
 uh


uh
 because
 U
 it
 is
 important
 to
 be
 able


to
 function
 uh
 so
 I've
 seen
 some
 people


in
 crisis
 exhausting
 thems
 too
 early
 uh


so
 so
 you
 need
 to
 protect
 yourself
 self


um
 that
 may
 sound
 a
 bit
 egoistic
 but
 but


I
 think
 if
 a
 leader
 shall
 function
 uh
 uh


over
 time
 you
 need
 to
 ensure
 that
 you


get
 the
 support
 the
 help
 so
 you
 can
 do


what
 you
 have
 to
 do
 as
 a
 leader
 to
 be


there
 uh
 to
 formulate
 uh
 a
 message
 to
 to


uh
 to
 be
 present
 especially
 in
 the


public
 domain
 for
 a
 political
 leader
 and


therefore
 also
 need
 not
 to
 be
 shy
 to
 ask


for
 help
 and
 support
 M
 how
 do
 you
 work


with


feelings
 I'm
 a
 bit
 strange
 there
 because


because
 when
 the
 crisis
 are
 acute
 i
 i
 i


suppress
 them
 I
 just
 keep
 them
 away
 and


and
 in
 one
 way
 I
 think
 that
 helps
 me


dealing
 with
 uh
 feelings
 um
 um
 so
 I


remember
 especially
 in
 2022
 no
 sorry
 in


in
 in
 in
 2011
 the
 terrorist
 attacks
 on


the
 22nd
 of
 of
 July
 friends
 of
 mine
 were


killed
 uh
 people
 I
 knew
 very
 well
 worked


with
 were


killed
 but
 I
 didn't
 fully
 take
 that
 into


as
 I
 say
 myself
 until
 days
 after
 uh


because
 I
 think
 actually
 the
 fact
 that
 I


had
 the
 role
 to
 play
 that
 I
 had
 to
 lead


that
 I
 had
 to
 give
 speeches
 to
 be


present
 to
 give
 Comfort
 to
 those
 who


have
 lost
 their
 loved
 ones
 that
 helped


me
 to
 deal
 with
 my
 feelings
 um
 of
 course


it's
 not
 a
 sustainable
 way
 you
 canot
 do


that
 forever
 but
 for
 at
 least
 the
 first


days
 to
 have
 a
 task
 help
 me
 to
 deal
 with


my
 own
 feelings
 is
 it
 lonely


it
 is
 lonely
 but
 but
 perhaps
 less
 lonely


that's
 that
 people
 believe
 Al
 I
 and


that's
 a
 party
 up
 to
 yourself
 I
 I
 think


if
 anything
 I'm
 quite
 good
 at
 at
 asking


for
 help
 asking
 for
 advice
 calling


people
 asking
 them
 to
 come
 uh
 to
 talk
 to


them
 and
 uh
 about
 the
 big
 things
 the


Small
 Things
 the
 feelings
 uh
 and
 I
 think


it's
 a
 bit
 up
 to
 yourself
 as
 a
 leader
 to


be
 able
 to
 open
 up
 and
 uh
 accept
 people


into
 your
 life
 and
 I
 if
 there's
 anything


I'm
 quite
 good
 at
 is
 to
 uh
 allow
 people


to
 help
 me
 who
 do
 you
 who
 do
 you
 allow


to
 help
 you
 almost
 everyone
 as
 meaning


of
 course
 those
 who
 are
 closest
 to
 me
 uh


working
 with
 me
 um
 family
 members
 my


wife
 um
 but
 but
 they
 can
 also
 be
 you


know
 more
 or
 less
 random
 person
 who
 are


there
 if
 I
 have
 a
 if
 I
 have
 some
 makeup


before
 a
 TV
 show
 or
 something
 I
 can
 ask


all
 those
 what
 do
 you
 think
 about
 this


what
 do
 you
 think
 about
 that
 so
 so
 I


think
 it's
 about
 the
 openness
 to
 advice


not
 be
 afraid
 of
 uh
 of
 of
 getting
 advice


now
 uh
 you
 may
 not
 particularly
 want
 to


talk
 about
 it
 but
 you
 have
 uh
 this


incredible
 presence
 right
 uh
 one
 of
 the


most
 incredible
 presences
 I've
 seen
 and


you
 know
 I
 was
 so
 lucky
 I
 came
 down
 to


brussells
 to
 have
 dinner
 with
 you
 and


you
 you
 live
 you
 lived
 in
 this
 gated


community
 and
 I
 you
 know
 I
 had
 dinner


with
 you
 at
 7:00
 came
 me
 through
 the


gate
 walked
 for
 50
 m
 and
 then
 there
 is


one
 person
 standing
 on
 the
 street


welcoming
 me
 yeah
 and
 that's
 you
 yeah


and
 you
 are
 the
 Secretary
 General
 of


NATO
 and
 a
 very
 very
 important
 man
 and
 I


just
 felt
 you
 know
 a
 bit
 overwhelmed
 by


that
 experience
 but
 I
 like
 I
 like
 people


I
 like
 you
 and
 and
 that's
 natural
 thing


for
 me
 to
 go
 out
 and
 say
 Hello
 uh
 and


uh
 but
 who
 taught
 you
 that
 how
 did
 you


pick
 it
 up
 no
 I
 never
 that
 who
 who
 P
 how


did
 you
 pick
 it
 up
 it
 just
 Falls
 natural


for
 me
 uh
 it
 may
 be
 that
 I
 learned
 it


more
 from
 my
 father
 than
 I'm
 aware
 of


because
 he
 was
 also
 very
 open
 for
 know


to
 like
 people
 and
 I
 and
 I
 think
 it's


impossible
 to
 be
 a
 politician
 without


liking
 to
 be
 together
 with
 people
 to
 app


I
 get
 energy
 from
 being
 together
 with


with
 people
 it's
 not
 a
 cost
 it's


something
 actually
 gives
 me
 something


that
 that
 when
 I'm
 together
 with
 with


with
 people
 um
 then
 of
 course
 sometimes


I
 also
 need
 to
 rest
 and
 then
 I
 just
 I


leave
 as
 I
 go
 maybe
 a
 sudden
 I
 go
 early


to
 bed
 or
 I
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 uh
 attend


reception
 or
 or
 or
 dinner
 but
 but
 or
 I


go
 in
 the
 weekends
 I
 can
 go
 out
 in


norian
 forest
 or
 and
 iow
 to
 be
 alone
 or


only
 together
 with
 my
 wife
 or
 close


friend
 but
 but
 in
 general
 it's
 it's


something
 that
 actually
 gives
 me
 energy


to
 be
 together
 with
 people
 talking
 about


um
 people
 just
 how
 you
 at
 NATO
 you've


been
 dealing
 with
 um
 you
 know
 people
 who


are
 perceived
 to
 have
 you
 know
 large
 uh


egos
 I
 guess
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 reaching


consensus
 with
 them
 and
 getting
 to


agreement
 no
 I
 think
 it's
 about
 taking


their
 concerns
 seriously
 and
 to
 even
 if


we
 disagree
 on
 many
 issues
 we
 may
 they


may
 Al
 actually
 also
 have
 relevant


points
 and
 uh
 and
 concerns
 and
 uh


without
 being
 too
 specific
 of
 course


there
 have
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 attention
 of


how
 did
 we
 manage
 four
 years
 of
 uh


president
 Trump
 in
 the
 white
 house
 um


and
 and
 and
 it's
 no
 no
 secret
 that
 I


disagree
 with
 him
 on
 trade
 and
 or


abortion
 or
 or
 climate
 change
 but
 that


is
 that
 was
 not
 core
 issues
 for
 NATO
 so


what
 I
 focused
 on
 was
 what
 matters
 for


NATO
 and
 actually
 on
 those
 issues
 we


were
 had
 yeah
 a
 large
 degree
 of


agreement
 his
 main
 message
 was
 that


European
 all
 had
 to
 invest
 more
 in


events
 he
 conveyed
 that
 message
 in
 a
 way


which
 was
 a
 bit
 say
 not
 as
 didn't
 use


conver
 different
 than
 than
 many
 other


political
 leaders
 but
 but
 the
 core
 of


that
 message
 was
 something
 was


absolutely
 the
 same
 as
 President
 Obama


had
 done
 before
 him
 or
 President
 Biden


does
 now
 uh
 and
 I
 took
 that
 concern


seriously
 and
 I
 think
 that
 helped
 the


same
 with
 with
 with
 President
 erogan


people
 asked
 me
 how
 how
 does
 that
 work


well
 he
 has
 expressed
 serious
 concerns


about
 the
 fact
 that
 no
 other
 country


NATO
 all
 country
 have
 suffered
 more


terrorist
 attacks
 than
 than
 than
 turkey


so
 take
 that
 seriously
 so
 I
 think
 focus


on
 the
 issues
 uh
 uh
 that's
 the
 best
 way


of
 uh
 uh


addressing
 strong
 political
 leaders


you're
 now
 back
 in
 Oso
 how
 does
 it
 feel


it's
 great
 to
 be
 back
 in
 Oso
 uh
 it's
 a


sunny
 fall
 day
 it's
 not
 always
 sunny
 in


Norway
 but
 it
 is
 actually
 I
 like
 Norway


I
 like
 Oso
 this
 is
 the
 time
 this
 is
 the


town
 where
 I'm
 born
 and
 grew
 up
 uh
 uh


have
 my
 family
 my
 wife
 here
 uh
 uh
 so


that's
 that's
 that's
 that's
 great
 uh


it's
 a
 bit
 different
 of
 course
 uh
 but


it's
 a
 new
 life
 and
 and
 it's
 fascinating


uh
 to
 open
 a
 new
 chapter
 of
 my
 life
 why


is
 the
 forest
 so
 important
 for
 you


because
 for
 me
 nature
 is
 a
 place
 to
 be
 a


bit
 alone
 uh
 or
 to
 together
 with
 one
 or


two
 a
 persons
 in
 be
 close
 with
 them
 it's


a
 way
 to
 both
 just
 relax
 but
 also
 to


exercise
 and
 then
 of
 course
 it's
 nice
 to


go
 out
 and
 have
 dinners
 but
 actually
 one


of
 the
 best
 ways
 to
 be
 together
 with
 all


the
 people
 it's
 for
 me
 just
 to
 walk
 and


we
 talk
 and
 we
 walk
 for
 half
 an
 hour
 or


3
 hours
 uh
 and
 but
 you
 also
 cook
 yeah
 I


cook
 because
 I
 hunt
 I
 hunt
 Okay
 no
 I
 am


I
 the
 very
 strange
 thing
 I
 my
 family
 has


has
 no
 what
 should
 I
 say
 had
 no
 interest


for
 hunting
 but
 then
 when
 when
 I
 was
 50


I
 had
 some
 50
 years
 crisis
 as
 we
 called


in
 Norway
 so
 then
 I
 started
 to
 do


strange
 things
 including
 climbing
 some


mountains
 which
 was
 something
 I
 never


did
 before
 uh
 and
 starting
 also
 to
 hunt


which
 was
 a
 totally
 new
 experience
 and


then
 I
 hunt
 uh
 the
 three
 or
 four
 days


every
 year
 and
 uh
 often
 I
 don't
 shoot


anything
 uh
 but
 sometimes
 I
 able
 to


shoot
 a
 Norwegian
 reindeer
 yeah
 and
 then


I
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 specialities
 is
 then
 to


prepare
 the
 reinder
 for
 friends
 yeah
 and


I
 was
 lucky
 enough
 to
 be
 at
 one
 of
 those


dinners
 but
 the
 the
 thing
 that
 really


impressed
 me
 was
 that
 you
 served
 Earl


Gray
 ice
 tea
 no
 Earl
 Gray
 ice
 cream


which
 you
 had
 made
 yourself
 yeah
 but


that's
 now
 this
 is
 a
 very
 good
 podcast


because
 now
 we
 get
 all
 the
 best


information
 about
 me
 because
 I
 I
 when
 I


lived
 in
 in
 NATO
 I
 had
 the
 privilege
 of


having
 a
 chef
 in
 the
 house
 of
 course


there
 were
 lot
 of
 dinners
 and
 and


representation
 and
 so
 on
 but
 they
 also


prepared
 uh
 food
 for
 me
 and
 uh
 and


especially
 during
 the
 corona
 we
 were
 a


bit
 stuck
 in
 that
 house
 um
 so
 I
 spent


more
 time
 in
 the
 house
 than
 than
 than


normal
 uh
 and
 then
 I
 started
 to
 actually


learn
 from
 him
 how
 to
 cook
 I'm
 not
 a


chef
 uh
 and
 there
 many
 very
 few
 dishes


I'm
 able
 to
 to
 to
 to
 make
 but
 for


instance
 to
 make
 my
 own
 homemade
 ice


cream
 I'm
 actually
 bought
 a
 machine
 uh


so
 I
 can
 make
 quite
 good
 ice
 cream
 uh


and
 it's
 not
 so
 difficult
 but
 it's
 nice


to
 serve
 ice
 cream
 which
 you
 have


prepared
 yourself
 and
 the
 Norwegian


population
 and
 the


European
 uh
 population
 should
 uh
 make


food
 for
 you
 every
 day
 because
 you
 have


uh
 served
 uh
 the
 country
 and
 Europe
 and


made
 it
 a
 safer
 place
 so
 uh
 big
 thanks


for
 doing
 that
 and
 big
 thanks
 for
 being


here
 today
 no
 thanks
 so
 much


oh
