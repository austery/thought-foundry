- [Derek] What would happen
if you dropped a penny
off the Empire State Building?
Could it kill someone walking
on the sidewalk below?
What does it take to
create a deadly projectile?
Well, I'm gonna put this to the test
with original MythBuster Adam Savage.
He's going up in a helicopter
to throw pennies at me.
No one hasn't heard that story.
- When you talk about it,
people are like, "Oh yeah,
the penny from the Empire State Building."
And when we went to the
Empire State Building,
every ledge below the observation deck
is filled with change.
I just love the idea of all these people.
They're not murderers, but they're like,
it's probably not true.
They're like throwing
pennies over the side
thinking it's probably not true.
- [Derek] A penny weighs
around two and a half grams,
which is about half to a
quarter the weight of a bullet.
If you ignore air resistance,
a penny dropped from the
Empire State Building,
which is 443 meters to the very top,
would accelerate to over
300 kilometers per hour
by the time it hits the ground.
That's around half as
fast as a typical bullet.
The MythBusters made contraptions
to shoot pennies at each other.
- Stephen Colbert shot me in
the ass with it a few times.
- How did it feel?
It's a baseball pitcher
throwing a penny hard at you.
- Yeah.
- It'll sting.
- [Derek] But they never
tried the ultimate test.
Dropping pennies
from the height of the
Empire State Building
onto someone below.
And that's what we're
gonna do here with Adam.
- That'd be great watching
it bounce off your body.
- [Derek] Yeah, yeah.
- I say this thinking it's
always been my body until now.
First one, I'll drop the pennies
to see where it's gonna land.
You're gonna walk there.
I'll throw a second one,
that's good for you.
- Yeah.
- And then you're ready for the full dump.
- Yep.
(tense music)
(helicopter engine revving)
- I'm going underneath helicopter
where Adam Savage is gonna
drop a whole bunch of pennies
on me.
What are we even doing?
I know I agreed to do this
and I didn't think I'd get hurt,
but as I'm walking out
under the helicopter,
I started to think, no one
has actually done this.
We planned for pennies
falling through still air,
but the helicopter
creates a huge downdraft
to support its weight.
- In 3, 2, 1.
- Oh boy, I hear them landing around me.
I start to imagine pennies
gouging into my shoulders.
You can see how tense my body looks.
- Ah, one hit my helmet
in 3, 2, 1.
- Aaaaaa-hahaha-owwww,
that hit my shoulder.
AAAAaAAh.
(slow-motion screaming)
- That's really good.
In 3, 2, 1.
- They feel like tiny little bullets.
I feel like I'm gonna
be bruised after this.
Oh boy.
Okay, I'm laying down, I'm going for it.
- Here we go, doing the whole thing.
In 3, 2, 1.
(Guitar riff)
Unbelievable.
There you have it.
A penny dropped from the
Empire State Building
is not gonna hurt.
I mean it hurts a little, but not a lot.
You'll be alright.
- That was great.
I saw little dust clouds all around you.
- Amazing.
- Tell me what it was like down here.
- I was terrified.
I got out there and the
rotor wash is so heavy.
I'm like, maybe we haven't
calculated for rotor wash.
It stung to get hit by
pennies falling that far,
but it certainly wasn't fatal.
(upbeat music)
So why aren't pennies more dangerous?
Well, the reason is air resistance.
- [David Scott] And I'll
drop the two of 'em here
and hopefully they'll hit
the ground at the same time.
- Take the classic experiment
of a hammer and feather
dropped simultaneously on the moon.
In the near vacuum of the moon's surface,
both objects speed up at the same rate
due to the moon's gravity,
and they're both still accelerating
when they hit the ground at the same time.
- [David Scott] How 'bout that?
- Repeat the experiment on earth.
And of course, the hammer
lands way before the feather.
If you watch the feather closely,
you'll notice that it
doesn't speed up as it falls.
For most of its journey,
it's moving at a constant speed
known as its terminal velocity.
Terminal velocity is reached
when the force of gravity
pulling an object down
is equal to the force of air
resistance pushing it up.
In this case,
which object, the hammer or the feather,
experiences a greater
force of air resistance.
Well, I bet most people
would say the feather
because its motion is
clearly affected by drag.
But the answer is actually the hammer.
Air resistance is
proportional to speed squared
and the hammer gets going
much faster than the feather
so it experiences the larger
force of air resistance,
but its weight is so much greater
that drag is negligible in comparison.
And that's why the
hammer keeps speeding up
while the feather reaches
terminal velocity early
and just stays at that speed.
It all comes down to the ratio
of weight to air resistance.
Every object has its
own terminal velocity,
the maximum speed it will reach
in free fall through still air.
And I went indoor skydiving
to experience this first hand.
That was so amazing,
that was totally wild.
Objects that have the same size and shape
experience the same air resistance.
But if one is heavier, here
I've got two identical balls,
but this one has water added
to it, so it's heavier,
then it has a higher terminal velocity
so it doesn't float at the same wind speed
as the lighter object.
Conversely,
some objects are very
different in size and shape
like a person and a lacrosse ball,
and obviously they have
very different weights,
but they also experience very different
forces of air resistance.
And the key thing is that
the ratio of their weight
to air resistance is
the same for both bodies
so they have the same terminal velocity,
which means they will both
float together in the tunnel.
If you transported the sky
diver and lacrosse ball
to the stratosphere,
they would continue to fall together,
but their joint terminal
velocity would be much faster.
In 2012, Felix Baumgartner
jumped from a weather balloon
39 kilometers above sea level.
After just 40 seconds of free fall,
he reached a terminal velocity
over 1300 kilometers per hour.
It was 25% faster than the speed of sound
making him the first person
to break the sound barrier
outside of a vehicle.
What allowed him to do
this was the lack of air
at that altitude.
Air resistance is directly proportional
to the density of air
you're moving through.
And at that altitude,
the air is 60 times less
dense than at sea level.
As he continued falling
into thicker atmosphere,
the increasing air density
reduced his terminal velocity
and by two and a half
kilometers above sea level,
he had slowed to 200 kilometers per hour,
at which point he opened his parachute.
Now rain also falls kilometers,
but through the thicker
air of the troposphere.
One of the coolest
things in the wind tunnel
was to see water floating.
Poured from a jug,
it quickly breaks up into droplets
the same size as raindrops
from around 0.5 to four
millimeters in diameter.
And standing there,
you can experience what it would be like
to fall with raindrops.
(soft music)
They have a low terminal velocity
of just 25 kilometers per hour
and that's what the wind speed was set to
for this demonstration.
And what you can see
is that raindrops aren't
shaped like cartoon raindrops.
They are closer to spherical,
but a bit flatter on the bottom
where they encounter oncoming air.
If a raindrop gets too big,
it flattens out, caves in in the middle
and briefly resembles a little parachute
before breaking up into smaller droplets.
So raindrops aren't damaging,
but it's a different story for hail.
(hail hitting the ground)
- [Man] I just completely
lost my windshield right here.
- [Derek] Every year in the US,
hail injures around 20 people
and since 2000 it's
caused four fatalities.
That's because hail can
reach terminal velocities
of over 200 kilometers per hour.
That's around 10 times the
terminal velocity of rain.
But why is its terminal
velocity so much higher
even though ice itself
is slightly less dense
than liquid water?
The main thing is that
hail can get much bigger
than a raindrop.
Hailstones have been
measured up to 20 centimeters
in diameter.
Now drag is proportional
to cross sectional area,
so it scales with radius squared,
whereas weight scales with radius cubed.
So the bigger the hailstone,
the faster its terminal velocity.
It also has more mass,
so it carries even more kinetic energy
and packs a bigger punch
when it hits something.
Pennies reach terminal
velocity after falling
only around 15 meters.
You can see in this shot the
average speed of the pennies
in the top of the frame
is the same as at the bottom of the frame.
They aren't speeding up.
They've reached terminal velocity.
So it wouldn't matter if
pennies were dropped on you
from 15 meters or 300
meters or 3000 meters,
it would feel the same
because they would be
going the same speed.
In fact, we didn't take the helicopter
all the way up to Empire
State Building height
because that wouldn't have increased
the speed of the pennies at all
and it would've just
made aiming much harder.
- By the end, I'm throwing to account
for this secondary air current
that's moving between
you and the helicopter.
And so the pennies are
making this like 12 foot arc
all the way over and then coming back.
- [Derek] One of the reasons
pennies are so hard to aim
is because they flutter
and tumble as they fall.
This tumbling behavior means
pennies don't actually have
a single terminal velocity.
- A penny actually has
two terminal velocities
and it oscillates between them.
So it's got one on its
face and one on its edge.
I've got a wind tunnel that can show you
exactly how that works.
It's really beautiful.
- [Derek] I gotta see that.
- Yeah, it's really neat.
- Throw to the...
- Yeah.
- [Derek] Adam built a custom wind tunnel
to witness this for himself.
So I went to San Francisco
to his cave to check it out.
- This is literally like my
MythBusters origin story,
this device.
I'm so delighted to fire this up again.
- It's like looking at a
piece of piece of history.
How old is this?
- 19 years old now.
- It's old enough to drive
and vote, but not drink.
- There's people watching this video,
you know?
- Yeah.
- Who weren't alive when
you were making this.
- [Derek] Because of the holes
which allow air to escape,
this wind tunnel has a
gradient of wind speeds
from around a hundred kilometers
per hour at the bottom
up to 25 kilometers per hour at the top.
- This creates a little
bit of back pressure
that popsicle, the tongue
depressors up here,
and that back pressure is
relieved by these holes enough
so that the penny spins.
- [Derek] If a penny really has
two different terminal velocities,
it should oscillate up and
down in this wind tunnel
as a result.
- There you go.
(sound of air rushing by)
- That's amazing to see
it oscillate, right?
- I know.
The fact that it goes up and down
and then comes back up again.
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.
- It was just hanging out like that.
- When in 2003 I dropped
the penny on the top
and it went up and down, like I'm still,
every single time I tell
that story, I get goosebumps
because I remember that
feeling of like, Oh wow.
- [Derek] We made a separate
video on Adam's channel
that discusses the wind
tunnel in more detail.
So check it out after this.
So the reason pennies aren't dangerous
is because their terminal
velocity is at most
about 80 kilometers per hour.
Yeah, it's not gonna hurt you.
- That's busted.
- Right.
(both laughing)
- Think I'm allowed to say like.
- Like old habit.
(both laughing)
But something more aerodynamic
would have a higher terminal velocity.
And this has led some to
suggest ballpoint pens
falling from a skyscraper
like the Empire State Building
could be lethal.
- But supposedly.
- Yeah, a pen, a ballpoint pen.
- Is as dangerous as a penny
is mythically dangerous?
- Yeah, yeah, like that's.
Is meant to actually be lethal.
- It's worth really trying.
- [Derek] These pens weigh
about twice as much as a penny
and they have a smaller
cross-sectional area.
- All right, I'm gonna
start the first drop.
- [Derek] So this will increase
the ratio of weight to drag,
but will it be enough?
Now, because I'm not
sure what will happen,
I'm not putting my body
on the line for this one.
Instead we'll use a ballistics gel dummy.
- Here we go.
In 3, 2, 1.
Oh, that's very close.
Back up again (murmuring)
3, 2, 1.
Oh oh, very close, very close.
Here we go, 3, 2, 1.
Oh, oh, almost.
Okay, 3, 2, 1.
Oh, almost.
3, 2, 1.
Okay, last one.
3, 2, 1.
Ah, over.
- That might be it
- Yeah, we're outta pens
(helicopter revving)
The second to last drop,
we had almost no crosswinds at all.
So they dropped perfectly down
and kind of hit right below where we were
and they were all cattywampus.
If the myth was true, I would
expect to see this everywhere.
- [Derek] Right.
- [Adam] Right?
That's what I would expect to see.
And I don't see a single one
and I didn't after we dropped 'em all.
- Are you gonna call it I?
- (laughs) I will, sure.
I'll come back outta
retirement to say busted.
Pens are not dangerous
falling from tall objects.
Ball point pens with their caps off.
- [Derek] Narrow metal pens
might still be dangerous,
but these plastic ones still
seem to have too much drag
relative to their weight
for them to achieve
a high terminal velocity.
One of the curious things
about air resistance
is that it depends not only
on the cross sectional area
of the object, but also
on its overall shape.
This dependence is captured
in a dimensionless number
known as the Drag Coefficient.
The Drag Coefficient is all about
how smoothly air can flow around an object
and without creating vortices.
The word bullet comes from
the French boule meaning ball.
So a boulette is a small ball,
exactly what the earliest bullets were.
But the drag Coefficient
of a sphere is 0.5
so people modified the
shape to reduce drag
and eventually, they settled
on a modern bullet shape,
which has a drag coefficient
between 0.1 and 0.3.
So drag coefficient is the reason a bullet
is no longer a boulette.
So what would happen
if you dropped a bullet
from a skyscraper?
Not what you'd expect.
Instead of falling pointy side down,
a bullet would tumble and likely
end up falling on its side.
- The thing is that cylinders
tend to fall on their sides
if given enough chance.
- Really?
- But the object falls
in relation to the highest resistance.
It ends up finding the highest resistance
as the most stable.
- Why doesn't it fall
in lowest resistance?
- I know.
- That seems intuitive.
- Bullets, if you let them,
they'll fall and make bullet shape holes--
- On their side.
A bullet fired straight up
slows down as its kinetic energy
is turned into gravitational energy.
And at its highest point,
which could be up to
three kilometers high,
it stops and then falls back down.
At that moment, it's just
like dropping a bullet
from a really tall building.
As it starts to fall,
it will tumble and so it
experiences far more air resistance
than on the way up.
And so it's not gonna get
back a lot of that energy
that went into its height,
which means that by the
time it reaches the ground,
it will be much slower than it was shot.
Now if the bullet isn't
fired completely vertical,
then it poses much greater danger.
At the peak of its trajectory,
only the vertical component
of velocity is zero.
It still maintains its
horizontal velocity,
and that combined with the
spin imparted to the bullet
by the grooves inside the gun barrel,
keep it moving pointy and forwards.
And so as the bullet
comes back to the ground,
it speeds up to a significant
fraction of its launch speed.
There are hundreds of cases
of people being struck
and killed by celebratory
gunfire from all over the world.
Now this is accidental,
but the concept of dropping
deadly projectiles on enemies
is almost as old as aircraft.
In World War I,
these little pieces of metal
were dropped out of planes
and they look like nails with
little feathers on the back
to make sure they fall straight.
They're called fléchettes,
which is French for little arrow,
but some were up to 15 centimeters long.
- That is great.
I totally wanna make a
thing that shoots these.
(Derek laughing)
- And how big were these things?
- About the size of a dart,
a little heavier than a standard pub dart.
And there were like
endless different shapes.
- [Derek] From a military perspective,
the advantages were they
didn't require any explosives
and they were cheap to
produce and deploy at scale.
They could pierce helmets
leading to enemy casualties
and some nasty injuries.
- They found darts that
had gone through a rider
and his horse.
- That's insane.
- But I also just love the idea
of a guy in an open cockpit,
cloth and wood plane just
hurling handfuls of darts out.
That is like a 10 year old's
idea of warfare, right?
Then I'm gonna hit him with darts.
- Later, the US created similar
weapons called Lazy Dogs,
which were a bit heftier
used in the Korean
and Vietnam wars.
The damage they inflicted
was indiscriminate
and unpredictable,
but at least they didn't
leave unexploded ordinances
in the field.
And militaries continue to use
kinetic projectiles to this day,
For example, to make precision
strikes on terrorist leaders.
Falling objects are also
dangerous in civilian life.
Nearly 700 Americans die each year
by being struck by a falling object.
These range from loose tiles and bricks
to falling construction tools,
falling rocks and tree branches,
and even icicles.
Death by icicle is rare
but they were a serious enough concern
that in the winter of 2014,
streets around New York's
One World Trade Center
were closed due to the danger caused
by icicles hanging on the building.
So which projectiles are
lethal and which aren't?
Honestly, a lot of them are.
The lower limit of the energy required
to fracture a human skull
is around 68 Joules.
So anything that has kinetic
energy greater than that
is very likely to kill you.
A raindrop at terminal
velocity with its tiny mass
will only deliver 2000th of a Joule.
A falling penny has
about a fifth of a Joule.
But a baseball and the
largest hailstone measured
deliver more than 80 Joules.
That is plenty to crack your skull.
In 2014, a man was killed
when he was hit by a
falling measuring tape
that had fallen 50 stories.
And this is just calculating
for blunt force trauma.
The energy stored in a falling Flechette
is not enough to crack your skull,
but it can apply a large
force to a very small area.
So yeah,
a penny falling from the
Empire State Building
won't kill you.
A pen likely won't either.
Anything that weighs a few
grams and isn't aerodynamic
isn't going to be fatal.
But objects that weigh more
than a few hundred grams
traveling at terminal velocity
are likely to be deadly.

You have made it to
this part of the video,
which means you like learning stuff.
And I wanna tell you one thing
that will help you learn even more.
Right now for free,
you can get started with
my favorite learning tool
and the sponsor of this video, Brilliant,
by going to brilliant.org/veritasium,
link in the description.
So why should you try Brilliant?
Well, because it allows you to learn
a wide range of STEM concepts
in an interactive way.
They have advanced topics like calculus
and gravitational physics.
But if you need a refresher,
they also have fundamentals
of algebra or computer science
or logic.
There are so many courses to choose from.
You know, people sometimes ask
why I don't show more equations
or work through numerical
examples in my videos.
And the reason is I don't think
that's really where video shines.
I did my PhD on how to make
videos to teach physics,
and I think they're a great way to inspire
and excite people about science.
But if you actually want
to develop expertise
and problem solving skills,
you need to try things out for yourself.
And that's where Brilliant comes in.
You can experiment with
demos and simulations,
see the effects of changing parameters,
and every step of the way
you are asked questions
which ensure you understand the concepts.
And if you ever get stuck,
there's always a helpful
hint close at hand
and full explanations if you want them.
