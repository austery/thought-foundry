this
 video
 is
 part
 of
 what
 is


potentially
 the
 largest
 collaboration


ever
 on
 YouTube
 along
 with
 my
 friends


mr.
 beast
 and
 mark
 Rober
 Destin
 from


smarter
 every
 day
 and
 many
 many
 others


we're
 trying
 to
 get
 20
 million
 trees


planted
 before
 the
 end
 of
 this
 year
 and


each
 tree
 costs
 $1
 so
 essentially
 we're


trying
 to
 raise
 20
 million
 dollars
 if


you
 want
 to
 help
 us
 get
 to
 that
 target


well
 then
 go
 to
 team
 trees
 org
 and


donate
 now
 most
 of
 the
 youtubers
 are


making
 original
 videos
 for
 this


collaboration
 but
 since
 I'm
 obviously


currently
 travelling
 in
 Sydney
 I
 don't


have
 time
 for
 that
 so
 I
 am
 reposting
 one


of
 my
 favorite
 videos
 of
 all
 time
 which


is
 about
 trees
 and
 how
 they
 bend
 the


laws
 of
 physics
 and
 do
 things
 that


engineers
 and
 scientists
 can't
 yet


replicate
 so
 if
 you
 haven't
 seen
 that


please
 check
 it
 out
 sometimes
 the


simplest
 questions
 have
 the
 most
 amazing


answers
 like
 how
 can
 trees
 be
 so
 tall


it's
 a
 question
 that
 doesn't
 even
 seem


like
 it
 needs
 an
 answer
 trees
 just
 are


tall
 some
 of
 them
 are
 over
 a
 hundred


meters
 Why
 should
 there
 be
 a
 height


limit
 I'll
 tell
 you
 why
 trees
 need
 to


transport
 water
 from
 their
 roots
 up


until
 their
 topmost
 branches
 in
 order
 to


survive
 and
 that
 is
 no
 trivial
 task


there
 is
 a
 limit
 to
 the
 height
 that


water
 can
 be
 sucked
 up
 a
 tube
 it's
 ten


meters
 if
 you
 suck
 on
 a
 long
 vertical


straw
 the
 water
 will
 go
 no
 higher
 than


10
 meters
 at
 this
 point
 there
 will
 be
 a


perfect
 vacuum
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 straw


and
 the
 water
 will
 start
 to
 boil


spontaneously
 for
 a
 tree
 to
 raise
 water


a
 hundred
 meters
 it
 would
 have
 to
 create


a
 pressure
 difference
 of
 ten
 atmospheres


how
 would
 trees
 do
 that
 when
 I
 posed


this
 conundrum
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 said
 the


answer
 is
 transpiration
 and
 that's
 when


water
 evaporates
 from
 the
 leaf
 pulling


up
 the
 water
 molecules
 behind
 it
 and


that's
 clearly
 a
 mechanism
 a
 tree
 can


use
 to
 create
 suction
 but
 it
 doesn't


help
 us
 overcome
 this
 10
 meter
 limit


below
 as
 the
 pressure
 can
 go
 as
 if
 your


vacuum
 which
 I
 imagine
 is
 not
 happening


instead
 of
 tree
 leaves
 right
 right
 Hank


so
 you
 might
 suspect
 that
 a
 tree
 does


not
 contain
 continuous
 straw
 like
 tubes


the
 tree
 effectively
 has
 vowels
 in
 it
 so


you
 don't
 have
 a
 column
 of
 water
 this


big
 -
 what
 you're
 saying
 needs
 to
 be


filled
 with
 water
 there's
 actually
 made


up
 of
 cells
 although
 these
 are
 good


speculations
 they
 don't


to
 be
 correct
 scientists
 who
 study
 trees


find
 that
 the
 xylem
 tubes
 that
 transport


water
 do
 contain
 a
 continuous
 water


column
 so
 how
 else
 could
 the
 tree


transport
 water
 from
 the
 roots
 to
 the


leaves
 they
 don't
 suck
 they
 don't
 use
 a


vacuum
 okay


so
 how
 do
 they
 do
 it
 wheezing
 like
 a
 cow


like
 you're
 squeezing
 the
 cow
 water
 all


the
 way
 up
 there's
 little
 three
 mussels


in
 there
 yeah
 besides
 being
 a
 giant


waste
 of
 energy
 all
 of
 the
 cells
 that


make
 up
 the
 xylem
 tubes
 are
 dead
 what


about
 osmotic
 pressure
 if
 there
 is
 more


solute
 in
 the
 roots
 than
 in
 the


surrounding
 soil
 water
 would
 be
 pushed


up
 the
 tree
 but
 some
 trees
 live
 in


mangroves
 where
 the
 water
 is
 so
 salty


that
 osmotic
 pressure
 actually
 acts
 in


the
 other
 direction


so
 the
 tree
 needs
 additional
 pressure
 to


suck
 water
 into
 the
 tree
 then
 it
 must
 be


capillary
 action


the
 thinner
 the
 tube
 the
 higher
 the


water
 can
 climb
 but
 the
 tubes
 in
 a
 tree


are
 too
 wide
 at
 20
 to
 200
 micro
 meters


in
 diameter
 water
 should
 rise
 less
 than


a
 meter
 so
 how
 do
 trees
 do
 it
 well
 one


of
 the
 assumptions
 we
 made
 is
 wrong


below
 if
 the
 pressure
 can
 go
 is
 the
 pure


vacuum
 your
 vacuum
 you're
 back
 in
 a
 gas


this
 is
 true
 when
 you
 eliminate
 all
 of


the
 gas
 molecules
 the
 pressure
 is
 zero


and
 you
 have
 a
 perfect
 vacuum
 but
 in
 a


liquid
 you
 can
 go
 lower
 than
 zero


pressure
 and
 actually
 get
 negative


pressures
 in
 a
 solid
 we
 would
 think
 of


this
 as
 tension
 this
 means
 that
 the


molecules
 are
 pulling
 on
 each
 other
 and


their
 surroundings
 as
 the
 water


evaporates
 from
 the
 pores
 of
 the
 cell


wall
 they
 create
 immense
 negative


pressures
 of
 minus
 15
 atmospheres
 in
 an


average
 tree
 think
 about
 the
 air
 water


interface
 at
 the
 pore
 there
 is
 one


atmosphere
 of
 pressure
 pushing
 in
 and


negative
 15
 atmospheres
 of
 suction
 on


the
 other
 side
 so
 why
 doesn't
 the


meniscus
 break
 because
 the
 pores
 are


tiny
 only
 two
 to
 five
 nanometers
 in


diameter
 at
 this
 scale
 waters
 high


surface
 tension
 ensures
 the
 air
 water


boundary
 can
 withstand
 huge
 pressures


without
 caving
 as
 you
 move
 down
 the
 tree


the
 pressure
 increases
 up
 to
 atmospheric


at
 the
 roots
 so
 you
 can
 have
 a
 large


pressure
 difference
 between
 the
 top
 and


the
 bottom
 of
 the
 tree
 because
 the


pressure
 at
 the
 top
 is
 so
 negative
 but


hang
 on
 if
 the
 pressure
 at
 the
 top
 is


negative
 15
 atmospheres
 shouldn't
 the


water
 be
 boiling
 yes


yes
 it
 should
 but
 changing
 phase
 from


liquid
 to
 gas
 requires
 activation
 energy


and
 that
 can
 come
 in
 the
 form
 of
 a


nucleation
 site
 like
 a
 tiny
 air
 bubble


that's
 why
 it's
 so
 important
 that
 the


xylem
 tubes
 contain
 no
 air
 bubbles
 and


they
 can
 do
 this
 because
 unlike
 a
 straw


they've
 been
 water
 filled
 from
 the
 start


this
 way
 water
 remains
 in
 the
 metastable


liquid
 state
 when
 it
 really
 should
 be


boiling
 it's
 just
 like
 supercooled
 water


remains
 liquid
 even
 though
 it
 should
 be


ice
 so
 you
 could
 say
 that
 the
 water
 in
 a


tree
 is
 super
 sucked
 because
 it
 remains


liquid
 at
 such
 negative
 pressures
 and


why
 are
 trees
 moving
 all
 this
 water
 up


the
 tree
 I
 want
 you
 to
 make
 a
 guess
 say


it
 out
 loud
 for
 photosynthesis
 actually


no
 less
 than
 1%
 of
 the
 water
 is
 used
 in


photosynthetic
 reactions
 any
 other
 ideas


okay
 what
 about
 growth
 well
 five
 percent


of
 the
 water
 is
 used
 to
 make
 new
 cells


so
 what
 happens
 to
 the
 other
 95
 percent


of
 the
 water
 it
 just
 evaporates
 for
 each


molecule
 of
 carbon
 dioxide
 that
 tree


takes
 in
 it
 loses
 hundreds
 of
 molecules


of
 water


whoa
 can
 you
 believe
 how
 amazing
 this
 is


trees
 create
 huge
 negative
 pressures
 of


tens
 of
 atmospheres
 by
 evaporating
 water


through
 nanoscale
 pores
 sucking
 water
 up


a
 hundred
 meters
 in
 a
 state
 where
 it


should
 be
 boiling
 but
 can't
 because
 the


perfect
 xylem
 tubes
 contain
 no
 air


bubbles
 just
 so
 that
 most
 of
 it
 can


evaporate
 in
 the
 process
 of
 absorbing
 a


couple
 molecules
 of
 carbon
 dioxide
 I


will
 never
 look
 at
 trees
 the
 same
 way


again


[Applause]


trees
 are
 some
 of
 the
 biggest
 organisms


on
 the
 planet
 but
 where
 do
 they
 get
 that


matter
 to
 grow
 which
 nutrients
 a
 it
 the


grain
 status
 or
 any
 yeah
 goodness
 said


of
 the
 soil
 I
 suppose
 comes
 out
 of
 this


soil
 yeah


goodness
 goodness
 why
 isn't
 there
 a
 big


hole
 around
 the
 tree
 where
 it's
 taken


out
 all
 the
 soil
 does
 it's
 a
 gradually


let
 the
 soil
 has
 time
 to
 recover
 now
 I


think
 it's
 intuitive
 to
 believe
 that
 the


tree
 gets
 most
 of
 its
 mass
 from
 the
 soil


because
 you
 can
 see
 those
 roots
 digging


into
 the
 soil
 and
 they
 must
 be
 taking


something
 out
 of
 there
 and
 I
 mean
 a
 tree


looks
 like
 dirt
 and
 it
 feels
 solid
 like


dirt
 but
 it's
 not
 in
 the
 early
 1600s
 a


scientist
 named
 Johann
 Baptiste
 event


Helmholtz
 tried
 to
 figure
 out
 where
 the


mass
 of
 a
 tree
 was
 coming
 from
 so
 he
 got


a
 pot
 of
 soil
 and
 very
 carefully


measured
 the
 amount
 of
 soil
 in
 there


then
 he
 planted
 the
 tree
 and
 took
 care


of
 it
 for
 five
 years
 making
 sure
 that
 no


soil
 left
 or
 was
 added
 to
 his
 pot
 and
 at


the
 end
 of
 this
 experiment
 he
 laid
 the


tree
 to
 find
 that
 it
 was
 72
 kilograms


but
 the
 mass
 of
 soil
 had
 only
 decreased


by
 about
 60
 grams
 this
 was
 pretty
 strong


evidence
 that
 the
 mass
 of
 the
 tree
 does


not
 come
 from
 the
 soil
 I've
 never


thought
 about
 that
 actually
 because
 they


don't
 really
 eat
 anything


don't
 eat
 me
 no
 no
 they
 don't
 eat


anything
 water
 it's
 always
 absorb
 that's


all
 they
 eat
 yeah
 they
 don't
 eat


anything
 else
 no
 that's
 all
 they
 eat


well
 presumably
 from
 the
 water
 and
 the


nutrients
 from
 the
 soil
 is
 there


anything
 else
 that
 you
 need
 besides
 the


soil
 and
 the
 water
 this
 will
 be
 late


isn't
 it
 to
 make
 other
 than
 the
 original


seed
 for
 that
 particular
 trail
 the
 seed


and
 the
 soil
 and
 the
 water
 and
 that


makes
 this
 big
 tree
 of
 course


Johann
 Baptista
 van
 Helmholtz
 did


conclude
 that
 the
 tree
 was
 made
 entirely


of
 water
 now
 while
 that's
 not
 correct
 at


least
 he
 was
 on
 the
 right
 track


realizing
 that
 the
 matter
 of
 a
 tree


doesn't
 come
 out
 of
 the
 soil
 the
 Sun


energy
 yeah


the
 Sun
 energy
 are
 they
 converting


energy
 into
 maths
 or
 do
 you
 know
 what
 I


mean
 yeah
 like
 that
 there
 wasn't
 there


wasn't
 stuff
 and
 then
 there
 was
 like


where
 did
 that
 stuff
 come
 from
 my


question
 is
 where
 do
 they
 get
 that
 mass


to
 grow
 big
 it
 from
 the
 rain
 and
 the
 Sun


presumably
 like
 a
 sunlight
 and
 the


sunshine
 the
 sunshine
 does
 it
 does
 the


sunshine
 add
 mass
 to
 the
 trip
 well
 it


yes
 it
 wouldn't
 they
 wouldn't
 grow


without
 it
 I
 don't
 know
 they'd
 adds
 mass


but
 they
 wouldn't
 grow
 without
 it
 of


course
 the
 sun's
 energy
 is
 needed
 for


the
 tree
 to
 build
 the
 matter
 into
 its


branches
 and
 leaves
 but
 the
 Sun
 itself


the
 energy
 is
 not
 matter


oxi
 didn't
 the
 trees
 need
 the
 arcs
 are


indeed
 the
 earth
 and
 I
 guess
 oxygen
 the


oxygen
 of
 course
 the
 oxygen
 are
 there


any
 ingredients
 that
 we're
 missing
 come


dog
 so
 it's
 carbon
 dioxide
 carbon


dioxide
 so
 would
 it
 surprise
 you
 to
 find


out
 that
 95
 percent
 of
 a
 tree
 is


actually
 coming
 from
 carbon
 dioxide


trees
 and
 largely
 made
 up
 of
 air
 so
 as


it
 turns
 out
 trees
 are
 mostly
 made
 out


of
 air
 out
 of
 the
 carbon
 dioxide
 that


they
 take
 in
 and
 what's
 interesting
 is


that
 we
 breathe
 out
 carbon
 dioxide
 and


water
 that's
 how
 we
 lose
 mass
 but
 it's


the
 exact
 same
 substances
 that
 trees


breathe
 in
 to
 gain
 mass
 so
 if
 you
 can


imagine
 a
 closed
 system
 where
 it
 was


just
 you
 and
 a
 tree
 you
 would
 breathe


out
 that
 carbon
 dioxide
 and
 water
 the


tree
 would
 take
 it
 in
 so
 you
 would
 get


smaller
 while
 the
 tree
 is
 getting
 bigger


and
 in
 a
 sense
 you're
 becoming
 the
 tree
