In
 the
 US,
 many
 employers
 can
 fire


people
 for
 almost
 any
 reason.
 That's
 not


the
 case
 in
 Canada.
 But
 that
 doesn't


mean
 you
 can't
 face
 consequences
 for


what
 you
 say
 in
 the
 office
 or
 on
 the


internet.
 Charlie
 Herrera
 Vacuor,
 an


employment
 law
 and
 HR
 senior
 consultant


at
 Peninsula
 Canada
 explains.


[Music]


Charlie,
 welcome
 to
 the
 program.
 Uh


let's
 talk
 political
 speech
 in
 the


workplace.
 How
 is
 it
 protected
 compared


to
 race,
 gender,
 religion?


>> That's
 a
 great
 question
 and
 something


that
 we
 constantly
 clarify
 to
 our


clients
 at
 Peninsula.
 Uh
 political


speech
 is
 not
 specifically
 protected
 in


all
 Canadian
 jurisdictions.
 For


instance,
 the
 federal
 human
 rights


legislation
 and
 Ontario's
 do
 not
 protect


specifically
 political
 speech.
 However,


many
 other
 provinces
 do.
 Now,
 what
 does


this
 mean?
 Uh
 can
 I
 specifically
 and


blatantly
 ban
 political
 speech
 from
 the


workplace?
 No.


>> Uh
 what
 as
 an
 employer
 you
 can
 do
 is
 set


specific
 guidelines
 of
 what
 is


respectful
 political
 speech
 in
 the


workplace
 and
 which
 instances
 will
 be


considered
 possibly
 uh
 you
 know


something
 that
 is
 not
 respectful.
 I


think
 what
 we
 see
 of
 late
 is
 a
 lot
 of


people
 uh
 seeing
 the
 consequences
 of


something
 that
 they
 have
 said
 and
 what


we
 see
 is
 them
 being
 terminated
 from


their
 job
 or
 fired.
 On
 what
 grounds


could
 an
 employer
 terminate
 someone
 for


political
 speech?


>> So
 at
 at
 Peninsula
 what
 we
 say
 to
 uh
 our


clients
 is
 that
 no
 termination
 is


risk-free
 and
 therefore
 uh
 these
 kind
 of


decisions
 should
 be
 well
 thought.
 Um
 as


I
 mentioned
 political
 speech
 is


protected
 and
 in
 some
 jurisdictions
 as
 a


human
 rights
 uh
 protected
 characteristic


and
 therefore
 depending
 on
 the


circumstances


uh
 a
 termination
 could
 lead
 to
 a


discrimination
 claim.
 Therefore
 it
 is


important
 that
 uh
 we
 always
 establish


specific
 guidelines
 of
 what
 is
 accepted


political
 speech,
 what
 is
 respectful
 to


other
 employees
 in
 how
 to
 have
 these


kind
 of
 you
 know
 conversations.
 so
 that


everyone
 operates
 uh
 with
 uh
 knowledge


and
 understanding
 of
 what
 is
 the
 um


expected
 conduct.


>> Termination
 if
 we
 look
 at
 a
 spectrum
 is


on
 one
 end.
 There
 are
 other
 things
 that


could
 be
 done
 other
 actions
 that


employers
 can
 do.
 What
 what
 else
 could


they
 be
 looking
 at


>> at
 at
 the
 get-go?
 What
 we
 advise
 our


clients
 is
 to
 have
 specific
 policies
 in


place.
 These
 specific
 policies
 will


usually
 determine
 what
 is
 the
 expected


conduct
 and
 under
 which
 circumstances


could
 discipline
 uh
 follow.
 Of
 course
 uh


as
 legislation
 and
 case
 law
 um
 you
 know


usually
 uh
 tells
 employers
 uh
 how
 to


operate
 is
 to
 always
 follow
 what
 is


called
 a
 progressive
 discipline


approach.


>> So
 of
 course
 termination
 never
 being
 the


first
 instance
 unless
 circumstances


merit.
 So,
 um,
 usually
 you
 want
 to


follow
 first
 a
 verbal
 warning,
 then
 a


written
 warning,
 a
 final
 or
 second


written
 warning,
 and
 then
 possibly
 a


termination.


>> Okay.
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 um
 sort
 of,


you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 work
 from


home,
 but
 also
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 the


influence
 of
 technology.
 You
 know,
 a
 lot


of
 people
 after
 if
 they're
 working
 a
 9


to5
 after
 5:00,
 they're
 they're
 living


their
 lives.
 And
 I
 I
 want
 to
 make
 a


distinction
 or
 is
 there
 a
 distinction


between
 um
 someone
 who
 is
 you
 know
 using


social
 media
 talking
 about
 something


that
 could
 be
 controversial
 uh
 at
 home


online
 versus
 in
 the
 office.
 Yeah,


that's
 that's
 a
 great
 question
 and
 you


know
 something
 that
 has
 come
 up
 a
 lot


lately
 given
 uh
 everything
 that
 has


happened
 around
 certain
 political


figures
 expressions
 and
 and
 you
 know
 um


so
 there's
 two
 approaches.
 The
 first


approach
 is
 um
 having
 as
 I
 mentioned


before
 a
 workplace
 policy
 that
 uh
 tells


employees
 what
 is
 the
 best
 practice


conduct
 for
 their
 workplace.
 The
 second


one
 is
 uh
 always
 to
 have
 a
 transparent


and
 constant
 communication
 with
 your


employees
 about
 what
 what
 how
 to
 go
 over


specific
 situations.


>> So
 in
 this
 year
 it's
 been
 it's
 been
 a


hard
 year
 for
 Canadians
 because
 we
 had


plenty
 of
 elections.
 We
 are
 coming
 out


or
 we're
 going
 through
 you
 know
 um


turmoil
 of
 a
 relationship
 with
 our


closest
 neighbor.
 Uh
 and
 you
 know
 folks


have
 the
 you
 know
 in
 they
 want
 to
 say


something


>> have
 a
 lot
 to
 say.


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 Um
 I
 mean
 we're
 people


we're
 you
 know
 uh
 and
 and
 so
 in
 that


regard
 um
 it's
 always
 important
 to
 for


employers
 to
 say
 before
 you
 want
 to
 say


something
 make
 sure
 if
 if
 you
 really


have
 to
 if
 you
 really
 have
 to
 and
 if
 you


really
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 there
 are


certain
 caveats
 or
 there
 are
 certain


protections
 that
 are
 in
 place.
 Is
 your


social
 media
 does
 your
 social
 media
 have


uh
 your
 company
 affiliation?


>> Is
 your
 like
 a
 specific
 name
 there?


>> You
 know,
 those
 things.
 And
 and
 then
 of


course,


let's
 try
 to
 moderate
 the
 way
 that
 we


express
 ourselves.
 you
 know
 um
 hateful


uh
 speech
 you
 know
 can
 always
 bring


problems
 not
 only
 for
 oneself
 but
 also


if
 you
 know
 if
 you
 are
 having
 your


company
 affiliation
 attached
 to
 that
 uh


it
 could
 bring
 reputational
 problems
 for


the
 company
 and
 that
 is
 where
 a
 a


workplace
 policy
 best
 addresses
 that


those
 kind
 of
 instances.


>> All
 right
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 uh
 about
 some


real
 uh
 life
 examples.
 Uh
 we
 asked
 the


market
 research
 firm
 Advanced
 Symbolics


Inc.
 uh
 which
 uses
 artificial


intelligence
 technology
 known
 as
 Poly
 to


find
 out
 what
 topics
 uh
 people
 are


afraid
 to
 talk
 about
 in
 the
 workplace.


And
 the
 number
 one
 topic
 came
 up
 as


Charlie
 Kirk,
 not
 Charlie
 U,
 but
 Charlie


Kirk,
 which
 for
 people
 who
 don't
 know,
 a


uh
 right-wing
 um
 commentator
 who
 was


killed
 in
 Utah
 uh
 on
 campus
 uh
 last


month.
 And
 what
 they
 found
 was
 that
 any


conversation
 around
 Charlie
 Kirk
 quickly


escalated
 into
 heated
 arguments
 or


accusations
 and
 there
 was
 a
 palpable


sense
 that
 any
 comment
 could
 be


misrepresented
 or
 weaponized
 by


colleagues
 with
 opposing
 views.
 With


this
 specific
 example,
 do
 people
 need
 to


be
 afraid
 of
 what
 they
 say
 about
 him?


>> You
 know
 that
 statement
 in
 itself
 is
 is


very
 dangerous.
 Uh
 when
 people
 live
 with


fear
 about
 uh
 what
 their
 thoughts
 are


and
 their
 expressions,


it
 seems
 like


there
 are
 many
 things
 that
 have
 gone


wrong
 before.
 Now
 we're
 trying
 to
 figure


out
 how
 to
 address
 them.
 Um
 what
 I've


said
 before
 um
 in
 in
 part
 of
 the


publications
 that
 we
 do
 is
 that
 uh
 both


employees
 and
 employers


uh
 have
 are
 going
 through
 a
 lot
 of


changes
 and
 the
 velocity
 of
 these


changes
 is
 like
 unprecedented
 pace.


Legislation
 is
 being
 coming
 up.
 New


things
 are
 happening.
 Uh
 you
 know


there's
 tension
 growing
 and
 then
 people


just
 react.


And
 in
 this
 reaction
 is
 where
 you
 know


the
 problems
 the
 tension
 comes
 and
 the


fear
 ensues
 both
 for
 the
 employee
 and


the
 employer.


>> Uh
 in
 these
 situations


uh
 I
 acknowledge
 that
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of


you
 know
 um
 tension
 and
 um
 just


uncertainty
 about
 how
 to
 manage
 these


situations.
 Um
 but
 I
 think
 the
 key
 one


is
 empathy.


how
 how
 is
 my
 expression
 going
 to
 be


received
 by
 the
 other
 person
 and
 if


another
 person
 were
 to
 say
 something


that
 I
 completely
 disagree
 with,
 how


should
 I
 how
 will
 I
 receive
 that?
 Um,


and
 I
 think
 that
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 key


messages
 that
 all
 employers
 should
 be


putting
 out
 there
 is,
 you
 know,
 have


more
 empathy
 in
 the
 way
 that
 you
 express


yourself
 because
 however
 you
 may
 be


hurting
 other
 people,
 you
 may
 also
 be


subject
 to
 that.
 And
 when
 when
 if
 we


don't
 do
 that
 the
 problem
 is
 that


situations
 will
 escalate
 and
 you
 know


may
 that
 never
 happen
 that
 you
 know
 we


have
 violence
 in
 the
 workplace.


>> One
 of
 the
 key
 things
 that
 we
 tell
 all


our
 employers
 our
 our
 clients
 is
 that
 um


they
 have
 an
 obligation
 to
 have
 a


respectful
 work
 environment.
 That
 is
 an


actual
 legal
 obligation.
 And
 so
 if


employers
 cannot
 guarantee
 that
 you
 know


employees
 can
 have
 uh
 a
 good
 resource
 to


go
 against
 their
 businesses.
 So
 this


also
 clarifies
 why
 employers
 are
 also


feel
 very
 tense.


>> Can
 you
 give
 us
 a
 sense
 of
 what
 in
 this


moment
 you
 describe
 the
 sort
 of
 the


climate
 that
 we
 are
 in.
 Um
 what
 are
 you


hearing
 and
 seeing
 from
 employers
 and


employees
 about
 sort
 of
 those


conversations
 right
 now?
 are
 is
 it


turning?
 You
 know,
 I
 sometimes
 it
 feels


like
 on
 social
 media
 what
 we
 see
 is
 sort


of a
 witch
 hunt
 sometimes
 when
 someone


says
 something
 um
 that
 may
 be
 deemed
 you


know
 on
 one
 side
 of
 of
 the
 spectrum
 on


the
 political
 speech
 spectrum
 um
 as


controversial.
 It
 turns
 into
 a
 witch


hunt
 to
 find
 their
 employer
 as
 a
 way
 to


uh
 show
 them
 that
 they
 can't
 say
 that.


Um
 I
 am
 curious
 have
 you
 dealt
 with


employers
 and
 employees
 who
 are
 having


to
 navigate
 you
 know
 okay
 yes
 this
 was


said
 but
 legally
 what
 are
 the


ramifications


>> so
 great
 question
 uh
 yes
 indeed
 many
 of


our
 clients
 have
 reached
 out
 about
 this


specific
 issue
 uh
 what
 we
 first
 see
 is


that
 employers
 are
 definitely
 tense
 they


are
 fearful
 because
 they
 see
 that
 their


employees
 many
 of
 them
 have
 their


affiliation
 in
 their
 social
 media


>> so
 they
 are
 they
 are
 fearful
 they


they're
 fearful
 that
 they're
 also
 their


companies
 are
 going
 to
 be
 subject
 to
 the


witch
 hunt.
 So
 there
 is
 a
 whole
 um


context
 that
 just
 doesn't
 allow
 for


there
 to
 be
 a
 moment
 of
 um
 you
 know
 u


cooling
 off
 period.
 Everybody's


reacting.
 Uh
 what
 we
 do
 tell
 our


employers
 and
 we
 prepare
 them
 for


success
 is
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 have
 your


policies
 in
 place
 that
 you
 have


communicated
 and
 been
 transparent
 with


your
 employees
 about
 how
 to
 handle
 these


situations
 and
 that
 you
 know
 when
 we


know
 for
 instance
 when
 we
 know
 that


there
 is
 a
 conflict
 in
 the
 Middle
 East


and
 that
 people
 will
 talk
 about
 this.
 We


tell
 them,
 we
 preempt
 this
 by
 saying,


"Please
 refrain
 from
 using
 hateful


words.
 Refrain
 from
 using
 hateful


expressions
 or
 expressions
 that
 you


wouldn't
 like
 to
 be
 told
 to
 yourself."


These
 kind
 of
 communications
 and


transparency
 are
 the
 best
 way
 to
 just


try
 to
 find
 a
 path
 forward.
 It's
 not


going
 to
 be
 the
 end
 solution.
 Things


will
 have
 to
 be
 tweaked.
 This
 is
 not


something
 that,
 you
 know,
 uh,
 it's
 said


once
 and
 never
 touched
 again.
 Can
 I
 get


some
 clarification
 as
 to
 what
 what
 would


be
 deemed
 a
 hateful
 comment?


>> Um,
 well,
 like
 as
 as
 you
 mentioned
 that


with
 the
 assassination
 of
 Charlie
 Kirk,


you
 know,
 I
 think
 that
 comments
 that
 try


to
 contextualize
 something
 that
 our


criminal
 code
 says
 that
 it's
 wrong
 to
 do


>> is
 definitely
 something
 that
 um


will
 create
 some
 hostility
 or
 may
 create


some
 hostility
 whether
 he
 deserved
 to


die
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 Mhm.


>> Okay.


>> So
 those
 kind
 of
 things
 I
 would
 say
 it's


better
 better
 to
 you
 know
 have
 them


somewhere
 else
 uh
 in
 a
 dinner


conversation


um
 at
 a
 pub
 or
 or
 or
 other
 in
 a
 context


that
 is
 not
 in
 a
 place
 where


you
 are
 going
 to
 have
 repeated


iterations
 with
 the
 people
 that
 you
 have


to
 work
 with.
 Hm.
 I
 want
 to
 get
 a
 better


understanding
 from
 the
 employee
 uh
 side


of
 things.
 We
 talk
 about
 sort
 of
 the


witch
 hunt.
 We
 talk
 about
 the
 pressure


that
 employers,
 you
 know,
 have
 to
 put


out
 a
 statement.
 Um
 if
 an
 employee
 is


fired
 for
 posting
 something
 offensive


about
 Charlie
 Kirk
 or
 uh
 Israel
 and


Palestine,
 what
 recourse
 does
 the


employee
 have
 to
 challenge
 their


termination?
 Sometimes
 it
 it
 may
 seem


that
 employers
 are
 um
 being
 quick


because
 they
 have
 to
 respond
 in
 a
 in
 a


we're
 in
 a
 time
 and
 age
 where
 if
 you


don't
 see
 a
 response
 where
 someone
 has


been
 fired
 from
 their
 job,
 then


something
 is
 not
 being
 done.
 But
 on
 the


employee
 side,
 is
 there
 something
 that


they
 can
 do?


>> We're
 very
 careful
 at
 Peninsula
 to


always
 tell
 our
 employers,
 your
 employee


has
 rights,
 your
 employee
 has
 guarantees


that
 you
 need
 to
 respect.
 Uh
 freedom
 of


speech
 is
 specifically
 one
 of
 them.
 And


in
 certain
 jurisdictions,
 as
 I
 mentioned


before,
 political
 speech
 is
 specifically


protected.
 So
 that
 means
 that
 operating


through
 termination
 or
 um
 unreasonable


disciplinary
 action
 can
 warrant
 you
 a


human
 rights
 claim.
 Uh
 what
 we
 do
 tell


our
 employ
 uh
 um
 our
 clients
 to


communicate
 with
 their
 employees
 is
 um


how
 to
 manage
 this
 in
 a
 situation
 that


allows
 them
 to
 have
 the
 freedom
 but
 also


makes
 them
 aware
 that
 their
 speech
 and


the
 way
 that
 they
 uh
 voice
 it
 uh
 can
 be


put
 under
 scrutiny.


>> It's
 very
 clear
 that
 there
 are
 blurred


lines.
 Yes.
 uh
 this
 is
 we're
 talking


this
 is
 a
 in
 sometimes
 it's
 very
 clear


as
 to
 what
 is
 political
 speech
 and
 and


what
 could
 be
 considered
 hateful
 but
 to


what
 extent
 is
 speech
 in
 the
 eye
 of
 the


beholder
 I
 want
 to
 give
 you
 an
 example


you
 know
 the
 phrase
 from
 the
 river
 to


the
 sea
 Palestine
 will
 be
 free


>> might
 be
 offensive
 to
 some
 people
 but


not
 to
 others
 how
 do
 employers
 navigate


the
 nuance
 of
 that


>> so
 everybody
 is
 entitled
 to
 uh
 a


specific
 view
 on
 a
 specific
 tension,


right?
 Um,


and
 when
 we're
 talking
 about
 war


that
 uh
 will
 always
 have
 gray
 areas,


the
 specific
 way
 is
 uh
 to
 ensure
 that


the
 workplace
 as
 a
 whole
 is
 able
 to
 move


forward
 no matter
 how
 it's
 being
 said,


no matter
 what
 is
 being
 said.
 because


what
 can
 be
 offensive
 to
 somebody
 may


not
 be
 offensive
 to
 others
 and
 vice


versa.
 So
 the
 issue
 here
 uh
 is
 how
 can


we
 move
 together
 in
 a
 way
 that
 you
 know


people
 don't
 separate
 people
 don't


create
 violence
 people
 don't
 create
 uh


tension
 um
 I
 always
 say
 that
 uh
 with
 the


most
 clear-cut
 ways
 uh
 when
 we're


talking
 about
 the
 LGBTQ
 plus
 community


>> something
 like
 a
 pronoun
 means


everything
 right


>> for
 that
 community


>> because
 it's
 talking
 about
 not
 not
 only


their
 identity
 but
 the
 way
 that
 they


express
 themselves.
 Uh,
 and
 having
 a


comment
 about
 that
 may
 be
 like
 something


in
 passing
 for
 many
 folks,
 but
 for
 that


community
 it's
 everything
 and
 not
 being


respectful
 and
 about
 that
 it's
 literally


negating
 their
 existence.
 So
 expressions


from
 the
 river
 to
 the
 sea
 may
 mean,
 you


know,
 something
 totally
 uh
 rightful
 and


champion
 for
 some,
 but
 for
 the
 other


ones
 has
 to
 do
 with
 their
 existence
 as


well.


>> Charlie,
 we're
 going
 to
 leave
 it
 there.


Really
 appreciate
 it.
 Uh
 some
 good
 food


for
 thought
 for
 employees
 and
 employers.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.
