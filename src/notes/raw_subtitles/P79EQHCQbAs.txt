[Music]


hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 wealth
 fund
 and


today
 in
 the
 podcast
 we
 have
 James
 Su


the
 CEO
 of
 trip.com
 warm
 welcome
 thank


you
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me
 now
 um
 I
 think


this
 is
 the
 first
 podcast
 you
 ever
 done


that's
 right
 that
 is
 so
 so
 much
 fun
 now


you
 built
 um
 trip.com
 into
 one
 of
 the


world
 largest
 travel
 companies
 um
 we
 are


the
 lucky
 owner
 or
 more
 than
 2%
 of
 the


company
 or
 roughly
 $700
 million


so
 you
 grew
 up
 in
 Shanghai
 studied
 in


the
 US
 so
 what
 does
 travel
 mean
 to
 you


travel
 means
 quite
 a
 lot
 to
 me
 uh
 maybe


I
 can
 start
 with
 my
 journey
 uh
 on
 travel


I
 was
 born
 in
 Shanghai
 and
 went
 to


pcking
 University
 law
 school
 and
 during


my
 second
 year
 one
 of
 the
 professors


from
 the
 USA
 wanted
 to
 come
 and
 select


one
 students
 to
 go
 to
 study
 in
 the
 USA


and
 I
 was
 very
 blessed
 for
 the


opportunity
 to
 go
 to
 study
 in
 the
 USA


what
 did
 it
 pick
 you
 think
 because
 I'm


always
 very
 curious
 uh
 and
 ask
 questions


uh
 when
 my
 professors
 was
 presenting
 so


when
 I
 arrived
 in
 the
 USA
 China
 just


opened
 the
 door
 it's
 a
 was
 only
 early


stage
 of
 the
 open
 door
 policy
 uh
 my


parents
 were
 both
 Engineers
 they
 made


decent
 living
 uh
 to
 support
 my
 brother


and
 myself
 but
 if
 you
 convert
 their
 200


R&B
 into
 USD
 is
 $20
 per
 month
 so
 so
 I


couldn't
 ask
 for
 money
 to
 support
 myself


instead
 I
 worked
 two
 jobs
 one
 in
 as
 a


librarian
 uh
 the
 other
 one
 is
 as
 a
 bus


girl
 to
 clean
 up
 dishes
 making
 $3
 per


hour
 uh
 to
 support
 myself
 but
 after
 I


paid
 my
 tuition
 I
 have
 no
 money
 for
 room


and
 boarding
 but
 my
 professor's
 family


were
 very
 kind
 to
 me
 they
 took
 me
 in
 and


treated
 me
 as
 their
 own
 child
 so
 I
 was


very
 grateful
 and
 I
 told
 them
 in
 China


the
 confusion
 teaching
 is
 that
 when
 kids


are
 young
 parents
 take
 good
 care
 of


their
 children
 but
 when
 parents
 get


older
 good
 children
 will
 always
 take


care
 of
 their
 parents
 so
 I
 told
 them


when
 I'm
 able
 to
 I
 would
 like
 to
 take


good
 care
 of
 you
 and
 they
 said
 oh
 honey


you
 don't
 need
 to
 take
 care
 of
 us
 but


instead
 if
 you
 can
 help
 the


international
 students
 in
 the
 same
 way


as
 we
 do
 for
 you
 will
 be
 very
 happy
 wow


so
 I
 what
 you've
 done
 yeah
 and
 I
 was


very
 touched
 although
 I
 was
 peniles
 at


that
 time
 but
 I
 always
 had
 a
 dream
 that


someday
 if
 I'm
 able
 to
 I
 would
 like
 to


establish
 a
 scholarship
 name
 after
 my


professor
 and
 I
 was
 very
 glad
 in
 2016
 I


went
 back
 to
 my
 university
 and


established
 a
 scholarship
 to
 name
 after


the
 professors
 who
 helped
 me
 so
 much
 and


we
 named
 our
 old
 daughter


uh
 after
 my
 professor's
 wife
 because
 she


is
 just
 like
 a
 mother
 to
 me
 and
 we


celebrated
 her
 93's
 birthday
 uh
 last


year
 moving
 on
 to
 trip.com
 how
 did
 you


end
 up
 there
 and
 how
 did
 you
 end
 up
 at


the
 top
 uh
 in
 205
 our
 board
 was
 looking


for
 a
 CFO
 uh
 and
 I
 was
 very
 blessed
 for


the
 opportunity
 to
 become
 the
 first


female
 CFO
 uh
 in
 a
 China
 Market
 when
 I


made
 the
 decision
 I
 asked
 myself
 three


questions
 first
 of
 all
 what
 do
 you
 like


to
 spend
 time
 uh
 in
 Asia
 uh
 at
 that
 time


Asia
 is
 growing
 very
 fast
 uh
 so
 I


thought
 that's
 a
 good
 market
 and
 with
 my


bilingual
 Background
 by
 culture


background
 it's
 good
 to
 be
 a
 good
 bridge


between
 Asia
 with
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world


the
 second
 question
 I
 ask
 myself
 is
 that


if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 in
 Asia
 what
 industry


do
 you
 want
 to
 be
 in
 and
 I
 think
 I


thought
 the
 travel
 industry
 really


brings
 people
 together
 and
 the
 third


question
 I
 ask
 is
 that
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be


in
 Asia
 in
 the
 travel
 industry
 which


company
 has
 the
 best
 opportunity
 to
 be


successful
 and
 after
 I
 talk
 to
 our
 board


I
 believe
 our
 team
 are
 very
 well


equipped
 uh
 to
 take
 the
 leadership
 for


the
 trouble
 industry
 why
 uh
 why
 is


trip.com
 so
 successful
 internally
 we


have
 a
 for
 formula
 which
 we
 called


55443
 three
 means
 you
 are
 at
 the
 market


level
 one
 and
 two
 means
 you're
 below
 the


market
 level
 four
 is
 above
 Market
 level


but
 the
 barrier
 of
 entries
 is
 relatively


lower
 and
 five
 is
 more
 above
 uh
 way


above
 the
 market
 uh
 so
 the
 second
 player


without
 5
 to
 10
 years
 cannot
 catch
 up


with
 you
 so
 the
 two
 elements
 we
 assign


value
 five
 is


uh
 branding
 and
 service
 and
 why
 that's


important
 because
 if
 you
 build
 a
 service


and
 branding
 just
 like
 Singapore


Airlines
 or
 four
 seasons
 people
 will


trust
 you
 and
 uh
 travel
 with
 you
 and


it's
 very
 difficult
 to
 catch
 up
 with
 you


is
 that
 your
 kind
 of
 goal
 when
 you
 think


about
 your
 brand
 and
 the
 perception
 are


those
 two
 Brands
 something
 you
 aspired


to
 be
 for
 season
 7
 sing
 Airlines
 yes
 in


travel
 industry
 these
 are
 very
 why
 and


why
 those
 two
 brands
 M
 because
 in
 when


you
 bought
 Singapore
 Airline
 their
 price


is
 not
 the
 lowest
 it's
 even
 you
 charge
 a


premium
 but
 when
 you
 when
 they
 serve
 you


there
 are
 lots
 of
 signs
 behind
 it
 yeah


for
 example
 uh
 when
 they
 ask
 you
 a


question
 St
 ask
 you
 a
 question
 the
 eye


to
 ey
 context
 is
 uh
 uh
 very
 good
 and


also
 when
 they
 put
 down
 a
 cup
 for


example
 instead
 of
 put
 it
 down
 walk
 away


they
 put
 it
 down
 they
 will
 move
 it
 the


little
 detail
 behind
 the
 scene
 make


customer
 to
 connect
 with
 your
 team
 so
 I


studied
 and
 learned
 a
 lot
 from
 these


global
 leaders
 uh
 so
 in
 trip.com
 when


you
 call
 our
 call
 center
 globally
 7
 Days


times
 24
 hours
 a
 life
 person
 will
 answer


the
 phone
 within
 30
 seconds
 in
 your


native
 language
 when
 there
 is
 an
 issue


within
 2
 minutes
 our
 team
 will
 find
 a


solution
 for
 you


when
 something
 unexpected
 delay
 happened


for
 example
 there
 is
 a
 tsunami
 in
 Japan


earthquake
 in
 the
 pool
 or
 Middle
 East


had
 a
 conflict
 within
 2
 minutes
 our
 team


will
 reach
 out
 to
 the
 customers
 on
 the


ground
 make
 sure
 they
 are
 comforted
 make


sure
 we
 transfer
 them
 to
 the
 safe
 Hotel


offer
 hot
 meal
 hot
 shower
 and
 the
 very


next
 day
 if
 our
 customers
 would
 like
 to


come
 back
 to
 their
 home
 country
 we'll


make
 priority
 around
 arrangement
 for


them
 so
 that's
 why
 customer
 trust
 us


when
 they
 travel
 with
 us
 and
 with
 that


brand
 preco
 the
 most
 expensive
 tool
 we


sold
 cost
 about
 200,000
 USD
 per
 person


per
 trip
 80
 Days
 around
 the
 world
 W
 and


guess
 how
 long
 did
 it
 take
 us
 to
 sell


these
 packages
 not
 long
 take
 a
 guess
 how


long
 uh
 5
 hours
 very
 good
 guess
 17


seconds


wow
 yeah
 the
 reason
 we
 can
 do
 that
 is


because
 of
 the
 trust
 in
 our
 brand
 so


tell
 us
 give
 us
 a
 feel
 for
 the
 the
 size


of
 the
 company


so
 how
 how
 do
 you
 measure
 size
 in
 your


business
 so
 in
 terms
 of
 gmv
 total


proceeds
 where
 about
 so
 that's
 the
 total


sales
 of
 your
 products
 correct
 correct


the
 total
 proceeds
 will
 bring
 to


Airlines
 to
 Hotel
 Partners
 rental
 C


Business
 local
 tour
 operators


attractions
 that
 total
 is
 about
 60


billion
 USD
 in
 terms
 of
 our
 Revenue
 our


commission
 is
 about
 6
 billion
 USD
 in


2023
 and
 bottom
 line
 is
 2
 billion
 Us
 and


how
 how
 exactly
 do
 you
 make
 money
 we


charge
 a
 commission
 uh
 so
 when
 we
 sell
 a


hotel
 rooms
 uh
 Hotel
 will
 pay
 us
 a


commission
 as
 a
 sales
 channel
 so
 we


talked
 about
 the
 two
 elements
 with
 value


five
 the
 other
 two
 elements
 we
 value


four
 is
 technology
 and
 products
 uh
 we


have
 about
 10,000
 Engineers
 globally
 to


invest
 heavily
 to
 innovate
 our
 product


and
 take
 care
 of
 our
 customers
 but
 once


the
 product
 is
 released
 uh
 people
 can


copy
 it
 so
 the
 barrier
 of
 enturies
 is


not
 as
 high
 as
 service
 and
 branding
 but


still
 it's
 very
 important
 the
 last


elements
 uh
 is
 uh
 pricing
 uh
 we
 value
 it


at
 three
 at
 the
 market
 level
 uh
 as
 the


largest
 player
 we
 can
 always
 is
 ask
 for


a
 very
 good
 price
 for
 our
 customers
 but


we
 never
 brand
 ourself
 as
 the
 lowest


price
 leader
 in
 the
 market
 so
 when
 you


ask
 why
 trip.com
 you
 know
 become
 a
 very


uh
 leading
 player
 in
 the
 travel
 industry


because
 of
 our
 focus
 in
 service
 and


branding
 product
 and
 technology
 and
 also


parity
 in
 pricing
 so
 when
 you
 grow
 how


what
 are
 the
 growth


factors
 um
 would
 you
 have
 I
 mean
 do
 do


you
 cover
 now
 all
 destinations
 all


Airlines
 all
 hotels
 yes
 okay
 yes
 so
 our


uh
 growth
 strategy
 is
 to
 provide
 a


One-Stop
 shopping
 platform
 so
 for


example
 when
 a
 customer
 fly
 from


Shanghai
 to
 Oso
 if
 he
 or
 she
 is
 booking


a
 business
 class
 or
 first
 class
 tickets


we'll
 recommend
 a
 five-star
 hotel
 to
 to


him
 uh
 intern
 InterContinental
 hotel
 for


example
 and
 then
 we'll
 calculate
 the


distance


between
 the
 oso
 airport
 to
 his
 hotel
 and


send
 a
 car
 to
 them
 and
 when
 the
 customer


check
 in
 we
 recommend
 a
 very
 nice


restaurants
 for
 them
 and
 after
 they


check
 in
 we
 also
 say
 oh
 by
 the
 way
 we


have
 a
 toour
 package
 for
 you
 if
 you


would
 like
 to
 uh
 travel
 on
 the
 weekend


after
 a
 business
 meeting
 so
 one
 stop


solution
 make
 the
 travel
 very
 pleasant


for
 our
 customers
 how
 uh
 does
 your


technology
 compare
 with
 competition
 you


mentioned
 that
 you
 would
 give
 four
 but


um
 what
 type
 of
 uh
 advantages
 do
 you


have
 on
 your
 technology
 side
 our


technology
 uh
 we
 invest
 heavily
 every


year
 uh
 we
 have
 about
 10,000
 Engineers


uh
 we
 use
 AI
 to
 improve
 our
 efficiency


uh
 the
 AI
 is
 used
 for
 four
 areas
 the


first
 one
 is
 the
 user
 interface
 uh
 in


the
 past
 we
 need
 to
 do
 search
 for


example
 I'm
 coming
 to
 Oso
 with
 two
 kids


I
 would
 like
 to
 have
 a
 hotel
 with
 uh
 two


beds
 with
 a
 swimming
 pool
 and
 then
 the


system
 will
 pop
 up
 with
 a
 couple
 of


selections
 right
 now
 our
 trip
 Genie
 is


very
 Advanced
 you
 can
 just
 talk
 to
 the


system
 and
 it
 will
 pop
 up
 automatically


the
 selections
 for
 our
 customers
 the


second
 usage
 of
 AI
 is
 the
 efficiency
 for


our
 engineering
 team
 using
 co-pilot


we'll
 be
 able
 to
 cut
 the
 coding
 time


anywhere
 between
 15%
 to
 30%
 that's
 a


huge
 lift
 of
 our
 uh
 technology
 team
 the


third
 one
 is
 customer
 service
 uh
 we're


able
 to
 identify
 the
 customer
 needs


within
 very
 short
 time
 and
 give
 them
 the


best
 selection
 either
 automatically
 or


if
 necessary
 uh
 with
 a
 live
 person
 and


the
 last
 one
 is
 the
 content
 generation


with
 the
 technology
 in
 video
 uh
 and


picture
 we're
 able
 to
 generate
 very
 good


uh
 content
 uh
 using
 technology
 so
 we


invest
 heavily
 to
 stay
 ahead
 how
 will
 um


this
 look
 differently
 in
 10
 years
 time


what
 is
 what
 is
 the
 future
 for
 instance


of
 customer
 service
 in
 the
 future
 uh
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 past
 10
 years
 our
 grow


trajectory
 is
 20
 to
 30%
 every
 year
 ker


but
 our
 head
 count
 in
 the
 call
 center
 is


very
 flat
 the
 reason
 we
 can
 do
 it
 is


because
 of
 our
 investment
 on
 the
 backand


to
 support
 our
 customers
 so
 in
 the


future
 I
 think
 a
 human
 intervention
 is


only
 necessary
 when
 there
 is
 unexpected


events
 happened
 hopefully
 standard


transaction
 can
 all
 be
 handled
 very


smoothly
 through
 technology
 now
 um


customer
 experience
 um
 I
 think
 it's
 so


interesting
 and
 uh
 there
 is
 this
 book


called
 unreasonable
 Hospitality
 about
 uh


you
 know
 this
 famous
 uh
 New
 York


restaurant
 um
 now
 what
 is
 the
 best


experience
 you
 ever
 had
 the
 best


experience
 I
 had
 was
 uh
 uh
 this
 past


Chinese
 New
 Year
 our
 family
 went
 to
 the


South
 Pole
 and
 we
 call
 it
 white
 desert


because
 without
 the
 support
 uh
 of
 uh
 the


aircrafts
 or
 this
 curation
 is


unreachable
 by
 human
 uh
 so
 that
 tells
 me


how
 important
 and
 excellent
 service
 is
 I


think
 the
 best
 I
 had
 was
 in
 a
 real
 KH
 in


Kyoto
 in
 Japan
 oh
 lovely
 yeah
 Japan
 is


so
 famous
 for
 the
 excellent
 Services


absolutely
 now
 how
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 that


um
 that
 this
 service
 mentality
 is
 kind


of
 going
 through
 the
 whole
 company


everybody
 uh
 how
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 it


doesn't
 slip
 our
 young
 employee
 when


they
 come
 to
 our
 office
 uh
 they
 most
 of


them
 are
 single
 child
 because
 China
 had


this
 one
 child
 policy
 for
 a
 long
 time


they
 were
 the
 center
 of
 attention
 in


their
 family
 but
 when
 they
 come
 to
 our


office
 we
 train
 them
 to
 treat
 our


customer
 as
 their
 family
 so
 the
 slogan


is
 let
 our
 customer
 hear
 your
 smile
 uh


so
 they
 are
 trained
 to
 take
 very
 good


care
 of
 our
 customers
 do
 you
 think
 it's


more
 difficult
 to
 get
 young
 people
 now


to
 have
 that
 attitude
 different
 years


have
 different
 challenges
 when
 we
 first


established
 the
 company
 uh
 young
 people


who
 are
 from
 the
 remote
 here
 come
 here


they
 want
 to
 money
 make
 money
 and
 send


it
 to
 their
 family
 so
 if
 you
 give
 them


enough
 uh
 bonuses
 young
 people
 are
 very


very
 willing
 uh
 to
 work
 overtime
 work
 on


the
 weekend
 or
 work
 on
 the
 evening
 shift


now
 with
 the
 living
 standard
 is


improving
 money
 is
 not
 the
 incentive


they're
 looking
 for
 instead
 the
 career


pass
 is
 something
 we
 can
 really
 uh
 give


our
 young
 employees
 to
 grow
 so
 our
 young


employees
 uh
 when
 they
 start
 with
 us
 if


they
 work
 well
 some
 of
 them
 become
 Buc


leading
 a
 big
 operation
 in
 our
 company


so
 I
 always
 feel
 very
 proud
 of
 their


achievements
 within
 our
 company
 how


would
 you
 characterize
 your
 leadership


style
 I'm
 a
 a
 very
 few
 female
 leaders
 in


the
 high-tech
 industry
 and
 I
 think
 women


have
 lots
 of
 good
 traits
 which
 we
 can


bring
 to
 our
 team
 for
 example
 uh
 we
 are


very
 willing
 to
 make
 personal
 sacrifice


for
 the
 best
 interest
 of
 our
 company
 uh


we're
 very
 willing
 to
 put
 ourself
 in


other
 people's
 shoes
 so
 when
 we


negotiate
 a
 deal
 we
 very
 quick
 can
 reach


a
 win-win
 uh
 agreement
 we're
 very
 good


with
 communication
 and
 team
 building
 so


I
 really
 want
 to
 uh
 make
 sure
 we
 pave


the
 way
 for
 our
 future
 uh
 female
 leaders


so
 that
 they
 can
 take
 on
 more


responsibility
 now
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


things
 to
 drill
 down
 on
 here
 but
 um


let's
 start
 with
 the
 negotiations
 you


think
 women
 are
 better
 at
 reaching


win-win
 how
 come
 I
 think
 a
 a
 lot
 of
 time


uh
 instead
 of
 fighting
 my
 way
 or
 your


way
 with
 the
 big
 eagle
 uh
 during
 the


negotiation
 team
 when
 I
 went
 to
 a


negotiation
 conference
 room
 normally
 I


just
 bring
 our
 legal
 council
 and
 our


finance
 team
 three
 of
 us
 happens
 to
 be


uh
 ladies
 uh
 the
 other
 side
 are
 full
 of


uh
 male
 negotiators
 with
 suits
 very


serious
 so
 the
 way
 we
 break
 the
 deal
 is


to
 really
 understand
 what
 they're


looking
 for
 what
 is
 the
 ve
 very


important
 interest
 from
 the
 other
 side


and
 how
 we
 can
 meet
 in
 the
 middle
 so


normally
 the
 negotiation
 for
 for
 us
 is


to
 find
 a
 common
 interest
 are
 we
 going


to
 achieve
 1+
 1
 equals
 to
 five
 it
 is
 if


it
 is
 then
 the
 partnership
 makes
 sense


if
 1+
 1
 equals
 two
 we
 are
 better
 to
 stay


independent
 so
 very
 quickly
 I
 think
 we


are
 able
 to
 find
 our
 shared
 interest
 and


maximize
 our
 shared
 interest
 through
 our


discussion
 and
 negotiation
 you
 have
 been


very
 successful
 in
 in
 getting
 um
 women


at
 the
 top
 of
 your
 company
 right
 so
 it's


half
 the
 leader
 group
 I
 think
 it's
 40%


at
 mid
 level
 um
 how
 have
 you
 done
 that


yeah
 we
 have
 done
 quite
 a
 lot
 uh
 to


empower
 woman's
 leadership
 for
 example


when
 a
 woman
 is
 pregnant
 we
 offer
 free


taxi
 to
 bring
 them
 to
 work
 and
 take
 them


home
 when
 our
 employees
 give
 birth
 to
 a


baby
 we
 give
 50,000
 on
 the
 baby's


birthday
 consecutively
 for
 5
 years
 and


we
 commit
 1
 billion
 uh
 fund
 for
 this


initiatives
 and
 I
 also
 noticed
 a
 lot
 of


high
 talented
 womens
 or
 after
 they
 get


their
 master's
 degrees
 or
 phds
 some
 of


them
 are
 27
 or
 28
 years
 old
 but
 if
 you


ask
 the
 doctors
 they
 will
 classify
 in
 a


pregnancy
 after
 35
 years
 old
 as
 highrisk


pregnancy
 so
 we
 only
 giving
 women
 7
 to
 8


years
 to
 build
 a
 career
 build
 a
 family


have
 children
 compared
 to
 our
 male


co-workers
 they
 have
 much
 longer
 uh


career
 path
 to
 build
 up
 to
 that


Milestone
 so
 we
 always
 thought
 how
 we


can
 support
 women
 better
 uh
 so
 we
 come


up
 with
 a
 policy
 that
 if
 our
 woman


employee
 would
 like
 to
 use
 Hightech


techology
 to
 have
 their
 act
 Frozen
 we


will
 pay
 for
 it
 and
 that
 is
 very


Progressive
 we
 the
 first
 uh
 high-tech


company
 who
 have
 done
 it
 uh
 so
 with
 that


consulted
 efforts
 uh
 we
 have
 achieved


very
 good
 results
 as
 you
 said
 more
 than


50%
 of
 the
 workforce
 are
 women
 more
 than


40%
 of
 the
 uh
 middle
 managers
 are
 woman


and
 more
 than
 onethird
 of
 the
 executives


are
 women
 and
 I
 still
 think
 we
 can
 do


better
 in
 the
 future
 so
 you
 mentioned
 um


also
 you
 you
 thought
 women
 were
 more


empathetic
 uh
 and
 uh
 better
 able
 to
 see


other
 people's
 uh
 you
 know
 situation
 so


how
 would
 I
 experience
 life
 differently


uh
 as
 a
 normal
 employee
 in
 in
 you
 know


trip.com
 relative
 to
 your
 competitors
 so


now
 I
 come
 I
 come
 to
 work
 right
 so
 I


work
 I
 work
 for
 you
 yeah
 how
 how
 would


your
 style
 um
 make
 me
 feel
 how
 many
 it


make
 me
 work
 yeah
 so
 uh
 for
 me
 uh
 our


company
 really
 support
 our
 employees
 for


2
 hours
 2
 days
 and
 two
 years
 2
 hours
 I


think
 it's
 very
 important
 to
 give
 your


children
 your
 family
 uninterrupted
 high


quality
 2
 hours
 to
 have
 dinner
 with
 them


to
 help
 them
 with
 their
 homework
 so
 when


I
 arrange
 my
 day
 when
 I'm
 not
 troubling


I
 go
 to
 the
 office
 very
 early
 between


6:00
 to
 7:00
 I'm
 in
 the
 office
 I
 get
 all


the
 mails
 done
 uh
 all
 my
 my
 uh
 readings


then
 starting
 from
 8:00
 my
 meeting


starts
 and
 it's
 very
 tight
 when
 it's
 6


to
 8:00
 I
 pick
 pack
 up
 all
 my
 uh
 work


paper
 and
 bring
 home
 I
 have
 dinner
 with


my
 family
 help
 them
 with
 their
 homework


when
 they
 were
 young
 but
 when
 the
 kids


go
 to
 bed
 at
 about
 9:00
 us
 Market
 opens


Europe
 is
 doing
 session
 so
 all
 my


overseas
 call
 is
 done
 when
 my
 children


are
 sleeping
 I
 work
 quite
 long
 hours
 but


it
 give
 me
 peace
 in
 mind
 knowing
 every


day
 when
 I'm
 home
 I
 give
 them


undisrupted
 two
 hours
 uh
 to
 help
 them


when
 they
 grow
 up
 even
 today
 now
 they


are
 in
 college
 they're
 very
 appreciative


of
 my
 commitment
 so
 9:00
 you
 start
 to


work
 again
 and
 you
 work
 until
 when
 ah
 I


work
 until
 midnight
 sometimes
 if
 there


is
 a
 deal
 we
 work
 overnight
 uh
 but
 uh
 I


think
 being
 a
 CEO
 it
 can
 take
 you
 24


hours
 non-stop
 being
 a
 full-time
 mother


it
 can
 also
 take
 you
 24
 hours
 nonstop


but
 if
 you
 want
 to
 achieve
 both
 I
 need


to
 invest
 twice
 as
 much
 as
 if
 you
 choose


to
 do
 only
 one
 thing
 so
 that's
 the
 two


hours
 per
 day
 and
 if
 I'm
 traveling
 I


always
 try
 to
 be
 home
 and
 our
 employees


to
 to
 be
 home
 to
 spend
 the
 weekends
 two


days
 with
 our
 family
 and
 then
 two
 years


uh
 for
 women
 who
 are
 pregnant
 it's
 very


important
 to
 support
 them
 during
 the


year
 when
 they
 are
 pregnant
 and
 also


during
 the
 first
 year
 when
 they


breastfeeding
 the
 baby
 if
 you
 support


them
 during
 these
 two
 critical
 years
 I


think
 there
 is
 lots
 of
 loyalty
 from
 our


women
 uh
 workers
 and
 leaders
 and
 we're


able
 to
 retain
 talents
 and
 talking
 about


leadership
 um
 now
 you've
 been
 praised


for
 your
 crisis
 management
 skills
 right


you
 um
 ran
 the
 company
 through
 covid


perhaps
 the
 most
 challenging
 time
 for
 a


travel
 company
 ever
 right
 it
 is
 what's


the
 key
 to
 uh
 managing
 a
 company
 in
 time


of
 Crisis
 so
 our
 philosophy
 is
 customer


first
 P
 the
 second
 and
 trip.com
 the


third
 and
 if
 you
 remember
 on
 the
 Chinese


New
 Year's
 Eve
 in
 20120
 we
 lock
 down
 the


border
 to
 prevent
 the
 disease
 from


spreading
 and
 Chinese
 New
 Year
 is
 always


the
 high
 high
 season
 for
 travel
 millions


of
 customers
 already
 paid
 uh
 their


package
 uh
 packages


uh
 so
 they
 demand
 a
 refund
 but
 at
 that


time
 the
 money
 already
 is
 given
 uh
 to


the
 Airlines
 and
 hotels
 so
 we
 need
 to


make
 a
 very
 quick
 decision
 what
 do
 we
 do


customers
 are
 innocent
 they
 pay
 the


money
 now
 they
 cannot
 travel
 but
 we


don't
 have
 money
 we
 already
 give
 it
 uh


to
 the
 Airlines
 and
 hotels
 so


immediately
 within
 five
 minutes
 after


our
 executive's
 decision
 we
 made
 a


decision
 we
 need
 to
 take
 the
 leadership


provide
 the
 for
 refund
 to
 the
 customer


so
 cumulatively
 we
 borrowed
 20
 billion


to
 advance
 our
 refund
 to
 the
 customer


now
 business
 is
 back
 customer
 really


trust
 us
 they
 come
 back
 to
 us
 the
 second


thing
 is
 uh
 partner
 the
 second
 and


during
 crisis
 we
 noticed
 our
 small
 and


mediumsized
 business
 partners
 were
 very


short
 of
 cash
 so
 we
 established
 a
 2


billion
 partnership
 fund
 to
 help
 them


with
 cash
 flow
 now


businesses
 back
 all
 the
 partners
 who


would
 like
 to
 team
 up
 with
 us
 provide


the
 best
 products
 to
 our
 customers
 and


the
 third
 thing
 is
 trip.com
 the
 third
 so


at
 that
 moment
 our
 Revenue
 dropped
 down


to
 zero
 yet
 we
 have
 35,000
 employees
 to


feed
 every
 employee
 has
 a
 family
 behind


them
 so
 we
 thought
 about
 what
 we
 can
 do


so
 our
 chairman
 and
 I
 volunteered
 to
 our


board
 we
 will
 take
 zero
 salary
 until


industry
 recovered
 and
 our
 VP


immediately
 echoed
 with
 us
 they
 said


we'll
 take


50%
 salary
 cut
 and
 our
 employees
 also


echoed
 with
 us
 by
 telling
 us
 we
 will


work
 four
 days
 and
 take
 one
 day
 off
 or


work
 three
 days
 take
 three
 day
 uh
 take


two
 days
 off
 in
 reality
 everyone
 was


very
 busy
 taking
 care
 of
 our
 customers


we
 work
 overtime
 but
 that's
 the
 way
 we


tell
 our
 board
 and
 our
 shareholder
 we're


here
 together
 we'll
 weather
 the
 storm


together
 so
 sure
 enough
 after
 three
 very


difficult
 years
 we
 come
 back
 industry
 is


re
 recovery
 uh
 we
 are
 able
 to
 take
 our


customers
 to
 travel
 around
 the
 world


again
 well
 it's
 um
 it's
 uh
 a
 very
 um


strong
 Testament
 to
 your
 corpor
 culture


now
 how
 would
 you
 define
 the
 corpor


culture
 our
 corporate
 control
 is
 uh
 uh


customer
 first
 uh
 we
 need
 to
 have
 have


the
 big
 company
 dis
 discipline
 and
 a


focus
 but
 we
 also
 need
 to
 have
 a
 startup


company's
 passion
 and
 Innovation
 and
 how


do
 you
 create
 that
 so
 inside
 our
 company


uh
 we
 have
 baby
 tiger
 program
 so
 for


example
 uh
 small
 business
 uh
 rental
 car


business
 uh
 when
 they
 started
 the


business
 it
 was
 very
 small
 uh
 we
 give


them
 a
 CEO
 CFO
 and
 a
 CTO
 they
 can
 run
 as


a
 very
 small
 startup
 company
 we
 give


them
 the
 fun
 funds
 we
 take
 care
 of
 all


the
 uh
 corporate
 F
 factions
 for
 example


marketing
 legal
 uh
 contract
 negotiation


we
 have
 a
 big
 uh
 Team
 to
 support
 them


for
 them
 they
 just
 need
 to
 make
 sure


this
 product
 is
 fine
 tuned
 very
 well
 uh


so
 that
 enable
 us
 to
 have
 the
 ability
 to


launch
 70
 product


simultaneously
 um
 but
 meanwhile
 our


commitment
 to
 the
 customer
 is
 the
 same


it's
 the
 big
 com
 uh
 uh
 the
 big
 bu
 like


hotel
 and
 flight
 have
 very
 matured


processes
 for
 quality
 control
 but
 just


because
 you're
 a
 small
 business
 unit
 you


also
 need
 to
 adhere
 to
 our
 principal
 to


put
 our
 customer
 uh
 in
 the
 very
 center


uh
 position
 now
 how
 do
 you
 screen
 for


those
 type
 of
 people
 how
 do
 you
 what
 do


you
 look
 for
 when
 you
 hire
 so
 so
 now


you're
 going
 to
 so
 now
 applying
 for
 a


job
 and
 I
 had
 now
 have
 interview
 with


you
 know
 the
 big
 boss
 just
 what
 kind
 of


questions
 do
 you
 ask
 me
 we
 look
 at
 uh


the
 employees
 for
 four
 very
 important


criterias
 uh
 the
 first
 one
 is
 integrity


I
 think
 of
 Integrity
 enable
 us
 to
 have
 a


very
 open
 dialogue
 very
 transparent
 and


we
 can
 work
 together
 very
 well
 the


second
 one
 is
 hardworking
 because
 GDP
 is


created
 by
 people
 uh
 so
 hardworking


spirit
 is
 very
 important
 the
 third
 one


is
 curiosity
 always
 ask
 good
 questions


being
 very
 very
 curious
 understanding


the
 new
 trends
 what
 our
 new
 customers
 is


interested
 in
 that
 enable
 us
 to
 explore


new
 opportunities
 and
 the
 last
 one
 is


optimistic
 uh
 because
 it
 as
 a
 company


you
 will
 always
 have
 ups
 and
 downs
 how


do
 you
 screen
 for
 optimistic
 spirit
 I


ask
 them
 tell
 me
 the
 the
 most
 difficult


situation
 you
 have
 how
 did
 you
 handle
 it


that
 will
 give
 me
 a
 good
 sense
 as
 to
 is


this
 employee
 uh
 on
 a
 positive
 side
 when


he
 or
 she
 is
 facing
 the
 challenges
 right


it's
 interesting
 we
 did
 a
 podcast
 with


Magnus
 Carlson
 the
 world
 famous
 chess


player
 and
 uh
 he
 said
 that
 the


optimistic
 chess
 players
 did
 better
 yeah


more
 aggressive
 and
 and
 in
 the


investment
 Market
 uh
 uh
 you
 know


optimistic
 investors
 make
 more
 money


yeah
 so
 what's
 the
 most
 difficult
 thing


you've
 been
 through
 and
 how
 did
 you


handle
 it
 I
 think
 Co
 is
 the
 most


difficult
 thing
 for
 the
 industry
 uh
 for


for
 the
 whole
 world
 uh
 I
 think
 we


handled
 it
 uh
 very
 calm
 uh
 we
 also
 built


a
 very
 uh
 strong
 team
 uh
 during
 covid


instead
 of
 uh
 letting
 people
 go
 uh
 we


really
 focused
 on
 how
 we
 can
 run
 a
 very


lean
 operation
 and
 we
 were
 very


Innovative
 even
 during
 covid
 when
 the


hotel
 are
 closed
 down
 attractions
 closed


down
 our
 chairman
 lead
 the
 efforts
 to


dress
 up
 in
 different
 costumes
 uh
 we


bring
 limit


uh
 traffics
 uh
 to
 the
 hotel
 resorts


upsale
 for
 their
 not
 only
 room
 nights


but
 also
 meals
 um
 because
 during
 those


time
 any
 cash
 flow
 to
 our
 hotel
 Partners


is
 very
 precious
 so
 Innovation
 and
 a


commitment
 for
 our
 industry
 uh
 is
 very


important
 how
 transparent
 are
 you
 in


your
 company
 how
 do
 you
 share


information
 we're
 very
 transparent
 uh
 we


our
 philosophy
 is
 we
 need
 to


scientifically
 manage
 our
 company
 so


number
 speaking
 uh
 we
 use
 number
 uh
 for


all
 the
 analysis
 so
 a
 company
 a
 bu
 if


they
 tell
 me
 oh
 the
 opportunity
 is
 great


that
 doesn't
 get
 you
 anywhere
 you
 need


to
 show
 me
 the
 number
 right
 I've


listened
 to
 some
 of
 your
 speeches
 at


some
 of
 these
 industry
 Gatherings
 and


you
 you
 talk
 about
 numbers
 all
 the
 time


because
 I
 have
 a
 finance
 background
 uh


so
 I
 always
 focus
 on
 numbers
 so
 if
 you


show
 me
 a
 very
 high
 I
 of
 course
 the
 uh


resources
 is
 strongly
 behind
 you
 but
 but


if
 the
 II
 doesn't
 make
 any
 sense
 no


matter
 how
 good
 the
 story
 you're
 telling


the
 team
 return
 on
 investment
 yes
 yeah


what
 are
 the
 numbers
 you
 look
 at
 every


day
 I
 look
 at
 uh
 the
 industry
 growth
 so


for
 example
 uh
 we
 look
 at
 the
 Baseline


how
 fast
 the
 GDP
 grows
 it
 is
 so
 maybe


around
 5%
 and
 then
 I
 also
 look
 at
 the


travel
 industry
 normally
 travel
 industry


can
 be
 a
 couple
 of
 percentage
 above
 GDP


growth
 so
 somewhere
 around
 8
 to
 10%
 and


then
 our
 team
 needs
 to
 execute
 very
 well


to
 grow
 faster
 the
 lead
 lead
 the


Industry
 Recovery
 so
 we
 probably
 will


Target
 at
 somewhere
 between
 15
 to
 20%


ker
 going
 forward
 and
 every
 day
 you
 come


to
 work
 what
 are
 the
 numbers
 you
 look
 at


I
 look
 at
 uh
 the
 gross
 proceeds
 we
 bring


to
 our
 business
 partners
 that's
 the
 most


important
 items
 I
 look
 at
 moving
 on
 to


the
 travel
 industry
 just
 now
 what
 are


the
 trends
 you're
 seeing
 the
 new
 trend
 I


classify
 them
 as
 three
 e
 the
 first
 one


is
 event
 driven
 so
 young
 people
 are
 very


interested
 in
 concerts
 uh
 music


festivals
 sports
 events
 so
 events
 driven


uh
 Travelers
 is
 traveling
 is
 very


popular
 right
 now
 among
 our
 young


traveler
 Taylor
 Swift
 Taylor
 Swift
 is
 a


phenomenal
 and
 a
 lot
 more


uh
 music
 uh
 uh
 artists
 the
 second
 one
 is


uh
 a
 more
 experiential
 uh
 travel
 so


Wellness
 travel
 uh
 ski
 in
 the
 winter


diving
 in
 the
 summer
 hiking
 in
 the


spring
 becomes
 also
 very
 important
 we


need
 to
 support
 our
 customers
 for
 these


type
 of
 uh
 tools
 the
 third
 one
 is


eco-friendliness
 travel
 our
 young
 people


really
 focus
 a
 lot
 on
 that
 so
 we
 offer


electronic
 vehicle
 for
 rental
 cars
 we


encourage
 our
 hotel
 Partners
 to
 install


a
 solar
 panel
 to
 reduce
 emission
 and
 in


terms
 of
 Chinese
 travel
 how
 is
 that


developing
 just
 now
 oh
 very
 well
 uh
 so


we
 look
 at
 both
 the
 man
 side
 and
 supply


side
 on
 the
 demand
 side
 the
 search


volume
 for
 overseas
 alang
 travel
 far


exceeded
 209
 level
 so
 the
 demand
 is


there
 the
 buying
 power
 is
 there
 uh
 I
 was


with
 the
 executive
 in
 the
 Dubai
 airport


uh
 they
 are
 telling
 me
 that
 the


customers
 buying
 power
 from
 trip.com
 is


two
 to
 three
 times
 as
 high
 as
 the


average
 buyers
 uh
 in
 their
 airport
 so


they
 love
 to
 bring
 Chinese
 customers
 to


the
 aut
 it
 help
 them
 with
 their
 sales


volume
 however
 on
 the
 supply
 side
 we


still
 have
 two
 major
 bottleneck
 the


first
 one
 is
 the
 visa
 application
 uh


some
 countries
 give
 three
 Visa
 uh
 like


AB
 uh
 UAE
 Saudi
 Arabia
 Qatar
 Singapore


uh
 Malaysia
 Thailand
 they're
 doing
 very


well
 but
 some
 other
 countries
 still
 have


a
 long
 pent
 demand
 such
 as
 uh
 Germany


has
 a
 long
 waiting
 list
 for
 six
 months


um
 and
 some
 other
 countries
 Switzerland


does
 very
 well
 within
 s
 days
 you
 can
 get


the
 visa
 if
 you
 use
 expedited
 Services


you
 can
 get
 the
 visa
 within
 the
 same
 day


so
 why
 does
 Germany
 have
 such
 a
 long


waiting
 list
 um
 you
 have
 thought
 they


wanted
 to
 have
 tourists
 right
 yeah
 I


think
 every
 country
 wants
 to
 you
 know


attract
 uh
 Travelers
 but
 I
 think


probably
 the
 backlog
 uh
 through
 the


pandemic
 time
 is
 very
 high
 and
 also
 they


might
 are
 looking
 for
 uh
 new
 working
 uh


uh
 Power
 uh
 to
 process
 these
 back
 how


does
 No
 Way
 St
 up
 here
 no
 way
 is
 in
 in


between
 right
 yeah
 but
 it's
 a
 beautiful


country


and
 very
 this
 is
 the
 first
 country
 I


visited
 after
 Co
 it's
 beautiful
 but
 how


so
 how
 long
 time
 did
 you
 take
 you
 to
 get


a
 visa
 to
 come
 here
 uh
 about
 one
 month


also
 one
 month
 now
 Mass
 tourism
 there's


been
 um
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 backlash
 in
 many


parts
 of
 the
 world
 just
 because
 there


are
 too
 many
 tourists
 right
 in
 places


like
 Venice
 and
 so
 on
 and
 they're
 trying


to
 reduce
 it
 so
 what
 what
 is
 your
 view


on
 that
 yeah
 I
 think
 uh
 for
 very
 top


travel
 destinations
 uh
 we
 really
 need
 to


uh
 provide
 a
 good
 alternative
 for


travelers
 uh
 if
 they
 have
 uh
 the
 buying


power
 is
 good
 for
 the
 local
 economy
 when


we
 look
 at
 the
 global
 GDP
 travel
 can


provide
 about
 10%
 plus
 GDP
 contribution


to
 the
 global
 economy
 and
 provide
 more


than
 10%
 of
 the
 job
 opportunity
 so
 it's


very
 good
 for
 local
 economy
 but
 we
 need


to

 uh
 a
 good
 uh
 uh
 content
 for


the
 longtail
 products
 for
 example
 Italy


it's
 beautiful
 Rome
 and
 Florence
 is


beautiful
 but
 so
 does
 uh
 lots
 of
 remote


areas
 which
 is
 very
 beautiful
 as
 well
 we


need
 to
 do
 a
 very
 good
 job
 so
 that's
 why


our
 content
 team
 provides
 a
 very
 good


alternative
 so
 customers
 can
 see
 not


only
 Rome
 and
 Florence
 they
 will
 see


sento
 they
 will
 see
 simani
 all
 these


beautiful
 places
 the
 world
 is
 so
 big


there
 are
 so
 many
 places
 you
 can
 see


just
 moving
 on
 to
 some
 more
 um
 personal


questions
 um
 you
 uh
 run
 half
 marathons


that's
 right
 I
 R
 uh
 preco
 I
 run
 one
 or


two
 full
 Marathon
 uh
 on
 the
 weekend
 I


try
 to
 run
 a
 half


marathon
 like
 every
 weekend
 yeah
 try
 to


wow
 if
 I'm
 not
 and
 you
 came
 here
 and
 you


came
 here
 on
 Crites
 because
 you
 uh


you've
 been
 having
 a
 skiing
 accident
 as


well
 right
 that's
 right
 so
 my
 family
 in


the
 winter
 I
 enjoy
 skiing
 in
 a
 summer
 we


like
 to
 take
 our
 children
 to
 dive
 and
 in


Spring
 and
 the
 fall
 we
 do
 a
 lot
 of


hiking
 what
 is
 your
 absolute
 most


favorite
 place
 to
 travel
 I
 think
 Africa


Safari
 is
 my
 favorite
 right
 and
 what
 is


it
 with
 African
 safari
 which
 close
 to


Nature
 uh
 if
 you
 believe
 in
 the
 origin


uh
 theories
 of
 origin
 uh
 humans
 uh
 moved


from
 Africa
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 so


when
 we
 go
 back
 to
 Africa
 uh
 we
 we
 feel


we're
 going
 back
 home
 M
 how
 do
 you
 relax


um
 I
 do
 lots
 of
 exercise
 I
 have
 lots
 of


friends
 uh
 I
 have
 spent
 a
 quality
 time


with
 my
 families
 and
 I
 read
 a
 lot
 what


do
 you
 read
 when
 I
 was
 young
 I
 enjoy
 toy


stor
 three
 masterpieces
 and
 one
 piece
 is


my
 favorite
 uh
 now
 I
 read
 uh
 Henry


Kissinger's
 uh
 leadership
 um
 and
 I
 also


read
 a
 book
 to
 help
 uh
 Health
 uh
 for


example
 outlive
 uh
 it's
 a
 very
 good
 book


uh
 and
 also
 antifragile
 it's
 good
 for
 uh


personal
 uh
 health
 and
 also
 very
 good


for
 the
 health
 of
 our
 company
 and
 a


community
 are
 you
 going
 to
 write
 a
 book


yes
 when
 I
 have
 more
 time
 and
 what
 what


will
 you
 write
 about
 I
 want
 to
 write


what
 I
 have
 experienced
 I
 think
 our


generation
 is
 very
 blessed
 uh
 my


grandmother
 uh
 she
 was
 very
 talented
 but


she
 was
 taught
 to
 stay
 at
 home
 to
 take


care
 of
 their
 children
 and
 my
 mother
 was


very
 talented
 so
 they
 were
 the


generation
 uh
 taught
 uh
 who
 were
 taught


woman
 can
 hold
 half
 of
 the
 sky
 so
 she


became
 a
 chemistry
 engineer
 but
 she


could
 only
 be
 a
 individual
 contributor


and
 in
 my
 generation
 I
 always
 feel
 I'm


very
 blessed
 for
 the
 opportunity
 we
 can


can
 go
 to
 work
 we
 can
 lead
 a
 big
 team


but
 still
 there
 are
 so
 many
 things
 that


we
 can
 do
 more
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 global


uh
 Prime
 Ministers
 and
 presidents
 fewer


than
 10%
 of
 them
 are
 represented
 by


woman
 and
 I
 always
 imagine
 if
 we
 can


have
 50%
 of
 the
 prime
 ministers
 and


president
 represents
 by
 woman
 will
 we
 be


able
 to
 find
 a
 better
 Sol
 solution
 a


peaceful
 solution
 for
 many
 of
 the
 issues


and
 many
 of
 the
 conflicts
 well
 we
 have
 a


better
 world
 because
 of
 the


representation
 by
 half
 of
 our
 population


how
 many
 women
 how
 many
 mother
 would


like
 to
 send
 their
 sons
 to
 fight
 a
 war


to
 sacrifice
 their
 sons
 um
 so
 I
 think


there
 are
 much
 more
 we
 can
 do
 and
 I
 want


to
 contribute
 uh
 my
 uh
 efforts
 to
 this


course
 well
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 fantastic


place
 to
 end
 so
 a
 world
 with
 more
 female


leaders
 will
 be
 a
 better
 world
 thank
 you


very
 much
 for
 your
 support
 thank
 you
 so


much
