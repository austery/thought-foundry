Before
 we
 get
 into
 the
 episode,
 our


conversation
 today
 includes
 discussions


about
 cancer
 diagnosis
 and
 treatment,


medical
 mistreatment,
 the
 use
 of


discriminatory
 language,
 and
 child
 sex


abuse.
 Please
 listen
 with
 care.
 If


you're
 feeling
 like
 you
 need
 support,


we've
 got
 resources
 listed
 in
 our
 show


notes.


You're
 listening
 to
 Mistreated.
 I'm
 Nam


Kiwanuka.
 Being
 diagnosed
 with
 cancer
 is


a
 gut
 punch.
 Whatever
 the
 case,
 whatever


age,
 a
 cancer
 diagnosis
 is
 life-changing


and
 people
 are
 being
 diagnosed
 younger.


According
 to
 the
 British
 Medical


Journal,
 between
 1990
 to
 2019,
 early


onset
 cancer
 diagnoses
 increased
 by
 79%.


There
 are
 a
 number
 of
 possible
 reasons


why
 case
 numbers
 are
 going
 up.
 What
 we


do
 know
 is
 that
 by
 2050,
 global
 cancer


diagnoses
 are
 set
 to
 increase
 by
 75%.


This
 from
 a
 report
 in
 the
 Lancet,
 a


peer-reviewed
 medical
 journal.
 It's
 also


difficult
 to
 get
 a
 diagnosis
 because
 in


many
 jurisdictions,
 testing
 is
 based
 on


age.
 Advocacy
 groups
 across
 Canada
 have


called
 for
 the
 lowering
 of
 age
 limits


for
 colon
 and
 breast
 cancer
 screenings.


Experts
 warned
 that
 if
 the
 age
 limit
 is


lowered,
 we
 could
 see
 more
 false


positives.


But
 if
 someone
 feels
 unwell
 or
 is


worried
 they
 have
 cancer,
 why
 should


their
 age
 prevent
 them
 from
 getting
 the


care
 they
 need?


In
 2024,
 the
 Ontario
 government
 lowered


the
 age
 for
 breast
 cancer
 screening
 from


50
 to
 40
 to
 allow
 more
 women
 access
 to


screening
 services.
 There
 is
 a


perception
 that
 breast
 cancer
 runs
 in


the
 family,
 but
 studies
 show
 that
 80%
 of


women
 who
 are
 diagnosed
 with
 breast


cancer
 don't
 have
 a
 family
 history
 of


it.
 So,
 what's
 it
 like
 to
 be
 diagnosed


at
 a
 young
 age?
 We
 reached
 out
 to


Faracan,
 a
 young
 mother
 of
 one
 who
 was


diagnosed
 with
 two
 different
 cancers,


breast
 and
 cervical.
 We
 spoke
 about
 what


it
 was
 like
 to
 navigate
 two
 cancer


diagnosis
 and
 what
 that
 meant
 for
 her


family,
 her
 career,
 her
 life.
 This
 was


probably
 one
 of
 the
 most
 moving
 and
 one


of
 the
 toughest
 conversations
 I've
 had


on
 the
 podcast
 so
 far.
 But
 through
 the


tears,
 there
 was
 laughter
 and
 joy.
 It's


important
 for
 us
 to
 hear
 about
 these


experiences
 because
 they
 give
 us
 a
 full


understanding
 of
 the
 challenges
 our


healthcare
 system
 poses.
 Farra
 Khan


joins
 me
 now.


[Music]


>> Farrah
 Khan,
 welcome
 to
 the
 podcast.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Uh,
 could
 you
 please
 introduce
 yourself


and
 what
 you
 do?


>> Oh
 my
 gosh,
 that's
 a
 great
 question.


What
 do
 I
 do?
 Um,
 I'm
 a
 mom.
 No.
 Um,


>> of
 course.


>> But
 yeah,
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 when
 people


ask
 now
 after
 being
 ill,
 I
 just
 don't


want
 my
 work
 to
 be
 the
 first
 thing.


>> So
 I'm
 a
 mother.
 I'm
 a
 family
 member.


I'm
 also
 a
 consultant
 on
 gender
 equity.


I
 do
 systems
 change
 work
 with


corporations,
 governments,
 organizations


to
 help
 them
 move
 their
 goals
 to
 action.


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 talk


about
 motherhood.
 We
 must.
 Um,
 but
 you


know,
 take
 me
 back
 to
 age
 44.
 You


finally
 have
 your
 dream
 job
 and
 your


baby's
 about
 to
 graduate
 from


kindergarten.
 Uh,
 you
 and
 your
 spouse


are
 talking
 about
 having
 uh
 the


potential
 of
 having
 another
 baby
 and
 you


go
 to
 your
 doctor
 to
 talk
 about
 this


possibility.
 What
 happens
 next?


>> Yeah.
 And
 my
 my
 child
 was
 graduated


preschool,
 so
 he
 was
 he
 was
 young.
 He


was
 three.
 Um,
 so
 I
 went
 to
 my
 doctor


and
 you
 know,
 we
 do
 a
 pap
 test
 every


year
 because
 I'm
 in
 the
 more
 high
 risk


for
 cervical
 cancer.
 So
 I
 get
 tested


every
 year.
 Um,
 and
 they
 did
 uh
 the


regular
 test
 and
 what
 they
 found
 is


blood


and
 usually
 that's
 a
 sign
 of
 something


not
 right.
 And
 I've
 been
 there
 before.


So,
 you
 know,
 I
 knew
 that
 I
 had
 to
 go


for
 a
 leap
 and
 I
 had
 to
 go
 to
 a


specialist.


But
 something
 felt
 different
 this
 time.


And
 I
 when
 I
 went
 to
 the
 specialist,
 it


was
 pretty
 horrifying.
 I
 went
 to
 a


specialist,
 a
 gynecologist,


and
 she
 was
 very
 gruff,


trauma-informed
 in
 the
 way
 that
 she
 made


sure
 there
 was
 another
 person
 there
 that


held
 my
 hand.
 You
 know,
 I
 remember
 her


rubbing
 my
 leg
 and
 when
 and
 telling
 me


to
 open
 my
 knees
 so
 she
 could
 go
 in


between
 and
 go
 inside
 my
 vagina
 to
 do


scraping


of
 my
 cervix.
 Um,
 but
 while
 she
 was


there,
 so
 I
 am
 in
 this
 really
 vulnerable


position


and
 she
 looks
 to
 the
 other
 resident,
 the


resident
 there,
 and
 this
 is
 a
 doctor


who's
 been
 working
 for
 a
 very
 long
 time


and
 says
 to
 them,


"Watch
 this."


And
 then
 I
 have
 to
 take
 a
 moment
 because


of
 course,
 please
 take
 Yeah,
 take
 a


moment.
 Um,
 she


then
 looks
 at
 me
 and
 says,
 "Have
 you


ever
 slept
 with
 men?"


And
 I
 said,
 "Yeah."


>> And
 this
 is
 again
 while
 you're
 on
 the


>> Yeah.
 And
 she
 already
 in
 my
 chart
 had


said
 that
 I
 was
 a
 lesbian,
 which
 I
 am.


Um,
 and
 she
 said, "Have
 you
 ever
 slept


with
 men?"
 And
 she
 was
 talking
 about
 sis


men.
 And
 I
 said,
 "Yes."
 turns
 to
 the


resident
 and
 says,
 "See,


most
 lesbians
 start
 sleeping
 with
 men


first."
 And
 it
 was
 that
 moment
 that
 felt


so
 unsafe.


>> And
 this
 is
 when
 you
 found
 out
 that
 you


had
 the
 cervical
 cancer.


>> This
 is
 when
 she's
 scraping
 out
 my


cervix
 and
 she
 pulled
 a
 pull-up
 out
 of


my
 cer
 my
 cervix
 as
 well.


>> And
 I'm
 guessing
 with
 no
 pain


medication.


>> No
 pain
 medication.
 I
 was
 bleeding


profusely.
 Um,
 I
 was
 started
 to
 be
 in
 a


daysaze
 and
 I
 was
 just
 so
 shocked
 and
 I


sat
 up.
 I
 was
 shocked
 by
 her
 comment
 and


I
 was
 shocked
 that
 she
 just
 casually


pulled
 a
 pull-up
 out
 of
 like
 ripped
 out


of
 my
 body
 which
 I
 found
 out
 later
 that


people
 get
 anesthesia
 people
 go
 under
 to


get
 pull-ups
 removed.
 Um,
 and
 she
 pulled


out
 a
 a
 mass


and
 said,
 "You
 know,
 we're
 going
 to
 go


get
 this
 biopsy,
 but
 I
 wouldn't
 worry


too
 much."
 And
 I
 was
 sitting
 up
 at
 that


point.
 Blood
 was
 all
 over
 me,
 all
 over


that
 um
 all
 over
 my
 um
 all
 over
 the
 It's


just
 so
 hard
 to
 talk
 about
 sometimes.


>> I'm
 so
 sorry.


>> That's
 okay.
 Um
 I
 sat
 up
 after
 she
 did


that
 in
 a
 days
 and
 there
 was
 blood


pooling
 um


around
 my
 crotch
 area
 um
 just
 like
 at


the
 table
 and
 she
 didn't
 clean
 it
 up
 and


I
 sat
 there
 in
 a
 days
 and
 she
 just
 put


things
 away.
 She
 said,
 "You
 know,
 we'll


call
 you
 in
 a
 couple
 weeks
 when
 we
 get


the
 biopsy."


>> And
 that
 was
 that.
 And
 then
 they
 left


the
 room.


>> They
 left
 the
 room.
 the
 resident


squeezed
 my
 knee


and
 then,
 you
 know,
 looked
 apologetic


but
 didn't
 say
 anything.


Um,


and
 then
 I
 went
 home
 and
 I
 started
 to


get
 a
 little
 bit
 anxious,
 but
 everybody


was
 like, "It's
 going to
 be
 fine
 cuz


I've
 been
 there
 before.
 It'll
 be
 fine."


Couple
 days
 later,
 she
 calls
 me
 and
 just


says,
 "Come
 to
 my
 office."
 And
 I
 didn't


think
 anything.
 She
 didn't
 tell
 me
 to


bring
 my
 partner.
 She
 didn't
 tell
 me
 to


bring
 a
 friend.
 She
 just
 said,
 "Come
 to


my
 office."
 And
 I
 just
 went
 because
 I


didn't
 think
 anything
 would
 be
 wrong.


And
 also,
 I
 thought
 if
 something
 was


wrong,
 she
 would
 tell
 me
 to
 bring


people.


And
 I
 sat
 down
 in
 her
 office.
 I
 was


brought
 in.
 And
 she
 when
 she
 came
 in


without
 even
 closing
 the
 door
 behind


her,
 she
 says,
 "Yep,
 you
 got
 it.
 You
 got


the
 really
 bad
 cervical
 cancer."


And
 what
 she
 meant
 is
 I
 have
 the
 small


cell
 endocrine
 cervical
 cancer,
 which
 is


extremely
 rare.
 About
 1,300


women
 and
 general
 binary
 people


get
 cervical
 cancer
 every
 year
 in


Canada.


But
 out
 of
 those
 only
 2%
 or
 even
 less


than
 get
 small
 cell
 cervical
 cancer
 and


I
 had
 small
 cell
 cervical
 cancer
 and
 my


tumor
 was
 just
 growing.
 They
 had
 cut


part
 of
 it
 off
 when
 they
 did
 the
 biopsy.


Um
 but
 then
 they
 it
 just
 kept
 growing


and
 it
 was
 scary.
 It
 was
 extremely


scary.
 And
 that
 was
 in,
 you
 know,
 early


June
 2023.


My
 son
 was
 going
 to
 turn
 four
 in
 a


couple
 days
 and
 it
 was
 the
 anniversary


of
 my
 father's
 death
 from
 pancreatic


cancer.


I
 was
 a
 mess.


But
 I
 also
 was
 in
 that
 moment
 of
 what
 am


I
 going
 to
 do
 about
 my
 job?


Can
 I
 slow
 this
 down?
 So
 I
 literally


thought
 you
 know
 it
 will
 still
 be
 okay


like
 I
 had
 that
 hope.
 A
 lot
 of
 women
 who


have
 the
 cancer
 that
 I
 did.
 So
 small


cell
 cervical
 cancer
 don't
 live
 if
 they


have
 surgery
 first
 to
 have
 a
 hyctomy.


So
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 had
 to
 do
 was


radiation
 and
 chemo.
 And
 it
 was
 like


things
 were
 moving
 so
 fast.
 And
 I'll


never
 forget
 I
 said
 to
 the
 doctor


because
 work
 was
 such
 a
 priority
 in
 my


life
 um
 you
 know
 can
 we
 hold
 off
 this


treatment
 until
 I
 do
 my
 job
 you
 know
 do


I
 have
 to
 go
 to
 Rwanda
 um
 to
 this


international
 conference
 I
 you
 know
 have


all
 this
 work
 I
 need
 to
 be
 doing
 can


this
 wait
 and
 she
 was
 like
 oh
 no
 I
 don't


think
 you
 understand
 you
 are
 not
 working


as
 of
 Now


>> we
 don't
 have
 to
 go
 anywhere
 that
 you


don't
 feel
 comfortable.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 that
 piece
 around


like
 I'm
 just
 taking
 a
 breath
 to
 process


what
 you're
 telling
 me
 because
 um
 the


way
 that
 you've
 been
 treated
 is
 just
 so


inhumane
 and
 I'm
 so
 sorry
 for
 that.
 Um,


and
 I
 just
 want
 people
 who
 are
 listening


and
 or
 watching
 this
 to
 understand
 that


those
 biopsies,
 like
 you're
 literally


taking
 tissue
 from
 the
 inside
 of


someone's
 body.


>> Yeah.


>> With
 no
 medication.
 It's
 extremely


painful.
 I've
 gone
 through
 the
 same


thing.
 But


>> what
 you
 just
 described
 um


is
 just
 it's
 like
 a
 straight
 out
 of
 a


horror
 film.


>> Yeah.
 It
 it
 was
 shameful.
 And
 it
 wasn't


the
 first
 time
 that
 it
 happened.
 A


decade
 before
 that
 or
 a
 little
 bit
 more,


I
 got
 my
 first
 diagnosis
 with


pre
 pre-ervical
 cancer.
 So
 like
 the
 um


and
 I
 had
 gone
 to,
 you
 know,
 to
 a


specialist


and
 I
 remember
 lying
 there
 and
 just


weeping
 cuz
 I
 was
 so
 overwhelmed.
 And


then
 he
 was
 like,
 "You
 need
 to
 calm
 down


so
 I
 can
 do
 this."


And
 when
 he
 started
 the
 procedure
 of


scraping
 and
 taking
 out
 a
 part
 of
 my


body,
 which
 is
 going
 in,
 you
 know,
 to


take
 out
 the
 tissue,
 I
 said,


you
 know,
 can
 I
 can
 I
 still
 have


children?
 That
 was
 my
 big
 fear.
 Can
 I


still
 have
 children?
 And
 he
 looked
 at
 me


and
 said,
 well,
 you're
 a
 lesbian,
 so
 you


should
 just
 adopt.


And
 you're
 so
 vulnerable
 at
 that
 time.


you're
 alone
 because
 they
 don't
 want


somebody
 in
 the
 procedure
 with
 you


because
 it's
 not
 treated
 as
 something


that's
 serious.
 And
 this
 is
 what
 we
 see


consistently.
 Women's
 bodies,
 women's


health,
 women's
 pain
 is
 not
 taken


seriously.
 And
 I
 think
 especially
 as
 a


racialized
 woman,
 we
 are
 expected
 to


hold
 pain
 differently.
 And
 there's
 all


kinds
 of
 research
 about
 it,
 especially


around
 black
 women
 and
 indigenous
 women.


So
 I
 think
 in
 those
 moments
 the


dehumanization
 is
 so
 clear.


>> Um
 you've
 written
 about
 your
 experience


as
 a
 queer
 person
 u
 when
 seeking
 health


care
 before
 and
 you
 once
 shared
 that
 a


doctor
 dissuaded
 you
 from
 getting
 a


papsmear
 because
 quote
 since
 I
 was
 no


longer
 having
 sex
 with
 men
 he
 felt
 it


was
 unnecessary


and
 soon
 you
 would
 you
 would
 find
 out


that
 you
 also
 have
 breast
 cancer.
 Um,


what
 was
 it
 like
 to
 navigate
 a
 health


care
 system
 where
 your
 identity
 is


otherredthered


when
 your
 life
 is
 at
 in
 the
 balance?


Terrifying
 because
 I
 was
 still
 getting


care
 from
 some
 of
 the
 doctors
 that
 were


saying
 those
 things
 to
 me.
 Also,
 people


don't
 believe
 you
 when
 you
 say
 that
 that


happened
 that
 someone
 said
 such
 an


atrocious
 thing
 to
 you.


Like
 I
 it's


>> Why
 do
 you
 think
 that
 is?


I
 think
 people
 don't
 understand
 the


depth
 of
 homophobia
 and
 racism
 and
 its


impact
 on
 you
 seeking
 support.
 If
 I


hadn't
 met


health
 advocate
 and
 professor


Dr.
 Noticia
 Mascoy
 when
 I
 had
 just
 kind


of
 given
 up
 on
 going
 to
 get
 papsmears
 in


my
 late
 teens
 early
 20s
 cuz
 I
 was
 just


like
 this
 is
 horrible
 the
 way
 I
 was


being
 treated
 but
 she
 luckily
 um
 was
 the


executive
 director
 of
 Women's
 Health


Women's
 Hands
 which
 is
 a
 healthcare


center
 for
 women
 of
 color
 and
 I
 was
 for


the
 first
 time
 able
 to
 access


traumainformed


care.
 But
 even
 there,
 you
 know,
 they


sent
 me
 to
 that
 doctor
 for
 the
 cervical


care.
 And
 when
 I
 came
 back
 and
 told
 one


of
 the
 doctors,
 she
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 he's


so
 good.
 We
 send
 him
 so
 many
 clients.
 I


I
 don't
 think
 he
 would
 say
 something


like
 that."
 Yeah,
 he
 would.
 He
 did.


>> You
 just
 said
 something
 that's
 really


important.
 You
 were
 being
 otherred
 in


that
 system
 already.
 So,
 at
 one
 point,


you
 actually
 thought
 about
 not
 getting


papsmears
 because
 of
 those
 experiences.


>> Yeah.
 and
 then
 you
 end
 up
 having


>> cervical
 cancer.


>> I'm
 sure.
 Have
 you
 sat
 with
 that
 and


thought,
 "What
 if
 I
 stopped?"
 Because


you
 also
 found
 precancer
 cells
 at
 one


point.


>> Yeah.


I
 think
 I
 would
 be
 dead,
 you
 know?
 And
 I


think
 that's
 the
 thing.
 So
 many


racialized
 women,
 black
 women,


indigenous
 women,
 trans
 people


don't
 access
 care
 because
 of
 our


horrific
 experiences
 with
 the
 medical


system.
 And
 it's
 partly
 individual


doctors,
 yes,
 and
 nurses,
 but
 it's
 also


the
 education
 system
 that
 they
 go


through
 that
 treats
 women's
 health
 as
 a


minor
 subject.


that
 tests
 and
 research
 isn't
 centering


women.
 Um,
 and
 also
 that
 queer
 people


are
 not
 seen
 at
 all.
 When
 I
 think
 about


some
 of
 the
 pamphlets
 I
 was
 given
 after


going
 through
 months
 of
 radiation
 on
 my


pelvis
 which
 impacted
 my
 ability
 to
 have


if
 I
 wanted
 to
 penetrative
 sex
 or
 have


an
 internal
 exam
 because
 radiation


affects
 pelvic
 radiation
 affects
 all


kinds
 of
 things.


All
 the
 pamphlets
 I
 received
 were
 based


on
 heterosexual
 women
 and
 the
 idea
 that


they
 would
 have
 penetrative
 sex


in
 a
 with
 heterosexual
 men,
 right?
 So


cis
 men.
 Um,
 and
 there
 was
 really
 no


discussion
 about
 people
 like
 me.


And
 people
 think
 that
 that's
 not
 a
 big


deal,
 but
 it's
 a
 huge
 deal.


Well,
 you've
 also
 written,
 and
 I
 just


want
 to
 quote
 this
 part.
 Um,
 you've


written,
 "While
 Canada
 is
 by
 many


measures
 a
 progressive
 country,
 it's


easy
 to
 forget
 that
 we
 have
 a
 very


recent
 history
 of
 institutionalized


homophobia,
 the
 effects
 of
 which
 still


linger
 throughout
 our
 society,
 including


in
 healthcare.
 Homosexuality
 was


considered
 a
 mental
 illness
 by
 the


Canadian
 Psychiatric
 Association
 until


1982.
 And
 conversion
 therapy,
 a
 known


harmful
 treatment
 aimed
 at
 changing
 a


person's
 sexual
 orientation
 or
 gender


identity,
 was
 only
 outlawed
 nationwide


in
 2022.
 That's
 like
 3
 years
 knowing
 all


of
 this
 uh
 because
 of
 the
 work
 that
 you


do
 uh
 and
 having
 experienced
 that
 bias


when
 you
 were
 younger.
 We
 often
 hear


that
 um
 your
 mental
 health
 uh
 if
 you're


stressed
 out
 or
 if
 you
 don't
 feel
 safe


um
 when
 you're
 having
 a
 physical


illness,
 it
 can
 actually
 just
 make
 you


more
 sick.
 So
 having
 to
 navigate
 not
 one


but
 two
 cancers
 in
 the
 system
 that
 you


didn't
 feel
 uh
 safe
 in.
 Um,
 how
 did
 you


like
 I'm
 just
 like
 how
 did
 you
 mentally


what
 how
 did
 that
 impact
 you
 your
 mental


health
 and
 perhaps
 your
 physical
 health


as
 well?


>> I
 think
 in
 part
 this
 impacted
 me


mentally
 even
 before
 I
 received
 my


diagnosis.


I
 was
 under
 so
 much
 stress
 in
 the


industry
 I
 was
 in
 at
 the
 time.
 I
 worked


for


25
 years
 in
 the
 sexual
 assault
 and


violence
 against
 women
 sector
 and
 did
 so


much
 in
 that
 sector
 that
 didn't
 really


take
 care
 of
 us.
 You
 know,
 it's


underpaid.
 It's
 not
 seen
 as
 um
 skilled


work
 often.
 So
 there's
 so
 much
 stress


and
 then
 you
 add
 in
 layers
 of
 racism,


homophobia,


>> and
 even
 the
 emotional
 labor
 because


>> the
 stories
 that
 you're
 hearing.


>> Yes.
 And
 then
 you
 add
 in
 the
 emotional


labor
 and
 the
 intellectual
 labor
 of


constantly
 having
 to
 explain
 to
 people


in
 the
 medical
 system
 how
 to
 care
 for


you
 and
 then
 their
 expectations
 for
 you


to
 teach
 them


>> or
 be
 quiet.
 or
 be
 quiet.
 But
 a
 lot
 of


teachable
 moments
 being
 seen
 as


teachable,
 you
 know,
 in
 a
 way
 that
 felt


really
 uncomfortable.
 So,
 getting
 DMs


from
 doctors
 while
 I'm
 going
 through


breast
 cancer
 treatment
 and
 treatment


for
 cervical
 cancer.
 Um,
 oh,
 your
 um


your
 insights
 you
 gave
 me
 when
 you
 were


giving
 me
 feedback
 about
 my
 care
 were


really
 helpful.
 Can
 you
 look
 at
 these


slides
 that
 I
 put
 together?


No.
 or
 being
 asked
 by
 upper
 management


in
 a
 hospital
 after
 you
 made
 a
 complaint


um
 after
 I
 made
 a
 complaint
 of
 I
 was
 set


up
 with
 a
 social
 worker
 and
 when
 I
 asked


them
 what
 training
 they
 had
 to
 work
 with


LGBTQ
 people
 or
 with
 racialized
 people,


uh
 they
 saidnone
 and
 I
 said
 I
 don't


think
 we'd
 be
 a
 good
 fit
 to
 work


together
 then.
 And
 when
 I
 made
 a


complaint
 about
 that
 um
 to
 to
 the


hospital
 system,
 they
 wanted
 me
 to


connect
 to
 their
 equity
 team
 to
 give
 my


feedback
 so
 they
 could
 build
 a
 better


hospital.
 But
 that's
 not
 always
 my
 job.


I
 just
 want
 a
 social
 worker
 so
 I
 have


support
 with
 my
 mental
 health.
 So
 it


takes
 so
 much
 work
 to
 do
 all
 this


education


that
 there
 was
 a
 point
 where
 I
 gave
 up


on
 it
 and
 I
 didn't
 say
 things.
 So,


example,
 um
 I
 got
 radiation
 and
 I
 wore


period
 underwear
 because
 I
 was
 bleeding


a
 lot.
 Um


and
 in
 one
 of
 the
 MRI
 tests,
 I
 said,
 "I


have
 my
 period
 and
 um
 I'm
 wearing
 period


underwear.
 Is
 that
 okay
 to
 go
 through


the
 machine?"
 And
 they
 said,
 "Oh,
 no.


You
 you
 got
 to
 take
 those
 off."
 So,
 I


had
 no
 underwear
 on
 and
 uh
 they
 didn't


give
 me
 a
 pad,
 so
 I
 just
 free
 blood
 on


the
 MRI
 table.
 Um
 during
 that,
 like
 just


bled
 everywhere.
 No
 pad,
 not
 even
 like
 a


medical
 pad
 on
 the
 on
 the
 bottom
 of
 me.


>> It's
 dehumanizing.


>> You
 aren't
 a
 human.
 You're
 in
 a
 meat


locker.


A
 lot
 of
 the
 treatments
 felt
 like
 that.


Like
 it
 was
 really
 hard
 when
 you
 asked


me
 about
 my
 mental
 health
 during
 the


treatment.
 I
 couldn't
 answer
 it
 for
 you


initially
 because
 I
 had
 to
 numb
 myself


out
 so
 much
 and
 go
 through
 the
 motions.


I
 was
 still
 caregiving
 for
 my
 son.
 My


partner
 has
 a
 highprofile
 position
 and


you
 know
 they
 still
 had
 to
 work.
 We


couldn't
 find
 a
 caregiver.
 You
 know
 we


were
 patchworking
 things
 but
 it
 made
 it


really
 hard
 on
 my
 son.
 So,
 I
 was
 still


trying
 to
 do
 some
 child
 care
 while
 going


through
 chemo
 and
 radiation
 when
 I


initially
 was
 going
 through
 treatment.


It
 got
 better
 once
 we
 found
 a
 caregiver,


but
 it
 took
 a
 long
 time.


>> Well,
 you
 mentioned
 that
 um
 when
 you


found
 out
 the
 first
 cancer,
 he
 was
 about


to
 turn
 four.


>> Yeah.


>> You're
 celebrating
 his
 life.


>> Mhm.


>> But
 you're
 facing


perhaps


the
 end
 of
 yours.
 How
 do
 you


I'm
 sorry.
 No,
 it
 was
 it
 was
 um
 when
 you


look
 up
 online
 because
 as
 one
 does,
 you


know,
 late
 at
 night,
 you
 know,
 will
 I


die?
 When
 you
 look
 at
 small
 cell
 cancer,


less
 than
 30%
 of
 people,
 they
 say
 0
 to


30%
 of
 people
 live
 with
 it.
 I
 had
 to


come
 to
 terms
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 I
 would


die


because
 I
 didn't
 want
 it
 to
 be
 a
 shock


if
 I
 did.
 I
 did
 my
 will
 right
 away.
 I


made
 decisions.
 You
 know,
 I
 I
 had
 that


all
 set
 up.
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 the


organizer
 in
 me
 was
 like,
 "This
 is


control."
 I
 also
 threw
 a
 party
 for
 my


friends
 to
 tell
 them
 that
 I
 had
 cervical


cancer.
 Um,
 we
 called
 it
 Thank
 You
 for


Your
 Cervix.


>> That's
 pretty
 good.


>> Yeah.
 Thank
 you.
 I
 wanted
 to
 have
 like
 a


cervical
 cake
 with
 ovaries,
 but
 no,
 we


couldn't
 get
 a
 cake
 made.
 I
 was
 really


sad.
 But
 we
 told
 my
 friends
 and
 we
 it


became
 this
 really
 beautiful
 not
 roast


but
 everybody
 you
 know
 took
 turns
 taking


a
 mic
 and
 just
 telling
 me
 that
 they're


going
 to
 be
 there
 for
 me
 and
 we
 actually


brought
 together
 people
 because
 a
 lot
 of


them
 didn't
 know
 each
 other
 and
 we


wanted
 the
 care
 team
 to
 know
 each
 other


so
 that
 they
 also
 could
 support
 each


other
 and
 what
 came
 from
 that
 was
 the


most
 beautiful
 thing.
 It
 came
 over
 35


people
 joined
 um
 like
 a
 care
 website


that
 we
 had
 and
 they
 would
 sign
 up
 for


appointments.
 It
 made
 appointments
 fun.


Initially
 um
 the
 first
 appointment
 I


canled
 the
 person
 coming
 cuz
 I
 said
 I'm


fine.
 You
 don't
 need
 to
 come.
 It's


really
 hard
 to
 take
 yourself
 seriously.


I
 don't
 know
 about
 you
 with
 your
 health,


but
 there
 was
 a
 period
 of
 time
 up
 until


I
 would
 say
 this
 November
 that
 I
 really


believed
 that
 I
 was
 that
 sick.
 Like
 I


was
 so
 about
 caring
 for
 other
 people,


being
 like,
 "It
 can't
 be
 that
 bad,
 and


if
 it
 is,
 I'll
 die."
 Because
 it
 just


felt
 like
 it
 called
 for
 that.
 And
 it
 was


so
 much
 unraveling
 of
 that
 piece.


Have
 you
 thought
 about
 why
 that
 was
 for


you?


>> I'm
 a
 survivor
 of
 child
 sexual
 abuse.


And
 when
 you're
 a
 survivor
 of
 child


sexual
 abuse,
 it's
 very
 different
 than
 a


one-time
 sexual
 assault
 or
 rape
 because


it's
 usually
 by
 someone
 you
 know
 or


love.
 And
 in
 my
 case,
 it
 was
 my


grandfather's.


And
 no
 one
 believed
 me
 initially.
 So


you're
 like
 screaming
 like
 this
 is
 bad.


And
 it
 took
 decades
 for
 people
 to


believe
 me.
 And
 even
 after
 that,
 to
 this


day,
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 understand
 the


scope
 because
 it's
 too
 dangerous
 or
 too


hard
 to
 hear
 what
 they
 are
 implicated
 in


as
 a
 family
 by
 not
 protecting
 me
 when


they
 needed
 to.


And
 so
 I
 think
 little
 me
 when
 I
 said


that
 I
 had
 cancer
 is
 almost
 like
 am
 I


making
 this
 a
 big
 deal
 to
 get
 attention


or
 like
 is
 this
 real?
 Like
 it
 really


feels
 like
 that
 because
 it's
 just
 so


wild.
 And
 it's
 also
 the
 first
 time
 I


think
 cancer
 diagnosis
 compared
 to


anything
 else
 I've
 ever
 had,
 people
 do


believe
 you
 and
 take
 it
 more
 seriously


like
 health
 than
 any
 other
 thing.


>> Why
 do
 you
 think
 that
 is?


>> Because
 it's
 scientific.
 it's
 factual


>> and
 you
 know
 that's
 um
 evidence-based,


you
 know,
 compared
 to
 you
 being
 the


evidence,


you
 know,
 when
 people
 talk
 about
 sexual


violence.
 And
 I
 say
 the
 trauma
 piece


because
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to


understand
 that
 if
 one
 in
 three
 women


have
 been
 impacted


or
 subjected
 to
 some
 form
 of
 violence,


then
 we
 are
 walking
 into
 health
 care


centers,
 many
 of
 us,
 as
 survivors.
 Yet


the
 health
 care
 system
 is
 not
 set
 up
 for


survivors.


That
 took
 my
 breath
 away
 because
 um


immediately
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 think
 of


is


the
 your
 body
 remembers


>> and
 sometimes
 when
 you
 go
 well
 most


times
 when
 you
 go
 into
 a
 doctor's
 office


first
 of
 all
 it's
 one
 one
 person
 with


one
 person.


Um,
 and
 then
 the
 act
 of
 having
 to
 take


off
 your
 clothes
 and
 then
 just
 like
 your


body
 like
 this
 the
 test
 that
 they
 do
 on


women
 like
 you
 you
 know
 this
 might
 sound


a
 little
 graphic
 but
 you
 have
 to
 spread


your
 legs.


>> I
 don't
 think
 it
 is
 graphic
 like
 people


need
 to
 know


>> people
 right
 and
 it's
 again
 it's
 like


there's
 a
 shame
 around
 talking
 about


these
 things
 but
 like
 my
 body
 always


froze.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 some
 doctors
 would
 be
 like
 what's


the
 problem?
 Like
 come
 on.
 And


especially
 when
 you're
 pregnant


>> and
 you
 have
 like
 10
 people
 walking
 into


your
 room,
 sticking
 their
 hands
 up
 your,


>> you
 know,
 vagina
 and
 like
 and
 you


>> Sorry,
 I'm
 like
 ad
 living
 for
 you.
 It's


like
 madness,


>> you
 know,
 right?
 like
 it's
 like
 and
 uh


it's
 hard
 to
 keep
 telling
 saying
 hey
 can


you
 you
 know


>> please
 this
 is
 why
 this
 is
 why
 my
 b
 even


as
 a
 society
 I
 don't
 think
 we're
 ready


to
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 conversations


because
 uh
 then
 it
 forces
 us
 to
 look
 at


the
 things
 that
 are
 in
 the
 corners
 in


the
 dark
 um
 and


>> I
 think
 that's
 a
 bit
 much
 for
 people


even
 just
 talking
 about
 women's
 health


>> oh
 it's
 you
 know
 Yeah,
 if
 I
 talk
 about


breast
 cancer,
 people
 are
 more
 apt
 to


feel
 comfortable
 me
 talking
 about
 it


because
 it's
 your
 breasts
 and
 breasts


don't
 fully
 belong
 to
 you.
 They
 belong


to
 the
 public,
 right?
 They
 belong
 to


men.
 They
 are
 something
 that
 are


cherished
 in
 society.
 Um
 but
 your


vagina,
 your
 cervix,
 your
 ovaries,
 your


fallopian
 tubes,


it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 that's
 too
 graphic,


that's
 too
 much.
 the
 fact
 that
 people


get
 atrophy
 after
 these
 treatments,


radiation,
 chemo,
 internal
 radiation,


um


you
 know,
 they
 cause
 menopause
 in
 me


right
 away
 and
 no
 one
 really
 gives
 you


that
 information.


But
 going
 back
 to
 the
 trauma
 thing,
 I'm


going to
 come
 back
 to
 that
 menopause


thing.
 Um,
 I
 think
 the
 trauma
 piece
 is


really
 important
 to
 understand
 because
 I


had
 to
 consistently
 say,
 "I'm
 a
 trauma


survivor.
 I
 need
 you
 to
 do
 that


differently."
 So,
 for
 example,
 um,
 when


I
 was
 getting
 radiation
 on
 my
 breast,


your
 breast
 is
 completely
 exposed
 and


you're
 in
 a
 room
 with
 two
 people
 and


they
 put
 a
 little
 piece
 of
 paper
 on
 top


of
 it,
 like
 a
 little
 paper
 towel
 that


kind
 of
 sticks.


And
 I
 remember
 the
 technician
 coming
 in


and
 just
 ripping
 it
 off.
 And
 so
 I
 was


exposed
 again.
 And
 I
 burst
 into
 tears.


And
 then
 she
 was
 like,
 "What?"
 And
 I


said,
 "That
 was
 really


uncalled
 for.
 Is
 there
 a
 way
 you
 can
 do


that
 in
 a
 gentle
 way?"
 And
 I
 had
 to
 talk


her
 through
 what
 I
 needed.
 And
 you
 know


what?
 She
 cried
 and
 I
 cried.
 And
 we
 had


this
 beautiful
 conversation
 from
 it


around
 what
 trauma
 informed
 can
 look


like.
 And
 she
 was
 like,
 I've
 been


trained
 in
 this,
 but
 I'm
 not
 practicing


it
 all
 the
 time.
 And
 it
 was
 a
 hard


conversation.
 Um,
 but
 it
 was
 one
 of
 many


that
 I
 had
 during
 this
 process.
 But
 I


felt
 like
 too
 much
 sometimes.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 you
 or
 other
 people
 feel
 that


way,
 but
 I
 felt
 like
 too
 much.
 So
 I'm


like,
 I'm
 a
 trauma
 survivor.
 I'm
 queer.


I'm
 racialized.
 You
 know,
 I
 need
 you
 to


do
 these
 things.
 But
 the
 thing
 is
 is


that
 we're
 not
 fragments
 or
 fractions.


We're
 a
 whole
 person.
 I'm
 not
 a


patchwork
 quilt.


>> I'm
 a
 whole
 person
 and
 I
 need
 you
 to


treat
 me
 with
 the
 care
 that
 I
 deserve.


>> But
 I
 numbed
 out
 a
 lot.
 I
 definitely


used
 the
 skills
 that
 I
 had
 learned
 as
 a


trauma
 survivor,
 as
 a
 child
 sexual
 abuse


survivor
 in
 those
 moments
 to
 just


disassociate


or
 freeze
 or
 numb
 myself
 to
 be
 able
 to


survive.
 The
 amount
 of
 people
 that
 were


consistently
 needing
 to
 do


um
 you
 know,
 they
 failed
 to
 go
 in
 and


look
 at
 my
 vagina,
 look
 at
 my
 cervix.


But
 there
 was
 a
 point
 where
 I
 had
 to
 say


stop.
 Um
 because
 I
 had
 to
 go
 to
 a
 lot
 of


specialists
 to
 get
 help
 on
 different


parts,
 you
 know,
 the
 after
 effects,
 the


little
 small
 things
 that
 happen


afterwards
 that
 they
 would
 say
 which
 in


themselves
 the
 the
 things
 that
 would


happen
 after
 I'm
 sorry,
 my
 brain
 is


getting
 fuzzy.
 You
 know
 the
 thing,


what's
 the
 thing
 that's
 called
 um
 you
 go


for
 treatment
 and
 then
 the
 thing
 that


happens
 after
 it's
 like


>> the
 follow-up
 appointment?


>> No,
 no,
 no,
 no.
 like
 you
 know
 like
 your


primary
 thing
 is
 endometriosis
 but
 the


the
 there's
 something
 that
 happens
 as
 a


result
 of
 getting
 a
 treatment.
 What's


that
 called?


>> This
 is
 my
 brain
 fog.


>> Um


>> he chemobrain
 fog
 is
 real.


>> Yeah.
 We


>> also
 have
 to
 pee
 really
 bad.
 Is
 it
 okay


if
 I
 pee?
 Can
 I
 pee?
 Can
 I
 pee?


>> Listen,
 there
 are
 some
 really
 good


things
 that
 happen
 during
 the
 period.


And
 I
 think
 like


>> like
 what


>> good
 things
 that
 happened?
 Um
 my
 spouse


and
 I
 have
 a
 different
 relationship.


Uh,
 I
 think
 I
 was
 the
 primary
 parent
 of


our
 son,
 you
 know,
 because
 he
 was
 born


right
 before
 the
 pandemic
 and
 then
 just


when
 they're
 little,
 they
 want
 their


mommy,
 you
 know,
 they're
 sorry.
 Yeah.
 We


call
 mama
 and
 mommy,
 but
 you
 know,
 they


want
 they
 want
 one
 parent,
 especially


the
 parent
 that
 that
 breastfeeds
 them


>> because
 we're
 they
 have
 to
 survive.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 They're
 like,
 I
 love


you.
 Give
 me
 food.
 Um,
 and
 I
 breastfed


for
 a
 long
 time.
 And
 uh
 but
 when
 I
 got


sick,
 I
 remember
 my
 partner
 saying
 I
 cuz


I
 send
 them
 away
 when
 I
 would
 have


surgeries
 cuz
 I
 didn't
 want
 my
 son
 to


see
 me
 in
 that
 much
 pain.
 Um
 so
 I
 sent


them
 away,
 which
 is
 heartbreaking,
 too,


cuz
 you're
 they're
 like
 going
 on
 a
 cute


vacation
 and
 you're,
 you
 know,
 not
 um


but
 I
 remember
 my
 spouse
 saying
 to
 me,


"I
 can't
 do
 this.
 Like
 you're
 the
 better


parent,
 you
 know,
 like
 you're
 you're


just
 I
 can't
 do
 this.
 He'll
 want
 you."


and
 they
 went
 away
 together
 and
 my


partner
 said
 to
 me,
 "I
 think
 it's
 okay.


I
 think
 it's
 okay.
 Like,
 he's
 doing


really
 great."
 And
 I'm
 like,
 "You're


doing
 really
 great."
 So,
 there's
 that


piece
 of
 also
 caregiving
 and
 sharing


caregiving
 that
 sometimes
 you
 kind
 of


not
 hoard,
 but
 you're
 kind
 of
 like,
 I


can
 do
 this


>> kind
 of
 hard.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Or
 like
 think


>> you're
 supposed
 to
 do.


>> Yeah.
 Or
 sweep
 in
 to
 kind
 of
 do
 the


thing
 first.
 Um,
 I
 didn't
 know
 that
 I


could
 ask
 for
 help.
 When
 when
 I
 gave


birth
 to
 our
 son,
 I
 didn't
 ask
 for
 help.


I
 was
 in
 the
 hospital,
 you
 know,
 with
 my


spouse,
 but
 no
 one
 else.
 Um,
 I
 didn't


know
 that
 I
 could
 get
 support
 from


friends.
 I
 didn't
 ask
 for
 it.
 And
 then


the
 pandemic
 happened
 and
 we
 were
 really


isolated.


to
 have
 that
 celebration,
 the
 thank
 you


for
 your
 cervix
 celebration,
 bring


together
 people
 we
 love
 and
 be
 able
 to


say,
 I
 have
 this
 cancer


that's
 very
 rare
 and
 very
 serious.
 Can


you
 help
 me?


It
 was
 kind
 of
 I
 was
 kind
 of
 h
 I
 was
 no


kind
 of
 I
 was
 humbled
 humbled
 because


people
 just
 showed
 up.
 I
 had
 people
 I've


helped
 out
 in
 other
 parts
 of
 my
 life.
 um


reach
 out
 online
 when
 I
 couldn't
 get
 the


medication
 the
 day
 before
 I
 had
 to
 do


chemo
 and
 I
 was
 too
 weak
 to
 go
 walk


there
 cuz
 I
 live
 so
 close
 to
 one
 of
 the


hospitals
 I
 can
 walk
 to
 it
 which
 I


probably
 shouldn't
 have
 during
 chemo
 but


I
 was
 like
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 walk
 back


and
 forth


>> I
 can
 do
 it.


>> Yeah,
 totally.
 That
 mindset
 of


ridiculousness.
 Um
 and
 they
 went
 to
 go


get
 my
 medication.
 So,
 this
 is
 someone
 I


never
 met
 before,
 but
 I
 had
 helped
 their


partner
 and
 they
 said,
 "Oh,
 yeah.
 We


live
 right
 by
 you.
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 get


your
 meds
 and
 I'll
 drop
 them
 off
 at
 your


concagege."


>> That's
 really
 lovely
 to
 hear
 because
 I


think
 people
 want
 to
 help,
 but
 if
 you


don't
 ask,
 they
 maybe
 assume
 you
 don't


want
 to
 help
 or
 need
 the
 help.
 Um,
 but


you
 know,
 motherhood
 for
 me,
 uh,
 I


learned
 so
 much
 about
 myself


because
 I
 I
 always
 say
 to,
 um,
 like


motherhood
 is
 very
 humbling


in
 so
 many
 ways.
 Um,
 but
 you
 wanted
 to


have
 another
 baby.
 How
 did
 you
 navigate


that
 loss
 of
 not
 being
 able
 to
 have


another
 baby
 after
 your
 cancer


diagnosis?


>> I'm
 still
 navigating
 it.


it
 uh
 it's
 such
 a
 deep
 well
 of
 grief.


>> I
 wonder
 if
 I
 was
 straight
 they
 would


have
 talked
 to
 me
 more
 about
 it.
 So


usually
 when
 or
 a
 protocol
 is
 that
 when


you
 have
 the
 type
 of
 cancer
 that
 I
 do


and
 going
 through
 that
 kind
 of
 treatment


they
 tell
 you
 about
 your
 options.


I
 had
 luckily
 saved
 a
 number
 of


um
 embryos
 that
 we
 had
 because
 we
 had


gone
 through
 IVF
 initially.
 Um
 and
 we


had
 saved
 like
 eight,
 eight
 or
 nine.
 And


so
 I
 had
 them,


but
 I
 had
 thought
 that
 I
 was
 going
 to
 be


pregnant
 again.
 That
 was
 that
 was
 my


goal.
 I
 wanted
 to
 have
 another
 baby.


And
 uh
 it
 didn't
 sink
 in
 and
 I
 didn't


let
 it
 sink
 in
 like
 I
 kept
 those
 embryos


because
 I
 was
 like
 maybe
 surrogacy
 or
 I


don't know
 a
 friend
 will
 carry
 for
 me.


Um
 but
 I
 think
 it
 sunk
 in
 the
 day
 that
 I


went
 to
 my
 you
 know
 radiation
 oncologist


and
 I
 was
 like
 oh
 yeah
 so
 what's


happening
 with
 my
 period?
 Is
 it
 going
 to


stop
 for
 a
 little
 bit
 during
 this


radiation?
 And
 she
 just
 looked
 at
 me
 and


point
 blankly
 said,
 "No,
 your
 ovaries


are
 dead."


Okay.


And
 no
 one
 had
 really
 prepared
 me
 for


that.
 Like
 they
 had
 said
 that
 I
 wouldn't


be
 able
 to
 have
 like
 carry
 a
 child.
 Um


but
 I
 didn't
 realize
 that
 what
 was


happening.
 I
 think
 you
 just
 they
 move


you
 so
 quickly
 at
 that
 time.
 They
 give


you
 some
 pamphlets,
 but
 they
 move
 you
 so


quickly
 because
 the
 type
 of
 cancer
 I
 had


was
 so
 aggressive.
 Like,
 we
 only
 found


out
 that
 I
 had
 breast
 cancer
 through
 a


scan.


Um,
 and


the
 doctors
 were
 like,
 "Oh,
 no."
 Like,


this
 is
 just
 a
 benign
 thing.
 Don't
 worry


about
 it.
 And
 when
 my
 one
 of
 my
 doctors


called
 me
 to
 check
 in
 about
 the
 next


radiation
 appointment
 I
 had,


I
 was
 looking
 at
 the
 biopsy
 results
 and


I
 said
 to
 her,
 "It
 looks
 like
 I
 I
 do


have
 breast
 cancer."


>> Wait,
 so
 you're
 the
 one
 that
 pointed
 out


that


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Because
 you
 you
 get
 this
 new


system
 is
 that
 you
 get
 your
 results
 at


this,
 you
 know.


>> And
 she
 was
 like, "Oh,
 no,
 you
 don't."


And
 then
 I
 said,
 "Well,
 no,
 look,
 the


biopsy
 results
 came
 in."
 And
 then
 we're


on
 the
 phone
 as
 this
 is
 happening.
 And


she
 she
 goes,
 "Okay,
 just
 give
 me
 a


sec."
 She
 looks
 at
 them
 and
 she
 goes,


"Oh,
 yeah,
 you
 do
 have
 breast
 cancer."


And
 that's
 how
 it
 was
 confirmed
 to
 me


that
 I
 had
 breast
 cancer
 from
 a
 doctor.


>> And
 how
 soon
 after
 you
 found
 out
 you
 had


cervical
 cancer?


>> A
 month.


It's
 about
 2%
 of
 people
 with
 cancer
 get


a
 second
 cancer.


It
 is
 extremely
 extremely
 rare
 to
 get
 a


second
 cancer
 during
 your
 treatment
 for


first
 cancer.


>> And
 you're
 fairly
 young


>> when
 we're
 seeing
 more
 young
 people


being
 diagnosed
 with
 cancer.


>> I
 imagine
 that
 probably
 also
 created
 an


additional
 barrier
 because
 of
 being


dismissed.
 You're
 too
 young
 to
 have


this.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Like
 I
 when
 I
 initially
 in


January
 of
 2023,


I
 woke
 up
 one
 day
 and
 I
 said
 to
 my


partner,
 "I
 have
 breast
 cancer.
 I
 think


I
 have
 breast
 cancer."
 And
 it
 wasn't


because
 I
 had
 a
 lump
 or
 anything.
 It
 was


just
 a
 feeling,
 which
 I
 know
 seems


strange
 to
 some
 people,
 but
 I
 don't


know,
 trusting
 my
 feelings
 has
 worked


for
 me
 before.
 When
 I
 went
 to
 my
 doctor,


um,
 when
 I
 initially
 had
 the
 the


cervical


test
 or
 the
 cervical
 scrape,
 um,
 I
 said,


you
 know,
 I
 think
 I
 also
 have
 I
 think
 I


have
 breast
 cancer.
 And
 she
 was
 like


felt
 my
 breast,
 like
 did
 a
 exam
 and
 she


was
 like,
 no,
 there's
 no
 lymphs.
 You


don't
 need
 to
 go
 get
 a
 mammogram.


And
 so
 I
 didn't
 go
 for
 a
 mamogram.
 The


only
 way
 they
 caught
 it
 was
 because
 I


had
 to
 go
 for
 further
 scans
 for
 my


cervical
 cancer.
 and
 I
 was
 43
 at
 the


time.
 It
 is
 young
 and
 that
 makes
 it
 even


more
 difficult.
 One
 that
 people


oftentimes
 don't
 take
 you
 seriously,


but
 you're
 too
 old
 to
 be
 in
 the
 young


people
 cancer
 group
 and
 you're
 too
 young


to
 be
 with
 the
 seniors.
 But
 I
 was


oftentimes
 put
 in
 programs
 where
 it
 was


mostly
 seniors
 and
 that
 created
 a
 mental


health
 challenge
 for
 me.
 Not
 because
 I


don't
 love
 seniors.
 They're
 amazing
 and


oftentimes
 put
 me
 in
 my
 place
 in
 a


really
 good
 way.
 Um,
 great
 advice
 around


how
 to
 deal
 with
 the
 arthritis
 that
 came


into
 my
 hands


um
 and
 the
 pain
 that
 went
 through
 my


hips
 from
 all
 the
 treatment.
 Uh,
 but
 it


was
 hard
 because
 they
 had
 retired


whereas
 I
 was
 facing
 this
 moment
 of
 will


I
 be
 able
 to
 go
 back
 to
 work?
 I
 had


already
 missed
 a
 year.
 Not
 missed
 a


year.
 Well,
 I
 was
 with
 my
 son,
 but
 it


felt
 like
 missing
 a
 year
 in
 terms
 of
 the


way
 that
 the
 work
 world
 works.


>> Of
 course,
 you
 missed
 a
 year
 in
 the
 work


world.
 I
 think
 sometimes
 we
 sugarcoat


these
 things
 and
 it's
 like
 if
 you're
 not


there,
 you
 are
 missing.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 you
 can't
 be
 in
 two
 places
 at
 the


same
 time.


>> No,
 but
 there's
 such
 a
 penalty
 for
 that.


The
 motherhood
 penalty
 is
 real.


>> And
 then
 two
 years
 later,
 I
 get
 cancer.


The
 other
 part
 about
 what
 you
 were
 just


saying
 about
 the
 seniors,
 I
 think
 if


you're
 treated
 in
 that
 group
 too,
 you


still
 how
 you
 wanted
 to
 still
 become


have
 another
 baby,
 but
 if
 you're
 in
 that


senior
 category,
 oh,
 you
 already
 wrapped


that
 part
 of
 your
 life
 up
 and
 maybe
 they


treat
 you
 differently
 because
 of
 that.


>> Um,
 I
 didn't
 feel
 they
 were
 treating
 me


differently
 in
 that
 way.
 Like
 ev
 every


time
 I
 would
 go
 for
 scans,
 so
 MRIs,
 CTS,


they
 would
 ask
 me
 if
 I
 was
 pregnant.


Even
 though
 it
 said
 cervical
 cancer
 on,


I
 wanted
 to
 make
 a
 pin
 and
 it
 felt
 like


a
 it
 felt
 like
 a
 punch
 in
 the
 gut
 every


time.
 Sometimes
 I
 would
 just
 weep
 on
 the


MRI
 table.


>> Did
 you
 always
 want
 to
 become
 a
 mother?


>> Yes.


>> How
 come?


>> Yeah.


>> I
 always


wanted
 to
 be
 a
 mother.


I
 always
 wanted
 that.


And
 when
 you're
 queer,


you're
 constantly
 told
 that


in
 so
 many
 ways
 that
 you
 shouldn't
 be
 a


mother.
 The
 way
 in
 which
 people
 talk


about
 queer
 people
 as
 deviants,


as
 a
 problem
 to
 be
 solved,


as
 something
 to
 fix.
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 a


Muslim
 Catholic
 family,
 so
 guilt
 was
 big


around
 sexuality,
 both
 sides.
 And
 uh


I
 didn't
 grow
 up
 with
 support
 when
 I
 was


first
 coming
 out.
 It's
 changed
 in
 some


ways
 and
 other
 ways
 it
 hasn't.
 I
 was


disowned
 by
 half
 my
 family
 when
 I
 chose


to
 marry
 my
 spouse
 who's
 wonderful.


They're
 missing
 out,
 of
 course.


It
 was
 really
 isolating.
 So,
 I
 always


wanted
 to
 be
 a
 mother.
 I
 always
 wanted


to,
 but
 there's
 so
 many
 barriers,


including
 price.
 Like,
 it's
 so
 expensive


to
 go
 through
 the
 IVF
 process.
 You
 know,


the
 cost
 of
 sperm,
 the
 cost
 of
 um


getting
 all
 the
 tests
 to
 see
 if
 you
 can


get
 pregnant
 than
 to
 the
 private


clinics,
 the
 the
 process
 is
 extremely


also
 invasive.


So,
 it
 also
 taught
 me
 how
 to
 numb
 myself


out
 and
 disassociate
 to
 say
 it
 wasn't


painful
 to
 say,
 "Oh,
 it's
 fine.
 I
 don't


I
 don't
 need
 medication.
 I
 can
 do
 that."


>> Because
 it's
 something
 that
 you
 really


wanted.
 And
 um
 you
 know,
 one
 cancer


diagnosis
 is
 devastating,
 but
 two,
 I


think,
 would
 destroy
 anyone.
 Um
 on


social
 media
 though,
 uh
 you
 created


memes
 that
 documented
 what
 you
 were


experiencing,
 but
 these
 memes
 also
 made


people
 laugh.
 I
 think
 I
 messaged
 you
 a


few
 times
 and
 said,
 "Wow,
 um
 this
 like


you
 know,
 um
 in
 the
 process
 of
 you


losing
 so
 much,
 you
 were
 giving
 joy
 to


other
 people.
 How
 come?"


>> It
 was
 giving
 joy
 to
 me.
 Like
 I
 had
 to


laugh
 sometimes
 cuz
 it's
 just
 it
 was
 so


ridiculous.
 And
 you
 haven't
 seen
 all
 the


memes.
 I
 didn't
 even
 unleash
 the
 memes.


One
 thing
 literally
 in


>> maybe
 a
 meme
 book
 afterward


>> maybe
 maybe
 like
 a
 burn
 book.
 Um,
 my


spouse
 like
 in
 my
 instructions
 to
 them


if
 I
 had
 died
 was
 to
 release
 all
 the


memes.


Like
 it
 was
 not
 a
 joke
 in
 our
 house
 and


they
 knew
 that
 if
 I
 was
 going
 to
 die


that
 there
 had
 to
 be
 a
 roast.
 Like
 it


could
 not
 be
 like
 a
 regular
 regular


thing
 where
 people
 were
 like,
 "Oh,
 she


was
 so
 lovely.
 No,
 I
 want
 people
 to


roast
 me."
 And
 and
 that
 was
 really
 a


part
 of
 this
 that
 I
 had
 to
 have
 joy


throughout
 it.
 I
 would
 make
 jokes
 to,


you
 know,
 with
 the
 doctors,
 you
 know,


there
 were
 funny
 moments
 with
 this
 like


um


my
 spouse
 was
 with
 me
 uh
 at
 one
 of
 the


appointments
 before
 I
 started
 chemo
 and


the
 doctor
 I
 said
 to
 them,
 you
 know,
 is


there
 anything
 else
 I
 need
 to
 know?
 And


you
 know,
 he
 thought
 for
 a
 second,
 he's


like,
 oh
 yeah,
 you
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 you


use
 birth
 control
 during
 chemo.
 And
 I


looked
 at
 my
 partner
 and
 I
 looked
 at
 the


resident
 who
 was
 obviously
 queer
 as


well.
 And
 I
 just
 looked
 at
 the
 doctor.
 I


said,
 "I'm
 gay."
 Gay.
 And
 he
 with


>> a
 capital
 G.


>> Yeah.
 A
 capital
 G,
 a
 hard
 G
 there.
 And


he
 looked
 at
 me
 and
 he
 was
 like,
 "Yeah,


so
 maybe
 not
 that."
 You
 know,
 and
 so


like
 it
 was
 just
 it
 was
 funny
 at
 that


moment.
 And
 you
 have
 to
 laugh,
 you
 know?


You
 have
 to
 find
 humor
 in
 it.
 And
 it's


the
 same
 as
 the
 thing
 like
 uh
 these


things
 are
 always
 going
 to
 be
 funny
 to


me.
 I
 have
 to
 laugh
 even
 like
 just


recently
 I
 had
 a
 test
 at
 a
 hospital
 and


they're
 like
 okay
 get
 changed
 into
 this


you
 know
 get
 changed
 and
 then
 we'll
 do


the
 procedure
 and
 they
 left
 and
 they
 had


locked
 all
 the
 robes
 in
 a
 glass
 cabinet


so
 I
 couldn't
 get
 changed.
 And
 I
 was


like
 oh
 well
 I
 need
 to
 get
 ready.
 So,
 I


just
 took
 a
 sheet,
 wrapped
 around
 my


naked
 body,
 and
 then
 was
 ready
 to
 go.


And
 the
 doctor
 came
 back
 and
 he
 was


like,
 "Okay,
 go
 use
 this
 robe.
 Let
 me


get
 this
 out."
 But
 I
 was
 just
 like, "All


right."
 It
 was
 like,
 you
 know,
 the
 jetu


holidays
 like
 I
 was
 jet
 holiday
 at
 that


moment.
 I
 was
 like,
 nothing
 can
 be
 like


discount
 hospital
 time.
 Like
 you
 just


like
 I
 don't
 know.
 Or
 like


>> life
 continues.


>> Life
 continues
 like
 you
 know.
 Um,
 I
 love


Issa
 Ray,
 who
 of
 course
 is
 from
 um,


Insecure.
 And
 she,
 her
 first
 episode
 of


Insecure,
 she
 makes
 a
 rap
 song
 about
 her


friend
 called
 Broken
 And
 I
 swear


I
 played
 that
 all
 the
 time
 because
 mine


was
 so
 broken.
 And
 I
 would
 play
 that
 for


everybody.
 I'd
 be
 like,
 "This
 is
 our


song
 before
 we
 start
 chemo."
 Like,
 I
 was


just
 like
 marching
 around
 like
 that
 was


my
 jam.
 And
 it
 was.
 And
 so,
 like,
 yeah,


parts
 of
 you
 are
 broken,
 but
 you
 have
 to


find
 ways
 to
 bring
 them.
 And
 I
 refuse
 to


just
 be
 broken
 because
 there's
 a


narrative
 of
 what
 we're
 supposed
 to
 be.


But
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 that
 that
 worked
 for


only
 a
 year.
 It
 worked
 for
 only
 a
 year


because
 I
 had
 it
 in
 my
 mind
 that
 I
 could


do
 a
 twoin-
 one.
 I
 could
 do
 breast


cancer
 and
 cervical
 cancer
 treatment,


small
 cell,
 rare
 cervical
 cancer


treatment,
 all
 in
 one
 year.
 So
 I
 pushed


the
 doctors
 after
 I
 was
 done
 six
 months


of
 intensive
 treatment
 like
 so
 much


chemo,
 so
 many
 invasive


um
 surgeries.
 Uh


and
 then


I
 remember
 calling
 him
 in
 December.
 So
 I


was
 just
 done
 chemo
 and
 all
 the


treatment
 for
 cerv
 small
 cell
 cervical


and
 I
 was
 like
 okay
 I'm
 ready
 for
 my


breast
 cancer
 treatment.
 How
 soon
 can
 we


do
 it?
 And
 they're
 like
 uh
 let's
 wait


until
 January.
 And
 I
 was
 upset
 at
 that


time
 because
 I
 wanted
 to
 get
 it
 done


because
 I
 wanted
 to
 go
 back
 to
 work.


>> I
 mean,
 the
 work
 culture
 we
 live
 in,
 uh,


it's,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 you've
 been
 so


generous
 with
 our
 conversation
 and,
 um,


we're
 running
 out
 of
 time
 and,
 uh,
 you
 I


think
 this
 could
 be
 like
 a
 whole
 other


episode
 about
 where
 when
 you're


navigating
 an
 illness,
 but
 you
 still


have
 to
 show
 up
 at
 work,
 uh,
 in
 your


family.
 And
 you
 mentioned
 that
 you
 wrote


a
 column
 for
 the
 Global
 Mail
 and
 I
 just


wanted
 to
 read
 part
 of
 what
 you
 wrote.


You
 wrote,
 "Before
 cancer,
 I
 had
 walked


the
 edges
 of
 grief.
 It
 was
 something
 I


didn't
 fully
 allow
 myself
 to
 feel.


Always
 too
 sharp,
 too
 raw
 to
 touch.


Navigating
 these
 illnesses
 has
 allowed


me
 to
 befriend
 grief.
 I
 sit
 within
 it


preparing
 for
 the
 waves
 so
 I
 can
 ride


them."
 What
 have
 you
 learned
 about
 grief


that
 has
 changed
 your
 relationship
 with


it?


>> Yeah,
 I've
 learned
 to
 actually
 feel
 it.


I
 think
 before


before


it
 was
 inconvenient


with
 cancer
 I
 couldn't
 work
 during


cancer
 so
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 I
 was
 left


with
 myself


my
 friends
 called
 it
 micro
 doing


capitalism
 for
 me
 sometimes
 they
 would


like
 give
 me
 little
 projects
 to
 do
 so


that
 I
 would
 not
 be
 fanatic


um
 but
 I
 had
 to
 sit
 with
 my
 grief
 and


grief
 that


grief
 that
 I
 hadn't
 processed
 from
 other


things
 that
 were
 connected
 to
 cancer.
 So


my
 father
 when
 he
 died
 of
 pancreatic


cancer
 because
 I
 was
 disowned
 that
 whole


side
 of
 the
 family


um
 didn't
 talk
 to
 me
 and
 you
 know
 I


don't
 know
 where
 he's
 buried.
 I
 don't


know.


I
 don't
 know
 much.


But
 the
 grief
 came
 during
 that
 time


because
 during
 cancer
 because
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 I
 was
 being
 asked
 about
 my


genetics
 because
 pancreatic
 cancer
 um
 if


you
 have
 it
 um
 and
 you
 have
 a
 family


member
 with
 ovarian
 there's
 a
 connection


also
 to
 breast
 cancer
 bracka
 1.


And
 so
 I
 was
 getting
 genetic
 testing
 and


I
 didn't
 know
 the
 history
 of
 my
 family.


And
 that's
 homophobia


meeting
 up
 with
 the
 medical
 system.


And
 I
 had
 to
 grieve
 that
 loss
 of
 my


whole
 side
 of
 a
 family


during
 cancer
 treatment
 because
 I
 hadn't


touched
 that
 yet.
 I
 hadn't
 touched
 that.


or
 the
 grief
 of
 not
 being
 able
 to
 have


another
 child
 and
 the
 homophobia
 that
 we


experienced
 as
 a
 family
 while
 I
 was


pregnant.
 People
 commenting
 on
 our
 news


that
 I
 was
 pregnant
 saying
 that
 it
 was


abomination


that
 um
 our
 child
 shouldn't
 exist
 and


our
 child
 should
 exist.
 our
 son
 is
 so


joyful,
 so
 wonderful.


>> And
 seeing
 that
 grief
 is
 a
 part
 of
 my


life
 and
 that
 cancer's
 taught
 me
 to
 not,


as
 I
 said,
 sit
 in
 the
 edges
 of
 it
 or


walk
 the
 edges
 of
 it,
 but
 to
 actually


live
 through
 it
 and
 that
 I
 can't


separate
 it.


>> What
 have
 you
 learned
 about
 yourself


through
 these
 processes?


I
 learned
 that
 I
 can't
 control
 anything


and
 that
 death
 might
 come.
 I
 became


comfortable
 with
 death
 and
 grief
 around


that.


What
 I
 learned
 about
 myself
 too
 was
 that


wow,
 I
 like
 to
 people
 please.
 So
 I
 had


to
 work
 through
 a
 lot
 of
 wanting
 to
 make


other
 people
 feel
 comfortable
 like


doctors
 even
 and
 that
 I
 could
 be
 present


in
 my
 body.
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 was
 that


present
 in
 my
 body
 before
 because
 to


survive
 what
 I
 survived,
 I
 had
 to


disassociate.
 And
 then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


when
 you're
 healing,
 people
 are
 like,


"Oh,
 does
 this
 hurt
 here?
 Where
 is
 the


pain?"
 And
 you're
 like, "I
 don't
 know.
 I


don't
 know
 how
 to
 tell
 you
 that.
 You


want
 me
 to
 start
 with
 grief?"
 If
 I
 start


talking
 about
 grief,
 it's
 like
 pulling
 a


thread
 and
 everything
 opening,


unraveling.


But
 I
 had
 to
 let
 that
 unravel
 because
 I


want
 to
 live
 whole.
 I
 want
 to
 live
 like


I'm
 alive.
 And
 um
 Audrey
 Lord,
 who's
 a


survivor
 of
 cancer,
 was
 a
 survivor
 of


cancer
 and
 a
 black
 feminist
 poet
 and


writer
 and
 everything.
 She
 talked
 about


wanting
 to
 live
 her
 life
 like
 a
 comet,


you
 know,
 and
 I
 took
 her
 words
 so
 deeply


when
 I
 was
 going
 through
 my
 treatment,


wanting
 to
 live
 life
 fully,
 but
 learning


that
 I
 have
 to
 move
 slowly,
 that
 I
 don't


move
 at
 other
 people's
 pace
 of
 healing


or
 pace
 of
 healing.
 I
 move
 at
 my
 own
 and


no
 one
 gets
 to
 shape
 that
 but
 me.


I
 really
 struggled
 with
 friendship


during
 cancer.
 I
 could
 have
 friends
 uh


my
 care
 team
 was
 amazing
 but
 not
 many


people
 could
 understand
 what
 I
 was
 going


through.
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 make
 friends


with
 people
 with
 cancer
 because
 often
 if


I
 did
 when
 they
 started
 talking
 about


their
 treatment
 it
 wasn't
 the
 same
 as


mine
 especially
 as
 someone
 with
 two


cancers
 and
 one
 being
 very
 rare
 and


aggressive.


I
 ended
 up
 making
 two
 friends
 during
 my


treatment.
 One,
 a
 woman
 that
 was
 much


older
 than
 me
 on
 her
 second
 battle
 with


cancer
 battle
 second
 cancer
 treatment


process
 and
 another
 woman
 who
 was
 around


my
 age
 with
 two
 young
 children.


both
 died
 um


a
 one
 after
 another
 just
 uh
 in
 June
 and


July.
 Their
 funerals
 back
 toback


literally
 a
 Friday
 and
 a
 Saturday


and
 then
 just
 this
 Saturday
 my


father-in-law
 passed
 away.


So
 how
 am
 I
 doing?


There
 was
 times
 during
 my
 treatment
 that


I
 wanted
 to
 die.


There
 was
 treatment
 plans
 that
 weren't


expected.
 There
 were
 times
 where
 I
 just


thought,
 "Oh,
 yeah.
 This
 is
 done."
 And


then
 a
 new
 thing
 would
 pop
 up.
 And
 so


many
 people
 at
 first
 want
 you
 to
 be


alive.
 So
 they're
 like, "You're
 going
 to


be
 fine."
 And
 I
 kind
 of
 was
 like, "Yeah,


of
 course."
 And
 after
 a
 while,
 I
 started


saying,
 "Maybe
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be


fine."


And
 it's
 getting
 comfortable
 with
 all


those
 things.


But
 this
 friend,
 my
 my
 sister
 who
 was
 my


around
 my
 age,
 Sheila
 Cola,


she
 wanted
 to
 live
 every
 day.
 She
 wanted


to
 live
 and
 I
 was
 the
 chromagin
 out
 of


the
 two
 of
 us.


But
 now
 that
 she's
 gone,


I
 want
 to
 carry
 her
 with
 me.
 So,
 how
 am


I
 doing?
 I'm
 alive.
 And
 that's
 so


different
 than
 so
 many
 people
 in
 my


life.
 All
 the
 people
 that
 were
 closest


to
 me
 have
 died.


um
 that
 all
 the
 people
 closest
 to
 me
 who


had
 cancer
 are
 dead


in
 the
 past
 three
 months.


So,
 I'm
 here


and
 I'm
 trying
 and
 I'm
 alive.
 I'm
 going


back
 to
 work,
 whatever
 that
 looks
 like.


I'm
 holding
 my
 son's
 hand
 in
 the
 sun.


I
 get
 to
 cuddle
 with
 him
 as
 he
 makes


potions.
 Just
 recently,
 he
 made
 a


potion.
 Um
 and
 I
 asked
 him,
 you
 know,


what's
 what's
 this
 new
 one?
 And
 he
 said,


"It's
 the
 don't
 die
 potion,
 and
 if
 you


spray
 it
 on
 someone,
 they
 won't
 die.


It's
 not
 just
 me
 who
 processed
 this


whole
 couple
 years.
 It
 was
 him,
 too.
 And


watching
 him
 grieve
 his
 grandfather


and
 process
 death
 and
 talk
 about
 it
 has


made
 me
 want
 to
 live
 more
 because
 I
 want


to
 be
 able
 to
 keep
 talking
 to
 him
 about


those
 things.
 I
 want
 to
 hold
 my
 spouse's


hand.
 I
 want
 to
 slow
 dance
 with
 them.


But
 how
 am
 I
 doing
 right
 now?


I'm
 clear
 scans
 for
 the
 first
 time,


which
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 to
 do
 with.


I'm
 waiting
 for
 the
 other
 shoe
 to
 drop


when
 I
 get
 excited
 about
 life
 again.
 On


the
 other
 hand,
 I'm
 excited
 about
 life.


So,
 how
 am
 I
 doing?
 I'm
 alive.


>> Just
 one
 more
 question.
 Thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 sharing
 that.


What
 do
 you
 think
 is
 missing
 in
 the


health
 care
 system
 that
 could
 have
 made


what
 you
 went
 through
 a
 little
 bit


easier
 to
 manage?


>> Just
 one
 thing.


>> Well,
 you
 know,


>> just
 one
 thing.
 Um,


>> first
 of
 all,
 our
 health
 care
 system
 in


Ontario
 and
 across
 Canada
 is
 being


defunded.
 I'm
 watching
 that
 firsthand.
 I


had
 a
 surgery
 that
 was
 supposed
 to


happen
 to
 remove
 my
 ovaries
 and
 I
 was


there
 Ivy
 was
 in
 hadn't
 eaten
 24
 hours


and
 I
 was
 sitting
 in
 the
 waiting
 area


you
 know
 that
 chase
 lounge
 chess
 lounge


that
 you
 sit
 in
 no
 the
 recliner
 that
 you


sit
 in
 um
 and
 my
 doctor
 had
 to
 come
 over


to
 me
 and
 said
 you
 know
 what
 we
 don't


have
 enough
 nurses
 we
 can't
 we
 can't


have
 the
 surgery
 you're
 going to
 have
 to


come
 back
 in
 a
 couple
 days
 and
 that
 is
 a


direct
 example
 an
 impact
 of
 the


defunding
 of
 our
 health
 care
 system.
 So


there
 are
 so
 many
 things
 that
 need
 to


happen
 around
 trauma-informed
 care,


around
 anti-racism
 in
 our
 health
 care


and
 understanding
 from
 an
 inter


intersectional
 place
 that
 when
 a
 woman


comes
 through
 those
 doors
 of
 a
 health


care
 system,
 be
 it
 a
 hospital,
 a
 clinic,


they
 deserve
 care
 that
 meets
 their


needs.
 not
 the
 needs
 that
 is
 being


prescribed
 to
 them
 but
 their
 needs
 and


traumaformed
 care
 should
 just
 be
 across


the
 board
 because
 let's
 just
 respect.


So
 what
 needs
 to
 happen?
 We
 need
 our


health
 care
 system
 not
 to
 be
 defunded


but
 actually
 the
 money
 to
 be
 increased


envelope
 by
 envelope.
 We
 need
 women's


health
 care
 to
 be
 taken
 seriously.
 We


know
 that
 women
 that
 are
 women
 do
 women


that
 are
 doctors
 are
 paid
 less.


We
 know
 that
 if
 you
 do
 surgeries
 on


women
 for
 the
 same
 equivalent
 of
 for


men,
 they
 are
 paid
 less.
 And
 not
 just


like,
 you
 know,
 1%
 2%
 like
 20
 over
 20%.


We
 know
 that
 so
 many
 people
 don't
 have
 a


primary
 healthcare
 doctor.
 So
 I
 was


lucky
 enough
 to
 have
 a
 primary


healthcare
 doctor
 that
 could
 test
 me


every
 year
 to
 see
 if
 cervical
 cancer
 had


appeared


and
 check
 me
 for
 HPV.


We
 don't
 have
 that
 yet.
 And
 if
 you
 want


to
 do
 home
 care
 tests
 now
 for
 HPV,
 you


have
 to
 pay,
 which
 is
 out
 of
 reach
 for


so
 many
 people.
 We
 haven't
 even
 talked


about
 the
 cost
 of
 cancer.
 You
 know,


cancer
 patients
 pay
 up
 to
 $33,000


when
 they're
 going
 through
 cancer


treatment.
 The
 amount
 of
 money
 that
 went


out
 of
 pocket
 to
 pay
 for
 things
 that


were
 not
 covered
 by
 OHIP
 or
 my
 benefits,


having
 to
 fight
 with
 my
 insurance


company
 all
 the
 time.
 So,
 it's
 this


system.
 It's
 not
 one
 thing
 because
 it


impacts
 so
 many
 things
 impact
 us.
 And
 if


we're
 not
 investing
 in
 the
 system
 in


public
 health
 care
 and
 not
 the
 scraps,


but
 actual
 public
 health
 care
 that
 meets


everybody's
 needs,
 we're
 going
 to


continue
 to
 see
 people
 have
 cervical


cancer,
 which
 is
 completely
 preventable.


Completely
 preventable.
 I
 think
 that's


what
 thing
 that
 makes
 me
 want
 to
 flip
 a


table,
 throw
 a
 chair,


is
 that
 this
 is
 preventable.
 and
 people


did
 not
 invest
 in
 this,
 I
 wouldn't
 I


would
 have
 had
 more
 children.
 I
 would


have
 been
 in
 my
 job
 thriving.


But
 because
 there
 was
 a
 deinvestment
 in


public
 health
 care,
 people
 like
 me
 have


to
 go
 through
 this.
 And
 so
 I
 would
 like


this
 to
 be
 history,
 cervical
 cancer.
 I


would
 also
 want
 our
 healthcare
 system
 to


continue
 to
 be
 public
 and
 not


fragmented.


So
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 magic
 wand
 and
 I
 have


a
 big
 answer
 for
 you.


>> I
 think
 that's
 you
 know
 we
 can't
 uh
 I


think
 maybe
 that's
 the
 problem.
 We
 look


at
 one
 thing
 when
 it's
 a
 systemic
 thing.


Far,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Appreciate
 it.

 Here's
 a
 comment


we
 got
 on
 YouTube
 from
 our
 pain
 and


pregnancy
 episode.
 The
 health
 and


well-being
 of
 the
 woman
 must
 always
 be
 a


priority.
 Women
 should
 not
 suffer
 pain,


fever,
 disease
 because
 they
 are


pregnant.
 We
 need
 to
 include
 pregnant


women
 in
 well-
 reggulated
 scientific


drug
 trials.
 Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 that


comment.
