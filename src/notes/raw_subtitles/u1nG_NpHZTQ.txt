as
 it
 happens.
 The
 Bloomberg
 Business


Week
 Daily
 podcast
 with
 Carol
 Masser
 and


Tim
 Stenbec
 on
 Bloomberg
 Radio.
 One


group
 that
 has
 done
 uh
 really
 well
 today


as
 a
 whole,
 we're
 talking
 about
 big


banks
 or
 banks
 overall,
 the
 KBW
 bank


index,
 folks,
 up
 2.3%,
 22
 of
 the
 24


names
 are
 higher
 in
 today's
 session.


We've
 had


>> two
 big
 ones
 lower.
 Two
 of
 the
 big
 ones


are
 lower.
 Two
 of
 the
 biggest
 names
 on


the
 entire
 index
 are
 lower.
 Well,
 this


is
 what's
 interesting
 because
 JP
 Morgan,


Goldman,
 Wells
 City,
 all
 reporting
 JP


Morgan
 and
 Goldman
 selling
 off,
 right?


And
 those
 are
 the
 two
 names
 you're


talking
 about
 and
 Wells
 and
 City
 Matt


are
 are
 in.


>> I
 mean,
 and
 you
 get
 headlines
 like
 JP


Morgan
 beats
 expectations
 on
 every


level.
 Goldman
 Sachs
 knocks
 the
 cover


off
 the
 ball.
 Analysts
 can't
 believe
 how


well
 they
 did
 and
 yet
 the
 stocks
 sell


off.


>> But
 remember,
 something
 like
 JP
 Morgan


has
 had
 quite
 a
 run
 this
 year.
 So,
 you


know,
 expectations
 and
 reality
 perhaps.


Let's
 see
 what
 our
 experts
 have
 to
 say.


Bloomberg
 News
 chief
 Wall
 Street


correspondent
 Shinat
 Rajan's
 here
 in


studio
 along
 with
 Bloomberg


Intelligence,
 senior
 analyst
 for
 Global


Investment
 Banks
 and
 Asset
 Managers,


Allison
 Williams.
 Uh,
 as
 I
 said,
 both
 in


studio.
 All right,
 guys.
 Let's
 start


with
 JP
 Morgan
 because
 I
 feel
 like


that's
 the
 bank
 that
 we
 want
 to
 always


hear
 from.
 Uh,
 Allison,
 let
 me
 start


with
 you.
 What
 do
 we
 need
 to
 know
 about


the
 numbers
 in
 JP
 Morgan's
 business?


Because
 as
 Matt
 says,
 sometimes
 the


headlines
 look
 darn
 good.


>> And
 the
 quarter
 was
 darn
 good.
 It's
 just


that
 I
 think
 there
 are
 some
 bullish


investors
 out
 there
 that
 wanted
 more
 and


if
 you
 did
 you
 know
 so
 on
 today
 they're


underperforming
 but
 if
 you
 looked
 at


year
 to
 date
 if
 you
 look
 at
 their


valuation
 if
 you
 look
 at
 their
 year
 to


returns
 uh
 I'm
 sorry
 you
 look
 at
 their


profitability
 all
 very
 very
 good


executing
 well
 think
 that
 you
 know
 maybe


some
 people
 just
 wanted
 some
 more
 there


um
 Goldman
 Sachs
 also
 strong
 quarter


they
 did
 miss
 on
 equities
 trading
 so
 um


you
 know
 these
 numbers
 are
 hard
 to


predict
 but
 I
 think
 you
 know
 most
 people


including
 myself,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 had


seen
 sort
 of
 that
 that
 upside
 would
 give


you
 sort
 of
 further
 uh
 confidence
 in
 the


momentum
 going
 into
 the
 next
 quarter.


But
 the
 M&A
 advisory
 business,
 huge


outperformance
 there.
 Um
 we
 think
 they


probably
 outperformed
 most
 people
 in
 the


quarter.
 They're
 the
 lead
 in
 that


revenue.
 They
 announced
 this
 uh
 AI


program.
 There's
 details.
 You
 know,


we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 wait
 till
 January


for
 details,
 but
 that
 signals
 that


efficiency
 is
 going
 to
 get
 better.
 you


know,
 contrast,
 you
 know,
 two
 companies


that
 are
 really
 uh
 performing
 very
 well


to
 two
 companies
 that
 are,
 I
 think,
 have


a
 lot
 of
 runway
 ahead
 of
 them,
 and


that's
 Wells
 Fargo
 and
 City
 Group.


>> Can
 I
 just
 ask
 before
 we
 get
 to
 Sri


because
 I've
 already
 asked
 him
 like
 10


times
 today.
 Why
 do
 the
 analysts


consistently
 underestimate


um
 what
 these
 banks
 are
 doing?
 And
 it


can't
 just
 be
 to
 get
 on
 the
 good
 side
 of


management,
 right?
 Um
 when
 I
 see
 this


morning
 before
 any
 earnings
 came
 out
 I


saw
 stories
 about
 which
 bank
 was
 going


to
 beat
 estimates.
 So
 when
 I
 see
 bank


expected
 to
 top
 estimates
 I
 wonder
 why


analysts
 don't
 add
 more
 to
 the


estimates.
 What's
 what
 what
 is
 this
 game


all
 about?


>> Well
 first
 of
 all
 trading
 and
 when
 it's


capital
 markets
 revenue
 that
 really
 is


the
 source
 of
 the
 upside
 that
 is
 very


tough
 and
 banks
 are
 not
 going
 to
 guide


you.
 you
 know,
 they
 don't
 really
 have
 an


incentive
 to
 guide
 you
 because,
 by
 the


way,
 like
 the
 last
 couple
 of
 days
 of
 the


quarter
 could
 be
 horrible
 or
 you
 don't


know
 what's
 going
 to
 happen.
 And
 so,
 I


think
 banks
 are
 going
 to
 tend
 to
 guide


conservatively.
 Analysts
 are
 going
 to


tend
 to
 be
 conservative,
 right?
 Because


that
 um
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 like
 that
 just


is
 not
 something
 that
 people
 bake
 into


the
 run
 rate.
 So,
 as
 I
 said,
 you
 know,


we're
 positive
 about
 the
 momentum
 in


trading,
 the
 asset
 levels,
 etc.
 But
 I


think
 if
 you're,
 you
 know,
 forming


estimates,
 you
 are
 going
 to
 tend
 to
 be


conservative
 and
 that's
 why
 you
 can
 get


upside,
 especially
 if
 the
 strength
 comes


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 quarter.
 It's
 just


hard
 for
 the
 estimates
 to
 catch
 up.


>> Yeah,
 totally
 get
 it.
 Uh,
 all right.
 So,


we
 care
 about
 JP
 Morgan's
 results.
 We


also
 obsess
 over
 everything
 that
 Jaime


Diamond
 has
 to
 say.
 He
 never
 disappoints


with
 something
 that
 is
 highly
 quotable.


In
 this
 case,
 uh,
 it
 was
 when
 he
 was


talking
 about
 a
 cockroach.
 Check
 it
 out.


Like
 you
 should
 assume
 that
 if
 ever


something
 happens,
 we
 need
 to
 scour
 all


process,
 all
 procedures,
 all


underwriting,
 all
 everything.
 And
 you


know,
 we
 think
 we're
 okay
 in
 other


stuff,
 but
 I
 I
 my
 my
 antenna
 goes
 up


when
 things
 like
 that
 happen.
 And
 I


probably
 shouldn't
 say
 this,
 but
 when


you
 see
 one
 cockroach,
 there
 probably


more,
 you
 know,
 and
 so
 we
 we
 should


everyone
 should
 be
 foreworn
 on
 this
 one.


>> All
 right,
 that
 of
 course
 was
 Jamie


Diamond
 uh
 earlier
 today
 on
 uh
 JPM's


earing
 earnings
 call.
 Tree,
 come
 on
 in


on
 this
 because
 you're
 reporting
 on
 the


quarter
 and
 you
 know,
 most
 importantly


what
 Jaime
 Diamond
 has
 to
 say
 about
 the


macro.


>> So
 I
 again
 Jaime
 Diamond
 has
 been


running
 the
 biggest
 US
 bank
 which
 is


which
 has
 a
 bigger
 market
 cap
 today
 than


its
 three
 closest
 rivals
 combined.
 He's


been
 doing
 that
 for
 nearly
 20
 years
 and


he
 didn't
 get
 there
 and
 he
 didn't
 stay


there
 uh
 just
 on
 the
 back
 of
 sitting
 on


his
 laurels,
 right?
 He
 is
 paid
 to
 look


around
 the
 corners
 and
 he
 is
 right
 to


point
 out
 that
 the
 underlying
 numbers


might
 be
 great.
 They
 might
 be
 marching


toward
 another
 record
 revenue
 year,
 but


when
 you
 see
 some
 of
 these
 problems,
 you


initially
 try
 and
 dismiss
 some
 of
 them


as
 idiosyncratic,
 but
 if
 enough
 of
 them


start
 popping
 up,
 that
 becomes
 a


concern.
 So
 that's
 why
 when
 diamond
 says


my
 antenna
 goes
 up
 when
 things
 like
 that


happen
 we
 pay
 attention
 especially


because
 in
 the
 last
 few
 days
 we've
 been


seeing
 some
 action
 in
 certain
 corners
 of


the
 credit
 market
 where
 it
 does
 appear


that
 there
 is
 some
 fear
 seeping
 into
 the


markets.
 Diamond
 specifically
 flicked
 at


the
 publicly
 traded
 uh
 BDC's
 that
 hold
 a


lot
 of these
 private
 credit
 investments.


And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 discount
 to
 the


net
 asset
 value
 that
 they're
 going
 at,


it
 it
 makes
 you
 worry
 about
 what's


happening
 with
 some
 of
 the
 other


non-traded
 vehicles.
 Will
 there
 be
 mass


redemptions?
 And
 will
 there
 be
 domino


effects
 off
 of
 that?
 And
 Diamond
 also


points
 out
 that
 he
 feels
 like
 they're


feeling
 very
 good
 about
 everything


there.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 their
 numbers,
 you


will
 not
 see
 any
 cause
 for
 stress,


dismay,
 concern.
 But
 Diamond
 is
 right
 in


saying
 eventually
 the
 cycle
 turns.
 And


when
 it
 does,
 he
 thinks
 that
 I
 suspect


when
 there's
 a
 downturn,


>> his
 words,
 you
 will
 see
 higher
 than


normal
 downturn
 type
 of
 credit
 losses
 in


certain
 categories.
 And
 that's
 an


important
 one
 to
 keep
 in
 mind
 because


what
 he's
 saying
 is
 your
 recovery
 rates


might
 not
 be
 as
 great
 as
 you
 imagined


and
 that
 will
 impact
 the
 firms
 and


that'll
 impact
 the
 investors
 in
 those


firms.


>> I
 want
 to
 ask
 about
 uh
 Wells
 Fargo.
 I'm


so
 thankful
 that
 uh
 Bloomberg
 Radio
 has


such
 a
 great
 program.
 In
 the
 mornings,


Nathan
 Hager
 and
 Karen
 Moscow
 were


talking
 to
 you,
 Allison,
 before
 I
 even


got
 to
 work
 yet
 and
 I
 get
 here
 pretty


early
 and
 you
 were
 saying
 this
 is
 really


going
 to
 be
 the
 news
 of
 the
 day
 and
 it


has
 been
 the
 outperformer
 of
 the
 day


because


>> can
 I
 just
 say
 finally?


>> Well,
 because
 long


>> so
 what's
 the
 story
 with
 Wells
 Fargo?


They
 raised
 their
 return
 on
 uh
 tangible


equity.


>> Yep.
 So,
 so
 the
 the
 key
 metric
 for
 banks


return
 on
 tangible
 common
 equity


valuations,
 you
 know,
 price
 to
 book
 is


is
 how
 a
 lot
 of
 investors
 value
 these


banks.
 It's
 based
 on
 the
 return
 on


capital.
 And
 you
 know,
 Charlie
 Sheriff


had
 said
 years
 ago,
 we're
 going
 to
 put


15%
 out
 there
 as
 a
 as
 a
 target.
 We'll


revisit
 it
 at
 some
 point.
 They're


running
 at
 15%
 year-to
 date.
 They
 up


that
 target
 to
 17
 to
 18%.


Um
 the
 asset
 cap
 is
 lifted.
 They
 showed


a
 lot
 of
 uh
 progress
 that
 they've
 made,


but
 they
 also
 showed
 some
 opportunity.


And
 here's
 uh
 what
 I
 think
 is


interesting.
 So,
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


areas
 of
 opportunity
 is
 the
 consumer


unit.
 Uh
 when
 we
 had


uh
 Lori
 Beer
 from
 JP
 Morgan,
 the
 CIO
 of


JP
 Morgan,
 uh
 talk
 about
 where
 she
 sees


big
 opportunity.
 She
 actually
 talked


about
 this
 at
 JP
 Morgan's
 investor
 day.


also
 the
 consumer
 unit
 also
 like
 a
 lot


of
 the
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 she
 talked
 about
 in


terms
 of
 how
 technology
 was
 going
 to
 aid


the
 bank
 was
 in
 the
 it
 was
 productivity


in
 the
 consumer
 unit.
 So
 we're
 hearing


that
 from
 Wells
 Fargo.
 So
 that
 really


gives
 me
 confidence
 that
 this
 is
 a


number
 that
 they
 can
 shoot
 to.
 Uh
 Croup


by
 the
 way
 I
 think
 you
 know
 they're
 also


kind
 of
 showing
 the
 path
 right?
 So,


Cityroup
 talking
 about
 the
 fact
 that


they
 are
 sort
 of
 twothirds
 the
 way
 there


with
 their
 transformation


and
 we
 have
 Banamax
 coming
 um
 you
 know


it's
 pushed
 out
 a
 little
 bit
 but
 I
 think


showing
 you
 the
 the
 path
 that
 you
 know


could
 that
 be
 group
 again
 talk
 about
 an


even
 longer
 time
 but
 could
 could
 Jane


Frasier
 finally
 be
 the
 one
 to
 get
 it


done


>> and
 I
 will
 point
 out
 like
 with
 Wells


Fargo
 now
 up
 what
 8.2%
 2%
 for
 the
 day.


It's
 their
 best
 day
 since
 since
 election


night,
 since
 Trump
 came
 back
 to
 power.


This
 could
 be
 Wells
 Fargo's
 best
 day


since
 then.
 So
 that
 is
 the
 power
 of


putting
 a
 target
 out
 there.
 And
 I
 point


that
 out
 again
 only
 because
 in
 a
 couple


of
 weeks
 you
 will
 have
 Bank
 of
 America


with
 their
 investor
 day,
 their
 first


investor
 day
 in
 15
 years.
 It
 has
 also


been
 the
 worst
 performing
 big
 bank
 stock


this
 year
 up
 only
 what
 14%
 14
 and


change.
 It
 is
 important
 for
 Bank
 of


America
 to
 approach
 that
 investor
 day


with
 a
 mindset
 of
 providing
 targets,


aspirational
 targets
 for
 the
 market


instead
 of
 wanting
 to
 go
 out
 there.


We're
 trying
 to
 explain
 to
 investors
 and


analysts
 what
 it
 is
 that
 they
 do
 because


I
 think
 investors
 will
 tell
 you
 they


have
 a
 good
 understanding.
 What
 they


want
 is
 better
 targets
 and
 what
 they


want
 is
 them
 achieving
 those
 targets


otherwise
 the
 stock
 will
 continue
 to


languish.


>> All
 right,
 I
 do
 want
 to
 mention
 a


headline
 crossing.
 We
 are
 continuing
 to


monitor
 uh
 President
 Trump
 there
 at
 the


White
 House.
 He
 is
 talking
 also
 about


Russia
 and
 President
 Putin
 saying


President
 Putin
 does
 not
 want
 to
 end
 the


war.
 And
 then
 going
 on
 to
 say
 that
 the


Russian
 economy
 is
 going
 to
 collapse.
 So


that
 is
 certainly
 another
 one
 of
 the
 big


geopolitical
 uh
 events
 and
 actions
 that


we've
 been
 keeping
 and
 something
 that


the
 president
 has
 been
 trying
 to
 bring


an
 end
 to
 and
 talked
 about
 that
 on
 the


campaign
 trail.
 But
 uh
 again,
 President


Putin
 doesn't
 want
 to
 end
 the
 war.
 That


is
 the
 view
 from
 President
 Trump
 at
 the


White
 House.
 I
 know
 you
 had
 one
 last


question
 you
 wanted
 to


>> Yeah,
 I
 wanted
 to
 ask
 Allison
 about
 um


the
 best
 way
 to
 value
 these
 companies.
 I


was
 talking
 with
 Shri
 about
 this
 on


Bloomberg
 TV
 earlier
 and
 David
 George


from
 Beard
 also
 was
 saying
 like
 look
 JP


Morgan
 can
 be
 a
 fantastic
 company
 and
 it


is
 um
 but
 the
 stock
 is
 just
 too


expensive
 which
 is
 why
 he
 doesn't
 have
 a


buy
 rating
 on
 those
 shares.
 And
 then


Shere
 and
 I
 were
 looking
 through
 the


price
 to
 book.
 What
 is
 the
 best
 way?
 How


do
 the
 best
 bank
 investors
 um
 uh
 look
 at


valuations
 that
 that
 makes
 the
 most


sense
 for
 banks?
 because
 I
 think
 it's
 a


little
 different
 than
 other
 equities.


>> It
 is
 different
 because
 so
 if
 you
 think


about
 banks,
 right,
 versus
 other
 kind
 of


companies,
 they
 use
 their
 balance
 sheet


to
 generate
 profits.
 And
 so
 that's
 why


return
 on
 tangible
 common
 equity
 is
 a


key
 metric,
 right?
 Because
 the
 more
 uh


profitability
 that
 you
 can
 generate


using
 your
 balance
 sheet,
 the
 more


you're
 willing
 to
 pay.
 So
 that's
 a


little
 bit
 different
 than
 PE.
 You
 all


notice
 that
 uh
 price
 to
 book
 is
 really


favored
 u
 in
 downturns.
 It's
 a
 place


where
 people
 look
 for,
 you
 know,
 in


terms
 of,
 you
 know,
 one
 times
 price
 a


book
 is
 sort
 of
 if
 you
 if
 you
 liquidate


the
 bank,
 what
 can
 I
 get
 for
 this
 versus


the
 ongoing


um
 returns?
 And
 that's
 why
 you
 have


companies
 like
 Croup
 trading
 below


tangible
 book
 or
 below
 book,
 which
 um


obviously
 they've
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 progress


since
 then,
 but
 for
 a
 long
 time
 um
 bank


was
 trading
 at
 like
 20%
 book
 value.


Well,
 well,
 and
 the
 European
 banks,


right,
 because
 they're
 they're
 not


earning
 their
 cost
 of
 capital.
 So,


basically,
 you're
 eroding
 value
 over


time.
 So,
 that's
 sort
 of
 the
 opposite.


And
 so,
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 those
 are


kind
 of
 like
 two
 two
 different
 ways
 to


think
 about
 it.
 By
 the
 way,
 JP
 Morgan
 al


management
 also
 talking
 about
 their
 not


liking
 to
 buy
 shares
 back
 at
 this
 level.


I
 heard
 that.
 You
 know,
 they're
 they're


pretty
 daring
 that
 they're
 willing
 to


call
 that
 out.
 Um,
 but
 from
 an
 equity


investor
 standpoint,
 that's
 not
 really


helpful
 either.


>> Hey,
 22nd
 Street.
 Uh
 what
 do
 we
 have?


BFA
 and
 Morgan
 Stanley
 tomorrow.
 Just


quickly
 what
 what
 you're
 watching
 out


for.


>> We
 have
 BFA
 Mongusani
 tomorrow.
 Again,


we
 have
 analyst
 expectations
 set
 out


there.
 So,
 we're
 hoping
 they'll
 go
 and


beat
 them.
 But
 which
 brings
 us
 back
 full


circle
 to
 Matt's
 original
 point,
 like
 I


don't
 know
 what
 he
 wants
 analysts
 to
 do.


Should
 they
 apply
 a
 humility
 premium
 to


when
 executives
 guide?
 If
 I
 were
 if
 I


were
 estimating
 someone's
 earnings,
 I


would
 try
 and
 get
 it
 right.
 And
 if
 I
 got


it
 if
 I
 was
 lowballing
 it
 for
 the
 last


nine
 out
 of
 10
 quarters,
 I
 would
 just


add
 20%.
 You're
 doing
 it
 based
 off of


how
 the
 executives
 are
 guiding
 you.
 What


do
 you
 want?
 A
 gut
 check.


>> Hey
 kids,
 take
 this
 outside.
 Okay.
 All


right.
 We're
 going
 to
 continue
 this


conversation.
 We
 will
 here
 at
 Bloomberg


as
 we
 continue
 the
 bank
 earnings
 uh


throughout
 the
 rest
 of
 this
 week.
 Stay


with
 us.
 More

 Bloomberg

Bloomberg
 Business
 Week
 Daily
 continuing


on
 this
 Tuesday.
 Carol
 Master
 Tim
 is


off.
 Isabelle
 Lee
 in
 the
 house
 and
 uh


one
 of
 the
 names
 that
 we've
 been
 keeping


a
 watch
 on
 today
 is
 AMD
 at
 its
 highs


today,
 up
 as
 much
 as
 uh
 almost
 4%
 I


should
 say,
 finishing
 the
 day
 with
 a


gain
 of
 about
 8/10
 of
 a
 percent.
 uh
 this


after
 saying
 Oracle
 will
 deploy
 a
 large


batch
 of
 its
 forthcoming
 M1450


chips
 next
 year.
 I
 hope
 I'm
 saying
 it


right,
 but
 if
 not,
 I'm
 going
 to
 check
 in


with
 Ian
 King
 who
 will
 set
 the
 record


straight.
 Uh
 the
 news
 coming
 about
 one


week
 after
 AMD
 inked
 a
 chip
 deal
 with


OpenAI
 that
 triggered
 an
 explosive
 rally


in
 AMD
 shares.
 That
 stock
 on
 October
 6


rallying
 almost
 40%
 intraday
 that
 day.


AMD,
 by
 the
 way,
 up
 around
 80%
 or
 so
 uh


year
 to
 date.
 So,
 let's
 get
 the
 latest


on
 his
 reporting
 and
 what
 AMD
 and
 Oracle


are
 up
 to.
 Bloomberg
 News
 US


Semiconductor
 reporter
 Ian
 King
 with
 us


from
 our
 San
 Francisco
 News
 Bureau.
 Um,


Ian,
 good
 to
 have
 you
 here
 with
 Isabelle


and
 me.
 Uh,
 tell
 us
 about
 this
 deal,


what
 exactly
 it's
 all
 about.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 the
 first
 thing
 to
 point


out
 is
 that
 these
 chips
 don't
 actually


exist
 yet.
 This
 is
 a
 planned
 update
 of


the
 product
 line.
 MI450
 is
 what
 they're


called.
 Um
 and
 these
 are
 going
 to
 be


coming
 out
 um
 sort
 of
 this
 time
 next


year
 from
 AMD.
 And
 so
 what
 the
 way
 to


look
 at
 this
 is
 it's
 an
 affirmation
 that


from
 Oracle
 to
 AMD
 that
 hey
 you've
 you


guys
 have
 got
 a
 big
 role
 to
 play
 in
 our


data
 centers
 going
 forward
 and
 this
 kind


of
 adds
 on
 to
 that
 open
 AI
 um
 agreement


that
 you
 already
 spoken
 about.
 So
 it's


it's
 a
 futurebased
 thing
 but
 it's
 a
 very


it's
 a
 confirmation
 that
 uh
 AMD
 is
 is


has
 a
 seat
 at
 the
 table
 here.
 So
 what


factors
 make
 Oracle
 an
 attractive


partner
 for
 AMD
 and
 how
 does
 this
 just


this
 collaboration
 fit
 with
 a
 broader


trend
 of
 cloud
 providers
 securing
 their


own
 AI
 infrastructure?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 ask
 me


to
 unravel
 the
 uh
 the
 spaghetti
 of
 of


connections
 between
 them
 all,
 I'm
 afraid


you're
 talking
 to
 the
 wrong
 person.
 But


um
 let's
 just
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 the
 best


way
 to
 look
 at
 that
 is
 to
 say
 that


Oracle
 is
 obviously
 being
 enormously


aggressive
 uh
 spending
 very
 heavily


trying
 to
 push
 itself
 trying
 again
 to


get
 a
 seat
 at
 the
 table
 here
 to
 be
 um
 a


cloud
 service
 provider
 along
 with
 the


scale
 that
 perhaps
 rivals
 somebody
 like


Amazon
 or
 or
 a
 Google.
 It's
 clearly
 not


there
 yet
 but
 it
 sees
 a
 future
 in
 in


deploying
 this
 technology
 and
 is
 making


a
 big
 bet
 to
 sort
 of
 get
 there.
 So


naturally,
 if
 you're
 wanting
 to
 provide


components
 into
 that
 market,
 having
 uh


you
 know,
 some
 exposure
 to
 Oracle
 being


one
 of
 their
 key
 suppliers
 is
 a
 good


move.


>> That's
 what
 I
 was
 wondering.
 I
 always


think
 about
 this,
 you
 know,
 who
 gets


more
 out
 of
 this
 deal.
 Is
 it
 equal
 or
 is


it
 I
 love
 what
 you
 said
 about
 Oracle


being
 very
 aggressive,
 and
 we've


certainly
 seen
 Oracle
 be
 very


aggressive,
 I
 feel
 like,
 over
 the
 last


couple
 of
 months.
 But
 is
 this
 more
 a


thing
 about
 AMD,
 more
 about
 Oracle,
 or


both?
 Ian?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 the
 recent
 story


has
 I
 would
 say
 had
 you
 know
 obviously


there
 are
 these
 big
 buyers
 of
 the
 chips


and
 we
 have
 to
 see
 those
 chip
 orders


made
 and
 and
 those
 purchases
 go
 ahead


and
 that
 turn
 into
 revenue
 but
 really


AMD
 you
 know
 just
 to
 for
 perspective
 has


less
 than
 2%
 of
 the
 market
 for


accelerators.
 Guess
 who
 has
 the
 rest?


Nvidia
 obviously


>> right?
 So
 2%
 is
 better
 than
 anybody
 else


though
 um
 and
 is
 still
 several
 billion


dollars
 which
 is
 very
 good
 for
 for
 AMD


and
 has
 certainly
 bored
 its
 fortunes.


But
 is
 2%
 really
 you
 know
 a
 a


sustainable
 market
 presence?
 The
 answer


is
 probably
 not.
 AMD
 obviously
 has
 to


evolve
 from
 there.
 Has
 to
 get
 more
 and


more
 um
 confidence
 from
 these
 big
 buyers


who
 frankly,
 you
 know,
 you're
 not
 going


to
 get
 fired
 for
 buying
 an
 Nvidia
 system


right
 now
 if
 you're
 a
 purchase
 manager


because
 everybody
 else
 is.
 Um
 why
 should


you
 take
 a
 risk
 on
 AMD?
 So,
 it's
 very


much
 up
 to
 AMD
 to
 sort
 of
 create
 a
 set


of
 reasons
 for
 people
 to
 make
 those
 bets


and
 it
 looks
 like
 that's
 happening.


>> And
 we
 know
 that
 deployment
 is
 set
 to


begin
 next
 year,
 expansion
 2027
 and


beyond.
 Are
 we
 expecting
 any
 kind
 of


challenges
 on
 the
 part
 of
 AMD
 to
 ensure


maybe
 timely
 delivery
 or
 managing
 the


supply
 chain?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 chips
 are
 difficult,
 right?


Um
 you
 put
 billions
 of
 transistors
 on
 a


very
 tiny
 piece
 of
 silicon
 and
 something


can
 and
 will
 go
 wrong.
 But
 it
 has
 to
 be


said
 in
 AMD's
 favor.
 They
 have
 said,


"Hey,
 we'll
 have
 a
 product
 ready
 and


it's
 been
 ready
 on
 time.
 Then
 we'll
 have


another
 one
 ready
 and
 it'll
 be
 better."


And
 that's
 come
 on
 time.
 So
 this
 isn't


the
 first
 ever
 entree
 for
 them
 into
 this


market.
 this
 is
 the
 you
 know
 third
 or


fourth
 generation
 of
 their
 chips
 and


they
 have
 all
 got
 better.
 They
 all
 have


been
 delivered
 on
 time
 which
 is


obviously
 gaining
 credibility
 for
 that


company
 and
 that
 company's
 presence.
 So


yes,
 a
 lot
 can
 go
 wrong
 and
 and
 does
 go


wrong
 for
 chips
 but
 not
 recently
 for


AMD.
 Uh
 if
 you
 want
 to
 look
 at
 things


going
 wrong
 unfortunately
 that's
 been
 an


Intel
 story,
 not
 an
 AMD
 story
 recently.


Hey,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 Ian,
 we
 were
 just


talking
 with
 um
 Kate
 and
 Matt
 over
 on


the
 T
 uh
 TV
 side
 and
 when
 I
 mentioned
 uh


AMD
 as
 kind
 of
 one
 of
 the
 gainers
 and


stocks
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 and
 that
 the


that
 Oracle
 will
 put
 50,000
 of
 the


semiconductors
 in
 data
 center
 computers


starting
 in
 the
 third
 quarter
 of
 2026.
 M


like
 is
 that
 even
 a
 lot?
 And
 so
 I'm


looking
 at
 your
 story
 where
 you
 say
 in


the
 second
 quarter
 AMD
 shipped
 about


100,000
 AI
 processors.
 It
 seems
 like


50,000
 is
 a
 lot.
 Is
 it
 though?


Um
 it
 really
 depends
 where
 we
 are
 at


that
 particular
 point.
 In
 AMD's
 ideal


world,
 it
 won't
 be
 a
 huge
 part
 of
 their


um
 of
 their
 shipments.
 And
 and
 again,
 we


don't
 know
 exactly
 know
 how
 quickly


those
 shipments
 will
 be
 made,
 but
 it
 is


significant.
 This
 is
 a
 major
 player
 and


that
 is
 not
 a
 small
 number.
 It's
 not
 the


kind
 of
 millions
 or
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 that
 obviously
 Nvidia
 ships,


but
 it
 is
 a
 significant
 amount.


>> How
 does
 this
 affect
 Nvidia?
 Nvidia's


current
 dominance
 in
 AI
 processors.
 I


think
 Nvidia
 is
 still
 king.
 Are
 you


expecting
 this
 to


take
 into
 the
 market
 share
 or
 eat
 into


the
 market
 share
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 AMD


taking
 to
 scale
 production?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 if
 if
 you
 believe
 uh
 Nvidia


and
 if
 you
 believe
 everybody
 else,
 we're


we're
 on
 a
 you
 know
 a
 rocket
 to
 the


moon,
 right?
 That
 everything
 is
 going


up,
 the
 market
 is
 growing
 at
 an
 almost


exponential
 rate
 and
 there's
 room
 for


everybody.
 So,
 you
 know,
 growth
 for
 AMD,


even
 rapid
 growth
 for
 AMD
 doesn't


necessarily
 take
 away
 from
 what
 Nvidia


is
 achieving.
 But
 can
 we
 really
 believe


that?
 Has
 there
 ever
 been
 a
 market


that's
 gone
 up
 like
 this
 forever?
 And


the
 answer
 is
 obviously
 not.
 Um
 and
 so


at
 a
 certain
 point
 um
 can
 AMD
 establish


a
 sustainable
 presence
 um
 and
 create


what
 is
 frankly
 at
 this
 point
 the
 only


likely
 sort
 of
 viable
 competitor
 to


Nvidia
 um
 and
 then
 perhaps
 move
 on
 from


there
 and
 actually
 begin
 to
 take
 market


share
 away
 from
 it
 in
 a
 meaningful
 way.


That
 is
 definitely
 uh
 in
 the
 TBD


character
 right
 now.
 you
 know,
 1 1.9%


whatever
 market
 share
 they're
 at
 versus,


>> you
 know,
 98
 plus
 market
 share
 percent.


That's
 that's
 a
 long
 way
 to
 go
 before


anybody
 needs
 to
 get
 worried.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 huge
 gap.
 Um
 hey,


one
 of the
 things
 I
 wanted
 to
 ask
 you


Ian
 before
 we
 go
 because
 I
 was
 thinking


about
 yesterday
 that
 OpenAI
 Broadcom


deal
 and
 um
 you
 know
 it
 just
 sent
 shares


of
 Broadcom
 rocketing.
 Um
 but
 I
 also


looked
 at
 the
 socks.
 It
 made
 me
 look
 at,


you
 know,
 every
 name
 I
 think
 was
 was


higher
 yesterday
 or
 almost
 every
 one.


Same
 thing
 today.
 A
 lot
 of
 names
 um


we've
 seen
 actually
 today
 was
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 different
 trade,
 but
 it
 just


made
 me
 look
 at
 the
 socks
 which
 is
 up


32%
 year
 to
 date.
 It's
 up
 about
 75%
 from


midappril.
 It
 it
 I
 mean
 does
 it
 make


sense
 that
 every
 name
 is
 higher


considering
 the
 spend
 and
 what
 is
 going


on?


>> Um
 yes
 and
 no.
 I
 mean
 there's
 a
 lot
 goes


into
 a
 data
 center.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of


analog
 chips,
 a
 lot
 of
 power
 converters,


a
 lot
 of
 the
 basic
 components
 that
 are


needed
 to
 support
 these,
 you
 know,


hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 dollars
 worth


of
 computers.
 Uh
 I'm
 talking
 about
 an


individual
 computer.
 So,
 yes
 and
 no.
 But


ultimately,
 the
 real
 winners
 here
 are


it's
 just
 a
 handful
 of
 companies
 and


we've
 been
 talking
 about
 them.
 Broadcom


is
 in
 that
 conversation.
 Nvidia
 is
 the


absolute
 beneficiary
 of
 this
 already
 and


AMD
 is
 trying
 to
 get
 in
 there
 and
 and
 is


is
 showing
 the
 best
 potential
 uh
 to


actually
 get
 in
 there
 and
 and
 be
 a


presence.


>> Well,
 yeah,
 and
 certainly
 one
 we
 were


talking
 about
 uh
 in
 a
 big
 way
 today.


Ian,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Appreciate
 uh


your
 reporting
 finding
 some
 time
 once


again
 for
 us.
 Bloomberg

 coming
 up
 after


this.

 Well,
 even
 so,
 the


world
 is
 kind
 of
 moving
 on
 and
 we're


seeing
 the
 new
 contours
 of
 global


commerce
 taking
 off
 amid
 these
 global


tariffs.
 Let's
 see
 what
 Enda
 Curran
 has


to
 say
 and
 what
 it
 means
 in
 terms
 of
 the


global
 macro
 environment.
 He
 is


Bloomberg
 News
 global
 economy
 reporter.


He
 joins
 us
 from
 our
 Bloomberg
 News


Washington
 DC
 bureau.
 And
 a
 good
 to
 have


you
 here.
 First
 off,
 we
 do
 see
 these


Wall
 Street
 swings
 on
 what's
 coming
 out


between
 US
 and
 China.
 Why
 is
 this
 still


just
 remind
 everybody
 why
 is
 this
 still


the
 most
 important
 global
 economic


relationship
 in
 the
 world
 or
 is
 it


starting
 to
 kind
 of
 change
 a
 little
 bit?


>> Well,
 they
 are
 the
 two
 world's
 uh


biggest
 economies.
 H
 they
 are
 of
 course


completely
 interlocked
 with
 each
 other.


China
 is
 the
 world's
 biggest


manufacturer,
 but
 of
 course,
 America
 is


their
 biggest
 customer.
 It's
 the
 biggest


um
 consumer
 market
 in
 the
 world.
 So,


obviously,
 the
 trade
 tensions
 between


them
 do
 spill
 over
 to
 everybody
 kind
 of


caught
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 that
 in
 terms
 of


supply
 chains.
 And
 and
 that's
 what
 we're


we're
 kind
 of
 seeing
 some
 reaction
 or


some
 response
 now
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 the


world.
 And
 even
 if
 your
 starting
 point


is
 that
 yes,
 we'll
 always
 have
 to
 do


business
 with
 America
 because
 the


consumer
 is
 so
 powerful
 there,
 trading


partners
 are
 kicking
 tires.
 And
 hang
 on


a
 sec,
 who
 else
 can
 I
 do
 business
 with?


How
 else
 can
 I
 diversify
 my
 markets?


China
 is
 looking
 around
 say
 buying
 more


agricultural
 produce
 from
 South
 America


as
 we
 know,
 but
 also
 its
 exports
 are


going
 gang
 busters
 to
 parts
 of
 the
 world


other
 than
 America.
 And
 then
 those
 other


countries
 in
 the
 middle
 are
 saying,
 you


know,
 who
 else
 can
 we
 start
 doing
 more


trade
 deals
 with?
 They're
 accelerating


trade
 negotiations.
 They're
 uh


accelerating
 ways
 of
 doing
 business
 with


each
 other,
 looking
 for
 new
 markets.
 So


it's
 very
 early
 stages
 but
 um
 that


USChina
 trade
 war
 is
 starting
 to
 poke


some
 change
 in
 the
 global
 trade


>> you
 know
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 the
 question
 is


uh
 the
 question
 that
 JD
 Vance


um
 probably
 doesn't
 have
 an
 answer
 to


can
 China


uh
 be
 cut
 off
 from
 US
 trade
 longer
 than


we
 can
 stay
 solvent
 because
 the
 rare


earth
 minerals
 that
 they
 have
 we
 cannot


get
 um
 in
 size
 from
 anywhere
 else
 and


we're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 process


them
 here
 to
 refine
 them
 here
 anytime


soon.
 So,
 you
 know,
 Meredith
 Whitney
 in


a
 note
 on
 Sunday
 said,
 um,
 aside
 from


the
 massive
 dependence
 on
 the
 US


industrial
 complex
 complex
 for
 these


rare
 earth
 metals
 and
 magnets,
 the
 US


military
 is
 100%
 dependent
 on
 them
 and


nearly
 depleted
 of
 its
 reserves.
 So,
 I


mean,
 don't
 we
 need
 them
 more
 than
 they


need
 us
 right
 now?
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 we


we're
 all
 at
 a
 point
 now
 where
 we
 are


fully
 aware
 that
 if
 there
 is
 a


vulnerability
 in
 the
 hulkish
 trade


stance
 that
 the
 US
 is
 taking
 on
 China,


it's
 on
 rare
 earth
 supplies.
 Um,
 China


is
 the
 one
 digging
 them
 out
 of
 the


ground.
 China
 is
 the
 one
 that's
 taking


on
 the
 refining
 risk
 there,
 the


environmental
 risk
 and
 the
 cost


associated
 with
 it
 at
 a
 scale
 that
 no


other
 country
 is
 doing.
 And
 that's
 why


America
 and
 everybody
 else
 is
 so
 reliant


on
 China
 and
 getting
 those
 minerals
 out


here.
 And
 that's
 why
 China
 of
 course


it's
 well
 aware
 of
 its
 leverage.
 It's


floated
 those
 export
 controls
 that
 it


did
 last
 week
 or
 the
 week
 before
 that
 of


course
 has
 sent
 shock
 waves
 not
 just


through
 the
 US
 but
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world


too.
 And
 China's
 making
 clear
 that
 it's


in
 control
 of
 these.
 Now
 this
 is
 a


policy
 error
 though.
 If
 you
 go
 back


maybe
 15
 years
 ago
 there
 was
 a
 big
 there


was
 a
 discussion
 around
 rare
 earth


supply
 at
 that
 time.
 There
 were
 other


options
 on
 the
 table.
 It's
 not
 just


China
 that
 has
 these
 minerals.
 uh
 other


countries
 could
 have
 put
 money
 into
 the


ground
 and
 put
 the
 money
 into
 the


resources
 and
 the
 facilities
 needed
 to


extract
 these.
 There
 are
 some
 companies


in
 the
 US
 that
 are
 talking
 about
 or


trying
 to
 get
 off
 the
 ground
 at
 the


moment
 in
 doing
 this.
 H
 but
 the
 point
 is


we're
 at
 a
 stage
 where
 China
 has
 a
 grip


and
 a
 lock
 on
 the
 system
 to
 the
 point


where
 everybody
 else
 is
 years
 behind.
 It


will
 take
 a
 long
 time
 and


>> it's
 not
 just
 getting
 them
 out
 of
 the


ground.
 Enda
 I
 mean
 I
 talked
 to
 uh


industrial
 CEOs
 who
 do
 business
 globally


and
 have
 told
 me
 look
 we've
 seen
 the


refining
 process
 in
 China
 and
 it
 is


horrific.
 It
 is
 the
 kind
 of


environmental
 risk
 that
 American
 voters


just
 would
 not
 be
 willing
 um
 to
 take.
 So


no
 one
 else
 can
 refine
 them
 at
 these


levels
 at least
 um
 with
 today's
 methods


um
 without
 sacrificing
 like
 a
 a
 a


portion
 of
 humanity.
 So
 we're
 not
 going


to
 do
 that
 are
 we?


>> Well
 and
 that's
 entirely
 right


environmental
 risk
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 the


equation
 that
 but
 there
 are
 some


companies
 by
 the
 way
 there
 are
 including


some
 in
 the
 US
 who
 are
 looking
 for


cleaner
 ways
 to
 do
 this.
 So
 but


obviously
 nothing
 like
 on
 the
 scale
 that


China
 currently
 offers
 but
 other


countries
 as
 well
 are
 coming
 to
 the


table.
 Pakistan
 for
 example
 is
 floating


itself
 as
 a
 potential
 partner
 for
 these


minerals
 for
 the
 US.
 They
 can
 be
 sourced


from
 other
 countries
 too.
 That's
 why


Argentina
 is
 in
 the
 mix
 at
 the
 moment


when
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 the
 support
 that


the
 US
 Treasury
 is
 offering
 Argentina.


One
 of
 the
 reasons
 is
 because
 of
 the


minerals
 Argentina
 has.
 So
 but
 but
 yes


the
 point
 is
 that
 no
 one's
 doing
 it
 on


on
 the
 scale
 that
 China
 is
 right
 now.


And
 until
 that
 changes
 China
 has


leverage
 over
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 global


trading
 system.
 Hey,
 I
 want
 to
 go
 into


your
 story
 that
 looks
 at
 global
 trade


flows
 and
 you
 look
 at
 what
 shipping


shipping
 companies
 are
 seeing
 and
 some


of
 the
 changes,
 but
 there's
 a
 um
 a
 quote


in
 the
 story,
 an
 associate
 professor
 of


economics
 at
 the
 University
 of


California
 at
 Davis,
 uh
 Ena
 Siminoca,


and
 it
 said
 this
 individual
 saying,


"It's
 very
 clear
 that
 we
 are
 redrawing


the
 map
 of
 international
 trade.
 We're


going
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 more
 bilateral
 trade


agreements
 between
 countries
 and


subgroups
 of
 countries."
 She
 predicts


this.
 Um
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 for


economic
 growth
 for
 individual
 countries


and
 for
 the
 global
 economy
 overall?
 Do


we
 know
 anything?
 Is
 it
 good?
 Is
 it
 bad?


>> Well,
 it's
 early
 stages,
 but
 we're


getting
 we
 are
 seeing
 signs
 now
 that


countries
 are
 looking
 at
 accelerating


trade
 negotiations
 with
 each
 other
 and


signing
 deals
 with
 each
 other.
 Now,
 the


European
 Union
 is
 one
 example.
 They've


finally
 gotten
 that
 deal
 signed
 with


Indonesia.
 they
 are
 getting
 that
 big


trade
 uh
 negotiation
 with
 South
 America


Mercer
 off
 the
 ground
 to
 try
 to
 get
 that


ratified.
 Other
 countries
 are
 also


looking
 at
 doing
 business
 more
 with
 each


other
 like
 New
 Zealand
 and
 Switzerland


and
 the
 UAE
 are
 among
 a
 group
 who've


gotten
 together
 and
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 loose


trading
 agreement
 that
 they've
 pulled


together
 over
 recent
 months.
 And
 the


point
 of
 all
 of
 this
 is
 is
 as
 I
 said
 at


the
 start,
 it's
 nobody
 suggesting
 the
 US


is
 not
 the
 world's
 biggest
 consumer


market
 and
 that
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 do


business
 here.
 That's
 not
 the
 point.
 But


they're
 seeing
 the
 tariffs
 going
 up
 at


the
 fastest
 pace
 since
 World
 War
 II.


It's
 more
 complicated,
 more
 costly
 for


some
 of
 the
 businesses
 who
 want
 to
 do


trade
 with
 the
 US.
 And
 they're
 asking


what
 else
 can
 they
 do
 to
 diversify
 and


mix
 up
 their
 supply
 lands
 and
 their
 and


their
 their
 their
 markets.
 And
 we're


seeing
 it
 in
 Peruvian
 fruit
 farmers.


They're
 looking
 for
 new
 alternative


markets
 uh
 in
 Lysoto.
 They're
 looking


for
 alternative
 textile
 markets
 maybe
 in


Europe
 and
 in
 in
 Asia.
 So,
 you
 know,
 as


I
 say,
 the
 tariff
 wall
 when
 it's
 gone
 up


on
 the
 US
 side,
 it's
 not
 about
 countries


not
 wanting
 to
 do
 business
 here,
 but


they
 are
 certainly
 kicking
 tires
 on


where
 else
 they
 can
 diversify.
 And


that's
 what
 these
 these
 trade


negotiations
 are
 getting
 a
 shot
 in
 the


arm
 as
 one
 of
 one
 of
 the
 professors


quoting
 the
 article
 said
 to
 us.


>> All right,
 we're
 talking
 with
 Anduran,


global
 economy
 reporter
 at
 Bloomberg


News
 in
 our
 DC
 bureau.
 At
 the
 same
 time,


we
 are
 monitoring
 uh
 the
 White
 House,


the
 cabinet
 room.
 President
 Trump
 is


there
 with
 uh
 President
 Malay
 of


Argentina.
 They
 uh
 are
 having
 a


bilateral
 lunch
 and
 obviously
 a
 meeting.


We're
 monitoring
 uh
 any
 headlines
 that


come
 out
 of
 that
 meeting.
 In
 the


meantime,
 you
 know,
 and
 you
 talk
 about


in
 this
 story
 these
 bilateral


relationships
 or
 at least
 folks
 that
 you


talk
 to
 are
 talking
 about
 a
 lot
 more


bilateral
 trade
 agreements.
 Who
 wins


though?
 Big
 countries,
 small
 c


countries,
 middlesized
 countries.
 Um
 is


there
 clear
 winners
 and
 losers
 on
 that


metric?


>> Well,
 probably
 the
 biggest
 countries


will
 be
 the
 ones
 who
 come
 out
 of
 this
 in


better
 order
 because
 you
 know
 the
 system


up
 until
 now
 whether
 one
 agrees
 with
 it


or
 not
 but
 the
 broad
 system
 up
 until
 a


few
 years
 ago
 had
 been
 rules
 of
 the
 road


set
 by
 the
 World
 Trade
 Organization.


This
 is
 where
 countries
 big
 and
 small


could
 come
 together
 and
 have
 their


disagreement
 and
 argue
 out
 their
 case


for
 whatever
 their
 grievance
 was
 in
 the


trade
 world.
 Um
 but
 you
 know
 we've
 moved


past
 that
 now.
 we're
 kind
 of
 moving
 into


this
 bilateral


sort
 of
 approach
 to
 doing
 trade
 deals.


So
 when
 you
 have
 a
 big
 country,
 they


they
 are
 able
 to
 set
 the
 terms
 on
 the


table
 and
 the
 smaller
 country
 of
 course


has
 to
 work
 around
 that.
 And
 that's


where
 we
 are.
 It's
 not
 just
 it's
 not


just
 the
 US
 of
 course
 and
 China
 is
 the


other
 big
 uh
 player
 in
 the
 global


trading
 system.
 They
 as
 we
 just
 spoke


about
 hold
 the
 cards
 in
 so
 many
 areas


now
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 not
 just
 rare


earths
 but
 they're
 the
 world's
 you
 know


factory.
 So
 they
 also
 will
 set
 terms
 and


and
 countries
 are
 worried
 about
 China's


volume
 of
 exports
 and
 trying
 to
 compete


against
 China
 too
 given
 the
 scale
 and
 uh


competitiveness
 of
 which
 they
 can


produce
 uh
 products
 versus
 other


countries.
 So
 the
 big
 picture
 is
 better


for
 bigger
 countries
 tougher
 for
 smaller


countries.

>> on
 Bloomberg
 radio.
 All right,
 folks.


Let's
 get
 to
 it.
 Uh
 we've
 got
 about
 18


minutes
 to
 go
 until
 we
 wrap
 up
 the
 trade


on
 this
 Tuesday.
 Carol
 Master
 along
 with


Isabelle
 Lee.
 Tim
 is
 off
 this
 week
 and


we've
 got
 a
 market
 that's
 just
 rolling


over
 its
 best
 levels
 of
 the
 session.
 So,


what
 does
 that
 mean?
 We're
 down
 about
 12


points
 on
 the
 S&P
 500
 and
 we've
 got
 the


NASDAQ
 100
 which
 is
 uh
 been
 under
 more


pressure
 today.
 It's
 down
 about
 2/3
 of


1%.
 It's
 down
 about
 161
 points.
 I
 look


at
 the
 S&P
 500
 though.
 Uh
 Isabelle,


still
 most
 names
 in
 the
 index
 are
 higher


today.
 Can
 I
 talk
 about
 crypto?


>> You
 can
 talk
 about
 crypto.


>> Bitcoin
 is
 down
 by
 more
 than
 3%
 and


Ether
 is
 the
 one
 leading
 the
 broader


downturn.
 Actually,
 it's
 the
 largest


altcoin.
 It's
 down
 by
 almost
 5%
 wiping


out
 really
 billions
 since
 the
 biggest


1-day
 industry
 drop
 on
 Friday.


>> It's
 been
 We've
 seen
 crypto
 under


pressure
 as
 of
 late,
 right?
 A
 lot
 of


pressure
 and
 that
 really
 raises
 a


question
 of
 we
 thought
 this
 was
 the


haven,
 but
 then
 it's
 behaving
 like
 a


risk
 asset.


>> It's
 really
 funny
 because
 I
 feel
 like


Yeah,
 we
 see
 it.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.
 We


see
 it
 kind
 of
 following
 the
 markets


really
 closely.
 Hey,
 let's
 get
 to
 uh


some
 of
 the
 earnings
 that
 we
 saw
 today.


Uh
 we've
 talked
 about
 the
 big
 banks
 uh


so
 far
 that
 were
 out
 early
 this
 morning.


Another
 one
 that
 came
 out
 is
 Black


Rockck.
 Stocks
 up
 about
 three
 and
 a


half%
 in
 today's
 session.
 Uh
 rling
 is


the
 world's
 largest
 fund
 manager
 pulled


in
 205
 billion
 of
 client
 money
 in
 the


third
 quarter
 and
 expanded
 its
 footprint


in
 private
 credit
 and
 alt
 assets.
 As
 we


drive
 to
 the
 close,
 Kathy
 Seafford
 is


with
 us.
 She's
 vice
 president
 of
 CFR


research.
 She
 covers
 Black
 Rockck.
 She


joins
 us
 from
 New
 Jersey.
 Kathy,
 good
 to


have
 you
 here
 uh
 with
 Isabelle
 and
 me.


Um,
 Black
 Rockck
 investors
 like
 what


they
 got
 from
 the
 company.
 Uh,
 tell
 me


about
 it.
 This
 company
 massive
 sees
 so


much.
 They
 continue
 to
 grow.
 Um,
 do
 you


like
 what
 you
 heard
 from
 the
 company?


>> Yes,
 I
 do.
 And
 I
 have
 a
 buy


recommendation
 on
 Black
 Rockck
 and
 I
 was


encouraged
 by
 what
 I
 heard
 on
 the
 call


and
 also
 in
 the
 numbers
 they
 reported.


And
 basically
 um
 Black
 Rockck
 laid
 out
 a


strategy
 of
 basically
 having
 three


pillars
 of
 growth.
 strong
 ETF
 um
 a


strong
 ETF
 offering
 and
 strong
 ETF


inflows,
 an
 increased
 exposure
 to


alternative
 assets
 and
 an
 enhanced
 suite


of
 offerings
 in
 its
 technology
 services


business
 um
 trademarked
 Aladdin.
 And
 in


the
 quarter
 we
 saw
 basically
 it
 hitting


on
 all
 of
 those
 cylinders.
 Um,
 you
 know,


the
 market
 has
 been
 decent
 this
 quarter


and
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 asset
 managers
 are


going
 to
 see
 their
 assets
 under


management
 grow
 because
 of
 decent
 market


performance.
 But
 it's
 important
 to
 see


who's
 bringing
 in
 or
 who's,
 you
 know,


who's
 producing
 organic
 growth,
 who's


bringing
 assets
 in
 the
 door.
 And
 in


that,
 you
 know,
 on
 that
 score,
 Black


Rockck
 really
 hit
 it
 out
 of
 the
 park


this
 quarter.
 So
 you
 detailed
 the
 three


pillars
 driving
 the
 growth,
 but
 what


caught
 my
 eye
 is
 that
 private
 markets


and
 tax
 services
 revenue
 now
 exceed


those
 from
 ETFs
 and
 fixed
 income.
 And


I'm
 an
 ETF
 reporter,
 so
 this
 really


caught
 my
 antenna.
 Was
 that
 outcome


anticipated
 or
 were
 you
 expecting
 that?


>> Well,
 that
 growth
 that
 we
 saw
 in
 the


quarter
 is
 basically
 there's
 some


year-to-year
 bumps
 because
 of
 the


inclusion
 of
 some
 acquisitions.
 um


that's
 not
 likely
 to
 be
 a
 run
 rate,
 but


nevertheless
 um
 one
 of
 the
 strategies
 at


Black
 Rockck
 is
 to
 increase
 revenue


contributions
 from
 both
 um
 their


technology
 business
 and
 um
 their
 private


market
 business.
 And
 you
 know,
 if
 you'll


recall,
 they've
 spent
 the
 last
 couple
 of


years
 pretty
 aggressively
 acquiring


really
 pipelines
 in
 the
 private
 market


and
 alternative
 asset
 space
 through


which
 they
 can
 grow
 product.
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 they
 did
 it
 very
 intelligently
 and


I
 think
 what
 we
 saw
 this
 quarter
 was
 the


fruits
 of
 their
 labor,
 which
 is
 a


positive.
 Speaking
 of
 private
 markets,


we
 saw
 that
 fees
 there
 have
 grown
 around


136%
 year-over-year
 through
 third


quarter
 of
 2025.
 How
 sustainable
 is
 that


growth,
 especially
 as
 we
 enter
 this


really
 challenging
 macro
 and
 economic


macro
 and
 rate
 environment?


Well,
 I
 mean
 that
 growth
 is
 not
 a
 run


rate
 and
 it
 reflects
 a
 contribution
 from


acquisitions,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 they


can
 produce
 on
 a
 firmwide
 basis
 mid
 teen


revenue
 growth,
 which
 is
 significantly


greater
 than
 many
 of
 their
 peers.
 And
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 asset
 management
 space


on
 one
 end
 of
 the
 spectrum,
 you
 have


kind
 of
 the
 traditional
 longonly
 asset


managers,
 many
 of
 whom
 are
 bleeding


assets
 and
 you
 have
 the
 private
 equity


firms
 that
 have
 had
 really
 good


performance,
 but
 recently
 have
 struggled


a
 little
 bit
 because
 there's
 some,
 you


know,
 issues
 with
 realizations
 and


whatnot.
 Sort
 of
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 that


is
 um
 Black
 Rockck,
 which
 is
 sort
 of
 a


hybrid
 of
 both
 models.
 So
 I
 think
 the


private
 um
 or
 the
 alternative
 asset


revenue
 contribution
 will
 enhance


overall
 revenue
 growth
 but
 the
 ETF


business
 which
 is
 very
 deep
 and
 very


broad
 and
 also
 has
 made
 a
 number
 of


innovations.
 Um
 you
 were
 talking
 about


crypto
 before
 Black
 Rockck
 B
 brought
 in


more
 crypto
 assets
 than
 some
 of
 its


competitors
 brought
 in
 firmwide
 in
 this


quarter.
 So
 you
 know
 their
 suite
 of
 ETFs


is
 really
 unmatched
 and
 you
 have
 the


combination
 of
 those
 two
 things
 really


widens
 the
 competitive
 edge
 or
 the


competitive
 moat
 around
 Black
 Rockck


when
 you
 look
 at
 alts
 uh
 crypto
 and
 then


traditional
 assets.
 Is
 it
 just
 a
 moment


of
 time
 or
 just
 um
 before
 we
 start
 to


see
 alts
 and
 crypto
 on
 par
 with


traditional
 assets?


>> What
 in
 what
 way
 do
 you
 mean
 on
 par?


terms
 of
 making
 up
 their
 overall
 asset


composition
 in
 terms
 of
 assets
 under


management.
 So
 I'm
 just
 saying
 as
 we
 see


the
 growth
 we
 you
 know
 we
 know
 we
 hear


from
 Larry
 Frink
 and
 from
 Black
 Rockck


overall
 about
 the
 importance
 of
 private


markets,
 private
 credit.
 So
 I'm
 just


curious
 if
 you
 see
 a
 moment
 in
 time
 um


or
 are
 we
 already
 there?
 Also
 what
 663


billion
 of
 client
 assets.
 So
 I
 guess


we're
 kind
 of
 there
 or
 close
 to
 it,


right?


We're
 close
 to
 it,
 but
 I
 don't
 I
 mean
 I


don't
 necessarily
 know
 if
 Black
 Rockck


is
 um
 for
 is
 necessarily
 um
 you
 know


wanting
 that
 mix
 to
 shift
 that
 much.
 I


mean
 there
 is
 there
 is
 a
 positive
 to


having
 alternative
 assets.
 They
 tend
 to


not
 be
 um
 as
 correlated
 to
 the
 broader


markets
 as
 you
 know
 equities
 and
 fixed


incomes
 are.
 But
 you
 know
 for
 Black


Rockck
 it
 was
 important
 because
 the
 the


ETF
 business
 was
 becoming
 increasingly


commoditized.
 Fee
 structures
 were
 pretty


rapidly
 decelerating.
 Um
 shifting
 into


alts
 and
 private
 credit
 uh
 you
 know


achieve
 several
 goals.
 Um
 it
 enhances


their
 competitive
 position
 but
 it
 also


enhances
 their
 revenue
 growth
 which
 is


important.


>> Is
 there
 any
 question
 that
 wasn't


answered
 for
 you?
 Just
 got
 about
 25


seconds.


Um,
 no.
 I
 think
 the
 the
 one,
 you
 know,


the
 one
 issue
 at
 um
 at
 Block
 Rock
 is
 a


succession
 issue.
 I
 don't
 think
 Glarink


is
 leaving
 anytime
 soon,
 but
 that's


always,
 you
 know,
 that's
 kind
 of
 always


an
 issue
 and
 sort
 of
 what
 executive


changes
 they're
 going
 to
 make
 to
 sort
 of


bolster
 their
 operations
 um
 amid
 this


this
 asset
 mix
 shift.


>> All
 right,
 going
 to
 leave
 it
 on
 that


note.
 Kathy,
 great
 to
 get
 some
 time
 with


you.
 Kathy
 Seaffort,
 she's
 vice


president
 CFR
 research
 uh
 covering
 Black


Rockck
 as
 she
 mentioned
 at
 the
 top.
 Uh


she
 does
 have
 a
 buy
 rating
 on
 the
 stock.


Black
 Rockck
 shares
 up
 3.6%.
 Do
 you
 want


to
 share
 on
 a
 competing
 network?
 Uh


Black
 Rockck
 CEO
 Larry
 Frink
 said
 AI
 is


not
 a
 bubble
 but
 there
 will
 be
 failures.


And
 he
 said
 uh
 on
 AI
 in
 terms
 of
 I
 guess


their
 own
 spending.
 This
 is
 capital
 that


is
 mostly
 well
 spent.


>> I
 know
 right.


>> Yeah.
 Time
 will
 tell.
