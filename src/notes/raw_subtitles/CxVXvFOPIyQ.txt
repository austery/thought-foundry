One October evening in 2016,
an Arkansas farmer was sitting in his 
pickup truck just outside his field,
and he was growing impatient.
Suddenly, another car pulled up 
beside him, so the farmer got out.
Seconds later,
he was murdered.
The farmer's name was Mike Wallace.
He wasn't killed over money or land.
He was killed over a herbicide, a 
chemical designed to destroy weeds.
This herbicide spread fear through rural 
America, turning farmers against each other,
all because it belonged to a certain company.
This company's policies,
they pitted farmer against farmer,
and they could just send henchman to your door.
Even if you just had the 
wrong seeds in your field,
they could send you to court and bankrupt you.
In effect, they had a farmland monopoly.
They owned more than 80% of the 
seeds planted in the United States.
And to get this monopoly, 
they played the legal system-
Colluding with corrupted EPA officials.
twisted scientific evidence.
Now appears to have been caught red-handed.
But the chemicals they were making
destroyed the health of 
communities all over the world.
This is a video about Monsanto,
one of the biggest agricultural 
companies in the world.
Our investigation is based on 
publicly available documents,
recordings and third-party opinions.
All sources are linked in the description.
In 1942, a chemist named Franklin D. Jones
made an unusual enemy:
poison ivy.
See, his children had a very 
violent reaction to the plant.
They would get intense rashes and swelling 
when they brushed up against the ivy,
 
so Jones wanted a way to kill it.
He experimented by spraying the ivy with hormones,
chemicals that could regulate the plant's  
functions the same way they 
do in humans and animals.
His hope was that one of these 
hormones would cause it to die.
Unfortunately, many had no effect and 
others only made the ivy grow better.
But then, one day, Jones noticed 
that certain samples began to show  
autumn colors, much sooner than they should have.
He watched as the vibrant 
hues turned to twisted shapes,
and then within days, these 
plants shriveled up and died.
Jones checked the chemical he 
sprayed them with, and surprisingly,
it was a growth hormone called 2,4-D.
It's an acid made up of a ring of six carbons and  
hydrogens called a benzene 
ring, with an acid tail.
There are also two chlorine atoms in 
the two and four positions of the ring,  
which is why it's called 2,4-D.
To keep things tidy, we don't have to 
draw all these carbons and hydrogens,  
but keep in mind they're still there.
Jones realized this synthetic 
hormone was incredibly potent.
Tiny amounts of it would still 
encourage the ivy to grow,
but if he sprayed on a lot 
of it, 2,4-D would trigger  
such uncontrollable and unsustainable growth
that the poison ivy would die in the process.
So effectively, he had plant cancer in a bottle.
I was just going to say plant cancer.
Right?
That's immediately where my brain went.
What was even more remarkable was 
that it only targeted the ivy.
The grass around it was barely affected, 
like it was resistant to 2,4-D.
So over the next two years, Jones performed 
over a hundred different experiments
by pouring the herbicide onto 
many different plant species.
And what he figured out was 
that 2,4-D was really picky.
It killed broad-leaved weeds like 
dandelions, chickweed, and poison ivy,
but it virtually ignored crops.
Wheat, corn, and barley were all mostly  
unaffected by 2,4-D because all 
of these are species of grass.
To improve this pickiness further, Jones 
also tested chemicals similar to 2,4-D.
He found that adding another 
chlorine to the benzene ring,
transforming it to 2,4,5-T, left 
grasses even more unscathed.
He was onto something huge.
Because up until then, farmers could 
get rid of weeds one of two ways.
Either you spray them with 
dangerous chemicals like arsenic
or you have to pull the weeds out manually.
Either way, you're at a loss.
But with 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, you could spray your 
entire crop field, and only the weeds would die.
Jones had stumbled upon the first 
practically viable selective herbicides,
so he was quick to patent them in 
1945, just as the war was ending.
After the Allies victory, the patent secrecy 
restrictions in most countries were lifted,
and it turned out that there were other 
scientists, both in the US but also in the UK,  
who discovered these herbicides independently.
Soon, the world was blessed with 
modern miracle weed killers,  
like Weedone and Weed-A-Bomb and Endo-Weed,
all formulations of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T herbicides.
This man is ready to kill weeds, because 
he's going to do it the easy way.
These chemicals literally replaced the hoe,  
and everything from farm fields 
to railroad tracks and sidewalks.
They're essentially what gave us that beautiful 
green American lawn, just grass and nothing else.
Because with these herbicides, dad knew there 
was no longer any excuse for a weedy lawn.
By the late 1940s, their herbicide business 
had turned into a roughly $10 million industry,
and everyone wanted in, including one of 
the biggest chemical companies at the time:
Monsanto.
One of Monsanto's main herbicide 
factories was in Nitro, West Virginia,
where they pumped out almost 
a ton of 2,4,5-T a day.
By 1949, Monsanto's business was 
booming, when all of a sudden...
the plant exploded.
Over a hundred workers rushed out to see a 
dark cloud rising 40 meters above the factory.
They watched as a black stinking powder 
started raining down on their faces.
Within hours, many of these men fell ill.
First, they got headaches and nausea,  
but then their skin began to erupt 
with bumps, pustules, and acne.
The lesions on some of the workers' 
faces got so bad that Monsanto's  
on-site doctors had to peel off layers of 
their skin in an attempt to remove them.
The doctors later noted that when these men are 
in a closed room together, there is a strong odor.
They wrote, "We believe these men are excreting 
a foreign chemical through their skins."
But neither the doctors nor anyone else 
at Monsanto knew what the chemical was
because both 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D 
were marketed as very safe.
See, when the herbicides were first getting 
introduced, Jones, the original inventor,
even remarked that he knew people 
who would accidentally drink or  
spray the herbicides onto themselves, 
and they suffered no ill health effects.
They were fine.
And one of the doctors after him remarked that:
"I've personally taken one half a gram 
of pure 2,4-D a day for three weeks.
You judge the results."
It was the '40s, so people were a bit crazy.
But yeah, it seemed pretty safe.
Back at Nitro, Monsanto analyzed all the other 
ingredients they were using to make 2,4,5-T,
but they still couldn't find what was causing 
their workers' skin to erupt in this way.
This is where their search seemingly stopped.
With no culprit, the conditions at 
the plant stayed mostly the same,  
and Monsanto just offered their workers a choice:
either you'll keep on working with 2,4,5-T
or you can take the gate.
For many, this was no choice at all since 
there were hardly any other jobs in town.
So, most of the workers stayed 
with something inside the factory,  
poisoning them for years to come.
It wasn't until 1957, 8 years after the explosion,
that a German dermatologist, Karl Schulz,  
found himself treating patients with 
similar-looking lesions and acne.
He wasn't surprised by the symptoms because  
many of these patients worked in 
2,4,5-T factories around Hamburg.
But when Schulz would test these 
ingredients from the instruction  
list on rabbit ears he had at the 
lab, he would get no reactions.
And this puzzled him.
How do these ingredients do 
nothing in his own tests,
but at the same time cause these painful 
skin disorders inside 2,4,5-T factories?
Well, to make 2,4,5-T, you 
start with tetrachlorobenzene,  
a benzene ring with four 
chlorine atoms attached to it.
These chlorine atoms are very electronegative, so 
they want to steal electrons from nearby atoms.
Luckily for them, the six 
carbons in the benzene ring  
are all sharing their electrons in these 
fuzzy donut-shaped clouds around the ring.
That's what this circle in the 
diagram is meant to represent.
The chlorine atoms pull on this electron cloud, 
bringing it closer to themselves, and as a result,
the carbons in the benzene ring 
become slightly positively charged  
and the chlorine's slightly negatively charged.
Now, if you heat up tetrachlorobenzene 
with sodium hydroxide,
one of the negative hydroxide ions will want to  
bind to one of the slightly positively 
charged carbons in the benzene ring.
And to do that, it forces out the 
chlorine atom, taking its place.
This creates trichlorophenol, or TCP, a 
key ingredient in making the herbicide.
From here, if you keep the 
reaction at 170 degrees Celsius,
you can add a series of chemicals to grow out 
this oxygen tail into an acid, giving you 2,4,5-T.
On paper, this is all there is.
If you follow the exact steps here and control 
the conditions, then none of these ingredients  
will explain the horrible face eruptions 
that the Nitro workers were experiencing.
But Schulz wasn't satisfied with this.
Maybe the conditions aren't perfect.
Maybe there is something in this 
process, some secret reaction  
that is contaminating the whole chemical supply.
Ideally, the industrial process 
of transforming tetrachlorobenzene  
into 2,4,5-T should happen at 170 degrees Celsius.
But if the temperature gets any 
higher, even just a few degrees higher,  
there is suddenly enough energy in the system 
for two molecules of TCP to fuse together.
This creates a molecule commonly known as dioxin.
It forms only in trace amounts, so you 
might expect to end up with roughly one  
or two molecules of dioxin for every 
hundred thousand molecules of 2,4,5-T.
It seemed too small to be a problem.
Nevertheless, Schulz decided to test it.
He took some TCP, this time contaminated with  
trace amounts of dioxin, and 
rubbed it into his own skin,
and he got the same acne as 
the workers at the Nitro plant.
Once Schulz realized the threat here,  
he immediately contacted all the 
big chemical producers in Germany,
and one of these German companies even 
sent letters to both Monsanto and Dow,  
the other big herbicide producer in the US,
and they warned them that the acne-causing effects  
are stemming from pollution through 
byproducts, referring to dioxin.
They even listed when exactly during the process  
the contamination was happening 
and what to do to prevent it.
Yet, Monsanto denied ever getting these letters, 
and Dow said they somehow misfiled them.
Regardless, it was obvious to 
both companies that something  
in the production of 2,4,5-T 
was poisoning their workers.
But Monsanto didn't warn 
the public about the danger,
perhaps because the herbicides were 
about to make them a whole lot of money.
In 1961, the president of South Vietnam was 
at war with the newly founded Viet Cong.
This guerrilla force was set on overthrowing his 
rule and uniting Vietnam under a communist regime.
The Viet Cong were masters of the jungle.
They laid deadly traps for their enemies 
and ambushed them using underground tunnels.
South Vietnam was losing the war, 
so the president faced a choice:  
either accept defeat in the jungle or destroy it.
He reached out to his allies, 
the US, and asked them for help.
Soon, they came in flying with 
thousands of barrels of herbicide.
This was the start of Operation Ranch Hand.
The US's herbicide of choice was Agent Orange,
a 50/50 split of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T supplied 
by the US's biggest chemical manufacturers.
The largest supplier by volume was Monsanto.
Agent Orange ravaged through South 
Vietnam destroying 20% of the jungles.
And civilians and soldiers on both sides 
got sprayed with it too, mostly by accident.
The government assured them 
that it is not toxic to humans,  
animals, or drinking water, but 
Monsanto and Dow knew otherwise.
See during Ranch Hand, they secretly 
exchanged information on their herbicides.
And in one of the letters, 
Dow acknowledged that dioxin,  
which had been contaminating 2,4,5-T for years
was "the most toxic compound 
they have ever experienced",
and that even trace amounts of 
it caused incapacitating acne.
By 1965, it was obvious that both companies 
understood what sort of threat dioxin was,
and yet there are no records 
that Monsanto or Dow ever sent  
communication to the US government 
warning them about the threat.
In fact, Dow's vice president reportedly said,
"If the government learns about this, 
the whole industry will suffer."
As a result, the US sprayed South Vietnam 
with 72 million liters of Agent Orange,
within which was just 80 liters of dioxin.
And even though that doesn't seem 
like much, the damage was irreparable.
Civilians and soldiers on both sides 
suffered from skin diseases and cancer.
Children were born with physical 
and mental disabilities.
By some estimates, as many as three million 
people suffered from the effects of Agent Orange.
This outraged the public.
In 1967, 5,000 scientists signed a petition to the 
president condemning his use of the herbicides.
And Monsanto was under scrutiny too,  
because regulators were catching on 
to the dioxin contained in 2,4,5-T.
The herbicide was about to be phased 
out, compromising their bottom line.
Monsanto needed a miracle, 
and they needed it fast.
Their idea was to replace 
2,4,5-T with a safer herbicide.
But after nine years of research, 
they weren't getting anywhere.
All of the scientists in 
the Agricultural department  
referred to this new initiative as a dead area.
One of the last remaining scientists 
on the project was John E. Franz,
and by early 1970, he was about to give it up too.
But before abandoning the project, Franz 
decided to do one final set of experiments,
so he thought up 19 possible 
assets that could maybe work  
as herbicides and decided to test them out.
He prepped the first herbicide, 
but nothing happened.
The plant was completely fine, 
and the herbicide had no activity.
Then he decided to test the second 
herbicide, and he applied it to a plant.
It was 10 times more powerful than 
any herbicide the team had ever seen.
And allegedly, it made the plants super...
It made the plants super nasty.
That was disgusting.
This miracle compound was glyphosate,
a phosphonic acid group on one end and a 
carboxyl group on the other with a nitrogen,  
hydrogen, or amino group in between.
To make sure it was commercially feasible,  
Franz and his colleague set up 
tests in these outdoor fields.
And as one of the scientists was 
getting back to these test sites,  
he saw the results from the plane.
It was clear as day.
All he could do is write Eureka 
across the performance report.
It was the best herbicide they'd ever seen.
What made it so great at killing plants?
Well, for plants to survive, 
they use a chemical pathway,  
a series of reactions to create three important 
amino acids, acids without which they die.
This process is known as the 
Shikimate pathway because it  
starts with shikimic acid named 
after the Japanese Shikimi flower.
During one of the steps, two acids, S3P and 
PEP need to transform into a third compound,
but they can only do that with the 
help of an enzyme called EPSPS,
which catalyzes the reaction and 
helps the two molecules combine.
However, if glyphosate is 
present during this reaction,  
it will begin to mimic PEP because 
they have a very similar geometry.
And because of that, glyphosate actually binds  
first to EPSPS blocking it 
from acting as a catalyst.
Now, the acids can't transform and the 
whole Shikimate pathway is destroyed.
Without it, there are no amino 
acids and the plant dies.
Crucially, the Shikimate pathway is unique 
to plants and things like bacteria and fungi.
Humans and animals don't have it.
In fact, we have to eat foods that 
contain these three amino acids.
But for Monsanto, this was good 
news because they could market  
that glyphosate targets an enzyme found 
in plants, but not in humans or pets.
After decades of toxic products, Monsanto 
finally had one which they were sure was safe.
And research was also showing 
that after you spray glyphosate,  
the microorganisms in the soil 
break it down into safe byproducts.
It was biodegradable.
Glyphosate was perfect, so they wasted 
no time in getting it on the market.
In 1974, Monsanto had a new hit herbicide...
Roundup.
Roundup is better.
It goes through the plant to 
kill it, tops and rhizomes.
My roots hurt real bad.
Hank, Hank!
Roundup. No root, no weed, no problem.
Farmers loved it because unlike 
2,4-D, glyphosate killed every weed,  
not just broad-leaved ones, but grassy too.
It allowed them to practice 
something called no-till farming.
See, usually to get rid of weeds, you'd have to 
plow up the entire field before planting anything,
and that would hurt the soil, 
and it was also just a lot work.
But with Roundup, what you do is you 
spray the whole field, everything dies,
and then you just plant directly into the residue.
It was easier, faster, and cheaper.
And Roundup was safe to use too.
They marketed it as safer than table 
salt and safe enough to drink, basically.
Roundup can be used where kids and pets will 
play and breaks down into natural materials.
By the late eighties, Monsanto 
was selling seven million pounds  
of Roundup and making a billion dollars each year.
And they weren't going to share a 
penny of that money with anyone.
See, with other herbicides, 
like for example, Alachlor,  
which was moderately popular at the time,
you can tweak the molecule a bit here or there, 
and you still get a very potent weed killer,
so if you patented a specific herbicide,  
your competitors could still use 
hundreds of its close relatives,
which would still work perfectly well 
without violating your patent rights.
But glyphosate was different,
if you were to modify the molecule in any way, 
its herbicidal properties were completely gone,
so Monsanto could rest easy 
knowing that until the year 2000,  
they would be the only ones able to sell it.
But there was a little problem with glyphosate.
See, unlike 2,4-D, which only killed 
broadleaved weeds, Roundup kills everything.
I sprayed some of my own houseplants 
here and well, you can see the results.
Chances are if it's green, 
Roundup is going to kill it.
And this was a problem because farmers could 
only really spray Roundup on their field twice,
either right before planting the 
seeds or right after a harvest.
But for Monsanto, this 
wasn't as much of a problem.
See, they thought if we could somehow make the 
crops like soybean or corn resistant to Roundup,
well then farmers could spray it on 
their field during the whole year,  
and it would keep killing the weeds,
but not the Roundup resistant crops.
Crops which Monsanto could sell them.
And as a result, they would 
have a complete monopoly  
over both the herbicide and the seed supply.
Monsanto's idea was this,
if glyphosate blocks the EPSPS enzyme in plants  
then they could edit the plant's DNA so 
that the cells just create more EPSPS.
If there's enough of the enzyme then 
glyphosate can't block all of it,  
and so the plant can still survive.
They tried this out on 
petunias, but it didn't work.
The flowers would survive a tiny amount of 
Roundup, but a normal dose would still kill them.
Monsanto was kind of stumped, and 
they didn't have time to rest,
because while glyphosate and Roundup were under 
their patents, a Roundup resistant seed wasn't.
And their competitors knew this.
In 1985, a company called Calgene published  
a paper in nature showing that they made 
tobacco slightly resistant to glyphosate.
The paper showed promise, but more importantly,  
it made it clear to Monsanto that 
they were running out of time.
Their researchers were desperate calling 
this patent race the "Manhattan Project".
And then one of the engineers had a genius idea.
Monsanto had a ton of these factories where 
they were converting phosphate into glyphosate,
and they had a lot of sludge 
leaching out of these factories,
so if there was anything living 
around these factories in this sludge,  
there was a chance it was resistant to glyphosate.
The researchers went to one of these factories,  
scooped it out, and found a 
strain of salmonella in there,
which was surprising to them because salmonella 
usually relies on the Shikimate pathway,
but here it was thriving in glyphosate.
Monsanto's scientists isolated 
the salmonella's genetic sequence,
and found that it had evolved a way to 
mutate the shape of its EPSPS enzyme  
so that glyphosate couldn't bind to 
it and block the Shikimate pathway.
The scientists took that salmonella 
DNA and loaded it onto a gene gun,  
not this one here, but it's 
actually surprisingly similar.
See, they placed thousands of these salmonella DNA  
strips onto microscopic gold 
particles in the gene gun,
which they then fired into the plant tissue 
all over, at 1,400 kilometers per hour.
The gold particles would bombard the plant cells, 
and some of them would make it into the nucleus.
Here, the DNA detaches from the gold, and it 
integrates itself into the plant's chromosomes.
Now, every time this cell divides, 
it copies over the new EPSPS gene.
Monsanto scientists planted seeds with these genes 
out in the field and sprayed them with Roundup,
but nothing happened. The soybean was resistant.
Monsanto made sure to act quickly soon 
after they found even more potent bacteria,  
and they were able to make 
other crop species immune too.
And by 1998, they had patents for glyphosate 
resistant canola, corn, and cotton.
They called this lineup of 
GMO seeds Roundup Ready.
These Roundup Ready seeds took 
over the market in an instant.
Already by 2001, more than 70% 
of all soybeans grown in the US  
were Monsanto's with Roundup making 
them more than $2.5 billion a year.
It was the best-selling agricultural product ever.
And every farmer could join in on this 
Roundup plus Roundup Ready revolution  
just by signing Monsanto's 
Technology Use Agreement.
I've got one of these agreements from 2011 
here, and I just wanted to read some terms.
The grower or the farmer who accepts and wants to  
use these seeds agrees to not save or clean 
any crop produced from the seed for planting.
And the farmer also agrees not to supply the seed 
produced from the seed to anyone for planting,
meaning you cannot save the seeds you 
bought last year to plant this year,
and you also cannot share or 
sell your seeds to anyone else.
Here's another one, the farmer agrees 
to identify and allow Monsanto and its  
representatives access to the land 
farmed by the grower or the farmer.
And this allows Monsanto to examine 
and take samples of the crops,  
crop residue or the seeds located therein.
And here's a final one, the grower 
accepts the terms of the following  
notice requirements by signing this agreement,
or by opening a bag of seeds.
So you're agreeing to these terms 
even just by opening a bag of seeds.
If you thought that this contract was crazy,  
you should see the stuff that 
we sign up to today online.
I have some terms and conditions 
here from a social media website.
Here's what it says.
"We may collect biometric identifiers,  
and we may infer your attributes, 
such as age range and gender."
So they're able to scan your face 
and sell that data to advertisers.
And just in the last couple of 
months, companies have been making  
these aggressive pushes to their terms and 
conditions to try and get more of your data,
and they can use it to train AI models 
or just sell it to data brokers.
And this doesn't just mean annoying 
ads and spam emails and phone calls.
Law enforcement can buy your data, 
and normal people can buy it too.
Even stuff like your location history.
And all of that is perfectly legal,
but luckily you can take steps to prevent it 
with the help of today's sponsor, Incogni.
See, I started using Incogni in June.
Look, you can see that they already contacted 
46 data brokers to delete my personal data,
and 42 of those requests have been completed, 
and I've actually been getting fewer spam emails.
The new thing is that they now offer 
an unlimited plan with custom removals.
So if you are browsing online 
and see a website with your data,  
even though it shouldn't have the data,
you can ask one of Incogni's experts 
to manually take it down for you.
And if you want to extend that 
sort of protection to someone else,  
they also have a family plan 
that supports up to five members.
To try it, go to incogni.com/veritasium, 
and use the code Veritasium to get 60% off.
You can also use this QR code.
That's incogni.com/veritasium, or you can

I want to thank Incogni for 
sponsoring this part of the video,
and now back to farmers and the terms 
and conditions they had to sign.
Well, couldn't farmers just decide not 
to use Monsanto's seeds and herbicide?
The thing was, you have Roundup Ready 
seeds and you spray them with Roundup,  
everything's going to be fine on your end.
But your neighbor doesn't 
have Roundup Ready seeds,
so if your herbicide drifts over to your 
neighbor's side, it's going to kill his plants.
So neighbors were concerned thinking 
their crops were going to be lost,
so they got Roundup Ready as well, and soon 
enough, Monsanto controlled the whole market.
And the control didn't end there.
As one seed grower from Ohio remembers it,  
Monsanto's salesman would tell 
people they could either sign on,
or they'd all be out of business 
within the next two years.
Monsanto was going to dominate 
the entire seed industry,
and there was nothing anybody could do about it.
So hundreds of thousands of farmers 
signed the deal, and it wasn't a good one.
One evening in late July of 2004,
an Indiana farmer named Dave Runyon was relaxing 
at home when two men knocked on his door.
They led me to believe that they 
were doing a survey for a magazine.
They wanted to know what kind of crops I planted.
They wanted to know what kind of herbicides I 
used, the seed I bought and purchased and used.
Runyon wasn't interested, so 
he decided to shut the door,  
when he heard one of the men 
say, "I think he's guilty."
Runyon didn't know what they 
meant, but a few months later,
he got a letter from Monsanto saying that he had  
seven days to turn over all of his 
business records to the company.
He was shocked, because Runyon was one of the few  
farmers that never signed 
a contract with Monsanto,
and yet here they were threatening 
to sue him for patent infringement.
Apparently, someone had tipped Monsanto off that 
Runyon had been replanting their seeds illegally,
and farmers all across the country 
were getting the same types of letters.
Honestly, it's kind of hard to overstate 
how much Monsanto tried to control farmers.
They sent private detectives and ex-cops 
to inspect farms all over the US,
waving their terms and conditions of the contract  
into farmers' faces to let 
them onto their property.
They hired plane and helicopter pilots to survey  
the farmlands from above 
for signs of infringement.
The lawsuits, the threats.
How could people possibly stand up to them?
And they even had a company hotline,  
1-800-ROUNDUP, that farmers could 
call to snitch on their neighbors.
It still exists.
1-800-ROUNDUP.
You're calling them now?
I think I got it right.
If you have information about the misuse of 
seed or a compliance issue, please press three.
That phone number was in existence in the 
same time that we're talking about there,  
where people could rat out their neighbor.
As Runyon himself puts it, "There is 
much mistrust in the countryside today.
You never know who might report on you.
You could actually willfully plant unauthorized  
seed in somebody's land if 
you want to destroy them."
Now, in 2010, Monsanto responded 
to farmers' concerns about these  
investigations and released a commitment 
statement regarding their patents.
They mentioned their pledge to 
transparency and ethical behavior,
properly introducing themselves 
with displayed identification,
and not exercising their patent rights when only  
trace amounts of their seed is 
present in a farmer's field.
While Monsanto ultimately ended 
up letting Runyon go, by 2013,  
they sued over 400 farmers, 
raking in over $20 million.
Many of these farmers went bankrupt,  
and countless others settled with Monsanto 
out of court even if they were innocent,
because they just couldn't risk the legal fees.
You know, they were actually 
influencing radio stations at one point,
and the radio stations would 
publicly say the name of the  
people who were saving Roundup seeds on air.
That sounds like a supervillain plot, really.
Yeah, well people actually started 
calling them Mon-satan, so...
This culture of fear and paranoia 
turned neighbors against each other,  
especially in communities where some farmers 
didn't wish to use Monsanto's herbicide system.
One of those farmers was Mike Wallace.
See, Mike had a field of soybean here that 
wasn't resistant to Monsanto's herbicide,
but his neighbor who was also growing 
soybean did use Monsanto's system.
Now, to be clear, this herbicide 
wasn't glyphosate itself, it was  
Monsanto's other herbicide product called Dicamba,
but it was still packaged in this 
Roundup and Roundup Ready system.
Now, one day Mike noticed that some of 
his soybean was dying, and he suspected  
it was the herbicide from the neighboring 
farm drifting over, killing his soybean,
and he could tell this was the 
case because the weeds underneath  
the neighbor's soybean were dying, 
allegedly because of the herbicide.
And he believed this caused him around 
a hundred thousand dollars in damages,  
but the neighbor denied that it was his fault.
Now, the tensions between the two farms grew,  
so Mike wanted to chat with one of the workers 
from the farm to discuss the situation.
They met on a country field road near both 
farms, and what happened next isn't really clear.
Things got sour quickly.
Allegedly, Mike grabbed the worker's arm, so 
the worker pulled back and pulled out his gun,
"shooting Wallace until the gun was empty".
Similar kinds of tragedies were 
happening all over the world.
Monsanto infiltrated farming communities in India, 
Argentina, Canada, Brazil, and even Vietnam.
By the 2010s, they were an 
almost untouchable monopoly.
Then out of the blue on March 20th 
2015, an independent science panel  
called the International Agency 
for Research on Cancer, or IARC,
came out with this,
a paper saying, "Glyphosate is 
probably carcinogenic to humans."
The most popular weed killer 
in the world may cause cancer.
IARC's classification of glyphosate 
as a probable carcinogen.
damage to chromosomes and DNA in human cells.
This came as a shock to 
everyone, especially Monsanto.
They don't know how IARC could 
reach a conclusion such as this one.
See, other big health organizations, like the 
US Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA,
and even the World Health Organization, which 
is actually the parent organization to IARC,
both claimed that glyphosate posed no 
carcinogenic risk to humans and animals.
I think the IARC designation took 
the public by such huge surprise,
because Monsanto had really done 
such a good job for 40-plus years  
convincing the world that this 
stuff was safer than table salt.
Monsanto was furious about this 
ruling, so on the same day,  
they sent a scathing letter to 
the World Health Organization
complaining how this classification 
needs to be rectified immediately.
They claimed IARC chose to 
disregard dozens of studies,
and that conclusions on 
glyphosate must be non-biased,  
thorough, and based on quality science.
Soon after, five review papers came out bashing  
the IARC classification and 
criticizing their decision.
So why would IARC disagree 
with all the other agencies,  
and why would they ignore so many studies?
Well, this is exactly the question California 
lawyer Brent Wisner wanted to answer.
Wisner had been looking into 
Monsanto for a while now.
Allegedly, Roundup was causing 
a decline in the bee population,  
so he thought he could make a case out of it.
But one day, one of Wisner's colleagues 
told him that her cousin-in-law had been  
using Roundup on his farm for 
as long as she could remember,
and then both he and his dog developed 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or NHL,  
a type of cancer targeting the lymphatic system,
and he died in late 2015.
He didn't stop using it until 
he was too weak to do anything.
He didn't think there was any danger with Roundup.
See, the IARC paper that came out saying 
glyphosate is a probable carcinogen  
actually pointed out that the strongest 
evidence was for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
And reports of Roundup users getting diagnosed 
with NHL were popping up more frequently.
This seemed like more than just a coincidence.
Wisner thought he had a case, but Monsanto was 
a corporate giant he couldn't tackle alone,
so he teamed up with other lawyers,  
and also an investigative journalist who'd 
been reporting on Monsanto for decades.
So there's a lot to write about.
I spent a lot of time at Monsanto headquarters.
It became pretty clear, "This company 
really doesn't care about its customers."
Right, okay.
Together, this group of lawyers 
started a lawsuit against Monsanto,  
and they forced them to hand 
over their company documents.
Monsanto had to comply, and 
so the lawyers got access to  
their internal emails, memos, and safety studies.
Saying one thing publicly and saying 
something completely different internally.
The duplicity, the deception, 
is just jaw-dropping, really.
In 1983, Monsanto submitted a glyphosate  
toxicology study to the EPA 
to get it classified as safe,
but the data was showing that mice receiving  
higher doses of glyphosate were 
developing rare kidney tumors.
The EPA was obviously worried with this,  
and they wanted to classify glyphosate 
as a possible human carcinogen.
So they asked Monsanto to do more studies.
And Monsanto fought back against that.
"No, you just need to trust 
what we're telling you.
You're reading the data 
wrong," et cetera et cetera.
Monsanto wouldn't comply, and they 
pushed back against the EPA until 1989,  
when the EPA suddenly changed its mind.
They said, "A repeat of the mouse oncogenicity 
will not be required at this time."
And instead, in 1991, the EPA classified  
glyphosate as having evidence of 
non-carcinogenicity for humans.
The cancer concern in mice was never made public,  
and this new classification 
certainly helped push Roundup sales,
at least until more independent research came in.
See, one of the most influential research papers 
on Roundup actually came out in the year 2000.
It was the Safety Evaluation and Risk 
Assessment of the Herbicide Roundup  
and its Active Ingredient Glyphosate for Humans,
commonly just called Williams, 
Kroes, and Munro after its authors.
This was the landmark paper on glyphosate safety,  
which concluded that Roundup herbicide 
does not pose a health risk to humans.
This paper was cited over 
1200 times, which is a lot.
And it was considered then by regulators 
of the foundational research paper to say  
that glyphosate was safe, this independent paper.
Except the paper wasn't independent at all.
See, Monsanto's director of the 
toxicology group, William Heydens,
was listed on the paper as someone 
who provided scientific support.
So in a 2017 deposition, Wisner and his fellow 
lawyers decided to ask Heydens about it.
Were your contributions in your view 
to the Williams paper substantial?
No, they were not.
As I said, they were editorial, 
just to make it easier to read.
But here's how Heydens referred to his 
involvement in the paper internally.
"I have sprouted several new gray hairs 
during the writing of this thing,"
or "I'll strangle Kroes or Williams 
if they ask for any rewrites!!"
And much later, "We would be keeping 
the cost down by us doing the writing  
and they would just edit and 
sign their names, so to speak.
Recall that is how we handled 
Williams Kroes and Munro."
And they celebrated when it was finally done.
You see in their internal documents,  
they talk about how this is going to be 
our defense, glyphosate around the world.
The patterns of Monsanto's manipulation 
were just popping up everywhere.
They tried to change glyphosate cancer 
classifications at different agencies.
They seemingly colluded with corrupt EPA 
officials to try and kill opposing research.
And they ghost-wrote safety studies.
By mid 2017, Wisner released all of 
these internal documents to the public,  
now known as the Monsanto Papers.
People were furious.
Newly released docs show Monsanto executives 
colluding with corrupted EPA officials.
Would try to influence media and science reports.
Monsanto appears to have been caught red-handed.
We have a paper trail that goes back to the 1980s.
Stakes for Monsanto are extremely high.
Soon, lawyers were overwhelmed 
with calls from cancer patients  
who used Roundup and got diagnosed with NHL.
They wished to be included in the lawsuit.
By the end of the year, more than 
3000 victims had signed onto the case.
But Monsanto tried to do everything 
to dismantle these carcinogen claims.
You remember the five independent papers that  
came out bashing the IARC decision to 
call glyphosate a probable carcinogen?
Well, the main review article 
there was ghostwritten by Monsanto.
So you could see this paper getting edited 
and changed by people who worked for Monsanto.
And it has been frustrating 
to see journals basically  
at every step of the way declining to retract.
That paper is still online today, 
and Monsanto went all the way to  
discredit anyone who is opposing their view
with something called their 
'Let Nothing Go' Strategy.
Let Nothing Go is essentially 
like, let nothing go.
Somebody tweets online, Roundup 
causes cancer, you don't let that go.
You have an onslaught of 
people responding to that.
They had whole training operations where 
they would bring in nutritionists and  
academics and other people to train 
them what to say and how to say it.
I do not believe that glyphosate in 
Argentina is causing increases in cancer.
You can drink a whole quart 
of it and it won't hurt you.
You want to drink some?
We have some here.
I'd be happy to actually.
But not really.
Not really?
I know it wouldn't hurt me.
I mean, if you say so, I have some glyphosate.
No, no, I'm not stupid.
But they very much became 
an army that Monsanto could  
deploy when a news article came out, for instance.
Are we going to get some comments under this 
video that are actually written by Monsanto?
I wouldn't be surprised.
But all of the confusion Monsanto tried 
to create around glyphosate wasn't enough.
By the summer of 2018, the truth was out and over 
11,000 plaintiffs filed lawsuits against Monsanto.
This was going to destroy them.
But unfortunately, Monsanto had an escape plan.
Just as the first lawsuit 
against them was starting,
they signed an acquisition deal 
with German chemical giant, Bayer.
Monsanto cashed in, the executives rode off into 
the sunset, and Bayer was left holding the bag.
Why would Bayer buy Monsanto?
If it's so obvious that they have hundreds of 
thousands of plaintiffs waiting for a verdict,
why would a company do something like that?
Well, I think that's the big question that 
the investors are asking, or have asked.
Why in God's name did you do this?
Why did you do this?
I think it was Wall Street 
Journal that had a headline,  
Worst Acquisition in History, 
or something like that.
Bayer stock tanked immediately after the 
acquisition, and things only got worse for them.
A few months later, the first case against 
the Monsanto-Bayer company went to trial.
The plaintiff was Dewayne Lee Johnson,
who had developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma after 
accidentally getting doused with Roundup at work.
The jury faced with evidence from the 
Monsanto Papers sided with Johnson,
awarding him $289 million in 
damages, and Bayer had to pay up.
By 2025, Bayer had to settle 
more than a hundred thousand  
cancer lawsuits for the damages 
caused by Monsanto's Roundup,
amounting to over $10 billion in settlements.
Monsanto, which is now owned by 
Germany's Bayer, denies any wrongdoing.
And they don't accept that Roundup could 
have caused the plaintiffs' cancer.
So after all this publicity and scandal, 
how dangerous is Roundup really?
My question has always been,
if it doesn't cause cancer and it's not dangerous 
and there's no real risk to human health,
why in God's name would Monsanto have to spend  
millions and millions and millions of 
dollars to create ghostwritten studies,
and hire PR companies to 
ghostwrite articles online?
And why would you have to engage in so much 
deception if you truly had a safe product, right?
Well, according to IARC, one of the biggest 
concerns with glyphosate is genotoxicity.
Some studies have shown that if 
you get overexposed to glyphosate,  
like many farmers would,
then the chemical might substantially 
damage the DNA in your cells,  
which is a common mechanism of 
action for many carcinogens.
And other studies have actually 
pointed to the shikimate pathway.
Again, we don't use it, but 
the bacteria in our gut do.
So if you ingest trace amounts of glyphosate,  
for example, through your food, it 
could disrupt your gut's microbiome.
If you can disrupt the enzyme 
in the microflora in your gut,  
the EPSP enzyme, the synthase, it 
could have all sorts of effects.
Now, IARC never specified at what dose 
glyphosate actually becomes dangerous.
Just that overall glyphosate 
is a probable carcinogen.
And to put it into context, the other things 
in the same classification category are  
eating red meat or high temperature 
frying or pulling a night shift.
But these are lower than the number one 
category, which is a certain carcinogen.
And here of course you have 
alcohol and tobacco and sunlight.
And to give you context from our 
previous episode on Forever Chemicals,
PFOA was a category one, so a certain carcinogen,
but PFOS is actually a category 2B, which is lower 
than glyphosate at only a possible carcinogen.
From the data I've seen, glyphosate doesn't 
seem to be a particularly potent carcinogen,
but high exposure to glyphosate 
is certainly associated with a  
modest increase in your ability 
to get certain types of cancers.
And people who have higher exposures 
are clearly at higher risk.
Yeah.
However, the EPA and many other organizations 
like the European Food Safety Authority still  
disagree with the IARC and claim that 
glyphosate isn't a likely carcinogen.
But the courts in the United 
States have repeatedly told  
the EPA that they're not doing a proper analysis,
they're not doing a proper assessment of 
glyphosate, they're not following their own rules.
You said something like 50% of the 
papers that were about glyphosate  
safety and research and toxicity 
were probably industry funded.
Yeah, that's just a guess off the top of my head.
Honestly, it could be much higher than 50%.
I certainly do not think it's lower than that.
There's just always a desire by these 
companies to control the science.
Today, Bayer still denies that 
glyphosate is a carcinogen.
They would still tell you, they don't 
think there's anything wrong with it.
Yeah.
When my book came out, Bayer reached 
out to me, they sent me an email.
And it was really kind of quite strange.
It was like, "Congratulations.
We've read your book and we've learned 
a lot." I think Bayer feels different.
And Bayer actually removed 
glyphosate from commercial products.
So this bottle of Roundup here doesn't 
even have glyphosate in it anymore.
Part of the reason for that must be 
the public backlash and the lawsuits,  
but the other reason is that it 
doesn't work that well anymore.
We overused glyphosate.
See, since the 1970s, more than 60 species 
of weed have become resistant to glyphosate,  
just like that first salmonella 
sample found near the factory.
What do they put in those Roundup 
sprays, if not glyphosate?
Well, mostly full circle, so it's 2,4-D.
Isn't that crazy?
Well, you know, many people will probably go  
through life not being affected 
in the slightest by glyphosate.
But others may develop cancer or other disease,
and that's why it's really important to 
protect the most sensitive individuals.
I think another part of the problem here is how  
a company as big as Monsanto 
can just infiltrate academia.
They have these big resources so they can just 
push around scientists and manipulate results.
They create so much confusion, and 
then they just avoid the punishment.
When you don't create firewalls between 
the regulated and the regulators,
you have created distrust in science.
Inherently, science is 
always going to be political.
It's never going to be disconnected 
from the realities of the world,  
it's always socially constructed.
But we can do a lot of things to put 
rules and regulations in place to try  
and make sure that there's a better sense of 
independence and disconnection between this.
I want to shout out two books, Carey Gillam's 'The 
Monsanto Papers' and Bart Elmore's 'Seed Money'.
They were both incredibly valuable 
in researching this topic.
And I also want to shout out people 
in the comments of our previous video  
on PFAS suggesting that we should cover Monsanto.
Thank you for suggesting that idea.
And thank you as always for watching.
