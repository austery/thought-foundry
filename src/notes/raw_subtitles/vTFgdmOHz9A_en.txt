>> Let's
 head
 back
 to
 the
 Screen
 Time
 main


stage,
 the
 theater
 here
 at
 Screen
 Time.


And
 to
 Adam
 Msari,
 he's
 the
 head
 of


Instagram
 over
 at
 Meta
 Platforms.
 He's


speaking
 with
 Bloomberg
 News's
 Kurt


Wagner.


>> Mr.
 Beast,
 everyone
 in
 this
 audience


already
 knows
 who
 that
 is.
 I
 don't
 need


to
 explain
 who
 Mr.
 Beast
 is.
 He
 posted


actually
 on
 Threads.
 this
 was
 his


threads
 post
 which
 is
 also
 your


platform.


>> Yeah.


>> That
 it's
 scary
 times
 for
 creators


because
 of
 these
 Gen
 AI
 tools
 that
 are


coming
 out.


>> Um
 what
 do
 you
 think?
 Should
 should


creators
 be
 scared?
 Is
 this
 scary
 times?


I
 think
 things
 are
 changing
 really


quickly
 and
 I
 think
 that
 means
 that
 a


lot
 of
 us
 whether
 you're
 using
 a


platform
 like
 Jimmy
 is
 or
 you're


building
 a
 platform
 like
 we
 do
 on
 our


team
 are
 having
 to
 think
 about
 how
 we


need
 to
 evolve
 how
 we
 do
 what
 we
 do.
 Uh


the
 jobs
 are
 changing
 and
 so
 I
 don't


think
 that
 technology
 from
 the
 creator


side
 is
 going
 to
 replace
 creativity.
 I


think
 it's
 going
 to
 change
 who
 can
 be


creative.
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 change


how
 people
 tell
 their
 stories.
 But
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 I
 think
 that
 people


have
 creators
 and
 creatives,
 they
 have


their
 taste,
 they
 have
 their
 processes,


they
 have
 their
 judgments,
 they
 have


their
 cultural
 commentary,
 and
 they're


going
 to
 use
 those
 in
 different
 ways


than
 before.
 Because
 to
 produce
 a
 video


isn't
 going
 to
 require
 what
 Jimmy
 has


historically
 done
 with
 Mr.
 Beast
 and


these
 huge
 sets
 and
 these
 amazing


elaborate
 production
 teams.
 uh
 it's


going
 to
 be
 something
 that
 anybody
 can


do
 um
 with
 access
 to
 the
 right
 model.


>> Right?
 So
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 it
 will
 make


certain
 things
 easier.
 It
 will
 lower
 the


bar
 for
 what
 it
 takes
 to
 you
 know


produce
 maybe
 something
 that
 feels


highly
 um
 like
 produced.
 Does
 this
 uh


create
 more
 creators?
 Does
 this
 create
 a


a
 upper
 crust
 of
 creators?
 You
 know
 um


because
 there's
 now
 so
 many
 more
 people


who
 can
 do
 this.
 I
 think
 it'll
 mean
 that


today's
 creators,
 if
 they
 lean
 into
 the


tools,
 or
 the
 ones
 who
 do,
 will
 be
 able


to
 create
 more
 or
 even
 better
 content.


But
 I
 think
 it
 also
 means
 that
 they're


going
 to
 be
 people
 who
 couldn't
 be


creators
 before
 who
 can
 now
 actually


produce
 content
 of
 a
 certain
 quality
 or


at
 a
 certain
 scale.
 But
 it
 also
 means


they're
 going
 to
 be
 bad
 actors
 who
 try


to
 leverage
 these
 technologies
 for,
 you


know,
 nefarious
 purposes
 as
 well.
 So


yeah,


>> it's
 going
 to
 be


>> well,
 if
 you
 take
 a
 big
 step
 back,
 the


what
 the
 internet
 did,
 among
 other


things,
 was
 allow
 almost
 anyone
 to


become
 a
 publisher
 by
 reducing
 the
 cost


of
 distributing
 content
 to
 essentially


zero.
 And
 what
 some
 of
 these
 generative


AI
 models
 look
 like
 they're
 going to
 do


is
 they're
 going
 to
 reduce
 the
 cost
 of


producing
 content


>> Yeah.


>> to
 basically
 zero.
 So
 that
 will
 be
 a


multiplier
 effect
 on
 the
 things
 that


we're
 already
 seeing,
 which
 is
 that


there's
 more
 people
 producing
 more


content
 and
 reaching
 more
 people.
 Uh,


and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 and
 bad
 that


comes
 downstream
 from
 that.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 as
 someone
 who
 creates
 an


algorithm
 intended
 to
 show
 people
 things


that
 they
 want
 to
 see,
 do
 you
 anticipate


I
 don't know
 if
 you
 can
 break
 down
 what


the
 the
 average
 person
 is
 seeing
 right


now
 in
 terms
 of
 stuff
 that's
 AI


generated
 versus,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 more


traditional
 human
 generated.
 But
 what's


that
 going
 to
 look
 like
 in
 a
 year
 or
 in


five
 years?
 Are
 we
 going
 to
 be
 seeing
 a


feed
 just
 full
 of
 AI
 stuff
 or
 is
 there
 a


human
 element
 that's
 going
 to
 be


important
 here?


>> Well,
 well,
 today
 on
 the
 big
 platforms


like
 Instagram
 and
 Tik
 Tok
 and
 Facebook


and
 YouTube,
 I
 think
 there's
 actually
 a


lot
 of
 hybrid
 content
 and
 too
 often
 we


talk
 about
 synthetic
 content
 and
 organic


content
 and
 never
 the
 two
 shall
 meet.


But
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 content
 where
 AI
 is


part
 of
 the
 workflow,
 right?
 Like
 you


might
 not
 even
 know
 it.
 you
 might
 it


might
 be
 whatever
 app
 you're
 using
 to
 do


color
 correction
 might
 be
 using
 models


to
 do
 so.
 Um
 you
 know
 stamp
 tool
 in


Photoshop
 in
 the
 old
 days
 to
 get
 rid
 of


a
 pimple
 those
 types
 of
 things.
 Um
 but


that
 line
 is
 going
 to
 be
 more
 and
 more


blurred.
 Uh
 so
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 little


bit
 less
 like
 what
 is
 organic
 content


and
 what
 is
 AI
 synthetic
 content
 and


what
 the
 percentages
 are.
 I
 think


there's
 going to
 be
 actually
 more
 in
 the


middle
 than
 pure
 synthetic
 content
 for
 a


while.
 But
 you
 will
 also
 see
 experiences


that
 are
 purely
 AI,
 right?
 You
 see
 this


in
 the
 last
 two
 weeks
 with
 vibes
 in
 the


metai
 app
 and
 with
 Sora
 2
 from
 OpenAI.


Uh
 so
 I
 think
 you're
 going to
 see
 both.


>> You
 mentioned
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 potential


for
 bad
 actors
 out
 there.
 Uh
 we
 talked
 a


few
 weeks
 ago
 actually
 Instagram


announced
 three
 billion
 users.
 Um
 and
 we


had
 a
 conversation
 then
 and
 one
 of
 the


things
 you
 said
 was
 you
 know
 you
 rely


especially
 with
 AI
 on
 on
 a
 lot
 of


self-reporting.
 people
 have
 to
 sort
 of


let
 their
 audience
 know
 I
 used
 AI
 for


this.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 don't
 do
 that.
 Um


I'm
 curious
 what
 responsibility
 you


think
 Instagram
 and
 Meta
 have
 versus
 how


much
 of
 it
 is
 on
 the
 content
 creator


themselves.
 Like
 do
 you
 need
 to
 be


identifying
 that
 something
 is
 AI
 and


alerting
 the
 audience
 to
 it
 or
 is
 it
 all


on
 the
 creator?


>> I
 think
 that
 we
 can
 do
 more
 to
 identify


content
 that
 was
 created
 with
 AI.
 We


actually
 when
 we
 first
 did
 it,
 we
 were


doing
 we
 were
 using
 the
 XF
 data
 and
 a


bunch
 of
 people
 got
 mad
 at
 us
 because


Photoshop
 was
 exporting
 content
 and
 AI


was
 part
 of
 the
 flow
 and
 then
 we
 were


saying
 it
 was
 AI
 content
 but
 the
 creator


was
 like
 this
 isn't
 AI
 content
 but
 if


you
 actually
 looked
 at
 how
 the
 flow
 was


made


>> like
 they
 were
 they
 thought
 Photoshop


was
 AI
 or


>> they
 had
 used
 some
 tool
 in
 Photoshop


that
 triggered
 that.
 Okay,


>> I
 think
 it
 was
 Photoshop
 or
 maybe
 it
 was


Premiere.
 I
 forget
 which
 app.


>> Um
 so
 it's
 sort
 of
 a
 delicate
 matter.


For
 what
 it's
 worth
 though,
 I
 think
 that


trying
 to
 automatically
 label
 everything


that
 was
 created
 in
 some
 part
 with
 AI,


particularly
 when
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


hybrid
 content
 where
 it's
 only
 part
 of


the
 process,
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 it's
 not


a
 fool's
 errand,
 but
 it's
 it's
 maybe
 the


wrong
 focus.
 I
 think
 what's
 going
 to


happen
 quickly
 is
 that
 you
 can
 still


kind
 of
 tell
 when
 content
 was
 created
 by


AI.
 Not
 always,
 but
 usually
 pretty
 good.


It's
 it's
 hard
 harder.
 It's
 getting


harder
 and
 I
 think
 pretty
 soon
 it'll
 be


almost
 impossible.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so
 I
 think
 what
 we
 need
 to
 do
 is


sure
 we
 can
 work
 more
 on
 labeling,
 but


we
 also
 need
 to
 provide


more
 context
 for
 people
 to
 make
 more


informed
 decisions
 about
 what
 to
 believe


and
 to
 not.
 So
 like
 the
 way
 you
 think


about,
 you
 know,
 literacy
 for
 like
 my


kids,
 my
 kids
 are
 young.
 They're
 97
 and


five.
 I
 need
 them
 to
 understand
 as
 they


grow
 up
 and
 they
 get
 exposed
 to
 the


internet
 that
 just
 because
 they're


seeing
 a
 video
 of
 something
 doesn't
 mean


it
 actually
 happened
 and
 they
 when
 I


grew
 up
 and
 I
 saw
 a
 video
 I
 could
 assume


that
 that
 was
 a
 capture
 of
 a
 moment
 that


happened
 in
 the
 real
 world.
 And
 what


they're
 going
 to
 need
 to
 do
 is
 they're


going
 to
 need
 to
 think
 about
 who
 is


saying
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> Who's
 sharing
 it
 in
 this
 case?
 And
 what


are
 their
 incentives
 and
 why
 might
 they


be
 saying
 it?
 And
 there's
 going
 to
 be


way
 more
 importance
 if
 you're
 going
 to


make
 good
 decisions
 about
 what
 to
 trust


and
 what
 to
 allow
 to
 inform
 your
 own


opinions.
 Uh
 this
 is
 we're
 going
 to
 have


to
 shift
 emphasis
 away
 from
 the
 content


itself.
 Uh
 and
 not
 to
 ignore
 it,
 but


just
 away
 from
 it
 and
 put
 more
 on
 who's


saying
 it
 and
 why
 they
 might
 be
 saying


it.


>> Yeah.
 But
 you're
 doing
 that
 as
 a
 as
 a
 an


involved
 parent.


>> But
 as
 a
 platform,
 we
 can
 provide


context
 too,
 right?
 Like
 and
 we
 do


today,
 but
 we
 can
 do
 more.
 Like
 today,


if
 you
 go
 to
 my
 profile,
 you
 can
 go
 to


about
 this
 profile.
 You
 can
 see
 how
 long


I've
 had
 this
 profile,
 what
 country
 I'm


based
 in,
 how
 many
 times
 I've
 changed
 my


username,
 a
 series
 of
 signals
 that
 you


can
 use
 to
 decide
 how
 much
 you
 want
 to


trust
 or
 not
 trust,
 or
 maybe
 it's
 not


even
 about
 positive
 and
 negative.
 Maybe


it's
 just
 about
 my
 political
 bias
 or
 my


financial
 bias
 or
 any
 other
 kind
 of
 bias


I
 might.


>> Yeah,
 it
 feels
 like
 it's
 evolving.


Obviously,
 um
 the
 Instagram
 app
 is


evolving
 as
 well.
 That
 was
 a
 big
 part
 of


our
 last
 conversation.
 I
 think
 people


still
 think
 of


>> I
 shouldn't
 say
 I
 I
 certainly
 still
 part


of
 me
 thinks
 of
 Instagram
 as
 this
 feed


of
 of
 beautiful
 curated
 photos
 and


videos
 like
 that
 is
 maybe
 um
 it's


certainly
 an
 older
 way
 of
 thinking
 about


it.
 You're
 leaning
 very
 hard
 into
 this


sort
 of
 newer
 version
 of
 Instagram
 which


is
 DMs,
 stories,
 reels.
 Walk
 us
 through


a
 little
 bit
 about
 where
 your
 priorities


are
 with
 Instagram
 right
 now.
 like
 is


the
 the
 traditional
 feed
 a
 thing
 of
 the


past
 at
 this
 point?


>> It's
 certainly
 changing.
 The
 all
 the


growth
 in
 Instagram
 over
 the
 last
 5


years
 or
 more
 have
 really
 has
 really


come
 from
 DMs
 and
 reals
 and


recommendations
 and
 stories.
 Uh
 but
 we


started
 as
 a
 feed
 of
 hypersaturated


photos,
 you
 know,
 glossy
 landscapes.
 You


guys
 can
 all
 sort
 of
 picture
 the


aesthetic
 and
 that's
 just
 not
 how
 people


use
 Instagram
 anymore.
 Um,
 our
 biggest


risk
 is
 that
 the
 world
 evolves.
 We
 don't


keep
 up
 and
 we
 just
 become
 irrelevant.


If
 we
 hadn't
 built
 DMs
 and
 stories
 and


reels,
 you
 wouldn't
 be
 interviewing
 me


on
 stage
 today.
 We
 wouldn't
 be
 relevant


relevant
 enough
 to
 show
 up
 at
 screen


time.


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 but
 moving
 it
 forward
 is
 also


tricky.
 People
 get
 frustrated
 when
 you


have
 an
 when
 they
 have
 an
 experience


that
 they
 use
 for
 call
 it
 half
 an
 hour
 a


day
 and
 then
 someone
 comes
 and
 changes


it
 without
 asking
 them.
 So,
 it's
 a


balance.
 But
 but
 we
 have
 to
 because
 if


we
 didn't
 um
 we
 would
 be
 in
 trouble.
 I


mean
 like
 I'll
 do
 like
 probably


shouldn't
 do
 this
 cuz
 nobody
 can
 see
 the


audience
 on
 camera.
 But
 how
 many
 of
 you


use
 Instagram?
 It's
 okay
 if
 you
 don't.


Raise
 your
 hand
 really
 high
 so
 I
 can


see.
 Cool.
 How
 many
 of
 you
 keep
 your


hand
 up
 have
 messaged
 someone
 in
 the


last
 two
 days?


Great.
 How
 many
 Now
 how
 many
 of
 you
 have


posted
 a
 story
 in
 the
 last
 couple
 days?


All right.
 So
 maybe
 about
 half
 from


about
 it
 was
 like
 80%.
 How
 many
 of
 you


posted
 something
 to
 feed
 in
 the
 last
 two


days?


>> For
 those
 watching,
 that
 the
 number
 of


hands
 is
 very
 minimal.


>> We
 have
 seven.


>> We
 went
 from
 like
 almost
 everybody
 to


seven.
 Yeah,


>> that's
 how
 Instagram
 is
 used.
 Um,
 we


connect
 with
 friends,
 we
 explore
 our


interests,
 but
 we
 do
 so
 by
 seeing
 a
 real


and
 sending
 it
 to
 someone
 who
 we
 think


might
 enjoy
 it
 or
 responding
 to
 a
 story


or
 sharing
 a
 fleeting
 moment
 or
 posting


a
 note.
 actually
 if
 you're,
 you
 know,


younger
 than
 I
 am.


>> Um,
 it's
 posting
 to
 your
 feed
 is
 just


not
 the
 primary
 way
 people
 express


themselves.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that's
 evidenced
 by
 some
 of


the
 stuff
 you're
 doing.
 So,
 I
 want
 to


get
 into
 this
 sort
 of
 uh
 test
 you're


doing
 with
 reals.
 Um,
 you
 launch
 an
 iPad


app,
 which
 people
 have
 been
 clamoring


for
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 If
 you
 the
 iPad
 app


opens
 directly
 into
 reels,
 so
 it
 doesn't


open
 into
 the
 traditional
 feed.
 You're


now
 kicked
 into
 this
 short
 form
 video
 uh


experience.
 You're
 testing
 that
 in
 India


as
 well.
 Yeah.


>> Is
 this
 the
 future?
 Like
 a
 year
 from


now,
 are
 we
 all
 going
 to
 open
 up


Instagram
 and
 instead
 of
 seeing
 that


that
 feed,
 are
 we
 just
 going
 to
 be


kicked
 into,
 you
 know,
 what
 maybe
 feels


like
 Tik
 Tok?


>> So
 when
 you
 Yeah.
 So
 the
 test
 in
 India


right
 now
 is
 an
 opt-in
 and
 it
 opens,
 you


have
 stories
 at
 the
 top
 still,
 but
 if


you
 scroll
 down,
 it
 scrolls
 into
 uh


reals.
 But
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 reels
 tab


and
 the
 main
 feed
 tab,
 there
 are
 two


primary
 differences


there.
 One
 is
 full
 screen
 media
 at
 a


time.
 So
 you
 see
 one
 piece,
 one
 photo
 or


video
 at
 a
 time.
 Um,
 and
 that
 is
 the


reals
 tab
 whereas
 feed
 is
 free


scrolling.
 And
 then
 reals
 has
 more


videos
 um,
 and
 more
 recommendations
 and


feed
 has
 less.
 But
 they
 both
 have


recommendations.
 They
 both
 have
 photos.


They
 both
 have
 carousels
 and
 they
 both


have
 videos.
 It's
 just
 a
 balance.
 And
 so


it's
 really
 a
 design
 difference
 and
 then


a
 ranking
 difference.
 I
 think
 just


swapping
 them
 doesn't
 really
 make
 sense.


But
 I
 think
 that
 if
 a
 more
 immersive


media
 is
 really
 driving
 all
 our
 growth,


if
 we
 can
 figure
 out
 a
 way
 to
 transition


the
 app
 to
 that
 being
 the
 experience


that
 you
 swipe
 into,
 then
 that
 would


probably
 be
 a
 good
 thing
 if
 we
 can
 make


it
 happen.
 The
 question
 is,
 can
 we
 make


it
 happen
 responsibly
 without,
 you
 know,


pissing
 everybody
 off,
 without
 really


hurting
 the
 business
 because
 the


monetization
 efficiency
 of
 video
 is


lower
 by
 finding
 the
 right
 balance.
 It's


probably
 not
 ranked
 exactly
 as
 one
 is
 or


the
 other
 is
 today.
 Um
 but
 that
 is


definitely
 something
 I
 want
 to
 explore.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 from
 the
 outside
 it's
 hard


not
 to
 look
 at
 that
 and
 think
 Tik
 Tok


Tik
 Tok
 is
 driving
 this
 change
 for
 you.


How
 much
 do
 you
 think
 about
 Tik
 Tok
 um


as
 a
 it's
 obviously
 a
 major
 competitor


but
 I'm
 wondering
 how
 much
 something


like
 this
 um
 is
 driven
 maybe
 by
 what


you're
 seeing
 from
 competition.


>> Curious
 about
 this
 data.
 What
 is
 this


data?
 Adults
 18
 to
 34
 average
 audience


by
 hour.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 that
 means.


Cool.
 Um
 definitely
 think
 about
 Tik
 Tok,


definitely
 think
 about
 YouTube,


definitely
 think
 about
 Snapchat.
 Um
 I


mean
 the
 immersive
 viewer
 is
 predates


Tik
 Tok,
 right?
 I
 think
 Cacao
 stories


pioneered
 the
 stories
 format
 which
 was


an
 immersive
 viewer
 in
 Korea.
 It
 was


popularized
 by
 Snapchat
 worldwide.
 So


they
 should
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 credit
 for


that.
 Tik
 Tok
 was
 applying
 that


immersive
 viewer,
 that
 native
 first


experience
 to
 short
 form
 video
 and
 they


should
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 credit
 for
 that.
 And


now
 obviously
 you've
 got
 YouTube
 shorts,


Instagram
 reels,
 Facebook
 reels
 and
 the


rest
 of
 it.
 We
 think
 a
 lot
 about
 Tik
 Tok


because
 they
 are
 really
 good
 at
 what


they
 do.
 Um
 they
 are
 better
 than
 I
 think


the
 rest
 of
 the
 industry
 at
 this
 point


at
 a
 couple
 things.
 Um
 at
 breaking
 new


talent
 um
 at


>> as
 in
 like
 identifying
 up
 and
 cominging


creators.
 Is
 that
 what
 you
 mean?


>> Yeah.
 So
 if
 you
 the
 way
 it
 works
 is
 when


you're
 ranking
 content
 and
 you
 want
 to


drive
 engagement,
 it's
 easier
 to
 drive


engagement
 by
 showing
 content
 that
 you


know
 lots
 of
 people
 like
 than
 to
 try
 and


discover
 content
 that
 you
 might
 love


that
 you
 didn't
 even
 know
 about
 yet
 that


might
 be
 from
 a
 really
 small
 name
 or
 a


small
 creator.
 And
 that's
 called


exploration
 based
 ranking
 when
 you
 try


to
 literally
 almost
 test
 out
 things
 to


see
 if
 they
 have
 legs
 if
 if
 there's
 an


audience
 for
 them.
 Um,
 they
 are
 really


good
 at
 exploration
 based
 ranking.
 We're


closing
 that
 gap.
 Um,
 but
 we're
 not
 all


the
 way
 there
 yet.
 YouTube
 isn't


actually
 great
 at
 that.
 YouTube
 is
 the


best,
 I
 think,
 in
 the
 market
 at
 paying


out
 creators
 through
 revshare
 and
 ads.


>> That's
 cuz
 they're
 still
 mostly
 long


form.
 And
 long
 form,
 they've
 done
 a


really
 good
 job
 with
 their
 in
 in
 or


their
 pre-rolls
 and
 their
 mid
 rolls.


>> Um,
 but
 I
 think
 Tik
 Tok
 has
 been
 like


really
 culturally
 relevant
 because


they've
 been
 able
 to
 break
 small
 names.


They've
 been
 really
 timely,
 so
 trends


happen
 really
 quickly,
 and
 they've
 just


been
 reliably
 really
 fun
 and


entertaining.


>> Yeah,
 there's
 obviously,
 I'm
 sure
 um


you've
 followed,
 there's
 a
 deal
 now,
 a


proposed
 deal
 for
 Tik
 Tok
 to
 stay
 in
 the


United
 States.
 It's
 kind
 of
 unique


because
 it
 calls
 for
 the
 US
 government


to
 be
 somewhat
 involved
 in,
 you
 know,
 if


not
 managing
 at
 least
 um
 overseeing
 this


new
 US
 Tik
 Tok.
 Does
 this
 worry
 you
 at


all?
 Like
 that
 the
 US
 government
 might


perhaps
 have
 an
 incentive
 for
 for
 Tik


Tok
 to
 do
 better
 than
 Instagram?


>> You
 should
 be
 careful
 with
 my
 words.


>> Um,


>> we're
 all
 friends
 here.
 You're
 welcome


to
 say
 whatever
 you
 want.


>> What
 could
 go
 wrong?


>> Yeah.


>> Uh,
 I'll
 say
 a
 few
 things.
 Uh,
 I
 one,
 I


do
 think
 it's
 good
 that
 Tik
 Tok
 is
 still


going
 to
 be
 in
 the
 US.
 It
 would


certainly
 make
 our
 lives
 easier
 on
 the


professional
 side
 to
 have
 less


competition,
 but
 I
 think
 competition
 is


fundamentally
 healthy.
 They've
 pushed
 us


to
 do
 better
 work.
 I
 think
 it's
 good
 for


the
 consumer
 and
 it's
 good
 for


competition.
 So,
 I'm
 glad
 that
 they're


still
 going
 to
 be
 around.
 On
 the


specifics
 of
 the
 deal,
 it
 just
 seems
 all


very


hard
 to
 parse
 there.
 It
 looks
 like
 more


or
 less


there's
 an
 bit
 of
 an
 ownership
 and
 a


revshare
 change
 but
 not
 an
 actual
 real


change
 in
 how
 it's
 built.
 Uh
 and
 in
 you


know
 cuz
 you
 know
 bite
 dance
 and
 Tik
 Tok


share
 code
 historically
 most
 of
 the
 most


the
 strongest
 ranking
 work
 has
 come
 out


of
 China


>> the
 like
 I
 don't
 see
 anything
 that


suggests
 that
 any
 of
 how
 it's
 actually


built
 is
 going
 to
 meaningfully
 change.


Okay.
 It
 just
 seems
 like
 an
 ownership


stake
 and
 a
 revshare


going
 that's
 split
 between
 obviously


Bite
 Dance
 and
 the
 new
 owners
 here.
 Um,


but
 it's
 the
 same
 app,
 the
 same
 ranking


system,
 you
 know,
 the
 same
 creators.


You're
 following
 the
 same
 people.
 It
 all


sort
 of
 sort
 of
 seamless.
 So,
 it
 seems
 a


little
 bit


>> hard
 to
 I'm
 not
 sure
 what
 to
 make
 of


that.
 It
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 it's
 a
 major


change.
 In
 terms
 of
 incentives,
 yeah,
 I


mean,
 we
 always
 want
 to
 be
 considered.


We
 always
 want
 to
 consider
 all
 the


incentives
 of
 the
 most
 relevant
 parties


involved.
 Um,
 but
 I
 just
 want
 to
 stay


focused
 on
 how
 do
 we
 make
 sure
 Instagram


does
 a
 great
 job
 where
 they're
 better


than
 us.
 How
 do
 we
 catch
 up
 where
 we


think
 we've
 got
 a
 competitive
 advantage?


How
 do
 we
 double
 down?
 Um,
 and
 how
 do
 we


keep
 moving
 forward
 and
 trying
 to
 make


Instagram
 as
 valuable
 as
 possible
 for


people?
 Um,
 and
 then
 try
 not
 to
 get
 too


sucked
 into
 the
 noise
 of
 the
 of
 the


drama
 of
 the
 week.


>> We
 may
 be
 supporting
 your
 direct


competitors,
 all
 that
 stuff.


>> We
 think
 about
 it,
 but
 we
 try
 to
 focus


on
 what
 we
 can
 control
 and
 spend
 less


time
 on
 what
 we
 cannot.


>> Um,
 we
 only
 have
 a
 few
 more
 minutes.


This
 always
 flies
 by.


>> Um,


>> there
 was
 a
 report
 that
 you
 guys
 are


building
 a
 TV
 app.
 Are
 you
 building
 a
 TV


app?


>> Let's
 make
 some
 news.
 This
 is
 it.


>> We're
 exploring
 TV.
 TV
 is
 an


increasingly
 important
 um
 surface.
 It's


been
 very
 important
 for
 YouTube.
 Neil's


talked
 about
 that
 publicly,
 the
 CEO


there.
 It's
 been
 very
 important
 for
 Tik


Tok.
 Uh
 so,
 we'd
 like
 to
 figure
 out
 how


to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 have
 uh
 we
 we
 show


up
 in
 a
 compelling
 way
 on
 all
 the


relevant
 devices.
 So,
 we're
 definitely


exploring
 it,
 but
 nothing
 to
 announce


today.


>> Unfortunately,


>> why
 now
 though?
 Why
 explore
 it
 now


versus
 a
 few
 years
 ago?
 It's
 because
 as


you
 point
 out,


>> I
 wish
 we
 had
 explored
 it
 a
 few
 years.


>> Okay.
 Why
 didn't
 you


We've
 been
 busy.
 Um


it
 seems
 like
 every
 year
 is
 a
 little
 bit


more
 intense
 and
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 wild.


Um
 I
 I
 see
 that
 as
 a
 mistake
 though
 on


my
 part.
 So
 I
 I'll
 take
 ownership
 for


that.
 Um
 I
 you
 know
 we've
 been
 focusing


a
 lot
 on
 ranking.
 We've
 been
 focusing
 a


lot
 on
 evolving
 the
 experience
 forward.


We've
 been
 focusing
 a
 lot
 on
 safety
 and


parents.
 We've
 been
 focusing
 a
 lot
 on


just
 compliance.
 Um,
 like
 I
 said,
 the


biggest
 risk
 that
 we
 face
 is
 that
 the


world
 changes
 too
 quickly.
 Not
 too


quickly,
 it's
 going
 to
 change
 quickly


and
 we
 don't
 change
 quickly
 enough
 to


adapt.
 And
 if
 behavior
 about
 of
 in
 the


consumption
 of
 these
 platforms
 is
 moving


to
 TV,
 then
 we
 need
 to
 move
 to
 TV
 too
 as


a
 form
 factor.
 And
 if
 we're
 late,
 that's


on
 us


>> right
 now.
 That's
 on
 me.


>> It's
 on
 you.
 Uh,
 right
 now
 these
 videos


with


>> your
 deep
 voice
 that
 sounded
 heavy.


>> It
 did.
 It
 came
 off
 a
 little
 more


dramatic
 than
 I
 intended.
 Um,
 when
 I'm


on
 Instagram
 looking
 at
 video,
 it's


almost
 all
 uh
 vertical
 video.
 When
 I


look
 at
 a
 TV,
 it's
 not.
 Um,
 have
 you


through
 this
 exploration,
 have
 you


thought
 about
 whether
 the
 stuff
 that's


on
 Instagram
 today
 works
 on
 TV
 or
 do
 you


need
 to
 go
 out
 and,
 you
 know,
 basically


source
 new
 video
 that
 that
 fits
 a
 TV


screen?


>> I
 think
 the
 vertical
 content
 can
 work
 on


TV
 because
 I
 think
 we
 can
 also
 show


there's
 a
 couple
 we
 can
 show
 social


context.
 We
 can
 show
 you
 the
 comments.


We
 can
 show
 who
 else
 is
 watching.


There's
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 we
 can
 do
 with


that
 space.
 We
 might,
 we
 do
 still
 have


horizontal
 content.
 We
 might
 need
 to


lean
 into
 that,
 too.
 But
 I'd
 rather


first
 figure
 out
 how
 we
 can
 embrace
 the


content
 ecosystem
 that
 already
 exists


and
 the
 creatives
 that
 already
 exists
 on


the
 platform.
 And
 if
 we
 have
 to
 expand


um
 if
 it
 turns
 out
 we
 have
 to
 expand,


then
 we'll
 certainly
 consider
 that.
 Then


>> I
 was
 going to
 say,
 is
 there
 a
 world
 in


which
 you
 go
 and
 you
 know
 uh
 license
 uh


more
 kickback
 content?
 I
 don't
 like


licensing
 content
 if
 I
 can
 avoid
 it.
 The


So
 we
 we
 mean
 look,
 we
 pay
 for
 lots
 of


licensing
 in
 general
 for
 people
 are


going
 to
 share
 stuff
 on
 our
 platform


whether
 or
 not
 we
 want
 them
 to,
 music


licenses,
 etc.
 We're
 always
 going
 to
 try


to
 make
 sure
 we
 pay
 people
 for
 the


rights,
 you
 know,
 when
 we
 need
 to.
 But
 I


wouldn't
 I'm
 not
 interested
 in
 trying
 to


go
 get
 sports
 rights
 or
 exclusive


entertainment
 rights
 because
 I'd
 much


rather
 be
 the
 second
 screen.
 I'd
 much


rather
 be
 where
 you
 talk
 about
 the
 the


game
 or
 the
 movie.
 Um,
 we're
 in
 I
 feel


like
 connecting
 with
 your
 friends
 and


short
 form
 video
 can
 be
 really
 symbiotic


and
 short
 form
 video
 and
 long
 form
 video


can
 be
 really
 symbiotic.
 But
 long
 form


video
 and
 connecting
 with
 your
 friends


is
 really
 difficult
 to
 do
 in
 one
 place.


If
 you're
 just
 watching
 a
 basketball


game
 or
 a
 movie
 or
 an
 hourlong
 show,


it's
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 that
 you're
 not


actually
 talking
 to
 a
 friend.
 A
 lot
 of


things
 you're
 not
 sending
 to
 friends
 or


seeing
 that
 you
 might
 send
 to
 friends,


etc.
 So
 I
 I'd
 rather
 focus
 on
 user


generated
 content
 creators
 AI
 and
 less


on
 premium
 long
 form
 licensed
 content.


>> We've
 hit
 all
 the
 zeros.
 Very
 last
 so


that
 I
 don't
 get
 in
 trouble.
 What's
 your


one
 tip
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 a
 creator


trying
 to
 um
 hit
 it
 big
 on
 Instagram


today?
 What's
 the
 one
 piece
 of
 advice


you
 would
 give?


>> And
 again
 short
 so
 that
 I
 don't
 get
 you


know


>> Yeah.
 You
 don't
 get
 too
 much
 trouble
 out


now.
 I
 can
 just
 fill
 a
 buster
 and
 go.


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 get
 me
 back.
 I
 think
 it's


really
 important
 to
 be
 intentional,


specifically
 to
 articulate
 what
 you're


trying
 to
 accomplish
 by
 using
 a
 platform


like
 Instagram.


So,
 you
 might
 be
 trying
 to
 sell
 a


product
 or
 brand
 or
 raise
 awareness
 for


a
 cause
 or,
 you
 know,
 build
 up
 demand


for
 a
 brand.
 What
 just
 write
 down
 what


you're
 trying
 to
 accomplish
 and
 then


also
 to
 be
 very
 clear
 about
 what
 is


going
 to
 actually
 resonate
 with
 an


audience,
 what's
 going
 to
 work
 on
 the


platform.
 And
 you
 need
 to
 find
 a
 content


strategy
 that
 is
 at
 the
 overlap
 of
 those


two
 things
 because
 reach
 is
 great
 but


reach
 is
 a
 means
 to
 an
 end.
 So
 if
 you


find
 content
 that
 is
 engaging
 but
 it's


not
 actually
 helping
 you
 move
 towards


your
 goals,
 it's
 useless.
 And
 if
 you


find
 content
 that
 is
 going
 to
 help
 you


with
 your
 goals
 but
 no
 one
 sees
 it,
 it's


not
 going
 to
 be
 effective.
 It
 is
 much


harder
 to
 find
 a
 content
 strategy
 that


does
 both.
 But
 that's
 the
 job.
 That's


the
 work.
 And
 that's
 going
 to
 require


persistence,
 intentionality,
 and


experimentation.
 But
 I
 really
 s
 I
 really


preach
 the
 overlap.
