It does seem like analysts were noting
that the pricing during the quarter was
weaker than expected and marks the
second straight quarter of softer
pricing.
And maybe that's why we're seeing the
stock down.
What do you want to say to investors?
Well, part of the reason our stocks are
down is this price to perfection.
If you look at what it's done year to
date and where the multiple has gone.
But, you know,
we had we had a really good quarter.
We had we had a double digit quarter.
We hadn't seen that for a couple of
years.
Double digit growth, sorry.
And pleased with the outcome.
One of the one of the challenges we had
this year was there's a lot of fluidity
around tariffs and what it means for
pricing.
And we will raise price.
To address costs in our customers supply
chain.
We we really don't want to raise more
than that because we believe it impairs
our ability to grow as fast as we'd
like.
And, you know, coming into the quarter,
we estimated, you know, x four for
impact of pricing came in a little bit
less.
We lowered our number for the fourth,
fourth quarter.
But the most important aspect is on a
price cost basis, we are neutral and
that's what we aspire to be.
We'd rather just grow.
Hmm.
And Dan, to your point, fast, and even
with the pullback today returning 22%
year to date, so outperforming the S&P
500 and comparable stocks in the
industrial space.
But just one more question on pricing.
In terms of expectations, Would you want
to raise pricing?
Like do you get the sense that consumers
and customers would push back just given
how you've been shifting into bigger
customers spending much more money?
Yeah, customers always push back on
pricing.
Doesn't matter the size of customer.
We will we we are having conversations
with our customer.
We will be doing some price increases in
Q4.
I suspect we'll be doing some price
increases as we move into 2026.
But again, our first discussion with the
customer,
they understand it.
They're willing to move on price.
Our first discussion is always what are
alternatives to this product?
That maybe doesn't mean we have to raise
your prices 5%.
Maybe it means it only has to be two,
and we'd rather go to two because that's
what that's what a supply chain partner
does.
Well, then how did tariffs fit into
this?
Just given that, according to analysts
across the street, when we look at
certain industries now is when we're
going to see tariffs showing up in the
third quarter in guidance as a as it
relates to 2026, what are you seeing and
how are you kind of attacking or
addressing any pressures from tariffs?
Yeah.
So for us, tariffs have been in the in
the equation since the early part of the
second quarter, a little bit of the
first quarter.
I think in the individual that handles
pricing historically, he'll provide us
an update once a month.
He'd gotten to the point where he was
providing us updates.
He he was up to a video number of 14 as
of July that he was serving out to the
field, giving them guidance into what we
were seeing in our supply chain.
And and so we've been adding price as
we've gone through the year and these
have been discussions with customers.
And I hope that answers your question.
No, I think it does.
But I think the big thing is are you
mitigating the impact of tariffs?
Are you shifting your supply chain?
Is the expectation that you can have
some kind of knock on effect as it
relates to pricing?
If we do continue to see threats from
the president going after countries like
China or others, We are going to talk to
one of the members of Levi's management
team, and they called out that they had
to dial up their expectations for the
impact of tariffs from other countries.
So how is that impacting when you look
at your supply chain and when you look
at the potential for pricing impacts In
2026, we've been moving supply chain
around the planet in earnest since 2017
2018 timeframe.
As our name would imply, we sell a lot
of factors and most of the factors in
North America come from either mainland
China or Taiwan.
And the automotive industry took the
production there back in the fifties and
sixties, actually took it to Japan and
South Korea and it migrated from there.
If I look at our resources, we now have
a sourcing team in Shanghai, but we have
a sourcing team in Bangkok, we have a
sourcing team in northern India and we
have worked to diversify our supplier
base around the planet and a little bit
more in North America, but really around
the planet.
So to have diversity in supply so you're
not caught off guard by some price
change or or a tariff change.
In addition to that, we have taken
supply chains coming in North America,
which traditionally came in through the
West Coast, the United States, and then
we would redistribute from there.
We have moved supply chains.
So they're bringing product directly
into the west coast of Canada or the
west coast of Mexico, because those two
countries represent about 14% of our
revenue.
Now, you bypass the tariff, however,
it's more expensive to break shipments
down over in Asia and bring them in, but
it's a lot less than a tariff.
