[Music]


Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.


We're
 live
 and
 you
 know
 I
 can
 actually


say
 good
 morning
 and
 I
 can
 put
 a
 little


bit
 of
 emphasis
 on
 the
 good
 part
 because


uh
 it
 might
 actually
 become
 a
 good


morning.
 It
 might
 actually
 become
 a
 good


morning
 if
 you
 were
 up
 a
 little
 bit


earlier
 like
 at
 around
 2:45
 a.m.
 Eastern


Standard.
 Uh
 it
 was
 not
 that
 good
 of
 a


morning
 and
 you
 were
 bracing
 yourself


for
 a
 very
 ugly
 morning.
 And
 it's
 still


not
 the
 the
 most
 green
 morning,
 but
 my


goodness,
 at
 2
 to
 3:00
 am
 Eastern,
 it


was
 bad,
 bro.
 It
 was
 bad.
 And
 if
 you


were
 awake,
 you
 understood.
 Honestly,
 if


you
 were
 awake
 even
 a
 couple
 hours
 ago


and
 saw
 your
 portfolio,
 you
 understood.


You
 got
 a
 peak
 of
 what
 happened.
 If


you're
 just
 waking
 up,
 just
 getting
 into


it,
 you
 just
 got
 your
 coffee,
 you
 didn't


even
 check
 your
 portfolio,
 then
 you


might
 not
 have
 even
 uh
 dealt
 with
 the


volatility
 of
 what
 happened
 over
 the


past
 couple
 hours.
 But
 at
 2:40
 a.m.,


3:00
 a.m.,
 don't
 ask
 me
 why
 I
 was awake.


I
 don't
 even
 know
 why
 I
 was
 awake.
 But


you
 just
 start
 getting
 notifications.


Notifications
 across
 the
 board.
 Tons
 and


tons
 and
 tons
 of
 notifications.
 And


these
 notifications
 are
 coming
 from
 your


brokerage.
 In
 this
 case,
 it
 was
 coming


from
 Robin.
 And
 Robin
 was
 saying,
 "This


is
 down
 5%.
 This
 is
 down
 5%.
 This
 is


down
 3%.
 This
 is
 down
 10%.
 This
 is
 down


4%."
 And
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 put
 out
 at
 2:46


a.m.
 If
 you
 are
 awake,
 don't
 look
 at


your
 portfolio.
 And
 I
 genuinely
 meant


it.
 Like
 I
 wasn't
 even
 joking.
 I
 was


like,
 "Dude,
 just
 don't
 just
 don't
 look


at
 it."
 Like
 like
 you
 will
 be
 happier
 if


you
 don't
 look
 at
 it.
 And
 I
 don't
 know


why
 it
 was
 happening.
 I
 mean,
 we're


talking
 about
 like
 Friday
 uh
 last
 week


3%
 draw
 down
 type
 of
 selloff
 at
 2
 a.m.


with
 zero
 reason
 other
 than
 maybe
 the


regional
 bank
 volatility
 that
 we'll
 talk


about
 more
 uh
 that
 happened
 yesterday.


maybe
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 October
 general


volatility,
 maybe
 options
 expiring,
 but


it
 was
 2
 a.m.
 like
 you
 couldn't
 even


give
 it
 a
 reason.
 Everything
 was
 just


dumping.


And
 10
 minutes
 ago,
 literally
 10
 minutes


ago,
 the
 S&P
 500,
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right


here,
 is
 now
 flat
 on
 the
 day.
 It's
 19


cents
 from
 going
 green.
 Why?
 Because


Trump
 had
 an
 interview.
 I
 don't
 even


know
 where
 he
 had
 this
 interview,
 but
 we


have
 the
 quotes
 of
 the
 interview.
 We


don't
 have
 the
 footage
 yet.
 And
 Trump


basically,
 I
 he
 might
 be
 on
 Air
 Force


One
 to
 be
 honest.
 and
 uh
 and
 you
 have


reporters
 basically
 posting
 what
 he


said.
 Um
 he
 he
 basically
 said,
 "Yeah,


don't
 worry
 about
 the
 tariffs
 on
 China.


I'm
 not
 actually
 going
 to
 do
 it."


[Laughter]


I
 didn't
 even
 take
 out
 my
 toothpaste
 in


the
 bathroom.
 I
 woke
 up
 and
 I
 was
 like,


"Man,
 today
 is
 just
 going
 to
 be
 a
 rough


day.
 You're
 down
 a
 lot
 of
 money."
 I
 go


to
 the
 bathroom.
 I
 have
 my
 phone
 with


me.
 I'm
 opening
 up
 the
 toothpaste
 and


then
 everything
 reverses
 and
 it's
 just


massive
 green
 candles
 across
 the
 board.


Yes,
 he
 said
 that
 this
 morning
 and
 as
 a


result
 that
 is
 what's
 created
 uh
 a
 lot


of
 this
 rally.
 So
 here
 are
 the
 quotes


from
 what
 he
 says.
 This
 is
 the
 these
 are


the
 quotes
 we
 have
 but
 uh
 I
 don't
 have


the
 footage
 on
 this
 yet.
 So
 Trump
 says


on
 China
 tariffs
 we
 have
 to
 find
 a
 fair


deal.
 We're
 going
 to
 do
 fine
 with
 China.


100%
 tariff
 is
 not
 sustainable.
 That
 was


the
 big
 one
 that
 really
 got
 the
 market


to
 be
 excited
 and
 said
 oh
 he's
 not
 going


to
 do
 this
 tariff
 thing.
 And
 then
 on


China
 tariffs
 it's
 not
 sustainable.
 On


China
 trade
 I
 don't
 know
 what's
 going
 to


happen.
 China's
 always
 looking
 for
 an


edge.
 We'll
 see
 what
 happens.
 and
 I'm


meeting
 with
 Xi
 in
 two
 weeks.
 These
 also


aren't
 the
 most
 bullish
 comments.
 I


mean,
 he's
 leaving
 a
 lot
 of
 uncertainty,


right?
 He's
 not
 saying
 like,
 yeah,
 for


sure,
 you
 know,
 China,
 everything
 is


going
 to
 be
 great.
 He
 he's
 like
 he's


like
 trying
 to
 sugarcoat
 it
 and
 say,


"We'll
 be
 fine.
 We'll
 figure
 something


out."
 Which
 is
 good
 to
 hear,
 but
 it's


not
 like
 definitively
 the
 most
 bullish


thing
 in
 the
 world,
 but
 it's
 enough
 to


get
 the
 market
 to
 be
 like,
 "Okay,
 good.


We
 don't
 have
 to
 worry
 that
 much


anymore."


I
 mean,
 dude,
 this
 is
 crazy,
 bro.
 This


is
 absolutely
 crazy.
 Like
 this
 is


absolutely
 freaking
 crazy.
 I
 I
 just
 I


like
 you
 I
 know
 I'm
 turning
 28
 in
 in
 10


days,
 but
 I
 feel
 like
 I've
 aged
 10
 years


in
 the
 past
 like
 10
 hours.
 Like
 this
 is


like
 this
 is
 just
 wild,
 bro.
 Like
 when
 I


mean
 at
 2:40
 a.m.
 everything
 collapsed.


It
 was
 bad.
 And
 if
 you
 were
 sleeping


then
 thankfully
 you
 didn't
 have
 to see


it.
 But
 if
 you're
 international
 then
 you


know
 it
 probably
 wasn't
 2
 a.m.
 for
 you.


It
 was
 probably
 morning
 and
 so
 you
 did


see
 it.
 S&P
 500
 right
 there
 going
 green.


And
 the
 weird
 thing
 is
 no
 one
 had
 a


reason,
 right?
 So
 it
 was
 just
 like
 are


we
 going
 to
 have
 a
 Black
 Friday
 or


something?
 Like
 why
 is
 this
 happening?


And
 I
 guess
 the
 reason
 was
 China.
 I
 I


guess
 the
 market
 was
 so
 upset
 about


China
 that
 they
 needed
 Trump
 to
 just
 say


something
 positive
 about
 China
 in
 the


morning
 to
 fix
 everything.


But
 I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 This
 is
 quite


incredible.
 This
 is
 quite
 freaking
 It


was
 one
 of
 those
 dips
 in
 the
 pre-market


where
 you
 you
 didn't
 even
 want
 to
 buy


the
 dip.
 You
 were
 just
 like,
 I
 can't


touch
 this
 until
 I
 know
 what's


happening.
 Like
 why
 are
 we
 down?
 And
 you


had
 no
 reason.
 Tesla
 right
 there
 about


to
 break
 even.
 Palter
 still
 down
 half%.


Robin
 had
 got
 to
 124,
 folks.
 And
 by
 the


way,
 let
 me
 just
 say
 this
 right
 here.
 I


don't
 think
 we're
 out
 of
 the
 woods.
 I


do.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 genuinely
 don't
 know


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 at
 9:30.
 I
 mean,


this
 thing
 could
 be
 a
 head
 fake.
 It


could
 reverse.
 We
 could
 go
 right
 back
 to


like
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 what
 could
 happen


going
 into
 the
 market
 open,
 but
 at
 least


we're
 not
 going
 into
 the
 market
 open


with
 the
 type
 of
 [ __ ]
 we
 had
 five
 hours


ago
 because
 that
 was
 just
 ugly.
 I
 mean,


again,
 Hood
 was,
 you
 know,
 trying
 to


potentially
 break
 the
 120s.
 Meta
 was
 at


690.
 I
 mean,
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 stuff


reversing.
 Ethereum
 got
 to
 3500,
 now


it's
 at
 37.
 Bitcoin
 still
 ugly
 though.


Bitcoin
 got
 to
 103.
 I
 mean,
 it
 bounced


from
 103
 at
 105.
 Cool.
 It's
 at
 105.
 But


this
 thing
 was
 at
 126
 two
 weeks
 ago.
 So,


Bitcoin
 has
 completely
 lost
 a
 lot
 of
 its


momentum.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 whenever
 Trump


made
 these
 comments
 about
 China,
 the


price
 of
 gold,
 as
 you
 can
 see
 on
 that


red
 candle
 right
 there,
 took
 a
 hit.


We're
 still
 above
 4,300.
 We
 were
 pushing


4,400
 before
 Trump
 made
 these
 China


comments.
 We
 were
 at
 4380,
 as
 you
 can


see
 right
 there.
 And
 then
 Trump
 made


these
 comments
 and
 that
 helped
 it
 kind


of
 go
 down.
 Yeah,
 at least
 our
 covered


calls
 are
 printing.


But
 outside
 of
 that,
 it
 was
 ugly,
 dude.


Mass
 Alos,
 maybe
 it
 was
 mass
 alos.
 I


have
 I
 have
 no
 idea,
 dude.
 Honestly,


last
 night
 I
 just
 couldn't
 sleep.
 Like,


it
 it
 wasn't
 even
 like
 I
 was
 up
 checking


my
 portf
 I
 just
 genuinely
 you
 know
 what


I
 think
 happened
 yesterday?
 I
 played


basketball
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 a


couple
 years
 uh
 when
 I
 went
 downstairs


to
 the
 gym
 and
 instead
 of
 doing
 my


regular
 workout,
 I
 saw
 people
 playing


basketball
 in
 in
 the
 apartment
 building.


And
 I've
 been
 here
 for
 a
 month
 and
 I've


never
 seen
 people
 playing
 basketball.
 So


I
 immediately
 went
 to
 the
 basketball


court
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Yeah,
 you
 guys


play
 basketball?"
 "Yeah,
 every
 Thursday


at
 8:00
 p.m."
 I
 was
 like, "Oh,
 perfect."


So,
 so
 I
 played
 basketball.
 We
 won
 the


first
 game.
 We
 got
 our
 asses
 handed
 to


us
 on
 the
 second
 game.
 We
 couldn't
 score


a
 single
 point.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 I
 had
 a


ton
 of
 energy
 after
 playing
 basketball


for
 literally
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 four


years.
 And
 I
 just
 couldn't
 fall
 asleep.


And
 then
 while
 I
 can't
 fall
 asleep,
 I'm


getting
 these
 notifications.
 And
 it's


it's
 disgusting.
 Fear
 and
 greed.
 By
 the


way,
 we
 are
 in
 extreme
 fear.
 660
 on
 the


S&P.
 673
 was
 the
 all-time
 high
 and


somehow
 660
 is
 extreme
 fear.
 To
 to
 give


a
 little
 context,
 we
 were
 in
 extreme


fear
 back
 in
 April
 when
 the
 S&P
 500
 was


at
 5,000
 and
 we
 were
 20%
 away
 from


alltime
 highs.
 We
 are
 less
 than
 3%
 away


from
 alltime
 highs
 and
 we
 are
 somehow
 in


extreme
 fear
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy
 but


um
 yeah
 it's
 been
 it's
 been
 a
 wild


morning.
 It
 has
 been
 an
 absolutely
 wild


morning
 to
 be
 fair
 extreme
 and
 being


barely
 down
 his
 bullish
 note.
 Yes.
 I


mean,
 look,
 if
 the
 look,
 the
 fear
 and


greed
 index
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


nonacademic
 ways
 to
 judge
 if
 you
 should


buy
 the
 dip
 or
 not
 buy
 the
 it's
 just


like
 literally
 a
 fear
 and
 greed
 index,


but
 it
 has
 worked.
 Like,
 if
 you
 overlay


it
 on
 the
 S&P
 500,
 it
 legit
 is
 accurate


with
 when
 you
 buy
 the
 S&P
 versus
 when


you
 should
 sell
 the
 S&P.
 So,
 it's
 worked


historically.
 Uh,
 and
 the
 fact
 that


we're
 only
 3%
 away
 from
 alltime
 highs


and
 we're
 at
 extreme
 fear,
 I
 think,
 is


super
 bullish,
 it's
 quite
 phenomenal
 to


even
 believe
 that
 that's
 happening.
 But,


it
 goes
 to
 show
 the
 resilience
 of
 the


market.
 It
 goes
 to
 show
 the
 market's


belief
 in
 rate
 cuts.
 goes
 to
 show
 the


market's
 belief
 in
 in
 earn
 earnings


potential,
 which
 we've
 already
 seen,
 you


know,
 good
 earnings
 across
 the
 board
 and


uh
 now
 it's
 just
 a
 question
 of,
 you


know,
 if
 this
 market
 ends
 up
 continuing


to
 get
 back
 to
 those
 all-time
 highs.


It's
 a
 simple
 but
 effective
 metric.
 That


is
 correct.


That
 is
 correct.


You
 were
 just
 talking
 about
 your
 you


were
 just
 talking
 about
 being
 afraid
 to


look
 at
 your
 portfolio
 last
 night.
 That


is
 extreme
 fear.
 Yeah,
 that's
 fair.


Well,
 the
 thing
 is
 we've
 had
 such
 a
 good


two-month
 run
 with
 August
 and
 September.


And
 so,
 you
 know,
 my
 cousin
 was
 texting


me
 last
 night
 and
 she
 was
 like, "Dude,


I'm
 down
 the
 most
 I've
 been
 down
 ever."


And
 I
 was
 like,
 "The
 one
 thing
 I
 can


tell
 you
 is
 like,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 all


the
 gains
 you've
 seen
 in
 the
 past
 couple


months,
 and
 this
 is
 to
 myself
 as
 well


and
 to
 everybody
 here,
 might
 not
 have


been
 as
 real."
 And
 I
 think
 we
 all
 kind


of
 knew
 it
 to
 an
 extent,
 right?
 It's
 not


normal
 to
 have
 the
 types
 of
 August
 and


September,
 particularly
 August
 and


September.
 Like,
 forget
 a
 two-month


rally.
 An
 August
 and
 September
 two-month


rally
 is
 not
 normal
 because
 those
 months


historically
 are
 weak.
 for
 us
 to
 ignore


all
 of
 that
 and
 just
 push
 through
 and


keep
 making
 all-time
 highs.
 Again,
 it's


not
 easy.
 And
 so,
 one
 could
 argue
 that


maybe
 those
 gains
 weren't
 even
 justified


in
 the
 first
 place
 to
 be
 able
 to
 keep


them.
 But
 now
 that
 we
 got
 them,
 no
 one


wants
 to
 lose
 them.
 And
 so,
 it
 does


become
 extreme
 fear
 in
 what
 is


historically
 the
 most
 volatile
 month
 of


the
 year,
 which
 is
 October,
 when
 when


you
 do
 lose
 them.
 And,
 you
 know,
 now


it's
 just
 a
 question
 of,
 hey,
 do
 we
 have


to
 lose
 them
 or
 can
 we
 keep
 them
 up?


So,
 we
 got
 to
 see
 we
 got
 to
 see
 how
 this


ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 But
 nonetheless,
 it


has
 been
 a
 pretty
 pretty
 wild
 morning.


No,
 I
 slept
 at
 like
 I
 think
 I
 slept
 at


like
 3:30
 or
 something.


So,
 I
 ended
 up
 sleeping
 like
 40
 minutes


after
 the
 looking
 at
 the
 portfolio.
 But


still,
 it
 was
 ugly.
 It
 was
 ugly.
 All


right,
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 right
 here.


Let's
 talk
 about
 some
 of
 the
 other


headlines.
 Hope
 everyone
 is
 still
 doing


okay.
 Again,
 9:30.
 I
 don't
 know
 what's


going
 to
 happen.
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 going


to
 be


How
 much
 did
 you
 put
 up?
 I
 scored
 two


points
 in
 the
 first
 game.
 I
 scored
 zero


in
 the
 second
 game.
 I
 had
 a
 nice


three-pointer
 in
 the
 first
 game
 though,


but
 the
 three-pointer
 counts
 as
 two


points.


But
 then,
 dude,
 the
 second
 game
 we
 just


got
 shamacked,
 like
 destroyed.
 And
 then


I
 came
 back
 and
 I
 did
 the
 live
 stream


with
 Steve
 and
 I
 stayed
 up
 with
 Steve


basically
 till
 like
 12:00
 a.m.
 And
 then


I
 just
 couldn't
 fall
 asleep.


And
 then
 we
 see
 the
 portfolios
 go
 down.


No
 way
 amid
 is
 good,
 bro.
 They
 used
 to


call
 me
 Ricky
 Rubio.
 They
 used
 to
 call


me
 Ricky
 Rubio
 on
 the
 streets,
 bro.
 I'm


I'm
 like
 I'm
 not
 good
 at
 basketball


anymore,
 but
 when
 I
 was
 in
 my
 prime,


when
 I
 was
 in
 high
 school
 and
 I
 was
 like


playing
 at
 my
 local
 park,
 like
 I
 used
 to


put
 up
 30


30.
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 even
 saying


that
 like
 to
 I
 legit
 used
 to
 put
 up
 30,


bro.


The
 Euroep
 is
 my
 favorite.
 I
 learned
 it


from
 Genobi.
 But
 all right.
 Anyway,
 so


that's
 what
 we
 got
 in
 the
 context
 of


Trump
 and
 China.
 Let's
 get
 into
 some
 of


the
 stuff
 that
 happened
 yesterday
 with


uh
 with
 these
 regional
 banks.
 So


yesterday,
 another
 reason
 we
 had
 Oh,


actually
 before
 we
 do
 reg
 actually
 no,


let's
 do
 regional
 bank.
 Uh
 the
 reason


the
 regional
 bank
 stuff
 was
 such
 a
 big


issue
 is
 because
 two
 companies
 reported


Key
 Bank
 and
 Zion's
 Bank.
 And
 basically


they
 both
 said
 we
 have
 some
 bad
 credit.


We
 have
 some
 bad
 credit.
 And
 as
 a
 result


of
 having
 some
 bad
 credit,
 uh
 this
 is


the
 reason
 the
 S&P
 500
 went
 red


yesterday,
 intraday
 at
 1
 p.m.
 because


basically
 Zion's
 and
 uh
 and
 Western
 uh


Alliance
 said,
 you
 know,
 we
 might
 not


know
 if
 the
 credit
 quality
 that
 we
 have


been
 putting
 out
 is
 the
 best.
 Now,
 they


kind
 of
 hedged
 their
 bets
 by
 saying,


look,
 some
 of
 the
 credit
 issues
 we're


having
 are
 one-off
 events
 and
 they're


based
 on
 like
 these
 legal
 uh
 uh
 fraud


cases
 that
 we're
 dealing
 with.
 So,
 it's


not
 necessarily
 the
 worst
 thing
 in
 the


world,
 but
 the
 market
 didn't
 care.
 The


market
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 a
 credit
 problem.


Bet.
 We're
 selling
 everything."


A
 credit
 problem.
 We
 are
 selling


everything.
 And
 so,
 I
 mean,
 I
 guess


another
 reason
 at
 2
 am
 the
 markets
 got


scared
 is
 because
 maybe
 there
 were
 some


fears
 of
 this
 credit
 stuff
 and
 that


created
 also
 some
 pain.
 Um,
 I,
 you
 know,


Chris
 was
 on
 yesterday
 for
 Macro


Thursday.
 We
 talked
 about
 the
 credit


issues
 and
 he
 was
 like,
 "Dude,
 this


feels
 very
 isolated
 because
 JP
 Morgan,


Goldman
 Sachs,
 Bank
 of
 America,
 Morgan,


all
 these
 guys
 were
 like,
 "Credit
 is


fine."
 In
 fact,
 they
 said
 credit


delinquency
 rates
 are
 coming
 in
 lower


than
 expected.
 So,
 the
 idea
 that
 the


balance
 sheets
 are
 horrible
 for
 these


banks,
 the
 idea
 that
 their
 underwriting


is
 horrible.
 I
 mean,
 it
 really
 does
 feel


isolated
 to
 a
 couple
 banks.
 Reminds
 me


of
 Silicon
 Valley
 bank
 collapse
 in
 2023.


People
 thought
 there
 was
 a
 bank


contagion
 that
 would
 spread
 to
 like
 the


JP
 Morgans
 of
 the
 world.
 JP
 Morgan
 and


Goldman
 Sachs,
 Bank
 of America,
 they


become
 too
 big
 literally
 to
 fail.
 Could


they
 fail?
 Yes.
 But
 I
 mean
 they
 become


too
 big
 to
 fail.
 So
 the
 regional
 banks


could
 fail
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 anyone


would
 really
 notice
 those
 big
 banks


would
 consume
 them
 and
 things
 would
 go


on.
 This
 is
 exactly
 what
 happened
 in


March
 of
 2023.
 Um
 so
 it
 was
 kind
 of


weird
 that
 the
 market
 got
 so
 upset


yesterday.
 But
 it
 also
 made
 sense


because
 any
 level
 of
 credit
 problems
 in


the
 country,
 you
 know,
 that
 that
 could


cause
 a
 bank
 run,
 that
 could
 cause
 a


bunch
 of
 different
 things.
 But
 I
 don't


think
 that
 was
 the
 reason
 we
 sold
 off
 at


2
 am.
 It
 might
 have
 contributed
 to
 some


of
 the
 perception.
 It's
 just
 it's
 hard


to
 imagine
 that
 that's
 a
 structural


reason
 that
 could
 create
 as
 much
 pain
 as


it
 did,
 but
 that
 was
 one
 of
 the
 issues


that
 we
 had.
 Yeah,
 TFC
 had
 their


earnings
 this
 morning.
 So,
 3Q
 provision


for
 credit
 losses
 436
 versus
 484.
 That's


way
 better
 than
 expected.
 Fifth
 third


credit
 uh
 for
 provision
 losses
 197


versus
 239.
 Again,
 way
 better
 than


expected.
 And
 then
 uh
 RF
 105
 versus
 129.


So
 you
 had
 a
 bunch
 of
 regional
 banks


this
 morning
 report
 their
 earnings
 and


their
 provision
 for
 credit
 losses
 was


way
 better
 than
 expected
 which
 is
 also


another
 reason
 to
 not
 be
 that
 afraid
 of


the
 regional
 banks.
 You
 can
 see
 right


there
 TFC
 is
 up
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 all


and
 again
 regional
 banks
 are
 banks
 that


are
 in
 a
 certain
 region
 of
 the
 country


and
 they're
 not
 like
 the
 city
 banks
 or


the
 Wells
 Fargo
 of
 the
 world
 but
 they


serve
 a
 demographic
 that
 is
 specific
 to


their
 location.
 And
 the
 reason
 for
 that


is
 because
 if
 you're
 a
 local
 laundromat


in
 Georgia
 you
 know
 you're
 not
 going
 to


go
 to
 JP
 Morgan
 to
 get
 a
 loan.
 you're


going to
 go
 to
 your
 local
 bank
 and
 that


and
 these
 local
 banks
 the
 truis
 is


actually
 like
 you
 know
 it's
 the
 seventh


largest
 bank
 in
 the
 country
 but
 uh
 it
 is


a
 regional
 bank
 so
 if
 the
 big
 banks
 are


not
 showing
 these
 credit
 issues
 why
 are


the
 little
 banks
 having
 massive
 credit


issues
 well
 maybe
 they're
 not
 maybe
 it's


isolated
 to
 a
 couple
 instances


and
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 the
 regional


banking
 piece
 is
 if
 that's
 the
 thing


that
 tanks
 us
 in
 2025
 regional
 banks
 if


that's
 really
 the
 thing
 that
 like
 that


that
 a
 would
 be
 a
 surprise
 b
 it
 just


feels
 not
 that
 believable
 because
 the


big
 banks
 would
 show
 some
 cracks
 before


the
 regional
 banks


show
 these
 massive
 dire
 structural


warnings
 that
 everyone
 has
 to
 run
 for


the
 hills
 for


and
 as
 a
 result
 hopefully
 it's
 not
 that


that
 big
 of
 a
 deal.
 Um
 also
 SoFi
 a
 lot


of
 questions
 came
 yesterday
 on
 like
 is


SoFi
 going to
 be
 affected.
 So
 fell
 to


2550
 in
 the
 pre-market
 SoFi
 right
 there


2631.
 I
 think
 the
 answer
 is
 no
 because


SoFi's
 credit
 underwriting
 is
 phenomenal


and
 so
 I
 really
 wouldn't
 be
 worried


about
 SoFi.
 Tanner
 did
 a
 video
 yesterday


on
 SoFi
 and
 he
 said
 that
 he
 has
 some


data
 he's
 looking
 at
 that
 says
 SoFi
 is


going
 to
 have
 their
 first
 million
 member


quarter
 this
 quarter
 in
 Q3
 which
 would


be
 quite
 incredible.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 SoFi


is
 really
 restrictive
 with
 loans.
 Like


they're
 not
 going to
 give
 you
 a
 loan


just
 because
 they
 want
 to
 increase
 their


their
 loan
 sheet.
 So
 I
 I
 do
 think
 that


SoFi
 is
 going
 to
 be
 okay.
 I
 don't
 think


this
 regional
 stuff
 is
 as
 endemic
 as


some
 people
 may
 think.
 We
 got
 an
 update


right
 here
 on
 Bent
 and
 what
 he's
 going


to
 be
 doing
 with
 China
 today.
 So,
 let's


get
 that
 update,
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going


from
 there.


>> Joe,
 I
 can
 report
 to
 you
 exclusively


today
 that
 uh
 Treasury
 Secretary
 Scott


Bessant
 and
 Chinese
 Vice
 Premier
 Ho


Leang
 are
 going
 to
 speak
 by
 phone
 to


discuss
 the
 ongoing
 trade
 negotiations


between
 the
 United
 States
 and
 China.
 I


don't
 have
 any
 other
 details
 here
 on
 the


timing
 of
 this
 phone
 call
 today
 that,


you
 know,
 the
 content
 of
 it
 or
 or
 what


the
 next
 steps
 will
 be.
 Um
 but
 the
 fact


that
 they
 are
 going
 to
 have
 this
 phone


conversation
 is
 notable
 because
 earlier


in
 the
 week
 the
 Treasury
 Secretary
 uh


declined
 to
 say
 specifically
 at
 his


press
 conference
 that
 he
 would
 be


speaking
 to
 his
 Chinese
 counterpart.
 He


said
 that
 the
 Chinese
 are
 in
 town
 for


the
 IMF
 gatherings
 that
 uh
 there
 are


certain
 dialogues
 going
 back
 and
 forth


but
 he
 didn't
 say
 specifically
 that
 he


and
 Huli
 Fang
 would
 be
 speaking.
 Now
 we


can
 report
 to
 you
 uh
 that
 they
 will
 be


speaking
 on
 the
 phone
 today.
 Uh
 and
 the


question
 is,
 you
 know,
 whether
 that


represents
 uh
 some
 kind
 of
 a


breakthrough
 in
 these
 this
 flare
 up
 of


tensions
 that
 we've
 seen
 over
 the
 past


week
 or
 at least
 uh
 maybe
 a
 platform


where
 uh
 some
 kind
 of
 a
 breakthrough


could
 happen,
 guys.
 So
 that's
 that's


what
 we've
 got.


>> Amen.
 It's
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 market.


>> Okay.
 I
 mean
 not
 bad.
 So
 uh
 this
 is
 also


probably
 coming
 down
 the
 markets.
 the


scent
 and
 uh
 the
 Chinese
 vice
 premere


will
 be
 talking
 today
 based
 on
 those


comments.
 And
 again,
 China,
 I
 forgot
 to


mention
 this,
 China
 yesterday
 after
 the


market
 open,
 they
 put
 out
 a
 statement


with
 their
 foreign
 ministry.
 Uh
 and
 they


said
 that
 decoupling
 from
 the
 United


States
 would
 be
 uh
 irrational
 or
 not


realistic.
 So,
 it's
 not
 like
 China
 is


trying
 to
 just
 like
 separate
 from
 the


US.
 They
 know
 that
 their
 economy
 cannot


survive
 without
 us.
 And
 so,
 this
 why
 it


just
 this
 feels
 so
 stupid.
 It's
 like
 if


the
 market's
 going
 down
 from
 China
 and


the
 US
 when
 we
 know
 that
 China
 and
 the


US
 is
 inevitable,
 that
 relationship
 will


have
 to
 work
 out
 at
 some
 point,
 then


this
 is
 all
 a
 buy
 the
 dip
 opportunity.


Unless
 there's
 another
 reason
 that's


more
 structural
 for
 why
 the
 market's


taking
 a
 hit.
 And
 quite
 frankly,
 I
 think


it's
 valuations
 have
 just
 run
 up
 a
 lot.


These
 rare
 earth
 stocks
 are
 up
 5%
 a
 day.


These
 Bitcoin
 minor
 stocks
 are
 up
 10%
 a


day.
 These
 uh
 nuclear
 stocks
 are
 up
 30%


a
 week.
 And
 so
 maybe
 the
 market
 is
 just


looking
 for
 some
 type
 of
 reason
 to
 bring


a
 little
 bit
 more
 calmness
 to
 all
 the


things
 that
 are
 running
 and
 they're


using
 China
 as
 an
 excuse,
 but
 it
 should


end
 up
 being
 a
 buy
 the
 dip.
 Now,
 does


that
 buy
 the
 dip
 result
 in
 all
 those


high-flying
 high
 beta
 names
 getting
 back


to
 their
 all-time
 highs
 when
 things


recover?
 I
 don't
 know.
 Honestly,
 it


probably
 does.
 If
 everything
 rallies,


then
 those
 probably
 come
 back.
 Or
 does


the
 market
 say,
 "All
 right,
 Nvidia
 gets


to
 go
 back
 to
 195,
 but
 Bit
 Farms
 doesn't


get
 to
 go
 back
 to
 seven
 bucks."


We're
 going
 to
 see.


We're
 going
 to
 see.
 But
 overall,
 it
 does


feel
 like
 markets
 are
 just
 exhausted
 and


they're
 using
 anything
 to
 to
 give
 them
 a


uh
 to
 give
 them
 an
 excuse.
 Yeah,
 gold
 is


down
 for
 the
 first
 time
 today
 in
 a
 long


time.
 And
 that's
 based
 on
 that
 China


headline
 that
 came
 out
 as
 well.
 Uh,


world
 trade
 officer
 cheap
 have
 spoken


with
 China,
 US
 to
 urge
 the
 escalation
 of


trade
 tensions.
 Both
 sides
 understand


the
 importance
 of
 dialogue.
 See,
 that's


more
 deescalation,
 which
 is
 also
 really


important.
 Also,
 Hasset
 was
 on
 this


morning,
 Kevin
 Hasset,
 the
 national


economic
 adviser,
 and
 he
 basically
 said


that
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 deal
 with


China
 in
 some
 way.
 The
 summary
 of
 what


he
 said
 is
 we'll
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 deal


with
 China.


So,
 I
 really
 don't
 think
 this
 is going


to
 be
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal,
 but
 we're


going
 to
 have
 to
 see.


China
 says
 China's
 upset
 because
 Bent


might
 punch
 them
 in
 the
 face.


Yeah,
 maybe
 that's
 why
 maybe
 that's
 why


they're
 finally
 negotiating.
 They
 don't


want
 to
 get
 punched.
 But
 dude,
 I
 still


refuse
 to
 believe
 Basent
 is
 out
 here


punching
 people,
 bro.
 Like,
 Bent
 is
 a


teddy
 bear,
 bro.
 You're
 telling
 me
 that


guy's
 punching
 people?


You're
 telling
 me
 this
 guy
 is
 out
 here


punching
 Elon
 Musk,
 bro?
 What
 are
 we


talking
 about?


What
 are
 we
 talking
 about?
 That'd
 be


hilarious.


Who
 knows?
 Maybe
 he
 is.
 Maybe
 he
 is.
 The


10
 years
 below
 four,
 that
 is
 also
 very


bullish.
 Chris
 and
 I
 were
 talking
 about


the
 yesterday.
 I
 mean,
 you
 can
 interpret


this
 as
 bearish,
 but
 uh
 I
 think
 it
 is


really
 good
 for
 the
 tenure
 to
 come
 down.


Obviously,
 that
 decreases
 the
 cost
 for


for
 the
 national
 debt,
 our
 borrowing


cost.
 This
 is
 something
 that
 Trump
 has


been
 trying
 to
 do
 since
 January,
 get


this
 tenure
 to
 come
 down.
 And
 the
 fact


that
 the
 market's
 not
 crashing
 like,
 you


know,
 we're
 talking
 about
 10
 15%
 decline


in
 the
 10
 years
 coming
 down
 is
 good.


That
 means
 people
 are
 running
 to
 bonds


as
 a
 form
 of
 safety,
 right?
 Because
 when


you
 buy
 bonds,
 that's
 when
 the
 yields


come
 down.
 Uh
 but
 gold
 going
 up
 and


bonds
 going
 and
 bond
 yields
 coming
 down


is
 weird
 because
 it
 means
 people
 are


buying
 gold
 which
 signals
 they're
 afraid


of
 inflation,
 right?
 You
 usually
 buy


gold
 as
 a
 hedge
 to
 inflation,
 a
 hedge
 to


geopolitical
 instability,
 a
 hedge
 to


market
 volatility.


Um,
 but
 you
 buy
 treasuries
 or
 you
 at le,


you
 know,
 one
 could
 say
 you
 buy
 the


10-year
 as
 a
 way
 to
 lock
 in
 a
 good
 rate


because
 you
 think
 that
 rates
 are
 going


to
 come
 down,
 aka
 inflation
 potentially


comes
 down
 and
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 command


more
 from
 the
 treasury
 for
 the
 cost
 of


capital
 because
 you
 have
 a
 faith
 at


least
 to
 some
 extent
 that
 inflation
 will


start
 to
 dissipate
 which
 is
 the
 whole


reason
 why
 rates
 will
 come
 down
 in
 the


first
 place.
 So,
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


weird
 dynamic.
 You
 usually
 don't
 see


both
 of
 those
 things
 happening,
 gold


going
 up
 and
 bond
 yields
 coming
 down,


but
 that
 is
 happening.
 Maybe
 that


changes
 if
 gold
 ends
 up,
 you
 know,


taking
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 breather.
 But
 I
 mean,


for
 gold
 to
 fall
 back
 down
 to
 35,
 3,600


would
 be
 a
 dramatic
 decline.
 Year
 to


date,
 gold
 is
 up
 61%.
 So
 it
 would
 be


hard
 to
 see
 it
 come
 down
 that
 much.
 So


that
 is
 another
 weird
 dynamic
 that's


kind
 of
 going
 on
 in
 the
 broader
 market


as
 well.


And
 I
 guess
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see


how
 that
 plays
 out.
 The
 VIX
 did
 close


above
 25
 yesterday.
 Usually
 the
 VIX


doesn't
 close
 above
 25.
 I
 mean,
 it's


happened
 four
 times
 over
 the
 past
 couple


years.
 So,
 you
 know,
 one
 could
 argue


that
 people
 are
 shorting
 the
 VIX
 as
 well


today,
 and
 that
 could
 be
 hurting
 some
 of


the
 volatility,


but
 nonetheless,
 that's
 what
 we
 got


going
 on.
 Oh,
 look
 at
 the
 text
 I
 just


got
 from
 our
 buddy.
 Look
 at
 the
 text
 I


just
 got
 from
 our
 buddy.
 He
 gave
 me
 a


screenshot


of
 uh
 he's
 watching.
 He's
 eating


breakfast
 and
 watching
 with
 us.
 He's


eating
 breakfast
 and
 watching
 with
 us.


Shout
 out
 to
 Mr.
 Steve.
 I
 don't
 even


know
 what
 time
 Steve
 slept.
 I
 left
 his


stream
 at
 12.
 I
 think
 he
 left
 at
 like


12:40
 or
 something,


but
 he's
 uh
 he's
 with
 us


drinking
 some
 Starbucks
 and
 watching
 the


show.
 All
 right,
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 had


with
 Bent,
 Trump,
 China.
 I
 mean,
 those


were
 the
 main
 headlines.
 We
 talked
 a
 bit


more
 about
 the
 regional
 banks.
 We
 talked


about
 gold.
 We'll
 see
 what
 happens.


Here's
 uh
 something
 that
 people
 might


not
 have
 seen.
 And
 uh
 this
 was
 pretty


cool
 to
 see
 last
 night.
 Ladies
 and


gentlemen,


got
 Mr.
 Karp
 and
 47.
 So
 there
 you
 go.


There
 is
 Karp
 and
 Trump
 together.
 If
 you


look
 closely,


you
 know
 that
 Karp
 likes
 his
 his
 Diet


Coke.
 Look
 at
 that.
 And
 Trump
 is
 also
 a


fan
 of
 Diet
 Coke.
 They
 got
 the
 the
 Coke


right
 there.


And
 uh
 there's
 there's
 Karp
 drinking
 the


Coke.


And
 then
 there's
 another
 picture.
 It's


pretty
 cool,
 dude.
 It's
 pretty
 cool.
 I


mean,
 obviously,
 we
 know
 that
 Palanter


has
 a
 important
 relationship
 with
 the


United
 States
 government.
 They've
 been


obviously
 growing
 their
 government


business
 rapidly,
 and
 whoever
 is
 in


office,
 I
 mean,
 as
 a
 shareholder,
 I
 want


the
 company
 to
 work
 with
 whoever
 is
 in


office.
 And
 Palanter
 has
 been
 working


with
 the
 government
 since
 Obama
 was


president.
 So,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


Democrat
 or
 Republican,
 you
 need
 to
 have


a
 good
 relationship
 with
 the


administration.


And
 it
 looks
 like
 Palanter
 is
 continuing


to
 expand
 that
 relationship.
 So,
 that
 is


one
 thing
 we
 have.
 Pounder
 earnings
 is


November
 3rd.
 We're
 going
 to
 see
 what


happens
 with
 Pounder
 on
 that
 earnings.
 I


mean,
 dude,
 I
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 put


up
 a
 pretty
 damn
 good
 quarter.
 And
 if


this
 macro
 China
 stuff
 is
 not
 that
 big


of
 a
 deal
 going
 into
 November,
 look,
 I


don't
 want
 to
 say
 pounder
 is
 going
 to


200,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 there
 is
 a
 world
 in


which
 Palanteer
 breaks
 through
 that


alltime
 high
 at
 190.
 Now,
 do
 they
 need


to
 is
 it
 justified
 from
 value?
 No.


Right?
 Like
 they
 don't
 need
 to
 do


anything.
 I
 mean
 that
 like
 the
 stock
 is


already
 pricing
 at
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff.
 But


if
 they
 put
 up
 one
 of
 those
 types
 of


quarters
 that's,
 you
 know,
 one
 of
 the


best
 quarters
 we're
 seeing
 in
 software


in
 the
 entire
 market,
 I
 think
 it
 has
 a


chance
 to
 do
 well.
 I
 think
 it
 has
 a


chance
 to
 do
 well.
 And
 I
 was
 talking


about
 with
 this
 with
 Steve
 yesterday.
 I


mean,
 we
 were
 looking
 at
 Salesforce


numbers.
 I
 kind
 of
 came
 to
 the


conclusion
 and
 Salesforce
 increased


their
 guidance
 and
 they,
 you
 know,
 they


said
 they'll
 get
 to
 a
 rule
 of
 50,
 etc.
 I


think
 Paler
 is
 the
 only
 exciting
 story


in
 software
 right
 now.
 Like
 what
 other


story
 in
 software
 is
 as
 exciting
 as
 Pal?


It's
 not
 Salesforce.
 It's
 not
 snowflake.


It's
 not
 data
 dog.
 It's
 not
 GitLab.


Like
 it's
 Paler.
 It's
 not
 Crowd
 Strike.


Like
 none
 of
 these
 stocks
 are
 grow.
 None


of
 these
 companies
 are
 growing
 at
 the


rate
 pounder
 is
 growing
 at.
 None
 of
 them


are
 getting
 the
 use
 cases
 that
 Paler
 is


getting
 through
 AI.
 And
 then
 none
 of


them
 are
 actually
 showing
 the
 potential


to
 expand
 to
 potentially
 become
 a


trillion
 dollar
 company
 at
 the
 scale


that
 Palter
 is
 doing
 it
 at.


It's
 just
 hard
 to
 find
 stories
 that
 are


that
 exciting
 as
 as
 Palanteer.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 Pounder
 gets
 a
 premium.
 But,
 you


know,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 how


that
 premium
 ultimately.
 Rubric's
 a


great
 company,
 but
 it's
 not
 as
 exciting


as
 pound.
 You
 know,
 when
 people
 think


like,
 hey,
 can
 you
 grow
 50%
 compounded


or
 at least
 40%
 compounded
 or
 even
 35%


compounded
 over
 the
 next
 couple
 years,


you
 know,
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 that


many
 companies
 that
 are
 actually
 guiding


to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that.
 And
 Pounder


hasn't
 guided
 for
 the
 next
 couple
 years


to
 do
 that,
 but
 they
 only
 have
 900


customers.
 I
 mean
 it
 would
 not
 be
 crazy


for
 them
 to
 actually
 give
 a
 guide


reg


uh
 with
 those
 stocks.


>> He's
 a
 buyer
 of
 the
 dip.
 No
 surprise.


Very
 bullish.
 But
 but
 made
 the
 point


that
 they're
 showing
 mild
 concern.
 You


know,
 we're
 not
 seeing
 any
 kind
 of
 like


screaming
 warning
 signs,
 which
 is
 a


place
 you
 would
 see
 it
 in
 the
 high
 yield


market.
 The
 options
 adjusted
 spread
 is


at
 325
 wider,
 which
 is
 off
 the
 August


lows,
 but
 is
 not
 even
 close
 to
 how
 wide


it
 blew
 out
 during
 the
 April
 2nd


liberation
 day,
 right?
 You
 know,
 when


when
 there
 was
 a
 big
 cause.


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 think
 anybody's
 expecting


a
 massive
 default
 cycle
 here,
 right,


Sarah?
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 part
 of
 what


the
 story
 is.
 It's
 it
 goes
 more
 to
 well,


have
 underwriting
 standards
 fallen
 to
 a


certain
 extent?
 Were
 we
 going
 to
 see


more
 fraud
 because
 things
 were
 not


disclosed
 and
 and
 ultimately
 the
 banks


were
 not
 looking
 as
 closely
 as
 perhaps


they
 should
 have
 at
 some
 of
 the


portfolios
 or
 things
 that
 they
 they


didn't
 know
 very
 well
 could
 be,
 but
 it's


not
 a
 systemic
 risk
 for
 the
 system.


>> No,
 wouldn't
 seem
 to
 be.


>> There's
 even
 a
 case
 that's
 made
 about


high
 yield
 spreads,
 right?
 That's
 public


debt
 that
 essentially
 um
 there's
 kind
 of


a
 the
 riskier
 stuff
 is
 gone
 elsewhere


outside
 of
 of
 those
 types
 of
 of
 bonds.


And
 so
 therefore,
 that's
 kind
 of


flattering
 the
 the
 credit
 picture
 a


little
 bit.
 So
 again,
 I
 think
 I
 think


we're
 all
 on
 the
 same
 page
 and
 it's
 not


like
 there's
 any
 kind
 of
 real
 uh


smoldering
 uh
 you
 know,
 disaster
 that's


going
 on
 here,
 but
 it's
 you
 know,
 when


you
 have
 the
 market
 that's
 sort
 of


priced
 itself
 for
 a
 pretty
 pristine


outlook,
 you
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a


>> Well,
 and
 that
 So
 what
 So
 what
 did
 Zions


exactly
 announce?
 What
 was
 it?
 $50


million
 $60
 million
 hit
 and
 and
 then


they
 took
 a
 billion
 dollars
 off
 the


market
 cap.


>> Yeah.
 Which
 is
 why
 you've
 got
 some


upgrades.
 I
 know
 one
 of
 them
 today


billion
 dollar
 market
 cap
 loss
 over
 50


million
 seems
 a
 loss
 seems
 excessive.


Yeah.
 And
 that
 was


>> that
 was
 bared
 uh
 as
 well
 saying
 that.


So


>> there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 deep
 conviction
 or


trust
 in
 regional
 banks
 as
 a
 category,


right?
 They're
 not
 like
 there's
 nothing


special
 about
 most
 of
 them
 and
 so
 they


are
 just
 kind
 of
 broad
 sectoral
 cyclical


plays.
 So
 I
 do
 think
 that
 there's
 a


self-
 first
 instinct
 whether
 it's


justified
 or
 not.


>> But
 I
 thought
 they
 were
 special
 now


because
 now
 they
 can
 merge
 and
 they
 can


>> No,
 no,
 but
 they're
 special
 in
 the
 sense


of
 they
 have
 options.
 But
 I
 mean
 in


terms
 of
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 oh
 Zans
 has
 IP


that
 we
 really
 want
 to
 own
 and
 it


deserves
 a
 premium.
 I
 mean
 no
 offense.


By
 the
 way,
 Z
 and
 Western
 Alliance
 were


two
 of
 the
 banks
 that
 were
 certainly


every
 day
 were
 getting
 crushed
 during


the
 mini
 banking
 crisis
 of
 of
 March
 of


2023.
 Uh,


>> okay.
 So,
 let
 me
 know
 if
 the
 audio
 is


okay,
 guys.
 But,
 uh,
 basically
 the


argument
 that
 they
 are
 making
 right


there
 is
 that
 the
 regionals
 are
 the


first
 thing
 that
 will
 be
 sold


>> and
 the
 reason
 the
 regionals
 are
 the


first
 thing
 that
 will
 be
 sold
 is
 because


people
 don't
 have
 that
 much
 faith
 in
 the


regionals.
 Now,
 I
 don't
 think
 people


don't
 have
 faith
 in
 the
 regionals.
 I


think
 in
 in
 a
 portfolio,
 same
 thing
 like


with
 Bitcoin.
 I
 mean,
 when
 people
 look


for
 liquidity,
 they
 they
 sell
 first
 and


and
 investigate
 later.
 And


unfortunately,
 that's
 been
 happening


with
 Bitcoin
 and,
 you
 know,
 all
 the


other
 crypto
 assets.
 But,
 yeah,
 it's


understandable
 that
 people
 sell
 off


regionals
 in
 terms
 of
 being
 able
 to


raise
 capital.
 Zion's
 announcing
 a
 $50


million
 charge
 off
 and
 then
 getting
 a


billion
 dollar
 wiped
 out
 of
 their
 market


cap.
 That's
 obviously
 fear
 of
 like
 what


could
 happen.
 But
 if
 it's
 not
 a


structural
 problem
 with
 credit,
 then
 it


becomes
 a
 nothing
 burger.
 Especially


with
 the
 regional
 banks
 that
 reported


today,
 their
 their
 credit
 provision


losses
 were
 way
 lower
 than
 expected,
 as


we
 talked
 about
 10
 minutes
 ago.
 So


again,
 it
 just
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 you


should
 run
 for
 the
 hills
 because


regionals
 suck.
 Maybe
 there's
 something


else
 going
 on,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 that


should
 be
 the
 broader
 problem
 with
 with


the
 market.
 So
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 with


regionals.
 Now,
 Bitcoin,
 unfortunately,


has
 just
 been
 horrible.
 I
 would
 love
 to


know
 in
 the
 chat,
 let
 me
 do
 the
 red
 or


green
 poll
 as
 well
 for
 today.
 Why
 do
 we


think
 that
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 or
 let's


just
 say
 Bitcoin
 in
 general
 because


Ethereum
 quite
 frankly
 follows
 Bitcoin.


Why
 do
 we
 think
 that
 Bitcoin
 is
 not


moving?
 Why
 do
 we
 think
 that
 this
 thing


has
 been
 as
 ugly
 as
 it's
 been
 over
 the


past
 couple
 weeks?


Green
 or
 red
 today?


Green
 or
 red?
 Let's
 see.
 Like
 is
 it
 like


this
 is
 supposed
 to
 be
 October
 by
 the


way?
 This
 might
 be
 if
 Bitcoin
 can't
 get


back
 to
 Let
 me
 get
 the
 exact
 price
 right


here.
 Bitcoin
 needs
 to
 get
 back
 to


Oh
 wow,
 dude.
 Bitcoin
 needs
 to
 get
 back


to
 115,000


for
 us
 to
 not
 have
 the
 second
 green


October
 or
 second
 red
 October
 in
 the


past
 12
 years.
 Usually,
 there's
 only


been
 one
 October
 that
 Bitcoin
 has
 been


red
 in
 the
 past
 10
 years.
 This
 would
 be


the
 second
 if
 we
 don't
 get
 back
 to
 115


by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 month.
 So,
 we
 have
 14


days
 to
 get
 there.
 Maybe
 it
 does,
 maybe


she
 doesn't.
 But
 I
 mean,
 it's
 kind
 of


wild,
 right?
 It's
 supposed
 to
 be


October,
 supposed
 to
 be
 Bitcoin
 getting


momentum.
 It's
 just
 not.


It's
 just
 not
 getting
 there.
 People
 are


preparing
 cash.
 People
 are
 afraid
 of


uh
 geopolitics.
 Binance
 had
 a
 lot
 of


issues.
 That's
 fair.


Um


risk
 off.
 People
 are
 pumping
 gold


instead.


Top
 is
 in.
 Dude,
 I
 mean,
 you
 got
 your


Tom
 Lee
 saying
 250
 the
 end
 of
 year.
 We


topped
 out
 at
 126.
 That
 would
 be
 a


little
 ugly.


Maybe
 it's
 waiting
 for
 rate
 cuts
 as


well.
 Maybe
 that's
 what's
 happening.


Yeah,
 opex
 is
 going to
 be
 important


today
 as
 well.
 So,
 options
 are
 expiring


across
 the
 board.
 You're
 going
 to
 have


probably
 hundreds
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars


of
 options
 expire
 because
 today's
 a


Friday,
 so
 that
 could
 also
 just
 make


things
 a
 little
 weird
 today.


Um,


yeah,
 dude.
 It's
 weird.
 It
 hasn't
 been


like
 what
 people
 thought
 it
 would
 be.
 It


really
 hasn't.
 But
 we
 got
 to
 see.


Bitcoin
 is
 not
 a
 real
 hedge
 like
 gold.
 I


mean,
 I
 I
 think
 dude,
 objectively,
 this


is
 not
 even
 like
 debatable.
 Bitcoin
 is


not
 becoming
 a
 hedge.
 It
 is
 becoming
 a


hedge
 long
 term
 if
 you
 disagree
 with
 the


currency
 debasement
 issues.
 And
 and
 that


means
 you
 you
 buy
 it
 and
 you
 just
 don't


look
 at
 it.
 But
 as
 a
 as
 a
 as
 a
 um
 like


manager
 of
 the
 portfolio
 that
 adopts
 a


strategy
 weekly,
 monthly
 or
 daily,
 it's


not
 a
 hedge,
 bro.
 It
 becomes
 the
 first


thing
 you
 liquidate.
 It's
 just
 we're


seeing
 it
 in
 the
 price.
 Whenever
 bad


news
 comes
 out,
 this
 thing
 goes
 down
 and


it
 eventually
 recovers
 over
 time.
 But


it
 is
 quite
 fascinating
 to
 see
 the
 year


it's
 had.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 Micro


Strategy
 has
 been
 horrible
 this
 year.


Micro
 Strategy
 had
 278
 right
 here.
 It


got
 to
 what
 271
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 at


one
 point.


AS
 was
 at
 100
 yesterday.
 That's
 at
 84.


That
 got
 hit.
 Rocket
 Lab
 actually
 is


kind
 of
 holding
 in
 the
 mid60s.
 65.
 Yeah,


I
 was
 at
 73.9
 yesterday.


If
 you've
 owned
 Bitcoin
 for
 at least


four
 years,
 yes,
 you've
 done
 okay.


It's
 just
 in
 the
 short
 term,
 it
 doesn't


operate
 as
 that
 easy
 hedge.


Uh
 I'm
 just
 sad
 that
 Bernie
 made
 up


isn't
 here
 to
 see
 this.


Amit,
 are
 you
 grabbing
 more
 grab?
 Yeah,


I
 bought
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 already.
 I


bought
 at
 565
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 I


mean,
 this
 is
 becoming
 stupid
 in
 my


opinion.
 Like,
 based
 on
 the
 work
 I've


done
 on
 anal
 on
 analyzing
 the
 valuation


of
 the
 company,
 this
 is
 just
 becoming


dumb.
 But
 I
 also
 understand
 that
 if
 the


S&P
 takes
 a
 hit,
 if
 Robinet
 takes
 a
 hit,


if
 SoFi
 takes
 a
 hit,
 if
 AMD
 takes
 a
 hit,


AMD
 from
 240
 to
 230,
 Grab's
 going
 to


take
 a
 hit,
 regardless
 of
 if
 it's


justified
 or
 not.
 And
 so
 to
 me,
 this
 is


when
 I
 double
 down
 on
 the
 names
 I'm


convicted
 in.
 And
 I
 also
 double
 down
 on


things
 that
 I
 know
 are
 safe.
 This


company
 has
 7
 billion
 in
 cash
 and


profitable.
 It's
 safer
 to
 me.
 It's
 not


going
 to
 run
 like
 an
 Oaklow,
 but
 I
 can


sleep
 well
 at
 night
 knowing
 I
 have
 those


shares.
 And
 I
 think
 at
 this
 time
 of
 the


of
 the
 year,
 like
 it's
 really
 important


to
 double
 down
 on
 [ __ ]
 that
 you
 think
 is


safe.
 Amazon
 also
 very
 safe.
 I
 bought


the
 dip
 yesterday
 on
 Amazon
 21455.


Um,
 I
 think
 my
 cost
 base
 is
 now
 217,
 but


like


it's
 safer
 to
 me
 than
 a
 lot
 of
 other


players
 in
 the
 market,


but
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 horrible.
 Uh,


Boft
 says,
 "I'm
 out
 of
 HIMS
 complete."


Oh,
 yeah,
 dude.
 That
 was
 not
 the
 best


look.
 So,
 Andrew
 Dutam
 sold
 him


yesterday.
 He
 sold
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of


shares.


Um,
 and
 it
 was
 just
 weird,
 bro,
 because


he
 sold
 shares,
 but
 he
 also
 posted
 this


thing
 yesterday.


this
 this
 uh
 I
 emoji
 on
 someone
 saying


the
 HIM
 squeeze
 is
 there
 and
 then
 bro


files
 to
 sell
 $11
 million
 worth
 of


shares.
 Now
 look,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 didn't


really
 uh
 well
 I
 could
 just
 say
 a
 lot
 of


people
 in
 the
 Hims
 community
 didn't
 love


my
 uh
 comments
 that
 I
 made
 yesterday


saying
 that
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 cringe
 and


they're
 like
 well
 what
 about
 when
 Karp


says
 to
 burn
 the
 shorts
 and
 what
 about


when
 Elon
 says
 this
 and
 that.
 I'm
 like


look
 okay
 I
 will
 give
 you
 the
 point
 that


yes
 Karp
 and
 Elon
 are
 also
 eclectic
 and


eccentric
 and
 they
 will
 say
 things


publicly
 on
 television
 and
 stuff.
 Elon


More
 through
 Twitter
 and
 it
 can
 be
 kind


of
 weird,
 right?
 Especially
 to
 the


conventional
 shareholder.
 However,
 my


retort
 to
 that
 is
 as
 follows.
 Number


one,
 Karp
 and
 Elon
 are
 weird
 people.


They
 are
 able
 to
 get
 away
 with
 being


weird.
 Like
 like
 there's
 also
 something


about
 reading
 the
 room,
 right?
 Like
 Karp


and
 Elon
 are
 weird.
 They
 people
 know


they're
 weird.
 That
 like
 their
 entire


brand
 is
 being
 weird
 and
 that
 you
 know


that
 kind
 of
 makes
 them
 who
 they
 are.
 So


like
 the
 Andrew
 Dutam
 is
 not
 some
 weird


guy.
 is
 just
 some
 regular
 dude
 who


operates.
 Like
 it's
 just
 it
 it
 becomes


weird
 when
 you
 do
 things
 that
 are


actually
 weird
 and
 cringe
 when
 you're


not
 perceived
 as
 weird
 and
 cringe.
 And
 I


know
 that
 logic
 may
 sound


counterintuitive,
 but
 that
 is
 something


that
 that
 that
 is
 just
 the
 reality
 of


like
 the
 world
 that
 we
 live
 in
 right


here.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 one
 point.


Number
 two
 is
 that
 look,
 Karp
 saying


we're
 going
 to
 burn
 the
 shorts
 or
 we're


going
 to,
 you
 know,
 take
 the
 short


sellers
 to
 to
 get
 their
 cocaine
 on
 CNBC


in
 a
 in
 a
 interview
 with
 Sarah
 Eisman.


It's
 the
 most
 carp
 thing
 ever
 because


he's
 already
 such
 a
 This
 guy
 writes


philosophical
 shareholder
 letters
 and


he's
 done
 it
 for
 the
 past
 14
 quarters


and
 he
 goes
 on
 these
 rambles
 and
 rants.


His
 mind
 just
 goes
 somewhere
 and
 you


know
 that
 stuff
 ends
 up
 coming
 out
 of


his
 mouth.
 He
 does
 not
 have
 a
 Twitter


account
 that
 is
 quoting
 me
 saying,
 "Oh,


I
 think
 Palanteer
 is
 getting
 squeezed


with
 a
 I
 emoji."
 Because
 that
 [ __ ]
 is


just
 cringe.
 It's
 just
 cringe,
 bro.
 It's


cringe
 in
 a
 different
 way.
 And
 look,
 the


the
 Coke
 short
 sellers,
 I
 didn't
 think


that
 comment
 was
 cringe
 because,
 you


know,
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 pretty
 cool
 the


way
 he
 was
 saying
 it,
 especially
 given


the
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 personality
 that


Carp
 has,
 but
 other
 people
 thought
 it


was
 cringe.
 That's
 fair.
 You're
 allowed


to
 think
 that
 that's
 cringe.
 I'm
 also


allowed
 to
 think
 that
 what
 Dutam's
 doing


is
 really
 weird,
 especially
 right
 when


you're
 about
 to
 sell
 $11
 million
 worth


of
 stock.


It's
 not
 a
 bare
 case
 for
 him,
 right?
 I


already
 said
 it's
 not
 a
 bear
 case
 for


him.
 It's
 just
 not
 a
 good
 look.


It's
 just
 not
 a
 good
 look.
 And
 I
 know
 a


lot
 of
 the
 AMS
 people
 aren't
 going to


agree
 with
 me
 on
 this
 and
 they're
 going


to
 think
 I'm
 being
 a
 hypocrite
 or


whatever.
 CT
 says
 amid
 is
 weird.
 That's


why
 we
 love.
 Yeah,
 dude.
 I
 can
 make


certain
 jokes
 because
 I'm
 perceived
 as


weird


in
 certain
 way.
 Like
 I
 can
 mispronounce


certain
 words
 and
 get
 away
 with
 it.


And
 and
 like
 and
 you
 know
 you
 guys
 you


guys
 will
 give
 me
 [ __ ]
 but
 you
 won't


give
 me
 that
 much
 [ __ ]
 because
 you
 know


that
 like
 like
 I
 can
 call
 the
 European
 U


EU
 Commission
 president
 Lagard
 because


you
 guys
 know
 that.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 to


talk,
 right?
 And
 so
 like
 I
 can
 get
 away


with
 that.
 But
 if
 you're
 some


professional
 like
 CNBC
 host
 or


something,
 you
 can't
 get
 away
 with
 that


[ __ ]
 because
 people
 were
 like,
 "What?


Why
 can't
 you
 say
 her
 name
 correctly?"


It's
 it's
 the
 thing
 is
 it's
 just
 weird


to
 do
 it
 on
 Twitter
 of
 all
 places
 and


then
 sell
 the
 day
 after.
 Not
 a
 bare
 case


for
 him.
 It's
 it's
 I
 don't
 know.
 It's


just
 not
 the
 best
 look.
 And
 I'm
 not
 the


only
 one.
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 him
 people
 may


disagree
 with
 me
 and
 they
 think
 I'm


being
 too
 nitpicky,
 but
 if
 you
 just
 look


at
 objectively
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 people


talking
 about
 this
 on
 Twitter,
 it
 it


really
 looks
 weird.
 It's
 not
 something


that
 people
 love.


But
 regardless,
 those
 are
 those
 are
 my


thoughts.


It
 might
 be
 a
 weak
 argument.
 You
 look,


it
 might
 be
 if
 you're
 super
 into
 him,


you
 probably
 don't
 care
 about
 that


argument
 either.
 I'm
 just
 I'm
 just


saying
 in
 the
 back
 of
 your
 head,
 even
 if


you're
 a
 him
 shareholder,
 like
 the
 thing


when
 Cart
 made
 those
 coke
 seller
 uh


short
 seller
 comments
 and
 you
 know


they're
 going
 to
 do
 cocaine
 like
 like


almost
 95%
 of
 the
 pounder
 investor
 base


was
 like,
 "Yeah,
 bro."
 Like
 like like


it's
 it
 it
 riled
 you
 up.
 It
 gave
 you


energy.
 I
 don't
 know
 of
 90
 I
 mean
 Nate


Nate's
 a
 good
 friend
 of
 mine.
 Nate's


been
 preaching
 to
 him.
 Nate
 is
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 I
 bought
 him
 in
 the
 first


place.
 Nate
 was
 like,
 "Dude,
 this
 [ __ ]


is
 weird.
 Why
 is
 he
 quoting
 some
 random


guy
 on
 Twitter
 saying
 that
 Hims
 is
 going


to
 squeeze
 and
 then
 he's
 freaking


selling
 stock
 the
 day
 after?"
 Like,
 even


Nate
 was
 like, "I
 don't
 I
 don't


understand
 why
 this
 is
 happening."


But
 regardless,
 it
 doesn't
 really
 matter


that
 much.
 Hims
 will
 be
 fine
 long
 term


if
 they
 keep
 executing.


AMD
 price
 target
 right
 there,
 250
 to


300.
 That's
 what
 you
 got
 on
 AMD.
 So,
 you


do
 have
 an
 upgrade
 right
 there
 by
 Bank


of America
 Securities.
 HIMS
 uh
 did
 get
 a


well
 I
 mean
 HIMS
 didn't
 get
 an
 upgrade


they
 got
 a
 sell
 rating
 from
 Bank
 of


America
 a
 reiteration
 of
 that
 cell


rating
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 Bank
 of


America
 just
 hates
 HIMS
 but
 they
 really


do
 hate
 HIMS.
 So
 uh
 they
 like
 AMD
 they


like
 Nvidia
 they
 don't
 really
 love
 HIMS.


Micron
 also
 doing
 okay.
 Oh
 yeah
 this
 was


another
 headline
 this
 morning.
 Micron


New
 York
 approves
 power
 line
 for


Micron's
 100
 billion
 semiconductor
 power


plant.
 you're
 getting
 more
 of
 the
 uh


local
 governments
 and
 jurisdictions


starting
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 more
 friendly,
 I


guess
 you
 could
 say,
 to
 the
 companies


that
 are
 building
 out
 these
 data
 centers


and
 semiconductor
 ecosystems.
 Micron


right
 there,
 200
 in
 the
 pre-markets,


which
 is
 also


pretty
 nice
 to
 see
 as
 well.
 Now,
 here's


a
 stat
 that
 I
 think
 is
 also
 really


important.
 We
 got
 about
 7
 minutes
 into


the
 market
 opens.
 Take
 a
 look
 at
 this.


Poly
 markets
 data,
 this
 is
 what
 they
 put


out
 yesterday,
 shows
 how
 close
 they
 are


to
 truth
 in
 real
 time
 across
 thousands


of
 markets.
 Accur
 sits
 at
 or
 accuracy


sits
 at
 91%
 even
 a
 month
 before
 a


resolution
 comes
 out
 and
 a
 95%
 just
 four


hours
 out.
 So
 poly
 market
 is
 pricing
 in


a
 97%
 chance
 or
 it
 might
 be
 college.


It's
 one
 of
 those
 uh
 that
 Michael
 Sailor


will
 be
 on
 the
 Joe
 Rogan
 podcast
 which


by
 the
 way
 Palmer
 Lucky
 was
 on
 it


yesterday.
 And
 I
 mean,
 look,
 if
 someone


told
 me
 Michael
 Sale
 was
 going to
 be
 on


Joe
 Rogan,
 I
 wouldn't
 believe
 them.
 I'd


be
 like,
 uh,
 it's
 probably
 not


happening.
 Like,
 you
 know,
 like,
 where's


your
 source
 for
 that?
 But
 if
 Kali
 is


saying
 there's
 a
 97%
 chance
 that
 it


happens,
 I
 start
 to
 believe
 it
 because


the
 accuracy
 of
 the
 the
 wisdom
 of
 the


crowd's
 thesis
 is
 like
 becoming
 much


more
 real
 than
 not.
 So,
 it's
 quite


incredible
 to
 see
 that
 playing
 out.
 And,


uh,
 you
 know,
 hopefully
 that
 ends
 up


actually
 happening.
 But,
 these


prediction
 markets
 are
 becoming
 more
 and


more
 important.
 And
 it
 looks
 like
 they


can't
 be
 denied.
 Uh
 Oracle
 executives


says
 AI
 infrastructure
 has
 se
 has
 seen
 a


117%
 growth
 rate
 year-over-year
 in
 Q1
 of


2026
 which
 is
 next
 quarter.
 Oracle


executives
 yesterday
 also
 said
 cloud


infrastructure
 revenue
 is
 expected
 to
 be


166
 billion
 by
 fiscal
 year
 2030.
 So
 they


are
 giving
 more
 guidance
 across
 the


board
 on
 what's
 happening
 with
 Oracle


and
 what's
 happening
 you
 know
 with
 their


remaining
 performance
 obligations.
 By


the
 way
 that
 RPO
 growth
 that
 was
 up
 350%


yesterday
 at
 their
 Oracle
 conference


they
 said
 that
 RPO
 growth
 is
 now
 up
 500%


going
 into
 2030


which
 is
 pretty
 crazy.
 So,
 if
 you


believe
 that
 they're
 actually
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 get
 those
 contracts,
 then
 you


are
 getting


some
 momentum
 into
 what
 could
 happen


with
 uh
 Oracle.
 Apple
 won
 F1's
 US


broadcast
 rights
 with
 a
 landmark
 5-year


deal.
 So,
 now
 on
 Apple
 TV,
 you
 will
 be


able
 to
 watch
 Formula
 1.
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


honest,
 I've
 never
 seen
 Formula
 1


before.
 I
 haven't
 even
 seen
 the
 movie


with
 Brad
 Pitt.
 I
 like
 I've
 really
 never


been
 into
 racing
 or
 like
 seeing
 cars


race
 each
 other.
 So
 I
 I've
 like
 never


watched
 it,
 but
 I
 guess
 Formula
 1
 is
 a


massive
 massive
 sport
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people


and
 yeah,
 Apple
 looks
 like
 they
 got
 I


think
 I
 mean
 Steve
 has
 said
 this
 so
 many


times.
 Apple
 should
 be
 buying
 so
 many


sports
 rights
 and
 integrating
 them
 into


their
 ecosystem.
 I
 mean,
 imagine
 if


Apple
 bought
 Mass
 and
 Square
 Garden
 as


Steve
 has
 mentioned
 before
 and
 they
 had


access
 to
 all
 the
 New
 York
 games,
 all


the
 live
 shows
 and
 concerts
 and
 they


could
 integrate
 it
 into
 maybe
 the
 Vision


Pro
 to
 make
 it
 something
 that's
 more


compelling.


Apple
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 cash
 outside
 of


buying
 back
 their
 stock.
 I
 mean,
 getting


media
 rights
 to
 be
 able
 to
 make
 their


products
 more
 compelling
 and
 just
 more


sticky.
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 not
 crazy,


but
 that
 is
 one
 thing
 Apple's
 doing
 with


uh
 with
 F1.
 Okay,
 here's
 an
 update
 from


Catchy
 BT
 last
 night,
 OpenAI,
 that
 I


thought
 was
 also
 pretty
 interesting.
 So,


for
 those
 that
 are
 on
 Sora,
 okay,
 you


can
 basically
 take
 any
 historical


character
 and
 uh
 get
 them
 to
 do
 whatever


you
 want
 them
 to
 do.
 So,
 people
 were


taking
 Martin
 Luther
 King
 Jr.'s
 I
 have
 a


dream
 speech


and
 well,
 they
 were
 applying
 AI
 to
 it.


And
 uh
 Dr.
 MLK
 Jr.
 was
 saying
 some


things
 that
 you
 probably
 I've
 seen
 some


of
 the
 videos
 and
 I
 I
 cannot
 deny
 how


hilarious
 some
 of
 them
 are.
 But


nonetheless,
 it
 pissed
 off
 the
 estate.


And
 OpenAI
 comes
 out
 yesterday
 and
 says,


"Hey,
 some
 users
 generated
 disrespectful


depictions
 of
 Dr.
 King's
 image."
 So
 at


King's
 Inc.'s
 request,
 OpenAI
 has
 paused


generations
 depicting
 Dr.
 King
 as
 it


strengthens
 guard
 rails
 for
 historical


figures.


Okay.
 Now,
 here's
 my
 take
 on
 this.
 First


of
 all,
 obviously,
 if
 uh
 the
 estate
 of


MLK
 Jr.
 doesn't
 want
 like
 that
 type
 of


content
 being
 put,
 I
 think
 open
 should


respect
 that,
 right?
 I
 think
 that
 that


that
 makes
 sense.
 And
 like,
 you
 know,


given
 how
 crazy
 AI
 can
 become,
 that
 can


end
 up
 resulting
 in
 some
 horrible


content.
 But
 here's
 my
 take,
 and
 here's


why
 I'm
 thinking
 Sam
 Al
 Sam
 Alman
 is


just
 ruthless.


How
 did
 he
 not
 know
 he's
 either
 ruthless


or
 he's
 an
 idiot?
 Or
 maybe
 he
 just


doesn't
 care.
 How
 did
 you
 not
 know
 that


if
 you
 license
 historical
 figures
 to


teenagers
 that
 are
 joining
 Sora
 that


don't
 have
 their
 brains
 developed
 that


will
 type
 in
 these
 prompts
 that
 make


these
 historical
 figures
 say
 and
 do


ridiculous
 things
 that
 this
 wouldn't


happen?
 Like,
 how
 would
 you
 how
 did
 you


not
 know
 this
 obviously
 would
 happen?


It's
 almost
 just
 it
 really
 makes
 me


think
 these
 guys
 don't
 understand
 or


care
 that
 much
 about
 safety
 because
 to


to
 not
 think
 that
 yeah,
 if
 we
 license


one
 of
 the
 most
 prominent
 civil
 rights


historical
 figures
 of
 all
 time
 to
 the


public,
 the
 public
 would
 manipulate
 the


the
 likely
 the
 likeliness
 of
 of
 of
 that


historical
 figure
 in
 a
 weird
 AI
 way.
 Oh


yeah,
 let's
 just
 let
 that
 happen.
 And


you
 know,
 and
 it's
 one
 thing
 to
 say
 move


fast
 and
 break
 things.
 It's
 another


thing
 to
 be
 like
 that's
 just
 stupid.
 And


then
 here's
 the
 follow-up
 question.
 What


if
 Kim
 Kardashian
 comes
 out
 and
 says,
 "I


don't
 like
 how
 people
 are
 using
 my


likeliness."


What
 if
 Brad
 Pit
 comes
 out
 and
 says,


"Dude,
 I
 don't
 like
 this
 AI
 [ __ ]
 Like,


I
 have
 a
 reputation.
 I'm
 an
 actor.
 I


like
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 have
 a
 public


perception
 and
 now
 the
 Sora
 app
 is


feeding
 all
 these
 thousands
 of
 people


different
 versions
 of
 me
 talking
 in


different
 ways."
 Like,
 at
 what
 point


does
 this
 become
 a
 censorship
 debate


versus
 a
 free
 speech
 debate?
 At
 what


point
 does
 the
 government
 get
 involved


and
 say,
 "Hey,
 there's
 copyright
 laws
 on


people's
 own
 individual
 personalities


that,
 you
 know,
 don't
 that
 shouldn't
 be


allowed
 to
 be
 depicted
 in
 this
 way.


It's
 it's
 it's
 it's
 very
 weird
 and
 I


think
 OpenAI
 trying
 to
 be
 LZ
 fair
 about


it,
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 work.
 But
 the
 fact


that
 they
 even
 tried
 in
 the
 first
 place,


not
 expecting
 the
 push
 back
 they
 would


get


and
 now
 they
 got
 the
 push
 back
 is
 is
 a


weird
 issue.
 And
 I
 I
 can
 just
 imagine


the
 lawsuits,
 bro,
 across
 the
 board.
 And


also,
 forget
 just
 the
 legal
 aspect
 of


it.
 If
 you're
 Sam
 Alman,
 do
 you
 really


want
 to
 piss
 off
 the
 estate
 of
 Dr.
 MLK


Jr.?
 Do
 you
 want
 to
 piss
 off
 all
 these


pop
 culture
 icons
 and
 get
 them
 opposed


to
 never
 like
 touching
 your
 AI
 product


because
 you're
 allowing
 people
 to
 do


this?


Doesn't
 seem
 like
 that
 makes
 much
 sense,


but
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 another
 problem


that,
 you
 know,
 the
 overall
 ecosystem
 of


AI
 is
 going
 to
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 long


term.
 And
 I
 guess
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how


this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 All right,


folks.
 Here
 we
 go.
 We
 got
 about
 20


seconds
 until
 the
 market
 opens.
 Thank


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 It
 is
 Friday


at
 2
 a.m.
 We
 were
 deep,
 deep
 red.
 An


hour
 ago,
 Trump
 said,
 "We're
 not
 going


to
 put
 tariffs
 on
 China
 and
 we'll
 try
 to


get
 a
 deal
 by
 next
 week."
 that
 reversed


pretty
 much
 everything.
 Let's
 see
 as
 the


market
 opens
 up
 what
 happens
 and
 if
 we


end
 up
 getting
 to
 buy
 the
 dip
 or
 if
 the


market
 continues
 to
 sell
 off.
 It
 is
 9:30


a.m.
 Friday,
 October
 17th.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 The
 stock


market
 is
 now
 open.


All right.
 Wake
 your
 ass
 up.
 Let's
 get


into
 it.
 S&P
 down
 on
 the
 day,
 not
 down


that
 much,
 but
 we
 are
 red.
 Grab
 goes


down
 1.3%.
 SoFi
 down
 1%.
 AMD
 down
 1%.


Nvidia
 down
 1%.
 Tessy
 down
 1%.
 Pounder


down
 1%.
 Hoodie
 down
 2.3.
 Reddit's
 down


2.4.
 Amazon's
 actually
 flat.
 It's
 down


the
 least
 out
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names,


but
 still
 is
 red.
 Meta
 is
 down
 half
 a


percent.
 Salesforce
 is
 flat.
 PayPal's


down
 the
 third.
 Apple's
 actually
 green.


Bitcoin
 105
 at
 3
 and
 4700.
 Bit
 mine's


probably
 at
 51.
 Bit
 mine
 is
 at,
 never


mind,
 4950.
 It
 did
 get
 to
 47,
 I
 think,


in
 the
 pre-markets.
 So,
 Bit
 Mine
 taking


a
 hit.
 Crowd
 Strikes
 down
 one.
 Coinbase


down
 three.
 Rocket
 Labs
 down
 1.3.
 Micro


Strategy


down
 one,
 but
 up
 from
 the
 pre-markets.


S&P
 still
 down
 0.2.
 So,
 it's
 not
 like


we're
 out
 of
 the
 woods
 by
 any
 sense
 of


the
 imagination,
 although
 this
 was
 way


worse
 at
 2
 a.m.


Uh,
 so
 it's
 a
 little
 recovery,
 but
 not


as
 nice
 of
 a
 recovery.
 Nvidia
 right
 here


down
 1%.
 Tesla
 down
 half.
 Baba's
 down


two.
 VIX
 is


down
 but
 still
 right
 below
 25.
 It
 closed


above
 25
 yesterday,
 but
 2460
 is
 uh
 where


the
 VIX
 is
 at
 right
 now.
 Walmart
 right


there
 down
 about
 half
 a
 percent.
 Lyft
 is


also
 down
 1.2%.
 Coreweave
 down
 3.5.


Coinbase
 down
 two.
 Crowd
 Strike
 down


one.
 The
 VIX
 is
 down
 but
 still
 pretty
 up


on
 the
 day.
 And
 then
 new
 bank
 right
 here


that
 is
 also
 down
 about
 half
 a
 percent


on
 the
 day.
 Where's
 Amcor?
 This
 one
 has


held
 up
 at
 31.
 You
 know,
 not
 horrible.


It's
 held
 up
 okay,
 but
 you're
 still


getting
 some
 pain.
 S&P
 500
 right
 there


trying
 to
 recover.
 6590.


Might
 be
 going
 green.
 There's
 that


candle
 right
 there.
 Maybe
 we
 get
 it.
 But


everything
 else
 still
 pretty
 red.


Oracle,
 are
 we
 getting
 hit?
 Oracle,
 we


got
 hit.
 Oracle
 298.
 That's
 down.
 Oracle


is
 indeed
 down
 297
 up
 from
 or
 down
 from


302
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 Tesla
 again


still
 going
 down.
 Salesforce
 is
 down.


ASS
 this
 was
 at
 102
 yesterday.
 AS
 is


8449.
 Let's
 look
 at
 the
 rare
 earth


stocks.
 Rare
 earths
 are
 down
 all
 of
 them


across
 the
 board
 continuing
 their
 pain


from
 yesterday.
 How
 about
 the
 Bitcoin


miners?
 They
 are
 all
 red
 although
 Iran


pretty
 decent
 recovery.
 It
 was
 at
 54
 in


the
 pre-markets.
 It's
 at
 60
 now.
 So


that's
 not
 too
 bad.
 At
 least
 you
 got


some
 juice
 right
 there.
 That's
 still


down
 1%.
 Bit
 Farms
 502.
 This
 thing
 was


at
 650
 yesterday.
 Marathon's
 down.


Riot's
 down.
 Galaxy
 is
 down.
 Clean


Spark's
 down.
 Cipher
 is
 also
 down.
 Rock


Lab
 went
 green.
 Rocket
 Lab.
 Okay,
 Rock


Lab's
 one
 of
 the
 growth
 names
 that's


going
 green.
 Let's
 see
 if
 that's
 a
 trend


across
 the
 board.
 Maybe
 we
 can
 get
 some


more.
 SoFi
 just
 went
 green
 for
 a
 second.


So
 if
 I
 joined
 the
 party
 for
 a
 little


bit.
 Apple
 still
 holding
 on
 to
 its


green.
 Palo
 Alto
 green,
 but
 pretty
 much


everything
 else
 outside
 of
 Rocket
 Lab
 is


red.
 Verizon
 and
 your
 uh
 your
 value


names
 are
 holding
 up.
 How
 about
 UNH?


UNH
 is
 UNH.
 They
 get
 a
 price
 uh
 target


upgrade
 to
 375
 this
 morning,
 but
 they


are
 also
 down


on
 the
 day.
 What
 about
 Quantum
 QBTS?


Wow,
 down
 another
 5%.


OQ,
 it
 was
 down
 10%
 yesterday,
 down


another
 1%.
 And
 then
 Regetti
 down
 7%.


All
 right,
 so
 all
 the
 quantum
 names


still
 bleeding
 and
 all
 of
 those
 are
 also


down.
 SMCI,
 how
 about
 that
 one?
 Delta
 is


down
 a
 little
 bit.
 SMCI
 is
 down
 about


2%.
 Where
 is
 United
 Airlines?
 They
 had
 a


great
 earnings
 a
 couple
 of
 days
 ago.


That
 one's
 actually
 green.
 IBKR
 also
 had


a
 pretty
 good
 earnings.
 IBKR
 right
 there


65.87.


That
 is
 down


about
 3.87%
 on
 the
 day.
 There
 you
 go.


Google
 right
 there
 1.2.
 And
 then
 Grabby


Grab
 561.
 It
 looks
 like
 she
 wants
 to


break
 560
 as
 she
 continues
 to
 get
 hit.


TLT
 is
 actually
 down,
 which
 means
 the


tenure
 is
 up
 a
 little bit.
 And
 then


Apploving,


that
 one's
 also
 down
 on
 the
 day.


I
 wonder
 how
 this
 turns
 out
 in
 the
 next


hour,
 bro.
 Because


S&P
 is
 about
 to
 go
 green,
 but


everything's
 still
 red.
 It's
 not
 as
 bad


as
 it
 was
 before.
 Grab
 just
 broke
 560.


That
 one's
 getting
 hit.
 Robin
 Hood
 was


almost
 at
 124
 in
 the
 pre-market.
 So,
 I


mean,
 it's
 it's
 gapping
 back
 up
 to
 130,


but
 like,
 can
 that
 actually
 sustain


throughout
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day?
 You
 have


a
 ton
 of
 options
 that
 are
 expiring
 in
 a


few
 hours
 as
 well.
 Nvidia
 breaking
 181.


I
 mean,
 it
 looks
 like
 we're
 trying
 to
 go


green,


but
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 are
 still


getting
 slammed.
 Mr.
 Beast
 has
 filed
 a


trademark
 application
 for
 Mr.
 Beast


Financial,
 planning
 to
 register
 a


company
 to
 provide
 cryptocurrency


trading
 services
 and
 more.


Okay,
 we
 hit
 the
 top.
 That's
 that's


that's
 it.
 That's
 the
 That's
 the


headline.
 does.
 And
 I
 know
 we've
 been


saying
 every
 headline's
 the
 top,
 but


this
 one's
 legit.
 Like,


Mr.
 Beast
 is
 going
 to
 give
 out
 Bitcoin.


Dude,
 what
 freaking
 scam
 crypto
 company


is
 he
 partnering
 with
 to
 How
 much
 did


they
 pay
 him
 to
 do
 this
 [ __ ]
 bro?


Mr.
 Beast
 has
 been
 losing
 some
 aura.
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 lie.
 Over
 the
 past
 couple


years,
 he's
 been
 taking
 some
 deals
 that


are
 just
 like,
 "What
 are
 you
 doing,
 bro?


Why
 are
 you
 doing
 this
 shit?"


I
 don't
 know,
 Mr.
 Beast.
 Really?


All
 right,
 I
 guess
 we'll
 see
 what


happens
 with
 that.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 just


joking
 about
 it
 being
 the
 top,
 but


definitely
 is
 weird
 when
 influencers


like
 that
 get
 involved
 in
 the
 crypto


space.
 Google
 right
 there,
 that's
 down


half
 a
 percent,
 losing
 250
 as
 well.


TripleV,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $200
 super


chat.
 For
 those
 that
 have
 been
 wondering


where
 Triple
 V
 has
 been,
 he's
 been


traveling.
 I
 actually
 uh
 got
 a
 text
 from


Mr.
 Derek
 today
 and
 uh
 Triple
 V,
 he
 told


me
 where
 you
 were,
 so
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,


that's
 why
 he's
 been
 gone
 for
 so
 long."


But
 yeah,
 there
 he
 is.
 Thank
 you
 again


for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Thank
 for
 being


here.
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 if
 he's
 looked


at
 his
 portfolio
 cuz
 he's
 halfway
 across


the
 world
 right
 now
 getting
 some


business
 deals
 done.
 So,
 he
 might
 not
 be


looking
 as
 heavily,
 but
 Google
 right


there
 250
 SoFi
 is
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 and


then
 S&P
 trying
 to
 recover.
 TripleB


again,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat
 and


thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 BMR,
 do
 we
 buy


$49.90?
 I
 mean,


look,
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 Ethereum,
 right?


If
 this
 thing
 breaks
 the
 floor
 at
 around


34
 35,
 which
 was
 its
 low
 last
 week,
 then


this
 thing's
 going
 below
 49.
 If
 it
 holds


up,
 it
 holds
 up.
 I'm
 not
 that
 excited
 to


buy
 the
 BMR
 dip
 because
 I
 already
 have
 a


lot
 of
 BMR.
 Like,
 I
 have
 a
 pretty


sizable
 position.
 So,
 to
 me,
 I'm
 just


like,
 it's
 got
 to
 be
 super
 super


attractive
 to
 want
 to
 buy
 more.
 And
 I'm


not
 saying
 49's
 not
 attractive,
 but
 you


know,
 it's
 not
 like,
 oh
 my
 goodness,


it's
 at
 like
 40
 that's
 attractive.
 Same


thing
 with
 Hood,
 right?
 It's
 like
 again,


Hood's
 got
 to
 give
 me
 something
 really


good
 to
 buy
 because
 I
 already
 have
 a
 big


position.


There's
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where
 you


got
 to
 really
 see
 something.
 Even


Nvidia,
 like
 I've
 wanted
 to
 buy
 more


Nvidia,
 but
 I'm
 like,
 look,
 195
 to
 180


is
 not
 that
 compelling.
 You
 give
 me
 170,


I
 get,
 you
 know,
 back
 to
 being
 excited,


but
 it's
 not
 really
 there.


Um,
 star
 position
 in
 Cipher.
 All right,


so
 we
 got
 some
 people.
 Let
 me
 know
 if


you're
 buying
 the
 dip.
 Who's
 buying
 the


dip
 in
 the
 chat?
 If
 you
 call
 this
 a
 dip,


I
 mean
 S&P
 is
 about
 to
 break
 green,
 so


it's
 a
 dip
 from
 yesterday,
 but
 it's
 not


necessarily
 a
 dip
 dip.


Um,


what
 do
 you
 think
 about
 Grab
 at
 550?
 If


we
 actually
 get
 to
 550,
 I
 will
 buy
 more.


I
 mean,
 we'll
 buy
 a
 lot
 more
 if
 we
 get


there.
 Again,
 this
 is
 one
 of
 my
 my


favorite
 dip
 buys
 in
 the
 market,
 but
 we


got
 to
 see
 if
 we
 actually
 get
 there.
 I


also
 think
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 Grab
 was
 at
 660


last
 week.
 You're
 telling
 me
 it
 deserves


to
 go
 to
 550
 for
 what?
 like
 nothing


fundamental
 about
 the
 company.
 If
 it's


about,
 you
 know,
 China
 stuff,
 then
 okay,


like
 whatever.
 If
 it's
 China
 stuff,
 then


sure.
 But
 like
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 that's


a
 strong
 enough
 reason.
 Oh,
 we're
 going


green.
 Green green.
 Look
 at
 these
 green


candles.
 We're
 getting
 some
 real
 green


right
 here.
 S&P
 661.
 Robin
 Hood
 back
 to


130.
 Nvidia
 almost
 182.
 Even
 Grab
 just


broke
 out
 right
 there
 to
 560.
 SoFi,
 look


at
 that.
 1%
 to
 27.


Did
 Trump
 tweet
 or
 is
 this
 ALOS?
 This


looks
 like
 a
 Trump
 tweet.
 That's
 a


pretty
 violent
 green
 candle
 right
 there.


No
 tweet.
 I
 don't
 see
 any
 update.


Bitcoin.
 Where's
 Bitcoin?
 Okay.
 104
 to


106.
 That's
 a
 $2,000
 candle
 on
 Bitcoin.


That
 also
 helps.


Gold.
 Where's
 gold?


Uh,
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 gold's
 crashing,
 but


gold's
 definitely
 Well,
 no,
 actually,


no,
 gold's
 crashing.
 Okay,
 not
 crashing,


but
 43
 to
 4260.


Let's
 go,
 baby.


Let
 dude,
 that's
 that
 that that
 the
 only


reason
 that's
 good.
 I
 don't
 want
 people


to
 lose
 money
 in
 gold.
 I'm
 just
 saying


that's
 good
 because
 like
 people
 aren't


as
 scared
 as
 they
 were
 piling
 into
 gold.


So,
 they're
 able
 to
 take
 a
 little
 bit


more
 risk
 if
 they're
 selling
 off
 their


gold.


And
 that's
 what
 you're
 saying.
 4350
 to


4260
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 almost
 10
 minutes.


I
 mean,
 that's
 not
 horrible.
 What
 if
 the


real,
 you
 know,
 we
 talking
 about
 all


these
 bubbles?
 What
 if
 the
 real
 bubble


is
 in
 gold?
 What
 if
 the
 real
 bubble
 is


in
 gold,
 bro?
 What
 if
 that's
 where
 the


bubble
 is?


Would
 be
 quite
 incredible
 to
 see.
 Dude,


S&P
 just
 lost
 that
 candle.
 We
 just
 went


to
 661
 and
 we're
 back
 to
 65980
 within


the
 span
 of
 30
 seconds.


Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.
 It
 had
 two


seconds
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 that
 green
 and


then
 it
 just
 got
 wiped
 out.


This
 market's
 being
 ruthless
 right
 now,


dude.
 It's
 being
 ruthless.
 Not
 even


giving
 you
 a
 chance
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 a


little bit
 now.
 No,
 now
 we're
 back
 down


to
 65970.
 It's
 almost
 like
 that
 pop
 to


661
 didn't
 even
 happen.


I
 hate
 the
 stock
 market,
 bro.
 I
 hate
 it.


All
 it
 does
 is
 get
 your
 hopes
 up,
 bro.


That's
 all
 it
 does
 every
 day.
 It's


imaginary
 monopoly
 money.
 It's
 not
 even


real
 money,
 bro.
 It's
 just
 It's
 just


like
 numbers
 on
 a
 screen.
 None
 of
 this


shit's
 real
 unless
 you
 sell.
 It's
 all


fake.
 keeps
 you
 addicted
 to
 looking
 at


candles
 all
 day.
 Candles
 don't
 love
 you.


They
 don't
 care
 about
 you.
 They
 could


care
 less
 about
 you.
 They're
 going
 to
 go


up
 or
 down
 regardless
 of
 if
 you
 want


them
 to
 go
 up
 or
 down.


It's
 actually
 a
 big
 Ponzi,
 bro.
 To
 be


honest,


it's
 the
 best
 Ponzi
 we
 have,
 but
 it's
 a


Ponzi.


Um,


rare
 earths
 are
 going
 up.
 I
 don't
 see


what
 the
 What
 was
 the
 headline
 that
 just


got
 it
 to
 spike?
 Yeah,
 rare
 earths
 are


going
 up.
 Dude,
 I
 feel
 like
 there's
 a


piece
 of
 news
 we're
 missing
 missing
 that


caused
 that
 spike
 and
 then


caused
 gold
 to
 get
 hit
 as
 bad
 as
 it
 got


hit.
 I
 don't
 see
 it
 though.
 American


Express
 said
 government
 shutdown
 hasn't


hit
 customers
 yet.
 Did
 we
 have
 American


Express
 earnings?
 That's
 a
 big
 one.
 Um,


yeah,
 American
 Express
 beat
 on
 the
 top


and
 the
 bottom.
 Look
 at
 that.
 4%
 beat
 on


EPS,
 2%
 beat
 on
 revenue.
 Revenue
 is
 up


11%
 year-over-year.
 EPS
 is
 up
 19%


year-over-year.


So,
 you
 got
 American
 Express
 putting
 up


good
 numbers.
 Again,
 another
 bank
 that's


out
 there,
 another
 financial
 institution


that's
 not
 really
 showing
 signs
 of


weakness,


but
 the
 regionals
 are
 the
 issue
 that
 we


had
 yesterday.


It's
 also
 a
 Friday,
 dude.
 That's
 the


other
 thing
 we
 got
 to
 remember.
 Fridays,


you
 know,
 sometimes
 get
 low
 volume.
 You


sometimes
 get
 people
 just
 calling
 it


early
 for
 the
 weekend.
 You
 have
 tons
 of


options
 expiring.


So,
 that
 could
 also
 be
 happening.


Micardo
 Libre
 again
 it's
 down
 based
 on


the
 fears
 of
 there's
 a
 couple
 reasons


but
 the
 main
 one
 that
 we
 talked
 about


last
 week
 was
 Amazon
 entering
 Brazil


more
 heavily
 and
 Latin
 America
 I
 just


don't
 know
 enough
 about
 Mart
 liri
 to
 buy


these
 guys
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 it's
 worth


doing
 a
 deep
 dive
 and
 you
 know
 probably


will
 do
 a
 deep
 dive
 eventually
 on
 them


but


they
 don't
 have
 an
 AWS
 they're
 the


Amazon
 of
 Latin
 America
 without
 an
 AWS


now
 they
 have
 a
 payments
 infrastructure


which
 makes
 up
 the
 majority
 of
 their


margin
 because
 that's
 the
 fintech
 part


of
 the
 business
 but
 it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to


buy
 the
 Amazon
 of
 Latin
 America,
 not


fully
 understanding
 the
 dynamics
 of,
 you


know,
 their
 path
 to
 profitability
 or


their
 path
 to
 really
 expand


profitability.
 But
 it's
 a
 high
 quality


company,
 very,
 very
 high
 quality
 company


from
 the
 people
 that
 I
 know
 that
 own


this
 stock.
 And
 I
 think
 in
 five
 years,


if
 you
 buy
 the
 dip
 on
 this,
 you're
 going


to
 be
 okay.


It's
 just
 a
 question
 of
 really


understanding
 what
 you're
 buying.
 Next


decade,
 that's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 9%


getting
 some
 love
 right
 there.


That's
 getting
 some
 green.


So,


that's
 doing
 okay.


Um,


how
 about
 Archer
 and
 Joby?
 What
 about


those
 guys?
 Archer
 1146,
 that's
 down


3.5.
 Joby,
 that's
 also
 down
 1.18.


Yeah,
 Matt
 talked
 about
 Next
 yesterday.


That
 was
 also
 true.
 Did
 you
 see
 Lemonade


integrating
 Tesla
 live
 driving
 data
 into


the
 product?
 I
 did
 not,
 but
 that
 should


be
 bullish
 for
 Lemonade.
 Lemonade
 right


there, they're
 up
 about
 1.4%.
 Lemonade's


also
 been
 stuck.
 It
 was
 at
 60
 a
 couple


weeks
 ago
 and
 then
 it
 was
 down.


Yes,
 Jason
 said
 551
 was
 support
 for
 grab


if
 we
 lose
 551.
 That
 could
 get
 ugly,
 but


maybe
 that's
 where
 we
 bounce
 as
 well.


Pound
 right
 there.
 17644.
 That's
 down


about
 1%
 on
 the
 day.
 BMR
 we
 back
 above


50.
 Nope.
 4950.


4950.
 By
 the
 way,
 Bloomberg,
 we
 don't


have
 US
 initial
 jobless
 claims
 because


the
 government's
 closed,
 but
 Bloomberg


reporting
 based
 on
 looking
 at
 state
 data


that
 jobless
 claims
 fell
 last
 week.
 So,


you're
 getting
 some
 level
 of
 data


based
 on
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 government
 is


shut
 down
 from
 these
 third
 party


sources,
 independent
 sources
 to
 try
 to


figure
 it
 out.
 Dude,
 Kali
 says
 we're
 not


going
 to
 reopen
 till
 November
 16th.
 So,


I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 And
 Trump's
 not


talking
 about
 the
 shutdown
 anymore.
 He's


talking
 about
 China.
 So,


I
 mean,
 we're
 going
 to
 really
 see
 if


this
 thing
 can
 get
 fixed
 in
 the
 next


year
 or
 in
 the
 next
 coming
 weeks.
 Uh,


Barkclays
 raised
 their
 price
 target
 on


Tesla
 to
 350.


So,
 you
 do
 have
 an
 upgrade
 there.
 And


then
 PayPal,


ELF,
 and
 Salesforce
 go
 green.
 PayPal,


ELF,
 and
 Salesforce
 go
 green.


Would
 you
 buy
 hood
 at
 these
 levels?
 For


me,
 no,
 because
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 it.
 for


someone
 DCAing.


I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 a
 nibble.


Nibble
 is
 way
 better
 here
 than
 at
 150.


Now,
 here's
 the
 thing
 about
 Hood
 and
 and


this
 is
 this
 is
 more
 applicable
 to


everything
 high
 beta.
 The
 high
 beta


names
 like
 a
 Nebus,
 for example,
 that


are
 down
 outside
 of
 the
 the
 growth
 story


of
 Nebius
 around
 data
 centers,
 outside


of
 the
 growth
 story
 of
 Robin
 Hood
 on,


you
 know,
 democratizing
 financial


services,
 the
 only
 way
 these
 names
 get


back
 to
 the
 150s
 and
 140s
 of
 the
 world


is
 if
 we
 have
 a
 bull
 market.
 Like,
 I'm


sorry,
 but
 that's
 just
 the
 truth.
 If
 we


don't
 have
 S&P
 7000,
 I
 think
 it's
 going


to
 be
 hard
 for
 Nebulas
 to
 get
 back
 to


140.
 I
 think
 it's
 gonna
 be
 hard
 for
 Hood


to
 get
 back
 to
 150.
 So,
 if
 you're
 buying


Hood
 here
 because
 your
 upside
 is
 150
 by


the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 or
 you
 think
 it
 can


get
 back
 there
 like
 it
 was
 a
 week
 ago,


then
 you
 really
 got
 to
 believe
 we
 end


out
 the
 year
 in
 a
 bull
 market.
 Now,
 if


you're
 buying
 it
 for
 the
 next
 decade,


it's
 whatever,
 right?
 Even
 if
 you
 bought


it
 at
 150
 for
 the
 next
 decade,
 who


cares,
 right?
 If
 you're
 literally
 buying


it
 with
 a
 sort
 of
 10-year
 time
 horizon,


but
 if
 you're
 buying
 it
 strategically
 to


kind
 of
 be
 like,
 "All
 right,
 I'm
 getting


a
 better
 price
 than
 150.
 I
 want
 to
 jump


in
 and
 hopefully
 we
 get
 back
 to
 150.


You've
 got
 to
 believe
 we
 end
 the
 year


out
 S&P
 closer
 to
 7,000,
 right?


Otherwise,
 how
 how
 does
 Bit
 Mine
 get


back
 above
 65
 if
 S&P's,
 you
 know,
 and


Ethereum
 is
 probably
 closer
 to
 5,000
 if


S&P
 gets
 to
 7,000?
 A
 lot
 of
 the
 stuff


moves
 in
 tandem.


And
 so,
 I
 think
 when
 you're
 buying
 the


dip
 on
 a
 high
 beta,
 that's
 why
 I'm


buying
 the
 dip
 more
 on
 grab
 because
 it's


not
 high
 beta.
 And
 if
 I
 have
 to
 hold
 it


for
 the
 next
 five
 years,
 I
 don't
 really


care.
 And
 I
 know
 I'm
 getting
 a
 decent


deal
 based
 on
 my
 understanding
 of
 the


valuation.


you
 know,
 if
 you're
 buying
 Nvidia
 right


here
 to
 get
 back
 to
 195
 and
 we
 don't
 get


S&P7,000,
 it's
 going
 to
 suck
 by
 end
 of


year.
 But
 over
 the
 next
 three
 years,
 I


think
 Nvidia
 is
 probably
 getting
 closer


to
 300
 um
 if
 they
 can
 do
 $11
 VPS
 by


2027.
 So
 180
 is
 not
 that
 bad.
 But
 the


question
 becomes,
 if
 you're
 buying


something
 high
 beta,
 do
 you
 believe


that
 the
 alpha
 to
 the
 market
 will
 return


by
 end
 of
 year?
 I
 ran
 right
 there
 5838.


5838


that
 one
 loses
 60.
 Oscar
 also


losing
 22.
 That's
 down
 about
 5%


as
 well.
 High
 beta
 just
 means
 like
 names


that
 move
 at
 a
 very
 rapid
 speed
 towards


conventional
 names
 like
 Verizon
 is
 not


high
 beta.
 There's
 not
 that
 much


excitement,
 energy
 swings,
 volatility,


etc.
 But
 Palanteer,
 Reddit,
 Robin
 Hood,


all
 these
 other
 cororeweave,
 you
 know,


this
 stuff.
 Cor
 was
 at
 142
 yesterday.


Why?
 because
 they
 uh
 they're
 rumored
 to


be
 in
 some
 data
 center
 deal
 with
 Nvidia


in
 Texas
 and
 a
 new
 AI
 startup
 and
 like


boom
 that
 headline
 will
 take
 it
 up.
 Do


they
 get
 back
 to
 140?
 Sure.
 But
 like


they
 either
 need
 a
 really
 good
 headline


or
 they
 need
 they
 need
 the
 market
 to


reverse.
 They
 need
 the
 VIX
 to
 stop


spiking.
 So
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 these


things
 are
 not
 even
 predicated
 on
 the


companies
 themselves.
 All
 of
 them
 have


really
 good
 like
 fundamental
 stories,


especially
 over
 the
 next
 five
 years.


It's
 over
 the
 next
 five
 months
 do
 those


stories
 get
 back
 to
 normal.
 Yeah,
 Ford


is
 low
 beta.
 Exactly.


Um,


when
 is
 your
 birthday?
 It's
 October


27th.
 Uh,
 Alexo
 says
 on
 21st
 October,


I'm
 celebrating
 one
 year
 since
 I
 started


investing.
 Wow,
 I
 love
 it.
 It's
 4
 days


investing
 anniversary.


I
 think
 I
 legit
 legit
 started
 investing


closer
 to
 2019.


didn't
 get
 into
 it
 as
 much
 like
 at
 20


2019
 I
 started
 like
 looking
 at
 stocks


and
 caring
 about
 the
 market.
 2020


obviously
 because
 of
 covid
 everyone
 you


know
 had
 more
 time
 to
 care


but
 yeah
 one
 year
 investing
 anniversary


definitely
 is
 something
 that
 is
 special


and
 it
 matters
 right
 being
 an
 investor


going
 through
 the
 emotional
 swings
 we
 go


through
 every
 day
 it
 is
 not
 for
 the


faint
 of
 heart
 like
 like
 to
 to
 be
 able


to
 deal
 with
 this
 [ __ ]
 every
 day
 and
 to


willingfully
 put
 ourselves
 through
 the


euphoria
 and
 the
 misery
 at
 the
 same
 time


by
 the
 way
 all
 of
 us
 are
 still
 pretty


much
 up
 for
 the
 year
 bro
 I


It's
 not
 like,
 you
 know,
 we're
 we're


losing
 money
 this
 year.
 S&P
 is
 still
 up


10%.
 Most
 of
 us
 have
 beat
 the
 S&P.
 So,


it's
 like
 it's
 not
 up
 as
 as
 much
 as
 it


was
 last
 week,
 but
 it's
 nothing
 to
 cry


about.
 It's
 just
 annoying
 because
 all


these
 digits


go
 down
 on
 the
 screen.
 But


it's
 important.
 It's
 important
 to
 even


be
 happy
 that
 you're
 in
 the
 game
 in
 the


first
 place.
 And
 you're
 coping.
 Yes,
 I


am
 coping.
 I'm
 Exactly.
 Yes,
 I
 am
 100%


coping.
 Um,
 let's
 look
 at
 the
 heat
 map.


What
 do
 we
 got?
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to


get
 a
 red
 heat
 map.


I
 think
 we'll
 get
 a
 pretty
 red
 heat
 map.


Let's
 see.


Um,


we
 are


relatively
 red.
 Gray
 is
 more
 like


nothing
 changed.
 Gray
 is
 like
 flat,
 down


half
 a
 percent.
 You
 have
 some
 pockets
 of


green
 in
 financials.


Palladium
 goes
 down
 7%.
 Silver,
 by
 the


way,
 is
 down
 4%.


Uh,
 and
 gold
 goes
 down
 about
 two
 and
 a


half
 percent
 as
 well.


Why
 is
 the
 W
 VIX
 falling
 while
 the


market's
 going
 wild?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean,


that's
 an
 interesting
 question,
 but
 the


VIX
 coming
 down
 doesn't
 necessarily
 mean


the
 market
 has
 to
 go
 up.


the
 VIX
 has
 to
 come
 down
 dramatically


for
 the
 market
 to
 kind
 of,
 you
 know,
 get


that
 top
 in
 the
 the
 short-term
 top
 in


the
 VIX
 and
 then
 spike,
 which
 would


signal
 a
 bottom
 in
 the
 equity
 market.


But
 if
 the
 VIX
 like
 falls
 a
 couple


percentage
 points,
 it's
 not
 like
 an


immediate
 market
 goes
 higher.


VIX
 is
 still
 24.
 I
 mean,
 that
 dude,
 the


VIX
 was
 under
 20
 for
 like
 five
 months.


So,
 the
 fact
 that
 we've
 been
 living
 with


the
 VIX
 above
 22,
 23
 for
 the
 past
 couple


of
 days
 is
 is
 why
 you're
 seeing
 all
 this


volatility.
 Yeah.
 Yeah,
 VIX
 under
 20


would
 be
 when
 we're
 we're
 calming
 down
 a


bit
 more.


Um,


regional
 banks
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an


upgrade.
 Well,
 let's
 see.
 KRE,
 this


thing
 was
 wrecked
 yesterday.
 This
 is
 the


ETF
 for
 regional
 banks.
 This
 is
 Wow,


it's
 actually
 up.
 Okay,
 so
 little


recovery,
 which
 is
 not
 horrible.
 And


you're
 getting
 some
 green.
 By
 the
 way,


the
 uh
 in
 the
 pre-market,
 the
 European


regional
 bank
 index


was
 hit
 3%.
 That
 one
 might
 have


recovered


since
 since
 then.


Um


uh
 a
 little
 bit,
 but
 you
 did
 get
 a
 bit


of a
 hit
 in
 European
 regional
 banks
 as


well
 from
 the
 United
 States,
 which
 is


kind
 of
 stupid,
 bro.


one
 bank
 in
 the
 United
 States
 saying
 we


have
 some
 issues
 which
 is
 a
 $50
 million


issue
 by
 the
 way
 that
 wiped
 out
 a


billion
 in
 market
 cap
 that's
 affecting


all
 the
 European
 regional
 banks.
 Like


that's
 just
 weird.
 It
 goes
 to
 show
 how


fragile
 this
 market
 is
 on
 narratives.


And
 it
 also
 goes
 to
 show
 how
 excited
 the


market
 be
 can
 be
 on
 narratives.
 I
 mean


OpenAI
 and
 AMD
 announced
 something.


Boom.
 AMD
 is
 up
 40%.
 Like
 that's
 not


normal
 in
 any
 market.
 But
 it's
 also
 not


normal
 for
 one
 bank
 to
 say
 we
 had
 a
 bad


earnings
 even
 though
 every
 other
 bank


said
 we've
 had
 a
 phenomenal
 earnings
 and


then
 the
 markets
 crash.
 I
 mean
 it's
 it


it's
 the
 volatility
 that
 goes
 with
 you


up
 or
 down


across
 the
 board.
 Let's
 look
 at
 the


stock
 draft
 and
 see
 what
 we've
 got


there.
 Um


let's
 see.
 Let's
 see.
 Let's
 see.


So
 Matt's
 at
 45%


still.
 I'm
 at
 36.


Matt
 Rock
 11
 really
 helping.
 So
 just


went
 green.
 Tanner's
 at
 19.
 Steve's
 at


six.
 Chris
 is
 at
 10.


The
 only
 way
 I
 have
 a
 chance
 of
 beating


Matt
 is
 if
 Duolingo
 fully
 recovers
 or
 if


Matt
 loses
 some
 momentum
 on
 Rocket
 Lab


and
 AS.


If
 not,
 Matt's
 going
 to
 win
 this


probably
 for
 a
 while.
 But
 we
 still
 have,


you
 know,
 another
 eight
 months
 to
 see


how
 this
 plays
 out.
 S&P
 just
 went
 green


again.
 Dude,
 this
 is
 like
 seven


different
 green
 versus
 red
 switches
 on


the
 market.
 AMD
 might
 lose
 230
 right


here.
 Oh,
 it
 did
 lose
 230
 at
 228.
 Back


to
 230.


It's
 weird,
 bro.


Back
 and
 forth,
 up
 and
 down,


back
 and
 forth,
 up


and
 down.
 I
 got
 grabbed
 at
 5:49


overnight.
 Wow,
 that's
 incredible.
 You


got
 it
 at
 5:49.


Uh
 Trump
 was
 live
 yesterday
 as
 well.


He's
 I
 mean
 he
 didn't
 talk
 too
 much


about
 the
 broader
 market.
 However,
 he


did


uh
 well
 he
 did
 say
 something
 that
 pissed


off
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 and
 this
 is
 what
 he


said.


>> It's
 such
 a
 big
 category
 everything


follows.
 So
 just
 about
 everything


follows
 and
 we
 are
 working
 on
 beef
 and
 I


think
 we
 have
 a
 deal
 on
 beef
 that's


going
 to
 bring
 the
 price
 of
 beef.
 would


be
 the
 one
 one
 product
 that
 we
 would
 say


is
 a
 little
 bit
 higher
 than
 we
 want
 it,


maybe
 higher
 than
 we
 want
 it.
 And
 that's


going
 to
 be
 coming
 down
 pretty
 soon,


too.
 We
 did
 something.
 We
 worked
 our


magic,
 but
 groceries
 are
 down
 and
 energy


is
 down.
 Electricity
 is
 way
 down.
 Uh
 we


have
 the
 prices
 coming
 down
 for
 people.


They
 were
 they
 were
 abused
 for
 four


years
 by
 the
 Biden
 administration.
 Uh


thank
 you
 very
 much
 everybody.


>> The
 the
 beef
 stuff
 didn't
 really
 piss


people
 off.
 What
 pissed
 people
 off
 was


him
 saying
 groceries
 are
 down,


electricity
 is
 down,
 prices
 are
 down.
 If


you
 looked
 at
 some
 of
 the
 comments


underneath
 that
 video,
 people
 were
 like,


"Uh,
 no,


stocks
 way
 down."


They
 uh
 no,
 electricity
 is
 not
 down.


Groceries
 are
 not
 down.
 Prices
 are
 not


necessarily
 coming
 down.
 Now,
 to
 an


extent,
 he's
 right
 about
 that.
 I
 mean,


eggs
 are
 back
 down
 to
 the
 lowest
 price


they
 were
 since
 May
 of
 2023.
 But
 as
 an


aggregate,


even
 if
 statistically
 he
 may
 be
 correct,


you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 just


anecdotally
 are
 like
 that's
 not
 that's


not
 the
 case.


But
 stocks
 are
 still
 up
 for
 the
 year,


which
 goes
 to
 that
 bifurcation
 of
 the


economy,
 right?
 Do
 you
 own
 assets
 or
 do


you
 not
 own
 assets?
 Because
 if
 you
 own


assets,
 you
 might
 not
 care
 that
 much


that
 you
 know
 grocery
 prices
 are
 not


down
 as
 much
 as
 they
 need
 to
 be.
 If
 you


don't
 own
 assets,
 you
 you
 know
 that's


really
 upsetting.
 And
 so
 it's
 like
 it's


a
 tale
 of
 two
 economies.
 S&P
 actually


making
 a
 move
 right
 here.
 Let's
 see
 if


this
 one
 has
 any
 juice
 to
 it.
 If
 we
 can


break
 662.
 Look
 at
 that
 green.


Maybe
 65820
 was
 that
 bottom.


I
 tried
 not
 to
 own
 assets.
 Just
 beef
 and


soybeans.
 Exactly.
 Just
 beef
 and


soybeans.
 Oh,
 are
 we
 going?
 Oh,
 yeah.
 We


hit
 662.


Okay,
 let's
 see
 if
 there's
 any
 juice


that
 we
 can
 squeeze
 out.
 That
 pounder


180
 Tesla
 432.


She's
 trying.


She's
 trying
 to
 get
 there.
 If
 she
 goes


right
 back
 down,
 then
 today
 is
 just
 an


up
 and
 down
 day.
 There's
 no
 trend
 that


we
 can
 get
 here.
 Now,
 has
 that
 going


green
 as
 well?


That
 is
 also
 true.


Um,


let
 me
 see
 what
 other
 headlines
 do
 we


have.
 What
 else
 do
 we
 have?
 That
 is
 not


Pal
 standing
 behind
 Trump.
 That
 is
 Dr.


Oz.
 My
 mom
 texted
 me
 the
 other
 day,
 too.


She's
 like,
 "My
 mom
 used
 to
 watch
 Dr.
 Oz


like
 10
 years
 ago."
 She's
 like, "Why
 is


Dr.
 Oz
 in
 the
 Oval
 Office?"
 I
 was
 like,


"He's
 part
 of
 the
 administration."
 She's


like,
 "Okay,
 I
 guess."
 There
 you
 go.
 S&P


66220.


Robin
 Hood
 breaks
 130.
 Across
 the
 board,


you're
 seeing
 some
 green
 candles.
 Meta


goes
 green.
 Salesforce
 goes
 green.


PayPal
 goes
 green.
 Roblox,
 Uber,
 Pounder


Hood,
 Rocket
 Lab
 6760,


Nvidia
 back
 to
 182.


Okay,
 the
 buyers
 are
 stepping
 in.


Oh,
 here
 we
 go.
 So,
 this
 is
 this
 might


be
 the
 headline.
 US
 jobless
 claims
 fell


to
 around
 215,000
 last
 week,
 even
 as
 the


government
 shutdown
 delays
 official


reports.
 Uh
 Bloomberg
 and
 Goldman
 Sachs


data
 show
 a
 steady
 labor
 market
 with


continuing
 claims
 nearing
 1.9
 million.


That
 might
 be
 the
 headline
 to
 be
 honest.


It
 let
 might
 literally
 be
 Bloomberg


saying
 jobless
 claims
 are
 way
 lower
 than


expected.
 I
 mean,
 usually
 it
 averages


like
 230
 235.


215
 is
 actually
 pretty
 good
 to
 be


honest,
 given,
 you
 know,
 people
 are


concerned
 about
 the
 labor
 market,


but
 it
 might
 not
 be
 enough.
 It
 might
 not


be
 enough
 to
 keep
 us
 green.
 Oaklow
 just


went
 green.
 All right,
 so
 maybe
 some


risk
 ons
 coming
 back
 to
 the
 market.


There
 you
 go.


Oaklow
 was
 up.


A
 what's
 your
 time
 frame
 on
 AMKR?
 I'm


holding
 for
 at least
 a
 year.
 I
 think
 it


gets
 rerated
 closer
 to
 50.
 And
 yeah,
 it


didn't
 react
 to
 much
 of
 the
 chaos


because
 again,
 it's
 it
 doesn't
 have
 that


much
 of
 a
 multiple
 in
 the
 first
 place.


So,
 the
 risk
 in
 buying
 something
 like
 an


Amcore
 is
 that
 the
 multiple
 doesn't


expand.
 The
 the
 the
 safety
 in
 buying


something
 like
 an
 Amcore
 is
 that
 when


stocks
 go
 down,
 this
 thing
 will
 go
 down,


but
 it's
 not
 I
 mean,
 it's
 down
 12
 cents


today.
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 go
 down
 as
 much


as
 a
 Robin
 Hood
 that
 has
 a
 lot
 more
 beta


baked
 into
 it
 and
 a
 lot
 more
 multiple


baked
 into
 it.
 So,
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 sweet


spot.
 If
 you're
 right
 on
 the
 name,
 if


you're
 right
 on
 the
 thesis,
 you
 should


get
 decent
 upside.
 You
 know,
 I'm


thinking
 closing
 in
 on
 45
 50%
 upside.
 If


you're
 if
 you're
 wrong
 on
 the
 name,
 you


shouldn't
 have
 that
 much
 downside
 unless


the
 company
 really
 messes
 up,
 which,
 you


know,
 theoretically
 you
 should
 do
 enough


due
 diligence
 to
 to
 hopefully
 try
 to


mitigate
 against
 that.
 And
 so
 that's
 why


I
 like
 the
 the
 valuation
 of
 Amcore
 Robin


right
 there.
 130.3


that's
 breaking
 130
 yen
 so
 far
 trying
 to


finally
 get
 to
 27.
 Is
 hims
 tanking?


Wow.
 8%
 down
 on
 him.


is
 that
 so
 so
 Trump
 it
 might
 be
 a
 a


reflection
 of
 the
 comments
 Trump
 made


yesterday
 about
 uh
 well
 Trump
 basically


was
 like
 we're
 gonna
 try
 to
 get
 the


the
 fatshot
 drug
 to
 come
 down
 in
 prices


and
 uh
 I
 mean
 all
 Eli
 Liy
 got
 hit
 all


those
 stocks
 got
 hit
 like
 that
 so
 I


guess
 hims
 to
 an
 extent
 is
 affected
 as


well


but
 that's
 that's
 a
 pretty
 nasty
 8%


decline
 we'll
 see
 if
 that
 reverses


you're
 getting
 A
 little
 53
 to
 54.
 A


little
 reversal
 right
 there.
 S&P
 661.


Hims
 is
 dead
 with
 the
 CEO.
 Like
 that,


dude.
 Like,
 no.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 I
 know
 I


I
 talked
 about
 the
 CEO
 this
 morning,
 but


Hims
 is
 not
 dead
 just
 because
 the
 CEO


had
 that
 eye
 emoji
 and
 then
 he
 sold


shares.
 Like,
 is
 it
 cringe?
 Yes,
 100%.


Is
 is
 Hims
 dead?
 No,
 of
 course
 not,
 bro.


at
 the
 end
 like
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 if


you're
 a
 him
 shareholder
 you
 care
 about


the
 business
 not
 what
 the
 CEO
 is
 doing


in
 in
 that
 respect
 like
 that
 now
 it


probably
 turns
 off
 a
 lot
 of
 the


shareholders
 but
 by
 no
 means
 is
 it
 dead


right
 every
 CEO
 has
 their
 own
 quirks
 I


just
 didn't
 expect
 the
 him
 CEO
 to
 also


he
 did
 this
 before
 this
 is
 not
 his
 first


time
 quoting
 someone
 or
 responding
 to


someone
 talking
 about
 the
 stock
 you
 know


so
 that
 that's
 another
 reason
 I
 think


it's
 rubbing
 people
 the
 wrong
 way
 but


it's
 not
 endemic
 of
 a
 structural


problems
 inside
 of
 the
 company
 now
 Bank


of
 America
 saying
 their
 Q3
 is
 going
 to


suck.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 give
 a
 bare
 case,


Bank
 of
 America
 is
 saying,
 "We're


looking
 at
 credit
 card
 orders.
 We're


looking
 at
 their
 average
 order
 per


customer.
 We
 don't
 think
 Q3
 is
 going to


be
 a
 good
 quarter."
 That
 could
 be
 a


better
 bare
 case,


but
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 because
 of
 the
 uh


the
 CEO
 itself.


I
 still
 have
 half
 my
 HIMS.
 I
 sold
 half


at
 62


and
 I
 still
 have
 the
 other
 half.
 S&P


right
 there
 661,


losing
 662.
 Just
 like
 that
 again.


losing
 66
 662


down
 red
 on
 the
 day
 or
 not
 red
 but
 close


to
 going
 red


rather
 by
 Oscar.


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 Oscar
 is
 not
 as
 much
 of
 a


growth
 play
 as
 him
 and
 Oscar
 has
 some


more
 regulatory
 issues
 but
 then
 again
 I


can't
 say
 Oscar
 has
 regulatory
 issues


because
 him
 every
 time
 Novo
 issues
 a


patent
 or
 lawsuit
 or
 something
 happens


with
 compounders.


I
 did
 not
 know
 when
 I
 bought
 HIMS
 when


most
 of
 you
 guys
 were
 like,
 you
 know,


when
 HIMS
 was
 at
 the
 height
 of
 its
 mania


back
 in
 June
 and
 like
 every
 day
 in
 this


chat
 it
 would
 just
 be
 Hims
 him.
 You


guys,
 you
 know,
 really
 got
 me
 to
 look
 at


it.
 I
 did
 not
 know
 the
 amount
 of
 legal


[ __ ]
 this
 company
 has
 to
 deal
 with
 and
 I


should
 have.
 And
 this
 is
 why
 you
 don't


buy
 stuff
 unless
 you
 really
 actually
 do


some
 work
 on
 it.
 Like
 I
 just
 I
 didn't


realize
 that
 like
 they're
 not
 only
 in
 a


highly
 regulated
 industry,
 they're
 in
 a


regulated
 industry
 where
 all
 the
 other


big
 pharma
 companies
 hate
 what
 they're


doing
 with
 the
 compounders.


And
 if
 you
 want
 to,
 you
 know,
 go
 on
 the


ride
 for
 the
 next
 10
 years
 of
 thinking


him
 is
 going to
 take
 on
 big
 pharma,
 be


my
 guest.
 But
 like,
 I
 kind
 of
 don't
 want


to
 be
 on
 that
 ride.
 I
 don't
 care
 enough


about
 that
 ride.
 Like
 there's
 plenty
 of


other
 rides
 that
 I
 would
 like
 to
 go
 on


versus
 that
 type
 of
 ride.
 And
 if
 I
 just


really
 understood
 that,
 I
 would
 have


never
 bought
 in.
 I'm
 sorry.
 I
 just
 like


not
 to
 be
 bearish
 on
 the
 company.
 just


like
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 deal
 with
 that.


And
 it
 goes
 to
 show
 how
 much
 it's


important
 to
 just
 do
 some
 due
 diligence.


Weeble
 right
 here
 1139.


That's
 down
 about
 3%.
 Thoughts
 on


Cororee
 here?
 Look,
 I
 like
 Cororee.
 Jose


likes
 Cororee,
 but
 I
 I'm
 not
 sleeping


well
 at
 night
 buying
 Cororeef.
 I'm
 I'd


rather
 buy
 more
 Nvidia
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 bad
 to
 buy


Cororeweave
 here.
 I
 But
 but
 I
 I
 I
 know


that
 if
 Nvidia
 gives
 me
 a
 dip,
 like
 I


can
 buy
 it
 sustainably
 and
 hold
 on
 to


it.
 Cororeweave,
 you
 know,
 they
 lose
 a


contract,
 this
 happens,
 that
 happens.


You
 just
 never
 know.
 The
 funny
 thing


about
 this
 AI
 sector,
 though,
 and
 this


is what
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 with
 Steve


yesterday,
 is
 like
 Cororeweave,
 Nebius,


all
 these
 companies
 have
 to
 they
 should


be
 programmed
 to
 go
 higher
 in
 value
 over


the
 next
 5
 years.
 If
 you
 think
 Nvidia


goes
 to
 10
 trillion,
 so
 when
 you
 say,


what
 do
 you
 think
 about
 Cororeweave?
 I'm


like,
 well,
 I
 don't
 like
 it.
 I'd
 rather


buy
 Nvidia,
 but
 if
 Nvidia
 goes
 to
 10


trillion,
 Coree
 is
 definitely
 not
 going


to
 be
 just
 a
 67
 billion
 company.
 Like,


it
 it
 will
 have
 to
 go
 high.
 Like
 there's


no
 way
 that
 entire
 ecosystem,
 Broadcom,


Micron,
 SMCI,
 all
 those
 guys
 don't
 get
 a


bid.


So
 the
 real
 question
 is,
 you
 know,
 which


one
 out
 of
 all
 of
 them
 do
 you
 like?
 But


I
 don't
 think
 the
 question
 is,
 you
 know,


will
 you
 get
 screwed
 on
 one
 of
 them?


Because
 over
 the
 next
 five
 years,
 if
 you


think
 Nvidia
 is
 10
 trillion,
 they
 I


think
 they
 all
 have
 to
 probably
 go
 up.


But
 I'd
 rather
 just
 buy
 more
 Nvidia.


Uh
 VIX
 is
 going
 back
 up.
 S&P
 going
 back


down.
 Dude,
 we
 haven't
 had
 a
 Friday
 like


this
 in
 a
 while
 where
 it's
 literally
 a


roller
 coaster
 for
 the
 first
 30
 minutes.


Usually,
 we
 get
 a
 trend
 and
 we
 kind
 of


stay
 flat
 in
 that
 trend
 and
 see
 what


happens.


This
 is
 up,
 down,
 up,
 down,
 up,
 down


across
 the
 board.


Um,


Nebius,
 what
 do
 we
 have
 on
 Nebius
 right


here?
 117,
 still
 down
 four.
 TSM
 had
 a


great
 earnings
 yesterday.
 TSM,


that's
 green.
 At least
 that's
 holding


on.


And
 silver
 is
 still
 getting
 hit.
 All


right,
 we
 got
 some
 we
 got
 some
 data
 on


the
 jobs.
 Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up.
 See
 if
 we


can
 get
 some
 coverage
 on
 that.


Tenure
 back
 about
 4%.
 Okay,
 that's
 not


the
 best
 either.
 Let's
 pull
 up
 some
 of


this
 job
 data.
 Yeah,
 tenure
 is
 back


above
 4%
 right
 here.
 blackout
 period


next
 week
 ahead
 of
 its
 ear
 ahead
 of
 its


meeting
 the
 week
 after.
 So
 maybe
 here


are
 some
 of
 the
 other
 sources
 they're


looking
 at
 to
 tell
 us
 what's
 happening


on
 jobs
 or
 at
 least
 investors
 are


looking
 at
 the
 Indeed
 data.
 Indeed
 is


the
 job
 posting
 site.
 Okay,


>> so
 it
 turns
 out
 there
 is
 so


uh
 the
 what
 we're
 looking
 at
 here
 in
 the


Indeed
 data
 is
 interest
 in
 holiday
 jobs


and
 that
 is
 trending
 higher.
 If
 you
 look


at
 this
 year,
 the
 purple
 line
 2025,
 what


does
 that
 tell
 us?
 More
 people.


>> Okay,
 there
 it
 is.


>> There
 it
 is.
 See,
 as
 you
 can
 see,
 you


know,
 there's
 always
 interest
 in


>> holiday
 jobs
 around
 this
 going
 into
 the


holiday
 season,
 right?
 Temporary
 work


and
 then
 usually
 that
 tails
 off.
 That's


normal,
 right?
 seasonality
 thing.
 But


what
 the
 purple
 line
 is
 showing
 is
 that


there's
 more
 interest
 this
 year


>> in
 holiday
 jobs.
 People
 looking
 that


that
 temporary
 work.


>> Is
 that
 good
 or
 bad?


>> Well,
 it's
 a
 bad
 sign
 for
 the
 labor


market,
 right?
 Because
 it's
 more
 people


wanting
 to
 either
 pick
 up
 more
 jobs,


work
 temporarily.
 I
 mean,
 when
 when


they're
 out
 looking
 for
 jobs,
 it
 means


they
 don't
 have
 jobs
 and
 they're
 looking


for
 other
 sources
 of
 income.
 So,
 that
 is


something
 we're
 watching.
 You
 know,
 we


we've
 reported
 a
 lot
 on
 the
 slowdown
 in


the
 jobs
 market.
 We
 have
 no
 idea
 what


the
 September
 report
 looks
 like.
 Um
 but


that
 that's
 that's
 potentially
 a
 sign
 of


>> what
 else
 you
 got
 in
 your
 alternative


data
 sources
 here?


>> This
 is
 very
 old.
 So
 this
 is
 the
 this
 is


the
 Google
 search.
 This
 is
 from
 Nick


Kolas.
 Okay.
 Um
 and
 uh
 data
 track.
 And


here
 he's
 looking
 at
 Google
 search


numbers
 um
 of
 new
 finding
 a
 job
 and
 new


job.
 And
 what
 he
 found
 there
 is
 actually


they
 hit
 20-year
 highs
 those
 Google


searches
 which
 tells
 us
 something
 about


what
 people
 are
 googling
 right
 now
 which


is
 how
 to
 find
 a
 job
 and
 getting
 a
 new


job.
 um
 we
 have
 not
 seen
 jobless
 claims


tick
 higher
 that
 is
 people
 filing
 for


unemployment
 claims
 which
 would
 signal


layoffs
 but
 we
 have
 not
 received
 the


data
 in
 recent
 weeks.
 So


>> I
 mean
 that
 again
 we're
 left
 with
 and


you
 are
 I
 frankly
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 deal


with
 this
 stuff
 but
 it's
 it's
 key
 for


you


>> like
 you
 search
 it
 you
 could
 also
 argue


a
 really
 good
 jobs
 market
 where
 people


think
 there
 are
 other
 opportunities
 is
 a


reason
 to
 put
 in
 hey
 I'm
 looking
 for
 a


different
 job
 or
 a
 new
 job
 right
 we
 we


haven't
 typically
 seen
 that
 during
 you


know
 if
 you
 look
 at
 some
 of
 the
 Google


searches
 that
 you
 don't
 usually
 see
 big


searches
 for
 new
 jobs
 but
 agree
 like
 job


switchers
 happen
 sometimes
 when
 wage


growth
 is
 a
 little
 higher
 that
 sure


could
 be
 the
 case
 but
 we
 haven't
 seen


the
 switchers
 wage
 growth
 numbers
 move


higher.
 They've
 sort
 of
 been
 lower
 in


the
 ADP
 report
 for
 instance.
 But
 yeah,


we
 we we
 really
 don't
 fly.
 Exactly.


We're
 flying
 by
 the
 data.


>> You
 got
 a
 feel
 for
 me
 on
 this?


>> Well,
 the
 feel
 is
 that,
 you
 know,
 we're


sort
 of
 in
 a
 low
 job
 growth
 economy.
 We


haven't


>> The
 feel
 is
 the
 same,
 I
 think,
 based
 on


what
 Jay
 Pal
 said,
 which
 is
 low
 hire,


low
 fire.


if
 this
 third
 party
 data
 is
 accurate


about
 um
 jobless
 claims,
 which
 is
 good,


but


you
 know,
 I
 think
 the
 market's
 more


concerned
 with
 China
 and
 everything
 else


that's
 going
 on
 right
 now.
 Again,
 back


to
 green
 on
 the
 S&P.


This
 has
 been
 a
 wild
 day
 of
 swings
 back


and
 forth.
 Tesla
 is
 holding
 on
 to
 a


little
 1%.


Nvidia
 18220.


18220.


Grab
 still
 holding
 550.
 It
 did
 get
 to


565.
 Google
 251.


I
 mean,
 it
 literally
 looks
 like
 it's


just
 going
 to
 go
 up
 and
 down,
 up
 and


down.


Yeah.
 What
 did
 you
 guys
 say
 on
 the
 poll?


51%
 of
 you
 said
 red.


Okay,
 so
 5050,
 but
 the
 majority
 still


said
 red.


Intel's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 all
 I
 can
 say
 is
 it


is
 way
 better.
 Intel
 up
 2.5.
 It
 is
 way


better
 than
 freaking
 2
 2
 a.m.
 2
 am
 was


disgusting,
 bro.


2
 AM
 was
 so
 bad
 and
 like
 no
 one
 had
 a


reason
 for
 why,
 but
 it
 feels
 like
 I'll


take
 this
 any
 day
 of
 the
 week.
 I
 I'll


take
 this
 to
 end
 out
 the
 month.
 If
 the


month,
 if
 the
 rest
 of
 October
 ends
 like


this,
 I'll
 take
 that
 over
 what
 we
 saw
 at


2
 am.


2
 am
 was
 ugly.
 Silver
 4%
 decline.
 Look


at
 that.
 51.87.
 Is
 the
 silver


momentum
 finally
 slowing
 down?


Is
 that
 happening?


I
 mean,
 dude,
 commodities
 have
 had
 a


crazy
 run.
 silver,
 copper,


freaking
 gold.


Like,


I
 don't
 know.
 Them
 taking
 a
 breather


would
 not
 be
 crazy.


It's
 just
 it's
 just
 one
 of
 those
 things,


right?
 Which
 is
 like,
 all
 right,
 if
 you


think
 we're
 straight
 up
 bull
 market,


then
 you
 got
 to
 go
 through
 some
 of
 these


days,
 some
 of
 this
 volatility
 to
 get


there
 at
 the
 end,
 which
 would
 be,
 you


know,
 whatever
 target
 you
 have
 on
 on


what
 this
 bull
 market
 ends
 up
 being.


But
 it's
 also
 like
 it
 a
 lot
 of
 this


stuff
 doesn't
 make
 sense.
 Gold
 goes
 to


the
 moon,
 Treasury
 yields
 come
 down,


stocks
 go
 up
 like
 crazy,
 then
 go
 down


based
 on
 a
 tweet,
 then
 go
 up
 based
 on
 a


tweet.
 And
 I
 know
 that's
 been
 the
 story


of
 the
 whole
 year,
 but
 like
 that
 at
 this


stage
 of
 the
 year
 after
 two
 great


months,
 August,
 September,
 where
 we


should
 have
 had
 some
 dips,
 like
 it's


just
 a
 lot
 of
 wonky
 stuff
 that
 has


happened.
 And
 then
 you
 got
 a
 government


shutdown,
 so
 no
 one
 really
 knows
 the


data
 on
 what's
 going
 on.


I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 hard
 to
 definitively


make
 a
 bare
 case
 or
 a
 bull
 case
 here.


Then
 you
 got
 this
 meme
 stock
 nonsense.


That
 meme
 stock
 ETF
 down
 another
 2.8%


right
 there.


Palinger
 17951,
 S&P
 still

 as
 well.


Tanner
 says,
 "Slept
 in.
 What
 did
 I


miss?"


Bro,
 this
 guy.
 Do
 you
 wake
 up
 every
 day


at
 10
 am,
 Tanner?
 Do
 you
 just
 wake
 up


and
 ignore
 all
 of
 the
 all
 of
 the


freaking


all
 of
 the
 freaking
 pre-market


volatility?


It's
 actually
 pretty
 good
 for
 your


mental
 health,
 to
 be
 honest.


Even
 Nate,
 Nate
 was
 up
 at
 freaking
 4


a.m.
 and
 he
 saw
 Nebius
 and
 Nebus
 was
 at


1:11.
 He's
 like, "Bro,
 who
 the
 hell
 is


selling
 Nebius
 at
 4:00
 a.m.?
 What's


going
 on?"
 Like
 what
 is
 happening
 here?


This
 thing
 was
 at
 140
 four
 days
 ago.


Tom
 Lee
 just
 tweeted.
 Oh
 boy.
 What
 did


Tom
 Lee
 say?


What
 did
 Tom
 Lee
 say?


He
 said
 buy
 the
 dip.


That's
 one
 of
 the
 most
 surprising
 things


in
 the
 world
 to
 be
 honest.
 He
 said
 I


understand
 why
 markets
 are
 wary.
 China


US
 tensions,
 major
 deleveraging
 last


week,
 cockroach
 fears
 on
 private
 credit.


October
 is
 the
 month
 we
 tend
 to
 see,
 but


sentiment
 is
 negative,
 which
 is
 good
 to


be
 contrarian.
 Only
 22%
 of
 fund
 managers


are
 beating
 their
 benchmark,
 aka
 they're


going
 to
 chase.
 We
 talked
 about
 the
 stat


for
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 now.
 That
 that


could
 create
 a
 chase.


Buy
 the
 effing
 dip
 is
 our
 take.


All right,
 Mr.
 Tom
 Lee,
 that's
 his


argument.


That
 is
 his
 argument.


Buy
 the
 dip.


I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 I
 I
 can't
 say
 I
 dis
 I


don't
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 disagree.


Like,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 and
 we've


talked
 about
 this
 for
 the
 past
 week
 now,


like,
 is
 there
 something
 structural
 that


has
 changed
 in
 the
 economy?
 Not
 really.


Is
 this
 China
 thing
 a
 big
 deal?
 Not


really.
 Is
 regional
 banks
 the
 the
 the


uh,
 you
 know,
 big
 crisis
 that
 the
 market


was
 looking
 for
 based
 on
 everything
 we


looked
 at
 over
 the
 past
 24
 hours?
 Not


really.
 Based
 on
 the
 regional
 banks
 that


reported
 this
 morning?
 Not
 really.
 Have


earnings
 been
 phenomenal?
 Yes.
 So,


what's
 the
 issue?
 I
 think
 the
 issue
 is


the
 markets
 got
 exhausted.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 what
 Tom
 Lee's
 basically
 saying


is
 like
 look,
 the
 markets
 are
 looking


for
 whatever
 reason
 they
 can,
 whether


it's
 China,
 US
 or
 soybeans
 or
 whatever


to
 like
 go
 down,
 but
 that's
 not
 an


actual
 structural
 change


in
 the
 underlying
 economy.


The
 only
 structural
 argument
 you
 can


make
 is
 credit.
 And
 and
 again,
 one


regional
 bank
 saying
 there's
 a
 credit


issue,
 and
 they
 didn't
 even
 say
 there's


a
 credit
 issue.
 they
 just
 had
 a
 50


million
 charge
 off
 that
 that
 that
 can't


be
 the
 structural
 reason.


So
 then
 what
 is
 the
 actual
 reason,


right?
 Like
 even
 put
 in
 the
 chat,
 what


is
 the
 structural
 reason
 why
 you


shouldn't
 buy
 the
 dip?
 I'm
 not
 saying


people
 should
 buy
 the
 dip
 today.
 I'm


just
 saying
 like
 if
 you
 were
 to
 deploy


capital
 at
 prices
 that
 are
 way
 better


than
 what
 you
 could
 get
 two
 weeks
 ago,


outside
 of
 just
 purely
 wanting
 to
 stay


in
 cash,
 what
 is
 the
 structural
 reason


you
 wouldn't
 do
 so?


I
 can't
 think
 of
 a
 major
 reason.
 AMD


with
 a
 green
 candle
 right
 there
 at
 234.


I
 don't
 think
 Venezuela
 is
 the
 reason,


bro.
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 would
 be
 it.


Um,


can
 you
 just
 discuss
 Sam's
 point
 of
 not


wanting
 to
 buy
 the
 dip?
 You
 guys
 got
 to


remember
 Sam
 is
 more
 of
 a
 risk
 averse


type
 of
 investor
 and
 he's
 been
 very


public
 about
 this.
 Like
 Sam
 hedges
 all


the
 time.
 Sam
 is
 not
 the
 type
 of
 guy
 to


just
 go
 crazy
 buying
 the
 dip.
 Uh
 Sam,
 I


think
 sold
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 stocks


the
 other
 day
 and
 like
 took
 some


profits.
 Sam
 also
 has
 a
 wife
 and
 two
 two


young
 kids.
 You
 know,
 he
 just
 just
 did
 a


Disney
 World
 vacation.
 Everyone's
 uh
 you


know,
 financial
 situation
 is
 different.


And
 you
 know,
 I
 don't
 know
 his
 portfolio


size,
 but
 he
 might
 have
 a
 portfolio
 to


the
 point
 where
 he
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 he


needs
 to
 get
 more
 allocated
 into
 into


the
 market.
 So,
 I
 wouldn't
 use
 one


perspective
 as
 a
 reason
 to
 make
 it
 an


underlying
 perspective.
 It's
 more
 so
 him


just,
 you
 know,
 he's
 very
 quick
 to
 sell


a
 covered
 call
 or
 get
 out
 of
 a
 leap.


He'll
 initiate
 a
 position,
 get
 out
 of
 it


the
 next
 week.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 what
 I've


noticed
 about
 Sam.
 And
 that's
 just
 how


he
 invests.
 Like,
 he
 does
 not
 want
 to


hold
 on
 for
 the
 ride
 if
 he
 thinks
 things


are
 getting
 a
 little
 weird.


So,


yeah,
 I
 I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 I
 haven't


heard
 a
 piece
 of
 analysis
 on
 the


structural
 problem
 in
 the
 underlying


economy
 that
 would
 say
 stocks
 aren't
 in


a
 more
 obvious
 buy
 the
 dip
 situation.


The
 only
 other
 argument
 you
 can
 make
 is


that
 we're
 going
 to
 decouple
 with
 China.


But
 then
 this
 morning,
 Trump
 is
 like,


"No,
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 even
 do
 the
 100%


tariffs."
 That
 was
 the
 reason
 the


markets
 fell
 last
 week.
 And
 China's


foreign
 minister
 came
 out
 yesterday
 and


said,
 "We
 want
 to
 work
 with
 the
 US."
 So


that's
 not
 the
 structural
 problem.


It's
 not
 the
 regional
 bank
 stuff.
 It


It's
 more
 so
 I
 agree
 with
 his
 last
 point


right
 here.
 October
 is
 the
 month
 we
 tend


to
 see.
 October
 ends
 up
 being
 Balt.


Tesla
 going
 green.
 Tesla
 437.
 All right.


You're
 getting
 some
 of
 these
 stocks.
 Oh,


S&P
 high
 of
 day.


Can
 we
 break
 663?
 Can
 we
 break
 through?


Maybe.
 Can
 we
 break
 through?


Structurally,
 there's
 no
 money
 with
 50%


of
 the
 people
 out
 there.
 Fair
 point.


However,
 oh,
 we
 didn't
 even
 check
 money


market
 funds
 yesterday.
 Let's
 do
 it


right
 now
 together.
 I
 was
 going
 to
 talk


about
 money
 market
 funds
 being
 where
 the


money
 is.


Decrease
 $17
 billion
 decrease
 yesterday.


7.37
 trillion.
 So,
 my
 response
 to
 people


don't
 have
 money
 is
 there's
 money.
 It's


out
 there.


And
 eventually
 it's
 going
 to
 find
 its


way
 to
 come
 into
 taking
 a
 little
 bit


more
 risk
 than
 it's
 taking
 right
 now.


But
 you
 had
 a
 decrease
 last
 week
 of
 17


billion,
 which
 is
 a
 drop
 in
 the
 bucket,


but
 at least
 it's
 a
 decrease
 versus
 an


increase.
 Still
 7
 trillion
 on
 the


sidelines.
 S&P,
 do
 we
 break
 663?
 We
 just


broke
 663.
 Okay,
 maybe
 we're
 making
 a


trend.
 Hims
 is
 getting
 destroyed
 right


now
 as
 the
 market's
 going
 higher.


Goodness
 gracious.
 10%
 on
 HIMS.
 5313.


That's
 getting
 hit.
 Micro
 Strategyy's
 up


one.
 Nvidia's
 up
 half.
 Tesla's
 up
 two.


Pounders
 up
 1.3
 grabs
 back
 above
 560.


AMD
 is
 up
 and
 then
 S&P
 if
 we
 can
 great


get
 665
 that
 would
 really


maybe
 create
 some
 stronger
 momentum.


But
 we
 got
 to
 see
 $8
 million
 flow
 of


puts
 on
 gold.


$12
 million
 worth
 of
 calls
 sold
 on
 gold.


All right.
 People
 are
 getting
 bearish


gold.


Some
 of
 the
 option
 traders
 are
 getting


bearish.
 selling
 12
 million
 worth
 of


calls
 and
 sell
 and
 buying
 8
 million


worth
 of
 puts.


Yeah,
 you're
 getting


you're
 getting
 some
 premium
 coming
 in.


That's
 a
 bit
 more
 bearish.
 S&P
 high
 of


day
 66350.


Where's
 gold
 right
 now?
 Let's
 see.
 Gold


was
 at
 42.
 Yeah,
 still
 down.
 Gold
 and


silver
 still
 getting
 hit.


All
 the
 gold
 and
 silver
 ETFs
 are


dropping
 right
 now.
 Well,
 it's
 probably


because
 of
 that
 option
 flow.
 Yeah,
 GLD.


That
 one's
 also
 down.
 Tesla's
 still
 437.


Intel
 still
 going
 up.


How
 about
 the
 rare
 earths?
 Intel.
 Wow.


4%
 on
 Intel.


I
 look
 if
 there's
 a
 headline,
 but


Intel's
 doing
 okay.
 Regionals.
 Look
 at


that.
 Green
 across
 the
 board.


Huntington,
 KRE,
 Truis,
 Zions,
 all
 the


re
 Look
 at
 Zion
 getting
 6%.
 It
 lost
 15%


yesterday.
 That's
 not
 a
 horrible


somewhat
 recovery
 from
 yesterday.
 Rare


Earths
 are
 still
 red
 except
 CRML.
 That


one
 goes
 down.
 I
 mean,
 that
 one
 goes
 up.


And
 then
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners
 are
 still


all
 red
 even
 though
 they're
 trying
 to


recover
 as
 well.


VIX
 down
 8%.
 Okay,
 that's
 a
 bigger
 move


on
 the
 VIX.
 That's
 what
 we
 needed
 to


see.
 We
 needed
 to
 see
 the
 VIX
 get
 down


to
 that
 8
 to
 10%
 level.
 S&P
 again


continuing
 to
 get
 to
 highs
 of
 days.
 VIX


low
 of
 days
 as
 of
 so
 far.


Hopefully
 that
 can
 continue.


Uh


oh
 [ __ ]
 Hold
 on.
 It
 is
 Tanner's


birthday
 today.


It
 is
 Tanner's
 birthday,
 right?
 Or
 am
 I


wrong?


Hold
 on.
 This
 is
 why
 this
 guy
 probably


slept
 in.


Or
 am
 I
 am
 I
 wrong?
 Hold
 on.
 We're
 gonna


call
 this
 guy
 right
 now.
 We
 got
 to
 know.


Is
 it
 his
 birthday?
 I
 think
 it
 is
 his


birthday,
 right?
 It
 is
 his
 birthday.


There
 it
 is.
 It's
 his
 birthday.


It
 is
 all
 right.
 Happy
 birthday,
 Mr.


Tanner.


Bro,


>> bro,


>> happy
 birthday,
 bro.


>> Thank
 you.
 Appreciate
 it.


>> So,
 for
 your
 birthday,
 you
 got
 to
 sleep


in
 and
 didn't
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 the
 2


a.m.
 trauma
 that
 that
 we
 had
 to
 deal


with.


>> I
 still
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 happened,


>> dude.
 No
 one
 does.
 Literally,
 no
 one


does.
 So,


uh,
 wait,
 how
 old
 are
 you
 turning
 today?


20
 27


>> 28.


>> Oh,
 28.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Same
 same
 with
 me.


>> I'm
 like
 a
 week
 older
 than
 you.


>> Okay.
 So,
 um
 yeah.
 How
 do
 you
 feel
 about


being
 28?


>> Um


I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 not
 really
 a


milestone
 birthday.
 Um
 so,
 the
 same.
 I'm


waiting
 for
 30
 though.
 That'll
 be


different.


>> Okay.
 Are
 are
 you
 doing
 anything
 with


your
 with
 your
 girl
 tonight?
 Are
 you


going
 anywhere
 or
 just
 chilling
 in
 the


house?


>> Uh
 probably
 not.
 No.


Just
 chilling.


>> I
 love
 it.
 Well,
 dude,


>> I'll
 be
 uh
 I'll
 be
 working.


>> You'll
 be
 working.
 That's
 what
 we
 do.


That
 is
 what
 Dude,
 I
 forgot
 last
 night.


I
 didn't
 even
 realize
 it
 was
 your


birthday.
 That's
 awesome,
 dude.
 So,
 Oh,


that's
 great.
 Happy
 birthday
 to
 you,


man.
 Deeply,
 deeply
 appreciate
 you
 as
 a


friend.
 I'm
 happy
 we're
 on
 this
 whole


content
 journey
 together.
 And
 uh
 last


question.
 Should
 I
 should
 I
 buy
 SoFi?


Like,
 yeah,
 I
 love
 you,
 bro,
 but
 like
 uh


can
 you
 give
 me
 some
 financial
 advice?


Um,


I
 think
 that
 this
 will
 be
 the
 greatest


quarter
 they've
 ever
 seen.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 you
 should
 do
 with


your
 money.
 The
 stock
 doesn't
 seem
 to


align
 with
 what
 the


um
 with
 what
 the
 stock
 does
 or
 or
 what


the
 company
 actually
 performs
 at,
 but
 I


think
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 blowout


quarter.
 Absolute
 blowout.


>> All right.
 I
 love
 it.
 I'm
 putting


Tanner's
 YouTube
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat.


If
 you
 haven't
 watched
 his
 video
 on
 so


far
 yesterday,
 you
 definitely
 should.


He's
 thinking
 1
 million
 members
 comes


out
 uh
 comes
 out
 for
 Q3.


>> I
 had
 I
 had
 a
 person
 correct
 me
 online


saying
 that
 I
 was
 using
 net
 new
 members


and
 not
 you
 know
 before
 churn.
 So
 they


corrected
 me
 to
 say
 hey
 it's
 going
 to


actually
 be
 higher
 than
 1
 million.


>> Wow.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 mean
 that
 would
 be
 pretty
 incredible.


Well


>> let's
 see.
 Fingers
 crossed.


>> All
 right
 Tanner.
 Appreciate
 you.
 Enjoy


the
 birthday
 man
 and
 uh
 have
 a
 good
 one.


Yeah.
 We'll
 talk
 to
 you
 later.
 Peace.


Dude,
 Tanner
 and
 I,
 we
 are
 becoming


unks.
 We
 are
 becoming
 straight
 up
 unks


as
 we
 get
 into
 our
 30s.
 So
 S&P
 losing


663,
 but
 holding
 662
 again.
 Up
 and
 down,


up
 and
 down
 across
 the
 board.
 Tesla


right
 there,
 439.
 Tesla
 getting
 a
 little


bit
 of
 love.
 Grab
 getting
 a
 little
 bit


of
 love.
 Uh
 ESTS
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 Rocket


Lab
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 Disney's
 up
 1%.
 A


bounced
 from
 82.
 Nvidia
 high
 of
 day
 or


it
 was
 at
 183
 just
 below
 183.


But
 yeah,
 we
 are
 losing


we
 are
 losing
 663.
 Let's
 uh
 let's
 head


over
 to
 Dan
 Niles.
 Let's
 see
 what
 he's


got
 to
 say
 about
 everything
 going
 on


>> at
 it
 in
 total
 and
 you
 look
 at
 the
 four


biggest
 banks
 in
 the
 world
 that
 reported


in
 the
 US.
 um
 you
 know,
 Bank
 of
 America,


JP
 Morgan,
 Wells
 Fargo,
 and
 then
 you


look
 at
 the
 two
 biggest
 investment


banks,
 Goldman
 Sachs,
 Morgan
 Stanley.


Combined,
 that's
 11
 trillion
 in
 assets.


Every
 single
 one
 of
 them
 had
 revenue
 and


EPS
 forecasts
 go
 up
 for
 December.
 Every


single
 one
 of
 them
 was
 generally


constructive
 on,
 you
 know,
 what
 they


were
 seeing
 in
 terms
 of
 consumer


strength.
 So
 you're
 yes
 do
 you
 have
 some


issues
 with
 fraud
 100%.
 Are
 there


probably
 more
 definitely
 but
 in
 general


which
 is
 what
 you
 have
 to
 look
 at
 things


seem
 very
 good
 on
 that
 front.
 So
 I
 don't


think
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 turn
 out
 to
 be


something
 systemic
 like
 you
 saw
 in
 March


of
 23
 or
 obviously
 when
 Lehman
 Brothers


failed.
 And
 so
 you're
 seeing
 this


morning
 I
 think
 you
 saw
 an
 upgrade
 of


Jeff.
 You've
 seen
 you
 know
 uh
 Western


Alliance
 as
 well
 as
 Zion's.
 They're
 up
 I


think
 four
 to
 6%
 last
 time.


>> Got
 them
 right
 next
 to
 your
 face
 right


now.
 Yep.
 We
 just
 saw
 them.
 Exactly.


>> Good
 call.
 You
 had
 it
 exactly
 right,


Dan.


>> Um
 and
 there's
 Jeff
 as
 well.
 Um


>> All right.
 So,
 but
 so
 what
 it's
 rate


cuts
 essentially
 that
 are
 going
 to
 just


keep
 this
 rally
 going.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 it.
 And
 really,


you've
 seen
 that
 since
 co,
 right?
 Like


unless
 you
 think
 a
 global
 pandemic
 is


wonderful.
 The
 S&P
 was
 up
 14%
 that
 year.


And
 why
 was
 that?
 Well,
 you
 jammed
 about


half
 of
 GDP
 into
 the
 economy
 over
 the


period
 of
 two
 years
 in
 terms
 of


stimulus.
 And
 so,
 you're
 seeing
 you're


going
 to
 see
 a
 rate
 cut
 on
 October
 29th.


I
 think
 you'll
 see
 another
 one
 in


December
 10th.
 The
 Fed
 has
 decided


whatever
 inflation
 metrics
 they
 see,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 transitory
 just
 like


they
 did
 in
 2021
 when
 the
 market
 S&P


finished
 up
 27%
 despite
 inflation


surging
 from,
 you
 know,
 1.3%
 I
 think
 to


start
 the
 year
 to
 7%
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.
 And
 then
 you've
 got
 strong
 Q3


earnings.
 Don't
 forget
 these
 companies


all
 gave
 guidance
 for
 Q3
 in
 July
 of
 u


you
 know
 last
 year
 when
 it
 wasn't
 that


clear
 that
 we
 would
 be
 in
 as
 good
 a


shape
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 economy
 as
 we
 are


right
 now.
 So
 the
 bar
 was
 set
 really


low.
 And
 then
 the
 AI
 data
 you're
 getting


from
 the
 likes
 of
 TSMC
 or
 ASML,
 they
 all


still
 seem
 very
 positive.
 And
 more


importantly
 with
 regards
 to
 the
 AI
 data,


you've
 had
 some
 very
 um
 compute
 inensive


apps
 released
 recently
 between
 Nano


Banana
 for
 Google
 and
 more
 importantly


Sora
 2
 which
 helps
 you
 generate
 video.


So,
 same
 argument
 by
 Dan
 Niles
 that


earnings
 is
 strong,
 rate
 cuts
 are
 coming


183
 back
 for
 Nvidia,
 even
 though
 the
 S&P


is
 not
 at
 high
 of
 days.
 So,
 Nvidia
 and


Tesla
 getting
 to
 high
 of
 days
 with
 the


S&P
 lagging.
 Um,
 but
 his
 argument
 is
 the


same
 about
 regional
 banks,
 which
 is
 like


they're
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 concern.
 And


the
 rate
 cut,
 by
 the
 way,
 rate
 cuts
 help


the
 regional
 banks
 because
 the
 regional


banks
 are,
 you
 know,
 they
 they
 don't


have
 the
 types
 of
 balance
 sheets
 like
 a


JP
 Morgan.
 And
 you
 know,
 rate
 cuts
 in


general
 help
 every
 bank
 uh
 especially


with
 their
 AOIC
 AOCCI
 losses.
 But
 if
 if


if
 if
 you're
 a
 regional
 and
 you
 have,


you
 know,
 not
 as
 much
 leverage
 as
 a
 JP


Morgan
 when
 you're
 when
 it
 comes
 to


giving
 out
 loans,
 the
 cost
 of
 capital


coming
 down
 really
 does
 help.


So
 even
 if
 there
 is
 some
 issue
 with


regionals,
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be


something
 that
 rate
 cuts
 won't
 at least


somewhat
 help
 with.


Um
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 183
 on
 the
 day.


Tesla


440.


Yeah,
 maybe
 this
 is
 also
 setting
 up
 for


a
 nice
 Santa
 Claus
 rally.
 You
 know,


maybe
 that's
 another
 thing
 that
 could


end
 up
 playing
 out
 right
 here.


Um,


you
 know,
 ultimately
 we're
 going
 to
 have


to
 see,
 but


it'll
 be
 one
 of
 those
 things
 that's


important.


>> You
 know,
 ultimately,


>> um,
 let
 me
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.
 I


think
 my
 screen
 froze
 for
 a
 second,
 but


you
 guys
 should
 still
 be
 able
 to
 hear


me.


See
 if
 we
 have
 any
 other
 headlines


coming
 in.
 Gold
 is
 still
 going
 down.


Um,
 BMR
 below
 49.
 Nvidia
 really
 making
 a


move
 right
 there.
 Look
 at
 that
 green


candle.
 Yeah,
 actually
 getting
 a
 pump.


Bit
 mine
 4926.


That
 one's
 still
 going
 to
 hit.
 Is
 Misti


a
 buy
 right
 here?
 Misti
 has
 been
 a


disaster.
 It's
 because
 Micro
 Strategy


has
 been
 a
 disaster.
 So,
 no.
 Oh,
 I
 think


it's
 a
 buy
 if
 you
 believe
 Micro
 Strategy


reverses.
 If
 it
 doesn't,
 you
 stay
 the


hell
 away


because
 unless
 Micro
 Strategy
 reverses,


you're
 likely
 not
 going
 to
 see
 too
 much


momentum.


Um,


but
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 the
 core
 issue


that
 we're
 having
 right
 now.


Uh,
 Tesla
 440.
 Okay.
 So,
 Tesla
 holds
 up


to
 be
 green.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 headline
 is
 on
 T.


Is
 there
 a
 headline
 on
 Tesla?


I
 mean,
 okay,
 so
 there's
 no
 headline
 on


Tesla.
 There
 is
 this
 video
 last
 night,


though,
 that
 probably
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't


know if
 it's
 helping
 the
 stock
 today,


but
 definitely
 a
 good
 video
 to
 see.


>> How's
 it
 going?


>> Good.
 How's
 it
 going?


>> Is
 this
 your
 office?
 Uh,
 this
 is
 this
 is


the
 rocket
 factory.
 The
 SpaceX
 rocket


factory
 at
 Star
 Base,
 Texas.


>> I
 just
 want
 everybody
 in
 the
 world
 to


hear
 that
 you
 said
 I
 build
 bigger
 things


than
 you
 do.


>> Uh,
 you
 do.


>> The
 data
 centers
 are
 very
 enormous.


>> It
 all
 started
 in
 2016.
 I
 announced
 the


world's
 first
 AI
 supercomput.


>> The
 DGX1,


>> the
 most
 advanced
 computer
 that
 anyone


has
 ever
 built.


>> It
 was
 just
 crickets.


>> Crickets


>> except
 for
 one
 person.


>> And
 it
 was
 that
 sounds
 like
 a
 great


idea.


>> So
 I
 built
 another
 DGX.


>> Great.


>> And
 this
 thing
 is
 mighty.
 This
 is
 the


new
 DGX
 Spark.


>> So
 that's
 the
 whole
 thing.


>> Wow.
 Five
 times
 the
 computational
 power


of
 DJX1.


40
 watts,
 not
 40.


>> Wow.


>> DJX1
 to
 DJX
 Spark.


>> It's
 so
 fun
 hanging
 out.
 Thanks
 for


having
 me.


>> Welcome
 to


>> I
 can't
 wait
 to
 see
 my
 first
 rocket


launcher.


>> It's
 just
 incredible.


>> That's
 pretty
 cool
 to
 see.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 that's
 necessarily
 changing
 the


dynamics
 of
 Tesla,
 but
 it
 is
 nice
 to
 see


that
 right
 there.
 Tesla
 438.


And
 he
 is
 with
 Jensen.
 Yeah,
 dude.
 Elon


does
 make
 Jensen
 look
 much
 smaller.
 How


tall
 is
 Jensen?
 How
 tall
 is
 Jensen
 Hang?


5'9.
 Okay,
 Elon
 6'2.
 He
 definitely
 looks


like
 a
 tank
 compared
 to
 Jensen,


but
 there
 you
 go.
 438
 right
 there
 on


Tessie.
 And
 on
 drone
 stock,
 this
 one,


how
 are
 they
 down
 for
 the
 week?
 Yeah,


look
 at
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 this
 thing's
 down


21%
 this
 week.
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 high-f


flyers,
 guys,
 they're
 taking
 it
 on
 the


chin
 this
 week.
 And
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that


everything
 else
 isn't,
 but
 some
 of these


guys
 are
 some
 of
 these
 guys
 are
 really,


you
 know,
 just
 taking
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 a


beating.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 okay,


especially
 when
 these
 names
 were
 up
 5%


every
 day
 for
 the
 past
 month
 for


literally
 no
 reason.
 Like,
 it's
 okay
 for


them
 to
 take
 a
 breather.
 That's
 normal.


Dwave
 down
 8%.
 Dwave
 is
 now
 down
 18%


this
 week.
 Is
 that
 the
 case?


Well,
 in
 the
 past
 two
 days,
 it
 was
 down


10%
 yesterday,
 18%
 or
 8%
 today.
 So,
 18%


over
 the
 past
 two
 days.


Um,
 could
 they
 reverse?
 Yeah,
 I
 think


they
 could,
 but
 it's
 not
 horrible.
 Also,


if
 you're
 an
 owner
 of
 these
 stocks,
 I


think
 you're
 also
 okay
 with
 them
 just


taking
 a
 breather.
 Like,
 it's
 annoying


for
 Hood
 to
 go
 from
 150
 to
 129,
 but
 I


also
 think
 it's
 healthy
 for
 it
 to
 take
 a


breather
 and
 not
 go
 to
 the
 moon.
 I
 mean,


like,
 it
 didn't
 really
 deserve
 150


outside
 of
 the
 S&P
 inclusion,
 which
 was


awesome.
 I
 think
 it
 deserved,
 you
 know,


closer
 to
 130
 where
 it's
 at
 right
 now
 on


that,
 maybe
 140,
 but
 150
 is
 just
 like


that's
 just
 pure
 hype
 at
 that
 point.


Like,
 I
 can't
 justify
 that
 as
 a


shareholder.


So
 you
 need
 you
 need
 earnings.
 You
 need


that
 earnings
 to
 come
 through
 to
 make
 it


happen.


Nebi
 is
 down
 14%
 in
 a
 week.
 Yeah,
 dude.


Again,
 Nebby
 is
 amazing
 company,
 but
 did


they
 deserve
 to
 go
 from
 90,
 no
 70
 to
 140


in
 a
 month?
 Like
 I
 know
 they
 got
 a
 big


deal
 from
 Microsoft,
 but
 is
 that


reasonable?
 I
 mean,
 like
 some
 of
 this


stuff's
 just
 not
 as
 reasonable.


I
 think
 that's
 okay.


Yeah,
 the
 Bitcoin
 whale
 didn't
 actually


go
 long.
 Tom
 Lee
 actually
 ended
 up


sharing
 a
 a
 fake
 tweet.
 And
 it's
 not
 his


fault.
 It's
 just
 sometimes
 these
 tweets


don't
 end
 up
 being
 as
 accurate.
 That


Bitcoin
 whale
 that
 we
 thought
 went
 long,


the
 same
 guy
 who
 shorted


uh
 Bitcoin
 right
 before
 Trump
 did
 the


Truth
 Social
 China
 Post.
 Yeah,
 that


turned
 out
 to
 be
 fake.
 And
 so,


unfortunately,
 that
 was
 not
 true.
 Also,


the
 3pm
 announcement
 yesterday
 uh
 was


about
 freaking
 uh
 in
 vitro


fertilization,
 not
 even
 the
 stock.
 So,


whatever
 announcement
 that
 was
 supposed


to
 happen
 yesterday
 that
 everyone
 was


prepared
 for,
 it
 ended
 up
 literally


being
 a
 nothing
 burger
 in
 the
 context
 of


the
 market.
 Uh,
 here's
 an
 update
 on
 a


shutdown.
 Let's
 go
 to
 this.


>> At
 this
 time,
 there
 are
 some
 bipartisan


talks
 going
 on,
 but
 even
 Republican


senators
 who
 tell
 me
 that
 they
 want
 to


work
 with
 Democrats
 on
 their
 big
 ask,


remember
 that's
 extending
 those


Affordable
 Care
 Act
 tax
 credits.
 They


tell
 me
 that
 they
 don't
 see
 a
 firm


working
 group
 really
 coalescing.
 I
 also


spoke
 with
 a
 couple
 Democrats,
 including


Senator
 Chris
 Coons.
 He
 said
 part
 of
 the


difference
 this
 time
 is
 that
 even
 if


Democrats
 and
 Republicans
 come
 to
 an


agreement,
 as
 they
 have
 in
 the
 past
 on


things
 like
 spending
 bills,
 the
 Trump


administration
 has
 previously
 undermined


them,
 as
 they
 did
 when
 they
 canceled


billions
 in
 funding
 that
 lawmakers


approved.


There's
 been
 a
 loss
 of
 trust
 between


Senate
 Democrats
 and
 the
 administration


and
 the
 House
 because
 of
 what's
 happened


over
 the
 last
 6
 to9
 months
 in
 terms
 of


respecting
 bipartisan
 spending
 bills


that
 were
 signed
 into
 law
 last
 year.


>> Meanwhile,
 Republican
 leaders
 have
 also


been
 in
 lock
 step
 and
 say
 no


negotiations
 on
 healthcare
 until
 the


government
 reopens.
 Senator
 John
 Cornin,


he's
 a
 Republican
 and
 he's
 been
 part
 of


groups
 tackling
 immigration
 and
 gun


reform
 in
 the
 past,
 is
 now
 saying
 that


Democrats,
 including
 Senator
 Chuck


Schumer,
 seem
 more
 comfortable
 being
 in


a
 shutdown.


>> I
 think
 he's
 afraid
 to
 reach
 some
 sort


of
 deal
 like
 we
 typically
 do
 in
 these


circumstances
 because
 he'll
 be
 attacked


by
 his
 progressive
 radical
 base.
 with
 a


lack
 of
 trust
 and
 both
 sides
 digging
 in.


It
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 a
 shutdown
 is
 going


to
 be
 over
 anytime
 soon.
 Senate,
 as
 you


said,
 out
 today,
 not
 planning
 to
 come


back
 until
 Monday.
 Meanwhile,
 the
 House


has
 now
 been
 out
 for
 almost
 a
 month
 and


they
 have
 no
 planned
 return
 until
 the


shutdown
 is
 over.
 David.


>> So
 Emily,
 you
 know,
 of
 the
 two
 issues,


one,
 the
 Affordable
 Care
 Act
 and
 the


subsidies
 which
 are
 going
 to
 go
 away,


uh,
 or
 the
 fact
 that
 Congress
 has


appropriated
 money
 that
 the


administration
 will
 not
 spend,
 which
 is


at
 the
 four
 now.
 I
 feel
 like,
 you
 know,


was
 all
 about
 the
 Affordable
 Care
 Act,


but
 we've
 been
 hearing
 a
 lot
 more
 about


that
 other
 issue
 of
 late.
 And
 I
 think


David,
 that's
 because
 when
 it
 comes
 to


Congress,
 I
 mean,
 really,
 you
 you
 hear


about
 these
 shutdown
 fights
 every
 year,


but
 behind
 the
 scenes,
 there
 really
 is


bipartisan
 negotiations
 that
 go
 on


throughout
 the
 year
 about
 exactly
 how


they're
 going
 to
 fund
 the
 government.
 I


mean,
 right
 now,
 we're
 talking
 about
 a


stop
 gap
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 actually
 how


the
 government
 will
 be
 funded
 for
 next


year,
 fiscal
 2026.
 There
 is
 a
 bunch
 of


bipartisan
 agreements
 that
 have
 already


been
 done,
 already
 on
 paper.
 And
 so


having
 that
 recisions
 process
 and
 the


White
 House
 kind
 of
 undermining
 that


previously
 bipartisan
 agreement
 that
 has


caused
 a
 lot
 of
 kind
 of
 internal


concern.
 But
 I
 think
 when
 it
 comes
 to


messaging,
 most
 Americans
 don't
 know


what
 a
 recision
 package
 is.
 But
 they
 do


know
 what
 their
 healthcare
 is.
 They
 do


know
 what
 their
 insurance
 premium
 is.


And
 they
 do
 know
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 go


up
 if
 we
 don't
 see
 these
 tax
 credits


have
 some
 sort
 of
 extension.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 there
 is
 no
 resolve
 on
 uh


on
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 this
 shutdown


based
 on
 what
 she's
 saying.
 By
 the
 way,


S&P
 losing
 pretty
 much
 everything
 that


it
 had
 the
 past
 10
 minutes.
 Dude,
 I


don't
 think
 we've
 had
 a
 day
 like
 this
 in


a
 while.
 Up
 and
 down,
 up
 and
 down,
 up


and
 down.
 New
 alltime
 or
 not
 new
 all


time.
 I
 have
 new
 intraday
 high,
 new


intraday
 low,
 new
 intraday
 high.
 BMR


getting
 wrecked.
 4864.


Ethereum
 getting
 wrecked.
 37
 hundo.


Bitcoin
 continuing
 to
 get
 wrecked.
 It


was
 just
 at
 106.


10
 minutes
 ago


back
 down
 to
 104.


It's
 one
 of those
 days,
 folks.
 It's
 one


of
 those
 days.


What
 else
 do
 you
 do
 on
 a
 day
 like
 this?


Honestly,
 what
 else
 do
 you
 do
 other
 than


just
 like


forget
 about
 it
 and
 be
 like,
 "All
 right,


whatever."


We've
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 exciting
 days
 in
 the


market.
 We've
 we
 we've
 to
 the
 upside.


We've
 also
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 days
 to
 the


downside
 where
 we
 we
 kind
 of
 know
 why


there's
 downside.
 Today's
 one
 of
 those


days
 where


I
 think
 we
 might
 end
 out
 flat
 hopefully


and
 whether
 we're
 up
 or
 down,
 I
 mean


it's
 it
 might
 not
 be
 conclusive
 in
 any


narrative.
 It
 might
 just
 be
 a
 day
 in


October
 where
 we
 revolve.


That's
 it.


Yeah.
 June
 says,
 "Good
 day
 to
 take
 a
 day


away
 from
 the
 market."
 Yeah,
 dude.
 I


mean,
 sometimes
 it's
 also
 it's
 healthy


to
 not
 think
 about
 this
 [ __ ]
 I
 think
 I


think
 I
 think
 that
 that
 is
 something
 we


don't
 talk
 about
 enough
 that
 the
 mental


health
 of
 investors
 all
 of
 us
 here
 you


know
 this
 is
 real
 hardearned
 money
 that


we're
 deploying
 on
 our
 own
 right
 most
 of


us
 like
 doing
 our
 own
 due
 diligence
 to


to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 make
 this
 money


turn
 into
 something
 to
 help
 our
 our


families
 which
 is
 I
 think
 the
 reason


most
 of
 us
 invest
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day


like
 if
 you
 had
 to
 boil
 it
 down
 I
 think


I
 think
 95%
 of
 people
 here
 would
 say
 we


we
 you
 invest
 for
 your
 family
 first
 and


foremost
 in
 some
 way
 or
 another
 your
 one


of
 your
 like
 top
 three
 goals
 as
 an


investor
 is
 to
 be
 able
 to
 return


something
 to
 to
 your
 family.
 And
 that,


you
 know,
 that's
 a
 mental
 burden
 because


when
 you
 lose
 money,
 you
 almost
 feel


like
 you're
 letting
 your
 family
 down
 to


an
 extent,
 right?
 And
 it's
 like
 that's


not
 true.
 So,
 it's
 like
 you
 have
 to
 be


able
 to
 manage
 the
 the
 highs
 with
 the


lows.


Yep.
 Saving
 all
 I
 can
 for
 my
 family.
 For


my
 family,
 100%
 for
 my
 family.
 I
 I'm


sure
 some
 people,
 you
 know,
 are
 doing
 it


just
 purely
 for
 themselves,
 which
 is


fine,
 but
 I
 think
 the
 majority
 of


people,
 you
 know,
 they
 want
 to
 get
 some


level
 of
 financial
 freedom
 or,
 you
 know,


you
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 something
 with


the
 capital
 one
 day
 that
 affects
 other


people
 that
 are
 close
 to
 you.


And,
 you
 know,
 that's
 why
 most
 people


invest
 S&P
 500
 right
 there,
 66120.


I'm
 doing
 it
 for
 the
 drugs.


I'm
 doing
 it
 for
 the
 dopamine.


Gonna
 buy
 a
 Lambo
 for
 the
 fan,
 but
 only


I
 can
 drive
 it.
 Oh
 my
 gosh,
 that's


hilarious.


I
 don't
 think
 I
 would
 ever
 buy
 a
 Lambo,


bro.
 The
 only
 actual
 money
 I've
 spent
 on


a
 car
 in
 my
 life
 that's
 like
 more
 than


what
 the
 average
 car
 would
 cost
 as
 a


Tesla.
 And
 that's
 because
 it's
 a


freaking
 Tesla.


But
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 would
 ever
 get
 like


a
 luxury
 car
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 I'm


just
 not
 a
 car
 guy.


But
 I
 understand
 people
 who
 who
 like
 it


for
 my
 snowmobile.


Uh
 I
 do
 it
 because
 I'm
 addicted
 to
 being


a
 DJ.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 we're
 all
 staring
 at


candles
 every
 day
 for
 eight
 hours
 a
 day.


Like
 that
 there's
 definitely
 that
 DJ
 in


us.
 Yeah.
 10:30
 slam.
 We
 might
 be


getting
 that
 as
 well.
 Let's
 take
 a
 look


at
 the
 heat
 map
 again.


But
 like
 I
 I
 do
 think
 it
 it
 is
 a
 thing,


bro.
 It's
 like
 one
 Trump
 tweet
 about


soybeans
 and
 your
 day
 is
 messed
 up.


You
 have
 some
 green.
 It's
 flat,
 but
 you


do
 have
 some
 green.
 It's
 like
 a
 legit


thing,
 bro.
 It's
 like
 It's
 like
 you're


having
 a
 good
 day,
 one
 tweet,
 and
 then


you're
 just
 like
 thinking
 about
 it
 the


whole
 day,
 and
 it's
 like
 you
 just
 you


can't
 be
 that
 deep
 in
 it
 sometimes.
 But


then
 again,
 it's
 hard
 to
 say.
 It's


almost
 like
 it's
 almost
 like
 work
 life


balance,
 right?
 It's
 like
 you
 can't
 be


like
 if
 you're
 building
 a
 business,
 you


can't
 be
 that
 obsessed
 with
 the
 business


because
 then
 you're,
 you
 know,
 you're


going
 to
 miss
 out
 on
 other
 parts
 of


life.
 But
 it's
 also
 like
 if
 you're
 not


that
 obsessed
 with
 the
 business,
 are
 you


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 build
 a
 good


business?
 And
 it's
 S&P
 goes
 red.
 It's


almost
 the
 same
 thing
 here
 with


investing.
 Sometimes
 you
 do
 have
 to
 be


obsessed
 with
 it.


Um,
 and
 it
 doesn't
 change
 based
 on
 the


amount
 of
 wealth
 you
 have.
 It
 really


doesn't.
 I
 mean,
 from
 the
 people
 I've


talked
 to
 that
 have
 that
 have
 amassed


more
 wealth,
 I
 mean,
 like
 they
 like
 they


check
 their
 accounts
 every
 day.
 They


take
 a
 look
 at
 it
 multiple
 times
 a
 day.


Like
 that
 [ __ ]
 doesn't
 change
 just


because
 you
 have
 more
 money.
 It
 becomes


even,
 you
 know,
 more
 compelling
 to
 see


the
 numbers
 go
 up
 or
 down.
 So
 once


you're
 in
 the
 game,
 once
 you're
 in
 the


matrix,
 you're
 in
 the
 matrix.
 You're
 in


it.
 And
 you
 got
 to
 be
 able
 to
 take
 your


own
 breaks.
 Like
 for
 me,
 it's
 Saturday.


Saturday,
 I
 legit
 try
 to
 not
 think
 about


the
 market
 at
 all.
 And
 last
 week,


Saturday
 was
 after
 the
 3%
 draw
 down
 on


Friday.
 So,
 you
 know,
 it
 was
 hard
 not
 to


think
 about
 it.
 But
 I
 really
 do
 try
 to


say
 Saturday.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 even
 try


to
 think
 about
 the
 stock
 market.


Um,
 Matt
 said,
 "I'm
 going
 to
 get
 a
 bagel


and
 coffee."
 Does
 anyone
 want
 anything?


Matt,
 go
 to
 Dutch
 Bros.
 You
 got
 to
 pump


the
 stock.


Got
 to
 pump
 the
 stock.
 What
 did
 everyone


eat
 for
 breakfast
 today?
 Put
 in
 the


chat.
 What
 did
 you
 guys
 eat
 for


breakfast?


I
 had
 nothing
 because
 I
 don't
 eat


breakfast.
 What
 do
 people
 eat?
 Let's
 see


some
 good
 breakfastes,
 bro.
 Dude,
 I
 went


to
 this
 uh
 this
 like
 diner
 near
 me
 the


other
 day
 and
 it
 was
 so
 bad.
 Like
 I
 was


like
 I'm
 kind
 of
 like
 I'm
 I'm
 like


making
 a
 budget
 for
 money
 that
 I
 know


I'm
 going
 to
 lose
 trying
 out
 new
 food


spots
 near
 near
 the
 apartment
 and
 just


telling
 myself,
 look,
 if
 I
 lose
 50
 bucks


on
 this
 meal,
 then
 at least
 it's
 a


lesson
 for
 me
 to
 never
 go
 back
 to
 the


space.
 Like
 I
 went
 to
 a
 pizza
 shop
 the


other
 day,
 disgusting
 pizza,
 and
 this
 is


New
 Jersey.
 I'm
 like,
 how
 is
 the
 pizza


that
 bad?
 I'm
 like,
 "Well,
 that
 was
 a


$10
 lesson
 to
 never
 go
 back
 to
 that


spot."
 And
 so,
 I
 went
 to
 a
 breakfast


spot
 in
 uh
 last
 week,
 I
 think
 on
 Sunday,


and
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 "This
 is
 like
 it


was
 a
 pancake
 spot."
 And
 I
 was
 like,


"All
 right,
 let's
 get
 some
 good


pancakes."
 And
 the
 pancakes
 tasted
 like,


you
 know,
 you
 expect
 a
 certain
 type
 of


feeling
 from
 a
 pancake
 when
 you
 go
 to
 a


nice
 spot.
 And
 I
 was
 like, "This
 looks


this
 this
 feels
 like
 a
 cafeteria
 pancake


when
 I
 was
 in
 high
 school."


And
 so


you
 gota
 you
 got
 to
 take
 some
 of
 those


hits
 when
 you're
 going
 to
 new
 places.


Everyone
 saying
 coffee,
 bro.
 Does


everyone
 here
 just
 drink
 coffee?
 Coffee


and
 toast.
 Cold
 brew.
 Pistachios.
 I
 ate


Red
 candles.
 Well,
 you're
 continuing
 to


eat
 the
 red
 candles.
 Red
 Bull.
 Okay.
 Red


Bull
 for
 breakfast
 is
 wild.
 Red
 Bull
 for


breakfast
 is
 wild,
 but
 it
 probably
 gives


you
 some
 energy.
 Tomato
 cheese
 sandwich.


eggs,


pancake,
 coffee,


PB&J.


Jersey
 has
 terrible
 food.
 Jersey
 does


not
 have
 terrible
 food.
 It's
 just
 a


couple
 spots
 near
 me
 just
 weren't
 that


good.
 Jersey
 Jersey
 is
 Dude,
 New
 York


has
 some
 of
 the
 best
 food
 on
 the
 planet.


Jersey
 is
 Amazon,
 by
 the
 way,
 213.


Jersey
 is
 just
 a
 rendition
 of
 a
 lot
 of


the
 culture
 that
 comes
 in
 New
 York
 with


food.


So,
 I
 think
 there
 is
 decent
 food
 here.


Peanut
 butter
 sandwich.
 Then
 pre-workout


for
 the
 gym.


Indian
 food.
 Bananas.


Eight
 cups
 of
 coffee.
 Not
 kidding.
 Okay,


some
 of
 you
 guys
 are
 being
 ridiculous,


bro.


Like,
 I
 can
 barely
 finish
 a
 couple
 sips


of
 coffee
 if
 I
 ever
 make
 it.
 Like,
 eight


cups
 of
 coffee
 is


wild.


Um,
 do
 we
 have
 any
 other
 headlines?


Let's
 see.
 Oh
 yeah,
 someone
 said
 we
 want


to
 we
 want
 to
 see
 the
 MNAV
 on
 Micro


Strategy
 and
 how
 it's
 changed.
 So
 let's


do
 let's
 try
 to
 do
 the
 math
 right
 here.


So


we
 we'll
 calculate
 the
 MNAV
 right
 now.


Bit
 Micro
 Strategy
 is
 640,000
 Bitcoin.


Um
 640,250.


Is
 that
 the
 number?
 Yeah,
 250.
 So
 what's


the
 current
 price
 of
 Bitcoin?
 Current


price
 of
 Biddy
 is
 105.
 Let's
 just
 do


105.


Okay.
 When
 you
 multiply
 those
 two


numbers,


640,000


times
 105,000.


They
 show
 the
 MNAB
 on
 their
 website.
 Oh,


why
 am
 I
 even
 doing
 all
 this?
 I


Oh
 [ __ ]
 they
 do.
 Oh,
 I'm
 still
 That's


That's
 okay.
 See,
 this
 is
 what
 BitMine


needs
 to
 do.
 I'm
 so
 used
 to
 doing
 this


with
 Bitmine.
 Bit
 mine
 needs
 to
 do
 this


[ __ ]
 Like,
 I
 love
 Tom
 Lee,
 but
 he
 needs


to
 just
 give
 us
 the
 stats
 immediately.


Uh
 1.43.
 43.
 Okay,
 1.4.
 So,
 it's
 still


holding
 a
 1.4
 mnav.


I
 mean,
 not
 horrible,


but
 obviously,
 Bitcoin
 needs
 to
 go


higher.
 US
 M2
 money
 supply
 reached
 a
 new


record
 high,
 22.2
 trillion.
 Okay,
 so


that
 means
 liquidity
 is
 in
 the
 system,


which
 is
 why
 it's
 so
 surprising
 to
 see


Bitcoin
 at
 these
 levels.
 I
 mean,
 guys,


could
 you
 imagine?
 All
 right,
 let's
 do
 a


poll
 right
 here.
 Let's
 do
 our
 own


freaking
 poly
 market
 right
 here.


You
 guys
 have
 been
 more
 accurate
 than


not
 in
 the
 chat.
 All right,
 so
 here's


the
 question.
 Okay,


here
 is
 the
 freaking
 question.
 I
 think


some
 of
 you
 guys
 already
 know
 what
 the


question
 is
 going
 to
 be.


Do
 you
 think


do
 you
 think
 Bitcoin
 goes
 below
 100K


before
 end
 of
 year?


Do
 we
 see
 it
 lose
 six
 figures,
 bro?


That
 is
 the
 question.


It's
 only
 5,000
 away
 from
 doing
 it.
 And


to
 be honest,
 it
 might
 be
 a
 good
 flush


out
 if
 that
 does
 happen,


just
 like
 in
 general.


But
 I
 think
 that
 hurts
 Hoodie,
 that


hurts
 Coinbase,
 that
 hurts
 everything


that's
 tied
 to
 it.
 Hoodie
 right
 there


down
 2%.


Uh
 5050
 52%
 yes.
 48%
 no.


It
 could
 even
 happen
 this
 weekend.
 Yeah,


it
 could
 happen
 this
 weekend.


Where's
 Open
 Door,
 bro?
 Is
 Open
 Door


still
 holding
 seven?


Open
 Door
 is
 holding
 seven
 by
 a
 thread,


bro.
 Does
 anyone
 do Do
 people
 care
 about


Open
 Door
 anymore?
 Are
 we
 done
 with
 Open


Door?
 Was
 this
 just
 like
 a


a
 two-month
 little
 fling
 or
 are
 people


like
 is
 anyone
 here
 buying
 the
 dip
 on


Open
 Door?
 Does
 anyone
 believe
 they're


going
 to
 turn
 things
 around
 and
 they're


going
 to
 get
 a
 margin
 and


the
 real
 estate
 market's
 coming
 back?


I
 mean,
 I
 I
 think
 the
 chatter
 on
 Twitter


has
 died
 down
 substantially,
 like


substantially.


And
 you
 know,
 that's
 the
 thing
 about


some
 of these
 momentum
 stocks.
 the


momentum
 fades,


the
 audience
 fades,
 the
 attention
 fades,


no
 one
 really
 cares
 that
 much
 anymore.


There's
 nothing
 fundamental
 there.
 Like,


it
 is
 really
 sad
 when
 it
 happens.
 I'm


not
 saying
 that's
 going
 to
 happen
 open


door.
 I'm
 just
 saying
 what
 I'm
 seeing
 is


not
 that
 many
 people
 care
 about
 it


anymore.


Um,


a
 couple
 of
 you
 saying
 you're
 still


holding,
 but
 not
 caring
 that
 much.


Um,


okay.
 So,
 that
 one's
 still
 down
 on
 the


day.
 What
 about
 Yeah.
 What
 about
 Better?


What
 about
 Hut?
 What
 about
 the
 other


Eric
 Jackson
 names?
 Better
 is
 up
 1.5.


Hut


is
 down
 two.
 And
 then
 SA,
 that
 was
 the


biotech
 he
 was
 talking
 about.
 That
 one's


down
 four.


A
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 relatively
 flat.


SoFi
 still
 2670.
 And
 then
 the
 S&P
 two


cents
 away
 from
 going
 red
 again.


It's
 pretty
 wild,
 dude.


Pretty
 pretty
 freaking
 wild.
 Meme
 ETF
 is


down
 3%
 on
 the
 day
 as
 well.
 We
 do
 have


some
 new
 clips
 of
 uh
 our
 boy
 Tom
 Lee.
 He


was
 with
 Kathy
 Wood
 yesterday
 talking


more
 about
 ETH
 and
 this
 is
 his


explanation
 on
 why
 he
 thinks
 ETH
 is


gonna
 flip
 Bitcoin


>> 71.
 Uh
 in
 our
 chairman's
 message
 last


month,
 we
 addressed
 how
 gold
 versus
 Wall


Street
 grew
 post
 1971.
 So
 1971
 was
 when


Nixon
 formally
 withdrew
 the
 US
 from
 the


gold
 standard.
 The
 immediate
 beneficiary


was
 there
 was
 demand
 and
 a
 market
 to
 own


gold.
 And
 so
 people
 would
 say
 that
 was


your
 you
 know
 first
 implication.


But
 when
 what
 we
 wrote
 about
 and
 talked


about
 in
 that
 message
 was
 that
 in
 1971


the
 dollar
 became
 fully
 synthetic


because
 it
 was
 no
 longer
 backed
 by


anything
 and
 so
 there
 was
 risk
 that
 the


world
 would
 go
 off
 the
 dollar
 standard.


So
 in
 stepped
 Wall
 Street
 to
 create


products
 to
 propagate
 the
 future
 of
 Wall


Street
 including
 and
 we
 listed
 I
 think


14
 products
 that
 emerged
 over
 the
 next


decade
 from
 money
 market
 funds
 to
 credit


to
 mortgage
 back
 securities
 to
 futures


etc.
 and
 dollar
 dominance
 by
 the
 end
 of


that
 period


went
 from
 27%
 of
 GDP
 terms
 but
 to
 57%
 of


central
 bank
 reserves
 and
 80%
 of


financial
 transaction
 quotes.
 So
 Wall


Street


was
 created
 products
 that
 made
 the


dollar
 dominant
 and
 the
 market
 cap
 of


equities
 um
 today
 is
 40
 trillion


compared
 to
 two
 trillion
 for
 gold.
 So
 in


other
 words,
 gold
 is
 5%
 of
 all
 available


assets.
 And
 so
 in
 2025,
 we
 think


everything
 is
 now
 becoming
 synthetic
 as


we
 or
 tokenized,
 sorry,
 not
 synthetic.


So
 as
 we
 move
 not
 just
 dollars
 onto
 the


blockchain,
 which
 is
 stable
 coins,
 but


we'll
 move
 stocks
 and
 real
 estate,


dollar
 dominance
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the


opportunity
 of
 Ethereum.
 So
 did


>> and
 that's
 where
 he
 also
 thinks
 that
 ETH


flips
 Bitcoin
 because
 Bitcoin
 as
 a
 store


of
 value,
 you
 know,
 Tom
 Le's
 pretty


bullish
 on,
 but
 Ethereum
 as
 the
 new


blockchain
 of
 choice
 for
 tokenizing


everything,
 not
 just
 the
 dollar
 back
 in


1971,
 that
 changes
 the
 entire
 dynamic
 of


how
 Wall
 Street
 thinks
 of
 Ethereum.
 And


look,
 Devin
 Ryan,
 one
 of
 the
 best


analysts
 on
 the
 street
 yesterday,
 he


initiated
 a
 $50
 price
 target
 on
 ESB.
 And


I
 could
 not
 believe
 that
 a
 traditional


Wall
 Street
 dude
 is
 calling
 for
 50
 bucks


on
 ESB.
 ESBet's
 trading
 below
 its
 NAV
 if


I'm
 not
 wrong.


So,
 forget
 ESP
 versus
 BMR.
 The
 point
 is


you
 got
 Wall
 Street
 guys
 B.
 Riley


initiated
 $90
 for
 BMR.
 The
 fact
 that


they're
 thinking
 ETH
 is
 going
 to
 matter


probably
 because
 they're
 talking
 to
 a


lot
 of their
 Wall
 Street
 buddies
 that


are
 saying,
 "Yeah,
 ETH's
 real.
 Tom
 Lee's


right
 about
 this."
 is
 is
 is
 forcing
 them


to
 say,
 "All
 right,
 well,
 our
 clients


are
 probably
 going
 to
 need
 exposure,
 and


these
 ETH
 treasuries
 might
 be
 the
 best


way
 to
 get
 that
 exposure."


So,
 although
 the
 stock
 has
 kind
 of


sucked
 over
 the
 past
 two
 weeks
 because


Ethereum
 has
 sucked,
 that
 thesis,
 I


think,
 is
 very
 intact.


And,
 you
 know,
 we
 don't
 know
 how
 it's


going to
 play
 out,
 but
 I
 think
 one
 could


argue
 that
 it
 will
 play
 out
 more
 to
 the


upside
 than
 not,


but
 we're
 going to
 have
 to
 see.
 We're


gonna
 have
 to
 see
 longterm


how
 this
 actually
 ends
 up
 making
 a
 run.


Uh,
 bowl
 of
 cereal,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $5


super
 chat.
 Hi,
 Mid.
 Thank
 you for
 all


you
 do.
 This
 d
 does
 this
 dip
 make
 you


want
 to
 sell
 Hood
 shares?
 Could
 you


share
 your
 take
 and
 price
 target?
 Uh,


look,
 if
 I
 didn't
 sell
 at
 150,
 I'm
 not


selling
 at
 130.
 Again,
 I
 really
 do
 have


a
 10-year
 horizon
 on
 Hood.
 So,
 I
 mean,


I'm
 the
 wrong
 person
 to
 ask
 because
 I'm


not
 selling.
 Selling
 covered
 calls,
 I


think,
 is
 not
 a
 crazy
 idea
 here.
 If
 you


uh
 you
 know
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 massively


if
 you
 don't
 want
 Hood
 to
 be
 like
 a


cornerstone
 of
 the
 portfolio
 and
 you


know
 maybe
 you're
 in
 it
 just
 for
 a
 trade


then
 sure
 you
 know
 because
 because
 by


the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 if
 we
 don't
 get
 a


bull
 rally
 Hood's
 not
 going
 to
 make
 that


big
 of
 a
 move


but
 if
 we
 do
 Hood's
 going to
 be
 one
 of


the
 best
 performing
 stocks.
 So
 it's
 like


it
 really
 depends
 on
 where
 you
 think
 the


end
 of
 year
 kind
 of
 plays
 out.


I
 think
 that
 would
 be
 the
 most
 important


thing.
 Yeah.
 He
 also
 discussed
 staking.


I
 don't
 know
 why
 they're
 not
 staking


yet,
 but
 eventually
 when
 they
 do
 start


staking,
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 more


revenue
 coming
 in
 which
 will
 allow
 them


to
 buy
 more
 Ethereum.


But
 again,
 I
 don't
 even
 think
 it's
 about


the
 staking.
 They
 have
 the
 money
 to
 buy


ETH.
 It's
 ETH's
 not
 going
 up,
 right?


Like
 Tom
 Lee
 can
 raise
 $50
 billion


tomorrow
 to
 probably
 buy
 more
 Ethereum.


It's
 it's
 more
 so
 a
 question
 of
 like


Ethereum
 performing.


If
 that
 does
 happen,
 then
 I
 think


that'll
 be
 important.


admit
 they're
 just
 trying
 to
 get


investment
 banking
 fees
 from
 ESBED,


hence
 covering
 research.
 So,
 I
 would


agree
 with
 you
 if
 it
 was
 just
 a
 random


analyst,
 but
 not
 Devin
 Ryan.
 Devin
 Ryan


is
 one
 of
 the
 better
 analysts
 on
 Wall


Street.
 And
 so,
 yes,
 I
 agree.
 You
 know,


a
 lot
 of
 these
 investment
 firms
 just
 try


to
 collect
 management
 fees
 by
 or


research
 fees
 by
 by
 covering
 a
 name.


But
 I
 do
 think
 Devon
 Ryan,
 you
 know,


I've
 met
 him
 a
 couple
 times.
 I've


actually
 I
 followed
 his
 journey
 for
 the


past
 three
 years.
 I
 don't
 think
 he's
 the


type
 of
 guy
 to
 do
 that.
 Like
 I
 think
 I


think
 I
 mean
 dude
 I
 mean
 he
 literally
 he


told
 me
 that
 he
 got
 calls
 from
 hedge


funds
 when
 Robin
 Hood
 was
 $8
 telling
 him


to
 initiate
 a
 sell
 rating
 and
 he
 told


them
 just
 you
 know
 he
 gave
 them
 the


middle
 finger
 because
 he
 he
 knew
 at
 $8


like
 it
 was
 undervalued.


So
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 him
 initiating


it
 definitely
 gets
 my
 attention
 a
 bit


more
 than
 the
 other
 guys.
 Amazon
 right


there
 213.


That
 one's
 also
 red.
 My
 thoughts
 on
 the


PayPal
 $300
 trillion
 dollar
 stable
 coin


accident
 yesterday.
 Actually,
 we
 have


some
 coverage
 on
 that.
 I
 didn't
 even


fully
 get
 the
 story.
 So,
 let's
 get
 some


coverage
 here.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 mean,
 for


those
 that
 heard
 the
 story,
 it
 was
 kind


of
 wild
 to
 have
 a
 $300
 trillion
 mistake.


But,
 uh,
 that's
 kind
 of
 what
 happened.


>> Has
 the
 story
 for
 us.
 Can
 explain
 to
 us


what
 exactly
 happened
 here.
 McKenzie.


>> Hey,
 David.
 So,
 PayPal's
 big
 crypto
 bet


is
 its
 dollar
 peg
 stablecoin.
 It's


called
 PYUSD
 and
 as
 you
 said,
 it
 briefly


created
 $300
 trillion
 out
 of
 thin
 air


this
 week
 without
 any
 reserves
 to
 back


it.
 Now,
 there
 aren't
 even
 enough
 real


dollars
 in
 the
 system
 to
 cover
 that.
 It


was
 more
 than
 100
 times
 all
 the
 US
 cash


in
 circulation.
 Now,
 in
 terms
 of
 what


happened
 here,
 the
 mistake
 was
 made
 by


Paxos,
 which
 is
 PYUSD's
 issuer,
 during


an
 internal
 transfer.
 It
 showed
 up


publicly
 on
 the
 Ethereum
 blockchain
 and


then
 was
 reversed
 about
 20
 minutes
 later


after
 onchain
 observers
 flagged
 it.
 Now,


fat
 finger
 mistakes,
 they've
 happened


before.
 Tether
 once
 minted5
 billion


dollars
 by
 accident.


>> That's
 a
 $300
 trillion
 fat
 finger.


This
 is
 the
 first
 time
 I'm
 hearing
 the


story
 and
 getting
 any
 real
 coverage
 on


it.
 I
 mean,
 bro,
 like,
 as
 much
 as
 I


believe
 this
 whole
 stable
 coin
 thesis


makes
 sense,
 and
 I
 think
 it
 really
 will


be
 a
 tailwind
 for
 Ethereum,
 you
 can
 make


a
 $300
 trillion
 fat
 finger
 mistake.
 That


is


that's
 a
 little
 aggressive,
 bro.


>> And
 Croup
 mistakenly
 sent
 $81
 trillion


in
 a
 single
 transaction
 last
 year.
 But


this
 incident
 comes
 after
 Congress


passed
 the
 Genius
 Act,
 the
 first
 US


stablecoin
 law,
 which
 is
 raising


questions
 about
 why
 that
 framework


didn't
 prevent
 it.
 Analysts
 found
 that


PYUSD's
 smart
 contract
 was
 part
 of
 the


problem.
 It
 gave
 a
 single
 wallet


unlimited
 minting
 rights.
 That
 means
 no


rate
 limits,
 no
 multi-
 signature


protections.
 And
 as
 for
 the
 fallout,
 the


token
 briefly
 lost
 its
 dollar
 peg.
 One


major
 crypto
 lending
 platform
 froze
 all


PYUSD
 activity
 as
 a
 precaution
 and
 the


crypto
 market
 started
 to
 sell
 off.
 Now


that
 said,
 Paxos
 did
 flag
 that
 no


customer
 funds
 were
 affected.
 Still,
 New


York's
 financial
 regulator
 says
 that
 it


is
 reviewing
 the
 incident
 and
 is
 in


contact
 with
 both
 Paxos
 and
 PayPal.
 No


word
 from
 PayPal
 on
 this.
 Their
 shares


down
 5%
 since
 last
 week,
 though
 they
 are


turning
 positive
 after
 the
 open.
 Sarah,


>> growing
 pains,
 I
 guess.
 McKenzie,
 thank


you.
 Kenzie
 Sagalas,
 when
 we


>> Bro,
 can
 we
 can
 we
 all
 start
 a
 stable


coin
 and
 make
 We
 don't
 need
 300


trillion.
 We
 don't
 even
 need
 a
 trillion.


We
 don't
 even
 need
 a
 billion,
 bro.
 Can


we
 just
 mint
 like
 a
 couple
 million
 of


stable
 coin
 for
 us?
 Can
 we
 all
 do
 that?


Is
 that
 possible
 somehow?
 We
 don't
 need


to
 be
 that
 aggress.
 No
 one's
 going
 to


notice
 a
 couple
 million,
 right?
 300


trillion.
 Okay.
 100
 times
 the
 US
 dollars


in
 circulation.
 People
 won't
 notice


that.


couple
 million.
 No
 one's
 going
 to
 care


that
 much.
 Dude,
 the
 thing
 about
 300


trillion
 is
 like
 it
 makes
 money


literally
 worthless,
 right?
 Like
 if
 we


had
 300
 trillion
 in
 if
 you
 had
 that
 much


amount
 the
 actual
 circulation
 like
 the


dynamics
 of
 supply
 and
 demand
 completely


fall
 apart.


That's
 kind
 of
 wild,
 bro.
 They
 also
 said


City
 sent
 81
 trillion
 last
 year
 by


mistake.
 So,
 it's
 not
 just
 PayPal.
 It's


like
 companies
 have
 made
 these
 mistakes


before.
 This
 one
 was
 just
 really
 bad.


PayPal
 6641.
 Did
 PayPal
 tweet
 about


this?
 Did
 they
 respond?


I
 would
 wonder
 what
 the
 response
 would


be.
 Dude,
 they
 should
 make
 a
 joke
 out
 of


it.
 No,
 they're
 tweeting
 Christmas
 cards


with
 customer
 spotlights.


Okay,
 that's
 fine.
 They
 they
 they
 should


make
 a
 joke
 out
 of
 it.
 They
 like
 the


intern
 should
 just
 go
 on
 PayPal's


Twitter
 account
 and
 type
 in
 NBD.


No
 big
 deal.
 Or
 they
 should
 type
 in
 my


B.
 My
 bad.


Or
 oops.


Like,
 you
 gotta
 you
 gotta
 make
 this


funny
 somehow,
 bro.


That's
 wild.


Absolutely
 freaking
 wild.
 Oracle's
 down


7%.
 Oracle
 increased
 their
 RPO


aggressively.
 So,
 this
 one
 is
 getting


hit
 regardless
 of
 that.
 And
 then
 the
 S&P


is
 still
 barely
 up
 on
 the
 day.
 That's


it's
 it
 is
 just
 one
 of
 those
 days
 up
 and


down
 across
 the
 board.


Not
 really
 seeing
 that
 much
 of
 a


difference.
 We
 shocked
 the
 world.
 Yeah,


that's
 what
 they
 got
 to
 say.


Yeah.
 I
 look,
 it's
 not
 all
 PayPal's


fault.
 It's
 Paxel's
 I'm
 not
 even
 I'm
 not


even
 taking
 shots
 at
 PayPal.
 I
 just


think
 it's
 just
 crazy
 for
 that
 to
 even


be
 possible.
 A
 $300
 trillion
 mistake.


It
 is
 absolutely
 wild
 to
 see
 that


happening.


Oh
 boy.
 Amit,
 what
 is
 a
 good
 value
 dip


today?
 What
 are
 people
 buying?
 All


right,
 put
 in
 the
 chat,
 what's
 a
 good


value
 dip
 today?
 I
 mean,
 we
 talked
 to


Chris
 yesterday.
 He
 is
 on
 this
 Verizon


binge.
 He
 really
 thinks
 Verizon
 can


outperform
 next
 year.


Um,
 you
 know,
 UNH


obviously
 is
 one
 of
 the
 names
 that


people
 think
 is
 deep
 value.
 PayPal,


Salesforce,
 AT&T,
 Crown
 Castle,


Vodafone,
 American
 Tower.
 You
 got
 a
 lot


of
 those
 names
 that
 giving
 you
 yield


that
 people
 might
 be
 after.


I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 like
 Amazon,
 but
 who


knows,
 bro.
 Maybe
 Amazon
 has
 a
 crappy


earnings.
 This
 thing
 goes
 below
 200.
 If


it
 is,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 cry
 about
 it.


But,


no
 one
 buying
 it
 here
 should
 be
 afraid


of
 below
 200.
 You
 should
 be
 willing
 to


get
 excited
 for
 that.


But
 it
 could
 happen.


Um,
 BMR,
 SoFi,


I
 do
 think
 Tanner
 is
 right
 about
 SoFi.
 I


SoFi's
 going
 to
 crush.
 It's
 hard
 for
 me


to
 imagine
 SoFi
 doesn't
 cr
 I
 just
 don't


know if
 the
 macro
 is
 going to
 be
 good


enough.
 Dude,
 Sofi's
 earnings
 are
 in


nine
 days.
 Do do
 things
 change
 in
 nine


days?
 Do
 we
 get
 like
 a
 reversal
 of
 all


this
 sentiment
 decline
 and
 China
 stuff


in
 nine
 days?
 Maybe.


Maybe
 not.


By
 the
 way,
 Perplexity
 freaking


introduced
 language
 language
 stuff


yesterday,
 language
 features,
 and


Dualingo
 took
 a
 hit
 yesterday


based
 on
 that.
 So,
 Dualingo
 continuously


getting
 hit
 across
 the
 board
 with


different
 companies
 working
 on
 this


stuff.
 Oh,
 QBTZ
 should
 be
 pumping,


right?
 The
 Quantum
 short.
 Yeah,
 look
 at


that.
 16%
 on
 the
 day.


It's
 up
 basically


37%
 over
 the
 past
 two
 days.
 If
 you
 got


in
 right
 when
 DWave
 was
 about
 to
 start


dumping,
 you're
 up
 like
 40%
 in
 two
 days,


which
 is
 pretty
 cool.


But
 that
 one
 is
 green
 on
 the
 day.


Dolingo
 Dolingo
 is


slightly
 green.


Slightly
 green
 on
 the
 day.


Um,


IQ.
 That
 one
 stills
 down.
 SPY
 below
 660


again.


Goodness,
 bro.


Yeah.
 Again,
 the
 reason
 it's
 surprising


to
 me
 is
 because
 we
 really
 have
 not
 had


a
 day
 like
 this
 where
 you
 go
 green
 to


red,
 green
 to
 red,
 green
 to
 red
 these


many
 times.


I
 mean,
 usually
 it's
 a
 usually
 I
 end
 the


market
 open
 and
 we
 know
 the
 trend
 is


green
 and
 maybe
 something
 switches
 it
 by


the
 market
 close
 but
 like
 the
 trend
 is


green
 or
 I
 leave
 the
 market
 open
 and
 the


trend
 is
 red
 and
 it's
 like
 okay
 maybe


you
 know
 something
 good
 happens
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 day
 but
 it
 the
 it
 ends
 up


being
 red
 and
 more
 often
 than
 not
 over


the
 past
 five
 months
 the
 trend
 has
 been


green
 because
 we
 got
 a
 really
 good
 run


and
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is
 but
 a
 day
 like


today
 is
 just


completely
 up
 and
 down
 back
 and
 forth.


K
 View's
 up
 today.
 This
 is
 the
 Talenol.


Oh,
 wow.
 They're
 up
 8%.
 Talenol
 parent


company.


I
 guess
 people
 are
 going
 long
 the
 tism


today.


I
 guess
 that's
 what's
 happening.


Yeah.
 Core
 down
 147
 to
 131.


Tesla's
 earnings
 next
 week
 week
 will


lift
 the
 market.
 Dude,
 I
 don't
 know if


Tesla's
 earnings
 are
 going
 to
 do
 that.


I
 feel
 like
 Tesla
 earnings
 are
 going to


be
 the
 one
 that
 we
 have
 to
 try
 to


survive.


Like
 Tesla
 will
 have
 an
 okay
 earnings


because
 of
 the
 deliveries,


but
 we
 I
 mean
 again,
 this
 is
 not
 me


saying
 it.
 Elon
 has
 guided
 until
 3
 Q26.


Don't
 expect
 growth.
 For
 the
 past
 four


quarters,
 Tesla's
 had
 negative
 growth


across
 the
 board.
 I
 don't
 know if
 that


changes
 this
 quarter.
 I
 think
 it's
 still


going
 to
 be
 pretty
 ugly,


but
 but
 I
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 going


to
 be
 ugly
 enough
 to
 like
 tank
 the


market.
 Realistically,
 dude,
 yeah,


Tesla's
 got
 to
 do
 well,
 but
 the
 other


six
 are
 the
 ones
 that
 matter
 to
 keep
 the


bull
 market
 going.
 I
 mean,
 unless
 Tesla


really
 surprises
 to
 the
 upside,
 Amazon,


Meta,
 Google,
 the
 ones
 that
 are
 in
 this


AI
 capex,
 like
 that's
 the
 stuff
 that


really
 matters.
 It's
 not
 going
 to
 be


Tesla.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 we
 already


know
 them.
 It
 just
 might
 not
 be
 the


best.


Um,


yeah,
 I
 think
 Elon
 is
 more
 concerned


about
 the
 shareholder
 meeting
 even
 more


than
 earnings
 right
 now.
 Now,
 granted,


he
 might
 want
 to
 give
 a
 good
 earnings.


Like,
 look,
 the
 stock
 down
 20%
 is
 not


going
 to
 be
 fun
 going
 into
 that


earnings,
 the
 shareholder
 vote.
 So,
 they


might
 be
 incentivized
 to
 give
 a
 really


good
 earnings,
 but
 then
 again,
 they
 also


can't
 control
 it.
 Like


we
 know
 the
 cars
 they
 sold
 and
 it's
 just


not
 as
 much
 as
 they
 did
 last
 year.


659
 on
 the
 S&P


BMR.
 Are
 we
 below
 48?


No.
 4880.


4880.


Yeah.
 Look,
 Tesla
 was
 up
 last
 earnings,


but
 then
 it
 tanked
 the
 day
 after
 or
 the


week
 after.
 I
 mean,
 like


I
 don't
 know,
 dude.


I'm
 just
 listening
 to
 what
 Elon
 said.
 If


you
 go
 listen
 to
 the
 earnings
 call


again,
 Elon
 explicitly
 said
 by
 the


second
 half
 of
 next
 year,
 we
 are
 not


going
 to
 show
 growth.
 So
 he
 was
 just


telling
 people
 just
 you
 got
 to
 give
 us


time,
 which
 is
 reasonable,
 right?
 Like
 I


mean
 like
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 you
 got


to
 give
 them
 some
 time
 to
 figure
 out
 a


lot
 of
 what
 they're
 doing.
 Rates
 will


come
 down
 by
 then.
 That's
 going to
 help


car
 sales
 also.


But
 I
 wouldn't
 have
 the
 highest


expectations
 for
 Tessy.


Is
 BMR
 buying
 ETH
 this
 weekend?
 Uh,


there
 were
 some
 accounts
 yesterday


showing
 that
 BMR
 probably
 already
 bought


ETH
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 days.
 I
 mean,
 I


would
 imagine
 they
 buy
 more.


Basically
 getting
 the
 same
 price
 you
 got


last
 week
 on
 on
 Sunday.


VG,
 how's
 that
 one
 doing?


8.93.
 Is
 Next
 still
 up
 9%.


No,
 it
 lost
 half
 of
 it.
 Up
 4%.


Growth
 in
 Roboaxi.
 Well,
 Robo
 Taxi
 is


not
 going
 to
 really
 show
 anything.
 They


only
 unveiled
 it
 in
 Austin


and
 they
 didn't
 charge
 a
 lot
 of
 money


per
 drive,
 right?


Like
 they
 charged
 like
 $4.20
 per
 ride.


I
 don't
 think
 Rootax
 is
 going
 to
 show


anything.


Like
 I
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 what
 there
 is


to
 be
 outside
 energy
 will
 grow,
 but


energy
 doesn't
 contribute
 that
 much
 to


the
 bottom
 line.


I
 don't
 know.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 other


hyperscalers
 really
 are
 going
 to
 matter.


Amazon
 right
 here
 212.
 That
 one's
 down


1%.


Tom
 Lee
 tweeted
 about
 Ethereum.


Um


he
 says
 this
 is
 very
 constructive
 for


ETH.
 He's
 quoting
 a
 chart
 that
 says
 at


this
 point
 only
 levered
 ETH
 positions


are
 the
 shorts.


I
 mean
 like
 yeah
 that's
 true.
 If
 you're


super
 levered
 ETH
 short,


unless
 ETH
 has
 a
 massive


a
 massive
 move
 down,
 we're
 talking


about,
 you
 know,
 32
 3,300


should
 be
 hopefully
 a
 sign
 of
 somewhat


of
 a
 bottom,
 but


I
 guess
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see.
 Um,


okay,
 let's
 get
 some
 coverage
 right


here.
 We
 got
 Bent
 update
 on
 him
 speaking


uh


with
 China
 today


>> talking
 about
 for
 the
 last
 couple
 hours.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 could
 be
 a
 major


breakthrough
 in
 these
 discussions


between
 US
 and
 China
 on
 their
 trade


talks
 learning
 today
 as
 CNBC
 did
 that


Besson
 is
 going
 to
 speak
 with
 his


Chinese
 counterpart
 Vice
 Premier
 Hi
 Fong


on
 the
 phone
 today.
 Again,
 this
 could


represent
 a
 breakthrough
 after
 we've


seen
 some
 tension
 uh
 between
 the
 back


and
 forth
 over
 the
 rare
 earths.
 Of


course,
 Trump
 saying
 last
 week


threatening
 that
 100%
 increase
 in


tariffs.
 Now,
 we
 don't
 know
 exactly
 when


this
 call
 is
 going
 to
 take
 place,
 nor
 do


we
 know
 exactly
 what
 the
 topic
 is
 going


to
 be,
 but
 it's
 certainly
 a
 step
 forward


because
 Bessant
 wouldn't
 say
 earlier


this
 week
 whether
 he
 would
 speak
 with


his
 Chinese
 counterpart.
 So,
 that
 really


does
 make
 the
 fact
 that
 this
 call
 is


going
 to
 happen
 notable.
 We'll
 be


keeping
 an
 ear
 out
 for
 any
 sort
 of


readout
 from
 that
 call
 or
 next
 steps


when
 it
 comes
 to
 these
 negotiations,


guys.


>> So,
 what
 what
 are
 the
 potential
 next


steps?
 We
 haven't
 heard
 any
 I
 mean,


we've
 it
 does
 seem
 like
 the
 Shei
 Trump


meeting
 is
 scheduled
 on
 the
 calendar
 and


and
 it
 feels
 like
 they
 want
 to
 keep


that.


>> Sarah,
 we
 haven't
 really
 heard
 anything


at
 least
 for
 a
 while
 otherwise.
 is
 I


know
 Trump
 s
 for
 a
 moment
 floated
 the


idea
 that
 that
 might
 not
 happen,
 but


then
 it
 seemed
 like
 there
 was
 pretty


quickly
 a
 pivot
 back
 to
 saying
 that
 that


meeting
 was
 still
 going
 to
 be
 in
 place.


As
 far
 as
 we
 know,
 it's
 still
 on.
 I


mean,
 I
 think
 it's
 reasonable
 to
 kind
 of


view
 anything
 in
 the
 leadup
 to
 that


conversation
 as
 setting
 the
 stage,


laying
 the
 groundwork
 for
 a
 potential


agreement
 to
 come
 out
 of
 that
 meeting.


Uh
 we
 know
 that
 this
 is
 certainly
 not


the
 first
 time
 that
 Bessant
 and
 his


Chinese
 counterpart
 have
 met.
 We
 know


that
 they
 met
 earlier
 this
 year,
 uh,


having
 that
 they've
 been
 a
 part
 of
 these


conversations.
 Uh,
 but
 at
 this
 point,
 I


think
 we're
 waiting
 to
 see
 exactly


what's
 going
 to
 come
 and
 if
 there's


going
 to
 be
 some
 sort
 of
 resolution
 here


when
 it
 comes
 to
 rare
 earths
 as
 well
 as


other
 aspects
 of
 this
 trade
 negotiation.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much,
 Emily
 Wilkins.
 I


think
 the
 other
 takeaway
 this


>> All
 right,
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 That
 is


what
 we
 got
 for
 today.
 Looks
 like
 China


descent
 will
 have
 that
 meeting.
 And


hopefully
 we
 get
 something
 constructive


from
 that.
 Stocks
 are
 flat.
 I
 mean,


you're
 not
 getting
 a
 trend
 one
 way
 or


the
 other.
 So,
 when
 we
 get
 back
 on
 the


market
 close,
 we'll
 kind
 of
 see
 how
 this


ends
 up
 looking
 like.


But
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 I
 think
 the


summary
 of
 this
 here
 is


uh
 regional
 banking
 stuff
 not
 that
 big


of
 an
 issue.


China
 stuff
 is
 an
 issue.
 and
 Trump


saying
 that,
 you
 know,
 they're
 going
 to


get
 rid
 of
 the
 100%
 tariff
 thing
 this


morning
 made
 things
 not
 as
 bad
 as
 it
 was


at
 2
 a.m.
 The
 sent
 China
 discussion


hopefully
 much
 more
 optimistic
 for
 the


markets
 if
 we
 get
 some
 good
 news
 from


that.
 And
 then
 finally,
 I
 would
 say
 this


is
 October
 volatility
 on
 a
 Friday
 where


you
 got
 options
 expiring
 and
 you
 the


market's
 really
 exhausted
 and
 a
 lot
 of


these
 names
 that
 are
 either
 going
 flat


or
 red
 or
 slightly
 red
 or
 slightly
 green


is
 just
 endemic
 of
 the
 idea
 that
 markets


are
 tired
 and
 they
 might
 want
 to
 take
 a


breather


and
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 Now,


some
 of
 the
 more
 hardcore
 names
 like
 a


BMR
 are
 not
 are
 not
 flat
 because
 ETH
 is


getting
 hit,
 but
 then
 you
 have
 an
 AMD


which
 look
 1%
 is
 not
 flat,
 but
 I
 mean


it's
 it's
 it's
 1%,
 right?
 After
 a
 40%


run,
 you
 you
 can't
 get
 too
 upset
 about


that.


So,
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 I
 think


that
 is
 what
 we've
 got
 for
 today
 and


we'll
 be
 back
 at
 3:45
 to
 see
 what
 we
 got


going
 on.


Uh
 Andy,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Keep


draining
 the
 threes,
 bro.
 Shout
 out
 to


the
 chat.
 Andy,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super


chat
 and
 thank
 you
 for


being
 here
 as
 well.
 Matt,
 thanks
 for
 the


$10
 super
 chat.
 VIX
 index
 was
 below
 23


77%
 of
 the
 days.
 This
 might
 be
 good
 to


buy
 puts
 on
 the
 VIX.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 look,


it's
 worked
 out.
 If
 you
 bought
 it
 at


when
 it
 was
 25
 right
 now,
 yeah,
 2360.
 I


mean,
 it
 is
 down
 6%
 on
 the
 day.
 If
 that


one
 continues
 to
 go
 down,
 puts
 in
 the


VIX
 would
 not
 be
 bad.
 But
 if
 this
 kind


of
 normalizes
 at
 this
 level
 above
 20,


might
 not
 be
 the
 best
 opportunity
 right


here.
 So,
 we're
 going to
 have
 to
 see


as
 we
 get
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.


All
 right,
 there
 you
 go.
 That's
 what
 we


got.
 You
 know,
 to
 be
 honest,
 might
 just


not
 be
 worth
 looking
 at
 the
 portfol


portfolio
 today,
 keeping
 up
 with
 the


markets.
 It
 looks
 like
 it's
 going
 to
 be


flat
 throughout
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 day.


We'll
 be
 back
 on
 the
 close.
 We'll
 have


Steve
 come
 on.
 We'll
 see


what
 is
 going
 on
 across
 the
 board,
 but


as
 of
 now,
 it's
 it's
 just
 not
 much
 that


we
 can
 really
 get
 that
 deep
 into.


And
 we're
 just
 not
 getting
 the
 price


action
 to
 kind
 of
 resemble
 that
 either.


M,
 why
 are
 we
 selling
 off
 so
 much?
 Well,


we're
 not
 actually.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 the


S&P
 right
 there
 is
 flat.


at
 4
 am
 we
 were
 selling
 off
 a
 lot
 and
 I


still
 don't
 have
 an
 answer
 for
 that
 but


Trump
 calmed
 everyone
 down
 with
 the


China
 comment
 so
 I
 guess
 China
 was
 the


reason
 but


you
 know
 now
 we're
 just
 kind
 of


staying
 where
 we
 are
 right
 here


Benny
 says
 honestly
 not
 a
 bad
 day
 at
 all


zoom
 out
 been
 cooking
 for
 a
 long
 time


yeah
 and
 look
 I
 don't
 mean
 to
 be
 gloomy


here
 but
 like
 obviously
 it
 it
 sucks
 for


everybody
 seeing
 not
 seeing
 the
 recovery


that
 we
 saw
 on
 remember
 we
 were
 at
 670


on
 Monday
 on
 the
 S&P
 we
 were
 recovering


a
 lot
 of
 that
 Friday
 stuff
 and
 then
 kind


of
 just
 went
 the
 opposite
 direction.


However,
 the
 bright
 side
 of
 all
 this
 is


that
 it
 is
 really
 healthy
 to
 see
 a
 lot


of
 the
 nonsense
 that
 was
 running
 over


the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 like
 get
 flushed


out.
 Unfortunately,
 everything
 else
 has


to
 get
 flushed
 out
 with
 it.
 Those
 stocks


are
 getting
 like,
 you
 know,
 if
 Amazon's


down
 3%,
 you
 got
 a
 quantum
 name
 that's


down
 15%.
 So,
 that's
 that
 that
 stuff


just
 has
 to
 happen.
 And
 hopefully
 it


makes
 the
 markets
 a
 bit
 healthier,
 dude.


I
 think
 all
 of
 us
 were
 feeling
 uneasy


over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 with
 the
 meme


stock
 ETF
 and
 you
 know
 5x
 leverage
 ETFs


that
 are
 being
 introduced
 to
 the
 market.


Uh
 massive
 call
 volume
 on
 days
 where
 you


know
 you
 probably
 shouldn't
 be
 getting


people
 buying
 that
 many
 calls.
 Like
 in


general
 getting
 a
 breather
 as
 much
 as
 it


hurts
 the
 portfolio
 short
 term
 is
 just


short-term
 pain
 for
 long-term
 gain


which
 is
 probably
 the
 the
 best
 way
 to


kind
 of
 navigate
 it.


All
 right,
 that's
 it.
 That
 is
 it
 for
 me.


We'll
 be
 back
 on
 the
 close.
 We'll
 see


what
 we
 got
 going
 on.
 Uh,
 real
 quick,


first
 of
 all,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 thank


everybody
 for
 subscribing
 to
 the


Substack.
 The
 first
 two
 deep
 dives
 will


be
 out
 today.
 The
 first
 two
 deep
 dives


will
 be
 out
 today.
 Uh,
 I
 don't
 even
 know


how
 Substack
 works,
 but
 uh,
 they
 have


these
 ranks
 and
 these
 categories,
 and


we're
 number
 one
 in
 the
 new
 best
 seller


on
 Substack,
 and
 we're
 number
 two
 in


business,
 which
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 I


didn't
 even
 know
 Substack
 does
 something


like
 that.
 So,
 I
 am
 very
 very
 humbled


for
 the
 people
 that
 are
 subscribing
 to


it
 and
 it
 means
 a
 lot.
 Uh,
 so
 I'll
 put


the
 link
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat
 for


those
 that
 want
 to


subscribe.


Um,
 and
 it's
 free.
 There's
 no
 payw
 wall.


A
 bunch
 of
 you
 guys
 have
 pledged
 like
 a


donation
 per
 year,
 and
 I
 deeply


appreciate
 that.
 That
 is
 not
 required.


None
 of
 the
 content
 will
 ever
 need
 uh


money
 to
 be
 able
 to
 access
 the
 the
 the


research.


So,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 subscribe,
 you
 can


subscribe.
 It'll
 probably
 be
 out
 around


like
 7
 PM
 tonight,
 two
 deep
 dives.


Um,


and
 we'll
 be
 doing
 a
 lot
 more
 deep
 dives


every
 single
 month.
 But
 I
 am
 enjoying


the
 process.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 taken
 me
 a


month
 to
 write
 these
 two
 deep
 dives.
 And


the
 the
 written
 research
 is
 not
 easy,


but
 it
 really
 does
 feel
 fun
 like
 when


you
 put
 everything
 together
 and
 then
 put


it
 out
 into
 one
 thing.
 Like
 it's
 just


something
 you
 can
 feel
 a
 little bit


proud
 of
 just
 like
 you
 know
 saying
 I


wrote
 this
 and
 it's
 there
 and
 like
 you


know
 people
 can
 then
 read
 it
 and
 and


Substack
 is
 a
 platform
 where
 people


legit
 read
 so
 people
 are
 actually


reading
 every
 word.
 It's
 different
 than


audio
 and
 video


and
 so
 yeah
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 it's
 pretty


pretty
 cool.
 Is
 Trump
 live
 right
 now?


There's
 no
 way
 Trump
 is
 live,
 bro.


There's
 no
 freaking
 way
 Trump
 is
 live.


Hold
 on.
 Is
 he
 actually
 live?


What
 is
 he
 legit
 live?


I
 think
 he's
 live.
 I'm
 not
 getting
 the


feed
 of
 it
 though.


Content
 in
 chief.
 That
 is
 correct.
 Hold


on.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 there's
 a
 different


one.


Wait,
 he's
 live.
 Is
 he
 having
 a
 cabinet


meeting
 today?


Uh,
 hold
 on,
 hold
 on,
 hold
 on.


Uh,


dude,
 I
 don't
 see
 I
 don't
 see
 the
 feed


and
 no
 one's
 the
 business
 channels


aren't
 covering
 it.


So,
 where
 would
 he
 be
 live
 at?
 The
 White


House
 is
 not
 live
 either.


President
 Trump
 address.
 Is
 this
 it?


Some
 of
 these
 feeds
 are
 playing
 old
 live


streams.


Is
 this
 one
 a
 real


11:30?
 He'll
 be
 Oh,
 11:30.
 Oh,
 Zalinski


meeting
 today.
 I
 forgot.


Oh,
 [ __ ]
 I
 forgot.
 You're
 right.
 Oh,


boy.
 All right.
 Well,
 we'll
 see
 what


happens
 with
 that.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 So,
 he


will
 be
 live.


It's
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 happen
 at


11:30.
 All right.
 We'll
 cover
 that
 on


the
 close,
 but
 yeah,
 we'll
 get
 Zalinsky.


That'll
 be
 in
 20
 minutes.
 All right.


Yeah,
 we'll
 cover
 that
 on
 the
 close
 and


we'll
 see
 what
 happens
 from
 there.
 So,


we'll
 see
 what
 we've
 got
 going
 on.


All right.
 Yeah,
 strap
 in
 on
 that
 one.


That's
 going
 to
 be


again,
 Trump
 said
 that
 he
 uh
 he
 had
 a


conversation
 with
 Putin
 yesterday
 and
 he


was
 joking
 about
 sending
 Putin
 tomahawk


missiles
 and
 all
 this
 stuff.
 And
 so,
 I


mean,
 we're
 gonna
 see
 what
 the
 tone
 is


in
 the
 context
 of


of
 uh
 of
 Zillinsky.
 This
 is
 this
 is
 the


clip
 from
 yesterday
 when
 Trump
 was


talking
 about
 this.


>> Putin
 tried
 to
 dissuade
 you
 from
 selling


tomahawk
 missiles.


>> Well,
 of
 course.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 he's


going
 to
 say?
 Please
 sell
 tomahawks.


>> Is
 he
 going
 to
 say
 please
 sell
 those


tomahawks?
 I
 really
 appreciate
 it.


I
 did
 actually
 say,
 "Would
 you
 mind
 if
 I


gave
 a
 couple
 of
 thousand
 tomahawks
 to


your
 opposition?"
 I
 did
 say
 that
 to
 him.


I
 said
 it
 just
 that
 way.


He
 didn't
 like
 the
 idea.
 He
 really


didn't
 like
 the
 idea.
 No,
 I
 said
 it
 that


that
 way.
 Uh
 you
 have
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit


lighthearted
 sometimes,
 but
 uh
 no,
 he


doesn't
 want
 Tomahawk
 is
 a
 vicious


weapon.
 It's
 a
 vicious
 offensive,


incredibly
 destructive
 weapon.
 Nobody


wants
 Tom.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 based
 on
 that


tone
 with
 the
 meeting
 with
 Putin


yesterday,
 I
 wonder
 what
 they're
 going


to
 say
 with
 uh
 with
 Zillinsky,


but
 we'll
 cover
 that
 in
 the
 market
 close


and
 see
 what
 we
 got
 going
 on
 there.


All right,
 that's
 it
 for
 me.
 Thank
 you


everybody.
 Again,
 if
 you
 want
 to


subscribe
 to
 the
 Substack,
 two
 deep


dives
 will
 be
 out
 to
 start
 off
 the


Substack
 journey
 later
 tonight.
 Thank


you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Deeply


appreciate
 it.
 I
 will
 be
 back
 on
 the


market
 open.
 Hopefully
 we
 stay
 flat
 to


end
 out
 the
 day
 and
 then
 we'll
 kind
 of


see
 how
 this
 turns
 out
 as
 we
 get
 to
 the


end
 of
 the
 day.
 Word
 of
 the
 day.
 You're


right.
 We
 forgot
 that.


How
 do
 you
 say
 this
 word,
 bro?
 What
 is


this
 word
 of
 the
 day?


SM
 plastic.


>> SM
 plastic.


>> Okay,
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 an
 easy
 word,
 but


capable
 of
 shaping
 diverse
 elements
 or


concepts
 into
 a
 unified
 hole.


I
 have
 never
 heard
 anyone
 who's
 ever


used
 this
 word
 before,
 bro.
 SM
 plastic


capable
 of
 shaping
 diverse
 elements
 or


concepts
 into
 I
 think
 it's
 basically


saying
 you're
 you're
 trying
 to
 piece


together
 different
 elements
 of
 a
 concept


and
 bring
 it
 all
 into
 one
 story,


but
 I've
 never
 heard
 of
 this
 word
 being


described
 to
 use
 that.


Yeah,
 I
 guess
 I
 try
 to
 be
 SM
 plastic


every
 market
 open,
 market
 closed.
 But


then
 Trump
 tweets
 something
 and
 it's


hard
 to
 bring
 all
 the
 concepts
 together


into
 a
 unified
 story
 because
 there's


nothing
 unified
 about
 it
 when
 he
 says


something.


So,
 it's
 hard
 to
 do
 that
 every
 single


day.
 All right,
 that's
 it.
 Thank


everybody.
 Appreciate
 it.
 I'll
 see
 you


guys
 on
 the
 market
 close.
 Bye
 everybody.


Have
 a
 good
 one.
