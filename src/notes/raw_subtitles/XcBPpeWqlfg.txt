Think
 back
 to
 the
 year


1999


2000
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Something


very
 interesting
 was


happening.
 The.com
 bubble


burst.
 I
 was
 a
 young
 assistant
 professor


teaching
 at
 a
 business
 school,
 mainly


MBA
 students,
 many
 of
 whom
 were


expecting
 to
 enter
 a
 career
 into
 an


industry
 where
 they
 would
 get
 to
 explore


the
 role
 of
 technology
 and
 this
 new.com


universe.
 And
 all
 of
 that
 goes
 by
 the


wayside.
 The
 following
 year,
 Enron


collapses.
 And
 then
 you
 see
 a
 series
 of


CEOs
 trapesed
 across
 the
 news
 media,


either
 in
 handcuffs
 or
 headed
 to
 court


because
 there
 was
 just
 a
 collapse
 of
 the


business
 sector
 in
 the
 United
 States.


As
 a
 business
 school
 professor,
 looking


out
 at
 the
 scores
 of
 young


impressionable
 minds
 who
 all
 thought


they
 were
 going
 to
 enter
 this
 industry,


I
 was
 really
 grappling
 with
 what
 do
 I


say
 to
 these
 young
 people?
 How
 do
 I


convey
 that
 to
 them
 that
 business


actually
 is
 and
 can
 be
 a
 force
 for
 good


when
 everything
 they
 see
 is
 that


business
 is
 bad,
 that
 leadership
 is
 bad,


that
 something
 in
 the
 system
 is
 broken?


Well,
 fortunately
 for
 me,
 that
 led
 to
 an


interest
 in
 understanding
 organizational


crises,
 but
 not
 so
 much
 because
 I
 was


curious
 about
 what
 goes
 wrong.
 I
 really


wanted
 to
 answer
 the
 question,
 how
 do


those
 companies
 that
 come
 out
 of


organization
 that
 come
 out
 of
 crisis,


how
 do
 they
 do
 that?
 How
 do
 they


succeed?
 What
 are
 the
 leadership


characteristics
 that
 are
 necessary
 to


drive
 organizations
 through
 the
 most


tumultuous
 times?


So
 that
 led
 to
 decades
 of
 research
 for


me
 and
 studying
 organizational


leadership,
 organizational
 culture,


particularly
 in
 times
 of
 crisis.
 So
 I


want
 to
 share
 with
 you
 a
 little
 bit


about
 what
 I've
 learned.
 The
 first
 thing


I've
 learned
 is
 that
 we
 have
 to
 be


really
 clear
 about
 what
 we
 mean
 by
 a


crisis.
 Raise
 your
 hand
 if
 you
 have
 said


or
 have
 heard
 people
 say
 as
 they
 go
 into


the
 office,
 "Well,
 what
 crisis
 are
 we


managing
 today?
 Anyone
 hear
 that?
 Anyone


said


that?
 How
 many
 fires
 do
 we
 have
 to
 put


out
 this
 week?
 Right?
 We
 use
 this


language
 as
 if
 everyday
 problems
 that


are


inconveniences
 are
 actually


crises.
 And
 when
 we
 do
 that,
 we
 make


impotent
 our
 the
 ability
 of
 our


workforce
 to
 actually
 manage
 something


that
 is


significant.
 So
 what
 is
 significant?
 A


real
 crisis
 is
 any
 negative
 event
 that


has
 the
 potential
 to
 threaten
 an


organization's
 financial
 well-being,


reputation,
 or


legitimacy.
 I
 think
 it's
 pretty
 safe
 to


say
 that
 what
 we're
 experiencing
 now,


the
 tumult
 across
 the
 world,
 there
 are


real
 crises
 that
 people
 are
 dealing


with.
 That
 is
 what
 we
 should
 be
 focused


on.
 How
 do
 we
 help
 people
 and
 leaders


operate
 in
 these
 kind
 of
 environments?


Not
 the
 daily
 barrage
 of
 inconveniences


that
 we'd
 rather
 not
 deal


with.
 But
 we
 also
 talk
 about
 crisis
 as


if
 all
 crises
 are
 the
 same.
 And
 I
 want


to
 have
 you
 think
 about
 two
 different


types
 of
 crises.
 One
 is
 well,
 we
 talked


about
 the
 financial
 well-being,
 talked


about
 reputational


risks.
 Look


familiar?
 And
 I've
 talked
 about
 the


legitimacy.
 We're
 going
 to
 go
 into
 a


little
 more
 detail
 on
 all
 of
 these
 in


just
 a


moment.
 Two
 different
 types
 of


crises.
 Sudden
 crises
 and
 smoldering


crises.
 Sudden


crisis
 are
 those
 kinds
 of
 events
 that


are
 typically
 externally
 imposed
 on
 an


organization.
 something
 happens
 to
 the


company
 that
 for
 the
 most
 part
 you
 have


very
 little
 responsibility
 for
 or


control
 over.
 Natural
 disasters,
 a


terrorist
 attack,
 CEO
 death,
 etc.
 These


are
 sudden
 events
 that
 happen
 that
 sort


of
 throw
 you


offkilter.
 How
 many
 of
 you
 spend
 your


time
 thinking
 and
 planning
 for
 a
 sudden


crisis?
 Raise
 your


hand.
 Handful.
 Okay,
 another
 type
 of


crisis,
 smoldering
 crisis.
 Smoldering


crisis
 are
 those
 things
 that
 start
 out


small
 and
 internal
 in
 the
 organization


that
 should
 be
 spotted
 as
 a
 problem,
 but


oftentimes
 go
 ignored
 because
 we
 think,


"Oh,
 that's
 a
 little
 thing.
 It
 it
 will


be
 fine."
 But
 because
 we've
 ignored
 it,


it
 tends
 to
 grow
 and
 fester
 and
 over


time
 can
 erupt
 into
 something
 more


significant.


You
 see
 on
 the
 screen
 examples
 of
 sudden


of
 smoldering
 crises,
 product
 defects,


labor
 disputes,
 safety
 violations,
 class


action
 lawsuits.
 All
 of
 these
 things
 are


signals
 that
 something
 is
 not
 right
 in


the


organization.
 How
 many
 of
 you
 spend
 your


time
 planning
 for
 these


events?
 For
 those
 of
 you
 on
 the
 screen,


very
 few
 hands
 are
 raised,
 right?
 We


plan
 largely
 for
 the
 salacious
 events,


those
 things
 like
 a
 natural
 disaster.
 We


don't
 often
 prepare
 ourselves
 as
 leaders


or
 our
 organizations
 for
 these
 kinds
 of


events.
 Which
 are
 you
 more
 likely
 to


encounter?
 A
 sudden
 event
 or
 a


smoldering


event?
 A
 smoldering
 event?
 Right?
 These


are
 much
 more
 common
 place
 in


organizations.


The
 good
 news
 is
 that
 we
 as
 executives,


as
 leaders,
 have
 a
 bias
 for
 action.
 So


when
 something
 happens,
 we
 immediately


want
 to
 go
 into
 containment
 mode.
 We


want
 to
 engage
 in
 damage


control.
 Makes
 perfect
 sense.
 But
 I


would
 argue
 that
 containment
 and
 damage


control
 is
 a
 necessary
 but


insufficient
 aspect
 of
 leadership


particularly
 in
 times
 of
 crisis.


That's
 all
 we
 focus
 on.
 We're
 not


creating
 a
 culture
 of
 a
 workforce
 that


understands
 and
 knows
 how
 to
 deal
 across


the
 crisis
 landscape
 which
 happens


before
 the
 event
 happens,
 not
 just
 once


something
 happens
 and
 you
 have
 to
 go


into
 response
 mode.
 So
 I
 want
 to
 spend
 a


little
 bit
 of
 time
 talking
 about
 what


are
 the
 characteristics,
 what
 are
 the


actions
 that
 leaders
 should
 be
 engaged


in
 to
 build
 a
 culture
 of
 resiliency
 in


order
 to
 respond
 to
 crisis.
 So,
 first
 is


paying
 attention
 to
 the


signals
 in
 your


environment.
 Those
 signals
 could
 be
 uh


information
 that
 you're
 receiving
 from


employees,
 could
 be
 insights
 that
 you're


receiving
 from
 your
 customers
 or


clients,
 it
 could
 be
 feedback
 going
 on


in
 the
 industry,
 it
 could
 be
 something


that's
 happened
 to
 a


competitor.
 Right?
 All
 of
 these
 are


pieces
 of
 information
 that
 leaders


should
 be
 paying
 attention
 to,


recognizing
 that
 what's
 happening
 in
 the


environment
 could
 just
 as
 easily
 happen


to
 their
 organization.
 So,
 paying


attention
 to
 the
 signals.
 Next,
 once
 you


have
 that
 information,
 what
 do
 you
 do


with
 it?
 Great
 leaders
 actually
 take
 the


time
 to
 work
 with
 their
 teams
 to
 prepare


for
 some
 of
 those
 eventualities.
 Of


course,
 we
 can
 never
 identify
 or
 predict


or
 prepare
 for
 everything
 that
 could


possibly
 go
 wrong.
 But
 getting
 into
 the


practice
 of
 even
 thinking
 about
 one


possibility
 or
 recognizing
 some
 signal


that
 is
 happening
 within
 your
 industry


and
 going
 through
 the
 exercise
 with
 your


teams,
 what
 would
 we
 do
 if
 it's
 the


scenario
 planning?
 It's
 the
 preparation


and
 the
 planning
 for
 something
 that
 goes


wrong.
 By
 doing
 that,
 you're
 building
 m


muscle,
 leadership
 muscle,
 crisis


leadership
 muscle,
 so
 that
 when


something
 does
 happen,
 you've
 already


got
 some
 foundation
 from
 which
 to
 to


start.
 Now,
 inevitably,
 you
 will
 face,


you
 will
 have
 some
 kind
 of
 experience


that
 you'd
 rather
 not,
 some
 crisis.
 And


at
 that
 point,
 you
 do
 need
 to
 go
 into


response
 mode.
 You
 need
 to
 think
 about


damage
 control.
 How
 do
 I
 manage
 this


impression?
 How
 do
 I
 deal
 with
 how
 do
 I


stop
 the
 bleeding
 of
 what's
 happening
 in


this
 moment?
 That's
 the
 stuff
 we're


generally
 already
 really
 good


at.
 But
 what
 happens
 after
 we
 engage
 in


our
 recovery
 practice
 or
 in
 our
 our


containment


practices,
 we
 wipe
 our
 brow
 and
 we


think,
 "Glad
 done.
 Now
 we
 can
 get
 back


to
 business
 as
 usual.
 Now
 we
 can
 get


back
 to
 normal.


But
 here's
 the
 problem.
 If
 this
 were
 a


crisis
 that
 only
 happened
 to
 your


company
 and
 you
 exist
 in
 a
 broader


industry,
 what
 is
 everybody
 else
 doing


while
 you
 were
 managing
 your


crisis?
 They
 were
 continuing
 with
 their


strategic
 objectives.
 So
 if
 your
 goal


post
 crisis
 is
 to
 get
 back
 to


normal,
 chances
 are
 you're
 going
 to
 come


out
 of
 that
 crisis
 many
 more
 steps


behind
 your
 peers
 who
 were
 able
 to


leverage
 that
 time
 to
 continue
 to


advance
 their


strategy.
 So
 the
 focus
 around


containment,
 containment
 and
 damage


control
 isn't
 about
 getting
 back
 to


normal.
 It's
 about
 thinking
 where
 can
 we


go
 from
 here?


What
 is
 the
 phoenix
 rising
 from
 the


ashes
 after


this
 mess
 that
 we've
 been
 a
 part
 of?


Asking
 yourself,
 asking
 your
 teams
 those


questions.
 How
 do
 we


recover
 from
 this
 circumstance
 in
 a
 way


that
 will
 position
 us
 to
 be
 better,
 to


be
 stronger,
 to
 be


resilient?


Right?
 And
 then


lastly,
 something
 we've
 been
 talking


about
 all
 afternoon,


learning.
 The
 best
 leaders
 and
 therefore


the
 best
 companies
 are
 those
 that
 take


these
 moments
 of
 crisis,
 of
 tumult,
 of


extreme
 change
 and
 recognize
 how
 do
 we


engage
 in
 an
 activity
 of
 reflection.
 In


the
 military,
 they
 call
 it
 the


afteraction
 review.
 How
 do
 we
 go
 through


this
 methodical
 process
 to
 understand


what
 lessons
 we
 should
 take
 from
 what


we've
 just
 experienced?
 What
 role
 did
 we


play
 in
 creating
 this


crisis?
 What
 ways
 were
 we
 prepared
 or


not


prepared?
 That
 process
 of
 learning
 will


position
 you
 for
 both
 preventing
 or


mitigating
 something
 like
 this
 from


happening
 again.
 And
 even
 more


importantly,
 it
 can
 enhance
 the


likelihood
 that
 you
 will
 use
 these


learnings
 to
 actually


innovate.
 You've
 all
 heard
 the
 phrase


never
 waste
 a
 good
 crisis.
 I
 don't


particularly
 like
 that
 phrase
 because
 I


phrase
 because
 I
 think
 it's
 kind
 of


trit,
 but
 what
 underlies
 it
 is
 actually


true.
 Those
 companies
 who
 have
 come
 out


of
 really
 tumultuous
 circumstances
 the


best
 are
 the
 ones
 who
 have
 gone
 through


the
 learning
 reflection
 process
 and


identified


opportunities
 to
 lead
 to
 create
 a
 new


product
 to
 be
 innovative
 to
 drive
 the


sector
 forward
 in
 ways
 that
 they
 never


would
 have
 considered
 doing
 had
 it
 not


been
 for
 the


crisis.
 This
 this
 is
 crisis
 leadership.


all
 five
 of
 those
 stages,
 not
 just


engaging
 in
 the
 damage
 control
 or
 the


response.
 So
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 for
 you


as
 a


leader?
 When
 you
 think


about
 over
 a
 period
 of
 time,
 what
 is


your
 response
 mechanism?
 If
 our
 focus
 is


on
 damage
 control,
 if
 our
 focus
 is
 on


simply
 responding
 to
 or
 reacting
 to
 the


here
 and
 now,
 we
 might
 fix
 that
 problem,


but
 we're
 not
 setting
 ourselves
 up
 to


really
 reap
 the
 benefits
 that
 could
 come


from
 the
 learning
 that
 takes
 place
 from


those


situations.
 The
 management
 behaviors,


you
 see
 them
 here.
 You're
 reactive.


You're
 focused
 on
 damage
 control.
 It's
 a


short-term
 focus.


limited
 stakeholder
 engagement
 because


you
 surround
 yourself
 by
 a
 very
 small


group
 of
 people
 and
 you
 hunker
 down
 in


the
 war
 room
 and
 you
 say
 here's
 what


we're
 going
 to
 do,
 right?
 Some
 of
 what


we
 heard
 earlier
 today
 is
 how
 do
 I


engage
 more
 people?
 How
 do
 I
 go
 to
 the


person
 who's
 five
 levels
 down
 from
 me


but
 is
 on
 the
 ground
 floor
 and


understands
 what
 or
 why
 we're
 in
 this


situation
 and
 how
 do
 I
 build
 that


information
 into
 my
 decision-making


going
 forward?


Okay,
 these
 management
 practices
 are
 not


bad.
 They're
 not
 wrong.
 They
 are
 in
 fact


necessary.
 But
 if
 that's
 all
 we
 do,
 then


we're
 not
 building
 a
 culture
 for


success.
 If
 instead
 we
 think
 about,
 yes,


we
 have
 to
 be
 responsive
 in
 the
 moment,


but
 over
 time
 there's
 still
 more
 work
 to


do.
 We
 need
 to
 identify
 what
 the


opportunities
 are
 around
 the
 business


recovery.
 We
 need
 to
 start
 engaging
 in


learning
 practices.


That's
 what
 differentiates
 those


companies,
 those
 leaders
 who
 are


successful
 in
 managing
 a
 crisis
 from


those
 that
 are
 not.
 Here
 are
 some


examples
 of
 leadership
 behaviors
 during


crisis.
 You're
 building
 trust
 into
 your


system.
 The
 worst
 thing
 is
 if
 a
 crisis


happens
 and
 you
 have
 not
 created
 that


foundation
 of
 trust
 within
 your


workforce
 or
 with
 your
 clients
 or


customers.
 when
 something
 happens
 and


you
 then
 need
 them
 to
 be
 there
 for
 you.


If
 you
 don't
 have
 that
 foundation
 of
 a


trusting
 relationship,
 they
 don't
 want


to
 be
 in
 that
 context.
 They
 don't
 want


to
 be
 stuck
 in
 a
 really
 bad
 situation.


That's
 when
 most
 people
 find
 the
 door


and
 exit
 immediately.
 But
 if
 they've


been
 with
 you
 all
 along,
 if
 they
 trust


you
 as
 a
 leader,
 if
 they
 believe
 that


you've
 had
 their
 best
 interest
 at
 heart,


that's
 when
 you
 get
 the
 team
 of
 people


that
 you
 need
 and
 you
 go
 through
 this


together.
 Building
 trust
 is
 a
 critical


aspect
 of
 leadership
 and
 building


culture.
 Again,
 being
 prepared,
 thinking


about
 what
 are
 the
 possibilities
 that


might
 come
 from
 this


experience,
 engaging
 in
 reflection
 and


engaging
 in
 learning.
 This
 is
 what
 we


teach
 our
 students
 and
 this
 is
 what
 I


know
 the
 best
 companies
 and
 the


strongest
 cultures
 engage
 in.
 So,
 what


are
 the
 opportunities
 to
 be
 realized?


one,
 decreasing
 the
 limit
 the


possibility
 or
 likelihood
 of
 future


negative
 events
 or
 two
 increasing
 the


possibility
 of
 future
 positive
 events.


It's
 that
 simple.
 You
 operationalize


what
 those
 outcomes
 are,
 but
 it's
 either


going
 to
 be
 good
 or


bad.
 I
 will
 end
 by
 sharing
 that
 we
 think


about
 the
 triple
 bottom
 line.
 I
 like
 to


think
 of
 it
 as
 a
 quadruple
 bottom
 line.


One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we
 must
 be


thinking
 about
 as
 leaders
 is
 preparing.


Preparing
 ourselves,
 preparing
 our


teams,
 preparing
 our
 organizations
 for


the
 unexpected.
 And
 Lord
 knows
 we
 are
 in


an
 environment
 right
 now
 where
 a
 lot
 of


things
 feel
 unexpected.
 And
 those
 who


have
 been
 prepared
 are
 the
 ones
 who
 will


come
 out
 of
 this
 context
 the
 best.
 Thank


you.


[Applause]
