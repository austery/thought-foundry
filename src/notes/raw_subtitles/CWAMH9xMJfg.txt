I
 was
 like,
 maybe
 they're
 right.
 Maybe


we
 should
 just
 sell.
 And
 I
 remember


having
 that
 conversation
 with
 Ben,
 which


is
 he
 said,
 "Hey,
 you
 can
 do
 whatever


you
 want.
 You
 can
 sell.
 You're
 going
 to


make
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 and
 you'll
 be
 super


successful
 in
 life,
 but
 you
 know,
 if


you're
 like
 me,
 you're
 going to
 look


back
 the
 rest
 of
 your
 life
 thinking,
 you


know,
 I
 missed
 that
 one
 shot.
 That
 was


the
 one
 thing
 I
 should
 have
 taken
 it
 all


the
 way.
 Now
 I'll
 never
 know
 how
 far
 I


could
 have
 taken
 it."
 Could
 have
 been.


>> So,
 do
 you
 want
 to
 live
 with
 that
 or
 do


you
 want
 to
 just
 have
 the
 money?
 You


know,
 I'll
 support
 whatever
 you
 want
 to


do.
 I
 really
 couldn't
 care
 less.


excited
 to
 bring
 back
 Boss
 Talk.
 This


was
 a
 series
 that
 you
 guys
 did
 a
 few


years
 ago
 on
 Clubhouse
 that
 was
 a
 a
 big


hit.


>> Yeah,
 we
 had
 fun.
 It
 was
 Ben's
 idea.


>> Yeah.
 Excited
 to
 bring
 it
 back.
 So,
 in


the
 spirit
 of
 of
 of
 boss
 talk,
 let's


talk
 about
 the
 the
 first
 time
 that
 you


became
 a
 boss
 in
 terms
 of
 running
 uh
 uh


data
 bricks.
 Um,
 let's
 talk
 about
 the


moment
 in
 2016
 when
 data
 bricks
 was
 was


uh
 not
 things
 weren't
 as
 smooth
 as


perhaps
 they
 should
 have
 been
 and
 we


were
 looking
 for
 a
 new
 CEO
 and
 uh
 Ben


you
 recommended
 Ali.
 First
 of
 all,
 like


kudos
 to
 Yan
 for
 building
 the
 company


originally
 and
 uh
 Ben
 uh
 you
 know


investing
 and
 believing
 in
 us
 and
 then


also
 I
 kind
 of
 couldn't
 have
 done
 the


CEO
 job.
 Uh
 Ben
 basically
 babysat
 me
 uh


the
 first
 couple
 years
 a
 short
 short


baby


>> you
 know
 so
 uh
 um
 but
 I
 I
 did
 know
 what


was
 kind
 of
 wrong
 with
 the
 company


because
 I
 had
 been
 there
 for
 two
 three


years
 and
 I
 had
 seen
 from
 inside
 you


know
 what
 we
 should
 change
 and
 what
 the


issues
 were.
 uh
 but
 we
 had
 an
 open


source
 project
 that
 actually
 became
 very


successful
 thanks
 to
 those
 first
 two


three
 years.


>> Apache
 Spark
 became
 a
 worldwide


sensation
 and
 we
 could
 pride
 ourselves


on
 the
 number
 of
 downloads
 uh
 of
 the


software.


>> Well
 and
 and
 and
 the
 uh
 the
 Spark


conference.
 Yeah.
 You
 know


>> Yeah.
 Spark
 conference.


>> Now
 the
 data
 and
 AI
 conference.


>> Yeah.
 But
 the
 problem
 was
 that
 uh
 you


know
 as
 it
 is
 often
 with
 open
 source
 is


that
 you
 just
 uh
 um
 everyone's
 just


downloading
 the
 open
 source
 version.


actually
 your
 biggest
 enemy
 uh
 is
 your


open
 source
 project.
 The
 main
 thing
 you


have
 to
 fight
 in
 the
 market
 is
 hey
 why


can't
 I
 just
 download
 the
 open
 source


version
 Amazon
 is
 offering
 it
 the
 cloud


vendors
 are
 just
 offering
 it
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 use
 that


>> so
 this
 was
 the
 biggest
 challenge
 that


data
 had
 at
 the
 time
 and
 we
 needed
 to
 do


like
 very
 serious
 aggressive
 pivots


internally
 which
 were
 going to
 be
 very


very
 painful
 to
 lots
 of
 people
 like
 to


the
 whole
 ethos
 of
 the
 company


internally
 and
 uh
 uh
 so
 I
 kind
 of
 knew


that
 for
 almost
 a
 year
 so
 when
 I
 got
 the


shot
 uh
 that's
 kind
 of
 like
 the
 the
 what


we
 started
 doing


>> the
 strategy
 was
 like
 make
 spark
 the


biggest
 open
 source
 thing.
 I
 mean
 I
 I


can
 remember
 it
 on
 all
 the
 slides
 now


and
 then
 you
 know
 data
 bricks
 would
 have


the
 best
 spark


but
 we
 never
 data
 bricks
 never
 had
 like


necessarily
 we
 didn't
 do
 a
 lot
 to
 make


it
 the
 best
 spark
 or
 or
 not


differentiated
 enough
 and
 that
 was
 kind


of
 the
 first
 thing
 all
 he
 did
 on
 the


product
 side
 and
 then
 he
 hired
 um
 Ron


Gabrisco
 which
 that
 was
 transformational


because
 that
 kind
 of
 dragged
 the
 company


into
 the
 world.
 Yeah.


>> So
 obviously
 that
 was
 the
 right
 right


decision
 and
 and
 paid
 off.
 Maybe
 zooming


out.
 Ben,
 you've
 worked
 with
 and
 and
 you


know
 all
 the
 great
 CEOs
 of
 our
 and


worked
 with
 them.
 Um
 where
 where
 does


Ali
 spike
 in
 where
 are
 his
 superpowers


as
 a
 as
 a
 CEO
 as
 a
 boss
 that
 have
 uh


helped
 you
 know
 contribute
 to
 the


impact.


>> I
 mean
 Alli's
 really
 good.
 So
 like
 I


always
 rate
 CEO.
 So
 it's
 like
 okay
 if
 I


was
 running
 that
 company
 would
 I
 do
 a


better
 job
 or
 a
 worse
 job?
 And
 and
 with


data
 bricks
 I
 do
 a
 way
 [ __ ]
 worse


job.


So,
 so
 he's
 good
 on
 many
 many


dimensions.
 So,
 I
 I'd
 say
 first
 of
 all,


you
 know,
 he
 he
 is
 a
 real
 technologist


like
 not
 a
 you
 know
 pseudo
 technologist


um
 like
 his
 competitors.
 I'm
 sorry.
 Um


so
 he
 really
 knows
 the
 product.
 He


understands
 the
 product
 strategy
 in


detail.
 He
 also
 uh
 ran
 engineering


before
 he
 was
 CEOs.
 you
 know,
 mostly


what
 I
 worked
 on
 him
 with
 with
 him
 on


the
 early
 days
 was
 just
 okay,
 go
 to


market
 and
 BD
 and
 um
 and
 he's
 really


good
 at
 both
 of
 those.
 Uh,
 you
 know,


that's
 where
 we
 had
 to
 catch
 up.
 You


know,
 Snowflake
 had
 an
 amazing
 go
 to


market.
 Uh,
 and
 then
 we
 needed
 a
 big


deal
 with,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of
 big


partners.
 And
 every
 time
 I
 I
 got
 him


like
 a
 little
 BD
 tutor,
 John
 O


Farerrell,
 who
 who
 did
 a
 nice
 job,
 came


in
 and
 kind
 of
 taught
 Olly
 about
 how
 you


structure
 a
 deal,
 how
 you
 do
 things.
 But


like
 he
 learned
 everything
 so
 fast.
 And


then
 probably
 the
 thing
 that
 he
 does


that
 is


I
 wish
 I
 could
 get
 all
 our
 CEOs
 to
 do
 is


he
 doesn't
 he
 doesn't
 hesitate.
 He


trusts
 his
 eye.
 Like
 he'll
 see
 something


and
 he
 doesn't
 know
 if
 it's
 right.
 And


so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 strategy
 changes


data
 bricks
 has
 had,
 you
 know,
 one
 big


one
 was
 building
 a
 data
 warehouse.
 Like


that
 that
 like


is
 a
 pretty
 big
 swing
 and
 a
 seemingly


like
 quicksotic
 insane
 idea
 given
 where


they
 were.
 Um,
 but
 you
 know,
 he
 he
 both


knew


he's
 paranoid
 enough
 that
 he
 knew
 that


that
 could
 be
 an
 issue
 and
 then
 he


trusted
 himself
 enough
 to
 go
 get
 deep


enough
 to
 decide
 whether
 to
 do
 it
 or
 not


as
 opposed
 to,
 you
 know,
 ignore
 it
 like


these
 guys
 are
 trying
 to
 kill
 me.
 I


don't
 want
 to
 see
 it.
 Um,
 which
 is
 what


a
 lot
 of
 CEOs
 do
 and
 you
 know,
 so
 that


kind
 of
 thing.
 But
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


there there's
 a
 lot
 of
 elements
 to
 that


job.
 It's
 a
 very
 complicated
 job.
 Al
 Ali


talk
 about
 more
 about
 the
 journey
 about


you
 know
 evolving
 from
 an
 academic
 a


technologist
 to
 someone
 commercial.
 Um


it's
 it's
 a
 you
 know
 journey
 we
 our
 CEOs


go
 through
 talk
 about
 what
 it
 was
 like


for
 you
 in
 in
 the
 context
 of
 what
 others


can
 learn
 from
 it.


>> Yeah
 I
 mean
 uh
 so
 so
 we
 were
 in
 academia


so
 we
 were
 you
 know
 scientists
 and
 then


you
 know
 I
 led
 engineering
 and
 product


so
 you
 got
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 build
 a
 you


know
 product
 and
 get
 product
 market
 fit


and
 then
 I
 became
 CEO
 afterwards.
 Each


of
 these
 has
 different
 sort
 of


challenges.
 I
 think
 that
 in
 all
 of
 them


the
 thing
 that
 is
 in
 common
 is
 that
 you


really
 have
 to
 understand
 and
 be


extremely
 good
 at
 the
 task
 at
 hand.
 And


so
 number
 one
 admit
 that
 you
 don't


actually
 know
 everything
 about
 the
 job.


Uh
 so
 a
 like
 you
 know
 first
 step
 of


anonymous
 alcoholics
 like
 admit
 you
 have


admit
 you
 have
 admit
 you
 have
 a
 problem.


Okay.
 And
 then
 number
 two
 uh
 be
 a


student
 and
 learn
 everything
 you
 can


about
 it.
 Right?
 go
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to


the
 details
 and
 try
 to
 learn
 from
 the


best
 and
 uh
 and
 then
 you
 know
 work
 your


butt
 off
 like
 you
 know
 you're
 you
 know


nothing
 you're
 zero
 right
 it's
 like
 you


know
 nothing
 about
 writing
 reliable


software
 um
 so
 I
 think
 for
 that's
 I


would
 say
 that's
 was
 the
 same
 thing
 I


tried
 to
 learn
 I
 tried
 to
 network
 with


the
 best
 heads
 of
 engineering
 with
 the


head
 best
 heads
 of
 products
 I
 try
 to


read
 every
 book
 you
 know
 I
 got
 as
 much


as
 I
 could
 uh
 you
 know
 out
 of
 Ben
 and


Mark
 I
 read
 all
 of
 their
 blogs
 all
 of


their
 books
 everybody
 else's
 but
 then


you
 know
 you
 do
 search
 and
 you
 start
 you


know
 search
 firms
 are
 really
 great
 at


getting
 you
 to
 meet
 who's
 the
 number
 one


product
 manager
 by
 reputation
 in
 the


market
 right
 now.
 Can
 you
 get
 30
 minutes


with
 that
 person?
 Just
 sit
 down.
 They're


not
 going
 to
 join
 you
 because
 your


company
 is
 too
 crappy
 and
 too
 small.
 Can


you
 get
 30
 minutes
 with
 them?
 You
 know,


can
 you
 get
 a
 dinner
 with
 them?
 Can
 you


get
 a
 breakfast
 with
 them?
 And
 then
 just


ask
 them
 lots
 and
 lots
 and
 lots
 of
 dumb


questions
 and
 they'll
 tell
 you.
 They'll


happily
 just
 tell
 you
 like,
 "Hey,
 here's


how
 I
 run.
 You
 know,
 here's
 how
 I
 do
 it.


The
 other
 guys
 are
 wrong."
 And
 then,
 you


know,
 they'll
 give
 you
 a
 playbook
 and


you
 can
 go
 compare
 it.
 You
 can
 go
 to
 the


next
 person
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 this
 is
 the


playbook
 I
 heard
 from
 like,
 no,
 no,


that's
 totally
 wrong.
 You
 don't
 do
 it


that
 way.
 Here's
 how
 I
 do
 it."
 And
 then,


you
 know,
 very
 soon
 you
 learn
 enough.


And
 if
 you,
 you
 know,
 really
 have
 grit


and
 you
 work
 hard,
 um,
 uh,
 you're
 going


to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 great
 things.
 That's


about
 you
 yourself.
 But
 also,
 if
 you


hire
 a
 great
 team,
 because
 as
 a
 leader,


you
 know,
 you
 alone
 can't
 do
 much.
 Um,


so
 can
 you
 hire
 the
 best
 people
 out


there?
 Uh,
 so
 that's
 also
 part
 of
 that.


Do
 you
 know
 what
 great
 looks
 like?
 Have


you
 interviewed
 all
 the
 best
 people?
 And


then
 can
 you
 now
 sell
 them
 and
 get
 the


best
 people
 to
 come
 work
 for
 you?
 Once


you
 start
 assembling
 a
 team
 of
 excellent


people,
 uh,
 then
 they
 will
 uplift
 you.


This
 is
 a
 managerial
 leverage
 that
 I


learned
 from
 uh
 from
 Ben
 um
 you
 know


which
 which
 is
 from
 high
 output


management
 uh
 by
 Andy
 Grove.
 Uh
 but
 it's


basically
 are
 they
 so
 great
 that
 you're


learning
 from
 them
 like
 you
 know
 it's


like
 Ali
 was
 a
 great
 head
 of
 engineering


but
 actually
 he
 was
 a
 great
 head
 of


engineering
 because
 the
 people
 that


worked
 underneath
 me
 were
 doing
 amazing


things
 and
 that
 was
 I
 was
 just
 standing


on
 their
 shoulders.
 So
 you
 just
 have
 to


do
 that
 and
 you
 have
 to
 instill


everybody
 else
 to
 do
 that
 recursively
 so


that
 you
 end
 up
 with
 a
 just
 you
 know


amazing
 killer
 team
 and
 you
 got
 to


continue
 doing
 that.
 Now
 you
 have
 to


okay
 for
 engineering
 it
 wasn't
 actually


that
 hard
 cuz
 I
 had
 written
 a
 lot
 of


software
 but
 now
 you're
 CEO
 so
 now
 you


have
 to
 do
 that
 for
 marketing
 you
 have


to
 do
 that
 for
 sales
 where
 you
 know
 they


were
 super
 helpful
 because
 they
 had
 done


it
 with
 loud
 cloud
 and
 opsw
 so
 they
 knew


how
 to
 build
 a
 B2B
 machine
 how
 the
 game


was
 played
 uh
 but
 you
 you
 have
 to
 do
 it


again
 but
 now
 you're
 doing
 it
 in
 a
 field


where
 you're
 really
 clueless
 and
 also


probably
 all
 of your
 instincts
 are
 wrong


and
 your
 intuition
 is
 completely
 wrong


uh
 so
 can
 you
 be
 clairvoyant
 and
 see
 the


truth
 or
 do
 you
 want
 to
 lie
 to
 yourself


and
 that's
 where
 I
 think
 a
 A
 lot
 of


founders
 make
 mistakes.
 Like
 they'll
 do


well
 in
 their
 own
 archetype.
 When
 they


have
 to
 step
 outside
 of
 their
 own


archetype,
 they
 make
 a
 mistake.
 They


hire
 people
 that
 are
 like
 their
 own


archetype
 in
 other
 roles
 where
 that


could
 be
 lethal.
 So,


>> by
 the
 way,
 that's
 how
 we
 started
 uh


data
 bricks
 was
 I
 think
 everybody
 was
 a


PhD
 in
 computer
 science
 who
 was
 running


anything.


>> Yeah.
 Like
 including
 sales.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 that's
 probably
 the
 number


one
 mistake
 is
 you
 just
 go,
 okay,
 well,


like
 I'm
 an
 engineer,
 so
 I
 want
 a
 sales


guy
 who
 can
 talk
 to
 me
 and
 understands


engineering.
 And
 that's
 like,
 well,


that's
 not
 a
 really
 good
 criteria
 for


sales.
 Like,
 one
 thing
 that
 I'm
 good
 at


is
 rather
 than
 telling
 somebody,


you
 know,
 that's
 stupid
 and
 hurting


their
 feelings
 or
 so
 forth,
 I'll
 ask


them
 a
 really
 [ __ ]
 up
 question.
 Um,


you
 know,
 actually,
 I
 did
 it
 in
 in
 a


board
 meeting.
 I
 I
 I
 said,
 "Well,
 like


could
 you
 help
 me
 with
 the
 math
 on


this?"
 Cuz
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 understand
 the


math.
 Um


>> actually,
 it
 was
 worse.
 I
 said,
 "Help
 me


with
 the
 I'm
 just
 trying
 to
 understand


basic
 math.
 You
 have
 all
 these
 numbers


on
 the
 slide."
 Yeah.


>> And
 if
 you
 said
 that
 your
 conversion


ratio
 is
 5%.
 But
 I
 can't
 divide
 any
 of


those
 two
 numbers
 to
 get
 5%.
 And
 then


the
 person
 freaked
 out
 and
 said,
 "No,


no,
 don't
 freak
 out.
 Just
 tell
 me
 which


of
 the
 two
 numbers
 do
 I
 divide
 to
 get


5%."
 Because
 I've
 divided
 all
 of
 them


and
 none
 of
 them
 is
 fired.


>> Like,
 am
 I
 going
 to
 be
 fired?
 So,
 so,
 so


he
 does
 a
 much
 better
 version
 of
 that,


which
 is
 he'll
 like
 if
 if
 somebody's


really
 really
 screwed
 something
 up
 or


messing
 he'll
 go,
 "How
 do
 you
 think
 it's


going?"
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 since
 he
 told
 me


that,
 I
 was
 like, "Oh,
 yeah,
 that's
 a


better
 way
 to
 do
 it.
 That's
 even


better."


>> So,
 yeah.
 Yeah,
 he
 he's
 he's
 a
 very
 good


student.


>> Can
 I
 refund
 that?
 So
 like
 you
 know
 I


think
 that's
 a
 you
 know
 there's
 this


book
 called
 radical
 cander
 and
 I
 think


people
 take
 it
 too
 far
 and
 they


misunderstand
 it
 and
 so
 on.
 But
 I
 think


the
 essence
 of
 that
 book
 is
 that
 um
 if


feedback
 if
 if
 you
 know
 are
 you


criticizing
 me?


>> Yeah.


>> Are
 you
 saying
 I'm
 stupid?
 I
 can't
 do


the
 vision
 cuz
 my
 point
 is
 not
 about
 the


5%.
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 make
 a
 different


point
 and
 now
 you're
 just
 this
 is
 a


cheap
 shot
 and
 now
 I'm
 like
 hurt
 and
 I


think
 by
 the
 way
 I
 think
 you're
 wrong.


It's
 not
 five.
 I
 said
 six
 and
 a
 half.


>> So
 are
 you
 criticizing
 me
 or
 is
 it
 like


no
 no
 I'm
 here
 like
 to
 help
 you.
 I
 can


like
 not
 help
 you
 but
 if
 you
 beg
 me
 for


help
 maybe
 I'll
 help
 you.
 So,
 which
 of


the
 two
 modes?
 So,
 if
 you
 can
 get
 people


into
 the
 mode
 of
 like,
 "Oh,
 wow.
 I'm


like
 being
 helped,
 like
 they're
 helping


me
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 get
 further
 ahead
 in


my
 career
 and
 I'll
 be
 more
 successful."


Uh,
 please,
 no,
 no,
 no,
 please
 don't


leave.
 Come
 back
 and
 tell
 me
 more
 like


cuz
 I'm
 I'm
 taking
 notes
 here.
 So,
 if


you
 can
 flip
 to
 that
 and
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 uh
 feedback
 can
 be
 recast
 into,
 you


know,
 I'm
 just
 here
 to
 help
 you,
 but


feel
 free
 to
 completely
 ignore
 this


advice.
 But,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be


really
 successful,
 if
 you
 want to
 get


that
 job
 or
 if
 you
 want to
 get
 that


project
 next
 time,
 if
 you
 did
 it
 this


way
 that
 you
 probably
 would
 have
 had
 a


higher
 probability
 of
 getting
 that,
 but


you
 know,
 I
 don't
 care.
 Like,
 you
 do


whatever
 you
 want.
 And
 then
 people
 are


much
 more
 receptive.
 They're
 like,
 "No,


no,
 no,
 please.
 I
 want
 to
 know
 more."


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 and
 then
 just


the
 frequency
 of
 it,
 I
 think,
 helps
 a


lot,
 too,
 where


if
 you
 if
 I
 see
 you
 once
 a
 year
 at
 your


review
 and
 I
 tell
 you
 what's
 wrong
 with


you,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 offended.
 No


matter
 what
 it
 is,
 no
 matter
 how
 wrong


it
 is,
 no
 matter
 how
 correct
 I
 am,
 it's


going
 to
 be
 offensive.
 But
 if
 every
 day


if
 I
 see
 you
 doing
 something
 I
 don't


like,
 I
 go,
 "No,
 don't
 do
 it
 that
 way.


Do
 it
 this
 way."
 Then
 you
 get


desensitized
 to
 it.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 the


mistake
 a
 lot
 of
 particular
 engineers


make
 is
 they
 just
 don't
 say
 what
 they


think
 when
 they
 think
 it
 because
 they're


afraid
 of
 hurting
 someone's
 feelings.


But
 that's
 how
 you
 save
 their
 feelings


because
 they're
 used
 to
 you.
 um
 you
 know


that's
 you're
 you're
 always
 doing
 that


and
 you're
 doing
 with
 everybody.
 They


see
 it.
 They're
 like,
 "Oh
 yeah,
 [ __ ]


Ben's
 an
 [ __ ]
 He's
 like
 always
 doing


this,
 but
 like
 that's
 how
 he
 is
 and
 like


that's
 how
 we
 work
 and
 it's
 no
 problem."


Um
 as
 opposed
 to,


you
 know,
 the
 the
 hammer
 and
 you
 try
 and


put
 in
 a
 [ __ ]
 sandwich.
 Oh,
 you
 do
 this


really
 well,
 but
 this
 is
 all
 [ __ ]
 up


and
 this
 is
 good.
 And
 people
 are
 like,


well,
 so
 like
 now
 in
 my
 written
 review,


you're
 telling
 me
 that
 for
 the
 first


time
 this
 is
 all
 [ __ ]
 up.
 Like
 [ __ ]


you.
 Yeah,
 this
 this
 is
 very
 common
 and


and
 you
 can
 see
 this
 in
 in
 the
 industry


that
 you
 know
 people
 it's
 like


>> you
 know
 the
 extreme
 version
 of
 it
 is


like
 they
 get
 fired
 right


>> and
 then
 head
 of
 HR
 talks
 to
 them
 and


they're
 like
 do
 you
 know
 do
 you
 see
 this


coming
 it
 was
 obvious
 right
 you
 knew


this
 no
 I
 had
 no
 idea
 like
 wait
 you


didn't
 get
 any
 feedback
 on
 this
 uh
 no


like
 I
 I
 only
 got
 thumbs
 up
 all
 along


for
 like
 a
 whole
 year
 so
 I'm
 in
 shock
 um


this
 is
 super
 common
 right


>> so
 maybe
 on
 the
 topic
 of
 managing
 talent


um
 you
 have
 this
 incredibly
 high


intensity
 culture
 at
 data
 bricks
 Um,
 and


there
 was
 this
 thread
 recently
 in
 our


CEO
 thread
 where
 they
 asked
 everyone,


but
 you
 had
 a
 great
 response
 on,
 hey,
 we


have
 50
 people.
 How
 do
 we
 scale?
 We
 have


this
 culture
 of
 996,
 right?
 You
 work
 99


six
 days
 a
 week.
 Um,
 how
 have
 you
 scaled


that
 intensity
 well
 into
 10,000


employees?


>> I
 think,
 uh,
 start
 with,
 you
 know,


setting
 the
 tone
 at
 the
 top.
 If
 you're


the
 hardest
 working
 person,
 you
 know,
 it


kind
 of
 everything
 will
 take
 care
 of


itself
 from
 there
 on.
 Uh,
 if
 you're
 not


working
 hard,
 it's
 very
 hard.
 I
 mean


it's
 if
 you
 have
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 double


standard
 I
 mean
 Ben
 has
 a
 whole
 book


about
 that
 like
 which
 is
 you
 know
 you


know
 it's
 basically
 you
 know
 what
 you
 do


is
 who
 you
 are
 is
 the
 whole
 title
 of
 the


book
 right
 so
 it's
 like
 if
 you
 are


working
 extremely
 extremely
 hard
 the


rest
 of
 the
 organization
 is
 also
 as
 well


uh
 you
 know
 are
 you
 calling
 people
 at


9:00
 p.m.
 10
 p.m.
 are
 you
 working


weekends
 do
 they
 expect
 you
 not
 that
 you


expect
 them
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 angry


and
 yell
 at
 them
 if
 they're
 not
 dropping


everything
 for
 you
 not
 that
 but
 the
 fact


that
 they
 just
 know
 that
 Ali
 is
 working


24/7
 and
 he's
 working
 7
 days
 a
 week
 and


you
 know
 he's
 working
 at
 11
 p.m.
 or
 2


a.m.
 or
 whatever
 it
 is.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 that


gets
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 done.
 Uh,
 the
 second


thing
 I
 would
 say
 is,
 uh,
 you
 can
 vet


for
 this
 when
 you
 hire
 people,


>> you
 know,
 and
 the
 easiest
 way
 to
 vet
 for


it


>> because,
 you
 know,


>> well,
 it's
 you
 got
 to
 be
 careful
 with
 it


because
 the
 people
 who
 say
 they're
 going


to
 work
 the
 hardest
 are
 not
 the
 ones
 who


work
 the
 hardest.


>> So,
 don't
 so
 don't


>> It's
 the
 opposite.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 100%
 true,
 right?
 So,
 the


best
 way
 to
 vet
 for
 this
 is
 to
 do
 back


doors.
 You
 know,
 ask
 people
 if
 if
 I
 ask


someone,
 you
 know,
 hey,
 how
 was
 Sarah?


Like,
 did
 you
 did
 you
 like
 was
 she


great?
 They're
 always
 going
 to
 say,


yeah,
 she
 was
 great.
 Right.


>> But
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 much
 more
 honest


if
 you
 ask
 them
 like,
 "Hey,
 how
 much
 uh


does
 she
 like
 grind
 the
 midnight
 oil?
 Is


she
 like
 and
 they'll
 tell
 you
 right


away.
 It's
 like,
 oh
 my
 god,
 she
 works


like
 crazy."
 It's
 like,
 um,
 you
 know,


she's
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 she
 has
 a
 good


balance.
 You
 know,
 you
 can
 like
 sus
 that


out
 very
 easily
 from
 back
 doors


references.
 You
 can
 people
 will
 remember


the
 people
 and
 they'll
 just
 offer
 it
 up


and
 say,
 "Oh,
 that
 person
 was
 like
 nuts.


They
 were
 like
 working
 24/7."
 So,
 um,
 I


think
 that
 way
 you
 can
 get
 people
 that


are
 hardworking.
 By
 the
 way,
 I
 don't


want
 to
 overemphasize.
 I
 don't
 think


everything
 is
 just
 work
 harder.
 You


know,
 you
 have
 to
 also
 work
 smarter.
 And


uh
 I
 think
 that
 you
 want
 to
 make
 sure


that
 uh
 it's
 sustainable.
 I
 can
 work


insanely
 hard.
 I'm
 motivated.
 Um


everybody
 has
 a
 different
 threshold
 for


how
 hard
 they
 can
 work.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 think


you
 want
 a
 culture
 where
 people
 are


burning
 out.
 I
 think
 you
 really
 should


avoid
 that.
 In
 fact,
 you
 know,
 at
 data


books,
 I'm
 very
 often
 going
 in
 and


saying,
 "Hey,
 this
 team
 like
 you
 know


your
 scores
 are
 really
 bad
 on
 work
 life


balance.
 Like
 what
 are
 you
 doing
 about


it?"
 or
 you
 guys
 should
 take
 several


days
 off
 or
 you
 should
 do
 some
 offsites


or
 do
 something
 like
 we
 we
 actually
 go


in
 and
 if
 we
 see
 that
 there's
 some


groups
 and
 other
 groups
 at
 data
 bricks


you
 know
 their
 their
 work
 life
 balance


scores
 are
 like
 100%.
 they're
 like,
 you


know,
 slacking
 off.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 so


then
 it's
 kind
 of
 the
 opposite.
 But,
 um,


but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 you
 can
 you
 can
 kind


of
 up
 for
 that.
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 that


also
 setting
 the
 expectation.
 Um,
 you


know,
 I
 would
 say,
 you
 know,
 uh,
 one
 of


my
 competitors,
 Frank
 Slutman,
 wrote
 a


book
 called
 Amp
 It
 Up.
 Uh,
 it's
 a
 great


book
 on
 how
 you
 get,
 uh,
 you
 know,


execution
 into
 a
 company
 like
 getting
 a


high
 performance
 culture
 where
 you


everybody's
 always
 trying
 to
 excel
 and


do
 better
 and
 better.
 Sort
 of
 that
 kind


of
 culture
 into
 a
 company.
 That's
 that's


a
 good
 book
 if
 you
 want
 to
 just
 study


and
 he's
 doing
 it
 at
 scale
 at
 bigger


companies.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 highly


recommended
 reading
 as
 well.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think


you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 at
 at
 his
 scale


ends
 up
 being
 things
 like
 organizational


design
 and
 do
 are
 people
 feeling
 like


they're
 having
 an
 impact
 when
 they're


like
 it
 if
 people
 are
 feeling
 like


they're
 having
 an
 impact
 and
 they're


good
 then
 they'll
 work
 very
 hard.
 Um,


but
 if
 you're
 in
 some
 kind
 of
 weird


three-legged
 race
 that
 the
 CEO
 has


constructed
 where
 everybody's
 got


dependencies
 on
 everybody
 else,


it
 it
 just
 doesn't
 matter,
 you
 know,


like
 you'll
 you'll
 just
 have
 a
 lot
 of


people
 go
 like
 I
 know
 if
 I
 work
 hard,


it's
 not
 going
 to
 make
 a
 difference.
 So,


like
 why
 would
 I
 do
 that?
 And
 like
 you


can't
 overcome
 that
 with
 rahrh
 and
 you


know
 lead
 by
 example
 or
 anything
 else


like
 that's
 just
 fundamental
 to
 how
 it


is.
 And
 you
 see
 in
 like
 look
 in
 any


company
 of
 any
 scale
 um
 you
 know
 even
 at


our
 scale
 like
 look
 there
 are
 some


groups
 who


really
 uh
 can
 have
 impact
 and
 work


extremely
 hard
 and
 then
 groups
 who
 have


lesser
 impact
 will
 work
 less
 hard
 and


you
 just
 see
 that


>> you
 know
 people
 who
 are
 motivated
 and


they
 feel
 excited
 about
 work
 and
 they


don't
 see
 the
 impact
 that
 they're
 having


they're
 going
 to
 work
 way
 way way
 harder


versus
 if
 you're
 demoralized
 and
 you


feel
 like
 it's
 it's
 not
 going
 well
 I'm


not
 having
 impact
 I
 don't
 have
 any


autonomy
 um
 then
 um
 you
 know
 you're
 not


going
 to
 you
 just
 don't
 want
 even
 you're


like
 kind
 of
 depressed
 sitting
 down


working.
 I
 do
 think
 there's
 one
 thing


here
 where
 leaders
 can
 really
 help
 which


is
 to
 make
 your
 team
 feel
 like
 they're


winning
 and
 that
 they're
 doing
 a
 great


job.
 Like
 you
 can
 ask
 more
 from
 people


but
 if
 I
 feel
 like
 hey
 I'm
 losing
 and


everything
 we're
 doing
 is
 wrong


>> and
 I'm
 putting
 in
 all
 these
 hours
 and


it's
 stupid
 like
 there's
 like
 what's
 the


point
 of
 this
 then
 people
 don't
 want
 to


work.
 So
 you
 you
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 like


feeling
 like
 we're
 winning
 like
 we're


the
 winning
 team.
 we're
 winning
 like
 you


know
 and
 wow
 they're
 expecting
 more
 from


me
 and
 you
 know
 so
 then
 I
 think
 you
 can


get
 you
 need
 that
 motivation
 in
 people.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Which
 is
 why
 by by
 the
 way


the
 hard
 job
 is


when
 you
 aren't
 winning.


>> Yeah.
 to
 get
 the
 output
 like


particularly
 in
 uh


>> Silicon
 Valley
 because
 you
 know
 you're


you're
 battling
 attrition
 this
 and
 that


and
 to
 get
 things
 on
 the
 right
 track


that
 that
 that
 that
 takes
 a
 whole


different


>> kind
 of
 level
 of
 technique
 and


storytelling
 and


>> show
 you
 how
 you
 could
 be
 winning
 and


all
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff
 that
 that
 gets


very
 very
 complicated.


>> We've
 both
 done
 that,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 There's
 been
 phases
 in
 our


company's
 lives
 where


>> we
 weren't
 winning.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 especially
 you
 know
 this


the
 story
 you
 had
 in
 heart
 about
 heart


things
 which
 is
 probably
 the
 best


business
 book
 I've
 read
 which
 I
 read
 by


the
 way
 before
 uh
 starting
 data
 bricks


and
 influenced
 us
 a
 lot
 um
 you
 know


those
 are
 superant
 yeah
 that's
 that's


the
 difficult
 that's
 such
 an
 important


point
 because
 even
 if
 you're
 winning


people
 got
 to
 feel
 like
 that
 but
 if


you're
 not
 winning
 getting
 them
 to
 feel


like
 you're
 winning
 is
 we
 have a
 path
 to


winning


>> yeah
 we
 have
 a
 path


>> we
 have
 a
 you
 know
 and
 it's
 like
 rock


solid
 it's
 going
 to
 work
 but
 It
 demands


sacrifice
 from
 all
 of
 us,
 you
 know,


>> and
 it
 and
 there
 is
 no
 feeling
 as
 good


as
 when
 you're
 not
 winning
 and
 then
 you


get
 it
 to
 winning.


>> Like
 that's
 the
 best
 feeling.
 You
 can't


replicate
 that
 once
 you're
 super


successful.
 You
 you
 never
 can
 quite
 get


that
 feeling
 again.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 true.


>> But
 you
 also
 never
 feel
 that
 horrible


pain
 again.


>> Well,
 it's
 easier
 to
 be
 the
 underdog
 in


some
 ways,
 right?
 You
 know,
 you
 have


nothing
 to
 lose


>> in
 some
 ways.
 in
 most
 ways
 not.


>> Well,
 I
 want
 to
 explore
 this
 leading


from
 the
 top
 because
 that
 was
 kind
 of


the
 first
 thing
 you
 started
 with.
 Um,
 we


actually
 hired
 an
 ex
 data
 bricks


employee
 to
 A16Z.
 So,
 we
 have
 some


inside
 scoop
 on
 your
 leadership
 style.


And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 he
 said
 was,
 you


have
 this,
 and
 Ben
 sort
 of
 touched
 on


this
 too,
 but
 you
 have
 this
 amazing


ability
 to
 be
 strategic,
 help
 your
 team


focus,
 but
 you're
 also
 very
 in
 the


weeds.
 Like,
 you're
 giving
 product


feedback,
 you
 respond
 to
 emails
 super


quickly.
 um
 and
 product
 launch
 emails,


no matter
 how
 small
 they
 are,
 you'll


respond
 congrats,
 which
 you
 know,
 he


found
 it
 hugely
 motivating.
 How
 do
 you


do
 all
 that?
 Like,
 and
 where
 do
 you
 fly


high,
 where
 do
 you
 fly
 low?


>> Yeah.
 By
 the
 way,
 I
 I
 respond
 even
 to


progress
 reports
 on
 all
 those
 products


and
 I
 follow
 them
 in
 detail,
 every
 one


of
 them.
 I
 try
 to
 respond
 to
 every


product.
 Insane


>> respond.
 But
 um
 um
 look,
 I
 think
 this
 is


if
 you're
 just
 going
 to
 fly
 high
 and


give
 highlevel
 like
 inspirational


speeches
 and
 then
 you
 know
 we'll
 trust


and
 we'll
 delegate
 to
 people.
 It's
 not


going
 to
 work.
 So
 my
 way
 is
 you
 know
 you


got
 to
 get
 in
 the
 weeds.
 You
 got
 to


understand
 this
 is
 back
 to
 what
 I
 said


at
 the
 very
 beginning
 like
 how
 how
 do


you
 become
 great
 at
 head
 of
 engineering?


How
 do
 you
 hire
 a
 great
 head
 of


marketing?
 The
 only
 way
 you
 can
 do
 that


is
 by
 being
 really
 excellent
 at
 it.
 So


you
 need
 to
 study
 the
 game
 and
 become


the
 best.
 So
 um
 so
 I
 try
 to
 stay,
 you


know,
 stay
 tuned
 to
 all
 of
 these
 things.


Um


>> there's
 this
 quote
 if
 you
 do
 everything


you
 will
 win


>> and
 then
 the
 question
 is
 you
 have
 you


done
 everything.


>> Exactly.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.
 So
 yeah
 so


you
 know
 you
 just
 it
 takes
 a
 lot
 of


effort
 um
 you
 know
 you
 need
 to
 learn
 all


your
 keyboard
 shortcuts
 um
 but
 uh
 but
 I


think
 that's
 you
 know
 people
 feel


motivated
 that
 hey
 I
 have
 like
 direct


relationship
 you
 know
 we
 used
 to
 say
 we


used
 to
 have
 one
 of
 one
 of
 the
 culture


principles
 used
 to
 be
 hey
 uh
 be
 a


co-founder
 uh
 and
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 have


any
 employees
 at
 data
 bricks
 we
 just


want
 co-founders.
 So,
 uh,
 and
 the
 key


point
 was
 like,
 hey,
 you're
 kind
 of
 the


owner
 of
 this
 company.
 You're
 not
 just
 a


renter.
 Come
 here
 and
 yeah,
 we
 can
 talk


about
 it
 and
 you
 can
 you
 can
 suggest
 an


idea.
 You
 might
 have
 just
 joined
 and


you're
 straight
 out
 of
 school.
 You
 might


have
 a
 great
 idea
 for
 a
 product.
 Tell
 me


about
 it.
 You
 know,
 I'm
 I'm
 happy
 to


push
 it.
 And
 so,
 it's
 it's
 making
 people


feel
 like
 they
 they
 have
 an
 impact
 and


they're
 inspired.
 Back
 to
 Ben's
 point,


then
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 much
 more
 exciting


for
 them,
 right,
 than
 following
 some


bureaucracy.
 So,
 I
 I
 don't
 follow
 the


bureaucracy
 basically.
 I
 go
 talk
 to


anyone
 I
 like,
 you
 I
 try
 to
 go
 to
 the


person
 that
 is
 actually
 the
 closest
 to


the
 work
 that's
 being
 done
 at
 any
 given


time.


>> Uh
 but
 there
 are
 some
 tricks
 and
 rules


around
 how
 you
 do
 that
 without
 breaking


the
 whole
 organization.
 So
 you
 can't


just
 willingly
 uh
 talk
 to
 anyone.
 Uh
 but


yeah,
 that's
 that
 that's
 part
 of
 it.


>> Yeah,
 you
 listening
 and
 giving
 direction


is
 is
 very
 different
 on
 that.
 If
 you


give
 direction,


you
 can
 cause
 a
 lot
 of
 chaos.
 Um,
 but
 if


you
 you
 go
 talk
 to
 people,
 you
 listen
 to


understand
 the
 problem
 and
 then
 send
 it


back
 down
 the
 chain
 of
 command
 tends
 to


work
 very
 very
 well.
 But
 look,
 generally


you
 if
 you're
 a
 CEO
 and
 you
 don't
 fly


low
 and
 fast,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 mess
 because
 you


don't
 you
 never
 get
 the
 truth
 because


the
 truth
 never
 makes
 it
 to
 you
 like


through
 your
 people.
 Like
 if
 you
 if
 I
 go


talk
 to
 Ali's
 executive
 staff
 about


what's
 going
 on
 in
 their
 organization
 or


anybody's,
 first
 of
 all,
 they're
 gonna


spin
 it.
 Second
 of
 all,
 they
 don't


actually
 know.
 And
 so
 like
 you
 can't
 you


need
 to
 help
 them
 debug
 their


organizations
 because
 they're
 they
 got
 a


million
 things
 going
 on.
 They're
 also


kind
 of
 going
 to
 the
 problem,
 going
 to


the
 bottleneck,
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


what's
 happening.
 And
 so
 like
 that
 it's


just
 a
 very
 unreliable
 source
 of


information.
 All
 the
 knowledge
 in
 a


company
 is
 with
 the
 individual


contributors
 that
 are
 doing
 the
 work
 and


the
 customers
 that
 like
 there's
 no


there's
 no
 knowledge
 with
 the
 people
 who


are
 talking
 to
 you
 as
 CEO
 who
 are
 on


your
 staff.
 That's
 not


that's
 not
 the
 way
 information
 moves.


And
 so
 you
 got
 to
 be
 now
 he's
 like


super
 fast


and
 which
 enables
 him
 to
 go
 super
 low.


But
 you
 know
 in
 any
 given
 time


the
 way
 to
 think
 about
 it
 as
 a
 CEO
 is


it's
 not
 like
 you're
 spending
 the
 exact


amount
 of
 attention
 to
 HR
 as
 you
 are
 to


you
 know
 the
 key
 engineering
 project
 as


you
 are
 to
 the
 you
 know
 the
 key
 kind
 of


sales
 competitive
 deals
 and
 that
 you
 you


have
 to


you
 don't
 address
 everything
 evenly.
 You


can
 never
 do
 that.
 It's
 just
 a
 bad
 idea.


Now,
 you'll
 probably
 get
 to
 everything


eventually,
 but
 you're
 not
 spending
 the


same
 amount
 of
 time
 on
 every
 single


department.
 The
 ORC
 chart
 is
 not
 the
 way


that
 company
 works.


>> It's
 just
 a
 communication
 architecture.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 think
 the
 best
 way
 I
 would
 say


it
 is
 like
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 T
 and


want
 to
 be
 broad
 and
 then
 you
 have
 the


leg
 that
 goes
 down
 and
 goes
 really


really
 deep.
 But
 you
 want
 to
 do
 that


anchoring.
 Uh
 and
 the
 key
 thing
 is
 to


have
 a
 really
 good
 priority
 order
 of


what's
 most
 important


>> and
 kind
 of
 drop
 everything
 else.
 like


you
 know
 you
 drop
 that
 tea
 and
 go
 really


really
 low
 like
 it
 might
 be
 HR
 I
 might


be
 deep
 diving
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to
 HR


looking
 at
 our
 HR
 handbook
 our
 policy


everything
 like
 who
 was
 this
 person
 what


happened
 why
 is
 this
 happening
 in
 that


group
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 that
 group


what's
 the
 culture
 in
 that
 group
 what


happened
 here
 like
 you
 might
 want
 to
 do


that
 it
 might
 be
 existential
 for
 your


company
 as
 we've
 seen
 some
 companies


went
 under
 because
 of
 HR
 problems
 right


uh
 or
 ethical
 issues
 that
 were
 going
 on


uh
 so
 I
 think
 having
 a
 really
 good


priority
 order
 is
 really
 important
 I


think
 some
 execs
 like
 they
 just
 want
 to


have
 a
 perfect
 ducks
 in
 a
 row
 I
 have
 my


weekly
 one-on-
 ones
 I
 have
 my
 weekly


staff
 meeting,
 I
 have
 my
 weekly
 this
 and


then
 I
 do
 this
 and
 then
 we
 follow
 the


rules
 and
 we
 do
 all
 of
 this
 and
 then


that's
 like
 just
 like
 the
 top
 part
 of


the
 tea


>> and
 then
 there's
 nothing
 that
 goes
 uh


deep
 and
 that's
 the
 issue
 I
 think.


>> Yeah.
 Over
 systematizing
 or
 or
 making
 it


like
 symmetrical.
 You
 don't
 even
 you


don't
 have
 to
 have
 one-on-
 ones
 with
 the


same
 frequency
 of
 all
 your
 staff
 or
 like


some
 of
 them
 you
 you
 know
 like
 you
 can


meet
 very
 seldom
 well
 like
 everything
 is


different.
 Every
 part
 of
 the
 company
 is


different.
 You
 may
 need
 to
 meet
 with


somebody
 every
 day.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 then
 other
 people,


>> you
 know,
 you
 can
 meet
 once
 a
 quarter


for
 now
 because
 it's
 just
 not
 that


serious.
 Um
 and
 you
 can't


get
 caught
 up
 in
 making
 everything
 fair


and
 symmetric.
 Particularly
 like
 your


staff,
 they
 got
 to
 be
 able
 to
 deal.


>> Yeah.
 And
 this
 is
 actually
 the
 biggest


conversation
 that


>> I
 had
 with
 Ali
 early
 on
 is
 like


if
 they
 can't
 do
 it,
 they
 can't
 do
 it.


>> That's
 it.


>> It's
 a
 wrap.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Don't
 try


and
 fix
 them.
 They
 can't
 be
 fixed.
 It's


not
 going
 to
 happen.


>> And
 you
 know,
 it's
 a
 sad
 lesson,
 but


important
 lesson.


I
 actually
 I
 want
 to
 turn
 the


conversation
 to
 an
 area
 that
 Ben
 was


saying
 you
 had
 to
 catch
 up
 on
 at least


in
 the
 beginning.
 Um
 which
 is
 the
 BD


dealmaking
 stuff
 which
 is
 interesting
 to


me
 just
 because
 I
 think
 of
 you
 as
 like
 a


consmate
 dealmaker
 now.


>> I
 feel
 like
 you're
 playing
 chess


everyone
 else
 is
 playing
 checkers.
 Um
 I


want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 2017


>> with
 maybe
 one
 of
 the
 first
 gamechanging


deals
 that
 you
 guys
 did.
 Um
 and
 that
 was


the
 deal
 with
 Microsoft.


>> Can
 you
 guys
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 more


about
 how
 that
 deal
 came
 about?
 Anything


you
 do
 differently?
 Um,
 and
 by
 the
 way,


founders
 still
 to
 this
 day
 ask
 us
 about


it
 because
 it's
 sort
 of
 a
 model
 for
 how


they'd
 like
 to
 do
 deals.


>> Yeah,
 maybe
 maybe
 I
 should
 start
 by


saying
 that,
 you
 know,
 we
 had
 tried
 to


get
 close
 to
 Microsoft
 for
 a
 long
 while.


I
 think
 Ben
 had
 told
 us
 you
 need
 to


that's
 an
 important
 partner
 uh
 because


they
 have
 the
 biggest
 distribution


channel.
 You
 know,
 they
 today
 they
 have


60,000
 sellers.
 If
 you
 can
 unlock
 that


in
 any
 small
 way,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a


game
 changer
 for
 you.
 And
 I
 had
 been
 try


and
 I
 had
 been
 CEO
 for
 a
 year.
 So,
 I'd


been
 trying
 hard
 to
 get
 uh
 in
 there
 and


many
 many
 people
 offered
 me,
 you
 know,


hey,
 so
 here's
 I
 actually
 know
 Satya,
 so


I'm
 going to
 get
 you
 introduced.
 And
 I


got
 multiple
 introductions
 to
 Satya.
 He


just
 like
 either
 never
 responded
 or
 just


CCed
 his
 EA
 and
 it
 went
 to
 into
 EA,
 you


know,
 like
 we're
 still
 trying
 to
 find


time.
 He's
 been
 so
 busy
 this
 last
 six


months,
 you
 know.
 Uh
 so
 uh
 but
 then
 uh


then
 he
 had
 a
 meeting
 with
 Ben
 and
 I


think
 he
 was
 here
 actually
 uh
 at
 A16Z


and
 um
 and
 uh
 they
 actually
 just
 talked


and
 I
 was
 not
 actually
 in
 the
 loop
 and


then
 he
 called
 me
 up
 and
 said,
 "Hey,
 I
 I


talked
 to
 Satya
 and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 he's


excited.
 He
 wants
 to
 do
 this."


>> And
 uh
 I
 I
 saved
 the
 email.
 So
 Ben


introduced
 me
 to
 Satya
 and
 this
 was
 I


think
 3
 or
 4
 AM
 I
 was
 like
 in
 New
 York


and
 the
 email
 went
 to
 Satya
 and
 then


Satia
 added
 like
 four
 or
 five
 people
 to


the
 email
 thread
 and
 then
 they
 added


four
 or
 five
 people.
 So
 like
 within
 an


hour
 I
 had
 like
 25
 emails
 in
 my
 inbox


and
 suddenly
 all
 these
 people
 that
 were


not
 responding
 to
 my
 emails
 from


Microsoft
 right
 after
 Satia
 CC
 the
 next


person
 they
 were all
 like
 hey
 I'm


clearing
 my
 calendar
 would
 love
 to
 meet


you
 do
 you
 have
 any
 time
 in
 the
 next
 two


days
 or
 3
 days
 or
 you
 know
 but
 really


kind
 of
 the
 original
 pitch
 of
 what's
 the


give
 and
 get
 was
 Ben
 and
 Satya
 at
 A6Z


and
 they
 kind
 of
 figured
 it
 out
 and
 I


was
 not
 actually
 even
 there.
 So
 we
 had


some
 luck
 and
 then
 Ali


did
 a
 couple
 of
 things
 that
 were
 or


quite
 a
 few
 things
 that
 that
 that
 were


very
 very
 effective.
 So
 the
 luck
 was
 um


at
 the
 time
 deal
 with
 big
 companies


there's
 always
 a
 timing
 element
 and


there
 was
 a
 company
 called
 Horton
 Works


um
 that
 had
 a
 deal
 with
 Microsoft
 to


provide
 some
 similar
 kind
 of


functionality


and
 they
 were
 basically
 um
 putting
 a
 gun


to
 Microsoft's
 head
 saying
 like
 you
 pay


us
 more
 money
 or
 we're
 going
 to
 pull
 our


product


>> and
 they
 were
 on
 prem
 and
 they
 were
 in


cloud
 so
 it
 was
 like
 a
 big
 mismatch


also.


>> Yeah.
 So
 it
 was
 a
 real
 So
 Microsoft
 was


like
 super
 pissed
 at
 them
 and
 wanted
 to


stick
 it
 to
 them.
 And
 so
 that
 was
 you


know
 so
 you
 have
 SATA
 going
 like
 I
 think


this
 company's
 interesting
 and
 then
 this


ground
 level
 thing
 going
 like
 we
 want
 to


[ __ ]
 these
 guys
 and
 that
 that
 kind
 of


opened
 enough
 of
 a
 door
 um
 to
 get
 it


going.
 Uh
 but
 there
 were
 so
 like
 one
 of


the
 most
 important
 things
 in
 the
 deal
 uh


was
 which
 you
 know
 and
 John
 O
 Farerrell


really
 emphasized
 this
 for
 for
 both
 of


us
 was
 look
 you
 got
 to
 get
 them
 to
 put


enough
 they're
 such
 a
 big
 company
 that


they're
 going
 to
 lose
 interest
 many


times.
 So,
 if
 you
 don't


have
 them
 write
 you
 such
 a
 big
 check


that
 somebody
 in
 there
 is
 going
 to
 get


fired
 if
 it
 doesn't
 go
 well,
 you're
 it


doesn't
 matter
 if
 you
 get
 the
 deal,


you're
 going
 to
 lose
 the
 deal.
 And
 so,


what
 we
 did
 is
 we're
 like,
 and
 the


technique
 that
 we
 had
 was,
 okay,
 give
 us


a
 forecast
 like
 like
 we
 we're
 a
 little


company.
 We
 we
 can't
 afford
 to
 do
 this


deal,
 you
 know?
 We
 can
 only
 afford
 to


have
 one
 partner.
 So,
 give
 us
 a
 forecast


of
 what
 you'll
 do.


>> Yeah.
 Cuz
 our
 engineers
 are
 busy.
 like


they're
 going
 to
 do
 this
 integration


that
 wipes
 out
 12
 months
 of
 our
 roadap.


We
 don't
 we
 don't
 have
 anything
 else.


You
 guys
 have
 like
 many
 thousands
 of


engineers.
 So
 this
 is
 we
 only
 have
 one


of
 these
 we
 can.


>> Yeah.
 So
 we
 you
 know
 whoever
 can
 sell


the
 we
 think
 you
 can
 sell
 the
 most
 but


we
 don't
 know
 like
 what's
 your
 so
 you


know
 like
 kind
 of
 challenged
 their
 kind


of
 manhood
 a
 little
 bit.
 And
 so
 they


come
 out
 with
 this
 big
 ass
 forecast
 and


we're
 like
 okay
 great
 just
 give
 us
 a


little
 portion
 of
 that.


>> It
 was
 a
 huge
 deal.
 It
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 it.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 then
 then then
 Ali


said,
 "Look,


you
 know,
 when
 we
 got
 all
 the
 way
 down


to
 the
 deal,
 he
 was
 like,
 "If
 I
 don't


get
 this
 number,
 Ben's
 going
 to
 fire


me."


>> And
 so,
 can
 you
 help
 me
 out?


>> It
 was
 very
 interesting.
 Bad
 cop.


>> It
 was
 a
 very
 interesting
 dynamic.
 So,


you
 know,
 John
 Farrell
 had
 strategized


with
 us
 and
 told
 us
 that,
 you
 know,
 they


have
 to
 do
 a
 big
 pre-commit
 because
 then


they
 have
 skin
 in
 the
 game,
 otherwise


they're
 just
 going
 to
 forget.
 They'll
 do


like
 the
 PR,
 but
 then
 they'll
 forget


about
 you.
 But
 then
 when
 we
 were
 trying


to
 get
 that
 from
 Microsoft,
 I
 remember
 I


was
 talking
 to
 Tekeshumoto
 who
 is,
 you


know,
 one
 of
 the
 main
 brains
 at


Microsoft,
 like
 one
 of the
 key


strategists
 there.


>> And
 his
 thing
 was,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 give


you
 a
 big
 commit
 cuz
 you're
 such
 a
 small


company.
 I'm
 worried
 you
 take
 this
 money


and
 you
 get
 drunk
 off
 of
 it
 and
 you're


not
 going
 to
 do
 anything
 afterwards.


>> And
 so
 I
 had
 to
 really
 convince
 him
 that


no,
 I'm
 extremely
 hungry.
 Like
 there's


no
 way
 like
 I
 will
 continue
 to
 have


crazy
 appetites.
 Don't
 worry
 about
 it.


So
 both
 sides
 were
 kind
 of
 worried
 about


different
 things.
 But
 but
 yeah,
 the
 give


and
 get
 was
 important
 that
 you
 said
 in


the
 beginning
 which
 was
 they
 had
 a
 gap


in
 the
 product
 portfolio,


>> right?
 They
 were
 competing
 with
 AWS.


They
 had
 a
 gap
 at
 the
 time
 and
 we
 had
 a


great
 product.
 They
 have
 amazing


distribution
 channel.
 So
 like
 in
 in


these
 BD
 deals,
 uh
 there
 always
 has
 to


be
 a
 give
 and
 get
 that
 actually
 is
 kind


of
 commensurate.
 And
 this
 is
 why
 most
 of


these
 deals
 fall
 apart
 and
 they
 don't


work.


>> There
 has
 to
 be
 something
 that
 you
 as
 a


small
 player
 can
 give
 that
 they
 don't


have.
 And
 usually
 you
 don't
 have


anything
 to
 give
 them.
 Uh
 usually
 I
 find


all
 these
 small
 companies
 show
 up
 and


they
 come
 for
 instance
 to
 data
 bricks


now
 and
 say
 oh
 we'd
 love
 for
 you
 to


partner
 with
 us
 but
 what
 what
 am
 I


getting
 out
 of
 it
 right?
 You
 don't


report
 to
 me
 I
 don't
 report
 to
 you.
 So


the
 moment
 we've
 closed
 the
 deal
 if
 it's


not
 good
 for
 me
 neither
 of
 us
 will
 just


do
 our
 side
 of
 the
 bargain.
 So
 there
 has


to
 be
 something
 in
 the
 deal
 dynamics
 in


the
 construct
 that
 inherently
 is


extremely
 beneficial
 both
 sides.
 There


has
 to
 be
 a
 trade
 that
 makes
 sense.


Microsoft
 really
 wanted
 that
 product.
 We


really
 wanted
 their
 distribution


channel.


>> And
 then
 the
 other
 thing
 that
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 entrepreneurs
 don't
 understand
 is


any
 big
 deal
 of
 that
 size,
 you
 lose
 at


least
 three
 times
 before
 you
 win
 it.
 And


we
 lost
 that
 deal


>> 10
 times.


>> 10
 times.
 And
 like
 including
 like
 the


day
 before
 we
 were
 supposed
 to
 launch


it.
 Um
 the
 you
 know
 the
 the
 antibodies


came
 out
 of
 the
 company
 and
 uh
 Ali
 had


to
 fly
 up
 to
 Red
 VIN
 and
 sit
 there.


>> There
 was
 one
 engineer
 that
 just
 said


not
 doing
 this.
 This
 is
 not
 going to
 go.


We
 don't.
 He
 just
 he
 was
 they
 actually


put
 a
 guy
 in
 place
 at
 Microsoft
 who
 was


actually
 super
 you
 had
 a
 great


reputation
 but
 he
 was
 a
 builder.
 So
 he


just
 had
 huge
 problems
 with
 this.
 It's


like
 this
 is
 not
 a
 product
 I
 built.


>> Why
 would
 we
 why
 would
 I
 make
 this


successful?
 Uh
 so
 yeah
 there's
 like


usually
 there's
 like
 many
 times
 so
 like


if
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 grit
 those
 deals


will
 die
 because
 this
 deal
 died
 multiple


times
 as
 Ben
 said.
 It
 was
 like


completely
 over
 like
 it
 was
 completely


blocked
 by
 some
 exec
 that
 said


absolutely
 not.
 I'm
 blocking
 it.
 It's


veto
 it's
 over.
 And
 no
 one
 wanted
 to


overrule
 him.
 So
 you
 have
 to
 go
 in
 there


and
 work.
 You
 have
 to
 And
 the
 only
 way


we
 did
 I
 like
 they
 call
 it
 the
 nerd


bird.
 I
 would
 take
 the
 you
 know
 uh
 SF


Seattle
 flight
 up
 there.
 I
 was
 up
 there


so
 much.
 I
 knew
 all
 the
 buildings,
 all


the
 rooms,
 everything.
 So
 you
 just
 have


to
 spend
 time
 on
 the
 ground
 and
 talk
 to


as
 many
 people
 as
 possible
 and
 sort
 of


influence
 that
 organization
 from
 within.


And
 I
 will
 say
 look,
 you
 know,
 with
 with


all
 the
 difficulty
 of
 the
 deal
 and
 um


you
 know,
 and
 and
 Microsoft
 being


Microsoft,
 they've
 been
 as
 good
 a


partner
 um
 as
 not
 only
 we've
 had
 a
 data


bricks,
 but
 in
 the
 entire
 portfolio.
 I


mean
 they've
 really
 you
 know
 lived
 up


and
 delivered
 uh
 what
 they
 said
 they


would
 do
 which
 is
 I
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to


give
 such
 a
 a
 huge
 credit
 because
 like


in
 the
 whole
 Gates
 and
 Balmer
 era
 they


were
 never
 that
 good
 a
 partner
 to


anybody
 and
 he's
 really
 turned
 that


around
 and
 um
 you
 know
 they
 they've
 been


fantastic
 with
 us.
 This
 was
 around
 the


time
 where
 Satcha
 had
 taken
 over
 and
 you


know
 he
 was
 giving
 to
 everyone
 at


Microsoft
 the
 book
 growth
 mindset
 or


mindset
 which
 is
 about
 growth
 mindset.


So
 there
 was
 this
 kind
 of
 aura
 in
 the


air
 that
 you
 know
 we
 should
 we
 should


try
 like
 let's
 try
 to
 make
 things


happen.
 Let's
 have
 a
 growth
 mindset


here.
 Let's
 see
 is
 there
 a
 way
 we
 can


partner.
 So
 this
 would
 have
 been


impossible
 five
 years
 earlier.
 So
 is


kudos
 to
 Satia
 and
 they
 put
 us
 on
 the


map
 and
 he's
 been
 a
 great
 partner
 ever


since.
 You
 know
 whenever
 there's
 been


issues
 they
 always
 resolve
 it.
 Uh
 so
 um


you
 know
 we
 are
 very
 thankful.
 We


wouldn't
 be
 where
 we
 are
 without
 them.


>> Yeah.
 No
 just
 amazing
 amazing
 really.
 I


I
 want
 to
 open
 up
 the
 conversation
 to


dealm
 more
 more
 broadly
 now
 that
 you're


not
 a
 small
 company
 anymore
 and
 you're
 a


big
 company
 making
 acquisitions
 you
 know


uh
 tabular
 neon
 mosaic
 just
 to
 name
 a


few
 what
 is
 your
 sort
 of
 your
 your


approach
 in
 terms
 of
 when
 to
 to
 to
 build


versus
 when
 to
 buy
 slash
 how
 do
 you


think
 about
 sort
 of
 acquisitions
 more


broadly?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 what
 we
 try
 to
 not


do,
 so
 let's
 start
 with
 a
 simple
 thing


uh
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 especially
 at


scale
 they'll
 buy
 revenue.
 So
 they'll


look
 at
 a
 company
 they
 say
 hey
 this


company
 is
 this
 size
 we'll
 just
 uh
 buy


that
 company
 we'll
 put
 more
 sales
 people


on
 it
 then
 we
 can
 accelerate
 the
 revenue


we're
 buying
 that
 revenue
 uh
 and
 that's


how
 they're
 doing
 it.
 Um
 we're
 not
 doing


that.
 You
 know
 what
 we're
 really
 doing


is
 number
 one
 we
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time


with
 the
 team
 and
 the
 founders.
 So
 we're


trying
 to
 see
 hey
 can
 we
 build
 together


like
 you
 come
 here
 and
 you
 build


together
 that's
 very
 different
 from
 that


buying
 revenue
 model
 the
 buying
 revenue


model
 often
 times
 you
 part
 ways
 from
 the


C
 with
 the
 CEO
 from
 day
 one
 like
 you
 can


see
 the
 big
 companies
 they
 literally


have
 a
 plan
 like
 I
 have
 you
 know
 have


some
 execs
 that
 come
 from
 these
 big


companies
 they
 say
 hey
 our
 plan
 usually


is
 to
 part
 ways
 with
 the
 CEO
 like
 you


make
 a
 deal
 and
 the
 CEO
 can
 leave
 um
 and


then
 but
 also
 the
 key
 people
 in
 those


companies
 quickly
 leave
 all
 of
 them
 like


the
 top
 management
 and
 then
 you
 know
 you


keep
 promoting
 the
 people
 from
 below


that
 couldn't
 get
 promoted
 before
 and


then
 eventually
 you
 bring
 in
 your
 own


people
 to
 take
 over
 the
 company
 and
 then


the
 company
 is
 dead.
 There's
 nothing


left
 of
 it
 and
 there's
 no
 integration


between
 that
 asset
 that
 you
 bought
 and


the
 platform
 that
 you
 have.
 Um,
 so
 to


avoid
 all
 of
 those,
 can
 you
 get
 people


that
 really
 feel
 like
 they're
 your


co-founders?
 So,
 we
 spent
 just
 enormous


amount
 of
 time
 with
 who
 we're
 like
 the


the
 company
 you're
 buying,
 who
 are
 the


founders,
 how
 do
 they
 work,
 are
 we


culturally
 the
 same?
 Spend
 time
 with


them.
 Do
 we
 get along?
 Do
 we
 see
 the


world
 the
 same
 way?
 You
 know,
 are
 we


going
 to
 click?
 Are
 we
 going
 to
 do
 this


together?
 Um,
 are
 we
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


build
 in
 the
 next
 five
 years?
 So,
 that's


where
 we
 spend
 number
 one.
 Number
 two,


we
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on
 uh
 on
 the


product.
 You
 know,
 what's
 the
 product


experience?
 How
 would
 we
 integrate
 this?


What
 would
 it
 look
 like?
 How
 much
 can
 we


can
 we
 rewrite
 most
 of
 it?
 Can
 we
 not


rewrite
 it?
 What's
 the
 what
 programming?


Like
 I
 always
 ask
 this
 and
 people
 like


why
 that's
 such
 a
 dumb
 question.
 I
 ask


what
 what
 language
 would
 you
 write
 it


in?
 Like
 why
 do
 you
 want
 to
 do that?


What
 is
 what
 does
 that
 matter?
 No,


because
 we're
 going
 to
 integrate
 the


code
 bases,
 right?
 It's
 like
 the
 build


systems
 won't
 work.
 It's
 not
 going
 to


even
 compile.
 So
 um
 uh
 so
 a
 product
 is


something
 we
 spend
 a
 huge
 amount
 of
 time


and
 talking
 to
 customers
 understanding


what
 the
 um
 what
 the
 what
 the
 excitement


around
 that
 product
 looks
 like
 and
 how


the
 integration
 would
 look
 like.
 The


last
 thing
 we
 do
 is
 we
 look
 at
 the


financials
 you
 know
 what's
 the
 revenue


multiple
 and
 you
 know
 how
 much
 can
 we


grow
 it
 and
 what's
 the
 three-year
 plan


five
 year
 plan
 and
 so
 on
 and
 I
 feel
 like


big
 companies
 corporative
 departments
 do


it
 exactly
 in
 the
 reverse
 order
 of
 this.


They
 start
 with
 hey
 the
 revenue
 is
 this


but
 we
 could
 accelerate
 it
 and
 the


multiple
 is
 so
 low
 and
 like
 you
 know
 in


this
 in
 my
 Excel
 sheet
 here
 this
 makes


perfect
 sense
 uh
 you
 know
 and
 then


second
 they
 go
 to
 like
 hey
 is
 this
 a


good
 product
 and
 then
 lastly
 like
 hey


how
 do
 we
 convince
 these
 knuckleheads
 I


mean
 we
 probably
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 them


here
 but
 we
 got
 to
 pay
 them
 off
 somehow


so
 uh
 so
 I
 think
 you
 know
 thinking
 about


it
 that
 way
 you
 get
 more
 longevity
 out


of
 it.
 Yeah.
 And


this
 is
 this
 really
 comes
 it
 sounds
 like


he's
 talking
 um
 like
 a
 product
 guy,
 but


this
 is
 really
 the
 thing
 that
 people
 get


wrong
 on
 the
 go
 to
 market
 because
 what


happens
 is
 if
 you've
 got
 multiple


product
 architectures,


that's
 going
 to
 mean
 multiple
 SE
 forces,


multiple
 posts
 sales
 things,
 and
 your


entire
 sales
 efficiency
 is
 going
 to
 go


through
 the
 floor
 And
 because,


you
 know,
 they
 have
 a
 keen
 eye
 on
 that,


everything
 they
 buy
 ends
 up
 looking
 like


a
 data
 bricks
 product,
 you
 know,
 like


and
 and
 that
 work
 is
 going
 in.
 They're


not
 just
 selling
 some
 [ __ ]
 to
 get
 some


money
 to,
 you
 know,
 go
 on
 a
 corp
 dev


thing.
 And
 and
 I
 would
 say
 so
 many


uh
 like
 when
 you
 bring
 in
 a
 professional


CEO,
 this
 is
 what
 they
 screw
 up
 because


they
 don't
 understand
 that.
 Yeah.


Engineering
 goes,
 "Yeah,
 yeah,
 we
 can


take
 it
 on.
 There's
 another
 set
 of


engineers.
 We
 don't
 care
 if
 they
 work
 on


that."
 Blah,
 blah,
 blah.
 And
 engineering


gets
 less
 efficient
 too,
 but
 it
 wrecks


the
 field
 and
 that's
 um
 and
 then
 the


customers
 hate
 it
 because
 it
 Yeah.
 Like


okay,
 I've
 got
 to
 learn
 another
 access


control
 model.
 I
 got
 to
 do
 this.
 I
 got


you
 know
 these
 are
 not
 things
 anybody


wants
 to
 be
 part
 of.


>> Yeah,
 100%.
 Yeah.
 This
 is
 it's
 the
 go
 to


market
 side
 that
 you're
 worried
 about


that
 you
 know
 that
 experience
 that
 those


customers
 will
 have.
 Uh
 you
 know
 they're


going
 to
 come
 back
 immediately
 and
 say,


"Hey,
 we
 were
 so
 we
 were
 already
 upset


about
 these
 things
 before
 the


acquisition.
 Maybe
 you
 can
 fix
 them


now."
 It's
 like
 no
 actually
 you
 know


several
 of
 those
 people
 actually
 quit


and
 now
 we're
 going to
 just
 work
 on


integration
 and
 that
 thing
 now
 got


pushed
 out
 another
 two
 years.
 Yeah.


>> Um
 so
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 in
 that


situation.
 So
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 companies


that
 do
 that
 and
 by
 the
 way
 it
 work
 what


they're
 doing
 works
 revenue
 wise.
 They


are
 getting
 the
 revenue
 they
 are
 getting


the
 the
 stock
 swap
 works
 like
 you
 know


if
 they're
 multiple
 of
 the


>> it's
 a
 creative
 deal
 temporarily.


>> Yeah
 it
 works
 and
 then
 the
 first
 year


you
 get
 the
 bump
 in
 the
 revenue
 you
 get


a
 second
 year
 boost
 in
 revenue
 growth
 as


well.
 So
 fin
 the
 financial
 engineering


actually
 works
 great
 for
 those


companies.
 It's
 just
 long
 term.
 It
 ends


up
 being
 like,
 you
 know,
 a
 bag
 of
 crap


that
 doesn't
 work
 together


>> and
 it
 affects
 a
 brand.
 You
 know,
 like


one
 of the
 things
 is


the
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 data
 bricks
 is
 so


powerful
 is
 all
 their
 customers
 want
 to


buy
 all
 their
 products
 because
 they're


like
 we
 know
 that's
 the
 best
 software
 we


buy.
 And
 as
 soon
 as
 you
 start
 chipping


away
 at
 that
 with
 these
 financial


strategies,
 like
 you
 can't
 get
 it
 back


because
 the
 reputation
 is
 every


customer's
 experience.
 There
 is
 there's


no
 marketing
 through
 that.


>> It's
 the
 best
 software
 because
 it
 was


written
 by
 the
 engineers
 and
 built
 by


those
 that
 were
 the
 best.
 Yeah.


>> Including
 the
 acquisitions
 that
 we
 got.


They
 were
 phenomenal
 people
 that
 came
 in


and
 they
 continue
 and
 since
 we
 gelled,


they
 continued
 building
 it.


>> So
 that's
 why
 it's
 great.
 It's
 like
 the,


you
 know,
 so
 we
 pay
 a
 lot
 of
 attention.


That's
 like
 back
 to
 the,
 you
 know,
 who


are
 you
 getting
 into
 your
 company?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Uh
 that's
 the
 other
 thing,


right?
 Like
 you
 can
 buy
 something
 that's


got
 a
 lot
 of
 sales
 where
 you're


downgrading
 your
 whole
 like
 company.


Ross
 Perau
 actually
 wrote
 about
 in


Citizen
 Perau
 his
 biggest
 fear
 which


definitely
 came
 true
 was
 he
 built
 this


elite
 thing
 at
 EDS
 and
 then
 they
 would


actually
 acquire
 IT
 departments
 and


they're
 like
 he
 was
 like


they're
 going
 to
 absorb
 us
 not
 vice


versa
 and
 that
 does
 happen.
 M


>> yeah
 there
 there
 is
 one
 really
 good


company
 that
 um
 well
 one
 really


successful
 company
 that
 we
 never


acquired
 and
 I
 always
 vetoed
 it
 whenever


it
 came
 up
 because
 I
 just
 think
 that
 the


quality
 of
 their
 employee
 base
 is
 not


great
 and
 I
 didn't
 want
 it
 to
 dilute


data
 bricks
 uh
 you
 know
 otherwise
 from


every
 other
 angle
 that
 deal
 always
 made


sense
 and
 I
 always
 vetoed
 it
 because
 I


felt
 that
 you
 know
 it's
 just
 they're
 all


going
 to
 quit
 or
 be
 super
 unhappy
 let's


just
 not
 do
 it.
 Yeah.
 It's
 also
 why
 like


merger
 of
 equals
 are
 because


>> Yeah,


>> because
 the
 cultures
 aren't
 equal.
 The


people
 aren't
 equal.


>> And
 what
 made
 you
 feel
 that
 way?
 You


just
 spent
 time
 with
 them
 and
 you
 they


just
 didn't
 exude
 sort
 of
 data
 bricks


culture.


>> Well,
 I
 mean
 it's
 look
 it's
 it's
 like


with
 everything
 else
 like
 it's
 like
 when


we
 were
 gra
 grading
 students
 at
 the


university
 it's
 like
 okay
 the
 rock
 stars


are
 super
 easy
 to
 find
 out.
 So
 they're


like
 there
 and
 then
 the
 people
 that
 are


really
 really
 bad
 that's
 like
 it's
 not


hard
 and
 then
 there
 are
 people
 in
 the


middle
 that's
 it's it's
 that's
 in
 the


gray
 zone.
 this
 was
 a
 company
 that
 was,


you
 know,
 I
 feel
 like
 the
 talent
 is
 not


phenomenal
 and
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 be
 a


genius
 to
 know
 that.
 And
 then
 there's


some
 startups,
 you
 know,
 immediately


like,
 you
 know,
 okay,
 these
 guys
 are


Olympia
 winners
 and
 they're
 like


phenomenal
 and
 they're
 like
 executing


like
 crazy
 and
 they
 have
 a
 track
 record.


>> Uh,
 so
 I
 don't
 think
 those
 are
 that
 hard


and
 we
 try
 to
 hire
 these
 and
 these
 this


is
 the
 one
 that
 I
 vetoed.
 The
 hard
 part


is
 what
 do
 you
 do
 with
 the
 ones
 in
 the


middle?


>> That's
 always
 where
 you
 spend
 all
 of


your
 energy
 trying
 to
 sus
 out
 like,
 you


know,
 okay,
 they're
 not
 stellar
 stellar,


but
 maybe
 they
 are.
 Maybe
 they
 just


didn't
 have
 maybe
 they
 didn't
 have
 the


go
 to
 market,
 they
 didn't
 have
 the


funding,
 they
 didn't
 have
 the
 support


that
 they
 needed
 and
 so
 on.
 Maybe
 they


could
 if
 we
 give
 them
 a
 chance
 or
 maybe


they're
 just
 mediocre.
 Uh,
 and
 that's


where
 you
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 your
 time.
 But


you
 got
 to
 spend
 time
 with
 them.
 You


have
 to
 interview
 all
 the
 people.
 Um,


you
 know,
 you
 have
 to
 have
 your
 people


interview
 all
 the
 people.
 Can't
 just
 be


this
 can't
 be
 an
 Excel
 sheet
 exercise.


>> Yeah.
 And
 Silicon
 Valley
 has
 a
 lot
 of


lopsided
 companies.
 So,
 you
 know,
 you'll


have
 a
 great
 engineering
 team
 and
 a
 bad


company
 because
 it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 bad


leadership,
 bad
 go
 to
 market.
 You
 also


can
 have
 like
 guys
 who
 can
 sell
 anything


with
 a
 ridiculously
 like
 poor


engineering
 team
 and
 they
 can
 just
 sell


it
 and
 you
 know
 you
 got
 to
 be
 very
 very


careful
 about
 that.
 Actually
 our


you
 know
 our
 our
 our
 CRO
 at
 data
 bricks


is
 you
 know
 he
 came
 from
 a
 company
 that


you
 know
 he
 he
 sell
 anything.


>> Yeah
 he
 was
 he
 was
 he
 was
 he
 was
 selling


SFTP
 secure
 FTP
 which
 is
 free


>> and
 he
 was
 selling
 it
 for
 a
 while.
 He


was
 selling
 it
 for
 a
 lot.
 He
 was
 making


a
 lot
 of
 money.
 We're
 saying,
 you
 know,


the
 electronic
 medical
 health
 records,


you
 know,
 how
 important
 are
 they?
 If


they
 got
 dropped,
 you
 know,
 how
 much
 of


a
 risk
 is
 it
 to
 your
 business?
 Well,


this
 is
 secure
 FTP.


>> You
 need
 it
 to
 be
 secure
 on
 somebody


grabbing
 that
 file.
 He's
 good.


>> Yeah.
 The
 only
 thing
 I'd
 add
 too
 is
 this


strategy
 is
 probably
 making
 you
 more


attractive
 to
 the
 people
 you
 want
 to


acquire,
 too.
 They
 don't
 want
 to
 sell
 if


they're
 going
 to
 get
 fired
 right
 away.


>> Yeah,
 for
 sure.
 It's
 very
 competitive.


>> Yeah,
 100%.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,


there's
 also
 a
 reputation,
 right?
 people


know
 like
 they'll
 look
 back
 and
 say,


"Okay,
 what
 happened
 to
 your
 previous


acquisitions?"


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 was
 there
 a
 huge
 fight
 and


everybody's
 quitting
 left
 and
 right
 or


you
 know,
 did
 they
 work
 out?
 You
 know,


how
 are
 you
 taking
 care
 of
 those
 people?


You
 know,
 are
 they
 what
 roles
 do
 they


have?
 Do
 they
 have
 influential
 roles
 in


your
 company?
 Um,
 you
 know,
 that's
 also


important.
 So,
 you're
 setting
 a


precedent.
 You're
 setting
 a
 precedent
 in


many,
 many
 ways
 with
 acquisitions,
 M&A,


you
 know,
 deal
 dynamics,
 the
 price,
 the,


you
 know,
 when
 you
 go
 through
 the


lawyers
 come
 back
 and
 that
 you're


spending
 all
 those
 20,
 30
 days
 doing
 the


definitive
 agreement.
 Every
 little
 thing


you
 agree
 to
 there
 is
 a
 precedent
 for


the
 next
 deal.


>> Yep.
 Totally.
 No,


>> maybe
 actually
 just
 to
 turn
 so
 we're


talking
 about
 data
 bricks
 as
 an


acquirer.
 If
 we
 go
 back
 in
 time
 again
 to


maybe
 a
 moment
 where
 you
 thought
 about


selling
 and
 maybe
 that
 you
 know


>> you
 didn't
 actually
 seriously
 consider


that
 um
 but
 uh
 I
 wanted
 to
 actually
 just


sort
 of
 quote
 this
 infamous
 email
 sort


of
 circulating
 our
 firm
 that
 Ben
 sent
 to


>> Yeah,
 Ali
 brought
 it
 I
 had
 forgotten


about
 it.
 you
 brought
 it
 up
 at
 a
 board


meeting.


brought
 it
 to
 the
 bed.
 Um
 but
 uh
 and


actually
 this
 wasn't
 and
 this
 was
 not


pertaining
 to
 selling
 the
 company
 but
 it


was
 I
 think
 selling
 a
 a
 candidate
 right


and
 um
 you
 you
 talk
 about
 hey
 Ben
 can


you
 sell
 this
 candidate
 on
 the
 fact
 that


we'll
 be
 worth
 10
 billion
 maybe


>> the
 candidate
 was
 worried
 about
 the


company
 getting


>> he
 wanted
 he
 wanted
 to
 have
 a
 double


trigger
 because
 the
 company
 if
 databook


sells
 am
 I
 and
 they
 fire
 me
 as
 a


salesperson
 what
 equity
 am
 I
 going
 to


get
 so
 give
 me
 double
 trigger
 so
 I'm


protected
 if
 we
 get
 bought
 and
 I
 get


fired
 I
 vest
 all
 my
 equity
 immediately


Yep.
 Exactly.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 in


response
 to
 this,
 um,
 Ben,
 and
 I'm
 gonna


paraphrase
 this
 a
 little
 bit,
 but,
 uh,


he
 writes
 back
 to
 you,
 I'm
 like
 thinking


about
 Ben's
 tone
 in
 this,
 you
 are


severely
 underelling
 the
 opportunity.
 We


are
 Oracle
 in
 the
 cloud,
 and
 we
 will
 be


worth
 10x
 what
 Oracle
 is.
 But
 what
 was


your
 reaction
 when
 you
 when
 you
 saw


that?
 And
 did
 that
 give
 you
 more


fortitude
 to
 not
 sell
 the
 company?


>> Yeah,
 Ben's
 crazy.


I
 think
 the
 first
 thought
 was
 exactly


Ben's
 crazy.
 Uh
 but
 uh
 but
 no,
 I
 I
 think


both
 uh
 Ben
 and
 Mark
 uh
 always
 kind
 of


pushed
 us
 to
 think
 bigger.


>> I
 remember
 we
 did
 the
 pitch
 at
 a
 16Z
 for


I
 think
 our
 series
 D
 which
 would
 have


been
 around
 2017
 or
 so
 and
 uh
 the


question
 was
 asked
 um
 you
 know
 what's


the
 what's
 your
 biggest
 bottleneck?
 And


I
 said
 biggest
 bottleneck
 is
 hiring.
 He


said
 okay
 well
 who
 who
 who's
 are
 you


losing
 to?
 And
 I
 said,
 "Well,
 it's


Google,
 you
 know,
 it's
 the
 fangs."


>> And
 and
 the
 response
 I
 got
 back
 was,


"Well,
 you
 need
 to
 just
 add
 the
 data


bricks
 to
 fang.
 It
 needs
 to
 be
 fang
 db


with
 a
 straight
 face."
 And
 and
 it
 was


like
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 and
 my
 reaction
 was


I
 laughed.
 I
 literally
 said,
 "Yeah,


yeah.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 not
 serious."
 Like


it's
 like,
 "Yeah,
 that's
 the
 problem."


Like,
 "Huh?"
 It's
 like, "No,
 I'm


serious.
 You
 need
 to
 add
 data
 bricks
 to


fang,
 you
 know?"
 And
 and
 then
 there
 was


like
 a
 pause
 and
 there
 was
 like
 this
 and


I
 think
 it's
 doable.
 And
 so
 then
 I


actually
 went
 back
 and
 thought
 about
 it


a
 lot
 and
 I
 was
 like
 is
 it
 doable?
 Like


is
 it
 am
 I
 the
 crazy
 one
 or
 are
 they
 the


crazy
 one?
 Who's
 the
 crazy
 one
 here?


Like
 who's
 who's
 nuts
 here?
 And
 you
 know


and
 that
 kind
 of
 pushed
 us
 to
 think


about
 how
 do
 we
 change
 our
 com


philosophy?


>> Uh
 how
 do
 we
 if
 if
 we
 wanted
 to
 go
 and


get
 the
 best
 of
 the
 best
 out
 of
 Google?


What
 does
 it
 require?
 And
 we
 developed
 a


new
 model
 but
 we're
 like
 okay
 actually


the
 way
 to
 think
 about
 it
 is
 your
 market


cap
 divided
 by
 number
 of
 employees.


That's
 how
 much
 money
 you
 can
 give
 away


in
 terms
 of
 dilution.
 And
 actually
 we


did
 calculated
 the
 number
 at
 that
 time


and
 we're
 like
 wait
 we're
 actually


richer
 than
 Google
 in
 terms
 of
 you
 know


how
 much
 dilution
 we
 can
 afford
 per


engineer
 because
 they
 were
 at
 that
 time


this
 was
 like
 you
 know
 before
 the


Twitter
 downsizing
 so
 all
 the
 companies


were
 oversized
 so
 um
 so
 we
 did
 the


calculations
 it
 turned
 out
 that
 we


actually
 can
 probably
 pay
 P95th


percentile
 we
 did
 the
 math
 on
 P
 95th


percentile
 for
 engineering
 and
 it
 was


like
 yeah
 this
 actually
 the
 math
 works


out
 we
 moved
 all
 the
 comp
 bands
 and
 we


told
 them
 and
 we
 told
 the
 employees


about
 it
 it's
 like
 okay
 we're
 paying
 you


P
 95th
 you
 know
 and
 we
 can
 afford
 it
 and


uh
 so
 was
 that
 came
 out
 of
 that
 simple,


you
 know,
 so
 these
 simple,
 you
 know,


your
 trillion
 dollars,
 just
 add
 your


acronym
 to
 the
 to
 FANG
 and
 so
 on.


They're
 silly
 and
 they're
 kind
 of
 crazy,


but
 they
 do
 push
 you.
 And
 you
 go
 back


and
 think
 about,
 hey,
 what
 is
 the


fundamental
 reason
 from
 first
 principles


that
 we
 couldn't
 do
 something
 like
 that?


Why
 couldn't
 we
 be
 a
 trillion?
 What's


the
 bottleneck
 from
 being
 a
 trillion
 or


being
 part
 of
 Fang
 and
 then
 you
 think


about
 it
 and
 you
 start
 zooming
 in
 on


like
 can
 we
 unblock
 that?
 Um,
 so
 it
 it


has
 helped
 us
 and
 has
 been
 a
 driving


force
 even
 though
 it's
 you
 know
 it's
 a


little
 annoying
 you
 know
 you
 know
 it's


like
 you
 know
 hey
 you
 know
 hey
 mom
 dad
 I


got
 the
 A+
 it's
 like
 yeah
 but
 we
 ranked


I
 was
 number
 two
 in
 the
 class
 so
 was


someone
 better
 than
 you?


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 For
 what
 it's
 worth
 when
 I
 joined


the
 firm
 in
 2019
 the
 series
 F
 of
 Data


Bricks
 was
 the
 first
 deal
 I
 worked
 on


and
 I
 think
 the
 the
 valuation
 was
 six


billion.


>> Ben
 says
 to
 us
 oh
 well
 it's
 going
 to
 be


a
 hundred
 billion
 dollar
 company.
 And
 we


were
 like,
 "Yeah,
 yeah,
 sure,
 Ben."
 Lo


and
 behold,


>> they're
 doing
 all
 this
 work.
 I'm
 like,


"What
 are
 you
 doing?"
 Like,
 six
 billion,


seven
 billion,
 doesn't
 matter.


>> I
 was
 right.


>> He
 was
 right.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That
 one
 you


have
 proven
 to
 be
 right.
 Yeah.
 still


have
 ways
 to
 go
 for
 two
 trillion.
 But


>> well,


the
 thing
 that
 you
 almost
 never
 get
 and


Alli
 and
 I
 had
 this
 conversation
 the
 one


time
 we
 did
 have
 a
 real
 acquisition


offer
 on
 the
 company
 is


you
 just
 don't
 get
 this
 good
 a
 market


opportunity
 with
 this
 good
 an


entrepreneur
 like
 that.
 That's
 the


rarest
 of
 rare
 things.
 Like
 we
 we
 see


great
 entrepreneurs
 but
 their
 market


opportunity
 is
 limited
 and
 then
 we
 see


you
 know
 companies
 that
 have
 a
 great


market
 opportunity
 but
 the
 entrepreneur


is
 not
 big
 enough
 to
 fulfill
 that.
 Um


but
 this
 was
 a
 case
 where
 we
 have
 both.


>> Yeah
 I
 I
 remember
 actually
 the


conversation
 that
 kind
 of
 flipped
 me.
 Um


the
 acquisition
 offer
 was
 on
 the
 table.


It
 was
 six
 times
 bigger
 than
 the


valuation
 we
 had
 at
 the
 time.
 And
 I
 had


done
 the
 mistake
 of
 telling
 my


co-founders.
 And


>> yeah,
 they
 were
 like,
 "Let's
 go."


>> They
 were
 like, "We're
 done."
 So,


everyone's
 like,
 "Stop
 the
 work.
 Stop


working.
 Take
 your
 hands
 off
 the


keyboard.
 Nobody
 work
 anymore.
 We're


done
 here."
 Right?
 And
 let's
 count
 my


money.
 Like,
 you
 know,
 how
 much
 money
 do


I
 have?
 You
 know,
 what
 would
 you
 buy
 for


that
 amount
 of
 money?
 You
 know,
 so
 they


were
 like
 completely
 like
 not
 doing


anything.
 And
 there's
 just
 this
 crazy


gossip
 going
 around.
 And
 then
 it
 was


like
 they
 had
 told
 some
 of
 the
 exec
 and


then
 they
 were
 calling
 each
 other
 every


day
 like
 hey
 what
 all
 he
 think
 like
 you


know
 you
 think
 he's
 he
 looked
 in
 a
 bad


mood
 today
 you
 think
 he's
 going
 to
 say


no
 no
 it's
 like
 what
 did
 he
 say
 like
 he


said
 this
 thing
 he
 said
 this
 once
 so


there's
 just
 a
 lot
 of
 politicking
 going


around
 and
 nobody
 was
 doing
 any
 work


anymore
 and
 and
 I
 was
 like
 you
 know


maybe
 they're
 right
 maybe
 we
 should
 just


sell
 and
 I
 remember
 having
 that


conversation
 with
 Ben
 and
 I
 think
 we


were
 in
 a
 car
 both
 of
 us
 and
 u
 uh
 and


you
 know
 he
 says
 that
 he
 drops
 the


fbombs
 and
 he
 pisses
 people
 off
 and
 so


on
 and
 they
 don't
 take
 the
 feedback
 but


actually
 he
 did
 exactly
 the
 radical


cander
 thing
 with
 me
 which
 is
 he
 said


hey
 you
 can
 do
 whatever
 you
 want
 I'll


support
 you
 either
 case
 and
 actually
 if


you
 sell
 for
 this
 number
 it's
 really


great
 for
 me
 me
 being
 Ben
 like
 we
 make
 a


lot
 of
 money
 at
 A6
 and
 Z
 I'll
 pay
 the


investors
 back
 many
 times
 over
 so


honestly
 if
 it's
 for
 me
 personally


that's
 probably
 the
 better
 option
 um
 but


I'm
 just
 thinking
 back
 I
 was
 CEO


LoudCloud
 ops
 and
 you
 know
 uh
 just
 the


cards
 I
 were
 given
 that
 that
 company


wasn't
 the
 company
 you
 have
 and
 when
 I


look
 back
 how
 often
 do
 you
 in
 in
 life


get
 a
 chance
 to
 even
 have
 a
 company
 like


CloudCloud
 or
 Opsswware,
 let
 alone
 a


data
 bricks.
 And
 this
 is
 just
 such
 a


freaking
 big
 market.
 You
 can
 sell,


you're
 going to
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 money,
 and


you'll
 be
 super
 successful
 in
 life.
 But,


you
 know,
 if
 you're
 like
 me,
 you're


going to
 look
 back
 the
 rest
 of
 your
 life


thinking,
 you
 know,
 I
 missed
 that
 one


shot.
 That
 was
 the
 one
 thing.
 I
 should


have
 taken
 it
 all
 the
 way.
 And
 now
 I'll


never
 know
 how
 far
 I
 could
 have
 taken


it.
 Could
 have
 been.


>> So,
 do
 you
 want
 to
 live
 with
 that
 or
 do


you
 want
 to
 just
 have
 the
 money?
 You


know,
 I'll
 support
 whatever
 you
 want
 to


do.
 I
 really
 couldn't
 care
 less.
 I


really
 couldn't
 care
 less.
 And
 I
 was


like,
 "Okay,
 thanks.
 Hang
 up.
 We're


never
 doing
 this.
 We're
 done.
 This
 is


not
 happening."


>> What
 a
 pep
 talk.


>> Yeah.
 So
 that's
 how
 we
 did
 it.
 So
 it
 was


it
 was
 excellent.


>> I
 think
 I
 also
 said,
 "I
 guarantee
 you


you'll
 never
 have
 an
 idea
 this
 good


again
 as
 long
 as
 you
 live."


>> Yeah.


>> This
 is
 the
 best
 idea
 you're
 ever
 going


to
 have.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 an
 idea
 that


also
 takes
 off
 and
 works,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 so
 I
 want
 to
 tie
 one
 thing
 that
 you


said
 in
 in
 all
 of
 that
 is
 you
 were


company
 building.
 Um
 but
 then
 also
 just


sort
 of
 the
 calculus
 that
 founders
 but


also
 your
 employees
 are
 making
 and


that's
 around
 comp.
 Um
 so
 in
 the
 early


days
 you
 could
 afford
 to
 pay
 95th


percentile,
 right?
 Um


>> today
 there's
 crazy
 AI
 talent
 wars
 going


on.
 We
 we've
 talked
 about
 this
 a
 bunch


throughout
 the
 summer.
 Um


>> and
 we
 know
 that
 you
 can
 bring
 the
 best


talent
 in
 the
 house,
 right,
 to
 data


bricks.
 How
 do
 you
 keep
 them
 with
 all
 of


this
 craziness
 going
 on?
 Because
 now


95th
 percentile,
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 what


that
 means.
 Is
 that
 like
 you
 pay
 a


billion
 dollars?


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.
 Yeah.
 The
 joke


is
 which
 company
 says
 we're
 P50th?
 You


know,
 we
 pay
 P50th.
 Like
 who
 does
 that?


There's
 no
 company
 that
 does
 that.
 So,


how
 does
 how
 does


>> There
 is.
 Yeah.
 The
 75th
 percentile
 is


the
 single
 biggest
 lie
 in
 Silicon


Valley.
 It's
 like
 a
 complete
 fabrication


>> probably.
 Probably.
 So,
 um
 but
 um
 you


know,
 I
 think
 that
 um
 the
 it
 is
 a
 crazy


time
 with
 AI
 and
 I
 do
 think
 I
 feel
 bad.


I
 did
 actually
 an
 exit
 interview
 with


someone
 this
 morning.
 I
 feel
 bad
 for
 the


kids
 right
 now
 because
 there's
 like
 too


much
 pressure
 on
 them
 like
 they
 feel


like
 oh
 they
 have
 to
 start
 companies
 and


they
 have
 to
 and
 I've
 never
 actually
 had


anything
 like
 this
 because
 every
 year
 I


talk
 to
 the
 interns
 uh
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 I


get
 questions
 about
 how
 do
 we
 build
 our


own
 company
 you
 know
 how
 do
 we
 succeed


at
 data
 bricks
 and
 so
 on
 the
 last
 two


years
 have
 just
 been
 crazy
 all
 all
 the


kids
 are
 like
 when
 should
 I
 become
 a
 CEO


when
 should
 I
 start
 my
 own
 company


what's
 a
 good
 valuation
 am
 I
 missing
 out


if
 I
 do
 like
 an
 internship
 here
 for


three
 months
 at
 data
 bricks
 will
 I
 have


wasted
 my
 opportunity
 in
 life
 and
 this


is
 like
 the
 time
 for
 AGI
 And
 I
 could


have
 like
 been
 one
 of the
 guys
 that
 does


super
 intelligence
 and
 like
 you
 know
 how


would
 you
 time
 that?
 How
 was
 it
 for
 you?


How
 old
 were
 you
 when
 you
 were
 22?
 What


did
 you
 do?
 and
 you
 know
 and
 so
 um
 I
 do


think
 it's
 it's
 kind
 of
 crazy
 times
 and


I
 do
 think
 it's
 also
 exaggerated
 like


you
 know
 I
 don't
 think
 anyone's
 getting


hundred
 million
 dollar
 offers
 you
 know
 I


mean
 yes
 there's
 like
 one
 you
 know


character
 AI
 and
 so
 on
 but
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 actually
 true
 and
 it's
 also
 in
 the


interest
 of
 CEOs
 you
 should
 know
 uh
 to


say
 that
 hey
 you
 know
 the
 you
 know


people
 try
 to
 poach
 data
 people
 from


data
 bricks
 for
 a
 billion
 dollars
 and


they
 said
 no
 like
 it's
 in
 our
 interest


to
 say
 that
 right
 because
 that
 kind
 of


sets
 the
 bar
 at
 a
 billion
 and
 then
 any


employee
 that
 cannot
 for
 half
 of
 it's


going
 to
 feel
 really
 insulted.
 It's
 like


why
 don't
 I
 get
 a
 billion
 dollar
 offer?


Like
 I
 heard
 like
 on
 the
 news
 that
 the


other
 people
 are
 getting
 a
 billion.
 Um


so
 I
 I
 do
 think
 that
 the
 most


>> by
 the
 way
 Sam
 used
 that
 in
 reverse
 on


Meta.
 He's
 like
 oh
 yeah
 they
 offered
 all


our
 guys
 hundred
 million
 dollars
 into


the
 next
 guy
 who
 got
 the
 50.


>> Now
 I
 have
 to
 pay
 100
 at
 least.
 Right.


That's
 like
 the
 smart
 move.
 Um
 but
 I


would
 say
 that
 look
 u
 uh
 you
 know
 and


and
 not
 all
 startups
 have
 the
 valuation


of
 their
 we
 100
 billion
 and
 you
 know


with
 10,000
 employees
 we
 actually
 can


afford
 to
 actually
 pay
 significant
 and


we
 do
 pay
 significant
 for
 the
 right


talent.
 Uh
 but
 you
 know
 if
 what
 do
 you


do
 when
 you're
 smaller
 like
 we
 were


smaller
 at
 some
 point
 well
 then
 it's


talk
 about
 how
 big
 you
 are
 going
 to
 get


and
 what
 the
 opportunity
 is
 and
 what
 you


could
 do
 together
 and
 what
 it
 would


worth
 worth
 together.
 Um
 but
 I
 think


most
 uh
 most
 people
 earlier
 in
 the


career
 they
 really
 want
 to
 learn
 and


they
 want
 to
 really
 feel
 that
 they
 can


have
 impact.
 So
 if
 you
 can
 really
 bring


them
 in
 and
 you
 can
 sort
 of
 mentor
 them,


you
 can
 stay
 close
 to
 them
 and
 as
 a
 CEO


you
 have
 huge
 power
 if
 you
 can
 just


spend
 two
 minutes
 with
 uh
 you
 know
 a
 kid


out
 of
 school.
 Uh
 it's
 immense
 to
 them


and
 you
 say
 hey
 you
 know
 I'll
 I'll
 even


mentor
 you.
 I'll
 help
 you
 like
 what
 what


do
 you want
 to
 do
 in
 five
 years?
 I'm


thinking
 about
 starting
 my
 own
 company


actually
 in
 six
 months
 you
 know
 but
 I'll


work
 at
 data
 bricks
 for
 10
 years
 but
 in


six
 months
 I
 would
 love
 to
 be
 a
 CEO.
 So


then
 you
 can
 say
 hey
 I
 can
 coach
 you
 to


uh
 you
 know
 I
 I
 know
 how
 the
 fundraising


I
 know
 the
 early
 days
 and
 so
 on
 and
 you


can
 actually
 mentor
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 and


that's
 actually
 worth
 a
 lot
 to
 them
 as


well.
 Uh
 but
 in
 general
 like
 help
 them


be
 successful
 and
 help
 them
 build
 their


careers
 and
 also
 if
 you've
 done
 it


before
 like
 we
 have
 um
 you
 can
 kind
 of


calm
 them
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 say
 hey


you
 have
 like
 few
 decades
 you
 know
 don't


worry
 about
 it
 it's
 like
 it's
 not
 uh
 you


know
 it's
 the
 FOMO
 uh
 and
 the
 pressure


you
 know
 has
 to
 be
 uh
 kind
 of
 reduced


and
 I
 think
 that's
 also
 calming
 they


feel
 good
 about
 it.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 always
 say
 the
 best
 cure


for
 starting
 your
 own
 company
 fever
 is


to
 start
 your
 own
 company
 and
 that'll


teach
 you.


>> It's
 not
 that
 easy.


>> By
 the
 way,
 they
 come
 back
 like
 after


start
 companies
 often
 times
 they
 come


back
 to
 data
 bricks
 and
 they're
 much


more
 thankful
 and
 you
 understand
 and


actually
 I
 didn't
 mention
 this
 earlier


when
 you
 asked
 about
 acquisitions.
 My


favorite
 acquisition
 uh
 because
 I
 said


they
 start
 with
 the
 people,
 right?
 and


then
 the
 product
 and
 with
 the
 people
 I


love
 to
 hire
 people
 who
 have
 seen
 great


at
 a
 big
 company
 like
 or
 I
 don't
 know if


it's
 great
 but
 they've
 seen
 process


scale
 big
 company
 they've
 been
 at
 a


Google
 they've
 been
 at
 Amazon
 they


understand
 the
 processes
 so
 that
 I


understand
 how
 to
 navigate
 a
 bureaucracy


and
 work
 with
 it
 and
 they're
 not
 going


to
 just
 be
 inundated
 by
 it
 but
 then


they've
 gone
 on
 and
 done
 their
 own


startup
 and
 um
 and
 that's
 really
 really


hard
 right
 it's
 like
 it's
 like
 extremely


hard
 uh
 trying
 to
 do
 everything
 yourself


and
 you
 don't
 have
 any
 help
 and
 you
 know


you're
 trying
 to
 do
 this
 in
 this
 crazy


market
 and
 you're
 trying
 to
 compete
 with


hundred
 million
 dollar
 offers
 when
 you


have
 like
 nothing.
 Um,
 so
 that
 takes
 a


certain
 amount
 of
 grit
 and
 it's
 really


humbling.
 Uh,
 so
 I
 love
 the
 people
 that


have
 done
 both
 of
 those.
 They
 end
 up


being
 actually
 the
 perfect
 employees
 at


databicks
 because
 they
 come
 in
 and


they're
 really
 thankful.
 They're
 like,


"Hey,
 what
 these
 guys
 have
 done
 at


databick
 is
 actually
 really
 really
 hard.


I
 tried
 it
 and
 I'm
 really
 good.
 I
 was


like
 one
 of
 the
 best
 at
 Google
 or


somewhere
 and
 then
 I
 did
 my
 own
 startup


and
 we
 absolutely
 failed
 and
 so
 hey
 show


some
 respect
 here
 like
 you
 know
 these


guys
 know
 what
 they're
 talking
 about."


So
 those
 are
 great
 employees
 actually.


So,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 uh
 keep
 a
 great


relationship
 with
 people
 who
 leave
 your


company
 cuz
 they'll
 they
 can
 boomerang


back
 in
 a
 couple
 years.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 look,
 it's
 it's
 very


hard
 to
 make
 these
 things
 work.


>> Um
 and
 and
 you
 it
 also
 requires
 a
 lot
 of


luck.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 one
 of the
 things


people
 don't
 realize
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 things


have
 to
 go
 right
 that
 should
 never
 go


right.


>> Um
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 will
 go
 wrong,


but
 like
 if
 you
 can
 grab
 your
 lucky


moments,
 that's
 a
 rare
 that's
 a
 rare


thing.


>> Yeah.
 One
 one
 way
 to
 prove
 that
 is
 if


datab
 data
 started
 in
 2013


>> if
 we
 had
 started
 in
 2012
 you
 know
 that


rocky
 year
 that
 difficult
 year
 2015


would
 have
 then
 happened
 in
 2014


>> right
 to
 start
 the
 funds
 are
 we
 not
 we


don't
 have
 the
 revenue
 but
 we
 were
 a


cloud
 AI
 open
 source
 company
 uh
 those


things
 didn't
 take
 off
 in
 2014
 so


>> you
 know
 even
 if
 like
 if
 we
 had
 to
 do


the
 CEO
 change
 and
 all
 of
 that
 and
 I
 had


become
 CEO
 a
 year
 earlier
 it
 just
 we


were
 too
 early
 in
 the
 market
 the
 cloud


hadn't
 taken
 off
 AI
 was
 not
 nobody
 that


was
 not
 even
 a
 phrase
 AI
 meant
 robotics.


People
 use
 machine
 learning
 as
 the


phrase
 and
 uh
 so
 company
 would
 have


failed.
 We
 wouldn't
 have
 had
 enough


momentum.
 There's
 not
 enough
 cloud,
 you


know,
 TAM
 there
 to
 be
 had.


>> If
 we
 started
 the
 company
 in
 2014,
 a


year
 later
 instead,
 so
 a
 year
 later
 than


we
 actually
 did,
 then
 uh
 we
 would
 have


had
 our
 difficult
 year
 in
 2016.


>> But
 by
 2016,
 the
 cloud
 was
 starting
 to


happen,
 AI
 was
 starting
 to
 happen,
 you


know,
 so
 we
 would
 have
 done
 the
 fixes
 in


2017
 and
 it
 would
 have
 been
 too
 late
 to


late
 to
 the
 party
 and
 probably
 the


hyperscalers
 would
 have
 taken
 it
 away.


you
 know,
 our
 competitors
 were
 taking
 it


away
 and
 we
 were
 just
 wouldn't
 have
 get


enough
 momentum
 to
 be
 able
 to
 succeed


and
 that's
 timing
 of
 when
 we
 started.


So,
 how
 did
 we
 clock
 it
 so
 well?
 Uh,
 we


had
 to
 wait
 for
 Mate
 to
 finish
 his
 PhD


thesis.
 That's
 it.


>> Yeah,
 that
 that
 you
 know
 that
 that
 was


the
 whole
 thing.


>> So,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 randomness.
 Uh,
 and


you
 got
 to
 get
 lucky.
 and
 and and
 it
 was


so
 on
 the
 edge
 as
 it
 was
 that
 on
 the


series
 C
 um
 Yan
 had
 a
 handshake
 with
 the


Redpoint
 with
 Redpoint
 and
 Redpoint
 just


stopped
 returning
 his
 calls
 to
 the
 point


where
 the
 series
 C
 was
 led
 by
 us
 who


also
 led
 the
 series
 A
 and
 uh
 NEA
 who
 led


the
 series
 B
 like
 we
 co-led
 the
 series
 C


because
 nobody
 else
 would
 do
 it.
 I
 mean


it
 was
 that
 it
 was
 that


>> close
 to
 going
 under
 and
 most
 companies


weren't
 even
 right
 that
 would
 be
 it.


>> Yeah,
 it
 was
 very
 close
 because
 we


couldn't
 get
 funding
 for
 anyone.
 It's


just
 funding
 freezed
 up
 and
 nobody


wanted
 to
 invest
 anymore.
 So
 it
 was


really
 a
 lifeline
 uh
 from
 A&Z.


>> Yeah.
 We
 were
 just
 you
 know
 burning
 a


lot
 of
 cash.
 We
 weren't
 generating
 much


revenue
 other
 than
 Spark
 Summit.


>> We
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 downloads.
 We
 had
 a
 lot


of
 downloads.


>> A
 lot
 of
 downloads


>> and
 recurring
 conference
 revenue.


>> Yeah.
 and
 recurring.


>> How
 confident
 were
 you
 in
 that
 time
 when


when
 things
 were
 at
 their
 level?


>> Oh,
 I
 mean
 I
 seriously
 considered
 taking


the
 professor
 job
 at
 Berkeley
 because
 uh


I
 you
 know
 I
 seriously
 thought
 this
 was


going
 to
 be
 very
 very
 hard
 to
 pull
 off.


Um
 you
 know
 it's
 like
 you
 know
 I
 think


the
 sentiment
 at
 data
 bricks
 was
 or
 at


least
 my
 sentiment
 was
 uh
 look
 you
 you


win
 some
 things
 you
 lose
 some
 things
 in


life.
 We
 created
 Apache
 Spark
 and
 we


made
 it
 a
 worldwide
 sensation.


Everybody's
 downloading
 the
 downloads


are
 through
 the
 roof.
 We
 have
 this


greatest
 conference
 like
 you
 know


thousands
 of
 people
 come
 to
 our


conference.
 It's
 awesome.
 Let's
 go
 back.


Let's
 do
 it
 again.
 Let's
 publish
 another


paper
 and
 do
 those
 kind
 of
 things.
 We're


just
 not
 business
 guys.
 We
 just
 don't


understand
 business.
 You
 know,
 that's


okay.
 You
 know,
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 be


business
 guys.
 So,
 uh
 so
 that's
 kind
 of


how
 I
 felt
 about
 it,
 right?
 Uh
 but
 uh


what
 I
 knew
 was
 that
 hey,
 um
 you
 know,


>> by
 the
 way,
 every
 mate
 went
 back
 and


became
 a
 professor.
 Like
 all
 all
 this


stuff
 happened.


>> Yeah.
 Yan
 went
 back,
 you
 know,
 and
 um


but
 uh
 you
 know,
 in
 2015,


>> we
 knew
 that
 we
 had
 tried
 everything.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 PLG
 is
 something
 that
 we


had
 tried
 very
 hard
 and
 it
 didn't
 work


for
 us.


>> Like
 you
 know,
 actually
 one
 of
 our


biggest
 failures
 was
 PLG
 at
 data
 bricks.


Everybody
 kept
 telling
 us
 PLG,
 PLG,
 PLG.


And
 we're
 like,
 okay,
 product
 growth
 and


Amazon
 didn't
 just
 swipe
 their
 credit


cards.
 We
 don't
 need
 sales
 people.
 Um


but
 so
 in
 2015,
 I
 had
 kind
 of
 like


>> Except
 Cranny.


>> Exactly.
 Yes,
 that
 is
 true.
 Uh
 kudos
 to


Mark.
 So
 that
 year
 we
 had
 like
 formed


some
 hypothesis
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 have


nothing
 to
 lose.
 Uh
 what
 if
 we
 just


pivoted
 these
 things?
 What
 if
 we
 went


all
 in
 into
 B2B
 enterprise
 sales
 you


know
 cuz
 certainly
 it's
 not
 PLG
 is
 not


working
 you
 know
 at
 3
 million
 AR
 that's


not
 going
 to
 take
 you
 anywhere.
 Um
 and


you
 know
 and
 they're
 just
 taking
 our


open
 source
 software
 so
 we
 have
 to
 have


proprietary
 code
 around
 it
 you
 know
 and


yeah
 the
 execs
 team
 are
 all
 PhDs
 you


know.
 So
 what
 if
 we
 bring
 in
 someone


that
 doesn't
 have
 a
 PhD
 and
 see
 how
 it


goes.
 So,
 so


>> I
 never
 forget
 Arcelon
 going,
 "We
 made


the
 number."
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "You
 made
 a


ridiculous
 number."
 Like,
 you
 made
 the


number.
 Like,
 if
 you
 keep
 making
 that


number,
 you're
 going to
 go
 bankrupt.


Like,
 that
 you
 didn't
 make
 the
 number.


You
 made
 a
 number
 that
 you
 set
 that
 was


way
 too
 low.
 Like,
 we
 haven't
 figured
 it


out.


>> Ben
 was
 very
 nice
 and
 complimentary
 in


our
 board
 meetings
 that
 year,
 2015.
 You


know,


>> we
 were
 Yeah,
 we
 we
 were
 in
 a
 bit
 of


trouble.


>> Let's
 say
 it
 was
 very
 truthing.
 Uh,
 but


uh
 but
 yeah,
 so
 we
 had
 nothing
 to
 lose.


So
 we
 didn't
 know
 that
 we
 were
 going
 to


succeed,
 but
 we
 had
 nothing
 to
 lose
 to


make
 those
 big
 changes
 and
 we
 made
 them


in
 2016.
 And
 it
 turned
 out
 those
 were


the
 bottlenecks.
 You
 know,
 giving
 away


your
 software
 for
 free.
 Uh
 not
 having


execs
 that
 have
 seen
 the
 movie
 before


like
 Ron
 who
 came
 in
 and
 um
 you
 know
 um


just
 uh
 the
 PLG
 motion
 is
 not
 going
 to


cut
 it.
 So
 maybe
 we
 should
 just
 try.
 We


weren't
 certain
 that
 B2B
 would
 work,
 but


we
 knew
 that
 PLG
 is
 not
 working
 for


sure.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 another
 like
 I
 mean
 you
 know


we
 got
 Ron


I
 mean
 like
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 first


sales
 guy
 we
 hired
 was
 a
 sales
 savant


like
 a
 genius.
 Shock.
 I
 mean
 like
 that


never
 happens.
 And
 and
 he
 was
 a
 guy
 we


didn't
 know.
 Like
 we
 like
 our
 talent


team
 like
 found
 him
 some
 from
 some


company
 we
 never
 heard
 of.


>> Yeah.
 French
 company.
 And
 the
 only


>> really
 the
 only
 reason
 we
 hired
 him
 was


because
 he
 was
 the
 only
 guy
 Cranny
 ever


liked.
 Like
 in
 all
 the
 sales
 guys
 he


ever
 interviewed,
 he
 was
 like
 this
 is


the
 guy.


>> Wow.


>> And


>> yeah,
 he
 he
 is
 a
 new
 generation
 more
 cr


but
 we
 just
 like
 stumbled
 into
 him.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Like
 unbelievable.
 And


>> without
 Ron


>> very
 hard
 to
 see
 us
 this
 company
 getting


to
 where
 it
 got
 to.


>> So
 there's
 some
 luck
 involved
 in
 us
 even


finding
 him.
 Uh
 but
 then
 that
 he
 was


phenomenal
 and
 also
 kudos
 to
 Yan
 who


actually
 led
 the
 search
 in
 2015.
 Uh
 so


you
 know
 um
 but
 uh
 yeah
 Ron
 was
 game


changing
 for
 us
 but
 Ron
 was
 a
 very


uncomfortable
 uh
 hire


>> because
 he
 did
 not
 have
 a
 PhD


>> and
 uh
 he


>> did
 have
 an
 engineering
 degree.
 Yeah,
 he


does
 have
 an
 engineering
 degree
 from


Stanford
 that
 helped
 a
 little
 bit,
 but


uh
 but
 he's
 he's
 a
 sales,
 you
 know,
 true


and
 true
 sales
 guy
 like
 he's
 not
 a,
 you


know,
 he's
 not
 one
 of
 these
 he's
 he's
 a


classic
 sales
 person,
 right?
 Who
 grew
 up


in
 sales
 um
 even
 though
 he
 has
 an


engineering
 degree.
 So,
 um
 the


comfortable
 thing
 would
 have
 been
 to


pick
 someone
 and
 we
 had
 some
 candidates


in
 the
 mix
 who
 were
 super
 technical


using
 the
 product,
 giving
 us
 feedback,


but
 they
 probably
 would
 not
 and
 that


would
 have
 been
 much
 more
 comfortable


for
 us.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh


>> yeah,
 Ron
 was
 uncomfortable.
 He
 was
 a


very
 uncomfortable
 hireer
 and
 he
 made
 it


very
 uncomfortable
 for
 us
 for
 many
 years


and
 he
 still
 does.


>> But
 that's
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 key
 to
 the


company.


>> Yeah.


>> Is
 it
 forces


it
 forces
 a
 customer
 focus
 that
 would
 be


impossible
 to
 have
 without
 somebody
 that


smart
 and
 crafty


>> about
 getting
 his
 way.
 I
 mean
 just
 like


unbelievable.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> If
 you
 can
 keep
 also
 the
 original
 team


together
 that's
 important.
 We
 were,
 you


know,
 seven
 co-founders
 still.
 Many
 of


the
 co-founders
 like,
 you
 know,
 you
 said


data
 warehousing
 was
 a
 big
 push
 for
 us.


My
 co-founder
 Reynold
 was
 really
 the
 one


that
 kind
 of
 pushed
 this.


>> Yeah.
 Like,
 well,
 the
 the
 contribution


level
 from
 a
 large
 number
 of
 co-founders


is
 unique
 in
 the
 industry.
 I
 mean,


you've
 got
 Patrick,
 you
 have
 Rainald,


you
 have
 Mate,
 you
 have
 Arcelon.
 I
 mean,


like,
 it's
 it's
 crazy
 how
 much


>> the
 original
 team
 contributes.


>> Yeah.
 So
 the
 PhDs
 all
 contribute
 like


Arson
 really
 made
 the
 go
 to
 market
 work


you
 know
 and
 he
 really
 made
 the
 sort
 of


Ron
 work
 with
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 company


that
 was
 super
 critical
 mate
 continued


doing
 lots
 of
 innovations
 over
 the
 years


Patrick
 led
 all
 of
 engineering
 in
 big


chunks
 of
 it
 and
 you
 know
 so
 on
 and


we've
 had
 other
 people
 we've
 been
 lucky


to
 get
 such
 folks
 so
 hiring
 is
 critical


and
 keeping
 the
 original
 talent
 I
 think


those
 were
 some
 of
 the
 things


>> yeah
 usually
 founders


usually
 only
 one
 of
 the
 co-founders


contributes
 long
 term
 and
 so
 to
 have


you
 know
 to
 have
 that
 going
 and
 Yan's


still
 on
 the
 board
 and
 Scott's
 still
 on


the
 board.
 I
 mean,
 like,
 it's
 very


unusual.


>> Yeah,
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 more
 we
 can
 get


into,
 but
 we're
 at
 time,
 so
 we'll
 leave


it
 for
 future
 episodes
 of
 Boss
 Talk,
 but


this
 is
 a
 great
 first
 episode.


>> All
 right,
 that
 was
 fun.
 Thanks
 so
 much.


Thank
 you
 so
 much,
 guys.
