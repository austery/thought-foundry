Hello
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 November
 1st


and
 this
 is
 Markets
 Weekly.
 So
 this
 past


week,
 super
 exciting
 week
 in
 the


markets.
 We
 had
 the
 Fed
 meeting.
 Uh


there's
 a
 video
 about
 that
 on
 the


channel
 and
 of
 course
 we
 had
 Trump's


tour
 in
 Asia
 as
 well
 as
 Max
 7
 earnings.


Now
 Meta
 disappointed
 the
 market
 was


down
 a
 lot,
 but
 everyone
 else
 was
 okay.


Amazon
 notably
 up
 10%
 after
 earnings.
 So


the
 broad
 markets
 I
 think
 were
 overall


mixed.
 Today,
 let's
 talk
 about
 three


things.
 First
 off,
 let's
 briefly
 review


what
 happened
 with
 the
 president's
 trip


in
 Asia,
 where
 we
 got
 more
 details
 about


the
 big
 investment
 deals
 Japan
 and
 Korea


had
 promised
 the
 president.
 Secondly,


the
 World
 Gold
 Council
 released
 their


latest
 report
 on
 the
 supply
 and
 demand


factors
 driving
 gold
 prices
 higher.
 So,


let's
 take
 a
 look
 at
 that.
 And
 lastly,


there's
 brand
 new
 research
 from
 the


Federal
 Reserve
 on
 the
 impact
 of
 tariffs


on
 US
 manufacturing.
 And
 so
 far
 it's
 not


positive.
 Uh
 but
 maybe
 we
 can
 find
 out


why.
 All
 right,
 starting
 with
 the


president's
 trip
 in
 Asia.
 So
 let's
 level


it
 a
 little
 bit.
 Over
 the
 past
 few


months,
 again,
 a
 lot
 of
 trade
 headlines.


The
 president
 sought
 to
 renegotiate
 the


US's
 trade
 relationships
 with
 the
 world.


Now,
 what
 we
 found
 out
 after
 all
 this


excitement
 was
 that
 the
 US
 for
 the
 most


part
 has
 much
 more
 leverage
 over
 other


countries
 than
 previously
 thought.
 In


particular,
 uh,
 countries
 like
 Japan,


South
 Korea,
 Taiwan,
 uh,
 European
 Union


need
 the
 US
 for
 defense
 and
 also
 need


access
 to
 US
 markets.
 So,
 the
 US
 was


able
 to
 extract
 significant
 concessions


from
 them.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 Japan
 and


Korea,
 in
 order
 to
 buy
 down
 their


tariffs,
 they
 were
 willing
 to
 make
 huge


investment
 into
 the
 United
 States.
 The


way
 that
 I
 look
 at
 this
 is
 that
 over
 the


past
 few
 decades,
 these
 countries
 have


been
 making
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 money
 off


global
 trade,
 accumulating
 large
 foreign


exchange
 surpluses,
 and
 the
 president
 is


basically
 taking
 all
 that
 back
 by


forcing
 them
 to
 invest
 in
 the
 US.
 Now,


the
 one
 exception
 in
 all
 this,
 of


course,
 is
 China,
 which
 we
 found
 out


that
 the
 Chinese
 are
 very
 strong.
 They


have
 something
 rare
 earths
 that
 the
 US


absolutely
 needs,
 and
 of
 course,
 they


have
 a
 much
 higher
 pain
 tolerance.
 So
 in


a
 sense,
 China
 probably
 stronger
 than


the
 US
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 trade
 deal.


So
 over
 and
 over
 again,
 we
 have
 what


appears
 to
 be
 uh
 the
 White
 House


reaching
 out
 to
 China,
 well
 doing


something
 strong
 and
 then
 reaching
 out


to
 China
 to
 try
 to
 climb
 down
 and
 uh


that
 seemed
 to
 happen
 this
 time
 as
 well.


Now
 the
 reaction
 the
 president
 received


in
 Asia
 was
 of
 course
 mixed.
 On
 the
 one


hand,
 we
 have
 the
 president's
 meeting


with
 the
 new
 prime
 minister
 of
 Japan.


Let's
 take
 a
 look.
 the
 first
 female


prime
 minister
 in
 the
 history
 of
 Japan.


Madame
 Prime
 Minister,


>> looks
 like
 she
 really
 likes
 him,
 right?


They're
 having
 a
 good
 time.
 So,
 we
 have


a
 bit
 more
 detail
 about
 Japan's
 $550


billion
 commitment
 to
 invest
 in
 the
 US.


According
 to
 a
 the
 memorandum
 overview


released
 on
 the
 White
 House's
 website,


about
 330
 billion
 of
 that
 will
 be
 in
 US


power
 infrastructure.
 So
 nuclear


reactors,
 power
 substations,
 turbines,


and
 so
 forth.
 And
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 in


cooperation
 with
 US
 companies.
 So
 what


this
 looks
 like
 to
 me
 is
 that
 the
 US
 is


trying
 to
 get
 uh
 trying
 to
 use
 Japan's


help
 to
 build
 up
 US
 expertise


and
 is
 also
 concerned
 about
 the


electricity
 demands
 of
 AI
 going
 forward.


So
 in
 a
 sense,
 they're
 trying
 to


basically
 with
 Japan's
 help
 uh
 rebuild


some
 of
 the
 US's
 infrastructure.
 So
 that


seems
 like
 a
 really
 good
 idea.
 U
 when
 it


comes
 to
 South
 Korea,
 also
 very
 good


reception.
 The
 South
 Korean
 president


gave
 the
 president
 a
 uh
 gold
 crown,


literally
 a
 gold
 crown
 and
 um
 promised


to
 make
 $350
 billion
 in
 investments
 in


the
 US
 largely
 in
 technology.
 However,


Japan
 um
 I
 mean
 South
 Korea
 does
 not


have
 as
 much
 cash
 as
 Japan.
 So
 they're


on
 a
 schedule
 where
 they
 saying
 they're


going
 to
 disperse
 uh
 20
 billion
 a
 year.


It's
 going
 to
 take
 some
 time,
 but
 of


course
 better
 than
 nothing.
 Now
 there's


some


commentary
 that
 maybe
 this
 is
 all
 fake


and
 so
 forth,
 but
 you
 know,
 Japan
 in


particular
 usually
 very
 good,
 reliable,


and
 um
 honest
 uh
 allies.
 So


don't
 see
 why
 they
 wouldn't
 follow


through
 on
 their
 commitment,
 at least


through
 the
 Trump
 administration.
 Same


for
 uh
 South
 Korea.
 Now,
 when
 it
 comes


to
 China,
 I
 think
 the
 president
 got
 a


little
 bit
 different
 reception.
 Let's


take
 a
 look.


>> Good
 to
 meet
 you.


>> Great
 pleasure
 to
 see
 you
 again.


>> Good
 to
 see
 you
 again.


>> Me,
 too.


>> And
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 very


successful
 meeting.
 I
 have
 no
 doubt.


>> But
 he's
 a
 very
 tough
 negotiator.
 That's


not
 good.


we
 know
 each
 other
 well.


>> So,
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 president
 is


overjoyed
 to
 meet
 Uncle
 Xi,
 but
 you


know,
 Uncle
 Xi
 is
 like,
 "Yeah,


whatever."
 And
 this
 kind
 of
 shows
 in


what
 actually
 happened
 in
 the
 in
 the


negotiations.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 uh


the
 president
 lowered
 tariffs
 on
 China


by
 10%
 essentially
 reducing
 the
 fentinol


tariffs
 on
 China
 and
 exchange
 got
 a


commitment
 to
 purchase
 more
 soybeans
 and


to
 look
 more
 into


uh
 the
 production
 of
 fentinel
 precursors


and
 a
 one-year
 pause
 in
 implementation


of
 uh
 rare
 earth
 the
 new
 rare
 earth


regime
 that
 they
 could
 potentially
 use


to
 control
 the
 supply
 of
 rare
 earths
 to


the
 world.
 So
 overall,
 it
 seems
 like
 uh


both
 countries,
 you
 know,
 got
 to
 uh


extend
 this
 truce.
 There's
 stuff
 about


port
 fees
 and
 so
 forth,
 but
 you
 know,


you
 you
 seem
 it
 seems
 to
 me
 that
 with
 a


10%
 reduction
 in
 tariffs,
 it
 was
 of


course
 the
 Chinese
 that
 had
 the
 stronger


negotiating
 hand
 and
 walked
 away
 with


probably
 a
 better
 deal.
 But
 hey,
 the


markets
 liked
 it.
 We
 front front
 ran


that
 over
 uh
 throughout
 the
 week.
 And
 if


you
 look
 at
 soybean
 futures,
 the
 soybean


farmers
 of
 America
 are
 rejoicing
 because


now
 they
 have
 uh
 someone
 to
 buy
 their


soybeans.
 So
 things
 seems
 to
 have
 worked


out
 for
 uh
 to
 some
 extent
 everyone.
 And


I
 think
 that
 probably
 concludes
 all
 this


trade
 negotiations
 for
 for
 some
 time.
 So


uh
 let's
 move
 on
 to
 the
 next
 topic
 which


of
 course
 is
 the
 latest
 report
 from
 the


world
 gold
 council.
 Now,
 this
 past
 year,


gold
 has
 been
 one
 of
 the
 top
 performing


assets.
 We
 did
 have
 a
 notable
 tumble
 the


past
 few
 weeks,
 which
 we've
 been
 talking


about.
 But
 I
 think
 it's
 interesting
 that


the
 World
 Gold
 Council
 here
 has
 this


report
 breaking
 down
 more
 concretely
 the


supply
 and
 demand
 factors
 that
 have
 been


driving
 gold
 prices
 up
 almost
 40%
 this


year.
 Now,
 obviously
 though,
 just
 to
 be


clear,
 the
 biggest
 driver
 is
 increased


demand
 in
 investments,
 but
 let's
 go
 over


uh
 the
 few
 of
 them
 listed
 here.
 Now,


first
 off,
 where
 do
 what
 are
 the
 basic


demand
 drivers
 of
 gold?
 The
 most
 obvious


one,
 of
 course,
 is
 jewelry.
 Before
 we


had
 all
 this,
 you
 know,
 dalization,


debasement,
 all
 that
 stuff.
 Gold
 for


most
 for
 most
 people
 is
 something
 that


they
 use
 in
 jewelry.
 Now,
 jewelry
 of


course
 is
 going
 to
 be
 more
 price


sensitive.
 So,
 over
 the
 past
 year,
 as


gold
 prices
 have
 surged,
 we
 see
 jewelry


demand
 falling.


So,
 that's
 no
 surprise,
 right?
 Things


are
 more
 expensive,
 you
 buy
 less
 of
 it.


Basically,
 it
 seems
 like
 demand
 for


jewelry
 has
 been
 crowded
 out
 by
 other


demands.
 The
 biggest
 driver
 in
 demand


over
 the
 past
 year
 has
 been
 in


investments
 and
 investment
 demand
 in


gold
 comes
 in
 two
 forms.
 One
 is
 through


ETFs.
 So,
 if
 you
 buy
 the
 GLD
 ETF,
 for


example,
 the
 ETF
 actually
 goes
 and
 buys


physical
 gold.
 So,
 it's
 not
 purely


paper.
 The
 second
 source
 of
 demand
 is
 of


course
 just
 more
 traditional
 coins
 and


bullion.
 Now
 if
 you
 look
 at
 ETF
 demand


for
 gold,
 it's
 been
 absolutely
 surging.


So
 ETF
 uh
 gold
 ETFs
 are
 global.
 It's
 not


just
 JLD.
 There's
 actually
 a
 few
 in
 the


US
 and
 there's
 also
 a
 gold
 ETFs
 abroad


as
 well.
 And
 that
 source
 has
 been
 a
 very


big
 driver
 in
 the
 gold
 price
 going


forward.
 But
 if
 you
 look
 at
 more
 just


physical
 demand
 coin
 and
 bullion,
 it's


also
 held
 up
 pretty
 well
 as
 well.


Now
 a
 second
 often
 cited
 narrative
 for


gold
 demand
 is
 central
 bank
 buying.
 Now


we've
 all
 seen
 many
 charts
 where
 people


say
 that
 central
 bank
 holdings
 of
 gold


have
 actually
 uh
 grown
 more
 than


treasuries.
 But
 that's
 super
 super
 mis


uh
 misleading
 because
 yes
 the
 central


banks
 are
 buying
 more
 gold
 but
 the


reason
 that
 their
 gold
 holdings
 look


bigger
 in
 dollar
 terms
 has
 largely
 been


because
 of
 price
 appreciation.


So,
 central
 banks
 are
 buying
 gold.
 Yes.


But
 that
 huge
 growth
 in
 their
 gold


holdings
 largely
 through
 price


appreciation.
 Now,
 looking
 at
 this
 chart


from
 the
 World
 Gold
 Council,
 what's


interesting
 is
 that
 gold
 demanded
 by


central
 banks
 is
 actually
 lower
 this


year
 than
 the
 last
 year.
 To
 be
 clear,


it's
 it's
 still
 historically
 pretty


elevated,
 but
 it
 is
 lower
 this
 year
 than


compared
 to
 last
 year.
 They
 have
 a
 very


interesting
 chart
 finding
 which
 central


banks
 have
 the
 largest
 demand
 for
 gold.


And
 surprising
 to
 me,
 it's
 actually
 the


Polish
 central
 bank
 that
 has
 the
 most


demand
 for
 for
 gold
 uh
 this
 year.
 So,


pretty
 interesting
 uh
 Rinko.
 You'd
 think


it
 would
 be
 someone
 like
 China,
 but


actually
 it's
 it's
 not.
 Um
 looking


moving
 over
 to
 the
 supply
 of
 gold,
 it


looks
 like
 the
 supply
 from
 mines
 has


been
 pretty
 elevated
 over
 the
 past
 few


years,
 but
 of
 course
 mining
 supply
 of


gold
 is
 full
 of
 uh
 randomness.
 You
 have


accidents
 and
 so
 forth.
 And
 of
 course


you
 do
 have
 some
 mines
 that
 continue
 to


come
 online.
 What
 I
 find
 interesting


about
 this
 report
 though
 is
 its
 report


on
 the
 supply
 of
 uh
 recycled
 gold
 or


scrap
 gold.
 So
 one
 of the
 things
 that
 I


remember
 back
 in
 the
 last
 gold
 rush


after
 the
 great
 financial
 crisis
 is
 that


when
 the
 gold
 price
 became
 elevated,
 you


had
 all
 these
 businesses
 sprouting
 out


sprouting
 out
 across
 the
 country
 saying


we
 buy
 gold.
 And
 what
 was
 happening
 was


that
 the
 general
 public
 was
 seeing
 that


gold
 prices
 have
 become
 so
 elevated
 they


were
 rushing
 to
 sell
 their
 gold
 like


their
 jewelry
 or
 their
 family
 heirlooms


or
 whatnot
 uh
 to
 cash
 out.
 Of
 course,


what's
 implicit
 in
 that
 of
 course
 is


that
 they're
 thinking
 that
 the
 gold


prices
 had
 gone
 too
 high
 and
 they
 want


to
 uh
 capture
 some
 cash.
 So,
 so
 far


though,
 even
 as
 gold
 prices
 remain


elevated,
 uh
 the
 supply
 of
 recycled
 gold


is,
 you
 know,
 hasn't
 really
 jumped.
 So,


the
 reports
 seem
 to
 view
 that
 as
 some


potential
 that
 u
 maybe
 the
 retail
 public


thinks
 that
 the
 gold
 price
 is
 not
 could


could
 still
 go
 higher
 because
 if
 you


thought
 it
 wouldn't
 go
 any
 higher


higher,
 you
 would
 go
 and
 you
 would
 be


selling
 your
 own
 gold.
 So,
 uh
 so
 far


looking
 at
 the
 price
 chart,
 we
 do
 seem


to
 be
 consolidating
 and
 so
 let's
 see


what
 happens.
 Usually
 it
 takes
 a
 bit


more
 time
 after
 we've
 had
 such
 a
 big


tumble.
 All
 right,
 the
 last
 thing
 I
 want


to
 talk
 about
 is
 this
 interesting


research
 from
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 about


the
 president's
 uh
 impact
 of
 the


president's
 tariffs
 on
 US
 manufacturing.


So
 the
 big
 picture
 of
 course
 is
 that
 the


president
 would
 like
 to
 revitalize
 US


manufacturing.
 There's
 some
 very
 good


reasons
 for
 that.
 national
 security
 of


course
 can
 be
 relied
 upon
 other
 people


for
 for
 lots
 of
 our
 goods
 but
 also
 it


creates
 jobs
 right
 so
 that's
 some


there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 loss
 of
 uh
 blue


collar
 jobs
 in
 the
 US
 and
 the
 president


would
 like
 to
 help
 those
 people
 out
 the


way
 that
 he's
 doing
 this
 one
 it's


multi-prong
 imposing
 tariffs
 to
 make


imports
 more
 expensive
 a
 lot
 of


subsidies
 through
 the
 OBBA
 and
 of
 course


the
 dollar
 has
 been
 weakening
 so
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 complicated
 puzzle
 and


they're
 trying
 to
 solve
 it.
 So,
 how
 are


they
 doing
 so
 far?
 Well,
 first
 off,
 we


should
 be
 clear.
 Uh
 the
 likelihood
 of
 a


company
 looking
 at
 all
 this
 policy


change
 and
 immediately
 building
 a
 new


factory
 is
 not
 high
 because
 when
 you


build
 a
 factory,
 it
 takes
 a
 lot
 of


money.
 It
 takes
 many
 years.
 And
 as
 we


all
 know,
 there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 policy


certainty.
 Maybe
 we
 get
 a
 new
 president


in
 a
 few
 years.
 Maybe
 Zora
 Mandame
 or


AOC
 comes
 online,
 becomes
 the
 president,


and
 then
 we
 take
 all
 these
 tariffs
 out.


then
 you
 know
 your
 multi-billion
 dollar


factory
 that
 was
 built
 with
 u
 with
 the


view
 that
 tariffs
 would
 make
 domestic


production
 attractive
 just
 just
 doesn't


work
 anymore.
 But
 what
 tariffs
 could


immediately
 impact
 though
 is
 existing


capacity.
 That
 is
 to
 say
 that
 tariffs
 go


up
 and
 immediately
 imports
 become
 more


expensive
 relative
 to
 domestically


produced
 stuff.
 And
 so
 there's
 a
 good


argument
 that
 factories
 that
 are
 already


in
 the
 US
 uh
 could
 become
 busier.
 And


there
 are
 some
 stories
 and
 major


publications
 about
 this.
 But
 the
 data


that
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 presents
 shows


a
 slightly
 different
 picture.
 First
 off


that
 they
 find
 is
 that
 manufacturing


capacity
 in
 the
 US
 is
 uh
 is
 you
 know
 a


bit
 low.
 So
 they
 definitely
 have
 a
 lot


of
 excess
 capacity.
 Whereas
 if
 there
 was


a
 surge
 in
 demand
 these
 factories
 could


definitely
 ramp
 up.
 Now
 the
 question
 is


that
 are
 these
 now
 manufacturing
 is
 a


very
 broad
 field
 and
 the
 presence


protections
 extend
 unevenly
 right
 huge


protections
 in
 aluminum
 in
 steel
 and
 so


forth
 but
 other
 other
 fac
 other
 factor


other
 fields
 not
 as
 protected.
 So
 what


the
 researchers
 did
 is
 according
 to


industry
 code
 they
 tried
 to
 figure
 out
 a


measure
 of
 how
 protected
 this
 industry


is
 and
 then
 find
 whether
 or
 not
 there's


a
 relationship
 between
 changes
 in


industrial
 capacity
 and
 changes
 in
 how


protected
 uh
 the
 industry
 is.
 The


thinking
 was
 that
 over
 the
 past
 few


months
 as
 protection
 for
 one
 industry


increases
 maybe
 there
 will
 be
 uh


increase
 in
 their
 um
 oh
 so
 increase
 in


their
 factory
 utilization.
 So
 they'd


have
 less
 capacity,
 right?
 Because


they're
 utilizing
 it
 more.
 Now
 they
 run


this
 regression
 and
 what
 they
 find
 is


according
 to
 this
 chart
 there
 is
 no


relationship.
 So
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 um


it's
 been
 these
 tariffs
 have
 been


helping
 u
 existing
 factories
 become


busier.
 Well,
 that's
 kind
 of
 a
 head


scratcher,
 right?
 Immediately
 a
 lot
 of


imports
 become
 more
 expensive.
 Why


haven't
 these
 domestic
 uh
 manufacturers


become
 a
 little
 bit
 busier
 in


superprotected
 sectors
 of
 the
 market?
 So


they
 take
 a
 step
 forward
 and
 they
 look


at
 a
 survey
 that
 asks
 these
 companies


why
 is
 your
 factory
 utilization


relatively
 low
 and
 this
 is
 what
 they


found.
 It's
 actually
 super
 interesting.


Now
 according
 to
 what
 they
 found
 is
 that


the
 more
 protected
 industries
 actually


have
 uh
 more
 oftenly
 cite
 a
 lack
 of


demand.


So
 what
 that
 means
 is
 that
 yes
 the


tariffs
 are
 probably
 helping
 uh
 in
 the


sense
 that
 imports
 are
 becoming
 more


expensive
 but
 there's
 just
 not
 a
 lot
 of


demand
 and
 that
 speaks
 to
 broader


economic
 weakness
 uh
 which
 you
 know


anecdotally
 many
 of
 us
 hear.
 The
 second


interesting
 finding
 is
 that
 these


protected
 industries
 also
 have
 trouble


finding
 uh
 qualified
 people.
 Maybe


there's
 not
 enough
 people
 who
 are


trained
 in
 these


specialized
 trades
 or
 something
 like


that.
 But
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 another


reason
 why
 they
 have
 trouble
 well


ramping
 up
 capacity.
 So
 it's
 both
 demand


and
 uh
 a
 lack
 of
 human
 capital.
 So,


it's
 not
 clear
 that
 the
 tariffs
 aren't


helping,
 but
 it
 could
 be
 just
 the


broader
 economic
 weakness
 is
 outweighing


it.
 And
 the
 researchers
 are
 also
 careful


to
 point
 out
 that
 these
 shifts
 take


time.
 Maybe
 the
 people
 who
 are
 importing


abroad
 and
 they
 need
 some
 time
 to


readjust
 their
 supply
 chains,
 find


domestic
 sources,
 and
 maybe
 it
 just
 to


take
 some
 time
 for
 for
 people
 to
 gear
 up


in
 production.
 So
 we've
 only
 been
 doing


this
 uh
 this
 new
 tariff
 regime
 uh
 for


some
 time
 and
 only
 recently
 have
 become


to
 have
 more
 stability
 in
 tariffs.
 So


this
 is
 something
 that
 we
 can
 continue


to
 watch.
 Again
 according
 to
 common


sense
 you'd
 think
 that
 if
 imports
 become


more
 expensive
 domestically
 produced


goods
 become
 more
 attractive
 on
 the


margin.
 So
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 that


would
 hurt.
 All right.
 So
 that's
 all
 I


prepared
 for
 today.
 Thanks
 so
 much
 for


tuning
 in.
 I'll
 talk
 to
 you
 guys
 next


week.
