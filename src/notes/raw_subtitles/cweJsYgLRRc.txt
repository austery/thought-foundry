I
 hail
 from
 a
 small
 town
 in
 central
 part


of
 India.
 From
 there
 on
 went
 on
 to
 do


computer
 science
 from
 IIT
 Bombay.
 It
 was


definitely
 a
 big
 milestone
 to
 get
 into


IIT.
 Not
 just
 for
 me
 but
 for
 my
 entire


family.
 Well,
 I
 remember
 my
 father


celebrated
 it
 big
 time
 when
 he
 got
 to


know
 I
 got
 into
 IITs.
 During
 IT
 Bombay


always
 wanted
 to
 start
 something
 of
 my


own
 because
 I
 come
 from
 a
 business


background.
 My
 father
 was
 a
 businessman.


The
 next
 chapter
 was
 about
 deciding
 what


should
 I
 do
 when
 I'm
 here.
 It's
 actually


pretty
 uncomfortable
 to
 start
 a
 new


company
 in
 a
 completely
 new
 place
 where


you
 do
 not
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 One


piece
 of
 advice
 that
 I
 would
 give
 to
 any


entrepreneur
 is
 to
 go
 vertical.
 Pick
 an


industry
 that
 you
 like.
 Even
 better
 if


it's
 uh
 an
 industry
 that
 is
 unsexy.
 It


was
 a
 hard
 choice
 cuz
 we
 do
 not
 come


from
 any
 industry.
 going
 vertical
 in
 an


industry
 feels
 like
 a
 hard
 selection


problem
 like
 how
 should
 we
 uh
 pick
 an


industry.
 Looking
 back
 uh
 with
 the


benefit
 of
 hindsight
 I
 feel
 that
 it
 was


a
 blessing
 in
 disguise.
 We
 looked
 at


every
 workflow
 every
 problem
 from
 first


principles
 point
 of
 view.
 The
 most


important
 thing
 is
 pick
 the
 right
 market


then
 pick
 the
 right
 team
 and
 then
 build


the
 right
 product.


Hi
 my
 name
 is
 Saman.
 I'm
 co-founder
 CEO


of
 Further
 AI.
 At
 Further
 AI,
 we're


building
 the
 AI
 workspace
 for
 insurance


to
 take
 away
 the
 busy
 work
 involved
 in


various
 different
 workflows
 and
 we
 are


now
 announcing
 our
 new
 series
 A
 with
 the


and
 recreovitz
 and
 one
 of
 the
 largest
 uh


series
 A
 rounds
 in
 insurance
 AI.
 We
 have


crossed
 million
 in
 revenue.
 We
 just


focused
 on
 insurance
 despite
 not
 having


any
 background.
 Go
 vertical.
 Focus
 on
 an


industry
 rather
 than
 building
 a


horizontal
 software


as
 a
 kid.
 Uh
 have
 been
 top
 of
 the
 class


have
 been
 that
 guy
 who
 sits
 in
 the
 front


bench.
 My
 father
 kept
 actually
 raising


the
 bar
 for
 me.
 I
 was
 in
 a
 school
 if
 I'm


doing
 great
 he
 would
 move
 me
 to
 a
 school


which
 had
 more
 competition.
 So
 more


smarter
 people.
 So
 then
 I
 have
 to


compete.
 Getting
 into
 IITs
 is
 often


really
 hard.
 This
 it's
 a
 very


competitive
 exam.
 I
 had
 this
 initial


pressure
 of
 competing
 with
 now
 the
 best


of
 brains
 or
 like
 top
 50
 or
 100
 brains.


Quickly
 realized
 that
 my
 strength
 has


been
 always
 I'm
 the
 hardest
 worker
 in


any
 room.
 That
 has
 really
 helped
 me
 in


the
 first
 two
 years
 at
 IIT
 Bombay.
 I
 got


like
 perfect
 grades
 and
 so
 on.
 But
 then


realized
 that
 maybe
 it's
 about
 time
 to


sort
 of
 explore
 other
 things.
 And
 that's


where
 I
 got
 more
 active
 in
 sports,


cultural
 aspects
 of
 things,
 in
 like
 the


politics
 part
 of
 things
 as
 well.
 That


was
 fun.
 That
 helped
 me
 learn
 more
 about


myself
 and
 about
 how
 the
 world


functions.


During
 my
 college
 years,
 I
 did


internship
 uh
 at
 Microsoft.
 One
 thing


I'm
 really
 proud
 of
 building
 at


Microsoft
 was
 a
 small
 project
 team
 that


started
 Microsoft
 Community
 Training,


which
 was
 about
 training
 and
 employment


of
 bluecollar
 workers.
 got
 a
 chance
 to


build
 that
 project
 from
 grounds
 up
 with


uh
 my
 mentor
 and
 my
 manager.
 That
 was


super
 fun.
 Got
 a
 chance
 to
 travel
 across


the
 world
 to
 South
 Africa,
 different


parts
 of
 the
 world
 as
 well
 to
 launch


that
 product.
 So
 during
 Microsoft
 uh


there
 was
 a
 hackathon
 project
 that
 we


did
 which
 was
 about
 uh
 matching


candidates
 with
 jobs.
 It
 was
 a
 fun


project
 I
 think
 like
 we
 also
 won
 that


hackathon
 with
 that
 project.
 I
 was
 young


back
 then.
 So
 I
 felt
 that
 okay
 maybe


this
 could
 be
 the
 idea
 that
 will
 change


the
 world
 and
 uh
 it
 was
 funny
 at
 that


point
 in
 time
 every
 software
 engineer


that
 wanted
 to
 change
 the
 world
 started


a
 HR
 tech
 company.
 So
 I
 started
 an
 HR


tech
 company.
 When
 I
 moved
 from


Microsoft
 and
 started
 turbo
 hire
 I
 was


fascinated
 by
 building
 something
 that
 uh


can
 allow
 for
 search
 on
 top
 of
 large
 rum


databases.
 It
 was
 my
 first
 uh
 journey
 as


an
 entrepreneur.
 So
 building
 something


from
 scratch
 uh
 with
 my
 co-founders
 and


taking
 it
 to
 billion
 dollars
 in
 ARR.
 I


had
 to
 decide
 between
 running
 a
 company


back
 in
 India
 or
 being
 with
 a
 person
 I


really
 loved.
 That
 was
 the
 primary


reason
 for
 me
 to
 move
 the
 US.
 I
 asked
 my


wife
 okay
 what what
 should
 I
 do
 next?


Should
 I
 join
 a
 big
 tech
 or
 join
 an


early
 stage
 company
 and
 things
 like


that?
 She
 mentioned
 that
 ammon
 you
 like


to
 build
 you
 are
 wearing
 a
 chip
 on
 your


shoulder
 uh
 and
 you
 want
 to
 build
 a
 big


public
 company
 why
 don't
 you
 give
 it
 a


try
 so
 those
 were
 the
 initial
 months
 of


further
 AI
 where
 I
 was
 not
 sure
 whether


I'll
 build
 my
 second
 company
 or
 not


knowing
 what
 I
 know
 about
 building


companies
 and
 how
 hard
 those
 uh
 that


journey
 could
 be
 one
 thing
 about
 me
 is


like
 I
 think
 which
 is
 I
 think
 about
 a


lot
 of
 founders
 is
 they
 seek
 discomfort


because
 if
 you
 do
 hard
 things
 early
 on


life
 becomes
 easier
 That's
 where
 I
 think


it's
 consistent
 in
 uh
 moving
 to
 um
 Bay


Area
 starting
 in
 insurance
 and
 now
 my


father
 is
 not
 raising
 the
 bar
 for
 my
 own


self
 I
 am
 raising
 that
 bar
 for
 myself.


So
 now
 every
 step
 when
 I
 feel
 that
 I've


met
 the
 bar
 I
 would
 just
 raise
 it
 to
 the


next
 big
 thing
 which
 is
 like
 yet
 another


hill
 to
 climb.
 The
 philosophy
 of
 life
 is


simple
 that
 yeah
 keep
 doing
 hard
 things


good
 things
 will
 happen
 you'll
 learn


more
 and
 at
 the
 end
 when
 you
 look
 back


you'd
 feel
 that
 yeah
 you've
 come
 a
 long


way


in
 the
 early
 days
 of
 uh
 further
 AI
 we


started
 actually
 with
 a
 problem


statement
 which
 was
 very
 comfortable
 to


build
 the
 problem
 that
 I
 faced
 uh
 in
 my


first
 company
 which
 was
 about
 and


building
 AI
 agents
 for
 software
 testing


applied
 to
 YC
 with
 that
 we
 got


shortlisted
 and
 so
 on
 and
 in
 the
 early


days
 of
 YC
 uh
 Sashan
 was
 having
 a


conversation
 with
 Michael
 Cebu
 we


realized
 that
 this
 might
 be
 a
 tarpit


idea
 an
 idea
 that
 we
 are
 not
 uniquely


capable
 uh
 as
 a
 team
 to
 build
 that's


where
 during
 YC
 we
 pivoted
 my
 advice
 to


every
 founder
 doing
 YC
 do
 not
 pivot


during
 YC
 but
 we
 pivoted
 during
 YC
 we


had
 no
 idea
 what
 to
 do
 that
 is
 where
 Tom


Bloomfield
 who
 was
 our
 YC
 partner
 said


that
 you
 guys
 have
 a
 unique
 combination


of
 building
 a
 company
 and
 AI
 so
 Sashank


who
 is
 My
 co-founder
 has
 AI
 experience.


I
 had
 previously
 built
 a
 company.
 So
 he


said
 that
 why
 don't
 you
 guys
 go


vertical.
 Pick
 an
 industry
 partner
 with


it
 and
 it
 was
 a
 hard
 choice
 at
 that


point
 in
 time
 because
 we
 do
 do
 not
 come


from
 any
 industry.
 So
 we
 created


actually
 some
 rules.
 We
 created
 three


roles.
 Industries
 where
 there
 is
 a
 lot


like
 lot
 of
 unstructured
 data
 could
 be


good
 industries
 because
 now
 LLMs
 can


process
 that
 faster.
 Industries
 which


has
 labor
 shortage
 and
 shrinking


margins.
 The
 first
 one
 allows
 for
 uh
 why


now
 in
 terms
 of
 technology
 but
 the
 the


later
 two
 allows
 for
 why
 now
 in
 terms
 of


business.
 So
 whatever
 we
 build
 will
 get


adopted
 faster.
 So
 we
 shortlisted
 three


industries
 mortgage
 legal
 and
 insurance.


I
 remember
 like
 we
 drove
 drove
 around


the
 Bay
 Area
 with
 a
 box
 of
 donuts
 going


from
 one
 insurance
 agent
 to
 the
 other


learning
 about
 their
 workflows
 uh


talking
 about
 what
 problems
 they
 face.


It
 was
 a
 scary
 experience
 to
 say
 the


least.
 But
 uh
 we
 learned
 a
 lot
 in
 that


process.
 Also
 we
 got
 over
 our
 initial


fear
 of
 unknown
 as
 well.
 And
 then
 that


gave
 us
 initial
 insights
 into
 different


workflows
 that
 currently
 exist
 in


insurance.
 We
 started
 we
 took
 that


knowledge
 that
 we
 gathered
 in
 these
 site


visits.
 Looking
 back
 uh
 with
 the
 benefit


of
 hindsight
 I
 feel
 that
 it
 was
 a


blessing
 in
 disguise.
 We
 looked
 at
 every


workflow,
 every
 problem
 from
 first


principles
 point
 of
 view
 without
 making


assumptions
 that
 that's
 how
 things


should
 be.
 I
 remember
 this
 one
 workflow


where
 underwriting
 teams
 or
 carriers


requested
 brokers
 to
 fill
 the
 forms
 on


their
 website.
 So
 everybody
 was
 building


these
 web
 portals
 and
 I
 felt
 that
 that


is
 possibly
 not
 the
 best
 way
 because


brokers
 did
 not
 like
 filling
 data
 over


portals
 and
 nobody
 likes
 filling
 data


over
 portals.
 what
 everybody
 wanted
 is


can
 I
 just
 send
 this
 email
 to
 you
 uh


whereas
 a
 lot
 of
 teams
 were
 actually


spending
 money
 and
 time
 and
 energy
 in


building
 these
 portals
 so
 we
 question


that
 okay
 why
 don't
 you
 accept
 a


submission
 over
 an
 email
 and
 then
 let
 AI


fill
 this
 data
 in
 your
 internal
 portals


rather
 than
 making
 human
 team
 members
 do


that
 which
 they
 don't
 like
 doing
 this


way
 you
 can
 increase
 the
 sub
 to
 code


ratio
 the
 code
 tobind
 ratio
 and
 so
 on
 so


forth
 it's
 good
 for
 business
 and
 good


for
 customer
 experience
 uh
 and
 so
 on.
 So


by
 thinking
 of
 things
 from
 first


principles
 point
 of
 view
 allowed
 us
 to


really
 build
 something
 which
 I
 think


that
 if
 I
 was
 from
 the
 industry
 I
 might


not
 have
 because
 I
 would
 have
 felt
 that


this
 is
 how
 things
 have
 been.


Insurance
 usually
 is
 labeled
 as
 slow
 to


adopt
 technology
 but
 on
 the
 ground
 what


we
 were
 seeing
 was
 people
 really
 wanted


to
 automate
 the
 workflows
 that
 were


manual
 and
 repetitive.
 One
 thing
 I've


learned
 is
 the
 best
 sales
 tool
 today
 is


a
 dinner
 table
 like
 you
 should
 meet


people
 in
 person
 try
 to
 have
 a


conversation
 try
 to
 understand
 problem


and
 then
 equally
 about
 they
 buying
 the


product
 but
 it's
 also
 about
 they
 buying


like
 you
 in
 some
 sense
 and
 form
 that
 hey


I
 want
 to
 work
 with
 you.
 So
 that's
 one


big
 learning
 that
 uh
 has
 happened
 that


people
 work
 with
 people.
 Apart
 from
 that


other
 things
 about
 sales
 that
 we
 learned


is
 like
 outbound
 works.
 Yes.
 But
 one
 big


trick
 that
 worked
 in
 the
 early
 days
 is


called
 show
 me
 you
 know
 me.
 Try
 to


actually
 do
 things
 that
 don't
 scale
 like


why
 says.
 So
 we
 wrote
 a
 lot
 of
 emails


which
 were
 like
 extremely
 personalized


to
 people.
 That
 really
 helps
 in
 getting


a
 response
 because
 then
 the
 other
 person


knows
 that
 you've
 really
 written
 that


email
 just
 for
 them
 and
 not
 massmailing


mailing
 it
 to
 them
 and
 takes
 a
 lot
 of


effort
 to
 write
 such
 emails
 but
 it


really
 works
 as
 well.
 So
 putting
 myself


in
 the
 shoes
 of
 uh
 the
 buyer
 really


helps.
 Let's
 say
 if
 I'm
 buying
 a


technology
 software
 for
 100k
 I
 don't


want
 to
 log
 get
 logged
 into
 a
 contract


for
 a
 year
 before
 I
 give
 it
 a
 spin.
 So


we
 added
 things
 like
 two
 month
 opt
 out


and
 so
 on.
 All
 of
 these
 are
 now
 uh
 very


fairly
 standard
 practices.
 Even
 YC


recommends
 all
 of
 these
 things.
 It
 was


interesting
 to
 learn
 all
 of
 these


things.
 The
 first
 time
 around
 uh
 when
 we


were
 building
 this
 enterprise
 sales


motion,


there
 are
 two
 goals
 that
 I
 have
 in
 mind


with
 further
 AI.
 The
 first
 one
 is
 to


build
 a
 public
 company.
 But
 the
 second


one
 which
 is
 also
 way
 core
 to
 me
 is
 to


build
 a
 launchpad
 uh
 of
 success
 for


people
 who
 come
 in
 contact
 with
 further


AI.
 It
 could
 be
 our
 customers,
 it
 could


be
 our
 team
 members.
 And
 that's
 where


like
 when
 we
 hired
 people
 or
 people


joined
 us,
 it's
 been
 a
 lot
 about
 like


high
 agency
 and
 low
 drama.
 Uh
 that's
 the


kind
 of
 people
 I
 work
 really
 well
 with.


I
 think
 there's
 a
 saying
 right
 like
 you


attract
 your
 uh
 tribe
 and
 I
 think
 for
 me


I'm
 that
 person
 who
 likes
 to
 solve
 hard


problem
 run
 through
 the
 walls
 if
 I
 have


to
 uh
 and
 so
 on
 and
 interestingly
 the


team
 that
 joined
 further
 AI
 had
 the
 same


DNA
 people
 who
 like
 to
 work
 on
 hard


problems
 they
 don't
 mind
 grinding
 12


hours
 a
 day
 if
 it
 if
 that's
 what
 it


takes
 to
 solve
 a
 problem
 or
 get


something
 done
 and
 so
 on
 so
 AI
 is


changing
 fast
 right
 we
 all
 know
 that
 the


good
 thing
 is
 that
 we
 are
 all
 learning


as
 the
 ecosystem
 system
 evolves,
 we
 want


to
 be
 at
 the
 forefront
 of
 it
 from
 the


insurance
 perspective
 and
 be
 that


trusted
 partner
 for
 uh
 our
 customers
 to


bring
 in
 the
 latest
 efficiencies
 that
 AI


is
 bringing
 in.
 So
 we
 have
 positioned


ourselves
 at
 an
 intersection
 of
 AI
 and


insurance
 and
 then
 working
 backwards


from
 the
 principle
 that
 the
 goal
 is
 to


drive
 business
 metrics
 rather
 than
 to


just
 build
 technology
 for
 the
 sake
 of


it.


So
 a
 lot
 has
 changed
 since
 the
 early


college
 days
 to
 Microsoft
 to
 building


the
 first
 company
 to
 now
 building
 the


second
 company.
 The
 funny
 thing
 about


being
 a
 second
 time
 founder
 is
 that
 the


lows
 are
 lows
 but
 the
 highs
 are
 not
 that


high
 because
 you
 know
 there
 is
 more
 to


build.
 But
 uh
 having
 said
 that
 I
 think


as
 a
 person
 I
 have
 become
 more
 patient.


have
 become
 more
 people
 first
 and
 my


narrative
 shifted
 from
 me
 me
 to
 VVV
 and


that
 is
 more
 satisfying
 uh
 as
 a
 human


being
 and
 we're
 building
 towards
 being


the
 best
 company
 in
 insurance
 and
 AI.
 I


was
 discussing
 with
 uh
 somebody
 the


title
 of
 my
 biography
 half
 monk
 half


machine
 and
 it's
 interesting
 I
 think


that
 describes
 me
 really
 well
 as
 a


person
 because
 when
 I'm
 like
 wired
 in
 or


logged
 in
 I
 am
 like
 a
 machine
 like


clocking


uh
 work
 on
 a
 personal
 side
 on
 uh


personal
 side
 I'm
 more
 like
 a
 monk
 I'm


very
 patient
 I
 look
 at
 positive
 in


people
 I'm
 a
 glass
 half
 full
 guy
 I
 try


to
 moderate
 a
 lot
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


I
 say
 very
 often
 and
 people
 who
 know
 me


would
 possibly
 roll
 their
 eyes
 after


listening
 to
 this
 is
 everything
 is
 good


in
 moderation.
 Even
 moderation
 that's


the
 monk
 side
 uh
 of
 me.
 So
 yeah,


hopefully
 someday
 the
 book
 title
 would


be
 half
 monk,
 half
 machine.
