Well,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 the
 kind


introduction
 and
 also
 thank
 you
 to
 Nogus


Bank
 for
 this
 invitation.
 And
 it's
 a
 new


situation
 because
 in
 the
 past
 when
 I
 had


speeches
 like
 this,
 I
 would
 be
 supported


by
 lots
 of
 samples
 in
 the
 back
 of
 the


room,
 Kit
 Kat,
 chocolate,
 Nespresso


coffee,
 what
 have
 you.
 Today,
 I
 have
 to


convince
 you
 just
 by
 the
 strength
 of
 my


argument.
 So,
 it's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 higher


hurdle
 and
 um
 I'm
 asking
 for
 your


understanding.
 Um,
 I
 wanted
 to
 blow
 out


Norrisbank
 for
 not
 just
 the
 invitation,


but
 also
 for
 adding
 leadership
 and


culture
 to
 the
 roster
 and
 the
 agenda
 of


this
 conference
 because
 many
 of
 you
 in


the
 room
 are
 experts
 at
 running
 your


DCFS,
 valuing
 a
 company,
 valuing
 a


business
 opportunity.
 But
 I
 do
 believe


that
 having
 a
 handle
 and
 having
 your
 own


thoughts
 about
 a
 business's
 culture
 and


leadership
 is
 an
 important
 consistency


check.
 It's
 another
 dimension
 that
 helps


you
 tell
 apart
 a
 story
 that
 just
 sounds


good
 on
 a
 PowerPoint
 from
 a
 story
 that


is
 true
 quality
 and
 that's
 more
 likely


to
 be
 resilient
 and
 sustainable.
 We


heard
 in
 the
 previous
 panel,
 you
 know,


quality
 companies
 are
 hard
 to
 find.
 And


I
 do
 believe
 that
 one
 thing
 that
 all


quality
 companies
 have
 in
 common
 is
 this


strong
 culture.
 something
 that
 creates
 a


legends
 between
 the
 executives
 working


for
 that
 business
 and
 the
 company
 and


also
 among
 the
 executives
 between
 each


other
 as
 a
 team
 and
 uh
 hence
 it's


important.
 Now
 I
 wanted
 to
 share
 a
 few


thoughts
 on
 this.
 So
 first
 of
 all
 to
 put


in
 the
 overall
 perspective
 of
 a
 CEO's


job
 um
 there's
 lots
 of
 things
 you're


doing
 day
 in
 day
 out
 I
 would
 group
 them


into
 three
 major
 buckets
 and
 this
 is
 not


by
 order
 of
 importance
 just
 to
 enumerate


them.
 The
 first
 one
 is
 portfolio
 and


strategy.
 So
 what
 is
 it
 as
 products
 and


services
 you're
 selling
 and
 why
 do
 you


believe
 you
 have
 longer
 term
 sustainable


competitive
 advantage
 in


it?
 Second
 part
 is
 structure
 and


incentives.
 So
 basically
 how
 do
 you


group
 the
 teams
 in
 your
 company
 in
 ways


that
 all
 of
 these
 good
 things
 are
 being


brought
 out
 the
 door
 in
 a
 successful


manner.
 And
 the
 third
 one
 is
 culture.


And
 um
 culture
 is
 something
 that
 is


somehow
 different
 from
 these
 first
 two


in
 the
 sense
 that
 you
 can't
 just
 every


once
 in
 a
 while
 revisit
 it.
 You
 have
 to


live
 it
 every
 day
 from
 the
 moment
 in
 the


morning
 you
 walk
 into
 the
 door
 to
 the


last
 email
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 What


you
 have
 to
 watch
 out
 for
 is
 not
 just


the
 factual
 answers
 you're
 giving
 or
 the


factual
 announcements
 you're
 making.
 You


also
 have
 to
 watch
 out
 for
 the


consistency
 like
 what
 signals
 am
 I


sending
 into
 the
 organization
 and
 uh


does
 that
 make
 sense
 compared
 to
 what
 I


said
 yesterday,
 last
 month,
 last
 year


because
 if
 you
 change
 your
 tune
 um
 every


so
 often,
 I
 think
 you
 do
 confuse
 the


organization.
 So
 that
 consistency
 and


being
 somehow
 in
 sync
 with
 where
 the


culture
 is
 coming
 from
 and
 where
 you


wanted
 to
 get
 to
 over
 time
 is
 really


really
 important.
 Sounds
 pretty
 obvious,


but
 look,
 I
 mean,
 CEOs
 are
 no
 robots.
 I


mean,
 we're
 humans
 and
 we're
 subject
 to


um
 moods
 of
 the
 moment.
 We're
 subject
 to


different,
 you
 know,
 exposures
 over


time.
 And
 so
 bearing
 and
 and
 and


displaying
 that
 cons
 consistency
 over


time
 is
 more
 difficult
 than
 it


sounds.
 Now,
 as
 you
 as
 investors
 look
 at


culture,
 um
 a
 few
 things
 to
 think
 about.


First
 one
 is
 culture
 is
 incredibly


sticky.
 The
 larger
 and
 the
 more
 historic


and
 iconic
 an
 organization,
 the
 more


sticky
 it
 is.
 And
 the
 reason
 that's


important
 to
 you
 is
 when
 you
 have
 CEOs


telling
 you
 that
 for
 a
 large


long-standing
 historic
 company,
 they


changed
 the
 culture
 in
 the
 course
 of
 two


or
 three
 years.
 At
 the
 risk
 of
 giving


you
 a
 provocative
 statement
 here,
 sell


the
 stock.
 Okay?
 because
 honestly
 either


these
 people
 don't
 really
 know
 what


they're
 talking
 about
 and
 are
 out
 of


touch
 with
 what's
 really
 going
 on
 inside


the
 organizations
 or
 they're
 vastly


overselling
 uh
 their
 own
 achievements.


Both
 of
 these
 are
 not
 good.
 Uh
 culture


change
 does
 take
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 and
 uh


the
 best
 way
 for
 you
 with
 your
 exposure


to
 financial
 industry
 to
 judge
 that


think
 back
 to
 all
 these
 banking
 mergers


in
 the
 1990s
 and
 early
 2000s.
 To
 this


day
 with
 many
 of
 these
 large
 financial


institutions
 when
 you
 walk
 into
 these


companies
 you
 can
 sometimes
 tell
 apart


you
 know
 one
 part
 from
 the
 other
 in


those
 mergers
 coming
 together.
 So


cultures
 are
 incredibly
 sticky
 and


industrial
 firms
 are
 not
 different
 from


that.
 Next
 one
 um


culture
 in
 most
 attributes
 is
 not
 a
 wish


list.
 So
 if
 someone
 presents
 to
 you
 a


culture
 and
 it
 has
 only
 positive


attributes,
 it's
 a
 good
 moment
 to
 be


suspicious.
 On
 most
 attributes,
 there's


a
 spectrum.
 So
 think
 about,
 for
 example,


speed
 versus
 stability.
 So
 if
 someone


claims
 that
 their
 organization
 can
 turn


on
 a
 dime
 and
 react
 in
 line
 with
 fastest


ones
 in
 the
 industry,
 what
 does
 that


mean
 for
 resilience
 in
 the
 face
 of
 bad


news?
 What
 does
 this
 mean
 for
 the


ability
 to
 sit
 out
 a
 poor
 quarter
 or
 a


poor
 year
 and
 not
 lose
 sight
 of
 some
 of


your
 longerterm
 objectives?
 And
 most
 of


these
 things
 do
 happen
 on
 a
 spectrum.


You
 can't
 just
 pick
 the
 positive
 one
 of


each
 and
 claim
 that
 that's
 your
 culture


going
 forward.
 And
 so
 when
 you
 have


these
 conversations
 in
 the
 future,
 when


you
 hear
 too
 many
 of
 the
 good
 ones,
 ask


for
 the
 bad
 ones.
 Ask
 for
 what
 it
 means


for
 the
 other
 side
 of
 the
 spectrum.
 And


you
 know,
 is
 there
 something
 in
 the


conversation
 that's
 missing?


Next
 one
 I
 wanted
 to
 talk
 about
 is
 as
 a


CEO,
 how
 do
 you
 actually
 change
 and


shape
 culture?
 And
 um
 in
 my
 view,
 there


are
 two
 levers.
 A
 short-term
 one
 and
 a


long-term
 one.
 The
 short-term
 one
 is


using
 the
 soapbox,
 for
 lack
 of
 a
 better


word,
 that
 every
 CEO
 has
 inside
 the


organization,
 outside
 the
 organization,


where
 essentially
 you
 indicate
 the
 way


you
 want
 it
 to
 be.
 And
 then
 in
 addition


to
 all
 the
 communication
 events
 that
 you


have,
 whether
 it's
 small
 groups,


individual
 meetings,
 or
 large
 group


meetings,
 when
 every
 time
 you're
 facing


a
 decision,
 you're
 trying
 to
 essentially


link
 that
 decision
 to
 some
 of
 these


attributes
 you're
 talking
 about.
 And


this
 way,
 you
 kind
 of
 reinforce
 it.
 But


that's
 communication.
 And
 um
 while
 it


travels
 pretty
 fast
 in
 an
 organization,


you
 can
 only
 you
 can
 only
 go
 so
 far
 when


it
 comes
 to
 the
 sustainability.
 Uh
 the


long-term
 part,
 the
 true
 stickiness
 that


lasts
 over
 generations
 is
 the
 one
 that


happens
 through
 people.
 And
 there
 it's


about
 selecting
 and
 promoting
 the
 people


that
 you
 believe
 embody
 the
 cultural


attributes
 the
 best
 way
 that
 you
 would


want
 to
 see
 for
 your
 organization
 or
 in


your
 outside
 hiring
 selectively


advancing
 those
 attributes.
 And
 there


you
 see
 why
 it
 takes
 a
 lot
 of
 time


because
 you
 can't
 turn
 over
 entire
 large


groups
 of
 leadership
 teams
 at
 the
 same


time.
 So
 this
 takes
 patience
 and
 it's


always
 a
 balance
 between
 the
 change
 you


want
 but
 then
 also
 not
 destabilizing
 the


organization
 and
 hence
 that's
 the
 reason


why
 it
 can
 easily
 take
 5
 10
 15
 years
 as


you
 know
 not
 just
 your
 senior
 leadership


team
 but
 also
 the
 next
 layers
 of
 the


organization
 um
 get
 changed
 in
 that


regard.
 That's
 the
 more
 lasting
 one.


That's
 the
 one
 that
 leaves
 a
 legacy


behind
 and
 then
 obviously
 as
 you
 change


from
 there
 as
 your
 environment
 changes


and
 you
 would
 want
 to
 evolve
 and
 migrate


your
 hers
 you
 again
 have
 to
 be
 very


patient
 about
 that
 there
 is
 no
 shortcuts


uh
 again
 those
 short-term
 situations


usually


um
 do
 not
 have
 staying
 power
 and
 it's


important
 to
 keep
 that
 in
 mind.
 Now
 when


it
 comes
 to
 large
 organizations


um
 let
 me
 highlight
 two
 common
 pitfalls


and
 this
 is
 not
 a
 specific
 reflection
 on


any
 specific
 company
 but
 from
 many


conversations
 with
 COP
 simply
 what
 I


heard
 and
 what
 I
 also
 experienced
 in
 my


own
 professional
 life
 and
 large


companies
 may
 have
 many
 strengths
 but


there's
 two
 common
 weaknesses
 to
 watch


out
 for
 the
 first
 one
 is
 inside
 focus
 in


many
 large
 companies
 especially
 the
 ones


that
 have
 a
 deep
 vertical
 structure.
 You


may
 spend
 a
 long
 time
 in
 your


professional
 career
 before
 you
 really


have
 to
 deal
 with
 the


outside.
 Remember,
 a
 salesperson,
 a


junior
 salesperson
 may
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 the


outside,
 but
 they're
 applying
 decisions


that
 are
 made
 at
 the
 senior
 level
 like
 a


price
 list
 for
 example.
 So,
 it's
 only
 at


the
 top
 of
 the
 organization
 where
 you


get
 into
 these
 trade-offs
 like
 raising


prices
 versus
 market
 share
 or
 some
 other


key
 decisions
 that
 link
 the
 outside
 of


the
 company
 to
 the
 inside
 of
 a
 company.


And
 the
 larger
 a
 business
 is
 um
 the


longer
 it
 takes
 executives
 to
 get
 to


that
 level
 and
 before
 all
 of
 your


advancements
 your
 your
 career
 progress


usually
 gets
 determined
 by
 playing
 the


inside
 game.
 And
 um
 that's
 why
 I
 believe


when
 it
 comes
 to
 schooling
 senior


leaders,
 usually
 a
 smaller
 company
 tends


to
 be
 the
 better
 breeding
 ground.
 And


with
 larger
 companies,
 that
 whole


notion,
 what
 do
 you
 do
 from
 the
 top
 to


counter
 that
 inside
 thinking
 that


requires
 constant


attention?
 The
 other
 one
 is


accountability
 or
 the
 lack
 of


accountability.


And
 here
 again,
 the
 larger,
 the
 more


complex
 the
 organization,
 the
 more


matrix
 the
 organization,
 the
 more
 you


find
 that
 people
 oversell
 the
 good


things.
 Like
 25
 people
 claiming
 that


they
 were
 the
 ones
 who
 created
 the
 good


news
 and
 underell
 the
 bad
 things.
 Look


the
 other
 way
 hoping
 that
 it
 doesn't
 get


attached
 to
 you.
 And
 that's
 also
 a
 very


common
 pitfall
 and
 one
 where
 like
 with


the
 inside
 focus
 there
 is
 no
 simple


recipe
 for
 how
 to
 counter
 that.
 What
 you


have
 to
 do
 as
 a
 leader
 dayto
 day
 is
 to


try
 and
 call
 out
 these
 situations.
 Try


to
 be
 sure
 you
 instill
 that
 outside


thinking.
 try
 to
 be
 sure
 that
 you
 do


find
 the
 people
 that
 were
 responsible


for
 the
 good
 things
 but
 also
 for
 the


things
 that
 didn't
 go
 so
 well
 and
 that


there's
 justice
 in
 the
 organization


because
 once
 people
 feel
 that
 they
 can


get
 away
 with
 a
 lack
 of
 accountability


it
 goes
 downhill
 from


there.
 So
 those
 were
 some
 of
 the
 high


level
 thoughts
 I
 wanted
 to
 share.
 I


wanted
 to
 leave
 on
 something
 that's
 a


bit
 of a
 gear
 shift
 from
 what
 I
 was
 just


covering
 before
 and
 that
 is
 I
 wanted
 to


tell
 you
 that
 um
 in
 total
 I've
 been


serving
 as
 a
 public
 company
 CEO
 for
 21


years
 and
 when
 I
 look
 at
 how
 leadership


teams
 have
 changed
 over
 those
 two


decades
 I've
 seen
 a
 remarkable
 change


coming
 from
 diversity
 inclusion
 and
 I've


seen
 very
 significant
 changes
 not
 just


in
 the
 sense
 of
 correcting
 historic


wrongs
 but
 also
 I've
 seen
 tremendous


benefit
 to
 the
 businesses
 because
 the


quality
 of
 the
 discussion
 has
 improved


so
 much.
 It's
 a
 whole
 different


discussion
 that
 brings
 different
 views


to
 the
 table
 a
 lot
 more
 bandwidth
 and


kind
 of
 enabling
 organizations
 that
 are


designed
 to
 serve
 society
 to
 actually
 do


that
 because
 society
 does
 come
 with
 a


much
 broader
 cross-section
 than
 what


leadership
 teams
 used
 to
 have
 in
 the


past.
 And
 um
 what
 I
 wanted
 to
 tell
 you


is
 obviously
 in
 the
 current
 debate
 it
 is


important
 that
 for
 a
 large
 company


everyone
 follows
 the
 local
 laws
 in
 every


jurisdiction
 where
 they
 work.
 But
 I
 do


hope
 and
 I
 also
 hope
 that
 you
 as


investors
 pay
 attention
 to
 that
 that
 the


overall
 spirit
 of
 what
 can
 get
 done
 with


more
 diverse
 more
 inclusive
 leadership


teams
 that
 that
 doesn't
 get
 lost
 because


I
 do
 believe
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 true


areas
 of
 progress
 over
 the
 last
 few


decades.
 And
 I
 do
 I
 also
 believe
 there


is
 ways
 to
 go
 and
 I
 do
 believe
 that
 in


addition
 to
 the
 moral
 ethical
 standards


I
 do
 believe
 there's
 also
 business


rationale
 with
 it.
 I
 stop
 it
 here
 and


look
 forward
 to
 the
 panel.
 Thanks.


[Applause]
