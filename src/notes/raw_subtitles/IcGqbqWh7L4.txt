Thank
 you.
 I
 feel
 very
 fortunate
 to
 be


able
 to
 moderate
 a
 panel
 after
 having


heard
 both
 of
 you.
 As
 you
 know,
 we
 had


questions
 in
 advance,
 but
 I
 have
 so
 many


more
 questions
 now
 that
 I've
 heard
 both


of
 your
 remarks.
 And
 I
 actually
 want
 to


start
 with
 something
 that
 was
 a
 theme


through
 both
 of
 your
 your
 comments,
 and


that
 is
 around
 the
 people.
 Um,
 Moretta,


I'll
 start
 with
 you
 because
 I
 find
 it


interesting
 that
 prior
 to
 becoming
 the


sole
 CEO,
 you
 had
 a
 a
 career
 in
 HR
 or


that's
 not
 typically
 a
 job
 that
 is


promoted
 into
 the
 CEO
 role.
 Tell
 us
 a


little
 bit
 about
 what
 you
 learned
 about


leadership
 by
 leading
 the
 human


resources
 function.


Well,
 uh,
 I
 know
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an


odd
 way
 to
 enter
 in
 as
 as
 a
 CEO
 and
 and


stepping
 back,
 it
 was
 previously
 talked


about,
 you
 talked
 about
 Enron.
 Uh,
 I
 was


working
 in
 Arthur
 Anderson
 at
 the
 time.


I
 was
 a
 financial
 management
 consultant


and
 it
 led
 to
 the
 dissolution
 of
 an
 of


Anderson.
 And
 in
 Norway
 at
 that
 point
 in


time,
 we
 were
 merged
 with
 EY.
 Uh,
 we


were
 approximately
 200
 2,000
 people
 in


EY,
 2,000
 people
 in
 Arthur
 Anderson.
 And


everyone
 thought
 that
 this
 merger
 was


going
 to
 be
 great
 and
 simple
 because
 the


two
 companies
 they
 provided
 the
 same


services.
 And
 I
 was
 asked
 to
 analyze
 and


to
 uh
 to
 get
 the
 possibility
 actually
 to


to
 merge
 these
 two
 and
 colllocate
 26


offices.
 And
 during
 that
 time
 I
 did
 the


math
 afterwards.
 Some
 of
 the


collocations
 were
 were
 were
 great.
 Some


of
 them
 were
 not
 so
 great.
 And
 the


pattern
 was
 this
 where
 we
 had
 great


leadership
 where
 they
 were
 able
 to
 come


together
 from
 a
 cultural
 perspective


because
 at
 that
 point
 in
 time
 the


culture
 was
 quite
 different
 in
 these
 two


great
 companies
 but
 it
 was
 different
 and


sticky
 where
 they
 were
 able
 to
 work


together
 that
 actually
 worked
 and
 we
 got


financial
 great
 performance
 where
 they


weren't
 we
 had
 a
 struggle
 so
 that


actually
 made
 me
 want
 to
 move
 over
 to


working
 with
 HR
 and
 and
 since
 then
 uh


also
 during
 my
 studies
 I
 I
 studied


psychology.
 I've
 done
 coaching
 and
 and


I'm
 very
 passionate
 about
 the
 area.
 So,


um
 I
 usually
 say
 that
 winning
 in
 most


businesses
 is
 more
 about
 having
 the


right
 people
 than
 anything
 else.
 I
 feel


lucky
 that
 I
 have
 been
 able
 to
 actually


see
 how
 performance
 is
 so
 tightly
 linked


to
 leadership
 and
 I
 learned
 something


new
 with
 respect
 to
 leadership
 every


single
 day.
 Uh
 so
 as
 as
 long
 as
 you're


able
 to
 sort
 of
 speak
 of
 these
 warm


words
 culture
 and
 actually


operationalize
 it
 in
 the
 way
 that
 we


have
 in
 Visma
 uh
 it
 runs
 really
 nicely.


Yeah.
 Thank
 you.
 So
 Mark,
 I
 want
 to
 pick


up
 on
 what
 you
 ended
 on
 and
 that
 is
 um


what
 the
 insights
 that
 you've
 had
 around


the
 role
 of
 diversity
 and
 inclusion
 in


the
 workforce
 and
 as
 you
 also
 alluded
 to


certainly
 in
 the
 United
 States
 that's


something
 that
 is
 under
 tremendous


pressure
 at
 the
 moment
 but
 I'm
 wondering


given
 your
 journey
 your
 leadership


journey
 now
 across
 multiple
 companies
 21


years
 as
 a
 CEO
 how
 did
 you
 come
 to


identify
 that
 um
 engaging
 and
 and
 and


finding
 ways
 to
 build
 a
 culture
 culture


around
 a
 diverse
 community
 was
 so


central
 to
 the
 success
 of
 the
 companies


that
 you've
 run.
 Look,
 I
 think
 like
 most


leaders
 and
 most
 corporations,
 it


happens
 step
 by
 step
 because
 those
 20


years
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 company,
 a
 lot
 has


changed.
 And
 um
 when
 I
 compare,
 you


know,
 today's
 executive
 leadership
 team,


whether
 it's
 Nestle,
 Fzenius
 or
 any


other
 large
 company
 I'm
 aware
 of
 to
 what


it
 was
 like
 uh
 20
 25
 years
 ago,
 it's


certainly
 a
 lot
 more
 diverse.
 it


represents
 the
 globe
 in
 much
 better


ways.
 There's
 better
 gender


representation
 and
 um
 I
 found
 that
 in


addition
 to
 bringing
 these
 different


perspectives
 to
 the
 table,
 the
 tone
 of


the
 table
 also
 changed.
 It's
 no
 longer


just
 about
 ramming
 something
 through
 and


bulldozing,
 you
 know,
 other
 arguments.


It's
 about
 a
 true
 competition
 of
 ideas


and
 also
 frankly
 most
 of
 the
 time
 a
 more


civilized
 debate.
 And
 um
 so
 when
 you
 see


that
 and
 when
 you
 see
 better
 decisions,


better
 results
 coming
 out
 of
 that
 uh


over
 time,
 step
 by
 step,
 you
 become
 a


true
 believer.
 Uh
 I
 do
 want
 to
 highlight


nonetheless
 and
 this
 is
 important
 to
 me.


I
 mean
 we
 were
 doing
 two
 things
 all
 of


us
 over
 those
 years.
 One
 is
 we
 were


correcting
 historic
 wrongs.
 Let's
 not


lose
 sight
 of
 that.
 Diversity
 inclusion


is
 not
 a
 business
 tool
 only.
 Okay?
 It


delivers
 results.
 It's
 it's
 one
 of
 these


perfect
 cases
 of
 doing
 well
 and
 doing


good
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 And
 that's


important
 to
 me
 because
 let's
 not


belittle
 it
 to
 just
 being
 a
 strategy.


Thank
 you
 for
 sharing
 that.


Um
 Merit,
 I
 know
 that
 part
 of
 what's


important
 to
 you
 around
 the
 diversity


space
 is
 women
 and
 you
 talk
 about
 the


role
 of
 or
 your
 your
 desire
 to
 ensure


that
 women
 are
 actively
 engaged
 in
 the


work
 at
 Visma
 and
 other
 places.
 Tell
 us


more
 about
 why
 that
 has
 been
 important


to
 you
 and
 how
 you've
 seen
 it
 evolve.


Well,
 specifically,
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 the


most
 important
 part
 of
 diversity.
 You


mentioned
 it
 very
 well,
 Mark,
 and
 it's


really
 important
 to
 increase
 the
 talent


pool.
 And
 what
 we
 have
 experienced,


especially
 in
 tech
 and
 especially
 when


you
 acquire
 a
 lot
 of
 amazing
 companies


in
 general,
 the
 entrepreneurs,
 there
 are


very
 few
 female
 entrepreneurs.


uh
 I
 unfortunately
 can
 hardly
 remember


uh
 many
 companies
 that
 we
 have
 acquired


where
 the
 females
 uh
 were
 entrepreneurs.


Um
 and
 I
 think
 that
 also
 is
 maybe
 on


average
 a
 gender
 difference
 that
 that


that
 men
 are
 more
 risktakers.
 If
 I
 look


at
 the
 portfolio
 of
 all
 the
 companies
 we


have
 as
 the
 companies
 grow
 and
 become


more
 sizable
 and
 more
 structured
 we
 have


more
 females
 coming
 in
 uh
 and
 actually


professionalizing
 to
 a
 larger
 extent.


There's
 lots
 of
 uh
 I'm
 just
 trying
 to


sort
 of
 average
 it
 out,
 but
 for
 me
 it's


been
 extremely
 important
 to
 increase
 the


talent
 pool.
 It's


been
 interesting
 to
 see
 how
 you
 need
 to


tailor
 ads
 and
 how
 you
 approach
 females


versus
 male
 because
 we
 have
 different


preferences.
 uh
 we
 have
 always
 these


past
 years
 been
 spending
 a
 lot
 of
 time


making
 sure
 that
 we
 poke
 people
 uh
 on
 on


their
 shoulder
 if
 we
 believe
 that
 they


should
 actually
 apply
 for
 a
 job
 because


on
 average
 a
 lot
 of
 males
 can
 look
 at
 a


description
 and
 say
 I
 know
 50%
 I'll
 go


for
 it
 while
 the
 females
 go
 I
 know
 90%


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 apply
 so
 so
 actively


pinpointing
 to
 get
 more
 people
 and
 a


more
 diverse
 group
 in
 the
 process
 that


has
 had
 a
 really
 good
 result
 and
 now


we're
 actually
 at
 36
 and
 a
 half%
 of


female
 leadership
 in
 Visma.
 Could
 I
 just


build
 on
 that?
 That
 meshes
 incredibly


well
 with
 my
 experience.
 So
 the
 number


of
 times
 I
 was
 actively
 motivating,


encouraging
 women
 to
 take
 a
 promotion


where
 they
 felt
 they
 weren't
 ready.
 I've


never
 heard
 that
 from
 a
 man.
 And
 so


clearly
 there's
 something
 here
 that
 um


you
 know
 you
 actively
 have
 to
 kind
 of


push
 for
 and
 work
 forward
 to
 make
 it


happen.
 That
 same
 dynamic
 happens
 in
 the


NBA
 classroom
 as
 well.


see
 that
 quite
 regularly.


Um,
 so
 one
 of
 the
 outcomes
 of
 a
 diverse


workforce
 is
 innovation.
 There's
 plenty


of
 research
 that
 says
 that
 the
 more


diversity
 you
 have
 in
 in
 the
 decision-m


and
 the
 the
 idea
 generation,
 the
 more


innovative,
 the
 more
 creative
 outcomes


will
 will
 result.
 But
 at
 the
 same
 time


when
 you
 have
 that
 diversity
 it's
 it's


because
 there
 are
 differences
 in
 how


people
 approach
 the
 world
 that
 it
 can


become
 contentious
 or
 challenging.
 It


can
 take
 longer.
 How
 do
 you
 balance
 the


benefit
 of
 the
 great
 outcome
 from
 a


diverse
 environment
 visav
 the
 the


tension
 that
 is
 oftentimes
 created
 when


you
 have
 people
 from
 disperate


perspectives.


Erica
 the
 risk
 of
 twisting
 it
 slightly


when
 it
 comes
 to
 innovation.
 I
 mean


obviously
 no
 one
 here
 in
 the
 room
 would


disagree.
 It's
 a
 positive
 thing.


Everyone
 loves
 innovation.
 Um
 the
 moment


of
 truth
 is
 when
 it
 goes
 wrong.
 Mhm.


Okay.
 Because
 every
 time
 you
 try


something
 new
 um
 there
 is
 a
 certain
 risk


depending
 on
 what
 you're
 endeavoring
 to


do
 that
 it
 may
 fail
 and
 then
 what
 at


that
 moment
 and
 that
 separates
 in
 my


opinion
 the
 Sunday
 pep
 talk
 we
 all
 love


innovation
 from
 walking
 the
 talk.
 Um,
 so


if
 someone
 with
 the
 best
 of
 intentions,


no matter
 whether
 this
 is
 a
 diverse


leadership
 team
 or
 not,
 whether
 some
 if


someone
 with
 the
 best
 of
 intentions
 has


been
 trying
 to
 advance
 the
 organization,


has
 been
 trying
 new
 things,
 product


innovation,
 R&D,
 whatever,
 a
 new


marketing
 campaign
 and
 it
 falls
 flat.


How
 do
 you
 handle
 that
 situation?
 It's


usually
 bad
 news.
 It's
 usually
 something


that,
 you
 know,
 becomes
 visible.
 Uh,
 you


may
 have
 announced
 the
 product.
 Uh,
 you


may
 lose
 market
 share.
 you
 may
 not
 meet


your
 quarterly
 results
 but
 nonetheless
 I


mean
 those
 are
 the
 moments
 where
 all


these
 good
 attributes
 about
 culture
 and


you
 know
 integrity
 and
 being
 supportive


and
 all
 of
 that
 that's
 what's
 being
 put


to
 a
 test
 and
 if
 you
 then
 treat
 it
 like


the
 world
 is
 coming
 to
 an
 end
 people


will
 basically
 go
 back
 to
 their
 old


behaviors
 and
 uh
 this
 is
 what
 I
 talked


about
 earlier
 like
 moving
 away
 from
 the


accountability
 like
 it's
 someone
 else's


problem


you
 like
 to
 add
 anything
 to


that
 well
 in
 in
 Visma
 we
 we
 have
 a


difference
 between
 experiments
 and


projects
 and
 I
 would
 say
 that
 projects


are
 typically
 me
 delivering
 on
 the


budget
 uh
 that's
 something
 that
 we
 can't


miss
 but
 underneath
 the
 hood
 we
 can
 do
 a


lot
 of
 experiments


uh
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 agree
 that
 um
 it's
 how


you
 respond
 and
 how
 you
 drive
 the


business
 and
 actually
 figuring
 out
 that


experiments
 are
 great
 and
 we
 even


experiment
 on
 acquiring
 companies


Sometimes
 that
 goes
 wrong
 as
 well
 and


then
 it's
 more
 about
 what
 now
 how
 to
 how


to
 react
 because
 when
 things
 go
 wrong
 if


you
 fingerpoint
 and
 don't
 focus
 on
 okay


it's
 gone
 wrong
 what
 do
 we
 do
 now
 what


can
 we
 learn
 from
 this
 then
 we
 will


continue
 to
 innovate
 and
 experiment
 so


so
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 balancing
 act
 and
 it's


not
 a
 simple
 one
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 your


question
 on
 speed
 uh
 versus
 sort
 of


experimenting
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to


uh
 depending
 on
 the
 line
 of
 business


naturally
 but
 but but
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of


pilots
 going
 on
 and
 instead
 of
 making


everything
 perfect
 we
 let
 several


customers
 try
 the
 pilots
 and
 we
 get
 the


feedback
 and
 then
 we
 fail
 fast.
 So
 in


general
 when
 we
 have
 experience
 we
 know


that
 we
 have
 succeeded
 when
 we
 know
 if


it's
 a
 success
 or
 a
 failure
 instead
 of


waiting
 to
 the
 perfect
 launch
 h
 and
 then


suddenly
 things
 go
 wrong
 because
 then


you
 actually
 become
 more
 resilient
 and


you're
 able
 to
 do
 all
 these
 experiments


at
 once
 without
 this
 huge
 process
 that


actually
 underpins
 the
 results.
 So
 I


want
 to
 pick
 up
 on
 this
 concept
 because


you
 both
 represent
 different
 types
 of
 of


firms.
 Uh
 BISMA
 is
 relatively
 new.
 it's


still
 in
 high
 hyperrowth
 mode
 etc.
 You


spent
 many
 years
 at
 Nestle
 which
 is
 a


stable
 long-standing
 company.
 What
 at
 in


Nestle
 over
 the
 time
 that
 you
 were
 there


um
 what
 have
 you
 seen
 as
 some
 of
 the


biggest
 challenges?
 So
 I
 spoke
 about


crisis.
 What
 were
 some
 of
 the
 big


tumultuous
 events
 that
 you
 had
 to


navigate
 when
 you
 were
 at
 at
 Nestle?


Well,
 obviously
 a
 good
 one
 to
 talk
 about


in
 general
 that
 uh
 touched
 all
 companies


was
 uh
 how
 were
 you
 dealing
 with
 a
 once


in
 a
 century
 event
 like
 CO
 and
 um
 good


example
 of
 the
 power
 of
 decentralization


because
 there
 was
 no
 way
 from
 one
 place


on
 earth
 to
 try
 to
 manage
 that


situation.
 uh
 there's
 a
 few
 things
 that


you
 know
 you
 can
 give
 out
 as
 principles


like
 uh
 you
 know
 you
 trust
 that
 people


will
 follow
 those
 principles
 but
 uh
 all


the
 laws
 locally
 were
 different
 and
 um


the
 timelines
 were
 different
 and
 then


you
 really
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those


moments
 where
 in
 my
 opinion
 culture


shown
 because
 um
 you
 handle
 your
 own


situation
 in
 our
 case
 Switzerland
 where


the
 company
 is
 based
 and
 then
 you
 try
 to


place
 some
 of
 these
 principles
 in
 the


organization
 but
 then
 you
 have
 to
 trust


that
 in
 197
 countries
 people
 will
 make


it
 happen.
 one
 of
 the
 events
 I
 literally


remember
 from
 late
 2020.
 Um
 the
 first


time
 we
 were
 with
 all
 197
 back
 together


on
 a
 video.
 Um
 I
 wanted
 to
 talk
 about


the
 next
 stage
 of
 the
 crisis
 and
 um
 I


noticed
 everyone
 was
 talking
 about
 that


year
 and
 what
 it
 meant
 to
 them
 and
 I
 was


getting
 a
 little
 impatient
 and
 one
 of
 my


dear
 colleagues
 he
 was
 sort
 of
 tugging


me
 on
 the
 shirt
 and
 saying
 let
 them


talk.
 They
 need
 to
 talk.
 I
 mean
 they
 did


something
 really
 really
 amazing
 and
 that


is
 adjust
 to
 this
 once
 in
 a
 century


crisis
 with
 flying
 colors.
 Um
 they
 need


everyone
 have
 their
 traumatic
 experience


that
 need
 to
 talk
 and
 then
 we'll


transition
 to
 you
 know
 what
 are
 we
 doing


in
 2021.
 Um
 but
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those


where
 clearly
 in
 a
 broadbased
 global


cooperation


um
 if
 you're
 trying
 to
 handle
 this
 from


one
 place
 you'll
 fail
 and
 this
 is
 where


culture
 takes
 over.
 Absolutely.
 So
 if
 I


have
 my
 timing
 correct,
 you
 started
 at


Visma
 in
 2020.
 Uh
 the
 CEO
 2020.
 I


started
 in
 Visma
 in
 2011.
 Yes.
 But
 I


started
 as
 CEO
 CEO
 in
 2020
 when
 society


locked
 down.
 Right.
 So
 I
 wanted
 to
 I


want
 to
 have
 you
 talk
 about
 your


experience
 as
 a
 leader
 coming
 into
 an


environment.
 You'd
 been
 there.
 You
 you


had
 relationships,
 you
 knew
 the
 company,


but
 you
 were
 coming
 into
 the
 prominent


leadership
 role
 at
 the
 time
 when
 the


world
 was
 being
 turned
 upside
 down


because
 of
 the
 pandemic.
 Walk
 us
 through


how
 you
 observed
 culture
 helping
 Visma


navigate
 that
 time
 period
 and
 what
 role


you
 played
 as
 a
 leader
 in
 that.
 Well,
 it


was
 definitely
 special
 times.
 I
 think


all
 of
 us
 experienced
 that
 people
 need


to
 connect.
 They
 need
 to
 meet
 up
 and


that
 was
 close
 to
 impossible
 in
 that


time.
 So
 I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 having


meetings
 virtually
 naturally
 speaking
 to


the
 whole
 organization,
 speaking
 to
 the


different
 leadership,
 having
 tailored


meetings
 to
 the
 different
 countries


where
 we
 were
 in
 because
 there
 were


different
 challenges
 depending
 on
 where


you
 were.
 Uh
 we
 have
 some
 of
 our


companies
 that
 were
 were
 sort
 of
 um
 more


scared
 than
 others
 because
 people
 were


pulling
 out
 of
 some
 of
 the
 countries.
 So


it's
 I
 think
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 I


did
 was
 communicate,
 communicate,


communicate.
 Make
 sure
 that
 uh
 our


employees
 felt
 safe,
 that
 we
 would


continue,
 that
 we
 would
 do
 our
 business


as
 we
 always
 had
 done,
 being
 the
 safe


haven.
 Uh
 and
 addition
 uh
 taking
 care
 of


our
 local
 communities
 and
 our


customers.
 And
 we
 had
 been
 working


virtually
 a
 long
 time,
 naturally
 a
 tech


business,
 but
 our
 customers,
 so
 many
 of


them,
 they
 weren't
 used
 to
 this.
 So
 it


was
 an
 immense
 pressure
 on
 the
 employees


and
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 of
 course


making
 sure
 that
 especially
 customer


support
 they
 were
 so
 heavily
 loaded
 with


work
 uh
 trying
 to
 find
 these
 small


openings
 making
 sure
 that
 we
 have
 walk


and
 talk
 with
 people
 that
 move
 that
 live


close
 to
 to
 one
 another.
 We
 have
 mentors


coming
 around.
 So
 we
 did
 a
 lot
 of


operational
 things
 just
 being
 very
 close


to
 the
 organization
 speaking
 to
 people


speaking
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 speaking
 to


the
 talents
 uh
 and
 and
 in
 general
 I


guess
 you
 can
 say
 in
 a
 time
 like
 that


either
 the
 culture
 comes
 together
 or
 it


sort
 of
 falls
 apart
 and
 and
 luckily
 for


our
 sake
 we
 we
 really
 came
 together.
 I'm


I'm
 really
 proud
 of
 what
 we
 accomplished


but
 I'm
 so
 proud
 of
 what
 society


accomplished
 in
 such
 an
 immense
 shift.


Yeah.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 uh
 I
 teach


in
 business
 schools
 is
 culture
 and
 what


that
 actually
 means
 and
 where
 it
 comes


from
 and
 and
 Christian
 mentioned
 culture


eat
 strategy
 for
 breakfast
 which
 is


something
 that
 we've
 all
 heard
 um
 but
 we


don't
 often
 pay
 attention
 to
 how
 culture


is
 truly
 developed
 and
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 we
 explore
 with
 our
 students
 is


that
 culture
 is
 a
 component
 of
 three


different
 things.
 It's
 sort
 of


understanding
 the
 environment
 or
 the


context
 that
 your
 your
 company
 your


organization
 is
 in.
 It
 is
 the
 leadership


and
 the
 values
 that
 are
 propagated
 by


the
 leader
 but
 in
 that
 company
 and
 it's


about
 the
 strategy
 or
 the
 processes
 or


the
 policies
 that
 exist.
 And
 culture
 a


strong
 culture
 is
 created
 when
 all
 three


of
 those
 things
 are
 in
 alignment.
 when


the
 environmental
 context
 that
 your
 firm


is
 operating
 in
 is
 aligned
 with
 the


leadership
 values
 which
 is
 aligned
 with


the
 strategy
 and
 the
 policies
 that
 are


put
 in
 place
 and
 that's
 when
 you
 create


a
 strong
 culture
 and
 that's
 what
 leads


to
 results.
 Have
 you
 experienced
 or
 seen


times
 when
 there
 was
 a
 breakdown
 in
 the


alignment
 of
 those
 three
 areas
 that
 led


to
 challenges
 that
 you
 faced
 with


keeping
 the
 culture
 together?


I
 have
 to
 say
 I
 haven't.
 So,
 uh,
 going


back
 to
 when
 I
 became
 the
 CEO,
 2020


society
 locked
 down
 and
 I
 think
 from


2020
 up
 until
 now,
 it's
 been
 one
 extreme


after
 the
 other,
 I
 have
 to
 say.
 And


every
 time
 we
 we
 have
 been
 able
 to
 come


together
 and
 and
 work
 together,
 but
 it


does
 take
 a
 lot
 of
 time.
 Uh,
 making
 sure


that
 you
 just
 actively
 communicate
 and


make
 sure
 that
 people
 understand.
 Not


everyone
 needs
 to
 agree
 all
 the
 time.


Everyone
 has
 a
 voice,
 but
 not
 everyone


has
 a
 vote.
 But
 but
 just
 explaining


where
 we
 are,
 keeping
 calm,
 thoughtfully


prepared
 and
 ready
 to
 act
 and
 making


sure
 that
 people
 understand
 why
 we
 do


what
 we
 do.
 Um
 I
 I
 haven't
 had
 that


opportunity
 luckily
 I
 have
 to
 say.
 Uh


but
 maybe
 you
 have
 because
 you
 have
 been


a
 CEO
 longer
 than
 me.
 It's
 been
 longer.


But
 look,
 I
 also
 haven't
 witnessed
 that


complete
 meltdown.
 Uh
 do
 keep
 in
 mind
 I


agree
 the
 consistency
 is
 important
 to


bring
 all
 of
 these
 three
 dimensions
 in


alignment
 is
 not
 something
 that
 happens


on
 one
 day
 on
 a
 drawing
 board.
 It's


something
 that
 you
 kind
 of
 move
 over


time
 and
 then
 hopefully
 it
 stays
 close


to
 each
 other.
 Um
 and
 the
 minute


something
 price
 lose
 it's
 usually


because
 of
 some
 sort
 of
 change
 in
 the


environment.
 Something's
 changing
 your


industry,
 something's
 changing
 among


your
 people.
 um
 something
 that
 really


kind
 of
 brings
 it
 into
 a
 state
 of


imbalance.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 is
 important


then
 to
 react
 early
 to
 that
 before
 it


disintegrates.
 So
 it's
 one
 of
 those


where
 first
 you
 might
 just
 hear
 a
 little


noise
 and
 then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 goes
 poof


and
 so
 it's
 important
 to
 recognize
 that


early
 and
 do
 something
 about
 it
 because


afterwards
 it
 takes
 a
 long
 time
 to
 put


it
 back
 together
 again.
 Absolutely.
 We


have
 just
 a
 couple
 minutes
 left
 and
 I


want
 to
 ask
 a
 question
 for
 each
 of
 you


and
 that
 is
 as
 you
 reflect
 on
 your
 own


leadership


journey.
 Were
 there
 or
 has
 there
 been
 a


pivotal
 experience
 for
 you
 that
 really


was
 a
 demarcation
 in
 terms
 of
 being
 a


transformation
 to
 how
 you
 thought
 and


act
 as
 a
 as
 a
 leader?


Do
 you
 want
 to
 go
 first?
 Yeah.
 Um
 so


look
 when
 you
 mentioned
 micromanagement


earlier
 and
 uh
 talking
 about
 Nikolai


that
 kind
 of
 rang
 a
 bell
 with
 me
 and
 uh


it
 was
 a
 situation
 about
 um
 20
 21
 years


ago.
 It
 was
 my
 first
 year
 as
 CEO
 at


Fzenius
 and
 things
 were
 going
 incredibly


well.
 I
 was
 very
 proud
 of
 how
 things


were
 going.
 Had
 a
 fantastic
 relationship


with
 the
 chairman
 uh
 who's
 very


supportive
 and
 um
 gave
 me
 all
 the


support
 and
 advice
 and
 um
 and
 and


coaching
 I
 needed.
 and
 at
 one
 point


after
 a
 board
 meeting
 took
 me
 aside
 and


basically
 saying
 look
 I
 couldn't
 be


happier
 as
 a
 chair
 with
 you
 as
 a
 co


you're
 hardworking
 you're
 transparent


you're
 on
 top
 of
 the
 facts
 I'm
 not
 sure


I
 would
 want
 to
 be
 one
 of the
 people


working
 for


you
 okay
 nice
 to
 hear
 that
 from
 your


chairman
 um
 the
 way
 he
 shoed
 in
 it
 was


absolutely
 spoton
 because
 and
 this
 was


not
 out
 of
 bad
 intentions
 when
 you
 get


promoted
 to
 a
 job
 like
 this
 age
 37
 you


don't
 want
 to
 fail
 you
 working
 hard
 and


uh
 you
 you're
 basically
 trying
 to
 ensure


everything
 works
 just
 so
 and
 in
 that


process
 unfortunately
 you
 become
 too


prescriptive
 for
 the
 next
 people
 working


for
 you.
 So
 it's
 it's
 not
 out
 of
 bad


intentions.
 I
 don't
 think
 generally
 for


the
 rest
 of
 my
 career
 I
 was
 a


micromanager.
 It
 needed
 that
 nudge
 and


he
 had
 a
 point
 and
 I
 remember
 that
 was


probably
 the
 best
 cup
 of
 coffee
 in


business
 I
 ever
 had.
 I
 don't
 remember


what
 brand
 of
 coffee
 it
 was,
 but
 the


advice
 I
 got
 was
 super
 super
 helpful.


And
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that
 over
 the
 years,


uh,
 you
 know,
 as
 long
 as
 I'm
 convinced


that
 people
 are
 pulling
 in
 the
 same


direction,
 let
 them
 figure
 it
 out
 in


their
 ways
 and,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 they
 will


take
 the
 pride
 in
 it,
 it'll
 create
 more


allegiance
 to
 the
 business
 on
 their
 side


and
 uh,
 as
 um,
 you
 mentioned
 earlier,
 I


think,
 you
 know,
 that
 pride
 for
 as
 a


leader
 of
 them
 finding
 ways
 that
 you


weren't
 aware
 of,
 you
 know,
 that
 that's


something
 wonderful.
 No
 one
 has
 it
 all


the
 time,
 right?
 Absolutely.
 Anything


for
 you,
 Maretta?
 Uh,
 very
 quickly,
 I


think
 my
 most
 learning
 experience
 was
 I


hired
 a
 managing
 director
 back
 in
 the


days.
 He
 had
 been
 a
 CEO
 uh
 another


company.
 He
 had
 the
 whole
 strategy


planned
 out.
 He
 was
 amazing
 on
 all


aspects.
 But
 when
 he
 joined,
 he
 made
 all


the
 right
 decisions,
 but
 he
 wasn't
 able


to
 get
 the
 people
 along
 for
 the
 ride.


So,
 I
 had
 to
 fire
 that
 person
 one
 year


later.
 And
 uh
 for
 me
 that
 was
 a
 very


important
 learning
 experience.
 You
 have


to
 as
 a
 managing
 director,
 as
 a
 leader,


you
 have
 to
 make
 decisions
 with
 speed


and
 conviction.
 But
 if
 you
 don't
 get
 the


people
 along
 for
 the
 ride,
 h
 you're
 out


of
 a
 job.


Well
 said.
 Thank
 you
 both
 very
 much.
