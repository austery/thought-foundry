The
 Stanford
 commencement
 speech
 was


really
 exciting
 time
 because
 it
 marks


the
 end
 of
 medical
 school.
 One
 of the


things
 that
 I
 think
 medicine
 has
 really


taught
 me
 is
 the
 ability
 to
 identify
 out


of
 20
 patients
 you
 may
 be
 taking
 care
 of


who
 are
 the
 one
 or
 two
 patients
 that


need
 all
 your
 attention
 right
 now
 and


how
 do
 you
 really
 focus
 in
 an
 outsized


way
 on
 the
 couple
 of
 problems
 in
 this


case
 patients
 that
 matter
 the
 most.
 I


think
 being
 a
 founder
 is
 very
 similar


where
 when
 you're
 looking
 across
 maybe


20
 fires
 of
 the
 company,
 having
 the


ability
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 are
 the
 one


or
 two
 that
 you
 are
 most
 well
 suited
 to


solve
 and
 contribute
 to.
 So
 it's
 really


a
 matter
 of
 prioritization
 and
 of


knowing
 where
 to
 really
 pour
 your
 energy


into
 at
 any
 given
 time.
 I
 think
 one


piece
 of
 advice
 that's
 really
 helpful
 is


where
 are
 my
 unique
 strengths
 most


suited
 to
 have
 the
 most
 meaningful


contributions?


My
 name
 is
 Muella
 Gapen.
 I'm
 a
 physician


by
 training,
 but
 spent
 the
 early
 part
 of


my
 career
 as
 an
 AI
 researcher
 at


Stanford
 and
 have
 spent
 the
 last
 many


years
 building
 health
 technology


companies.
 I'm
 the
 founder
 and
 CEO
 at


Council
 Health.
 Council
 Health
 is
 an
 AI


enabled
 virtual
 care
 company.
 We're


redefining
 virtual
 care
 for
 the
 modern


era.
 And
 our
 hope
 is
 that
 we
 can


multiply
 the
 world's
 clinical
 capacity


by
 creating
 perfect
 doctors
 to
 deliver


the
 highest
 quality
 care
 to
 the
 next
 10


billion
 people.
 What
 many
 patients


describe
 to
 us
 as
 feeling
 like
 they
 have


a
 doctor
 in
 their
 pocket.
 We're
 really


excited
 to
 announce
 our
 $25
 million


series
 A
 co-led
 by
 Andre
 Horowitz
 A16Z


and
 GV.


Growing
 up,
 I
 had
 a
 speech
 impediment


where
 I
 couldn't
 say
 the
 letter
 R.
 And
 I


distinctly
 remember
 sitting
 in
 class
 and


hoping
 the
 teacher
 wouldn't
 call
 on
 me


to
 read
 out
 loud
 the
 sections.
 And
 I
 I


actually
 remember
 counting
 the
 number
 of


Rs
 in
 a
 given
 sentence
 to
 see
 which


sentence
 I
 should
 volunteer
 to
 read
 to


avoid,
 you
 know,
 being
 embarrassed.


Later
 in
 my
 life
 did
 a
 lot
 of
 public


speaking
 and
 speech
 and
 debate.
 And
 to


me
 that
 was
 mostly
 a
 form
 of
 building


conviction
 in
 a
 growth
 mindset
 and
 the


idea
 that
 just
 because
 something
 is


broken
 or
 doesn't
 work
 or
 isn't
 the
 way


you
 want
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 it
 can't


be
 solved.
 And
 in
 a
 way
 that
 personal


lesson
 of
 going
 from
 something
 becoming


an
 impediment
 to
 eventually
 being
 a


strength.
 So
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 Houston
 which


is
 the
 home
 to
 the
 world's
 largest


medical
 center
 another
 place
 with
 some


of
 the
 best
 cancer
 hospitals,
 teaching


hospitals,
 medical
 schools.
 And
 when
 you


grow
 up
 in
 that
 environment
 and
 you


still
 see
 cracks
 in
 the
 foundation,
 you


still
 see
 misdiagnosis,
 challenges
 with


access,
 weight
 times,
 diagnostic
 errors.


you
 start
 to
 realize
 that
 even
 the
 best


that
 we've
 ever
 created,
 the
 best


medical
 centers,
 the
 best
 hospitals,
 the


best
 doctors
 are
 still
 not
 quite
 at


either
 the
 quality
 or
 capacity
 that
 we


need
 to
 serve
 the
 broader
 uh
 US
 and


global
 healthcare
 needs.
 There's
 a


couple
 of
 times
 where
 I've
 felt
 the
 way


we
 practice
 medicine
 today
 is
 just
 not


good
 enough.
 And
 I
 remember
 many
 times


being
 in
 clinic
 as
 a
 primary
 care


physician,
 having
 a
 patient
 sit
 in
 front


of
 me
 and
 explain
 their
 problems
 and


knowing
 that
 there
 is
 some
 limitation
 I


have
 in
 my
 memory,
 my
 recall,
 in
 my


ability
 to
 connect
 the
 dots
 that
 was


preventing
 me
 from
 helping
 this
 person


in
 the
 best
 way
 possible.
 Humans
 were


working
 off
 fallible
 memory,
 off
 logical


and
 cognitive
 biases.
 We
 may
 be
 hungry


before
 lunch
 and
 that's
 making
 us
 feel


rushed
 with
 a
 particular
 patient.
 You're


dealing
 with
 life
 or
 death
 decisions.


Patients
 being
 rushed
 in
 with
 a
 heart


attack.
 Being
 alone
 in
 the
 ICU
 at
 2
 a.m.


with
 a
 patient
 whose
 blood
 pressure
 is


falling
 and
 who
 is
 not
 responding
 to
 any


medications.
 How
 do
 you
 comfort
 a
 family


member
 who's
 grieving
 the
 loss
 of
 their


son
 or
 daughter?
 And
 it
 felt
 like
 all
 of


these
 were
 shortcomings.
 You
 know,
 I


often
 felt
 guilty
 at
 the
 end
 of
 each


clinic
 day
 realizing
 that
 if
 I
 had
 a


perfect
 memory,
 if
 I
 had
 read
 every


journal
 article,
 if
 I
 had
 infinite
 time,


I
 could
 help
 these
 people
 so
 much
 better


than
 I
 was.
 I
 remember
 practicing


medicine
 and
 wanting
 to
 have
 an
 impact


on
 people,
 but
 feeling
 like
 that
 impact


was
 constrained
 to
 one
 patient
 at
 a


time,
 one
 visit
 at
 a
 time.
 I've
 been


fortunate
 in
 my
 career
 where
 I've
 gone


into
 the
 depths
 of
 both
 clinical
 AI
 and


AI
 research,
 but
 also
 the
 practice
 of


medicine.
 Having
 two
 depths
 of


experience,
 one
 in
 AI,
 one
 in
 medicine.


And
 one
 of the
 things
 I
 was
 really


excited
 about
 when
 transitioning
 from


clinical
 medicine
 into
 technology
 was


the
 ability
 to
 scale
 impact.
 The
 ability


to
 help
 people
 not
 one
 at
 a
 time
 but
 at


a
 large
 magnitude
 where
 a
 single


software
 application,
 a
 single
 new


algorithm,
 a
 new
 technique
 could


suddenly
 help
 millions
 of
 people
 or


billions
 of
 people.
 And
 that's
 what


first
 led
 me
 to
 move
 away
 from
 daily


practice
 in
 medicine
 to
 helping
 build


technology
 companies
 that
 could
 have


this
 large-scale
 paradigm
 shifting


change
 on
 healthcare
 overall.


[Music]


Many
 of
 the
 AI
 solutions
 being
 worked
 on


in
 healthcare
 were
 improving
 doctor's


capacity
 by
 maybe
 10%
 or
 20%.
 But
 what


that
 actually
 translates
 to
 then
 is


instead
 of
 seeing
 four
 patients
 an
 hour,


you're
 maybe
 only
 able
 to
 see
 five


patients
 an
 hour.
 And
 while
 that
 is
 a


meaningful
 improvement,
 we
 felt
 like
 it


wasn't
 enough
 to
 truly
 make
 a
 difference


in
 the
 access
 to
 care,
 in
 the
 quality
 of


care,
 in
 how
 personalized
 care
 was.


Speeding
 up
 doctors
 by
 20%
 wasn't
 going


to
 solve
 that
 problem.
 And
 so
 we
 really


wanted
 to
 go
 at
 the
 root
 cause
 of
 the


problem,
 which
 is
 not
 how
 do
 you
 do


administrative
 work
 faster,
 but
 how
 do


you
 actually
 deliver
 care
 itself
 faster,


higher
 quality,
 more
 personalized.
 So
 we


set
 out
 on
 this
 mission
 to
 think
 in


multiples,
 not
 percentages.
 What
 does
 it


look
 like
 to
 10x
 the
 world's
 clinical


supply?
 We
 had
 a
 choice
 of
 do
 we
 want
 to


build
 software
 that
 tried
 to
 practice


medicine
 on
 its
 own
 or
 one
 that


augmented
 existing
 doctors
 and
 we
 felt


really
 strongly
 that
 the
 right
 care


model
 here
 would
 be
 one
 that
 combined
 AI


with
 human
 doctors
 for
 supervision
 and


guidance
 such
 that
 you
 get
 the
 best
 of


both
 worlds.
 We
 believe
 either
 alone
 is


insufficient.
 AI
 only
 chat
 bots
 have
 the


problem
 of
 hallucination,
 a
 lack
 of


supervision
 and
 a
 lack
 of
 ability
 to


actually
 action
 on
 the
 advice
 they
 give.


And
 human
 doctors
 have
 the
 fundamental


laws
 of
 physics
 that
 constrain
 their


ability
 to
 see
 enough
 patients
 with


enough
 quality
 in
 a
 given
 time.
 We


started
 thinking
 about
 our
 AI


augmentation
 as
 a
 sort
 of
 iron
 man
 suit


for
 our
 clinicians.
 Imagine
 a
 physician


that
 can
 supercharge
 their
 own


abilities.
 You
 know,
 essentially
 obtain


these
 clinical
 superpowers
 by
 using
 our


AI
 platform.
 They
 could
 suddenly


remember
 every
 article
 they've
 ever


read.
 They
 could
 review
 a
 patient's


chart,
 even
 if
 it's
 hundreds
 of
 pages,


within
 seconds.
 And
 the
 other
 unique


thing
 about
 council
 is
 that
 we
 built
 our


own
 physician
 group
 in
 house.
 So
 today


we
 run
 and
 operate
 a
 50-st
 state
 medical


practice
 with
 our
 own
 employed


physicians.
 And
 the
 reason
 that's


important
 is
 it
 means
 we
 control
 not


only
 the
 iron
 man
 suit
 but
 the
 iron
 men


and
 women
 themselves
 and
 we
 can
 truly


create
 the
 best
 combination
 of
 human
 and


AI
 working
 together.
 Many
 patients


describe
 to
 us
 as
 feeling
 like
 they
 have


a
 doctor
 in
 their
 pocket.
 I've
 often


tried
 to
 make
 decisions
 where
 are
 my


strengths
 was
 really
 important
 to
 solve


some
 of
 the
 hardest
 challenges
 ahead
 in


the
 world
 of
 clinical
 AI.
 It's
 because


these
 problems
 aren't
 specific
 to
 a


single
 domain.
 They
 sort
 of
 cross
 over


between
 both
 domains.
 It
 requires
 you
 to


understand
 how
 do
 doctors
 do
 it
 today,


but
 also
 requires
 you
 to
 understand
 the


art
 of
 the
 possible
 with
 AI.
 If
 you
 only


understood
 one
 of
 those
 two
 disciplines,


you
 would
 be
 fundamentally
 constrained


both
 in
 the
 creativity
 but
 also
 the


depth
 of
 the
 types
 of
 solutions
 you


could
 create.
 And
 we
 all
 have
 different


strengths.
 But
 where
 are
 my
 unique


strengths
 most
 suited
 to
 have
 the
 most


meaningful
 contributions
 in
 startups?


This
 is
 often
 called
 founder
 market
 fit.


But
 where
 are
 you
 as
 a
 founder
 best


suited
 to
 solve
 a
 particular
 market


challenge?


One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 found
 as
 a


founder
 is
 there
 are
 always
 so
 many


fires
 so
 to
 speak
 going
 on
 at
 the


company
 or
 in
 the
 business
 and
 it's


really
 impossible
 to
 devote
 your
 full


attention
 to
 all
 of
 those
 fires
 at
 one


time
 and
 if
 you
 try
 you
 end
 up
 doing
 a


subpar
 job
 across
 the
 board.
 One
 of
 the


things
 that
 I
 think
 medicine
 has
 really


taught
 me
 is
 the
 ability
 to
 identify
 out


of
 20
 patients
 you
 may
 be
 taking
 care


of,
 who
 are
 the
 one
 or
 two
 patients
 that


need
 all
 your
 attention
 right
 now.
 And


how
 do
 you
 really
 focus
 in
 an
 outsized


way
 on
 the
 couple
 of
 problems,
 in
 this


case
 patients,
 that
 matter
 the
 most?


When
 building
 a
 company
 like
 Council


Health,
 there
 are
 two
 themes
 constantly


in
 tension.
 One
 is
 the
 medical
 theme
 and


premise
 of
 do
 no
 harm,
 the
 hypocratic


oat,
 and
 the
 other
 is
 the
 startup
 adage


of
 move
 fast
 and
 break
 things.
 The
 idea


that
 only
 by
 taking
 risks
 and
 moving


quickly
 can
 you
 truly
 unlock
 innovation


at
 scale.
 When
 building
 a
 medical
 AI


care
 delivery
 platform
 like
 council,


those
 two
 things
 could
 be
 at
 odds.
 But


we
 found
 a
 really
 elegant
 way
 to
 resolve


them.
 First
 and
 foremost,
 we
 focus
 on
 do


no
 harm.
 How
 do
 we
 ensure
 that


everything
 we
 deploy,
 every
 aspect
 of


the
 care
 model,
 not
 only
 has
 physician


supervision
 baked
 in,
 but
 also
 has
 been


evaluated
 and
 tested
 to
 be
 highquality,


safe,
 and
 at
 the
 very
 least
 exceeding


the
 performance
 of
 the
 world's
 very
 best


doctors.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 because
 we


have
 an
 in-house
 physician
 group,
 we're


able
 to
 safeguard
 our
 AI
 where
 we
 can


have
 our
 AI
 take
 risks,
 be
 more


innovative
 in
 the
 way
 the
 AI
 is


suggesting
 diagnoses
 and
 reviewing
 the


literature,
 knowing
 that
 all
 of
 those


things
 will
 be
 safeguarded
 and


supervised
 by
 a
 physician
 in
 the
 loop.


In
 that
 way,
 we
 get
 to
 enjoy
 the
 best
 of


both
 worlds.
 We
 get
 to
 make
 sure
 the
 end


patient
 experiences
 no
 harm,
 yet
 at
 the


same
 time,
 we
 can
 have
 our
 AI
 push
 the


boundaries
 of
 what
 AI
 is
 capable
 of.


The
 world
 as
 we
 know
 it
 in
 healthcare


and
 most
 industries
 will
 probably
 change


fundamentally
 over
 the
 next
 5
 years.


There's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 massive


reshuffleling
 of
 norms
 and
 paradigms.


The
 way
 we
 interact
 with
 a
 lawyer,
 a


doctor,
 an
 accountant,
 even
 an
 investor


will
 change
 greatly
 in
 the
 next
 5
 years.


We
 even
 wonder
 sometimes
 will
 we
 tell


our
 children
 in
 20
 or
 30
 years
 about


this
 concept
 of
 primary
 care
 doctors
 and


will
 they
 look
 at
 us
 with
 sort
 of


admiration
 and
 wonder
 at
 this
 idea
 that


there
 was
 only
 a
 single
 person
 and
 they


didn't
 really
 remember
 your
 medical


records
 and
 if
 you
 traveled
 you
 couldn't


really
 get
 access
 to
 them
 and
 maybe
 one


day
 that'll
 all
 feel
 a
 bit


old-fashioned.
 Not
 solving
 perhaps
 for


the
 next
 5
 years
 but
 solving
 for
 what


the
 world
 will
 look
 like
 as
 a
 result
 of


this
 reshuffleling.
 If
 it's
 the
 case


that
 everyone
 is
 accessing
 care
 via


their
 phone,
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 in


terms
 of
 computational
 and
 video
 needs


on
 a
 phone?
 What
 does
 that
 mean
 for
 how


we
 structureies?


Don't
 act
 like
 you
 hit
 a
 triple
 when
 you


were
 born
 on
 third
 base.


While
 today
 is
 a
 celebration,
 I
 think


it's
 also
 a
 recognition
 that
 in
 one
 way


or
 another,
 we
 were
 all
 born
 on
 third


base.


>> You
 know,
 so
 many
 of
 us
 are
 born
 with
 so


many
 things
 that
 we're
 fortunate
 for,


that
 we've
 been
 sort
 of
 gifted.
 And
 in


my
 mind,
 I
 view
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 as
 a


responsibility
 to
 then
 give
 back,
 not


just
 proportionally,
 but
 even
 in
 an


outsized
 way.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


what
 motivates
 me
 is
 giving
 back
 in
 a


way
 that
 feels
 outsized
 to
 what's
 been


given
 to
 me
 in
 terms
 of
 opportunities,


in
 terms
 of
 the
 people
 I've
 met,
 the


education
 I've
 been
 able
 to
 receive.
