>> THE TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKER
PROGRAM IS FACING CRITICISM
FROM THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT.
SOME PEOPLE THINK THE PROGRAM
SHOULD BE REFORMED, SOME THINK
IT SHOULD BE CUT ALL TOGETHER.
DOES THE COUNTRY NEED IT? I SAT
DOWN WITH MIKAL SKUTERUD, AN
ECONOMICS PROFESSOR AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO, AND
ELIZABETH LONG, AN IMMIGRATION
LAWYER AND A PARTNER AT LM LAW
GROUP.
[MUSIC]
ELIZABETH MIKAL, NICE TO HAVE
YOU ON OUR PROGRAM. THANK YOU
FOR MAKING IT TO OUR MAKESHIFT
STUDIOS. THE TEMPORARY FOREIGN
WORKER PROGRAM HAS COME UNDER
FIRE ON ALL POLITICAL SPECTRUMS.
FOR INSTANCE, THE CONSERVATIVE
LEADER PIERRE POILIEVRE, AS
WELL AS BC'S NDP PREMIERE DAVID
EBY ALL CALLING IT FOR IT TO BE
SCRAPPED AS A RESULT, SAYING
IT'S RESULTED IN RATHER HIGH
YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT. IS THIS
CRITICISM JUSTIFIED?
>> THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO
QUESTION THAT THE GROWTH WE'VE
SEEN IN YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS
NOT A CONSEQUENCE, A CAUSE OF
THE TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKER
PROGRAM, THE GROWTH WE'VE SEEN
IN YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS A
CONSEQUENCE OF A DRAMATIC
DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF JOB
VACANCIES IN CANADA. IN THE
SUMMER OF 2022. WE HAD. YOU MAY
REMEMBER THE HEADLINES. WE HAD
ALMOST A MILLION JOB VACANCIES
IN CANADA OVER THE FOLLOWING
THREE YEARS. THEY'VE DROPPED BY
MORE THAN 50%. SO WE NOW HAVE
LESS THAN HALF A HALF A MILLION
JOB VACANCIES. THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE GOING TO STRUGGLE ARE THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO FIND A
JOB. WHEN THERE ARE NO NEW JOBS
BEING CREATED, NEW LABOUR MARKET
ENTRANTS LIKE YOUNG PEOPLE AND
NEW IMMIGRANTS ARE GOING TO
FEEL THAT THE MOST. AND THAT'S
WHERE WE SEE THE BIGGEST
INCREASES IN UNEMPLOYMENT.
>> ELIZABETH.
>> AND REMEMBER, THE TEMPORARY
FOREIGN WORKER PROGRAM PROBABLY
CONSISTS OF ONLY ONE TENTH OF
THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WORK PERMIT
HOLDERS THAT ARE HERE IN CANADA.
MOST WORK PERMIT HOLDERS HAVE
OPEN WORK PERMITS. THEY'RE NOT
PART OF THE TEMPORARY FOREIGN
WORKER PROGRAM. IN FACT, THE
TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKER
PROGRAM IS THE MOST SCRUTINIZED
AREA FOR WORK PERMITS. THE
EMPLOYERS ACTUALLY HAVE TO TRY
TO PROVE THAT THEY CAN'T FIND
CANADIANS WHO CAN DO THE JOB.
SO IF WE'RE LOOKING AT JUST
NUMBERS, THE TEMPORARY FOREIGN
WORKER PROGRAM FORMS SUCH A
SMALL SUBSET OF THE JUST EVEN
TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKERS IN
CANADA.
>> IS THAT WE TALK ABOUT HOW
SMALL OF A PERCENTAGE IT IS.
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT
THIS PROGRAM, IN ITS 50 PLUS
YEARS OF EXISTENCE, HAS BEEN
SCRUTINIZED. WHAT IS IT ABOUT
THE PROGRAM THAT SEEMS TO BE
THE SORT OF THE OBVIOUS SORT OF
REASON PEOPLE ARE PICKING AT IT.
>> SO IT'S NOT RANDOM. WHEN IT
BECOMES CONTROVERSIAL, IT
BECOMES CONTROVERSIAL WHEN THE
PROGRAM IS GROWING. AT THE SAME
TIME AS UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ARE
RISING, THE OPTICS OF THE
PROGRAM DON'T MAKE SENSE TO
PEOPLE AT THE TIME FOR GOOD
REASON. SO, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
SEE YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND YOU
SEE DRAMATIC GROWTH IN THIS
PROGRAM, WHICH WE HAVE SEEN IN
RECENT YEARS, YOU KNOW, THE
EMPLOYERS DO HAVE TO GO THROUGH
THIS TEST TO SHOW THAT THEY
CAN'T HIRE A DOMESTICALLY. THAT
TEST HAS BECOME A RUBBER STAMP.
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA, THE
APPROVAL RATES WERE REACHING
OVER 98%. I MEAN, THEY WERE
JUST RUBBER STAMPING. AND SO
THE GROWTH IN RECENT YEARS HAS
JUST BEEN TREMENDOUS. AND THE
OPTICS OF THAT ARE NOT GOOD.
IT'S A SMALL PROGRAM, BUT IT
DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE TO BE
GROWING THIS PROGRAM AT A TIME
WHEN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS
RISING.
>> ALL RIGHT, ELIZABETH, I WANT
TO QUOTE THE PREMIERE IN B.C.
SAID, WE CAN'T HAVE AN
IMMIGRATION PROGRAM THAT
RESULTS IN HIGH YOUTH
UNEMPLOYMENT, IS THE INCREASE
IN THE NUMBER OF TEMPORARY
RESIDENTS, MAKING IT MORE
DIFFICULT FOR YOUNGER CANADIANS
TO FIND EMPLOYMENT. I HEAR
ANECDOTALLY FROM PEOPLE ACROSS
THIS PROVINCE WHO ARE SAYING,
MY DAUGHTER, YOU KNOW, MY SON
IS STRUGGLING TO FIND A JOB. IS
THERE AN ACTUAL CORRELATION
BETWEEN THE TWO?
>> WELL, I THINK WE HAVE TO
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE NUMBER
OF OVERALL PEOPLE WHO ARE IN
CANADA, WHO HAVE OPEN WORK
PERMITS FROM THE TEMPORARY
FOREIGN WORKER PROGRAM, THE
TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKER
PROGRAM. THE GOVERNMENT HAS
WORKED SINCE LAST YEAR TO
DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER
OF PEOPLE WHO CAN QUALIFY FOR
IT. FOR THE MOST PART, RIGHT
NOW, PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE TO
QUALIFY TO EMPLOYERS ARE ABLE
TO QUALIFY TO EVEN APPLY. THEY
HAVE TO HAVE SALARIES OF HIGH
WAGE, WHICH IN MOST PLACES ARE
WELL OVER $30 AN HOUR. SO THOSE
KIND OF JOBS AREN'T REALLY THE
KIND OF JOBS THAT COMPETE WITH
ENTRY LEVEL JOBS. THAT YOUTH
UNEMPLOYMENT SEEMS TO GROW IN
THESE KIND OF SITUATIONS. SO IF
WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT THE
TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKER
PROGRAM, THERE ARE A LOT OF
ISSUES. AND I AGREE, THERE ARE
A LOT OF ISSUES WITH TEMPORARY
FOREIGN WORKER PROGRAM. I AGREE
THAT FOR A LOT OF PARTS. THE
EXAMINATION OF THE RECRUITMENT
MAY NOT BE. IT'S KIND OF
ARTIFICIAL. WHEN YOU ASK THE
EMPLOYERS TO RECRUIT, TRY TO
RECRUIT CANADIANS WHEN THEY
HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED SOMEONE
IN THEIR MIND, IS THIS
RECRUITMENT REALLY REAL, OR IS
IT MORE OF A SORT OF RITUAL, A
SORT OF A RECRUITMENT
REQUIREMENT THAT IS ARTIFICIAL?
>> CAN YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE
OF WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE IN
A PARTICULAR JOB FIELD?
>> RIGHT. SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF AN
EMPLOYER WANTS TO APPLY FOR A
LAB OR MARKET IMPACT ASSESSMENT,
WHICH IS THE BASIS OF THE
TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKER
PROGRAM, THEY WOULD HAVE TO
UNDERGO VERY RESTRICTIVE
ADVERTISING. SO THEY WOULD HAVE
TO ADVERTISE ON THE JOB BANK.
THEY WOULD HAVE TO ADVERTISE IN
AT LEAST TWO OTHER PLACES IN
LABOUR
CANADA. AND ON THE
ADVERTISEMENTS THERE. THE
WORDING ON IT IS VERY SPECIFIC.
SO YOU HAVE TO PUT THINGS LIKE
WHAT LANGUAGE IS SPOKEN IN THE
WORKPLACE, WHAT YOU KNOW, WHAT
DUTIES THERE ARE AND WAGES,
ETC. AND A LOT OF TIMES FOR
EMPLOYERS, THIS IS NOT THE
NORMAL WAY THAT THEY WOULD GO
ABOUT FINDING SOMEONE. BUT FOR
THE MOST PART, EMPLOYERS WHO
COME TO US IF THEY WANT TO GO
THROUGH THE TEMPORARY FOREIGN
WORKER PROGRAM, WE WOULD HAVE
TO ASK THEM TO RE-ADVERTISE
OTHERWISE THEIR APPLICATIONS
WOULD BE DENIED. AND SO A LOT
OF TIMES, THIS PROGRAM CREATES
A SITUATION WHERE THIS
ARTIFICIAL PART OF IT DOESN'T
MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. THERE ARE
BETTER WAYS TO GET LAB OR MARKET
BENEFITS THAN FORCING THIS
ARTIFICIAL RECRUITMENT.
>> ON A NOTE THAT ELIZABETH
MENTIONED EARLIER, THERE IS
THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT
TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKERS HOLD
LOWER PAYING JOBS, AND IF THE
PROGRAM WAS SCRAPPED, CANADIANS
MIGHT NOT BE WILLING TO FILL
THOSE ONES. IS THAT A FAIR
ASSUMPTION?
>> SO THE BIGGEST PART OF THE
GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM IN RECENT
YEARS HAS BEEN IN JOBS THAT
REQUIRE HIGH SCHOOL OR LESS. SO
IT IS TRUE THIS GROWTH HAS
MOSTLY BEEN VERY LOW SKILLED
WORK. YOU KNOW, WOULD THESE
JOBS BE FILLED BY BY BY YOUNG
CANADIANS IF THE PROGRAM WAS
SHUT DOWN? I WOULDN'T THINK OF
IT LIKE THAT. I MEAN, THAT'S
THE WRONG WAY TO THINK ABOUT
HOW ECONOMIES WORK, THAT JOBS
ARE JUST FIXED THINGS, THAT
SOMEBODY HAS TO FILL THIS
SLAUGHTER, THE WHOLE ECONOMY
STARTS TO FALL APART. IT'S JUST
NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK
ABOUT IT. HOW ECONOMIES WORK,
YOU KNOW, TIGHT LAB OR MARKETS,
WE TALK ABOUT THEM LIKE THEY'RE
A PROBLEM. THEY'RE ACTUALLY
VERY GOOD FOR AN ECONOMY,
ESPECIALLY IN AN ECONOMY THAT
STRUGGLES WITH PRODUCTIVITY
LIKE CANADA DOES. WHAT A TIGHT
LAB OR MARKET DOES IS IT FORCES
EMPLOYERS TO WORK A LOT HARDER
TO TRY AND ATTRACT SCARCE
WORKERS, TO TRY AND IMPROVE
WORKING CONDITIONS, TO TRY AND
IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY, TO INVEST
IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES, TO GET
MORE OUT OF THE WORKERS THAT
YOU CURRENTLY HAVE. THESE ARE
ALL THINGS CANADA IS IN
DESPERATE NEED OF. SO THAT'S
THE SENSE IN WHICH THE
TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKER
PROGRAM IS NOT A HUGE PROGRAM,
BUT THERE'S NO SINGLE SOLUTION
THAT'S GOING TO SOLVE CANADA'S
PRODUCTIVITY PROBLEMS. AND THIS
IS JUST PART OF THAT SYSTEM OF
MOVING THE DIAL IN A WAY THAT'S
NOT CODDLING BUSINESS IN THE
WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR
MANY YEARS.
>> ELIZABETH, DO YOU WANT TO
WEIGH IN ON THAT?
>> YEAH. SO THE TEMPORARY
FOREIGN WORKER PROGRAM HAS TWO
SUBSETS. THERE ARE THE WORK,
LIKE SEASONAL AGRICULTURAL WORK,
YOU KNOW, FACTORY WORK,
SOMETIMES RESTAURANTS IN, YOU
KNOW, NORTHERN OR LESS
POPULATED AREAS WHERE THEY JUST
CAN'T FIND WORKERS, THEY CAN'T
FIND BODIES TO DO THIS WORK.
NOW, THIS HAS BEEN SEVERELY
RESTRICTED RECENTLY BY THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR THE
MOST PART OF CANADA, THERE ARE
SOME RURAL AREAS WHERE THERE
AND SOME AREAS LIKE
CONSTRUCTION WHERE THERE ARE
STILL EXEMPTIONS. THE OTHER
PART OF IT ARE THE VERY HIGHLY
SPECIALIZED KIND OF WORK, YOU
KNOW, CERTAIN KINDS OF
ENGINEERS, CERTAIN KIND OF
SCIENTISTS, WHERE SOMEONE, THE
EMPLOYER JUST CAN'T FIND THOSE
KIND OF SKILLS TO DO THE WORK.
NOW WE HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED
THE GLOBAL TALENT STREAM, WHICH
IS A SUBSET OF THE LMIA THAT
TARGETS STEM WORKERS. SO
ENGINEERS, SCIENTISTS AND THESE
KIND OF THIS PROGRAM IS UNIQUE
IN THAT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE
EMPLOYER TO HAVE THAT SORT OF
ARTIFICIAL RECRUITMENT. THAT
PROGRAM INSTEAD SAYS, WELL,
EMPLOYER, YOU WANT TO HIRE THIS
HIGHLY SPECIALIZED WORKER. WE
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A
SHORTAGE OF THESE OCCUPATIONS,
BUT CERTAINLY YOU HAVE TO PAY
THE MEDIAN WAGE FOR THE
OCCUPATION. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
DEPRESS ANY WAGES. BUT ALSO WE
WANT YOU TO PROVIDE A LAB OR
MARKET BENEFIT PLAN WHERE
YOU'RE GOING TO PROVIDE THREE
LAB OR MARKET BENEFITS, SUCH AS
YOU'RE GOING TO BE HIRING MORE
CANADIANS. SO IF YOU'RE GOING
TO HIRE THIS FOREIGN WORKER,
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU'RE GOING TO
HIRE ANOTHER CANADIAN AS WELL.
YOU'RE GOING TO INVEST MONEY IN
TRAINING CANADIANS AND SO
ON AND SO ON. SO THIS PROGRAM
IS A VERY INTERESTING PROGRAM
TO ME BECAUSE IT CUTS AWAY FROM
THE ARTIFICIALITY OF THE
RECRUITMENT. AND IN THE
MEANTIME, IT MAKES THE EMPLOYER,
IF YOU REALLY NEED THIS PERSON,
TO ACTUALLY ALSO GO AND PROMISE
TO ADD LAB OR MARKET BENEFITS.
AND IT'S BEEN A VERY POPULAR
PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S FAST AS
WELL.
>> DO YOU WANT TO CHIME IN?
>> THAT'S HUGELY IMPORTANT. I
MEAN, THAT'S A BIG PART OF THE
PROBLEM. THIS PROGRAM EXISTS AS
A WAY TO RECRUIT TALENT FROM
ABROAD. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT
EXAMPLE OF WHERE THIS PROGRAM
DOES NOT NEED TO BE SHUT DOWN.
THIS IS EXACTLY AS THE US LOOKS
TO SHUT DOWN THE HO-1B PROGRAM.
THIS IS THE ROUTE TO TO RECRUIT
PEOPLE, GET THEM ON THE GROUND
RUNNING VERY QUICKLY. YOU KNOW,
THIS IS A VERY MIXED PROGRAM.
THERE ARE PARTS OF IT THAT NEED
TO BE CURTAILED, PERHAPS EVEN
PHASED OUT, BUT THIS IS NOT ONE
OF THEM.
>> IF YOU HAD THE EAR OF
IMMIGRATION MINISTER LENA DIAB,
IF THERE WAS ONE CHANGE THAT
YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO THE
PROGRAM, WHAT WOULD THAT BE?
>> SO I THINK THE LOW SKILL
STREAMS NEED TO BE PHASED OUT.
THE COST HERE IS THAT EVERY
TIME THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE GOES
UP, THIS BECOMES A BIG ISSUE,
RIGHT? THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE
CANADIAN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.
WHEN PEOPLE START NOT TRUSTING
THE SYSTEM, QUESTIONING
IMMIGRATION IN GENERAL BECAUSE
OF A PROGRAM THAT'S ACTUALLY
QUITE SMALL, THAT'S NOT WORKING
RIGHT. WE GOT TO DO THIS
DIFFERENTLY. WE GOT TO STOP
THIS CYCLE OF THIS PROGRAM
BECOMING SO CONTENTIOUS. AND
THE WAY TO DO IT, I THINK, IS
THERE IS A PRICE THAT EMPLOYERS
HAVE TO PAY WHEN THEY HIRE A
TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKER. THEY
PAY $1,000 PER POSITION THROUGH
THIS LMIA. THAT'S A REALLY
INTERESTING POLICY INSTRUMENT
THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN USE. SO
THEY CAN, YOU KNOW, INCREASE
THE PRICE. WHERE UNEMPLOYMENT
RATES ARE HIGHER, THEY CAN
INCREASE THE PRICE WHERE WE
THINK THERE ARE OCCUPATIONS
THAT ARE MORE SLACK. BUT I
THINK THE MAIN THING YOU CAN DO
IS YOU WANT TO ENSURE
BUSINESSES AREN'T USING THIS AS
KIND OF A BUSINESS STRATEGY,
YOU KNOW, TRYING TO GET PROFIT
MARGINS BY KEEPING YOUR LABOUR
COSTS LOW. THAT'S NOT WHERE WE
WANT TO GO WITH THIS. SO WHERE
YOU SEE EMPLOYERS REPEATEDLY
YEAR AFTER YEAR USING THIS
PROGRAM, YOU CAN ESCALATE THE
PRICE. SO THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR
AN LMIA GETS HIGHER AND HIGHER
EVERY YEAR. TO KIND OF WEAN
THESE BUSINESSES OFF, I THINK
OVER A 3 TO 5 YEAR HORIZON. I'D
LIKE TO SEE THE LOW WAGE
STREAMS GET PHASED OUT.
>> OKAY, ELIZABETH.
>> I THINK THERE ARE SOME
NUANCES TO THIS BECAUSE THERE
ARE SOME JOBS THAT,
IRRESPECTIVE OF, YOU KNOW, HOW
HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO RECRUIT
CANADIANS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
HAVE THAT MANY CANADIANS
WORKING IN THE FIELDS. YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT MANY
PEOPLE WORKING IN THE
RESTAURANTS IN NORTHERN BC. AND
THERE ARE SOME SKILLS, EVEN IF
IT'S LOW SKILLED, THAT
EMPLOYERS ARE GOING TO NEED TO
HIRE. WORKERS WHO ARE WILLING
TO DO THAT. I THINK IN TERMS OF
THE HIGHER SKILLS, THERE ARE
THERE ARE AMENDMENTS TO THE
PROGRAM THAT SHOULD BE IN PLACE.
>> AND WHAT DO THOSE LOOK LIKE?
>> I THINK NUMBER ONE, LOOK AT
THE GLOBAL TALENT STREAM AND
LOOK AT WHAT WORKS IN THE
GLOBAL TALENT STREAM, THE
BENEFITS THAT THE EMPLOYERS ARE
GOING TO BRING TO THE ECONOMY.
LOOK, AND DON'T THROW AWAY THE
BABY WITH THE BATHWATER. YOU
KNOW, WE HAVE CERTAIN ELEMENTS
OF OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT
IS VITAL TO THE GROWTH OF OUR
ECONOMY. THAT'S VITAL TO OUR
EMPLOYERS, TO OUR COMPANIES.
RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO
HAVE INVESTED THEIR LIVES IN
CANADA, WHO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR
YEARS, WHO HAVE BEEN EDUCATED
HERE FOR YEARS, AND WE NEED
PEOPLE IN CANADA TO BE
TAXPAYERS FOR THE FUTURE. SO WE
HAVE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS WITH
OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. AND IF
WE DON'T WORK TO KEEP THEM,
THEN WE WILL SUFFER A GREAT
LOSS FOR THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF
OUR REPUTATION, IN TERMS OF OUR
BUSINESSES AND IN TERMS OF OUR
COMMUNITIES AS WELL.
>> ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO
LEAVE IT THERE. MICHAEL,
ELIZABETH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
REALLY APPRECIATE THE
CONVERSATION.
>> THANK YOU.
