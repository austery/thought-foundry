This is Bloomberg Businessweek Daily,
reporting from the magazine that helps
global leaders stay ahead with insight
on the people, companies and trends
shaping today's complex economy.
Plus, global business, finance and tech
news as it happens, Bloomberg
Businessweek Daily with Carol Massar and
Tim Stent event live on Bloomberg Radio,
Television, YouTube and Bloomberg
Originals.
And very good afternoon, everybody.
Yes, across Bloomberg platforms.
I'm Carol Massar here at bloomberg
headquarters in new york city.
He is not tim stan evac.
He is matthew miller who has been all
over the place today.
Yeah, a lot going on today.
Is this on?
This is on.
Okay.
This is on the like means there's so
much going on today.
The amazing gyrations that we had.
Right.
On Friday, we were down 2.7%.
Yesterday.
We were back up one and a half percent.
This morning.
We were back down 1% and now we're back
up.
It's just insane this trade and the
market clearly just wants to rally.
Well, and I think one of the things is
what's happening with the US-China trade
negotiations.
We've definitely seen that's what
happened on Friday.
Right.
We've seen that play out already on
Monday and Tuesday here.
It's also the big banks reporting Jp
morgan Goldman, Wells Fargo, Citi.
Not all the stocks reacted the same.
Investors like some.
They didn't like the others.
That's right.
Jp morgan and Goldman Sachs both down
even as the market turned higher.
So I was talking to SRI this morning.
We're going to talk to him in a little
bit.
Yeah.
And he said, look, the macro picture
really does affect these stocks.
But I talked to an analyst over at Baird
who said the problem with Jp morgan is
it's a great company, its stock is too
expensive and that's maybe why it's
trading down.
Even though it's down today, it's up 27%
year to date.
So there you have it, folks.
Hey, we're gonna talk about that.
We're going to get into US-China trade
talks ongoing.
Some start some stops.
We see that play out.
A fascinating story bar and a current
global trade flows moving on to avoid
the highest U.S.
tariffs since 1930.
Mat, the world is moving on it.
Well, I just wonder if the rare earths
risk isn't underappreciated here.
I mean, they seem to have us by the
short hairs there.
Yeah, because you talk about China.
Yeah, China because we, you know, don't
even mind them.
If we did mine them, we can't refine
them.
And I'm not sure we could get that off
the ground beyond military capability.
So they have its parts.
They have the cards.
Yeah, exactly.
All right.
Lots to come.
Also, Mat's big interview with Paul
Tudor Jones.
There's a lot coming.
You don't want to go anywhere for the
next 60 minutes.
First up, though, let's get a check on
the trade.
Your top business stories here is
Charlie.
Thank you very much.
Great to be back.
And we're looking at a lot of moving
parts to this market, including
earnings, including tariffs and
including Fed Chair Jay Powell.
A volatile session for the U.S.
stock market, as Matt alluded to, Fed
Chair Powell reinforcing speculation
that officials are on track to cut rates
in October amid a weakening labor
market.
You heard his remarks live on Bloomberg
Television and radio.
The S&P right now up 20.
We're close to session highs, up by
about 3/10 of 1%.
The Dow up 425 gain there of 9/10.
And we've got Nasdaq lower now by 2/10
of 1%.
The ten year at 4.02%.
Now with a two year, 3.47%, gold is up
$41.
The ounce of 41, 51 up 1%.
And West Texas Intermediate crude oil
down 1.1%, WTI 5883 a barrel and Bitcoin
down two and a half percent, 112,950.
Now on Bitcoin, traders are focused on
the unofficial start of the earnings
season.
Among the names reporting this morning,
Jp morgan Chase down now by 6/10 of 1%.
Citigroup surging 4.8%, Wells Fargo up
by 8.8%.
Goldman down now by 3/10 of 1%.
Tomorrow, we will be hearing from Bank
of America and Morgan Stanley for on
Demand news 24 hours a day.
Subscribe to Bloomberg News now wherever
you get your podcasts.
I'm Charlie Peloton.
That is a Bloomberg Business flash.
All right, Charlie, thank you so much.
As matt and I said a lot going on on
this Tuesday.
We do want to remind everybody we are
monitoring a live event that's happening
right now in the white house, in the
Oval Office.
President Trump is meeting with
Argentinian President Javier Melaye.
We're going to continue to follow that.
Of course, they've been having a
meeting, a luncheon, a bilateral
luncheon, if you will, and obviously
some significant developments between
these two nations.
Well, look, they're in the Cabinet room.
We're in the Cabinet room, unless
they've added a giant desk to the.
Oh, sorry.
Okay.
And Scott Bassett talking there because
he has pledged to do whatever is
necessary to help backstop the
Argentinean peso.
And
it helped for a couple of days, but it
isn't helping.
Again, they're just bleeding dollars and
they may not have much left at all.
So it'll be interesting.
I'm actually going to talk with Hans
Humes a little bit later on the 16th.
He knows this world stuff, so we
absolutely can get his take.
I'll report back to you.
Distressed emerging debt by all that
actually Argentina, man you are just on
fire.
All right.
We're going to talk about Matt's
interview with Paul Tudor Jones a little
bit later on because it was a great
listen.
I was in the car and I listened to all
of it.
In the meantime, as we watch and monitor
for any headlines out of the meeting in
the Cabinet Room.
We do want to talk about that volatile
session on Wall Street.
Matt and I talked about it at the
beginning.
We've kind of been bouncing around since
Friday, if you will.
And we did see stocks paring most of
their earlier losses amid hopes of U.S.
and China trade negotiations still being
on the table.
U.S.
trade Rep Jamison Greer telling CNBC
that President Trump will still set or
is still set to meet his Chinese
counterpart, President Xi Jinping.
Greer also saying that he thinks we'll
be able to work through it with China.
It'll be fine.
The president tweeted on Sunday that
it'll be fine.
Well, even so, the world is kind of
moving on and we're seeing the new
control towers of global commerce taking
off amid these global tariffs.
Let's see what undercurrent has to say
and what it means in terms of the global
macro environment.
Here's bloomberg news, global economy
reporter he joins us from our bloomberg
news washington, d.c.
bureau.
And a good to have you here.
First off, we do see these wall street
swings and what's coming out between the
u.s.
and china.
Why is this still just remind everybody,
why is this still the most important
global economic relationship in the
world or is it starting to kind of
change a little bit?
Well, they are the two world's biggest
economies and they are, of course,
completely interlocked with each other.
China is the world's biggest
manufacturer, but of course, America is
their biggest customer.
It's the biggest consumer market in the
world.
So obviously, the trade tensions between
them do spill over to everybody kind of
in the middle of that in terms of supply
chains.
And that's what we're kind of seeing
some reaction or some response out to
the rest of the world.
And even for starting point is like,
yes, we'll always have to do business
with America because of consumers so
powerful, their trading partners are
kicking tires.
And hang on a sec, who else kind of do
business with?
How else can you diversify my markets?
China's looking around, say, buying more
agricultural produce from South America,
as we know.
But also its exports are going
gangbusters through parts of the world
other than America.
And then those other countries in the
middle are saying, you know, who else
can we start doing more trade deals
with?
They're accelerating trade negotiations.
They're accelerating ways of doing
business with each other, looking for
new markets.
So it's very early stages.
But and that US-China trade war is
starting to poke some change in the
global trade.
You know, I mean, I think the question
is the question that JD Vance
probably doesn't have an answer to.
Can China
be cut off from U.S.
trade longer than we can stay solvent
because the rare earth minerals that
they have, we cannot get in size from
anywhere else and we're not going to be
able to process them here or to refine
them here any time soon.
So, you know, Meredith Whitney, in a
note on Sunday, said,
Aside from the massive dependence on the
U.S.
industrial complex complex for these
rare earth metals and magnets, the U.S.
military is 100% dependent on them and
nearly depleted of its reserves.
So,
I mean, don't we need them more than
they need us right now?
Yeah, I think we're all at a point now
where we are fully aware that if there
is a vulnerability in the hawkish trade
stance that the U.S.
is taking on China, it's on rare earth
supplies and China is the one digging
them out of the ground.
China is the one that's taking on the
refining risk, their environmental risk,
and the costs associated with it at a
scale that no other country is doing.
And that's why America and everybody
else is so reliant on China and getting
those minerals out here.
And that's why China, of course, it's
well aware of its leverage.
It's floated those export controls that
it did last week or the week before.
And of course, it sent shockwaves not
just through the U.S., but the rest of
the world, too.
And China is making clear that it's in
control of these.
Now, this is a policy error, though.
If you go back maybe 15 years ago, there
was a big there was a discussion around
rare earth supply.
At that time.
There were other options on the table.
It's not just China.
It has these minerals.
Other countries could have put money
into the ground and put the money into
the resources and the facilities needed
to extract these.
Or some companies in the U.S.
that are talking about are trying to get
off the ground at the moment in doing
this.
But the point is, we're at a stage where
China has a grip and a lock on the
system to the point where everybody else
is years behind.
It will take a long time.
Mean not just getting them out of the
ground.
And I mean, I talked to industrial CEOs
who do business globally and have told
me, look, we've seen the refining
process in China and it is horrific.
It is the kind of environmental risk
that American voters just would not be
willing to take.
So no one else can refine them at these
levels, at least with today's methods,
without sacrificing like a portion of
humanity.
So we're not going to do that, are we?
Well, and that's.
Right.
Environmental risk is a big part of the
equation now.
But there are some companies, by the
way, there are some, including some in
the US, who are looking for cleaner ways
to do this.
So but obviously nothing like on the
scale that China currently offers.
But other countries as well are coming
to table.
Pakistan, for example, is floating
itself as a potential partner for these
minerals for the US, and they can be
sourced from all other countries too.
That's why Argentina is in the mix at
the moment when when we talk about the
support that the US Treasury is offering
Argentina, one of the reasons is because
of the minerals the Argentina has.
So but but yes, the point is that no
one's doing it on the scale that China
is right now.
And until that changes, China has
leverage over the rest of the global
trading system.
I want to go into your story that looks
at global trade flows and you look at
what shipping shipping companies are
seeing and some of the changes.
But there's
a quote in the story.
An associate professor of economics at
the University of California at Davis in
a seminar of ISCA, and it said this
individual saying it's very clear that
we are redrawing the map of
international trade.
We're going to see a lot more bilateral
trade agreements between countries and
subgroups of countries.
She predicts this.
What does that mean for economic growth,
for individual countries and for the
global economy overall?
Do we know anything?
And is it good?
Is it bad?
Well, it's early stages, but we're
getting we're seeing signs now that
countries are looking at accelerating
trade negotiations with each other and
signing deals with each other.
And the European Union is one example.
They finally gotten that deal signed
with Indonesia.
They are getting that big trade
negotiation with South American Mercosur
off the ground, trying to get that
ratified.
Other countries are also looking at
doing business more with each other,
like New Zealand and Switzerland and the
UAE are among a group who have gotten
together.
And it's kind of a loose trading
agreement that they've pulled together
over recent months.
And the point of all of this is is, as I
said at the start.
It's nobody suggesting the US is not the
world's biggest consumer market and that
they don't want to do business here.
That's not the point.
But they're seeing the tariffs going up
at the fastest pace since World War Two.
It's more complicated, more costly for
some of the businesses who want to do
trade with us.
And they're asking what else can you do
to diversify and mix up their supply
lines under under their markets?
And we're seeing it in Peruvian fruit
farmers.
They're looking for new and alternative
markets in Lesotho.
They're looking for alternative textile
markets, maybe in Europe and then in
Asia.
So, you know, as I say, the terrible one
that's going up on the U.S.
side, it's not about countries not
wanting to do business here, but they
are certainly kicking tires on where
else they can diversify.
And that's what these these trade
negotiations are getting A shot in the
arm was wanted.
One of the professors, a quote in the
article said to us.
All right.
We're talking with and occurring global
economy reporter at bloomberg news in
our d.c.
bureau.
At the same time, we are monitoring the
white house, the cabinet room.
President trump is there with president
malay of argentina.
They are having a bilateral lunch and
obviously meeting.
We're monitoring any headlines that come
out of that meeting.
In the meantime, you know, and you talk
about in this story these bilateral
relationships, or at least folks that
you talk to are talking about a lot more
bilateral trade agreements.
Who wins?
Those are big countries, small
countries, middle sized countries.
Is there clear winners and losers on
that metric?
Well, probably the biggest countries
will be the ones who come out of this in
better order, because, you know, the
system up until now, whether one agrees
with it or not.
But the broad system up until a few
years ago had been rules of the road set
by the World Trade Organization.
This is where countries, big and small
could come together and have their
disagreements and argue out their case
for whatever their grievance was in the
trade world.
But, you know, we've moved past that
now.
We're kind of moving this bi lateral
sort of approach to doing trade deals.
So when you have a big country, they are
able to set the terms on the table.
And the smaller country, of course, has
to work around that.
And that's where we are.
It's not just it's not just the US, of
course, and China is the other big
player in the global trading system.
They, as we just spoke about, hold the
cards in so many areas.
Now when it comes to not just very
markets, but they're the world's, you
know, factory.
So they also will set terms and
countries are worried about China's
volume of exports and trying to compete
against China to give them the scale and
competitiveness in which they can
produce products versus other countries.
So the big picture is better for bigger
countries, tougher for first of all, the
countries are an undercurrent.
Thank you so much on today's news and
his story, global economy reporter at
bloomberg news.
You can read the entirety of it.
It's on the bloomberg and at
bloomberg.com
and to talking about important
relationships, u.s.
and china certainly.
But right now, what is top of mind for
president trump at the white house in
the cabinet room is a relationship with
argentina, argentina excuse me.
And he's there with president Lula.
Let's listen in.
All right.
You are listening to President Trump.
He's live there at the White House in
the Cabinet Room there, of course, with
Argentinian President Malay.
An array of topics coming up in terms of
the relationship between the two
countries.
The president
being asked if there was a free trade
agreement, possibly with Argentina.
He says it's possible.
He also Mat was asked about the U.S.
swap
that is underway between the two nations
involving currencies, the two currencies
of the two nations not predicated on
Argentina, ending the China swap, which
has been there to help up Argentine
reserves.
So a little bit more on that
relationship Sounds like still some
questions to come.
Yeah, he's right now he's talking about
his relationship with President Xi.
And I'll just point out that is what
shifts these markets.
So when he makes a statement that's very
negative and aggressive about President
Xi or China, then you get a sell off the
likes of which we saw on Friday, 2.7%,
182 points off the S&P.
When he makes a statement that's more
positive like he did on Sunday.
Yeah, China's going to be fine.
He just said again, I think the
relationship with China will be fine.
Then you have a market rally, then you
have investors coming in to buy the dip.
Today, we saw a turnaround, as you know,
because Jamieson Greer on CNBC said that
the two are still going to meet.
So if he says anything about President
Xi right now, that could turn the
market.
Yes.
I'll continue to monitor the headlines.
All right.
Sounds good.
And we do have most names in the S&P
500, over 400 higher today, folks.
Here's where the S&P is.
It's up 18 points.
So at its highs of this session, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, a gain of 392
points, up 8/10 of a percent.
NASDAQ 100 still under a little bit of
pressure, but it's had quite a run over
the last few months, down just about 20
points.
A call it pretty much unchanged on the
day.
One group that has done really well
today as a whole, we're talking about
big banks are banks overall.
The KBW Bank index folks up 2.3%.
22 of the 24 names are higher in today's
session.
We've had the big ones lower.
Two of the big ones are lower.
Two of the biggest names on the entire
index are lower right now.
What's interesting is Jp morgan,
Goldman, Wells, Citi, all reporting, Jp
morgan and Goldman selling off, right?
Yeah, those are the two names you're
talking about.
And Wells and Citi, Matt, are are well,
again, I mean, and you get headlines
like Jp morgan beats expectations on
every level.
Goldman Sachs knocks the cover off the
ball.
Analysts can't believe how well they
did.
And yet the stocks sell off.
But remember, something like Jp morgan
has had quite a run this year.
So, you know, expectations and reality
perhaps.
Let's see what our experts have to say.
Bloomberg News chief Wall Street
correspondent Sree Natarajan is here in
studio along with Bloomberg
Intelligence, senior analyst for global
investment banks and asset managers
Alison Williams.
As I said, both in studio.
All right, guys, let's start with Jp
morgan, because I feel like that's the
bank that we want to always hear from.
Alison, let me start with you.
What do we need to know about the
numbers in Jp morgan's business?
Because as Matt said, sometimes the
headlines look darn good and the quarter
was darn good.
It's just that I think there are some
bullish investors out there that wanted
more.
And if you did, you know so on today
they're underperforming.
But if you look at year to date, if you
look at their valuation, if you look at
their year returns, I'm sorry, you look
at their profitability are very, very
good executing well, I think that, you
know, maybe some people just wanted some
more there.
Goldman Sachs also strong quarter they
did miss on equities trading.
So, you know, these numbers are hard to
predict.
But I think, you know, most people,
including myself, but, you know, if you
had seen sort of that, that upside would
give you sort of further confidence in
the momentum going into the next
quarter.
But the M&A advisory business, huge
outperformance there, we think they
probably outperformed most on the
quarter.
They're the lead in that revenue.
They announced this a I program there
details.
You know, I'm going to have to wait till
January for details, but that signals
that efficiency is going to get better.
You know, contrast that, you know, two
companies that are really performing
very well to two companies that are, I
think, have a lot of runway ahead of
them, and that's Wells Fargo and
Citigroup.
Can I just ask before we get to story,
because I've already asked him like ten
times today, why do the analysts
consistently underestimate what these
banks are doing?
And it can't just be to get on the good
side of management.
Right?
When I see this morning before any
earnings came out, I saw stories about
which bank was going to beat estimates.
So when I see bank expected to top
estimates, I wonder why analysts don't
add more to the estimates.
What's why?
What is this game all about?
Well, first of all, trading and when
it's capital markets revenue, that
really is the source of the upside.
That is very tough.
And banks are not going to guide you.
Right.
You know, they don't really have an
incentive to shake your hand as, by the
way, the last couple of days of the
quarter could be horrible or you don't
know what's going to happen.
And so I think banks are going to tend
to guide conservatively.
Analysts are going to tend to be
conservative.
Right.
Because that
and by the way, like that just is not
something that people bake into the run
rate.
So as I said, you know, we're positive
about the.
Momentum in trading.
Yeah, the asset levels, etc.
But I think if you're, you know, forming
estimates, you are going to tend to be
conservative and that's why you can get
upside, especially if the strength comes
at the end of the quarter.
It's just hard for the instruments to
catch up.
Yeah, totally get it.
All right.
So we care about JPMorgan's results.
We also obsess over everything that
Jamie Dimon has to say.
He never disappoints is something that
is highly quotable in this case.
It was when he was talking about a
cockroach.
Check it out.
And you should assume that ever
something happens.
Reed scour all process, all procedures,
all underwriting all everything.
And, you know, we think we're okay and
all this stuff.
But I my my intent goes up and things
like that happen.
I probably shouldn't say this, but when
you see one cockroach, you're probably
more, you know, And so we should
everyone should be forewarned in this
one.
All right.
That, of course, was Jamie Dimon earlier
today on JPMorgan's early earnings call.
Come on in on this because you're
reporting on the quarter.
And, you know, most importantly, what
Jamie Dimon has to say about the macro.
So, again, Jamie Dimon has been running
the biggest U.S.
bank, which is which has a bigger market
cap today than its three closest rivals
combined.
He's been doing that for nearly 20 years
and he didn't get there.
And you didn't stay there
just in the back of sitting on his
laurels.
Right.
He's paid to look around the corners and
he is right to point out that the
underlying numbers might be great.
They might be marching toward another
record revenue here.
But when you see some of these problems,
you initially try and dismiss some of
them as idiosyncratic.
But if enough of them start popping up,
that becomes a concern.
So that's why when Diamond says my
antenna goes up, when things like that
happen, we pay attention, Especially
because in the last few days we've been
seeing some action in certain corners of
the credit market where it does appear
that there is some fear seeping into the
markets.
And Dimon specifically flicked at the
publicly traded BDCs that hold a lot of
these private credit investments.
And if you look at the discount, the net
asset value that they're going at it, it
makes you worry about what's happening
with some of the other non-traded
vehicles.
Will there be mass redemptions and will
there be domino effects off of that?
And Dimon also points out that he feels
like they're feeling very good about
everything, that if you look at their
numbers, you will not see any cause for
stress, dismay, concern.
But Diamond is right in saying
eventually the cycle turns.
And when it does, he thinks that I
suspect when there's a downturn, his
words you will see higher than normal
downturn type of credit losses in
certain categories.
And that's an important one to keep in
mind, because what he's saying is the
recovery rates might not be as great as
he imagined and that will impact the
firms and that will impact the investors
in those firms.
I want to ask about Wells Fargo.
I'm so thankful that Bloomberg Radio has
such a great program in the mornings.
Nathan Hager and Karen Moskow, we're
talking to you, Alison, before I even
got to work yet, and I get here pretty
early and you were saying this is really
going to be the news of the day and it
has been the outperformer of the day
because can I just say finally.
Well, because long in coming.
So what's the story with Wells Fargo?
They raised their return on tangible
equity.
So so the key metric for banks return on
tangible common equity valuations, you
know, price to book is is how a lot of
investors value these banks.
It's based on that return on capital.
And, you know, Charlie Scharf said years
ago, we're going to put 15% out there as
a as a target.
We'll revisit it at some point.
They're running at 15% year to date.
They upped that target to 17 to 18%.
The asset cap is lifted.
They showed a lot of progress that
they've made, but they also showed some
opportunity.
And here's what I think is interesting.
So one of the biggest areas of
opportunity is the consumer unit.
When we had
Laurie Beer from Jp morgan, the CEO of
Jp morgan, talk about where she sees big
opportunity.
She actually talked about this at Jp
morgan's Investor Day, also the consumer
unit also like a lot of the a lot of
what she talked about in terms of how
technology was going to aid the bank was
in that it was productivity in the
consumer unit.
So we're hearing that from Wells Fargo.
So that really gives me confidence that
this is a number that they can chew to
Citigroup, by the way, I think, you
know, they're also kind of showing the
path, right?
So Citigroup talking about the fact that
they are sort of two thirds the way
there with their transformation.
And we have Banamex coming.
You know, it's pushed out a little bit.
But I think showing you the path that,
you know, could that be Citigroup again,
talk about an even longer time.
But could could could Jane Frazier
finally be the one to get it done?
And I will point out, like with Wells
Fargo now up, what, 8.2% for the day,
it's their best day since since election
night, since Trump came back to power.
This could be Wells Fargo's best day
since then.
So that is the power of putting a target
out there.
And I point that out again only because
in a couple of weeks you will have Bank
of America with their Investor Day,
their first Investor Day in 15 years.
It has also been the worst performing
big bank's stock this year, up only,
what, 14%?
14 and change.
It is important for Bank of America to
approach that Investor Day with a
mindset of providing targets,
aspirational targets for the market
instead of wanting to go out there were
trying to explain to investors and
analysts what it is that they do,
because I think investors will tell you
they have a good understanding.
What they want is better targets and
what they want is them achieving those
targets.
Otherwise the stock will continue to
languish.
All right.
I do want to mention a headline
crossing.
We are continuing to monitor President
Trump there at the White House.
He is talking also about Russia and
President Putin saying President Putin
does not want to end the war.
And then going on to say that the
Russian economy is going to collapse.
So that is certainly another one of the
big geopolitical events and actions that
we've been keeping and something that
the president has been trying to bring
an end to and talked about that on the
campaign trail.
But again, President Putin doesn't want
to end the war.
That is the view from President Trump at
the White House.
I know you had one last question.
You wanted to.
Yeah, I want to ask Alison about the
best way to value these companies.
I was talking with Sheree about this on
Bloomberg TV earlier, and David George
from Baird also was saying like, look,
Jp morgan can be a fantastic company and
it is, but the stock is just too
expensive, which is why he doesn't have
a buy rating on those shares.
And then Sree and I were looking through
the price to book What is the best way?
How do the best bank investors
look at valuations that that makes the
most sense for banks?
Because I think it's a little different
than other equities.
It is different because so if you think
about banks versus other kind of
companies, they use their balance sheet
to generate profits.
And so that's why return on tangible
common equity is a key metric, right?
Because the more profitability that you
can generate using your balance sheet,
the more you're willing to pay.
So that's a little bit different than
pay.
You will notice that price to book is
really favored in downturns.
It's a place where people look for, you
know, in terms of, you know, one times
price, Your book is sort of if you if
you liquidate the bank, what can I get
for this versus the ongoing returns?
And that's why you have companies like
Citigroup trading below tangible book or
below book, which obviously they've made
a lot of progress since then.
But for a long time,
you know, your bank was trading at like
20% book very well And the European
banks.
Right because they're they're not
earning their cost of capital.
So basically you're eroding value over
time.
So that's sort of the opposite.
And so I think, you know, those are kind
of like two different ways to think
about it.
By the way, JPMorgan management also
talking about their not liking to buy
shares back at this level.
I heard that, you know, they're pretty
daring that they're willing to call that
out.
But from an equity investor standpoint,
that's not really helpful either.
Hey, 22nd Street, what do we have?
B of A and Morgan Stanley.
DeMar, just quickly, what what you're
watching out for will be a very long
sunny tomorrow.
Again we have our analyst expectations
set out there so we're hoping they'll go
and beat them.
But which brings us back full circle.
Matt's original point like I don't know
what he wants enlisted or should they
apply a humility premium to win
executives guidelines.
So if I were if I were estimating
someone's earnings, I would try and get
it right.
And if I got it, if I was lowballing it
for the last nine out of ten quarters, I
would just add 20% doing it based off
how the executives are guiding you.
What do you want to check?
Prime Hey, kids, take this outside.
Okay.
All right.
We're going to continue this
conversation.
We will here at Bloomberg as we continue
the bank earnings throughout the rest of
this week.
Right now, let's get a check on the
trading session.
Here is Charlie Bell.
It very much Bank of America, which does
report tomorrow of 2.8%.
Morgan Stanley also tomorrow.
Up now by just about 7/10 of 1%, U.S.
stocks were trading mixed.
We have got the Dow, the S&P, they're
both higher, Nasdaq in the red, S&P up
16, up by about 2/10 of 1%.
The Dow now up 8/10 of 1% after earlier
losses.
Nasdaq, though, in the red, NASDAQ
composite index down 48 drop there of
2/10 of 1%.
Your ten year, 4.02% with a two year,
3.47% spot.
Gold up 1%, 4149 the ounce.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil down
1.1%, 5883 a barrel on WTI and Bitcoin
now at 113,085, trading lower by 2.4%.
So again, recapping here, S&P 500 index
holding on to a gain of 3/10 of 1%.
I'm charlie palatine.
That is a bloomberg business flat.
All right, Charlie, thank you so much.
Well, Wall Street has spent years
preparing for 105 trillion, a pass from
elderly parents to their kids.
But a different kind of wealth transfer
is already underway.
We talked about this a little bit
yesterday, Matt.
More than a dozen women in the world's
500 richest people have become
billionaires after the death of a
spouse.
So watch it, guys.
No, I'm just kidding.
It's the highest number.
It makes sense because men naturally die
at an earlier age than women.
So anything sketchy there.
If you marry a woman who is your age,
which I guess is not so normal among the
ultra wealthy, you're likely to die
before her.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just logical.
And people have reported on this, so
it's nothing crazy like, you know, a bad
murder series or something.
Did you see what Stephen Colbert said?
What did he say?
He said, as his wife dies, he's going
like within a month because he can't
imagine life without her.
I think that's yeah, that's probably
also something that happens when we do
the same thing.
But let's talk about it because there is
this incredible wealth transfer and also
wealth concentration when it comes to
women.
So let's get into it.
In this week's Women Money and Power,
exploring how this shift is creating
huge implications for how vast sums of
money are invested, philanthropy and the
way that wealth is passed on to the next
generation.
Back with us is Jamie Maguire.
She is head of U.S.
Wealth Advisory and head of retirement
at BlackRock.
It's the world's largest asset manager.
They notched a record 13 and a half
trillion in assets.
It's up from a million when we last
talked in June and we got the figure
when BlackRock reported.
I don't know that I said your name
correctly.
Maghera.
Maghera.
Maghera.
It was great.
It's just like.
Maghera.
Just like it.
Well, I really like Jamie, so I want to
get it right.
Great to talk with you.
How are you?
Great.
It's really good to be back with you.
Well, you know, we are talking about the
environment generally, so let's start
there.
I know we did that over the summer when
we talk because BlackRock just see so
much in terms of the funds that overseas
and the flows and the flows continue to
grow.
But that doesn't mean the flows are
always going in the same places.
What can you give us insight in terms of
where money is going and where money's
going out of?
Yeah.
So first of all, excellent to be here.
And you started by talking about flows.
I'm going to take a gender perspective
on flows.
Yeah.
And talk to you a little bit about where
we see money going globally with women.
And so women more and more are earning
welfare, acquiring wealth, they're
owning wealth.
They're playing a larger role in capital
markets.
They are investing and benefiting from
these capital markets.
And we think there's no better sign of
hope in the future than having people
invest and grow along the capital
markets.
Is it because they're earning it
themselves and they're having some say,
or is it also in terms of couples
because they are often breadwinners as
well, that they also have a say at the
table?
Yes.
So it's both right.
So when you think about women, women are
more often now becoming breadwinners,
primary breadwinners.
Quite often they're also contributing to
household along with their spouses.
They're earning more money, but they're
also acquiring.
And you mentioned the wealth transfer.
You know, we think about that in two
ways.
There's the intergenerational wealth
transfer where they're gaining assets
maybe from their parents as they pass
away.
But the more interesting one is this
horizontal transfer.
Right.
So if a spouse passes away or if if
there is a divorce, women are acquiring
assets in that way and they need
financial advisors to help their
reshaping the industry.
And women have just not been served in
the way they need to be served.
And I mean, think about that, right,
with Melinda Gates.
You think about it with, you know, Jeff
Bezos died in the gates.
No, but I'm just saying there was a big
divorce.
I got you.
Yeah.
Okay.
You had significant players, certainly
in wealth overall, but also in
philanthropy.
Yes.
Yes.
Actually, so early estimates that
globally $124 trillion will change hands
in this silver tsunami.
And then
that and then their current forecasts
are that 54 trillion will be passed to
spouses first before it goes down
another generation.
So 40% of those spousal transfers will
be to women.
So this is what Sallie Krawcheck calls
the feminization of wealth.
And the idea is that when are the
important idea, I think here for for
you, for your industry, is that when
women get hold of this money, they often
don't stick with their same wealth
managers.
They often say, you know what, I'm going
to go with someone else now.
So what do you do if you want to get
hold of a piece of that pie?
Yeah.
So maybe I might even just
dimensionalize what you mentioned
because I think about it in percentages.
So today, let's call it women
responsible.
In controlling 30% of the world's
wealth, that will be 50% by 2030, that
will be 70% by 2070.
So these are big numbers.
Amazing.
Big numbers.
Yeah.
And women, as you say, they do things
differently.
Right?
And they want to do things differently.
And oftentimes when they're getting a
hold of this wealth, right, when wealth
is passing to them, either through their
parents and family or through their
spouses, they want to do it differently.
They want to be served differently.
70% of women leave their husbands
financial advisor after a divorce or a
death within one year.
Wow.
70%.
Why is that?
Because they oftentimes felt not heard.
Not part of the conversation, not at the
table and making decisions.
You know, there is a lot of
misconceptions around women.
Right.
People think women aren't engaged with
finance.
It's just not true.
A third of U.S.
households have women as the primary
financial decision maker.
People think women are or call women
perhaps a bit risk averse.
Well, that's what I wanted to ask you.
Are women risk averse?
Like, give me an idea when you're
talking about investments.
I mean, we've been thinking about the
air trade or private assets.
Are they risk averse?
So we did a study to make
generalizations, but I'm curious if
there are.
So.
Okay, So not a monolith, right?
Women are very different.
All my friends are different than me.
We all do different things and need
different things.
But generally speaking, we did a study
with 2500 female investors when we
talked to them about their risk
tolerance.
The majority of them were actually
moderate to aggressive because they saw
the power of not just gaining wealth
through working or through transition,
but actually gaining wealth through the
capital markets.
Right.
Investing in items that will end
securities and portfolios that will
actually help them grow their portfolio.
Private markets is a great example
again, for a financial advisor to play
that role and help a and coach and guide
a woman and how she thinks about her
portfolio across public and private.
Last time we were together, we talked
about direct indexing and the role of
taxes or, you know, women oftentimes
want to hear your life gets me excited.
Direct indexing.
Yeah.
You know what?
I anchored the ETF show for a long time,
and that's a big part of that discussion
as well.
You know what?
It's not just women.
Obviously, kids are going to
get hold of a lot of this money.
And I think I'm not sure about women,
but I know with younger people they want
to do more impact investing than their
parents did or their grandparents did.
So is that also a key to try?
Because I'm thinking from the
perspective of a wealth manager who
wants more business.
So what I need to do is say, hey, I can
I can set up some direct indexing for
you and I can help you make an impact
with the money you invest.
It's not just to make more money.
You're also going to change.
Some part of the world that you want to
is not the case.
It is.
And I like to use the word purpose,
because actually impact has many
different meanings.
And so if I'm a financial advisor and
I'm working with a younger client or a
woman, I'm going to be talking to and by
the way, men too, right?
It's not just about the impact you're
having.
You could invest in a way that maybe
aligns with your values or maybe have
certain values that are important to you
to hold in that portfolio.
I love motorcycles, so I wouldn't want
to be holding their, you know, Ducati
story go.
But, you know, I often wonder about that
because, you know, if you care about the
environment, but if it if an investment
doesn't pay, do people are people doing
that because they believe in it, but it
may not return as much as something
else?
I'm going to give you an answer that
will be terribly unfulfilling.
It depends.
Okay.
So there are people and by the way,
let's step away from the portfolio for a
moment and say, what about philanthropy?
This is where I come back to purpose,
right?
People are looking to put their money to
good cause, and that might be
philanthropic.
It might be impact in their portfolio.
It might be aligning with the values I
have.
It might also be sending my children to
school or helping my elderly parents or
starting a new business.
Right.
How about not for purpose or shielding
your money from taxes?
Right.
I mean, I guess I'd be willing to take
somewhat of a loss
by putting my money into a philanthropic
vehicle, especially if it's compared to
a much bigger loss by giving it away to
Uncle Sam and state and local and
federal taxes.
And again, that's where I look at things
in a vacuum.
You have to look at them, Right?
Overall, holistic wealth planning.
And again, the role of a financial
advisor is critical there.
Got to ask you, just in general, when
you look at this environment and we talk
a lot about a bubble right now, I don't
know what is what is your take on it?
What are you or what are the
conversations you're having with clients
about how they feel about are they a
little nervous about that trade?
Yeah, we talk about I mean, we talk to
clients, advisors and clients to
institutions globally all the time.
Look, the markets are the markets and
there are long term investors that need
to just keep staying with the markets we
talk about.
It's not time in the market or timing
the markets, it's time in the markets.
The other thing, though, is you just
have to acknowledge that there's
uncertainty out there, right?
There is volatility.
There are things going on in the markets
that again, everyday people let's take
it to America and Americans.
Everyday people need professional
advice.
They need someone they can trust that
will help them navigate that through
professionally managed solutions or
through advice.
But there is uncertainty out there.
But again, we come back to it's time in
the market, not timing the market.
20 seconds, Jamie.
I mean, more people feeling comfortable
putting money to work.
Are they after kind of a nice bounce
from the April lows or they're like, I'm
good, I'm done.
I want to be a bit more conservative.
Just quickly.
No, we are seeing we are seeing flows
into portfolios in ways that are across.
As I said, BlackRock was up
$1,000,000,000,000 since the summer.
We talk.
We are having the best conversations we
have ever been having with finance.
Advisors, institutions and wealth
managers across the world.
People are very interested.
Interested.
Okay, good.
Jamie, thank you so much.
So glad we got some time.
Jamie McGarry, she's head of U.S.
Wealth Advisory, head of Retirement over
at BlackRock, joining us here in studio.
Matthew, where are you going?
I have to go to TV.
Oh, okay.
Boy, this is a crazy world.
He was on TV, but he's going to go again
to TV.
If you are watching on TV, the close is
coming your way.
