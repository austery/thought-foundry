From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Friday,
 October
 24th.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


At
 the
 White
 House
 yesterday,
 two


developments
 showed
 the
 sway
 that
 the


tech
 and
 crypto
 industries
 hold
 with


President
 Trump,
 and
 how
 some
 of the


most
 influential
 figures
 from
 those


worlds
 have
 the
 president's
 ear.
 Maybe


you
 heard
 we
 were
 going
 to
 do
 a
 big


surge
 in
 San
 Francisco,
 but
 I
 call
 got
 a


great
 call
 from
 some
 incredible
 people,


some
 friends
 of
 mine,
 very
 successful


people.


>> Trump
 announced
 he
 was
 calling
 off
 a


planned
 deployment
 of
 federal


immigration
 agents
 to
 San
 Francisco,


which
 was
 supposed
 to
 start
 tomorrow.
 He


said
 he'd
 halted
 it
 at
 the
 request
 of


friends
 of
 his
 who
 live
 and
 work
 there.


and
 he
 specifically
 named
 the
 head
 of


Salesforce,
 Mark
 Beni
 off,
 and
 the
 chief


executive
 of
 the
 chip
 giant
 Nvidia,


Jensen
 Wong.


>> And
 they
 said,
 "We're
 working
 really,


really
 hard
 with
 the
 mayor.
 We're
 making


progress.
 Would
 it
 be
 possible
 for
 you


hold
 off
 for
 you
 to
 hold
 off
 the
 surge?"


And


>> Trump
 also
 had
 a
 call
 with
 San


Francisco's
 mayor.
 The
 mayor
 said
 they


talked
 about
 the
 recent
 drop
 in
 crime
 in


the
 city
 and
 how
 the
 AI
 industry
 is


booming
 there.
 Trump
 then
 posted
 on


social
 media
 that
 he'd
 been
 convinced
 to


give
 the
 city
 a
 chance,
 even
 as
 he
 said


federal
 intervention
 is
 needed
 in
 other


Democratic
 le
 cities
 to
 root
 out


undocumented
 immigrants
 and
 address


crime.


And
 yesterday,
 President
 Trump
 pardoned


the
 billionaire
 founder
 of
 the


cryptocurrency
 exchange
 Binance,
 wiping


away
 one
 of
 the
 federal
 government's


most
 significant
 convictions
 in
 crypto


crime.
 Changpen
 Xiao,
 who
 goes
 by
 CZ,


pleaded
 guilty
 in
 2023
 to
 money


laundering
 violations
 that
 allowed


terrorists
 and
 criminals
 to
 move
 money


on
 his
 platform.
 He
 served
 4
 months
 in


prison.
 Long
 considered
 the
 richest
 man


in
 crypto.
 CZ
 then
 hired
 lawyers
 and


lobbyists
 with
 ties
 to
 the
 Trump


administration
 to
 seek
 a
 pardon.


>> Can
 you
 explain
 why
 you
 chose
 to
 pardon


him
 and
 did
 it
 have
 anything
 to
 do
 with


his
 involvement
 in
 your
 own
 family's


crypto
 business?
 The
 president
 faced


questions
 from
 reporters
 about
 the


pardon
 decision,
 including
 if
 it
 was


related
 to
 the
 deal
 Binance
 recently


struck
 with
 the
 Trump
 family's
 crypto


startup.
 The
 president
 did
 not
 directly


answer
 the
 question.


>> Support.
 He
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 support
 and


they
 said
 that
 what
 he
 did
 is
 not
 even
 a


crime.
 It
 wasn't
 a
 crime
 that
 he
 was


persecuted
 by
 the
 Biden
 administration.


Uh
 and
 so
 I
 gave
 him
 a
 pardon
 at
 the


request
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 very
 good
 people.


After
 the
 pardon
 was
 announced,
 another


crypto
 executive
 who
 Trump
 pardoned


earlier
 this
 year
 congratulated
 CZ
 on


social
 media,
 writing,
 quote,
 "Welcome


to
 the
 club."


In
 other
 news
 from
 the
 White
 House,
 late


last
 night,
 President
 Trump
 announced


that
 he's
 cutting
 off
 all
 trade


negotiations
 with
 Canada,
 which
 has
 been


trying
 to
 get
 the
 US
 to
 reverse
 some
 of


the
 double-digit
 tariffs
 Trump
 slapped


on
 its
 major
 exports.
 The
 reason
 Trump


gave
 for
 his
 sudden
 decision,
 a
 video
 ad


paid
 for
 by
 the
 province
 of
 Ontario.


>> When
 someone
 says,
 "Let's
 impose
 tariffs


on
 foreign
 imports,"
 it
 looks
 like


they're
 doing
 the
 patriotic
 thing
 by


protecting
 American
 products
 and
 jobs.


>> The
 ad
 uses
 parts
 of
 a
 speech
 made
 by


President
 Reagan
 in
 the
 late
 80s
 where


he
 called
 for
 free
 trade
 and
 warned


about
 what
 he
 saw
 as
 the
 dangers
 of


tariffs.
 Markets
 shrink
 and
 collapse.


Businesses
 and
 industries
 shut
 down.
 And


millions
 of
 people
 lose
 their
 jobs.


>> A
 lot
 of
 businesses
 in
 Ontario
 have
 been


shaken
 by
 Trump's
 trade
 policies.
 And


the
 province
 spent
 over
 $50
 million


getting
 the
 ad
 played
 on
 American
 TV
 to


try
 and
 make
 the
 case
 against
 tariffs.


Yesterday
 though,
 the
 Reagan


Presidential
 Foundation
 put
 out
 a


statement
 saying
 the
 ad
 misrepresented


Reagan's
 speech
 by
 using
 selective
 sound


bites.
 And
 hours
 later,
 in
 a
 post


cancelling
 the
 negotiations,
 Trump


called
 the
 video
 fake,
 though
 there's
 no


indication
 of
 that.
 The
 abrupt
 end
 to


the
 talks
 adds
 a
 new
 level
 of


uncertainty
 to
 the
 relationship
 between


the
 US
 and
 its
 second
 biggest
 trading


partner.


In
 the
 Senate
 yesterday,
 with
 no
 end
 in


sight
 to
 the
 government
 shutdown,
 both


Republicans
 and
 Democrats
 made
 their
 own


separate
 attempts
 to
 try
 and
 get


government
 workers
 paid.
 Those
 efforts


went
 nowhere.


>> They're
 protecting
 our
 nation.
 They're


protecting
 our
 safety
 and
 security.


They're
 they're
 writing
 social
 security


checks.


>> For
 their
 part,
 Senate
 Republicans
 tried


to
 pass
 a
 measure
 that
 would
 pay
 workers


who
 have
 been
 deemed
 essential,
 like
 law


enforcement
 and
 air
 traffic
 controllers


who've
 been
 required
 to
 keep
 working.


Democrats
 in
 the
 chamber
 blocked
 that


bill.


>> Our
 ask
 today
 is
 simple.
 Pay
 them
 for


the
 jobs
 that
 they
 were
 hired
 to
 do.


>> They
 argued
 that
 all
 federal
 workers


need
 to
 get
 paid.
 The
 essential


employees
 and
 the
 roughly
 700,000
 others


who've
 been
 furoughed.
 The
 Democrats


said
 they
 were
 worried
 that
 otherwise


the
 Trump
 administration
 could


essentially
 pick
 favorites
 and
 deem


essential
 whichever
 employees
 it
 wants


while
 leaving
 others
 whose
 work
 they


feel
 doesn't
 align
 with
 Republican


priorities
 unpaid.
 Republicans
 blocked


the
 attempt
 to
 pay
 everyone,
 saying
 if


Democrats
 want
 that,
 they
 should
 simply


vote
 to
 reopen
 the
 government.
 Democrats


have
 so
 far
 refused.
 They're
 holding
 out


for
 an
 extension
 of
 healthc
 care


subsidies.
 The
 shutdown
 is
 now
 in
 its


24th
 day.
 It's
 the
 second
 longest


shutdown
 in
 American
 history.


And
 finally,


>> today
 we
 are
 here
 in
 New
 York
 to


announce
 a
 historic
 arrest
 across
 a
 wide


sweeping
 criminal
 enterprise
 that


envelops
 both
 the
 NBA
 and
 Lacass
 Nostra.


In
 a
 scandal
 that
 is
 rocking
 the
 NBA,


the
 FBI
 announced
 that
 more
 than
 30


people
 have
 been
 arrested,
 including


current
 and
 former
 players,
 for


allegedly
 taking
 part
 in
 a
 pair
 of


gambling
 schemes.


>> This
 is
 an
 illegal
 gambling
 operation


and
 sports
 rigging
 operation
 that
 span


the
 course
 of
 years.


>> At
 a
 press
 conference
 yesterday,
 FBI


Director
 Cash
 Patel
 laid
 out
 the
 two


alleged
 criminal
 plots
 and
 some
 of
 the


tangled
 ties
 between
 them.
 First,
 the


sports
 betting.
 The
 FBI
 said
 at
 least


one
 current
 player
 and
 one
 former
 coach


shared
 private
 information
 about


injuries
 and
 starting
 lineups
 to
 set
 up


bets.
 Think
 of
 it
 as
 insider
 trading
 for


sports.
 Another
 accusation
 goes
 even


further,
 claiming
 Terry
 Rosier,
 who


currently
 plays
 for
 the
 Miami
 Heat,


purposely
 left
 a
 game
 early,
 saying
 his


foot
 hurt.
 He
 told
 a
 friend
 he
 was
 going


to
 do
 that
 ahead
 of
 time.
 and
 bettors


acting
 on
 that
 information
 placed


hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 dollars
 in
 bets


that
 his
 stats
 that
 game
 would
 be
 low.


They
 cashed
 in
 and
 then
 allegedly
 gave


Rosier
 some
 of
 the
 money.


>> One
 reason
 this
 is
 such
 an
 interesting


story
 is
 because
 it
 puts
 the
 microscope


on
 an
 industry
 that
 has
 grown
 very


quickly.
 My
 colleague
 Jenny
 Ventus
 has


been
 covering
 how
 in
 the
 last
 few
 years,


sports
 betting
 has
 become
 a


multi-billion
 dollar
 industry
 despite


concerns
 that
 it
 could
 lead
 to
 cases


like
 this,
 which
 threatened
 to
 undercut


the
 whole
 point
 of
 sports,
 that
 no
 one


knows
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 a
 game.


I
 think
 we
 are
 crossing
 over
 into
 this


realm
 where
 it's
 possible
 that
 games


have
 been
 manipulated.
 I
 think
 it
 raises


a
 lot
 of
 concerns
 and
 questions
 and
 this


is
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 were
 afraid
 of


when
 we
 opened
 the
 door
 to
 widespread


sports
 betting
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 How


would
 it
 change
 the
 game?
 How
 would
 it


impact
 our
 trust
 in
 the
 game?
 Now,
 the


second
 scheme
 allegedly
 took
 place
 off


the
 court
 in
 private
 invite
 only
 poker


games
 run
 by
 the
 mafia.
 The
 indictment


says
 that
 more
 than
 two
 dozen
 people,


including
 Chanty
 Bilips,
 the
 current


head
 coach
 of
 the
 Portland
 Trailblazers,


were
 involved
 in
 rigged
 games.
 It
 claims


Bilips
 and
 other
 sports
 celebrities,


were
 used
 to
 lure
 high
 rollers
 to
 play.


They
 were
 then
 cheated
 using
 a
 whole


slew
 of
 techniques.
 There
 were
 rigged


shuffling
 machines,
 secret
 cameras,
 an


X-ray
 poker
 table,
 and
 even
 special


contact
 lenses
 that
 were
 used
 to
 see


hidden
 markings
 on
 the
 back
 of
 the


cards.
 According
 to
 officials,
 one


victim
 lost
 almost
 $2
 million.
 And


players
 who
 weren't
 able
 to
 pay
 their


debts
 were
 threatened
 by
 the
 mob.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 If
 you'd

 these

Now,
 time
 for
 the
 quiz.
 Every
 week,
 we


ask
 you
 a
 few
 questions
 about
 what
 the


Times
 has
 been
 covering.
 Can
 you
 answer


them
 all?
 First
 up,


got
 a
 new
 challenge
 for
 you
 here.
 See
 if


you
 can
 name
 these
 three
 big
 stories


from
 this
 week
 with
 only
 sound
 effects


as
 your
 clues.
 I'll
 give
 you
 an
 example.


If
 one
 of
 the
 stories
 was
 egg
 prices


going
 up,
 we
 play
 this.


Ready


to
 give
 it
 a
 shot?
 Start
 with
 an
 easy


one.


The
 answer,


that's
 the
 heist
 at
 the
 Louv.


Investigators
 are
 still
 searching
 for


the
 power
 tool
 wielding
 thieves
 who
 sped


off
 on
 motor
 scooters
 with
 the
 priceless


jewels.


Next
 one,
 a
 hint,
 this
 one
 happened
 back


in
 the
 US.


that
 story.
 President
 Trump
 has
 ordered


the
 demolition
 of
 the
 entire
 east
 wing


of
 the
 White
 House
 to
 clear
 the
 way
 for


his
 90,000
 ft
 ballroom.


And
 third
 one
 for
 you1.


That
 was
 the
 outage
 of
 Amazon
 Web


Services
 earlier
 this
 week
 that
 briefly


took
 down
 hundreds
 of
 sites
 and
 apps,


causing
 chaos
 for
 a
 whole
 range
 of


companies
 from
 Netflix
 to
 Slack
 to


McDonald's.


Okay,
 moving
 on.
 This
 week,
 one
 of
 the


world's
 big
 economic
 powers
 picked
 a


woman
 as
 its
 leader
 for
 the
 first
 time


in
 the
 country's
 history.
 She's
 a


protege
 of
 the
 country's
 longest
 serving


prime
 minister
 who
 was
 assassinated
 a


few
 years
 ago.
 Which
 country
 is
 it?


I'll
 give
 you
 a
 hint.
 The
 countries
 in


Asia.


The
 answer


Takayichi
 was
 elected
 prime
 minister
 of


Japan.
 She's
 known
 for
 wearing
 blue


suits
 in
 honor
 of
 her
 political
 hero


Margaret
 Thatcher,
 the
 conservative
 icon


who
 was
 the
 UK's
 first
 female
 prime


minister.
 One
 of
 Takayichi's
 other


idols,


the
 heavy
 metal
 band
 Iron
 Maiden.
 She's


actually
 an
 amateur
 heavy
 metal
 drummer


herself,
 who
 reportedly
 told
 a
 Japanese


podcast
 that
 she
 sometimes
 stays
 up
 late


playing
 drums
 to
 let
 off
 steam.


And
 final
 question.


>> The
 World
 Series
 starts
 tonight
 with
 the


Los
 Angeles
 Dodgers
 facing
 off
 against


the
 Toronto
 Blue
 Jays.
 One
 team
 that


almost
 made
 it
 to
 the
 series.


>> Mariners
 have
 led
 for
 most
 of
 the
 ball


game
 and
 that's
 been
 wiped
 away
 with
 one


swing.


>> The
 Seattle
 Mariners.
 They
 tried


absolutely
 everything
 they
 could
 and


there's
 always
 been
 a
 ton
 of


superstition
 in
 sports,
 but
 some
 players


and
 fans
 took
 it
 to
 a
 whole
 other
 level


this
 year.
 Which
 of
 these
 things
 did
 the


Mariners
 and
 their
 base
 not
 try
 for
 good


luck?


Hiring
 a
 witch
 on
 Etsy
 to
 cast
 a
 spell?


Keeping
 a
 jumbo
 candle
 from
 Costco


burning
 for
 months?
 or
 making
 sure
 the


team's
 lead
 announcer
 had
 his
 usual
 bag


of
 lucky
 Cheetos.


So
 again,
 that's
 hiring
 witches,


lighting
 a
 ginormous
 candle,
 or
 lucky


Cheetos.
 Which
 of
 those
 did
 they
 not


try?


The
 answer,


all
 of
 those
 were
 mariners
 techniques


except
 for
 the
 candle.
 That
 was
 part
 of


the
 routine
 of
 the
 Blue
 Jays,
 the
 team


that
 beat
 them
 to
 reach
 the
 World


Series.
 Hiring
 a
 witch
 off
 Etsy,


meanwhile,
 has
 actually
 become
 kind
 of
 a


thing
 in
 the
 last
 few
 years,
 not
 just


for
 slightly
 desperate
 sports
 fans.


Online,
 you
 can
 buy
 a
 spell
 to
 help
 you


win
 a
 legal
 case
 or
 one
 that
 promises
 to


get
 your
 ex
 to
 come
 back.
 The
 Mariners


fan
 said
 he
 paid
 about
 $16
 for
 his


custom
 spell.
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 guess


that
 witchcraft
 is
 non-refundable.


That
 is
 it
