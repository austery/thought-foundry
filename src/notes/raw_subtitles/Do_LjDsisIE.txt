My
 daily
 routine
 is
 essentially
 waking


up
 between
 like
 5:30
 a.m.
 to
 6
 o'clock


a.m.
 every
 day.
 And
 I
 quite
 literally


just
 roll
 out
 of
 bed,
 then
 I
 go
 straight


to
 Berries.
 And
 one
 thing
 about
 me
 is
 I


literally
 got
 my
 house
 specifically


because
 it's
 5
 minutes
 away
 from
 Berries


and
 5
 minutes
 from
 the
 office.
 So
 I
 can


reduce
 my
 commute
 and
 I
 don't
 really


need
 a
 car,
 which
 is
 awesome.
 I
 shower


and
 I
 hit
 work.
 Afterwards,
 I'm
 usually


just
 in
 like
 backtoback
 meetings.
 I
 try


to
 sometimes
 block
 off
 time
 because
 like


I
 need
 to
 like
 be
 in
 Figma
 and
 like


actually
 get
 feedback
 on
 design
 because


I'm
 usually
 working
 until
 maybe
 like
 8


o'clock,
 nine
 o'clock.
 I'll
 get
 dinner,


then
 I'll
 go
 back
 to
 work,
 and
 then
 um


I'll
 fall
 asleep
 sometime
 between
 like


11:00
 p.m.
 to
 1:00
 a.m.
 depending
 on
 the


day,
 and
 then
 repeat.
 You
 know,
 in
 YC,


they
 tell
 you
 you
 should
 only
 be
 doing


three
 things,
 which
 is
 like
 working
 out,


talking
 to
 customers,
 and
 building.
 I


see
 like
 why
 working
 out
 is
 so
 important


because
 it
 puts
 you
 on
 a
 schedule,
 tests


your
 discipline.
 like
 no
 matter
 how


shitty
 I'm
 feeling,
 I
 will
 still
 get
 up


and
 go
 out
 and
 work
 out
 because
 I
 know


I'm
 going
 to
 feel
 better
 and
 have
 more


energy
 to
 be
 better
 at
 my
 job
 the
 rest


of
 the
 day.
 So
 why
 my
 life
 looks
 like
 it


is
 today,
 but
 like
 don't
 sit
 still


essentially.
 I
 don't
 waste
 time


scrolling
 through
 Tik
 Tok,
 watching
 TV,


watching
 movies,
 etc.
 And
 I
 think
 by
 not


sitting
 still,
 I've
 been
 able
 to
 really


be
 efficient
 with
 my
 time
 and
 invest
 it


in
 things
 that
 make
 me
 happy.


Hi,
 I'm
 Lucy
 Glow.
 I
 am
 the
 founder
 of


Scale
 AI
 and
 passes
 back
 in
 capital


Capital
 and
 HFZ.
 I
 angel
 invest.
 I've


invested
 in
 over
 a
 100
 different


companies.
 Um,
 and
 I'm
 excited
 to
 chat


with
 you
 guys
 today.


I
 think
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 how
 it's


potentially
 changed
 my
 life.
 Um,
 my
 DMs


are
 popping.


Not
 life-changing,
 but
 it's
 been
 cool.
 I


mean,
 I
 think
 overall
 probably
 just
 like


what
 makes
 me
 happy.
 Um,
 everyone's


like,
 "Okay,
 cool.
 Like
 what
 are
 you


buying
 with
 your
 money,
 etc."
 But
 like


at
 the
 end
 of the
 day
 like
 what
 makes
 me


happy
 is
 like
 what
 drives
 every
 single


thing
 I
 do.
 Um
 whether
 it's
 like
 you


know
 building
 passes
 because
 it
 makes
 me


happy
 because
 it
 provides
 challenges
 in


my
 life
 but
 I
 also
 get
 to
 like
 you
 know


change
 people's
 lives.
 So
 at
 passes
 were


building
 infrastructure
 for
 creators
 to


monetize
 their
 brand.
 So
 I
 think
 when


you
 look
 at
 the
 largest
 creators
 they


really
 are
 like
 unicorns.
 For
 example


Kim
 Kardashian
 built
 skims.
 Logan
 Paul


built
 Prime.
 Mr.
 Beast
 with
 Fastables.


I'm
 excited
 for
 us
 to
 eventually
 build
 a


unicorn
 creator.


[Music]


I
 think
 I
 got
 suspended
 from


kindergarten
 to
 be
 quite
 honest.
 I
 think


it
 came
 from
 like
 me
 telling
 the
 teacher


that
 what
 we
 were
 learning
 was
 dumb.
 But


if
 you
 think
 about
 it,
 like
 my
 parents


were
 trying
 to
 teach
 me
 like
 I
 was
 going


to
 like
 abacus
 competitions
 like


multiplication,
 division,
 etc.
 back
 in


like
 kindergarten.
 And
 in
 school
 they


were
 literally
 like
 here's
 the
 alphabet,


right?
 Um,
 and
 I
 was
 just
 very
 bored
 as


a
 child.
 So,
 I
 was
 always
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 like
 different
 things
 to
 do.


I
 was
 like
 learning
 stuff
 on
 my
 own.


Specifically,
 like
 the
 stuff
 I
 learned


was
 to
 like
 make
 money.
 But
 eventually,


I
 discovered
 my
 love
 for
 product
 and
 I


was
 like, "Oh,
 this
 is
 actually
 really


fun."
 Um,
 but
 you
 could
 see
 glimpses
 of


it
 where
 like,
 you
 know,
 I
 tried
 to


start
 my
 own
 virtual
 pet
 site
 after


being
 addicted
 to
 Neopets.
 I
 was
 playing


a
 lot
 of
 online
 video
 games.
 I
 was


figuring
 out
 how
 to
 start
 my
 own
 online


arcade
 game
 website.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think


what
 really
 shaped
 how
 I'm
 an


entrepreneur
 today
 is
 that
 through
 like


the
 early
 stages
 of
 me
 like
 making


money,
 my
 parents
 found
 all
 of
 my
 hidden


cash
 and
 would
 take
 it
 away.
 So
 then
 I


was
 like,
 I
 have
 to
 like
 figure
 out
 how


they
 don't
 take
 away
 cash.
 PayPal
 had


come
 out
 and
 then
 you
 could
 just
 go
 like


buy
 a
 Visa
 debit
 card,
 open
 up
 a
 PayPal


account
 and
 that's
 when
 I
 started


learning
 how
 to
 make
 money
 on
 the


internet
 and
 then
 that's
 when
 I
 got


curious
 about
 building
 my
 own
 websites


and
 then
 like
 that
 kind
 of
 led
 to


hackathons
 and
 then
 I
 would
 say
 like
 the


turning
 point
 of
 like
 real


entrepreneurship
 and
 like
 wanting
 to


build
 lasting
 companies
 like
 more
 than


just
 bots,
 right?
 Um
 was
 at
 these


hackathons
 where
 suddenly
 I
 was
 exposed


to
 startup
 world
 and
 I
 was
 like
 wow
 I


can
 build
 apps
 that
 like
 millions
 of


people
 use
 this
 is
 really
 really
 cool.


Both
 my
 parents
 are
 absolutely


brilliant.
 They're
 both
 technical.
 I


think
 it
 was
 interesting
 because
 they


actually
 really
 discouraged
 me
 from


pursuing
 a
 technical
 field
 because
 they


kind
 of
 imagined
 like
 my
 place
 as
 a


woman
 was
 to
 get
 married
 and
 pop
 out


grandchildren,
 but
 they
 still
 wanted
 me


in
 an
 intelligent
 environment
 to
 find
 an


intelligent
 partner.
 I
 think
 I
 ended
 up


pursuing
 it
 almost
 by
 accident.
 Um,
 I


thought
 I
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 chemical


engineer
 because
 I
 was
 like
 like


chemistry
 was
 my
 favorite
 subject.
 like


I
 loved
 AP
 chemistry
 and
 I
 was
 very
 good


at
 it.
 But
 when
 I
 I
 ended
 up
 on
 this


website,
 College
 Confidential,
 like
 I


need
 help
 with
 my
 college
 applications


and
 um
 there's
 this
 random
 stranger
 who


literally
 looked
 at
 my
 extracurriculars


and
 it
 was
 like
 you're
 an
 idiot.
 If
 you


want
 to
 get
 into
 best
 college,
 just


apply
 for
 computer
 science
 and
 I
 was


like,
 I
 guess
 that
 makes
 sense.
 So


that's
 actually
 like
 kind
 of
 how
 I
 just


landed
 in
 computer
 science.
 My
 college


days
 are
 like
 I
 was
 going
 to
 a
 lot
 of


hackathons.
 So
 like
 you
 know
 every
 few


weeks
 M
 hacks
 hack
 MIT
 quite
 literally


every
 hackathon
 I
 like
 was
 like
 I'm


going
 to
 go
 to
 and
 then
 I
 made
 a
 lot
 of


friends
 and
 I
 say
 this
 because
 like
 I


might
 be
 biased
 but
 um
 like
 when
 I
 was


first
 hiring
 like
 the
 first
 people
 I


went
 to
 were
 the
 friends
 I
 made
 in


college
 and
 they
 didn't
 even
 ask
 any


questions
 which
 is
 concerning.
 They


definitely
 should
 have
 asked
 how
 much


their
 equity
 was
 worth,
 but
 um
 they
 were


just
 like,
 "Yeah,
 like
 we'd
 love
 to
 come


work
 with
 you."
 YOLO.
 Right.
 And
 that


was
 cuz
 there
 was
 that
 trust
 that
 was


gained
 in
 college.
 When
 you're
 building


your
 next
 company,
 um
 your
 network
 is


your
 net
 worth
 and
 like
 you're
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 hire
 the
 friends
 that
 you


made
 in
 college
 and
 you
 know
 they're


good.


I
 I
 think
 if
 I
 didn't
 have
 a
 rebellious


nature,
 I
 probably
 would
 have
 been
 the


good
 girl
 that
 my
 parents
 wanted
 me
 to


be
 and
 stayed
 in
 college,
 right?
 And


like
 I
 knew
 I
 was
 hurting
 them
 when


going
 to
 um
 do
 this,
 but
 I
 think
 that


like
 part
 of
 the
 rebellious
 nature
 was
 I


want
 to
 prove
 you
 wrong
 and
 show
 you


that
 I
 can
 forge
 my
 own
 path
 and
 I
 will


be
 successful
 without
 college.
 Um
 so
 I'm


sorry
 I'm
 hurting
 you
 right
 now,
 but


like
 it'll
 be
 worth
 it
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day.
 Um
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 ever
 doubted
 it.


And
 what
 helped
 me
 commit
 was
 just


thinking
 like
 this
 is
 not
 a
 risk
 at
 all.


Um
 like
 college
 is
 always
 going
 to
 be


there
 versus
 this
 is
 a
 once
 in


a-lifetime
 opportunity
 and
 I'm
 going
 to


be
 learning
 a
 lot.
 I
 feel
 like
 I'm
 not


learning
 practical
 skills
 in
 college
 and


everything
 that
 I've
 learned
 was
 through


like
 hackathons,
 right?
 So,
 if
 I
 leave


college
 and
 I
 dive
 myself
 in
 the
 startup


world,
 I
 am
 going
 to
 learn
 significantly


more
 and
 be
 able
 to
 like
 actually
 build


products
 that
 millions
 of
 people
 use


versus
 learning
 theoretical
 skills
 that


like
 I'm
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 use
 in
 my


job.
 Um,
 so
 I
 was
 pretty
 like
 dead
 set


on
 it
 early
 on.
 I
 think
 my
 conviction


was
 to
 optimize
 learning.
 So,
 I've


always
 like
 that's
 been
 my
 number
 one


rule
 in
 life.
 Like
 even
 if
 you
 are


leaving
 something,
 it
 feels
 like
 a
 risk.


It's
 not
 that
 much
 of
 a
 risk
 if
 you're


optimizing
 learning
 because
 your


knowledge
 is
 always
 going
 to
 be
 worth


something.
 And
 the
 more
 knowledge
 you


gain,
 the
 more
 valuable
 you
 are
 later
 on


in
 life.
 I
 think
 the
 reaction
 I
 got
 from


most
 people
 was,
 "You're
 a


idiot."
 From
 my
 parents
 to
 my
 friends
 to


like
 people
 who
 didn't
 know
 me.
 Um


people
 were
 just
 like,
 "Yo,
 like
 what


are
 you
 doing?"
 A
 lot
 of
 it
 stem
 from


the
 fact
 that
 I
 actually
 only
 had
 four


CS
 classes
 left
 to
 graduate,
 like
 one


year
 left,
 right?
 So
 I
 think
 the
 like


risk
 mental
 calculation
 didn't
 really


make
 sense
 for
 others
 but
 for
 me
 I
 was


like
 what
 am
 I
 I'm
 losing
 time
 right
 but


like
 what's
 the
 worst
 case
 scenario
 I


take
 a
 job
 what's
 the
 second
 worst
 case


scenario
 I
 go
 back
 to
 college
 I
 chose


like
 to
 optimize
 for
 that
 learning
 and


like
 optimize
 for
 being
 in
 a
 network
 of


like
 extremely
 ambitious
 intelligent


people


as
 a
 founder
 you
 already
 know
 ideas
 are


the
 easy
 part
 it's
 the
 execution


actually
 building
 the
 product
 that
 slows


everything
 down.
 That's
 where
 Lovable


comes
 in.

 not
 just
 an
 AI

I
 think
 at
 SNAP
 I
 really
 learned
 how
 to


think
 much
 bigger.
 Um,
 like
 when
 I
 first


joined
 Snap,
 I
 didn't
 realize
 like
 kind


of
 the
 vision
 Evan
 had
 for
 Snap.
 And
 it


was
 very
 inspiring
 seeing
 like
 his
 ideas


on
 how
 he
 would
 eventually
 compete
 with


Amazon,
 um,
 compete
 with
 Google,
 etc.,


which
 I
 think
 like
 no
 one
 even
 to
 this


day
 thinks
 about
 Snap
 competing
 with


Amazon
 or
 Google.
 But
 to
 see
 him
 think


so
 innovatively
 about
 product
 and
 not


care
 about
 like
 that
 AB
 test
 portion
 of


things
 taught
 me
 just
 a
 lot
 about
 like


the
 importance
 of
 being
 open-minded
 and


like
 product
 driven
 as
 well
 and
 really


about
 like
 perfection.
 Um
 I
 the
 lesson
 I


really
 took
 away
 from
 that
 is
 like
 just


get
 to
 90%.
 You
 don't
 need
 to
 spend
 3


years
 going
 back
 and
 forth
 on
 a
 design.


Um,
 but
 also
 like
 I
 remember
 there
 was


like
 that
 zoom
 out
 the
 snap
 mapaps


feature
 that
 like
 no
 one
 at
 the
 company


wanted
 to
 build
 because
 everyone
 thought


it
 was
 so
 dumb
 and
 he
 was
 just
 like
 kept


on
 insisting
 it
 and
 it
 turns
 out
 like
 he


was
 right
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 right?


Um,
 it
 ended
 up
 like
 being
 a
 very


natural
 UX
 that
 people
 love
 and
 use.


That
 really
 almost
 tells
 you
 also
 that


like
 people
 don't
 really
 know
 what
 they


want
 in
 the
 consumer
 field,
 right?
 Like


it
 might
 sound
 like
 the
 dumbest
 thing,


but
 you
 really
 just
 have
 to
 like
 kind
 of


give
 it
 a
 go.
 Um
 hence
 like
 why
 he
 was


probably
 just
 like
 you
 know
 just


thinking
 eventually
 like
 don't
 think


about
 like
 all
 this
 like
 research


feedback
 etc
 because
 um
 if
 he
 did
 that


like
 that
 would
 have
 never
 been
 shipped


but
 like
 once
 it
 got
 into
 the
 hands
 of


people
 um
 they
 realized
 like
 oh
 I


actually
 I
 wanted
 this
 but
 no
 one
 could


have
 told
 you
 that.
 When
 you
 come
 up


with
 a
 product
 spend
 like
 2
 weeks


designing
 it
 and
 then
 ship
 it
 and
 see


how
 it
 does
 and
 if
 there's
 traction
 then


go
 and
 iterate
 and
 improve
 on
 it.
 But


people
 will
 use
 products
 they
 want
 to


use
 even
 if
 it's
 super
 buggy
 and
 the
 UX


is
 shitty
 for
 the
 most
 part.
 So
 um
 it's


better
 to
 ship
 that
 like
 90%
 with
 like


no
 user
 research
 and
 then
 double
 down
 on


the
 product
 like
 if
 it
 gets
 traction


versus
 wasting
 like
 months
 doing
 all


this
 research
 etc
 and
 shipping
 it
 and


like
 it
 might
 fall
 flat.
 I
 mean
 I
 would


say
 it's
 like
 risk
 benefit
 analysis
 and


then
 am
 I
 learning
 right?
 So
 for
 example


like
 when
 I
 was
 at
 Snap
 I
 was
 giving
 up


a
 few
 million
 dollars
 but
 I
 also
 was


like
 that's
 not
 life-changing
 for
 me.


So,
 I
 would
 rather
 optimize
 learning
 and


also
 have
 the
 opportunity
 to
 make


life-changing
 money.
 And
 if
 I
 don't
 make


that
 life-changing
 money,
 um,
 at least
 I


learned
 a
 bunch
 of
 like
 new
 knowledge


and
 I'll
 be
 able
 to
 like
 hop
 to
 my
 next


job
 and
 make
 more.
 And
 all
 I'm
 losing
 is


like
 what,
 one
 to
 two
 years
 because


that's
 the
 amount
 of
 time
 it
 would
 take


to
 like
 figure
 out
 like
 am
 I
 going
 to


like
 be
 able
 to
 build
 this
 company


unless
 you're
 crazy.
 Like
 I
 have
 friends


that
 like,
 you
 know,
 pivoted
 for
 like


six
 years
 and
 then
 finally
 found


something
 which
 like
 those
 are
 obviously


the
 founders
 I
 love
 investing
 in.
 If
 I


were
 making
 like
 a
 hund00
 million
 at


SNAP,
 like
 would
 I
 have
 made
 that
 jump?


Like
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 realistic.
 Probably


not.
 I
 probably
 been
 like
 that's


life-changing
 money.
 It
 is
 worth
 staying


four
 years
 for
 $100
 million
 before


moving
 on.
 Um
 so,
 um
 I
 would
 say
 like


those
 two
 things
 are
 like
 my
 criteria


when
 choosing
 like
 when
 to
 make
 moves.


We
 were
 both
 working
 at
 Kora
 and
 like
 I


think
 it
 was
 literally
 over
 lunch
 we


were
 like,
 "Huh,
 should
 we
 start
 a


company
 together
 one
 day?"
 I
 was
 like,


"Yeah,
 let's
 do
 it."
 And
 then
 over
 like


winter
 break,
 we
 started
 iterating
 on


ideas.
 So
 um
 we
 came
 up
 with
 a
 horrible


one.
 Class
 passed
 for
 clubbing
 and
 you


know
 it
 got
 traction
 but
 you
 know
 it's


bad
 when
 it's
 only
 VCs
 that
 are


subscribing
 to
 your
 service.
 And
 then
 we


were
 like
 okay
 let's
 go
 do
 something


more
 meaningful.
 So
 um
 we
 pivoted
 to
 Ava


which
 is
 um
 a
 healthcare
 app
 that
 we


help
 you
 find
 like
 the
 best
 doctors
 for


specific
 procedures.
 So
 it's
 like
 oh
 you


need
 a
 root
 canal.
 Here
 is
 like
 the
 best


person
 to
 give
 you
 a
 root
 canal.
 Um,


also
 a
 terrible
 idea,
 but
 the
 idea
 ended


up
 getting
 us
 into
 YC.
 Um,
 I
 think


mostly
 because
 I
 knew
 we
 were
 going
 to


get
 into
 YC
 because
 I
 was
 like
 talking


to
 um,
 YC
 partners
 before
 the
 interview


and
 after
 the
 interview
 and
 they
 were


just
 like,
 "Oh
 yeah,
 like
 you'll
 get
 in


because
 like
 you
 guys
 are
 both
 super


smart.
 You're
 obviously
 at
 SNAP
 and
 a


teal
 fellow
 and
 he
 is
 like
 you
 know


MIT."
 So
 yeah,
 we
 uh,
 entered
 YC
 and


then
 the
 idea
 was
 terrible.
 So
 we
 ended


up
 pivoting
 to
 scale.


I
 think
 like
 generalized
 my
 most
 painful


failures
 have
 been
 trusting
 people
 that


I
 shouldn't
 have
 trusted
 which
 is
 just


not
 great.
 Um
 especially
 in
 the


workplace
 for
 example
 like
 you
 might


trust
 an
 employee
 and
 then
 like
 when


they
 underperform
 and
 you
 need
 to
 fire


them
 they
 decide
 to
 try
 to
 extort
 you.


It's
 just
 like
 you
 need
 to
 make
 sure


that
 like
 be
 like
 you
 don't
 want
 people


where
 like
 you
 constantly
 feel
 like


they're
 going
 to
 like
 stab
 you
 in
 the


back
 on
 figuring
 out
 on
 who
 to
 trust.


This
 is
 very
 cliche
 but
 go
 with
 your


gut.
 Um,
 but
 outside
 of
 going
 with
 your


gut,
 like
 you
 should
 definitely
 just
 do


like
 reference
 checks
 on
 both
 like


friends,
 like
 people
 that
 know
 them
 or


like
 people
 that
 aren't
 even
 friends,


you
 know,
 like
 acquaintances
 cuz
 like


you're
 probably
 going
 to
 get
 a
 more


honest
 answer
 from
 acquaintances.
 I


think
 the
 best
 way
 to
 build
 trust
 again


is
 like
 be
 extremely
 authentic.
 But
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 if
 like
 trust
 is


broken,
 like
 sometimes
 it
 can't
 be


repaired
 and
 that's
 when
 you
 know
 that


like
 you
 might
 just
 need
 to
 separate
 and


maturity
 is
 understanding
 that.


I
 think
 the
 team
 self
 motivates
 themsel


but
 it's
 innovation
 when
 they
 see
 that


like
 we
 can
 ship
 a
 product
 in
 two
 weeks


and
 it
 takes
 a
 large
 company
 like
 that's


stagnant
 like
 years
 to
 ship
 a
 product


that's
 extremely
 exciting
 for
 the
 team


especially
 when
 like
 you
 tie
 that


product
 to
 actual
 revenue
 numbers
 and
 I


think
 it's
 just
 constantly
 emphasizing


that
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 a
 lot
 of


engineers
 choose
 to
 work
 at
 startups


instead
 of
 larger
 companies
 because
 they


feel
 like
 they
 have
 more
 impact.
 Impact


is
 what
 motivates
 them
 because
 they're


not
 going
 to
 get
 that
 same
 impact
 at
 a


large
 company.
 leaders
 need
 to
 be
 doing


IC
 work
 as
 well
 because
 the
 only
 way
 you


can
 judge
 people
 on
 like
 their
 actual


job
 is
 if
 you
 do
 the
 job
 yourself
 and


like
 really
 it's
 all
 hands-
 on
 deck
 like


nothing
 is
 too
 big
 to
 be
 done.
 So
 for


example
 like
 everyone
 was
 on
 intercom


when
 we
 got
 a
 pilot
 for
 like
 a
 new


customer
 quite
 literally
 we'd
 have
 a
 war


room
 with
 like
 engineers
 like
 me
 etc.


And
 like
 we'd
 all
 be
 labeling
 that
 data


and
 making
 sure
 it's
 perfect.
 We
 really


emphasize
 like
 nothing
 is
 below
 you.


you're
 going
 to
 do
 what's
 best
 for
 the


company.
 And
 if
 like
 your
 time
 is
 best


being
 spent
 like
 helping
 close
 this


deal,
 then
 like
 you're
 going
 to
 do
 that.


Let's
 say
 you're
 running
 customer


support
 and
 you're
 not
 doing
 the


customer
 support
 tickets
 yourself,


you're
 not
 going
 to
 know
 if
 your


customer
 support
 reps
 are
 answering
 them


fast
 enough,
 giving
 the
 correct
 answers


or
 like
 if
 you
 know
 if
 it's
 not
 obvious


answer
 like
 should
 they
 know
 this
 the


answer
 to
 this
 or
 is
 it
 like
 something


more
 obscure?
 And
 you
 really
 only
 get


that
 like
 muscle
 if
 you
 you
 do
 the
 work.


I
 think
 the
 number
 one
 thing
 I
 look
 for


is
 like
 intelligence
 and
 hard
 work


because
 you
 can
 be
 the
 smartest
 person


ever,
 but
 if
 you
 don't
 work
 hard,
 you're


going
 to
 not
 impact
 a
 company.
 Hard
 work


is
 extremely
 important
 to
 me,
 especially


cuz
 like
 with
 creators,
 we're
 very


creator
 first.
 That's
 our
 culture.
 Which


means
 that
 like
 because
 creators
 can
 be


24/7.
 We
 need
 to
 be
 24/7.
 Like
 if
 a


creator
 hits
 me
 up
 at
 like
 2
 am
 like


about
 a
 bug,
 I'm
 proud
 to
 say
 that
 I
 can


call
 my
 engineers
 like
 and
 one
 of
 them


will
 pick
 up
 and
 fix
 that
 bug
 at
 2
 am,


which
 is
 incredibly
 important
 in
 an


industry
 like
 this.
 Um,
 and
 I
 look
 for


people
 that
 are
 willing
 to
 like
 go
 the


extra
 mile.
 That's
 not
 saying
 like
 you


have
 to
 work
 every
 weekend,
 but
 like
 if


needed,
 like
 are
 you
 going
 to
 show
 up?


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 as
 a
 leader,
 one


of
 my
 like
 biggest
 values
 in
 life
 is


just
 kindness.
 It's
 like
 you're
 wanting


the
 best
 for
 everyone,
 right?
 Like
 if


someone
 wins,
 awesome.
 Like
 if
 I
 lose
 an


amazing
 engineer,
 um
 I
 still
 want
 to


help
 them
 like
 succeed.
 If
 I
 lose
 a


crappy
 engineer,
 I
 still
 want
 to
 help


them
 succeed.
 For
 me,
 I'm
 like
 I
 think


I'm
 very
 giving
 as
 like
 both
 a
 person


and
 a
 leader.
 So
 it's
 like,
 okay,
 like


you
 know,
 I
 give
 you
 chances.
 I
 like
 try


to
 you're
 not
 working
 out
 in
 your
 role,


but
 I
 think
 that
 you're
 hardworking
 and


smart.
 I
 try
 to
 find
 like
 a
 role
 that


like
 you
 might
 be
 better
 suited
 for.


So
 I
 would
 say
 it
 was
 a
 mix
 of
 things.


Um,
 I
 think
 what
 inspired
 me
 was


actually
 living
 with
 all
 the
 founders.


Like
 their
 energy
 definitely
 grew
 on
 me


and
 I
 wanted
 these
 founders
 to
 start


bases,
 but
 no
 one
 would
 do
 it.
 And


around
 the
 same
 time,
 I
 had
 a
 friend
 who


asked
 me
 to
 be
 CEO
 of
 his
 AI
 company.


And
 I
 kind
 of
 sat
 on
 it
 like
 I
 kind
 of


got
 excited,
 right?
 I
 was
 like, "Oh
 my


god,
 like
 I
 feel
 ready
 to
 be
 a
 founder


again."
 Uh
 cuz
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 the


reason
 why
 I
 wasn't
 I
 didn't
 do
 it


sooner
 was
 cuz
 I
 was
 scared
 of
 failure.


But
 I
 finally
 got
 to
 a
 point
 where
 I
 was


like,
 you
 know what?
 If
 I
 fail,


whatever,
 it
 doesn't
 matter.
 like
 my


life
 is
 going
 to
 be
 fine.
 most
 people


don't
 build
 two
 successful
 startups
 like


don't
 be
 scared
 of
 failure
 and
 just
 go


and
 do
 the
 thing
 right
 and
 I
 didn't
 feel


like
 doing
 an
 AI
 company
 again
 to
 be


quite
 honest
 I
 was
 like
 I
 did
 B2B


enterprise
 I
 know
 how
 it
 works
 but
 I


would
 rather
 like
 if
 I'm
 doing
 a
 second


company
 and
 like
 risking
 failure
 at


least
 have
 fun
 doing
 it
 and
 I
 had
 always


been
 attracted
 consumer
 you
 can
 see
 this


with
 like
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 like


random
 apps
 I
 had
 made
 Snap
 was
 like
 one


of
 the
 most
 fun
 experiences
 of
 my
 life


so
 uh
 I
 like
 just
 knew
 I
 wanted
 to
 do


consumer
 and
 I
 had
 been
 sitting
 on
 this


idea
 idea
 for
 a
 little
 bit.
 So,
 I
 was


like, "Okay,
 like
 let's
 see
 some


competitors
 out
 there."
 And
 really,
 you


could
 only
 find
 like
 Patreon.
 They've


existed
 for
 a
 decade
 and
 I
 saw
 like
 an


opportunity
 in
 the
 market.
 Um,
 I
 was


friends
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 creators.
 Um,
 I


lightly
 asked
 my
 creator
 friends
 like,


"Hey,
 if
 I
 were
 to
 build
 this,
 would


they
 you
 use
 it?"
 So,
 you
 know,
 like


selling
 before
 building,
 they're
 like,


"Absolutely."
 I
 was
 like,
 "Great."
 And


then
 I
 just
 talked
 to
 my
 LPs
 and
 they


were
 like,
 "Here
 is
 money.
 Um,
 go


build."
 So,
 um,
 it
 all
 happened
 really


quickly.
 like
 I
 would
 say
 within
 the


span
 of
 like
 24
 hours
 of
 my
 friend


asking
 me
 to
 like
 be
 CEO
 of
 his
 AI


company
 and
 me
 having
 like
 commitments.


So
 the
 future
 I
 see
 for
 the
 creator


economy
 I
 think
 that
 like
 AI
 is
 really


going
 to
 help
 creators
 be
 co-pilots.
 I


see
 more
 creators
 becoming


entrepreneurs.
 More
 kids
 want
 to
 be


creators
 than
 ever
 before.
 So
 I
 think


the
 creator
 economy
 is
 going
 to
 grow
 but


also
 everyone
 like
 creator
 marketing


spend
 is
 going
 up
 in
 like
 pretty
 much


every
 country.
 And
 I
 think
 this
 is
 due


to
 the
 fact
 people
 are
 realizing
 like


their
 audience
 and
 like
 the
 like
 reach


you
 get
 is
 much
 stronger
 spending
 it
 on


creator
 marketing
 versus
 on
 ads.
 So,
 I


think
 because
 of
 this,
 um,
 we're
 going


to
 see
 more
 creators
 work
 so
 closely


with
 brands
 that
 they're
 essentially


considered
 co-founders
 or
 start
 their


own
 brands,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 think
 like


unicorn
 creators
 are
 possible
 and
 like


we're
 excited
 to
 help
 them
 either
 get


access
 the
 best
 brands
 and
 like
 get
 that


equity
 for
 long-term
 generational
 wealth


or
 if
 it
 makes
 sense
 to
 like
 help
 them


build
 that
 next
 product.


I
 think
 if
 20-year-old
 me
 could
 go
 back


in
 time,
 I
 would
 stop
 complaining
 about


some
 of
 the
 people
 I
 work
 with
 and
 just


start
 really
 like
 getting
 to
 know
 them


better
 and
 uplifting
 them.
 Why
 do
 I


think
 so?
 Um,
 I
 think
 that
 like
 in


general
 most
 companies
 are
 very
 gossipy,


right?
 So,
 if
 you're
 complaining
 about


people,
 like
 it
 just
 gets
 around
 and


then
 it
 drives
 them
 away
 obviously


because
 they
 hear
 about
 complaints
 like


no
 one
 wants
 to
 be
 talked
 badly
 about.


And
 I
 think
 like
 the
 best
 work


environments
 and
 the
 most
 positive
 ones


are
 when
 you
 are
 like
 everyone's


cheerleader.
 So,
 uh
 I
 think
 I
 would
 have


like
 spent
 more
 effort
 like
 seeing
 the


good
 in
 people.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 sound


very
 LA,
 but
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 have
 like


manifested
 everything
 in
 my
 life.
 And


because
 I'm
 like
 focus
 so
 much
 on


positive
 energy,
 I
 feel
 like
 as
 long
 as


I
 like
 put
 in
 that
 hard
 work
 to
 like


bring
 my
 dreams
 to
 life
 and
 like


surround
 myself
 with
 positive
 people,


like
 anything
 is
 possible.
 so
 cheesy,


but
 I
 really
 like
 do
 believe
 that's


true.
 And
 like
 I
 have
 like
 the
 best


friends
 in
 the
 world
 that,
 you
 know,
 are


constantly
 around
 me
 and
 encouraging
 me


and
 like
 really
 doing
 whatever
 they
 can


to
 help.
 Like
 they'll
 go
 out
 of
 my
 way.


They're
 like
 truly
 incredible.
 And
 I


think
 that
 like
 when
 I
 have
 like
 such


positive
 people
 around
 me,
 like
 I
 only


look
 at
 like
 upside
