- This is Tom Brady.
He's the greatest American
football quarterback of all time.
Holy.
- Can you hear it
go by you?
- (laughing) Yeah, it's scary.
(dynamic music)
He's won seven Super Bowls
and has thrown the most
touchdown passes in history.
- Ooh.
- Ooh, that one
hurt the chest, I heard that.
- Right in the chest.
- I'm like
glad I'm not catching those.
- Every quarterback takes pride
in their ability to throw a tight spiral.
The tighter the spiral you throw
means the more control
you have of the football.
- We analyzed his throw in detail.
Have people shot you in really slow motion
for the release and everything?
- Never.
- And discovered
something surprising.
Even Tom Brady can't
throw a perfect spiral.
Just look.
- Said hut.
- On his deep passes,
no matter how hard he tries
to spin the ball cleanly
around its long axis,
if you look closely enough,
you'll notice this little wobble.
Not only that, there's a
slight drift to the ball,
which means even Tom Brady
can't throw straight.
Virtually all his long
passes curve to the right.
But these aren't mistakes,
they're actually
fundamental to the physics
of throwing a football accurately.
To find out why,
we ran a full computational
fluid dynamics analysis,
tested spinning balls in a wind tunnel,
and even embedded sensors
in real footballs.
- That's crazy.
- Now, admittedly,
who are we to tell Tom Brady
anything about football?
(inquisitive music)
(Derek grunting)
I've never really played much football.
I grew up in Canada.
I'd be much happier to be playing hockey.
Like why can't I throw at all?
That is so rough.
- Okay, well, he'll walk you through it,
I'm not gonna bother
doing it (laughing) right now.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
(upbeat music)
- Try to do this,
over-exaggerate the tilt.
So instead of standing
straight up-
- Yeah, lean forward?
- lean like you're almost
like a shortstop, right,
and like you're falling over,
and then you're just here,
like that.
(Derek grunting and laughing)
- Good catch.
- So lean over
a little bit.
- I feel like I'm like
not ready for it.
- So get down
like a shortstop.
- Yeah, yeah,
like this?
- Even more.
- Even more?
- Yeah.
Now throw it sidearm.
- Yeah?
I feel like this is weird.
There you go, that was a better throw.
- That is a better throw.
- It was really good.
- [Derek] What's the key to throwing
like a really tight spiral?
- The key to me is, first of all,
you gotta have very light grip pressure
on the football.
I learned over a period of time
that I had to be really
efficient with my mechanics.
I had to have all my energy
going right toward the target
with a very relaxed posture.
And then it's a really smooth,
efficient throwing motion.
- [Derek] And then how
are you actually imparting
the spin to the ball?
- So you're really popping
your wrist at the end.
So I can even go really slow
and just pop my wrist at the end.
And even that little bit of wrist pop
will create a little snap on the ball
as it releases from my fingertips.
Henry, you can't drop the easy one.
(bright music)
- That snap and the spin it creates
is the key to Brady's
record-breaking throw.
But the big question is why?
I mean, what does the spin
actually do to the football?
(audience cheering)
It seems like such a simple question,
but the physics turned out
to be much more complicated
than I initially thought.
In fact, physicists studying the problem
didn't get close to the real answer
until just five years ago.
So let's break it down from the start.
A question for Tom is,
can he throw the ball without spinning it.
- Like a knuckleball?
- Yeah, can you knuckleball a football?
- Yeah, I could try.
Can I throw it underhand?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, however you
wanna toss it.
- Even overhand, there's no way to do it
without getting a spin on it
or it's just gonna mess with you?
- I mean, you'd have to
almost throw it sideways.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, that spun a little bit.
- When you launch a ball without spin,
perfectly aligned with
the direction of motion,
it seems like the air
flowing over the ball
will be totally symmetric.
But this is unstable.
Any slight disturbance,
like a tiny bit of wind,
will cause more air to hit
one side than the other,
and that starts to change
the ball's orientation.
And now more area on that side
is exposed to the oncoming air,
so it deflects even more.
So drag on the ball increases,
it's pushed off course,
and it can begin to tumble.
The total drag force on the ball
is proportional to the area
presented to the airflow
and the drag coefficient.
That's just a measure of how
streamlined an object is.
Pointed straight in the
direction of motion,
a football is pretty streamlined,
with a drag coefficient of just 0.14.
That's better than a bullet.
But on its side, the
drag coefficient is 0.85,
which is worse than a cow.
- Man, I'm learning a lot today.
That's what I'm gonna use
with all the quarterbacks,
going, "Man, your drag coefficient sucks."
(laughing)
"What are we doing?
We need .14.
.85, no good.
- To make matters worse,
when a football is going sideways,
it exposes nearly 70% more
area to the oncoming air.
And combined with the
higher drag coefficient,
this means that the drag force
is 10 times greater
than when the football is
aligned with the throw.
So an un-spinning ball
can end up going sideways,
meaning it decelerates
up to 10 times faster.
Plus, as it tumbles,
the air pushes on it in
different directions,
making it move unpredictably.
Now, in some cases,
you actually want this.
Like when kicking the ball
back to the other team,
punters sometimes intentionally
kick the ball end over end
so that it gets pushed around erratically.
That makes it far harder
for the opposing team
to predict where the ball's gonna go
and get under it.
But when you're passing to your own team,
you want the ball to be predictable
and go as fast and as far as possible.
And for that, you need spin.
(suspenseful music)
The benefits of spin
really became clear in the mid 1800s
during the Crimean War.
Back then, soldiers
were armed with muskets
that fired round lead balls.
And to make reloading
faster on the battlefield,
these musket balls were
made significantly smaller
than the barrel.
But when the gunpowder was ignited,
some of the expanding
gases would then escape
around the bullet,
making the bullet's exit
velocity unpredictable.
This, combined with
inconsistent manufacturing
and the round ball's poor aerodynamics,
meant that muskets were
somewhat unreliable.
- There was a British
army musketry instructor
who famously said,
"I'm willing to stand and
be shot at all day long,
as long as whoever's shooting at me
with the smoothbore musket
promises to aim at me every single time."
(Henry laughing)
Because he knew
the bullet's never actually gonna go
(laughing) where the gun is being aimed.
(pensive music)
- [Derek] All of that
changed in the fall of 1854.
Russian troops huddled in Sevastopol
under siege by French and British forces.
The soldiers watched as British troops
set up on a distant hillside.
They were far out of
standard musket range,
so the Russians weren't worried,
when suddenly
a window shatters.
(window smashing)
- They were shooting through the windows
of the Russian barracks at
their naval base in Sevastopol,
900 yards away,
they're shooting bullets
through the windows.
(window smashing)
- But these were
no ordinary bullets.
Eight years earlier,
an enterprising French army
officer, Claude-Etienne Minie,
made a breakthrough.
He developed a conical
bullet with a hollow base
and an iron plug that would fit into it.
So when fired,
the gas pressure drove
the plug into the base,
which expanded the bullet,
pressing it firmly
against the barrel walls
so no gas could escape.
This made the bullet's muzzle velocity
much more predictable.
But it also enabled something else.
The expanded bullet
could grip spiral grooves
carved into the inside of the barrel,
called rifling.
This imparted spinned the
bullet as it shot out.
And this is key
because all spinning objects
have a fundamental quantity
they can serve,
angular momentum.
This helps them resist
changes in their orientation.
It's just like the spinning top.
- Now, without spin,
the top just falls over like you'd expect.
But if we add a little bit of spin,
we can see that it resists
changes in its orientation.
So if I give it a little touch,
it reorients itself
in the direction of its angular momentum.
- [Derek] A similar thing
happens with a spinning bullet.
Its angular momentum resists changes
to its axis of rotation.
So even if wind applies an
unbalanced force to the bullet,
it maintains its orientation.
This reduces drag and helps
the projectile fly further,
faster and more accurately.
The exact same thing is going on
when Tom Brady throws a tight spiral.
- The important part of a spiral
is you feel the wind blown at us.
If the ball wobbles at all,
it's gonna catch a lot of
resistance in the wind,
and it's gonna slow the
velocity of the ball down a lot
and the accuracy.
The tighter the spiral
and the more it spins,
the more it can just
rotate through the air
and the wind will have a
less effect on the ball.
So for any good quarterback,
the ability to throw a tight spiral
is really important
when you play in windy conditions.
- A spinning ball will
maintain its orientation,
and therefore cut through the air
with a smaller frontal area
and a lower drag coefficient.
This all makes sense,
but here's where things get weird.
If the ball is maintaining its orientation
then on a long Hail Mary pass,
it should stay pitched up
like this the whole time,
just like when it was thrown.
But that is not what happens.
- There's kind of a paradox in football,
which is, when you release the ball,
you're angled say positive 30 degrees.
- Okay.
- And when your receiver catches it,
it's angled negative 30 degrees.
- Perfect, I love that.
- So what we just said was,
angular momentum makes
the ball hard to pivot.
- Okay.
- But what we saw
was it pitches from this
to this in four seconds.
- Right, turnover-
- Yes, exactly.
- is what we would call that.
Now, turnover is essential to a good throw
because it means at every
point along the arc,
the ball's orientation
stays closely aligned
with its direction of motion.
That means it stays pointed
directly into the airflow,
which minimizes drag.
Now, sure, you might think
this isn't that crazy?
I mean, arrows and birdies
align themselves along the
path of the arc as well.
But that works in these cases
because the objects are front weighted.
The feathers catch the air
and get pushed behind the heavier tip,
which leads the way.
But a football's totally different.
I mean, it doesn't have feathers or fins,
and its weight is evenly
distributed along its axis.
So it just can't use the same
mechanisms to align itself.
So in 2020, the editor-in-chief
of "The American Journal of Physics"
decided to figure it out.
- I was surprised at how
many bad explanations
that were easy to debunk got published.
When you think about it,
it doesn't make any sense,
because the air resistance
would push the nose of the football up,
and you want the nose of
the football to go down.
So it's pretty curious.
- [Henry] So Price put
together a theoretical model
to explain the football's turnover.
And today, we're gonna see
whether his findings hold up
by simulating Tom Brady's own throws
in a wind tunnel.
- The idea of having anything
to do with Tom Brady,
whom I greatly respect,
not only because of his skill,
but because of his work ethic.
It's otherworldly.
(dynamic music)
- We have these sensors in these balls.
So we should be able to see
how fast the balls are actually
going from inside the ball.
And just to be sure,
I'm measuring the speed of these balls
the old-fashioned way,
a decision I might regret.
- Do you wanna go right on the side
of the dummy with the gun?
I'll throw it right over your head.
(Derek laughing)
I won't hit you, trust me.
(dynamic music)
Yeah, right there, perfect.
Ready?
- Yep.
45.
- Maybe scoot just a smidge more that way.
Perfect.
- Holy (bleep).
46.
You gonna do another one?
- Yeah.
(dynamic music)
(football whizzing)
- 49.
My God, that's scary.
That's like 80 kilometers an hour.
But would you actually
use that speed in a game?
- That'd be a good speed.
That's a normal pass.
- That's like terrifying.
(upbeat music)
And that's just for a regular throw.
For his long throws,
the speed jumps even higher,
over 60 miles per hour,
that's almost 100 kilometers per hour.
Now, I'm not about to step
in front of that cannon.
I was not built for being an athlete.
- You're built for
analyzing the. (laughing)
- That's right, I'm here for the data.
And that's why I've got Henry here.
- Ooh.
- Ooh, that one hurt the chest.
I heard that.
- Sure you don't wanna
swap in, Derek? (laughing)
- You're doing great.
(dynamic music)
When Tom Brady is throwing,
you gotta react fast.
But that kind of pressure
isn't limited to the football field.
- Now, the internet's a lot like football.
When you're online,
threats are coming at you from all sides.
Now, you got hackers, you got trackers,
you got ads for things
you never even googled.
- And you don't even
have to be near someone
to mess with them.
- (laughing) That was close. (laughing)

And now, back to Tom Brady.
Have people shot you in really slow motion
for the release and everything?
Did you ever watch that back?
- Never.
- [Derek] You guys ready?
- I'm ready.
- [Ricky] Three, two, one.
- Oh my God.
Are you good? You good, Ricky?
- [Ricky] Yeah, yeah, I'm good, I'm good.
- [Henry] Is that plexy
or is that real glass?
- That's plexiglass.
- That's incredible.
- You get one shot at these things.
- Oh (bleep), all right,
I'd have given it my best.
Should we try one more,
even if the camera breaks?
(Henry and Derek laughing)
- [Ricky] I don't see the cracks-
- Wow.
- so we can go again.
- Let's try one more.
- Are you kidding?
- Let me just throw a little harder.
- All right, let's go again.
- I'm gonna throw a little harder.
(football smacking)
- [Ricky] Aw.
- Now we're broke down.
- That went right there.
Are we able to watch the throw back?
- Good spiral.
(laughing) Oh, that's so cool.
- The sensors show Brady's
maximum spin rate on this day
was 628 revolutions per minute.
So armed with this data,
let's analyze Brady's
throws in a wind tunnel.
How much data are you used to getting?
- Zero.
- Really?
- When I played?
- Yeah.
- None of it was available.
(dynamic music)
- [Phillip] So this is
the low-speed wind tunnel
here at the university.
This wind tunnel facility
can get up to about Mach .2,
so 20% of the speed of sound.
- [Derek] Typically this wind tunnel
is used in the development
of advanced wing geometries
for innovative sustainable
aircraft design.
But today, it's being used for football.
- We have just a sting mount
mounted to a turntable.
We actually have a
six-component load cell here.
And with this six-component load cell,
we can measure all three
components of force and torque.
We then have an electric motor, right,
that we can spin to basically
simulate the spiral.
- [Derek] First, we're gonna
simulate one of Brady's throws
where the ball travels
straight into the airflow
with his classic spiral.
(inquisitive music)
And everything proceeds as we expect,
no significant forces or torques develop.
But during a game,
a ball doesn't travel like this
in a straight line.
During any throw,
its center of mass follows a
roughly parabolic trajectory.
So let's say you align the ball
perfectly with this
parabola when you launch it.
Well, then, from the ball's perspective,
just a moment later, this
parabola starts to curve down
away from the ball,
which means more air
will be hitting the underside
of the ball than on top.
Now, you would expect this
would tilt the ball back,
but that's only what happens
if the ball is not spinning.
If it is spinning,
then the situation is very different,
which you can see with this amazing demo.
Imagine this ring of golf balls
is like a cross-sectional
slice of the football.
- Here's what happens when
I try and push it back
with this leaf blower.
(leaf blower blowing)
I mean, it tilts back
just like you'd expect.
But if I do the exact same thing,
but this time, get the wheel spinning,
tilts out to the right.
And you can see why if we slow it down.
So as the ring passes the leaf bar,
that's where the force is applied.
But each ball still has momentum
in the direction of rotation.
So it actually reaches its peak
90 degrees further along
from where the force is applied,
and this is known as
gyroscopic procession.
- So if the wind was hitting it,
it's gonna keep the point up.
- So you'd think that it
would just push it back.
- Right?
- But because it's spinning,
when you push up,
it actually tilts to the right.
- Oh, interesting.
- But it doesn't stop there.
As the ball tilts right,
it exposes more area on that side.
So now, because of gyroscopic procession,
the ball pitches downward.
And with more air hitting
the top of the ball,
well, it's going to deflect to the left.
And that is going to make
the ball deflect back up.
And now we're back to where we started.
So this cycle is going to repeat,
but since this is happening continuously,
the nose traces out a circle
around the direction of airflow.
So we get a slow wobble.
- We used to joke, whenever
you would not throw
a tight spiral,
you would call it a tight wobbler.
That was a Brett Favre-coined phrase.
He let it go and have
a little wobble to it,
and he'd go, "Oh, tight wobbler."
(Henry laughing)
- Now, if the ball were
just traveling straight,
this would be the whole story.
But remember from before,
the ball's path is a parabola,
meaning that from the ball's perspective,
the oncoming air is constantly
dipping down away from it.
So the ball is trying to process
around the airflow direction,
but that direction is constantly changing.
(light music)
For example, by the time
the ball has reached
the bottom of the procession,
the airflow has moved down too.
And what that means is the ball
is not gonna tilt out to the left
as much as you'd expect.
So when it processes back up,
it doesn't go as high as where it started.
And over time, it is this
that gradually pitches
the nose of the football down,
keeping it aligned with
its parabolic path.
- I can visualize it all,
your fancy science words.
- Okay, okay.
- I'm going all the way back
to my high school days.
I was a very average science student, so.
But you're teaching me a lot.
- As the ball goes through the air,
there's gonna be more air resistance
on the bottom of the ball than on the top.
- The front of the ball, not the back,
'cause that's hitting the wind first.
- The front bottom of the ball.
- Okay.
- And so what that means is,
it creates this processive
effect that pushes it out,
pushes it down, pushes it right.
It creates a wobble no matter what you do.
- Very cool.
- So wobble is actually
not only impossible to avoid,
but it's essential to make sure
that the ball follows the path
that you want it to follow.
- [Derek] You can see
this in the wind tunnel.
We've tilted the ball up by three degrees
and it's free to pivot in any direction.
- Yeah, you're definitely seeing a pitch.
Oh, that's awesome.
What we're seeing is,
it's starting out aligning itself
about three degrees off.
You know, 'cause that's how we spin it up.
But as the airflow starts,
it's pointing itself in the
direction that minimizes drag.
That's so cool.
I mean, that's exactly
what we were expecting,
but it's still incredible
to see it in person.
(inquisitive music)
- [Derek] If you look at
a real football flight,
you'll notice that it spends more time
angled slightly to the right
when thrown by a right hander.
That is what creates the force,
which, through procession,
gradually pitches the nose downward.
It creates the turnover effect
that Tom Brady was talking about.
- Just wanna reframe the wobble
as not necessarily a bad thing.
- Okay, good.
- (laughing) Yeah.
- Peyton Manning had a
good wobble on the balls,
but he found a way to complete
a lot of touchdowns that way.
(inquisitive music)
- [Derek] But the
right-ward lean of the ball
also has an unintended side effect.
Something we've heard
is that for right-handed throwers,
the ball will drift right,
and for left-handed throwers,
the ball will drift left.
Do you think that's true
or is that something you notice?
- So I wouldn't necessarily
agree with that.
- So we got Tom to throw
straight down one of
the lines on the field.
Is the drone set?
That's a pretty straight throw.
- [Tom] Henry, don't move,
you're making it look bad.
(Derek laughing)
- I'll stay planted.
- The more still you go,
the better it looks for my throw.
It's like a catcher.
when you frame the pitch.
- [Henry] I'll frame it,
I'll frame it. (laughing)
(bright music)
- From ground level,
his passes looked amazingly straight.
But from the drone, if you watch closely,
just at the end of the pass,
the ball does drift off to the right.
This is because up until now,
we've been ignoring a very
important aerodynamic effect,
which is lift.
When the ball is tilted to the right,
it generates lift out in that direction.
The more it's tilted,
the larger this force is.
The rightward tilt is required
to get the ball to turn over
during its parabolic path.
But it does mean that right-handed throws
tend to drift, right?
The effect is subtle,
but some players notice it intuitively.
In the fall of 1991, Jerry Rice,
generally considered the
greatest wide receiver
of all time,
changed quarterbacks.
In place of the right-handed Joe Montana,
he was now catching passes
from the left-handed Steve Young.
And for Rice, something felt off.
He wasn't sure exactly why,
but he said the throws
were coming up short.
Of course, what was actually happening
was that the ball was drifting away
from where he expected it to be.
Joe Montana's right-handed throws
drifted to the right,
whereas Steve Young's drifted left.
It's a subtle effect,
but it's all part of the procession
that minimizes drag on the ball
and lets it fly farther,
faster and more accurately.
- So it's not because
you're a bad quarterback
throwing it with a wobble,
it's because wind, you know?
- Okay, so what if you're in
a dome and there's no wind?
- See, that's a great question.
So I'm just saying this
is just air resistance.
So even in a dome, the
same thing would happen.
- Whether in an outdoor
stadium or a closed-top dome,
the ball will always wobble.
But outdoor stadiums are
significantly harder to throw in
because of the wind.
With the ball being thrown
at 50 to 60 miles per hour,
most of the airflow over the ball
is due to its own motion,
but in winds gusting
over 15 miles per hour,
the weather starts to play a major role.
We commissioned the NFL data team
to do an analysis of completion percentage
in outdoor stadiums versus indoor domes.
And they found that
throws in indoor stadiums
are consistently more accurate,
no matter the distance.
So maybe Brady was hard
done by Foxborough,
New England's stadium.
Do you prefer to throw in
a game when it's no wind?
Do you prefer wind, rain, snow?
Does it matter?
- I preferred outdoor, 70 degrees, humid,
tiny little breeze, just to keep you cool.
- Right, but why did
you like being outdoors
as opposed to being in a dome?
- I felt like my depth perception
was a little better outside.
I liked just the natural
feel of the natural air.
The dome always felt like a vacuum.
- Do you think you had an edge
if the weather was bad
compared to other quarterbacks?
- I would say yes.
And the reason why is
I'd say I practiced in it
all the time.
And I think getting used to the conditions
and the familiarity of the wind,
of the humidity, of the rain,
of the snow, you know,
grass field, turf field,
I knew exactly what to wear
for every single condition.
I played 23 seasons, 100
to 120 practices a year.
- You saw everything.
- So that's over
2,000 plus practices.
- That's crazy.
- You know the thickness
you want your sleeves,
you go, okay, "What's the temperature?
It's 50 degrees.
Okay, this is the shirt I
wear when it's 50 degrees.
Oh, it's 35 degrees,
this is the two shirts I wear
when it's 35 degrees.
You know, this is the muff that I wear.
You know, this is how many
heat packs I put in the muff
to keep my hand warm when it's 30 degrees
versus 50 degrees."
- You had it all dialed in.
- You just have to, I mean,
you just observe over time,
and you, you know, get better and better.
It's a lot like an F1 car.
You know, everything is just fractions
of, you know, things to do
to make yourself feel
the most comfortable.
- So maybe Brady is a bit more scientific
than he gives himself credit for.
Over 383 career games,
more than 7,700 completed passes
and tens of thousands
of hours on the field,
Brady intuitively
understands all the physics
we've just analyzed.
Plus he knows how to harness these effects
to get the ball where he wants it to go
with just a few seconds to throw it.
In a game where perfection is impossible,
he's internalized all the complex physics,
the kinematics, the aerodynamics,
and he still makes it look simple.
- Yeah, I don't have to move. (laughing)
So we actually made a video
together with Tom Brady
teaching us how to throw a football.
And if you wanna learn more about that,
you can check it out right here.

- Now what we got for you
are some balls that you've
never thrown before.
- Oh God, what have
you guys got cooked up?
- But we're not done yet.
- What the heck?
In other sports, surfaces are engineered
down to the smallest
detail to control airflow.
But footballs, they've
hardly changed in decades.
So we tested whether a football's
design is really optimal.
And to find out,
we had Tom Brady through
a series of custom balls,
including one built to
eliminate his spin entirely.
- I don't even know how
you could throw that.
- Now, in investigating this,
we actually uncovered a secret technique
that teams are using to modify their balls
and give their players an advantage.
But we'll get to that in a future video.
So make sure to subscribe
and stay notified,
and we'll see you then.
- That's insane.
