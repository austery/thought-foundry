- Imagine you are an astronaut
out drifting in deep space
when you throw a rock as hard as you can.
What's gonna happen to that rock?
Well, you would think
that it would continue
with constant velocity in a straight line.
That's just Newton's first law.
But what actually happens
is it eventually slows down
and stops.
So why does this happen?
Where did all the rock's energy go?
(pensive orchestral music)
At the turn of the 20th century,
the problem of energy conservation
baffled some of the greatest minds,
including Albert Einstein.
Einstein came up with a possible solution,
but then a little-known
unpaid mathematician
named Emmy Noether proved he was wrong.
And in doing so,
she created a whole new
paradigm for physics,
one that underlies all of particle physics
and explains why anything is conserved.
(gentle inquisitive music)
It all started in 1915 at
the University of Gottingen,
where Einstein was giving six lectures
on his new theory of gravity.
What would become the
general theory of relativity.
The lectures were well received,
but Einstein hadn't yet
settled on the final form
of the field equations.
One problem he was facing
was how to show that
total energy was conserved
in his new theory.
- And this is the whole
beginning of this story, right?
Classically, they thought
they had this understanding
of what the energy of the
gravitational field was.
All of a sudden with these new equations,
they go, "Where is it?
You know, is it in the curvature?
You know, is it in the
stress-energy tensor?
Where's the term that we're looking for?"
- [Derek] Einstein
suggested that the principle
of conservation of energy,
long established as a bedrock of physics,
might hold the key to working out
the correct field equations.
In the audience, legendary mathematician
David Hilbert was intrigued.
So he started to look for the
energy conservation equations
in Einstein's new theory,
but the best he could find
was a set of equations known
as the Bianchi identities.
They showed that energy was conserved,
but only in a completely empty universe.
So for one like ours filled
with stuff, they seemed useless.
Hilbert was stumped.
- Fortunately, he knew just
the person for the job.
His new assistant, Emmy Noether.
(light thoughtful music)
- [Derek] From an early
age, Noether had dreamed
of following the footsteps of her father,
a mathematics professor at
the University of Erlangen.
She got special permission
to attend lectures at the university,
but they refused to admit
her as an official student.
The Erlangen Academic Senate
held that the admission of women
"would overthrow all academic order."
(lively orchestral music)
So in 1903, she spent a
semester at Gottingen instead.
There she learned about a
new way to approach geometry
using symmetry.
(gentle thoughtful music)
Symmetry is one of those
ideas that's easy to recognize
but harder to describe.
- If I align a mirror on
this triangle like so,
then it looks the same
as without the mirror,
and that's because this
is an axis of symmetry.
The reflections about this axis
leave the triangle unchanged.
And the same thing happens
if I put the mirror like this
or if I orient the mirror like this.
So this triangle has
three axes of symmetry.
Now, mathematicians generalize
the idea of symmetry further
to be any action you can take
that leaves an object unchanged.
So something else I could do
is I could rotate this triangle
by 120 degrees or by 240 degrees
or by 360 degrees.
Together, these six actions
capture all the symmetries
of the equilateral triangle.
- [Derek] But you can also
have more abstract symmetries,
for example, with a mathematical function.
If I shift this function up or
down by some constant amount,
call it a, then all of
its y values will change.
But if I differentiate that
function, I get the slope,
and that remains unchanged
regardless of whatever constant is added.
So you can add any
constant to this function,
and its derivative always stays the same.
So there is a kind of
translation symmetry.
And unlike the symmetries of the triangle,
this is a continuous symmetry,
meaning you can shift it
by any amount you like.
Over the next 12 years,
Noether became a leading
expert on symmetry.
She became only the
second woman in Germany
to earn a PhD in mathematics,
and she used this
expertise to help Hilbert
and Einstein with their
problem of energy conservation.
The issue had bothered Einstein so much
that he proposed a new
conservation equation.
It said that if we add
together the energy of matter
and the energy of the gravitational field,
then that total remains constant.
Its change over time and space is zero.
But when Noether saw this,
she was convinced Einstein
had made a fundamental mistake
because this equation disregards
the foundational principle
that general relativity is built on.
(light pensive music)
10 years earlier, in 1905,
Einstein had introduced his
special theory of relativity,
and it was built on the idea
that the laws of physics
were independent of
your frame of reference.
But so far Einstein had
only applied this principle
to inertial frames of reference.
Those are frames that
move at a constant speed.
- He began wondering
what would it take to generalize that,
to consider more general states of motion.
After all, trains on the
platform; he loved trains.
Trains would speed up or slow down.
People, you know, moving around the world
don't only move at a single
constant speed forever.
- In 1907, he wrote,
"Is it conceivable that
the principle of relativity
also applies to systems
that are accelerated
relative to each other?"
This made him wonder;
perhaps his principle could
also be applied to accelerating
and rotating frames, frames
that move in any way in general.
That's the "general"
in general relativity.
So Einstein got to work
on this largely intellectual pursuit.
- But then, as he was
daydreaming in the patent office,
he had what he called the
happiest thought of his life.
- [Derek] He imagined the window cleaner
at the top of the opposite
building falling off.
(window cleaner screams)
And Einstein realized that
while the man was falling,
he wouldn't feel his own weight.
He would be weightless,
and anything he dropped on his way down
would remain stationary relative to him.
It would be just as if he
was floating in outer space.
- It's ironic, we would've said,
"Oh, he's being pulled down to the ground
because the gravity of the
Earth is exerting a force.
But Einstein said, while
that person is in motion,
what we call free fall motion,
they would actually
feel no gravity at all.
There must be some equivalence
between accelerated motion
and the action of gravity.
So Einstein arrived
at what he called the
equivalence principle.
- [Derek] If you were stuck
in a rocket in outer space
accelerating at 9.8
meters per second squared,
then it would be the exact same
as if you were standing
on the surface of Earth.
- And this was huge
because it meant that if
Einstein could figure out
how to understand accelerating frames,
then he didn't just get
a more general theory;
he would also have a
new theory of gravity.
- But to achieve this,
Einstein needed to make
sure the laws of gravity
had the same form in
every frame of reference.
(train whooshing)
This is the idea of general covariance,
and it's one of the core
tenets of general relativity.
To satisfy it, Einstein knew he had to use
special mathematical
objects called tensors.
A simple kind of tensor is a vector.
You can write a vector
as a set of components
multiplied by their basis vectors.
For example, this vector can be written as
3x hat plus 2y hat.
But I can also write this
using a different coordinate system.
And with these new basis vectors,
the original vector is
now written as 2a plus 1b.
So the components, the
numbers in this list, changed,
but the vector didn't.
It stayed the same.
And that's because when
the basis vectors change,
the components adjust
in a complementary way
to keep the vector the same.
The vector itself is independent
of which coordinate system you use.
And the same is true for tensors,
only now instead of having
just two components,
a general tensor can
have any number of them
in the form of a matrix.
And just like with vectors,
you can change a tensor
from one coordinate system to another,
and the tensor stays the same.
So that's why Einstein had to use them
to build his new theory.
- And that was exactly the
problem that Noether found
because when she looked
at Einstein's proposed
energy conservation equation,
it contained a pseudotensor.
And as the name implies,
that isn't quite a tensor.
When you try to transform it
from one frame of reference to another,
it doesn't remain the same
quantity in different frames.
The gravitational energy you
might observe in one frame
completely disappears in another.
- And Einstein, you know,
he had some strange thoughts about this.
I mean, people were trying to
stamp conservation of energy
into relativity by bending the rules
of mathematics.
- So, Noether knew that
Einstein's proposed solution
couldn't be the answer,
and that made her think,
"What if general covariance
and energy conservation
are simply incompatible?
And if that's the case, then why?"
General covariance says
that laws of physics
must stay the same when you
change reference frames.
So that is a kind of symmetry,
exactly what Noether had
spent her career studying.
So she started thinking
about the symmetries of the universe,
beginning with the simplest possible case,
an empty static universe.
(light contemplative music)
Imagine you are an
astronaut in this universe.
Since it's empty, there is nothing special
about any particular point.
I mean, it doesn't matter if
you're over here or over there;
the universe is completely symmetric
under translations in space.
So suppose you throw a ball;
well, it'll travel at a given speed,
and after a short amount of time,
it will have traveled some distance.
But since the laws of
physics are the same here
as just before, we can
shift the whole universe,
and we're back to the
situation we started with.
And we can keep doing this over and over,
and this shows us that
the object will continue
with that same speed indefinitely.
So what we've discovered
is that the principle of
conservation of momentum
is a direct result
of the fact that there's
a translation symmetry
in the universe, that an
experiment done in one spot
will give identical results
to that same experiment
done somewhere else.
You could move everything
from one place to another,
and the physics won't change.
Similarly, the laws of
physics don't depend
on whether you perform
an experiment like this
or rotate everything by 90 degrees.
This universe is
symmetric under rotations.
So imagine we take a
metal rod and spin it.
If we let it rotate for a minute,
then it will have moved
through a small angle,
but we can rotate the whole universe back
by that same angle
and now we're at the
starting position again.
And we can keep doing this
so that each instant
looks exactly the same
as the one before, which means the object
will keep rotating this way indefinitely.
So the law of conservation
of angular momentum
comes from the rotational
symmetry of the universe.
Now, another important
symmetry of this universe
is time symmetry.
The laws of physics
don't change over time;
if you do an experiment today or tomorrow,
you will get the same result.
So what does this symmetry lead to?
Well, to understand this,
we're gonna dig into some math
and a different way of doing mechanics
using the principle of least action.
Previously on Veritasium,
we learned that everything
always follows the path
that minimizes a quantity
known as the action.
This is equivalent to the integral
of the Lagrangian L over time.
In the simplest case,
that's just the kinetic
minus potential energy.
Euler and Lagrange found
that the principle of
least action is obeyed,
so long as this set of differential
equations is satisfied.
So Noether used action to see how physics
was affected by different symmetries.
- So suppose we do an experiment
where the result is the same now
as some tiny time interval epsilon later,
then how does this affect the action?
Well, the time is going
to change from just t
to t plus epsilon,
and as a result, the Lagrangian
is also going to change.
So the new Lagrangian will be L prime,
which is equal to the old Lagrangian,
plus how much the Lagrangian
changes over time,
that's just dL by dt,
multiplied by how long that change lasts,
so multiplied by epsilon.
But now also remember that the result
is gonna be the exact same
now as a little while later,
which means that whatever this term is,
the dL over dt, doesn't affect
the equations of motion,
and it's from this symmetry in the action
that we're gonna be able to
find the conserved quantity.
So let's take dL/dt and rewrite
it using the chain rule.
That gives us the partial
derivative of L with respect to X
times dx over dt,
plus the partial derivative
of L with respect to v
times dv over dt.
But we can sub in the
partial derivative of L
with respect to x
with this term from the
Euler-Lagrange equation.
And we can simplify this further
by writing dx over dt as v,
and that gives us this expression.
And now notice what we've got right here.
We've got the time derivative
of some function, dL over dv,
times another function,
plus that first function
times the time derivative
of the second function.
So we can use the reverse
of the product rule
to simplify this to the time
derivative of dL over dv
times v.
Then as a final step, we can
bring dL over dt to the right.
So what we found is that
if you take the time
derivative of this quantity,
it's equal to zero,
which means that whatever
this is has to be a constant.
So what is it?
Well, remember that in the
simplest case, the Lagrangian
is just equal to the kinetic
minus potential energy,
which we can write as
1/2 mv squared minus v.
So if we take the partial
derivative of the Lagrangian
with respect to v, we're
just gonna get d over dt,
m times v multiplied by v,
so this is gonna become mv squared.
And then we can sub in the Lagrangian.
So this becomes minus
1/2 mv squared minus v,
but also minus here.
So this becomes plus v, and
all of that's equal to zero,
which we can simplify
to just 1/2 mv squared
plus v is equal to zero.
But wait a second because
this is just the total energy.
So what we've discovered is
that time translation symmetry
is equivalent to saying
that energy is conserved.
(dramatic orchestral music)
- The principle of conservation of energy
is a direct consequence of
time translation symmetry.
In a theorem, Noether proved
that all of these examples
are no coincidence.
For centuries, people had no idea
where conservation laws came from.
But now Noether had discovered
the origin of all of them.
She proved that anytime you
have a continuous symmetry,
you get a corresponding conservation law.
Translational symmetry gives
you conservation of momentum,
rotational symmetry gives you
conservation of angular momentum,
and time translation symmetry
gives you conservation of energy.
But these are all symmetries
of a static empty universe.
The universe we live in is very different.
In the 1920s, astronomers
measured the velocities
of distant galaxies,
and they realized all of
them are moving away from us.
The farther away they are,
the faster they're moving.
The implication was clear.
In the distant past,
everything must have been
much closer together.
In the 1990s, precise
measurements of supernovae
revealed that not only was
the universe expanding,
but that expansion was speeding up.
This means over large timescales,
our universe is not symmetric in time.
It was very different
13 billion years ago,
and it'll be different
billions of years from now.
Since we don't have time symmetry,
that also means energy,
as we usually think of it,
isn't conserved.
- There's no reason for
energy to be conserved anymore
'cause you don't have that symmetry.
- [Derek] Think about a
photon of visible light
emitted 380,000 years after the Big Bang,
it travels through the universe unimpeded
to arrive at our telescopes,
not as visible light but as a microwave.
It has lost 99.9% of its energy.
- Where did the energy go?
Doesn't go anywhere.
Energy's not conserved.
- [Derek] And this is exactly
what's happening to the rock as well.
It starts off with energy,
but as it travels through
the expanding universe,
it slows down and stops.
(gentle thoughtful music)
The energy doesn't really go
anywhere; it just disappears.
- It ends up coming to rest
with regard to the other
particles in the universe.
- This doesn't violate any laws of physics
because energy and
momentum aren't conserved
if there is no time or spatial symmetry.
- So once you know that
symmetries give you conservation laws,
and so once those symmetries are gone,
you don't have to worry about
those conservation laws anymore,
then you can start dropping these concepts
of trying to force something
that you want to say is
fundamental into the theory,
and you just deal with
what the theory gives you.
- But if energy isn't
conserved in our universe,
then why does it usually seem like it is?
(light mysterious music)
That's because when you're
looking at the short timescales
that we're used to,
time translation symmetry
pretty much holds;
an experiment done today
will give the same results
as the same experiment done tomorrow.
So that means for all
intents and purposes,
energy is conserved.
But over large timescales on
the order of millions of years,
well, then the expansion of the
universe can't be neglected,
and the symmetry is broken.
So only when you look
at timescales that big
do you notice that energy isn't conserved.
Noether's first theorem
explains why a rock
or a photon loses energy,
but it didn't fully solve the problem
of energy conservation
in general relativity.
See, so far, Noether had only
dealt with an empty universe
where you could shift the whole universe
and the laws of physics
would stay the same.
But this doesn't work
in general relativity,
where the curvature can change
from one point to another.
Now if you shift the whole universe,
rotate it, or let it evolve in time,
things don't stay exactly the same.
So you no longer have
these global symmetries,
but Noether realized there are
still other symmetries left.
See, no matter how you're moving,
the laws of physics always look the same.
That's general covariance,
and it is a kind of symmetry
that holds everywhere.
It means that in any small region,
we can always change
our frame of reference.
We can transform the
points of space around
as much as we like.
And since these transformations
aren't global but local,
these are called local symmetries.
In a second theorem,
Noether proved that for
these local symmetries,
you no longer get proper conservation laws
like we're used to in classical physics.
Instead, you get something
that only works locally:
a continuity equation.
One example of a continuity equation
describes the flow of
water through a pipe.
This first term tells you how
the amount of water changes
in a section of the pipe,
and the second tells you the difference
between how much water is flowing out
and how much is flowing in.
In this case, the first term is positive
because the water level in this
pipe section is increasing,
and the second term will be negative
because less water is flowing
out of the section than in.
Together, the two terms
cancel to give zero,
which guarantees that no
water is created or destroyed.
If the total amount of
water changes in a section,
there must either be excess
water flowing in or out.
- In the case of general relativity,
Noether found a similar
continuity equation,
but with an important difference.
Imagine that now our pipes are
little patches of space-time,
and the water is energy flowing
from one patch to another.
In any individual section,
the continuity equation looks
exactly the same as before,
so that in any small region of space-time,
energy is conserved.
But when we link these sections together,
we need to take into account
the curvature of space-time.
And this changes the equation.
Now, it's as if there are
little cracks appearing
between different sections of pipe,
between the local patches of space-time,
and through those cracks,
energy can leak out.
- In special activity,
the pipe is imperturbable
because the pipe is fixed.
And in general activity, you know,
we have to account for the energy
that goes into other
kinds of change over time,
and that gets correspondingly more tricky.
- [Derek] Now that we
have this new equation,
we can see how it works
by expanding it as a
sum of different terms.
This first term is analogous
to the continuity equation from before,
the one which conserves energy
within a local patch of space-time.
But now we have all these extra terms.
These describe the
curvature of space-time.
So as energy decreases in the first term,
these curvature terms increase.
- The energy that you lose from
the system you're tracking,
we now start attributing it to things like
the gravitational field,
which has changed 'cause the
whole universe is stretched.
We have to account for the energy
that we attribute to the action
of the gravitational field as well
because space and time
themselves aren't sitting still.
- And all of this can be described
by the continuity equation
Noether had found.
But when she looked at it,
she realized something.
It was exactly equivalent
to the Bianchi identities,
the half-solution Hilbert had found.
He had dismissed it
because it only gave you
proper energy conservation
in an empty universe.
But now Noether proved that
it was the best you could do
in general relativity.
With one paper, she had
uncovered the source
of all conservation laws, and
she had solved the problem
in general relativity that
eluded Hilbert and Einstein.
- She was so amazing.
I mean, I would go out on a limb,
and I would say these
two theorems are probably
the most important theorems for
physics of the 20th century.
- [Derek] In the following years,
the University of Gottingen
took steps to make Noether's
position more official,
allowing her to do what
she loved most: to teach.
They made her a professor,
and she even got a small
salary starting in 1923.
But all of that changed on
the 30th of January, 1933,
when Hitler became chancellor of Germany.
The Nazis banned Jewish people
from working at universities,
and almost immediately,
one of her former students
told the authorities
of her Jewish heritage,
and she was suspended.
Despite this dismissal,
she continued teaching in
the kitchen of her home.
Then one day, one of her old
students knocked on her door.
(hand knocking on door)
Clothed in the brown shirt
of the Nazi stormtroopers,
Noether let him in.
He had come to learn math,
and Noether was happy to teach him.
- I love what this sort
of shows about Noether.
You know, she truly,
deeply cared about math,
and she wouldn't discriminate.
Whether someone was wearing
a Nazi shirt or not;
she taught all.
- [Derek] But staying in
Germany became untenable.
Fortunately, with the
help of other academics,
she managed to obtain a
teaching position at Bryn Mawr,
a woman's college in America,
where she would teach until her death.
In an obituary for the New York Times,
Einstein wrote that "Fraulein Noether
was the most significant
creative mathematical genius
thus far produced
since the higher
education of women began."
- The reason that Noether's
theorem is so important
is that everybody just
changed their state of mind.
All of a sudden, the physicists
were thinking about physics
in terms of these symmetries.
- Physicists started applying these ideas
to the quantum world too,
realizing that charged particles
like electrons also have symmetries.
Electrons have a phase,
which you can think of
as an arrow pointing in some direction,
but you can offset this
phase by any arbitrary amount
so long as you do it
simultaneously for all electrons.
And that doesn't change
anything physically,
so there's another symmetry.
So what does this offset
or gauge symmetry lead to?
Well, it leads to the
conservation of electric charge.
In the 1960s and '70s,
Noether's insights led
directly to the discovery
of new fundamental particles
like quarks and the Higgs boson.
It taught us where the
forces of nature come from,
and it even helped to explain
the origin of all mass
in the universe.
Noether's two theorems,
although little known,
are what has gotten us the
closest we've ever come
to a theory of everything.
But all of this and much more
will be covered in a second video.

When Emmy Noether set
out to study mathematics,
she was following in
her father's footsteps,
but from there she forged her own path.
And before long, she was
coming up with a whole theory
that reshaped our
understanding of the universe.
That is the great thing about learning.
You start by following instructions,
building on what others
have done before you.
But then at some point, you
start asking your own questions;
you start experimenting
and making discoveries.
I've loved watching my own
kids start this journey,
and my longtime sponsor, KiwiCo,
has been a big part of it.
This month they sent me their
Rapid-Fire Disc Launcher crate,
and at first, we followed
the instructions carefully,
putting it together step by step.
But as soon as it was built,
my kids immediately started experimenting.
- [Child] Can I launch it?
- Testing different launch techniques
to better hit the target,
changing the launch angles,
and figuring out what would
make the discs fly farther.
Without even realizing it,
they were engaging with the
same questioning mindset
that drives real scientific discoveries.
So who knows, maybe a simple disc launcher
will inspire a young scientist
who will go on to make the
next great breakthrough
in science or engineering.
KiwiCo makes this easy
by delivering everything
you need in a single box,
and they have projects for all ages
designed by experts and tested by kids
