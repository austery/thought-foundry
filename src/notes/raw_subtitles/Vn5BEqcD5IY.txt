Hello
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 September


20th
 and
 this
 is
 Markets
 Weekly.
 So
 this


past
 week
 was
 an
 absolutely
 ebulent
 week


in
 markets.
 We
 had
 all-time
 highs
 in
 all


the
 major
 indexes
 and
 honestly
 it
 seems


like
 it's
 going
 almost
 parabolic.
 I


think
 I
 believe
 and
 I
 think
 most
 people


do
 that
 this
 is
 obviously
 a
 bubble.
 That


being
 said,
 doesn't
 mean
 it
 can't
 go


higher.
 If
 you're
 bullish,
 you
 can
 say


that,
 you
 know,
 we're
 in
 the
 early


innings
 of
 the
 bubble.
 Maybe
 it
 can


still
 double
 or
 triple.
 And
 if
 you're


bearish,
 you'll
 say
 that
 we
 are
 in
 the


later
 stages
 of
 the
 bubble,
 so
 things


could
 unravel.
 Now,
 it
 seems
 like
 the


approximate
 cause
 of
 uh
 the
 ebulent


asset
 prices
 has
 to
 do
 with
 the
 Fed.
 The


Fed
 is
 cutting,
 telling
 you
 that
 it's


probably
 going
 to
 cut
 two
 more
 times


this
 year.
 And
 you
 know,
 maybe
 you
 can


say
 that
 the
 economy
 is
 going
 to


reacelerate.
 Things
 are
 going
 well.
 Got


to
 buy
 stocks.
 However,
 though,
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 market
 pricing
 uh
 after
 the


Fed
 meeting,
 you'll
 notice
 that
 interest


rates
 along
 the
 curve
 are
 higher,
 right?


got
 the
 10-year
 at
 4
 uh
 1%
 even
 the


2-year
 higher
 by
 several
 basis
 points.


That's
 telling
 you
 that
 the
 mark
 the


bidding
 actually
 wasn't
 doubbish.
 It
 was


hawkish.
 But
 did
 telegraph
 they
 were


cutting
 uh
 but
 they're
 cutting
 less
 than


the
 market
 is
 projecting.
 So
 interest


rates
 rose
 throughout
 the
 curve
 and
 in


line
 with
 that
 the
 dollar
 also


strengthened
 notably
 all
 things
 that
 you


would
 see
 in
 a
 hawkish
 Fed
 meeting.
 And


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 meeting
 that
 day,


you'll
 notice
 that
 stocks
 did
 sell
 off


uh
 almost
 1%
 and
 then
 I
 think
 those


people
 who
 are
 maybe
 probably
 old
 school


macro
 guys
 uh
 then
 got
 totally
 run
 over


uh
 by
 the
 apes
 and
 you
 know
 we
 we've


been
 going
 up
 ever
 since.
 And
 how
 far
 we


go
 I
 guess
 we'll
 find
 out
 in
 the
 coming


weeks.
 One
 other
 thing
 to
 note
 of
 course


is
 that
 last
 week
 was
 a
 quarterly


options
 expiry
 probably
 the
 largest


ever.
 And
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 month,
 we


also
 have
 the
 big
 JP
 Morgan
 trade
 that


everyone
 talks
 about.
 So
 there
 is
 uh
 the


option
 market
 will
 have
 some
 meaningful


impact
 on
 prices
 this
 past
 week
 and
 uh


this
 coming
 week
 as
 well.
 So
 uh
 we'll


see
 how
 that
 affects
 things.
 So
 again,
 a


lot
 of
 things
 happening
 underneath
 the


surface.
 Um
 today,
 let's
 talk
 about
 two


things.
 First
 off,
 let's
 talk
 about
 the


pretty
 interesting
 shift
 by
 the
 Bank
 of


Japan
 and
 that
 it's
 unwinding
 its
 equity


its
 equity
 purchases.
 And
 secondly,


let's
 talk
 about
 the
 president's
 brand


new
 immigration
 policy
 where
 he's


charging
 a
 hefty
 fee
 for
 H-1Bs
 uh
 but


basically
 in
 line
 with
 what
 he's
 been


doing
 throughout
 his
 uh
 tenure
 as
 his


second
 tenure
 as
 president.
 All
 right,


starting
 with
 the
 Bank
 of
 Japan.
 So
 just


to
 level
 set
 a
 little
 bit
 although


throughout
 most
 of
 the
 developed
 world


banks
 central
 banks
 have
 been
 cutting


rates
 in
 the
 US
 and
 Canada
 and
 the
 UK


and
 uh
 in
 Europe
 and
 so
 forth
 because


inflation
 has
 come
 down
 the
 economy
 has


been
 slowing
 in
 Japan.
 Actually
 the
 Bank


of
 Japan
 is
 still
 in
 hiking
 mode.
 That


is
 because
 inflation
 is
 still
 a
 big


problem
 in
 Japan.
 Um,
 inflation
 has
 been


above
 the
 Bank
 of
 Japan's
 targets
 for


for
 some
 time.
 And
 as
 Governor
 Weda


mentioned
 at
 his
 speech
 at
 Jackson
 Hole,


he
 thinks
 that
 an
 aging
 population
 is


inflationary.
 So
 this
 higher
 inflation


is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 secular
 problem
 that


Japan
 is
 going
 to
 face.
 At
 the
 Bank
 of


Japan
 meeting
 the
 past
 week,
 there
 was


no
 rate
 hike,
 but
 he
 did
 get
 a
 couple


descents.
 So
 the
 market
 is
 widely


expecting
 the
 Bank
 of
 Japan
 to
 hike
 uh


very
 soon.
 And
 that's
 can
 you
 can
 see


that
 in
 the
 price
 as
 well.
 Some
 one


other
 thing
 that
 they
 did
 was
 that
 was


very
 interesting
 is
 that
 they
 began
 to


unwind
 their
 purchase
 of
 stocks.
 So
 as


we
 all
 know
 Japan
 suffered
 from


disinflation
 deflation
 for
 many
 decades.


And
 so
 the
 bank
 of
 Japan
 began
 many
 was


many
 aggressive
 experiments
 to
 try
 to


you
 know
 boost
 inflation.
 Uh
 they
 bought


a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 uh
 JGBs
 even
 rolled
 out


yield
 curve
 control.
 Interestingly,
 it


was
 not
 to
 keep
 yields
 lower.
 It
 was


because
 the
 yields
 were
 too
 low
 and
 they


had
 to
 roll
 out
 yield
 control
 to
 keep


yields
 higher.
 So,
 they
 did
 all
 this


interesting
 stuff.
 Didn't
 seem
 to
 work.


And
 so,
 they
 ended
 up
 buying
 stocks


trying
 to
 have
 maybe
 a
 wealth
 effect.


This
 started
 about
 a
 decade
 ago.
 And
 uh


in
 the
 beginning,
 it
 was
 actually
 quite


aggressive.
 And
 so,
 when
 the
 Bank
 of


Japan
 began
 buying
 stocks,
 stock
 market


there
 roared,
 but
 it
 didn't
 last.
 The


way
 they
 did
 this
 is
 they
 bought
 ETFs.


So
 they
 didn't
 want
 to
 be
 seen
 as
 fair


being
 one
 company
 or
 another.
 So
 they


just
 bought
 ETFs,
 basket
 of
 stocks
 uh
 to


try
 to
 be
 more
 equitable.


Now
 if
 you
 look
 at
 their
 holdings
 of


stocks
 right
 now,
 it's
 almost
 half
 a


trillion
 US.
 So
 they
 hold
 a
 ton
 of
 the


Japanese
 stock
 market.


At
 their
 meeting,
 they
 telegraph
 that


they're
 going
 to
 start
 unwinding
 their


purchases.
 Um
 let's
 see,
 by
 how
 much?


Uh,
 looks
 like
 it's
 uh,
 who
 get
 off
 the


chart
 here.


About
 600
 billion
 uh,
 yen,
 Japanese
 yen


a
 year.
 Sounds
 like
 a
 lot,
 but
 when
 you


convert
 it
 to
 dollars,
 it's
 about
 6


billion
 a
 year.
 Uh,
 when
 it
 comes
 to


ETFs
 and
 um,
 5.5
 billion
 a
 year
 in


resale,
 that's
 a
 trivial
 amount.
 So
 if


you
 own
 let's
 say
 you
 know
 half
 a


trillion
 dollars
 worth
 of
 stocks
 and


you're
 only
 selling
 off
 let's
 say
 6


billion
 a
 year
 it's
 going
 to
 take
 you


you
 know
 almost
 a
 hundred
 years
 for
 you


to
 unwind
 um
 all
 your
 stock
 purchases.


So
 this
 is
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 a
 very


trivial
 amount
 that
 they
 are
 unwinding.


However
 if
 you
 look
 at
 their
 stock


market
 though
 it
 was
 impacted
 by
 this


stock
 market
 didn't
 like
 this
 and
 it


would
 down
 on
 the
 news.
 This
 is
 just


again
 to
 show
 you
 that
 stock
 prices
 in


the
 stock
 market
 largely
 psychological


even
 though
 the
 Bank
 of
 Japan
 is
 only


trivially
 unwinding
 their
 purchases.
 Uh


this
 is
 impacting
 investor
 psychology.


But
 what's
 more
 interesting
 though
 is
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 10-year
 JGB
 yield.
 Now


the
 prospect
 of
 further
 hikes
 is
 sending


the
 10-year
 JGB
 yield
 to
 multi-deade


highs.
 Now
 as
 we
 know
 the
 bond
 market
 is


internationally
 collected.
 So
 if
 yields


in
 Japan
 continue
 to
 rise,
 that's
 going


to
 exert
 upward
 pressure
 on
 yields


globally.
 One
 other
 thing
 to
 note
 is


that
 Japanese
 investors
 are
 huge
 huge


global
 investors.
 They
 own
 a
 whole
 bunch


of
 dollar
 assets,
 whole
 bunch
 of
 euro


assets
 and
 so
 forth.
 So
 there's
 a
 line


of
 thinking
 that
 if
 yields
 in
 Japan


become
 more
 attractive,
 you
 know,
 maybe


they
 don't
 have
 to
 go
 so
 far
 into
 the


world
 to
 get
 attractive
 investments.


Maybe
 they
 can
 sell
 some
 of
 their
 dollar


investments,
 some
 of
 their
 euro


investments,
 repatriate
 them,
 and
 just,


you
 know,
 get
 a
 good
 yield
 from
 JGBs.


Now,
 to
 be
 clear,
 that
 doesn't
 seem
 to


be
 happening
 so
 far,
 but
 eventually
 that


could
 happen.
 After
 all,
 the
 Bank
 of


Japan
 is
 on
 a
 hiking
 cycle,
 and
 with


their
 demographics,
 maybe
 they'll


continue
 to
 hike.
 So
 that
 could
 lead
 to


a
 repatriation
 strengthening
 of
 the
 yen


uh
 which
 uh
 could
 be
 at
 the
 expense
 of


foreign
 assets.
 But
 you
 know
 this
 is
 a


slow
 process.
 We'll
 see
 how
 that
 unfolds


going
 forward.
 Now
 the
 second
 thing
 I


want
 to
 talk
 about
 is
 the
 very


interesting
 immigration
 policy
 the


president
 unveiled
 on
 Friday.
 So
 in
 the


US
 if
 you
 are
 a
 company
 you
 want
 to
 hire


a
 foreign
 worker.
 You
 give
 them
 what's


called
 an
 H-1B
 visa.
 And
 H1B
 visas
 are


pretty
 common.
 There
 are
 several
 hundred


thousand
 of
 them.
 To
 get
 an
 H-1B
 visa,


there's
 a
 lottery
 process,
 but
 in
 terms


of
 fees,
 it's
 not
 super
 expensive.
 It's


a
 few
 thousand
 when
 it
 comes
 to


government
 fees
 and
 lawyer
 fees.
 A


president
 announced
 that
 it
 wants
 to


raise
 the
 government
 fee
 uh
 to
 100,000,


which
 is
 of
 course
 a
 huge
 huge
 increase,


but
 this
 is
 in
 line
 with
 what
 the


president
 has
 been
 doing
 his
 entire


year,
 right?
 So
 the
 president
 says
 that


he
 wants
 you
 to
 buy
 products
 made
 in


America,
 stimulate
 American
 production.


So
 he
 puts
 a
 big
 tariff
 on
 imports.
 Now


that
 tariff
 again
 not
 necessarily
 borne


by
 the
 foreign
 exporter,
 but
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 is
 going
 to
 make
 domestic


products
 more
 attractive
 relative
 to


foreign
 products.
 In
 that
 sense,
 he
 is


supporting
 domestic
 production.
 That's


his
 goal,
 right?
 Make
 America
 great


again.
 Now,
 this
 H-1B
 visa
 pro
 process


is
 the
 exact
 same
 thing
 but
 on
 labor.


So,
 he's
 basically
 putting
 a
 tax
 on


foreign
 labor
 to
 make
 it
 more
 attractive


to
 hire
 American
 workers.


Now,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 who
 is
 getting
 all


these
 H-1B
 visas,
 you'll
 see
 that


they're
 largely
 tech
 companies.
 An


interesting
 stat
 that
 I
 read
 was
 that


75%
 of
 H-1B
 visa
 holders
 are
 born
 in


India.
 So
 it's
 largely
 a
 program
 to


import
 Indians
 into
 the
 US
 to
 work
 in
 IT


roles.
 Now
 whether
 or
 not
 this
 is
 good


or
 bad
 really
 depends
 on
 who
 you
 ask.
 So


people
 like
 Elon
 and
 many
 other
 tech


CEOs
 who
 say
 that
 H1Bs
 are
 really


important.
 They
 help
 the
 US
 stay
 in


front
 of
 the
 technological
 uh


competition
 and
 you
 know
 we're
 we're


having
 all
 these
 smart
 people
 who
 work


for
 us.
 That's
 really
 good.
 If
 you
 ask


American
 workers,
 and
 you
 can
 get
 a
 lot


of
 feedback
 from
 this
 from
 in
 the
 forums


and
 so
 forth,
 they'll
 tell
 you
 that


H-1Bs
 are
 just
 a
 way
 for
 tech
 companies


to
 import
 cheap
 foreign
 labor
 so
 they


don't
 have
 to
 pay
 higher
 wages
 to


American
 workers.
 Now,
 uh
 what


technically
 happens
 is
 is
 that
 if
 you


are
 a
 H-1B
 employee
 in
 the
 US,
 you're


kind
 of
 beholden
 to
 your
 employer


because
 you
 can't
 really
 leave
 easily.


And
 so
 that
 gives
 your
 employer
 a
 lot
 of


power.
 Whereas
 if
 you
 were
 an
 American


worker,
 you
 know,
 you
 don't
 don't
 like


what's
 happening,
 you
 can
 go
 to
 another


company.
 And
 so,
 uh,
 the
 the
 thinking
 is


that
 what
 the
 American
 workers
 would
 say


is
 that
 often
 times
 the
 H-1B
 is
 just,


uh,
 a
 way
 to
 to
 keep
 wages
 low
 for
 the


tech
 companies.


So
 I
 think
 what
 what


I
 think
 what
 the
 president
 is
 doing
 here


is
 he's
 trying
 to
 strike
 a
 balance
 where


if
 he
 raised
 the
 fee
 to
 100,000
 then
 you


know
 the
 only
 way
 that
 we
 have
 H1Bs
 is


if
 the
 tech
 companies
 are
 paying
 for


people
 who
 are
 truly
 truly
 exceptional


people
 who
 are
 you
 know
 geniuses
 brewing


people
 who
 are
 going
 to
 come
 and
 just


generate
 a
 lot
 of
 benefits
 for
 them.
 Of


course
 tech
 companies
 are
 flushed
 with


cash
 $100,000
 fee
 is
 nothing.
 So,
 the


very
 best
 people
 will
 continue
 to
 come


to
 the
 United
 States
 through
 the
 H-1B


program.
 However,
 though,
 if
 you
 are


just
 a,
 you
 know,
 a
 general
 entry
 level


tech
 employee,
 uh
 they're
 they're
 not


going
 to
 be
 doing
 that
 anymore.
 And


those
 jobs
 instead
 will
 go
 to
 American


employees.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


employment
 stats
 for
 newly
 graduated


computer
 science
 people
 in
 the
 US,


you'll
 note
 that
 the
 unemployment
 rate


has
 gone
 up.
 And
 so
 many
 many
 people


American
 uh
 computer
 science
 graduates


are
 having
 trouble
 finding
 new
 jobs.
 So


this
 in
 a
 sense
 would
 incentivize
 tech


companies
 to
 hire
 more
 of
 them.


So
 I
 think
 this
 is
 actually
 something


that
 is
 pretty
 smart.
 It's
 basically


monetizing
 problem
 like
 he's
 done
 uh


let's
 say
 for
 for
 Nvidia
 for
 example.


Nvidia
 wants
 to
 sell
 chips
 to
 the
 to


China.
 president
 not
 sure
 about
 this
 but


hey
 why
 don't
 you
 just
 split
 some


revenue
 to
 us
 so
 that
 at least
 the


public
 gets
 some
 benefit
 so
 again
 I


think
 this
 will
 have
 some
 impacts


basically
 attacks
 on
 uh
 people
 who


import
 a
 lot
 of
 foreign
 labor
 so
 not
 too


good
 for
 the
 big
 tech
 companies
 but
 uh


definitely
 good
 for
 American
 employees


which
 I
 think
 was
 the
 president's
 entire


platform
 now
 in
 addition
 to
 this
 there's


also
 a
 very
 interesting
 new
 uh
 golden


visa
 program
 again
 this
 was
 initially


floated
 out
 at
 a
 price
 point
 of
 about
 5


million.
 I'm
 guessing
 5
 million
 was
 just


too
 rich
 for
 most
 people.
 Now
 it's
 at
 1


million.
 So
 basically,
 if
 you
 pay
 $1


million,
 you
 can
 come
 and
 uh
 have
 a


green
 card
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 So
 I


actually
 think
 this
 is
 something
 that
 is


a
 pretty
 good
 idea.
 So
 throughout
 the


world,
 globally,
 golden
 visa
 programs


are
 pretty
 common.
 Some
 very
 successful


ones
 are
 I
 would
 say
 in
 Portugal
 and


previously
 in
 Malta
 where
 if
 you
 just


pay
 some
 money
 say
 go
 buy
 a
 house
 maybe


buy
 some
 stocks
 in
 Portugal
 or
 some


other
 places
 uh
 you
 can
 have
 EU


citizenship
 very
 attractive
 for
 many


expats
 especially
 let's
 say
 wealthy


Americans
 would
 like
 to
 have
 access
 or


be
 able
 to
 live
 in
 the
 EU
 now
 globally


of
 course
 a
 lot
 of
 rich
 people


everywhere
 in
 the
 world
 say
 in
 China
 in


the
 Middle
 East
 and
 so
 forth
 and
 they're


looking
 for
 other
 residences
 maybe
 just


the
 plan
 B.
 Maybe
 they
 just
 want
 to
 live


in
 another
 country.
 For
 them,
 money
 is


not
 a
 problem
 and
 so
 they're
 happy
 to


pay
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 money.
 Now,
 usually


though,
 to
 be
 clear,
 golden
 visa


countries
 are
 countries
 that
 are
 not


doing
 well
 financially
 and
 they
 just


want
 to
 have
 an
 extra
 some
 extra


revenue.
 So,
 it's
 very
 uncommon
 for
 a


wealthy
 country
 like
 the
 United
 States


to
 have
 something
 like
 this.
 But
 just
 $1


million
 to
 have
 access
 to
 to
 be
 able
 to


live
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 have
 access


to
 to
 the
 market.
 So
 that
 I
 think
 that's


something
 that
 many
 rich
 people
 will


gladly
 pay.
 Honestly,
 it's
 not
 that
 much


money.
 One
 thing
 that's
 not
 good
 about


this
 though
 is
 that
 for
 many
 other


Golden
 Visa
 programs,
 it's
 a
 investment.


So,
 you
 know,
 you
 get
 some
 return
 or
 at


least
 your
 money
 back
 after
 some
 years.


Here,
 it's
 seems
 to
 be
 just
 a
 donation.


So,
 you're
 actually
 paying
 a
 million


dollar
 fee
 or
 2
 million
 if
 you're
 a


company
 sponsoring
 someone
 to
 um
 to
 have


a
 to
 have
 residency
 in
 the
 United


States.
 So,
 it
 is
 a
 hefty
 fee.
 However,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 rich
 people
 in
 the


world,
 I
 think,
 especially
 people
 who,


you
 know,
 maybe
 they
 made
 their
 money
 in


illegitimate
 means
 and
 they
 they
 want
 to


be
 able
 to
 at
 least
 let
 their
 family


live
 in
 a
 country
 safe
 from
 uh
 from


investigation.
 I
 think
 that
 it's
 quite


attractive.
 So,
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 this


will
 generate
 some
 revenue.


All right.
 So,
 that's
 super
 interesting.


Let's
 see
 how
 this
 continues
 to
 evolve.


Also,
 not
 talking
 about
 it
 this
 time,


but
 the
 the
 president
 also
 suggests
 some


new
 industrial
 policy.
 They're
 taking


that
 $550
 billion
 investment
 fund,
 which


appears
 to
 be
 real
 uh
 that
 Japan
 is


putting
 up
 trying
 to
 invest
 in
 more


factories
 or
 maybe
 uh
 some
 kind
 of


support
 for
 American
 manufacturing.
 So,


there's
 definitely
 some
 new
 developments


in
 industrial
 policy
 that
 we'll
 hear


more
 of
 going
 forward.
 All
 right,
 so


that's
 all
 I've
 prepared.
 Thanks
 so
 much


for
 tuning
 in.
 Talk
 to
 you
 guys
 next


week.
