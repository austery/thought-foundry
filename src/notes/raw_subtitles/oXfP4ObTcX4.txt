hey
 this
 is
 Daria
 I
 got
 quite
 a
 bit
 of


backlash
 on
 the
 statement
 that
 I
 made
 in


my
 first
 video
 where
 I
 said
 that
 I
 do


not
 recommend
 front-end
 developer
 ux
 and


UI
 roles
 to
 those
 of
 you
 who
 are
 looking


to
 enter
 the
 tech
 field
 in
 2025
 feelings


have
 been
 hurt
 there
 are
 quite
 a
 few


people
 the
 role
 and
 the
 complexity
 of


the
 role
 of
 a
 ux
 designer
 and
 a


front-end
 developer
 especially
 under
 my


shorts
 so
 let's
 address
 that
 and
 also


talk
 about
 the
 main
 theme
 of
 this
 video


how
 to
 choose
 a
 career
 in
 Tech
 if
 you


don't
 know
 where
 to
 start
 or
 cannot
 seem


to
 find
 your


calling
 I'm
 filming
 this
 video
 for
 a
 few


profiles
 of
 people
 number
 one
 early


career
 professionals
 University
 grads
 or


even
 perhaps
 high
 school
 students
 and


number
 two
 the
 people
 who
 are
 thinking


about
 doing
 a
 career
 pivot
 for
 whatever


reason
 and
 they're
 thinking
 about
 tech


so
 let
 me
 start
 by
 saying
 that
 you
 do


not
 need
 need
 a
 dream
 and
 you
 do
 not


need
 a
 calling
 otherwise
 you
 risk
 your


entire
 life
 searching
 for
 one
 while
 life


passes
 You
 by
 and
 you
 keep
 living


paycheck
 to
 paycheck
 just
 a
 bit
 of


background
 on
 myself
 I
 was
 a
 kid
 who
 did


not
 know
 what
 to
 pick
 when
 I
 was


approaching
 the
 end
 of
 high
 school
 and


thinking
 about
 what
 I
 would
 want
 to


major
 in
 I
 had
 absolutely
 no
 idea
 and


the
 reason
 I
 had
 no
 idea
 is
 because
 my


parents
 never
 really
 instilled
 any
 sort


of
 standard
 path
 in
 me
 there
 was
 no
 such


thing
 as
 when
 you
 grow
 up
 you
 have
 to


become
 insert
 whatever
 it
 is
 that
 they


wanted
 there
 were
 two
 things
 they
 asked


of
 me
 I
 had
 to
 study
 hard
 and
 develop
 a


high
 intellect
 number
 two
 they
 asked
 me


to
 become
 extremely
 competent
 in


whatever
 it
 is
 that
 I
 choose
 to
 do


because
 when
 you
 are
 very
 competent


you're
 going
 to
 be
 very
 confident
 so
 on


one
 hand
 I
 was
 very
 lucky
 to
 not
 be


programmed
 into
 a
 certain
 career
 on
 the


other
 hand
 when
 most
 of
 my
 friends
 had


their
 dream
 job
 job
 or
 something
 that


they
 really
 wanted
 to
 pursue
 After
 High


School
 I
 was
 completely
 lost
 I
 could
 do


sciences
 I
 could
 do
 stats
 I
 could
 do


business
 I
 could
 do
 whatever
 I
 wanted
 I


was
 even
 considering
 a
 career
 of
 a


classical
 musician
 but
 the
 problem
 is
 I


did
 not
 have
 a
 dream
 of
 what
 I
 wanted
 to


become
 and
 guess
 what
 I
 picked
 when
 I


went
 to
 College
 culinary
 arts
 and


Hospitality
 watched
 way
 too
 much
 Master


Chef
 France
 and
 thought
 that
 I
 would


become
 the
 next
 puku
 I
 thought
 being
 a


chef
 is
 pretty
 much
 like
 being
 a
 chemist


and
 an
 artist
 two
 in
 one
 and
 have
 an


insanely
 creative
 mind
 where
 you
 get
 to


work
 with
 things
 like
 heat
 cold
 fats


acids
 Vapor
 all
 kinds
 of
 textures


components
 and
 variations
 of
 those


components
 to
 invoke
 emotions
 in
 another


human
 being
 yeah
 thank
 God
 I
 went
 to


work
 at
 a
 restaurant
 two
 weeks
 into
 that


program
 and
 a
 couple
 of
 days
 made
 me


realize
 that
 that
 was
 not
 what
 I
 wanted


to
 do
 with
 my
 life
 I
 don't
 regret
 it
 it


taught
 me
 a
 lot
 how
 glamorized
 depiction


of
 a
 job
 can
 differ
 from
 what
 is
 really


happening
 in
 the
 industry
 and
 I
 quit


that
 program
 without
 even
 finishing
 the


first
 semester
 I
 still
 find
 it


fascinating
 to
 watch
 how
 big
 restaurants


operate
 but
 thank
 God
 I'm
 not
 doing
 it


for
 a
 living
 my
 parents
 knew
 nothing


about
 that
 industry
 they
 wanted
 me
 to
 be


happy
 and
 I
 did
 not
 think
 of
 talking
 to


anybody
 who
 actually
 worked
 in
 the


culinary
 industry
 at
 the
 time
 and
 had
 I


done
 proper
 research
 I
 would
 have
 never


picked
 that
 even
 though
 I
 do
 like
 the


restaurant
 industry
 and
 I
 do
 like


culinary
 arts
 there
 is
 a
 reason
 why


France
 and
 Italy
 are
 the
 culinary


capitals
 of
 Europe
 it
 has
 a
 lot
 to
 do


with
 the
 terroir
 with
 the
 climate
 with


the
 livestock
 they
 have
 and
 with
 the


eating
 culture
 in
 those
 countries
 the


last
 thing
 I
 was
 thinking
 at
 the
 time


was
 researching
 the
 economics
 of
 a


restaurant
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 is
 one
 of


the
 riskiest
 businesses
 to
 run
 because


your
 main
 asset
 the
 food
 expires
 in
 3
 to


4
 days
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 is
 a


business
 with
 very
 low
 profitability
 now


you
 may
 argue
 and
 say
 well
 if
 we're


talking
 about
 food
 and
 drink
 you
 may


just
 open
 another
 franchise
 of


McDonald's
 sure
 but
 frankly
 that
 goes


against
 my
 own
 beliefs
 around


authenticity
 and
 a
 character
 in
 a


business
 in
 retrospect
 I
 I
 realized
 that


I
 was
 probably
 one
 of
 the
 luckiest
 kids


exactly
 because
 I
 did
 not
 know
 what
 to


pick
 I
 had
 one
 end
 goal
 and
 that
 was
 to


be
 very
 successful
 financially
 I
 did
 not


have
 this
 dream
 Quantified
 I
 did
 not


know
 how
 much
 money
 I
 needed
 I
 could


really
 feel
 the
 difference
 between
 $100


million
 And1
 billion
 at
 that
 age
 I
 mean


I
 could
 do
 the
 math
 and
 see
 the


difference
 between
 the
 numbers
 but
 I
 had


no
 idea
 between
 lifestyle
 differences


and
 impact
 that
 someone
 with
 $100


million
 could
 do
 and
 someone
 with1


billion
 do
 could
 do
 I
 didn't
 know
 how
 to


get
 there
 I
 didn't
 know
 what
 I
 wanted
 to


do
 all
 I
 knew
 is
 that
 I
 wanted
 to
 become


very
 successful
 financially
 in
 an


ethical
 way
 and
 I
 was
 open
 to
 pretty


much
 any
 career
 that
 would
 get
 me
 there


in
 the
 shortest
 period
 of
 time
 so
 I
 quit


culinary
 school
 and
 went
 to
 study


business
 I
 was
 hustling
 non-stop
 to


Kickstart
 My
 Career
 as
 soon
 as
 possible


and
 I
 ended
 up
 Landing
 my
 first


full-time
 role
 in
 Tech
 at
 19
 well
 before


I
 finished
 college
 and
 that
 job
 happened


to
 be
 at
 a
 tech
 company
 I
 don't
 want
 to


say
 that
 I
 was
 very
 lucky
 to
 have
 been


able
 to
 start
 a
 full-time
 gig
 at
 19
 that


wasn't
 luck
 that
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 hard
 work


but
 you
 know
 how
 many
 college
 kids
 get


to
 work
 Barista
 jobs
 or
 sales
 associates


and
 they
 don't
 get
 to
 experience
 the


full-time
 version
 of
 whatever
 it
 is
 that


they're
 studying
 until
 they're
 either


Graduate
 University
 or
 very
 close
 to


graduating
 college
 or
 university
 and


only
 when
 you're
 reaching
 that
 level


when
 you're
 about
 to
 graduate
 you
 start


to
 actually
 research
 things
 such
 as


salary
 for
 example
 and
 salary
 an
 easy


one
 cuz
 even
 a
 lot
 of
 high
 school
 kids


look
 into
 salaries
 to
 have
 an


understanding
 of
 what
 they're
 going
 to


be
 making
 but
 things
 like
 applying
 for


jobs
 and
 realizing
 how
 difficult
 it


actually
 is
 to
 land
 one
 looking
 at
 the


state
 of
 the
 job
 market
 looking
 at
 the


competition
 looking
 at
 the
 number
 of


open
 roles
 looking
 at
 the
 structure
 of


the
 teams
 they
 will
 be
 joining
 all
 of


that
 usually
 happens
 when
 you're
 almost


done
 studying
 for
 whatever
 it
 is
 that


you've
 picked
 what
 did
 my
 first
 job


teach
 me
 number
 one
 Business
 Degree
 was


not
 enough
 at
 least
 not
 for
 me
 I
 felt
 a


significant
 academic
 Gap
 and
 I
 knew
 that


I
 would
 be
 going
 back
 to
 school
 number


two
 I
 realized
 how
 much
 money
 you
 could


be
 making
 in
 Tech
 and
 I
 knew
 that
 the


industry
 was
 right
 I
 did
 not
 have
 a


strong
 push
 but
 instead
 of
 making
 the


same
 mistakes
 that
 I
 made
 when
 I
 was
 17


I
 chose
 to
 sit
 down
 and
 do
 my
 research


so
 to
 all
 people
 who
 feel
 lost
 and
 don't


know
 what
 to
 choose
 and
 don't
 feel
 that


inner
 push
 towards
 anything


congratulations
 you
 won
 the
 golden


ticket
 you
 were
 completely
 avoiding
 the


possibility
 of
 falling
 in
 love
 with
 a


craft
 only
 to
 find
 out
 that
 to
 have
 a


passion
 for
 something
 and
 to
 do
 it
 for
 a


living
 are
 two
 different
 things
 now
 what


should
 you
 do
 if
 this
 is
 you
 right
 now


be
 very
 strategic
 and
 very
 pragmatic


about
 your
 next
 steps
 there
 are
 plenty


of
 jobs
 that
 are
 emerging
 right
 now
 that


were
 not
 a
 thing
 5
 years
 ago
 even
 my
 job


product
 management
 was
 not
 a
 thing
 10


years
 ago
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 a
 thing
 but
 it


was
 very
 rare
 and
 there
 are
 even
 more


jobs
 that
 will
 keep
 popping
 up
 in
 the


next
 5
 to
 10
 years
 that
 we
 don't
 know


about
 so
 what
 you
 need
 to
 do
 is
 to
 not


only
 pick
 a
 job
 that
 will
 keep
 you


afloat
 for
 the
 next
 5
 to
 10
 years
 but


something
 that
 will
 make
 you
 future


proof
 how
 to
 assess
 which
 Tech
 Career
 is


worth
 pursuing
 number
 one
 research


market
 conditions
 look
 into
 things
 such


as
 Gardner
 hype
 cycle
 look
 what's


trending
 look
 what
 will
 be
 trending
 for


the
 jobs
 that
 are
 already
 plateauing
 you


should
 know
 that
 there
 are
 plenty
 of


talent
 in
 those
 jobs
 already
 and
 if
 you


choose
 to
 enter
 those
 positions
 you
 will


be
 competing
 with
 people
 who
 have
 been


doing
 that
 job
 for
 a
 while
 and
 yes
 many


of
 them
 have
 progressed
 into
 senior


principal
 director
 VP
 level
 already
 so


they're
 probably
 looking
 for
 junior


talent
 but
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 tell
 you
 that


technology
 is
 developing
 very
 fast
 not


every
 Junior
 job
 is
 worth
 pursuing
 guys


we
 are
 not
 in
 the
 80s
 and
 not
 of
 it
 in


2000s
 the
 fact
 that
 people
 who
 have
 been


building
 their
 careers
 in
 the
 industries


that
 are
 currently
 plateauing
 have
 grown


into
 principal
 or
 managerial
 roles
 does


not
 mean
 that
 there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


onetoone
 replacement
 I
 hope
 you


understand
 that
 you
 see
 what's
 happening


with
 thei
 on
 the
 market
 you
 see
 how
 many


tasks
 are
 being
 automated
 the
 Tas
 tasks


that
 are
 typically
 being
 performed
 by


Junior
 people
 look
 for
 the
 number
 of


open
 jobs
 of
 the
 role
 that
 you're


targeting
 and
 look
 how
 it's
 been


changing
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 years


and
 whether
 it's
 projected
 to
 grow
 two


look
 into
 Data
 around
 layoffs
 you
 need


to
 understand
 which
 jobs
 are
 being
 laid


off
 right
 now
 and
 which
 ones
 are


projected
 to
 be
 laid
 off
 and
 most


importantly
 why
 people
 are
 being
 laid


off
 it's
 one
 thing
 to
 be
 laid
 off
 if
 a


company
 is
 readjusting
 their
 priorities


and
 needs
 to
 save
 money
 it's
 another


thing
 when
 half
 of
 the
 responsibilities


of
 this
 job
 can
 now
 be
 performed
 by
 an


AI
 agent
 number
 three
 look
 into


Innovation
 conditions
 what
 part
 of
 your


target
 role
 can
 be
 automated
 and
 also


when
 you
 enter
 the
 field
 you
 will


probably
 be
 entering
 it
 as
 a
 junior


specialist
 so
 what
 percentage
 of
 a


junior
 specialist
 responsibilities
 can


be
 automated
 in
 the
 next
 5
 to
 10
 years


actually
 not
 even
 5
 to
 10
 I
 want
 to
 say


3
 to
 five
 now
 I
 promised
 you
 to
 talk


about
 the
 backlash
 I
 got
 on
 my
 statement


around
 front-end
 development
 let's
 look


at
 this
 data
 the
 number
 of
 job
 postings


dropped
 by
 70%
 now
 senior
 full
 stack


developers
 will
 not
 go
 away
 they
 have


nothing
 to
 worry
 about
 at
 least
 for
 now


but
 II
 technology
 such
 as
 Transformer


based
 models
 like
 gb4
 gbt
 4.5
 are


increasingly
 automating
 certain
 coding


tasks
 not
 all
 of
 them
 but
 some
 and
 a
 lot


of
 those
 simple
 coding
 tasks
 are


typically
 being
 done
 by
 Junior
 devs
 the


real
 challenge
 for
 junior
 devs
 is
 not
 so


much
 the
 fact
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 be


replaced
 by
 AI
 but
 rather
 increased


expectations
 for
 self-sufficiency
 many


companies
 now
 prefer
 mid-level
 to
 senior


level
 devs
 who
 can
 perform
 tasks
 end
 to


end
 and
 that
 makes
 it
 harder
 for
 juniors


to
 enter
 their
 first
 role
 in
 software


development
 you
 have
 to
 be
 real
 about


the
 conditions
 of
 the
 Innovation
 people


are
 creating
 their
 own
 apps
 these
 days


without
 being
 able
 to
 write
 a
 single


line
 of
 production
 ready
 code
 this
 is


not
 to
 say
 that
 the
 job
 of
 a
 front-end


developer
 is
 easy
 this
 is
 not
 to
 say


that
 CSS
 is
 easy
 there
 were
 people


saying
 how
 only
 someone
 who
 has
 never


done
 CSS
 before
 can
 say
 that
 front-end


development
 is
 easy
 I
 am
 not
 saying
 that


it's
 easy
 what
 I'm
 saying
 is
 that
 if
 I


had
 a
 20-year-old
 or
 a
 40-year-old


looking
 to
 switch
 jobs
 talking
 to
 me
 and


asking
 for
 advice
 on
 which
 job
 to
 enter


I
 would
 not
 be
 recommending
 front-end


development
 because
 first
 of
 all
 they're


going
 to
 have
 a
 very
 hard
 time
 Landing


that
 first
 job
 and
 they
 may
 lose
 all


motivation
 they
 had
 number
 two
 even
 if


the
 land
 the
 job
 they're
 going
 to


struggle
 big
 time
 in
 the
 next
 3
 to
 5


years
 because
 they
 will
 have
 to
 upskill


dramatically
 am
 I
 worried
 about
 my
 job


not
 really
 again
 because
 I'm
 not
 Junior


but
 even
 I
 am
 doing
 a
 ton
 of
 upscaling


on
 the
 side
 and
 I
 am
 fully
 prepared
 for


the
 world
 where
 my
 position
 doesn't


exist
 anymore
 and
 should
 something


happen
 to
 my
 role
 I
 can
 diversify
 the


roles
 I'm
 applying
 for
 in
 the
 future
 so


say
 what
 you
 will
 but
 I
 stand
 by
 what
 I


said
 number
 four
 look
 at
 employment


conditions
 what
 team
 you're
 you're
 going


to
 be
 a
 part
 of
 how
 many
 open
 jobs
 are


available
 on
 a
 team
 when
 you
 start


applying
 what
 does
 the
 hierarchy
 look


like
 is
 there
 a
 junior
 middle
 senior


principal
 like
 what
 does
 that
 look
 like


now
 going
 back
 to
 the
 ux
 example
 ux
 has


one
 spot
 per
 team
 so
 if
 you
 were
 to


enter
 ux
 in
 2025
 and
 look
 at
 the
 hype


cycle
 and
 do
 your
 research
 about
 the


market
 you
 should
 also
 add
 to
 it
 the


fact
 that
 you
 will
 be
 competing
 for
 one


job
 on
 a
 product
 development
 team
 there


is
 nothing
 wrong
 with
 ux
 there
 is


nothing
 wrong
 with
 this
 job
 it
 is
 a
 very


important
 job
 it
 is
 a
 necessary
 part
 of


the
 product
 development
 life
 cycle
 and


I've
 gotten
 some
 comments
 under
 my


videos
 saying
 well
 you're
 saying
 not
 to


pursue
 ux
 but
 the
 design
 of
 half
 of
 my


apps
 that
 I
 have
 my
 phone
 is
 still


pretty
 crappy
 so
 how
 come
 we
 don't
 need


designers
 even
 though
 the
 current
 apps


even
 the
 current
 apps
 are
 not
 perfect
 in


terms
 of
 ux
 well
 to
 that
 I
 say
 do
 you


think
 that
 the
 design
 of
 the
 apps
 that


are
 commonly
 used
 is
 crappy
 because


there
 are
 no
 good
 designers
 who
 can


create
 good
 design


or
 maybe
 just
 maybe
 designers
 are
 not


the
 ones
 who
 dictate
 what
 the
 company


should
 invest
 into
 or
 perhaps
 it
 is
 not


fully
 up
 to
 ux
 to
 decide
 how
 the
 app
 is


going
 to
 look
 like
 because
 companies


have
 other
 priorities
 and
 if
 the
 design


is
 good
 enough
 they
 just
 move
 on
 and


invest
 in
 something
 else
 if
 you
 happen


to
 be
 at
 a
 company
 that
 prioritizes
 ux


fantastic
 but
 most
 companies
 especially


B2B
 aren't
 ux
 driven
 on
 top
 of
 that
 we


are
 in
 the
 era
 where
 software
 as
 a


service
 is
 a
 very
 developed
 industry
 and


lots
 of
 apps
 repeat
 themselves
 if
 you're


lucky
 enough
 to
 join
 a
 company
 that
 is


building
 something
 Innovative
 something


that
 the
 world
 hasn't
 seen
 before


amazing
 but
 the
 rest
 of
 you
 will
 be


learning
 from
 the
 existing
 patterns
 and


repeating
 similar
 patterns
 in
 their
 own


products
 those
 patterns
 are
 exactly
 what


makes
 ux
 prototyping
 a
 lot
 easier
 these


days
 so
 much
 so
 that
 even
 a
 non-er
 can


do
 those
 things
 by
 themselves
 again
 this


is
 not
 to
 say
 that
 ux
 is
 a
 necessary
 job


this
 is
 to
 say
 that
 the
 need
 for
 junior


ux
 designers
 is
 on
 the
 decline
 number


five
 Market
 saturation
 and
 entry


conditions
 like
 I
 said
 if
 you
 are
 about


to
 enter
 a
 job
 with
 a
 low
 barrier
 to


entry
 you
 should
 be
 expecting
 a
 very


high
 competition
 and
 a
 very
 long
 time


looking
 for
 a
 job
 ux
 happens
 to
 be
 a


popular
 job
 for
 people
 who
 want
 to
 enter


the
 tech
 industry
 without
 having
 to
 code


and
 you
 may
 argue
 that
 a
 good
 uxer


should
 have
 a
 very
 good
 knowledge
 of


front-end
 development
 all
 of
 that
 is


true
 but
 let's
 be
 honest
 a
 lot
 of
 people


think
 about
 ux
 because
 they
 don't
 want


to
 code
 if
 ux
 is
 something
 you
 truly


want
 to
 do
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 your
 life


because
 you
 are
 artistic
 you
 feel
 that


inner
 talent
 and
 push
 towards
 ux
 do
 your


research
 about
 how
 this
 job
 is
 changing


and
 develop
 a
 skill
 set
 that
 will
 be


very
 difficult
 to
 replace
 of
 course
 you


cannot
 predict
 what
 new
 AI
 is
 going
 to


come
 out
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 from
 now
 but


if
 you're
 already
 seeing
 people
 who
 were


unable
 to
 produce
 their
 own
 designs
 or


unable
 to
 write
 code
 build
 their
 own


apps
 with
 Claud
 or
 gbt
 you
 can
 make
 a


conclusion
 that
 a
 front-end
 developer
 or


a
 ux
 designer
 with
 a
 very
 standard
 skill


set
 does
 not
 have
 a
 very
 long
 career


trajectory
 the
 ones
 that
 are
 already
 in


the
 industry
 need
 to
 upscale
 let
 alone


those
 who
 are
 thinking
 about
 entering
 it


number
 six
 compensation
 I'm
 very
 biased


here
 so
 take
 this
 with
 a
 grain
 of
 salt
 I


do
 not
 relate
 to
 people
 who
 want
 to
 have


a
 chill
 life
 and
 just
 enough
 money
 to


pay
 the
 bills
 there
 is
 absolutely


nothing
 wrong
 with
 that
 it's
 just
 it's


not
 me
 this
 is
 the
 view
 that
 I
 apply
 to


everything
 I'm
 talking
 about
 on
 this


channel
 I
 want
 people
 and
 especially


young
 people
 to
 have
 a
 very
 high
 quality


of
 life
 I
 want
 more
 people
 to
 not
 have


to
 worry
 about
 money
 and
 be
 able
 to


spend
 their
 energy
 on
 things
 that
 are


going
 to
 make
 this
 world
 better
 I
 want


more
 Youth
 Travel
 further
 than
 the


country
 they
 were
 born
 in
 I
 want
 more


people
 to
 have
 an
 ability
 to
 take
 risks


and
 build
 their
 own
 businesses
 the


description
 of
 this
 channel
 says
 I
 want


to
 help
 people
 build
 a
 financially


rewarding
 career
 so
 no
 I
 am
 not


recommending
 jobs
 that
 will
 pay
 you
 150k


at
 the
 peak
 of
 the
 career
 because
 there


are
 jobs
 that
 pay
 100K
 for
 entry
 level


roles
 and
 I
 know
 it's
 very
 fashionable


ble
 to
 say
 how
 you
 should
 not
 take


anything
 for
 granted
 and
 you
 should
 be


grateful
 for
 every
 dollar
 and
 not
 speak


about
 money
 like
 that
 I
 am
 grateful
 for


everything
 I
 have
 and
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be


playing
 a
 victim
 and
 I
 was
 also
 making


$25
 and
 $30,000
 and
 I
 was
 very
 happy


when
 I
 was
 making
 that
 money
 because
 I


was
 making
 it
 by
 myself
 nobody
 gave
 it


to
 me
 I
 was
 making
 it
 with
 my
 own
 brain


but
 having
 ambition
 does
 not
 mean
 you're


going
 to
 be
 taking
 everything
 for


granted
 having
 ambition
 does
 not
 mean


that
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 grateful
 for


every
 dollar
 you're
 making
 so
 no
 I


cannot
 relate
 to
 people
 who
 want
 to


enter
 Tech
 and
 make
 50
 Grand
 I
 don't
 and


number
 seven
 transferability
 of
 skills


you
 should
 be
 fully
 prepared
 for
 what's


to
 come
 if
 your
 job
 disappears
 a
 couple


of
 years
 from
 now
 the
 skill
 set
 that


you're
 developing
 should
 give
 you
 at


least
 a
 few
 career
 paths
 that
 you
 can


have
 in
 mind
 if
 you
 pursue
 computer


science
 you
 can
 pivot
 into
 data
 science


you
 can
 go
 to
 software
 engineering
 you


can
 go
 into
 devops
 it
 there's
 multiple


paths
 you
 can
 pursue
 cyber
 security
 is


one
 of
 them
 as
 well
 if
 you're
 in
 product


management
 you
 can
 easily
 jump
 into


growth
 if
 you're
 more
 technical
 you
 can


go
 to
 software
 development
 or
 data


science
 you
 can
 switch
 to
 marketing


there's
 a
 few
 paths
 there
 as
 well
 if
 you


limit
 your
 training
 to
 a
 frontend


developer
 skill
 set
 and
 this
 job
 sees
 us


to
 exist
 tomorrow
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 a


very
 hard
 time
 relearning
 what
 what
 you


need
 to
 know
 for
 other
 adjacent
 roles
 so


might
 as
 well
 do
 the
 harder
 thing
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 your
 career
 and
 perhaps


start
 as
 a
 frontend
 Dev
 but
 be
 able
 to


grow
 rather
 than
 getting
 stuck
 in
 this


role
 and
 not
 knowing
 what
 to
 do
 if
 you


get
 laid
 off
 or
 if
 the
 job
 disappears
 I


got
 a
 comment
 under
 my
 last
 video
 from
 a


young
 person
 saying
 that
 they
 were


thinking
 about
 getting
 into
 ux
 because


they
 were
 looking
 for
 a
 job
 in
 Tech
 that


would
 require
 coding
 I
 responded
 to
 them


in
 comments
 but
 what
 I
 wanted
 to
 repeat


is
 that
 that
 when
 you
 put
 that
 kind
 of
 a


condition
 no
 coding
 on
 your
 job
 search


or
 on
 Career
 planning
 you
 should


understand
 that
 if
 you
 put
 those


conditions
 in
 one
 row
 Tech
 job
 no
 coding


High


salary
 you're
 signing
 up
 for
 one
 of
 the


following
 scenarios
 one
 you
 get
 a
 job


that
 requires
 a
 big
 set
 of
 soft
 skills


for
 example
 sales
 sales
 people
 make
 a


lot
 of
 money
 and
 don't
 code
 but
 let's
 be


honest
 not
 everybody
 can
 do
 sales
 so


while
 sales
 does
 not
 have
 a
 high
 barrier


to
 entry
 in
 terms
 of
 technical
 skills


you
 got
 to
 have
 a
 very
 thick
 skin
 to


survive
 sales
 and
 the
 beauty
 of
 this
 job


is
 that
 it
 can
 be
 done
 at
 any
 age
 by


anyone
 coming
 from
 any
 background
 but


you
 have
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 sell
 it
 is
 not


an
 easy
 skill
 to
 learn
 yeah
 they
 don't


need
 to
 code
 but
 go
 and
 try
 making
 a


living
 by
 convincing
 others
 to
 buy
 from


you
 frankly
 I
 don't
 know
 what's
 easier


learning
 data
 signs
 or
 learning
 how
 to


sell
 depends
 on
 your
 personality
 or
 two


you
 pick
 a
 job
 that
 doesn't
 require
 hard


technical
 skills
 and
 doesn't
 require


very
 specific
 soft
 skills
 like
 sales


what
 are
 we
 left
 with
 ux
 and
 probably


technical
 project
 management
 and
 if
 you


were
 to
 pursue
 that
 route
 what
 do
 you


get
 in
 return
 much
 higher
 competition


and
 lesser
 salaries
 because
 there
 is


more
 Supply
 than
 demand
 and
 I
 don't
 want


to
 be
 making
 any
 generalized
 statements


based
 on
 the
 people
 I
 know
 because
 I


know
 that
 it's
 just
 it's
 a
 tiny
 sample


of
 of
 this
 group
 that
 I
 personally
 know


but
 of
 the
 people
 that
 I
 have
 met
 in


real
 life
 the
 people
 that
 I
 you
 know


have
 a
 certain
 connection
 with
 I
 can


name
 at
 least
 nine
 who
 were
 looking
 for


a
 ux
 job
 for
 over
 a
 year
 and
 did
 not


land
 one
 why
 did
 I
 pick
 product
 because


it
 is
 the
 only
 job
 on
 a
 product


development
 team
 that
 makes
 as
 much
 as


engineering
 has
 a
 very
 high


transferability
 of
 skills
 and
 it
 is
 the


best
 job
 if
 your
 end
 goal
 is


entrepreneurship
 which
 is
 my
 case
 so
 if


you
 take
 into
 consideration
 everything
 I


told
 you
 about
 myself
 having
 a
 job
 that


will
 prepare
 me
 for
 entrepreneurship


better
 than
 anything
 else
 and
 give
 me
 a


high
 salary
 to
 give
 myself
 an


opportunity
 to
 live
 a


joyful
 full
 of
 energy
 full
 of
 memories


life
 I
 think
 I
 made
 the
 best
 choice
 but


I
 again
 I
 made
 my
 choice
 70
 years
 ago
 if


I
 were
 to
 do
 this
 again
 in
 2025
 I
 don't


think
 I
 would
 be
 going
 for
 product


management
 if
 I
 imagine
 myself
 being
 17


again
 I
 would
 not
 be
 resistant
 to


learning
 technical
 skills
 because
 even


if
 you
 feel
 like
 you're
 going
 to
 be


struggling
 a
 lot
 it's
 short-term
 pain


for
 a
 long-term
 gain
 this
 is
 my
 own
 bias


I
 completely
 recognize
 that
 but
 I
 feel


like
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 not
 willing
 to


pursue
 technical
 jobs
 not
 because
 they


don't
 have
 an
 aptitude
 for
 technical


abilities
 but
 because
 of
 a
 mental
 block


it's
 more
 fear
 than
 actual
 difficulty
 if


you
 want
 to
 pursue
 a
 career
 of
 a
 cyber


security
 business
 professional
 who
 will


not
 be
 a
 cyber
 security
 engineer
 but


someone
 responsible
 for
 introducing


cyber
 security
 projects
 into
 an


organization
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 to


code
 every
 single
 day
 you're
 not
 going


to
 have
 to
 code
 at
 all
 but
 that


technical
 Acumen
 will
 be
 part
 of
 your


training
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 completely


dismiss
 the
 careers
 that
 are
 Adent
 to
 Ai


and
 Technical
 Fields
 only
 because
 that


Technical
 Training
 will
 be
 part
 of
 the


curriculum
 I
 completely
 understand
 that


there
 is
 that
 fear
 of
 failure
 fear
 of


not
 belonging
 in
 the
 technical
 community


but
 if
 you
 find
 a
 well
 structured
 course


with
 instructor
 or
 no
 instructor


whatever
 you
 prefer
 and
 realtime


feedback
 I
 am
 certain
 that
 a
 lot
 more


people
 would
 actually
 grow
 to
 love
 it


and
 find
 it
 very
 intellectually
 stimul


stimulating
 if
 they
 were
 to
 shut
 down


that
 mental
 block
 and
 actually
 give
 it
 a


try
 you
 have
 to
 understand
 applications


of
 avoiding
 hard
 things
 there
 are
 no


jobs
 in
 Tech
 that
 you
 don't
 have
 to


study
 hard
 for
 don't
 have
 to
 sacrifice


anything
 for
 and
 that
 would
 pay
 you
 a


ton
 of
 money
 I'm
 a
 big
 believer
 in
 hard


work
 and
 I
 want
 to
 motivate
 people
 to


find
 that
 inner
 fire
 and
 inner
 ambition


to
 pursue
 things
 that
 are
 hard
 because


the
 reward
 is
 worth
 it
 I
 did
 not
 create


this
 channel
 to
 preach
 average
 income


and
 average
 career
 be
 highly
 calculated


and
 highly
 pragmatic
 about
 your
 life


don't
 be
 afraid
 of
 difficulties
 because


while
 you're
 wasting
 time
 worrying
 about


things
 that
 you
 haven't
 experienced
 yet


someone's
 already
 doing
 it
 do
 hard


things
 and
 be
 honest
 with
 yourself
 with


best
 case
 and
 worst
 case
 scenarios
 for


the
 next
 10
 years
 this
 is
 a
 very


interesting
 topic
 for
 me
 and
 I
 really


hope
 that
 this
 video
 helps
 people
 who


feel
 lost


as
 well
 as
 younger
 people
 who
 graduate


universities
 and
 are
 not
 sure
 about
 what


to
 do
 next
 I
 would
 love
 to
 hear
 from
 you


guys
 if
 you
 have
 any
 questions
 please


ping
 me
 I
 will
 make
 sure
 to
 answer
 every


single
 one
 of
 you
 till
 next
 time
 bye
