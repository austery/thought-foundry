All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 another
 episode
 of
 Tech
 Bros.
 We
 are


live


uh
 on
 this
 Monday
 evening.
 I'm
 here
 with


Tanner
 and
 Roy.
 Uh
 how
 are
 you
 guys


doing?


>> Great.
 How
 are
 you
 guys?


>> I'm
 immediately
 being
 blamed
 in
 chat.
 I


uh
 was
 perfectly
 on
 time.


>> Bro,
 they're
 calling
 me
 a
 Mitt
 Powell.


This
 is
 ridiculous.


At
 least
 it's
 not
 emit
 S&P
 500.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 Exactly.
 Um,
 all
 right.


We
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about,
 a
 lot
 to
 get


into.
 Bunch
 of
 stuff
 that
 went
 on
 in
 the


world
 of
 Robin
 Hood
 over
 the
 weekend.


So,
 we'll
 talk
 about
 that.
 Uh,
 we
 will


get
 into
 some
 of
 this
 OpenAI
 Broadcom


stuff,
 which
 kind
 of
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 it


took
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 for
 a
 surprise.
 10


gigawatt
 deal.
 So,
 we'll
 get
 into
 that


and,
 uh,
 then
 any
 other
 headlines
 that


we've
 got
 going
 on.
 But,
 we
 do
 have
 a


special
 guest.
 We
 do
 have
 a
 special


guest.
 This
 person
 is
 a
 hood
 OG
 was


buying
 it
 at
 eight
 bucks
 a
 share.
 Uh


they've
 since
 probably
 quintupled
 their


position
 since
 they
 initially
 got
 in
 and


uh
 they've
 been
 using
 one
 part
 of
 Hood's


product
 immensely
 and
 I
 think
 that's


going to
 be
 a
 big
 topic
 today
 that
 we'll


discuss.
 So
 ladies
 and
 gentlemen,


introducing


Jason.


>> Testing.
 Testing.
 Does
 it
 work?


>> Yep,
 you're
 good.
 Works.


>> I
 have
 no
 echo.
 I
 was
 worried
 about


that.
 I've
 not
 used
 this
 place
 for
 a


stream
 yet.
 So,


>> looks
 good.


>> We
 are
 here.


>> We
 have


>> Dude,
 I
 like
 the
 background.
 Very


holiday.


>> I
 have
 a
 the
 game
 on.
 I
 don't
 know if


you
 guys
 are
 watching
 or
 if
 you
 have
 if


you
 have
 any
 live
 bets.


>> No,
 but
 but
 you
 made
 a
 good
 call
 there.


Uh
 I
 saw
 that.
 You
 know,
 I
 only
 dabble


in
 that
 side.
 I
 might
 have
 taken
 you


know


>> these
 guys
 Asian
 Steve


too
 funny.
 Listen
 you
 guys
 they
 the
 chat


doesn't
 know
 but
 like
 I've
 been
 like


badgering
 a
 mit
 since
 since
 tech
 bros


before
 tech
 bros
 was
 tech
 bros
 and
 I
 was


like
 dude
 do
 I
 how
 do
 I
 how
 do
 you
 get


on
 the
 show?
 This
 is
 like
 this
 is
 like
 a


2025
 like
 mission
 all
 year
 just
 to
 say


hello.
 I
 made
 it.


>> I
 think
 you
 just
 had
 to
 ask.
 He
 asked


like
 last
 week
 while
 we
 were
 live.
 Bro,


just
 come
 on
 next
 week.
 Like,


>> all right.
 So,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk


about,
 a
 lot
 to
 get
 into.
 I
 mean,


everyone
 on
 my
 channel
 knows
 Jason.
 He


does
 Technical
 Tuesday
 with
 me.
 If


you're
 on
 Tanner
 and
 Royy's
 channel,
 you


probably
 heard
 of
 Jason
 on
 X.
 I'll
 put


his
 X
 and
 YouTube
 in
 the
 in
 the
 chat
 in


a
 second.
 But,
 um,


>> I
 need
 to
 push
 this
 to
 our
 servers,
 too.


>> Yeah,
 push
 push
 it
 to
 your
 servers.


There
 are
 a
 couple
 of
 topics
 we'll
 touch


on
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 Robin
 and
 then
 we'll


get
 into
 all
 the
 tech
 stuff.
 And
 you


know,
 because
 Jason
 follows
 the
 Robin


Hood
 story,
 I
 think
 he'll
 be
 able
 to


provide
 some
 good
 input
 on
 it.
 Before
 we


get
 into
 prediction
 markets,
 which
 is
 a


big
 thing,
 let's
 talk
 about
 what


happened
 on
 Friday.
 3%
 draw
 down
 on
 the


S&P
 500,
 $19.5
 billion
 of
 crypto


liquidations.
 How
 it
 relates
 to
 Robin


Hood
 is
 outside
 of
 the
 stock
 going
 from


150
 to
 30.
 130.
 It's
 back
 up
 to
 140.
 I


don't
 think
 that's
 big
 of
 a
 deal.
 Is
 a


lot
 of
 people
 were
 not
 able
 to
 buy
 or


sell
 crypto
 during
 that
 time.
 So,
 I'll


give
 it
 to
 you
 Tanner.
 What
 was
 your


perception
 or
 at
 least
 perspective
 on


the
 perception
 that
 Robin
 Hood
 is


manipulating
 the
 little
 guy
 and
 not


allowing
 them
 to
 get
 their
 orders
 into


the
 market?


>> No,
 specifically
 on
 that,
 I
 I
 didn't


have
 any
 take.
 I
 mean,
 I
 that's
 not
 what


they're
 doing.
 They
 want
 retail
 to
 win.


They
 want
 retail
 to
 win
 more
 than


institutions.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 what
 allows


them
 to
 become
 the
 biggest
 financial


brokerage.
 So
 um
 any
 tools
 that
 they
 can


give
 and
 be
 faster
 than
 their


competitors
 is
 a
 higher
 likelihood
 that


they
 are
 going
 to
 be
 you
 know
 a
 large


trusted
 brand.
 So
 whatever
 had
 happened


um
 which
 I
 haven't
 looked
 into
 since
 to


be
 honest
 uh
 was
 not
 a
 good
 look
 and


they
 that
 wasn't
 on
 purpose
 not
 that
 I


would
 believe
 at least.
 So


yeah.
 Do
 you
 want
 any
 are
 we
 going
 to
 go


back
 around
 and
 actually
 talk
 about
 what


actually
 happened
 on
 Friday
 aside
 from


Robin
 Hood?
 Like
 the
 actual
 events
 that


un unfolded?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 we'll
 talk
 about
 it
 from
 a


sort
 of
 market
 macro
 perspective.


>> Okay.
 Then
 I'll
 I'll
 pass
 on
 to
 Roy
 and


we'll
 we'll
 we'll
 get
 back
 to
 that
 then.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 twice
 in
 a
 week,
 different


issues
 each
 time.
 One
 just
 specific
 to


crypto,
 the
 other
 was
 on
 Monday.
 Um,
 of


course,
 other
 brokerages
 both
 on
 the
 uh


trading
 side,
 the
 equity
 side,
 and
 also


on
 the
 crypto
 side
 were
 impacted.
 it


wasn't
 just
 a
 Robin
 Hood
 issue.
 So


Monday
 it
 could
 have
 been
 an
 API
 uh
 or
 a


data
 feed
 issue
 uh
 and
 likewise
 could
 be


that
 uh
 with
 one
 of
 these
 parties.
 Uh


but
 the
 other
 issue
 of
 course
 is
 the
 uh


the
 gas
 fee
 spiked
 immensely
 during


those
 type
 of
 events
 too.
 So
 probably


there's
 some
 work
 to
 be
 done
 on
 Robin


Hood's
 side
 just
 to
 of
 course
 make
 sure


that
 there's
 redundancy
 and
 resiliency


so
 they
 don't
 keep
 going
 down.
 It's
 not


a
 good
 thing
 no matter
 how
 you
 slice
 it.


Uh
 but
 also
 that
 if
 it
 was
 up,
 those
 gas


fees
 would
 have
 been
 ridiculous.
 Uh
 to


the
 point
 where
 it
 would
 have
 just
 eaten


up
 like
 entire
 trades
 and
 uh
 so
 they


need
 a
 a
 vehicle
 mechanism.
 They


probably
 rolled
 that
 out
 very
 quickly


just
 giving
 a
 warning
 of
 like,
 hey,


these
 are
 very
 elevated
 gas
 fees.
 Double


check
 that
 you're
 good
 with
 this
 before


we
 uh
 before
 you
 send
 it
 on
 or
 something


like
 that.
 So
 uh
 but
 yeah,
 overall
 not


not
 great.
 Robin
 Hood
 is
 getting
 most
 of


the
 attention
 just
 because
 it's
 market


shared,
 it's
 space
 share
 on
 X
 as
 well.


And
 we're
 in
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 Xecho


chamber,
 but
 also
 because
 of
 the
 the


some
 of
 the
 GameStop
 debacle
 from,
 you


know,
 a
 long
 time
 ago,
 which,
 you
 know,


is
 still
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 overhang,


but
 it
 doesn't
 break
 the
 thesis
 at
 all.


>> Jason,
 do
 you
 have a
 take
 on
 uh
 some
 of


the
 hate
 that
 Hood
 got
 over
 the
 weekend


or
 did
 you
 see
 any
 of
 it
 on
 X?


>> On
 the
 weekend?
 No,
 I
 missed
 it


thankfully.
 So,


>> okay.
 So,
 I
 I'll
 just
 give


>> prediction
 markets
 were
 working
 fine.


>> Yeah,
 prediction
 markets
 were
 working


fine.
 I'll
 give
 my
 take
 on
 this.
 I
 mean,


look,
 I
 agree
 with
 Josh's


>> Josh's
 argument
 here
 I
 thought
 was


really
 good.
 He
 said,
 "Look,
 for
 crypto,


people
 may
 have
 somewhat
 of
 a
 gripe,
 but


you
 must
 realize
 it's
 about
 liquidity.


Hood
 and
 other
 platforms
 who
 offer


crypto
 are
 having
 to
 deal
 with
 this
 in


real
 time.
 And
 crazy
 events
 like
 this,


aka
 20
 billion
 dollars
 of
 a
 liquidation


event.
 There
 isn't
 just
 enough
 to
 fill


orders."
 and
 he
 compared
 it
 to
 blaming


Apple
 for
 your
 iPhone
 delivery
 being


late
 because
 the
 UPS
 truck
 broke
 down.


That
 is
 not
 to
 excuse
 Hood
 from


obviously
 not
 being
 the
 the
 the
 the
 most


reliable
 exchange
 at
 that
 time,
 but
 but


I
 do
 agree
 it
 wasn't
 just
 Hood.
 I
 mean,


there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 platforms
 that


people
 said
 were
 having
 issues.
 And
 we


have
 not
 had
 a
 20
 billion
 crypto


liquidation
 event
 ever.
 I
 mean,
 COVID


was
 about
 three
 billion.
 So,
 this
 was


much
 higher
 than
 COVID
 and
 FTX
 combined.


And
 I
 think
 at
 that
 moment,
 you
 know,


and
 it
 was
 only
 about
 a
 30-minute
 span,


yeah,
 Robna
 was
 having
 liquidity
 issues.


Now,
 obviously,
 as
 Robno
 shareholders,


we
 want
 them
 to
 never
 have
 those


problems.
 But
 for
 the
 people
 saying,


"Short
 the
 stock,
 sell
 the
 stock.
 This


is
 the
 worst
 thing
 ever.
 There's
 a


conspiracy
 to
 screw
 the
 little
 guy."


It's
 like,
 to
 Tanner's
 point,
 they
 don't


get
 anything
 from
 screwing
 the
 little


guy.
 Like,
 they
 make
 all
 their
 money


from
 helping
 the
 little
 guy.
 So
 like
 and


there
 is
 no
 way
 in
 hell
 just
 based
 on
 I


think
 our
 analysis
 of
 Vlad
 as
 a
 founder


does
 he
 want
 to
 actively


cause
 issues
 for
 people
 to
 fulfill
 their


orders
 because
 he
 wants
 the
 stock
 to
 go


up.
 What
 helps
 the
 stock
 go
 up?
 People


trust
 your
 platform
 and
 they
 keep
 using


it.
 So
 I
 think
 those
 those
 conspiracies


are
 just
 a
 sign
 of
 people
 that
 don't


have
 a
 lot
 of
 intelligence
 quite


frankly.
 But
 is
 it
 a
 good
 look
 for
 Hood?


No.
 Is
 that
 a
 reason
 to
 sell
 the
 stock?


No.
 So,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 it's
 not


the
 best
 look,
 but
 it's
 also
 not
 a


reason
 why
 it's
 a
 thesis
 breaker
 by
 any


sense
 of
 the
 imagination.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Cool.
 All
 right.
 So,
 let's
 talk
 about


the
 big
 topic
 here,
 prediction
 markets.


Jason,
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 give
 you
 the


floor.
 Why
 do
 you
 love
 this
 product
 so


much?
 Why
 are
 you
 obsessed
 with
 using


this
 thing
 so
 much?
 I
 mean,
 well,
 when


it
 when
 it
 first
 came
 out,
 it
 was
 like,


okay,
 so
 so
 I
 run
 a
 community,
 an
 active


trading
 community
 with
 an
 active
 sports


betting
 component
 inside
 the
 community


and
 and
 we
 know
 and
 and and
 I'm
 an


active
 trader,
 but
 I
 know
 like
 how
 big


just
 this
 NFL
 season,
 like
 seasonally,


how
 big
 the
 NFL
 contracts
 can
 be
 in


terms
 of
 a
 revenue
 driver.
 And
 um


when
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 I
 was
 texting
 you


a
 minute.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Wait
 a
 second.


Has
 Vlad
 really
 not
 put
 out
 like
 a


single
 penny
 of
 revenue
 yet?"
 Like
 do


people
 At
 the
 time
 I
 think
 Hood
 was
 like


$100
 or
 maybe
 like
 115,
 something
 like


that.
 Not
 even
 that
 long
 ago.
 Um
 maybe


around
 120.
 Anyways,
 I
 was
 like,
 "How
 is


this
 not
 the
 biggest
 layup
 in
 the
 market


at
 the
 moment?"
 Because
 there
 was


nothing
 really


baked
 into
 the
 price.
 And
 and
 when
 I
 ran


the
 numbers,
 it
 was
 like,
 okay,
 first
 of


all,
 being
 in
 a
 unique
 position
 as


someone
 that
 does
 run
 the
 sports
 betting


a
 sports
 betting
 community,
 it's
 like


where
 it
 I
 can
 see
 and
 I
 and
 I
 think


Royy's
 seen
 this
 too,
 like


even
 today,
 Robin
 Hood
 is
 such
 a
 small


fraction
 of
 what's
 what
 they
 could


possibly
 get.
 And
 then
 watching
 how
 fast


Hood
 was
 ramping
 in
 the
 product


acceptance.
 So
 because
 I
 because
 of


where
 I
 sit,
 I
 also
 know
 that
 the


overlap
 between
 active
 traders,
 which


Vlad
 has
 said
 for
 many
 years
 that
 I
 want


to
 own
 the
 active
 trading
 space,
 the


overlap
 between
 active
 traders
 and


sports
 bers,
 active
 sports
 bers
 is
 like


60
 70%.
 Believe
 it
 or
 not,
 and
 so
 it


made
 sense
 from
 a
 strategic
 business


perspective.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Holy
 crap,


these
 businesses,
 the
 overlap
 between


these
 customer
 segments
 is
 massive."
 I'd


say
 about
 if
 you
 run
 the
 number
 I
 think


I
 think
 it's
 between
 60
 and
 70%
 of


active
 sports
 betterers
 are
 actually


actively
 involved
 in
 trading
 markets
 and


crypto.
 So
 just
 by
 bringing
 this
 one


piece
 in
 the
 overlap
 to
 all
 the
 other


businesses
 just
 on
 that
 alone
 was
 just


hello
 it
 makes
 perfect
 sense.
 Not
 to


mention
 if
 they
 did
 happen
 to
 get
 just
 a


little
 piece
 of
 that
 giant
 pie
 which
 is


giant
 um
 like
 that
 could
 actually
 become


a
 really
 big
 business.
 And
 sure
 enough,


you
 know,
 with
 the
 help
 of
 the
 community


and
 and
 Juan
 and
 whoever
 who's
 tracking,


right,
 he
 tags
 us
 all
 and
 like
 we
 see


these
 contracts
 going
 up,
 it's
 become
 a


massive
 business
 that
 was,
 I
 think,
 just


kind
 of
 discounted
 um
 by
 by
 major


analysts
 at
 the
 time,
 like
 not
 really


knowing
 how
 big
 the
 business
 can
 really


be.
 And
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 I'm
 looking
 at


like
 this
 is
 not
 even
 I
 don't
 look
 at
 it


as
 Robin
 Hood
 going
 out
 to
 try
 and


disrupt
 a
 sports
 betting
 industry,
 quite


frankly.
 I
 I
 mean,
 we
 know
 that
 Robin


Hood's
 going
 out
 to
 disrupt
 the


financial
 system
 as
 a
 whole.
 And
 they


kind
 of
 just
 ran
 into
 a
 contract


vehicle,
 a
 vehicle
 to
 possibly
 do
 this


that
 has
 this
 massive
 overlap,
 an
 easy


play
 from
 a
 business
 perspective
 to
 to


bring
 in
 net
 new
 consumers,
 a
 brand
 new


line
 of
 business
 that
 is
 not
 in


anybody's
 bingo
 card
 in
 terms
 of
 what's


going
 to
 get
 them
 to,
 you
 know,
 a


trillion
 dollars
 or
 whatever.
 And
 it's


just
 a
 bolt-on
 boom.
 Can
 this
 be
 a
 real


annual
 re
 revenue
 driver
 that
 is
 just


it's
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 what's
 the
 opposite


of
 a
 black
 swan?
 It's
 like
 it


>> white
 swan


>> a
 white
 swan.
 It's
 like
 a
 white
 swan


like
 oh
 okay
 bright
 sh
 and
 and
 now
 now


here
 we
 are
 and
 we're
 seeing
 we're


seeing
 the
 the
 massive
 amount
 of


adoption


to
 this
 day.
 I
 still
 don't
 think
 that


they're
 they're
 they're
 never
 going
 to


be
 like
 a
 DraftKings.
 And
 I
 can
 look


across
 the
 market
 and
 say,
 "Okay,
 well,


the
 DraftKings
 sell
 off
 is
 probably
 a


little
 overdone
 because
 it's
 it's
 not


like
 Robin's
 going
 after
 them,
 per
 se,


but
 with
 the
 amount
 of
 reach
 and
 and


other
 things
 that
 they
 can
 do."
 And
 you


you
 look
 at
 Vlad's
 tweets
 and
 things


like
 that,
 he
 still
 wants
 to
 broaden
 the


horizon
 of
 what
 event
 contracts
 can
 be.


Um,
 but
 just
 this
 alone
 when
 you
 when


you
 run
 the
 numbers
 out
 and
 you
 just


look
 at
 just
 the
 NFL
 season
 alone,
 just


this
 one
 football
 sport
 in
 America,
 not


even
 just
 America,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 multi-


trillion
 dollar
 season.
 And
 and
 that


season
 is
 September
 to
 February,
 which


by
 the
 way,
 Hood
 as
 a
 fintech
 is
 a
 very


seasonal
 can
 be
 a
 very
 seasonal
 company


that
 pulls
 that
 seasonality
 kind
 of
 out


of
 the
 box
 for
 them.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 when
 DraftKings
 came


public,
 you
 can
 look
 at
 this
 initially,


the
 ramp
 is
 so
 heavy
 in
 September
 to


January,
 that
 that
 takes
 away
 a
 lot
 of


that
 seasonality
 within
 the
 stock
 itself


because
 just
 that
 one
 component
 of
 the


business.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


massive
 it's
 it
 could
 be
 a
 massive,
 you


know,
 brand
 new
 line
 of
 business
 that


was
 not
 on
 anybody's
 radar
 that's
 just


going
 to
 go
 straight
 to
 the
 bottom
 line


because
 we
 are
 literally
 talking
 about,


I
 don't know,
 90%
 margins.
 um
 not


nothing
 but
 definitely
 mar
 90%
 margins.


Sorry,
 I'm
 going
 on
 a
 tangent,
 but
 when


you
 look
 at
 the
 the
 NFL
 ramp
 from
 now
 to


the
 quarterfinals
 to
 the
 semi
 to
 to
 the


championships
 to
 the
 Super
 Bowl,
 we
 have


barely
 started.
 And
 what
 if
 you're


actually
 counting
 the
 contracts,
 we're


week
 six,
 16
 weeks
 of
 regular,
 it
 just


gets
 bigger
 from
 here.
 It
 just
 gets


bigger
 from
 here.
 And
 it
 gets
 massively


bigger
 from
 here
 cuz
 by
 the
 time
 we
 get


to
 the
 quarterfinals,
 it's
 it's
 giant.


Um,
 and
 by
 the
 end
 of
 this
 year,
 yeah,
 I


would
 I
 would
 put
 the
 numbers
 at
 like
 a


quarter
 billion
 dollars.
 Um,
 just
 on
 the


Super
 Bowl
 ramp.
 And
 then
 you
 include


the
 other
 like
 college
 football,
 MLB,


NHL,
 and
 everything
 else
 that
 they're


trying
 to
 do.
 I'm
 like,
 "Okay,
 this
 was


not
 in
 this
 was
 not
 in
 any
 metric.
 It's


a
 big
 deal."
 Um,


yeah.
 And
 it's
 just
 to
 the
 bottom
 line.


>> What
 What
 did
 you
 mean
 by
 it
 helps
 with


seasonality?
 Wouldn't
 Wouldn't
 that
 make


Robin
 Hood
 more
 of
 a
 a
 seasonal


business?


>> No,
 because
 it's
 not
 their
 core


business,
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 ever


going
 to
 be
 their
 core
 business.
 So,
 it


would
 kind
 of
 offset
 their
 core


business.
 So,
 in
 terms
 of
 trading,
 like


the
 market
 itself
 is
 typically
 seasonal.


So
 the
 market
 itself,
 I
 think
 Robin
 Hood


needs
 net
 inflows
 generally
 speaking
 and


usually


seasonally
 September
 is
 like
 a
 bloody


month
 usually
 annually.
 I
 think
 we
 could


all
 kind
 of
 agree
 to
 that.
 And
 that's


the
 seasonality
 that
 I'm
 talking
 about


possibly
 offsetting
 because
 in
 the
 month


of
 September,
 Robin
 Hood
 from
 here
 on
 in


perpetuity
 will
 have
 a
 brand
 new
 line
 of


business
 that
 none
 of
 these
 other


financial
 companies
 have
 that's
 just


going
 to
 boom
 offset
 to
 the
 bottom
 line


that
 you'll
 always
 have
 to
 think
 about


if
 as
 a
 as
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 an
 extra


buffer,
 an
 extra
 cushion
 forever
 as
 long


as
 they're
 in
 this
 business
 that'll
 kind


of
 start,
 you
 know,
 hopefully
 hold
 them


afloat.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 more
 than
 cyclical


I
 can
 see
 some
 of
 that
 too.
 But
 u
 I
 I
 I


think
 or
 rather
 than
 seasonality
 I
 think


it's
 cyclicality
 that
 it
 really
 helps


them
 with
 because
 if
 markets
 are
 going


down
 and
 it's
 you
 know
 if
 it's
 a


recessionary
 period
 I
 I
 don't
 love
 this


but
 people
 still
 tend
 to
 bet
 although


they
 still
 may
 bet
 less
 as
 well
 and
 so
 I


think
 it
 eases
 some
 of
 that
 cyclicality.


There
 is
 some
 seasonal
 aspect
 too
 but


yeah
 it's
 and
 the
 other
 piece
 too
 Jason


I
 love
 the
 way
 that
 you
 captured
 this


too.
 Uh,
 and
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 as
 far
 as
 you


are
 as
 far
 as
 seeing
 this.
 It's
 a
 big


revenue
 driver.
 Massive.
 I'm
 probably


not
 quite
 as
 bullish
 as
 you're
 on
 that.


Uh,
 and
 then
 we
 need
 to
 get
 Tanner
 and


Amit
 closer
 to
 where
 I'm
 at
 uh,
 today


hopefully.
 But,
 um,
 it's
 it's
 exciting


that
 this
 didn't
 exist
 a
 year
 ago.
 And


it's
 just
 showcasing
 what
 Robin
 is
 able


to
 put
 out
 at
 scale.
 Uh,
 that
 they're


able
 to
 take
 something
 that
 didn't
 exist


at
 all,
 expand
 their
 TAM,
 and
 then


capture
 that
 TAM
 in
 a
 very
 short
 amount


of
 time.
 and
 this
 is
 like
 one
 of
 their


most
 successful
 ventures
 in
 that.


>> So
 that
 that
 gets
 into
 the
 analysis
 that


Roy
 you
 posted
 about
 today.
 Uh
 Robin


Hood's
 head
 of
 futures
 said,
 "We
 as
 a


firm
 are
 going
 to
 be
 looking
 to
 see
 if


there
 is
 an
 acquisition
 that's


available,
 specifically
 an
 acquisition


for
 prediction
 markets."
 So
 this
 is
 an


official
 quote.
 They
 told
 Reuters,
 "Hey,


we
 are
 in
 the
 market
 to
 buy
 more
 of


these
 platforms."
 Roy,
 you
 did
 some


analysis
 right
 here
 on
 this
 post
 on
 what


could
 be
 the
 best
 platform.
 Any
 thoughts


on
 who
 Robin
 Hood
 should
 go
 after?
 Uh


yeah,
 I
 mean
 like
 it's
 if
 price
 if
 price


wasn't
 a
 factor
 at
 all,
 it'd
 be
 Kelsey


almost
 certainly
 except
 for
 possibly


regulation.
 Kelsey
 just
 launched


internationally.
 Koshi
 backends
 most
 of


what
 they
 do
 on
 the
 predictions
 market


side
 as
 well
 and
 they
 seem
 like
 a
 good


cultural
 fit.
 They're
 growing
 incredibly


rapidly
 to
 the
 point
 where
 they're


actually
 I
 kind
 of
 wish
 they
 flipped


those
 two
 colors
 because
 Koshi's
 more


like
 needs
 the
 Robin
 Hood
 color
 there.


But
 regardless,
 they've
 overtaken
 Poly


Market
 in
 volume.
 Of
 course,
 most
 of
 it


is
 on
 the
 sports
 side.
 Poly
 market
 is


more
 international.
 It's
 not
 in
 the


United
 States
 at
 all,
 but
 they
 have
 a


massive
 leadership
 edge
 where
 it
 comes


to
 non-sports
 related
 markets.
 And
 so
 if


you
 look
 at
 that
 next
 chart,
 it
 kind
 of


shows
 what
 Poly
 Market
 does
 X
 out
 of


sports.
 So
 probably
 one
 of
 these
 two.


The
 problem
 is
 Poly
 Market
 actually
 has


even
 larger
 valuations.
 So
 I
 think


Calcium
 makes
 more
 sense.
 Uh
 plus


there's
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 regulator


scrutiny
 towards
 Poly
 Market.
 Although


they
 are
 more
 established


internationally.
 Um
 they
 don't
 already


back
 in
 and
 have
 this
 partnership
 to


you.
 Uh
 but
 regardless,
 like
 they
 don't


have
 that
 much
 cash
 on
 the
 balance


sheet,
 they
 can
 dip
 into
 the
 the
 debt


market
 or
 they
 can
 issue
 shares
 to
 pull


this
 off.
 It
 would
 be
 a
 little
 atypical


because
 most
 of
 the
 acquisitions
 that


Robin
 Hood
 does
 are
 significantly


smaller
 than
 they
 are.
 Now,
 this
 still


would
 be
 significantly
 smaller
 in
 terms


of
 market
 cap.
 So,
 you
 know,
 there's
 not


really
 an
 issue
 there.
 It's
 just
 it's
 a


larger
 um
 and
 maybe
 it's
 a
 time
 to
 do


that,
 but
 it's
 a
 a
 larger
 u
 focus.


There's
 a
 ton
 of
 startups
 out
 there,


too.
 talking
 about
 two
 of
 them
 in


particular
 and
 then
 there's
 kind
 of
 a


one
 that's
 in
 between
 that's
 focused
 on


more
 shorterd
 dated
 prediction


marketplace
 there
 will
 be
 more
 and
 more


entrance
 as
 well
 but
 yeah
 I
 would
 say


Kelshi
 or
 probably
 a
 very
 small
 startup


would
 make
 the
 most
 sense
 for
 them
 to


acquire


>> yeah
 Kelchi's
 pretty
 uh
 comparatively
 to


the
 acquisitions
 that
 they
 have
 done


it's
 expensive
 but
 compared
 to
 the
 size


that
 you
 know
 um
 Robin
 Hood
 is
 now
 they


can
 acquire
 them
 like
 it
 would
 it
 would


fit
 nicely
 in.
 But
 yeah,
 curious
 name


>> acquired
 though.


>> Maybe
 not.
 Maybe
 not.
 But
 also
 like
 a


star
 team
 like
 Vlad,
 maybe
 you
 do
 want


that
 that
 customer
 base
 to
 be
 with,


you
 know,
 get
 your
 stock
 in
 in
 hood


stock.


>> It
 is
 weird
 though,
 right?
 Because


Robin,
 Piper
 Sano
 said
 Robin
 Hood
 might


be
 25
 to
 35%
 of
 Koshi's
 volumes
 every


day.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that
 was
 the
 stat.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 if
 even
 if
 they
 bought
 Kali


though,
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 that's
 such
 a


good
 thing.
 I
 mean,
 the
 way
 that
 they


have
 it
 right
 now
 is
 just
 a
 I
 mean,
 it's


a
 it's
 a
 beautiful
 setup.
 There's
 not


really
 any
 cost
 to
 them
 and
 they're
 not


taking


>> they
 would
 get
 double
 the
 revenues
 is


because
 they
 wouldn't
 have
 to
 split
 the


scent.


>> They
 would
 get
 double
 the
 revenue,
 but


they
 would
 also
 assume
 a
 lot
 of
 risk,


which,
 you
 know,
 that's
 true.


>> Do
 we
 need
 do
 we
 is
 Robin
 Hood
 really


trying
 to
 take
 over
 spread
 betting
 and


and
 things
 like
 that?
 I
 don't
 know.
 like


being
 a
 being
 a
 sports
 book
 themselves.


If
 it's
 easy,
 it
 makes
 sense.
 But


>> well,
 clearly
 they
 do
 want
 to
 I
 mean,
 if


they're
 looking
 at
 acquisitions,
 they


they
 do
 want
 that
 risk.


>> I
 here's
 the
 question,
 Tanner.
 Why
 do


you
 think
 they
 gave
 this
 quote
 so


explicitly
 that
 we're
 looking
 to


acquire?
 I
 mean,
 I
 feel
 like
 there's


some
 logic
 behind
 them
 saying
 this.
 It's


almost
 like
 they
 want
 to
 go
 after


DraftKings
 entirely.


>> Yeah.
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 sure
 about
 why.
 I


think
 that
 um
 they
 just
 haven't,
 you


know,
 Hood's
 not
 been
 a
 closed
 book
 too


often
 or
 or
 Vlad.
 I
 mean,
 um
 they're


okay
 with
 saying
 what
 their
 plans
 are


and
 then
 going
 after
 it
 and
 still


beating
 their
 competition
 there.
 So,
 um


I
 think
 that's
 just
 their
 confidence,


but
 prediction
 markets,
 and
 you
 can
 see


it
 in
 Vlad's
 tweets,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be


a
 big
 part
 of
 the
 company.
 They
 are


constantly
 talking
 about
 prediction


markets.


um
 you
 know,
 whether
 it's
 gambling
 or
 or


what
 have
 you.
 But
 I
 I
 I
 find
 the
 sports


betting
 stuff
 really
 quickly.
 Uh
 I


wanted
 to
 point
 you
 guys
 over
 to
 Poly


Markets
 uh
 platform
 here.
 If
 Vlad
 ever


puts
 out
 something
 like
 this,
 I'm


telling
 you
 guys,
 I
 would
 use
 this


constantly.


Poly
 Market
 earnings
 calendar
 and
 they


have,
 you
 know,
 projected
 EPS.
 So
 JP


Morgan's
 going
 to
 get
 $4.72
 of
 GAP
 EPS.


There's
 a
 92%
 chance
 that
 they
 beat
 on


earnings.


>> That's
 awesome.


>> The
 problem
 was
 can
 can
 Robin
 Hood
 give


people
 the
 ability
 to
 bet
 on
 companies


given
 how
 regulated
 they
 are?


>> I
 don't
 see
 why
 not.


>> I
 don't
 know
 that
 you
 can
 bet
 on
 Fed


results
 and
 economic
 results.


Yeah,
 I
 saw
 this
 Tanner
 too
 and
 I
 was


like,
 okay,
 so
 if
 Robin
 Hood
 goes
 here,


this
 is
 a
 big
 deal.
 And
 maybe
 it's
 a


maybe
 they
 put
 that
 post
 out
 because


that's
 not
 where
 Khi
 necessarily
 wants


to
 go
 or
 I
 would
 assume
 that
 that's
 not


necessarily
 what
 Khi
 wants
 to
 go,
 but
 it


probably
 is
 where
 where
 Vlad
 would
 want


to
 go
 longer
 term.
 Um


>> yeah,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know what
 the
 odds


would
 be
 to
 put
 like
 what's
 the
 chances


that
 Hood
 beats
 earnings
 or
 SoFi
 beats


earnings,
 but
 I
 would
 love
 to
 bet
 on


that
 because
 to
 me
 it's
 not
 a
 5050
 roll


of
 the
 dice,
 you
 know?
 like
 I
 feel
 like


I
 would
 have
 an
 information
 advantage.


>> Yeah.
 The
 the
 hard
 thing
 right
 now
 is
 if


you're
 going
 to
 predict
 that
 just
 using,


you
 know,
 stocks
 or
 uh
 options,
 you
 have


to
 be
 right
 twice.
 You
 have
 to
 be
 right


on
 them
 actually
 beating
 and
 also
 on
 the


stock
 going
 the
 direction
 or
 or
 missing


and
 and
 right
 on
 the
 stock
 direction
 as


well.
 That's
 a
 harder
 setup
 than
 just


okay,
 EPS,
 I
 know
 this
 company
 well.


Yeah,
 they're
 going
 to
 blow
 that
 out
 of


the
 water.
 uh
 which
 happens
 a
 lot
 a
 lot


more
 than
 you
 guys
 think


>> which
 is
 actually
 really
 interesting
 to


look
 at
 that
 uh
 because
 you
 know
 the
 the


whole
 um
 wisdom
 of
 the
 crowd
 phenomenon.


Of
 course
 when
 you
 have
 larger
 volume
 uh


it's
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 different
 setup


because
 other
 people
 can
 see
 what
 other


people
 are
 predicting
 and
 see
 what
 the


spread
 is
 there.
 But
 uh
 you
 know
 that


can
 actually
 be
 very
 valuable
 as


somebody
 that's
 looking
 at
 to
 a
 stock


you're
 like
 okay
 I've
 got
 a
 lot
 of


shares
 and
 why
 is
 92%
 prediction
 uh


saying
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 miss
 on


EPS?
 Okay,
 there's
 something
 I
 might
 be


missing.
 I
 need
 to
 look
 into
 this.


>> Right.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 uh
 the
 EPS
 seems
 to
 get


locked
 in
 when
 whatever
 the
 average
 was


whenever
 they
 created
 the
 um
 the


prediction.
 So
 that
 can
 change
 a
 lot.


For
 example,
 JP
 Morgans's
 whenever
 they


opened
 up
 the
 prediction
 was
 $4.72.
 I


think
 if
 you
 check
 now,
 Wall
 Street's
 at


like
 492.
 So
 even
 the
 prediction
 from


Wall
 Street's
 like
 20
 cents
 higher
 than


what
 the
 prediction
 market
 is
 at.
 So
 if


you
 had
 conviction
 early,
 I'm
 sure
 the


pred
 the
 the
 prediction
 has
 already


increased
 a
 lot
 just
 going
 into


earnings.
 But
 for
 a
 company
 like
 Sovi


that's
 beaten
 earnings
 every
 single


time.


>> Yeah.


>> If
 you
 put
 a
 90%
 chance
 and
 I
 can
 make


10%
 on
 that
 day
 cash
 out,
 I
 mean,
 I'm


probably
 not
 going
 to
 see
 that
 type
 of


rate
 on
 SoFi
 stock
 in
 general.


>> That
 was
 honestly
 the
 ticker
 that
 I
 was


thinking
 of.
 I'm
 like,
 it's
 he's


thinking
 SoFi
 right
 now.
 I
 can
 tell
 the


the
 wheels
 are
 spinning
 in
 your
 brain


because
 I
 mean
 they
 do
 always
 beat.
 So


yeah,
 there
 are
 some
 companies
 like
 that


too
 that
 consistently
 do
 that
 are


underappreciated
 by
 the
 market
 over
 long


stretches
 of
 time
 which
 I
 mean
 that
 to


case
 in
 point
 like
 even
 outside
 of
 this


specific
 product
 in
 the
 predictions


market
 there
 are
 different
 markets
 out


there
 than
 what
 I'm
 in
 there
 where


people
 can
 have
 like
 Jason
 a
 real
 edge.


Jason,
 you
 made
 a
 great
 call
 on
 one
 of


the
 two
 Monday
 night
 football
 games.
 I


don't
 know
 how
 that's
 played
 out
 since
 I


looked
 there
 recently,
 but
 you
 know,


like


>> we're
 winning.


>> All
 right.
 Well,
 there's
 people
 that


know
 that
 area
 like
 at
 the
 on
 the
 back


of
 their
 hands
 and
 they're
 like,
 "Oh,


yeah.
 Historically,
 they
 go
 into
 this


and
 they
 don't
 play
 well
 in
 snowlight."


You
 know,
 all
 these
 different
 things
 and


they're
 like,
 "Hey,
 the
 markets
 got
 this


wrong.
 Let
 me
 predict
 on
 that."
 Uh,
 and


and
 same
 with
 stock.
 So,
 it's


interesting.


What
 was
 funny
 is
 like
 imagine
 what


happened
 whenever
 that
 upstart
 report


came
 out
 and
 all
 those
 lenders
 ended
 up


falling.
 Like
 what
 happens
 during
 those


times
 to
 the
 prediction
 market
 side?


Massive
 crashes
 in
 people's
 expectations


of
 beating
 earnings
 and
 then
 it
 all


turned
 out
 to
 be
 fake.


>> Yeah.


>> Like
 that's
 why
 I
 like
 the
 live
 live


prediction
 markets.
 It
 would
 be
 a
 lot
 of


fun.


>> So
 we
 all
 agree
 prediction
 markets
 is


like
 a
 really
 big
 catalyst
 for
 growth.


>> Biased
 panel.
 Yeah.


>> Mhm.


Yeah,
 that
 was
 not
 that.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 part
 of
 what
 made
 the
 stock
 go
 up


recently
 too,
 right?
 Because


>> yeah,


>> how
 do
 you
 value
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you


value
 this
 and
 what
 kind
 of
 multiple


does
 that
 add
 to
 the
 stock
 and
 then


where
 does
 that
 put
 them
 moving
 forward?


And
 I
 think
 that's
 part
 of
 what
 maybe


drove
 the
 market
 recently
 ahead
 of


earnings
 is
 there
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 just


kind
 of
 fumbling
 over
 the
 situation


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 well


what
 does
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 for
 Robin


Hood
 the
 equity
 and
 where
 should
 that


where
 where
 should
 that
 land
 the
 stock


price
 today?


>> Okay.


So
 I
 guess
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 the
 uh


prediction
 markets
 ultimately
 ramp
 up.


By
 the
 way,
 we
 have
 earnings
 on
 November


5th,
 folks.
 So,
 uh,
 we'll
 be
 live
 on


November
 5th
 after
 hours
 and
 think


Street's
 expecting
 now
 almost
 1.2


billion.
 So,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of


their
 best
 quarters
 ever.
 And
 if
 they


can
 beat
 that,
 that
 would
 definitely


help.


>> You're
 winning.


>> We
 are
 winning.


>> We're
 winning
 on
 all
 the
 spreads.


>> So,
 Hood
 was
 153
 on
 Friday,
 fell
 all
 the


way
 to
 130.
 Now,
 it's
 back
 to
 140.
 Um,
 I


guess
 some
 general
 thoughts
 about


um
 the
 sell-off,
 Tanner.
 How
 did
 you


navigate
 a
 3%
 down
 day
 for
 the
 first


time
 in
 6
 months?


>> Uh
 held


um
 I
 bought
 some
 stock,
 not
 not
 hood
 or


anything.
 I
 ended
 up
 buying
 a
 lot
 of
 BMR


on
 Friday
 and
 then
 Friday
 in
 the
 after


hours.
 Um
 Ethereum
 and
 and
 crypto
 just


saw
 such
 an
 overexaggerated
 pullback


that
 I
 think
 um
 taking
 advantage
 of
 that


was,
 you
 know,
 the
 best
 thing
 to
 do
 if


possible.
 And
 uh
 I
 had
 a
 really
 good


hunch
 that
 that
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 taco


event.
 Um
 you
 know,
 we've
 seen
 him
 do


this
 10
 times,
 15
 times,
 these


unbelievably
 exaggerated


um


you
 know,
 like
 threats
 of
 of
 large


tariffs
 to
 China
 or
 other
 countries.
 And


usually
 the
 market
 is
 okay
 a
 week
 from


now,
 you
 know.
 Um,
 so
 it
 happened


quicker
 than
 I
 thought
 that
 things
 ended


up
 repairing.
 We
 didn't
 even
 need
 a


meeting.
 But
 yeah,
 it
 everything
 went


back
 to
 normal
 and
 Donald
 Trump
 once


again
 he
 he
 can
 in
 one
 hand
 say,
 you


know,
 extremely
 disrespectful.
 How
 could


X
 do
 this?
 Like,
 you
 know,
 the
 guy's
 a


little
 worm.
 And
 then
 the
 next
 day
 Ges,


oh
 yeah,
 sorry,
 my
 opinion.
 He
 goes,


"I've
 got
 the
 most
 respect
 for
 Xi.
 Love


Xi,
 you
 know,
 great
 great
 leader."
 So,
 I


had
 a
 feeling
 this
 was
 going
 to
 go
 uh


turn
 around
 and
 everything
 was
 going
 to


be
 fine
 and
 hopefully
 people
 didn't


freak
 out
 and
 dump
 their
 positions


unless
 of
 course
 Binance
 or
 something


else
 dumped
 your
 position
 for
 you
 and


which
 I'm
 sorry,
 but
 yeah.


>> Uh
 Jason,
 your
 take
 and
 did
 you
 buy


anything
 in
 this?


>> Um
 I
 was
 actually


I
 thought
 it
 was
 going
 to
 come.
 We
 were


talking
 about
 it
 maybe
 like
 a
 week


before
 that.
 And
 so
 I
 was
 I
 was
 prepared


for
 it
 to
 happen
 when
 we
 got
 that
 first


3,700
 dip
 on
 Ethereum.


This
 last
 one
 I
 didn't
 have
 my
 orders


resting.
 And
 I
 and
 I'm
 very
 old
 school


crypto.
 Like
 very
 old
 school
 crypto.
 So


like
 really
 the
 only
 times
 I
 really
 I


think
 about
 buying
 is
 during
 these
 kind


of
 flash
 crashes.
 Literally
 this
 is
 it.


But
 to
 me,
 it's
 like
 I
 need
 to
 have
 my


orders
 out
 there
 already
 beforehand


resting
 because
 these
 things
 happen
 so


fast.
 It's
 not
 like
 regular
 markets.


There's
 no
 circuit
 breakers
 that
 are


going
 to
 save
 you.
 And
 and
 they're
 so


fast
 that
 they're
 basically
 just


liquidity
 of
 liquidity
 events
 of
 people


getting
 liquidated
 on
 their
 futures.
 now


um
 that
 if
 you're
 not
 if
 you
 don't
 have


something
 there
 waiting
 at
 the
 ready
 to


pick
 up
 at
 a
 very
 steep
 discount
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 night,
 you're
 probably
 not


going
 to
 get
 filled
 because
 you
 will
 try


to
 chase
 it.
 And
 I
 think
 if
 that's
 is
 if


that
 was
 the
 comment
 about
 Robin
 Hood,


that
 is
 that
 is
 if
 that's
 what
 it
 was,


that's
 just
 normal.
 So
 that's
 dumb
 for


that
 to
 be
 a
 comment.
 That's
 how
 crypto


works.
 That's
 how
 it's
 always
 worked


since
 the
 very
 beginning.
 This
 is
 it's


the
 raw
 crypto
 is
 the
 rawest
 form
 of


supply
 and
 demand
 that
 you
 can
 find.
 And


so,
 um,
 from
 from
 that
 perspective,


yeah,
 you
 have
 to
 play
 it
 differently.


Um,
 did
 you
 guys
 get
 it?
 Like,
 did
 you


have
 any
 resting
 orders?
 Cuz
 I
 saw
 some


of
 my
 I
 was
 I
 was
 a
 little
 butt
 hurt,


man.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 lie.
 I
 threw
 them


out
 there.
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 missed
 it.
 I'm


bummed.
 Um,
 but
 no,
 the
 only
 thing
 I


bought
 was
 BMR


uh
 and
 an
 SMCI
 and
 I
 just
 did
 my
 my


daily
 DCA
 of
 Hood.
 But,
 um,
 but
 that's


that's
 basically
 it.
 Like
 BMR
 hit
 our


our
 levels
 that
 we've
 been
 watching
 like


that
 43ish.
 I
 think
 BMR
 I
 should
 have


waited
 after
 hours
 because
 that
 was
 a


really
 good
 pickup
 if
 you
 waited
 till


after
 the
 market
 was
 closed.
 And
 that's


interestingly
 how
 crypto
 works
 too.
 So


maybe
 moving
 forward
 I'll
 just
 wait
 till


after
 the
 market
 closes
 and
 get
 it
 after


hours


>> cuz
 that
 was
 a
 really
 good
 pickup.
 I


mean
 couple
 extra
 bucks
 but
 I
 think
 it


was
 like
 30
 like
 like
 not
 30
 it
 was
 it


was


>> I
 know
 I
 think
 the
 lowest
 I
 got
 to
 was


47
 I
 think.


>> 47.
 Yeah
 it
 was
 deep.
 I
 almost
 said
 37.


So
 47.
 It
 was
 it
 was
 it
 was
 down
 pretty


heavy
 but
 that
 was
 that
 was
 the
 discount


to
 me.
 Um,
 I
 bought
 a
 little
 China


exposure,
 not
 gonna
 lie,
 actually.
 So,
 I


did
 that,
 too.
 Um,


hopped
 in
 for
 the
 JD
 run
 into
 singles


day
 for
 111.


>> How
 did
 that
 work
 out?
 I
 I
 didn't
 even


keep
 an
 eye
 on
 Chinese
 stocks
 throughout


this
 last
 period.


>> So,
 so
 for
 you,
 it
 sounds
 like
 it
 was
 a


pretty
 easy
 dip
 by
 for
 active
 traders.


It's
 it
 wasn't
 that
 easy.
 It
 was
 a
 very


scary
 kind
 of
 dip
 by.
 And
 if
 if
 a
 lot
 of


people
 intraday
 Friday,
 freaky
 Friday,


it
 like
 they
 might
 have
 tried
 to
 jump
 in


early
 around
 the
 lunch
 hour
 or


something,
 which
 is
 normally
 you
 would


think
 you
 would
 think
 that
 normally
 by


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 things
 start
 to
 turn


around.
 But
 on
 a
 Friday,
 especially
 in
 a


in
 a
 bull
 market,
 what's
 weird
 about


Fridays
 in
 bull
 markets
 is
 that
 they


tend
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 profit
 taking
 and


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 might
 not


be
 there.
 So
 low
 liquidity
 environment,


Friday
 in
 a
 bull
 market,
 you
 have
 profit


taking
 going
 on,
 it
 could
 things
 can
 get


out
 of
 control.
 And
 we
 were
 so
 used
 to


seeing
 that
 the
 dip
 buyer
 show
 up
 late


day.
 There
 was
 no
 dip
 buyers
 in
 sights


like
 not
 until
 like
 like
 not
 even
 to
 the


bell.
 There
 were
 no
 dip
 buyers
 in
 sight.


So
 they
 must
 have
 shown
 up
 after
 hours.


So
 intraday
 it
 might
 have
 been
 a
 little


scary.
 I
 did
 anyways,
 but
 I
 I
 absolutely


waited
 till
 the
 till
 the
 till
 the
 bell


hit.
 Um
 because
 I
 needed
 to
 like
 it
 was


either
 wait
 till
 the
 bell
 or
 I
 see
 some


signs
 of
 life,
 but
 the
 dip
 buyers
 were


nowhere
 to
 be
 found
 intraday
 on
 Friday.


Um
 oddly
 enough,
 and
 then
 of
 course
 we


get
 the
 don't
 worry
 about
 China.
 She


just
 had
 a
 bad
 moment
 uh
 tweet
 and
 and


here
 we
 are,
 which
 oddly
 sets
 us
 up


better
 for
 earnings
 anyways.
 So,
 I'm
 I'm


actually
 kind
 of
 happy
 about
 that.


>> Roy,
 what
 did
 you
 do
 on
 this
 3%
 down


day?


>> Ah,
 you're
 muted.


>> Always
 muted
 this
 guy.


>> Yeah,
 I
 ended
 up
 rebying
 my
 covered


calls
 uh
 which
 was
 uh
 on
 Robin
 Hood,


which
 had
 ran.
 I
 had
 some
 that
 were
 fine


that
 were
 not
 going
 to
 get
 hit.
 I
 had


some
 I
 think
 at
 142
 and
 some
 at
 140.
 And


I
 saw
 this
 as
 an
 opportunity.
 I
 didn't


do
 what
 I
 did
 before
 on
 names,
 waiting


like
 for
 it
 to
 go
 all
 the
 way
 under.
 I'm


like,
 "Hey,
 I'll
 take
 the
 lump
 for
 for


that
 uh
 lot
 and
 be
 happy
 to
 get
 out
 of


that
 exposure."
 Uh
 I
 bought
 more
 BMR.
 Uh


I
 bought
 more
 Ethereum,
 although
 there


were
 problems
 with
 that.
 Uh
 but
 I
 waited


over
 the
 weekend,
 so
 I
 didn't
 get
 the


best
 uh
 fill
 on
 that
 versus
 like
 the


massive
 dip.
 And
 uh
 because
 it's


Columbus
 Day,
 some
 things
 didn't
 settle,


which
 is
 not
 unexpected.
 Um,
 so
 that'll


show
 up
 tomorrow.
 So,
 I'll
 probably
 add


a
 little bit
 of
 p
 uh
 PayPal
 here,
 too.


[Music]


>> So,
 it
 seems
 like
 all
 of
 us
 bought
 the


dip.


>> I
 I
 I
 think
 Roy
 just
 put
 a
 little
 Do
 we


drink
 on
 the
 show,
 by
 the
 way?
 Is
 that
 a


Matt
 told
 me
 to
 bring
 beers,
 but
 I
 don't


know.


>> Yeah,
 we
 drink.
 We
 all
 drink.
 I
 had
 mine


before
 the
 show.
 Your
 turn.


>> We
 don't
 drink
 on
 the
 show,
 but
 you
 are


welcome
 to
 drink.


Um,
 but
 uh
 I
 I
 think
 you
 brought
 up
 a
 a


good
 point,
 Roy,
 that
 maybe
 people


aren't
 um
 thinking
 about,
 but
 today
 was


a
 bank
 holiday
 technically,
 and
 there


was
 a
 lot
 of
 funds
 that
 didn't
 clear.


So,
 anybody
 that
 sold
 Friday
 didn't
 have


their
 funds
 freed
 necessarily
 today
 to


buy
 the
 dip.
 So,
 tomorrow


can
 get
 even
 more
 interesting,
 believe


it
 or
 not.
 So,
 I'm
 I'm
 very
 interested


to
 see
 that.


>> Dude,
 is
 Steve
 in
 the
 chat?
 Because


he'll
 he
 probably
 has
 some
 milk.


>> He's
 probably
 drinking
 some
 milk.
 Steve,


if
 you're
 drinking
 some
 milk.


>> I
 saw
 him
 I
 saw
 him
 lurking
 earlier.


>> Put
 a
 milk
 emoji
 in
 the
 chat.
 This
 man


is
 starting
 every
 video
 with
 an
 ice
 cold


glass
 of
 milk.


>> It's
 beyond
 funny.


>> He'll
 start
 a
 live
 stream.
 Go,
 ladies


and
 gentlemen,
 I'm
 starting
 out
 with


strawberry
 uh
 yogurt
 today.


>> There
 he
 is.
 Milk
 for
 life.
 He
 talks


about
 his
 flavor
 of
 the
 day.


>> Stream.
 We're
 gonna
 buy
 a
 bunch
 of


cookies
 and
 review
 them
 live.
 Dude,


we're
 gonna
 have
 to
 do
 it.


>> Do
 you
 guys
 like
 Does
 he
 like
 write


White
 Russians?
 That
 was
 like
 the
 milky


kind
 of


>> dude.
 You
 like
 so
 many
 types
 of
 cookies.


He's
 a
 cookie
 guy.
 I'm
 a
 cookie
 guy,


too,
 but
 I
 don't
 eat
 it
 as
 often.


>> No.
 Do
 you
 know
 what
 a
 white
 Russian
 is?


>> Yeah.
 Cookie,
 right?


Did
 it
 really?


>> I
 knew
 I
 knew
 thought
 it
 was
 a
 white


macadamia
 chip
 cookie
 or
 something.


Right.


>> Oh,
 it's
 a
 cocktail.


>> Oh,
 not
 a
 mocktail,
 but
 a
 cocktail.


>> What
 we
 need
 in
 time
 of
 that
 stream
 is


really
 prediction
 market
 on
 what
 is


going
 to
 be
 the
 best
 cookie
 cookie
 as


you
 guys
 review
 it.
 So,


>> bro,
 everyone
 in
 the
 chat's
 gonna
 tell


me
 they
 knew
 what
 a
 White
 Russian
 is.


What?


>> Everyone
 in
 the
 chat
 will.
 Everyone,


>> man.


I
 don't
 even


>> the
 miners,
 dude.
 Like


>> thought
 it
 was
 a
 freaking
 cookie,
 dude.


>> It's
 a
 tasty
 little
 beverage.


>> Thought
 it
 was
 a
 cookie,
 bro.
 We
 were


talking
 about
 cookies.
 Why
 are
 you


bringing
 up
 alcohol?


>> Oh,
 man.
 That
 might
 be
 worse.


>> He
 was
 bringing
 up
 a
 milky
 alcohol


drink.


>> It
 has
 milk.


>> Whatever,
 dude.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 a


cookie.
 Everyone
 Okay.
 Everyone
 knew
 it


was
 a
 freaking
 drug.


>> Steve,
 you
 need
 to
 go
 over
 to
 Amit's


place
 and
 bring
 some
 white
 Russians.
 And


then
 if
 he
 doesn't
 know,
 he
 needs
 to


experience


>> the
 only
 Bro,
 I
 know
 what
 a
 I
 I
 know


what
 a
 Moscow
 Moscow
 mule
 is.


>> That's
 good.
 That's
 like
 how
 I
 sound.


>> I
 I
 think
 he
 will
 like
 the
 White


Russian.
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 Atlanta's
 going


to
 win
 this
 straight
 up.
 We
 got
 two


minute
 two-minute
 warning
 coming
 up


here.
 214.


>> Emit.
 Emit.
 Well,
 your
 hands
 are
 above


and
 I
 can
 see
 them.
 Keep
 your
 hands


where
 I
 can
 see
 them.
 What's
 in
 a
 Moscow


meal?


Don't
 tell.
 Hey,
 put
 your
 hands
 above.


Show
 me
 your
 hands.


>> Name
 one
 ingredient
 of
 a
 Moscow
 mule.


>> Alcohol.


>> Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 All
 right.
 No,
 you


passed.
 You're
 good.


>> I
 think
 there's
 some
 lemon.
 It's
 like


lemon
 juice,
 right?
 That's
 what
 they


>> right.
 It's
 like
 What
 the
 [ __ ]
 is
 it?
 A


Moscow
 mule,
 bro.


>> Know
 there's
 ginger
 beer
 in
 it
 or
 else


you
 Oh,
 I
 should
 have
 known
 that.
 I


should
 have
 known
 that.
 I
 should
 have.


All
 right.
 Anyway,


>> um
 I
 knew
 this
 he
 started
 going
 like


this.
 He
 was
 going
 to
 Gemini.


>> Yeah,


>> Google
 AI
 overviews
 are
 like
 the
 best
 AI


product
 that's
 out
 there
 right
 now.
 Like


genuinely,
 we
 use
 it
 on
 the
 on
 the


market
 open
 like
 50
 times
 a
 day.
 Okay,


so
 OpenAI
 Broadcom,
 Jason,
 I'm
 gonna


give
 you
 the
 first
 word
 on
 this
 10


gigawatt
 deal.
 It
 looks
 like
 OpenAI
 is


central
 to
 every
 single
 AI
 company,
 AMD,


Nvidia,
 Oracle.
 What
 was
 your
 reaction


when
 you
 saw
 that
 deal
 this
 morning?
 Um,


I
 actually
 thought
 the
 stock
 would
 be
 up


a
 lot
 more,


believe
 it
 or
 not.
 I
 mean,
 I
 know
 it's


up
 10%
 and
 it's
 like
 150
 125
 billion


market
 cap
 increase,
 but
 you
 do
 the


math.
 Um,
 that
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 dollars.
 I


know
 it's
 a
 long-term
 thing.
 Oh,
 did
 you


put
 that?


Did
 you
 post
 how
 many
 dollars
 if
 you
 do


the
 math?


>> Uh,
 it's
 it's
 about
 300
 billion.


>> I
 had
 like
 four
 or
 five.
 Yeah.
 Um
 but
 I


mean
 over
 over
 many
 many
 years
 right
 I


think
 it
 was
 like
 five
 years
 or


something
 but
 just
 the
 same
 I
 mean
 the


chart
 I'm
 technical
 first
 for
 me
 so
 the


chart
 was
 setting
 up
 anyways
 it
 was
 a


tough
 day
 but
 I
 sold
 my
 short
 cuz
 I


didn't
 take
 it
 longterm
 I
 just
 took
 it


shortterm
 and
 I
 got
 shaken
 out
 so
 I
 was


a
 little
 bummed
 but
 happy
 to
 see
 the


trade
 like
 working
 out.


Um
 but
 this
 makes
 sense
 to
 me.
 I
 think


that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 try
 to
 go
 for
 that


400
 anyways.
 um
 if
 you
 get
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 pullback,
 I
 think
 it
 bases
 out.
 I
 I


I
 think
 this
 is
 this
 carries
 on.
 Um


we'll
 see
 once
 it
 gets
 up
 to
 that
 more


recent
 high
 that
 it
 just
 hit
 on


earnings,
 but
 I
 think
 that
 it
 makes


sense
 out
 of
 the
 gate
 and
 I
 I
 think
 that


it
 makes
 sense
 that
 it
 held
 through
 the


whole
 day.
 It
 it
 kind
 of
 gapped
 up
 and


just
 went
 sideways.
 So
 maybe
 it
 breathes


a
 little
 bit,
 but
 I
 don't
 expect
 to
 see


a
 giant
 pullback.
 It's
 a
 I
 think
 it's
 a


bigger
 deal
 than


I
 think
 it's
 a
 bigger
 deal
 than
 the


market
 initially
 understood.
 Actually,
 I


I
 I
 still
 think
 it
 might
 be
 a
 bigger


deal
 than
 the
 market
 really
 thinks
 about


thinks
 it
 is.
 So,
 um
 we'll
 hear
 what


they
 have
 to
 say
 on
 earnings,
 but


um
 but
 yeah,
 that
 deal
 was
 massive.


when
 you
 really
 look
 under
 the
 covers
 of


what
 it
 could
 potentially
 be,
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 theoretical
 like,
 oh,
 well,


that's
 so
 massive
 that
 do
 we
 even
 have


power?
 All
 those
 kind
 of
 conversations


probably
 can
 get
 brought
 into
 the
 mix.


But,
 um,


just
 on
 the
 on
 on
 the
 on
 the
 surface,
 I


would
 just
 look
 at
 it
 and
 say
 I
 I
 think


it
 could
 move
 the
 stock
 higher
 still
 to


be
 fair.


>> Uh,
 Tanner,
 we'll
 go
 to
 you
 next.
 I


mean,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 the
 the
 real


interesting
 about
 this
 thing
 is
 Oracle's


entire
 stock
 price
 has
 been
 lifted


because
 of
 OpenAI.
 AMD,
 obviously,
 that


35%
 move
 was
 because
 of
 OpenAI.
 Nvidia


didn't
 need
 OpenAI,
 but
 they
 were
 stuck


at
 170
 and
 then
 they
 got
 up
 to
 195


because
 of
 OpenAI,
 or
 at least
 at least


in
 part
 of
 OpenAI.
 And
 now
 Broadcom,
 it


wasn't
 a
 massive
 move,
 but
 10%
 is


nothing
 to
 scoff
 at.


A,
 what's
 your
 thoughts
 on
 the
 deal?
 And


then
 B,
 is
 Open
 AI
 even
 allowed
 to
 fail


anymore?


It'll
 be
 bad
 if
 they
 uh
 if
 they
 do,
 but


um
 I
 I
 think
 they'll
 do
 well.
 I've
 been


pretty
 adamant
 and
 consistent
 that
 I


think
 OpenAI
 will
 be
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


names


like
 just
 in
 in
 all,
 you
 know,
 US
 stock


history
 whenever
 they
 go
 public
 at


least,
 uh
 they'll
 be
 a
 trillion
 dollar


name
 and
 and
 they
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 service


from
 many
 many
 different
 businesses.
 So


uh
 for
 years
 now
 we've
 been
 listening
 to


Jensen
 say
 you
 know
 the
 demand
 for


compute
 is
 just
 going
 to
 be
 absolutely


exponential


explosive
 and
 now
 you're
 watching
 a


customer
 unveil
 a
 plan
 that
 is
 not


happening
 like
 these
 deals
 are


not
 even
 most
 of
 them
 don't
 even
 have


time
 limits
 on
 them.
 We
 don't
 know
 how


long
 they're
 actually
 going
 to
 be
 for


but
 they're
 setting
 up
 a
 very
 long-term


plan
 cuz
 they
 know
 that
 they're
 going
 to


need
 that
 compute.
 Um,
 I
 think
 it's


legitimate.
 I
 think
 it's
 real.
 Um,
 do
 I


buy
 more
 Nvidia?
 I
 don't
 know.
 Honestly,


I've
 been
 looking
 at
 TSM
 a
 lot
 right
 now


just
 as
 like
 a
 general
 winning
 play.


And
 if
 something
 happens
 to
 Taiwan,
 it's


not
 like
 my
 Nvidia
 gets
 out
 unscathed.
 I


mean,
 we're
 we're
 all
 doomed.
 So,
 um,


yeah,
 TSM
 looks
 looks
 really
 cheap
 and


going
 to
 be
 a
 general
 winner
 across
 the


board.
 Um,


I
 don't
 even
 remember
 your
 question.


Is
 open
 AI
 allowed
 to
 fail
 is
 sort
 of


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 they're
 of
 course
 they're


allowed
 to
 fail.
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 they


will
 though.
 Um
 I'm
 a
 big
 believer


obviously
 I
 have
 to
 be
 that
 AI
 is
 legit


and
 that
 they'll
 create
 tools
 that
 will


you
 know
 multiply
 GDP.


Roy,
 same
 question
 to
 you.


>> Uh,
 yeah,
 not
 too
 much
 to
 add
 on
 the


first
 question.
 Uh,
 beyond
 just
 I
 agree


with
 these
 guys,
 you
 know,
 just
 further


validates
 that
 AI
 is
 real
 and
 growing


and
 ramping.
 Is
 open
 AI
 allowed
 to
 fill


it
 should
 be.
 Um,
 I'm
 a
 big
 free
 market


guy.
 I
 think
 it's
 stake
 when
 the
 federal


government
 steps
 in,
 especially
 with


open
 AI.
 They're
 they're
 a
 massive


player
 lynch
 pin.
 I
 still
 think
 that


Nvidia
 is
 more
 important
 to
 the
 AI


ecosystem
 space,
 but
 all
 AI
 is
 not
 open


AI
 and
 vice
 versa,
 and
 frankly,
 it


shouldn't
 be.
 I
 don't
 I
 agree
 with


Tanner.
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 they
 will


fail.
 Um
 I
 think
 they'll
 continue
 to


grow.
 Now
 there
 it
 it's
 going
 there's


going to
 be
 es
 and
 flow
 moments
 and


their
 valuation
 may
 not
 you
 know
 it
 may


be
 expensive
 here.
 Who
 knows?
 But
 uh


they
 if
 they
 do
 fail
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a


bad
 day
 for
 everybody.
 Even
 if
 you're


not
 in
 uh
 you
 know
 private
 equity
 open


AI
 if
 you're
 not
 in
 Nvidia
 or
 anything


in
 AI
 it's
 going
 to
 hit
 the
 markets
 in
 a


massive
 uh
 significant
 way.
 So
 even
 if


you're
 in
 like
 investing
 in
 Coca-Cola


and
 dividend
 planes,
 it
 will
 still
 be
 a


bad
 day
 for
 you.
 So
 we
 better
 hope
 that


that
 doesn't
 happen.


>> Even
 whenever
 OpenAI
 came
 out
 with
 its


original
 product,
 you
 know,
 everyone


thought
 that
 there
 was
 going to
 be
 no


competitors
 because
 there
 was
 no
 other,


you
 know,
 legitimate
 LLM
 that
 was


anything
 like
 it.
 And
 then
 uh
 what
 was


the
 original?
 Bard
 ended
 up
 becoming


Gemini.
 That
 got
 really
 great.
 Grock


came
 out
 of
 nowhere,
 skyrocketed,


became
 really
 great.
 So
 even
 in
 these


next
 phases
 of
 artificial
 intelligence,


there's
 going
 to
 be
 lots
 of
 competitors.


And
 I
 think
 that
 the


um
 amount
 of
 focus
 that
 a
 company
 like


OpenAI
 is
 getting
 is
 so
 interesting


because
 I
 feel
 like
 you
 can
 make
 similar


bets
 on
 names
 like
 Google
 or
 names
 like


Amazon
 that
 are
 going
 to
 significantly


benefit
 from
 this
 AI
 craze
 and
 yet


there's
 a
 very
 minimal
 uh
 premium
 being


given
 to
 these
 names.
 So
 honestly,
 those


are
 the
 names
 that
 I'm
 acquiring
 right


now.


that
 benefit
 by
 the
 way
 as
 as
 cloud


providers
 as
 well
 as
 as
 essentially


custodians
 to
 open
 AAI
 as
 well.


Okay,
 that
 that's
 kind
 of
 my
 similar


thoughts.
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 think
 OpenAI
 is


allowed
 to
 fail.
 I
 it's
 not
 possible


anymore.
 They
 are
 they
 are
 the
 reason


for
 why
 the
 hundreds
 of
 billions
 of


dollars
 in
 market
 cap
 have
 increased


across
 the
 board.
 I
 mean,
 without
 AM


without
 this
 opening
 idea
 with
 AMD,
 AMD


is
 probably
 stuck
 at
 150,
 160.
 Without


this
 Oracle
 RPO
 growth
 on
 a
 cloud


computing
 side,
 you
 know,
 they're


probably
 stuck
 in
 the
 in
 the
 210s,
 220s.


And
 so,
 I
 do
 think
 the
 likelihood
 of


them
 succeeding
 though,
 I
 agree
 with


you,
 Tanner,
 is
 greater
 than,
 you
 know,


greater
 than
 not.
 I
 mean,
 uh,
 that
 chart


that's
 been
 going
 viral
 of
 it
 took
 the


internet
 13
 years
 to
 get
 800
 million


users
 and
 CHABT,
 it
 took
 it
 two
 and
 a


half
 years,


as
 our
 as
 our
 milkman
 says
 right
 here
 in


the
 chat,
 they're
 not
 allowed
 to
 fail.


Too
 many
 companies
 are
 tied
 to
 them,


which
 is
 actually
 kind
 of
 bullish.
 That


means
 there's
 an
 incentive
 for
 all
 these


companies
 to
 make
 sure
 it
 works.
 And
 so,


I
 guess
 the
 follow-up
 question
 then
 is,


and
 Jason
 will
 give
 it
 to
 you,
 is
 do
 you


think
 Grock
 and
 Gemini


really
 have
 a
 shot
 at
 dethroning
 them,


or
 has
 the
 industry
 decided
 Chad
 is
 the


winner?


>> Grock
 and
 Gemini.
 Um,
 I
 think
 that


well,
 first
 of
 all,
 OpenAI,
 by
 the
 way,


has
 the
 best
 CFO
 in
 the
 freaking
 valley.


So,
 like
 that
 is
 a
 big
 win.
 Having
 Sarah


on
 the
 Sarah
 Frier
 on
 the
 team
 is
 like


she's
 an
 unsung
 hero.
 But
 if
 you
 don't


know
 who
 she
 is,
 she's
 like
 the
 genius


behind
 Square,
 like
 initial
 Square
 team,


but


probably
 the
 well,
 so
 from
 the
 valley,


being
 from
 the
 valley,
 best
 CFO
 in
 the


valley.
 Um,
 but
 so
 she
 can
 make
 magic


happen
 and
 she
 is
 doing
 exactly
 what
 she


does
 best
 right
 now
 and
 that's
 what


we're
 seeing
 like
 the
 financial


like
 magician
 like
 that's
 this
 is
 all


Sarah.
 This
 is
 all
 her
 magic
 making


ability.
 Um
 I
 just
 putting
 that
 out


there.
 This
 is
 Sarah's
 magic
 sauce
 right


now.
 Um,
 but
 in
 terms
 of
 Grock
 and
 and


Gemini,
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 going
 to
 each


one
 will
 probably
 end
 up
 having
 like


their
 own
 niche
 niche
 niche
 niche
 if
 you


will.
 Um,
 even
 today
 as
 things
 are


progressing,
 like
 you
 know,
 I
 don't
 know


how
 many
 LLMs
 you
 guys
 have,
 but
 I
 have


a
 couple.
 I
 know
 that
 there
 are
 certain


things
 I
 need
 to
 go
 to
 Grock
 for,
 and


there
 are
 certain
 things
 that
 I
 need
 to


go
 to
 Jet
 GPT
 for.
 Grock
 is
 not
 good
 at


creating
 images,
 things
 like
 that.
 But


if
 I
 have
 a
 financial
 question
 or
 I
 need


to
 get
 social
 sentiment,
 I
 need
 to
 go
 to


Grock
 and
 there's
 not
 like
 that's
 that's


the
 place.
 Um
 stock
 stuff,
 it's
 all
 it's


all
 it's
 all
 Grock.
 It
 is
 it
 it's
 not


even
 comparable
 trying
 to
 do
 something


like
 that
 on
 chat
 GBT.
 Uh
 so
 those
 are


just
 some
 unique
 pieces
 that
 as
 things


move
 on
 it'll
 become
 more
 glaringly


obvious
 maybe
 which
 you
 use
 use
 case


which
 which
 LLM
 has
 a
 better
 piece
 and


depending
 on
 what
 you
 do
 and
 what
 your


your
 use
 cases
 you
 might
 have
 a


different
 tailored
 approach
 or
 one
 might


be
 better
 suited
 for
 you.
 So,
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 know
 that
 it's
 a
 a
 zero
 sum
 game,


per
 se.
 Um,


but
 there
 definitely
 would
 be
 a
 handful


that
 don't
 survive.
 I
 I'm
 not
 sure.
 I


don't
 like
 I
 don't
 use
 anthropic
 at
 all.


Um,
 personally,
 so
 like
 there
 might
 be


some
 that
 that
 don't
 actually
 make
 it
 or


what
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 Microsoft
 is


right
 now.
 But
 I
 think


>> yeah,
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 um
 I
 wouldn't


say
 a
 chance
 to
 your
 question,
 but
 I


don't
 know
 that
 it's
 a
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 a
 winner
 or
 take
 all
 scenario


either.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 a


commodity
 now.
 It's
 one
 that
 has
 a
 long


way
 to
 scale,
 but
 we
 we
 see
 we've
 seen


how
 this
 plays
 out
 across
 other


commodities
 like
 one
 of
 those
 uh
 which


payment
 service
 providers
 illustrate.


There's
 three
 massive
 ones
 uh
 Brainree,


Aden,
 and
 Stripe.
 And
 then
 there's
 a


bunch
 of
 smaller
 very
 specialized
 ones.


And
 usually
 the
 commodities
 will


consolidate
 into
 like
 two
 or
 three
 big


massive
 plays
 and
 then
 also
 a
 degree
 of


specialization
 as
 well.
 So
 Jason,
 you


mentioned
 you
 don't
 use
 clot.
 I
 don't


either,
 but
 that's
 because
 I'm
 not
 a


programmer.
 If
 you're
 a
 programmer,
 uh


you're
 using
 clot
 like
 they
 product
 is


very


>> well
 integrated.
 Uh
 the
 model
 protocol,


it's
 great
 and
 everything.
 And
 there's
 a


bunch
 of
 models
 like
 that
 that
 are
 like


either
 uh
 specialized
 in
 a
 a
 broad


category
 or
 they're
 very
 much
 focused


like
 on
 a
 niche
 like
 Harmonic,
 the
 Blad


Tenants,
 Robin
 Hood
 startup.
 Uh
 well,


not
 Robin
 Hood,
 but
 Blad
 Tennant


startup,
 CEO
 of
 Robin
 Hood.
 Um
 so
 I
 I


think
 that's
 the
 way
 the
 d
 this


direction
 goes
 at
 opening
 clearly
 is
 a


leader
 in
 a
 winner
 there.
 Gemini
 I


actually
 think
 is
 better
 which
 it
 just


it's
 gotten
 demonstrabably
 better
 for
 me


anyway
 since
 midepptember
 and
 I
 also
 use


Grock
 but
 I
 think
 yeah
 I
 think
 probably


a
 triopoly
 between
 those
 three
 and
 then


the
 the
 specialized
 ones
 below
 that


I
 uh
 I
 think
 Gemini
 is
 going
 to
 be


one
 of
 like
 maybe
 not
 as
 big
 as
 open
 AI


and
 but
 I
 think
 honestly
 we'll
 see
 I


think
 that's
 the
 real
 competition.


Gemini
 has
 everything.


>> I
 agree.


>> What
 do
 you
 use
 Gemini
 for?


>> Sorry,


>> just
 anything.
 Um
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 more


the
 the
 the
 components
 that
 that
 is


going
 to
 make
 Gemini
 more
 useful.
 For


example,
 OpenAI
 doesn't
 have
 hardware.


Gemini
 does.
 They
 have
 the
 phones,
 the


computers,
 Chrome,
 all
 these
 things.


Then
 if
 you
 look
 to
 um
 how
 do
 they
 lower


their
 cost
 to
 serve
 and
 and
 actually


create
 the
 tokens
 that
 you
 know
 generate


those
 responses
 they
 have
 Google
 cloud


you
 know
 Gro
 is
 requiring
 other
 services


openai
 is
 requiring
 other
 services
 and


maybe
 OpenAI
 is
 trying
 to
 strike
 a
 deal


with
 Broadcom
 to
 get
 them
 to
 create
 a


new
 chip
 you
 know
 uh
 what
 generation
 is


the
 TPU
 on
 now
 I
 mean
 they
 are
 uh
 way


ahead
 with
 Ironwood
 So,
 um,
 they
 have
 a


very
 competitive
 chip.
 In
 fact,
 I
 think


it's
 one
 of
 the
 only,
 uh,
 custom
 silicon


products
 that
 Jensen
 has
 actually
 given


any
 credit
 to.
 Like
 he
 said,
 you
 know,


TPU
 is
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 do
 well.


Like,
 like,
 um,


>> right.


>> So,
 they
 have
 such
 an
 unbelievable
 cost


to
 serve.
 They
 have
 an
 enterprise
 moat


amongst,
 you
 know,
 the
 absolute
 great


like
 who
 who who
 has
 more
 enterprise


customers
 than
 Google?
 Microsoft.
 Like,


that's
 it.


Um
 and
 so
 their
 distribution,
 their
 cost


to
 serve
 their
 data
 across
 like
 like


Google
 has
 more
 data
 than
 any
 other


company
 in
 the
 world.
 So
 um
 even
 Elon


Musk
 has
 said
 you
 know
 flat
 out
 in
 in
 a


flat
 arms
 race
 like
 Google
 takes
 this


every
 day.
 So
 um


I
 not
 personally
 do
 I
 use
 it
 that
 often.


I
 dabble,
 but
 um
 you
 know
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 people
 that
 use
 Google.


>> Let
 me
 use
 or
 say
 one
 more
 piece
 there.


Um
 Danielle
 Dallas
 at
 1021
 said,
 "Gee,
 I


will
 be
 the
 one
 your
 grandpa


accidentally
 uses."
 Distribution
 like


it's
 it's
 such
 an
 advantage.
 You
 can't


overstate
 that
 that
 there
 are
 some
 that


will
 not
 download
 OpenAI
 and
 go
 into


that,
 but
 they'll
 just
 happen
 to


accidentally
 use
 Gym
 Knight.
 It's
 an


easy
 layup
 there.
 And


>> do
 more
 work
 than
 OpenAI
 is.


>> Oh
 yes.
 And
 then
 last
 um
 it's
 it's
 kind


of
 like
 with
 payment
 service
 providers


when
 your
 business
 becomes
 a
 massive


scale
 you
 don't
 want
 just
 one
 primary


service
 payment
 service
 provider
 you


want
 multiple
 for
 redundancy
 in
 an


orchestration
 model
 and
 so
 most
 large


enterprises
 use
 two
 sometimes
 more
 of


these
 and
 it's
 the
 same
 way
 with
 KM


solution
 that
 Palanteer
 has
 and
 what


they're
 doing
 with
 what
 perplexity
 is
 it


depends
 on
 what
 the
 model
 is
 good
 at


that's
 what
 it
 actually
 uses
 uh
 when
 it


pulls
 those
 up
 and
 we're
 going to
 see


that
 across
 you
 know
 at least
 two
 or


three
 big
 ones
 and
 a
 bunch
 of


specialized
 ones.


>> Folks,
 we
 have
 a
 guest.


We
 have
 a
 guest.
 For
 the
 first
 time
 ever


in
 history,
 the
 two
 Steves
 are
 live


together.


>> First
 time
 ever.


>> First
 time
 ever.


>> I
 need
 to
 change
 my
 I
 can't
 change
 my


name.
 Live.
 Dang.


>> Asian.
 Asian
 with
 the
 milk.
 I
 don't
 have


a
 milk.


>> Of
 course,
 why
 not?


>> Not
 white
 Steve
 and
 White
 Steve
 both
 in


the
 same
 room.


We
 made
 it.


>> We
 did.


>> Amit
 just
 basking.
 I
 mean,
 he's
 just


basking
 in
 the
 What
 a
 time
 to
 be
 alive.


Steve,
 have
 you
 ever
 seen
 like
 technical


No,
 you've
 seen
 technical
 Tuesday.
 You


>> Yes,
 I
 have.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 you
 know
 Jason.
 He's
 a


>> He's
 a
 TA
 expert.
 And
 uh
 it's
 really


cool
 to
 have
 both
 of
 you
 on
 together.
 We


got
 like
 15
 minutes
 left,
 but
 Steve,


your
 response
 to
 this
 argument
 about


OpenAI,
 are
 they
 allowed
 to
 fail?


>> Well,
 I
 just
 put
 a
 probably
 a
 800word


post
 out
 about
 it.
 No,
 they're
 not.
 I


mean,
 they
 just
 did
 three
 major
 deal.


Think
 about
 what
 they
 just
 did
 in
 three


weeks.
 Well,
 two
 weeks
 at
 this
 point.
 10


gigawatt
 deal
 with
 Nvidia,
 six
 gigawatt


deal
 with
 AMD,
 and
 10
 gigawatt
 deal
 with


Broadcom.
 I
 mean
 this
 deal
 created
 a


trifactor
 and
 it
 basically
 allows
 them


or
 open
 AAI
 when
 I
 say
 them
 to
 design


the
 chips
 and
 systems
 and
 allow
 Broadcom


to
 develop
 and
 deploy
 them
 and


everything
 that
 OpenAI
 is
 learning
 from


developing
 the
 models
 they
 can
 embed


directly
 into
 the
 hardware.
 It's
 exactly


what
 Apple
 did
 with
 the
 A
 series
 chips


for
 the
 iPhones.
 And
 they
 just


did
 a
 strategic
 move
 because
 not
 only


did
 they
 take
 a
 ton
 of
 chips
 off
 the


market
 with
 Nvidia,
 which
 is
 the
 biggest


player
 in
 the
 game.
 They
 diversified
 the


stream
 with
 AMD
 and
 took
 those
 chips
 off


the
 market.
 And
 now
 they
 are
 creating


and
 designing
 their
 own
 and
 having


Broadcom
 create
 their
 own
 chips.
 So,
 no,


at
 this
 point
 it
 doesn't
 look
 like


they're
 going
 to
 fail.


>> What
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 taking
 them
 off
 the


market
 exactly?


>> Well,
 previously


Open
 AAI
 was
 going
 third
 party
 for
 their


compute.
 Now,
 they're
 going
 to
 be


building
 and
 operating
 their
 own
 data


centers.
 So,
 all
 those
 chips
 that
 would


have
 went
 to
 other
 players
 are
 going
 to


Open
 AI.


You
 don't
 think
 that
 the
 uh
 cloud
 names


are
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 accelerate
 even


if
 they're
 not
 servicing
 open?
 And
 by


the
 way,
 I
 think
 they'll
 do
 both.
 But


>> I
 think
 that
 Oh,
 they
 are
 going
 to
 do


both.
 They're
 going
 to
 keep
 contract


they
 already
 said
 they're
 going to


contract
 to
 third
 parties
 and
 they're


now
 going
 the
 big
 difference
 is
 now
 it's


the
 first
 time
 they'll
 be
 buying


directly
 from
 Nvidia
 and
 operating
 their


own
 data
 centers.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 cause


Q3
 earnings
 calls
 to
 potentially
 be
 the


most
 important
 earnings
 calls
 we've


heard
 in
 years.


>> Agreed.


>> Because
 Jasse,


Synindar,


Nadella,
 and
 Zuckerberg
 have
 to
 come


over
 the
 top.
 They
 don't
 have


>> If
 they
 don't,
 what
 happens?
 I
 mean,
 if


they
 don't
 come
 over
 the
 top,
 you
 will


see
 the
 bears
 have
 a
 field
 day
 about


OpenAI
 spending
 like
 a
 drunken
 sailor


and
 everybody
 else
 caught
 religion
 and


realize
 they
 don't
 need
 this
 much


compute.
 That's
 why
 this
 is
 the
 most


important
 series
 of
 earnings
 calls,


which
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 go
 the


opposite
 direction
 because
 Zuck
 already


said
 he
 want
 he's
 okay
 losing
 several


hundred
 billion
 dollars
 instead
 of
 not


spending
 enough.
 And
 we
 already
 heard


Nadella
 from
 Microsoft
 say
 that
 they're


going
 to
 spend
 over
 100
 billion
 this


year.
 And
 if
 my
 memory
 serves
 me


correctly,
 I
 think
 they
 spent
 68
 billion


on
 capex
 in
 their
 fiscal
 year
 25.
 So


they're
 going
 to
 increase
 that
 roughly,


I
 don't know,
 45%.
 42%.


So


this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 really
 interesting.


And
 I
 think
 that
 sky
 is
 the
 limit
 at
 the


moment.
 I'm
 not
 even
 concerned
 about


2026.


I'm
 interested
 in
 2027
 earnings
 at
 this


point
 because
 I
 think
 2026
 is
 now
 a


full-scale
 buildout.


>> Yeah.


>> Long
 Nvidia,
 baby.


>> Long
 Nvidia.


>> Yes.


>> I'm
 thinking
 about
 diversifying
 a
 little


bit.
 Well,
 not
 selling
 Nvidia,
 but
 just


going
 heavier
 and
 buying
 TSM.
 What
 do


you
 think,
 Steve?


>> Love
 it.
 Absolutely
 love
 it.


>> I'm
 planning
 to
 do
 a
 deep
 dive
 on
 TSM.


I've
 been
 looking
 at
 them
 a
 lot
 more
 as


well.
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 position,
 but
 dude,


it's
 hard
 to
 imagine
 they
 don't
 win.
 And


it's
 hard
 to
 imagine
 Broadcom
 doesn't


win.
 Hard
 to
 imagine
 Micron
 doesn't


play.
 Like
 it's
 like
 one
 of the
 reasons


I
 got
 into
 SMCI
 as
 well
 is
 because
 Jason


was
 just
 making
 a
 simple
 argument
 which


is
 like
 there's
 going
 to
 need
 to
 be
 more


liquid
 cooling
 technologies.


>> Yeah.
 More
 RA
 more
 liquid
 cooling
 more.


>> I
 just
 look
 at
 but
 see
 so
 Steve
 you
 gota


you
 got
 to
 get
 with
 me
 on
 this
 one.
 If


we
 look
 at
 the
 charts
 we
 look
 at
 where


all
 these
 stocks
 are
 today.
 Help
 me


understand
 why
 SMCI
 is
 not
 the
 stupidest


value
 here
 now
 today
 at
 near
 liberation


day
 levels.
 How
 is
 that
 not
 the
 easiest


AI
 layup
 in
 the
 market?
 Or
 is
 it?


>> No.
 Look,
 it's
 a
 huge
 layup.
 It's
 barely


done
 anything
 over
 the
 past


>> barely
 moved.
 And
 I
 mean
 just
 I'm


looking
 at
 it
 right
 now


>> 15%
 over
 the
 past
 year.


>> I
 mean


There's
 a
 non
 some
 some
 of
 my
 crew
 is


here
 for
 sure,
 but
 there's
 no
 way
 that


SMCI
 does
 not
 report
 their
 absolute
 best


earnings
 report
 this
 next
 month.
 There's


zero
 chance.
 Like,
 sorry.
 So,
 on
 record,


no
 freaking
 possibility
 that
 it's
 not


their
 absolute
 best
 earnings
 report.


Period.
 End
 of
 story.


>> Well,
 how
 about
 this?


>> I
 like
 that
 you
 put
 that
 on
 record.


>> Yeah,


>> forward
 estimates
 on
 revenue
 may
 be


light.


Oh,
 for
 sure.
 And
 the
 stock
 is
 the
 stock


is
 held
 back
 by
 its
 own
 doing
 guar
 like


given,
 right?
 Granted,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


scar
 tissue,
 but
 the
 second
 either
 they


pre-announced
 because
 they
 can't
 keep


their
 mouth
 shut
 for
 too
 long
 because


they're
 going
 to
 be
 in
 trouble
 again.


Look
 at
 look
 at
 Dell
 just
 doubled
 their


forecast.
 Doubled
 their
 forecast.
 Sorry,


I'm
 a
 little
 hyped
 up


>> on
 the
 top
 and
 bottom
 line.


>> Yeah,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 this
 is
 egregious.


This
 price
 of
 S.
 I'm
 sorry.
 It's
 just


dumb.
 Like
 it's
 like
 it's
 not
 it
 doesn't


make
 sense
 when
 I
 look
 at
 it.
 And
 I
 get


that.
 Okay.


I
 get
 why
 it's
 down
 there
 because
 it's


burnt
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 It's
 done
 a
 lot


of
 damage
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 psyches
 out


there.
 And


>> but
 that
 is
 also
 where
 the
 opportunity


is,
 right?


>> That's
 exactly
 right.
 But
 um
 you
 know,


I'm
 not
 saying
 that
 you
 have
 to
 go
 back


on
 the
 whole
 SMCI
 gravy
 train
 or
 drink


the
 Kool-Aid,
 but
 um
 but
 sure,
 I'm


serving
 the
 Kool-Aid
 today.
 But
 I
 I


think
 that
 it
 makes
 sense
 like
 the


numbers
 are
 going
 to
 come
 out
 and


there's
 even
 if
 you
 don't
 believe
 their


numbers


and
 and
 the
 margins
 are
 going
 to
 be
 crap


because
 the
 margins
 are
 crap
 and
 no,


there's
 no
 moat
 for
 the
 company
 because


it's
 it's
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 commodity,
 but


so
 is
 Micron.
 So
 is
 Micron.
 Look
 at


Micron.
 It's
 a
 a
 straightup
 commodity.


But


>> yeah,
 commodity
 isn't
 a
 bad
 word
 either.


So


>> yeah,
 but
 if
 we
 look
 across
 the
 board,


okay,
 Dell,
 SMCI
 has
 just
 as
 much
 to


gain
 as
 Dell,
 and
 I'm
 looking
 at
 the


stock
 price
 and
 I'm
 like,
 what
 is
 wrong


right
 now?
 Like
 like
 I
 know
 what's


wrong,
 but
 like
 this
 is
 Anyways,
 sorry,


let
 me
 get
 off
 my
 soap
 box.
 I'll


>> for
 for
 me,
 I
 think
 TSM,
 like
 if
 you're


going
 to
 bet
 between
 the
 two,
 uh
 TSM


makes
 more
 sense.
 I'm
 not
 an
 either,
 but


I'm
 I've
 been
 thinking
 of
 TSM
 ever
 since


we
 did
 our
 paper
 stock
 draft.
 Uh
 because


I'm
 like,
 hey,
 this
 is
 I
 I
 know
 it's


international.
 There
 is
 some
 China
 risk.


I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 less
 as
 long
 as,


you
 know,
 things
 get
 worked
 out
 between


the
 US
 and
 China.
 If
 they
 get
 cut
 off


for
 whatever
 reason
 and
 it
 starts


impacting
 them
 both
 on
 the
 the
 processor


side
 and
 also
 energy
 side,
 then
 we
 might


have,
 you
 know,
 the
 potential
 for
 a


Pearl
 Harbor
 situation
 as
 it
 relates
 to


to
 Taiwan,
 which
 is
 bad
 for
 everybody,


including
 TSM,
 especially
 TSM.
 But
 P
 is


basically
 the
 same
 between
 uh
 SMCI
 and


TSM.
 And
 you
 don't
 have
 the
 leadership


questions.
 You
 don't
 have
 the
 accounting


issues.
 Um
 there's
 a
 risk
 on
 either
 and


uh
 I
 would
 much
 rather
 do
 TSM.
 It's
 hard


to
 see
 them
 not
 do
 well.
 Same
 with
 FCI.


It
 should
 be,
 but
 the
 the
 weird


accounting
 stuff,
 not
 for
 the
 first


time.
 Um
 some
 leadership
 questions.
 Uh


it
 just
 it's
 hard.


>> Stop
 saying
 their
 name
 completely.
 Well,


that's
 not
 even


>> You
 guys
 are
 right.


>> You
 guys
 are
 right.
 Like
 that
 right


there
 is
 exactly
 why
 the
 stock
 is
 where


it
 is.


>> The
 whole
 time
 that
 it
 was
 going
 up,
 I


was
 not
 on
 the
 SMCI
 bandwagon
 to
 that


extent.
 Like,
 and
 it
 was
 just
 like
 I


don't
 I
 don't,
 you
 know,
 they're
 not


that
 great
 of
 friends,
 but
 but
 I
 can


look
 at
 this
 and
 and
 uh
 and
 maybe
 you


guys
 can
 run
 the
 numbers
 and
 land
 where


this
 figure
 out
 where
 this
 lands,
 but
 to


me,
 I
 look
 at
 it,
 I'm
 like,
 "Okay,
 this


is
 this
 is
 like
 80
 bucks,
 maybe
 more."


Um
 but
 maybe


>> sorry
 go
 ahead
 Jason.


>> Yeah.
 Oh,
 no.
 I'm
 just
 But
 but
 where
 we


are
 even
 even
 after
 today's
 5%
 or


whatever
 55
 liberation
 day
 was
 50
 it's


55
 and
 I'm
 like
 okay


you
 know


but
 anyways


>> yeah
 the
 broader
 point
 is
 it
 just
 feels


like
 if
 Nvidia
 is
 not
 going
 to
 stop
 and


AI
 is
 not
 stopping
 with
 capex
 then


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 players
 that


could
 run.
 And
 I
 think
 let's
 end
 off
 on


this
 question
 right
 here
 because
 I
 think


this
 is
 a
 this
 is
 a
 topic
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 people
 are
 thinking
 about.
 How
 are


you
 guys
 managing
 FOMO
 in
 this
 market?


So,
 you
 got
 Olo
 that's
 up
 18%
 today.


You've
 got


>> Okay,
 bro.


>> Go
 ahead.
 Go
 ahead.


>> Don't.


>> So,
 you
 have
 zero
 FOMO
 over
 quantum
 or


nuclear?


>> I'm
 not
 in
 quantum.
 What
 do
 I
 care
 about


quantum?


Like,
 the
 whole
 sector
 could
 burn.


Doesn't
 matter.
 It
 doesn't
 impact
 S&P.


None
 of
 those
 companies
 are
 in
 the
 S&P.


>> Yeah.
 Steve
 only
 feels
 FOMO
 if
 someone


told
 him
 like
 Robin
 Hood
 for
 example,


we've
 been
 telling
 him
 to
 buy
 by
 by
 then


he
 doesn't.
 That's
 when
 he
 feels
 FOMO.


>> See,
 I
 I I
 actually
 don't
 think
 he


>> But
 Steve
 doesn't
 have
 any
 like
 like


what
 what's
 the
 He
 What
 are
 you
 in
 right


now,
 Steve?


>> He
 doesn't
 like
 Robin
 Hood,
 bro.
 He


never
 got
 in.
 No,
 but
 like
 he
 but
 for


for
 this
 year
 he
 does
 not
 but
 what
 he's


saying
 is
 that
 he's
 not
 what
 I
 hear
 him


saying
 I
 don't
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 put


words
 in
 his
 mouth
 but
 I
 what
 I
 hear
 him


saying
 is
 that
 he's
 not
 putting
 his
 self


in
 the
 position
 to
 to
 be
 at
 risk
 for


that.
 And
 even
 when
 I
 look
 at
 SMCI
 I


think
 that
 that
 to
 me
 to
 answer
 your


question
 SMCI
 is
 my
 answer
 to
 your


question.
 It
 is
 not
 gone
 nuclear


like
 the
 nuclear
 stocks.


>> This
 guy's
 buying
 BMR.
 He
 won't
 buy


Robin
 Hood
 back
 when
 it
 was
 you
 know
 20


bucks.


right?
 It
 was
 at
 12
 something
 the
 other


day.
 So,
 like,
 you
 know,
 give
 him
 a


break.


>> Thieves,
 you
 guys
 are
 both
 pretty.
 You


could
 talk
 at
 the
 same
 time.


>> You
 You
 may
 not
 realize
 it,
 Jason.
 But


not
 only
 did
 he
 not
 buy
 Robin
 Hood,
 I


literally
 bought
 him
 Robin
 Hood,
 which


at at
 13
 bucks
 a
 share.
 It's
 just
 100


bucks
 worth.
 You
 know,
 it's
 one
 of
 our


end
 of
 the
 year
 gift
 type
 of
 things.
 And


he
 sold
 it.
 He
 He
 could
 have
 just


>> Wait,
 what
 did
 you
 sell
 it
 at?


I
 don't
 know.


>> Goodness.


>> Low.


>> But
 no,
 in
 all
 seriousness,
 Steve,
 why


why
 aren't
 you
 feeling
 any
 FOMO
 for
 some


of
 these
 stocks
 that
 are
 exploding
 every


day?


>> Because
 one,
 Quantum
 doesn't
 deserve
 to


explode.
 Most
 of those
 companies
 are


filis.
 You
 can't
 convince
 me
 that


Alphabet
 is
 not
 going
 to
 figure
 out


quantum
 before
 those
 companies.
 You


can't
 convince
 me
 that
 these
 companies


are
 going to
 have
 some
 major


breakthrough
 that
 Alphabet
 that's
 taking


a
 blank
 check
 approach
 to
 anything
 they


want
 to
 do
 and
 has
 been
 working
 on


quantum
 for
 god
 knows
 how
 long.
 Don't
 no


I
 would
 love
 for
 somebody
 to
 come
 on


explain
 to
 me
 why
 these
 companies
 are


going
 to
 do
 something
 that
 Alphabet


can't
 that
 Alphabet
 absolutely
 wants
 to


do
 because
 of
 their
 own
 chips
 that
 they


want
 to
 have.
 So,
 can't
 convince
 me
 on


that.
 Nuclear,


we
 don't
 even
 know
 when
 SMR
 is
 going
 to


come
 out
 or
 if
 this
 is
 even
 feasible


technology
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 stable.


>> But,
 but
 to
 push
 back
 real
 quick,
 let's


say
 there's
 so
 much
 demand
 for
 energy


that
 we
 have
 no
 choice
 but
 for
 nuclear


to
 succeed.
 Isn't
 that
 a
 reason
 to
 kind


of


>> nuclear
 should
 succeed?
 But
 companies


like
 Southern
 Company
 and
 Next
 should
 be


catching
 a
 bid.
 Southern
 company's


operating
 seven
 nuclear
 reactors.
 Same


with
 Duke
 Energy.
 Like
 nuclear
 is


already
 a
 thing.


>> So
 why
 is
 Oaklo
 getting
 a$2
 billion


valuation


>> because
 of
 the
 small
 nuclear
 reactors


that
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 place


near
 data
 centers
 and
 everybody's
 going


ugu
 gaga
 over
 that.
 But
 it's
 a
 zero


revenue
 company
 and
 they're
 not
 going
 to


generate
 revenue
 for
 years
 if
 it's
 even


possible.
 Yet
 companies
 that
 are


actually
 doing
 nuclear
 that
 have
 a
 track


record
 aren't
 catching
 a
 bid.
 There's


something
 wrong
 there.


>> So
 no
 I
 I
 really
 don't
 care.
 Like
 I
 am


in
 companies
 that
 are
 making
 me
 money


and
 I
 sleep
 very
 well
 at
 night
 and
 I


don't
 have
 to
 watch
 them
 all
 the
 time.


>> Tanner,
 your
 thoughts
 on
 handling
 FOMO


if
 you
 have
 any?


>> Um
 I
 mean


>> I
 I
 I
 don't
 have
 FOMO.
 Um


I
 I
 only
 have
 FOMO
 if
 it's
 a
 name
 that


I've
 researched
 and
 I
 was
 thinking
 about


going
 into
 and
 then
 it
 pops
 before
 I
 buy


or
 I
 don't
 buy
 enough.
 Um
 then
 I'm
 like,


"Oh,
 you
 know what?
 I
 should
 have


trusted
 myself."
 But
 if
 it's
 a
 name
 that


I'm
 not
 researching
 that
 just
 goes
 up


80%,
 I
 don't
 care
 at
 all.
 That
 might
 as


like
 I
 might
 as
 well
 have
 gone
 to
 a


casino
 and
 put
 my
 money
 on
 black
 or


something.
 Um,
 so
 I
 don't
 care.


That
 being
 said,
 um,
 in
 this,
 you
 know,


people
 are
 talking
 about
 bubbles
 and


everything.
 I
 do
 think
 that
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 companies
 that
 are
 more
 ideas


than
 actual
 businesses.
 And
 people
 are


so
 excited
 about
 the
 future
 that
 they're


pulling
 so
 much
 forward
 and
 they're


ignoring
 the
 companies
 like
 Nvidia.
 And


I'm
 saying
 that
 with
 it
 being
 a,
 you


know,
 4.6
 4.7
 trillion
 business,
 they're


ignoring
 it.
 But
 those
 are
 the
 companies


literally
 making
 money
 today
 off
 of


still
 in
 a
 very
 excitable
 future.
 And
 if


there
 is
 any
 cracks
 in
 the
 market,
 there


is
 any
 doubts
 or
 worries,
 the
 companies


that
 are
 ideas
 are
 going
 to
 go
 to


nothing.
 And
 the
 companies
 that
 are


making
 real
 money
 will
 have
 small


corrections.
 Okay.
 So
 I
 think
 the


riskreward
 is
 still
 heavily
 favored
 for


me
 playing


the
 real
 companies


but
 my
 or
 or
 sorry
 the
 reward
 is
 there


but
 my
 risk
 is
 so
 heavily


compressed
 and
 and
 and
 I
 you
 know
 just


feel
 very
 safe
 in
 these
 massive
 names


that
 are
 still
 the
 largest
 beneficiaries


of
 artificial
 intelligence,
 robotics,


cloud
 computing
 like
 I
 mean
 they've
 just


>> What
 about
 the
 What
 about
 the
 data


center
 names?
 into
 the
 entire
 AI


ecosystem.
 Iran,
 Cipher,
 Wolf,
 all
 of


those
 exploding
 every
 day.
 Do
 you
 feel


FOMO
 around
 those
 or
 you'd
 rather
 feel


fine
 in
 Nvidia
 instead?


>> Yeah,
 I
 feel
 fine
 in
 Nvidia,
 Amazon,


Google,
 all
 massive
 cloud
 names
 that


have,
 you
 know,
 lots
 of
 compute
 and
 the


need
 for
 the
 compute
 themselves,
 right?


So,
 um,


yeah,
 I
 don't
 care.
 I
 I
 benefit
 from


Nvidia
 and
 that's
 also
 why
 I
 want
 TSM.
 I


I
 I I
 care
 less
 about
 picking
 the


winners
 and
 more
 just
 the
 the
 customers


that
 are
 going
 to
 win
 across
 the
 board.


>> Roy,
 same
 question.
 How
 are
 you


navigating
 FOMO?


>> Yeah,
 so
 um
 kind
 of
 combination
 of
 what


these
 guys
 said.
 Uh
 one
 is
 I
 invest
 in


what
 I
 know.
 Uh
 quantum
 is
 an
 area
 I


don't
 know.
 And
 I
 think
 there's
 very
 few


people
 that
 know
 that.
 Uh
 you
 know,
 as


far
 as
 uh
 on
 a
 deep
 level
 what
 quantum


actually
 does,
 problem
 actually
 solves


the
 probability
 it
 actually
 works
 and


what
 disruption
 looks
 like
 in
 that


environment.
 How
 do
 we
 know
 this?
 Well,


just
 look,
 you
 know,
 a
 quarter
 or
 two


ago
 when
 massive
 hyperscalers
 such
 as


Mark
 Zuckerberg
 were
 being
 asked
 about


this.
 Also,
 what
 Jensen
 Wong
 has
 said
 as


well.
 Um,
 Zuck
 said
 something
 like,
 uh,


he
 doesn't
 really
 understand
 it.
 Uh,
 it


just
 he's
 he's
 a
 genius.
 He
 is.
 I
 don't


particularly
 like
 him,
 but
 I
 call
 it
 as


I
 see
 it.
 And
 if
 he's
 saying
 like,
 hey,


I
 know
 very
 little
 about
 this
 space.
 Um,


that
 should
 give
 everybody
 just
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 pause.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


so-called
 experts
 out
 there.
 There
 are


some
 experts,
 but
 I
 like
 I
 I
 tend


towards
 probably
 agreeing
 with
 Martin


Shakrelli
 that
 there's
 more
 more
 smoke


than
 actual
 fire
 here
 by
 a
 lot.
 Um
 it


might
 not
 be
 real
 as
 far
 as
 the
 actual


use
 case.
 We'll
 have
 to
 see,
 you
 know,


as
 it
 develops
 out,
 but
 I
 would
 rather


to
 uh
 just
 concentrate
 uh
 my
 portfolio


heavily
 in
 areas
 that
 I
 actually
 know


and
 understand.
 I
 wouldn't
 be


comfortable
 holding
 other
 than
 just
 a


swing
 trade,
 something
 that's
 in
 that


space.
 Now,
 if
 it
 is
 a
 space
 that
 I'm


interested
 in,
 what
 I've
 done
 is
 I've


adopted
 since
 we're
 in
 a
 bull
 market,


uh,
 drunken
 miller
 strategy
 of
 invest


and
 investigate.
 So,
 I'll
 do,
 you
 know,


a
 little
 bit
 of
 research,
 but
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 wait
 and
 like
 make
 sure
 that
 I


do
 100
 plus
 hours
 of
 research
 in
 this


one
 play
 before
 I
 actually
 buy.
 I'll
 do


my
 initial
 buy
 and
 as
 conviction
 rises


uh,
 while
 I
 investigate,
 then
 I'll
 add.


or
 if
 it's
 the
 opposite
 and
 I've
 done


this
 actually
 several
 times
 this
 year


where
 I'm
 start
 starting
 to
 build
 out
 a


position
 and
 I'm
 like
 no
 I
 I
 don't
 want


to
 be
 in
 this
 or
 I
 don't
 actually
 see


the
 thesis
 and
 then
 I'll
 actually
 get


out
 and
 thankfully
 in
 a
 bull
 market


usually
 you
 make
 money
 still
 but
 uh
 yeah


so
 I
 avoid
 FOMO
 just
 by
 concentrating
 do


investing
 on
 what
 I
 know
 sticking
 to
 my


strategy
 instead
 of
 chasing
 and
 I
 do


have
 a
 small
 swing
 position
 that
 allows


me
 to
 chase
 some
 of
 these
 plays
 if
 I
 see


that
 there's
 an
 opportunity
 uh
 over
 the


very
 short
 term


>> can
 I
 ask
 you
 guys
 a


Out
 of
 all
 the
 Bitcoin
 miner
 turned
 data


center
 plays,
 do
 you
 think
 they're
 all


going
 to
 survive?


>> Jason,


>> dude,


>> I
 I
 I


don't
 know
 how
 real
 that
 is.
 Um
 to
 be


fair,
 like
 I
 know
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


demand
 in
 the
 data
 center
 stuff,
 but


I
 mean
 if
 if
 it
 really
 really
 is
 just


literally
 leasing
 out
 the
 power


infrastructure
 and
 we're
 talking
 about


all
 these
 companies
 depreciating
 the
 AS6


because
 those
 are
 not


useful
 here.
 those
 are
 going
 into
 the


garbage
 like


and
 and
 they're
 not
 they're
 not
 I
 mean


so
 that's
 depreciating
 that
 off
 the


books


and
 then
 they're
 going
 to
 maybe
 lease


this
 space
 to
 somebody
 who
 wants
 it.
 I
 I


think
 it's
 very
 dependent
 on
 one
 if


someone
 likes
 them
 enough
 to
 to
 trust


them
 to
 sign
 a
 contract
 with
 them
 to
 to


basically
 co
 like
 what
 do
 you
 call
 that


to
 when
 you
 rent
 out
 some
 place
 that


you're
 already
 renting
 like
 a
 sublet


sublet
 their
 their
 data
 center
 like
 okay


just
 because
 you
 have
 power
 and
 because


you
 have
 the
 power
 infrastructure
 that's


there


>> and
 I
 don't
 know
 enough
 on
 that
 piece
 to


say
 that
 they
 do
 Ian
 I
 think
 was
 the


first
 and
 I
 totally
 missed
 boat
 on
 this


because
 I
 didn't
 really
 understand
 it


because
 when
 I
 thought
 about
 it,
 my


initial
 thought
 was
 like,
 how
 does
 that


make
 sense?
 It
 doesn't
 make
 sense


because
 my
 initial
 thought
 was
 like
 this


is
 an
 ASIC.
 An
 ASIC
 is
 not
 useful
 for


AI.
 Like
 any
 way
 that
 I
 slice
 this
 does


not
 compute.
 So,
 it
 didn't
 I
 thought
 it


was
 just
 like
 I
 don't
 know.
 It
 just
 it


didn't
 make
 sense
 to
 me.
 But
 what
 if


there
 is
 so
 much
 demand
 that
 all
 these


players
 are
 going
 to
 win
 because
 there's


literally
 just
 not
 enough


uh
 comput
 facilities


>> and
 like
 whatever
 they
 have
 is
 going
 to


be
 useful.


>> I
 mean
 I
 guess
 that's
 the
 question
 is


like
 is
 it
 is
 that
 really
 what
 we're
 is


that
 really
 that
 that
 in
 itself
 is
 the


question.
 Is
 it
 really
 the
 fact
 that
 the


physical
 real
 estate
 footprint
 for
 the


power
 and
 the
 and
 the
 power
 footprint


like
 is
 just
 so


such
 a
 scarce
 commodity


>> that
 all
 I
 mean
 that's
 how
 their
 stocks


are
 trading
 that
 all


>> that's
 how
 their
 stocks
 are
 trading
 but


I
 I
 guess
 that's
 the
 question
 I
 don't
 I


I
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 enough
 to
 give
 a


straight
 answer
 on
 that
 like
 but
 but


it's
 a
 lifeline
 that's
 for
 sure
 it's


definitely
 a
 lifeline
 because
 they


weren't
 doing
 it
 well
 doing
 whatever
 it


was
 that
 they
 were
 doing
 so
 that
 was
 not


working
 out
 so


>> mining
 was
 not
 working


>> no
 So,


>> and
 then
 they're
 still
 gonna
 they're


still
 going
 to
 dilute.
 They're
 still
 the


same
 people
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 So,
 I


don't
 know.


>> Private
 jets.


>> That's
 just
 my
 two
 cents.
 I
 don't
 know


what
 I
 I
 don't
 know.


I'm
 not
 really
 looking
 the
 chat.
 Maybe
 I


should
 because
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 you


guys
 are
 on
 this,
 but
 that's
 that's
 my


that's
 my


>> No,
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 made
 a


lot
 of
 money
 off
 those
 names.
 And
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 trying
 to


figure
 out


>> do
 I
 hold
 or
 do
 I
 jump
 in?
 And
 I
 mean,


holding
 is
 one
 thing,
 but
 jumping
 in
 it


it's
 a
 little
 tough
 at
 these
 levels


unless
 you
 think
 it
 there's
 just
 an


explosive
 room
 for
 upside
 because
 demand


is
 that
 high.
 And
 even
 the
 Galaxy
 CEO,


he
 was
 on
 my
 my
 show
 last
 week
 and
 he


was
 just
 like,
 it
 might
 be
 a
 bubble.
 He


was
 literally
 telling
 everyone,
 hey,


like,
 yeah,
 we're
 getting
 a
 lot
 of


money,
 but
 it
 might
 not
 be,
 you
 know,


it's
 like
 you
 really
 have
 to
 see
 the


management
 execution
 over
 the
 next
 five


years
 on
 this
 stuff.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 mad
 respect
 right
 there


when
 you
 can
 call
 your
 own
 business
 and


say,
 well,
 we
 might
 be
 benefiting
 from
 a


bubble
 right
 now.


Yeah,
 agreed.


>> I
 think
 Regetti
 just
 said
 something


along
 the
 lines,
 "No,


>> dude.
 Regetti
 exploded
 today.
 This
 is


like


25%
 up
 on
 I
 mean,


>> and
 you
 say
 expectations
 were
 getting
 a


little
 too
 excitable
 or
 something?"


>> Yeah.


I
 mean,
 it's
 up
 6,000%
 in
 a
 year,
 dude.


This
 is
 like
 VCs
 chase
 thousands
 of


companies
 to
 find
 the
 one
 thing
 that


will
 go
 up
 6,000%.
 Over
 10
 years.


Regetti
 is
 up
 6,000
 more
 than
 6,000%
 and


you
 could
 have
 bought
 it
 for
 under
 a


dollar
 last
 year.


>> Congrats
 to
 shareholders.


>> I'm
 so
 glad
 I'm
 not
 short
 on
 that.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 just
 You
 know what?
 We're
 all


betting
 on
 the
 quantum
 internet
 stack


and
 um
 What
 are
 you
 laughing
 at?
 And


it's
 going
 to
 be
 great.


>> All
 I
 know
 is
 I'm
 about
 to
 get
 two
 for


here
 on
 on
 the
 games
 tonight.


Steve,
 why
 why
 don't
 you
 bet
 on
 sports


as
 much
 as
 Jason?


>> Who
 are
 you
 talking
 about?


>> You
 talking
 to
 me?


>> No.
 Why
 doesn't
 white
 Steve
 as
 much
 as


Asian
 Steve?
 I
 don't
 get
 it.
 Like


>> I
 thought
 white
 Steve
 was
 in
 the
 sports


arena.


>> He
 bets
 on
 like
 the
 Yankees
 or


something,
 but
 he
 doesn't
 bet
 on


>> baseball
 is
 the
 hardest
 sport
 to
 bet
 on.


I
 might
 as
 well
 I
 do
 better
 on
 tennis,


dude.


>> I
 might
 do
 better
 with
 table
 tennis.


Dude,
 run
 lines
 are
 freaking
 awesome.


>> All
 right,
 so
 I
 think
 the
 best
 one's


Asian
 Steve.


>> Well,
 it's
 not
 the
 white
 Steve.
 I'm


Well,
 that's
 So,
 there's
 the
 white
 Steve


and
 the
 not
 white
 Steve,
 which
 is
 the


Asian
 Steve.
 So,
 I
 I'll
 claim
 it
 right


here.


>> The
 one
 that's
 called
 Jason.


>> Oh,
 last
 thing.
 We
 always
 got
 to
 talk


about
 this
 thing.
 All
 of
 us
 are


>> Oh,
 heavens.
 Yes.


Yep.
 Buy
 it
 a
 lot.
 Little
 too
 heavy
 in


this
 name,


>> but
 I'm
 a
 believer
 in
 Ethereum.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 like
 if
 you're
 bullish
 on


Ethereum,
 you're
 bullish
 on
 on
 a
 bit
 of


mine.
 Uh
 with
 one
 exception.
 So


>> I
 sort
 that.


>> That
 was
 me.


>> Did
 it.


>> Yeah,
 it
 was
 sloppy,
 quick,
 but
 I
 was


like,
 it
 had
 to
 be.


>> It's
 a
 good
 one.
 This
 is
 a
 good
 one.


>> It's
 a
 good
 show.
 It's
 It's
 a
 classic


show.
 It's
 a
 great
 show.


>> All right.
 I
 just
 BMR
 I
 have
 a
 I
 have


enough
 crypto,
 but
 it
 was
 one
 for
 me


that
 I
 looked
 at
 and
 like
 if
 I
 was
 going


to
 put
 I
 think
 BMR
 has
 a
 has
 a
 as
 a
 plus


like
 an
 extra
 check
 cuz
 for
 someone
 who


even
 who
 might
 have
 owned
 even
 a
 lot
 of


crypto
 coming
 into
 this
 already
 from


maybe
 the
 ultra
 lows
 around
 100.
 It
 it


has
 never
 made
 sense
 for
 me
 to
 even


think
 about
 adding
 until


an
 X
 Factor
 like
 a
 Tom
 Lee.
 Literally


never
 even
 thought
 about
 thinking
 about


really
 adding
 to
 be
 completely
 honest.


Um


but


that's
 the
 only
 that
 that
 that
 was
 the


only
 reason
 like
 I
 even
 considered
 it.


And
 because
 of
 that,
 I'm
 like,
 you
 know


what?
 It's
 an
 extra
 it's
 an
 extra


leverage,
 so
 it'll
 possibly
 possibly


make
 sense.


>> All
 right,
 I
 think
 that
 is
 it
 for
 us.


Uh,
 Steve,
 both
 of
 you,
 Steves,
 thank


you
 for
 joining.


>> Thank
 you,
 Steve.


>> Awesome.
 Maybe.


>> Yes.
 Uh,
 we'll
 do
 technical
 Tuesday


tomorrow
 with
 Jason.
 We
 do
 have
 bank


earnings
 tomorrow.
 So,
 I
 think
 all
 of
 us


will
 be
 watching
 out
 for
 what
 we've
 got


with
 the
 banks
 to
 start
 off.


>> Who
 is
 tomorrow?
 Is
 it
 Oh,
 ASML's


Wednesday
 morning.
 This
 is
 the
 first
 the


first
 semi
 to
 go
 ASML.
 Who's
 Who's


actually
 not
 done
 good
 lately?
 The
 last


couple
 quarters
 has
 not
 been
 They
 had
 a


huge
 rebound.
 What
 do
 you
 guys
 think


about
 ASML?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 think
 the
 stock
 is
 telling
 us


it's
 ready
 to
 do
 well,
 but
 I
 guess
 we're


going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 what
 numbers
 they


put
 up.
 Yeah,


>> but
 we
 have
 JP
 Morgan
 and
 Black
 Rockck


tomorrow.
 Those
 are
 the
 big
 ones.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 that's
 what
 we're
 gonna
 see.
 Uh


Steve's
 Twitter,
 I
 put
 that
 in
 the
 chat.


Jason's
 Twitter,
 I
 put
 that
 in
 the
 chat


as
 well.
 We'll
 be
 live
 tomorrow.
 We'll


get
 through
 Technical
 Tuesday.
 We'll
 be


back
 next
 week.


>> Tuesday.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 in
 the
 next
 week,
 we'll


have
 a
 lot
 of
 earnings.
 And
 so,
 that'll


help
 us
 kind
 of
 figure
 out
 what
 we
 have


for
 tech
 earnings.
 Steve
 just
 put
 out


this
 big
 post
 on
 the
 AI
 bubble
 not


existing.
 So,
 you
 guys
 can
 read
 that
 on


his
 Twitter
 as
 well.


and
 we'll
 keep
 covering
 it
 over
 the
 next


week.


>> This
 was
 fun.
 Appreciate
 the
 invite.


>> I
 love
 it.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 We
 will
 see
 you
 guys
 next


Monday.


>> Thanks
 guys.


>> Milk
 and
 cookies.
 Adios.


>> Milk
 and
 cookies.


>> Bye
 everybody.


>> Like
 a
 white
 Russian.
