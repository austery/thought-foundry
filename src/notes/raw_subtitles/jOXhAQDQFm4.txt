From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Monday,
 October
 27th.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


With
 the
 government
 shutdown
 nearing
 the


1
 month
 mark,
 many
 Americans
 may
 soon
 be


cut
 off
 from
 a
 crucial
 part
 of
 the


social
 safety
 net,
 food
 stamps.
 Tens
 of


millions
 of
 low-income
 Americans
 who


rely
 on
 SNAP,
 the
 federal
 food


assistance
 program,
 could
 lose
 access
 as


soon
 as
 this
 weekend.
 That's
 as
 many
 as


1
 in
 eight
 people
 in
 the
 country.
 Some


states
 have
 said
 they're
 going
 to
 try


and
 step
 up
 to
 fill
 the
 gap,
 others
 are


still
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 a
 plan.
 And


while
 the
 Department
 of
 Agriculture
 had


signaled
 that
 it
 could
 use
 emergency


funds
 to
 keep
 the
 benefits
 flowing,
 it


said
 in
 a
 memo
 on
 Friday
 that
 it
 will


not
 tap
 into
 that
 reserve.


>> Good
 morning.
 Can
 I
 get
 you
 some


potatoes?


>> Across
 the
 country,
 food
 banks
 are


bracing
 for
 a
 surge
 in
 demand.


>> Many
 were
 stretched
 thin
 even
 before
 the


shutdown.
 Food
 prices
 driven
 up
 by


inflation
 have
 meant
 more
 and
 more


Americans
 rely
 on
 food
 banks.
 One


network
 in
 Oregon
 has
 seen
 a
 50%
 jump
 in


visits
 in
 the
 past
 2
 years
 alone.
 And


earlier
 this
 year,
 the
 Trump


administration
 slashed
 nearly
 a
 billion


dollars
 in
 anti-hunger
 programs,


including
 one
 that
 provided
 food


directly
 to
 food
 banks.
 Without
 federal


support,
 food
 banks
 and
 pantries
 the


Times
 spoke
 with
 across
 the
 country
 said


they'll
 only
 be
 able
 to
 provide
 a


fraction
 of
 the
 assistance
 they
 used
 to.


The
 need
 is
 even
 greater
 in
 areas
 with


lots
 of
 federal
 workers,
 many
 of
 whom


aren't
 getting
 paychecks
 right
 now.
 In


Maryland
 on
 Saturday,
 for
 example,
 cars


lined
 up
 for
 blocks
 at
 an
 event
 for


those
 federal
 workers.
 They
 ran
 out


after
 passing
 out
 over
 300
 boxes
 of
 food


and
 had
 to
 turn
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 people


away.


Meanwhile,
 the
 Trump
 administration
 says


it's
 accepted
 a
 $130
 million
 donation
 to


help
 the
 government
 pay
 troops
 during


the
 shutdown,
 despite
 the
 fact
 that


federal
 law
 prohibits
 the
 government


from
 spending
 money
 Congress
 hasn't


appropriated.
 The
 White
 House
 wouldn't


say
 who
 the
 money
 came
 from,
 but
 the


Times
 has
 learned
 from
 two
 sources
 that


the
 donor
 is
 Timothy
 Melon,
 the
 heir
 to


a
 banking
 and
 railroad
 fortune.
 Melon,


who
 is
 famously
 reclusive,
 is
 a
 longtime


backer
 of
 President
 Trump.
 The
 president


had
 already
 signed
 an
 executive
 order


directing
 the
 Pentagon
 to
 use
 unspent


R&D
 money
 to
 pay
 military
 salaries,
 but


lawmakers
 have
 warned
 that
 moving
 funds


around
 like
 that
 is
 only
 a
 temporary


fix.
 Melon's
 donation
 to
 the
 Pentagon


works
 out
 to
 just
 about
 $100
 per
 service


member.


Yesterday,
 President
 Trump
 kicked
 off
 a


nearly
 week-long
 trip
 across
 East
 and


Southeast
 Asia.
 He
 started
 in
 Malaysia.


As
 of
 this
 morning,
 he's
 in
 Japan
 and


he'll
 head
 to
 South
 Korea
 next.
 He'll
 be


discussing
 a
 range
 of
 trade
 deals
 and


coming
 face-tof
 face
 with
 the
 leaders
 of


countries
 that
 he's
 pummeled
 with


tariffs
 over
 the
 last
 10
 months.


>> It's
 hard
 to
 overstate
 the
 degree
 to


which
 distrust
 has
 entered
 the
 global


system
 because
 of
 how
 Trump
 enacts


foreign
 policy
 and
 Asia
 perhaps
 more


than
 any
 other
 part
 of
 the
 world
 has


felt
 it
 intensely.


>> Damen
 Cave
 is
 a
 global
 affairs


correspondent
 for
 the
 Times.
 He's
 based


in
 Vietnam.
 He
 says
 that
 while
 many


countries
 in
 the
 region
 are
 somewhat


optimistic
 since
 the
 Trump


administration
 has
 been
 signing
 some


preliminary
 agreements
 recently,
 they're


also
 very
 wary.


>> One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 hear
 in
 the


region
 all
 the
 time
 is
 it's
 not
 just
 the


problem
 of
 tariffs
 and
 the
 economic


approach
 the
 United
 States.
 It's
 just


the
 uncertainty.
 You
 never
 know
 which


version
 of
 Trump
 you're
 going to
 get.


It's
 his
 impulsiveness.
 It's
 the
 lack
 of


detail
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 deals.
 And
 so


that
 uncertainty
 has
 created
 a
 real


sense
 of
 instability.
 And
 you
 know,
 for


a
 lot
 of
 countries,
 I
 think
 in
 the
 short


term,
 they're
 going to
 say
 to
 the
 United


States,
 "This
 is
 great.
 We
 love
 you.
 We


really
 want
 you
 to
 be
 here."
 But
 in
 the


medium
 to
 long
 term,
 a
 lot
 of the
 people


that
 I
 talked
 to
 in
 the
 region
 are


saying,
 "We
 need
 to
 diversify
 away
 from


the
 United
 States."
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 we


can
 ever
 trust
 the
 United
 States
 again


the
 same
 way
 that
 we
 used
 to.


The
 most
 consequential
 part
 of
 Trump's


Asia
 trip
 will
 come
 later
 this
 week
 at
 a


summit
 in
 South
 Korea
 where
 he's


scheduled
 to
 sit
 down
 for
 an
 in-person


meeting
 with
 Chinese
 President
 Xiinping.


>> Mr.
 Secretary,
 do
 you
 believe
 that
 China


is
 ready
 to
 make
 a
 trade
 deal?
 Uh


Kristen,
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 they
 are
 because


we
 just
 finished
 two
 days
 of


negotiations
 and
 we've
 created
 a


framework
 for
 the
 two
 leaders
 to
 discuss


on
 Thursday
 in
 Korea.


>> Ahead
 of
 the
 meeting,
 Treasury
 Secretary


Scott
 Bessant
 told
 NBC
 that
 American
 and


Chinese
 officials
 have
 reached
 some


preliminary
 agreements
 to
 diffuse
 the


economic
 tensions
 between
 China
 and
 the


US.
 The
 two
 sides
 have
 been
 at
 odds
 over


a
 wide
 range
 of
 issues
 from
 export


controls
 on
 rare
 earth
 minerals
 to


stopping
 fentanyl
 trafficking
 to
 Trump's


steep
 tariffs
 on
 Chinese
 goods.


In
 Russia
 yesterday,
 President
 Vladimir


Putin
 announced
 that
 his
 country
 has


successfully
 tested
 a
 nuclearpowered


missile.
 It's
 capable
 of
 carrying
 a


nuclear
 weapon.
 And
 because
 it
 runs
 on


nuclear
 power
 itself,
 the
 Kremlin
 says


it
 can
 fly
 for
 much
 longer
 than
 other


missiles
 and
 can
 evade
 defense
 systems.


The
 missile
 is
 called
 the
 Boravestnik,


named
 after
 a
 seabird
 that
 some
 believe


foreshadows
 a
 storm.
 In
 the
 test
 flight,


a
 Russian
 official
 said
 it
 stayed


airborne
 for
 15
 hours,
 traveling
 8,700


miles.
 That's
 about
 a
 third
 of
 the


circumference
 of
 the
 Earth.
 Putin
 said


no
 other
 country
 in
 the
 world
 has
 a


missile
 like
 this.
 And
 an
 expert
 in


nuclear
 non-prololiferation
 called
 the


development
 worrying,
 saying
 it
 was
 like


a
 tiny
 flying
 Chernobyl.
 The
 successful


test
 wasn't
 unexpected.
 Analysts
 say
 the


weapon's
 been
 in
 development
 in
 Russia


for
 years.
 But
 this
 is
 the
 first
 time


since
 President
 Trump
 returned
 to
 office


that
 Putin
 has
 so
 openly
 discussed


nuclear
 threats.


At
 the
 moment,
 there's
 an
 arms
 control


treaty
 between
 the
 US
 and
 Russia
 that


puts
 limits
 on
 the
 number
 of
 long
 range


nukes
 that
 can
 be
 deployed
 in
 the
 field.


It's
 set
 to
 expire
 in
 February,
 though


Putin
 has
 offered
 to
 extend
 it
 for


another
 year
 as
 long
 as
 the
 US
 does
 the


same.
 Trump
 has
 said
 that
 proposal,


quote,
 sounds
 like
 a
 good
 idea
 to
 me.


We
 are
 due
 to
 get
 a
 direct
 hit
 category


4
 and
 possibly
 category
 5.


>> In
 the
 Caribbean,
 authorities
 in
 at


least
 five
 countries,
 including
 Haiti,


the
 Dominican
 Republic,
 and
 Jamaica
 are


urging
 residents
 to
 evacuate
 from


low-lying
 areas
 ahead
 of
 Hurricane


Melissa.


>> Do
 not
 take
 this
 one
 lightly.
 This
 may


be
 the
 one.


>> At
 the
 moment,
 Jamaica
 seems
 poised
 to


take
 the
 brunt
 of
 it.
 Melissa
 could
 be


the
 strongest
 storm
 in
 recorded
 history


to
 ever
 make
 landfall
 there.
 Forecasters


are
 predicting
 that
 as
 much
 as
 3
 f
 feet


of
 rain
 could
 fall,
 which
 could
 trigger


catastrophic
 flash
 flooding
 and
 wash
 out


roads.
 People
 in
 the
 region
 are
 already


starting
 to
 feel
 the
 storm's
 effects.


It's
 expected
 to
 move
 across
 Jamaica


tomorrow,
 but
 because
 it's
 moving


relatively
 slowly,
 it
 could
 linger
 over


the
 island
 for
 as
 long
 as
 a
 day.


And
 finally,
 it
 is
 Halloween
 week.
 You


have
 until
 Friday
 to
 figure
 out
 your


costume
 or
 your
 kid's
 costume,
 which
 can


be
 stressful,
 no matter
 if
 you're
 trying


to
 hot
 glue
 and
 paperier-mâché
 and


armadillo
 outfit
 or
 if
 you're
 just


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 where
 the
 closest


Spirit
 Halloween
 is.
 According
 to


Spirit,
 the
 most
 popular
 costumes
 at
 the


Halloween
 mega
 store
 this
 year
 are,
 drum


roll
 please,


the
 K-pop
 demon
 hunter
 characters
 from


the
 hit
 Netflix
 movie.
 They're
 a
 girl


band,
 but
 they
 also
 slaughter
 monsters.


>> I
 hope
 you're
 happy.
 I
 hope
 you're


happy.
 Now,


>> wicked
 costumes
 are
 also
 flying
 off
 the


shelves.
 Remember,
 if
 you're
 deciding
 if


you're
 a
 Glenda
 or
 an
 Alphaba,
 one


requires
 washing
 off
 a
 lot
 more
 green


face
 paint,
 so
 choose
 accordingly.
 And


>> are
 you
 the
 protectors
 of
 this
 world?


>> Yes,
 we
 are.
 The
 Fantastic
 Four
 costumes


are
 also
 a
 top
 choice
 according
 to


Spirit
 because
 superheroes.
 There
 you


go.
 Of
 course,
 this
 year
 there's


definitely
 some
 DIY
 options
 out
 there.


With
 just
 a
 yellow
 safety
 vest
 and
 a


tiara,
 you
 could
 be
 one
 of
 the
 thieves


that
 hit
 the
 Lou.
 Though,
 there
 were


some
 arrests
 in
 that
 case
 over
 the


weekend,
 so
 maybe
 add
 some
 handcuffs.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 Today
 on
 the


Daily,

 inside
 look
 at
 the
 federal
