This metal is about as close to magic
as it is possible to find in nature.
I just don't get it.
It can adjust its arrangement of atoms
to return to some predefined shape,
but it also converts between
mechanical and thermal energy.
And it can stretch up to 30 times more
than an ordinary metal
and still spring back
to its original size.
I can feel it in my hands shrinking back.
Because of these unique properties,
it's being used in everything
from medical devices to toys,
to bulletproof bike tires.
And it's allowing NASA
to reinvent the wheel
for a space exploration.
- This is the bones of the tire.
- [Derek] The bones of
the tire is a slinky.
- So basically this is the
slinky applied to the rim.
- You just wrapped a slinky around a rim.
- Yeah.
It doesn't get any
simpler than that, right?
Here is a bicycle that has
slinkies inside a polymer,
if you look inside there.
- [Derek] This tire does not
require air pressure to work.
The structure and shock absorption
are all provided by that metal slinky.
- [Jim] So that's like
around a hundred psi
or what a normal road
bike would feel like.
- [Derek] Yeah.
Which means you should
be able to puncture it
with no loss of performance.
So we're gonna drive
it over a bed of nails,
but first we'll test a
traditional pneumatic tire
just to make sure these nails are sharp.
(tires popping)
(upbeat music)
- [Jim] Another puncture,
another flat tire.
- This one, kind of expected.
So now I'm going to put these
airless tires to the test
driving over the same bed of nails.
Here we go.
(tires popping)
I heard a lot of pops.
I must have hit some nails.
I don't feel anything different.
(upbeat music)
Still rides well.
I'm gonna get up some speed.
- [Jim] That's definitely a nail.
- [Derek] I think the nail broke in it,
why does it look like-
- [Jim] That's what it looks like.
- [Derek] Yeah the nail's in the tire.
- We're now gonna try to
shoot a bullet into the tire
and see what happens.
3, 2, 1.
(bullet firing)
(upbeat music)
- There it is.
- There it is.
- Whoo!
- Look at that.
(Derek chuckling)
- [Derek] Wow.
It's a really clean shot straight through.
- [Jim] Yep, you can barely
even see the mark on the tire.
Looks like this one actually hit the-
- [Derek] Alloy?
- [Jim] Yep, it does to me.
- [Derek] Yeah that's what it feels like.
- [Jim] You can see we
spliced off some of the bullet
before we even got to the cardboard.
- [Jim] How's the ride?
- Yeah no problems.
Bulletproof bicycle.
This bulletproof bike tire actually
comes out of NASA's research
into making wheels for space missions.
(upbeat music)
It is really hard to make
good wheels for other planets.
I mean a lot of the places
we wanna send rovers to,
there is no or very low
atmospheric pressure.
- We can't use rubber pneumatic tires
because of the extreme
conditions on the moon and Mars
there's no confining
pressure outside of it.
It can basically explode.
- [Derek] Besides with temperatures
dropping to extreme lows,
rubber becomes brittle.
- If this were a flagpole,
the temperature facing the sun
would be 250 degrees
Fahrenheit above zero.
In the shadow it's 250 degrees below zero.
Let's put some rubber on the moon.
- 90 is the glass transition temperature.
It's when the polymer
goes from being flexible
to a rigid element.
- [Derek] This is what
happens when you dip rubber
in liquid nitrogen.
(rubber exploding)
(bright music)
(Jim chuckling)
That's why you can't
send rubber to the moon.
This is why almost all the wheels used
for exploring other planets
have been made of hard metal.
- This is actually a spare
for the curiosity rover.
They're made out of aluminum.
A single billet that gets machined down
so you don't have to worry
about fasteners or welds
or anything like that,
that could potentially be a failure point.
- But with it being so expensive
to launch matter into space,
the wheels have to be as
lightweight as possible.
It's lightish, but it's still heavy.
- To meet those mass
limitations they made the skin
0.7 millimeters thick thin.
- Thinner than a credit card.
- Yep, these structural members here,
which we also call grousers,
they're there to give the wheel strength,
but also help grab onto
obstacles and help grab the soil.
The problem is that because
this rubber is so large
and heavy and the terrain is
just so aggressive and nasty,
they're actually seeing
much higher peak loads
kind of focused on areas
between these grousers
than what was predicted.
This is the actual condition of the wheels
on Mars right now.
And as you can see, we've
got big holes and cracks
where that skin was.
Now the wheel still operates,
hasn't immobilized the rover.
It's still gonna complete its mission,
but it does affect where it
can go and how efficient it is.
- [Derek] When you apply
a force to a material
that is known as a stress.
And what you're really doing is tugging
on all the atoms inside the object,
and as a result, their
spacing changes a little bit
and so the material deforms.
For example, if you pull on an object,
it will get slightly longer.
And the per unit change in
length is called strain.
Now for most materials under low stresses,
strain is directly proportional
to the stress applied.
And the more you stress
it the more it stretches,
and the material is elastic.
If you remove the stress,
the object goes back to its original size.
So no atoms have moved around
and no bonds have been broken or formed.
You've just made them flex
when you apply that stress.
But if the stress applied exceeds
the yield strength of the material,
well then the strain is so great
that the atoms can't
maintain their positions
relative to each other.
Defects called edge dislocations
can move through the material.
The atoms are actually
rearranging themselves,
and so the deformation is not reversible.
It's plastic deformation.
So the object won't go
back to its original shape
when the stress is removed.
If enough stress is applied,
the material can completely fracture.
In the worst case scenario,
this results in holes
like in the Mars rover wheels,
which reduce their performance
and ultimately could
jeopardize the mission.
Ordinary metals can withstand a strain
of only around 0.3 to 0.8% elastically.
Any more than that, and they
undergo plastic deformation
so they won't return to
their original shape.
Ultimately, they could even fracture.
All right.
- [Jim] Yeah and you kinked it too.
- Kinked it and stretched it.
And that's why every
component of a space vehicle
is designed never to stretch
more than that 0.3 to 0.8%.
But that's a significant limitation.
There is a different type of wheel
that NASA has tried in space,
which are those on the Apollo
Lunar Roving Vehicle or LVR.
- [Jim] That particular
structure that they built
is something that we call pantograph.
All it is is a set of wires
that have been over,
under, over, under woven.
- [Derek] And this on the surface here
to get ripped also to strengthen?
- It's primarily to ensure that
the tire does not sink into the ground.
So they did some studies
with these tread strips
to figure out how much
coverage they needed.
And so they found out that
roughly 50% was enough
to keep the tire kind of
floating on the surface
and still maintain that flexibility.
- [Derek] The Lunar Roving
Vehicle wheels worked well
for the short distance
journeys traveled on the moon.
I mean the farthest this vehicle ever went
was 36 kilometers, but still, these wheels
needed to be designed to
minimize plastic deformation
of the steel mesh.
- And so they put this internal
structure inside there.
We call it a bump stop.
So as they hit a bump,
and this is deformed,
when it hits that it stops the deformation
to keep it just below
that proportional limit
where they would induce plasticity.
- [Derek] This wheel was good enough
for the short Apollo missions,
but for longer journeys a
bump stop won't be enough
to prevent plastic deformation
building up over time.
Mesh steel wheels have
been tried on earth,
but their performance
does degrade over time.
- This was the Mars steel
spring tire we made and drove
on that same test rig.
And there's no fracture
but you see a lot of
permanent deformation there.
- [Derek] What we need is a material
that is strong and durable like steel,
but which can endure much more strain
without deforming permanently.
And that is where this stuff comes in.
In 1961, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory
was doing experiments
with different alloys
involving nickel and titanium.
A sample that had been repeatedly
worked, heated and cooled
was shown to one of the
associate technical directors
who just happened to be a pipe smoker.
So he decided to see
what the sample would do
if he applied a bit of
heat from his lighter.
And when he did that,
he found that the material changed shape.
This shocked everyone and
led to more investigations
into the material.
Which became known as nitinol,
for its components nickel and titanium,
and for the Naval Ordinance laboratory
where it was discovered.
So why did nitinol change shape?
Well it's really because
the alloy can undergo
a phase change in the solid state.
In heated nitinol the atoms are arranged
in a cubic lattice arrangement,
and this phase is known as austenite.
But upon cooling, the
atoms ease into a form
known as twinned martensite.
It's a messier lower symmetry
arrangement of the atoms.
And in this phase, you can
apply stress to the material
and deform it.
But unlike in an ordinary metal,
this deformation is not causing
bonds between atoms to break
and edge dislocations moving
throughout the material.
Now in this case,
the crystal structure
is changing once again
to a detwinned form of martensite.
And now when you heat it back up,
the material goes from martensite
back to being austenite.
Which means all the atoms go back
to their original locations,
and so the material returns
to its original shape.
- We can basically set this shape
as the parent known memory shape.
That's why we call it shape memory.
I can stretch this out.
If I cooled it down I could
stretch it out even more,
but as soon as I heat it back up,
it'll remember that original parent shape.
- [Derek] And that's why
nitinol is considered
a shape memory alloy.
The shape is set at high temperature
when the material is
in the austenite phase.
Then as the material is cooled down,
it undergoes a phase transition
into twinned martensite.
If stress is now applied to
the material in this phase,
it can be extensively deformed
by changing the crystal
structure into detwinned martensite.
When the stress is released
most of that deformation remains.
But when the sample is heated,
the atoms return to the austenite phase,
which returns the material
to its original shape.
(Derek laughing)
It's like you're barely in the water.
- No.
- And it just-
- It's as fast as you
can conduct heat to it
or get heat away from it.
- [Derek] Whoa, whoa.
I mean that's cool.
This is the property of nitinol
that most people are aware of,
and one that makes it useful
for a lot of applications.
So that's a stint.
- They slightly cool these
down right below to martensite,
and then they crush it or elongate it.
So you can see it gets real thin.
And then they put in a catheter
and that catheter goes through the body
to the place where they
wanna deploy the stent.
And then upon deploying
it, it bounces right back.
Increasing that outer diameter
and opening that artery.
Nitinol is absolutely perfect for that.
- [Derek] Shape memory
alloys can actually generate
significant forces when they're heated,
which means they can also
be used as actuators.
- You're gonna see a huge amount of force
and stress build up in the wire,
which we can see here with
how much it's pulling.
- [Derek] Six pounds, seven,
you can really see it contracting there.
13, 15, 16, 17, 20 pounds.
Oh it's lifting it.
That's about 90 newtons of force.
Scientists have even
used shape memory alloys
to fracture a rock.
Shape memory alloys are being investigated
for use in aviation.
I made a video before
about vortex generators.
Which are these little fins that stick up
outta the wing of a plane
to trip the airflow into turbulence.
This is important for takeoff and landing
to keep the flow attached to
the wings so you don't stall.
- But when you're up at cruise
and you don't need those
vortices being generated,
you want these to stow because
they're a drag penalty.
As the plane just climbs
from takeoff to cruise
we go from some temperature on the ground
to something close to
-50, -60 C at cruise.
The alloy is designed in between those
so that we can just take
advantage of the ambient
temperature change that
happens in the environment.
When we cool this one down,
no controller, no operator,
it autonomously stays flat.
- [Derek] The temperature at
which the material transitions
between austenite and
martensite can be tuned
to be anywhere between -150
to -350 degrees Celsius.
This is done by changing
the ratio of the elements
and using different heat treatments.
- [Santo] And then as
that would heat back up
coming into landing,
it goes right back up.
- [Derek] This principle has been extended
to operate the main flaps on an aircraft.
Now the heating and
cooling is not passive,
but controlled by a heating element.
- So we've done demonstrations
where you have a 737 aircraft
and no hydraulic
actuators on the wing box.
All we have is a shuttle mechanism
that's driven by two tubes in nitinol
and we've driven those
air arms and flap elements
on the wing box of a 737 in flight,
60 degrees flap angle down,
30 degrees flap angle up
just by heating and cooling
two tubes of nitinol,
replaces all the hydraulics.
- [Derek] The shape memory effect
is the main thing people know
about materials like nitinol,
but they have another unique property
which makes them ideal
for making durable wheels.
- And you're just gonna take
it and you're gonna loop it
a couple times around your hand like that,
and you're just gonna pull on that wire
and feel 6 to 8% strain
in a piece of metal.
- Oh that's really weird.
- [Santo] That's 6 to 8% strain,
which you can't do in other wires, right?
- But what's weird about it
is that it feels a little crunchy.
- [Santo] 'Cause you're feeling
all of the reorientation.
- [Derek] Oh so weird.
- [Santo] So cool though, right?
- [Derek] Yes, very cool.
(nitinol pinging)
Can you hear that?
- [Emily] Yep.
- [Derek] How weird is that?
- [Santo] That pinging is 20.
- [Derek] Shape memory
alloys can stretch up to 8%
of their length and still spring back
to their original size.
This property is known as super elasticity
or pseudo elasticity,
but they're kind of misnomers
because the material
is not actually operating
in its elastic regime.
What's actually happening
is that this nitinol
is in the austenite phase.
It's transition temperature is
lower than room temperature.
But by applying a stress, even
with no temperature change,
you can force the crystal structure
to change from austenite
into detwinned martensite.
And this rearrangement allows the nitinol
to deform by that 8% and
still it'll snap back
to its original configuration
once the stress is removed
and the atoms return
to the austenite phase.
(nitinol pinging)
That sound you're hearing is the material
undergoing a stress-induced
phase change in the solid state.
If you wanna think about it
on a stress strain curve.
Now this transformation is occurring
entirely above the martensite
transition temperature.
So the material starts off
in the austenite phase,
and then the applied stress is
what induces the phase change
from austenite to detwinned martensite.
And when that stress is removed,
the atoms spring back
to the austenite phase,
and so the material goes
back to its original size
and shape.
- If this were a normal
tube I would bend it to here
and it would plasticize.
If it was a brass tube,
which you know has a
plastic buckling mode,
it would go like this and it
would actually buckle a wall.
I would never take my hands
and bend them like this
and have it completely returned to shape.
- [Derek] At the bend the
nitinol is transforming
from austenite to martensite and back.
- When we go from the
higher symmetry phase,
the austenite to the lower
symmetry daughter phase,
which one is it?
Exothermic or endothermic?
- I feel like that should be exothermic.
- Good job science guy.
(Derek and Santo laughing)
If you were to put your
hand around this tube,
you'll actually feel the heat energy,
the enthalpy of that
transformation evolving as heat.
You ready?
- Yeah.
Oh yeah that's real hot.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
That actually is like burning.
Like I can't keep my hands on it.
- [Santo] No keep your
hand on it, it won't burn.
- Geez that's hot.
- When the stress is removed
and the material goes
back to being austenite,
that phase change is endothermic.
It absorbs heat.
Woo.
(Derek chuckling)
Right?
It's like you could use
that for a refrigerator.
- So it's exactly right.
So another area where these
materials are being applied
is in a field called elastocalorics
where we use this
transformation to do things
equivalent to heat pumping.
- Like heat pumping.
I wanna shoot this with
our thermal camera.
We got a FLIR with us.
How's that?
- This dissipation potential
can act a little bit
like the dissipation in
the shock absorber, right?
So the tire itself could actually perform
some of that dissipation
potential on its own.
- It almost acts as a damper, right?
To get rid of that energy loss.
So then your tire actually has a potential
of becoming a complete suspension system.
- Hmm.
- Which obviously really simplifies
building vehicles for space.
The original tire, when
I put a load on it,
okay you can see I'm
only transferring a load
from the footprint to this little section
of the tire, all right?
By tying this bump stop element to here,
when I go through a footprint,
you can see now I'm
transferring load 360 degrees
around the tire, right?
By doing that, I have now increased
my load carrying capacity significantly
without adding any more mass.
- [Derek] So to make a tire
out of shape memory alloy,
they weave nitinol springs
together into a mesh.
It's a pretty tedious and
time consuming process.
- [Engineer] So you're
gonna take it like so.
- [Derek] Yep.
- [Engineer] You're gonna grab both ends?
- [Derek] No.
- [Engineer] And I'll take it.
- [Derek] No you're not.
- [Engineer] Take it.
- [Derek] Yep.
- [Engineer] And screw it in.
- Oh my goodness.
Are you kidding me?
Is this what you do every day?
- [Engineer] 684 Times.
- [Derek] 684 times-
- [Engineer] Per tire.
- [Derek] But will these wheels work
on rovers on the moon and Mars?
Will they test the wheels extensively
on a rotating carousel of
different terrain types
from sand to small rocks to bigger rocks?
- So the terrain endurance
rig basically consists
of a circular carousel that
is independently driven.
The wheel tire assembly is
also independently driven.
So we can create a force slip condition,
so we can drive with zero slip.
(rover wheel whirring)
And this is about how slow a
Mars rover would be traveling.
Average speed is about 6.7
centimeters per second.
That's a nominal speed,
they don't go too fast.
- All right, I'm gonna go walk
on simulated moon regular.
It looks like beach and
it feels like beach.
This side is meant to simulate
the surface of the moon,
and this side is meant to
be the surface of Mars.
It is very sinky sand.
The wheel is rolling along,
rolling along, it's a rock.
Am I pushing into it or
do I wanna get it on top?
- [Santo] I'd say get on top
and just put all your body weight onto it.
- That's basically my full weight on it.
The shape memory alloy is strong enough
to support the weight of a
vehicle or vehicle and crew,
but it's also incredibly flexible.
So it can deform up to 8% without
being permanently damaged.
And that's what's needed
for long space missions.
- [Santo] So that's a pretty good amount
of deformation, right?
- [Derek] That's a great
amount of deformation.
- [Santo] And still not beyond 8%.
- It's so gooey.
Just walking back to
the car after the beach.
Tricky for a rover, right?
But these tires won't just be for space.
They're also looking at
terrestrial applications.
- Most aircraft, the
tires on those aircraft,
they have to be pressurized
to really, really high
pressurization, 300-400 psi.
Not the conventional 30-60 psi
you do in a car or truck tire, right?
We have issues where at
those huge pressurization
they can explode.
The other construct is maintenance, right?
So if I'm a pneumatic tire
and I'm relying on that pneumatics
for the performance of the system,
I have to always be
checking the air pressure
to make sure that I'm at
the right inflation pressure
so that I'm not burning too much fuel,
or I'm not at a place where I
could potentially pop a tire
because of the loads.
By going to a structural
system that doesn't rely on air
and is designed specifically
for the application.
All of those things go away.
- They've tested one on a Jeep.
Since it doesn't rely on
pressurized air for support,
you just can't get a flat tire.
Plus it can never be under inflated,
which significantly improves fuel economy.
With a metal that works like magic,
you can make airless
tires that will take us
off road, on road, into the
air and across other worlds.
(fire swooshing)
(logo plopping)
NASA's nitinol tires are designed to last
the entire lifetime of a rover mission,
even on a rough terrain of Mars.
But here on earth, few
products last a lifetime.
From bike tires to phones to toothbrushes,
pretty much everything wears out.
But with Henson Shaving,
the sponsor of this video,
you may never need to buy
another razor again in your life.
Henson actually came out of
an aerospace machine shop
that built parts for the
Mars rover and the ISS.
So they are experts in
precise high quality work.
If the temperature to
manufacture their rover parts
changed as little as one degree,
they had to scrap the entire piece.
And that sort of precision is overlooked
by most razor manufacturers.
In a typical razor, the
blades flex and bend
when they make contact with the skin.
And this movement causes micro cuts
leading to skin irritation
and razor bumps.
To many people, this is just
an inevitable part of shaving,
but it doesn't need to be.
You want advice about a good razor?
Trust a guy with a beard.
This is Henson's AL 13 razor.
It's so precise that the blade extends
past the shave plane by
exactly 0.0013 inches.
That's less than the
width of a human hair.
The blade is also securely
fastened at exactly 30 degrees,
leaving almost zero blade flex
for a smoother and cleaner shave.
This razor is designed to last a lifetime,
and it's standard double-edged blades
cost only around 10 cents each.
Which means the cost of
ownership for an AL 13 razor
ends up lower than most
cartridge or electric razors
after only two years.
And besides price considerations,
having one razor for the rest of your life
is both more convenient
and better for the planet.
So if you want one aerospace quality razor
to last the rest of your life,
go to hensonshaving.com/veritasium
and enter code veritasium
for 100 free blades
with a purchase of a razor.
That's two to four years
worth of blades on me.
Make sure to add both
the razor and the blades
to your cart for the code to take effect.
So I wanna thank Henson Shaving
for sponsoring this video,
and I wanna thank you for watching.
