Wildfire
 season
 officially
 wraps
 up
 at


the
 end
 of
 October.
 And
 if
 you
 didn't


see
 the
 flames,
 there's
 a
 good
 chance


you
 smelled
 the
 smoke.


Across
 Canada,
 fires
 are
 getting
 more


frequent
 or
 intense.
 You
 probably
 heard


the
 same
 thing
 about
 storms
 and
 heat


waves.
 That's
 climate
 change,
 and
 it's


making
 extreme
 weather
 our
 new
 normal.


So,
 what
 can
 we
 actually
 do
 about
 it?
 We


can
 tackle
 the
 source
 of
 the
 problem
 by


reducing
 emissions.
 That's
 known
 as


mitigation.
 We
 can
 change
 how
 we
 live


and
 build
 to
 limit
 damage.
 That's
 called


adaptation.
 But
 here's
 the
 question.
 Are


those
 two
 ideas
 in
 conflict?
 Can
 we
 do


both
 at
 the
 same
 time?
 What
 should


cities
 be
 doing
 right
 now
 to
 prepare?


Welcome
 to
 the
 rundown.


[Music]


What
 does
 building
 climate
 resilience


look
 like?
 Annabella
 Bonata
 is
 managing


director
 of
 climate
 science
 at
 the
 INTAC


Center
 on
 Climate
 Adaptation
 based
 at


the
 University
 of
 Wateroo.
 She
 says


Canada
 shouldn't
 just
 respond
 to


disasters,
 it
 should
 also
 prepare
 for


them
 too.


>> Welcome
 to
 our
 program,
 Annabelle.
 How


are
 you?
 Good.
 How
 are
 you?


>> I'm
 doing
 well.
 All
 right.
 We're
 here
 to


talk
 about
 climate
 adaptation.
 What
 is


it?


>> Excellent
 question.
 Um,
 so
 it's
 very


different
 from
 mitigation.
 We
 hear
 a
 lot


about
 mitigation
 in
 the
 media
 for
 maybe


the
 last
 even
 30
 years.
 It's
 been
 more


mainstream
 for
 us
 as
 Canadians
 and
 in


the
 world.
 When
 we
 talk
 about
 adaptation


and
 climate
 change,
 we're
 looking
 at


preparing
 our
 homes,
 our
 communities,


changing
 our
 behavior
 to
 adapt
 um
 to
 the


climbing
 uh
 the
 changing
 climate.
 Um,
 so


with
 changing
 climate,
 we're
 seeing
 more


wildfire,
 more
 flooding
 occur,
 extreme


heat.
 So
 we
 have
 these
 uh
 like
 long
 uh


seasons
 of
 extreme
 heat
 in
 Canada
 now


that
 we
 didn't
 have
 before.
 So
 we
 are


looking
 for
 ways
 to
 really
 adapt
 our


lives
 so
 that
 we
 can
 live
 in
 these


changing
 conditions.
 And
 that's
 really


what
 adaptation
 is.


>> When
 did
 climate
 adaptation
 enter
 the


Canadian
 lexicon?
 When
 did
 we
 start


thinking
 about
 this?


That's
 really
 good
 because
 really
 we've


known
 about
 adaptation
 for
 many
 years.


So
 again,
 it's
 kind
 of
 grew
 up
 with


mitigation,
 but
 nobody
 paid
 much


attention
 to
 it
 because
 it
 felt
 like
 we


were
 giving
 up
 on
 climate
 if
 we
 talked


about
 adaptation.
 But
 over
 the
 last
 10


years,
 there's
 been
 a
 real
 shift
 in


Canada.
 So
 the
 impacts
 from
 climate
 have


only
 gone
 up.
 We've
 seen
 it
 in


financially.
 We've
 seen
 it
 in
 loss
 of


lives.
 So
 adaptation
 has
 really
 entered


the
 conversation.
 And
 I
 would
 say
 it's


become
 mainstream
 in
 the
 last
 5
 years


really.
 Um
 but
 part
 of
 the
 conversation


for
 the
 last
 10.


>> I
 want
 to
 pick
 up
 on
 a
 point
 you
 just


made.
 Um
 if
 we
 are
 focusing
 on
 uh
 the


adaptation
 part,
 are
 we
 sort
 of
 giving


up
 on
 the
 the
 mitigation
 part?


>> No,
 never.
 And
 we
 would
 never
 ask
 for


that
 to
 happen.
 Both
 need
 to
 happen


together.
 And
 that's
 what
 we're
 hearing


more
 from
 people
 across
 Canada
 that
 do


this
 kind
 of
 work.
 We
 need
 to
 uh
 combine


the
 two
 and
 not
 see
 them
 as
 separate.
 If


we
 only
 mitigate
 and
 we
 don't
 prepare


our
 communities
 for
 the
 impacts,
 we're


going
 to
 continue
 to
 feel
 them
 and
 have


losses
 that
 we
 just
 don't
 want
 to
 have,


um,
 the
 impacts
 will
 continue
 to
 be
 felt


from
 climate
 change,
 even
 if
 we
 were
 to


completely
 reduce
 our
 emissions
 today,


just
 from
 how
 long
 it'll
 take
 for
 for


the
 climate
 to
 go
 back
 to
 normal.


>> When
 did
 adaptation
 become
 an
 official


strategy
 here
 in
 Canada?


>> 2023.
 So,
 I
 do
 have
 a
 year.


>> So,
 fairly
 recent.


>> Super
 recent.
 Yeah,
 we're
 still
 kind
 of


learning
 our
 way
 through
 it.
 Um
 the


federal
 government
 released
 their


national
 adaptation
 strategy
 in
 2023


with
 26
 targets
 for
 Canadians
 to
 learn


about
 extreme
 weather
 and
 to
 learn
 what


to
 do
 as
 communities
 and
 at
 the


household
 level
 to
 reduce
 their
 risk.
 Uh


so
 we're
 still
 implementing
 those


strategies
 um
 across
 the
 country.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 being
 done
 on
 it,


but
 it's
 super
 new
 for
 us.


>> I
 want
 to
 get
 into
 some
 real
 world


examples.
 you
 are
 an
 expert
 in


wildfires.
 So
 I
 think
 let's
 start
 with


that.
 Um
 if
 we
 were
 to
 look
 at


adaptation,
 what
 does
 it
 look
 like
 in


the
 terms
 of
 wildfires?


>> There
 are
 different
 levels
 of
 adaptation


for
 wildfire.
 So
 we
 can
 start
 at
 the


home
 level.


>> Yeah.
 There's
 so
 much
 that
 people
 can
 do


and
 I
 I
 kind
 of
 love
 that
 about
 wildfire


about
 adaptation.
 Everyone
 can
 do
 it.
 So


if
 you
 have
 some
 time
 this
 weekend,


we're
 almost
 in
 the
 off
 season.
 Wildfire


season's
 ending,


>> right?
 End
 of
 October.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 This
 is
 a
 perfect
 time


right
 before
 winter
 to
 go
 and
 look
 at


your
 yard.
 Clean
 up
 your
 yard
 if
 there's


any
 dry
 debris.
 Remove
 it.
 Make
 sure


there's
 nothing
 under
 your
 deck
 or


around
 your
 home.
 The
 1.5
 perimeter


around
 the
 home
 is
 really
 important
 to


keep
 as
 clear
 as
 possible.
 Um
 if
 you


have
 mulching,
 consider
 changing
 that
 to


like
 soil
 um
 to
 changing
 it
 to
 rocks
 and


like
 that
 will
 really
 prevent
 your
 home


from
 burning
 or
 being
 in
 danger.
 Um
 most


homes
 burn
 from
 embers.
 So
 even
 if
 a


wildfire
 is
 not
 occurring
 close
 to
 your


community,
 um
 the
 embers
 can
 land
 in


those
 spaces
 and
 ignite
 the
 home.
 So


just
 think
 about
 that,
 clearing
 some
 of


the
 vegetation
 and
 reducing
 some
 of
 the


buildup
 farther
 away
 from
 the
 home.
 So


even
 if
 you
 have
 some
 big
 beautiful


trees,
 just
 try
 to
 maintain
 them
 as


healthy
 as
 possible.
 Remove
 branches
 up


to
 2
 mters.
 Um
 and
 that
 way
 the
 fire
 has


nowhere
 to
 go.
 You're
 just
 cutting
 those


areas
 so
 the
 fire
 can't
 travel.
 Um,
 so


lots
 for
 homeowners
 to
 do
 and
 I
 really


encourage
 them
 to
 to
 look
 into
 that
 and


do
 as
 much
 as
 possible.


>> All
 right.
 So
 let's
 go
 from
 homeowners,


let's
 go
 bigger.
 What
 else
 can
 we
 do


when
 it
 comes
 to
 forest
 whether
 it's


businesses
 or
 municipalities?


>> Yeah.
 And
 there's
 so
 much
 that
 needs
 to


be
 done
 and
 everybody
 needs
 to


participate
 to
 reduce
 risk.
 So


businesses,
 municipalities,
 they
 need
 to


think
 about
 those
 bigger
 projects.
 So


where
 is
 our
 infrastructure?
 Is
 it
 close


to
 forested
 areas?
 Then
 we
 need
 to


create
 fire
 brakes
 around
 those
 areas.


We
 also
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 have
 enough


firefighting
 uh
 water,
 for
 example.
 So,


some
 of the
 fires
 that
 occurred
 in
 2023,


there
 just
 wasn't
 enough
 fire
 uh
 sorry,


enough
 water
 to
 fight
 those
 fires
 off.


So,
 making
 sure
 that's
 always
 up
 to
 par.


Um
 that's
 considered
 adaptation
 and


preparedness.
 Uh
 making
 sure
 that
 people


are
 aware
 of
 their
 risk
 and
 providing
 um


educational
 resources,
 that's
 considered


preparedness
 as
 well.
 That
 doesn't
 cost


municipalities
 or
 businesses
 anything
 to


do.
 Um,
 and
 then
 some
 of
 the
 bigger


things
 are
 how
 we
 design
 our


communities.
 So,
 if
 we're
 thinking
 of


expanding
 communities
 and
 housing
 in


Canada,
 which
 is
 a
 big
 conversation


right
 now,
 where
 are
 we
 going
 to
 build


those
 homes?
 And
 if
 they're
 close
 to
 the


that
 wildland
 urban
 interface
 where


wildfires
 happen,
 um,
 let's
 clear
 some


of
 the
 vegetation.
 Let's
 make
 sure
 that


the
 homes
 are
 wildfire
 resilient
 before


we
 build
 them.


>> I
 do
 have
 a
 question.
 When
 you
 talk


about
 the
 homeowners
 and
 um
 businesses,


what
 we
 learned
 during
 co
 is
 that
 we
 a


lot
 of
 people
 used
 nature
 forests
 as


sort
 of
 a
 third
 space.
 I
 myself
 love


planting.
 I've
 I've
 got
 a
 beautiful


garden
 that
 I
 like
 to
 tend
 to.


>> It
 might
 be
 hard
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who


who
 are
 listening
 to
 be
 like,
 oh,
 you


know,
 no
 mulch,
 none
 of
 that
 stuff
 near


my
 house.
 How
 do
 you
 try
 to
 convince


people
 that,
 you
 know,
 perhaps
 it's
 not


uh
 the
 easiest?
 Because
 they
 might
 have


a
 hard
 time
 with
 that
 as
 well.


>> It's
 such
 a
 good
 point.
 A
 lot
 of
 people


hear
 what
 we
 say
 and
 they
 say,
 "Oh,
 so
 I


have
 to
 remove
 my
 vegetation
 or
 cut
 down


my
 trees."
 We
 would
 never
 say
 that
 cuz


that
 wouldn't
 even
 be
 good
 for
 your


home,
 for
 the
 environment.
 We
 have


pollinator
 gardens.
 There's
 so
 much
 that


we
 care
 about
 outside
 of
 just
 a
 wildfire


risk.
 Um,
 so
 first,
 are
 you
 at
 risk
 of


wildfire?
 And
 if
 you
 are,
 and
 and
 you


should
 know
 from
 what
 we've
 seen
 the


past
 5
 years
 happen
 in
 Canada
 or
 just


speak
 to
 your
 municipality,
 then
 you


should
 start
 to
 implement
 some
 of
 these


actions.
 Now,
 with
 that
 being
 said,


there
 are
 incredibly
 beautiful
 gardens


that
 are
 fireresistant,
 fire
 resilient.


Um,
 Fires
 Smart
 BC
 has
 an
 incredible


list
 of
 plants
 that
 are
 fireresistant.


The
 other
 day
 in
 an
 email
 I
 got
 that


hostas,
 they're
 pretty
 common,
 like
 big


flower.
 Yeah,
 people
 love
 them.
 They're


fire
 resistant.
 I
 I
 didn't
 know
 this.


>> I'm
 not
 a
 big
 gardener.
 Um,
 so
 for


gardeners,
 there
 are
 tons
 of
 beautiful


plants
 that
 they
 can
 plant
 close
 to
 the


home.
 Um,
 and
 just
 maintain
 them,
 keep


them
 moisturized.
 Uh,
 you
 want
 to
 make


sure
 that
 they're
 like
 wet.
 If
 your


plants
 dry
 out,
 you're
 creating
 a
 hazard


for
 your
 home.
 So,
 h
 maintaining
 a
 good


garden
 is
 actually
 perfect
 for
 for
 fire


resilience.


>> You
 talked
 about
 uh
 water
 uh
 keeping


your
 plants
 wet.
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about


flooding
 now.
 Um,
 from
 a
 homeowner's


perspective,
 uh,
 what
 can
 we
 do
 when
 it


when
 we
 talk
 about
 adapting
 to
 flooding?


>> Yeah,
 there's
 again
 tons
 that
 homeowners


can
 do
 that
 residents
 can
 do.
 Um,
 so


look
 around
 your
 home.
 What
 what
 do
 you


have?
 If
 you
 have
 a
 basement,
 um,
 think


about
 your
 valuables,
 for
 example.


That's
 the
 first
 easy
 thing
 that
 you
 can


do.
 Put
 them
 higher
 up.
 So
 even
 if
 you


have
 to
 have
 them
 in
 the
 basement,
 think


of
 some
 shelving
 units
 or
 having


containers
 that
 are
 a
 bit
 w
 water


resistant
 for
 your
 valuables.
 So
 in
 case


that
 your
 fa
 basement
 floods,
 you
 can


protect
 it.
 So
 you're
 looking
 at
 like


about
 30
 cm
 to
 keep
 things
 raised.
 Um


you
 can
 have
 a
 sump
 pump,
 which
 not


every
 home
 can
 have,
 but
 if
 you
 can,


that's
 excellent
 for
 taking
 the
 water


out.
 But
 outside
 their
 home,
 there's
 a


lot
 that
 can
 be
 done.
 Um
 so
 like
 take
 a


walk
 around
 your
 neighborhood
 and
 you'll


see
 that
 with
 the
 leaves
 that
 are


falling
 now
 in
 the
 fall,
 um
 our
 drains


get
 covered
 and
 some
 of
 the
 cleaning


might
 take
 time
 to
 do.
 Um,
 so
 just


clearing
 those
 drains
 will
 help
 the


water
 just
 drain
 when
 it
 comes
 down.
 Um,


looking
 at
 your
 eve
 straws,
 making
 sure


that
 they're
 clear
 as
 well.
 You
 don't


want
 to
 have
 leaves
 in
 them
 so
 that


water
 can
 flow
 through.
 Um,
 and
 the
 last


one
 that's
 pretty
 easy
 is
 extending
 down


spouts.
 So,
 I
 love
 to
 take
 walks
 around


the
 neighborhood
 and
 kind
 of
 look
 at


what
 people
 have
 going
 on.
 Um,
 some


downspouts
 are
 going
 right
 into
 the


foundation.
 So,
 just
 think
 about
 um


extending
 it
 by
 a
 couple
 of
 meters
 into


the
 drain
 uh
 the
 street
 drain.
 And


you're
 already
 doing
 so
 much
 to
 protect


your
 home.


>> What
 can
 the
 city
 do?


>> There's
 a
 lot
 that
 cities
 can
 do
 and


they're
 working
 super
 hard.
 I
 I
 do
 want


to
 commend
 a
 few
 cities
 in
 Canada
 that


have
 dealt
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 flooding
 over


the
 past
 few
 years.
 Um
 we
 have
 older


infrastructure
 in
 some
 cities,
 so
 our


water
 systems
 are
 combined.
 Um
 the
 water


uh
 when
 those
 systems
 were
 built,


climate
 change
 wasn't
 in
 mind.
 So
 they


were
 built
 to
 sustain
 rain
 events
 that


are
 from
 the
 past,
 not
 what
 we
 have
 now.


So
 bigger
 infrastructure
 projects
 are


upgrading
 our
 water
 systems,
 which
 I've


seen
 a
 lot
 this
 summer.
 We
 know
 uh


summer
 is
 construction
 season
 in
 Canada


and
 I've
 just
 seen
 those
 like
 streets


being
 ripped
 up
 and
 people
 might
 be


getting
 upset
 about
 not
 having
 uh
 like


their
 streets
 open,
 but
 there's
 a


reason.
 Exactly.
 An
 excellent
 reason.


Next
 time
 it
 rains,
 your
 roads
 won't
 be


flooded.
 Um
 at
 the
 smaller
 scale,


municipalities
 can
 hand
 out
 information


on
 what
 homeowners
 can
 do
 um
 to
 protect


themselves
 from
 flooding.
 And
 the


biggest
 one
 and
 the
 the
 one
 we
 were


talking
 about,
 you
 know,
 during
 co


people
 like
 to
 be
 outside
 and
 enjoy


nature,
 maintaining
 nature,
 um
 bringing


back
 nature.
 So
 our
 wetlands
 are


incredible
 at
 stopping
 rain,
 at
 cleaning


the
 water,
 too.
 Um
 and
 really
 slowing
 it


down
 so
 that
 flooding
 doesn't
 occur.
 So


thinks
 think
 about
 the
 wetlands
 in
 your


communities.
 Let's
 not
 build
 over


wetlands.
 Let's
 maintain
 them.
 They're


doing
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 for
 us.


>> Does
 Canada
 focus
 enough
 on
 climate


adaptation
 and
 resilience?


>> Uh,
 not
 too
 much.


>> I
 think
 we're
 getting
 there.
 So,
 because


the
 strategy
 just
 came
 out
 in
 2023,


>> it's
 it's
 slow
 to
 be
 implemented.
 Uh
 we


do
 have
 more
 funding
 going
 towards


adaptation,
 but
 currently
 the
 numbers


are
 looking
 at
 like
 if
 we
 have
 $24
 for


mitigation,
 we
 have
 $1
 for
 adaptation.


>> So
 it's
 very
 very
 lopsided
 at
 this
 time.


Um
 but
 we
 are
 seeing
 more
 and
 more


funding
 go
 towards
 it.
 More
 of
 the


conversation
 going
 towards
 protection


and
 preparedness,
 which
 is
 what


adaptation
 is.
 So
 we're
 getting
 there,


but
 we're
 still
 a
 bit
 far
 um
 from
 from


being
 in
 the
 ideal
 place.


>> We're
 talking
 about
 the
 money.
 Let's


talk
 about
 uh
 the
 responsibility.
 Whose


responsibility
 should
 it
 be
 or
 is
 it
 uh


to
 fund
 fund
 it?


>> Yeah.
 Um
 it's
 everyone's
 and
 that's
 a


terrible
 answer,
 I
 know.
 Um
 but
 this
 is


a
 whole
 of
 society
 approach.
 So
 if
 we


don't
 all
 do
 something,
 homeowners,


businesses,
 all
 levels
 of
 government,


we're
 not
 going
 to
 do
 anything
 when
 it


comes
 to
 climate
 change
 to
 mitigation
 or


adaptation.


Funding
 wise,
 if
 we
 do
 really
 want
 to,


you
 know,
 look
 at
 someone,
 I
 would
 say
 a


lot
 of
 the
 funding
 does
 come
 from
 the


federal
 government
 that
 goes
 towards
 the


provinces,
 but
 municipalities
 are
 at
 the


forefront
 of
 climate
 change.
 They're


feeling
 the
 impacts
 and
 they
 are
 the


least
 funded
 when
 when
 it
 comes
 to


levels
 of
 government.
 And
 when
 people's


basement
 floods,
 they
 kind
 of
 just
 say


it's
 the
 government's
 fault
 without


thinking
 which
 level
 of
 government.


Yeah.


>> So,
 more
 support
 to
 municipalities
 is


exactly
 what
 we
 need
 in
 order
 to
 bring


these
 projects
 around.


>> We
 talked
 about
 um
 wildfires
 and


flooding
 and
 sort
 of
 the
 breakdown
 of
 uh


the
 responsibilities
 of
 homeowners
 and


businesses
 and
 municipalities.
 On
 the


other
 end,
 how
 much
 of
 climate


adaptation
 should
 be
 from
 government?


How
 much
 should
 be
 from
 the
 individual?


>> It's
 like
 a
 50/50.
 So,
 um,
 individuals


have
 a
 lot
 that
 they
 can
 do
 themselves


and
 when
 flooding
 occurs,
 when
 a


wildfire
 occurs,
 it's
 you
 who's
 losing.


Even
 if
 you
 have
 ways
 to
 regain
 some
 of


the
 loss,
 um,
 some
 of
 the
 materials


can't
 be
 replaced.
 If
 a
 home
 is
 burned,


you'll
 hear
 the
 stories.
 They're


absolutely
 devastating.
 People
 can't


replace
 what
 they've
 lost.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of


that
 responsibility
 falls
 on
 you.
 Um,


but
 government
 has
 a
 huge
 voice
 in


Canada.
 So,
 if
 they
 were
 to
 create


education
 programs
 to
 really
 raise
 the


awareness
 of
 Canadians,
 um
 I've
 spoken


to
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 this
 past
 summer
 and


they
 didn't
 fully
 understand
 their
 risk


level
 because
 wildfire
 was
 happening
 in


new
 places
 this
 summer
 that
 we
 haven't


seen
 before.
 So,
 it
 felt
 maybe
 moment


mon
 uh
 sorry,
 momentary
 like
 it
 might


not
 occur
 again.
 Um,
 so
 a
 big
 education


program,
 the
 the
 government's
 in
 this


the
 ideal
 position
 to
 make
 that
 happen


for
 Canadians
 so
 that
 they
 can


understand
 and
 also
 provide
 that
 funding


in
 order
 to
 um
 do
 the
 projects.


>> Well,
 you
 say,
 you
 know,
 particularly


over
 the
 last
 couple
 years,
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 are
 uh
 weren't
 prepared
 uh


for
 fires
 or
 floods
 that
 uh
 historically


have
 never
 occurred
 there.
 Um
 but
 do
 you


think
 people
 are
 prepared
 to
 take
 on


that
 responsibility?


some
 it
 can
 be
 a
 lot
 to
 ask.


>> Yeah.
 And
 it's
 it's
 a
 lot
 to
 ask.
 Um
 but


it's
 also
 so
 we
 have
 other
 numbers.
 For


example,
 for
 every
 dollar
 that
 we
 invest


in
 adaptation,
 we
 have
 2
 to
 10
 of
 a


return
 on
 investment
 over
 10
 years.
 So


even
 though
 we're
 asking
 a
 lot
 from


people
 and
 some
 of
 it
 is
 free
 to
 do
 like


cleaning
 out
 your
 eaves,


>> um
 you
 will
 see
 uh
 a
 return
 on
 it.
 And


it's
 hard
 to
 see
 because
 if
 a
 flood


doesn't
 occur
 right
 now,
 you're
 like,


why
 am
 I
 doing
 this?
 But
 if
 it
 were
 to


occur,
 speak
 to
 the
 people
 that
 have


gone
 through
 it.
 We
 have
 lots
 of
 stories


from
 people
 that
 have
 experienced


flooding.
 They
 know
 um
 and
 they
 have


invested
 to
 make
 their
 homes
 flood


resilient.
 Um
 but
 also
 they
 know
 what


the
 mental
 strain
 is.
 So
 it's
 very


difficult
 once
 you've
 gone
 through
 an


extreme
 event
 like
 wildfire,
 like


flooding
 to
 recover
 from
 that.
 The
 next


time
 that
 you
 hear
 there's
 a
 fire
 near


my
 home
 again,
 what
 that
 feels
 and
 the


mental
 strain
 on
 people.
 I
 don't
 think


we're
 asking
 too
 much
 if
 it
 means
 peace


of
 mind
 and
 ownership
 over
 um
 reducing


your
 risk.


>> You
 talk
 about
 the
 emotional
 toll.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 anxiety
 around
 climate


change
 just
 in
 general.
 Do
 you
 think


this
 framework
 of
 adaptation
 and


resilience
 um
 can
 help
 combat
 or
 how
 can


we
 combat
 that?


>> Absolutely.
 Because
 it
 gives
 you


something
 you
 can
 do
 right
 now
 to


protect
 yourself,
 to
 protect
 your
 loved


ones,
 your
 neighbors.
 Um
 so
 when
 we
 talk


about
 adaptation,
 you
 know,
 we
 focus
 on


the
 big
 on
 the
 three
 big
 ones.
 So,


wildfire,
 flooding,
 and
 extreme
 heat.
 If


we
 talk
 about
 extreme
 heat,
 what
 it
 does


is
 make
 people
 sick


>> and
 it
 can
 kill
 people.
 Um,
 this
 puts


something
 in
 your
 hands
 that
 you
 can
 do.


Just
 checking,
 for
 example,
 on
 the


elderly,
 on
 your
 neighbors.
 Um,
 it
 means


that
 you
 can
 really
 reduce
 that
 risk
 and


save
 someone's
 life.
 If
 that
 doesn't


reduce
 some
 of
 your
 um
 climate
 anxiety,


you
 know,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 will
 because


this
 is
 giving
 you
 something
 to
 do
 that


is
 proven
 to
 save
 people's
 lives.


>> Annabella,
 really
 appreciate
 it.
 Thank


you
 so
 much.
 Um,
 I
 think
 the
 one


takeaway
 for
 me,
 at
 least
 the
 ve
 the
 the


most
 the
 easiest
 thing
 that
 I
 think
 I


can
 do
 is
 go
 plant
 some
 more
 hostas.
 I


think
 I
 have
 like
 six
 or
 seven
 already


in
 the
 garden,
 but
 we
 will
 keep
 doing


that.
 I
 need
 more.
 Really
 appreciate
 it.


Thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Oh,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me.


>> Climate
 change
 is
 already
 a
 major
 issue


for
 cities,
 but
 according
 to
 Adam


Squeles,
 part
 of
 the
 solution
 might
 come


from
 nature
 itself.
 He's
 an


environmental
 scientist
 who's
 doing
 a


PhD
 at
 the
 University
 of
 Wateroo,


studying
 how
 urban
 ecosystems
 can
 help


cities
 prepare
 for
 extreme
 weather.


>> Hey,
 Adam,
 how's
 it
 going?


>> Good,
 thanks.


>> Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 joining
 us.
 I
 thought


we
 would
 meet
 in
 the
 park
 since
 we're


talking
 about
 trees.
 It
 seems
 adequate.


Let's
 start
 with
 the
 basics.
 What
 is


nature-based
 solution?
 Yeah.
 So,
 a


nature-based
 solution
 is
 when
 we
 use


nature
 intentionally
 to
 address
 some


kind
 of
 societal
 challenge.
 So,
 the


challenges
 can
 vary.
 You
 can
 lots
 of


problems
 to
 solve
 for
 society,
 but
 uh
 so


you
 can
 kind
 of
 do
 it
 either
 there's


typically
 three
 different
 types
 of


nature-based
 solutions
 where
 you
 can


either
 restore
 nature
 that's
 already


there,
 just
 conserve
 nature
 that's


there,
 or
 just,
 you
 know,
 install
 an


entirely
 new
 park
 or
 create
 a
 whole
 new


forest.
 So,
 build
 something
 from


scratch.
 You
 make
 this
 argument
 of
 of


intentionality
 that
 we
 need
 to
 start


thinking
 about
 nature-based
 solutions.


Why
 is
 it
 important
 in
 urban
 areas
 like


the
 one
 that
 we're
 in?
 We're
 in
 the
 city


of
 Toronto
 right
 now.
 We
 are
 in
 a
 park.


But
 uh
 why
 is
 it
 important
 that
 we
 think


about
 it?


>> I
 think
 it's
 especially
 important
 in


urban
 areas
 because
 these
 natural


environments
 provide
 a
 lot
 of
 benefits


to
 people.
 And
 these
 benefits
 can
 range


from
 providing
 an
 area
 for
 recreation
 or


just
 a
 comfortable
 area
 to
 sit
 outdoors.


Like
 right
 now
 it's
 a
 you
 know
 a
 lot


more
 comfortable
 temperature
 here
 than


if
 we
 were
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 street


something
 like
 that.
 So
 and
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 competing
 interests
 in
 urban


environments
 which
 makes
 it
 uh
 tricky.


You
 know
 lots
 of
 people
 want
 to
 develop


housing
 build
 stores.
 So
 uh
 the


intentional
 part
 is
 uh
 especially
 key


because
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 competing


interests
 for
 land
 uses.


>> All
 right.
 I
 want
 to
 break
 down
 where
 we


can
 use
 nature-based
 solutions
 when
 we


think
 about
 climate
 adaptation.
 So
 we're


going to
 throw
 some
 things
 at
 you.


>> Sure.


>> Extreme
 heat.
 That
 sounds
 like
 an


obvious
 one,
 but
 how
 do
 trees
 and
 nature


help
 with
 that?


>> Yeah,
 so
 multiple
 ways.
 So
 if
 we
 just


take
 a
 tree
 as
 an
 example,
 so
 there's


something
 called
 vapot
 transanspiration


that
 kind
 of
 works
 similar
 to
 how
 people


sweat,
 right?
 So
 it
 helps
 kind
 of
 cool


off
 the
 surrounding
 environment.
 Also,


of
 course,
 trees
 uh
 tend
 to
 provide


quite
 a
 lot
 of
 shade.
 Shade
 makes
 things


a
 lot
 more
 comfortable
 as
 well.
 And
 uh


they
 tend
 to
 absorb
 a
 lot
 less
 the
 heat


than
 uh
 built
 infrastructure.
 So,
 as
 I


talked
 about
 earlier
 with
 the
 road,
 like


the
 road's
 going
 to
 absorb
 a
 lot
 more


heat
 and
 people
 are
 going
 to
 feel
 a
 lot


more
 heat
 compared
 to
 if
 they're
 next
 to


a
 tree,
 for example.


>> Let's
 talk
 flooding.


>> Yes.


>> How
 does
 nature-based
 solutions
 help


with
 flooding?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 in
 a
 similar
 way,
 so
 I
 guess


coming
 back
 to
 the
 evapot
 transpiration


part,
 so
 trees
 will
 absorb
 a
 lot
 of


storm
 water.
 So,
 if
 there's
 a
 huge


storm,
 then
 uh
 all
 the
 trees
 will
 absorb


that
 water
 through
 their
 root
 system
 and


then
 gradually
 um
 evaporate
 that
 water


into
 the
 atmosphere.
 Of
 course,
 they
 use


some
 for
 their
 own
 growth
 as
 well.
 Um,


also
 just
 if
 you
 think
 of
 like
 lawns
 or


soils,
 um,
 that
 permeability
 compared
 to


like
 a
 road
 surface
 really
 helps
 um,


absorb
 the
 storm
 water.
 So,
 it
 stops
 all


the
 storm
 water
 from
 like
 overloading


the
 pipes,
 for
 example,
 where
 you
 can


allow
 it
 to
 just
 slowly
 percolate
 back


into
 the
 groundwater
 system.


>> I'm
 imagining
 astroturf
 is
 not
 something


that
 uh,
 we
 love
 so
 much.


>> Yeah.
 It
 uh,
 doesn't
 have
 all
 the
 same


benefits.


>> Okay.
 Um,
 air
 pollution.
 Yeah,
 that's


another
 way.
 So,
 if
 you
 continuing
 with


the
 example
 of
 a
 tree,
 right?
 So,
 um


some
 air
 pollutants
 will
 actually
 be


absorbed
 directly
 into
 the
 tree.
 So,
 as


a
 trees
 like
 breathing,
 for example,
 but


a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 other
 ones
 like


particulate
 matter
 will
 temporarily
 get


attached
 to
 the
 tree's
 surface.
 So,


>> what
 are
 we
 talking
 about
 particulate


matter?


>> You
 might
 see
 on
 some
 like
 air
 pollution


metrics
 like
 PM
 2.5
 or
 something
 like


that.
 So,
 this
 stuff's
 really
 bad
 for


you
 if
 you
 inhale.
 So,
 um,
 whenever
 like


forest
 fires
 the
 past
 few
 years,
 when
 we


get
 that
 smoke
 in
 this
 area,
 you'll
 be


able
 to
 see
 like
 the
 particulate
 matter


increasing
 and,
 uh,
 you
 can
 feel
 that


when
 it
 gets
 pretty
 high,
 it's
 much


harder
 to
 breathe,
 but
 some
 of
 that


actually
 attaches
 to
 the
 tree
 and
 then


will
 slowly
 get
 like
 pulled
 out
 of
 the


air.


>> Does
 there
 need
 to
 be
 do
 we
 need
 to
 do
 a


better
 job
 at
 uh,
 sort
 of
 bringing
 the


awareness
 of
 not
 only
 trees
 but
 other


sort
 of
 nature-based
 solutions
 to
 the


general
 public?
 I
 I
 I
 mean
 biased
 for
 me


but
 yeah
 I
 think
 so.
 Um
 I
 think
 that
 we


are
 gradually
 getting
 a
 lot
 better.
 So
 I


think
 compared
 to
 like
 20
 years
 ago
 just


from
 me
 like
 reading
 the
 literature
 and


being
 more
 familiar
 with
 it
 these
 types


of
 topics
 and
 uh
 themes
 are
 really


becoming
 a
 lot
 more
 popular.
 Uh


particularly
 with
 climate
 change
 when


we're
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 we
 can


adapt
 to
 you
 know
 extreme
 heat
 and


flooding.
 Uh
 especially
 heat
 I'm
 sure


everyone
 here
 like
 we
 all
 recognize
 that


it's
 getting
 warmer
 and
 warmer
 over


time.
 So
 being
 able
 to
 use
 nature


intentionally
 can
 uh
 really
 help
 in
 that


way.
 And
 I
 think
 some
 people
 might
 be


like
 implicitly
 aware
 of
 these
 things


like
 you
 know
 they
 might
 enjoy
 spending


time
 in
 the
 park
 but
 they
 just
 not
 it


might
 not
 necessarily
 click
 about
 all


the
 benefits
 that
 are
 being
 provided.


>> I
 want
 to
 talk
 regulations.
 Okay.
 What's


available
 for
 developers
 and
 planners
 to


sort
 of
 incorporate
 uh
 nature
 when
 they


build?


>> Yeah.
 So
 there's
 a
 a
 whole
 lot
 that
 can


go
 into
 that.
 Um
 the
 one
 thing
 that
 I


tend
 to
 highlight
 from
 my
 past
 study
 is


uh
 green
 development
 standards
 which
 is


something
 that's
 starting
 to
 become
 a


lot
 more
 popular
 in
 Ontario.
 So
 it


started
 in
 like
 the
 mid
 uh
 like
 2000
 to


2010
 like
 in
 there
 and
 it's
 gradually


expanded
 out
 to
 about
 14
 municipalities


now
 maybe
 a
 little
 more.
 Some
 have
 been


implemented
 in
 the
 past
 few
 months
 I'm


not
 aware
 of.
 But
 uh
 yeah,
 so
 these


types
 of
 standards
 allow
 people
 when


they're
 proposing
 to
 build
 like
 a
 new


subdivision
 or
 something
 like
 that
 or
 a


new
 condo
 building
 um
 how
 they
 can
 um


make
 sure
 that
 the
 development
 is
 more


uh
 environmentally
 friendly
 like


sustainable.
 So
 it
 factors
 in
 aspects


related
 to
 climate
 change
 mitigation
 and


adaptation.


>> You
 mentioned
 14
 municipalities.
 There's


over
 400
 in
 this
 province.
 So
 we're
 I'm


sure
 we're
 a
 bit
 short
 there
 in
 terms
 of


reaching
 some
 goals.
 How
 do
 different


municipalities
 go
 and
 create
 uh
 their


own
 uh
 green
 development
 standards?


>> Yeah.
 So
 there's
 uh
 there's
 some
 wider


partnerships.
 So
 like
 the
 clean
 air


partnership
 is
 an
 organization
 that's


really
 helped
 some
 municipalities
 uh


bring
 these
 forward.
 Um
 I
 think
 now
 that


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 examples,
 people
 will


then
 look
 toward
 the
 other


municipalities
 that
 have
 already


successfully
 implemented
 them.
 So
 the


Toronto
 green
 standard
 was
 one
 of
 the


earliest
 standards
 that
 were
 implemented


and
 I
 know
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 other


municipalities
 have
 referenced
 that


standard
 when
 they're
 creating
 their


own.
 So
 I
 think
 just
 looking
 toward


other
 examples
 and
 building
 up
 from


there.


>> So
 you
 mentioned
 Toronto,
 we're


obviously
 in
 Toronto.
 Tell
 us
 how
 uh
 the


city
 is
 working
 on
 uh
 their
 standards


and
 how
 they're
 sort
 of
 incentivizing


developers
 uh
 to
 consider
 nature
 in


their
 planning.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 that's
 a
 good
 one.
 So,
 uh,


Toronto
 is
 actually
 one
 of
 unique
 in
 a


sense
 where
 they
 actually
 provide


incentives,
 uh,
 financial
 incentives
 for


developers
 to
 go
 beyond
 minimum


requirements
 to
 try
 to
 get
 them
 to
 do


things
 that
 are
 more
 sustainable.
 So,
 an


example
 is
 that
 um,
 so
 I
 guess
 with
 the


Toronto
 Green
 Standard,
 you
 start
 out


there's
 a
 tier
 one,
 so
 it's
 a
 tiered


system
 and
 with
 tier
 one,
 that's
 just
 a


requirement
 for
 all
 development


applications
 that
 uh,
 come
 to
 the
 city.


But
 then
 beyond
 that
 there's
 like
 tiers


two
 and
 three
 and
 those
 are
 actually


optional
 but
 if
 you
 achieve
 those


metrics
 then
 you
 get
 a
 development


charge
 rebate
 as
 part
 of
 the


development.
 So
 there
 is
 a
 financial


incentive
 for
 people
 to
 go
 beyond
 that


and
 uh
 some
 of
 the
 examples
 of
 um
 the


more
 optional
 components.
 One
 would
 be


like
 if
 you
 uh
 try
 to
 quantify
 how
 much


uh
 carbon
 is
 stored
 in
 the
 landscape.
 So


if
 you
 try
 to
 do
 a
 good
 job
 like


incorporating
 vegetation
 and
 having
 uh


try
 to
 help
 reduce
 greenhouse
 gases


created
 from
 the
 development
 so
 you
 can


get
 like
 extra
 credit
 for
 that.


>> Should
 there
 be
 more
 of
 a
 provincewide


standard
 for
 naturebased
 solutions?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that
 would
 be
 helpful


because
 I
 think
 um
 municipalities
 uh


look
 toward
 the
 province
 for
 what
 they


are
 consider
 important.
 So
 um
 we
 have


something
 called
 the
 provincial
 planning


statement
 in
 Ontario.


>> What's
 that?
 And
 then
 so
 that's


something
 that's
 updated
 semi-regularly.


The
 last
 time
 it
 was
 updated
 was
 in


2024,
 so
 last
 year.
 And
 that
 provides


the
 policy
 guidelines
 for
 all


municipalities
 to
 follow.
 So
 then


municipalities
 will
 then
 use
 their
 own


official
 plans
 or
 zoning
 bylaws
 that
 as


long
 as
 they
 conform
 with
 that


provincial
 planning
 statement.
 So
 that


kind
 of
 sets
 out
 the
 broad
 agenda
 for


municipalities.
 And
 one
 and
 it
 covers
 a


whole
 bunch
 of
 different
 aspects
 like
 uh


how
 you
 should
 protect
 people
 from


natural
 hazards.
 So
 protect
 development


from
 natural
 hazards
 or
 uh
 you
 know
 just


build
 things
 more
 energy
 efficient,


support
 transit,
 these
 types
 of
 things.


But
 then
 uh
 another
 part
 of
 that
 is
 also


um
 it
 promotes
 like
 green
 infrastructure


which
 is
 you
 know
 the
 trees
 that
 we're


talking
 about.


>> Is
 there
 more
 that
 can
 be
 done
 with
 that


or
 just
 looking
 at
 it?
 You
 mentioned


sort
 of
 the
 swath
 of
 of
 sort
 of


guidelines
 on
 there.
 Is
 it
 specific


enough?
 Is
 it
 intentional
 in
 the
 way


that
 we
 talk
 about
 naturebased


solutions?
 I
 think
 it
 could
 be
 far
 more


intentional
 with
 how
 it
 supports


nature-based
 solutions
 because
 it's
 um


it's
 supportive
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 it


encourages
 people
 to
 try
 to
 uh


incorporate
 green
 infrastructure
 uh
 low


impact
 development
 these
 types
 of
 things


that
 encourage
 um
 you
 know
 using


nature-based
 solutions
 but
 uh
 it
 could


definitely
 do
 a
 better
 job
 by
 I
 guess


directly
 connecting
 that
 to
 uh
 like


societal
 challenges
 that
 we
 have
 and


encouraging
 those
 nature-based
 solutions


to
 be
 intentionally
 used
 to
 combat


specific
 problems.


>> When
 we
 talk
 about
 regulations,


>> developers
 across
 this
 province
 are


probably
 like,
 great,


>> more
 red
 tape,
 more
 things
 that
 we
 need


to
 go
 through.
 Uh
 the
 city
 of
 Toronto


recently
 uh
 had
 updated
 and
 introduced


thermal
 comfort
 guidelines.
 Another


example
 of,
 you
 know,
 thinking
 about
 how


we
 as
 this
 planet
 gets
 warmer,
 how
 we


can
 incorporate
 it.
 But
 one
 of
 the


things
 and
 criticisms
 were,
 do
 these


things
 have
 teeth?
 Uh
 will
 they
 stand?


And
 also,
 can
 we
 in
 this
 housing
 crisis


that
 we
 have
 have
 more
 regulations?
 Can


we
 handle
 more?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 honestly
 going
 to


be
 a
 question
 that
 never
 goes
 away.
 I


think
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 constant


tension
 between
 um,
 you
 know,
 what's


considered
 red
 tape
 versus
 what
 are


required
 studies,
 like
 required


components
 of
 development.
 I
 think


that's
 something
 that'll
 be
 constantly


negotiated
 into
 the
 future
 and
 that's
 a


key
 part
 of
 planning.
 Um
 so
 I
 think
 as


we
 recognize
 different
 benefits
 of


different
 ways
 that
 we
 build
 um
 you
 know


our
 standards
 will
 evolve
 like
 what
 we


want
 to
 achieve.
 So
 for
 example
 um
 you


know
 30
 years
 ago
 no
 one
 was
 really


talking
 about
 building
 net
 zero
 homes


right
 and
 now
 that's
 something
 that's


going
 to
 be
 in
 the
 building
 code
 soon.


That's
 something
 that's
 supported
 by
 um


the
 current
 provincial
 planning


statement.


>> I
 live
 in
 a
 neighborhood
 in
 the
 city


where
 I
 wish
 there
 were
 more
 trees.
 I


see
 a
 lot
 of
 concrete.
 Uh,
 and
 I'm
 sure


there
 are
 lots
 of
 people
 who
 might
 be


listening
 or
 watching
 this
 and
 go
 like,


well,
 you
 know,
 more
 trees,
 more
 forest


means
 more
 wildlife,
 more
 maintenance,


more
 headaches,
 more
 problems.
 What
 do


you
 say
 to
 those
 people
 who
 can't
 get


past
 uh
 those
 initial
 barriers?


>> Yeah,
 I
 would
 say
 that's
 where
 it
 comes


back
 to
 the
 education
 component,
 I


think,
 where
 we
 can
 really
 share
 and


emphasize
 that
 there's
 pros,
 there's
 not


only
 cons,
 right?
 So,
 I
 I
 mean
 there
 are


definitely
 always
 going
 to
 be
 some
 cons,


right?
 Like,
 you
 know,
 branches
 will


fall
 and
 damage
 property.
 Um
 people
 will


have
 to
 clean
 up
 leaves,
 these
 types
 of


things.
 But,
 um
 there
 are
 still
 those


benefits
 that
 I
 think
 are
 important
 to


emphasize
 and
 reinforce.


>> I
 myself
 love
 raking
 my
 leaves,
 so
 I


will
 always
 uh
 be
 enjoying
 that.
 Adam,


thank
 you
 so
 much.
 This
 was
 really


insightful.
 Really
 appreciate
 it.


>> Awesome.
 Yeah.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.


And
 that's
 it
 for
 the
 rundown.
