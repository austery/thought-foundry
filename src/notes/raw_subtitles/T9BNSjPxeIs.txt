TED really leans into that adage
that comedy does best
at nine in o'clock the morning.
(Laughter)
But I'm so excited to be here.
And as a comedian, I feel like it's my job
to explain to you guys
what makes a TED speaker.
Like, how did these people
become so incredible?
And I'm going to do that by explaining
a little bit about myself.
So I'm an Iranian --
Yeah, thank you, I'm incredible.
(Laughter)
No.
So I'm an Iranian-American
Muslim, like all of you.
(Laughter)
And I have a kid,
and the kid came with a husband.
It was a sort of combo deal.
So I am married.
I'm actually not wearing my wedding ring.
I almost never wear
my wedding ring because it --
I don't want my husband
to get the wrong idea.
You know what I mean?
But my ...
(Laughter)
My husband is Black,
and like I said, I'm Iranian,
which makes our baby "Blaranian."
We had her before all
of the DEI bans, so we didn't know.
But ...
(Laughter)
I should mention
that I speak to her in Farsi
because I'm trying
to radicalize her, and it's --
It'll be a two-person
sleeper cell, obviously.
And ...
She also speaks Spanish
because she's in a bilingual school,
and of course, she speaks English
you know, with her dumb dad,
who only speaks one language.
And ...
You learn a lot about yourself
when you become a parent, right?
And one day I was at the playground,
and I learned something.
When she went down the slide,
she's about 13 months old,
and she went down the slide by herself.
And I wanted to tell her, in Farsi,
"I'm proud of you."
And as I went to say that, I realized,
I don't know how to say
"I'm proud of you" in Farsi,
which suggests that in the 18 years
I lived with my parents,
they never once had occasion to say,
"I'm proud of you."
I had to call my cousin,
she really had to think about it.
She did some research,
digging into, like, ancient Rumi poems
to find an approximate phrase
for "I'm proud."
It's just not something Iranians say.
It's not like the Ayatollah Khomeini
was out there being like,
"I'm proud of you."
You know what I mean?
The phrase got taken out
with the sanctions, you know?
And so ...
My point is, I was never told
"I'm proud of you."
And now I'm a comedian.
So ...
(Laughter)
That explains TED speakers.
That explains how this entire
media empire was built.
So my parenting advice
for all of you is, withhold, OK?
We don't need to hear the compliments.
Withhold.
But one of the things
I really love about TED
is that everyone here is trying
to make the world a better place, right?
And yes, it's fantastic.
It's amazing.
(Applause)
And I also want to throw
one of my ideas into the ring.
But please keep in mind,
I'm a dirtbag comedian.
But nevertheless, I have a directive.
And it has to do with happiness.
Because recently the United Nations
released its Global Happiness Report.
The United States has dropped out
of the top 20 of happiest countries.
Are you guys surprised?
(Laughter)
And before the Canadians get smug,
you guys also dropped in your rankings.
(Laughter)
And so the reason
we've dropped in our rankings
is because of people under 30, OK?
People under 30 are unhappy.
And according to the data, they're unhappy
because they're not going out
and they're not having sex.
OK, they're not having sex.
Now, look, I don't mean to sound
like an old fuddy-duddy,
but in my day,
I used to go out and have sex with every
stranger I could find, in my day.
In my day, I went and I got all the STDs
so that Gen Z could soar, in my day.
Sometimes I had to print out
the MapQuest directions
to a one night stand, in my day.
Sometimes I wouldn't respond
to a drunk text message
because I lost my stylus, OK, in my day.
Now look, in my 20s,
I had the distinct feeling
that people like Gloria Steinem
fought for me
so that I could go out
and have indiscriminate sex.
She marched on Washington
so that I could do a walk of shame
towards a happier society.
(Laughter and applause)
Now ...
The United States is not doing so great,
but do you know who's number one
on the happiness rankings?
Finland.
We're going to let Finland out-pleasure
the United States of America?
What?
What kind of patriots are we?
We should be out there like soldiers
on the sexual battlefield.
The condoms, the whoopsies,
the morning-after pills
yearning to breathe free.
Fourscore and seven dicks ago --
(Laughter)
I probably slept with someone
in this room and --
(Laughter)
And I did it for God,
and I did it for country.
(Laughter)
Now listen, I know you guys are like,
"Man, she's an out of touch,
crotchety old geezer up there."
And I know it sounds like I'm saying,
like, "Oh, get off my lawn,"
but that's not what I'm saying.
What I am saying is, "Get off on my lawn"
(Laughter)
And ...
(Laughter)
Look, you guys, I --
Look, as you can tell,
I'm just an average parent, OK?
A regular mom, as you can tell
from all of this material.
And I have to impart
some wisdom to my daughter.
So while I'm, you know,
implementing the first lesson,
which is withhold,
with a soup√ßon of neglect,
I'll also be teaching her a critical
lesson about global happiness.
Which is that it doesn't matter
what you do in life,
it matters who you do.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
