History has taught us many lessons.
And we should pay attention to its signs
because we might be heading
towards World War III.
One way to understand today's events
is to look for clues from the past.
But cherry-picking historical events
to forecast the future
is a risky exercise that oftentimes
only reinforces our biases.
So I want to do something different.
Instead of comparing historical examples
with what is happening now,
I will examine four
major dimensions of life.
The social, economic, political
and military dimensions.
And I will analyze key trends
within each one of those dimensions
in three critical moments in history:
before World War I,
before World War II and today.
So let's begin with the social dimension.
And there are many factors
that shape societies.
But I want to focus on how
technological innovations have produced
social anxieties and destabilized
societies throughout history.
Before World War I,
The second Industrial Revolution
was transforming life
with electricity, cars,
phones, mass production and more.
While many celebrated these advances,
they also disrupted societies.
For instance, machines replaced workers,
and new farming techniques
uprooted populations from the countryside.
These led to insecurity and resentment.
At the same time,
traditional authorities,
such as churches and monarchies,
they were questioned at that time
and new mass movements, they emerged,
such as labor unions
and nationalist leagues.
People were afraid
that progress was shaking
the very foundation of societies.
Moving a little bit ahead,
in the interwar years
before World War II,
technology continued to affect life.
The word “robot” was even coined in 1921,
and it symbolizes fears
of possibly machines
substituting human jobs.
At the same time, or a little bit later,
the famous economist John Maynard Keynes
warned us in 1930 of a new disease,
namely, technological unemployment.
During this period,
we had communications revolutions
that completely changed public discourse.
So these media became
powerful tools for propaganda,
polarizing politics
and amplifying social fears.
Traditionalists, at that time,
they were worried that modern culture
was simply eroding tradition,
family and religion.
Today,
we are going through a technological
revolution driven by AI,
digital media and social platforms.
The internet, smartphones and social media
have transformed the way we work,
communicate and even think.
Psychologists debate how digital life
is affecting children's development,
while concerns over
privacy and surveillance
and AI-driven job loss continue to grow.
Technologies are spreading
ideas across the globe.
But also they are amplifying frustrations,
fears and divisions
faster than ever before.
In short, technological
progress brings incredible benefits,
but they also breed insecurity,
resentment and uncertainty.
Historically, such anxieties
have made societies more unstable
and vulnerable to extreme ideologies
that fuel militarism and war.
Now let's talk about the economics.
And I want to present two
perspectives on the economics.
The first one is related to a common idea
that economic prosperity prevents wars.
And the argument goes like this.
I mean, it makes no sense for a nation
to go to war and destroy its own wealth.
So they don't want to go to war.
Before World War I, in 1914,
Britain dominated
global trade and finance.
Germany was thriving industrially
and expanding its exports.
Both countries, they knew
that there were no financial benefits
that justify the enormous
economic costs of going to war.
However, World War I
taught us a very important lesson.
Economics may explain what can be done,
but politics decides what will be done.
Fear, ambition, miscalculation,
all overruled by even
the strongest economic success.
Showing us that simply war and peace
are not decided
by economic arguments alone.
We have to take into consideration
political, ideological
and strategic reasons.
OK, so what is going on
with the second perspective?
And the common perspective
says the following.
People assume that nations
want to be wealthy and powerful.
It's not that they
don't want that, they do,
but they want something else.
It's better for them if they are wealthier
or more powerful than their rivals.
Right?
So what matters is the relative power.
I want to be more powerful,
I don't want to be just powerful.
I want to be more powerful
than my enemy or my rival.
Let’s look at what happened
[in] World War II.
And in that moment, Germany and Japan,
they did not see trade
as mutually beneficial.
Why?
They were gaining less than their rivals,
Britain, France and the US,
which made them vulnerable.
What was their response?
Searching for self-sufficiency
and, eventually, war.
Alright, so what is going on today?
There are two main ideas
that we see all over.
The US-China economic interdependence
will prevent war.
Really?
I just told you what happened
in World War I.
Right?
So economics alone do not determine
geopolitical outcomes.
We have to consider political, strategic,
ideological and many other factors.
When we think of what is going on after
or what happened
after the COVID-19 pandemic
and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
At that moment, states
realized that it's too risky
to be really dependent on your rival.
So as nations reassess today,
their economic dependencies,
they are all moving
towards one thing or actually two.
Self-sufficiency and economic nationalism,
just like before World War II.
History reminds us
that wars are not only caused
by economic situations,
but we have to take into consideration
political factors and relative power.
Alright, so let's go
to the political dimension.
Here, I want to talk about polarization.
And polarization
not only divides societies,
but ultimately it might destroy
the political order.
Polarization comes in many forms:
divided media, political battles,
legislative deadlocks,
contested elections and its worst form:
political violence.
And that's when armed groups emerge,
because they don't trust institutions
to resolve the disputes of society.
What do we have in World War I,
before that, actually?
In the Balkans,
there is deep polarization
and many nationalist movements clashing
against the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
And that led to the Serbian group,
the secret Serbian group, Black Hand,
to assassinate Archduke
Franz Ferdinand in 1914.
Which wasn't an isolated event.
It was the result of years
of political violence
in a fractured society
that triggered World War I.
Now what do we have before World War II?
The same situation.
Germany,
the Weimar Republic, was struggling
with escalating polarization,
and violence became common.
Assassinations of key political figures
such as the finance minister in 1921
and the foreign minister in the 1922
that demonstrated this.
Soon, at that time,
all political factions, from the right,
the center and the left,
they had their own militias.
And obviously, this brought instability,
and we know, the rise of authoritarianism
and World War II.
What do we have today?
Very interesting and scary in some ways.
January 6, 2021.
The attack on US Capitol.
Some Trump supporters
contested the result of the election.
That is a clear example
where polarization became violent.
More recently,
several assassination attempts
against President Trump.
Polarization and violence
in the United States
is coming from all sides.
But this is not only the US.
Let's look at Germany.
There is a deep surge or a big surge
in political violence in Germany.
Over the last five years,
more than 10,000 attacks on politicians.
While the far right supporters of AfD
have committed a lot of attacks
against other politicians,
the politicians from AfD themselves,
they are a frequent target
for this political violence.
As you can see, the signs are really big,
and when we analyze what history shows us,
we realize that once armed groups emerge,
compromise becomes impossible
and conflict inevitable.
If polarization nowadays
has reached this level,
society or the political order
is on the brink of collapse.
Now let's go to the final dimension,
the military dimension.
And here, I want to focus on alliances
because they are key to understand
how conflicts become worldwide disasters.
Wars or world wars,
they don't start as global wars.
They begin as regional wars.
And then a regional problem
becomes this big problem
because of the alliances.
Let's take a look at World War I.
Before that, we had a dispute
between Austria and Serbia,
and because of the alliance,
it escalated to become a European war.
And once Britain joined,
it became a global war.
The same thing happened in World War II.
We had three regional conflicts,
separated conflicts,
initiated by three different countries.
Germany wanted hegemony in Europe;
Italy sought an empire
in the Mediterranean and Africa;
and Japan wanted to control
China and Asia Pacific.
World War II only became a world war
when the United States entered the war
after the Pearl Harbor attack.
So how is this related to today?
We already have two regional wars.
Russia in Ukraine
and Iran,
with its proxy wars in the Middle East.
And the third one is taking shape
as China aims to take Taiwan.
Maybe in that third theater
we're going to see more countries joining
and then, as in World War II,
we're going to have
three regional conflicts
that become a global war.
There is another
important aspect of alliances,
which is the level of integration,
how united they really are.
And this is interesting.
When we look at 
the Axis Powers of the 1930s --
Germany, Italy and Japan --
they were not allied.
Actually, they were on opposite sides.
When we look at the crisis
in Austria in 1934
and in Ethiopia in 1935,
Italy was on one side
and Germany was on the other.
When we look at who was helping
China against Japan
until late 1938,
that was Germany.
And then comparing this to today,
we have a new axis being formed.
China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.
Today, they are all united.
Like who sends ammunition,
weapons and even soldiers
to help Russia fight Ukraine?
North Korea.
Who gives food and energy to North Korea?
China.
Who buys Iran's sanctioned oil?
China.
Who buys Russia's gas?
China.
And China supplies Russia
with electronic equipment to keep its war.
As you can see, the axis of today,
which I call the Axis of Dictatorships,
they're really united,
much more than the axis of the '30s.
And on the other hand,
we look at the opposing
alliance, which is what?
NATO and the democracies,
they are falling apart.
And they are breaking,
and they are divided.
History tells us that alliances
are very important.
If we have the aggressor's
alliance growing stronger
and the opposing alliance
becoming divided and weak,
the incentives
for the aggressors to strike,
they are really big.
I'm not here talking
about any inevitable destiny.
But I'm looking for historical patterns
that help us connect the dots.
And with that,
we might not repeat
the mistakes of the past.
And to end,
I want to remind you
of the famous aphorism.
History does not repeat itself,
but it often rhymes.
Thank you.
(Applause)
