 Mania
 imagine
 spending
 the


equivalent
 of
 a
 luxury
 house
 on
 a
 flower


welcome
 to
 the
 1630s
 Netherlands
 where


tulips
 became
 the
 world's
 first


documented
 Financial
 bubble
 and
 taught


us
 lessons
 about
 Market
 psychology
 that


we're
 still
 ignoring
 today
 these
 exotic


Turkish
 Imports
 were
 already
 popular


among
 the
 wealthy
 but
 when
 a
 virus


caused
 rare
 color
 patterns
 in
 the
 pedals


they
 became
 the
 ultimate
 status
 symbol


the
 Dutch
 who
 had
 pioneered
 modern


Banking
 and
 stock
 markets
 were
 about
 to


be
 undone
 by
 flowers


at
 its
 peak
 in
 1637
 a
 single
 Seer


Augustus
 bulb
 sold
 for
 6,000
 Florin


equivalent
 to
 15
 years
 salary
 for
 a


skilled
 Craftsman
 the

 evolved


Beyond

 into

 Changing

 times
 daily
 without
 ever
 leaving
 the

 but
 on
 February
 3rd
 1637
 a


routine
 auction
 had
 no
 buyers
 show
 up


within
 weeks
 prices
 crashed


90%
 The
 Dutch
 learned
 their
 lesson


establishing
 the
 world's
 First
 Financial


regulations
 well
 at
 least
 until
 the
 next


get-rich
 quick
 scheme
 came
 along


speaking
 of


schemes
 the
 Mississippi
 bubble
 remember


how
 the
 Dutch
 at
 least
 had
 actual


flowers
 to
 show
 for
 their
 bubble
 France


was
 about
 to
 prove
 that
 you
 don't
 even


need
 a
 real
 asset
 to
 crash
 an
 entire


economy
 by
 1716
 France
 was
 drowning
 in


war
 debt
 when
 John
 Law
 a
 Scottish


Economist
 and
 professional
 Gambler


convinced
 the
 French
 Regent
 he
 had
 a


brilliant
 solution
 his
 plan
 create
 a


national
 Bank
 issuing
 paper
 money
 backed


by
 shares
 in
 a
 trading
 company
 with


exclusive
 rights
 to
 exploit
 France's


Louisiana
 Territory
 think
 tulip
 Mania


but
 with
 an
 entire
 colony's
 worth
 of


imaginary
 gold
 the
 Mississippi
 company


shares
 skyrocketed
 from
 500
 to
 18,000


lever
 in
 Just
 2
 years
 at
 its
 peak
 the


company
 was
 worth
 80%
 of
 France's
 entire


GDP
 imagine
 if
 one
 company
 today
 was


worth
 $20


trillion
 the
 company's
 Paris
 offices


became
 so
 crowded
 that
 a
 local
 Hunchback


made
 a
 fortune
 renting
 out
 his
 back
 as
 a


writing
 desk
 then
 investors
 started


asking
 for
 real
 money
 instead
 of
 paper


law
 desperately
 printed
 more
 currency


but
 that
 just
 led
 to


hyperinflation
 by
 1720
 shares
 crashed


97%
 and
 France's
 economy
 collapsed
 law


fled
 the
 country
 disguised
 as
 a
 woman


not
 exactly
 the
 exit
 strategy
 they
 teach


in
 economics
 class
 speaking
 of


questionable
 Financial
 schemes
 England


was
 watching
 closely
 and
 thought
 they


could
 do
 even


better
 South
 Sea
 bubble
 if
 you
 thought


the
 French
 scheme
 was
 bad
 the
 British


said
 hold
 my
 tea
 and
 created
 an
 even


bigger


disaster
 1720
 the
 south
 sea
 company
 had


a
 seemingly
 foolproof
 plan
 take
 over


Britain's
 national
 debt
 in
 exchange
 for


Monopoly
 rights
 to
 trade
 with
 South


America
 just
 one
 tiny
 problem
 Spain


actually
 controlled
 South
 American
 trade


and
 and
 was
 at
 war
 with
 Britain
 oops
 but


who
 needs
 actual
 trade
 when
 you
 have


marketing
 the
 company
 promised
 riches


Beyond
 imagination
 and
 even
 gave


politicians
 shares
 to
 promote
 the
 stock


we
 wouldn't
 see
 that
 kind
 of


manipulation
 again
 until
 well
 crypto


shares
 Rose
 from
 100
 to
 1,000
 in
 months


even
 Isaac
 Newton
 invested
 saying
 I
 can


calculate
 the
 motion
 of
 heavenly
 bodies


but
 not
 the
 madness
 of
 people
 this
 from


the
 man
 who
 discovered
 gravity
 about
 to


experience
 a
 different
 kind
 of


falling
 by
 September
 1720
 the
 stock


crashed


90%
 the
 aftermath
 was
 so
 severe
 that
 the


British
 government
 banned
 the
 creation


of
 new
 companies
 without
 Royal
 Charter


the
 world's
 first
 Market


regulations
 though
 as
 we'll
 see
 with


Railways
 in
 about
 120
 years
 regulations


don't
 always
 stop
 human
 nature
 and


speaking
 of
 human
 nature
 let's
 fast


forward
 to
 see
 what
 happens
 when
 you


combine
 speculation
 with
 the
 next
 big


technology


Railway
 Mania
 from
 Trading
 imaginary


Colonial
 riches
 to
 well
 at
 least


Railways
 were


real
 welcome
 to
 the
 1840s
 Britain
 where


the
 Industrial
 Revolution
 was


transforming
 everything
 and
 investors


were
 convinced
 that
 laying
 train
 tracks


would
 be
 like
 printing
 money
 unlike
 our


previous
 bubbles
 Railways
 actually
 did


revolutionize
 the
 world
 trains
 could


transport
 goods
 and
 people
 faster
 than


anyone
 thought
 possible
 the
 first


Railways
 were
 so
 profitable
 able
 that


investors
 rushed
 to
 fund
 any
 track
 that


anyone
 proposed
 sound
 familiar
 we'll
 see


the
 same
 pattern
 with
 the
 internet
 in


about
 150
 years
 at
 its
 peak
 Parliament


approved
 272
 Railway
 companies
 in
 a


single
 year
 track
 proposals
 were
 drawn


on
 maps
 like
 a
 child
 with
 a
 crayon
 one


line
 was
 even
 approved
 to
 run
 straight


through
 Windor
 Castle
 whoops
 the
 British


poured
 more
 money
 into
 Railways
 in
 1847


than
 they
 spent
 fighting
 Napoleon


when
 the
 crash
 came
 over
 half
 the


proposed
 Railways
 were
 never
 built
 turns


out
 just
 because
 something
 will
 change


the
 world
 doesn't
 mean
 every
 investment


in
 it
 will
 make
 money
 the
 dotom


investors
 would
 learn
 this
 lesson
 the


hard
 way
 but
 we're
 getting
 ahead
 of


ourselves
 speaking
 of
 getting
 ahead
 of


ourselves
 the
 Great
 Depression
 while
 the


British
 were
 learning
 their
 Railway


lessons
 across
 the
 Atlantic
 America
 was


busy
 creating
 the
 perfect
 conditions
 for


the
 mother
 of
 all
 crack
 es
 The
 Roaring


20s
 were
 in
 full
 swing
 the
 war
 was
 over


the
 economy
 was
 booming
 and
 everyone
 was


convinced
 stocks
 could
 only
 go
 up
 sounds


familiar
 yet
 by
 1928
 ordinary
 Americans


were
 borrowing
 money
 just
 to
 buy
 stocks


Banks
 were
 happy
 to
 lend
 letting
 people


buy
 shares
 with
 just
 10%
 down
 think
 of


it
 as
 a
 mortgage
 but
 for
 stocks
 what


could
 possibly
 go
 wrong
 meanwhile


sketchy
 investment
 trusts
 were
 popping


up
 faster
 than
 speak
 easys
 during


prohibition
 our
 October
 24th


1929
 the
 market
 wobbled
 October
 28th
 it


fell
 October
 29th
 Black
 Tuesday
 it


collapsed
 the
 Dow
 lost
 25%
 in
 2
 days


equivalent
 to
 A1
 trillion
 loss
 today


those
 borrowed
 shares
 Banks
 wanted
 their


money
 back
 forcing
 investors
 to
 sell
 at


any
 price
 but
 unlike
 our
 previous


bubbles
 this
 crash
 infected
 the
 entire


economy
 by
 1932
 stocks
 had
 lost
 89%
 of


their
 value
 unemployment
 hit


25%
 and
 5,000
 Banks
 collapsed
 the
 world


learned
 you
 couldn't
 just
 let
 markets


regulate
 themselves
 well
 at
 least
 until


the
 1980s
 when
 Japan
 decided
 to
 give
 it


a


try
 Japanese
 asset
 bubble
 welcome
 to
 the


1980s
 Japan
 where
 they
 weren't
 content


with
 just
 one
 bubble
 they
 created
 two
 at


once
 the
 economy
 was
 booming
 so
 hard


that
 experts
 predicted
 it
 would
 overtake


America
 Japanese
 companies
 were
 buying


up
 everything
 from
 Hollywood
 Studios
 to


the
 Rockefeller
 Center
 remember
 how
 we


mentioned
 Market
 psychology
 way
 back
 in


the
 Tulip
 crisis
 the
 Japanese
 stock


market
 soared
 450%
 in
 the
 80s
 but
 that


was
 nothing
 compared
 to
 real
 estate


Tokyo
 real
 estate
 got
 so
 expensive
 that


the
 grounds
 of
 the
 Imperial
 Palace
 were


theoretically
 worth
 more
 than
 all
 the


real
 estate
 in
 California
 one
 square


meter
 in
 Tokyo's
 Ginza
 District


$300,000
 a
 parking
 spot
 could
 could
 cost


$1.5


million
 the
 perfect
 Financial
 storm
 was


brewing
 Japanese
 Banks
 were
 lending


money
 against
 inflated
 real
 estate
 which


was
 used
 to
 buy
 more
 stocks
 which
 were


used
 as
 collateral
 for
 more
 loans
 to
 buy


more
 real
 estate
 if
 this
 sounds
 like
 a


circular
 problem
 waiting
 to
 happen
 well


you're
 getting
 better
 at
 spotting


bubbles
 by
 1989
 reality
 finally
 caught


up
 the
 crash
 was
 so
 severe
 that
 Japan's


economy
 still
 hadn't
 recovered
 30
 years


later
 they
 even
 have
 a
 a
 name
 for
 it
 the


Lost
 decades
 but
 while
 Japan
 was
 dealing


with
 its
 hangover
 the
 rest
 of
 Asia
 was


about
 to
 learn
 some
 hard


lessons
 Asian
 financial
 crisis
 just
 when


everyone
 thought
 Asian
 economies
 were


Invincible
 Thailand
 decided
 to
 teach
 the


world
 a
 lesson
 about
 hidden
 risks
 it


started
 with
 something
 seemingly
 boring


Thailand's
 currency
 the
 bot
 was
 pegged


to
 the
 US
 dollar
 local
 companies
 were


borrowing
 in
 dollars
 and
 Living
 Large


the
 problem
 their
 income
 was
 in
 bot
 they


of
 it
 like
 taking
 out
 a
 loan
 in
 Gold
 to


buy
 a
 house
 but
 getting
 paid
 in
 Monopoly


money
 it
 works
 great
 until
 the
 exchange


rate
 moves
 when
 Thailand's
 export
 growth


slowed
 investors
 started
 questioning
 if


the
 bot
 was
 really
 worth
 what
 the


government
 claimed
 on
 July
 2nd


1997
 Thailand
 ran
 out
 of
 dollars


defending
 the
 bot
 the
 currency
 crashed


50%
 almost
 overnight
 and
 companies


suddenly
 owed
 twice
 as
 much
 on
 their


dollar
 loans
 but
 here's
 where
 it
 gets


interesting
 investors
 looked
 at


neighboring
 countries
 and
 thought


hey
 they're
 doing
 the
 same
 thing
 like


dominoes
 Malaysia
 Indonesia
 and
 South


Korea
 watched
 their
 currencies
 collapse


Indonesia's
 rupia
 lost
 80%
 of
 its
 value


in
 months
 the
 IMF
 had
 to
 step
 in
 with


$40
 billion
 in
 bailouts
 the
 world


learned
 that
 in
 a
 connected
 economy
 one


country's
 problem
 can
 quickly
 become


everyone's
 problem
 a
 lesson
 the
 world


would
 need
 to
 relearn
 in
 2008
 when


American
 mortgages
 triggered
 a
 global


meltdown
 but
 before
 we
 get
 there
 Silicon


Valley
 was
 about
 to
 show
 us
 how


interconnected
 the
 world
 could
 really


become
 com
 bubble
 remember
 how
 Railway


Mania
 convinced
 investors
 that
 tracks
 to


Nowhere
 were
 worth
 a
 fortune
 in
 the


1990s
 Silicon
 Valley
 proved
 that
 you


didn't
 even
 need
 tracks
 just
 add
 to
 your


company
 name
 and
 watch
 the
 money
 roll
 in


the
 internet
 was
 revolutionary
 no
 doubt


but
 investors
 were
 so
 scared
 of
 missing


out
 on
 the
 next
 Microsoft
 that
 they


threw
 money
 at
 anything
 with
 a
 website


companies
 were
 going
 public
 without
 ever


making
 a
 profit
 some
 without
 even
 having


a
 product
 pets.com
 raised
 $82
 million
 in


an
 IPO
 despite
 losing
 money
 on
 every


sale
 but
 hey
 growth
 over
 profits
 right


the
 NASDAQ
 soared
 from
 500
 to
 5,000


between
 1990
 and
 2000
 internet


entrepreneurs
 were
 becoming
 billionaires


overnight
 at
 its
 peak
 a
 tiny
 software


company
 called
 Qualcomm
 saw
 its
 stock


rise
 2600%
 in
 one
 year
 that
 makes
 our


Dutch
 tulet
 prices
 look
 reasonable
 March


2000
 reality
 kicked
 in
 by
 October
 2002


the
 NASDAQ
 had
 lost
 78%
 of
 its
 value


Amazon's
 stock
 fell
 from


$17
 to


$7
 most
 Dooms
 disappeared
 entirely
 just


like
 Railways
 though
 the
 technology
 that


sparked
 the
 Mania
 did
 change
 everything


even
 if
 most
 investors
 lost
 their
 shirts


betting
 on
 the
 wrong
 companies
 with
 tech


stocks
 and
 ruins
 investors
 started


looking
 for
 something
 more
 real
 to
 put


their
 money
 in
 oil
 gold
 wheat
 surely


Commodities
 couldn't
 crash
 like
 internet


stocks


right
 Commodities
 bubble
 after
 getting


burned
 by
 imaginary
 profits
 from
 dotom


companies
 investors
 wanted
 something


real
 oil
 you
 could
 touch
 gold
 you
 could


hold
 wheat
 you
 could
 eat
 what
 could
 be


safer
 than
 actual
 physical
 stuff
 by
 2006


everyone
 from
 Pension
 funds
 to
 small


investors
 was
 piling
 into
 Commodities


oil
 soared
 from
 $50
 to
 $147
 a
 barrel


gold
 doubled
 to
 over
 $1,000
 an
 ounce


rice
 prices
 tripled
 causing
 food
 riots


in
 some
 countries
 even
 basic
 metals
 like


copper
 hit
 all-time
 highs
 the
 story
 was


simple
 China's
 booming
 economy
 would


need
 endless
 raw
 materials
 and
 supplies


couldn't
 keep
 up
 Wall
 Street
 saw
 an


opportunity
 creating
 complex
 Financial


products
 that
 let
 anyone
 bet
 on


commodity
 prices
 suddenly
 your


retirement
 fund
 could
 speculate
 on
 wheat


futures
 because
 what
 could
 go
 wrong


mixing
 pensions
 with
 food
 speculation
 by


mid2
 2008
 the
 bubble
 burst
 spectacularly


oil
 crashed
 back
 to


$30
 gold
 tumbled
 food
 prices
 collapsed


but
 this
 crash
 wasn't
 happening
 in


isolation
 it
 was
 just
 one
 part
 of
 a


perfect
 storm
 brewing
 in
 the
 Global


Financial
 system
 remember
 all
 those


fancy
 Financial
 products
 Wall
 Street


created
 they
 had
 some
 other
 ideas
 about


housing


too
 the
 housing
 crisis
 while
 Commodities


were
 booming
 Wall
 Street
 had
 discovered


something
 even
 better
 the
 American
 dream


itself
 after
 all
 house
 prices
 never
 go


down
 right
 it
 started
 innocently
 enough


low
 interest
 rates
 meant
 more
 people


could
 afford
 homes
 Banks
 were
 happy
 to


lend
 they
 just
 bundle
 those
 mortgages


into
 complex
 Securities
 and
 sell
 them
 to


investors
 worldwide
 soon
 they
 ran
 out
 of


qualified
 borrowers
 but
 why
 let
 that


stop
 a
 good


thing
 enter
 the
 subprime
 mortgage
 loans


to
 anyone
 with
 a
 pulse
 remember
 how


Japanese
 banks
 used
 real

 as


collateral
 for
 more

 Wall

 you

 mortgage
