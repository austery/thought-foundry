 The
 Wealth
 of
 Nations
 by
 Adam


Smith
 the
 book
 that
 launched
 a
 thousand


economics
 degrees
 and
 probably
 as
 many


arguments
 published
 in


1776
 when
 America
 was
 declaring


independence
 Smith
 was
 declaring
 war
 on


mercantilism
 with
 the
 most
 influential


economic
 mic
 drop
 in
 history
 his


invisible
 hand
 concept
 explained
 Market


forces
 so
 elegantly
 that
 economists


spent
 the
 next
 200
 years
 trying
 to
 comp


at
 it
 back
 up
 again
 the
 book
 introduced


revolutionary
 ideas
 like
 division
 of


labor
 using
 the
 humble
 example
 of
 a
 pin


Factory
 to
 explain
 productivity
 though


today's
 Tech
 CEOs
 still
 cite
 it
 while


pretending
 they
 discovered
 efficiency


Smith's
 Central
 message
 that
 free


markets
 and
 self-
 interest
 could
 serve


the
 common
 good
 change
 the
 world
 even
 if


today's
 interpretation
 is
 slightly
 more


greed
 is
 good
 but
 while
 Smith
 was


explaining
 how
 markets
 work
 our
 next


author
 was
 about
 to
 show
 us
 how


spectacularly
 they
 could
 fail


number
 two
 the
 general
 theory
 of


employment
 interest
 and
 money
 by
 John


mayard
 KES
 isn't
 just
 an
 economic


Masterpiece
 it's
 history's
 most
 elegant


I
 Told
 You
 So
 released
 in
 1936
 when


classical
 economists
 were
 still


insisting
 markets
 would
 fix
 themselves


kanes
 basically
 wrote
 an
 entire
 book


saying
 have
 you
 tried
 actually
 looking


outside
 his
 revolutionary
 Insight
 that


government
 spending
 could
 fight


recessions
 was
 like
 suggesting
 Chicken


Soup
 for
 a
 cold
 simple
 effective
 and


somehow
 nobody
 thought
 of
 it
 earlier
 the


book
 demolished
 classical
 economics
 so


thoroughly
 that
 even
 kan's
 Rivals
 had
 to


admit
 he
 was
 on
 to
 something
 though
 they


did
 so
 very
 very
 quietly
 his
 framework


for
 understanding
 aggregate
 demand
 and


employment
 still
 drives
 policy
 today
 but


while
 kees
 was
 revolutionizing


macroeconomics
 our
 next
 authors
 were


about
 to
 turn
 human
 behavior
 into
 a


mathematical


game
 number
 three
 theory
 of
 games
 and


economic
 behavior
 by
 John
 Von
 noyman
 and


Oscar
 Morgan
 Stern
 is
 what
 happens
 when


a
 mathematician
 and
 an
 econom


walk
 into
 a
 bar
 and
 decide
 to
 explain


human
 behavior
 with
 pure
 logic
 published


in
 1944
 it
 took
 economics
 from
 educated


guesswork
 to
 mathematical
 Precision


though
 some
 economists
 are
 still


recovering
 from
 the
 equations
 their
 game


theory
 framework
 explained
 everything


from
 nuclear
 deterrence
 to
 why
 your
 kids


won't
 clean
 their
 room
 without
 rewards


the
 book
 transformed
 how
 we
 understand


strategic
 decision-
 making
 even
 if
 most


people
 only
 pretend
 to
 understand
 the


prisoners
 dilemma
 it's
 impact
 reached


far
 beyond
 economics
 into
 psychology


political
 science
 and
 even
 biology
 but


while
 game
 theory
 was
 explaining
 human


rationality
 our
 next
 author
 was
 about
 to


show
 why
 governments
 shouldn't
 keep


their
 hands
 off
 the


economy
 number
 four
 capitalism
 and


Freedom
 by
 Milton
 fredman
 is
 what


happens
 when
 Chicago
 gets
 tired
 of


Cane's
 having
 all
 the
 fun
 published
 in


1962
 fredman
 launched
 an
 intellectual


Revolution
 by
 suggesting
 that
 maybe
 just


maybe
 the
 government
 wasn't
 the
 solution


to
 every
 problem
 his
 defense
 of
 free


markets
 was
 so
 powerful
 that
 politicians


still
 quote
 it
 today
 usually
 right
 after


passing
 another
 regulation
 the
 books


argument
 that
 economic
 freedom
 is


inseparable
 from
 personal
 Liberty


transformed
 policymaking
 though
 some


Nations
 missed
 the
 memo
 fredman's
 ideas


about
 monetary
 policy
 school
 choice
 and


floating
 exchange
 rates
 went
 from


radical
 to
 mainstream
 faster
 than
 you


can
 say
 inflation
 is
 always
 and


everywhere
 a
 monetary
 phenomenon


but
 while
 fredman
 was
 advocating
 for


free
 markets
 our
 next
 author
 was
 about


to
 show
 us
 how
 to
 actually
 profit
 from


them
 number
 five
 the
 intelligent


investor
 by
 Benjamin
 Graham
 is
 the


investment
 equivalent
 of
 being
 told
 to


eat
 your
 vegetables
 boring
 but
 good
 for


you
 published
 in


1949
 when
 most
 investors
 were
 still


throwing
 darts
 at
 stock
 Pages
 Graham


introduced
 revolutionary
 Concepts
 like


maybe
 know
 what
 you're
 buying
 and
 don't


follow
 the
 crowd
 off
 a
 cliff
 his
 m


Market
 metaphor
 explained
 Market


psychology
 so
 perfectly
 that
 therapists


should
 probably
 assign
 it
 to
 day
 Traders


the
 book's
 message
 about
 emotional


discipline
 and
 margin
 of
 safety
 turned
 a


young
 Warren
 Buffett
 from
 a
 numbers
 nerd


into
 the
 world's
 greatest
 investor


though
 Graham
 probably
 didn't
 expect
 his


student
 to
 buy
 entire
 companies
 but


while
 Graham
 was
 teaching
 us
 to
 be


fearful
 when
 others
 are
 greedy
 our
 next


author
 was
 about
 to
 show
 us
 how
 to
 spot


the
 next

 number
 six
 Common
 Stocks
 and
 uncom


common
 profits
 by
 Philip
 Fischer
 is
 what


happens
 when
 someone
 realizes
 talking
 to


cafeteria
 workers
 about
 their
 company
 is


better
 than
 staring
 at
 spreadsheets
 all


day
 published
 in
 1958
 fer
 revolutionized


investing
 by
 suggesting
 radical
 ideas


like
 actually
 visit
 the
 company
 and
 talk


to
 employees
 truly
 groundbreaking
 stuff


his
 famous
 scuttlebutt
 method
 was


basically
 corporate
 Espionage
 minus
 the


Espionage
 though
 modern
 compliance


departments
 might
 disagree
 the
 book


introduced
 the
 radical
 notion
 that
 maybe


growing
 companies
 are
 worth
 more
 than


dying
 ones
 with
 good
 balance
 sheets


Fisher's
 15
 points
 for
 finding


exceptional
 companies
 became
 the
 growth


investors
 Bible
 but
 while
 fiser
 was


teaching
 us
 about
 quality
 businesses
 our


next
 author
 was
 about
 to
 show
 us
 how
 to


spot
 market
 bubbles
 from
 a
 mile


away
 number
 seven
 security
 analysis
 by


Benjamin
 Graham
 and
 David
 Dodd
 is
 the


original
 Bible
 of
 value
 investing
 that


would
 later
 spawn
 the
 intelligent


investor
 published
 in
 1934
 fresh
 from


the
 market
 crash
 this
 more
 technical


Masterpiece
 laid
 the
 mathematical


foundation
 for
 modern
 investment


analysis
 while
 Graham
 would
 later
 write


the
 eat
 your
 vegetables
 version
 for


individual
 investors
 this
 was
 The


Graduate
 level
 course
 that
 taught
 Wall


Street
 how
 to
 actually
 price
 a
 business


their
 systematic
 approach
 introduced


revolutionary
 Concepts
 like
 intrinsic


value
 and
 margin
 of
 safety
 at
 a
 time


when
 stock
 tips
 were
 basically
 fortune


cookie
 readings
 but
 while
 Graham
 and


Dodd
 were
 creating
 the
 science
 of


security
 analysis
 our
 next
 author
 was


about
 to
 show
 us
 the
 art
 of
 trading


through
 the
 most
 entertaining
 biography


and


finance
 number
 eight
 reminiscences
 of
 a


stock
 Operator
 by
 Edwin
 leev
 is
 wall


Street's
 greatest
 story
 that's


technically
 not
 a
 biography
 but


definitely
 is
 published
 in
 1923
 it


follows
 Jesse
 Livermore
 disguised
 as


Larry
 Livingston
 in
 what
 might
 be


history's
 most
 expensive
 autobiography


since
 Livermore
 wouldn't
 admit
 it
 was


him
 through
 fictional
 Tales
 of
 bucket


shops
 and
 Market
 Corners
 it
 reveals


Timeless
 wisdom
 like
 the
 market
 is
 never


wrong
 and
 your
 worst
 enemy
 is
 yourself


though
 Livermore
 himself
 tragically


proved
 the
 latter
 the
 book's
 insights


about
 Market
 psychology
 and
 trading


remain
 so
 relevant
 that
 modern
 hedge


funds
 still
 give
 it
 to
 analysts
 hoping


they'll
 learn
 from
 livermore's
 triumphs


rather
 than
 his
 tragic
 end
 but
 while


Livermore
 was
 teaching
 us
 about
 trading


our
 next
 author
 was
 about
 to
 show
 us
 why


most
 Traders
 should
 just
 buy
 index
 funds


number
 nine
 when
 genius
 failed
 by
 Roger


Lowenstein
 is
 a
 story
 of
 how
 the
 world's


smartest
 mathematical
 Minds
 proved
 that


being
 really
 really
 good
 at
 math
 doesn't


prevent
 you
 from
 losing

Management's

1998
 it
 shows
 how
 Nobel

 winners


armed
 with
 the
 most
 sophisticated
 models


in
 history
 managed
 to
 lose
 $4
 billion


faster
 than
 you
 can
 say
 Leverage
 is


dangerous
 the
 book
 reveals
 how
 ltcm's


can't
 lose

proving
 that
 even
 genius
 has
 its
 limits


especially
 especially
 when
 you're


borrowing
 100
 times
 your
 money
 Wall


Street
 still
 uses
 pulling
 and

 as


code
 for
 career-ending
 hubis
 but
 while


ltcm
 was
 blowing
 up

 World


our

of

 TB
 showed


that
 the
 most
 important
 events
 in


history
 were
 never
 predicted
 by
 experts


who
 were
 too
 busy
 calculating
 the
 99th


percentile
 while
 missing

 of

 and


anti-fragility


revolutionized

 though


some
 are
 still
 recovering
 from
 learning


their
 entire

the

 power
 of

 the


book's
 Central
 message
 the
 most


significant

 are
 by

 the


ones
 no

 made
 the

jackets

 at

 other
 to


computers
 silently

 running
 your


grandma's

 published


in

 how

through
 the

 as

 in
 1986
 when

 Minsky

 Thinking

 by
 Daniel


Conan
 is
 what

 when

psychologist
 spends
 his

 proving


that
 smart
 people
 are
 just
 as
 dumb
 as


the
 rest
 of

 just
 in

 ways
 this


Nobel

 winner
 showed
 that
 our
 brain


have
 two
 systems
 one
 that
 jumps
 to


conclusions
 faster
 than
 a
 cat
 chasing
 a


laser
 pointer
 and
 another
 that's


basically
 a
 lazy
 teenager
 who
 can't
 be


bothered
 to

 if
 those

make

 through
 brilliant
 experiments


conoman
 revealed
 why
 we

 about
 everything
 from

 the
 book's


impact
 on
 economics
 was
 so
 profound
 that


efficient

 are
 still
 in


therapy
 but
 while
 Conan
 was

 irrational

 by


Robert
 Schiller
 is
 the
 rare
 book
 that


predicted
 not
 one

 two
 market
 bubbles


making
 him
 the
 economic
 equivalent
 of


that
 weatherman
 who
 actually
 gets
 the


forecast
 right
 published
 in
 2000
 right


before
 the

 popped
 Schiller


explained
 why
 investors
 were
 acting
 like


tulip

 were
 back
 in

 he


showed
 how
 human
 psychology
 turns
 normal


Market
 Cycles
 into
 massive

though
 most

 were

 busy
 buying

 right
 after

 that
 humans
 have
 the
 emotional

 how

 the
 financial


equivalent
 of

 Murphy
 showed


that
 those

 on

screens
 aren't
 just
 modern
 art
 projects


He
 transformed
 pattern
 recognition
 from


Mystic
 Wisdom
 into
 a
 science
 though
 some


fundamental
 analysts
 still
 think
 it's


about
 as
 reliable
 as

 the

turned
 Concepts
 like

and

 lines
 into
 a
 legitimate


discipline
 even
 if
 most

 still


can't
 tell
 a

 schwager
 somehow
 convinced
 the

 by

 it

 a


handful
 of
 Outsiders
 who
 figured
 out
 the


housing
 market
 was
 basically
 a
 giant


Ponzi
 scheme
 with

 Lewis


showed
 how
 a
 few
 Skeptics
 made
 billions


betting
 against
 cdos
 that
 nobody


understood
 including
 the
 people
 selling


them
 through
 characters
 like
 Dr
 Michael


bur
 who
 read
 thousands
 of

 when


everyone

 was

 Dalo
 revealed
 that

 is


basically
 just

 with

 his

explained
 how

 with
 the


clarity
 of
 a
 kindergarten
 teacher
 who


happens
 to
 manage
 $150

 through


personal
 stories
 of

 he
 showed
 that


radical
 transparency
 and
 systematic


thinking
 are
 the
 keys
 to
 success
 though


maybe
 warn
 your
 co-workers
 before


implementing
 his
 radical

approach

 is
 what
 happens


when
 a
 French
 Economist
 spends
 15
 years


proving
 that
 the
 rich
 aren't
 just


getting
 richer
 they're
 doing
 it
 faster


than
 you
 can
 say
 inherited
 wealth


published
 in


2013
 it
 became
 an
 unlikely
 bestseller
 by


turning
 economic
 data
 into
 a
 detective


story
 spanning
 centuries
 his
 famous


formula
 R
 greater
 than
 GE
 showed
 that


when
 investment
 returns
 exceed
 economic


growth
 wealth
 inequality
 explodes
 like
 a


financial
 physics
 experiment
 gone
 wrong


the
 book
 sparked
 Global
 debates
 about


inequality
 though
 most
 billionaires


probably
 used
 it
 as
 an
 expensive
 paper


weight


pik's
 mountain
 of
 historical
 evidence


changed
 how
 we
 think
 about
 wealth
 but


while
 he
 was
 exposing

 shanberg
 is
 what


happens
 when
 America
 realizes
 that
 maybe


just
 maybe
 letting
 workers
 contribute


ideas
 is
 better
 than
 treating
 them
 like


robots
 published
 in
 1981
 when
 us


manufacturers
 were
 getting
 crushed
 by
 by


Japanese
 competition
 it
 revealed
 the


secret
 sauce
 behind
 Japan's
 economic


Miracle
 turns
 out
 asking
 the
 person


doing
 the
 job
 how
 to
 improve
 it
 works


better
 than
 having
 Consultants
 write


reports
 about
 it
 the
 book
 introduced


Concepts
 like
 Kaizen
 and
 just
 in
 time
 to


the
 West
 though
 most
 companies


implemented
 them
 about
 as
 well
 as
 they


pronounced
 them
 from
 Toyota
 to
 Sony


shanberg
 showed
 why
 Japan
 was
 winning


the
 quality
 War
 but
 while
 America
 was


learning
 about

 production
 our

 the

Economist
 by

 ishibashi
 is
 what

 when
 East
 Meets
 West
 in
 economic


thought
 and
 both
 sides
 realize
 they've


been
 doing
 it
 wrong
 published
 in
 1934


ishibashi
 dared
 to
 challenge
 Japan's


military-industrial
 complex
 while


explaining
 why
 Pure
 Western
 capitalism


wouldn't
 work
 in
 Asia
 either
 through
 his


newspaper
 and
 writings
 he
 promoted
 a


unique
 blend
 of
 free
 market
 principles


and
 Asian
 social
 values
 though


suggesting
 moderation
 in
 1930s
 Japan
 was


about
 as
 popular
 as
 suggesting
 peace
 his


insights
 about
 balancing
 economic
 growth


with
 social
 harmony
 would
 later
 help


shape
 Japan's
 post-war
 economic
 Miracle


but
 while
 ishibashi
 was
 bridging
 East


and
 West

 is


what

 when
 someone
 finally


explains
 rocket
 science

 math


in
 a
 way
 that
 doesn't
 require
 a
 PhD
 in


physics
 published
 in
 1988
 just
 as
 Wall


Street
 was
 discovering
 it
 could
 make


money
 by
 confusing
 people
 Hull
 managed


to
 make
 black
 skulls
 sound
 almost
 as


simple
 as
 addition
 the
 book
 became
 the


derivatives
 Bible
 though
 understanding


it
 fully
 still
 requires
 more
 coffee
 than


the
 average
 human
 can
 safely
 consume


through
 clear
 explanations
 of
 options


swaps
 and
 Futures
 Hull
 showed
 that


derivatives
 aren't
 magic
 they're
 just


really
 complicated
 math
 in
 a
 fancy
 suit


but
 while
 Hull
 was
 demystifying


derivatives
 our

 the

 by
 George

 is
 what
 happens


when
 a
 billionaire
 Trader
 decides
 to


explain
 his
 success
 using
 philosophy


instead
 of
 charts
 and
 somehow
 it


actually
 makes
 sense
 published
 in
 1987


Soros
 revealed
 his
 theory
 of
 reflexivity


showing
 how
 markets
 aren't
 just
 wrong


they're
 wrong
 in
 ways
 that
 change


reality
 itself
 through
 his
 famous
 theory


of
 reflexivity
 he
 explained
 how
 his


billion
 dooll
 bets
 worked
 though


explaining
 it
 clearly
 was
 apparently
 not


part
 of
 his
 strategy
 the
 book
 showed


that
 market
 prices
 and
 fundamental


reality
 Chase
 each
 other
 like
 a
 dog


chasing
 its
 tail
 creating
 boom
 bust


cycles
 that
 made

 decides
 to

 everything
 we


know
 about
 investment
 returns
 in
 one


book
 and
 actually
 pulls
 it
 off
 published


in
 2011
 after
 Decades
 of
 watching


investors
 Chase

 like
 cats


chasing
 laser
 pointers
 IL
 manin
 created


the
 Grand

 of

returns
 he
 showed
 how
 everything
 from


value
 stocks
 to
 momentum
 trading


actually
 works
 though
 some
 active


managers
 wish
 he
 hadn't
 the
 book


systematically
 destroys
 every
 investing


myth
 while
 building
 a
 framework
 so


comprehensive
 it
 makes
 other
 investment


books
 look
 like
 children's
 stories
 even


phds
 keep
 it
 as
 their
 bedside
 reading


assuming
 they
 can
 lift
 it

 the
 most

thing
 by
 Howard
 marks
 is
 what

when
 one
 of
 the
 world's
 greatest


investors
 spends
 40
 years
 writing
 memos


that
 are
 better
 than
 most
 investment


books
 published
 in
 2011
 marks
 revealed


that
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 in


investing
 is
 realizing
 there
 is
 never


just
 one
 most
 important
 thing
 through


Decades
 of
 Market
 wisdom
 he
 showed
 that


successful
 investing
 is
 about


understanding
 Cycles
 managing
 risk
 and


being
 consistently
 not
 stupid
 which
 is


surprisingly
 harder
 than
 being


occasionally
 brilliant
 his
 insights


about
 Market
 psychology
 and
 contrarian


thinking
 have
 influenced
 everyone
 from


Warren
 Buffett
 to
 hedge
 fund
 managers


though
 most
 still
 can't
 resist
 buying
 it


Market
 Peaks


but
 while
 Marx
 was
 teaching
 us
 about


Market
 Cycles
 our
 next
 author
 was
 about


to
 reveal
 why
 the
 real
 wealth
 isn't
 in


Wall
 Street
 at


all
 number
 28
 the
 mystery
 of
 capital
 by


Hernando
 doto
 is
 what
 happens
 when


someone
 finally
 explains
 why
 copying


Western
 capitalism
 is
 like
 trying
 to


bake
 a
 cake
 without
 turning
 on
 the
 oven


published
 in
 2000
 doto
 revealed
 why


developing
 nations
 remain
 poor
 despite


having
 trillions
 in
 assets
 turns
 out


having
 property
 rights
 is
 kind
 of


important
 through
 extensive
 research
 in


slums
 and
 Shanty
 towns
 he
 showed
 how
 the


world's
 poor
 are
 actually
 sitting
 on


massive
 wealth
 they
 just
 can't
 access
 it


without
 legal
 property
 systems
 the
 book


transformed
 how
 we
 think
 about


development
 economics
 though
 most


policymakers
 were
 too
 busy
 writing


complex
 Aid
 programs
 to
 notice
 but
 while


doodo
 was
 solving
 poverty's
 puzzle
 our


next

 was
 about
 to
 explain

 might
 be

 the
 rise

 of


American
 growth
 by
 Robert
 Gordon
 is
 what


happens
 when
 an
 economist
 decides
 to


tell
 everyone
 the
 part's
 over
 and
 proves


it
 with
 700
 pages
 of
 data
 published
 in


2016
 Gordon
 showed
 that
 the
 Golden
 Age


of
 American
 growth
 wasn't
 just
 special


it
 was


unrepeatable
 through
 fascinating


analysis
 he
 revealed
 how
 Innovations


like
 electricity
 and
 indoor
 plumbing


change
 life
 more
 than
 your
 new
 iPhone


ever
 will
 the
 book
 argued
 that
 modern


Innovations
 are
 more
 about
 entertainment


than
 transformation
 though
 Silicon


Valley
 Executives
 probably
 stopped


reading
 at
 that
 part
 his
 conclusion
 that


slow
 growth
 is
 The
 New
 Normal
 sparked


Global
 debates
 about
 Innovation
 but


while
 Gordon
 was
 explaining
 why
 growth


is
 slowing
 our

 was
 about
 to


show
 us
 why
 Financial

speeding


up

 rogov
 is
 what
 happens
 when


two
 economists
 read
 through
 800
 years
 of


financial
 stupidity
 and
 realize
 we
 keep


stepping
 on
 the
 same
 rake
 published
 in


2009
 they
 showed
 that
 every
 Financial


crisis
 starts
 with
 someone
 saying
 this


time
 is
 different
 spoiler
 alert
 it
 never


is
 through
 centuries
 of
 data
 they


revealed
 how
 countries
 repeatedly


convinced
 themselves
 they
 figured
 out


how
 to
 avoid
 crisis
 right
 before
 walking


into

 the

 proved
 that
 whether


it's

 human


Financial
 Folly

 the
 one
 constant
