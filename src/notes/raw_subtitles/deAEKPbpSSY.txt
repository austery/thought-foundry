When I first joined
the insurance industry,
I realized that telling people about it
was the fastest way
for them to lose interest.
(Laughter)
Fortunately, that's changed.
Risk is so much higher on people's
personal and professional agendas.
We know that it pays to manage risk.
And my industry, our ability to price risk
means that we have tools and products
that can give a signal as to how
we might adapt to climate change.
So when I joined this industry,
I knew nothing about it.
But in my first week,
I learned its role in a modern economy.
Aeroplanes wouldn't fly,
surgeons wouldn't operate,
and Taylor Swift would not go on tour
without access to insurance.
In fact, very few people will take on
a major financial commitment without it.
It works because the losses
of the few are paid for by the many,
making risks manageable.
And so banks rely on insurance.
And if anyone here has built a wind farm
or bought a home,
the banks will have required you
to have insurance in place.
In fact, many, maybe even
most financial transactions
are contingent on insurance
being in place.
And so insurance is the lubricant
of the financial services industry.
And without insurance,
you'll struggle to access debt.
Last bit of the insurance
lesson, I promise.
Premiums price risk.
So the cost of the insurance
gives an indication
of how likely it is
that the insurer thinks
that you will suffer a loss.
And we all know this.
Young, inexperienced drivers
pay high insurance premiums.
Yet on my home,
if I install a burglar alarm
or locks on my windows,
I know the cost will be lower.
So the premium indicates
how likely it is you will suffer a loss,
but there are things that we can do
to reduce the risk and reduce the cost.
So what's any of this
got to do with climate change?
Well, importantly, insurance only works
while extreme weather remains a risk.
If it becomes a near certainty,
insurance becomes unaffordable
and potentially not available.
So we have an industry whose core
competency is pricing risk,
telling us that in places the cost
of risk is too high for people to pay.
And at the same time, we have
a financial services industry
that relies on insurance to provide loans,
which in turn make
the financial system work.
Now the signals are really clear.
We're told that in Australia, by 2100,
1.3 million homes will be uninsurable
due to extreme weather.
And in New South Wales,
that's 90 percent of people's homes.
In New Zealand, it's 10,000 homes
uninsurable by 2050.
And across the world, in Canada,
the Bureau of Insurance says
that nearly 10 percent of homes
are already close to uninsurable
and represent 90 percent
of the industry's losses.
Why?
Extreme weather due to climate change.
Now, since the 1970s,
the cost of extreme weather events
has increased every decade.
Last year, the costs
were 320 billion dollars.
And the LA wildfires on their own,
150 billion dollars.
But it's not just severe losses.
Sticking in the US,
last year, there were 27 incidents
with costs of over one billion dollars.
That's more than two a month.
So the equation has flipped.
It's no longer just the losses of the few.
It's now the losses of the many.
And as a result, we're hearing stories
of people struggling to access insurance.
And if you can't get
insurance for your home,
your house is worth less,
and you'll struggle to sell.
Data in the UK shows
that homeowners with no access
to flood insurance
typically lose 10 to 30 percent
of the home's value.
In Florida, that's 20 to 40 percent.
And 30 percent of mortgage
foreclosures in the US
are expected to be due to extreme weather,
due to climate change, by 2035.
So there's an indication
of people are saying
that insurance has failed, but it has not.
It's just telling us that the costs
are too high to bear.
Simply put, without access to insurance,
people will struggle to secure debt,
they will struggle to sell their homes,
they will struggle to invest
in their businesses.
And we're seeing this happen
due to climate change.
I'm afraid there's another challenge.
Loans and mortgages are normally
taken out for long periods.
It may be 20 years or more.
And so you may build
your wind farm or buy your home,
assuming that you can use insurance
to manage your risk.
Yet over time, the frequency
and severity of extreme weather events
means that insurance becomes unaffordable.
And so you've lost a key tool
in your financial resilience toolkit,
and you're more likely
to default on your loan.
And so we're also in a situation
where the finance industry
are seeing asset devaluations,
they're seeing increased
chances of default,
and so we could have
liquidity crunches in some areas
where investors choose to exit
the areas with the most risk.
So it's clear we need to act.
And the scientists have been telling
us this for a really long time.
It's just the finance industry
is saying it now, too.
Beyond cutting emissions,
which we need to do,
there are things that we can do.
One of the fantastic things
about having a price for risk
is it incentivizes you
to invest in resilience.
And we know that investments
in preventative measures
have a payback of 10
to 13 dollars for every dollar spent.
So as an industry, we need to do far more
to tell people
that prevention saves money.
Now, the cheapest time
to invest in resilience
is when you build new things.
We should only build
resilient new structures.
But 80 to 85 [percent] of the buildings
that exist everywhere in the world today
will still be here in 2040.
So that means we also need to retrofit.
Some of those actions may be things like
lifting electrical equipment
off the ground floor of buildings
to reduce damage from flood,
or you may need to replace
the shingles on your home
with a living roof to make you
more resilient to wildfire.
But these cost money
and some of the interventions
cost a lot of money.
Now there are grants
and there are resilience funds
that can help with this,
but their scale is woefully inadequate.
So as an insurance industry,
we need to do more
to promote preventative measures
so that we're reducing the risk now
and saving for the future.
Now there are lots of roles for insurance
to support climate change.
One other that I want to mention is
I've been talking about the impact
of insurance on property damage,
but there's a type of insurance
called parametric insurance
that supports people in stresses
like extreme heat or water stress.
And right here in Kenya,
we have a program
supporting small-scale farmers.
So in the event that the rains don't come
and the crops fail,
or in India, where extreme heat
means it's unsafe to work in the market,
the micro insurance can replace
people's livelihoods.
And these insurances are impacting
hundreds of thousands
of people's lives globally for the better.
But these insurances too,
will become unavailable and unaffordable
if the risk becomes a certainty.
So insurance is doing exactly
what it's supposed to,
it's pricing risk,
and it's giving us a warning sign
that assets may be worth less
and credit could be less available
as banks either refuse
or charge more for credit
because insurance isn't there.
Which means one of the key tools
in our toolkit may not be available
when we need it most.
So what is my vision for insurance?
I don't want it to be seen as a problem.
I want it to be part of the solution.
Insurance is a sophisticated
financial tool
that provides us all with an incentive
to act as a society.
And that's what we need to do.
We need to invest
in adaptation and resilience
so the risk remains manageable,
enabling people and businesses
to continue to invest in their future.
Thank you.
