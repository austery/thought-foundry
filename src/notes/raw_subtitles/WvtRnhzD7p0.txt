What
 makes
 a
 great
 company?
 That
 is
 the


question
 that
 lies
 at
 the
 heart
 of
 our


investment
 philosophy.
 And
 you've
 just


heard
 from
 one
 of
 our
 talented
 NBIM


portfolio
 managers
 as
 to
 what
 they
 think


corporate
 excellence
 looks
 like.


Today
 we
 have
 the
 incredible
 opportunity


to
 take
 a
 break
 from
 the
 world
 and
 the


market
 events
 and
 explore
 this
 question


in
 depth
 with
 some
 of
 the
 most
 inspiring


minds
 and
 company
 leaders.
 And
 so
 it
 is


with
 great
 pleasure
 that
 we
 welcome
 you


all.
 I
 am
 Shelpi
 Nanda
 and
 I
 am
 Patrick


Duplaci.
 We
 will
 be
 your
 hosts
 for
 today


and
 I
 must
 say
 Shelby
 there's
 a
 lot
 to


look
 forward
 to
 and
 in
 particular
 that


we
 get
 to
 share
 it
 with
 you
 the


audience.
 I
 feel
 the
 exact
 same
 way


Patrick
 and
 so
 we
 would
 like
 to
 extend


an
 extra
 warm
 welcome
 to
 the
 thousands


of
 people
 watching
 us
 via
 the
 live


stream.
 It
 is
 our
 hope
 that
 today's


sessions
 and
 speakers
 will
 spark
 your


imagination,
 inspire
 you
 and
 bring
 you


some
 valuable
 insights
 to
 take
 home.


We
 have
 three
 sessions
 lined
 up
 for
 you.


In
 the
 first
 session,
 we'll
 hear


directly
 from
 some
 of
 the
 best
 companies


present
 with
 us
 here
 today.
 In
 the


second
 session,
 we'll
 shift
 our
 focus
 to


the
 investor
 perspective
 on
 what
 makes


truly
 great
 companies
 stand
 out.
 And
 in


our
 third
 session,
 we'll
 dive
 deeper


into
 the
 very
 important
 role
 leadership


and
 corporate
 culture
 plays
 in
 creating


extraordinary
 companies.


So
 without
 any
 further
 ado,
 let's
 kick


off
 our
 first
 session
 on
 great
 companies


with
 our
 opening
 speaker.
 It
 gives
 me


great
 pleasure
 to
 introduce
 Dean
 Erica


James
 from
 the
 Wharton
 School,
 an


organizational
 psychologist
 by
 training.


Erica
 is
 a
 leading
 expert
 in
 crisis


leadership
 and
 management
 strategy.
 In


addition
 to
 her
 academic
 work
 at


Wharton,
 she
 also
 serves
 on
 the
 boards


of
 Morgan
 Stanley,
 the
 Philadelphia


Orchestra,
 and
 various
 other


institutions
 that
 look
 to
 foster
 the


education
 and
 advancement
 of
 women
 in


business.
 Everybody,
 please
 join
 us
 in


giving
 Erica
 a
 very
 warm
 welcome.


[Music]


Good
 morning
 or
 I
 think
 I
 should
 say


good
 afternoon.
 Uh
 I
 want
 to
 start
 by


saying
 thank
 you
 to
 Nikolai.
 Thank
 you


for
 bringing
 this
 incredible
 group
 of


talented
 leaders
 together
 and
 thank
 you


for
 inviting
 me
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of


it.
 It
 goes
 without
 saying
 that
 we
 are


living
 in
 an
 incredible
 time
 period.
 In


these
 moments
 of
 uncertainty,
 it's
 easy


to
 get
 distracted
 and
 thrown
 off
 course


by
 all
 of
 the
 variables
 that
 we're


surrounded
 by.
 But
 today,
 we
 have
 the


opportunity
 to
 come
 together
 to
 explore


the
 underlying
 dynamics
 about
 what
 makes


a
 company
 great.
 Over
 the
 course
 of
 the


afternoon,
 you
 will
 hear
 how
 industry


leaders
 leverage
 their
 brand,
 their


culture,
 their
 innovation,
 their


operations,
 and
 their
 people
 to
 dominate


their
 respective


fields.
 You'll
 learn
 what
 it
 takes
 to


rise
 to
 the
 top,
 but
 more
 importantly
 to


stay
 there,
 a
 feat
 that
 is
 becoming


increasingly
 difficult
 in
 today's


environment
 of
 uncertainty
 and
 upheaval.


The
 foundational
 elements
 that
 drive
 a


company
 to
 succeed
 or
 fail
 have
 always


fascinated
 me
 and
 fed
 my
 own
 scholarly


pursuits
 analyzing
 how
 organizations
 and


leaders
 respond
 to


crisis.
 As
 a
 researcher,
 I've
 spent


decades
 speaking
 with
 leaders
 about
 how


they've
 navigated
 volatile,
 ambiguous,


and
 unpredictable
 environments.
 And
 what


I
 found
 is
 that
 the
 most
 successful


leaders
 and
 therefore
 the
 most


successful
 companies
 were
 steadfast
 in


the
 face
 of


adversity.
 Meaning
 they
 didn't
 just


hunker
 down
 and
 try
 to
 get
 back
 to


normal.
 They
 really
 wanted
 to
 mobilize


their
 networks,
 their
 knowledge,
 and


their
 resources
 to
 make
 strategic
 and


wise
 adjustments
 amid
 their
 crucible


moment.


Doing
 so
 allowed
 them
 to
 create
 a
 new


normal
 and
 set
 the
 standard
 in


fundamental
 ways.
 In
 the
 end,
 they
 and


their
 companies
 emerged
 stronger
 and
 on


a
 path
 to


growth.
 As
 a
 director,
 I've
 worked
 on


behalf
 of
 organizations
 that
 span
 from


the
 world's
 largest
 and
 most
 influential


financial
 firms
 to
 leading
 cultural


institutions
 and
 firms
 in
 the
 technology


sector.
 And
 through
 those
 experiences,


I've
 observed
 that
 top
 performing


organizations
 embody
 adaptability
 and


strive
 for
 continuous


improvement.
 You
 might
 remember
 the


learning
 organization,
 which
 was
 a


phrase
 and
 a
 concept
 popularized
 by


Peter
 Seni
 in
 the
 late
 1990s.
 It's
 the


notion
 that
 companies
 should
 engage
 in


experimentation
 and
 provide
 structures


to
 actually
 learn
 from
 success
 and


failure.
 And
 it
 that
 concept
 is
 highly


relevant
 to
 the
 moment
 we
 find
 ourselves


in
 today.
 Technological
 advances
 like


artificial
 intelligence
 and
 the
 plethora


of
 political
 shifts
 around
 the
 world
 are


fundamentally
 changing
 the
 way
 companies


and
 societies
 operate.


Companies
 therefore
 have
 to
 adopt
 a


learning
 mindset
 because
 the
 ones
 that


fail
 to
 learn,
 that
 fail
 to
 unlearn,
 or


that
 fail
 to
 relearn
 will
 face
 a


tremendous
 risk
 of


extinction.
 As
 dean
 of
 the
 Wharton


School,
 I'm
 fortunate
 to
 spend
 every
 day


in
 a
 learning
 organization,
 both


figuratively
 and
 literally.
 I'm


fortunate
 to
 be
 surrounded
 by
 incredible


faculty
 who
 are
 vanguards
 of
 their


fields
 and
 whose
 research
 influences
 the


most
 pressing
 problems
 of
 society.
 Human


trafficking,
 climate,
 the
 business
 model


of
 the
 industrial
 prison
 context,
 not


necessarily
 topics
 you
 would
 associate


with
 the
 world's
 leading
 business


school.
 And
 yet,
 the
 Wharton
 faculty
 are


no
 strangers
 to
 what
 makes
 an
 idea,
 a


leader,
 or
 a
 company
 capable
 of
 reaching


the
 highest
 echelons
 of


success.
 And
 by
 serving
 our
 corporate


clients
 through
 executive
 education,


we're
 preparing
 today's
 leaders
 and


challenges
 for
 challenges
 in
 the
 here


and
 now.
 And
 through
 our
 innovative


curricula
 such
 as
 leadership,
 artificial


intelligence,
 and
 finance,
 we
 are


preparing
 future
 leaders
 for
 what
 is


currently


unimaginable.
 So
 my
 life's
 work
 as
 a


researcher,
 a
 leader,
 a
 board
 member
 has


led
 me
 to
 conclude
 that
 there
 are
 many,


many
 paths
 to
 corporate
 success.
 And
 I


have
 no
 doubt
 that
 today's
 discussions


will
 uncover
 even
 more
 perspectives,


present
 new
 business
 perspectives
 and


unlock
 a
 world
 of


possibilities.
 So
 I
 encourage
 you,
 I


invite
 you
 all
 to
 soak
 up
 this
 time


together,
 take
 in
 all
 of
 the
 knowledge,


all
 of
 the
 insights
 on
 display
 with
 the


leaders
 you
 will
 be
 introduced
 to
 today


because
 the
 future
 belongs
 to
 those
 who


are
 committed
 to
 learning
 faster
 than


the
 pace
 of
 change.
 Thank
 you.


[Applause]


valuable


insights.
 Our
 next
 leader
 leads
 one
 of


the
 world's
 most
 influential
 financial


institutions.
 David
 Solomon
 is
 the


chairman
 and
 the
 CEO
 of
 the
 Goldman


Sachs
 Group.


David's
 journey
 began
 in
 Goldman
 Sachs


in
 1999
 as
 a


partner.
 Over
 the
 years,
 he's
 taken
 on


increasingly
 important
 roles
 from


co-head
 of
 investment
 banking
 to


president
 before
 stepping
 into
 the
 CEO


position.
 Under
 his
 leadership,
 Goldman


Sachs
 has
 continued
 to
 evolve
 while


maintaining
 its
 position
 at
 the


forefront
 of
 global
 finance.
 Please
 join


me
 in
 welcoming
 David
 Solomon.


[Applause]


[Music]


Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Good
 afternoon


everybody.
 I'm
 delighted
 to
 be
 here.


Nikolai,
 thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.
 I
 I


enjoyed
 the
 evening
 last
 night
 and
 and


delighted
 to
 be
 in
 Oslo
 today.
 I've
 been


asked
 to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 culture


at
 Goldman
 Sachs
 and
 on
 this
 theme
 of


durability
 of
 an
 enterprise.


Goldman
 Sachs
 has
 been
 around
 for
 156


years
 and
 I
 am
 incredibly
 proud
 to


steward
 that


organization,
 but
 it
 is
 certainly
 clear


to
 to
 me
 and
 to
 the
 leadership
 of


Goldman
 Sachs
 broadly
 that
 it's
 very


unusual
 for
 a
 company
 to
 survive
 for
 156


years.
 There
 aren't
 a
 lot
 of


them.
 The
 culture
 of
 Goldman
 Sachs
 has


evolved
 over
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time.
 And


as
 I
 think
 about
 how
 to
 articulate
 some


aspects
 of
 it
 that
 might
 help
 you


understand
 how
 we
 think
 about
 it
 at
 the


firm,
 I'm
 reminded
 of
 a
 story
 that


highlighted
 for
 me
 at
 a
 different
 stage


in
 my
 career
 how
 important
 culture
 was


in
 the
 durability
 of
 an


organization.
 I
 was
 promoted
 to
 run


investment
 banking
 in
 2006.


Before
 that
 time,
 I
 did
 not
 spend
 a
 lot


of
 time
 talking
 to
 outside
 investors.


But
 when
 I
 was
 promoted,
 I
 started
 to
 go


see
 investors
 to
 talk
 about
 that


business,
 which
 is
 a
 very
 important


business
 for
 the


firm.
 I
 was
 in
 Boston
 meeting
 with
 a
 big


shareholder
 of
 the
 firm,
 and
 he
 was


drilling
 me
 on
 a
 number
 of
 different


areas
 of
 how
 we
 were
 running
 the


business.
 And
 I
 was
 listening
 very


carefully
 as
 I
 heard,"Well,
 why
 aren't


you
 doing
 this
 and
 you
 should
 be
 doing


this
 and
 why
 aren't
 you
 doing
 that?"
 And


after
 about
 45
 minutes,
 I
 said
 to
 him,


"I
 appreciate
 all
 the
 questions.
 Why
 do


you
 own
 the
 stock?
 Why
 do
 you
 own


Goldman
 Sachs?"
 And
 he
 looked
 at
 me
 and


he
 said,
 "That's
 simple.
 I
 believe
 you


have
 one
 of
 the
 most
 strong,
 enduring,


differentiated
 cultures."
 And
 when
 you


look
 at
 my
 five
 core
 holdings
 in
 my


portfolio,
 they're
 all
 companies
 where
 I


believe
 that
 to
 be
 true
 because
 a
 strong


enduring
 culture
 leads
 to
 better


relative
 performance
 over
 time.
 And
 I


never
 forgot
 that.
 And
 I
 went
 back
 and
 I


thought
 a
 lot
 about
 some
 of
 the
 things


that
 differentiate
 Goldman
 Sachs.
 So
 in


the
 few
 minutes
 I
 have
 today,
 I
 wanted


to
 point
 to
 a
 couple
 of
 things
 that
 I


think
 our
 organization
 has
 gotten
 right


over
 the
 years
 that
 have
 made
 a


difference
 for
 us.


First,
 we
 went
 public
 after
 133
 years
 in


19
 99,
 26
 years
 ago.
 The
 leaders
 at
 the


time
 did
 something
 that
 was
 different.


They
 didn't
 just
 go
 public.
 They
 went


public,
 but
 said,
 "We're
 going
 to
 retain


a
 partnership


structure."
 At
 the
 time,
 everybody
 said,


"Well,
 you
 can't
 do
 that
 anymore.
 You're


no
 longer
 a
 partnership.
 You're
 a
 public


company."
 But
 the
 leaders
 at
 the
 time


said,
 "We're
 going
 to
 value
 this


partnership
 because
 the
 partnership


allows
 us
 to
 live
 to
 and
 collaboratively


support
 the
 values
 of
 the
 firm."
 What


are
 the
 four
 principal
 values
 that


Goldman
 Sachs
 strives
 to
 live
 to
 every


day?
 Client
 service,
 partnership,


integrity,
 and
 excellence.
 And
 there
 was


a
 view
 that
 if
 we
 took
 in
 our


population,
 at
 the
 time
 that
 we
 went


public,
 it
 was
 13,000
 people.
 in
 that


13,000
 people
 and
 we
 identified
 the
 top


one
 one
 and
 a
 half%
 as
 true
 leaders
 to


carry
 the
 firm
 forward.
 If
 we
 could


retain
 that,
 the
 firm
 could
 be
 a


differentiated
 and
 more
 powerful


organization.
 So
 over
 the
 last
 26
 years,


we've
 retained
 a
 partnership.
 It's
 not
 a


pure
 economic
 partnership
 like
 a


traditional
 partnership
 in
 a
 law
 firm
 or


what
 Goldman
 Sachs
 was
 before.
 But
 every


two
 years
 we
 elect
 new
 partners
 and


those
 partners
 which
 are
 approximately


1%
 of
 the
 firm
 lead
 this
 organization


forward.
 We
 take
 it
 very
 seriously.


There's
 a
 collaborative
 nature.
 It's


about
 subjugating
 your
 own
 interest
 for


the
 interest
 of
 the
 whole
 and
 we
 work


hard
 to
 protect
 it
 and
 invest
 in
 it.


What's
 an
 obvious
 way
 to
 see
 the


investment
 that
 goes
 into
 it
 is
 to
 look


at
 the
 process
 we
 use
 to
 select
 those


partners
 every
 two


years.
 There
 would
 be
 lots
 of
 ways
 that


you
 could
 do
 this,
 but
 we've
 developed
 a


process
 that
 really
 goes
 back
 to
 when
 it


was
 a
 true
 partnership.
 We've
 developed


a,
 for
 a
 lack
 of
 a
 better
 term,
 unique


process
 of
 what
 we
 call
 crossruffing.


What
 is
 cross
 roughing?
 We
 organize
 a


group
 of
 partners
 to
 go
 out
 and
 talk
 to


all
 the
 existing
 partners
 of
 who
 they


want
 to
 bring
 up
 into
 the
 partnership.


And
 so
 last
 fall,
 as
 we
 do
 every
 two


years,
 a
 group
 of
 40
 partners
 went
 out


and
 interviewed
 360
 existing
 partners


and
 did
 over
 a,020
 to
 30
 minute


interviews
 to
 basically
 look
 at


approximately
 160
 candidates
 to


ultimately
 choose
 95
 to
 enter
 this


partnership.
 And
 despite
 the
 fact
 that


we're
 a
 public
 company,
 the
 aspirational


nature
 of
 participating
 in
 this


partnership
 remains
 incredibly
 high
 and


the
 effort
 that
 goes
 into
 these


selections
 is
 incredibly
 rigorous.


That's
 an
 investment
 and
 a


representation
 of
 how
 important
 we
 as
 a


firm
 take
 this
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 why
 this
 is
 perpetuated
 for


26
 years
 as
 a
 public
 company.
 I
 can't


think
 of
 another
 public
 firm
 that
 has


something
 that
 looks
 quite
 like
 this,


but
 it
 works
 for
 us
 and
 we're
 going
 to


continue
 to
 invest
 in
 it
 because
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 the
 460
 partners
 that
 we


now
 have
 of
 Goldman
 Sachs
 wake
 every
 day


feeling
 like
 they
 have
 a
 leadership


ownership
 interest
 in
 doing
 the
 right


thing
 to
 drive
 the
 firm
 forward.


Now,
 when
 you
 talk
 about
 culture
 and
 how


culture
 sustains
 itself,
 one
 of
 the


things
 I've
 learned
 over
 time
 is
 you
 can


never
 take
 it
 for
 granted
 and
 you
 have


to
 constantly
 invest
 and


reinvest.
 The
 pandemic
 was
 a
 very


difficult
 time
 for
 all
 of
 us.
 It
 was
 a


particularly
 difficult
 time
 for


professional
 services
 businesses
 and


Goldman
 Sachs
 is
 a
 professional
 services


business.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 our


business
 thrives
 on
 people
 being


together.
 Our
 business
 thrives
 on


apprenticeship.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 that's


unique
 about
 Goldman
 Sachs,
 we
 have


47,000
 employees.
 50%
 of
 them
 are
 in


their
 20s.
 The
 culture
 and
 the
 ecosystem


of
 the
 firm
 is
 that
 young
 people
 come
 to


the
 firm
 to
 learn,
 to
 be
 mentored,
 to
 be


groomed.
 A
 small
 slice
 of
 them
 stay
 and


develop
 their
 careers.
 The
 rest
 of
 them


go
 out
 in
 the
 world
 to
 do
 other
 things.


That
 is
 our
 model.
 Pandemic
 very
 tough


on
 that.
 And
 just
 culturally
 our
 firm
 is


one
 of
 constant
 open
 transparent


dialogue,
 collaboration,
 getting


different
 views.
 You
 know,
 of
 course
 on


video
 you
 can
 do
 some
 of
 that,
 but
 it's


not
 the
 same.
 As
 we
 were
 coming
 out
 of


the
 pandemic,
 we
 felt
 that
 the
 culture


of
 the
 firm
 had
 lost
 a
 step.
 And
 so
 a


group
 of
 us
 as
 leaders
 sat
 down
 and


said,
 "How
 can
 we
 reinvest?
 How
 can
 we


reinvigorate?
 How
 can
 we
 take
 an
 action


that
 will
 send
 a
 message
 that
 we're


deeply
 committed
 at
 a
 time
 like
 this
 to


strengthening
 our
 culture?
 So,
 we
 came


up
 with
 a
 program
 that
 we
 called
 the


cultural
 stewards
 program.
 And
 we


decided
 that
 we
 were
 going
 to
 take
 all


the
 partners
 of
 the
 firm.
 We
 were
 going


to
 put
 them
 in
 cohorts
 of
 25
 people.
 And


over
 the
 course
 of
 a
 15-month
 period
 of


time,
 we
 were
 going
 to
 force
 every


cohort
 to
 go
 offsite
 for
 two
 days
 to


talk
 about
 the
 importance
 of
 the


culture,
 their
 responsibility
 in


stewarding
 it,
 and
 what
 were
 the
 actions


that
 they
 could
 take
 to
 reinvigorate
 it


and
 continue
 it.
 And
 so
 over
 a
 15-month


period
 of
 time,
 we
 set
 out
 the
 partners


to
 do
 that.
 And
 I
 made
 a
 commitment
 to


go
 have
 dinner,
 a
 two
 to
 three
 hour


dinner
 with
 every
 single
 one
 of
 those


cohorts
 all
 over
 the
 world.
 And
 I
 did


that
 not
 so
 I
 could
 communicate
 my


strong
 passion
 for
 our
 culture,
 but


rather
 I
 could
 listen
 to
 every
 single


one
 of
 them
 communicate
 to
 me
 as
 the


leader
 of
 the
 firm
 why
 they
 thought
 it


was
 important
 and
 what
 they
 thought


needed
 to
 be
 done
 to
 continue
 to


strengthen
 it
 going
 forward.
 It
 was
 a


difficult
 15
 months
 from
 a
 travel


perspective,
 but
 it
 was
 one
 of
 the
 most


enriching
 things
 I
 personally
 have
 done


during
 my
 seven
 years
 as
 CEO.
 The


learnings
 I
 took
 away,
 but
 the


reinvigoration,
 the
 re-energizing
 of
 our


culture
 permeated
 through
 the


organization
 and
 this
 army
 of
 400


partners
 that
 went
 through
 this
 program


loved
 it.
 and
 they
 went
 out
 as
 an
 army


into
 the
 firm
 to
 the
 other
 45,000


employees
 and
 basically
 took
 on
 their


responsibility
 to
 talk
 about
 and
 support


that
 culture
 and
 invest
 in
 it.
 And
 so
 it


was
 a
 great
 example
 of
 taking
 a


conscious
 effort
 to
 say
 this
 is


important.
 We're
 going
 to
 take
 time
 and


we're
 going
 to
 arm
 our
 leaders
 to
 go
 out


and
 push
 that
 down
 into
 the


organization.
 And
 it
 worked
 incredibly


incredibly
 effectively
 for
 us
 for
 our


organization.
 Another
 important
 part
 of


our
 culture
 that
 we
 have
 to
 live
 with


and
 think
 about
 and
 worry
 about
 every


day
 is
 risk
 management.
 We
 are
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day
 a
 financial
 institution


and
 we
 do
 have
 a
 1.7
 to$
 1.8
 trillion


balance
 sheet
 and
 we
 are
 a
 risk-taking


business.
 We
 take
 risk,
 we
 respond
 to


risk,
 we
 have
 to
 manage
 risk.


There
 are
 all
 different
 ways
 that


organizations
 try
 to
 deal
 with
 the
 risk


that
 they
 take
 on.
 But
 for
 us,
 the


collaboration,


transparency,
 and
 kind
 of
 intellectual


rigor
 around
 which
 we
 try
 to
 develop
 a


culture
 of
 risk
 management
 in
 every


daily
 interaction
 has
 been
 paramount
 to


trying
 to
 make
 better
 decisions
 rather


than
 bad
 ones
 time
 and
 time
 again.
 Now,


of
 course,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 risk
 business,


you're
 going
 to
 make
 mistakes.
 You're


going
 to
 make
 bad
 decisions.
 The


question
 is,
 when
 you
 make
 a
 mistake,


how
 do
 you
 respond
 to
 it?
 How
 do
 you


create
 a
 culture
 where
 people
 run
 to


problems
 instead
 of
 looking
 to
 point


others
 towards
 problems?
 How
 do
 you


create
 a
 culture
 where
 everybody


believes
 that
 if
 they
 see
 something


that's
 not
 right,
 they
 believe
 it's


their
 inherent
 responsibility
 to
 elevate


it,
 shed
 more
 transparency
 on
 it,
 and


make
 people
 more
 aware
 of
 it.


You
 do
 that
 by
 every
 day
 thinking
 about


those
 things,
 talking
 about
 those


things,
 incentivizing
 those
 things,
 and


rewarding
 those
 things.
 And
 our
 culture


of
 risk
 management
 has
 been
 deeply,


deeply
 important
 to
 our
 firm's
 success


over
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time.
 One
 of
 the


things
 that
 all
 of
 us
 at
 Goldman
 Sachs


are
 humbled
 by
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 we've


been
 around
 for
 156
 years.
 I
 keep
 in
 my


office
 a
 copy
 of
 the
 perspectus
 for
 the


Ford
 IPO
 which
 was
 in
 the
 1950s.
 One
 of


the
 reasons
 I
 keep
 it
 and
 I
 look
 at
 it


periodically
 is
 because
 if
 you
 look
 at


that
 perspectus,
 okay,
 there
 are
 very


few
 companies
 on
 that
 perspectus
 that


still
 exist
 today.
 The
 financial


services
 industry
 is
 filled
 with


companies
 that
 come
 and
 go.
 In
 fact,


even
 more
 recent
 to
 that
 point,
 if
 you


go
 look
 at
 the
 Goldman
 Sachs
 perspectus,


when
 Goldman
 Sachs
 went
 public
 26
 years


ago,
 there
 were
 13
 companies
 on
 the


cover,
 I
 believe
 only
 four
 of
 them
 still


exist
 today,
 one
 being
 Goldman
 Sachs.


So,
 it's
 a
 very
 dynamic
 industry
 and
 at


any
 point
 in
 time,
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 the


right
 culture
 of
 risk
 management,
 your


viability
 is
 threatened.
 And
 so,
 that's


why
 we
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 focusing
 on


that.


The
 last
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 touch
 on
 from
 a


cultural
 perspective
 is
 this


foundational
 value
 of
 client


service.
 We
 are
 a
 client
 business.
 Our


business
 rises
 and
 falls
 with
 the


experience
 our
 clients
 have
 when
 they


interact
 with
 the
 firm.
 If
 we
 don't
 wake


up
 every
 day
 trying
 to
 really
 think


about
 how
 we
 can
 enhance
 the
 experience


our
 clients
 have
 with
 us,
 we
 will
 not


strengthen
 and
 grow
 our
 business.


One
 of
 the
 things
 we're
 incredibly
 proud


of
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 great
 lesson
 in


trying
 to


simplify
 messages
 to
 get
 a
 result
 to


incentivize
 a
 result
 is
 a
 program
 that


we
 launched
 on
 October
 1st,


2018,
 my
 first
 day
 as
 CEO
 that
 is
 called


one
 Goldman
 Sachs.


This
 was
 an
 experiment
 that
 in
 the


months
 leading
 up
 to
 this
 leadership


team
 starting
 in
 October


2018,
 we
 said
 that
 we
 wanted
 to
 find
 a


way
 to
 really
 improve
 the
 client


experience
 our
 clients
 were
 having
 at


the


firm.
 And
 we
 said
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


was
 happening
 was
 our
 clients
 were


getting
 bigger
 and
 more
 complex
 and
 they


were
 touching
 the
 firm
 in
 lots
 of


different


ways.
 So
 we
 said
 let's
 do
 an
 experiment.


Let's
 take
 the
 30
 largest,
 most


important
 clients
 of
 the
 firm
 and
 let's


put
 them
 in
 a
 pilot
 and
 let's
 call
 that


pilot
 one
 Goldman
 Sachs
 and
 let's


announce
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 incentivize


the
 organiza
 incentivize
 the


organization
 to
 improve
 the
 experience


of
 those
 30
 clients
 and
 let's
 see
 what


happens.
 Well,
 the
 funny
 thing
 about
 one


Goldman
 Sachs
 is
 you
 don't
 really
 need


to
 put
 a
 paragraph
 underneath
 it
 for


everybody
 to
 know
 what
 it
 means.
 It's
 a


very
 simple
 statement.
 one
 Goldman
 Sachs


and
 everybody
 had
 their
 own


interpretation
 of
 what
 that
 meant
 and


how
 to
 execute
 on
 it.
 But
 the
 result
 was


extraordinary.
 The
 organization
 kind
 of


got
 behind
 it.
 Everybody
 wanted
 to


participate
 and
 so
 now
 one
 Goldman
 Sachs


has
 become
 a
 cultural
 operating
 ethos.


The
 program
 for
 clients
 that
 started


with
 30
 now
 has
 130
 clients
 that
 are
 a


part
 of
 the
 program.
 But
 the
 whole
 firm


inside
 and
 out
 operationally
 with
 all


clients
 whether
 they're
 in
 that
 program


technically
 or
 not
 thinks
 about


delivering
 a
 one
 Goldman
 Sachs


coordinate
 experience
 that
 always
 starts


with
 how
 does
 the
 client
 experience
 us


and
 how
 can
 we
 make
 it
 better.
 It's
 been


hugely
 successful
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 a


great
 example
 of
 if
 you
 want
 cultural


change,
 create
 a
 message
 that
 everyone


can
 repeat
 over
 and
 over
 again,
 that


everybody
 can
 grab
 on
 to
 and
 where


people
 can
 understand
 clear,
 definable


results.


So
 what
 I've
 tried
 to
 do
 in
 10
 minutes


is
 give
 you
 a
 couple
 examples
 of
 how


passionate
 we
 are
 in
 using
 the
 culture


of
 the
 firm,
 these
 four
 fundamental


values
 to
 protect
 and
 enhance
 our


business.
 I
 think
 it's
 hugely
 important.


I
 think
 without
 that
 focus,
 our
 business


would
 not
 be
 as
 strong
 as
 a
 business
 it


is
 as
 it
 is.
 But
 we
 do
 not
 take
 it
 for


granted
 and
 we
 wake
 up
 every
 day
 knowing


that
 we
 have
 to
 continue
 to
 do
 that
 if


we
 want
 to
 sustain
 Goldman
 Sachs
 for


generations
 ahead.
 Thank
 you
 all
 very


much
 and
 have
 a
 great


day.
 Thank
 you
 David.
 That
 was
 extremely


interesting.
 Our
 next
 speaker
 leads
 one


of
 the
 world's
 most
 innovative


healthcare
 companies.
 L
 Furugard


Yurgensen
 is
 president
 and
 CEO
 of
 Nova


Nordisk
 where
 he's
 worked
 for
 over
 30


years
 of
 his
 career.
 Under
 his
 guidance,


Nova
 Nordisk
 has
 transformed
 health
 care


for
 millions
 of
 people
 living
 with


diabetes
 and
 obesity.
 Their
 breakthrough


treatments
 are
 not
 only
 changing
 lives,


they
 are
 redefining
 what
 we
 believe
 is


possible
 in
 these
 critical
 areas
 of


healthcare.
 The
 stage
 is
 yours,


[Applause]


L.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 that
 kind


introduction
 and
 also
 uh
 thank
 you
 for


the
 opportunity
 to
 be
 here
 today.
 Uh


it's
 a
 great
 honor.
 Um
 we're
 talking


about
 what
 makes
 great
 companies.


Obviously
 you
 would
 all
 feel
 that
 return


to
 shareholders
 is
 one.
 Uh
 I
 would
 claim


contribution
 to
 society
 is
 another.
 And


for
 a
 company
 like
 Noah
 Nordisk
 and
 all


farm
 tool
 companies
 that
 is
 linked
 to


innovation
 and
 that's
 what
 will
 be
 the


topic
 of
 uh
 of
 my
 speech
 today.
 We


typically
 look
 at
 companies
 uh
 at
 a


snapshot
 and
 assess
 a
 company.
 But
 when


it
 comes
 to
 innovation
 in
 our
 sector,


these
 are
 actually
 journeys
 that
 takes


10,
 20,
 30
 years.
 And
 as
 was
 mentioned,


my
 speech
 will
 be
 built
 on
 the
 more
 than


30
 years
 of
 experience
 uh
 I
 have
 from


Noisk.


I'll
 start
 by
 talking
 a
 bit
 to
 uh
 what


are
 some
 of
 the
 choice
 you
 can
 make
 when


it
 comes
 to
 uh
 innovation
 strategy
 uh


because
 strategy
 is
 about
 making
 choice


and
 you
 cannot
 be
 everything
 for


everybody.
 So
 you
 need
 to
 make
 some


choice
 to
 build
 uh
 deep
 uh
 strength
 and


then
 I'll
 give
 a
 few
 examples
 of
 how
 we


have
 applied
 that
 in
 some
 real
 uh


innovation
 uh
 programs.
 So
 starting


first
 on
 the
 innovation
 strategy
 uh
 for


me
 that's
 linked
 to
 having
 a
 clear


purpose
 an
 opportunity
 to
 to
 address


some
 real
 unmet
 need
 in


society
 and
 then
 you
 have
 to
 figure
 out


how
 do
 you
 address
 that
 purpose
 and
 uh


at
 noon
 noise
 we
 are
 very
 keen
 on
 making


some
 selective
 choice
 about
 some
 core


capabilities
 where
 we
 still
 where
 we


develop
 distinct
 capabilities
 with
 the


eye
 to
 be
 the
 best
 or
 among
 the
 say
 few


best
 companies
 in
 the
 world
 within
 that


narrow


area.
 So
 if
 you
 unfold
 purpose
 first
 the


purpose
 of
 noises
 is
 to
 drive
 change
 to


defeat
 serious
 chronic
 diseases.
 So


there's
 a
 chronic
 disease
 part
 and


there's
 a
 drive
 change


part.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 healthare
 systems


today
 they
 are
 typically
 designed
 for


acute
 care.
 I
 typically
 say
 that
 the


best
 way
 to
 enter
 the
 healthcare
 system


is
 to
 arrive
 in
 an
 ambulance
 with
 know
 a


lot
 of
 lights
 around
 you
 because
 then


the
 whole
 system
 gets
 in
 effect
 in
 a


very
 effective
 way
 right


away.
 So
 that's
 how
 we
 designed


healthcare.
 The
 reality
 today
 is
 that


most
 burdens
 uh
 to
 the
 healthare
 system


come
 from
 chronic
 diseases,
 people


living
 with
 diabetes,
 cardiovascular


disease,
 obesity
 etc.
 And
 these
 are


complex
 diseases


multidisciplinary
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 they


are
 treated
 and
 the
 systems
 are
 not


designed
 for
 that.
 So
 in
 most
 countries


the
 the
 state
 of
 chronic
 disease
 is


actually
 jeopardizing
 the
 longevity
 of


healthare
 systems
 and
 that
 is
 the
 exact


purpose
 that
 we're
 trying
 to
 address
 uh


to
 take
 the
 burden
 of
 the
 healthcare


system
 and
 of
 course
 strength
 the
 health


resilient
 for
 the
 individual
 citizens.


The
 driving
 change
 uh
 we
 also
 take
 very


seriously.
 Obviously
 our
 largest


contribution
 is
 the
 innovation
 we
 make


but
 we're
 also
 focused
 on
 preventing
 the


diseases
 we
 serve.
 So
 how
 can
 we


organize
 large
 cities
 in
 a
 way
 where
 we


prevent
 type
 2
 diabetes,
 we
 prevent


obesity
 uh
 to
 create
 capacity
 in
 the


healthare
 system
 to
 actually
 pay
 for
 the


products
 we
 come
 up
 with.
 And
 if
 the


system
 is
 challenged
 in
 doing
 that
 today


uh
 prevention
 is
 as
 important
 as
 coming


up
 with


innovation.
 So
 that
 was
 our
 purpose


turning
 to
 uh
 core
 capabilities.
 Uh
 we


have
 a
 painful
 experience
 in
 innovation


that
 has
 taught
 us
 that
 when
 we
 actually


uh
 make
 the
 clear
 choice,
 stay
 within


our
 core
 capabilities,
 we
 are
 more


likely
 to
 succeed
 than
 when
 we
 are


tempted
 by
 the
 latest
 and
 the
 greatest


innovation
 and
 chase
 some
 new
 technology


in
 a
 disease
 area
 we
 do
 not
 understand


that
 well.
 So
 over
 the
 years
 we
 have


focused
 a
 lot
 on
 working
 with
 the


molecules
 in
 the
 areas
 we
 are
 in
 and


building
 leading
 technologies
 to
 do


that.
 So
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 to
 protein


engineering
 taking
 an
 insulin
 molecule


taking
 a
 GP1
 molecule
 or
 another
 large


biological
 molecule
 being
 able
 to
 modify


that
 to
 improve
 the
 pharmaceutical


benefits
 of
 that
 we
 are
 among
 the


leading
 companies
 uh
 in
 doing
 that.


So
 we
 have
 a
 very
 simple
 strategic


innovation
 grid
 where
 on
 one
 axis
 we


have
 technologies.
 So
 a
 select
 few


technologies
 we
 master
 really
 really


well
 and
 then
 we
 apply
 those
 up
 against


a
 few
 set
 of


diseases,
 diabetes,
 uh
 you
 know
 a
 100


year
 commitment
 and
 then
 we
 have
 based


on
 adjacency
 thinking
 gone
 into
 obesity,


cardiovascular
 disease
 and
 a
 few
 other


diseases
 that
 are
 linked
 to
 that
 whole


cardium
 metabolic
 space
 and
 you
 can
 say


the
 same
 in
 uh
 a
 few
 rare
 diseases
 where


we
 also
 had
 unique


capabilities.
 So
 a
 very
 tight
 strategic


innovation
 map
 where
 we
 can
 build


strength
 and
 it
 actually
 also
 leads
 to


synergies
 across
 our
 value
 chain
 where


those
 capabilities
 lend
 itself
 for
 uh


synergy
 across
 that
 value
 chain.
 Now


that
 sounds
 maybe
 a
 bit
 tight
 and
 based


on
 Davy's
 comment
 I'll
 also
 bring
 in


culture
 uh
 because
 we
 do
 allow
 for
 a
 bit


of
 say
 experimentation
 and
 I
 have
 to


admit
 that
 while
 this
 grid
 is
 really


good
 at
 guiding
 our
 researchers


uh
 behind
 most
 products
 there's
 actually


a
 very
 stubborn
 researcher
 that
 divi


that
 decided
 to
 break
 some
 of
 the
 rules


on
 the
 way
 uh
 to
 uh
 a
 bit
 go
 against


what
 management
 thought
 was
 the
 right
 uh


thing
 to
 do.
 And
 if
 you
 think
 about
 uh


our
 whole
 JL
 per
 one
 venture
 which
 I'll


talk
 a
 bit
 about
 in
 a
 in
 a
 minute
 that


came
 after
 seven
 years
 of
 success
 in


insulin.
 So
 you
 can
 imagine
 when


somebody
 suggested
 let's
 focus
 on


something
 else
 most
 of
 management
 felt


maybe
 that
 was
 not
 a
 a
 good
 idea.
 I


would
 say
 however
 that
 it
 was
 driving


against
 the
 same
 purpose
 the
 same
 unmet


need
 and
 it
 was
 leveraging
 the
 same
 set


of
 core
 capabilities.
 So
 it
 was
 actually


on
 strategy
 I
 have
 to


say.
 So
 leaving
 uh
 a
 bit
 innovation


strategy
 and
 then
 going
 through
 some
 of


the
 examples.
 Uh
 I
 already
 started
 on


GLP1
 glucagon
 like
 peptide
 one.
 This
 is


the
 molecule
 behind
 uh
 say
 the
 strong


growth
 of
 no
 noise
 right
 now.
 Uh
 it's
 a


natural
 hormone
 that
 all
 of
 us
 have
 in


our
 body
 right
 now.
 It
 helps
 regulate


your
 glucose
 level
 after
 lunch.
 It
 also


has
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 additional
 benefits


which
 creates
 it
 creates
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 opportunities
 in
 terms
 of


addressing
 many
 of
 these
 cardabolic


diseases.
 The
 natural
 gap
 one
 you
 have


in
 your
 body
 if
 you
 extracted
 that
 and


want
 to
 use
 that
 a
 medicine
 it
 doesn't


work
 because
 it
 only
 lasts
 for
 very
 very


short
 time.
 So
 our
 bodies
 are
 designed


to
 produce
 it
 all
 the
 time.
 Uh
 so
 from
 a


research
 point
 of
 view
 it
 doesn't
 work


as
 a
 medicine
 because
 if
 you
 take
 it
 uh


somehow
 uh
 it
 would
 last
 only
 for
 a
 few


seconds.
 So
 that's
 where
 our
 core


capabilities
 came
 in.
 So
 the
 protein


engineering
 modifying
 first
 to
 make
 it


last
 for
 one
 day
 so
 you
 can
 make
 it
 a


daily
 injection
 and
 then
 continue
 the


innovation
 game
 to
 make
 it
 a
 once


weekly.
 So
 a
 weekly
 injection
 with
 even


improved
 pharmaceutical
 benefits
 and
 uh


also
 safety
 benefits
 and
 also
 the
 quest


to
 make
 it
 a
 tablet
 which
 was
 from
 a


textbook
 point
 of
 view
 impossible.
 So
 if


you
 ask
 any
 scientist
 if
 you
 take
 a


protein
 formulated
 into
 a
 tablet
 put
 it


in
 the
 stomach
 will
 that
 be
 absorbed


into
 the
 bloodstream?
 People
 say
 no


because
 the
 enzymes
 in
 your
 stomach
 that


just
 broke
 down
 the
 steak
 you
 had
 will


also
 kill
 this
 tablet
 because
 it's
 a


protein
 and
 enzymes
 will
 kill
 it.
 So
 uh


an
 example
 of
 how
 our
 core
 capabilities


come
 into
 play
 is
 what
 you
 then
 do
 with


that.
 How
 can
 you
 actually
 make
 a
 unique


formulation
 uh
 together
 with
 a


partnership
 with
 a
 biotech
 company
 that


creates
 a
 local
 pH
 environment
 that


actually
 uh
 you
 know
 fenders
 off
 the


enzymes
 so
 there's
 time
 for
 the
 GLP1
 to


be
 released
 go
 through
 the
 membrane
 and


into
 the
 bloodstream.
 So
 that
 was
 a


major
 revolution
 and
 that
 is
 now
 in
 the


market
 for
 type
 two
 diabetes
 and
 we
 have


submitted
 it
 for
 approval
 in
 obesity
 in


the
 US.


So
 the
 J1
 journey
 started
 in
 in


diabetes.
 We
 saw
 that
 you
 also
 lose


weight.
 Uh
 we
 were
 worried
 about


actually
 pursuing
 the
 obesity
 indication


because
 back
 then
 uh
 development
 of


medicines
 for
 obesity
 was
 a
 graveyard
 of


failed
 interventions.
 Some
 of
 the


products
 even
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 dangerous


and
 were
 taken
 off
 the
 market.
 So
 we
 had


this
 fantastic
 hope
 in
 type
 two
 diabetes


but
 we
 saw
 that
 patients
 also
 lose
 lost


weight.
 So
 we
 felt
 we
 actually
 had
 to


study
 that
 and
 was
 actually
 a
 bit
 say
 a


decision
 made
 uh
 uh
 from
 a
 say
 a
 respect


for
 patients
 because
 if
 if
 there
 was
 a


weight
 loss
 observed
 we
 knew
 that
 it


would
 be
 used
 for
 weight
 loss.
 So
 we
 had


to
 study
 it
 to
 show
 what
 was
 actually


the
 safety
 of
 that.
 So
 it
 was
 actually
 a


risk
 taken
 to
 support
 patient
 safety
 and


then
 uh
 I
 think
 as
 we
 all
 know
 it
 turns


into
 a
 fantastic
 commercial
 opportunity


because
 it
 actually
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 a


very
 very
 attractive
 weight
 loss
 agent


and
 we
 have
 uh
 down
 the
 road
 also
 shown


that
 it
 reduces
 risk
 of
 cardascular


disease,
 kidney
 disease,
 uh
 liver


disease
 and
 later
 this
 year
 we'll
 have


data
 on
 potential
 use
 in
 Alzheimer's


disease.


So
 the
 quest
 to
 continue
 invasion
 in
 J1


continues.
 We
 have
 more
 great
 ideas
 and


we
 also
 now
 combining
 it
 with
 other


biologies
 bi
 biology
 we
 believe
 lot
 is


is
 is
 amalain.
 So
 we
 believe
 it's


complimentary
 to
 GLP1
 and
 uh
 we
 have


late
 stage
 clinical
 trials
 going
 on


there.
 So
 the
 journey


continues.
 Another
 example
 of
 how
 the


core
 capabilities
 and
 the
 purpose
 comes


into
 play
 is
 weekly
 insulin.
 So
 no
 noise


is
 a
 100
 year
 history
 of
 making
 insulins


as
 we
 all
 know
 and
 uh
 when
 you
 live
 with


type
 one
 diabetes
 or
 type
 two
 diabetes


you
 need
 to
 inject
 insulins
 uh
 on
 a


regular
 basis
 because
 you
 no
 longer


produce
 insulin
 or
 you
 no
 longer
 produce


enough


insulin
 and
 that
 takes
 place
 once
 a
 day


or
 several
 times
 a
 day
 and
 obviously


it's
 a
 big
 burden
 for
 for
 the
 patients


because
 you
 have
 to
 combine
 that
 with


constant
 glucose
 monitoring.
 So
 would
 it


be
 possible
 to
 make
 a
 weekly
 insulin


that
 would
 take
 the
 burden
 away
 from


these
 daily
 treatments?
 And
 again,
 most


of
 the
 key
 opinion
 leaders,
 the


clinicians
 we
 work
 with
 say
 that's


impossible
 because
 who
 would
 like
 to


inject
 insulin
 that
 stays
 for
 a
 week


because
 that's
 dangerous.
 Uh
 you
 can
 get


too
 low
 glucose
 level,
 it
 can
 kill
 you.


Um
 so
 we
 said,
 well,
 let's
 again
 work
 a


bit
 with
 this
 insulin
 molecule.
 How
 can


we
 leverage
 our
 protein
 engineering


capabilities?
 And
 we
 actually
 made
 it.


Uh
 we're
 now
 launching
 the
 first
 the


world's
 first
 weekly
 insulin
 where


people
 with
 type
 two
 diabetes
 goes
 from


365
 injections
 to
 52.
 We
 proved
 that
 it


regulates
 glucose
 level
 as
 well
 as
 daily


injections
 and
 even
 at
 a
 very
 attractive


safety
 profile.


So
 there
 are
 many
 of
 these
 uh


impossibles
 that
 when
 you
 have
 a
 strong


purpose
 in
 terms
 of
 serving
 a
 defined


set
 of
 of
 patients
 where
 the
 unmet
 needs


and
 you
 have
 the
 deepest
 capability
 in


the
 world
 in
 a
 narrow
 field
 you
 can


overcome
 uh
 conventional
 uh
 barriers.


The
 next
 quest
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 insulin


is
 actually
 developing
 a
 glucose


sensitive
 insulin.


Um,
 when
 you
 live
 with
 diabetes,


wouldn't
 it
 be
 fantastic
 to
 get
 a


insulin
 injected
 that's
 actually
 glucose


sensitive?
 So,
 when
 you
 eat,
 it
 will


switch
 on,
 bring
 the
 glucose
 level
 down,


and
 when
 it's
 brought
 down,
 it
 switches


off.
 So,
 a
 smart


insulin.
 Uh,
 I
 have
 parents
 writing
 to


me,
 uh,
 I
 have
 a
 particular
 parent
 who


already
 lost
 one
 child
 because
 of
 a


very,
 very
 difficult
 to
 control
 type
 1


diabetes.
 and
 he's
 really
 really


interested
 in
 our
 clinical
 development


of
 this
 because
 he
 has
 another
 child


with
 type
 1
 diabetes.
 So
 any
 buffering


effect
 can
 be
 very
 very
 important
 for


these
 patients.
 We
 are
 proven
 that
 we


can
 make
 the
 switch
 work.
 So
 it
 start


releasing
 insulin
 and
 it
 stops
 releasing


insulin
 uh
 when
 the
 glucose
 level
 is


high.
 It's
 still
 too
 shortlived
 to
 be
 a


drug.
 But
 going
 back
 to
 the
 first


example
 I
 gave
 with
 GP1,
 we
 we
 solve


that
 down
 the
 road.
 So
 uh
 I
 start


blossoming
 when
 I
 talk
 about
 it
 because


this
 is
 very
 emotional
 for
 these
 uh


patients.
 So
 I
 hope
 I
 made
 the
 point


that
 uh
 innovation
 is
 uh
 essential
 for


our
 industry.
 Uh
 I
 took
 over
 7
 and
 a


half
 years
 ago
 and
 during
 this
 tenure


I've
 seen
 the
 advent
 of
 obesity
 market


opening
 up
 uh
 being
 the
 only
 company


more
 or
 less
 uh
 our
 share
 price
 eight


doubling
 and
 then
 coming
 a
 bit
 down.


It's
 still
 a
 three
 times
 up
 since
 I


since
 I
 took
 over.
 So
 clearly
 there's


link
 between
 innovation
 and
 shareholder


return.
 I
 hope
 I
 also
 made
 the
 point


that
 by
 having
 guidance
 by
 clear
 purpose


addressing
 unmet
 need
 for
 patient
 and


society
 and
 also
 having
 a
 deep
 focus
 on


a
 set
 of
 core
 capabilities
 where
 you're


distinct
 uh
 compared
 to
 others
 uh
 you


have
 a
 a
 better
 likelihood
 of
 success


than
 others.
 And
 uh
 by
 saying
 true
 to


that
 I'm
 quite
 uh
 convinced
 that
 no
 one


noise
 will
 be
 a
 successful
 uh
 company
 uh


for
 the
 future
 also
 and
 hopefully
 be
 uh


one
 of
 the
 best
 companies
 for
 the


future.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much
 for


listening.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much


Lash.
 Our
 next
 speaker
 leads
 a
 company


that
 moves
 over
 2.4
 billion
 people
 each


day.
 Well,
 not
 literally,
 of
 course,
 but


as
 the
 chair,
 CEO,
 and
 president
 of


Utis,
 Judy
 Marx
 oversees
 one
 of
 the


world's
 premier
 manufacturers
 of


elevators
 and


escalators.
 In
 a
 world
 that
 craves


connection,
 Utus
 has
 been
 connecting


people
 and
 places
 for
 over
 170


years.
 Since
 joining
 in
 2017,
 Judy
 has


successfully
 led
 the
 company
 through
 its


spin-off
 in
 2020
 while
 continuing
 to


build
 on
 its
 legacy
 of


innovation.
 Please
 join
 me
 in
 welcoming


Judy
 Marks
 to
 the
 stage.


[Applause]


Good
 afternoon
 and
 and
 thank
 you


Nikolai.
 It's
 a
 privilege
 to
 be
 here.


You
 heard
 David
 speak
 about
 culture.
 You


heard
 Lars
 speak
 about
 innovation.
 They


are
 certainly
 foundational
 at
 Otis.
 But


what
 I
 want
 to
 share
 with
 you
 today
 is
 a


little
 bit
 about
 operational
 excellence


and


discipline.
 To
 do
 that,
 let
 me
 provide


some
 context
 on
 who
 we
 are.
 Uh,
 as


Shipra
 said,
 in
 September,
 we'll


celebrate
 our
 172nd
 anniversary
 of
 a


company,
 a
 company
 whose
 founder,
 Elijah


Otis,
 invented
 the
 safety
 break
 that


allowed
 all
 of
 us
 to
 feel
 safe
 riding
 up


and
 down.
 It
 allowed
 cities
 not
 just
 to


emerge,
 but
 to
 grow
 and
 thrive.
 And
 here


I
 am
 today
 to
 share
 with
 you
 how
 we
 do


that
 as
 the
 industry
 leader
 for
 the
 past


almost
 172
 years.
 Building
 on
 a
 spirit


of
 innovation,
 but
 most
 importantly


building
 on
 operational


discipline,
 very
 much
 discipline
 every


day
 in
 200
 countries
 and
 territories


around
 the
 world.
 How
 do
 we
 do
 that?
 We


do
 that
 through
 a
 team
 of
 72,000


colleagues,
 of
 which
 44,000
 are
 field


professionals.
 Field
 professionals
 who


are
 out
 installing,
 but
 most
 importantly


servicing
 our
 product
 and
 keeping
 the


world
 moving.
 2.4
 billion
 people
 we


touch
 every
 day.
 And
 I
 can't
 control
 or


train
 any
 one
 of
 them.
 We
 have
 to
 have
 a


quality
 product,
 a
 safe
 product
 because


we
 are
 in
 the
 life
 safety
 business.
 You


trust
 us
 every
 time
 you
 use
 our
 product


in
 an
 autonomous
 manner
 every
 day


without
 thinking.
 A
 ubiquitous
 product


and
 a
 ubiquitous
 service
 that
 we
 don't


care
 what
 the
 building
 purpose
 is.
 It


may
 be
 your
 residence.
 It
 may
 be
 a


hospital.
 It
 may
 be
 a
 school.
 It
 may
 be


an
 office
 building.
 But
 for
 us,
 it's
 all


about
 completing
 that
 journey
 for
 you


safely.


Every
 day
 somewhere
 in
 the
 world
 we
 are


doing
 10,000
 equipment


installations.
 And
 every
 day
 somewhere


in
 the
 world
 we
 are
 doing
 200,000


service
 calls.
 Little
 higher
 yesterday


with
 Spain
 and


Portugal.
 Crisis
 management.
 Crisis


management.
 Um,
 but
 think
 about
 what


that


takes
 in
 your
 homes,
 in
 your


businesses,
 in
 your
 travel,
 in


infrastructure
 to
 be
 able
 to
 repeatably


provide
 that
 with
 a
 workforce
 of
 44,000


field
 professionals
 who
 work


independently,
 who
 represent
 us
 by


wearing
 our
 our
 brand,
 our
 iconic
 brand


right
 over
 their
 heart
 on
 their


uniforms,
 and
 who
 do
 this
 universally


through
 the
 same
 processes
 and
 through


the
 application
 of
 technology
 a
 little


different
 than
 Elijah
 Otis
 used
 where
 we


continuously
 innovate
 and
 disrupt


ourselves
 but
 not
 our
 processes
 not
 our


mission
 and
 that's
 what's
 important
 to


us.
 So
 how
 do
 we
 do


this?
 We
 do
 this
 through
 uh
 a
 very


focused
 business
 model.
 You'll
 rep


you'll
 recognize
 a
 flywheel.
 There's


probably
 no
 other
 industry
 or
 certainly


no
 other
 business
 that
 lives
 this


religiously
 every
 day.
 We
 show
 up
 every


morning
 focused.
 We
 show
 up
 and
 that's


everywhere
 in
 the
 world
 except


sanctioned
 countries.
 We
 show
 up
 focus


to
 make
 sure
 the
 world
 moves.
 To
 do


that,
 it's
 all
 about
 our
 service
 engine.


We
 sell
 new
 equipment
 to
 be
 able
 to


secure
 the
 service
 for
 15
 or
 20
 years.


We
 then
 modernize
 that
 equipment
 because


while
 an
 elevator
 will
 move
 up
 and
 down


and
 an
 escalator
 will
 move
 diagonally


and
 a
 moving
 walkway
 will
 go
 this
 way,


they
 never
 leave
 the
 building.
 So
 we


have
 to
 come
 back
 and
 do
 technology


infusions.
 We
 have
 to
 come
 back
 and


replace
 elevators
 in
 live
 buildings


beyond
 the
 10,000
 construction
 projects


we're
 doing
 every
 day.
 And
 we
 have
 to
 do


that
 through
 proven
 processes,
 through


independent
 workforces
 who
 represent
 us


and
 who
 have
 to
 understand
 our
 purpose.


So
 we
 do
 innovate,
 absolutely
 innovate


in
 products
 and
 in
 services,
 but
 we
 sell


that
 new
 equipment.
 We
 install
 it
 in


buildings
 throughout
 the


world.
 And
 then
 we
 have
 the
 ability


again
 to
 maintain
 it
 on
 a
 scheduled


maintenance.
 We're
 in
 a
 regulated


industry.
 to
 service
 it
 and
 repair
 it


when
 it
 breaks,
 a
 break
 fix
 business,


which
 we
 also
 do,
 and
 then
 as
 the
 cycle


goes
 to
 modernize
 it
 and
 keep
 it
 in
 our


portfolio.
 There
 are
 22
 million


elevators
 and
 escalators
 in
 use
 in
 this


world.
 We
 service
 2.4
 million
 of
 those.


We
 are
 the
 largest
 service
 provider


anywhere.
 Of
 those
 2.4
 4
 million
 when
 we


spun
 in
 April
 of
 2020
 in
 the
 midst
 of


the
 pandemic.
 And
 being
 an
 essential


service,
 we
 were
 just
 under
 two
 million


units.
 We
 are
 growing
 at
 about
 a
 100,000


units
 every
 year,
 which
 had
 been


stagnant
 when
 we
 were
 part
 of
 our
 former


parent.
 We
 were
 part
 of
 a
 large


conglomerate
 where
 operational


excellence
 was
 important,
 but
 it
 wasn't


the
 critical
 motivator.
 where
 our


colleagues
 were
 humbly
 proud,
 but
 they


didn't
 understand
 that
 it's
 all
 about


the
 service
 flywheel
 that
 allows
 us
 to


maintain
 that
 customer
 centricity,
 that


customer
 excellence,
 and
 that
 ability
 to


prove
 ourselves
 each
 and
 every
 day
 with


each
 and
 every
 service


call.
 You
 don't
 think
 about
 our
 product,


and
 we're
 happy
 you
 don't
 think
 about
 it


typically
 until
 there's
 an
 issue.
 And


then
 whether
 you're
 entrapped
 or
 you


don't
 have
 use,
 you
 think
 about
 us.
 So


now
 the
 application
 of
 technology
 and


being
 more
 customer
 centric
 is
 about


applying
 IoT.
 We've
 got
 a
 million
 of
 our


2.4
 million
 units
 connected.
 Huge
 data


lake,
 incredible
 AI
 that
 today
 allows
 us


to
 do
 preventive
 maintenance.
 So
 we're


when
 we're
 doing
 schedule
 maintenance,


we
 can
 repair
 something
 before
 it
 breaks


and
 impacts
 you
 as
 a
 customer
 or
 the


riding
 public.


And
 that
 will
 lead
 to
 prognostics
 as


well.
 We
 have
 incredible
 traffic


algorithms
 that
 use
 predictive
 AI,
 but


we
 will
 balance
 AI
 with
 the
 ethics
 of
 AI


because
 your
 life
 safety
 is
 involved.
 We


will
 use
 it
 in
 every
 part
 of
 our


business
 because
 it
 is
 revolutionary.


But
 we
 will
 also
 balance
 making
 sure
 we


don't
 have
 one
 of
 our
 field


professionals
 on
 the
 top
 of
 a
 car


maintaining
 it
 and
 making
 sure
 you're


not
 in
 it
 when
 we're
 doing
 it.
 So
 that's


the
 balance
 that
 we
 hold.
 This
 flywheel


has
 provided
 really
 incredible
 results


to
 date
 because
 everyone's
 focused
 on


it.
 We're
 a
 service
 company.
 Of
 course,


we're
 an
 industrial.
 We
 have
 17


manufacturing
 plants.
 We
 manufacture


local
 for
 local.
 That's
 just
 that's
 just


table
 stakes
 as
 an
 industrial.
 But
 a


service
 company
 and
 as
 culture,
 we
 focus


on
 our
 we
 call
 them
 absolutes.
 We
 don't


call
 them
 values.
 We
 call
 them
 absolutes


because
 if
 you
 don't
 follow
 them,
 you


won't
 be
 part
 of
 our
 company.
 First
 is


safety.
 We
 work
 at
 heights.
 We
 work
 in


buildings.
 As
 you
 can
 imagine,
 in


construction,
 as
 well
 as
 in
 service,


everyone
 goes
 home
 safe
 every
 night.


Zero
 is
 the
 only
 acceptable
 answer
 for


fatalities
 or
 serious


incidents.
 We
 focus
 on
 ethics
 because


that
 is
 what
 has
 made
 our
 company
 a


quality
 lasting
 company.
 And
 we
 focus
 on


quality
 because
 you
 depend
 on
 us
 for


reliability
 and
 for
 safety.
 So,
 as
 we
 do


all
 this,
 the
 flywheel
 works
 its
 magic.


And
 in
 our
 business
 today,
 a
 little
 over


60%
 of
 our
 revenue
 comes
 from
 service,


as
 you
 would
 imagine,
 but
 over
 90%
 of


our


profits.
 You
 can
 think
 of
 a
 razor
 razor


blade
 where
 we
 make
 money
 on
 the
 razor


as
 well.
 So,
 our
 new
 equipment
 business


is
 profitable,
 but
 nowhere
 near
 the


profit
 of
 our
 service
 business.
 And
 you


may
 ask,
 is
 this


sustainable
 after
 172
 years?
 Have
 you


innovated
 enough?
 How
 have
 you
 disrupted


enough?
 Does
 your
 operational
 cadence


get
 you
 to
 tomorrow
 to
 2030
 to


2050?
 I'm
 here
 to
 say
 yes
 because
 we


consistently
 reinvent
 ourselves.
 We


consistently
 apply
 technology
 so
 that


our
 mechanics
 will
 have
 the
 best


technologies.
 It's
 not
 a
 a
 grease
 and


lube
 and
 and
 a
 mechanical
 structure


anymore.
 It's
 about
 the
 passenger


experience.
 It's
 about
 being
 customer


centric
 and
 again
 having
 preventive


information
 to
 help
 you
 as
 you
 go.
 What


we've
 seen
 is
 is
 really
 that
 incredible


focus
 and
 discipline
 gives
 us
 our


retention
 rate
 which
 is
 in
 the
 92
 to
 93%


level
 for
 customers.
 They
 stay
 with
 us


day
 after
 day,
 year
 after
 year
 and
 they


have
 that
 choice
 in
 our
 contract


structure.
 And
 then
 when
 we
 hit
 about
 15


or
 20
 years,
 the
 flywheel
 starts
 all


over
 again
 because
 then
 we
 refurbish
 and


modernize
 the
 equipment
 in
 a
 live


building.
 And
 so
 many
 other
 companies


have
 to
 go
 adjacent.
 Everyone
 has
 to


innovate.
 We
 don't
 need
 to
 do
 that.
 We


have
 enough
 organic
 growth
 in
 front
 of


us.
 Of
 the
 22
 million
 elevators
 in
 this


world,
 over
 8
 million
 are
 over
 20
 years


old
 and
 in
 need
 of
 refreshment,
 in
 need


of
 potentially
 full
 full
 replacement.


that
 market
 will
 be
 larger
 than
 these


10,000
 construction
 jobs
 we're
 doing


every
 day
 uh
 before
 the
 end
 of
 the


decade.
 So
 we
 have
 organic
 growth
 in


front
 of
 us
 in
 our
 service
 business


which
 is
 maintenance
 and
 repair
 and
 this


modernization
 and
 refurbishment
 business


will
 be
 an
 evergreen
 opportunity
 because


by
 the
 time
 we
 finish
 this
 cycle
 it'll


be
 time
 for
 another
 cycle
 to
 be
 able
 to


keep
 buildings
 in
 the
 asbuilt
 world


moving.
 the
 results
 since
 since
 we


became
 independent
 since
 we
 became


focused
 uh
 when
 I
 joined
 Otis
 in
 late


2017
 to
 to
 turn
 the
 business
 to
 be


prepare
 for
 this
 even
 though
 the
 board


decision
 hadn't
 been
 made
 it
 was
 being


discussed
 we
 had
 a
 few
 activists
 in
 the


stock
 we
 were
 in
 our
 seventh
 year
 of
 no


earnings
 growth
 as
 part
 of
 a


conglomerate
 would
 never
 have
 survived


as
 an
 independent
 company
 2018
 was
 our


eighth
 year
 by
 2019
 19.
 We
 turned
 the


business.
 We've
 got
 all
 of
 our


colleagues
 focused.
 We're
 up


significantly
 in
 terms
 of
 topline,
 but


we're
 steady.
 We're
 we're
 not
 the
 we're


not
 the
 three
 times
 growth
 and
 and
 we're


steady.
 Operational
 excellence
 provides


for
 steady
 results.
 Our
 uh
 our
 margins


are
 up
 220
 basis
 points
 in
 the
 five


years
 since
 we've
 spun.


We
 have
 had
 service
 operating
 profit


growth
 in
 all
 21
 quarters
 and
 we
 have


had
 operating
 profit
 growth
 all
 five


years.
 And
 you
 can
 see
 the
 results
 when


you
 have


discipline
 a
 simple
 but
 elegant
 business


model
 I
 like
 to
 call
 it
 which
 everyone


in
 the
 company
 understands
 and
 they


understand
 our
 purpose.
 So
 our
 mission


very
 simply
 is
 to
 be
 a
 world-class


customer-
 centric
 serviceoriented


business.
 Our
 vision
 is
 we
 give
 people


freedom
 to
 connect
 and
 thrive
 in
 a


taller
 faster
 smarter
 world.
 The
 world


is
 getting
 faster.
 It's
 certainly


getting
 smarter
 with
 AI.
 It's
 certainly


getting
 taller
 with
 urbanization
 as
 it


continues.
 And
 we
 are
 well
 positioned
 as


a
 foundational
 company,
 as
 a


foundational
 disciplined
 industrial


company,
 a
 service
 company
 to
 continue


to
 provide
 the
 returns.
 Over
 this
 same


period,
 we
 have
 taken
 everyone,
 every


dollar
 primarily
 that
 we
 have
 generated


and
 returned
 $6
 billion
 of
 cash
 to
 our


shareholders
 either
 through
 dividends
 or


share


repurchases.
 I'm
 proud
 of
 our
 purpose.


I'm
 proud
 of
 who
 we
 are
 and
 I'm
 proud


that
 we
 touch
 every
 one
 of
 you
 every
 day


of
 your
 life
 and
 keep
 the
 world
 moving.


Thank
 you
 very
 much.


Thank
 you,
 Judy,
 for
 some
 very


interesting


insights.
 The
 next
 company
 we're
 going


to
 hear
 from
 is
 Ferrari.
 Perhaps
 the


most
 iconic
 brand
 in
 cars,
 renowned
 for


its
 engineering
 excellence,
 its
 design,


and
 not
 least,
 its
 racing
 heritage.
 Our


next
 speaker
 became
 CEO
 in
 2021
 after
 a


successful
 career
 working
 in
 micro


electronics
 and
 sensor
 technology.
 As
 a


guest
 on
 the
 podcast
 in
 Good
 Company,
 he


told
 Nikolai
 Tongan,
 "Ferrari
 is
 not
 a


car,
 it
 is
 a
 dream."
 Please
 join
 me
 in


welcoming
 Mr.
 Benedetto
 Vigna,
 the
 CEO


of
 Ferrari,
 and
 Nikolai
 Tongan,
 our
 CEO


at


[Applause]


NBIM.
 Well,
 I
 have
 to
 say
 this
 is
 just


so
 much


fun.
 So,
 I
 heard
 um
 I
 heard
 that
 uh
 the


founder
 of
 Ferrari,
 Enzo
 Ferrari,
 once


uh
 was
 stuck
 in
 a
 lift
 and
 and
 and
 lost


a
 race.
 Not
 obvious.
 Not
 obvious.
 Not


obvious.
 He
 lost
 the
 race
 and
 never
 took


a
 lift
 again.
 That's
 true.
 You
 studied


very
 well
 yesterday.
 Yeah,
 it's
 true.


Absolutely.
 It
 was
 in
 Piscara.


So
 um
 uh
 Benedto,
 you
 say
 that
 uh


Ferrari
 is
 not
 a
 car,
 it's
 a
 dream.
 And


um
 in
 1
 hour
 and
 35
 minutes,
 you
 will


bring
 out
 a
 new
 dream.
 Yeah.
 Because
 you


have
 a
 car
 launch
 today.
 Two
 dreams
 with


two
 car,
 two
 special
 version
 of
 a
 car


coming
 out
 today.
 Yeah.
 So
 good
 timing


with
 this
 seminar.
 Yeah,
 very
 good.
 Uh


you
 should
 have
 been
 waiting
 and
 we


couldn't
 show
 you.
 But
 we
 can't
 show
 any


pictures
 because
 it's
 like
 1
 hour
 and
 35


minutes
 early.
 But
 what
 can
 you
 tell
 us


about
 these
 two
 new
 cars?
 Look,
 we
 have


innovation
 is
 very
 key.
 I
 was
 listening


to the
 presentation
 of
 David
 and
 Judy.


Innovation
 is
 key
 and
 uh
 this
 year
 is


very
 important
 for
 us
 because
 we
 will


have
 six
 new
 model
 that
 will
 propose
 to


the
 world
 and
 the
 first
 two
 will
 be


announced
 in
 a
 few
 minutes.


So
 if
 you
 had
 to
 if
 you
 had
 to
 say


something
 about
 them
 four
 wheels
 one


steering


wheel
 some
 aluminum
 some
 glass.
 No
 you


you
 you
 have
 to
 wait
 because
 we
 had
 a


meeting
 with
 our
 with
 journalist


everything
 is
 under
 embargo.
 So
 if
 I
 I


say
 something
 you
 know
 but
 I
 can
 tell


you
 that
 is
 special
 version
 of
 hybrid


car


and
 it
 will


be
 I
 drove
 it
 several
 times
 it's
 very


funny
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 client
 one
 of
 them


was
 texting
 me
 now
 can
 I
 see
 something


can
 I
 see
 something
 I
 said
 you
 have
 to


wait
 also
 Nikolai
 is
 asking
 something


you
 have
 to
 wait
 a
 little
 bit
 I
 cannot


make
 a
 friends.


Okay.
 Uh
 what
 uh
 just
 coming
 back
 to
 uh


to
 Patrick's
 comment.
 I
 mean
 what
 is


Ferrari
 in
 in
 your
 mind?
 What
 what
 is


it?
 Ferrari
 I
 mean
 we
 have
 been
 working


in
 the
 last
 years
 since
 I
 I
 came
 over


there
 because
 Ferrari
 was
 missing
 if
 you


want
 a
 formal
 brand
 bible.
 So
 we


clarified
 the
 the
 purpose
 of
 Ferrari
 and


this
 was
 done
 listening
 to
 all
 the


people
 in
 the
 company
 and
 we
 the
 purpose


of
 our
 company
 is
 very
 simple
 is
 the


following.
 We


audaciously
 redefine
 the
 limit
 of


possible.
 I
 as
 you
 said
 I
 mean
 I
 was


working
 in
 a
 in
 a
 different
 world
 in
 a


different
 space
 for
 25
 years
 in
 a
 space


we
 were
 we
 were
 making
 I
 was
 working
 for


a
 company
 making
 chips
 and
 that
 world
 is


moving
 at
 very
 high
 pace
 very
 high
 pace


when
 you
 go
 in
 a
 company
 such
 as
 Ferrari


that
 is
 a
 luxury
 company
 you
 see


something
 that
 is
 really
 unique
 is
 the


human
 dimension
 the
 human
 dimension
 the


passion
 the
 sense
 of
 belonging
 that
 you


see
 in
 people
 in
 Ferrari
 but
 also
 all


the
 stakeholders
 and
 the
 people
 around


Ferrari
 is
 very
 unique.
 So
 I
 like
 to
 say


that
 Ferrari
 is
 the


glue
 around
 the
 people
 putting
 them
 for


the
 people
 pushing
 them
 toward


redefinition
 of
 of
 what
 is
 possible
 that


that's
 but
 I
 mean
 in
 your
 previous
 job


where
 you
 do
 microchips
 you
 reinvent
 uh


yourself
 every
 18
 24
 months
 or
 whatever


new
 new
 models
 and
 so
 on.
 Now,
 with


Ferrari,
 what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the


things
 that
 you
 do
 reinvent
 and
 what
 are


the
 things
 that
 need
 to
 be
 the
 same?
 I


mean,
 you
 got
 some
 you
 got
 some
 iconic


things,
 right?
 The
 yellow
 clock
 in
 the


middle,
 all
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 Yeah,


which
 of
 course
 I
 don't
 know
 so
 much


about,
 but
 you
 know
 much
 more
 a
 little


bit.
 No,
 look,
 I
 I
 can
 tell
 you


something.
 I
 share
 with
 the
 team
 after


the
 capital
 market
 day.
 It
 was
 16th
 June


22
 when
 we
 had
 capital
 market
 day.
 The


day
 after
 we
 did
 deployment
 in
 all
 the


company
 and
 I
 was
 with
 the
 the
 leader


the
 management
 of
 the
 company
 and
 I
 said


look
 you
 believe
 you
 are
 fast
 I
 told


them
 I
 told
 them
 you
 are
 not


fast
 silence
 a
 lot
 of
 said
 you
 are
 fast


yes
 if
 you
 compare
 yourself
 with


automotive
 companies
 you
 are
 fast
 but
 if


you
 compare
 with
 high-tech
 companies
 you


are
 not
 fast
 and
 then
 I
 told
 them
 three


things
 one
 the
 speed
 of
 automotive


companies
 is
 one
 the
 speed
 of
 Ferrari
 is


10
 the
 speed
 of
 high-tech
 is


100.
 Do
 we
 need
 as
 a
 company
 to
 go
 to


100?
 No.
 Because
 high-tech
 companies


don't
 care
 about
 the
 past.
 The
 past
 in


high-tech
 company
 is
 a


burden.
 In
 a
 luxury
 company,
 the
 past
 is


a
 fundamental
 ingredient.
 So
 where
 we


are
 aiming
 to
 be
 as
 a
 company
 for
 me
 the


indicator
 is
 30
 35
 where
 we
 are
 in
 terms


of
 speed
 after
 three
 years
 and
 a
 half
 I


would
 say
 around
 18
 20.
 So
 what
 does
 it


mean?
 There
 are
 opportunities
 for
 us
 to


improve
 on
 the
 operational
 efficiency.


There
 are
 opportunities
 for
 us
 to


improve
 on
 on
 innovation.
 The
 company
 is


doing
 relatively
 well.
 But
 I
 always
 push


the
 team
 to
 stay
 really
 with
 the
 four


wheels
 on
 the
 ground.
 Nowadays
 more
 than


ever
 it's
 important
 to
 be
 prudent
 to


understand
 what
 are
 the
 areas
 where
 you


can
 improve.
 So
 it
 tech
 company
 have
 a


different


mindset,
 different
 culture.
 The
 company


I
 don't
 know
 maybe
 some
 of
 you
 have
 been


working
 over
 there.
 It
 is
 a
 speed
 for


the
 sake
 of
 speed
 because
 otherwise
 you


don't
 you
 lose
 the
 you
 know
 you
 lose
 the


grip
 in
 a
 in
 in
 a
 luxury
 company
 does


not
 make
 sense.
 So
 you
 would
 destroy


yourself.
 So
 where
 in
 the
 company
 where


in
 the
 company
 do
 you
 need
 speed?
 I


think
 that
 there
 are
 a
 speed
 on
 speed
 we


need
 to
 achieve
 by
 deleting
 something


that
 is
 not
 bringing
 value
 to
 client


that
 is
 important.
 I
 think
 there
 are


different
 areas.
 It
 goes
 in
 in


production.
 It
 goes
 on
 the
 on
 the
 the


marketing.
 It
 goes
 in
 the
 communication.


I
 mean
 there
 are
 different
 areas.
 I


think
 no
 company
 is
 perfect.
 Nobody
 will


no
 company
 will
 be
 ever
 perfect.
 It's


always
 an
 improving
 process.
 I
 think


that
 we
 have
 to
 to
 be
 conscious
 of
 this


and
 we
 have
 to
 work
 on
 that.
 Have
 a
 you


know
 humility
 I
 would
 say.
 Absolutely.


How
 have
 you
 changed
 the
 global
 culture


since
 you
 came
 in?
 What
 are
 the
 things


you've
 changed?
 But
 what
 I
 understand
 I


changed
 if
 I
 listen
 to
 what
 people
 tell


me
 is
 that
 I
 am
 and
 this
 is
 not
 a
 critic


at
 all
 for
 all
 the
 people
 before
 me


because
 each
 leadership
 style
 is
 good
 I


think
 for
 each
 historical
 moment.
 I


think
 that
 uh
 the
 attention
 of
 of
 the


company
 to
 employee
 has
 been
 always


there.
 I
 have
 to
 say
 that
 one
 of
 the


reason
 why
 also
 I
 selected
 to
 join


Ferrari
 is
 because
 attention
 of
 the


company
 to
 the
 grow
 and
 development
 of


employee.
 I
 remember
 when
 I
 had
 the


discussion
 with
 the
 board
 member
 and
 I


saw
 the
 program
 and
 investment
 on
 the


growth
 employee
 that
 that
 was
 for
 me
 an


important
 decide
 I
 mean
 factor.
 There
 is


also
 another
 point
 is
 the
 uh
 how
 would


you
 say
 there's
 mutual
 respect
 is
 there


I
 think
 two
 things
 I
 brought
 one
 is
 more


open
 communication


I
 don't
 I
 I
 spend
 I
 would
 say
 1%
 of
 my


time
 in
 my
 office
 I
 am
 always
 with


people
 and
 I
 I
 talk
 with
 all
 the
 people


across
 different
 organizational
 level
 I


mean
 you
 actually
 like
 people
 right
 I


yeah
 I
 like
 people
 because
 I
 think


that's
 the
 easiest
 and
 the
 best
 way
 to


learn
 you
 can
 read
 books.
 But
 the
 point


is
 that
 uh
 takes
 more
 time
 and
 then


how
 many
 how
 many
 how
 many
 people
 do
 you


speak
 how
 many
 people
 you
 speak
 to


because
 I
 generally
 because
 I
 generally


speak
 generally
 speak
 I
 don't
 think
 we


speak
 with
 enough
 people.
 I
 agree
 with


you.
 But
 look,
 I
 I
 I
 had
 the
 luck
 to


have
 I
 was
 working
 for
 this
 company
 I


was
 telling
 you
 before
 and
 the
 CEO
 that


now
 is
 89
 years
 old
 before
 stepping
 in


the
 role,
 I
 call
 it
 many
 friends,
 young


CEO
 and
 old
 CEO,
 old
 in
 the
 role
 I
 mean


and
 I
 got
 some
 advices
 and
 this
 CEO,
 the


previous
 CEO
 of
 the
 company
 I
 was


working
 for,
 three
 CEO
 before
 he
 told
 me


talk
 to
 the
 people
 onetoone.
 So
 when
 I


get
 in
 the
 company
 I
 asked
 my
 assistant


to


arrange


300
 interview
 one
 to
 one
 to
 be
 to
 do
 in


uh
 let's
 say
 90
 days
 and
 that's
 what
 I


did.
 I
 mean
 all
 levels
 of
 all
 levels
 I


think
 why
 why
 is
 that
 important?
 Because


you
 need
 to
 see
 the
 reality
 from


different
 angle.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 have
 a


clear
 picture
 of
 the
 reality
 you
 need
 to


see
 from
 different
 angles.
 I
 mean
 if
 you


see
 an
 object
 like
 this
 is
 the
 same
 from


your
 point
 of
 view
 but
 the
 company
 is


not
 so
 symmetric.
 It's
 very
 asymmetric.


So
 you
 needed
 to
 have
 a
 different
 point


of
 view
 from
 different
 people
 and
 for
 me


it
 was
 very
 easy.
 I
 mean
 without
 their


input


without
 really
 their
 insight
 I
 don't


think
 I
 would
 have
 been
 able
 to
 to
 lead


the
 company
 with
 the
 team
 in
 this
 way.


How
 would
 you
 if
 you
 were
 to
 describe


your
 management
 style?
 What
 would
 you


say?


I
 would
 say
 that
 I
 have


a
 very
 direct
 I
 am
 maybe
 scientific
 in


the
 sense
 that
 uh
 I
 go
 in
 a
 meeting
 and


I
 like
 to
 hear
 what
 the
 people
 tell
 me.


If
 I
 have
 my
 point
 of
 view
 and
 they


demonstrate
 my
 point
 of
 view
 is
 wrong,
 I


I
 don't
 have
 any
 problem
 to
 change


it.
 I
 would
 say
 that
 this
 is
 the
 feature


that
 the
 people
 uh
 at
 least
 do
 to
 what


they
 tell
 me
 they
 like.
 They
 don't
 you


know
 I
 would
 say
 more
 really
 scientific


I
 do
 not
 enter
 meeting
 with
 my
 point
 of


view
 that
 is
 already
 nailed
 down
 carved


out
 I
 mean
 I
 would
 like
 to
 I
 like


to
 to
 dance
 with
 the
 people
 allow
 me
 to


say
 so
 I
 have
 my
 point
 of
 view
 your


point
 of
 view
 let's
 discuss
 let's
 see


which
 are
 the
 fact
 you're
 a
 good
 dancer


my
 wife
 is
 telling
 me
 I'm
 not
 good
 okay


um


How
 do
 you
 get
 your
 ideas
 across
 in
 the


organization?
 How
 do
 I
 get
 ideas?


Because
 you
 can
 sit
 at
 the
 top
 and
 you


can
 have
 great
 ideas,
 right?
 But
 I
 mean,


how
 do
 you
 get
 uh
 everybody
 in
 your


direction?
 When
 you
 have
 a
 when
 you
 have


people,
 okay,
 when
 you
 have
 people
 and


you
 have
 a
 relation
 with
 those
 people,


you
 discuss
 also
 about
 business
 most
 of


all,
 most
 importantly,
 you
 discuss
 about


them
 as
 people.
 So
 I
 know
 what
 the


people
 do.
 I
 know
 for
 example
 Yakopo
 is


the
 son
 of
 a
 a
 guy
 that
 was
 born
 a
 few


weeks
 ago.
 So
 I
 keep
 asking
 about
 Yakopo


or
 I
 keep
 asking
 what
 the
 son
 or
 the


daughter
 is
 doing.
 This
 kind
 is
 bringing


some
 link
 so
 they
 don't
 see
 me
 far
 away.


They
 see
 me
 close.
 So
 but
 does
 it
 help?


So
 you
 all
 live
 in
 the
 same
 village,


right?
 I
 mean
 Marlo
 is
 that
 that
 is
 a


big
 advantage.
 No
 doubt
 that
 is
 a
 big


advantage.
 But
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 it's
 not
 a


village
 by
 the
 way.
 Yeah.
 Don't
 offend


please.


No
 look
 but
 when
 I
 was
 also
 in
 the other


company
 my
 people
 were
 spread
 over
 21


location
 and
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 that
 I
 have


the
 same
 link
 that
 I
 have
 Marinelo


Marinelo
 is
 easier
 because
 we
 are
 on
 the


same
 place
 you're
 right
 but
 also
 when
 I


was
 in
 the
 previous
 company
 I
 was


traveling
 like
 hell
 like
 some
 colleague


here
 in
 the
 room
 I
 you
 can
 have
 the
 same


kind
 of
 relation
 I
 have
 some
 friends
 in


some
 in
 Czech
 Republic
 I'm
 regular
 in


touch
 but
 do
 you
 think
 but
 do
 you
 think


being
 Italian
 is
 something
 different.
 I


mean
 is
 it
 more
 there
 is
 more
 uh
 you


know
 focus
 on
 family,
 friends,
 uh
 food


of
 course
 you
 are
 very
 good
 at
 you're


very
 good
 at
 cutting
 the
 reindeer
 by
 the


way.
 Um
 but
 do
 you
 think
 there
 is
 this


focus
 on
 family
 and
 which
 makes
 it
 into


I
 I
 don't
 think
 is
 a
 matter
 I
 have
 a
 lot


of
 friends
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 business


people
 from
 all
 over
 the
 world
 but
 they


are
 very
 good.
 So,
 so
 what
 you
 the
 only


things
 you
 can
 say
 that
 maybe


some
 some
 for
 some
 Italians
 especially


from
 south
 of


Italy
 they
 may
 have
 the
 advantage
 to
 be


a
 little
 bit
 more
 direct
 but


I
 don't
 know
 not
 more
 direct
 more
 in
 the


human


relation
 more
 easy
 to
 to
 start
 I
 mean


but
 where
 where
 do
 you
 want
 what
 are
 you


trying
 to
 change
 now
 at
 Ferrari
 what


part
 of
 the
 culture
 are
 you
 working
 on


uh
 I'm
 working
 on
 two


dimension.
 One,
 I
 want
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to


increase
 this
 speed
 because
 I
 still
 need


the
 12
 points
 to
 go
 from
 18
 to
 30.
 I


think
 that
 uh
 I
 am
 identifying
 together


with
 the
 team
 some
 areas
 that
 it
 makes


sense
 for
 us
 to
 delete
 because
 they
 do


not
 add
 value.
 So
 this
 is
 if
 you
 want
 on


the
 process
 side
 on
 the
 on
 the
 on
 the


client
 side
 I
 think
 that
 we
 start
 we


need
 like
 like
 I
 say
 we
 need
 to
 expand


beyond
 the
 classical
 you
 know
 we
 have
 a


lot
 of
 repeaters
 that
 is
 good
 we
 the


team
 also
 so
 you
 mean
 repeaters
 repeat


client
 that
 are
 buying
 the
 same
 the
 same


client
 that
 are
 buying
 cars
 so
 they
 are


around
 75%
 we
 have
 your
 biggest


Norwegian
 client
 in
 the
 audience
 today


thank
 you
 for
 your
 trust
 you
 I
 would


like
 no
 I
 think
 that
 we
 need
 also
 to


expand
 the
 client
 base
 we
 are
 doing
 good


progress
 because
 40%
 of
 new
 client
 are


younger
 than
 40
 years
 and
 uh
 but
 I
 think


there
 is
 still
 opportunity
 here
 and
 I


think
 we
 need
 to
 do
 some
 progress
 also


in
 the
 experience
 we
 provide
 to
 our


client
 because
 in
 a
 luxury
 company
 the


product
 is
 important
 but
 also
 the


experience
 is
 very
 important
 so
 this
 is


another
 dimension
 what
 do
 what
 do
 you


mean
 by
 that
 look
 we're
 organizing


regularly
 special
 event
 special


experience
 on
 track
 on
 road
 with
 the


client.
 In
 the
 next
 few
 weeks
 we
 will


have
 client
 that
 will
 join
 all
 together


in
 Spain
 or
 in
 Patagonia
 driving
 the


Ferrari.
 But
 we
 will
 also
 experience


people
 that
 are
 fun
 of
 driving.
 They
 buy


their
 racing
 uh
 cars
 and
 they're
 fun
 of


driving
 in
 um
 on
 the
 track.
 So
 this
 is


the
 experience
 that
 we
 want
 to
 bring
 on


the
 track
 on
 the
 on
 the
 client.
 Mhm.
 So


um
 last
 question.
 What
 do
 you
 um
 where


do
 you
 see
 where
 do
 you
 think
 Ferrari


will
 be
 in
 10
 years
 time?


What
 I
 think
 uh
 what
 I
 want
 the
 Ferrari


to
 be
 is
 a
 company
 that
 is


faster
 that
 is
 uh
 continues
 to
 be
 more


and
 more


open
 where
 uh
 really
 the
 mutual
 respect


stays
 there
 as
 a
 value
 where
 we
 listen


and
 we
 anticipate
 we
 continue
 to


anticipate
 which
 are
 the
 product
 the


client
 is
 willing
 to
 to
 have
 from
 us.
 So


I
 would
 like
 that
 we
 continue
 to
 do
 and


we
 improve
 we
 keep
 improving
 in


delivering
 emotion-driven
 innovation.
 No


technology
 push
 no
 market
 pull


emotion-driven
 innovation
 because
 only


in
 that
 way
 you
 make
 a
 difference.
 If


you
 wait
 too
 much
 or
 if
 you
 push
 the


technology
 is
 not
 innovation
 it's


cutting
 you
 know
 copy
 and
 paste
 and
 you


have
 said
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 too


many
 screens.
 No
 why
 there
 are
 a
 couple


of
 them
 already.
 Why
 don't
 why
 don't
 you


want
 to
 have
 too
 many
 screens
 in
 a


Ferrari?
 Look,
 I
 coming
 from


semiconductor
 companies,
 I
 know
 that
 uh


what
 is
 useful,
 what
 is
 not
 useful
 in
 a


car,
 what
 is
 useful
 for
 the
 client,
 what


is
 useful
 for
 a
 supplier.
 I
 think
 that


screen
 are
 very
 much
 useful
 for
 the


supplier
 more
 than
 for
 the


client.
 Yeah.
 And
 you
 think
 you
 are
 in
 a


Ferrari
 to
 drive
 not
 to
 watch
 TV.
 I


believe
 Ferrari
 is
 a
 car
 that
 people


like
 to
 drive.
 It's
 not
 a
 sofa
 on
 wheel.


is
 not
 a
 mobile
 phone
 on
 for
 is
 not
 a


data
 center
 on
 for
 whale.
 Some
 of
 people


here
 present
 became
 part
 of
 the


community.
 Thanks
 for
 their
 trust
 and
 uh


you
 will
 have
 you
 will
 continue
 to
 have


fun
 when
 driving
 Ferrari.
 You
 will
 not


see
 cinema.
 Very
 good.
 Thank
 you.


Thanks
 Benetto
 and
 Nikolai.
 That
 was


really


interesting.
 Our
 final
 speaker
 for
 the


first
 session
 on
 best
 companies
 is


Professor

 Hansen
 from
 the


University
 of
 California,
 Berkeley.


Morton

 our
 thinking


of
 business
 excellence
 through
 his


influential
 books,
 Great
 by
 Choice
 and


Great
 at


Work.
 Named
 as
 one
 of
 the
 most


influential
 management
 thinkers
 by


Thinkers
 50,
 Morton
 helps
 organizations


and
 individuals
 become
 truly
 great
 at


work.
 Morton,
 the
 stage
 is
 yours.

Good
 afternoon
 everyone.
 It's
 great
 to


be
 here.
 This
 is
 a
 place
 I
 grew
 up
 in


Oslo.
 Four
 amazing
 companies.
 Tremendous


to
 hear
 from.


Um
 what
 makes
 a
 really
 great
 company?


This
 is
 a
 fascinating
 question
 that
 I


spent
 decades
 researching.
 And
 one
 of


the
 things
 we
 have
 done
 is
 that
 we
 have


done
 three
 studies
 published
 in
 three


books.
 Built
 to
 last,
 good
 to
 great
 and


great
 by
 choice.
 And
 uh
 pro
 Benadetto


probably
 would
 take
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 time


to
 read
 all
 three
 books.
 I
 hope
 it's


worth
 your
 time.
 Uh
 so
 uh
 what
 are
 these


all
 about
 in
 built
 to
 last?
 What
 we
 did


was
 to
 say
 what
 are
 some
 of
 the
 enduring


principles
 of
 great
 companies
 over
 the


long


hall
 and
 we
 studied
 that
 in
 the
 context


of
 United
 States
 and
 we're
 looking
 at


those
 companies
 that
 have
 endured
 for


decades
 even
 more
 than
 50
 years
 and
 we


heard
 from
 many
 of
 them
 today
 and
 we're


using
 cumulative
 shareholder
 return
 over


the
 long
 haul
 as
 a
 metric
 compared
 to


the
 market
 and
 industry
 that
 they're
 in


and
 as
 you
 can
 see
 from
 this
 graph
 many


of
 these
 rise
 rose
 above
 the
 crowd
 to


become
 a
 truly
 great
 company.
 That
 was


the
 first
 study.
 In
 a
 second


study,
 the
 question
 was,
 can
 a
 good


company
 become
 great?
 And
 if
 so,
 how?


And
 of
 course,
 not
 all
 companies
 are


born
 great.
 They
 have
 to
 transition
 like


in
 this
 hockey
 stick
 that
 you're
 seeing


here.


And
 in
 the
 third
 study,
 we
 asked
 a


different
 question
 which
 was
 in
 a
 world


full
 of
 change
 and
 uncertainty
 like
 the


one
 we
 live
 in


today,
 what
 do
 you
 do
 as
 a
 leader
 to


navigate
 that
 circumstance
 to
 become
 a


truly
 great
 company
 and
 attain
 that
 kind


of
 extraordinary
 performance
 over
 the


long
 hall.


So
 these
 are
 the
 studies
 that
 we
 have


done
 and
 we
 have
 to
 sit
 you
 at
 what
 we


just
 heard
 from
 these
 four
 amazing


companies
 into
 some
 of
 this


research.
 First
 characteristic
 that
 is


important
 is
 that
 we
 have
 to
 look
 over


the
 long
 term
 when
 we
 think
 about
 what


makes
 for
 a
 great
 company.
 We're
 not


talking
 about
 short-term
 performance


three
 years,
 5
 years,
 10
 years.
 We're


talking
 beyond
 that.
 That's
 all
 of
 the


studies
 that
 we
 have
 looked
 at.
 You
 have


to
 stand
 the
 the
 test
 of
 time.
 And
 these


four
 companies
 we
 just
 heard
 from
 stood


the
 test
 of
 time.
 I
 plotted
 them
 here
 on


the
 timeline.
 Utis
 being
 the
 oldest
 one


founded
 before
 the
 American
 Civil
 War.


Then
 we
 have
 uh
 Goldman
 Sachs
 also
 this


era
 back
 then
 and
 Nova
 Nordisk
 and
 the


youngest
 company
 we
 just
 heard
 from
 is


Ferrari
 but
 is
 more
 than
 100
 years


old.
 Why
 is
 that
 important?


They
 have
 traversed
 circumstances
 of


hardship,
 recessions,
 even
 a
 depression,


wars,
 downturns,
 industry
 cycle,
 and
 yet


they
 have
 come
 out
 great.
 That's
 the


first
 characteristic.
 The
 second
 we
 have


to
 look
 for
 is
 to


ask
 compared
 to
 what.
 We
 can't
 just
 look


at
 successful
 company
 and
 say
 what
 did


they
 do?
 In
 academic
 research,
 we
 call


that
 selecting
 on
 the
 outcome
 variable


of
 success
 only
 and
 that's
 a
 bias.
 So
 we


have
 to
 look
 at
 what
 have
 they
 done
 that


was
 different
 and
 better
 than
 what


industry
 peers
 did
 at
 the
 same
 time.


Industry
 peer
 that
 had
 the
 same


opportunity
 back
 in
 the
 day
 to
 become


great
 but
 became
 only
 merely
 good
 or


worse.
 So
 what
 we're
 looking
 for
 are


principles
 that
 separate
 the
 great
 from


the
 good.
 Let
 me
 share
 a
 few
 of
 those


principles
 and
 relate
 them
 to
 what
 we


just
 heard.
 So
 the
 first
 principle
 is


that
 these
 companies
 had
 this
 duality


about
 them.
 On
 one
 hand
 they
 focused
 on


preserving
 the
 core
 core
 purpose
 values


and
 principles
 and
 we
 just
 heard
 that


today.
 Nova
 Nordisk
 about
 chronic


diseases,
 Goldman
 Sachs
 customer


excellence
 and
 partnership
 and
 so
 forth.


It's
 a
 very
 clear
 purpose
 that
 remains


stable
 over
 time.
 So
 that's
 one
 part.


The
 other
 part
 of
 the
 duality
 is


everything
 else
 is
 up
 for
 change
 and


progress
 and
 relentless
 innovation
 like


we
 also
 heard
 innovation
 in
 Ferrari
 no


Nordisk
 the
 flywheel
 of
 Otis
 everything


done
 in
 Goldman
 Sachs
 right
 there's
 that


duality
 about
 these
 two
 companies
 now


what
 is
 interesting
 is
 that
 many


companies
 and
 leaders
 they
 confuse
 the


two
 what
 should
 remain
 constant
 and


stable
 over
 time
 and
 what
 should
 not


here's
 an
 example
 of
 that
 many
 years
 ago


The
 leaders
 at
 IBM
 decided
 that
 they


corporate
 their
 salesforce
 and
 employees


should
 dress
 like
 their
 corporate


clients.
 And
 back
 in
 the
 day,
 the


clients
 were
 wearing
 a
 suit
 and
 a
 tie.


So
 then
 the
 salesforce
 started
 wearing
 a


suit,
 a
 tie
 and
 ideally
 a
 blue


shirt
 and
 that
 become
 the
 matching


because
 they
 were
 in
 a
 customer
 service


business
 and
 the
 idea
 was
 to
 gain


respect
 and
 credibility
 with
 the
 clients


they
 served.
 Good
 idea.


Then
 years
 passed
 by
 and
 they
 started


dropping
 the
 clients
 started
 dropping


the
 suit
 and
 the
 tie
 and
 so
 forth,


particularly
 in
 the
 tech
 sector.
 But
 the


IBM
 dress
 code
 marched
 on
 decade
 after


decade
 until
 one
 day
 a
 new
 CEO
 from
 the


outside,
 Lou
 Gersonner,
 walked
 in
 the


door
 and
 asked,
 "Why
 are
 you
 dressed


like
 that?"
 And
 he
 had
 no
 good
 answer


because
 30,
 40
 years
 ago,
 it
 was
 a
 good


answer,
 but
 no
 longer.
 It
 had
 become


dogma
 a
 practice.
 That's
 the
 way
 we
 do


things
 around
 here.
 That's
 kind
 of


culture
 to
 dress
 like
 that.
 Of
 course


not.
 Gerson
 stopped
 it.
 That
 was
 a


practice
 that
 got
 confused
 by
 what
 was


the
 culture.
 The
 culture
 was
 customer


service.
 But
 the
 practice
 addressing


like
 that
 was
 just
 a
 practice
 that
 had


become


obsolete.
 Leadership
 implication


challenge
 the
 status
 quo.
 what
 should


change
 and
 what
 should
 remain
 stable


over
 time.
 That's
 the
 first
 principle.


The
 second
 principle
 I'd
 like
 to
 share


is
 this
 idea
 that
 this
 company
 had
 a


pierce
 and
 clarity
 about
 the
 operating


model.
 And
 I'm
 so
 glad
 we
 heard
 from


Otus
 today
 because
 you
 just
 provided
 a


fantastic
 example
 of
 this
 idea.
 You
 call


it
 the
 flywheel.
 Those
 of
 you
 are


familiar
 with
 the
 book
 Good
 to
 Great,


you
 will
 recognize
 these
 three


intersecting
 circles.
 What
 this
 company


had
 going
 for
 them
 was
 very
 clear
 what


they
 can
 be
 the
 best
 at
 in
 the
 world
 and


that's
 what
 we
 heard
 today
 the
 excellent


of
 Goldman
 Sachs
 what
 Nova
 Nordis
 can
 do


Otis
 can
 do
 and
 Ferrari
 right
 you
 you


answer
 this
 question
 but
 then
 there
 is
 a


second
 question
 and
 that
 is
 passion
 that


the
 employees
 coming
 to
 the
 working
 for


the
 company
 feels
 the
 passion
 for
 the


company
 they
 feel
 passion
 for
 what


they're
 doing
 they
 feel
 passion
 for
 the


customer
 but
 in
 that
 I
 mentioned
 so
 much


about
 the
 employees
 and
 the
 passion
 that


they
 have
 coming
 and
 working
 at
 Ferrari.


Then
 the
 third
 thing
 is
 having
 that


profit
 model
 economic
 engine.
 And
 when


you
 answer
 these
 three
 questions,
 you


get
 an
 operating
 model.
 Here's
 an


example.
 Great
 by
 choice.
 We


studied
 Southwest


Airlines.
 This
 is
 their
 business
 model.


Bus
 on


wings.
 Just
 to
 be
 clear,
 that's
 not
 an


actual
 bus.
 That's
 an
 AI
 generated
 image


by
 my
 slide


designer.
 Uh
 what
 does
 that
 mean?
 They


figured
 out
 that
 this
 operating
 model
 is


going
 from
 A
 to
 B,
 no
 frills,
 no


luxuries,
 free
 seating
 and
 so
 forth.
 We


get
 you
 there.
 Many
 others
 that
 copy


this
 model
 later
 on.
 Historically
 the


most
 successful
 business
 model
 in
 in
 the


airline
 industry
 in
 the
 United
 States.


Some
 years
 ago,
 the
 then
 CEO
 Howard


Patnham
 described
 the
 model.
 What
 was


the
 upbringing
 model?
 This
 is
 what
 he


wrote
 in
 the
 Wall
 Street
 transcript.
 He


said,
 "This
 is
 what
 we
 do.
 Under
 two


hours
 only,
 you
 737s
 only,
 quicks,
 10


minutes
 at
 the
 gate,
 in
 and
 out
 in
 10


minutes.
 Low
 fear,
 high
 frequency,
 keep


it
 fun,
 no
 interlining,
 no
 food,
 people,


not
 mail,
 no
 seat
 assignment,
 bags,
 fly


free."


It's
 a
 brilliant
 articulation
 of
 an


operating
 model
 for
 an


airline,
 right?
 Everybody
 can
 understand


it.
 You're
 that
 flight
 attendant.
 You


understand
 it.
 Of
 course,
 some
 of
 these


things
 have
 evolved
 over
 time.
 You
 apply


fly
 wells,
 you
 evolve
 it,
 you
 expand
 it,


you
 become
 better
 at


it.
 But
 it's
 that
 kind
 of
 piercing


clarity
 and
 what
 we're
 about
 and
 what


we're
 not
 trying
 to
 do
 that
 really
 makes


a
 difference
 of
 these
 companies.


Third


principle
 driving


progress
 and
 particularly
 how
 did
 this


company
 drive


progress.
 Here's
 another
 company
 we


studied
 which
 is
 progressive
 insurance


in
 United
 States
 and
 one
 year
 they


decided
 that
 they
 were
 looking
 at
 the


market
 to
 enter
 of
 insurance
 for
 trucks


big
 cars.
 They
 did
 an
 exhaustive


analysis
 and
 they
 figured
 out
 this
 seems


attractive
 and
 they
 decided
 on


aggressive
 investment
 into
 that
 market.


Turned
 out
 to
 be
 a
 failure
 and
 they
 had


to
 pull
 back
 for
 a
 variety
 of


reasons.
 Then
 a
 few
 years
 later
 they


decided
 to
 go
 into
 the
 market
 for
 safe


drivers.
 Here
 they
 can't
 the
 approach


was
 completely


different.
 Let's
 do
 experiments.
 Let's


start
 small.
 Let's
 start
 with
 a
 thousand


subscribers
 in
 Florida.
 next
 year
 Texas


and
 so
 on.
 And
 after
 three
 years
 of


experimentation,
 they
 then
 figure
 out


this
 is
 how
 we
 can
 make
 money
 in
 this


market.
 We
 have
 a
 good
 pricing
 model
 and


then
 they
 launched
 aggressively
 across


the
 United
 States.
 Very
 different


approaches
 and
 the
 key
 here
 is
 that
 in


markets
 uh
 that
 characterize
 uncertainty


there
 is
 a
 premium
 of
 experimentation.


experimentation
 and
 not
 just
 analysis


gives
 you
 empirical
 validation
 for
 what


works.
 So
 these
 companies
 we
 studied
 and


I
 think
 we
 heard
 it
 from
 today
 of


innovation


experimentation
 but
 in
 that
 I
 remember


on
 the
 podcast
 when
 Nikolai
 you
 talked


about
 in
 electric
 vehicles
 and
 how
 you


have
 experimented
 with
 that
 for
 several


years
 right
 it
 takes
 like
 a
 long
 time
 to


experiment
 you
 got
 to
 be
 patient
 but


doing
 that
 creates
 a
 culture
 of


experimentation
 and
 that's
 what
 we
 saw


in
 these
 companies
 and
 that
 is
 that
 you


got
 to
 have
 starting
 a
 lot
 of
 exper


experiments
 both
 in
 products
 and


processes


pilots,
 test
 marketers,
 demos,
 and
 so


forth.
 Going
 to
 kill
 the
 bad
 ones.
 Then


you're
 going
 to
 have
 the
 courage
 to
 go


all
 in
 on
 some
 of
 the
 very
 good
 ones
 and


scale
 it
 aggressively.
 This
 means
 that


you
 have
 to
 have
 a
 culture
 of


appropriate
 risk-taking
 and
 learning


that
 professor
 James
 talked
 about
 in
 the


opening
 remarks.
 Having
 that
 openness
 to


learning
 and
 being
 able
 to
 have
 that


culture
 that
 drive
 the
 progress


forward.
 So
 three
 principles
 preserve


the
 core
 stimulate
 progress
 a
 very
 clear


operating
 model
 and
 a
 premium
 of


experimentation
 to
 drive


progress.
 So
 what
 do
 we
 not
 find
 in
 some


of
 our


research?
 Well,
 one
 thing


is
 were
 these
 leaders
 visionaries?
 No,


it's
 not
 the
 idea
 that
 they
 could
 see


where
 the
 business
 is
 going
 to
 be
 10


years
 from
 now.
 I
 mean,
 who
 can
 predict


where
 we're
 going to
 be
 10
 years
 from


now
 in
 any
 industry
 and
 sort
 of
 point


the
 company
 toward
 that
 destination?


Absolutely
 not.
 We
 do
 not
 see
 that.


Another
 one
 that
 comes
 up
 is
 this
 one.


Were
 the
 leaders
 charismatic?
 Well,
 some


were.
 We
 saw
 that


today.
 And
 some
 were
 not.
 It's
 a


nonvariable.
 And
 then


finally,
 what
 about
 luck?


Maybe
 this
 is
 just
 a
 random
 walk
 that


the
 great
 companies
 that
 we
 see
 are
 just


we're
 just
 lucky
 the
 right
 place
 at
 the


right


time.
 And
 our
 answer
 is


no.
 Why?
 Because
 we
 studied
 luck.
 We
 had


these
 great
 companies
 and
 then
 we
 had


the
 merely
 good
 one,
 the
 average


industry
 peers.
 And
 over
 the
 long
 time


all
 these
 companies
 had
 a
 fair
 amount
 of


bad
 luck
 and
 good
 luck.
 And
 the
 question


is,
 what
 are
 you
 doing
 with
 that
 luck?


What
 are
 you
 doing
 with
 the
 good
 luck


and
 seize
 the
 moment?
 And
 what
 are
 you


doing
 to
 be
 prepared
 to
 weather
 the


storms?
 And
 so
 therefore,
 let
 me
 then


close
 since
 we're
 in
 Norway,
 a
 quote
 by


our
 great
 Norwegian
 explorer
 Ru


Ammonson,
 who
 said,
 "Victory,


um,
 there
 we
 are.
 Victory
 awaits
 the


person
 who
 has
 everything
 in
 order.


luck.
 Some
 people
 call


it
 greatness
 is
 not
 a
 function
 of


circumstant
 luck.
 Greatness
 is
 a


function
 of
 the
 lead
 the
 choices
 that


the
 leaders
 have
 made
 over
 time
 to
 build


a
 great
 company
 culture
 as
 we
 heard
 from


today
 of
 these
 four
 amazing
 companies.


Thank


you.
 As
 financial
 markets
 continue
 to


evolve
 in
 complexity
 and
 technological


sophistication,
 few
 companies
 have


transitioned
 as
 effectively
 as
 NASDAQ.


Adena
 Freriedman
 is
 the
 CEO
 and
 chair
 of


NASDAQ.
 Under
 her
 guidance,
 she
 has


transformed
 the
 company
 from
 a


traditional
 exchange
 to
 a
 leading
 global


technology
 company
 servicing
 the


financial
 markets.
 Joining
 Adena
 on


stage
 for
 a
 fireside
 chat
 is
 our
 very


own
 chief
 investment
 officer
 of
 NBIM's


market
 strategies,
 Marlon
 Nordbach.


Please
 join
 me
 in
 welcoming
 Adena
 and


[Applause]


Marlin.
 How
 are
 you?


Hi,
 great
 to
 have
 you
 here
 today,
 Adina.


As
 the
 CEO
 of
 NASDAQ,
 you
 must
 have
 some


really,
 really
 unique
 insights
 into


companies.
 No
 pressure.
 No,
 it's
 great


to
 be
 here.
 So,
 we've
 just
 heard
 about


what
 makes
 the
 best
 companies.
 So,
 do


you
 want
 to
 start
 by
 telling
 us
 what


makes
 NASDAQ
 a
 great
 company?
 Well,


thank
 you
 for
 that.
 Um,
 so
 I
 always


think
 about
 it
 from
 the
 eyes
 of
 the


investor
 and
 of
 course
 that
 ultimately


res,
 you
 know,
 results
 in
 the
 financial


performance
 of
 the
 company.
 So
 just
 a


quick
 recap
 of
 our
 finances
 over
 the


last
 year.
 So
 we've
 grown
 about
 10%
 in


the
 last
 year.
 We
 have
 a
 57%
 IBIDA


margin.
 So
 that
 if
 we
 were
 a
 SAS


company,
 we'd
 be
 a
 rule
 of
 67,
 which
 is


pretty
 good.
 And
 102%
 cash
 flow


conversion
 in
 our
 business.
 So
 it's
 a


very
 cash
 flow
 generative
 business.
 And


all
 of
 that,
 I
 think,
 allows
 um
 us
 to


have
 the
 latitude
 to
 continue
 to
 grow


and
 expand
 the
 business
 because
 we're


delivering
 great
 performance.
 But
 when


we
 say,
 well,
 what
 really
 underpins


that?
 like
 what
 results
 what
 how
 do
 we


drive
 those
 kind
 of
 results.
 The
 first


thing
 is
 that
 we
 really
 focus
 on
 having


a
 very
 very
 strong
 northstar
 that
 really


guides
 all
 of
 our
 strategic
 decision-m


and
 our
 northstar
 is
 our
 purpose
 really


which
 is
 quite
 big
 and
 broad
 is
 to


empower
 economic
 progress
 around
 the


world
 which
 is
 a
 very
 big
 and
 broad
 a


broad
 purpose
 but
 our
 northstar
 is
 our


vision
 and
 our
 vision
 is
 to
 be
 the


trusted
 fabric
 to
 the
 world's
 financial


system
 and
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 that
 we


look
 at
 that
 really
 through
 the
 lens
 of


technology
 how
 do
 we
 make
 sure
 that
 our


markets
 are
 as
 technologically
 advanced


as
 possible.
 How
 do
 we
 provide
 leading


software
 that
 really
 allows
 for
 us
 to


help
 the
 the
 industry
 manage
 risk
 and


really
 maximize
 our
 opportunity
 in
 the


markets
 along
 three
 key
 vectors
 of


liquidity,
 transparency,
 and
 integrity?


And
 then
 how
 do
 we
 also
 make
 sure
 that


inside
 the
 company
 um
 we're
 we're


staying
 humble
 and
 confident
 at
 the
 same


time.
 So
 we
 talk
 a
 lot
 about
 that
 kind


of
 what
 we
 call
 humble
 confidence
 or
 I


think
 it's
 it's
 important
 to
 recognize


that
 there's
 so
 much
 to
 learn
 all
 the


time.
 The
 minute
 a
 company
 becomes


complacent
 is
 the
 minute
 they
 begin
 to


decline.
 And
 it's
 particularly
 in
 this


world
 of
 technological
 transformation


that
 is
 changing
 really
 every
 industry,


every
 part
 of
 what
 we
 can
 be.
 We
 can
 use


technology
 differently
 to
 drive
 our


business
 forward.
 You
 have
 to
 be
 a


constant
 learner.
 You
 have
 to
 make
 sure


that
 you're
 always
 bringing
 new


capabilities
 into
 your
 organization
 and


you're
 pushing
 to
 be
 better
 all
 the


time.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 with
 that


northstar
 and
 that
 humble
 confidence,
 I


think
 that's
 really
 what
 we
 see
 as
 being


the
 underpinnings
 of
 what
 what
 we're


trying
 to
 achieve
 as
 a
 great
 company.


Yeah.
 And
 the
 point
 about
 learning
 is


really
 important.
 And
 you've
 learned
 a


lot.
 You've
 been
 in
 NASA
 for
 a
 long


time.
 You
 started
 as
 an
 intern
 back
 in


the
 days
 and
 you've
 had
 a
 quite
 a


remarkable
 journey
 to
 CEO.
 So
 can
 you


tell
 us
 what
 learnings
 have
 you
 made


along
 the
 way
 and
 uh
 how
 has
 NASDAQ


transformed
 under
 your
 leadership?
 Well,


NASDAQ
 really
 was
 quite
 different
 when
 I


started
 32
 years
 ago.
 So
 um
 and
 you
 were


kind
 not
 to
 tell
 people
 how
 long
 that


would
 been.


Um,
 but
 yeah,
 I
 I
 did
 start
 in
 the


trading
 division
 at
 NASDAQ.
 And
 at
 the


time,
 you
 know,
 we
 were
 of
 of
 course


then
 a
 a
 great
 market,
 but
 we
 were
 still


really
 a
 very
 young
 company
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 how
 to
 be
 a
 commercial


enterprise,
 how
 to
 drive
 markets
 forward


in
 a
 different
 way.
 And
 we've
 been
 on
 a


journey
 now
 for
 for
 that
 entire
 period


of
 time
 to
 really
 try
 to
 transform
 our


business
 and
 to
 have
 a
 bigger
 impact
 in


the
 industry.
 So
 we've
 gone
 from
 being
 a


really
 transformative
 market
 operator


within
 the
 United
 States
 um
 to
 growing


and
 expanding
 into
 multiple
 asset


classes
 with
 equities
 and
 options
 in
 the


US
 expanding
 into
 Europe
 and
 we'll
 talk


about
 that.
 We
 own
 and
 operate
 most
 of


the
 exchanges
 in
 the
 Nordics
 with
 the


exception
 of
 Ozor.
 Um
 so
 we
 we
 are
 um
 a


very
 scale
 player
 here
 in
 Europe
 and


then
 we've
 really
 expanded
 to
 um
 go
 into


the
 software
 business
 and
 it
 started


actually
 with
 the
 acquisition
 of
 OMX


which
 was
 the
 Nordic
 operator
 where
 they


had
 um
 a
 market
 technology
 business


within
 their
 organization
 and
 it
 was


kind
 of
 this
 hidden
 gem
 but
 it
 really


what
 it
 did
 was
 it
 globalized
 the


business
 and
 the
 impact
 that
 the
 company


had
 on
 markets
 around
 the
 world.
 So


today
 we
 provide
 technology
 to
 135


markets
 around
 the
 world.
 We
 provide


technology
 to
 3,600
 banks
 and
 brokerage


firms
 around
 the
 world
 in
 all
 of
 their


key
 vectors
 of
 of
 risk
 management
 and


trade
 operations.
 And
 so
 with
 that,
 I


think
 we've
 become
 a
 much
 more
 scaled


business,
 a
 bigger
 partner
 to
 the


clients.
 And
 it's
 interesting
 because
 by


helping
 them
 maximize
 liquidity,
 helping


them
 maximize
 the
 transparency
 within


the
 system
 and
 the
 integrity
 of
 the


system,
 that
 really
 occurs
 to
 the


benefit
 of
 markets.
 And
 so
 it
 kind
 of


comes
 full
 circle
 back
 into
 us
 being
 um


even
 more
 equipped
 to
 be
 a
 great
 market


operator.
 I
 think
 you're
 touching
 a
 bit


on
 that,
 but
 NASDAQ,
 well,
 I
 think
 most


most
 people
 still
 think
 of
 NASDAQ
 as


mostly
 an
 exchange,
 but
 you
 do
 much
 more


than
 that.
 and
 uh
 you're
 for
 example


very
 involved
 in
 in
 complexity
 of
 the


financial
 system
 and
 uh
 prevention
 of


financial
 crime.
 So
 what
 why
 is
 that


important?
 Well
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 if


if
 we
 have
 uh
 integrity
 in
 the
 system


people
 will
 trust
 the
 system
 and
 we
 want


ultimately
 for
 investors
 to
 feel
 a
 great


deal
 of
 trust
 when
 they're
 putting
 their


money
 putting
 money
 at
 risk
 um
 to
 to


drive
 savings
 and
 and
 wealth
 creation


for
 themselves.
 So
 we
 want
 to
 make
 sure


that
 the
 system
 itself
 works
 for
 them


and
 we
 focus
 a
 lot
 on
 those
 three
 key


pillars
 of
 liquidity,
 transparency,


integrity.
 Those
 are
 the
 underpinnings


of
 a
 great
 market
 but
 they're
 also
 the


underpinnings
 of
 a
 great
 financial


system.
 And
 uh
 our
 view
 is
 that
 that
 as


a
 market
 we
 can
 do
 so
 much
 to
 kind
 of


drive
 that.
 But
 as
 a
 technology
 provider


to
 markets,
 as
 a
 technology
 provider
 to


the
 financial
 the
 financial
 players,
 it


it
 kind
 of
 it
 allows
 us
 to
 spread
 those


three
 key
 pillars
 across
 the
 system
 more


effectively.
 And
 and
 frankly
 if
 we
 are


looking
 at
 some
 of
 the
 emerging
 markets


where
 we
 operate
 our
 solutions
 both
 our


market
 our
 market
 technology
 and
 our


broker
 dealer
 and
 uh
 financial
 uh
 the


banking
 technology
 it
 allows
 that
 whole


economy
 to
 lift
 itself
 up
 to
 be
 to
 be


able
 to
 um
 be
 more
 innovative
 themselves


drive
 innovation
 in
 their
 country
 drive


foreign
 investment
 into
 their
 country


because
 people
 trust
 the
 system
 more


which
 then
 of
 course
 creates
 that


positive
 flywheel
 of
 economic
 growth.


So,
 it's
 very
 important,
 but
 I
 think


that
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 we'll
 talk


more
 about
 financial
 crime,
 but
 it
 is


such
 a
 big
 problem
 within
 the
 industry


that
 it
 requires
 great
 technology
 to
 be


able
 to
 help
 solve
 that
 problem.
 And
 and


we're
 really
 proud
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the


technology
 providers
 to
 to
 work
 on
 that.


So,
 thinking
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the


theme
 of
 the
 conference
 and
 what
 makes


great
 companies.
 So,
 NASDAQ
 lists
 some


of
 the
 most
 innovative
 companies
 in
 the


world
 and
 uh
 many
 of
 the
 biggest
 tech


companies.
 So,
 what
 would
 you
 say?
 What


separates
 a
 good
 company
 from
 a
 truly


great
 one?
 Yeah.
 Well,
 first
 I
 I
 would


point
 to
 technology.
 Um,
 companies
 that


lean
 in
 to
 technology
 to
 help
 drive
 and


disrupt
 themselves
 to
 really
 think


differently
 about
 how
 to
 solve
 a
 problem


with
 the
 technology
 that
 exists
 today.


And
 then
 really,
 as
 I
 said
 before,
 is


constantly
 learning
 and
 striving
 to
 be


better
 at
 deploying
 technology
 to
 solve


problems.
 we
 see
 as
 in
 in
 any
 sector


that's
 not
 just
 as
 a
 technology
 company


but
 leveraging
 technology
 to
 solve
 a


problem
 differently
 and
 to
 drive
 to


drive
 the
 business
 forward
 we
 see
 as


definitely
 one
 of
 the
 ingredients.
 The


second
 is
 making
 sure
 that
 you
 operate
 a


resilient
 you
 in
 a
 in
 resilient
 manner.


Um,
 and
 it's
 interesting,
 you
 know,
 when


you
 meet
 some
 young
 entrepreneurs,
 they


they
 get
 very
 excited
 about
 what
 they're


doing,
 but
 they
 you
 also
 have
 to
 think


about
 what
 are
 you
 doing
 to
 create
 a


resilient
 business.
 And
 to
 me,
 uh,
 as
 I


mentioned,
 our
 cash
 flow
 conversion,
 you


know,
 cash
 is
 king.
 So,
 getting
 to
 a


state
 of
 profitability
 and
 cash
 flow,
 a


positive
 cash
 flow
 state
 is,
 I
 think,


should
 be
 the
 goal
 of
 every
 company


while
 they're
 still
 driving
 growth
 and


innovating
 in
 technology
 and
 technology


now
 can
 actually
 be
 an
 enabler
 of
 that.


You
 can
 leverage
 technology
 now
 to


become
 to
 drive
 growth
 more
 efficiently


to
 become
 more
 resilient
 and
 then
 to


make
 sure
 that
 you
 have
 a
 very
 strong


mission
 and
 a
 northstar
 that
 you
 can


communicate
 to
 investors
 that
 you
 can


then
 talk
 about
 the
 milestones
 that


you're
 going
 to
 take
 to
 achieve
 those


great
 ambitions
 and
 that
 you
 al


obviously
 have
 to
 execute
 against
 those.


So
 so
 that
 investors
 feel
 trust
 that


you're
 taking
 them
 on
 a
 journey
 that


they
 that
 they
 can
 understand
 and
 they


can
 see
 in
 front
 of
 them.
 but
 always


always
 striving
 to
 be
 better
 um
 in
 terms


of
 how
 you're
 solving
 the
 problems
 that


you've
 decided
 to
 solve
 with
 your


business.
 So
 you
 you're
 meeting
 with


companies
 be
 way
 before
 they
 choose
 to


go
 public
 and
 way
 before
 they
 list
 and


as
 they're
 working
 their
 way
 towards
 the


public
 markets.
 uh
 what
 are
 there
 any


lessons
 to
 be
 learned
 and
 can
 you
 can


you
 see
 who
 will
 uh
 going
 to
 be
 who
 is


going
 to
 be
 great
 and
 who
 will


ultimately
 well
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 comes
 back


to
 what
 I
 just
 said
 in
 terms
 of
 making


sure
 that
 you're
 driving
 towards
 a


really
 important
 goal
 making
 sure
 you're


building
 a
 truly
 resilient
 company
 and


that
 you're
 leveraging
 technology
 in


every
 possible
 way
 to
 be
 able
 to
 achieve


your
 vision
 and
 your
 mission.
 Um
 and
 but


even
 then
 you
 know
 not
 every
 company
 is


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 um
 uh
 you
 have
 to


recognize
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 also
 have
 to


look
 at
 what's
 the
 total
 market


opportunity
 in
 front
 of
 them
 and
 there


are
 other
 ingredients
 that
 also
 go
 into


an
 investment
 thesis
 like
 what
 is
 a


total
 market
 opportunity
 how
 fast
 is


that
 growing
 how
 well
 positioned
 are


they
 how
 quickly
 can
 they
 open
 the
 doors


but
 then
 lastly
 I
 would
 say
 making
 sure


from
 a
 resiliency
 perspective
 that


they're
 also
 thinking
 about
 that


integrity
 you
 know
 sometimes
 you
 want
 to


break
 something
 you
 want
 to
 break
 a


system
 to
 make
 it
 better.
 Uh,
 and
 I


think
 that's
 actually
 frankly
 been
 the


quintessential
 element
 of
 of
 a
 lot
 of


technological
 advancements
 and
 and
 the


innovation
 ecosystem
 that
 exists
 in
 the


US.
 But
 you
 also
 have
 to
 reflect
 on
 are


you
 ultimately
 providing
 a
 lasting


benefit
 to
 the
 end
 client
 or
 end


consumer
 and
 are
 they
 um
 you
 know
 and


are
 you
 breaking
 things
 that
 matter
 and


making
 sure
 that
 you're
 working
 within


the
 system
 when
 you
 need
 to
 and
 you're


trying
 to
 kind
 of
 create
 a
 new
 system


where
 you
 have
 the
 opportunity
 to
 but


ultimately
 for
 the
 end
 benefit
 of
 the


consumer.
 Yeah.
 So
 you
 often
 talk
 about


the
 Nordic
 stock
 markets
 and
 uh
 you


operate
 many
 of
 them
 not
 region
 as
 we


heard
 but
 um
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 Nordic


stock
 market
 stand
 out
 compared
 to
 many


other
 European
 markets
 and
 we're
 here
 in


Norway
 now.
 So
 I'm
 curious
 what
 makes


the
 Nordic
 capital
 market
 so
 dynamic


compared
 to
 some
 of
 some
 other
 markets.


Well,
 right
 now
 in
 Europe,
 there's
 a
 big


debate
 and
 discussion
 about
 how
 do
 we


improve
 and
 make
 the
 capital
 markets
 in


Europe
 more
 vibrant.
 Um,
 and
 and
 also


really
 to
 drive
 economic
 growth
 and


innovation
 within
 within
 the
 economies


here
 in
 Europe.
 And
 I've
 I've
 been


saying
 very
 consistently,
 you
 do
 not


need
 to
 look
 to
 the
 United
 States
 to


answer
 that
 question.
 You
 need
 to
 look


to
 Sweden
 and
 to
 the
 the
 broader
 Nordic


markets.
 And
 I
 use
 Sweden
 because
 we


have
 we
 own
 and
 operate
 the
 Swedish


Stock
 Exchange
 and
 we're
 very
 engaged


there.
 But
 we
 can
 also
 look
 to
 Denmark,


Finland,
 and
 Norway
 as
 being
 exemplars


of
 this.
 So
 if
 I
 u
 but
 I've
 studied


Sweden
 the
 most.
 So
 I'm
 going
 to
 start


there.
 Um
 so
 with
 Sweden,
 it's
 we
 love


to
 think
 that
 having
 NASDAQ
 as
 a
 market


operator
 there
 helps.
 Um
 and
 I
 do
 think


that
 the
 technological
 advancements
 and


things
 that
 we've
 done
 to
 really
 promote


the
 market
 ecosystem
 there
 have
 been
 an


ingredient
 to
 success.
 But
 it
 starts


much
 it's
 much
 bigger
 than
 that.
 Um,


first
 I
 think
 that
 the
 the
 countries


here
 in
 the
 Nordics
 have
 recognized
 that


they're
 small
 countries
 but
 they
 want
 to


have
 an
 outsized
 impact
 on
 the
 world.


They've
 decided,
 you
 know,
 very
 early
 on


um
 in
 the
 modern
 economy
 to
 be
 global


businesses
 to
 really
 promote
 global


trade
 and
 to
 go
 beyond
 their
 borders.
 So


that
 that
 notion
 of
 constantly
 looking


outside
 the
 system
 you're
 in
 to
 say
 what


impact
 can
 we
 have
 on
 the
 broader


economy
 around
 the
 world
 and
 to
 really


promote
 global
 businesses,
 number
 one.


Number
 two,
 to
 have
 a
 great
 university


system
 that
 really
 um
 kind
 of
 drives


towards
 the
 modern
 skills
 that
 are


needed
 to
 succeed
 in
 a
 modern
 economy.
 I


think
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 quintessential


elements
 of
 the
 Nordic
 system.
 The
 third


is
 the
 ability
 for
 ris
 like
 this


risk-taking
 culture
 and
 we
 talked
 about


in
 the
 United
 States.
 I
 think
 here
 in


the
 Nordics,
 the
 Nordic
 countries
 have


created
 this
 great
 social
 safety
 net.


And
 that
 as
 a
 result,
 if
 you're
 a
 cons
 a


citizen
 of
 the
 country
 and
 you
 have
 this


safe
 social
 safety
 net,
 you
 should
 be


taking
 more
 risk
 with
 your
 discretionary


capital.
 You
 should
 be
 re
 realizing
 that


as
 a
 result
 of
 having
 that
 great
 system


around
 you,
 you
 can
 take
 your
 capital


and
 take
 and
 and
 invest
 it
 as
 opposed
 to


just
 putting
 into
 a
 savings
 account
 and


drive
 wealth
 creation
 and
 give
 yourself


even
 more
 opportunity
 in
 life.
 And
 I


think
 that
 as
 a
 result
 they've
 done


these
 very
 specific
 tax
 um
 oriented
 um


uh
 program.
 So
 the
 most
 uh
 influential


has
 been
 the
 ISK
 program
 in
 Sweden.
 It's


a
 tax
 advantaged
 savings
 account.
 Um
 you


can
 invest
 in
 any
 as
 long
 as
 you
 put


your
 money
 into
 public
 equities.
 That's


that's
 your
 only
 obligation.
 You
 you
 get


you
 pay
 about
 1%
 tax
 on
 your
 total


holdings
 every
 year
 and
 there's
 no
 cap


gains
 tax.
 And
 the
 result
 of
 that
 has


been
 the
 ownership
 of
 equities
 within


the
 citizens
 of
 Sweden
 has
 been
 straight


up
 and
 to
 the
 right
 since
 2012
 since


that
 program
 was
 implemented.
 So
 it's


really
 kind
 of
 given
 it's
 actually


encouraging
 citizens
 to
 invest
 in


equities
 to
 to
 take
 that
 risk
 to
 d
 to


own
 their
 own
 financials
 to
 be


financially
 literate
 to
 help
 them
 kind


of
 drive
 their
 future
 and
 that
 then


creates
 a
 retail
 ecosystem
 inside
 the


country
 with
 a
 great
 pension
 system


inside
 our
 countries
 um
 that
 really


drives
 for
 that
 flywheel
 of
 economic


activity
 growth
 expansion
 we
 have
 1200


companies
 listed
 in
 the
 Nordics
 um
 we've


had
 450
 companies
 go
 public
 just
 in


Sweden
 alone.
 Oh,
 I'm
 sorry,
 across
 the


Nordics
 in
 the
 last
 5
 years.
 So,
 it's


really
 an
 it's
 an
 amazing
 system
 on
 the


back
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 intentional
 action.


Long
 answer,
 but
 really
 important.
 No,


but
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 really
 important


point
 and
 probably
 of
 interest
 to
 to
 the


people
 in
 this
 audience.
 So,
 um
 well


worth
 spending
 time
 on.
 Um
 so,
 going


back
 a
 little
 bit
 to
 technology
 and
 and


some
 of
 the
 technology
 advances
 that's


happening
 now.
 So
 how
 are
 you
 using


technologies
 like
 AI
 and
 cloud
 to
 power


and
 shape
 the
 future
 of
 the
 financial


markets?
 Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 think
 we
 we
 are


using
 it
 in
 two
 different
 ways.
 I
 would


actually
 point
 to
 the
 markets
 and
 then


I'll
 talk
 about
 our
 anti-financial
 crime


business
 where
 we
 have a
 lot
 of
 advanced


AI
 that
 we're
 using
 there.
 So
 in
 the


markets
 um
 we
 use
 we
 use
 AI
 to
 actually


make
 sure
 that
 we're
 managing
 our


capacity
 planning
 u
 in
 a
 very
 dynamic


way.
 We
 manage
 an
 enormous
 amount
 of


message
 traffic
 through
 our
 systems.
 For


example,
 in
 the
 first
 two
 weeks
 of


April,
 we
 had
 our
 peak
 day
 ever
 of
 550


billion
 messages
 that
 flowed
 through
 our


markets
 in
 in
 a
 day.
 Um,
 and
 so
 we
 have


to
 make
 sure
 we're
 managing
 our
 capacity


on
 a
 very
 dynamic
 level.
 So,
 we
 use
 AI


algorithms
 to
 help
 predict
 capacity


needs.
 The
 second
 is
 we
 have
 AIdriven
 um


order
 types
 in
 our
 markets
 um
 to
 really


kind
 of
 enhancing
 investor
 experience
 in


our
 markets.
 And
 then
 I
 think
 that
 the


the
 third
 is
 to
 use
 the
 best
 of
 cloud


capabilities.
 So,
 we
 have
 AWS
 as
 a


partner.
 they've
 come
 into
 our
 data


center.
 We've
 we've
 been
 moving
 our


markets
 to
 cloud
 technology
 now
 for
 a


couple
 of
 years
 and
 it's
 been
 a
 great


experience
 in
 terms
 of
 improving
 even


the
 scalability,
 the
 latency
 and
 all
 the


key
 characteristics
 of
 great
 markets


with
 part
 in
 our
 partnership
 with
 AWS.


So
 we
 know
 that
 that's
 really
 the
 future


of
 markets
 and
 we're
 excited
 to
 partner


with
 them
 now
 to
 bring
 all
 of
 that
 into


our
 Nordic
 markets
 and
 then
 to
 bring


that
 across
 the
 world
 to
 our
 market
 tech


clients.
 But
 AI
 I
 think
 is
 actually
 the


most
 effective
 use
 of
 AI
 within
 NASDAQ


has
 been
 in
 an
 anti-financial
 crime.
 So


we
 have
 a
 co
 company
 called
 Verafin
 that


we
 acquired
 um
 four
 and
 a
 half
 years
 ago


and
 they
 uh
 that
 that
 business
 and
 our


team
 really
 uses
 AI
 algorithms
 to
 root


out
 criminal
 actors.
 We
 bring
 all
 of
 the


data
 together.
 So
 we
 are
 allowed
 to


share
 data
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 So
 we


share
 I
 have
 a
 data
 consorcia
 across
 the


banks.
 to
 2,600
 banks
 in
 that
 consortia.


And
 it
 allows
 us
 to
 look
 for
 patterns


and
 practices
 of
 criminal
 behaviors
 and


be
 very
 specific
 in
 the
 topologies
 that


we
 write
 to
 to
 make
 it
 so
 we
 can
 be
 more


effective
 in
 rooting
 out
 criminals.
 And


then
 we
 use
 Gen
 AI
 um
 on
 automating


workflows.
 So
 as
 you're
 researching
 a


potentially
 bad
 actor,
 which
 by
 the
 way


there
 are
 thousands
 and
 thousands
 of


alerts
 that
 come
 out
 of
 your
 systems


every
 day.
 Um
 how
 do
 you
 make
 that
 as


efficient
 and
 automated
 as
 possible?
 So


we
 have
 this
 entity
 research
 co-pilot


that
 automates
 the
 process
 of


researching
 entities
 to
 look
 for


criminals
 um
 and
 then
 writes
 the
 report


um
 and
 so
 that
 all
 you
 have
 to
 do
 is


review
 review
 the
 report
 and
 submit.
 So


very
 cool.
 Yeah.
 So
 your
 NASDAQ
 you


mainly
 operate
 in
 public
 markets.
 So
 for


a
 while
 now
 there's
 been
 a
 global
 trend


that
 fewer
 and
 fewer
 companies
 are
 going


public.
 They're
 staying
 private
 for


longer
 or
 forever.
 So
 what's
 driving


this
 trend?
 And
 uh
 in
 your
 view,
 why


should
 companies
 work
 toward
 public


markets?
 Well,
 I
 I
 do
 think
 that
 there's


a
 cyclical
 element
 to
 that
 and
 then
 and


then
 a
 structural
 element
 to
 that.
 So,


you
 know,
 cyclcally
 speaking,
 you
 have
 a


world
 where
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 company
 a


lot
 of
 private
 capital
 that's
 growing.


It's
 growing
 at
 about
 it's
 about
 15
 in


2023,
 there's
 about
 15
 trillion
 of


private
 capital
 growing
 15%
 a
 year


versus
 $115
 trillion
 of
 public
 equity


capital,
 but
 only
 growing
 3%
 a
 year.
 So


you've
 got
 kind
 of
 a
 shift
 towards
 some


private
 private
 capital
 and
 that
 I
 think


goes
 towards
 um
 just
 the
 the
 trends


within
 within
 the
 the
 investment


ecosystem.
 But
 to
 fight
 that
 trend,
 you


have
 to
 therefore
 realize
 that
 there's


more
 competition.
 You
 know,
 you
 want
 the


public
 markets
 to
 be
 where
 everyone
 is


excited
 and
 strives
 to
 come
 into
 the


public
 markets
 to
 make
 their
 companies


accessible
 to
 everyday
 citizens,


everyday
 retail
 investors.
 and
 that
 the


only
 way
 to
 really
 do
 that
 at
 scale
 is


to
 go
 public
 and
 to
 to
 make
 it
 so
 that


the
 citizens
 of
 your
 country
 are
 engaged


in
 the
 growth
 of
 your
 country
 and
 you


create
 that
 virtuous
 flywheel
 of
 that


engagement
 through
 investment.
 So
 um
 we


have
 focused
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 policy
 issues


that
 exist
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Um
 so


everyone
 talks
 about
 the
 US
 as
 being


great
 markets
 and
 they
 are
 but
 we
 still


have
 had
 a
 decline
 in
 public
 companies


as
 well.
 And
 so
 we
 talk
 about
 um


disclosure
 obligations.
 Let's
 streamline


those.
 let's
 take
 some
 of
 the
 burden
 off


the
 companies
 there.
 Proxy
 reform
 which


is
 the
 the
 process
 of
 voting
 for
 its


different
 proposals
 and
 really
 really


frankly
 rethinking
 the
 entire
 proxy


process.
 Um
 and
 then
 thirdly
 on


litigation
 reform
 and
 other
 things
 that


really
 keep
 companies
 from
 actually


maximizing
 returns
 for
 their


shareholders.
 So
 what
 our
 view
 is
 that


if
 we
 can
 make
 progress
 on
 those
 three


things,
 it
 will
 change
 the
 u
 what
 being


public
 means
 and
 it
 gives
 us
 an


opportunity
 to
 get
 more
 companies
 into


the
 public
 markets
 because
 as
 you
 say


that
 gives
 uh
 access
 for
 the
 retail


investors
 for
 the
 average
 investor
 to
 to


actually
 take
 part
 in
 that
 value


creation.
 So
 with
 with
 companies
 staying


private
 for
 longer,
 uh
 are
 you
 concerned


about
 the
 um
 abilities
 for
 the
 general


public
 to
 take
 part
 in
 that
 value


creation?
 And
 um
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 major


issue.
 I
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 recognize


that
 um
 really
 56%
 of
 American
 adults


own
 equities
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Um


but
 but
 only,
 you
 know,
 a
 very
 small


fraction
 of
 them
 have
 access
 to
 private


private
 investments.
 And
 you
 could
 say,


well,
 should
 you
 make
 private


investments
 more
 accessible?
 I
 think


there
 are
 ways
 to
 do
 that,
 but
 the
 the


real
 strength
 of
 the
 economy
 is
 in
 those


public
 markets
 where
 you
 get
 the
 the


broad-based
 citizen
 involved
 in
 driving


the
 growth
 of
 the
 economy
 and
 and


frankly,
 they
 benefit
 when
 the
 economy


benefits.
 That's
 what
 really
 creates
 a


virtuous
 cycle
 and
 we're
 we
 want
 to
 be


stewards
 of
 that.
 Um,
 and
 so
 we're


hoping
 to
 get
 some
 reform
 done
 there.
 I


think
 that's
 a
 great
 point
 to
 end
 them.


So,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 all
 your


insights
 and
 um
 thank
 you.
 Thank
 you


very
 much,
 Min.


To
 add
 more
 flavor
 to
 this
 investor


perspective,
 I'd
 like
 to
 invite
 our
 next


speaker.
 Christopher
 Horn
 is
 the
 founder


and
 portfolio
 manager
 of
 the
 Children's


Investment
 Fund
 Management,
 a
 hedge
 fund


known
 for
 its
 valuebased
 approach
 and


active
 engagement
 strategy.


Named
 as
 one
 of
 Time
 magazine's
 hundred


most
 influential
 people
 and
 hedge
 fund


manager
 of
 the
 year
 in
 2007,
 he
 was


knited
 in
 2014
 for
 his
 contributions
 to


philanthropy
 and
 international


development.
 Nikolai
 thinks
 he's
 the


best
 investor
 Europe
 has


seen.
 Today
 he'll
 be
 joined
 by
 Daniel


Baltaser,
 NB's
 co-chief
 investment


officer,
 active
 strategies
 for
 a


fireside
 chat.
 Please
 join
 me
 in


welcoming
 them
 to
 the


[Applause]


stage.
 Welcome


everyone.
 We
 are
 privileged
 to
 be
 joined


by
 two
 truly
 great
 investors
 today.
 I'll


start
 the
 conversation
 with
 Sir
 Chris


Horn
 and
 who
 will
 later
 then
 be
 joined


by
 Christian
 Syninding,
 CEO
 of


EQT.
 Chris,
 it's
 a
 privilege
 and
 honor


to
 have
 you.
 Welcome.
 I
 have
 to
 say
 I


completely
 agree
 with
 Nikolai,
 probably


the
 best
 investor
 Europe
 has
 ever
 seen.


To
 back
 it
 up
 with
 numbers,
 9%
 returns


above
 the
 market
 every
 single
 year
 over


a
 period
 of
 21
 years.
 Wow.
 On
 on


average.
 Not
 not
 not
 every
 single
 year


but
 on
 average.
 On


average.
 So
 share
 your
 secret
 with
 us.


Well


um


strategy
 has
 been
 to
 invest
 in
 great


companies.
 Um


um


but
 over
 time
 I've
 come


to
 refine
 and
 understand
 better
 what


what
 that
 means.
 and
 a
 lot
 of


uh
 um
 but
 that's
 just
 point
 one
 find
 the


great


companies
 point
 two


is
 being


concentrated
 as


um
 um
 George
 Soros
 uh
 said
 once
 it


doesn't
 matter
 if
 you're
 right
 or
 wrong


all
 that
 matters
 is
 how
 big
 you
 are
 your


position
 size
 when
 you're
 right
 and
 and


and
 your
 position
 size
 when
 you're


Yeah,
 if
 I'm
 right
 on
 a
 1%
 position,
 it


kind
 of
 doesn't
 make
 any
 difference.
 So,


we'll
 take
 positions
 of
 10
 to
 15%
 in
 the


past,
 even
 25%
 of
 the
 fund.
 And
 that's
 a


double-edged
 sword.
 If
 you're
 right,


it's
 it's
 it's
 fantastic.
 If
 you're


wrong,
 it's
 uh
 very
 painful.
 So,


concentration
 is
 an
 important
 uh
 facet.


um
 because
 there
 aren't
 hundreds
 of
 of


of of
 uh
 of
 great
 ideas
 and
 um
 and
 and


companies


and
 you
 might
 say
 that
 sounds


risky
 then
 it
 is
 and
 uh
 and
 then
 I
 would


uh
 look
 at


um
 I
 ask
 you
 well
 what
 how
 do
 you
 define


risk
 and
 the
 best
 definition
 of
 that
 was


for
 me
 given
 by
 Warren
 Buffett
 who
 we


all
 love
 and
 he
 defined
 risk
 as
 not


knowing
 what
 you're


Now
 the
 uh
 um
 a
 lot
 of
 investors
 and


then
 the
 third
 component
 I
 would
 say
 is


long-
 termism.
 Mhm.
 Yeah.
 You
 can
 be
 you


can
 find
 a
 great
 company
 but
 if
 your


time
 horizon


is
 you
 know
 very
 short
 you're
 you
 had


the
 vagaries
 of
 of
 what
 Kane's
 called


the
 voting
 machine.
 He
 said
 in
 the
 short


term
 the
 market
 is
 a
 a
 voting
 machine


and
 only
 in
 the
 long
 term
 is
 it
 a


weighing
 machine
 and
 um
 going
 back
 to


Warren
 Buffett
 he
 was
 asked
 was


Coca-Cola
 a
 risky
 investment
 when
 he


first
 made
 it
 and
 he
 said
 depend
 on
 on


the
 time
 horizon
 over
 one
 year
 one
 month


very
 risky
 he
 couldn't
 sell
 where
 the


price
 would
 trade
 at
 in
 in
 it
 um
 it


doesn't
 necessarily
 reflect
 fundamentals


uh
 in
 any
 short
 or
 even
 medium
 term
 And


so
 I
 do
 think
 time
 horizon
 is


um
 a
 critical
 thing
 and
 even
 intelligent


investors
 are
 are
 unable
 or
 unwilling
 to


to
 to


uh
 have
 a
 a
 long-term
 horizon
 and
 so
 and


I
 would
 put
 engagement
 as
 another


component
 o
 of
 that
 for
 us
 of
 adding


value.
 So
 those
 uh
 and
 so
 we
 we we


um
 so
 find
 the
 great


companies
 focused
 or
 concentrated


portfolio


long-termism
 and
 engagement
 act
 as
 an


owner
 in
 simple
 terms.
 Um
 but
 you
 know
 a


lot
 of
 investors
 get
 confused
 that
 the


thing
 that
 you
 want
 is
 growth.
 Yeah.


Yeah.
 You
 know,
 a


and
 if
 you
 look
 at
 industries
 like


airlines,
 they've
 been
 growing
 for
 100


years,
 maybe
 5%
 a
 year,
 you
 know,


fantastic
 growth,
 but
 collectively
 and


cumulatively,
 the
 industry
 never
 made


any
 money
 because
 competition
 was
 too


strong.
 And
 so


growth
 per
 se,
 growth
 by
 itself
 is
 is


not
 a


um


a
 a
 guarantee
 of
 of
 of
 making
 money.
 Um


so
 you
 need


um
 critically
 barriers
 to
 entry
 to


competition


and
 sustainable
 value
 ad
 and
 high
 value


ad.
 So
 that
 um
 so
 it's
 actually
 a


combination
 of
 barriers
 to
 entry
 and
 and


and
 um
 high
 value
 added
 um
 that
 you
 you


can
 charge
 for
 and
 uh
 and
 of
 course
 then


growth
 has
 a
 value.
 Um
 but
 the
 but
 so


everybody
 would
 agree
 with
 those


statements
 but
 the
 the
 interesting
 thing


is


uh


um
 going
 back
 again
 third
 time
 to
 Warren


Buffett
 he
 said
 most
 moes
 aren't
 worth
 a


dam
 because
 you
 think
 you've
 got
 a
 moat


but
 and
 then
 it
 erodess


and
 so
 the
 real
 thing
 is
 sustainability


of
 moes
 you
 know
 so
 how
 do
 you
 find
 out


whether
 a
 great
 company
 remains
 a
 great


company
 over
 time


Yeah.
 Well,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 is
 to


understand
 the
 um
 so
 you


know
 the
 forces
 of
 competition
 and
 and


substitution
 and
 disruption
 are
 are
 very


powerful
 and
 and
 we've
 learned
 just
 as


in
 the
 same
 way
 people
 underestimate


complexity


structurally,
 most
 investors


underestimate
 the
 forces
 of
 competition


and
 disruption.
 Why?
 because
 they're


short-term.
 Mhm.
 Keeps
 going
 back
 to
 the


same
 root
 causes
 and


um
 we're
 um
 um


so
 we
 learn
 through
 examples
 and
 uh
 uh


through
 sometimes
 experience
 and


suffering.
 Um,
 one
 of
 my
 investments
 30


years
 ago
 when
 before
 I
 started
 TCI
 was


with
 a
 European
 media
 company
 that


um,
 Bane
 Capital
 had
 bought
 control
 of


and
 uh,
 uh,
 it
 was
 a
 monopoly
 and
 uh,


they
 boughted
 control.
 It
 was
 like
 a


billion
 euro
 valuation
 and


uh


um
 and
 the
 stock
 went
 to
 a
 50
 billion


valuation
 1
 billion
 to
 50
 billion
 and


then
 it
 went
 to
 zero
 and
 it
 was
 a
 a


yellow
 pages
 company
 in
 Italy
 because


the
 internet
 hadn't
 been
 found.
 It
 was


people
 thought
 it
 was
 a
 resilient


monopoly


but
 you
 know
 something
 Google
 destroyed


the
 company.


So


we
 we
 sometimes
 don't
 know.
 Yeah,
 we


can't
 know
 what
 hasn't
 been
 invented.
 So


then
 how
 can
 you
 know
 anything?
 You


might
 say,


yeah,
 was


uh
 training
 said,
 "Yeah,
 unknown,


unknown."
 So
 you
 know
 the
 you
 don't
 know


what
 you
 don't
 know.
 But
 uh
 the


um


so
 but
 certain
 industries
 are
 more
 prone


to
 disruption
 than
 others.
 your
 risk
 is


much


higher
 and
 uh
 and


so
 we
 try
 to
 avoid
 those
 those
 sectors


because
 you're
 asking
 for
 trouble
 or


limit
 our


exposure
 and


um
 one
 of
 those
 sectors
 uh
 is


technology.
 Yeah.
 So
 what
 are
 the
 ones


you
 like?
 I've
 always
 liked
 as
 one


example
 infrastructure.
 Mhm.
 where
 there


are
 which
 is
 bit
 unusual
 you
 know


um
 it's
 not
 that
 sexy
 it's
 a
 bit
 boring


owning
 toll
 roads
 and
 airports
 and


transmission
 lines


um
 cell
 phone
 towers
 and
 uh
 but
 I


um
 I


I
 was
 born
 into
 a
 poor
 family
 and
 uh
 so


I


always
 wanted
 to
 get
 my
 capital


back.
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 a
 good
 starting


point.
 Don't
 lose
 your
 capital.
 And
 so
 I


I
 sort
 of
 believed
 in
 physical
 asset


backing.
 Yeah.
 Which
 most
 investors


don't
 look
 at
 tangible
 book
 value.


That's


something
 you
 know
 forgotten
 in
 economic


textbooks
 as
 a
 as
 a
 as
 a
 as
 a
 metric
 but


or
 a
 placement
 value.
 But


um
 you
 know
 an


example
 is
 uh
 maybe
 10
 years
 ago,
 nine


years
 ago


um
 um
 the
 Spanish
 government
 approached


us
 and
 and
 about
 taking
 an
 anchor


position
 in
 an
 IPO
 of
 their
 airport
 Aena


and


uh


um
 airport
 was
 basically
 brand
 new,
 huge


under
 capacity


um
 and
 75%
 of
 the
 the
 the
 value
 was
 in


unregulated
 shops
 and
 car
 parks
 and
 uh


you
 know
 complete
 monopoly
 unregulated


and
 uh
 huge
 growth
 potential
 and
 they


sold
 it
 at
 a
 15%
 free
 cash
 flow
 yield


and


uh
 and
 what
 we
 could
 see
 is
 that
 you


could
 never
 replace
 these
 assets
 Madrid


airport
 and
 Barcelona
 airport
 and


irreplaceable
 and


um
 and
 they
 sold
 at
 the
 right
 price.


Valuation
 matters.
 they
 sold
 it
 at
 15%


free
 cash
 flow
 yield.


Um
 and
 um
 so
 I
 learned
 I
 learned
 at


school
 that
 a
 great
 company
 is
 not


necessarily
 a
 great
 investment
 but
 you


look
 at
 something
 like
 cash
 flow
 yield


to
 tell
 you
 now
 it's
 a
 good
 time
 to
 buy


and
 sometimes
 people
 say
 it's
 things
 are


cheap
 for
 a
 reason.
 Mhm.
 Now
 people
 were


concerned
 about
 government
 ownership
 in


this
 case
 regulation
 and


um
 and
 the
 government
 did
 uh
 impact
 it.


They
 limited
 the
 compensation
 of
 the
 CEO


to


€200,000
 and
 ultimately
 the
 CEO
 left.
 He


was
 a
 very
 good
 CEO,
 the
 original.
 And


so


um
 but
 I
 it
 didn't
 matter
 because
 the


monopoly
 was
 there,
 the
 assets
 were


there.
 So
 I
 like
 asset
 backing
 um
 of


infrastructure.
 Another
 sector
 that


we've


Can
 I
 just
 ask
 you
 one
 question
 on
 this?


If
 you
 like
 an
 asset,
 a
 physical
 asset,


does
 management
 quality
 matter?
 Is
 it


important?
 Less
 so.
 Mhm.
 It
 matters
 for


reinvestment


risk.


And
 but
 one
 of
 the
 things
 um
 I
 mentioned


that


we
 do
 is
 we're
 actor
 as
 owners.
 We
 have


people
 have


different
 terms
 for
 that
 constructivist


and
 activist
 but
 I
 really
 think


fundamentally
 he's
 acting
 as
 an
 owner


and
 in
 the
 case


of
 and
 and
 we
 were
 worried
 we
 didn't


have
 any
 control
 and
 um
 but
 we
 had


influence
 I
 I
 I


I
 was
 asked
 to
 be
 on
 the
 board.
 I
 was
 on


the
 board
 for
 three
 years
 of
 the
 Vehina,


the
 airport
 company,
 and
 we
 went
 to
 the


government
 and
 to
 the
 board
 and
 and
 and


said,
 "Look,
 you're
 throwing
 out
 all


this
 cash
 flow,
 billions
 of
 euros
 of


cash.
 You
 don't
 need
 it.
 We
 want
 to


propose
 an
 80%
 dividend
 payout


ratio."
 And
 for
 you,
 that's
 dividends


you
 can
 spend.
 And
 and and
 they
 agreed


to
 it.
 And
 so
 my
 reinvestment
 risk
 of


management
 was
 limited
 then,
 very


limited.
 and
 uh
 and
 so
 there
 are
 things


you
 can
 do
 if
 uh
 to
 mitigate
 risk.
 Mhm.


Um


and
 but
 it
 does
 matter.
 You
 know,


another
 infrastructure
 asset


uh
 we've
 been
 invested
 in
 is
 is
 in
 the


toll
 road
 sector
 for
 OVL.
 It's
 where


there's
 a
 family
 that
 have
 about
 a


quarter
 of
 the
 stake
 and
 they're


fantastic
 capital
 allocators.
 They
 just


reinvest.
 They
 sold
 Heathrow
 airport


recently
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 at
 a
 low
 return


and
 they
 reinvesting
 in
 Monopoly
 toll


roads
 at
 high
 returns
 and
 they
 just


really
 know
 their
 business
 and
 uh
 have


high
 alignment
 of
 interest.
 So
 um
 but


you
 know
 again
 Buffett
 said
 you've
 got


to
 in
 ideally
 you
 should
 invest
 in
 an


industry


where
 a
 monkey
 could
 run
 it
 because
 one


day
 they
 will.
 Mhm.


And
 so,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 I
 I
 want
 to
 find


an
 asset
 where
 because,
 you
 know,


there's
 no
 guarantee
 the
 CEO's
 comes


back.
 Yeah.
 Yep.
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 you


have
 to
 invest
 in
 an
 in
 a
 business
 where


it's
 a
 great
 business
 and
 uh
 it
 doesn't


depend
 on
 the
 manager.
 Um
 because


there's
 no,
 you
 know,
 the
 assets
 are


ultimately
 more
 reliable
 than
 the
 than


the
 manager.
 So
 um
 but
 you
 know
 so
 in
 in


this
 sort
 of
 where
 are
 the
 moes
 you
 we


talked
 about
 infrastructure
 and
 physical


non-replicable
 assets
 another
 space
 we


like
 as
 an
 example
 is


aerospace
 things
 like
 aircraft
 engines


and
 um
 manufacturers
 like
 G
 aerospace


and
 saffron
 and
 we
 like
 that
 space


because
 the
 barriers
 to
 entry
 are


extremely
 high


um
 in
 terms
 of
 intellectual
 property


the
 the
 it's
 so
 complicated
 to
 make
 this


product
 that
 there
 have
 been
 no
 new


entrance
 for
 50
 years.
 Yeah.
 So
 new


entrance
 is
 a
 sign
 of
 uh
 the
 barriers
 to


entry.
 It's
 one
 of
 the
 the
 uh
 the


criteria
 you
 can
 look
 at.
 Um
 so
 um
 and


um
 the
 uh
 and
 why
 is
 that?
 Not
 only
 is


it
 very
 complicated


um
 you
 make
 the
 money
 in
 the
 spare


parts.
 So
 once
 you've
 got
 this
 installed


base,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 the
 the
 new


engines
 are
 only
 a
 small
 percentage
 and


the
 airframers
 only
 want
 one
 or
 two


engines.
 It's
 too
 complicated
 otherwise


who
 there
 isn't
 the
 room
 for
 for for


multiple
 competitors.
 Mhm.
 Uh
 and
 so
 um


and


then
 for
 various
 reasons
 uh
 that
 uh
 it's


very
 difficult
 for
 competitors
 to
 enter


the
 the
 replacement
 parts
 and
 so
 the


switching
 costs.
 Yeah.
 So
 that's
 another


uh
 space
 where
 very
 intellectual


property
 is
 uh
 can
 be
 of
 a
 barrier.


Fascinating.
 And
 now
 I'd
 like
 to
 invite


Christian
 Syninding,
 CEO
 of
 EQT
 to
 join


us.
 Under
 his
 leadership,
 EQT
 has


quadrupled
 in
 size,
 became
 Sweden's


fourth
 largest
 listed
 company
 and
 a


leading
 forwardinking
 organization
 in


private
 markets.
 Welcome
 Christian.


Thank
 you.
 Thank


you
 to
 be
 here.


So
 Christian,
 what
 defines
 a
 truly
 great


company
 for
 EQT?


It's
 the
 favorite
 question
 uh
 of
 the


year,
 I
 would
 say.
 uh
 so
 interesting


actually
 that
 I
 did
 a
 poll
 of
 uh
 of
 my


colleagues
 uh
 the
 that
 call
 it
 the
 top


investors
 at
 EQT
 and
 um
 and
 it
 came
 out


very
 consistently
 actually
 into
 three


three
 different
 categories.
 Um
 the
 first


one
 has
 to
 do
 with
 the
 industry
 or
 the


sector
 that
 the
 the
 company
 is
 in.
 And


uh
 what
 we've
 sharpened
 over
 time
 is
 is


to
 find
 long-term
 themes
 in
 society
 that


are
 not
 dependent
 necessarily
 on
 the


economic
 activity
 but
 on
 some
 other


drivers
 like
 digitalization
 of
 society,


decarbonization
 of
 society,
 aging


society,
 those
 kinds
 of
 broad
 themes


that
 are
 uh
 you
 know
 going
 to
 run
 for
 a


long
 long
 time.
 Uh
 behind
 that


infrastructure
 actually
 is
 spot
 on
 in


there.


Um
 then
 you
 go
 to
 the
 company
 uh
 and


we're
 looking
 for
 companies
 that
 have
 a


great
 business
 model
 uh
 recurring


revenues
 in
 some
 form
 some
 kind
 of


competitive
 moat
 if
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it


that
 to
 use
 your
 language
 um
 competitive


advantage
 uh
 and
 something
 you
 can


continue
 to
 build
 on
 um
 that
 has
 lots
 of


opportunities
 to
 grow
 both
 organically


through
 acquisitions
 and
 change.
 So


that's
 kind
 of
 category
 number
 one.


Category
 category
 number
 two
 is


um


leadership.
 So
 a
 couple
 of
 colleagues


said
 CEO
 CEO
 CEO


and
 um
 and
 of
 course
 we
 own
 the


companies,
 we
 control
 the
 company.
 So
 we


can
 install
 the
 board,
 we
 can
 install
 uh


the
 management
 if
 if
 it
 doesn't
 already


have
 a
 great
 one.
 But
 I
 think
 it's


broader
 than
 CEO.
 I
 think
 it's
 the


leadership
 group.
 It's
 the
 uh
 it's
 the


organizational
 design
 of
 the
 company.


It's
 a
 cultural
 health.
 We
 we
 heard
 a


lot
 about
 these
 things
 earlier
 today.


um
 you
 know
 culture
 beats
 strategy
 for


breakfast
 as
 they
 say
 and
 I
 think
 we


heard
 that
 from
 David
 and
 others
 uh
 very


much
 true
 for
 EQT
 uh
 so
 that's
 kind
 of


that's
 category
 number
 two
 maybe
 also


ability
 to
 attract
 and
 retain
 talent


very
 important
 category
 three
 is
 we
 also


heard
 about
 from
 Otis
 and
 others
 um
 and


even
 over
 Nordisk
 it's
 actually
 the


ability
 to
 take
 you
 know
 the
 position


that
 you're
 in
 the
 strategies
 that
 you


have
 the
 leadership
 group
 that
 you
 have


and
 execute
 relentlessly


um
 and
 drive,
 you
 know,
 a
 culture
 of


continuous
 improvement.
 So,
 it's
 not


good
 enough
 just
 to
 be
 a
 visionary,


great
 CEO
 or
 have
 a
 great
 team.
 You
 also


actually,
 you
 know,
 to
 drive
 execution


every
 single
 day.
 Um
 and
 if
 you
 think


about
 the
 four
 companies
 that
 we
 heard


about
 this
 morning,
 uh
 you
 find
 those


themes
 across
 all
 of
 them
 in
 in
 various


forms,
 right?
 Yeah.
 It
 sounds
 like
 they


put
 a
 bit
 more
 emphasis
 on
 leadership


than
 Chris
 does
 in
 his
 approach.


What
 are
 you
 looking
 for
 in
 a
 CEO
 and
 in


the
 leadership
 team?
 Uh
 I'm
 looking
 for


someone
 who
 has
 a
 vision.
 Doesn't
 have


to
 be
 vision
 area,
 but
 someone
 who
 has
 a


real
 vision.
 Where
 are
 we
 taking
 the


company
 and
 why?
 Um
 someone
 who
 can


bring
 people
 together
 uh
 who
 can
 inspire


uh
 but
 also
 be
 sharp
 enough
 to
 execute.


So
 combining
 those
 two
 elements
 I
 just


talked
 about
 um
 I
 think
 uh
 the
 ability


also
 to
 to
 change
 your
 mind
 if
 a
 better


argument
 comes
 uh
 and
 have
 this
 mindset


you
 talked
 a
 little
 bit
 earlier
 about


how
 do
 you
 deal
 with
 technological


change
 and
 threats
 um
 and
 to
 have
 the


mindset
 of
 we
 we
 call
 it
 a
 future


proofing
 what
 does
 the
 company
 need
 to


stay
 ahead
 of
 the
 curve
 what
 threats
 are


coming
 what
 opportunities
 are
 coming


right
 now
 it's
 AI
 then
 it'll
 be
 AGI
 and


then
 maybe
 quantum
 computing
 whatever


all
 these
 things
 are
 impacting
 business,


sustainability,
 uh
 decarbonization,
 all


these,
 you
 know,
 how
 do
 you
 deal
 with


that?
 Do
 you
 wait
 to
 see
 what
 happens
 or


do
 you
 take
 the
 bull
 by
 the
 horns
 and


actually
 drive
 change?
 Mhm.
 Uh
 those
 are


some
 of
 the
 elements
 that
 we're
 looking


for.
 Um
 and
 then
 not
 complicating
 things


too
 much.
 Mhm.
 Sticking
 to
 what's


important.


Mhm.
 You
 mentioned
 long-term
 themes.


Chris,
 is
 this
 approach
 that
 Christian


takes
 on
 investing
 in
 long-term


structured
 themes
 something
 that


resonates
 with
 you?
 Yeah.
 The
 the


average
 life
 of
 a
 of
 a
 holding
 of
 our


current
 portfolio
 is
 80
 years.
 Mhm.
 Now,


the
 average
 holding
 for
 a
 of
 a
 US
 stock


is
 less
 than
 one
 year.


So
 investors
 are


absolutely
 on
 mass
 short-term


um
 trading
 oriented


and
 so


why
 you


know
 it
 it
 but
 we
 should
 ask
 well
 why
 is


long-termism
 is
 it
 a
 good
 strategy?


Yeah.
 Is
 it
 why
 and
 why?
 I'd
 like
 to


think
 it
 is.
 Yeah.
 Well
 we
 should
 ask


the
 question
 why.
 I
 always
 say
 justify.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And


if
 you
 look


empirically,
 it
 turns
 out
 that
 the
 very


best
 companies,
 high


rises,


they
 they
 stay
 good.
 They
 don't


disappear
 o
 overnight
 generally.
 Yep.


And
 bad
 companies
 stay
 bad.
 Lower
 stay


low.
 I
 totally
 agree.
 We
 have
 an


expression.
 Good
 companies
 are
 better


than
 they
 seem.
 Bad
 companies
 are
 worse


than
 they
 seem.
 There's
 persistency.


It's
 better.
 You
 got
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 the


bad
 ones
 and
 just
 double
 down
 on
 the


good
 ones.
 Yeah,
 there's
 persistency


and
 and
 the
 value
 of
 that
 company
 is


only
 seen
 over
 the
 long
 term.
 So
 you
 get


they
 say
 there's
 no
 free
 lunch
 in


finance,
 but
 actually
 I
 do
 think


long-termism
 in
 a
 great
 company
 is
 a


free
 lunch
 because
 the
 the
 if
 you
 look


at
 any
 sellside
 model,
 they'll
 go
 out


three
 years
 if
 if
 or
 or
 or
 two


years.
 And
 that's
 why
 because
 that's
 the


time
 horizon
 of
 the
 typical
 buy
 side


investor.
 One,
 two,
 or
 three,
 one
 or
 two


years.
 But
 what
 if
 it
 can
 keep
 being


good
 for
 30
 years?
 Then
 you're


completely
 undervaluing
 that
 company.


We,
 you
 know,
 we
 um


and
 and
 people
 don't
 look
 at
 it
 because


there
 aren't
 most
 companies
 95%
 of


mediocre
 or
 bad
 companies.
 Yeah.
 And


they
 meet
 their
 cost
 of
 capital,
 but


they're
 not
 super
 companies.


you
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 companies
 I


mentioned,
 aerospace,
 we
 invested
 in


Saffron.
 We've
 owned
 it
 for
 13
 years


now
 and
 in
 in
 in
 we're
 actually
 one
 of


the
 largest
 investors
 in
 the
 company
 and


uh
 um


and
 we
 made
 around
 more
 than
 a
 20%
 IR


for
 13
 years.
 It's
 a
 long
 period
 that


duration.
 Very
 long.
 Yeah.
 Very
 long


period.
 What
 company
 was
 that?
 Saffron.


Mhm.
 Yeah.
 They're
 a
 joint
 venture
 with


G
 Aerospace
 in
 aircraft
 engines


and


um
 and
 so


um
 we
 have
 investors
 who
 come
 in
 and
 say


well
 we
 want
 new
 things.
 Yeah.
 Why
 is
 it


so
 hard
 for
 investors
 to
 be
 long-term?
 I


understand
 they're
 commercial
 pressures


but
 there
 must
 be
 they
 think
 new
 is


better.
 I
 think
 you
 volatility.
 Yeah.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 You
 know
 the
 one
 of
 the


Yeah.
 I'm
 obviously
 interested
 in
 the


private
 markets.
 One
 of
 the
 benefits
 of


the
 private
 market
 is
 you're
 kind
 of


forced
 to
 invest
 for
 the
 long
 term.
 We


own
 companies.
 We
 own
 them
 for
 5
 to
 10


years
 at
 a
 time.
 Now,
 we're
 actually


starting
 to
 own
 them
 for
 longer
 because


we
 realize
 that
 winners
 need
 to
 be
 owned


longer
 to
 really
 uh
 get
 the
 maximum


value
 creation
 out
 of
 them
 as
 well.
 Um


but
 but
 you're
 kind
 of
 forced
 to
 invest


for
 the
 long
 term
 and
 and
 even
 in
 these


products
 that
 now
 individuals
 can
 invest


in
 in
 our
 industry
 uh
 they're
 also
 very


long-term
 in
 their
 nature
 and
 um
 you


know
 our
 valuations
 aren't
 as
 volatile.


You
 can
 discuss
 why
 but
 uh
 but
 it
 is


because
 that
 we're
 not
 that
 interested


in
 what
 it's
 worth
 right
 now.
 We're


interested
 in
 what
 the
 companies
 are


worth.
 You
 know
 when
 we
 buy
 a
 company


we're
 interested
 in
 what
 it's
 worth
 in


five
 years
 or
 in
 seven
 years
 and
 what
 we


can
 do
 with
 that
 business
 in
 the


meantime.
 Yeah.
 And
 in
 the
 extreme,
 we


don't
 even
 care
 what
 it
 costs
 so
 much


today.
 As
 long
 as
 we
 know
 that
 we
 can


take
 it
 to
 here
 or
 we're
 highly


confident
 we
 can
 do
 that
 with
 time.


That's
 that's
 actually
 more
 important


than
 what
 we
 pay
 100
 or
 110
 today.


Doesn't
 really
 matter
 if
 you
 create
 four


or
 five
 or
 600
 up
 here
 later.
 So
 how
 do


you
 do
 that?
 You
 identify
 a
 company
 that


you
 want
 to
 buy.
 Y
 pay
 a
 price
 that


you're
 happy
 to
 pay.
 Yeah.
 And
 then


what's
 the
 playbook
 to
 create
 the
 value?


Well,
 the
 the
 playbook
 that
 we're
 trying


to
 industrialize
 is
 is
 we
 create
 a
 full


potential
 plan
 for
 the
 business.
 We
 kind


of
 dream
 say
 if
 this
 company
 had
 every


resource
 in
 the
 world
 uh
 to
 be
 able
 to


grow
 develop
 and
 go
 to
 the
 next
 level
 uh


h
 how
 what
 could
 it
 look
 like
 you
 know


if
 you
 did
 all
 the
 M&A
 you
 wanted
 to
 do


all
 the
 innovation
 uh
 you
 get
 rid
 of
 the


things
 that
 aren't
 working
 upgrade
 the


organization
 improve
 the
 margins
 all


that
 kind
 of
 stuff
 um
 okay
 so
 that's
 the


full
 potential
 uh
 what
 can
 we
 actually


get
 done
 in
 in
 a
 reasonable
 time
 period


with
 the
 people
 that
 we
 have
 involved


either
 globally
 or
 in
 the
 company
 or


whatever
 um
 we
 bring
 lots
 of
 resources


it
 for
 the
 company
 whether
 it's


governance
 or
 IT
 skills
 or
 AI
 skills
 or


sustainability
 skills
 or
 expansion
 or


M&A
 whatever
 the
 company
 needs
 we
 try
 to


bring
 those
 resources
 in
 uh
 and
 and
 then


we
 push
 the
 gas
 pedal
 pretty
 hard
 and


and
 and
 we
 go
 for
 it
 and
 we
 very
 often


don't
 meet
 the
 full
 potential
 plan
 but


that
 kind
 of
 mindset
 helps
 you
 drive
 the


company
 forward
 um
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 really


and
 also
 really
 deciding
 which
 are
 the


big
 things
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 Nova


Nordics
 Nord
 Nordics
 we
 heard
 earlier
 um


what
 are
 the
 big
 initiatives
 that
 can


really
 make
 a
 difference
 and
 then
 making


sure
 that
 you
 put
 the
 best
 people
 behind


that
 enough
 capital
 behind
 it
 and
 those


things
 that's
 that's
 what
 we
 can
 do
 in


the
 in
 the
 private
 markets
 and
 it's
 a


lot
 of
 fun
 what
 can
 you
 do
 in
 the
 public


market
 as
 an
 activist
 and
 your
 approach


has
 evolved
 a
 little
 bit
 over
 time
 yeah


it's
 an
 interesting
 debate
 private


versus
 public


um
 and


you
 know
 what,
 um


um


because
 I
 do
 think
 the
 very
 best


companies
 in
 the
 world
 are
 public


companies.
 Mhm.
 Um
 not
 everyone
 but


generally
 and
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 is


um
 in
 many
 industries
 scale
 and
 scope


matter.
 Small
 is
 not
 beautiful.


Um
 a
 and


um
 you
 you
 you


um


um
 an
 example
 of
 this
 is


uh


um
 video
 conferencing
 where
 Zoom
 new


innovator


brought
 out
 video
 conferencing
 and


Microsoft
 launched
 teams
 and
 just


distributed
 a
 free
 integrated
 in
 in
 in


their
 bundled
 office
 product.
 Now
 people


say
 Zoom
 was
 a
 better
 product,
 but


Microsoft
 won
 because
 they
 had
 this


bundling
 strategy
 and
 they
 had
 scope.


They
 had,
 you
 know,
 advantages
 of
 scope


and
 and
 Yeah.
 and
 and and
 and
 uh
 the


ability,
 you
 know,
 customer


relationships
 and
 and and
 so
 I
 think


people
 underestimate
 sometimes
 these


powers
 of
 big
 companies
 of
 incumbency
 to


uh
 crush
 a
 competitor
 and
 and
 uh


so
 I
 um


um
 the
 but
 the
 a
 public
 market
 investor


doesn't
 have
 no


influence.
 Okay?
 if
 they're


willing,
 they
 can
 uh
 they
 can
 influence


and
 sometimes


um
 stopping
 stupid


things
 a
 and
 an
 example
 of
 saffron
 you


know
 we
 had
 this
 great


company
 reported
 eight
 times
 earnings
 it


was
 compounding
 at
 20%
 and
 then
 one
 day


they
 came
 out
 and
 tried
 to
 make
 an


incredibly
 stupid
 acquisition
 of
 a


company
 called
 Zodiac


a
 wild
 overvaluation
 using
 shares
 which


were
 half
 their
 intrinsic
 value.
 So
 it


was
 doubly


bad.
 Um
 and
 we
 fought
 the
 deal
 and
 in


the
 end
 they
 cut
 the
 price
 in
 half
 and


then
 paid
 only
 in


cash


and
 the
 share
 price
 doubled.
 You
 know
 we


got
 sued
 by
 the
 seller.
 I
 was
 sued


personally
 for
 hund00
 million
 euros
 and


the
 uh
 my


CFO
 came
 to
 me
 very
 stressed
 one
 night


saying
 it's
 all
 right
 for
 you.
 You
 can


afford
 it


but
 they're
 going
 to
 bankrupt
 me
 and
 um


because
 the
 seller
 lost
 a
 billion
 euros


and
 uh
 and
 but
 few
 investors
 will
 act


like
 that.
 Mhm.
 Yeah.
 Most
 just
 accept


it.
 But
 in
 the
 end
 they
 they
 they
 they


cut
 the
 price
 and
 blamed
 us
 which
 was


fine.
 and
 uh
 and
 all's
 well
 that
 ends


well.
 They
 they they
 never
 did
 silly


things
 again.
 Um
 but
 but
 then
 you
 have


to
 jump
 in.
 You
 you
 have
 to
 have
 a
 big


enough
 ownership
 stake
 to
 to
 actually


have
 that
 influence,
 don't
 you?
 In
 some


form
 or
 at least
 a
 real
 voice
 that
 they


uh
 that
 they
 will
 listen
 to.
 Then
 the


challenge
 in
 the
 public
 markets,
 if
 I


may
 challenge
 that,
 is
 that
 often
 the


companies
 become
 run
 by
 the
 the


management,
 right?
 because
 they're


ultimately
 ones
 then
 with
 with
 no
 active


shareholders
 they
 effectively
 point
 the


board
 and
 you
 you
 have
 a
 bit
 of
 a


governance
 that's
 a
 big
 risk
 other
 side


of
 the
 coin
 it's
 a
 big
 risk
 and
 in


general
 well
 I
 would
 maybe
 the
 journal


is
 there
 are
 many
 companies
 with
 bad


governance
 that
 become
 badly
 run
 and
 I'm


you
 know
 I'm
 not
 a
 believer
 in
 being
 an


activist
 in
 a
 bad
 industry
 or
 bad


company
 that
 doesn't
 make
 any
 sense
 but


um
 and


So,
 but
 there
 is
 a
 I
 don't
 actually


think
 the


shareholding
 necessarily
 is
 everything


can
 matter.
 We
 we
 went
 recently
 on
 the


board
 of
 a
 company
 called
 Snell
 next


cell
 phone
 towers
 and
 we
 we
 had
 10%
 and


so
 it
 mattered
 because
 there
 were
 four


comp
 four
 shareholders
 with
 10%
 each
 and


so
 it
 was
 very
 concentrated
 but
 um
 I


think
 the
 power
 of
 the


argument
 can
 win
 you
 know
 shareholders


are
 not
 stupid
 you
 know
 bank
 is
 not


going
 to
 be
 an
 activist
 themselves
 but


if
 an
 activist
 makes
 a
 good
 case
 they'll


support
 them
 they'll
 listen
 yeah
 they'll


they'll
 support
 them
 whatever
 stake
 the


activist
 has
 1%
 2%
 it
 doesn't
 matter.
 So


I
 I
 And
 can
 we
 go
 back
 can
 we
 go back
 to


the
 this
 this
 statement
 that
 you
 had


that
 the
 best
 companies
 are
 public?


Um
 I
 don't
 really
 appreciate
 that
 one.


Uh
 so
 maybe
 I
 give
 some
 examples.
 You


know
 we
 but
 I
 do
 agree
 with
 you
 that


having
 companies
 that
 are
 uh
 you
 know


strong
 large
 winning
 beating
 the


competition
 whatever.
 Uh
 one
 is
 a
 very


interesting
 that
 we
 own
 which
 is
 the


world's
 largest
 private
 education


company.
 It's
 a
 $15
 billion
 company.


It's
 uh
 but
 it's
 only
 got
 5%
 market


share
 around
 the
 world,
 growing


organically
 through
 acquisitions,
 super


purpose-driven,
 doing
 very
 good
 for


society.
 Um
 and
 uh
 the
 competitors
 are,


you
 know,
 moms
 and
 pops
 all
 around
 the


world
 that
 don't
 have
 the
 resources
 to


invest
 in
 AI
 and
 the
 next
 generation
 of


education
 and
 stuff
 like
 that.
 Um
 that


is
 a
 brilliant
 uh
 company.
 We've


actually
 had
 it
 public
 twice,
 but
 the


public
 market
 didn't
 appreciate
 it.
 So,


we've
 taken
 it
 private
 twice
 and
 now


we're
 just
 going
 to
 keep
 it
 private


hopefully
 for
 as
 long
 as
 we
 can
 and
 just


build
 and
 build
 and
 build.
 So
 I
 think


the
 world
 is
 also
 changing
 because


private
 equity
 has
 gotten
 so
 large
 now


um
 and
 t
 and
 we
 can
 move
 companies
 into


longerterm
 ownership
 structures.
 So
 we


can
 actually
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 see


more
 and
 more
 of
 the
 best
 companies
 in


the
 world
 either
 stay
 private
 or
 go


private
 and
 and
 grow.
 Um
 and
 that's
 a


big
 difference
 and
 that's
 one
 of
 the


things
 we're
 seeing
 in
 the
 market
 while


you
 heard
 you
 know
 number
 of
 public


companies
 is
 shrinking
 a
 lot
 over
 time.


And
 you
 alluded
 to
 the
 importance
 of


control.
 You
 tried
 an
 approach,
 a


private
 equity
 approach
 in
 the
 listed


market
 with
 the
 EQT
 listed.
 I
 hope
 we


didn't
 have
 time
 for
 that
 one.


Some
 reflections
 on
 lessons
 learned.


Yeah,
 we
 did.
 We
 tried
 to
 start
 a
 mini


version
 of
 what
 you
 do
 and
 we
 failed


miserably
 actually.
 It
 um
 we
 you
 know


after
 we
 shut
 the
 fund
 down
 last
 year,


we
 we
 delivered
 back
 like
 90%
 of
 the


capital
 that
 was
 invested
 or
 something
 a


little
 bit
 worse
 than
 that.
 And
 uh


luckily
 it
 was
 very
 small
 and
 uh
 when
 we


realized
 we
 weren't
 good
 at
 it,
 we


actually
 did
 shut
 it
 down
 and
 uh
 focus


on
 what
 we're
 good
 at
 which
 is
 private


markets.
 Um
 I
 think
 we
 tried
 to
 apply


the
 models
 that
 you've
 heard
 me
 think


about
 here
 and
 talk
 about
 here
 uh
 in
 a


public
 setting
 where
 we
 didn't
 have
 we


didn't
 have
 the
 toolbox.
 We
 didn't
 have


the
 understanding
 of
 how
 to
 drive


influence.
 We
 thought
 we
 would
 have
 more


impact
 being
 who
 we
 are
 and
 uh
 it
 didn't


work.
 So,
 it's
 really
 about
 it's
 a
 it's


a
 lot
 a
 lot
 of
 learnings
 in
 there.
 Back


to
 really
 sticking
 to
 your
 guns
 and


doing
 what
 you
 do
 well
 and
 more
 of
 that.


There's
 like
 everything
 there's
 pros
 and


cons,
 arguments
 for
 and
 against,


but
 in
 private
 equity,
 you
 you you
 pay
 a


price
 for
 control.
 You
 pay
 a
 premium.


Yeah.
 Can
 be
 big.
 Mhm.


So,
 so
 you
 know
 every
 don't
 get
 me
 wrong


control
 has
 a
 high
 value
 has
 a
 value


let's
 say
 it
 has
 a
 value


but
 is
 it
 worth
 40%.
 Yeah.
 Or
 whatever


premium
 you
 have
 to
 pay
 in
 a
 competitive


auction.
 You
 know
 in
 public
 markets


there's
 an
 offer
 every
 day.
 Yep.
 You
 can


take
 it
 or
 leave
 it.
 and
 and and


so
 it's
 um
 um
 I
 think
 the
 the
 uh
 so
 I


just
 think
 that
 that
 point
 is
 relevant


entry
 price
 matters
 and
 yeah
 do
 you


think
 do
 you
 think
 liquidity
 is


overvalued
 in
 the
 markets


well
 the
 thing
 is
 why
 why
 do
 people
 need


liquidity
 as
 much
 as
 they
 think
 they
 do


all
 the
 time
 you
 can
 be
 wrong
 that's


something
 um
 I
 learned
 the
 yellow
 pages


example
 was
 Yeah.
 And
 if


you're
 and
 um


the
 if
 if
 you're
 wrong
 in
 private,


there's
 no
 way
 out.
 Yeah.
 In
 a
 short


term.
 And
 um
 if
 you're
 wrong
 in
 a


public,
 you
 have
 a
 chance
 to
 get
 out.


Yeah.
 You
 have
 a
 you
 have
 a
 a
 chance,


but
 you
 don't
 really
 have
 a
 chance
 to


repair
 and
 improve
 what
 you
 do
 in


private.
 Right.
 we
 can
 we
 can
 huddle


down,
 change
 the
 management,
 change
 the


board,
 divest
 underperforming


operations.
 So,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 just


a
 completely
 different
 mindset
 to
 to
 a


point.
 Yeah.
 There there's
 um
 we
 were


investors
 in
 cable.
 Yeah.
 In
 in
 the
 US


and
 yeah,
 we
 own
 a
 lot
 of
 cable
 charter


and
 uh
 communications
 and
 uh
 before
 that


Time
 Warner
 Cabled
 and
 and
 it
 it
 was
 a


great
 in
 investment
 for
 uh
 eight
 years.


We
 made
 I
 know
 five
 billion
 a
 P&L
 and
 I


know
 five
 times
 our
 money.
 But
 then
 the


industry
 started
 to
 deteriorate.
 It


became
 saturated
 and
 more
 competitive


and
 people
 started
 overbuilding
 private


equity.
 Yep.
 We
 bought
 we
 bought
 lots
 of


those
 companies.
 So
 it
 started
 over
 one


of
 our
 best
 sectors
 actually
 and


yeah
 I
 sold.
 Yeah
 because
 it
 it
 changed.


We
 were
 buying.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


Unfortunately
 we
 are
 in
 the
 end
 of
 the


session
 already.
 I
 would
 love
 to


continue
 for
 much
 longer.
 Chris,
 you


shared
 many
 of
 your
 secrets.
 You
 shared


more
 in
 a
 podcast
 that
 you
 recorded
 with


Nikolai
 which
 will
 be
 released
 on
 the


14th
 of
 May.
 So
 I
 encourage
 everyone
 to


listen
 to
 that
 one.
 We'll
 take
 a
 break


now.
 So
 please
 be
 back
 in
 this
 room
 at


15:25.
 But
 first
 and
 most
 importantly,
 a


big
 big
 thanks
 to
 both
 of
 you
 for


sharing
 your
 insights.
 Nice
 to
 meet
 you.


We
 now
 turn
 our
 attention
 to
 two
 crucial


aspects
 of
 great
 companies.
 Leadership


and
 corporate
 culture.
 For
 even
 if
 a


company
 has
 breakthrough
 products,


market
 dominance
 and
 strong
 financials.


Without
 excellent
 leadership
 and
 a


vibrant
 culture,
 even
 the
 most
 promising


company
 may
 falter.


What
 role
 do
 leaders
 play
 in
 exceptional


organizations?
 How
 does
 culture
 lead
 to


long-term
 success?
 To
 help
 us
 answer


these
 crucial
 questions,
 we'd
 like
 to


welcome
 back
 to
 the
 stage
 Dean
 Erica


James
 from
 the
 Wharton
 School.
 Erica,


the
 stage
 is
 yours.


[Applause]


[Music]


Think
 back
 to
 the
 year


1999


2000
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Something


very
 interesting
 was


happening.
 The
 dotcom
 bubble


burst.
 I
 was
 a
 young
 assistant
 professor


teaching
 at
 a
 business
 school.
 mainly


MBA
 students,
 many
 of
 whom
 were


expecting
 to
 enter
 a
 career
 into
 an


industry
 where
 they
 would
 get
 to
 explore


the
 role
 of
 technology
 and
 this
 new.com


universe.
 And
 all
 of
 that
 goes
 by
 the


wayside.


The
 following
 year,
 Enron


collapses
 and
 then
 you
 see
 a
 series
 of


CEOs
 trapesed
 across
 the
 news
 media,


either
 in
 handcuffs
 or
 headed
 to
 court


because
 there
 was
 just
 a
 collapse
 of
 the


business
 sector
 in
 the
 United


States.
 As
 a
 business
 school
 professor,


looking
 out
 at
 the
 scores
 of
 young


impressionable
 minds
 who
 all
 thought


they
 were
 going
 to
 enter
 this
 industry,


I
 was
 really
 grappling
 with
 what
 do
 I


say
 to
 these
 young
 people?
 How
 do
 I


convey
 that
 to
 them
 that
 business


actually
 is
 and
 can
 be
 a
 force
 for
 good


when
 everything
 they
 see
 is
 that


business
 is
 bad,
 that
 leadership
 is
 bad,


that
 something
 in
 the
 system
 is


broken.
 Well,
 fortunately
 for
 me,
 that


led
 to
 an
 interest
 in
 understanding


organizational
 crises,
 but
 not
 so
 much


because
 I
 was
 curious
 about
 what
 goes


wrong.
 I
 really
 wanted
 to
 answer
 the


question,
 how
 do
 those
 companies
 that


come
 out
 of
 organization
 that
 come
 out


of
 crisis,
 how
 do
 they
 do
 that?
 How
 do


they
 succeed?
 What
 are
 the
 leadership


characteristics
 that
 are
 necessary
 to


drive
 organizations
 through
 the
 most


tumultuous
 times?


So
 that
 led
 to
 decades
 of
 research
 for


me
 and
 studying
 organizational


leadership,
 organizational
 culture,


particularly
 in
 times
 of
 crisis.
 So
 I


want
 to
 share
 with
 you
 a
 little
 bit


about
 what
 I've
 learned.
 The
 first
 thing


I've
 learned
 is
 that
 we
 have
 to
 be


really
 clear
 about
 what
 we
 mean
 by
 a


crisis.
 Raise
 your
 hand
 if
 you
 have
 said


or
 have
 heard
 people
 say
 as
 they
 go
 into


the
 office,
 "Well,
 what
 crisis
 are
 we


managing
 today?
 Anyone
 hear
 that?
 Anyone


said


that?
 How
 many
 fires
 do
 we
 have
 to
 put


out
 this
 week?
 Right?
 We
 use
 this


language
 as
 if
 everyday
 problems
 that


are


inconveniences
 are
 actually


crises.
 And
 when
 we
 do
 that,
 we
 make


impotent
 our
 the
 ability
 of
 our


workforce
 to
 actually
 manage
 something


that
 is


significant.
 So
 what
 is
 significant?
 A


real
 crisis
 is
 any
 negative
 event
 that


has
 the
 potential
 to
 threaten
 an


organization's
 financial
 well-being,


reputation,
 or


legitimacy.
 I
 think
 it's
 pretty
 safe
 to


say
 that
 what
 we're
 experiencing
 now,


the
 tumult
 across
 the
 world,
 there
 are


real
 crises
 that
 people
 are
 dealing


with.
 That
 is
 what
 we
 should
 be
 focused


on.
 How
 do
 we
 help
 people
 and
 leaders


operate
 in
 these
 kind
 of
 environments?


Not
 the
 daily
 barrage
 of
 inconveniences


that
 we'd
 rather
 not
 deal


with.
 But
 we
 also
 talk
 about
 crisis
 as


if
 all
 crises
 are
 the
 same.
 And
 I
 want


to
 have
 you
 think
 about
 two
 different


types
 of
 crises.
 One
 is
 well,
 we
 talked


about
 the
 financial
 well-being,
 talked


about
 reputational


risks.
 Look
 familiar?


And
 I've
 talked
 about
 the
 legitimacy.


We're
 going
 to
 go
 into
 a
 little
 more


detail
 on
 all
 of
 these
 in
 just
 a


moment.
 Two
 different
 types
 of


crises.
 Sudden
 crises
 and
 smoldering


crises.
 Sudden


crisis
 are
 those
 kinds
 of
 events
 that


are
 typically
 externally
 imposed
 on
 an


organization.
 something
 happens
 to
 the


company
 that
 for
 the
 most
 part
 you
 have


very
 little
 responsibility
 for
 or


control
 over.
 Natural
 disasters,
 a


terrorist
 attack,
 CEO
 death,
 etc.
 These


are
 sudden
 events
 that
 happen
 that
 sort


of
 throw
 you
 off


kilter.
 How
 many
 of
 you
 spend
 your
 time


thinking
 and
 planning
 for
 a
 sudden


crisis?
 Raise
 your


hand.
 Handful.
 Okay,
 another
 type
 of


crisis,
 smoldering
 crisis.
 Smoldering


crisis
 are
 those
 things
 that
 start
 out


small
 and
 internal
 in
 the
 organization


that
 should
 be
 spotted
 as
 a
 problem,
 but


oftentimes
 go
 ignored
 because
 we
 think,


"Oh,
 that's
 a
 little
 thing.
 It
 it
 will


be
 fine."
 But
 because
 we've
 ignored
 it,


it
 tends
 to
 grow
 and
 fester
 and
 over


time
 can
 erupt
 into
 something
 more


significant.


You
 see
 on
 the
 screen
 examples
 of
 sudden


of
 smoldering
 crises,
 product
 defects,


labor
 disputes,
 safety
 violations,
 class


action
 lawsuits.
 All
 of
 these
 things
 are


signals
 that
 something
 is
 not
 right
 in


the


organization.
 How
 many
 of
 you
 spend
 your


time
 planning
 for
 these


events?
 For
 those
 of
 you
 on
 the
 screen,


very
 few
 hands
 are
 raised,
 right?


We
 plan
 largely
 for
 the
 salacious


events,
 those
 things
 like
 a
 natural


disaster.
 We
 don't
 often
 prepare


ourselves
 as
 leaders
 or
 our


organizations
 for
 these
 kinds
 of
 events.


Which
 are
 you
 more
 likely
 to
 encounter?


A
 sudden
 event
 or
 a
 smoldering


event?
 A
 smoldering
 event?
 Right?
 These


are
 much
 more
 common
 place
 in


organizations.


The
 good
 news
 is
 that
 we
 as
 executives,


as
 leaders,
 have
 a
 bias
 for
 action.
 So


when
 something
 happens,
 we
 immediately


want
 to
 go
 into
 containment
 mode.
 We


want
 to
 engage
 in
 damage


control.
 Makes
 perfect
 sense.
 But
 I


would
 argue
 that
 containment
 and
 damage


control
 is
 a
 necessary
 but


insufficient
 aspect
 of
 leadership


particularly
 in
 times
 of
 crisis.


That's
 all
 we
 focus
 on.
 We're
 not


creating
 a
 culture
 of
 a
 workforce
 that


understands
 and
 knows
 how
 to
 deal
 across


the
 crisis
 landscape
 which
 happens


before
 the
 event
 happens,
 not
 just
 once


something
 happens
 and
 you
 have
 to
 go


into
 response
 mode.
 So
 I
 want
 to
 spend
 a


little
 bit
 of
 time
 talking
 about
 what


are
 the
 characteristics,
 what
 are
 the


actions
 that
 leaders
 should
 be
 engaged


in
 to
 build
 a
 culture
 of
 resiliency
 in


order
 to
 respond
 to
 crisis.
 So,
 first
 is


paying
 attention
 to
 the


signals
 in
 your


environment.
 Those
 signals
 could
 be
 uh


information
 that
 you're
 receiving
 from


employees,
 could
 be
 insights
 that
 you're


receiving
 from
 your
 customers
 or


clients,
 it
 could
 be
 feedback
 going
 on


in
 the
 industry,
 it
 could
 be
 something


that's
 happened
 to
 a


competitor.
 Right?
 All
 of
 these
 are


pieces
 of
 information
 that
 leaders


should
 be
 paying
 attention
 to


recognizing
 that
 what's
 happening
 in
 the


environment
 could
 just
 as
 easily
 happen


to
 their
 organization.
 So
 paying


attention
 to
 the
 signals.
 Next,
 once
 you


have
 that
 information,
 what
 do
 you
 do


with
 it?
 Great
 leaders
 actually
 take
 the


time
 to
 work
 with
 their
 teams
 to
 prepare


for
 some
 of
 those
 eventualities.
 Of


course,
 we
 can
 never
 identify
 or
 predict


or
 prepare
 for
 everything
 that
 could


possibly
 go
 wrong.
 But
 getting
 into
 the


practice
 of
 even
 thinking
 about
 one


possibility
 or
 recognizing
 some
 signal


that
 is
 happening
 within
 your
 industry


and
 going
 through
 the
 exercise
 with
 your


teams,
 what
 would
 we
 do
 if
 it's
 the


scenario
 planning,
 it's
 the
 preparation


and
 the
 planning
 for
 something
 that
 goes


wrong.
 By
 doing
 that,
 you're
 building


muscle,
 leadership
 muscle,
 crisis


leadership
 muscle,
 so
 that
 when


something
 does
 happen,
 you've
 already


got
 some
 foundation
 from
 which
 to
 to


start.
 Now,
 inevitably,
 you
 will
 face,


you
 will
 have
 some
 kind
 of
 experience


that
 you'd
 rather
 not,
 some
 crisis,
 and


at
 that
 point,
 you
 do
 need
 to
 go
 into


response
 mode.
 You
 need
 to
 think
 about


damage
 control.
 How
 do
 I
 manage
 this


impression?
 How
 do
 I
 deal
 with
 how
 do
 I


stop
 the
 bleeding
 of
 what's
 happening
 in


this
 moment?
 That's
 the
 stuff
 we're


generally
 already
 really
 good


at.
 But
 what
 happens
 after
 we
 engage
 in


our
 recovery
 practice
 or
 in
 our
 our


containment


practices,
 we
 wipe
 our
 brow
 and
 we


think,
 glad
 that's
 done.
 Now
 we
 can
 get


back


to
 business
 as
 usual.
 Now
 we
 can
 get


back
 to
 normal.


But
 here's
 the
 problem.
 If
 this
 were
 a


crisis
 that
 only
 happened
 to
 your


company
 and
 you
 exist
 in
 a
 broader


industry,
 what
 is
 everybody
 else
 doing


while
 you
 were
 managing
 your


crisis?
 They
 were
 continuing
 with
 their


strategic
 objectives.
 So
 if
 your
 goal


post
 crisis
 is
 to
 get
 back
 to


normal,
 chances
 are
 you're
 going
 to
 come


out
 of
 that
 crisis
 many
 more
 steps


behind
 your
 peers
 who
 were
 able
 to


leverage
 that
 time
 to
 continue
 to


advance
 their


strategy.
 So
 the
 focus
 around


containment,
 containment
 and
 damage


control
 isn't
 about
 getting
 back
 to


normal.
 It's
 about
 thinking
 where
 can
 we


go
 from
 here?


What
 is
 the
 phoenix
 rising
 from
 the


ashes
 after


this
 mess
 that
 we've
 been
 a
 part
 of?


Asking
 yourself,
 asking
 your
 teams
 those


questions.
 How
 do
 we


recover
 from
 this
 circumstance
 in
 a
 way


that
 will
 position
 us
 to
 be
 better,
 to


be
 stronger,
 to
 be


resilient?
 Right?


And
 then


lastly,
 something
 we've
 been
 talking


about
 all
 afternoon,


learning.
 The
 best
 leaders
 and
 therefore


the
 best
 companies
 are
 those
 that
 take


these
 moments
 of
 crisis,
 of
 tumult
 of


extreme
 change
 and


recognize
 how
 do
 we
 engage
 in
 an


activity
 of
 reflection.
 In
 the
 military,


they
 call
 it
 the
 afteraction
 review.
 How


do
 we
 go
 through
 this
 methodical
 process


to
 understand
 what
 lessons
 we
 should


take
 from
 what
 we've
 just
 experienced?


What
 role
 did
 we
 play
 in
 creating
 this


crisis?
 What
 ways
 were
 we
 prepared
 or


not


prepared?
 That
 process
 of
 learning
 will


position
 you
 for
 both
 preventing
 or


mitigating
 something
 like
 this
 from


happening
 again.
 And
 even
 more


importantly,
 it
 can
 enhance
 the


likelihood
 that
 you
 will
 use
 these


learnings
 to
 actually


innovate.
 You've
 all
 heard
 the
 phrase


never
 waste
 a
 good
 crisis.
 I
 don't


particularly
 like
 that
 phrase
 because
 I


phrase
 because
 I
 think
 it's
 kind
 of


trit,
 but
 what
 underlies
 it
 is
 actually


true.
 Those
 companies
 who
 have
 come
 out


of
 really
 tumultuous
 circumstances
 the


best
 are
 the
 ones
 who
 have
 gone
 through


the
 learning
 reflection
 process
 and


identified


opportunities
 to
 lead
 to
 create
 a
 new


product
 to
 be
 innovative
 to
 drive
 the


sector
 forward
 in
 ways
 that
 they
 never


would
 have
 considered
 doing
 had
 it
 not


been
 for
 the


crisis.
 This
 this
 is
 crisis
 leadership.


all
 five
 of
 those
 stages,
 not
 just


engaging
 in
 the
 damage
 control
 or
 the


response.
 So
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 for
 you


as
 a


leader
 when
 you
 think


about
 over
 a
 period
 of
 time?
 What
 is


your
 response
 mechanism?
 If
 our
 focus
 is


on
 damage
 control,
 if
 our
 focus
 is
 on


simply
 responding
 to
 or
 reacting
 to
 the


here
 and
 now,
 we
 might
 fix
 that
 problem,


but
 we're
 not
 setting
 ourselves
 up
 to


really
 reap
 the
 benefits
 that
 could
 come


from
 the
 learning
 that
 takes
 place
 from


those


situations.
 The
 management
 behaviors,


you
 see
 them
 here.
 You're
 reactive.


You're
 focused
 on
 damage
 control.
 It's
 a


short-term
 focus.


limited
 stakeholder
 engagement
 because


you
 surround
 yourself
 by
 a
 very
 small


group
 of
 people
 and
 you
 hunker
 down
 in


the
 war
 room
 and
 you
 say,
 "Here's
 what


we're
 going
 to
 do."
 Right?
 Some
 of
 what


we
 heard
 earlier
 today
 is
 how
 do
 I


engage
 more
 people?
 How
 do
 I
 go
 to
 the


person
 who's
 five
 levels
 down
 from
 me


but
 is
 on
 the
 ground
 floor
 and


understands
 what
 or
 why
 we're
 in
 this


situation
 and
 how
 do
 I
 build
 that


information
 into
 my
 decision-making


going
 forward?


Okay,
 these
 management
 practices
 are
 not


bad.
 They're
 not
 wrong.
 They
 are
 in
 fact


necessary.
 But
 if
 that's
 all
 we
 do,
 then


we're
 not
 building
 a
 culture
 for


success.
 If
 instead
 we
 think
 about,
 yes,


we
 have
 to
 be
 responsive
 in
 the
 moment,


but
 over
 time
 there's
 still
 more
 work
 to


do.
 We
 need
 to
 identify
 what
 the


opportunities
 are
 around
 the
 business


recovery.
 We
 need
 to
 start
 engaging
 in


learning
 practices.
 That's
 what


differentiates
 those
 companies,
 those


leaders
 who
 are
 successful
 in
 managing
 a


crisis
 from
 those
 that
 are
 not.
 Here
 are


some
 examples
 of
 leadership
 behaviors


during


crisis.
 You're
 building
 trust
 into
 your


system.
 The
 worst
 thing
 is
 if
 a
 crisis


happens
 and
 you
 have
 not
 created
 that


foundation
 of
 trust
 within
 your


workforce
 or
 with
 your
 clients
 or


customers.


when
 something
 happens
 and
 you
 then
 need


them
 to
 be
 there
 for
 you.
 If
 you
 don't


have
 that
 foundation
 of
 a
 trusting


relationship,
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 in


that
 context.
 They
 don't
 want
 to
 be


stuck
 in
 a
 really
 bad
 situation,
 that's


when
 most
 people
 find
 the
 door
 and
 exit


immediately.
 But
 if
 they've
 been
 with


you
 all
 along,
 if
 they
 trust
 you
 as
 a


leader,
 if
 they
 believe
 that
 you've
 had


their
 best
 interest
 at
 heart,
 that's


when
 you
 get
 the
 team
 of
 people
 that
 you


need
 and
 you
 go
 through
 this
 together.


Building
 trust
 is
 a
 critical
 aspect
 of


leadership
 and
 building
 culture.
 Again,


being
 prepared,
 thinking
 about
 what
 are


the
 possibilities
 that
 might
 come
 from


this


experience,
 engaging
 in
 reflection
 and


engaging
 in
 learning.
 This
 is
 what
 we


teach
 our
 students
 and
 this
 is
 what
 I


know
 the
 best
 companies
 and
 the


strongest
 cultures
 engage
 in.
 So,
 what


are
 the
 opportunities
 to
 be
 realized?


one,
 decreasing
 the
 limit
 the


possibility
 or
 likelihood
 of
 future


negative
 events
 or
 two
 increasing
 the


possibility
 of
 future
 positive
 events.


It's
 that
 simple.
 You
 operationalize


what
 those
 outcomes
 are,
 but
 it's
 either


going
 to
 be
 good
 or


bad.
 I
 will
 end
 by
 sharing
 that
 we
 think


about
 the
 triple
 bottom
 line.
 I
 like
 to


think
 of
 it
 as
 a
 quadruple
 bottom
 line.


One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we
 must
 be


thinking
 about
 as
 leaders
 is
 preparing.


Preparing
 ourselves,
 preparing
 our


teams,
 preparing
 our
 organizations
 for


the
 unexpected.
 And
 Lord
 knows
 we
 are
 in


an
 environment
 right
 now
 where
 a
 lot
 of


things
 feel
 unexpected.
 And
 those
 who


have
 been


prepared
 are
 the
 ones
 who
 will
 come
 out


of
 this
 context
 the
 best.
 Thank
 you.


Thank
 you,


Erica.
 As
 we
 dive
 deeper
 into
 leadership


and
 corporate
 culture,
 I'm
 pleased
 to


announce
 our
 next
 speaker,
 Mark


Schneider,
 the
 former
 CEO
 of


Nestle.
 From
 morning
 coffee
 to
 evening


treats,
 Nestle
 touches
 billions
 of
 lives


each
 day.
 Under
 Mark's
 leadership,
 from


2017
 to
 2024,
 Nestle
 went
 through
 a


remarkable


transformation.
 Prior
 to
 Nestle,
 Mark


was
 the
 CEO
 of
 the
 Fresnius
 Group
 for
 13


years.
 With
 over
 three
 decades
 of


leadership
 experience,
 Mark
 brings


unique
 insights
 into
 how
 corporate


culture
 can
 transform
 business


excellence
 and
 long-term
 performance.
 We


can't
 wait
 to
 hear
 from
 you,
 Mark.


Please
 join
 us
 on
 the
 stage.


[Applause]


Well,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 the
 kind


introduction
 and
 also
 thank
 you
 to
 Nogus


Bank
 for
 this
 invitation.
 And
 it's
 a
 new


situation
 because
 in
 the
 past
 when
 I
 had


speeches
 like
 this,
 I
 would
 be
 supported


by
 lots
 of
 samples
 in
 the
 back
 of
 the


room,
 KitKat,
 chocolate,
 espresso


coffee,
 what
 have
 you.
 Today,
 I
 have
 to


convince
 you
 just
 by
 the
 strength
 of
 my


argument.
 So,
 it's
 a
 bit
 of a
 higher


hurdle.
 And
 um
 I'm
 asking
 for
 your


understanding.
 Um
 I
 wanted
 to
 blow
 out


Norris
 Bank
 for
 not
 just
 the
 invitation


but
 also
 for
 adding
 leadership
 and


culture
 to
 the
 roster
 and
 the
 agenda
 of


this
 conference
 because
 many
 of
 you
 in


the
 room
 are
 experts
 at
 running
 your


DCFS,
 valuing
 a
 company,
 valuing
 a


business
 opportunity.
 But
 I
 do
 believe


that
 having
 a
 handle
 and
 having
 your
 own


thoughts
 about
 a
 business's
 culture
 and


leadership
 is
 an
 important
 consistency


check.
 It's
 another
 dimension
 that
 helps


you
 tell
 apart
 a
 story
 that
 just
 sounds


good
 on
 a
 PowerPoint
 from
 a
 story
 that


is
 true
 quality
 and
 that's
 more
 likely


to
 be
 resilient
 and
 sustainable.
 We


heard
 in
 the
 previous
 panel,
 you
 know,


quality
 companies
 are
 hard
 to
 find.
 And


I
 do
 believe
 that
 one
 thing
 that
 all


quality
 companies
 have
 in
 common
 is
 this


strong
 culture.
 Something
 that
 creates
 a


legends
 between
 the
 executives
 working


for
 that
 business
 and
 the
 company
 and


also
 among
 the
 executives
 between
 each


other
 as
 a
 team
 and
 uh
 hence
 it's


important.
 Now
 I
 wanted
 to
 share
 a
 few


thoughts
 on
 this.
 So
 first
 of
 all
 to
 put


in
 the
 overall
 perspective
 of
 a
 CEO's


job
 um
 there's
 lots
 of
 things
 you're


doing
 day
 in
 day
 out.
 I
 would
 group
 them


into
 three
 major
 buckets.
 And
 this
 is


not
 by
 order
 of
 importance
 just
 to


enumerate
 them.
 The
 first
 one
 is


portfolio
 and
 strategy.
 So
 what
 is
 it
 as


products
 and
 services
 you're
 selling
 and


why
 do
 you
 believe
 you
 have
 longer
 term


sustainable
 competitive
 advantage
 in


it?
 Second
 part
 is
 structure
 and


incentives.
 So
 basically
 how
 do
 you


group
 the
 teams
 in
 your
 company
 in
 ways


that
 all
 of
 these
 good
 things
 are
 being


brought
 out
 the
 door
 in
 a
 successful


manner.
 And
 the
 third
 one
 is
 culture.


And
 um
 culture
 is
 something
 that
 is


somehow
 different
 from
 these
 first
 two


in
 the
 sense
 that
 you
 can't
 just
 every


once
 in
 a
 while
 revisit
 it.
 You
 have
 to


live
 it
 every
 day
 from
 the
 moment
 in
 the


morning
 you
 walk
 into
 the
 door
 to
 the


last
 email
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 What


you
 have
 to
 watch
 out
 for
 is
 not
 just


the
 factual
 answers
 you're
 giving
 or
 the


factual
 announcements
 you're
 making.
 You


also
 have
 to
 watch
 out
 for
 the


consistency
 like
 what
 signals
 am
 I


sending
 into
 the
 organization
 and
 uh


does
 that
 make
 sense
 compared
 to
 what
 I


said
 yesterday,
 last
 month,
 last
 year


because
 if
 you
 change
 your
 tune
 um
 every


so
 often,
 I
 think
 you
 do
 confuse
 the


organization.
 So
 that
 consistency
 and


being
 somehow
 in
 sync
 with
 where
 the


culture
 is
 coming
 from
 and
 where
 you


wanted
 to
 get
 to
 over
 time
 is
 really


really
 important.
 Sounds
 pretty
 obvious,


but
 look,
 I
 mean,
 CEOs
 are
 no
 robots.
 I


mean,
 we're
 humans
 and
 we're
 subject
 to


um
 moods
 of
 the
 moment.
 We're
 subject
 to


different,
 you
 know,
 exposures
 over


time.
 And
 so
 bearing
 and
 and
 and


displaying
 that
 consistency
 over
 time
 is


more
 difficult
 than
 it


sounds.
 Now,
 as
 you
 as
 investors
 look
 at


culture,
 um
 a
 few
 things
 to
 think
 about.


First
 one
 is
 culture
 is
 incredibly


sticky.
 The
 larger
 and
 the
 more
 historic


and
 iconic
 an
 organization,
 the
 more


sticky
 it
 is.
 And
 the
 reason
 that's


important
 to
 you
 is
 when
 you
 have
 CEOs


telling
 you
 that
 for
 a
 large


long-standing
 historic
 company,
 they


changed
 the
 culture
 in
 the
 course
 of
 two


or
 three
 years.
 At
 the
 risk
 of
 giving


you
 a
 provocative
 statement
 here,
 sell


the
 stock.
 Okay?
 because
 honestly
 either


these
 people
 don't
 really
 know
 what


they're
 talking
 about
 and
 are
 out
 of


touch
 with
 what's
 really
 going
 on
 inside


the
 organizations
 or
 they're
 vastly


overselling
 uh
 their
 own
 achievements.


Both
 of
 these
 are
 not
 good.
 Uh
 culture


change
 does
 take
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 and
 uh


the
 best
 way
 for
 you
 with
 your
 exposure


to
 financial
 industry
 to
 judge
 that


think
 back
 to
 all
 these
 banking
 mergers


in
 the
 1990s
 and
 early
 2000s.


To
 this
 day
 with
 many
 of
 these
 large


financial
 institutions
 when
 you
 walk


into
 these
 companies
 you
 can
 sometimes


tell
 apart
 you
 know
 one
 part
 from
 the


other
 in
 those
 mergers
 coming
 together.


So
 cultures
 are
 incredibly
 sticky
 and


industrial
 firms
 are
 not
 different
 from


that.
 Next
 one
 um


culture
 in
 most
 attributes
 is
 not
 a
 wish


list.
 So
 if
 someone
 presents
 to
 you
 a


culture
 and
 it
 has
 only
 positive


attributes,
 it's
 a
 good
 moment
 to
 be


suspicious.
 On
 most
 attributes,
 there's


a
 spectrum.
 So
 think
 about,
 for
 example,


speed
 versus
 stability.
 So
 if
 someone


claims
 that
 their
 organization
 can
 turn


on
 a
 dime
 and
 react
 in
 line
 with
 fastest


ones
 in
 the
 industry,
 what
 does
 that


mean
 for
 resilience
 in
 the
 face
 of
 bad


news?
 What
 does
 this
 mean
 for
 the


ability
 to
 sit
 out
 a
 poor
 quarter
 or
 a


poor
 year
 and
 not
 lose
 sight
 of
 some
 of


your
 longerterm
 objectives?
 And
 most
 of


these
 things
 do
 happen
 on
 the
 spectrum.


You
 can't
 just
 pick
 the
 positive
 one
 of


each
 and
 claim
 that
 that's
 your
 culture


going
 forward.
 And
 so
 when
 you
 have


these
 conversations
 in
 the
 future,
 when


you
 hear
 too
 many
 of
 the
 good
 ones,
 ask


for
 the
 bad
 ones.
 Ask
 for
 what
 it
 means


for
 the
 other
 side
 of
 the
 spectrum.
 And


you
 know,
 is
 there
 something
 in
 the


conversation
 that's
 missing?


Next
 one
 I
 wanted
 to
 talk
 about
 is
 as
 a


CEO
 how
 do
 you
 actually
 change
 and
 shape


culture
 and
 um
 in
 my
 view
 there
 are
 two


levers
 a
 short-term
 one
 and
 a
 long-term


one
 the
 short-term
 one
 is
 using
 the
 soap


box
 for
 lack
 of
 a
 better
 word
 that
 every


CEO
 has
 inside
 the
 organization
 outside


the
 organization
 where
 essentially
 you


indicate
 the
 way
 you
 want
 it
 to
 be
 And


then
 in
 addition
 to
 all
 the


communication
 events
 that
 you
 have,


whether
 it's
 small
 groups,
 individual


meetings,
 or
 large
 group
 meetings,
 when


every
 time
 you're
 facing
 a
 decision,


you're
 trying
 to
 essentially
 link
 that


decision
 to
 some
 of
 these
 attributes


you're
 talking
 about.
 And
 this
 way,
 you


kind
 of
 reinforce
 it.
 But
 that's


communication.
 And
 um
 while
 it
 travels


pretty
 fast
 in
 an
 organization,
 you
 can


only
 you
 can
 only
 go
 so
 far
 when
 it


comes
 to
 the
 sustainability.


Uh
 the
 long-term
 part,
 the
 true


stickiness
 that
 lasts
 over
 generations


is
 the
 one
 that
 happens
 through
 people.


And
 there
 it's


about
 selecting
 and
 promoting
 the
 people


that
 you
 believe
 embody
 the
 cultural


attributes
 the
 best
 way
 that
 you
 would


want
 to
 see
 for
 your
 organization
 or
 in


your
 outside
 hiring
 selectively


advancing
 those
 attributes.
 And
 there


you
 see
 why
 it
 takes
 a
 lot
 of
 time


because
 you
 can't
 turn
 over
 entire
 large


groups
 of
 leadership
 teams
 at
 the
 same


time.
 So
 this
 takes
 patience
 and
 it's


always
 a
 balance
 between
 the
 change
 you


want
 but
 then
 also
 not
 destabilizing
 the


organization
 and
 hence
 that's
 the
 reason


why
 it
 can
 easily
 take
 5
 10
 15
 years
 as


you
 know
 not
 just
 your
 senior
 leadership


team
 but
 also
 the
 next
 layers
 of
 the


organization
 um
 get
 changed
 in
 that


regard.
 That's
 the
 more
 lasting
 one.


That's
 the
 one
 that
 leaves
 a
 legacy


behind.
 And
 then
 obviously
 as
 you
 change


from
 there,
 as
 your
 environment
 changes


and
 you
 would
 want
 to
 evolve
 and
 migrate


your
 hers,
 you
 again
 have
 to
 be
 very


patient
 about
 that.
 There
 is
 no


shortcuts.
 Uh
 again,
 those
 short-term


situations
 usually


um
 do
 not
 have
 staying
 power.
 It's


important
 to
 keep
 that
 in
 mind.
 Now
 when


it
 comes
 to
 large
 organizations


um
 let
 me
 highlight
 two
 common
 pitfalls


and
 this
 is
 not
 a
 specific
 reflection
 on


any
 specific
 company
 but
 from
 many


conversations
 with
 CEO
 peers
 simply
 what


I
 heard
 and
 what
 I
 also
 experienced
 in


my
 own
 professional
 life
 and
 large


companies
 may
 have
 many
 strengths
 but


there's
 two
 common
 weaknesses
 to
 watch


out
 for
 the
 first
 one
 is
 inside
 focus
 in


many
 large
 companies
 especially
 the
 ones


that
 have
 a
 deep
 vertical
 structure.
 You


may
 spend
 a
 long
 time
 in
 your


professional
 career
 before
 you
 really


have
 to
 deal
 with
 the


outside.
 Remember,
 a
 salesperson,
 a


junior
 salesperson
 may
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 the


outside,
 but
 they're
 applying
 decisions


that
 are
 made
 at
 the
 senior
 level
 like
 a


price
 list
 for
 example.
 So,
 it's
 only
 at


the
 top
 of
 the
 organization
 where
 you


get
 into
 these
 trade-offs
 like
 raising


prices
 versus
 market
 share
 or
 some
 other


key
 decisions
 that
 link
 the
 outside
 of


the
 company
 to
 the
 inside
 of
 a
 company.


And
 the
 larger
 a
 business
 is
 um
 the


longer
 it
 takes
 executives
 to
 get
 to


that
 level
 and
 before
 all
 of
 your


advancements,
 your
 your
 your
 career


progress
 usually
 gets
 determined
 by


playing
 the
 inside
 game.
 And
 um
 that's


why
 I
 believe
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 schooling


senior
 leaders
 usually
 a
 smaller
 company


tends
 to
 be
 the
 better
 breeding
 crowd


and
 with
 larger
 companies
 that
 whole


notion
 what
 do
 you
 do
 from
 the
 top
 to


counter
 that
 inside
 thinking
 that


requires
 constant


attention.
 The
 other
 one
 is


accountability
 or
 the
 lack
 of


accountability.
 And
 here
 again,
 the


larger,
 the
 more
 complex
 the


organization,
 the
 more
 matrix
 the


organization,
 the
 more
 you
 find
 that


people
 oversell
 the
 good
 things,
 like
 25


people
 claiming
 that
 they
 were
 the
 ones


who
 created
 the
 good
 news
 and
 underell


the
 bad
 things,
 look
 the
 other
 way,


hoping
 that
 it
 doesn't
 get
 attached
 to


you.
 And
 that's
 also
 a
 very
 common


pitfall
 and
 one
 where
 like
 with
 the


inside
 focus
 there
 is
 no
 simple
 recipe


for
 how
 to
 counter
 that.
 What
 you
 have


to
 do
 as
 a
 leader
 day
 today
 is
 to
 try


and
 call
 out
 these
 situations.
 Try
 to
 be


sure
 you
 instill
 that
 outside
 thinking.


try
 to
 be
 sure
 that
 you
 do
 find
 the


people
 that
 were
 responsible
 for
 the


good
 things
 but
 also
 for
 the
 things
 that


didn't
 go
 so
 well
 and
 that
 there's


justice
 in
 the
 organization
 because
 once


people
 feel
 that
 they
 can
 get
 away
 with


a
 lack
 of
 accountability
 it
 goes


downhill
 from


there.
 So
 those
 were
 some
 of
 the
 high


level
 thoughts
 I
 wanted
 to
 share.
 I


wanted
 to
 leave
 on
 something
 that's
 a


bit
 of
 a
 gear
 shift
 from
 what
 I
 was
 just


covering
 before
 and
 that
 is
 I
 wanted
 to


tell
 you
 that
 um
 in
 total
 I've
 been


serving
 as
 a
 public
 company
 CEO
 for
 21


years
 and
 when
 I
 look
 at
 how
 leadership


teams
 have
 changed
 over
 those
 two


decades
 I've
 seen
 a
 remarkable
 change


coming
 from
 diversity
 inclusion
 and
 I've


seen
 very
 significant
 changes
 not
 just


in
 the
 sense
 of
 correcting
 historic


wrongs
 but
 also
 I've
 seen
 tremendous


benefit
 to
 the
 businesses
 because
 the


quality
 of
 the
 discussion
 has
 improved


so
 much.
 It's
 a
 whole
 different


discussion
 that
 brings
 different
 views


to
 the
 table,
 a
 lot
 more
 bandwidth
 and


kind
 of
 enabling
 organizations
 that
 are


designed
 to
 serve
 society
 to
 actually
 do


that
 because
 society
 does
 come
 with
 a


much
 broader
 cross-section
 than
 what


leadership
 teams
 used
 to
 have
 in
 the


past.
 And
 um
 what
 I
 wanted
 to
 tell
 you


is
 obviously
 in
 the
 current
 debate
 it
 is


important
 that
 for
 a
 large
 company


everyone
 follows
 the
 local
 laws
 in
 every


jurisdiction
 where
 they
 work.
 But
 I
 do


hope
 and
 I
 also
 hope
 that
 you
 as


investors
 pay
 attention
 to
 that
 that
 the


overall
 spirit
 of
 what
 can
 get
 done
 with


more
 diverse
 more
 inclusive
 leadership


teams
 that
 that
 doesn't
 get
 lost
 because


I
 do
 believe
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 true


areas
 of
 progress
 over
 the
 last
 few


decades.
 And
 I
 do
 I
 also
 believe
 there


is
 ways
 to
 go
 and
 I
 do
 believe
 that
 in


addition
 to
 the
 moral
 ethical
 standards


I
 do
 believe
 there's
 also
 business


rational
 with
 it.
 I
 stop
 it
 here
 and


look
 forward
 to
 the
 panel.


Thanks.
 Thank
 you
 Mark.
 That
 was


excellent.
 Our
 next
 speaker
 is
 Maretta


Vadwin,
 CEO
 of
 Vizma,
 a
 leading
 European


supplier
 of
 business
 critical
 software


solutions.
 Moretta
 also
 serves
 as
 a


board
 member
 for
 the
 Kongsburg
 Group
 and


sits
 in
 the
 corporate
 assembly
 and


election
 committee
 in
 Ecuin.
 Maretta


became
 CEO
 in
 2020
 after
 having
 served


as
 a
 deputy
 CEO
 and
 chief
 HR
 officer.


She
 has
 solidified
 Vizma's
 position


through
 her
 talent
 focused
 approach,


recruiting
 and
 retaining
 excellent


people
 while
 at
 the
 same
 time
 skillfully


navigating
 acquisitions
 and


organizational


restructuring.
 In
 2024,
 she
 was


recognized
 by
 Thinkers
 50
 as
 one
 of
 the


world's
 most
 inspiring
 leaders.
 Her


direct
 leadership
 approach
 combined
 with


her
 focus
 on
 execution
 means
 that


Maretta
 is
 a
 role
 model
 not
 only
 at


Visma
 but
 also
 for
 the
 broader


technology
 sector.
 Please
 welcome


Maretta
 Vvin.


[Applause]


[Music]


Thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 that
 nice


introduction
 and
 thank
 you
 Nikolai
 for


letting
 me
 present
 uh
 Visma
 today.
 Uh


that
 is
 a
 true
 honor.
 Today
 I
 will
 be


talking
 about
 how
 we
 in
 our
 company
 use


culture
 as
 a
 value
 driver
 to
 drive
 our


success.
 And
 I
 have
 to
 say
 that
 in
 Visma


we
 have
 a
 strong
 culture
 that
 we
 are


immensely
 proud
 of.
 But
 culture
 in
 Visma


is
 more
 than
 warm


words.
 It's
 not
 just
 warm


words.
 In


addition,
 it's
 more
 than
 soft
 input
 to


financial
 outcomes.
 In
 Visma,
 we


quantify
 and
 we
 operationally
 execute
 on


how
 we
 drive
 the
 culture
 and
 how
 we
 make


sure
 that
 the
 leaders
 are
 equipped
 to


drive
 the
 business
 in
 the
 way
 that
 it


should


be.
 Recognizing
 that
 some
 of
 you
 do
 not


know
 Visma,
 I
 do
 appreciate
 that
 I
 want


to
 spend
 just
 one
 minute
 on
 our


company
 today.
 We
 are
 the
 largest


privatelyowned
 company
 in
 software
 in


Europe
 and
 we
 are
 present
 in
 33
 markets


both
 in
 Europe
 and
 in
 Latin


America.
 We
 do
 pride
 ourselves
 in
 making


a
 lot
 of


acquisitions.
 Now
 in
 uh
 2024
 we
 acquired


33
 companies
 and
 that's
 a
 normal
 year


for
 Visma.
 After
 I
 became
 CEO
 in
 2020,
 I


have
 been
 a
 part
 of
 more
 than
 180


acquisitions.
 So
 this
 is
 an
 important


part
 of
 our
 growth
 journey.


Definitely.
 What
 do
 we
 do?
 Well,
 you


mentioned
 that
 really
 nicely.
 We
 provide


missionritical
 business
 processes
 and


the
 core
 of
 our
 deliveries
 is


accounting,
 payroll,
 e
 invoicing
 and


tax.
 And
 our
 customers,
 they're
 SMBs
 and


their
 local
 governments.
 And
 our


products
 and
 our
 product
 suites
 are


perfectly
 tailored
 to
 the
 local
 needs
 in


the
 markets
 in
 which
 we
 operate,
 giving


them
 a
 competitive
 advantage.
 This
 is


our
 passion
 and
 through
 our
 story,
 it's


gone
 pretty
 well.
 So
 looking
 at
 our


performance,
 we
 are
 younger
 than
 several


of
 the
 companies
 that
 have
 been


presented
 today.
 Great
 companies
 I
 have


to
 say.
 So,
 we've
 not
 been
 around
 that


long,
 but
 we've
 been
 around
 from
 1996.


And
 as
 you
 see
 on
 the
 chart,
 we
 were


delisted
 back
 in
 2006
 and
 have
 been


privately
 owned
 ever


since.
 When
 I
 joined
 Visma
 back
 in
 2011,


our
 revenue
 was
 247
 million
 euros.


Today,
 we
 are
 closing
 up
 to
 three


billion
 million
 uh
 billion.
 And
 in


addition,
 we
 have
 increased
 EBA
 by
 14


times
 in
 that
 period.
 So
 I
 have
 to
 say


that
 we
 are
 quite
 proud
 of
 uh
 our


results
 and
 I'm
 confident
 that
 we
 will


continue
 that
 journey
 going
 ahead.
 So


what
 is
 the
 reason
 for
 our
 success?
 I


usually
 say
 keep
 keeping
 it
 simple.
 It's


twofold.
 First
 of
 all,
 it's
 about
 our


strategic
 positioning.


I
 talked
 about
 how
 we
 deliver


missionritical
 business
 software
 to
 the


markets
 that
 we
 are
 present
 in.
 We
 pride


ourselves
 in
 having
 the
 latest


technology.
 We
 have
 been
 on
 a
 cloud


journey
 for
 many
 many
 years
 and
 now
 more


than
 90%
 of
 our
 revenue
 is
 cloud
 and


with
 AI
 coming
 wow
 like
 like
 Nikolai


stated
 it's
 a
 really
 nice
 time
 to
 be


alive.
 So
 many
 changes
 so
 many
 positive


changes
 going
 along.


Definitely
 in
 addition
 to
 our
 strategic


positioning
 and
 stren
 staying
 true
 to


that
 we
 enter
 in
 to
 new
 countries


through
 acquiring
 stars
 with
 the
 latest


technology,
 great
 products
 within
 our


strategic


positioning
 and
 we
 try
 to
 make
 very
 good


companies
 become
 great
 companies
 based


on
 our
 competence
 and
 what
 we
 know


staying
 close
 to
 the
 core.


In
 addition,
 our
 culture
 is
 a
 second


reason
 for
 our


success.
 We
 have
 a
 very
 strong
 culture


in
 Visma.
 Through
 acquisitions,
 we
 today


actually
 present
 uh
 the
 largest


entrepreneurial
 network
 in
 Europe.
 70%


of
 our
 the
 founders,
 they
 stay
 put
 in


Visma
 after
 5
 years.
 And
 you
 can
 think


about
 how
 you
 would
 describe
 the
 culture


of
 Visma
 actually
 with
 all
 of
 the


entrepreneurs.
 I
 don't
 have
 time
 to
 go


through
 that
 today
 but
 the
 pace
 is
 quite


fast
 and
 as
 was
 mentioned
 by
 Mark
 yes
 we


make
 mistakes
 a
 lot
 but
 we
 learn
 from


them
 we
 experiment
 and
 we
 fail


fast
 and
 these
 two
 parts
 growth
 and


culture
 they
 are
 two
 sides
 on
 the
 same


coin
 we
 do
 believe
 that
 focusing
 on


culture
 drives
 value
 so
 let
 me
 showcase


how
 we
 do
 this
 in


Visma
 I'll
 present
 another
 flywheel


today
 where
 culture
 is
 a
 massive
 driver


of
 our
 business
 and
 since
 we
 do
 a
 lot
 of


M&A
 let
 me
 give
 you
 an
 example
 on
 how
 we


operationally
 work
 with
 M&A
 within
 the


business
 and
 drive


culture.
 So
 first
 of


all,
 when
 we
 look
 for
 companies,
 we
 look


for
 stars.
 We
 look
 for
 already


successful
 entrepreneurs
 that
 have
 a


proven
 track
 record
 of
 a
 great
 product


that
 the
 customers
 like.
 And
 of
 course,


when
 you
 meet
 these
 entrepreneurs,


several
 of
 them
 we
 have
 been
 talking
 to


five,
 10
 years.
 We're
 talking
 to
 them


about
 thinking
 about
 giving
 their
 baby
 a


new
 home.
 And
 for
 all
 of
 you
 that
 are


parents,
 of
 course,
 you
 want
 to
 make


sure
 that
 that
 home
 is
 the
 best
 home
 for


that
 baby.
 So,
 the
 first
 thing
 we
 do


when
 we're
 talking
 to
 all
 of
 these


amazing
 companies
 is
 that
 we
 put
 our


sales
 hat
 on
 naturally
 and
 then
 we
 dig


into
 the


DD.
 Several
 of
 you
 as
 investors,
 you


probably
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 DD
 and
 I
 have
 the


privilege
 of
 doing
 lots
 of
 DDs
 myself.


I've
 been
 a
 part
 of
 more
 than
 300


acquisitions
 and
 of
 course
 lots
 more
 DDS


than
 that.
 And
 we
 do
 all
 the
 regular


stuff.
 We
 do
 the
 DD
 ourselves,
 the


legal,
 the
 tech,
 the
 commercial.
 The


list
 is
 long.
 But
 in
 addition
 to
 all
 of


those
 natural
 tracks,
 we
 also
 do
 a
 very


thorough
 people


DD.
 And
 to
 cut
 it
 short,
 there
 are
 two


things
 that
 are
 immensely
 important
 for


us.
 First
 of
 all,
 it's
 very
 important
 to


have
 clear


expectations.
 So
 companies
 in
 a
 process


when
 you
 do
 when
 you
 when
 you
 meet
 them,


they
 always
 have
 a
 business
 case.


And
 of
 course
 in
 the
 DD
 process
 our
 job


and
 your
 job
 as
 investors
 is
 to
 make


your
 own
 business
 case.
 When
 we
 have


done
 that
 based
 on
 our
 knowledge
 we


focus
 on
 having
 the
 tough
 discussions
 in


the
 DD
 where
 we
 showcase
 what
 our


business
 case
 looks
 like.
 Where
 do
 we


believe
 they
 should
 focus?
 Where
 do
 we


believe
 that
 they
 will
 grow?
 How
 much


growth
 do
 we
 see
 in
 the
 next
 five
 years?


And
 we
 have
 all
 the
 tough
 discussions


there
 to
 clarify
 the
 expectations.
 And


if
 we
 do
 not
 see
 in
 those
 meetings
 that


we
 find
 common
 grounds,
 we
 walk
 away


from
 the
 deal.
 If
 we
 see
 that
 we
 do
 not


see
 the
 same
 going
 into
 the
 future,
 we


walk
 away
 from
 the
 deal.
 If
 we
 see
 in


the
 negotiation
 that
 it's
 tough,
 we
 walk


away
 from
 the
 deal.
 And
 we
 showcase
 our


business
 case.
 And
 that
 actually
 becomes


the


budget
 creating
 mutual
 trust,
 no


surprises,
 all
 the
 tough
 discussions


taken
 while
 we
 do
 the
 DD.
 The
 second


thing
 that
 we
 do
 is
 that
 we
 do
 a
 lot


with
 respect
 to
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 who


are
 you,
 what
 is
 your
 culture,
 is
 it
 a


cultural
 fit,
 can
 we
 work
 together?
 And


that's
 not
 about
 being
 the
 same.
 We
 have


lots
 of
 subcultures
 in
 Visma,
 but
 it's


about
 coming
 together
 with
 the
 same
 core


values
 because
 all
 of
 us
 are
 looking
 to


work
 with
 people
 that
 we
 trust.
 So,
 we


talk
 about
 that
 as
 well
 and
 we
 look
 for


patterns.
 Do
 we
 find
 facts
 based
 on
 what


they're
 telling
 us?
 Can
 I
 trust
 the
 data


points
 coming
 in?
 We
 also
 talk
 a
 lot


about
 oneto
 ones
 with
 the
 talents.
 What


needs
 to
 be
 in
 place
 for
 you
 to
 stay
 put


in
 five
 years?
 Because
 these
 wonderful


entrepreneurs,
 these
 wonderful


employees,
 it's
 a
 successful
 company


already
 and
 all
 of
 you
 know
 how
 costly


it
 is
 to
 recruit
 and
 possibly
 wrongly


recruit.
 We
 want
 to
 keep
 them
 put.
 So


addressing
 this
 and
 figuring
 out
 if


we're
 able
 to
 deliver
 on
 these
 promises,


that
 is
 also
 something
 that
 we
 really


double
 click
 on.
 And
 when
 we
 figure
 out


that
 it's
 a
 cultural
 fit,
 the
 strategic


position
 works,
 we
 agree
 on
 the
 business


case,
 well,
 that
 is
 when
 we
 onboard
 them


to
 the
 Visma
 family.
 There
 are
 no


surprises.
 We
 onboard
 them
 to
 all
 the


KPIs
 that
 are
 important
 to
 us.
 Of


course,
 in
 addition
 to
 people,
 uh,
 we


have
 tech,
 we
 have
 customers.
 I
 don't


have
 time
 to
 go
 through
 that,
 but
 we're


very
 data
 hungry.
 So
 we
 roll
 them
 onto


the
 system
 so
 they
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 intel
 on


what
 kind
 of
 statistics
 actually
 will


drive
 growth
 into
 the
 future
 because
 in


general
 financial
 results
 are
 just
 a


consequence
 of
 you
 focusing
 on
 what


really
 drives
 the
 business.
 We
 measure,


we
 reflect
 and
 of
 course
 we
 follow
 up


and
 take
 action.
 And
 just
 to
 give
 you


some
 flavor
 as
 to
 how
 we
 do
 that
 in


Visma,
 we
 have
 people
 dashboards
 that


are
 live
 that
 they
 get
 all
 the
 time


giving
 you
 the
 natural
 KPIs.
 In
 addition


to
 the
 people
 dashboards
 that
 we
 have


made
 ourselves,
 we
 of
 course
 measure


engagement.
 We
 know
 that
 engaged


employees
 and
 the
 right
 employees,
 they


provide
 a
 lot
 better
 performance.
 And


here
 you
 see
 our
 statistics.
 Many
 of
 you


probably
 are
 aware
 of
 the
 uh
 engagement


net
 promoter
 score.
 Our
 score
 is
 63


which
 was
 represents
 the
 5%
 top
 of
 the


tech
 industry
 which
 we
 are
 definitely


proud
 of.
 But
 most
 importantly
 is
 our


leaders.
 They
 get
 the
 measures.
 They're


transparent.
 All
 the
 employees
 see
 it.


We
 do
 it
 monthly.
 So
 you
 take
 a
 pulse
 on


the
 organization
 all
 the
 time.
 Not


taking
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 to
 get
 in
 the
 data.


It's
 just
 six
 questions
 and
 they
 tra


change
 depending
 on
 where
 the
 business


needs
 to
 be
 and
 what
 kind
 of
 KPIs
 you


need
 to
 get
 in
 so
 that
 they
 get
 valuable


input
 that
 they
 can
 act
 upon
 and
 that


they
 can
 address.
 They
 get
 facts
 to
 have


good
 discussions
 with
 their


teams
 and
 what
 is
 the
 massive
 driver
 of


engagement
 that
 is
 their
 leaders.
 People


follow
 leaders.
 They
 don't
 follow


companies.
 So
 we
 measure
 this
 as
 well.


We
 have
 a
 leadership
 index.
 All
 of
 us


are
 measured.
 1500
 leaders
 including


myself.
 I
 always
 find
 it
 immensely


interesting
 when
 I
 get
 the
 feedback


because
 the
 feedback
 is
 often


unspoken.
 So
 you
 get
 a
 lot
 of


interesting
 input
 and
 it
 helps
 you
 to


figure
 out
 actually
 what
 to
 focus
 on.


And
 being
 a
 leader
 all
 of
 us
 know
 it's


not
 a
 popularity
 contest.
 It's
 hard
 work


definitely.
 But
 getting
 this
 input
 very


important
 and
 it's
 not
 as
 though
 it


always
 needs
 to
 be
 high.
 We
 change
 a
 lot


in
 Risma.
 I
 usually
 say
 that
 change
 is


our
 stability
 and
 of
 course
 in
 the
 midst


of
 a
 transition
 and
 especially
 if
 it's


not
 a
 welcomed
 one
 of
 course
 it
 will


drop
 but
 in
 the
 long
 term
 we
 cannot
 have


the
 leadership
 index
 being
 weak
 because


then
 the
 talents
 will
 leave
 because
 the


people
 they
 follow
 leaders
 they
 don't


follow
 the


companies
 and
 this
 is
 not
 to
 fingerpoint


for
 anyone
 it's
 for
 development
 and
 we


coach
 them
 and
 we
 help
 them
 we
 have


leadership
 development
 tools
 we
 need
 to


equip
 our
 leaders


Because
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 leaders


today,
 they
 didn't
 educate
 themselves


into
 being
 a
 leader.
 They
 became
 leader


because
 they
 were
 great
 with
 regards
 to


the
 field.
 So
 we
 do
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time


making
 sure
 that
 we
 help
 them
 and
 follow


up
 with
 respect
 to
 actually
 getting
 the


tools
 you
 need
 to
 be
 a
 great
 leader
 for


your
 people.


And
 then
 in
 addition,
 we
 uh
 also
 of


course
 in
 addition
 to
 getting
 your


feedback
 and
 also
 looking
 at
 like-minded


companies,
 you
 don't
 only
 get
 feedback


from
 your
 own
 company,
 you
 get
 it
 from


everyone.
 We
 put
 together
 like-minded


companies,
 like-minded
 managing


directors
 so
 that
 they
 can
 learn
 from


one
 another.
 They
 learn
 from
 their


successes,
 they
 learn
 from
 their


mistakes.
 So
 typically
 we
 often
 say
 that


we
 actually
 we
 celebrate
 also
 when
 we


make
 a
 mistake
 because
 then
 we
 can
 put


master
 classes
 out
 to
 everyone
 making


sure
 that
 they
 don't
 make
 the
 same


mistake
 again
 and
 then
 we
 put
 master


classes
 with
 the
 best
 successes
 so
 that


the
 others
 can
 copy.
 It's
 a
 very
 fast


way
 to
 be
 quite
 successful
 early


out.
 And
 how
 do
 we
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 are


innovative
 and
 that
 we
 experiment?
 Of


course
 we
 make
 mistakes
 a
 lot.
 I
 share


my
 mistakes.
 so
 important
 actually
 to


foster
 this


culture.
 In
 addition,
 of
 course,
 to


putting
 companies
 together
 and
 people


together,
 there's
 lots
 of
 mobility


within
 the


firm.
 And
 then
 you
 go
 back
 to
 the


flywheel
 and
 we
 show
 the
 value
 and
 the


value
 you
 perceive.
 If
 you
 look
 back
 the


recent
 three
 years
 doing
 several


acquisitions,
 uh
 it's
 quite
 easy
 for
 me


to
 showcase
 the
 value
 that
 we
 provide


for
 our
 companies.
 We
 acquire
 very
 very


good
 companies
 and
 in
 tech
 we're
 always


measured
 on
 the
 rule
 of
 40.
 You
 add
 up


the
 margin,
 the
 EITA
 margin,
 and
 in


addition
 you
 add
 up
 the
 revenue
 growth.


And
 on
 average,
 you
 see
 here
 the
 light


blue
 is
 all
 of
 these
 100
 acquisitions


that
 we've
 done
 these
 recent
 years
 and


what
 their
 rule
 of
 40
 score
 was
 when


they
 entered
 in.
 The
 second
 bubble
 is


what
 their
 rule
 of
 40
 score
 was
 after


one
 year
 in
 Visma
 and
 that
 actually


increased
 eight
 points.
 That's
 pretty


nice.
 So
 I
 will
 go
 back
 to
 where
 I


started.


We
 have
 historically
 done
 pretty
 good.


I'm
 very
 very
 proud
 of
 that.
 And
 why
 do


I
 feel
 confident
 that
 we
 will
 continue


our
 journey
 going
 forward?
 We
 will
 stay


very
 focused
 on
 our
 strategic


positioning.
 I
 like
 what
 was
 commented


early
 you
 earlier.
 You
 can't
 be


everything
 for
 everyone.
 Uh
 we
 are
 very


niche.
 We're
 very
 true
 to
 our
 strategic


positioning.
 And
 in
 addition
 to
 that,


even
 though
 we
 are
 a
 tech
 company,
 we


will
 be
 continuously
 working
 to
 build


this
 culture
 which
 is
 so
 so
 strong
 in


Visma
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


people
 want
 connection.
 They
 don't
 want


perfection.
 Thank


you.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much,
 Meritta.
 Could
 I


invite
 you
 to
 take
 a
 seat
 as
 we


transition
 into
 a
 panel


discussion?
 I'd
 like
 to
 invite
 Mark
 and


Erica
 to
 join
 us
 on
 the
 stage
 again.


Erica
 will
 be
 guiding
 this
 discussion
 on


how
 different
 leadership
 approaches
 can


transform
 organizational
 culture.


[Music]


[Applause]


[Music]


Thank
 you.
 I
 feel
 very
 fortunate
 to
 be


able
 to
 moderate
 a
 panel
 after
 having


heard
 both
 of
 you.
 As
 you
 know,
 we
 had


questions
 in
 advance,
 but
 I
 have
 so
 many


more
 questions
 now
 that
 I've
 heard
 both


of
 your
 remarks.
 And
 I
 actually
 want
 to


start
 with
 something
 that
 was
 a
 theme


through
 both
 of
 your
 your
 comments,
 and


that
 is
 around
 the
 people.
 Um,
 Moretta,


I'll
 start
 with
 you
 because
 I
 find
 it


interesting
 that
 prior
 to
 becoming
 the


sole
 CEO,
 you
 had
 a
 a
 career
 in
 HR
 or


that's
 not
 typically
 a
 job
 that
 is


promoted
 into
 the
 CEO
 role.
 Tell
 us
 a


little
 bit
 about
 what
 you
 learned
 about


leadership
 by
 leading
 the
 human


resources
 function.


Well,
 uh,
 I
 know
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an


odd
 way
 to
 enter
 in
 as
 as
 a
 CEO
 and
 and


stepping
 back,
 it
 was
 previously
 talked


about,
 you
 talked
 about
 Enron.
 Uh,
 I
 was


working
 in
 Arthur
 Anderson
 at
 the
 time.


I
 was
 a
 financial
 management
 consultant


and
 it
 led
 to
 the
 dissolution
 of
 an
 of


Anderson
 and
 in
 Norway
 at
 that
 point
 in


time,
 we
 were
 merged
 with
 EY.
 Uh,
 we


were
 approximately
 200
 2,000
 people
 in


EY,
 2,000
 people
 in
 Arthur
 Anderson.
 And


everyone
 thought
 that
 this
 merger
 was


going
 to
 be
 great
 and
 simple
 because
 the


two
 companies
 they
 provided
 the
 same


services.
 And
 I
 was
 asked
 to
 analyze
 and


to
 uh
 to
 get
 the
 possibility
 actually
 to


to
 merge
 these
 two
 and
 colllocate
 26


offices.
 And
 during
 that
 time
 I
 did
 the


math
 afterwards.
 Some
 of
 the


collocations
 were
 were
 were
 great.
 Some


of
 them
 were
 not
 so
 great.
 And
 the


pattern
 was
 this.
 where
 we
 had
 great


leadership,
 where
 they
 were
 able
 to
 come


together
 from
 a
 cultural
 perspective


because
 at
 that
 point
 in
 time
 the


culture
 was
 quite
 different
 in
 these
 two


great
 companies
 but
 it
 was
 different
 and


sticky
 where
 they
 were
 able
 to
 work


together
 that
 actually
 worked
 and
 we
 got


financial
 great
 performance
 where
 they


weren't
 we
 had
 a
 struggle
 so
 that


actually
 made
 me
 want
 to
 move
 over
 to


working
 with
 HR
 and
 and
 since
 then
 uh


also
 during
 my
 studies
 I
 I
 studied


psychology
 I've
 and
 coaching
 and
 and
 I'm


very
 passionate
 about
 the
 area.
 So,
 um
 I


usually
 say
 that
 winning
 in
 most


businesses
 is
 more
 about
 having
 the


right
 people
 than
 anything
 else.
 I
 feel


lucky
 that
 I
 have
 been
 able
 to
 actually


see
 how
 performance
 is
 so
 tightly
 linked


to
 leadership
 and
 I
 learn
 something
 new


with
 respect
 to
 leadership
 every
 single


day.
 Uh
 so
 as
 as
 long
 as
 you're
 able
 to


sort
 of
 speak
 of
 these
 warm
 words


culture
 and
 actually
 operationalize
 it


in
 the
 way
 that
 we
 have
 in
 Visma
 uh
 it


runs
 really
 nicely.
 Yeah.
 Thank
 you.
 So


Mark,
 I
 want
 to
 pick
 up
 on
 what
 you


ended
 on
 and
 that
 is
 um
 what
 the


insights
 that
 you've
 had
 around
 the
 role


of
 diversity
 and
 inclusion
 in
 the


workforce
 and
 as
 you
 also
 alluded
 to


certainly
 in
 the
 United
 States
 that's


something
 that
 is
 under
 tremendous


pressure
 at
 the
 moment
 but
 I'm
 wondering


given
 your
 journey
 your
 leadership


journey
 now
 across
 multiple
 companies
 21


years
 as
 a
 CEO
 how
 did
 you
 come
 to


identify
 that
 um
 engaging
 and
 and and


finding
 ways
 to
 build
 a
 culture
 around
 a


diverse
 community
 was
 so
 central
 to
 the


success
 of
 the
 companies
 that
 you've


run.
 Look,
 I
 think
 like
 most
 leaders
 and


most
 corporations,
 it
 happens
 step
 by


step
 because
 those
 20
 years
 with
 a
 lot


of
 company,
 a
 lot
 has
 changed
 and
 um


when
 I
 compare
 you
 know
 today's


executive
 leadership
 team,
 whether
 it's


Nestle,
 Fzenius
 or
 any
 other
 large


company
 I'm
 aware
 of
 to
 what
 it
 was
 like


uh
 20
 25
 years
 ago,
 it's
 certainly
 a
 lot


more
 diverse.
 it
 represents
 the
 globe
 in


much
 better
 ways.
 There's
 better
 gender


representation
 and
 um
 I
 found
 that
 in


addition
 to
 bringing
 these
 different


perspectives
 to
 the
 table,
 the
 tone
 of


the
 table
 also
 changed.
 It's
 no
 longer


just
 about
 ramming
 something
 through
 and


trying
 bulldozing,
 you
 know,
 other


arguments.
 It's
 about
 a
 true
 competition


of
 ideas
 and
 also
 frankly
 most
 of
 the


time
 a
 more
 civilized
 debate.
 And
 um
 so


when
 you
 see
 that
 and
 when
 you
 see


better
 decisions,
 better
 results
 coming


out
 of
 that
 uh
 over
 time,
 step
 by
 step,


you
 become
 a
 true
 believer.
 Uh
 I
 do
 want


to
 highlight
 nonetheless
 and
 this
 is


important
 to
 me.
 I
 mean
 we
 were
 doing


two
 things
 all
 of
 us
 over
 those
 years.


One
 is
 we
 were
 correcting
 historic


wrongs.
 Let's
 not
 lose
 sight
 of
 that.


Diversity
 inclusion
 is
 not
 a
 business


tool
 only.
 Okay?
 It
 delivers
 results.


It's
 it's
 one
 of
 these
 perfect
 cases
 of


doing
 well
 and
 doing
 good
 at
 the
 same


time.
 And
 that's
 important
 to
 me
 because


let's
 not
 belittle
 it
 to
 just
 being
 a


strategy.


Thank
 you
 for
 sharing
 that.


Um
 Merit,
 I
 know
 that
 part
 of
 what's


important
 to
 you
 around
 the
 diversity


space
 is
 women
 and
 you
 talk
 about
 the


role
 of
 or
 your
 your
 desire
 to
 ensure


that
 women
 are
 actively
 engaged
 in
 the


work
 at
 Visma
 and
 other
 places.
 Tell
 us


more
 about
 why
 that
 has
 been
 important


to
 you
 and
 how
 you've
 seen
 it
 evolve.


Well,
 specifically,
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 the


most
 important
 part
 of
 diversity.
 You


mentioned
 it
 very
 well,
 Mark,
 and
 it's


really
 important
 to
 increase
 the
 talent


pool.
 And
 what
 we
 have
 experienced,


especially
 in
 tech
 and
 especially
 when


you
 acquire
 a
 lot
 of
 amazing
 companies


in
 general,
 the
 entrepreneurs,
 there
 are


very
 few
 female
 entrepreneurs.
 Uh
 I


unfortunately
 can
 hardly
 remember
 uh


many
 companies
 that
 we
 have
 acquired


where
 the
 females
 uh
 were
 entrepreneurs.


Um
 and
 I
 think
 that
 also
 is
 maybe
 on


average
 a
 gender
 difference
 that
 that


that
 men
 are
 more
 risktakers.
 If
 I
 look


at
 the
 portfolio
 of
 all
 the
 companies
 we


have
 as
 the
 companies
 grow
 and
 become


more
 sizable
 and
 more
 structured
 we
 have


more
 females
 coming
 in
 uh
 and
 actually


professionalizing
 to
 a
 larger
 extent.


There's
 lots
 of
 uh
 I'm
 just
 trying
 to


sort
 of
 average
 it
 out,
 but
 for
 me
 it's


been
 extremely
 important
 to
 increase
 the


talent
 pool.
 It's


been
 interesting
 to
 see
 how
 you
 need
 to


tailor
 ads
 and
 how
 you
 approach
 females


versus
 male
 because
 we
 have
 different


preferences.
 uh
 we
 have
 always
 these


past
 years
 been
 spending
 a
 lot
 of
 time


making
 sure
 that
 we
 poke
 people
 uh
 on
 on


their
 shoulder
 if
 we
 believe
 that
 they


should
 actually
 apply
 for
 a
 job
 because


on
 average
 a
 lot
 of
 males
 can
 look
 at
 a


description
 and
 say
 I
 know
 50%
 I'll
 go


for
 it
 while
 the
 females
 go
 I
 know
 90%


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 apply
 so
 so
 actively


pinpointing
 to
 get
 more
 people
 and
 a


more
 diverse
 group
 in
 the
 process
 that


has
 had
 a
 really
 good
 result
 and
 now


we're
 actually
 at
 36
 and
 a
 half%
 of


female
 leadership
 in
 Visma.
 Could
 I
 just


build
 on
 that?
 That
 meshes
 incredibly


well
 with
 my
 experience.
 So
 the
 number


of
 times
 I
 was
 actively
 motivating,


encouraging
 women
 to
 take
 a
 promotion


where
 they
 felt
 they
 weren't
 ready.
 I've


never
 heard
 that
 from
 a
 man.
 And
 so


clearly
 there's
 something
 here
 that
 um


you
 know
 you
 actively
 have
 to
 kind
 of


push
 for
 and
 work
 forward
 to
 make
 it


happen.
 That
 same
 dynamic
 happens
 in
 the


NBA
 classroom
 as
 well.


see
 that
 quite
 regularly.
 Um,
 so
 one
 of


the
 outcomes
 of
 a
 diverse
 workforce
 is


innovation.
 There's
 plenty
 of
 research


that
 says
 that
 the
 more
 diversity
 you


have
 in
 in
 the
 decision-
 making
 and
 the


the
 idea
 generation,
 the
 more


innovative,
 the
 more
 creative
 outcomes


will
 will
 result.
 But
 at
 the
 same
 time


when
 you
 have
 that
 diversity
 it's
 it's


because
 there
 are
 differences
 in
 how


people
 approach
 the
 world
 that
 it
 can


become
 contentious
 or
 challenging.
 It


can
 take
 longer.
 How
 do
 you
 balance
 the


benefit
 of
 the
 great
 outcome
 from
 a


diverse
 environment
 visav
 the
 the


tension
 that
 is
 oftentimes
 created
 when


you
 have
 people
 from
 disperate


perspectives.


Erica
 the
 risk
 of
 twisting
 it
 slightly


when
 it
 comes
 to
 innovation.
 I
 mean


obviously
 no
 one
 here
 in
 the
 room
 would


disagree.
 It's
 a
 positive
 thing.


Everyone
 loves
 innovation.
 Um
 the
 moment


of
 truth
 is
 when
 it
 goes
 wrong.
 Mhm.


Okay.
 Because
 every
 time
 you
 try


something
 new
 um
 there
 is
 a
 certain
 risk


depending
 on
 what
 you're
 endeavoring
 to


do
 that
 it
 may
 fail
 and
 then
 what
 at


that
 moment
 and
 that
 separates
 in
 my


opinion
 the
 Sunday
 pep
 talk
 we
 all
 love


innovation
 from
 walking
 the
 talk.
 Um,
 so


if
 someone
 with
 the
 best
 of
 intentions,


no
 matter
 whether
 this
 is
 a
 diverse


leadership
 team
 or
 not,
 whether
 some
 if


someone
 with
 the
 best
 of
 intentions
 has


been
 trying
 to
 advance
 the
 organization,


has
 been
 trying
 new
 things,
 product


innovation,
 R&D,
 whatever,
 a
 new


marketing
 campaign
 and
 it
 falls
 flat.


How
 do
 you
 handle
 that
 situation?
 It's


usually
 bad
 news.
 It's
 usually
 something


that,
 you
 know,
 becomes
 visible.
 Uh,
 you


may
 have
 announced
 the
 product.
 Uh,
 you


may
 lose
 market
 share.
 you
 may
 not
 meet


your
 quarterly
 results
 but
 nonetheless
 I


mean
 those
 are
 the
 moments
 where
 all


these
 good
 attributes
 about
 culture
 and


you
 know
 integrity
 and
 being
 supportive


and
 all
 of
 that
 that's
 what's
 being
 put


to
 a
 test
 and
 if
 you
 then
 treat
 it
 like


the
 world
 is
 coming
 to
 an
 end
 people


will
 basically
 go
 back
 to
 their
 old


behaviors
 and
 uh
 this
 is
 what
 I
 talked


about
 earlier
 like
 moving
 away
 from
 the


accountability
 like
 it's
 someone
 else's


problem


you
 like
 to
 add
 anything
 to


Well,
 in
 in
 Visma,
 we
 we
 have
 a


difference
 between
 experiments
 and


projects.
 And
 I
 would
 say
 that
 projects


are
 typically
 me
 delivering
 on
 the


budget.
 Uh
 that's
 something
 that
 we


can't
 miss.
 But
 underneath
 the
 hood,
 we


can
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 experiments.


uh
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 agree
 that
 um
 it's
 how


you
 respond
 and
 how
 you
 drive
 the


business
 and
 actually
 figuring
 out
 that


experiments
 are
 great
 and
 we
 even


experiment
 on
 acquiring
 companies.


Sometimes
 that
 goes
 wrong
 as
 well.
 And


then
 it's
 more
 about
 what
 now?
 How
 to


how
 to
 react?
 Because
 when
 things
 go


wrong,
 if
 you
 fingerpoint
 and
 don't


focus
 on
 okay,
 it's
 gone
 wrong.
 What
 do


we
 do
 now?
 What
 can
 we
 learn
 from
 this?


Then
 we
 will
 continue
 to
 innovate
 and


experiment.
 So,
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 a


balancing
 act
 and
 it's
 not
 a
 simple
 one.


when
 it
 comes
 to
 your
 question
 on
 speed


uh
 versus
 sort
 of


experimenting
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to


uh
 depending
 on
 the
 line
 of
 business


naturally
 but
 but
 but
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of


pilots
 going
 on
 and
 instead
 of
 making


everything
 perfect
 we
 let
 several


customers
 try
 the
 pilots
 and
 we
 get
 the


feedback
 and
 then
 we
 fail
 fast
 so
 in


general
 when
 we
 have
 experience
 we
 know


that
 we
 have
 succeeded
 when
 we
 know
 if


it's
 a
 success
 or
 a
 failure
 instead
 of


waiting
 to
 the
 perfect
 launch
 h
 and
 then


suddenly
 things
 go
 wrong
 because
 then


you
 actually
 become
 more
 resilient
 and


you're
 able
 to
 do
 all
 these
 experiments


at
 once
 without
 this
 huge
 process
 that


actually
 underpins
 the
 results.
 So
 I


want
 to
 pick
 up
 on
 this
 concept
 because


you
 both
 represent
 different
 types
 of
 of


firms.
 Uh
 BISMA
 is
 relatively
 new.
 It's


still
 in
 high
 hyperrowth
 mode
 etc.
 You


spent
 many
 years
 at
 Nestle
 which
 is
 a


stable
 long-standing
 company.
 what
 at
 in


Nestle
 over
 the
 time
 that
 you
 were
 there


um
 what
 have
 you
 seen
 as
 some
 of
 the


biggest
 challenges?
 So
 I
 spoke
 about


crises
 what
 were
 some
 of
 the
 big


tumultuous
 events
 that
 you
 had
 to


navigate
 when
 you
 were
 at
 at
 Nestle?


Well,
 obviously
 a
 good
 one
 to
 talk
 about


in
 general
 that
 uh
 touched
 all
 companies


was
 uh
 how
 were
 you
 dealing
 with
 a
 once


in
 a
 century
 event
 like
 CO
 and
 um
 good


example
 of
 the
 power
 of
 decentralization


because
 there
 was
 no
 way
 from
 one
 place


on
 earth
 to
 try
 to
 manage
 that


situation.
 uh
 there's
 a
 few
 things
 that


you
 know
 you
 can
 give
 out
 as
 principles


like
 uh
 you
 know
 you
 trust
 that
 people


will
 follow
 those
 principles
 but
 uh
 all


the
 laws
 locally
 were
 different
 and
 um


the
 timelines
 were
 different
 and
 then


you
 really
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those


moments
 where
 in
 my
 opinion
 culture


shown
 because
 um
 you
 handle
 your
 own


situation
 in
 our
 case
 Switzerland
 where


the
 company
 is
 based
 and
 then
 you
 try
 to


place
 some
 of
 these
 principles
 in
 the


organization
 but
 then
 you
 have
 to
 trust


that
 in
 197
 countries
 people
 will
 make


it
 happen.
 one
 of
 the
 events
 I
 literally


remember
 from
 late
 2020.
 Um
 the
 first


time
 we
 were
 with
 all
 197
 back
 together


on
 a
 video.
 Um
 I
 wanted
 to
 talk
 about


the
 next
 stage
 of
 the
 crisis
 and
 um
 I


noticed
 everyone
 was
 talking
 about
 that


year
 and
 what
 it
 meant
 to
 them
 and
 I
 was


getting
 a
 little
 impatient
 and
 one
 of
 my


dear
 colleagues
 he
 was
 sort
 of
 tugging


me
 on
 the
 shirt
 and
 saying
 let
 them


talk.
 They
 need
 to
 talk.
 I
 mean
 they
 did


something
 really
 really
 amazing
 and
 that


is
 adjust
 to
 this
 once
 in
 a
 century


crisis
 with
 flying
 colors.
 Um
 they
 need


everyone
 have
 their
 traumatic
 experience


that
 need
 to
 talk
 and
 then
 we'll


transition
 to
 you
 know
 what
 are
 we
 doing


in
 2021.
 Um
 but
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those


where
 clearly
 in
 a
 broadbased
 global


corporation
 um
 if
 you're
 trying
 to


handle
 this
 from
 one
 place
 you'll
 fail


and
 this
 is
 where
 culture
 takes
 over.


Absolutely.
 So
 if
 I
 have
 my
 timing


correct,
 you
 started
 at
 Visma
 in
 2020.


Uh
 the
 CEO
 2020.
 I
 started
 in
 Visma
 in


2011.
 Yes.
 But
 I
 started
 as
 CEO
 CEO
 in


2020
 when
 society
 locked
 down.
 Right.
 So


I
 want
 to
 I
 want
 to
 have
 you
 talk
 about


your
 experience
 as
 a
 leader
 coming
 into


an
 environment.
 You'd
 been
 there.
 You


you
 had
 relationships,
 you
 knew
 the


company,
 but
 you
 were
 coming
 into
 the


prominent
 leadership
 role
 at
 the
 time


when
 the
 world
 was
 being
 turned
 upside


down
 because
 of
 the
 pandemic.
 Walk
 us


through
 how
 you
 observed
 culture
 helping


Visma
 navigate
 that
 time
 period
 and
 what


role
 you
 played
 as
 a
 leader
 in
 that.


Well,
 it
 was
 definitely
 special
 times.
 I


think
 all
 of
 us
 experienced
 that
 people


need
 to
 connect.
 They
 need
 to
 meet
 up


and
 that
 was
 close
 to
 impossible
 in
 that


time.
 So
 I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 having


meetings
 virtually
 naturally
 speaking
 to


the
 whole
 organization,
 speaking
 to
 the


different
 leadership,
 having
 tailored


meetings
 to
 the
 different
 countries


where
 we
 were
 in
 because
 there
 were


different
 challenges
 depending
 on
 where


you
 were.
 Uh
 we
 have
 some
 of
 our


companies
 that
 were
 were
 sort
 of
 um
 more


scared
 than
 others
 because
 people
 were


pulling
 out
 of
 some
 of
 the
 countries.
 So


it's
 I
 think
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 I


did
 was
 communicate,
 communicate,


communicate.
 Make
 sure
 that
 uh
 our


employees
 felt
 safe,
 that
 we
 would


continue,
 that
 we
 would
 do
 our
 business


as
 we
 always
 had
 done,
 being
 the
 safe


haven.
 Uh
 and
 addition
 uh
 taking
 care
 of


our
 local
 communities
 and
 our


customers.
 And
 we
 had
 been
 working


virtually
 a
 long
 time,
 naturally
 a
 tech


business,
 but
 our
 customers,
 so
 many
 of


them,
 they
 weren't
 used
 to
 this.
 So
 it


was
 an
 immense
 pressure
 on
 the
 employees


and
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 of
 course


making
 sure
 that
 especially
 customer


support
 they
 were
 so
 heavily
 loaded
 with


work
 uh
 trying
 to
 find
 these
 small


openings
 making
 sure
 that
 we
 have
 walk


and
 talk
 with
 people
 that
 move
 that
 live


close
 to
 to
 one
 another.
 We
 have
 mentors


coming
 around.
 So
 we
 did
 a
 lot
 of


operational
 things
 just
 being
 very
 close


to
 the
 organization
 speaking
 to
 people


speaking
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 speaking
 to


the
 talents
 uh
 and
 and
 in
 general
 I


guess
 you
 can
 say
 in
 a
 time
 like
 that


either
 the
 culture
 comes
 together
 where


it
 sort
 of
 falls
 apart
 and
 and
 luckily


for
 our
 sake
 we
 we
 really
 came
 together.


I'm
 I'm
 really
 proud
 of
 what
 we


accomplished
 but
 I'm
 so
 proud
 of
 what


society
 accomplished
 in
 such
 an
 immense


shift.


Yeah.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 uh
 I
 teach


in
 business
 schools
 is
 culture
 and
 what


that
 actually
 means
 and
 where
 it
 comes


from
 and
 and
 Christian
 mentioned
 culture


strategy
 for
 breakfast
 which
 is


something
 that
 we've
 all
 heard
 um
 but
 we


don't
 often
 pay
 attention
 to
 how
 culture


is
 truly
 developed
 and
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 we
 explore
 with
 our
 students
 is


that
 culture
 is
 a
 component
 of
 three


different
 things.
 It's
 sort
 of


understanding
 the
 environment
 or
 the


context
 that
 your
 your
 company
 your


organization
 is
 in.
 It
 is
 the
 leadership


and
 the
 values
 that
 are
 propagated
 by


the
 leader
 in
 that
 company.
 And
 it's


about
 the
 strategy
 or
 the
 processes
 or


the
 policies
 that
 exist.
 And
 culture,
 a


strong
 culture
 is
 created
 when
 all
 three


of
 those
 things
 are
 in
 alignment.
 when


the
 environmental
 context
 that
 your
 firm


is
 operating
 in
 is
 aligned
 with
 the


leadership
 values
 which
 is
 aligned
 with


the
 strategy
 and
 the
 policies
 that
 are


put
 in
 place
 and
 that's
 when
 you
 create


a
 strong


culture
 and
 that's
 what
 leads
 to


results.
 Have
 you
 experienced
 or
 seen


times
 when
 there
 was
 a
 breakdown
 in
 the


alignment
 of
 those
 three
 areas
 that
 led


to
 challenges
 that
 you
 faced
 with


keeping
 the
 culture
 together?


I
 have
 to
 say
 I
 haven't.
 So,
 uh,
 going


back
 to
 when
 I
 became
 the
 CEO,
 2020


society
 lockdown
 and
 I
 think
 from
 2020


up
 until
 now,
 it's
 been
 one
 extreme


after
 the
 other,
 I
 have
 to
 say.
 And


every
 time
 we
 we
 have
 been
 able
 to
 come


together
 and
 and
 work
 together,
 but
 it


does
 take
 a
 lot
 of
 time.
 Uh,
 making
 sure


that
 you
 just
 actively
 communicate
 and


make
 sure
 that
 people
 understand.
 Not


everyone
 needs
 to
 agree
 all
 the
 time.


Everyone
 has
 a
 voice,
 but
 not
 everyone


has
 a
 vote.
 But
 but
 just
 explaining


where
 we
 are,
 keeping
 calm,
 thoughtfully


prepared
 and
 ready
 to
 act
 and
 making


sure
 that
 people
 understand
 why
 we
 do


what
 we
 do.
 Um
 I
 I
 haven't
 had
 that


opportunity
 luckily
 I
 have
 to
 say.
 Uh


but
 maybe
 you
 have
 because
 you
 have
 been


a
 CEO
 longer
 than
 me.
 It's
 been
 longer


but
 look
 I
 also
 haven't
 witnessed
 that


complete
 meltdown.
 Uh
 do
 keep
 in
 mind
 I


agree
 the
 consistency
 is
 important
 to


bring
 all
 of
 these
 three
 dimensions
 in


alignment
 is
 not
 something
 that
 happens


on
 one
 day
 on
 a
 drawing
 board.
 It's


something
 that
 you
 kind
 of
 move
 over


time
 and
 then
 hopefully
 it
 stays
 close


to
 each
 other.
 Um
 and
 the
 minute


something
 prize
 lose
 it's
 usually


because
 of
 some
 sort
 of
 change
 in
 the


environment.
 Something's
 changing
 your


industry,
 something's
 changing
 among


your
 people.
 um
 something
 that
 really


kind
 of
 brings
 it
 into
 a
 state
 of


imbalance.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 is
 important


then
 to
 react
 early
 to
 that
 before
 it


disintegrates.
 So
 it's
 one
 of
 those


where
 first
 you
 might
 just
 hear
 a
 little


noise
 and
 then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 goes


poof.
 And
 so
 it's
 important
 to
 recognize


that
 early
 and
 do
 something
 about
 it


because
 afterwards
 it
 takes
 a
 long
 time


to
 put
 it
 back
 together
 again.


Absolutely.
 We
 have
 just
 a
 couple


minutes
 left
 and
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 a


question
 for
 each
 of
 you
 and
 that
 is
 as


you
 reflect
 on
 your
 own
 leadership


journey.
 Were
 there
 or
 has
 there
 been
 a


pivotal
 experience
 for
 you
 that
 really


was
 a
 demarcation
 in
 terms
 of
 being
 a


transformation
 to
 how
 you
 thought
 and


act
 as
 a
 as
 a
 leader?


Do
 you
 want
 to
 go
 first?
 Yeah.
 Um
 so


look
 when
 you
 mentioned
 micromanagement


earlier
 and
 uh
 talking
 about
 Nikolai


that
 kind
 of
 rang
 a
 bell
 with
 me
 and
 uh


it
 was
 a
 situation
 about
 um
 20
 21
 years


ago.
 It
 was
 my
 first
 year
 as
 CEO
 at


Fzenius
 and
 things
 were
 going
 incredibly


well.
 I
 was
 very
 proud
 of
 how
 things


were
 going.
 Had
 a
 fantastic
 relationship


with
 the
 chairman
 uh
 who's
 very


supportive
 and
 um
 gave
 me
 all
 the


support
 and
 advice
 and
 um
 and
 and


coaching
 I
 needed.
 and
 at
 one
 point


after
 a
 board
 meeting
 took
 me
 aside
 and


basically
 saying
 look
 I
 couldn't
 be


happier
 as
 a
 chair
 with
 you
 as
 a
 CEO


you're
 hardworking
 you're
 transparent


you're
 on
 top
 of
 the
 facts
 I'm
 not
 sure


I
 would
 want
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 people


working
 for


you
 okay
 nice
 to
 hear
 that
 from
 your


chairman
 um
 the
 way
 he
 shoed
 in
 it
 was


absolutely
 spoton
 because
 and
 this
 was


not
 out
 of
 bad
 intentions
 when
 you
 get


promoted
 to
 a
 job
 like
 this
 age
 37
 you


don't
 want
 to
 fail
 you're
 working
 hard


and
 uh
 you
 you're
 basically
 trying
 to


ensure
 everything
 works
 just
 so
 and
 in


that
 process
 unfortunately
 you
 become


too
 prescriptive
 for
 the
 next
 people


working
 for
 you.
 So
 it's
 it's
 not
 out
 of


bad
 intentions.
 I
 don't
 think
 generally


for
 the
 rest
 of
 my
 career
 I
 was
 a


micromanager.
 It
 needed
 that
 nudge
 and


he
 had
 a
 point
 and
 I
 remember
 that
 was


probably
 the
 best
 cup
 of
 coffee
 in


business
 I
 ever
 had.
 I
 don't
 remember


what
 brand
 of
 coffee
 it
 was
 but
 the


advice
 I
 got
 was
 super
 super
 helpful
 and


as
 a
 result
 of
 that
 over
 the
 years
 uh


you
 know
 as
 long
 as
 I'm
 convinced
 that


people
 are
 pulling
 in
 the
 same
 direction


let
 them
 figure
 it
 out
 in
 their
 ways
 and


uh
 you
 know
 they
 will
 take
 the
 pride
 in


it'll
 create
 more
 allegiance
 to
 the


business
 on
 their
 side
 and
 uh
 as
 um
 you


mentioned
 earlier
 I
 think
 you
 know
 that


pride
 for
 as
 a
 leader
 of
 them
 finding


ways
 that
 you
 weren't
 aware
 of
 you
 know


that
 that's
 something
 wonderful
 no
 one


has
 are
 all
 the
 time,
 right?
 Absolutely.


Anything
 for
 you,
 Maretta?
 Uh
 very


quickly,
 I
 think
 my
 most
 learning


experience
 was
 I
 hired
 a
 managing


director
 back
 in
 the
 days.
 He
 had
 been
 a


CEO
 uh
 another
 company.
 He
 had
 the
 whole


strategy
 planned
 out.
 He
 was
 amazing
 on


all
 aspects,
 but
 when
 he
 joined,
 he
 made


all
 the
 right
 decisions,
 but
 he
 wasn't


able
 to
 get
 the
 people
 along
 for
 the


ride.
 So,
 I
 had
 to
 fire
 that
 person
 one


year
 later.
 And
 uh
 for
 me
 that
 was
 a


very
 important
 learning
 experience.
 You


have
 to
 as
 a
 managing
 director,
 as
 a


leader,
 you
 have
 to
 make
 decisions
 with


speed
 and
 conviction,
 but
 if
 you
 don't


get
 the
 people
 along
 for
 the
 ride,
 h


you're
 out
 of
 a
 job.


Well
 said.
 Thank
 you
 both
 very
 much.
