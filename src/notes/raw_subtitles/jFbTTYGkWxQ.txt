Picture
 this.
 You're
 a
 software
 engineer


in
 London.
 3
 years
 ago,
 you
 were


competing
 for
 jobs
 with
 companies


throwing
 six
 figure
 signing
 bonuses


around
 like
 confetti.
 Today,
 you're
 one


of
 90,000
 tech
 workers
 laid
 off
 globally


this
 year
 alone.
 But
 here's
 the
 twist.


While
 your
 friends
 are
 updating
 their


LinkedIn
 status
 to
 open
 to
 work,
 the
 UK


is
 simultaneously
 facing
 its
 most
 severe


tech
 skill
 shortage
 in
 history.
 How
 is


that
 possible
 that
 in
 a
 market
 flooded


with
 experienced
 talent,
 companies
 still


can't
 find
 the
 right
 people
 they
 need?


The
 answer
 reveals
 a
 fundamental
 paradox


at
 the
 heart
 of
 Britain's
 tech


revolution.
 It's
 reshaping
 everything


from
 Silicon
 Roundabout
 to
 the
 highlands


of
 Scotland.
 This
 is
 episode
 6
 of
 my


video
 series,
 Where
 to
 Run,
 where
 I


discuss
 the
 best
 cities
 for
 mid
 to


senior
 tech
 professionals
 to
 resettle


after
 the
 pandemic
 and
 the
 layoffs
 of


the
 past
 2
 years.
 This
 video
 series
 is


for
 tech
 professionals
 already
 living


and
 working
 in
 the
 US,
 Canada,
 the
 UK,


or
 the
 European
 Union.
 If
 you're
 based


outside
 these
 regions
 or
 in
 an


outsourcing
 heavy
 market,
 the
 data
 in


this
 video
 will
 not
 apply
 to
 your


situation.
 I
 do
 not
 cover
 immigration,


international
 job
 hunting,
 or
 topics


like
 how
 to
 break
 into
 tech
 without
 a


college
 degree.
 If
 that's
 what
 you're


here
 for,
 this
 probably
 isn't
 the
 right


channel,
 and
 that's
 okay.
 But
 if
 you
 are


operating
 within
 these
 markets,
 keep


watching.
 There's
 a
 lot
 ahead
 for


various
 seniority
 levels
 and
 career


tracks
 in
 tech.
 Before
 we
 start,
 please


give
 us
 a
 thumbs
 up.
 We're
 working
 very


hard
 to
 deliver
 the
 most
 accurate
 and


honest
 information
 about
 the
 tech
 market


in
 2025.
 And
 on
 today's
 episode,
 we've


got
 the
 United
 Kingdom.
 Over
 the
 past
 3


years,
 the
 UK
 sector
 has
 experienced
 a


dramatic
 way
 of
 layoffs.
 Following
 a


pandemic
 hiring
 boom,
 tech
 companies


shifted
 to
 aggressive
 cost
 cutting
 due


to
 falling
 profits,
 which
 resulted
 in


widespread
 job
 losses.
 The
 trend


persisted
 into
 2025
 with
 over
 90,000


layoffs
 recorded
 globally
 by
 May
 and


projections
 suggesting
 the
 year
 could


end
 with
 even
 more
 layoffs
 around


235,000.
 In
 the
 UK,
 these
 layoffs
 have


been
 concentrated
 in
 large
 tech
 firms


and
 pandemic
 era
 hires.
 But
 the
 impact


has
 rippled
 throughout
 the
 sector,


leading
 to
 a
 sharp
 50%
 decline
 in
 tech


job
 ads
 since
 prepandemic
 levels
 and
 the


first
 drop
 in
 software
 developer


employment
 since
 2006.
 However,
 while
 on


one
 hand
 layoffs
 have
 created


uncertainty
 and
 disrupted
 career


stability,
 they
 have
 also
 prompted
 a


shift
 in
 focus
 from
 rapid
 expansion
 to


profitability
 and
 efficiency,
 which
 yes,


are
 the
 two
 fancy
 words
 for
 smaller
 and


leaner
 teams
 for
 businesses.
 The


turbulence
 has
 led
 to
 a
 more
 competitive


job
 market
 with
 smaller
 firms
 and


startups
 seizing
 the
 opportunity
 to


attract
 experienced
 talent,
 but
 it
 has


also
 exposed
 deeper
 structural
 issues
 in


the
 UK's
 tech
 talent
 pipeline.
 The
 wave


of
 tech
 layoffs
 in
 the
 UK
 shows
 no
 signs


of
 slowing
 in
 2025
 and
 this
 is
 still
 the


turbulence
 we're
 going
 through
 after
 co


which
 has
 now
 combined
 with
 geopolitical


tensions.
 Big
 names
 like
 Meta
 have
 cut


jobs
 as
 part
 of
 their
 restructuring


efforts.
 Kasperski
 has
 also
 closed
 their


UK
 office
 entirely
 blaming
 it
 on
 the


geopolitical
 pressures.
 The
 UK
 and


London
 in
 particular
 is
 by
 far
 the


largest
 tech
 hub
 in
 Europe
 and
 here
 are


some
 examples
 of
 what
 it's
 produced.
 The


ARM
 chip,
 originally
 developed
 by


Cambridge-based
 Acorn
 Computers
 in
 the


80s.
 Its
 ultraefficient,
 low
 power


architecture,
 became
 the
 backbone
 of
 the


mobile
 revolution,
 powering
 over
 95%
 of


smartphones
 by
 2010,
 including
 nearly


every
 iPhone
 and
 Samsung
 device,
 and
 it


continues
 to
 drive
 the
 internet
 of


things
 today.
 Then
 there
 is
 the
 fintech


revolution
 where
 UKborn
 companies
 like


Monzo,
 Starling
 Bank,
 Revolute,
 and
 Wise


have
 reimagined
 what
 banking
 could
 look


like.
 mobile
 first,
 user
 centric,
 and


radically
 more
 transparent
 than


traditional
 finance.
 As
 someone
 living


in
 Canada,
 I
 can
 confirm
 it's
 hard
 to


overstate
 how
 far
 ahead
 the
 UK
 is
 in
 the


space.
 Another
 standout
 is
 Dark
 Trace,
 a


Cambridge
 founded
 cyber
 security
 company


that
 pioneered
 the
 use
 of
 AI
 and
 machine


learning
 for
 real-time
 threat
 detection.


It's
 now
 valued
 at
 over2
 billion
 pounds


and
 it's
 a
 global
 leader
 in
 autonomous


cyber
 defense.
 And
 finally,
 while


YouTube
 is
 an
 American
 product,
 key


breakthroughs
 in
 its
 mobile
 video


infrastructure,
 from
 capture
 to
 upload


to
 playback,
 were
 developed
 by
 UK-based


product
 and
 engineering
 folks.
 These


innovations
 laid
 the
 groundwork
 for


mobile
 video
 consumption
 as
 we
 know
 it


today,
 fundamentally
 changing
 how


billions
 of
 people
 create
 and
 interact


with
 the
 content
 on
 the
 go.
 Let's
 talk


about
 the
 scale
 and
 impact
 of
 tech


layoffs
 in
 the
 UK.
 The
 tech
 industry


globally
 has
 undergone
 unprecedented


workforce
 reductions
 with
 UK
 emerging
 as


the
 significant
 epicenter
 of
 these


changes.
 The
 layoff
 wave
 that
 began
 in


2022
 has
 continued
 through
 2025


reshaping
 the
 employment
 landscape
 in


fundamental
 ways.
 The
 global
 tech
 sector


experienced
 massive
 layoffs
 totaling


approximately
 263,000


in
 2023
 representing
 a
 59%
 increase
 from


2022.
 in
 2024
 with
 133,000
 employees


across
 410
 companies
 losing
 their
 jobs


by
 mid
 year.
 In
 2025,
 layoffs
 continued


with
 more
 than
 22,000
 workers
 laid
 off


industrywide
 by
 May.
 While
 the
 United


States
 is
 an
 absolute
 leader
 with
 almost


116,000
 tech
 jobs
 cut,
 the
 UK
 has


emerged
 as
 Europe's
 largest
 center
 for


tech
 workforce
 reductions.
 A
 startling


97%
 of
 UK
 tech
 businesses
 reported


making
 redundancies
 in
 the
 12
 months


leading
 to
 late
 2024,
 which
 signals
 a


widespread
 industry
 restructuring
 rather


than
 isolated
 corporate
 decisions.
 Now,


on
 to
 the
 major
 UK
 reductions
 and


company
 responses.
 Go-kartless
 reduced


its
 staff
 by
 20%
 in
 early
 2025,
 bringing


the
 staff
 size
 down
 from
 764
 to


approximately
 600
 since
 2023.
 Fintech


Unicorn
 Zeps
 cut
 about
 20%
 of
 its
 global


workforce,
 affecting
 around
 200


employees.
 Onfo's
 average
 headcount


dropped
 by
 19%
 to
 224
 employees
 as
 part


of
 an
 operational
 expense
 review.
 Tech


giants
 with
 significant
 UK
 operations,


including
 Meta,
 Amazon,
 and
 Microsoft


have
 all
 conducted
 substantial
 workforce


reductions
 as
 part
 of
 the
 global


restructuring
 efforts.
 Despite
 the


challenging
 employment
 landscape,
 the
 UK


sector
 has
 demonstrated
 remarkable


resilience
 in
 attracting
 investment,


maintaining
 its
 position
 as
 Europe's


leading
 tech
 hub.
 UK
 ranked
 as
 the


second
 highest
 funded
 tech
 ecosystem


globally
 in
 Q1
 2025,
 raising
 an


impressive
 $4.9
 billion,
 which
 is
 a
 44%


increase
 compared
 to
 Q4
 2024
 and
 26%


higher
 than
 Q1
 2024.
 This
 performance


placed
 the
 UK
 ahead
 of
 both
 Germany
 and


France
 combined
 with
 UK
 startups
 raising


similar
 funding
 to
 the
 total
 of
 Germany,


France,
 and
 Spain
 in
 the
 same
 period.


The
 United
 Kingdom
 has
 maintained
 its


position
 as
 Europe's
 leading
 destination


for
 foreign
 direct
 investment
 in


technology.
 Health
 and
 life
 sciences


startups
 emerged
 as
 the
 dominant


investment
 category
 in
 early
 2025,


raising
 1.8
 billion
 in
 Q1,
 more
 than


double
 the
 investment
 in
 any
 other


sector.
 Nearly
 half
 of
 all
 VC
 investment


in
 health
 and
 life
 sciences
 went
 to
 AI


powered
 startups,
 highlighting
 the


growing
 convergence
 of
 healthcare
 and


artificial
 intelligence.
 UK
 tech
 firms


overwhelmingly
 plan
 to
 invest
 in
 AI
 and


generative
 AI
 technologies
 with
 71%


prioritizing
 this
 area
 in
 2025


investment
 plans.
 onto
 the
 structural


changes
 in
 the
 UK
 tech
 ecosystem
 in
 the


post-pandemic
 era.
 There
 is
 a


significant
 transition
 from
 the
 growth


at
 all
 cost
 mentality
 that
 characterized


the
 pandemic
 boom
 years
 to
 a
 renewed


emphasis
 on
 profitability
 and


sustainable
 business
 models.
 And
 the


most
 perplexing
 trend
 is
 what
 might
 be


called
 the
 skills
 mismatch
 paradox.


Despite
 97%
 of
 tech
 businesses


implementing
 layoffs,
 75%
 report


difficulty
 recruiting
 staff
 with


appropriate
 skills.
 And
 lastly,
 onto
 the


not
 so
 obvious
 trends
 reshaping
 the
 UK


tech
 market.
 The
 Brexit
 talent
 effect.


The
 combination
 of
 Brexit
 and
 tech


layoffs
 has
 created
 a
 unique
 dynamic
 in


the
 UK
 labor
 market.
 Unlike
 the
 overall


job
 market,
 which
 has
 returned
 to
 the


prepandemic
 levels,
 tech
 hiring
 remains


down
 to
 approximately
 50%
 compared
 to


prepandemic
 figures.
 This
 suggests
 that


Brexit
 may
 be
 influencing
 tech
 companies


to
 invest
 and
 hire
 in
 EU
 countries
 where


they
 can
 attract
 talent
 from
 across
 the


block
 without
 complex
 visa
 processes.


Despite
 Brexit
 concerns
 and
 the
 layoff


wave,
 London
 has
 maintained
 its
 position


as
 the
 world's
 fourth
 ranked
 city
 for


tech
 VC
 investment
 behind
 only
 San


Francisco,
 Beijing,
 and
 New
 York
 and


remains
 Europe's
 number
 one
 tech
 hub.
 UK


tech
 firms
 adopted
 employing
 monitoring


tools
 at
 unprecedented
 rates
 with
 81%


using
 tracking
 technologies
 to
 combat


quiet
 vacationing
 and
 productivity


concerns.
 However,
 this
 approach
 created


a
 trust
 deficit.
 While
 61%
 of
 companies


reported
 improved
 morale
 from


monitoring,
 65%
 simultaneously
 expressed


concerns
 about
 long-term
 cultural


impacts.
 The
 sector
 now
 faces
 a
 delicate


balance
 between
 operational
 oversight


and
 preserving
 the
 autonomy
 that


initially
 made
 hybrid
 models
 attractive.


Postpandemic
 hiring
 sprees
 masked
 a


growing
 skills
 underutilization
 problem.


By
 2025,
 74%
 of
 UK
 tech
 employees


reported
 lacking
 opportunities
 to
 apply


their
 core
 competencies,
 leading
 to
 a


19%
 quiet
 quitting
 rate.
 While
 89%
 of
 UK


tech
 leaders
 invested
 in
 AI
 systems
 by


2025,
 only
 31%
 had
 retrained
 existing


staff
 to
 work
 with
 these
 tools.
 This


created
 a
 shadow
 skills
 gap
 where


employees
 watched
 their
 experience


become
 obsolete
 while
 companies


recruited
 externally
 for
 AI


capabilities.
 This
 resulting


disengagement
 contributed
 to
 a
 114%


increase
 in
 AI
 related
 turnover
 between


2024
 and
 2025.
 Quality
 of
 talent.
 The


UK's
 tech
 talent
 landscape
 is
 marked
 by


both
 exceptional
 quality
 and
 acute


scarcity.
 The
 country
 invests
 and


promotes
 high
 demand
 areas
 such
 as


artificial
 intelligence.
 They're
 very


big
 on
 cyber
 security
 and
 cloud


computing.
 But
 this
 very
 success
 has


fueled
 explosive
 demand
 for
 specialized


talent,
 outpacing
 the
 supply
 of
 skilled


professionals.
 Even
 with
 the
 UK's
 appeal


to
 international
 tech
 workers,
 the
 most


significant
 challenge
 is
 the
 chronic
 and


growing
 tech
 skill
 shortage,
 which
 is


worsened
 by
 the
 rapid
 acceleration
 in


demand
 for
 specialized
 skills,


particularly
 in
 fields
 that
 the
 UK
 is


investing
 so
 much
 money
 into.
 If
 what
 I


just
 said
 sounds
 contradicting
 to
 you,


because
 on
 one
 hand,
 the
 company's


investing
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 in
 these
 areas.


They're
 stimulating
 startups.
 They're


stimulating
 R&D.
 So,
 it
 may
 seem
 like,


well,
 if
 so
 many
 people
 got
 laid
 off,


what's
 your
 problem?
 You've
 got
 a


massive
 pool
 of
 available
 workforce.
 Why


not
 give
 them
 jobs?
 Well,
 it's
 not
 that


simple.
 We're
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 an
 AI


first
 transformation
 that
 is
 arguably


the
 most
 significant
 technological


revolution
 of
 our
 time.
 Unlike
 the


adoption
 of
 web
 2.0
 and
 the
 internet,


which
 unfolded
 gradually
 over
 decades,


AI
 is
 being
 integrated
 at
 an


unprecedented
 pace
 and
 scale.
 According


to
 McKenzie's
 2024
 global
 AI
 survey,


over
 70%
 of
 organizations
 worldwide
 have


adopted
 some
 form
 of
 AI,
 and
 the
 Gen
 AI


market
 alone
 is
 projected
 to
 exceed
 1.3


trillion
 by
 2032.
 The
 speed
 and
 breadth


of
 AI's
 impact
 far
 surpass
 previous


digital
 revolutions,
 fundamentally


reshaping
 industries,
 economies,
 and
 the


future
 of
 work
 in
 real
 time.
 And
 on
 top


of
 that,
 there
 is
 another
 paradox.


Despite
 widespread
 adoption,
 69%
 of


organizations
 had
 yet
 to
 see
 measurable


returns
 from
 their
 AI
 projects.
 The


disconnect
 between
 the
 enthusiasm
 and


outcomes
 is
 stark,
 and
 the
 gap
 lies
 in


execution
 rather
 than
 ambition.
 I
 urge


you
 to
 read
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 OpenAI's


2024
 profitability
 analysis.
 Here's
 the


report
 that
 was
 widely
 discussed
 in


various
 data
 science
 communities
 last


year,
 published
 by
 the
 company
 called


Future
 Research
 in
 June
 2024,
 claiming


that
 only
 15%
 of
 OpenAI's
 revenue
 came


from
 API
 usage.
 Now,
 I
 got
 to
 say
 that


when
 this
 report
 was
 produced,
 it
 was
 an


estimate,
 an
 unofficial
 estimate,
 and


the
 data
 sources
 used
 for
 this
 report


have
 been
 questioned
 by
 many.
 Other


resources
 such
 as
 industry
 newsletters


and
 financial
 breakdowns
 estimated
 the


API
 share
 to
 be
 between
 15
 and
 27%.


Later,
 in
 September
 2024,
 the


information
 reported
 a
 leak
 from
 OpenAI


and
 it
 suggested
 that
 the
 API
 revenue


estimate
 published
 by
 the
 future


research
 3
 months
 prior
 was
 fairly


accurate.
 Now,
 of
 course,
 these
 data


points
 are
 unofficial
 and
 the
 OpenAI
 has


not
 disclosed
 the
 revenue.
 Nevertheless,


if
 you
 choose
 to
 believe
 these
 findings,


and
 15
 to
 20%
 of
 OpenAI's
 revenue
 is


attributed
 to
 APIs,
 there's
 your
 proof


that
 even
 though
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 hype


and
 enthusiasm,
 we're
 still
 far
 from


mass
 adoption
 and
 complete
 integration


of
 artificial
 intelligence
 into


businesses.
 Domestic
 training
 and


education
 efforts
 are
 underway,
 but
 have


not
 yet
 produced
 enough
 homegrown
 talent


to
 meet
 immediate
 needs.
 As
 a
 result,


despite
 being
 a
 global
 magnet
 for
 tech


talent,
 the
 UK
 still
 faces
 intense


competition
 for
 a
 limited
 pool
 of


qualified
 professionals,
 both
 from


within
 the
 country
 and
 internationally,


leading
 to
 many
 roles
 remaining


unfilled.
 As
 I
 was
 doing
 the
 research


for
 this
 video,
 I
 came
 across
 some
 very


interesting
 data
 about
 the
 British


education
 system,
 which
 I
 personally


didn't
 know
 about
 before.
 There
 are
 a


few
 reasons
 why
 the
 UK
 is
 experiencing
 a


skills
 gap.
 Number
 one,
 low
 uptake
 in


schools.
 STEM
 subject
 participation


remains
 a
 challenge.
 Only
 a
 small


proportion
 of
 students
 in
 England
 pursue


STEM
 subjects
 beyond
 age
 16.
 Many


schools
 over
 half
 in
 some
 regions
 do
 not


offer
 computer
 science
 courses,
 limiting


early
 exposure
 to
 technical
 fields.


Regional
 and
 socioeconomic
 disparities


persist
 with
 disadvantaged
 areas
 seeing


fewer
 students
 achieve
 highle
 STEM


qualifications.
 The
 government
 continues


to
 fund
 adult
 education
 and
 tailored


programs
 for
 learners
 age
 19
 and
 over.


There
 are
 a
 variety
 of
 paid
 programs
 and


free
 training
 opportunities
 in
 IT,
 data,


and
 technology.
 However,
 completion


rates
 and
 alignment
 with
 industry
 is


still
 below
 what
 the
 government
 is


expecting.
 The
 government
 has
 invested


significantly
 in
 STEM
 teaching
 and


inclusion
 initiatives
 such
 as
 the


programs
 to
 support
 girls
 in


mathematics.
 Women
 currently
 comprise


only
 15.7%
 as
 of
 March
 2025
 of
 UK


engineers,
 which
 is
 down
 from
 16.5%
 in


2023.
 Nevertheless,
 despite
 increased


government
 investment
 and
 new
 industry


partnerships,
 England's
 domestic
 STEM


and
 technical
 education
 pipeline
 is
 not


yet
 meeting
 demand.
 Low
 school
 uptake,


regional
 and
 socioeconomic
 disparities,


and
 persistent
 diversity
 issues
 continue


to
 limit
 the
 supply
 of
 homegrown


technical
 talent,
 leaving
 the
 UK
 reliant


on
 both
 imported
 expertise
 and
 ongoing


educational
 reform
 to
 bridge
 the
 gap.


The
 vibe.


The
 UK
 fintech
 sector
 has
 generated


billions
 in
 revenue
 and
 it's
 home
 to


nearly
 a
 quarter
 of
 Europe's
 fintech


unicorns
 and
 employs
 more
 people
 than


the
 tech
 sector
 in
 Singapore,
 Hong
 Kong,


Australia
 combined.
 The
 UK
 and
 London
 in


particular
 has
 the
 largest
 tech


ecosystem
 in
 Europe.
 Home
 to
 global


companies
 and
 vibrant
 startup
 scene,
 it


is
 a
 powerhouse
 in
 fintech
 and
 cyber


security
 offering
 some
 of
 the
 highest


tech
 salaries
 on
 the
 continent.
 The
 city


also
 provides
 fantastic
 networking


opportunities,
 frequent
 industry
 events,


and
 significant
 career
 mobility.


However,
 the
 benefits
 come
 at
 a
 price.


London
 has
 the
 highest
 cost
 of
 living


and
 housing
 in
 the
 UK
 and
 one
 of
 the


highest
 in
 Europe.
 The
 job
 market
 is


intensely
 competitive.
 The
 pace
 is
 fast


and
 long
 commutes
 are
 common.


Manchester,
 the
 UK's
 second
 largest
 tech


hub,
 boasts
 a
 fast
 growing
 digital


economy.
 While
 salaries
 here
 are
 lower


than
 in
 London,
 the
 cost
 of
 living
 is


definitely
 more
 affordable.
 The
 city


supports
 a
 strong
 startup
 and
 e-commerce


scene.
 Nevertheless,
 despite
 the
 growth,


Manchester
 doesn't
 host
 nearly
 as
 many


global
 headquarters
 as
 London.


Cambridge.
 Cambridge
 is
 internationally


renowned
 for
 its
 strengths
 in
 research,


biotech,
 and
 deep
 tech.
 It's
 home
 to


major
 players
 like
 Google,
 Microsoft,


Amazon,
 and
 a
 range
 of
 top
 tier


startups.
 It
 has
 very
 strong
 academic


and
 startup
 culture,
 and
 it
 is
 ideal
 for


roles
 focused
 on
 R&D.
 Nevertheless,
 the


housing
 costs
 are
 high
 relative
 to
 the


city
 size.
 There
 is
 one
 more
 trend
 when


it
 comes
 to
 the
 vibe.
 There
 is
 a


noticeable
 trend
 of
 UK
 tech


professionals
 exploring
 opportunities


abroad,
 specifically
 within
 the
 UAE
 and


Saudi
 Arabia.
 The
 UAE's
 tech
 sector
 is


promising
 growth
 in
 areas
 such
 as


artificial
 intelligence,
 cyber
 security,


and
 data
 analytics
 with
 significant


government
 investments
 in
 initiatives


such
 as
 the
 UAE
 AI
 strategy
 2031
 and


Smart
 Dubai
 2030.
 However,
 I'd
 like
 to


warn
 everybody
 that
 not
 everything
 that


glitters
 is
 gold.
 Check
 out
 my
 video


about
 the
 post-pandemic
 and
 post
 layoff


tax
 scene
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.
 The
 UAE's


ambition
 to
 become
 an
 AI
 powered
 economy


by
 2030
 combined
 with
 aggressive


recruitment
 and
 investment
 is
 drawing


attention
 from
 the
 UK
 talent
 that
 is


seeking
 challenges
 and
 higher


compensation
 without
 brutal
 taxation.


Cost
 of
 living.
 When
 it
 comes
 to
 cost
 of


living,
 the
 differences
 across
 UK
 tech


cities
 are
 pretty
 stark.
 While
 some


places
 offer
 more
 balance
 and


affordability,
 other
 trade
 higher
 pay


for
 higher
 expenses.
 Take
 a
 moment
 to


compare
 housing,
 lifestyle
 costs,
 and


what
 your
 salary
 actually
 gets
 you
 in


each
 city
 because
 sometimes
 the
 best
 job


offer
 on
 paper
 does
 not
 go
 nearly
 as
 far


once
 you
 factor
 in
 rent
 and
 everything


else.
 Once
 again,
 this
 data
 is
 based
 on


expenses
 of
 a
 mid
 to
 senior
 tech
 worker


such
 as
 a
 data
 scientist,
 product


manager,
 or
 a
 software
 developer.
 I
 do


not
 take
 into
 account
 things
 like
 family


expenses
 because
 those
 can
 vary
 wildly.


Conclusion.
 So,
 where
 does
 this
 leave


us?
 The
 UK
 tech
 scene
 in
 2025
 is


essentially
 two
 contradictory
 stories


happening
 simultaneously.
 On
 one
 hand,


you
 have
 a
 matured
 ecosystem
 that's


produced
 some
 of
 the
 world's
 most


innovative
 companies.
 From
 the
 ARM


processors
 in
 your
 phone
 to
 the
 fintech


apps
 revolutionizing
 how
 we
 bank.
 On
 the


other
 hand,
 you
 have
 a
 system
 struggling


to
 keep
 pace
 with
 its
 own
 success.
 The


layoffs
 aren't
 just
 about
 economic


cycles.
 They're
 symptoms
 of
 a
 deeper


transformation.
 We're
 witnessing
 the


growing
 pains
 of
 an
 industry
 caught


between
 the
 old
 world
 of
 move
 fast
 and


break
 things
 and
 the
 new
 reality
 of
 show


me
 the
 ROI.
 Meanwhile,
 the
 skills
 gap


isn't
 just
 about
 the
 numbers.
 It's
 about


the
 fundamental
 mismatch
 between
 what


schools
 are
 teaching
 the
 existing
 skill


set
 of
 the
 tech
 force
 and
 what
 the
 AI


first
 economy
 actually
 needs.
 And
 that's


a
 wrap
 for
 the
 UK.
 Next
 up
 is


Switzerland.
 Please
 give
 us
 a
 thumbs
 up


and
 subscribe
 to
 stay
 tuned.
 As
 always,


I
 hope
 this
 was
 helpful.
 Till
 next
 time.


Bye.
