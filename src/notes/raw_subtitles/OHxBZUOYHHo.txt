Hello everyone, I'm Anthony
Welcome to my channel
Today's program
Let's talk about an interesting topic
This is the deep motivation behind NTR fantasy and cuckold literature
Just a few days ago
Discussed this topic with a netizen
She is a researcher engaged in feminist theory
PhD in Sociology
I recently encountered a topic
That's why
NTR theme
It occupies a very important position in Japanese AV
I think our conversation was of great quality.
So today I want to talk about this topic in depth
Of course, I think the depth of this topic
It goes far beyond Japanese adult films
This narrow area
It actually reflects a universal spiritual structure
Those who are familiar with our channel know
I'm not one to make moral judgments.
If a person has such preferences and fantasies
Then I don't mean to prohibit or advise
What we are pursuing here
Just to restore this mental state as realistically as possible
I will post this video
Put it in the list of "Psychology and Education"
If you have anything you want to discuss with me
and consultation topics
You can contact my email to make an appointment
First, let’s explain the term
The so-called NTR is the abbreviation of the Japanese word "床取られ"
Literally, I was slept away.
That is what we say in Chinese
A man is cuckolded
So NTR can also be called cuckold literature
In this kind of story
Core experiencer and pleasure gainer
Not the man and woman having sex in the story
But the partner who witnessed him
Taken away by others
The male protagonist who violated
In Japanese adult films
NTR theme has several very classic scenes
The most original version is that the male protagonist is an honest
Thin people
One day his wife was suddenly taken away by a group of bad youths.
Or a fierce stranger is staring at you.
They threaten the life of the man or his wife
The male protagonist is weak because of his mental and physical weakness.
Not daring to resist or failing to resist
Can only witness his girlfriend or wife being violated
The wife resisted at first.
But under coercion, I gradually got used to and adapted to it.
Even start to enjoy or even become obsessed with each other
Another classic scene is
The male protagonist is an ordinary employee of the company
Facing the risk of layoffs
Wife to keep her husband's job
Or for the husband to be promoted smoothly in the workplace
Having to have sex with her husband's boss
The husband had no choice but to acquiesce in despair and helplessness.
The core here is no longer the disparity in physical strength
It's the imbalance of social status and power.
In addition to the above scenarios
NTR also has a very special subspecies
It's the mother-son relationship
The protagonist of the story
Usually a single mother and son
In order to raise enough money for her son's high tuition
Or earn a living
Having to commit to a rich and powerful man
For example, the principal of a school, the boss of a company
Or a rich person
In this process
The son is always aware
He might be hiding behind the door and watching all this.
Spy on the mother's sacrifice for herself
Feeling sad, angry, humiliated
At the same time, a strong sense of excitement
No matter how the external forms of these scenes change
There are several things in common
First of all, the male protagonist is an absolute weakling
Whether it's physical, economic or psychological
All powerless
He could only watch it all happen.
Secondly, the female characters in the story
Whether it's a girlfriend, wife or mother
It's all for the male lead
Sacrifice your own
They make the male protagonist feel a
A twisted pleasure mixed with the sublime and touching
Although women were reluctant at first
But they finally enjoyed and acquiesced
This further highlights the male protagonist's failure, incompetence and humiliation
Logically speaking
This should be painful for a man.
Sexual fantasies of anger and humiliation
But why in these works
He became the path to excitement.
Why do many Asian men
Immersed in this fantasy
Some might consider this preference
Due to the proliferation of Japanese AV
But I think there's a deeper reason.
At least in China
Many men have never seen adult films before
Their sense of masculinity
has been replaced by a more grand
Pre-shaped by more everyday narratives
AV just provides a ready-made script
And what really makes this script
Able to be immersed in the play by a large audience
and resonate with
They have already deep in their hearts
The psychological stage has been set
This grand narrative
It's China's nationalist propaganda.
We talk about China's nationalist propaganda
It is full of NTR plots
About this topic
In this video from last September,
Also mentioned
That is China's history education
When describing the relationship between foreign countries and China
Extensive use of anthropomorphic metaphors of sexual assault
By personifying the land and the nation as women
For example, Motherland, Girl, etc.
Comparing hostile forces to perpetrators of sexual assault
Lose the country
Metaphor for women losing their chastity, etc.
This stimulates the audience's sense of shame
We also focused on analyzing Fang Zhimin's articles
Lovely China
In this article
Fang Zhimin first compared China to an elegant
Beautiful mother and
Describing her body in sexualized language
The second role is imperialism as an aggressor
Fang Zhimin used terrifying and exaggerated language
Imperialism
Described as a demon full of primitive bestiality
They are pure violent pleasure machines
However, in this story
There is a third character
That is the readers and viewers
Fang Zhimin repeatedly called out: "Friends
Look, do you see it?"
Trying to pull the reader into a helpless
Snooper's location
That is the one in Japanese AV
The male protagonist who witnessed all this from behind the door
Although Fang Zhimin's article
Officially defined as a patriotic text
But at the unconscious level
He secretly created a classic NTR
psychological structure
Fang Zhimin did not preach
But through
Constructing a traumatic fantasy scenario
In the reader's heart, patriotism and mother love are combined
Combine the pleasure of voyeurism with humiliation, hatred and jealousy
Tie it up tightly
This kind of voyeurism
In Chinese society, it is not only completely legal
Even considered noble and sacred by the government
History Education in China
For example, various exhibitions with the theme of anti-Japanese war
Or in various anti-Japanese dramas
Exaggerating and depicting the invaders
Sexual assault on women in the country
It is an indispensable part
However, this depiction and exposure
It's not pointing to
Empathy and understanding for the female victims themselves
Their own stories are blurred and anonymous
Even omitted
Focus of publicity
Focus mainly on the cruelty of the perpetrator
and details of the victimization process
The purpose is to stimulate the audience's preset political emotions
These women's trauma is no longer their own
It is used to ignite ethnic hatred
And the flames of revenge
A typical case is children
Anti-Japanese War drama "Little Soldier Zhang Ga"
Tong the shopkeeper in the play
Representing the centrists in that troubled time
In today's terms, he is a day-to-day person, a quiet person.
He plays both sides and
He thinks that as long as he is smooth enough
Just live your own life
Therefore, although he also caters to the Japanese
But mainly to make more money
However
In the end, the Japanese officer still violated his wife
At the same time, two Japanese soldiers held down his body.
Force him to watch
As the intense and tragic background music sounded
This sexual assault scene
It was elevated into a moment reflecting national hatred and family feuds.
Tong the shopkeeper's spirit completely collapsed
After this
He finally gave up his centrist illusions
But was completely forced
The revolutionary path of resisting the war to the end
NTR Episodes
Became a booster for his character transformation
As for his wife
In the play from beginning to end, he is a tool
she
Just the objects of desire of men in the play
Why
This plot has no respect for women at all.
There is another plot in the play
that is
When his wife came out of the Japanese officer's room
When I ask him for help
Tong's first reaction was to yell that she was dirty.
Then walked away
We need to know
The ratings of this drama were very high at that time.
And it's largely for children.
But the TV series is about this behavior
There is no criticism
This explains the TV series
Or China's nationalist education
Encouraged
It's actually a rather distorted masculinity.
As long as the parties are inspired to hate
Just take the revolutionary path
As for sympathy and understanding for women
It is totally unnecessary
therefore
Despite repeated exaggeration and emphasis by Chinese officials
comfort women
The fact of victimization
But on a practical level
This group
More as a tool to blame Japan
Despite the high-profile commemoration of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression by the government for many years
The anti-Japanese sentiment among the people is also becoming stronger and stronger
However, their own situation
Basically no one cares
Even they were harmed by the Chinese
More
The later years of Chinese comfort women are generally bleak
Many people blamed them for not committing suicide.
Why live a miserable life?
Of course, this mentality is not unique to China.
In post-World War II France
Many men
Also those women who had slept with German officers
Pulled out and paraded through the streets
This shows
When male groups face stronger enemies
When you experience a profound sense of castration
They will turn their violence against the weaker
To make a pathological compensation
In an attempt to regain his lost male dignity
certainly
France and Germany shortly after the war
National reconciliation was achieved
The special thing about China is that
This kind of psychological trauma of the Chinese people
It actually has little to do with that history.
But they are educated by their own country's patriotism
The result of repeated and systematic shaping
It is in the male mind
Creates a weak
Identifying with the castrated male self
So Chinese society also has sex education.
Rather than what is generally believed
Sex is a taboo in Chinese education
It's just that this is a very toxic sex education
When a boy
The earliest and most profound impressions of sex and passion
Not from healthy love
But it comes from "wife and mother being violated
As a member of this nation, I can do nothing.”
The grand narrative
His desire structure was distorted from the beginning
He will unconsciously think
The strongest emotional experience is necessarily associated with power imbalance.
violence, humiliation
Sacrifice and other heavy things are linked together
In the official ideology
imperialism
The great powers are always in the hearts of Chinese men.
A lingering shadow
A powerful other
And myself
is a natural, structural loser
He was constantly reinforced with a sense of humiliation,
Low self-esteem
But this is not a foreign import.
When they encounter similar events again in real life
For example, easy girl
That ancient trauma and stress response
It was activated instantly
They need to
verbal abuse and slut-shaming
To cleanse the deep within my heart
The trauma of being castrated by ideology
Of course this is futile.
As Lacan argues
The object of desire can never truly satisfy the desire itself
Because the object of desire is only a substitute
It is ideology
Make a person think that what he wants
In the scene of easy girl
This target is those who have relationships with foreign men
Or those girls walking down the street in kimono
Netizens believe
He is the cause of his own pain and humiliation
Therefore, as long as you can criticize and punish the other party
One's own male dignity
It's like getting some kind of repair.
However
This is a huge misconception
The real cause
It's the ideology that suppresses and restrains them.
It is this ideology
In their hearts
Creates a traumatic void
An anxiety that has nowhere to go
This void
Slide from one object to another
For example, capitalists who worship foreign things and public intellectuals, etc.
No external objects
Can truly fill this fundamental lack
Faced with this scarcity
Official ideology
or the symbolic order
In fact, it provides individuals with a seemingly correct way out
That is to say, knowing shame and then being brave
This is an officially recognized path to sublimation
It calls upon the subject:
The humiliation and powerlessness you feel are valid.
Now you should turn this shame into motivation
Strive for the rejuvenation of the country and the nation
You should be a capable
A real man who meets the standards
A Chinese
When you've done all this
Not only will you gain wealth
You will also gain the love of the opposite sex
In this mainstream narrative
Women are like trophies
It is something that only the powerful or the powerful class can possess.
then
He also tends to imagine women as a kind of material
Money-worshipping people who constantly ask for money from him
Arrogant existence
Follow whoever is stronger
Therefore, he believes
My problem is that I am not strong enough
Once you have power and wealth
You will never lack the opposite sex to like you again
He rarely thinks
I can understand and empathize with women
To build intimacy
Because of women's perspectives and feelings
It basically doesn't exist in this narrative.
However, many men find in reality
This path of knowing shame and then being brave
It's basically impossible
On the one hand
The shadow of the powerful other is always lingering
For example, the privileged class and the wealthy class in reality
Still makes them feel more depressed
More importantly
The castrated inferior identity
Has been deeply internalized
This led them to
Lack of confidence and motivation to become a strong person
It is easier to feel
Totally denied
There is also a lack of understanding and trust
To gain the ability to appreciate the opposite sex
So he might become more likely to hate women.
They are caught in a painful dilemma
He can neither become the
The successful man
Unable to resist
Or escape from the order that constantly commands him to succeed
This brought deeper pain and anxiety
in this case
NTR Fantasy
It becomes an alternative compensation strategy
I'm a little tired today
Let's stop here for now.
