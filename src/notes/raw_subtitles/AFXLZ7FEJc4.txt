- [Derek] What happens if I heat up
this rubber band?
When you heat materials
like glass or plastic,
the atoms vibrate faster.
They get slightly farther apart
and this reduces intermolecular forces.
So the material gets weaker.
Under tension, it stretches.
But when I heat up this rubber
band, the opposite happens.
It actually pulls more strongly.
The rubber band contracts
and the weight goes up.
So why does this happen?
Well, rubber is unlike any other material.
It's waterproof.
As it's breaking, it
actually becomes tougher
and it can stretch up
to 10 times its length
and bounce back no worse for wear.
These properties have made
it essential for modern life.
It forms the tubes and seals
that carry our gas and water,
the belts that drive our motors
and the tires on our
cars, trucks and planes.
Even trains use rubber in
their suspension systems.
It's a perfectly engineered material
but we didn't invent it.
All of our most durable rubber
still comes from a single natural source.
This tree, it's a source
at risk of being wiped out.
And if that happens, the
results could be devastating.
- You're talking about a complete
global societal meltdown.
- This could be considered
a national security issue.
- You wouldn't think that we're
so dependent on this thing?
- Well, we are, and most
people don't know that.
They're waiting for a disaster to happen.
- [Derek] Rubber comes from
the Brazilian rubber tree.
As early as 1600 BC,
Mesoamericans cut the bark
to release this milky white liquid,
now known as latex.
They noticed that if they let it dry,
it turned into this stretchy,
waterproof solid lump.
To see this in person,
we sent Veritasium producer
and mechanical engineer, Henry van Dyck
to the Akron Research and
Development Laboratory,
where they specialize
in all things rubber.
- In just all these racks,
even though they look solid,
they're all flowing right now.
- Really?
- If you look
behind one of these racks,
you can see these are actually dripping.
- Oh, wow.
- They're flowing slower
than we can perceive.
- [Derek] Unprocessed
rubber is not the rubber
we're used to.
It slowly flows and
can't maintain its shape.
So how do you get this weird
material in the first place?
Well, just underneath the bark
are special tube-like cells
that carry the latex.
Floating around inside are lots
of isopentenyl pyrophosphate or IPP.
This is the building block
or monomer of rubber.
In fact, IPP is found
everywhere in nature,
including inside you.
- Huge amounts of us
are dependent upon that little molecule.
We make short chain rubber in our livers.
It's called Dolichol.
You're busily making rubber,
you are a rubber factory.
- How? What do you mean?
Why am I making rubber?
- It's essential for cell membranes.
- [Henry] Special builder
enzymes grab these monomers
to build this long chain
with over 10,000 monomers,
they build a polymer.
This is rubber.
- So I get students to think
about if this is a carbon atom
and then I've got my next carbon atom
along the chain next to it, yeah?
And then, I've got my next carbon atom.
How many do we have
to make up the whole length of the chain?
Well, we've got tens of
thousands, hundreds of thousands
of carbons along the back burn.
You start going kilometers in distance
from end to end if each atom is the size
of this tennis ball.
- [Derek] But the polymers
aren't stretched out
from end to end like that.
Instead, they're all coiled up.
- If you imagine the room
that I'm in right now
and I had the first
ball here in the middle,
the chances of the end of
the chain leaving this room
is quite small.
- [Derek] So after you've
dried out the latex,
you're left with raw rubber, a
jumble of all these polymers.
And this is why it's flowing.
Because over time,
all those polymers slowly
slide past each other.
Now, when you pull on
the rubber and let go,
it bounces back.
So why is this?
- At room temperature,
rubber's polymer chains
are constantly vibrating
and bumping into each other.
And other smaller molecules
like air molecules
or trapped water molecules
also jostle around
and bump into the chains.
Now, when you stretch rubber,
these chains straighten out.
But as you're doing this,
those chains are still being bombarded
by these smaller molecules.
So when you release that stress,
there's nothing holding
those chains aligned anymore.
And the constant bombardment
from the smaller molecules
and the other chains
kinks those chains back up.
So the rubber snaps back
to its original size.
And if you heat the rubber up,
well then, everything is vibrating faster
and so the chains are gonna
get kinked up even more
so the rubber pulls back stronger.
- [Derek] This is why
when you heat up rubber,
it shrinks.
- Rubber band's fascinating.
To think that when they're sitting
on an old package of
papers for a long time
holding those papers together,
it's done by a perpetual
pounding, pounding, pounding
of the atoms against
these chains to hold it,
trying to kink them and
trying to kink them.
- [Derek] But there's also another reason
why rubber is so stretchy.
If you zoom in on a chain,
you'll see that the monomers
are attached to each other
on the same side of the double bond.
This is called cis-attachment.
And it affects how the chain folds.
On each monomer, there
are three single bonds
that can rotate to be
at an angle or in line
but these carbons with two
hydrogens take up a lot of space.
So it's favorable for at
least one of these bonds
to be at an angle.
That makes the polymer wiggle in and out
like a folded ribbon.
So when you pull on a piece of rubber,
first, all the polymers line up
but then, each chain also unfolds.
The wiggle makes rubber extra stretchy.
But this state is very rare.
All three bonds lined up is
only one possible arrangement
for any monomer.
And one polymer usually
has thousands of monomers.
So after you release the stress,
the chain goes from an improbable state,
completely aligned to a more
probable one, with wiggles.
The chain itself bounces back.
This is where rubber
gets its elasticity from.
So natural rubbers straight from the tree
is already stretchy.
It's also waterproof
since all those chains
are just a bunch of
carbon and hydrogen atoms
which are hydrophobic.
But as we've seen, it
eventually loses its shape.
Plus, if you stretch it too much,
it breaks quite easily.
So we need to do more to get
the rubber we're used to today.
Early Mesoamericans
improved the rubber slightly
by mixing the latex
with juice from the tropical
morning-glory, a local flower.
And they used this to form
sandals, bottles and balls.
- But for the next 3,000 years
to the rest of the world,
rubber was little more than a curiosity.
Then in 1770, a piece of natural latex
made its way to English
chemist, Joseph Priestley.
And he took this piece
and used it to try to erase pencil marks.
He noticed that it easily,
quote, "rubbed them away."
- [Derek] In the following decades,
people started exploring
other applications.
Up until then, people
used to waterproof fabric
with oil, wax, or tar.
But some oils were extremely flammable
and prone to spontaneous combustion.
And wax or tar would
eventually crack with movement.
Similarly, there were no
real good flexible materials
at the time.
Leather was the best option
but it had little give.
Rubber had the potential
to fix all those problems.
So for the next 50 years,
the use of rubber exploded.
In England, people made
waterproof clothing.
And by the late 1820s,
the rubber craze hit the US
when everyone wanted their own pair
of Brazilian waterproof boots.
Factories sprung up all across the country
to make new rubber products,
including one New England factory
called the Roxbury India Rubber Company.
- In the spring of 1834,
things were looking great for the company.
The previous fall,
they had sold over $20,000 worth of goods,
rubber coats, shoes and the like.
But as the summer came round,
problems started to emerge.
- They used to rubberize the fabric
to make it water-resistant
which was fine until you sat down
on a wooden bench on a hot
day and you stuck to it.
- [Derek] See, all natural rubber
has a critical weakness.
It's extremely sensitive
to temperature changes.
It melts when it gets too hot
and it freezes and becomes
brittle when it gets too cold.
- This made the coats and
shoes practically useless
during the hot summer.
So customers returned their items on mass.
Then, things went from bad to worse.
One day, the Roxbury manager
visited the warehouse.
When he opened the door,
he didn't see their newest products.
Instead, he was met with a foul smell
and a molten, gooey mess that
covered the entire warehouse.
- In fact, when we
ordered some raw rubber,
we were in for a similar nasty surprise.
Oh, that is disgusting.
The summer heat melted
their rubber products
and they started rotting.
The sludge stank so badly,
the manager had the employees
secretly bury it at night.
- [Derek] But later
in that horrible summer,
the manager got a visit
from a man named Charles.
Charles' previous
business had gone bankrupt
and he was deeply in debt.
- He stumbled upon a rubber life preserver
and he thought he could
make a better valve.
He pitched the Roxbury
manager on his new design,
hoping to pay back his lenders.
The manager was impressed but
couldn't buy Charles' work.
He showed Charles the warehouse
full of rotten rubber.
Rubber had potential
but in its current form,
it was just too problematic.
However, he said if
anyone could figure out
how to make rubber stable
in a wider temperature range
and non-sticky, well, then
that person would stand
to make a ton of money.
So Charles was determined
to become that person.
But when he returned home
to start his experiments,
he was met by an angry creditor
who threw Charles into debtor's
prison for unpaid loans.
Charles asked his wife
to bring him raw rubber
and her rolling pin.
There in his jail cell,
he started adding different
compounds into raw rubber.
- If rubber was naturally sticky,
then why couldn't you add dry powders
to absorb that stickiness?
So he tried adding magnesia
and he got a smooth non-sticky rubber.
But over time, the stickiness returned.
After his release,
he tested the wear and tear
of his rubber compounds
by walking around in all rubber outfits.
- [Henry] His hands were always covered
with gum elastic.
He playfully said that the
only way to rub rubber off
was by rubbing more on.
- Some mixtures showed promise,
but eventually, they'd all
rot into a sticky mess.
So he kept borrowing money
to fund his experiments
but because his mixtures
all eventually failed,
he ended up in debtor's
prison so many times
that he jokingly called it his hotel.
But Charles refused to give up.
When a friend told him rubber is dead,
Charles replied, "I am
the man to bring it back."
In the summer of 1838,
he met Nathaniel Hayward,
a businessman and inventor.
Hayward had done his own
experiments with rubber.
At one point, he laid
out a sheet of rubber
and sprinkled on sulfur powder.
And when he let this sheet set in the sun,
he noticed that it hardened
and had a smooth and non-sticky surface.
- But eventually, it would
still melt in the heat
and freeze in the cold. He offered his
process to his previous company
but it was so horribly
smelly that they rejected it.
But Charles saw the possibilities.
So he helped Hayward get a patent
and then he bought it
so that he could use it
in his own experiments.
Then one day in the winter of 1839,
Charles accidentally
dropped a piece of rubber
mixed with sulfur on a hot stove.
When he went to scrape it off,
he found that instead of melting,
it had charred and hardened.
His daughter later said,
"As I was passing in and out of the room,
I casually observed the
little piece of gum,"
which he was holding near the fire.
And he was unusually
animated by some discovery
which he had made.
He nailed the piece of gum
outside the kitchen door
in the intense cold.
In the morning, he brought it
in, holding it up exultingly.
He had found it perfectly flexible
as it was when he put it out.
- So he had made a new rubber
with completely different properties,
one that seemed to be
temperature-resistant
and much stronger.
In fact, we're going to
test out unprocessed rubber
against rubber processed in this way.
- Okay, so this is uncured rubber
and I'm gonna see how far I can pull it.
Uncured rubber is very soft
and stretches really far
before easily breaking.
Oh, oh, it's gonna hurt, ah!
We need to cure it.
- What does it smell like to you?
- Smells like a barbecue.
- This smells like a barbecue.
- The smell of rubber does
not seem to be natural.
- Mm.
- Like it smells very chemically
like it was made in the factory.
- Yeah, so when I was in the factory
and I saw the natural rubber,
it smelled just like a barbecue.
And the reason is they take
the sap from the rubber tree
which is latex and then they smoke it.
- [Derek] They're smoking it?
- [Henry] Yeah.
- Like you'd smoke some salmon?
- Yeah.
- They smoke the rubber sheets
to get rid of excess moisture
and to preserve it by
getting rid of the bacteria.
This gives most natural rubber
a sort of brownish color.
So step one, add the rub.
- [Barry] One at a time.
- [Henry] Next, you add several
powders including sulfur.
Everything is mixed and heated
to get a much stronger rubber.
- Just pull it, straight off.
- Yeah, that's wild.
Yeah, no.
- Pretty tough.
- It is tough, eh?
Now, yeah, now it's
like wicked hard, yeah.
Now at 393 kilopascals,
the uncured rubber broke after
extending just under 900%
of its original length.
At the same stress,
the cured rubber had
only stretched around 5%.
It eventually broke at 14.1 megapascals
after stretching nearly
600% of its original length.
So what was it about sulfur and heat
that changed the
properties so dramatically?
Well, chemically, sulfur powder
is just rings of eight sulfur atoms.
On the hot stove, the
sulfur ring broke apart
into smaller pieces.
And now, those sulfur
atoms or sulfur chains
have free bonding sites
so they look for places to attach.
What likely happened is they
grabbed onto a carbon atom
from a rubber chain,
breaking its double bond
and attached itself.
Then with another free bonding site,
it grabbed onto a carbon atom
from a different rubber chain,
breaking its double bond
and linking the two
rubber chains together.
This cross-linking forms flexible bridges
of one, two or even more
sulfur atoms in a row.
Now, think about what
this does to the rubber.
Instead of each chain being loose
and slippery like spaghetti,
they're tied together in a
flexible but connected network.
So now, if rubber sits out in
the sun on a hot summer's day,
the tight bonds prevent it from melting.
And in the cold, the
cross-links make it harder
for the rubber to fully freeze
so it's less brittle and harder to break.
And when you pull on the rubber,
the chains stretch just as before.
But as you release it,
everything returns to
its original position
because it's all connected.
So the cross-links make
the rubber stronger,
more resistant to temperature
changes and more elastic.
In fact, by tweaking the
number and properties
of these cross-links,
you can change the properties of rubber.
If you have a lot of cross-links,
all the rubber chains are
bound tightly together
so the rubber becomes harder and stiffer.
Great for things like shoe soles and tires
that need to be durable but
still a little flexible.
If you have shorter cross-links,
each link is harder to break.
So the rubber is more resistant
to heat and weathering.
This is useful for seals and insulators.
And if you have longer cross-links,
the rubber chains can move more freely,
so you can stretch it
more before it breaks.
That's perfect in the medical field
for soft and flexible applications.
So the cross-links are
essential to stabilizing rubber.
When Hayward sprinkled sulfur powder
on rubber sheets,
the heat from the sun did
cause some cross-linking
but only on the surface.
When Charles kneaded in sulfur
and then heated the entire mixture,
the cross-links grew
throughout the entire sample.
So now, the results were much better.
Eventually, this process
was called vulcanisation
after the Roman God, Vulcan,
who was associated with heat
and sulfur in volcanoes.
Over the next five years,
Charles perfected his
method of vulcanisation.
And then he patented it in 1844.
With this, he transformed
rubber from a curiosity
into a material of endless possibilities.
Little did he know
that he actually wasn't
the first to discover it.
The Mayans or the Aztecs
used, like, created rubber
where they also vulcanising
rubber, or was this the-?
- They actually were.
- In fact, Charles' discovery
was very similar to what the Mesoamericans
had been doing for thousands of years.
They'd taken the juice
from the morning-glory
which contained sulfur,
mixed it with natural latex,
and then by laying it out
in the sun, it would heat up
and actually naturally
create the cross-links
that he'd discovered in his kitchen.
Why did the Europeans, like,
why did they have to
reinvent the whole thing?
Why didn't they just ask them?
- Well,
they hadn't even noticed, I don't think.
- No.
In the decades after Charles's invention,
tons and tons of products were invented
or improved with rubber.
- [Announcer] Richards makes bold claim
he could cross Pacific in this outfit.
- [Derek] The inflatable
bicycle tire arrived in 1888,
the first rubber gloves for
medical purposes in 1890,
and the first car tire in 1895,
and all of this was thanks
to Charles' invention.
- But despite almost single-handedly
transforming the rubber industry,
he never made much money.
I mean he spent thousands of dollars
defending his inventions
in patent disputes.
And when he passed away
in 1860 at the age of 59,
he was over $200,000 in debt.
That would be around 7.7 million today.
38 years later,
American entrepreneur,
Frank Seiberling, founded a tire company
and decided to name it in honor
of rubber's inventor, Charles Goodyear.
Today, the Goodyear company
makes $18.9 billion a year in revenue
and it's the third largest
tire manufacturer in the world.
For the past hundred years,
tires have consumed
the most natural rubber
out of any application.
But vulcanised rubber
alone isn't strong enough
and would wear down quickly,
lasting only around 8,000 kilometers.
So in the early 1900s,
car and tire companies started
experimenting with additives,
including something called carbon black.
- So with natural rubber, we got
carbon black.
- Reinforcement.
- Which is gonna add the cross-linking.
- This doesn't do the cross-linking.
- No, it doesn't?
- So this is the reinforcement in filler.
- Ah, okay.
- This makes it
durable and resilient.
- [Derek] Nowadays, passenger car tires
last about 100,000 kilometers.
Carbon black is what gives them
their color and durability.
- But carbon black has another benefit.
It conducts electricity.
- That's hugely important
because as you're driving down the road,
you are charging up the vehicle.
If you didn't dissipate
that static charge,
then you would get a shock
when you earth the car,
when you touch the car.
- But later, some companies wondered
if they could reduce rolling friction
by using a different additive.
So they tried silica instead,
making a whitish-looking tire.
But silica is a poor conductor
and rubber itself is an insulator.
So now, as the car moved, it
would slowly build up charge.
- As you go to refuel the car,
you have a highly charged,
static electricity-charged vehicle,
you put an earth conductor,
the fuel hose into the tank,
you create a spark in
the tank, car explodes.
There's a very vital
characteristic of tires
is that they should be conductive.
The other benefit is if
you're in a thunderstorm
and you are struck by lightning,
the lightning will hit the car.
It will act as a fire enclosure,
it'll completely protect you
and it'll dissipate down to the ground.
- [Derek] So people have
stuck to using carbon black
for most of the tire and only
a little silica in the treads.
- And since Goodyear's invention,
we've made over 70 billion tires.
If they were stacked on top of each other,
they could go to the
moon and back 21 times.
- [Derek] And almost all of these tires
needed natural rubber.
But fueling the rubber
boom came at a price,
especially early on.
In the late 19th century,
the Amazon region supplied
over 90% of the world's rubber
but wild rubber trees were often separated
by hundreds of meters.
So to keep up with growing demand,
rubber barons began to exploit natives
killing roughly 40,000 people
in the Putumayo region alone,
and likely over 100,000
across the wider Amazon region
between 1879 and 1911.
The humanitarian activist Roger Casement
said that, "It was first
called 'India Rubber,'
because it came from the Indies,
and the earliest European use
of it was to rub out or erase.
It is now called India
rubber because it rubs out
or erases the Indians."
- [Katrina] It is one of
the most appalling instances
of genocide and sickening
ill-treatment of native peoples.
- [Derek] But other countries like England
weren't happy with Brazil's monopoly.
So in 1876, the bio-pirate Henry Wickham
managed to smuggle 70,000
rubber seeds back to England.
The British Empire planted these seeds
all over Southeast Asia
which had a similar climate.
Only now, instead of having
just a few rubber trees
here and there, they made farms
of acres and acres of
nothing but rubber trees.
These plantations produced
far more than the Amazon.
Brazil's share of the rubber supply
dropped from over 80% in 1907
to 1.6% just over three decades later.
By the mid 1930s, over 90% of all rubber
came from the British
colonies in Southeast Asia.
And two-thirds of that rubber
went into making car tires.
One of the largest car
manufacturers at the time was Ford
which made an average of
1.5 million cars every year.
And Henry Ford wasn't comfortable
with England's monopoly.
So in 1928, he bought 10,000
square kilometers of land
from the Brazilian government
to build a utopian town.
He called it Fordlandia.
It had Cape Cod cottages,
a hospital, swimming pools,
a golf course and little
red fire hydrants.
It was an American city in
the middle of the Amazon.
It could house 10,000 people,
all working to plant
millions of rubber trees.
- [Newscaster] Ford Plantation
is a successful enterprise,
a tribute to skill and science.
- [Derek] But in the early 1930s,
things started to go wrong.
Every morning, the workers would wake up,
walk to the line of rubber trees
and they'd notice black spots.
Just a few at first,
little specks on the
undersides of the leaves,
like flakes of soot.
But by the afternoon,
they'd spread to cover
the leaves entirely.
And the next morning, the
leaves were falling off.
Shortly after that, the tree died.
Every day, another row of
trees was infected and dying.
- People who've seen it say
it looks like a fire front.
You have the infected trees
and it's green on one side
and black on the other.
And you see that black
line move day by day,
you could virtually watch it move
and leaving dead trees behind it.
- [Derek] The trees were infected
by the South American leaf blight,
a fungus native to South America.
This blight ruined the
3.6 million rubber trees
from Ford's plantations
by the early 1940s,
turning it into a disaster.
When planting his rubber trees,
instead of separating
them by hundreds of meters
like they were in the wild,
he planted them several meters apart.
200,000 of them.
- [Katrina] They're all touching,
their roots are touching,
their leaves are touching,
their branches are touching.
And so it's just like a plague,
one straight through the plantation.
- Ford tried relocating the project
to a town downstream, Belterra,
planting another 16,000
acres with rubber trees
but these too all died.
- [Derek] Ford's son eventually abandoned
the project in 1945.
The Fordlandia buildings still
stand in Brazil abandoned.
- And to this day, there is
no cure for the leaf blight.
The blight is so fatal to rubber trees,
they can't grow in plantations
in their native country.
That's why South America
makes up less than 2%
of the rubber supply.
Over 90% comes from Asia
which is why it is so essential
to prevent the spread of the
leaf blight to Southeast Asia.
- [Derek] Virtually,
all of the rubber trees
in Southeast Asia came from
those seeds Henry Wickham stole.
And newer trees are just
clones of the old ones.
so the farms are essentially
just one big monoculture.
- As a consequence of that,
we are particularly prone
to the potential outbreaks
of fungus and things like that.
If you get a fungal infection in Malaysia,
then you would end up
dramatically reducing
global production of rubber.
- So what's the outcome if
we were cut off from rubber?
- If SALB gets established
in Southeast Asia
and you lose natural rubber,
then you're talking about a complete
global societal meltdown.
You're left now with making
synthetic rubber tires at the most.
Worst case, they can't make them.
You can't make a truck tire,
you won't have any airplanes.
But the real potential is urban famine,
for over 50% of the world's
population is in cities.
How will you move food into
the cities to feed them?
- But something like this did wipe out
a large part of the rubber
supply just six years ago.
In 2019, two different diseases
jumped from palm trees to
rubber trees in Thailand.
- In six months,
these diseases had spread
across seven countries
and a million acres of trees.
And the next year saw a
10% drop in production.
- And the only reason it
didn't destroy more trees
was because of a different
outbreak that we all remember.
- COVID comes in early 2020.
It stopped the spread of these diseases
as a byproduct of trying to
stop the spread of COVID.
If COVID hadn't hit there,
how far would that have gone?
How many more millions of acres
would've, in effect, been
killed or seriously compromised
by these two leaf blights?
- Granted, it's hard to
predict what would happen
if we ran out of natural rubber.
Some say the impact could be catastrophic.
Grounded planes, failed
railways, even famine
and any disruption to the oil supply chain
would send shockwaves through
synthetic rubber products.
But oil is such a polarizing
and politically-charged topic,
deeply tied to global power struggles
and hidden incentives,
that it's hard to know
what's truly at stake.
That's why we specifically ask Ground News
to sponsor this video.
They gather news sources from
around the world in one spot.
So you can read about the same issue
from different perspectives,
put the context needed to
separate facts from politics.
For example, Iran controls a single strait
that handles roughly
20% of the world's oil.
What happens when they
threaten to close it
amid US strikes on their nuclear sites?
Well, on the topic, USA today
ran oil hits five-month high
after US strikes key
Iranian nuclear sites.
But the New York Post
led with US stocks surge
after restrained around attack on US base.
One headline warned to
a looming energy crisis,
the other stock market rally
and strategic restraint.
It's the same event but
completely different conclusions.
In times of uncertainty,
knowing who is telling
you the story and why
is just as important as
knowing what actually happened.
Ground News helps you do that
by showing you the split headlines
and surfacing stories hidden
from your usual news feeds
due to bias through their blind spot feed.
In fact, the Nobel Peace
Center called Ground News
"an excellent way to stay informed,
avoid echo chambers
and to expand your worldview."
And I agree.
If we want to properly
understand the crises
affecting us here at home
and around the world,
we need better tools.

and now, back to rubber.
- We take natural rubber for granted
in a huge number of different products.
So if you take a typical car,
there's something close to
250-300 rubber components
within the car.
You would have a nightmare
trying to re-engineer
all of those out of synthetic materials.
- If we were to lose natural rubber
and just rely on synthetic rubber,
would it still be possible
to do those applications?
- So this has happened in the past.
If you think about it,
all of these synthetic polymers
come from that initial thought process
that we can't get natural rubber,
we have to create other stuff.
It's a national security issue.
- That's wild.
- You're just like, oh, it's a tire.
But think about it, if
you don't have tires,
you can't move a military.
- Yeah, yeah.
The obvious question is, if
natural rubber is so great,
why can't we just replicate it in the lab?
And that's the exact
thing that the US tried
when during the Second World War,
Japan cut it off from roughly 97%
of the world's natural rubber supply.
- Modern war cannot be won without rubber.
- What then happened was an
enormous investment by the US,
equivalent to $11.1
billion in today's terms,
into synthetic rubber
and growing alternative
natural rubber crops.
- That's roughly a third
of the Manhattan project.
It was a complete gamble
but the four big US tire companies
were able to improve and manufacture
a synthetic rubber
called styrene-butadiene
in less than three years.
Unlike natural rubbers, styrene-butadiene
is made from two monomers.
Roughly 25% styrene and 75% butadiene,
both usually come from crude oil refining.
The monomers are dispersed in water
and combined into long chains
in a random arrangement.
Then, the rubber is vulcanised.
Now, compared to natural rubber,
it doesn't wear down as
quickly under friction
but it has a much lower tensile strength.
In 1942, the US used 99.6% natural rubber
and 0.4% synthetic.
But in 1945, it was practically reversed
at 14% natural and 86% synthetic.
Now, almost 70% of all
rubber consumed is synthetic
and the most common one is
still styrene-butadiene.
But there are some things
that natural rubber is just better at.
- If you think about airplane tires,
it's absolutely incredible
that they're up there
umpteen degrees below zero
before they start to come into land.
And then you've got this
huge weight of the airplane
on these dinky little tires
that increase in temperature enormously
over an incredibly small space of time
and only natural rubber can do it.
So airplane tires are
essentially 100% natural rubber
and you can't land if you've
got synthetic in the tire.
- So what can natural rubber do
that we just can't replicate?
- Okay, what I want you to think about.
- Yeah.
- Is you start to stretch it,
this first movement.
- Yeah.
- Hardly, it's very easy
to stretch that bit.
- Yeah.
- That first bit, I assume.
Now, think about how
much force you're using
to continue to stretch it.
- Yeah, it gets harder.
- Now,
it gets harder and harder
and harder and harder.
- It feels like,
yeah, it could snap.
- And then eventually,
you'll get to a break point.
- Yeah, yeah.
- But what's happening,
why it's getting harder
is that the rubber is getting
stronger as you stretch it.
- [Derek] As you stretch the polymers,
they start to align and stick together
through weak intermolecular forces
called Van der Waal's forces.
When they're packed tightly enough,
the polymers freeze together
in thin sheetlike crystals
aligned in the direction you stretch.
And as you keep pulling,
more and more polymers
join the crystal structure.
Each crystal acts as a new cross-link,
making the rubber harder and stronger.
- That ability to form
crystalite prevents tear.
So if you have crack propagation,
it hits a crystal and
can't go any further.
- [Derek] In a sample without a crack,
the stress is evenly distributed.
But if there is a crack, more
load flows right to the edge
so the rubber stretches more.
That area forms more crystals
so it becomes harder to break.
The crystals stop the crack growth
until a threshold is reached.
And then, it breaks.
This is what makes
natural rubber so durable.
It's self-reinforcing under stress,
stopping cracks in their tracks.
- Crystallization is what
makes natural rubber so good
for tough applications.
- The plane can weigh 5, 600 tons.
So if you think about that,
you've gotta, you know,
each tire is taking 20 tons.
And it's coming from a very
cold temperature up there, yeah?
It's -50, -60,
depending exactly how
high you've been flying.
And you go from zero rotational
speed quite fast, very fast
and you get generate a
lot of frictional heat
really quickly as well.
There's a reason why they
make tires for planes
out of natural rubber
and that's because it's
really demanding application.
And the crystallization
helps a huge amount
preserve those tires and help them last.
- [Derek] One study notes
that, "Experiment has shown
that no detectable
crack propagation occurs
in rubber undergoing crystallization
until the stress is so high
as to generate abrupt
catastrophic fracture."
- Oh, that was fast.
- That was fast.
- And then eventually,
you'll get to a break point.
And yet you finally overcame it.
- [Derek] When you pull
on a rubber sample,
you're applying a stress.
The polymers realign
and the wiggle unfolds.
So the piece deforms and gets longer.
The per unit change in
length is known as strain,
and we can plot this on
a stress-strain curve.
Lots of materials are
elastic around low stresses.
You stretch it a little
and the spacing between atoms changes.
But when you remove the force,
it goes back to its original shape.
But eventually, you hit a stress
where there is permanent deformation.
That's called the yield point.
The material can't go back
to the same shape after.
And if you keep going, it will fracture.
But the stress-strain curve
for rubber is a little weird.
It starts out stretching very
far with very little force.
That's the easy part.
But then as you keep pulling,
the stress shoots up really fast.
- So stretch it fast.
What do you notice?
- It's a little warm, maybe?
- It's hot, it's gone up in temperature
by 10 degrees.
- Yeah, yeah.
That section where it gets really hard
to pull it any further and it gets hotter,
that's right where rubber
starts to crystallize.
The rubber warms up because
as those new bonds form,
they release a bit of energy as heat.
Then if you keep stretching
it, you get to the point
where the crystal can no
longer hold it when it breaks.
But something strange happens
if you stop right before
that fracture point.
Then the rubber bounces
back but on a lower curve.
- Keep it stretched, keep it stretched
and wiggle it around.
Now, relax it.
Touch your lips, what do you got?
- Now it's a much cooler.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- So you went
for crystallization formula.
You stretched it, you crystallized it,
that's an exothermic reaction.
- Wow, okay.
- You then allowed it to
cool down to room temperature
and the stretch state
and you relaxed it
and you dissolved the crystals.
- That's weird.
- How'd you dissolve the crystals?
You've gotta take energy from somewhere
to dissolve crystals.
You cool the rubber band out.
- [Derek] The reason the
two curves are different
is because it takes more
energy to align the polymers
than it does for the
polymers to curl back up.
And this energy difference
is exactly the heat
that's released over a full cycle.
We've seen that natural rubber is built
using these building blocks
but the technical monomer
is actually isoprene
which looks like this.
It's the same atoms but with some groups
and bonds moved around.
So the technical term for
rubber is cis-1,4-polyisoprene.
- And we've actually been able to make
synthetic cis-1,4-polyisoprene.
You can take isoprene and polymerize it.
So it should behave exactly
like natural rubber, right?
- And that one is the closest
but it doesn't perform nearly as well
because it's not structurally as perfect
as natural rubber.
- [Derek] See, there are two ways
for the monomers to attach.
In natural rubber,
they attach on the same
side, the cis-attachment.
- The percentage of cis
in the molecular chain
that nature can provide
is really accurate.
It's 99.99%, something
of that sort of scale.
- [Derek] But with synthetic rubber,
it's easy for monomers
to attach on the opposite
side of the double bond.
That's the trans-attachment.
But now there's more room
for them to lay flat.
They don't have that extra wiggle
so they stretch less and
don't crystallize very well.
- And when you make the
synthetic equivalent,
it's pretty good but it's
98% cis polyisoprene.
There is, you know, 1% or 2%
it's gonna be trans-polyisoprene.
And therefore, isn't
susceptible for crystallization
and it's not as good
and hasn't not the same
strengths properties
that natural rubber would have.
- [Derek] In a tensile
test, a synthetic rubber
also stretched to around
600% before breaking.
But it only took around 9.1 megapascals
compared to over 14.1
megapascals for natural rubber.
But there are a few areas
where a synthetic rubber is
actually better than natural.
Under low stress, where
crystallization doesn't happen,
natural rubber loses the advantage.
So synthetic is preferred for the tread
of passenger car tires for
better abrasion resistance.
Nitrile rubber, a synthetic
rubber used for gloves,
also blocks harsher chemicals
from passing through.
- So in polyisoprene, we used to see,
let's say in chemotherapy agents,
maybe 80%-90% permeation.
In nitrile, we see maybe 10 - 20.
- Wow.
- So it's much better.
- That's huge.
- Mm, that's huge.
For a cancer center worker, that's huge.
- Nitrile gloves were
developed in the late 1980s
during the global AIDS pandemic
in response to the growing latex allergy.
Surprisingly, gloves weren't required
for every single procedure until
the CDC published a mandate
to prevent HIV transmission in 1987.
After the demand for gloves
went from 300 million
to over 36 billion by
the end of the 1980s.
Well, dozens of new latex glove factories
sprang up to meet the demands.
Typically, after a mold
is dipped in latex,
the glove is leached
and lots of proteins from the
tree are just washed away.
But then, they got rid of that step.
- This meant that all of
those soluble proteins
were left in the glove.
- So when nurses or doctors
were putting on or taking off
these unleached powdered gloves,
they would disperse all of
those proteins into the air.
- This nursing staff were
breathing those particles in,
breathing that dust in,
through their entire shifts
and into their lungs.
Now the patients, you've got these gloves
with loads of proteins,
washing that around in your innards.
- Thousands of people were exposed enough
to become allergic to latex.
- In the early 90s,
you said if you had four
surgical procedures,
you almost certainly have
Type I latex allergy.
If you've had 10, you do.
- So eventually, manufacturers
received enough complaints
that they started leaching again,
but by then it was too late.
Even if something's been properly leached,
if someone has that Type I latex allergy,
they're still gonna react to it.
Nitrile gloves helped combat that allergy.
But for long surgeries, some
doctors still prefer the softer
and more comfortable glove
that comes from natural latex.
So Dr. Cornish has been working
on alternative natural
rubber from the Guayule plant
which doesn't have the proteins
that people are allergic to.
This plant can grow in desert climates
and it makes a stronger, softer rubber
than even the Brazilian rubber tree.
- Not only does scaling up Guayule
help with the latex allergy,
it's also a safeguard in case
the blight ever makes its way
across to Southeast Asia.
Transportation, healthcare, construction,
there are so many industries
that are dependent on natural rubber.
- [Derek] There are regulations
around South American leaf blight control
and it's difficult to get a direct flight
from Brazil to Southeast Asia
but not impossible.
- It seems shortsighted to
leave the industry vulnerable
to like one bad flight.
For a material that only became
useful around 200 years ago,
it's now hard to imagine life without it.
When Henry Ford developed Fordlandia,
he didn't consult a
single rubber tree expert
who could have told him about the blight.
So let's not make that same mistake again.
