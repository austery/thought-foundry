I'm
 Steven
 Carroll
 and
 this
 is
 Here's


Why,
 where
 we
 take
 one
 news
 story
 and


explain
 it
 in
 just
 a
 few
 minutes
 with


our
 experts
 here
 at
 Bloomberg.


That
 fiscally
 fraught
 four
 I
 think
 are


very
 vulnerable
 to
 significant
 worse


selloffs.
 Luku
 warning
 that
 the
 deficit


could
 actually
 reach
 6%.


The
 largest
 sustained
 fiscal
 deficits


we'd
 seen
 in
 a
 really
 long
 time.
 Those


are
 pushing
 our
 star
 higher.


The
 US
 fiscal
 situation
 is
 that
 of
 of
 a


nation
 that's
 trying
 to
 work
 its
 way
 out


of
 a
 recession.


High
 level
 of
 deficit
 is
 potentially


inflationary.


There
 are
 still
 people
 who
 pedal
 the


idea
 that
 we
 could
 just
 abandon
 economic


responsibility,


cast
 off
 any
 constraints
 on
 spending.


They
 are
 wrong.
 France
 is
 breaking


records
 for
 short-lived
 governments.


Britain's
 Labor
 Party
 has
 seen
 its


popularity
 collapse
 within
 a
 year
 of
 its


landslide
 election
 win.
 And
 by
 contrast,


Italy's
 current
 government
 is
 one
 of
 the


most
 stable
 in
 recent
 history.


Governments
 across
 the
 developed
 world


are
 more
 indebted
 than
 ever,
 forcing


difficult
 choices
 from
 politicians
 who


see
 a
 greater
 proportion
 of
 their
 public


finances
 going
 to
 servicing
 their
 debts.


How
 they
 address
 this
 challenge
 is
 also


now
 even
 more
 closely
 tied
 to
 their


political
 fortunes.
 Here's
 why
 debt
 is


now
 a
 driving
 political
 force.


Our
 head
 of
 economics
 and
 government,


Stephanie
 Flanders,
 joins
 me
 now
 for


more.
 Stephanie,
 first
 of
 all,
 how
 big
 a


problem
 is
 debt
 in
 developed
 economies?


Well,
 I
 guess
 the
 quick
 thing
 to
 say
 is


it's
 a
 much
 bigger
 problem
 than
 it
 was


10
 or
 15
 years
 ago
 before
 the
 global


financial
 crisis,
 the
 early
 years
 of
 the


2000s.
 Um,
 we
 used
 to
 talk
 about
 debt
 in


advanced
 economies
 being
 in
 the
 range
 of


40
 to
 70%
 of
 GDP.
 There
 were
 exceptions


to
 that,
 but
 you
 remember
 even
 when


countries
 joining
 the
 Euro
 zone,
 they


were
 supposed
 to
 get
 to
 around
 60%
 of


their
 national
 income
 level
 of
 debt.
 And


that
 for
 most
 countries
 was
 not
 a
 big


heavy
 lift.
 But
 when
 we
 had
 the
 global


financial
 crisis,
 governments
 had
 to


bail
 all
 the
 banks
 out
 and
 support
 the


economy
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 We
 had
 debt


take
 a
 step
 change
 up
 and
 then
 another


step
 change
 came
 when
 we
 had
 COVID
 and


all
 the
 expenditure
 associated
 with


that.
 And
 you
 end
 up
 with
 a
 situation


where
 debt
 has
 more
 or
 less
 doubled
 in


many
 economies
 relative
 to
 the
 overall


size
 of
 the
 economy.
 What's
 funny
 is


that
 although
 the
 debt
 rose
 quite


significantly
 after
 the
 global
 financial


crisis,
 it's
 really
 only
 been
 a
 problem


recently
 because
 you
 had
 a
 combination


of
 high
 debt
 and
 interest
 rates
 going


up.
 You
 had
 an
 amazing
 situation
 before


that
 where
 although
 debt
 has
 gone
 up
 a


lot,
 the
 cost
 of
 servicing
 that
 debt
 had


been
 going
 down
 and
 down
 and
 down.
 You


know,
 we
 went
 into
 this
 era
 of
 sometimes


having
 zero
 negative
 interest
 rates
 and


that
 was
 making
 it
 very
 easy
 for


governments
 to
 ignore
 the
 problem
 of


debt,
 the
 big
 stock
 of
 debt
 sitting


there.
 but
 no
 longer.


But
 when
 we
 think
 about
 the
 world's


developed
 economies,
 are
 they
 all
 in
 a


similar
 boat?
 How
 similar,
 say,
 is
 the


situation
 in
 France
 or
 in
 the
 UK,
 both


of
 which
 are
 seeing
 impacts
 on
 the


political
 scene?
 There's
 some
 structural


forces
 that
 are
 common
 to
 all
 countries


and
 then
 there's
 specific
 things
 that


are
 causing
 markets
 to
 focus
 on
 one


aspect
 more
 than
 another
 and
 making


things
 particularly
 difficult
 for


government.
 So
 you
 know
 the
 structural


things
 are
 you
 know
 I've
 already


mentioned
 it
 it's
 interest
 rates
 have


taken
 this
 kind
 of
 step
 change
 up
 in


response
 to
 the
 inflation
 we
 had
 after


co
 that's
 made
 it
 more
 expensive
 to


finance
 the
 debt
 everywhere
 and
 suddenly


finance
 ministers
 are
 noticing
 that
 a


much
 larger
 share
 of
 the
 money
 coming
 in


in
 tax
 revenues
 is
 going
 out
 in
 the
 form


of
 just
 servicing
 debt
 which
 no
 no


finance
 minister
 really
 likes
 to
 do.


They
 want
 to
 spend
 on
 hospitals
 and


schools
 and
 and
 so
 the
 voters
 want
 them


to
 do
 that.
 So
 there's
 there's
 that


structural
 problem.
 There's
 also
 the


problems
 we
 often
 talk
 about
 aging


populations,
 the
 pressure
 of
 health


spending.
 All
 of
 those
 things
 are
 not


going
 away.
 I
 think
 what
 is
 distinctive


in
 different
 countries
 is
 how
 much
 those


problems
 are
 really
 sort
 of
 biting
 and


interreacting
 with
 the
 politics
 of
 the


country.
 So
 in
 the
 UK,
 the
 stock
 of
 debt


is
 actually
 not
 as
 high
 as
 it
 is
 in


France.
 It's
 around
 100%
 of
 GDP.
 And
 uh


we
 have
 a
 pretty
 sort
 of
 reasonable


approach
 to
 stabilizing
 that
 debt.
 But


unfortunately
 we
 have
 very
 low
 maturity


debt.
 So
 our
 debt
 sort
 of
 rolls
 over


very
 quickly.
 You
 quite
 often
 have
 to
 go


back
 into
 the
 market
 to
 refinance
 your


debt.
 And
 that
 means
 that
 it's
 been
 much


more
 susceptible
 to
 that
 rise
 in


interest
 rates
 than
 say
 France
 which


actually
 had
 slightly
 older
 debt.
 It
 had


a
 higher
 maturity
 debt.
 the
 average
 bit


of
 debt
 owed
 to
 the
 French
 government


was
 kind
 of
 seven
 or
 eight
 years
 and


it's
 quite
 a
 lot
 shorter
 than
 that
 in


the
 case
 of
 the
 UK.
 So
 there
 were


specific
 things
 that
 caused
 the
 problem


to
 be
 different
 in
 different
 countries.


In
 the
 UK
 it's
 a
 sort
 of
 liquidity


problem,
 not
 so
 much
 a
 stock
 problem.


People
 in
 the
 financial
 markets
 just


worry
 a
 bit
 year
 to
 year
 about
 how
 that


money
 is
 going
 to
 be
 raised
 to
 finance


the
 debt.
 In
 France
 it's
 more
 people


look
 at
 it
 and
 say
 well
 they
 can
 they


can
 finance
 it
 this
 year
 and
 next
 year


but
 you
 know
 when
 are
 they
 actually


going
 to
 bring
 it
 down?
 when
 is
 the


political
 system
 going
 to
 coalesce


enough
 to
 actually
 take
 action
 on
 this?


Is
 the
 United
 States
 in
 the
 same


situation
 or
 is
 it
 exceptional
 in
 this


regard?


So,
 if
 you
 didn't
 know
 that
 you
 were


talking
 about
 the
 US
 and
 you
 just
 looked


at
 their
 numbers,
 you'd
 think
 it
 was


sort
 of
 a
 worse
 case
 than
 Italy.
 It's


got
 higher
 debt,
 120%
 of
 of
 GDP.
 It
 has


a
 higher
 fiscal
 deficit.
 It's
 borrowing


a
 lot
 even
 though
 the
 economy
 has
 been


very
 strong.
 It's
 actually,
 you
 know,


not
 in
 a
 recession,
 which
 is
 pretty


unusual.
 and
 it
 has
 a
 Congress
 and
 a


president
 that
 have
 are
 now
 adding
 to


debt,
 passing
 tax
 cuts
 and
 other
 things


that
 are
 costing
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 If
 you


didn't
 know
 it
 was
 the
 US,
 you'd
 say
 all


of
 those
 things,
 it's
 heading
 for
 a


disaster.
 What
 the
 US,
 of
 course,
 is
 is


exceptional.
 And
 the
 one
 of
 the
 big


things
 it
 has
 in
 its
 favor
 is
 the
 dollar


as
 the
 reserve
 currency
 for
 the
 whole


world.
 It
 is
 also
 often
 a
 safe
 haven
 for


financial
 markets.
 And
 probably
 most


important
 of
 all,
 it's
 been
 growing
 a


lot
 faster
 than
 the
 European
 countries


I've
 been
 talking
 about.
 So
 it
 doesn't


have
 to
 work
 so
 hard
 to
 finance
 that


debt
 yeartoear
 even
 though
 it
 is
 growing


and
 growing
 and
 people
 do
 wonder
 whether


the
 situation
 is
 going
 to
 shift
 in
 the


next
 few
 years
 in
 terms
 of
 people


worrying
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 the
 US
 but
 at


the
 moment
 if
 surprisingly
 little


how
 are
 political
 leaders
 dealing
 with


the
 challenges
 then
 of
 of
 higher
 debt


and
 debt
 repayments
 are
 there
 good
 or


bad
 examples
 that
 we
 can
 look
 to


I
 was
 thinking
 about
 this
 and
 I
 was
 all


the
 good
 examples
 I
 could
 think
 of
 they


all
 seem
 to
 be
 a
 long
 time
 ago
 and


there's
 very
 few
 good
 examples
 today.
 So


if
 you
 look
 back
 in
 the
 early
 '9s,


Sweden
 had
 very
 high
 levels
 of
 debt
 and


actually
 had
 an
 interesting
 time
 where


the
 Social
 Democrats,
 the
 left-wing


party
 said,
 "Look,
 as
 long
 as
 we
 haven't


got
 on
 top
 of
 this
 debt
 and
 spending,


we're
 going
 to
 be
 beholden
 to
 the


financial
 markets,
 we
 won't
 have
 our
 own


freedom
 of
 maneuver
 as
 a
 country
 and
 we


won't
 be able
 to
 do
 the
 things
 we
 want


to
 do."
 And
 they
 took
 some
 really


difficult
 decisions
 various
 times.
 Other


countries
 do
 that.
 We
 even
 saw
 it
 in
 the


US
 in
 the
 80s.
 Long-term
 problems
 they


were
 facing
 with
 social
 security
 got


fixed
 well
 ahead
 of
 time
 in
 the
 UK
 as


well.
 We
 had
 changes
 to
 to
 pension
 rules


that
 actually
 longterm
 reduce
 the
 cost


of
 spending.
 There
 hasn't
 been
 a
 lot
 of


that
 in
 the
 last
 few
 years,
 I
 have
 to


say.
 And
 when
 you
 talk
 about
 how
 well


politicians
 are
 dealing
 with
 it,
 there


aren't
 many
 that
 are
 really
 dealing
 with


it
 at
 all.


Can
 debt
 via
 the
 bond
 markets
 actually


help
 to
 rein
 in
 politicians
 who
 might


have
 more
 unconventional
 fiscal
 plans
 or


who
 are
 ignoring
 some
 of
 their
 debt


problems?


I
 mean,
 that's
 what
 we've
 traditionally


seen.
 And
 you
 know,
 you
 you
 remember


there
 was
 that
 famous,
 you
 know,
 the


adviser
 James
 Carville
 to
 to
 Bill


Clinton
 said,
 "Oh,
 when
 I
 when
 I
 die,
 I


want
 to
 come
 back
 as
 a
 bond
 trader


because
 they
 get
 to
 call
 the
 shots."
 And


it
 used
 to
 be
 that
 that
 kind
 of
 pressure


did
 make
 a
 difference
 to
 government's


changing
 policy.
 And
 of
 course,
 we've


seen
 that
 in
 extreme
 cases
 in
 the
 last


few
 years.
 Liz
 Trust
 government
 was


famously
 brought
 down
 by
 the
 bond


market's
 reaction,
 among
 other
 things,


the
 bond
 market's
 reaction
 to
 her


budget,
 her
 emergency
 budget.
 But
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 US,
 as
 I
 said
 before,
 it


just
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 be
 operating
 in
 a


way
 it
 might
 have
 done
 in
 the
 past.
 I


mean,
 the
 US
 is
 the
 only
 developed


economy
 to
 have
 seen
 its
 10-year
 cost
 of


borrowing
 actually
 go
 down
 slightly


since
 the
 start
 of
 this
 year.
 I
 mean,
 it


had
 gone
 up
 a
 bit
 since
 before
 that,
 but


when
 you
 think
 about
 how
 much
 debt
 has


now
 in
 the
 future
 is
 going
 to
 go
 up
 as
 a


result
 of
 Donald
 Trump's
 uh
 big


beautiful
 bill
 and
 the
 sort
 of
 lack
 of


responsible
 policym
 in
 in
 Washington,


it's
 in
 a
 way
 the
 bond
 market's
 kind
 of


letting
 the
 US
 off
 the
 hook.
 Do
 we
 have


any
 conception
 that
 voters
 are
 making


political
 choices
 because
 of
 the
 debt


problem
 or
 paying
 attention
 to
 it
 in
 a


close
 way?
 I
 mean,
 the
 curious
 thing


about
 this
 is
 if
 you
 look
 at
 opinion


polls,
 the
 majority
 of
 voters
 and


probably
 more
 than
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 are


worried
 about
 debt
 say
 it's
 a
 big


problem
 that
 the
 government
 needs
 to


fix.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 the
 UK,
 people
 more


generally
 are
 sort
 of
 worried
 that
 the


government
 has
 kind
 of
 lost
 control
 of


the
 economy
 or
 at least
 has
 has
 lost
 the


ability
 to
 do
 the
 things
 that
 it
 wants


to
 do
 because
 of
 this
 bind
 they're
 in


over
 debt
 and
 the
 low
 level
 of
 growth.


But
 then
 you
 look
 at
 what
 voters


actually
 vote
 for
 and
 by
 and
 large
 they


haven't
 shown
 a
 great
 desire
 to
 vote
 for


parties
 that
 are
 promising
 tough


decisions.
 You
 know,
 in
 the
 UK,
 one
 of


the
 things
 long-term
 that's
 really


affecting
 the
 structural
 increase
 in


spending
 is
 the
 pensions
 triple
 lock.


This
 commitment
 to
 always
 increasing
 the


state
 pension
 by
 either
 2.5%
 or
 the


right
 of
 average
 earnings
 um
 or
 the
 rate


of
 inflation,
 whichever
 of
 them
 is


higher.
 It's
 been
 consistently


rising
 the
 pension
 spending
 as
 a
 share


of
 pretty
 much
 everything.
 But
 no
 party,


even
 when
 they
 pay
 lip
 service
 to


wanting
 to
 control
 the
 debt,
 is
 willing


to
 say
 to
 voters,
 you
 know what,
 that's


got
 to
 change.
