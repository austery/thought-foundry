Hi
 everyone,
 I'm
 Nikolai
 Tangan
 and


today
 we
 are
 joined
 by
 one
 of
 the
 best


investors
 of
 all
 time
 actually.
 So
 Chris


Horn,
 not
 only
 is
 this
 fund
 TCI
 one
 of


the
 best
 and
 most
 successful
 funds
 that


Europe
 has
 ever
 seen,
 but
 also
 the


charity
 is
 one
 now
 one
 of
 the
 largest
 in


the
 world.
 So
 uh
 Chris,
 you
 continue
 to


have
 a
 immense
 positive
 impact
 on
 the


world.
 Thanks
 for
 coming.
 Good
 luck.


Let's
 start
 with
 um
 the
 investment


world.
 What
 makes
 a
 good
 investment?
 I


think
 this
 is
 uh
 something
 a
 lot
 of


people
 uh
 get
 wrong.
 They
 that's
 they


think
 it's


about
 growth
 often.
 Okay.
 Or
 something


new.
 Neither
 of
 them
 those
 things
 in


themselves
 are
 to
 us


um
 uh
 matter
 by
 themselves.
 The
 most


important


thing
 and
 without
 which
 it's


um
 in
 in
 um
 for
 the
 let's
 say
 the
 types


of
 investing
 that
 we
 do


is
 high
 barriers
 to
 entry
 the
 moes
 that


Warren
 Buffett
 has
 talked
 about.
 Now
 can


before
 we
 dig
 into
 that
 the
 can
 a


distressed
 asset
 of


a
 you
 know
 a
 piece
 of
 real
 estate
 that


selling
 at
 half
 price
 because
 of
 a


liquidation
 also
 be
 a
 good
 investment?


Yes.


So,
 can
 there
 be
 a
 role
 for
 cheap


average
 assets?
 Yeah,
 let's
 call
 them


lowquality
 assets
 which
 are
 trading
 at


big
 discounts
 to
 replacement
 cost.
 Yes,


that
 that's
 the
 that's
 the
 type
 of


investing
 that
 can
 work.
 Yeah.
 That
 I've


I've
 done
 in
 my
 time.
 Yeah.
 Cheap


average
 businesses
 or
 cheap
 bad


businesses.
 But
 I'm
 I
 don't
 feel
 that
 I


can
 have
 any
 confidence
 in
 that
 type
 of


investing.


um


because
 the
 um
 the
 earnings
 power
 of


those
 averages


businesses
 is
 unpredictable.
 Well,
 so


what
 are
 good
 modes?
 The
 most
 important


answer
 is
 ones
 that
 are
 sustainable.


Okay,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 uh
 and
 ideally
 you


would
 have
 multiple
 moes,
 multiple
 ar


pieces
 of
 defense
 and
 there
 are
 many


ways
 is
 is
 basically
 something
 that


means
 that
 the
 business
 is
 difficult
 to


replace.
 Yeah.
 uh
 difficult
 to
 compete


with.
 Yes.
 And
 replace
 two
 two


substitution
 risk
 and
 competition
 risk.


Y
 those
 long-term
 become
 different
 very


difficult
 because
 why
 is
 it
 so


important?
 Competition
 kills
 profits.


Yep.
 That's
 as
 simple
 as
 that.


Substitution
 eliminates
 your
 business.


So
 we
 look
 at
 um
 um
 there there
 are
 many


many
 modes.


one
 which
 most
 people
 don't
 look
 at
 uh


most
 investors
 don't
 really
 look
 at


actually
 interestingly
 is
 irreplaceable


physical
 assets.
 Okay,
 we're
 in
 a
 world


where
 people
 uh
 just
 look
 at
 earnings.


They
 don't
 look
 at


uh
 asset
 value
 or
 physical
 assets
 and


and
 and
 uh


um
 and
 so
 we
 like
 quite
 a
 bit
 of


infrastructure.
 Um
 airports
 for
 example


um
 one
 of
 our
 investments
 which
 uh
 has


been
 um
 the
 airport
 group
 in
 Spain
 where


the
 government
 privatized.
 Yes.
 Ayena


and
 um
 you
 just
 can
 never
 they'll
 never


build
 a
 second
 airport
 at
 Madrid
 or
 any


other
 places.
 These
 are,
 you
 know,


natural
 monopolies
 and
 um
 so
 but
 that


also
 applies
 to
 toll
 roads
 and
 railroads


and
 um
 telecom
 towers.
 Um
 so
 uh
 there


are
 many
 forms
 of
 infrastructure


transmission
 towers
 that
 um
 um
 are
 hard


to
 compete
 with
 because
 they're
 natural


monopolies
 where


um
 where
 um
 of
 course
 some
 of
 these


things
 can
 be
 overbuilt
 like
 cable.
 So


there's
 a
 form
 of
 infrastructure
 but
 it


it's
 it's
 it's


it's
 usually
 you
 have
 to
 look
 at
 the


details
 of
 case
 by
 case
 very
 unusual
 to


try


to
 and
 usually
 go
 and
 get
 the
 planning


uh
 to
 build
 a
 second
 airport.
 No


economic
 case
 to
 it.
 I
 mean
 I
 can't


remember
 how
 long
 they
 struggled
 to
 get


a
 an
 extra
 runway
 at
 Heathro.
 Right.
 So


planning
 exactly
 planning
 and
 then
 uh


roads
 there's
 no
 economic
 case
 to
 build


a
 second
 road
 or
 you
 don't
 have
 the


land.
 for
 different


uh
 literally
 no
 so
 so
 infrastructure
 is


physical
 assets
 is
 one
 a
 second
 is
 IP


intellectual
 property
 that's
 right
 and


uh
 which
 is
 so


advanced
 okay
 that
 it's
 very
 difficult


to
 replicate
 well
 so
 what
 kind
 of


intellectual
 property
 are
 you
 thinking


um
 one
 space
 we
 like
 is
 aircraft
 engines


Um
 and
 uh
 there
 it
 is
 a
 very
 complicated


product


because
 the


um
 materials
 complexity
 the
 the the
 the


engines
 run
 at
 such
 high
 temperatures


that
 metals
 melt
 and
 so
 many
 different


things
 have
 to
 come
 together.
 Yeah.


Thousands
 and
 thousands
 of
 complex


parts.
 So
 that's
 one
 where
 that's
 a


business
 where
 there
 are
 only
 two


players
 in
 narrow
 body
 engines
 and
 two


in


widebody
 and
 there
 have
 been
 no
 new


entrance
 for
 more
 than
 50
 years.
 The


last
 new
 entrance
 was
 DE
 and
 so
 that


tells
 you
 something.
 Yeah,
 it's
 a
 big


industry
 but
 it's
 so
 complex
 very
 hard


to
 enter.
 Another
 uh
 barrier
 to
 entry
 is


um
 uh
 installed
 base.
 Okay,
 which


applies
 to
 the
 aircraft
 engine
 business.


Once
 those
 engines
 are


there,
 they
 um
 for
 various
 reasons,
 you


get
 the
 spare
 parts
 business
 on
 it.
 And


um
 uh
 another
 um
 of
 uh
 barriers
 to
 entry


is
 scale,
 although
 that's
 that's
 not
 a


uh
 a
 guarantee
 of
 of
 uh


um
 of
 uh
 competitive
 uh
 moat.
 Um
 network


effects
 is
 another
 important
 barrier
 to


entry.
 You
 can
 see
 this
 in
 assets
 like


Visa,
 Meta.
 Yeah,
 two
 examples
 of
 um


network
 effects
 and
 brands
 are
 another


barrier
 to
 entry.
 But
 I'm
 not
 saying


every
 brand
 is
 is
 powerful.
 But
 you


know,
 you
 think
 about
 a
 McDonald's,
 it's


a
 it
 has
 a
 value.
 There
 are
 some
 brands


which
 are
 powerful
 and
 sustainable,
 but


not
 all.
 And
 I'll
 mention
 one
 more
 uh


moat
 which
 is
 customer
 switching
 costs.


Take
 missionritical
 software
 once
 it's


installed.
 Uh
 companies
 are
 very


reluctant
 to
 to
 mess
 with
 it
 and
 and
 and


switch
 because
 of
 the
 complexity.
 How


important
 are
 recurring
 revenue
 streams


for
 you
 when
 you
 look
 at
 businesses?


It's
 it
 is
 important.


Um
 but
 the
 predictability
 of
 when
 they


recur
 is
 not
 okay.
 Let
 me
 give
 you
 an


example.
 So
 what's
 most
 important
 for
 us


is
 something
 slightly
 different
 which
 is


essential
 product
 or
 service.
 We
 don't


like
 things
 which
 are


discretionary.
 Okay.
 So
 one
 space
 we've


invested
 in
 for
 a
 long
 time
 is
 rating


agencies
 and
 here
 these
 are
 the
 these


are
 the
 people
 who
 basically
 give
 kind


of
 character
 to
 different
 type
 of
 yeah


they
 say
 is
 it
 good
 or
 bad?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


To
 people
 who
 invest
 in
 bonds,
 uh
 they


say
 is
 it
 investment
 grade,


non-investment
 grade,
 give
 for
 research


and
 uh
 if
 you
 like,
 bless
 it.
 And
 uh


there
 you
 can
 actually
 defer
 an
 issuer


pays
 for
 the
 rating,
 but
 they
 don't
 have


to


um
 refinance
 their
 bonds,
 which
 is
 a
 big


part
 of
 it
 in
 any
 given
 year.
 M
 they
 can


delay
 and
 defer
 but
 eventually
 the
 debt


has
 to
 be
 refinanced
 and
 and and
 and


rated
 and
 so
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 and
 so


I
 think
 essential


need
 is
 is is
 is
 uh
 the
 the


the
 bigger
 point
 but
 uh
 usually
 our


companies
 have
 uh
 yeah
 recurring
 and


predictable
 revenue
 streams
 of
 essential


products
 I
 yeah
 and
 so
 do
 they
 have
 to


grow
 depending
 on
 valuation
 not


necessarily


um
 and
 uh
 or
 not
 not
 necessarily
 at
 a


fast
 rate.
 Okay?
 And
 you
 and
 growth
 can


come
 from
 two
 forms,
 volume
 and
 price.


So
 you
 have
 to
 break
 it
 down.
 Now
 why


isn't
 growth
 as
 important
 as
 people


investors
 usually
 assume
 it
 to
 be
 um


because
 you
 can
 have
 profitless


growth.
 The
 airline
 industry
 over
 a


hundred
 years
 has
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 growth.


Airline
 travel
 has
 grown
 at
 5%
 a
 year.


Yep.
 Continues
 to
 grow
 uh
 consistently.


But
 airlines
 as
 a
 business
 cumulatively


and
 collectively
 have
 made
 almost
 you


know
 minimal
 profits.


Yeah.
 Despite
 growth
 because
 the
 very


low
 barriers
 to
 entry
 and
 so
 um
 so
 I
 I
 I


would
 say
 growth
 without
 barriers
 to


entry


is
 is
 not
 a
 combination
 that
 you
 you


want.
 Some
 of
 these
 businesses
 are
 quite


uh
 capital
 intensive
 like
 it's
 not
 cheap


to
 build
 an
 airport.
 Yeah.
 Does
 that


matter
 for
 you?


Well,
 you
 have
 to
 look
 at
 like


everything
 into
 the
 detail
 and
 some


airports


uh
 are
 um
 well
 all
 airports
 have


regulation
 on
 landing
 charges
 but


some
 the
 non-landing
 charges
 are


unregulated.
 the
 shops,
 the
 advertising,


the
 the
 VIP
 lounges,
 the
 parking.
 Yep.


And
 um
 the
 so-called
 dual
 till


regulation.
 One
 till
 is
 regulated,
 one


till
 is


unregulated.
 And
 those
 are
 very
 low


capital
 in
 in
 in
 intensity.
 Yep.
 It's


it's
 it's
 uh
 in
 effect.
 Yep.
 And
 uh
 and


high
 returns
 on
 capital.
 They
 grow


um
 because
 there's
 more
 and
 more
 demand


for
 travel.
 And
 uh
 so
 um


so
 and
 again
 capital
 intensity
 by
 itself


it's
 part
 of
 the


equation.
 Okay.
 But
 it's
 still


um
 um


um
 and
 it


it
 it
 tells
 you
 how
 valuable
 growth
 is.


Okay.
 But
 what


trumps,
 if
 you
 don't
 mind
 that


expression,
 what
 trumps
 the
 uh
 the
 all


of
 this?
 Still,
 it's
 still
 a
 valid


expression,
 don't
 Yes.
 What
 trumps
 all


of
 this
 is
 the
 the the
 the
 the
 Barry


century.
 Okay.
 What
 about
 regulation?


You've
 been
 you've
 been
 big
 in
 things


electric.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I'll
 go
 into
 that,


but
 I
 I
 I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 the
 the


point
 about
 growth
 can
 come
 from
 two


forms,
 price
 and
 volume.
 Okay.
 And
 most


companies
 don't
 have
 pricing
 power.
 They


can
 only
 price
 if
 they're
 lucky
 at


inflation.
 And
 that's
 why
 people
 don't


focus
 on
 it.
 They
 don't
 even
 look
 at


where
 growth
 comes
 from.
 They
 just


assume
 it's
 volume
 plus
 inflation.
 But


there
 is
 a
 special
 group
 of
 super


companies
 that
 can
 price
 above


inflation.
 And


that's
 as
 Buffett
 taught
 the
 test
 of


whether
 you
 have
 the
 moat.
 Okay.


And
 this
 real
 pricing
 power
 above


inflation
 can
 be
 very
 valuable
 because


if
 you
 can
 price
 1%
 above
 inflation
 and


and
 you
 have
 a
 20%
 profit
 margin,
 your


profits
 will
 grow
 5%
 faster
 than


revenue.
 And
 um
 people
 don't
 go
 into
 it


or
 analyze
 it
 because
 there's
 so
 few


companies
 that
 that
 have
 it.
 But
 but


um
 this
 is
 something
 we
 have
 a
 you
 know


a
 lot
 of
 our
 investments
 have
 this


because
 incremental
 pricing
 is
 pretty


much
 all
 profits.
 That's
 right.
 And
 it's


very
 potent
 if
 you
 have
 the
 lower
 your


margin
 is.
 So
 this
 is
 why
 you
 asked


about
 growth
 and
 is
 it
 how
 important
 if


it's
 if
 you're
 asking
 about
 volume


growth
 but
 I
 and
 I
 have
 low
 volume


growth
 but
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 pricing


growth
 that's
 actually
 more
 important


because
 of
 the
 leveraged
 effect
 of


there's
 no
 cost
 associated
 with
 it.
 M


regulation.
 Yes.
 Um
 you
 have
 been
 in
 a


lot
 of
 regulated
 businesses.
 So
 you


mentioned
 airports,
 but
 you've
 been
 in


Red
 Electric,
 which
 is
 like
 electricity


transmission
 company.
 You
 have
 done


quite
 a
 few
 of
 these
 things.
 Yes,
 I


have.
 And
 actually,
 it's
 a
 general
 risk.


Um
 because
 if
 you
 have
 barriers
 too
 low,


competition
 or
 substitution
 eliminates


your
 business
 and
 your
 investment.


Barriers
 too
 high,
 regulators
 may
 come


knocking
 on
 your
 door.
 Yep.
 M
 every
 case


is
 different.
 Yeah.
 And


um
 the
 ideal
 case
 is
 you
 that
 there
 is


competition
 but
 weak
 competition.


And
 apparent


competition.
 Okay.
 So
 tell
 me
 what
 is


apparent
 competition?
 Yeah.
 Well
 it
 it's


really
 weak
 competition
 and
 rational


competition.
 Okay.


So
 the
 um
 take
 some
 water
 examples


um
 um
 uh
 Pratt
 and
 Whitney
 competes
 with


GE
 and
 Saffron.
 It
 has
 a
 25%
 share
 of


new
 orders.
 It's
 it
 can
 as
 a


product,
 but
 it's
 not
 nearly
 as
 as
 good.


Yeah.
 It's
 it's
 got
 35%
 of
 its
 engines


grounded,
 multiple
 technical
 problems.


just
 has
 lost
 a
 lot
 of
 trust,
 but
 it's


it's
 there
 competing
 um
 and
 uh


um
 a
 and
 uh
 for
 new
 engines.
 Yeah.
 But


price
 isn't
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 in


this
 industry.
 Reliability
 is.
 Yeah.
 And


so
 you


um
 and


so
 and
 as
 it
 struggles
 it
 has
 to
 raise


prices
 because
 it's
 got
 to
 you
 know
 lots


of
 difficulties
 and
 sometimes
 where


there
 is
 competition
 that
 competition


chooses
 uh
 not
 to
 compete
 you
 know


generally
 speaking
 not
 a
 specific


industry


um
 decides
 to
 be
 rational
 yeah
 and
 and


and
 and
 compete
 on
 you
 know


non-pricbased


uh
 uh
 approach.
 Okay.
 And
 then
 the


detail
 matters.
 So
 you
 might
 have
 looked


at
 Heathrow
 airport
 and
 see
 oh
 that


airport
 is
 fully
 regulated.
 Airports


can't
 be
 good.
 But
 if
 you
 look
 into
 the


detail
 of
 Aena
 it's
 a
 different
 animal.


It
 has
 a
 piece
 that's
 regulated
 and
 and


and
 a
 much
 bigger
 piece
 70%
 of
 the
 value


maybe
 more
 which
 is
 unregulated.
 Yeah.


And
 so
 uh
 maybe
 the
 unregulated
 business


the
 regulated
 business
 will
 give
 you
 a


bond-like
 return
 7%
 but
 the
 unregulated


give
 you
 a
 much
 higher
 return.
 Do
 do
 you


see
 now
 the
 other
 group
 of
 businesses


you've
 been
 uh
 very
 big
 in
 has
 been
 the


stock
 exchanges
 you
 know
 you
 both
 do


stock
 exchange
 and
 so
 on
 in
 the
 past.


Yes.
 Yes.
 Why
 are
 they
 why
 were
 they
 so


good?
 In
 the
 case
 of
 uh
 Deutsche
 Borsa


starting
 with
 that
 they
 had
 a
 derivative


business
 called
 Eur
 which
 was
 a
 natural


monopoly.
 It
 was
 a
 network
 effect.
 This


was
 the
 barrier
 to
 entry
 that
 liquidity


uh
 of
 a
 marketplace
 um
 for
 uh
 trading


bond
 futures
 European
 bond


futures.


it
 the
 the
 network
 effect
 of
 getting


best
 prices
 in
 in in
 the
 most
 uh
 liquid


market
 meant
 it
 became
 what
 it's
 termed


a
 winner
 takes
 all
 or
 natural
 monopoly


and
 once
 you
 have
 that
 liquidity
 very


hard
 to
 move
 people
 away
 price
 you
 can


never
 compete
 on
 best
 price
 and
 London


stock
 exchange
 has
 that
 for
 LCH
 clearet


business
 a
 clearing
 business
 and


So
 where
 an


exchange
 can
 CME
 has
 it
 on
 US
 uh
 futures


establish
 this
 natural
 monopoly
 by
 being


the
 first
 mover.
 Okay,
 the
 winner
 takes


all.


Then
 the
 these
 exchanges
 can
 be
 be
 very


good.
 But
 of
 course
 they've
 changed
 now.


London
 stock
 exchanges
 in
 many
 different


businesses
 sells
 data
 and
 half
 their


earnings
 are
 from
 data
 and
 that's


non-proprietary
 data
 reselling


non-proprietary
 data.
 So
 it
 has
 a


vulnerability
 on
 that
 piece.
 They're
 no


longer


just
 what
 they
 used
 to
 be.
 Um
 and
 then


there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 growth
 without


capital.
 Yeah.
 as
 people
 came
 and
 traded


more,
 as
 capital
 markets
 grew,
 you
 grew


without
 capital,
 which
 was
 uh
 was
 was


very
 valuable.
 What
 are
 the
 type
 of


companies
 you
 would
 never
 invest
 in?


Type
 of
 industries.
 Yeah,
 that's
 a
 good


question.
 We
 have
 a
 long
 list
 of


companies
 we
 don't
 invest
 in.
 We're
 very


focused
 and
 we
 call
 them
 the
 risky
 and


bad
 industries.
 Uh
 and
 that's
 and
 I
 have


invested
 in
 some
 of
 these
 in
 the
 past,


but
 I've
 learned


banks.
 Sorry
 for
 that.
 There's
 a
 bank.


We
 are
 not
 the
 banks.
 We
 hate
 the


central
 bank.
 Central
 bank.
 Central
 bank


is
 good.
 Yes,
 central
 banking
 can
 be


good.
 But
 uh
 we
 don't
 like
 banks.
 We


don't
 like
 banks.
 And
 why
 not?
 Why
 not?


Why
 not
 the
 low
 quality
 of
 earnings?


Because
 they're
 very
 leveraged.


Um
 and
 um
 uh
 uh
 much
 more
 than
 people


think,
 you
 know,
 because
 people
 look
 at


oh
 equity
 to
 risk
 weighted
 assets,
 but


equity
 to
 total
 assets.
 Many
 banks
 have


been
 have
 run
 it
 a
 hundred
 times
 and
 and


so
 two
 they're
 opaque
 ah
 you
 can't
 look


into
 them
 you
 can't
 yeah
 you
 can't
 uh
 I


remember


um
 prefinancial
 crisis
 I
 had
 a
 look
 at


credit
 Swiss
 and
 I
 sat
 down
 with
 the
 the


then
 CEO
 Brady
 Dugan
 and
 and
 said
 put


his
 balance
 sheet
 in
 front
 of
 him
 from


the
 the
 the
 annual
 accounts
 and
 said
 you


have
 uh
 multi-
 trillion
 uh
 dollar


balance
 sheet.
 Can
 we
 walk
 through
 the


line
 items
 cuz
 I
 don't
 understand
 it.
 He


said
 I
 don't


either.
 He
 was
 a
 very
 honest
 guy.
 I


really
 like
 very
 yeah
 very
 honest
 and


okay
 so
 banks
 you
 don't
 do
 it.
 What
 else


do
 you
 do?
 And
 the
 other
 reason
 for


banks
 is
 very
 important.
 You
 know
 that


sooner
 or
 later
 you
 may


find
 someone
 without
 a
 lot
 of


intelligence
 comes
 to
 run
 them
 and
 then


it
 can
 be
 toxic.
 Yeah.
 People
 going
 for


growth.
 AngloIrish
 bank
 if
 you
 remember


that
 one.
 Yeah.
 Of
 course.
 And
 they
 just


uh
 can
 destroy
 the


shareholders.
 Yeah.


uh


by
 getting
 uh
 bonuses,
 you
 know,
 bare


sterns,
 you


know,
 and
 non-alignment
 of
 interests


with
 leverage
 and
 uh
 opacity


and
 uh
 and
 uh
 so
 what
 are
 the
 other


others?
 Oh.
 Oh.
 Many
 the
 auto
 industry


is
 obviously
 a
 commodity,
 retail,
 you


know,
 um


insurance,


um
 the
 um
 commodities,
 the
 uh
 commodity


manufacturing,
 tobacco,
 the
 the
 truth
 is


uh
 yeah,
 anything
 in
 in
 in
 most
 things


in
 manufacturing.
 Okay.
 So
 So
 most


industries
 most
 industries
 are
 bad


industries.
 Yeah.
 So
 Chris,
 it
 doesn't


leave
 it
 doesn't
 leave
 a
 big
 universe.


Correct.
 We
 say
 maybe
 there's
 200


companies
 that
 we
 consider
 to
 be
 um
 high


quality
 and
 investable.
 Um
 and
 um
 I
 mean


I'll
 list
 you
 a
 couple
 more.
 Traditional


asset
 managers,
 bad
 businesses.
 Yeah,


speaking
 as
 one.
 Um
 uh
 fossil
 fuel


utilities,
 bad
 businesses.
 Airlines,
 bad


businesses.
 Um
 wireless
 telecom,
 bad


businesses.
 We
 think
 media
 is
 bad.
 um


advertising
 agencies,
 you
 know,
 it's
 a


very
 long
 list.
 Why?
 Because
 it's


competitive
 and
 with
 existing
 players


and
 new
 technologies.
 And
 the
 one


important
 thing
 that
 um
 I've
 learned
 in


my
 time
 in
 investing
 is
 investors


underestimate
 the
 forces
 of
 competition


and
 disruption
 because
 they
 just
 look


today.
 Maybe
 there's
 a
 new
 company
 which


has
 a
 first
 mover


advantage
 but
 then
 competition
 comes


in.
 Yeah.
 substitution
 and
 and
 uh
 um


where
 does
 it
 where
 does
 it
 leave
 the


big
 US
 tech
 companies
 now?
 Yeah.
 So


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 power
 of
 incumbency.


This
 is
 another
 important
 point.
 So


let's
 take
 a
 company
 um
 Microsoft.
 Okay.


Which
 we've
 invested
 in
 um
 and
 uh
 one
 of


their
 barriers
 to
 entry
 is


um
 bundling.
 Okay.
 or
 the
 or
 or
 maybe


because
 of
 it's
 it's
 it's
 it it
 um
 it


creates
 a
 customer
 switching
 cost.
 What


what
 do
 I
 mean
 by
 this?
 So,
 the
 office


franchise
 which
 we're
 all
 familiar
 with


has
 many
 um
 products
 in
 it,
 you
 know,


your
 your
 applications,
 word
 processing,


Excel,
 your
 email,


um


security,
 different
 things.
 And
 they
 and


they
 sell
 it
 as
 a
 bundle.
 Yep.
 they


don't
 disagregate
 it.


And
 when
 a
 new


um
 product
 or
 a
 potential
 competitor


enters


um
 they
 can
 add
 it
 to
 the
 bundle.
 So


Zoom
 came
 out
 with
 video


conferencing
 and
 they
 could
 have


potentially
 you
 know
 added
 all
 the


things
 Microsoft
 does
 to
 that.
 So,


Microsoft
 had
 to
 respond
 and
 they


launched


Teams
 and
 they
 were
 able
 to
 distribute


it
 through
 the
 bundle.
 Yeah.
 free
 to


everybody.
 And
 even
 though


Zoom
 some
 people
 believe
 it
 was
 a
 better


product
 or
 is
 a
 better


product,
 Microsoft
 won
 that


battle
 because
 they
 had
 the
 installed


base,
 the
 incumbency
 which
 we
 talked


about
 and
 high
 switching
 costs
 for
 um


because
 once
 people
 are
 using
 their


their
 office
 software,
 they
 don't
 want


to
 switch
 and
 so
 people
 started
 using


Teams.
 Okay.


something
 given
 to
 you
 free.
 Why?


Because
 it
 was
 good
 enough.
 Yeah.
 It


didn't
 have
 to
 be
 the
 best
 if


I
 if
 it's
 free.
 Yeah.
 What
 about
 the


other
 tech
 companies?
 We
 have
 a
 a


position
 in
 Alphabet
 and
 uh
 which
 is
 um


maybe
 our
 most
 risky
 investment


um
 um
 where
 there
 clearly
 the
 company


it's
 just
 one
 of
 our
 smallest


investments
 as
 a
 result.
 It's
 it's
 um


and
 where
 we
 have
 some
 level
 of


protection
 because
 it
 there
 are


businesses
 like
 YouTube
 and
 and
 and


their
 cloud
 business
 which
 represent


half
 the
 market
 cap
 today
 and
 the
 cash


and
 and
 other
 things.
 So
 um
 it
 isn't
 all


search
 but
 search
 is
 is
 critical
 and
 uh


and
 so
 can
 they
 out
 innovate
 um


competition?
 Yeah
 there's
 a
 risk
 of


search
 fragmenting
 you
 know
 as


competitors
 come
 in
 uh
 and
 try
 to
 but
 um


it's
 a
 question
 mark.
 Yeah
 we
 don't


think
 so.
 We
 think
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 of


advantages
 of
 their
 data
 to
 have
 to
 uh


offer
 higher
 quality
 um
 search


results
 and


um
 but
 competition
 is
 increasing.


Talking
 of
 which
 how
 do
 you
 think
 AI


will
 change
 the
 investment
 landscape


here?
 It's
 going
 to
 increase
 uh


disruption
 in
 in in
 in
 ways
 we
 can't


even
 predict.
 But
 there
 are
 uh
 things


like
 call
 centers
 un
 will
 will
 all
 go


bankrupt.
 And
 uh
 another
 segment
 is


Indian
 outsourcing
 companies.
 Yep.
 Who


do
 coding
 and
 and
 and
 uh
 things
 like


that.
 um
 demand
 for
 those


services
 could


collapse
 because
 AI
 can
 do
 coding
 you


know
 at
 at
 w
 with
 half
 the
 people.
 Yeah.


Mhm.
 Yep.
 So,
 so
 there
 are
 but
 AI
 will


will
 increase
 the
 productivity
 and
 lower


the
 cost
 base
 of
 all
 all
 companies


and
 so
 if
 you
 have
 a
 company
 with
 these


barriers
 to
 entry
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 worth


more
 I
 think
 uh
 for
 generally


competitive
 businesses
 if
 you
 don't
 lead


you
 could
 become
 uncompetitive


and
 be
 disrupted.
 Yeah.
 So
 now
 um
 we


have
 identified
 one
 of
 these
 companies


let's
 say
 I
 don't
 know
 Ayena
 or


Rolls-Royce
 or
 Microsoft.
 How
 do
 you


value
 these
 companies?
 What
 what
 is
 your


valuation
 tool?
 Are
 you
 we
 don't
 even


look
 at
 that
 until
 we
 get
 comfortable


that
 the
 barriers
 are
 so
 strong
 it
 will


be
 around
 now.
 Okay.
 So
 barriers
 fine
 we


think
 it
 will
 be
 around.
 Yeah.
 We
 think


it'll
 be
 around.
 We
 think
 there
 will


continue
 to
 be
 an
 airport
 in
 Madrid.


Right.
 We'll
 do
 reference
 checks
 on


um
 relevant
 people.
 Okay.
 So,
 and
 see
 if


we're
 missing
 something.
 So,
 we
 when
 we


were
 looking
 at
 investing
 in
 aircraft


engines
 with
 uh
 we
 spoke
 to
 the
 a
 CEO
 of


a
 former
 CEO
 of
 one
 of
 the
 the
 the


competitive
 companies
 and
 he
 confirmed


their
 thesis
 and
 and
 and
 actually
 said


the
 margins
 should
 be
 much
 much
 higher.


Okay.
 Okay.
 And
 over
 time
 they
 they
 will


go
 there.
 So
 that
 that's
 uh
 one
 of
 the


pieces
 of
 diligence.
 Um
 we
 will
 assess


management
 where
 I
 think
 it's
 important


but
 not
 critical
 if
 you
 have
 the
 right


assets.
 Um
 through
 ideally
 through


through
 meeting
 them
 um
 uh
 the
 the
 uh


talk
 to


competitors
 get
 their
 view.


Um
 and
 um


um
 look
 at
 competitive
 companies,
 look


at
 the
 track
 record
 of
 the
 company
 and


usually
 you
 don't
 understand
 everything


and
 usually
 the
 things
 you
 find
 out
 are


are
 bad
 things
 and
 um
 I
 think
 we'll


discuss
 it
 with
 our
 team
 and
 we
 want
 to


hear


competing
 views.
 Yeah,
 we
 have
 some


members
 of
 team
 are
 just
 inherently


bearish.
 Yeah.
 And
 they're
 they're
 good


for
 testing
 the
 bare
 case.
 We
 always


want
 to
 hear
 how
 could
 technology


disrupt.
 Yeah.
 And
 and
 just
 what


competition
 and
 um
 are
 you
 a
 bearish


guy?


Um
 not
 particularly.
 No,
 I
 I've
 um
 Yeah.


What
 but
 what
 kind
 of
 valuation
 metrics


do
 you
 do
 you
 look
 at
 PS
 cash
 flows?
 Do


you
 do
 DCFS?
 So
 you
 have
 like
 50
 page


spreadsheets,
 all
 of
 those,
 right?
 All


of
 those,
 but
 not
 50
 pages,
 you
 know,


that's
 that's
 uh
 uh
 but
 a
 very
 But


really
 honestly
 um
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we


learned
 is
 there's
 a
 really
 important


point
 is
 that
 we
 can
 have
 an
 advantage


through
 long-
 termism.
 Mhm.
 Okay.
 Which


is
 the
 average
 stock
 is
 held
 by
 an


institutional
 investor
 by
 under
 a
 year


or
 the
 stock
 market
 in
 the
 US.
 How
 long


do
 you
 hold
 it?
 Average
 holding
 period


of
 our
 port
 current


portfolio
 is
 eight
 years.
 Eight
 years.


Yeah.
 That's
 Yeah.
 Eight
 years.
 I'm
 not


saying
 that's
 the
 limit.
 It's
 just


uh


the
 we've
 on
 average
 some
 we've
 held
 for


13
 years.
 Some
 new
 investments
 like
 G


aerospace
 two
 years
 but
 the
 average


weighted
 average
 holding
 period
 is
 eight


years.
 Yeah.
 So
 but
 it
 could
 be
 10,
 it


could
 be
 20.
 So
 I
 I
 love
 long
 term,


right?
 But
 how
 do
 you
 install
 that
 type


of
 thinking
 into
 your
 organization?
 I


mean
 we
 don't
 straight
 out
 of
 business


school
 out
 of
 business
 school.
 You
 want


to
 hey
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 went
 to
 Harvard


like
 you
 did
 or
 whatever.
 It's
 just
 like


hey
 let's
 do
 some
 stuff.
 Come
 on
 let's


do
 some
 stuff.
 Yeah.
 And
 it's
 just
 like,


hey,
 okay,
 let's
 buy
 something
 and
 hold


it
 for
 8
 years,
 right?
 You
 come
 home
 to


your
 partner
 every
 day.
 It's
 just
 like


they
 do
 nothing.
 Then
 you
 we
 really
 um


you
 know,
 if
 you
 are
 in
 the
 private


equity
 world,
 that's
 normal.
 Yeah.
 A


private
 equity
 fund
 would
 hold
 an


investment
 for
 their
 10-year
 life
 funds


normally.
 Yeah.
 Or
 longer.
 12
 years.


Yeah.
 As
 as
 you
 know.
 And


so
 and
 so
 we
 we
 it's
 a
 it's
 an
 overused


expression
 for
 some
 or
 misused.
 We
 take


a
 private
 equity
 approach
 i.e.
 that
 we


have
 to
 hold
 the
 company
 forever
 because


you
 you
 the
 stock
 market
 maybe
 at
 at


very
 uh
 bad
 prices
 when
 you
 want
 to


sell.
 Yeah.
 if
 you
 need
 to
 sell
 and
 and


and
 so
 I
 really
 think
 you
 you
 need
 to


have
 that
 approach
 and
 um
 and
 so
 the
 way


we
 we
 really
 like
 a
 long-term
 valuation


is


DCF
 the
 most
 important


things
 and
 here's
 the
 thing
 DCF
 you
 take


the
 cash
 flow
 and
 you
 discount
 it
 today.


Yeah.
 But
 here's
 the
 thing
 is
 is
 and
 the


the


um
 the
 longer
 you
 can
 look
 out
 if
 you've


got
 a
 great
 company
 the
 more
 valuable


value
 there
 is.
 Take
 a
 company
 we
 own


Moody's.


Moody's
 a
 rating
 a
 rating
 agency.
 So


it's
 been
 around
 100
 years.
 What
 do
 you


think
 the
 average
 I
 can
 ask
 you
 a


question.
 Make
 it
 fun.
 What
 do
 you
 think


the
 average
 revenue
 growth
 over
 that
 100


years
 has
 been?
 Uh
 I'm
 going
 to
 look


like
 a
 total
 fool,
 but
 uh
 100
 years is


long
 time.
 7%.
 10.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 You
 know,


a
 very
 that's
 a
 very
 unusual
 number
 over


a
 very
 long
 time
 period.
 And
 so


investors
 have
 always
 underestimated
 his


value,
 including
 myself.
 Yeah.
 And
 um
 I


bought
 the
 stock
 during
 the
 financial


crisis
 at
 10
 times
 earnings
 and
 then
 and


then
 I
 even
 bought
 shares
 Warren
 Buffett


was
 selling
 a
 and
 reduced
 his
 stake
 from


25%
 to
 I
 think
 he's
 got
 15%
 and
 um


butcher
 and
 uh
 the
 are
 you
 kind
 of
 are


you
 kind
 of
 secretly
 pleased
 having


bought
 something
 cheap
 from
 Warren


Buffett?
 Yeah,
 but
 then
 I
 sold
 it.
 I


doubled
 I
 doubled
 my
 money.
 I
 went
 from


10
 times
 earnings
 to
 20
 and
 I
 and
 I
 sold


it.
 uh
 at
 $100,
 bought
 it
 at
 50,
 sold
 at


100.
 I
 thought
 I
 was
 clever
 and
 then
 but


the
 earnings
 kept
 compounding.
 So
 you


buy
 back
 I
 bought
 it
 back
 at
 $150.
 So


now
 it's
 recently
 $500,
 now
 $400.
 So


it's
 it's
 it's
 because
 actually
 the


intrinsic
 value
 compounding
 matters
 more


than
 the
 stock
 price.
 If
 you
 have
 a


great
 company,
 it
 will
 grow
 intrinsic


value.
 Absolutely.
 And
 the
 multiple


here's
 the
 thing
 about
 the
 multiples.


they
 matter


less
 than
 the
 growth
 when


you
 look
 at
 it
 over
 a
 longer
 period.
 But


most


investors
 are
 unwilling
 or
 unable
 to


invest
 on
 a
 long-term
 time
 horizon


because
 either
 they
 don't
 know
 what


they're
 doing,
 which


interestingly
 goes
 uh
 back
 to
 what
 War


they
 think
 it's
 risky,
 which
 goes
 back


to
 what
 Warren
 Buffett
 was
 when
 he
 was


asked
 what
 the
 definition
 of
 risk
 was.


You
 know
 what
 he
 said?
 not
 knowing
 what


you're
 doing.
 So
 really
 good
 nugget
 here


is
 that
 if
 you
 buy
 something
 which
 is


really
 good,
 it
 doesn't
 quite
 matter


what
 you
 pay
 for
 it
 because
 it
 will
 grow


and
 secondary
 over
 a
 long
 uh
 well
 I
 say


the
 let's
 just
 say
 it
 like
 this
 the


multiple
 to
 a
 point.
 Yeah.
 Whether
 you


buy
 buy
 it
 at
 if
 it's
 growing
 it's
 all


maths.
 Yep.
 You've
 got
 to
 look
 at
 the


growth
 rate
 the
 terminal
 multiple
 the


all
 the
 mult
 things.
 But
 if
 it's


increasing
 intrinsic
 value
 at
 a
 at
 a
 at


a
 at
 a
 good
 rate,
 you
 will
 undervalue
 it


if
 you
 look
 at
 it
 over
 a
 short
 horizon.


Yep.
 I
 can
 be
 saying
 it
 like
 that.
 And


if
 you're
 if
 you're
 willing
 to
 hold
 it


for
 a
 long
 term
 and
 extract
 that


intrinsic
 value
 growth,
 it'll
 be
 worth


to
 me
 more
 to
 you
 than
 other
 people.


I've
 heard
 you
 say
 that
 there
 are
 more


good
 companies
 in
 the
 public
 market
 than


in
 the
 private
 market.
 Yes.
 Why
 do
 you


say
 that?


because
 the
 companies
 that
 that
 um
 that


are
 sold


by
 to
 private


equity
 are
 the
 ones
 that
 aren't
 as
 good.


Yeah.
 People
 Are
 you
 sure?
 I
 mean,
 how


do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you
 base
 what


you
 say?
 Not
 that
 I
 don't
 Let's
 dig
 into


it.
 Let's
 dig
 into
 it.
 I
 know
 it
 upsets


people
 who
 are
 private
 equity
 at
 all.
 I


mean,
 we
 actually
 uh
 I'm
 pretty


pragmatic
 about
 this,
 but
 why
 do
 you


where
 do
 you
 get


back?
 I
 happen
 to
 think
 that
 large


companies
 are
 more
 likely
 to
 beat
 small


companies
 in
 an
 industry.
 They
 have
 more


money
 to
 compete.
 Y
 and
 um
 a
 a
 and


um
 in
 R&D.
 Yep.
 And
 scale.
 We
 talked


earlier
 about
 scale
 being
 key
 and


incumbency
 being
 key


um
 a
 and
 switching
 costs.
 So


um
 yeah,
 we
 we
 we


we
 think
 it's
 an
 a
 small
 company
 that


invents
 something


new.
 We
 talked
 about
 Zoom.
 I
 it
 can
 be


crushed
 by
 a
 large
 company
 reasonably


easily.
 They
 can
 copy
 and
 large


companies
 are
 usually,
 you
 know,
 too
 big


for
 private
 equity.
 private
 equity
 can't


buy


Visa,
 you
 know,
 they
 they
 they
 it's
 too


big
 for
 them.
 Yep.
 So
 that
 that's
 size


excludes
 private
 equity
 from
 large


companies.
 Um
 and


um
 and
 if
 a
 public
 company
 is
 selling


something
 to
 private
 equity,
 usually


they're
 not
 selling
 their
 best


businesses.
 Yep.
 A
 and
 I'd
 say
 um
 um


private


equity
 like
 all
 asset


management
 is
 prone
 to


um
 uh
 the
 principal
 agency
 problem
 where


they
 are
 incentivized
 to
 gather
 assets.


Let's
 just
 say
 say
 it
 like
 this.
 The


very
 best
 businesses
 in
 the
 public


markets
 I
 believe
 are
 better
 than
 the


top
 100
 companies
 are
 better
 than
 the


top
 100
 companies
 in
 private
 equity.


Okay.
 Yep.
 Yep.
 When
 do
 you
 sell
 a


company?
 When
 it's
 a
 view
 of
 intrinsic


value
 is
 not
 as
 good
 as
 uh
 other
 things


including
 including
 not
 just
 value
 but


conviction.
 So
 our
 philosophy


There
 are
 two
 components
 to
 it
 if
 you


like
 intrinsic
 value.
 Yeah.
 So
 the
 price


still
 has
 to
 be
 at
 or
 above
 at
 or
 below


intrinsic
 value.
 But
 there's
 a
 second


point
 which
 isn't


um
 really
 um
 focused
 on
 by
 many


investors
 which


is
 conviction.
 So
 you
 so
 you
 lose
 faith


you
 lose
 faith
 in
 them.
 No,
 I'm
 saying


you
 need
 to
 have
 conviction
 when
 you


invest
 in
 something
 at
 all
 times.
 Yeah.


And
 what
 does
 that
 mean?
 You
 could
 call


it
 confidence.
 What
 does
 that
 word
 mean?


Because
 there
 there's
 a
 saying
 talk
 is


cheap.
 You
 can
 say


um
 the
 this


uh
 and
 you
 can
 be
 wrong.
 Okay.
 And


so
 my
 one
 of
 my
 first
 investments
 uh


when
 I
 worked
 in
 New
 York
 for
 a
 hedge


fund
 before
 starting
 TCI
 was
 in
 an


Italian
 media
 company
 and
 uh
 Bane


Capital
 bought
 control.
 It
 was
 like
 a


billion
 euro


valuation
 and
 it
 went
 to
 a
 50
 billion


euro
 valuation
 and
 then
 went
 to
 zero.
 It


was
 a
 yellow
 pages
 company
 which
 say
 it.


Yeah,
 you
 remember
 it.
 And
 uh
 the
 the


and
 when
 I
 first
 invested
 the
 internet


didn't
 exist
 and
 uh
 people
 thought


yellow
 pages
 were
 a
 monopoly
 and
 and and


and
 they


were
 a
 and


so
 the
 point
 is
 you
 can
 be
 wrong
 and


certain


industries
 your
 risk
 of
 being
 wrong
 are


higher.
 M
 technology
 is
 one
 of
 those


areas.
 Absolutely.
 But
 if
 I
 own
 an


airport
 y
 that
 is
 or
 a
 toll
 road,
 let's


take
 a
 toll
 roads
 in
 that
 are


unregulated
 which
 there
 there
 are
 there


are
 uh
 some
 that
 we


own.
 I'm
 less
 likely
 to
 be
 wrong
 than
 if


I
 own
 a
 retailer.
 Yeah.
 My
 my
 chances
 of


being
 wrong
 be
 are
 are
 less
 because
 I


have
 physical
 asset
 backing
 substitution


risk.


So
 um
 the
 thesis
 is
 much
 more
 obvious.


Yeah.
 Because
 so
 the


um
 and
 so
 this
 uh
 this
 concept
 of


conviction
 is
 is
 very
 important.
 One


investor
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 said
 to
 me,
 I
 have


to
 be
 able
 to
 sleep
 at
 night.
 It
 has
 to


be
 so
 sufficiently
 obvious.


Um,
 which
 but
 you
 always
 have,
 you
 know,


kind
 of
 sounds
 contradictory
 to
 to


saying
 that
 you
 you
 you
 you
 can
 be
 wrong


because
 what
 kills
 you
 as
 an
 investor
 is


permanent
 loss
 of
 capital.
 Absolutely.
 I


got
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 problem
 with
 the
 concept


of
 uh
 intrinsic
 value
 as
 if
 there
 were


some
 kind
 of
 objective
 truth.
 Yeah,


you're
 you're
 right.
 You're
 right.
 It's


it's
 it's
 you


know,
 we
 can't
 tell
 the
 forecast
 the


future.
 So
 to
 to
 a
 high
 degree
 of


accuracy
 you
 can
 just
 say
 which
 is
 why


um
 you
 can
 and
 the
 longer
 you
 look
 out


the
 harder
 it
 is.
 Um
 and
 so
 we
 we
 look


at
 more
 simpler
 tests
 sometimes.
 Will


the
 business
 be
 around?
 Yep.
 Will
 we


still
 fly
 airplanes
 in
 in
 in
 30
 years


and
 and
 and
 and
 you
 know
 will
 we
 want


airline
 travel?
 Will
 there
 be
 demand
 for


it?
 And
 um
 so
 once
 you
 know
 so
 I
 agree


with
 you.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 that
 valuation
 is


is
 just
 approximate
 you
 know
 we
 can
 just


say
 in
 truth
 with
 con
 with
 confidence
 we


have
 a
 a
 good
 or
 great
 business
 okay
 and


and
 as
 I'm
 saying
 only
 a
 small
 subset
 of


businesses
 can
 be
 predicted


which
 are
 the
 most
 powerful
 ones
 but


exactly
 how
 they
 grow


and
 you
 know
 unexpected
 events
 you're


right
 there
 there's
 no
 um
 there's
 no


certainty.
 Let's
 move
 on
 to
 from
 uh


companies
 to
 investors.
 Uh
 and
 in
 terms


of
 what
 makes
 a
 good
 investor,
 why
 are


you
 a
 good
 investor?
 Well,
 I
 it's
 your


words.
 Um
 it's
 important
 to
 have


humility.
 Um
 but


um
 there
 was


uh
 someone
 I
 knew
 who
 took
 me
 aside
 once


and
 he
 said,


"Chris,
 you
 and
 I,
 he
 he
 did
 reasonably


well."
 He
 said, "We
 weren't
 the
 best


investors.
 we
 just
 took
 the
 most


risk.
 So
 I
 just
 uh
 which
 is
 which
 is
 not


true
 actually.
 Yeah,
 it
 was
 he
 was
 uh
 it


was
 an
 interesting
 comment
 that
 makes


you
 sometimes
 when
 people
 say
 a
 joke
 you


or
 something
 you
 you
 wonder
 is
 it
 true?


But
 uh


um
 I
 was
 always
 willing
 to
 look
 at
 the


company
 fundamentals
 and
 not
 the
 try
 to


guess
 the
 stock
 market.
 Okay.
 and
 um
 and


and
 focus
 on
 macro
 or
 trading.
 Yeah.
 So


I
 was
 always
 fundamental.
 Most
 investors


are
 not
 fundamental.
 They
 trade


actively.
 They
 look
 at
 data
 points.
 They


say
 what's
 the
 catalyst.
 They
 don't


really
 know
 what
 the
 the
 company
 does.


So
 I
 think
 the
 fundamental
 approach
 has


been
 key.
 Long-termism
 is


key.
 Okay.
 Uh
 um
 uh
 another
 thing
 we've


done
 is
 concentration.
 We've
 owned
 a
 few


things.
 Yeah.
 We
 may
 have
 10%
 type


holdings,
 10
 10
 stocks,
 you
 know,
 15


stocks.
 We
 don't
 own
 a
 100
 things.
 And
 I


think
 another
 key
 point
 is
 intuition.
 We


work
 with
 intuition,
 which
 is
 something


that
 is
 uh
 people
 find
 strange.
 How
 do


you
 use
 intuition?


It's


uh
 it's
 been
 defined
 as
 thinking
 without


thinking
 which
 is
 um
 the
 Buddhists
 would


call
 a
 coan
 something
 that
 just
 doesn't


make
 sense.
 We
 will
 come
 back
 to
 your


Buddhist
 thoughts
 later


on
 but


it's
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't
 understand


what
 intuition
 is.
 It's
 it's
 it's
 sort


of
 uh
 well
 opposite
 I
 have
 I
 happen
 to


have
 written
 my
 master's
 dissertation
 on


this
 exact
 topic
 but
 so
 you're
 you're


one
 who
 does
 then
 it's
 sort
 of
 the


opposite
 of
 intellect
 and
 uh
 so
 well


pattern
 recognition
 in
 a
 way
 you've
 seen


it
 before.
 Yeah
 that's
 there's
 a
 word


for
 it
 knowing.
 Okay
 it's
 it's
 it's
 all


the
 opposite
 of
 intellect.
 Of
 course,


we'll
 do
 analysis,
 but
 but
 then


um
 it's
 a
 higher
 level
 of
 intelligence


than
 just
 intellect.
 But
 do
 you
 what
 do


you
 have
 intuition
 about?
 Do
 you
 have


the
 intuition
 about
 the
 people,
 the


situation?
 What
 is
 it?
 All
 of
 it.
 Okay.


All
 of
 it.
 Is
 someone
 trustworthy
 or
 not


trustworthy?
 And
 uh
 the
 the
 patterns


patterns
 are
 another
 thing.
 And
 uh
 so


you
 know
 we
 were
 we
 don't
 do
 we
 rarely


short
 but
 we
 were
 short
 wire
 cut.
 Yeah
 I


know
 we're
 coming
 back
 to
 that.
 Yeah.


And
 uh
 but
 the
 uh
 is
 your
 intuition
 now


better
 than
 it
 was
 when
 you
 were


younger?
 Yeah.
 I
 was
 not
 in


intuition
 so
 much
 before
 the
 last
 5
 to


10
 years.
 It's
 been
 a
 a
 a
 change.
 But
 I


think
 I
 always
 operated
 with
 at
 a
 at
 an


intuitive
 level
 and
 and
 it's
 not
 just


stock
 picking.
 when
 I
 decided
 to
 start


my
 own
 fund


um
 you
 know
 21
 years
 ago
 I
 just
 had
 this


intuition
 that
 um
 I
 was
 in
 the
 wrong


place
 and
 uh
 not
 doing
 what
 I
 was
 meant


to
 do
 and
 it
 wasn't
 about
 money
 or


anything
 but
 it's
 it's
 it's
 when
 you


know
 you
 when


I
 met


uh
 uh
 my
 my
 my
 wife
 Kylie
 you
 know
 you


just
 you
 just
 there's
 a
 point
 where
 you


just
 know.
 Yeah.
 It
 isn't
 an


intellectual
 thing,
 you
 know.
 There
 is


But
 Chris,
 this
 is
 called
 this
 is
 called


love.
 This
 is
 something
 else.


Well,
 yeah.
 Love
 is
 not
 in
 the
 mind,
 but


love
 should
 be
 intuitive.
 Yeah.
 But
 it's


an
 example.
 Yeah.
 Do
 you
 believe
 do
 you


believe
 in
 So
 if
 I
 if
 I'm
 your


colleague,
 so
 I
 work
 now
 for
 you.
 I'm
 a


junior
 analyst.
 I
 came
 to
 I
 come
 to
 you


and
 I
 say, "Hey,
 Chris,
 I
 got
 this


intuition.
 I
 think
 this
 looks
 really


good.
 Will
 you
 believe
 me?"
 No,
 I'll


I'll
 uh
 the
 the
 u
 because
 the
 thing
 you


said
 people
 have
 to
 to
 we
 don't
 work


like
 here's
 the
 difference
 is
 I
 I
 I've


been
 a
 stock
 picker.
 So
 a
 lot
 of


portfolio
 managers
 aren't
 portfolio


managers
 they're
 managers
 of
 managers.


Oh
 and
 they
 say
 people
 like
 that
 say
 to


me
 there's
 only
 two


truths
 which
 is
 not
 the
 story
 that
 I


hear
 but
 the
 P&L
 and
 the
 stop-loss.


Yeah.
 Because
 they
 can't
 analyze
 the


company
 themselves.
 M
 so
 no
 we
 never


take
 anything
 from
 anybody
 at
 face
 value


and
 we
 we
 work
 in
 a
 team
 that's


something
 we
 didn't
 mention
 earlier
 but


uh
 the
 um
 the
 point
 is
 just
 a
 story
 is


just
 a
 story
 yeah
 what
 you
 have
 to
 focus


on
 what
 matters
 okay


because
 there
 was


a
 a
 spiritual
 teacher
 actually
 said


something
 that
 applies
 to
 investing
 he


said
 very
 few
 things
 matter
 and
 most


things
 matter
 don't
 matter
 at
 all.
 Okay.


So,
 you
 can
 and
 investing
 it's
 actually


similar.
 Yeah.
 You
 can
 you
 need
 to
 get


out
 of
 the
 noise
 and
 just
 focus
 on
 the


handful
 of
 things
 that
 matter.
 Is
 it
 is


it
 talent
 or
 can
 it
 be
 trained
 to
 become


a
 good
 investor?


I
 think
 it
 can
 be
 trained.
 Yeah.
 There's


a
 judgment
 element
 of
 it.
 I
 think
 it
 can


be
 trained
 um
 for
 for
 sure.
 No,
 we
 have


we
 both
 have
 taken
 inspiration
 from
 some


of
 the
 same
 people,
 right?
 One
 of
 them


is
 John
 who
 I
 worked
 with.
 Yes.
 I
 love


John.
 I
 love
 John.
 He's
 I
 consider
 him
 a


friend.
 Yeah.
 When
 I
 was
 just
 starting


out,
 he
 he
 really
 uh
 he's
 a
 great


investor
 and
 he
 took
 me
 under
 his
 wing
 a


little
 bit
 and
 uh
 cuz
 I
 didn't
 know


anything
 and
 uh
 we
 we
 had
 the
 same


couple
 of
 same
 stocks.
 The
 energy
 group


was
 one
 and
 I
 I
 I
 I
 I
 I
 didn't
 have
 the


experience
 to
 know.
 and
 say
 you
 you


would
 probably
 say
 you
 know
 that
 knowing


and
 intuition
 comes
 with
 experience
 to


to
 but
 um
 yeah
 and
 uh
 so
 yeah
 I'm
 I'm
 a


fan
 of
 John's.
 Yeah
 because
 most
 of
 the


things
 I
 know
 about
 investments
 I


learned
 from
 him
 and
 his
 partner
 Bill


Bullinger.
 So
 we
 have
 some
 of
 the
 we


have
 some
 of
 the
 same
 teachers
 here.
 Uh


moving
 on
 a
 bit.
 Uh
 so
 you
 are
 uh
 or
 you


were
 you
 know
 perhaps
 more
 considered
 an


activist
 investor.
 Yes.
 So
 what
 in
 your


in
 your
 view
 what
 is
 an
 activist


investor
 doing?
 It's
 it's
 a


spectrum
 uh
 and


from
 fullblown
 hardcore
 removing
 boards


and
 CEOs
 and
 uh
 and
 uh
 demanding
 the


sale
 of
 a
 company
 to


um
 um
 call
 it
 uh
 soft
 activism,
 softer


activism
 of
 trying
 to
 have
 relationship


and
 dialogue
 with
 the
 company
 at
 a


professional
 level
 a
 a
 and
 where
 you


understand
 their
 their
 mindset
 and
 their


thinking
 of
 the
 business.
 So
 so
 and
 um


uh
 and
 engage
 okay
 and
 that
 could
 mean


many
 things.
 It
 doesn't


uh
 you
 know


uh
 I'd
 say
 today
 our
 relationships
 are


very
 uh
 generally
 very
 constructive
 with


companies.
 So
 but
 it
 wasn't
 always
 that


way.
 Yeah,
 it
 wasn't.
 We
 I I
 learned


you've
 gone
 kind
 of
 from
 having
 been
 an


aggressive
 tiger
 to
 becoming
 a
 bit
 more


of
 a
 Yeah.
 you
 know
 big
 uh
 lion.
 Yeah.


Though
 no
 one
 thought
 like
 that
 when
 we


started
 the
 fund
 and
 when
 we
 named
 it


the
 children's
 investment
 fund.
 We


thought
 how
 are
 we
 going
 to
 compete
 with


Tiger
 and
 Viking
 and
 more
 aggressive


named
 funds.
 But
 um
 yeah
 it
 is
 true.


I've
 learned
 that
 actually
 activism,


hardcore


activism
 is
 not
 a
 a
 a
 great
 thing.
 Uh


why
 not?
 Yeah,
 it's
 very
 difficult
 to


succeed
 because
 the
 vast
 proponents
 of


today's
 investor
 base
 are
 you
 passive


who
 don't
 actually


uh
 to
 get
 them
 to
 vote
 for
 something
 is


very
 difficult
 and
 uh
 um
 and
 all
 the


power
 you
 know


the
 and
 and
 so
 active
 management
 is


dying
 and
 so
 when
 I
 started
 there
 was


very
 little
 indexation
 and
 so
 there
 was


a
 more
 engaged
 active
 share
 base
 and
 now


indexation
 has


um
 limited
 the
 power
 of
 of
 shareholders.


But
 I
 mean
 you
 were
 one
 of the
 most


fared
 people
 in
 Europe.
 Yeah.


But
 I
 was
 buying
 bad
 businesses
 uh
 long


ago
 like
 ABN
 AMRO
 putting
 up
 for
 sale
 uh


through
 putting
 on
 the
 AGM
 of
 Oats
 to


sell
 the
 company
 and
 we
 made
 a
 lot
 of


money.
 who
 made
 a
 billion
 dollars


forcing
 the
 sale
 of
 it.
 But
 in
 truth,


the
 company
 was
 worthless,
 but
 was


bought
 for
 hundred
 billion
 from
 three


companies
 who
 all
 went
 bankrupt.
 Royal


Bank
 of
 Scotland,
 Foris,
 and
 Onventtor.


So,
 they
 didn't
 know
 what
 we
 they
 were


doing.
 We
 didn't
 know
 what
 we
 were


doing.
 And
 it
 was
 all


um


uh
 you
 know,
 a
 madness.
 It
 was
 a
 but
 it


it
 made
 money.


But
 for
 those
 who
 sold
 um
 but
 in


truth
 the
 fundamentals
 were
 were


were
 would
 trump
 everything.
 So
 a
 lot
 of


activists
 end
 up
 being


activists
 in
 in
 in
 bad
 businesses.
 Yeah.


But
 are
 you
 have
 you
 stopped
 being
 an


activist
 because
 you
 are
 more
 attracted


to
 good
 companies
 or
 because
 you
 can't


take
 control?
 The
 business
 always
 wins.


Yeah.
 Okay.


So
 it's
 pointless
 being
 an
 activist
 in
 a


in
 a
 B
 be B


business
 and


um
 that
 said
 uh
 we
 we
 we
 still
 engage
 in


it
 in
 in
 hardcore
 activism.
 We
 we're
 an


investment
 where
 we
 we
 went
 on
 the
 board


and
 um
 you
 know
 pushed
 out
 you
 know


chairman
 and
 some
 directors
 and
 and
 and


and
 uh
 the
 and
 and
 the
 company's
 doing


much
 better
 now.
 And
 um
 but
 that's
 an


exception
 and


uh
 I'd
 say
 that
 was
 as
 a
 result
 of
 of
 a


disastrous
 case
 in
 the
 company
 where


they
 we
 weren't
 on
 the
 board
 and
 they


they
 couldn't
 appoint
 a
 CEO.
 The
 board


was
 divided
 and
 it
 it
 was
 a
 real
 mess.


What
 kind
 of
 personal
 toll
 does
 it
 take


on
 you
 to
 be
 in
 these
 fights?
 Yeah.
 Let


me
 give
 you
 an
 example.
 A
 few
 years
 ago,


we
 I
 don't
 know
 it
 was
 six
 years
 or
 or


so,
 we
 own
 shares
 in
 Saffron,
 uh
 where


we
 still
 own
 them.
 We've
 held
 them
 for


13
 years.
 And
 um
 it's
 a
 great
 company,


Aircraft
 Engines
 and
 uh
 joint
 venture


with
 G
 Aerospace.
 And
 they
 announced


they
 were
 buying
 a
 company
 called


Zodiac.


And
 we
 thought,
 French
 aerospace


company,
 we
 thought
 the
 price
 was


ridiculous,
 10
 billion
 euros.
 and
 they


wanted
 to
 pay
 in
 shares
 and
 we
 thought


that
 we
 we
 believe
 the
 shares
 were
 half


price.
 So
 they
 were
 paying
 four
 or
 five


times
 the
 the
 the
 intrinsic


value
 and
 we
 undertook
 a
 very
 aggressive


campaign
 and
 um
 threatened
 the


litigation
 and
 demanded
 a
 vote.
 And
 in


the
 in
 the
 end
 the
 company
 the
 target


was
 adding
 multiple
 profit
 warnings
 and


it
 became
 clear
 that
 we
 were
 right
 and


Saffron
 went
 to


Zodiac
 and
 said
 we
 have
 to
 cut
 the
 price


in
 half
 and
 pay
 in
 cash
 because
 TCI
 are


forcing
 us.
 Okay.
 And
 so
 and
 that's
 what


happened.
 the
 stocks
 doubled
 and


um
 a
 and
 but
 we
 were
 sued
 by
 the
 seller


for
 a
 hundred
 million


euros
 both
 me
 and
 my
 general
 counsel


separately.
 He
 said
 Chris
 I'm
 not
 really


sleeping
 much
 at
 night.
 Well,
 you
 can


afford
 it.
 I
 I I
 I
 can't.
 And
 uh
 so


yeah,
 I
 went
 into
 a
 Paris
 court
 and
 you


it's
 not
 for
 the
 faint-hearted
 to
 do


this.
 And
 do
 you
 enjoy
 a
 good
 argument?


No,
 I
 don't
 really
 enjoy
 fighting
 people


any
 anymore.
 I
 never
 really
 did.
 It
 was


it
 was
 a
 um
 it
 was


a
 something
 we
 began
 with
 Deutsche
 Borsa


and
 and
 now
 really
 I'd
 say
 what
 people


call
 activism
 is
 a
 is
 really
 an


exception
 to
 us.
 So
 it's
 like
 why
 did
 we


get
 involved
 in
 that
 zodiac?
 We
 were


already
 a
 shareholder
 and
 something


bad
 came
 out
 of
 the
 blue.
 It's
 like
 you


walk
 home
 and
 someone
 attacks
 you.
 Yeah.


To
 try
 to
 take
 your
 your
 wallet
 and
 you


fight
 back.
 And
 I
 say,
 "Do
 you
 enjoy
 a


fight,
 Nikolai?"
 No,
 but
 I'm
 not
 so
 sure


I
 would
 fight
 back.
 Should
 you
 choose
 to


I
 would
 ask
 you
 that
 question
 is
 you
 you


would
 say,
 "No,
 I
 don't
 enjoy
 fighting.


It's
 just
 I
 had
 no
 choice.
 I
 was


fighting
 for
 my
 life."
 Yeah.
 So,
 I
 put


it
 like
 this.
 We
 act
 as
 owners.


We
 always
 act
 as
 owners.
 What
 does
 that


mean?
 We
 we
 we're
 interested.
 We're


engaged.
 We
 think
 we
 have
 a
 right
 to


um
 appoint
 directors.
 We're
 a
 legal


right
 to
 it.
 And
 and
 we'll
 Yeah.
 And
 so


we
 teach,
 one
 thing
 we
 have
 learned
 is


governance
 does
 matter.
 Which
 brings
 us


to
 kind
 of
 the
 opposite
 wild
 card.
 Mhm.


It's
 a
 bad
 company
 which
 you
 shorted.


And
 shorting
 uh
 just
 for
 those
 people


who
 don't
 know
 it's
 uh
 you
 borrow
 shares


you
 sell
 it


uh
 the
 goal
 is
 that
 the
 share
 price


should
 go
 down
 and
 you
 buy
 them
 back


cheaper
 and
 hand
 them
 back
 right
 and


make
 a
 profit.
 So
 what's
 the
 what
 was
 I


mean
 in
 a
 in
 a
 few
 words
 wild
 card
 what


there
 is
 a
 very
 long
 and
 complicated


high
 level
 we
 learned
 that
 shorting


isn't
 a
 great
 business
 because
 you
 can


be
 right
 but
 not
 be
 able
 to
 hold
 it
 or


fund
 the
 losses.
 Okay.
 So,
 um,
 but
 wire


card
 was
 because
 if
 you
 are
 short
 and


the
 shepherd
 goes
 up,
 you
 basically


unlimited
 downside.
 Yeah.
 And
 you
 have


to
 fund
 the
 losses.
 This
 is
 what
 people


don't
 realize.
 You're
 going
 to
 be


eventually,
 right?
 So,
 the
 first
 guy
 to


short
 Wire
 Guard
 20
 years
 ago
 was
 a
 guy


from
 Bronte


Capital.
 And
 the
 stock
 went
 up
 20
 30


times
 and
 went
 to
 zero.
 But
 he
 was
 when


that
 happened,
 he
 was
 interviewed
 by
 the


media
 and
 they
 said,
 "Congratulations,


you
 you
 were
 right."
 But
 he
 said, "No,
 I


had
 to
 covid-19
 years
 ago.
 I
 couldn't


afford
 to
 to
 to
 to
 fund
 those
 losses."


And
 so
 it's
 you
 have
 to
 understand


investor
 psychology.
 Yeah,
 it's
 tough.


Very
 tough.
 And
 uh
 I
 had
 a
 dinner
 once


with
 Warren
 Buffett
 and
 he
 said
 he
 and


Charlie
 looked
 at
 shorting.
 Yeah.
 They


studied
 it
 and
 they
 just
 said
 it
 was
 too


hard
 because
 of
 that
 point
 of


understanding
 investor


psychology


and
 the
 um
 asymmetric
 risk
 and
 reward


and
 and
 and
 um


so
 it's
 an
 exceptional
 thing
 but
 uh
 we


we
 we
 looked
 at
 Wire
 Card
 and
 uh
 and
 all


the
 accounting
 games
 and
 and


then
 the
 Financial
 Times
 came
 out
 with


all
 these
 articles.
 Yeah.


And
 I
 called
 the
 journalist,
 uh,
 good


guy,
 and
 I
 said,
 "You're
 writing
 all


this
 stuff."
 And,
 uh,
 he
 said,
 "It's
 all


true."
 I
 said,
 "No
 one
 will
 listen
 to


you."
 He
 said,
 "Everything's
 true.
 We


stand
 by
 every
 word."
 And
 and and
 you


just
 you
 could
 literally
 read
 it
 in
 the


paper.
 And
 well,
 the
 whole
 German


establishment
 went
 in
 and
 supported
 the


company.
 That's
 right.
 That's
 right.
 In


fact,
 the
 the
 the
 the
 chairman
 was
 a


former
 CFO
 of
 Deutsche
 Bulser
 and
 uh
 um


in in
 but
 there
 was
 a
 bit
 of
 pattern


recognition
 where
 I
 remember
 uh
 at


Harvard
 Business
 School
 an
 accounting


course
 I
 took
 and
 there
 were
 red
 flags.


Yeah.
 When
 you
 do
 this
 small
 auditor.


Yeah.


Um
 uh
 no
 cash
 flow.
 Yeah.
 Um
 and
 uh


things
 like
 all
 their
 Asian


businesses
 the
 office
 was
 empty.
 Yeah.


Absolutely.
 So
 but
 I
 think
 to
 be
 a
 good


investor
 you
 need
 a
 certain
 independence


of
 thought.
 Totally.
 And
 probably
 to
 be


a
 good
 journalist
 as
 well.
 And
 and


that's
 why
 um
 the
 funny
 thing
 is
 that


the
 fraud
 was
 there
 in
 plain
 sight.
 And


I
 think


um
 I
 learned
 to
 be
 an
 independent


investor
 and
 uh
 the
 and
 so
 we
 went
 to


see
 the
 CEO.
 Actually,
 I


sent
 two
 of
 my
 team
 to
 meet
 him
 and
 uh


and
 they
 came
 back
 incredulous
 at
 this


like
 pathetic
 demonstrations
 of


technology
 and
 uh
 that
 they
 were
 shown.


And
 interestingly
 there
 there
 was
 a
 a


potential
 catalyst
 which
 was
 the
 the
 the


the
 report
 about
 their
 accounting
 and
 uh


in
 the
 end
 they
 just
 said
 it's
 it's


garbage
 and
 uh
 and
 then
 the
 stock
 went


up
 a
 lot
 and
 uh
 so
 actually
 I
 tried
 to


take


um
 uh
 become
 an
 activist
 in
 this


position.
 and
 I
 filed
 a
 a a
 a
 a
 formal


criminal
 complaint
 for
 fraud
 in
 in in


the
 uh
 at
 the
 Munich
 prosecutor's
 office


because
 uh
 they
 said
 if
 I
 didn't
 wasn't


public
 about
 it
 would
 be
 viewed
 as


market
 manipulation.
 So
 we're


transparent
 about
 it
 and
 um
 that
 created


chaos
 but
 it


forced
 some
 actions.
 Yeah.
 you
 you
 you


know
 when
 it


falls
 eventually
 an
 investigation
 and
 uh


and
 so
 um
 because
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 be


like
 Bronty
 Capital
 where
 it
 just
 ran


and
 ran
 and
 so
 at
 some
 point
 it
 really


became
 obvious
 and
 it
 became
 a


confidence
 game.
 I
 think
 that
 um
 people


trust
 authority
 too
 much.
 Okay,
 that


sounds
 a
 strange
 thing,
 but
 they
 trusted


the
 German
 establishment.
 Yeah.
 That
 you


had
 a
 a
 board
 with
 the the
 great
 and
 the


good
 and
 and
 and
 they


weren't
 willing
 to
 believe
 the
 the
 the


journalist.
 So,
 but
 but
 I'm
 I'm
 really


we
 had
 a
 we
 had
 a
 we
 had
 a
 very
 good


team
 at
 uh
 at
 MBIM,
 you
 know,
 which
 was


on
 the
 same
 who
 who
 were
 on
 the
 same


side
 of
 that.
 So,
 so
 really
 good
 talking


about
 trusting
 authority
 and
 so
 on.
 And


moving
 on
 to
 corporate
 culture
 at
 TCI.


What
 is
 a
 corporate
 culture
 like
 in
 TCI?


How
 many
 people
 are
 you?
 You
 know
 in
 the


investment
 team
 it
 it's
 it's it's
 you


know
 seven
 eight
 people.
 We
 have
 a
 large


back
 office
 but
 um
 how
 do
 you
 work


together?
 The
 we
 want
 small
 very
 small


and
 uh
 it's
 collegiate.
 Yeah.
 We've


known
 each
 other
 a
 long
 time
 and
 there's


something
 that
 we've
 built
 which
 is
 an


intangible
 trust.
 Why
 don't
 you
 have
 a


hundred
 fund
 managers?


Good
 question.
 Firstly,
 my
 best
 people,


you
 know,
 they
 would
 never
 stay.
 They


just
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 um
 it
 would
 be


too
 impersonal.
 There's
 a
 human
 aspect


to
 work.
 Yeah.


People
 don't
 come
 to


work,
 you
 know,
 the
 best
 people
 for


money.


they
 come
 to
 because
 they
 they
 enjoy
 the


environment.
 And
 so
 it's
 really


important
 how
 we
 treat
 people,
 how


everyone
 treats
 each
 other.


And
 I'll
 never
 hire
 someone
 without
 the


the
 the
 the
 blessing
 of
 my
 my
 my
 senior


team.
 Um
 and
 because
 we
 we
 could
 destroy


the
 the
 culture.
 And
 so
 I
 mean
 ice


hockey
 teams
 are
 five
 and
 football
 teams


are
 11.
 And
 is
 there
 something
 magic


with
 seven?
 No,
 but
 it's
 small
 enough.


Yeah,
 it
 would
 above
 10
 it
 would
 be
 too


too
 big.
 What
 do
 you
 look
 for
 when
 you


hire?
 So
 now
 I'm
 I'm
 applying
 for
 a
 job.


Everybody
 you
 meet
 everybody.


I'm
 applying
 for
 a
 job
 at
 TCI.
 I'm
 here.


You
 share
 the
 philosophy.
 You
 share
 the


philosophy.
 What
 kind
 of
 questions
 you


ask
 me?
 Yeah.
 What
 makes
 a
 good


business?
 All
 the
 things
 you
 talked


about
 it.
 It
 becomes
 Yeah.
 We
 we we
 ask


for
 a
 case
 study,
 right,
 or


two.
 And
 it
 becomes
 immediately
 obvious


whether
 you
 know
 what
 you're
 doing.


Yeah.
 Whether
 you
 share
 the
 philosophy,


but
 also
 it's
 not
 enough
 just
 to
 be
 a


good
 investor
 or
 you
 have
 to
 want
 to


work
 in
 a
 team.
 Yeah.
 Not
 everybody


wants
 that.
 And
 you
 have
 to
 be
 able
 to


get
 on
 with
 with
 people
 in
 in
 in
 a
 way


where
 you
 have
 to
 be
 open-minded
 to


being
 wrong.
 You
 can't
 be
 too
 dog


dogmatic
 because


um
 so
 the
 personality
 does
 matter
 a
 lot.


Now
 uh
 you
 have
 a
 big
 share
 of
 the


profit
 of
 the
 firm
 goes
 to
 the


charitable
 foundation
 right?
 Yes.
 How


well
 actually
 I
 I
 give
 it
 to
 charities.


A
 lot
 of
 philanthropy
 I
 do
 directly


often
 I
 give
 it
 to
 the
 foundation
 um
 uh


or
 co-invest
 with
 them.
 So
 yeah
 one
 way


or
 another
 it
 goes
 to
 charity.
 Do
 you


think
 it's
 important
 for
 your
 colleagues


that
 you
 guys
 fund
 all
 this
 well


charitable?
 No,
 I
 think
 they
 make
 a
 lot


of
 money
 too.
 Or
 do
 you
 think
 it's


irritating
 that
 you
 give
 away
 all
 the


money?
 They
 they
 they


they
 also
 earn
 uh
 you
 know
 good
 money


and
 uh
 it's
 probably
 a
 positive
 thing.
 I


I
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 definitively.
 I
 um


and


um
 the


um
 and
 um


the
 but
 I
 can't
 you'd
 have
 to
 ask
 them.


Uh
 I
 I
 can't
 say


definitively.
 Um
 but
 I
 um
 I
 I
 I


I
 yeah
 I
 I
 give
 away
 everything
 I
 earn.


I
 I
 don't
 really
 care
 about
 money
 for
 uh


because
 other
 than
 its
 value
 in
 helping


people.
 When
 did
 when
 did
 you
 learn


about
 philanthropy?
 Who
 taught
 you?
 When


I
 was
 in
 New
 York
 working
 for
 a
 hedge


fund
 uh
 one
 point
 after
 about
 three
 or


four


years
 it
 made
 I
 don't
 know
 two
 or
 three


million.
 and
 they
 I
 had
 done
 well
 and


they
 said,
 "You're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 $10


million
 bonus."
 And
 I
 just,
 this
 is
 in


intuition,
 said,
 "I
 don't
 want
 it.
 I
 I


want
 to
 just
 give
 it
 to
 charity."
 And
 I


created
 a
 a
 US
 foundation
 and
 gave
 it
 to


it.


Um,


and
 I
 didn't
 really
 understand


it
 what
 was
 driving


me
 for
 50
 years.


I
 would


uh
 meet
 with
 Bill
 Gates,
 did
 a
 lot
 of


charitable
 work
 with
 him
 over
 the
 years


and
 he
 would
 ask
 me
 and
 I
 I
 couldn't


answer
 the
 question
 and
 uh
 eventually
 I


did
 understand
 it
 and
 uh
 better
 late


than
 never
 as
 a
 as
 a
 soul
 urge
 that


there's


essence
 who
 we
 really
 are
 what
 we
 really


are
 isn't
 the
 personality
 or
 the


physical
 body
 but
 you
 know
 soul
 or


consciousness
 and
 and
 that
 um
 some
 would


call
 it
 life.
 Yep.
 That's
 something
 that


gives
 us
 life
 and


uh
 that


um
 and
 will.
 Yep.
 Gave
 you,
 you
 know,
 in


in
 the
 same
 way
 you
 uh
 Nikolai
 had
 a
 a


desire,
 a
 will,
 a
 will
 to
 do
 something


more
 with
 your
 life.
 Yeah.
 Than
 than


than than
 just
 make
 money.
 And
 uh
 and


that
 uh
 and
 that
 in
 the
 fundamental


nature
 of
 that
 uh
 that
 that
 uh


uh
 that's
 uh
 the
 soul
 is
 is
 service


desire
 to
 help
 to
 to to
 help
 ultimately


humanity
 and
 u
 where
 did
 that
 come
 from?


It's
 innate
 within
 everyone
 that
 but
 the


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 For
 sure.
 Everyone
 So
 if


it's
 inate
 with
 everyone
 why
 why
 don't


more
 people
 do
 it?
 Because
 they're


um
 they
 identify
 with
 their


personality
 a
 and
 less
 with
 the
 consider


that
 like
 a
 unit
 as
 a
 user
 interface
 of


the
 soul
 and
 uh
 and
 the
 personality's


basic


uh
 urge
 is


desire,


possessions,
 glamour
 like
 power
 and


money
 and
 other
 things
 like
 that.
 And
 um


and


uh
 sooner
 or
 later
 people


realize
 that
 that
 doesn't
 really
 um


give
 you
 know


um
 some
 would
 say
 happiness
 but
 actually


there's
 more
 important
 things
 in
 the


world
 in
 life
 than
 happiness.
 uh
 purpose


and
 meaning
 but
 not
 but
 you
 say
 that


sooner
 or
 later
 people
 but
 I
 mean
 people


don't
 I'm
 not
 saying
 in
 in
 in
 one
 life


they
 may
 need
 you
 know
 many
 lives
 and


that
 may
 be
 a
 strange
 thing
 for
 you
 to


hear
 to
 uh
 to
 realize
 yeah
 I
 don't


believe
 this
 is
 the
 only
 time
 we
 we
 we


we
 we're


um
 we
 here
 and
 um
 eventually
 we'll
 learn


that
 the
 the


um
 what
 we
 are
 and
 can


be
 as
 a
 result
 of
 some
 crisis
 in
 your


life.
 Yeah.
 And
 death,
 disease
 or
 or
 or


um
 or
 in
 my
 case
 the
 third
 D,


divorce.
 And
 uh
 the
 um
 and
 it's
 then


that
 they
 look
 inward
 and
 and and
 and


ask
 well
 what
 is
 their
 life
 about?
 What


is
 there
 a
 purpose?
 Is
 there
 a
 meaning?


And
 for


me,
 I
 could
 never
 find
 any
 purpose
 or


meaning
 in
 my
 life
 except


service.
 And
 uh
 and
 that
 is
 clearly
 uh


you
 know
 something
 you
 could
 say
 it


comes
 from
 within.
 Yep.
 And
 uh
 and
 so


that's
 my
 origins
 of
 my
 my
 philanthropy.


Do
 do
 you
 think
 uh
 I
 mean
 you
 came
 from


a
 working-class
 family,
 right?
 And
 your


father
 was
 an
 immigrant.
 Do
 you
 how
 do


you
 think
 that
 shaped
 you?
 It
 made
 me
 an


independent
 thinker.
 You
 always
 grew
 up


as
 an


outsider
 and
 um
 and
 uh
 you
 you
 felt


different
 and


um
 and


uh
 it
 gave
 me
 a
 work
 ethic,
 a
 work
 ethic


um
 and
 uh
 and


uh
 a
 desire
 to
 to
 achieve
 something.


Yeah.
 And
 uh
 so
 I
 think
 that
 that
 was
 an


important
 uh
 piece
 of
 my
 history.
 Yeah.


Tell
 me
 about
 the
 foundation.
 What
 are


the
 main
 priorities
 of
 the
 foundation?


Now
 first
 you
 said
 so
 it
 is
 now
 one
 of


the
 largest
 foundations
 in
 the
 world.


Right.
 We
 have
 uh
 about
 $6.5
 billion


dollars
 and
 uh
 in
 the
 foundation
 and


uh
 I
 also
 do
 philanthropy
 outside
 of


that
 and
 so
 between
 us
 we're
 giving
 away


over
 $500
 million
 a
 year.
 two
 main


areas,
 climate
 change
 and
 uh
 children's


health
 in
 Africa
 and
 India.
 On
 the
 um


health
 side,
 we
 focus


on
 foundational
 issues.
 Um


uh
 contraception
 is
 one.
 You
 know,
 we


can't
 get


development
 or
 lifting
 people
 out
 of


poverty
 if
 the
 the
 women
 are
 having


which
 far
 more
 children
 than
 they
 want.


you
 know
 in
 Africa
 fertility
 is
 nearly


seven
 and
 in
 many
 cases
 that's
 not


applicable
 they
 they
 they
 don't
 have


access


um
 a
 and
 agency
 women
 don't
 have
 access


or
 agency
 to
 to
 to
 contraception
 and
 so


for


$10
 cost


for
 a
 voided


uh
 a


pregnancy
 you
 can
 help
 a
 poor
 woman
 have


one
 less
 pregnancy
 if
 she
 wants.
 Yep.


And
 that's
 a
 remarkably
 low
 return
 on


invest
 high
 return
 on
 investment.
 Yeah.


There's
 almost
 nothing.
 Um
 another
 area


is
 um
 severe
 acute


malnutrition.
 Um
 where
 um
 I
 I
 I
 funded


the
 creation
 of
 a
 a
 company
 and
 I
 and
 I


buy
 product
 for
 um
 um
 for
 $40
 a
 case
 you


can
 of
 therapeutic
 food.
 Think
 of
 it
 as


a
 fortified
 uh
 uh
 power
 uh
 bar
 or
 it's


it's
 uh
 you
 can
 save
 a
 child's
 life
 and


there's
 100
 million
 children
 with
 severe


or
 acute
 malnutrition
 nearly
 half
 of
 all


child
 deaths
 under
 under
 five.
 Um


neglected
 tropical
 diseases
 like


traoma.
 I
 fund
 traoma
 surgeries
 where


just


a
 it's
 not
 for
 $50
 you
 can
 um
 do
 fund
 a


surgery
 which
 stops
 someone
 going
 blind


irreversibly.
 Yeah.
 And
 there's
 you
 know


millions
 of
 people
 with
 with
 this.
 So


with
 so
 little
 money
 Yeah.
 $10,
 $40,


$50,
 you
 you
 can
 save
 a
 life.
 Yeah.
 Or


or or
 or
 stop
 something
 going
 blind.
 It


it
 it's


remarkably
 you
 know
 you


know
 what
 what
 you
 know
 when
 you
 go
 to


go
 out
 for
 dinner
 you
 might
 pay
 $40
 for


a
 bottle
 of
 wine
 you
 wouldn't
 think
 oh
 I


could
 save
 someone's
 life
 with
 this
 but


that's
 the
 reality
 and
 so


um
 the
 um
 um
 HIV
 AIDS
 um
 we're
 very


involved
 in
 as
 Well,
 uh
 so
 um
 uh
 and
 on


the
 climate
 side,
 what
 are
 the
 main


areas
 that
 we've
 been
 trying
 to
 create


infrastructure
 for
 the
 climate
 movement


um
 and
 uh
 uh
 reg
 regulation
 advocacy


because
 nothing's
 going
 to
 be
 fixed
 if


there
 isn't
 regulation.


um
 we
 fund
 um
 uh
 then
 that's
 across
 the


board
 and
 that's
 and
 also
 technical


assistance
 to
 governments
 who
 want
 to


change
 but
 don't
 know
 how
 we're
 very


active
 in
 Asia
 where
 where
 if
 you
 don't


operate
 in
 in
 in
 India
 and
 China
 you


that's
 where
 and
 and and
 and
 you
 know


Vietnam
 and
 all
 these
 countries
 that's


where
 all
 the
 emissions
 are
 growing
 tax


is
 another
 thing
 because
 if
 if
 we're
 not


advantaging
 through
 tax
 uh
 new


technologies
 and
 and
 and
 we're


subsidizing
 fossil
 fuels,
 which
 is
 what


happens.
 We'll
 never
 change.
 Um
 um
 a
 and


uh
 methane
 is
 another
 one.
 We're
 a
 fun


of
 the
 methane
 hub
 and
 methane


satellites
 and
 just
 many
 things
 uh


litigation,
 environmental
 litigation.
 We


fund
 that.
 So,
 in
 a
 sense,
 there's


activism
 there.
 And
 um
 so
 given
 all


this,
 how
 do
 you
 read
 the
 backlash


against
 ESG
 in
 financial
 markets?
 Well,


I
 never
 really
 got
 involved
 in
 in
 in
 in


the
 S
 and
 the
 G.
 I
 just
 the
 E.
 And
 so


here
 I
 I
 I
 I
 think
 is
 a
 very
 dark


uh
 um
 thing
 that's
 going
 on
 where
 people


are
 saying
 some
 people
 are
 saying
 in
 in


effect
 burn
 down
 the
 planet
 as
 long
 as


we
 can
 make
 money
 today
 and
 uh
 we
 don't


care
 about
 future
 generations.
 We
 don't


care
 about
 poor
 people
 in
 poor
 countries


dying
 off.
 We
 only
 care
 about
 our


country.
 Yep.
 And
 and
 making
 money
 as


much
 money
 as
 we
 can
 today
 to
 hell
 with


the


consequences.


And
 it's
 really
 back
 to
 what
 I
 was


talking
 about
 this
 distinction
 between


soul
 and
 personality
 that
 if
 um
 it's
 a


consciousness
 problem
 and
 uh
 and


actually
 we'll
 never
 solve
 any
 of
 these


problems
 whether
 it's
 climate
 or
 poverty


or
 war
 if
 there
 isn't
 a
 change
 in
 the


level
 of
 consciousness.


So
 given
 that
 and
 in
 order
 to
 finish
 off


on
 a
 slightly
 more
 uplifting
 note
 um


What
 is
 your
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to


young
 people
 on
 a
 kind


of
 spiritual
 Yeah.
 Go
 on
 a
 spiritual
 um


path.
 Go
 on


a
 study
 a


and
 I
 would
 say
 the
 spiritual
 world
 is


real.


soul
 is
 uh
 when
 I
 first
 mentioned
 this


to
 my
 son
 I
 think
 he
 was
 uh
 20
 he
 said


dad
 the
 soul
 is
 a


myth
 he
 doesn't
 think
 that
 now
 is
 it
 not


he
 doesn't
 think
 that
 now
 it's


definitely
 not
 and
 there
 are
 many
 paths


to
 connect
 to
 it
 and
 uh
 you
 can
 connect


consciously
 to
 it
 and
 um
 and


uh
 whether
 you
 go
 the
 long
 way
 the
 short


way
 the
 easy
 way
 the
 the
 hard
 way


through
 suffering
 you
 eventually
 come
 to


to
 to
 learn
 that
 it
 the
 spiritual
 world


is
 not
 just
 real
 but
 it's
 the
 the
 whole


thing


and
 and
 so
 the


um
 and
 that's
 the
 only
 source
 of
 real


purpose
 and
 meaning
 and
 and
 and
 and


joy
 which
 the
 world
 needs.
 Yep.
 And
 and


and
 I
 think
 that


uh
 um
 if
 you
 crack
 that
 then
 everything


else
 is
 easy.
 Very
 good.
 Uh
 Chris
 Horn,


we've
 talked
 a
 lot
 about
 purpose,


meaning
 joy
 and
 what
 really
 matters
 in


life.
 A
 big
 thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.
 And


Nick,
 thank
 you.
