Hello everyone, I'm Anthony
Welcome to my channel
In the previous video
We use Japanese anime
Analysis of the classic character Battle Girl
pointed out
The hollowness and unreality of the fighting girl's personality
This makes it suitable as an object for the audience's sexual projection
That's at the end of the video
We also mentioned
Battle Girls and ACGN culture itself
Not a problem
The key lies in the attitude of the parties towards this role
So today's video
Let's discuss this further.
The aesthetic of white, thin and young in East Asian society
And the cute culture behind it
Before the video starts, let me say
I will post this video
Put it in the list of "Psychology and Education"
If you have anything you want to discuss with me
and consultation topics
You can contact my email to make an appointment
So let's get back to today's topic
On the surface
We say the so-called "white, thin and young" aesthetic
Refers to a fairly standardized set of physical characteristics:
Fair skin symbolizes purity and unpolluted
A thin figure means being slender and non-aggressive
Arouse people's desire to protect
The youthful appearance and body
It directly implies a naive and submissive
Immature state of mind and body
But appearances aren't what really matter.
But the spirit
Appearance is just an externalization of the spirit
What we appreciate
It is never the isolated physical characteristics of another person
Rather, these characteristics serve as signs and symbols
The spiritual meaning behind it
These meanings
Usually influenced by social culture
The results of repeated coding of personal experiences
Therefore, we think a person's appearance is beautiful.
In fact, it is unconsciously changing the appearance of this person
As a shell of her inner feelings
Appearance is a Signifier
That is, visible symbols
The inner emotions and qualities it represents
It is "Signified"
That is the meaning of the symbol
The reason why “white, thin and young” can become a powerful aesthetic paradigm
It's not some instinct engraved in genes
It is shaped by the entire culture for hundreds and thousands of years.
and in recent decades
The repetitive coding of the exploding cultural industry
are inseparable
That is, in the signifier "white, thin and young"
and the referent "pure, innocent, simple"
Established a fairly solid associative pathway
So we say
What does the white, thin and young aesthetic really mean?
It is an obsession with spiritual immaturity and weakness.
A typical case
It is the Japanese idol group AKB48
Their success
It is largely based on
On the creation and sale of this "mental childishness"
In times of economic downturn
People's consumption concepts are also becoming more conservative.
The positioning of AKB48
It's an idol you can meet.
Like the girl next door
A coming-of-age narrative
Their cuteness and intimacy
Became the spiritual salvation of otaku
This positioning itself
Bringing idols and fans closer together
Weakened the beauty of traditional stars
But the halo is out of reach
With a "cute" and accessible feeling of intimacy
Fans witnessed
A group of ordinary girls whose appearance and talents are not top-notch
How to achieve success through your own “hard work”, “sweat” and “clumsiness”
Step by step to the center of the stage
Fans' consumption
It is precisely their imperfection and unfinished state
In order to maintain this sense of "unfinished" purity
They also have strict rules prohibiting dating
For example, in 2013, a member
Because he was found to be in a relationship with another artist
He had to shave his head to apologize
This rule is essentially an institutionalized
Artificially prolonging their mental immaturity
Make sure they are in front of the fans
Always the one who fights for his dream,
An innocent girl who is emotionally "loyal" to her fans
Rather than one
Mature women with complex personal emotional lives
Their behavior, speech, and stage performance
They are constantly strengthening this naive effort
Even a bit of a reckless "personality"
This allows us to see more clearly
The essence of “white, thin and young”:
It is not just the physical characteristics that it is obsessed with
It's an immature mind.
An object that is mentally passive and dependent
Let's review
Interesting comments about Steel Roll Girl
For example, someone commented that if she gets shy
How about a slap in the face?
This fantasy is not
Experience the danger of being attacked by a superpowered being
Rather, this interaction reflects
Her coquettishness and shyness
Another comment said
I wouldn't say a word if a girl like this asked for 3 million yuan in betrothal gifts
This is to regard the other party as
An item waiting to be appraised or adopted
Possessing superpowers does not change their spiritual simplicity, passivity and naivety.
On the other hand
If a person is only white, thin and young in appearance
But she is a very complex and strong woman.
It's not so easy to project this kind of cuteness.
A counterexample
that is
Hero units of the Japanese faction in the game Red Alert 3
Yuriko
EA caters to the aesthetics of East Asian players
Created a double ponytail like this
A superpowered beautiful girl wearing a Japanese short skirt school uniform
But they just copied
The appearance of a Japanese fighting girl
But for this role
Designed an extremely tragic and traumatic history
In the game
Yuriko was isolated since childhood
Later discovered by the Japanese government
and conduct cruel human experiments
It was eventually shaped into the empire's ultimate weapon.
So she had a huge hatred for the experimenter
Her eyes were full of aggression and weird emotions
This makes the character very three-dimensional.
But it's also very heavy
Even scary
It is difficult to project cute emotions
As we said in the previous video
The charm of Japanese fighting girls
It is precisely because they are deliberately stripped of their trauma
They don't have a complicated spiritual growth history.
Their hearts are empty
Their self-awareness is also not awakened
so
Only then can fans project their cute emotions onto it
And the fighting girls of East Asia
Even if given some kind of trauma
This trauma
It usually does not constitute the driving force of their personality development
But it is aestheticized and poeticized
It is a way to evoke the players' love
and tools for compassionate feelings
Just an embellishment
Lack of soul depth
So where do their super powers come from?
This can only be attributed to the gift of mysterious props
Or fate's arrangement
The reason can be very simple
There's not even logic
Because it's not important
What they want to protect or restore
It is also the kind of idyllic and harmonious collective
In the United States
Or in the eyes of Western creators
An extremely powerful
But there is no history, no pain, no struggling characters
It's flat and unreal
Superpowers themselves are an abnormal state
And one in the collective
People in an undifferentiated state of self-awareness
His heart is still.
thus
He also lacks the desire and impulse to break the routine
The desire for superpowers or power
Often comes from compensation for trauma
Because I was so weak and lonely
So I have to become strong
Behind this desire
There is always some kind of pain, struggle, etc. of human emotions
Therefore, the character of Yuriko
This just reflects that American creators are not good at
Or maybe I don't understand this kind of white, thin and young aesthetic
They seem to be trying to cater to this aesthetic.
But still for this role
Installed a powerful
Subjectivity and the Resentful Soul
Although it makes this character more real and layered
But from the perspective of product design
This is exactly contrary to the cute culture of East Asia.
So here we go
I want to emphasize that
Appreciate things that are childish, immature, clumsy, and cute
This is not a problem in itself
For example, we see cute kittens and puppies
I just want to get close and touch
For example, when two people are in an intimate communication
Relax each other's personal boundaries
They begin to behave in a childish manner.
Giving each other cute nicknames and acting cute
These are all very beautiful and interesting emotions.
It can even be said
If these things are not present in a relationship
That means
The relationship is not intimate, deep, or relaxing enough
Healthy regression allows us to feel held
Feeling deeply connected and healed
and then
It can also stimulate vitality and creativity of life
However
What we are going to focus on and discuss here
The motivation behind appreciating childishness and cuteness
If a person can only
Or it is mainly due to the other party's immaturity,
A beautiful feeling in cuteness and innocence
But cannot or
Rarely can we appreciate and admire another person's strength and maturity
Mysterious and independent side
So this appreciation of cuteness
It may become
The client's tool for escape and defense growth
We say
Anyone
No matter how mature and independent their thoughts and personalities are
In her character
There must be a childish, innocent side.
Human growth and development never follow a linear order
It is not a complete severance of the previous stage of self
Enter the next stage without any residue
But
Based on the negation and integration of the previous stage
It contains the wisdom of the previous stage.
Entering the next stage
It's also spiraling upward
In this sense
one person
Of course, it can always be in a corner of my heart
Keep yourself simple and innocent
Nostalgic and sad emotions
However
When individuals fail to develop
Aesthetic preference for being strong and independent
When a person's emotions are fixed on clumsy, pitiful,
Cute objects on
This may reflect
He encountered some difficulties in his growth
In fact, any culture
can be unilaterally developed into a tool of escape and defense
Some young people
Accustomed to being immersed in cute culture
They like baby things
Also like to play the role of a child
In Chinese society
Some middle-aged and elderly people
Maybe I'm more accustomed to another way of escape
That is through the so-called big picture
The emperor's perspective is integrated
By pretending to be in harmony with the historical process
Merge with state power
Isolating and avoiding one's true emotions
Playing a so-called profound and mature
therefore
We are not criticizing the aesthetics of white, thin and young
But I want to analyze it
To touch and connect that deep heart
Seeking stability and control
But an interesting question arises
If you love simplicity and innocence
It is a universal human psychology
Why East Asia?
Or in Japan
This aesthetic preference
Can develop into such a unique and systematic
What about the cultural industry that is even sweeping the world?
Japan in this regard
What kind of historical heritage and soil has been accumulated?
How can such a unique and cute culture be nurtured?
To answer this question
We need to look at it from the perspective of language
Tracing the genes of this culture
As
Scholar Shihoda Inuhiko's research in his book "On Cuteness"
Cute, cute words
It has undergone a complex evolution in history
It can be traced back to Kahayushi or Kahohayushi
The latter describes things that appear more colorful.
It also means that the complexion looks better.
Blushing due to excitement, shyness, or embarrassment
This already implies what we call cute today.
Cute connotation
In the early eleventh century
Sei Shonagon in his essay The Pillow Book
With a very delicate and sensitive perspective
Describes the innocent play of children
A little sparrow jumping over the child's face
A three-year-old child saw a small object on the ground.
Use its small fingers to pick it up and show it to adults
Girl pushes her hair away from her eyes
When we feel this picture
indeed
You can feel a very Japanese aesthetic
Here all these things are called cute
All are young, fragile,
Innocence and the need to be cared for
However, it has already been recorded in the literature
It is the 12th-century Konjaku Monogatarishu
The meaning of this word in the sentence is terrible.
Poor, worthy of sympathy
This is contrary to what many of us think
People today feel
The word "cute" means "pleasing" or "pretty"
But its genes contain pity, intolerance,
Meaning of sympathy
This seems like a big contrast.
But when we use the word cute
When you carefully consider and savor
In fact, it is natural to feel a touch of sadness.
Cute culture appreciates those who are slender, fragile,
Short-lived objects
Such as cherry blossoms, fallen leaves, kittens, clumsy children
Its logic is this:
The subject first feels the beauty of the objective object
Then think of the fragility and consciousness of this object
Then feel pity, sympathy and sadness
And then because of this sadness
And produce a subtle sense of beauty of pity
The cycle continues
This sense of beauty has also been deepened
this
This is the commonality between cute aesthetics and mono no aware aesthetics
Such a perspective
In Japanese culture
With a long and profound heritage
As the author concludes
Cute aesthetics is about small, fragile
Emotions arise from things that need protection from others
Gradually from others to oneself
Emerging Beauty
When we compare the culture of other nations
You can feel it more
What's special about Japanese cute culture
The uniqueness of a word
This is best reflected in translation
When you find a word
It is difficult to find a perfect equivalent in another language
This means that it carries the unique connotation of this culture.
For example, かわいい is often translated into cute in English.
But the genes of English word cute are different from those of かわいい.
We said
The word cute actually has the following etymologies: pitiful,
Meaning of intolerance, sympathy, and shyness
The etymology of Cute
Can be traced back to the Latin Acutus
This word means sharp, pointed,
Intelligent, clever, shrewd
Cute did not appear until the 18th century.
Its original meaning is clever and clever
After the 19th century
It is used to describe the cuteness of children and small animals.
In contrast
日语的かわいい是没有聪明，
Smart, intelligent
Describe an adult woman in English as cute
Often with a small, light, friendly, beautiful
But it's not threatening
And beautiful or elegant
It is a more advanced and solemn compliment
In French
Can't even find a word for cute
As the author concludes
In Japan, if you praise a woman as beautiful
The other person may feel shy and overwhelmed
They may also think you are joking or not sincere enough.
But if you praise her for being cute
He will probably accept it happily.
And think it comes from the heart
Pleasant compliments
The difference in this social scene
Revealed an important fact
In the context of contemporary Japan
Cuteness often surpasses beauty.
It is no longer a second-rate,
Adjectives that apply only to children
Instead, it has become a more popular and intimate
Even the highest form of praise
This kind of putting "cute" above "beautiful"
Or at least a value ranking that is on par with it
It also enables us to understand
“White, thin and young” aesthetic
Why can it reach such an extreme form in Japan?
So here we go
Some friends may ask
We should resist and deny this cute culture
Or is it the aesthetic of white, thin and young?
I think the answer is neither hugs nor
Not resistance
But "integration"
As we said before
A truly mature self
It is precisely that which can integrate all its parts
No part of her self was abandoned
can be fully developed and recognized
This of course also includes the inner, innocent
The "child" self that longs to be held
The real problem
Maybe it's not that we like or resist cuteness
It's whether we still have
The ability to love the "unlovable"
Do we still have the courage to embrace a real
Imperfect
Others full of unknowns and challenges
Can you appreciate it?
The kind of tempered by pain and struggle
Mature beauty with a rough texture
We will continue to delve deeper into this topic in the next video
