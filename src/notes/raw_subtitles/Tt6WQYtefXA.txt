- [Derek] This is a video
about how Japanese swords are made,
swords that are strong
enough and sharp enough
to slice a bullet in half.
The access we got for
this video is incredible.
We were able to film everything
from gathering the iron sand
to smelting the iron, forging the sword,
to sharpening and polishing it.
They even let us use it.
- [Petr] That is so cool!
- [Derek] The method
of making these swords
has remained virtually
unchanged for hundreds of years,
with everything done by hand.
They are still considered to
be among the best in the world.
- The Japanese made a weapon
that was the absolute pinnacle
for their style of warfare
and the materials they had at hand.
- These swords are held
in such high regard
that one from the 16th century
has been appraised at $105 million,
making it the most
expensive sword ever built.
(sword thwacks)
(dramatic music)
(river noises)
In the Shimane province of Japan
there is a smelter that is lit
for only one night each year
where steel is made in the
same way it was 1300 years ago.
It's known as the Tatara method,
and only steel made in this way ends up
in the very best Japanese swords.
And we were invited to come film it.
(drums and flute music)
Just after 9:00 AM, the
ceremonial prayers are said
and the fire is lit by a Shinto priest.
Everyone that will be working
this smelter will be here
for at least the next 24 hours.
That includes Veritasium producer Petr.
- I'm committed. We're gonna do this.
It's gonna be fun.
- [Derek] Sword making in Japan
goes back about 3000 years,
but in those days, swords
were made out of bronze.
We're not sure how people
first learned to smelt metal,
but it was likely related to pottery.
- In that you were using these rocky oars
to make glazes and such for pottery
under very controlled atmospheres.
And then find maybe the
potters found metallic beads
in the bottom of the furnaces
that they were firing it.
This possibly gave them the idea.
- [Derek] Bronze was
discovered before steel
because it's an alloy of
copper, and usually tin,
both metals with low enough melting points
that they can be smelted
in regular pottery kilns.
The problem with bronze
is that although it can be sharpened,
it's too soft to hold an edge for long.
So Japanese sword makers
shifted to steel 1200 years ago
in the Heian period.
This is what most people would recognize
as a Japanese sword.
It's made of steel with a curved blade.
Steel is an alloy of iron,
the fourth-most-common
element in Earth's crust.
The oceans of the world used
to be rich with dissolved iron.
But two and a half billion years ago,
cyanobacteria started
photosynthesizing and creating oxygen.
The iron reacted with that oxygen
precipitating out of solution
to be deposited at the
bottom of the ocean.
Incidentally, the cyanobacteria
were poisoned by the oxygen
that they themselves produced
so it's thought that when
levels got high enough,
they died off, and as a
result, oxygen levels dropped
and iron no longer
precipitated out of solution.
Then the cyanobacteria
could multiply again
and the cycle repeated.
That's why most of the world's
iron is found in layers
of sedimentary rock called
banded iron formations.
Each layer of iron was formed
during a global flourishing
of cyanobacteria
that infused the ocean with oxygen.
The majority of the global iron supply
comes from these banded iron formations
because of their high
concentration of iron,
up to around 60% iron oxide by weight.
(gentle music)
But Japan, with its
mostly volcanic geology,
has barely any of these
sedimentary iron oxides.
And this is likely why
the country was late
to the steel production game.
Archeologists have found
steel artifacts in Anatolia,
which is modern day Turkey,
that are nearly 4,000 years old.
But in Japan, metals including steel,
were imported from China and Korea
up until the eighth century
when Japan started making its own steel.
So where did they get the raw ingredients?
Well, igneous rocks
like granite and diorite
still contain iron oxides,
just in much lower concentrations.
But as the mountains are weathered,
these iron oxides are broken
apart and washed downstream.
Eventually they become part of the sand.
The Japanese noticed
that because iron oxides
are denser than other
minerals in the sand,
they accumulate in places
where the river changes
direction or speed.
The heavier iron sinks to the bottom
and the lighter material is washed away.
To amplify this effect,
they deliberately created
diversions in the river
to increase the concentration of iron.
- What do you do is you
dam off a section of river
and then you drag sand into it.
Because iron is heavier than
the other parts of the sand,
it is the thing that gets left behind
and everything else
gets washed downstream.
- [Derek] With this method,
you can get iron sands
with 80% iron oxides by weight.
That's more concentrated
than high-quality iron ore.
And since it has fewer impurities,
it's an excellent source
for high-quality steel.
If you heat up those iron oxides
to over 1,250 degrees Celsius,
you can break the bonds with
oxygen and get pure iron.
But pure iron is actually
softer than bronze.
So in its elemental state,
iron provides no advantage.
But nature gave humans a lucky break.
One of the few ways you
can heat something up
to 1,250 degrees is with charcoal,
and charcoal is basically pure carbon,
and if you add just a little
bit of carbon to iron,
it creates an incredibly
strong alloy: steel.
- Yeah, a lot of people
see it as a heat process.
I see it as a chemical process.
- [Derek] Alloys are usually
stronger than pure metals
because they contain
different sized atoms,
and this reduces the ability of atoms
to slide past each other when
an external force is applied.
- So I've just been given gloves,
other gloves, and a towel.
So things are very much getting real.
I'm genuinely quite worried.
(serious music)
Here is the room with all of the charcoal
that we're going to be using overnight.
There's just bags and bags of this stuff.
(charcoal rattles)
(flame crackles)
There's a Buddhist saying:
"Before enlightenment,
chop wood, carry water.
After enlightenment,
chop wood, carry water."
So we're lining up on the
four corners, I guess.
(charcoal rattles)
Oh. Oh boy.
Didn't do a great job of that. (chuckles)
(thunder rumbles)
So the rain is coming,
so we're quickly getting
all of the charcoal out
and then measuring it.
So each bag of these is 10 kilos. Okay.
(serious music)
So with the iron sand, it
is mixed together with water
because if you don't mix it with water
and you put it on the flame,
it just flies straight up.
But if you mix it with too much water,
then there is water that's gonna heat up.
It's gonna become water vapor,
and the whole kiln could explode.
Terrifyingly enough, they do this by feel.
They mix in enough water
until the iron sand is clumpy.
But again, if it's too much,
the whole thing could explode.
Okay, put some iron in.
It is just past four in the afternoon,
and over the last couple of hours
we have added 250 kilograms of charcoal
and nearly 60 kilograms of iron sand.
So yeah, it's a slow process,
but I think we're
starting to get somewhere.
I have no idea because
obviously the thing is hidden,
but it should be growing.
- [Derek] To achieve the high temperatures
required to make steel,
you need a strong,
steady supply of oxygen.
For hundreds of years,
this was provided by huge
foot-operated bellows.
It would've taken an
around-the-clock, full-body effort
by many men to maintain
the furnace's temperature.
- When I came here,
I was a little bit sad that
the bellows were electric.
I really wanted to, you know,
have this proper experience,
have this proper workout
of stepping on these bellows for 24 hours.
(serious music)
- [Derek] The temperature
inside the smelter
gets up to 1500 degrees Celsius,
just below the melting point
of iron, which is 1538 Celsius.
So the iron being smelted isn't liquid,
but it's soft and malleable enough
to clump together into
a big block of iron.
No matter how high
quality the iron sand is,
there will always be some impurities,
like sulfur, phosphorus,
and silicon oxides.
They combine with carbon from the charcoal
and melt at a lower temperature than iron,
so they become liquid
and flow to the bottom.
This is known as slag.
After many more hours of
adding charcoal and iron sand,
it is time for the first
removal of the slag.
Before the first removal of
slag, another prayer is said.
(steelworkers clap)
- Oh, that's insane.
(slag sizzles)
(serious music)
(hammer pinging)
Whoa.
So for the last three hours,
there's been three processes
that we've been doing.
One is adding the charcoal,
two is adding the iron sand,
and three is opening up
the smelter from the bottom
to break apart the impurities
so they can flow out.
(shovels scrape)
Just want you guys to know
that it's 3:16 in the morning
and I'm still here and I'm really sleepy.
(subdued music)
So it's currently six o'clock
in the morning the next day.
We've been smelting for 21 hours.
I'm exhausted, but the
sun is about to come out
and it's been pretty
amazing, I gotta be honest.
We gotta close these doors really quick
before they get mad at me.
- [Derek] At 9:00 AM the next morning,
the smelting is complete.
A total of 614 kilograms of iron sand
and 670 kilograms of charcoal
were added to the smelter.
At this point, in a traditional smelter,
the only way to get the steel out
would be to break it apart.
These days, a crane is used
to take the smelter apart.
- [Petr] Oh wow, okay.
Oh!
- [Derek] And what is left to
show for all that hard work
is a 100 kilogram block
of steel, iron, and slag.
Only around a third of this
block is high enough quality
to be used in sword making.
(crane whirs and clunks)
- Oh, that's insane. That's so cool.
The result for all the hard work.
This is step one of
making a Japanese sword.
(subdued music)
- [Derek] The steel is sorted
by quality and carbon content,
which is also done by eye,
in fact, this is one of
the exams you need to pass
to be certified as a swordsmith.
Then, the different grades
of steel are sent out
to one of 300 swordsmiths
around the country.
Only 30 do it as their full-time job,
and one of them is Akihara Kokaji,
who we went to visit next.
This is when the forging
of the sword begins.
In a coal oven with hand-pumped bellows,
the steel is heated until
it is soft and malleable.
Then using hammers,
the master swordsmith
flattens out the steel.
In the old days, this would've
been done by the swordsmith
and three apprentices.
The swordsmith using a smaller
hammer, would set the rhythm
and the apprentices would use big mallets
to flatten the steel.
(hammers clank)
(Petr grunts)
- Woo. That was terrifying.
- [Derek] These days,
electric hammers are used.
When the steel is flat enough,
it is then bent back on itself,
(fire crackles)
and it is then hammered again
to press the steel back
together into a solid block.
(gentle music)
So why go to all this
effort flattening the steel,
only to fold it back on itself
and end up with a chunk of
steel the same size as before?
Well, because folding does
two very important things.
First, it spreads out the impurities
like silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus.
It spreads them out throughout the steel.
This ensures a uniform consistency
without any weak points.
Second, it gives the steel a grain.
After folding the sword,
it is now reinforced
in the direction that it
will be hit in combat,
and as a bonus, the steel
is exposed to the air.
So there is a small amount
of oxidation creating
a darker colored steel,
which when folded makes
beautiful patterns.
There are some swords which
have more than a billion layers.
Now this doesn't mean the sword
has been folded a billion times
since every fold doubles
the number of layers,
so you only need about 30
folds to get a billion layers.
But usually a sword is
folded 10 to 13 times,
resulting in a few
thousand layers of steel.
Now a blade isn't made from
a single block of steel.
The carbon content affects
how hard the steel is.
So different carbon percentages
are used in different parts of the blade.
Because carbon atoms are
much smaller than iron atoms,
they can fit inside the
crystal lattice of iron.
These trapped carbon atoms
then apply an outward force to the lattice
putting the steel under stress.
The higher the carbon percentage,
the harder and more rigid the steel.
But this hardness comes at a cost.
The steel becomes brittle,
making it more likely to chip
and shatter rather than bend.
So what swordsmiths do
is they use steel with
different carbon contents
for different parts of the blade.
The edge is always high carbon steel
to make it hard and rigid
so it can maintain a sharp
edge for a long time.
But the spine is usually
made of lower-carbon steel,
which allows the sword
to flex without breaking.
This is done by welding
together pieces of steel
with different carbon contents.
- So we have about a 15-minute break
because you know it takes
a while for the iron
to heat up and then meld together,
and then we're back in there.
It's very hot. It's
very, very hot in there.
It's kind of unbelievable
that he can do this for
four hours at a time.
- [Derek] After the sword
is hammered into shape,
which is a straight blade, it
is covered in a layer of clay,
a thick layer for the spine,
and a thin layer for the blade itself.
It's then heated in the furnace
and then rapidly cooled in water,
a process known as quenching.
Now, because the layers of clay
have different thicknesses,
the rate of cooling is faster
for the edge than the spine.
When the steel is heated,
carbon enters the iron lattice,
and since the spine of the
sword is covered in thick clay,
it will cool slowly,
giving time for the carbon
atoms to leave the iron matrix.
This will lead to a very
low-carbon steel called ferrite,
but the carbon atoms
which have left the matrix
will be caught by other iron atoms
and created a type of
steel known as cementite.
The combination of ferrite and cementite
is known as perlite,
and it's a mostly soft
and ductile form of steel,
though parts of it are
hard due to the cementite.
So per light forms the spine of the sword.
In contrast, the very thin
layer of clay on the blade
means that it cools very rapidly,
so more of the carbon is
trapped in the lattice.
This forces the lattice structure
to change from cubic to tetragonal
making a form of steel
known as martensite.
Since the trapped carbon
puts stress on the lattice,
martensite is incredibly hard,
exactly what you'd want
for the edge of a sword.
The tetragonal lattice
structure of martensite
also takes up more space
so the edge of the blade
expands relative to the spine,
curving the sword backwards.
The iconic curve of a samurai sword
comes from the formation of martensite.
You can actually see the boundary
between different types of
steel in a finished sword
by the difference in color.
This is known as hamon, which
literally means edge pattern.
- At the Victoria Albert Museum in London,
there is a Japanese sword
that has a very detailed
little dragon in the hamon,
and I've looked at it many times.
I don't, okay, I don't know
how he did that. (laughs)
- [Derek] About one third of all blades
shatter during the quenching process.
- You quench it once
and you thank the stars that you made it.
- [Derek] The sword is then
placed back in the forage
to evaporate any remaining water.
This also provides a little bit of energy
to loosen some of the crystal structures
making the sword less brittle.
- And that's about the extent
of the tempering process
on a Japanese sword,
which that that might be
enough to relax things a bit,
but they kept the edge much harder
than you would've in the West.
- [Derek] After the sword is forged,
it is sent to a polisher.
The polishing and sharpening of a sword
is also done by hand
with whetstones of different coarsenesses.
It can take a month to sharpen
and polish a single sword.
- One of the things that
I love is that like,
this table is sloping down
and the entire floor over
there is sloping down.
So when you like add the water,
all of the residue and all the water,
you know, flows downhill
so it's not perfectly flat.
(hammer taps softly)
- [Derek] Sometimes the swords
are also engraved with beautiful patterns,
though this is quite rare.
And after all that, the sword is done.
To learn how to use a Japanese sword,
Petr got a lesson from a
master, Takara Takanashi.
He is the 10th-generation student
of Miyamoto Musashi, a legendary samurai.
Musashi killed his first
opponent in single combat
at the age of 13.
He spent the rest of his life
perfecting his sword-fighting,
inventing a new technique with two swords.
Musashi fought in more
than 60 duels to the death,
and he won every last one of them.
(serious music)
(subdued music)
There is a story about a duel
that took place during a snowstorm.
As he faced his opponent,
katana outstretched,
Musashi was so calm and
kept his sword so still
that snowflakes began to accumulate
on the thin edge of the blade.
- [Petr] So during the lesson,
I thought I would get to use a katana,
but instead we spent the entire time
learning how to take the
blade out of its sheath
and then put it back in.
So when I actually got
the chance to use a katana
to slice through some things,
I was deeply unprepared.
(katana thuds)
(playful music)
- [Producer] Well, it
looks like it's your turn.
I'm so scared.
Okay, so this has been an amazing day.
We've looked at some beautiful katanas,
and now these wonderful
people are letting me use one
of their just unbelievably
beautiful pieces of art
to chop some things.
(Petr exhales forcefully)
(katana thuds)
- Oh.
Oh.
- Woo!
Like this is kind of the best day ever.
(subdued music)
- [Derek] There really
is something remarkable
about Japanese swords.
The amount of care,
attention, and expertise
that each step requires,
from the gathering and
refining of the iron sand
to the smelting,
to the forging and sharpening a sword,
each step takes so much time and skill.
It's incredible that all
these things were discovered
by trial and error to produce
artifacts of such high quality
that they are still
prized centuries later.
(steelworkers speaking Japanese)
(steelworkers clap)
- [Derek] Before I made this video,
I didn't really appreciate
that swords can be art.
To me, it's a good reminder
that whatever you do,
you should do it with deep
care, attention to detail,
and love for the craft.
(both speaking Japanese)
- Do that enough times
and you might just make
something beautiful.
(audio chimes and warbles)
Hey, this part of the video
was brought to you by Henson Shaving.
You know, making high
quality things is hard,
and as far as I'm concerned,
Henson make the highest-quality
razors in the world,
the katanas of the shaving
world, if you will.
I've been using their AL-13
razor for the last year,
and it's the best razor
I've used by a long margin.
One of the reasons for that
is Henson really understands
the physics of shaving,
because as aerospace
machinists for 20 years,
they understand how to
cut things effectively.
They get precision.
Human hair is much harder than
the skin it's growing out of,
and as a result, typical razors drag
and pull on the hair while cutting.
What a multi-blade
razor does is it assumes
that the first cut will be ineffective,
and so they build in extra
blades to cut the hair
before it can snap back into position.
And that does result in a good cut,
but it also increases friction
leading to razor burn and skin irritation.
Henson carefully studied that problem
and realized that you didn't
need to add extra blades,
you just needed to properly
support a single blade.
Virtually every razor on allows
for too much play in the
blade, but Henson doesn't.
The result is an effective cut
without the additional
friction on your skin.
Seriously, a Henson is
truly a great razor.
It'll last you a lifetime.
You will get a better
shave with less irritation,
and you'll also save
money in the long run.
