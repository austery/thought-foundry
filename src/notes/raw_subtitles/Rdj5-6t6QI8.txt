- Let's torch it!
Previously on Veritasium, we
learned how Hans Goldschmidt
discovered that metal oxide-like rust
can react with aluminum powder
to produce pure liquid metal.
Oh!
Reactions of this type are
known as thermite reactions.
(dramatic music)
Whoa! (laughs)
Whoa! Yeah!
(explosions popping)
That is crazy!
Wow.
(dramatic music continues)
Initially, thermite found
limited applications,
repairing heavy machinery
in remote locations.
It's much more common use,
The one where it's widely employed today,
took a bit more convincing.
There is one sound that everyone
associates with railroads.
(soft banjo music)
(train wheels clacking)
This is the sound of
train wheels passing over
the join between one rail and the next.
In the early days of railroads,
steel mills produced rails
that were around 12 meters long.
Then, out in the field,
these were bolted together
using fish plates.
(soft banjo music fades)
- That would create these little gaps
between the pieces of rail.
And cause this kinda like signature sound,
This ta-tak, ta-tak, right?
And everybody who thinks railroad,
this this ta-tak, ta-tak, ta-tak, ta-tak,
even though we don't hear that anymore.
But we still imagine it
because it was so signature
for the sound to ride on the train
(train wheels clacking)
- The track would flex, causing
the train to rock and roll,
and it would also increase
the wear on the wheels
and create vibrations in the tracks,
so they required frequent maintenance.
So you might expect that
after thermite was invented,
railroads would've been excited
to weld their rails
together with liquid metal,
but that was not the case.
(soft whimsical music)
- They would never have
the idea to weld them.
If he'd come to a railroad
manager and told them,
"I'm Dr. Hans Goldschmidt,
I have a process by which I
can weld your thumbs together."
To these railroad managers,
that would've sounded more useful
than what he actually proposed,
which was welding their rail.
- See, the gaps between rails
were considered essential,
because railroads are
exposed to the elements
all year round.
So, they shrink when
they get cold in winter,
and expand in the heat of summer.
An increase of 40 degrees Celsius
would cause a 12 meter length of rail
to grow by six millimeters.
Without gaps in the rail,
people expected kilometers of railway
to expand and buckle,
leading to the worst possible outcome.
Train derailments.
So if someone pitched,
"We're just gonna connect
all the rails together."
That would be a terrible idea.
- That would be a terrible idea.
(dramatic music)
The longer the rail, the bigger the gap,
the bigger the problem.
And now somebody says, "Hey,
I can make an infinite rail."
That just causes an infinite problem.
(dramatic music continues)
- The first ones that were
actually willing to discuss this
were the tram rails.
Tram rails, they're in cities,
they're embedded into the streets.
Tram rail is much, much smaller,
so the forces are much less.
So, the tram rails were the first ones
that were interested in,
"How can we kind of get rid
of this ta-tak, ta-tak?"
Because it's kind of annoying,
you know, in the middle of the street.
That was basically the first attempts.
And I think in Essen, and
then later on in other cities
(mellow guitar music)
- For this video, I got the opportunity
to weld two rails together using thermite.
And I'm going to take you through
the eight steps in the process.
First, I'll show you how I did it...
(Derek sighs)
Man, this is difficult.
And then we'll compare that
with how the pros do it.
All experiments were performed
under the supervision of professionals,
with proper safety precautions.
Okay. We're out here in
the German countryside,
and tonight they're going
to be welding this rail.
They're gonna do like 150 welds tonight.
(mellow guitar music fades)
When you're welding rail for real,
you wanna do it at the neutral
temperature of the rail.
That is, a predefined
temperature at which the rail
should have no stress in it.
- And is the temperature by
which that piece of track
that you're welding in,
is supposed to have zero tension.
When it gets colder than this,
there's going to be negative tension,
and when it gets warmer,
there's positive tension.
- And since we were filming
in Germany in the summer,
they weld at night, after
the rail has cooled off.
Initially, when the rails are laid out,
they're placed so they're
touching each other.
And the first step in welding rail
is therefore to create a gap into which
we'll pour the liquid thermite steel.
So, you have to cut about
two and a half centimeters
off the end of one rail.
This can be done with a circular saw.
Let's do this.
(circular saw revs)
Cutting a rail.
Out in the field, they cut
their gap with a torch.
(mellow guitar music)
Looks good.
(circular saw buzzing)
(mellow guitar music continues)
Whew!
I just need to take a little break.
Ugh.
That is really exhausting.
(circular saw buzzing)
The next step is to line up the rail
so the weld will make
a seamless connection.
Both rails have to be angled
slightly up toward the gap.
This is because when the liquid
thermite steel is poured in,
it will contract as it cools,
which creates an inward pulling force.
But that force won't
be the same everywhere.
Since there's more metal at the top,
there's more force pulling
the rail together there.
So, that's why the rails
have to be angled up,
so that after the liquid steel contracts,
the rails will be perfectly flat.
- Now you take one of the wrenches,
and put it a little bit under the rail.
- Like there? Or like this?
Sideways.
- Sideways would be a little bit better.
- Yep.
(metal clangs)
- [Christoph] Yep, that's fine.
- [Derek] Okay.
- Same goes for the other side.
We will check.
There's no gap at the moment.
We need 2.42, 3.6 here.
Hit it.
(hammer clangs)
But now this rail is way
higher than this one,
and we want to have both on the same high.
Means now we have to hit this batch.
We do that so long until
we have correct height.
(hammer clangs)
(whimsical music)
Okay, stop.
Up.
(hammer clangs)
- In addition to the vertical alignment,
the rails also have to
be horizontally aligned.
- [Christoph] If we take a look here,
there's a large gap between the
straight edge and the rails.
- [Derek] There's a gap there.
- [Christoph] And they need to-
- [Derek] We need more
of a peak this side.
- [Christoph] Yeah.
- Okay.
(hammer clangs)
And it's a frustrating process,
because trying to align them horizontally
throws out the vertical
alignment and vice versa.
I'm lucky I had help, or I
would've been here for hours.
When we were finally done that,
we double checked the alignment
at the head and foot of the rail,
and we made a terrifying discovery.
- Our rail is twisted.
- [Derek] Even though both
rails were aligned at the top,
One rail was slightly twisted
relative to the other,
which you can see by it
not lining up at the foot.
- [Christoph] We have a maximum tolerance
that is allowed here of two millimeters.
- [Derek] Yep.
- Here we have more than two millimeters,
so we have to untwist the rail.
- This, of course,
throughout the vertical
and horizontal alignment,
so we had to do that all over again.
(hammer clangs)
Are we getting closer?
- [Christoph] A little bit more.
(hammer clangs)
- [Derek] But out in the field,
the guys align the rail
so quickly and easily,
It really is an art.
(hammers clanging)
(objects rattling)
- Now we can adjust the clamping device.
- [Derek] This will hold the mold shoes
and preheating torch in place.
- The preheating torch will sit in here.
- Yeah.
- [Christoph] And we will
keep the molds in place
with that arms here.
- Okay.
- [Christoph] The next step,
we will align the burner.
- It's really important to
align the torch properly,
so that both sides of the
rail get heated equally.
I mean, I think it looks pretty good,
but maybe a little bit that way,
so maybe it could go just a touch.
- [Christoph] There's one
mold, and the plug for you.
- [Derek] Next, we'll put the
molds inside the mold shoes,
attach them to the clamps...
Line 'em up.
And align both sides.
It's essential to make
the seal water tight,
because liquid steel
is as liquid as water,
but almost eight times more dense.
So if it's not sealed properly,
the steel would just pour out.
It looks pretty good.
- [Christoph] I hope so.
(both laughing)
- I didn't expect us to get
it this good on our first go,
after just the trouble aligning the rails.
(whimsical music)
- The alining the rails is
one of the hardest parts.
- Ugh.
It's madness.
So, this is sand? Like beach sand?
- No, it has larger amount of clay inside.
It holds in place and seals.
I will start sealing this side,
you can start sealing this side.
I start sealing with hand,
and I will compact it
with stamping the walls.
(whimsical music)
(tools clattering)
- [Derek] And to make sure
that none of the liquid metal
can spill out,
we pack in additional sand
all over on the sides,
so there's absolutely no gaps.
(tense music)
Then it's time for one of
the most crucial steps,
to preheat the rail.
- [Christoph] Put it
in, tighten the screw,
and the opening the valve.
- [Derek] We also prepared
a demo behind glass,
so we can see into the welding process,
including preheating.
Preheating is essential for a few reasons.
First, it gets rid of any moisture
and other volatiles in the mold,
which would create bubbles
when the molten steel is poured in.
Second, it makes both
rail ends really hot,
which is crucial because
the rate of heat transferred
depends on the difference in temperature
between two materials.
If we poured liquid steel in between
two room temperature rails,
well, the liquid steel would cool rapidly,
and that's a problem.
(tense music)
- We will heat up two pieces of rail...
(torch hisses)
And we will cool down one
really fast in water...
(torch hisses)
And the other one we will
cool down in sand, so, slowly.
(tense music continues)
Just to show how the hardness increase
depending on the cool-down time.
And now you try to break it.
- That's hard to bend, actually.
(Derek grunts)
(whimsical music)
(tool clangs)
(hammer thuds)
Yeah, it's hard to bend.
That's the one that was in the water.
- Yeah.
And we cooled it down really fast.
(whimsical music continues)
(metal clangs)
And that is how to break it.
And now you see how the structure
of the steel has changed.
It breaks very easily.
- [Derek] That's because
when steel cools rapidly,
carbon atoms get trapped in the lattice,
creating this needle-like microstructure.
And that forms a kind of
steel known as martensite.
Martensite is really
hard, but also brittle,
since the lattice can
no longer absorb energy
without fracturing.
(whimsical music fades)
(metal clangs)
(tense music)
- Now we can take a look on the clock.
- Yep.
- We have 1.5 minutes until
we have to remove it again.
- Okay.
The next step is to ignite the thermite.
And it's important to do this right after
we turn off the preheating.
- Five, four, three...
Two, one.
- So, I put the plug in the mold,
and then the thermite bucket on top,
and then I ignited it...
(flame hisses)
Oh my goodness, no!
(tense music)
In making these videos,
the team and I often
travel around the world
talking to scientists and
filming at research facilities.
I mean, guess where I am right now?
We filmed part one of
this video in Germany.
Casper's been in the Netherlands
learning about strongbase,
and Peter has just come
back from trying and failing
to break glass in New York.
It is a great job perk,
but there is one really annoying problem,
which is that it's hard to stay connected
with the rest of the team
while we're out on location.
We either have to pay
ridiculous roaming charges,
or find a local sim card,
or just search around for public wifi.
And as you can imagine,
this isn't something we
really wanna be dealing with
while we're making a video.
Which is why we use this
video sponsor, Saily.
Saily makes it incredibly
easy and affordable
to stay connected while you're abroad.
You download it once,
and then you can use it
in over 180 countries.
Just choose how much data you want,
how long you want it for,
and it's super quick to set up.
All you have to do is select
the country and the plan,
then activate the eSIM, and you're done.
It's also much cheaper than roaming.
Then when you land, you
can automatically connect
to a local network with no hidden charges,
and you're able to do the
important things like access maps,
book a car, or make calls.
So for your next trip, make
sure you scan this QR code
to download the app,
choose a plan in the

So, scan that code, checkout
with code "Veritasium",
and get ready for traveling.
So I wanna say a big thank you to Saily
for sponsoring this video,
and now back to thermite welding.
(tense music)
Oh my goodness!
(Derek laughs)
(intense music)
Woo!
Wow!
(intense music continues)
So, the thermite reaction
is taking place inside.
We're forming molten steel and
also molten aluminum oxide.
(intense music continues)
All these demos are
incredibly difficult to shoot,
because they're gonna be many, many
orders of magnitude brighter
than the normal scene.
So, just getting exposure
is a huge challenge.
Something this reminds me of
is that the power radiated
by something thermally
is proportional to temperature
to the power of four.
So, slight increases in temperature
result in huge increases in power.
(dark tense music)
(torch hisses)
(dark tense music continues)
In the previous video,
we showed what happened in
the crucible through glass.
So, you can see the liquid steel
and the liquid aluminum oxide
forming and separating out,
and then the liquid steel
dropping out the bottom.
Well, here we get to see that liquid steel
falling into the mold.
(dark tense music continues)
So, the liquid steel comes in first,
and it goes all the way to the bottom.
Next, the slag starts to come out.
But since aluminum oxide has
a lower density than steel,
it's just gonna float on top,
and go out the sides into the slag pans.
So, that makes sure that
we don't get any slag
mixed in with the liquid steel.
- That is so awesome.
- [Derek] Yeah.
- [Axel] That is just spectacular.
Whoa!
- [Derek] Ah, that is brilliant.
(tense music)
- And now we wait.
We need the steel to cool long
enough so that it's solid,
but not too long so that
the excess steel and slag
is difficult to remove.
You have to get the time right.
What does he think?
You guys tell me if
it's not liquid anymore.
I believe you.
- Oh, two minutes passed.
So, let's wait 30 seconds more.
- [Derek] After that time has elapsed,
then it's time to essentially
clean up this weld.
So, we can remove the slag
pans and the mold shoes.
(objects clanging)
And we break off the top of this mold.
(soft dramatic music)
These are really single use molds.
They get destroyed in this process.
(machinery humming)
- [Christoph] And now
we put it on the side.
- Put this...
By the slag pens?
- [Christoph] That's fine.
- Then we used a weld shear
that can create up to 20 tons of force
to shear off the excess steel
from the top of the weld.
(weld shear buzzes)
(soft dramatic music fades)
(tense music)
And after that's done,
we hammered off the
remaining excess parts.
(hammer bangs)
That's fun, actually. I like that step.
The next step is to grind down the weld,
so it's exactly the
same level as the rail.
Obviously, you don't want any bumps
when the train is going over it,
but also you don't want any indents,
so this grinding step is really important.
- So, we put on the grinding machine,
and grind until maximum one
millimeter of materials left.
And we try to only grind
on top of the weld.
- Yeah.
(grinder whirring)
(intense music)
(grinders buzzing)
It's normally conducted in two phases.
First there's a rough grind,
and then a finer grind is applied later.
- And we only grinded the top surface.
- Yep.
- We did not grind the running flank.
- Yep.
- [Christoph] Then you have to lift down
the grinding device,
and hold everything so it's even heavier
than the part we've done before.
That's rough grinding right there.
- I'm sweating'
It's like a serious workout.
(Derek chuckles)
The guys in the field
were obviously much better
at grinding down the rail than I was.
So, they would move on,
leaving a still glowing hot
section of the rail behind them.
(mellow music fades)
There probably will be millions of people
watching this video.
What is the likelihood
that they have ridden over
one of your thermite welds?
- They will.
- Hundred percent.
- Hundred percent.
- Anywhere in the world?
- Anywhere in the world.
Of course, there is countries-
- North Korea.
- Where are not the market
leader or something, but...
Finally they will ride above our welds.
(soft tense music)
- [Axel] We'll just cut it out,
and then take it over
to the methodology lab.
(Derek grunts)
- That is heavy.
Oh!
That's my weld.
My first thermite weld.
Man, that is hot.
(Derek exhales)
- This is what you have done yesterday.
We can now put it in the acid.
- What does the acid do to the surface?
- The acid attacks the steel.
But because the orientation
of the crystals,
inside the steel is not the same,
the acid attacks it not in
the same way everywhere.
And because this is different,
you can see different structures.
You can see some fine
structures in the rail,
in the heat-affected zone,
and in, let's say, the fusion zone.
- Mhm.
Can I touch it?
- Yeah.
- [Derek] Yeah, you can't really feel it.
- [Christopher] It's a microscopic basis.
- Yeah.
- You cannot feel it.
- It's interesting, you
can see it, but not-
- Yeah.
- [Derek] And it's a very fine line.
- [Christoph] I mean, you can
see the different structures
of the crystals even.
- [Derek] In the weld, you
can see three different zones.
The normal rail is on either
side with a horizontal grain,
due to how it was rolled
in the steel mill.
In the middle is the thermite steel.
You can still see a bit
of horizontal grain,
but here it doesn't come
from the steel being rolled,
since this just solidified from liquid.
Instead, it formed from
the solidification front,
moving from the sides to the center.
And when the crystals
from both sides meet,
it creates tiny microscopic pores,
resulting in this darker
line in the center.
Now, the boundary of the
thermite steel isn't sharp.
And that's because as the
liquid steel pours in,
it actually melts some of the rail.
This helps it form a strong bond.
- A good weld would be enough
with just one atom layer fused.
But we are using the process
on a construction site.
And on the construction site,
not everything is so good
handled like in a laboratory.
The gap is not a hundred
percent, always the same.
So, we need something robust,
which functions on construction sites.
- [Derek] In Germany,
regulations require melting
of about three millimeters off each rail.
The final zone is in
between the normal rail
and the thermite steel.
This steel didn't melt,
but it received enough heat
that the crystal structure changed,
resulting in a smaller grain structure.
This is known as the Heat Affected Zone.
If you measure the
hardness across the weld,
this zone is actually the weakest,
both in terms of hardness and yield.
The amount of force it takes
to permanently deform the steel.
So if a weld breaks,
it's almost always here.
- [Christoph] That's a line you could see
on that macro etching.
Thermite.
- [Derek] Yep.
- That's a fusion line.
And here we have now
rail seal heat affected.
So, the structure is
changed by heating up,
and then re-crystallization of the steel.
- [Derek] So then I guess the question is,
how strong is rail that's been welded?
Well, at Goldschmidt, they
actually take sections of rail
that they have welded,
and they test them until failure.
- Every 200, basically,
we create one test weld,
and we analyze it in terms of chemistry,
we analyze it in terms of hardness,
and we analyze the bending.
And this is the bending press.
They put this in, right?
And then the force comes
from top and then goes down,
and it breaks it.
And we measure the speed
and also the force.
I'd say, it looks like it's flexing a bit.
- So we're loading up that
weld, bending it until it snaps.
See that curve go.
We wanna see how much
force it takes to snap,
and exactly where that break occurs.
140 tons.
It's getting really deflected now.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- 150 tons.
(metal clangs)
Ooh! That was cool.
I was just expecting a little crack,
like that was catastrophic failure.
(person laughs)
Just over 150 tons.
So, we think the crack propagated
from the bottom upwards?
'Cause it's being pushed down like that.
So, this is under a lot of tension.
- [Axel] Yes.
- So, it breaks under tension
down here, rips up this way.
And so it doesn't break
in the middle of the weld.
You're saying this zone beside it,
which is a previous rail material
that got heated up in the weld.
- Yeah.
- Is actually weaker.
- Yes.
- [Derek] Whoosh.
(grinder buzzes)
Every year, around 2 million welds
are performed using thermite.
And around half use
Goldschmidt's thermite.
Now, each weld creates about
two and a half centimeters of rail.
So, in total, that's 50
kilometers of railroad
created every year out of liquid steel.
- You have a very demanding process,
and you have to make sure that
there's certain properties
with respect to bending,
with respect to tension,
with respect to hardness.
(soft music)
That's a process that needs
to be kind of replicated
every, every, every time,
a million times a year.
- So, with all this continuously welded
rail around the world,
why doesn't it buckle in
summer when it heats up?
Well, that's because there's another way
to change the length of the rail.
Okay, imagine a piece of rail.
If we use a powerful machine
to push on it from both sides,
it will shorten slightly.
And if on the other hand
we pull on the rail,
it will lengthen.
So, you can use mechanical stress
to change the length of the rail.
The fractional change in
length is called "strain".
And if you plot the relationship
between stress and strain,
you find it has a linear relationship,
at least with elastic deformation.
As long as the stresses
applied are not too large,
the rail will spring back
to its original length
when the stress is removed.
And this is key, because
as long as we do that,
we have two ways to change the length.
Thermal and mechanical.
And we can use one to
compensate for the other.
When the rail thermally wants to expand,
we can use mechanical
forces to compress it.
This is what the sleepers
and the ballast are for.
The sleepers pin down the rail,
and the ballast locks
the sleepers in place.
So as the temperature increases,
the rail doesn't lengthen.
Instead, the stress in the rail,
the compressive stress increases.
And the rail just expands
to the top =and sides,
which are unconstrained.
It's also interesting to note
that railroads typically use
as high of a neutral
temperature as they can,
because a rail that
shrinks too much in winter
and cracks under tension
is less problematic
than one that expands too much in summer,
and therefore buckles.
It's also easier to detect a cracked rail
using conductivity measurements
than one that has buckled.
So, thermal expansion and contraction
are counteracted by mechanical stress.
That is the reason why we don't need
expansion joints in railways.
It allows trains to go faster
with fewer bumps and vibrations,
and much less maintenance.
Grady from Practical
Engineering actually made
a whole video about
this, and it's excellent.
I'd recommend it.
So far, we've seen thermite
under normal conditions.
Wow!
Conditions that are expertly tuned
to protect thermite from its environment.
Oh, oh, oh!
But in the next thermite episode,
we'll find out what happens
when this is not the case.
And we'll learn how to work with thermite
under these conditions.
(explosions booming)
So trust me, you don't
want to miss part three.
- [Cameraman] My hands are shaking.
- Right?
Make sure you're
subscribed to get notified
when that video comes out.
(electronic beeping)
