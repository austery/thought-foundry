It
 was
 an
 intense
 time.
 We
 had
 to
 win


football
 games,
 but
 all
 the
 rest
 was
 on


my
 plate
 as
 well.
 I
 need
 a
 break.
 And


you
 cannot
 do
 that
 in
 that
 business.
 You


cannot
 say,
 "Give
 me
 a
 year.
 See
 you


later."
 So,
 it
 begs
 the
 question,
 do
 you


think
 you
 could
 ever
 go
 back
 and
 manage


Liverpool
 again?


>> It's
 possible.
 So,
 what
 would
 it
 take?


Yeah,
 you
 change
 a
 club,
 you
 change
 the


city,
 and
 you
 arrived
 at
 a
 time
 when


clubs
 were
 in
 a
 period
 of
 dysfunction
 to


bring
 that
 club
 back
 to
 its
 glory.
 And


you
 do
 that
 over
 and
 over
 and
 over


again.
 How
 to
 win
 in
 a
 very
 decisive


moment,
 you
 have
 to
 be
 the
 best
 team.


And
 to
 be
 the
 best
 team,
 everybody
 has


to
 buy
 into
 that
 team
 and
 walk
 through


fire
 together.
 How
 do
 I
 get
 people
 to


walk
 through
 fire?
 I
 better
 go
 back
 to


the
 start.
 Growing
 up,
 my
 mom
 was
 very


caring.
 She
 loved
 people
 and
 my
 dad
 had


expectations.
 The
 problem
 was
 I
 was


absolutely
 useless
 in
 most
 of
 the


things.
 Even
 with
 football,
 my
 teammates


were
 better
 than
 me
 and
 I
 thought
 I
 only


can
 get
 on
 that
 level
 from
 the
 first


until
 last
 minute.
 I
 was
 a
 warrior
 on


the
 pitch.
 But
 it
 made
 me
 the
 guy
 I
 am


today.
 And
 so
 my
 team
 plays
 a
 little
 bit


more
 like
 a
 heavy
 metal
 band
 because
 you


have
 90
 minutes
 and
 there's
 no
 guarantee


to
 get
 anything
 but
 the
 only
 chance
 to


get
 something
 is
 to
 give
 your
 all.
 So


you
 want
 to
 have
 the
 maximum
 success.


Don't
 waste
 time
 with
 holding
 back.
 I


want
 to
 know
 why
 Manchester
 United


didn't.


>> No,
 they
 tried
 but
 there
 are
 some


reasons
 in
 that
 conversation
 which
 I


didn't
 like.


>> Arie
 slot
 coming
 in
 after
 you
 and
 didn't


change
 much.


>> That's
 super
 smart.
 Not
 changing
 much


and
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 you
 win
 the
 league


by
 some
 distance.


>> But
 this
 year
 Liverpool
 have
 spent
 what


450
 odd
 million.
 You
 never
 had
 a


transfer
 window
 like
 that.


>> Nobody
 ever
 told
 me
 that
 it's
 possible


that
 we
 can
 spend
 that.


>> You
 seem
 to
 always
 be
 successful.
 How


does
 someone
 succeed
 you?


>> You
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 become
 the
 best


team
 in
 England?
 you
 need
 to


[Applause]


[Music]

 journey
 with

 and
 I


appreciate
 you
 for

 So,
 yeah,
 thank


you


[Music]


>> Den
 to
 understand
 you
 and
 the
 man
 and


the
 anomaly
 that
 you
 went
 on
 to
 be
 in


your
 career
 and
 still
 are.
 What
 do
 I


need
 to
 understand
 about
 your
 very


earliest
 context
 where
 you
 came
 from
 and


how
 can
 you
 point
 out
 to
 me
 how
 that


very
 early
 context
 created
 the
 person


you
 are
 today
 and
 that
 everybody
 knows


you
 to
 be.


I
 think
 we
 all
 are
 who
 we
 are
 because


the
 environment
 we
 we
 grew
 up.
 My
 dad


was
 a
 salesman
 and
 my
 mom
 came
 from
 a


family
 and
 my
 grandpa
 had
 a
 brewery
 and


she
 worked
 there
 blah
 blah
 blah
 and
 all


this
 kind
 of
 things.
 So,
 but
 her
 only


purpose
 was
 her
 kids.
 She
 loved
 me
 more


than
 her
 own
 life
 definitely.
 And
 my
 dad


had
 expectations.
 He
 loved
 me
 as
 well,


but
 he
 had
 expectations
 where
 my
 mom


didn't.
 So,
 my
 mom
 was
 just
 happy
 that
 I


was
 there
 and
 my
 dad
 had
 always


something
 um
 where
 he
 was
 not
 really


happy
 with.
 And
 all
 the
 things
 my
 dad


wanted
 me
 to
 do,
 I
 love
 doing.
 So,
 he


wanted
 me
 to
 to
 to
 to
 be
 a
 sports
 guy.


each
 sport,
 tennis,
 skiing,
 football,


that
 was
 his
 life.
 So
 he
 wanted
 that
 his


son
 is
 good
 at
 that
 and
 he
 loved
 doing


it.
 If
 I
 would
 have
 been,
 I
 don't
 know,


sitting
 at
 home
 and
 and
 drawing
 or


whatever,
 he
 would
 every
 day
 take
 me
 out


and
 say,
 "Go
 outside
 and
 and
 and
 play


something."
 But
 then
 pretty
 quick
 when
 I


became
 better,
 it
 was
 never
 good
 enough.


And
 he
 always
 So
 that
 was
 the
 process.


So
 that's
 how
 I
 was
 brought
 up.
 That's


him.
 That's
 definitely


Yeah.


Can
 I
 keep
 these
 pictures?
 Of
 course
 you


can
 keep.
 That's
 good.
 That's
 good


because
 I
 have
 them,
 but
 I'm
 not
 sure


where.
 Yeah,
 exactly.


Good
 looking
 guy.
 Yeah.


>> Was
 he
 a
 tough
 tough
 man?


>> Yeah.


I
 It's
 not
 long
 ago.
 I
 never
 I
 never
 got


hit
 by
 whatever.
 Never.
 Never.
 Never.
 He


was
 just
 He
 wanted
 to
 to
 bring
 the
 best


out
 of
 me.
 I
 think
 that
 was
 what
 he


wanted.
 Tough
 in
 a
 way.
 Yeah.
 how
 people


who
 are
 brought
 up
 in
 in
 that
 time


probably
 but
 not
 tough
 endless
 that
 you


thought
 I
 do
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 to


do
 anything
 with
 him
 no
 I
 loved
 him
 to


bits
 and
 he
 loved
 me
 he
 was
 very
 proud


but
 never
 never
 said
 it
 and
 these
 kind


of
 things
 so
 was
 he
 was
 a
 good
 guy
 a


real
 good
 guy
 but
 with
 his
 son
 he
 wanted


him
 to
 be
 ambitious
 and
 was
 a
 bit
 afraid


that
 I
 might
 be
 not
 ambitious
 enough
 so


>> competitive
 man
 I
 hear


>> yeah
 yeah yeah


>> so
 reading
 about
 stories
 of
 um
 him


racing
 you
 on
 ski
 slopes
 and
 and
 sprint


races
 and
 never
 letting
 you
 win.


>> That's
 true.
 Who
 knows
 if
 it
 was
 right.


Probably
 it
 was
 right.
 I
 I
 don't
 know.


It
 was
 not
 nice
 in
 a
 way.
 When
 you
 tell


the
 story,
 it's
 like
 my
 god,
 come
 on,


let
 the
 poor
 boy
 win
 or
 whatever.
 But


you
 had
 no
 chance.
 It's
 just
 you
 stand


on
 the
 touch
 line
 and
 you
 run
 to
 the


halfway
 line.
 And
 when
 you
 when
 you
 look


back
 over
 the
 the
 course
 of
 your
 career,


are
 there
 moments
 where
 you
 have


flashback
 to
 lessons
 that
 he
 taught
 you


or
 principles
 or
 values
 that
 he
 taught


you
 that
 you
 think,
 gosh,
 I
 got
 that


from
 my
 dad?
 The
 one
 skill


I
 I
 realized
 that
 my
 dad
 had
 without


knowing
 that
 time.
 It
 was
 a
 skill
 he


could
 speak
 publicly.
 You
 don't
 know


that
 you
 have
 that,
 but
 I
 have
 it.
 You


today
 I
 know
 it.
 I
 I
 don't
 care
 if
 a


camera
 is
 in
 my
 face
 or
 whatever.
 I
 say


what
 I
 have
 to
 say
 in
 that
 moment
 um


without
 being
 too
 worried
 what
 might


people
 think
 about
 it
 if
 I'm
 convinced


it's
 right
 and
 I
 I
 say
 talking
 in
 public


is
 not
 a
 problem
 it's
 probably
 from
 him


my
 law
 for
 people


unintentionally
 that's
 from
 my
 mom
 so


this
 mix
 of
 a
 very
 confident
 and
 a
 very


caring
 very
 confident
 dad
 and
 very


caring
 mom


is
 where
 I
 was
 brought
 up
 in
 the
 middle


of
 And
 you
 wanted
 to
 be
 a
 doctor
 before


before
 then.
 So
 you
 were
 aiming
 to
 be
 a


doctor.
 That
 didn't
 work
 out.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 true.


>> Why?
 Why?
 Why
 doctor?


>> No,
 it
 was
 always
 it
 was
 something
 I


wanted
 to
 do.
 So
 in
 all
 this
 wonderful


upbringing,
 it
 was
 pretty
 clear
 that


money
 is
 an
 issue.
 Not
 in
 a
 sense
 that


we
 didn't
 have
 enough.
 We
 always
 had


kind
 of
 enough.
 But
 I
 remember


discussions,
 bad
 discussions
 about


money,
 arguments
 if
 you
 want,
 who
 spent


that,
 who
 spent
 that.
 I
 was
 a
 little


one.
 I
 just
 sat
 around
 and
 listened
 to


it.
 But
 there
 was
 a
 moment
 in
 my
 life


when
 I
 when
 I
 realized
 I
 have
 to
 earn
 a


lot
 of
 money
 that
 I
 can
 sort
 it
 all.
 I


want
 to
 earn
 money
 to
 not
 having
 this


kind
 of
 discussions


with
 my
 wife
 or
 with
 the
 kids
 or


whatever.
 So
 it
 grew
 as
 a
 as
 a
 as
 a


thought
 when
 you
 are
 a
 young
 man
 and
 you


think
 what
 could
 you
 do
 with
 life
 and


for
 me
 it
 was
 clear
 I
 cannot
 earn
 my


money
 with
 football
 because
 in
 my
 mind
 I


wasn't
 good
 enough
 and
 then
 I
 got


surprised
 by
 some
 people
 they
 thought
 oh


there's
 something
 um
 that
 could
 be


interesting.


>> What
 did
 they
 see
 in
 you
 as
 a
 football


player?
 What
 was
 it
 that
 they
 they
 saw


in
 you
 as
 a
 young
 man?
 cuz
 I've
 got
 all


these
 wonderful
 photos
 of
 you
 as
 a
 young


player
 and


>> oh
 my
 god.


So
 in
 my
 village
 I
 was
 the
 best
 player


in
 my
 village.
 So
 I
 scored
 the
 goals.
 I


was
 the
 fastest.
 All
 this
 kind
 this


physical
 talent.
 I
 was
 really
 fast.


Later
 on
 when
 I
 studied
 sport
 science
 I


could
 jump
 far.
 I
 could
 jump
 high.
 All


these
 kind
 of
 things.
 So
 it
 was
 a


physical
 talent.
 I
 was
 literally


surprised
 by
 the
 approach
 from
 from


professional
 football
 clubs.
 I
 didn't


think
 who's
 coming.
 So
 it
 was
 like
 the


question
 was
 are
 you
 number
 seven
 from


the
 game
 before?
 Yeah.
 Oh
 come
 on
 let's


have
 a
 chat.
 Do
 you
 want
 to
 come
 to


Frankfurt?
 That
 was
 the
 question.
 It
 was


before
 that
 was
 80


>> 87.


>> And
 you
 were
 20
 years
 old
 at
 the
 time


when
 you
 went
 to
 Frankfurt.


>> Yeah.


>> Well
 I
 mean
 a
 lot
 happens
 in
 your
 20th


year
 of
 life.


>> Yeah.


>> A
 lot
 happens.


>> There
 was
 a
 change.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 I
 came
 to


Frankfurt.


I
 it
 didn't
 take
 long
 that
 I
 met
 Mark's


mom.


>> Yeah.
 Your
 son's
 mom.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 And
 then
 um
 she
 got


pregnant
 and
 um
 December
 88
 I
 became
 a


father.


>> Were
 you
 scared?
 20
 years
 old
 become
 a


father


>> massively.
 When
 I
 heard
 she's
 pregnant
 I


was
 I
 wanted
 to
 run
 away
 go
 oh
 god
 it's


not
 me.


So
 the
 moment
 when
 I
 when
 I
 got
 aware
 of


the
 fact
 that
 I
 will
 be
 a
 dad,
 I
 was


really
 scared.
 The
 night
 13th
 December


of
 December
 1988
 when
 Mark
 was
 born
 was


the
 night
 when
 I
 became
 an
 adult
 and
 the


night
 who
 changed
 my
 life


in
 the
 right
 direction.
 From
 that
 moment


on,
 I
 was
 always
 more
 an
 adult
 than
 all


the
 other
 people
 in
 the


in
 my
 age
 group.
 So
 they
 were
 the


university,
 they
 were
 on
 parties,
 I


couldn't
 go.
 They
 went
 on
 holiday.
 I


couldn't
 I
 played
 football,
 low
 wages,


third
 division
 Germany.
 Had
 two
 other


jobs,
 one
 in
 the
 morning,
 one
 at
 night.


Um
 and
 and
 playing
 semi-professional


football.
 That
 taught
 me
 the
 discipline.


I
 didn't
 have
 to
 learn
 at
 home
 because
 I


had
 no
 no
 jobs
 to
 do
 in
 the
 house.
 So
 I


got
 it
 a
 bit
 later
 but
 um
 it
 made
 me
 the


guy
 I
 am
 today.


>> Because
 of
 that
 experience
 when
 you


became
 a
 manager
 yourself
 did
 that


become
 a
 bit
 of a
 personal
 reference


point
 to
 understand
 the
 individuals
 that


you
 were
 managing?
 Because
 if
 you
 were


managing
 a
 21-year-old
 dad
 versus
 a


21-year-old
 that
 didn't
 have
 kids,


did
 you
 understand
 them
 to
 be
 different?


M


>> one
 is
 in
 your,
 you
 know,
 in
 your
 own


words,
 one
 is
 potentially
 a
 man
 and
 an


adult
 and
 one
 doesn't
 know
 what
 that
 is


yet.


>> Yes,
 of
 course.
 I
 I I
 don't,
 but
 I
 say
 I


like
 people
 and
 I'm
 super
 curious.


Everybody
 has
 a
 story
 to
 tell,
 so
 I
 want


to
 hear
 it.


>> I
 think
 I
 think
 I
 asked
 that
 question
 in


part
 cuz
 I
 heard
 stories
 that
 Sir
 Alex


Ferguson
 would
 prefer
 players
 who
 had
 a


girlfriend


>> or
 a
 wife
 and
 kids.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 was
 I
 was
 wondering
 if
 there's
 any


truth
 to
 that,
 if
 they
 have
 a
 different


stability
 or


>> Oh,
 it's
 probably
 Yeah.


There
 are
 couple
 problems
 you
 can
 you


can
 have
 a
 great
 partner
 married
 or
 not


and
 then
 everything
 is
 fine.
 It's
 the


wrong
 partner
 it's
 not
 great.
 You
 have


no
 partner
 not
 great
 for
 some
 and
 you


have
 too
 many
 it's
 not
 great.
 So
 there


are
 so
 many
 things
 in
 life.
 So
 I
 haven't


never
 I
 never
 thought
 about
 that.
 I


heard
 about
 it
 at
 coaches
 Germany
 very


successful
 manager
 Oreleer
 I
 love
 him
 to


bits
 fantastic
 guy.
 he
 had
 as
 well,
 I


think
 he
 said
 it
 once
 as
 well
 that
 he


wants
 um
 married
 players
 because
 they
 go


home
 and
 stuff
 like
 this.
 Yeah,


that's
 not
 that's
 one
 part
 of
 of
 the


personality
 but
 not
 the
 overwhelming
 or


the
 the
 most
 decisive
 or
 whatever.
 So,


it's
 like
 and
 you
 need
 on
 the
 football


is
 a
 football
 game.
 You
 need
 the
 cheeky


the
 cheeky
 ones
 as
 well.
 So
 you
 need


them
 the
 one
 who
 the
 street
 smart
 you


need
 as
 well
 they
 get
 out
 of
 situations


in
 life
 and
 on
 the
 pitch
 stuff
 like


this.
 So
 it's
 a
 mix
 of
 everything.


That's
 what
 I
 loved
 about
 football


teams.
 I
 I
 treated
 them


let
 me
 say
 50%
 of
 the
 time
 completely


the
 same
 and
 50%
 what
 he
 needs
 what
 he


needs
 what
 he
 needs
 but
 in
 front
 of
 the


other
 teammates.


So
 people,
 players
 came
 to
 me,
 why
 do


you
 um
 treat
 me
 like
 that?
 You
 would


have
 ne
 would
 never
 say
 that
 to
 him.
 No,


because
 he's
 from
 Argentina,
 grew
 up


without
 a
 window
 and
 you
 are
 from
 Munich


and
 everything
 was
 fine.
 You
 want
 me
 to


treat
 you
 like
 him?
 Really?
 To
 bring
 all


these
 people
 from
 different
 areas
 in
 the


world
 together,
 you
 cannot
 expect
 that


they
 all
 tick
 the
 same
 way.
 It's
 just


not
 possible.
 Growing
 up
 in
 Germany
 is


obviously
 different
 to
 growing
 up
 in


Seneagal.
 It
 is
 different.
 So,
 but
 then


we
 come
 together
 in
 dressing
 room
 and


then
 everybody
 says,
 "So,
 this
 is
 the


rule
 for
 all
 of
 you."
 And
 yeah,
 be
 in


time
 of
 course
 for
 all
 easy.
 But
 then


all
 the
 other
 stuff,
 come
 on,
 calm
 down.


You
 want
 a
 um
 a
 football
 team


full
 of
 different


skill
 sets,
 full
 of
 different
 talent,


full
 of
 different
 personality.
 want
 that


because
 that's
 what
 you
 need.
 That
 what


makes
 you
 unpredictable.
 But
 then
 you


put
 just
 one
 I
 don't
 know
 helmet
 over
 it


and
 say
 so
 that's
 for
 all
 of
 you.
 That's


how
 we
 go.
 There
 are
 moments
 in
 the
 game


where
 they
 have
 to
 act
 like
 that.
 In
 all


the
 other
 in
 all
 the
 other
 moments
 they


have
 to
 be
 themselves.
 So
 treat
 them


like
 that.
 This
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


shocking,
 counterintuitive


um
 ideas
 that
 I've
 that
 that
 I
 heard


from
 players
 with
 other
 managers


specifically
 cuz
 I've
 just
 interviewed


so
 many
 of
 Sar
 Alex
 Ferguson's
 former


players.
 One
 of
 the
 shocking
 things
 they


all
 said
 was
 that
 he
 treated
 people


differently.
 And
 to
 hear
 you
 say
 the


same
 thing
 as
 well,
 it
 it
 it
 really
 is


the
 opposite
 of
 what
 you
 hear
 in


business.
 In
 business,
 you
 hear
 that
 you


have
 to
 be
 a
 consistent
 leader,
 that
 you


have
 to
 be
 consistent,
 treat
 people
 the


same.
 Um
 but
 in
 the
 world
 of
 football


people
 like
 you
 tell
 me
 that's


>> I
 think
 I
 think
 in
 business
 in
 life
 it's


the
 same.
 So


to
 lead
 that's
 one
 number
 one
 thing
 you


lead
 yourself
 so
 that's
 the
 first
 one
 in


the
 morning
 you
 stand
 up
 you
 have
 to


kick
 your
 own
 but
 say
 come
 on
 it's
 not


the
 greatest
 day
 but
 anyhow
 we
 go
 and


then
 then
 the
 people
 you
 lead
 you
 need


to
 understand
 to
 do
 it
 properly.
 So
 now


that
 means
 you
 you
 you
 talk
 to
 them,
 you


listen
 to
 them,
 you
 ask
 them
 where
 are


you
 from,
 what's
 your
 background,
 what


are
 we
 doing
 here
 and
 there
 blah
 blah


and
 why
 did
 you
 that
 and
 stuff
 like


this.
 So
 it
 means
 it's
 already
 in
 that


conversation
 it's
 clear


he's
 different
 to
 the
 other
 guy.
 It's


not
 about
 the
 rules
 like
 punctuality


early
 in
 late
 out
 not
 about
 these
 kind


of
 things
 but
 how
 can
 we
 get
 the
 best


out
 of
 people
 if
 you
 treat
 them
 all
 the


same?
 It's
 it's
 crazy.
 It's
 in
 business.


I
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 is
 like
 that,
 but


I've
 never
 I
 only
 worked
 in
 this


football
 business.
 Or
 maybe
 it's
 just


working
 here.
 I
 cannot
 see
 that.
 For
 me,


it's
 super
 important
 that
 you
 really


pick
 the
 individual
 from
 where
 it


stands,
 not
 from
 where
 you
 want
 it
 to


be.
 No,
 actually
 where
 it
 actually
 is.


>> Can
 you
 give
 me
 an
 example
 that
 I
 would


know
 of
 two
 people
 that
 you
 treated


differently
 and
 why
 you
 made
 the


decision
 to
 treat
 them
 differently
 based


on
 their
 origin?


>> So,
 you
 have
 a
 young
 player
 as
 an


example.
 So
 you
 trend
 Alexan
 Allen
 comes


up
 to
 the
 first
 team.
 So
 and
 then
 you


and
 James
 Milner
 is
 already
 I
 don't
 know


31
 or
 whatever
 how
 oldever
 he
 was
 that


time.
 So
 you
 James
 makes
 clear
 first
 and


foremost
 that
 trend
 doesn't
 go
 crazy.
 So


because
 he
 sorts
 all
 these
 kind
 of


things
 but
 there
 are
 so
 many
 things


where
 just
 as
 an
 example
 but
 James


doesn't
 have
 to
 do
 this
 and
 that
 because


you
 know
 he
 is
 doing
 it
 anyway.
 So
 for


for
 trend
 you
 still
 have
 to
 educate
 the


boy.
 this
 example
 which
 you
 probably


didn't
 think
 of
 but
 it
 explains
 how
 how


different
 they
 are.
 There
 are
 different


age
 groups.
 One
 is
 16
 or
 17
 and
 the


other
 one
 is
 33.
 So
 that
 shows
 already


that's
 not
 possible.


>> So
 you
 are
 talking
 about
 the
 rules
 in


football.
 So
 everybody
 has
 to
 work
 hard.


Everybody
 has
 to
 do
 in
 my
 kid
 everybody


has
 to
 defend


the
 out
 of
 the
 opposition
 team.
 So


that's
 everybody
 has
 to
 buy
 into
 that.


There's
 no
 no
 no.
 I
 always
 said
 if
 if


you're
 not
 Leon
 Messi,
 you
 have
 to


defend.
 You
 have
 you
 have
 to
 defend.
 So


because
 I
 never
 had
 Leo
 Messi,
 so
 they


all
 had
 to
 defend
 for
 everybody
 has
 to


do
 that.
 But
 then
 to
 get
 there
 that
 that


they
 that
 they
 really
 grow
 together
 as
 a


group


in
 a
 group
 everybody
 except
 that
 they


are
 different
 otherwise
 we
 are
 I
 don't


know
 an
 army
 and
 and
 they
 are
 different


but
 it's
 not
 I
 mean
 just
 because
 we
 wear


the
 same
 shirt
 we
 have
 all
 our
 own


qualities.
 So
 and
 to
 that
 to
 bring
 them


to
 life
 or
 let
 them
 shine.
 Yeah.
 You


have
 to
 be
 to
 have
 to
 get
 treated
 in
 the


right
 way.
 And
 that's
 what
 what
 I
 loved


to
 figure
 out
 how
 is
 that
 how
 is
 that


possible?
 That
 was
 the
 conversations
 I


had
 the
 conversation
 with
 players
 during


a
 season.
 Of
 course
 there
 were
 football


talks
 but
 we
 had
 already
 enough


meetings.
 The
 the
 most
 important


conversations
 were
 the
 private


conversations.


Why
 are
 so
 when
 when
 the
 play
 is
 not


training
 well


could
 be
 could
 that
 he
 just
 is
 not
 ready


for
 training
 had
 a
 drink
 last
 night


didn't
 sleep
 enough
 or
 you
 ask
 so
 that's


all
 what
 you
 think
 he
 looks
 like
 he


didn't
 sleep
 enough
 blah
 blah
 blah
 bring


him
 in
 ask
 him
 what's
 going
 on
 and
 he


will
 be
 surprised
 most
 of
 the
 time
 they


either
 slept
 enough
 or
 didn't
 sleep


enough
 for
 the
 right
 reason
 because


something
 happened
 and
 nobody
 could


sleep
 they
 had
 no
 drink
 blah
 blah
 blah


but
 they
 lost
 focus
 right
 now
 because


massive
 problems
 at
 home
 you
 without


asking
 you
 will
 never
 find
 out
 so
 here's


one
 guy
 with
 problem
 here's
 another
 guy


he's
 flying
 don't
 treat
 them
 the
 same


>> so
 one
 needs
 more
 support
 and
 the
 other


one
 you
 need
 to
 bring
 down
 a
 little
 bit


so
 all
 these
 kind
 that's
 how
 you
 work


with
 people
 in
 the
 end
 what
 you
 want
 is


that
 the
 job
 of
 a
 leader
 is
 to
 make
 the


target
 the
 aim
 the
 final
 destination


whatever
 that
 clear
 like
 the
 sun
 that


everybody's
 automatically


going
 there
 and
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 push


them
 every
 day
 and
 say
 by
 the
 way


there's
 the
 sign
 that's
 around
 there
 so


that
 that
 they
 know
 it
 on
 the
 way
 there


you
 support
 them
 in
 different
 in


different
 ways
 it's
 not
 so
 important


what
 I
 want
 to
 say


in
 a
 moment
 of
 anger
 or
 whatever
 it


happens
 emotion
 do
 that
 to
 us
 especially


around
 a
 football
 game
 you
 shout


something
 did
 I
 really
 say
 that
 did
 I


did
 I
 I
 did
 that
 but
 it's
 not
 so


important
 in
 a
 talk
 conversation
 with


people
 they
 which
 depend
 on
 you,
 you
 are


responsible
 for
 it's
 not
 so
 important


what
 you
 say
 it's
 much
 more
 important


what
 they
 need
 to
 hear
 it's
 not
 them


telling
 them
 what
 they
 want
 to
 hear
 no


what
 they
 need
 to
 hear
 to
 deal
 with


their
 situation
 so
 that's
 what


leadership
 means
 not
 just
 telling
 them


off
 for
 whatever
 that
 doesn't
 work
 that


doesn't
 work
 try
 to
 understand
 why
 and


that
 was
 I
 I
 love
 that
 part
 in
 my
 job


and
 I
 still
 do
 that
 if
 you
 want
 um
 right


now
 not
 with
 world
 class
 players
 all
 the


time
 or
 coaches,
 point
 directors,


whatever.
 They're
 all
 young
 um
 younger


than
 me
 at
 least.
 And
 um
 that's
 how
 I


understand
 my
 role
 and
 understood
 my


role.


>> Was
 there
 certain
 players
 in
 your
 team


that
 you
 felt
 you
 could
 be
 tougher
 with


and
 others
 that
 you
 felt
 you
 could
 never


really
 be
 tough
 with
 because
 that
 would


make
 that
 would
 hurt
 their
 performance.


I'm
 reflecting.


>> Yeah.
 Of
 of
 course
 of
 course
 you
 have


the
 Sadio
 Mani
 and
 and
 and
 Mosala
 are


two
 top
 examples.
 So


>> in
 the
 end
 there
 are
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 people


who
 saw
 it
 coming.
 We
 knew
 they
 are


great.
 We
 knew
 they
 are
 massive
 talents.


They
 have
 fantastic
 potential
 but
 they


were
 not
 who
 they
 became
 later
 on
 in


that
 time.
 It's
 not
 that
 they
 came
 to


Liverpool
 and
 said
 boss
 just
 want
 to


tell
 you
 I
 defend
 anyway
 so
 we
 don't


have
 to
 talk
 about
 that.
 Just
 explain
 me


how
 we
 do
 it.
 And
 we
 obviously
 to
 to
 be


successful
 as
 a
 football
 team
 you
 have


to
 organize
 a
 football
 team
 to
 get


stability.
 To
 get
 stability
 you
 need
 to


find
 a
 way
 to
 defend
 properly
 and


together.
 If
 you
 have
 that
 based
 on
 that


they
 can
 start
 flying
 then
 we
 then
 let's


talk
 about
 the
 football
 part.
 So
 and
 now


there
 are
 obviously
 no
 defenders
 but
 we


were
 famous
 for
 our
 pressing
 and
 counter


pressing.
 I
 talked
 a
 lot
 to
 them
 and
 it


was
 and
 the
 the
 way
 we
 spoke
 about
 it


was
 just
 100%
 clear.
 You
 want
 to
 win


more
 often
 than
 not.
 You
 want
 to
 have


the
 maximum
 success.
 You
 want
 to
 be
 able


to
 become
 the
 best
 team
 in
 England
 at


one
 point.
 Yeah.
 Okay
 then
 do
 that.
 Come


on.
 So
 agreement
 and
 then
 from
 there
 we


went
 on
 but
 then
 with
 years
 and
 not


because
 they
 changed
 or
 whatever
 here
 a


little
 bit
 less
 there
 a
 little
 bit
 less


and
 I
 have
 to
 decide
 do
 I
 go
 for
 them


like
 I
 would
 go
 for
 a
 young
 boy
 playing


in
 that
 position
 and
 say
 come
 on


turn
 run
 fight
 jump
 and
 take
 them
 off
 in


a
 moment
 over
 no
 of
 course
 not
 you
 don't


do
 that
 in
 that
 moment
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


story
 in
 the
 newspaper
 we
 had
 this
 one


argument
 I
 think
 with
 Mo
 at
 Westam
 at
 at


the
 sideline
 when
 it
 didn't
 start
 and
 I


brought
 him
 on
 and
 he
 was
 not
 happy.
 The


problem
 our
 problems
 then
 are
 always
 in


public.


>> That
 was
 not
 real
 big
 thing
 but
 in
 the


moment
 we
 didn't
 agree
 definitely.


So
 um
 how
 do
 you
 deal
 with
 that
 the
 next


day
 I
 I
 think
 I
 can
 say
 um
 we
 have
 a


very
 good
 relationship
 today
 um
 even


though
 on
 that
 day
 it
 didn't
 look
 like


and
 that's
 all
 the
 things.
 So
 you
 learn


you
 try
 to
 do
 it
 the
 right
 way.
 You
 try


to
 show
 the
 players
 respect
 but
 at
 one


point
 it's
 never
 enough
 and
 you
 have
 to


accept
 that
 as
 well
 because


the
 players
 they
 grow
 they
 get
 bigger


and
 bigger
 and
 bigger
 and
 at
 one
 point


you
 hear
 years
 later
 he
 never
 spoke
 to


me
 whatever
 another
 player
 from
 wherever


says
 about
 a
 former
 coach
 about
 me
 about


Mourinho
 he
 never
 spoke
 to
 me


I
 know
 we
 spoke
 a
 lot
 we
 just
 can't


remember
 and
 we
 didn't
 speak
 what
 you


wanted
 or
 we
 And
 I
 didn't
 tell
 you
 what


you
 wanted
 to
 hear.
 So
 you
 can
 never


make
 it
 100%
 right.
 But
 you
 can
 only
 do


as
 good
 as
 you
 as
 it's
 possible
 for
 you.


And
 that's
 what
 I
 tried
 all
 the
 time
 to


create
 a
 relationship
 where
 even
 when
 we


had
 arguments,
 we
 always
 found
 a
 way
 out


as
 me
 player
 and
 it
 never
 um
 got
 carried


into
 the
 team
 that
 I
 lost
 respect,
 they


lost
 respect
 for
 me
 because
 I
 acted
 that


way.
 is
 we
 always
 stayed
 together.
 We


always
 find
 a
 way
 that
 they
 understood,


okay,
 it's
 really
 important
 that
 we
 get


through
 this,
 that
 they
 sort
 it,
 the


boss
 sort
 it
 with
 him
 or
 the
 boss
 sorts


it
 with
 us,
 that
 we
 can
 go
 from
 here


again.


>> From
 a
 very
 young
 age,
 one
 of the
 things


I
 found
 really
 surprising
 is
 in
 as
 I
 was


going
 through
 all
 of
 these
 football


teams
 you
 played
 in
 as
 a
 young
 man,
 it


appeared
 that
 you
 were
 always
 the


captain,
 repeatedly
 assigned
 to
 be
 the


captain.
 And
 I
 wondered
 why.
 What
 was
 it


that
 you
 were
 doing
 from
 a
 very
 young


age
 that
 meant
 all
 of
 your
 coaches
 back


then
 asked
 you
 to
 be
 captain
 of
 the


team?


>> I
 have
 no
 clue.
 The
 coach
 I
 learned
 the


most
 of
 Alfkang
 Frank
 um
 when
 he
 came


back
 to
 mines,
 he
 was
 at
 Mines
 very


successful
 spell
 left
 and
 then
 we
 were


in
 trouble
 again.
 He
 came
 back
 and
 I
 was


the
 captain
 and
 we
 had
 a
 very


experienced
 player
 from
 a
 first
 division


team
 coming
 to
 mind
 in
 the
 second


division.
 Lmid
 was
 his
 name.
 So
 and
 Wolf


Gang


Y
 can
 we
 talk?
 Yeah,
 of
 course.


I
 want
 to
 make
 last
 the
 captain.
 Oh,


yeah.
 Good.
 So
 then
 you
 are
 not
 captain.


Yeah,
 I
 know.
 So
 it
 was
 exactly
 like


that.
 It
 meant
 nothing
 to
 me.
 So
 my
 role


was
 not
 I
 was
 a
 leader
 in
 the
 team.
 Not


on
 purpose.
 I
 was
 on
 the
 pitch
 an


aggressive
 leader
 which
 I
 didn't
 like.


So
 heart
 rate
 above
 140,
 I
 lost
 it
 very


often
 in
 a
 very
 very
 not
 a
 good
 way.
 So


really
 aggressive
 talk,


shouting
 at
 everybody
 and
 in
 all
 that


really
 was
 I
 had
 to
 very
 often
 I
 had
 to


apologize
 to
 my
 teammates.


>> Where
 did
 that
 come
 from?
 Because
 you're


I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know.


>> There's
 a
 real
 dichotomy
 with
 you


because
 you're
 such
 a
 sweet,
 kind
 guy.


You
 have
 your
 mother
 in
 you
 in
 terms
 of


the
 empathy
 and
 the
 love
 of
 people,
 but


then
 there's
 this
 other


>> explosive
 part.


>> I
 didn't
 like
 it
 at
 all.
 And
 I
 was


afraid
 when
 I
 stopped
 playing
 that
 it


that
 I'd
 take
 it
 over.
 So
 I
 was


emotional.
 I
 was
 had
 moments
 where
 I


lost
 it
 with
 referees
 and
 stuff
 like


that.
 But
 generally
 I'm
 I
 was
 really
 I'm


I'm
 a
 very
 calm
 person.
 So
 people
 think


because
 I'm
 probably
 I
 think
 I'm
 a


motivator
 or
 whatever.
 I
 do
 get
 up
 in


the
 morning
 and
 come
 in
 the
 dressing


room
 and
 say
 come
 on
 boys
 today
 we
 go


again.
 Not
 at
 all.
 I
 mean
 it
 happens


from
 time
 to
 time
 but
 not
 that
 often.
 No


I
 have
 no
 explanation
 for
 it.
 If
 I
 would


have
 had
 an
 explanation,
 it
 was
 a
 little


bit
 I
 knew
 I'm
 not
 good
 enough.


Actually,
 my
 my
 teammates
 were
 better


than
 me.
 And
 I
 thought
 I
 only
 can
 get
 on


that
 level
 if
 I
 squeeze
 everything
 out


on
 from
 an
 aggressive
 point
 of
 view,


stuff
 like
 this.
 So
 that
 was
 a
 bit
 my


explanation
 because
 they
 are
 so
 much


better.
 But
 if
 I
 calm
 down
 and
 want
 to


play
 cool
 football,
 yeah,
 I'm
 out.


>> You
 eventually
 become
 the
 manager
 of


mines.
 Yeah,
 you're
 my
 age
 when
 you
 get


that
 job
 and
 the
 the
 former
 manager's


been
 sacked.
 The
 club
 have
 never
 gotten


to
 the
 Bundesliga,
 the
 the
 first


division
 in
 Germany.


You
 don't
 have
 experience
 managing
 a


club
 of
 this
 size
 or
 scale
 previously.


The
 chairman
 comes
 to
 you,
 the
 owner


comes
 to
 you
 and
 says
 they
 want
 you
 to


do
 the
 job.
 Why
 did
 they
 want
 you
 to
 do


the
 job?


>> Because
 I
 didn't
 find
 anybody
 else
 in


the
 short
 in
 a
 short
 period
 of
 time.
 So,


we
 played
 Sunday
 and
 the
 next
 game
 was


on
 Wednesday.
 The
 idea
 was
 just
 to
 do


that
 game.
 So
 the
 the
 the
 the
 whole


story
 is
 that
 Ekat
 Gson
 um
 the
 manager


at
 that
 time
 he
 we
 we
 lost
 the
 game
 on


Sunday
 and
 we
 had
 a
 little
 camp
 a
 crisis


camp
 let
 me
 say
 because
 on
 Wednesday
 was


another
 very
 important
 game
 we
 had
 to


play.
 So
 he
 took
 us
 to
 a
 hotel
 that
 we


stay
 there
 have
 two
 good
 sessions
 and


then
 we
 go
 for
 this
 very
 very
 important


and
 maybe
 decisive
 game.
 And
 at
 night
 we


have
 a
 meeting.
 have
 a
 meeting
 with
 all


players
 and
 he
 said
 no
 gentlemen
 I
 want


I
 want
 only
 to
 ask
 one
 question
 I
 do
 you


still
 trust
 me
 are
 you
 still
 behind
 me
 I


don't
 want
 to
 answer
 now
 I
 order
 beer


for
 all
 of
 you
 I
 go
 out
 half
 an
 hour
 I


come
 back
 and
 you
 tell
 me


so
 he
 goes
 out
 where
 he
 just
 brings
 the


beer
 in
 we
 sit
 there
 look
 at
 each
 other


and
 think
 h


and
 discuss
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 I
 was
 not


captain
 that
 time
 yeah
 I
 was
 not
 the


captain
 so
 but
 then
 it's
 like
 at
 that


uh
 the
 decisions.
 No.


>> What?


>> Yeah.
 He
 asked.
 Why
 you
 ask?
 Yeah.
 No.


>> So,
 and
 it's
 like
 we
 are
 now
 we
 have
 a


discussion.
 Yeah.
 The
 majority
 some


people
 some
 players
 didn't
 speak
 but
 the


it
 was
 clear
 if
 you
 ask
 the
 answer
 is


no.


>> So,
 it's
 like
 that.
 I'm
 not
 captain
 but


the
 captain
 says
 global
 you
 tell
 him.


I
 tell
 him
 why.
 Oh,
 okay.
 But
 he
 comes


in.
 He
 comes
 in
 and
 and
 I
 said


actually
 no
 and
 he
 was
 shocked.
 He
 was


really
 shocked.
 I
 was
 like
 he
 didn't


expect
 it.
 It's
 more
 like
 a
 a
 little


thing
 to
 do
 and
 then
 we
 say
 yes
 we
 go


through
 that
 together
 something
 like


that.
 But
 we
 said
 no.


>> Why?


>> Because
 he
 was
 not
 the
 right
 person.
 He


was


>> because
 he
 we
 we
 played
 bad
 and
 we
 he


was


I
 love
 echard
 cson
 but
 that
 time
 for


that
 team
 was
 really
 he
 was
 just
 not
 the


right
 coach
 that
 can
 happen
 doesn't
 say


anything
 about
 you
 but
 we
 did
 we
 wrong


training
 wrong
 lineups
 wrong
 tactics


wrong
 everything.
 So
 that's
 how
 things


go
 bad
 in
 the
 wrong
 direction
 in
 that


time
 and
 we
 had
 no
 that
 time
 and
 we


didn't
 have
 to
 make
 the
 decision
 yeah


who
 can
 take
 over
 or
 whatever
 we
 just


could
 say
 no
 we
 we
 he we
 could
 have
 said


okay
 I
 will
 prove
 you
 wrong
 or
 whatever


but
 he
 ran
 out
 and
 said
 tomorrow
 morning


9:00
 training


>> okay
 and
 then
 he
 wanted
 to
 do
 a
 press


conference
 where
 he
 wanted
 to
 tell
 the


public
 that
 he
 kicks
 out
 all
 the


experienced
 players
 and
 starts
 now
 the


rest
 of
 the
 season
 and
 plays
 only
 the


young
 kid.
 Though
 I
 was
 one
 of
 the
 old


players,
 I
 was
 33.
 Um,
 but
 I
 didn't
 know


that
 that
 should
 happen.
 So,
 he
 called


the
 sporting
 director.
 We
 need
 a
 press


conference
 and
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 to
 them


and
 tell
 them
 we
 change
 everything.
 And


the
 sporting
 director
 says,
 "Yeah,
 we
 do


a
 press
 conference,
 but
 the
 subject
 will


be
 we
 sack
 you."


Okay.
 So,
 done.
 And
 now
 they
 didn't
 have


a
 coach.
 So
 and
 then
 they
 called
 me
 and


for
 that
 game
 can
 you
 do
 it
 and
 I
 said


yeah
 yeah
 I
 can
 do
 it
 and
 I
 did
 it
 and


we
 won
 the
 game
 and
 they
 didn't
 find
 a


manager
 so
 we
 had
 Sunday
 and
 other
 games


we
 the
 first
 game
 we
 won
 1
 nil
 the


second
 game
 we
 won
 3-1


yeah
 from
 the
 first
 seven
 games
 we
 won


six
 and
 Drew
 won
 so
 and
 we
 stayed
 in
 the


league
 pretty
 comfortably
 comfortably
 is


incredible
 we
 were
 a
 bunch
 of
 friends
 I


they
 were
 all
 my
 friends
 and
 I
 was
 their


boss
 they
 had
 to
 tell
 me
 that
 I
 changed


from
 now
 on
 in
 the
 coach's
 dressing


room.
 But
 what
 are
 you
 doing
 here?


Here's
 the
 coach's
 That's
 your
 office.


Okay.
 The
 first
 night
 we
 had
 a
 twin


room.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 and
 I
 got
 one
 more
 game
 to
 sleep


there
 with
 my
 friend
 you
 and
 Kney
 there


in
 in
 the
 same
 room.
 And
 then
 next
 day


they
 all
 told
 me,
 "Yeah,
 you
 have
 you


got
 your
 own
 room."
 Oh,
 okay.
 So,
 but


all
 the
 rest
 we
 were
 a
 real
 bunch
 of
 of


friends
 and
 they
 respected
 me
 from
 day


from
 the
 first
 second.


>> What
 was
 your
 approach
 going
 into
 that?


you
 you
 go
 from
 being
 a
 player
 to
 a


manager
 of
 these
 boys
 like
 what
 what


what's
 in
 your
 mind
 are
 you
 thinking
 I'm


just
 going
 to
 let
 them
 do
 whatever
 they


want
 to
 do
 I'm
 gonna


>> but
 we
 had
 wang
 very
 very
 the
 best
 the


best
 manager
 we
 all
 had
 when
 we
 were
 at


mines
 she
 was
 exceptional
 we
 at
 mines
 we


were
 a
 football
 team
 who
 lost
 all
 the


games
 when
 the
 other
 team
 had
 better


players


I
 think
 sounds
 normal
 but
 you
 know
 in


football
 is
 a
 way
 to
 to
 win
 games
 anyway


we
 never
 had
 that
 so
 comes
 in
 implements


four
 in
 the
 back,
 ball
 orientated


defending.
 We
 did
 nothing
 else
 than


that.
 And
 we
 changed
 overnight


into
 the
 one
 opponent
 nobody
 wanted
 to


play
 against.
 We
 were
 like
 machines.
 We


were
 like
 machine.
 We
 are
 not
 great


football.
 We
 were
 like
 machines.
 There


were
 games
 our
 goalkeeper
 didn't
 touch


the
 ball
 once.
 We
 were
 just
 defending.


It
 was
 new
 that
 time.
 So
 it
 was
 really


for
 all
 of
 them.
 That
 means
 we
 all


became
 believer
 in
 that.
 Then
 Wolfkang


left
 and
 none
 of
 the
 other
 coaches
 could


do
 that.
 None.
 There
 was
 no
 connection


to
 the
 coaches
 after
 Wolffrang.


>> Mhm.


>> So
 I
 was
 one
 of
 the
 players
 who


benefited
 massively
 from
 Wolffkang
 Frank


and
 now
 I
 arrived
 and
 the
 only
 thing
 I


did
 when
 I
 the
 two
 sessions
 I
 had
 were


both
 exactly
 about
 that
 44
 for
 two
 ball


orientated
 movements
 and
 we
 go
 for
 MSV


Ducebook
 that
 time
 there
 were
 third
 in


the
 table.
 We
 go
 for
 them
 like
 nobody


else.
 But
 I
 like
 these
 moments.
 I
 like


to
 find
 a
 reason
 why
 it
 makes
 sense
 that


why
 we
 give
 our
 absolute
 all
 in
 a
 moment


like
 this.
 Why
 we
 don't
 invest
 only
 the


the
 minimum?
 Why
 invest
 the
 maximum?


Why
 we
 would
 regret
 it
 if
 we
 don't
 do


it?
 How
 better
 life
 is
 if
 we
 do
 it?
 How


much
 more
 fun
 it
 is
 if
 we
 do
 it.
 I
 love


I
 love
 these
 moments
 and
 probably


something
 like
 that.
 I
 told
 them
 and


from
 that
 moment
 on
 nobody
 wanted
 to


play
 against
 us
 anymore.
 So
 like
 we
 were


like
 wow
 animals.
 It
 was
 great.
 It
 was
 a


fantastic
 time.
 Same
 team


um
 pretty
 much


uh
 changed
 overnight.


>> So
 you
 fixed
 the
 defensive
 situation,


the
 formation
 and
 you
 also
 told
 the


players
 in
 that
 dressing
 room
 a
 story
 of


why
 we
 had
 to
 give
 this
 give
 everything.


showed
 the
 they
 they
 wrote
 us
 off
 show


the
 outside
 world
 whatever
 you
 can
 do


most
 of
 the
 time
 it
 was
 real
 life
 but


that
 time
 so
 in
 my
 meetings
 later
 on
 I


never
 prepared
 in
 a
 way
 that
 I
 wrote


something
 down
 or
 whatever


our
 life
 was
 preparation
 what
 happened


during
 the
 week
 with
 us
 in
 the
 world
 but


that
 was
 preparation
 for
 meeting
 I
 never


thought
 long
 about
 it
 just
 remembered


that
 when
 I
 when
 I
 needed
 it
 we
 spoke
 I


I
 told
 the
 boys
 but
 that
 time
 they


needed
 one
 person
 to
 believe
 in
 them
 and


I
 did.
 It
 was
 not
 that
 I
 had
 to
 convince


myself.
 I
 have
 to
 tell
 them
 now
 before


that
 season
 I
 told
 in
 an
 interview
 this


is
 the
 best
 squad
 Mson
 ever
 had.
 It


would
 be
 really
 difficult
 for
 me
 to
 play


but
 good
 for
 us
 that
 the
 team
 is
 so
 good


and
 then
 we
 were
 in
 an


hopeless
 situation
 before
 I
 took
 over.


So
 I
 when
 I
 became
 the
 manager
 I
 was
 the


one
 who
 thought
 this
 team
 is
 incredible.


Nobody
 knows
 it
 yet
 but
 we
 will
 make


sure
 in
 a
 few
 weeks
 they
 will
 have
 a


sense
 at
 least.


>> How
 important
 did
 that
 prove
 to
 be
 this


idea
 of
 making
 sure
 that
 the
 players
 you


have
 throughout
 your
 career
 had
 belief


in
 themselves?


>> That's
 all
 it's
 all
 about
 that.
 It's
 not


football.
 It's
 life.


You
 had
 no
 when
 you
 started
 your
 podcast


you
 people
 probably
 told
 you
 well
 that


might
 be
 something
 for
 you
 but
 you
 were


not
 sure
 and
 then
 with
 each
 little
 thing


here
 and
 there.
 Oh
 how
 many
 people


listen
 to
 your
 first
 podcast?


>> Do
 you
 remember?
 No
 no no
 I
 think
 I
 read


it
 somewhere


>> 40


>> something
 around
 that
 was
 under
 100.


Yeah.


>> So
 it's
 a
 start.
 So
 it's
 a
 start
 and
 and


all
 the
 rest
 is
 if
 you
 want
 history
 and


that's
 always
 in
 life
 like
 that
 that


it's
 just
 give
 it
 a
 chance


of
 course
 it
 makes
 sense
 you
 believe
 in


yourself
 but
 not
 everybody
 can
 do
 that.


So
 if
 but
 then
 if
 you
 meet
 somebody
 who


helps
 you
 with
 that
 who
 has
 a


perspective
 who
 can
 see
 something
 in
 you


yeah
 then
 tell
 tell
 them
 why
 you
 should


keep
 it
 for
 yourself.
 Oh
 my
 god
 I
 think


he's
 a
 talent
 she's
 a
 talent
 whatever


she's
 good
 at
 that
 he's
 good
 at
 that.


Yeah.
 Why
 we
 don't
 tell
 each
 other?
 So


where's
 the
 problem?


>> Did
 someone
 do
 that
 for
 you?


Told
 you
 that
 you
 should
 believe
 in


yourself.
 They
 saw
 something
 in
 you.


>> Once
 I
 said
 I
 never
 struggled
 with


confidence,
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 why.
 That's


the
 truth.
 But
 it's
 true.
 I
 never


struggled
 with
 confidence.
 There's
 no


reason
 for
 it.
 My
 two
 best
 friends
 in


school
 were
 genius.
 And
 we
 sat
 together


doing
 exactly
 the
 reading
 the
 same


books.
 Did
 invested
 the
 same
 amount
 of


time.
 They
 had
 the
 best
 A
 levels
 in


school
 and
 I
 was
 far
 off
 that.
 So
 a


normal
 reaction
 would
 be


I'm
 a
 dump
 obviously


but
 I
 never
 thought
 that
 and
 I
 don't


really
 know
 why
 why
 why
 that
 happened.


So
 um
 I
 took
 it
 how
 it
 was.
 I
 thought
 oh


respect
 you
 you
 can
 remember
 all
 these


things.
 Crazy.
 I
 can't


>> but
 you
 had
 lots
 of
 players
 that


struggled
 with
 confidence.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 try
 to
 create
 a
 situation


to
 make
 sure
 that


the
 player
 if
 if
 they
 are
 not
 confident


yet
 they
 are
 confident
 but
 you
 know


there
 are
 moments
 when
 they
 lose
 it


confidence
 is
 like
 described
 it
 once
 as


a
 little
 flower
 and
 constantly
 somebody


steps
 on
 it
 it's
 like
 that
 oh
 and
 then


it's
 growing
 again
 and
 oh
 now
 we
 are


confident
 again
 stuff
 like
 this
 in


football
 it's
 really
 difficult
 because


it's
 like
 you
 cannot
 play
 without
 making


mistakes
 so
 if
 a
 mistake
 costs
 you


confident
 And


that's
 a
 re
 a
 real
 challenge.
 Um
 but


what
 I
 try
 to


if
 you
 would
 believe
 as
 much
 in
 yourself


as
 I
 do
 that
 will
 be
 a
 start.
 But
 as


long
 as
 you
 cannot
 do
 that
 just


trust
 me.
 So
 you
 are
 good
 because
 I


don't
 work
 with
 not
 with
 other
 I
 don't


waste
 time.
 I
 don't
 that's
 what
 and
 it's


true.
 I
 don't.
 So,
 I
 really
 I
 really
 see


something
 and
 if
 I
 see
 it,
 I'm
 patient


enough
 to
 work
 on
 it.
 Um
 much
 more


patient
 than
 the
 public
 wants
 me
 to
 be.


But
 of
 course,
 the
 the
 idea
 is
 that
 that


one
 day


I
 help
 you
 learn
 flying,
 but
 in
 the
 end,


you
 have
 to
 fly
 yourself.
 Obviously,
 I


cannot
 I
 cannot
 do
 that
 for
 you.
 That's


what
 it
 is
 football.
 You
 have
 to
 perform


alone.
 They
 cannot
 look
 at
 me.
 What


shall
 I
 do?
 And
 that's
 my
 job
 is
 to


prepare
 them
 as
 good
 to
 make
 it
 the


education
 the
 co
 the
 coaching
 as
 as
 wide


as
 they
 just
 pick
 for
 me.
 That's
 the


idea
 but
 not
 too
 much
 as
 well.
 It's
 yeah


it's
 obviously
 was
 a
 good
 time
 in
 my


life
 doing
 all
 these
 kind
 of
 things.
 I
 I


I
 worked
 with
 some
 of
 the
 best


footballers
 in
 the
 world.
 Um
 really
 good


time.
 Do
 you
 sometimes
 have
 to
 lie
 in


public
 to
 protect
 a
 player's
 confidence?


I
 was
 wonder
 I
 wonder
 this
 because
 you


see
 managers
 come
 out
 and
 say,
 "Oh,
 he


can't
 play
 because
 he's
 injured
 or


whatever."
 And
 they
 they
 say
 things,
 but


I
 wonder
 sometimes
 if
 managers
 are


protecting
 players


because
 they're
 struggling
 or


>> Yes,
 we
 protect
 players.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I


ever
 had
 to
 lie
 to
 be
 100%
 honest.
 I


don't
 know.
 But
 we
 protect
 players.


Super
 important.
 So
 for
 me,
 super


important.
 Um


he
 lacks
 confidence.
 That's
 in
 football


obvious
 you
 see
 that
 you
 run
 oneon-one


on
 a
 goalie
 and
 you
 don't
 make
 it
 you


can
 see
 it
 it's
 because
 you
 don't
 have


confidence
 that's
 that's
 how
 it
 is


there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 reasons
 it


can
 be
 wind
 weather
 ball
 opponent
 it's


there
 but
 you
 do
 it
 once
 you
 do
 it
 twice


three
 time
 yes
 that's
 like
 that's
 not


good
 for
 the
 confidence
 of
 nobody
 having


that
 in
 training
 you
 you
 have
 the
 job
 is


not
 to
 talk
 too
 much
 about
 to
 give
 him
 a


chance
 to
 get
 confidence
 back
 with
 the


things
 you
 do
 in
 training
 that
 it


doesn't
 last
 forever
 Well,
 um
 the
 one


thing
 you
 have
 to
 protect
 players
 from


is
 public


>> try
 to
 because
 they
 are
 ruthless
 in


moments.
 They
 don't
 care
 until
 something


happens
 or
 whatever.
 Supporters


sometimes
 I
 think
 we
 were
 really
 lucky


with
 that.
 We
 created
 that
 bond
 between


the
 supporters
 and
 the
 team
 that
 they


were
 not
 angry
 disappointed
 yes
 but
 not


angry
 in
 a
 way
 that
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 see


them
 anymore.
 So
 that
 helped.
 But
 of


course
 you
 have
 to
 protect
 them


sometimes.
 You
 have
 to
 protect
 them


sometimes
 from
 themselves
 as
 well.
 So


that's
 the
 job.


>> Did
 you
 have
 to
 involve
 yourself
 much


with
 social
 media
 usage
 of
 your
 team


members?
 And
 did
 you
 did
 you
 ever


consider
 someone's
 social
 media
 usage


when
 you
 were
 considering
 signing
 them


to
 join
 the
 club?
 Cuz
 I
 think
 this
 now


as
 a
 Manchester
 United
 fan,
 I
 think
 some


of
 when
 some
 of
 our
 players
 are
 posting


on
 social
 media
 little
 indirect
 messages


and
 little
 emojis
 and
 commenting
 things,


I
 just
 think,
 "Oh
 god,
 troublemaker.


We
 had
 situation
 that
 players


text
 us
 or
 or
 posted
 something
 at
 night


and
 deleted
 it,
 but
 I
 still
 got
 aware
 of


it.


>> Mhm.


>> So,
 not
 that
 I
 read
 it,
 but
 people
 tell


me,
 "Oh,
 last
 night
 this
 and
 that


happened
 when
 3:00."
 3:00.


Okay.
 What
 do
 you
 say?
 This
 and
 that.


Oh,
 what
 I
 do
 in
 these
 situations,
 even


deleted,
 I
 go
 in
 the
 dressing
 room
 and


they
 all
 last
 night
 this
 and
 this


happened.
 uh
 got
 deleted.
 I
 know
 what's


there,
 but
 maybe
 you
 want
 to
 tell


everybody.


>> You
 would
 ask
 him
 to
 say
 in
 front
 of


everybody.


>> Yeah,


>> that's
 nice.
 Eh,
 no.
 The
 the
 thing
 is
 I


didn't
 I
 don't
 go
 for
 him
 and
 tell
 him


how
 can
 you
 write
 that
 or
 whatever.
 So
 I


said,
 "Come
 on,
 I
 I
 somebody
 told
 me
 so


I
 know
 it."
 Ah,


not
 important
 really,
 but
 come
 on,
 tell


the
 whole
 team
 what
 he
 wanted
 to
 say.


and
 they
 start


it's
 not
 great
 in
 that
 situation
 that
 I


don't
 like
 to
 bring
 people
 in
 that
 but
 I


think
 that's
 a
 deserved
 punishment
 for


something
 like
 that
 but
 actually
 the


effect
 is
 nobody
 ever
 did
 it
 again


because
 nobody
 wants
 to
 be
 in
 that


situation
 in
 a
 dressing
 room
 sitting


there
 and
 be
 the
 one
 who
 has
 to
 explain


something
 he
 did
 last
 night
 or
 whatever


I
 discussed
 individual
 problems
 if
 it


was
 Okay.
 Quiet
 in
 front
 of
 the
 team
 if


it
 was
 important
 for
 the
 team.
 Yeah.


Come
 on.
 Explain
 why
 you
 did
 that.
 Why


you
 went
 out
 that
 long?
 What
 happened
 in


the
 last
 two
 hours?


>> This
 photo
 here
 is
 of
 things
 going
 well


for
 you.
 Yeah.
 Minds


>> before
 I
 had


that
 to
 get
 here.
 We
 we
 that's
 these
 are


tears.
 The
 tears
 the
 year
 and
 two
 years


before
 were
 not
 for
 the
 same
 reason.
 So


you
 probably
 know
 we
 didn't
 get
 promoted


for
 a
 point
 then
 a
 goal.
 First
 a
 goal.


First
 a
 point
 then
 a
 goal
 and
 then
 this


happened.
 That
 was
 the
 first
 day
 when
 it


really
 went
 well.


>> So
 this
 was
 the
 day
 that
 you
 were
 mind


promoted
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 their


history
 to
 the
 Bundesliga.


>> Yeah.
 But
 before
 winning
 that
 I
 I


learned
 how
 to
 lose.
 This
 is
 very


important.
 I
 would
 say
 I
 think
 that's


again
 to
 learn


even
 though
 you
 want
 to
 be
 as
 successful


as
 somehow
 possible


you
 have
 to
 accept
 that
 from
 time
 to


time
 you
 lose
 and
 then
 keep
 then
 when


you
 then
 keep
 going
 you
 have
 a
 good


chance
 if
 you
 learn
 from
 it
 a
 defeat
 is


a
 defeat
 if
 you
 don't
 learn
 from
 it
 if


you
 learn
 from
 it
 it's
 a
 very
 very


important
 information
 and
 obviously
 in


football
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 opportunities


to
 get
 did
 and
 opportunity
 to
 learn
 from


it.
 But
 this
 was
 the
 biggest
 relief


in
 my
 life.
 Not
 happiness
 that
 I
 was


just
 that's
 pure
 relief.
 The
 pressure


was
 mounting.
 I
 was
 crazy.
 Not
 only
 on


myself,
 nobody
 not
 from
 outside.
 I
 don't


know
 even
 know
 what
 the
 outside
 world


thought.
 But
 to
 make
 it
 happen
 that


year,


that
 was
 really
 special.
 But
 it
 took
 two


years
 of


coming
 close.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 dealing
 with
 the
 disappointment.


>> Yeah.


>> True.


>> When
 I
 spoke
 to
 Jamie
 Carrager,
 I
 I


asked
 Jamie
 Carrager
 actually
 this


earlier
 this
 morning.
 I
 said
 I
 said
 to


him,
 you
 know,
 what
 what
 was
 he
 curious


about
 with
 you?
 And
 this
 is
 actually


what
 he
 said.
 He
 said
 there
 were
 so
 many


near
 misses
 in
 your
 career,
 whether
 it


was
 in
 the
 Champions
 League
 or
 I


remember
 when
 you
 were
 headto-head
 with


Man
 City
 that
 in
 that
 season
 and
 you


were
 one
 point
 shy
 of
 winning
 the


league.
 And
 his
 question
 was,
 he's


fascinated
 with
 how
 you
 you
 were
 so
 good


at
 dealing
 with
 the
 disappointment
 of


near
 misses
 because
 sometimes
 near


misses
 can
 people.
 They
 can
 turn


them
 into
 a
 downward
 spiral.
 It
 can
 be


like
 the
 plant
 that
 got
 stood
 on.
 It
 can


crush
 someone's
 confidence.
 But
 it


appears
 through
 your
 career
 that
 near


misses
 ended
 up
 being
 positive
 forces


for
 you.


It's
 not
 that
 I
 knew
 that
 always
 but


what
 may
 we
 spoke
 about
 very
 early
 but


what
 made
 me
 the
 person
 I
 am
 these


people
 of
 course
 mom
 dad


my
 faith
 as
 well
 so
 and
 I
 I
 knew


always
 that
 I'm
 not
 here
 to
 get


everything
 I
 am
 here
 to
 give
 everything


so


that
 doesn't
 help
 in
 a
 moment
 when
 you


when
 you
 when
 you
 fail
 for
 a
 point


But
 in
 the
 general
 understanding
 as
 a


person
 of
 course
 it
 helps.
 So
 I'm
 not


surprised
 that
 I
 fail.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


think
 I
 don't
 see
 myself
 as
 a
 constant


winner
 in
 my
 in
 my
 mind.
 I
 see
 myself
 as


a
 constant
 tryer.
 So
 I
 don't
 know


constant
 winners
 but
 there
 might
 be
 some


out
 there.
 But
 I
 I
 just
 can't
 imagine
 a


world
 where
 it
 would
 be
 like
 that.
 all


all
 the
 people
 running
 around
 there,
 the


all
 the
 the
 happy
 people,
 they
 win
 all


the
 time.
 Nobody
 wins
 all
 the
 time.


Nobody
 does.
 So,
 it's
 all
 about
 dealing


with
 the
 things
 you
 want
 and
 not
 get
 and


then
 you
 want
 it
 more
 and
 or
 or
 not


anymore
 or
 whatever.
 So,
 the
 moments


were
 not
 great,
 but
 I
 learned
 it
 here.


Doing
 it
 that
 day
 changed


the
 the
 destiny
 of
 the
 club
 of
 M.
 That's


how
 it
 is.
 My
 destiny,
 the
 players


destiny
 changed
 everything.
 So,
 we


wanted
 it
 that
 hard,
 but
 we
 learned


before
 we
 have
 to
 try
 harder.
 And
 that's


what
 I
 always
 took.
 If
 you
 don't
 get
 the


result
 you
 want,


try
 again
 and
 try
 harder.


>> It
 was
 Christian
 that
 gave
 you
 that
 job,


wasn't
 it?


>> Yeah.
 Mr.
 Hyel.


>> Christian
 H
 Highle.
 I
 um
 I
 spoke
 to


Christian
 Hyel.


He
 made
 a


>> His
 English
 is
 very
 funny,
 isn't
 it?


>> Yeah.
 I've
 had
 I've
 had
 to
 I'm
 going
 to


translate
 it
 for
 the
 viewers,
 but
 I'm


going
 to
 actually
 play
 what
 he
 said
 to


you
 in
 in
 German.


>> Oh,
 of
 course.


>> So
 you
 can
 hear
 it.


>> Here
 we
 go.


>> Global.


>> Yes,
 dear
 Global.
 We've
 known
 each
 other


for
 exactly
 35
 years
 now.
 First,
 we
 were


both
 players.
 Then
 you
 subsequently


became
 my
 esteemed
 coach.
 It
 all
 started


in
 Mitz.
 You
 changed
 an
 entire
 club.
 You


changed
 an
 entire
 city.
 Back
 then,
 we


were
 promoted
 to
 the
 Bundesliga


together.
 And
 today,
 Mines
 has
 been
 in


the
 Bundesliga
 for
 over
 25
 years.
 Back


then,
 that
 was
 actually
 unimaginable.


You
 go
 to
 Dortmund,
 change
 your
 club,


change
 an
 entire
 city,
 and
 win
 every


title
 there
 is
 to
 win.
 You
 move
 to


Liverpool
 and
 the
 same
 thing
 happens
 for


the
 third
 time.
 You
 change
 your
 club,


you
 change
 your
 city.
 I
 don't
 think
 any


coach
 before
 you
 has
 ever
 achieved
 that.


And
 I'm
 always
 asked,
 "What
 makes
 Jurgen


Klopp
 special?"
 To
 this
 day,
 he
 has


simply
 remained
 a
 genuine
 person,
 always


authentic,
 which
 is
 incredibly


important.
 apart
 from
 the
 fact
 that
 you


are
 of
 course
 an
 outstanding
 expert.
 I


hope
 we'll
 see
 each
 other
 again
 soon
 on


our
 little
 shared
 island
 in
 Mayorca.
 Um,


and
 have
 a
 great
 day
 and
 lots
 of
 fun


with
 your
 podcast.


>> Wow.


>> You
 know,


>> yeah,


I
 told
 you


>> you
 changed
 a
 club.
 You
 changed
 the


city.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 did
 that
 over
 and
 over
 and
 over


again.
 You
 went
 on
 and
 did
 that
 again
 at


Dortmund.
 um
 winning
 a
 huge
 range
 of


awards
 there
 at
 a
 time
 when
 they
 were


weren't
 considered
 to
 be
 hopeful
 and


then
 you
 went
 off
 to
 Liverpool
 and
 did


the
 same.
 And
 as
 you
 I
 was
 reading
 about


how
 when
 you
 traveled
 to
 Liverpool
 there


was
 30,000
 Liverpool
 fans
 watching
 your


plane
 fly
 across


>> um
 the
 channel
 to
 Liverpool
 because


they're
 all
 very
 excited.
 And
 you


arrived
 at
 a
 time
 when
 they
 were
 in
 a
 a


period
 of
 dysfunction,
 kind
 of
 similar


to
 where
 Manchester
 United
 are
 now,
 I


guess.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 you
 managed
 to
 bring
 them
 up
 from


being
 a
 team
 that
 were
 dysfunctional,


hadn't
 won.
 There
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 pessimism


around
 the
 club.
 I
 think
 as
 a
 Man
 United


fan,
 I
 was
 hoping
 and
 wondering
 that
 if


Liverpool
 would
 ever
 come
 back,
 I
 was


hoping
 they
 would
 never
 come
 back
 again,


but
 you
 brought
 them
 back
 annoyingly.


When
 you
 when
 you
 arrived
 at
 Liverpool


that
 day,
 you
 said
 in
 that
 press


conference
 that
 you're
 the
 normal
 one.
 I


remember
 that.


What
 what
 did
 you
 observe
 when
 you


arrived?
 What
 was
 the
 culture?
 What
 was


the
 feeling?
 And
 what
 was
 your
 first


thought
 about
 what
 you
 had
 to
 do
 to
 to


bring
 that
 club
 back
 to
 its
 glory?


>> The
 feeling
 I
 got
 I
 had
 roughly
 a
 week


to
 to
 think
 about
 everything
 from
 the


from
 the
 first
 call
 to
 the
 signature.
 I


think


>> did
 you
 have
 other
 offers
 from
 other


clubs?


>> Oh,
 in
 that
 moment
 not.
 But
 in
 the


summer
 I
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 offers
 like
 before


when
 I
 when
 I
 finished
 at
 at
 Dortmund.


Um
 but
 in
 that
 moment
 it
 was
 just


Liverpool
 but
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 destiny


because
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 it
 was
 not
 we


were
 on
 a
 family
 holiday
 in
 Lisa
 with


the
 with
 the
 two
 boys
 and
 I
 sitting


there
 phone
 goes
 my
 agent
 why
 is
 he


calling
 boys
 look
 at
 my
 face
 I
 say


Liverpool


>> and
 the
 both
 yes
 the
 boys


>> yeah
 and
 when
 I
 looks
 what
 what
 is
 and


she
 didn't
 see
 my
 lips
 when
 when
 I
 spoke


what
 and
 realized
 oh
 god
 we
 start
 again


before
 she
 knew
 we
 will
 we
 will
 um
 go
 to


Liverpool.


>> Why
 did
 your
 boys
 want


>> Come
 on.
 If
 you
 are
 not
 a
 Man
 United


fan,
 you
 know
 what
 what
 Liverpool
 means


for
 two
 people.
 Um
 and
 they
 they
 they


Yeah,
 they
 loved
 it
 and
 we
 we
 fell


instantly
 in
 love
 with
 that
 club.
 So


>> did
 did
 Manchester
 United
 ever
 call?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 spoke
 to
 them.


So
 in
 the
 year
 when
 Alex
 retired,
 they


they
 spoke
 to
 me.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Of


course
 they
 were
 interested
 at
 one


point.
 So
 I
 was
 that
 time
 I
 would
 have


been
 interested.
 I
 was
 a
 young
 I
 had
 a


sensational
 team
 at
 Dortmund.
 My
 god.
 So


somebody
 they
 probably
 thought
 my
 what


is
 he
 doing
 there?
 Um
 later
 on
 I
 heard


that
 my
 players
 Hando,
 Adam
 Lana,
 James


Melon.
 So
 that
 they
 flew
 to
 to
 to
 Real


Madrid
 when
 we
 played
 the
 semi-final
 in


the
 Champions
 League
 to
 watch
 us.
 I


wanted
 to
 see
 what
 is
 Dortmund
 doing.
 My


god,
 what
 a
 football
 that
 is.
 I
 I
 mean,


you
 can
 get
 bigger
 compliments.
 It's


really
 It's
 really
 good.


>> I
 want
 to
 know
 why
 Manchester
 United


didn't


>> No,
 no,
 no,
 no.
 They
 they
 tried.
 I
 I
 It


was
 wrong
 time,
 wrong
 moment
 for
 me.
 I
 I


was
 in
 had
 a
 contract
 at
 Dortmund.
 I


wouldn't
 have
 left.
 Not
 really
 for
 for


for
 nobody
 in
 that
 time.
 They
 just


needed
 a
 manager,
 but
 the
 manager
 they


wanted
 in
 that
 case.
 Now,
 it
 was
 one
 of


a
 few
 options,
 I
 think.
 Um


>> So,
 it
 was
 you
 that
 turned
 down


Manchester
 United,
 not
 Manchester
 United


turning
 you
 down.


>> Yeah.
 That
 way.
 So
 I
 Yeah.
 So


>> we
 need
 someone
 else
 on
 negotiations.
 We


need


>> Yeah.
 No,
 no,
 no.
 He's
 not
 there


anymore.
 The
 guy
 who
 negotiated
 that.
 So


um
 there
 are
 now
 other
 people
 in
 charge.


It's
 long
 ago.
 Long
 ago.
 So


>> why
 why
 would
 a
 guy
 like
 Manchester


United's
 often
 known
 as
 the
 biggest
 club


in
 the
 world?
 Why
 wouldn't
 you
 take
 that


job?
 Why
 didn't
 you
 take
 that
 job?


>> Manchester
 United,
 the
 great
 Manchester


United.


>> This
 is
 typical.
 We
 are
 now
 not
 in


private
 in
 a
 private
 space.
 So
 there
 are


some
 reasons
 what
 the
 people
 in
 that


conversation
 told
 me
 which
 I
 didn't


like.


>> Oh
 really?


>> So
 United
 was
 that
 big.
 We
 get
 all
 the


players
 we
 want.
 We
 are
 like
 we
 can
 this


we
 get
 him.
 We
 get
 him.
 We
 get
 him.
 We


get
 him.
 And
 I
 was
 sitting
 there.


So
 I
 it
 was
 not
 my
 project.
 It
 didn't


feel
 like
 my
 it
 was
 a
 wrong
 time
 but
 on


top
 of
 that
 it
 was
 not
 my
 project.
 What


you


>> I
 didn't
 I
 didn't
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 bring


back
 I
 don't
 know
 Pogba
 Paul
 is
 a


sensational
 player
 my
 god
 but
 these


things
 don't
 work
 usually
 but
 these
 kind


of
 things
 or
 Cristiano
 god
 we
 all
 know


that
 he's
 the
 best
 player
 or
 together


with
 Messi
 the
 best
 player
 in
 the
 world


so
 but
 bringing
 back
 never
 helps
 in
 that


time
 in
 2013
 it
 was
 obviously
 not
 about


Cristiano
 maybe
 about
 Paulo
 I'm
 not
 even


sure
 when
 don't
 get
 the
 numbers
 together


but
 it
 was
 just
 the
 idea
 is
 we
 bring
 the


best
 players
 together
 and
 then
 let's
 go.


>> It
 wasn't
 about
 the
 football.
 It
 was


>> No,
 not
 at
 all.
 And
 I
 sat
 there
 and
 was


like,
 "Nah,
 I'm
 not
 sure.
 That's
 not
 for


me."
 So,
 and
 then
 the
 pure


pure
 football
 project


comes
 up
 with
 with
 Liverpool
 and
 the


sensational
 talk
 to
 to
 Mike
 Gordon


should
 that's
 really
 important
 as
 well


like
 he
 was
 the
 is
 the
 owner.
 I
 know


John
 and
 Tom
 of
 course
 as
 well,
 but
 Mike


was
 responsible
 for
 us.
 I
 wanted
 after


the
 talk
 I
 want
 to
 be
 his
 friend.
 He's


such
 a
 good
 guy.
 So
 that's
 how
 it


started
 and
 in
 the
 end
 yeah
 was
 pretty


special.
 Yeah,
 I
 find
 this
 fascinating


because
 as
 a
 Manchester
 United
 fan,
 I
 I


observed
 from
 the
 moment
 Sir
 Alex


Ferguson
 left,
 we
 adopted
 a
 very


different
 approach
 and
 we
 brought
 in
 all


these
 massive
 name
 players,
 Di
 Maria,


Falcao,
 Ibra,
 you
 know,
 Ibrahimovic,


Pogba,
 Ronaldo
 and
 we
 we
 failed
 and
 it


it
 taught
 me
 something
 as
 an


entrepreneur
 about
 what
 matters
 more
 and


I
 actually
 when
 I
 read
 through
 your


philosophy,
 it's
 quite
 clear
 in
 your


philosophy
 that
 you
 you
 prefer
 attitude


ude
 and
 character
 versus
 how
 many


Instagram
 followers
 you've
 got
 and
 what


you've
 done
 in
 the
 past.


>> Yeah,
 of
 course.


>> And
 I
 wanted
 to
 get
 your
 take
 on
 why
 you


think
 the
 last
 This
 is
 very
 selfish
 of


me.
 The
 last
 sort
 of
 15
 years
 at


Manchester
 United
 haven't
 worked
 out
 as


an
 objective
 observer.


>> I
 want
 to
 I
 need
 to
 know
 you
 you
 can't


no
 you
 you're
 a
 man
 that
 was
 able
 to


take
 teams
 and
 make
 them
 successful
 and


we
 are
 currently


>> underdogs
 in
 many
 regards
 because
 of
 the


last
 15
 years.
 What
 is
 it
 that
 we've


missed
 in
 that
 time?
 What
 have
 we


overlooked
 in
 your
 view?


>> I
 know
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 hear
 that.


>> You
 have
 a
 hypothesis,
 though.


>> I
 didn't
 think
 a
 second


since
 I
 joined
 Liverpool
 about
 what
 Man


United
 did,
 right
 or
 wrong.
 I
 just


didn't.
 So,
 it's
 like
 I
 buy
 into
 a


situation.
 So
 um
 I
 went
 to
 Liverpool
 and


that
 moment
 you
 became
 our
 opponent.
 Not


my
 enemy
 but
 an
 a
 very
 important


opponent,
 one
 who
 is
 much
 more
 fun
 to


beat
 than
 maybe
 and
 and
 and
 like
 others


like
 with
 Everton.
 I
 know
 so
 many


Everton
 fans
 in
 Liverpool.
 We
 lived


there
 for
 9
 years.
 So
 I
 know
 so
 many


people
 have
 great
 people.
 Yeah.
 So


absolutely.
 But
 then
 you
 go
 to
 the
 game


and
 think,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 that's
 something


different."
 Not
 I
 make
 that
 up.
 It's


like
 that.
 Um
 but
 I
 really
 didn't
 think


but
 but
 always
 in
 football
 is
 like
 this.


And
 again
 like
 in
 life
 you
 have
 a


problem
 and
 you
 only
 try
 to
 find
 a


solution
 for
 now
 knowing


you
 have
 two
 days
 later
 another
 problem


you
 know
 it
 but
 it's
 just
 for
 now
 just


find
 a
 solution
 for
 that
 problem
 there's


no
 mid
 no
 long
 term
 okay
 we
 have
 to
 deal


with
 that
 for
 another
 day
 or
 two
 and


then
 we
 can
 sort
 it
 and
 that
 means
 in
 in


our
 sense
 we
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 that
 for


a
 year
 or
 two
 at
 United
 and
 then
 we
 can


make
 a
 big
 step
 then
 this
 in
 our
 case


and
 football
 case
 contracts
 are
 running


out,
 player
 goes
 anyway,
 we
 can
 sell


him,
 we
 can
 do
 this,
 but
 because
 you're


in
 such
 a
 rush
 all
 the
 time
 just
 because


you
 want
 to
 or
 have
 to
 win
 the
 next
 game


a
 little
 bit
 like
 that
 being
 now
 in
 the


situation
 probably
 United
 in
 the
 years


when
 they
 were
 not
 happy
 they
 would
 buy


the
 time
 from
 that
 time
 becoming
 second


and
 nobody
 was
 really
 happy
 there
 and


they
 think
 oh
 remember
 that
 in
 that
 time


second
 was
 not
 good
 enough
 and
 now
 you


are
 not
 even
 close
 to
 that
 but
 that's


not
 a
 Man
 United
 story
 for
 it's
 just
 a


football
 story.
 It's
 always
 like
 that
 in


the
 foot
 in
 the
 world
 of
 football.
 You


win,
 you're
 the
 greatest.
 You
 lose,
 you


know
 nothing
 about
 the
 game.
 You
 draw,


you're
 boring.
 So
 there's
 not
 that


you're
 constant.
 And
 it's
 only
 about


your
 own
 idea
 what
 you
 really
 want
 to
 do


and
 where
 you
 want
 to
 go.
 And
 everything


in
 life
 is
 about
 development.
 We
 today


you
 were
 not
 the
 same
 10
 years
 ago.
 I


was
 not
 the
 same
 10
 years
 ago.
 So
 it


means
 the
 time
 between
 then
 and
 now


counts.
 So
 if
 it
 counts
 for
 me
 the
 next


10
 years
 do
 the
 same.
 So
 it's
 important


what
 I
 do.
 It's
 important
 what
 I
 see
 in


a
 year
 two
 three.
 So
 I
 have
 to
 plan
 my


own
 life
 mid
 and
 long
 term
 as
 much
 as
 I


can
 do
 that.
 And
 especially
 the
 destiny


and
 and
 the
 future
 of
 a
 football
 club


a
 player
 can
 score
 a
 goal
 can
 score
 five


goals
 will
 never
 sort
 the
 problems
 if


you
 have


>> real
 problems.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 the


United
 problems
 but
 that
 Liverpool
 was


the
 same.
 It's
 not
 about
 that
 on
 the
 day


when
 we
 when
 we
 lost
 sold
 Phil
 Coutinho.


That
 was
 not
 the
 day
 when
 I
 thought


oh
 good
 that
 we
 have
 the
 money.
 I
 lost


the
 player
 I
 wanted
 to
 work
 with
 for
 the


next
 10
 years
 if
 you
 want.
 It
 was
 not


that
 that
 I
 thought
 and
 we
 can
 invest


it.
 Yeah
 we
 invested
 it
 smartly.
 That's


true.
 But
 it's
 not
 that
 we
 found
 a


player
 for
 the
 position
 and
 sorted
 that.


That's
 we
 had
 to
 sort
 differently
 but
 we


found
 two
 really
 solid
 solid
 and


becoming
 world
 class
 players
 with


Allison
 and
 Fandai
 that
 was
 for
 the


future
 to
 go
 from
 there
 and
 now
 that's


the
 difference
 I
 think


>> I've
 had
 so
 many
 founders
 speak
 to
 me


and
 say
 why
 didn't
 this
 particular
 ad


that
 I
 ran
 on
 this
 platform
 work
 for
 me


maybe
 the
 copy
 wasn't
 good
 the
 creative


wasn't
 strong
 but
 usually
 the
 problem
 is


they're
 not
 having
 the
 right


conversation
 because
 that
 ad
 never


reached
 the
 right
 person
 and
 if
 you're


in
 B2B
 marketing
 that
 is
 much
 of
 the


name.
 And
 this
 is
 where
 LinkedIn
 ads


solves
 that
 problem
 for
 you.
 Their


targeting
 is
 ridiculously
 specific.
 You


can
 target
 by
 job
 title,
 seniority,


company
 size,
 industry,
 and
 even


someone's
 skill
 set.
 And
 their
 network


includes
 over
 a
 billion
 professionals,


about
 130
 million
 of
 them
 are
 decision


makers.
 So,
 when
 you
 use
 LinkedIn
 ads,


you're
 putting
 your
 brand
 in
 front
 of


the
 right
 people.
 And
 LinkedIn
 ads
 also


drive
 the
 highest
 B2B
 return
 on
 ad
 spend


across
 all
 ad
 networks
 in
 my
 experience.


If
 you
 want
 to
 give
 them
 a
 try,
 head


over
 to
 linkedin.com/diary.


And
 when
 you
 spend
 $250
 on
 your
 first


LinkedIn
 ads
 campaign,
 you'll
 get
 an


extra
 $250
 credit
 from
 me
 for
 the
 next


one.
 That's

 Do
 any
 of


you
 remember
 a
 conversation
 I
 had
 on


this
 podcast
 with
 anthropologist
 Daniel


Lieberman?
 It
 was
 one
 of
 our
 most
 viewed


conversations
 of
 all
 time.
 And
 the
 most


replayed
 moment
 in
 that
 conversation
 was


when
 I
 talked
 about
 this
 product.
 These


are
 what
 I
 call
 barefoot
 shoes
 by
 Vivo


Barefoot,
 which
 have
 significantly


reduced
 support,
 which
 gives
 my
 feet
 the


opportunity
 that
 they
 desperately
 want


to
 need
 to
 strengthen.
 We're
 living
 in
 a


comfort
 crisis
 and
 that
 at
 all
 times
 in


our
 lives,
 we're
 making
 this
 trade
 of


whether
 to
 have
 more
 comfort
 now
 and


therefore
 more
 discomfort
 in
 the
 future


or
 a
 little
 bit
 less
 comfort
 now,
 but
 to


be
 stronger
 and
 healthier
 in
 the
 future.


And
 research
 from
 Liverpool
 University


has
 backed
 this
 up.
 They've
 shown
 that


wearing
 Vivo
 Barefoot
 shoes
 for
 6
 months


can
 increase
 foot
 strength
 by
 up
 to
 60%.


So
 if
 you
 want
 to
 start
 strengthening


your
 feet
 and
 your
 body,
 visit


vivarefoot.com/stephven

 What


I
 love
 about
 football
 is
 the
 analogies


to
 the
 world
 I'm
 in,
 which
 is
 the
 world


of
 business,
 where
 you
 can
 watch
 a
 team


like
 we're
 seeing,
 I
 think,
 Crystal


Palace
 at
 the
 moment,
 who
 objectively


don't
 have
 maybe
 the
 best
 players
 in
 the


world.
 They
 don't
 have
 the
 most
 money.


>> Bournemouth
 as
 well.


>> Bournemouth
 as
 well.
 Yeah.
 But
 they're


doing
 something
 which
 is
 creating
 this


magic
 and
 it's
 this
 wonderful
 narrative


of
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 have
 the
 most


talent
 or
 resources
 to
 have
 the
 best


outcome.
 So
 what
 is
 that
 gap
 between


like
 and
 that's
 There
 must
 be
 something.


Now
 look,
 it's
 it's
 a
 situation
 the


moment
 and
 the
 situation
 with
 Crystal


Palace
 and
 Bournemouth
 is
 massively


different
 to
 the
 situation
 for
 United.


If
 if
 Bournemouth
 wins
 a
 game
 one
 nil


and
 doesn't
 perform
 particularly
 well,


you
 take
 it
 and
 you
 go
 on.
 I'm
 not
 sure


you
 would
 really
 find
 an
 article
 in
 in


in
 the
 newspaper
 about
 it
 just
 winning


and
 go
 but
 United
 is
 United
 each
 step
 is


under
 the
 under
 focus
 and
 what
 oh
 he


didn't
 they
 won
 but
 he
 didn't
 play


great.
 So
 they
 they
 win
 a
 game
 and
 then


somebody
 doesn't
 perform
 well.
 So
 pick


him
 out
 and
 go
 for
 him
 full
 throttle.


You
 think,
 "Wow."
 Right?
 So
 the
 coach


has
 to
 pick
 him
 up
 again.
 No,
 no,
 it's


all
 right.
 Stuff
 like
 this.
 And
 the
 next


one
 and
 the
 different
 completely


different
 situations.
 The
 only
 problem


you
 have
 now


in
 the
 time
 you
 try
 to
 sort
 your


problems,


all
 the
 other
 clubs
 improve
 their


situations.


>> Mhm.


>> So
 Liverpool
 has
 an
 incredible
 squad.


Yes.
 Are
 they
 100%
 happy
 right
 now
 with


the
 three
 defeats?
 No,
 probably
 not.
 But


incredible
 squad.
 Arsenal,
 incredible


squad.
 City
 city,
 I
 mean,
 and
 they
 want


to
 strike
 back.
 There's
 already
 three


clubs.
 Chelsea.


>> Mhm.


>> Huh.
 They
 in
 that
 time
 when
 everybody


thought,
 do
 they
 have
 an
 overview
 about


their
 transfer
 market?
 Do
 they
 know
 who


they
 own
 and
 who
 they
 loan
 and
 stuff


like
 this?
 Obviously,
 somehow
 it
 pays


off.
 So,
 they
 have
 already
 five
 clubs.


They
 are
 above
 you.
 Are
 you
 happy
 with


position
 six?
 No.
 Mhm.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 and
 here's
 the
 problem.
 Should
 you


be
 happy
 theoretically
 with
 position


six?
 Maybe
 this
 year
 and
 build
 on
 that.


So,
 find
 um
 find
 a
 reason.
 Find
 a
 reason


to
 enjoy
 the
 situation
 again.
 Find
 a


reason
 to
 enjoy
 a
 a
 one
 nil
 victory,


two-nil
 victory
 at
 home,
 whoever
 against


whoever.
 Southampton.
 Try
 to
 enjoy
 that.


Really
 be
 happy.
 go
 home
 and
 not


listening
 to
 others
 who
 tell
 you
 then.


But
 Southampton,
 that's
 what
 we
 had


years
 ago
 when
 we
 decided
 after
 a
 draw


against
 West
 Brom


to
 say
 thank
 you
 to
 the
 supporters.
 We


stand
 in
 front
 of
 the
 cop
 and
 hold
 his


other
 hand
 and
 and
 said
 thank
 you.
 And


then
 the
 press
 conference
 and
 Tony
 P
 is


uh
 uh
 what
 a
 what
 the
 world
 we
 are


living
 in
 when
 Liverpool
 with
 the
 money


they
 spend
 celebrated
 point
 against
 West


Brom.


Oh


thank
 you.
 Um
 so
 but
 it's
 it's
 it's
 your


choice
 how
 you
 grow
 together
 again.
 And


I
 think
 after
 all
 the
 years
 now
 without


a
 lot
 of
 good
 football
 they
 need
 to
 find


a
 way
 to
 grow
 together
 again.


>> I
 fully
 believe
 in
 Reuben
 Amarim.
 Um,
 I


think
 he's
 he's
 a
 man
 that's
 focused
 on


culture.
 And
 I
 I
 like
 how
 honest
 he
 is


as
 well.
 And
 I
 think
 with
 the
 team
 that


they
 have
 around
 them
 with
 people
 like


Jason
 Wilcox
 and
 Inos
 who
 I've
 met
 um


and
 Colette
 and
 all
 the
 others
 that
 are


there,
 I
 think
 we're
 we've
 never
 been
 in


a
 better
 place.
 I
 personally
 feel
 like


that
 because
 I
 just
 think
 they're
 aiming


for
 more
 long-term
 things.
 They're


aiming
 at
 long
 term.


>> The
 only
 problem
 is
 you
 have
 no
 clue


about
 football,
 but
 besides
 that,


>> that's
 a
 small
 problem.


>> So,
 yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Good
 on
 you.
 Good
 on
 you.


>> I
 have
 faith.


>> That's
 great.


>> Yeah.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 all
 my
 friends
 do,


but
 but
 I
 certainly
 do.
 And
 the
 only


reason
 I
 have
 faith
 is
 because
 I
 see
 the


club
 aiming
 at
 more
 long-term
 things
 now


>> and
 not
 buying


>> that's
 what
 you
 have
 to
 do.


>> Players
 because
 they
 have
 loads
 of


Instagram
 followers.
 Yeah.


>> When
 you
 got
 that
 phone
 call
 from


Liverpool
 and
 they
 asked
 you
 to
 come
 and


join,
 you
 said,
 "Well,
 the
 reason
 you


chose
 Liverpool
 is
 cuz
 they
 felt
 like
 a


football
 project
 versus
 Manchester


United
 who
 seem
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 more
 less


football
 oriented,


>> but
 but
 it's
 not
 the
 same
 year.
 Two


years
 two
 years
 before.


>> I'm
 wondering


what
 is
 it
 about
 their
 proposal
 that


made
 you
 think
 it
 was
 a
 football


project?"


>> Oh,
 the
 situation.
 I
 knew
 the
 club,
 I


knew
 the
 team.
 So
 if
 you
 look
 at
 um
 on


top
 of
 that
 I
 didn't
 think
 it
 that
 way


but
 when
 Alex
 left
 it
 was
 they
 became


champion
 in
 his
 last
 year
 but
 it
 was
 not


that
 the
 team
 was
 the
 one
 you
 build
 a


future
 on.
 So
 that's
 how
 it
 is
 when
 you


come
 in
 as
 you
 it's
 is
 a
 bit
 built
 to


fail
 if
 you
 want
 it
 but
 I
 didn't
 see
 it


that
 way
 in
 that
 time
 it
 was
 had
 other


reasons
 but
 if
 I
 would
 have
 thought


longer
 about
 it
 probably


>> yeah
 so
 David
 Moyes
 fantastic
 fantastic


manager
 um
 proves
 every
 year
 um
 couldn't


do
 the
 job
 and
 since
 then
 it's
 a
 bit
 of


a
 problem
 so
 a
 new
 team
 needs
 time
 he


was
 stitched
 up
 he
 was


>> so
 needs
 time
 so
 Liverpool
 the
 team
 as
 I


I
 said
 when
 I
 him.
 Um,
 nobody
 likes
 the


team.
 Not
 even
 the
 team
 likes
 the
 team.


Um,
 I
 like
 the
 team.
 Do
 I
 like
 the
 team?


I
 knew
 the
 players.
 I
 thought
 when
 Bobby


Faminia
 moved
 there,
 I
 said,
 "Oh,
 that's


a
 smart
 that's
 a
 smart
 transfer."
 I


know.
 I
 knew
 Christian
 Benteke.
 I
 love


Debri.
 I
 knew
 John
 Hennison.
 I
 knew
 Adam


L.
 I
 know
 many
 plenty
 players
 and
 heard


only
 kind
 of
 good
 enough
 thought,
 well,


let's
 see.
 So,
 I
 like
 the
 team.
 So,


that's
 a
 football
 team,
 proper
 football,


super
 attitude.
 I
 mean
 just
 on
 day
 one
 I


could
 have
 um
 um
 played
 Hendo
 Millie
 and


Adam
 together
 in
 midfield.
 Maybe
 I
 did.


I
 don't
 even
 know
 my
 first
 lineup.
 But


this
 it's
 a
 proper
 engine
 room.
 It's


smart
 players.
 It's
 people
 who
 really


want
 to
 want
 to
 um
 perform,
 want
 to
 work


hard
 and
 all
 these
 kind
 of
 things.
 And


what
 do
 you
 need
 for
 a
 start?
 I
 knew


Liverpool
 was
 not
 the
 same
 club
 than


they
 were
 before.
 It's
 not
 that
 I
 went


into
 the
 shiny
 room.
 I
 played
 there
 a


year
 before
 with
 Dortmund
 in
 a
 summer
 in


the
 preseason
 and
 I
 was


massively
 disappointed
 about
 the


dressing
 rooms
 where
 I
 remember
 you
 have


this
 pictures
 in
 your
 mind
 you
 think
 oh


my
 god
 it's
 envy


and
 you
 walk
 in
 and
 make
 two
 steps
 into


the
 dressing
 room
 and
 you
 run
 against


the
 wall
 and
 you
 think


kidding
 is
 that
 all
 where's
 the
 rest
 so


English
 dressing
 rooms
 really
 really


small
 in
 the
 old
 stadiums
 they
 think
 oh


my
 god
 how
 can
 we
 bring
 it.
 It
 was
 built


for
 11
 players
 and
 now
 we
 come
 here
 with


30.
 So
 people
 in
 that
 room
 doesn't
 help.


So
 I
 I
 knew
 about
 the
 history.
 I
 knew


that
 nobody's
 happy.
 I
 knew
 that
 I
 like


the
 team.


Um
 that's
 a
 good
 start.


>> And
 did
 they
 tell
 you
 that
 they
 were


going
 to
 develop
 the
 the
 ground
 the


stadium?
 Did
 they
 make
 any
 promises
 to


your
 assurances?
 Did
 they
 tell
 you


you're
 going to
 get


>> They
 didn't
 we
 didn't
 really
 speak
 about


that
 in
 the
 first
 conversation.
 That's


that's
 nothing
 I
 need
 to
 talk
 about
 in


in
 this
 kind
 of
 conversation.
 I
 know
 my


the
 job
 I
 had
 in
 that
 moment
 was
 just
 to


improve
 the
 football
 team
 not
 the
 club


that
 I
 was
 involved
 in
 all
 the
 other


stuff
 happened
 with
 time
 with
 time
 just


that
 be
 I
 realize
 this
 is
 my


responsibility
 now
 as
 well
 um
 you
 never


know
 I
 don't
 plan
 seven
 8
 n
 years
 spells


in
 a
 club
 it
 just
 happens
 it's
 like
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 could
 sack
 me


but
 I
 know
 could
 happen
 so
 I
 plan
 from
 a


specific
 moment
 on
 when
 I
 sorted
 the


first
 few
 things
 then
 I
 plan
 mid
 and


long
 term
 or
 always
 did
 knowing
 it
 might


not
 be
 for
 me
 but
 um
 I
 was
 I
 was
 never


worried
 about
 that
 too
 much.


>> What
 was
 the
 first
 first
 couple
 of


things
 you
 thought
 you
 had
 to
 change
 to


get
 them
 winning
 and
 to
 get
 the
 the


confidence
 back
 and
 to
 ultimately
 bring


the
 city
 behind
 you?
 Was
 there
 anything


you
 thought
 okay
 the
 first
 thing
 I'm


going
 to
 have
 to
 do
 is
 get
 rid
 of
 him,


change
 this?


So
 they
 a
 year
 before
 like
 not
 in
 that


season
 but
 the
 the the
 two
 years
 before


they
 nearly
 became
 chairman
 was
 a


different
 team
 and
 it
 was
 a
 very


specific
 way
 of
 football
 offensively.
 Oh


my
 god
 they
 were
 ridiculously
 good


defensively.
 Yeah
 lucky
 a
 good
 goalie


there
 stuff
 like
 this
 was
 not
 the
 same.


So
 we
 didn't
 have
 the
 team
 from
 that


time
 we
 didn't
 have
 Suarez.
 We
 didn't


have
 Sterling.
 We
 didn't
 have
 Yeah.
 We


had
 still
 um
 Dennis
 Dur
 stuff
 like
 this


but
 it
 was
 different
 different
 team


completely
 different
 I
 I
 arrived
 there
 I


had
 five
 strikers


>> there
 was


Chris
 Maker
 Denny
 Ings
 Dorigi
 Bobby


Firmino
 Daniel
 Sto
 five
 strikers
 and
 I


want
 to
 play
 one
 striker
 system


how
 do
 we
 deal
 with
 that
 but
 it
 was
 it


was
 fine
 and
 there
 was
 so
 much
 quality


doesn't
 really
 solve
 it
 so
 the
 first


thing
 I
 had
 to
 sort
 is
 like
 to
 organize


them
 so
 find
 a
 way
 to
 make
 sure
 that


they
 understand
 that
 we
 have
 chance
 to


win
 the
 next
 football
 game.
 We
 have
 to


do
 a
 couple
 of
 things
 for
 that.
 But


Tottenham,
 three
 days
 time
 to
 train.


Yeah.
 Jump
 in
 their
 face
 and
 let's
 see


what
 what what
 we
 get
 for
 it.
 So
 that's


it's
 not
 organized.
 It's
 like
 we
 started


with
 an
 organized
 chaos.
 So
 I
 gave
 them


a
 few
 ideas
 about
 where
 we
 have
 to
 where


we
 want
 to
 put
 them
 under
 pressure
 and


in
 that
 moment
 now
 do
 it.
 And
 afterwards


we
 work
 we
 talk
 about
 it
 how
 it
 worked


out
 because
 there
 was
 no
 time
 to
 train.


We
 anyway
 we
 had
 no
 time.
 the
 week
 after


we
 played
 European
 League
 I
 think
 in
 the


midweek
 and
 then
 you
 play
 again
 and
 no


it's
 like
 you
 are
 in
 a
 rush
 and
 a


coaching
 career
 with
 all
 the
 games
 you


have
 to
 play
 if
 you
 really
 want
 to
 a
 top


team
 especially
 if
 you
 really
 want
 to


develop
 a
 style
 of
 football
 you
 are
 set


up
 to
 fail
 because
 it's
 like
 you
 have
 no


time
 in
 the
 preseason
 there's
 no
 their


players
 are
 everywhere
 playing
 big


tournaments
 blah
 blah
 blah
 and
 then
 you


come
 two
 weeks
 before
 the
 season
 starts


into
 your
 camp
 okay
 so
 let's
 try
 let's


go
 from
 here.
 Then
 you
 play
 top
 teams


play
 every
 3
 days
 from
 a
 specific
 date


on.
 We
 obviously
 we
 lost
 a
 lot
 of


finals.
 That
 means
 we
 played
 a
 lot
 of


finals.
 That
 means
 we
 played
 all
 the


games
 until
 the
 end
 of
 the
 season,
 which


is
 a
 lot.
 So
 there's
 no
 really
 time.
 So


to
 train
 and
 really
 develop
 things.
 So


you
 have
 to
 use
 each
 little
 moment
 to


implement
 a
 specific
 idea
 we
 all
 can
 buy


into.
 And
 that's
 what
 we
 did.
 I
 loved


our
 first
 game
 against
 Tottenham.


Simon
 Mino
 they
 had
 to
 make
 a
 good
 few


good
 really
 good
 saves
 but
 they
 had
 to


do
 as
 well
 and
 that
 year
 Tottenham
 was


really
 strong
 there.
 We
 came
 second


behind
 Leicester
 I
 think
 that
 was
 that


season
 and
 that's
 a
 start.


>> What
 are
 those
 little
 ideas
 that
 you


started
 to
 implement
 one
 by
 one?


>> So
 many
 if
 we
 don't
 have
 time
 to
 change


football.


What
 do
 you
 mean?
 We
 are
 all
 not
 genius


and
 we
 cannot
 go
 there
 and
 show
 them
 a


little
 bit.
 Pass
 the
 ball
 here,
 pass
 the


ball
 there
 and
 if
 you
 pass
 the
 ball
 back


again,
 you
 can
 shoot
 on
 your
 alone
 in


front
 of
 the
 goal.
 That
 doesn't
 work


like
 that.
 So
 I
 I'm
 100%
 convinced
 that


you
 have
 to


make
 sure
 that
 you
 are
 stable
 and
 if


you're
 stable
 that
 means
 that
 the
 other


team
 whatever
 they
 try
 it's
 not
 easy
 for


them
 to
 get
 through
 and
 shoot
 just


finish.
 I
 don't
 like
 that.
 So
 if
 you
 can


avoid
 that
 do
 it
 because
 we
 are
 people


but
 we
 are
 now
 realized
 a
 few
 times
 it's


not
 easy
 that
 you
 if
 they
 have
 five
 six


chances
 after
 each
 other
 opportunities


after
 each
 other
 then
 it's
 like
 that
 you


you
 don't
 feel
 great
 nobody
 plays
 his


best
 football
 if
 each
 attack
 of
 the


opponent
 ends
 in
 the
 arms
 of
 your
 goalie


that
 just
 doesn't
 work
 so
 how
 can
 we
 do


that
 in
 stability
 is
 to
 organize
 a
 team


that's
 number
 one
 two
 and
 three
 on
 the


to-do
 list
 of
 a
 successful
 manager
 and


that's
 what
 I
 did
 we
 organize
 and
 then


be
 told
 them
 to
 run
 their
 socks
 off.
 If


you
 people
 have
 to
 sh
 you
 have
 to
 show


the
 people
 that
 you
 want
 to
 change


something,
 you
 have
 to
 show
 the
 people


that
 you
 want
 to
 achieve
 something.
 How


we
 can
 tell
 I
 can
 tell
 them
 but
 the
 end


you
 have
 to
 show
 them.
 So
 run
 and
 and


they
 went
 for
 it
 and
 I
 I
 loved
 it
 so


much.
 They
 loved
 it
 so
 much.
 It's
 easy.


They
 all
 top
 fit.
 They
 want
 to
 run.
 So


just
 show
 them
 which
 direction
 and
 it


goes.
 And
 then
 we
 developed
 step
 by
 step


our
 own
 way
 of
 football.
 Brought
 players


in
 step
 by
 step.
 Um
 but
 we
 got
 we
 got


stable
 pretty
 quickly.
 Not
 as
 much
 as
 we


wanted.
 I
 think
 we
 became
 sixth,


seventh,
 eight.
 I
 I
 don't
 even
 know.


First
 season,
 two
 finals.
 Great.
 Lost


both.
 Not
 great.
 Um
 but
 then
 we
 we
 knew


each
 other
 and
 we
 loved
 working
 together


with
 this
 group.
 Brought
 in
 super


players,
 really
 super
 super
 players,


super
 character
 super
 players


and
 stick
 together.
 And
 I
 mean
 what
 can


you
 do?
 We
 we
 lost
 it.
 We
 lost
 the


European
 League
 final
 in
 Basel.


How
 it
 always
 is,
 there's
 a
 party
 after


the
 game.
 So
 you
 cannot
 organize
 a


party,
 but
 you
 all
 know
 if
 you
 lose,
 who


wants
 to
 go
 to
 the
 party?
 So
 I
 was
 a
 new


manager.
 Yes.
 Not
 that
 new
 anymore.
 7
 8


months
 in
 or
 so.
 And
 I
 realized
 some


players
 under
 there,
 but
 was
 in
 a
 team


hotel.
 So
 I
 told
 I
 called
 them,
 told


them
 all
 here.
 Come
 on,
 come
 downstairs.


Was
 really


I
 tell
 you
 what
 this
 was
 only
 the
 start.


We
 only
 are
 together
 in
 six,
 seven


months.
 This
 is
 not
 the
 last
 final
 we


played.
 This
 is
 the
 first
 final
 we


played.
 Okay,
 we
 lost
 the
 car
 boy.
 It's


not
 important.
 The
 first
 international


final
 we
 lost.
 No
 problem.
 We
 go
 again.


And
 I
 went
 on
 stay
 on
 the
 dance
 floor.


It
 was
 a
 dance
 floor.
 And
 I
 said
 all


coming
 when
 we
 saying
 we
 are
 Liverpool.


I
 mean,
 I
 had
 um
 had
 a
 few
 parties
 after


finals
 we
 lost
 and
 I
 always
 thought
 I


don't
 waste
 time
 at
 all
 on
 not
 being


happy
 about
 what
 we
 achieved
 over
 the


whole
 year
 because
 qualifying
 for
 a


final
 is
 a
 real
 achievement.
 Losing
 it


is
 not
 great,
 but
 until
 then
 everything


was
 fine
 and
 I
 never
 accepted
 that
 we


ignore
 the
 rest.
 So
 we
 have
 a
 party


and
 then
 we
 went
 on
 to
 achieve


new
 things
 and
 we
 need
 a
 bit
 of
 time


obviously
 but
 it
 was
 okay


>> and
 this
 goes
 back
 to
 the
 point
 earlier


about
 controlling
 the
 mindset
 and
 the


psychology
 after
 you
 lose
 to
 make
 sure


that
 you
 don't
 get
 depressed
 and


>> if
 you
 don't
 learn
 from
 a
 defeat
 it's
 a


real
 defeat
 if
 you
 learn
 from
 it
 it's


just
 it's
 a
 very
 very
 important


information
 and
 that's
 how
 I
 always


understood
 understood
 it
 I
 had
 enough


opportunities
 to
 learn.
 Really,
 how
 I


said
 I
 lost
 more
 Champions
 League
 finals


than
 most
 people
 play.
 It's
 not
 a
 great


thing
 to
 say.
 It's
 the
 truth.
 Anyway,


>> you're
 known
 for
 what
 they
 call
 heavy


metal
 football.


>> Yeah,
 but
 that's
 Yeah,
 I
 know.


>> You
 like
 that
 phrase.


And
 do
 you
 know
 why


>> I
 said
 a
 lot
 of
 things,
 but
 it's
 like


they
 that
 I
 said
 that
 it
 was
 not
 in
 my


mind
 that
 I
 thought
 you
 want
 to
 play


heavy
 metal
 football.
 They
 asked
 me


about
 Asen
 Mena
 on
 the
 comparison
 and


they
 they
 think
 we
 are
 similar
 in
 a
 way


and
 I
 thought
 what


and
 I
 know
 so
 come
 on
 don't
 be


disrespectful
 to
 our
 I'm
 a
 young
 baba


man
 from
 somewhere
 um
 but
 if
 you
 want
 to


compare
 us
 then
 I'm
 not
 sure
 that's


possible
 because
 Azen's
 football
 is


rather
 like
 an
 orchestra
 and
 my
 team


plays
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 like
 a
 heavy


metal
 band
 but
 that
 was
 the
 first
 day


when
 I
 thought
 about
 my
 team
 I
 got
 heavy


metal
 band
 but
 it.


>> But
 it's
 true.


>> Yes,
 somehow.


>> It
 is
 true.
 And
 I
 know
 that
 more
 than


anyone
 as
 a
 Manchester
 United
 fan


watching.


>> I'd
 hate
 playing
 your
 football
 teams


because
 they
 they
 ran
 so
 much.
 They
 were


so
 passionate.
 They
 never
 let
 up.
 They


would
 they
 could
 always
 win
 in
 the
 last


minute
 and
 the
 intensity
 was
 you
 were


just
 anxious
 as
 a
 as
 a
 football
 fan


watching
 the
 games
 because
 it
 was
 so


fullon
 and
 it
 was
 overwhel.
 It's
 almost


overwhelming
 emotionally.
 And
 I
 I


remember
 through
 your
 era
 you
 would
 win


sometimes
 you'd
 win
 games
 by
 seven.


You'd
 score
 seven
 goals,
 five
 goals.


Every
 week
 when
 I
 pull
 up
 my
 phone
 to


check
 the
 scores
 that
 week,
 oh,


Liverpool
 have
 scored
 five
 again.
 Oh,


they've
 scored
 seven
 again.
 They've


scored
 six
 again.
 Sometimes
 you
 would


concede
 three,


>> but
 you
 it
 was
 it
 was
 it
 was
 crazy
 how


high
 intensity
 the
 way
 you
 played


football
 was.


>> Don't
 waste
 time
 with
 holding
 back.
 I
 I


don't
 understand
 it.
 We
 have
 nothing
 to


do
 90
 minutes,
 95
 minutes,
 whatever.
 I


don't.
 We
 had
 to
 learn.
 I
 had
 to
 learn


to
 to
 manage
 games


inside
 me
 until
 the
 last
 date
 was
 like


come
 on
 come
 on
 try
 but
 then
 I
 had
 to
 I


I
 mean
 I
 grow
 up
 and
 I
 got
 more
 mature


and
 stuff
 like
 this
 it
 was
 like
 okay


come
 on
 hold
 the
 ball
 control
 the
 ball


all
 the
 things
 you
 you
 at
 one
 point
 you


do
 you
 you
 learn
 some
 at
 any
 time
 on


your
 on
 your
 journey
 and
 that's
 that's


how
 it
 is
 and
 I
 love
 the
 game
 so
 much


and
 could
 play
 it
 not
 that
 good
 that
 I


was
 so
 happy
 that
 I
 could
 work
 with


these
 outstanding
 players.
 I
 couldn't
 so


I
 I
 loved
 it.
 I
 enjoyed
 it
 so
 much


seeing
 them
 doing
 what
 they're
 doing.
 I


was
 I
 was
 number
 one
 supporter
 of
 my


team
 teams
 wherever
 I
 was.
 I
 loved
 what


they
 did.
 So
 that's
 what
 I
 I
 I
 carried


through
 the
 week.
 I
 didn't
 tell
 them.
 I


I
 told
 them
 I
 want
 to
 be
 your
 friend,


but
 don't
 I
 cannot
 be
 your
 best
 friend


because
 I'm
 the
 one
 who
 tells
 you
 off


very
 often
 and
 doesn't
 tell
 you
 this
 is


not
 right.
 This
 is
 not
 right.
 But
 then


but
 the
 feeling
 the
 general
 feeling
 was


I
 love
 them
 in
 my
 mind.
 My
 ex-
 players
 I


love
 them
 all
 and
 some
 of
 them
 don't


love
 back.
 Let
 me
 say
 like
 that
 probably


for
 some
 reasons
 or
 whatever
 but
 that


doesn't
 mean
 anything
 to
 me.
 I
 love
 my


clubs.


>> Do
 you
 think
 it's
 important


how
 you
 win?
 Because
 you
 you
 know
 this


heavy
 metal
 high
 intensity
 oh
 you
 win


>> was
 great
 for
 the
 fans.
 They
 they
 love


watching
 three
 four
 five
 six
 seven
 they


love
 watching
 that
 stuff.
 Do
 you
 think


that
 matters
 or
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 just


about
 getting
 the
 three
 points?


>> Just
 say
 we
 didn't
 win
 that
 often.
 5
 nil


7.


>> It
 felt
 like
 it.


>> It
 felt
 like
 it
 was


>> and
 against
 United
 we
 did.


>> Yeah.
 No.
 Uh
 you
 can
 cut
 it
 out.
 Um


no,
 it's
 Yeah,
 of
 course
 it's
 important.


So
 if
 you
 have
 your
 backpack
 going
 to


stadium
 as
 a
 player,
 if
 you
 have
 your


boots
 and
 if
 you
 have
 wear
 shirt,
 don't


waste
 time
 with
 anything
 than
 giving
 you


all.
 There's
 no
 guarantee
 to
 get


anything
 but
 the
 only
 chance
 to
 get


something.
 So
 give
 your
 all
 from
 the


first
 until
 last
 minute.
 You
 have
 to


understand
 this
 game
 is
 only
 that
 fun


for
 us
 because
 all
 the
 people
 are


watching
 it.
 That's
 why
 we
 earn
 the


money.
 I
 mean
 it.
 I
 know
 that's
 what


people
 want
 to
 hear.
 But
 we
 earn
 the


money
 because
 everybody's
 interested
 in


it.
 Everybody
 wants
 to
 see
 it,
 knows


about
 it,
 reads
 everything
 about
 it,
 all


these
 kind
 of
 things.
 And
 for
 that
 with


all
 the
 stories
 around
 the
 only
 thing
 we


really
 have
 to
 deliver
 is
 give
 your


absolute
 all
 in
 a
 game
 like
 that.


Whatever
 whichever
 game
 is
 there
 5:30,


2:30,
 3:30,
 whenever
 the
 game
 starts,


give
 your
 absolute
 all.


>> But
 why
 not
 just
 1
 nil
 and
 defense
 and


boring
 and
 pass
 it
 around
 and


>> that
 happens.
 That
 happens
 in
 games.
 You


are
 you
 realize
 okay
 we
 score
 a
 goal
 but


today
 is
 not
 our
 days.
 Come
 on
 let's
 get


it
 over
 the
 line.
 that
 happens
 but
 it


cannot
 be
 the
 target
 or
 the
 purpose
 for


the
 next
 game
 again
 let's
 do
 it
 like


that
 not
 for
 there
 are
 clubs
 if
 you
 own


the
 only


realistic
 target
 is
 to
 stay
 in
 the


league
 a
 wonder
 is
 a
 wonderful
 result


but
 we
 talk
 about
 a
 club
 like
 Liverpool


we
 are
 we
 were
 are
 bigger
 than
 that
 you


have
 to
 win
 each
 football
 game
 when
 you


are
 manager
 of
 Liverpool
 that's
 what


people
 that's
 not
 that
 before
 the
 season


anybody
 thinks
 oh
 38
 eight
 games.
 Oh,
 it


makes
 sense.
 Oo,
 more
 than
 100
 a
 nobody


had
 ever.
 So,
 it's
 not
 like
 that.
 But


still,
 each
 defeat
 and
 each
 draw
 is


like,
 how
 could
 that
 happen?
 It's
 like


and
 that's
 why
 you
 have
 to
 to
 play
 in
 a


specific
 way.
 Not
 all
 clubs
 have
 the


same
 things
 to
 do,
 but
 the
 top
 clubs,


they
 have
 to
 win
 all
 the
 games.
 And
 when


you
 have
 the
 chance,
 you
 win
 them
 clear.


You
 win
 them
 with
 a
 proper
 result,
 stuff


like
 this.
 You
 have
 to
 make
 the
 people


enjoy
 the
 football
 you
 play.
 And
 I
 love


to
 do
 that.
 I
 I
 loved
 it.
 I
 honestly


it's
 like
 the
 the
 games
 we
 played
 the


the the
 the
 results
 we
 we
 had
 were
 just


incredible.
 It's
 just
 amazing.
 Not
 all


of
 them.
 And
 I
 love
 the
 one
 nils
 as
 much


as
 I
 do
 all
 the
 others.
 The
 Champions


League
 final
 was
 the
 worst
 the
 worst


final
 of
 all
 the
 four
 my
 teams
 played.


But
 we
 won
 it.
 Would
 I
 take
 would
 I


change
 say
 okay
 let's
 the
 other
 three
 as


well
 a
 little
 bit.
 The
 performance
 in


other
 games
 was
 really
 good
 but
 we
 lost.


So
 here
 we
 are.
 Yeah,
 it
 was
 not


fantastic
 but
 we
 won.
 So
 all
 fine.
 It's


about
 the
 result
 but
 if
 you
 have
 a


result
 and
 another
 result
 it
 has
 to
 lead


to
 really
 good
 football
 at
 one
 point
 as


good
 as
 possible
 for
 your
 specific
 team.


You
 want
 to
 stay
 in
 the
 league
 do
 it


with
 good
 football.
 You
 want
 to
 qualify


for
 Europe
 do
 it
 with
 good
 football


because
 we
 are
 there
 for
 the
 people.
 We


don't
 it's
 not
 there
 that
 we
 just
 go


home
 and
 people
 think
 oh
 it's


unwatchable
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I
 come
 next


week
 again
 that's
 not
 that's
 not
 fair


try
 to
 play
 the
 game
 is
 really
 is
 is


really
 cool
 game
 so
 let's
 make
 sure
 that


everybody
 sees
 it


>> and
 what
 is
 the
 Liverpool
 way
 what
 is


inherent
 in
 when
 you
 come
 to
 Liverpool


and
 you
 are
 the
 manager
 or
 you
 are
 a


player
 what
 is
 the
 thing
 that
 you
 have


to
 do
 that's
 specific
 to
 Liverpool
 in


order
 to
 be
 successful


>> you
 have
 to
 understand
 the
 community
 and


with
 the
 community
 as
 a
 city
 community


as
 a
 bigger
 community
 around
 the
 world


and
 there
 are
 so
 many
 people
 and
 this


club
 went
 through
 a
 lot
 not
 as
 the
 only


club
 in
 the
 world
 but
 come
 on
 for
 that


moment
 we
 just
 think
 about
 ourself
 went


through
 a
 lot
 the
 reaction
 of
 to
 these


situations
 was
 always
 exceptional
 to
 be


100%
 honest
 and
 that's
 what
 you
 have
 to


understand
 what
 you
 have
 to
 learn
 that


that
 mean
 this
 club
 means
 more
 to
 the


people
 than
 just
 football
 so
 that
 you


you
 have
 to
 understand
 and
 that's
 why


what
 we
 do
 is
 more
 important
 than
 it


maybe
 is
 somewhere
 where
 else
 that


that's
 the
 responsibility
 responsibility


we
 always
 took
 and
 understood
 100%
 our


boy
 the
 players
 understood
 to
 play
 for


Liverpool
 is
 not
 just
 a
 club
 where
 you


play
 during
 your
 career
 it's
 the
 club


and
 it's
 something
 you
 will
 definitely


remember
 for
 life
 so
 that
 we
 try
 we
 try


to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 boys
 understood


if
 we
 give
 our
 absolute
 everything
 now


we
 meet
 in
 10
 15
 years
 look
 back
 and
 we


I
 think
 it
 was
 the
 best
 we
 could
 have


done.
 The
 absolute
 best
 we
 could
 have


done.
 I
 think
 that's
 how
 you
 the
 my
 view


on
 life
 is
 as
 well.
 All
 the
 other
 stuff


is
 just
 sorting
 the
 problem
 in
 front
 of


you.


>> Mhm.


>> There's
 something
 we
 have
 to
 sort.
 But


when
 you
 saw
 you
 think
 about
 what's
 the


effect
 for
 for
 for
 the
 rest
 and
 that's


what
 some
 people
 some
 clubs
 maybe
 don't


want
 to
 see
 because
 the
 pressure
 is
 too


big
 just
 to
 make
 sure
 okay
 tomorrow
 at


least
 they
 will
 not
 write
 we
 have
 no


clue
 tomorrow
 at least
 they
 will
 say


they
 found
 a
 solution
 and
 then
 we
 can


think
 about
 um
 the
 next
 day
 or
 whatever.


How
 does
 how
 does
 someone
 I
 don't
 know


how
 someone
 succeed
 succeeds
 you
 because


you
 have
 such
 a
 big
 aura.
 Are
 you
 aware


that
 you
 have
 a
 big
 aura?


>> Don't
 know
 if
 anybody
 has
 the
 awareness


of
 that.
 I
 heard
 about
 it
 but
 I
 doesn't


that
 don't
 know
 what
 it
 means
 100%
 to
 be


honest
 but
 I
 see
 it
 with
 other
 people.


>> An
 energy
 when
 you
 you
 arrive
 it's
 the


passion.
 It's
 the
 ability
 to
 talk.
 It's


the
 ability
 to
 inspire
 people.
 it
 is,


you
 know,
 has
 an
 impact
 on
 the
 rival


team
 you're
 playing
 because
 they
 go


clocks
 here
 and
 big
 personality,
 big


charisma.


So,
 Anie
 Slaugh
 coming
 in
 after
 you,


he's
 he
 doesn't
 appear
 to
 be
 as
 have
 the


same
 size
 of
 an
 aura.
 And
 I
 I
 don't


know.
 I
 just
 think
 big
 big
 shoes
 to
 fill


in
 terms
 of
 your
 aura.


>> I
 have
 to
 go
 to
 the
 toilet.


>> I
 bet
 you
 do.


>> Oh,
 really?


>> Okay.
 Okay.


Okay,
 that's
 good.


>> Big
 shoes.


Big
 shoes.
 I
 would
 not
 want
 to
 fill
 such


shoes.
 A
 couple
 of
 things.
 First
 and


foremost,
 I
 uh
 I
 thought
 I
 have


to
 say
 what
 I
 had
 to
 say
 when
 I
 when
 I


um
 announced
 my
 exit,
 if
 you
 want,
 my


retirement,
 whatever
 you
 want
 to
 call


it,
 at
 the
 time.
 And
 people
 judge
 that


wrong
 moment
 blah
 blah
 blah
 whatever
 you


cannot
 change
 that
 it
 was
 fine
 the


feeling
 was
 I
 have
 to
 say
 that
 then
 we


have
 to
 finish
 the
 season
 as
 good
 as


somehow
 possible
 in
 idle
 world
 you
 win


something
 we
 couldn't
 do
 that
 for


whatever
 reason
 and
 then
 you
 have
 to


make
 sure
 because
 that's
 still
 something


you
 have
 to
 do
 you
 have
 to
 try


to
 make
 it
 as
 easy
 as
 somehow
 possible


for
 the
 guy
 who's
 coming
 after
 you
 what


I
 tried
 as
 well
 because
 I
 wanted


them
 all
 to
 do
 do
 incredibly
 well.


And
 also
 if
 somebody
 is
 not
 doing
 it


that
 way,
 you
 it's
 a
 first


the
 first
 hint
 you
 can
 get
 that
 maybe
 he


wants
 the
 next
 guy
 not
 to
 do
 it
 well.


Every
 shouting,
 oh
 my
 god,
 he
 did
 that,


he
 did
 that,
 he
 did
 that.
 And
 I
 don't


need
 that.
 I
 want
 Liverpool
 to
 do
 well.


I
 want
 Liverpool
 to
 win.
 But
 they
 did.


So
 what
 I
 liked
 a
 lot
 about
 Arnold
 that


Arnold
 didn't
 hesitate.
 But
 you
 said,


"No,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 in
 these
 shoes."


A
 didn't
 have
 that
 problem.
 He
 thought,


"Okay,
 that's
 a
 that's
 a
 great
 club.


That's
 a
 great
 team."
 And
 he's
 right.
 It


was
 a
 fantastic
 It's
 a
 fantastic
 club


and
 it's
 a
 fantastic
 team.
 And
 he


stepped
 into
 that.
 We
 had
 a
 lot
 of


contact
 after
 that.
 He
 was
 super


It's
 a
 super
 super
 good
 guy.
 Um,
 my
 god,


what
 a
 team.
 Wow.
 Thanks
 a
 lot.
 Blah


blah
 blah.
 All
 these
 kind
 of
 things.
 And


yeah
 and
 he
 made
 the
 best
 he
 got
 the


best
 out
 of
 this
 team
 and
 they
 they


became
 champion
 in
 incredible
 manner
 to


be
 honest.
 So
 and
 I'm
 really
 really


happy
 about
 that.
 So
 that's
 all
 that's


all
 you
 you
 is
 it
 it
 all
 about
 it
 shows


again
 it's
 all
 about
 how
 you
 see
 it.
 You


can
 see
 you
 step
 into
 my
 footsteps
 how


you
 called
 it.


>> Mhm.


>> Or
 you
 take
 over
 a
 fantastic
 football


team.
 It
 was
 a
 brilliant
 I
 mean
 my
 my


best
 friend's
 a
 Liverpool
 fan
 and
 he


said
 before
 you
 left
 actually
 he
 said


this
 is
 the
 best
 squad
 Liverpool
 have


ever
 had.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 Anie
 has
 inherited
 that
 squad
 which


is
 considered
 to
 be
 the
 best
 squad
 by


many
 people
 that
 Liverpool
 have
 ever


had.


>> And
 in
 that
 first
 year
 didn't
 really


change
 much.
 There
 wasn't
 really
 there


wasn't
 any
 big
 signings
 coming.
 I


actually
 heard
 from
 one
 of
 the
 the


players
 in
 Liverpool
 that
 them
 say
 to
 a


really
 good
 friend
 of
 mine
 that
 the
 best


thing
 Arie
 had
 done
 was
 actually
 in
 that


first
 year
 don't
 change
 much
 don't
 come


in
 and
 try
 and
 radically
 change
 things


and


>> that's
 what
 Anna
 slot
 would
 say
 himself


probably
 I
 think
 he
 said
 it
 that's
 super


smart
 so
 it's
 not
 about
 what
 Anna
 wants


to
 show
 the
 world
 what
 he
 can
 do
 it's


about
 how
 to
 get
 the
 best
 out
 of
 this


team
 and
 that's
 exactly
 what
 he
 did
 not


changing
 much
 means
 he
 changed
 a
 little


bit
 we
 became
 third
 a
 year
 before
 So


there's
 not
 a
 lot
 you
 have
 to
 change,


but
 a
 few
 decisive
 things
 you
 have
 to


change
 and
 all
 of a
 sudden
 you
 win
 the


league
 by
 some
 distance.
 So
 that's
 what


it
 is.
 Not
 that
 he
 has
 to
 put
 his
 new


own
 stamp.
 This
 team
 was
 was
 was
 good
 in


in
 a
 lot
 of
 ways,
 but
 we
 didn't
 win
 the


year
 before.
 So
 and
 that's
 what
 he
 what


his
 what
 his
 um
 job
 was.
 And
 he
 did
 that


in
 an
 incredible
 impressive
 manner.
 So


and
 that's
 all
 you
 want.
 And
 you
 need


people
 who
 have
 the
 confidence
 to
 do


these
 kind
 of
 things
 because
 um
 doesn't


make
 sense
 if
 you
 have
 a
 a
 manager
 who


is
 not
 100%
 sure
 about
 the
 things
 he


wants
 to
 do
 and
 I
 want
 us
 to
 play
 like


this
 or
 if
 that's
 not
 possible
 I
 want
 to


play
 like
 this
 or
 I
 want
 to
 but
 we
 maybe


completely
 different
 that
 doesn't
 work.


Being
 a
 football
 manager
 is
 already
 a


challenge
 with
 all
 the
 different
 things


you
 have
 to
 do.
 Being
 a
 football
 manager


in
 in
 in
 such
 a
 competitive
 league
 like


a
 Premier
 League
 is
 a
 real
 challenge.


Being
 a
 football
 manager
 in
 the
 world
 we


are
 living
 in
 with
 media,


social
 media
 and
 all
 these
 kind
 of


things.
 It's
 an
 incredible
 challenge.


Believe
 me,
 you
 you
 have
 no
 clue
 what's


coming
 up
 the
 next
 day.
 You
 think,
 "Oh


my
 god,
 where's
 that
 coming
 from?


Who
 was
 that?
 Oh,
 my
 player.
 You
 read
 a


story,
 whatever,
 and
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 you


think,


oh,
 from
 a
 problem,
 it
 turns
 into
 your


problem
 and
 a
 and
 a
 wing.
 So,
 sort
 that


and
 all
 the
 rest
 as
 well.
 So,
 you
 need


this
 kind
 of
 I
 love
 that
 about
 Arnet


that
 he
 came
 in
 and
 and
 took
 over
 and
 he


knew
 he
 got
 a
 good
 team.
 Yes,
 it
 was.


Um,
 and
 did
 a
 perfect
 job.


I
 mean
 in
 terms
 of
 making
 changes
 this


year
 you
 Liverpool
 have
 spent
 what
 450


odd
 million
 which
 is
 a
 crazy
 number.
 I


mean
 the
 bro
 I
 think
 he
 broken
 the


transfer
 record
 in
 various
 positions


several
 times
 with
 warts
 and
 um
 with


ESAC
 now
 as
 well.
 So
 change
 has
 arrived.


These
 are
 these
 are
 new
 people
 coming
 in


with
 their
 their
 own
 ideologies
 from


their
 previous
 clubs.
 They've
 all


arrived
 at
 once.
 A
 lot
 of
 new
 faces
 at


once.
 Is
 this
 not
 now
 where
 the


challenge
 begins?
 because
 this
 is
 this


is
 going
 to
 become
 Anie's
 team
 now.


>> Yeah,
 but
 that's
 not
 a
 problem.
 That's


just
 completely
 normal.
 That
 doesn't


mean
 exactly
 that
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of


change.
 I
 mean,


no
 team
 in
 the
 by
 the
 way,
 it's
 450
 or


whatever
 million.
 I
 don't
 know
 the
 exact


numbers,
 but
 they
 they
 earned
 a
 lot
 of


money
 as
 well.
 Um,
 and
 change
 always
 has


an
 impact
 and
 change
 always
 needs
 time


and
 don't
 but
 people
 talk
 then
 about


yeah,
 but
 this
 if
 no
 let's
 start
 like


that.
 He
 keeps
 this
 exactly
 same
 team


like
 us.
 Yes,
 Darin
 Yun
 is
 still
 there.


Luis
 Diaz
 is
 still
 there
 as
 an
 example.


So
 they
 start
 playing
 but
 they
 have


problems.
 Say
 yeah
 change
 and
 we
 needed


change.
 So
 now
 they're
 not
 there


anymore.
 The
 new
 guys
 are
 there
 and
 they


are
 good
 really
 really
 good
 players.


It's
 not
 working
 out.
 Yeah,
 why
 why
 it's


not
 working?
 Because
 development
 needs


time
 then
 nobody
 can
 change
 that
 and


people
 need
 to
 find
 uh
 need
 to
 adapt
 to


situation
 need
 adapt
 to
 things
 and
 that


all
 these
 kind
 of
 things.
 So
 it's
 all


it's
 all
 good.
 It's
 all
 in
 place.
 What


you
 have
 at
 Liverpool
 this
 year
 has
 to


be
 in
 the
 competition
 in
 the
 decisive


moments
 and
 then
 they
 have
 to
 be
 ready


to
 go
 for
 it.
 There's
 no
 guarantee
 that


you
 then
 will
 win
 it
 again.
 That
 doesn't


happen
 just
 like
 this.
 You
 cannot
 be


champion,
 spend
 money
 and
 be
 champion


again.
 The
 other
 teams
 don't
 sleep.


That's
 how
 it
 is.
 And
 to
 become


champion,
 you
 need
 luck
 in
 moments
 here


and
 there.
 That's
 how
 it
 is.
 Nobody


wants
 to
 hear
 that.


crossbar


over
 the
 line,
 not
 over
 the
 line,
 all


these
 kind
 of
 things.
 It
 can
 go
 in
 your


direction
 or
 in
 the
 other
 direction.
 So,


it's
 all
 fine.
 And
 we
 discuss
 the


situation
 now
 like
 it's
 a
 h
 they


struggle.
 Surprise.
 Yeah.
 We
 we
 take
 we


take
 the
 money
 and
 throw
 it
 against


them.
 450
 million.
 Yeah.
 But
 they
 earned


200
 odd
 million
 as
 well.
 So
 it's
 all


fine
 if
 you're
 with
 Liverpool
 and
 only


these
 people
 are
 really
 that's
 the
 only


only
 people
 who
 matter
 if
 you
 are
 with


Liverpool.
 Yeah,
 you
 trust
 them
 and
 they


do
 the
 right
 they
 did
 the
 right
 stuff.


They
 do
 the
 right
 things.
 So
 work
 on
 it


and
 become
 the
 best
 football
 team
 this


team
 can
 be.


>> You
 never
 had
 a
 transfer
 window
 like


that
 where
 you
 spent
 that
 much
 money
 and


>> No,
 we
 built
 we
 built
 three
 stands
 and


and
 a
 training
 ground.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 And
 and
 I
 remember
 the


press
 conference
 I
 think
 when
 you
 were


referring
 to
 City's
 ability
 to
 spend


money.


>> I
 had
 no
 clue
 that
 this
 is
 possible.


>> Nobody
 nobody
 ever
 told
 me
 that
 it's


possible
 that
 we
 can
 that
 we
 can
 spend


like
 that
 my
 last
 year
 Liverpool.
 So
 we


obviously


so
 the
 Adidas
 deal
 the
 new
 stadium
 all


these
 kind
 of
 things.
 Yeah
 they
 earn


more
 money
 but
 it
 was
 never
 no
 never


ever
 I
 I
 could
 have
 asked
 for
 the
 amount


of
 money
 but
 that's
 not
 a
 problem
 that


time
 it
 was
 not
 there.
 No
 problem
 at


all.
 really
 not.
 And


I
 love
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 were
 as


successful
 as
 we
 were
 and


build
 new
 stands
 and
 build
 a
 training


ground
 because
 we
 talk
 now
 about
 a


transfer
 window
 in
 the
 way
 you
 want
 to


talk
 about
 it,
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 Um,


but
 there's
 no
 discussion
 about
 the


stance
 and
 no
 discussion
 about
 the


training
 ground.
 They
 are
 second
 to


none.
 The
 training
 ground,
 the
 stands


are
 wonderful.
 So,
 and
 and
 at
 the
 same


place
 where
 Enfield
 is,
 they
 could
 build


pretty
 much
 a
 new
 stadium
 without


leaving
 the
 old
 one.
 So,
 that's
 a


fantastic
 story
 and
 that
 will
 stay


forever.
 Maybe
 at
 one
 point
 they
 decide


the
 cop
 could
 be
 even
 for
 more
 people
 or


whatever.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that
 ever
 will


happen,
 but
 you
 could
 do
 stuff
 there.


And
 that's
 what
 I
 love
 about
 this.
 And
 I


think
 I
 really
 want
 as
 much
 as
 I
 can.


And
 it's
 not
 my
 first
 target
 because
 I


have
 to
 win
 football
 games
 with
 my
 team,


but
 I
 want
 that
 a
 club
 benefits
 from
 the


time
 we
 were
 together
 after
 we
 left.
 I


want
 that.


>> This
 might
 be
 quite
 a
 naive
 observation,


but
 in
 the
 time
 when
 you
 were
 at


Liverpool,
 my
 assessment
 of
 Liverpool


was
 you
 never
 you
 didn't
 necessarily


have
 the
 world's
 most
 famous
 starting
 11


team,
 but
 you
 could
 beat
 anybody.
 Mhm.


>> So,
 you
 know,
 when
 you
 brought
 in


Milner,
 who
 was
 at
 City
 before,
 and
 when


you
 brought
 in
 these
 other
 players,
 I


would
 see
 I'd
 be
 like,
 why
 why
 are
 they


signing
 him?
 He's
 not.
 But
 then
 when


they'd
 play
 for
 Liverpool,
 they
 would
 be


unbelievable
 players,
 and
 you
 could
 be


anybody.
 So,
 there
 was
 almost
 this


culture
 at
 Liverpool,
 which
 which
 I


observed,
 where
 you
 didn't
 necessarily


go
 for
 Galactico
 players.
 You
 weren't


trying
 to
 get
 Ronaldo
 or
 Messi.
 You
 were


going
 for
 sort
 of
 these
 players
 that
 had


character
 and
 and
 a
 culture
 fit.
 And


ultimately
 that
 meant
 that
 you
 know
 you


at
 times
 it
 looked
 like
 you
 were
 playing


with
 12
 men.
 And
 so
 this
 new
 this


transfer
 window
 that
 I've
 just
 observed


where
 you
 you
 have
 gone
 for
 the
 very


very
 best
 names
 the
 you
 know
 some
 of
 the


best
 players
 on
 planet
 earth
 that
 were


number
 one
 choices
 for
 Real
 Madrid
 and


the
 biggest
 clubs
 on
 earth.
 I
 almost


don't
 recognize
 Liverpool
 it
 moving
 like


that
 in
 a
 window.


>> Yeah.
 There's
 part
 of
 me
 that
 I'm
 like,


well,
 hopefully
 that
 this
 is
 their
 Falca


Di
 Maria
 moment,
 Ronaldo
 moment
 where


they
 where
 they
 bought
 big
 players
 but


they
 didn't
 think
 of
 culture.
 I'm


praying.


>> Yeah,
 you
 wish.


I
 wish


>> that's
 the
 difference.
 Your
 wish


is
 incredible
 striker.
 Incredible


striker.
 Floss
 you
 all
 will
 eat
 your


words
 if
 you
 have
 the
 wrong
 use
 the


wrong
 words
 or
 is
 an
 incredible
 talent.


Incredible
 player.
 Um
 yeah,
 just


offensive
 players.
 It's
 a
 really
 really


really
 good
 well
 you


squat.


If
 the
 young
 center
 half
 is
 not
 getting


injured,
 it's
 a
 perfect
 squad.
 Now
 he's


injured.
 That
 doesn't
 help.
 Then
 you


might
 be
 a
 majority
 on
 the
 center
 half


position.
 Besides
 that,
 it's
 a
 perfect


squad.
 Two
 super
 left
 backs,
 really


super
 right
 back.
 So
 it's
 it's
 just
 a


really
 good
 football.
 That's
 how
 you
 set


a
 team
 up.
 And
 now
 you
 have
 to
 deal
 with


the
 situation.
 They
 all
 think
 they
 have


to
 start
 the
 game
 but
 that's
 the
 normal


job.
 It's
 not
 that
 difficult
 or
 that's


the
 normal
 job.
 You
 have
 this
 discussion


who
 will
 start
 a
 week
 or
 two
 in
 a
 then


third
 week
 one
 is
 injured
 and
 you
 are


happy
 that
 the
 other
 can
 start.
 So


that's
 that's
 the
 the
 world
 a
 football


manager
 is
 living
 in.
 So
 we
 have
 we


don't
 have
 to
 to
 worry
 about


what's
 that
 the
 I'm
 really
 interested.


So
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 worry
 about


Liverpool.
 They
 will
 be
 fine.
 This
 was


the
 just
 the
 net
 spend
 graph
 of
 the


different
 clubs


um


while
 you
 were
 while
 you
 were
 there.
 And


it's
 quite
 clear
 that
 you
 um
 you
 weren't


spending
 the
 same
 as
 your
 rivals
 during


your
 time.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 fans
 in
 the


media
 speculated
 that
 the
 owners,
 the


Fenway
 Sports
 Group,
 just
 weren't
 giving


you
 the
 money,
 but
 you
 were
 still


getting
 the
 results,
 which
 is
 pretty


>> No,
 no,
 no.
 So,
 yeah.
 What's
 the
 What's


the
 public
 perception
 that
 I
 didn't
 ask


for
 the
 money?
 That's
 probably
 not


right.
 I
 we
 had
 these
 conversations
 but


I
 didn't
 ask
 in
 a
 way
 if
 you
 don't
 get


it


we
 can
 do
 it.
 It's
 not
 my
 job
 to
 think


about
 how
 much
 we
 can
 squeeze
 out
 of


whatever
 area.
 I
 was
 I
 I
 felt
 massively


respond
 my
 my my
 idea
 was
 always
 with


the
 the
 boys
 we
 have


become
 the
 best
 team
 you
 can
 be
 and


you're
 right
 when
 you
 said
 um
 we
 were


maybe
 not
 the
 best
 team
 I
 think
 there


was
 a
 period
 when


we
 played
 football
 you
 could
 have


thought
 that's
 maybe
 the
 best
 played
 by


the
 best
 team
 I
 don't
 know
 exactly


between
 18
 and
 20
 there
 was
 a
 pretty


long
 spell
 um
 but
 We
 always
 and
 it
 was


the
 idea.
 We
 always
 were
 able
 to
 beat


the
 best
 team.
 And
 that
 was
 the
 idea


because
 that's
 a
 constant
 thing.
 The


next
 best,
 the
 next
 best,
 we
 can
 beat


you,
 we
 can
 beat
 you,
 be
 the
 best,
 you


know,
 you
 are
 the
 one
 everybody
 wants
 to


beat.
 I
 love
 that.
 So
 that's
 net
 spend


and
 stuff
 like
 this.
 I
 was
 never
 too


worried
 about.
 We
 had
 all
 these


conversations.
 Yeah.
 I
 I
 was
 I
 was
 happy


with
 how
 it
 was.
 I
 couldn't
 have


discussions
 with
 people.
 No,
 I
 cannot


decide
 how
 much
 money
 we
 spend.
 It's
 not


just
 not
 possible
 and
 slot
 cannot
 decide


how
 much
 money
 Liverpool
 spend.
 That's


how
 it
 is.
 You
 do
 there
 are
 other
 people


who
 decide
 that
 and
 if
 you
 have
 the


money
 then
 you
 spend
 for
 really
 good


players
 what
 Liverpool
 did
 this
 year.


And
 I
 think
 it
 was
 it
 was
 the
 right


thing
 to
 do.
 And


I'm
 pretty
 sure


one
 specific
 moment
 changed
 the
 whole


transfer
 window.


Yeah.
 That
 was
 the
 the
 saddest
 day
 of
 of


last
 year.
 Um,
 and
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you


replace
 somebody
 like
 Joo?


It's
 not
 about
 the
 player
 itself.
 It's


about
 the
 the
 the
 guy
 he
 was.


It
 was
 he
 was
 good
 with
 absolutely


everybody.
 Absolutely
 everybody.
 his
 he


arrived
 he
 had
 no
 real
 it
 was
 I
 think
 he


was
 a
 bit
 surprised
 that
 we
 approached


him
 that
 we
 asked
 for
 him
 then
 he
 came


and
 then
 we
 he
 delivered
 from
 day
 one
 I


remember
 still
 when
 I
 saw
 him
 the
 first


time
 playing
 for
 wolves
 he
 saidoo
 what's


that
 when
 I
 went
 to
 the
 you
 always
 hear


these
 stories
 when
 people
 tell
 me
 and


it's
 it's
 true
 that
 Malah
 they
 had
 to


convince
 me
 and
 stuff
 like
 this
 not


convinced
 that
 I
 take
 him
 but
 it
 was


like
 there
 were
 other
 players
 as
 well


and
 Mo
 was
 one
 of
 the
 others
 and
 then
 we


we
 decided
 all
 together
 for
 Mo
 but
 fine


but
 this
 nobody
 came
 to
 me
 and
 told
 me


come
 on
 let's
 have
 a
 look
 at
 at
 yoga
 I


saw
 him
 and
 I
 said
 please
 give
 me
 more


material
 I
 have
 to
 see
 him
 and
 that's


and
 he
 he
 he
 he
 excelled
 all
 the


expectations
 as
 as
 a
 guy
 super
 smart


super
 super
 teammate
 and
 now
 he
 sits
 in


a
 dressing
 room
 and
 I
 I
 cannot
 imagine


right
 now
 the
 dressing
 room
 without
 him


being
 there
 that's
 as
 so
 hard
 it's
 so


hard
 I
 still
 cannot
 speak
 properly
 about


it
 it's
 it's
 really
 like
 that.
 It
 was
 an


incredible
 shock
 and
 that's
 for
 the
 boys


as
 well
 and
 and
 I
 don't
 we
 could
 think


we
 don't
 speak
 about
 it
 because


otherwise
 some
 bad
 journalists
 make
 a


story
 of
 it
 what
 I
 said
 about
 him
 and


how
 it
 what
 it
 means.
 Nobody
 at


Liverpool
 will
 ever
 use
 it
 as
 an
 excuse


but
 it
 is
 the
 situation
 you
 walk
 every


day
 in
 this
 room
 where
 he
 was


omniresent.


He
 was


can
 you
 imagine
 he
 to
 to
 to
 talk
 about


Timmy
 he
 he
 was
 so
 close
 with
 ch
 with


James
 Milner
 they
 are
 not
 the
 same
 age


group
 they're
 nothing
 the
 same
 it's
 just


he
 was
 so
 but
 on
 the
 other
 side
 very


close
 with
 cost
 simas
 that's
 like
 mount


and
 moon
 and
 Mars
 so
 that's


that
 was
 him
 and
 dealing
 with
 that
 as
 a


per
 on
 a
 personal
 level
 not
 easy


impossible
 and
 now
 as
 a
 club
 take
 all


the
 the
 emotional
 stuff
 out
 and
 think


How
 do
 we
 replace
 him?
 And
 you
 have
 to


think
 about
 that.
 Wow,
 that's
 difficult.


Impossible,
 I
 would
 say.
 And
 now
 we


charge
 a
 transfer
 window
 where
 they
 buy


the
 players.
 There
 was
 not
 the
 plan.
 I'm


pretty
 sure
 the
 two
 that
 he
 had
 to
 get


to
 um


replaced.


>> Do
 you
 remember
 where
 you
 were
 when
 you


heard
 the
 news?


>> Yeah.


I
 got
 a
 message
 in
 the
 morning.
 Boss,
 I


have
 bad
 news.
 And
 then
 I
 got
 and
 I
 got


a
 message
 from
 a
 from
 a
 friend
 from


Liverpool
 and


and
 I
 I I
 couldn't
 believe
 it.
 I
 I
 just


it
 was
 not
 possible.
 I
 heard
 it
 and
 I


know
 what
 it
 means
 but
 I
 couldn't


believe
 it.


the
 whole
 story.
 I
 saw
 all
 the
 pictures


obviously
 from
 the
 wedding
 and
 all
 the


boys
 were
 there
 and
 and
 stuff
 like
 that


and
 it
 was
 so
 was
 only
 before
 that
 and


um


I
 know
 exactly
 where
 I
 was.
 I
 was
 I
 was


exactly
 how
 long
 I
 sat
 there
 without


speaking
 a
 word.
 So


it
 it
 is
 it
 is
 it
 is
 a
 family
 member.
 is


exactly
 like
 that.


So
 look,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 really
 like


that.
 You
 have
 it's
 it's
 an
 example


for
 the
 things
 you
 have
 to
 deal
 with


without
 knowing
 at
 all.
 You
 cannot
 be


prepared
 to
 deal
 with
 things
 like
 that.


And
 today
 we
 we
 talk
 about
 the
 the


transfer
 window
 in
 the
 name
 if
 you
 want


of
 Liverpool
 that
 would
 have
 looked


completely
 different.
 Yeah.
 So
 you
 have


to
 sort
 the
 things
 you
 did
 never


expected
 that
 you
 have
 to
 think
 about.


Everybody
 wanted
 this
 boy
 to
 play
 the


next


10
 years
 at
 Liverpool.
 Allound
 player,


all
 positions
 can
 play
 football
 smart.


On
 July
 the
 3rd,
 2025,
 Diego
 was
 killed


in
 a
 car
 crash
 alongside
 his
 brother
 in


Spain.
 Um
 I
 think
 re
 just
 just
 before


then
 he
 had
 got
 married
 to
 his
 partner


and
 he
 had
 several
 beautiful
 children.


He
 he
 said
 of
 you
 he
 said
 the
 first
 time


you
 and
 him
 met
 he
 just
 felt
 your


presence.
 He
 said
 I
 think
 that's
 one
 of


his
 main
 characteristics
 the
 way
 you
 can


you
 can
 just
 feel
 him
 only
 with
 his


presence.


And
 Diego
 went
 on
 to
 be
 incredibly


successful
 under
 your
 leadership
 at


Liverpool.


>> Yeah


that's
 true.
 Yeah.
 same.
 I
 could
 say
 the


same.
 I
 could
 say
 the
 same
 about
 him.
 I


was
 as
 impressed


with
 his
 presence.
 Very,
 very
 special.


Very
 special


young
 man,
 I
 have
 to
 say.


>> How
 much
 of
 a
 role
 do
 does
 a
 manager


like
 you
 play
 in
 the
 transfer
 window?


This
 is
 something
 that's
 always


speculated
 by
 the
 fans.


>> Do
 you
 remember
 the
 first
 when
 I
 came


and
 told
 me
 about
 a
 transfer
 committee?


I
 never
 had
 they
 they
 told
 me
 that
 the


journalist
 asked
 me
 yeah
 because
 they


implemented
 a
 transfer
 committee
 because


they
 didn't
 want
 to
 have
 the
 man
 that


the
 manager
 is
 that
 decisive
 in
 a


transfer
 window.
 Obviously
 before
 me


there
 was
 some
 issues.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 no
 problem
 with
 that.
 I
 can
 discuss


with
 everyone
 as
 long
 as
 no
 player
 signs


for
 the
 club
 I
 don't
 want.
 I'm
 used
 to


not
 getting
 all
 the
 players
 I
 want.


That's
 completely
 normal.
 It's
 not
 up
 to


the
 coaches.
 We
 say
 we
 need
 want
 that


player
 and
 I
 say
 yeah
 it's
 too


expensive.
 They
 can
 ask
 again,
 sorry,


can
 we
 make
 it
 happen?
 Um,
 and
 knowing


they
 all
 try
 through
 everything
 to
 get


the
 right
 price
 and
 get
 the
 player
 in.


You
 cannot
 do
 anything
 with
 that
 that


anybody
 in
 a
 club
 would
 bring
 in
 a


player.
 You
 don't
 you
 don't
 agree
 on


that.
 That's
 that
 that's
 not
 possible.


But
 it's
 very
 very
 normal
 in
 the


football
 code
 manager
 life
 that
 you


don't
 get
 all
 the
 players
 you
 want.
 So


no
 problem
 with
 that.
 As
 long
 as
 the


transfer
 window
 is
 open,
 you
 try
 to


create
 build
 the
 best
 possible
 squad.
 On


the
 day
 after
 the
 transfer
 window,
 you


have
 the
 best
 possible
 squad,
 whichever


transfers
 you
 made,
 and
 that's
 the
 way


you
 go
 into
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 season.


Michael
 Edwards
 left
 during
 your
 tenure.


He
 was
 sort
 of
 one
 of
 the
 key
 people


that
 that
 was
 responsible
 for
 looking


for
 players
 and
 and
 signing
 them,
 and


he's
 back
 now.


So
 first
 and
 foremost
 before
 I
 don't


want
 to
 say
 anything
 else
 because
 I


really
 have
 a
 really
 good
 relationship


my
 is
 absolutely
 great
 in
 what
 he's


doing.
 Um
 but
 it
 was
 not
 on
 one
 day
 his


job
 alone
 to
 bring
 in
 players.
 There


were
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 Julian
 board
 Ian


Graham
 um
 so
 many
 people
 they
 were


involved
 in
 in
 in
 Barry
 Hunter
 all
 these


kind
 of
 things
 were
 involved
 in
 these


kind
 of
 things.
 It
 was
 a
 process.
 We


were
 really
 we
 were
 really
 close


together.
 It's
 not
 one
 sitting
 there
 and


being
 the
 genius
 and
 having
 producing


ideas
 and
 you
 think
 oh
 my
 god


>> he's
 available
 I
 didn't
 even
 know
 him


he's
 so
 like
 we
 know
 we
 know
 football


players
 it's
 like
 negotiating
 finding


the
 right
 moment
 to
 sell
 finding
 the


right
 moment
 to
 buy
 that's
 a
 sporting


director's
 job
 what
 he
 was
 before
 and


now
 is
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 exactly
 the


role


>> something
 in
 a
 holding
 company
 doing


across
 the
 board
 So
 Richard
 Hughes
 is


now
 there
 doing
 an
 incredible
 job.
 Um
 so


these
 kind
 of
 things
 it's
 it's
 it's


really
 all
 in
 idle
 world.
 So
 like
 people


from
 outside
 are
 idolizing
 sometimes


people
 like
 that
 definitely
 some
 of
 them


with
 me
 and
 they
 do
 with
 Michael
 but


Michael
 never
 did
 a
 job
 alone.
 I
 never


did
 a
 job
 alone.
 Um
 it
 was
 always
 like
 a


a
 really
 good
 Yeah.
 They
 worked
 together


just
 really
 well.
 We
 didn't
 have
 a
 lot


of
 disagreements
 where
 you
 think
 bof


where
 is
 that
 coming
 from?
 Why
 you
 want


him?
 It's
 a
 process
 and
 football
 team
 is


an
 open
 book.
 Everybody
 can
 read
 it


every
 day.
 So
 if
 you
 want
 to
 add


something
 it
 should
 not
 be
 a
 surprise
 to


everybody
 and
 think
 huh
 where's
 that


idea
 coming
 from?
 You
 think
 we
 need
 a


left
 back.
 Why?
 We
 have
 already
 four.


That
 doesn't
 happen.
 you
 are
 it's
 a
 work


on
 progress
 all
 the
 time
 during
 a
 season


but
 the
 transfer
 windows


it
 clash
 obviously
 and
 English
 people
 in


professional
 football
 enjoy
 the
 day
 a


bit
 more
 than
 probably
 in
 other


countries
 um
 so
 that's
 what
 I
 didn't
 get


that
 to
 a
 full
 extent
 but
 um
 I
 learned


um
 a
 lot
 about
 the
 excitement
 of
 a
 good


transfer
 window


>> did
 you
 always
 get
 on
 with
 them


>> yeah
 I
 I
 would
 say
 100%
 and
 Michael


definitely
 and
 Richard,
 I
 don't
 know.
 We


spoke
 quite
 a
 few
 times
 after
 um
 after
 I


left.
 Um
 so
 I
 like
 him.
 So
 and
 I
 think


they
 did
 an
 inc
 they
 did
 an
 incredible


job
 honestly


>> cuz
 you
 became
 bigger
 than
 the
 coach.


You
 you
 became
 such
 a
 huge
 I
 mean
 you


still
 are
 such
 a
 huge
 figure
 in
 the
 in


the
 city.
 I
 mean
 my
 my
 assistant
 who's


been
 with
 me,
 my
 PA
 has
 been
 with
 me
 for


10
 years.
 She's
 from
 Liverpool
 and
 she


I'm
 probably
 going
 to
 embarrass
 her
 now,


but
 you're
 like
 the
 king
 to
 her.
 Not


even
 in
 Liverpool.
 You're
 the
 king


globally


because
 we
 did
 that.
 So
 if
 I
 was
 if
 I


was
 a
 Michael
 Edwards
 or
 someone
 else
 at


the
 club
 and
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 that
 you


have
 you
 had
 ultimate
 power
 kind
 of
 like


Sir
 Alex
 Ferguson
 he
 became


you
 know
 he
 was
 everything.
 He
 is
 the
 st


he's
 on
 the
 stadium.
 He
 is
 the
 club.
 So


I
 I I
 always
 wondered
 how
 anyone
 would


be
 able
 to
 overturn
 your
 opinion
 or


argue
 with
 you
 when
 you
 are
 the
 city.


You're
 like
 you're
 the
 great
 Jurgen
 Klo.


But
 that's
 the
 outside
 world.
 Come
 on.


I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 an
 idiot.
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 sit
 there
 and
 I
 always
 said
 I
 need


other
 people
 to
 understand
 things.
 It's


like
 I
 my
 own
 opin
 opinion.
 I
 know


already.
 I
 know
 the
 morning
 I
 get
 up
 I


know
 my
 opinion.
 So
 come
 on.
 How
 can
 you


get
 a
 better
 view
 on
 it
 on
 things?


That's
 how
 it
 is.
 It's
 just
 by


discussing
 with
 people.
 Yes.
 The
 final


decision
 I
 have
 to
 make
 and
 I
 have
 no


problem
 with
 that.
 But
 for
 that
 I
 need


all
 people
 being
 really
 involved.
 And
 if


you
 want
 to
 have
 an
 argument,
 have
 an


argument.
 In
 the
 end,
 I
 will
 make
 the


decisions.
 Absolutely
 no
 problem.
 Did
 we


have
 argument?
 Maybe
 yes.
 I
 don't


remember
 them.
 But
 it's
 not
 important


because
 it's
 just
 in
 the
 end.
 It's
 it's


about
 the
 outcome.
 It's
 about
 what
 is


best
 for
 the
 club.
 And
 I
 never
 had
 a


problem
 with
 that.
 I
 never
 thought
 they


all
 have
 to
 please
 me.
 So
 I
 realized


how
 famous
 I
 am
 after
 I
 left
 Liverpool.


>> So
 I
 have
 no
 clue.
 I
 was
 never
 in


Liverpool
 out
 there
 on
 on
 the
 bus.
 It's


normal
 that
 the
 people
 cheer
 because
 we


there
 everybody
 is
 they
 cheer
 for


everybody.
 So
 I
 realized
 how
 good
 I
 was


as
 a
 coach
 since
 I'm
 not
 in
 the
 job


anymore.
 So
 because
 I
 thought
 what
 I
 can


do
 everybody
 can
 do.
 I
 realized
 maybe


not.
 So
 it's
 it's
 100%
 the
 truth
 because


in
 the
 job
 you
 just
 do
 try
 to
 sort
 every


day
 the
 things
 in
 front
 of
 you.
 That's


what
 you
 try.


>> Can
 I
 ask
 you
 about
 Nunes?
 He
 he
 didn't


seem
 very
 happy
 on
 your
 last
 your
 last


day.


>> Darwin


>> Darwin.


>> Yeah.
 We
 had
 an
 absolutely
 good


relationship
 as
 good
 as
 can
 be
 with
 a


striker
 is
 not
 scoring
 as
 often
 as
 he


wants
 as
 the
 people
 want
 and
 as
 I
 think


he
 could
 have
 and
 with
 a
 striker
 who


didn't
 play
 as
 often
 as
 definitely
 he


wants.
 So
 how
 can
 you
 have
 a
 fantastic


relationship
 is
 would
 it
 be
 if
 he
 would


would
 I
 don't
 I
 didn't
 see
 that
 picture.


I
 heard
 about
 it.
 If
 he
 would
 have
 stand


there
 and
 be
 the
 number
 one
 and
 jumping


after
 me,
 crying
 his
 eyes
 out
 and
 and


and
 hugging
 me
 for
 10
 minutes,
 I
 was


okay.
 What's
 going
 on
 here?
 It's


completely
 normal
 situation.
 I
 cannot


My
 first
 concern
 cannot
 be
 to
 please


everybody.
 It's
 just
 not
 possible.
 It's


not
 possible
 in
 that
 job.
 You
 have
 easy


the
 first
 problem
 starts
 with
 25


players,
 11
 starting
 positions.
 So
 sorry


more
 players
 are
 not
 happy
 than
 you
 make


happy.
 That's
 that's
 already
 where
 it


starts
 the
 problem.
 So
 now
 you
 have
 to


get
 through
 this.
 And
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 he


had
 super
 moments
 at
 Liverpool.
 We
 had


super
 moments
 together.
 And
 in
 my
 last


day,
 if
 I
 would
 have
 been
 him,
 I
 would


have
 thought
 as
 well,
 okay,
 come
 on,
 the


next
 one
 is
 a
 new
 chance
 for
 me
 because


players
 do
 that.
 If
 if
 it's
 if
 it
 goes


really
 well
 for
 them,
 it's
 not
 that
 they


think
 to
 the
 coach.
 If
 it's
 not
 going


well,
 they
 think
 it's
 okay.
 He
 doesn't


bring
 me
 often
 enough.
 It's
 not
 my


fault.
 Blah
 blah
 blah.
 All
 this
 kind
 of


we
 are
 humans.
 We
 are
 all
 the
 same.


Though
 it's
 not
 that
 they
 are
 special
 in


that
 moment.
 And
 some
 of
 them
 think,


yeah,
 I
 have
 to
 do
 more.
 I
 have
 to
 do


more
 for
 the
 week
 one,
 week
 two,
 week


three.
 And
 I
 think
 now
 I
 did
 three
 weeks


more.
 It's
 still
 not
 pick
 is
 not
 picking


me.
 So
 it's
 this
 it's
 it's
 a
 bit
 you


cannot
 have
 always
 harmony
 and
 and
 and


flowers
 and
 all
 these
 kind
 of
 things.


It's
 a
 competitive
 environment
 and
 you


need
 to
 perform
 to
 get
 what
 you
 think


you
 deserve.


>> When
 did
 you
 decide
 did
 you
 decide
 that


you
 wanted
 to
 sign
 Darwin?
 How
 was
 that?


How
 did
 that
 decision?


>> You
 decide
 exactly
 like
 before
 we


decided
 it
 all
 to
 all
 together
 involved


in
 that
 in
 that
 process
 and
 yes
 that's


how
 it
 is
 nowadays.
 We
 would
 have
 loved


to
 sign
 him
 for
 lesser
 money
 of
 course


but
 it
 was
 in
 that
 moment
 not
 possible.


We
 need
 a
 striker.
 We
 only
 wanted
 to


have
 an
 an
 extra
 like
 an
 extra
 option


for
 striker
 like
 we
 had
 Bobby
 always
 the


best
 false
 nine
 in
 the
 world.
 Yeah.
 And


know
 we
 needed
 somebody
 with
 a
 bit
 more


speed
 and
 stuff
 like
 this.
 We
 need
 the


actions
 more
 and
 and
 Sio
 even
 sure
 if


Sio
 was
 still
 there.
 Probably
 not.
 So


>> Sio
 went
 that
 year.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 so
 went
 that
 year.
 So
 we


had
 to
 we
 had
 to
 change
 as
 well.
 So
 Luis


Diaz
 is
 great.
 Cody
 Gakpo
 great.
 What


kind
 of
 player
 we
 don't
 have?
 I
 thought


Cody
 can
 play
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 Bobby,


good
 football
 on
 the
 side,
 but
 feels


much
 better
 on
 the
 on
 the
 on
 the
 wing.


All
 these
 kind
 of
 things.
 So,
 yeah,
 of


course,
 we
 all
 signed
 him
 together.
 No


problem
 to
 to
 to
 admit
 that
 it
 maybe


didn't
 work
 out
 as
 good
 as
 it
 could,
 but


without
 Darin,
 so
 many
 things
 wouldn't


have
 happened.
 The
 biggest
 comeback
 of


all
 times
 at
 Newcastle,
 for
 example.
 Oh,


I
 love
 that
 day.
 I
 love
 that
 game.
 We


came
 on.
 Yeah.


>> Just

We
 launched
 these
 conversation
 cards
 and


they
 sold
 out.
 And
 we
 launched
 them


again
 and
 they
 sold
 out
 again.
 We


launched
 them
 again
 and
 they
 sold
 out


again
 because
 people
 love
 playing
 these


with
 colleagues
 at
 work,
 with
 friends
 at


home,
 and
 also
 with
 family.
 And
 we've


also
 got
 a
 big
 audience
 that
 use
 them
 as


journal
 prompts.
 Every
 single
 time
 a


guest
 comes
 on
 the
 diary
 of
 a
 CEO,
 they


leave
 a
 question
 for
 the
 next
 guest
 in


the
 diary.
 And
 I've
 sat
 here
 with
 some


of the
 most
 incredible
 people
 in
 the


world.
 And
 they've
 left
 all
 of
 these


questions
 in
 the
 diary.
 And
 I've
 ranked


them
 from
 one
 to
 three
 in
 terms
 of
 the


depth.
 one
 being
 a
 starter
 question.
 And


level
 three,
 if
 you
 look
 on
 the
 back


here,
 this
 is
 a
 level
 three,
 becomes
 a


much
 deeper
 question
 that
 builds
 even


more
 connection.
 If
 you
 turn
 the
 cards


over
 and
 you
 scan
 that
 QR
 code,
 you
 can


see
 who
 answered
 the
 card
 and
 watch
 the


video
 of
 them
 answering
 it
 in
 real
 time.


So,
 if
 you
 would
 like
 to
 get
 your
 hands


on
 some
 of
 these
 conversation
 cards,
 go


to
 the
 diary.com
 or
 look
 at

the

 Why
 did
 you


leave?
 Why
 did
 you
 leave
 Liverpool?
 I
 I


watched
 your
 videos


announcing
 your
 departure
 so
 many
 times


and
 I
 was
 almost
 trying
 to
 read
 between


the
 lines.


>> Oh,


>> I
 was
 trying
 to
 read
 between
 the
 lines.


>> Tell
 me
 what
 you
 read.


>> No,
 I
 was
 just,
 you
 know,
 cuz
 you
 talk


about
 just
 the
 energy,
 not
 having
 the


energy
 for
 it.
 That's
 kind
 of
 how
 I
 was


interpreting
 you.
 You
 know,
 you
 you
 sat


down
 with
 your
 board.
 Your
 board
 talked


about
 plans
 for
 next
 year
 and
 you


realized
 in
 that
 moment
 that


>> you
 didn't
 have
 the
 energy
 to
 rebuild


and
 go
 again,
 etc.


>> No,
 no,
 not
 to
 rebuild


that.
 We
 didn't
 have
 to
 rebuild.
 I
 I


know
 that
 the
 team
 is
 a
 good
 team.
 John,


my
 expectation
 of
 myself
 is
 I'm
 I
 I'm


I'm
 the
 energy
 giver
 to
 everybody
 in
 in


this
 environment.
 Like
 that's
 what
 I


what
 my
 if
 somebody
 struggle,
 come
 on,


you
 can
 have
 my
 don't
 need
 it.
 Let's
 go.


I
 have
 to
 be
 on
 top
 of
 absolute
 top
 of


my
 game
 to
 be
 the
 guy
 who
 deserves
 to
 be


the
 Liverpool
 manager.
 And
 that's
 what
 I


said
 when
 I
 said
 day
 when
 I
 feel
 huh
 I


know
 that
 anymore
 then
 I
 don't
 so
 that
 I


say
 okay
 let's
 wait
 until
 everybody
 sees


it
 and
 then
 they
 can
 give
 me
 the
 sec
 and


la
 all
 these
 kind
 of
 things
 I
 cannot
 do


it
 like
 that
 not
 after
 the
 time
 we
 had


together
 I
 realized
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be


that
 after
 all
 the
 time
 we
 had
 together


I
 want
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 the
 guy
 I


don't
 want
 to
 go
 on
 tour
 to
 USA
 but
 why


because
 was
 I
 loved
 it
 all
 every
 day
 so


it's
 then
 you
 realize
 I
 need
 a
 break,


whatever.
 I
 need
 to
 have
 something
 else.


And
 you
 cannot
 do
 that
 in
 that
 business.


You
 cannot
 say,
 "Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,


give
 me
 a
 year.
 See
 you
 later."


>> And
 it's
 just
 not
 like
 that.
 And
 I


really
 think
 we
 we
 we
 did
 what
 we
 had
 to


do
 to
 to
 to
 say
 what
 we
 felt
 and
 thought


in
 that
 moment.
 And
 was
 exactly
 like


that.
 I
 didn't
 have
 the
 energy
 to
 think


about
 what's
 what's
 next.
 I
 didn't
 want


to
 think
 about
 what's
 next.
 I
 just


wanted
 to
 to
 go.
 I
 was
 happy
 with


finishing
 the
 season.
 But
 then
 don't
 ask


me
 what
 can
 we
 do
 here,
 what
 can
 we
 do


there,
 what
 can
 it
 was
 all
 my


responsibility
 for
 all
 the
 time
 because


yes
 I
 don't
 decide
 money
 but
 all
 the


rest
 it
 was
 in
 my
 hands
 from
 a
 specific


moment
 on.
 COVID
 kicked
 in.
 No
 sporting


director
 Michael
 came
 after
 I
 after
 I


left.
 It
 was
 not
 there
 anymore
 and
 not


it
 was
 not
 because
 we
 had
 a
 problem
 or


whatever.
 Not
 at
 all.
 Um
 it
 was
 just


they
 wanted
 to
 find
 a
 leader
 for
 the
 for


the
 pack
 and
 founded
 with
 Michael
 and


and
 and
 Richard
 and
 Anna
 obviously
 now


working
 really
 close
 together.
 So
 that


what
 was
 the
 was
 the
 decision
 but
 there


was
 a
 time
 there
 was
 no
 Richard,
 no


Michael,
 no
 Julian
 Ward.
 So
 there
 was


just
 me
 sitting
 there
 um
 like
 on
 top
 of


all
 the
 the
 things
 and
 we
 had
 to
 win


football
 games
 but
 all
 the
 rest
 was
 on


my
 plate
 as
 well.
 It
 was
 an
 intense


time.


>> There
 wasn't
 a
 structure
 around
 you
 in


that
 regard.


>> Co
 changed
 a
 lot.
 I
 mean,
 people
 didn't


fly
 as
 much
 anymore.
 Um,
 the
 owners


didn't
 come
 that
 often
 over.
 It
 was
 like


budget
 calls
 were
 on
 the
 phone.
 Uh,
 more


or
 less.
 We
 brought
 in
 Jük,
 the
 Germans


for
 because
 we
 didn't
 have
 a
 sporting


director
 at
 that
 time.
 In
 fact,
 Julian


came
 back,
 but
 then
 um
 I
 don't
 even
 know


exactly
 why
 why
 he
 left
 again.
 So
 the


these
 kind
 of
 things
 that
 just
 happened


and
 the
 only
 guys
 who
 were
 always
 there


were
 we
 the
 coaches
 and
 the
 football


team.
 So
 they
 were
 just
 the
 normal
 stuff


over
 a
 day.
 So
 who
 was
 doing
 the


sporting
 director
 stuff?


>> Yeah
 us
 and
 together
 with
 in
 that
 one
 in


that
 one
 window
 with
 I
 think
 it
 was
 with


the
 German
 guy
 we
 brought
 over.
 I
 don't


even
 know
 if
 Julian
 Ward
 was
 still
 there


the
 lawyers
 the
 scouts.
 So,
 um,


>> do
 you
 think
 you
 could
 ever
 go
 back
 and


manage
 Liverpool
 again?
 Is
 that
 within


the
 realm
 of
 possibilities?


>> I
 said
 I
 will
 never
 coach
 another
 team,


a
 different
 team
 in
 in
 England.
 So,
 that


means
 if
 then
 it's
 Liverpool.


Yeah.
 So,
 yeah,
 theoretically
 it's


possible.


>> What
 would
 it
 take
 theoretically
 for
 you


to
 want
 to
 do
 that
 psychologically?


>> I
 don't
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 exactly.
 I


just
 there
 must
 be


I
 I
 love
 what
 I
 do
 right
 now.
 I
 don't


miss
 coaching.
 I
 don't
 I
 mean
 I
 do
 coach


but
 just
 different
 not
 not
 players.
 So


and
 I
 don't
 miss
 it.
 I
 don't
 miss


standing
 in
 the
 rain
 two
 and
 a
 half,


three
 hours.
 Um,
 and
 and
 I
 don't
 miss


going
 to
 press
 conference


four
 times,
 three
 times
 a
 week,
 having


12,
 10,
 12
 interviews
 a
 week.
 I
 don't


miss
 that.
 I
 don't.
 So


I


don't
 miss
 being
 in
 the
 dressing
 room


like
 in
 a
 sense
 of
 that
 I
 didn't
 have
 it


often
 other
 I
 coach
 180
 something
 games


so
 I
 was
 in
 a
 dress
 room
 very
 very
 often


and
 I
 don't
 want
 to


die
 in
 a
 dressing
 room
 just
 because
 so


nice
 it
 smells
 so
 it's
 it's it's
 these


kind
 of
 things
 so
 but
 there
 might
 be


something
 I'm
 58
 that's
 from
 your


perspective
 old
 from
 other
 perspective


from
 the
 other
 side
 it's
 not
 that
 old


that
 means
 I
 could
 make
 the
 decision
 in


a
 few
 years.
 I
 don't
 know.
 Do
 I
 have
 to


make
 the
 decision
 today?
 I
 will
 not


coach
 again.
 But
 thank
 God
 I
 don't
 have


to
 do
 that.
 I
 can
 just
 see
 what
 future


brings.
 But
 now
 I'm
 involved
 in
 a


project
 I
 really
 love
 and
 I
 love
 the


people
 I'm
 working
 together
 with
 and
 the


clubs
 we
 are
 responsible
 for
 and
 the


countries
 the
 clubs
 are
 in.
 So
 I
 like


doing
 what
 I'm
 doing
 right
 now.


And
 in
 my
 mind,


only
 if
 I'm
 focused
 100%
 on
 it,
 I
 can
 do


it
 really
 good.
 And
 that's
 what
 I
 always


wanted
 to
 do
 to
 do.


>> Those
 are
 the
 things
 you
 don't
 miss.


What
 do
 you
 miss?


>> Some
 sometimes
 people.
 So
 yeah,


sometimes
 I
 miss
 people.
 like


I
 I
 I
 I
 wish
 I
 so
 that's
 I
 don't
 miss
 a


dressing
 room
 as
 a
 dressing
 room
 but


sitting
 there
 in
 the
 restaurant
 with
 the


players
 and
 having
 a
 nice
 chat
 that
 it's


nice
 it
 was
 always
 nice
 when
 they
 were


just
 in
 a
 good
 mood.
 We
 won
 a
 lot
 of


games
 and
 so
 like
 there
 was
 often
 a
 very


good
 mood
 in
 in
 the
 building


and
 standing
 there
 hearing
 them
 laugh
 I


I
 still
 have
 virtual
 laugh
 in
 my
 ear
 for


example.
 Yes.
 this
 kind
 this
 part
 of
 the


of
 the
 job
 it
 is
 obviously


but
 that's
 for
 these
 players
 which
 I
 had


the
 last
 time
 it's
 now
 um
 do
 I
 miss
 it


in
 general
 with
 football
 players
 not


right
 now
 it's
 not
 like
 that
 but
 I
 there


is
 there's
 really
 not
 a
 lot
 to
 be
 honest


what
 I
 miss
 because
 I'm
 still


in
 the
 business
 I
 I
 I
 know
 most
 about
 so


the
 football
 part
 I
 don't
 miss
 because
 I


have
 it
 and
 the
 The
 thing
 is
 like
 don't


have
 to
 be
 outside.
 I'm
 not
 the
 guy
 in


the
 chair
 before
 a
 game
 and
 stuff
 like


this.
 No,
 I
 I
 honestly
 that's
 that's


probably
 the
 best.
 I
 don't
 miss


anything.
 That's
 how
 it
 is.


>> When
 I
 look
 at
 your
 career,
 minds
 of


Dortmund,
 Liverpool,
 you
 seem
 to
 always


be
 successful
 and
 it's
 it's
 extremely


rare.
 It's
 extremely
 rare
 and
 you
 seem


to
 always
 succeed
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 passion


and
 all
 those
 things.
 But
 my
 question
 is


I
 think
 about
 the
 audience
 we
 have
 which


are
 often
 business
 people,
 leaders,


CEOs.
 Is
 there
 anything
 else
 that
 we


haven't
 touched
 upon
 that
 is
 central
 to


your
 idea
 of
 getting
 the
 best
 out
 of
 a


group
 of
 people?
 We
 talked
 about
 being
 a


sort
 of
 bespoke
 leader,
 being
 the
 jigsaw


piece
 you
 need
 to
 be
 to
 get
 the
 best
 out


of
 a
 person.
 We
 talked
 about
 giving


everything.
 Is
 there
 anything
 else


that's
 really
 central
 to
 your
 philosophy


of
 leadership
 and
 management
 that
 you


think
 is
 important
 that
 we
 haven't


touched
 upon
 yet
 that
 young
 coaches


might
 be
 able
 to


create
 the
 best
 team


possible.


And
 I
 mean
 in
 an
 understandable
 team


like
 really
 there's
 there
 must
 be
 a


reason
 why
 this
 team
 wins
 and
 not
 the


other
 team
 because
 there
 are
 other
 teams


out
 there.
 They
 try
 absolutely


everything.
 So
 don't
 waste
 time
 with


walking
 next
 to
 each
 other,
 not
 knowing


anything
 about
 each
 other,
 not
 being


bothered
 about
 the
 problems
 of
 each


other,
 not
 being
 interested
 about
 each


other.
 No,
 no,
 no.
 I
 want
 to
 grow


together.
 And
 it
 was
 my
 job
 to
 help
 them


to
 grow
 to
 create
 situation
 where
 they


could
 do
 that
 to
 make
 sure
 and
 if
 I
 had


to
 be
 harsh
 to
 all
 of
 them
 that
 they


found
 a
 way
 to
 get
 together.
 I
 did
 that.


It
 was
 not
 what
 I
 said.
 It
 was
 what
 they


needed
 to
 understand
 why
 we
 are
 a
 very


special
 team
 in
 a
 very


hard
 and
 difficult
 competition.
 But
 we


have
 to
 find
 a
 reason
 why
 we
 deserve
 it


more
 than
 others.
 Yes.
 That's
 what
 I


what
 I
 say
 what
 you
 have
 to
 do
 and


that's
 what
 I
 people
 want
 to
 convince


today
 with
 knowledge
 they
 want
 to
 say
 I


know
 everything
 about
 that
 look
 I
 can


tell
 you
 I
 can
 explain
 it
 to
 you
 sir
 but


it's
 in
 the
 end
 that's
 one
 thing
 and


other
 people
 can
 know
 as
 well
 it's
 about


how
 close
 can
 we
 really
 grow
 together
 to


go
 out
 there
 and
 smash
 the
 whatever
 out


of
 them
 so
 that's
 the
 that's
 the
 the
 the


thing
 what
 what
 what
 I
 wanted
 to
 what
 I


always
 did
 so
 it
 was
 always


for
 us
 we
 would
 walk
 I
 don't
 know
 we


would
 go
 through
 fire
 I'm
 not
 sure
 if


you
 say
 that
 any
 but
 we
 really
 would
 do


absolutely
 everything
 and
 without
 me


telling
 every
 day
 to
 find
 it
 so
 to
 find


a
 way
 to
 grow
 as
 much
 together
 that
 was


obvious


>> how
 do
 I
 get
 people
 to
 walk
 through
 fire


so
 you're
 talking
 about
 making
 sure
 the


bonds
 amongst
 themselves
 are
 strong
 I


heard
 stories
 of
 you
 making
 sure


everybody
 knew
 everybody's
 name
 when
 you


first
 arrived
 and
 things
 like
 that


>> not
 players
 it
 was
 staff


>> the
 staff
 names
 etc


What
 were
 you
 doing
 to
 get
 people
 to


walk
 through
 fire?


>> And
 that's
 exactly
 that's
 exact
 that's
 a


good
 question.
 There's
 no
 answer
 for
 the


question
 because
 it
 means
 that
 would


mean
 you
 say
 you
 say
 one
 thing
 and
 well


everybody
 runs.
 That's
 not
 like
 that.


You
 have
 to
 create
 a
 culture
 an an


environment
 a
 situation
 uh
 a
 wbee
 where


everybody
 realize
 this
 is
 special.
 The


underlining
 message
 is
 this
 is
 special


and
 now
 let's
 go
 for
 it.
 This
 is
 worth


it.
 This
 it
 means
 really
 more
 to
 all
 of


us
 that
 we
 really
 can
 fight
 more
 for
 it.


>> What
 is
 special?


>> The
 togetherness.
 The
 way
 we
 we
 had
 we


we
 the
 way
 we
 and
 that
 people
 can
 say


that's
 in
 our
 club
 the
 same
 but
 the
 way


we
 interacted
 in
 the
 training
 ground


with
 the
 kitchen
 stuff
 with
 with
 the


respect
 we
 we
 showed
 every
 day
 with
 the


kidmen
 with
 the
 gardeners
 with
 all
 the


people
 there
 there.
 That
 was
 for
 me
 most


important
 because
 it
 just
 you
 just


realize
 that's
 the
 the
 respect
 you
 show


is
 the
 respect
 you
 get.
 You
 can
 show


respect
 you
 don't
 deserve
 any.
 So
 that's


how
 it
 is
 and
 you
 don't
 have
 it's
 not
 a


lesson
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 that
 I
 tell
 you


wait
 sit
 here.
 You
 have
 to
 respect
 the


gardener
 and
 then
 the
 other
 people
 will


respect
 you
 as
 well.
 It's
 a
 you
 don't
 do


it
 like
 that.
 It's
 just
 you
 learn
 that


show
 respect
 you
 get
 respect.
 Don't
 show


respect
 you
 don't
 deserve
 it.
 So
 all


these
 little
 things
 over
 there,
 there's


not
 a
 big
 thing.
 It's
 not
 that
 every
 day


I
 go
 for
 them
 and
 tell
 them
 why
 is
 this


different,
 why
 is
 that
 different.
 The


way
 you
 deal
 with
 situations,
 we
 found
 a


way
 for
 us


that
 the
 most
 important
 information


about
 the
 game
 was
 what
 I
 said
 and
 not


was
 in
 the
 media,
 not
 was
 in
 social


media.
 When
 I
 said
 it
 was
 good,
 it
 was


good.
 There
 was
 still
 all
 the
 things
 out


there
 were
 written
 but
 that
 were
 not


important
 anymore.
 When
 I
 said
 it
 was


not
 good,
 then
 could
 they
 write?
 Yeah,


but
 you
 won
 3
 and0
 and
 then
 we
 found
 a


way
 to
 talk
 about
 it
 and
 and
 worked
 on


it.
 We
 created
 our
 own
 world
 in
 that


time
 which
 was
 more
 important
 than
 the


outside
 world.


>> How
 is
 not
 being
 respectful
 to
 the


gardener
 going
 to
 lose
 you
 the
 Champions


League?
 What
 is
 the
 the
 through
 line?


>> I
 believe
 just
 in
 if
 you
 cannot
 do
 that,


if
 you
 don't
 appreciate
 what
 thing
 what


what
 other
 people
 do,
 then
 you
 cannot


appreciate
 what
 your
 teammate
 is
 doing.


If
 you
 don't
 that's
 just
 a
 little
 sign.


It's
 not
 that
 of
 course
 there's
 not


direct
 impact
 from
 here
 to
 there,
 but
 in


the
 end
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 if
 you
 would


really
 have
 a
 a
 brief
 look
 at
 it
 in
 one


or
 two
 situations


like


>> oh
 he
 doesn't
 look
 like
 a
 proper
 fella


and
 then
 you
 go
 back
 to
 to
 the
 to
 the


beginning
 would
 say
 yeah
 because
 he


isn't.
 I
 can
 tell
 you


>> I'm
 fascinated
 by
 this
 point
 because


when
 I
 was
 um
 when
 I
 was
 at
 Old
 Trafford


and
 the
 ladies
 who
 served
 the
 food
 in


the
 l
 in
 the
 boxes
 and
 lounges
 when
 I


would
 ask
 them
 what
 was
 different
 after


Fergie
 left
 the
 thing
 they
 kept
 saying


to
 me
 was
 oh
 it's
 just
 so
 different


around
 here
 and
 I'd
 say
 explain
 to
 me


how
 they
 go
 I
 don't
 know
 just
 he


Ferguson
 just
 knew
 our
 names.
 Yeah,


>> that's
 what
 they
 would
 say.
 And
 it's
 a


strange
 thing
 to
 hear
 that
 the
 only


symptom
 that
 some
 of
 the
 staff
 in
 the


stadium
 could
 point
 at
 was
 just
 the
 new


leadership
 don't
 know
 our
 names.


>> Yeah,
 but
 this
 is
 obviously
 not
 the


answer
 to
 the
 Man
 United
 problems.


That's
 just
 the
 situation
 with
 the
 the


ladies
 or
 whoever
 working
 in
 that
 in


that
 area.
 But
 it
 shows
 if
 that
 doesn't


then
 you
 don't
 know
 theoretically
 the


names.
 What
 it
 shows
 is
 the
 togetherness


is
 not
 there
 anymore.
 It
 starts
 already


with
 a
 sex
 was
 just
 different
 and
 then


you
 y
 but
 not
 on
 day
 one


>> but
 after
 23
 years
 of
 course
 he
 was


different
 of
 course
 he
 knew
 your
 name
 he


saw
 you
 growing
 up
 so
 how
 can
 you


compare
 that


>> this
 was
 under
 Edward
 just
 for
 the


context
 this
 wasn't
 under
 any
 am
 this


was
 before
 then
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 ago


>> and
 I
 just
 always
 found
 that
 to
 for
 me


that
 as
 a
 business
 leader
 became
 a


really
 interesting
 reference
 point


because
 it
 as
 you
 said
 it's
 just
 a


downstream
 symptom
 of
 something
 where


the
 club
 has
 gone
 from
 feeling
 like
 a


family
 and
 special
 and
 you
 know
 close


and
 tight
 and
 these
 values
 to
 the
 decay


of
 the
 values
 and
 it's
 and
 all
 the
 way


down
 to
 the
 the
 stream
 at
 the
 bottom


>> but
 this
 is
 this
 is
 a
 generation


discussion
 isn't
 it
 like
 in
 the
 past


again
 I'm
 not
 that
 old
 that
 I
 say
 in
 the


past
 everything
 was
 better
 for
 sure
 not


but
 we
 are
 differently


raised
 that's
 how
 it
 is
 I
 came
 home
 I


walked
 home
 in
 a
 1,200
 00
 people


village.
 I
 had
 a
 400
 meter
 walk
 from
 the


bus
 station
 to
 my
 home.
 I
 walked
 home.


Obviously,
 a
 lady
 crossed
 my
 way.
 I


didn't
 can
 remember
 it.
 I
 arrived
 at


home
 after
 200
 m
 more
 meters.
 And
 then


my
 mom
 said,
 "Why
 you
 didn't
 say
 hello


to
 Mrs.
 and
 so
 uh


what?"


So
 that
 does
 does
 that
 help
 me
 in
 life?


I'm
 not
 sure.
 It's
 just
 how
 you
 get
 it's


just
 how
 you
 get
 raised.
 I
 didn't
 run


back
 and
 say
 sorry
 hello
 but
 next
 time


believe
 me
 it
 leaded
 so
 in
 my
 life
 where


everybody
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 recognize
 me


so
 difficult
 not
 to
 say
 hello
 to
 people


because
 of
 that
 but
 I
 start
 obviously


getting
 attention
 if
 I
 can't
 get
 through


something
 and
 I
 would
 say
 hello
 that


doesn't
 work
 properly
 for
 me
 anymore
 but


it's
 still
 in
 me
 one
 thing
 is
 the
 things


we
 read
 the
 other
 thing
 is
 the
 things
 we


feel
 the
 other
 thing
 is
 is
 the
 how
 we


get
 treated
 we
 all
 are
 the
 result
 of
 a


lot
 of
 things
 what
 happened
 to
 us
 and
 as


long
 as
 we
 are
 together
 let's
 make
 sure


that
 we
 influence
 each
 other
 as
 positive


as
 somehow
 possible
 and
 let's
 see
 where


it
 leads
 us
 to
 that's
 the
 idea
 I
 have


>> a
 lot
 of
 managers
 or
 leaders
 or
 CEOs


would
 focus
 on
 tactics
 and
 strategy


first
 and
 foremost
 and
 as
 you
 say
 the


information
 and
 all
 those
 things
 but
 it


appears
 that
 you
 focus
 somewhere
 else


>> not
 first
 same
 time
 it's
 not
 first
 it's


not
 same
 time
 it's
 it's
 same
 time
 I
 24


hours
 a
 day,
 2
 hours
 time
 for
 training.


There's
 not
 a
 lot
 more
 you
 can
 do.
 Maybe


you
 have
 another
 in
 the
 preseason


definitely
 more
 another
 session
 2
 hours


4
 hours
 20
 hours
 left
 7
 8
 hours
 sleep
 12


more
 hours.
 Welcome.
 What
 can
 we
 do
 with


that?
 That's
 become
 the
 best
 group
 we


can
 be.
 So
 that's
 I'm
 100%
 interested


in.
 Definitely


>> the
 best
 group
 we
 can
 be.


>> Yeah.


>> That's
 those
 relationships,
 those


values.


>> Yeah.
 And
 were
 there
 any
 particular


changes
 you
 made
 to
 how
 the
 team


interacted
 with
 each
 other?
 I
 know
 that


um
 the
 Inos
 guys
 told
 me
 at
 Manchester


like
 they've
 changed
 the
 like
 canteen
 so


that
 people
 don't
 sit
 on
 separate
 tables


now
 and
 the
 team
 are
 together
 when
 they


eat.
 Just
 small
 things
 like
 this
 that


some
 people
 might
 think
 are


inconsequential.
 Are
 there
 any
 things


that
 you
 changed?


Any
 rules
 or
 policies?


>> I
 don't
 like
 these
 obvious
 things
 too


much.


If
 you
 don't
 like
 each
 other


and
 the
 size
 of
 the
 table
 makes
 no


difference
 to
 be
 honest.
 I
 don't
 say


that's
 not
 important.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


see
 them
 the
 real
 effect.
 I
 I
 want
 to


reach
 it
 in
 a
 different
 way.


I
 want
 to
 to
 introduce
 them
 to
 each


other
 in
 a
 specific
 way
 on
 the
 pitch.
 By


the
 way,
 that's
 where
 it
 starts
 because


we
 are
 football
 team.
 we
 are
 not
 a


community
 and
 just
 sit
 there
 and
 drink


tea
 and
 and
 eat
 biscuits.
 It's
 a
 it's
 a


real
 competitive
 environment
 and
 it's


all
 to
 get
 the
 best
 out
 of
 the
 boys
 on


the
 football
 pitch.
 So,


rules,
 pitch,
 rules,
 dressing
 room,
 but


then
 there's
 so
 many
 things
 left
 and


right
 of
 the
 rules.
 There's
 so
 many


things
 you
 can
 do
 together.
 There's
 so


much
 to
 talk
 about,
 so
 much
 to
 know


about.
 And
 that's
 what
 life
 is.


Otherwise,
 we
 just
 live
 next
 to
 each


other
 and
 we
 don't
 benefit
 from
 each


other.
 That
 makes
 no
 sense.
 I
 don't
 want


to
 make
 it
 bigger
 than
 it
 is,
 but
 my


general
 understanding
 from
 football
 team


is
 to
 become
 the
 best
 football
 team
 you


can
 be.
 This
 is
 the
 this
 is
 as
 important


as
 tactics.
 As
 important
 as
 tactics.


They
 can
 have
 the
 best
 tactics
 and
 the


guys
 don't
 respect,
 don't
 like
 each


other,
 nobody
 will
 see
 them
 ever.
 Ever.


So,
 if
 the
 worst
 tactics,
 but
 they
 love


each
 other,
 boy,
 they
 still
 can
 win.


That's
 possible.


Isle
 world
 great
 team


good
 coach
 you
 have
 a
 good
 chance
 to
 be


successful


>> I
 have
 I
 have
 two
 pictures
 that
 we


haven't
 shown
 yet
 but
 this
 this


particular
 picture
 is
 of
 Elizabeth


>> mama


>> your
 mama


>> yeah


2011
 we
 became
 champion
 with
 Dortmund
 my


home
 club
 as
 gladen
 invited
 me
 build
 a


stage


my
 elder
 sister
 wrote
 a
 poem.


My
 mom
 couldn't
 have
 been
 prouder.


Obviously,


uh
 that
 day
 I
 saw
 my
 teammates
 from
 my


first
 football
 team.
 They
 were
 all


there.
 Nobody
 would
 have
 thought
 that


somebody
 from
 there
 would
 arrive
 where
 I


was
 there.


Yeah,
 great
 day.
 Lisbet
 was
 a
 really


really
 nice
 woman,
 I
 have
 to
 say.


She
 she
 passed
 away
 in
 2021
 um
 after


falling
 ill
 because
 of
 everything
 that


was
 going
 on
 at
 the
 time
 with
 the


pandemic.
 You
 weren't
 able
 to
 attend
 her


funeral
 because
 of
 the
 travel


restrictions
 and
 all
 those
 kinds
 of


things.


She
 did
 get
 to
 see
 your
 your
 success.


She
 got
 to
 see
 that's
 a
 big
 difference.


So
 I
 was
 not
 in
 a
 funeral
 and
 that
 was


the
 the
 sounds
 crazy.
 The
 online
 funeral


was
 one
 of
 the
 saddest
 things
 I
 I


experienced
 in
 my
 life.
 Uh,
 but
 they


made
 it
 happen.
 At least
 that
 was
 good


that
 we
 could
 see
 it,
 that
 we
 could
 be


part
 of
 it.
 We
 couldn't
 be
 there.


My
 mom
 had
 in
 the
 end
 had
 dementia.
 So,


it's
 not
 that
 she
 would
 have
 known
 that


I
 was
 not
 there
 when
 she
 was
 lying


there.
 She
 was
 that
 that's
 a
 not
 a
 nice


thing,
 but
 she
 saw
 the
 maturity
 of


my
 working
 life
 if
 you
 want.
 My
 dad


didn't
 see
 my
 coaching
 life.
 So
 that's


is
 the
 there's
 no
 nothing
 is
 perfect.


But
 mom
 was
 was
 super
 happy
 was
 a
 very


happy
 lady
 until
 she


could
 remember
 us
 and
 see
 us
 and
 um


recognize
 us


and
 the
 time
 when
 he
 could
 when
 she


couldn't
 do
 that
 anymore.
 Yeah.
 Was
 not


too
 long.
 But
 that's
 a
 can't
 wait
 for


the
 day
 when
 somebody
 finds
 a
 solution


for
 these
 kind
 of
 things
 uh
 for
 these


kind
 of
 diseases
 and
 um


because
 in
 your
 age
 obviously
 don't


think
 about
 it
 but
 if
 you
 come
 older


they
 think
 who
 dies
 today
 just
 of
 a


heart
 attack
 and
 not
 by
 having
 already


dementia
 or
 or
 stuff
 like
 this
 and
 don't


recognize
 the
 kids
 anymore
 and
 stuff


like
 this.
 You
 don't
 want
 that.


You
 just
 can't
 get
 through
 this
 by


ignoring
 the
 fact
 and
 hoping
 that


science
 will
 find
 a
 way
 until
 we
 get


there.


>> Yeah.


>> She
 she
 started
 to
 lose
 her
 her
 memories


of
 her
 family
 because
 of
 dementia.


>> Yeah.
 So
 like
 the
 normal
 things
 on
 phone


she
 didn't
 know
 recognize
 my
 voice


first.


said
 that
 this
 is
 a
 this
 is
 a
 strange


strange
 disease
 or
 whatever
 how
 you
 will


call
 it.
 It
 closed
 so
 many
 doors
 and


opens
 others.
 It's
 a
 long
 time
 memory.


Incredible.
 She
 recognized
 ladies
 in
 the


street.
 They
 were
 together
 in
 primary


school
 stuff
 like
 this
 but
 didn't
 know


who
 we
 were.
 So
 just
 these
 kind
 of


things.
 It's
 not
 it's
 not
 a
 competition


of
 things
 you
 you
 forget
 or
 whatever.


There
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 you
 forget
 and


especially
 for
 the
 people
 and
 that
 was


my
 sisters
 who
 took
 care
 of
 her


obviously
 that's
 not
 nice
 if
 she
 don't


recognize
 you
 who
 are
 you
 go
 away
 these


things
 how
 is
 that
 to
 deal
 how
 is
 that


to
 deal
 with
 as
 a
 family
 member
 when


someone
 you
 love
 a
 parent
 can
 no
 longer


recognize
 who
 you
 are
 you
 it's
 almost


like
 a
 it
 sounds
 like
 a
 grief
 heartbreak


>> yeah
 I
 think
 obviously
 my
 my
 sisters


were
 around
 um
 so
 For
 them
 was
 harder
 of


course
 because
 they
 were
 around.
 For
 me


it
 was
 not
 a
 problem
 at
 all
 because
 I


knew
 she
 loved
 me
 more
 than
 our
 own


life.
 In
 a
 moment
 she
 can
 recognize
 me


anymore
 that
 it
 was
 not
 a
 problem
 for


me.
 I
 just
 felt
 for
 her
 that
 is
 that
 is


really
 that
 it's
 really
 so
 that's
 so


hard.
 Must
 be
 so
 hard.
 If
 you
 have


bright
 moments
 where
 oh
 I
 know
 oh
 my
 god


you
 are
 here
 but what
 are
 you
 doing


here?
 and
 then
 going
 again.
 It's
 it's


really
 it's
 really
 not
 nice
 and
 I
 I
 I
 I


really
 sincerely
 hope
 that
 we
 find
 um


yeah
 medication
 for
 that.
 I
 think


science
 is
 in
 a
 yeah
 in
 a
 good
 way
 but


still
 a
 a
 long
 way
 to
 go
 but
 thanks
 for


this
 picture.
 I
 don't
 I
 have
 it
 on
 my


phone
 somewhere
 but
 I
 don't
 have
 it
 as
 a


yeah
 thank
 you
 very
 much.


>> Faith
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 your
 life
 as


well.


>> Yeah.


>> Your
 belief
 in
 God.


>> Yeah.


And
 from
 what
 I
 understood,
 that's
 not


always
 been
 the
 case.
 When
 you
 were
 a


younger
 man,
 you
 weren't


religious
 in
 the
 same
 way
 that
 you
 are


now.
 Is
 that
 accurate
 or


>> I
 won't
 even
 say
 I'm
 religious.
 I
 I


believe


>> but
 I
 don't
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 100%
 what


religious
 means
 to
 be
 100%
 honest.
 But


it's
 um
 this
 lady,
 my
 mom
 um
 prayed


every
 night
 before
 going
 to
 bed.
 But


problem


one
 thing
 we
 prayed
 the
 other
 thing
 she


said
 because
 she
 couldn't
 be
 hard
 with


me.
 She
 could
 she
 just
 had
 no
 weapons.


the
 only
 thing
 she
 could
 say,
 "Don't


forget
 if
 you
 do
 that
 again,
 I
 will
 have


to
 tell
 the
 dad
 at
 the
 weekend
 when
 he's


coming
 back."
 So,
 it
 was
 like
 the
 only


threat
 she
 had,
 the
 only
 weapon
 she
 she


carried
 around.
 Um,
 and
 I
 obviously
 was


smart
 enough
 to
 realize
 that
 whatever
 I


did,
 she
 never
 told
 my
 dad.
 Um,


um,
 from
 time
 that
 I
 went
 to
 church,
 I


had
 a
 a
 short
 spell
 where
 I
 thought


because
 Sunday
 morning
 church
 was
 when
 I


played
 games.
 I
 have
 to
 go
 to
 church.


I'm
 not
 I
 cannot
 play
 football
 anymore.


But
 that
 lasted
 exactly
 one
 game.
 So
 one


Sunday
 they
 thought
 God
 cannot
 be
 that


hard.
 He
 cannot
 think
 that
 I
 have
 to
 go


to
 church
 when
 I
 love
 football
 so
 much.


It
 cannot
 that's
 it
 cannot
 be
 like
 that.


Um
 and
 he
 isn't
 I'm
 pretty
 sure.
 So
 um


yeah
 I
 found
 my
 way.
 For
 me
 it's
 for
 me


it's


to
 live
 together.
 We
 have
 to
 make
 sure


that
 we
 that
 we
 don't
 think
 the
 only


thing
 what
 is
 interesting
 is
 my
 own


well-being.
 We
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we


really
 understand
 being
 alone
 in
 a
 good


position
 doesn't
 help.
 Yes,
 it's


completely
 normal
 that
 we
 all
 try


to
 get
 as
 far
 as
 we
 can
 in
 our
 career,


in
 our
 life
 and
 all
 these
 kind
 of


things.
 But
 it's
 really
 important
 that


we
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 that
 we
 really
 try


to
 to
 work
 properly
 together,
 to
 live


properly
 together
 and
 all
 these
 kind
 of


things.
 For
 me,
 this
 is
 my
 faith.
 It's


based
 on
 my
 this
 this


understanding
 is
 based
 on
 my
 faith.
 So


and
 and
 common
 sense
 obviously
 and


that's
 the
 way
 I
 believe
 and
 um
 I
 think


that's
 the
 best
 thing
 you
 can
 say
 about


religion
 when
 it's
 like
 that
 that
 it


keeps
 people


in
 a
 good
 place.
 If
 religion
 can't
 do


that
 then
 that's
 not
 the
 right
 religion


for
 me.
 So
 it's
 really
 about
 that
 we


have
 to
 be
 tolerant.
 We
 have
 to.
 It's
 no


problem.
 It's
 a
 wonderful
 planet.
 It's
 a


wonderful
 world
 we
 are
 living
 in.
 But


it's
 not
 for
 one
 or
 two.
 It's
 for
 all
 of


us.
 And
 we
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 that


works
 out.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 right
 faith


can
 help
 you
 with
 that.
 But
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 know
 what
 is
 the
 right
 way.
 I
 only


know
 what
 is
 for
 me.
 So
 yeah,
 for
 me


it's
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do.
 And
 I
 never


doubted
 it
 to
 be
 honest
 with
 all
 the


information
 you
 get
 over
 in
 life.


God
 is
 real
 for
 me
 and
 um
 and
 Jesus
 of


course.
 Um
 yeah.


>> What
 goals
 have
 you
 got
 left
 to


accomplish,
 Jurgen?
 What
 what's
 what
 is


left
 on
 your
 list,
 if
 anything
 at
 all?


Because
 you've
 got
 You're
 right.
 You're


probably
 halfway
 through
 your
 life,
 the


way
 things
 are
 going
 in
 terms
 of
 people,


the
 life
 expectancy
 increasing.


>> Halfway
 through
 116.
 We
 have
 the
 next


podcast.
 Yeah.


>> I
 want
 to
 travel.
 That's
 what
 we're


doing.
 Start
 now.
 I
 want
 to
 be
 together


with
 Ola
 as
 much
 as
 we
 can.
 But
 not
 not


that
 much
 that
 she
 or
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be


around
 each
 other
 anymore
 because
 I


really
 think
 you
 see
 people
 and
 think


what
 is
 your
 husband
 doing?
 Oh,
 he's
 at


home.
 Oh
 god.
 So
 no
 no no
 I'm
 not
 that


but
 I'm
 very
 busy.
 So
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 lot


away.
 So
 that's
 fine.
 But
 I
 want
 to


spend
 with
 her
 with
 the
 kids
 with
 the


grandkids.
 I
 don't
 have
 this
 kind
 of


ambitions.
 I
 want
 to
 do
 really
 well
 for


Red
 Bull.
 Really
 well.
 I
 I
 I
 feel


already
 responsible
 for
 all
 the
 people
 I


work
 together
 with.
 That's
 a


very
 interesting
 thing
 for
 me.
 I
 feel
 so


quick,
 really
 responsible,
 but
 I
 do
 so
 I


want
 to
 do
 it
 as
 good
 as
 we
 can
 have
 the


best
 time
 possible.
 Let's
 see
 what


happens
 then.
 But
 on
 a
 private
 basis,
 I


can
 tell
 you
 with
 all
 the
 things


happening
 around,
 stay
 healthy
 and
 enjoy


this
 part
 of
 life
 because
 you
 know
 now


most
 things
 happened
 and
 most
 things


were
 really
 good.
 There
 was
 another
 time


um
 your
 age
 when
 you
 are
 not
 sure
 where


you
 want
 to
 go
 where
 where
 can
 what's


possible
 how
 safe
 you
 will
 be
 um
 and
 all


these
 kind
 of
 things
 where
 will
 you
 live


in
 the
 future
 so
 I
 know
 where
 we
 will


live
 I
 know
 how
 things
 worked
 out
 that's


really
 good
 I'm
 not
 that
 old
 that
 I


cannot
 move
 so
 move


and
 try
 and
 do
 sports
 and
 travel
 and
 all


these
 kind
 of
 things
 so
 I
 I'm
 more
 than


happy
 with
 the
 things
 how
 they


how
 they
 panned
 out,
 how
 they
 happened.


I'm
 really
 really
 happy.
 I'm
 surprised


how
 my
 career
 was.
 I
 I
 never
 thought


that.
 And
 you
 cannot
 plan
 it
 and
 and


stuff
 like
 this.
 I'm
 super
 happy
 with
 my


private
 life,
 how
 it
 is.
 Super
 happy


with
 the
 Mrs.
 Super
 happy
 with
 the
 kids,


super
 happy
 with
 the
 grandkids.
 It's
 all


really
 good.
 So,
 what
 can
 you
 want
 more


really
 without
 sounding
 ridiculous
 that


you
 think,
 "Oh,
 you
 still
 want
 that."


and
 the
 rest
 is
 job.
 And
 the
 job
 I'd


always
 wanted
 to
 do
 as
 somehow
 possible


and
 that's
 still
 the
 case.


>> Is
 he
 a
 Man
 United
 fan?


>> Why?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 If
 you
 ever
 want
 a
 job
 at


a
 football
 club,
 Manchester
 United
 would


uh


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 After
 all
 the
 time
 we


spent
 together.
 Yeah.
 You
 want
 to
 tell


me
 that?


>> Yeah.
 No,
 but
 you
 know
 it's
 um
 it's


really
 it's
 really
 interesting
 to
 me


because
 I
 think
 there's
 always
 an


assumption
 that
 people
 want
 to
 continue


to
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 understand
 that
 do


the
 same
 you
 because
 that's
 what
 you
 are


good
 at.
 I
 know
 I'm
 good
 as
 a
 manager.
 I


know
 so
 why
 should
 I
 I
 don't
 have
 to


prove
 that
 not
 even
 to
 me
 I
 have
 to


prove
 that
 I
 can
 raise
 my
 hand
 and


tomorrow
 I
 can
 coach
 club
 X
 Y
 and
 Zed


clubs
 who
 are
 happy
 now
 with
 sector


manager
 and
 I
 don't
 want
 that.
 So,
 so


but
 to
 be
 my
 best
 friend
 that
 might
 come


back
 that
 I
 say
 okay
 I'm
 ready
 that


might
 I
 don't
 know
 today
 but
 in
 this


moment
 it's
 not
 that
 I
 cannot
 do
 what
 I


do
 while
 thinking
 with
 one
 leg
 being


still
 there
 I
 was
 never
 like
 that
 I


never
 looked
 right
 or
 left
 when
 I
 was
 at


mines
 I
 could
 have
 changed
 the
 club


every
 year
 for
 the
 first
 seven
 it
 was
 so


obvious
 that
 something
 is
 going
 on
 there


pretty
 special
 that
 clubs
 want
 oh
 we


want
 to
 have
 him
 and
 I
 never
 thought
 a


second
 that
 I
 want
 to
 go
 there.
 I
 wanted


to
 stay
 at
 mines
 to
 to
 to
 do
 what
 we
 do


and
 to
 learn
 what
 I
 thought
 I
 have
 to


learn.
 Same
 at
 Dortmund,
 same
 at


Liverpool
 until
 I
 thought
 it's
 not


right.
 If
 that
 comes
 again,
 let's
 see


what
 we
 can
 what
 we
 will
 do.
 That's
 what


the
 decision
 I
 wanted.
 I
 want
 didn't


want
 to
 make
 the
 job
 until
 I
 barely
 can


move.
 I
 barely
 can
 travel.
 I
 barely
 Mrs.


Can
 you
 help
 me?
 I
 don't
 want
 I
 didn't


want
 to
 do
 that.
 Yeah,
 we're
 sitting
 and


yes,
 I'm
 25
 years
 older
 than
 you,
 but
 we


both
 could


probably
 run
 around
 the
 corner
 now
 and


it
 would
 not
 be
 the
 biggest
 difference.


>> You're
 in
 great
 shape.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 because
 I
 train.
 That's
 how


it
 is.
 But
 I
 never
 did
 while
 I
 was
 a


manager.
 That's
 the
 next
 thing.
 I
 just


grew
 more
 and
 more
 and
 more
 and
 now
 uh


we
 have
 time
 for
 that
 as
 well.
 No,
 it's


good
 how
 it
 is.


Well,
 you
 um
 even
 as
 a
 United
 fan,
 you


you
 brought
 so
 much
 to
 the
 Premier


League
 that
 it
 was
 it
 was
 weirdly
 sad


also
 very
 happy
 when
 you
 decided
 that


you
 were
 going
 to
 leave.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I


felt
 two
 feelings
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 I


felt
 very
 very
 happy
 that
 this
 was
 this


Liverpool
 era
 in
 my
 view
 was
 over


because
 I
 thought
 there's
 no
 way


>> you
 leaving.
 You're
 more
 than
 just
 a


manager.
 You're
 the
 spirit
 of
 this
 city.


You're
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 fan
 base.


You're
 actually
 sort
 of
 personify
 the


Liverpool
 fan
 base
 in
 my
 mind.
 extremely


passionate
 allin
 togetherness
 and
 as
 you


know
 your
 former
 I
 think
 he
 was
 your


chairman
 or
 owner
 of
 mine
 said
 you
 did


you
 brought
 you
 brought
 the
 team


together
 you
 then
 brought
 the
 city


together
 and
 that
 had
 a
 profound
 impact


both
 on
 Liverpool
 but
 also
 on
 the


Premier
 League
 and
 on
 my
 enjoyment
 and


my
 misery
 as
 a
 rival
 fan
 and
 that's
 a


really
 really
 remarkable
 thing.
 You've


also
 inspired
 me
 as
 a
 lot
 on
 a
 personal


level
 as
 a
 leader
 just
 about
 you
 know


everything
 you
 said
 there
 about
 how


important
 it
 is
 to
 focus
 equally
 on
 the


people
 and
 the
 team
 and
 the
 togetherness


and
 not
 just
 on
 the
 tactics
 and
 the


strategy
 and
 how
 passion
 can
 be
 and
 a


wonderful
 accelerant
 for
 performance
 and


for
 feeling
 like
 this
 is
 special
 and


that's
 something
 that
 I
 think
 you've


personified
 as
 a
 leader.
 We
 um
 we
 have
 a


closing
 tradition
 on
 this
 podcast
 where


the
 last
 guest
 leaves
 a
 question
 for
 the


next
 guest
 not
 knowing
 who
 they're


leaving
 it
 for.


>> Oh.


>> And
 the
 question


>> Oh,
 it's
 for
 me,
 not
 a
 message.


>> Yes.


>> Oh,


>> question
 that's
 been
 left
 for
 you.


As
 you
 look
 back
 on
 your
 career,


is
 there
 a
 particular
 moment,
 a


particular
 conversation,
 a
 particular


day


that
 if
 you
 could
 you
 would
 go
 back
 and


change
 or
 say
 something
 you
 wish
 you
 had


said?
 I
 honestly
 the
 problem
 is


I
 would
 probably
 would
 say
 no.
 I
 don't
 I


wouldn't
 go
 back
 and
 and
 and
 try
 to


change
 it
 because
 it
 wouldn't
 have
 a
 big


impact.
 the
 situations
 we
 had,


the
 big
 situations
 I
 could
 influence


with
 the
 things
 I
 said,
 the
 specific


moments
 which
 were
 then
 decisive.
 You


just
 stand
 there
 and
 watch


Aguero
 in
 or
 not
 in
 we
 the
 same
 problem


with
 United
 where
 things
 the
 ball
 goes


in
 or
 the
 ball
 is
 over
 the
 line
 for
 11


million
 or
 not.
 That
 has
 nothing
 to
 do


with
 what
 I
 say.
 Would
 I
 wish
 if
 I
 could


go
 there
 and
 give
 it
 a
 little
 push?
 Yes.


Would
 I
 wish
 James
 Madison
 would
 block


the
 shot
 of
 Vincent
 Kane
 that
 he
 cannot


score
 the
 goal
 against
 Leicester?
 Yes.


But
 it
 had
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 what
 I


said.
 And
 so
 the
 things
 I
 said
 I
 said
 in


the
 moment
 for
 the
 right
 reasons.
 Um,


and
 sometimes
 they
 had
 the
 impact
 I


wished


and
 wanted
 and
 sometimes
 not.


>> Yeah,
 I
 had
 to
 accept
 that.


>> That
 was
 the
 other
 thing
 that
 um
 Jamie


Carrager
 asked.
 He
 said,
 "Oh,
 when
 you


see
 when
 you
 see
 ask
 him
 how
 he
 feels


about
 his
 former
 assistant
 manager,
 Pep


Lingers
 going
 and
 working


>> going
 and
 working
 at
 Manchester
 City."


>> Absolutely.
 No
 problem.
 I
 like
 it.
 I
 I


like
 both
 Peps.
 That's
 how
 it
 is.
 No


problem
 uh
 with
 that.
 Um
 I
 worked


together
 with
 Pep
 Blinders.
 He
 was
 an


inspiration
 for
 me
 every
 day
 when
 we


worked
 together.
 Absolutely
 every
 day.
 I


learned
 a
 lot
 from
 him.
 And
 Pep


Guardiola
 I
 couldn't
 respect
 a
 manager


more.
 Um
 and
 when
 they
 asked
 me
 like
 a


bit
 what
 do
 you
 think
 can
 we?
 Of
 course


you
 can.
 Pepinos
 I
 said
 come
 on
 find
 a


guy
 who
 worked
 together
 with
 Pep
 Liners


Pep
 Gardula
 and
 Jurgen
 club.
 I
 would


read
 the
 book.


Uh,
 and
 yeah,
 and
 Pep
 knew
 exactly
 Pep


um
 Gardula
 knew
 exactly
 what
 he
 was


looking
 for.
 Yeah,
 he
 wanted
 to,
 you


know,
 want
 exactly
 this
 kind
 of
 um


spark
 fire
 from
 and
 Pep
 has
 that.
 Pep
 is


Pep
 Lions
 has
 that.
 He
 is
 an
 extreme


well
 of
 of
 energy
 and
 um
 so
 I'm
 happy


for
 them
 both.


>> We're
 playing
 you
 guys.
 Um
 this
 week,


this
 weekend
 on
 Sunday.


>> What?


>> United.


>> Manchester
 United
 Liverpool
 this
 Sunday.


You
 didn't
 know.


>> It's
 at
 Anfield.
 It's
 a
 Premier
 League,


Dar.


>> That's
 crazy
 that
 you
 don't
 know.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> But
 hopefully
 after
 So
 this
 will
 come


out
 just
 after
 that.
 So
 I'm
 hoping


that's
 four
 losses.


>> Oh,
 we
 come
 after
 that.


>> When
 when
 do
 we
 get


>> hopefully
 the
 day
 after,
 but
 we'll
 see.


Um
 so
 hopefully
 this
 is
 your
 fourth


Liverpool's
 fourth
 loss
 in
 a
 row.
 And
 uh


the
 fan
 base
 are
 growing
 increasingly


impatient
 and
 they're
 annoyed
 and
 Amarim


has
 now
 won
 another
 another
 game
 in
 a


row.
 So
 this
 is
 this
 conversation
 will


come
 out
 straight
 after.


>> Wow.


>> Now
 we
 playing
 at
 Anfield.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Good
 luck.


>> They
 have
 to
 strike
 back.
 Yeah.
 You
 know


that's
 never
 a
 good
 situation.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know
 that
 two
 days
 ago.
 So
 I
 just
 in


the
 morning
 I
 wake
 up
 pretty
 early
 in


the
 morning.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 throw
 on
 YouTube


and
 have
 a
 look
 and
 then
 it
 shows
 me


behind
 the
 scenes
 footage
 from
 the
 7.


>> The
 7?
 Oh
 gosh.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 never
 saw
 that.


I
 never
 saw
 it
 but
 it's
 like
 the
 7.


Obviously
 I
 know
 the
 goals
 and
 stuff
 but


it's
 the
 camera
 different.
 It's
 in
 the


stands
 and
 it's
 really
 good.
 So
 okay


fine.
 I
 watch
 it
 19
 minutes
 really
 good.


So
 all
 the
 goals
 again
 and
 you
 see


players
 in
 the
 dressing
 room
 all
 the
 way


to
 the
 dress
 room.
 Really
 good.
 The
 next


day
 I
 I
 open
 and
 because
 I
 you
 know
 how


it
 is
 with
 the
 algorithm
 now
 I
 see
 the


5-nil
 at
 at
 Manchester.
 So
 and
 I
 watch


that
 and
 today
 I
 come
 here
 and
 had
 no


clue
 that
 you
 are
 Manchester
 United
 fan.


So
 I
 I
 was
 really
 well
 prepared
 for
 that


talk
 I
 have
 to
 say


without
 knowing.
 Yeah.


>> Damn.
 Yeah.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 Jagen.


Thank
 you
 for
 taking
 the
 time.
 Thank
 you


for
 being
 an
 inspiration
 to
 me,
 but
 also


thank
 you
 for
 all
 that
 you
 brought
 to


the
 Northwest
 and
 to
 Liverpool.


>> Sure.
 Thanks.
 Welcome.
 It
 was
 my


pleasure.


>> Honestly,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.
 And
 I
 I'


I've
 learned
 so
 much
 from
 you
 as
 a


leader
 and
 also
 as
 a
 man.
 And
 in
 the


leadup
 to
 this,
 I
 spoke
 to
 so
 many


people
 around
 you
 that
 have
 worked
 with


you.
 I
 contacted
 Jordan
 Henderson.
 I


spoke
 to
 um
 Carrager,
 who
 knows
 you


through
 various
 people.
 I
 think
 he


managed
 him
 for
 one
 game,
 he
 said.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 In
 Australia.


>> In
 the
 Australia
 game.
 And
 they
 all
 said


the
 same
 thing.
 They
 all
 said
 that


you're
 the
 same
 man
 on
 and
 off
 the


camera.
 You're
 a
 person
 that
 brings


people
 together.
 you're
 extremely


likable,
 but
 you
 have
 high
 standards
 and


are
 an
 incredibly
 passionate
 person.
 And


that
 the
 the
 narrative
 was
 consistently


here
 is
 the
 same
 man
 on
 and
 off
 camera.


Um,
 which
 is
 a
 credit
 to
 yourself
 and
 no


wonder
 why
 people
 were
 willing
 to
 walk


through
 fire
 with
 you.


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 it's
 it's
 incredible
 what
 you've


accomplished
 and
 I
 hope
 selfishly
 as
 a


football
 fan,
 I
 hope
 we
 we
 see
 you
 back


in
 the
 game
 at
 some
 point.


>> Maybe
 Real
 Madrid
 or
 Manchester
 United,


you
 know,
 whatever.


>> You
 never
 know.
 You
 never
 know.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.
