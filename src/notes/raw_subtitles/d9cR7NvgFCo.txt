[Music]


hi
 everybody
 and
 welcome
 to
 in
 good


company
 today
 we
 are
 incredibly
 honored


to
 have
 a
 guest
 who
 needs
 very
 little


introduction
 Magnus
 Carlson
 the
 highest


rated
 chess
 player
 in
 history
 and
 today


we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 business
 or


actually
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 a
 bit
 about


what
 we
 as
 investors
 can
 learn
 from


chess
 and
 from
 humongus
 very
 welcome


thank
 you
 very
 much
 now
 um
 during
 um
 the


second
 world
 war
 in
 uh
 Britain
 uh
 pretty


much
 every
 chess
 expert
 were
 recruited


to
 the
 ultra
 project
 which
 was
 basically


cracking
 cods
 used
 by
 the
 Nazis
 and
 so


there's
 been
 this
 assumption
 that
 uh


brilliant
 chess
 mines
 are
 brilliant
 at


everything
 and
 I
 was
 just
 wondering
 uh


what
 do
 you
 think
 we
 in
 business
 can


learn
 from
 chess
 it's
 um
 funny
 you


should
 mention
 that
 cuz
 um
 my
 uh


father's
 parents
 uh
 they
 were
 born
 uh


before
 the
 war
 they
 were
 very
 much
 into


everything
 that's
 American
 and
 English


because
 um
 that
 those
 were
 sort
 of
 what


they
 saw
 as
 the
 victors
 of
 the
 war
 but


one
 of
 the
 books
 they
 had
 at
 home
 which


um
 they
 recommended
 to
 me
 at
 an
 early
 AG


it
 was
 called
 uh
 K
 Ultra
 I
 think
 a


translation
 for
 to
 Norwegian
 about
 how


they
 cracked
 the
 Enigma
 code
 but
 I


didn't
 know
 until
 the
 time
 of
 the
 um


imitation
 game
 movie
 that
 actually
 chess


players
 were
 involved
 in
 that
 so
 that


angle
 I
 didn't
 really
 know
 um
 I
 also


know
 that
 at
 some
 point
 I
 don't
 know


exactly
 which
 but
 there
 was
 at
 least
 one


hedge
 fund
 on
 Wall
 Street
 that
 was


actively
 recruiting
 chess
 players
 and
 I


think
 at
 least
 a
 couple
 of
 people
 made
 a


really
 good
 career
 from
 from
 that
 but
 I


think
 playing
 chess
 at
 an
 early
 age


certainly
 teaches
 you
 to
 solve
 complex


problems
 in
 a
 limited
 amount
 of
 time


continuing
 to
 only
 play
 chess
 probably


will
 not
 get
 you
 far
 in
 business
 but
 I


think
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 good
 it's
 a
 good


start
 now
 um
 when
 we
 invest
 we
 use
 um


intuition
 quite
 a
 bit
 right
 or
 we


typically
 call
 it
 pattern
 recognition
 we


we
 find
 it
 useful
 when
 the
 situation
 is


complex
 when
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 experience


and
 when
 we've
 seen
 similar
 situations


before
 so
 pretty
 much
 bang
 in
 line
 with


what
 you
 are
 doing
 in
 in
 Blitz
 how
 do


you
 look
 at
 your
 intuition
 versus


analysis
 just
 how
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about


the
 trade-off
 or
 E
 Trade
 of
 I
 think


chess
 players
 when
 you've
 when
 you
 play


chess
 professionally
 at
 a
 high
 level


your
 brain
 is
 really
 trained
 to
 narrow


the


search
 uh
 and
 to
 use
 intuition
 because


you
 know
 there
 is
 a
 limited
 amount
 of


time
 so
 you're
 trained
 to
 recognize


patterns
 and
 sort
 of
 make
 these
 quick


quick
 decisions
 uh
 and
 I
 think


I
 am
 very
 much
 the
 type
 of
 player
 who


uses
 that
 more
 than
 than
 than
 others
 I


can
 certainly
 calculate
 make
 deeper


decisions
 based
 on
 deeper
 analysis
 but


it
 is
 not
 necessarily
 my
 forte
 usually


when
 I
 lose
 games
 it's
 because
 people


have
 looked
 deeply
 at
 something
 that


I've
 intuitively
 sort
 of
 um
 discarded


and
 I
 guess


that's
 a
 way
 you
 can
 get
 an
 edge
 and
 in


business
 as
 well
 for
 sure
 um
 but
 do
 you


use
 intuition
 to
 figure
 out
 which


directions
 to
 analyze
 more
 or
 um


absolutely
 I
 use
 my
 intuition
 so
 how


many
 do
 you
 end
 up
 with
 so
 you
 use
 your


intuition
 you
 you
 then
 think
 about
 how


many
 different
 Alternatives
 I
 would
 say


as
 a
 rule
 if
 I
 think
 about
 more
 than


three
 Alternatives
 I'm
 clueless
 then


I've
 uh
 then
 I've
 probably
 then
 I'm


probably
 not
 happy
 with
 any
 of
 them
 um


usually
 I
 think
 about
 two
 Alternatives


of
 what
 to
 do
 and
 I
 usually
 have
 a
 bias


uh
 towards
 one
 of
 them
 but
 I
 try
 and
 cut


that
 out
 as
 much
 as
 I
 can
 uh
 and
 try
 and


look
 at
 both
 Alternatives
 objectively


and
 then
 again
 if
 both
 of
 them
 don't


satisfy
 me
 I
 might
 look
 at
 a
 third
 I
 I


heard
 you
 somewhere
 say
 that
 you
 you


felt
 that
 you
 didn't
 add
 much
 value


after
 10
 15
 minutes
 I
 think
 after
 10
 15


minutes
 um
 that's
 when
 you
 first
 of
 all


it's
 hard
 for
 our
 minds
 to
 to
 have
 the


level
 of
 concentration
 that
 you
 need
 for


much
 longer
 than
 that
 but
 I
 think
 you


usually
 start
 looking
 pretty
 widely
 at


diff
 at
 other
 Alternatives
 and
 sometimes


they
 can
 load
 somewhere
 but
 usually
 they


um
 they
 don't
 so
 yeah
 I
 would
 say
 for


for
 a
 fairly
 deep
 think
 about
 15
 minutes


is
 probably
 is
 probably
 a
 good
 time
 well


we
 we
 we
 often
 see
 people
 who


overanalyze


situations
 so
 if
 you
 were
 to
 go
 on
 after


15
 minutes
 what
 would
 happen
 then
 after


15
 minutes
 I'll
 probably
 be
 widening
 the


search
 and
 or
 just
 end
 up
 going
 in


circles
 um
 so
 I
 probably
 would
 not
 add


too
 much
 value
 after
 that
 and
 um
 I
 might


end
 up
 cuz
 my
 thought
 process
 is
 not


that


um
 it's
 a
 bit
 chaotic
 so
 I
 might
 end
 up


um
 playing
 a
 move
 that
 I
 that
 I
 was


considering
 earlier
 and
 then
 I
 forgot


why
 it
 was
 not
 good
 because
 it's
 it
 was


20
 minutes
 ago
 and
 my
 brain
 had
 just


processed
 a
 lot
 of
 information
 that


since
 that
 time
 so
 I
 forgotten
 a


crucial
 um
 crucial
 detail
 a
 lot
 of


things
 can
 go
 wrong
 if
 you
 think
 for
 too


long
 that's
 for
 sure
 well
 what
 we
 see


often
 in
 inves
 thing
 is
 that
 if
 you


spend
 too
 much
 time
 on
 it
 you
 become


more
 certain
 but
 not
 it
 but
 the
 decision


doesn't
 improve
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 very
 G


good
 way
 to
 to
 put
 it
 actually
 um
 and
 U


that's
 that's
 true
 that
 often
 if
 I'm
 not


a
 professionist
 in
 chess
 I
 am
 a


practical
 player
 I
 want


to
 um
 I
 want
 to
 get
 as
 good
 result
 as


possible
 and
 then
 know
 that
 I
 I
 have


limited
 limited
 time
 uh
 but
 you
 see
 a


lot
 of
 perfectionists
 they
 think
 for
 45


minutes
 and
 they
 end
 up
 making
 an


obvious
 move
 that
 they
 certainly


considered
 from
 the
 from
 the
 get-go
 so
 I


think
 there
 is
 certainly
 something
 in


that
 I'm
 just
 a
 slightly
 personal
 that
 I


mean
 you
 you
 are
 the
 number
 one
 uh
 you


know
 player
 in
 the
 world
 and
 you've


already
 uh
 characterize
 your
 thinking
 as


chaotic
 and
 uh
 you're
 not
 the


perfectionist


so
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 tell
 you
 this


so
 I
 am
 I
 I
 want
 to
 learn
 and
 I
 want
 to


get
 as
 good
 at
 chess
 as
 possible
 so
 I


mean
 saying
 I'm
 not
 a
 perfectionist
 is


slightly
 inaccurate
 it
 but
 it
 is
 in
 the


sense
 that
 I


will
 not
 sort
 of
 widen
 my
 search
 in


order
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 I
 don't
 miss


anything
 from
 from
 the
 get-go
 uh
 or
 at


least
 I
 will
 rarely
 do
 that
 because
 I


know
 it's
 not
 an
 effective
 usage
 of
 my


time
 I
 think
 for
 everything
 in
 life
 if


if
 we
 had
 unlimited
 time
 to
 make


decisions
 we
 would
 make
 them
 quite


differently
 but
 there's
 always
 this


element


of
 yeah
 I
 I
 have
 to
 make
 a
 decision
 at


some
 point
 now
 in
 investing
 we
 it's


about
 uh
 long-term
 strategy
 and
 so
 on


how
 how
 long
 term
 how
 long
 term
 can
 you


be
 how
 how
 far
 ahead
 do
 you
 think
 so


when
 you
 start
 out
 how
 many
 moves
 have


you
 thought
 about
 openings
 you
 usually


have
 something
 something
 prepared
 but


after
 that
 you
 have
 a
 general
 idea
 of


what
 plants
 you
 want
 to
 you
 want
 to
 use


what
 pawn
 structures
 are
 good
 what


pieces
 would
 be
 good
 in
 those
 structures


so
 with
 these
 patterns
 you
 can
 you
 can


plan
 quite
 far
 ahead
 in
 in
 terms
 of
 what


what
 do
 you
 want
 to
 achieve
 and
 where


you
 eventually
 think
 you
 might
 um
 win


the
 game
 so
 you
 always
 look
 far
 ahead


but
 then
 you
 also
 have
 an
 opponent
 who


constantly
 tries
 to
 ruin
 your
 plans
 so


you
 have
 all
 the
 time
 you
 have
 both


things
 in
 mind
 shortterm
 and
 long-term


planning
 when
 when
 do
 you
 find
 chess


easy
 and
 when
 do
 you
 find
 it
 hard
 I
 find


chess
 easy


when
 I
 can
 sort


of
 play
 with
 flow
 when
 when
 the
 first


thought
 that
 comes
 into
 my
 head
 is


usually
 the
 right
 one
 then
 that's
 that's


when
 it's
 uh
 that's
 when
 it
 when
 it's


easy
 when
 I'm
 always
 when
 I'm
 not
 when


I'm
 on
 the
 front
 foot
 when
 I'm
 not


reacting
 to
 what
 my
 opponent
 is
 doing


that's
 like
 that's
 really
 U
 really


important
 like
 very
 sure
 sign
 of
 bad


form
 is
 that
 you
 uh


um
 you
 see
 um
 your
 opponent's
 threats


sort
 of
 before
 you
 see
 your
 own
 response


because
 they
 should
 be
 uh
 they
 should


sort
 of
 come
 at
 the
 same
 same
 time
 but


yeah
 CH
 it's
 just
 easy
 when
 I
 can
 play


with
 intuition
 that's
 a
 simple
 simple


answer
 now
 in
 in
 chess
 you
 have
 uh


perfect
 information
 what
 do
 you
 think


would
 have
 happened
 if
 uh
 you
 didn't


have
 perfect
 information
 like
 in
 like
 in


business
 so
 chess
 is
 unique
 in
 the
 sense


that
 it's
 you
 have
 perfect
 information


but
 it's
 still
 very
 difficult
 so
 I
 sort


of
 think
 about
 it
 in
 the
 way
 that
 we


are
 well
 informed
 we
 all
 sort
 of
 have


the
 same
 tools
 but
 it's
 about
 how
 you


use
 those
 those
 tools
 and
 the


information
 um
 that
 you
 have
 so
 yes
 we


do
 have
 perfect
 information
 but
 I
 I
 I


sort
 of
 I
 I
 don't
 see
 it
 that
 way
 cuz
 uh


you
 still
 cannot
 you
 still
 cannot


calculate
 every
 um
 every
 possibility
 but


you
 also
 play
 poker
 a
 bit
 uh
 I
 also
 yeah


I
 I've
 played
 a
 bit
 of
 Poker
 for
 sure


yeah
 um
 where
 there
 is
 an
 element
 of


John
 uh
 uh
 yeah
 that's
 annoying
 part


that's
 the
 annoying
 part
 of
 playing


playing
 poker
 um
 I
 think
 that
 games
 like


poker
 are
 different
 are
 interesting
 in
 a


in
 a
 different
 sense
 but
 what
 I
 feel
 is


that
 the
 best
 players
 now
 they
 play
 in
 a


different
 way
 so
 they
 play
 in
 a
 less
 uh


exploitative
 style
 so
 they
 sort
 of
 treat


the
 game
 as
 if
 everybody
 has
 the
 the


same
 information
 rather
 than
 um


they
 try
 and
 sort
 of
 create
 their
 game


against
 uh
 as
 something
 that
 doesn't


really
 depend
 on
 their
 um
 opponents
 in


the
 in
 the
 in
 the
 end
 like
 they
 the
 game


play
 is
 not
 that
 different
 I
 would
 say


moving
 on
 to
 risk
 so
 um
 when
 do
 you


decide
 to
 play
 conservatively
 and
 when


do
 you
 play
 more
 risky
 my
 level
 of


aggressiveness
 risk
 taking
 in
 a
 game
 uh


depends
 a
 lot
 on
 the
 tournament


situation
 but
 also
 on
 my
 opponents


against
 more
 passive
 opponents
 people


who
 play
 solidly
 who
 are
 risk
 averse
 I


will
 naturally
 take
 more
 risks
 and
 vice


vice
 versa
 um
 if
 I
 know
 I'm
 playing
 a


very
 aggressive
 opponent
 I
 might
 take
 a


more
 cautious
 approach
 why
 um
 because
 I


think
 that
 I
 don't
 need
 to
 create


imbalance
 in
 the
 game
 my
 opponent
 will


create
 that
 balance
 imbalance
 and
 I


generally
 believe
 that
 imbalance
 in
 the


game
 in
 the
 long
 run
 is
 it's
 good
 for
 me


of
 course
 in
 the
 short
 term
 it
 can
 be
 it


can
 be
 dangerous
 but
 um
 in
 the
 long
 run


it's
 it's
 going
 to
 yield
 me
 uh
 the
 best


results
 because
 they
 they
 will
 fail
 uh


because
 um
 because
 if
 the
 games
 are
 more


imbalance
 they
 will
 there
 will
 be
 more


decisive
 games
 fewer
 draws
 and
 since
 I


was
 generally
 make
 better
 decisions
 in


those
 situations
 I
 will
 I
 will
 come
 up


out
 on
 top
 um
 if
 you
 see
 another


scenaria
 where
 people
 play
 really
 really


solidly
 then
 I
 probably
 will
 have
 to


take
 more
 risks
 in
 order
 to
 get
 chances


to
 win
 and
 then
 I
 might
 sometimes


overstretch
 so
 I
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 people


who
 are
 really
 solid
 but
 also
 are
 good


at
 counterattacking
 taking
 their
 chances


like
 you
 not
 you
 cannot
 be
 solid
 without


the
 threat
 of
 Counterattack
 and
 it's


it's
 a
 surprising
 amount
 of
 people
 who


are
 solid
 but
 with
 little
 counter


attacking
 threat
 but
 the
 counter


attackers
 those
 I
 feel
 are
 are
 the
 most


dangerous
 for
 sure
 how
 can
 you
 calibrate


this
 before
 the
 game
 how
 you
 how
 can
 you


calibrate
 opponent's
 risk
 tolerance
 it


comes
 down
 a
 lot
 to
 opening
 choices


um
 whether
 you
 want
 to
 steer
 the
 game


into
 more
 quiet
 Waters
 sometimes
 how


long
 you
 want
 there
 to
 be
 an
 element
 of


computer
 preparation
 maybe
 if


you
 if
 you're
 playing
 a
 risk
 averse


opponent
 you
 will
 take
 them
 out
 of
 book


so
 to
 say
 from
 the
 from
 the
 from
 the


opening
 stage
 to
 force
 them
 to
 make


difficult
 High
 uh
 High
 leverage


decisions
 as
 early
 as
 possible
 has
 has


your
 attitude
 to
 towards
 risk
 um
 changed


a
 lot
 with
 age
 I
 think


uh
 my
 attitude
 hasn't


changed
 changed
 that
 much
 I
 probably


gotten
 better
 in
 general
 at
 assessing


sort
 of
 what
 is
 what
 is
 the
 appropriate


amount
 of
 risk
 to
 take
 at
 times
 but
 then


you
 also
 counterbalance
 that
 with
 sort


of


youthful
 um
 youthful
 Spirit
 which
 makes


it
 Tak
 take
 a
 bit
 more
 risk
 and
 I
 I


think
 it
 sort
 of
 ended
 up
 more
 or
 less


in
 the
 same
 way
 I'm
 certainly
 more


conscious
 of
 these
 of
 these
 things
 now


um
 I
 try
 and
 balance
 them
 more
 but
 I


think
 I
 end
 up
 in
 more
 or
 less
 the
 same


spot
 moving
 on
 to
 to
 teams
 so
 um
 you
 you


have
 a
 you
 have
 a
 team
 who
 helps
 you


prepare
 right
 um
 what
 uh
 how
 does
 a


teamw
 work
 uh
 so
 right
 now
 I
 don't
 have


a
 big
 team
 I've
 had


different
 people
 working
 for
 me
 in
 the


past
 but
 now
 I
 have
 my
 main
 coach
 Peter


um
 who
 has
 been
 helping
 me
 I've
 known


him
 for
 20
 years
 and
 he's
 been
 my
 main


coach
 now
 for
 11
 for
 him
 it's
 mainly


about
 computer
 preparation
 finding
 new


ideas
 which
 is
 becoming
 more
 and
 more


difficult
 um
 and
 basically
 providing
 me


with
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 choice
 so
 I
 can
 I
 can


decide
 what
 to
 do
 against
 um
 certain


opponents
 and
 and
 that
 I
 I
 could
 sort
 of


take
 it
 in
 in
 um
 in
 different
 directions


so
 what
 happens
 so
 so
 let
 so
 a
 work
 day


when
 do
 you
 when
 do
 you
 go
 to
 work
 I


honestly
 I
 don't
 do
 very
 much
 these
 days


in
 terms
 of
 um


preparation
 I
 mainly
 play
 and
 prepare


prepare
 for
 the
 games
 I
 look
 at
 chess


all
 the
 time
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 I'm


always
 studying
 the
 uh
 the
 newest
 games


and
 and
 playing
 for
 practice
 but
 I
 don't


sit
 down
 in
 the
 morning
 and
 think
 I'm


going
 to
 do
 this
 this
 and
 this
 that's


sort
 of
 what
 my
 my
 coach
 does
 that
 he


works
 on
 something
 new
 every
 day
 um
 does


he
 find
 that
 out
 himself
 or
 you
 steer


him
 uh
 sometimes
 I
 steer
 him
 sometimes


he
 will
 start
 out
 working
 on


something
 uh
 and
 then
 I
 will
 you
 know
 I


will
 look
 at
 it
 see
 whether
 I
 like
 it
 or


not
 but
 generally
 he's
 a
 lot
 better
 at


this
 than
 I


am
 uh
 and
 he
 also
 like
 he
 knows
 my


preferences
 in
 general
 uh
 so
 he


generally
 has
 an
 idea
 of
 of
 how
 to
 to
 do


this
 but
 honestly
 I
 F
 I
 find
 the


analysis
 opening
 analysis
 bit
 I
 don't


find
 it
 that
 interesting
 it's
 more
 of
 a


necessary
 thing


to
 be
 able
 to
 to
 get
 uh
 new
 positions


and
 to
 get
 situations
 where
 you
 can
 sort


of
 prove
 your
 playing
 strength
 but
 I


don't
 find
 it
 particularly
 interesting


in
 itself
 so
 I'm
 really
 happy
 to
 to
 sort


of
 delegate
 that
 in
 general
 but
 when
 you


say
 he's
 better
 at
 it
 than
 you
 are


better
 at
 what
 uh
 he's
 better
 at


using
 at
 using
 computer
 engines
 to
 find


new
 ideas
 basically
 using
 different


engines


um
 and
 comparing
 them


um
 trying


to
 trying
 to
 go
 sort
 of
 a
 bit
 deeper
 in


directions
 that
 the
 computer
 doesn't


necessarily
 show
 at
 first
 trying
 to
 find


ways
 that
 I
 can
 play
 where
 I
 sort
 of


increase
 my
 opponent's
 risk
 more
 than


than
 mine
 like
 where
 I
 can
 take
 risks


but
 not
 not
 unacceptable
 risks
 but
 it
 is


is
 is
 really


getting
 it's
 really
 getting
 much
 more


difficult
 if
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 this


15
 years


ago
 his
 he
 was
 doing
 the
 same
 job
 15


years
 ago
 but
 for
 Anan
 who
 was
 a
 world


championship
 back
 then
 and
 I
 think
 he'll


tell
 you
 that
 his
 job
 was
 a
 whole
 lot


easier
 then
 um
 it's
 getting
 very
 very


very
 difficult
 what's
 what's
 getting


more
 difficult
 to
 find
 New


Alternatives
 yeah
 uh
 basically
 you
 have


you
 can
 look
 at
 it
 in
 a
 in
 in
 the
 way


that
 you
 have
 a
 market
 that's
 much


better
 informed
 now
 and
 the
 people
 are


using
 more
 or
 less
 the
 same
 tools
 um
 so


it's
 much
 much
 harder
 to
 find
 to
 find
 an


edge
 did
 you
 train
 differently
 and


prepare
 differently
 let's
 say
 10
 15


years
 ago
 from
 about
 14
 to
 11
 years
 ago


uh
 I
 didn't
 really
 have
 a


coach
 uh
 I
 was
 generally
 I
 had
 some
 I


had
 training
 camps
 with
 people
 but
 I
 was


mostly
 doing
 this
 stuff
 on
 on
 my
 own
 but


it
 was
 not
 nearly
 as
 deep
 as
 what
 is


being
 done
 now
 and
 I
 think
 also
 back


then
 it
 was
 easier
 to
 get
 by
 with


playing
 worse
 openings
 um
 basically
 now


everybody
 sort
 of
 knows
 everything
 there


have
 been
 new
 ways
 that
 have
 been


discovered
 that
 makes
 it
 so
 much
 more


difficult


um
 to
 to
 get
 a
 game
 so
 uh
 I
 think
 I


could
 get
 by
 then
 I
 could
 not
 get
 by
 now


without
 um
 without
 proper
 analysis
 was


it
 more
 fun
 in
 the
 past
 the
 game


yeah


um
 so
 I
 think
 for
 improving
 chess


players
 having
 access
 to
 all
 this


information
 at
 an
 early
 age
 at
 an
 early


stage
 is
 great
 it's
 great
 to
 get
 you
 at


a
 higher
 level
 earlier
 they
 used
 to
 say


that
 back
 in
 the
 day
 like
 in
 order
 to


learn
 a
 new
 opening
 that
 takes
 a


month
 now
 even
 top


players
 can
 just
 turn
 on
 their
 computer


engine
 um
 by
 an
 opening
 course
 and


within
 five
 hours
 like
 you
 can
 know
 like


if
 of
 course
 if
 you
 like
 if
 you
 have
 the


understanding
 and
 so
 on
 like
 you
 can
 you


can
 pretty


much
 know
 these
 things
 pretty
 well
 so
 um


yeah
 it's
 just
 a
 it's
 just
 a
 different


diff
 it's
 just
 a
 different
 age
 I
 think


computer
 engines
 have
 been
 great
 for


spectating
 chess
 but
 for
 the
 players


yeah
 it's
 made
 it
 more
 difficult
 does


that
 mean
 that
 there
 are
 different
 types


of
 personalities
 which
 will
 do
 well
 in


chess
 going
 forward
 what
 do
 you
 think
 so


for
 now
 I
 consider
 myself
 kind
 of
 a


hybrid
 generation
 since
 I
 did
 grow
 up


with
 computers
 but
 I
 would
 I
 was
 not


reliant
 on
 them
 I
 was
 still
 using
 a
 lot


of
 time
 with
 the
 chess
 board
 and
 chess


books
 as
 well
 I
 think
 we're
 seeing
 the


first
 generation
 now
 of
 like
 pure


computer


kids
 uh
 and
 they
 play
 chess
 in
 in
 a
 less


pragmatic
 uh
 sorry
 less
 dogmatic
 um
 more


sort
 of
 computer
 based
 way
 in
 that
 they


are
 less
 intuition
 based
 and
 so
 much


more
 um
 sort
 of
 Brute
 Force


calculation
 um
 so
 it's
 going
 to
 be


interesting
 to
 see
 if
 this
 sort
 of
 new


type
 of
 chess
 player
 beats
 the
 the
 older


ones
 um
 that
 are
 more
 like
 me
 that
 are


more
 based


on
 on
 uh
 on
 F
 do
 you
 you
 think
 would


have
 implications
 for
 which
 countries


dominate
 the
 game
 I
 think
 we're
 already


seeing
 uh
 a
 generation
 now
 of
 Indian


players
 obviously
 there
 are
 huge


individual
 differences
 but
 what
 most
 of


them
 have
 in
 common
 is
 that
 their


calculation
 is
 extremely
 good
 even
 those


players
 who
 have
 zero
 understanding
 of


the


game
 and
 they're
 inter
 in
 or
 Z
 in
 zero


understanding
 I'm
 generally
 mean
 that


their
 intuition
 is
 not
 that
 good
 they


calculates
 so
 well
 that
 with
 longer
 time


controls
 they
 can
 still
 get
 by
 and
 give


even
 people
 like
 me
 a
 really
 really


hard
 time
 what
 about
 China
 Chinese


players
 are
 are
 a
 bit
 different
 it's


it's
 hard
 to
 say
 I
 feel
 like
 there's
 a


bigger
 variety
 within
 uh
 Chinese
 players


you
 have
 some
 players
 who
 are


a
 bit
 of
 the
 same
 as
 the
 uh
 as
 the


Indians
 but
 you
 also
 have
 others
 who


have
 completely
 different
 styles
 you


have
 the
 um
 world
 champion
 right
 now


ding
 who's
 well
 he's
 not
 doing
 great
 at


the
 moment
 but
 at
 his
 Peak
 he
 was
 like


an


incredible
 um
 intuitive


Dynamic
 player
 uh
 so
 um
 yeah
 defin


definitely
 um
 very
 different
 styles


there
 any
 talent
 in
 this
 country
 there


are


definitely
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 are
 very


en
 enthusiastic
 and
 about
 Chess
 and
 are


talented
 as
 well
 in
 terms
 of
 whether


anybody's
 going
 to


become
 uh
 the
 new
 miners
 sort
 of
 or


world
 champion
 one
 day
 that's
 probably


going
 to
 be
 hard
 especially
 since
 we


don't
 have
 the
 numbers
 that
 countries


like
 India
 have
 um
 but
 I
 don't
 find
 that


as
 important
 I


want
 people
 to
 um
 enjoy
 chess
 learn
 it


at
 an
 early
 age
 so
 that
 you
 can
 have
 joy


of
 it
 your
 life
 and
 if
 it
 can
 teach
 you


other
 skills
 as
 well
 then
 that's
 even


better
 moving
 on
 to
 um
 to
 learning
 so


after
 um
 becoming
 World
 Champion
 in
 2013


you
 said
 uh
 I'm
 still
 far
 away
 from


really
 knowing
 chess
 really
 there
 is


still
 much
 I
 can
 learn
 and
 there
 is
 much


I
 still
 don't
 understand
 how
 do
 you
 feel


about
 that
 now
 well
 I
 wish
 I
 could
 say


something
 no
 actually
 I
 don't
 wish


because
 that
 that
 would
 be
 woring
 um
 I


would
 look
 at
 the
 way
 that
 I
 played
 10


years


ago
 and
 think
 that
 I
 was
 coolest
 about
 a


lot
 of
 things
 I
 I
 think
 I
 play
 better


now
 but
 then
 also
 other
 people
 play


better
 so
 my
 results
 are
 not
 necessarily


better
 um
 but
 I
 feel
 like
 I'm
 still


learning


all
 the
 time
 um
 I
 don't
 think
 I'm
 at
 a


point
 in
 in
 my
 career
 where
 where
 I
 will


drastically
 change
 the
 way
 that
 I
 play


but
 I
 do
 feel
 that
 my
 understanding
 of


certain
 ideas
 certain
 positions
 is


always
 evolving
 what
 was
 the
 setback
 you


learned
 the
 most
 from
 when
 it
 comes
 to


chess
 I've
 always
 been


very
 optimistic
 almost
 blindly
 so
 so


I've
 had
 I
 think
 two
 like
 two
 and
 have


specific
 periods
 of
 my
 chess
 career


where
 I've
 stagnated
 or
 even
 gone
 a
 bit


back
 um
 they
 were
 all
 before
 the
 the
 age


of
 19
 and
 during
 those
 times
 I
 always


kept
 a
 very
 positive


mindset
 I
 always
 had
 pretty
 much


delusional
 idea
 ideas
 of
 what
 was
 going


on
 I
 always
 thought
 that
 this
 is
 going


to
 turn
 around
 next
 game
 next
 tournament


I
 probably
 gained
 a
 rating
 that
 was
 a


bit
 higher
 than
 my
 actual
 level
 so
 I
 was


like
 trying
 to
 push
 really


hard
 um
 to
 play
 towards
 that
 level
 um


and
 maybe
 I
 was
 taking
 I
 was
 taking
 too


many
 risks
 I
 was
 forcing
 a
 bit
 but
 I


always
 thought
 like
 next
 time
 next
 game


next
 tournament
 and
 then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


it
 turned
 around
 and
 that's
 what
 H


happened
 every
 single
 every
 single
 time


that
 I
 just
 needed
 like
 one
 good
 moment


and
 then
 I
 believed
 that
 everything
 was


going
 to
 be
 going
 to
 be
 great
 again
 and


ever
 since
 then
 I've
 certainly
 had
 bad


tournaments
 I've
 had
 like
 two
 three


months
 periods
 where
 I
 don't
 play
 but


I've
 sort
 of
 kept
 the
 same
 mindset
 most


of
 the
 time
 that
 overall
 I


think
 I'm
 really
 good
 at
 this
 and
 it's


going
 to
 turn
 around
 um
 so
 I
 haven't


really
 had
 that
 one
 moment
 in
 a
 big


tournament
 in
 a
 in
 a
 championship
 where


I'm
 thinking
 like
 this
 is
 going
 to
 take


some
 time
 to
 recover
 from
 it's
 always


gone
 like
 remarkably
 remarkably
 well


well
 this
 interesting
 this
 positivism


you
 know
 positive
 people
 also
 make
 more


money
 I
 always
 think
 I've
 always
 thought


in
 chess
 that
 the
 right
 balance
 is


somewhere
 between
 optimistic
 and


delusional
 that's
 where
 you're
 going


what
 do
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 delusional


here
 uh
 you
 have
 people
 in
 chess
 who
 are


like
 absolutely
 delusional
 optimists


like
 uh
 former
 World
 Championship


kramnick
 um
 whenever
 I
 um
 whenever
 I


played
 a
 game
 uh
 he
 would
 say
 afterwards


yeah
 it's
 a
 miracle
 you
 survived


and
 H
 he
 would
 say
 again
 against
 me
 and


and
 everybody
 else
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 like


I
 don't
 know
 if
 he
 completely
 believed


it
 but
 then
 like
 he
 would
 he's
 super


fast
 so
 he
 would
 rattle
 off
 variation


after
 variation
 how
 he
 could
 potentially


have
 won
 if
 he
 didn't
 win
 it
 was
 just
 it


was
 usually
 Miracle
 so
 I'm
 probably
 more


on
 the
 side
 that
 I'm
 on
 the
 optimistic


side
 but
 I
 keep
 my
 my
 feet
 on
 the
 ground


at
 least
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 more
 but
 it's


an
 interesting
 kind
 of
 survival


mechanism
 no
 yeah
 I
 I
 do
 think
 I
 do


think
 so
 and
 if
 you
 always
 have
 a


slightly
 more
 optimistic
 Outlook
 you


will
 take
 more
 opportunities
 you
 you


will
 see
 more


opportunities
 um
 you
 will
 take
 more


risks
 you
 will
 put
 more
 pressure
 on
 your


opponents
 so
 I
 think
 it's


um
 uh
 yeah
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 good
 thing
 also


makes
 you
 a
 happier
 person
 supposedly
 at


least
 if
 it
 gives
 good
 results


right
 but
 I
 mean
 it
 makes
 it
 sort
 of


easier
 to


um
 uh
 to
 to
 to
 play
 the
 game
 um
 often


when
 I
 play
 the
 best


I'll
 make
 a
 move
 based
 on
 intuition
 and


then
 I'll
 I'll
 spot
 a
 reason
 right
 after


like
 oh
 I
 missed
 that
 one
 maybe
 that
 was


a
 mistake
 and
 I'll
 think
 no
 actually
 it


wasn't
 wasn't
 a
 mistake
 I
 missed


something
 but
 still
 sort
 of
 my


optimistic
 mindset
 made
 me
 make
 the


right
 decision
 quickly
 based
 on


intuition
 and
 if
 you're
 a
 pessimistic


person
 if
 you
 overthink
 you
 will
 not
 do


that
 does
 any
 this
 uh
 explain
 the
 kind


of
 happy
 streaks
 oh
 yeah
 for
 sure
 um
 uh


I
 I
 can
 recall
 like
 streaks
 where
 I
 just


go
 on
 winning
 winning
 and
 I
 think
 I'm


like
 playing
 Amazing
 then
 I
 look
 back


and


analyze
 and
 it
 wasn't
 that
 great
 so
 what


explains
 the
 the
 results
 then
 because
 I


put
 a
 lot
 of
 pressure
 on
 my
 opponents


and
 my
 optimism
 and
 my
 confidence
 makes


them
 less
 confidence
 how
 important
 is


psychology
 these
 type
 of
 psychology
 in


in
 chess
 I
 think
 psychology
 is
 very


important
 you
 have
 these
 all
 these


people
 who
 have
 the
 same
 tools
 like
 you


have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 understand
 the


game
 at
 a
 level
 that
 is
 at
 least
 similar


to
 what
 I


do
 um
 but
 as
 long
 as
 they
 don't
 have
 the


right
 mindset
 they
 will


inevitably
 um
 not
 take
 enough
 risks
 they


will
 leave
 chances
 at
 the
 table
 maybe


others
 they
 are
 too
 optimistic
 they
 will


take
 too
 many
 risks
 so
 like
 having
 a


balanced
 mindset
 like
 knowing
 where
 to


when
 to
 go
 for
 it
 when
 to
 to
 not
 like


you're
 obviously
 obviously
 never
 going


to
 always
 make
 the
 right
 decisions
 but


um
 yeah
 if
 you're
 conscious
 of
 these


things


like
 inevitably
 you're
 going
 to
 um
 to


make
 better
 decisions
 than
 than
 your


opponents
 do
 you
 think
 um
 successful


chess
 players
 deal
 with
 failures


differently
 than
 less
 successful
 players


is
 how
 much
 of
 the
 winning
 recipe
 is
 in


how
 you
 deal
 with
 failures
 I
 generally


try
 to
 sort
 of
 avoid
 failures
 rather


than
 rather
 than
 um
 sort
 of
 learn
 how
 to


deal
 with
 it
 but
 what
 I
 do
 know
 is
 that


my
 best
 results
 over
 the
 last
 15
 years


so
 my
 rating
 classical
 rating
 has


oscillated
 between
 uh
 20
 2880
 and
 2820


for
 many
 years
 now
 but
 my
 performance


right
 after
 a


loss
 is
 over


2900
 so
 apparently
 I
 do
 do
 something


really
 well
 um
 I
 think
 I
 am
 probably


likely
 to
 take
 a
 bit
 more
 risk
 after


losing
 I
 think
 that's
 one
 thing
 that
 I


will
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 pressure
 on
 my


opponents
 in
 in
 such
 a
 situation
 but
 I


think
 more
 interesting
 situation
 is
 not


in
 classical
 chess
 but
 it's
 in
 Rapid
 and


Blitz
 tournaments
 where
 you
 have
 a


failure
 you
 fail
 to
 win
 a
 winning


position
 or
 you


lose
 um
 a
 painful
 game
 and
 then
 that's


when
 a
 difficult
 part
 comes
 when
 you


have
 to
 play
 a
 lot
 more
 games
 that
 very


same
 very
 s
 same
 day
 and
 that's
 when
 you


can
 see
 even
 myself
 just
 you
 try
 to
 do


the
 right
 things
 but
 your
 mind
 just


cannot
 be
 balance
 so
 you
 end
 up
 sort
 of


you
 end
 up
 sort
 of
 spiraling
 um
 and


that's
 what
 I
 find
 really
 really


difficult
 it's
 interesting
 that
 you
 take


more
 risks
 after
 losing
 right
 because
 in


most
 situations
 in
 life
 people
 take
 less


risk
 after
 losing
 it
 will
 depend
 on
 the


situation
 but
 I
 think
 on
 average
 yes
 I


will
 take
 I
 will
 take
 more
 risks


investors
 generally
 take
 less
 risk
 after


losing
 yeah
 um
 in
 my
 most
 recent


tournament
 um
 I
 did
 lose
 a
 game
 early
 on


um
 and


and
 that
 was
 I
 I
 made
 two
 draws
 and
 then


I
 lost
 one
 so
 I
 was
 sort
 of
 minus
 one


not
 a
 good
 score
 and
 then
 I
 was
 playing


the
 number
 two
 player
 in
 the
 world
 and


then
 I
 actually
 decided
 that
 I
 wasn't


going
 to
 take
 any
 risks
 like
 I
 wanted
 to


stop
 the
 bleeding
 which
 is
 not
 typical


of
 me
 and
 this
 time
 it
 actually
 worked


out
 great
 I
 sort
 of
 managed
 to
 steer
 the


game
 into
 fairly
 Quiet
 Waters
 and
 then
 I


sort


of
 then
 I
 sort
 of
 started
 not
 taking


risks
 but
 at
 least
 I
 didn't
 take
 like
 I


had
 so
 many
 opportunities
 to
 steer
 the


game
 towards
 the
 draw
 and
 and
 I
 and
 and


I
 didn't
 but
 I
 think
 just
 in
 general


like
 having
 that
 little
 fire
 in
 me
 that


I
 normally
 have
 where
 I
 really
 really


want
 to
 strike
 back
 in
 in
 classical


chess
 like
 it's
 it's
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 I


think
 it's
 just
 given
 me
 a
 fairly
 fairly


good
 good
 balance
 also
 like
 I'm


extremely
 focused


after
 a
 loss
 because
 I
 don't
 want
 to


don't
 want
 to
 lose
 another
 one
 so
 I


probably
 like
 spend
 more
 energy
 on
 those


games
 as
 well
 do
 you
 have
 the
 same
 type


of
 fire
 as
 you
 had
 when
 you
 were
 younger


rarely


but
 but
 sometimes
 um
 I
 had
 a
 tournament


recently


where
 uh
 I
 was
 um
 I
 had
 a
 good
 start
 but


there
 was
 um
 a
 guy
 Wei
 Chinese
 guy
 uh


who's
 ranked
 number
 10
 in
 world
 now
 he


had
 a
 Tournament
 of
 his
 life
 This
 was
 um


a
 rapid
 and
 Blitz
 event
 and
 at
 some


point
 I
 realized
 that
 like
 a
 good
 event


is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 nearly
 enough
 for
 me


like
 I
 have
 to
 win
 every
 single
 game
 now


and
 that
 was
 my
 mindset
 I
 I
 I
 like
 I
 was


winning
 these
 games
 like
 purely
 on
 on


will
 uh
 taking
 like
 risks
 here
 and
 there


and
 I
 ended
 up
 winning
 10
 games
 in
 a
 row


and
 I
 Won
 Won
 won
 the
 tournament
 um
 but


it's


I
 don't
 know
 you
 cannot
 always
 you


cannot
 always
 do
 that
 uh
 that
 was
 easier


for
 me
 earlier
 like
 now
 I
 really
 I
 had


to
 fire
 myself
 up
 for
 how
 do
 you
 get


into
 that
 mental
 stage
 I
 think
 at
 that


point
 you
 sort
 of
 have
 to
 treat
 every


game
 as
 Do
 or
 Die
 really
 uh
 you're
 sort


of
 told


that
 you
 know
 you
 shouldn't
 do
 anything


special
 like
 but
 I
 think
 in
 those


situations
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 different
 mind


like
 these
 things
 obviously
 could
 go


horribly
 wrong
 but
 if
 you
 want
 to
 try


and
 get
 on
 the
 streak
 where
 you


just
 win
 every
 single
 game
 then
 yeah
 I


think
 you
 just
 have
 to
 to
 take
 risks


every
 single
 game
 and
 be
 like
 like


Survival
 Mod
 like
 100%
 for
 but
 do
 you
 do


self
 talk
 do
 you
 go
 into
 the
 bathroom


look
 yourself
 in
 the
 mirror
 and
 said


Magnus
 get
 your
 finger
 out
 sharpen
 up


here
 I
 don't
 feel
 like
 I
 don't
 really


need
 to
 do
 that
 because
 when
 I
 sit
 down


at
 the
 board
 that's
 what
 I
 need
 to
 what


what
 I
 need
 to
 do
 but
 I
 I
 do
 know
 know


that
 I
 I
 need
 to
 like
 put
 every
 inch
 of


pressure
 on
 my
 my
 opponent
 and
 and
 yeah


maybe
 go
 more
 from
 optimistic
 to


solutional
 probably
 how
 do
 you
 cleanse


your
 mind
 after
 a
 a
 a
 loss
 after
 a
 bad


game
 when
 I
 lose
 it
 kind
 of
 depends
 on


how
 I
 lose
 if
 I
 feel
 that
 I
 did
 a
 lot
 of


things
 well
 but
 at
 a
 certain
 moment
 I


didn't
 calculate
 deeply
 enough
 if
 I
 did


something
 that
 I
 if
 I
 made
 a
 mistake


that
 I
 I
 know
 that
 I
 can


make
 and
 it's
 not
 a
 mistake
 necessarily


of


negligence
 then
 I'm
 sort
 of
 it
 annoys
 me


but
 I'm
 sort
 of
 fine
 with
 that
 and
 and


then
 my
 mindset
 is
 basically
 we
 move
 on


if
 I
 know
 that
 I've
 made
 avoidable


mistakes
 if
 my
 mindset
 was
 wrong
 all
 of


these
 things


yeah
 then
 I
 I
 have
 to
 try
 and


reset
 um
 completely
 like
 just
 take
 a


minute
 to
 myself
 like
 focus
 on
 breathing


try
 and
 be
 somewhere
 else
 for
 for
 a


moment


and
 uh
 and
 see
 if
 I
 can
 get
 it
 back
 but


it's
 yeah
 it's
 it's
 at
 that
 moment
 is
 is


not
 easy
 um
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 day
 uh


to
 recover
 then
 is
 usually
 hard
 to
 get


back
 if
 you
 make
 a
 bad
 move
 in
 your
 in


your
 personal
 life
 do
 you
 manage
 to
 put


it
 behind
 you
 quickly
 as


well
 well
 do
 you
 make
 bad
 Moves
 In
 C


life
 I
 think


um
 I
 think
 um
 at
 times
 like
 I
 will
 make


decisions
 sometimes
 like
 out
 of
 NE


negligence
 I
 will
 not
 do
 the
 right
 thing


and
 that's
 that
 can
 be
 a
 bit
 it
 can
 be


annoying
 it
 can
 be
 embarrassing
 I
 think


I
 experienc
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 same
 emotions


that
 that
 everybody
 body
 does
 as
 other


people
 like
 I
 find
 it
 also
 really
 hard


to
 change
 to
 change
 patterns
 completely


in
 the
 fund
 we
 have
 this
 uh
 investment


simulator
 where
 we
 analyze
 mistakes


investment
 mistakes
 and
 you
 of
 course


have
 your
 famous
 chess
 engine
 what
 do


you
 what
 do
 you
 get
 out
 of
 that
 I
 do


find
 it
 interesting
 to
 look
 at
 my
 games


with
 engines
 after
 and
 I
 like
 I
 always


do
 that
 um
 but
 it's
 very
 important
 to
 be


able
 ident
 to
 identify
 what
 are
 sort
 of


human
 mistakes
 and
 and
 what
 are
 um
 what


are
 um
 what
 are
 the
 mistakes
 that
 only


like
 computers
 can
 identify


because
 you
 cannot
 condition
 yourself
 to


try
 and
 play
 like
 an
 engine
 or
 at
 least


with
 my
 style
 I
 cannot
 um


so
 at
 certain
 times
 like
 looking
 at


games
 with
 engines
 like
 you
 have
 to
 be


you
 have
 to
 try
 and
 understand
 what
 you


did
 wrong
 even
 if
 the
 reason
 is


non-intuitive


um
 in
 order
 to
 learn
 but
 you
 cannot
 base


you
 cannot
 base
 everything
 on
 that


because
 your


opponents
 they
 will
 continue
 to
 be
 human


and
 make
 human
 um
 errors
 and
 also
 yeah


make
 good
 and
 bad
 moves
 as
 as
 humans
 not


as
 engin
 I've
 heard
 you
 talk
 about
 um


physical
 health
 and
 how
 that
 uh
 impacts


your
 games
 and
 and
 in
 a
 way
 your
 mental


health
 just
 how
 how
 do
 you
 feel
 that


they're
 Interlink
 I
 mean
 you're
 you're
 a


fit
 guy
 right
 I
 think
 for
 anything
 if


your
 body
 is
 fit
 your
 mind
 is
 fit
 you're


going
 to
 perform
 better
 I've
 probably


been
 lazier
 in
 the
 last
 few
 years
 when


it
 comes
 to
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 Fitness


than
 than
 I
 was
 before
 um
 wait
 how
 many


how
 many
 times
 a
 week
 do
 you
 work
 out


I've
 never
 had
 a
 schedule
 much
 so
 now


nowadays
 I
 golf
 a
 lot
 so
 I
 do


get
 um
 like
 my
 steps
 every
 single
 day
 I


play
 a
 bit
 of
 paddle
 I
 do
 when
 I'm
 at


home
 I
 probably
 do
 like
 once
 a


week
 uh
 strength
 workout
 but
 I
 don't


particularly
 like
 that
 um
 so
 I
 was


definitely
 like
 fitter
 before
 when
 I


was
 my
 in
 my
 early
 20s
 I
 would
 win
 a
 lot


of
 games
 purely
 on
 stamina
 because
 I
 was


like


physically
 stronger
 but
 yeah
 nowadays
 I


find
 it
 find
 it
 difficult
 to
 to
 sort
 of


be
 in
 that
 shape
 how
 was
 your
 golf
 I


started
 Golf
 last
 year
 uh
 and
 I
 really


enjoy
 it
 um
 but
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 very


good
 but
 it
 it's
 um
 it's
 a
 way
 for
 me
 to


at
 least
 you
 know
 uh
 get
 some
 exercise


every
 single
 day
 when
 we
 go
 back
 and


look
 at
 your


uh
 your
 history
 and
 I
 think
 yourself
 you


say
 that
 you
 were
 at
 really
 at
 the
 top


of
 your
 game
 in
 13
 and
 19
 what
 what


stand
 out
 with
 those
 years
 I
 think
 13
 14


um
 I
 was
 really
 fit
 I
 just
 started


working
 with
 a
 new
 coach
 that
 helped
 a


bit
 that
 I
 had
 some
 some
 ideas
 but
 it


was
 not
 only
 that
 I
 think
 it
 was
 just
 at


that
 time
 was
 sort
 of
 at
 my
 Peak
 like


close
 to
 my
 Peak
 physically
 and
 mentally


and
 then
 2019
 I
 think
 I
 just
 had
 a


period
 where
 I
 had
 like
 a
 lot
 of


leftover
 preparation
 from
 the
 world


championship
 in


2018
 I
 couldn't
 really
 that
 2018
 um
 the


match
 was
 all
 draws
 12
 games
 but
 they


were
 extremely
 high
 quality
 so
 when
 I


came
 to
 other
 games
 uh
 other
 tournaments


later
 I
 wasn't
 n
 playing
 that
 one
 game


guy
 all
 the
 time
 so
 uh
 I
 could
 use
 some


of
 the
 preparation
 like
 other
 people


were
 sort
 of
 more
 forgiving
 uh
 so
 I


think
 that
 was
 like
 a
 very
 specific


moment
 and
 also
 that
 was
 the
 start
 of
 AI


in
 chess
 that
 that
 was
 the
 start
 of


people
 working
 with
 uh
 with
 neural
 Nets


so
 that
 gave
 some
 people
 an
 edge
 uh


because
 some
 people
 learned
 how
 to
 work


with
 them
 to
 find
 new
 ideas
 quickly
 uh


and
 so
 like
 in
 in
 a
 few
 months
 time
 you


could
 suddenly
 be
 ahead
 in
 the
 openings


in
 a
 way
 you
 couldn't
 uh
 you
 couldn't
 be


for
 years
 before
 that
 uh
 so
 I
 think
 that


was
 like
 a
 very
 specific
 Moment
 In
 Time


whether
 that
 would
 have
 carried
 on
 a
 bit


in
 2020
 if
 it
 hadn't
 been
 for
 everything


closing
 down
 I'm
 not
 sure
 but
 I
 think


that
 was
 just
 a
 very


specific
 moment
 in
 time
 cuz
 ever
 since


then
 um
 I've
 had
 like
 ups
 and
 downs
 but


my
 level
 has
 been
 quite


consistently
 uh
 a
 little
 bit
 lower
 than


in
 2019
 um
 what
 do
 you
 feel
 about
 ai's


involvement
 in
 chess
 I
 think
 there
 was
 a


very
 specific
 moment
 when
 AI
 was


extremely
 exciting
 for
 players
 and


coaches
 now
 it's
 still
 interesting
 to


see
 especially
 if
 you


compare
 uh
 neural
 Nets
 to
 uh
 traditional


chess
 engines
 and
 also
 hybrid
 engines


how
 differently
 they
 think
 but
 now


everybody
 sort
 of
 has
 their
 same
 tools


so
 working
 with


them
 is
 definitely
 a
 lot


less
 uh
 exciting
 and
 it's
 more
 the
 now


they've
 probably
 um
 contributed
 to


evening
 the
 playing
 field
 even
 more
 what


what
 has
 it
 added
 to
 your
 game
 the
 newer


uh
 neural
 network
 engines
 they've
 uh


definitely
 contributed
 to


um
 the
 way
 that
 I


evaluate
 um
 sort
 of
 time
 and
 material
 I


mean
 broadly
 um
 and
 also
 King


safety
 uh
 my
 view
 on
 the
 importance
 of


King
 safety
 shortterm
 and
 long
 term
 has


changed
 and
 I
 think
 my
 understanding
 has


improved
 so
 much
 since
 2019
 in
 what
 ways


you
 have
 more
 now
 of
 an
 understanding
 of


how


both
 like
 taking
 time
 to
 build
 a
 safe


King
 sacrificing
 material
 to
 weaken
 your


uh
 opponent's
 king
 or
 safeguarding
 your


own
 king
 um
 these
 are
 things
 that
 humans


are
 intuitively
 not
 very
 good
 at
 and


it's
 a
 thing
 that
 engines
 used
 to
 be


even
 worse
 at
 and
 now
 these
 neural
 Nets


they
 understand
 it
 well
 they
 don't


understand
 understand
 but
 they
 do
 it
 so


well


um
 that
 we're
 we're
 learning
 a
 lot
 from


that
 and
 I've
 had
 to


re-evaluate
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 for
 sure


what
 do
 you
 think
 is
 the
 most
 value


aspect
 that
 humans
 can
 still
 add
 to
 this


game
 there
 used
 to
 be
 a
 thing
 called


anti-
 engine
 chess
 I
 don't
 think
 that


would
 work
 anymore
 uh
 supposedly
 like


engines
 did
 not
 play
 well
 in
 closed


positions
 that
 are
 more
 strategical
 less


tactical
 that
 is
 less
 of
 the
 case


anymore
 essentially
 humans
 can
 play


chess
 and
 they
 can
 they
 can
 explain
 to


other
 humans
 what
 the
 engines
 mean
 but
 I


don't
 think
 we
 can
 do
 a
 lot
 more
 than


that
 I
 think
 for
 training
 purposes


having
 a
 human
 touch
 is
 really
 good


still
 but
 honestly
 like
 you
 can
 get


really
 good
 at
 chess
 these


days
 without
 any
 human
 input
 and
 where


do
 you
 where
 do
 you
 think
 this
 will
 take


chess
 over
 the
 next
 decade
 I
 think
 chess


will
 get
 faster
 and
 faster
 at
 a
 high


level
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 this
 is
 direction


that
 we
 we
 were
 going
 to
 go
 but
 I'm
 very


excited
 about
 the
 prospect
 of
 playing


chess
 960
 um
 which
 is
 basically
 that
 the


pieces
 on
 the
 first
 rank
 are
 being
 uh


ran
 randomly
 chosen
 on
 before
 the
 game


so
 you
 end
 up
 with
 playing
 without


opening
 Theory
 and
 I
 find
 that
 extremely


exciting
 to
 play
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 play


with
 longer
 time
 controls
 I
 feel
 now


with
 longer
 time
 controls
 the
 game
 is


just
 a
 bit
 too
 easy
 and
 forgiving
 with


all
 the
 preparation
 you
 have
 but
 overall


yeah
 I
 think
 everything
 that's
 happening


in
 chess
 with
 engines
 and
 preparation
 is


just
 going
 to
 mean
 that
 we
 have
 to
 play


faster
 chess
 in
 order
 for
 there
 to
 be


enough
 room
 to
 both
 show
 your
 strengths


and
 and
 weaknesses
 G
 given
 all
 the
 uh
 AI


uh
 interference
 or
 uh
 uh
 involvement
 in


chess
 are
 you
 surprised
 that
 it's
 still


so
 popular
 and
 people
 find
 it
 so


exciting
 the
 thing
 about
 Chess
 is
 that


it's
 complicated
 but
 it's
 also
 it's
 also


simple
 enough
 I
 think
 people
 like
 that


it's
 relatively
 easy
 to
 to
 not
 to


understand
 but
 but
 to
 play
 also
 I
 think


it's
 as
 simple
 as
 the
 queen
 is
 a
 really


strong


piece
 uh
 people
 like
 like
 that
 the


pieces
 are
 relatively
 powerful
 compared


to
 other
 games


and
 uh
 I
 I
 think
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily


matter
 that
 much
 that
 we're
 so
 terrible


at
 it
 compared
 to
 compared
 to
 engines
 um


it's
 made
 the
 game
 less
 mysterious


serous
 for
 sure
 chess
 players
 used
 to


be
 magicians
 on
 the
 board
 were
 clearly


not
 anymore
 uh
 since
 everybody
 can
 see


now
 what
 we
 do
 right
 and
 what
 we
 do


wrong
 but
 that's
 also
 the
 good
 thing


it's
 made
 it
 more
 accessible
 chess
 used


to
 be
 this
 mystery
 where
 nobody


understood
 what
 was
 going
 on
 like
 humans


sort
 of
 had
 to
 explain
 that
 but
 now


humans
 only
 have
 to
 explain
 why
 um
 the


engine


which


basically
 is
 very
 close
 to
 the
 truth
 why


it's
 showing
 the
 score
 that
 it
 does
 and


this
 means
 that
 people
 can
 follow
 the


score
 and
 honestly
 like
 most
 people


watch
 sports
 or
 games
 for
 entertainment


they
 are
 not
 that
 interested
 in
 all
 the


technical


aspects
 they
 mostly
 want
 to
 watch
 the


score
 to
 see
 what
 who
 wins
 and
 and
 if


it's
 fast
 then
 then
 better
 so
 I
 think


overall


no
 I'm
 not
 particularly
 surprised
 that


chess
 is
 still
 popular
 would
 if
 it
 have


been
 as
 popular
 if
 it
 was
 invented
 now


I'm
 not
 sure
 but
 chess
 has
 such
 a
 rich


historical
 background
 as
 well
 as
 modern


to
 tools
 to
 follow
 it
 so
 I
 think
 um


probably
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 things
 are
 still


in
 store
 last
 few
 questions
 here
 do
 have


you
 ever
 had
 the
 impulser
 syndrome
 I


don't
 consider
 myself
 particularly


brilliant
 genius
 or
 or
 that
 intelligent


so
 yes
 I've
 had
 times
 where
 I've
 seen


people
 whom
 I
 consider
 to
 be
 smarter


than
 I
 am
 do
 worse
 at
 chess


and
 it
 m
 really
 makes
 me
 wonder
 whether


sometimes
 whether
 I'm
 actually
 this
 good


are
 PE
 are
 everybody
 just
 fooling
 me
 um


less
 recently
 I've
 sort
 of
 accepted
 it


more
 now
 but
 I've
 had
 brilliant
 people


talk
 to
 me
 as
 if
 I'm
 the
 smartest
 person


in
 the
 room
 and
 that
 really
 makes
 me


uncomfortable
 because
 I
 see
 myself
 as
 an


intelligent
 but
 not
 brilliant
 guy
 who


happened
 to
 find
 the
 one
 thing
 that
 he


can
 do
 really
 really
 well
 do
 you
 think


this
 mindset
 is
 the
 reason
 why
 you're


being
 so
 successful
 I
 think
 this
 mindset


has
 definitely
 kept
 me
 I
 kept
 me


grounded
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 been
 really


good
 for
 me
 in
 chess
 but
 I
 cannot
 say


that
 this
 or
 that
 is
 the
 reason
 because


I
 don't
 know
 is
 there
 a
 piece
 of
 advice


from
 a
 mentor
 or
 coach
 that
 has
 stuck


with
 you
 forever
 I've
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 good


advice
 over
 the
 years
 but
 I
 think
 maybe


the
 best
 advice
 that
 I
 got
 was
 from
 C


Lan
 at
 a
 fairly
 early
 age
 he
 was
 not
 my


main
 coach
 or
 anything
 but
 we
 would


probably
 meet
 up
 once
 a
 week
 or
 every


two
 weeks
 depending
 on
 whether
 I
 was


playing
 tournaments
 and
 so
 on
 um
 and


then
 we
 would
 go
 through
 some
 of
 my


games
 and
 once
 he
 noticed
 that
 for
 a
 few


black
 games
 in
 a
 row
 I'd
 played
 the
 same


variation
 of
 the
 Sicilian
 Defense
 and
 he


said
 I
 don't
 care
 whether
 you
 consider


this
 to
 be
 good
 or
 a
 bad
 opening
 if


you're
 not
 going
 if
 you're
 not
 going


to
 um
 explore
 then
 you're
 not
 going
 to


learn
 and
 so
 he
 said
 he
 just
 went
 to
 a


shelf
 like
 he's
 he's
 like
 me
 he's
 not
 a


very
 organized
 person
 he
 went
 to
 the


shelf
 and
 he
 said
 said
 this
 book
 this


opening
 learn
 this
 instead
 and
 so
 I


learned
 that
 open
 opening
 I
 tried
 that


in
 the
 next
 game
 then
 I
 then
 I
 tried


something
 tried
 something
 else
 and
 that


thing
 like
 always
 being
 curious
 thinking


about
 learning
 rather
 than
 being
 um


stuck
 in
 in
 sort
 of
 the
 same
 comfortable


patterns
 has
 been
 has
 been
 really


important
 to
 me
 and
 in
 addition
 to
 to


golf
 what
 are
 other
 things
 you're
 trying


to
 learn
 and
 explore
 in
 your
 in
 your


normal
 life
 these
 days
 I'm
 I'm
 trying
 to


learn
 Spanish
 um
 because
 I
 will
 be


moving
 to
 Spain
 after
 a
 bit
 why
 are
 you


moving
 to
 Spain
 because
 of


weather


um
 I've
 I've
 had
 you
 know
 um
 I've
 had
 a


lot
 of
 winters
 in
 Norway
 but
 I
 feel
 like


I'm
 privileged
 enough
 that
 I


can
 I
 can
 sort
 of
 choose
 more
 where
 to


to
 live
 I
 still
 want
 to
 spend
 time
 in


Norway
 but
 I
 probably
 don't
 want
 to


spend
 six
 months
 of
 winter
 here
 but


apart
 from
 that
 I
 have
 fairly
 Simple


Pleasures
 in
 in
 life
 so
 I
 had
 times
 last


year
 where
 I
 thought
 that
 I
 was
 going
 to


try
 and
 carve
 out
 sort
 of
 a
 new
 career


path
 that
 I
 could
 pursue
 at
 the
 same


time
 as
 chess
 but
 so
 far
 I
 haven't


really
 found
 it
 and
 also
 so
 far
 I


haven't
 been
 any
 less
 happy
 because
 of


it
 now
 last
