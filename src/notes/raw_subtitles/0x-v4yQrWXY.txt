As
 a
 founder,
 you
 just
 have
 this


instinct
 for
 some
 market.
 That's
 the


hard
 thing
 about
 being
 an
 entrepreneur,


being
 a
 founder
 is
 like
 most
 people
 are


not
 going
 to
 believe
 in
 what
 you're


trying
 to
 do
 until
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 they


do.
 I
 loved
 the
 idea
 of
 the
 product
 that


we
 were
 building.
 As
 long
 as
 I
 feel


really
 happy
 about
 the
 customers
 that
 we


have
 and
 they're
 happy,
 then
 that's
 like


the
 validation
 I'm
 in
 search
 of.
 You


have
 to
 just
 like
 stay
 the
 course
 and


keep
 going
 and
 keep
 showing
 up
 even
 if


you
 know
 it's
 hard
 and
 even
 if
 you
 have


doubts
 and
 moments,
 you
 just
 have
 to


like
 keep
 going.


My
 name
 is
 Dylan
 Fox.
 I'm
 the
 founder


and
 CEO
 of
 Assembly
 AI.
 We've
 built
 the


industry's
 most
 accurate
 and
 easiest
 to


use
 developer
 platform
 for
 speech
 AI.


We've
 raised
 over
 $130
 million
 in


funding
 to
 date
 from
 Excel
 Insight


Partners
 Daniel
 Gross
 and
 Nat
 Freeman


and
 Smith
 Point.
 That's
 led
 by
 Keith


Block
 from
 Salesforce.


My
 older
 brother,
 he
 would
 order
 all
 the


hardware
 online
 and
 he
 would,
 you
 know,


be
 in
 our
 basement
 making
 computers
 and


I
 would
 watch
 him
 and
 being
 around


computers
 as
 a
 kid
 playing
 video
 games.


I
 was
 addicted
 to
 these
 MMRPG
 games.
 I


love
 just
 working
 on
 technology.
 So
 in


college,
 I
 started
 this
 company
 that


helped
 other
 college
 organizations
 fund


raise
 online
 and
 people
 that
 donated
 to


this
 student
 organization
 would
 get
 like


local
 rewards
 in
 their
 community.
 It
 was


a
 terrible
 idea
 and
 it
 was,
 you
 know,


didn't
 go
 anywhere.
 But
 we
 learned
 a
 lot


about
 starting
 company
 and
 being
 a


founder
 through
 that
 experience.
 What
 I


learned
 from
 that
 experience
 was
 that
 I


loved
 being
 a
 founder
 and
 I
 loved


programming.
 And
 with
 programming,
 it


wasn't
 so
 much
 the
 programming
 that
 was


addictive.
 It
 was
 just
 this
 open-ended


world
 that
 you
 could
 just
 build
 stuff.


Any
 idea
 you
 had
 with
 programming,
 you


could
 make
 it
 into
 something
 real
 and


then
 you
 could
 get
 feedback
 from
 users


and
 you
 could
 then
 keep
 building
 and


keep
 building.
 And
 so
 it
 was
 this


process
 of
 like
 building
 something
 that


I
 found
 just
 so
 addictive.
 So
 after


college,
 I
 didn't
 get
 a
 job.
 Uh
 we
 had


shut
 the
 startup
 down.
 I
 just
 opened
 up


a
 bunch
 of
 credit
 cards
 and
 I
 went
 like


$30,000
 into
 credit
 card
 debt.
 Basically


just
 like
 learning
 how
 to
 program
 and


like
 reading
 programming
 books
 and


building
 apps
 and
 just
 like
 all
 day.


That's
 what
 I
 would
 do
 in
 my
 apartment.


And
 I
 would
 make
 like
 one
 big
 bowl
 of


pasta
 every
 Sunday
 and
 just
 like
 eat


that
 all
 week
 with
 Diet
 Coke.
 As
 I
 was


just
 like
 spending
 all
 day
 just


programming
 and
 building
 stuff
 and


seeing
 if
 I
 could
 launch
 anything
 new.


After,
 you
 know,
 almost
 2
 years
 of
 doing


that
 and
 going
 into
 credit
 card
 debt,
 I


was
 like,
 "Okay,
 I
 need
 to
 go
 get
 a


job."
 But
 I
 had
 found
 that
 I
 was
 really


most
 interested
 in
 machine
 learning
 and


natural
 language
 processing.
 And
 so


there
 was
 a
 team
 in
 San
 Francisco,
 the


company
 called
 Cisco
 that
 was
 hiring
 for


machine
 learning
 engineers
 to
 focus
 on


building
 natural
 language
 processing


products
 and
 interfaces
 around
 Cisco's


collaboration
 products.
 Got
 really
 into


neural
 networks
 and
 more
 advanced


machine
 learning
 and
 deep
 learning
 while


I
 was
 out
 there
 at
 that
 job.
 And
 that


was
 like
 2015
 2016
 time


when
 I
 when
 I
 got
 the
 job
 at
 Cisco
 and
 I


knew
 I
 always
 wanted
 to
 start
 another


company.
 I'd
 always
 spend
 nights
 and


weekends
 just
 still
 tinkering
 with


random
 ideas
 I
 would
 have.
 And
 I
 think


the
 Alexa
 launched
 around
 the
 time
 I
 was


in
 Cisco.
 So
 the
 Alexa
 product
 was
 like


the
 first
 computer
 you
 could
 talk
 to.


And
 I
 as
 a
 machine
 learning
 engineer


that
 was
 working
 in
 natural
 language


processing.
 I
 wanted
 to
 start


experimenting
 with
 my
 own
 ideas
 for


voice
 interfaces
 or
 voice
 products,


voice
 driven
 products.
 And
 the
 leading


company
 at
 the
 time
 that
 was
 building


that
 technology
 was
 this
 big
 company.


And
 I
 contacted
 them
 to
 try
 to
 get


access
 to
 their
 developer
 SDK.
 And
 they


mailed
 me
 a
 CDROM.
 It
 was
 like
 a
 $10,000


evaluation
 agreement
 that
 you
 had
 to


sign.
 I
 didn't
 even
 have
 a
 CDROM
 drive


to
 like
 load
 their
 SDKs.
 It
 was
 just


this
 complete
 archaic
 experience.
 As
 a


developer,
 I
 really
 wanted
 this
 super


accurate,
 really
 easy
 to
 use
 developer


platform
 because
 I
 saw
 back
 then
 that


the
 technology
 was
 going
 to
 just
 get


orders
 of
 magnitude
 better
 and
 that
 was


going
 to
 make
 what
 was
 a
 small
 market


huge.
 That
 was
 a
 really
 exciting
 thing


that
 I
 just
 wanted
 to
 build
 and
 work
 on.


as
 a
 founder,
 you
 just
 have
 this


instinct
 for
 some
 market
 and
 that's
 what


gets
 you
 excited
 about
 working
 in
 that


market
 or
 building
 in
 that
 market.
 And


so
 for
 me,
 that
 instinct
 was
 voice


interfaces
 and
 speech
 AI
 technology.


That
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important


modalities
 for
 AI.
 And
 so
 we're
 really


excited
 about
 that
 potential
 and


especially
 that
 potential
 to
 create


really
 accurate
 and
 amazing
 AI
 for


speech
 and
 voice
 and
 then
 just
 put
 it


into
 the
 hands
 of
 developers
 to
 build


really
 creative
 stuff
 with
 and
 really


amazing
 apps
 with.


I
 left
 my
 job
 and
 then
 a
 few
 months


later
 got
 into
 Y
 Combinator.
 I
 had
 no


clue
 I
 was
 going
 to
 get
 into
 Y


Combinator.
 I
 just
 wanted
 to
 submit
 the


application
 as
 really
 a
 thought
 exercise


to
 like
 crystallize
 what
 I
 was
 working


on,
 what
 I
 was
 going
 to
 do.
 You
 know,
 I


figured
 like
 no
 chance
 I'm
 getting
 in


alone.
 No
 progress,
 no
 traction,
 no


product,
 just
 an
 idea.
 But
 there
 was
 a


YC
 partner
 at
 the
 time,
 Daniel
 Gross,


who
 had
 worked
 at
 Apple,
 had
 worked


around
 Siri,
 got
 an
 email,
 it's
 like,


"Hey,
 what's
 your
 accuracy
 rate
 from


Daniel?"
 And
 then
 the
 next
 day
 they
 were


like, "Hey,
 we'd
 love
 you
 to
 come
 in
 for


an
 interview."
 And
 so
 I
 bought
 a
 ticket


home.
 I
 flew
 back
 to
 San
 Francisco
 where


I
 was
 living
 at
 the
 time.
 The
 next
 day,


drove
 down
 to
 to
 Y
 Combinator
 for
 the


interview,
 got
 in
 and
 I'd
 submitted
 the


application.
 It
 was
 like
 30
 days
 late,


past
 the
 deadline.
 I
 went
 in
 the
 first


day
 and
 it
 was
 like
 all
 these
 other


companies
 had
 so
 much
 progress,
 so
 much


traction,
 and
 I
 was
 just
 getting
 started


and
 it
 was
 a
 really
 hard
 idea
 to
 get


started
 with
 like
 creating
 AI
 models
 for


speech.
 That
 was
 probably
 one
 of the


most
 stressful
 periods
 of
 my
 life.
 It


was
 like
 those
 those
 three
 months
 in
 YC


where
 I
 was
 just
 like
 really
 trying
 to


get
 things
 off
 the
 ground
 working
 mostly


by
 myself.
 A
 lot
 of
 founders
 think
 that


getting
 into
 Y
 Combinator
 raising


capital
 is
 like
 just
 going
 to
 make


things
 happen.
 It
 doesn't.
 No
 investors


are
 going
 to
 hand
 you
 customers,
 make


your
 product
 better,
 fix
 things.
 You


still
 have
 to
 make
 everything
 happen.
 So


we
 just
 again
 like
 showed
 up
 every
 day


and
 just
 tried
 to
 make
 progress
 and
 just


like
 kept
 at
 it.
 I've
 really
 just
 tried


to
 focus
 on
 is
 like
 as
 long
 as
 I
 feel


really
 happy
 about
 the
 product
 that


we're
 making
 and
 the
 customers
 that
 we


have
 and
 they're
 happy,
 then
 that's
 like


the
 validation
 I'm
 in
 search
 of
 is
 do
 I


feel
 happy
 about
 our
 product?
 Are


customers
 happy?
 Like
 those
 are
 the


things
 I
 try
 to
 get
 validation
 from,
 not


what
 do
 other
 people
 think
 about
 our


company
 or
 what
 we're
 doing.


As
 a
 founder,
 you
 already
 know
 ideas
 are


the
 easy
 part.
 It's
 the
 execution,


actually
 building
 the
 product,
 that


slows
 everything
 down.
 That's
 where


Lovable
 comes
 in.
 It's
 not
 just
 an
 AI


tool.
 It's
 your
 ondemand
 engineering


team.
 Simply
 describe
 your
 idea.
 Lovable


then
 builds
 a
 full
 frontend,
 backend,


and
 database
 so
 you
 can
 launch
 real


production
 ready
 software
 without


writing
 code.
 It's
 already
 powering
 over


a
 100,000
 new
 products
 a
 day,
 helping


2.5
 million
 builders
 turn
 ideas
 into


software
 just
 by
 describing
 what
 they


want.
 No
 devs,
 no
 delays,
 no
 excuses.


They're
 launching
 in
 weeks,
 not
 months.


And
 guess
 what?
 These
 teams
 are
 still


tiny.
 In
 fact,
 team
 EO
 is
 also
 using


Lovable
 to
 build
 our
 upcoming
 EOS
 school


platform,
 and
 we're
 loving
 it.

Most
 of
 my
 day
 is
 spent
 talking
 to


customers,
 working
 with
 our
 product


teams,
 playing
 with
 our
 product,
 and


seeing
 where
 it's
 working,
 where
 it's


not.
 founders
 and
 and
 startups,
 you


really
 need
 to
 have
 this
 deep
 deep


subject
 matter
 expertise
 in
 your
 market


and
 in
 your
 customers
 in
 your
 product.
 I


think
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 ways
 it's
 like


undervalued
 and
 underappreciated
 versus


functional
 expertise.
 Don't
 always
 have


a
 lot
 of
 confidence
 in
 your
 functional


expertise.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 where


startups
 can
 win.
 You
 know,
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 people
 out
 there
 that
 have


amazing
 functional
 expertise,
 but
 don't


have
 the
 deep
 subject
 matter
 expertise


that
 you
 have
 or
 that
 your
 team
 has
 over


a
 certain
 market
 or
 a
 certain
 customer


or
 product.
 And
 so,
 when
 I
 talk
 to


customers,
 I
 don't
 want
 the
 flattery.
 I


want
 like
 where
 does
 our
 product
 suck?


Some
 of
 the
 questions
 I
 ask
 are
 like,


hey,
 what
 are
 the
 top
 three
 things
 that


you
 don't
 like
 about
 our
 product?
 Or
 if


you
 were
 in
 charge
 of
 our
 road
 map,
 what


would
 you
 prioritize?
 Those
 types
 of


questions
 are
 really
 helpful
 because,


you
 know,
 they
 give
 you
 that
 feedback


and
 that
 insight
 over
 like
 where
 do
 you


need
 to
 continue
 to
 push.
 I'm
 never


satisfied
 with
 our
 progress.
 I
 really


excited
 about
 what
 our
 customers
 are


building.
 Like
 I
 see
 some
 of
 the
 apps


they
 launch
 and
 they
 build
 and
 it's
 like


like
 I
 want
 to
 go
 talk
 about
 them
 with


my
 friends
 cuz
 they're
 so
 cool
 and


inspiring
 and
 exciting.
 And
 as
 all
 these


new
 applications
 around
 speech
 are


continuing
 to
 take
 off,
 the
 amount
 of


speech
 data
 we're
 handling
 it
 just


continues
 to
 grow
 rapidly.
 We'll
 handle


this
 month
 alone
 about
 five
 pabytes
 of


speech
 data
 through
 our
 API
 platform.


That's
 about
 10x
 the
 size
 of
 the
 entire


Spotify
 library
 and
 catalog.
 And
 usage


to
 our
 developer
 platform
 is
 growing


over
 250%


year-over-year.
 So,
 the
 scale
 is
 like


pretty
 insane.


Speed
 is
 probably
 more
 important
 now


than
 ever.
 There's
 so
 many
 use
 cases


that
 we're
 seeing
 developers
 want
 to


build
 apps
 around
 that
 they
 need
 really


good
 speech
 AI
 for.
 They
 need
 new


capabilities.
 They
 need
 better
 tech.


They
 need
 better
 models.
 They
 need,
 you


know,
 all
 this
 stuff.
 They're
 hungry
 for


it
 because
 the
 opportunities
 are


enormous.
 An
 example
 of
 where
 a
 lot
 of


speech
 AI
 models
 will
 struggle
 today
 is


with
 hallucinations.
 So
 having
 an


in-person
 meeting
 with
 10
 people
 or


you're
 having
 a
 phone
 call
 and
 it's


windy
 and
 the
 quality
 is
 bad,
 that's


where
 the
 AI
 models
 still
 do
 struggle


today.
 And
 that's
 an
 amazing
 opportunity


because
 there's
 so
 many
 applications


that
 are
 limited
 by
 those
 things.
 And
 so


we're
 really
 excited
 to
 keep
 making
 the


models
 that
 we're
 creating
 better
 and


better.
 And
 as
 a
 startup
 company,
 you


want
 to
 try
 to
 optimize
 everything
 you


can
 for
 speed.
 You
 can
 start
 by
 just


putting
 up
 a
 website
 and
 advertising
 the


product
 that
 you
 want
 to
 build
 and
 just


putting
 like
 a,
 you
 know,
 contact
 us


button
 on
 there
 and
 see
 what
 are
 people


reaching
 out
 about,
 are
 people
 reaching


out,
 what
 do
 they
 want
 from
 your
 product


and
 that
 can
 be
 really
 helpful
 to
 get


validation
 early
 on
 are
 you
 building
 the


right
 thing
 uh
 before
 you
 go
 spend
 a
 ton


of
 time
 building.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 really


fast
 iteration
 loop
 is
 important
 for


startups
 to
 have
 with
 customers
 and
 the


markets
 that
 you're
 you're
 working
 in.


When
 you're
 making
 an
 AI
 model
 like
 at


so
 many
 points
 you
 have
 to
 decide


between
 trade-offs,
 right?
 What
 type
 of


data
 do
 you
 use?
 What
 type
 of
 thing
 do


you
 optimize
 for?
 When
 you
 know
 who


you're
 building
 this
 AI
 model
 for,
 then


you
 can
 make
 all
 those
 trade-offs
 a
 lot


more
 intelligently
 in
 a
 way
 that
 makes


your
 AI
 model
 have
 more
 product
 market


fit
 for
 who
 you're
 building
 it
 for.
 You


can
 always
 change
 your
 focus
 as
 you


learn,
 right?
 But
 I
 think
 it's
 important


to
 like
 have
 a
 focus
 and
 then
 you
 learn


and
 then
 you
 can
 focus
 other
 areas.
 like


we're
 super
 laser
 focused
 on,
 okay,


people
 building
 voice
 agents,
 people


building
 notetakers,
 people
 building


sales
 intelligence
 apps,
 these
 are
 the


10
 things
 they
 really,
 really
 care


about.
 And
 so,
 let's
 make
 sure
 our


models
 are
 hyper
 optimized
 for
 those


things.
 And
 let's
 build
 the
 right


training
 data
 and
 let's
 build
 the
 right


model
 architectures
 and
 let's
 do
 all
 of


the
 things
 we
 can
 to
 absolutely
 max
 out


in
 those
 dimensions.
 And
 that's
 how


we're
 constantly
 keeping
 our
 models
 the


most
 accurate
 and
 the
 easiest
 to
 use
 for


the
 developers
 that
 we're
 building
 for.


You
 might
 come
 to
 assembly
 and
 maybe
 our


models
 aren't
 as
 good
 for
 you
 as
 another


model.
 And
 usually
 if
 that
 happens,
 it's


because
 that's
 not
 an
 application
 or
 a


use
 case
 that
 we're
 really
 focusing
 on.


At least
 not
 right
 now.
 So
 for
 us,
 the


way
 we
 really
 maintain
 our
 competitive


advantage
 is
 by
 just
 really
 clearly


focusing
 on
 who
 we're
 building
 for
 and


not
 building
 general
 purpose
 tech,
 but


building
 tech
 that's
 optimized
 for
 a


specific
 use
 case
 and
 market.


One
 of
 the
 biggest
 things
 I've
 learned


is
 that
 every
 startup,
 you
 have
 your
 own


journey.
 It's
 easy
 to
 compare
 yourself


to
 other
 startups.
 you
 know,
 you
 have


friends
 that
 are
 founders
 and
 maybe


they're
 a
 stage
 or
 two
 ahead.
 But


startups
 are
 not
 franchise
 businesses,
 I


think,
 is
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 things
 that


I've
 learned.
 And
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 that
 is


like
 you
 have
 to
 really
 figure
 out
 what


your
 journey
 is.
 And
 every
 journey
 is


slightly
 different.
 And
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


startup
 dogma
 that
 you
 don't
 have
 to


subscribe
 to.
 and
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 ways
 can


actually
 make
 it
 harder
 for
 you
 as
 a


founder
 because
 you
 feel
 like
 there's


all
 this
 stuff
 you
 have
 to
 do
 when
 in


reality
 you
 just
 have
 to
 really
 build
 a


great
 product,
 make
 your
 customers
 happy


and
 that's
 what
 you
 want
 to
 focus
 on.


That
 realization
 has
 helped
 me
 a
 lot
 as


a
 founder
 realizing,
 okay,
 we're
 on
 our


our
 own
 journey.
 Startups
 are
 all
 look


different.
 All
 their
 journeys
 are


different.
 And
 just
 be
 really
 focused
 on


making
 a
 great
 product,
 on
 making


customers
 super
 happy.
 And
 that's
 that's


the
 north
 star.
