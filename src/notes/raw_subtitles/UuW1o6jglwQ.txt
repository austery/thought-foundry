>> Hey, Adam, how's it going?
Good, thanks.
>> Thanks so much for joining
us. I thought we would meet in
a park. Since we're talking
about trees, it seems adequate.
Let's start with the basics.
What is nature based solution?
>> Yeah, so a nature based
solution is when we use nature
intentionally to address some
kind of societal challenge.
So the challenges can vary.
You can lots of problems to
solve for society, but so you
can kind of do it either.
There's typically three
different types of nature based
solutions where you can either
restore nature that's already
there, just conserve nature
that's there, or just, you know,
install an entirely new park
or create a whole new forest.
So build something from scratch.
>> You make this argument of
intentionality that we need to
start thinking about nature
based solutions. Why is it
important in urban areas like
the one that we're in? We're in
the city of Toronto right now.
We are in a park. But why is it
important that we think about
it?
>> I think it's especially
important in urban areas,
because these natural
environments provide a lot of
benefits to people, and these
benefits can range from
providing an area for
recreation or just a
comfortable area to sit
outdoors. Like right now, it's,
you know, a lot more
comfortable temperature here
than if we were in the middle
of the street, something like
that. So and there's a lot of
competing interests in urban
environments, which makes it
tricky. You know, lots of
people want to develop housing,
build stores.
So the intentional part is
especially key because there's
a lot of competing interests
for land uses.
>> All right. I want to break
down where we can use nature
based solutions when we think
about climate adaptation.
So we're going to throw some
things at you. Sure. Extreme
heat. That sounds like an
obvious one, but how do trees
and nature help with that.
>> Yeah. So multiple ways.
So if we just take a tree as an
example. So there's something
called evapotranspiration that
kind of works similar to how
people sweat. Right.
So it helps kind of cool off
the surrounding environment.
Also of course trees tend to
provide quite a lot of shade.
Shade makes things a lot more
comfortable as well. And they
tend to absorb a lot less heat
than built infrastructure.
So as I talked about earlier,
with the road, the road's going
to absorb a lot more heat and
people are going to feel
a lot more heat compared to
if they're next to a tree.
For example.
>> Let's talk flooding.
>> Yes.
>> How does nature based
solutions help with flooding?
>> Yeah. So in a similar way.
So I guess coming back to the
evapotranspiration part.
So trees will absorb a lot of
stormwater. So if there's a
huge storm then all the trees
will absorb that water through
their root system and then
gradually evaporate that water
into the atmosphere. Of course
they use some for their own
growth as well. Also, just if
you think of like lawns or
soils, that permeability
compared to like a road surface
really helps absorb the
stormwater. So it stops all the
stormwater from like
overloading the pipes, for
example, where you can allow it
to just slowly percolate back
into the groundwater system.
>> I'm imagining astroturf is
not something that we love so
much.
>> Yeah, it doesn't have all
the same benefits. Okay.
>> Air pollution.
>> Yeah, that's another way.
So if you can continuing with
the example of a tree. Right.
So some air pollutants will
actually be absorbed directly
into the tree. So the tree is
like breathing for example.
But a whole bunch of other ones
like particulate matter will
temporarily get attached to
the tree's surface.
>> So what are we talking about.
Particulate matter.
>> You might see on some like
air pollution metrics like PM
2.5 or something like that.
So this stuff's really bad for
you if you inhale. So whenever
like forest fires the past few
years when we get that smoke in
this area, you'll be able to
see like the particulate matter
increasing. And you can feel
that when it gets pretty high
it's much harder to breathe.
But some of that actually
attaches to the tree and then
will slowly get pulled out of
the air.
>> All right.
We know that trees are pretty
and that there are
they are home for wildlife.
but do people think do
most people know that they have
these climate adaptations
that you sort of mentioned,
or is it just sort of something
to enjoy
and look at?
>> Yeah,
I think
I mean, it's going to depend
on the person, right?
Some people are a lot more
familiar
and aware of it than others.
speaking from I guess from
the municipality's perspective,
I think a lot of times
they will have quite
a bit idea of these things,
but they're not always
measuring them explicitly.
So they might
they're gonna have people
working there
who know that trees provide
a whole bunch of benefits,
and they're trying to promote
trees,
but they're not necessarily
measuring
all these things
I've talked about,
like how much it helps
with flooding or air pollution.
>> Does there need to be? Do we
need to do a better job at sort
of bringing the awareness of
not only trees, but other sort
of nature based solutions to
the general public?
>> I mean, bias for me, but
yeah, I think so. I think that
we are gradually getting a lot
better. So I think compared to
like 20 years ago, just from me
reading the literature and
being more familiar with it,
these types of topics and
themes are really becoming a
lot more popular, particularly
with climate change, when we're
trying to figure out how we can
adapt to extreme heat and
flooding, especially heat. I'm
sure everyone here, like we all,
recognize that it's getting
warmer and warmer over time,
so being able to use nature
intentionally can really help
in that way. And I think some
people might be like implicitly
aware of these things, like,
you know, they might enjoy
spending time in the park,
but they just it might not
necessarily click about
all the benefits that
are being provided.
>> What do we need to do
to bridge that little high gap?
>> I think education starting
honestly
like from elementary school.
Right.
I think like outdoor education
can be something really
important.
I always loved being outdoor
growing up as a kid,
and I think
just starting to reconnect,
like,
I remember
even when I was,
like,
I started learning about climate
change
and like, primary school
when I was younger.
And these types of things can,
you know, we can connect to
solutions,
talk about.
It's really easy to connect to,
like,
you know, pointing the kids
while you spend time outdoors.
Well,
do you like being in some places
more than others? And why is
that?
>> I want to talk regulations,
okay. What's available for
developers and planners to sort
of incorporate nature
when they build?
>> Yeah. So there's a whole lot
that can go into that.
The one thing that I tend to
highlight from my past study
is green development standards,
which is something that's
starting to become a lot more
popular in Ontario.
So it started in like
the mid like 2000 to 2010 like
in there, and it's gradually
expanded out to about 14
municipalities now, maybe a
little more. Some have been
implemented in the past few
months I'm not aware of.
But yeah. So these types of
standards allow people when
they're proposing to build like
a new subdivision or something
like that, or a new condo
building, how they can make
sure that the development is
more environmentally friendly,
like sustainable. So it factors
in aspects related to climate
change mitigation and
adaptation.
>> You mentioned 14
municipalities. There's over
400 in this province, so I'm
sure we're a bit short there in
terms of reaching some goals.
How do different municipalities
go and create their own green
development standards?
>> Yeah. So there's a there's
some wider partnerships.
So like the Clean Air
Partnership is an organization
that's really helped some
municipalities bring these
forward. I think now that there
are a lot of examples, people
will then look toward the other
municipalities that have
already successfully
implemented them.
So the Toronto Green Standard
was one of the earliest
standards that were implemented.
And I know that a lot of other
municipalities have referenced
that standard when they're
creating their own.
So I think just looking toward
other examples and building up
from there.
>> So you mentioned Toronto,
obviously in Toronto.
Tell us how the city is working
on their standards and how
they're sort of incentivising
developers to consider nature
in their planning?
>> Yeah, no, that's a good
point. So Toronto is actually
one unique in a sense where
they actually provide
incentives, financial
incentives for developers to go
beyond minimum requirements,
to try to get them to do things
that are more sustainable.
So an example is that so I guess
the Toronto Green Standard, you
start out there's a tier one.
So it's a tiered system.
And with tier one that's just a
requirement for all development
applications that come to the
city. But then beyond that
there's tiers two and three.
And those are actually optional.
But if you achieve those
metrics then you get a
development charge rebate as
part of the development.
So there is a financial
incentive for people to go
beyond that.
And some of the examples of the
more optional components, one
would be like if you try to
quantify how much carbon is
stored in the landscape.
So if you try to do a good job,
like incorporating vegetation
and having try to help reduce
greenhouse gases created from
the development so you can get
extra credit for that.
>> Now.
Sounds obvious that,
you know, most developers would
go to,
you know, tier two and three
because there's some money
and some savings there.
Do we know if they're working in
Toronto?
>> So there I would say
most developers
don't try to achieve above the
tier
one minimum standard.
that's something that
the city has already realized.
And they're trying to up the
amount
of development charge
rebate that you get.
So they noticed
I can't remember the dates
exactly,
but they're so they're upping
the
the amount that you would get in
rebate.
So yeah, currently
I'd say there's a challenge
from trying
to get developers
to go above the minimum
requirements.
And that's where I think
having realistic minimum
requirements that do achieve
like positive environmental
outcomes
is really important.
>> Since we're talking about
tiers,
I think it's important
if we're talking about
municipalities,
let's go up a tier.
Let's talk about the province.
Should there be more of
a province wide standard
for nature based solutions?
>> Yeah, I think that would be
helpful because I think
municipalities look toward the
province for what they consider
important. So we have something
called the provincial planning
statement in Ontario.
What's that. And then so that's
something that's updated
semi-regularly. The last time
it was updated was in 2024.
So last year. And that provides
the policy guidelines for all
municipalities to follow.
So then municipalities will then
use their own official plans
or zoning bylaws that as long
as they conform with that
provincial planning statement.
So that kind of sets out the
broad agenda for municipalities.
And and it covers a whole bunch
of different aspects, like how
you should protect people from
natural hazards. So protect
development from natural
hazards or, you know, just
build things more energy
efficient, support transit
these types of things. But then
another part of that is also it
promotes like green
infrastructure, which is, you
know, the trees that we're
talking about.
>> Is there more that can be
done with that or just looking
at it? You mentioned sort of
the swath of of sort of
guidelines on there.
Is it specific enough?
Is it intentional in the way
that we talk about
nature based solutions?
>> I think it could be far more
intentional with how it
supports nature based solutions,
because it's it's supportive in
the sense that it encourages
people to try to incorporate
green infrastructure, low
impact development, these types
of things that encourage,
you know, using nature based
solutions. But it could
definitely do a better job by,
I guess, directly connecting
that to like societal
challenges that we have and
encouraging those nature based
solutions to be intentionally
used to combat specific
problems.
>> When we talk about
regulations, developers across
this province are probably like,
great, more red tape, more
things that we need to go
through. The city of Toronto
recently had updated and
introduced thermal comfort
guidelines. Another example of,
you know, thinking about how we
as this planet gets warmer,
how we can incorporate it.
But one of the things that
criticisms were
do these things have teeth?
Will they stand?
And also, can we, in this
housing crisis that we have
have more regulations?
Can we handle more?
>> Yeah, I think that's
honestly going to be a question
that never goes away. I think
there's going to be a constant
tension between, you know,
what's considered red tape
versus what are required
studies like required
components of development.
I think that's something that
will be constantly negotiated
into the future. And that's a
key part of planning.
So I think as we recognize
different benefits of different
ways that we build, you know,
our standards will evolve
like what we want to achieve.
So for example, you know,
30 years ago, no one was really
talking about building
net zero homes, right?
And now that's something that's
going to be in the building
code soon. That's something
that's supported by the current
provincial planning statement.
>> I live in a neighbourhood
in the city where I wish there
were more trees. I see a lot of
concretes, and I'm sure there
are lots of people who might be
listening or watching this and
go like, well, you know, more
trees, more forests means more
wildlife, more maintenance,
more headaches, more problems.
What do you say to those people
who can't get past those
initial barriers?
>> Yeah, I would say that's
where it comes back to the
education component. I think
where we can really share and
emphasis that there's pros,
there's not only cons. Right.
So I mean there are definitely
always going to be some cons,
right. Like, you know, branches
will fall and damage property.
People will have to clean up
leaves, these types of things.
But there are still those
benefits that I think are
important to emphasis and
reinforce.
>> I myself love raking my
leaves, so I will always be out
enjoying that. Adam, thank you
so much. This was really
insightful. Really appreciate
it.
>> Awesome. Yeah.
>> Thank you for having me.
