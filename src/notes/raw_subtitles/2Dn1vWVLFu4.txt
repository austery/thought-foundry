Thank
 you
 very
 much
 um
 your
 royal


highness
 crown
 prince
 Hulkon.
 Thank
 you


very
 much.
 I
 look
 forward
 to
 meeting


with
 you
 later
 and
 thank
 you
 by
 the
 way


for
 your
 own
 personal
 commitment
 on
 the


climate
 issue.
 It's
 quite
 important
 to


Eda
 Waldenbotch
 the
 governor
 and
 chair


of
 Georgia
 Bank
 Nikolai
 Tangen.
 Thank


you
 for
 inviting
 me
 Nikolai.
 I
 am


honored
 to
 be
 here
 especially
 it
 is
 an


honor
 to
 share
 the
 stage
 with
 Christine


Lagard.
 That
 was
 a
 brilliant
 speech


really
 and
 truly
 it
 was
 out
 outstanding


and
 um
 Sher
 Christine
 we
 have
 become


very
 very
 close
 friends
 over
 the
 years


and
 it's
 an
 honor
 to
 be
 here
 with
 you


and
 Kristen
 Halverson
 thank
 you
 very


much
 look
 forward
 to
 the
 conversation


after
 these
 remarks.
 It's
 a
 great


pleasure
 to
 be
 back
 here
 in
 Oslo.
 I've


been
 here
 for
 three
 days
 and
 one
 of
 the


first
 questions
 I've
 received
 uh
 from


friends
 that
 I
 meet
 here
 is
 about
 Donald


Trump.
 I
 don't
 intend
 to
 talk
 about


Donald
 Trump
 today,
 but
 I
 met
 with
 a


friend
 who
 is
 a
 Norwegian
 businessman


who
 does
 business
 uh
 in
 the
 United


States,
 and
 I
 asked
 him
 how
 he
 felt


about
 Trump's
 policies
 and
 decisions.


And
 he
 said,
 "I
 feel
 fine."
 And
 there


was
 something
 about
 the
 way
 he
 said
 it


that
 reminded
 me
 of
 a
 story
 that
 I
 heard


actually
 40
 years
 ago.
 I
 come
 from


Nashville,
 Tennessee.
 the
 home
 of


country
 music
 and
 the
 Grand
 Old
 Opry.


And
 back
 in
 those
 days,
 they
 had
 a


comedian
 named
 Cousin
 Mini
 Pearl
 who


wore
 a
 calico
 dress
 and
 a
 straw
 hat
 with


the
 price
 tag
 still
 hanging
 from
 the


hat.
 And
 she
 she
 had
 homespun
 rural


humor.
 And
 she
 told
 a
 story.
 I
 was


driving
 back
 to
 my
 farm
 after
 a
 day
 of


town
 hall
 meetings
 as
 a
 young


congressman.


and
 she
 told
 about
 a
 farmer
 who
 was


involved
 in
 an
 accident
 and
 he
 sued
 the


other
 driver
 for
 damages.
 And
 when
 the


other
 driver's
 lawyer
 had
 the
 chance
 to


cross-examine
 this
 farmer,
 he
 said,


"Now,
 isn't
 it
 true
 that
 immediately


after
 this
 accident,
 you
 said,
 "I
 feel


fine."
 And
 the
 farmer
 said,
 "Well,
 it's


not
 that
 simple.
 You
 see,
 I
 was
 driving


my
 cow
 to
 town
 in
 the
 back
 of
 my
 truck,


and
 this
 fell
 came
 driving
 across
 the


center
 of
 the
 highway,
 and
 the
 lawyer


said,
 "I
 object,
 your
 honor.
 We
 don't


want
 to
 hear
 a
 long
 involved
 story.
 Just


answer
 the
 question,
 yes
 or
 no.
 Did
 you


or
 did
 you
 not
 say
 immediately
 after
 the


accident,
 I
 feel
 fine."


Farmer
 said,
 "Well,
 I
 was
 leading
 up
 to


that.
 You
 see,
 I
 was
 driving
 my
 cow
 to


town
 in
 the
 back
 of
 my
 truck,
 and
 this


fell
 came
 driving
 across
 the
 center
 line


and
 ran
 right
 smack
 dab
 into
 my
 truck


and
 knocked
 it
 over
 and
 threw
 me
 out
 and


threw
 the
 cow
 out.
 I
 was
 on
 one
 side
 and


the
 cow
 was
 on
 the
 other
 and
 the


policeman
 came
 up
 and
 took
 one
 look
 at


that
 cow
 and
 said,
 "She
 is
 suffering."


Pulled
 out
 his
 gun
 and
 shot
 her
 right


between
 the
 eyes.


Came
 around
 to
 my
 side
 of
 the
 truck
 and


said,
 "How
 do
 you
 feel?"
 And
 uh


so


there
 was
 something
 about
 the


businessman's
 comment
 that
 reminded
 me


of
 that


story.


Well,
 there's
 no
 doubt
 that
 we're
 at
 a
 a


critical
 moment
 in
 the
 global


sustainability
 transition
 and
 it's


always
 faced
 significant
 headwinds.
 But


as
 uh
 uh
 President
 Lagarde
 has
 very


eloquently
 said,
 those
 headwinds
 have


become
 stronger
 and
 everybody
 knows
 it.


Uh
 at
 at
 my
 investment
 firm,
 Generation


Investment
 Manager,
 we
 do
 an
 annual


sustainability
 trends
 report.
 This
 is


the
 ninth
 year.
 We
 couldn't
 find
 any


place
 where
 it
 was
 all
 put
 together
 and


so
 we've
 tried
 to
 do
 it
 each
 year.
 A
 and


our
 our
 key
 findings
 uh
 this
 year
 are


that
 um
 there
 is
 some
 pause
 but
 there's


also
 reason
 for
 uh
 some
 good
 feelings.


You
 know
 10
 years
 ago
 the
 projections


were
 that
 we
 would
 um
 reach
 a
 3.6Â°
 C


increase
 in
 temperatures.
 That
 has
 now


been
 cut
 down
 to
 2.7.
 So
 we've
 shaved


off
 nearly
 1%
 but
 it's
 not
 nearly


enough.
 And
 since
 2001
 we
 have
 more
 or


less
 stalled
 out
 at
 that
 level.
 The


estimated
 temperature
 rise
 under
 current


national
 policies
 has
 not
 moved
 in
 four


years.
 And
 we
 all
 know
 the
 reasons.


There
 is
 a
 huge
 political
 push
 back
 that


has
 made
 it
 harder
 and
 harder
 for


countries
 to
 adopt
 new
 policies
 and


improve
 their
 climate
 uh
 ambition.


You
 know,
 uh,
 last
 week
 the
 Swedish


Nobel
 Committee
 award
 I
 by
 the
 way
 much


prefer
 the
 Norwegian
 Nobel
 Committee.


Uh,
 but
 the
 Swedish
 committee
 awarded


its
 economics
 prize
 this
 year
 to
 three


distinguished
 economists.
 Half
 to
 Joel


Moer
 and
 half
 to
 two
 of
 his
 colleagues.


And
 I
 think
 it's
 worth
 reflecting


because
 on
 what
 they
 are
 honored
 for


finding
 because
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 more


consequential
 awards
 uh
 in
 the
 last


several
 decades
 in
 my
 opinion.
 Mocher


who
 has
 had
 a
 narrative
 throughine
 for


decades
 makes
 the
 point
 that
 innovation


is
 the
 real
 key
 uh
 to
 economic
 uh


prosperity
 and
 growth.
 But
 his
 two


colleagues
 have
 pointed
 out
 that
 one
 of


the
 factors
 that
 stifles
 innovation
 is


when
 powerful
 incumbent
 industries
 that


have
 a
 reason
 to
 fear
 the
 changes
 that


come
 with
 innovation
 might
 have
 gathered


too
 much
 political
 power
 uh
 and
 as
 a


result
 are
 able
 to
 stop
 the
 introduction


of
 innovations.


And
 the
 fossil
 fuel
 industry
 is


significantly
 more
 efficient
 at


capturing
 politicians
 than
 capturing


emissions.
 Uh
 and
 as
 a
 result,
 they
 have


used
 the
 accumulated
 political
 power
 to


push
 back
 and
 to
 blunt
 the
 progress
 that


the
 world


needs
 very
 seriously.
 We
 are
 continuing


to
 put
 175
 million
 tons
 of
 man-made


global
 warming
 pollution
 into
 the


troposphere
 every
 day.
 And
 it


accumulates
 to
 the
 point
 where
 it


presently


traps
 as
 much
 extra
 heat
 each
 day
 as


would
 be
 released
 by
 750,000


first
 generation
 atomic
 bombs
 exploding


on
 the
 earth's
 surface
 every
 24
 hours.


Uh
 this
 is
 causing
 a
 massive
 disruption


of
 the
 water
 cycle.
 it
 is
 creating
 uh


massive
 consequences
 that
 are
 getting


worse
 by
 the
 day.
 And
 as
 we
 seek
 to


restart
 the
 progress
 that
 stalled
 out
 um


in
 2021,


we
 also
 confront
 a
 wave
 of
 right-wing


populism
 that
 has
 at
 best
 complicated


politics
 around
 the
 world.
 And
 we
 have


seen
 a
 tumultuous
 few
 years
 with
 the


sadistic
 invasion
 of
 Ukraine
 by
 Russia,


with
 the
 interruption
 of
 gas
 supplies,


as
 President
 Lagarde
 has
 eloquently


described,
 the
 pandemic,
 which
 we
 want


to
 forget
 quickly,
 but
 really
 royal


politics
 in
 quite
 a
 significant
 number


of
 ways.
 And
 lest
 we
 forget,
 we
 are


still
 coping
 with
 the
 hyper


globalization
 that
 followed
 China's


admission
 to
 the
 WTO
 with
 the


centrifugal
 redistribution
 of
 many


higher
 wage
 jobs
 to
 low-wage
 venues


around
 the
 world
 and
 an
 increase
 in


hyper
 inequality
 that
 has
 caused
 a
 lot


of
 dissatisfaction


that
 infects
 the
 politics
 of
 every


nation.


So
 that
 lack
 of
 progress
 is
 why
 this


year
 is
 so
 critical.
 And
 in
 less
 than
 a


month,
 the
 nations
 of
 the
 world
 will


meet
 in
 Brazil
 for
 COP
 30,
 the
 annual


UNled
 international
 climate


negotiations.
 And
 10
 years
 ago
 in
 Paris,


195
 countries
 agreed
 to
 get
 to
 net
 zero


by
 2050.
 Only
 one
 nation
 has
 withdrawn.


I'm
 embarrassed
 to
 remind
 you
 that
 it's


my
 nation.
 But
 I
 also
 want
 to
 note
 a


significant
 u
 mathematical
 equation
 that


some
 people
 seem
 to
 forget
 episodically.


195
 minus
 one
 does
 not
 equal
 zero.
 Other


nations
 are
 stepping
 up
 and
 filling
 the


gap.
 uh
 and
 the
 European
 European
 Union


is
 playing
 a
 leadership
 role
 and
 no


nation
 is
 providing
 as
 much
 leadership


truly
 as
 Norway
 is
 providing.
 Um
 and


unfortunately
 uh
 the
 election
 of


President
 Trump
 has
 complicated
 this


quite
 uh
 significantly


but
 of
 course
 and
 his
 actions
 are


influencing
 some
 other
 nations
 which


have
 slowed
 down
 their
 own
 progress.
 But


no
 other
 nation
 has
 withdrawn.
 We
 are


seeing
 new
 national
 plans
 come
 out.
 So


far
 they
 are
 much
 weaker
 than
 they
 need


to
 be.
 And
 the
 weakness
 of
 these
 plans


is
 worrisome
 but
 not
 entirely
 surprising


because
 if
 the
 largest
 emitter
 of
 global


warming
 pollution
 in
 history
 uh
 is
 not


participating
 in
 solving
 this
 collective


problem,
 then
 that
 can
 damage
 the


motivation
 of
 other
 countries
 uh
 to


tackle
 it
 themselves.
 But
 Norway
 is
 one


of
 the
 nations
 poised
 to
 usher
 in
 a


reversal
 of
 what
 I
 believe
 is
 destined


to
 be
 a
 short-lived
 trend
 of


backsliding.
 In
 submitting
 a
 new
 climate


plan
 ahead
 of
 COP
 30,
 Norway
 has


indicated
 that
 action
 is
 still
 on
 the


agenda.
 And
 of
 course,
 as
 always,
 the


devil
 is
 in
 the
 details.
 But
 I
 want
 to


applaud
 Norway's
 robust
 and
 ongoing


commitment
 to
 helping
 developing
 nations


adapt
 to
 the
 changes
 that
 can
 no
 longer


be
 avoided.
 In
 fact,
 Norway's
 track


record
 of
 overseas
 development


assistance
 uh
 and
 other
 aid
 is
 truly


remarkable.
 You've
 routinely
 committed


more
 than
 1%
 of
 your
 national
 income
 to


these
 purposes.
 No
 other
 country
 I'm


aware
 of
 can
 match
 that
 record.
 My
 own


country
 is
 closer
 to
 a
 quarter
 of
 a


percentage
 point.
 And
 that's
 before
 the


current
 administration
 started
 slashing


foreign
 aid.
 And
 Norway
 has
 committed
 to


doubling
 its
 climate
 finance
 by
 2026


compared
 with
 the
 2020
 figure
 and
 has


already
 achieved
 this
 goal
 for
 the
 past


two
 years.
 Norway
 has
 also
 played
 a


stalwart
 role
 in
 saving
 helping
 to
 save


the
 world's
 tropical
 forests


contributing
 the
 equivalent
 of
 many


billions
 of
 US
 dollars
 to
 that
 cause.
 It


is
 important
 to
 recognize,
 however,
 that


government-to-government
 aid,
 as


essential
 as
 it
 is,
 uh,
 pales
 in


comparison
 to
 the
 needed
 access
 to


private
 capital
 in
 order
 to
 finance
 the


energy
 transition.


One
 of
 the
 most
 hopeful
 and
 optimistic


trends
 of
 the
 last
 few
 years,
 last
 year


for
 example,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 all
 of
 the


new
 electricity
 generation
 installed


worldwide
 everywhere
 in
 the
 world,
 many


are
 surprised
 to
 hear
 that
 the


percentage
 represented
 by
 renewable


energy
 was
 93%.


And
 the
 International
 Energy
 Agency
 has


projected
 that
 in
 the
 years
 ahead,
 it's


going
 to
 exceed
 95%


renewable
 energy.


But
 where
 did
 the
 money
 come
 from
 to


install
 that
 93%
 renewable
 energy?
 85%


of
 the
 money
 came
 from
 private
 capital,


only
 15%
 from
 government
 to
 support.


However,
 there
 is
 an
 unequal


malistribution


of
 access
 to
 capital.
 There
 is
 what
 the


economists
 call
 a
 home
 bias.
 And
 there


is
 also
 a
 reluctance
 on
 the
 part
 of


investors
 and
 lenders
 to
 commit
 to


capital
 in
 uh
 infusions
 into
 developing


countries
 where
 there
 is
 a
 noticeable


risk
 of
 currency
 valuation
 on
 a
 sudden


basis
 which
 might
 cause
 them
 to
 lose


their
 money.
 Of
 course,
 they're
 going
 to


be
 concerned.
 uh
 access
 to
 courts
 for


the
 enforcement
 of
 contracts,
 continuity


of
 government,
 continuity
 of
 government,


uh
 corruption
 in
 some
 areas.
 All
 of


these
 factors
 have
 raised
 the
 interest


rates
 for
 developing
 countries
 two
 to


three
 times
 higher
 than
 what
 Norway
 or


the
 United
 States
 would
 pay.
 Uh
 and
 as
 a


result,
 they
 have
 been
 deprived
 of


access
 to
 capital.
 Take
 Africa
 for


example.
 Africa
 has
 60%
 of
 the
 prime


solar
 energy
 potential
 of
 the
 entire


world.
 But
 Africa
 has
 fewer
 solar
 panels


installed
 than
 the
 single
 US
 state
 of


Florida.
 That
 is
 a
 disgraceful


commentary
 on
 the
 current
 system
 for
 the


allocation
 of
 capital
 around
 the
 world.


Developing
 countries
 as
 a
 whole
 are


getting
 a
 tiny
 share
 of
 the
 capital


necessary
 to
 finance
 the
 energy


transition
 and
 the
 larger
 sustainability


transition.
 They
 are
 getting
 43%
 of
 the


new
 investment
 in
 fossil
 fuel


development,
 virtually
 all
 of
 it
 for


exporting
 fossil
 fuel
 resources
 from


developing
 countries
 to
 the
 wealthy


countries.
 My
 friends
 in
 the
 activist


community
 in
 developing
 countries
 call


it
 fossil
 fuel
 colonialism.


And
 of
 course,
 the
 resource
 curse
 that


countries
 like
 Nigeria
 have
 experienced


is
 to
 be
 avoided,
 especially
 now
 that
 we


have
 a
 superior
 source
 of
 energy
 in


renewable
 energy,
 both
 solar
 uh
 and


wind.
 and
 the
 cost
 of
 solar
 and
 wind
 uh


continue
 to
 go
 down
 uh
 very
 very
 uh


impressively.


Now
 this
 nation
 has
 been
 as
 I've
 said
 a


very
 impressive
 leader
 in
 all
 of
 these


matters
 and
 Norway's
 power
 sector
 is


already
 one
 of
 the
 cleanest
 in
 the


world.
 98%


of
 Norway's
 electricity
 capacity
 is


carbonf
 free
 and
 of
 course
 you
 have
 a


lot
 of
 hydro
 power
 but
 you've
 made
 the


right
 choices
 and
 and
 we
 are
 seeing
 an


inflection
 point
 as
 the
 cost
 of
 solar
 in


particular
 reaches
 unprecedented
 low


levels.
 Take
 Pakistan
 for
 example.
 They


are
 installing
 cheap
 Chinese
 solar


panels
 at
 a
 record
 rate.
 In
 some
 areas


of
 Pakistan,
 it
 is
 now
 not
 uncommon
 for


a
 bride's
 dowy
 to
 be
 three
 panels
 and
 an


inverter.
 Uh
 and
 that's
 a
 true
 story.


And
 we
 are
 seeing
 this
 take
 off
 in
 so


many
 uh
 countries.
 Uh
 imports
 of
 solar


panels
 are
 rising
 very
 quickly
 not
 only


in
 the
 developing
 countries
 of
 Africa
 uh


but
 in
 Southeast
 Asia
 and
 elsewhere
 in


the
 world.
 And
 when
 solar
 panels
 are


coupled
 with
 batteries,
 then
 the


transformation
 really
 begins
 to
 take


hold.
 In
 my
 nation,
 the
 California
 grid


is
 getting
 20%
 of
 its
 power
 in
 the
 early


evening
 from
 batteries
 charged
 with


sunshine
 earlier
 in
 the
 day.
 I
 flew
 here


from
 Australia
 and
 South
 Australia
 gets


30%
 of
 its
 power
 from
 batteries
 in
 the


early
 evening.
 Their
 goal
 is
 to
 reach


100%.
 And
 the
 experts
 believe
 they


definitely
 will
 reach
 that
 goal.
 So
 the


second
 largest
 market
 for
 fossil
 fuels


after
 electricity
 generation
 is


transportation.


Uh
 and
 worldwide
 the
 sales
 volume
 of


electric
 cars
 is
 up
 more
 than
 30%
 this


year.
 Uh
 will
 likely
 be
 a
 quarter
 of
 all


cars
 sold
 worldwide
 uh
 in
 2025.


And
 Norway
 once
 again
 is
 the
 global


leader.
 Cars
 with
 plugs
 have
 been
 nor


more
 than
 90%
 of
 the
 market
 for
 years


already.
 And
 the
 figures
 for
 the
 month


of
 September
 just
 came
 in.
 98.3%


of
 all
 new
 car
 sales
 in
 Norway
 are


electric.
 So
 I
 think
 you
 can
 check
 that


box.
 Norway,
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 for


your
 leadership.
 Your
 national
 fleet
 is


already
 one-third
 electric
 on
 its
 way


toward
 100%.


And
 the
 rest
 of
 us
 can
 look
 around


Norway
 right
 now
 and
 begin
 to
 see
 the


start
 of
 a
 post
 oil
 future.
 But
 there
 is


a
 huge
 geopolitical
 challenge
 associated


with
 both
 the
 solar
 boom,
 the
 battery


boom
 uh
 and
 the
 electric
 transportation


boom.
 China
 has
 made
 decisions
 that
 have


allowed
 it
 to
 dominate
 the
 market
 in
 all


of
 these
 sustainability
 focused


industries
 uh
 in
 the
 future.
 During
 the


month
 of
 May
 this
 year,
 China
 installed


as
 much
 new
 solar
 electric
 capacity


every
 day
 as
 would
 have
 been
 provided
 by


opening
 three
 1
 gawatt
 nuclear
 plants


every
 day,
 30
 days
 in
 a
 row.
 It's


difficult
 to
 imagine
 any
 other
 country


accomplishing
 that
 and
 in
 every
 one
 of


the
 related
 fields
 they
 have
 made
 an
 in


a
 decision
 to
 move
 aggressively
 to


dominate
 those
 industries.
 So
 we
 must


respond
 to
 that
 challenge.
 China
 seems


to
 think
 that
 they
 really
 will
 make
 the


21st
 century
 a
 Chinese
 century
 and


provide
 leadership
 for
 the
 entire
 world


perhaps
 in
 the
 geopolitical
 sphere
 as


well.
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 can.
 I
 don't


think
 the
 world
 will
 follow
 China


because
 the
 world
 does
 not
 generally


speaking
 agree
 with
 the
 values
 of
 China.


We
 value
 freedom
 even
 though
 it
 seems
 at


times
 to
 be
 under
 assault.
 But
 uh
 let
 me


also
 made
 make
 the
 point
 that
 suspicion


of
 Chinese
 motives
 might
 well
 be


warranted
 on
 many
 fronts
 including
 the


security
 risks
 that
 they
 pose
 to
 NATO


countries
 and
 European
 countries
 more


generally.
 The
 Chinese
 economy
 is
 itself


a
 long
 way
 from
 clean.
 But
 we
 have
 to


recognize
 that
 what
 they
 have


accomplished
 with
 the
 energy
 transition.


Uh
 Norway
 uh
 is
 inspiring
 countries


around
 the
 world.
 Uh
 we
 have
 to
 respond


and
 ma
 to
 and
 manage
 China's
 dominance


of
 these
 technologies.
 And
 yet
 we
 also


need
 to
 recognize
 that
 since
 Paris,
 the


direction
 of
 travel
 for
 the
 world


economy
 has
 been
 clear.
 Companies
 that


want
 to
 continue
 to
 compete
 for
 global


markets
 will
 have
 to
 make
 sustainability


central
 to
 their
 business
 operations.


The
 United
 States
 uh
 is
 not


participating
 in
 the
 way
 that
 it
 should.


But
 I
 do
 believe
 that
 change
 is
 coming


in
 my
 country
 uh
 as
 well.
 So
 despite
 the


political
 difficulties
 of
 the
 moment,
 we


cannot
 let
 the
 ambition
 for
 a
 better


world
 wither
 away
 on
 our
 watch.
 So,
 let


me
 close
 by
 citing
 Norway's
 celebrated


playwright
 Henrik
 Hibson.
 And
 I
 am
 not


going
 to
 be
 brave
 enough


as
 as
 Christine
 was
 to
 even
 attempt
 to


say
 it
 in
 Norwegian.
 Oh
 jeez,
 Christine.


At
 a
 time
 when
 we've
 seen
 institutions


of
 all
 kinds,
 but
 particularly
 financial


institutions,
 back
 away
 from
 their


earlier
 climate
 commitments,
 I'm


reminded
 of
 Ipsson's
 The
 Master
 Builder


and
 the
 quote,
 "Castles
 in
 the
 air.
 They


are
 so
 easy
 to
 take
 refuge
 in
 and
 so


easy
 to
 build,
 too."
 But
 I'd
 like
 to


remind
 us
 of
 another
 passage
 which
 to
 me


demonstrates
 our
 collective
 task.
 from


Manden.
 He
 wrote,
 "A
 thousand
 words


can't
 make
 the
 mark.
 A
 single
 deed
 will


leave."
 So,
 the
 time
 has
 come
 for
 all
 of


us
 to
 summon
 our
 strength
 and
 ignore
 our


critics,
 uh,
 turn
 our
 words
 into
 deeds


that
 will
 collectively
 safeguard
 the


future
 of
 human
 civilization.
 We
 have


everything
 we
 need.
 The
 International


Energy
 Agency
 tells
 us
 the
 technologies


are
 there
 for
 65%
 of
 the
 way
 to
 reducing


to
 net
 zero.
 Proven
 business
 models
 are


already
 known.
 We
 have
 clear
 line
 of


sight
 to
 the
 other
 35%.


Every
 morallybased
 challenge
 that


humanity
 has
 faced
 has
 gone
 through


periods
 when
 the
 advocates
 felt
 despair.


the
 abolition
 of
 slavery,
 women's


suffrage,
 ending
 apartheid
 in
 South


Africa.
 It
 seemed
 at
 times
 impossible,


as
 the
 late
 man
 Nelson
 Mandela
 once


said,
 it
 always
 seems
 impossible
 until


it's
 done.
 And
 when
 the
 underbrush
 of


argumentation
 is
 cleared
 away
 and
 the


central
 issue
 is
 revealed
 to
 be
 a
 choice


between
 right
 and
 wrong,
 then
 at
 a
 very


deep
 level,
 the
 outcome
 becomes


forordained.


The
 only
 thing
 some
 people
 think
 we
 have


in
 short
 supply
 is
 political
 will.
 But


please
 always
 remember
 that
 political


will
 is
 itself
 a
 renewable
 resource.


Thank
 you.
