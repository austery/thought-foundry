All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 We
 are
 live.


Uh,
 we
 got
 some
 earnings.
 So,
 PayPal.


I
 think
 Noto's
 on
 CNBC
 right
 now.
 Is
 he?


No,
 he's
 not.


Well,
 we
 will.
 No,
 he
 was.
 Okay,
 I'm


going
 to
 go.
 We're
 going
 to
 get
 the


results
 in
 a
 second,
 but
 I'm
 going
 to
 go


right
 here
 on
 CNBC.
 Listen
 to


>> seen
 the
 results.


>> No,
 I've
 seen
 the
 results.
 They
 beat
 on


top
 and
 bottom
 EPS
 two
 cents
 EPS
 revenue


like
 20
 million.
 But
 here's
 not
 and
 then


we'll
 get
 into
 everything
 else.


>> Good
 morning
 to
 you.
 Congratulations
 on


uh
 some
 nice
 earnings
 there.
 Uh
 we're


looking
 at
 the
 stock
 this
 morning.
 Uh


help
 us
 understand
 what's
 driving
 this


and
 then
 we
 can
 try
 to
 maybe
 look
 out


into
 the
 future
 to
 understand
 a
 little


bit
 better
 what
 2026
 may
 portend.


>> Sure.
 Well,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me
 on
 this


morning.
 Uh
 we
 had
 an
 exceptional


quarter
 in
 every
 way.
 What's
 driving
 our


growth
 is
 our
 unique
 strategy.
 We're
 the


only
 place
 that
 on
 the
 digital
 platform,


you
 can
 get
 all
 your
 financial
 needs


served
 across
 big
 decisions
 that
 you'll


make
 like
 buying
 a
 home
 or
 paying
 for


college,
 day-to-day
 activity
 like
 a
 SoFi


money
 account
 or
 investing
 for
 your


future
 um
 or
 needing
 a
 charge
 card
 to


pay
 at
 the
 point
 of
 sale.
 Uh
 that


diversification
 has
 driven
 really
 strong


member
 and
 product
 growth.
 Our
 members


grew
 35%
 year-over-year,
 products
 grew


36%
 year-over-year,
 and
 that
 manifests


itself
 in
 revenue
 growth
 of
 38%.
 Um


we've
 been
 public
 for
 17
 quarters
 and


every
 quarter
 of
 those
 last
 17
 we've


achieved
 um
 the
 rule
 of
 40
 or
 more
 we've


averaged
 about
 58%
 and
 that's
 taking


your
 revenue
 growth
 and
 your
 ebidom


market


>> and
 this
 quarter
 was
 67.
 So
 it's
 a


combination
 of
 durable
 growth
 innovation


and
 brand
 building.
 So
 Anthony,
 what
 is


the
 product
 right
 now
 when
 you
 look
 at


sort
 of
 the
 the
 the
 multiple
 different


products
 that
 you
 offer
 in
 terms
 of
 the


tip
 of
 the
 spear
 that's
 bringing
 new


customers
 into
 your
 ecosystem
 which
 then


you're
 effectively
 selling,
 you
 know,


and
 upselling
 them
 other
 products?
 What


is
 it
 that's
 happening
 here?


>> Sure.
 So
 money
 is
 by
 far
 um
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 are
 the
 tip
 of
 the
 spear.
 We


have
 6
 million
 members.
 It's
 a
 very


unique
 offering.
 It's
 the
 best
 of


checking
 and
 savings
 in
 one.
 We
 give


high
 interest
 about
 a
 3.8
 8%
 APY
 today.


We
 charge
 no
 fees.
 We
 provide
 reward


points.
 You
 can
 pay
 anybody
 anywhere


that
 you
 would
 like.
 You
 can
 pay
 via
 an


email
 address,
 via
 a
 phone
 number,
 via


your
 debit
 card,
 via
 a
 you
 can
 now
 do


instant
 wires
 as
 well.
 So,
 we
 tried
 to


deliver
 the
 best
 place
 to
 save,
 the
 best


place
 to
 spend,
 uh
 to
 do
 it
 safely,


quickly,
 and
 cheaply.
 Um,
 in
 addition
 to


that,
 you
 also
 become
 a
 uh
 member
 and


you
 get
 free
 certified
 financial


planning
 because
 we're
 trying
 to
 help


you
 spend
 less
 than
 you
 make
 and
 invest


the
 rest.
 Half
 of
 the
 Americans
 in
 the


United
 States
 don't
 invest
 today
 and


it's
 primarily
 because
 they
 have
 no


discretionary
 income
 to
 achieve
 their


goals.
 So,
 that
 is
 at
 the
 tip
 of
 the


sword.
 Another
 product,
 Relay.
 Um,
 both


products
 are
 over
 6
 million
 products,


both
 Relay
 and
 SoFi
 money.
 Those
 are
 the


tip
 of
 the
 sword.
 And
 then
 we
 drive


about
 40%
 crossby.
 It
 was
 a
 record
 this


quarter
 because
 we
 have
 this
 breath
 of


products.
 We're
 using
 information
 that


we
 have
 about
 you
 to
 help
 you
 borrow


better,
 save
 better,
 spend
 better,
 and


invest
 better.
 And
 so
 that
 is
 helping


>> who
 are
 you
 taking
 share
 from?
 If
 you
 if


you
 if
 if
 you
 were
 sitting
 around
 on
 a


Monday
 morning
 with
 a
 with
 a
 whiteboard


looking
 at
 sort
 of
 who
 you
 actually


think
 of
 as
 your
 competitor
 set
 today,


who
 is
 it?
 Because
 obviously
 there's
 the


banks,
 there's
 a
 number
 of
 the
 digital


platforms.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 just
 curious
 what


you
 would
 I
 won't
 answer.
 What
 do
 you


think?


>> Yeah.
 Uh,
 it's
 not
 what
 I
 think,
 it's


what
 I
 know.
 We
 can
 actually
 see
 where


the
 money
 is
 coming
 from
 directly
 every


day,
 and
 it's
 really
 coming
 from
 the


banks.
 Uh,
 there's
 in
 the
 United
 States,


there's
 over
 5,000
 banks.
 Uh,
 the
 large


banks
 have
 trillions
 of
 dollars
 of


deposits.
 Uh,
 we're
 at
 about
 $33
 billion


of
 deposits
 today.
 We
 added
 a
 record
 of


$3
 billion
 of
 deposits.
 And
 those


deposits
 are
 coming
 from
 the
 big
 banks,


the
 largest
 banks
 in
 our
 country.
 Um,


and
 that's
 on
 the
 SoFi
 money
 product,


which
 as
 I
 mentioned
 is
 the
 tip
 of
 the


sword.
 In
 invest,
 we're
 really
 actually


creating
 new
 investors
 as
 well
 as
 novice


investors
 and
 helping
 them
 get
 up
 the


learning
 curve.
 Um,
 within
 student
 loan


refinancing,
 we
 really
 don't
 compete


against
 anyone
 because
 it's
 a
 product


that's
 not
 really
 offered
 by
 big


financial
 institutions.
 I
 would
 say
 in


mortgage,
 the
 big
 banks
 do
 not
 offer


mortgage
 to
 everyday
 Main
 Street


customers.
 Um,
 and
 so
 in
 each
 product


category,
 the
 competitor
 is
 different,


but
 overall,
 it's
 the
 big
 banks.


>> Okay.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 saw
 the
 news


this
 morning
 and
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 how


early
 you've
 been
 up
 because
 I
 imagine


you're
 on
 the
 West
 Coast,
 but
 uh
 PayPal


and
 OpenAI
 just
 announced
 a
 partnership


where
 you're
 going
 to
 actually
 be
 able


to
 uh
 effectively
 pay
 for
 things
 using


PayPal
 inside
 of
 Chat
 GPT
 going
 forward.


And
 to
 me,
 this
 has
 huge
 implications


for
 the
 entire
 sort
 of
 financial


community
 because
 there's
 a
 question


both
 of
 the
 opportunity
 set
 uh
 to


effectively
 partner
 with
 some
 of
 these


large
 language
 models
 and
 and
 chat
 bots,


but
 there's
 also
 the
 possibility
 of


remarkable
 amounts
 of
 disruption
 that


could
 ultimately
 take
 place.
 How
 are
 you


thinking
 about
 that?


>> Sure.
 There
 are
 two
 technology
 super


cycles
 happening
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 Both


of
 which
 that
 impact
 the
 fintech
 sector


and
 SoFi
 specifically.
 One
 is
 AI
 and
 the


other
 is
 blockchain.
 Uh
 we
 launched
 this


quarter
 SoFi
 pay
 and
 you
 can
 now
 send


dollars
 from
 the
 United
 States
 through
 a


level
 two
 blockchain
 via
 SoFi
 to
 someone


in
 Mexico
 and
 have
 it
 convert
 into
 the


local
 fiat
 there
 in
 pesos.
 We'll
 roll


that
 out
 throughout
 the
 entire
 world
 and


then
 we'll
 take
 the
 SoFi
 pay
 app
 which


will
 allow
 you
 to
 pay
 not
 just
 via


blockchain
 and
 stable
 coin
 uh
 which
 SoFi


will
 issue
 but
 allow
 you
 to
 pay
 any


other
 way
 that
 you
 would
 like
 to.
 So


it's
 a
 universal
 payment
 capability.
 So,


we're
 going
 to
 put
 the
 SoFi
 app
 in
 these


foreign
 countries
 to
 allow
 international


um
 payments
 to
 be
 made.
 What
 I'd
 say


about
 these
 press
 releases
 with
 Chat
 GPT


and
 others
 is
 we're
 launching
 products.


We're
 not
 putting
 out
 press
 releases.


There
 was
 one
 yesterday
 about
 a
 stable


coin
 with
 a
 big
 bank.
 Let's
 watch
 what


people
 actually
 launch
 and
 the
 impact


that
 they're
 having.
 The
 reaction
 that


we
 got
 from
 US
 uh
 consumers
 and
 our


members
 from
 launching
 international


remittance
 cheaper,
 faster,
 and
 safer


than
 the
 current
 mechanisms
 uh
 was


really
 positive.
 And
 so
 you'll
 continue


to
 see
 us
 innovate
 behind
 both
 AI
 and


blockchain.
 Um,
 one
 thing
 that
 uh
 we


didn't
 talk
 about
 is
 that
 we
 will
 be
 the


first
 national
 bank
 in
 the
 United
 States


to
 launch
 buy,
 sell,
 and
 hold
 crypto
 on


our
 platform.
 First
 national
 bank
 to


offer
 that
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 We'll


launch
 a
 stable
 coin
 in
 Q1
 which
 will


help
 us
 really
 drive
 faster,
 cheaper,


and
 safer
 uh
 payments
 as
 well.


>> Anthony
 Notto
 taking
 the
 gloves
 off


early
 at
 PayPal
 and
 OpenAI.
 We


appreciate
 it.
 Uh
 it's
 great
 to
 see
 you


and
 look
 forward
 to
 hopefully
 seeing
 you


in
 person
 soon.


>> All
 right.
 Um
 these
 are
 the
 results
 on


the
 top
 line
 for
 those
 that
 haven't
 seen


it.
 You
 got
 a
 22%
 EPS
 beat,
 6%
 revenue


beat,
 950,000
 members,
 700
 uh
 or
 sorry,


76%


uh
 financial
 services
 growth.
 And
 I
 mean


it's
 is
 a
 pretty
 damn
 good
 quarter.


Steve,
 what
 are
 your
 your
 thoughts
 as


you're
 seeing
 this?
 They
 crushed
 it.
 I


mean,
 Triple
 Beat,
 just
 like
 I
 said,


they
 absolutely
 crushed
 it.
 I
 mean,


there's
 not
 a
 bad
 And
 look,
 I
 didn't


read
 through
 the
 entire
 deck.


On
 the
 surface,
 there
 is
 nothing
 to
 be


mad
 at.


I'm
 sure
 I'll
 nitpick
 and
 find


something,
 but


you
 can't
 be
 mad
 at
 these
 numbers.
 And


they
 grew
 what?
 95,000


new
 members.
 They're
 very
 close
 to


getting
 a
 million
 a
 quarter.


>> 950.
 They're


>> Was
 it
 950?
 Did
 I
 read
 it
 wrong?


>> It
 is.


I
 thought


>> Oh,
 sorry.
 You're
 right.
 95,000.
 My
 bad.


My
 bad.
 Yeah.


>> I'm
 also
 not
 awake.
 So,


>> dude,
 I
 am
 tired.
 This
 is
 the
 I
 have


like
 I'm
 usually
 not
 this
 tired.
 I'm


freaking
 tired.


>> This
 is
 not
 okay.
 Like
 I'm
 gonna
 put
 a


tweet
 out
 to
 no
 that
 like
 this
 is
 not


okay.


>> I
 don't
 know
 why
 they
 do
 it
 in
 the


morning
 like
 this.
 Um


wait
 95,000
 actually.
 I
 I
 thought
 it
 was


950.
 That
 actually
 changes
 stuff
 because


that
 was
 closer
 to
 a
 million.
 This
 is


less
 closer
 to
 a
 million.
 It's
 still
 a


great
 number.
 I
 did
 think
 they
 were


closing
 in
 on
 a
 million
 though.
 But


>> did
 you
 have
 breakfast
 yet?


>> I
 don't
 eat
 breakfast
 ever.
 You
 don't


eat
 breakfast.
 You
 didn't
 drink
 coffee.


How
 are
 you
 doing
 this?


>> You
 know,
 your
 guess
 is
 as
 good
 as
 mine.


>> How
 the
 hell
 are
 you
 functioning?


>> Your
 guess
 is
 as
 good
 as
 mine.


>> Well,
 okay.
 So,
 we'll
 go
 deeper
 into


SoFi,
 but
 um
 dude,
 PayPal
 said
 the
 magic


word.


>> Do
 you
 know
 what
 the
 magic
 word
 is,


Steve?


>> Hire.


Open
 AI


>> for
 PayPal.
 Why
 is
 PayPal
 up
 this


morning,


>> dude?
 They're
 up
 15%.
 You
 didn't
 see
 it?


>> No.


>> PayPal
 is
 up
 15%.


And
 the
 reason
 they're
 up
 is
 because


Yeah,
 it
 was
 a
 good
 EPS
 and
 revenue


beep.
 But


>> Andrew
 Chris
 or
 whatever
 his
 name
 is
 was


like,
 "Nothing
 else
 is
 going
 to
 get
 this


stock
 to
 go
 up.
 Let's
 just
 freaking


mention
 Open
 AI
 and
 become
 an
 AI
 company


and
 you
 were
 going
 to
 go
 up."


>> Yeah.
 Okay.
 Legend
 isn't
 working.
 It's


being
 stupid.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 share


Weeble.
 But,
 um,
 did
 did
 they
 give
 a


dividend,
 guys?
 I
 heard
 that
 they
 gave
 a


dividend.


Um,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 confirm
 that
 unless


that
 is
 true.
 PayPal.
 Look
 at
 that.


14.59%.


Yeah,
 they've
 announced
 a
 dividend.


Okay,
 cool.
 I
 mean,


>> oh,
 they're
 listening.
 Look
 at
 that.


>> You've
 been
 asking
 for
 this
 for
 a
 while,


right?


>> Been
 asking
 for
 it.
 They
 just
 became
 a


prime
 candidate
 to
 be
 in
 every
 single


dividend
 ETF.


Company
 initiates
 a
 quarterly
 dividend


of
 14
 cents
 a
 share.


I
 mean,
 dude,
 that's


it's
 a
 big
 deal.


It's
 a
 big
 deal
 in
 my
 opinion.


Like,


>> yeah.
 Now,
 I
 can't
 complain
 about


anything.


You've
 been
 saying
 they
 need
 a
 dividend


for
 a
 long
 time.


>> Yep.


>> They're
 buying
 back
 stock
 and
 they're


doing
 divvies.


>> Yep.


>> And


and
 then
 they
 announced
 an
 opening
 eye


partnership.
 They're
 going to
 be
 like
 an


integrated
 payments
 partner
 inside
 of


SHABT.
 I
 mean,
 you
 put
 all
 three
 of


those
 together.
 Revenues
 beat
 by
 7%
 or


revenues
 up
 7%
 year-over-year.
 Um
 they


beat
 by
 12%
 on
 EPS,
 beat
 by
 2%
 on


revenue.


I
 mean,
 we
 all
 knew
 the
 stock
 was


undervalued,
 so
 it
 just
 needed
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 bolt.
 And
 the
 dividend
 and
 open


eye
 partnership
 was
 enough,
 it
 seems,
 to


make
 a
 move.


So,
 where
 does
 SoFi
 go
 from
 here
 is
 the


question.
 Is
 this
 good
 enough


to


not
 dump
 at
 2:00
 today?
 By
 the
 way,
 UNH


is
 up
 3%.


We'll
 look
 at
 their
 earnings
 as
 well
 in


a
 second,
 but
 UNH
 is
 up.
 Yeah,
 I
 don't


know.
 I
 mean,
 the
 the
 the
 stock
 reaction


is
 pretty
 muted.
 Um,


I
 mean,
 muted
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 it
 was
 at


this
 level
 last
 night,
 so
 no
 one


>> Oh,
 by
 the
 way,
 before
 we
 really
 get


into
 this,
 hold
 on.
 Show
 Otani
 steals


the
 show
 in
 record-breaking
 18
 World


Series
 Classic.
 I
 couldn't
 stay
 up
 at


like
 12:15.


I
 was
 like,
 I
 I
 have
 to
 be
 up
 for
 SoFi


because
 Noto
 is
 crazy.


That
 this
 guy's
 the
 best
 player
 that


ever
 lived.
 That's
 all
 I'm
 gonna
 say.


>> The
 Dodgers
 won,
 right?


>> Best
 player
 that's
 ever
 lived.


>> So,
 it's
 2-1
 now.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 so.


All
 right.
 So,
 find
 better
 relations.
 I


want
 to
 go
 through
 the
 deck.
 Have
 you


gone
 through
 the
 deck
 yet?


>> A
 little
 bit.
 Not
 most
 of
 it.


>> I
 haven't
 seen
 it.


Yeah,
 guys.
 Sorry
 if
 our
 uh
 if
 our


energy
 is
 not
 super
 super
 up
 there,


which
 is
 this
 early


>> freaking
 hat
 on.
 That's
 all
 I
 can
 say.


>> This
 is
 early,
 bro.
 Like
 you
 that
 extra


hour
 from
 now
 until
 when
 I
 go
 live
 at


8:45
 is
 really
 important.
 It
 like
 helps


you
 get
 the
 energy.
 This
 one
 is
 freaking


>> I'm
 just
 walking
 out
 the
 door
 now
 on
 my


way
 to
 Starbucks
 getting
 coffee.


And
 it's
 cold
 as
 hell,
 too.
 So,


>> dude,
 I
 went
 outside
 in
 shorts.
 I'm


like,
 what
 the
 freak?
 Like,


I
 was
 half
 asleep


wearing
 shorts.
 I'm
 like,
 it's
 not
 warm


out.


>> No,
 it's
 not.
 Things
 That's
 what
 I'm


saying.
 Everything
 things
 change
 so


quick
 on
 the
 Northeast.
 And


>> thankfully,
 I
 uh


it
 was
 a
 very
 short
 walk.


>> Okay.
 So,
 uh,
 SoFi,
 you
 said
 where
 does


it
 go?
 So,
 who
 thinks
 based
 on
 these


earnings
 SoFi
 dumps
 by
 end
 of
 day


because
 it's
 not
 making
 that
 big
 move.


Maybe
 it's
 waiting
 for
 the
 market
 to


open,
 but


>> Oh,
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 took
 the
 day
 off
 today


just
 so
 I
 could
 stream
 what
 it
 meant.


>> Oh,
 you
 actually
 took
 the
 day
 off.


>> I
 actually
 took
 the
 day
 off.
 I
 ha
 even


though
 I
 took
 the
 day
 off,
 I
 have
 to


attend
 two
 meetings
 and
 I'm
 still


technically
 working
 because
 I
 have
 stuff


I
 have
 to
 do
 throughout
 the
 day,
 but
 I


am
 using
 a
 vacation
 day
 for
 the
 first


time
 in
 God
 knows
 how
 long.


>> That's
 good.
 You
 should
 be.
 You
 never


take
 a
 vacation
 day.
 So,


>> never
 take
 vacation
 days.


All right.
 Added
 a
 record
 900,000
 new


members,
 100
 1.4
 4
 million
 new
 products.


Record
 adjusted
 Evida
 29%


adjusted
 margin.
 I
 hate
 adjusted


numbers.
 I
 hate
 them,
 but


whatever.
 I
 mean,
 I
 mean,
 how
 do
 you


feel
 about
 38%
 year-over-year
 growth
 in


adjusted
 net
 revenue?


I
 mean,
 look,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


they're
 growing
 like
 a
 tech
 company,
 so


you
 can't
 be
 upset
 about
 it,
 right?


They're
 growing.


I
 mean,
 I
 Here's
 one
 of
 the
 big
 things


for
 me.


>> Record
 loan
 originations
 of
 $9.9
 billion


in
 the
 quarter.
 I
 need
 to
 look
 more
 into


that
 when
 I
 get
 through
 the
 deck,
 but
 I


mean
 that's
 huge.


>> 9.9
 billion.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,


>> as
 rates
 come
 down,


>> this
 is
 just
 going
 to
 go
 up.


>> Agreed.
 Which
 is
 my
 thesis
 on
 SoFi
 for


this
 year
 as
 well.


and
 deposits
 keep
 scaling.
 3.4
 of
 new


quarterly
 deposits.
 We're
 at
 33
 billion.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 you
 can't
 be
 upset


at
 any
 of
 these
 numbers.
 Um,
 I
 guess
 the


member
 growth
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 light,


but
 still
 was
 pretty
 good,
 just
 against


some
 of the
 expectations.


Um,


credit
 card
 scaling.
 Invest
 is
 finally


having
 options.
 Crypto's
 coming
 back.


Members
 again,
 12.6
 million.
 I've
 always


had
 a
 gripe
 that
 I
 would
 like
 to
 know


how
 many
 members
 are
 active,
 but
 then


again,
 you
 know,
 who
 cares,


>> right?


>> I
 do
 think
 it
 would
 be
 important
 though


to
 know
 some
 of
 that.
 Uh,
 95,000
 new


members.
 Again,
 if
 I
 mean,
 eventually


they're
 going
 to
 get
 to
 a
 couple
 million


per
 quarter,
 even
 if
 it
 takes
 one
 or
 two


years.
 And
 so,


I
 don't
 know
 why
 the
 stock
 is
 not
 more


excited
 about
 this.
 I
 guess
 they
 didn't


say
 OpenAI,


>> right?
 They
 just
 didn't
 say
 Open
 AI.


>> Regardless,
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 good
 quarter.


I
 don't
 have
 UNH's
 numbers
 for
 some


reason.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 pull
 up
 UNH.


UNH.


>> Oh
 my
 god.
 No.
 No.
 Now
 go
 to
 slide
 11.


Please
 go
 to
 slide
 11.


>> Are
 you
 freaking
 kidding
 me?


Now,
 now
 we
 got
 to
 start
 talking
 about


rule
 of
 40
 with
 SoFi.
 Like,
 come
 on.


>> Why
 are
 they
 copying
 Palunteer,
 bro?


Pal
 got
 every
 single
 tech
 company
 to
 be


like,
 "Hey,
 we
 need
 to
 focus
 on
 rule
 of


40,
 though."


>> And
 is
 this
 even
 like
 a
 wow?
 I
 don't


even
 know.
 Is
 this
 a
 wow
 factor
 with


rule
 of
 40?


Uh
 well
 look
 so
 if
 if
 SoFi
 is
 proving


itself
 to
 be
 a
 company
 with
 really
 good


margins
 and
 really
 good
 growth
 then
 yeah


I
 mean
 look
 they
 have a
 rule
 of
 67
 right


is
 that
 yeah


>> it's
 not
 horrible.
 What
 was
 Palunteers


>> 81?


>> Not
 that


>> at
 104.


But


>> where's
 Okay.
 Tech
 platform
 growth.


Where
 is
 Can
 we
 get
 What's
 the
 number?


>> It's
 in
 the
 appendex.


>> Oh,
 they
 don't
 have
 a
 slide
 on
 the
 tech


platform.


>> No,
 I
 doubt
 it.
 Oh,


>> they
 do.
 They
 do.
 Right
 here.
 Um
 net


revenue
 115
 million
 12%
 growth


and
 32
 per
 32
 million
 of
 contribution


margin.


>> Oo
 home
 loans
 is
 up.
 Look
 at
 that.


Home
 loans
 is
 already
 more
 than
 2024
 and


through
 three
 quarters.


>> They
 said
 we
 executed
 4.6
 six
 billion
 of


personal
 student
 home
 loan
 sales


inclusive
 of
 the
 loan
 platform
 in
 Q3
 as


well.


I
 mean,
 there's
 not
 much
 to
 complain


about.
 You
 can
 say
 tech
 platform
 is
 not


growing
 as
 much,
 but
 everyone
 already


knew
 that.
 So,
 it's
 not
 like,


>> right,


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 hard
 to
 be
 mad
 at
 this.
 I


I'm
 I'm
 impressed
 with
 guidance.
 I
 mean,


look,


they
 keep
 beating
 they
 keep
 beating


earnings.
 They
 keep
 raising
 guidance.


Another
 triple
 beat.
 I
 mean,
 we
 know


notto
 sandbags,
 but
 this
 is
 something


where


it's
 just
 a
 great
 company.


>> Yeah.
 Why
 do
 you
 think
 the
 stock's
 not


reacting
 more
 positively?


>> Because
 it's
 SoFi.


People
 don't
 get
 excited
 about
 SoFi
 for


some
 reason,


>> dude.
 People
 were
 pretty
 excited
 last


night.
 I
 think
 our
 group
 and
 our


community
 is
 excited.
 I
 don't
 think
 the


street
 gets
 excited
 about
 it
 because


look,
 no
 matter
 what
 anybody
 wants
 to


say,
 okay,
 go
 back
 to
 tech
 revenue.
 It's


a
 freaking
 bank.
 You
 know
 what
 I
 mean?


Like
 not
 doesn't
 bring
 the
 same
 energy


as
 Vlad
 when
 talking
 about
 all
 the
 new


products
 for
 some
 reason.
 I
 want
 to
 hear


the
 earnings
 call.
 I
 want
 to
 hear
 what


he
 says
 on
 CNBC
 later
 when
 he
 goes
 on


Tech
 Check
 or
 Kramer,
 whatever
 he
 goes


on.
 But
 Vlad
 has
 a
 way
 and
 Vlad
 has
 an


aura
 about
 him
 when
 he
 is
 discussing


things
 and
 I
 feel
 like
 he
 just
 goes
 into


different
 verticals
 that
 SoFi
 is
 not


going
 to
 go
 into.
 And
 look,
 when
 it


comes
 down
 to
 it,
 this
 reads
 as
 the


earnings
 of
 a
 bank.
 Now,
 it
 may
 be
 a


hyperrowth
 bank,
 but


where's
 most
 of their
 revenue
 coming


from?


>> No,
 I
 get
 it.
 From
 lending,
 it
 makes


sense.
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it
 is
 fair
 to
 say
 it


also
 ran
 up
 before
 the
 earnings.
 I
 mean,


I
 guess
 25
 to
 30
 was
 the
 run.


>> So,
 do
 me
 a
 favor.
 Bring
 up
 stay
 stoic,


be
 stoic
 from
 750.


Like
 I'm
 not
 saying
 I
 want
 him
 to
 pump


the
 stock
 by
 any
 means
 because
 I
 don't.


To
 me
 if
 so
 is
 at
 30
 or
 at
 40
 it
 doesn't


change
 my
 life.
 I
 absolutely
 do
 not
 want


him
 to
 pump
 the
 stock.
 I
 am
 just
 saying


there
 is
 an
 interpretation
 when
 Vlad


talks
 at
 a
 conference
 or
 when
 Sofi
 talks


or
 not
 talks
 on
 a
 conference.
 It's


interpreted
 differently.
 That's
 all
 I'm


saying
 is
 interpreted
 differently
 and


people
 get
 excited
 about
 Robin
 Hood


because
 Robin
 Hood
 is
 looked
 at
 as
 a


tech
 forward
 company
 whereas
 SoFi
 by
 a


lot
 of
 people
 is
 looked
 at
 as
 a
 bank
 and


when
 you
 look
 at
 SoFi's
 numbers
 the


majority
 of
 their
 profitability
 and
 the


majority
 of
 their
 revenue
 is
 from


lending
 and
 financials


which
 are
 traditional
 bank
 segments.


That's
 all
 I'm
 saying.
 I
 mean,
 is
 there


anything
 incorrect
 with
 what
 I
 just


said,
 Emit?


>> No,
 not
 at
 all.


I
 mean,
 look,
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 a


lot
 of
 retail
 is
 excited
 about
 it,


including
 both
 of
 us,
 but
 you
 know,
 I


guess
 the
 running
 from
 25
 to
 30
 wasn't


enough.
 Also,
 again,
 it's
 up
 170%
 or


150%
 for
 the
 year.
 Like,
 no
 one
 can
 be


upset
 if
 it's
 not
 pumping
 another
 10%.


You
 know,
 so
 it's
 like,
 it's
 whatever.


>> I
 mean,
 the
 only
 good
 thing
 about
 this


is
 if
 you
 don't
 get
 a
 pump
 today
 or


tomorrow,
 you
 can
 start
 writing.
 I
 mean,


not
 gonna
 say
 you,
 but
 I
 could
 probably


start
 writing
 cover
 calls
 on
 it.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 have
 a
 thousand
 shares.
 I'd


probably
 start
 writing
 calls
 as
 well.


The
 premiums
 aren't
 good,
 but
 at least


there's
 something
 and
 it's
 a
 good


quality
 company
 that
 you're
 getting
 to


hold,
 you
 know?
 So,


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal,


but
 the
 the
 stock
 did
 make
 a
 big
 move


this
 year.
 And
 so,
 at
 9:30,
 we're
 going


to
 see
 if
 the
 market
 actually
 wants
 to


give
 it
 a
 premium.
 UNH
 is
 up
 3.72%,


folks.
 We
 do
 have
 some
 good
 beats
 on


UNH.
 Um,


>> oh,
 I
 was
 supposed
 to
 tell
 I
 was


supposed
 to
 keep
 something
 quiet,
 but


I'm
 not
 going
 to.


Do
 me
 a
 favor.
 Look
 at
 the
 board
 of
 QXO.


>> Did
 you
 hear
 Chris
 and
 I
 last
 night?


>> No,
 I
 did
 not
 hear
 you
 guys.


>> Oh,
 boy.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 get
 you
 really


interested.


>> Oh,
 I
 see
 it.
 I
 see.
 I
 know.
 Exactly.
 I


know
 exactly.


>> Well,


>> we
 found
 out
 Chris


>> Chris
 brought
 it
 up
 last
 night.
 He


couldn't
 believe
 it.
 I
 didn't
 know


because
 I
 was
 I
 gave
 Chris
 my


twominut
 spiel
 on
 it
 after
 I
 did
 a
 ton


of
 research
 this
 re
 articles.
 So,
 he's


like
 really


gung-ho
 now.


>> All
 right.
 It's
 worth
 it's
 worth
 diving


into.


>> Uh
 UNH
 UNH
 guidance
 of
 16.25.
 That's


better
 than
 expected.
 That
 was
 good.
 EPS


292
 which
 was
 11
 cents
 better
 than


expected.
 revenue
 113.16
 also
 exceeding


the
 estimate
 of
 1136.
 So,
 UNH
 beat
 on


the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom
 which
 is


helping


um
 UPS
 I
 believe
 also


beat
 expectations.
 Yeah,
 EPS
 174
 versus


130
 revenue
 21.4
 versus
 20.
 UPS
 is
 that


up
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 that
 is
 Wow,
 UPS


is
 up
 10%.
 Bro,


>> I
 stopped
 following
 them.
 I
 haven't


looked
 at
 them
 in
 a
 while.
 I


>> I
 I
 just
 think
 it's
 good
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 of


these
 companies
 beat
 on
 top
 and
 bottom


uh
 because
 it's
 indicative
 of
 a


healthier
 market.
 So
 UPS,


SoFi,
 PayPal,
 Wayfair
 beat
 by
 59%.
 My


goodness,
 70
 cents
 versus
 44
 cents


expected.
 And
 then
 3.17
 versus
 3.01


billion.
 Uh,
 Wayfair
 stock
 is


up
 10%.


I
 mean,
 and
 then
 Royal
 Caribbean,
 they


missed
 by
 1%
 on
 revenue,
 beat
 by
 1%
 on


EPS,
 575
 versus
 568,
 5.13
 versus
 5.17


billion
 in
 revenue.
 RCL,


that
 stock
 is
 down
 seven.
 Damn,
 they


missed
 by
 1%


on


revenue
 and
 they
 fell
 7%.


Outside
 of
 that,
 companies
 are
 crushing.


Yeah,
 UPS
 beating
 was
 a
 great
 sign
 going


into
 Christmas
 as
 well


as
 demand
 deliveries
 or
 demand
 for


deliveries
 is
 coming
 back
 as
 at
 a
 higher


level.


Uh,
 for
 those
 that
 own
 PayPal
 in
 the


chat,
 I
 mean,
 what
 are
 your
 thoughts


here?
 It
 looks,


Dude,
 it
 looks
 like
 this
 this
 OpenAI


partnership
 is
 actually
 kind
 of


important.


>> It's
 going
 to
 revitalize
 the
 company.


>> Starting
 next
 year,
 PayPal
 user
 will
 be


able
 to
 shop
 and
 check
 out
 directly
 in


chatbt
 using
 merchants
 can
 list
 and
 sell


their
 inventory
 there.
 PayPal
 will


handle
 routing,
 validation,
 buyer


protection,
 tracking,
 and
 dispute


resolution
 for
 AI
 powered
 commerce.
 That


is
 actually
 something
 if
 Chat
 GBT
 really


wants
 to
 make
 shopping
 a
 thing
 that
 can


significantly
 increase
 PayPal's


transaction
 volumes.


Now
 again,
 I'm
 not
 sure
 how
 many
 people


are
 going
 to
 be
 buying
 on
 Chat
 GBT,
 but


if
 there's,
 you
 know,
 any
 level
 of


significant
 amount,
 that's
 going
 to
 be


important.


Yeah,
 Suchin,
 let
 us
 know
 your
 thoughts.


Suchin
 for
 for
 anyone
 who
 was
 live
 on
 my


channel
 yesterday,
 Suchin
 texted
 me
 at


like
 what
 was
 it
 like
 10
 a.m.
 and
 he


told
 me
 he's
 he's
 buying
 a
 ton
 of


leaps
 on
 on
 PayPal
 for
 January
 2028
 110


strike


>> in
 such
 we
 trust.


>> That
 was
 a
 good
 idea.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 another
 great
 freaking


idea.


>> That
 was
 a
 good
 idea.


Not
 too
 bad.


I
 mean,
 look,
 if
 they
 didn't
 have
 the


opening
 eye
 partnership,
 I
 do
 think
 the


stock
 might
 not
 be
 as
 because
 like
 what


else
 is
 there
 to
 get
 excited
 for?
 I


mean,
 the
 EPS
 beat
 was
 decent.
 Revenue


beat
 7%
 year-over-year
 is
 fine.
 Dividend


is
 cool.
 That
 that's
 important,
 but
 this


open
 AAI
 thing
 can
 it's
 a
 narrative
 that


can
 finally
 get
 people
 like,
 okay,
 this


is
 I
 can
 see
 them,
 you
 know,
 in
 a
 in
 a


in
 a
 different
 level.


>> This
 is
 going
 to
 be
 interesting.
 Amazon


first
 announced
 yesterday
 they
 were


cutting
 30,000
 jobs
 and
 now
 they
 just


made
 another
 announcement
 of
 14,000


jobs.
 Was
 that
 a
 revision
 or
 an


addition?


>> Another
 announcement
 of
 14,000
 that


they're
 cutting


>> or
 I
 guess
 this
 is
 a
 revision
 because


now
 the
 to
 it
 says
 the
 total
 number


affected
 positions
 could
 reach
 as
 many


as
 30,000.
 All right.
 Well,
 Amazon's
 up


in
 the
 pre-market,
 so


Street
 is
 interpreting
 this


not
 in
 a
 bad
 way.
 I
 I I
 think
 Oh,
 yeah.


You
 know,
 you're
 right.
 14,000.
 It
 looks


like
 they
 brought
 it
 down
 from
 they
 said


by
 at least
 14,000.


>> So,
 maybe
 it's
 not
 30,000,
 but
 it's


>> You
 want
 to
 know
 what's
 crazy?


>> What?


>> When
 2025
 is
 in
 the
 books,
 I
 may
 have


been
 too
 bearish.


Is
 that
 not
 going
 to
 be
 crazy
 if
 we


finish
 like
 7,200
 and
 it
 looks
 like
 I


was
 freaking
 bearish.
 Not
 bearish
 may


not
 be
 the
 right
 word,
 but


underestimated
 when
 everybody
 thought
 I


was
 overestimating.
 Like
 whoever
 was


high
 on
 the
 street.


This
 is
 we
 really
 could
 see
 a
 huge
 rally


into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 if
 the
 Fed
 cuts


and
 if
 every
 if
 PayPal
 and
 SoFi
 and
 all


these
 companies
 UNH
 UPS
 if
 they're


beating
 earnings
 what
 do
 we
 think
 the


mega
 caps
 do
 and
 then
 when
 you
 get
 a


rate
 cut
 this
 market
 it
 could
 be
 19


freaking
 89
 all
 over
 again.


I'm
 telling
 you
 I
 think
 people
 are


wrong.
 I
 don't
 think
 we're
 at
 freaking


dinner
 or
 coffee.
 I
 don't
 even
 think
 we


made
 it
 out
 the
 door
 to
 dinner
 yet.


>> I
 I
 do
 think
 the
 Fed
 cutting
 it
 at


alltime
 highs
 is
 bullish
 and
 then
 if


tomorrow
 earnings
 are
 good
 that's


bullish
 and
 then
 if
 the
 AI
 momentum


keeps
 going
 that's
 but
 like
 and
 then
 all


these
 companies
 I
 mean
 what
 significant


company
 has
 missed
 earnings
 badly?
 I


haven't
 seen
 I've
 covered
 pretty
 much


all
 of
 them
 and
 if
 they
 miss
 it's
 by
 you


know
 a
 tiny
 percentage
 and
 maybe
 their


stock
 falls
 because
 they're
 priced
 to


perfection
 but
 there's
 not
 like
 oh


Broadcom
 missed
 by
 20%.
 Like
 there's
 in


2022
 that
 was
 like
 every
 other
 day
 you


would
 have
 a
 company
 miss
 dramatically.


>> Yeah.
 I
 just
 whenever
 I
 hear
 that
 this


is
 1999
 again
 or
 2000
 we're
 getting
 very


close
 to
 the
 bubble.
 You
 know
 I've
 been


Dan
 Ives
 has
 been
 saying
 96.
 I've
 been


saying
 it's
 89
 because
 I
 think
 we're


going
 to
 have
 retracements,
 but
 I
 think


ultimately
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 in
 a
 new


age
 of
 growth
 for
 the
 market.
 I
 really


do.


>> I
 agree.
 All
 right,
 so
 we
 got
 the
 SoFi


call
 in
 a
 minute.
 Uh
 we're
 going
 to
 turn


over
 to
 Notto
 in
 a
 second.


>> At
 least
 I
 have


>> I
 mean
 you
 can
 go
 get
 Oh,
 where'd
 you


get
 the
 Starbucks
 from?


>> I
 told
 you
 I
 went
 outside
 in
 shorts
 and


it
 was
 freezing
 out.
 Oh,
 I
 thought
 you


said
 like
 yesterday
 you
 did
 that
 and


>> No,
 this
 morning
 I
 didn't
 go
 outside
 for


my
 health.


Went
 outside
 to
 get
 coffee,


>> bro.
 You
 didn't
 get
 me
 any
 coffee.


>> That
 would
 have
 been
 a
 really
 good
 magic


trick
 if
 I
 could
 have
 got
 you
 coffee
 for


the
 stream.
 I
 mean,


>> what
 do
 you
 mean
 magic?
 All
 you
 have
 to


do
 is
 drive
 over
 and
 hand
 me
 some.


>> I
 guess
 if
 I
 thought
 about
 it,
 I
 could


have
 freaking
 Uber
 Uber
 eats
 it
 to
 your


house
 and
 had
 it
 show
 up
 on
 your


doorstep.


>> Could
 have.
 You
 really
 didn't.
 Problem


is,
 I've
 never
 used
 Uber
 Eats.
 And
 I


gotta
 say,
 one
 of
 my
 co-workers,
 she's


freaking
 awesome.
 She
 makes
 fun
 of
 me
 so


much.
 She
 says
 I'm
 elderly
 because
 I


still
 call
 restaurants.


>> You've
 told
 us
 the
 story
 like
 50
 times.


>> Hilarious.


>> Like,
 I'm
 not
 elderly.


>> I
 feel
 like
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 pride
 for


saying
 that
 you
 call
 restaurants

 Welcome
 to


SoFi's
 third
 quarter
 2025
 earnings


conference
 call.
 Joining
 me
 today
 to


talk
 about
 our
 results
 in
 recent
 events


are
 Anthony
 Notto,
 CEO,
 and
 Chris
 Le


Point,
 CFO.


You
 can
 find
 the
 presentation


accompanying
 our
 earnings
 release
 on
 the


investor
 relations
 section
 of
 our


website.
 Unless
 otherwise
 stated,
 we'll


be
 referring
 to
 adjusted
 results
 for
 the


third
 quarter
 of
 2025
 versus
 the
 third


quarter
 of
 2024.


Our
 remarks
 today
 will
 include


forward-looking
 statements
 that
 are


based
 on
 our
 current
 expectations
 and


forecasts
 and
 involve
 risks
 and


uncertainties.


These
 statements
 include,
 but
 are
 not


limited
 to
 our
 competitive
 advantage
 and


strategy,
 macroeconomic
 conditions
 and


outlook,
 future
 products
 and
 services,


and
 future
 business
 and
 financial


performance.
 Our
 GAP
 consolidated
 income


statement
 and
 all
 reconciliations
 can
 be


found
 in
 today's
 earnings
 release
 in
 a


subsequent
 10Q
 filing
 which
 will
 be
 made


available
 next
 month.
 Our
 actual
 results


may
 differ
 materially
 from
 those


contemplated
 by
 these
 forward-looking


statements.
 Factors
 that
 could
 cause


these
 results
 to
 differ
 materially
 are


described
 in
 today's
 press
 release
 and


our
 subsequent
 filings
 made
 with
 the


SEC,
 including
 our
 upcoming
 form
 10Q.


Any
 forward-looking
 statements
 that
 we


may
 make
 on
 this
 call
 are
 based
 on


assumptions
 as
 of
 today.
 We
 undertake
 no


obligation
 to
 update
 these
 statements
 as


a
 result
 of
 new
 information
 or
 future


events.
 And
 now
 I'd
 like
 to
 turn
 the


call
 over
 to
 Anthony.


Thank
 you
 and
 good
 morning
 everyone.
 We


had
 an
 excellent
 third
 quarter.
 Our


one-stop
 shop
 strategy
 is
 firing
 on
 all


cylinders
 as
 we
 continue
 to
 deliver


exceptional
 financial
 performance
 while


also
 investing
 in
 our
 business
 to
 drive


durable
 growth
 and
 strong
 returns
 over


the
 long
 term.
 In
 fact,
 our
 focus
 on


product
 innovation
 and
 brand
 building


has
 never
 been
 stronger.
 There's
 more


happening
 at
 SoFi
 today
 than
 at
 any


other
 time
 in
 my
 eight
 years
 with
 the


company.
 We
 are
 stepping
 on
 the
 gas
 to


accelerate
 the
 investment
 in
 our


existing
 businesses
 and
 entering
 new


areas
 like
 crypto
 and
 blockchain
 AI
 SoFi


pay
 providing
 fiat
 and
 crypto
 banking


services
 and
 so
 much
 more.
 I'll
 discuss


some
 of
 these
 efforts
 momentarily,
 but


first
 let
 me
 cover
 our
 key
 results
 for


the
 quarter.
 Starting
 with
 the
 drivers


of
 our
 durable
 growth,
 we
 added
 a
 record


95,000
 new
 members
 in
 Q3,
 increasing


total
 members
 by
 35%
 year-over-year.
 a


slight
 acceleration
 to
 12.6
 million
 SoFi


members.
 We
 also
 added
 a
 record
 1.4


million
 new
 products,
 also
 representing


an
 acceleration
 in
 growth
 to
 36%


year-over-year
 and
 over
 18.6
 million


products.
 Crossby
 reached
 its
 highest


level
 since
 2022


with
 40%
 of
 new
 products
 opened
 by


existing
 SoFi
 members.
 Our
 cross
 by
 rate


has
 increased
 in
 each
 of
 the
 past
 four


quarters,
 demonstrating
 the


effectiveness
 of
 our
 one-stop
 shop


strategy.
 Our
 strong
 member
 and
 product


growth
 powered
 our
 revenue
 growth
 in
 the


third
 quarter.
 Adjusted
 net
 revenue
 was


a
 record
 at
 $950
 million,
 up
 38%


year-over-year.
 Together,
 our
 financial


services
 and
 technology
 platform


segments
 generated
 revenue
 of
 $534


million,
 which
 is
 up
 57%
 year-over-year


and
 now
 represents
 56%
 of
 total
 revenue.


This
 is
 the
 first
 time
 these
 segments


have
 generated
 more
 than
 half
 a
 billion


dollars
 of
 quarterly
 revenue.
 In
 our


lending
 segment,
 adjusted
 net
 revenue


grew
 23%
 year-over-year
 to
 $481
 million


through
 by
 strong
 originations
 in
 the


segment
 of
 $6.6
 6
 billion,
 up
 23%
 from


the
 prior
 year.
 Combined
 with
 the
 very


strong
 $3.4
 billion
 in
 originations
 in


the
 loan
 platform
 business,
 total


originations
 reached
 a
 record
 of
 $9.9


billion
 for
 the
 third
 quarter.
 This
 is


an
 increase
 of
 $1.2
 billion
 from
 our


prior
 record.
 I'm
 also
 proud
 to
 report


that
 total
 feebased
 revenue
 across
 our


business
 was
 also
 a
 quarterly
 record
 at


$49
 million,
 up
 50%
 from
 the
 prior
 year,


driven
 by
 strong
 performance
 from
 our


loan
 platform
 business,
 origination


fees,
 referral
 fees,
 interchange


revenue,
 and
 brokerage
 fee
 revenue.
 On


an
 annualized
 basis,
 we're
 now


generating
 over
 $1.6
 billion
 of
 feebased


revenue,
 reflecting
 the
 deliberate


diversification
 of
 our
 business
 towards


more
 capital
 light
 revenue
 streams.


In
 addition
 to
 delivering
 durable


growth,
 we
 delivered
 strong
 returns
 and


profitability.
 In
 the
 third
 quarter,


adjusted
 EVA
 was
 a
 record
 at
 $277


million,
 up
 nearly
 50%
 year-over-year.


Our
 adjusted
 EVA
 margin
 for
 the
 quarter


was
 29%.


Our
 incremental
 EBIDA
 margin
 was
 35%
 as


we
 continue
 to
 balance
 reinvesting
 in


the
 business
 to
 deliver
 long-term
 growth


and
 delivering
 profitability.
 Net
 income


for
 the
 quarter
 was
 $139
 million
 at
 a


margin
 of
 14%.
 Earnings
 per
 share
 were


11.
 Finally,
 our
 tangible
 book
 value


ended
 the
 quarter
 at
 $7.2
 billion,
 which


includes
 the
 benefit
 from
 a
 successful


opportunistic
 capital
 raise
 during
 the


quarter.
 Over
 the
 past
 two
 years,
 we


have
 more
 than
 doubled
 our
 tangible
 book


value.
 Our
 diversified
 business
 is


uniquely
 built
 to
 deliver
 a
 winning


combination
 of
 growth
 and
 returns.
 One


way
 to
 measure
 the
 success
 is
 the
 rule


of
 40
 calculation,
 which
 is
 revenue


growth
 plus
 IBA
 margin.
 We've
 beaten
 the


rule
 of
 40
 benchmark
 every
 quarter
 since


going
 public.
 That's
 17
 straight


quarters.
 Over
 that
 time,
 our
 average


rule
 of
 40
 score
 is
 58,
 making
 us
 a
 top


performer
 among
 fintexs
 and
 technology


companies
 more
 broadly.
 And
 this


quarter,
 we
 hit
 67%.


Despite
 these
 exceptionally
 strong


results,
 I
 know
 that
 we
 are
 just
 getting


started.
 The
 addressable
 markets
 across


each
 of
 our
 products
 are
 massive
 in
 the


United
 States,
 let
 alone
 in
 addition
 to


international
 markets.
 In
 2026
 and


beyond,
 we
 will
 uniquely
 start
 to


benefit
 from
 both
 of
 the
 technology


super
 cycles
 in
 AI
 and
 blockchain
 where


almost
 every
 other
 industry
 only


benefits
 from
 one.
 And
 with
 nearly
 13


million
 members,
 the
 unmatched


capabilities
 of
 our
 technology,
 and
 the


business
 scale
 of
 $3.8
 $20
 billion
 in


annualized
 revenue
 and
 a
 $45
 billion


balance
 sheet.
 We
 have
 a
 rock-solid


foundation
 to
 build
 on.
 Given
 these


dynamics,
 I've
 never
 been
 more


optimistic
 about
 our
 prospects
 than
 I
 am


today.
 This
 is
 why
 we
 are
 further


accelerating
 our
 level
 of
 investment
 to


make
 our
 existing
 products
 even
 better


by
 providing
 the
 best
 speed,
 selection,


and
 experience
 to
 build
 new
 products
 to


help
 our
 members
 get
 their
 money
 right


and
 to
 further
 strengthen
 our
 trusted


brand
 name.
 Our
 investments
 will
 power


our
 durable
 growth
 and
 drive
 stronger


returns
 as
 we
 continue
 to
 scale.
 Let
 me


now
 spend
 a
 moment
 discussing
 our
 brand


building
 efforts
 which
 are
 key
 to


driving
 new
 members
 to
 SoFi
 and
 create
 a


halo
 effect
 across
 our
 entire
 offering.


During
 the
 third
 quarter,
 we
 launched
 an


exciting
 new
 partnership
 with
 the
 NFL's


most
 valuable
 player,
 Josh
 Allen,
 to


promote
 the
 most
 valuable
 product
 and


financial
 services,
 SoFi
 Plus.
 Our


partnership
 with
 Josh
 is
 resonating
 with


NFL
 fans,
 driving
 a
 35%
 increase
 in


unaded
 brand
 awareness
 among
 that
 target


audience.
 Along
 with
 our
 broader


marketing
 efforts,
 we
 drove
 unaded
 brand


awareness
 to
 an
 all-time
 high
 of
 9.1%


during
 the
 quarter
 from
 last
 quarter's


record
 of
 8.5%
 and
 more
 than
 4x
 higher


than
 it
 was
 when
 we
 went
 public.
 Turning


now
 to
 our
 product
 innovation.
 Last


quarter,
 I
 spoke
 about
 how
 we
 are
 an


unprecedented
 point
 in
 time
 with
 two


technology
 super
 cycles
 taking
 place
 in


crypto,
 blockchain,
 and
 AI.
 These
 super


cycles
 have
 the
 power
 to
 completely


reinvent
 the
 future
 of
 financial


services,
 and
 we
 have
 moved
 fast
 to
 take


advantage
 of
 these
 opportunities.
 I'm


pleased
 to
 report
 that
 this
 week
 we


launched
 our
 first
 payment
 product
 that


leverages
 blockchain
 technology
 to


provide
 fast,
 seamless,
 lowcost,
 and


safe
 international
 payments
 with
 the


launch
 of
 SoFi
 Pay.
 SoFi
 Pay
 gives


members
 the
 ability
 to
 seamlessly
 send


money
 in
 local
 fiat
 abroad
 by
 leveraging


a
 layer
 2
 blockchain
 network
 and


delivering
 local
 fiat
 into
 the
 account


of
 the
 recipient.
 It's
 fully
 automated


in
 the
 SoFi
 app
 at
 sniffly
 faster
 speeds


and
 lower
 costs
 compared
 to
 traditional


services.
 Members
 will
 first
 be
 able
 to


send
 money
 to
 Mexico
 with
 planned
 stage


rollouts
 in
 Europe
 and
 South
 America
 in


the
 near
 future.
 The
 SoFi
 Pay
 wallet


will
 over
 time
 integrate
 SoFi
 USD


stablecoin
 that
 we
 hope
 to
 launch
 in


2026.
 We
 also
 have
 plans
 to
 offer
 the


SoFi
 Pay
 app
 natively
 in
 international


markets
 for
 foreign
 citizens
 to
 send


money
 to
 the
 US
 and
 many
 other


international
 markets.
 This
 is
 another


addition
 to
 our
 unprecedented
 money


movement
 offering
 which
 allows
 members


to
 seamlessly
 send
 money
 through


person-toperson
 payments
 with
 a
 phone


number
 or
 email
 address
 as
 well
 as
 zel


AC
 self-s
 serve
 wires
 and
 now
 the


ability
 to
 send
 money
 internationally


with
 SoFi
 pay.
 I
 am
 also
 excited
 to


share
 that
 this
 quarter
 we'll
 be


launching
 actually
 relaunching
 the


ability
 to
 buy,
 sell,
 and
 hold
 crypto


assets
 which
 will
 give
 members
 access
 to


dozens
 of
 tokens
 directly
 in
 our
 SoFi


app.
 Beyond
 offering
 the
 best
 selection,


we
 will
 also
 be
 providing
 the
 best
 speed


and
 convenience.
 Members
 can
 instantly


fund
 buying
 cryptocurrencies
 from
 their


FDIC
 insured
 SoFi
 money
 account,
 all


within
 the
 integrated
 SoFi
 app.
 Members


will
 also
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 transfer


the
 crypto
 assets
 to
 SoFi
 and
 benefit


from
 our
 broad
 range
 of
 products
 that


are
 seamlessly
 integrated
 with
 our
 SoFi


North
 American
 Bank.
 And
 because
 many
 of


our
 members
 may
 be
 new
 to
 crypto


investing,
 we
 will
 support
 them
 with
 the


best
 content
 to
 help
 them
 understand


crypto
 investing
 and
 provide
 them
 with


the
 peace
 of
 mind
 that
 comes
 from


working
 with
 a
 regulated
 bank.
 But
 this


is
 just
 the
 beginning
 of
 our
 ambitious


crypto
 and
 blockchain
 product
 roadmap


that
 will
 continue
 to
 come
 to
 life
 in


2026.
 I
 could
 not
 be
 more
 excited
 about


the
 product
 roadmap
 and
 the
 multitude
 of


use
 cases
 we
 have
 for
 our
 planned
 stable


coin
 SoFi
 USD
 and
 our
 ability
 to


differentiate
 a
 stable
 coin
 like
 no


other
 company
 given
 our
 unique
 bank


license
 technology
 capabilities


portfolio
 products
 and
 technology


platform
 services.
 Turning
 now
 to
 the


other
 super
 cycle
 AI.
 We
 continue
 to


test
 and
 implement
 a
 number
 of
 AI


applications
 across
 our
 business.
 Behind


the
 scenes,
 AI
 technology
 has
 been
 key


to
 streamlining
 our
 operations
 to
 better


serve
 our
 members.
 This
 has
 included


using
 AI
 to
 promote
 higher
 quality


engagement
 and
 giving
 our
 frontline


member
 service
 team
 AIdriven
 tools
 to


more
 quickly
 identify
 and
 resolve
 member


issues.
 AI
 is
 also
 now
 being
 used
 to


directly
 support
 members.
 Our
 AI
 support


chat
 is
 helping
 members
 resolve


questions
 in
 an
 efficient
 way,
 driving
 a


noticeable
 impact
 on
 member


satisfaction.
 It's
 currently
 integrated


with
 our
 money
 and
 card
 products
 and


will
 be
 rolled
 out
 across
 the
 entire


SoFi
 platform
 this
 quarter.


We've
 also
 launched
 the
 AIdriven
 Cash


Coach
 to
 qualifying
 members.
 Here's
 how


it
 works.
 From
 the
 home
 screen,
 members


see
 a
 button
 saying
 cash
 to
 optimize.
 By


tapping
 that
 button,
 the
 cash
 coach
 will


look
 across
 both
 their
 SoFi
 and
 external


accounts
 to
 see
 where
 cash
 utilization


is
 suboptimal
 and
 provide
 them
 with


personalized
 financial
 suggestions.
 For


example,
 if
 a
 member
 is
 earning
 just
 two


lousy
 basis
 points
 of
 interest
 on


deposits
 with
 a
 big
 bank,
 it
 may
 suggest


moving
 that
 cash
 to
 a
 SoFi
 account


earning
 3.8%.
 Paying
 down
 a
 big
 bank


credit
 card
 balance
 from
 a
 big
 bank
 that


has
 a
 25%
 interest
 rate.
 Cash
 Coach
 is


just
 the
 beginning.
 Next
 year,
 we
 will


launch
 a
 more
 comprehensive
 SoFi
 coach


that
 incorporates
 insights
 across
 all


areas
 of
 financial
 activity,
 not
 just


cash,
 which
 will
 be
 able
 to
 help
 members


understand
 how
 to
 spend
 less
 than
 they


make
 and
 invest
 the
 rest
 by
 breaking


down
 what
 they
 must
 do,
 what
 they
 should


do,
 and
 what
 they
 can
 do
 every
 day


across
 their
 entire
 financial
 lives.
 For


example,
 they
 could
 ask
 the
 SoFi
 coach


questions
 like,
 "How
 has
 my
 credit
 score


changed?
 How
 can
 I
 reduce
 my
 cost
 of


debt?
 How
 much
 do
 I
 spend
 on


subscriptions?
 How
 diversified
 is
 my


portfolio?
 How
 is
 my
 investing
 compared


to
 others
 my
 age?
 Over
 time,
 SoFi
 Coach


will
 be
 able
 to
 do
 even
 more,
 like


provide
 investment
 and
 lending
 options


to
 choose
 from,
 help
 set
 up
 and
 track


goals,
 and
 simplify
 processes
 like


cancelling
 subscriptions
 and
 optimizing


reward
 points.
 We
 are
 so
 excited
 about


how
 this
 AIdriven
 tool
 will
 help
 engage


members
 and
 help
 them
 spend
 less
 than


they
 make
 so
 they
 can
 invest
 the
 rest.


Ultimately,
 SoFi
 Coach
 will
 supercharge


our
 financial
 services
 productivity
 loop


and
 lead
 to
 a
 deeper
 relationship
 that


drive
 a
 higher
 lifetime
 value.
 Turning


now
 to
 product
 innovation
 within
 our


segments,
 starting
 with
 the
 financial


services
 segment
 and
 the
 loan
 platform


business.
 LPB
 has
 been
 a
 gamecher
 for


SoFi,
 diversifying
 our
 lending
 activity


in
 a
 capital
 light,
 low-risk
 way.
 It's
 a


prime
 example
 of
 how
 we
 can
 leverage
 our


unique
 tech,
 customer
 acquisition,
 and


operations
 capabilities
 to
 to
 build
 a


differentiated
 platform
 at
 scale.
 During


the
 third
 quarter,
 we
 originated
 $3.4


billion
 of
 loans
 through
 our
 loan


platform
 business,
 an
 increase
 of
 over


$900
 million
 from
 just
 last
 quarter.
 On


an
 annualized
 basis,
 after
 just
 one


year,
 this
 business
 is
 now
 running
 at
 a


pace
 of
 over$1
 13
 billion
 of


originations
 and
 $660
 million
 of
 high


margin,
 high
 return
 feebased
 revenue.


Importantly,
 we
 continue
 to
 increase
 the


loan
 platform
 business
 near-term
 volume


that
 is
 outside
 of
 our
 traditional


credit
 box,
 effectively
 monetizing
 more


of
 the
 roughly
 $100
 billion
 of
 loan


applications
 that
 we
 were
 not
 able
 to


meet
 each
 year.
 Looking
 ahead,
 the


opportunity
 for
 this
 business
 remains


significant
 and
 demand
 from
 our
 partners


continues
 to
 increase.
 Recently,
 as
 some


concerns
 have
 emerged
 within
 the
 private


credit
 markets,
 we've
 actually
 seen
 our


LPB
 partners
 lean
 in
 to
 do
 more
 with


SoFi,
 not
 less,
 reflecting
 a
 flight
 to


quality
 and
 durability
 through
 interest


rate
 and
 economic
 cycles.
 We
 have
 worked


hard
 over
 the
 last
 eight
 years
 to


develop
 unique
 skills
 in
 underwriting,


marketing,
 pricing,
 insights,
 and
 data.


And
 as
 such,
 we
 are
 benefiting
 from
 this


flight
 to
 quality.
 Turning
 to
 invest,


earlier
 this
 month
 we
 launched
 level
 one


options
 which
 has
 been
 consistently
 a


requested
 feature
 by
 our
 members.


Options
 are
 another
 way
 we
 are
 providing


access
 to
 our
 members
 that
 they


otherwise
 wouldn't
 have
 so
 they
 can


build
 portfolios
 that
 align
 with
 their


financial
 goals.
 As
 part
 of
 this


rollout,
 we
 also
 provide
 educational


resources
 explaining
 how
 options
 work,


the
 risks
 involved,
 and
 how
 to
 integrate


them
 responsibly
 into
 a
 diversified


investment
 strategy.
 Beyond
 options,


we're
 also
 expanding
 our
 unmatched


selection
 in
 the
 third
 quarter
 by


providing
 access
 to
 IPOs
 like
 StubHub,


CLA,
 and
 Figma,
 and
 by
 launching
 the


Sofi
 Agentic
 AI
 ETF.
 During
 the
 quarter,


we
 also
 improved
 our
 features
 to
 make


our
 invest
 products
 more
 intuitive
 and


engaging.
 For
 example,
 we
 launched
 247


instant
 transfers
 between
 invest
 and


money.
 And
 we
 launched
 embedded


rollovers
 and
 an
 enhanced
 rollover


tracker
 giving
 members
 full
 visibility


and
 control
 over
 their
 401k
 rollover


process.
 In
 the
 fourth
 quarter,
 we'll
 be


making
 a
 number
 of
 additional


enhancements.
 We
 are
 very
 excited
 about


the
 progress
 made
 to
 build
 an
 investment


platform
 that
 provides
 our
 members
 with


way
 more
 options
 than
 what
 they
 would


typically
 have
 access
 to.
 Turning
 now
 to


SoFi
 Money,
 which
 has
 been
 a
 core
 part


of
 our
 financial
 services
 productivity


loop.
 In
 three
 years
 after
 acquiring
 our


banking
 license,
 we
 have
 6.3
 million


products
 and
 33
 billion
 of
 deposits.
 Our


attractive
 APY
 is
 a
 compelling
 reason


for
 members
 to
 make
 us
 their
 primary


financial
 institution.
 But
 members
 also


come
 to
 us
 for
 our
 best-in-class


products
 and
 continue
 innovation.
 For


example,
 we
 will
 soon
 be
 launching
 the


SoFi
 Smart
 Card,
 a
 new
 card
 that
 brings


together
 the
 best
 features
 to
 help
 our


members
 spend,
 save,
 and
 pay
 better.
 It


will
 be
 part
 of
 our
 SoFi
 Plus
 offering,


and
 it
 will
 serve
 as
 a
 platform
 for


continuous
 innovation.
 The
 card
 will


offer
 5%
 back
 on
 food,
 our
 highest


interest
 rate
 on
 deposits,
 credit


builder
 capabilities,
 borrowing


capabilities,
 and
 so
 much
 more.
 This
 is


yet
 another
 way
 in
 which
 we
 are
 pushing


the
 limits
 on
 what
 is
 possible
 with


banking
 products.


Turning
 now
 to
 our
 lending
 segment.


Lending
 is
 the
 most
 tenured
 core


capability
 of
 SoFi
 and
 is
 how
 our


business
 got
 its
 start.
 Since
 that
 time,


we
 have
 made
 significant
 uh
 progress


strengthening
 both
 our
 member


acquisition
 and
 our
 underwriting


capabilities.
 For
 loans
 that
 we
 hold
 on


our
 balance
 sheet,
 we
 focus
 exclusively


on
 high
 prime
 and
 superprime
 borrowers


with
 strong
 cash
 flow
 and
 FICO
 scores.


In
 fact,
 the
 average
 FICO
 score
 of
 our


personal
 loan
 borrower
 is
 745
 and
 our


student
 loan
 borrower
 is
 773.


But
 we
 don't
 stop
 at
 credit
 scores.
 We


use
 tried
 and
 trueue
 underwriting


techniques
 to
 assess
 each
 individual


borrower's
 cash
 flow
 and
 their
 ability


to
 repay
 their
 loan.
 We
 are
 able
 to
 do


this
 effectively
 at
 scale
 because
 of
 our


innovative
 originations
 platform
 that


leverages
 advanced
 technology
 and


digitally
 enabled
 processes.
 The
 result


is
 excellent
 credit
 performance
 that


continues
 today.
 In
 fact,
 during
 the


third
 quarter,
 we
 saw
 our
 net
 charge
 off


rates
 improve
 even
 as
 there
 has
 been


moderate
 signs
 of
 stress
 showing
 up
 for


some
 other
 companies.
 For
 both
 personal


loans
 and
 student
 loans,
 net
 charge
 offs


were
 down
 more
 than
 20
 basis
 points
 in


the
 third
 quarter.
 We
 also
 have
 a
 strong


track
 record
 of
 building
 great
 lending


products
 that
 help
 our
 members
 create
 a


better
 future.
 For
 example,
 our


innovative
 personal
 loan
 product
 allows


members
 to
 refinance
 observably


expensive
 credit
 card
 debt
 held
 at
 other


institutions
 to
 save
 their
 hard-earned


money.
 No
 longer
 will
 overachievers
 be


suckered
 into
 chasing
 rewards
 only
 to


realize
 they
 are
 paying
 over
 20%


interest
 on
 unpaid
 principal
 balances


while
 earning
 essentially
 no
 interest
 on


that
 same
 bank's
 deposit
 account.


We've
 recently
 made
 this
 product
 even


more
 attractive
 to
 our
 members
 by


rolling
 out
 an
 interestonly
 period
 to


raise
 awareness
 of
 the
 personal
 loan


product
 and
 help
 ease
 the
 transition


from
 making
 credit
 card
 payments
 to


making
 personal
 loan
 payments.


Similarly,
 in
 student
 lending,
 we
 have


completely
 changed
 the
 game,
 becoming


the
 preeminent
 company
 for
 refinancing


student
 debt
 at
 more
 affordable
 rates.


Our
 student
 loan
 refinance
 product
 can


reduce
 a
 member's
 interest
 rate
 by
 a


couple
 hundred
 basis
 points,
 which
 will


have
 a
 meaningful
 impact
 with
 a
 $40,000


loan
 balance.
 In
 fact,
 we
 estimate
 that


we
 will
 save
 our
 members
 over
 $100


million
 in
 interest
 expense
 just
 on
 the


student
 loans
 we
 refinanced
 during
 the


third
 quarter.
 This
 is
 why
 we've
 made


our
 product
 even
 more
 attractive
 by


rolling
 out
 a
 feature
 that
 allows
 for


the
 gradual
 step
 up
 in
 payments
 to
 help


members
 find
 their
 footing.
 We
 look


forward
 to
 helping
 even
 more
 members


refinance
 their
 student
 loans
 as


interest
 rates
 come
 down
 in
 the
 future.


Turning
 now
 to
 home
 lending
 where
 we
 are


seeing
 very
 strong
 results.
 In
 the
 midst


of
 the
 higher
 rate
 environment,
 we
 built


and
 launched
 a
 home
 equity
 loan
 product


to
 help
 members
 take
 advantage
 of
 their


equity
 that
 has
 been
 built
 up
 in
 their


homes,
 particularly
 over
 the
 last
 few


years.
 In
 the
 third
 quarter,
 just
 one


year
 after
 launch,
 we
 originated
 over


$350
 million
 of
 home
 equity
 loans,


helping
 us
 set
 a
 record
 of
 $945
 million


of
 originations
 for
 all
 of
 home
 lending.


In
 fact,
 Q4
 will
 likely
 be
 the
 first


quarter
 where
 we
 generate
 more
 revenue


from
 home
 loans
 than
 from
 student
 loan


referance,
 which
 was
 our
 first
 product


and
 the
 largest
 product
 prior
 to
 CO.
 At


the
 same
 time,
 we're
 preparing
 for
 lower


rates
 to
 further
 accelerate
 our
 home


loans
 business
 in
 2026.
 We've
 not
 only


strengthened
 our
 operations,
 but
 we
 have


also
 enhanced
 our
 product
 to
 make
 them


very
 attractive
 to
 our
 estimated
 3


million
 members
 who
 currently
 have


mortgages
 elsewhere
 and
 to
 those
 who
 may


be
 first-time
 home
 buyers.
 We
 believe


our
 offering
 will
 drive
 strong
 growth
 as


the
 market
 opens
 up.
 Turning
 to
 our
 tech


platform
 segment,


this
 business
 has
 been
 instrumental
 in


our
 ability
 to
 innovate
 across
 the
 SoFi


platform
 and
 it's
 now
 allowing
 a
 broader


range
 of
 companies
 to
 bring
 innovative


programs
 that
 drive
 greater
 loyalty
 and


engagement
 to
 their
 customers.
 In
 fact,


today
 we
 are
 incredibly
 excited
 to


announce
 our
 newest
 partnership
 with
 one


of
 the
 largest
 airlines
 in
 North


America,
 Southwest
 Airlines,
 to
 power


their
 rapid
 rewards
 debit
 card,
 which


combines
 the
 convenience
 of
 debit


payments
 while
 earning
 points
 on


everyday
 purchases.


We've
 also
 signed
 on
 two
 major
 consumer


brands,
 our
 largest
 shet,
 which
 will
 be


announced
 in
 due
 course.
 These


partnerships
 are
 a
 reflection
 of
 the


strong
 and
 growing
 demand
 for
 our


marketleading
 technology
 to
 power


embedded
 financial
 products
 at
 scale
 for


some
 of
 the
 most
 well-known
 brands


around
 the
 world.
 As
 you
 can
 see,
 it
 was


an
 eventful
 third
 quarter
 at
 SoFi,
 and


we
 are
 as
 energized
 as
 ever
 as
 we
 wrap


up
 the
 year
 and
 head
 into
 2026.
 With


that,
 let
 me
 now
 turn
 the
 call
 over
 to


Chris.
 Thank
 you,
 Anthony.
 We've


delivered
 another
 strong
 quarter
 as
 we


continue
 to
 drive
 durable
 growth
 and


strong
 returns
 on
 the
 way
 to
 delivering


record
 revenue
 in
 our
 eighth
 consecutive


profitable
 quarter.
 For
 the
 quarter,


revenue
 grew
 38%
 year-over-year
 to
 a


record
 $950
 million.
 Adjusted
 EVA
 was


also
 a
 record
 at
 $277
 million
 and
 a


margin
 of
 29%.


Net
 income
 was
 $139
 million
 at
 a
 margin


of
 14%.
 And
 earnings
 per
 share
 was
 11


cents.


Similar
 to
 the
 last
 two
 quarters,
 this


included
 a
 small
 benefit
 related
 to
 a


lower
 tax
 rate.


An
 important
 driver
 of
 our
 growth
 was


the
 increased
 contribution
 from


Capitalite
 non-
 lending
 as
 well
 as


feebased
 revenue
 sources.


Our
 non-
 lending
 businesses
 generated


$534
 million
 of
 revenue
 up
 57%


year-over-year.
 And
 we
 also
 generated


record
 feebased
 revenue
 across
 all


segments
 of
 $49
 million,
 up
 50%


year-over-year.


Turning
 now
 to
 our
 segment
 performance.


In
 terms
 of
 financial
 services
 for
 the


third
 quarter,
 net
 revenue
 was
 $420


million,
 up
 76%
 year-over-year.


Contribution
 profit
 was
 $226
 million,
 up


nearly
 2.3x
 from
 last
 year.
 Contribution


margin
 was
 54%
 up
 from
 42%
 last
 year.


Net
 interest
 income
 for
 this
 segment
 was


$24
 million,
 up
 32%
 year-over-year,


which
 was
 primarily
 driven
 by
 growth
 in


member
 deposits.


Non-interest
 income
 grew
 nearly
 2.6x
 to


$216
 million
 for
 the
 quarter,
 which


equates
 to
 over
 $860
 million
 in


highquality
 feebased
 income
 on
 an


annualized
 basis.


Importantly,
 improved
 monetization


continues
 its
 strong
 contribution
 to


revenue
 growth.
 Financial
 services


revenue
 per
 product
 surpassed
 $100
 for


the
 first
 time,
 reaching
 a
 record
 $104


in
 the
 third
 quarter.
 That's
 up
 over
 28%


year-over-year.
 And
 we
 see
 continued


upside
 as
 newer
 products
 mature.


In
 Q3,
 our
 loan
 platform
 business


generated
 $168
 million
 in
 adjusted
 net


revenue,
 up
 29%
 from
 just
 last
 quarter.


Of
 this,
 $165
 million
 was
 driven
 by
 the


$3.4
 $4
 billion
 of
 personal
 loans


originated
 on
 behalf
 of
 third
 parties
 as


well
 as
 referrals.


Additionally,
 LPB
 generated
 $3
 million


from
 servicing
 cash
 flows,
 which
 is


recorded
 in
 our
 lending
 segment.
 The


growth
 opportunity
 for
 this
 business


continues
 to
 be
 very
 strong.


Beyond
 our
 LPB
 revenue,
 we
 continue
 to


see
 healthy
 growth
 in
 interchange,
 up


55%
 year-over-year,
 driven
 by
 close
 to


20
 billion
 in
 total
 annualized
 spend
 in


the
 quarter
 across
 money
 and
 credit


card.


Shifting
 to
 our
 tech
 platform,
 for
 the


third
 quarter,
 we
 delivered
 net
 revenue


of
 $115
 million,
 up
 12%
 year-over-year.


Contribution
 profit
 was
 $32
 million
 at
 a


contribution
 margin
 of
 28%.


Revenue
 growth
 was
 driven
 by
 continued


monetization
 of
 existing
 clients
 along


with
 new
 deals
 signed
 in
 new
 client


segments.


Turning
 now
 to
 our
 lending
 segment.
 For


the
 third
 quarter,
 adjusted
 net
 revenue


was
 $481
 million,
 up
 23%
 from
 the
 same


period
 last
 year.
 Contribution
 profit


was
 $262
 million
 with
 a
 54%
 contribution


margin.


These
 strong
 results
 were
 primarily


driven
 by
 growth
 in
 net
 interest
 income,


which
 increased
 35%
 year-over-year
 to


$428
 million.


During
 the
 quarter,
 we
 had
 record
 total


loan
 originations
 of
 $9.9
 billion,
 up


57%
 year-over-year.


Personal
 loan
 originations
 were
 a
 record


at
 $7.5
 billion,
 of
 which
 $3.4
 billion


was
 originated
 on
 behalf
 of
 third


parties
 through
 LPB.


In
 total,
 personal
 loan
 originations


were
 up
 53%
 year-over-year.


Student
 loan
 originations
 were
 $1.5


billion,
 up
 58%
 from
 the
 same
 period


last
 year.
 And
 home
 loan
 originations


were
 a
 record
 $945
 million,
 a


year-over-year
 increase
 of
 nearly
 2x.


Capital
 markets
 activity
 was
 very
 strong


in
 the
 third
 quarter.
 We
 sold
 and


transferred
 through
 our
 loan
 platform


business
 a
 record
 $4.6
 6
 billion
 of


personal,
 home,
 and
 student
 loans.


In
 terms
 of
 personal
 loans,
 we
 closed


$175
 million
 of
 sales
 in
 whole
 loan
 form


at
 a
 blended
 execution
 of
 106.4%.


All
 deals
 had
 similar
 structures
 to


other
 recent
 personal
 loan
 sales
 with


cash
 proceeds
 at
 or
 nearpar
 and
 the


majority
 of
 the
 premium
 consisting
 of


contractual
 servicing
 fees
 that
 are


capitalized.


These
 sales
 included
 a
 small
 loss
 share


provision
 that
 is
 above
 our
 base


assumption
 of
 losses
 and
 immaterial


relative
 to
 the
 exposure
 we
 would
 have


had
 otherwise
 if
 we
 held
 on
 to
 the


loans.


Additionally,
 we
 sold
 $90
 million
 of


latestage
 delinquent
 personal
 loans.
 By


selling
 these
 loans,
 we're
 able
 to


generate
 positive
 incremental
 value
 over


time
 versus
 selling
 after
 they
 charge


off,
 both
 from
 our
 improved
 recovery


capabilities
 and
 by
 maintaining


servicing.


In
 terms
 of
 home
 loan
 sales,
 we
 closed


$585
 million
 at
 a
 blended
 execution
 of


102.9%.


And
 in
 terms
 of
 student
 loan
 sales,
 we


closed
 $377
 million
 at
 a
 blended


execution
 of
 105.9%.


In
 addition
 to
 our
 loan
 sales,
 we


executed
 a
 $466
 million
 securization
 of


loans
 originated
 through
 our
 loan


platform
 business.


This
 channel
 provides
 our
 partners
 with


meaningful
 liquidity
 to
 support
 their


ongoing
 investment
 in
 the
 loan
 platform


business.
 The
 transaction
 priced
 at


industry-leading
 cost
 of
 funds
 levels


with
 a
 weighted
 average
 spread
 of
 98


basis
 points.


Turning
 to
 credit
 performance,
 the


health
 of
 our
 consumer
 remains
 strong


and
 our
 credit
 continues
 to
 improve.
 Our


personal
 loan
 borrowers
 have
 a
 weighted


average
 income
 of
 $157,000


and
 a
 weighted
 average
 FICO
 score
 of


$745.


While
 our
 student
 loan
 borrowers
 also


have
 a
 weighted
 average
 income
 of


$157,000


with
 a
 weighted
 average
 FICO
 score
 of


773.


For
 personal
 loans,
 the
 annualized


charge
 off
 rate
 declined
 by
 more
 than
 20


basis
 points
 to
 2.6%
 from
 2.83%
 in
 the


prior
 quarter.
 Had
 we
 not
 sold
 any
 late


stage
 delinquencies,
 we
 estimate
 that


including
 recoveries
 between
 90
 and
 120


days
 delinquent,
 we
 would
 have
 had
 an


all-in
 annualized
 net
 charge
 off
 rate


for
 personal
 loans
 of
 approximately
 4.2%


versus
 4.5%
 last
 quarter.
 The
 onbalance


sheet
 90-day
 delinquency
 rate
 was
 43


basis
 points,
 consistent
 with
 the
 prior


quarter.
 For
 student
 loans,
 the


annualized
 charge
 off
 rate
 also
 declined


more
 than
 20
 basis
 points
 to
 69
 basis


points
 from
 94
 basis
 points
 in
 the
 prior


quarter.


The
 onbalance
 sheet
 90-day
 delinquency


rate
 was
 14
 basis
 points,
 consistent


with
 the
 prior
 quarter.


The
 data
 continues
 to
 support
 our
 7
 to8%


net
 cumulative
 loss
 assumption
 for


personal
 loans
 in
 line
 with
 our


underwriting
 tolerance.
 Although
 we


continue
 to
 trend
 below
 these
 levels,


our
 recent
 vintages
 originated
 from
 Q4


2022
 to
 Q4
 2024
 have
 net
 cumulative


losses
 of
 4.4%
 with
 39%
 unpaid
 principal


balance
 remaining.
 This
 is
 well
 below


the
 6.08%


observed
 at
 the
 same
 point
 in
 time
 for


the
 2017
 vintage,
 the
 last
 vintage
 that


approached
 our
 7
 to
 8%
 tolerance.


The
 gap
 between
 the
 newer
 cohort
 curve


and
 the
 2017
 cohort
 curve
 widened
 by
 a


more
 favorable
 29
 basis
 points
 after
 a


widening
 improvement
 of
 19
 basis
 points


in
 Q2.


Additionally,
 looking
 at
 our
 Q1
 2020


through
 Q2
 2025
 originations,
 60%
 of


principal
 has
 already
 been
 paid
 down


with
 6.7%
 in
 net
 cumulative
 losses.


Therefore,
 for
 LIFA
 loan
 losses
 on
 this


entire
 cohort
 of
 loans
 to
 reach
 8%,
 the


charge
 off
 rate
 on
 the
 remaining
 40%
 of


unpaid
 principal
 would
 need
 to
 be


approximately
 10%.


This
 would
 be
 well
 above
 past
 levels,


further
 underscoring
 our
 confidence
 in


achieving
 loss
 rates
 below
 our
 8%


tolerance.


Turning
 to
 our
 fair
 value
 marks
 and
 key


assumptions.
 As
 a
 reminder,
 we
 mark
 our


loans
 at
 fair
 value
 each
 quarter,
 which


considers
 a
 number
 of
 factors,
 including


the
 weighted
 average
 coupon,
 the


constant
 default
 rate,
 the
 conditional


prepayment
 rate,
 and
 the
 discount
 rate


comprised
 of
 benchmark
 rates
 and


spreads.


At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 third
 quarter,
 our


personal
 loans
 were
 marked
 at
 105.7%


in
 line
 with
 the
 prior
 quarter.
 This
 was


primarily
 a
 function
 of
 a
 lower


benchmark
 rate
 which
 was
 mo
 mostly


offset
 by
 higher
 prepayments
 and
 a


modest
 change
 to
 the
 weighted
 average


coupon
 as
 well
 as
 a
 modest
 change
 to
 the


annual
 default
 rate
 which
 was
 driven
 by


loan
 vintage
 seasoning
 not
 changes
 to


the
 individual
 loan
 loss
 assumptions.


At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 third
 quarter,
 our


student
 loans
 were
 also
 marked
 at
 105.7%


down
 nine
 basis
 points
 from
 the
 prior


quarter.
 This
 was
 a
 function
 of
 a
 modest


decrease
 in
 the
 weighted
 average
 coupon


partially
 offset
 by
 a
 lower
 benchmark


rate.


Turning
 to
 our
 balance
 sheet,
 in
 July
 we


raised
 $1.7
 billion
 of
 new
 capital
 in


the
 form
 of
 common
 equity.
 This


opportunistic
 raise
 significantly


increased
 our
 capital
 levels
 and
 allowed


us
 to
 reduce
 our
 higher
 cost
 debt
 by


$1.2
 billion,
 making
 our
 balance
 sheet


even
 stronger
 and
 giving
 us
 great


flexibility
 to
 pursue
 growth


opportunities.


In
 the
 third
 quarter,
 including
 this
 new


capital,
 total
 assets
 grew
 by
 $4.2


billion.
 This
 was
 driven
 by
 $2.7
 billion


of
 loan
 growth
 and
 approximately
 $1.2


billion
 of
 growth
 in
 cash,
 cash


equivalents,
 and
 investment
 securities.


Total
 companywide
 cash
 at
 quarter
 end


was
 $3.7
 billion.


On
 the
 liability
 side,
 total
 deposits


grew
 by
 $3.4
 4
 billion
 to
 $32.9
 billion,


primarily
 driven
 by
 growth
 in
 member


deposits.


Net
 interest
 margin
 was
 5.84%
 for
 the


quarter,
 down
 two
 basis
 points


sequentially.
 This
 included
 a
 seven


basis
 point
 decrease
 in
 average
 yields


as
 we
 saw
 a
 modest
 mix
 shift
 from


personal
 loans
 to
 home
 and
 student
 loans


and
 a
 three
 basis
 point
 increase
 in
 cost


of
 funds
 which
 was
 mostly
 offset
 by


strong
 growth
 in
 interest
 earning


assets.
 We
 continue
 to
 expect
 healthy


net
 interest
 margins
 above
 5%
 for
 the


foreseeable
 future.


In
 terms
 of
 our
 regulatory
 capital


ratios,
 we
 remain
 very
 well
 capitalized.


Our
 total
 capital
 ratio
 of
 20.2%
 at


quarter
 end
 is
 well
 above
 the
 regulatory


minimum
 of
 10
 a.5%
 as
 well
 as
 our


additional
 internal
 stress
 buffer.


Tangible
 book
 value
 grew
 $
 1.9
 billion


sequentially
 to
 $7.2
 $2
 billion,


including
 the
 benefit
 from
 the
 new


capital
 raised.
 And
 tangible
 book
 value


per
 share
 at
 quarter
 end
 is
 $5.97,


up
 from
 $48


a
 year
 ago,
 a
 46%
 increase.


Let
 me
 now
 finish
 by
 providing
 our


revised
 outlook
 for
 2025.


As
 we
 head
 into
 fourth
 quarter
 for
 the


full
 year
 2025,
 we
 now
 expect
 to
 add


approximately
 3.5
 million
 members,
 which


represents
 approximately
 34%


year-over-year
 growth,
 above
 our
 prior


guidance
 of
 3
 million
 members
 and
 30%


growth.
 We
 now
 expect
 adjusted
 net


revenue
 of
 approximately
 3.54
 billion,


above
 our
 prior
 guidance
 of
 3.375


billion.


This
 equates
 to
 year-over-year
 growth
 of


approximately
 36%,
 an
 increase
 from
 our


prior
 guide
 of
 30%.


We
 now
 expect
 an
 adjusted
 EBIDA
 of


approximately
 1.035
 billion
 above
 our


prior
 guidance
 of
 $960
 million.


This
 represents
 a
 29%
 margin.
 We
 now


expect
 adjusted
 net
 income
 of


approximately
 $455
 million
 above
 our


prior
 guidance
 of
 $370
 million.


an
 adjusted
 EPS
 of
 approximately
 37


cents
 above
 our
 prior
 guidance
 of
 31


cents.
 This
 equates
 to
 fourth
 quarter


adjusted
 EPS
 of
 approximately
 12
 cents


which
 assumes
 a
 Q4
 tax
 rate
 of


approximately
 10%.
 We
 now
 expect
 growth


in
 tangible
 book
 value
 of
 approximately


$2.5
 billion
 for
 the
 year
 above
 our


prior
 guidance
 of
 around
 $640
 million.


We've
 had
 a
 great
 year
 thus
 far
 and
 look


forward
 to
 a
 strong
 finish.
 Let's
 now


begin
 the
 Q&A.


At
 this
 time,
 I'd
 like
 to
 remind


everyone
 in
 order
 to
 ask


>> All
 right,
 questions.


Q&A.
 Here
 we
 go.


>> Question
 per
 person
 at
 a
 time.
 Please


rejoin
 the
 queue
 for
 any
 additional


questions.
 Our
 first
 question
 comes
 from


the
 line
 of
 Dan
 Dolvo.
 Dan,
 please
 go


ahead.
 Your
 line
 is
 open.


>> Hey,
 uh,
 Chris
 Anthony.
 Uh,
 amazing
 job.


Uh,
 very,
 very,
 uh,
 proud
 of
 you
 guys.


um
 wanted
 to
 know
 I
 mean
 the
 question


we're
 getting
 from
 investors
 um
 for
 the


past
 like
 month
 or
 so
 is
 consumer
 credit


I
 mean
 you
 guys
 have
 done
 incredibly


well
 uh
 looking
 at
 NOS's
 coming
 down
 but


can
 you
 give
 us
 an
 overview
 of
 you
 know


what's
 going
 on
 maybe
 there's
 a
 FICO


sort
 of
 differentiated
 thing
 here
 that


helps
 soy
 just
 maybe
 an
 overall
 view
 of


like
 how
 the
 health
 of
 the
 consumer


credit
 across
 the
 different
 uh
 FICO


trenches
 would
 be
 great
 and
 congrats


again


>> sure
 thank
 you
 Dan
 um
 the
 First
 message


is
 our
 credit
 is
 performing
 very
 well.


We
 have
 very
 strong
 uh
 performance
 by


our
 members
 across
 each
 of
 the
 products.


Not
 just
 the
 performance
 of
 credit
 but


the
 spending
 that
 we
 see
 in
 SoFi
 money,


the
 engagement
 that
 we
 see
 in
 SoFi


invest
 uh and
 general
 behavior
 overall.


Um
 we've
 been
 in
 the
 lending
 business


for
 a
 pretty
 long
 period
 of
 time.
 When
 I


joined
 in
 2018,


one
 of
 our
 key
 priorities
 was
 focused
 on


quality
 of
 our
 loans
 over
 quantity
 and


to
 make
 sure
 that
 those
 loans
 were


durable
 through
 an
 economic
 cycle
 and


through
 an
 interest
 rate
 cycle
 and
 any


liquidity
 dislocations.
 Um,
 and
 so
 we're


constantly
 making
 changes
 to
 what


marketing
 channels
 we're
 in,
 the


trade-off
 between
 pricing
 and
 credit


approvals,
 um,
 the
 unit
 economics
 of
 a


loan.
 We
 focus
 on
 having
 a
 40
 to
 50%


variable
 profit
 margin
 on
 our
 loans.
 Uh


and
 so
 sometimes
 we
 can
 drive
 more


volume,
 sometimes
 we
 can
 drive
 higher


margin.
 Um
 but
 it's
 a
 constant
 data


science
 uh
 opportunity
 for
 us
 to
 perfect


our
 loans.
 And
 the
 strength
 of
 the


consumer
 loans
 performance
 speaks
 for


itself.
 It's
 in
 the
 numbers.
 You
 can
 see


our
 net
 charge
 offs
 declined,
 i.e.


improved
 uh
 versus
 last
 quarter.
 Uh
 if


you
 go
 back
 over
 the
 last
 couple
 of


years,
 you'll
 see
 that
 we
 made
 a
 lot
 of


credit
 changes
 to
 ensure
 the
 performance


stayed
 high
 quality
 um
 when
 we
 went


through
 a
 500
 basis
 point
 interest


increase
 and
 now
 we're
 seeing
 rates
 come


down.
 So
 um
 we're
 seeing
 really
 strong


uh
 trends
 in
 the
 channels
 and
 great


demand
 from
 highquality
 borrowers
 and
 we


feel
 really
 confident
 if
 anything


changes
 we'll
 make
 the
 adjustments


accordingly.
 to
 remind
 everyone,
 we


focus
 on
 a
 lifelong
 loss
 between
 seven


and
 8%
 and
 all
 indications
 are
 that


we're
 we're
 below
 that
 as
 Chris
 has


mentioned
 in
 the
 past.


>> Yeah.
 And
 the
 only
 other
 thing
 I
 would


add
 to
 Anony's
 points
 is
 that
 we're
 also


seeing
 really
 good
 demand
 from
 capital


markets
 partners
 uh
 which
 we
 view
 as
 as


a
 flight
 to
 quality.
 So
 all
 in
 all,
 we


we
 remain
 vigilant
 as
 always,
 but
 our


balance
 sheet
 is
 is
 strong
 with
 high


quality
 loans,
 excess
 capital,
 and
 solid


liquidity.
 and
 our
 partners
 are
 active


and
 looking
 to
 expand
 their


relationships
 with
 us
 and
 that's
 a
 true


testament
 to
 the
 credit
 that
 we're


underwriting.


>> The
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 John
 Hec


from
 Jeff.
 John,
 please
 go
 ahead.
 Your


line
 is
 open.


>> John,
 you
 may
 be
 on
 mute.
 John,


>> sorry
 guys,
 apologize.
 technical


difficulties,
 but
 uh
 congratulations
 on


a
 good
 quarter
 and
 thanks
 for
 taking
 my


questions.
 Um
 I
 I
 guess
 my
 my
 question


is
 predominantly
 around
 the
 rate


environment,
 you
 know,
 decreasing
 rates


if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 forward
 curve.


I'm
 wondering
 if
 you
 guys
 could
 talk


about
 how
 the
 the
 lower
 rate
 environment


will
 affect
 the
 volume
 mix
 uh
 on
 the


lending
 side
 and
 particularly
 you
 know


at
 what
 point
 do
 you
 think
 there
 could


be
 a
 pretty
 big
 spike
 in
 student
 loan


refinance
 activity
 and
 then
 second
 and


related
 is
 maybe
 talk
 about
 what
 you


guys
 expect
 in
 terms
 of
 deposit
 uh


debata
 and
 what
 that
 means
 for
 NIM
 over


the
 next
 few
 quarters.


>> Thank
 you
 John.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 we've
 said


this
 in
 the
 past.
 Um,
 our
 business
 is


diverse,
 not
 because
 we
 woke
 up
 and
 said


we
 should
 make
 our
 business
 diverse,
 but


because
 of
 our
 strategy
 of
 being
 a


one-stop
 shop.
 We've
 scaled
 our


businesses
 across
 the
 portfolio
 of


products
 that
 we
 offer
 being
 a
 one-stop


shop.
 Uh,
 to
 a
 level
 that
 in


environments,
 we
 can
 drive
 different


businesses
 based
 on
 the
 characteristics


of
 that
 environment.
 When
 rates
 were


high,
 we
 took
 a
 specific
 strategy.
 As


rates
 are
 coming
 down,
 we're
 taking
 an


alternative
 strategy
 and
 it's
 working.


If
 rates
 stay
 exactly
 where
 they
 are,
 I


think
 our
 business
 continues
 to
 operate


incredibly
 well.
 I
 couldn't
 be
 more


optimistic
 about
 our
 near-term
 trends


and
 what
 we'll
 do
 in
 2026
 relative
 to


our
 our
 prior
 long-term
 guidance.
 So,
 I


feel
 great
 about
 the
 environment
 we're


in
 right
 now.
 I
 do
 I
 do
 worry
 about


things
 like
 credit.
 I
 do
 worry
 about


things
 like
 um
 you
 know,
 height


heightened
 inflation.
 Um
 we
 look
 at


asset
 flows,
 etc.,
 etc.
 So,
 it's
 not


like
 we're
 not
 worried
 about
 things.
 We


just
 feel
 really
 good
 about
 the
 positive


things
 versus
 the
 things
 that
 could


cause
 a
 problem.
 As
 rates
 come
 down,
 I


think
 our
 business
 only
 gets
 better.
 If


we
 stay
 with
 unemployment
 below
 five
 to


5
 and
 a
 half%
 um
 and
 inflation's
 at
 3%,


I
 think
 we're
 in
 a
 really
 great


environment.
 I'm
 not
 a
 student
 of


believing
 inflation
 should
 be
 2%.
 I


think
 3%
 is
 perfectly
 fine.
 Um
 I
 think


we
 have
 global
 stability
 that
 will
 also


be
 important.
 Um
 I
 think
 about
 things


that
 could
 disrupt
 us
 as
 one
 economic


i.e.
 unemployment
 uh
 two
 financial


liquidity
 rates
 are
 coming
 down
 not


going
 up
 and
 then
 three
 is
 the


macroeconomic
 factors
 that
 are
 out
 of


our
 control
 and
 exogenous
 events.
 Um
 as


rates
 go
 down
 our
 student
 loan
 business


will
 benefit
 meaningfully.
 Rates
 have


been
 very
 high
 for
 the
 last
 three
 years.


Federal
 student
 rates
 are
 high
 and
 we


can
 give
 them
 a
 significant
 savings
 on
 a


$70,000
 balance.
 So
 we'll
 benefit
 from


lower
 rates
 in
 student
 loan
 refinancing.


Uh
 for
 sure
 the
 the
 home
 equity
 market,


the
 home
 loan
 market,
 the
 real
 estate


market
 more
 broadly
 will
 benefit
 from


lower
 rates
 both
 in
 refinancing
 as
 well


as
 purchase.
 Um
 as
 relates
 to


refinancing,
 less
 than
 5%
 of
 our
 members


that
 have
 mortgages
 have
 them
 with
 us.


So,
 if
 you
 take
 everyone
 that's
 on
 our


platform
 that's
 using
 SoFi
 and
 you
 look


at
 the
 number
 of
 those
 people
 that
 have


home
 loans
 or
 mortgages,
 only
 5%
 of


those
 with
 mortgages
 are
 with
 us.
 It's
 a


huge
 opportunity
 for
 us
 to
 market
 lower


cost
 of
 a
 mortgage
 to
 them.
 And
 we
 have


the
 technology
 to
 know
 where
 their
 rates


are,
 to
 deliver
 personalized
 messages
 to


them,
 and
 we've
 built
 the
 backend
 and


operational
 capabilities
 to
 deliver
 a


reliable
 mortgage
 in
 a
 specific
 uh


period
 of
 time.
 So,
 we
 feel
 really
 great


about
 that.
 As
 it
 relates
 to
 SoFi
 money,


I've
 said
 this
 in
 the
 past,
 I'll
 say
 it


again.
 It's
 starting
 to
 show
 itself
 now.


In
 a
 high
 rate
 environment,
 non-banks


can
 compete
 with
 us
 on
 interest
 rate.


Many
 choose
 not
 to
 because
 they're


trying
 to
 make
 more
 money
 with
 NIM,
 but


it's
 easy
 when
 rates
 are
 high
 when
 Fed


funds
 are
 high.
 When
 Fed
 funds
 is
 low,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 hard
 for


non-bank
 and
 non-
 lending
 companies
 to


compete
 with
 us.
 Our
 competitive


advantage
 will
 come
 through
 and
 show
 the


world
 that
 we
 have
 the
 highest
 lifetime


value
 and
 a
 broad-based
 PL
 uh
 portfolio


of
 products
 allows
 us
 to
 give
 a
 superior


yield
 when
 others
 are
 struggling
 to


provide
 that
 yield
 because
 of
 the
 fact


that
 we
 have
 both
 lending
 and
 we're


insured
 deposit
 institution
 and
 we
 have


a
 broad-based
 membership
 that
 we
 can


market
 to
 efficiently
 for
 Crossby.
 In


the
 most
 recent
 quarter,
 40%
 of
 our


product
 growth
 came
 from
 Crossby.
 That's


with
 our
 members
 growing
 35%.


Chris,
 would
 you
 add
 anything?


>> Yeah,
 the
 only
 other
 thing
 I
 would
 add,


um,
 John,
 to
 your
 your
 comments
 on


deposit
 betas
 and
 and
 NIM
 over
 the
 next


few
 quarters,
 we've
 been
 really


successful
 in
 maintaining
 healthy
 NIM


margins.
 Uh,
 this
 past
 quarter,
 we
 were


at
 5.84%.


Maintaining
 these
 strong
 margins
 has


been
 a
 function
 of
 the
 loan
 pricing


betas
 that
 we
 have
 as
 well
 as
 obviously


our
 cost
 of
 funds.
 What
 we've


demonstrated
 on
 the
 loan
 pricing
 betas


uh
 front
 is
 in
 uh
 rising
 rate


environments,
 we've
 been
 able
 to
 outpace


rates
 and
 and
 maintain
 really
 strong


pricing.
 In
 down
 rate
 environments,


we've
 been
 able
 to
 maintain
 solid


pricing
 um
 above
 where
 rates
 have
 gone.


And
 then
 from
 an
 asset
 yield


perspective,
 um
 we've
 been
 able
 to


maintain
 strong
 asset
 yields
 and
 reduce


our
 overall
 cost
 of
 deposits
 all
 while


maintaining
 healthy
 growth
 in
 member


deposits
 last
 quarter.
 Historically,


we've
 been
 at
 about
 a
 65
 to
 70%
 uh


deposit
 beta.
 We
 would
 expect
 that
 to


continue
 going
 forward.


>> The
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 Kyle
 Joseph


from
 Stevens.
 Kyle,
 please
 go
 ahead.


Your
 line
 is
 open.


>> Hey,
 uh
 good
 morning
 guys.
 Thanks
 for


taking
 my
 question.
 Um
 just
 uh
 just


wanted
 to
 get
 your
 thoughts
 on
 the


competitive
 environment.
 Obviously,
 we


saw
 your
 guidance
 for
 membership
 growth


go
 up,
 which
 is
 obviously
 a
 positive.


you
 know,
 is
 that
 a
 function
 of
 just
 in


kind
 of
 internal
 marketing
 efforts
 and


brand
 awareness
 or,
 you
 know,
 can
 we


step
 back
 and
 think
 about
 things


potentially
 getting
 less
 competitive
 out


there?
 I
 think
 you
 talked
 about
 capital


providers
 and
 and
 the
 flight
 to
 quality


you're
 seeing.
 So,
 just
 want
 to
 get
 your


commentary
 there.


>> Um,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 function
 of
 many


factors.
 First,
 unated
 brand
 awareness.


Our
 goal
 is
 to
 drive
 unated
 brand


awareness
 higher.
 It
 provides


productivity
 across
 our
 digital


marketing
 capabilities
 and
 performance


marketing.
 And
 so
 uh
 we
 talked
 about
 the


9.1%
 unated
 brand
 awareness
 that
 we


achieved
 in
 in
 uh
 Q3.
 Uh
 that
 we
 expect


to
 continue
 into
 Q4.
 Uh
 we
 have
 a
 number


of
 new
 product
 launches
 that
 will
 also


contribute
 that
 will
 not
 just
 contribute


directly
 um
 because
 there
 are
 new


products
 but
 they'll
 also
 contribute


indirectly
 and
 that
 they're
 raising


awareness
 that
 we're
 a
 one-stop
 shop.
 Um


specifically
 our
 goal
 is
 to
 launch
 buy,


sell,
 and
 hold
 crypto
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.
 um
 will
 cachina
 roll
 out
 SoFi
 pay


uh
 to
 other
 international
 markets.
 And


so
 the
 second
 bucket
 is
 is
 new
 products.


And
 then
 the
 third
 um
 we
 have
 a
 pretty


good
 understanding
 of
 what
 channels
 to


market
 what
 products
 in
 um
 and
 have
 a


good
 read
 on
 customer
 acquisition
 cost


by
 channel.
 Um
 and
 so
 we're
 just


ensuring
 that
 we
 continue
 to
 add
 more


marketing
 at
 an
 efficient
 rate
 uh


focused
 on
 you
 know
 profitability
 and


growth.
 And
 it's
 our
 confidence
 in
 being


able
 to
 do
 that
 uh
 in
 a
 bigger
 way
 in
 Q4


than
 we
 did
 in
 Q3.
 Um
 in
 addition
 to
 the


the
 new
 product
 uh
 launches
 that
 we'll


have
 and
 the
 benefit
 from
 any
 brand


awareness.
 So
 that's
 driving
 our


confidence.
 Uh
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 our
 goal


is
 to
 continue
 to
 move
 along
 a
 linear


curve
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we're
 not
 um


falling
 off
 that
 efficient
 frontier
 of


marketing
 and
 brand
 awareness
 and


spending.
 Um
 but
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 upside


from
 spending
 at
 efficient
 rates
 if
 we


chose
 to
 grow
 even
 faster.


The
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 Andrew


Jeffrey
 at
 William
 Blair.
 Andrew,
 please


go
 ahead.
 Your
 line
 is
 open.


>> Thank
 you.
 Uh,
 appreciate
 you
 taking
 the


question
 this
 morning.
 Um,
 Anthony,
 as


you
 see
 faster
 growth
 in
 the


non-personal
 loans
 business,
 which
 I


think
 is
 really
 encouraging
 from
 a


diversification
 standpoint,
 does
 that


change
 your
 thought
 on
 how
 you
 fund
 that


growth
 on
 balance
 sheet?
 um
 you
 know


deposit
 driven
 versus
 the
 loan
 platform


business
 and
 are
 there
 opportunities
 in


the
 loan
 platform
 business
 for


non-personal
 loan?
 I'm
 just
 trying
 to


think
 about
 what
 the
 funding
 mix
 looks


like
 as
 the
 origination
 mix
 shifts
 a


little
 bit.


>> Sure.
 There
 are
 definitely
 opportunities


in
 the
 loan
 platform
 business
 from


non-personal
 loans
 and
 Chris
 and
 the


capital
 markets
 team
 is
 working
 on
 that.


Um,
 you
 know,
 funding
 off
 of
 deposits
 is


definitely
 uh
 a
 element
 that
 drives
 our


durability
 and
 our
 confidence
 in


lending.
 Um,
 the
 dependency
 on
 deposits


will
 likely
 uh
 reduce
 over
 time
 and
 our


cost
 of
 funds
 will
 also
 likely
 come
 down


over
 time
 based
 on
 a
 bunch
 of
 decisions


that
 that
 we
 we
 make
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 uh


how
 to
 spend
 our
 capital.
 Um,
 I
 do
 think


you'll
 continue
 to
 see
 us
 drive
 revenue


streams
 that
 are
 not
 connected
 to


capital.
 um
 you
 know
 56%
 of
 our
 revenue


is
 now
 coming
 from
 our
 tech
 platform
 and


financial
 services
 business
 um
 and


that's
 up
 pretty
 meaningfully
 over
 time


and
 you
 can
 see
 the
 benefit
 to
 our


profitability
 line
 and
 our
 roe
 and
 our


tangible
 book
 value
 growth
 uh
 related
 to


that.
 So
 uh
 there's
 a
 number
 of


initiatives
 that
 we
 have
 that
 we
 haven't


talked
 about
 publicly
 that
 will
 also


help
 as
 we
 leverage
 blockchain


technologies
 uh
 in
 the
 lending
 space


specifically
 that
 will
 help
 drive
 uh


strong
 uh
 you
 know
 diversification
 of


funding
 uh
 for
 our
 balance
 sheet.


>> Next
 question
 comes
 from
 Kyle
 Peterson


at
 Needam
 and
 Co.
 Kyle,
 please
 go
 ahead.


Your
 line
 is
 open.


>> Uh
 great.
 Uh
 good
 morning.
 Thanks
 for


taking
 the
 question
 and
 uh
 nice
 results.


Uh
 wanted
 to
 drill
 down
 into
 the
 loan


platform
 business
 in
 particular.
 Uh
 I


know
 there
 was
 at
 least
 another
 fintech


lender
 that
 kind
 of
 recently
 said
 that


at
 least
 some
 of
 the
 the
 loan,
 you
 know,


buyers
 and
 and
 such
 on
 um
 from


institutional
 investors
 were
 kind
 of


consolidating


uh
 purchases
 to
 kind
 of
 fewer
 platforms.


I
 guess
 was
 the
 strength
 this
 quarter?


Was
 it
 broad-based
 in
 terms
 of
 you
 guys


adding
 uh
 you
 know
 participants
 on
 on


the
 platform
 on
 the
 on
 the
 funding
 side


or
 or
 was
 it
 you
 know
 fairly


concentrated
 with
 existing
 partners
 just


any
 color
 there
 and
 if
 you
 guys
 are


seeing
 anything
 uh
 similar
 uh
 would
 be


really
 helpful.
 Thank
 you.


>> Yeah,
 thanks
 Kyle.
 Um
 so
 we
 saw
 growth


growth
 across
 both
 um
 new
 partners
 as


well
 as
 existing
 partners
 who
 who
 have


partnerships
 with
 us.
 Um
 what
 we


actually
 saw
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 flight
 to


quality
 where
 existing
 partner
 a
 number


of
 existing
 partners
 came
 to
 us
 and


asked
 to
 upsize
 um
 their
 commitments
 not


only
 in
 Q3
 but
 Q4.
 So
 we
 expect


continued
 momentum
 to
 occur
 in
 in
 the


last
 quarter
 of
 the
 year.
 Um
 and
 then
 we


also
 saw
 some
 growth
 in
 in
 new
 partners


as
 well
 as
 expanded
 credit.
 So
 net
 net


it
 was
 growth
 across
 the
 board.


>> The
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 Reggie


Smith
 at
 JP
 Morgan.
 Reggie,
 please
 go


ahead.
 Your
 line
 is
 open.


>> Hey
 guys,
 uh
 great
 quarter.
 Um
 I
 guess
 I


had
 to
 follow
 up
 on
 on
 the
 loan
 platform


business
 as
 well.
 Um,
 is
 there
 a
 way
 to


kind
 of
 frame
 the
 numbers
 the
 number
 of


uh
 of
 buyers
 on
 the
 platform
 and
 and


kind
 of
 what
 your
 next
 four
 quarter


capacity
 looks
 like?
 Um,
 and
 then
 also


talk
 about
 the
 process.
 I
 think
 you


mentioned
 this
 Samuel
 Chris
 about,
 you


know,
 how
 companies
 upsize
 uh
 their


commitments.


cut
 out
 there
 at
 the
 end
 um
 Reggie,
 but


I
 think
 you
 asked
 about
 the
 process
 for


how
 companies
 upsize
 their
 commitments.


In
 terms
 of
 your
 first
 question
 about


the
 number
 of
 buyers
 on
 the
 platform
 and


what
 the
 next
 quarter's
 capacity
 looks


like,
 um
 we
 aren't
 going
 to
 disclose
 the


number
 of
 buyers
 that
 we
 have.
 We
 have


disclosed
 a
 few
 publicly
 um
 with


Fortress
 and
 Blue
 Owl.
 Um
 but
 we
 have
 a


number
 of
 partners
 on
 the
 platform.
 Uh


what
 capacity
 looks
 like
 next
 quarter,


we
 did
 $3.4
 4
 billion
 of
 originations
 on


behalf
 of
 others
 this
 past
 quarter
 and


Q3.
 We
 expect
 that
 to
 um
 to
 continue
 to


grow
 heading
 into
 Q4.
 In
 terms
 of
 how


companies
 upsize
 their
 commitments,
 um


they
 typically
 come
 to
 us
 intraquarter.


Um
 if
 they
 have
 excess
 capac
 capacity
 or


demand
 for
 incremental
 loans
 um
 and
 if


we're
 able
 to
 fulfill
 um
 by
 the
 end
 of


the
 quarter,
 we'll
 we'll
 do
 so.
 and
 the


behavior
 we're
 seeing
 of
 consolidation


down
 to
 higher
 quality.
 Um,
 we're


definitely
 that
 you
 mentioned,
 we
 think


we're
 benefiting
 from
 that
 based
 on
 the


activity
 we've
 seen
 from
 those
 partners.


>> The
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 Peter


Christensen
 from
 Croup.
 Peter,
 please
 go


ahead.
 Your
 line
 is
 open.


>> Thank
 you.
 Good
 morning.
 Thanks
 for
 the


question
 and
 uh
 nice
 trends
 here
 for


sure.
 Um,
 Anthony,
 I
 just
 wonder
 can
 you


remind
 us
 where
 we
 are
 in
 your


investment
 cycle
 perhaps
 not
 just
 like


the
 marketing
 and
 performance
 marketing


branding
 those
 sorts
 of
 things
 but
 maybe


more
 so
 in
 capabilities.
 I
 know
 I
 know


you're
 uh
 going
 to
 be
 onboarding
 some


some
 new
 clients
 in
 on
 the
 tech
 platform


pretty
 soon
 and
 now
 building
 out
 crypto


whether
 that's
 partnered
 or
 native.
 Just


if
 you
 could
 frame
 for
 us
 where
 we
 are


in
 the
 investment
 cycle.
 Thank
 you.


Yeah,
 I
 would
 I
 would
 like
 to
 invest
 a


lot
 more
 than
 we're
 investing,
 but
 we're


trying
 to
 balance
 both
 growth
 and
 being


responsible
 for
 delivering
 profitability


and
 good
 returns.
 Um,
 we
 don't
 want
 to


go
 after,
 you
 know,
 penniles
 growth.
 And


so,
 the
 the
 the
 gating
 factor
 that
 we've


put
 on
 and
 talked
 about
 publicly
 is
 to


have
 at
 least
 a
 30%
 incremental
 ebida


margin.
 And
 I
 say
 the
 word
 at least


because
 if
 the
 business
 does
 well


relative
 to
 expectations,
 it
 it's
 hard


to
 spend
 back
 in
 a
 quarter.
 Um,
 you


know,
 we
 may
 accelerate
 some
 hiring,
 uh,


but
 that
 really
 doesn't
 impact
 the


near-term
 quarter.
 It
 impacts
 the
 next


quarter.
 And
 we
 have
 hired
 a
 lot
 more


people
 in
 2025
 than
 we
 set
 out
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 year
 because
 we've
 been


driving
 both
 strong
 topline
 growth
 and


really
 strong
 incremental
 profitability.


Um,
 I
 would
 love
 to
 spend
 every
 dollar


we
 could
 down
 to
 that
 30%
 incremental


margin.
 It's
 not
 always
 possible
 to
 do


that.
 Um
 that
 30%
 criminal
 ebida
 margin


will
 be
 the
 standard
 until
 we
 see
 our


growth
 drop
 below
 call
 it
 15%.
 I
 think


as
 long
 as
 we're
 growing
 above
 that
 we


should
 invest
 in
 the
 business
 to
 make


the
 top
 line
 as
 large
 as
 it
 can
 be
 and


then
 over
 time
 um
 we
 can
 slow
 down
 our


spending
 and
 drive
 margin
 expansion.
 But


we're
 definitely
 not
 in
 the
 mode
 of


driving
 driving
 margin
 expansion
 unless


we
 out
 outperform
 compared
 to
 the
 30%


incremental
 evid
 margin.
 Um
 the
 areas


we're
 investing
 is
 we'll
 continue
 to


iterate
 on
 our
 existing
 products.
 We're


focused
 every
 day
 on
 five
 things
 of
 our


existing
 products.
 Fast
 selection,


content,
 and
 convenience
 and
 then
 make


them
 better
 together.
 Um
 there's
 some


products
 that
 are
 new
 that
 we'll


increase
 the
 investment
 in
 such
 as
 SoFi


Plus.
 We're
 really
 pleased
 with
 the


progress
 we've
 made
 there.
 Um
 there
 will


be
 additional
 things
 that
 we
 add
 into


SoFi
 Plus
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 value.
 One
 of


which
 is
 the
 smart
 card.
 We
 think
 it's


the
 best
 of
 any
 card.
 It'll
 have
 high


rewards,
 5%
 on
 food.
 Um,
 it'll
 also
 have


high
 interest
 or
 highest
 APY.
 Um,
 in


addition
 to
 that,
 you
 can
 also
 build


your
 credit
 score
 and
 you'll
 be
 able
 to


use
 that
 relationship
 with
 us
 to


potentially
 borrow
 um
 both
 ahead
 of
 time


and
 and
 post
 transactions.
 And
 that
 will


be
 an
 evolving
 uh
 feature
 set
 after
 we


launch
 that
 will
 continue
 based
 on
 how


we
 learn
 our
 members
 want
 to
 use
 the


product.
 um
 but
 focusing
 on
 the
 smart


things
 that
 they
 want
 and
 making
 that


get
 making
 it
 have
 the
 best
 of


everything.
 Um
 we
 talked
 about
 cash


coach
 on
 the
 call.
 There's
 a
 number
 of


AI
 initiatives
 to
 help
 people
 spend
 less


than
 they
 make
 and
 invest
 the
 rest.
 Um


it
 is
 a
 unique
 formula
 that
 we
 can


deliver
 on
 in
 addition
 to
 the
 investing


piece.
 You
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 things


that's
 interesting
 about
 our
 buy,
 sell,


and
 hold
 for
 crypto
 is
 that
 the
 way


we'll
 launch
 this
 product
 is
 going
 to
 be


pretty
 novel.
 Someone
 will
 open
 up
 a


SoFi
 money
 account
 if
 they
 don't
 have
 a


SoFi
 money
 account.
 They'll
 fund
 that


SoFi
 money
 account
 and
 then
 all
 their


purchases
 are
 drawn
 from
 that
 SoFi
 money


account.
 What's
 the
 benefit
 of
 that?


Well,
 that
 SoFi
 money
 account
 has
 FDIC


insurance
 and
 we've
 added
 additional


insurance
 for
 our
 members
 if
 they
 opt
 in


up
 to
 $2
 million,
 not
 just
 $250,000.


So
 someone
 can
 have
 an
 FDIC
 insured
 uh


bank
 account
 where
 they
 keep
 their
 funds


and
 seamlessly
 be
 able
 to
 buy


cryptocurrency
 and
 the
 money
 moves
 from


one
 entity
 to
 the
 next
 seamlessly
 behind


the
 scenes.
 A
 very
 efficient
 process


that
 I
 think
 will
 be
 very
 differentiated


and
 will
 be
 the
 first
 bank
 to
 offer
 buy,


sell,
 and
 hold
 crypto.
 We've
 mentioned


stable
 coin
 on
 the
 call.
 I
 I
 can
 just


tell
 you
 every
 day
 there's
 a
 new


opportunity
 for
 us
 to
 leverage
 the
 SoFi


USD
 stable
 coin
 that
 we'll
 plan
 to


launch
 and
 we
 have
 some
 unique


advantages
 that
 were
 already
 a
 tier
 one


bank.
 What
 do
 I
 mean
 by
 that?
 Because
 we


are
 tier
 one
 insured
 deposit


institution,
 we
 can
 take
 the
 reserves
 of


our
 stable
 coin
 and
 put
 them
 at
 the
 Fed


and
 earn
 Fed
 funds.
 What
 does
 that
 mean?


Zero
 credit
 risk,
 zero
 liquidity
 risk.


There's
 not
 a
 stable
 coin
 provider
 in


the
 United
 States
 that
 can
 make
 that


claim.
 very
 differentiated,
 super


excited
 about
 it.
 And
 there's
 a
 number


of
 other
 applications
 there.
 You
 can


imagine
 that
 Fed
 funds
 that
 we
 earn
 on


those
 reserves,
 they
 could
 be
 given
 back


to
 the
 consumer.
 They
 could
 be
 given
 to


businesses
 to
 accept
 our
 payment
 at


point
 of
 sale.
 Um,
 and
 it
 can
 provide
 a


lot
 of
 different
 benefits
 to
 other


ecosystem
 partners
 to
 cause
 them
 to
 want


to
 partner
 with
 us
 as
 opposed
 to
 a


non-tier
 one
 nationally
 licensed
 bank.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 invest
 as
 much
 as
 we


can
 to
 that
 30%
 incremental
 evidom


margin
 and
 sustain
 high
 levels
 of
 growth


um
 you
 know
 until
 it
 slows
 down
 and
 then


we'll
 drive
 profitability.


>> The
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 Mosha
 Orin


Buch
 from
 TV
 Securities.
 Your
 line
 is


now
 open.
 Please
 go
 ahead.


>> Great.
 Thanks.
 Um
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit


about
 the
 competitive
 dynamic
 in
 the


personal
 loan
 business.
 saw
 one
 of
 your


uh
 close
 competitors
 got
 acquired
 by
 a


large
 bank.
 Do
 you
 think
 first
 do
 you


think
 that
 makes
 the
 business
 you
 know


uh
 kind
 of
 a
 better
 competitive
 dynamic


if
 that
 happens
 or
 maybe
 just
 talk
 about


that
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 and
 if
 you
 could


also
 just
 address
 you
 know
 you
 talked


about
 becoming
 more
 capital
 light.
 How


much
 of
 that
 do
 you
 think
 comes
 out
 of


the
 personal
 loan
 business
 you
 know
 in


terms
 of
 doing
 less
 for
 your
 balance


sheet
 or
 more
 proportionally
 more
 in
 the


loan
 platform
 side?


In
 terms
 of
 competition
 for
 PL,
 I'd
 say


it's
 generally
 been
 a
 competitive


environment,
 but
 from
 entities
 that
 are


not
 large
 national
 banks
 or
 the
 top
 10


uh
 banks
 in
 our
 country,
 they
 just
 don't


offer
 this
 product.
 I
 think
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 reasons
 for
 why
 they
 don't
 offer


this
 product.
 It's
 it's
 a
 gap
 in
 their


portfolio
 that
 allows
 us
 um
 to
 really


gain,
 I
 think,
 more
 members
 at
 efficient


costs.
 I
 think
 the
 reason
 why
 they


probably
 don't
 offer
 the
 product
 is


because
 they
 gouge
 people
 so
 bad
 on


credit
 cards
 and
 it's
 such
 a
 great
 ROE


product
 um
 that
 they
 don't
 want
 to


cannibalize
 the
 credit
 card.
 The
 way
 you


make
 money
 in
 the
 credit
 card
 business


is
 through
 revolving
 balances.
 Well,


credit
 cards
 average
 in
 the
 United


States
 over
 20%
 interest
 on
 those


revolving
 balances.
 If
 you
 actually
 had


a
 prime
 uh
 member
 or
 super
 prime
 member


and
 told
 them
 they're
 going
 to
 get


charged
 20%,
 they
 wouldn't
 sign
 up
 for


that
 any
 day.
 But
 if
 you
 put
 that
 behind


a
 fancy
 name
 of
 the
 card
 and
 all
 these


benefits
 and
 high
 rewards,
 no
 one
 sees


the
 high
 interest
 rate
 that
 they
 get
 and


they
 chase
 those
 reward
 points
 um


thinking
 they're
 getting
 some
 benefits


from
 it.
 Then
 they
 end
 up
 with
 a
 balance


that
 they
 can't
 pay
 off
 after
 one
 month


and
 then
 they
 said
 they'll
 do
 it
 after


two
 months
 and
 before
 you
 know
 it,
 it's


been
 six
 months.
 They
 now
 have
 a
 $10,000


$15,000
 balance.
 They're
 paying
 20
 to


30%
 interest
 on
 it.
 Would
 you
 refinance


them
 with
 a
 personal
 loan
 at
 12%.


Probably
 not.
 So,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a


product
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 own
 from
 a


leadership
 standpoint
 and
 we'll
 continue


to
 bite
 away
 at
 these
 huge
 balances


where
 people
 are


>> All
 right.
 So,
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 with


SoFi.
 Uh,
 if
 people
 want
 to
 continue


listening
 to
 the
 last
 15
 minutes,
 you


can
 head
 over
 to
 Tanner
 stream.
 Uh,


there's
 the
 results
 right
 there.
 We
 got


a
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 Steve,


after
 listening
 to
 the
 call,
 any


thoughts
 on
 what
 Notto
 said?
 I
 I
 don't


want
 to
 be
 disrespectful.


I'm
 trying
 not
 to
 be
 disrespectful.


Uh


>> oh.


>> Maybe
 maybe


>> whenever
 someone
 starts
 off
 by
 saying
 I


don't
 want
 to
 be
 disrespectful,
 they're


about
 to
 be
 disrespectful.


>> I
 mean,
 maybe
 it's
 because
 it's
 so


early,
 but
 I
 kind
 of
 wanted
 to
 go
 to


sleep.


>> I
 don't
 think
 you're
 alone
 there.
 I


don't
 think
 you're
 alone.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 the
 call
 not
 get


freaking
 enthusiastic.
 I
 He's
 trying
 to


be
 enthusiastic,
 but
 it's
 like
 I
 don't


know.
 He's
 not
 like
 Zuck.


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know.


>> He's
 not
 like
 Jensen.


>> They
 really
 should
 do
 a
 They
 have
 enough


of
 a
 retail
 audience
 where
 a
 video
 call


would
 be
 super
 dope,
 but
 they
 don't.


>> A
 video
 call
 would
 be
 so
 much
 better.


>> Overall,
 I
 mean,
 on
 the
 quarter,
 stocks


up
 about
 3%.
 PayPal
 and
 UNH
 are
 moving
 a


bit
 more.
 So,
 PayPal
 right
 here.
 We'll


talk
 about
 PayPal.
 Now,
 PayPal
 was
 up


15.
 Now,
 it's
 up
 eight.
 I
 don't
 know


what
 they're
 saying
 on
 the
 call,
 but
 it


did
 lose
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 its
 gains.


Then,
 UNH
 right
 here.
 Better
 EPS


guidance.
 That's
 up
 4%
 breaking
 the


380s.
 So,
 congrats
 to
 everyone
 in
 UNH.


Uh
 stock
 was
 at
 230
 not
 too
 long
 ago.
 In


terms
 of
 the
 SoFi
 quarter,
 we
 we
 both


before
 the
 call
 started,
 we
 both
 agreed


it
 was
 a
 phenomenal
 quarter.
 Do
 you


think
 anything
 Notice
 said
 on
 the
 call


changed
 your
 mind
 as
 well?
 So,
 there's


nothing
 he
 could
 say.
 I
 mean,
 said
 all


the
 right
 things.


Stock's
 still
 up,
 thankfully.
 Hopefully,


it
 doesn't
 sell
 off.
 I
 really
 don't
 want


to
 see
 it
 break
 31,
 to
 be
 honest.
 Um,


>> if
 it
 gets
 down
 to
 30
 and
 a
 half,


>> I
 mean,


>> wait,
 why
 don't
 you
 want
 to
 see
 it
 break


31?


>> To
 the
 downside.


>> Oh,
 to
 the
 downside.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Gotcha.


Gotcha.
 Because
 if
 we
 get
 to
 30
 and
 a


half,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 chance
 we
 end


the
 day
 under
 30.


>> Gotcha.


>> Like
 I
 wanted
 to
 keep
 the
 momentum.


>> Gotcha.


Yeah,
 that's
 fair.
 That
 is
 fair.
 So


again,
 these
 are
 the
 SoFi
 earnings
 right


here
 and
 uh
 obviously
 they
 were
 good.


Yes,
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 this
 break
 and


lose
 momentum.
 I
 mean,
 I
 put
 a
 poll
 in


the
 chat
 on
 what
 people
 think.
 67%
 of


you
 guys
 said
 SoFi
 will
 pump.
 Um,
 it
 has


been
 pumping
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 days,


so
 hopefully
 just
 keeps
 this.


>> Can
 you
 bring
 Do
 me
 a
 favor.
 Bring
 up


the
 uh
 thing
 Steve
 is
 just
 mad
 he
 didn't


buy
 at
 6
 from
 911.
 Like


I
 love
 these
 comments.


I
 love


>> Dude,
 you
 didn't
 buy
 early.
 You're
 late


to
 this.


>> I
 didn't
 buy
 early.
 I'm
 freaking
 late


like
 Tanner.
 I
 mean,


go
 look
 at
 my
 Seeking
 Alf
 and
 tell
 me
 I


didn't
 buy
 at
 six.
 Just
 saying.


Yeah,
 it's
 uh


>> it's
 it
 look
 people
 have
 been
 long
 so
 by


for
 a
 while.
 It's
 just
 first
 of
 all
 the


stock
 is
 up
 over
 100%
 this
 year.
 So
 no


one
 can
 complain
 if
 it
 doesn't
 make


>> that
 that's
 like
 a
 mid
 that's
 like


saying
 a
 mid
 didn't
 buy
 Palunteer


freaking
 nine.


>> Yeah.


Yeah.
 It's
 just
 you've
 been
 a
 part
 of


the
 story
 for
 I
 mean
 when
 you're
 when


you're
 part
 of
 the
 story
 for
 a
 long
 time


you're
 able
 to
 criticize
 it
 more
 because


you
 you
 know
 you
 understand
 the
 story.
 I


think
 I've
 earned
 the
 right
 to
 criticize


SoFi
 just
 a
 little
 bit.
 I
 mean,
 I
 was


long
 when
 it
 was
 at
 450
 and
 I
 publicly


put
 out
 articles


with
 a
 bullish
 rating
 at
 $450
 and
 $5.
 I


think
 I've
 earned
 the
 right
 to
 be
 a


little
 critical
 of
 how
 they
 conduct
 a


conference
 call.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 we
 are
 getting
 a
 mic.
 So,
 we


have
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 headlines
 we'll


cover
 in
 a
 second,
 but
 that
 was
 SoFi


earnings.
 Microsoft
 getting
 a
 massive


move
 right
 here.
 Up
 4%.


>> Why?
 I
 don't
 know.
 But
 this
 is
 this
 is


more
 than
 what
 Microsoft
 pumped
 in
 terms


of
 the
 actual
 stock
 price
 in
 Q2
 and
 they


had
 a
 record.


>> They
 don't
 report
 until
 when?


>> Hold
 on.
 We
 got
 it.
 The
 next
 chapter
 of


Microsoft
 OpenAI
 partnership.
 Oh
 boy.


>> Jesus.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 read
 this
 with
 you
 guys.


>> Here
 we
 go.


What
 began
 as
 an
 investment
 in
 a


research
 organization
 has
 grown
 into
 one


of
 the
 most
 successful
 partnerships
 in


our
 industry.
 As
 we
 enter
 the
 next
 phase


of
 this
 partnership,
 we've
 signed
 a
 new


definitive
 agreement
 that
 builds
 on
 our


foundation,
 strengthens
 our
 partnership,


and
 sets
 the
 stage
 for
 long-term


success.
 First,
 Microsoft
 supports
 the


OpenAI
 board
 moving
 forward
 with
 a


formation
 of
 a
 PBC,
 public
 benefit


corporation,
 and
 recapitalization.
 Okay,


so
 moving
 away
 from


>> from
 a
 nonprofit.
 Following
 the


recapitalization,
 Microsoft
 holds
 an


investment
 in
 OpenAI
 group
 PBC
 valued
 at


approximately
 135
 billion.


How
 much
 did
 they
 put
 into
 OpenAI


originally?


>> I
 think
 it
 was
 just
 Azure
 credits,
 bro.


I
 don't
 even
 think
 it
 was
 like


>> Oh
 my
 god.


>> So
 that's
 27%
 135
 divided
 by
 500.
 Uh


because
 500
 is
 the
 current
 valuation.
 On


a
 as
 converted
 diluted
 basis
 inclusive


of
 all
 owners
 excluding
 the
 impact
 of


OpenAI's
 recent
 funding
 rounds,


Microsoft
 held
 a
 32%
 stake.
 So
 they
 gave


up
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that
 stake
 probably


for
 some
 other
 reason


>> but
 still
 135
 billion
 not
 bad.
 The


agreement
 preserves
 key
 elements
 that


have
 fueled
 this
 successful
 partnership


meaning
 opening
 I
 remains
 Microsoft's


frontier
 model
 partner
 and
 Microsoft


continues
 to
 have
 exclusive
 IP
 rights


and
 Azure
 API
 exclusivity
 until
 AGI.


What
 does
 that
 even
 mean?


We
 will
 keep
 giving
 them
 Azure
 or
 have


exclusive
 IP
 rights
 until
 they
 figure


out
 how
 to
 solve
 AI.


Look
 at
 this
 What
 has
 evolved?


Once
 AGI
 is
 declared
 by
 OpenAI,
 that


declaration
 will
 now
 be
 verified
 by
 an


independent
 expert
 panel.


>> You
 know
 what
 Microsoft
 just
 did?
 They


just
 came
 out
 and
 said,
 "All
 you
 idiots


that
 think
 AI
 is
 not
 real
 need
 to
 shut


up."
 That's
 what
 Microsoft
 just
 did.


that
 and
 I
 think
 they
 gave
 themselves
 a


framework
 to
 be
 able
 to
 figure
 out
 when


they
 divest
 from


>> uh
 Microsoft's
 IP
 rights
 for
 both
 models


and
 products
 are
 extended
 through
 2032.


Microsoft's
 IP
 rights
 to
 research


defined
 as
 the
 confidential
 methods
 used


in
 developments
 of
 models
 and
 systems


will
 remain
 under
 either
 expert
 panel


verifies
 AGI
 or
 through
 2030
 whichever


is
 first.
 That
 is
 incredibly


interesting.
 Microsoft's
 IP
 rights
 now


exclude
 OpenAI's
 consumer
 hardware.
 Wow,


OpenAI
 is
 really
 going
 after
 the


consumer
 uh
 iPhone
 competitor,
 I
 guess.


So,
 Microsoft
 doesn't
 have
 access
 to


that.


>> What?


>> Oh,
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 skipping
 ahead.
 Open
 AAI


has
 contracted
 to
 purchase
 an


incremental
 250
 billion
 of
 Azure


services.
 And
 people
 think
 I'm
 crazy


with
 the
 capex
 freaking
 spend.
 This


comes
 after
 contracting
 26
 gigawatts
 of


chips
 from
 Broadcom,
 Nvidia,
 and
 AMD.


The
 capex
 explosion
 is
 in
 full
 swing.


Period.


>> Well,
 so
 no,
 I
 agree
 with
 you,
 but
 also


I
 think
 opening
 eye
 had
 to
 say
 we're


going
 to
 buy
 this.


>> Well,
 obviously


>> I
 mean
 Microsoft
 would
 have
 been
 pretty


pissed
 off,


>> but
 now
 guess
 what?
 This
 comes
 out


before
 earnings,
 right?
 Think
 about


this.
 They
 just
 declared
 the
 next
 shot


after
 Zuckerberg
 dropped
 27
 billion


dollar
 shot
 on
 the
 Louisiana
 data


center.


>> Agreed.


>> What
 the
 hell
 is
 Jasse
 going
 to
 say
 on


this
 earnings
 call
 now?
 Jassee
 is


probably
 like,
 "What
 the
 hell
 do
 I
 even


say?


What
 does
 Alphabet
 say?
 You
 can't
 not


say
 anything."


No,
 this
 is
 so
 bullish
 Microsoft
 because


their
 guidance
 is
 about
 to
 go
 through


the
 roof
 as
 Steve
 says.
 And
 I
 mean
 this


is
 the
 most
 important
 sentence
 to
 be


honest.
 250
 billion
 from
 open.
 Again,


any
 company
 that
 says
 they
 work
 with


OpenAI
 and
 they
 get
 that
 commitment
 even


if
 it's
 not
 real
 money
 right
 now.
 Street


loves
 it.
 Street
 loves
 it.


>> I
 mean,
 this
 is
 I
 hate
 to
 say
 it
 because


I
 don't
 have
 a
 position
 and
 I
 haven't


done
 enough
 due
 diligence,
 but
 this
 is


freaking
 bullish
 everything.
 This
 is


bullish.
 the


cloud.
 I
 mean,
 cloud's
 not
 the
 right


word,
 but
 Nebius,
 Coreweave,
 this
 is


bullish
 them
 at
 some
 point
 because


Microsoft's
 not
 going
 to
 have
 enough


freaking
 demand.
 And
 guess
 or
 enough
 um


cloud
 to
 support
 the
 demand
 and
 guess


who
 this
 bullish
 for?
 AMD
 and
 Nvidia
 and


Broadcom.
 This
 is
 bullish
 for
 the


networkers,
 Cisco
 and
 AET.
 I
 mean,


this
 just
 extended,
 I
 think,
 because
 now


the
 other
 companies
 have
 to
 come
 over


the
 top
 or
 at least
 match
 this
 with


something.


>> Yeah,
 Nebius
 right
 here
 moving


right
 now
 based
 on
 I
 think
 there
 might


be
 a
 Nebus
 headline.
 I
 don't
 see
 it
 yet,


but
 Nebius
 moving
 as
 well
 potentially


based
 on
 this
 Open
 AI
 deal.
 Wow,
 that's


big.
 Microsoft
 owns
 135
 billion
 of


OpenAI,
 which
 will
 probably
 one
 day
 be,


you
 know,
 500
 billion
 as
 OpenAI
 scales


their
 valuation.
 and
 open
 eye
 will
 be


buying
 250
 billion
 of
 Azure.


>> So
 you
 know what
 the
 real
 question
 now


is?
 Forget
 2025.
 2025
 is
 over.
 Here's


the
 real
 question.


If
 we
 don't
 get
 a
 recession
 in
 26,
 are


we
 going
 past
 8,000
 next
 year?


>> That
 is
 a
 good
 question.
 I
 don't


>> That's
 the
 real
 question
 at
 this
 point.


I
 mean,


I
 don't
 know,
 but
 it
 would
 be
 kind
 of


crazy.


>> This
 is
 like


>> the
 problem
 is
 we
 don't
 see
 OpenAI's


numbers,
 but
 this
 is
 crazy.


>> Google
 and
 Amazon
 are
 down
 on
 this


because
 OpenAI


>> of
 course
 they're
 down.


>> Yeah,
 because
 OpenAI
 is
 spending
 some


money.
 Chris,
 good
 morning.


>> Wait,
 can
 you
 go
 back
 to
 the
 Microsoft


thing?
 Did
 Did
 it
 just
 say
 that


Microsoft
 will
 no
 longer
 have
 the
 first


right
 of
 refusal?


>> Uh
 M.
 Yes.


>> What
 does
 that
 mean?


>> Microsoft.


>> Okay.
 So,
 um
 so
 OpenAI
 is
 going
 to
 be


buying
 credits
 from
 Azure,
 but
 right
 now


the
 way
 that
 it
 I
 guess
 the
 deal
 was


structured
 was
 like,
 hey,
 you
 have
 to


buy
 from
 us
 like
 exclusively.
 Um,
 unless


you
 know
 like
 if
 someone
 gives
 you
 a


better
 deal,
 Microsoft
 can
 either
 match


it
 or
 beat
 it
 or
 say,
 you
 know
 what,
 we


we
 can't
 do
 that.
 So,
 you
 can
 go
 to


somebody
 else.
 Now,
 OpenAI
 can
 go
 to


other
 other
 platforms,


which
 is
 interesting.


I
 think
 this
 is
 what
 Sam
 Alman
 want.


wanted
 a
 lot.
 He
 he
 he
 did
 not
 want
 he


did
 not
 want
 to
 be
 in
 a
 monogous


relationship
 with
 Microsoft


>> and
 he
 basically
 gave
 them


>> 27%
 of
 the
 company
 to
 get
 the
 Remember


Microsoft
 was
 supposed
 to
 own
 51%.


>> That's
 true.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 it's
 an
 interesting
 uh


interesting
 development
 around
 it.
 No,
 I


think
 I
 think
 AI
 for
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


multi-
 multi-year
 um
 buildout.
 The
 only


thing
 that
 I
 would
 say
 just
 I
 would
 be


cautious
 of
 is
 if
 euphoria
 gets
 way
 too


high
 way
 too
 quickly,
 there's
 usually
 a


digestion
 period
 where
 things
 have
 to


catch
 up.
 But
 I
 don't
 see
 that
 being
 the


case
 right
 now.
 I
 think
 right
 now
 just


long
 and
 strong
 AI,
 you
 know,
 it's
 not


it's
 not
 going
 anywhere.
 Uh
 UNH,
 that's


why
 I
 pretty
 much
 came
 on.
 Uh
 UNH,


>> well,
 first
 of
 all,
 Chris,
 congrats,


man.
 I
 mean,
 Right.


>> Once
 in
 a
 while
 you
 uh
 you
 know
 you
 you


get
 something
 right.
 Um
 no
 it
 took
 a
 lot


of
 conviction
 to
 be
 in
 UNH
 when
 when
 it


was
 dropping
 into
 the
 200s.
 Man,
 let
 me


tell
 you
 that
 was
 not
 like
 even
 I


remember
 the
 brutal
 the
 chat
 was
 just


brutal,
 bro.
 Your
 chat
 has
 a
 way
 of


either
 giving
 a
 lot
 of
 love
 or
 just


piling
 on
 that
 hate.
 So
 when
 I
 was


talking
 about
 UNH,
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh
 god,


this
 guy
 again
 with
 this
 freaking
 health


insurance
 BS."
 So,
 but
 uh
 but
 but
 that's


beside
 the
 point.
 The
 point
 is
 the


margins
 on
 the
 business
 are
 starting
 to


recover
 and
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 company


itself
 is
 doing
 what
 it's
 supposed
 to
 do


to
 try
 to
 get
 back
 to
 where
 they
 were
 in


terms
 of
 profitability.
 There
 were
 a


couple
 of
 key
 points
 that
 um
 that
 I'm


not
 sure
 the
 market
 either
 glossed
 over


or
 or
 didn't
 want
 to
 focus
 in
 on,
 but


they
 are
 going
 to
 be
 losing
 about,
 you


know,
 according
 to
 their
 guidance,
 about


a
 million
 Medicare
 Advantage
 customers.


Now,
 from
 a
 company
 standpoint,
 like
 if


someone
 gets
 a
 headline
 like
 that,
 it's


like,
 oh
 my
 god,
 what
 do
 you
 mean


they're
 going to
 be
 losing
 like
 a


million
 people?
 Like,
 isn't
 that
 bad
 for


revenue
 growth?
 And
 the
 truth
 is
 it


could,
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 if
 they
 are


some
 of
 the
 sickest
 people
 um
 in
 those


care
 networks,
 they
 could
 be
 dragging


down
 the
 the
 margin
 considerably.
 So,


some
 people
 they
 would
 be
 better
 served


being
 in
 traditional
 Medicare
 rather


than
 being
 in
 Medicare
 Advantage.
 And
 I


think
 uh
 I
 think
 UNH


last
 time
 they
 really
 focused
 on
 growing


their
 Medicare
 Advantage
 customer
 base.


Um,
 but
 they
 they
 ended
 up
 doing
 it
 with


a
 lot
 of
 margin
 contraction.
 So,
 it


didn't
 work
 out
 very
 well
 for
 them.
 So,


you
 know,
 they're
 doing
 the
 exact
 same


thing
 that
 CVS
 did.
 They're
 narrowing


their
 provider
 networks.
 You
 know,


they're
 they're
 being
 a
 little
 bit
 more


focused
 on
 how
 they
 target
 their


Medicare
 Advantage
 population.
 They're


controlling
 their
 costs.
 And,
 you
 know,


UNH
 UNH
 is
 doing
 all
 the
 right
 things
 um


and
 getting
 back
 in
 the
 right
 direction.


and
 shareholder
 value
 is
 going
 to
 come


from
 that
 margin
 recovery.
 Um
 yeah,
 so


from
 from
 the
 call
 itself,
 you
 can
 kind


of
 tell
 that
 the
 business
 is
 starting
 to


get
 realigned
 back
 to
 where
 their
 um


long-term
 historical
 growth
 averages


were
 are
 going
 to
 be
 by
 2027.
 So
 they


they
 did
 confirm
 that
 2026
 was
 going
 to


be
 a
 good
 year
 because
 there
 it's


definitely
 going
 to
 be
 a
 better
 year


than
 2025,
 but
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be


like,
 hey,
 we're
 fully
 recovered
 back
 to


our
 previous
 uh
 business
 operating


metrics.
 Now,
 of
 course,
 you
 guys
 know


the
 market
 is
 forward-looking.
 So


everyone
 right
 now
 is
 like,
 oh,
 wait
 a


second,
 like
 if
 they're
 get
 if
 their


margins
 get
 back
 to
 where
 they
 were
 in


2027,
 that
 means
 that
 the
 valuation


right
 now
 is
 actually
 very
 low,
 right?


So
 that's
 why
 the
 market
 is
 rewarding


them.
 And
 I
 I
 expect
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 um


a
 lot
 of
 uh
 uh
 what
 are
 they
 called?
 Um


analyst
 upgrades
 this
 week.
 It's
 going


to
 be
 all
 the
 And
 this
 is
 where
 I
 hope


in
 the
 chat
 you
 guys,
 dude,
 flame
 these


analysts,
 bro.
 Whenever
 these


come
 up
 with
 these
 price
 targets,
 I
 used


to
 I
 used
 to
 live
 by
 those
 price


targets.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 look.
 This


analyst
 from
 JP
 Morgan
 thinks
 this
 stock


is
 going
 to
 X,
 Y,
 and
 Z,
 and
 I
 should


believe
 them."
 And
 I
 realized,
 no,
 screw


that.
 They
 are
 so
 many
 of
 them
 have


become
 nothing
 but
 price
 target
 chasers.


Have
 you
 guys
 noticed
 that?


>> I
 mean,
 dude,
 yeah,
 there
 there's
 very


few
 analysts
 I
 trust
 on
 the
 street.
 The


rest
 of
 them,
 they
 get
 paid
 to
 put
 out
 a


price
 target
 pretty
 much.


>> It's
 sickening
 to
 me.
 It's
 sickening.


>> Do
 my
 own
 due
 diligence
 and
 come
 up
 on


my
 own
 targets.


>> Dude,
 it's
 so
 sickening
 to
 see
 this.


Like,
 when
 this
 thing
 was
 going
 down,


people
 were
 like,
 "Oh,
 this
 is
 going


190."
 And
 I'm
 looking
 at
 them
 and
 like


I'm
 like
 what
 in
 what
 world
 does
 a
 $190


price
 target
 make
 any
 sense
 with
 this?


>> Now
 the
 same
 analyst
 like
 no
 no
 it's


worth
 300
 now.
 And
 then
 like
 two
 weeks


later
 no
 no
 it's
 it's
 worth
 like
 400


now.


>> How
 can
 you
 have
 such
 a
 wide
 range
 in


your
 price
 targets
 based
 on
 what
 you


know?
 So
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 when


things
 are
 going
 down
 everyone's
 like


downgrade
 downgrade
 downgrade.
 When


things
 are
 going
 upgrade
 upgrade
 upgrade


and
 that's
 that's
 just
 stupid.
 So,
 I


would
 say
 to
 anyone
 from
 an
 investing


standpoint,
 learn
 how
 to
 do
 some
 some,


you
 know,
 some
 of
 your
 own
 work
 and
 and


don't
 rely
 on
 these
 idiots
 in
 their


price
 targets,
 dude.


>> Chris,
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 this
 before
 you


leave.
 Uh,
 and
 and
 Steve,
 your
 take
 on


this
 as
 well.
 Uh,
 Amazon's
 cutting


14,000
 people.
 UPS
 today,
 I
 don't
 know


if
 you
 guys
 saw,
 they're
 cutting
 48,000,


18,000
 corporate,
 30,000
 operational.


Uh,
 and
 the
 S&P
 is
 at
 alltime
 highs.
 So


Chris,
 how
 are
 you
 thinking
 of
 these


layoffs
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 thinking
 of


the
 fact
 that
 the
 China
 tensions
 might


have
 eased
 enough
 for
 the
 S&P
 to
 keep


going
 higher
 even
 with
 those
 layoffs?


>> I
 mean,
 from
 an
 efficiency
 standpoint


and
 from
 a
 profitability
 standpoint,
 if


they
 can
 get
 the
 job
 done
 with
 less


people,
 that
 that's
 more
 shareholder


value,
 right?
 So
 in
 the
 short
 term,
 it's


a
 good
 thing.
 So
 right
 now
 Amazon
 is


saying
 look
 we
 can
 leverage
 probably


some
 AI
 to
 to
 reduce
 down
 redundancy
 at


the
 white
 collar
 level
 and
 maybe
 we


don't
 need
 as
 many
 people
 that
 are
 just


basically
 collecting
 a
 paycheck.
 You


know
 we
 can
 actually
 get
 more
 things


done.
 Like
 look,
 I
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know


about
 you
 guys,
 but
 I've
 worked
 in
 a


corporate
 setting.
 And
 maybe
 maybe
 um


Stephen,
 you
 could
 add
 chime
 into
 this,


but
 I
 would
 say
 out
 of
 10
 people,


there's
 about
 two
 that
 are
 high


performers,
 five
 that
 are
 like,
 you


know,
 good
 workers.
 They
 show
 up
 on


time,
 they
 do
 what
 they're
 supposed
 to


do,
 and
 they
 leave
 on
 time,
 but
 they're


not
 like
 high
 performers.
 They
 don't


like
 go
 above
 and
 beyond.
 And
 then
 the


rest
 are
 just
 literally
 coasting.


They've
 pretty
 much
 said,
 "My
 career
 is


over.
 I'm
 just
 going
 to,
 you
 know,
 just


show
 up.
 Say,
 they
 don't
 even
 show
 up
 on


time
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 and
 they're
 just


warm
 bodies.
 And
 the
 thing
 is,
 a
 lot
 of


companies,
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 get
 rid
 of


the
 warm
 bodies
 because
 they
 don't
 want


to
 lose
 that
 that
 that
 uh
 that
 that


service
 line,
 right?
 So,
 the
 way
 that


like
 employment
 works
 is
 like,
 let's
 say


you
 have
 10
 people
 and
 um
 and
 you
 let's


say
 let
 one
 of
 those
 people
 go.
 A
 lot
 of


times
 you
 have
 to
 go
 back
 to
 the
 CFO
 and


say,
 "Hey,
 listen,
 this
 guy
 left.
 I
 need


to
 hire
 someone
 new."
 Um
 so
 a
 lot
 of


times
 what
 happens
 is
 managers
 they'll


just
 keep
 slackers
 there
 because
 even


though
 they
 don't
 really
 contribute
 a


lot
 when
 let's
 say
 one
 of
 the
 high


performance
 performers
 goes
 on
 vacation


or
 whatever
 these
 people
 provide
 a
 warm


body
 right


but
 but
 re
 realistically
 all
 the
 layoffs


I
 would
 imagine
 is
 is
 it
 is
 it
 is
 it
 AI


related
 or
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 it's
 it's


it's
 not
 healthy
 for
 the
 economy
 is
 what


>> no
 no
 so
 So
 let
 me
 just
 finish
 up
 with


the
 thought.
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 a
 lot
 of


businesses
 they're
 starting
 to
 look
 at


their
 bottom
 lines
 and
 saying
 look
 where


can
 we
 meaningfully
 become
 more


efficient.
 So
 now
 the
 CFOs
 are
 actually


going
 and
 looking
 at
 like
 hey
 wait
 a


second
 you
 have
 a
 team
 of
 10.
 Who's
 who


can
 we
 get
 rid
 of?
 Let's
 become
 more


efficient.
 Okay
 where
 can
 we
 incorporate


more
 AI
 into
 our
 processes
 to
 to


eliminate
 positions?
 And
 so
 now
 a
 lot
 of


employees
 are
 under
 more
 scrutiny
 and


with
 AI
 tools
 it
 becomes
 easier
 just
 to


say
 you
 know
 what
 these
 two
 high


performers
 and
 these
 other
 other
 five


guys
 we
 can
 just
 support
 them
 and
 and


not
 have
 these
 other
 three
 people
 you


know


>> Steve
 your
 thoughts
 on
 these
 I
 mean
 the


the
 the
 other
 point
 of
 this
 question
 is


are
 we
 seeing
 some
 weakness
 in
 the


economy
 or
 is
 it
 more
 Chris's
 point
 that


companies
 just
 need
 to
 be
 more


operationally
 efficient
 with
 these


>> look
 I've
 lived
 through
 the
 sad
 pass
 in


cloud
 computing.
 So
 is
 Chris.
 I've
 seen


departments
 downsize
 through
 efficiency


with
 software.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 we
 are


in
 a
 situation
 where
 it's
 uncharted


territory
 and
 nobody
 actually
 knows
 how


profound
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 be.
 And
 my


speculation
 is
 that
 we
 are
 going
 to
 have


tremendous
 efficiency
 gains
 and
 I
 am


very
 worried
 about
 what
 happens
 over
 the


next
 5
 to
 10
 years.
 I
 know
 some
 people


last
 night
 thought
 I
 was
 being
 a
 little


bit
 too
 paranoid
 and
 thinks
 it's
 more
 20


30
 years
 out.
 The
 rate
 at
 which


technology
 is
 expanding
 is
 like
 nothing


we've
 ever
 seen
 before.
 Moore's
 law
 is


shattered.
 You
 look
 at
 where
 we
 were
 20


years
 ago.
 There
 was
 no
 smartphones.


There
 was
 no
 cloud
 computing.


It
 is
 a
 much
 different
 world
 than
 where


it
 was.
 And
 now
 when
 you
 add
 the
 rate
 of


expansion
 with
 AI
 and
 how
 quickly
 they


can
 develop
 and
 where
 the
 technology
 is


today,


I
 got
 to
 tell
 you,
 I'm
 worried
 about


what
 happens
 to
 unemployment
 over
 the


next
 5
 to
 10
 years.
 It
 I've
 been
 saying


this
 for
 the
 past
 year
 or
 so,
 and
 the


numbers
 show
 it.


>> I'm
 I'm
 concerned
 with
 youth


unemployment
 as
 me
 and
 uh
 Steve
 were


talking
 yesterday.
 Absolutely.
 Because


that's
 the
 first
 thing
 that
 gets


impacted.


>> I
 I
 spoke
 to
 a
 few
 people
 like,
 you


know,
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 like,
 okay,


like
 why
 is
 youth
 unemployment
 taking
 a


hit
 right
 now?
 And
 so
 I
 actually
 got
 two


different
 responses.
 One
 was,
 hey,
 you


know
 what?
 The
 business
 just
 doesn't


need
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 right
 now.
 We
 can


actually
 get
 by
 with
 the
 the
 people
 that


we
 have.
 And
 you
 know,
 we
 we
 just
 don't


want
 to
 take
 on
 the
 additional
 burden
 of


training
 new
 people
 when
 we
 don't
 know


if
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 full-time


job.
 And
 the
 other
 one
 that
 actually
 I'm


I
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 shocked,
 but
 at
 the


same
 time
 they're
 very
 like
 candid
 about


it
 was


these
 newer
 these
 newer
 grads,
 they
 just


don't
 want
 to
 work.
 Like
 they
 don't
 want


to
 put
 in
 the
 time.
 They
 don't
 want
 to


put
 in
 the
 effort.
 They
 don't
 want
 to
 do


anything.
 They're
 just
 glued
 to
 their


phones
 all
 day
 and
 basically
 just


slacking.
 And
 so
 they
 find
 that
 the


quality
 of
 worker
 among
 this
 new


generation
 of
 people
 are
 just
 not
 good.


They've
 been
 they've
 been
 coddled
 by
 the


remote
 work
 from
 home
 with
 all
 the
 crazy


benefits
 that
 they
 have
 they
 they
 got


during
 COVID
 when
 you
 know
 when
 um
 what


is
 that
 thing
 called
 when
 um
 times
 were


good.
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 people
 are
 just


coming
 into
 like
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 one
 of


my
 friends
 who
 works
 in
 HR.
 He's
 like
 I


have
 people
 that
 come
 into
 the
 interview


and
 the
 first
 thing
 out
 of
 their
 mouth


is
 what
 does
 my
 compensation
 look
 like


and
 what
 is
 like
 how
 many
 days
 do
 I
 have


off?
 like
 you
 don't
 start
 the
 interview


with
 asking
 about
 comp
 plans
 like
 I


don't
 know
 I
 don't
 know
 whether
 this


like
 this
 new
 generation
 thing
 but
 you


know
 you
 you
 walk
 in
 there
 and
 you
 know


when
 they're
 asking
 like
 there's
 like


this
 interview
 part
 that
 like
 the
 first


15
 minutes
 they
 go
 over
 everything
 and


then
 they
 ask
 you
 at
 the
 end
 like
 do
 you


have
 any
 questions
 for
 us
 you
 don't


start
 asking
 about
 hey
 when's
 the
 next


when's
 the
 first
 time
 when's
 when
 can
 I


take
 vacation
 like
 the
 minute
 you
 do


that
 like
 you
 just
 like
 as
 a
 at
 a
 as
 an


interviewer
 you're
 just
 like


So
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 very
 entitled
 uh


um
 the
 younger
 generation
 that's
 coming


in
 they
 have
 been
 very
 coddled
 by
 a
 lot


of
 the
 policies
 during
 co
 when
 hiring


was
 a
 lot
 more
 um
 lax
 and
 so
 um
 yeah
 a


lot
 of
 them
 are
 coming
 out
 of
 school


unprepared
 also
 for
 this
 the
 for
 the


work
 environment
 that's
 just
 not
 there.


So
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 youth
 are
 going
 to


have
 to
 retool
 themselves
 into
 what's


actually
 going
 to
 fit
 into
 the
 economy.


So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 You
 have
 you
 guys


heard
 about
 that
 or
 or
 am
 I
 just
 the


only
 one
 that's
 hearing
 that?


>> Well,
 there's
 another


>> there's
 another
 side
 to
 it
 also,
 Chris.


I
 mean,
 think
 about
 what
 the
 traditional


first
 jobs
 for
 te
 teenagers
 are.


Those
 are
 going
 to
 be
 gone
 in
 5
 to
 10


years.
 I
 mean,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 have


people
 stocking
 shelves
 at
 Target
 or


Walmart
 or
 your
 local
 grocery
 store.


Those
 things
 are
 going
 to
 be
 done
 by


humanoid
 robotics.


I
 just
 I'm
 very
 worried
 about
 where
 we


go
 from
 here
 because
 everybody
 starts


somewhere.
 Everybody
 starts
 with
 a


part-time
 job
 in
 high
 school
 or
 a


part-time
 job
 in
 college
 if
 you
 play


three
 sports
 or
 whatever.
 And
 it's
 just


where
 are
 people
 going
 to
 get
 the
 life


skills
 to
 be
 able
 to
 hold
 conversations


with
 people
 and
 sit
 through
 meetings?
 I


just
 I
 get
 very
 worried.


>> Someone
 said
 in
 the
 chat
 like
 I've
 never


interviewed
 people.
 I've
 I've
 I
 was
 a
 I


was
 a
 manager
 for
 quite
 some
 time.
 I've


interviewed
 plenty
 of
 people
 and
 I'll


tell
 you
 during
 during
 2008
 2009
 all
 of


those
 times
 when
 things
 were
 desperate


workers
 used
 to
 come
 in.
 People
 used
 to


come
 in
 and
 they
 were
 very
 cordial.
 It


was
 just
 the
 time
 it
 it
 was
 a
 dog
 eat


dog
 world.
 So
 people
 were
 a
 lot
 more


willing
 to
 put
 like
 put
 effort
 into
 the


job.
 right
 now
 over
 the
 last
 four
 years


we've
 just
 had
 it
 so
 easy
 right
 finding


a
 job
 that
 now
 that
 sense
 of
 entitlement


is
 carried
 into
 the
 hiring
 practices
 but


at
 the
 same
 time
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 people


they're
 going
 to
 sit
 at
 home
 for
 the


next
 6
 to9
 months
 and
 then
 guess
 what's


going
 to
 happen
 their
 attitude
 is
 going


to
 change
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 like
 hey
 what


are
 my
 benefits
 and
 how
 many
 days
 do
 I


have
 off
 to
 hey
 like
 what
 are
 the


opportunities
 that
 I
 can
 have
 for
 career


expansion
 and
 growth
 that's
 what
 you're


supposed
 to
 say
 when
 an
 interview
 comes


interview
 asks
 you
 like
 do
 you
 have
 any


questions
 for
 us
 like
 like
 what
 are
 what


are
 the
 growth
 prospects
 at
 this


organization
 you
 know
 how
 can
 I
 learn


and
 and
 get
 training
 so
 that
 I
 can
 um


expand
 my
 knowledge
 to
 fit
 in
 better
 and


also
 grow
 my
 career
 because
 I
 don't
 want


to
 be
 here
 for
 6
 months
 while
 I
 look
 for


another
 job
 on
 LinkedIn
 that's
 like
 the


biggest
 worry
 about
 most
 employers
 which


is
 they
 get
 trained
 by
 us
 and
 then


another
 company
 picks
 them
 up
 six
 months


a
 year
 later
 and
 now
 I
 have
 to
 waste
 my


time
 and
 train
 another
 person
 for


another
 six
 months.
 So
 these
 are
 these


are
 like
 little
 things
 that
 you'll


learn.
 But
 yeah,
 sorry
 to
 take


>> I
 was
 say
 last
 question
 for
 you
 Chris.


We
 got
 five
 minutes
 till
 the
 market


opens.
 So
 just
 like
 a
 minute
 on
 this,


but
 S&P
 alltime
 highs,
 I
 mean,
 are
 you


bullish?
 Do
 you
 think
 it's
 a
 little
 too


much
 or
 do
 you
 think
 we
 had
 a
 nice
 draw


down?
 Earnings
 are
 coming
 up
 and
 it's


headed
 in
 a
 in
 a
 decent
 direction.


>> Earnings
 are
 earnings
 are
 fine.
 Like


they're
 everyone's
 doing
 well.
 We
 might


see
 some
 volatility
 here
 and
 there,
 but


there's
 so
 many
 catalysts
 on
 the


horizon.
 I
 would
 not
 want
 to
 be
 short.


um
 this
 market
 right
 now.
 You've
 got
 the


resolution
 with
 the
 Trump
 uh
 China
 China


tariff
 situation.
 You've
 got
 like
 uh


what
 is
 that
 thing
 called?
 The


government
 shutdown
 is
 eventually
 going


to
 resolve
 itself,
 right?


>> Tomorrow.


>> Yeah,
 you
 got
 rate
 cuts
 tomorrow.
 You're


going
 to
 get
 a
 rate
 cut
 probably
 in


December
 and
 then
 maybe
 even
 a
 couple
 of


rate
 cuts
 in
 the
 first
 and
 second


quarter
 of
 2026.
 I
 mean,
 do
 you
 really


want
 to
 be
 short
 when
 the
 Fed
 is
 cutting


rates?
 Probably
 not,
 you
 know.
 But
 the


one
 thing
 I
 will
 say
 is
 positioning
 is


going
 to
 be
 very
 important.
 A
 lot
 of


small
 and
 midcap
 companies
 that
 have


been
 overlooked
 over
 the
 last
 couple
 of


years
 because
 of
 higher
 interest
 rates,


they
 might
 start
 catching
 bids
 next


year,
 right?
 So,
 um,
 so
 me
 and
 Steve,
 we


went
 over
 some
 of
 the
 companies
 like


yesterday,
 like
 I
 would
 say
 that
 look


for
 some
 opportunities
 in
 small
 and


midcap
 as
 well,
 you
 know,
 not
 not
 don't


go
 into
 like
 speculative
 pharma,
 but


don't
 also
 ignore
 these
 really
 good


businesses
 that
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 debt
 on


the
 balance
 sheet
 that
 they'll
 be
 able


to
 refinance
 at
 lower
 rates
 and
 then


boost
 their
 bottom
 lines
 because
 that's


where
 earnings
 are
 going
 to
 be.
 And
 a


lot
 of
 these
 companies
 are
 trading
 at,


you
 know,
 valuations
 that
 are
 decade


lows.
 Um,
 so
 you're
 definitely
 going
 to


see
 multiple
 expansion,
 but
 it
 might
 not


be
 in
 the
 in
 the
 the
 MAG
 7
 exclusively


anymore
 where
 you
 actually
 see


opportunities
 outside
 the
 MAG
 7.


>> Yeah.


All
 right.
 I
 love
 it,
 Chris.
 Thank
 you.


Chris's
 Twitter
 I'm
 putting
 right
 here


in
 the
 chat
 and
 we'll
 have
 you
 on
 later


this
 week
 because
 we're
 definitely
 going


to
 need
 your
 analysis
 on
 big
 tech


earnings
 as
 we
 get
 through
 them.


Later,
 Chris.


>> Later,
 Chris.


>> Later,
 Chris.


>> All
 right.
 Um,
 Steve,
 are
 we
 uh
 are
 we


are
 you
 are
 is
 this
 the
 first
 time


you're
 going
 to
 stay
 on
 the
 uh
 the


market
 open
 with
 me?


>> I
 don't
 know
 how
 I'm
 going
 to
 stay
 on


for
 a
 little
 bit.
 I'll
 probably
 go
 at
 10


because
 I
 have
 a
 meeting
 at


>> Even
 Even
 if
 you
 have
 to
 leave
 at
 like


9:40.
 That's
 That's


>> Yeah,
 I
 have a
 meeting
 at
 10.
 And
 um
 I'm


going
 to
 try
 to
 write
 a
 SoFi
 article
 and


I'll
 probably
 go
 live
 a
 little
 later.
 I


pro
 I
 may
 join
 you
 for
 a
 little
 bit
 on


the
 market
 close
 to
 go
 through
 the
 day


with
 you.


>> Cool.


>> If
 you
 want.


>> Cool.


>> All right.
 So,
 we
 got
 four
 minutes
 until


the
 market
 opens.
 Some
 headlines
 before


we
 get
 into
 it.
 First
 of
 all,
 Trump
 is


going
 to
 meet
 Nvidia
 CEO
 Jensen
 Hang


today
 or
 sorry,
 tomorrow.
 This
 was


confirmed.
 This
 will
 be
 right
 before
 the


China
 meeting,
 which
 I
 think
 is
 super


bullish
 because
 hopefully
 Jensen
 says,


"Hey,
 can
 we
 please
 sell
 some
 chips?"


And
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 Nvidia
 is


cracking
 193
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 because


you
 got
 uh
 this
 Trump
 Jensen
 meeting.
 So


that's
 going
 to
 be
 important.
 Also,


Jensen
 is
 going to
 be
 at
 GTC
 today.
 I


will
 be
 live
 at
 12
 p.m.
 Eastern.
 That'll


be
 a
 very
 important
 conference.
 And
 so


we're
 going to
 see
 what
 updates
 Nvidia


has.
 That
 could
 also
 be
 a
 reason
 why


Nvidia
 is
 pumping.
 For
 those
 that
 are


just
 joining,
 Microsoft
 announced
 a


revised
 agreement
 with
 OpenAI.
 Stocks
 up


three
 and a
 half%.
 Uh
 Microsoft
 will
 now


own
 27%
 of
 OpenAI
 and
 OpenAI
 will
 be


paying
 250
 billion
 for
 Azure.
 We
 don't


have
 a
 timeline
 on
 how
 long
 it'll
 take


for
 them
 to
 pay
 them
 that
 money,
 but


their
 contract
 over
 250
 billion.
 That's


going to
 be
 great
 for
 Microsoft's


guidance
 going
 into
 Q4.
 And
 so
 that's


also
 very
 important.
 Uh
 but
 Microsoft


right
 here
 is
 pumping
 up
 three
 and
 a


half%
 right
 now.
 Amcor,
 I
 will
 probably


buy
 the
 dip
 on
 this
 if
 it
 goes
 below
 20


uh
 30.
 Um
 again,
 this
 was
 a
 really
 good


quarter.
 If
 you
 I
 haven't
 listened
 to


the
 call
 yet,
 but
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


actual
 guidance,
 you
 look
 at
 what


they're
 doing
 in
 the
 Poria
 factory
 and


then
 you
 look
 at
 the
 record
 revenues,


everything
 was
 good.
 The
 stock's
 back
 to


where
 it
 was
 last
 Friday.
 It
 got
 up
 to


33
 and
 so
 now
 it's
 back
 at
 30.
 The
 CEO


is
 leaving
 and
 that
 usually
 tends
 to
 get


a
 stock
 to
 sell
 off
 when
 management


leaves.
 But
 from
 the
 actual
 quarter


itself,
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 phenomenal.
 If


we
 do
 go
 below
 30
 because
 my
 average
 is


around
 3050,
 then
 I
 will
 buy
 the
 dip.
 I


don't
 know
 why
 Grab
 is
 up
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 I
 don't
 see
 any
 crazy


partnership.
 We
 do
 have
 earnings
 coming


up.
 You
 might
 be
 getting
 a
 little bit
 of


a
 pump
 right
 there,
 but
 not
 sure
 why


Grab
 is
 moving.
 But
 we
 are
 green.
 S&P


687.
 I
 mean,
 we
 are
 very
 close
 to
 7,000.


And
 you
 know,
 credit
 to
 Steve
 who
 was


calling
 for
 7,000
 at
 4,800.


It
 looks
 like
 there's
 a
 shot
 that
 we
 can


get
 there
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.
 Um
 Richie,
 our
 boy
 from
 RBC
 has


reiterated
 an
 underperform
 on
 Palenteer


and
 he
 has
 a
 price
 target
 of
 45.


>> I
 mean,
 I'm
 not
 even
 that
 crazy.


>> I
 love
 I
 love
 how
 he
 comes
 out
 with


this.
 He
 said,
 "We
 maintain
 our


underperform
 rating
 and
 45
 price
 target.


Uh,
 we
 cannot
 rationalize
 why
 Palanteer


is
 the
 most
 expensive
 name
 in
 software


absent
 a
 substantial
 beat
 and
 raise


quarter
 elevating
 the
 next
 12
 months


growth
 trajectory
 valuation
 seems


unsustainable."


Look,
 the
 like
 he
 can
 make
 that


argument,
 but
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 didn't


put
 the
 price
 target
 at
 like
 90,
 he's
 at


45
 for
 like
 a
 year
 now.
 So,


>> I
 will
 tell
 you
 I
 feel
 like


they
 watched
 the
 Everything
 Money
 video


that
 just
 came
 out
 and
 then
 made
 that
 is


what
 I
 feel
 like.
 So,
 they
 might
 have.


They
 might
 have.


>> All right,
 folks.
 Here
 we
 go.
 20
 seconds


left.
 First
 market
 open
 with
 Mr.
 Steve


>> and
 SoFi
 is
 teetering
 on
 31
 right
 now.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 All
 eyes
 on
 SoFi.
 SoFi
 beat,


triple
 beat,
 top
 and
 bottom
 line.


>> We're
 going
 to
 see
 as
 the
 markets
 open


what
 happens
 to
 SoFi.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Tuesday,


October
 28th.
 The
 stock
 market


is
 now
 open.


>> Dude,
 you're
 ringing
 that
 bell
 for
 a


long
 time.


>> What'
 you
 say?


>> What'
 you
 say?


>> I
 said
 you're
 ringing
 that
 bell
 for
 a


long
 time.
 Yeah,
 I
 needed
 to
 wake
 you
 up


because
 your
 coffee
 wasn't
 enough.
 All


right,
 wake
 your
 ass
 up.
 Here
 we
 go.


SoFi
 3118.
 That's
 up
 3.9%
 on
 the
 day.
 I


think
 it
 can
 hopefully
 hold
 31
 towards


the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 Most
 of
 you
 guys


think
 it'll
 get
 a
 pump
 even.


>> Can
 you
 get
 an
 order
 book
 up
 by
 any


chance


>> on
 my
 phone?
 I
 can
 get
 it
 up.
 Yeah.


>> Uh
 no,
 don't
 don't
 worry
 about


>> I
 don't
 feel
 like
 logging
 into
 my


software.
 I
 just
 have
 Weeble
 up.


>> Yeah,
 we'll
 take
 a
 look
 at
 it
 in
 a


second.
 Robin
 right
 here.
 That's
 up
 1%.


146.88
 crossing
 through
 147.
 Palanteer


189.
 It
 was
 at
 192.
 S&P
 up
 another2%
 on


the
 day.
 68670


on
 the
 S&P
 500.
 AMD
 goes
 down.
 Uh
 AMD


goes
 down.
 So
 that's
 red.
 The
 Qualcomm


from
 yesterday
 also
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 of


a
 headwind.


>> So
 Aid,
 here's
 the
 real
 question.
 If


SoFi
 doesn't
 sell
 off,
 and
 let's
 just


say
 SoFi
 doesn't
 go
 below
 30,
 but
 it


doesn't
 pump
 past
 31,
 it
 stays
 in
 this


range,
 is
 it
 time
 to
 start
 selling


weekly
 calls?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 fair.
 I
 mean,
 if
 it


stays
 between
 27
 and
 32,
 yes,
 I
 think


it's
 candidate
 for
 weekly
 calls.


>> Like,
 it's
 trying
 to
 hold,
 but
 to
 me,


$30.50
 50
 cents
 is
 like
 the
 the
 line


that
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 cross
 and
 it's


trying
 so
 hard
 to
 stay
 above
 it
 right


now.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 I
 agree.
 Ethereum
 right


there,
 that's
 up
 1%.
 Bitcoin,
 that's
 up


1%.
 Apple,
 that's
 up
 just
 a
 little
 bit.


Apple
 did
 get
 to
 alltime
 highs.
 I
 think


it's
 basically
 at
 all
 time
 highs
 right


here
 at
 269.
 Uh
 Apploven,
 that's
 flat.


Circle
 down.
 Pinterest
 is
 down.
 N
 is


down.
 Microsoft
 3.3%.
 Again,
 that's
 a


big
 move
 for
 a
 company
 of
 Microsoft.


>> Go
 back
 to
 SoFi.
 Go
 back
 to
 SoFi.
 It's


going
 to
 crash
 30.


So
 down
 to
 3020.


>> Wow.
 Okay.
 So,
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 Nvidia


is
 trying
 to
 crack
 all-time
 highs.
 Uh


Microsoft,
 by
 the
 way,
 just
 hit
 four


trillion.
 Is
 this
 the
 first
 time
 or
 did


it
 hit
 it
 before?


>> It's
 hit
 it
 before,
 I
 think.


>> Hit
 it
 before.
 Okay.
 So,
 Microsoft
 right


here,
 four
 trillion.
 Apple
 is
 literally,


I
 mean,
 a
 couple
 pennies
 away
 in
 the


share
 price
 from
 moving
 to
 four


trillion.
 Then
 we
 would
 have
 three
 four


trillion
 dollar
 companies.
 Nvidia
 is


$300
 billion
 away
 from
 moving
 to
 5


trillion
 aka
 about
 $10.
 1946.
 SoFi


holding
 30.2.


>> It's
 I
 mean
 there's
 a
 battle
 right
 now


around
 $30.15.


>> Yes,
 there
 is
 a
 battle
 right
 there.


Rockab
 that's
 down
 half
 a
 percent.
 Eli


Liy
 is
 down
 half
 a
 percent.
 Archer
 is


down
 1%.
 GameStop's
 down
 half
 a
 percent.


The
 rare
 earth
 stocks
 from
 yesterday


continuing
 to
 get
 hit.
 Uh,
 Japan,
 by
 the


way,
 signed
 a
 rare
 earth
 deal
 with
 the


United
 States.
 And
 Japan
 said
 they're


going
 to
 buy
 eight
 billion
 dollars
 worth


of
 soybeans.
 So,
 I
 think
 you
 have
 more


demand
 internationally
 for
 rare
 earths,


which
 is
 likely
 why
 the
 domestic


producers
 are
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of


pain.
 The
 Bitcoin
 miners
 are
 all
 green.


IN's
 up
 1%.
 Cipher's
 up
 1%.
 Terowolf,
 I


don't
 know
 if
 they
 had
 earnings,
 guys,


but
 they
 announced
 something
 that


increased
 their
 revenue
 projections,
 and


that's
 why
 that
 stock's
 up
 14%.
 I'll
 get


the
 exact
 numbers,
 but
 uh
 yeah,
 it
 looks


like
 whatever
 they
 announced,
 whether
 it


was
 earnings
 or
 preliminary
 results,


really
 bullish.
 Google
 took
 a
 stake
 in


Terara
 Wolf
 as
 well,
 and
 that's
 why
 that


stock
 is
 green.
 DJT,
 this
 is
 the
 parent


company
 for
 Trump
 Media.
 They
 announced


they
 will
 be
 getting
 into
 prediction


markets.
 They
 announced
 they
 will
 be


getting
 into
 prediction
 markets.
 And
 so,


you
 do
 have
 DJT
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 pump


right
 there.
 Up
 1.745%.


Nvidia
 is
 that
 all-time
 highs?
 Oh,
 wow.


No.
 19562.


19562
 to
 break
 all-time
 highs


for
 Nvidia.
 Uh,
 Wolf,
 they
 are


developing
 and
 operating
 a
 data
 center


in
 Texas.
 Terble
 owns
 50%
 of
 the
 of
 the


venture.
 Yeah,
 and
 they
 also
 had
 some


revenue
 guidance
 projections
 that
 they


gave,
 which
 was
 bullish.
 Amcor,
 I'm
 not


sure
 why
 this
 one's
 getting
 hit
 8%.


Again,
 it's
 going
 back
 to
 the
 same
 price


it
 was
 on
 Friday.
 So,
 you're
 just
 giving


back
 a
 bit
 of
 what
 it
 had
 from
 last


week.
 But
 again,
 the
 CEO
 leaving
 is


probably
 the
 reason
 why
 you
 have
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 decline.
 CCJ
 Camo,
 this


one's
 up
 17%.


This
 is
 uranium
 44
 billion.
 I
 think
 we


had
 some
 nuclear
 headlines
 yesterday,


which
 is
 why
 that's
 helping
 CCJ.


Um,
 oh,
 here
 it
 is.
 Today
 they
 announced


that
 it
 along
 with
 Brookfield
 Asset


Management
 they've
 entered
 into
 a


binding
 term
 sheet
 with
 the
 US


Department
 of
 Commerce
 to
 establish
 a


strategic
 partnership
 which
 is
 expected


to
 accelerate
 the
 global
 deployment
 of


Westinghouse
 Electric
 Company's
 nuclear


reactor
 technologies
 and
 reinvigorate


supply
 chains
 and
 the
 nuclear
 power


industrial
 base
 in
 the
 US
 and
 abroad.


This
 should
 be
 bullish
 for
 Oakllo
 and
 a


lot
 of
 those
 other
 companies.
 Oaklo
 red


so
 not
 really
 getting
 any
 of
 the
 love


and
 nanuclear
 basically
 flat.
 CCJ


is
 the
 one
 that's
 benefiting.


Um,
 so
 there
 you
 go.
 BMR,
 where
 is
 BMR


right
 there?
 5313.
 That
 is
 flat.


Ethereum
 as
 well,
 4138.
 That
 is
 slightly


above
 4,000,
 but
 still
 relatively
 flat.


Palenteer
 goes
 flat.
 Tesla
 goes
 flat.


Hood
 potentially
 is
 about
 to
 go
 flat.


Nvidia
 is
 really
 the
 only
 one
 that's


making
 a
 big
 move.
 Again,
 we
 have
 GTC,


so
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 trading


that.
 SoFi
 holding
 30.40,
 which
 is
 nice


to
 see
 that
 SoFi
 is
 at least
 holding
 the


30s.
 Grab
 right
 there
 went
 from
 620
 to


617.
 Again,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see


what
 earnings
 put
 up
 for
 Grab.
 Google


right
 here
 269,
 just
 below
 270.
 Amazon,


again,
 14,000
 people
 in
 corporate.


They're
 planning
 to
 lay
 off.
 The
 thing
 I


think
 people
 missed
 about
 Amazon


yesterday
 is
 they're
 not
 planning
 to
 lay


off
 any
 factory
 workers.
 In
 fact,


they're
 planning
 to
 hire
 250,000
 for
 the


holiday
 season.
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 a


corporate
 bureaucratic
 management
 change


particularly
 or
 likely
 led
 because
 of


AI.
 Same
 thing
 that
 UPS
 said
 today.


Although
 UPS
 is
 firing
 30,000


operational
 staff,
 so
 you
 do
 have
 more


uh
 actual
 workers
 getting
 fired.
 But
 it


seems
 like
 their
 operating
 margin


guidance
 should
 be
 bullish
 for
 2026
 if


they're
 getting
 rid
 of
 managers
 that
 are


making
 $300,000
 a
 year
 and
 you
 know


might
 not
 be
 contributing
 as
 much
 as


Amazon
 thinks
 to
 the
 business
 and
 they


can
 be
 replaced
 by
 AI.
 But
 that
 stock's


down
 a
 little bit
 probably
 based
 on
 that


Microsoft
 news
 as
 well.
 And
 that
 is
 what


we
 got.


Uh
 Steve,
 you
 think
 we
 lose
 30?


>> We
 did
 for
 about
 a
 millisecond.


>> Oh,
 you're
 right.
 2987.
 We
 did.


UNH
 went
 red,
 too.
 UNH.


Damn,
 dude.
 Every
 Oh,
 where
 is
 PayPal?


Is
 PayPal
 holding
 its
 pump?


I
 mean,
 PayPal's
 8%
 is
 not
 barely


holding
 it,
 but
 it
 was
 up
 15%.


So,
 you
 do
 have
 PayPal
 losing
 a
 little


bit
 of
 the
 green.


I
 mean,
 Microsoft's
 losing
 it,
 too.
 It


was
 up
 almost
 6%.
 Now,
 it's
 up
 2%.
 All


right.
 So,
 it's
 as
 soon
 as
 the
 market


opened,
 people
 decided
 to
 take
 some


profits,


>> which
 you
 had
 to
 think
 was
 coming
 at


some
 point.
 I
 didn't
 think
 it
 would
 come


at
 30
 and
 a
 half.
 I
 thought
 it
 would


have
 come
 if
 SoFi
 ran
 to
 33
 34.


>> Nvidia
 is
 the
 only
 one
 that's
 really


trying
 to
 go
 for
 it.
 It's
 got
 about
 50


cents
 to
 break
 all-time
 highs.
 I
 think


SoFi
 ends
 the
 day
 above
 30.
 I
 mean,


it
 would
 be
 surprising
 if
 they
 actually


took
 it
 back
 down
 to
 28
 29.


Yeah,
 especially
 since
 they
 weren't


there
 yesterday.


>> Yeah,
 especially
 because
 we
 have
 rate


cuts
 coming
 on
 as
 well.
 Again,
 Amcor,
 I


got
 to
 go
 through
 the
 earnings
 and
 see


what
 uh
 what
 they
 said.
 The
 only
 other


red
 flag
 I
 can
 say
 is
 uh
 gross
 margins


weren't
 as
 good
 as
 expected,
 but


management
 also
 talked
 about
 that
 and


they
 said
 their
 margin
 expansion
 is
 very


easy
 to
 come
 to.
 So,
 I
 got
 to
 go
 through


the
 earnings
 and
 then
 we'll
 kind
 of


analyze
 what's
 going
 on
 right
 there.


But,
 I
 mean,
 relatively
 the
 same
 price


that
 it
 was
 at
 last
 week,
 but
 that
 one


is
 taking
 it.
 the
 quarter
 itself
 there


it
 was
 record
 revenue
 so
 there's
 not
 an


issue
 with
 demand
 seems
 like
 there's
 a


broader
 issue
 with
 margins
 that's
 what's


hurting
 them
 Microsoft
 right
 here
 that


one
 is
 down
 or
 that
 one's
 up
 2%
 on
 the


day
 still
 app
 that
 goes
 flat
 Bitcoin
 115


and
 then
 Ethereum


at
 4100
 what's
 happening
 with
 Figma


where
 is
 Figma
 right
 here
 Figma
 goes
 red


on
 the
 I
 mean
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks
 that
 were


green
 in
 the
 pre-market


are
 getting
 hit


and
 I'm
 not
 sure
 exactly


Exactly.
 Why?
 Um,


okay.
 So,
 let's
 look
 at
 a
 couple
 of


their
 headlines
 that
 we
 got
 going
 on


here.
 The
 layoff
 stuff
 is
 the


interesting
 stuff
 of
 the
 day.
 Amazon
 and


uh
 UPS
 again
 announcing
 these
 layoffs,


which
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


wondering
 why
 exactly
 they're
 announcing


these
 layoffs.
 Is
 is
 the
 layoffs
 due
 to


lack
 of
 demand
 or
 is
 the
 layoffs
 due
 to


uh
 operational
 efficiencies?
 Steve,
 is


there
 any
 concern
 from
 you
 that
 the


labor
 market
 is
 weakening
 enough
 for


them
 to
 make
 these
 choices


>> in
 regards
 to
 what
 a
 rate
 cut?


>> No,
 in
 regards
 to
 UPS
 and
 Amazon.


Because
 if
 we
 start
 seeing
 like
 the
 tech


companies
 say
 we're
 laying
 off
 more


people,
 I
 mean,
 Amazon's
 the
 first
 one.


>> If
 Google
 had
 to
 do
 that,
 that
 that


would
 be
 a
 bit
 weird.


>> Yeah.
 But
 think
 about
 it.
 Why
 would
 UPS


be
 a
 surprise?
 their
 warehouse.
 They


have
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 that
 could
 be
 done


by
 robotics
 over
 the
 next
 couple
 of


years.


>> That's
 fair.
 Yeah.
 So,


>> it's
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 more


companies
 do
 that.
 I
 think
 you're
 going


to
 see
 it
 from
 Pepsi.
 I
 think
 you're


going
 to
 see
 it
 from
 Coca-Cola


eventually.
 I
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 see


a
 lot
 of
 automation
 over
 the
 next


several
 years.
 And
 it's
 very
 worrisome.


It's
 great
 for
 investors
 with
 margins


for
 the
 actual


job
 market.
 Unless
 we
 can
 figure
 out
 a


way
 to
 create
 new
 jobs,
 I'm
 very


worried.


>> Uh
 Lisa
 Sue
 on
 CNBC,
 let's
 go
 to
 her
 and


see
 what
 she
 has
 to
 say


>> for
 this
 country.
 So,
 we
 announced
 uh


two
 new
 supercomputers
 that
 use
 our


latest
 generation
 AI
 technology.
 And
 the


key
 is,
 you
 know,
 the
 focus
 from


Secretary
 Wright
 was
 let's
 do
 this
 as


fast
 as
 possible.
 We
 have
 so
 many


researchers
 in
 the
 nation
 that
 want
 more


computing
 and
 so
 yes,
 we're
 going
 to


develop
 two
 supercomputers.
 One
 of
 them


will
 be
 deployed
 um
 early
 next
 year
 and


then
 the
 other
 one
 uh
 will
 be
 deployed


with
 our
 next
 generation
 MI400
 series.


So
 fantastic
 uh
 partnership
 and
 I'm


really
 excited
 to
 be
 able
 to
 contribute


to
 this
 really
 important
 mission.


>> Uh
 I
 don't
 mean
 to
 belittle
 but
 I
 got
 to


talk
 a
 little
 horse
 race.
 You
 know
 I


think
 the
 MI400
 is
 in
 some
 ways
 equal
 to


Nvidia.
 I
 want
 to
 know
 whether
 this
 was


a
 contest
 and
 you
 got
 this
 and
 Nvidia


did
 not.


>> Well,
 as
 you
 know,
 Jim,
 I
 mean,
 this


this
 is
 a
 place
 where
 um
 you
 know,
 the


National
 Labs
 are,
 you
 know,
 truly
 a


national
 treasure
 for
 the
 United
 States.


Um
 Oakidge
 National
 Labs
 has
 been
 a


great
 partner
 for
 AMD
 and
 you
 can


imagine
 everybody
 would
 want
 their


compute
 in
 a
 national
 lab.
 So,
 MI400


series
 um
 is
 fantastic.
 We've
 been


working
 um
 across
 the
 board
 across
 all


industries
 um
 all
 of
 the
 national
 labs,


all
 the
 sovereign
 countries
 and
 I'm


super
 excited
 to
 be
 able
 to
 deploy
 both


our
 current
 generation
 um
 MI355
 and
 our


next
 generation
 MI4
 430
 um
 at
 the


Oakidge
 National
 Labs
 through
 these
 two


supercomputers.


>> Absolutely.
 What
 caught
 my
 eye
 in
 the


AMD
 release
 is
 that
 this
 is
 not
 just
 for


traditional
 supercomputing
 for
 tech.


this
 energy,
 medicine,
 health,
 national


security.
 This
 to
 me
 sounds
 like
 a
 a


government
 initiative
 to
 stay
 ahead
 of


everybody
 else
 in
 the
 world
 in
 all
 of


these
 verticals,
 not
 just
 traditional


data
 center
 compute.
 Can
 you
 tell
 us
 how


uh
 if
 I
 were
 say
 Thermoffisher
 or
 if
 I


were
 Eli
 Willie,
 I
 would
 be
 able
 to
 get


into
 this
 and
 say,
 I
 want
 some
 of
 that


compute
 power.


>> You're
 absolutely
 right,
 Jim.
 This
 is


actually
 a
 non-traditional
 uh


partnership
 between
 uh
 the
 government


and
 industry.
 What
 we
 thought
 to
 do
 was


number
 one,
 we
 want
 to
 get
 as
 much


compute
 as
 possible
 as
 quickly
 as


possible
 to
 the
 national
 labs
 and


they're
 going
 to
 do
 all
 kinds
 of


research
 in
 medicine
 and
 energy
 and


national
 security
 which
 is
 uh
 wonderful.


But
 we
 also
 said
 you
 know
 there
 are


industries
 that
 would
 uh
 private


industries
 that
 would
 like
 access
 to


some
 of
 this
 compute
 as
 well.
 So
 the
 Eli


Liies
 of
 the
 world,
 the
 thermoffishers,


all
 of
 these
 folks
 would
 also
 be
 able
 to


participate
 as
 we
 bring
 up
 these


clusters.
 And
 it
 is
 a
 very
 unique


partnership.
 Um
 I
 would
 say
 um
 you
 know,


Secretary
 Wright
 said
 it
 best.
 This
 is


the
 first
 time
 that
 he's
 announcing


something
 where
 you
 know
 the
 very
 first


time
 I
 met
 Secretary
 Wright,
 he
 said,


"Hey,
 bring
 me
 ideas,
 Lisa.
 Bring
 me


ideas
 that
 get


>> So
 five
 below
 30
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 other


stocks
 going
 red."
 So
 you
 do
 have
 some


selling
 pressure
 as
 we
 get
 into
 this


market
 open


>> us
 more
 AI
 in
 the
 government
 faster
 and


I
 have
 to
 say
 um
 he
 was
 very
 open.
 We


love
 the
 partnership
 with
 Oakidge


National
 Labs.
 Our
 engineers
 and


scientists
 are
 are
 really
 really
 excited


about
 contributing
 um
 at
 the
 national


scale
 for
 our
 our
 US
 AI
 efforts.
 Uh
 the


other
 big
 story,
 Lisa,
 that
 made
 news


regarding
 you
 guys
 in
 recent
 days
 was


IBM
 uh
 saying
 about
 four
 days
 ago
 that


one
 of
 their
 key
 quantum
 algos
 run
 on


chips
 from
 you
 that
 are
 pretty
 commonly


available
 and
 it's
 raised
 a
 lot
 of


questions
 about
 the
 the
 possibility
 of


commercializing
 those
 powerful


computers.


Well,
 we
 are
 also
 very
 excited
 about
 the


partnership
 with
 IBM
 and
 in
 in
 general


when
 you
 think
 about
 quantum
 computing,


you
 know,
 people
 were
 thinking
 that


quantum
 is,
 you
 know,
 it's
 going
 to
 take


years
 to
 develop
 and
 when
 you
 really


think
 about
 it,
 you
 know,
 we're
 not
 in
 a


place
 where
 we
 can
 wait
 years
 for
 these


developments.
 We
 want
 these


developments,
 you
 know,
 really
 making
 a


difference.
 Now,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 IBM
 um


and
 AMD
 announced
 this
 quantum
 computing


partnership.
 our
 researchers
 have
 been


working
 together
 and
 the
 key
 is
 we're


going
 to
 take
 the
 best
 of
 classical


compute
 or
 traditional
 compute
 which
 is


what
 uh
 you
 know
 we've
 spent
 um
 all
 of


this
 research
 and
 development
 on
 and
 the


best
 of
 IBM's
 quantum
 computing
 and


really
 putting
 them
 side
 by
 side
 in


applications
 so
 thinking
 about
 you
 know


how
 we
 solve
 the
 biggest
 material


science
 problems
 um
 how
 we
 think
 about


you
 know
 some
 of
 the
 biggest
 energy


problems
 and
 this
 is
 an
 area
 where
 you


know
 again
 when
 I
 think
 about
 the
 work


that
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 with
 DOE
 I
 think


it's
 going
 to
 continued.
 It's
 going
 to


be
 across
 all
 of
 these
 fields
 including


how
 do
 we
 get
 quantum
 uh
 you
 know
 used


in
 these
 new
 workloads
 as
 as
 soon
 as


possible.
 So
 this
 is
 kind
 of the
 world


that
 we're
 in
 with
 compute
 today.
 It's


all
 about
 speed
 and
 how
 do
 we
 get
 the


most
 compute
 on
 the
 most
 important


challenges
 as
 soon
 as
 possible.


>> All
 right.
 So
 Lisa
 Sue
 uh
 maintaining


the
 quantum
 narrative
 and
 kind
 of


continuing
 to
 say
 this
 is
 an
 important


technology.
 SoFi.


Ah,


>> I
 have
 a
 question
 about
 what
 we
 just


heard.


>> Yeah.


>> How
 on
 earth
 are
 these
 small
 quantum


companies
 going
 to
 compete
 with
 what
 she


just
 said?


>> I
 I
 I
 don't
 know.
 But
 the
 fact
 that
 she


said
 it
 is
 good
 for
 the
 quantum


companies.


>> I
 think
 it's
 good
 for
 quantum.
 I
 don't


know
 that
 it's
 good
 for
 the
 quantum


companies.
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 how
 you


compete
 against
 AMD
 and
 IBM
 like
 that.


>> Look,
 I
 agree.
 I
 have
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 how


they
 will
 compete.
 But
 the
 fact
 that
 the


narrative
 that
 quantum
 is
 a
 big
 thing


and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 investors
 that
 want


to
 get
 exposure
 to
 it
 and
 maybe
 they


don't
 want
 IBM
 or
 AMD.
 They
 want
 play


like
 an
 O
 andQ
 or
 a
 D-Wave
 or
 something.


I
 mean
 look,
 if
 you
 have
 really


important
 tech
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 there's


going
 to
 be
 a
 Quantum
 CEO
 that's
 going


to
 be
 interviewed
 by
 Jensen
 today
 on


stage.


>> Is
 there
 what
 time
 is
 it?
 The
 GTC


conference


>> 12
 p.m.


>> 12
 p.m.
 So
 that
 and
 and
 Olen
 just
 did
 a


podcast
 with
 a
 quantum
 physicist


yesterday.
 I
 mean
 there
 is
 enough


excitement
 in
 the
 industry
 even
 if
 those


companies
 you
 know
 maybe
 are
 not
 going


to
 be
 the
 absolute
 winners
 and
 I
 think


that's
 enough
 to
 kind
 of
 keep
 them


going.
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 19385
 that's


up
 1.2%
 AMD
 260.
 So
 Qualcomm
 yesterday


tried
 to
 rain
 on
 the
 parade
 of
 Nvidia


and
 AMD
 with
 some
 uh
 new
 chips.
 That


stock
 now
 down
 2.6%.
 Rosenblad
 did
 say


it's
 a
 buy
 and
 they
 think
 they
 can
 take


some
 market
 share
 away.
 About
 two


billion
 worth
 of
 revenue
 in
 fiscal
 year


2026
 on
 their
 new
 chips,
 but
 Street's


not
 buying
 it
 right
 now.
 Stocks
 down


2.7%
 right
 here.


>> All right,
 Amit,
 thank
 you
 for
 having


me.
 I
 am
 going
 to
 get
 going.
 I
 will
 see


you
 later
 today.


We'll
 see
 what
 happens.


>> SoFi
 is
 dumping
 2940.


>> SoFi,
 baby.


>> We
 knew
 it
 was
 going
 to
 happen.
 We
 all


tried
 faking
 it.
 We
 all
 tried
 saying,


"Oh,
 maybe
 this
 time
 is
 different."
 It's


not
 different.


>> No,
 you're
 right.
 You're
 right.
 At least


today
 it
 wasn't
 different.
 At
 least


today


>> wasn't
 different.
 All right,
 I'll
 see


you
 later.


>> Later.


SoFi,
 man.
 Freaking
 SoFi.


There
 you
 go.
 I
 mean,
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.


It
 is
 what
 What
 else
 can
 we
 What
 else


can
 we
 say,
 guys?
 It's
 SoFi.
 It's
 It's


freaking
 SoFi.
 like
 there's
 not
 there's


not
 much
 to
 say.
 I
 look
 it
 was
 a
 good


quarter
 by
 the
 way.
 Tesla
 getting
 a


massive
 move
 right
 here
 up
 1.69%.


So
 Tesla
 Tesla
 really
 making
 move.
 Not


sure
 why
 Tesla's
 moving,
 but
 it
 is


indeed
 moving.
 Um
 SoFi
 did
 announce
 with


Galileo
 that
 they're
 working
 with


Southwest.
 So
 you
 know
 we
 for
 everyone


who
 cares
 about
 the
 tech
 platform


growing,
 the
 tech
 platform
 did
 sign
 a


really
 big
 partner
 in
 Southwest


Airlines.
 That's
 not
 a
 small
 company
 and


that's
 good.
 VIX
 is
 up
 1.77%.
 That's
 why


market's
 going
 a
 little
 red.
 Not
 sure


why
 Tesla's
 getting
 the
 move
 right
 here.


I
 don't
 see
 a
 headline.
 It
 seems
 a
 bit


more
 technical
 or
 maybe
 just
 more


excitement
 based
 on
 uh
 the
 shareholder


meeting
 that's
 coming
 up
 on
 November


6th.
 But
 you
 do
 have
 Tessy
 making
 a
 move


in
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 sea
 of
 red.
 SoFi
 is
 just


getting
 clobbered
 down
 2.4%
 now
 on
 the


day.


As
 Tess
 says,
 SoFi
 triple
 bead
 pump
 and


dump
 like
 clockwork.


This
 is
 like,
 dude,
 every
 time
 Terra


Wolf
 gave
 preliminary
 earnings,
 so
 they


didn't
 give
 official
 earnings,
 they
 gave


preliminary
 earnings.
 And
 that's
 why


Terara
 Wolf
 is
 mooning
 right
 here,
 17%.


And
 looks
 like
 the
 street
 likes
 what
 you


got.
 Open,
 that's
 up
 about
 1.4%
 on
 the


day.
 Um,
 Terra
 Wolf
 said
 revenue
 will
 be


48
 to
 52
 million.
 That's
 up
 84%


year-over-year.
 Adjusted
 Ibida,
 instead


of
 6
 million
 last
 year,
 they're
 assuming


19
 million.
 That's
 a
 300%
 increase.
 full


results
 are
 going to
 be
 in
 November.


Management
 also
 expects
 to
 contract
 an


additional
 250
 to
 500
 megawatts
 annually


targeting
 long
 duration
 agreements
 with


investment
 grade
 counterparties.
 I
 mean,


you
 can't
 be
 more
 bullish
 than
 that.


You've
 got
 revenue
 growth
 and
 you've
 got


increased
 capacity
 for
 data
 centers,


which
 is
 everything
 the
 street
 cares


about
 on
 these
 Bitcoin
 mining
 companies


that
 have
 turned
 into
 data
 center
 plays.


Bitcoin
 right
 there
 115.3
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 as
 well.
 Bit
 mine


5379


as
 well.


Nate
 says
 try
 400%
 like
 Nebius.
 Nebas


12650.


I
 mean
 great
 recovery
 from
 94
 to
 126.


Some
 of
 these
 stocks
 we
 have
 not
 seen


recover
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 with


the
 draw
 down.
 Some
 of
 these
 stocks
 are


getting
 very
 close
 to
 recovering
 like
 a


hood
 and
 a
 nebas.
 So
 nice
 to
 see
 that


S&P
 just
 went
 red
 for
 the
 day.
 S&P
 went


red.
 Where
 is
 Beyond
 Meat,
 guys?
 There


is
 a
 legit
 cult
 around
 Beyond
 Meat.
 I


was
 saying
 this
 yesterday.
 I
 saw
 a


screenshot
 yesterday
 of
 someone
 who
 has


797,000


shares


and
 you
 know
 he
 I
 don't
 know if
 he's


trying
 to
 become
 the
 roaring
 kitty
 of


Beyond
 Meat
 but
 he
 is
 definitely
 uh
 you


know
 putting
 his
 money
 where
 his
 mouth


is.
 So
 I
 mean
 there
 are
 people
 that


definitely
 believe
 the
 the
 the
 the
 161%


short
 float
 is
 not


sustainable.


And
 yeah
 it
 was
 $7
 last
 week.
 It
 was
 it


got
 to
 850
 uh
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 It


fell
 to
 like
 160
 yesterday.


And
 now
 it's
 at
 two
 bucks.
 I
 don't
 know.


I
 don't
 think
 the
 story
 is
 over
 with


Beyond
 Meat.
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 story
 is


full.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 brewing


underneath
 and
 people
 think
 it
 could
 be


the
 next
 GameStop.
 ASST,
 that
 stock
 is


down
 10%
 on
 the
 day,
 147.
 We
 know
 we
 saw


this
 one
 surge
 40%
 yesterday.
 Uh
 they


did
 buy
 some
 more
 Bitcoin,
 so
 they


exercise
 some
 warrants.
 I
 think
 they
 now


have
 5,700
 Bitcoin.
 So,
 uh
 they
 are


trading
 if
 if
 you
 look
 at
 them
 as
 a
 pure


play
 treasury,
 which
 they're
 not.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 elements
 to
 it.


um
 you
 know
 they're
 like
 more
 of
 an


asset
 management
 firm
 in
 general
 but
 but


they
 are
 trading
 at
 0.81
 81
 NAV.
 So
 they


are
 trading
 at
 below
 NAV.
 If
 anyone


wants
 to
 get
 exposure
 to
 a
 Bitcoin


treasury,
 that
 is
 trading
 at
 below
 one


nav.
 You
 do
 have
 that
 with
 ASST.
 The


question
 is
 just,
 you
 know,
 can
 they


develop
 a
 premium
 to
 NAV
 over
 the
 long


term.
 Tesla
 right
 there
 at
 457
 and
 then


Nvidia


193.
 UPS
 again.
 I
 am
 still
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 why
 exactly
 they
 they're


cutting
 48,000.


That's
 not
 a
 typo.
 48,000
 people.
 uh


30,000
 operational,


18,000
 corporate.


I
 mean,
 I
 think
 it
 has
 to
 do
 with
 AI
 for


sure,
 but
 you
 can't
 tell
 me
 there
 might


not
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 demand
 issue
 in


the
 economy
 to
 cut
 48,000.
 Now,
 granted,


Steve
 made
 a
 good
 point
 that
 um
 that
 if


it's
 30,000
 operational
 jobs
 that
 are


going to
 be
 replaced
 by
 robotics,
 aka


not
 just
 like
 drivers
 and
 delivery


people,
 but
 rather
 the
 actual
 robots
 in


the
 factory
 that
 are
 taking
 away
 more


jobs,
 maybe
 it's
 not
 a
 question
 of


demand.
 Maybe
 it's
 a
 question
 of


efficiency,
 which
 is
 something
 we're


going
 to
 have
 to
 get
 used
 to
 with
 a
 lot


of
 these
 companies
 as
 they
 continue
 to


uh
 innovate
 with
 robotics.
 CleanSpark,


by
 the
 way,
 that's
 up
 1%.
 CleanSpark
 uh


signed
 a
 partnership
 with
 another
 center


or
 another
 facility
 to
 uh
 increase


capacity
 for
 data
 centers,
 and
 that's


why
 CleanSpark
 is
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a


mood
 right
 here.
 Uh
 Submer
 is
 its
 first


strategic
 partner
 for
 AI
 data
 center


expansion
 in
 North
 America.
 So,
 they've


officially
 picked
 a
 partner
 called


Submer
 and
 that
 will
 be
 helping
 them


expand


in
 North
 America.
 That's
 why
 CleanSpark


is
 up
 right
 now.
 Do
 people
 think
 it's
 a


demand
 issue
 or
 do
 people
 think
 it's


like
 a
 or
 do
 people
 think
 it's
 just
 an


AI
 issue?
 SoFi,
 my
 goodness,
 bro.
 What


did
 the
 street
 want?


What
 did
 they
 want?
 It
 was
 a
 good


quarter.
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 saw
 a
 red


flag
 in
 the
 quarter.
 Steve
 didn't
 see
 a


red
 flag
 in
 the
 quarter.
 I'll
 be
 curious


to
 see
 what
 Tanner
 thinks,
 but
 I
 don't


think
 anyone
 saw
 some
 like
 glaring
 red


flag
 that
 was
 like,
 "Yep,
 this
 is
 why


you
 got
 to
 be
 worried
 about
 SoFi."
 I


mean,
 there
 was
 good
 conversation
 about


crypto
 stable
 coins,
 the
 card
 that's


coming
 out
 uh
 on
 stable
 coin.
 Notto


said,
 "I
 could
 not
 be
 more
 excited
 about


the
 product
 roadmap
 and
 the
 multitude
 of


use
 cases
 we
 have
 for
 our
 plan
 stable


coin
 and
 our
 ability
 to
 differentiate
 a


stable
 coin
 like
 no
 other
 company."
 He's


talking
 about
 the
 bank
 license,
 giving


them
 bigger
 opportunities
 with
 their


stable
 coin.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 this
 one
 might


recover
 towards
 end
 of
 day.
 I
 mean
 like


I'm
 just
 guessing
 here,
 but
 like
 I
 I


don't
 think
 it
 deserves
 to
 be
 down
 at


these
 levels
 and
 I
 would
 wonder
 kind
 of


how
 the
 street
 would
 think
 of
 it
 as
 they


get
 some
 time
 to
 digest
 the
 results.


Pounder
 189,
 Robin
 Nood
 146,
 Tesla
 456.


Where
 is
 Rocket
 Lab?
 Rocker
 Lab
 right


here
 6531.


That
 one
 goes
 red.
 ESTs


7980.


Matt
 says,
 "What
 did
 the
 street
 want?"


They
 wanted
 more.
 I
 guess
 they
 wanted


more
 than
 this.
 Tess
 says
 it's
 just
 the


traders,
 not
 the
 investors.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean


I
 I
 I'd
 agree
 with
 that.
 Iran,
 by
 the


way,
 slightly
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 I
 do


think
 it's
 a
 lot
 more
 traders
 that
 are,


you
 know,
 toying
 with
 SoFi
 versus
 people


actually
 selling
 their
 positions.
 Here's


the
 heat
 map
 for
 the
 day.
 Pretty
 red
 to


be
 honest
 across
 healthcare,
 utilities,


consumer
 defensive
 tech
 is
 green.


The
 Microsoft
 Openi
 news
 was
 definitely


bullish
 to
 get
 the
 tech
 sector
 moving.


It
 wasn't
 the
 best
 for
 Google,
 although


I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 be
 I


mean
 Google
 just
 got
 anthropic
 to
 buy
 a


million
 TPUs.
 So
 okay,
 OpenAI
 sends
 a


partnership
 with
 Microsoft.
 Maybe


they're
 going to
 buy
 less
 GCP.
 They're


going
 to
 buy
 more
 Azure.
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 necessarily
 bearish
 Google,
 but


you
 do
 have
 Google
 right
 there
 267.
 It


did
 hit
 270
 yesterday
 as
 well.
 Did
 Apple


hit
 4
 trillion.
 Are
 we
 officially
 there?


No,
 we're
 not
 there
 yet.
 We
 are
 close.


We
 are
 very
 close.
 Microsoft
 is
 still


holding
 for
 trill.
 Apple
 is
 very
 close


to
 getting
 there.
 3.986


3.986


The
 Stonemason
 says,
 "I
 worked
 at
 UPS.


It's
 not
 robotics.
 Mostly
 getting
 smoked


by
 Amazon."
 You
 know,
 that's
 a
 good


point.
 I
 didn't
 even
 realize
 that
 maybe


it's
 competition
 that's
 causing
 UPS
 to


fire
 people,
 not
 like
 demand
 or


robotics.


I
 mean,
 we've
 seen
 Amazon
 start
 to


vertically
 integrate
 and
 have
 that
 not


be
 the
 best
 news
 for
 FedEx
 and
 UPS.


FedEx
 right
 there
 up
 about
 1.7%.


Yeah,
 that
 I
 mean
 maybe
 that's
 the
 bull


case
 for
 Amazon
 to
 be honest.
 PayPal
 is


still
 up
 10%.
 PayPal
 is
 really
 the


winner
 of
 the
 day
 out
 of
 all
 these


stocks.
 UNH
 lost
 its
 pre-market
 pump


flat
 on
 the
 day.
 So
 obviously
 lost
 it


down
 2%
 on
 the
 day.
 Uh
 SoFi
 didn't
 have


too
 much
 of
 a
 pump
 anyway.
 And
 PayPal


had
 a
 big
 pump
 and
 it's
 it's
 lost
 only


5%
 of
 it.
 It
 was
 up
 15
 now
 it's
 up
 10.


And
 you
 finally
 got
 this
 guy
 to
 move
 as


per
 an
 announcement
 with
 opening
 eye
 in


terms
 of
 Amcor.
 So
 here's
 what
 DA


Davidson
 said.
 They
 uh
 reiterate
 their


price
 target
 of
 40
 bucks.
 They
 said
 Amur


posted
 a
 solid
 three
 uh
 three
 three


third
 quarter
 and
 in
 line
 to
 slightly


positive
 fourth
 quarter
 guidance
 for
 the


street.
 However,
 the
 most
 exciting
 parts


of
 the
 call
 were
 indications
 that


several
 end
 markets
 are
 firming
 and


longerterm
 demand
 for
 the
 new
 Arizona


facility
 continues
 to
 rise.
 We
 remain


bullish.
 Amcor
 surprises
 street
 with
 the


announcement
 that
 the
 CEO
 intends
 to


retire.
 Chief
 operating
 officer
 will


assume
 the
 CEO
 role.
 The
 announcement


was
 unexpected,
 but
 we
 expect
 a
 smooth


CEO
 transition
 as
 Mr.
 Angel
 has
 been
 at


Amcor
 for
 over
 20
 years.
 So
 I
 think
 the


reason
 the
 stock
 is
 down
 quite
 frankly


it
 really
 is
 not
 about
 the
 numbers.
 It's


about
 the
 CEO
 leaving.
 We've
 seen
 this


many
 times
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 CEO


leaves
 and
 you
 know
 there's
 a
 leadership


shakeup
 and
 to
 the
 street
 I'll
 go
 sell


it
 off
 immediately.
 Uh
 I
 haven't


listened
 to
 the
 call
 yet
 but
 the
 overall


quarter
 seems
 you
 know
 pretty
 strong


especially
 with
 that
 Arizona
 factory.


Again
 there's
 not
 that
 many
 packaging


companies
 in
 the
 United
 States
 that
 are


doing
 domestic
 semiconductor


manufacturing.
 AMP
 core
 is
 one
 of
 a


handful
 and
 it
 was
 you
 know
 shown
 via


the
 the
 results
 and
 the
 guidance
 but
 you


do
 have
 the
 CEO
 leaving.
 S&P
 goes
 green


685


that
 goes
 up.
 It
 was
 at
 687
 recovering


from
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 the
 red.
 AMD
 as


well
 going
 a
 bit
 green
 259.
 Let's
 go


back
 to
 Lisa
 Sue
 and
 get
 a
 little
 bit


more
 of
 her
 thoughts
 on
 what's
 going
 on.


Oh,
 hold
 on
 one
 second.
 Let
 me
 reshare


this.


>> Okay,
 cool.


>> We're
 seeing
 an
 acceleration
 of
 the
 use


of
 AI
 because
 as
 models
 get
 better,
 as


enterprises
 are
 thinking
 about,
 you


know,
 how
 they
 can
 deploy
 these
 models,


uh
 there's
 a
 lot
 more
 compute
 that's


necessary
 and
 we're
 seeing
 that
 across


the
 board
 with
 the
 capex
 spending
 as


well
 as
 in
 our
 direct
 conversations
 with


customers.
 And
 you
 know
 David,
 I
 think


the
 most
 important
 thing
 for
 people
 to


recognize
 is
 a
 big
 market
 is
 good
 for


all
 of
 us.
 Uh
 that
 has
 been
 our
 mantra


is
 to
 develop
 technology
 that
 can
 go


across
 all
 of
 these
 verticals
 and
 I
 love


seeing
 our
 technology
 in
 the
 national


labs
 and
 also
 across
 all
 of
 these


enterprises
 and
 the
 cloud.
 Do
 you
 have


the
 ability
 to
 meet
 all
 this
 demand
 so


to
 speak
 and
 are
 you
 you
 know
 in
 terms


of
 GPU
 allocation
 whether
 it's
 cloud
 AI


enterprise
 customers
 the
 government
 do


you
 have
 to
 sort
 of
 tar
 them
 in
 terms
 of


who
 gets
 what
 first?


>> Well
 this
 is
 all
 about
 developing
 you


know
 not
 only
 great
 technology
 but
 also


a
 very
 resilient
 and
 robust
 supply
 chain


and
 we've
 been
 working
 on
 this
 for
 years


David
 when
 we
 think
 about
 all
 of
 the


research
 development
 and
 all
 the
 supply


chain
 efforts.
 So,
 we're
 certainly


ramping
 up
 our
 supply
 chain.
 You
 know,


we're
 thrilled
 with
 the
 deals
 that
 we


announced
 earlier
 this
 month
 with
 OpenAI


and
 Oracle.
 We're
 also
 very
 excited


about
 um
 the
 new
 deals
 that
 we
 just


announced
 uh
 with
 the
 Department
 of


Energy.
 And
 the
 key
 is,
 you
 know,
 more


people
 want
 u
 AI
 compute
 as
 soon
 as


possible.
 And
 I
 think
 what
 we
 have
 is
 an


extremely
 strong
 roadmap
 and
 and
 we're


excited
 to
 uh
 to
 see
 what
 we
 have
 going


forward
 with
 all
 of
 our
 partners.
 You


know,
 Lisa,
 I
 would
 love
 it
 I
 if
 you


could
 just
 get
 your
 crystal
 ball
 out
 and


just
 say
 uh
 what
 advice
 do
 you
 have?


You're
 a
 great
 teacher
 people
 to
 the
 21


to
 24
 year old
 that's
 thinking
 about


going
 in
 a
 business
 where
 there
 is


>> All
 right.
 So,
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 from


Lisa
 Sue.
 AMD
 right
 there
 at
 260.


Uh
 Terowolf
 again
 making
 a
 move.
 HUD


mining
 by
 the
 way
 got
 a
 price
 target


increase
 to
 78
 from
 36
 from
 benchmark.


Uh
 the
 analyst
 said
 we
 view
 HUD's
 uh
 HUD


stock
 as
 a
 HUD
 stock
 offering
 as
 a


flexible
 call
 option
 on
 not
 only
 the


most
 powerful
 technology
 and
 financial


mega
 trends
 of
 the
 decade
 the
 growth
 of


AIHPC
 but
 also
 on
 energyintensive
 use


cases
 to
 emerge
 in
 the
 earnest.
 Really


what
 you're
 seeing
 with
 these
 Bitcoin


miners
 is
 a
 ton
 of
 rerating
 Irene,
 you


know,
 being
 the
 the
 biggest
 beneficiary


of
 it
 so
 far.
 And
 then
 Cipher,
 IN
 going


red
 today,
 Cipher
 also
 not
 too
 far


behind
 of
 where
 they
 lie
 in
 the
 broader


AI
 data
 center
 stack.


And
 with
 Terolf,


uh,
 Cipher,
 Hutate
 Mining
 getting
 the


upgrade
 and
 INS


get
 some
 love.
 Now,
 are
 these
 attractive


valuations
 on
 these
 stocks?
 I
 don't


know.
 They
 are
 good
 growth.
 Like
 you


can't
 deny
 the
 growth.
 Like
 Galaxy
 grew


freaking
 you
 know
 200%
 on
 EPS.
 That's


amazing
 growth.
 But
 then
 Galaxy
 did
 a


billion
 dollar
 offering
 yesterday
 and


that's
 why
 the
 stock's
 down
 8%.
 So


there's
 dynamics
 of
 as
 Mike
 Novrat
 said


when
 he
 was
 on
 the
 show,
 the
 CEO
 of


Galaxy
 Digital
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago.
 You


have
 to
 understand
 the
 management
 team.


You
 have
 to
 understand
 the
 valuation.


You
 have
 to
 understand
 the
 uh
 licensing


and
 and
 leasing
 deals
 that
 these


companies
 have.
 Galaxy
 has
 a
 big
 deal


with
 Cororeweave
 which
 is
 a
 reputable


client.
 But
 all
 these
 things
 matter
 when


it
 comes
 to
 buying
 the
 data
 center
 plays


similar
 to
 Nebius
 or
 Cororeweave
 as


well.
 Nebius
 right
 there
 125
 that
 goes


right
 on
 the
 day.
 So
 all
 the
 data
 center


plays
 losing
 some
 luster.
 SoFi
 2980


that
 one
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 recovery


a
 bit
 of
 a
 recovery.
 Chat
 says
 admit
 you


spend
 you
 misspelled
 PayPal
 in
 your


title.
 Well,
 pay
 PayPal
 is
 a
 little
 less


uh
 painful
 today.


Up
 10.7%.


I'm
 happy
 for
 Suchin,
 dude.
 Suchin


freaking
 Suchin
 took
 a
 massive
 call


yesterday
 on
 PayPal
 and
 his
 leap
 should


be
 printing,
 which
 is
 nice.
 QXO,
 I
 know


this
 is
 a
 new
 stock
 that
 Steve's
 getting


interested
 in.
 Uh
 I
 have
 not
 done
 a
 ton


of
 due
 diligence
 on
 them.
 That's
 up


about
 1.6%.
 I
 think
 Steve
 eventually


will
 do.
 Well,
 no,
 Steve
 did
 an
 article


on
 them
 today.
 So,
 if
 anyone
 wants
 to


read
 the
 article,
 I'll
 link
 it.
 But,
 um,


yeah,
 we'll
 probably
 do
 an
 episode
 on


what
 he's
 thinking.
 Brad
 Jacobs,
 that's


what's
 catching
 his
 attention.
 We
 we
 did


a
 deep
 dive
 on
 GXO
 the
 other
 day,
 which


is
 a
 spin-off,
 also
 associated
 with
 Brad


Jacobs,
 so
 it's
 similar
 in
 that
 space.


SoFi,
 is
 it
 trying
 to
 go
 green?


Not
 yet.
 Still
 needs
 about
 30
 cents
 to


get
 green.
 Grab
 right
 there
 at
 613.


Tesla
 1.5.
 Tesla
 still
 moving.
 pound


here
 holding
 on
 to
 190
 two
 days
 in
 a


row.
 Crowd
 strikes
 at
 all-time
 highs.


Wow.
 542
 on
 Crowd
 Strike.


542


on
 Crowdstrike.


So
 says,
 "I
 like
 Wolf
 over
 Iran.
 Wolf
 is


backed
 by
 Google.
 25-year
 lease


agreement
 represents
 9.5
 billion


contracted
 revenue.
 Google
 backs
 stops


1.3
 billion
 of
 the
 lease
 as
 well."
 Yeah,


I've
 got
 to
 go
 deeper
 into
 the
 specifics


of
 how
 Google
 has
 structured
 their
 deal


with
 Wolf
 and
 Cipher
 because
 they've


invested
 in
 both,
 but
 Terolf
 right
 here


20%
 on
 these
 preliminary
 results.
 You


know,
 market
 cap
 of
 6.7
 billion.


It
 looks
 like
 the
 street
 is
 happy
 about


it.
 By
 the
 way,
 Bit
 Farms
 as
 well


slightly
 up
 on
 the
 day.
 Bit
 farms
 was
 at


670
 last
 week,
 660


back
 down
 to
 450,
 but
 up
 from
 $2,


which
 again,
 you
 can't
 be
 too
 mad
 about


if
 you
 were
 in
 it
 at
 two
 bucks.
 Netflix


getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 pump.


A
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 pump.


11:14
 on
 Netflix.


Your
 boy
 Jared
 Kushner
 is
 on
 the
 board


of
 QXO.
 Yeah,
 I
 found
 out
 today.
 Steve


was
 like,
 "Look
 at
 the
 board
 of


directors."
 I'm
 like,
 "Oh,
 I
 recognize


that
 guy."


Who
 knows?
 May
 maybe
 that's
 part
 of
 the


thesis.
 We
 We'll
 talk
 to
 Steve
 about
 it.


Try
 to
 get
 some
 more
 analysis.
 Reddit


right
 here
 down
 1%.
 PayPal
 still
 up
 11.


SMCI
 holding
 the
 50s,
 which
 is
 nice


after
 a
 drop
 to
 47.
 Intel,
 are
 we


getting
 a
 move
 on
 Intel?
 Intel
 is
 Wow,


Intel
 almost
 41
 after
 those
 earnings.


Intel
 almost
 41.
 Quantum
 names,
 D-Wave,


that's
 up
 1%.
 Dwave
 was
 up
 10%


yesterday.
 NQ,


that
 one
 goes
 red.
 And
 then
 Regetti,


that
 one
 is
 flat.
 Now
 again,
 there's


going
 to
 be
 the
 CEO
 of
 Inflection,
 if


I'm
 not
 wrong,
 ticker
 symbol
 CCCX.


Uh
 I
 think
 I
 believe
 that's
 the
 right


ticker
 who's
 going
 to
 be
 with
 Jensen


either
 today
 or
 tomorrow
 with
 GTC.
 So


you
 are
 going
 to
 get
 uh
 more
 coverage


with
 the
 quantum
 computing
 sector.
 You


had
 Lisa
 Sue
 just
 talk
 about
 it
 on
 CNBC


and
 you
 then
 had


you
 then
 had
 who
 else?
 uh
 you
 had
 you


had
 you
 had
 uh
 the
 Olan
 podcast
 do
 a


podcast
 with
 a
 physicist
 who's
 won
 a


Nobel
 Prize
 for
 quantum.
 So,
 you
 know,


again,
 I've
 been
 saying
 this
 for
 the


past
 week,
 but
 regardless
 of
 what
 you


think
 about
 the
 valuation
 of
 some
 of


these
 stocks,
 the
 momentum
 on
 the
 sector


is
 real.


And
 if
 any
 of
 these
 companies
 produce


some
 really
 good
 earnings,
 which
 they


have
 earnings
 coming
 up
 over
 the
 next


couple
 months,
 I
 mean,
 regardless
 of


valuation,
 if
 that
 momentum
 is
 strong,


you
 could
 see
 these
 stocks
 get
 a
 bit,


which
 is
 why
 again,
 I
 think
 short
 just


does
 not
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 right
 here.


Microsoft
 545.
 Microsoft
 has
 talked
 a


lot
 about
 quantum
 computing.
 Google
 made


a
 breakthrough
 last
 week.
 All
 these


things
 are
 still
 net
 positive
 for
 those


stocks


even
 if
 they're
 happening
 from
 bigger


companies.
 Microsoft
 again
 the
 big
 news


with
 OpenAI
 as
 is
 up
 2.4%
 on
 the
 day
 is


that
 they
 now
 own
 27%


of
 the
 company.
 135
 billion
 of
 equity


they
 own
 by
 OpenAI.
 The
 the
 the
 weirdest


thing
 about
 this
 though
 guys
 is
 look
 at


this
 first
 bullet
 point.
 Once
 AGI
 is


declared
 by
 OpenAI,
 the
 declaration
 will


now
 be
 verified
 by
 an
 independent
 expert


panel


like
 like
 they're
 saying
 we're
 going
 to


lose
 all
 of
 our
 IP
 rights
 in
 our


research
 that
 OpenAI
 has
 exclusively


granted
 us
 once
 they
 declare
 AGI
 and


there's
 some
 independent
 panel
 that's


going
 to
 make
 sure
 they've
 declared
 I'm


like
 what
 is
 AGI?
 How
 do
 we
 know
 what's


AGI?
 Like
 like
 I
 don't
 know.
 Give
 me


your
 best
 definition
 in
 the
 chat.
 What


does
 AI
 have
 to
 do
 to
 legit
 be
 AGI?
 But


it
 looks
 like
 that
 is
 the
 terms
 and


agreements
 that
 Microsoft
 has
 come
 to


with
 OpenAI.
 AMD,
 are
 we
 moving
 AMD?


Wow.
 Alltime
 highs
 on
 AMD.


There
 you
 go.
 Microsoft
 owns
 27%
 of
 Open


AI.
 Open
 eye
 owns
 10%
 of
 AMD.
 And


Microsoft
 buys
 GPUs
 from
 AMD.
 Exactly.


Microsoft
 owns
 30%
 of
 OpenAI.
 OpenAI


will
 eventually
 own
 10%
 of
 AMD.
 And
 then


Microsoft
 and
 Open
 are
 buying
 GPUs
 from


AMD.
 AMD
 right
 there.
 264.
 That's


getting
 a
 move.
 Are
 you
 streaming


Nvidia?
 Yes.
 12
 PM
 Eastern.
 I
 will
 be


streaming
 Nvidia.
 I
 gave
 up
 my
 dentist


appointment
 just
 to
 stream
 Nvidia's
 GTC.


So,
 you
 know,
 unfortunately,
 I
 don't
 get


to
 see
 the
 dentist,


but
 I'll
 get
 to
 see
 Jensen.
 Grab
 613.


Google
 goes
 red.
 And
 then
 SoFi
 still


down
 about
 1%


on
 the
 day.


Uh
 would
 open
 eye
 tap
 alphabet
 for


verification
 of
 progress
 towards
 AGI?
 I


it's
 some
 third-party
 independent
 panel


of
 experts.
 I
 just
 thought
 the
 wording


of
 it
 is
 so
 weird.
 Like
 who
 the
 heck
 is


going
 to
 be
 on
 that
 panel
 that
 can


legitimately
 say
 AGI
 has
 been
 achieved?


Like
 I
 would
 imagine
 that
 panel
 would
 be


created
 by
 people
 Microsoft
 thinks
 are


important,
 but


We
 are
 living
 through
 one
 of the
 most


incredible
 technological
 revolutions
 and


the
 fact
 that
 the
 deal
 is
 set
 up
 in
 a


way
 that
 has
 to
 determine
 when
 AGI
 is


achieved
 for
 Microsoft
 to
 lose
 all
 of


its
 exclusivity
 rights
 is
 quite


incredible
 and
 again
 not
 to
 mention
 open


buying
 250
 billion
 of
 Azure
 services.
 So


that's
 really
 going
 to
 help
 Microsoft


guidance
 and
 that's
 why
 the
 stock
 is


moving.
 Tesla
 461


remember
 alltime
 highs
 on
 Tesla
 is
 488


folks.
 It's
 not
 that
 far
 away.
 And
 this


is
 after
 they
 grew
 negative
 30%
 on


earnings.
 So,
 the
 street
 has
 absolutely


not
 cared
 about
 earnings.
 By
 the
 way,
 uh


Adam
 Jonas
 came
 out
 from
 Morgan
 Stanley


and
 he
 said,
 "I'm
 calling
 it
 Tesla
 has


achieved
 uh
 full
 self-driving


perfection."
 He
 put
 out
 a
 long
 note


yesterday
 to
 his
 client
 saying,
 "Look,


we
 like
 Tesla's
 done
 it.
 They
 figured
 it


out.
 And
 if
 we
 see
 the
 eventual
 impacts


of
 that
 long
 term,


then
 you
 know,
 that
 probably
 helps
 the


stock
 as
 well.


Chad
 says
 Sam
 Waltman
 is
 on
 the
 panel.


Yeah,
 that's
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 very


interesting
 to
 see
 what
 it
 is.
 Uh


Blackstone
 Saudi
 AI
 firm
 Humane
 Inc.
 $3


billion
 data
 center
 deal.
 That
 is


correct.
 That's
 a
 big
 headline
 with
 the


Saudis.
 They
 also
 did
 a
 contract
 with


Qualcomm
 yesterday.
 Uh
 they
 have
 a
 bunch


of
 contracts
 with
 AMD
 and
 Nvidia.
 So
 you


got
 the
 Saudis
 really
 starting
 to
 invest


a
 bit
 more
 into
 what
 we
 got
 on
 AI.
 Oh,


do
 we
 have
 consumer
 confidence
 today?
 We


do
 have
 consumer
 confidence
 for
 October.


I
 don't
 know
 how
 they're
 calculating
 it


because
 the
 government
 shut
 down,
 but


the
 number
 is
 94.6
 versus
 94.2.


94.6
 versus
 94.2.


Uh,
 looks
 like
 that's
 what
 the
 street


likes.
 Let's
 get
 some
 coverage
 on
 that


real
 quick.
 But
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 the


number
 isn't
 sequentially
 higher
 after


you
 take
 the
 revision
 into
 account.
 As


for
 present
 situation,
 one
 129.3
 much


better
 than
 expected.
 That
 follows
 125.4


4
 that
 gets
 upgraded
 to
 127.5.
 The


current
 read
 at
 129,
 also
 the
 best
 since


August
 when
 we
 were
 a
 little
 bit
 over


132.
 And
 finally,
 what
 what
 lies
 ahead?


Expectations
 71.5.


Uh
 this
 is
 a
 little
 weaker.
 Uh
 last


month
 was
 73.4,
 but
 it
 does
 get
 upgraded


to
 74.4.
 All right,
 so
 the
 number
 is


basically
 in
 line
 with
 expectations.


Very
 little
 uh
 misses,
 if
 there
 are
 any


misses.
 By
 the
 way,
 the
 10year
 is
 still


down
 below
 four,
 which
 is
 good.
 Uh,


where
 is
 gold?
 I'm
 going
 to
 guess
 it's


still
 down
 below
 4,000.
 Gold
 is
 still


down
 below.
 Gold
 is
 the
 lowest
 it's
 been


in
 three
 months,
 folks.
 Look
 at
 that.


3942.


Silver's
 up
 on
 the
 day.
 That's
 weird.


Silver's
 green.
 Gold
 continues
 to


plunge.


It
 was
 at
 4400


two
 weeks
 ago.


And
 obviously
 it's
 had
 a
 massive
 run
 so


no
 one
 can
 be
 that
 upset
 about
 it.
 But


nonetheless
 you
 are
 seeing
 a
 little
 bit


of
 weakness
 in
 gold.
 Maybe
 a
 rotation
 to


digital
 gold.
 Bitcoin
 right
 here
 115


officially
 green
 for
 the
 month
 which
 is


nice.


And
 you're
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 momentum


right
 here
 as
 well.
 Apple
 are
 we
 at
 4


trillion
 yet?
 Apple


gold
 posted
 terrible
 earnings.
 Apple's


not
 I
 think
 Apple
 needs
 270
 to
 be
 4


trillion
 or
 269.97
 I
 think
 is
 the
 exact


number.
 So,
 you
 need
 another
 dollar
 for


Apple
 to
 get
 to
 your
 four
 trill.
 Uh,


robo
 taxi
 updates.
 I
 didn't
 see
 any
 over


the
 past
 24
 hours.
 I
 mean,
 Elon
 hinted


to
 some
 updates
 in
 in
 in
 uh
 in
 robo
 taxi


expending
 to
 California
 on
 the
 earnings


call,
 but
 no,
 I
 see
 no
 headlines
 that


would
 give
 me
 a
 reason
 for
 Tesla
 to


pump,
 but
 it
 is
 indeed
 moving.
 You
 could


have
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks
 moving
 before
 GTC


as
 well.
 I
 mean,
 Jensen
 might
 just
 say
 a


bunch
 of
 stuff
 that
 is
 exciting
 for
 the


overall
 state
 of
 AI,
 and
 you
 could
 get


people
 wanting
 to
 play
 it
 from
 that


perspective.
 AMD
 just
 below
 all-time


highs
 at
 262.


Google
 just
 below
 270.
 Then
 SoFi
 still


stuck


at
 29.


Still
 stuck
 at
 2950.
 Micro
 Strategy,
 is


that
 above
 300?
 That
 is
 still
 not
 above


300
 yet.
 Yeah,
 the
 robo
 taxi
 still
 has
 a


safety
 person
 in
 the
 car.
 Well,
 that's


another
 thing.
 Adam
 Jonah
 said


yesterday,
 he
 he
 says
 that
 I
 think


they're
 very
 close
 to
 getting
 rid
 of
 the


safety
 person.
 And
 you
 know,
 if
 they
 do,


that's
 going
 to
 be
 vital
 for
 Tesla
 to


really
 start
 expanding.
 But
 as
 of
 now,


it's
 not
 there
 yet.
 Whimo,
 by
 the
 way,


said
 their
 fleet
 of
 robo
 taxis
 is
 now


driving
 on
 average
 286,000
 autonomous


miles
 per
 day,
 a
 51%
 increase
 from


February
 2025.
 The
 difference
 between


Whimo
 and
 Tesla
 is
 Tesla
 is
 the
 person


in
 the
 car,
 but
 Whimo
 is
 also
 geofenced.


Now
 Tesla
 is
 also
 geofenced
 but
 uh
 you


know
 Tesla
 would
 argue
 that
 Whimo
 is
 not


fully
 autonomous
 even
 though
 they
 don't


have
 someone
 in
 the
 car.
 I've
 been
 in
 a


Whimo
 before
 and
 you
 know
 it
 it
 it
 is
 a


real
 autonomous
 vehicle.
 So
 you
 do
 have


that
 differentiation
 from
 Whimo
 and


Tesla.
 By
 the
 way,
 XAI
 launched


Graipedia
 yesterday
 as
 their
 competitor


to
 Wikipedia.


So
 I
 played
 with
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 last


night.
 Uh
 I
 mean
 it's
 good.
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 know.
 Like
 the
 thing
 about


Wikipedia
 is
 people
 search
 something
 on


Google
 and
 then
 Wikipedia
 is
 the
 first


link
 that
 pops
 up
 and
 that's
 why
 people


use
 it.
 I
 I
 really
 don't
 think
 that
 many


people
 literally
 go
 to
 Wikipedia.com
 and


search
 something.
 It's
 usually
 a
 a


residual
 way
 for
 them
 to
 find
 content


based
 on
 a
 Google
 search.
 So
 I
 think


Grock
 would
 really
 have
 to
 hack
 SEO
 to


get
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 to
 leave
 Wiki
 and
 go


to
 Grock.


But
 it
 is
 one
 of
 their
 attempts
 to


break
 through.
 I
 I
 will
 say,
 you
 know,


objectively,
 and
 I'm
 a
 I'm
 a
 Elon
 guy.
 I


pay
 for
 Grock
 plus
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 Grock


is
 winning,
 at least
 on
 the
 consumer


level
 for
 the
 LLM
 race,
 and
 that's


because
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 use
 X.
 Like,


at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 they
 just
 don't.


And
 so,
 if
 X
 is
 their
 distribution
 hack,


you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 use
 YouTube


and
 Google
 products.
 So,
 Gemini
 has
 a


lot
 of
 ways
 to
 integrate.
 Chat
 had
 first


mover
 advantage,
 which
 is
 why
 they
 have


800
 million
 weeklies.


Grock
 has
 Elon
 with
 a
 megaphone
 which
 is


important
 but
 you
 know
 first
 of
 all
 a


lot
 of
 people
 don't
 like
 Elon
 and
 then


second
 of
 all
 it's
 like
 is
 that


megaphone
 large
 enough
 to
 get
 hundreds


of
 millions
 of
 users
 and
 Grock
 hasn't


disclosed
 their
 user
 count
 so
 we
 really


don't
 know
 how
 many
 people
 are
 using
 it


but
 Twitter
 only
 has
 200
 million
 dailies


so
 you
 know
 not
 all
 of
 them
 even
 care


about
 Grock
 so
 how
 many
 of
 them
 are


actually
 signing
 up
 for
 that
 I
 think


that
 is
 the
 broader
 question
 on
 if
 the


consumer
 part
 of
 the
 LM
 is
 going
 to


start
 really
 taking
 off
 right
 there
 193


3
 24
 as
 well.
 Verdive
 is
 down.
 Oh
 yeah,


I
 forgot.
 Whimo's
 owned
 by
 Google.
 I


mean,
 that's
 another
 argument
 for
 why


Google's
 been
 getting
 some
 love.
 Vertive


down
 3.3%.


Vistra
 right
 here
 down
 6%.
 Why
 are
 the


data
 center?
 Okay,
 I
 bet
 you
 Nebius
 is


down.


Nebius
 basically
 flat.
 So,
 it
 is
 down


from
 its
 high.
 C
 are
 all
 the
 data
 center


plays.
 Coreweave
 is
 barely
 up.


The
 Bitcoin
 miners
 are
 losing
 a
 lot
 of


steam
 outside
 of
 Terra
 Wolf
 because
 they


had
 good
 results.
 Why
 are
 Vistra
 and
 VST


down
 on
 the
 day?


That's
 a
 That's
 a
 pretty
 big
 That's
 6%.


That
 seems
 like
 a
 data
 center
 piece
 of


news
 that's
 causing
 it.
 I
 don't
 know
 why


these
 ones
 are
 down.
 I'll
 see
 if
 I
 can


get
 an
 update.
 APLD
 is
 up
 though.
 Okay,


so
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 divergence
 between


some
 of
 the
 data
 center
 plays
 versus
 the


other
 ones.
 Uh
 APLD
 making
 a
 move.
 So


still
 down
 about
 2%.


I
 don't
 see
 the
 headline
 on
 APLD.
 Again,


they
 had
 some
 headlines
 last
 week.


Obviously,
 they
 have
 that
 core
 deal
 from


June,
 but
 based
 on
 the
 earnings,
 that's


what
 really
 got
 this
 thing
 to
 start


moving.
 Terowolf


was
 uh
 the
 most
 important
 update
 today


in
 that
 space.
 Oh,
 Wayfair.
 So,
 we


didn't
 talk
 about
 this
 last
 night.


Wayfair
 was
 last,
 right?
 No,
 no.
 Wayfair


was
 in
 the
 morning.
 Okay.
 So,
 for
 those


that
 missed
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 show,
 dude,
 again,
 this


trend
 of
 earnings
 continuing
 to
 beat
 is


is
 like
 real.
 It's
 very
 real.
 So


obviously
 we
 saw
 PayPal
 that
 was
 a


massive
 beat,
 right?
 And
 it
 was
 really


good
 to
 see
 PayPal
 continue
 to
 get
 that


uh
 surge
 in
 in
 just
 momentum
 on
 the
 top


and
 the
 bottom
 line.
 Then
 you
 had
 SoFi


that
 had
 your
 double
 beat.
 Then
 you
 had


UPS
 that
 also
 had
 a
 double
 beat.
 They


beat
 by
 33%
 on
 EPS.
 That's
 a
 massive


beat.
 And
 then
 3%
 on
 revenue.
 And
 again,


a
 lot
 of these
 beats
 are
 happening
 on


EPS,
 not
 just
 revenue,
 which
 shows
 that


margin
 enhancement
 is
 um
 is
 coming.
 Then


Wayfair,
 which
 has
 to
 deal
 a
 lot
 with


the
 tariffs
 because
 they're
 selling


furniture.
 They
 beat
 by
 59%


on
 EPS.


I
 have
 no
 idea
 why.
 I
 have
 not
 gone


through
 their
 numbers.
 Wayfair
 obviously


is
 getting
 a
 big
 move
 today.
 It's
 up


21%.
 This
 is
 a
 low
 margin
 business
 that


has
 to
 deal
 with
 tariffs.
 I
 don't
 know


how
 the
 hell
 they
 beat
 by
 59%,
 but
 they


did.


And
 so
 regardless
 of
 if
 you
 own
 Wayfair


or
 not,
 it
 is
 very
 very
 healthy
 as
 a


market
 participant
 to
 see
 these


companies
 that
 shouldn't
 be
 putting
 up


60%
 EPS
 putting
 up
 those
 numbers.
 Tesla


by
 the
 way
 462
 high
 of
 day


and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 very
 exciting
 to


kind
 of
 see
 some
 of
 that
 momentum.


Applied
 digital
 achieves
 ready
 for


service
 for
 phase
 one
 at
 Polaris
 41


building
 for
 coreweave.
 Okay,
 so
 that's


what's
 helping
 APLD.
 that
 headline
 is


allowing
 them
 to
 get
 some
 momentum
 as


well.


Um,


Wayfair
 has
 free
 delivery.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean,


I
 was
 going
 to
 order
 a
 couple
 things


from
 Wayfair
 over
 the
 weekend.
 I
 just


didn't
 get
 a
 chance
 to
 do
 it
 yet,
 but


there's
 a
 couple
 of
 chairs
 and
 things


that
 I'm
 ordering
 and
 I
 I
 mean,


honestly,
 I
 forgot
 they
 were
 a
 public


company,
 but
 then
 I
 saw
 the
 earnings


today.
 I'm
 like,
 holy
 crap,
 that
 is
 like


not
 easy
 for
 them
 to
 put
 up
 these


numbers.
 But
 they
 did.


Um,
 Nanuclear,
 some
 of
 the
 other
 nuclear


names,
 that
 one
 is
 up
 5%.
 Okay,
 that
 one


goes
 green.
 Next
 Era,
 this
 is
 another


energy
 company
 that
 Google
 signed
 a


contract
 with
 yesterday.
 That's
 down
 1%.


So,
 you
 got
 some
 of
 the
 nuclear
 names


pumping
 maybe
 off
 one
 of
 the
 nuclear


headlines
 we
 saw
 this
 morning.
 Oaklo
 as


well
 up
 3%.
 Those
 headlines
 continuing


to
 give
 it
 some
 excitement.


The
 other
 energy
 names
 kind
 of
 down.
 GEV


is
 also
 down.
 Okay,
 so
 all
 the
 data


center
 energy
 plays,
 I
 shouldn't
 say
 all


of
 them,
 but
 some
 of
 the
 biggest
 ones


are
 down.
 GEV,
 VST,
 and
 VRT.


SMCI,
 Intel,
 Micron
 says,
 "Algo
 trading


benchmark
 showed
 record-breaking


results."
 Yeah,
 we
 saw
 that
 headline
 in


the
 morning
 and
 uh
 Micron's
 flat.
 It


definitely
 helped
 Intel.
 SMCI
 still


holding
 52.
 Intel
 right
 there
 just
 below


41.
 This
 is
 basically
 where
 it
 was
 at


before
 earning.
 Celestica,
 which


apparently
 is
 a
 Canadian
 company
 that
 is


up
 230%
 year
 to
 date,
 up
 another
 10%.


They
 crushed
 earnings
 again
 yesterday.
 I


asked
 Tanner
 if
 he
 knows
 about
 this


company.
 He
 said
 no,
 which
 was


surprising
 because
 there's
 not
 that
 many


Canadian
 companies,
 I
 think,
 that
 are
 up


this
 much
 this
 year,
 but
 it
 is.
 And
 that


one
 got
 some
 love.
 Intel
 right
 there,


40.88.
 Nvidia
 still
 holding


193


on
 the
 day.
 SMR,
 that's
 up
 9.4%.
 talked


about
 a
 nuclear
 headline
 in
 the
 morning


that
 was
 for
 a
 company
 that
 didn't
 have


to
 do
 with
 the
 Oaklows
 of the
 world
 or


the
 SMRs,
 but
 it
 looks
 like
 that


headline
 in
 and
 of
 itself
 is
 getting
 the


broader
 market
 more
 excited.
 Fermy
 is


probably
 up
 on
 that
 as
 well,
 right?


Fermy
 is
 a
 data
 center
 play.
 Fermy,
 they


just
 IPOed.
 Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 Up
 14%.


There's
 a
 divergence
 between
 some
 data


center
 energy
 plays
 today
 and
 the
 other


ones
 that
 are
 a
 lot
 bigger.
 Uh,
 and
 then


there's
 also
 divergence
 between
 some
 of


the
 Bitcoin
 miners
 today.
 Some
 that
 are


getting
 a
 lot
 of
 love
 like
 Terolf
 and


the
 others
 that
 are
 relatively
 flat.


Um,
 Skyworks
 headline.


There
 was
 an
 acquisition,
 right?
 Or


there
 was
 a
 merger
 between
 Skyworks


if
 I'm
 not
 wrong.
 Yes,
 there
 was.


Oh,
 there
 you
 go.
 Boom.
 Skyworks
 and


Corvo
 entered
 into
 an
 agreement
 to


combine
 creating
 a
 $22
 billion
 US-based


leader
 in
 high
 performance
 RF
 analog
 and


mix
 signal
 solutions.


Okay,
 so
 this
 is
 also
 probably
 helping
 a


bunch
 of
 the
 other
 data
 center
 names


that
 are
 derivatives
 of
 these
 companies


or
 work
 with
 these
 companies.
 But
 that


okay,
 so
 you're
 seeing
 some
 pretty
 big


updates,
 right?
 You
 got
 Terolf


preliminary
 earnings.
 You
 got
 a
 Skyworks


acquisition.
 You
 got
 some
 nuclear
 news,


but
 it's
 fragmented
 across
 a
 variety


of
 the
 different
 sectors.
 How
 is
 OpenAI


spending
 all
 this
 non-existent
 money?


That's
 a
 good
 question.


You
 know,
 sometimes
 I
 think
 the
 best


advice
 is
 to
 not
 ask
 any
 questions
 and


just
 to
 go
 along
 with
 it.
 And
 quite


frankly,
 sounds
 so
 toppy
 right
 now.
 It's


like,
 how
 do
 they
 have
 the
 money?
 Don't


worry
 about
 it.
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 ask


that
 question.
 Just
 look
 at
 AMD
 stock.


Look
 at
 Oracle
 stock.
 Look
 at
 Nvidia


stock.
 Look
 at
 Broadcom
 stock.
 That's


all
 you
 have
 to
 worry
 about.
 You
 don't


have
 to
 worry
 about
 where
 the
 money's


coming
 from.
 It's
 just
 money
 at
 the
 end.


They
 could
 print
 it.
 You
 know,
 it's


literally
 just
 money.
 Dude,
 that's
 when


we've
 achieved
 AGI.
 When
 it
 can
 print


money,
 I
 don't
 know
 how,
 but
 when
 it
 can


print
 money
 as
 easily
 as
 the
 Fed
 does,


that,
 ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 is
 AGI.
 Oh


yeah,
 CCJ,
 that
 was
 the
 company
 that
 had


a
 big
 nuclear
 announcement
 today.
 That's


why
 that
 stock,
 Wow.
 20%
 on
 the
 day.


That
 one
 is
 helping
 all
 the
 other


nuclear
 names.
 $45
 billion
 company.


I'll
 pull
 up
 the
 exact
 headline,
 but


that's
 what
 helped
 them.


What
 on
 earth
 is
 AGI?
 That's
 another


good
 question.
 Oh,
 CCJ
 partnered
 with


Brookfield.
 Yes.
 So,
 the
 partnership


with
 Brookfield
 today,
 that's
 we
 covered


that
 in
 the
 morning.
 That
 is
 what's


pumping
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 nuclear
 names
 right


now.


Fear
 and
 greed.
 Where
 are
 we?
 We
 were
 at


37
 yesterday.
 Oh,
 folks,
 we're
 at
 42.


We
 are
 closer
 to
 neutral.


You
 know
 what
 I
 would
 hate?
 I
 would
 hate


if
 we
 get
 to
 greed
 before
 the
 end
 of
 the


year,
 meaning
 we
 run
 up
 too
 quick


because
 then,
 and
 it's
 not
 like
 it's
 a


bad
 thing,
 it's
 just
 then
 you're


probably
 going
 to
 get
 some
 people
 just


in
 general,
 right?
 like
 markets
 are


probably
 going
 to
 sell
 off
 a
 little
 bit


in
 December
 because
 you
 know
 when
 you


get
 to
 greed
 extreme
 greed
 like
 there
 I


mean
 we
 saw
 this
 literally
 last
 time
 we


saw
 this
 on
 December
 18th
 2024
 we
 didn't


have
 the
 best
 end
 of
 year
 in
 2024
 we


really
 did
 the
 last
 two
 weeks
 we
 were
 a


bit
 more
 greedy
 and
 people
 took
 profits


and
 so
 it
 just
 wasn't
 the
 best
 end
 of


year.
 Um,


it
 really
 depends,
 I
 guess,
 where
 the


S&P
 go.
 I
 mean,
 I
 wonder
 if
 we
 hit


7,000,
 do
 we
 get
 to
 greed
 or
 if
 that
 is


neutral,
 but
 big
 tech
 earnings
 are
 going


to
 determine


a
 lot
 of
 it.
 Bitcoin
 116.
 Okay,
 Bitcoin


finally
 making
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move.
 We


haven't
 seen
 116
 since,
 well,


technically
 we
 saw
 it
 yesterday,
 but


realistically,
 we
 haven't
 seen
 it
 since


October
 8th.
 So,
 20
 days.
 Took
 about
 20


days
 to
 get
 back
 to
 these
 levels.


And
 we
 got
 five
 days
 left
 to
 close


above
 115
 to
 have
 a
 green
 October.
 Wow.


Tessy
 464.


Okay.
 I
 I
 don't
 see
 the
 headline
 for


Tesla,
 but
 Street
 loves
 it.
 Street
 loves


it.
 Gold
 still
 down
 another
 1.3%
 on
 the


day.
 The
 30,000
 Amazon
 layup.
 So,
 Amazon


clarified
 today
 it's
 going to
 be
 for


they
 said
 at
 least
 14,000
 with
 an
 upper


end
 of
 potentially
 30,000.
 So,
 they
 did


clarify
 it's
 not
 literally
 30,
 but
 it


could
 be
 30.
 People
 were
 too
 bearish
 on


this
 yesterday.
 I
 I
 think
 this
 is
 this


is
 corporate.
 I
 mean,
 Amazon
 literally


said
 it's
 corporate
 uh
 workers
 and
 this


is,
 you
 know,
 middle
 management.
 So,


Amazon
 saying,
 "Hey,
 do
 we
 need
 a


manager
 to
 manage
 a
 manager
 to
 manage


another
 manager
 that
 manages
 the
 actual


worker
 or
 can
 we
 use
 AI
 to
 automate
 some


of
 this
 stuff?"


Which
 I
 mean,
 look,
 it
 just
 feels
 like


it's
 inevitable
 that
 that's
 probably


going
 to
 happen
 in
 more
 places.
 But


people
 are
 saying,
 "Oh,
 Amazon
 has
 less


demand
 because
 of
 this."
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 a
 demand
 thing.
 I
 think
 it's
 an
 AI


thing.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 that
 might


not
 be
 the
 worst
 for
 Amazon
 in
 and
 of


itself.
 Uh
 UPS
 95.
 That
 one's
 still


green.


Sounds
 like
 the
 UK
 NHS.
 Okay.
 I'm
 not


saying
 that.
 You're
 saying
 that
 I
 love


the
 Brits.
 I
 love
 the
 NHS.


You
 know,
 I
 love
 that
 uh
 they
 they
 gave


Palunteer
 cool
 $500
 million
 to
 help
 them


modernize
 a
 bit.


But
 yeah,
 any
 bureaucratic
 organization,


right,
 might
 be
 think
 especially,
 look,


Amazon
 stock
 is
 flat.
 Amazon
 has
 vastly


underperformed
 the
 NASDAQ
 over
 the
 past


five
 years.
 You
 might
 have
 Jasse
 saying,


"Hey,
 we
 we
 need
 to
 we
 need
 to
 get
 some


 together
 to
 get
 this
 stock
 to


move."
 And
 it
 might
 be
 via
 layoffs


before
 we
 get
 into
 earnings.


That
 might
 be
 what's
 happening.


M
 What
 are
 you
 doing
 with
 your
 SoFi


position?
 Nothing.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 now


I'm
 just
 going
 to
 write
 calls
 against


it.
 If
 soofi
 stays
 stuck
 in
 this
 range,


then
 I
 mean
 what
 else
 can
 you
 do,
 right?


Like
 I
 expected
 I
 look
 I
 wanted
 a
 35
 on


a
 big
 catalyst
 on
 a
 good
 earnings.
 It


was
 a
 great
 earnings.
 You
 can't
 be
 upset


that
 it's
 not
 a
 35.
 It's
 not
 SoFi's


fault.
 It's
 it's
 the
 nature
 of
 the


market.
 So
 the
 only
 thing
 you
 can
 do
 now


is
 write
 calls
 against
 it
 and
 collect


some
 premium.
 Um
 I
 mean
 look
 tomorrow
 we


get
 rate
 cuts.
 So
 maybe
 that
 is
 the


catalyst
 for
 everything
 to
 get
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 move.
 Maybe
 Tesla
 new
 high
 of


day
 46430.


But
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 anything
 else


we
 can
 do
 with
 with
 sofa.


Is
 it
 worth
 buying
 some
 sofa?
 I
 mean,
 I


would
 want
 a
 better
 dip
 to
 buy
 more.
 So,


I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 down
 2%,
 right?
 Like,


I
 would
 want
 SoFi
 at least
 at
 27
 again


before
 I
 get
 excited
 to
 buy.


It's
 just
 a
 This
 is
 the
 option
 sellers


win
 today.
 If
 you
 sold
 calls
 on
 SoFi


today,
 you
 win.
 Everyone
 else
 loses.
 If


you
 bought
 calls,
 you
 lost.
 And
 if
 you


held
 it
 for
 a
 swing
 trade,
 I
 mean,
 you


know,
 you're
 not
 necessarily
 winning.


But
 if
 you
 sold
 some
 calls,
 like
 you're


doing
 okay.


Outside
 of
 that,
 it's
 just


not
 really
 making
 that
 big
 of a
 move.


UPS
 again,
 that
 announcement
 today
 to


lay
 off
 people.
 That
 stock
 up
 7%.
 But


still
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 Nvidia
 19331


is
 what
 you've
 got
 on
 Nvidia.
 Uh
 let's


get
 some
 more
 updates
 on


what's
 going
 on
 with
 some
 of
 this
 AI


stuff


uh
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 I


can
 pull
 some
 of
 this
 stuff
 up
 here.


Do
 we
 have
 any
 of
 these
 updates?
 Yeah,


let's
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 this
 coverage


right
 here
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going


from
 there.


>> Investors
 and
 CEOs
 coming
 here.
 This
 is


the
 sort
 of
 tentpole
 event
 that
 Saudi


Arabia
 has
 hosted
 for
 several
 years
 now.


And
 there
 are
 two,
 I
 would
 say,
 big


sectors
 represented
 here
 this
 year.
 It's


finance
 and
 its
 technology.
 And
 those


increasingly
 are
 the
 companies
 and
 the


the
 sectors
 that
 are
 pouring
 into
 the


Kingdom
 of
 Saudi
 Arabia.
 It's
 something


that
 was
 supercharged
 by
 President


Trump's
 visit
 here.
 Remember,
 I
 was
 here


for
 that
 and
 started
 to
 talk
 about
 in


May.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies
 are


doubling
 down.
 So
 there
 are
 world


leaders
 here
 as
 well.
 I
 had
 a
 chance
 to


moderate
 a
 panel
 with
 three
 finance


ministers
 from
 the
 UK,
 from
 Turkey,
 from


Qatar.
 And
 we
 talked
 a
 lot
 about
 AI
 as
 a


national
 strategy,
 how
 you
 protect
 your


own
 industry,
 but
 also
 partner
 with


other
 companies.
 Rachel
 Reeves,
 who's


the
 chancellor
 of
 the
 checker
 from
 the


UK,
 very
 much
 saying
 the
 UK
 is
 open
 for


business.
 We
 are
 deregulating.
 I
 think


something
 she
 was
 trying
 to
 underscore


as
 a
 differentiation
 point
 from,
 for


instance,
 Europe.
 Um,
 also
 coming
 off


the
 heels
 of
 some
 big
 AI
 deals
 announced


during
 President
 Trump's
 state
 visit
 to


the
 UK.


>> All right,
 so
 you
 got
 some
 AI
 stuff


going
 on
 in
 Saudi
 Arabia
 and
 that


potentially
 also
 could
 be
 a
 catalyst
 for


a
 lot
 of
 the
 AI
 names.
 Uh,
 some
 other


updates
 right
 here.
 The
 Qualcomm
 CEO


today
 said
 you
 can
 train
 on
 Nvidia
 and


run
 on
 Qualcomm.


So,
 you
 got
 the
 Qualcomm
 CEO
 making
 the


argument
 that
 you
 can
 run
 a
 lot
 of
 your


inference
 on
 Qualcomm
 even
 if
 you're


training
 on
 Nvidia.
 Uh
 Tesla
 flow,
 you


I'm
 looking
 at
 the
 option
 flow.
 You
 have


millions
 of
 dollars
 coming
 in
 to
 the


$500
 1114
 strike,
 the
 555
 January
 16th


strike
 and
 the
 455128


strike.


It's
 almost
 4
 to
 5
 million
 of
 premium


coming
 in.
 And
 then
 on
 Meta,
 someone


bought
 5
 million
 of
 Meta
 puts


expiring
 in
 3
 days.


Uh
 strike
 is
 755.


Where
 is
 Meta
 right
 now?
 Meta
 at
 the


moment
 is


748.
 Okay,
 so
 they
 might
 have
 bought


this
 a
 bit
 earlier
 when
 Meta
 was
 higher,


but
 there
 you
 go.
 some.
 Yeah,
 when
 Meta


was
 758,
 it
 looks
 like
 they
 bought
 these


755
 puts
 or
 at least
 above
 755.


Spent
 a
 good
 five
 million
 on
 it.
 I
 mean,


I
 don't
 actually
 hate
 that,
 dude.
 The


idea
 that
 Meta
 pumps
 all
 the
 way back
 to


800.
 I
 mean,
 maybe,
 but
 they've
 got
 to


put
 up
 some
 really
 good
 earnings
 to
 get


there.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 if
 we
 if
 we
 get
 that


BitMine
 right
 there
 5326.
 That's
 also


down


about
 half
 a
 percent.


Fanny
 May
 is
 Q3
 earnings
 tomorrow.


Something's
 going
 on.
 They've
 been


adding
 a
 lot
 of
 big
 names
 to
 their
 team


over
 the
 last
 month.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 in


Fanny
 May,
 you
 know,
 PY
 has
 gotten
 a
 lot


more
 people
 excited
 about
 that.
 So,


that's
 going
 to
 be
 an
 important
 earnings


for
 us
 to
 look
 at.
 Tesla's
 still
 moving.


Let
 me
 check
 resistance
 at
 465,
 folks.


Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 there.
 Uh
 Tesla


465
 resistance.
 Is
 SoFi
 losing
 29?
 Oh
 my


goodness,
 dude.


Freaking
 SoFi,
 dude.


Oh
 my
 goodness.
 Five
 cents
 away
 from


losing
 29.
 465
 resistance
 on
 TESI


is


71,000
 shares.
 71,000.


71,000
 for
 Tesla.
 Nvidia
 192
 Tesla
 464


pounder


189.


Sam
 Alolman
 says
 uh
 opening
 I
 will
 not


get
 a
 stake


in
 the
 forprofit
 restructuring.
 Hold
 on.


Let
 me
 see
 what
 Sam
 Oldman
 said.


Um,


do
 we
 have
 his
 exact
 quote
 on
 that?
 No,


we
 have


What
 does
 that
 mean?
 Sam
 Alman
 of
 OpenAI


says
 will
 not
 get
 a
 stake
 in
 OpenAI
 for


profit.
 Oh,
 he's
 saying
 Oh,
 I
 think
 he's


saying
 he
 Oh,
 yeah.
 He
 will
 not
 get
 the


stake.
 He
 will
 not
 get
 the
 stake.
 Okay.


So,
 I
 think
 he
 has
 a
 stake
 in
 the


nonprofit.
 And
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong,
 I


believe
 the
 stake
 is
 worth
 10
 billion.


So
 it
 looks
 like
 he
 has
 a
 stake
 in
 the


nonprofit,
 not
 a
 stake
 in
 the
 forprofit


restructuring
 enterprise
 of
 OpenAI.


Look,
 here's
 my
 take
 on
 this.
 Uh
 I
 think


Sam
 Alman
 is
 someone
 who
 does
 care
 about


achieving
 AGI
 and
 like
 you
 know
 making


sure
 that
 AI
 is
 something
 that
 is


achieved
 in
 our
 lifetime
 in
 terms
 of
 the


highest
 potential
 of
 it.
 I
 do
 not
 think


this
 guy
 is
 not
 money
 motivated.
 I
 know


he
 tries
 to
 create
 an
 image
 that
 he's


not
 money
 motivated.
 I
 mean
 that
 famous


congressional
 speech
 where
 you
 know
 they


were
 like
 hey
 you
 know
 how
 much
 money
 do


you
 make
 and
 he's
 like
 oh
 I
 don't
 make


any
 money
 I
 do
 this
 with
 love.
 It's
 like


I
 don't
 know
 bro
 because
 if
 that
 was
 the


case
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 controversy


with
 Elon
 wouldn't
 be
 what
 it
 is
 today.


A
 lot
 of
 this
 has
 to
 do
 with
 the
 fact


that
 Elon
 funded
 OpenAI
 with
 50
 million


bucks
 and
 Elon
 has
 no
 stake
 in
 it.
 Not


the
 for-profit,
 not
 the
 nonprofit,
 not


the
 PBC,
 anything.
 And
 you
 would
 imagine


if
 Sam
 Alman
 doesn't
 care
 about
 money


that
 that
 wouldn't
 necessarily
 be
 a


point
 of
 contention,


but
 I
 feel
 like
 he's
 not
 necessarily
 the


most
 honest
 there.
 Also,
 we're
 talking


about
 AGI,
 folks.
 We
 are
 talking
 about


trillions
 and
 trillions
 of
 dollars.


You're
 telling
 me
 the
 guy
 that's
 putting


in
 all
 the
 work
 as
 the
 CEO
 of
 the


company
 that's
 leading
 that
 revolution


doesn't
 care
 about
 being
 rewarded
 for
 I


mean,
 like
 just
 it's
 just
 human
 nature.


like
 you
 want
 somewhat
 of
 an
 equity


stake
 because
 you're
 you
 know
 you're


you're
 potentially
 building
 a
 multi-


trillion
 dollar
 enterprise.


So
 I
 think
 we're
 going to
 have
 to
 see


what
 his
 exact
 ownership
 stake
 is.
 But


even
 if
 it's
 not
 in
 the
 for-profit


company,
 I
 think
 he
 will
 still
 have
 a


significant
 ownership
 stake
 in
 the


nonprofit.
 Microsoft
 right
 there
 545.


That's
 up
 2.65%


on
 the
 day.
 PayPal
 is
 still
 moving.


PayPal
 right
 here.
 It
 was
 up
 10%.


PayPal.
 Wow.
 Up
 12%.
 It's
 not
 really


giving
 up
 the
 pump.
 Yo,
 put
 in
 the
 chat


if
 you
 own
 PayPal.
 I
 mean,
 today
 is
 your


day.
 Today
 is
 your
 day.
 There's
 not
 many


times
 in
 the
 past
 three
 years
 that
 we've


seen
 PayPal
 actually
 hold
 a
 pump.
 Forget


12%.
 It's
 barely
 been
 able
 to
 hold
 two


or
 3%.


This
 is
 actually
 a
 really
 big
 deal
 for


PayPal.
 And
 again,
 why?
 Well,
 they
 they


called
 up
 Sam
 Alman
 and
 said,
 "Hey,
 we


need
 some
 help."


And
 as
 a
 result
 of
 announcing
 their


partnership,
 there
 you
 go.


Did
 people
 sell
 too?
 It's
 been
 painful.


I
 own
 a
 little
 of
 it.
 I
 have
 a
 little


more.
 Nordic
 says
 I
 have
 a
 pain
 I
 have
 a


PayPal
 account.


Um,


that's
 hilarious.


Um,


uh,
 okay.
 Let
 me
 let
 me
 pull
 up
 this


video
 as
 well.
 This
 is
 the
 what
 the


video
 looks
 like
 for
 Chat
 GBT
 to
 check


out
 with
 PayPal.
 As
 you
 can
 see
 right


there,
 this
 is
 why
 the
 stock
 is
 really


moving
 today.
 Also,
 they
 gave
 a
 dividend


finally.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 now
 every


dividend
 ETF
 can
 buy
 PayPal
 and
 they
 can


justify
 it
 because
 there's
 a
 dividend.


And
 also,
 it's
 I
 mean,
 we
 know
 PayPal's


undervalued,
 so
 maybe
 it's
 not
 the
 worst


buy
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 dividend
 ETFs,


but
 this
 video
 right
 here,
 Chad


integration


is
 why
 you're
 getting
 some
 love.


So,
 that's
 what
 you
 got
 on
 PayPal.


PayPal
 right
 there,
 78.50.
 That's
 up


11.2%
 2%
 on
 the
 day.


There
 you
 go.


Vistra
 is
 down
 6%
 because
 the
 CEO


planned
 to
 sell
 for
 some
 taxes.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 kind
 of
 stupid.
 If


the
 CEO
 is
 selling
 and
 it's
 already
 a


planned
 sell
 for
 taxes,
 that's
 just


probably
 the
 ALGO


interpreting
 it
 negatively.
 I
 mean,
 this


is
 what
 the
 ALOS
 do,
 right?
 They
 get
 a


headline
 and
 they
 get
 hit.
 Wow,
 Intel


though,
 5%.
 Intel
 breaking
 the
 highs


that
 it
 was
 at
 last
 week,


which
 is
 nice
 to
 see
 after
 the
 earnings.


Um,


and
 there
 you
 go.
 Intel
 right
 there,


4154.
 That's
 up
 5%.
 Nvidia


192


53.
 He's
 selling
 8
 million.


All right.
 Well,
 the
 stock
 is
 upset


about
 that.


Intel
 is
 still
 up
 5%.
 URI
 is
 up
 16%.
 I


know
 this
 company.
 Oh,
 uranium.
 Wow.
 A


lot
 of
 the
 nuclear
 names
 and
 uranium


obviously
 a
 big
 component
 of
 that


getting
 some
 love
 based
 on
 that
 um


Brookfield
 deal
 with
 CCJ.


There
 you
 go.
 Energy
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


theme
 for
 2026.


And
 some
 of
 these
 names
 are
 really


benefiting
 from
 the
 the
 leadership
 in


energy.
 S&P
 still
 up
 on
 the
 day
 and
 then


AMD


261.
 Where
 is
 Soundhound?


Soundhound
 up
 about
 1%.
 Beyond
 Meat,
 are


we
 still
 moving
 on
 that?
 Beyond
 Meat


19207,
 that's
 up
 14%.
 And
 then
 ASST,


that
 stock's
 still
 down
 10%.


The
 nuclear
 ETF
 is
 up
 7%.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean


again
 the
 headlines
 on
 that
 should
 just


continue
 to
 get
 more
 and
 more
 excitement


across
 the
 board.
 Uh
 Barclays
 is
 buying


Best
 Egg
 for
 800
 million.
 Best
 Egg


originates
 unsecured
 personal
 loans
 that


Barclays
 can
 package
 into
 an
 assetbased


security.
 The
 platform
 has
 about
 11


billion
 in
 loans
 and
 expects
 to


originate
 7
 billion
 more
 this
 year.
 I


mean
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 lot


more
 consolidation
 in
 the
 banking
 space.


Jamie
 Diamond
 talked
 about
 that
 as
 well.


So
 you
 are
 seeing
 Barkclay's


bet
 on
 some
 of
 the
 broader
 consumer


lending
 companies.
 And
 look,
 they


wouldn't
 be
 buying
 a
 company
 like
 Best


for
 800
 million
 if
 they
 thought
 consumer


loans
 were
 default
 or
 delinquent,


which
 is


uh
 the
 opposite
 narrative
 that
 you
 know


some
 of
 the
 regional
 banks
 potentially


painted.
 So
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 a


consumer
 credit
 problem
 as
 aggressively


as
 you
 know
 some
 people
 may
 be
 thinking.


Now
 it's
 something
 we
 have
 to
 watch
 out


for
 because
 auto
 delinquencies
 and


credit
 card
 delinquencies
 aren't
 the


best,
 but
 they're
 also
 not
 the
 worst,


which
 means
 it
 might
 not
 be
 as


structural.
 Wayfair
 still
 up
 19%


on
 the
 day.


Still
 up
 19%
 on
 the
 day.
 Skyworks
 by
 the


way
 is
 up
 13%
 as
 well.
 13.5.
 That
 was


based
 on
 the
 merger
 that
 they
 announced


today.
 So
 that
 one
 also
 getting
 some


love.
 Year
 to
 date
 it's
 still
 down
 2%.


But
 today


up
 13.5.


I
 think
 I'm
 going to
 have
 the
 Redcat
 CEO


on
 the
 show
 tomorrow
 guys.
 So,
 we'll


talk
 to
 him
 um
 and
 we'll
 get
 his
 update


on
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 the
 new


partnership.
 The
 announcement
 pounder


that's
 up
 5%.
 I
 think
 tomorrow
 we're


going
 to
 be
 live
 all
 day.
 I
 think
 we
 I


mean
 we
 have
 JPAL
 at
 2
 o'clock.
 Then
 we


have
 big
 tech
 earnings
 at
 4.


We
 usually
 end
 the
 stream
 at
 like
 11.


So,
 it's
 really
 just
 two
 hours
 between


11
 and
 two.
 So,
 I
 feel
 like
 we
 might
 as


well
 just
 go
 live
 the
 whole
 day.
 We'll


bring
 on
 some
 guests.
 We'll
 talk
 to
 a


bunch
 of
 people.


I
 think
 tomorrow's
 going
 to
 be
 an
 old


day
 stream.


Your
 boy's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 eating
 for


like
 10
 hours,
 dude.
 It'll
 be
 fun


though.
 It'll
 be
 fun.
 I
 may
 ask
 about


the
 show
 report.
 Yes,
 I'll
 ask
 him
 about


the
 show
 report
 as
 well.


We'll
 see
 what
 uh
 what
 he
 has
 to
 say.


Oh,
 it's
 three
 hours
 before
 11
 and
 two,


right?
 12
 one
 two.
 Yeah,
 three
 hours.


Okay,
 we'll
 pass
 the
 time
 with
 three


hours.
 You
 know,
 we
 can


can
 find
 a
 way
 to
 talk
 about
 something


with
 three
 hours.


Um,


two
 hours
 between
 11
 and
 two.
 Your
 mom


would
 be
 proud.


Oh
 my
 gosh,
 dude.


S&P
 686
 SoFi
 still
 red


on
 the
 day.
 We
 can
 look
 at
 more
 cringe


photos
 for
 three
 hours.


Dude,
 my
 assistant
 picked
 out
 those


photos.
 What
 do
 you
 want
 me
 to
 say?
 like


I
 didn't
 get
 a
 chance
 to
 look
 at
 them,


so
 she
 picked
 out
 whatever
 she
 could
 and


and
 I
 showed
 it
 to
 you.
 All right,
 Trump


and
 Japan.
 So,
 we
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 clips


yesterday
 from
 Trump
 going
 to
 Japan.
 He


had
 a
 really
 good
 meeting
 with
 the


newest
 prime
 minister.
 Here
 are
 some


things
 that
 uh
 that
 Trump
 had
 to
 say


based
 on
 the
 meeting.


>> Phenomenal
 day
 here
 in
 Japan
 with
 a


momentous
 trade
 deal.
 We
 made
 a
 big
 big


beautiful
 trade
 deal
 for
 both
 countries.


In
 fact,
 to
 the
 best
 of
 my
 knowledge,
 I


think
 Japan
 also
 had
 their
 best
 stock


market
 day
 ever.
 So,
 your
 new
 prime


minister
 is
 doing
 very
 well.
 First


female,
 first
 woman
 prime
 minister.
 And


I
 said,
 you
 already
 hit
 the
 highest


stock
 price
 you've
 ever
 hit.
 So,
 she's


very
 happy.
 And
 we
 spent
 the
 whole
 day


together.
 It
 was
 beautiful.
 And
 she's


she's
 great.
 We
 went
 out
 to
 the
 George


USS
 George
 Washington,
 the
 SS
 George


Washington.
 It
 was
 uh
 it
 was
 really


great.
 This
 the
 uh
 the
 sailors
 and
 a
 lot


of
 others.
 We
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 people,
 a
 lot


of
 military
 people
 were
 there,
 but
 boy,


there
 was
 some
 scene.
 It
 was
 incredible.


You
 wouldn't
 believe
 that
 a
 ship
 could


hold
 that
 many
 people.
 But
 I
 just
 want


to
 uh
 say
 that
 she
 is
 a
 delight
 and


she's
 going
 to
 be
 I
 think
 she's
 going
 to


be
 a
 great
 prime
 minister.
 Really
 do.


I've
 got
 to
 know
 pretty
 well
 in
 a
 short


period
 of
 time.
 She
 was
 a
 very
 good


friend
 and
 ally
 of
 Shinszo
 Ababi
 who
 was


a
 friend
 of
 mine,
 one
 of
 my
 best
 friends


in
 terms
 of
 this
 world,
 the
 world
 of


nations.
 And
 uh
 he
 was
 a
 great
 man
 and


he
 got
 unfortunately
 what
 happened
 to


him
 was
 sad,
 very
 sad,
 but
 uh
 he
 was
 a


great
 leader
 and
 uh
 we
 we
 miss
 him
 very


much.
 But
 a
 fantastic
 tribute
 to
 the
 US


Japanese
 alliance
 aboard
 that
 ship.


>> Uh
 and
 then
 this
 is
 what
 Trump
 said


about
 the
 meeting
 with
 Xi
 coming
 up


soon.


>> I'll
 be
 meeting
 with
 uh
 President
 Xi
 the


day
 after
 tomorrow.
 I'm
 going
 to
 uh
 a


wonderful
 place
 where
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


you
 may
 be
 going.
 Uh
 we're
 going
 to
 be


meeting
 tomorrow
 at
 a
 very
 fantastic


meeting.
 Who's
 going
 tomorrow?
 Is


anybody
 going
 that
 I
 know
 in
 this
 room?


I
 think
 a
 lot.
 Tim,
 are
 you
 going?


Maybe.
 You're
 not.
 You
 mean
 you
 came


here
 for
 this


>> and
 you're
 just
 going
 back
 just
 like


that?
 Huh?
 Well,
 we'll
 go
 be
 going
 to


South
 Korea
 and
 then
 on
 the
 following


day
 a
 meeting
 with
 President
 Chi
 as
 you


probably
 heard.
 I'd
 be
 surprised
 if


anybody
 didn't
 hear.
 That's
 a
 big
 big


meeting
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 work


out
 very
 well.
 Actually,
 I
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 great.


>> I
 think
 the
 meeting
 will
 work
 out
 very


well.
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 great.


Again,
 that's
 also
 why
 the
 markets
 have


lowered
 their
 assumptions
 of
 the
 China


tensions


increasing.
 if
 Trump
 is
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 negotiate
 meaningfully
 with
 uh
 with


G.
 By
 the
 way,
 this
 Japanese
 PM,
 she


seems
 to
 like
 Trump.
 Reuters
 Reuters
 is


reporting
 today
 that
 she
 plans
 to


recommend
 Trump
 for
 the
 Nobel
 Peace


Prize.


So,


I
 mean,


not
 only
 that,
 she's
 planning
 to
 buy
 a


ton
 of
 more
 soybeans
 as
 well.
 She


already
 bought
 a
 ton
 of
 F-150s
 from


Ford.


So,
 she's
 buying
 soybeans,
 she's
 buying


our
 trucks.
 Japan
 is
 already
 investing


550
 billion
 as
 per
 the
 trade
 deal
 they


uh
 they
 they
 settled
 on
 three
 months


ago.
 And
 she's
 going
 to
 nominate
 him


potentially
 for
 the
 Nobel
 Peace
 Prize.


I
 mean,
 Japan
 is
 making
 sure
 they
 lock


in
 with
 Trump.


The
 happier
 the
 puses,
 the
 better
 for


all
 of
 us.
 No,
 that's
 a
 fact,
 bro.
 Trump


gets
 upset,
 we
 get
 some
 tweets,
 we
 lose


hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 dollars
 within


seconds.


Just
 keep
 this
 guy
 happy,
 bro.


Just
 keep
 him
 happy.
 Is
 Sofi
 still
 down?


Where's
 SoFi?


Oh
 my
 goodness.
 She
 lost
 29.


Oh
 my
 goodness.


She
 lost
 29.


Why
 not?


Why
 not?
 28.887.


This
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 This
 what
 you
 got.


We
 got
 so
 far.
 Entire
 market
 is
 falling.


Are
 we?
 S&P
 is
 still
 green.
 Yeah,
 S&P's


still looking still
 is.
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 the
 entire
 market.
 You
 do
 have


Google
 down,
 Grabs
 down,
 Reddit's
 down,


Amazon's
 down.
 Amazon
 slightly
 down.


Meta
 losing
 750.


Apple's
 down.
 Tesla
 still
 holding
 460,


but
 SoFi
 getting
 hit.


Also,
 no
 one
 blamed
 Tanner
 for
 SoFi.
 I'm


obviously
 just
 joking
 when
 I
 when
 I
 say


we're
 going
 to
 blame
 Tanner.
 Tanner


can't
 control
 anything
 about
 it.


Tanner's
 done
 a
 phenomenal
 job
 analyzing


this
 company.
 It's
 more
 so
 a
 joke


because
 it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 the
 reason


I
 kept
 saying
 this
 because
 like
 maybe


Tanner
 can
 finally
 be
 the
 reason
 why


this
 stock
 doesn't
 dump
 after
 earnings.


Uh
 but
 you
 know,
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 It's


how
 SoFi
 trades.
 Now
 granted,
 SoFi
 is


still
 up
 100%
 year
 to
 date.
 And
 SoFi


likely,
 in
 my
 opinion,
 towards
 the
 end


of
 the
 year
 will
 inch
 up
 to
 35.
 And


that's
 just
 how
 SoFi
 tends
 to
 to
 move
 as


a
 stock.
 It
 doesn't
 move
 on
 earnings
 to


the
 upside.
 It
 dumps
 on
 on
 earnings
 and


then
 randomly
 you'll
 wake
 up
 and
 it


starts
 making
 a
 move.


So,
 as
 much
 as
 I
 want
 to
 blame
 Tanner,


it
 really
 is
 not
 based
 on
 Tanner.


If
 they're
 going
 to
 dump
 it
 now,
 they


need
 to
 dump
 it.
 Like,
 if
 they're
 going


to
 like
 at
 this
 point,
 let
 me
 buy
 it


back
 at
 2526.
 Like,
 this
 is
 the
 thing
 I


hate.
 I
 think
 you
 guys
 would
 agree.
 You


hate
 like
 if
 you're
 if
 a
 stock
 is
 going


to
 give
 you
 a
 dip,
 give
 a
 real
 dip.


Don't
 give
 these
 stupid
 dips.
 Like,
 if


you're
 going
 to
 take
 it
 down,
 then
 take


it
 all
 the
 way
 down
 and
 let
 people
 buy


because
 we
 know
 it's
 a
 fundamental
 good


company.
 nothing
 in
 that
 quarter


justified
 a
 4%
 downside
 move.
 I
 mean,
 I


can't
 think
 of
 anything
 outside
 of
 maybe


the
 stock
 was
 pumping
 too
 much.
 And
 so,


if
 that's
 the
 case,
 then
 fine,
 but


give
 us
 some
 more
 pain.


Matt
 says,
 "Screw
 that.
 We're
 going
 to


blame
 Tanner."


I
 don't
 blame
 Tanner.
 I
 blame
 TJ's


strangle.
 Yeah.
 Didn't
 Wait,
 what
 strike


did
 TJ
 have
 on
 the
 top
 part
 of
 his


strangle
 for
 the
 calls?
 Cuz
 TJ
 needed


SoFi
 not
 to
 move
 that
 higher
 either,


right?
 Was
 it
 like
 32?
 I
 think
 he
 needed


to
 keep
 it
 below
 32
 to
 make
 sure
 his


strangle
 didn't
 go
 into


uh
 did
 didn't
 essentially
 get
 in
 the


money.


And
 so
 it's
 actually
 TJ's
 fault.
 It's


not
 Tanner's
 fault.
 Oh,
 he
 had
 36.
 Ah,


we
 can't
 blame
 TJ
 then.
 We
 had
 plenty
 of


room.
 We
 had
 plenty
 of
 room.
 I
 mean,


this
 thing
 could
 have
 got
 to
 35.
 All
 of


us
 would
 have
 been
 happy
 and
 TJ
 would


have
 been
 having
 no
 issues.


at
 36.
 He
 was
 playing
 it
 safe,
 bro.
 I


thought
 he
 was
 way
 more
 aggressive.


VIX
 is
 up.
 VIX
 is
 green.
 That's
 correct.


Nvidia
 GTC
 is
 not
 live
 yet,
 guys.
 Nvidia


GTC
 is
 at
 12
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong.


Are
 they
 live?
 Oh
 they're
 live.


Jensen.
 Oh
 my
 goodness.
 Jensen's
 here.


Hold
 on.
 Oh,
 and
 Figure.
 Oh,
 holy.
 Hold


on,
 hold
 on,
 hold
 on.


Whoa.
 do
 humanlike
 work
 in
 the
 physical


world.


>> And
 you
 know
 what
 is
 such
 great
 timing?


We're
 talking
 about
 humanoids.
 We're


talking
 about
 the
 collaboration
 with


Nvidia.
 And
 why
 not
 just
 ask
 the
 leader


of
 NVIDIA
 himself
 to
 just
 share
 some


some
 insights.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.
 Yeah,
 good
 to
 see


you.


>> So
 we
 are
 actually
 talking
 about
 job.


Well,
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 AI
 and
 the


concern
 right
 now
 about
 job


displacement.
 And
 I
 know
 that
 you
 are


involved.


>> What's
 everybody
 doing
 here?


>> Watching
 you
 at
 the
 moment.
 That's
 for


sure.
 And
 us,
 right?
 Could
 you
 just


speak
 to
 maybe
 um
 the
 evolution
 right


now
 with
 AI?


>> I
 want
 to
 be
 on
 TV
 with
 Brett.


>> I'm
 gonna
 I'm
 gonna
 get
 to
 why
 we're
 in


DC
 in
 a
 second,
 but
 I
 just
 wanted
 to
 get


your
 insights
 on
 the
 concerns
 about
 the


job
 force
 and
 what
 AI
 efficiencies
 would


mean
 for
 the
 job
 force,
 especially
 right


now
 given
 some
 jobs
 are
 starting
 to
 be


spread
 thin.


>> We
 have
 labor
 shortages
 all
 over
 the


world.
 If
 we
 had
 more
 workers,
 companies


would
 make
 more
 money.
 If
 we
 were


productive,
 more
 productive,
 companies


would
 make
 more
 money.
 When
 we
 make
 more


money,
 we
 invest
 more
 money
 so
 that
 we


hire
 more
 people.
 And
 so,
 it's
 very


likely
 that
 the
 companies
 that
 use
 AI


first,
 that
 use
 robotics
 technology


first,
 will
 be
 the
 most
 successful
 first


and
 then
 we'll
 end
 up
 hiring
 more


people.
 You're
 going
 to
 lose
 your
 jobs


not
 to
 somebody,
 not
 to
 a
 robot.
 You're


going
 to
 lose
 your
 jobs
 to
 somebody
 who


uses
 a
 robot.
 You're
 gonna
 lose
 your


jobs
 to
 somebody
 who
 uses
 AI.
 And
 so,


so,
 uh,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 NVIDIA
 today,
 we


100%
 of
 our
 software
 engineers
 use


Cursor
 100%.
 And
 we're
 hiring
 faster


than
 ever
 because
 we're
 creating
 more


chips
 than
 ever.
 We're
 developing
 more


software
 than
 ever.
 We're
 more


productive
 than
 ever.
 And
 it
 looks
 like


the
 company's
 growing
 faster
 than
 ever.


So,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 great
 things
 that


goes
 along
 with
 being
 productive.
 Nobody


ever
 says,
 you
 know what,
 we
 want
 I
 want


a
 company
 to
 be
 less
 productive.
 I've


never
 heard
 that
 before.
 I've
 never


heard
 somebody
 who's
 who
 well
 if
 you


look
 at
 look
 at
 uh
 companies
 around
 the


world
 about
 what
 is
 it
 70%
 of
 the


companies
 in
 the
 world
 feel
 their
 their


labor
 short
 and
 that
 they
 have
 a
 hard


time
 hanging
 on
 to
 employees
 and
 so
 the


robotics
 is
 going
 to
 really
 help
 that


but
 here
 here's
 the
 thing
 I
 think
 Brett


you're
 on
 to
 something
 huge
 this
 is


likely
 the
 next
 largest
 next
 giant


consumer
 electronics
 market


>> and
 so
 I
 think
 he's
 on
 to
 something.


>> You
 I
 love
 that
 Brett's
 you're
 helping


me
 with
 my
 job.
 See,
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


displaced.


>> I'm
 here
 to
 watch
 him.
 Are
 you
 kidding


me?


>> Can
 you
 speak
 about
 the
 significance
 of


being
 here?


>> Brett
 just
 closed.
 You
 closed
 around.


>> Yeah,
 we
 talked
 about
 it.


>> Figure
 is
 worth
 what?
 3040
 billion


today.


>> Yeah,
 close.


>> 29
 was
 it?
 Or
 30


>> 39
 39
 39
 billion
 through
 here.
 That
 is


impressive.
 And
 congratulations.
 We
 did


talk
 about
 that
 giant
 leap.


>> You're
 a
 whopping
 three-year-old


company.


Three
 and
 a
 half.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 that
 extra
 half
 really
 made


a
 difference.


>> Incredible.


>> Which
 is
 a
 great
 example.


>> Three
 years
 after
 I
 founded
 Nvidia,


Nvidia
 was
 worth
 still
 precisely
 0


billion.


>> Yeah.


>> Perplexity.
 I
 was
 speaking
 to
 the


Perplexity
 CEO.
 Same
 thing.
 Just
 a
 few


years,
 300
 employees,
 valuation
 in
 the


billions,
 too,
 which
 is


>> doing
 great,


>> which
 is
 a
 success
 story
 with
 AI.
 Could


you
 speak
 to
 the
 significance
 about


being
 here
 in
 DC?
 Because
 this
 is
 the


fourth
 GTC.
 Um,
 it's
 a
 different
 groups


of
 people.
 I
 met
 some
 people
 from
 the


military,
 some
 that
 have
 never
 really


they
 don't
 understand
 the
 interconnects


of
 AI,
 quantum,
 forget
 it.
 Can
 you
 speak


to
 why
 we're
 here?


>> The
 technology
 industry
 has
 really


changed.
 You
 know,
 Brett,
 when
 I
 first


started
 the
 company,
 um,
 quite
 frankly,


nobody
 nobody
 cared.
 Nobody
 cared
 about


technology
 companies
 to
 be
 honest.
 and


we're
 just
 we're
 uh
 startups
 in
 Silicon


Valley
 doing
 our
 thing.
 Um
 but
 today


technology
 is
 at
 the
 forefront
 of
 almost


every
 single
 geopolitical
 conversation.


Technology
 is
 obviously
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 industries
 in
 the
 world.
 And


what
 I
 can
 say
 is
 that
 on
 behalf
 of
 and


both
 Brett
 and
 I,
 you
 know,
 have
 the


benefit
 of
 serving
 and
 being
 part
 of
 the


American
 technology
 industry
 that
 I


would
 say
 is
 our
 national
 treasure.
 This


is
 our
 single
 most
 valuable
 industry.


Um,
 unquestionably
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 industries
 in
 the
 world
 and


uh,
 really
 we're
 really
 proud
 to
 be
 part


of
 it
 and
 and
 so
 anyhow,


>> what
 would
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 make
 sure


that
 Washington
 DC
 uh,
 has
 a
 has
 a
 front


row
 seat
 of
 uh,
 what
 NVIDIA
 is
 working


on
 and
 what
 what
 Nvidia
 is
 going
 to
 be


working
 on.
 And
 so
 this
 is
 um,
 GTC


bringing
 GDC
 to
 DC
 is
 really
 exciting


for
 us.
 you
 know,
 doing
 GTC
 at
 our


nation's
 capital.
 Yeah,
 it's
 incredible.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 are
 the
 major


roadblocks?
 Power
 has
 come
 up
 a
 lot
 in


the
 conversation
 and
 it
 seems
 like
 we
 do


have
 a
 lot
 of
 headlines
 building
 out
 x


gigawatts,
 but
 the
 capacity
 to
 to
 build


that
 infrastructure
 is
 is
 a
 roadblock


essentially.
 So,
 what
 do
 you
 say
 to


that?
 That
 maybe
 these
 promises
 uh
 can't


come
 to
 fruition
 in
 the
 near
 term.


>> Uh


cash
 flow
 matters,
 power
 matters.
 Um,


uh,
 land
 power
 and
 shell
 matters,
 power


generator
 matters.
 Uh,
 these
 are
 all


things,
 factories
 matter.
 These
 are
 all


things
 that
 Brent
 and
 I
 think
 about
 all


the
 time.
 And,
 uh,
 his
 business,
 my


business,
 it's
 really
 very
 similar.
 But


it
 comes
 down
 to
 one
 thing
 and
 one
 thing


only,


profitable
 token
 generation.
 The
 moment


we
 have
 intelligence
 that's
 worthy
 of


being
 paid
 for,
 and
 as
 soon
 as
 that


flywheel
 goes,
 then
 everything
 else
 will


take
 care
 of
 itself.
 And
 this
 is
 no


different
 than
 the
 moment
 that
 human


robotics
 starts
 to
 do
 productive
 things


and
 people
 are
 willing
 to
 pay
 for
 it
 and


it's
 a
 profitable
 endeavor,
 then
 you


could
 scale
 up
 as
 large
 as
 you
 want
 to


scale
 up.
 This
 is
 no
 different
 than
 when


TSMC
 in
 the
 old
 days
 manufactured
 the


first
 profitable
 wafer.
 The
 moment
 that


happened,
 they
 could
 build
 up
 as
 the


factories
 as
 large
 they
 want.
 And
 so


that's
 really
 the
 moment
 we're
 looking


for.
 We're
 looking
 for
 that
 virtual


cycle
 where
 AI
 starts
 to
 generate


productive
 tokens,
 profitable
 tokens.


After
 that,
 the
 flywheel
 takes
 off.


>> An
 executive
 at
 another
 company
 told
 me


that
 tokenization
 or
 just
 profits
 per


token
 could
 be
 the
 next
 oil
 and
 and
 for


company
 countries
 all
 around
 the
 globe


really
 focusing
 on
 that
 output.
 Do
 you


kind
 of
 agree
 with
 that
 just
 in
 terms
 of


tokens?
 And
 maybe
 explain
 too
 to
 our


audience
 because
 not
 everybody
 here
 as


is
 as
 advanced.


Computers
 speak
 numbers.
 Tokens
 are


numbers.
 Tokenization,


you
 tokenize.
 We
 tokenize
 almost


everything.
 We
 tokenize
 images,
 words,


uh
 Brett
 tokenizes
 motion,


you
 know,
 a
 sequence
 of
 plans
 that
 a


that
 a
 uh
 that
 a
 robot
 performs.
 And
 so


everything
 that
 we
 can
 tokenize,


AI
 can
 understand.
 So
 if
 we
 can
 tokenize


proteins,
 and
 we
 can
 tokenize
 chemicals,


we
 can
 tokenize
 motions.
 what
 uh
 action


and
 behavior
 all
 these
 things
 that
 Brett


is
 trying
 to
 tokenize.
 We
 tokenize


video,
 we
 tokenize
 3D,
 everything.
 We


tokenize
 uh
 fluid
 dynamics,
 we
 tokenize


anything
 we
 can
 tokenize,
 AI
 can


understand.
 And
 everything
 that
 AI
 can


understand,
 it
 can
 translate.
 It
 can


generate.
 And
 so
 that's
 the
 that
 is
 the


revolution
 that
 we're
 in.
 And
 that's
 why


token
 is
 at
 the
 core
 of
 everything
 that


we
 do.
 And
 ultimately
 what
 we


fundamentally
 do
 is
 to
 transform


electricity
 into
 tokens.
 And
 that
 that's


what
 an
 AI
 factory
 does.


>> We
 come
 full
 circle.
 I've
 been
 told
 that


you
 have
 to
 keep
 going
 so
 we
 keep
 the


show
 on
 the
 on
 on
 because
 you
 have
 a


keynote
 which
 is
 very
 soon.
 Yeah.
 An


hour
 and
 15.
 Jensen,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.


We'll
 see
 you
 soon.
 So
 we'll
 actually


continue
 this
 conversation
 because
 we


did
 interrupt
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 now


you've
 got
 a
 massive
 crowd
 to
 watch
 you.


So
 no
 pressure.
 um


if
 we
 could.


>> Okay,
 so
 we
 got
 some
 Jensen


figure
 conversations.
 I
 think
 this
 GTC


is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 fun
 one,
 dude.
 I
 think


they're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 different


stuff
 that
 potentially
 could
 really
 help


Nvidia,
 help
 the
 broader
 AI
 sector.
 So,


I
 will
 be
 streaming
 it.
 I
 just
 got
 a


text
 from
 Tanner.
 Tanner
 and
 I
 will
 be


streaming
 it
 together.
 Tanner
 and
 I
 will


be
 streaming
 it
 together.
 11:55
 a.m.,
 an


hour
 from
 now,
 Tanner
 and
 I
 will
 be


streaming
 it.
 Uh,
 and
 we'll
 be
 together.


I
 will
 transition
 into
 the
 close.
 Tanner


will
 probably
 leave
 after
 GTC,


but
 we'll
 be
 streaming
 it
 together.
 By


the
 way,
 Sam
 Alman
 just
 tweeted
 that


they're
 going
 to
 do
 a
 live
 stream
 and


answer
 questions
 at
 uh
 10:30
 Pacific.


We're
 going
 to
 talk
 a
 lot
 about
 our
 new


corporate
 structure
 research.
 He
 says,


"On
 the
 structure,
 the
 nonprofit
 remains


in
 control,
 and
 if
 we
 do
 our
 jobs
 well,


we
 will
 be
 the
 best
 resource
 nonprofit


ever.
 We
 are
 excited
 to
 get
 to
 work


immediately
 deploying
 the
 capital."
 I
 am


grateful
 to
 the
 Delaware
 and
 California


Attorney
 Generals,
 our
 partner
 at


Microsoft
 and
 our
 investors,
 especially


to
 our
 tireless
 team
 for
 their
 work
 in


getting
 to
 a
 good
 place
 here.


Okay,


there
 you
 go.
 So,
 Altman
 will
 give
 an


update.
 Dude,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 news


today.
 Altman's
 going
 to
 give
 an
 update


on
 this
 Microsoft
 stuff.
 Microsoft
 just


announced
 the
 new
 corporate


restructuring
 on
 their
 equity
 stake
 and


opening
 eye.
 We're
 going
 to
 get
 more


updates
 from
 Sam
 Alman.
 GTC
 is
 going
 to


happen
 in
 about
 an
 hour.
 Jensen's
 going


to
 be
 potentially
 announcing
 a
 bunch
 of


new
 things.
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 19280.


SoFi
 still
 losing
 29.


PayPal


still
 holding
 a
 10%
 move.


Tesla
 giving
 us
 2%
 and
 then
 the
 broader


S&P
 up
 a
 bit
 on
 the
 day.


Okay,
 there
 you
 go.
 Looks
 like
 uh


looks
 like
 that.
 Oh,
 we
 got
 more
 Jensen.


We
 got
 more
 Jensen.
 Do
 we


>> I
 think
 we
 have
 more
 Jensen.
 Hold
 on.


>> Uh
 solve
 a
 lot
 of
 very
 sticky
 problems,


very
 challenging
 problems
 associated


with
 quantum
 computing
 and
 the
 ecosystem


and
 ourselves
 were
 doing
 some
 amazing


work.
 It
 remains
 incredibly
 hard.
 I


mean,
 the
 work
 you
 guys
 do,
 it's
 deep


science.
 You
 know,
 we
 do
 deep


engineering.
 They
 do
 deep
 science.
 And


and
 so
 so
 I
 I'm
 excited
 about
 the
 work


that
 we're
 doing
 together.
 I
 won't
 I


won't
 I
 won't
 ruin
 it
 by
 telling
 you


guys
 what
 it
 is.
 Um
 but
 but
 um
 this


doesn't
 work.


>> Now
 I
 test
 it.


>> It's
 okay.
 No,
 no.
 This
 this
 is
 about


you
 guys.
 This
 is
 about
 you
 guys.
 And


apparently
 I
 want
 to
 thank
 everybody
 for


coming
 to
 GTC
 in
 Washington
 DC.


>> Yeah.


So
 So
 the
 original
 plan
 I
 just
 I'll
 be


I'll
 be
 honest.
 The
 original
 plan
 was
 uh


President
 Trump
 was
 going
 to
 be
 in


Washington
 DC
 and
 so
 we
 brought
 GTC
 to


Washington
 DC.
 The
 administration's
 all


going
 to
 be
 here
 and
 then
 and
 then
 um
 uh


literally
 two
 days.


Oh
 my
 goodness.
 I'm
 sorry.
 I'm
 sorry.


That
 was
 the
 best
 part
 too.
 That
 was
 the


best
 part.
 I
 was
 closing
 out
 the
 tabs.


No.
 Okay.
 Let
 me
 go
 back.
 Let
 me
 go
 back


to
 when
 he
 said
 that.
 Sorry,
 I'm
 an


amateur.
 I'm
 sorry.


>> I
 just
 I'll
 be
 won't
 ruin
 it
 by
 telling


you
 guys


>> I
 want
 to
 thank
 everybody
 for
 coming.


I
 just
 I'll
 be
 I'll
 be
 honest.
 The


original
 plan
 was
 uh
 President
 Trump
 was


going
 to
 be
 in
 Washington
 DC
 and
 so
 we


brought
 GTC
 to
 Washington
 DC.
 The


administration's
 all
 going
 to
 be
 here
 to


Washington
 DC.
 The
 administration's
 all


going
 to
 be
 here.
 And
 then
 and
 then
 um


uh
 literally
 two
 days
 ago
 uh
 President


Trump
 said,
 "Jensen,
 could
 you
 uh
 be
 in


Korea
 today?"
 And
 I
 said
 I
 said,
 "I


would
 love
 to
 be
 in
 Korea
 today,
 but
 I


came
 to
 vi
 visit
 you
 in
 DC."
 And
 so


anyways,
 we're
 we're
 in
 two
 sides
 of
 the


world.


>> Dude,
 that
 is
 hilarious.
 That
 is


hilarious.
 They
 brought
 GTC
 to
 DC
 so


that
 Trump
 could
 be
 part
 of
 the


experience
 and
 now
 Trump
 asked
 him
 to
 go


to
 Korea.
 That
 is
 a
 wild
 but
 it
 goes
 to


show
 you
 how
 much
 respect
 Jensen
 has
 for


Trump
 that
 he
 brought
 their
 conference


to
 to
 Washington
 DC
 just
 to
 be
 closer
 to


the
 administration
 and
 then


unfortunately
 you
 know
 if
 you're
 the


president
 sometimes
 you
 have
 to
 go
 on


some
 trips.
 Uh
 but
 it
 goes
 to
 show
 the


relationship
 with
 the
 administration


Nvidia
 is
 is
 pretty
 strong.


>> But
 anyhow,
 uh
 he
 wishes
 all
 of
 you


well.
 He
 he's
 he
 gonna
 see
 me
 in
 a
 day


and
 uh
 we're
 going
 to
 we're
 going
 to


we're
 going
 to
 go
 and
 um
 support
 support


the
 president
 uh
 as
 in
 his
 in
 his
 tour


through
 Asia.
 You
 know,
 he's
 our


president.
 We
 want
 him
 to
 be
 enormously


successful
 so
 that
 America
 could
 win
 and


America
 could
 win.
 And
 so
 anyways,
 I


want
 to
 thank
 everybody
 who's
 here


working
 in
 DC.
 Thank
 you
 for
 uh
 thank


you
 for
 your
 service
 and
 thank
 you
 for


coming
 to
 GTC.


>> All
 right,
 great
 to
 see
 you.


>> Take
 care.


>> I
 mean,
 look,
 call
 it
 respect,
 call
 it


kissing
 the
 ring,
 whatever
 you
 want
 to


call
 it.
 Just
 get
 Nvidia
 to
 go
 to
 five


trillion.
 That's
 that's
 what
 most
 of
 us


cares
 care
 about
 here.
 But
 it
 goes
 to


show
 again,
 you
 want
 your
 CEO
 to
 have
 a


good
 relationship
 with
 the


administration.
 And
 it
 looks
 like
 Jensen


has
 tried
 to
 relationship
 with
 Trump.


>> Also,
 we
 got
 those
 rumors
 in
 the
 morning


that
 Trump
 will
 be
 meeting
 Jensen
 later


throughout
 the
 day.
 It
 looks
 like
 Jensen


just
 confirmed
 that
 and
 as
 a
 result,


that's
 what
 you're
 seeing
 right
 here


uh
 from
 GTC
 and
 video
 right
 there
 193


S&P
 500
 at
 686.


Yes,
 if
 this
 unlocks
 China,
 which
 I


don't
 think
 we'd
 get
 the
 update
 today,


but
 if
 Trump
 says,
 "Hey,
 I'm
 meeting


with
 Xi
 in
 five
 days,
 part
 of
 the
 deal


is
 going
 to
 be
 allowing
 Nvidia
 and
 AMD


to
 sell."
 I
 mean,
 Nvidia
 and
 AMD
 could


carry
 the
 S&P
 to
 7,000
 by
 themselves.


Because
 you
 would
 imagine
 like
 a
 minimum


5
 to
 10%
 pump
 once
 China
 is
 officially


allowed
 and
 the
 export
 controls
 are


gone.
 I
 mean,
 we're
 talking
 about


literally,
 I
 think
 for
 Jensen,
 it's


about,
 what
 did
 he
 say?
 Uh
 if
 you
 do
 the


math
 about
 20
 billion
 a
 year
 in
 15
 to
 20


billion
 a
 year
 for
 AMD
 I
 don't
 know
 the


exact
 numbers
 but
 for
 Nvidia


it's
 a
 cool
 15
 20
 billion
 per
 year
 from


China
 which
 would
 be
 very
 important.
 So


getting
 a
 little
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


reversal
 are
 we
 SoFi?
 Yeah
 a
 little
 bit.


2880
 to
 2934.
 So
 it's
 not
 giving
 it
 up


that
 badly
 yet


but
 still
 below
 that
 uh
 that
 $30
 level.


Someone
 bought
 3.4
 4
 million
 on
 Baba


puts
 for
 1121.


Huh.
 Okay.
 Baba's
 had
 a
 great
 year.


Strike
 price
 is
 what?
 167.
 3.4
 million


of
 puts


for
 Baba.


All
 right.
 Cool.
 Good
 stuff.
 I
 will
 be


back
 guys
 at
 11:55
 with
 Tanner
 about
 an


hour
 from
 now.
 S&P
 500
 right
 there
 at


685.
 Pounder
 down
 a
 little bit
 on
 the


day.
 Tesla's
 up.
 Nvidia's
 up.
 Robin


Hoodie
 at
 146.
 You
 got
 AMD
 up
 199.
 And


then
 he
 got
 S&P
 at
 685.
 Tanner
 and
 I


will
 be
 live
 together
 and
 uh
 at
 11:55.
 I


did
 buy
 the
 Amord
 dip.
 I
 just
 bought
 100


shares
 when
 Jensen
 was
 talking.
 So,
 not


a
 crazy
 amount,
 but
 I
 did
 buy
 the
 dip.


Again,
 I
 I
 went
 through
 a
 little
 bit
 of


the
 earnings
 yesterday.
 I
 have
 to
 listen


to
 the
 call
 today.
 This
 is
 a
 stock
 I


feel
 very
 confident
 for
 going
 into
 2026.


It's
 trading
 at
 a
 very
 attractive
 level


and
 everything
 they
 said
 about
 demand
 is


good.
 The
 reason
 it's
 down
 is
 because


the
 CEO
 left
 and
 gross
 margins
 were
 a


little
 bit
 down.
 Gross
 margins
 will


increase.
 the
 CEO
 stepping
 away
 is
 like


whatever.
 The
 the
 person
 who's
 replacing


him
 has
 spent
 20
 years
 at
 the
 company


and
 understands
 the
 operational
 elements


of
 a
 packaging
 company
 in
 the
 United


States.
 So,
 not
 too
 scared
 about
 buying


the
 dip
 on
 that
 one,
 but
 I
 mean
 it's


back
 to
 prices
 that
 it
 was
 back
 on


Friday.
 Now,
 the
 big
 thing
 today
 is


going
 to
 see
 what
 does
 Nvidia
 say?
 What


companies
 do
 they
 announce
 partnerships


with?
 Where
 do
 those
 partnerships


accelerate
 in
 regards
 to
 the
 either


supply
 chain
 of
 semiconductors
 or
 on
 the


other
 broader
 AI
 names
 that
 exist
 in
 the


sector?
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 in
 general,


we
 should
 see
 some
 fun
 announcements


today.
 GTC
 tends
 to,
 you
 know,
 GTC
 tends


to
 preview
 the
 newest
 edition
 of
 their


chips,
 but
 they
 also
 tend
 to
 show
 off


different
 verticals
 that
 they're


entering
 into.
 I
 think
 last
 time
 they


really
 focused
 on
 the
 Cosmos
 platform


with
 humanoid
 robotics
 and
 self-driving.


So,
 all
 that
 stuff
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to


be
 really
 important


and
 uh
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 that
 later


later
 throughout
 the
 day.
 So,
 I'll
 be


back
 11:55.
 I
 will
 transition
 into
 the


market
 close.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 basically


going
 to
 be
 from
 12
 to
 4
 for
 the
 market


close.
 It's
 going to
 be
 a
 busy
 busy
 day.


And
 um
 and
 then
 yeah,
 and
 then
 and
 then


Tanner
 will
 be
 gone
 probably
 at
 like
 2


or
 something.
 And
 um
 and
 then
 we
 will


keep
 going
 from
 there.


So,
 that
 is
 what
 we
 got.
 Uh
 Amit's


dentist,
 thank
 you
 again
 for
 the
 $20


super
 chat.
 So,
 Jensen's
 out
 here


challenging
 your
 dentist.
 I'll
 be


waiting
 in
 my
 lab
 coat.
 This
 is
 going
 to


be
 a
 daily
 thing
 at
 this
 point.
 This
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 daily
 thing,
 but
 it
 is


what
 it
 is.
 It
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 Falling


knife,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $200
 super


chat.
 Appreciate
 you,
 man.
 Thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 $200
 super


chat.
 Johan,
 thank
 you
 for
 becoming
 a


channel
 member.
 Scott,
 thank
 you
 for


becoming
 a
 channel
 member.
 Appreciate


you
 guys.
 Um,
 we'll
 be
 back
 at
 12.
 We'll


see
 what
 we
 got
 on
 GTC.
 We're
 not
 having


technical
 Tuesday
 today
 because
 we
 have


a
 lot
 of
 earnings.
 Also,
 again,
 it's


really
 hard
 to
 do
 technicals
 on


companies
 that
 are
 about
 to
 report.
 So,


it
 it'll
 be
 a
 shorter
 market
 close


today.
 We'll
 probably
 end
 around
 like


4:30,
 4:45,
 but
 we'll
 get
 through
 Visa,


Cheesecake,
 a
 bunch
 of
 these
 companies


that
 have
 earnings
 and
 uh
 we'll
 see
 what


Jensen
 has
 to
 say.
 Yeah,
 last
 time
 was
 a


lot
 of
 emphasis
 on
 Blackwell.
 So,
 I


think
 maybe
 Vera
 Rubin
 is
 going
 to
 get
 a


decent
 amount
 of
 focus
 at
 GTC,


but
 we'll
 find
 out
 at
 12
 PM
 and
 see
 what


they


what
 they
 say.
 Yeah,
 it's
 Tanner


Tuesday.
 Exactly.
 Uh
 word
 of
 the
 day.


All right,
 let's
 do
 that
 and
 then
 we'll


be
 done.


for
 at least
 the
 next
 hour.


Um,


okay.
 Word
 of
 the
 day.


Uh,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 this
 word
 is.


Zafer.


A
 soft,
 gentle
 breeze
 often
 used


poetically
 to
 describe
 something
 light,


airy,
 or
 fleeting.
 A
 warm
 zafer
 drifted


through
 the
 open
 window
 carrying
 the


scent
 of
 rain
 and
 jasmine.


Okay,


I
 think
 the
 actual
 word
 of
 the
 day


should
 be
 AGI
 given
 Microsoft
 has
 talked


about
 it
 extensively,
 but
 there
 you
 go.


Zafer.
 Dude,
 there's
 no
 way
 in
 hell
 I'm


mispronouncing
 that.
 That
 is
 just
 not


There's
 Hold
 on.
 There
 is
 no
 way
 in
 hell


I'm
 mispronouncing
 that.


It's
 Zafer.


>> Zephyr.


All
 right,
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys
 at
 12
 p.m.


Bye-bye.


Bye-bye.
