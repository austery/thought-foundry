There is this famous Google interview
question that everyone gets wrong.
You're shrunk down to the size of a nickel
and put into a blender.
The blades will start spinning in 60 seconds,
so what do you do?
I would like to think I could duck down
and miss the blades
Break the thing at the bottom maybe?
Push the blades?
Ask nicely for the blender
not to be turned on.
Tie my clothes together, and then like
use it as a rope I guess?
If I was lighter I could maybe catch a draft up?
- Just accept defeat.
- I mean, I'm the size of a nickel
what quality of life is that?
Okay, resonance.
I'm going to run to one wall,
push on it, run to the other wall. Push on it.
Run to the other wall, so
I'm going to tip the container over.
Honestly, the thing I would think about
is trying to get to the very center
of the blades.
It's spinning around me, but
the actual RPM is probably not that high,
if I'm standing in the middle.
I tie my clothes to one of the tips
of the blades as it’s starting up.
Yeah, I get it to swing
me around and then I woooo!
But these answers don't cut it.
Now, I first heard about this problem
in this book.
It describes how each year Google received
about 3 million applications,
but they would only hire 7000 people.
That's a 0.2% acceptance rate.
So one way to screen out
millions of applicants was to use brainteasers,
and the interviewers
would make these up for fun.
We didn't get a list, at that time of
what questions to ask.
We would share questions among each other.
Some of them gained traction,
questions like:
How many golf balls can fit in a 747?
Or, how much should you charge
to wash all the windows in Seattle?
But the blender question
really stuck with me, and I'm not alone.
- Just lay back and enjoy that breeze.
The best model in the world is only going to
run maybe 10 or 11 hours,
so we're getting out and when we do, we're better off for it because whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
- The question has been hotly debated
in Reddit comment sections.
There are so many different answers,
but which one is the best?
I try to hide underneath the blades,
I guess.
Hide under the blade, probably
Great first reaction,
but maybe that doesn't solve your problem
entirely.
Now you're just stuck inside of a spinning
blender, so maybe you want to escape.
Can I climb the walls?
Are there defects in the walls that are
sufficiently large for me to grip on to?
Do I have Van der Waals forces that are
strong enough to connect me to the wall?
Am I, like, essentially a tiny gecko?
A gecko can stick
to the wall of a blender,
even though neither its foot, nor
the glass are charged.
The gecko's foot has to be pressed
firmly against the glass,
so its atoms are within a few nanometers
of the glass atoms.
Then, at any moment one atoms electrons
aren't uniformly spread about the nucleus,
they might be slightly more on one
side than the other.
This makes the atom momentarily
slightly positively charged
on one side and slightly
negatively charged on the other.
The glass atom next to it experiences
the pull of this charge imbalance,
and so a similar charge
imbalance is induced on the glass atom,
and therefore the electrons in the glass
atom are drawn
to the nucleus of the gecko
atom, and vice versa.
So there is a very weak attractive force
between neutral atoms.
This is known as a Van der Waals force,
and it's what makes geckos stick to walls.
It's the same force
that holds graphite together.
There's no actual bonding between
the layers of graphene in a pencil.
It's like a stack of paper.
The layers only stick because of Van
der Waals forces.
Now these forces are pretty weak.
But since we're so small, maybe
they'd be enough to help us climb out.
This I can almost certainly say,
we wouldn't be sticking at that scale,
and that's because the Van der Waals
type interactions are still small.
And I studied climbing, so that of these types of
scale, cockroach and gecko, you know,
it turns out that you have to get
very special to do that.
Geckos have millions of tiny
branches on their feet that increase
their surface area
and allow them to mold to surfaces.
Our hands aren't like that,
but ants and cockroaches
don't rely on Van der Waals forces,
and they can still climb up walls.
So maybe a miniature human could too?
The mechanism of a cockroach foot,
and I used to know all that
cockroach feet, is absolutely gorgeous,
Same with an ant, by the way.
There's two little claws, the tarsal claws
those are things
that slap down on a surface and really do slap
when climbing meters a second... slap and
engage, despite having no adhesion,
they have very sophisticated,
frictional attachment.
Those claws can grip almost anything,
even glass. 
While glass feels smooth to us,
It's actually covered in tiny surface
imperfections.
At insect scale,
these features are significant.
- Ants basically have climbing gear.
- Oh yeah.
They're like, using these little
like axes basically to pick their way in.
We don't have the attachment disks
or whatever that would be,
or like the special claws
or the Van der Waals forces.
Well, we have claws, if you're that scale,
our fingers are claws.
We have only really got... we have
two claws, really.
And then our feet
aren't great at climbing, I don't know.
Well, again, at that scale though,
I don't know, right?
Imagine putting a little sharp, spike into your foot
and sharpen your
shoes, wear high heel shoes.
You'll be good to go.
So now I'm climbing in heels.
But there's still a problem.
I mean, I'll have to be pretty careful
placing each hand and foot slowly.
It's going to take longer
than 60 seconds to get out.
And in that time,
the blades will have started spinning.
One mistake and I'm a smoothie.
So Google was looking
for a different answer.
Now we’re going to the physics building.
Maybe they know?
Yeah. I really got nothing. I’m stumped.
This is so embarrassing.
We’re in our last year of our degree, we should
definitely know this!
I feel like I could probably swing running
around the sides and yeeting myself out.
Okay, if we're just talking about the entropy,
it should increase at some point.
So some sort of chaos should be...
None of the system will stay un-disrupted...
Take that as a limit to infinity
and I'll be chilling...
Like using that logic
if I just like extrapolate...
Now that's still too big for me
to Quantum Tunnel or anything like that.
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
I mean, that is really overthinking it.
It's actually not that complicated.
- Do you want to hear the best answer I've heard yet?
- Sure.
Just jump.
Just jump?
How would that work?
- Just jump!
- How?
-Does that work like that?
- Jump where? 
- Out of the blender, just go up.
- So whoever told you that is...  
- ...crazy, right?
Yeah, does that makes sense to you?
No, it doesn't, but...
do you want to hear why that works?
Yeah, tell me how it works.
Jumping out of a blender seems impossible
because at nickel size,
the wall of a blender is 15x
your height.
It'd be like leaping over an eight story building.
But watch these clips...
Did you notice it?
A horse, a dog and a squirrel.
They all jump to about the same height.
This is exactly what Alfonso Borrelli,
the father of biomechanics,
looked at in the 17th century.
As he put it, in the same conditions,
smaller and lighter animals
make bigger jumps relative to their body.
if the other conditions are equal,
and indeed the limbs and the other organs
are in the same proportion,
the dog will jump as far as the horse.
Now, sure, there is variation.
A species whose survival depends on
jumping will be optimized for it,
while others, like turtles and elephants,
they don't jump at all.
But when you consider the huge variations
in size,
I mean a horse is 1500 times
heavier than a squirrel.
It's incredible that they jump to
around the same height.
And it's not because squirrels
are super muscly or something.
Horses and squirrels have similar muscle
to weight percentages,
and insects have even less muscle
relative to their weight.
Why do you think an ant can lift
50 times its own body weight?
Like, is it any more muscular? No
you guys hit the gym.
Come on. Like
you're more muscular than an ant.
So how are small things so strong?
Well if you look closely at a muscle. It’s made up of tiny units called sarcomeres.
They act like miniature springs.
How far a muscle compresses depends on
how many of these springs are in series.
But the strength of a muscle depends
only on how many are working in parallel.
The thicker the muscle, the more springs
in parallel, and the greater the strength.
Therefore strength depends
on the cross-sectional area of a muscle.
And as animals shrink,
this cross-sectional area
scales down
with the square of their height.
But an animal's weight
is proportional to its volume,
so that scales
with the cube of their height.
So as you scale down, weight decreases
faster than strength,
and as a result, smaller animals have much
higher strength to weight ratios.
I mean, you could probably lift, 
your own weight,
like if you were to put your own body
weight on your back and squat that, you could now lift... 
100 hundred times.
Yeah. Let's go!
And for us, stuck in that blender,
that extra strength
relative to our weight
means we could jump right out.
Your surface area
decreases with the square.
You'd be like a little superman.
- I see, okay!
- That's really cool.
So I could jump, like,
literally out of a blender.
You could jump out of a blender.
But in movies and games
where people are shrunk,
they almost never show it like that.
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids It was one of my favorite movies
when I was a kid.
I loved that.
Tiny people struggle picking up scissors.
They almost get crushed by raindrops.
If it was scientifically accurate, they’d actually be overpowered. 
Most people don't think of this
when they first hear the question.
The answer almost seems too simple.
When you ask the right questions,
you define the problem.
There's some really obvious solutions
that work, and that's
actually true for a lot of problems
in the real world too.
Now I'm all for obvious solutions,
but from the start,
the answer of jumping out
didn't sit right with me.
Even this idea of like, I'm
going to jump out of the blender like that
doesn't make sense to me,
because jumping is not just like,
okay, how strong
you are relative to your weight.
It's also timing
and your kinetics and all that.
So like, how long can you be in
touch with the ground?
How much can you apply that force in
one burst like over a really short period?
Would it be
fair to say you're overthinking things?
You got to suspend your disbelief
somewhere.
I think if you like, factor in all the
potential challenges a human would have.
Just like if they just all of a sudden
that size, they don't have
like time to practice using their legs
and stuff in that new environment.
Like, I don't give them very good
chances of jumping out.
Sometimes there are people
who make everything more complex
than it needs to be,
and that can be problematic.
I would like to see like,
you know, realistic modeling of,
we scale me down 100 times.
Like, can I jump higher?
I want to see someone do
those physics equations, yeah,
you could jump higher, but you couldn’t jump
100x higher, you know?
So that's why we got the researchers
at Georgia Tech's biomechanics lab to investigate.
While, they're figuring that out,
let me tell you about today's
sponsor, Incogni.
Every time you browse the internet,
sign up for a newsletter, or even just buy
something online.
Your personal data is collected,
it is stored.
And sometimes sold

So how do you escape?
Well, with your permission, Incogni
contacts data brokers on your behalf
and requests using proper legal language
that they delete
your personal information.
So instead of spending countless hours
trying to track these companies
down yourself, Incogni
does all that hard work for you.
I started using Incogni
and within just a week
my inbox was less overrun
and my phone even got fewer spam calls.
After a month,
my dashboard showed even more removals.
Companies I had never
even interacted with, but who
somehow had my personal information.

Now let's see how that
simulation is coming along.
Okay, so we have our simulated blender.
We’re 2 centimeters tall and we have to jump at least 30 centimeters to get out.
I was like, well, what about me?
Like, I'm pretty,
you know, embarrassingly non-athletic.
What if I do this? So I did it right here
next to my desk.
My partner sort of measured my jump height,
and I know how much I weigh
and all that stuff.
So what would it look like for me?
If we have a person
that weighs 84kg, is squatting
15cm and has a jump height of 27cm.
That person, if they were scaled down
to 1% of their original size,
they would jump 42cm high.
The simple simulation
shows a jump height of 42cm.
So you would make it out.
But we need to add in air resistance.
Since our cross-sectional area is now
100 times larger relative to our weight,
drag should have a greater effect
at nickel size.
If it was 42cm jump height
before for the jumper, with drag...
considering drag, then it's about 39cm.
So we do decrease in jump height a little bit.
But that drag calculation
is assuming you jump perfectly vertically.
But what if you're a bit uncoordinated
and you flip onto your side mid jump?
Well, then you're exposing
ten times the surface area
and that increases
the amount of air resistance.
Like if somehow you flipped,
and you're still moving up like this.
Like what is the air resistance then?
So doing that,
that means 22 centimeter jump height.
Oh. So we don't we don't.
Oh. Darn.
If you start getting overconfident
and you wanted to do,
like, a backflip while you're at it,
then you're going to mess it up. Yeah.
Don't backflip out of the blender 
is a good piece of advice.
Don't try and show off.
You're trying to not get chopped up.
Just like, just go headfirst.
It's not so much getting out
of the blender.
It's what happens next.
You've got two nickel sized men free
in the world. Think of the posibilities.
The simulation came back, 
You can jump out of the freaking blender.
Alright, okay.
I'm glad we went through this,
this exercise.
Do you want me to do another month
of research on this?
No. You know, like you've done it.
You've done enough.
You've done enough. I'm convinced.
I feel like jumping is
an unsatisfactory answer.
It was unsatisfactory
when you mentioned it in the first place.
And you went through
and you got the simulation,
you got the model, and you're like, look,
you know, our little guy can jump 40cm.
Are you convinced now?
And I'm like, I guess.
But like, my spidey sense was tingling.
- Oh was it now!
- There is something going on...
You're telling me
that I have to apply a force
in 1/1000 of a second,
and I have to undergo
278 G's?
I'm not going to survive that.
So what I'm getting now is that, like,
my intuition was good.
I think everyone's intuition was like,
you can't jump out of a blender.
I think they're right.
And you may say,
well, that's overthinking it,
but that's the whole point of the brain
teaser is to overthink it is to get to
that point where you're thinking about it
in the detail of like,
what would actually be feasible.
A whole lot of things would go wrong.
Our hearts have to generate
a certain amount of pressure
to get the blood, you know, going up
to our head and going all the way down.
If you take the human heart
and shrink it down,
it's not going to be able
to generate the same kinds of forces.
I think it would be a catastrophe,
in a smaller size. Controlling
air pressure inside these countless sacks
inside of our lungs.
There's an exquisite balance there.
Now, you try to take that same design
and squeeze it down.
I would be skeptical that you'd be able
to keep the passageways open.
You wouldn't even be able
to think this through, because you just
wouldn't have the brain structures that we have.
You can't fit 86 billion neurons in a nickel sized volume.
You can't scale cells down either.
That's the thing. Like cells are cells.
I mean, jumping out would be, to me,
seems like your only option, but I don't
think you're going to be able to jump
because you can't breathe
and your heart can't pump blood,
so you just keel over and die
before you can make your jump.
Okay, so if you're a biologist,
you think we die.
If you're a physicist, you can decide
whether we'd be little supermen or,
as I believe, incapable
of fully harnessing our extra strength.
What did Borelli know?
He didn't even have blenders.
He doesn't know the stress.
But if you're an interviewer at Google,
you might not even care what the answer is.
I think one of the misconceptions
that candidates have is
when I'm asked this question, it's
because they want to see
if I can solve this problem.
That's actually not quite right.
There are five attributes
people are looking for.
There's addressing ambiguity,
There's breaking down the problem,
being creative, being smart,
and then communication.
- So I guess like none of those five are
whether it's correct.
- Right. 
We’re the idiots who went
and tried to figure out what's the best
of those answers.
Um, yes!
Google realized that asking these types of questions
didn't make much sense.
Laszlo Bock, the senior vice president
of people operations at Google, said this:
On the hiring side, we found that brain
teasers are a complete waste of time.
How many golf balls
can you fit into an airplane?
How many gas stations are in Manhattan?
A complete waste of time.
They don't predict anything.
They serve primarily
to make the interviewer feel smart.
But I just feel like there's that moment
where you're like,
so are you going to admit you're wrong?
And I'm like, nyah, you know, I think
this is further to like, I'm not wrong.
This is crazy.
This question is crazy.
And I think it goes to your very point.
Your very point,
which is that like brain teasers like this
are not good ways to assess whether people
know what they're talking about.
So although brain teasers aren't useful
to assess
job applicants,
they are useful for something.
I mean, every time we ask this question
to people on the street,
to physics students and to scientists,
they lit up.
They had to try to see the world
from a new perspective.
And it's exactly this way of thinking
that has led to
some of the biggest scientific
discoveries.
Einstein used thought experiments
to come up with his theory of relativity.
Euler's solution
to the bridges of Königsberg puzzle
is what inspired graph theory.
And when Schrödinger wanted to illustrate
his problems with quantum mechanics,
he imagined a cat in a torture box.
The blender question is admittedly silly,
but silly
questions can yield profound answers
and show us new things.
I think in order to learn something new,
you have to be willing
to embrace the ridiculous
and just go with it.
