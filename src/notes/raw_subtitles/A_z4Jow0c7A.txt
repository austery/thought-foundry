Hi
 everyone,
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangan,
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth


Fund
 and
 today
 I'm
 in
 really
 good


company
 with
 Vas
 Narasiman,
 the
 CEO
 of


Novartis.
 Vas
 has
 one
 of
 the
 most


fascinating
 backgrounds
 in
 pharma.
 He
 is


a
 trained
 physician
 who
 also
 worked
 on


the
 front
 lines
 fighting
 tuberculosis


and
 malaria
 in
 developing
 countries


before
 rising
 to
 lead
 one
 of
 the
 world's


largest
 pharmaceutical
 companies.
 Uh
 we


own
 2.3%
 of
 Novartis
 and
 that's
 worth


more
 than
 $5
 billion.
 Roughly
 10,000


Norwegian
 growner
 per
 Norwegian
 citizen.


So
 Vas
 big
 thanks
 for
 joining
 us.
 Great


to
 be
 here
 Niclay.
 Um
 just
 uh
 briefly
 to


uh
 kick
 off
 for
 those
 who
 are
 not


familiar
 with
 Novartis
 in
 10
 seconds


just
 what
 are
 your
 areas
 of
 focus?
 Yeah,


we're
 one
 of the
 largest


biioharmaceutical
 companies
 uh
 in
 the


world
 focused
 on
 innovative
 medicines
 in


oncology,


cardiovascular
 disease,
 neuroscience
 and


in
 imunological
 diseases.
 Very
 good.
 And


we'll
 come
 back
 to
 uh
 to
 many
 of
 those.


Um
 now
 you
 have
 a
 different
 background


uh
 compared
 to
 many
 of
 the
 pharma
 CEOs.


How
 do
 you
 think
 that
 has
 shaped
 your


approach
 to
 approach
 to
 leading


Novartis?
 Well,
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 it's


helped
 in
 many
 dimensions.
 I
 mean
 being


coming
 coming
 from
 uh
 being
 a
 physician


coming
 from
 a
 scientific
 background
 I'm


definitely
 steeped
 in
 the
 R&D
 elements


of
 the
 work
 we
 do.
 So
 I'm
 always


thinking
 about
 the
 medicine
 how
 the


medicines
 impact
 patients
 very
 data


driven
 always
 thinking
 about
 how
 these


medicines
 might
 fit
 into
 clinical


practice.
 And
 given
 that
 the
 core
 of


what
 a
 biioharmaceutical
 company
 does
 is


find
 breakthrough
 innovations
 that


matter
 for
 patients
 in
 the
 long
 run
 I


think
 it's
 a
 really
 helpful
 background.


You
 know,
 I
 had
 to
 learn
 a
 lot
 about


business.
 I
 didn't
 go
 to
 business


school.
 I
 had
 to
 learn
 all
 of
 the
 ins


and
 outs
 of
 capital
 allocations
 and


balance
 sheets,
 P&Ls,
 running


businesses.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 combination


of
 a
 medical
 background
 and
 business


background
 has
 served
 me
 well.
 Yeah,


absolutely.
 Absolutely.
 Well,
 to
 be


frank,
 uh
 business
 is
 is
 not
 so


difficult
 compared
 to
 medicine.
 So,
 I


think
 you
 you
 know
 the
 right
 things.


Now,
 you
 were
 you
 were
 running
 the
 uh


the
 R&D
 efforts
 at
 Novartis
 before


taking
 over
 as
 a
 CEO.
 So
 when
 you
 um


when
 you
 took
 over
 what
 kind
 of
 changes


did
 you
 implement?
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 the


biggest
 change
 that
 we
 we
 to
 we
 took
 on


was
 to
 focus
 the
 the
 company
 and
 the


idea
 was
 our
 best
 uh
 our
 best
 elements


of
 Novartis
 were
 in
 our
 R&D
 engine


finding
 breakthrough
 medicines
 that
 that


move
 the
 needle
 on
 a
 range
 of
 of


different
 diseases.
 At
 the
 time
 we
 were


a
 sprawling
 conglomerate
 and
 we
 had


areas
 like
 consumer
 health,
 generics,
 uh


we
 were
 in
 eye
 care
 and
 eye
 devices
 with


the
 alcon
 business.
 And
 so
 the
 idea
 was


to
 focus
 as
 a
 pure
 play
 innovative


medicines
 company.
 Now
 it
 took
 a
 lot


longer
 than
 than
 I
 expected
 uh
 to
 make


that
 all
 happen.
 It
 took
 around
 five
 six


years
 of
 spinning
 businesses.
 So
 we
 did


uh
 we
 we
 got
 rid
 of
 our
 consumer
 or


moved
 out
 of
 our
 consumer
 health


business.
 We
 spun
 Alcon,
 spun
 Sandos,
 uh


sold
 our
 Ro
 steak.
 And
 what's
 incredible


to
 me
 now
 when
 you
 look
 at
 our
 company,


our
 market
 cap
 is
 235
 billion.
 When
 you


add
 back
 all
 of
 those
 companies
 that
 we


put
 out
 uh
 into
 the
 public
 markets,
 you


add
 another
 almost
 100
 billion
 to
 that


market
 cap.
 So
 in
 the
 end,
 we
 really


unlocked
 a
 lot
 of
 value
 by
 focusing.
 In


the
 old
 days,
 you
 could
 argue
 that
 you


had
 some
 really
 stable
 revenue
 streams


which
 kind
 of
 offset
 uh
 patent
 cliffs


and
 so
 on.
 Now
 you
 are
 as
 more
 a
 a
 pure


streamlined
 farmer
 company.
 What
 does


that
 do
 to
 the
 attitudes
 in
 the
 company?


I
 mean
 it
 it
 there
 was
 this
 belief
 that


if
 you
 had
 these
 more
 stable
 businesses


that
 you
 could
 offset
 the
 peaks
 and


valleys
 of
 R&D
 productivity
 in
 our


industry
 because
 naturally
 we
 have
 large


patent
 cliffs
 uh
 and
 we
 have
 to
 manage


through
 those
 patent
 cliffs.
 But


actually
 what
 we
 found
 is
 something
 else


was
 happening.
 a
 lot
 of
 distraction
 and


inability
 to
 allocate
 capital
 to
 where


we
 found
 the
 most
 likely
 impact
 and
 the


most
 most
 value.
 So
 in
 the
 end,
 you


know,
 we're
 appropriately
 diversified


within
 biioharmaceuticals.
 We're
 in


different
 technology
 platforms
 and
 we


invest
 a
 lot.
 I'm
 sure
 we'll
 talk
 about


these
 advanced
 technology
 platforms.


We're
 diversified
 in
 therapeutic
 areas,


but
 being
 diversified
 across
 business


lines
 just
 diluted
 our
 our
 effort.
 Uh


and
 in
 the
 end,
 it's
 really
 interesting


if
 you
 look
 at
 Novartis'
 history.
 We've


actually
 managed
 through
 all
 of
 our


patent
 experies,
 major
 patent
 experts,


not
 because
 we
 had
 these
 other


businesses,
 but
 because
 our
 innovation


engine
 actually
 delivered
 the
 next
 wave


of
 breakthroughs.
 So,
 in
 a
 sense,
 we


have
 to
 bet
 on
 ourselves.
 Play
 to
 win


and
 not
 play
 not
 to
 lose.
 Do
 you
 think


you
 structure
 your
 R&D
 differently
 uh


compared
 to
 other
 pharma
 companies?
 You


know,
 we
 do
 do
 some
 things
 that
 that
 are


different.
 I
 mean
 we
 have
 a
 function


called
 strategy
 uh
 and
 growth
 which
 we


you
 know
 created
 uh
 a
 few
 years
 back.


It's
 run
 by
 a
 wonderful
 former
 Wall


Street
 analyst
 from
 from
 Bernstein
 but


has
 built
 a
 a
 whole
 team
 together
 that


relentlessly
 looks
 at
 the
 outside
 world


really
 brings
 in
 those
 insights
 and


challenges
 even
 early
 stage
 researchers


on
 is
 what
 they're
 doing
 really
 going
 to


move
 the
 needle
 for
 for
 clinical
 care.


So
 we
 bring
 those
 outside
 insights
 even


into
 the
 earliest
 stages
 of
 of
 R&D.
 We


also
 radically
 focused
 and
 that's


something
 Novartis
 already
 always
 was


not
 really
 good
 at.
 I
 mean
 we
 were
 in


far
 too
 many
 therapeutic
 areas
 too


diluted
 and
 what
 we
 did
 is
 we
 focused
 on


four
 therapeutic
 areas
 cut
 out
 a
 lot
 of


the
 other
 areas
 and
 then
 really
 built
 on


the
 deep
 expertise
 and
 of
 our
 people.
 I


think
 that's
 really
 um
 delivered


delivered
 results.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 now


the
 question
 is
 how
 we
 can
 use
 AI
 and


other
 technologies
 to
 to
 get
 an
 edge
 on


our
 peer
 set.
 I'd
 say
 the
 one
 other


thing
 that
 we
 do
 that's
 unique
 is
 we


invest
 in
 these
 technology
 platforms.


We're
 the
 world
 leader
 in
 radolyan


therapies,
 the
 world
 leader
 in
 cell
 and


gene
 therapies,
 one
 of
 the
 world
 leaders


in
 RNA
 therapeutics.
 And
 that's
 a
 belief


that
 you
 have
 to
 keep
 investing
 at
 the


cutting
 edge
 of
 science
 to
 lead
 in
 the


long
 run.
 So
 if
 you
 think
 about
 where


this
 industry
 will
 be
 in
 2035,
 you
 have


to
 keep
 investing
 in
 these
 leading
 edge


technologies
 so
 that
 you're
 ahead
 of
 the


curve.
 If
 you
 were
 to
 rank
 uh
 your


therapeutic
 areas
 according
 to


attractiveness,
 how
 would
 you
 how
 would


you
 stack
 him?
 That's
 a
 tough
 one.
 And


uh
 of
 course
 uh
 there
 there's
 no


different
 metrics
 I
 think
 you
 you
 would


you
 would
 use.
 I
 mean
 clearly
 each
 one


of
 these
 areas
 has
 different
 dynamics.
 I


mean
 in
 cardiovascular
 disease,
 you're


looking
 at
 large-scale
 population
 health


topics
 and
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to


better
 tackle
 heart
 disease
 and
 related


cardiovascular
 conditions
 at
 scale.
 In


neuroscience,
 we're
 very
 focused
 on


neurodeenerative
 diseases
 and


genetically
 driven
 diseases.
 These
 are


much
 more
 focused
 areas
 where
 you're


really,
 you
 know,
 mining
 the
 mysteries


of
 of
 the
 mind.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 immunology


has
 a
 whole
 set
 of
 different
 challenges.


So,
 it's
 not
 easy
 to
 to
 rank.
 I
 I
 really


like
 to
 think
 that
 we
 need
 to
 be
 strong


in
 all
 of
 these
 these
 four
 areas.
 It
 it


does
 bring
 to
 mind
 an
 important
 tangent


though
 that
 that
 I
 think
 we
 always
 have


to
 remind
 ourselves
 when
 we
 think
 about


R&D
 uh
 in
 our
 sector.
 I
 mean
 what
 we
 do


is
 remarkably
 hard.
 I
 mean
 when
 you


think
 about
 it
 we
 are
 trying
 to
 unpack


two
 billion
 years
 of
 evolution
 of
 cells


and
 these
 processes
 that
 happen
 in


multisellular
 organisms
 and
 to
 find
 a


single
 drug
 target
 and
 then
 actually


drug
 that
 target
 so
 that
 it
 impacts
 the


human
 body
 in
 effective
 way
 is
 an


incredibly
 daunting
 enterprise
 and
 the


fact
 that
 we
 do
 it
 at
 all
 I
 like
 to
 tell


our
 people
 it's
 a
 miracle
 that
 fits
 in


the
 palm
 of
 your
 hands.
 It's
 a
 miracle


we
 do
 this
 at
 all,
 much
 less
 doing
 this


multiple
 times
 over
 200
 200
 years.
 So
 I


think
 it's
 always
 important
 to
 remind


oneself
 of
 how
 hard
 it
 is
 to
 do
 the
 work


we
 do
 in
 each
 one
 of
 these
 therapeutic


areas
 or
 the
 modalities
 that
 we
 work
 in.


Well,
 we
 we're
 living
 in
 a
 we
 living
 at


a
 time
 where
 there
 are
 more
 miracles


than
 uh
 than
 normal
 because
 of
 uh
 the


way
 science
 is
 moving,
 right?
 So
 when


you
 look
 at
 um
 everything
 you
 you
 are


involved
 with
 what
 are
 the
 most


significant
 scientific
 uh
 breakthroughs


on
 the
 horizon
 that
 you
 are
 excited


about?
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 a
 couple


things
 and
 and
 they
 range
 across
 a
 whole


spectrum.
 I
 I
 think
 on
 the
 on
 one
 part


in
 terms
 of
 population
 health,
 our


ability
 to
 intervene
 earlier
 and
 earlier


in
 disease
 to
 hopefully
 prevent
 diseases


from
 even
 getting
 to
 late
 later
 stages
 I


think
 will
 be
 incredibly
 important.
 uh


demography
 in
 the
 world
 is
 is
 only


getting
 more
 challenging.
 Huge
 aging


populations,
 health
 care
 systems
 under


strain,
 uh
 not
 enough
 young
 people


always
 with
 the
 fertility
 rate
 falling


to
 actually
 fund
 these
 healthare


systems.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to


prevent
 disease.
 And
 our
 experience
 is,


you
 know,
 you
 can
 go
 earlier.
 We're


working
 very
 hard
 to
 find
 how
 can
 you


intervene
 earlier
 and
 earlier
 in
 various


cancers.
 We
 just
 had
 another
 important


data
 set
 in
 prostate
 cancer
 intervening


early.
 And
 the
 idea
 is
 how
 how
 can
 you


intervene
 so
 that
 the
 the
 cancer
 doesn't


get
 to
 a
 stage
 where
 ultimately
 it


requires
 hospitalizations.
 So
 I
 think


early
 intervention
 is
 a
 is
 a
 huge
 area


of
 focus.
 I
 think
 another
 exciting
 area


clearly
 is
 the
 idea
 of
 can
 you


completely
 reset
 diseases.
 This
 all


comes
 out
 of
 the
 world
 of
 cell
 and
 gene


therapies
 where
 we
 already
 learned
 that


for
 certain
 genetic
 diseases
 and


Novartis
 is
 one
 of
 the
 leaders
 here.


we're
 able
 to
 almost
 deliver
 a
 cure
 or
 a


dramatic
 response
 by
 using
 the
 gene


therapies
 to
 actually
 replace
 a
 gene
 in


the
 body.
 So
 now
 what
 we've
 learned
 and


there's
 actually
 data
 coming
 out
 just


this
 week
 that
 you
 can
 actually
 use
 cell


therapy
 to
 reset
 the
 immune
 system.
 And


there's
 a
 whole
 range
 of
 imunological


diseases
 that
 are
 very
 severe
 affecting


young
 people
 and
 old
 people.
 And
 the


idea
 here
 is
 with
 these
 therapies
 using


cell
 therapy
 you
 can
 reset
 the
 immune


system
 and
 turn
 back
 the
 clock
 on
 their


disease
 by
 15
 or
 20
 years.
 And
 so
 this


is
 I
 think
 a
 staggering
 innovation
 that


will
 change
 the
 lives
 of
 you
 know


hopefully
 over
 time
 millions
 and


millions
 of
 people.
 Another
 area
 I'm


very
 excited
 about
 is
 an
 area
 called
 RNA


therapeutics
 that
 allows
 you
 to
 give


medicines
 that
 you
 usually
 take
 every


day.
 You
 only
 need
 to
 take
 them
 every


six
 months
 or
 maybe
 once
 a
 year.
 And


most
 people
 don't
 take
 their


preventative
 statins
 or
 other
 medicines.


So
 if
 we
 can
 get
 to
 infrequently
 uh


administered
 therapies,
 that
 would
 be


incredibly
 exciting
 as
 well.
 And
 if


you'll
 indulge
 me,
 just
 one
 other
 I
 I


think
 is
 super
 exciting
 is
 is


radioarmaceuticals
 or
 radolyan
 therapy


where
 Novartis
 is
 a
 pioneer
 here.
 What


we've
 learned
 is
 we
 know
 radiation
 can


can
 attack
 tumors
 and
 and
 stop
 tumors


from
 growing
 or
 even
 eliminate
 tumors.


But
 now
 we
 can
 micro
 basically
 target


radiation
 right
 to
 where
 the
 tumor
 is
 in


the
 body
 using
 a
 drug
 linked
 to
 a


radioactive
 particle
 and
 this
 is
 opening


up
 a
 whole
 new
 area
 of
 medicine.
 So


these
 are
 just
 some
 of
 the
 examples
 that


we
 see.
 Well,
 so
 these
 are
 some
 of
 the


examples
 but
 I
 mean
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do


you
 personally
 stay
 on
 top
 of
 this?
 I'm


quite
 passionate
 about
 it.
 I
 mean,
 as
 I


said,
 I'm
 a
 physician
 scientist,
 and
 you


know,
 my
 favorite
 meeting
 of
 of
 the


month
 always
 is
 our
 innovation


management
 board,
 which
 I've
 I've


chaired
 now
 for
 13
 years
 since
 I
 was
 the


head
 of
 development
 all
 through
 my
 time


as
 CEO.
 Uh,
 I
 read
 every
 one
 of
 those


documents
 because,
 you
 know,
 that
 that's


in
 the
 end,
 I
 think,
 what
 a
 company
 like


us
 has
 to
 deliver.
 I
 mean,
 for
 us
 to


stay.
 Tell
 me
 tell
 me
 tell
 me
 about
 that


meeting.
 So
 it's
 once
 is
 this
 is
 this


like
 the
 is
 this
 like
 the
 the
 lifeblood


meeting
 of
 the
 company?
 I
 do
 feel
 like


it's
 the
 lifeblood
 meeting
 of
 the


company.
 We
 review
 the
 projects
 that
 our


research
 teams
 are
 bringing
 into
 later


stages
 of
 research
 which
 are
 so
 how
 many


I'm
 sorry.
 So
 how
 many
 how
 many
 people


so
 so
 who
 who
 are
 in
 the
 meeting?
 How


many
 people
 are
 you?
 H
 well
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 people
 who
 end
 up
 attending
 but


the
 core
 members
 is
 about
 seven
 seven


leaders
 head
 of
 research
 development


strategy
 and
 growth
 are
 commercial


leaders
 and
 myself
 and
 the
 CFOs
 maybe


eight
 people
 how
 long
 does
 it
 last


sometimes
 it's
 two
 four
 hour
 meetings


sometimes
 it's
 one
 six
 hour
 meeting
 uh


but
 it
 is
 it
 is
 a
 long
 meeting
 it's
 not


for
 the
 the
 do
 you
 run
 it
 I
 do
 I
 I
 chair


it
 and
 I
 I've
 chaired
 it
 now
 for
 uh
 a


number
 of
 years
 from
 development
 times


to
 to
 today
 but
 Of
 course,
 chairing
 a


meeting
 like
 this
 is
 really
 just
 getting


the
 best
 perspectives
 from
 all
 of
 the


leaders
 in
 the
 room.
 I
 mean,
 what
 can
 I


possibly
 know
 compared
 to
 all
 of
 these


experts,
 but
 we
 always
 have
 the
 teams


come
 in,
 our
 experts,
 uh,
 in
 whether


it's
 cancer
 or
 heart
 disease
 or
 research


experts
 or
 development
 experts,


scientists,
 physicians.
 Uh,
 and
 I
 think


one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 things
 we've


gotten
 much
 better
 at
 is
 having
 a


debate.
 And
 I
 think
 debate
 is
 the
 only


way
 you
 can
 navigate
 these
 complex


topics
 and
 finding
 these
 these
 miracles


that
 we
 talk
 about.
 If
 you're
 not


willing
 to
 have
 the
 counterveiling


position
 in
 the
 room,
 if
 it's
 just


rubber
 stamping,
 then
 of
 course
 you're


liable
 to
 easily
 fall
 into
 all
 of
 the


biases
 that
 come
 in
 to
 taking
 decisions


in
 in
 medicine
 and
 R&D.
 So
 V,
 I'm
 now


your
 uh
 I'm
 now
 top
 uh
 cancer


researcher.
 Okay.
 I
 come
 into
 this


meeting
 uh
 you
 know
 on
 you
 know
 uh
 I've


given
 you
 200
 pages
 to
 read
 beforehand


and
 and
 here
 I
 come
 Nikolai
 Tangan
 the


great
 cancer
 guy.
 So
 what
 happens
 I
 I


come
 in
 there
 I
 do
 I
 present
 or
 you
 just


go
 straight
 to
 questions
 or
 what
 what


happens?
 We've
 evolved
 this
 over
 the


years.
 We
 used
 to
 have
 long


presentations.
 Now
 we
 assume
 the


pre-eread
 is
 read
 and
 we
 ask
 the
 person


the
 the
 leader
 to
 give
 us
 you
 know
 just


a
 three
 minute
 summary
 um
 of
 the
 case


and
 then
 um
 we
 usually
 try
 to
 also
 put


up
 a
 slide
 that
 has
 from
 the
 team's
 view


what
 were
 the
 reasons
 to
 do
 the
 project


or
 what
 were
 the
 reasons
 not
 to
 do
 the


project.
 Uh
 we
 also
 have
 a
 portfolio


analytics
 group
 that
 gives
 us
 lots
 of


data
 and
 analyses
 on
 these
 projects
 and


then
 we
 have
 a
 discussion
 and
 my
 role
 is


to
 get
 that
 the
 room
 to
 really
 discuss


the
 topic
 and
 have
 a
 debate
 and
 see
 uh


are
 we
 doing
 the
 right
 thing
 by
 funding


this
 project
 to
 the
 next
 tollgate
 and
 if


you
 were
 to
 terminate
 uh
 a
 project
 does


that
 happen
 in
 these
 meetings?
 Yes,
 that


and
 that
 is
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 things
 a
 well-run
 R&D


organization
 has
 to
 do.
 You
 have
 to
 be


intellectually
 honest
 as
 to
 where


projects
 are.
 Do
 they
 fit
 in
 your


strategy?
 Do
 they
 have
 the
 data
 to


support
 going?
 Uh
 and
 you
 have
 to
 have


the
 courage
 to
 kindly
 but
 firmly
 explain


to
 teams
 that
 we
 have
 to
 stop
 here
 and


we've
 got
 to
 use
 the
 resources
 for
 other


things.
 That's
 obviously
 never
 uh
 easy,


but
 we
 always
 try
 to
 celebrate
 the
 teams


and
 tell
 them
 it's
 not
 the
 teams
 that


failed.
 If
 they
 did
 their
 work
 right,


the
 science
 simply
 didn't
 deliver
 the


way
 we
 expected.
 And
 that's
 okay.
 That's


just
 part
 of
 the
 work
 that
 we
 do.
 most


of
 our
 projects
 ultimately
 fail.
 Well,
 I


have
 to
 say
 I
 would
 have
 loved
 to
 sit
 in


in
 that
 meeting.
 That
 sounds
 even
 more


interesting
 than
 our
 investment
 meetings


at
 uh
 in
 the
 fund,
 you
 know.
 Yeah,
 our


six
 can
 get
 a
 little
 tough.
 So,
 that's


uh
 that
 that's
 where
 I
 think
 I've
 built


up
 some
 meeting
 endurance
 over
 the
 over


the
 years.
 Um
 moving
 on,
 um
 AI
 and


digital,
 you've
 been
 you
 really
 have


been
 a
 champion
 in
 the
 digital


transformation
 in
 pharma.
 Now
 what
 um


you
 mentioned
 briefly
 in
 the
 beginning


some
 of
 the
 digital
 initiatives
 but
 what


would
 you
 say
 are
 the
 most
 important


ones
 that
 you
 have?
 I
 I
 think
 clearly


AI's
 impact
 in
 research
 and
 development


in
 our
 industry
 will
 likely
 have
 the


longest
 lasting
 ex
 impact.
 There's
 a
 lot


that's
 happening
 in
 operations


manufacturing
 supply
 chain
 finance
 uh


and
 that
 I
 think
 is
 is
 important
 clearly


having
 an
 impact
 already
 but
 ultimately


will
 become
 I
 think
 standard
 across
 our


sector
 and
 other
 sectors.
 The
 biggest


question
 here
 is
 can
 you
 use
 AI
 um
 to


either
 discover
 what
 is
 a
 drug
 target?


So
 think
 of
 it
 as
 the
 key
 lock
 that
 we


need
 to
 unlock.
 So
 find
 those
 key
 locks


and
 then
 can
 you
 also
 use
 AI
 to
 optimize


the
 key
 into
 the
 lock
 so
 that
 that
 key


can
 ultimately
 unlock
 the
 biological


process
 that
 we're
 talking
 about.
 Uh
 now


as
 to
 where
 we
 are
 today,
 we're
 already


using
 AI
 with
 Isomorphic
 Labs,
 the


Google
 Deep
 Mind
 Company,
 other
 partners


to
 optimize
 those
 keys.
 So
 we
 have
 some


ideas
 for
 the
 keys.
 AI
 get
 takes
 all
 of


the
 information
 known
 uh
 out
 there
 and


inside
 the
 company
 and
 optimize
 those


candidate
 drugs
 and
 then
 helps
 us
 speed


up
 the
 process
 by
 predicting
 how
 it
 will


ultimately
 do
 in
 pre-clinical
 safety


toxicology


uh
 in
 terms
 of
 its
 uh
 pharmacocinetics


its
 manufacturability
 that
 process
 is


now
 and
 that's
 really
 happening
 now
 at


scale
 and
 companies
 like
 ours
 and
 at


other
 companies
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 that
 will


hopefully
 shorten
 the
 drug
 development


early
 drug
 development
 process
 by
 years


and
 that's
 I
 think
 really
 exciting
 and


then
 the
 bigger
 question
 is
 could
 you


actually
 unlock
 biological
 processes


with
 AI
 and
 actually
 understand
 and
 that


I'm
 think
 we're
 further
 away
 from
 so
 I


you
 work
 with
 Microsoft
 Palanteer
 but


you
 mentioned
 the
 um
 isomorphic
 labs


which
 is
 Habis's
 uh
 venture
 right
 you


got
 the
 uh
 Nobel
 Prize


um
 inside
 uh
 inside
 Google
 just
 how
 do


you
 work
 with
 them
 what
 do
 they
 do
 for


you
 yeah
 so
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 very
 I
 think


we're
 one
 of
 their
 two
 partners
 and


basically
 ally
 what
 we
 do
 is
 we
 give


them
 again
 to
 take
 the
 the
 key
 the
 key


lock
 and
 the
 key
 analogy
 we
 give
 them


some
 locks
 that
 we
 know
 or
 we


hypothesize
 are
 very
 important
 in


diseases
 like
 cancer
 or
 heart
 disease


that
 we
 simply
 have
 not
 been
 able
 to


drug
 or
 i.e
 find
 the
 key
 for
 and
 we
 say


we've
 struggled
 with
 our
 traditional


methods
 can
 AI
 can
 their
 capabilities
 uh


ultimately
 enable
 us
 to
 to
 find
 those


keys
 and
 so
 what
 they
 do
 is
 they
 use
 AI


to
 design
 new
 drugs
 and
 what's
 been
 very


interesting
 is
 they
 come
 AI
 comes
 up


with
 drug
 structures
 that
 you
 know
 we've


not
 thought
 about
 or
 really
 explored
 um


and
 so
 we're
 starting
 to
 see
 the
 early


results
 I
 think
 we
 now
 have
 over
 six


different
 projects
 going
 with
 them
 and


hopefully
 to
 expand
 more
 into
 the
 future


and
 we'll
 If
 AI
 can
 solve
 what
 we
 call


our
 undruggable
 targets.
 So,
 can
 the
 AI


help
 us
 drug
 the
 undruggable?
 That's
 the


question.
 It's
 interesting
 how


relationships
 with
 uh
 technology


companies
 has
 been
 key
 to
 success
 in


pharma,
 right?
 Because
 that
 wasn't
 the


case
 in
 the
 old
 days.
 H
 how
 how
 do
 you


see
 this
 changing
 going
 forward?
 Just


it's
 a
 big
 shift.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 you


know,
 we've
 learned
 over
 the
 years.


Palanteer
 has
 been
 an
 amazing
 partner
 of


ours.
 We've
 been
 working
 with
 them
 since


20
 2017.
 They've
 helped
 to
 build
 a
 data


lake
 we
 call
 data
 42
 which
 we
 think
 is


one
 of
 the
 most
 advanced
 in
 the


industry.
 Helps
 us
 mine
 all
 of
 our
 data


just
 using
 a
 simple
 text
 field.


Microsoft
 Research
 Labs
 has
 been
 a
 great


partner.
 I
 think
 what
 it
 is
 is,
 you


know,
 you
 have
 to
 find
 the
 right
 use


cases.
 It's
 easy
 to
 try
 to
 chase
 all


kinds
 of
 things
 and
 we
 fell
 into
 that


trap.
 We
 chased
 far
 too
 many
 AI
 and
 data


science
 projects.
 But
 as
 we've
 learned


over
 the
 years,
 if
 you
 get
 the
 right
 use


cases
 and
 you
 find
 the
 right
 partners,
 I


mean,
 Amazon
 has
 helped
 us
 completely


automate
 our
 patient
 services
 in
 the


United
 States
 as
 another
 example,
 you


need
 those
 partnerships
 because
 we


simply
 don't
 have
 the
 technological


know-how
 in
 house.
 Do
 you
 think
 you're


better
 at
 working
 with
 the
 tech


companies
 than
 your
 competitors?


I
 don't
 know.
 You'd
 have
 to
 ask
 the
 the


the
 tech
 companies.
 I
 mean,
 I
 do
 think,


you
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 great
 things
 about


Novartis
 is
 we're
 willing
 to
 pioneer
 at


the
 cutting
 edge.
 edge.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you


look
 at
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 technology
 areas
 in


our
 industry,
 whether
 it's
 therapeutic


platforms,
 AI,
 data
 science,
 we're


always
 at
 the
 leading
 edge.
 That
 also


means
 we
 often
 have
 to
 fight
 through


many
 of
 the
 early
 challenges
 and
 often


means
 also
 we
 have
 the
 failures


associated
 with
 that,
 but
 that's
 kind
 of


the
 ethos
 of
 our
 company.
 We're
 at
 the


leading
 edge.
 You've
 been
 uh
 very


outspoken
 about
 the
 challenges
 facing


the
 European
 pharma
 industry.
 And
 I
 I
 I


heard
 you
 for
 instance
 in
 divorce
 and
 I


was
 just
 like
 wow
 this
 guy
 is
 actually


he's
 he's
 pretty
 outspoken
 you
 know
 he's


like
 he's
 telling
 us
 what
 he
 really


thinks
 and
 and
 there
 are
 many
 cos
 who


actually
 don't
 do
 that.
 So
 so
 tell
 us


about
 this
 tell
 us
 about
 the
 situation


of
 pharma
 in
 Europe
 in
 kind
 of
 no


uncertain
 terms


and
 and
 that
 I
 I've
 pretty
 consistently


done
 uh
 to
 to
 also
 directly
 to
 the


senior
 leaders.
 You
 know,
 Europe
 has


been
 the
 the
 home
 of
 the
 pharmaceutical


industry.
 I
 mean,
 when
 you
 look
 at
 it


100
 years
 ago,
 the
 earliest


pharmaceutical
 companies
 all
 came
 up


along
 the
 Ryan
 River
 and
 in
 related


parts
 of
 of
 Europe,
 it's
 where
 the


industry
 ultimately
 was
 created.
 And


over
 the
 last
 century,
 it
 still
 has
 been


the
 real
 powerhouse
 of
 the
 world.
 When


you
 look
 at
 where
 drugs
 are
 most
 most


manufactured
 right
 now,
 uh
 it's
 in
 it's


in
 Europe
 where
 a
 lot
 of
 R&D
 activity
 is


happening
 in
 Europe.
 Clinical
 trials
 is


happening
 in
 Europe.
 But
 at
 at
 the
 same


time
 what's
 happened
 is
 European


governments
 have
 just
 commoditized
 the


innovation
 that
 that
 we
 deliver
 and
 more


and
 more
 through
 budget
 uh
 constraints


constraining
 how
 they
 uh
 reward


innovation
 propping
 up
 the
 generics


industry
 with
 artificially
 elevated


prices
 not
 taking
 on
 the
 hospital
 sector


they've
 constrained
 and
 constrained
 to


the
 point
 now
 where
 Europe
 at
 population


slightly
 larger
 than
 the
 United
 States


its
 market
 size
 is
 half
 or
 even
 less


than
 half
 of
 of
 the
 US
 and
 not
 growing


whereas
 the
 US
 and
 now
 China
 I
 mean


China
 is
 the
 second
 largest


pharmaceutical
 market
 in
 the
 world


growing
 almost
 at
 20
 or
 growing


certainly
 double
 digit
 and
 so
 Europe


needs
 to
 do
 something
 because
 clearly


you
 know
 the
 US
 administration
 wants


manufacturing
 to
 move
 we've
 seen
 $250


billion
 of
 announcements
 from
 companies


saying
 they're
 going to
 invest
 more
 US


and
 European
 companies
 saying
 they're


going
 to
 invest
 more
 in
 the
 US
 so
 Europe


has
 to
 act
 they
 have
 to
 figure
 out
 how


to
 reward
 innovation
 by
 not
 capping
 drug


prices,
 penalizing
 companies
 when
 they


have
 new
 technologies
 and
 new
 uh


innovations,
 not
 artificially
 finding


ways
 to
 really
 constrain
 the
 innovation


environment
 or
 it
 it
 will
 over
 time


leave.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 just
 the
 economics


is
 Europe
 acting
 not
 fast
 enough.
 No,
 I


mean
 I
 think
 Europe
 is
 trying
 at
 the


European
 level
 to
 do
 what
 they
 what
 they


can
 uh
 easily,
 but
 I
 think
 the
 real
 hard


conversations
 still
 have
 to
 happen
 and
 I


think
 certainly
 the
 the
 trade
 situation


will
 push
 that
 topic
 even
 even
 harder
 as


will
 the
 Trump
 administration's
 push
 on


international
 reference
 pricing.
 What's


but
 what's
 what's
 preventing
 Europe
 from


moving?
 That's
 a
 good
 question.
 Right.
 I


mean
 I
 think
 it's
 political
 will
 um


ultimately
 and
 and
 a
 fundamentally
 a


belief
 that
 the
 industry
 won't
 move
 or


or
 it
 won't
 lead
 to
 a
 shift
 and
 as
 you


know
 I
 mean
 these
 shifts
 don't
 happen


like
 you
 know
 rapidly
 but
 slowly
 over


time
 in
 10
 years
 from
 now
 you
 start
 to


say
 today
 about
 40%
 of
 new
 drugs
 30
 to


40%
 of
 new
 drugs
 are
 not
 launched
 in


Europe.
 European
 patients
 don't
 get


access
 to
 them.
 They're
 primarily


launched
 in
 the
 US
 to
 some
 extent
 China


and
 Japan.
 That
 number
 will
 slowly


increase.
 Slowly
 but
 surely
 you'll
 see


manufacturing
 leave.
 Novartis
 had
 four


manufacturing
 plants
 in
 the
 UK.
 We
 have


zero
 today.
 Uh
 step
 by
 step
 you'll
 see


and
 then
 suddenly
 I
 think
 it'll
 get
 to
 a


unfortunately
 to
 a
 crisis
 as
 it
 did
 in


Japan
 for
 the
 pharmaceutical
 sector
 and


then
 governments
 will
 act
 because


patients
 will
 demand
 where
 are
 these


medicines.
 Governments
 will
 be
 looking


at
 where
 do
 the
 jobs
 go.
 But


unfortunately
 I
 think
 until
 we
 get
 to


that
 crisis
 point
 it's
 easy
 just
 to
 hope


that
 the
 status
 quo
 will
 be
 good
 enough.


Is
 the
 problem
 uh
 Brussels
 or
 is
 it
 the


individual
 countries?
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 I


think
 that
 the
 challenge
 of
 course


Brussels
 would
 say
 they
 don't
 control


innovation
 ecosystems
 and
 individual


markets.
 Um
 and
 so
 individual
 countries


have
 to
 make
 their
 own
 decisions.
 uh


that
 said
 I
 think
 with
 a
 27
 member
 block


without
 some
 sort
 of
 coordinated
 action


given
 the
 trade
 is
 ultimately
 managed
 at


the
 EU
 level
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 very


difficult
 to
 tackle
 this
 problem
 because


of
 the
 just
 this
 the
 dispar
 the


differences
 in
 uh
 GDP
 per
 capita
 across


the
 European
 Union
 and
 so
 I
 think


Brussels
 needs
 to
 come
 up
 with
 a


framework
 to
 guide
 the
 countries


otherwise
 we
 won't
 get
 out
 of
 the


situation
 what
 would
 what
 would
 it
 take


for
 the
 countries
 to
 think
 more
 about


the
 uh
 common
 destiny
 of
 Europe
 rather


than
 just
 their
 on
 situation
 because


it's
 not
 only
 in
 the
 farmer
 industry
 we


seeing
 this
 right
 we're
 seeing
 it
 in


pretty
 much
 every
 industry
 it's
 true
 and


it's
 not
 and
 of
 course
 I
 think


governments
 would
 say
 they've
 got
 to


figure
 out
 defense
 they've
 got
 to
 figure


out
 energy
 they've
 got
 figure
 out
 the


pharmaceutical
 sector
 I
 mean
 I
 think


it's
 going to
 take
 ultimately
 leadership


and
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 think
 some
 more
 of
 the


European
 leaders
 have
 to
 galvanize


support
 across
 Europe
 uh
 and
 I
 think


that
 of
 course
 that's
 challenging
 but


you
 need
 I
 think
 some
 senior
 leaders
 in


Europe
 to
 say
 they're
 going
 to
 take
 this


on.
 I
 think
 if
 each
 country
 sits
 in


their
 corner
 and
 kind
 of
 hopes
 that
 this


will
 work
 itself
 out,
 I
 think
 the
 the


story
 will
 keep
 unfolding
 the
 way
 it's


unfolding.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 Draghi
 wrote


the
 report,
 but
 uh
 I
 guess
 not
 so
 much


is
 happening.
 Um
 despite
 um
 the
 despite


the
 world
 changing,
 right,
 with
 uh


tariffs
 and
 barriers
 and
 so
 on
 uh


moving,
 are
 you
 are
 you
 surprised
 that


not
 more
 is
 happening
 after
 this
 report?


I
 mean
 I
 think
 there
 was
 at
 least


recognition
 and
 I
 I
 have
 to
 say
 that
 at


at
 least
 the
 tone
 uh
 from
 the
 European


Commission
 is
 much
 more
 about
 economic


competitiveness
 and
 less
 about
 uh
 you


know
 the
 whole
 period
 of
 time
 where
 we


had
 so
 many
 new
 bureaucratic
 elements


being
 added
 whether
 it
 was
 CSRD
 or
 uh


the
 due
 diligence
 or
 water
 and
 all
 of


these
 things
 added
 on
 top
 of
 each
 other.


Um
 that
 said
 I
 think
 action
 has
 been


been
 slow.
 Uh
 I
 think
 uh
 and
 I
 think


while
 the
 talk
 has
 been
 you
 know
 high


ultimately
 companies
 respond
 to
 when


they
 see
 real
 concrete
 action.
 Uh
 the
 EU


did
 put
 out
 new
 pharmaceutical
 proposed


pharmaceutical
 legislation
 which


improves
 somewhat
 from
 their
 already


really
 damaging
 approach
 to
 protecting


pharmaceutical
 data.
 But
 already
 that's


still
 worse
 than
 where
 we
 were
 3
 years


ago.
 So
 we
 actually
 went
 from
 a
 place


where
 we
 got
 much
 worse
 and
 now
 we're


less
 worse
 and
 then
 that's
 supposed
 to


be
 a
 victory.
 Um
 so
 you
 know
 I
 I
 think


there
 has
 to
 be
 more
 of
 a
 sense
 of


urgency.
 So
 Vas,
 I'm
 giving
 you
 this


magic
 wand.
 You
 can
 change
 three
 things


in
 European
 farmer.
 What
 would
 you


change?
 I
 would
 say
 the
 that
 we
 should


have
 uh
 Europeanwide
 uh
 list
 price


system
 that
 then
 countries
 can
 adjust


based
 on
 GDP
 per
 capita
 that
 then
 gives


us
 a
 framework
 for
 list
 prices
 across


Europe.
 Uh
 I
 think
 second
 there
 should


be
 no
 allow
 allowance
 for
 capping
 growth


of
 the
 pharmaceutical
 sector.
 So


basically
 like
 if
 you
 take
 a
 country


like
 Italy,
 our
 entire
 growth
 in
 Italy


is
 paid
 back
 to
 Italy
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.
 Uh
 and
 so
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 to


grow
 a
 business
 if
 you're
 always
 paying


back
 your
 growth
 to
 the
 to
 the
 c
 many


countries
 have
 this.
 So
 we've
 got
 to
 end


this
 end
 this
 practice.
 Um
 and
 then
 and


then
 third
 I
 think
 uh
 Europe
 has
 to
 end


also
 its
 practice
 of
 propping
 up
 the


generics
 industry.
 Uh
 go
 to
 the
 US
 model


where
 we
 have
 high
 innovation
 and
 then


generics
 prices
 that
 are
 the
 lowest
 in


the
 world.
 Uh
 and
 then
 you'll
 find
 the


fiscal
 space
 to
 invest
 in
 innovation.


These
 are
 three
 I
 think
 very
 doable
 uh


changes.
 We
 tal
 wrote
 about
 it
 in
 the


financial
 times
 and
 let's
 see
 how
 does


the
 new
 geopolitical
 situation
 impact


the
 way
 you
 think.
 Well,
 I
 think
 first


what
 I
 tell
 my
 people
 is
 we've
 been


around
 for
 250
 years.
 We
 have
 to
 focus


on
 our
 controllables,
 focus
 on
 our


finding
 the
 next
 wave
 of
 medicines,


launching
 them
 well
 and
 doing
 our
 work.


That's
 where
 the
 energy
 of
 Novartis
 has


to
 go.
 Now,
 I
 think
 on
 how
 we
 adjust
 uh


to
 the
 current
 situation,
 I
 think
 the


most
 important
 thing
 is
 to
 have
 more


flexibility.
 And
 what
 we've
 decided
 to


do
 is
 ensure
 we
 have
 manufacturing


capacity
 in
 the
 US
 for
 the
 US
 so
 that
 we


can
 manufacture
 our
 most
 important


medicines
 for
 the
 US
 in
 the
 US
 for


Europe
 and
 then
 similarly
 have


manufacturing
 in
 China
 so
 that


flexibilizes


our
 our
 supply
 chain.
 We're
 also
 working


to
 flexibilize
 our
 R&D
 clinical
 trial


ability
 so
 we
 can
 obviously
 adapt.
 So
 I


think
 you
 have
 to
 create
 much
 more


adaptable
 systems
 in
 your
 company
 and


much
 more
 ability
 to
 react
 to
 how
 how


the
 policies
 uh
 change.
 When
 it
 comes
 to


China,
 you
 have
 you've
 called
 the


Chinese
 innovation
 ecosystem
 a
 wakeup


call
 for
 the
 industry
 and
 you
 also
 talk


about
 staggering
 pace
 of
 clinical
 trial


recruitment
 in
 China.
 Just
 um
 tell
 us


what
 um
 why
 are
 they
 getting
 it
 right


there?
 Well,
 you
 know,
 China
 the
 story


is
 interesting.
 And
 when
 you
 go
 back
 to


2014,
 uh,
 China
 was
 not
 a
 power
 player


in
 in
 biioharmaceuticals.
 First,
 they


made
 some
 important
 uh
 changes
 in
 their


policy
 and
 regulatory
 framework.
 They


modernized
 their
 drug
 regulator
 and


increased
 the
 quality
 standards
 for
 all


manufacturers
 which
 kind
 of
 eliminated
 a


lot
 of
 the
 local
 players
 who
 were
 below


uh
 appropriate
 standards.
 They
 created
 a


national
 reimbursement
 system
 called
 the


NRDL
 list
 for
 new
 medicines.
 But
 then


they
 also
 decided
 to
 create
 a
 process


called
 valuebased
 pricing
 VBP
 that
 when


drugs
 are
 at
 the
 end
 of
 their
 life
 cycle


they
 become
 extremely
 cheap.
 They
 put


all
 of
 this
 together
 into
 a
 package
 and


then
 step
 by
 step
 they
 began
 to
 speed
 up


their
 regulator
 speed
 up
 their
 clinical


trials.
 Now
 there
 was
 a
 big
 boom
 five


six
 years
 ago
 uh
 and
 then
 ultimately
 uh


it
 didn't
 pan
 out
 and
 of
 course
 there


was
 then
 retrenchment
 and
 then
 as
 often


is
 the
 case
 as
 you
 know
 uh
 now
 the


sectors
 come
 back
 very
 strong
 and
 what


we
 see
 the
 biggest
 shifts
 are
 one
 u


we're
 no
 longer
 seeing
 fast
 follower


alone
 we're
 actually
 seeing
 novel


innovation
 novel
 drug
 targets
 novel


technologies
 two
 the
 pace
 of
 clinical


trial
 uh
 start
 and
 recruitment
 in
 China


is
 now
 the
 fastest
 in
 the
 world
 it's


outpacing
 eur
 Europe
 certainly
 outpacing


um
 the
 US.
 Three,
 the
 drug
 regulator
 has


sped
 up.
 So
 you
 can
 get
 approvals
 now
 in


China
 almost
 at
 the
 same
 speed
 as
 you


get
 um
 in
 the
 US
 and
 I
 think
 there's


capital
 as
 well
 flowing
 into
 the


Shanghai
 biotech
 uh
 se
 uh
 sector
 and


that's
 creating
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of


company
 formation.
 So
 this
 has
 led
 I


think
 now
 to
 the
 for
 the
 first
 time


multiple
 new
 drugs
 in
 recent
 years
 novel


drugs
 originating
 from
 China
 getting


approved
 in
 the
 US
 and
 the
 pace
 of
 that


is
 only
 continuing.
 So
 I
 think
 all
 big


bioarma
 now
 is
 looking
 to
 Shanghai
 um


alongside
 Boston
 and
 San
 Diego
 and
 some


of
 the
 other
 hubs.
 Is
 there
 a
 risk
 that


US
 and
 China
 will
 stop
 accepting
 each


other's
 clinical
 data?
 There's
 a
 risk.
 I


think
 it
 would
 be
 very
 damaging.
 I
 mean


the
 whole
 ecosystem
 at
 the
 moment
 is


built
 around
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 run
 global


clinical
 trials.
 I
 mean
 the
 US
 is


usually
 about
 30%
 of
 most
 clinical
 trial


recruitment.
 Uh
 clearly
 China
 now
 makes


up
 an
 increasing
 proportion.
 If
 you
 were


to
 bulcanize
 the
 world
 of
 clinical


clinical
 trials,
 this
 would
 be
 hugely


damaging
 for
 bio
 biioharmaceutical


innovation.
 I
 mean,
 you
 will
 set
 back


drug
 timelines
 significantly
 simply


because
 you
 just
 can't
 fully
 recruit
 in


the
 US.
 Europe
 is
 also
 slowed
 down.
 So,


we
 need
 Asia
 to
 kind
 of
 complete
 our


trial
 recruitment
 at
 the
 appropriate


pace.
 And
 also,
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it


from
 an
 efficiency
 standpoint,
 we
 can


get
 approvals
 in
 both
 markets
 around
 the


same
 time.
 So,
 that
 of
 course
 increases


our
 return
 profile.
 Otherwise,
 you
 know,


you're
 going to
 have
 big
 discrepancies


in
 timelines
 between
 the
 geography.
 We


we
 touched
 on
 on
 on
 pricing
 here,
 but
 um


Novartis
 is
 ranked
 number
 one
 in
 in
 the


access
 to
 medicines
 index.
 Um
 tell
 us


about
 your
 your
 commitment
 to
 global


health
 generally.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I


started
 as
 a
 as
 a
 global
 health
 uh


physician
 deeply
 passionate
 about,
 you


know,
 that
 personally.
 I've
 worked
 on
 as


you
 mentioned
 malaria,
 TB,
 HIV,
 AIDS.


So,
 that's
 a
 passion
 project
 of
 mine.


Now
 the
 reason
 you
 know
 we're
 really
 I


think
 viewed
 as
 a
 leader
 in
 access
 is
 we


not
 only
 provide
 access
 to
 our
 efforts


in
 tropical
 diseases
 where
 malaria


leprosy
 and
 related
 conditions
 we
 made


it
 a
 priority
 uh
 you
 know
 seven
 eight


years
 ago
 to
 say
 we
 want
 to
 provide


access
 to
 our
 latest
 innovations
 as
 fast


as
 possible
 in
 low-income
 countries
 to


when
 we
 provide
 access
 in
 high-income


countries.
 We
 do
 that
 through
 a
 variety


of
 different
 mechanisms,
 emerging
 market


brands,
 uh
 other
 approaches
 that
 that


hopefully
 get
 these
 medicines
 to
 more


and
 more
 patients
 and
 that
 allows
 us
 to


have
 much
 more
 reach
 perhaps
 than
 many


of
 our
 of
 our
 peers
 and
 I
 take
 great


pride
 in
 that.
 So
 you
 can
 get
 a


Novartist
 uh
 hematology
 medicine
 or


heart
 failure
 medicine
 or
 immunology


medicine
 uh
 anywhere
 in
 the
 world
 and
 we


we
 figure
 out
 access
 programs
 so
 that
 no


patient
 gets
 left
 behind
 in
 many
 of


these
 diseases.
 Moving
 on
 to
 leadership.


Um,
 what's
 the
 most
 fun
 part
 of
 your


job?
 I
 think
 interacting
 with
 people


around
 the
 world.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 about


this
 year,
 I've
 already
 been,
 you
 know,


I've
 been
 in
 Japan,
 I've
 been
 in
 China,


um,
 I've
 been
 all
 across
 Europe,
 in
 the


in
 the
 US,
 and
 interacting
 with
 our


people.
 And
 that's
 an
 evolution.
 I
 mean,


I
 would
 have
 said,
 I
 think
 earlier
 on
 in


my
 time,
 I
 love
 the
 science
 and
 the
 most


fun
 part
 of
 my
 job
 is
 that
 IMB
 meeting


and
 being
 involved
 in
 all
 the
 scientific


decisions.
 But,
 you
 know,
 now
 that
 I'm


in
 year
 eight,
 I
 realize
 so
 much
 of
 this


role
 is
 providing
 energy
 to
 the
 people.


You
 have
 to
 I
 mean,
 you're
 the
 chief


energy
 officer
 and
 you
 have
 to
 give


energy.
 You
 have
 to
 build
 belief.
 Um,


and
 that
 comes
 through
 human
 interaction


in
 the
 end.
 Uh,
 and
 that's
 what
 really


powers
 a
 company
 to
 navigate
 all
 of
 the


challenges
 that
 that
 we
 have.
 Uh,
 so


that
 that's
 definitely
 what
 gives
 me
 the


most
 energy.
 Have
 you
 always
 been
 the


energy
 officer?
 No,
 I
 don't
 think
 so.


I've
 learned
 I've
 learned
 so
 much.
 You


know,
 how
 do
 you
 learn
 how
 do
 you
 learn


to


How
 do
 you
 learn
 to
 be
 an
 energy


officer?
 You
 know,
 I've
 I've
 I've
 had


great
 coaches.
 I've
 had
 to
 I
 think
 um


really
 reflect
 on
 what
 does
 the
 role


mean?
 I
 mean,
 so
 much
 of
 giving
 energy


is
 having
 energy.
 So,
 I
 you
 know,
 whole


approach
 around
 mindset,
 movement,


nutrition,
 recovery
 for
 myself
 to
 make


sure
 I
 can
 show
 up
 every
 day
 um
 with


energy.
 But
 I
 also
 think
 the
 unlock
 is


when
 you
 realize
 that
 leadership
 is


really
 about
 the
 possibilities
 you


create
 for
 your
 teams
 and
 the
 people


around
 you.
 Leadership
 is
 not
 about
 the


org
 chart.
 It's
 not
 about
 the


hierarchies.
 It's
 about
 the


possibilities
 that
 you
 create.
 And
 if


you
 make
 that
 mental
 jump,
 then
 you


realize
 it's
 all
 about
 the
 energy
 you


give,
 possibilities
 you
 can
 create.
 Um,


and
 then
 it
 becomes
 of
 course
 a,
 you


know,
 self
 self-fulfilling
 cycle.
 You


feel
 the
 energy,
 you
 give
 the
 energy.


Um,
 and
 I
 think
 that
 was
 a
 certainly
 a


big
 jump
 for
 me
 over
 my
 leadership


journey.
 Did
 you
 have
 a
 particular


moment
 where
 it
 became
 clearer
 to
 you?


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 I
 don't
 know if


there
 was
 a
 particular
 moment,
 but
 there


were
 definitely
 moments
 where
 I
 think
 my


old
 leadership
 model
 was
 not
 working.
 I


mean,
 I
 started
 out
 as
 a
 very
 technical,


very
 intelligent
 kind
 of
 know-it-all


leader.
 There
 was
 a
 point
 you
 hit
 a


wall,
 especially
 when
 you're
 in
 front
 of


sales
 forces
 and
 you
 have
 to
 inspire
 and


motivate
 a
 team
 that
 has
 to
 walk
 into
 a


doctor's
 office
 and
 get,
 you
 know,


basically
 told
 no
 10
 times
 uh
 and
 then


hopefully
 get
 the
 one
 yes.
 Different


leadership,
 different
 approach.
 and
 I


led
 R&D
 organizations
 where
 you
 have
 to


get
 people
 to
 motivate
 through
 failure.


Only
 one
 out
 of
 six,
 seven,
 eight


projects
 succeed
 and
 uh
 you
 got
 to


motivate
 people
 through
 that.
 So
 I
 think


with
 each
 one
 of
 these
 experiences


I've
 adapted
 and
 tried
 to
 learn
 how
 to


lead
 lead
 better.
 I
 think
 of
 myself
 as
 a


always
 as
 being
 a
 student
 of
 leadership.


I
 mean
 how
 do
 you
 keep
 working
 on
 it


getting
 better?
 There's
 no
 destination


on
 that
 leadership
 journey,
 but
 you
 have


to
 keep
 asking
 yourself
 how
 can
 you


adjust
 and
 get
 better
 at
 at
 this.
 But
 I


mean,
 did
 you
 transform
 from
 like
 a


nerdy
 introvert
 to
 to
 the
 extrovert
 you


are
 today
 or
 I
 think
 I'm
 still
 probably


a
 nerdy
 introvert
 at
 heart.
 I
 would


probably
 Well,
 you
 hiding
 it
 well,
 read


books.


Yeah,
 exactly.
 I
 think
 I've
 learned
 to


be
 more
 more
 adaptable
 uh
 and
 and
 sort


of
 uh
 you
 know,
 see
 see
 how
 best
 to


bring
 I
 think
 the
 best
 out
 of
 every


situation.
 Um
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 there
 was


a
 moment,
 but
 certainly
 the
 CEO
 job


pushes
 you,
 right?
 it
 pushes
 you
 in


directions
 because
 you're
 immediately,


you
 know,
 thrust
 in
 front
 of
 so
 many


different
 stakeholders
 u
 and
 learning


the
 language
 of
 those
 different


stakeholders,
 learning
 how
 to
 navigate


all
 those
 different
 stakeholders.
 Um
 you


have
 to
 fail
 at
 it
 as
 you
 go
 and


hopefully
 you
 learn
 and
 get
 better
 and


better
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 how
 the


process
 obviously
 unfolds.
 You
 mentioned


um
 the
 importance
 of
 uh
 being
 energized


yourself.
 Where
 do
 you
 get
 your
 energy


from?
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 our
 a
 few


things.
 I
 think
 our
 people
 gives
 me
 a


tremendous
 uh
 energy.
 So
 interacting


interacting
 with
 them,
 you
 know,
 I
 I


believe
 so
 deeply
 in
 the
 work
 that
 we


do.
 I
 I
 always
 still
 I
 still
 when
 I
 see


a
 clinical
 trial
 result,
 which
 I'm
 very


fortunate
 to
 be
 with
 the
 one
 of
 the


first
 ones
 to
 see
 and
 it
 ultimately
 a


medicine
 that
 worked
 in
 a
 phase
 three


clinical
 trials,
 I
 cry
 because
 it
 is
 so


hard
 to
 do
 what
 we
 do.
 This
 is
 the


collective
 work
 of
 thousands
 of
 people


around
 the
 globe
 likely
 for
 over
 a


decade
 and
 then
 we
 get
 a
 result
 where
 we


actually
 move
 the
 needle
 for
 patients


with
 a
 disease
 and
 then
 it
 you
 know
 you


say
 let's
 keep
 going
 right
 in
 the
 face


of
 whatever
 setbacks
 that
 you
 have
 that


gives
 you
 energy.
 Uh
 letters
 from


patients
 I'm
 very
 fortunate
 to
 get


letters
 from
 patients
 who
 are
 are


medicines
 uh
 whose
 lives
 they've


transformed.
 I
 mean
 all
 of
 these
 things


give
 you
 that
 little
 jolt,
 that
 little


push
 to
 fight
 through
 some
 of
 the
 more


trying
 moments
 of
 being
 a
 CEO.
 But
 you


mentioned
 also
 your
 own
 you
 you


mentioned
 also
 your
 own
 physical
 health


and
 so
 on
 just
 uh
 and
 nutrition
 and
 what


are
 the
 kind
 of
 things
 you
 are


particularly
 Oh
 yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 look
 I
 I


I
 got
 taught
 very
 early
 on
 from
 my
 uh
 a


coach
 that
 I
 work
 with
 today
 named
 Scott


Pelton
 this
 this
 this
 approach
 mindset,


movement,
 nutrition
 and
 recovery
 and
 I


stick
 with
 it.
 Um
 so
 mindset
 you
 know


clearly
 mindfulness
 meditation
 observing


yourself
 observing
 why
 you
 think
 the


things
 you
 think
 why
 you
 feel
 the
 things


you
 do
 uh
 and
 then
 setting
 yourself
 up


in
 the
 right
 mindset
 each
 day
 and
 for


each
 interaction
 or
 each
 moment
 uh
 even


when
 I
 have
 to
 show
 up
 on
 the
 in
 good


company
 podcast.
 Um
 you
 know
 nutrition


you
 know
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 think
 why


do
 you
 eat
 the
 things
 you
 eat
 and
 how


you
 eat
 will
 affect
 your
 performance


even
 in
 small
 ways.
 So
 something
 I


always
 think
 about
 obviously
 movement
 I


mean
 exercise
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 impact
 on
 the


nervous
 system.
 Over
 the
 years
 I've


learned
 that
 exercise
 can
 reset
 your


sympathetic
 and
 parasympathetic
 nervous


system.
 By
 the
 way
 so
 much
 of
 leadership


comes
 down
 to
 managing
 your
 nervous


system.
 You're
 likely
 not
 going
 to
 make


a
 good
 decision
 when
 you're
 on
 high


sympathetic
 drive.
 When
 you're
 more


balanced
 parasitic
 sympathetic,
 you're


more
 likely
 to
 get
 all
 the
 inputs
 that


you
 need.
 So
 observing
 that
 in
 yourself


uh
 is
 is
 hugely
 important.
 And
 then


recovery.
 I've
 learned
 over
 the
 years


the
 power
 of
 sleep.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 obsessed


with
 trying
 to
 optimize
 my
 sleep.
 I've


got,
 you
 know,
 technology,
 sleep


technology,
 sleep
 supplements,
 all
 kinds


of
 things
 to
 really
 say,
 how
 can
 I
 get


seven
 plus
 hours
 of
 very
 high
 quality


sleep
 and
 and
 recover
 and
 all
 of
 those


things
 compound
 over
 time
 and
 then
 give


you
 the
 energy
 you
 need.
 Well,
 you're


very
 thoughtful
 about
 these
 things.
 When


do
 you
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning?


I
 wake
 up
 5:30
 every
 day.
 What's
 the


magic
 ingredient
 uh
 that
 you
 eat?
 What


is
 your
 most


kind
 of
 strange
 thing
 that
 you
 eat?


Strange
 thing
 that
 I
 eat?
 Um,


if
 there's
 anything
 strange,
 I'm
 a


lifelong
 vegetarian,
 so
 I've
 never
 had


meat
 in
 my
 life.
 So,
 you
 know,
 that
 may


be
 strange,
 maybe
 not
 so
 strange.


Obviously,
 there's
 many.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 I


mean,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 Well,
 I
 mean,


India
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 vegetar,
 you
 know,
 I


mean,
 it's
 very
 common,
 right?
 And
 your


parent.
 Yeah,
 it
 is.
 It
 is.
 It
 is.
 Yeah.


Absolutely.
 You
 know,
 nothing
 nothing


really
 strange.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 I
 eat
 whey


protein
 every
 morning.
 Two
 scoops
 of


whey
 protein
 every
 day.
 It's
 kind
 of
 a
 a


way
 I
 start
 my
 day.
 Um,
 nothing
 else


magical
 I
 can
 think
 of.
 I
 mean,
 I
 do
 I


do
 I
 do
 try
 some
 of
 the
 uh
 the
 various


supplements
 like
 ashwagandha
 and
 some
 of


this
 stuff
 I
 have.
 It's
 probably
 all
 a


placebo
 effect,
 but
 nonetheless,
 I
 I


definitely
 I
 definitely
 test
 these


things
 out.
 How
 would
 you
 define
 the


corporate
 culture
 at
 Novartis?
 you
 know


we
 we
 we
 call
 it
 inspired
 curious
 and


unboss
 and
 that
 that
 was
 something
 that


we
 put
 together
 in
 2017
 when
 I
 first


started
 and
 we
 stuck
 with
 it
 and
 it's


very
 much
 grounded
 actually
 in
 work
 by


uh
 many
 psychologists
 who
 really


understood
 for
 for
 knowledge
 workers


three
 things
 really
 motivate
 knowledge


workers
 a
 sense
 of
 purpose
 so
 that's


inspired
 a
 sense
 of
 growth
 and
 learning


and
 a
 sense
 of
 they're
 improving
 theself


that's
 curiosity
 and
 a
 sense
 of
 autonomy


so
 can
 you
 create
 kind
 of
 an
 unbossed


environment
 with
 the
 appropriate,
 you


know,
 uh,
 guide
 rails
 and
 objectives.


So,
 that's
 what
 we
 set
 up
 to
 out
 to
 do.


It
 was
 very
 bumpy.
 We
 came
 from
 a
 very


top-
 down,
 you
 know,
 much
 more


hierarchical
 culture.
 Um,
 I
 think
 we've


made
 a
 lot
 of
 progress,
 but
 we
 still


debate
 it.
 And
 I
 always
 tell
 my
 people,


it's
 great
 that
 we
 debate
 it.
 And
 as


long
 as
 we're
 debating
 the
 culture,
 the


culture
 is
 probably
 getting
 better
 and


we're
 probably
 thinking
 about
 how
 we


want
 to
 interact
 with
 one
 another.
 But


those
 are
 the
 three
 key
 elements
 and
 we


stick
 with
 it.
 But
 I
 mean
 unbossed
 that


doesn't
 sound
 very
 Swiss.
 No,
 actually
 I


think
 it's
 Scandinavian.
 So
 actually
 you


guys
 probably
 should
 take
 the
 take
 the


take
 the
 credit
 for
 it.
 The
 idea
 is
 but


the
 idea
 is
 um
 you
 know
 can
 you
 it's


more
 of
 a
 servant
 leader
 empowered


culture.
 So
 can
 you
 actually
 create


ownership
 at
 every
 level
 of
 the


organization
 uh
 where
 the
 leader
 is


creating
 the
 environment
 removing


obstacles
 creating
 clarity
 and
 you
 and


that's
 some
 of the
 things
 I
 learned.
 I


mean
 UNBOS
 initially
 was
 really


misinterpreted.
 It
 was
 kind
 of


interpreted
 as
 anarchy
 or
 and
 people
 can


do
 whatever
 they
 want.
 Actually,
 what
 we


want
 to
 say
 is
 we
 have
 clear
 objectives,


clear
 goals,
 but
 we
 want
 to
 create
 this


high
 support,
 high
 challenge


environment.
 You're
 supported.
 You
 got


to
 make
 your
 own
 calls,
 but
 we


challenge.
 We
 hold
 accountability
 and
 we


expect
 results.
 And
 if
 you
 can
 get
 that


right,
 it
 really
 really
 drives


performance.
 and
 snap
 and
 I
 look
 at
 the


last
 you
 know
 three
 three
 four
 years


we've
 been
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 league


tables
 on
 TSR
 and
 growth
 um
 so
 it's
 paid


off
 but
 it's
 been
 a
 long
 journey
 for


sure
 India
 has
 produced
 some
 of
 the
 most


impressive
 leaders
 we
 have
 in
 the
 world


today
 uh
 has
 your
 your


Indian
 background
 you
 think
 informed


your
 leadership
 style
 in
 any
 way
 I
 do
 I


think
 I
 think
 yes
 I
 mean
 I
 was
 I
 was


raised
 uh
 kind
 of
 very
 phil
 in
 a
 very


philosophical
 environment
 um
 my


grandparents
 and
 my
 parents
 uh
 all
 all


deeply
 Hindu
 but
 also
 always
 trying
 to


uh
 expose
 us
 to
 philosophical
 um


thinking
 and
 so
 even
 to
 this
 day
 I
 would


say
 some
 of
 the
 best
 leadership
 books


are
 books
 like
 the
 Bhagavat
 Gita
 or
 the


Dao
 Ching
 which
 really
 talk
 about


servant
 leadership
 or
 finding
 a
 sense
 of


purpose
 and
 and
 and
 direction.
 So
 I


think
 it
 certainly
 had
 a
 very
 strong


guide.
 I
 think
 also
 when
 you
 observe


immigrant
 parents
 who
 have
 to
 come
 up


and
 and
 fight
 for
 everything
 from
 where


they
 come
 from
 very
 little
 and
 living


that
 experience
 I
 think
 certainly
 you


know
 builds
 resilience
 and
 determination


as
 as
 a
 child
 for
 sure.
 Well
 in
 India


even
 the
 gods
 have
 to
 be
 humble.
 Are
 you


um
 are
 you
 humble?
 Am
 I
 humble?
 That's


like
 a
 trick
 question.
 I
 sometimes
 feel


like
 I
 think
 I
 try
 to
 be
 I
 try
 to
 be


humble.
 I
 try
 to,
 let's
 say,
 keep
 my


feet
 rooted
 in
 the
 ground.
 I
 think
 one


of
 the
 hardest
 things
 as
 as
 a
 CEO
 is


it's
 easy
 to
 get
 lost
 in
 all
 of
 it,


right?
 It's
 easy
 to
 think
 um
 not


separate
 who
 you
 are
 as
 a
 person
 with


the
 role.
 It's
 a
 role,
 right?
 It's
 a


role
 we
 have
 the
 honor
 to
 play
 for
 a


period
 of
 time
 in
 our
 lives,
 but
 it's


not
 not
 who
 you
 are.
 So,
 you
 have
 to


keep
 staying
 grounded.
 I
 think
 family
 is


super
 important.
 I
 have
 an
 incredible


wife,
 great
 kids,
 great
 parents
 that


keep
 me
 grounded.
 Uh
 but
 you
 have
 to


stay
 grounded
 otherwise
 these
 roles
 can


you
 know
 build
 up
 an
 ego
 um
 and
 and
 you


get
 really
 lost.
 There's
 a
 great
 book


about
 this
 actually
 called
 the
 power


paradox
 um
 from
 yeah
 Dr.
 Kelner
 and
 he


talks
 about
 how
 unchecked
 you
 know
 power


will
 you
 will
 lose
 your
 empathy


considerations
 you'll
 lose
 your


understanding
 of
 humility
 um
 and
 you'll


lose
 the
 very
 things
 that
 actually


afforded
 you
 the
 opportunity
 to
 be
 a


leader
 ironically
 yeah
 it's
 a
 I
 agree


it's
 a
 very
 very
 um
 it's
 a
 very
 good


book
 um
 now
 um
 what
 do
 you
 read
 I'm
 I'm


a
 big
 non-fiction
 reader
 um
 you
 know


right
 now
 I'm
 I'm
 working
 my
 way
 through


Nexus
 uh
 from
 Uvil
 Noah
 Harari.
 Um
 you


know
 I
 think
 uh
 very
 interesting
 author


and
 often
 you
 know
 great
 great
 insights


from
 from
 those
 books.
 Um
 so
 you
 know
 I


love
 I
 love
 you
 know
 science
 uh
 and


non-fiction
 books.
 Um,
 some
 I
 mean


probably
 my
 my
 favorite
 uh
 one
 of
 my


favorite
 books
 is
 uh
 Enlightenment
 Now


by
 Steven
 Pinker
 which
 is
 grounded
 in


the
 data
 that
 we
 live
 despite
 all
 of
 the


challenges
 we
 read
 about
 in
 the
 newsfeed


we
 live
 in
 the
 greatest
 moment
 in
 human


history
 and
 if
 we
 can
 remind
 ourselves


of
 that
 and
 keep
 building
 on
 that
 on
 a


science-based
 way
 not
 easy
 in
 today's


world
 um
 yeah
 that's
 that's
 where


progress
 lies
 and
 and
 talking
 of
 which


um


last
 question
 what
 advice
 would
 you
 to


young
 people.
 Yeah,
 I
 I
 think
 I
 wish
 not


one
 piece
 of
 advice
 but
 a
 few
 pieces
 of


advice.
 One,
 build
 range,
 build
 breath


and
 experience
 early
 on.
 I
 mean,
 try
 to


get
 diverse
 experiences.
 It's
 so


tempting
 and
 I
 fell
 into
 the
 trap
 of


wanting
 to
 race
 up
 the
 ladder
 and


actually
 it's
 such
 a
 and
 Novartis


actually
 ended
 ended
 up
 pushing
 me
 into


all
 kinds
 of
 lateral
 directions
 in
 in


R&D
 in
 marketing
 in
 manufacturing
 and


all
 of
 those
 experiences
 actually
 now


enable
 me
 to
 do
 the
 job
 that
 I
 have


right
 now
 though
 I
 didn't
 realize
 it
 at


the
 time.
 So
 I
 think
 building
 range
 and


getting
 different
 experiences,


functions,
 geographies,
 uh
 even
 things


you
 may
 not
 expect.
 You'll
 always
 learn


something
 if
 you
 go
 in
 with
 an
 open,


curious
 mindset.
 Um
 I
 think
 too,
 you


know,
 there's
 not
 it's
 not
 a
 race.
 I


mean,
 it
 feels
 like
 it's
 a
 race.
 It's


not
 a
 race
 in
 the
 end.
 You
 you
 got
 to


enjoy
 the
 whole
 process
 of
 whatever


direction.
 And
 there's
 no
 plan.
 I
 never


expected
 to
 be
 a
 CEO.
 Most
 of
 my
 career


moves
 were
 not
 the
 plan
 that
 I
 actually


had,
 frankly.
 they
 ended
 up
 going
 in
 a


different
 direction.
 Um,
 so
 there's
 no


plan.
 It's
 not
 a
 race.
 You
 got
 to
 you've


got
 It
 sounds
 cliche,
 but
 you've
 got
 to


find
 a
 way
 to
 be
 in
 the
 moment
 of
 the


journey
 while
 still
 obviously
 pushing


pushing
 yourself
 uh
 forward
 and
 then


find
 great
 sponsors.
 You
 got
 I
 mean,
 I


would
 not
 be
 where
 I
 am
 today
 if
 some


people
 did
 not
 take
 huge
 bets
 on
 me.
 And


you
 need
 to
 find
 those
 sponsors.
 Well,


uh,
 Vas,
 I
 can
 easily
 understand
 why


people
 have
 taken
 uh,
 huge
 uh,
 bets
 on


you.
 uh
 you
 you
 clearly
 have
 the
 range,


you
 enjoy
 what
 you
 do
 and
 and
 you
 are
 in


the
 moment
 and
 uh
 a
 very
 very
 impressive


CEO.
 So
 big
 thanks
 for
 for
 being
 with
 us


today
 and
 all
 the
 best
 going
 forward.


Thank
 you
 so
 much,
 Sinclair.
 It's
 an


honor
 to
 be
 here.
 Thank
 you.
