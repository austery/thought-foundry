A
 big
 lesson
 that
 I
 learned
 at
 Apple


while
 I
 was
 there
 was
 the
 obsession
 with


detail.
 There
 was
 like
 a
 great
 sense
 of


ownership
 and
 craftsmanship.
 Everyone


deeply
 cared
 about
 making
 it
 right.


Also,
 when
 it
 came
 to
 design,
 building,


and
 shipping,
 there
 was
 so
 much
 thought


put
 into
 it.
 When
 you
 build
 a
 product,


it's
 not
 just
 to
 solve
 a
 problem.
 It's


almost
 like
 storytelling.
 It's
 a


message.
 Great
 storytelling
 is
 really


about
 that
 wow
 factor.
 If
 you're
 talking


about
 from
 a
 product
 standpoint,
 you


want
 to
 identify
 what
 the
 wow
 factor
 is


and
 show
 that
 to
 your
 users
 as
 quickly


as
 possible.
 And
 that's
 like
 kind
 of


part
 of
 reason
 why
 like
 Steve
 Jobs
 were


very
 obsessed
 about
 the
 computers
 saying


hello.
 Whenever
 you're
 developing
 a


product,
 you're
 kind
 of
 almost
 telling
 a


message
 to
 the
 world
 what
 you're
 about.


So
 yes,
 the
 best
 UI
 is
 an
 abstraction
 of


the
 UI
 that
 doesn't
 need
 to
 prompt
 you


for
 login,
 that
 doesn't
 need
 to
 prompt


you
 for
 approvals.
 It
 should
 just
 happen


automatically.
 Our
 ultimate
 goal
 for


magic
 is
 making
 technology
 feel


invisible.
 One
 thing
 that
 I
 would
 say


has
 expanded
 is
 we're
 now
 not
 just


thinking
 about
 humans,
 we're
 also


thinking
 about
 AI
 agents.
 You're
 able
 to


trust
 that
 AI
 agent
 is
 making
 the
 right


decisions
 and
 right
 actions
 even
 while


you're
 asleep.


>> Hi.
 Hi
 everyone.
 Uh,
 my
 name
 is
 Sean.


I'm
 the
 co-founder
 and
 CEO
 of
 Magic


Labs.
 We
 are
 on
 a
 mission
 to
 make
 crypto


more
 accessible
 to
 everyday
 people.
 We


were
 known
 for
 inventing
 the
 first


embedded
 wallet.
 To
 date,
 we
 have


onboarded
 over
 50
 million
 wallets
 and


200,000
 developers
 across
 various


breakout
 crypto
 applications
 like
 Poly


Market,
 Helium,
 Immutable
 Wallet
 Connect


to
 enterprises
 like
 Naver
 and
 Forbes,


but
 also
 getting
 reinvestment
 from


PayPal
 ventures
 that
 at
 the
 time
 we
 were


able
 to
 raise
 over
 $80
 million
 in


funding
 throughout
 this
 whole
 period.


Magic
 is
 also
 the
 developers
 behind
 the


Newton
 protocol,
 which
 is
 the
 world's


first
 policy
 protocol
 to
 help
 secure
 and


on
 board
 hundreds
 and
 trillions
 of
 new


assets
 on
 chain
 across
 AI,
 institutional


crypto
 and
 beyond.
 Our
 vision
 is
 to


upgrade
 the
 trust
 infrastructure
 in
 the


world
 and
 help
 billions
 of
 users
 move
 on


chain.


[Music]


I
 was
 fortunate
 enough
 to
 have
 a


computer
 very
 early
 on.
 Kind
 of
 over
 the


years
 was
 just
 really
 interested
 in
 the


computer.
 Um
 played
 a
 lot
 of
 games
 and


eventually
 was
 very
 interested
 uh
 in


Starcraft
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I
 was


very
 uh
 very
 interested
 in
 music.
 Uh
 I


thought
 that
 was
 what
 I
 was
 going
 to
 do.


I
 really
 love
 playing
 jazz
 music.
 I


played
 the
 saxophone.
 So
 I
 talked
 to
 my


dad
 and
 as
 a
 Asian
 parent,
 he
 found
 a


very
 clever
 way
 to
 convince
 me.
 He
 was


like,
 "Hey
 Sean,
 if
 you
 do
 software


engineering,
 you
 only
 need
 to
 work
 one


job
 and
 play
 music
 on
 the
 side."
 And
 I'm


like, "Oh,
 that
 sounds
 great.
 I
 like


computer.
 Jazz
 is
 kind
 of
 like
 creating


uh
 uh
 music,
 art.
 Uh
 why
 don't
 I
 learn


building
 and
 creating
 for
 real
 in


school?"
 So
 we
 applied
 to
 uh
 the
 waterl


software
 engineering
 program
 and
 uh


luckily
 I
 got
 in
 that's
 how
 I
 went
 on


the
 journey
 to
 um
 to
 truly
 like
 learn
 to


build
 things
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time


waterlue
 has
 a
 very
 uh
 strong
 startup


culture.
 It
 was
 a
 super
 great


environment
 where
 you
 can
 learn
 from


each
 other
 you
 can
 learn
 from
 your


seniors.
 So
 I
 was
 like
 very
 involved
 in


that
 culture
 with
 the
 previous
 uh


co-founders.
 Uh
 the
 project
 was
 out


kitematic.
 We
 went
 through
 a
 lot


actually
 like
 we
 went
 through
 just
 so


many
 like
 ups
 and
 downs
 uh
 from
 working


on
 kitematic.
 When
 we
 uh
 launched
 the


Dropbox
 for
 your
 code
 kind
 of
 product,


we
 we
 got
 like
 20,000
 developers
 in
 one


month
 and
 it
 was
 growing
 really
 really


fast.
 We
 had
 to
 raise
 money.
 We
 applied


to
 Y
 Combinator
 and
 we
 actually
 got
 a


recommendation
 there.
 But
 after
 we


pitched,
 we
 were
 rejected
 from
 Y


Combinator.
 So
 we
 actually
 had
 to
 like


ramp
 down
 the
 service
 is
 to
 keep
 it


running.
 Pretty
 challenging
 time.
 Um


we're
 just
 like
 kind
 of
 new
 grads
 at


like
 our
 our
 most
 desperate
 moments.
 you


know,
 we
 got
 an
 opportunity
 uh
 from


Lightseed
 Ventures
 to
 come
 to
 the


Silicon
 Valley
 for
 a
 summer
 and
 they


kind
 of
 sponsored
 the
 whole
 summer
 and


so
 we
 came
 and
 they
 got
 all
 these
 great


mentors
 uh
 to
 teach
 us
 like
 how
 to
 build


not
 only
 how
 to
 build
 but
 to
 sell
 as


well.
 Essentially
 from
 that
 process
 we


were
 able
 to
 iterate
 on
 kitematic.
 We


were
 able
 to
 get
 the
 requirement
 from


actual
 uh
 devops
 people
 at
 companies
 who


actually
 just
 wanted
 to
 run
 docker
 for


their
 team
 locally
 on
 the
 computer.
 And


at
 the
 time
 Docker
 is
 not
 very
 smooth


like
 you
 can't
 really
 run
 it
 locally
 on


Mac
 or
 Windows
 that
 easily.
 So
 we
 saw
 an


opportunity.
 We
 brought
 the
 server


software
 down
 to
 a
 local
 desktop


environment
 so
 that
 like
 you
 don't
 have


to
 pay
 the
 server
 cost
 and
 then
 we
 open


sourced
 it
 to
 get
 maximum
 distribution.


And
 so
 we
 launched
 Kitematic.
 It


essentially
 took
 off
 and
 we
 were
 able
 to


get
 interest
 from
 investors
 who
 gave
 us


term
 sheets
 and
 also
 uh
 companies
 like


Docker
 who
 reached
 out
 who
 wanted
 uh
 to


acquire
 us
 as
 well.


I
 would
 say
 the
 most
 important
 part
 of


the
 journey
 was
 where
 you
 end
 up
 is


never
 originally
 expect.
 Progress
 is
 not


a
 very
 uh
 linear
 process.
 It's
 actually


a
 lot
 like
 art.
 You
 know,
 the
 more


you're
 like
 super
 super
 focused
 on
 one


very
 specific
 outcome,
 you're
 kind
 of


blocking
 yourself
 out
 of
 all
 different


kinds
 of
 possibilities.
 But
 you
 also


can't
 like
 get
 swayed
 too
 much.
 you
 want


to
 commit
 to
 to
 some
 kind
 of
 like


mission,
 right?
 Like
 like
 for
 example,


for
 us,
 it
 was
 like
 we
 really
 want
 to


make
 it
 easy
 to
 build
 software.
 Just


something
 like
 that.
 But
 with
 that


mission,
 how
 you
 get
 there
 is
 very


flexible.
 Uh
 it's
 never
 like
 100%
 clear,


right?
 And
 you're
 also
 at
 the
 same
 time


dealing
 with
 a
 rapidly
 evolving


environment
 at
 the
 same
 time
 as
 like


your
 own
 customer
 need
 and
 your
 own


company's
 limitations,
 right?
 They
 say


these
 things
 like
 uh
 like
 artists
 work


with
 constraints,
 right?
 So
 you're
 like


there's
 all
 these
 constraints
 and
 and


changes
 and
 I
 think
 diamonds
 come
 from


the
 friction
 right
 that
 you
 are
 dealing


with
 in
 this
 process
 just
 over
 the


course
 of
 this
 many
 years
 just
 building


0ero
 to
 one
 again
 and
 again.
 It's
 really


getting
 the
 groove
 of
 this.
 So,
 so,
 so


when
 I
 hit
 like
 a
 friction
 point,
 I'm


actually
 like
 excited
 because
 it
 kind
 of


becomes
 an
 opportunity
 for
 you
 to
 find


the
 truth
 that
 others
 wouldn't
 be
 able


to
 see.
 So,
 definitely
 like
 a
 big
 part


of
 the
 lesson
 that
 I've
 learned
 over
 the


years.


We
 were
 able
 to
 work
 very
 very
 closely


with
 uh
 the
 founder
 uh
 of
 Docker


learning
 about
 decentralized
 technology


at
 the
 time.
 uh
 by
 working
 with
 him,
 we


we
 were
 talking
 about
 IPFS


when
 like
 I
 didn't
 even
 know
 about
 like


Ethereum.
 I
 was
 like
 what
 the
 hell
 is


Ethereum
 and
 I
 was
 googling
 under
 under


the
 the
 table.
 Uh
 after
 that
 just


something
 about
 it
 really
 stuck
 with
 me.


I
 went
 to
 uh
 some
 Berkeley
 meetups
 where


I
 met
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 OG
 like
 web
 3
 folks


and
 they
 were
 talking
 about
 all
 these


like
 use
 cases
 that
 like
 blockchain
 can


enable.
 Honestly,
 like
 it
 kind
 of
 felt


like
 a
 renaissance
 where
 people
 are
 in


these
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 coffee
 shops,


bars
 just
 talking
 about
 like
 really
 cool


ideas
 and
 these
 were
 like
 really
 big


ideas,
 right?
 It's
 like
 moving
 finance


on
 chain
 like
 how
 it's
 going
 to
 change


governance,
 how
 it's
 going
 to
 change
 uh


music,
 uh
 art,
 like
 everything
 I
 I


wanted.
 Super
 interesting
 from
 an


infrastructure
 perspective,
 but
 also


from
 a
 use
 case
 perspective.
 It
 kind
 of


showed
 me
 that
 blockchain
 is
 more
 than


just
 cryptocurrencies
 like
 you
 can
 buy


and
 trade
 and
 transact
 but
 also
 these


use
 cases,
 right?
 So
 that's
 when
 I
 saw


the
 vision.
 Yeah.
 I
 got
 like
 goosebumps


everywhere.
 I
 remember
 calling
 my
 mom.


He's
 like,
 "Oh,
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 this.
 I


don't
 know
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 do,
 but
 I


have
 to
 be
 in
 this
 space."


So
 Sean
 and
 I
 go
 way
 back.
 We
 actually


both
 graduated
 in
 the
 same
 program


called
 software
 engineering
 from


Waterlue.
 Sean
 graduated
 2
 years
 ahead


of
 me.
 We
 first
 both
 uh
 went
 off
 in
 our


own
 direction.
 He
 sold
 the
 startup


Kitematic
 to
 Docker
 and
 his
 product
 is


now
 known
 as
 Docker
 Desktop.
 And
 for
 me,


I
 joined
 Uber
 early
 in
 2015
 when
 the


team
 was
 still
 very
 small
 and
 I
 got
 to


ride
 through
 the
 hyper
 growth
 phase.
 So


both
 of
 us
 dabbled
 into
 Ethereum
 around


2016
 and
 or
 uh
 2017.
 And
 for
 me,
 I
 heard


about
 Ethereum
 when
 I
 was
 uh
 just
 about


graduating
 uh
 university
 and
 I
 heard


this
 guy
 named
 Vitalik
 and
 I
 heard
 this


word
 Ethereum
 and
 he's
 creating
 this
 new


blockchain
 called
 Ethereum
 and
 at
 the


time
 I
 only
 knew
 about
 Bitcoin.
 So
 it


really
 got
 me
 interested
 in
 looking
 more


into
 technology
 and
 what
 I
 liked
 about


that
 was
 for
 me
 Bitcoin
 was
 more
 about


just
 a
 value
 transfer
 and
 at
 the
 time
 it


was
 really
 fast.
 Now
 it's
 more


considered
 as
 like
 a
 digital
 gold
 but


with
 Ethereum
 it
 was
 adding
 logic
 into


the
 blockchain.
 So
 imagine
 there's
 no


middleman
 and
 uh
 you
 can
 pretty
 much


peer-to-peer
 not
 just
 transfer
 value
 but


actually
 add
 logic
 to
 it.
 Any
 form
 of


contract
 whether
 that
 agree
 on
 a


contract
 on
 real
 estate
 when
 you
 sell


like
 assets
 tied
 to
 let's
 say
 prediction


market
 that's
 all
 can
 be
 facilitated


through
 Ethereum.
 I
 got
 interested
 into


that.
 And
 then
 for
 Sean
 I
 remember
 he


told
 me
 that
 he
 was
 trying
 out
 a
 couple


projects
 on
 Ethereum
 and
 he
 noticed
 that


it
 was
 really
 hard
 to
 onboard
 new
 users.


And
 for
 me,
 when
 I
 tried
 out
 Ethereum,
 I


saw
 the
 potential
 of
 technology,
 but


also
 I
 noticed
 the
 broken
 user


experience
 as
 well.
 Funnily
 enough,
 we


actually
 got
 to
 know
 that
 we
 both
 had


seen
 the
 same
 painpoint.
 We
 actually


reconnected
 in
 person.
 So
 that
 was
 in


2018.
 Uh
 we
 met
 at
 a
 arcade
 bar
 in
 San


Francisco
 called
 uh
 Coinop
 and
 it
 it


started
 as
 casual
 drinks
 and
 then
 became


more
 like
 a
 5-hour
 deep
 conversation.
 We


kept
 circling
 back
 to
 one
 question.
 Why


hasn't
 anyone
 tackled
 in
 simplifying


onboarding
 in
 blockchain?
 Why
 hasn't


anyone
 tried
 building
 a
 very
 easy
 login


with
 email?
 And
 that's
 the
 moment
 when


it
 clicked.
 That
 was
 a
 solution
 to
 the


fundamental
 problem
 of
 blockchain
 uh


with
 the
 broken
 user
 experience.
 So
 we


built
 the
 conviction
 there
 and
 we


decided
 to
 team
 up
 and
 start
 magical


apps.


At
 Apple,
 I
 worked
 on
 a
 couple
 things.


One
 was
 integrating
 Apple
 Maps
 into


Siri.
 The
 other
 one
 was
 uh
 directly


working
 on
 the
 tokenization
 pipeline.
 A


big
 lesson
 that
 I
 learned
 at
 Apple
 while


I
 was
 there,
 the
 obsession
 with
 detail


and
 especially
 it
 being
 spread
 through


the
 leaders
 like
 Steve
 Jobs,
 Tim
 Cook


and
 Johnny
 I.
 Couple
 things
 that
 I


noticed
 was
 there
 was
 like
 a
 great
 sense


of
 ownership
 and
 craftsmanship.
 Everyone


deeply
 cared
 about
 making
 it
 right.


Also,
 when
 it
 came
 to
 design,
 building


and
 shipping,
 there
 was
 so
 much
 thought


put
 into
 it.
 At
 Apple,
 every
 task
 or


every
 idea
 that
 we
 had,
 we
 approached
 it


with
 perfectionistic
 mindset.
 When
 I


started
 Magic
 with
 Sean
 and
 all
 the


times
 we're
 building
 along
 the
 way,
 one


thing
 that
 I
 realized
 was
 perfection


takes
 time.
 There's
 no
 way
 you
 can
 get


it
 right
 as
 a
 small
 company
 going
 from
 0


to
 one
 to
 come
 out
 with
 a
 product
 that's


perfect.
 I
 don't
 think
 anyone
 in
 the


world
 can
 do
 that.
 When
 it
 came
 to
 zero


to
 one,
 we
 focused
 on
 shipping
 fast,


getting
 the
 product
 out
 so
 that
 we
 can


get
 user
 feedback.
 And
 we
 focused
 on


really
 leaning
 into
 their
 feedback,
 but


also
 trusting
 our
 intuition
 of
 what
 the


next
 stage
 of
 the
 product
 can
 be.
 So


after
 multiple
 and
 multiple
 iterations,


that's
 when
 I
 started
 to
 kind
 of
 slip
 in


certain
 parts
 that
 we
 can
 perfect.
 And


also
 um
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 user
 feedback,
 you


see
 these
 patterns
 where
 it
 helps
 you


build
 confidence
 on
 investing
 in
 certain


features
 to
 make
 it
 very
 perfect.
 So
 my


overall
 lesson
 is
 it's
 something
 that


should
 always
 stay
 with
 you,
 but
 it's


very
 important
 to
 find
 the
 right
 time


and
 find
 the
 right
 opportunity
 to


practice
 that
 profession.


Before
 magic
 came
 into
 the
 scene,
 the


only
 people
 that
 could
 use
 blockchain


was
 crypto
 enthusiasts
 or
 technologists.


At
 the
 time,
 I
 would
 say
 using
 a


blockchain
 kind
 of
 felt
 like
 trying
 to


assemble
 IKEA
 furniture
 without
 any


instructions
 given
 to
 you.
 You
 had
 all


these
 unfamiliar
 parts
 and
 at
 every
 step


along
 the
 way,
 you
 have
 to
 figure
 out
 on


the
 fly.
 It
 was
 so
 confusing
 that
 most


people
 had
 given
 up
 even
 before


finishing
 a
 setup.
 And
 for
 example,
 like


uh
 in
 crypto,
 you
 have
 to
 first
 download


a
 browser
 extension
 and
 then
 you
 have
 to


write
 down
 the
 seed
 phrase
 and
 also


figure
 out
 how
 to
 store
 that
 safely.


Also,
 you
 had
 to
 read
 and
 sign
 these


unreadable
 blockchain
 messages
 without


really
 knowing
 what
 you're
 agreeing
 to.


On
 top
 of
 that,
 there
 are
 gas
 fees
 and


there
 are
 more
 and
 more
 blockchain


jargon.
 Uh
 it
 was
 definitely


overwhelming.
 And
 where
 magic
 came
 in,


we
 came
 up
 with
 a
 very
 simplified


onboarding
 solution.
 login
 with
 email,


phone
 number
 and
 and
 social
 login.
 What


we
 did
 was
 we
 took
 blockchain
 that
 was


powerful
 but
 yet
 it
 was
 inaccessible
 and


we
 made
 it
 feel
 familiar,
 seamless
 and


secure.
 So
 the
 biggest
 reason
 to
 why


people
 didn't
 do
 that
 at
 the
 time


because
 the
 de
 facto
 standard
 was
 using


browser
 extensions
 and
 there
 were
 a
 lot


of
 dogmatic
 sort
 of
 sentiment
 web
 3


space
 where
 as
 an
 end
 user
 you
 have
 to


manage
 your
 private
 key
 100%.
 By
 like


writing
 it
 down
 and
 like
 burying
 it
 like


a
 pirate
 treasure
 right
 that
 was
 kind
 of


where
 the
 space
 was
 at
 just
 from
 like
 a


sentiment
 perspective.
 uh
 we
 saw
 the


opportunity
 is
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


frustration
 from
 users
 from
 developers


from
 having
 to
 deal
 with
 this
 dogma
 but


the
 vocal
 minority
 was
 like
 really


pushing
 the
 full
 decentralization


narrative.
 What
 we
 were
 working
 on
 was


extremely
 controversial
 at
 the
 time
 and


we
 actually
 got
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 uh


heat
 on
 Twitter
 at
 the
 time
 for
 even


doing
 this
 or
 even
 like
 thinking
 about


doing
 this.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 naturally


deterred
 people
 from
 working
 on
 this.


Also
 at
 the
 time
 because
 people
 were


deterred
 from
 doing
 this,
 they
 assumed


that
 there's
 no
 other
 way
 to
 build
 a


non-custodial
 uh
 key
 management
 solution


because
 they
 haven't
 like
 really
 looked


into
 the
 solution
 in
 the
 first
 place.


They
 say,
 "Oh,
 it's
 very
 difficult.


People
 are
 not
 going
 to
 want
 this


anyway.
 People
 want
 decentralization."


Whereas
 for
 me
 it's
 like
 hey
 can
 we
 do


more
 on
 the
 technical
 part
 so
 we
 can


actually
 get
 the
 best
 of
 both
 worlds.
 We


can
 both
 offer
 web
 two
 style
 login
 but


also
 web3
 style
 like
 non-custodialness


went
 down
 the
 rabbit
 hole
 to
 solve
 this


specific
 problem
 because
 we
 also
 noticed


in
 our
 like
 sales
 calls
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 DAP


developers
 were
 asking
 hey
 how
 is
 it


non-custodial
 if
 it's
 too
 centralized


it's
 too
 risky
 we
 don't
 want
 that
 so
 we


actually
 had
 to
 solve
 this
 problem
 and


this
 showed
 up
 in
 like
 investor


conversations
 as
 well
 all
 of
 that


pressure
 actually
 forced
 us
 to
 solve
 the


problem
 because
 we
 were
 already
 on
 the


path
 to
 solve
 this.
 We
 were
 able
 to
 kind


of
 invent
 the
 first
 non-custodial
 key


management
 patent
 called
 delegated
 key


management
 and
 we
 ended
 up
 like
 filing
 a


patent
 for
 it.
 So
 actually
 that


technology
 was
 a
 key
 factor
 to
 how
 we


were
 able
 to
 complete
 our
 seed
 round.
 Um


because
 at
 the
 time
 there
 was
 like
 these


huge
 like
 crypto
 exchange
 hacks
 really


scared
 the
 investors
 around
 investing
 in


any
 kind
 of
 centralized
 key
 management


solution.
 But
 we
 were
 able
 to
 kind
 of


bring
 this
 new
 innovative
 tech
 which


made
 a
 huge
 difference
 and
 that's
 how
 we


were
 able
 to
 grow
 very
 quickly
 early
 on


because
 it
 strikes
 the
 best
 balance
 in


both
 worlds
 instead
 of
 like
 kind
 of


leveraging
 fully
 smart
 contract
 wallets


at
 the
 time
 which
 didn't
 scale
 super


well
 or
 like
 super
 centralized
 solutions


which
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 friction
 in
 terms
 of


adoption.
 So
 that's
 how
 we
 were
 able
 to


um
 really
 get
 to
 where
 we
 were.


The
 Bitcoin
 blood
 bath
 continues
 as
 the


cryptocurrency
 is
 stuck
 below
 6,000.
 Can


crypto
 traders
 expect
 more
 new
 lows
 over


the
 weekend.


>> Bitcoin
 falling
 below
 $6,000
 overnight


amid
 a
 broader
 cryptocurrency
 bloodbath.


Now
 slightly
 off
 those
 lows,
 we're


seeing
 Bitcoin
 futures
 trading
 near


their
 lowest
 levels
 of
 the
 year.


However,
 so


>> yeah,
 in
 2018,
 the
 crypto
 market
 had


completely
 taken
 a
 downturn.
 I
 remember


uh
 crypto
 was
 being
 called
 a
 scam
 from


media
 headlines.
 ACS
 had
 pulled
 back
 and


the
 ICO
 bubble
 had
 burst.
 Definitely
 the


people
 that
 are
 left
 over
 in
 the
 space


were
 the
 true
 believers
 of
 crypto
 and


the
 true
 uh
 builders
 of
 crypto
 and
 we're


definitely
 one
 of
 them.
 For
 us
 uh
 even


though
 the
 market
 had
 completely
 taken
 a


downturn,
 we
 saw
 an
 opportunity
 to
 solve


a
 real
 fundamental
 problem
 and
 that
 was


the
 broken
 user
 experience.
 Sean
 and


myself,
 we
 weren't
 discouraged
 at
 all.


That's
 something
 that
 we
 truly
 believed


in
 that
 needed
 to
 be
 solved.
 And
 at
 the


same
 time
 uh
 for
 me
 at
 Apple
 I
 learned


that
 user
 experience
 is
 actually


everything
 and
 someone
 in
 the
 space
 had


to
 jump
 in
 and
 really
 start
 from


backwards
 as
 in
 start
 from
 the
 user


experience
 and
 back
 towards
 a
 uh


blockchain
 technology.
 And
 we
 felt
 like


we're
 the
 right
 people
 to
 be
 able
 to


tackle
 that.
 Uh
 we
 jumped
 on
 it,
 founded


Magic
 Labs,
 pursued
 our
 vision
 of
 making


blockchain
 accessible.


>> There
 are
 multiple
 times
 that
 I
 doubted


and
 Sean
 doubted
 as
 well
 if
 we
 were


taking
 the
 right
 path.
 There
 was
 one


time
 when
 we
 had
 only
 one
 month
 of


runway.
 We
 did
 doubt
 if
 we
 were
 taking


the
 right
 path
 because
 if
 we
 were
 then


we
 probably
 wouldn't
 have
 ended
 up
 with


only
 one
 month
 of
 runway.
 uh
 we're


pretty
 much
 close
 to
 running
 out
 of


money
 and
 closing
 down
 our
 startup.
 So


that's
 the
 time
 I
 doubted.
 At
 the
 time


there
 are
 actually
 not
 many
 people
 left


in
 the
 space.
 So
 no
 one
 told
 us
 to
 quit.


As
 I
 said,
 people
 had
 written
 crypto


off.
 A
 lot
 of
 pulled
 out.
 There
 are
 not


many
 builders
 left
 in
 the
 space.
 It
 was


more
 about
 just
 growing
 with
 the


community
 of
 builders
 that
 were
 left


over
 and
 we're
 all
 true
 believers
 of


crypto.
 For
 myself
 and
 Shawn,
 we
 just


felt
 this
 great
 responsibility
 of


needing
 to
 deliver
 the
 solutions
 so
 that


at
 least
 even
 if
 it's
 an
 experiment,
 it


can
 be
 tried
 out
 on
 the
 blockchain
 and


show
 to
 other
 developers,
 but
 also
 show


the
 world
 that
 there
 is
 this
 seamless


onboarding
 solution
 that
 can
 be
 tried


out.
 And
 luckily,
 it
 worked
 out.
 But


even
 if
 that
 hadn't
 worked
 out,
 I
 don't


think
 Sean
 and
 myself
 would
 have
 quit


because
 we
 just
 loved
 working
 on


everything
 related
 to
 crypto
 and
 uh
 we


fundamentally
 believed
 in
 the
 technology


to
 keep
 me
 not
 distracted
 from
 that


thought.
 I
 continued
 to
 uh
 talk
 to
 our


customers
 and
 partners
 and
 I
 knew
 that


they
 really
 enjoyed
 using
 our
 product


and
 they
 enjoyed
 being
 our
 customer.
 So


that
 really
 helped
 me
 not
 be
 too


distracted
 the
 runway
 problem.
 At
 the


same
 time,
 we
 felt
 like
 it
 was
 very


important
 to
 be
 transparent
 with
 our


team.
 At
 that
 time,
 we
 had
 a
 team
 size


of
 probably
 8
 to
 10.
 They're
 all
 working


very
 hard,
 super
 motivated,
 and
 really


loved
 working
 together
 with
 them.
 And
 we


let
 them
 know
 that
 there
 could
 be
 a


chance
 that
 we
 may
 not
 be
 able
 to


process
 payroll
 for
 the
 next
 month
 or


two.
 But
 it's
 our
 focus
 to
 ensure
 that


we
 uh
 extend
 our
 runway.


>> I
 think
 for
 me,
 I
 I
 believe
 in
 it
 so


much.
 If
 Ethereum
 died,
 then
 my
 company


dies
 too.
 So,
 I
 just
 built
 as
 hard
 as
 I


could.
 it
 keeps
 going
 and
 keeps
 raising


money.
 Fortunately,
 like
 we
 were
 able
 to


close
 with
 like
 close
 to
 a
 month
 of


runway
 left.
 I
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 to
 take


a
 loan.
 So,
 the
 money
 hit
 the
 bank


without
 running
 out.
 But
 at
 the
 same


time,
 I
 was
 still
 hiring.
 I
 was
 still


trying
 to
 find
 a
 new
 office
 space.
 Back


then,
 we
 were
 like
 in
 person
 in
 SF.
 I


think
 for
 me,
 it's
 like
 just
 keep


pushing
 until
 the
 last
 the
 last
 minute,


right?
 Kind
 kind
 of
 thing.
 And
 cuz
 like


I
 I
 did
 I
 did
 hear
 the
 Docker
 story
 too.


It's
 like
 they
 were
 very
 close
 to


running
 out
 and
 then
 the
 founder
 created


Docker
 as
 an
 open-
 source
 alternative


and
 then
 launched
 at
 Pyon.
 It
 was
 a
 huge


success.
 So
 really
 just
 turned
 the


company
 around.
 So
 I
 kind
 of
 believe
 in


those
 those
 very
 special
 uh
 moments
 and


yeah
 for
 me
 I
 I
 kept
 going
 both
 I


believe
 in
 the
 space
 but
 also
 just
 from


what
 I
 seen
 heard
 that
 I
 should
 just


keep
 going.
 Yeah.
 at
 the
 time
 because


the
 space
 was
 really
 small.
 There
 wasn't


a
 lot
 of
 competitors
 who
 have
 who
 had
 as


much
 as
 adoption
 as
 we
 did.
 A
 lot
 of
 our


barrier
 was
 talking
 to
 VCs
 who
 are
 not


really
 bought
 into
 the
 web
 3
 vision
 like


most
 investors
 at
 the
 time.
 It
 just


couldn't
 work.
 No matter
 how
 many


developers
 or
 dabs
 that
 we
 on
 boarded,


it
 wouldn't
 convince
 them.
 But
 there


fortunately
 still
 a
 lot
 of
 investors
 who


kind
 of
 share
 that
 vision
 and
 excitement


for
 the
 space
 who
 really
 see
 the
 saw
 the


value
 in
 us.
 Uh
 when
 you
 resonate
 from


like
 a
 fundamental
 level
 in
 terms
 of


vision
 and
 belief
 and
 they
 like
 the
 team


they
 like
 the
 technology
 and
 you're
 also


like
 kind
 of
 a
 leader
 in
 the
 category


then
 naturally
 like
 an
 investment
 will


work
 out.
 Like
 it
 was
 a
 really
 tough


time
 for
 me
 where
 where where
 I
 had
 to


like
 really
 really
 learn
 to
 fundra.


Yeah.
 Like
 that
 seed
 round
 later
 was
 so


much
 different
 from
 the
 preede
 round
 uh


earlier
 on
 just
 in
 terms
 of
 difficulty


especially
 in
 a
 in
 a
 bare
 market
 right


and
 actually
 like
 we
 had
 so
 many


competitors
 at
 the
 time
 after
 we
 started


and
 after
 the
 bare
 market
 there's
 like


only
 a
 couple
 left.
 Yeah.
 I
 think
 that


was
 the
 the
 reason
 uh
 I
 didn't
 know
 that


we
 were
 going
 to
 be
 working
 with


enterprises
 at
 first
 but
 I
 think
 it
 was


really
 important
 to
 be
 very
 secure
 and


and
 follow
 like
 compliance
 procedures.


So
 we
 were
 actually
 the
 first
 embedded


wallet
 who
 ever
 achieved
 the
 sock
 2
 type


two
 compliance
 very
 very
 early
 on
 uh


even
 though
 we
 weren't
 really
 working


with
 enterprises
 at
 the
 time
 and
 that


standard
 actually
 paved
 the
 way
 to
 us
 uh


starting
 to
 talk
 to
 enterprises
 because


when
 we
 mentioned
 that
 we
 have
 it
 as
 a


startup
 like
 they're
 they're
 impressed


right
 that
 we're
 able
 to
 achieve
 that


and
 hold
 that
 standard
 even
 till
 today


we
 are
 the
 most
 compliant
 embed
 wallet


solution
 with
 both
 socks
 type
 2
 and
 ISO


right
 uh
 standard
 which
 is
 like
 a


payment
 compliance
 standard.
 So
 I
 would


say
 that's
 the
 baseline
 right
 that's


that's
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 hard
 requirement


to
 be
 able
 to
 work
 with
 enterprises
 but


also
 over
 the
 years
 we
 were
 able
 to


develop
 a
 lot
 of
 use
 cases
 really


well-known
 success
 stories
 like
 poly


market
 helium
 Immutable
 able
 to
 get


Macy's
 Mattel
 and
 eventually
 led
 up
 to


neighbor
 but
 also
 getting
 reinvestment


from
 PayPal
 ventures
 that
 at
 the
 time


with
 the
 PayPal
 ventures
 round
 we
 were


able
 to
 raise
 uh
 over
 $80
 million
 in


funding
 throughout
 this
 whole
 period.


And
 at
 the
 time
 we
 were
 um
 working
 with


uh
 over
 30
 million
 wallets
 and
 now
 we're


like
 over
 50
 million
 over
 100,000


developers
 now
 like
 over
 200,000.
 Yeah.


That
 was
 like
 a
 great
 moment
 for
 us
 to


like
 capture
 the
 market
 opportunity
 uh


at
 the
 time.
 Yeah.
 And
 definitely
 that


gave
 us
 a
 a
 very
 a
 lot
 of
 resource
 right


for
 us
 to
 capture
 the
 market
 there.


Yeah.


I
 spend
 probably
 the
 most
 amount
 of
 time


with
 Sean
 uh
 having
 known
 him
 for
 for
 a


long
 time
 uh
 during
 our
 uh
 days
 at


Docker.
 You
 know,
 sat
 down
 together
 and


he
 kind
 of
 walked
 me
 through
 the
 broader


vision
 of
 what
 he
 was
 building.
 It


immediately
 struck
 a
 chord
 with
 me
 in


that
 consumers
 began
 to
 embrace
 uh


everything
 that
 is
 web
 3,
 real


solutions,
 real
 financial
 services
 tools


uh
 that
 can
 make
 all
 of
 our
 financial


lives
 much
 easier.
 uh
 his
 vision
 really


captured
 what
 I
 think
 was
 the
 ultimate


identity
 problem.
 And
 I
 think
 Magic's


vision
 at
 the
 time
 was
 to
 allow
 people


to
 complete
 that
 journey
 or
 that


migration
 without
 having
 to
 ask
 the


users
 change
 their
 behaviors
 or
 adopt


new
 behaviors.
 They
 don't
 have
 to
 go
 to


MetaMask,
 sign
 up
 for
 account,
 memorize


the
 20
 keyphrases,
 promptly
 forget
 them


2
 minutes
 later.
 All
 you
 have
 to
 do
 is


use
 your
 original
 login
 and
 what
 they
 do


is
 they
 spin
 up
 a
 crypto
 wallet
 for
 you


on
 the
 back
 end
 that
 allows
 you
 to


connect
 naturally
 sort
 of
 natively
 to


all
 the
 web
 3
 services.
 We
 talk
 about


what's
 the
 easiest
 adoption
 or
 way
 of


adoption.
 It's
 when
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 do


it
 anything
 differently
 and
 that's
 why
 I


think
 early
 on
 they
 were
 able
 to
 grow


the
 number
 of
 users
 or
 number
 of


identity
 as
 they
 manage
 to
 the
 millions


sort
 of
 scale
 that
 they
 were
 able
 to


achieve
 at
 the
 time
 and
 that
 I
 think


spoke
 volumes
 about
 how
 important
 that


user
 experience
 design
 is
 for
 that
 mass


adoption
 of
 web
 3.


Having
 conviction
 is
 important
 and
 the


conviction
 comes
 from
 a
 few
 places,


right?
 One,
 do
 you
 believe
 that
 the


market
 is
 large
 enough?
 They're


attacking
 a
 big
 enough
 problem.
 And
 of


course,
 having
 the
 numbers
 that
 Magic


had
 early
 on
 definitely
 gave
 us


confidence
 that
 this
 is
 tapping
 into
 a


large
 enough
 problem.
 Enough
 people
 need


access
 to
 this.
 and
 two
 uh
 like
 you


alluded
 to
 earlier
 is
 there
 a
 technical


differentiation
 or
 a
 a
 product


differentiation
 from
 the
 competitors
 and


I
 think
 the
 growth
 that
 it
 demonstrated


uh
 the
 early
 customer
 buyins
 that
 they


uh
 were
 able
 to
 get
 uh
 showed
 us
 that


there
 is
 a
 good
 amount
 of
 technical


differentiation
 like
 I
 mentioned
 having


your
 own
 private
 key
 management
 and


getting
 into
 some
 of
 the
 more
 specific


features
 which
 I
 won't
 bore
 you
 with
 is


is
 important
 right
 the
 nitty-gritty


sometimes
 do
 win
 deals
 win
 customers.


Just
 like
 your
 UX
 design
 really
 matters,


right?
 The
 little
 things,
 one
 extra
 step


in
 terms
 of
 authentication
 will
 probably


result
 in
 incremental
 but
 and
 a


significant
 amount
 of
 drop
 off
 in


conversion
 rates.
 So,
 I
 think
 paying


attention
 to
 all
 of
 those
 little


details,
 whether
 it's
 the
 feature


design,
 UX
 design,
 all
 really
 matter
 a


whole
 lot.
 Ultimately,
 it
 also
 comes


down
 to
 the
 founder
 or
 the
 founders


themselves.
 one,
 do
 you
 really
 believe


they're
 serious
 about
 building
 what


they're
 building?
 Like
 I
 mentioned


earlier,
 you
 know,
 when
 the
 market


turns,
 tourists
 tend
 to
 leave,
 right?


And
 the
 true
 believers,
 the
 true


builders
 will
 stay
 because
 they're


committed
 to
 doing
 this.
 That
 sort
 of


grit,
 that
 sort
 of
 personal
 conviction


that
 they
 demonstrated
 uh
 was
 also
 a


critical
 part
 in
 terms
 of
 getting
 me


conviction
 ultimately.
 That's
 probably


the
 three
 biggest
 things,
 right?
 You


look
 at
 overall
 size
 of
 the
 opportunity,


whether
 they
 have
 the
 right
 to
 play
 or


the
 right
 to
 win,
 but
 ultimately
 are
 the


right
 people,
 right?
 You
 can
 bet
 on
 the


right
 horse,
 but
 is
 it
 the
 right
 jockey?


So,
 I
 think
 those
 three
 things
 kind
 of


really
 converged
 on
 magic
 that
 made
 me


invest
 in
 them.


The
 most
 important
 principle
 when
 it


comes
 to
 making
 decisions
 between
 tech


and
 UX
 is
 finding
 that
 right
 balance


between
 user
 experience
 and
 technology.


I
 think
 it
 really
 comes
 down
 to
 customer


obsession.
 And
 this
 is
 one
 thing
 I


learned
 at
 Apple,
 right?
 Um,
 every


design,
 every
 step
 of
 building
 and


shipping,
 there
 was
 just
 so
 much


attention
 that
 was
 uh
 attention
 to


detail
 that
 was
 put
 into
 it.
 But
 more


importantly,
 people
 just
 really
 cared


about
 uh
 the
 user
 experience
 and
 their


customers.
 It's
 more
 like
 when
 they're


feeling
 the
 pain,
 you're
 feeling
 more


pain
 yourself.
 You
 know,
 how
 do
 you


react
 to
 that?
 You
 go
 about
 solving,


right?
 When
 you
 build
 a
 product,
 it's


not
 just
 to
 solve
 a
 problem.
 It's
 like,


of
 course,
 like
 it's
 got
 to
 solve
 a


problem,
 but
 it's
 almost
 like


storytelling.
 It's
 a
 message.
 That
 is


kind
 of
 like
 the
 soul
 of
 the
 product.


When
 I
 think
 about
 storytelling
 and
 how


a
 founder
 can
 get
 great
 at
 storytelling,


kind
 of
 why
 I
 I
 really
 gravitate
 to


naming
 the
 company
 magic,
 too.
 It's
 like


a
 magic
 show,
 right?
 It's
 kind
 of
 like
 a


performance.
 Like
 if
 you
 just
 like


showed
 everybody
 exactly
 how
 the
 magic


works,
 then
 like
 it
 won't
 be
 like,
 you


know,
 magical.


Great
 storytelling
 is
 really
 about
 that


wow
 factor.
 If
 you're
 talking
 about
 from


a
 product
 standpoint,
 you
 want
 to


identify
 what
 the
 wow
 factor
 is
 and
 show


that
 to
 your
 users
 as
 quickly
 as


possible
 and
 like
 make
 that
 a
 goal.


back
 to
 kind
 of
 the
 philosophy
 right


around
 technology
 being
 invisible.
 I
 do


envision
 a
 future
 where
 people
 can
 truly


focus
 on
 what
 they
 really
 want
 to
 do.


Like
 they're
 not
 just
 dealing
 with
 the


manual
 things
 like
 it
 would
 just
 be
 yeah


fully
 integrated
 in
 my
 day-to-day
 life


in
 a
 way
 that's
 really
 really
 simulous.


Maybe
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 like
 new


hardware
 that
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 talk
 to,


right?
 payment,
 identity,


authentication,
 those
 things
 should
 be


ambient.
 They
 should
 happen
 in
 the


background
 without
 us
 having
 to


intervene.
 Fully
 autonomous
 agents


should
 be
 able
 to
 do
 things
 without
 us


having
 to
 constantly
 look
 over
 the


shoulder.
 So
 yes,
 the
 best
 UI
 is
 an


abstraction
 of
 the
 UI
 that
 doesn't
 need


to
 prompt
 you
 for
 login,
 that
 doesn't


need
 to
 prompt
 you
 for
 approvals.
 It


should
 just
 happen
 automatically.
 In


some
 ways,
 you
 see,
 you
 know,
 we're
 in


San
 Francisco,
 right?
 We
 see
 Whimos


running
 around.
 We
 see
 Tesla
 robo
 taxis


being
 being
 uh
 tested.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


anyone
 had
 had
 experience
 with
 riding
 in


one
 lately.
 Uh
 I
 remember
 my
 first
 Whimo


trip
 a
 while
 back.
 You
 know,
 the
 initial


2
 minutes
 I
 was
 a
 little
 I
 was
 a
 little


nervous.
 Here
 I
 am
 sitting
 in
 this
 car


with
 an
 empty
 driver's
 seat
 taking
 me


through
 the
 busy
 streets
 of
 San


Francisco,
 which
 pretty
 challenging
 for


me
 as
 a
 driver.
 Now
 there's
 this
 thing


that's
 taking
 me
 around.
 But
 quickly
 I


began
 to
 really
 just
 look
 out
 the
 window


looking
 at
 a
 street
 and
 and
 got
 back
 on


my
 phone.
 I
 completely
 forgot
 I
 was


being
 driven
 around
 by
 AI.
 And
 that's


sort
 of
 the
 becoming
 ambient
 or


abstraction
 moment
 that
 happened
 for
 me


when
 it
 comes
 to
 self-driving.
 The
 best


technology
 J
 will
 put
 it
 the
 best
 UI
 is


no
 UI
 is
 an
 abstraction.
 is
 because


you've
 designed
 the
 experience,
 you've


designed
 the
 tech
 to
 be
 so
 good,
 so


secure,
 so
 seamless
 that
 users
 forgot


that
 it
 exists.
 So
 I
 think
 yes,


absolutely
 that
 philosophy
 will
 continue


to
 guide
 development
 not
 just
 within
 web


3
 but
 also
 within
 AI
 going
 forward.


>> We're
 now
 living
 through
 a
 great


emergency.
 AI
 agents
 are
 becoming


better.
 So
 that's
 how
 magic
 unit
 will


play
 a
 key
 role
 in
 this
 uh
 ecosystem.


Thank
 you.


[Applause]


>> Our
 ultimate
 goal
 for
 magic
 is
 making


technology
 feel
 invisible.
 Sean
 and
 my


vision
 still
 hasn't
 changed
 to
 this
 day


and
 we
 continue
 to
 believe
 in
 our
 vision


being
 realized.
 One
 thing
 that
 I
 would


say
 has
 expanded
 is
 we're
 now
 not
 just


thinking
 about
 humans,
 we're
 also


thinking
 about
 AI
 agents.
 In
 five
 years


from
 now,
 what
 we
 see
 is
 it'll
 be
 your


AI
 agents
 or
 multiple
 AI
 agents
 pretty


much
 managing
 your
 money,
 managing
 your


contracts,
 booking
 travels,
 and
 doing


all
 the
 daily
 activities
 that
 you
 do


today,
 being
 fully
 automated
 through
 AI


agents.
 But
 Newton
 will
 ensure
 that
 they


operate
 within
 the
 guardrails
 that
 you


have
 set.
 You're
 able
 to
 trust
 that
 AI


agent
 is
 making
 the
 right
 decisions
 and


right
 actions
 even
 while
 you're
 asleep.


like
 magic
 already
 solved
 onboarding


with
 crypto
 and
 with
 AI
 we
 see
 crypto


being
 the
 main
 rails
 for
 the
 agentic
 AI


and
 that's
 where
 mutant
 comes
 in.
 So


mutant
 is
 a
 trust
 layer
 that
 acts
 as
 a


policy
 engine
 defining
 and
 enforcing


programmable
 rules
 such
 that
 users
 and


AI
 agents
 can
 safely
 and
 autonomously


interact
 with
 blockchains.
 So
 think
 of


mutant
 as
 system
 on
 your
 phone.
 So
 you


get
 to
 control
 apps
 that
 can
 access
 your


location
 and
 use
 your
 camera
 and
 send


notifications
 etc.
 So
 with
 Newton,


you're
 able
 to
 set
 these
 permissions.


Just
 trust
 that
 AI
 will
 be
 able
 to


safely
 interact
 with
 blockchains
 on


behalf
 of
 you.


>> I
 would
 say
 my
 biggest
 learning
 was
 that


um
 progress
 is
 not
 linear.
 I
 always
 like


to
 make
 this
 like
 battlefield
 analogy.


You're
 like
 fighting
 a
 campaign,
 right?


And
 you
 don't
 really
 know
 too
 much
 about


the
 landscape.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 fog


of
 war.
 You
 know,
 in
 Starcraft,
 you


don't
 really
 see,
 right,
 the
 map
 until


you
 kind
 of
 explore
 it.
 All
 you
 see
 is


this
 hill,
 right,
 that
 you
 can
 get
 on


top
 of.
 So
 maybe
 you
 get
 on
 top
 of
 the


hill,
 you
 can
 see
 more.
 Like
 you
 can


remove
 some
 fog
 of
 war
 and
 see
 more.


It's
 like,
 oh,
 maybe
 this
 is
 not
 the


right
 hill.
 I
 need
 to
 go
 there.
 And
 then


you
 go
 there
 and
 then
 it's
 like
 a
 little


bit
 higher
 and
 you
 can
 see
 more


visibility
 into
 this
 landscape.
 But
 if


you
 don't
 take
 any
 actions
 to
 explore


this
 fog
 of
 war,
 then
 maybe
 you
 get


crushed,
 right?
 like
 you
 don't
 really


know
 what's
 going
 on.
 So
 inaction
 is


actually
 not
 an
 option.
 So
 you
 have
 to


like
 constantly
 keep
 going,
 keep


exploring,
 keep
 learning,
 keep


iterating,
 keep
 pivoting.
 Sometimes
 it


feels
 like
 180.
 Sometimes
 if
 Yeah,
 it


just
 feels
 it's
 like
 a
 very
 chaotic
 and


unpredictable
 process.
 Where
 you
 end
 up


is
 never
 where
 you
 start.
 And
 most
 of


the
 greatest
 companies
 have
 gone
 like


through
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 very
 drastic


pivots,
 right?
 So
 I
 think
 that
 would
 be


the
 biggest
 advice.
 Kind
 of
 think
 of
 it


from
 that
 perspective.
 Commit
 to
 your


mission,
 right?
 Commit
 to
 what
 you


believe
 in
 your
 principles,
 but


extremely
 flexible
 on
 your
 strategy
 and


and
 approach.
 I
 think
 that
 should
 be


like
 the
 right
 balance.
 Yeah.


>> If
 I
 could
 go
 back,


I
 would
 tell
 myself
 to
 really
 stress


test
 how
 deeply
 I
 care
 about
 the
 problem


that
 I'm
 solving
 and
 how
 badly
 I
 want
 to


own
 my
 own
 destiny.
 Because
 the
 truth
 is


when
 it
 comes
 to
 startups,
 there
 will
 be


a
 lot
 of
 pain.
 When
 I
 had
 joined,
 I
 was


just
 excited
 about
 building
 cool
 stuff


and
 I
 did
 not
 know
 that
 I
 was
 going
 to


go
 through
 so
 much
 pain.
 But
 what
 really


kept
 me
 to
 here
 and
 I
 know
 that
 I'll


stick
 it
 through
 until
 the
 end
 is
 and


how
 much
 I
 care
 about
 the
 vision
 and
 the


problem
 that
 we're
 looking
 to
 solve.
 The


other
 part
 that
 I
 would
 tell
 myself
 is


you
 got
 to
 be
 really
 obsessed
 uh
 with


the
 problem
 and
 you
 got
 to
 be
 obsessed


with
 building
 what
 matters.
 If
 you're


not
 obsessed,
 then
 it'll
 be
 really
 hard


to
 make
 it
 through.
 It's
 like
 a
 roller


coaster
 where
 there
 will
 be
 highs
 when


you
 feel
 amazing,
 but
 there
 will
 be
 a


lot
 more
 lows
 where
 it'll
 feel
 brutal.


So,
 if
 you
 have
 other
 goals,
 you're


trying
 to
 make
 money
 doing
 a
 startup,
 I


would
 advise
 not
 to
 do
 that.
 It
 really


has
 to
 be
 something
 that
 you're
 so


passionate
 about
 that
 you
 would
 wake
 up


every
 day
 thinking
 about
 it.
 It's
 not


just
 a
 job.
 Like,
 it
 has
 to
 become
 your


life.
 So,
 it
 is
 big
 commitment.
 It's
 not


for
 me
 to
 scare
 people,
 but
 it's
 also


for
 me
 to
 just
 let
 people
 know
 that
 it's


going
 to
 be
 a
 long
 journey,
 but
 I
 can


guarantee
 that
 it's
 worth
 it.


Yeah,
 the
 truth
 is
 like
 a
 person's


personal
 motivation
 should
 evolve
 right


over
 the
 course
 of
 years.
 Yes,
 like
 I


think
 my
 excitement
 about
 the
 future
 of


web
 3,
 steady
 drum
 beat,
 right?
 That


pushes
 me
 forward.
 But
 just
 in
 terms
 of


sometimes,
 you
 know,
 when
 things
 get


difficult,
 there's
 all
 these
 like


personal
 motivations
 that
 come
 in
 play,


right?
 When
 I
 first
 started,
 I
 tried
 to


remind
 myself
 uh
 why
 I
 got
 in
 like
 I


wanted
 to
 develop
 these
 skill
 sets,
 make


more
 impact.
 I
 want
 to
 grow
 to
 be
 a


leader.
 I
 want
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 work
 with


other
 people
 better.
 So
 in
 the
 beginning


that
 motivates
 me
 and
 then
 later
 on
 were


pioneers
 for
 embedded
 wallet.
 Uh
 I
 want


to
 take
 it
 as
 a
 new
 challenge
 to
 see
 if


I
 can
 create
 a
 second
 album
 right
 with


Newton
 protocol.
 So
 I
 I
 took
 that
 as
 a


as
 a
 personal
 challenge
 as
 well
 and
 we


were
 able
 to
 to
 deliver
 on
 that
 too
 and


to
 me
 that's
 like
 very
 fulfilling
 right


uh
 personally
 and
 I
 think
 you
 know
 as
 we


continue
 to
 grow
 and
 and
 evolve
 we're


going
 to
 find
 like
 other
 motivations
 as


well
 but
 yeah
 like
 those
 are
 just
 a
 few


examples
 and
 there's
 just
 so
 much
 more


along
 the
 way.
 Yeah.
