Your
 royal
 highness


m
 president
 al
 madame
 governor
 of


oldenbida


madame
 l
 minist


dear
 Mrs.
 whom


I'll
 switch
 to
 English


rest
 assured.
 So
 ladies
 and
 gentlemen,


it
 is
 a
 great
 great
 pleasure
 to
 be
 back


at
 Nesbank.
 I
 was
 here
 almost
 10
 years


ago
 for
 the
 200th
 anniversary
 and
 I'm


delighted
 to
 be
 back
 particularly
 for


the
 first
 conference
 organized
 by
 noises


bank
 and
 not
 just
 uh
 investment
 fund.


So
 when
 I
 last
 visited


the
 central
 bank
 back
 in
 the
 summer
 of


2016,


the
 world
 and
 Europe
 was
 in
 a
 slightly


different
 place.


Backtrack
 a
 little
 bit.
 Remember
 about


10
 years
 ago
 the
 Paris
 agreement,
 the


international
 treaty
 to
 reduce


greenhouse
 gas
 emission
 was
 hardly
 one


year
 old


and
 it
 enjoyed
 strong
 support
 from
 all


major
 powers
 around
 the
 world.


A
 benign
 geopolitical
 environment
 also


blurred
 the
 risks
 of
 Europe's
 growing


energy
 dependencies.
 Nordstream
 2.
 A
 new


gas
 pipeline
 project
 had
 recently
 been


announced,
 promising
 to
 deliver
 plenty


cheap
 Russian
 gas
 to
 the
 continent.


Fast
 forward
 to
 today
 and
 see
 how
 many


differences
 we
 are
 facing
 and
 how
 the


world
 has
 dramatically
 changed
 in


dramatic
 ways.


We
 are
 witnessing
 a
 backlash
 against


green
 initiatives.


The
 war
 in
 Ukraine
 has
 further
 exposed


Europe's
 energy
 dependencies
 as


strategic
 vulnerabilities


driving
 up
 gas
 prices
 after
 the
 cutoff


of
 the
 Russian
 pipeline
 supply.
 And
 who


knows
 what's
 happening
 under
 the
 water


level.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 energy
 prices
 have


risen
 sharply
 since
 gas
 sets
 the


marginal
 price
 in
 the
 EU
 energy
 market


for
 most
 of
 the
 time.


In
 this
 new
 environment,
 many
 countries


face
 an
 increasingly
 difficult
 tradeoff


between
 three
 energy
 goals
 that
 I
 will


call
 my
 energy
 trilmna.


My
 team
 argues
 that
 I
 should
 not
 really


use
 trilmna
 because
 in
 a
 trilmna
 you


can't
 really
 escape
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 try


to
 show
 you
 that
 we
 can
 escape
 the


trilmna.
 So
 what
 are
 the
 three
 angles
 of


the
 trilmna?


We
 need
 energy
 that
 is
 secure
 because


the
 geopolitical
 reality
 has
 changed


dramatically.
 We
 need
 energy
 that
 is


sustainable
 because
 the
 climate
 reality


has
 not
 changed
 or
 some
 would
 argue
 that


it
 has
 changed
 for
 the
 worse.


And
 we
 need
 energy
 that
 is
 affordable


because
 households
 and
 corporates
 need


it.


Ultimately,


only
 clean
 energy
 has
 the
 potential
 to


deliver
 on
 all
 three
 goals


of
 my
 trilmna.
 As
 Norway
 actually


demonstrates,


the
 share
 of
 renewable
 in
 energy


consumption
 here
 in
 this
 country
 ranks


amongst
 the
 highest
 in
 the
 world.
 While


household
 energy
 prices,
 I
 know
 highly


debated
 on
 the
 subject
 of
 controversy


during
 the
 political
 campaign,
 but


remember
 they
 are
 still
 around
 23
 of
 the


EU
 average.


Norway
 can
 inspire
 the
 European
 Union


and
 demonstrate
 that
 it
 is
 possible
 if


we
 remain
 ambitious
 to
 move
 towards
 that


green
 transition
 that
 would
 address
 the


three
 angles
 of
 the
 trilmna


because
 a
 successful
 transition
 to
 a


renewable-based
 system
 comes
 with
 many


benefits.


It
 also
 requires
 a
 massive
 investment


push.
 The
 faster
 policy
 makers
 can


create
 an
 environment
 in
 which
 such


investment
 can
 flourish,
 the
 easier
 and


less
 costly
 the
 transition
 will
 be.
 Now


I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 for
 your
 indulgence


because
 I
 will
 quote
 Ulav
 Hoger


who
 wrote


Yeah,
 forgive
 me.
 I'll
 try.


Ah,
 thank
 you.


One
 person
 understood
 what
 I
 said.


Thank
 you,
 Madame
 Minister.


So,
 for
 those
 of
 you
 who
 have
 not


qualified
 yet
 in
 Norwegian,
 what
 it


means
 is
 badly
 pronounced
 by
 me,
 this
 is


your
 road
 and
 it
 is
 impossible
 to
 turn


back.


So
 today
 what
 I
 will
 do
 with
 you
 is


explore
 from
 a
 central
 banker's
 point
 of


view
 how
 Europe's
 road
 to
 renewable
 can


deliver
 powerful
 benefits
 if
 we
 unlock


the
 right
 conditions.
 So
 I
 will
 look
 in


turn
 at
 the
 landscape
 as
 we
 have
 it
 at


the
 moment.
 What
 the
 promises
 and
 the


challenges
 are
 and
 what
 the
 financing


needs
 are
 and
 how
 they
 can
 be
 addressed.


I'll
 try
 to
 gallop
 through
 my
 remarks


because
 I
 know
 that
 time
 is
 pressing
 and


my
 friend
 colleague
 much
 admired
 vice


president
 Al
 Gore
 needs
 to
 take
 the


floor
 for
 longer
 than
 me.


So
 before
 horrible
 Russia's
 invasion
 of


Ukraine
 Europe's
 de
 facto
 prioritized


two
 elements
 of
 the
 trilmna


sustainability
 and
 affordability.


We
 didn't
 really
 think
 very
 much
 about


security,
 not
 in
 the
 terms
 that
 we're


thinking
 about
 it
 now.
 So,
 as
 part
 of


its
 fit
 for
 55
 targets,
 the
 EU
 aimed
 to


raise
 the
 share
 of
 renewables
 in
 its


energy
 consumption
 to
 as
 much
 as
 45%
 in


2030.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 almost
 half
 of


the
 gas
 imports
 came
 from
 Russia.


The
 combination
 kept
 energy
 cost


contained,
 facilitating
 as
 a
 result


Europe
 competitiveness.


Energy
 remained
 relatively
 cheap
 for


energy
 intensive
 industries
 and
 those


periods
 of
 intermittency,
 you
 know,
 when


renewable
 output
 was
 low
 and
 gas
 served


as
 a
 backup
 did
 not
 lead
 to
 significant


price
 volatility.


But
 we
 ultimately
 paid
 the
 price
 for


neglecting
 the
 third
 goal,
 which
 is


energy
 security.
 When
 the
 geopolitical


context
 changed,
 the
 consequences
 for


our
 economy
 were
 severe.
 Consequences


that
 we
 as
 central
 bankers
 had
 to
 face


and
 combat.


First,
 we
 saw
 a
 surge
 of
 inflation.


Energy
 inflation
 in
 the
 Euro
 area
 surged


to
 37
 surged
 to
 37%
 in
 22,
 pushing


headline
 inflation
 for
 a
 record
 of
 8.4%


that
 year.
 So
 in
 response,
 what
 all


central
 banks
 had
 to
 do
 was
 to


significantly
 respond
 by
 implementing


the
 fastest
 monetary
 tightening
 in
 the


history
 of
 the
 ECB
 in
 order
 to
 bring


inflation
 back
 under
 control.
 And
 I'm


pleased
 to
 say
 that
 we
 have
 managed
 to


do
 that
 and
 it
 is
 now
 under
 control
 at


our
 medium-term
 target
 and
 it
 will
 stay


there.


Now
 surging
 energy
 prices
 led
 to
 a


second
 consequence.
 They
 have
 reduced


Europe's
 competitiveness.


Although
 the
 acute
 phase
 of
 the
 energy


shock
 has
 passed,
 the
 new
 geopolitical


reality
 has
 left
 a
 lasting
 imprint
 on


Europe's
 energy
 cost,
 weakening
 its


position
 relative
 to
 other
 regions
 of


the
 world.
 Electricity
 prices
 in
 the
 EU


remain
 about
 two
 and
 a
 half
 times
 higher


than
 in
 the
 United
 States
 and
 gas
 prices


almost
 four
 times
 higher
 than
 in
 the


United
 States.
 This
 gap
 is
 is
 shaping


how
 firms
 invest,
 how
 firms
 innovate,


and
 even
 where
 they
 choose
 to
 locate


their
 operations.


Our
 research
 at
 the
 ECB
 shows
 that


European
 firms
 significantly
 reduce


their
 capital
 and
 research
 and


development
 expenditure
 in
 response
 to


energy
 shocks.
 Unlike
 their
 US


counterparts,


there
 are
 growing
 concerns
 that
 higher


energy
 prices
 may
 also
 be
 contributing


to
 the
 disindustrialization


as
 European
 firm
 struggles
 struggle


against
 foreign
 competition


and
 higher
 energy
 prices
 make
 it
 harder


for
 Europe
 to
 full
 to
 fully
 embrace
 the


new
 technologies
 that
 will
 drive
 future


productivity
 and
 by
 that
 I
 mean


artificial
 intelligence.


So
 it
 is
 essential
 to
 bring
 energy
 cost


down
 if
 we
 are
 to
 safeguard
 Europe's


industrial
 competitiveness,
 its
 high


level
 of
 research
 and
 development
 and


leverage
 artificial
 intelligence.


And
 I'm
 confident
 that
 we
 can,
 but
 we


cannot
 do
 so
 by
 trading
 off
 other
 goals.


We
 must
 ensure
 that
 our
 energy
 sources


are
 secure,


that
 our
 energy
 is
 sustainable,
 and
 that


it
 is
 affordable.
 the
 triilima
 that
 I


told
 you
 about.


The
 only
 viable
 path
 for
 Europe
 to


achieve
 these
 objectives
 is
 to
 rely
 more


on
 locally
 clean
 energy.
 This
 path
 could


help
 meet
 the
 three
 goals
 of
 the


trilmna.


First,
 renewables
 alongside
 other
 clean


technologies
 for
 producing
 electricity


are
 central
 to
 any
 credible
 plan
 to


reduce
 the
 impact
 of
 climate
 change.


Second,
 renewables
 offer
 level
 of
 energy


independence
 that
 given
 our
 lack
 of


natural
 resources,
 Europe
 would
 never


reach
 with
 imported
 fossile
 fuel.
 And


third,
 as
 a
 marginal
 as
 the
 marginal


cost
 of
 renewable
 electricity
 is
 close


to
 zero,
 a
 system
 based
 largely
 on


renewables
 should
 ultimately
 bring
 down


energy
 prices.


But
 we
 all
 know
 that
 there
 is
 some


skepticism
 about
 all
 that
 and
 skepticism


as
 to
 whether
 such
 price
 reductions
 are


really
 possible
 in
 Europe
 over
 the
 short


to
 medium
 term.


And
 the
 key
 issue
 is
 that
 building
 and


operating
 a
 renewablesbased
 system


involves
 significant
 additional
 expenses


that
 are
 known
 as
 the
 system
 costs
 which


are
 based
 on
 the
 on
 which
 are
 passed


onto
 the
 energy
 bills.
 So
 what
 are
 these


costs?
 Those
 system
 costs


they
 come
 from
 different
 sources.
 Some


of
 those
 costs
 are
 unavoidable,


unavoidable,
 but
 others
 can
 be
 minimized


if
 we
 are
 truly
 ambitious
 with
 the


transition.
 The
 unavoidable
 costs


include
 massive
 investment
 in
 new


generation
 capacity
 and
 modernized
 grid.


The
 European
 Commission
 estimates
 that


these
 will
 require
 an
 annual
 investment


of
 nearly
 150
 billion
 euros.
 And
 that


number
 may
 even
 rise
 if
 restrictions
 on


critical
 raw
 materials
 increase
 input


cost
 or
 delay
 projects.


But
 that's
 not
 the
 only
 cost.
 And
 there


are
 other
 costs
 that
 can
 be
 minimized.


For
 instance,
 the
 cost
 related
 to
 the


inherent
 intermittency
 of
 renewables.


Intermittency
 leads
 to
 higher
 price


volatility
 which
 ultimately
 feeds
 into


higher
 average
 bills
 which
 contributes


to
 inflation
 which
 is
 a
 cause
 for


concern
 for
 a
 central
 banker.
 We
 saw


this
 in
 November
 last
 year
 when
 low
 wind


output
 across
 much
 of
 Europe
 especially


in
 Germany
 prompted
 a
 surge
 in
 gas
 fired


generation
 to
 meet
 demand.
 electricity


prices
 jumped
 in
 several
 countries
 and


the
 effects
 were
 felt
 across
 Europe


including
 in
 uh
 some
 parts
 of
 Norway.


There
 are
 also
 costs
 associated
 with


curtailment
 when
 renewable
 output
 is


deliberately
 reduced
 to
 keep
 the
 system


balanced
 which
 often
 results
 in
 payment


to
 providers.


The
 European
 Commission
 estimates
 that


by
 2040
 we
 could
 lose
 up
 to
 10
 times


more
 renewable
 energy
 generation
 than
 we


lose
 today
 owing
 to
 grid
 constraints.


But
 these
 cost
 should
 not
 hold
 us
 back


from
 staying
 the
 course.
 And
 there
 are


three
 reasons
 why
 I'm
 optimistic
 that


Europe
 can
 overcome
 these
 challenges.


First,


while
 we
 cannot
 eliminate
 the
 cost


associated
 with
 intermittency,


we
 cannot
 control
 the
 weather.
 We
 can


substantially
 reduce
 them
 if
 we
 push


through
 with
 the
 investment
 in


generation
 capacity,
 grids
 and
 storage.


I
 was
 at
 the
 IMF
 last
 week,
 annual


meetings.
 I
 asked
 the
 head
 of
 European


department,
 if
 you
 had
 to
 make
 one


change,
 the
 first
 one
 that
 you
 would


make,
 what
 is
 it?
 Invest
 in
 grids.


Instant
 response.


[Music]


One
 of
 our
 studies
 estimates
 that
 if


European
 countries
 meet
 their
 solar
 and


wind
 targets,
 electricity
 prices
 could


fall
 by
 more
 than
 a
 quarter
 by
 2030
 and


become
 less
 volatile
 owing
 to
 a
 weaker


link
 between
 electricity
 and
 gas
 prices.


Curtailment
 costs
 that
 I
 have
 just


mentioned
 would
 also
 fall
 as
 research


finds
 that
 each
 euro
 invested
 in


upgrading
 the
 electricity
 grid


translates
 into
 over
 €2
 saved
 in
 systems


cost.


Second
 infrastructure
 investment
 could


be
 particularly
 effective
 in
 Europe


owing
 to
 what?
 To
 our
 geographic


diversity.


Southern
 Europe
 performs
 strongly
 in


solar
 power
 while
 northern
 and
 Atlantic


coastal
 regions
 excel
 in
 wind
 energy.


You
 have
 the
 second
 largest
 coastal


treasure
 in
 Norway
 and
 wind
 energy
 seems


particularly
 propitious
 to
 that.
 I
 know


it's
 controversial
 as
 well.
 It's


controversial
 in
 my
 country
 too.


But
 deeper
 energy
 market
 integration,


for example,
 through
 more
 crossber


interconnectors
 would
 let
 countries


share
 surplus
 electricity,
 smooth


fluctuations
 from
 interminent


intermittent
 sources
 and
 use
 generation


and
 grid
 capacity
 more
 efficiently.


Research
 underlines
 the
 benefits.
 Deeper


crossber
 integration
 is
 found
 to
 cut


overall
 systems
 cost
 by
 around
 9%
 which


is
 the
 equivalent
 of
 26
 billion
 annually


and
 it
 reduces
 electricity
 prices
 more


than
 isolated
 national
 approaches.
 So
 a


collective
 approach
 and
 the


interconnection
 into
 a
 grid
 system
 that


is
 more
 efficient
 is
 part
 of
 the
 answer.


Third
 element
 the
 technology
 is
 moving


in
 our
 favor.
 Not
 only
 are
 renewable


solutions
 becoming
 much
 cheaper,
 but
 the


ability
 to
 store
 renewable
 energy


through
 periods
 of
 intermittency
 is
 also


improving
 fast.
 The
 International
 Energy


Agency
 finds
 that
 the
 cost
 of
 clean


technologies
 has
 fallen
 more
 than
 half


over
 the
 past
 decade
 and
 that
 battery


pack
 costs
 are
 now
 roughly
 a
 tenth
 of


what
 they
 were
 15
 years
 ago.


So
 while
 there
 are
 costs
 that
 we
 have
 to


reckon
 with,
 Europe
 is
 also
 well


positioned
 to
 overcome
 some
 of
 them.
 And


if
 we
 manage
 to
 quickly
 unlock
 the


investment
 needed
 to
 build
 a
 world-class


renewable
 infrastructures,
 Europe
 Europe


can
 keep
 those
 other
 cost
 while


maximizing
 the
 benefits
 of
 renewables.


So
 what
 is
 missing


as
 usual?
 Money.


How
 can
 we
 unlock
 the
 investment?


It's
 not
 that
 liquidity
 are
 short.
 It's


not
 that
 investment


are
 not
 directed
 to
 projects.


But
 I
 think
 that
 we
 policy
 makers
 and


I'm
 talking
 here
 about
 both
 fiscal


authorities
 and
 monetary
 authorities.
 We


must
 provide
 two
 things.
 First,
 the


right
 environment
 for
 financing.


If
 we
 factor
 in
 decarbonization,


industry,
 transport
 and
 energy
 supply,


the
 financing
 needs
 for
 the
 green


transition
 are
 massive.


The
 private
 sector
 will
 have
 to
 account


for
 at
 least
 twothirds
 of
 this


investment.


But
 even
 though
 Europe
 has
 ample


savings,


current
 financing
 arrangements
 are
 not


channeling
 supply
 towards
 demand.


Nearly
 four
 in
 10
 European
 firms
 see
 the


lack
 of
 investor
 willingness
 to
 finance


green
 investment
 as
 a
 very
 significant


obstacle.


So
 the
 missing
 link
 in
 our
 view
 is
 a


proper
 functioning
 capital
 market.


Debt
 and
 more
 importantly
 equity


financing
 currently
 rank
 lowest
 among


the
 funding
 sources
 that
 firms
 expect
 to


use
 for
 green
 investment.


Deepening
 and
 integrating
 EU
 capital


markets
 is
 critical
 to
 support
 the


large-scale
 investments
 that
 we
 need.


The
 good
 news
 from
 where
 I
 sit
 and
 what


I
 can
 observe
 is
 that
 there
 is
 political


momentum
 behind
 the
 capital
 market
 union


and
 it
 has
 never
 been
 greater.
 Now
 the


skeptics
 will
 say
 hi
 you've
 been
 talking


about
 it
 for
 10
 years.
 Well,
 I
 can
 tell


you
 for
 having
 witnessed
 this
 for
 10


years,
 it
 has
 never
 been
 so
 high.
 It
 has


never
 been
 so


decisive
 in
 terms
 of
 we
 need
 to
 do
 it


now.


Those
 of
 you
 who
 follow
 Chancellor
 Mertz


will
 have
 seen
 his
 comment
 from
 last


week.


One
 single
 market
 for
 capital
 union.
 He


said
 one
 single
 stock
 market
 even
 and


one
 single
 super
 supervision
 authority.


Second
 policy
 makers
 need
 to
 create
 a


predictable
 environment
 for
 investment.


Investment
 will
 not
 step
 forward
 if
 the


green
 transition
 is
 clouded
 by


uncertainty
 especially
 if
 they
 are
 also


growing
 push
 back


against
 green
 initiatives
 in
 other
 parts


of
 the
 world.
 So
 we
 must
 reduce


uncertainty
 where
 it
 is
 possible.
 So


creating
 the
 right
 environment
 begins


with
 well
 three
 elements
 again


credibility,


speed
 and
 confidence.


Following
 through
 on
 existing
 green


targets
 and
 maintaining
 a
 stable
 carbon


price
 very
 important
 for
 the


credibility.
 Wavering
 on
 those


commitments
 would
 risk
 chilling


investment
 just
 when
 we
 need
 it
 the


most.


Credibility
 must
 be
 matched
 by
 speed.


Across
 Europe,
 investment
 investors
 face


slow
 and
 fragmented
 permitting


procedures
 that
 delay
 progress.


In
 some
 member
 states
 in
 Europe,


completing
 the
 permitting
 process
 can


take
 up
 to
 5
 years
 for
 utility
 scale


solar
 photovoltaic
 projects
 and
 up
 to


nine
 years
 for
 onshore
 wind.
 We
 must


shorten
 these
 timelines
 if
 the
 EU
 is
 to


meet
 its
 green
 goals.


Finally,
 policy
 makers
 must
 build


confidence
 in
 future
 electricity
 demand.


For
 instance,
 in
 Europe,
 electricity


still
 faces
 higher
 taxes
 than
 gas,


discouraging
 electrification.


And
 while
 this
 gap
 will
 narrow
 as
 carbon


pricing
 is
 extended
 to
 heating
 fuels,


governments
 can
 already
 act
 by
 lowering


electricity
 taxes


and
 moving
 it
 to
 other
 energy
 sources.


Central
 banks
 can
 also
 contribute
 to


this
 confidence
 because
 obviously
 for


investors
 in
 green
 technology,
 in
 green


projects,
 in
 transition
 measures,
 the


predictability
 of
 price
 stability
 is


vital.


Much
 more
 so
 in
 that
 sector
 of


investment
 than
 in
 others


to
 deliver
 on
 those
 policy
 makers
 have


to
 be
 courageous.


And
 I
 hope
 this
 will
 not
 be
 in
 short


supply
 because
 we
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 it.
 So


let
 me
 conclude.


Europe's
 recent
 energy
 crisis
 has


revealed
 a
 hard
 truth.
 Our
 dependence
 on


imported
 fossil
 fuels
 is
 no
 longer


sustainable.
 An
 accelerating
 climate


crisis
 makes
 this
 lesson
 even
 clearer.


But
 we're
 not
 a
 prisoner
 of
 the
 dilemma


of
 the
 trilmna.
 We
 have
 the
 agency
 to


shape
 our
 future
 here.
 Renewables
 offer


the
 clearest
 path
 to
 minimize
 the


trade-off
 between
 energy
 policy
 goals
 of


security,
 sustainability,
 and


affordability.
 And
 pushing
 ahead
 with


renewable
 is
 also
 strongly
 supported
 by


citizens.


Listen
 to
 that
 number.
 Nearly
 nine
 in
 10


Europeans
 want
 the
 EU
 to
 expand


renewable
 energy.


Some
 of
 the
 cost
 associated
 with
 the


transition,
 such
 as
 the
 required


investment,
 will
 be
 unavoidable.
 But
 if


we
 create
 the
 ideal
 conditions
 in
 which


that
 investment
 can
 flourish,
 we
 can


ensure
 that
 the
 transition
 remains


cost-effective.


Our
 regreted
 anthropologist
 Jane


Goodall,
 who
 sadly
 passed
 away
 this


month,
 reminded
 us,
 she
 said,
 "What
 you


do
 makes
 a
 difference,
 and
 you
 have
 to


decide
 what
 difference
 you
 want
 to


make."
 So
 Europe
 must
 now
 decide
 either


we
 remain
 with
 that
 unsustainable
 and


expensive
 status
 quo
 or
 we
 create
 an


environment
 that
 can
 unlock
 the


investment
 needed
 for
 sustainable,


secure
 and
 affordable
 energy.
 I
 hope
 we


have
 that
 courage
 and
 that


determination.
 Thank
 you.
