hi
 everybody
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 of
 the


Norwegian
 SN
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today
 we


are
 going
 to
 talk
 to
 Andy
 Craig
 probably


the
 world
 leading
 expert
 on
 storytelling


in
 business
 and
 the
 thing
 is
 during
 the


weekend
 we
 are
 so
 funny
 anecdotes
 funny


stories
 you
 know
 all
 these
 kind
 of


things
 we
 get
 into
 the
 office
 and
 we
 are


so


boring
 and
 so
 Andy
 tell
 us
 why
 is
 that


it
 can
 be
 any
 number
 of
 reasons
 but
 I


think
 sometimes
 we
 forget
 what
 makes
 us


great
 communicators
 on
 the
 weekends
 and


we
 leave
 that
 at
 the
 office
 door
 on


Monday
 mornings
 so
 if
 you
 just
 think


back
 to
 the
 weekends
 what
 makes
 us


really
 good
 our
 language
 is
 simpler
 it's


much
 more
 conversational
 we're
 to
 the


point
 more
 often
 than
 not
 and
 most


importantly
 we
 tell
 stories
 stories
 that


illustrate
 our
 point
 that
 have
 vivid


concrete
 details
 to
 them
 and
 that
 is
 a


way
 of
 making
 your
 communication
 more


natural
 more
 human
 more
 authentic
 more


engaging
 so
 what
 weekend
 language
 really


is
 is
 the
 conversational
 translation
 of


all
 that
 jargon
 all
 that
 dense


PowerPoint
 slide
 material
 the
 three
 four


and
 five
 litter
 acronyms
 that
 sometimes


find
 its
 way
 into
 our
 presentations
 and


conversations
 on
 the
 weekday
 why
 do
 we


switch
 I
 think
 it
 could
 be
 anything
 from


stress
 from
 anxiety
 from
 pressure
 inside


the
 organization
 from
 not
 feeling
 like


perhaps
 we
 have
 permission
 but
 a
 lot
 of


is
 just
 baked
 into
 the
 fabric
 of


business
 communication
 where
 jargon


leads
 the
 way
 and
 I
 have
 really
 two


fundamental
 challenges
 with
 jargon
 the


first
 is
 it
 creates
 a
 crushing
 sameness


if
 every
 single
 company
 is
 the
 leading


provider
 of
 mission
 critical
 seam
 of


solutions
 that
 optimize
 monetize
 and


operationalize
 businesses
 with
 robust


intelligence
 and
 actionable
 intelligence


and
 a
 10x
 Improvement
 then
 nobody
 is


that
 and
 then
 the
 second
 really
 the
 big


challenge
 is
 that
 hey
 first
 all
 tell
 me


you
 you
 used
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 used
 a
 lot
 of


super
 boring
 bargain
 there
 but
 what
 is


like
 what's
 the
 worst
 jargon
 you
 know
 I


think
 optimize
 is
 a
 is
 a
 particular
 uh


least
 favorite
 of
 mine


monetize
 really
 you
 see
 today
 people


using
 transformation
 a
 lot


transformational
 transformative
 you
 can


see
 this
 right
 at
 the
 heart
 of
 AI
 we're


kind
 of
 going
 back
 through
 many
 of
 the


same
 cycles
 of
 jargon
 and
 communication


barriers
 that
 we
 did
 maybe
 during
 the


dotc
 movement
 it's
 we're
 back
 in
 a
 cycle


and
 it's
 because
 it's
 complex
 it
 it's


really
 difficult
 it
 takes
 a
 lot
 of
 work


to
 take
 an
 idea
 a
 technology
 a
 business


model
 from
 complex
 to
 Crystal
 Clear
 and


so
 you
 see
 people
 trying
 to
 punch
 out
 of


this
 bag
 and
 if
 you
 look
 across
 many


different
 AI
 companies
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


creating
 transformative
 experiences
 why


do
 so
 many
 companies
 use
 the
 same
 boring


jargon
 I
 think
 it's
 easy
 I
 think
 one
 is


it's
 easy
 it
 doesn't
 take
 a
 lot
 of
 work


the
 flip
 side
 of
 that
 is
 it's
 really


difficult
 to
 translate


something
 into
 simple
 clear
 compelling


communication
 so
 that's
 the
 first
 part


the
 second
 part
 is
 oftentimes
 people


feel
 like
 they
 if
 I
 don't
 use
 this


language
 I
 won't
 be
 one
 of
 the
 mix
 I


won't
 be
 in
 the
 game
 so
 it's
 it's
 almost


you're
 acknowledging
 that
 you
 want
 to
 be


the
 same
 as
 other
 people
 and
 I
 met
 a
 lot


of
 salespeople
 who
 want
 to
 compete
 uh


with
 the
 same
 product
 that
 is
 described


in
 the
 same
 way
 now
 you're
 competing
 on


price
 in
 organization
 is
 it
 the
 same


between
 kind
 of
 buses
 and
 people
 further


down
 do
 we
 have
 the
 same
 problem
 I
 I


believe
 we
 do
 and
 I
 think
 the
 the


organizations
 that
 I've
 seen
 make
 the


most
 progress


in
 removing
 the
 jargon
 removing
 the


dense
 PowerPoint
 slides
 getting
 the


inside
 language
 out
 of
 the
 way
 to


something
 more
 compelling
 something


clearer
 are
 those
 that
 start
 at
 the
 top


it's
 like
 anything
 else
 in
 business
 the


person
 midlevel
 or
 below
 needs
 to
 feel


like
 they
 have
 permission
 to
 speak
 in
 a


to
 use
 different
 language
 many
 times
 and


more
 accessible
 language
 and
 so
 the
 ones


where
 the
 CEO
 leads
 by
 the
 way
 you
 see


people
 telling
 more
 stories
 throughout


the


organization
 because
 they're
 modeling


that
 sort
 of
 behavior
 we
 were
 once
 in
 a


session
 years
 ago
 at
 a
 large
 software


company
 and
 we're
 talking
 about


storytelling
 about
 clear
 computer


communication


translation
 conversational
 language
 and


a
 younger
 executive
 kind
 of
 raised
 her


hand
 and
 said
 I
 completely
 agree
 with


all
 of
 this
 there
 are
 many
 times
 when


I'm
 in
 a
 session
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 what's


being
 said
 but
 if
 I
 don't
 use
 the


language
 that
 the
 SVP
 is
 using
 in
 this


organization
 the
 optimize
 the
 monetize


got
 to
 help
 us
 to


recontextualize
 what
 happens
 is
 they


don't
 think
 I
 understand
 it
 that
 I'm
 not


part
 of
 the
 the
 tribe
 part
 of
 the
 group


that
 that's
 a
 culture
 issue
 but
 there
 is


an
 element
 truth
 in
 that
 isn't
 it
 there


is
 to
 me
 that's
 more
 of
 a
 culture
 issue


than
 a
 communication
 issue
 but
 they're


very
 closely
 linked
 do
 you
 need
 to
 be


high
 up
 in
 the
 organization
 to
 start


using
 a
 more
 nor
 normal
 language
 I
 don't


think
 you
 need
 to
 be
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 as


important
 as
 anything
 else
 it
 takes
 a


level
 of
 confidence
 right
 it
 does
 it


does
 it
 takes
 a
 it
 takes
 a
 degree
 of


work
 to
 translate
 and
 it
 takes
 a
 degree


of
 confidence
 to
 stand
 and
 know
 that


simple
 will
 win
 out
 each
 time
 and
 so
 I'm


not
 calling
 always
 for
 the
 elimination


that
 would
 be
 terrific
 but
 I
 don't


really
 see
 that
 happening
 we've
 been


kicking
 at
 this
 can
 for
 several
 decades


at
 the
 very
 least
 perhaps
 a
 translation


that's
 why
 we
 talk
 about
 things
 like
 the


magic
 words
 so
 we
 talk
 about
 it
 in
 terms


of
 recontextualizing
 and
 what
 that


really
 means
 is
 Boom
 differentiate
 or
 we


talk
 about
 it
 in
 terms
 of
 optimizing
 let


me
 give
 an
 example
 of
 what
 that
 actually


looks
 like
 to
 optimize
 with
 one
 of
 our


products
 what
 makes
 us
 different
 these


different
 phrases
 are
 ways
 of
 maybe


having
 it
 both
 ways


how
 do
 you
 train
 people
 in
 this
 to


communicate
 more
 effectively
 more
 in
 a


story
 based
 narrative
 yeah
 you
 first
 you


work
 on
 the
 narrative
 so
 I
 would


say
 a
 couple
 things
 come
 to
 mind
 the


first
 is
 we
 talk
 about
 adopting
 a


journalist's
 mindset
 so
 all
 of
 our


coaches
 have
 some
 degree
 of
 Journalism


background
 either
 went
 to
 school
 for
 it


or
 actually
 were
 journalists
 out
 in
 the


real
 world
 for
 a
 while
 but
 I
 really


think
 that
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 craft


of
 Journalism
 it
 can
 be
 very
 valuable


here
 on
 Hunting
 to
 find
 the
 good


elements
 of
 a
 story
 and
 then
 crafting
 a


story
 in
 the
 right
 order
 in
 the
 right


flow
 so
 you
 think
 about
 the
 two
 jobs
 a


journalist
 has
 every
 day
 the
 first
 one


is
 they
 got
 to
 go
 do
 the
 reporting
 I


have
 to
 go
 do


the
 research
 I
 have
 to
 interview
 people


I
 have
 to
 ask
 great
 questions
 I'm


looking
 for
 the
 meaning
 the


summarization
 I'm
 looking
 for
 the


stories
 I'm
 looking
 for
 the
 data
 and
 the


translation
 those
 are
 the
 elements
 that


make
 up
 a
 great
 story
 the
 second
 job
 a


journalist
 has
 to
 do
 is
 once
 they've


compiled
 all
 of
 this
 and
 they
 have
 more


options
 they've
 got
 to
 put
 it
 in
 the


right
 order
 so
 from
 the
 most
 important


thing
 to
 the
 reader
 listener
 viewer


audience
 down
 so
 that's
 the
 first
 thing


is
 really
 thinking
 through
 and
 teaching


almost
 like
 a
 journalism
 101
 course
 the


second
 thing
 is
 engage
 the
 video
 camera


close
 the
 PowerPoint
 as
 a
 starting
 point


alone
 think
 about
 starting
 out
 loud


record
 it
 play
 it
 back
 and
 Now
 consume


it
 as
 if
 you
 were
 in
 in
 the
 15th
 row
 or


the
 other
 side
 of
 the
 conference
 room


table
 like
 your
 audience
 will
 in
 2
 weeks


30
 days
 60
 days
 so
 the
 value
 of
 the


video
 camera
 is
 that
 it's
 going
 to


capture
 everything
 what
 you
 said
 how
 you


said
 it
 what
 you
 look
 like
 when
 you
 say


it
 but
 you
 have
 to
 as
 a
 communicator


start
 to
 consume
 your
 presentation
 in


the
 same
 way
 that
 your
 audience
 will
 on


game
 day
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 just
 sit


there
 and
 read
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 send


them
 a
 script
 and
 read
 it
 to
 them


they're
 not
 going
 to
 sit
 there
 and
 read


it
 themselves
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 click


through
 your
 slides
 themselves
 they're


going
 to
 watch
 and
 listen
 to
 you
 so


start
 to
 grab
 it
 and
 and
 review
 it
 in


the
 way
 that
 they
 will
 that'll
 help
 you


answer
 the
 questions
 does
 this
 matter
 to


them
 do
 they
 care
 about
 it
 do
 they


understand
 it
 is
 it
 compelling
 to
 them


well
 you
 use
 your
 hands
 much
 more
 than
 I


do
 so
 you
 used
 them
 already
 a
 lot
 I
 I
 us


right
 tell
 me
 a
 it
 do
 what
 does
 it
 do


yeah
 well
 the
 first
 thing
 you
 need
 to
 do


is
 think
 about
 what
 your
 narrative
 is


what
 you're
 saying
 that's
 the
 first
 step


to
 any


presentation
 once
 you
 get
 that
 ironed


out
 you
 feel
 good
 about
 where
 you
 are


you
 got
 a
 little
 confidence
 in
 what


you're
 going
 to
 say
 and
 the
 way
 you're


going
 to
 say
 it
 now
 you
 get
 into
 the


delivery
 Parts
 which
 is
 vocally
 how
 are


you
 saying
 it
 and
 Visually
 what
 do
 you


look
 like
 when
 you
 say
 it
 and
 when
 it


comes
 to
 gestures
 I
 get
 asked
 all
 the


time
 are
 gestures
 good
 or
 are
 they
 bad


they're
 neither
 necessarily
 with
 any


sort
 of
 delivery
 thing
 it's
 about


finding
 a
 balance
 some
 where
 in
 between


now
 what
 I
 can
 be
 accused
 of
 doing
 too


much
 is
 being
 too
 animated
 too
 much


hands
 and
 it
 can
 get
 distracting
 that's


a
 point
 at
 which
 I
 got
 to
 come
 back
 to
 a


home
 base
 maybe
 maybe
 something
 like


this
 down
 below
 something
 comfortable
 to


bring
 some
 Stillness
 and
 some
 calm
 but


having
 no
 gestures
 alone
 is
 not
 very


conversational
 what
 I
 found
 from
 some


research
 years
 ago
 was
 that
 when
 we're


using
 gestures
 we're
 actually
 going


through
 the
 filing
 cabinets
 of


information
 in
 our
 brain
 saying
 where


was
 that
 piece
 of
 INF
 oh
 there
 it
 is


right
 there
 so
 there's
 a
 connection
 to


what
 we're
 saying
 what
 you
 want
 from
 any


of
 these
 three
 things
 verbal
 vocal
 and


visual
 is
 for
 all
 the
 messages
 that
 are


being
 sent
 to
 be
 the


same
 because
 the
 point
 at
 which
 they're


different
 now
 you've
 got
 an
 issue
 now


the
 audience
 is
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


what's
 your
 meaning
 what's
 your
 intent


and
 if
 we
 spend
 a
 bit
 more
 time
 on
 what


is
 that
 makes
 language
 interesting
 uh


why
 why
 do
 stories
 stick
 because
 as


human
 beings
 we
 are
 hardwired
 to
 tell


stories
 with
 Vivid
 concrete
 details


probably
 more
 importantly
 our
 audiences


are
 hardwired
 to
 consume
 process
 and


recall
 them
 so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 a
 couple


of
 pieces
 of
 information
 Susan
 win
 chank


is
 a
 behavioral
 psychologist
 she
 wrote


the
 book
 100
 things
 that
 every
 presenter


needs
 to
 know
 about
 people
 number
 six
 on


her
 list
 was
 people
 process
 information


best
 in
 story
 form
 made
 to
 stick
 is
 a


book
 that
 we
 love
 we've
 worked
 with
 the


authors
 chip
 and
 Dan
 Heath
 years
 ago
 we


learned
 a
 lot
 from
 them
 they're
 great


partners
 and
 what
 they
 clearly


illustrate
 through
 their
 book
 from
 cover


to
 cover
 is
 that
 stories
 are
 the
 most


memorable
 form
 of
 Storytelling
 so
 our


objective
 as
 narrators
 as
 presenters
 is


to
 be
 meaningful
 in
 the
 moment
 and
 more


memorable
 afterwards
 so
 if
 at
 your
 next


presentation
 you
 want
 to
 give
 yourself


the
 best
 chance
 of
 success
 for
 grabbing


and
 hooking
 your
 audience
 and
 saying


something
 that
 is
 memorable
 and


recallable
 later
 on
 take
 the
 most


important
 thing
 you're
 trying
 to
 get


across
 in
 that
 presentation
 and
 wrap
 a


story
 around
 it
 that
 says
 that
 thing
 and


that
 way
 you're
 delivering
 a
 message
 but


in
 a
 way
 that's
 much
 more
 human
 and
 how


do
 you
 make
 a
 story
 interesting
 and


memorable
 what
 are
 the
 features
 that
 we


need
 to
 have
 in
 there
 conrete
 Vivid


details
 that's
 the
 case
 whether
 you
 are


using
 a
 customer
 example
 whether
 you're


using
 an
 imagine
 scenario
 a
 backstory
 An


Origin
 story
 an
 analogy
 or
 a
 metaphor


it's
 a
 about
 having
 the
 right
 balance
 of


concrete
 Vivid
 details
 and
 the
 best


place
 to
 start
 is
 back
 in
 The
 Newsroom


so
 back
 to
 journalism
 101
 what
 does
 that


actually
 look
 like
 so
 let's
 imagine


you're
 going
 to
 give
 me
 your
 best


example
 of
 what
 you
 do
 at
 your


organization
 Nikolai
 and
 to
 illustrate


that
 you're
 gonna
 say
 let
 me
 just
 give


you
 one
 example
 of
 what
 that
 looks
 like


and
 you're
 going
 to
 tell
 me
 a
 story


about
 one
 of
 the
 companies
 that
 you
 work


with
 invest
 in
 whatever
 the
 case
 might


be
 I
 want
 to
 start
 in
 the
 preparation


process
 at
 the
 very
 least
 with
 the
 five


ws
 of
 Journalism
 use
 those
 to
 build
 the


scaffolding
 of
 the
 story
 who
 was
 it
 when


was
 it
 where
 was
 it
 why
 did
 it
 matter
 to


their
 business
 or
 your
 business
 what


actually
 happened
 what
 were
 the
 results


of
 them
 when
 you
 start
 populating
 in
 the


preparation
 with
 those
 concrete
 details


you're
 actually
 on
 a
 path
 to
 getting


something
 that
 I
 can
 put
 in
 my
 head
 and


I
 can
 process
 then
 you
 can
 start
 looking


for
 what
 are
 the
 stories
 inside
 the


story
 what's
 the
 meaning
 of
 that
 what


that's
 a
 key
 point
 there
 was
 actually
 a


a
 funny
 moment
 in
 a
 movie
 Planes
 Trains


and
 Automobiles
 years
 ago
 where
 Steve


Martin
 was
 yelling
 at
 John
 Candy
 and
 he


said
 you're
 constantly
 telling
 these


stories
 but
 they
 have
 no
 details
 in
 them


you
 know
 here's
 an
 idea
 when
 you
 tell
 a


story
 have
 a
 point
 it
 makes
 it
 so
 much


more
 interesting
 for
 The
 Listener
 you


know
 and
 it's
 funny
 but
 it's
 true
 what's


the
 point
 of
 the
 story
 how
 does
 it


illustrate
 and
 why
 does
 it
 matter
 to
 me


and
 what
 are
 the
 elements
 that
 I
 would


need
 to
 know
 about
 to
 engage
 a
 little


bit
 further
 how
 much
 do
 you
 paint
 out


the
 story
 just
 how
 much
 do
 you
 drag
 it


out
 oh
 that's
 a
 great
 question


I'm
 not
 sure
 if
 there's
 any
 one
 number


I've
 seen
 some
 great
 stories
 that
 are


really
 short
 and
 tight
 you
 know
 30


seconds
 or
 less
 I've
 also
 seen
 some
 that


might
 stretch
 to
 two
 minutes
 you
 got
 to


know
 what
 you're
 asking
 of
 your
 audience


and
 you've
 got
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 that


story
 doesn't
 drag
 on
 that's
 why
 it's


good
 to
 have
 not
 just
 a
 coach


potentially
 but
 to
 practice
 in
 front
 of


other
 people
 that
 story
 it's
 dragging
 on


way
 too
 long
 or
 it's
 really
 missing
 the


point
 but
 I
 would
 say
 anywhere
 from
 you


know
 an
 actual
 dive
 into
 an
 individual


story
 if
 you're
 looking
 30
 seconds
 to


two
 minutes
 you're
 probably
 in
 the
 right


ballpark
 is
 there
 a
 a
 danger
 that
 we
 are


dumbing
 down
 things
 uh
 I
 mean
 you
 you


were
 talking
 about
 dumbing
 down
 in
 your


book
 how
 should
 we
 look
 at
 this


yeah
 I'm
 not
 big
 enough
 to
 categorize


many
 things
 as
 fighting
 words
 but
 that


about
 does
 it
 for
 me
 dumbing
 it
 down


it's
 I
 find
 it
 to
 be
 really
 frustrating


phrase
 because
 first
 and
 foremost
 it


belittles
 the
 hard
 work
 that
 it
 takes
 to


make
 something
 clear
 that
 is
 actually


complex
 to
 do
 or
 to
 understand
 it
 takes


a
 ton
 of
 work
 and
 so
 to
 me
 the
 dumbing


down
 is
 leading
 provider
 Mission


critical
 seamless
 the
 stuff
 that
 you


could
 just
 show
 up
 and
 throw
 up
 right


now
 it's
 it's
 a
 lazier
 form
 of


communication
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 that


there's
 a
 ton
 of
 meaning
 in
 it
 I
 think


that
 one
 person
 I
 Look
 to
 for
 all
 of


this
 is
 a
 particular
 hero
 of
 mine
 from


the
 communication
 standpoint
 is
 Richard


fan
 the
 great
 physicist
 who
 won
 the
 1965


Nobel
 Prize
 in
 Quantum
 electrodynamics


he
 was
 a
 professor
 at
 Caltech
 he's
 the


inventor
 of
 nanotechnology
 in
 Quantum


Computing
 he
 was
 a
 tremendous


Storyteller
 use
 of
 imagine
 he
 was


probably
 the
 master
 of
 analogies
 to


First
 understand
 something
 new
 and
 then


to
 communicate
 it
 to
 others
 he
 used


those
 techniques
 to
 make
 his
 ideas
 and


his
 expertise
 and
 his
 knowledge
 more


accessible
 to
 more
 people
 no
 one
 ever


accused
 of
 dumbing
 things
 down
 and
 his


nickname
 interestingly
 enough
 was
 the


great
 explainer
 not
 the
 great
 scientist


or
 physicist
 or
 mind
 or
 inventor
 the


great
 explainer
 because
 we
 revered
 him


for
 his
 ability
 to
 make
 complex
 things


Crystal
 Clear
 it's
 so
 interesting


because
 supposedly
 PhD
 dissertations
 are


just
 becoming
 more
 and
 more
 complicated


less
 and
 less
 uh
 possible
 to
 understand


and
 yet
 somebody
 like
 that
 is
 doing
 the


exact
 opposite
 I
 think
 we
 all
 fall
 into


this
 I
 think
 chip
 and
 Dan
 Heath
 have
 the


best
 line
 in
 history
 when
 they
 called
 it


the
 curse
 of
 knowledge
 we
 know
 so
 much


about
 what
 we
 know
 about
 our
 area
 of


expertise
 our
 subject
 our
 product
 our


business
 that
 we
 almost
 forget
 what
 it's


like
 to
 not
 have
 that
 same
 level
 of


Interest
 or
 expertise
 in
 that
 topic
 and


that
 Gap
 can
 make
 us
 bad
 communicators


you
 were
 talking
 about
 science
 and


dissertations
 and
 things
 there's


actually
 an
 interesting
 study
 done
 in


2020
 by
 two
 researchers
 at
 the
 national


research
 Institute
 in
 palanza
 Italy
 and


they
 were
 trying
 to
 quantify
 put
 some


numbers
 to
 this
 soft
 skill
 of


communication
 and
 so
 they
 looked
 at
 100


no


21,000
 uh
 scientific
 manuscripts
 in
 cave


science
 over
 a
 30-year
 period
 and
 they


were
 trying
 to
 determine
 the
 correlation


between
 the
 amount
 of
 jargon
 used
 in
 a


manuscript
 title
 abstract
 or
 full


document
 with
 the
 number
 of
 citations


that
 it
 received
 from
 peers
 and
 others


in
 the
 scientific
 Community
 the


manuscript
 is
 a
 communication
 to
 tool


the
 citation
 of
 course
 is
 the
 way
 that


you
 drum
 up
 awareness
 and
 funding
 The


Tipping
 Point
 for
 the
 amount
 of
 jargon


and
 the
 success
 of
 that
 document
 with


citations
 was
 1%
 so
 those
 documents
 that


in
 their
 title
 abstract
 or
 full


manuscript
 used
 more
 than
 1%
 of
 jargon


the
 citations
 dropped
 precipitously
 and


the
 highest
 ranked
 highest
 cited
 Works


used
 less
 than
 1%
 of
 jargon
 in
 the


entire
 document
 if
 any
 jargon
 at
 all
 so


the
 jargon
 stood
 between
 a
 potentially


great
 idea
 and
 its
 audience
 that's
 scary


that's
 very
 scary
 Andy
 why
 do
 you
 hate


power


points
 that's
 very
 direct
 I
 think
 we


were
 probably
 that
 Direct
 in
 our
 book
 I


don't
 hate
 PowerPoint
 I
 think
 our


audiences
 sometimes
 hate
 the
 way
 we
 use


it
 it
 does
 serve
 as
 a
 crutch
 far
 too


often
 it
 stands
 in
 the
 way
 people
 might


read
 what's
 on
 the
 screen
 here's
 a


couple
 of
 Statistics
 from
 2003
 Microsoft


said
 that
 30
 million
 PowerPoint


presentations
 were
 delivered
 or
 every


single
 day
 that's
 terrifying
 now
 I
 don't


know
 what
 the
 stat
 is
 in
 2025
 but
 I
 can


guarantee
 it's
 not
 any
 less
 than
 that


the
 average
 slide
 has
 40
 words
 on


it
 we
 can
 read
 three
 times
 faster
 than


we
 can
 speak
 so
 if
 you
 put
 40
 words
 up


on
 a
 slide
 I'm
 on
 the
 40th
 word
 reading


it
 while
 you're
 on
 the
 13th
 word
 talking


it
 through
 now
 the
 soundt
 track
 is
 off


and
 I'm
 not
 just
 going
 to
 wait
 for
 you


to
 catch
 up
 to
 me
 each
 time
 so
 there's


just
 a
 number
 of
 complications
 for
 poor


PowerPoint
 hygiene
 I
 think
 the
 main


thing
 that
 you
 could
 do
 is
 not
 to


eliminate
 PowerPoint
 or
 not
 to
 say
 I


hate
 it
 and
 I
 should
 never
 use
 it
 it's


to
 think
 about
 the
 process
 so
 the


starting
 point
 is
 when
 we
 should


eliminate
 PowerPoint
 start
 out
 loud


start
 on
 camera
 start
 with
 your


knowledge
 talking
 it
 out
 the
 challenge


becomes
 when
 people
 start
 in
 PowerPoint


and
 they
 put
 all
 that
 information
 and


graphs
 and
 diagrams
 and
 words
 and
 bullet


points
 on
 47
 slides
 and
 then
 they
 come


back
 to
 the
 first
 one
 and
 say
 now
 what


am
 I
 going
 to
 say
 to
 this
 slide
 you're


in
 The
 Hurt
 Locker
 at
 that
 point
 the


PowerPoint
 is
 dictating
 The
 Narrative


you're
 talking
 to
 it
 it's
 dragging
 you


along
 it's
 got
 you
 in
 control
 that's
 the


opposite
 of
 what
 we
 want
 to
 have
 on
 game


day
 so
 if
 you
 want
 to
 inject
 PowerPoint


or
 visuals
 into
 your
 presentation
 and


that
 can
 be
 very
 helpful
 there
 are


visual
 Learners
 visual
 thinkers
 if
 it


supports
 your
 narrative
 great
 the
 things


that
 support
 a
 verbal
 narrative
 are


things
 like
 a
 picture
 a
 number
 maybe


five
 words
 or
 less
 how
 many
 slides


should
 a
 PowerPoint
 presentation
 have


great


question
 I
 think
 the
 challenge
 comes


into
 how
 many
 overall
 slides
 versus
 how


much
 information
 on
 each
 slide
 I
 would


much
 rather
 have
 a


20
 slide
 presentation
 with
 one
 thought


per
 slide
 one
 idea
 per
 slide
 slide


versus
 six
 slides
 with
 20
 slides
 of


information
 jammed
 into
 it
 so
 for
 me


it's
 less
 about
 the
 total
 number


although
 that
 is
 has
 to
 enter
 into
 the


equation
 and
 it's
 more
 about
 how
 much
 is


on
 each
 slide
 or
 each
 visual
 but
 this


you
 notice
 we're
 we're
 already
 right
 now


we're
 trapped
 in
 this
 concept
 of
 slides


are
 the
 only
 presentation
 visual
 that


could
 be
 there
 plenty
 of
 other
 things


first
 and
 foremost
 you
 are
 the
 visual
 so


it's
 got
 to
 start
 with
 you
 and
 what
 you


look
 like
 when
 you're
 saying
 it
 but
 then


there
 are
 are
 physical
 props
 there
 are


whiteboards
 there
 are
 flip
 charts


there's
 many
 other
 things
 that
 you
 can


use
 to
 visually
 uh
 Aid
 a
 strong
 verbal


narrative
 why
 is
 the
 font
 size
 so


important
 very
 simply
 because
 the
 larger


the
 font
 size
 the
 less
 stuff
 you
 can
 put


on
 a
 slide
 but
 I
 also
 saw
 uh
 uh
 the


larger
 the
 font
 size
 the
 more
 credible


you
 become
 the
 more
 people
 actually


believe
 in
 your
 message
 and
 believe
 and


believe
 it's
 more
 truthful
 I
 thought
 I


think
 that's
 so
 interesting


that
 is
 fascinating
 there
 are
 all
 these


little
 pieces
 of
 of
 brain
 science
 and


brain
 behavior
 that
 that
 pop
 up
 I
 think


that's
 the
 coolest
 thing
 about
 being
 a


presentation
 coach
 today
 is
 that
 the


science
 is
 finally
 catching
 up
 to
 the


art
 of
 communication
 we're
 learning
 a


whole
 lot
 more
 about
 how
 our
 audiences


consume
 process
 and
 recall
 information


just
 by
 human
 cognitive
 behavior
 and
 so


we
 should
 take
 as
 much
 of
 that
 that
 is


fully
 sourced
 and
 referenced
 and


consider
 it
 as
 we're
 preparing
 and


delivering
 presentations
 and
 you
 suggest


we
 have
 like
 a
 detox
 away
 from


PowerPoint
 like
 30
 days
 without


PowerPoints
 how
 how
 do
 you
 think
 that


how
 does
 it
 work
 I'm
 a
 big
 fan
 of
 any


forcing
 function
 that
 helps
 us


ultimately
 get
 better
 at
 communication


hiring
 a
 a
 coach
 is
 like
 hiring
 a


personal
 trainer
 for
 Fitness
 you
 should


see
 them
 often
 you
 should
 always
 have
 a


workout
 you
 should
 get
 playback
 and


coaching
 and
 critique
 and
 do
 another
 rep


it's
 about
 getting
 the
 rep
 in
 the
 gym


getting
 to
 a
 point
 where
 we're
 at
 our


very
 best
 self
 as
 a
 presenter
 sometimes


takes
 us
 to
 strip
 it
 back
 to
 a
 pretty


raw
 workout
 so
 it
 can
 be
 things
 like
 get


rid
 of
 the
 PowerPoint
 prepare
 in
 a


different
 way
 when
 you
 present
 don't
 use


PowerPoint
 see
 what
 that
 does
 to
 your


presenter
 I
 bet
 you
 it
 will
 make
 people


practice
 more
 prepare
 harder
 and
 they


will
 be
 better
 more
 conversational
 at


that
 presentation
 they'll
 probably
 also


be
 a
 lot
 more
 concise
 that's
 the
 first


thing
 the
 other
 kind
 of
 detox
 is
 is
 back


to
 jargon
 my
 son
 went
 to
 a
 school
 uh
 an


elementary
 school
 for
 dyslexic
 children


and
 in
 third
 grade
 they
 got
 to
 the
 stage


where
 they
 had
 already
 decoded
 language


started
 to
 recode
 it
 they're
 reading


more
 fluently
 making
 a
 lot
 of
 progress


there
 now
 we
 had
 to
 become
 writers
 so
 in


his
 composition
 class
 learning
 to


construct
 sentences
 use
 language


punctuation
 grammar
 Lisa
 lville
 was
 the


teacher
 there
 and
 I
 walked
 into
 that


third
 grade
 class
 class
 Once
 Upon
 a
 Time


and
 noticed
 on
 her
 whiteboard
 a
 list
 of


words
 and
 the
 title
 of
 the
 list
 of
 words


was
 words
 we
 shall
 not
 use
 and
 for
 a


bunch
 of
 third
 grade
 dyslexic
 children


it
 was
 cool
 and
 good
 and
 neat
 and


different
 words
 like
 that
 because
 they


were
 easy
 they
 were
 lazy
 they
 could
 go


right
 to
 them
 and
 they
 were
 used
 far
 too


often
 and
 we
 almost
 removed
 the
 meaning


from
 those
 words
 so
 these
 are
 words


we're
 not
 going
 to
 use
 in
 our
 sentences


anymore
 there's
 a
 bigger
 broader


language
 let's
 let's
 learn
 some
 greater


Vo
 vocabulary
 that
 can
 be
 more
 precise


and
 more
 descriptive
 I've
 actually


worked
 with
 sales
 teams
 in
 the
 past


where
 we
 created
 the
 list
 of
 words
 we


shall
 not
 use
 in
 sales
 calls
 because


it's
 too
 easy
 it's
 too
 common
 it's
 too


much
 like
 everybody
 else
 and
 we
 were


exploring
 different
 words
 that
 could
 be


more
 descriptive
 and
 more
 illustrative


of
 what
 they
 do
 what's
 the
 best
 uh


presentation
 you
 ever
 seen
 I
 can't
 limit


it
 down
 to
 just


one
 I
 me
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 that
 I
 think


Julie
 swe
 at
 centure
 is
 one
 of
 if
 not


the
 best
 business
 communicators
 going


right
 now
 she
 has
 got
 such
 command
 and


Poise
 she
 tells
 stories
 she
 sign
 posts


often
 uh
 for
 example
 she
 might
 say
 so


over
 the
 next
 10
 minutes
 I'm
 going
 to


talk
 about
 two
 things
 and
 so
 the


audience
 will
 always
 know
 where
 they
 are


in
 that
 conversation
 or
 presentation
 one


of
 the
 ones
 that
 I
 like
 to
 site
 though


is
 probably
 somebody
 you've
 never
 heard


of
 and
 maybe
 a
 company
 you've
 never


heard
 of
 It's
 a
 small
 distributor
 of


indirect


materials
 it's
 a
 company
 called
 MSA


Industrial
 Supply
 and
 Eric
 gerswin
 was


the
 CEO
 when
 I
 started
 working
 with
 him


he
 still
 is
 a
 CEO
 today
 and
 he
 was
 given


the
 keynote
 address
 or
 a
 keynote
 address


at
 arba
 live
 in
 2015
 and
 he
 had
 never


given
 an
 external
 presentation
 before


never
 been
 on
 a
 stage
 the
 only
 thing
 he


had
 done
 to
 present
 and
 it
 is
 a


different
 form
 of
 pres
 presentation
 a


sales
 pitch
 a
 customer
 meeting
 maybe
 a


town
 hall
 at
 work
 but
 never
 on
 a
 stage


in
 front
 of
 the
 big
 lights
 in
 front
 of


3,000


Chief
 procurement
 officers
 and
 so
 the


amount
 of
 work
 that
 Eric
 gerswin
 put


into
 his
 narrative
 was
 60
 to
 90
 days
 of


incredible
 narrative
 preparation
 trying


to
 find
 what's
 my
 lead
 what's
 my


summarization
 what's
 my
 story
 that
 I
 can


use
 to
 illustrate
 it
 what
 are
 the


different
 chapters
 of
 the
 body
 of
 the


talk
 so
 that
 the
 audience
 will
 always


know
 where
 they
 are
 and
 I
 can
 illustrate


different
 ways
 of
 making
 this
 progress


happen
 and
 I
 tuck
 in
 each
 of
 those


chapters
 maybe
 an
 example
 of
 a
 customer


who's
 doing
 this
 well
 an
 anecdote
 of


time
 where
 something
 a
 revelation
 I
 had


it
 was
 a
 tremendous
 talk
 and
 he
 walked


off
 stage
 after
 this
 first
 presentation


and
 the
 first
 person
 backstage
 said
 to


him
 man
 that
 was
 a
 TED
 Talk
 for


procurement
 so
 with
 his
 chest
 bowed
 up


and
 you
 know
 his
 shoulders
 uh
 back
 he


walked
 to
 the
 arba
 trade
 show
 floor


stood
 at
 the
 MSC
 booth
 and
 one
 Chief


procurement
 officer
 after
 another
 from


the
 audience
 walked
 up
 to
 him
 and
 said


yep
 you
 got
 to
 help
 me
 clean
 up
 the


attic
 that
 was
 directly
 from
 his


featured
 story
 to
 illustrate
 his
 main


point
 about
 the
 difference
 between
 the


garage
 and
 the


attic
 it's
 a
 tremendous
 example
 of


somebody
 owning
 the
 moment
 and
 all
 of


the
 work
 that
 it
 takes
 to
 get
 to
 that


moment
 where
 they
 look
 like
 on
 stage


that
 they're
 just
 making
 it
 happen
 it's


just
 at
 ease
 it's
 effortless
 they're


almost
 looking
 like
 they're
 just
 winging


it
 but
 there's
 so
 much
 preparation
 that


goes
 into
 that
 and
 the
 coolest
 part
 is


the
 last
 thing
 I'll
 say
 the
 coolest
 part


was
 months
 later
 it
 was
 some
 random
 day


to
 me
 and
 I
 get
 an
 email
 from
 the
 head


of
 marketing
 at
 MSC
 Industrial
 Supply


and
 attached
 to
 it
 is
 a
 video
 and
 inside


the
 video
 when
 I
 open
 it
 up
 it's


nine-year-old
 Jake
 Gershwin
 Eric's
 one


of
 his
 sons
 and
 it's
 bringing
 your
 kids


to
 workday
 at
 MSC
 and
 somebody
 put
 a


camera
 in
 Jake's
 face
 and
 they
 said
 go


and
 he
 said
 this
 you
 can't
 fix
 what
 you


can't
 see
 did
 you
 know
 that
 today


there's
 $145
 billion
 dollar
 of
 indirect


materials
 inside
 of
 your
 companies
 and


100
 and
 70%
 will
 never
 be
 used
 that's


100
 bill
 ion
 Dollar
 in
 waste
 and
 he's


giving
 his
 dad's
 presentation
 darn
 near


word
 for
 word
 out
 loud
 he
 knows
 it
 verba


him
 because
 he
 heard
 his
 dad
 practicing


it
 for
 weeks
 upon
 weeks
 out
 loud
 at
 home


behind
 the
 scenes
 that's
 what
 it
 takes


so
 Andy
 if
 that's
 where
 we
 want
 to
 get


to
 um
 what
 advice
 would
 you
 have
 for


young
 people
 or
 students
 who
 want
 to


become
 the
 best
 communicators
 in
 the


world
 tap
 into
 your
 inner
 journalist


that
 journalism
 mindset
 is
 really


important
 because
 it's
 a
 starting
 point


Point
 what
 is
 my
 topic
 okay
 what's
 the


point
 why
 would
 my
 audience
 care
 about


it
 something
 we
 call
 the
 so
 what
 who


cares
 test
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 to
 them
 why


would
 they
 care
 if
 I
 had
 to
 say
 it
 in


one
 sentence
 what
 would
 it
 be
 in
 a


nutshell
 here's
 the
 point
 go
 hunt
 for


their
 story
 that
 illustrates
 that
 point


from
 with
 inside
 the
 business
 that
 says


why
 it
 matters
 why
 we
 should
 do
 more
 of


it
 what
 it
 looks
 like
 when
 it's
 good


think
 about
 the
 different
 things
 that


you're
 going
 to
 ask
 of
 your
 audience
 or


recommend
 that
 they
 do
 on
 those


signposted
 sections
 what
 are
 the
 two


things
 that
 we
 need
 to
 do
 to
 make
 this


happen
 there
 are
 three
 benefits
 of
 this


or
 two
 outcomes
 that
 we
 can
 guarantee
 so


think
 about
 it
 from
 the
 most
 important


information
 down
 to
 the
 least
 important


information
 what
 I
 just
 drew
 there
 was


the
 thing
 that
 the
 journalist
 uses
 every


day
 called
 the
 inverted
 pyramid
 it's
 a


way
 of
 organizing
 all
 of
 your


information
 from
 your
 audience
 or
 your


customer
 or
 your
 reader
 down
 so
 it's


most
 important
 to
 least


important
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I


would
 think
 about
 the
 second
 thing
 is


that's
 the
 preparation
 do
 more


practicing
 out
 loud
 this
 is
 about


internalizing
 not
 memorizing
 and
 the
 way


to
 do
 that
 is
 get
 some
 reps
 going
 stand


up
 and
 present
 it
 to
 a
 video
 camera
 if


you
 don't
 have
 that
 to
 a
 mirror
 into


your
 memo
 app
 on
 your
 phone
 listen
 to
 it


back
 when
 you're
 driving
 the
 car
 to
 work


and
 back
 walking
 the
 dog
 you've
 got
 time


to
 practice
 this
 so
 you're
 just
 kind
 of


baking
 it
 in
 well
 Andy
 you
 have
 painted


this
 is
 uh
 out
 very
 loud
 and
 clearly
 uh


a
 big
 thank
 you
 for
 uh
 for
 helping
 us


and
 um
 look
 forward
 to
 staying
 in
 touch


and
 big
 thanks
 for
 taking
 the
 time
 today


thanks
 so
 much
 Nikolai
 thanks
