From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Natalie


Kitroof.
 This
 is
 the
 daily.


The
 White
 House
 borders
 our
 Tom
 Hman
 was


recorded
 on
 an
 FBI
 surveillance
 tape
 in


September
 2024
 accepting
 $50,000
 in


cash.
 Did
 he
 keep
 that
 money
 or
 give
 it


back?
 For
 the
 past
 few
 weeks,
 Trump


officials
 have
 been
 asked
 repeatedly


about
 an
 undercover
 FBI
 investigation
 of


Bordersar
 Tom
 H.
 Home. Homeman,


>> what
 became
 of
 the
 $50,000
 in
 cash
 that


the
 FBI
 delivered
 to
 Mr.
 Homeman?


>> And
 consistently,
 they've
 sidestepped,


>> did
 he
 accept
 that
 $50,000
 or
 not,


>> George,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 you're
 talking


about.
 Did
 he
 accept
 $50,000
 for
 what?


>> Or
 refuse
 to
 answer
 key
 questions.


>> Did
 the
 FBI
 get
 it
 back?
 Senator
 White


House,
 you're
 welcome
 to
 talk
 to
 the
 FBI


>> about
 whether
 one
 of
 Trump's
 top


immigration
 officials
 brazenly
 broke
 the


law
 and
 what's
 being
 done
 about
 it.
 The


White
 House
 and
 the
 president
 stand
 by


Tom
 H.
 Homeman
 100%
 because
 he
 did


absolutely
 nothing
 wrong
 and
 he
 is
 a


>> Today,
 my
 colleague
 Devlin
 Barrett
 on


the
 story
 behind
 those
 questions
 and
 why


the
 Tom
 Hman
 scandal
 hasn't
 faded
 away.


It's
 Wednesday,
 October
 15th.


Develin,
 I've
 been
 watching
 this
 story


of
 these
 allegations
 surrounding
 Tom
 H.


Home. Homeman
 unfold
 over
 the
 past


several
 weeks.
 And
 as
 I've
 watched,
 I


keep
 thinking
 about
 this
 interview
 I
 did


with
 Holman
 on
 the
 show
 in
 June.
 One


thing
 that
 really
 stuck
 with
 me
 from


that
 interview
 was
 just
 how


uncompromising
 Holman
 was
 in
 the
 way
 he


presented
 his
 view
 of
 the
 law
 and
 what


should
 happen
 to
 people
 who
 break
 it,


that
 they
 should
 be
 punished.
 And
 I
 want


to
 just
 play
 you
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 tape


about
 how
 he
 represented
 himself
 and


that
 mission.


>> We're
 a
 nation
 from
 laws,
 right?
 We
 got


to
 enforce
 laws.
 Entering
 this
 country


league
 is
 a
 crime.
 We
 don't
 pick
 and


choose
 what
 we
 enforce.
 We're
 here
 to


enforce
 the
 law.
 And
 then
 recently
 we


got
 some
 new
 information
 about
 H


Homeman.
 Tell
 us
 when
 you
 first
 learned


about
 this
 story.


>> So
 I
 cover
 the
 Justice
 Department
 and


the
 FBI
 and
 months
 ago
 I
 had
 started


hearing
 rumblings
 that
 there
 had
 been


some
 kind
 of
 bribery
 investigation


related
 to
 Tom
 Hman.
 But
 I
 couldn't


quite
 figure
 out
 what
 it
 was
 about
 or


where
 it
 was.
 And
 for
 a
 while
 I
 I
 it


just
 was
 a
 puzzle
 I
 couldn't
 solve.


>> You
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 stories
 you
 were


covering.


>> It's
 pretty
 busy
 at
 the
 DOJ
 and
 the
 FBI


most
 days.
 Then
 sometime
 in
 September,
 I


got
 a
 little
 more
 information
 where


someone
 knew
 some
 of
 the
 answers
 to


these
 questions
 and
 said,
 you
 know,
 oh,


you
 mean
 the
 case
 with
 a
 bag
 of
 cash?


>> Whoa.
 Bag
 of
 cash.
 It's
 uh
 that's
 a


pretty
 big
 tip.


>> Well,
 right.
 That's
 not,
 you
 know,
 what


you
 would
 think
 of
 as
 like,
 let's
 call


it
 regular
 business
 practice,
 right?


It's
 almost
 the
 stereotypical
 way
 that


people
 think
 of
 corruption
 cases.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 from
 that
 point,
 I
 started
 putting


more
 pieces
 together
 and
 figuring
 more


things
 out.
 I
 wasn't
 the
 only
 reporter


chasing
 this.
 MSNBC
 also
 figured
 it
 out.


And
 so
 what
 I
 eventually
 came
 to


understand
 was
 that
 there
 had
 been


beginning
 really
 in
 2023,
 but
 stretching


all
 the
 way
 into
 this
 year,
 a
 really


fascinating
 investigation


that
 came
 to
 include
 Tom
 Hman.


As
 it's
 been
 described
 to
 me
 by
 sources,


if
 you
 go
 back
 to
 the
 spring
 of
 2023,


the
 FBI
 in
 Texas
 was
 conducting
 an


undercover
 investigation
 related
 to
 a


particular
 businessman.


And
 the
 investigation,
 my
 sources
 were


adamant,
 was
 not
 looking
 at
 Tom
 Hman
 at


all.
 But
 in
 the
 course
 of
 that


investigation,


that
 businessman
 told
 the
 undercover


agents
 that
 if
 those
 agents
 who
 were


posing
 as
 businessmen
 looking
 for


government
 contracts,
 if
 they
 were


willing
 to
 pay
 Tom
 Holman
 a
 million


dollars,
 he
 could
 steer
 government


contracts
 to
 them.


>> So
 these
 agents
 weren't
 initially


fishing
 for
 anything
 related
 to
 Tom


Holman.
 They
 weren't
 looking
 at
 him
 at


that
 time.


>> My
 sources
 are
 adamant
 that
 no
 one
 had


asked
 about
 Tom
 Holman.
 that
 was
 brought


up
 unprompted
 and
 Tom
 Hman
 just
 sort
 of


wanders
 into
 the
 picture,
 wanders
 into


the
 frame
 of
 what
 the
 FBI
 agents
 are


already
 doing.


>> Wow.
 Just
 to
 put
 us
 in
 time
 here,
 we're


in
 2023.
 We
 know
 Tom
 Holman
 as
 the


former
 ICE
 director
 in
 the
 first
 Trump


administration,
 this
 longtime
 border


official.
 He
 actually
 served
 in
 the


Obama
 administration,
 but
 he's
 not
 in


government
 at
 this
 point.
 Right.


>> Right.
 He's
 just
 a
 private
 citizen
 and


he
 runs
 a
 consulting
 business
 for


companies
 that
 are
 seeking
 contracts.


So,
 it's
 not
 completely
 out
 of
 the
 blue


that
 he
 would
 have
 some
 interest
 in


government
 contracts.
 But
 again,
 he's


not
 in
 government
 at
 that
 time.
 And
 he's


he's
 known
 mostly
 as
 a
 former
 Trump


official
 who
 is
 what
 they
 sometimes
 call


a
 campaign
 surrogate.
 He
 often
 would


appear,
 you
 know,
 speaking
 publicly
 in


support
 of
 another
 Trump
 administration.


And
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 general
 expectation


that
 if
 Trump
 wins
 reelection,
 Homeman


will
 rejoin
 the
 government.
 And
 in


November
 of
 2023,
 he
 out
 and
 out
 says


it.
 He
 says,
 you
 know,
 I
 promise


President
 Trump
 that
 if
 he
 goes
 back,
 I


go
 back.
 And
 then
 he
 added
 to
 that
 and


I'm
 going
 to
 run
 the
 biggest
 deportation


operation
 this
 country's
 ever
 seen.


>> Right?
 He's
 he's
 widely
 seen
 as
 a
 likely


member
 of
 a
 future
 Trump
 administration.


He's
 saying
 he's
 going
 to
 be
 there
 and


there's
 this
 sense
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 money


is
 going
 to
 be
 thrown
 at
 the
 area
 that


he's
 going
 to
 be
 involved
 in
 in
 in


border
 enforcement.


>> Well,
 right,
 that
 that
 whole
 time


period,
 the
 Trump
 campaign
 is
 talking


about
 deporting
 millions
 of
 people.
 It


is
 a
 very
 expensive
 prospect.
 So,


there's
 a
 natural
 expectation
 that
 there


will
 be
 significant
 government
 contracts


related
 to
 both
 border
 security
 work
 and


deportation
 work.
 Okay,
 so
 back
 to
 the


investigation.
 What
 happens
 next?


>> So
 once
 that
 businessman
 just
 sort
 of


proposes
 this
 notion
 that
 uh
 the


undercover
 agents
 could
 pay
 Tom
 Hman
 to


get
 government
 contracts,
 a
 series
 of


conversations
 follow.


This
 investigation
 goes
 on
 for
 a
 long


time,
 but
 eventually
 a
 meeting
 is
 set
 up


for
 September
 20th,
 2024.
 And
 at
 that


meeting,
 my
 sources
 tell
 me
 the


undercover
 agents
 bring
 $50,000
 in
 cash


and
 that
 cash
 is
 put
 in
 a
 takeout
 food


bag,
 a
 bag
 from
 the
 chain
 Cava.


So
 what
 has
 been
 described
 to
 me
 is
 at


that
 meeting,
 Homeman
 both
 accepts
 the


cash
 and
 seems
 to
 convey
 that
 he's


willing
 to
 help
 them
 get
 contracts
 in


the
 future.
 Do
 we
 know
 exactly
 what
 he


says,
 Devlin?
 Do
 we
 have
 any
 specific


information
 about
 that?


>> We
 don't
 know
 exactly
 what
 he
 says,
 and


that's
 obviously
 a
 big
 question
 in
 this


whole
 process,
 but
 we
 do
 know
 that
 the


FBI
 agents
 made
 an
 audio
 recording
 of


the
 meeting.
 So,
 somewhere
 in
 government


files,
 there
 exists,
 I
 am
 told,
 an
 audio


recording
 of
 this
 discussion.
 And
 what's


been
 described
 to
 me
 is
 that
 H
 Homeman


accepts
 the
 cash
 and
 leaves.


And
 that's
 a
 great
 start
 to
 an


investigation.
 You've
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 work


with
 there,
 right?
 Because
 the
 person


you're
 investigating
 has
 taken
 the
 money


and
 appears
 to
 have
 agreed
 to
 do
 things


in
 exchange
 for
 the
 money.


But
 that's
 not
 really
 the
 end
 of
 the


investigation.


>> Why
 not?


>> For
 a
 couple
 reasons.
 one
 because
 there


was
 no
 very
 specific
 act
 that
 he
 agreed


to
 do
 in
 exchange
 for
 that
 money
 and
 two


it's
 important
 to
 remember
 at
 the
 time


he
 takes
 the
 money
 Tom
 Hman
 is
 still
 not


a
 government
 official
 he
 certainly
 can't


make
 the
 Biden
 administration
 which
 was


running
 the
 government
 at
 that
 time


award
 contracts
 so
 in
 the
 moment
 the


cash
 is
 handed
 over
 homeman
 really
 can't


deliver
 even
 if
 he
 wants
 to


>> right
 I
 guess
 the
 assumption
 here
 is


that
 this
 is
 like
 a
 down
 payment
 for


future
 services
 that
 he
 could


potentially
 render.
 Correct.


>> Right.
 The
 investigators
 thought
 of
 it


as
 this
 is
 the
 start
 of
 the


relationship.
 This
 is
 the
 start
 of
 the


process.


>> Delin,
 does
 that
 help
 explain
 a
 question


I've
 had
 about
 all
 this,
 which
 is


$50,000
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 money,
 but
 it
 also


doesn't
 feel
 like
 enough
 for
 someone


like
 Homeman
 to
 do
 something
 this
 risky


that
 could
 really
 jeopardize
 his
 career,


>> right?
 It
 wasn't
 necessarily
 that
 you


give
 him
 this
 $50,000
 and
 then
 he


immediately
 starts
 doing
 things
 for
 you.


One
 source
 described
 it
 as,
 you
 know,


they
 paid
 money
 to
 make
 a
 friend.
 And
 in


a
 regular
 corruption
 investigation,


there
 would
 naturally
 be
 follow-up


meetings,
 maybe
 follow-up
 payments.


That's
 certainly
 a
 possibility
 in
 such
 a


in
 such
 an
 investigation,


>> right?
 They're
 playing
 the
 long
 game


here.


>> Exactly.
 They
 have
 a
 very
 strong
 start


to
 a
 case.
 They
 have
 very
 good
 evidence


and
 they
 have
 a
 very
 good
 basis
 to


proceed
 with
 their
 investigation.


And
 then
 Trump
 wins
 the
 election,


>> right?


>> And
 within
 days
 of
 Trump
 winning
 the


election,
 the
 president-elect
 announces


that
 Tom
 Hman
 will
 become
 his
 border


zar.


And
 not
 many
 people
 know
 the
 ins
 and


outs
 of
 these
 ZAR
 positions
 that


government
 and
 white
 houses
 sometimes


announce.


>> Yeah.
 I've
 always
 wondered,
 is
 that
 a


real
 long-term
 position
 in
 the
 US


government?
 bizarre.


>> It's
 not
 a
 something
 you're
 nominated


for.
 It's
 not
 something
 that
 the
 Senate


confirms
 you
 for.
 It's
 it's
 very
 much


sort
 of
 a
 point
 person
 for
 an


administration
 on
 a
 particular
 subject.


But
 what
 matters
 in
 this
 instance
 is


that
 because
 there's
 no
 Senate


confirmation,
 there's
 not
 the
 same
 kind


of
 background
 check
 scrubbing
 that
 goes


on
 for
 a
 ZAR
 position
 as
 there
 is
 for
 a


cabinet
 official
 or
 a
 deputy
 cabinet


official.
 And
 that's
 important
 in


Homeman's
 situation
 because
 there
 is


this
 underlying
 outstanding
 case.


>> Are
 you
 saying
 basically
 that
 this
 might


have
 been
 intentional
 that
 the
 Trump


administration
 might
 have
 nominated


Homeman
 to
 the
 Zsar
 position
 in
 order
 to


avoid
 a
 background
 check?


>> It's
 really
 unclear.
 But
 we
 do
 know,


however,
 that


during
 the
 transition,
 after
 Trump
 is


elected,
 but
 before
 he
 is
 sworn
 into


office,
 federal
 law
 enforcement


officials
 notify
 and
 essentially
 warn


the
 incoming
 administration


that
 this
 investigation
 exists
 into
 Tom


Hman.


>> And
 the
 Trump
 Justice
 Department
 then


does
 inherit
 this
 investigation.
 Walk
 us


through
 what
 they
 do
 with
 it.


>> The
 short
 answer
 is
 they
 don't
 do
 much


of
 anything
 with
 it.


The
 senior
 officials
 of
 that


administration
 look
 at
 the
 case
 and


they
 don't
 like
 it.


They're
 very
 skeptical
 that
 this
 is


anything
 worth
 pursuing.
 And
 this
 this


case
 that
 the
 agents
 and
 investigators


thought
 was
 was
 a
 very
 solid
 case,
 a


very
 promising
 start,
 it
 just
 gets


closed.


>> We'll
 be
 right
 back.


So
 Devlin,
 once
 this
 story
 breaks
 about


the
 investigation
 and
 about
 the
 ending


of
 the
 investigation,
 what
 happens?
 How


does
 the
 Trump
 administration
 respond?


Do
 they
 explain
 their
 decision
 to
 drop


this
 case?


>> So
 when
 we
 ask
 the
 Justice
 Department
 to


explain,
 you
 know,
 why
 was
 this
 case


closed?
 The
 FBI
 director
 Cash
 Patel
 and


the
 deputy
 attorney
 general
 Todd
 Blanch


said
 that,
 you
 know,
 it
 was
 reviewed
 by


agents
 and
 prosecutors
 and
 they
 said


those
 agents
 and
 prosecutors
 found
 no


credible
 evidence
 of
 any
 criminal


wrongdoing.
 They
 basically
 called
 it
 a


baseless
 investigation


and
 that's
 why
 they
 say
 they
 closed
 it.


>> They
 don't
 mention
 the
 bag
 of
 cash


specifically.


They
 don't
 mention
 the
 bag
 of
 cash
 and


that
 becomes
 a
 real
 focal
 point
 of
 all


the
 questions
 that
 follow
 about
 what
 the


administration
 did
 here
 and
 why
 they
 did


it.


One
 of
 the
 first
 very
 public
 comments


about
 all
 this
 is
 the
 White
 House
 press


secretary
 Carolyn
 Levit.


>> Does
 Homeman
 have
 to
 return
 the
 $50,000?


>> Well,
 Mr.
 Holman
 never
 took
 the
 $50,000


that
 you're
 referring
 to,
 so
 you
 should


get
 your
 facts
 straight.
 Number
 one,


>> denying
 that
 he
 took
 the
 money
 at
 all.


Hours
 after
 that,


>> Tom,
 I
 want
 to
 give
 you
 a
 chance
 to


address
 this
 article
 that
 came
 out
 over


the
 weekend.


>> Tom
 H.
 Homeman
 goes
 on
 Fox
 News
 and
 he's


given
 an
 opportunity
 to
 just
 respond
 to


the
 reporting,
 respond
 to
 these


allegations.
 And
 his
 answer
 is
 very


telling
 in
 one
 way
 in
 that
 he
 never


denies
 taking
 the
 money.


>> Sorry.
 Look,
 I
 did
 nothing
 criminal.
 I


did
 nothing
 illegal.
 And
 there's
 hit


piece
 after
 hit
 piece
 after
 hit
 piece.


>> He
 repeats
 very
 emphatically
 that
 he


didn't
 commit
 any
 crime.
 And
 I'm
 glad


the
 FBI
 and
 DOJ
 came
 out
 and
 said
 and


that,
 you
 know,
 said
 that
 nothing


illegal
 happened,
 nothing,
 you
 know,
 uh,


no
 criminal
 activity.
 You're
 talking


about


>> Yeah.
 Suddenly,
 we're
 talking
 not
 about


whether
 this
 happened
 or
 not,
 but
 about


whether
 it
 was
 legal.
 And
 obviously


those
 two
 things
 are
 very
 different,


>> right?
 And
 so
 the
 administration
 ends
 up


getting
 very
 adamant
 about
 the
 point


that
 Homeman
 makes
 in
 his
 interview
 on


this
 which
 is
 just
 to
 say
 there
 was
 no


crime
 here
 and
 that
 becomes
 a
 kind
 of


mantra
 throughout
 the
 administration
 as


the
 questions
 keep
 coming
 up.


>> Do
 you
 know
 sitting
 here?


>> All
 I
 know
 is
 that
 deputy
 attorney


general
 Todd
 Blanch
 and
 FBI
 Director


Patel
 said
 there
 was
 no
 case.
 and


Caroline.


>> Last
 week,
 there's
 a
 hearing
 before
 the


Senate
 Judiciary
 Committee
 in
 which


Attorney
 General
 Pam
 Bondi
 is
 very


confrontational.


>> If
 you
 work
 for
 me,
 you
 would
 have
 been


fired.


>> She
 is
 adamant
 that
 no
 crime
 was


committed
 and
 she
 basically
 goes
 on
 the


attack
 and
 just
 criticizes
 the
 lawmakers


who
 are
 even
 asking
 the
 question.
 Hm.


>> In
 the
 same
 vein,
 just
 this
 past


weekend,
 the
 vice
 president,
 JD
 Vance,


is
 interviewed
 by
 ABC's
 George


Stephanopoulos,
 and
 he's
 asked
 again


about
 Tom
 Hman
 in
 the
 bag
 of
 cash.


>> Question.
 Are
 you
 saying
 that
 he
 did
 not


accept
 the
 $50,000?


>> Vance's
 answer
 is
 very
 similar
 to


Bondi's.
 The
 question
 is,
 did
 he
 do


something
 illegal?
 And
 there's


absolutely
 no
 evidence
 that
 Tom
 Hol,


which
 is
 why
 he's
 working
 in
 the


administration.
 He
 insists
 no
 crime
 was


committed.
 and
 again
 goes
 on
 the
 attack


for
 even
 asking
 the
 question.


>> Of
 course,
 this
 administration
 dropped


the
 investigation
 before
 they
 could


actually
 prove
 whether
 or
 not
 a
 crime


was
 being
 committed.
 So,
 Develin,
 what


do
 you
 make
 of
 their
 argument?


>> So,
 on
 a
 political
 level,
 their
 argument


is
 very
 simple.
 This
 was
 a
 partisan


witch
 hunt
 generated
 by
 the
 last


Democratic
 administration.
 The
 legal


argument
 is
 actually
 a
 little
 more


complicated
 and
 it
 touches
 on
 a
 lot
 of


things.
 First,
 I
 would
 just
 say
 not


everyone
 inside
 the
 Justice
 Department


has
 the
 exact
 same
 view
 about
 this
 case.


I
 have
 talked
 to
 people
 who
 feel
 very


strongly
 that
 it
 was
 a
 very
 strong
 case,


a
 chargeable
 case,
 a
 pursuable
 case,
 and


it's
 frustrating
 to
 those
 people
 that


the
 case
 was
 dropped.
 I
 have
 talked
 to


other
 people
 inside
 the
 department
 who


have
 made
 the
 argument,
 look,
 this
 was
 a


great
 beginning
 of
 a
 case.
 We
 had
 not


finished
 the
 case
 and
 it's
 not
 a


terrific
 case
 without
 more
 evidence.


So,
 there
 aren't
 universal
 views
 about


this
 even
 inside
 the
 department.
 But
 it


also,
 this
 case
 speaks
 to
 what's
 really


a
 long-running
 disagreement
 about


whether
 or
 not
 the
 Justice
 Department
 is


overusing
 and
 stretching
 corruption
 laws


beyond
 what
 they
 were
 intended
 to
 do.


And
 over
 a
 number
 of
 years,
 the
 Supreme


Court
 has
 basically
 whittleled
 away
 at


how
 federal
 corruption
 laws
 can
 be
 used


and
 has
 repeatedly
 sent
 a
 signal
 to
 the


Justice
 Department
 that
 certainly
 the


conservatives
 on
 the
 court
 believe
 that


the
 Justice
 Department
 is
 in
 many
 cases


misusing
 or
 overusing
 corruption


statutes
 to
 go
 after
 politicians.


meaning
 there's
 a
 disagreement
 within


the
 legal
 community
 about
 what
 actually


constitutes
 corruption
 or
 at
 least


what's
 the
 threshold
 for
 proving
 it
 in


court.


>> Well,
 exactly.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 ways
 that


this
 case
 gets
 argued
 about
 among


lawyers
 is
 there's
 something
 called


stream
 of
 benefits
 corruption
 which


makes
 the
 argument
 that
 you
 don't
 need
 a


very
 explicit
 quid
 proquo.
 You
 don't


need
 a
 very
 explicit
 you
 give
 me
 X


dollars
 and
 I
 will
 do
 Y
 for
 you.
 soprano


style,


>> right?
 That
 what
 you
 can
 have
 is
 a
 sort


of
 corrupt
 flow
 relationship
 where
 I
 do


the
 following
 things
 for
 you,
 like
 cash,


and
 you
 in
 exchange
 do
 the
 following


things
 for
 me,
 like
 official
 favors,


like
 getting
 contracts,
 but
 the
 court


has
 to
 believe
 that
 it's
 explicit.
 It


can't
 just
 be
 a
 vague
 set
 of
 actions.


That's
 the
 argument
 for
 how
 you
 could


charge
 a
 case
 like
 this.


So,
 there
 are
 obviously
 a
 lot
 of
 open


legal
 questions
 here
 and
 maybe
 what
 the


FBI
 had
 in
 its
 hands
 wasn't
 an
 open
 and


shut
 case
 yet.
 But
 Homeman
 taking
 this


money
 as
 a
 lawman,
 as
 the
 chief


spokesman
 of
 this
 administration's


immigration
 policy,
 it
 does
 raise
 all


sorts
 of
 questions
 and
 the


administration
 not
 following
 up
 also


raises
 questions.
 I
 guess
 what
 I'm


wondering,
 Develin,
 is
 there's
 been
 so


many
 similar
 scandals
 swirling
 around


the
 Trump
 administration
 at
 this
 point.


Allegations
 of
 corruption
 from
 crypto
 to


the
 free
 airplane.


A
 lot
 of
 those
 have
 kind
 of
 faded
 away


in
 the
 fire
 hose
 of
 news
 that
 we
 are
 all


experiencing
 on
 a
 day-to-day
 basis.
 But


this
 one
 has
 kind
 of
 outlived
 the
 Trump


news
 cycle.
 Why?
 I
 mean,
 look,
 as


someone
 who
 covers
 the
 Justice


Department
 and
 the
 FBI,
 I
 will
 tell
 you


that
 there
 are
 many
 corruption
 cases


that
 are
 hard
 to
 follow,
 hard
 to


explain,
 hard
 to
 just
 unravel
 and


unpack.
 Crypto
 isn't
 an
 easy
 thing
 to


explain.


>> Sure.


>> You
 know
 what
 is
 easy
 to
 explain?
 I
 have


a
 bag
 full
 of
 cash.
 That's
 pretty


simple.
 Why
 did
 he
 take
 a
 bag
 of
 cash?


What
 did
 he
 do
 with
 the
 cash?
 Hm.


>> And
 in
 addition
 to
 how
 simple
 a
 bag
 of


cash
 is,
 we
 know
 from
 the
 reporting
 that


an
 audio
 tape
 exists
 somewhere,


>> right?
 And
 that
 tape
 could
 be
 released.


People
 could
 start
 demanding
 its


release,


>> right?
 So
 if
 you
 think
 for
 a
 minute


about
 the
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 case,


obviously
 the
 Tom
 Hman
 case
 is
 not
 the


Jeffrey
 Epstein
 case.


>> Epste
 is
 a
 completely
 different
 type
 of


case
 with
 a
 completely
 different


history.


>> Yep.
 But
 the
 demand
 to
 release
 the
 Tom


Hman
 tape
 is
 in
 some
 ways
 very
 similar


to
 the
 demands
 to
 release
 the
 Epstein


files
 because
 it's
 a
 simple


straightforward
 question
 and
 it
 it
 sort


of
 when
 you
 are
 told
 no,
 it
 begs
 the


question,
 well,
 why
 is
 the
 answer
 no?


>> Can
 I
 just
 ask,
 do
 we
 know
 what
 happened


to
 the
 money,
 the
 50,000?


>> We
 really
 don't.
 A
 lot
 of
 what
 you've


seen
 since
 the
 initial
 reporting
 is


people
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 the
 answer


to
 that
 question,
 but
 the
 administration


really
 won't
 tell
 us
 and
 uh
 Homeman
 so


far
 hasn't
 told
 us.


So
 the
 case
 may
 be
 dead,
 but
 I
 think


what
 hasn't
 died
 is
 people's
 desire
 to


know
 the
 answer
 to
 that
 question.
 So
 I


think
 for
 the
 foreseeable
 future,


wherever
 Tom
 Hman
 goes,
 he's
 going
 to
 be


asked
 that
 question.


What
 did
 you
 do
 with
 the
 money?


Well,
 Develin,
 thanks
 so
 much
 for
 coming


on
 the
 show.


>> Thanks
 for
 happening.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 should
 know
 today.


On
 Tuesday,
 President
 Trump
 announced


that
 the
 US
 had
 killed
 six
 men
 aboard
 a


boat
 off
 the
 coast
 of
 Venezuela,
 the


fifth
 known
 strike
 on
 a
 boat
 in
 the


Caribbean
 Sea
 since
 September.
 He
 said


the
 men
 had
 been
 transporting
 drugs,
 but


provided
 no
 evidence
 to
 support
 that


claim.
 And
 while
 he
 posted
 a
 video
 of


the
 attack,
 the
 president
 offered
 no


details
 about
 the
 nationality
 of
 the


suspects
 and
 didn't
 identify
 them
 as


belonging
 to
 any
 particular
 criminal


group.


The
 US
 military
 has
 now
 killed
 27
 people


in
 these
 boat
 attacks,
 treating
 them
 as


if
 they
 were
 enemy
 soldiers
 in
 the


middle
 of
 a
 war
 zone
 rather
 than


criminal
 suspects.


And


>> it's
 a
 great
 honor
 to
 have
 the
 leader
 of


Argentina,
 a
 place
 that
 I
 love.
 I've


been
 to
 and
 one
 of
 the
 most
 beautiful


places
 in
 the
 world.
 President
 and
 I


really
 want
 to
 thank
 you
 very
 much.


>> Trump
 hosted
 Argentinian
 President


Javier
 Malay
 at
 the
 White
 House
 on


Tuesday
 just
 days
 after
 the
 US
 agreed
 to


move
 ahead
 with
 a
 20
 billion
 bailout
 of


Argentina.


>> We
 think
 he's
 going
 to
 win.
 He
 should


win.
 And
 if
 he
 does
 win,
 we're
 going
 to


be
 very
 helpful.
 And
 if
 he
 doesn't
 win,


we're
 not
 going
 to
 waste
 our
 time


because
 you
 you
 have
 somebody
 whose


philosophy
 has
 no
 chance
 of
 making


Argentina
 great
 again.


>> Trump
 explicitly
 tied
 US
 economic


support
 for
 the
 country
 to
 the
 political


fortunes
 of
 Malay,
 who's
 trying
 to
 save


off
 a
 financial
 meltdown
 at
 home
 and


whose
 party
 is
 facing
 tough
 midterm


elections
 this
 month.
 Trump
 acknowledged


that
 the
 bailout
 was
 intended
 to
 support


the
 Argentinian
 leaders
 fiscally


conservative
 policies
 and
 wouldn't
 make


a
 big
 difference
 for
 the
 US.
