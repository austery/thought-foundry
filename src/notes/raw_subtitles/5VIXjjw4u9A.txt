[Music]


hi
 everybody
 and
 welcome
 to
 in
 Good


Company
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 and
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today
 we


have
 an
 incredible
 guest
 Robin
 Zang
 the


founder
 and
 CEO
 of
 catl
 the
 world


largest
 battery
 producer
 now
 it's
 not


only
 the
 world
 largest
 it's
 got
 a


whopping
 40%
 of
 this
 Mega
 Market
 wow
 so


Robin
 how
 did
 this
 come
 about
 how
 is
 it


possible
 to
 end
 up
 with
 40%
 of
 such
 a


big
 Market
 no
 no
 not
 not
 yet
 40%
 okay
 to


be
 correct
 it's


37.5%
 something
 that
 less
 than
 40
 but
 I


think
 the
 most
 important
 is
 L
 products


definitely
 the
 market
 need
 a
 lot
 of


right
 products
 to
 do
 the
 uh


immobility
 so
 right
 product
 you
 need
 the


right
 uh
 technology
 so
 in
 our
 world
 is


more
 like
 a
 ra
 chemical
 ra
 material


which
 really
 have
 a
 good
 product


so
 this
 group
 product
 is
 a
 finished
 to


the
 purpose
 of
 the
 consumer
 that's
 why


consumer
 really
 love
 that
 that's
 why
 the


customers


alls
 would
 like
 to
 make
 these
 products


and
 put
 this
 product
 into
 their
 car


that's
 why
 we
 can
 power
 the
 millions
 of


cars
 so
 um
 despite
 your
 uh
 incredible


Market
 position
 there
 may
 be
 some


listeners
 who
 don't
 uh
 know
 what
 your


products
 are
 so
 just
 uh
 very
 briefly


what
 type
 of
 products
 do
 you
 have
 we


have
 h
 two
 major
 product
 one
 is
 the


battery
 we
 call
 a
 battery
 for
 the


immobility
 so
 you
 can
 have
 the
 product


in
 the
 Tesla's
 car
 model
 3
 Model
 one
 so


in
 all
 the
 Chinese
 car
 makers
 or
 also
 in


many
 of
 omm's
 cars
 so
 this
 battery
 we


call
 to
 power
 the
 whole
 car
 so
 is
 a
 b
 b


another
 product
 is
 we
 make
 a
 battery
 for


the
 energy
 storage
 you
 know
 all
 the


renewable
 energy
 like
 a
 wind
 turbine
 and


the
 solar
 cell
 that's
 why
 you
 need
 a
 a


storage
 battery
 who
 can
 storage
 regulate


the
 uh
 unstabled
 renewable
 energy


supplies
 which
 make
 this
 energy
 Supply


become
 very
 stable
 very
 predictable
 and


very
 Fitness
 to
 the
 industry
 use
 and


other
 use
 what's
 been
 the
 main
 steps
 uh


from
 uh
 going
 from
 kind
 of
 zero
 to
 uh


37.5%
 world
 market
 share
 how
 long
 has
 it


taken
 you
 yeah
 we
 take
 almost
 uh
 12


years
 to
 from
 zero
 to
 the
 to
 this
 uh


37.5%
 the
 major
 is
 not
 because
 of
 this


this
 only
 this
 12
 years
 because
 our
 team


have
 been
 working
 on
 this
 industry
 for


now
 it's
 a
 quarter
 Century
 25
 years
 ago


we
 start
 business
 with
 this
 L
 ion


battery
 which
 is
 definitely
 is
 for
 the


mobile
 phone
 for
 The
 Notebook
 for
 the


all
 the
 consumer
 electronic
 applications


so
 we
 have
 the
 similar
 technology
 from


from
 25
 years
 ago
 who
 do
 you
 consider


your
 competitors
 uh
 today
 I
 think
 uh
 the


competitor
 is
 ourself
 because
 we
 don't


have
 uh
 we
 still
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 to
 do


especially
 on
 the
 uh
 electrical
 chemical


side
 you
 know
 the
 material
 today
 we


still
 in
 Castle
 material
 uh
 like
 lium


ion
 phosphate
 and
 the
 NCM
 and
 the


material
 still
 on
 the
 quy
 some


silicon
 most
 important
 is
 the
 new


chemistries
 we
 have
 to
 invent
 so
 only


invent
 the
 new
 chemistries
 can
 also
 fit


more
 usage
 more
 requirement
 from


consumer
 for
 example
 low
 temperature


performance
 you
 say
 that
 uh
 your


competitor
 is
 yourself
 are
 you
 not


worried
 about
 any
 other
 competitors
 I


don't
 consider
 them
 as
 a
 competitors


actually
 we
 love
 to
 have
 more
 people


join
 in
 this
 journey
 which
 you
 really


can
 have
 the
 inventions
 it's
 not
 a


copycat
 it's
 a
 inventions
 which
 is
 can


help
 to
 make
 the
 consumer
 make
 the


customer
 happy
 with
 their
 real
 good


performance
 of
 the
 products
 and


Technologies
 because
 only
 the


competitions
 in
 the
 invention


competitions
 in
 the
 creativity
 which
 can


help
 this
 industry
 very
 healthy
 to
 grow


in
 the
 Futures
 and
 how
 important
 is
 uh


uh
 State
 support
 in
 getting
 uh
 to
 that


type
 of
 position
 but
 in
 China
 is
 uh
 more


more
 complicated
 because
 uh
 Chinese
 try


to
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 products
 which
 fit
 to


the
 consumer
 usage
 so
 uh
 Chinese
 o
 more


like
 a
 we
 we
 we
 call
 it
 hearing
 more
 the


request
 from
 the
 consumer
 then
 they
 make


it
 a
 good
 design


faster
 than
 anyone
 else
 in
 the
 in
 the


world
 that's
 why
 they
 can
 roll
 out
 a
 lot


of
 good
 products
 so
 in
 order
 to
 support


the
 trines
 OEM
 on
 this
 aspect
 seat
 have


been
 you
 know
 being
 well
 trained
 to
 how


to
 quick
 faster
 grass
 and
 how
 to
 quick


faster
 to
 remark
 the
 production
 to


support
 that
 the
 cost
 performance


effectively
 and
 the
 quality
 high
 quality


products
 to
 our
 customer
 let's
 the
 whole


story
 make
 a
 difference
 you
 know
 it's


complicated
 that's
 why
 it's
 good
 that


you
 have
 a
 PhD
 but
 um
 um
 how
 many
 people


have
 you
 got
 in
 uh
 in
 research
 and


development
 yeah
 we
 have
 more
 than


20,000
 uh
 people
 engineer
 very
 good


talents
 in
 my
 uh
 area
 because
 uh
 uh
 they


need
 a
 focus
 on
 many
 aspects
 but
 I
 mean


20
 20,000
 is
 nearly
 as
 many
 people
 that


live
 in
 my
 hometown
 so
 what
 do
 they
 do


uh
 least
 20,000
 people
 is
 uh
 some
 people


is
 focus
 on
 the
 basic
 material


structures
 some
 people
 is
 focus
 on


cations
 some
 people
 is
 focus
 on
 the


interation
 of
 the
 materials
 some
 people


is
 focus
 on
 the
 future
 chemistry
 for


example
 we
 call
 AI
 for
 Science
 and
 need


to
 use
 artificial
 intellig
 to
 try
 to


find
 out
 the
 next
 revolutionary
 material


and
 the
 chemical
 system
 beyond
 the
 LM


ions
 we
 need
 to
 have
 some
 research
 guide


on
 the
 you
 know
 on
 the
 battery


Management
 systems
 and
 softwares
 all


together
 like
 20


21,000
 uh
 Engineers
 they
 have
 uh
 sever


hundred
 phds
 you
 know
 many
 many
 Masters


so
 loan
 kids
 have
 been
 working
 here


for
 average
 more
 than
 three
 or
 five


years
 they
 they
 have
 become
 very
 good
 T


and
 I
 hope
 uh
 they
 can
 have
 more


Innovations
 in
 the
 future
 to
 help
 the


the
 human
 uh
 climate
 changing
 focus
 on


these
 uh
 uh
 renewable
 energies
 the


talent
 pool
 you
 have
 uh
 is
 incredible


right
 I
 saw
 that
 two
 out
 of
 three
 widely


cited
 papers
 on
 Battery
 Technology
 came


out
 of
 China
 uh
 only
 12%
 coming
 out
 of


the
 US
 also
 you
 in
 China
 have
 more
 than


50
 graduate
 programs
 in
 batteries


compared
 to
 only
 a
 few
 uh
 in
 the
 US
 so


um
 how
 how
 can
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world


possibly
 compete
 with
 you
 almost
 12


years
 ago
 uh
 when
 the
 Angela
 M
 visit


China
 we
 have
 some
 discussions
 among


that
 in
 that
 time
 the
 German
 people


already
 thinking
 about
 how
 why
 they


cannot
 make
 a
 good
 batteries
 because


they
 make
 a
 very
 good
 engines
 they
 make


a
 very
 good
 gear
 boss
 so
 uh
 you
 know


German
 people
 think
 they
 can
 make
 a
 very


good
 batteries
 that's
 why
 when
 we
 have


some
 discussions
 on
 that
 I
 told
 them


fortunately
 unfortunately
 is
 uh
 China


have
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 universi
 still
 working


on
 the
 electrical
 chemical
 so
 usually


electrical
 chemistry
 is
 uh
 is
 very
 low


end
 people
 looking
 at
 because
 if
 you


graduate
 from
 electrical
 chemistry
 you


cannot
 find
 a
 good
 job
 you
 know
 you
 can


only
 find
 uh
 people
 for
 the
 L
 abilities


you
 only
 find
 a
 job
 for
 the
 antic
 cions


so
 all
 this
 kind
 of
 uh
 low
 pay
 job


that's
 why
 uh
 they
 being
 very
 old
 uh
 uh


Theory
 but
 uh
 I
 know
 United
 States
 a
 lot


of
 good
 universities
 and
 the
 students


they
 don't
 want
 to
 focus
 on
 this
 they


want
 to
 focus
 on
 finance
 focus
 on
 the
 uh


semiconductors
 yeah
 they
 need
 to
 get
 a


higher
 pay
 from
 the
 leas
 but
 the
 China


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 know
 students
 who


uh
 have
 to
 go
 into
 University
 that's
 why


they
 found
 more
 M
 study
 on
 the


electrical
 chemistries
 that's
 why
 we


have
 a
 lot
 of
 talents
 compared
 to
 us


compared
 to
 Germany
 so
 if
 us
 Germany


want
 to
 catch
 up
 or
 want
 to
 overtake
 in


the
 bar
 side
 probably
 they
 have
 to


startop
 from


the
 uh
 education
 have
 you
 got
 a
 view
 on


the
 amount
 of
 talent
 we
 have
 in


Norway
 uh
 I
 think
 all
 20,000
 people
 in


your
 hometown
 is
 all
 talents
 so
 we
 need


to
 find
 out
 what
 kind
 of
 talents
 to
 F


what
 kind
 of
 use
 may
 not
 be
 electrical


chemistry
 what's
 the
 most
 difficult


thing
 is
 it
 to
 uh
 uh
 to
 invent
 a
 battery


or
 is
 it
 the
 scaling
 of
 battery


production
 you
 know
 is
 it
 more
 difficult


to
 make
 one
 or
 to
 make
 a
 thousand
 so


most
 difficult
 things
 is
 understanding


of
 electrical
 chemical
 system
 in
 the


real
 world
 and
 uh
 other
 things
 is
 follow


is
 like
 a
 as
 I
 mentioned
 you
 have
 to


last
 20
 25
 years
 let's
 TR
 how
 you


predict
 that
 and
 uh
 accurately
 A
 cation


test
 to
 indicate
 is
 already
 can
 reach


that
 kind
 of
 level
 uh
 is
 another


difficulty
 in
 reliabilities
 so
 and
 the


scale
 up
 uh
 Productions
 and
 you
 know
 low


cost
 everyone
 looking
 for
 very
 low
 cost


battery
 because
 they
 always
 compare
 the


battery
 with
 the
 Gathering
 engine


internal
 combustion
 engine
 which
 have


developed
 more
 than
 100
 years
 optimize


and
 optimized
 that's
 why
 they
 push
 too


much
 burden
 on
 the


batteries
 it
 just
 seems
 like
 um
 uh
 in


Europe
 there
 is
 such
 a
 problem
 scaling


up
 production
 is
 there
 one
 common
 thing


that's
 particularly
 difficult
 here
 I


talk
 to
 the
 many
 people
 European
 battery


maker
 CEO
 W
 canot
 make
 a
 a
 good
 product


it's
 because
 they
 have
 a
 wrong
 design


and
 secondly
 they
 have
 a
 wrong
 process


thirdly
 they
 have
 a
 wrong
 equipments
 how


can
 they
 scale
 up
 if
 they
 want
 to
 scale


up
 a
 l
 they
 would
 be
 have
 a
 you
 problem


you
 utilization
 problem
 and
 later
 on


there
 will
 be
 a
 Rel
 reliability
 problem


and
 two
 year
 or
 3
 years
 later
 there
 will


be
 a
 safety
 problem
 so
 almost
 all


mistake
 together
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 how


that
 doesn't
 sound
 so
 good
 but
 if
 we


start
 with
 the
 first
 one
 when
 you
 said


they
 got
 the
 wrong
 design
 what
 do
 you


mean
 yes
 stuff
 from
 the
 wrong
 design
 it


means
 they
 if
 they
 don't
 understand
 the


electrical
 chemistry
 or
 side
 reation
 as


I
 mentioned
 the
 design
 will
 be
 wrong


they
 never
 cover
 the
 risk
 of
 the
 future


risk
 that's
 why
 the
 performance
 testing


in
 one
 day
 looks
 good
 then
 you
 want
 to


scale
 up
 then
 you
 want
 to
 put
 the


process
 the
 process
 never
 cover
 what
 you


need
 in
 the
 future
 what
 are
 the


applications
 for
 European
 battery


production
 then
 given
 what
 you
 saying


where
 do
 you
 think
 Europe
 is
 going
 to
 be


in
 10
 years
 time
 for
 the
 battery


application
 side
 we
 we
 we
 we
 just
 tell


about
 at
 Le
 immobility
 and
 the
 boat
 also


and
 ioto
 also
 uh
 even
 a
 bullly
 TR
 and


the
 and
 the
 kai
 is
 definitely
 since
 in


Norway
 is
 definitely
 a
 very
 Advanced
 uh


Nations
 for
 this
 renewable
 energy
 maybe


we
 can
 work
 together
 to
 make
 a
 planning


to
 make
 a
 Norway
 the
 whole
 Norway
 become


a
 zero
 carbon
 you
 know
 Society
 so
 I
 have


a
 confidence
 how
 to
 mapping
 up


electricity
 zeroc
 carbon
 is
 important


you
 have
 almost
 90%
 Hydro
 power
 right


then
 you
 add
 up
 another
 10%
 maybe
 from


the
 winter
 by
 from
 the
 from
 the
 sea
 and


uh
 and
 another
 size
 is
 uh
 immobilities


your
 passenger
 car
 penetration
 you
 know


already
 90
 95%
 of
 the
 new
 cars
 then
 we


can
 also
 can
 help
 you
 to
 make
 these


trucks
 to
 be
 zero
 carbon
 by
 our
 swapping


battery
 system
 and
 also
 we
 can
 make
 it
 a


PT
 electrifications
 and
 also
 can
 help


also
 even
 the
 westel
 uh
 with
 the
 we
 call


the
 rer
 standard
 so
 we
 can
 planning


together
 to
 make
 a
 whole
 Norway


as
 a
 number
 one
 in
 the
 world
 to
 be
 the


zero
 carbon
 technology
 renewable
 energy


nations
 in
 the
 world
 I
 think
 it
 take


around
 10
 years
 in
 2025
 what
 togethera


will
 be
 make
 it
 and
 also
 you
 would
 be


very
 happy
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 of


income
 from
 all
 this
 kind
 of
 different


uh
 you
 know
 different


things
 well
 uh
 sounds
 very
 interesting


unfortunately
 it's
 above
 my
 pay
 grade


it's
 not
 my
 decision
 I
 only
 invest
 money


you
 know
 and
 uh
 of
 course
 we
 happy
 that


we
 have
 invested
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 with
 you


now
 you've
 been
 doing
 batteries
 for
 a


long
 time
 do
 you
 feel
 that
 uh
 Innovation


is
 accelerating
 or
 decelerating
 I
 don't


see
 too
 much
 is
 actually
 acceleration


you
 know
 when
 the
 industry
 is
 small
 when


we
 start
 from
 the
 uh
 uh
 uh
 mobile


phone
 the
 technology
 like
 a
 growing
 like


a
 a
 line
 not
 as
 relations
 but
 when
 to


put
 more
 money
 more
 people
 inside
 now


everyone
 looking
 for
 the
 Innovations
 so


Innovations
 big
 is
 access
 relate
 and
 uh


we
 believe
 there
 will
 be
 another
 new


industry
 a
 new
 chemistry
 come
 out
 that's


why
 uh
 when
 we
 put
 our
 product
 when
 we


invest
 our
 production
 line
 we
 have
 to


put
 the
 production
 Li
 have
 to
 depreciate


faster
 the
 depreciation
 have
 to
 be
 5


years
 otherwise
 uh
 we
 want
 it
 so
 new


things
 come
 out
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 companies


push
 kind
 of
 solid
 state
 batteries
 it's


a
 game
 changer
 what
 are
 the
 showstoppers


here
 well
 I
 have
 been
 taught
 this
 for
 uh


many
 many
 times
 of
 the
 different
 people


uh
 the
 basic
 show
 stop
 is
 a
 steel
 lay


steel
 is
 the
 interface
 solid
 and
 solid


interface
 whenever
 Castle
 material
 with


the


electrolyte
 so
 solid
 electrolyte
 solid


powder
 so
 in
 anal
 material
 or
 solid


powder
 solid
 solid
 interface
 definitely


the
 problem
 of
 the


diffusions
 the
 speak
 of
 the
 diffusion
 is


almost
 uh
 two
 others
 less
 than
 a
 liquid


electroly
 that's
 why
 people
 have
 to
 put


the
 pressure
 to
 put
 the
 two
 solid
 powder


together
 very
 heavy
 pressures
 then
 make


it
 works
 but
 in
 the
 real
 application


days
 how
 can
 you
 get
 the
 the
 heavy


pressures
 so
 that's
 why
 it
 is
 a


fundamental
 uh
 Science
 and
 Technology


issues
 but
 we
 have
 to
 overcome
 by


different
 things
 different
 uh
 different


new
 invention
 of
 the
 materials
 and
 new


invention
 of
 the
 process
 so
 it
 take
 time


so
 in
 terms
 of
 Technology
 Readiness


level
 I
 put
 it
 at
 a
 four
 level
 four
 you


also
 in
 sodium
 ion
 and
 condensed
 metal


batteries
 how
 do
 you
 view
 these


Technologies
 the
 sodium
 ion
 is
 quite


mature
 now
 we
 already
 have
 the


production
 uh
 small
 production
 to
 the


some
 of
 the
 car
 makers
 the
 only
 problem


is
 the
 quite
 a
 little
 bit
 low
 lower


energy
 density
 compared
 with
 ion


phosphate
 today
 that's
 why
 when
 ion


phosphate
 is
 cheaper
 people
 tend
 to


select
 ion
 phosphate
 rather
 than
 sodium


ion
 but
 we
 have
 developing
 the
 second


generation
 of
 sodium
 ion
 which
 can
 be
 a


very
 good
 compared
 with
 the
 first


generation
 so
 we
 believe
 it
 will
 be
 a
 20


to
 30%
 replacement
 of
 lion
 phosphate
 in


a
 smaller
 car
 on
 the
 shorter
 range
 of


the
 cars
 at
 the
 initial
 stage
 as
 of
 the


that's
 matter
 battery
 is
 uh
 I'm
 proud
 of


that
 because
 uh
 if
 it
 is
 very
 good
 in


imoto
 application
 is
 a
 very
 expensive


today
 and
 uh
 we
 are
 working
 hard
 on
 that


try
 to
 make
 it
 uh
 you
 know
 maybe
 uh
 two


times
 compared
 today
 or
 1.5
 times
 so
 we


can
 use
 this
 battery
 to
 the
 very
 highend


car
 which
 should
 need
 energy
 density
 uh


for
 the
 speed
 on
 the
 higher
 range
 when


you
 look
 at
 your
 process
 and
 so
 on


what's
 the
 key
 to
 your
 your
 successful


supply
 chain
 I
 mean
 you
 for
 instance
 own


your
 own
 lithium
 mine
 right
 what
 are


your
 uh
 advantages
 in
 when
 you
 look
 at


your
 supply
 chain
 usually
 uh
 people
 have


to
 look
 at
 a
 Supply
 Chain
 by
 the


applications
 for
 example
 uh
 several


years
 ago
 people
 say
 wow
 Niel
 cobal
 is


very
 important
 because
 the
 battery
 will


going
 into
 big
 applications
 that's
 why


you
 need
 to
 have
 a
 invest
 in
 nickel
 you


especially
 in
 the
 cobal
 mining
 but
 they


don't
 understand
 is
 we
 can
 have
 uh


making
 the
 structure
 change
 inovations


to
 reduce
 the
 cobal
 applications
 so


cobal
 from
 33%
 reduced
 to


3%
 and
 also
 even
 now
 we
 can
 remove
 the


cobal
 then
 we
 use
 the
 ion
 phosphate
 then


the
 cobal
 become
 zero
 nickel
 become
 zero


so
 the
 only
 the
 technology
 people
 who


understand
 the
 trend
 of
 the
 developing


applications
 in
 the
 future
 who
 to
 know


who
 to
 choose
 what
 kind
 of
 uh
 mining
 is


a
 good
 mining
 Investments
 that
 probably


is
 our
 advantage
 so
 we
 have
 to
 very


carefully
 understand
 the
 advantage
 of


the
 different
 material
 and
 especially


where
 chemistry
 system
 who
 will
 be
 the


winner
 then
 we
 can
 judge
 and
 how
 do
 you


benefit
 from
 this
 when
 you
 set
 of


factories
 in
 Europe
 I
 have
 two
 Factory


in
 Europe
 one
 is
 in
 Germany
 now
 one
 is


in
 uh
 uh
 Hungary
 now
 the
 supply
 chain
 we


establish
 the
 uh
 supply
 chain
 gradually


now
 still
 majority
 from
 China
 That's
 why


for
 example
 in
 Norway
 we
 definitely
 we


can
 work
 together
 for
 because
 you
 have
 a


very
 low
 cost
 of
 the
 hydro
 Powers
 so
 we


can
 make
 graph
 graphite
 together
 so
 you


know
 graphite
 is
 a
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 is
 the
 energy
 consumption


changing
 t
 a
 bit
 uh
 energy
 storage
 how


do
 you
 see
 that
 market
 developing
 uh


energy
 storage
 uh
 in
 my
 mind
 is
 uh
 is
 a


similar
 or
 maybe
 half
 maybe
 half
 size
 of


Transportation
 but
 energ
 storage
 is
 more


difficult
 than
 Transportation
 you
 know


because
 they
 lasting
 they
 need
 lasting


20
 25
 years
 but
 many
 people
 think
 this


is
 easier
 because
 they
 say
 this
 is
 a


stationary
 p
 no
 don't
 move
 uh
 yes
 or
 no


number
 two
 is
 the
 en
 story
 usually
 is
 a


huge
 pack
 for
 example
 One
 gwatt
 battery


pack
 whole
 system
 it
 contains
 at
 least


1.5
 million
 cells
 if
 think
 about
 1.5


million
 cells
 plus
 all
 the
 electronics


Mechanicals
 somal
 managements
 put
 into


the
 system
 and
 plus
 in
 this
 software
 the


whole
 1
 GW
 hour
 batteries
 energy
 storage


system
 contains
 maybe
 7
 to
 maybe
 9


million
 of
 the
 components
 similar
 as
 the


Bing
 787
 so
 when
 you
 control
 your


quality
 in
 the
 one
 out
 of
 the
 pp
 PPM


that
 means
 every
 day
 you
 have
 the


product
 you
 have
 the
 components
 a


problem
 you
 have
 to
 maintain
 that
 you


have
 to
 repair
 that
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of


maintenance
 cost
 in
 the
 future
 and
 also


degradation
 is
 differ
 consistency
 is


very
 very
 difficult
 to
 control
 that's


why
 for
 C
 we
 want
 to
 put
 the
 battery


manufacturing
 quality
 up
 to
 PPP
 level


one
 parts
 per
 billion
 so
 three
 orders


increase
 the
 quality
 level
 to
 fit
 for


the
 usage
 of
 this
 energy
 storage
 so
 it's


difficult
 yeah
 every
 if
 you
 everyone


tell
 you
 it's
 good
 you
 know
 10
 years


later
 they
 to
 pay
 maybe
 5
 years
 later


they
 have
 to
 pay
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 how
 much


time
 do
 you
 spend
 on
 the
 corpor
 culture


at
 catl
 what
 do
 you
 think
 defines
 the


the
 culture
 compared
 to
 other
 companies


uh
 our
 culture
 is
 uh
 uh
 we
 have
 a
 wish


we
 try
 to
 be
 a
 very
 innov
 Innovative
 uh


technology
 company
 in
 the
 world


especially
 focus
 on
 the
 renewable
 energy


and
 try
 to
 do
 the
 excellent
 contribution


to
 the
 Human
 Society
 in
 renewable
 energy


IES
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 we
 try
 to
 create
 a


platform
 which
 help
 the
 individuals
 to


fight
 to
 grow
 their
 spirit
 and
 material


well-being
 actually
 is
 money
 so
 we
 need


to
 give
 them
 the
 more
 St
 options
 and


also
 help
 them
 to
 really
 fighting
 for


the
 grow
 uh
 especially
 Innovations
 and


also
 the
 confidence
 bys
 become
 a
 better


man
 the
 focus
 on
 the
 renewable
 energy
 so


people
 people
 believe
 very
 meaningful
 in


this
 journey
 especially
 working
 in
 SEO


now
 it's
 one
 uh
 15
 million
 cars
 uh
 15


million
 cars
 in
 the
 world
 powered
 by


Seattle
 beries
 so
 think
 about
 that
 you


already
 help
 to
 reduce
 a
 lot
 of
 carbon


on
 the
 other
 hand
 we
 are
 keep
 on
 doing


these
 uh
 Innovations
 to
 help
 the
 climate


change
 and
 also
 sustainability
 for
 the


for
 the
 humans
 development
 uh
 we
 try
 to


gain
 the
 same
 vision
 and
 uh
 also
 uh
 we


are
 using
 also
 Chinese
 uh
 uh
 culture
 we


call
 the
 refine
 so
 everyone
 have
 to


Define
 themsel
 and
 enable
 others
 then
 uh


Drive
 Innovation
 so
 we


always
 we
 always
 uh
 how
 to
 say


successfully
 uh
 in
 introduce
 Chinese


traditional
 thinking
 of
 refine
 enable


and
 uh
 strive
 innovation
 and
 Robin
 how


are
 you
 still
 trying
 to
 refine
 the
 way


you
 work
 for
 me
 there's
 two
 way
 one
 is


my
 My
 Philosophy
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 the


I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 the
 rich
 guy
 in
 the


richest
 guy
 or
 whatever
 it
 doesn't


meaning
 so
 I
 want
 to
 uh
 share
 that
 this


uh
 rich
 or
 wealthy
 to
 many
 peoples
 to


try
 to
 create
 the
 good
 so
 Society


especially
 for
 the
 sustainability
 this


is
 a
 number
 one
 refine
 for
 my
 my
 view
 on


my
 uh
 uh
 uh
 wealthy
 second
 is
 uh


I
 need
 to
 refine
 myself
 to
 be
 more


stronger
 body
 you
 know
 otherwise
 it's


always
 tired
 know
 you
 cannot
 fight
 the


patient
 is
 very
 important
 otherwise


cannot
 lasting
 for
 longer
 the
 certain


things
 I'm
 now
 trying
 very
 hard
 to
 find


the
 successors
 so
 this
 is
 three
 three


things
 is
 in
 my
 mind
 now
 is
 my
 more
 top


priorities
 so
 uh
 Robin
 I
 believe
 you
 and


I
 we
 share
 one
 thing
 in
 common
 we
 both


uh
 sleep
 a
 bit
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 day


we
 take
 a
 a
 little
 nap
 in
 the
 office
 yes


this
 is
 a
 No
 Time
 usually
 we
 sleep
 maybe


30
 minutes
 in
 office
 yes
 when
 during
 the


day
 do
 you
 sleep
 1:00
 p.m.
 uh
 something


like
 that
 start
 sleeping
 and
 maybe
 30


minutes
 it's
 good
 enough
 to
 recover
 and


what
 does
 that
 do
 to
 you
 you
 become
 a


more
 you
 know
 energetic
 maybe
 the
 body


is
 physically
 needed
 how
 long
 do
 you


work
 in
 the
 evening
 I
 work


until
 12
 12:00
 around
 that
 12
 12:30


because
 usually
 the
 whole
 days
 working


sleeping
 is
 not
 really
 you
 have
 to
 you


know
 uh
 listen
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the
 some


the
 information
 message
 from
 overse


especially
 you're
 running
 International


companies
 you
 you
 you
 have
 uh


information
 across
 the
 you
 know
 the
 24


hours
 across
 Cloud
 but
 you
 have
 to
 pick


up
 the
 right
 things
 and
 also
 uh
 yeah
 I'm


I'm
 happy
 to
 do
 that
 uh
 basically
 no
 not


much
 problem
 but
 I
 need
 to
 do
 exercise


my
 daughter
 told
 me
 more
 you
 grew
 up
 in


a
 rural
 China
 right
 in
 uh
 ning
 yes
 what


um
 what
 do
 you
 think
 that
 has
 done
 to


you
 as
 a
 person
 to
 come
 from
 a
 rural


Place
 moving
 being
 very
 successful
 how


has
 it
 helped
 you
 in
 your
 business
 we


have
 uh
 very
 difficult
 economics
 and
 my


hometown
 is
 very
 poor
 so
 uh
 for
 me
 is
 in


the
 day
 one
 I
 think
 uh
 we
 are
 we
 have


confidence
 uh
 because
 we
 believe
 we
 can


overcome
 all
 the
 difficulties
 once
 we


have
 a
 chance
 number
 two
 is
 we
 we
 have
 a


very
 strong
 mind
 we
 are
 not
 easy
 to
 be


you
 know
 bat
 anywhere
 because
 we
 have


experience
 number
 three
 is
 we
 are
 not


much
 too
 much
 looking
 at
 the
 the
 wealth


is
 because
 we
 have
 experienc
 so
 poor
 and


we
 are
 we
 have
 no
 problem
 on
 that
 so
 uh


we
 we
 say
 that
 if
 people
 almost
 told
 me


say
 Robin
 why
 don't
 you
 enjoy
 your
 life


life
 you
 know
 you
 can
 buy
 a
 yard
 and


know
 say
 for
 me
 is
 there
 is
 a
 not
 much


joy
 you
 know
 we
 have
 to
 overcome
 the


difficulties
 to
 do
 something
 great
 to
 to


support
 people
 poor
 people
 and
 also


support
 the
 Le
 renewable
 energy
 in
 the


in
 the
 world
 he
 would
 be
 very
 happy
 so


uh
 usually
 I
 uh
 I
 like
 to
 invest
 the
 the


the
 manufacturing
 plant
 in
 the
 in
 the


related
 poor
 area
 what
 kind
 of
 projects


to
 your
 support
 for
 my
 donation
 is


usually
 go
 to
 this
 very
 very
 poor
 the


children
 we
 donate
 some
 money
 for
 them


to
 like
 have
 some
 people
 to
 care
 just


talk
 touch
 or
 you
 know
 play
 together
 so


I
 join
 some
 uh
 uh
 uh
 international


program
 for
 the
 children
 I
 believe
 if
 we


can
 um
 C
 can
 invest
 the
 manufacturing
 PL


in
 some
 poor
 area
 so
 their
 family
 no


need
 to
 move
 out
 to
 come
 come
 out
 to
 the


you
 know
 uh
 big
 city
 to
 work
 to
 leave


the
 children
 in
 the
 hometown
 so
 that's


why
 we
 invest
 the
 the
 manufacturing


place
 in
 guo
 and
 man
 in
 h
 all
 these


areas
 to
 help
 them
 so
 such
 kind
 of


things
 is
 for
 me
 is
 much
 happier
 and
 may


me
 more
 stronger
 in
 the
 in
 the
 in
 the


rural
 area
 when
 you
 meet
 young
 Chinese


people
 what
 advice
 do
 you
 give
 them
 my


advice
 is
 uh
 be
 patient
 strive
 because


you
 have
 your
 chance
 if
 you
 were
 to
 give


advice
 to
 young
 people
 in
 Europe
 and
 the


US
 what
 would
 you
 tell
 them
 I
 think
 is


similar
 usually
 today's
 young
 kids
 want


to
 have
 be
 become
 rich
 very
 fast
 right


so
 be
 patient
 but
 strive
 everyone
 have
 a


chance
 I
 believe
 Robin
 it's
 been
 uh
 a


tremendous
 talking
 to
 you
 it's


incredible
 what
 you
 have
 achieved
 and
 I


have
 to
 say
 I
 am
 uh
 I
 am
 pretty
 happy


I'm
 uh
 not
 your


competitor
 thanks
 a
 million


oh
