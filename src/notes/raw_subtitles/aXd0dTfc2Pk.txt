From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Natalie


Kitrov.
 This
 is
 the
 daily.
 [music]


[music]


President
 Trump's
 trade
 war
 against


China
 has
 so
 [music]
 far
 proven
 much


harder
 to
 win
 than
 his
 administration


ever
 let
 on.
 [music]


And
 it's
 only
 getting
 worse
 as
 China


undertakes
 its
 most
 aggressive
 act
 of


retaliation
 to
 date.


Today,
 [music]
 my
 colleague
 Keith


Bradshshire
 on
 a
 potential
 turning
 point


in
 the
 standoff
 as
 President
 Trump
 meets


this
 week
 with
 Chinese
 leader
 Xi
 Jinping


[music]


and
 what
 will
 be
 their
 first
 talks
 since


the
 trade
 war
 began.


[music]


[music]


It's
 Wednesday,
 [music]
 October
 29th.


Keith,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 us,
 frankly,


started
 to
 feel
 as
 though
 this
 trade
 war


may
 have
 finally
 died
 down.
 I
 think
 we


were
 lulled
 perhaps
 into
 a
 false
 sense


of
 calm
 when
 there
 wasn't
 that
 much
 news


on
 this
 for
 months.
 But
 then
 all
 of
 a


sudden,
 things
 seemed
 to
 heat
 back
 up


again.
 So
 give
 us
 a
 sense
 of
 the
 state


of
 the
 relationship
 right
 now.


>> The
 relationship
 is
 at
 one
 of
 its


tensest
 moments
 in
 years.
 Both
 sides


have
 threatened
 measures
 bordering
 on


economic
 warfare
 against
 each
 other.


There's
 an
 urgency
 to
 resolving
 these


issues
 at
 the
 meeting
 on
 Thursday
 in


South
 Korea
 between
 the
 two
 countries


top
 leaders.
 Here
 in
 Beijing,
 everyone


is
 watching
 to
 see
 can
 they
 reach
 some


kind
 of
 a
 deal
 that
 pulls
 both
 countries


back
 from
 the
 brink.


>> And
 what
 are
 the
 main
 sticking
 points


right
 now
 in
 these
 negotiations?
 Like


what
 do
 we
 expect
 to
 come
 up
 in
 that


meeting?


>> The
 United
 States
 wants
 China
 to
 start


buying
 soybeans
 again.
 China
 has
 a


boycott
 against
 American
 soybeans
 right


now
 because
 of
 its
 unhappiness
 with


American
 policies.
 The
 United
 States


wants
 China
 to
 stop
 shipping
 the


chemicals
 that
 are
 used
 in
 Mexico
 and


Latin
 America
 to
 make
 fentanyl.


China
 wants
 the
 United
 States
 to
 allow


it
 to
 buy
 any
 kinds
 of
 semiconductors
 it


wants,
 including
 some
 of
 the
 most


advanced
 semiconductors
 used
 in


artificial
 intelligence
 and
 high


performance
 military
 systems.
 And
 China


in
 particular
 wants
 America
 to
 distance


itself
 from
 Taiwan,


although
 America
 depends
 enormously
 on


Taiwan
 for
 semiconductors.


But
 hanging
 over
 all
 of
 these
 issues


is
 a
 big
 debate
 over
 rare
 earth
 metals.


China
 is
 threatening
 to
 cut
 off
 much
 of


the
 world's
 supply
 and
 it's
 saying
 that


it
 will
 block
 any
 effort
 outside
 of


China
 to
 manufacture
 rare
 earths
 and


rare
 earth
 magnets
 in
 competition
 with


China.
 Can
 you
 just
 unpack
 what
 exactly


China
 did
 because
 this
 was
 something


that
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 were


talking
 about
 as
 a
 major
 escalation.


There
 were
 new
 restrictions
 right
 on


these
 rare
 earth
 minerals.
 These
 are


critically
 important
 to
 you
 know


everything
 from
 missiles
 to
 cars.
 We


need
 them
 and
 China
 was
 saying
 you
 can't


have
 them.
 What
 exactly
 happened?


>> Rare
 earths
 are
 very
 important
 these


days.
 They
 are
 used
 all
 over
 the
 economy


whether
 it's
 cars,
 computer
 chips,


fighter
 jets,
 missiles.
 China
 controls


the
 materials,
 rare
 earth
 metals
 for


making
 them
 anywhere
 in
 [clears throat]


the
 world.
 And
 it
 has
 put
 already
 in


April
 some
 export
 controls
 on
 supplying


those
 materials.
 And
 on
 October
 9th,


China
 said,
 "We're
 going
 to
 put
 a
 lot


more
 restrictions
 on
 these."
 [music]


China
 is
 expanding
 its
 restrictions
 on


rare
 earth's
 exports.


The
 new
 rules
 do
 three
 things.
 One,
 they


prevent
 the
 West
 from
 being
 able
 to


build
 its
 own
 mines
 [music]
 and


refineries
 and
 magnet
 factories,
 or
 at


least
 they
 make
 it
 much
 more
 difficult


for
 the
 West
 to
 do
 that.


So,
 no
 more
 using
 any
 Chinese
 patents


without
 permission.
 No
 more
 buying


equipment
 from
 China
 to
 do
 any
 of
 this.


And
 China
 makes
 almost
 all
 the
 equipment


for
 mining
 and
 refining
 rare
 earths
 or


making
 magnets.


Second,
 the
 new
 rules
 put
 restrictions


on
 what
 you
 are
 allowed
 to
 move
 across


any
 country's
 borders
 if
 it
 has
 Chinese


magnets
 and
 rare
 earths
 inside
 [music]


it.
 And
 third,
 China
 is
 saying
 for
 the


first
 time
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 restrict


even
 more
 kinds
 of
 rare
 earths
 than
 it


did
 the
 first
 time
 around
 last
 April.


And
 so
 this
 will
 affect
 even
 more


military
 production,
 [music]


for
 example,


making
 it
 hard
 for
 Europe
 to
 build


weapon
 systems
 for
 Ukraine
 or
 for
 Europe


to
 protect
 itself
 against
 Russia.


[music]


>> Mr.
 Trump
 just
 announced
 a
 100%
 add-on


tariff
 to
 China
 for
 their
 export


controls
 on
 rare
 earths.
 [music]


>> And
 look
 at
 this
 selloff


>> tonight.
 The
 stock
 market
 plunging


nearly
 900
 points
 at
 the
 close.


>> This
 is
 China
 versus
 the
 world.
 They


have
 pointed
 a
 bazooka
 at
 the
 supply


chains
 and
 the
 industrial
 base
 [music]


of
 the
 entire
 free
 world.
 And
 that's
 why


Treasury
 Secretary
 Scott
 Bessant
 said


that
 these
 new
 rules
 are
 a
 bazooka
 aimed


at
 the
 entire
 world's
 supply
 chains.


[music]


>> And
 you
 know,
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 have


it.


>> I
 have
 to
 say
 for
 me,
 this
 is
 like
 a


control
 freaks
 approach
 to
 trade


restrictions.
 Is
 this
 normal?
 Like
 do


countries
 typically
 make
 their
 trade


rules
 this
 specific,
 this
 indepth
 so
 as


to
 control
 every
 aspect
 of
 how
 a
 product


is
 used?


>> The
 United
 States
 has
 done
 this
 with
 the


fastest
 semiconductors.


So
 about
 the
 top
 3
 to
 5%
 of
 the
 world's


semiconductors
 do
 have
 these
 very


restrictive
 rules
 from
 the
 United
 States


that
 do
 track
 what
 downstream
 products


they
 are
 later
 built
 into.


What
 is
 new
 and
 different
 about
 China's


rules


is
 that
 China
 is
 putting
 the


restrictions
 on
 a
 raw
 material


and
 then
 saying
 that
 products
 that
 are


later
 manufactured
 from
 that
 raw


material
 are
 also
 restricted.
 So
 in
 a


way
 this
 is
 a
 combination
 of
 the
 US


rules
 on
 semiconductors


combined
 with
 the
 Arab
 oil
 embargo
 in


1973
 against
 the
 United
 States
 and
 its


allies
 which
 was
 aimed
 at
 halting


American
 support
 for
 Israel
 at
 the
 time.


So
 it
 is
 both
 a
 high-tech
 restriction


and
 in
 China's
 case
 it
 is
 now
 also
 a
 raw


material
 restriction
 both
 at
 the
 same


time.
 Can
 I
 ask
 Keith,
 do
 you
 agree
 with


Bessant's
 assessment
 that
 this
 is
 China


pulling
 out
 a
 bazooka?


>> I
 really
 do.
 This
 is
 China
 trying
 to


make
 sure
 that
 it
 controls
 global


commerce
 and
 can
 turn
 on
 and
 off
 the


taps,
 not
 just
 for
 goods
 leaving
 China,


but
 for
 goods
 moving
 across
 Europe,


across
 North
 America,
 across
 South
 Asia,


you
 name
 it.
 This
 is
 seeking
 a
 new


global
 level
 of
 comprehensive


control
 out
 of
 Beijing
 by
 the
 Ministry


of
 Commerce.


>> And
 how
 should
 we
 interpret
 the
 fact


that
 China's
 decided
 to
 do
 this
 now?
 Is


that
 a
 sign
 that
 the
 Chinese
 government


has
 kind
 of
 reached
 a
 point
 of
 no
 return


in
 these
 negotiations
 that
 they're
 using


what
 sounds
 like
 one
 of
 their
 biggest


points
 of
 leverage?
 China
 has
 concluded


that
 it
 benefits
 from
 taking
 very
 strong


stands


towards
 Trump
 and
 also
 towards
 Europe.


This
 is
 a
 China
 that
 is
 not
 allowing


itself
 to
 be
 pushed
 around.
 We've
 now


seen
 top
 Chinese
 leaders
 line
 up
 with


the
 leaders
 of
 Russia
 and
 North
 Korea
 at


military
 parades
 twice
 in
 six
 weeks
 in


Beijing
 and
 then
 in
 Pyongyang.


And
 so,
 China
 has
 really
 in
 some
 ways


embarked
 on
 a
 new
 geopolitical
 stance


and
 a
 new
 economic
 stance
 of
 standing


tough
 against
 the
 West
 to
 protect


China's
 strategic
 interests


>> and
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 us,
 for
 the
 rest
 of


the
 world,
 what
 are
 the
 implications?


>> For
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world,
 this
 could
 be


extremely
 damaging.
 Any
 country
 with
 an


advanced
 manufacturing
 sector
 has
 to
 be


really
 worried
 about
 this.


[music]


[music]


[music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Let's
 talk
 about
 what
 you
 mean,
 Keith,


when
 you
 said
 this
 could
 be
 extremely


damaging.
 Spell
 out
 for
 me
 what
 kind
 of


damage
 we'd
 be
 looking
 at
 in
 the
 US
 with


these
 restrictions.


>> There
 is
 the
 immediate
 damage
 of


American
 companies
 continuing
 to
 have


trouble
 getting
 enough
 rare
 earth


magnets
 just
 to
 make
 their
 day-to-day


products.
 Detroit
 has
 been
 struggling
 to


get
 enough
 brake
 motors,
 steering


motors,
 power
 seat
 motors,
 all
 these


different
 systems
 that
 require
 rare


earth
 magnets.
 And
 as
 more
 of
 these


Chinese
 regulations
 from
 October
 9th


take
 effect,
 it
 will
 become
 even
 harder


for
 American
 companies,
 for
 example,


even
 to
 move
 parts
 across
 the
 border


from
 Mexico
 or
 across
 the
 border
 from


Canada.


>> What
 about
 the
 national
 security


implications
 of
 this?
 because
 you've


told
 us
 rare
 earths
 go
 into
 missiles,
 go


into
 a
 ton
 of
 military
 equipment.


>> The
 West
 is
 already
 having
 trouble
 in


slowing
 down
 production
 of
 some
 military


items
 because
 of
 the
 shortage
 of
 rare


earths.


The
 West
 failed
 to
 stockpile
 these
 rare


earths
 in
 advance.
 And
 so
 the
 military


contractors
 trying
 to
 supply
 Ukraine
 or


trying
 to
 rebuild
 inventories
 in
 the


west
 are
 really
 having
 trouble
 procuring


the
 magnets
 they
 need.
 So
 this
 is
 a
 big


win
 for
 Russia
 because
 the
 West
 really


needs
 these
 rare
 earths
 to
 continue


supplying
 military
 equipment
 to
 Ukraine


to
 defend
 itself.
 And
 now
 that
 supply


has
 been
 cut
 off
 cold
 by
 China.


>> Fascinating.
 This
 clearly
 [snorts]
 has


pretty
 big
 consequences
 for
 Europe,


which
 is
 honestly
 kind
 of
 surprising.
 I


thought
 this
 was
 a
 US
 China
 trade
 war.


Why
 is
 China
 now
 putting
 the
 screws
 to


Europe?
 China
 has
 a
 whole
 separate


dispute
 going
 with
 Europe
 over
 cars.
 The


European
 Union
 became
 very
 concerned


last
 year
 that
 China
 had
 subsidized
 the


development
 of
 electric
 cars
 and
 was


going
 to
 flood
 the
 European
 market
 with


electric
 cars.


And
 so
 the
 European
 Union
 put
 tariffs
 in


place
 and
 there
 was
 a
 big
 loophole
 left


in
 these
 tariffs
 which
 is
 that
 if
 you


put
 a
 tiny
 gasoline
 engine
 in
 along
 with


a
 great
 big
 electric
 system
 in
 these


cars
 then
 you
 don't
 pay
 any
 tariffs
 at


all.
 And
 so
 China
 has
 been
 flooding
 the


European
 market,
 particularly
 this
 year,


with
 exactly
 that
 category
 of
 highly


capable
 electric
 cars
 with
 a
 tiny


gasoline
 engine
 included.
 And
 they
 don't


face
 any
 extra
 tariff.


China
 does
 not
 want
 Europe
 to
 raise
 the


tariffs.
 It
 does
 not
 want
 Europe
 to


close
 the
 hybrid
 loophole.
 So
 China
 is


putting
 a
 lot
 of
 pressure
 on
 Europe.
 And


then
 finally,
 China's
 leaned
 towards


Russia
 on
 the
 Ukraine
 issue.
 China
 wants


Europe
 to
 distance
 itself
 from
 the


United
 States
 in
 NATO.
 So,
 China
 has
 a


lot
 of
 incentives
 to


be
 very
 tough
 with
 Europe
 and
 has
 been


very
 tough
 with
 Europe
 this
 year.


>> Listening
 to
 you,
 Keith,
 I
 have
 to
 say


it
 does
 seem
 as
 though
 China
 has
 the


ability
 to
 inflict
 just
 enormous
 pain


with
 this.
 If
 China
 is
 willing
 to
 go


this
 far
 in
 the
 trade
 war,
 it
 does
 seem


fair
 to
 say
 that
 they
 have
 the
 upper


hand.
 Am
 I
 wrong
 about
 that?


>> Short-term,
 China
 does
 have
 a
 very


strong
 position,
 but
 there
 are
 real


long-term
 dangers
 to
 the
 Chinese
 economy


in
 pursuing
 this
 strategy.
 Hm.


>> So
 many
 multinational
 companies
 have


come
 to
 rely
 on
 China
 for
 part
 or
 all
 of


their
 supplies
 of
 many
 components,
 many


products
 that
 you
 see
 in
 stores
 all
 over


the
 United
 States.
 And
 as
 China
 shows


that
 it's
 willing
 practically
 overnight


to
 halt
 these
 supplies,
 China
 is


damaging
 its
 reputation
 as
 a
 reliable


supplier.
 European
 and
 American


companies
 are
 frantically
 searching
 for


ways
 to
 buy
 more
 from
 Southeast
 Asia,


from
 India,
 and
 from
 elsewhere.


>> So,
 there
 is
 a
 long-term
 interest
 in


China
 in
 not
 taking
 this
 too
 far.
 In


fact,
 it's
 already
 gone
 far
 enough
 that


they
 are
 worried
 in
 China
 that
 they
 may


be
 losing
 their
 appeal
 as
 a
 destination


for
 foreign
 investment.
 Who
 wants
 to


build
 another
 factory
 in
 China
 if
 you're


not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 send
 the
 goods


from
 that
 factory
 out
 of
 China?


>> It's
 interesting.
 It's
 like
 China
 in


trying
 to
 show
 the
 world,
 look,
 you


really
 can't
 live
 without
 us.
 You
 can't


live
 without
 our
 rare
 earths.
 Beijing


may
 actually
 be
 spurring
 the
 world
 to


look
 for
 ways
 to
 live
 without
 it,
 to


find
 a
 way
 to
 reduce
 that
 reliance
 on


China
 for
 just
 about
 everything.
 That
 is


exactly
 right.
 China
 is
 not
 backing
 down


in
 any
 way.
 China
 is
 all
 in
 on


restricting
 rare
 earths.
 That's
 a
 risky


position
 to
 be
 in
 when
 you're
 a
 country


like
 China
 that
 lives
 on
 exports
 even
 as


the
 domestic
 economy
 is
 a
 mess.
 So,


China
 may
 have
 overplayed
 its
 hand.
 But


it
 seems
 equally
 possible,
 plausible


even,
 that
 the
 US
 actually
 overplayed


its
 hand
 because
 it's
 forced
 China
 into


this
 point
 of
 no
 return
 where
 now
 it's


pulling
 out
 the
 big
 guns,
 where
 now
 it's


using
 its
 biggest
 point
 of
 leverage
 and


forcing
 everyone
 into
 a
 corner.


It's
 possible
 the
 US
 has
 overplayed
 its


hand,
 but
 the
 US
 is
 in
 a
 very
 difficult


position


because
 China
 has
 enormous
 overcapacity


of
 factories.
 And
 just
 last
 Thursday,
 we


had
 a
 pivotal
 moment.
 The
 central


committee
 of
 the
 entire
 Communist
 Party


said,
 "We're
 going
 to
 double
 down
 on


manufacturing.
 We
 want
 to
 be
 the
 country


that
 makes
 everything."


And
 that
 is
 a
 direct
 challenge
 to
 the


United
 States
 and
 Europe
 which
 still


have
 some
 manufacturing
 sectors
 and
 to


Japan
 and
 to
 South
 Korea.


This
 emphasis
 on
 making
 practically
 all


kinds
 of
 advanced
 technology
 is
 really
 a


worry.
 And
 so
 the
 United
 States
 is
 on


the
 spot
 now.
 Does
 it
 take
 a
 short-term


strategy
 of


accepting
 a
 deal
 that
 gets
 it
 back
 to


where
 it
 was
 at
 the
 start
 of
 the
 year


but
 risks
 further
 deterioration
 of


what's
 left
 of
 the
 American


manufacturing
 sector
 or
 does
 it
 continue


to
 have
 a
 confrontation
 but
 that
 could


be
 very
 painful?


>> So
 are
 you
 saying
 it's
 possible
 that
 the


US
 overplayed
 its
 hand
 but
 it
 had
 no


other
 option?
 The
 US
 was
 not
 in
 a
 good


position
 to
 begin
 with
 and
 the
 Biden


administration
 had
 struggled
 with
 the


same
 issue.
 The
 Biden
 strategy
 was
 to


proceed
 cautiously
 and
 avoid
 an
 outright


confrontation
 unlike
 Trump.
 But
 the


Biden
 administration
 also
 had
 the


weakness
 of
 not
 really
 slowing
 down


China's
 remarkable
 race
 towards


dominance
 of
 an
 extremely
 wide
 range
 of


manufacturing
 industries.
 And
 so
 the


Trump
 administration
 felt
 a
 need
 to
 go


considerably
 farther
 and
 that
 has
 now


triggered
 an
 outsized
 response
 from


Beijing.
 You're
 sort
 of
 saying
 it's
 like


you're
 damned
 if
 you
 do,
 you're
 damned


if
 you
 don't.
 If
 you
 don't
 go
 hard


enough
 to
 try
 to
 combat
 China's


dominance
 in
 manufacturing,
 nothing


actually
 gets
 done
 about
 it.
 But
 if
 you


do
 go
 too
 hard,
 you
 risk
 eliciting
 this


kind
 of
 really
 potentially
 damaging


retaliation.


>> That's
 exactly
 right,
 Natalie.
 But
 has


all
 this
 poking
 of
 the
 bear
 that
 the


Trump
 administration's
 done
 actually


done
 anything
 to
 slow
 China's


progression
 toward
 the
 most
 dominant


superpower
 manufacturing
 country
 that


we've
 ever
 seen?


>> Yes,
 the
 Trump
 administration
 tariffs


have
 resulted
 in
 a
 significant
 drop
 in


Chinese
 exports
 to
 the
 United
 States,


more
 than
 20%
 this
 year
 compared
 to
 last


year.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 China
 has
 been


ramping
 up
 exports
 to
 other
 countries


such
 as
 Vietnam,
 and
 you
 get
 estimates


that
 as
 much
 as
 85%
 of
 China's
 exports


to
 Vietnam
 then
 end
 up
 in
 the
 United


States.
 So,
 Chinese
 exporters
 have
 been


very
 nimble
 in
 finding
 alternative


routes
 through
 countries
 like
 Vietnam


and
 Mexico
 to
 still
 reach
 the
 US
 market.


But
 the
 Trump
 administration
 felt
 it


needed
 to
 do
 something
 because
 the
 US


industrial
 base
 has
 been
 rapidly


hollowing
 out.
 And
 without
 a
 strong


manufacturing
 sector,
 the
 US
 cannot


remain
 a
 strong
 country
 with
 a
 strong


conventional
 military
 that
 can
 protect


not
 only
 the
 United
 States
 but
 other


democracies
 around
 the
 world.


The
 situation
 you've
 described
 is
 one


where
 the
 stakes
 are
 just
 incredibly


high
 for
 both
 sides.
 So
 at
 this
 meeting


between
 Trump
 and
 she
 this
 week,
 what


should
 we
 expect
 to
 see?
 Do
 you
 expect
 a


dramatic
 announcement
 or
 just
 the


continuation
 of
 what
 we've
 seen
 before,


which
 is
 incremental
 agreements,


temporary
 pauses,


etc.?
 I
 expect
 a
 dramatic
 announcement


of
 temporary
 agreements
 and
 incremental


changes.
 [laughter]


[snorts]
 I
 think
 that
 what
 we
 will
 see


is
 a
 postponement,
 for
 example,
 of


China's
 rare
 earth
 restrictions,
 but
 not


a
 repeal
 of
 them.
 I
 think
 we
 are
 likely


to
 see
 some
 Chinese
 purchases
 of


American
 soybeans,
 but
 not
 on
 a
 scale


that
 they
 previously
 were.


One
 other
 aspect
 that
 we'll
 probably
 see


is
 some
 kind
 of
 Chinese
 promise
 to
 limit


exports
 of
 chemicals
 used
 in
 making


fentinel.


[music]


And
 then
 we
 may
 see
 a
 promise
 to
 get


together
 and
 have
 a
 more
 indepth


conversation
 in
 China
 next
 February.


>> So
 a
 narrow
 deal
 perhaps
 announced
 with


great
 fanfare.
 [music]


>> Exactly.


The
 two
 count's
 leaders
 might
 be
 able
 to


establish
 a
 floor
 for
 the
 relationship


here.
 They
 might
 begin
 to
 change
 the


trajectory
 so
 that
 next
 year
 they
 can


begin
 to
 patch
 together
 something


better.


Because
 if
 they
 don't,
 then
 we
 could
 be


headed
 for
 ever
 greater
 confrontation


between
 two
 superpowers
 with
 enormous


ability
 to
 harm
 each
 other
 and
 the


entire
 world.


>> [music]


>> Well,
 Keith,
 thank
 you.
 Thanks
 for


making
 us
 all
 smarter
 in
 anticipation


[music]
 of
 it.


>> Thank
 you.
 Always
 good
 to
 talk
 to
 you,


Natalie.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 should
 know
 today.


[music]
 Hurricane
 Melissa
 made
 landfall


on
 Tuesday
 and
 it
 carved
 a
 path
 of


destruction
 across
 Jamaica
 as
 one
 of
 the


strongest
 category
 5
 storms
 on
 record.


[music]


It
 wasn't
 clear
 exactly
 how
 much
 damage


Jamaica
 had
 sustained
 because
 of
 limited


communications,
 but
 Jamaican
 officials


said
 that
 [music]
 15,000
 people
 were
 in


government
 shelters.


More
 than
 half
 a
 million
 people
 or
 about


a
 sixth
 of
 the
 country's
 population


[music]


were
 without
 power.


And
 on
 Tuesday,
 Defense
 Secretary
 Pete


Hgsith
 said
 the
 Trump
 [music]


administration
 had
 launched
 yet
 another


round
 of
 deadly
 strikes
 on
 boats
 [music]


that
 it
 claims
 were
 smuggling
 drugs,


killing
 14
 people
 in
 four
 vessels.


Hegath
 said
 the
 [music]
 strikes
 took


place
 in
 international
 waters
 and
 that


there
 had
 been
 one
 survivor.
 The
 attacks


bring
 the
 overall
 death
 [music]
 toll
 in


the
 growing
 US
 military
 campaign
 off
 the


Central
 and
 South
 American
 coasts
 to
 57.


[music]


Finally,
 Prime
 Minister
 Benjamin


Netanyahu
 ordered
 [music]
 the
 Israeli


military
 to
 conduct
 strikes
 in
 Gaza
 on


Tuesday.
 The
 Israeli
 government
 accused


Hamas
 of
 violating
 the
 ceasefire


agreement
 [music]
 by
 firing
 on
 Israeli


forces
 and
 failing
 to
 return
 the
 bodies


of
 dead
 hostages.


Netanyahu's
 office
 said
 the
 [music]


prime
 minister
 had
 informed
 President


Trump
 before
 the
 action
 was
 taken.
 Hamas


denied
 involvement
 in
 an
 attack
 on


[music]
 Israeli
 forces
 and
 in
 a


statement
 said
 it
 remained
 committed
 to


the
 ceasefire
 agreement
 [music]


which
 it
 accused
 Israel
 of
 violating.
