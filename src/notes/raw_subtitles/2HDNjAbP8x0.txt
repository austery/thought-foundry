but
 when
 you
 take
 a
 longer
 term
 view
 you


make
 fewer
 decisions
 the
 fewer
 decisions


you
 make
 the
 better
 they
 tend
 to
 be
 you


know
 if
 you
 make
 one
 decision
 a
 month
 it


tends
 to
 be
 better
 and
 if
 you
 make
 10
 a


day
 good
 afternoon

 and
 what
 he's
 learned


from
 some
 of
 the
 top
 leaders
 in
 the


world
 from
 your
 podcast
 so
 um
 I'm


looking
 forward
 to
 talking
 about
 that


and
 so
 if
 it's
 okay
 we're
 going
 to
 kind


of
 Jump
 Right
 In
 so
 cool
 okay
 well
 so


you're
 coming
 up
 on
 your
 fifth
 year


anniversary
 as
 a
 CO
 of
 noras
 Bank


investment
 management
 Norway's
 $1.7


trillion
 investment
 fund
 and
 the
 fund
 is


up
 60%
 C
 that
 you
 took
 over
 in


2020
 talk
 about
 the
 responsibility
 of


stewarding
 you
 know
 a
 pool
 of
 capital


this
 large
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 how


you
 kind
 of
 think
 about
 that


responsibility
 and
 how
 it's
 kind
 of


framed
 the
 way
 you've
 tried
 to
 set
 this


up
 over
 the
 P
 five
 years
 yeah
 it's
 a
 you


know
 it's
 a
 big
 responsibility
 because


it's
 uh
 it's
 such
 a
 kind
 of
 big
 fund
 for


a
 very
 small
 country
 and
 um
 despite
 we


only
 use
 2
 and
 a
 half%
 of
 the
 fund
 every


year
 it
 it
 provides
 more
 than
 20%
 of
 the


state
 budget
 and
 we
 have
 on
 our
 website


a
 ticker
 which
 is
 the
 live
 value
 of
 the


fund
 and
 is
 updated
 13
 times
 per
 second


so
 uh
 pretty
 kind
 of
 live
 and
 it's
 the


most
 watched
 number
 in
 the
 country
 so


everybody
 is
 focusing
 in
 on
 it
 so
 um
 big


responsibility
 but
 it's
 made
 easier
 by


the
 fact
 that
 we
 have
 a
 mandate
 a
 really


really
 good
 mandate
 which
 is
 uh


basically
 made
 by
 the
 Ministry
 of


Finance
 and
 it's
 got
 broad
 politically


uh
 it's
 broadly
 politically
 anchored
 so


all
 the
 political
 parties
 agree
 with


what
 we're
 doing
 it
 means
 that
 they
 will


not
 change
 their
 mind
 at
 the
 wrong
 time


and
 so
 that's
 good
 and
 then
 also
 of


course
 I
 don't
 do
 it
 on
 my
 own
 we
 are


700
 people
 uh
 really
 really
 great
 team


and
 um
 and
 then
 you
 know
 um
 yes
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 zeros
 uh
 in
 uh
 you
 know


19,000
 billion
 Norwegian
 Groner
 but
 you


don't
 really
 think
 about
 those
 numbers


right
 you
 think
 about
 doing
 the
 right


thing
 doing
 the
 right
 processes
 and
 then


the
 numbers
 would
 follow
 yeah
 I
 I
 know


that
 that
 some
 of
 the
 guiding
 principles


are
 to
 be
 long-term
 oriented
 and


diversified
 but
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about


how
 you
 decide
 where
 to
 invest
 yeah
 and


how
 do
 you
 decide
 where
 not
 to
 invest


yeah
 so
 um
 again
 the
 ministry
 has
 this


mandate
 um
 and
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 we


have
 to
 do
 it
 in
 a
 in
 a
 you
 know
 ethical


way
 so
 we
 have
 a
 separate
 Council
 of


Ethics
 which
 decides
 where
 we
 cannot


invest
 we
 don't
 invest
 in
 in
 Coal
 uh


weapons
 and
 so
 on
 and
 there
 are
 some


countries
 where
 we
 don't
 invest
 and
 so


uh
 you
 know
 that's
 kind
 of
 the
 broad
 the


broad
 picture
 we
 are
 very
 Diversified
 we


are
 we
 own
 uh
 some
 9,000
 companies
 uh


across
 the
 whole
 world
 in
 Europe
 we
 own


a
 bit
 more
 close
 to
 well
 two
 and
 a
 half


to
 3%
 across
 Europe
 yeah
 yeah
 so
 so
 I


know
 that
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 that


that
 you've
 said
 repeatedly
 is
 you


really
 aim
 to
 be
 the
 most
 transparent


investment
 Fund
 in
 the
 world
 talk
 a


little
 bit
 about
 the
 benefits
 of


transparency
 when
 you're
 running
 an


investment
 pool
 like
 this
 and
 how
 you


think
 about
 you
 know
 transparency
 as
 a


principle
 yeah
 I
 to
 me
 transparency
 is


like
 totally
 key
 uh
 transparency


increases
 trust
 you
 know
 if
 the
 more
 uh


your
 clients
 can
 see
 the
 more
 they
 trust


you
 we
 uh
 disclose
 every
 holding
 we
 have


twice
 a
 year
 um
 and
 we
 are
 the
 most


transparent
 fun
 in
 the
 world
 there's


actually
 a
 world
 championship
 in


transparency
 is
 there
 yeah
 and
 for
 for
 a


period
 of
 time
 didn't
 know
 that
 that's


that's
 the
 sport
 I'm
 doing
 uh
 now
 for
 a


while
 the
 Canadians
 were
 number
 one
 and


I
 thought
 hey
 it's
 fine
 that
 the


Canadians
 beat
 us
 in
 ice
 hockey
 but
 it's


not
 fine
 that
 they
 beat
 us
 in


transparency
 well
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 it's


really
 fine
 that
 they
 beat
 you
 in
 ice


hocky
 W
 but
 so
 so
 last
 year
 for
 the


first
 time
 we
 we
 became
 the
 world


champion
 that's
 awesome
 yeah
 I
 want
 to


talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 climate
 because


I
 know
 it's
 a
 it's
 an
 area
 of
 focus
 for


you
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the
 private


sector
 the
 role
 the
 private
 sector


should
 play
 the
 role
 investors
 play
 when


it
 comes
 to
 the
 environment
 and


sustainability
 do
 you
 do
 you
 see
 how
 do


you
 think
 about
 the
 long-term
 investment


opportunity
 around
 these
 long
 cycle


transition
 issues
 well
 so
 so
 we
 care


about
 climate
 because
 it
 is
 a
 Financial


Risk
 mhm
 we
 see
 it
 now
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 the


commodity
 uh
 prices
 you
 see
 it
 in
 you


know
 coffee
 olive
 oil
 orange
 juice
 all


these
 kind
 of
 things
 where
 you
 know
 the


prices
 are
 going
 up
 because
 Harvest


harvests
 are
 worse
 because
 of
 the


climate
 so
 they
 are
 so
 climate
 and
 the


financial
 Market
 is
 linked
 in
 a


different
 way
 than
 it
 has
 been


before
 um
 so
 we
 spend


a
 lot
 of
 time
 working
 with
 our
 companies


making
 sure
 they
 do
 the
 right
 thing
 on


climate
 I
 appreciate
 there's
 been
 a


backlash
 in
 the
 US
 we
 haven't
 really


seen
 that
 to
 the
 same
 extent
 in
 Europe


and
 for
 sure
 in
 Norway
 we
 continue
 to
 to


have
 the
 same
 opinions
 as
 we've
 had
 uh


before
 I
 think
 there
 are
 investment


opportunities
 in
 that
 space
 as
 well
 now


which
 are
 better
 than
 before
 we
 got
 uh


the
 opportunity
 to
 uh
 invest
 in


renewable
 infrastructure
 four
 years
 ago


and
 in
 the
 beginning
 we
 were
 just
 like


really
 really
 slow
 because
 we
 thought


the
 returns
 were
 too
 low
 too
 many
 people


changing
 the
 deals
 but
 now
 that's


changed
 so
 we
 think
 there
 are
 better


returns
 in
 the
 space
 there's
 a
 bit
 more


supplies
 so
 you
 can
 deploy
 more
 capital


and
 we
 have
 beefed
 up
 the
 team
 and
 and


doing
 more
 than
 that
 in
 renewable


infrastructure
 specifically
 or
 or
 more


broadland
 talk
 a
 little
 your
 your
 five


years
 in
 kind
 of
 frame
 for
 me
 what
 are


what
 are
 a
 handful
 of
 kind
 of
 key


accomplishments
 in
 these
 first
 five


years
 and
 what
 are
 a
 handful
 of
 the
 most


important
 learnings
 yeah
 um


yeah
 so
 first
 of
 all
 it's
 it's
 not
 me


right
 it's
 about
 uh
 uh
 the
 big
 team
 but


what
 have
 we
 focused
 in
 on
 well
 we


focused
 in
 on
 on
 performance
 of
 course


because
 without
 performance
 we
 have
 no


reason
 to
 be
 um
 and
 it's
 very
 much
 about


learning
 from
 mistakes
 it's
 we've


created
 this
 uh
 investment
 simulator


where
 all
 the
 data
 from
 every
 PM
 is
 up


in
 up
 in
 the
 cloud
 and
 when
 you
 want
 to


make
 a
 decision
 you
 get
 it
 all
 fed
 back


to
 you
 all
 your
 weaknesses
 all
 your
 bad


habits
 you
 know
 are
 you
 normally
 uh


selling
 losers
 too
 late
 are
 you
 selling


winners
 too
 early


when
 you
 trade
 you
 basically
 get
 all


these
 signals
 fed
 back
 to
 you
 and
 so


that's
 been
 a
 big
 development
 which
 is


now
 starting
 to
 change
 investment


Behavior
 it's
 really
 cool
 very
 good
 um


we're
 also
 working
 on
 getting
 people
 to


be
 more
 contrarian
 in
 the
 trades
 they
 do


and
 more
 longterm
 you
 know
 the
 most


difficult
 thing
 is
 to
 be
 longterm
 why
 is


it
 so
 difficult
 why
 you
 come
 to
 work
 on


a
 Monday
 and
 it's
 just
 like
 you
 come


home
 and
 you
 tell
 your
 husband
 you
 know


and
 he
 asks
 you
 what
 did
 you
 do
 today


well
 I
 did
 nothing
 you
 know
 Tuesday


nothing
 nothing
 Wednesday
 nothing


Thursday
 nothing
 you
 know
 you
 don't
 feel


great
 about
 it
 and
 so
 sometimes
 the
 best


thing
 is
 not
 to
 do
 very
 much
 but
 it's


very
 profitable
 you
 know
 compounding
 is


just
 amazing
 compounding
 compounding
 is


a
 powerful
 thing
 unb
 that's
 what
 we're


doing
 on
 investment
 side
 on
 the
 people


side
 more
 development
 of
 people
 we
 are


recruiting
 we
 are
 recruiting
 better


people
 on
 the
 communication
 side
 much


more
 transparency
 more
 internal


communication
 more
 external


communication
 and
 then
 operational


robustness
 better
 and
 you
 know
 more


focus
 in
 on
 Cyber
 so
 we
 we
 just
 done
 a


lot
 of


thanks
 you're
 a
 shareholder
 you
 you


mentioned
 9,000
 companies
 I
 know
 Goldman


Sachs
 is
 one
 of
 those
 companies
 we


appreciate
 that
 we
 thank
 you
 for
 all


your
 hard
 work
 we're
 working
 we're


working
 hard
 and
 because
 you
 guys
 are


working
 hard
 we're
 working
 hard
 we're


working
 hard
 what
 um
 talk
 a
 little
 bit


about
 investor
 dialogue
 what
 makes
 for


an
 effective
 investor
 dialogue
 and
 how


important
 is
 investor
 dialogue
 for
 you


with
 respect
 to
 the
 companies
 it's
 very


very
 important
 um
 we
 have
 more
 than


3,000
 meetings
 a
 year
 with
 our
 companies


we
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 turn
 up
 at
 uh
 nearly


10,000
 agms
 we
 vote
 on
 uh
 120,000


proposals
 we
 know
 we
 got
 a
 be
 big


machinery
 uh
 doing
 this
 I
 think
 the
 key


is
 to
 have
 very
 clear
 expectations
 and


so
 we
 have
 this
 set
 up
 in
 uh
 set
 out
 in


expectation
 documents
 it's
 important
 to


be
 consistent
 over
 time
 so
 that
 you
 as
 a


CEO
 know
 that
 we
 are
 not
 like
 changing


our
 mind
 all
 the
 time
 one
 of
 the
 things


I
 found
 very
 interesting
 about
 our


dialogue
 with
 you
 is
 you
 know
 I
 I
 would


say
 you
 know
 your
 team
 when
 they
 deal


with
 us
 they
 are
 deep
 in
 the
 weeds
 Deep


In
 The
 Weeds
 um
 on
 really
 trying
 to


understand
 how
 we're
 thinking
 about


things
 do
 you
 how
 do
 do
 you
 do
 that
 by


industry
 sector
 do
 you
 do
 that
 how
 do


you
 do
 that
 in
 the
 context
 of
 we
 have
 we


have
 industry
 sectors
 we
 got
 some
 really


strong
 sectors
 I
 think
 our
 banking
 team


is
 uh
 is
 really
 superb
 um
 so
 that's
 how


we
 do
 it
 now
 you
 know
 there
 are
 two
 ways


you
 can
 deal
 with
 problems
 as
 a
 as
 an


owner
 you
 can
 just
 you
 can
 sell
 your


holding
 or
 you
 can
 go
 into
 a
 dialogue


now
 what
 what
 kind
 of
 problem
 do
 you


solve
 by
 selling
 your
 holding
 nothing


you
 know
 let's
 say
 now
 you
 have
 a


company
 which
 is
 doing
 you
 know
 not
 so


good
 stuff
 on
 climate
 you
 sell
 everybody


sells
 the
 holding
 what
 happens
 well
 you


the
 company
 ends
 up
 in
 the
 hands
 of


people
 who
 don't
 care
 you
 know
 so
 it's


just
 not
 good
 it's
 better
 to
 hold
 it
 and


to
 talk
 and
 to
 Advocate
 and
 to
 engage


it's
 like
 when
 you
 feel
 like
 when
 you


have
 a
 problem
 at
 home
 you
 can
 just
 is


kind
 of
 sold
 off
 or
 you
 can
 try
 to
 fix


it
 that's
 the
 try
 to
 fix
 it
 is
 a
 better


strategy
 often
 yeah
 listen
 and


understand
 first
 yeah
 yeah
 so
 in
 the


first
 half
 of
 2024
 your
 fund
 post
 posted


$138
 billion
 in
 profit
 largely
 and
 kind


of
 the
 acceleration
 of
 large
 cap
 Tech


talk
 a
 little
 bit
 let's
 talk
 a
 little


bit
 about
 AI
 yeah
 kind
 of
 the
 future
 of


AI
 investment
 what
 what
 are
 some
 of
 the


risks
 of
 concentration
 in
 the
 market
 I


mean
 at
 the
 moment
 you
 know
 when
 you
 you


look
 at
 kind
 of
 the
 large
 cap
 indexes


and
 what's
 going
 on
 you
 have
 enormous


concentration
 and
 if
 you're
 not
 you
 know


overweighted
 to
 this
 handful
 of
 stocks


you're
 going
 to
 unperformed
 talk
 a


little
 bit
 about
 how
 you
 thinking
 about


yeah
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 level
 of


concentration
 we've
 never
 seen
 before


right
 M
 uh
 as
 you
 know
 hugely


concentrated
 in
 very
 few
 names
 the
 big


problem
 here
 in
 my
 mind
 is
 that
 they
 are


all
 linked
 into
 the
 same
 geopolitical


risk
 and
 so
 we
 have
 not
 seen


before
 one
 the
 concentration
 we
 seen
 two


the
 link
 with
 geopolitical
 risk
 and


that's
 just
 very
 risky
 and
 so
 I
 think


the
 risk
 in
 the
 public
 market
 is
 um


probably
 higher
 than
 in
 the
 private


market
 now
 yeah
 yeah
 and
 in
 the
 past
 you


know
 we
 looked
 at
 kind
 of
 risks
 well
 uh


Public
 Market
 not
 risky
 private
 Market


very
 risky
 I
 think
 perhaps
 it's
 changed


so
 talk
 since
 you
 raised
 the
 private


Market
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 kind
 of


you
 know
 private
 Market
 talk
 a
 little


bit
 about
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 know


obviously
 in
 public
 markets
 we
 have
 a


narrowing
 of
 lised
 companies
 um
 we
 also


I
 think
 you
 know
 given
 the
 burden
 of


operating
 you
 know
 as
 a
 public
 company


um
 you
 know
 we
 have
 people
 waiting


longer
 um
 to
 take
 markets
 you
 know
 take


companies
 to
 the
 public
 market
 there's


more
 availability
 of
 capital
 in
 a


private
 form
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 the


private
 the
 private
 markets
 how
 do
 you


think
 about
 the
 growth
 of
 private


Capital
 um
 where
 do
 you
 think
 we
 are
 you


know
 more
 secular
 growth
 well
 I
 think


it's
 very
 interesting
 you
 know
 you
 now


have
 supposedly
 the
 number
 of
 listed


companies
 in
 the
 US
 has
 gone
 from
 8,000


to
 4,000
 you're
 seeing
 the
 same


development
 in
 Europe
 using
 it
 pretty


much
 all
 over
 the
 place
 private
 Market


companies
 stay
 private
 for
 longer
 they


get
 bigger
 uh
 and
 so
 on
 so
 um
 I
 mean


unfortunately
 it's
 a
 space
 where
 we
 are


not
 operating
 yeah
 so
 it's
 not
 in
 our


mandate
 to
 be
 in
 the
 private
 market
 and


but
 there
 is
 a
 political
 process
 so
 so


it
 may
 change
 but
 not
 for


now
 um
 you
 know
 I
 think
 ideally
 one


should
 be
 in
 in
 both
 6%
 annual


returns
 that
 of
 steadiness
 that


reliability
 has
 earned
 enormous
 trust


from
 the
 people
 of


Norway
 um
 some
 critics
 probably
 say
 you


can
 perform
 at
 a
 higher
 rate
 yeah
 how
 do


you
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 that
 how
 do


you
 how
 do
 you
 view
 because
 there's
 no


question
 you
 know
 risk
 reward
 has
 to
 be


balanced
 when
 you
 think
 about
 long-term


returns
 how
 do
 you
 kind
 of
 Benchmark
 how


do
 you
 think
 about
 that
 yeah
 again
 um


coming
 back
 to
 this
 uh
 mandate
 that
 we


have
 for
 the
 ministry
 which
 in
 Broad


terms
 you
 know
 lay
 out
 how
 we
 should
 be


invested
 we
 have
 we
 have
 roughly
 70
 %
 in


equities
 30%
 in
 bonds
 we
 have
 uh
 a
 real


estate
 portfolio
 where
 we
 got
 like


thousand
 properties
 around
 the
 world
 we


got
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 ownership
 on
 you
 know


air
 on
 Manhattan
 as
 well
 um
 so
 um
 it
 the


returns
 could
 have
 been
 higher


historically
 had
 we
 been
 in
 private


markets
 but
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 are


not
 um
 you
 know
 we
 have
 compounded


between
 6
 and
 7%
 for
 the
 last
 28
 years


and
 um
 and
 that's
 been
 good
 so
 so
 you


look
 at
 the
 value
 of
 the
 fund
 now


onethird
 of
 the
 fund
 is
 uh
 the
 value
 of


money
 that
 the
 government
 has
 put
 in
 and


2/3
 is
 returns
 yeah
 so
 it's
 quite
 it's


quite
 amazing
 in
 a
 way
 we
 found
 oil


twice
 one
 on
 the
 Norwegian
 shelf
 y


second
 time
 in
 financial
 markets
 yeah


when
 you
 think
 about


um
 kind
 of
 risk
 reward
 you
 know
 over
 a


long
 period
 of
 time
 and
 you
 think
 about


compounding
 you
 know
 in
 particular
 when


you
 own
 a
 great
 asset
 will
 you
 own
 it


forever
 do
 you
 feel
 like
 if
 you
 really


had
 an
 incredible
 asset
 you
 say
 we're


going
 to
 own
 this
 for
 50
 years
 uh


personally
 yes
 mhm
 that's
 the
 way
 I


would
 construct
 the
 portfolio
 now
 when


you
 have
 portfolio
 managers
 who
 are


incentivized
 on
 a
 let's
 say
 three-year


rolling
 basis
 it's
 difficult
 to
 get


people
 not
 to
 trade
 very
 much
 and
 so
 we


try
 to
 extend
 the
 time
 Horizon
 on
 this


um
 we
 are
 probably
 going
 to
 put
 in
 a
 a


fiveyear
 element
 in
 the


comp
 um
 which
 I
 think
 you
 need
 to
 do
 to


get
 people
 to
 kind
 of
 take
 a
 longer
 view


a
 longterm
 view
 because
 you
 take
 a


longer
 term
 view
 um
 you
 make
 fewer


decisions
 the
 fewer
 decisions
 you
 make


the
 better
 that
 tend
 to
 be
 you
 know
 if


you
 make
 one
 decision
 a
 month
 it
 tends


to
 be
 better
 and
 if
 you
 make
 10
 a
 day


right
 sure
 you
 save
 of
 course
 uh
 I
 mean


of
 course
 you
 you
 would
 hate
 to
 hear


this
 but
 you
 save
 trading


commission
 and
 so
 I
 don't
 really
 hate
 to


hear
 it
 because
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 think


it's
 fundamentally
 right
 I
 you
 know
 I


love
 the
 fact
 though
 that
 there
 are
 so


many
 incentive
 schemes
 that
 actually


force
 people
 to
 create
 velocity
 around


Capital
 but
 I
 you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 things


it's
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I've
 never
 really


understood
 is
 when
 you
 think
 about
 the


way
 the
 whole
 private
 Capital
 Market
 is


structured
 it's
 actually
 structured
 to


create
 velocity
 of
 capital
 and
 you
 know


I
 think
 you
 know
 I
 think
 most
 Pension


funds
 just
 to
 take
 a
 broad
 example
 not


specific
 to
 you
 at
 all
 but
 most
 Pension


funds
 you
 know
 have
 much
 much
 longer
 dat


of
 liabilities
 and
 so
 you
 know
 why
 if


you're
 allocating
 your
 money
 to
 a


private
 Equity
 manager
 just
 to
 pick
 one


you
 know
 one
 form
 of
 private
 Capital
 why


would
 you
 rather
 that
 they
 own
 something


for
 four
 or
 five
 years
 and
 have
 an


incentive
 system
 create
 velocity
 around


it
 instead
 of
 to
 try
 to
 find
 they
 own
 a


great
 company
 that
 can
 compound
 at
 8
 to


10%
 okay
 you
 want
 them
 to
 own
 it
 for
 30


years
 or
 40
 years
 but
 there's
 very


little
 the
 whole
 financial
 Market


incentive
 system
 is
 not
 set
 up
 to
 do


that
 absolutely
 but
 everything
 is
 moving


faster
 you
 know
 there's
 more
 frequent


trading
 sure
 um
 you
 know
 uh
 you'd
 be


surprised
 to
 hear
 but
 over
 the
 last
 30


years
 people
 talk
 and
 walk
 10%
 faster
 so


you
 measure
 average
 speed
 of
 walking
 in


a
 city
 and
 um
 you
 know
 compared
 to
 30


years
 ago
 you
 are
 10%
 faster
 I
 mean
 not


you
 but
 I've
 always
 been
 a
 fast
 Walker


you've
 always
 been
 fast
 I
 think
 I
 I


think
 IED
 just
 as
 fast
 now
 as
 I
 did
 30


years
 ago
 yeah
 I'm
 I'm
 wondering
 whether


the
 companies
 Sho
 I
 might
 talk
 a
 little


bit
 slower
 now
 because
 unfortunately
 now


people
 are
 listening
 to
 everything
 I
 say


so
 I've
 got
 to
 talk
 slower
 but
 but
 um


but
 but
 the
 walking
 things
 into
 people


people
 there's
 certainly
 an
 intensity


yeah
 especially
 around
 markets
 there's


an
 intensity
 that
 didn't
 exist
 34
 yeah


it's
 it's
 Market
 it's
 all
 you
 know
 we


always
 on
 uh
 you
 know
 mobile
 phones


uh
 uh
 it's
 247
 more
 activ
 yeah
 247
 for


sure
 let's
 let's
 shift
 gears
 you


launched
 this
 terrific
 podcast
 in
 Good


Company
 in
 2022
 all
 about
 leadership
 um


I
 was
 Lu
 the
 second
 guest
 was
 you
 I
 was


the
 second
 guest
 I
 was
 say
 I
 was
 lucky


to
 be
 a
 guest
 thank
 you
 for
 making
 me


the
 second
 guest
 I
 didn't
 realize
 I
 was


the
 second
 guest
 who
 was
 the
 first
 guest


uh
 was
 the
 CEO
 BP
 oh
 but
 when
 you
 came


on
 you
 know
 it
 was
 really
 cool
 because


you
 know
 you
 started
 saying
 it
 was
 a


pilot
 I
 didn't
 know
 whether
 it
 was
 good


fly
 or
 not
 and
 uh
 and
 bang
 you
 get
 the


SEO
 of
 Goldman
 Sachs
 wow
 big
 deal
 you


know
 so
 then
 we
 thought
 hey
 this
 could


perhaps
 be
 a
 serious
 thing
 and
 now
 it's


the
 biggest
 now
 is
 one
 of
 the
 leading


business
 podast
 in
 the
 world
 you
 know


one
 of
 them
 and
 uh
 uh
 yeah
 it's
 it's
 fun


no
 it's
 a
 big
 podcast
 but
 I
 mean
 think


about
 this
 okay
 have
 anybody
 listen
 to


any
 anybody
 listen
 anybody
 heard
 the


podcast
 yeah
 the
 the
 CEO
 what's
 what's


wrong
 with
 the
 rest
 of


you
 start
 listening
 to
 the
 podcast
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 largest
 Sovereign
 wealth
 fund


and
 a
 significant
 shareholder
 in
 Goldman


Sachs
 calls
 and
 says
 hey
 will
 you
 go
 on


my
 podcast
 let
 me
 think
 about
 it
 okay
 I


me
 that
 was
 not
 that
 was
 not
 a
 tough
 ask


it
 was
 you
 I
 was
 really
 impressed


because
 you
 responded
 within
 five


minutes
 okay
 well
 I
 I
 try
 to
 be
 very


very
 responsive
 but
 let's
 let's
 talk


about
 the
 the
 podcast
 yeah
 you've


interviewed
 dozens
 of
 CEOs
 at
 this
 point


dozens
 of
 CEOs
 yeah
 what
 similarities
 do


you


see
 yeah
 it's
 uh
 very
 interesting


because
 when
 you
 kind
 of
 cut
 them
 up


into
 pieces
 and
 throw
 them
 up
 in
 the
 air


and
 see
 where
 they
 land
 it's
 uh
 CEOs


have
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 similarities
 right
 um


there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 focus
 on
 uh
 on
 grit


there
 is
 generally
 high
 level
 of
 energy


I
 would
 say
 curiosity
 is
 very
 high
 up
 on


the
 list
 so
 um
 yeah
 they
 have
 quite
 a


little
 things
 in


common
 is
 good
 leadership
 changing
 and


evolving
 I
 think
 it
 is
 I
 think
 it
 is
 I


think
 there
 is
 um
 more
 focus
 in
 on


listening
 skills


there
 is
 more
 on


empathy
 um
 there
 is
 more
 on
 generally


involving
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 people
 you


work
 with
 in
 strategy
 development
 and
 so


on
 and
 I
 think
 it
 makes
 it
 easier
 to


actually


execute
 and
 I
 also
 think
 the
 empathy


element
 uh
 I
 think
 is
 more
 important


than
 ever
 before
 in
 a
 time
 of
 AI
 that
 we


lean
 on
 what
 it
 is
 that
 makes
 us
 human


and
 then
 I
 think
 there
 is
 a
 really


interesting
 thing
 with
 the
 Indian


leaders
 you
 know
 people
 with
 Indian


backgrounds
 because
 they
 kind
 of
 broke


through
 the
 glass
 ceiling
 and
 taken
 over


the
 whole
 you
 know
 Silicon
 Valley
 right


so
 what
 what
 what
 is
 it
 that
 they
 bring


well
 I
 think
 they
 are
 more
 uh
 in
 the


know
 in
 what
 they're


doing
 um
 there
 is
 something
 that
 the


firm
 is
 bigger
 than
 themselves
 uh
 there


is
 a
 lot
 of
 focus
 on
 empathy
 you
 know


such
 as
 sa
 Adella
 who
 talks
 about
 a
 huge


empathetic
 very
 big
 on
 that
 um
 and
 that


there
 is
 no
 uh
 there
 is
 no
 uh
 trade-off


between
 empathy
 and
 execution
 you
 know


it
 goes
 hand
 in
 hand
 so
 I
 I
 I
 think


leadership
 is


moving
 are
 there
 differences
 in


regions
 uh
 yes
 you
 know
 I
 suspect
 uh
 us


leaders
 are
 bit
 more
 extrovert
 uh
 uh


probably
 take
 a
 bit
 more
 risks
 than
 we


do
 in
 Europe
 um
 Scandinavian
 is
 you


think
 that's
 a
 positive
 well
 I
 actually


think
 it's
 yes
 it
 is
 a
 positive
 and
 it


explains
 part
 of
 why
 we
 have
 a
 bit
 of
 a


problem
 in
 Europe
 uh
 we
 don't
 take


enough
 risks
 you
 know
 there
 is
 is


combined
 with
 regulation
 and
 so
 on
 but


the
 risk
 appetite
 and
 the
 level
 of


ambition
 in
 America
 is
 really
 driving


growth
 yeah
 the
 Innovation
 economy
 here


and
 the
 willingness
 of
 people
 to
 start


businesses
 take
 risk
 innovate
 Drive


growth
 is
 definitely
 contributing
 to


kind
 of
 US
 economic
 yeah
 absolutely
 but


also
 also
 the


absolutely
 and
 so
 so
 that's
 a
 bit
 of
 a


cultural
 difference
 yeah
 when
 you
 look


at
 these
 Leadership
 Lessons
 you
 know
 as


you
 talk
 to
 different
 leaders
 do
 you


find
 yourself
 incorporating
 it
 somehow


into
 the
 way
 you
 run
 the
 fund
 totally


can
 you
 give
 a
 concrete
 example
 I
 tried


to
 trying
 to
 integrate
 all
 the
 good


stuff
 I
 learned
 it's
 really
 really
 uh


interesting
 right
 I
 I
 mean
 we
 we
 try
 to


steal
 everywhere
 we
 can
 talk
 about
 some


I
 mean
 not
 money
 but
 I
 mean
 ideas
 by
 the


way
 you
 know
 imitation
 is
 the
 highest


form
 of
 FL
 absolutely
 totally
 talk
 talk


about
 some
 of
 your
 favorite
 guests
 what


characteristics
 do
 they
 share
 As
 Leaders


uh
 well
 I
 think
 uh
 I
 mean
 in
 addition
 to


you
 of
 course
 yeah
 put
 me


aside
 um
 no
 I
 think
 you
 can
 put
 them


into
 different
 categories
 of
 course


speaking
 to
 the
 tech
 leaders
 is
 amazing


right
 so
 you
 speak
 to
 Sam
 Olman
 yanson


hang
 Bill
 Gates
 and
 so
 on
 and
 and
 they


they
 basically
 look
 into
 the
 future
 you


know
 um
 they
 see
 what
 it
 looks
 like
 and


they
 and
 and
 you
 learn
 that
 I
 think
 some


of
 the
 people
 who
 are
 from
 different


different
 places
 than
 actually
 Finance


is
 quite
 fun
 right
 we
 did
 Magnus
 Carlson


the
 best
 chess
 player
 in
 the
 world


comparing
 chess
 strategy
 with
 investment


strategy
 which
 like
 wow
 you
 know
 when
 do


you
 take
 risks
 do
 you
 take
 more
 risks


after
 you
 lost
 or
 or
 do
 you
 take
 less


risk
 you
 know
 very
 oppos
 very
 different


from
 what
 what
 we
 typically
 do
 so
 just
 a


lot
 of
 uh
 learnings
 from
 that
 um


stoltenberg
 the
 NATO
 Secretary
 General


on
 geopolitics
 and
 so
 on
 and
 then
 um


some
 of
 the
 real
 long-term
 thinkers
 like


the
 walberg's
 in
 Sweden
 really


interesting
 I
 would
 say
 it's
 perhaps
 the


one
 thing
 that
 characterizes
 great


investors
 it's
 uh
 conviction
 and
 the


ability
 to
 be
 contrarian
 and
 not
 think


about
 what
 other
 people
 think
 and
 then


be
 able
 to
 change
 and
 the
 combination


stubborn
 and
 be
 able
 to
 change
 your
 mind


really
 really
 rare
 that's
 a
 great
 great


way
 to
 frame
 it
 what
 advice
 can
 you


share
 about
 steps
 leaders
 should


prioritize
 when
 they
 take
 a
 new
 job
 to


lead
 an
 organization
 I
 understand
 when


you
 took
 this
 job
 you
 actually
 kind
 of


had
 a
 road
 map
 or
 a
 list
 of
 priorities


that
 you
 wanted
 to
 follow
 you
 have
 do


you
 have
 advice
 around
 that
 yeah
 it
 was


great
 so
 I
 got
 this
 job


uh
 I
 rang
 the
 best
 C
 I've
 ever
 met
 and
 I


said
 hey
 I
 got
 this
 new
 job
 what
 should


I
 do
 like
 well
 what
 you
 should
 do
 that's


easy
 you
 first
 have
 to
 talk
 to
 a
 lot
 of


people
 in
 The
 Firm
 do
 it
 before
 you


start
 your
 job
 then
 you
 show
 respect
 uh


they
 need
 need
 to
 get
 to
 know
 you
 and


you
 need
 to
 get
 to
 know
 them
 you
 get


more
 data
 points
 so
 you
 make
 better


decisions
 they
 feel
 included
 they
 feel


heard
 so
 that
 when
 you
 CH
 make
 changes


they
 will
 be
 with


you
 then
 you
 put
 together
 a
 leader
 group


you
 do
 not
 hire
 people
 from
 the
 outside


during
 your
 first
 year
 you
 define
 you


define
 your
 DNA
 of
 the
 firm
 and
 you
 show


everybody
 else
 in
 the
 firm
 that
 you


respect
 what
 they
 do
 and
 then
 you
 make


changes
 as
 a
 combined
 leadership
 group


you
 mustn't
 do
 it
 on
 your
 own
 because


you
 can
 trigger
 what
 is
 called
 the
 kind


of
 the
 corporate
 immune
 system
 where


basically
 they
 squeeze
 you
 out
 so
 you
 do


it
 as
 a
 combined
 group
 and
 then
 you
 pick


a
 few
 things
 not
 too
 many
 and
 don't
 do


them
 don't
 make
 them
 the
 changes
 too


fast
 the
 people
 who
 fail
 other
 the


people
 who
 try
 to
 do
 too
 much
 too
 fast


yeah
 and
 so
 we
 we
 made
 changes
 and
 I


think
 twice
 we
 felt
 that
 we
 were
 moving


a
 bit
 too
 fast
 and
 we
 slow


down
 but
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 way
 to
 do
 it


you
 you
 mentioned
 Grit
 tole
 i'
 I've
 I've


always
 thought
 the
 grit
 is
 a
 you
 know


not
 just
 for
 leadership
 but
 kind
 of
 for


success
 in
 life
 in
 business
 you
 know
 the


grit
 is
 a
 hugely
 hugely
 you
 know


valuable
 personal
 characteristic
 talk
 a


little
 bit
 about
 how
 you
 think
 about


grit
 and
 how
 it
 how
 it
 plays
 a
 role
 as


people
 approach
 challenges
 ah
 it's
 it's


totally
 key
 it's
 just
 how
 you
 cope
 with


things
 right
 I
 think
 you
 can
 it's
 it's


sometimes
 difficult
 to
 screen
 for
 it
 but


you
 when
 you
 hire
 you
 see
 what
 people


have
 been
 doing
 so
 I
 was
 interviewing


this
 guy
 for
 uh
 for
 a
 summer
 program
 he


like
 hey
 what
 are
 you
 um
 what
 have
 you


done
 during
 your
 Summers
 I
 worked
 in
 a


bakery
 okay
 but
 I'm


mean
 uh
 seven
 summers
 in
 a
 row
 yeah
 I


mean
 do
 you
 know
 when
 you
 need
 to
 wake


up
 to
 work
 in
 a
 bakery
 it's
 like
 3:
 in


the
 morning
 super
 early
 super
 early
 so


we
 try
 to
 find
 it
 and
 I
 think
 you
 know


we
 are
 in
 a
 world
 where
 there
 is
 perhaps


a
 bit
 less
 grit
 than
 before
 um
 the


younger
 generation
 have
 uh
 on
 average


according
 to
 the
 Specialists
 a
 bit
 less


great
 because
 they've
 been
 protected
 by


the
 parents
 you
 know
 parents
 are
 taking


all
 the
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 decisions


and
 the
 problems
 and
 so
 therefore
 we


have
 had
 less
 um
 problems
 to
 cope
 with


you
 think
 that's
 you
 think
 that's
 you


think
 that's
 permanent
 or
 you
 think


that's


cyclical
 well
 so
 that's
 interesting
 U


but
 I
 do
 think
 it
 also
 it
 explains
 some


of
 the
 you
 know
 it's
 not
 easy
 to
 be


young
 these
 days
 and
 it
 could
 be
 that


you
 just
 have
 had
 too
 much
 protection
 I


think
 it's
 cyclical
 because
 I
 think
 the


next
 generation
 is
 just
 like
 hey
 you


know
 what
 my
 parents
 kind
 of
 screwed
 me


up
 I'm
 certainly
 not
 going
 to
 do
 the


same
 mistake
 and
 so
 I
 think
 he's
 going


to
 get
 you
 know
 into
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff


in
 other
 words
 my
 parents
 didn't
 get
 a


hoot
 what
 I
 was
 doing
 you
 know
 I
 mean


they
 basically
 said
 come
 home
 when
 the


street
 lights
 go
 on
 absolutely
 okay
 that


certainly
 wasn't
 the
 way
 my
 kids
 grow
 up


yeah
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 my
 I
 remember
 my


father
 he
 said
 uh
 Nikolai
 have
 you
 heard


about
 the
 hedge
 fund
 he
 like
 Daddy
 I've


been
 I
 worked
 for
 hedg
 for
 10
 years


now
 shift
 gears
 you're
 passionate
 about


European
 competitiveness
 and
 it
 was


interesting
 what
 you
 said
 a
 few
 moments


ago
 when
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 you
 know


innovation


and
 and
 regulation
 I
 mean
 I
 just
 I
 I


would
 just
 observe
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 that
 you
 know
 I
 saw
 you
 know


recently
 that
 just
 kind
 of
 I
 I
 I
 thought


you
 know
 the
 European
 Union
 got
 so
 wrong


was
 when
 the
 regulatory
 infrastructure


came
 out
 and
 said
 we
 have
 to
 protect


Europe
 from
 AI
 it's
 almost
 like
 the


opposite
 how
 do
 we
 encourage
 Europe
 to


be
 taking
 risks
 and
 investing
 in
 in
 AI


talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 what
 Europe
 can


do
 to
 be
 more
 competitive
 yeah
 it's
 a


very
 very
 difficult
 question
 right
 um


I
 mean
 on
 AI
 we
 think
 it
 needs
 some
 kind


of
 Regulation
 and
 oversight
 but
 the


thing
 is
 that
 in
 Europe
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of


Regulation
 and
 in
 my
 mind
 regulations


are
 one
 one
 one
 by
 one
 they're
 pretty


good
 right
 there's
 a
 reason
 why
 you


regulate
 that
 and
 why
 you
 regulate
 that


and
 why
 you
 regulate
 that
 but
 it's
 a
 bit


like
 you
 come
 into
 a
 bar
 and
 each
 bottle


tastes
 pretty
 good
 but
 when
 you
 put


everything
 into
 a
 bucket
 it
 doesn't


taste
 so
 good
 Long
 Island
 Ice
 te
 yeah


well
 that's
 only
 like
 six
 six
 it's
 only


six
 yeah
 or
 whatever


uh
 so
 it's
 very


regulated
 and
 um
 and
 I
 think
 that
 the


kind
 of
 the
 heavy
 level
 of
 Regulation


combined
 with
 uh
 kind
 of
 competition


Authority
 which
 has
 insisted
 that
 there


should
 be
 huge
 competition
 in
 all
 areas


in
 all
 countries
 means
 that
 you
 have
 a


pretty
 fragmented
 market
 right
 there
 is


not
 one
 big


Bank
 uh
 in
 every
 country
 you
 have
 three


Telecom
 operators
 so
 you
 basically
 have


nearly
 30
 in
 the
 whole
 of
 Europe
 whil


three
 in
 the
 whole
 of
 the
 us
 so
 you
 get


uh
 quite
 small
 players
 in
 a
 lot
 of


different
 places
 and
 that
 means
 that


they
 are
 not
 globally
 competitive
 now


this
 may
 be
 changing
 uh
 hopefully
 and
 I


think
 it
 does
 but
 you
 know
 there
 is
 a


lot
 of
 stuff
 to
 do
 and
 if
 you
 want
 to


read
 a
 good
 report
 on
 this
 it's
 a
 druggy


report
 which
 came
 out
 a
 little
 while


back
 really
 report
 it's
 just
 the
 kind
 of


things
 we
 need
 to
 do
 now
 what
 you
 need


to
 do
 takes
 it
 costs
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 and


it
 takes
 strong
 political
 will
 and
 so


we'll
 see
 what
 happens
 leadership
 takes


leadership
 takes
 leadership
 yeah
 it's
 is


not
 easy
 yeah
 yeah
 so
 to
 live
 in
 Europe


and
 in
 in
 America
 uh
 is
 pretty
 good
 yeah


I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 Europe
 is
 a
 great


place
 to
 live
 it's
 a
 fantastic
 place
 to


live
 yeah
 and
 you
 know
 there
 are
 some


really
 serious
 questions
 about
 kind
 of


social
 Fabric
 and
 and
 those
 kind
 of


things
 right
 and
 uh
 and
 social


protection
 um
 and
 for
 sure
 we
 have
 that


in
 Europe


yeah
 I
 mean
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I've


found
 fascinating
 is
 I've
 gotten
 to
 know


you
 over
 the
 last
 you
 know
 five
 six


years
 is
 you
 love
 to
 learn
 you
 have
 lots


of
 diverse
 interests
 you
 know
 outside
 of


Finance
 including
 degrees
 you've


completed
 as
 an
 adult
 in
 art
 history
 and


Social


Psychology
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about


getting
 those
 degrees
 as
 an
 adult
 and


how
 it's
 affected
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 the


way
 you
 invest
 how
 it's
 affected
 kind
 of


your
 thought
 process
 around
 life
 yeah
 so


it
 depends
 on
 you
 know
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do


you
 measure
 your
 life
 some
 people


measure
 their
 success
 in
 in
 money
 I


don't
 do
 that
 I
 think
 you
 know
 some


people
 think
 the
 people
 who's
 got
 the


most
 money
 when
 he
 or
 she
 dies
 is
 has


won
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 totally
 wrong
 I


think
 think
 they
 have
 lost
 because
 first


of
 all
 they
 should
 have
 given
 it
 away


right
 but
 I
 think
 the
 person
 who
 knows


the
 most
 when
 he
 or
 she
 dies
 they
 are


the
 winners
 so
 you
 need
 to
 learn
 as
 much


as
 you


can
 and
 so
 you
 know
 I
 tried
 to
 learn
 all


the
 time
 so
 um
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 the
 one
 of


the
 most
 interesting
 thing
 I've
 studied


is
 uh
 social
 psychology
 because
 there
 it


kind
 of
 teaches
 you
 how
 people
 think


what
 kind
 of
 risk
 they
 take
 what
 what


are
 the
 drivers
 in
 their
 lives
 and
 so
 on


and
 we've
 put
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 into


work
 in
 the
 fund
 uh
 it's
 the
 whole
 idea


behind
 the
 uh
 the
 investment
 simulator


it's
 just
 how
 you
 can
 learn
 and
 how
 you


know
 what
 are
 your
 weaknesses
 as
 a


Trader
 and
 so
 on
 that
 comes
 from
 that


how
 you
 use
 your
 analysis
 versus
 gut


feel
 or
 pattern
 recognition
 that's


interesting
 you
 know
 how
 you
 cope
 with


being
 contrarian
 all
 these
 kind
 of


things
 so
 um
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 very


interesting
 how
 you
 can
 combine
 things


with
 finance
 and
 most
 of
 the
 Innovations


these
 days
 come
 from
 how
 you
 combine
 uh


you
 know
 information
 in
 new
 ways
 I
 think


it's
 really


fascinating
 you
 know
 you're
 touching
 a


little
 bit
 on
 culture
 culture
 is
 hugely


important
 success
 I
 read
 an
 article
 by
 a


Norwegian
 author
 who
 praised
 your
 form


of
 leadership
 saying
 I
 quote
 you
 embody


the
 image
 of
 a
 modern


Viking
 always
 in
 motion
 constantly


active
 busy
 they
 were
 Keen
 uh
 to
 explore


yeah
 um
 they
 supposedly
 they
 were
 very


consensus
 driven
 MH
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 how


they
 did
 that
 like
 hey
 which
 Village
 are


we
 going
 to
 pillage
 uh
 let's
 vote
 for
 it


uh
 but
 um
 but
 supposedly
 and
 it
 explains


why
 why
 leadership
 form
 in
 the
 noric


countries
 is
 more
 consensual
 uh


supposedly
 somebody
 told
 me
 yeah
 um
 no
 I


think
 you
 want
 you
 be
 curious
 I
 think


you
 want
 to
 move
 around
 I
 think
 you
 want


to
 do
 different
 things
 you
 know
 it's


important
 not
 to
 be
 not
 to
 have
 too


strong
 habits
 it's
 important
 to
 break


them
 up
 so
 for
 instance
 you
 know
 do
 you


know
 when
 during
 the
 holiday
 you
 are
 the


most


happy
 after
 it's
 over
 no
 uh
 the
 the
 the


43rd


hour
 that's
 after
 which
 you
 start
 to
 get


uh
 uh
 habituated
 with
 where
 you
 are
 as


you
 come
 to
 these
 nice
 places
 really


sunny
 it's
 wonderful
 wow
 Blue
 Water


right
 that
 is
 just
 like
 amazing
 for
 the


first
 43
 hours
 and
 then
 it
 starts
 to


become


habit
 and
 so
 you
 need
 to
 break
 it
 up
 you


need
 to
 do
 some
 more
 things
 so
 for


instance
 I
 live
 in
 uh
 in
 New
 York
 now


for
 the
 whole
 of
 November
 it's
 fantastic


fantastic
 I
 just
 you
 know
 times
 have


never
 been
 more
 exciting
 I
 wake
 up
 in


the
 morning
 I
 just
 cannot
 way
 to
 get
 out


of
 bed
 and
 uh
 it's
 just
 never
 been
 more


exciting
 and
 let's
 not
 forget
 that
 this


is
 the
 world
 we
 live
 in
 right
 we
 have
 uh


technology
 change
 has
 never
 been
 faster


geopolitics
 never
 more
 exciting
 hey
 us


election
 coming
 up
 really
 exciting
 too


Nikolai
 thank
 you
 this
 has
 been
 terrific


really
 appreciate
 you
 taking
 the
 time
 to


do
 it
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 that
 was
 great


really
 appreciate
 you
 doing
 it
