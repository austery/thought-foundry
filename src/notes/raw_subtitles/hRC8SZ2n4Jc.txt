[Music]


hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangin
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 so
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today


we
 are
 thrilled
 to
 be
 joined
 by
 Aden


fredman
 CEO
 of


nastac
 now
 Adina
 transformed
 NASDAQ
 into


a
 Global
 Tech
 Powerhouse
 and
 she's
 now


one
 of
 the
 most
 influential
 leaders
 in


global
 Finance
 so
 ad
 welcome
 well
 it's


great
 to
 be
 here
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 n
 and


welcome
 to
 NASDAQ
 well
 exactly
 because


I'm
 visiting
 you
 so
 I'm
 sitting
 here


with
 a
 NASDAQ
 mug
 you
 know
 I'm
 feeling


uh
 kind
 of
 part
 of
 something
 pretty


pretty
 big
 but
 um
 we
 you
 start
 with
 the


basic
 here
 so
 what
 is
 NASDAQ
 sure
 well


nasac
 of
 course
 is
 a
 world-class
 Market


operator
 and
 we're
 extremely
 extremely


proud
 of
 that
 Foundation
 yeah
 but
 as
 you


know
 we
 have
 expanded
 our
 business
 to


become
 a
 global
 technology
 provider
 to


the
 financial
 industry
 and
 we
 focused
 on


expanding
 our
 business
 in
 three
 key


pillars
 and
 they
 all
 are
 kind
 of
 form


the
 foundation
 of
 a
 good
 market
 so
 we've


got
 our
 liquidity
 pillar
 transparency


and
 integrity
 and
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it


you
 need
 all
 three
 of
 those
 things
 to


make
 for
 a
 worldclass
 capital
 Market
 but


as
 we've
 kind
 of
 become
 a
 technology


provider
 and
 partner
 to
 our
 clients


we've
 used
 those
 themes
 to
 really
 expand


our
 business
 on
 the
 cup
 I
 had
 here
 um
 it


says
 NASDAQ
 rewrite
 tomorrow
 so
 what
 is


tomorrow
 going
 to
 look
 like
 for
 Nasdaq


well
 tomorrow
 it
 we
 are
 now
 we're
 going


from
 a
 market
 operator
 to
 a
 technology


partner
 and
 over
 time
 we
 want
 to
 become


kind
 of
 what
 I
 would
 call
 an
 ecosystem


partner
 to
 the
 world's
 Capital
 markets


and
 the
 financial
 system
 so
 our
 vision


is
 to
 be
 the
 trusted
 fabric
 to
 the


world's
 Financial
 system
 and
 that
 really


does
 mean
 that
 we
 are
 not
 only
 here
 just


to
 be
 a
 software
 provider
 to
 our
 clients


but
 to
 help
 them
 solve
 their
 problems
 in


a
 more
 material
 ways
 how
 do
 we
 drive


from
 delivering
 software
 to
 delivering
 a


a
 market
 ecosystem
 that
 makes
 the


capital
 markets
 around
 the
 world
 more


efficient
 and
 effective
 how
 do
 we
 come


become
 that
 risk
 management
 partner
 that


really
 drives
 the
 banks
 to
 be
 higher


Integrity
 as
 well
 as
 more
 efficient
 so


they
 can
 drive
 more
 liquidity
 into
 the


markets
 those
 are
 the
 types
 of
 things


that
 we
 think
 about
 as
 we
 expand
 the


business
 you
 say
 that
 you
 wanted
 to
 be
 a


trusted
 partner
 and
 you
 for
 sure
 are


trusted
 by
 some
 very
 big
 companies
 right


because
 is
 the
 five
 biggest
 companies
 in


the
 world
 are
 listed
 on
 NQ
 the
 seven
 but


yeah
 the
 seven
 hey
 so
 you
 know
 you
 want


to
 buy
 shares
 in
 apple
 Microsoft
 Amazon


alphabet
 you
 basically
 do
 it
 on
 ndaq
 but


you
 also
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 Sweden


how
 come
 how
 come
 yes
 in
 fact
 we
 own
 and


operate
 the
 markets
 in
 the
 nordics
 other


than
 Norway
 um
 so
 Sweden
 Denmark
 Finland


Iceland
 and
 the
 three
 Baltic
 countries


we
 own
 and
 operate
 those
 markets
 and
 we


also
 have
 a
 market
 technology
 business


where
 we
 provide
 technology
 to
 the


world's
 market
 so
 130
 markets
 um
 rely
 on


us
 for
 their
 technology
 to
 run
 them
 to


run
 their
 markets
 and
 that's
 also


operated
 out
 of
 Sweden
 why
 haven't
 you


go
 Norway
 uh
 that
 you
 know
 we
 wanted
 to


have
 Norway
 you
 probably
 remember
 well


uh
 we
 decided
 to
 take
 a
 friendly


approach
 with
 the
 Norwegian
 exchange
 and


unfortunately
 there
 was
 another
 exchange


operator
 that
 tried
 to
 take
 a
 less


friendly
 approach
 and
 they
 unfortunately


won
 but
 we
 did
 try
 very
 hard
 to
 come
 in


as
 a
 friendly
 as
 a
 friendly
 partner
 to


The
 noran
 Exchange
 does
 each
 country


need
 a
 so
 exchange
 it's
 a
 good
 question


um
 I
 would
 say
 that
 each
 country
 wants


its
 own
 exchange
 and
 it's
 important
 to


recognize
 when
 you're
 forming
 a
 country


there
 are
 a
 few
 key
 pillars
 that
 really


underpin
 building
 a
 country
 you've
 got


roads
 and
 transportation
 you've
 got


education
 um
 and
 you
 have
 you
 have


airports
 and
 things
 to
 make
 it
 so
 people


can
 come
 in
 and
 out
 of
 the
 country
 but


you
 also
 have
 to
 have
 an
 economy
 and


when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 economy
 of
 a


country
 it's
 really
 underpinned
 by
 the


central
 bank
 and
 the
 exchange
 operator


and
 then
 the
 banking
 system
 and


exchanges
 are
 kind
 of
 a
 critical
 pillar


and
 they
 become
 kind
 of
 a
 national
 icon


to
 a
 country
 now
 does
 every
 country
 need


to
 have
 its
 own
 exchange
 I
 would
 say
 in


today's
 modern
 Capital
 markets
 you
 know


Capital
 flows
 are
 Global
 money
 moves


moves
 seemlessly
 around
 the
 world
 but


there
 are
 very
 local
 elements
 to


exchanges
 where
 they
 appeal
 to
 local


innovators
 local
 market
 participants


local
 investors
 and
 so
 there
 is
 a


benefit
 to
 having
 a
 country
 have
 its


exchange
 but
 having
 it
 connected
 into
 a


global
 ecosystem
 to
 to
 allow
 for
 more


Capital
 flows
 is
 what
 we
 think
 is
 the


the
 future
 of
 markets
 some
 people
 are


moving
 the
 listings
 right
 so
 instead
 of


being
 listed
 in
 in
 London
 for
 instance


they
 won't
 be
 listed
 in
 the
 US
 because


they
 think
 they
 get
 better
 valuations


how
 how
 does
 this
 work
 what
 is
 driving


these
 differences
 in
 valuation
 between


countries
 well
 I
 think
 first
 of
 all


having
 a
 listing
 in
 multiple
 countries


has
 been
 a
 part
 of
 the
 markets
 for
 quite


some
 time
 the
 ADR
 prob
 American


depository
 receipt
 or
 the
 gdr
 gdr
 which


is
 a
 global
 depository
 receipt
 I
 mean


those
 are
 contracts
 that
 have
 allowed


companies
 from
 other
 countries
 to
 go
 and


put
 a
 a
 second
 listing
 into
 a
 different


country
 but
 more
 and
 more
 what
 we're


finding
 is
 it's
 not
 so
 much
 the
 ADR


that's
 coming
 but
 the
 primary
 listing
 is


moving
 and
 I
 think
 the
 reason
 why
 you're


seeing
 companies
 choose
 from
 outside
 the


United
 States
 choose
 to
 move
 their


primary
 listing
 to
 the
 United
 States
 is


really
 because
 today
 the
 the
 United


States
 the
 markets
 are
 extremely
 liquid


they're
 the
 most
 liquid
 in
 the
 world
 we


have
 the
 most
 Diversified
 investor
 base


in
 the
 world
 so
 you
 have
 a
 really


healthy
 retail
 ecosystem
 in
 addition
 to


an
 Institutional
 ecosystem
 in
 addition


to
 let's
 say
 hedge
 fund
 community
 and


other
 you
 know
 other
 players
 that
 really


Drive
 Market
 liquidity
 and
 that
 allows


companies
 to
 raise
 capit
 more


efficiently
 and
 we
 also
 have
 kind
 of
 a


research
 ecosystem
 that
 allows
 investors


to
 understand
 these
 companies
 more


deeply
 which
 then
 gives
 them
 more


confidence
 to
 invest
 and
 all
 of
 that
 is


not
 by
 accident
 I
 mean
 that's
 been
 you


know
 the
 contract
 of
 the
 United
 States


in
 terms
 of
 all
 the
 work
 we've
 done
 to


develop
 our
 markets
 um
 and
 The


Innovation
 ecosystem
 is
 now
 playing
 to


our
 benefit
 I
 would
 point
 though
 to


Sweden
 as
 being
 an
 anomalous
 and
 very


very
 positive
 story
 in
 Europe
 um
 and
 I


really
 mean
 that
 and
 there's
 some
 great


there's
 some
 great
 um
 um
 anecdotes
 it's


all
 uh
 they
 got
 great
 this
 is
 an
 amazing


amazing
 startup
 ecosystem
 great


Innovation
 culture
 and
 a
 great
 Equity


Culture
 by
 their
 by
 their
 um
 their


citizens
 so
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 the
 data


and
 37%
 of
 people
 in
 Sweden
 have
 direct


retail
 accounts
 um
 for
 equities
 for


domestic
 equities
 and
 so
 if
 you
 think


about
 how
 empowerful
 that
 is
 inside
 an


economy
 where
 you
 have
 retail
 then
 you


have
 a
 great
 pension
 system
 and
 they


deploy
 Capital
 into
 the
 market
 then
 you


have
 Global
 flows
 you
 know
 Global


players
 who
 come
 in
 and
 participate
 in


that
 market
 because
 we
 have
 a
 great


market
 system
 and
 you
 also
 have
 these


tax
 advantage
 savings
 accounts
 that


encourage
 the
 citizenship
 to
 get


involved
 in
 retail
 I
 mean
 in
 in
 invest


in
 investing
 in
 equities
 and
 all
 of
 that


creates
 a
 combustion
 that
 again
 creates


a
 really
 great
 Market
 ecosystem
 in


Sweden
 so
 it's
 possible
 to
 do
 this
 in


countries
 outside
 the
 United
 States
 for


sure
 but
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 lot
 of


ingredients
 that
 have
 to
 come
 together


to
 create
 the
 right
 recipe
 if
 I
 start
 up


a
 company
 and
 it
 gets
 really
 big
 are
 you


going
 to
 call
 me
 and
 I'll
 whether
 I
 want


to
 list
 on
 NASDAQ
 well
 is
 that
 how
 it


works
 I
 would
 say
 that
 if
 you
 start
 a


company
 and
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 get


really
 big
 we
 will
 call
 you
 up
 and
 ask


if
 you
 want
 to
 list
 on
 NASDAQ
 so
 we
 list


companies
 of
 all
 sizes
 on
 NASDAQ
 and


we're
 very
 happy
 to
 have
 a
 startup
 come


and
 earlier
 in
 their
 life
 and
 choose
 to


make
 their
 their
 stock
 available
 to
 you


know
 everyday
 consumers
 and
 everyday
 uh


retail
 investors
 and
 then
 grow
 up
 as
 a


company
 like
 you
 know
 when
 Amazon
 went


public
 many
 you
 know
 a
 couple
 decades


ago
 they
 were
 worth
 $300
 million
 and


they've
 grown
 up
 as
 a
 public
 company
 and


done
 remarkably
 well
 in
 the
 public


market
 do
 all
 exchanges
 try
 to
 steal


them
 away
 from
 you
 um
 you
 know
 it
 used


to
 be
 that
 there
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 a
 view


that
 nasac
 was
 the
 home
 to
 smaller


companies
 but
 today
 nasc
 is
 home
 to
 the


largest
 companies
 in
 the
 world
 and
 and


what
 happened
 was
 these
 companies
 would


come
 to
 NASDAQ
 as
 small
 companies
 but


then
 they'd
 stay
 52
 years
 later
 we
 are


now
 the
 home
 we
 have
 $3
 trillion
 of


market
 cap
 listed
 on
 NASDAQ
 and
 we
 are


home
 to
 both
 the
 the
 largest
 companies


in
 the
 world
 I
 would
 say
 that
 we're


30
 trillion
 so
 and
 New
 York
 Stock


Exchange
 somewhere
 right
 around
 that
 so


we're
 almost
 equal
 you
 know
 they're
 we


are
 really
 neck
 and
 neck
 now
 for
 um
 the


market
 cap
 of
 the
 listed
 companies
 list


on
 NASDAQ
 versus
 New
 York
 and
 the
 fact


is
 that
 once
 they
 got
 to
 NASDAQ
 we
 gave


them
 a
 home
 when
 frankly
 at
 the
 time


because
 we
 were
 formed
 in
 1971
 and
 at


the
 time
 New
 York
 had
 rules
 that
 didn't


allow
 these
 companies
 to
 list
 there
 so


we
 started
 as
 a
 tech
 innovator
 in
 our


space
 we
 democratized
 access
 to
 the


capital
 markets
 for
 retail
 and
 we


actually
 had
 listing
 rules
 that
 allowed


young
 Innovative
 companies
 to
 come


before
 they
 were
 profitable
 and
 that
 was


a
 change
 in
 Paradigm
 in
 the
 United


States
 they
 came
 so
 the
 first
 class
 of


companies
 that
 come
 to
 nzq
 Comcast


Applied
 Materials
 Intel
 and
 and
 then
 a


really
 cool
 truck
 building
 company


called
 packar
 th
 that
 was
 the
 first


class
 and
 they're
 still
 here
 they're
 all


in
 the
 azac
 100
 and
 then
 we
 of
 course


attracted
 Microsoft
 and
 Apple
 and
 those


companies
 came
 and
 then
 they
 stayed


because
 they
 realized
 that
 we
 gave
 them


a
 home
 we
 gave
 them
 great
 service
 we


gave
 them
 a
 great
 market
 and
 and
 since


then
 we've
 also
 become
 great
 partners
 to


them
 from
 a
 technological
 perspective
 at


the
 same
 time
 um
 there
 are
 more
 private


companies
 than
 before
 now
 um
 it's
 partly


because
 of
 private
 Equity
 but
 it's
 also


because
 many
 companies
 um
 choose
 to
 to


stay
 private
 so
 why
 should
 companies
 go


public
 and
 have
 a
 listing
 instead
 of


being
 private
 well
 I
 think
 we
 could
 have


a
 really
 good
 engage
 discussion
 about


this
 Nikolai
 as
 a
 large
 asset
 owner


yourself
 as
 to
 how
 do
 you
 look
 at
 asset


allocation
 across
 private
 and
 public
 and


how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 the
 public


markets
 and
 what
 you're
 trying
 to


achieve
 in
 the
 public
 markets
 versus
 the


private
 markets
 but
 I
 think
 that
 there


are
 structural
 in
 cyclical
 reasons
 why


the
 the
 public
 markets
 are
 more
 or
 less


attractive
 to
 companies
 yeah
 but
 uh


cyclically
 of
 course
 it's
 just
 a
 matter


of
 are
 public
 investors
 ready
 to


underwrite
 risk
 in
 a
 time
 when
 you
 have


changing
 interest
 rate
 environment
 like


we're
 having
 right
 now
 but
 more


structurally
 it's
 the
 question
 is
 are
 is


the
 burden
 of
 being
 a
 public
 company


such
 that
 it
 makes
 it
 so
 that
 it
 becomes


more
 attractive
 to
 remain
 private
 and


that's
 where
 we
 have
 to
 work
 with
 the


government
 to
 think
 about
 the
 balance
 of


the
 regulatory
 balance
 between
 the


responsibility
 of
 being
 a
 public
 company


and
 making
 your
 stock
 available
 to


Everyday
 consumers
 and
 everyday
 retail


investors
 but
 also
 the
 the
 the
 ability


for
 you
 to
 continue
 to
 drive
 your


strategy
 change
 you
 know
 and
 make


changes
 and
 and
 continue
 to
 progress
 in


a
 way
 that
 is
 still
 attractive
 to
 to


institutional
 um
 investors
 will
 you
 also


make
 money
 on
 private
 companies
 at
 some


stage
 you
 think
 so
 we
 actually
 are


involved
 in
 private
 markets
 today
 in
 two


ways
 the
 first
 is
 nasc
 private
 Market


which
 allows
 for
 private
 companies
 to


seek
 liquidity
 periodic
 liquidity
 in


their
 stock
 so
 we
 can
 buy
 and
 sell


companies
 even
 though
 they're
 not
 listed


on
 a
 exchange
 that's
 correct
 but
 you


have
 to
 be
 a
 qualified
 buyer
 or
 an


Institutional
 buyer
 so
 there
 you
 know


it's
 a
 limited
 number
 of
 um
 investors


who
 are
 have
 that
 available
 to
 them
 and


then
 also
 we
 support
 the
 asset
 manager


and
 asset
 owner
 ecosystem
 but
 with
 our


tool
 called
 investment
 where
 we
 allow


for
 asset
 owners
 to
 make
 smart
 asset


allocation
 Decisions
 by
 seeking
 out
 the


asset
 you
 know
 the
 asset
 managers
 that


they
 find
 most
 attractive
 both
 public


and
 private
 and
 so
 we
 do
 get
 involved
 in


the
 private
 markets
 in
 in
 those
 ways
 now


there's
 been
 a
 trend
 over
 the
 last
 years


um
 towards
 high
 frequency
 trading
 right


so
 extremely
 uh
 frequent
 trading
 you


know
 measure
 it
 in
 Nan
 seconds
 uh
 we
 do


I
 suspect
 I
 I
 I
 I
 read
 that
 the
 light


travels
 only
 30
 m
 in
 a
 nanc
 so
 pretty
 uh


pretty
 short
 period
 um
 now
 how
 does
 this


um
 how
 does
 this
 high
 frequency
 trading


work
 yeah
 is
 it
 good
 for
 you
 is
 it
 good


for
 you
 I
 mean
 I
 would
 say
 that
 it's


good
 for
 the
 system
 so
 I
 will
 say
 it


that
 way
 because
 what
 we
 look
 for
 with


high
 frequency
 trading
 firms
 they
 really


are
 the
 modern
 market
 makers
 they're


committing
 Capital
 into
 the
 market
 and


even
 if
 they're
 committing
 Capital
 into


the
 market
 for
 a
 very
 short
 period
 of


time
 they
 are
 there
 to
 make
 it
 so
 that


any
 given
 time
 you
 as
 an
 as
 an
 asset


owner
 or
 any
 asset
 manager
 or
 any
 retail


investor
 can
 come
 in
 and
 put
 an
 order
 in


the
 market
 and
 get
 it
 executed


instantaneously
 at
 any
 time
 and
 there's


price
 Discovery
 all
 the
 time
 meaning


there's
 always
 a
 bit
 offer
 spread


available
 stock
 so
 you
 know
 exactly
 what


you
 can
 where
 you
 can
 buy
 it
 and
 sell
 it


at
 what
 price
 that's
 what
 the
 high


frequency
 firms
 provide
 to
 markets
 all


over
 the
 world
 and
 while
 they
 are
 doing


it
 in
 in
 very
 small
 increments
 and


they're
 doing
 it
 in
 very
 short
 periods


of
 time
 they
 are
 there
 constantly
 to
 be


that
 liquidity
 provider
 so
 they
 provide


an
 important
 service
 and
 at
 the
 same


time
 they
 make
 money
 so
 you
 know
 of


course
 they're
 going
 to
 make
 money
 in


terms
 of
 very
 small
 tickets
 and
 and
 kind


of
 the
 the
 differences
 in
 the
 spread
 as


well
 as
 making
 it
 so
 that
 they're
 taking


risk
 and
 they're
 getting
 rewarded
 for


taking
 risk
 something
 called
 Dark
 pools


how
 do
 you
 work
 with
 them
 so
 the
 dark


pools
 actually
 compete
 with
 the
 lit


markets
 yeah
 so
 that's
 a
 little
 bit


different
 right
 so
 I
 would
 say
 that
 they


bad
 news
 well
 for
 you
 okay
 so
 the


financial
 industry
 we
 think
 they
 are


good
 news
 yeah
 well
 the
 financial


industry
 is
 a
 world
 of
 coopertition
 yeah


so
 I
 just
 need
 to
 say
 that
 like
 there's


no
 black
 there's
 no
 kind
 of
 bright
 lines


here
 it's
 really
 a
 matter
 of
 finding


ways
 to
 work
 with
 everyone
 in
 the


context
 and
 and
 basically
 working
 with


our
 clients
 where
 they
 are
 y
 so
 for
 dark


pools
 NASDAQ


does
 compete
 for
 order
 flow
 from
 dark


pools
 but
 we
 also
 provide
 technology
 to


dark
 pools
 so
 we
 actually
 do
 provide
 our


trading
 systems
 and
 make
 those
 available


to
 dark
 pools
 if
 they
 want
 to
 partner


with
 us
 and
 we
 will
 actually
 operate


those
 dark
 pools
 on
 their
 behalf
 as
 a


technology
 provider
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time


we
 will
 compete
 with
 them
 to
 try
 to
 get


the
 order
 flow
 onto
 the
 lit
 markets
 now


in
 the
 US
 and
 in
 Europe
 so
 in
 the
 Europe


I
 would
 say
 about
 50%
 of
 the
 trading
 in


Europe
 occurs
 in
 dark
 pools
 and


internalizers
 and
 the
 same
 almost
 the


same
 in
 the
 US
 it's
 about
 45%
 of
 the


trading
 occurs
 in
 dark
 pools
 and
 in


internalizers
 so
 in
 a
 dark
 pool
 you


don't
 really
 see
 who
 the
 buyer
 and
 the


set
 is
 I
 mean
 that's
 the
 challenge
 is


that
 if
 you're
 an
 investor
 and
 you
 want


to
 understand
 what's
 the
 best
 price
 to


buy
 and
 sell
 my
 stock
 the
 dark
 pools


don't
 contribute
 to
 that
 information


because
 they're
 everything's
 happening


in
 the
 dark
 that's
 why
 they're
 called


Dark
 PS
 and
 you
 have
 to
 be
 a
 very


sophisticated
 investor
 to
 gain
 access
 to


them
 so
 we
 think
 that
 it's
 important
 to


make
 sure
 you're
 at
 least
 creating
 a


competitive
 playing
 field
 that
 allows


the
 lit
 venues
 to
 compete
 on
 an
 equal


basis
 with
 the
 dark
 pools
 to
 make
 it
 so


we
 can
 we
 can
 be
 the
 first
 place
 that


you
 want
 to
 place
 that
 order
 and
 not


into
 the
 dark
 the
 fact
 that
 there
 is
 so


much
 concentration
 in
 the
 market
 now
 you


know
 a
 few
 companies
 account
 for
 a
 huge


proportion
 of
 the
 value
 of
 the
 so


exchange
 is
 that
 a
 is
 that
 a
 worry
 um
 I


mean
 I
 would
 have
 to
 say
 that's
 just
 the


nature
 of
 the
 economy
 as
 it's
 kind
 of


been
 progressing
 right
 you
 have
 these


huge
 companies
 that
 have
 really
 defined


the
 future
 of
 our
 economy
 really
 in


terms
 of
 the
 technological
 innovation


that
 they're
 underwriting
 the
 risk


they're
 taking
 the
 scale
 that
 they're


providing
 to
 really
 under
 pin
 the
 future


of
 technology
 and
 they
 have
 therefore


become
 very
 large
 parts
 of
 the
 economy


because
 the
 entire
 economy
 is
 becoming


te
 technological
 yeah
 and
 so
 it's
 really


a
 n
 the
 natural
 progression
 of
 economy


towards
 these


technological
 um
 phenomenon
 really
 I
 I


think
 that
 at
 the
 same
 time
 there
 are


still
 5,000
 companies
 listed
 on
 NASDAQ


so
 it's
 not
 like
 there
 are
 many
 many


companies
 that
 are
 innovators
 and
 change


agents
 and
 people
 who
 are
 in
 every


single
 sector
 of
 the
 economy
 creating


change
 driving
 new
 things
 bringing
 new


ideas
 into
 the
 market
 and
 also
 and
 or


and
 are
 just
 very
 mature
 companies


operating
 in
 in
 every
 sector
 in
 the


economy
 so
 I
 don't
 actually
 agree
 that


it's
 a
 bad
 thing
 it
 is
 the
 nature
 of


econom
 the
 economy
 as
 it
 exists
 today


because
 technology
 is
 such
 a
 huge


driving
 force
 of
 the
 E
 economy
 changing


t
 a
 bit
 here
 um
 so
 Adina
 you
 became
 CEO


in
 2017
 yes
 what
 does
 one
 do
 when
 one


becomes
 the
 CEO
 of
 a
 big
 company
 how
 do


you
 approach
 it
 well
 I
 think
 first
 it's


important
 to
 understand
 what
 you're


walking
 into
 so
 I
 I
 started
 at
 nzac
 as


an
 intern
 31
 years
 ago
 yeah
 uh
 so
 I
 knew


the
 company
 very
 well
 whil
 you
 were
 at


University
 uh
 right
 after
 yeah
 so
 um
 so


I
 knew
 the
 company
 very
 well
 coming
 into


the
 role
 of
 CEO
 but
 you
 also
 have
 to


make
 sure
 that
 you're
 looking
 at
 with


fresh
 eyes
 and
 understanding
 kind
 of


where
 where
 is
 the
 company
 at
 the
 time


the
 second
 thing
 is
 that
 I
 came
 into
 a


company
 that
 was
 very
 well-managed
 and


and
 had
 a
 great
 foundation
 so
 it
 was
 I


had
 the
 fortune
 of
 coming
 into
 the
 seat


and
 playing
 offense
 from
 day
 one
 yeah
 so


my
 first
 year
 as
 CEO
 we
 really
 focus
 on


driving
 our
 strategy
 did
 you
 set
 a
 new


leader
 group
 when
 you
 came
 in
 um
 not


when
 I
 not
 when
 I
 took
 um
 over
 as
 CEO


but
 in
 the
 Years
 progressing
 up
 till
 I


became
 CEO
 I
 was
 able
 to
 develop
 the


team
 that
 I
 was
 able
 to
 have
 as
 CEO
 so


the
 the
 prior
 CEO
 gave
 me
 the
 latitude


to
 say
 okay
 how
 do
 you
 want
 to
 form
 your


team
 how
 do
 you
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 you've


got
 the
 right
 people
 in
 the
 right
 seats


to
 take
 us
 forward
 and
 he
 and
 I
 work


together
 on
 making
 that
 happen
 so
 that
 I


came
 in
 with
 a
 strong
 found


great
 business
 great
 team
 and
 then
 it


was
 a
 matter
 of
 okay
 but
 how
 can
 we
 run


faster
 how
 did
 how
 long
 did
 you
 work


together
 in
 a
 transition
 period
 I
 came


back
 to
 NASDAQ
 I
 had
 left
 NASDAQ
 to
 go


and
 become
 the
 CFO
 of
 Carlile
 for
 three


years
 and
 I
 helped
 them
 go
 public
 and
 I


came
 back
 in
 2014
 as
 president
 I
 became


CE
 in
 2017
 so
 we
 we
 work
 together
 almost


three
 years
 yeah
 uh
 and
 that
 I
 think


quite
 long
 period
 right
 but
 it
 was
 I
 I


had
 to
 prove
 myself
 when
 I
 got
 back
 it


wasn't
 like
 oh
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 CEO
 it


was
 you
 could
 become
 CEO
 right
 you
 were


there
 other
 people
 at
 the
 same
 time
 who


also
 could
 become
 CEO
 like
 was
 there
 was


it
 a
 race
 going
 on
 it
 was
 there
 was
 no


race
 it
 was
 more
 just
 making
 sure
 that
 I


was
 ready
 so
 if
 you
 don't
 make
 a


complete
 fool
 of
 yourself
 you'll
 be
 the


CEO
 or
 if
 I
 can
 show
 that
 I
 can
 really


drive
 the
 company
 forward
 I
 can
 be
 the


CEO
 which
 I
 did
 I
 I
 like
 to
 think
 um
 so


but
 this
 transition
 was
 very
 smooth
 I


mean
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 textbook


transition
 and
 so
 I
 took
 the
 job
 and
 the


first
 thing
 we
 did
 we
 had
 two
 strategic


efforts
 right
 when
 I
 started
 one
 was


let's
 redefine
 the
 strategy
 of
 the


company
 and
 two
 was
 let's
 really
 dive


into
 how
 can
 we
 Revitalize
 the
 US


capital
 markets
 because
 again
 we
 were
 at


a
 period
 where
 we
 weren't
 getting
 a
 lot


of
 IPOs
 and
 um
 the
 regulatory
 burden
 was


becoming
 quite
 onerous
 and
 so
 we
 wanted


to
 make
 sure
 we
 were
 recalibrating
 the


markets
 but
 but
 the
 focus
 on
 strategy


was
 a
 great
 way
 to
 engage
 the
 team
 right


off
 the
 bat
 you
 know
 so
 we
 know
 that


we're
 a
 great
 Market
 operator
 but
 we


also
 knew
 that
 we
 had
 the
 ingredients
 to


be
 a
 lot
 more
 so
 we
 took
 a
 a
 a
 kind
 of
 a


three-prong
 roach
 to
 evaluating
 the


strategy
 one
 was
 what
 are
 the
 technology


trends
 that
 are
 going
 to
 redefine
 our


industry
 in
 the
 next
 decade
 so
 let's


have
 conviction
 on
 that
 two
 was
 what
 are


the
 what
 are
 the
 industry
 trends
 that


are
 going
 to
 redefine
 our
 clients
 over


the
 next
 decade
 so
 we
 know
 where
 do
 we


you
 know
 how
 do
 we
 want
 to
 align


ourselves
 with
 that
 and
 three
 was
 what


do
 our
 clients
 think
 we're
 great
 at
 what


do
 they
 think
 we're
 not
 good
 at
 and
 what


do
 they
 think
 where
 do
 they
 see
 us
 as
 a


strategic
 partner
 so
 we
 took
 all
 of
 that


input
 and
 we
 brought
 it
 to
 the
 team
 and


we
 said
 okay
 how
 do
 we
 redefine
 where


we're
 going
 going
 we
 had
 technology


assets
 we
 were
 already
 providing


technology
 to
 other
 exchanges
 we
 were


providing
 technology
 to
 corporates
 to


help
 them
 manage
 their
 lives
 in
 the


public
 markets
 but
 it
 wasn't
 we
 weren't


a
 scaled
 player
 in
 that
 space
 we
 were
 a


very
 Niche
 provider
 and
 we
 went
 out
 to


our
 clients
 they
 said
 you're
 really
 good


at
 what
 you
 do
 you're
 a
 great
 Market


operator
 but
 here
 are
 my
 biggest
 problem


so
 with
 banks
 it
 was
 dealing
 with
 a
 lot


of
 regulatory
 risk
 dealing
 with
 a
 lot
 of


you
 know
 Capital
 risk
 and
 we've
 got
 a


lot
 to
 do
 in
 managing
 criminals
 out
 of


our
 networks
 so
 then
 you
 bought
 quite
 a


few
 take
 that's
 right
 and
 then
 we
 also


kind
 what
 kind
 of
 things
 did
 you
 buy
 so


in
 for
 that
 particular
 area
 of
 our


strategy
 which
 we
 kind
 of
 look
 at
 as
 the


liquidity
 and
 the
 in
 the
 Integrity


strategy
 um
 we
 focus
 in
 two
 areas
 one
 is


scaling
 up
 our
 Capital
 markets


technology
 to
 be
 not
 only
 the
 best
 at


providing
 technology
 to
 other
 exchanges


we
 also
 rewrote
 our
 entire
 trade
 life


cycle
 technology
 ourselves
 that
 we're


now
 deploying
 to
 our
 clients
 but
 we
 also


we
 also
 scaled
 up
 in
 terms
 of
 being
 a


great
 a
 great
 technology
 provider
 to


other
 exchanges


and
 through
 the
 clipo
 which
 is
 through


the
 Adena
 acquisition
 the
 clipo
 product


is
 a
 scaled
 risk
 management
 platform
 for


all
 of
 the
 market
 participants
 in
 the


world
 and
 so
 it
 allows
 them
 to
 to
 manage


their
 lives
 in
 the
 markets
 much
 more


successfully
 so
 that
 was
 one
 one
 part
 of


our
 strategy
 the
 other
 part
 was
 we


bought
 verafin
 and
 axml
 also
 part
 of
 the


adenda
 transaction
 to
 be
 a
 scale


provider
 of
 regulatory
 reporting
 and


anti-financial
 crime
 technology
 um
 and


we
 we
 compl
 that
 with
 our
 surveillance


technology
 so
 we
 now
 can
 help
 them


really
 manage
 all
 of
 the
 Integrity


capabilities
 within
 the
 banks
 and


Brokers
 and
 all
 the
 capital
 markets
 Tech


within
 the
 banks
 and
 Brokers
 and


exchanges
 that
 really
 make
 it
 so
 that


they
 can
 get
 on
 the
 field
 successfully


and
 be
 successful
 so
 now
 the
 stock


exchange
 bit
 is
 actually
 the
 division


where
 you
 make
 the
 least
 money
 which
 is


quite
 interesting
 but
 um
 now
 this


company
 called
 verafin
 which
 is
 is
 a


leader
 in
 anti-financial
 crime
 Solutions


yes
 and
 so
 I
 didn't
 know
 you
 had
 that


before
 I
 started
 to
 read
 up
 on
 you
 why


are
 you
 fighting
 Financial
 crime
 how


does
 that
 come
 into
 it
 yeah
 it's
 great


question
 so
 we
 had
 been
 uh
 we
 have
 been


a
 provider
 of
 surveillance
 technology


for
 trading
 firms
 and
 for
 exchanges


since
 2010
 and
 what
 that
 means
 is
 we


helped
 them
 root
 out
 Market
 manipulation


and
 criminal
 activity
 within
 the
 markets


and
 within
 their
 trading
 firms
 and
 when


we
 went
 and
 talked
 to
 them
 about
 what


could
 we
 do
 to
 expand
 and
 we
 did
 a


complete
 strategic
 review
 of
 how
 can
 we


expand
 this
 business
 great
 business
 and


it's
 growing
 really
 well
 it's
 a
 SAS


technology
 it's
 it's
 very
 modern
 so
 how


can
 we
 make
 it
 so
 that
 we
 get
 bigger


there
 because
 it
 was
 just
 it's
 a
 very


great
 segment
 for
 us
 to
 play
 in
 they
 all


said
 you
 know
 what
 we're
 really


challenged
 with
 is
 anti-money
 laundering


and
 fraud
 within
 the
 banking
 system
 can


you
 help
 us
 with
 that
 and
 we
 said
 okay


well
 that's
 good
 to
 know
 so
 we
 went
 back


and
 we
 evaluated
 every
 single
 company
 in


the
 space
 of
 anti-financial
 crime
 and
 we


actually
 came
 out
 with
 one
 name
 of
 one


company
 that
 we
 thought
 was
 the
 best
 in


the
 business
 and
 by
 far
 the
 most


technologically
 advanced
 they
 had
 2
 200


clients
 they
 were
 very
 scaled
 in
 the


United
 States
 um
 but
 they
 hadn't
 yet


reached
 the
 tier
 one
 and
 tier
 2
 Banks


and
 that's
 our
 that's
 where
 we
 were


really
 strong
 so
 we
 knew
 we
 could


complement
 their
 capabilities
 and
 that's


verin
 and
 they
 were
 not
 for
 sale
 um
 so


but
 you
 managed
 to
 buy
 them
 you
 yeah
 it


yeah
 we
 did
 we
 we
 went
 to
 the
 owner
 we


talked
 to
 them
 we
 went
 to
 the
 firm
 we


talked
 to
 them
 and
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


they
 saw
 us
 as
 the
 great
 a
 great
 partner


because
 we
 they're
 growing
 you
 know
 20


plus
 percent
 a
 year
 so
 they're
 just
 a


fast
 grower
 incredible
 technology
 we


could
 learn
 a
 lot
 from
 them
 but
 they


could
 learn
 a
 lot
 from
 us
 in
 terms
 of


how
 they
 go
 up
 Market
 is
 there
 a
 lot
 of


crime
 in
 markets
 there's
 an
 enormous


amount
 of
 crime
 in
 the
 financial
 crime


so
 they
 there's
 an
 estimate
 that
 there


is3
 trillion
 that
 is
 laundered
 through


the
 system
 the
 financial
 system
 globally


every
 year
 and
 half
 a
 trillion
 dollars


that's
 lost
 to
 fraud
 every
 year
 and


that's
 that's
 globally
 in
 the
 US
 we
 kind


of
 we
 zeroed
 in
 on
 the
 fraud
 the
 fraud


Challenge
 and
 in
 the
 United
 States


there's
 $150
 billion
 dollar
 loss
 to


fraud
 every
 year
 that
 if
 you
 think
 about


that
 if
 we
 were
 able
 to
 recover
 all
 that


fraud
 and
 keep
 that
 in
 the
 in
 the
 right


the
 right
 hands
 and
 to
 the
 hands
 to
 the


consumers
 that
 would
 increase
 our
 GDP
 by


50
 basis
 points
 so
 we
 would
 you
 the
 GDP


of
 the
 country
 would
 be
 growing
 at
 a


half%
 more
 if
 that
 that
 money
 wasn't


lost
 to
 fraud
 so
 w
 well
 we
 can
 need
 that


in
 Europe
 well
 and
 then
 and
 in
 Europe
 I


think
 the
 unique
 element
 of
 the
 United


States
 and
 why
 um
 verin
 been
 so


successful
 here
 is
 that
 there's
 a
 law


that
 allows
 Banks
 to
 share
 um
 certain


information
 in
 order
 to
 fight
 crime
 so


they
 can
 share
 it
 with
 a
 third
 party


they
 can't
 share
 it
 with
 each
 other
 we


can
 share
 it
 with
 a
 neutral
 third
 party


we
 are
 that
 neutral
 third
 party
 so
 we


have
 created
 a
 consortial
 data
 Lake
 made


up
 of
 all
 of
 the
 banks
 um
 transactions


from
 across
 across
 2500
 Banks
 we
 get


about
 a
 billion
 transactions
 a
 week


through
 that
 platform
 and
 we
 then
 apply


very
 Advanced
 AI
 algorithms
 to
 be
 better


than
 anyone
 in
 rooting
 out
 criminal


behavior
 that
 then
 makes
 it
 so
 the
 banks


could
 be
 more
 efficient
 fewer
 false


positives
 and
 more
 effective
 by
 showing


them
 more
 F
 real
 positives
 to
 make
 it
 so


that
 their
 fraud
 program
 is
 much
 more


effective
 same
 with
 AML
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


more
 more
 complicated
 problem
 but


similar
 approach
 let's
 move
 on
 to
 you


and
 um
 kind
 of
 the
 leadership
 um
 now


what
 kind
 of
 experiences
 during
 your


career
 have
 you
 had
 that
 you
 think
 have


shaped
 your
 leadership
 style
 the
 most


well
 I
 had
 a
 couple
 um
 so
 the
 first
 was


when
 I
 was
 30
 I
 became
 the
 head
 of
 the


data
 division
 so
 they
 had
 the
 company


decided
 to
 reorganize
 we
 had
 a
 trading


Division
 and
 a
 listings
 Division
 and


data
 set
 within
 the
 trading
 Division
 and


they
 decided
 to
 branch
 that
 out
 and
 make


it
 its
 own
 division
 so
 we
 ended
 up
 with


three
 divisions
 at
 NASDAQ
 and
 when
 I
 was


30
 they
 asked
 me
 to
 be
 ahead
 of
 it
 so


that
 was
 a
 big
 one
 uh
 and
 I
 had
 been


running
 products
 so
 I've
 been
 running


some
 of
 the
 data
 products
 as
 a
 product


manager
 couple
 of
 the
 trading
 products


so
 I
 was
 already
 you
 know
 I
 was
 already


kind
 of
 owning
 the
 business
 of
 these


products
 but
 then
 to
 run
 an
 entire


division
 was
 a
 huge
 step
 up
 and
 I


learned
 a
 lot
 I
 I
 had
 to
 learn
 a
 lot


because
 first
 of
 all
 I
 had
 to
 recognize


the
 fact
 that
 I
 didn't
 know
 everything


for
 the
 first
 time
 and
 I
 had
 to
 really


rely
 on
 others
 who
 knew
 a
 lot
 more
 than


I
 did
 and
 the
 second
 thing
 is
 that
 I
 had


to
 scale
 a
 business
 I
 mean
 I
 had
 to


create
 a
 business
 and
 scale
 a
 business


within
 a
 company
 and
 that
 was
 a
 a
 great


opportunity
 for
 me
 to
 demonstrate


leadership
 skills
 you
 have
 a
 mentor
 who


helped
 you
 on
 the
 way
 did
 um
 I
 did
 so


our
 my
 first
 manager
 was
 a
 great
 mentor


and
 he
 I
 had
 he
 was
 my
 manager
 for
 seven


years
 he
 ran
 the
 trading
 business
 so


then
 when
 I
 um
 when
 I
 branched
 out
 and


took
 the
 data
 business
 he
 actually


retired
 but
 he
 remained
 a
 great
 mentor


to
 me
 and
 just
 a
 you
 know
 someone
 who


could
 help
 me
 what
 is
 a
 good
 Mentor
 do
 a


good
 Mentor
 is
 there
 to
 listen
 um
 to


give
 you
 and
 I
 would
 say
 Mentor
 SLS


sponsor
 because
 I
 think
 they're
 slightly


different
 but
 in
 that
 that
 particular


case
 he
 was
 both
 a
 mentor
 and
 a
 sponsor


so
 what's
 the
 difference
 I
 I
 would
 say
 a


mentor
 is
 someone
 who
 does
 not
 have
 a


vested
 interest
 in
 your
 personal
 career


that
 they're
 there
 to
 be
 kind
 of
 an


outside
 adviser
 to
 look
 in
 and
 say
 let's


talk
 about
 where
 you
 want
 to
 go
 what
 are


the
 things
 that
 you
 do
 well
 what
 do
 you


want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 better
 you
 know


what's
 holding
 you
 back
 and
 helping
 you


navigate
 your
 career
 but
 without
 a


vested
 interest
 in
 your
 career
 sponsor


has
 a
 vested
 interest
 in
 your
 career


meaning
 they
 might
 be
 your
 boss
 or
 your


boss's
 boss
 and
 they're
 there
 to
 say
 let


me
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 catalyze
 your


career
 and
 make
 it
 so
 that
 you
 can
 move


faster
 up
 an
 organization
 but
 here
 are


the
 skills
 and
 capabilities
 that
 you


need
 to
 be
 developing
 let's
 work


together
 on
 making
 sure
 that
 that


happens
 that's
 a
 sponsor
 how
 many
 people


do
 you
 feel
 that
 you
 sponsor
 that
 you


have
 a
 like
 a
 where
 you
 have
 a
 in
 a
 way


a
 vested
 interest
 or
 you
 really
 follow


the
 carrier
 moves
 well
 I
 mean
 I
 I


certainly
 in
 a
 way
 you
 are
 a
 sponsor
 to


all
 of
 your
 direct
 reports
 but
 they've


gotten
 to
 the
 point
 where
 they
 have


moved
 up
 all
 all
 the
 way
 through
 the


organization
 so
 ordinarily
 if
 you're
 a


sponsor
 you're
 looking
 one
 or
 two
 or


three
 levels
 down
 in
 the
 organization


and
 I
 would
 say
 that
 I'm
 you
 know
 I


don't
 claim
 myself
 to
 be
 a
 sponsor


because
 oftentimes
 it's
 not
 it's
 not


something
 you
 explicitly
 discuss
 but


there
 are
 certainly
 many
 people
 within


the
 organization
 that
 I
 feel
 that
 I
 have


a
 bestest
 interest
 in
 watching
 and


helping
 them
 with
 their
 success
 as
 a


mentor
 I
 do
 actually
 take
 on
 um
 formal


mentorship
 and
 I
 usually
 have
 two


mentors
 at
 a
 time
 so
 or
 mentees
 sorry
 at


a
 time
 um
 down
 further
 down
 in
 the


organization
 where
 I'm
 there
 to
 help


them
 think
 about
 their
 career


differently
 or
 to
 help
 them
 develop


skills
 but
 I'm
 not
 in
 there
 I'm
 not


directly
 assigned
 to
 their
 to
 helping


them
 with
 their
 career
 but
 I
 am


ultimately
 helping
 them
 think
 about


their
 career
 differently
 so
 that
 they


can
 then
 navigate
 their
 career


successfully
 what
 did
 you
 learn
 at
 car


well
 I
 went
 to
 Carlile
 to
 be
 their
 CFO


and
 to
 help
 them
 go
 public
 so
 a
 few


things
 first
 uh
 Carl
 a
 different
 part
 of


the
 industry
 so
 I
 learned
 private
 equity


and
 fascinating
 part
 of
 the
 business
 I'd


always
 in
 my
 heart
 thought
 I
 wanted
 to


go
 into
 the
 buy
 side
 because
 my
 dad
 had


been
 in
 the
 investment
 management


industry
 my
 brother
 was
 running
 a
 hedge


fund
 so
 I
 thought
 this
 is
 where
 I
 was


destined
 to
 be
 so
 I
 went
 into
 Carlile


and
 learned
 the
 private
 Equity
 industry


that
 was
 one
 two
 very
 different
 culture


uh
 it's
 a
 collaborative
 culture
 as


opposed
 to
 nzq
 being
 a
 little
 bit
 more


at
 the
 time
 at
 least
 a
 command
 and


control
 culture
 so
 understanding
 how
 to


manage
 a
 partnership
 as
 opposed
 to
 a
 C


Corp
 you
 know
 a
 more
 hierarchical


business
 was
 very
 interesting
 I
 had


three
 bosses
 so
 very
 different
 way
 of


doing
 business
 and
 I
 think
 I
 learned
 a


lot
 from
 that
 in
 a
 positive
 way
 and
 then


the
 third
 thing
 was
 that
 the
 finance


organization
 at
 that
 time
 was
 bigger
 um


it
 was
 more
 complicated
 and
 it
 was
 very


Global
 so
 for
 me
 I
 also
 was
 able
 to


expand
 my
 leadership
 skills
 while
 we


took
 the
 company
 through
 a
 very
 unique


journey
 of
 going
 public
 so
 learning
 how


to
 take
 a
 company
 public
 was
 a
 great


skill
 because
 when
 I
 got
 back
 to
 NASDAQ


I
 was
 able
 to
 look
 out
 and
 say
 what
 was


that
 project
 process
 really
 like
 are
 we


doing
 enough
 to
 support
 our
 clients
 as


they're
 going
 public


can
 nasac
 be
 a
 better
 partner
 to
 our


clients
 as
 in
 in
 the
 process
 of
 going


public
 so
 it
 actually
 brought
 a
 lot
 of


knowledge
 back
 that
 I
 was
 able
 to
 apply


to
 the
 business
 do
 you
 think
 you're
 a


better
 leader
 now
 than
 when
 you
 were
 30


oh
 definitely
 what's
 uh
 how
 are
 you


different
 well
 when
 you're
 30
 and
 you're


taking
 on
 you
 know
 you
 you
 kind
 of
 want


to
 think
 that
 you
 know
 everything
 for


one
 thing
 and
 second
 of
 all
 you're


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 not
 to
 do


everything
 but
 to
 make
 it
 all
 get
 done


the
 way
 that
 you
 want
 it
 you
 know
 that's


like
 if
 you
 know
 what
 I
 mean
 I
 mean
 you


know
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 scalability
 to


that
 that
 has
 some
 limitations
 um
 so


when
 you're
 30
 you're
 trying
 to
 learn


new
 skills
 learn
 how
 to
 manage
 learn
 how


to
 lead
 and
 obviously
 drive
 a
 business


forward
 and
 so
 there's
 a
 lot
 that
 you're


learning
 that
 you
 probably
 are
 not
 doing


perfectly
 how
 do
 you
 do
 it
 differently


now
 so
 when
 you
 go
 from
 being
 a
 manager


to
 a
 leader
 it's
 the
 difference


between
 directing
 people
 in
 their


activities
 to
 empowering
 people
 so
 that


they
 can
 be
 empowered
 to
 do
 a
 better
 job


at
 their
 job
 than
 you
 can
 do
 at
 their


job
 isn't
 that
 just
 amazing
 and
 that
 is


a
 total
 difference
 isn't
 it
 just
 amazing


you
 ask
 people
 to
 do
 something
 without


um
 setting
 any
 limitations
 or
 defining


it
 to
 uh
 kind
 of
 accurately
 and
 then


they
 just
 come
 up
 with
 things
 which
 is


beyond
 what
 you
 could
 do
 what
 beyond


what
 you
 could
 do
 so
 what
 does
 that


require
 I
 love
 it
 it
 requires
 a
 lot
 of


trust
 yeah
 and
 you
 have
 to
 the
 the
 most


important
 thing
 a
 leader
 can
 do
 is
 put


the
 right
 people
 in
 the
 right
 seats
 yeah


and
 it
 and
 and
 to
 think
 I
 want
 to
 put
 a


person
 in
 that
 seat
 that
 will
 be
 better


at
 their
 job
 than
 I
 can
 ever
 be
 at
 their


job
 because
 they
 by
 them
 being
 better


their
 jobs
 all
 of
 them
 then
 you
 the


whole
 company
 is
 a
 better
 company
 and


you
 get
 a
 chance
 to
 empower
 them
 to
 do


great
 things
 and
 to
 and
 to
 make
 sure


your
 you
 know
 Capital
 allocation


decision
 set
 the
 vision
 set
 the


direction
 make
 sure
 you've
 got
 the


capital
 allocation
 decisions
 to
 drive


that
 direction
 successfully
 pick
 a
 few


projects
 where
 you
 want
 to
 get


personally
 involved
 and
 otherwise


empower
 the
 team
 to
 do
 great
 things
 it


it
 takes
 some
 confidence
 right
 yes
 I


would
 agree
 with
 that
 it
 takes


confidence
 in
 yourself
 but
 it
 also
 takes


confidence
 in
 the
 team
 and
 it's


difficult
 do
 when
 you're
 30
 because
 if


they
 do
 everything
 better
 than
 you
 they


are
 be
 going
 to
 become
 B
 not
 you
 right


right
 well
 in
 fact
 that
 was
 an


interesting
 moment
 for
 me
 because
 when
 I


took
 the
 job
 as
 the
 head
 of
 the
 data


division
 there
 had
 been
 someone
 who
 was


running
 data
 within
 the
 trading
 division


right
 and
 he
 was
 not
 the
 person
 that


ultimately
 took
 the
 job
 so
 he
 worked
 for


me
 and
 that
 was
 a
 an
 interesting


transition
 from
 being
 a
 peer
 to
 to


having
 that
 kind
 of
 relationship
 so
 I


did
 have
 to
 learn
 and
 I
 learned
 very


quickly
 he
 knew
 a
 a
 ton
 that
 I
 did
 not


know
 and
 he
 was
 great
 at
 certain


elements
 of
 the
 job
 so
 so
 I
 my
 job
 was


to
 empower
 him
 and
 that
 was
 the
 first


time
 I
 had
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 work


with
 someone
 who
 knew
 more
 than
 I
 did


about
 something
 and
 who
 and
 was
 better


at
 certain
 things
 than
 I
 was
 at


something
 you
 know
 and
 so
 how
 do
 we
 how


do
 you
 Empower
 that
 person
 how
 do
 you


bring
 them
 in
 as
 an
 advisor
 how
 do
 they


and
 and
 working
 successfully
 with
 them


and
 I
 actually
 have
 to
 say
 I
 think
 that


was
 one
 of
 my
 big
 learnings
 in
 when
 I


when
 I
 took
 the
 job
 as
 data
 so
 that
 when


I
 ultimately
 became
 the
 CFO
 that
 was
 the


first
 time
 when
 I
 realized
 that
 I
 had
 to


go
 from
 being
 a
 manager
 to
 like
 a
 true


leader
 and
 um
 and
 because
 there
 were
 a


lot
 of
 elements
 of
 finance
 that
 I


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 expertise
 embedded
 in


the
 team
 and
 I
 was
 never
 going
 to
 know


everything
 and
 that
 moment
 of
 realizing


my
 job
 is
 to
 empower
 them
 to
 do
 great


things
 that
 was
 a
 that
 was
 a
 big
 step
 up


for
 for
 me
 personally
 let's
 talk
 about


culture
 um
 how
 many
 people
 are
 you
 uh
 we


have
 about
 8,500
 employees
 um
 all
 around


the
 world
 what
 and
 what
 do
 they
 do
 about


half
 the
 team
 are
 technologists
 so
 uh


software
 engineers
 and
 all
 the
 all
 the


people
 that
 support
 software
 engineering


and
 then
 we
 have
 obviously
 a
 large
 sales


organization
 a
 product
 team
 that
 really


help
 what
 I
 call
 business
 product
 team


that
 really
 supports
 the
 business


strategy
 and
 the
 execution
 of
 the


strategy
 ac
 across
 the
 business
 and
 then


we
 have
 Market
 structure
 experts
 legal


and
 Regulatory
 experts
 um
 and
 and
 then


of
 course
 all
 of
 the
 corporate
 functions


so
 and
 what
 type
 of
 people
 do
 you
 hire
 I


mean
 let's
 say
 now
 um
 you
 interview
 me


what
 are
 you
 looking
 for
 so
 the
 first


thing
 I
 would
 look
 for
 is
 someone
 who


has
 is
 a
 team
 oriented
 person
 so


confidence
 what
 we
 call
 confidence
 and


humility
 right
 so
 you
 have
 to
 understand


who
 you
 are
 what
 you're
 great
 at
 what


you're
 not
 great
 at
 and
 how
 you're
 going


to
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 fill
 in
 the
 gaps


to
 make
 it
 so
 that
 you
 can
 deliver
 great


things
 the
 second
 thing
 is
 um
 curiosity


you
 know
 constant
 curiosity
 it
 is
 a
 fast


moving
 world
 out
 there
 technology
 is


moving
 F
 at
 a
 faster
 Pace
 than
 ever


before
 the
 capital
 markets
 are


constantly
 evolving
 and
 if
 you're
 not


intellectually
 curious
 you're
 going
 to


get
 stuck
 in
 a
 box
 pretty
 quickly
 and


that's
 not
 and
 and
 and
 you
 might
 stick


us
 in
 a
 box
 and
 that
 that
 is
 not
 where


we
 want
 to
 go
 so
 constant
 curiosity
 and


then
 of
 course
 um
 whatever
 the
 expertise


that
 we're
 driving
 that
 we're
 asking
 for


is
 is
 I
 think
 table
 Stakes
 of
 course
 to


to
 the
 role
 but
 then
 the
 last
 thing
 is


kindness
 and
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 how
 do
 you


work
 really
 well
 in
 with
 in
 groups
 how


do
 you
 make
 it
 so
 that
 you
 manage
 by


influence
 you
 lead
 by
 influence
 so
 that


you
 get
 more
 done
 than
 your
 job
 would


necessarily
 entail
 do
 you
 think
 kind


kindness
 is
 underrated
 in
 this
 Society
 I


think
 that
 there's
 a
 reputation
 within


certain
 industries
 that
 that
 would
 be


Thea
 that
 that
 um
 kind
 kindness
 is
 a


weakness
 I
 think
 kindness
 is
 a
 strength


uh
 you
 know
 our
 business
 we
 are


technology
 business
 but
 we
 are
 founded


on
 the
 on
 the
 notion
 of
 relationships
 I


always
 say
 that
 even
 in
 the
 trading


business
 where
 it
 is
 a
 very
 analytical


decision
 as
 to
 whether
 we
 go
 first
 in


your
 routing
 tables
 or
 not
 that


relationships
 break
 ties
 and
 so
 at
 the


very
 least
 relationships
 break
 ties
 but


at
 the
 most
 they
 drive
 trust
 and
 if
 you


are
 the
 trusted
 provider
 clients


naturally
 want
 to
 do
 more
 with
 you
 and


that
 trust
 is
 the
 most
 important
 thing


that
 you
 can
 gain
 gain
 and
 I
 think


kindness
 is
 a
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 building


that
 trust
 I
 think
 I
 think
 the
 concept


of
 kindness
 is
 quite
 funny
 because
 when


you
 are
 20
 the
 cool
 people
 they
 were
 not


kind
 they
 were
 the
 least
 kind
 okay
 and


so
 nobody
 wanted
 to
 be
 kind
 because
 then


you
 were
 just
 like
 a
 loser
 now
 you
 fast


forward
 until
 you're
 50
 and
 if
 I
 were
 to


if
 I
 were
 to
 pick
 one
 trait
 which
 I


would
 really
 love
 to
 have
 in
 my
 you
 know


partner
 or
 colleague
 it's
 kindness
 of


course
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


kindness
 is
 generally
 a
 reflection
 of


confidence
 too


and
 and
 I
 think
 those
 things
 go
 hand
 in


glove
 with
 each
 other
 um
 and
 I
 you
 know


at
 the
 end
 that's
 what
 you're
 looking


for
 is
 that
 kind
 of
 kind
 confident


humble
 leader
 um
 person
 who
 can
 relate


to
 other
 people
 who
 can
 get
 the
 most
 out


of
 another
 person
 and
 who
 cares
 about


those
 other
 people
 and
 their
 success


that's
 a
 great
 leader
 and
 that's
 what
 we


look
 for
 you
 mentioned
 that
 Curiosity


was
 uh
 uh
 a
 key
 thing
 that
 you
 were


looking
 for
 what
 are
 you
 curious
 about


these
 days
 everything
 related
 to
 the


future
 of
 technology
 everything
 are
 you


curious
 about
 anything
 non-technology


related
 uh
 oh
 yeah
 I
 mean
 so
 I
 when
 I


was
 in
 college
 I
 was
 a
 political
 science


major
 so
 and
 I
 really
 studied
 actually
 I


I
 was
 my
 my
 concentration
 was
 in
 Soviet


studies
 so
 so
 international
 relations


what's
 happening
 in
 the
 world
 how
 do
 how


do
 how
 do
 Nations
 come
 together
 or
 fall


apart
 how
 do
 they
 how
 do
 they
 drive


their
 economies
 forward
 what
 are
 the


ingredients
 for
 a
 successful
 economy
 a


successful
 Society
 I
 care
 deeply
 about


that
 and
 I'm
 very
 curious
 about
 that
 you


also
 have
 a
 black
 belt
 in
 Korea
 in


kickboxing
 um
 well
 well


done
 um
 is
 there
 anything
 from
 that


sport
 that
 you
 have
 taken
 into
 business


oh
 definitely
 um
 like
 what
 well
 first
 is


the
 training
 part
 of
 ta
 kundo
 which
 is


Korean
 kickboxing
 is
 the
 in
 my
 opinion


the
 fun
 part
 you
 know
 the
 part
 that's


hard
 but
 fun
 the
 sparring
 part
 of
 of
 uh


taond
 do
 is
 the
 scary
 part
 and
 but
 at


the
 same
 time
 you
 have
 to
 put
 yourself


in
 a
 position
 where
 you
 have
 to
 overcome


fear
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 as
 a
 person


I
 think
 it's
 important
 as
 a
 leader
 that


you
 that
 you
 put
 yourself
 in
 a
 position


to
 overcome
 fear
 and
 taon
 do
 is
 very


good
 at
 that
 because
 I
 was
 very
 fearful


of
 uh
 of
 sparring
 the
 second
 thing
 is


the
 need
 to
 play
 offense
 and
 defense
 all


the
 time
 it's
 like
 chess
 and
 I
 think


chess
 is
 also
 another
 great
 skill
 to


have
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 a
 business


leader
 because
 you
 always
 have
 to


remember
 every
 offensive
 move
 requires
 a


defensive
 move
 at
 the
 same
 time
 so
 in


and
 sparring
 you
 can
 learn
 that
 really


the
 hard
 way
 because
 you
 get
 all
 excited


you're
 about
 to
 kick
 someone
 in
 the
 head


and
 feels
 great
 and
 then
 they
 just
 punch


you
 in
 the
 gut
 you
 know
 so
 you
 have
 to


make
 sure
 that
 as
 you
 are
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 how
 to
 position
 yourself
 to


do
 the
 offensive
 move
 that
 you're
 not


leaving
 yourself
 exposed
 offensively
 so


that
 those
 are
 the
 two
 things
 that
 I


learn
 a
 lot
 about
 do
 you
 have
 fear
 I
 do


I
 mean
 well
 every
 person
 has
 fear
 I
 do


not
 come
 into
 the
 job
 with
 fear
 um
 I
 I


had
 enough
 experiences
 in
 my
 early


career
 not
 everybody
 has
 called
 fear


yeah
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 would
 say
 that
 I
 had
 a


lot
 of
 experiences
 early
 in
 my
 career


where
 I
 had
 to
 overcome
 that
 sense
 of


fear
 you
 know
 to
 kind
 of
 how
 am
 I
 going


to
 prove
 myself
 how
 I'm
 going
 to
 make


sure
 that
 this
 is
 successful
 that
 when
 I


got
 the
 job
 as
 CEO
 I
 felt
 extremely


ready
 and
 in
 the
 job
 as
 CEO
 you
 don't


feel
 fear
 I
 mean
 you
 have
 moments
 of


making
 sure
 that
 you
 manage
 through


challenging
 situations
 but
 all
 of
 the


experience
 that
 led
 up
 to
 that
 gets
 you


prepared
 for
 that
 so
 I
 don't
 walk
 around


with
 fear
 but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 it's


couple
 of
 um
 cosos
 have
 spoken
 to
 you


know
 on
 these
 podcast
 like
 Bob
 Iger
 and


Disney
 and
 and
 also
 Michael
 Dell
 uh
 they


say
 that
 they
 haven't
 got
 the
 fear
 again


gen
 well
 I
 can't
 say
 I
 would
 say
 that
 I


have
 a
 healthy
 fur
 Gene
 but
 the
 most


important
 thing
 you
 can
 do
 is
 train


yourself
 to
 overcome
 it
 now
 how
 do
 you


relax
 apart
 from
 kickboxing
 uh
 well
 my


husband
 um
 his
 profession
 is
 he's
 a


pottery
 instructor
 uh
 he
 was
 a
 lawyer


for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 then
 had
 a
 second


career
 as
 a
 pottery
 instructor
 so
 he
 is


he's
 taught
 me
 potteries
 which
 is
 have


you
 got
 like
 a
 a
 wheel
 at
 home
 like
 we


do
 so
 we
 have
 a
 small
 Studio
 at
 home
 we


go
 on
 Saturdays
 and
 we'll
 we'll
 throw


pots
 and
 he
 teaches
 me
 he's
 very
 good


and
 I'm
 very
 bad
 but
 um
 but
 it's
 a
 very


relaxing
 way
 for
 us
 to
 spend
 time


together
 we
 also
 play
 a
 lot
 of
 pickle


ball
 um
 and
 we
 we
 play
 that


competitively
 so
 we
 have
 a
 good
 time


with
 that
 very
 good
 um
 now
 finally
 we


got
 um
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 young
 people


uh
 listening
 to
 this
 what
 what
 is
 your


advice
 to
 them
 I
 would
 say
 first
 always


stay
 curious
 um
 always
 you
 know
 make


sure
 that
 you
 when
 you
 have
 the


opportunity
 to
 say
 yes
 you
 say
 yes
 you


know
 early
 in
 my
 career
 I
 was
 asked
 to


do
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 were
 outside
 the
 scho


of
 my
 job
 and
 I
 would
 always
 just
 say


okay
 I'll
 do
 that
 and
 then
 you
 go
 back


to
 your
 office
 and
 you
 go
 hm
 I
 wonder


how
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 that
 but
 you
 know


you
 have
 to
 figure
 it
 out
 and
 that's
 the


great
 thing
 if
 someone's
 trusting
 you
 to


give
 you
 that
 projects
 they
 think
 that


you're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 figure
 it
 out


so
 take
 it
 um
 now
 if
 you
 take
 say
 yes
 to


too
 many
 things
 then
 you
 need
 to
 sit


down
 and
 say
 okay
 how
 do
 I
 prioritize


these
 things
 but
 the
 fact
 of
 the
 matter


is
 say
 yes
 and
 stay
 curious
 well
 Alina


you
 for
 sure
 have
 figured
 out
 NASDAQ


well
 done
 and
 congratulations
 thank
 you


very
 much
 it's
 great
 to
 spend
 time
 you


thank
 you
