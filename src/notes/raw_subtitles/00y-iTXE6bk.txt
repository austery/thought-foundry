Hi
 everyone,
 I'm
 Nicola
 Tangan,
 the
 CEO


of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth
 Fund


and
 today
 I'm
 in
 really
 good
 company


with
 Emma
 Wsley,
 the
 CEO
 of
 GSK,
 one
 of


the
 global
 leaders
 in


pharmaceuticals.
 Now,
 we
 own
 1.7%
 of
 GSK


valued
 at$
 1.3
 billion
 US.
 Emma,
 great


to
 have
 you
 here.
 Wonderful
 to
 be
 here.


Thanks
 for
 having
 and
 I
 believe
 this
 is


the
 second
 podcast
 ever
 in
 your
 life.


Second
 ever.
 Wow.
 Looking
 forward
 very


much
 to
 the
 conversation.
 Very
 good.


Now,
 which
 areas
 of
 research
 excites
 you


the
 most
 just
 now?
 Uh,
 well,
 I'm
 excited


about
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 ways
 that
 research


both
 in
 science
 and
 technology
 are


advancing
 and
 particularly
 those
 two


things
 together.
 I
 mean,
 it
 is
 literally


the
 point
 of
 our
 company
 is
 to
 innovate


and
 that's
 where
 we
 allocate
 most
 of
 our


capital.
 So
 in
 fact
 since
 I've
 been
 in


this
 job
 I
 think
 we've
 nearly
 doubled


our
 R&D
 spend
 uh
 organically
 and
 then
 of


course
 opened
 up
 huge
 amounts
 of


partnerships
 that
 we
 do
 externally
 and


business
 development
 to
 supplement
 the


pipeline.
 What
 excites
 me
 most
 uh
 is


when
 we
 can
 innovate
 in
 a
 way
 that
 has


real
 impact
 at
 scale
 for
 patients
 around


the
 world.
 So
 I'm
 incredibly
 excited


about
 five
 new
 approvals
 for
 new
 drugs


and
 vaccines
 that
 we're
 expecting
 to
 get


this
 year.
 One
 down
 and
 another
 four
 uh


to
 go.
 And
 that's
 the
 first
 wave
 of
 a


cohort
 of
 we
 think
 14
 scale
 medicines


and
 vaccines
 each
 with
 the
 potential
 of


more
 than
 two
 billion
 pounds
 worth
 of


sales
 that
 we
 expect
 to
 launch
 this


decade
 and
 that
 includes
 uh
 in
 areas
 of


oncology
 in
 infectious
 diseases
 in


respiratory
 uh
 immunology
 in
 HIV
 and
 you


know
 some
 of
 these
 what's
 really


exciting
 is
 when
 you
 have
 totally
 new


technology
 platforms
 in
 pharmaceuticals.


So
 for
 example
 um
 in
 multiple
 myoma
 uh


very
 nasty
 blood
 cancer
 that
 uh
 where


there
 are
 180,000
 new
 diagnoses
 every


year.
 We
 have
 a
 new
 technology
 platform


something
 called
 antibbody
 drug


conjugates
 and
 you
 have
 to
 think
 of


these
 as
 like
 kind
 of
 biological


missiles
 that
 have
 precision
 targeting


for
 cancer
 which
 means
 they
 can
 bring


greater
 efficacy
 uh
 but
 also
 with
 less


side
 effects.
 So
 we
 hopefully
 have
 a
 new


multiple
 myoma
 drug
 uh
 that
 has
 data


that
 proves
 it
 extends
 life
 expectancy


by
 3
 years.
 That's
 a
 very
 big
 deal
 for


these
 um
 uh
 patients
 in
 terms
 of
 uh


overall
 survival
 uh
 in
 that
 new
 uh


platform
 technology.
 Um
 another
 example


of
 something
 totally
 new
 in
 emerging


science
 is
 in
 a
 field
 called


oligoucleotides.


um
 you
 have
 to
 think
 of
 these
 as
 a
 kind


of
 spell
 check
 for
 RNA
 expression
 to


correct
 the
 way
 uh
 disease
 develops
 and


there
 we
 may
 have
 a
 new
 functional
 cure


for
 a
 horrible
 disease
 hepatitis
 B
 um


which
 impacts
 250
 million
 people
 around


the
 world.
 So
 these
 are
 examples
 of
 new


nearterm
 assets.
 You
 are
 both
 in


vaccines
 and
 in
 medicines
 and
 how
 do


these
 areas
 complement
 each
 other?
 Well,


vaccines
 are
 there
 fundamentally


uh
 to
 prevent
 disease
 before
 it
 starts.


And
 you
 know,
 at
 GSK,
 we
 say
 we
 combine


science,
 tech,
 and
 talent
 to
 get
 ahead


of
 disease.
 Um
 there
 is
 no
 better
 return


on
 investment
 uh
 than
 vaccine


technology.
 In
 fact,
 in
 healthcare


perhaps
 except
 for
 clean
 water,
 um
 it's


really
 is,
 you
 know,
 a
 very
 powerful
 uh


solution
 uh
 mainly
 in
 infectious


diseases.
 But
 you
 talk
 about
 what's


exciting
 and
 new
 science
 coming
 through.


A
 couple
 of
 weeks
 ago,
 I
 was
 in
 Oxford


looking
 um
 with
 some
 part
 in
 a


partnership
 we've
 uh
 developed
 there
 to


look
 at
 precancer
 cell
 um
 biology
 and


that
 is
 potentially
 we're
 really
 looking


on
 long-term
 horizons
 in
 terms
 of


exciting
 science
 here
 to
 imagine
 what


cancer
 vaccines
 uh
 could
 bring.
 Um
 and


you
 know
 that's
 very
 uh
 exciting
 science


when
 you
 talk
 about
 um
 uh
 the


complimentarity.
 Obviously
 when
 you're


in
 medicines
 you
 tend
 to
 be
 more
 in
 the


treatment
 space.
 Um
 but
 that
 can
 also
 be


earlier
 intervention
 in
 disease
 to


change
 its
 course
 because
 what
 costs


money
 for
 society
 and
 health
 care


systems
 is
 hospitalization
 and
 spending


on
 people
 being
 sick.
 So
 intervening


earlier
 um
 is
 really
 important
 and
 that


can
 be
 with
 long
 acting
 medicines
 that


keep
 people
 out
 of
 hospital
 and
 we
 have


lots
 in
 our
 pipeline
 uh
 be
 it
 in
 HIV
 or


respiratory
 that's
 looking
 at
 that
 too.


For
 the
 people
 who
 don't
 know
 GSK
 what


are
 your
 three
 bestselling
 products?


Well
 our
 biggest
 sellers
 uh
 are
 um
 in
 uh


HIV
 in
 respiratory
 drugs
 uh
 and
 in
 uh


vaccines
 today.
 So
 uh
 in
 respiratory
 if


you
 look
 at
 a
 drug
 called
 trilogy
 and


that's
 for
 both
 asthma
 and
 COPD
 chronic


obstructive
 pulmonary
 disease.
 Perhaps


many
 haven't
 heard
 of
 it
 but
 it's
 the


third
 leading
 cause
 of
 death
 in
 the


world.
 It's
 the
 I
 think
 300
 million


people
 living
 with
 that.
 And
 so
 we
 have


an
 everyday
 inhaler
 for
 both
 COPD
 and
 a


asthma
 called
 trilogy
 because
 it's
 got


three
 drugs
 in
 it.
 That's
 a
 huge
 one.
 In


HIV
 we
 have
 two
 drug
 regimens.
 I
 mean,


remember,
 you
 know,


I
 an
 HIV
 diagnosis
 used
 to
 be
 a
 death


sentence.
 Now,
 it's
 something
 that
 you


can
 uh
 live
 with
 as
 a
 chronic
 disease


because
 we
 have
 these
 fantastic
 uh
 drugs


that
 that
 um
 uh
 that
 people
 can
 take
 and


integr
 have have
 been
 pioneering
 in
 long


acting
 solutions
 in
 HIV.
 So,
 that
 means


an
 injection
 you
 can
 take
 six
 times
 a


year.
 We're
 now
 looking
 at
 it
 being
 four


times
 a
 year
 and
 eventually
 a
 couple
 of


times
 a
 year.
 That's
 an
 extraordinary
 uh


uh
 solution.
 And
 then
 in
 in
 vaccines,
 we


really
 pioneered
 with
 an
 incredibly


effective
 shingles
 vaccine.
 That's
 a


multi-billion
 asset
 uh
 today.
 Uh
 gives


90%
 protection
 for
 at least
 11
 years.


You
 know,
 one
 in
 three
 of
 us.
 Uh
 so
 your


camera
 woman
 or
 you
 or
 me,
 we're
 going


to
 deal
 with
 uh
 shingles
 um
 uh
 at
 some


stage
 incredibly
 painful
 and
 we
 have a


highly
 effective
 vaccines
 there.
 And


then
 another
 example
 would
 be
 we
 had
 the


world's
 first
 RSV
 vaccine
 uh
 uh
 that
 we


launched
 last
 year
 still
 only
 in
 its


very
 early
 stage
 of
 of
 global


penetration.
 So
 those
 are
 the
 big
 ones


today.
 But
 for
 the
 future,
 I
 think
 we're


looking
 more
 and
 more
 towards
 cancer
 uh


drugs
 as
 well.
 You've
 kind
 of
 overseen
 a


major
 overhaul
 of
 your
 R&D
 uh
 approach


since
 you
 became
 the
 CEO.
 So
 what
 are


the
 biggest
 changes
 you
 made
 to
 that


process?
 Well,
 I
 think
 these
 this


process
 is
 always
 uh
 uh
 ongoing
 because


as
 I
 said
 at
 the
 beginning,
 you
 know,


the
 purpose
 of
 our
 company
 is
 to


innovate
 and
 we're
 one
 of
 the
 only


industries
 that
 has
 to
 literally
 replace


itself
 every
 decade
 um
 because
 of
 the


patent
 model
 um
 which
 is
 in
 place.
 And


you
 know
 the
 first
 thing
 to
 do
 was


simply
 to
 say
 we
 want
 to
 prioritize
 it


and
 put
 really
 uh
 organize
 ourselves
 to


prioritize
 the
 allocation
 of
 capital
 to


R&D.
 We
 had
 um
 a
 radical
 overhaul
 of
 the


key
 uh
 disease
 areas
 that
 we
 wanted
 to


go
 into.
 So
 we
 explicitly
 said
 we're


going
 to
 prioritize
 specialty
 medicines


and
 uh
 vaccines
 within
 the
 port
 uh


portfolio
 and
 within
 that
 are
 key


therapy
 areas.
 We
 bet
 back
 big
 in
 cancer


both
 through
 business
 development
 um


acquisitions
 in
 licensing
 and
 homegrown


innovation
 as
 well.
 I've
 been
 really


excited
 to
 see
 that
 business
 more
 than


double
 last
 year.
 is
 still
 emerging
 but


I
 think
 when
 we
 look
 forward
 to
 the


pipeline
 that's
 coming
 next
 um
 uh
 be
 it


the
 multiple
 myoma
 approval
 we
 hope
 to


get
 this
 year
 or
 a
 whole
 new
 portfolio


of
 uh
 ADCs
 these
 antibbody
 uh
 body
 drug


conjugates
 which
 we
 think
 will
 open
 up


solutions
 to
 new
 areas
 of
 cancer
 I
 mean


this
 is
 as
 you
 know
 and
 you
 very
 kindly


brought
 um
 you
 very
 kindly
 brought


forward
 this
 recording
 because
 I'm
 going


from
 this
 meeting
 to
 the
 funeral
 of
 a


friend
 who
 died
 of
 pancreatic
 cancer.


She
 was
 in
 her
 early
 50s,
 mom
 of
 three.


More
 and
 more
 we're
 seeing
 uh
 diagnosis


in
 younger
 people
 um
 uh
 uh
 for
 cancer.


And
 although
 the
 science
 is
 advancing
 so


fast
 here
 uh
 with
 new
 uh


modalities,
 we've
 still
 got
 diseases


like
 lung
 cancer
 where
 even
 the
 biggest


drugs
 in
 the
 world
 are
 only
 effective
 on


20%
 of
 of
 the
 population.
 So
 um
 I
 think


you
 know
 there's
 a
 lot
 lot
 more
 work
 uh


to
 do
 there.
 It's
 one
 of
 our
 areas
 of


our
 portfolio.
 The
 other
 incredible


transformation
 that
 is
 coming
 to
 R&D
 and


our
 industry
 and
 frankly
 the
 healthcare


industry
 writ
 large
 is
 what's
 going
 to


be
 done
 with
 technology.
 Exactly.
 And


that's
 and
 you
 are
 and
 you
 are
 on
 the


board
 of
 Microsoft
 correct
 privilege


that
 that
 is
 and
 have
 been
 for
 six


years.
 What
 are
 you
 taking
 from


Microsoft
 into
 the
 processes?
 Well,


first
 of
 all,
 um,
 just
 to
 reiterate,


obviously
 my
 core
 job
 in
 accountability


is
 as
 the
 CEO
 of
 GSK.
 Yeah,
 sure.
 But
 I


mean
 I
 mean,
 normally
 I
 I'm
 a
 bit


skeptical
 when
 people
 are
 on
 on
 boards,


right?
 This
 is
 hugely
 useful.
 But
 this


Well,
 exactly.
 So
 here
 you
 can
 just
 see


it,
 right?
 It
 should
 really
 enable
 you


to
 bring
 in
 new
 technologies
 and
 be


totally
 cutting
 edge.
 I
 I
 believe
 we


should
 all
 be
 on
 the
 board
 of
 Microsoft.


I
 wish
 I
 wish
 I
 were.
 I
 would
 love
 to.
 F


first
 of
 all
 uh
 it's
 very
 interesting


the
 uh
 crossovers
 what
 are
 what
 are
 just


let's
 just
 before
 you
 get
 into
 the


obvious
 relevance
 of
 the
 fact
 that


technology
 AI
 now
 gen
 AI
 are
 going
 to


change
 every
 industry
 and
 society
 and


it's
 the
 most
 exciting
 time
 we
 can


possibly
 imagine
 especially
 when
 you


consider
 a
 third
 of
 the
 world's
 data
 is


related
 to
 healthcare
 and
 healthcare
 is


one
 of
 the
 biggest
 challenges
 in
 terms


of
 its
 sustainability
 its
 affordability


and
 the
 enormous
 amount
 of
 unmet
 need


there
 is
 out
 there
 when
 you
 think
 about


aging
 populations
 and
 the
 rest
 in
 fact


there
 isn't
 a
 single
 tech
 company
 that


doesn't
 think
 that
 the
 best
 case
 study


for
 the
 the
 possibilities
 of
 technology


and
 its
 positive
 contribution
 to
 society


is
 healthcare
 writ
 large
 what
 is
 most


exciting
 for
 GSK
 is
 our
 biggest


challenge
 is
 the
 productivity
 of
 R&D
 it


is
 really
 really
 hard
 to
 uh
 discuss


cover
 and
 develop
 a
 drug.
 90%
 of
 um
 and


this
 is
 industry
 large
 90%
 of
 uh
 the


assets
 uh
 fail
 which
 by
 the
 is
 an


important
 thing
 when
 you
 think
 about
 the


economic
 model
 of
 our
 industry
 and


having
 to
 cover
 the
 cost
 of
 failure.
 It


takes
 a
 decade
 and
 it
 can
 cost
 billions.


Uh
 so
 capital
 allocation
 is
 a
 very
 very


important
 thing
 for
 us
 to
 do.
 But
 just


imagine


um
 in
 this
 world
 of
 the
 explosion
 of


data,
 genetics
 and
 genomics
 and
 health


care
 systems
 um
 uh
 provision
 and
 new


tech,
 wearable
 tech,
 how
 every
 aspect
 of


the
 value
 chain
 uh
 for
 us
 in
 R&D
 and
 we


think
 of
 that
 if
 you
 looked
 at
 the


traditional
 linear
 mode,
 you
 would
 say


target
 selection,
 so
 biological
 target


selection,
 molecule
 design,


uh
 what
 we
 call
 CMC.
 So
 the
 transition


of
 that
 into
 manufacturing
 because


that's
 often
 can
 be
 you
 know
 especially


with
 all
 these
 new
 technology
 platforms


it
 can
 be
 uh
 an
 area
 where
 you
 can
 get


bottlenecks
 or
 a
 failure
 rate
 and
 then


you
 get
 into
 clinical
 trials
 where


things
 get
 really
 expensive.
 Um
 and


patient
 identification
 is
 a
 part
 of


that.
 So
 we've
 traditionally
 gone


through
 a
 linear
 mode
 and
 each
 one
 of


those
 today
 we
 are
 using
 AI
 and


sometimes
 gen
 AI
 whether
 it's
 um
 to
 uh


get
 more
 precision
 around
 the


probability
 of
 success
 about
 the


original
 biological
 target
 and
 we're


using
 genetic
 data
 as
 well
 and
 we
 have


examples
 of
 that
 whether
 it's
 about


building
 completely
 industry-leading


chemistry
 libraries
 to
 allow
 us
 to


design
 molecules
 in
 silicone
 and
 again


that
 work
 is
 going
 on.
 We're
 not
 it's


that
 famous
 quote
 about
 you
 know
 the


future
 here
 is
 here
 but
 it's
 not
 scaled


and
 evenly
 distributed
 yet
 still
 in
 the


sort
 of
 uh
 early
 stages
 of
 doing
 these


experimentation
 but
 there's
 a
 lot
 so


when
 you
 see
 how
 you've
 used
 um


technology
 and
 how
 you
 use
 AI
 what
 has


it
 done
 for
 you
 so
 far
 and
 how
 much
 more


improvement
 will
 there
 be
 oh
 I
 think
 I


think
 we've
 hardly
 scratched
 the
 surface


we're
 already
 using
 it
 in
 the
 design
 of


our
 clinicals
 trials
 to
 predict
 outcomes


to
 be
 able
 to
 follow
 uh
 patterns
 of


infectious
 diseases
 So
 what
 do
 you
 think


it
 would
 do
 let's
 say
 over
 the
 next
 5


years?
 What
 will
 it
 do
 and
 how
 and
 how


will
 you
 measure
 it?
 Um
 well
 we
 will


measure
 it
 in
 the
 performance
 of
 the


discovery
 and
 development
 uh
 process.
 Um


it
 will
 uh
 reduce
 cost,
 reduce
 time
 and


ideally
 allow
 us
 to


target
 labels
 for
 the
 medicines
 and


vaccines
 that
 we
 have.
 So
 are
 they
 the


descriptions
 of
 their
 benefits?
 Because


we
 can
 design
 trials
 in
 a
 more
 precise


way
 for
 patients
 that
 are
 specifically


targeted.
 So
 you
 can
 get
 a


disproportionate
 benefit.
 I
 give
 you
 two


examples.
 Uh
 um
 I
 talked
 about
 um
 uh


three
 examples.
 I
 talked
 about
 hepatitis


B
 which
 is
 this
 huge
 disease
 that


impacts
 250
 million
 people.
 But
 there


are
 very
 different
 profiles
 within
 that.


By
 being
 able
 to
 do
 um
 uh
 much
 more


precision
 uh
 profiling
 phenotyping
 of


patients,
 we're
 then
 able
 to
 design


clinical
 trials
 to
 show
 a


disproportionate


um
 uh
 impact
 on
 a
 smaller
 cohort,
 not


all
 of
 them,
 so
 that
 you
 can
 then
 get
 to


what
 we
 call
 a
 functional
 cure
 as
 in


people
 can
 then
 live
 with
 the
 disease


more
 normally.
 Our
 early
 trials
 are


showing
 that.
 We're
 going to
 have


readouts
 of
 phase
 three
 as
 well.
 That


would
 be
 one
 example.
 Another
 would
 be


when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 biomarkers
 around


um
 different
 cancer
 types.
 So
 in


um
 colurectal
 uh
 cancer
 from
 learnings


we
 did
 in
 endometrial
 cancer
 actually
 we


looked
 at
 a
 particular
 um
 uh
 genetic


marker
 called
 DMMR
 um
 which
 uh
 allowed


us
 to
 be
 much
 more
 precise
 on
 the


targeting
 in
 in
 in
 in
 cancer
 and
 then


have
 trials
 where
 we've
 had
 them
 in
 the


early
 stages
 100%
 success
 rates
 which


has
 allow
 us
 to
 then
 go
 into
 at
 risk


phase
 uh
 three
 trials.
 Another
 example


would
 be
 we
 accelerated
 our
 RSV
 vaccine


and
 this
 is
 a
 simpler
 one.
 Accelerated


our
 RSV
 vaccine
 um
 uh
 outcomes
 by
 two


years
 because
 we
 were
 able
 to
 look
 at


the
 infectious
 disease
 patterns
 in


different
 parts
 of
 the
 globe
 uh
 and
 call


the
 closure
 of
 clinical
 trials
 earlier


and
 we've
 got
 a
 vaccine
 that
 has
 over


90%
 efficacy
 on
 those
 that
 represent
 90%


of
 the
 hospitalization.
 So
 at
 the
 moment


these
 are
 spot
 examples.
 Do
 you
 think
 it


will
 improve
 the
 hit
 rate?
 Um
 yes


without
 with
 which
 to
 bring
 the
 early


stage
 breakthroughs
 without
 any
 and


that's
 the
 most
 important
 fact.
 In
 fact,


I
 think
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 do,
 I
 think


this
 five
 years,
 I'd
 say
 definitely


within
 10
 years,
 and
 I
 hope
 we'll
 have


more
 and
 more
 examples
 along
 that
 way,


but
 instead
 of
 having
 this
 linear


process,
 we're
 going
 to
 move
 to
 more
 of


a
 lab
 in
 a
 loop,
 which
 is
 an
 overused


term,


but
 you
 actually
 get
 into
 reverse


translation,
 patient
 back,
 um,
 uh,


rather
 than
 target
 out,
 so
 that
 we
 can


get
 to,
 frankly,
 um
 faster,
 better


outcomes
 with
 more
 precise
 targeting
 for


for
 patient
 cohorts.
 But
 Emma,
 um
 aren't


all
 pharmaceutical
 companies
 doing
 this?


I
 hope
 so.
 Absolutely.
 I
 mean,
 I
 hope
 I


hope
 they
 do
 it.
 I
 mean,
 if
 not,
 I
 think


you
 need
 to
 be
 pretty
 thick.
 But
 the


thing
 is
 that
 what
 is
 this
 going
 to
 do


to
 the
 competitive
 landscape?
 Well,
 what


I
 hope
 I
 mean,
 Nico,
 let's
 just
 step


back.
 In
 the
 end,
 our


job
 is
 to
 meet
 the
 enormous
 amount
 of


unmet
 need
 there
 is
 out
 there
 in
 the


world


and
 most
 of
 what
 we
 do
 doesn't
 work.
 I


think
 it
 is
 a
 wonderful
 thing
 if
 this


industry
 that
 frankly
 has,
 you
 know,
 too


many
 negative
 Netflix
 movies
 made
 out


about
 it
 is
 able
 to
 show
 the
 world
 uh


what
 science
 and
 technology
 combined
 can


do
 for
 good.
 We
 still
 have
 so
 many


diseases
 that
 don't
 have
 uh
 solutions


around
 the
 world.
 You
 know,
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 ones,
 the
 most
 exciting
 area
 for


science
 I
 think
 for
 the
 long
 term
 or
 we


don't
 have
 good
 solutions
 in
 is
 is
 in


everything
 to
 do
 with
 neurodeeneration,


dementia
 and
 Alzheimer's.
 the
 trajectory


of
 disease
 is
 going
 to
 change
 hugely
 I


think
 over
 the
 next
 10
 or
 20
 years
 if


you
 imagine
 that
 metabolic
 disorders


that
 are
 going
 to
 be
 I
 think
 you
 know
 um


and
 their
 squelli
 because
 of
 what's


going
 on
 in
 these
 amazing
 discoveries
 in


the
 obesity
 drugs
 is
 going
 to
 be
 less
 of


a
 burden
 but
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 triple


the
 number
 of
 over
 80s
 in
 20
 years
 time


than
 we
 have
 today
 and
 you
 know
 I'm


afraid
 like
 shingles
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 I'm


going
 to
 be
 there
 soon
 but
 well
 no
 but


of
 you're
 in
 our
 age
 group.
 Again,
 the


probability
 for
 all
 the
 brains
 in
 the


room,
 the
 probability
 of
 um
 of
 dementia


or
 Alzheimer's,
 I'm
 afraid,
 is
 again
 one


in
 three.
 Yeah.
 Absolutely.
 Absolutely.


We
 need
 the
 the
 the
 um
 introduction
 of


of
 increasing
 technologies
 into
 into
 R&D


and
 so
 on.
 Um
 are
 the
 US
 companies
 going


to
 be
 better
 positioned
 than
 the


Europeans?
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 that.
 I
 mean


we
 have
 some
 great
 European


um
 you
 know
 uh
 based
 farmer
 companies


with
 proud
 histories
 and
 strong


innovation
 and
 I
 think
 will
 be
 held
 back


by
 increased
 regulation
 and
 different


um
 different
 ways
 of
 looking
 at


technology
 AI
 and
 so
 on.
 The
 uh
 I
 would


say
 the
 first
 of
 all
 the
 um
 American


tech
 companies
 supply
 the
 world
 they


don't
 only
 supply
 uh
 the
 US.
 I
 do
 think


the
 question
 of
 regulation
 is
 important.


you
 you
 know
 you
 and
 we
 need
 uh
 growth


focused


regulation
 but
 honestly
 Nikolai
 I
 think


it's
 really
 important
 that
 we
 have


responsible
 regulation
 too
 on
 questions


like
 quality
 privacy


um
 security
 uh
 I
 think
 it's
 important


that
 Europe
 opens
 uh
 up
 uh
 the


possibilities
 um
 because
 we
 have
 strong


regulators
 in
 the
 EMA
 and
 the
 FDA
 and


the
 MH
 here
 in
 in in
 the
 UK
 Okay.
 Well,


we
 have
 to
 recognize
 the
 most
 important


thing
 we
 do
 is
 bring
 trusted,
 safe
 scale


solutions
 and
 patients
 are
 waiting.
 So,


what
 are
 you
 now
 seeing
 coming
 out
 of


China
 and
 India?
 a
 lot
 the
 share


of


firstinass
 drugs
 developed
 in
 China
 the


pace
 of


uh
 clinical
 development
 the
 pace
 of


innovation
 approval
 are
 all
 speeding
 up


a
 lot
 and
 we're
 doing
 quite
 a
 lot
 of


business
 development
 finding
 great


assets
 in
 China
 that
 you
 know
 want
 to
 um


export
 their
 drugs
 uh
 to
 to
 the
 world


now
 in
 the
 medical
 sector
 there's
 always


a
 trade-off
 between
 how
 you
 price
 your


drugs
 and
 the
 availability
 and


affordability
 Is
 you
 don't
 think
 there


is
 a
 trade-off?
 Well,
 I
 think
 they're


both
 there.
 I
 think
 there's
 occasionally


tensions,
 but
 I
 don't
 either.
 Tension


change.
 Is
 a
 t
 tension
 changing
 in
 any


way?
 Well,
 I
 don't
 see
 these
 as
 an


either
 or
 in
 any
 way.
 I
 think
 they
 are


structurally


they
 have
 to
 be
 an
 ant
 because
 you're


not
 innovating
 unless
 you
 do
 it
 at


scale.
 At
 GSK,
 we
 say
 we
 want
 to
 reach


two
 and
 a
 half
 billion
 people
 uh
 this


decade.
 It's
 one
 of the
 things
 that


differentiates
 uh
 us.
 I
 think
 there
 is


um
 is
 the
 scale
 of
 our
 impact
 relative


to
 our
 size.
 I
 think
 there
 is
 a
 huge


misunderstanding
 about
 the
 economics
 of


our
 industry
 in
 terms
 of


um
 the
 the
 the
 the
 pricing
 that
 is


required
 to
 cover
 the
 cost
 of
 failure


and
 the
 value
 that
 drugs
 and
 vaccines


bring
 to
 a
 health
 care
 system.
 And


remember
 what's
 expenses
 is
 treating


sick
 people
 and
 having
 them
 in
 hospital.


We
 all
 know
 an
 earlier
 diagnosis
 is


better,
 an
 earlier
 intervention
 is


better.
 So,
 so
 we
 need
 to
 value
 uh
 the


innovation
 and
 recognize
 that
 there
 are


so
 many
 diseases
 that
 don't
 have


solutions
 yet.
 But
 at
 the
 same


time,
 we
 have
 a
 social
 responsibility
 I


believe
 to
 drive
 access
 and
 there
 are


two
 billion
 people
 in
 the
 world
 that


don't
 have
 access
 to
 the
 health
 care


they
 need
 and
 it's
 not
 just
 a
 developing


country
 agenda.
 By
 the
 way,
 GSK
 has
 been


top
 of
 the
 access
 medicine
 or
 second
 to


the
 of
 the
 access
 to
 medicines
 index


every
 single
 year
 since
 it
 was
 founded.


Um
 and
 we're
 really
 proud
 of
 the
 work
 we


do
 with
 Gabby
 to
 provide
 tiered
 pricing


on
 vaccines
 with
 in
 HIV
 where
 of


the
 28
 million
 people
 that
 are
 on
 uh


these
 um
 integrated
 inhibitors
 23
 of


them
 are
 million
 of
 them
 in
 the
 world


mainly
 in
 in
 subsahara
 and
 Africa


because
 we
 opened
 up
 our
 IP
 to
 provide


uh
 those
 drugs
 there.
 So,
 so
 I
 think


it's
 not
 an
 either
 or,
 it
 is
 an
 and
 but.


But
 we
 have
 to
 do
 a
 better
 job
 of


communicating
 also
 about
 um
 you
 know
 the


business
 model
 um
 and
 the
 value
 that
 our


industry
 brings
 and
 take
 these


responsibilities
 in
 you
 know
 extremely


seriously
 and
 it's
 not
 just
 the


developing
 countries
 as
 you
 Nikolai
 I


mean
 you
 know
 in
 London
 between
 east


London
 and
 southwest
 London
 there's
 a


12year
 difference
 um
 between
 life


expectancy
 and
 in
 your
 beautiful
 country


you
 know
 access
 to
 medicines
 I
 checked


this
 um
 and
 was
 just
 looking
 at
 it


before
 coming
 here,
 but
 I
 think
 of
 the


278
 I
 think
 it
 was
 uh
 medicines
 uh
 this


is
 in
 2022
 that
 were
 centrally
 approved


in


Europe,
 40%
 of
 them
 are
 not
 yet


available
 in
 Norway.
 I'm
 just
 saying


that
 access
 is
 not
 simply
 a
 question
 of


what
 we're
 familiar
 with
 talking
 in


terms
 of
 aid
 to
 the
 poorest
 countries
 in


the
 world.
 in
 the
 richest
 countries
 in


the
 world
 sometimes
 it's
 getting


approvals
 uh
 on
 time
 and
 this
 is
 where


the
 US
 is
 definitely
 ahead
 definitely


ahead
 drilling
 down
 on
 vaccines
 uh
 now


you're
 a
 global
 leader
 in
 vaccines
 what


did
 we
 learn
 from
 co
 well
 a
 lot
 um
 top


three
 things
 uh
 older
 adult
 vaccination


uh
 is
 a
 really
 important


uh
 contribution
 to
 healthcare
 in
 society


a
 lot
 of
 us
 are
 used
 to
 vaccinating
 our


children
 and
 have
 been
 familiar
 with
 flu


vaccines,
 but
 you're
 seeing
 this
 opening


up
 of
 vaccine
 technology
 for
 older


adults.
 Supply
 chain
 security


geopolitically
 um
 is
 something
 that
 we


all
 have
 to
 be
 thoughtful
 about
 um
 and


certainly
 something
 that
 that
 GSK
 is


invested
 in
 uh
 you
 know
 very


aggressively
 in
 terms
 of
 regional
 supply


chains,
 not
 just
 um
 in
 vaccines
 but
 also


in
 in
 medicines.
 Last
 year
 we
 announced


another
 800
 million
 that
 we're
 spending


in
 in
 both
 medicine
 and
 vaccine
 um


manufacturing
 in
 the
 US.
 Uh
 we
 also
 have


strong
 European
 supply
 chains
 and
 we


have
 partnerships
 in
 China
 um
 for


distribution
 of
 vaccines.
 And
 then
 I


think
 the
 third
 thing
 if
 I'm
 only


allowed
 three
 although
 I
 could
 make
 the


list
 go
 on
 is
 um


you
 know
 we
 really
 have
 to
 watch
 out
 for


the
 questions
 of
 vaccines
 hesitancy


around
 the
 world
 and
 there's
 been
 a
 bit


of
 politicization
 of
 that
 specifically


through
 through
 co
 um
 but
 so
 how
 come
 so


how
 come
 that
 I
 mean
 vaccines
 got
 the


world
 back
 on
 its
 feet
 and
 then
 now


there
 is
 so
 much
 misinformation
 and


vaccine
 hesitancy
 and
 antivax
 and
 so
 on


just
 um
 why
 why
 is
 this
 let's
 remember


vaccines
 by
 definition
 are
 being
 given


to
 healthy
 children
 or
 adults
 it
 is


preventative
 care
 so
 you
 wake
 up
 in
 the


morning
 you're
 I
 I
 can
 remember
 I'm
 I'm


a
 mom
 of
 four
 I
 remember
 taking
 my
 brand


new
 babies
 by
 the
 which
 were
 born
 in
 I


have
 experience
 of
 three
 different


countries
 of
 giving
 giving
 birth
 and
 you


have
 different
 vaccine
 policies
 or
 it


felt
 like
 you
 did
 and
 you
 have
 these


questions
 I've
 got
 this
 precious
 newborn


what
 is
 this
 what
 am
 I
 giving
 them


what's
 it
 mean
 um
 and
 you
 want
 to
 have


information
 then
 I
 think
 obviously
 we


went
 through
 the
 global
 experience
 of


COVID
 which
 engendered
 um
 you
 know
 huge


pressure
 on
 the
 health
 care
 systems
 you


know
 a
 lot
 of
 national
 protectionism


tremendous
 energy
 around
 vaccines
 and
 a


focus
 on
 some
 brand
 new
 technologies


that
 had
 never
 been
 developed
 in


vaccines
 before
 and
 people
 had
 questions


about
 that.
 They
 had
 simultaneous
 fears


about
 the
 risks
 involved
 and
 the
 news


that
 was
 coming
 every
 day
 and
 then
 new


technologies
 that
 you
 know
 they
 were


being
 they
 wanted
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 they


could
 trust
 the
 communication
 about.
 So


it
 does
 come
 back
 to
 these
 questions
 of


trust
 and
 and
 what
 does
 do
 here?
 Well,


our
 answer
 is
 is
 what
 it
 has
 always


been.
 Okay,
 which
 is
 you
 start
 off
 by


saying
 if
 you
 have
 the


responsibility
 of
 as
 we
 do
 today,


frankly,
 vaccinating
 40%
 of
 the
 world's


children
 through
 our
 global
 programs
 and


a
 a
 pipeline
 of
 new
 vaccines,
 of


listening
 hard
 to
 people's
 questions,


communicating
 transparently,


underpinning
 everything
 with
 a
 100%


commitment
 to
 quality
 and
 safety
 and


trust
 in
 our
 products.
 uh
 and


remembering
 shouting
 trust
 us
 um
 you


know
 as
 a
 frankly
 a
 company
 that
 is
 a


public
 company
 with
 responsibilities
 to


shareholders
 and
 that
 has
 to
 generate


profits
 from
 these
 things
 is
 not
 the


most
 effective
 way.
 So
 we
 seek
 to


partner
 with
 governments
 to
 provide
 the


data
 and
 total
 transparency
 and
 to


frankly
 go
 to
 where
 people
 are
 with


their
 questions
 be
 it
 in
 the
 community


because
 that
 often
 is
 that
 um
 uh
 as
 well


but
 also
 not
 to
 lose
 sight
 of
 the
 fact


that
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 the
 US
 spends
 $9


billion
 a
 year
 on
 the
 hospitalization
 of


people
 from
 vaccines
 preventable


diseases.
 Um,
 so,
 you
 know,
 I
 think


we're
 working
 through
 an
 age
 where


people
 have
 questions
 and
 we
 just
 need


to
 calmly
 um
 continue
 to
 underpin
 our


work
 with
 uh,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 value


set
 that
 that
 we've
 been
 committed
 to


for
 generations
 uh,
 and
 and
 uh,
 keep


answering
 people's
 questions
 in
 it.
 Um,


Bill
 Gates
 wrote
 a
 book
 about
 how
 uh,


the
 next
 pandemic
 could
 be


uh,
 handled
 better
 by
 spending
 I
 think


it's
 roughly
 a
 billion
 dollars
 per
 year.


Yeah,
 but
 that's
 not
 happening.
 So
 why


are
 we
 not
 preparing
 ourselves
 better


for
 the
 next
 pandemic?
 Well,
 I
 think
 we


are
 actually
 at
 least
 inside
 the


industry.
 Although
 I
 agree
 with
 you
 that


you
 know
 memories
 feel
 a
 bit
 short,


don't
 they?
 Uh
 at
 the
 moment
 and
 the


challenges
 around
 this
 one
 is
 you're


trying
 to
 keep


capacity
 warm
 if
 I
 can
 say
 that.
 Um


uh
 now
 the
 reality
 is
 at
 GSK
 we
 have


contracts
 today
 with
 uh
 Europe,
 the
 US,


Canada
 around
 pandemic
 preparedness
 um


be
 it
 to
 be
 ready
 with
 our
 adivant
 or
 uh


and
 and
 and
 sort
 of
 prepandemic
 assets.


We
 have
 um
 you
 know
 uh
 some
 prioritized


reviews
 for
 preandemic
 uh
 flu
 vaccines


and
 in
 fact
 we're
 contracted
 also
 with


the
 WH
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 I
 think
 10%
 of


any
 ready
 supply
 would
 also
 be


immediately
 available
 um
 to
 uh
 you
 know


some
 of
 the
 more
 underdeveloped


countries
 in
 the
 world.
 So
 I
 would
 say


there
 is
 better
 preparation.
 Um
 we
 won't


be
 able
 to
 stop
 another
 pandemic
 coming


but
 I
 hope
 the
 world
 um
 yeah
 will
 will


remember
 uh
 and
 that
 we
 will
 mobilize


faster
 before
 such
 so
 many
 lives
 are


lost.
 But
 I'll
 tell
 you
 something
 else


that
 we
 are
 really
 thoughtful
 about
 at


GSK
 which
 is
 a
 different
 kind
 of


pandemic
 and
 where
 and
 that's
 um


sometimes
 referred
 to
 as
 the
 slow
 one


which
 is
 antimicrobial
 resistance
 which


will
 kill
 I
 think
 it's
 38
 million
 people


by
 2050
 unless
 we
 develop
 more


antibiotics
 and
 we
 have
 a
 very
 big


portfolio
 and
 pipeline
 uh
 here
 last
 year


we
 uh
 invested
 I
 think
 40
 million
 with


the
 um
 uh
 the
 Fleming
 work
 that's
 done


led
 out
 of
 the
 UK
 um
 with
 Imperial
 as


well
 to
 to
 try
 and
 research
 because
 this


is
 where
 the
 UK
 is
 very
 strong,
 right?


Well,
 it's
 got
 a
 proud
 history
 uh
 in
 AMR


and
 I
 think
 you
 know
 this
 is
 killing


people
 all
 over
 the
 world.
 It's
 a
 real


challenge
 in
 antibiotics
 because


obviously
 you're
 asking
 the
 industry
 to


develop
 drugs
 that
 you
 then
 don't
 want


to
 be
 over
 subscribed.
 Um
 so
 you
 know


we've
 we
 I'm
 actually
 one
 of
 the
 five


approvals
 I'm
 hoping
 to
 get
 this
 year
 is


for
 a
 brand
 new
 antibiotic
 in
 in
 um
 you


know
 the
 common
 uh
 very
 common
 for
 women


uh
 uh
 UTI
 uncomplicated
 UTI
 space.
 We


haven't
 had
 a
 new
 antibiotic
 for
 20


years.
 Um
 so
 uh
 you
 know
 I'm
 hopeful


we'll
 get
 that
 approved
 later
 this
 year.


You
 mentioned
 that
 uh
 I
 will
 soon
 going


to
 be
 80
 years
 old.
 Uh
 now
 um
 I
 didn't


mention
 that
 but
 yeah
 no
 um
 the
 elderly


uh
 need
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 vaccines
 right


flu
 covid
 shingles
 pneumonia


um
 when
 will
 we
 see
 a
 combination
 of
 all


these
 things
 into
 into
 one
 shot
 there


are
 there
 is
 ongoing
 work
 um
 on
 combo


vaccines
 from
 us
 and
 from
 others


uh
 we're
 used
 to
 having
 some
 combination


vaccines
 with
 pediatric
 vaccines


Um
 I
 think
 the
 thing
 you
 have
 to
 think


through
 is
 what
 is
 uh
 well
 it's
 not
 as


simple
 as
 just
 adding
 them
 together


obviously
 um
 but
 but
 you
 also
 have
 to


think
 through
 what
 the
 durability
 of


different
 vaccines
 is.
 So
 I'll
 give
 you


the
 example
 our
 RSV
 vaccine
 we
 now
 know


has
 that's
 a
 seasonal
 um
 uh
 respiratory


infection.
 We
 know
 we
 have
 protection


probably
 it
 will
 at
 least
 three
 years


maybe
 it
 will
 go
 up
 to
 five.
 So
 and
 flu


tends
 to
 be
 something
 that
 mutates


obviously
 every
 single
 year.
 So
 you
 know


you
 you
 have
 to
 think
 about
 what
 the


combinations
 would
 be
 when
 you're


providing
 a
 solution
 that
 is
 required
 on


an
 annual
 basis
 or
 you
 know
 more


extended
 like
 that.
 So
 it's
 it's
 a
 bit


more
 complicated.
 I
 think
 there
 are
 new


technology
 platforms
 that
 will
 um
 allow


more
 combinations
 potentially.
 So
 mRNA


is
 one
 that
 that
 we
 and
 others
 are
 are


looking
 at.
 Um
 uh
 but
 the
 science
 here


is
 quite
 complex.
 Um
 and
 again
 you
 want


to
 be
 in
 a
 place
 where
 you're
 looking
 at


both


efficacy
 and
 reacttogenicity
 as
 well
 to


see
 whether
 that
 combination
 is
 is
 is
 um


is
 going
 to
 be
 an
 effective
 solution.


But
 definitely
 something
 that's
 on
 the


horizon.
 Moving
 on
 a
 bit,
 you
 came
 into


uh
 GSK
 with
 a
 remmit
 of
 uh
 dramatically


change.
 Yes.
 The
 company.
 Yes.
 What
 are


what
 are
 some
 of
 the
 dramatic
 changes


you've
 you've
 done?
 Well,
 I
 don't
 know


whe
 the
 dramatic
 is
 the
 word
 that
 I'd


want
 to
 um
 uh
 use
 to
 describe
 it,
 but


certainly
 uh
 very
 significant
 change
 in


uh
 group


strategy,


structure,
 capital
 allocation,


um
 balance
 sheet,
 which
 was
 a
 major


challenge
 when
 we
 when
 we
 came
 in,
 which


is
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 we
 did
 the
 de


merger
 of
 Halen.
 I
 mean,
 I'd
 originally


joined.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 my
 my
 background


was
 in
 consumer
 goods.
 I
 moved
 from


China
 to
 London
 to
 uh
 build
 the
 consumer


division
 of
 GSK
 and
 we
 went
 through
 two


massive
 global
 joint
 ventures.
 Firstly


with
 Novartis'
 portfolio
 and


integrations
 frankly
 uh
 and
 then
 with


Fisers
 and
 and
 then
 you
 know
 when
 I
 was


CEO
 it
 became
 very
 very
 obvious
 that
 um


to
 me
 that
 to
 solve
 that
 that
 a
 business


that
 we
 built
 up
 from
 I
 don't know
 four


to
 10
 billion
 in
 sales
 um
 was
 never


going
 to
 be
 the
 primary
 uh
 recipient
 of


capital
 allocation
 and
 it
 was
 sort
 of


locked
 up
 division
 inside
 GSK
 that
 I


never
 got
 a
 single
 question
 on
 at


quarterly
 results
 and
 so
 it
 would
 be


much
 better
 to
 set
 that
 business
 free


and
 I'm
 delighted
 to
 see
 how
 brilliantly


they're
 doing
 with
 that
 but
 also
 use


that
 to
 reset
 the
 balance
 sheet
 and
 uh


uh
 of
 GSK
 and
 frankly
 enable
 this


fueling
 of
 growth
 and
 a
 step
 change
 in


growth.
 How
 far
 how
 far
 are
 you
 into
 the


into
 your
 change
 plan
 now?
 Well
 um
 you


know
 I
 was
 really
 pleased
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 this
 year
 to
 upgrade
 our


2031
 outlook
 for
 the
 second
 times
 and


that's
 you
 know
 we've
 added
 another


seven
 billion
 to
 the
 outlook
 just
 in


four
 years.
 That
 means
 we'll
 grow
 17


billion
 this
 decade
 in
 sales
 which
 you


know
 when
 I
 started
 we
 were
 only
 just


over
 20.
 So
 on
 the
 bioparma
 a
 bit.
 So


I'm
 really
 pleased
 with
 the
 prog


progress
 but
 the
 work
 is
 never
 ever
 done


um
 on
 this
 because
 as
 I
 said
 you
 know
 in


our
 industry
 we
 have
 to
 reinvent


ourselves
 every
 decade
 because
 of
 the


rolling
 patent.
 What's
 the
 biggest


what's
 the
 biggest
 mentality
 change
 you


have?
 Oh
 well
 this
 is
 my
 favorite


question.
 Well
 mine
 too
 you
 see.
 So,
 we


should
 we
 should
 delete
 the
 rest
 of
 this


podcast
 and
 just
 start
 here
 because
 it's


um
 I
 like
 the
 way
 you
 said
 mentality
 by


the
 way
 because
 you
 if
 you
 say
 what
 was


the
 radical
 change
 that
 I
 wanted
 to


drive
 for
 I
 think
 culture
 is
 is
 you
 know


definitely
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we've


been


uh
 working
 hard
 to
 change
 what
 was
 the


culture
 or
 what
 was
 the
 country
 in
 the


past?
 Well,
 it's
 a
 company
 that's
 been


around
 for
 over
 300
 years
 in
 a
 whole


variety
 of
 forms.
 So,
 so
 it's
 got
 a
 long


and
 proud
 history.
 Um
 but
 when
 I
 was


asked
 to
 start
 it
 was
 to
 change
 the


performance
 trajectory
 of
 the
 company


whilst
 retaining
 some
 things
 that
 have


made
 it
 very
 special
 for
 a
 long
 time


including
 a
 commitment
 to
 global
 health


including
 a
 deeply


collaborative
 culture.
 Um
 because
 this


is
 an
 industry
 where
 partnership
 and
 and


serendipity


um
 uh
 matter.
 um
 because
 it's
 hard
 and


because
 you
 know
 it's
 the
 clash
 of


brains
 and
 ideas
 um
 and
 creative


friction
 uh
 that
 can
 create
 uh
 good


things
 but
 I
 think
 we'd
 become
 for
 all


the
 pride
 in
 our
 purpose
 to
 change
 the


course
 of
 disease
 and
 to
 provide
 access


to
 medicines
 and
 we'd
 lost
 our
 way
 in


terms
 of
 performance
 edge
 in
 terms


of
 looking
 outside
 the
 company.
 This


happens
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 big
 companies
 by
 the


way
 that
 you
 get
 heavily
 matrixed,
 you


spend
 you
 think
 a
 day
 at
 work
 is
 doing


good
 meeting
 and
 you
 don't
 you're
 not


agile
 enough
 um
 and
 you
 start
 to
 think


that
 all
 good
 science
 is
 inside
 whereas


so
 how
 do
 you
 change
 this?
 It
 is
 first


of
 all
 you
 say
 it's
 really
 important
 and


you
 make
 it
 one
 of
 the
 stated
 priorities


for
 the
 company.
 So
 I
 I've
 been
 very


aggressive
 since
 I
 started
 to
 say
 look


we
 got
 three
 priorities
 which
 are


innovation,
 performance
 and
 trust.
 um


writ
 large
 obviously
 we
 take
 our


strategic
 direction
 in
 the
 therapy
 areas


we're
 going
 to
 work
 in
 and
 you
 know


specialty
 medicines
 and
 vaccines
 but
 we


underpin
 that
 and
 we
 power
 that
 by


culture
 so
 you
 say
 culture
 is
 the
 it's


not
 an
 HR
 issue
 it's
 not
 something
 we


write
 on
 the
 wall
 it
 is
 literally
 the


job
 of
 the
 leadership
 of
 the
 company
 CEO


first
 by
 the
 way
 and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 the


secret
 source
 of
 everything
 because
 when


you're
 running
 a
 company
 of
 you
 know
 in


the
 beginning
 it
 was
 100
 thousand
 people


we're
 now
 70
 or
 so


um
 you
 you
 know
 you
 can't
 you
 you
 have


to
 set
 an


environment
 that
 doesn't
 need
 constant


oversight
 or
 inspection.
 It's
 just
 the


way
 we
 work.
 So
 we
 we
 we
 spent
 a
 lot
 of


time
 defining
 what
 we
 wanted
 that


culture
 to
 be
 at
 a
 leadership
 level
 and


we
 say
 three
 simple
 things.
 Ambitious


for
 patients
 because
 that's
 the
 point
 of


everything.
 And
 there's
 a
 notion
 of


ambition
 in
 there
 which
 is
 delivering


what
 matters
 better
 and
 faster.
 uh


accountable
 for
 our
 impact
 and
 that
 is


about
 results
 not
 process
 which
 we


needed
 to
 shift
 being
 a
 bit
 government


department
 in
 the
 way
 we
 do
 things
 a
 lot


more
 individual
 accountability


um
 but
 in
 the
 spirit
 of
 uh
 um
 clear


ownership
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 what


sometimes
 goes
 wrong
 in
 collaborative


organizations
 is
 that
 there's
 a
 bit
 too


much
 by
 committee
 I'm
 a
 big
 believer
 in


single
 point
 accountable
 decision-making


so
 clear
 ownership
 and
 a
 positive


mindset
 of
 support
 to
 succeed
 and
 then


doing
 the
 right
 Absolutely.
 So
 this
 is


all
 very
 good.
 So
 this
 is
 what
 you
 say


and
 this
 is
 what
 your
 leader
 group
 say.


But
 how
 do
 you
 get
 it
 through?
 How
 do


you
 get
 it
 down
 through
 the
 perafrost


level
 in
 the
 organization?
 Really


simple.
 You
 define
 it
 and
 you
 just
 said


it.
 You
 get
 the
 message
 down
 there.
 You


never
 stop
 talking
 about
 it.
 You
 use
 a


common
 language
 worldwide.
 Worldwide.


Every
 single
 country
 when
 I
 go
 and
 and


visit,
 I
 ask
 for
 a
 session
 on
 culture


explicitly.
 Okay.
 You
 appoint
 for
 it.


I've
 been
 very
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 the
 the


the
 overhaul
 in
 talent
 in
 the
 company
 is


one
 of
 the
 most
 radical
 things
 that
 that


that
 we've
 done.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 it's


foundationally
 my
 philosophy
 of


leadership
 is
 it's
 always
 about
 people


and
 it's
 people
 that
 define
 culture.


It's
 how
 they
 show
 up
 every
 day.
 It's


the
 way
 you
 manage
 people.
 So
 you're


incredibly
 intentional
 about
 your
 talent


processes.
 I
 bet
 you
 are
 in
 order
 as


well.
 I
 mean
 there's
 no
 way.
 But
 you


don't
 you
 don't
 appoint
 people
 at
 level


six
 and
 seven.
 No,
 not
 at
 six
 at
 seven.


But
 there
 is
 a
 shadow
 of
 a
 leader


principle.
 I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 looking


at
 succession
 planning.
 Two
 weeks
 ago
 I


spent
 3
 days
 with
 the
 next
 generation


top
 30
 um
 literally
 uh
 and
 I
 am
 very


planful
 not
 on
 my
 own
 because
 it's
 a


team
 effort
 with
 the
 leadership
 team


around
 their
 career
 uh
 uh
 development.


This
 is
 purely
 three
 days
 of
 development


on
 on
 people
 and
 talking
 about
 culture


is
 at
 the
 heart
 of
 it.
 you
 incentivize


it,
 soft
 and
 hard
 incentives.
 So
 you
 I


mean
 I
 we
 changed
 the
 I
 mean
 literally


down
 to
 the
 bonuses
 system
 for
 the
 for


the


organization.
 Um
 you
 uh
 you
 promote
 for


it
 and
 you
 fire
 for
 it.
 So
 you
 know


there's
 that
 those
 famous
 matrices
 about


the
 high
 performers
 with
 the
 bad


culture.
 You
 know
 when
 I've
 made


mistakes
 on
 people
 it's
 usually
 for


cultural
 reasons.
 Um
 uh
 so
 that's
 really


important
 and
 you
 measure
 it.
 And
 how
 do


you
 screen?
 How
 do
 you
 screen
 for


attitude?
 So
 here
 I
 am,
 you're


interviewing
 me.
 I'm
 applying
 now
 level


five.
 Uh
 I
 would
 love
 to
 work
 in
 GSK.


Now
 how
 are
 you
 going
 to
 figure
 out


whether
 I
 referencing
 I'm
 a
 big
 fan
 of


referencing
 as
 a
 system
 my
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,


but
 also
 we
 do
 we
 have
 we
 do
 surveys
 and


we
 also
 do
 something
 called
 180s
 which


sounds
 a
 bit
 you
 know
 we're
 all
 familiar


with
 the
 360
 thing.
 180
 is
 purely
 your


team
 uh
 giving
 feedback
 on
 you


completely
 anonymously
 in
 this
 K
 and
 we


all
 do
 I
 have
 one
 on
 me
 as
 well
 and
 we


we
 look
 at
 the
 um
 and
 we
 spend
 time


talking
 about
 that
 in
 our
 midyear
 and


our
 year-end
 reviews.
 So,
 so
 listen,


here's
 what
 I
 would
 say.
 The
 work
 is
 not


done
 and
 I
 am
 sure,
 in
 fact,
 I
 know


there
 are
 still
 things
 that


um
 we've
 got
 room
 for
 a
 lot
 more


improvement
 on,
 but
 my
 goodness,
 the


culture
 of
 the
 organization
 has
 shifted.


You
 also
 look
 at
 where
 you
 spend
 your


time,
 Chloe.
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know
 how


how
 you
 work
 on
 this,
 but
 you
 know,
 I


spend
 I
 spend
 55%
 of
 my
 time
 internally


in
 the
 company
 because
 I
 tag
 every
 hour


of
 But
 how
 do
 you
 work
 on
 culture


specifically?
 all
 the
 time.
 I
 mean,
 I'm


every
 time
 I
 get
 the
 microphone,
 every


time
 every
 time
 I
 meet
 people,
 it's


always
 I'm
 a
 maniac
 about
 it.
 But
 and


and
 we
 need
 to
 stay
 that
 way.
 And
 by
 the


way,
 the
 other
 thing
 you
 have
 to


remember
 is
 if
 you're
 recruit
 if
 if
 you


look
 at
 your


workforce
 and
 if
 a
 third
 of
 it
 is
 new
 in


the
 last
 three
 years,
 don't
 forget
 don't


don't
 believe
 for
 a
 micro
 second
 that


what
 you
 said
 in
 a
 town
 hall
 last
 time


in
 the
 country
 has
 been
 heard.
 So,
 you


have
 to
 be
 relentless
 on
 it.
 Tell
 me


about
 uh
 Emma
 Wley
 180
 degree.
 Sorry.


Well,
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I
 want
 to
 publish


that
 completely.
 But
 listen,


um
 people


uh
 know
 that
 I
 care
 deeply
 about
 the


company


um
 and
 individuals
 development
 um
 and
 uh


I'm
 hard
 driving
 on
 clarity
 of
 strategy


and
 ownership
 uh
 of
 objectives.
 I
 could


do
 a
 better
 job
 of
 saying
 thank
 you
 and


well
 done
 because
 I
 have
 a
 habit
 which


I'm
 sure
 is
 all
 sort
 of
 deeply
 rooted
 in


my
 childhood
 of
 of
 um
 of
 looking
 up
 the


mountain
 about
 you
 know
 how
 much
 more


we've
 got
 to
 do
 rather
 than
 sometimes


occasionally
 enjoying
 the
 view.
 Um
 uh


and
 I
 think
 all
 you
 know
 we
 have
 to


remember
 work
 is
 a
 human
 endeavor
 and


everybody
 needs


um
 uh
 to
 celebrate
 the
 wins
 along
 the


way.
 So
 I
 could
 probably
 do
 a
 bit
 more


of
 that.
 Tell
 me
 how
 your
 childhood
 has


uh
 informed
 your
 leadership.
 Only
 if
 you


do
 the
 same
 for
 me.
 Come
 on,
 you.


Um
 well
 uh
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 a
 military


family.
 So
 my
 father
 was
 in
 the
 Navy
 his


whole
 career
 and
 I
 think
 that
 has


definitely
 informed
 a
 sense
 of


responsibility
 and
 a
 sense
 of
 duty
 um


and
 a
 huge
 amount
 of
 frankly
 a
 a
 pretty


strong
 work
 ethic.
 um
 and
 a
 lot
 of


curiosity
 about
 uh
 the
 world
 as
 well.
 I


mean
 I
 think
 um
 I
 wasn't
 well
 traveled


at
 all
 as
 a
 you
 know
 as
 a
 young
 person


but
 I
 had
 a
 chance
 when
 I
 was
 at


university
 to
 go
 and
 live
 and
 work


abroad
 and
 just
 before
 I
 went
 to


university
 weirdly
 in
 the
 1980s
 I


decided
 to
 take
 myself
 off
 to
 China


which
 is
 in
 the
 1980s
 which
 was
 an
 odd


thing
 to
 do.
 It
 was
 the
 first
 longhaul


flight
 I'd
 ever
 been
 on.
 But
 that
 opened


my
 mind
 to
 the
 world
 and
 and


uh
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 was
 at
 because
 I
 was
 in


in
 the
 way
 the
 system
 worked
 in
 the
 UK.


I
 was
 in
 the
 in
 a
 boarding
 school
 from
 a


very
 young
 age
 um
 because
 that
 was


funded
 by
 the
 military
 in
 in
 those
 days


and
 I
 think
 that
 gave
 me
 a
 sense
 of


independence.
 So
 I
 I
 quite
 early
 in
 my


career
 had
 an
 international
 career
 and


wanted
 to
 go
 and
 do
 that
 and
 that
 opened


up
 all
 sorts
 of
 opportunities
 I
 never


dreamt
 of
 having.
 So
 I
 had
 no
 business


background
 in
 my
 family.
 But
 um
 you
 said


um
 I
 heard
 um
 somewhere
 you
 said
 that


you
 need
 to
 have
 a
 really
 hard
 skin,
 a


tough
 skin
 to
 survive
 as
 a
 CEO.
 Well,
 I


think
 yeah,
 I
 think
 there's
 nothing
 more


obnoxious
 than
 CEOs
 saying
 they
 have
 a


hard
 life
 because
 it's
 like
 it's
 an


insane
 um
 privilege
 and
 opportunity
 and


especially
 at
 this
 time
 in
 the
 world


which
 is
 you
 know
 volatile
 and
 uncertain


as
 we
 all
 here
 and
 and
 know
 but
 it
 is


extremely
 exciting
 and
 science
 and
 tech


are
 advancing
 and
 there's
 just
 so
 much


talent
 out
 there
 with
 um
 ambition
 and


creativity.
 So
 I
 you
 know
 I
 think
 these


jobs
 are
 a
 tremendous
 privilege
 but
 with


them
 come
 the
 res
 responsibility
 to


absorb
 a
 certain
 amount
 of


public
 pressure
 and
 uh
 not
 take
 that


personally.
 Um
 but
 I
 do
 think
 part
 of


our
 job
 is
 also
 to
 protect
 the


organization
 from
 that
 kind
 of


distraction
 and
 and
 you
 know
 that
 comes


with
 the
 territory.
 So
 yeah
 you
 need


some
 resilience
 that's
 what
 kind
 of


things
 get
 under
 your
 skin.
 Look,
 I


think
 like
 all
 human
 beings,
 if
 you
 if


your
 organization
 is
 being


distracted


by
 public
 reporting
 that
 is
 factually


incorrect,
 that
 is
 annoying.
 Um
 because


it's
 hard
 to,
 you
 know,
 what
 do
 people


get
 to
 uh
 measure
 public
 commentary
 on?


So
 you
 know
 I
 think


um
 you
 know
 my
 job
 is
 to
 keep
 the


organization
 alongside
 my
 leadership


team
 because
 by
 the
 way
 I'm
 really
 don't


agree
 with
 the
 kind
 of
 CEO
 as
 superhero


notion.
 I
 think
 our
 first
 job
 is
 to
 hire


people
 that's
 part
 of
 culture
 who
 are


better
 than
 us
 and
 who
 stand
 with
 us
 in


the
 leadership
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 priorities


and
 uh
 an
 agenda.
 But
 our
 job
 is
 to
 keep


the
 organization
 focused
 on
 what
 it
 can


control.
 and
 what
 it
 is
 there
 to
 do.
 And


our
 people
 are
 so
 inspired
 by
 the


purpose
 of
 GSK.
 I
 mean,
 they
 literally,


you
 know,
 blows
 my
 mind
 when
 you
 see
 the


energy
 with
 which
 15,000
 scientists
 get


up
 to
 do
 the
 near
 impossible
 and
 to
 try


and,
 you
 know,
 explore
 new
 frontiers
 of


neurodeeneration
 or
 literally
 cure


cancer
 or
 help
 people
 breathe
 easier


every
 day.
 And
 where
 do
 you
 where
 do
 you


seek
 seek
 advice?
 Presently
 I
 have
 a


very
 good
 board
 and
 a
 brilliant


chairman.
 Um
 uh
 I
 quite
 like
 the


European
 way
 of
 the
 separation
 of
 these


jobs.
 Everyone
 will
 have
 their
 different


views
 on
 that.
 Yeah,
 we
 we
 fully
 support


that
 too.
 Uh
 uh
 and
 and
 you
 know
 a
 good


board
 and
 a
 and
 a
 brilliant
 chairman


means
 people
 who
 challenge
 you
 to
 be


better
 at
 the
 job
 and
 are
 at
 stake
 for


the
 company
 and
 its
 stakeholders
 be
 they


patients,
 shareholders
 or
 our
 people.
 Um


I
 have
 technical
 advisers
 who
 are


externals
 who
 are
 experts
 in
 their


fields
 and
 then
 I
 have
 I
 suppose
 maybe


they're
 not
 advisers
 as
 much
 as
 the
 sort


of
 support
 system
 of
 your
 family.
 I
 my


children
 are
 adult
 now
 so
 they're
 they


uh
 it's
 not
 they
 advise
 me
 on
 the


strategy
 of
 GSK
 but
 they
 sometimes
 they


remind
 me
 to
 keep
 my
 feet
 very
 firmly
 on


the
 ground
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 matters
 in


in
 life
 and
 the
 point
 of
 it
 all.
 You


have
 um
 an
 honors
 system
 in
 the
 UK
 and


you
 were
 uh
 you
 were
 named
 a
 Dame.
 Yes.


Right.
 You
 are
 Dame
 Emma,
 right?
 Yeah.


Um
 what
 did
 what
 did
 that
 do
 to
 you?
 You


think?
 Well,
 it
 was
 a
 surprise.
 That
 was


certainly
 true.
 Um
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a
 very


important
 moment
 for
 my
 parents
 actually


um
 and
 my
 family.
 And
 then
 sometimes,
 I


mean,
 it's
 an
 incredible
 honor
 and
 I
 uh


I
 never
 dreamt
 that
 my
 life
 would
 um


take
 the
 paths
 it
 has.
 And
 that's,
 you


know,
 I'm
 a
 I'm
 a
 great
 patriot.
 I'm
 a


I'm
 a
 globalist.
 I've
 lived
 in
 mainland


Europe,
 in
 the
 US,
 in
 China.
 Uh
 I
 travel


all
 the
 time.
 I
 think
 next
 week
 I'm
 in


three
 continents,
 so
 that'll
 be
 um


reasonably
 physically
 uh
 entertaining.


Um
 but
 I
 I
 am
 very
 proud
 of
 this


country.
 So,
 it
 meant
 something,
 but


honestly,
 it's
 not
 something
 I
 think


about
 very
 much.
 I
 I'm
 um
 and
 I
 usually


forget.
 Um
 I
 saw
 some
 research
 once
 that


when
 you
 get
 an
 honor
 like
 that,
 you


tend
 to


um
 think
 more
 about
 all
 the
 stakeholders


in
 society
 and
 actually
 um
 you
 people


tend
 to
 lay
 off
 less
 people.
 uh
 they


tend
 uh
 sometimes
 economic
 results
 of


the
 company
 you
 run
 uh
 actually


deteriorates
 and
 takes
 a
 hit
 from
 this


because
 suddenly
 because
 you
 you
 just


become
 I
 don't
 know
 less
 uh
 you
 become


perhaps
 less
 cynical
 more
 thinking
 about


society
 overall.
 Do
 you
 think
 there
 is


something
 in
 that?
 Well,
 the
 thing
 I


would
 absolutely
 uh
 argue
 against
 is
 the


notion
 that


uh
 there
 is
 a


contradiction
 between
 the
 delivery
 of


performance
 and
 strong
 financial
 results


and
 being
 social
 responsible.
 I
 mean
 in


my
 industry
 and
 in
 my
 company
 they
 are


literally
 completely
 aligned
 because
 if


we
 grow
 we
 are
 changing
 the
 lives
 of


more
 patients.
 If
 we
 innovate
 that's


recognized
 by
 the
 market
 in
 terms
 of
 you


know
 the
 value
 of
 our
 pipeline.
 So
 I
 and


by
 the
 way
 if
 you
 actually
 look
 uh
 not


to
 sound
 offensive
 but
 at
 our
 track


record
 of
 performance
 since
 that


happened
 it
 has
 been
 completely


transformed.
 That
 is
 literally
 probably


the
 pivot
 point.
 But
 I'm
 afraid
 that
 it


would
 be
 again
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 I
 would


express
 my
 gratitude
 but
 it
 is
 it's
 not


something
 I
 think
 about
 and
 I
 honestly
 I


have
 never


felt
 more
 full
 of
 energy
 and
 appetite


for
 impact.
 Um
 uh
 but
 I
 do
 think
 it's


important
 to
 remember
 it's
 not
 only


about
 you
 know
 pounds
 and
 and
 and


dollars.
 It's
 about
 the
 lives
 that
 you


change,
 which
 is
 why
 you
 asked
 me


earlier,
 what
 are
 the
 biggest
 medicines?


And
 I
 answered
 in
 terms
 of
 revenue.


Actually,
 uh
 I
 think
 it
 would
 be
 fair
 to


say
 that
 last
 year
 we
 the
 biggest


medicine
 or
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 medicines


that
 we
 gave
 were
 donations.


I
 think
 440
 million
 donations
 of
 doses


um
 of
 a
 drug
 that's
 for
 a
 neglected


tropical
 disease
 in
 in
 Africa
 which


we've
 called
 lymphatic
 fyeris
 um
 a


horrible
 disease
 um
 uh
 and
 the
 scale
 of


lives
 you
 know
 protected
 uh
 from
 that
 is


is
 really
 meaningful
 so
 I
 think
 we
 do


have
 to
 think
 in
 a
 multistakeholder


world
 but
 nothing
 will
 happen
 unless
 we


are
 financially
 successful
 because
 we


need
 to
 fund
 the
 next
 wave
 of
 innovation


a
 bit
 more
 um
 on
 the
 personal
 frontier


at
 the
 end.
 Um
 sure.
 What
 is
 energy?


Well,
 for
 me
 it's
 something
 uh
 that
 is


fueled


um
 and
 allows
 you
 to


uh
 keep
 getting
 back
 up
 whatever
 the


challenges
 are,
 but
 also
 inspire
 others


as
 a
 leader
 to
 do
 more
 than
 they
 ever


dreamt
 possible
 both
 individually
 but


also
 as
 scale.
 Uh
 and
 and
 where
 do
 you


get
 your
 energy
 from?
 purpose,


um,


opportunity,
 curiosity,
 other
 human


beings,


um,


uh,
 the
 love
 of
 my


family,
 and
 the
 deep
 belief
 that
 you
 get


one
 life
 and
 you
 shouldn't
 waste
 a


single
 second
 of
 it.


What
 are
 you
 trying
 to
 learn
 these
 days?


Oh,
 everything
 about
 what's
 possible.
 I


mean,
 I'm
 just
 I
 am
 so


uh
 fascinated
 by
 how
 technology
 is
 going


to
 change
 society
 again.
 I
 mean,
 as
 it


always
 has
 done,
 by
 the
 way.
 I
 think
 we


think
 we're
 in
 a
 uniquely
 privileged


moment,
 but
 probably
 people
 have
 done


throughout
 throughout
 history.


Um,
 I've
 been
 lucky
 enough
 to


have,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 exposure
 to
 um


to
 the
 world
 and
 and
 uh
 issues
 that


matter
 to
 society
 more
 broadly
 and
 the


role
 of
 business
 in
 society
 and
 all
 of


those
 things
 I'm
 extremely
 curious


about.
 But
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 get
 annoyed


when
 I
 walk
 into
 libraries
 about
 all
 the


books
 I
 haven't
 read.
 So,
 what
 about


you?
 What
 do
 you
 read
 now?
 Well,
 I've


got
 about
 I've
 got
 far
 too
 many
 books


going
 on.
 I've
 just
 finished
 a
 novel


called
 Demon
 Copperhead.
 I
 don't know
 if


you've
 read
 it,
 but
 it's
 brilliant.


Absolutely
 extraordinary
 and
 so
 clever


in
 terms
 of
 um
 the
 David
 Copperfield
 uh


alignment.
 I
 listen
 to
 things
 when
 I'm


exercising
 badly
 in
 the
 gym


occasionally.
 I
 I'm
 I
 love
 I
 mean
 I
 mean


I'm
 originally
 a
 literature
 student,
 so


I
 like
 I
 like
 poetry.
 I
 don't
 get
 enough


time
 to
 read
 to
 be honest.
 It's
 one
 of


the
 things
 if
 I
 if
 I
 could
 have
 a
 I
 was


going
 to
 say
 a
 bad
 habit,
 but
 it's
 not
 a


bad
 habit.
 Be
 very
 poetry
 you
 have
 in


common
 with
 Saja
 Nadella.
 He's
 actually


the
 only
 one
 we've
 had
 on
 the
 podcast


series
 who
 reads
 poetry
 or
 who
 talks


about
 reading
 poetry.
 Well,
 you
 know,
 so


it's
 the
 two
 of
 you.
 So,
 I
 know
 that


I'll
 have
 to
 ask
 her
 about
 it.
 I


definitely
 can't
 talk
 to
 him
 about


cricket.
 So,
 I
 should
 ask
 him
 about


that.
 When
 do
 you
 wake
 up
 in
 the


morning?
 Early.
 I'm
 an
 early
 morning


person.
 I
 mean,
 by
 the
 way,
 because
 I


travel
 so
 much,
 I
 don't
 know
 whether


it's
 morning
 or
 night.
 I'm
 I'm
 and
 I'm


I'm
 good
 at
 sleeping,
 but
 normally
 my


alarm
 is
 set
 for
 five.
 What
 is
 your


advice
 to
 young
 people?
 Last
 question.


Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 will
 answer
 that


question
 if
 you
 answer
 it.
 And
 I
 would


say


uh
 three
 things.
 First
 of
 all,
 don't


listen
 to
 the
 advice
 of
 old
 people
 too


much.
 Totally.


Um
 second
 of
 all,
 um
 you
 know,
 we
 we


invented
 a
 sort
 of
 family
 motto
 when
 the


kids
 were
 little,
 which
 for
 us
 was
 be


was
 and
 this
 is
 probably
 us
 just
 trying


to
 shorthand
 what
 parents
 thought
 we


should
 do,
 which
 would
 was
 which
 which


was
 be
 kind,
 be
 brave,
 and
 be


truthful.
 And
 I
 still
 stand
 by
 that.


probably
 add
 um
 be
 curious
 because
 I


think
 I
 think
 to
 I
 worry
 about
 the


pressure
 that's
 on
 young
 people
 today


who
 all
 seem
 to
 be
 worrying
 about


strategizing
 their
 careers.
 I
 don't
 know


how
 much
 strategizing
 your
 career
 did.
 I


said
 none
 like
 literally
 none.
 I
 think


my
 entire
 work
 experience
 was


waitressing
 when
 I
 left
 university
 and


then
 I
 just
 worked
 really
 hard
 at
 things


I
 thought
 were
 really
 interesting
 and


opportunities
 arose.
 I
 mean
 like
 luck


was
 a
 huge
 part
 of
 it,
 but
 I
 think
 they


put
 too
 much
 pressure
 on
 themselves
 and


and
 and
 should
 genuinely
 be
 just
 crazy


curious
 to
 learn
 as
 much
 as
 they
 can
 in


this
 exciting
 world
 at
 the
 moment.
 And


then
 the
 last
 thing
 I
 would
 say
 is
 I


think
 the
 title
 of
 your
 podcast,
 which


I'm
 now
 going
 to
 be
 very
 enthusiastic


about
 listening
 to
 all
 the
 past
 episodes


of,
 is
 brilliant.
 Um
 because
 what


matters
 in
 life
 is
 the
 company
 you
 keep.


So
 whether
 it's
 personally
 or


professionally,
 hang
 out
 with


extraordinary
 people
 who
 teach
 you
 a
 lot


and
 make
 you
 laugh,
 uh,
 help
 you
 get
 up


again
 when
 you
 fall
 over,
 um,
 and


stretch
 you
 to
 do
 more
 than
 you
 ever


thought
 you
 could
 do.
 Well,
 Dame,
 Emma,


Wly,
 you
 are
 for
 sure
 an
 amazing
 person


and
 a
 big
 thanks
 for
 coming
 here.
 Well,


thank
 you.
 That's
 been
 such
 a
 pleasure.


But
 what
 about
 you?
 You
 got
 to
 tell
 me


the
 last
 answer
 yourself.
 What
 do
 you


say
 to
 young
 people?
 A
 separate
 podcast.
