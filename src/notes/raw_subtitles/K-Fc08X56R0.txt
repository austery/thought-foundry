everyone
 knows
 if
 you
 shake
 up
 a


carbonated
 drink
 it
 explodes
 but
 why
 is


this
 well
 here
 I
 have
 an
 identical


bottle
 with
 a
 pressure
 gauge
 fitted
 to


it
 and
 I
 want
 you
 to
 make
 a
 prediction


right
 here
 if
 I
 shake
 up
 this
 bottle


will
 the
 pressure
 increase
 decrease
 or


remain
 the
 same
 and
 while
 you're


thinking
 about
 that
 let
 me
 tell
 you
 this


video

 by
 Squarespace

all-in-one
 platform
 for

online
 presence
 more
 about
 Squarespace


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 show
 okay


I
 hope
 you've
 made
 your
 prediction
 and


registered
 it
 in
 the
 poll
 up
 here
 this


bottle
 has
 been
 sitting
 stationary
 for
 a


few
 days
 at
 room
 temperature
 you
 can
 see


the
 pressure
 reading
 is
 about
 three


atmospheres
 330
 kiloPascals
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 shake
 it
 up
 and
 see
 what


happens
 ready
 in
 three
 two
 one
 and
 the


pressure
 is
 still
 the
 same
 you
 might


suspect
 that
 well
 maybe
 this
 bottle
 is


all
 out
 of
 gas
 maybe
 it
 wouldn't
 explode


on
 me
 so
 just
 to
 make
 sure
 yep
 it
 would


go
 so
 it's
 not
 an
 increase
 in
 pressure


that
 causes
 a
 bottle
 to
 explode
 like


that


so
 why
 is
 it
 we
 shouldn't
 feel
 bad
 if


you
 predicted
 that
 the
 pressure
 would


increase
 because
 in
 fact
 that


explanation
 was
 published
 in
 New


Scientist
 in
 1986
 leaving
 many
 other


scientists
 to
 come
 forward
 saying
 that


is
 not
 the
 real
 explanation
 so
 we
 will


find
 out
 what
 it
 is


after
 we
 explore
 the
 second
 perplexing


physics
 problem
 consider
 this
 if
 you
 put


identical
 ice
 cubes
 in
 a
 cup
 of
 fresh


water
 and
 a
 cup
 of
 saltwater
 which
 ice


cube
 will
 melt
 first
 again
 you
 can


register
 your
 prediction
 by
 answering


the
 poll
 here
 now
 as
 you're
 thinking


about
 that
 I
 want
 to
 show
 you
 the
 setup


okay
 so
 here
 I
 have
 regular
 fresh
 water


I'm
 just
 gonna
 fill
 up
 each
 cup
 then
 I'm


gonna
 add
 about
 a
 tablespoon
 of
 salt


into
 this
 cup
 on
 the
 right
 if
 you
 know
 a


bit
 about
 chemistry


you
 may
 recognize
 that
 adding
 sodium


chloride


water
 actually
 takes
 energy
 and
 so
 it


lowers
 the
 temperature
 of
 this
 solution


by
 a
 little
 bit
 so
 I've
 got
 a


thermometer
 just
 to
 check
 and
 I'm
 gonna


let
 this
 solution
 sit
 here
 for
 a
 while


so
 that
 it
 comes
 back
 up
 to
 room


temperature
 okay
 have
 you
 made
 your


prediction
 let's
 put
 these
 ice
 cubes
 in


in
 three
 two
 one


and
 they're
 off
 watching
 Ice
 Cube's
 melt


isn't
 this
 entertaining
 YouTube
 it
 has


only
 been
 about
 a
 minute
 but
 already
 I


can
 tell
 that
 the
 ice
 cube
 in
 the
 fresh


water
 is
 melting
 faster
 than
 the
 ice


cube
 in
 the
 salt
 water
 how
 does
 that


make
 any
 sense


and
 we
 put
 salt
 on
 the
 roads
 to
 melt
 ice


faster
 so
 why
 isn't
 this
 ice
 cube


melting
 as
 fast
 as
 the
 one
 in
 fresh


water
 well
 that
 is
 what
 I'm
 gonna


explain
 but
 first
 let's
 go
 to
 the
 third


perplexing
 physics
 problem
 okay
 here
 I


have
 a
 metal
 ring
 and
 a
 closed
 loop
 of


chain
 and
 I'm
 gonna
 do
 this
 all
 in
 one


take
 so
 you
 know
 that
 I'm
 not
 playing


any
 tricks
 so
 what
 I'm
 gonna
 do
 is


dangle
 the
 chain
 and
 then
 hold
 the
 ring


over
 it
 like
 so
 and
 then
 I'm
 gonna
 drop


the
 ring
 and
 exactly
 what
 you
 expect


happens
 the
 ring
 just
 falls
 off
 this


chain
 and
 of
 course
 how
 could
 anything


else
 possibly
 happen
 because
 well
 it's
 a


closed
 loop
 of
 chain
 and
 a
 closed
 ring


but
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it
 really
 hard


you
 can
 get
 the
 ring
 to
 stick
 on
 the


chain


have
 a
 look
 at
 that
 so
 how
 does
 this


work
 well
 I
 think
 we're
 gonna
 have
 to
 go


to
 some
 slow-mo
 footage
 to
 really
 see


what's
 going
 on


now
 I'll
 let
 you
 in
 on
 the
 secret
 when


you
 want
 the
 ring
 to
 stick
 on
 the
 chain


the
 key
 is
 to
 let
 it
 go
 on
 one
 side


before
 the
 other
 side
 so
 I'm
 going
 to


let
 let
 it
 go
 with
 my
 thumb
 first
 and


it'll
 just
 sort
 of
 slide
 off
 my
 finger


and
 by
 doing
 that
 the
 ring
 will
 stick
 on


the
 chain
 it
 introduces
 just
 a
 little


bit
 of
 rotation
 so
 that
 the
 ring
 rotates


about
 90
 degrees
 and
 slides
 down
 the


chain
 like
 this
 as
 it
 does
 these
 pieces


slide
 up
 the
 sides
 and
 when
 you
 get
 to


the
 bottom
 it's
 almost
 like
 this
 piece


at
 the
 bottom
 gets
 sucked
 into
 the


middle
 of
 the
 ring
 and
 then
 at
 the
 last


minute
 gets
 pulled
 around
 and
 it
 snaps


on
 and
 it's
 locked
 on
 like
 that


[Music]


so
 that's
 how
 you
 can
 get
 a
 ring
 locked


on
 to
 a
 closed
 loop
 of
 chain
 so
 back
 to


problem
 number
 two
 why
 is
 the
 ice
 cube


in
 fresh
 water
 melting
 faster
 than
 the


one
 in
 salt
 water
 well
 I
 think
 we
 can


get
 a
 better
 view
 of
 this
 if
 I
 add
 a


little
 bit
 of
 food
 coloring
 right
 on
 top


of
 the
 ice
 cube
 because
 the
 water
 coming


off
 that
 ice
 cube
 is
 cold
 it's
 more


dense
 than
 the
 surrounding
 fresh
 water


and
 so
 it
 descends
 in
 the
 glass
 and
 that


brings
 more
 warm
 fresh
 water
 up
 to
 meet


the
 ice
 cube
 melting
 it
 faster
 whereas


on
 the
 other
 hand
 in
 the
 salt
 water
 as


the
 ice
 cube
 melts
 that
 fresh
 water
 is


actually
 less
 dense
 than
 the
 salt
 water


around
 it
 and
 so
 it
 stays
 that
 cold


water
 that
 just
 melted
 off
 the
 ice
 cube


stays
 around
 the
 ice
 cube
 in
 effect


insulating
 it
 from
 the
 warmer
 salt
 water


around
 it
 okay
 that
 seems
 like
 a
 very


plausible
 explanation
 and
 maybe
 a


convincing
 demonstration
 but
 in
 the
 Edit


me
 from
 the
 future
 I
 decided
 that
 you


know
 maybe
 this
 wasn't
 the
 best
 way
 to


explain
 this
 because
 well
 you're
 just


dropping
 food
 coloring
 in
 there
 and


maybe
 food
 coloring
 would
 just
 float
 on


the
 surface
 of
 salt
 water
 anyway
 and


sink
 in
 fresh
 water
 so
 not
 a
 good


demonstration
 so
 a
 better
 demonstration


I
 thought
 might
 be
 if
 we
 use
 colored
 ice


cubes
 to
 begin
 with
 okay
 I
 know
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 food
 coloring
 in
 there
 and
 that


makes
 things
 kind
 of
 hard
 to
 see
 but
 I


think
 you
 can
 clearly
 see
 the
 currents


of
 cold
 water
 streaming
 down
 at
 the


bottom
 of
 the
 cup
 in
 the
 fresh
 water


side
 and
 not
 in
 the
 salt
 water
 side
 so
 I


think
 this
 does
 clearly
 show
 what
 I
 was


saying
 that
 cool
 water
 that
 comes
 off


the
 ice
 cube
 doesn't
 go
 down


deep
 into
 the
 cup
 over
 here
 you
 can
 see


that's
 what's
 happened
 so
 why
 do
 shaken


carbonated
 drinks
 explode
 well
 first


let's
 explain
 why
 the
 pressure
 doesn't


increase
 in
 the
 headspace
 when
 you
 shake


it
 up
 this
 is
 because
 of
 equilibrium
 you


know
 when
 you
 pick
 up
 a
 bottle
 of
 soda


in
 the
 grocery
 store
 it's
 been
 sitting


there
 for
 a
 few
 days
 so
 the
 dissolved


gas
 the
 dissolved
 co2
 in
 the
 liquid
 is


at
 equilibrium
 with
 the
 gas
 up
 here
 in


the
 head
 space
 and
 that
 equilibrium
 only


depends
 on
 the
 temperature
 and
 the


pressure
 of
 gas
 in
 the
 headspace
 so
 no


amount
 of
 shaking
 is
 going
 to
 change
 the


pressure
 up
 here
 for
 most
 soda
 bottles


these
 days
 that
 pressure
 is
 about
 3


atmospheres
 now
 you
 can
 actually
 hear


those
 3
 atmospheres
 of
 pressure
 get


released
 when
 I
 open
 the
 bottle
 but
 of


course
 that's
 not
 messy
 because
 it's


just
 gas
 coming
 at
 the
 top
 there's
 no


liquid
 but
 now
 the
 liquid
 is
 no
 longer


in
 equilibrium
 I
 mean
 it
 used
 to
 be


under
 3
 atmospheres
 of
 pressure
 and
 now


it's
 just
 under
 1
 atmosphere
 ambient


pressure
 and
 so
 because
 of
 that
 there
 is


more
 dissolved
 co2
 in
 this
 liquid
 then


would
 be
 at
 equilibrium
 at
 this
 pressure


and
 so
 the
 co2
 starts
 to
 come
 out
 of


solution
 and
 well
 those
 are
 the
 bubbles


that
 you
 taste
 that's
 why
 this
 drink
 is


fizzy
 non-equilibrium
 beverage
 and
 if


you
 leave
 it
 open
 those
 bubbles
 will


keep
 coming
 out
 until
 the
 whole
 drink


goes
 flat
 now
 I'm
 gonna
 put
 the
 pressure


gauge
 on
 top
 of
 this
 bottle
 so
 we
 can


actually
 see
 the
 co2
 coming
 out
 of


solution
 and
 increasing
 the
 pressure


right
 here
 and
 if
 I
 left
 this
 bottle


alone
 for
 long
 enough
 the
 pressure
 would


eventually
 come
 back
 to
 equilibrium
 3


atmospheres
 but
 as
 you
 can
 see
 it
 is
 a


very
 slow
 process
 and
 that's
 because


it's
 actually
 quite
 hard
 for
 dissolved


gas
 like
 co2
 to
 spontaneously
 come
 out


of
 solution
 one
 way
 that
 I
 can


accelerate
 this
 process
 is
 by


introducing
 nucleation
 sites
 into
 the


liquid
 and
 one
 example
 of
 a
 nucleation


site
 is
 a
 tiny
 gas
 bubble
 so
 if
 I
 shake


up
 the
 bottle


what
 am


actually
 doing
 is
 introducing
 little


nucleation
 sites
 tiny
 air
 bubbles
 into


the
 liquid
 and
 that
 makes
 it
 easier
 for


the
 co2
 to
 come
 out
 of
 solution
 and
 so


we'll
 see
 this
 pressure
 increase
 much


more
 rapidly
 you
 ready
 I'm
 going
 to


shake
 it
 up
 in
 three
 two
 one
 and
 there


you
 see
 the
 pressure
 has
 quite
 quickly


come
 back
 to
 about
 three
 atmospheres
 320


kiloPascals


so
 if
 you
 shake
 up
 a
 closed
 carbonated


drink
 that's
 been
 at
 equilibrium
 well


you
 are
 not
 increasing
 the
 pressure
 in


the
 bottle
 but
 you
 are
 introducing
 tiny


air
 bubbles
 into
 the
 liquid
 which
 act
 as


nucleation
 sites
 some
 of
 them
 clinging


to
 the
 walls
 of
 the
 bottle
 so
 when
 you


go
 to
 open
 it
 those
 bubbles
 do
 two


things
 first
 they
 expand
 due
 to
 the


decrease
 in
 pressure
 and
 that
 pushes
 up


the
 liquid
 above
 them
 and
 second
 they


act
 as
 nucleation
 sites
 allowing
 the


dissolved
 co2
 to
 come
 out
 of
 solution


much
 more
 rapidly
 and
 so
 that's
 what


leads
 to
 the
 carbonated
 drink
 explosion


but
 this
 is
 just
 a
 way
 to
 disarm
 a


shaken
 carbonated
 beverage
 and
 that
 is


by
 flicking
 the
 walls
 of
 the
 bottle
 that


gets
 rid
 of
 those
 bubbles
 that
 are


clinging
 to
 the
 sides
 and
 allows
 you
 to


open
 the
 bottle
 without
 incident
 ah
 it


worked
 now
 is
 there
 a
 way
 to
 introduce


nucleation
 sites
 into
 of
 carbonated


drink
 without
 shaking
 it
 yes
 that's


exactly
 what
 you're
 doing
 when
 you
 put
 a


Mentos
 in
 a
 carbonated
 drink
 the
 rough


surface
 of
 the
 Mentos
 acts
 as
 a


nucleation
 site
 which
 allows
 the
 co2
 to


come
 out
 of
 solution
 much
 faster


creating
 the
 soda
 fountain
 me
 again
 so


when
 I
 showed
 this
 video
 to
 Diana
 the


physics
 girl
 she
 asked
 whether
 paper


straws
 have
 more
 nucleation
 sites
 than


plastic
 ones
 and
 to
 be
 honest
 I'm
 not


sure
 about
 the
 research
 around
 this
 but


there
 are
 some
 other
 YouTube
 videos
 as


showing
 how
 drinks
 overflow
 when
 you
 put


a
 paper
 straw
 in
 and
 also
 my


preliminary
 analysis
 with
 this
 paper


straw
 show
 that
 it
 does
 indeed
 create


more
 bubbles
 than
 a
 plastic
 straw
 so
 if


you
 needed
 another
 reason
 to
 hate
 paper


straws
 well
 there
 you
 go
 they
 make
 your


carbonated
 drink
 more
 fizzy
 as
 it
 comes


up
 the
 straw
 this
 has
 been
 three


perplexing
 physics
 problems
 if
 you
 have


any
 other
 perplexing
 science
 problems


put
 them
 in
