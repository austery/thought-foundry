[Music]


hi
 everyone
 today
 I'm
 in
 this
 seriously


good
 company
 with
 Marcus
 wenberg
 who
 is


the
 chair
 of
 SCB
 Banking
 and
 vice
 chair


of
 investor
 AB
 both
 really
 important


companies
 in
 the
 wenberg
 family
 now
 for


those
 of
 you
 are
 not
 familiar
 with
 the


wenberg
 they
 control
 and
 have
 influence


over
 companies
 such
 as
 Erikson
 Atlas


Copco
 electrox
 asra
 ABB
 SC
 bankin
 and


this
 journey
 started
 back
 in
 1850


incredible
 so
 Marcus
 what
 a
 pleasure
 to


have
 you
 here
 thank
 you
 it's
 great
 to
 be


here
 with
 you
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 survive


for
 have
 175
 years
 uh
 I'm
 well
 there
 are


many
 aspects
 of
 course
 uh
 with
 that
 but


uh
 perhaps
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 or


one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 things
 would


be
 that
 you
 are
 ready
 to
 adapt
 with
 the


times
 I
 think
 that
 is
 a
 very
 important


part
 of
 it
 and
 what's
 been
 the
 most


important
 adaptions
 you've
 done
 you


think
 well
 you
 know
 I
 I
 think
 that
 if


you
 think
 about


175
 years
 back
 uh
 you
 will
 of
 course


Very
 quickly
 come
 to
 such
 things
 as


dramatic
 technological
 change
 uh
 gone


through
 the
 times
 of
 the
 steam
 engine


the
 electrification
 now
 we
 have
 the


internet
 that
 we
 just
 passed
 now
 we're


in
 the
 age
 of
 AI
 so
 the
 wish
 and
 the


drive
 to
 change
 with
 the
 times
 is
 in


very
 very
 important
 aspect
 what
 part
 of


the
 wenberg
 Legacy
 are
 you
 the
 most


proud
 of
 the
 fact
 uh
 that
 we
 are
 able
 to


um
 be
 here
 as
 a
 family
 uh
 to
 work


together
 in
 our
 family
 is
 very
 important


um
 I
 think
 that
 is
 uh
 perhaps
 one
 of
 the


uh
 things
 that
 we
 can
 be
 proud
 of
 that


we've
 been
 able
 uh
 throughout
 the


generations
 to
 do
 that
 uh
 I
 think
 also


that
 we
 have
 the
 possibility


uh
 to
 not
 only
 work
 with
 companies
 but


also
 to
 support
 uh
 research
 and


education
 uh
 is
 an
 important
 aspect
 of


what
 has
 been
 done
 capitalism
 looks
 very


different
 in
 the
 Nordic
 countries
 so
 in


Denmark
 you
 have
 foundations
 in
 Norway


the
 state
 is
 very
 important
 uh
 with
 part


ownerships
 and
 in
 Sweden
 of
 course
 you


and
 a
 couple
 of
 other
 families
 are
 very


important
 for
 long-term
 ownership
 so
 how


do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 look
 at
 yourself
 are


you
 uh
 you
 know
 are
 you
 an
 owner
 or
 do


you
 feel
 like
 more
 like
 a
 prime
 minister


uh
 just
 how
 do


you
 how
 do
 you
 look
 at
 yourself
 uh
 I


mean
 you're
 much
 more
 important
 than
 the


prime
 minister
 no
 I
 would
 not
 say
 so
 in


these
 times
 I
 would
 tell
 you
 that


democracy
 is
 an
 extremely
 important


thing
 that
 we
 should
 be
 uh
 guarding


carefully
 I
 think
 about
 it
 as
 two
 dual


tracks
 from
 an
 ownership
 side
 uh
 being
 a


steward
 of
 of
 corporations
 that
 we
 try


to
 work
 very
 closely
 with
 uh
 where
 we


have
 a
 financial
 interest
 uh
 in
 order
 to


create
 value
 over
 time
 and
 develop
 them


uh
 be
 close
 to
 them
 so
 we
 can
 see
 that


they
 they
 stay
 competitive
 in
 a
 very
 in


a
 dramatically
 changing
 world
 uh
 on
 the


second
 track
 uh
 doing
 what
 you're
 saying


about
 the
 foundations
 U
 supporting


um
 these
 foundations
 who
 are
 giving
 uh
 a


substantial
 amount
 of
 money


to
 Swedish
 universities
 primarily
 uh
 for


the
 betterment
 of
 Sweden
 which
 is
 in


turn
 I
 think
 helps
 uh
 Sweden
 as
 a
 very


small
 country
 in
 in
 in
 the
 view
 of
 this


large
 world
 uh
 to
 try
 to
 stay


competitive
 in
 certain
 Fields
 how


important
 are
 these
 foundations
 for
 you


personally
 and
 for
 and
 for
 the
 people


who
 work
 in
 all
 these
 companies
 I
 think


there
 are
 many
 many
 uh
 of
 the
 um


colleagues
 who
 actually
 are
 quite
 happy


with
 that
 uh
 the
 dividends
 that
 come
 out


of
 these
 companies
 actually
 go
 back
 uh


for
 a
 good


cause
 uh
 and
 uh
 for
 us
 and
 the
 family


it's
 very
 important
 it
 helps
 us
 to
 stay


uh
 a
 bit
 closer
 to
 what
 goes
 on
 in


science
 and
 technology
 to
 see
 what
 is


about
 to
 come
 uh
 which
 I
 think


is
 in
 in
 when
 you
 think
 about
 it
 in
 that


you're
 adapting
 with
 the
 world
 that
 is


an
 important
 input
 to
 that
 equation
 you


have
 saying
 that
 you
 want
 to
 do
 things


without
 being
 seen
 publicly
 too
 much
 to


be
 not
 seem
 to
 be
 yeah
 what's
 the


thinking
 behind
 this
 it
 was
 my


great-grandfather
 who
 who
 uh
 adopted


that
 saying
 uh
 I
 think
 he
 pointed
 to


what
 is
 something
 we
 think
 is
 very


important
 namely
 um
 we


should
 uh
 really
 work
 as
 a
 family
 to
 do


things
 that
 will
 have
 a
 good
 impact
 but


the
 most
 important
 is
 perhaps
 not
 that


you're
 standing
 in
 the
 front
 line
 but


that
 you


actually
 uh
 support
 that
 these
 things


are
 happening
 well
 you
 on
 the
 front
 line


now
 in
 this
 podcast
 yes
 uh
 I
 am
 and
 uh
 I


think
 you
 are
 uh
 doing
 something
 quite


interesting
 uh
 since
 you're
 using
 your


time
 to
 spread
 the
 word
 about
 different


companies
 and
 individuals
 that's
 an


interesting
 aspect
 of
 your
 job
 yeah
 and


we
 are
 very
 keen
 to
 learn
 from
 how


you're
 doing
 things
 because
 I
 do
 think


we
 need
 to
 extend
 the
 time
 Horizon
 for


planning
 we
 need
 to
 be
 more
 long-term


and
 act
 more
 like
 owners
 rather
 than


than
 investors
 which
 is
 why
 we
 are
 here


how
 would
 you
 uh
 characterize
 the


wenberg
 culture
 or
 is
 there
 such
 a
 thing


as
 a
 Wallenberg
 culture
 we
 hope
 hope


there
 is
 uh
 a
 set
 of
 values
 that
 is
 very


important
 to
 us
 as
 a
 family
 you
 just


mentioned
 the
 long-term
 aspect
 uh
 to


stay
 with
 the
 companies
 try
 to
 be


supportive
 uh
 of
 them
 for
 a
 long
 time


see
 a
 change
 in
 these
 companies
 to
 be


really
 competitive
 uh
 we
 talk
 a
 lot


about
 the
 uh
 future
 proofing
 of


companies
 which
 basically
 means
 uh
 today


we're
 we're
 looking
 very
 much
 at
 the


people
 question
 we
 think
 that
 is


extremely
 important
 we
 look
 at
 uh


companies
 and
 their
 ability
 to
 innovate


and
 not
 the
 least
 also
 with


sustainability
 and
 uh
 last
 but
 not
 least


I
 would
 say
 the
 demands
 on
 all
 companies


to
 understand
 their
 data
 and
 Ai
 and


cyber
 strategies
 now
 you
 run
 um
 this
 uh


in
 a
 way
 together
 with
 your
 cousin
 um


how
 were
 you
 groomed
 to
 take
 over
 this


for
 instance
 we
 had
 John
 alen
 on
 uh


while
 back
 he
 was
 told
 that
 he
 should


take
 it
 over
 when
 he
 was
 like
 22
 or


something
 right
 yeah
 now
 how
 old
 were


you
 when
 you
 knew
 that
 you
 would
 have


this
 incredible
 responsibility
 well
 I
 I


think
 that
 uh
 we


U
 uh
 in
 our
 generation
 we
 were
 always


told
 by
 the
 older
 generation
 that
 just


because
 your
 name
 is
 wenberg
 you
 don't


get
 a
 free
 ride
 so
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 focus
 for


us
 was
 on


learning
 uh
 on
 uh
 doing
 uh
 work
 within


different
 companies
 over
 time
 uh
 work


hard
 uh
 be
 interested
 um
 do
 a
 good
 job


very
 important
 who
 told
 you
 this
 I
 think


uh
 both
 uh
 my
 grandfather
 and
 uh
 my
 uh


uncle
 was
 very
 strong
 in


that
 so
 it's
 uh
 it's
 really
 about


learning
 it's


about
 uh
 showing
 that
 you
 have
 the


interest
 and
 also
 to
 perform
 is
 it
 a


burden
 uh
 if
 you
 don't
 like
 it
 it
 can
 be


a
 burden
 what
 is
 it
 that
 you
 like
 lot
 of


satisfaction
 getting
 when
 you
 see
 that


companies
 are


developing
 uh
 then
 uh
 when
 we
 can
 see


that
 actually
 uh
 the
 work
 we
 do
 with
 the


universities
 is
 actually
 moving
 things


forward
 and
 if
 you
 can
 add
 to
 both
 these


companies
 and
 to
 society
 no
 I
 always


admired
 um
 Swedish
 companies
 because


they
 are
 just
 very
 very
 impressive
 what


do
 you
 think
 what
 is
 it
 with
 um
 Sweden


which
 explains
 this
 success
 or
 or
 is


there
 something
 Swedish
 in
 it
 uh
 I
 don't


know
 if
 it's
 a
 Swedish
 trade
 but
 I
 I


think
 that
 as
 a
 country
 Sweden
 uh
 has


always
 been
 very
 dependent
 on
 trade
 uh


if
 you
 want
 to
 do
 trade
 you
 have
 to
 be


competitive
 uh
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be


competitive
 as
 a
 small
 country
 you
 have


to


innovate
 uh
 so
 this
 is
 something
 that
 I


think
 Swedish
 companies
 have
 been
 forced


to
 understand
 and
 to
 deal
 with
 over
 a


long
 time
 we
 are
 small
 countries
 um
 that


means
 that
 you
 cannot
 assume
 that
 you'll


get
 all
 the
 attention
 that
 maybe
 you


would
 like
 so
 you
 really
 have
 to
 build


the
 trust
 you
 have
 to
 be
 cost
 uh


effective
 and
 you
 have
 to
 innovate
 but


you
 managed
 to
 create
 some
 world
 leaders


in
 initially
 in
 relatively
 small
 niches


and
 then
 they
 have
 expanded
 the
 niches


right
 um


absolutely
 expanded
 their
 Technologies


expanded
 you
 know
 some
 Acquisitions
 as


well
 of
 course
 over
 time


uh
 being
 very
 International
 most
 of


these
 companies
 have
 less
 than
 10%
 of


their
 business
 in
 Sweden
 and
 uh
 that


means
 that
 you
 really
 have
 to
 understand


the
 International
 markets
 you
 have
 to


rely
 on
 free
 trade
 which
 is
 a
 perhaps


not
 an
 obvious
 question
 today
 no
 uh
 and


uh
 that
 you
 can
 as
 I
 said
 earlier
 stay


uh
 competitive
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 you
 can


adapt
 to
 the
 different
 markets
 and
 in


needs
 over
 time
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


Norwegian
 industrial
 base
 what


Reflections
 do
 you
 have
 I
 think
 that


countries
 have
 a
 tendency
 to
 to
 uh
 work


more
 and
 more
 with
 things
 that
 comes


natural
 to
 them
 you
 have
 very
 strong


Industries
 in
 terms
 of
 your
 natural


resources
 and
 fishing
 for
 example
 uh
 I'm


sure
 that
 uh
 there
 are
 areas
 other
 areas


that
 Norway
 uh
 could
 and
 will
 develop


over
 time
 such
 as


for
 example
 you
 know
 I'm
 involved
 with


the
 the
 private
 Equity
 business
 eqt


they're
 quite
 active
 here
 there
 are


number
 of
 startups
 in
 Oslo
 that
 or
 in
 in


the
 in
 Norway
 that
 are
 very
 interesting


companies
 so
 it's
 there
 there
 are


definitely
 possibilities
 Marcus
 can


there
 be
 such
 a
 thing
 as
 too
 much


responsibility
 in
 too
 few


hands
 yes
 you
 you're
 touching
 something


that
 is
 very
 very
 important
 uh
 because


you
 you


responsibility
 of
 course
 have


to
 uh
 be
 adapted
 to
 what
 can
 be
 done
 in


a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 good
 way
 uh
 so
 the
 question


is
 relevant
 um
 I
 would
 say
 that
 we
 in


the
 family
 carry
 and
 have
 carried
 a
 lot


of
 responsibility
 but
 when
 you
 talk


about
 uh
 if
 there
 is
 a
 culture
 or
 a


value
 base
 uh
 in
 our
 family
 coming
 back


to
 that
 question
 uh
 I
 would
 say
 that
 if


you
 look
 through
 the
 years
 that
 the


family
 has
 been
 active
 one
 of
 the
 key
 uh


questions
 that
 I
 can
 at
 least
 detect
 uh


is
 that
 uh
 the
 family
 has
 worked
 with


fantastic


people
 uh
 and
 uh
 it
 is
 a
 team
 play
 it's


a
 team
 sport
 uh
 one
 person
 a
 couple
 of


persons
 can't
 do
 this
 yourself
 you
 have


to
 rely
 on
 people
 that
 share
 your
 value


base
 and
 uh
 they
 have
 to
 take
 their


responsibility
 along
 your
 own


responsibility
 and
 that
 in
 itself
 is
 is


a
 responsibility
 to
 find
 these
 people


and
 to
 work
 with
 them
 for
 a
 long
 time


and
 uh
 really
 understand
 that
 you
 share


these
 ideas
 and
 the
 values
 of
 what


you're
 trying
 to
 create
 with
 the


businesses
 how
 do
 you
 work
 with
 the
 next


generation
 of
 owners
 there
 are
 about
 30


of
 them
 uh
 in
 the
 Next
 Generation
 and
 we


have
 for
 a
 number
 of
 years
 uh
 more
 than


10
 years
 uh
 worked
 with
 them
 in


different
 ways
 uh
 introducing
 them


slowly
 to
 each
 other
 and
 to
 the


businesses
 and
 to
 uh
 the
 foundations
 and


what
 the
 family
 uh
 wants
 to
 do
 uh
 some


of
 them
 have
 said
 that
 they're


interested
 to
 work
 in
 the
 business
 some


of
 them
 said
 that
 they
 would
 like
 to


work
 with
 the
 foundations
 some
 of
 them


said
 that
 I'm
 a
 happy
 family
 member
 and


that's
 fine
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 a


very
 good
 way
 of
 doing
 it
 um
 there
 is


always
 a
 balance
 with
 hoping
 that
 they


will
 get
 the
 interest
 understand
 the


necessary
 things
 you
 need
 to
 do
 as
 an


owner
 but
 I
 think
 we're
 also
 uh
 very


mindful
 that
 uh
 this
 is
 something
 if
 you


if
 you
 work
 with
 these
 things
 you
 will


have
 to
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 at
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 Demands
 on
 your
 time
 and
 so
 on
 so


you
 really
 have
 to
 like
 what
 you're


doing
 so
 gradually
 I
 you
 know
 I
 think


they
 will
 take
 more
 responsibility


uh
 and
 uh
 that's
 something
 we're
 in
 very


close
 dialogue
 with
 them
 about
 uh
 coming


on
 well
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 exciting
 to


follow
 a
 little
 while
 back
 um
 Sweden


went
 through
 a
 period
 with
 uh
 you
 know
 a


lot
 of
 wealth
 tax
 very
 high
 taxation
 and


a
 lot
 of
 very
 prominent
 swedes
 left
 the


country
 whilst
 you
 guys
 didn't
 do
 you


think
 that
 it
 would
 have
 been
 different


if
 you
 hadn't
 had
 the


foundations
 as
 an
 ownership
 structure


you
 never
 know
 of
 course
 uh
 what
 would


have
 happened
 then
 um
 but
 in
 the
 case
 of


the
 largest
 Foundation
 K
 wenber
 my
 great


uncle
 uh
 and
 his
 wife
 Alise
 a
 Norwegian


opera
 singer
 uh
 they
 had
 no
 children
 so


for
 them
 it
 was
 a
 natural
 thing
 to
 go


for
 a
 foundation
 then
 came
 the
 tax


question
 as
 you
 said
 which
 we're
 now
 I


think
 we're
 close
 to
 15
 of
 the
 family


foundations
 so
 many
 have
 now
 decided
 to


start
 foundations
 over
 the
 years
 it
 one


of
 the
 important
 things
 here
 is
 that
 as


we
 all
 know
 the
 Nordic
 way
 of
 doing


foundations
 nobody
 owns
 the
 foundation


MH
 uh
 which
 means
 that
 uh
 when
 you
 go


from
 one
 generation
 to
 another
 you're


not
 quarreling
 about
 any
 money
 because


the
 money
 will
 never
 belong
 to
 you
 so


you
 actually
 work
 for
 the
 good
 of
 the


foundations
 and
 for
 the
 companies
 uh


based
 on
 on
 your
 interest
 and
 it's
 not


there
 to
 you
 know
 fight
 or
 have
 a
 a
 big


discussion
 about
 how
 to
 find
 the
 money


here
 I
 think
 that
 has
 been
 extremely


important
 for
 our
 family
 uh
 because


those
 uh
 of
 us
 who
 decided
 to
 work
 with


the
 family
 we
 have
 done
 that
 because
 we


have
 a
 keen
 interest
 in
 doing


so
 uh
 and
 uh
 we've
 been
 lucky
 that


throughout
 the


generations
 um
 there
 have
 been
 very


qualified
 people
 in
 the
 family
 who's


been
 able
 to
 be
 there
 and
 develop
 the


business
 moving
 to
 a
 topic
 a
 bit
 here
 um


investment
 philosophy
 if
 you
 were
 to


kind
 of
 distill
 down
 what
 you
 think
 a


great
 company
 is
 what
 characterizes
 a


great
 company
 what
 would
 you
 say
 are


some
 of
 the
 characteristics
 management


Market


position
 ability
 to


innovate
 stable
 finances
 some
 of
 those


important
 things
 what
 are
 the
 most


Innovative
 companies
 in
 your
 portfolio


you
 think
 I
 hesitate
 to
 mention
 names


because
 I
 I
 think
 that
 um
 all
 of
 them


have
 to
 be
 innovative


if
 you
 are
 going
 to
 be
 successful
 in
 the


Pharma
 world
 you
 have
 to
 be
 extremely


Innovative
 such
 as
 astroica
 if
 you
 going


to
 compete
 in
 the
 Telecom
 world
 you
 have


to
 be


extremely
 uh
 Innovative
 to
 to
 stay
 ahead


uh
 but
 also
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


traditional
 engineering
 companies
 such


as
 atas
 Copco
 they
 have
 huge
 pressure
 on


themselves
 to
 innovate
 and
 innovate
 and


innovate
 uh
 so
 I
 think
 uh
 most
 of
 the


companies
 in
 our
 portfolio
 have
 that


pressure
 on
 them
 and
 that
 is
 something


that
 they
 are
 keenly
 aware
 of
 and


something
 that
 they
 are
 actually
 really


trying


to
 to
 put
 more
 and
 more
 emphasis
 on
 over


the
 years
 now
 the
 fundations
 fund


research


in
 in
 areas
 I
 mean
 really
 kind
 of
 basic


groundbreaking
 uh
 research
 where
 which


in
 many
 countries
 would
 be
 taken
 care
 of


by
 you
 know
 governments
 and
 Public


Funding
 do
 you
 do
 that
 because
 you
 think


it
 will
 be
 beneficial
 for
 the
 companies


eventually
 to
 have
 that
 type
 of
 progress


or
 what's
 the
 thinking
 behind
 the
 fields


you
 are
 choosing
 you're
 you're
 right


that
 we
 are
 funding
 primarily
 basic


research
 and
 sometimes
 high-risk


research
 right
 with
 a
 very
 uncertain


outcome
 you
 back
 uh
 people
 uh
 rather


than
 projects
 right
 50%
 is
 backing


people
 yeah
 50%
 are
 some
 large
 projects


like
 AI
 Quantum
 um
 yeah
 in
 in
 in
 in
 very


long
 dur
 a
 project
 and
 there
 not
 that


many
 institutions
 which
 think
 that
 way
 I


mean
 Howard
 Hughes
 Foundation
 is
 one


that
 comes
 to
 mind
 where
 they
 also
 do


this
 kind
 of
 binary
 outcome
 backing


people
 we're
 trying
 to
 focus
 on


Excellence
 uh
 and
 we're
 really
 uh


pushing
 that
 the
 the
 research
 that
 is


being
 performed
 is
 open
 research
 it's


for
 everybody
 the
 Swedish
 system
 is
 such


that
 the
 researcher
 owns
 the
 IP
 uh
 so
 uh


it
 it
 really
 is
 an
 open
 uh
 question
 and


and
 of
 course


this
 comes
 along
 very
 much
 Al
 line
 in


line
 with
 uh
 what
 I
 tried
 to
 describe


earlier
 namely
 if
 you
 think
 about


yourself
 that
 you
 have
 to
 innovate
 and


future
 proof
 the
 whole
 time
 also
 being


in
 a
 country
 uh
 where
 uh
 research
 and
 uh


education
 is
 a
 very
 important
 part
 that


works
 very
 well
 in
 our
 book
 in
 in
 how
 to


think
 about
 adapting
 with
 the
 times
 and


looking
 around
 the
 corner
 uh
 or
 what
 is


about
 to
 come
 how
 does
 um
 uh
 the


geopolitical


situation
 influence
 the
 way
 you
 think
 I


mean
 it's
 hard
 to
 say
 that
 we
 are
 living


in
 in
 the
 most
 difficult
 times
 so
 that


that
 that
 you
 should
 not
 do
 but
 I
 think


one
 can
 at
 least
 conclude
 that
 we're


living
 in
 extremely
 complex
 times
 yeah


uh
 and
 it's
 not
 only
 GE
 politics
 it's


also
 uh
 the
 advancement
 of
 science
 it's


a
 climate
 change
 it's
 uh
 so
 many
 things


that
 we
 have
 to
 think
 about
 in
 our


generation
 and
 I
 guess
 we're
 all
 Keen
 to


give
 something
 to
 our
 kids
 that
 is
 uh
 in


a
 good
 shape
 um
 so
 that
 impacts
 our


thinking
 a
 lot
 uh
 about
 the
 surrounding


world
 when
 I
 take
 you
 know
 from
 a
 bank


perspective
 it's
 always
 been
 around
 you


know
 the
 credit
 risk
 and
 the
 market
 risk


and
 the
 liquidity
 risk
 and
 so
 on
 that
 on


the
 balance
 sheet
 things
 but
 today
 if


you're
 a
 banker
 there
 are
 so
 many


additional
 risks
 that
 you
 have
 to


consider
 cyber
 regulatory
 political
 uh


climate
 there's
 so
 many
 different
 risks


that
 are
 now
 coming
 into
 the
 equation
 so


we
 are
 living
 in
 a
 quite
 complex
 World


from
 that
 point
 of
 view
 so
 we
 spend
 a


lot
 of
 time
 in
 the
 family
 and
 the
 people


that
 we
 work
 with
 to
 try
 to
 understand


to
 our
 best
 ability
 I
 should
 say
 uh
 what


is
 actually
 about
 to
 happen
 and
 how
 it


could
 impact
 what
 we
 do
 so
 the
 these


things
 cause
 a
 lot
 of
 volatility
 uh


sometimes
 yes
 um
 yet
 you
 are
 not
 really


utilizing
 that
 volatility
 to
 scale
 up


your
 positions
 in
 various
 companies
 for


instance
 what
 were
 the
 did
 you
 make
 a


lot
 of
 big
 active
 changes
 during
 the


financial
 crisis
 uh
 I
 think
 that
 we
 have


uh
 you
 mean
 buying
 more
 shares
 in
 well


we
 have
 about
 bought
 in
 certain


companies
 I
 think
 we
 have
 been
 taking
 a


very
 step
 bystep
 approach
 do
 you
 think


you
 should
 do
 more
 of
 this
 uh
 I
 think


that
 if
 you
 look
 at
 uh
 for
 example
 the


privately
 owned
 uh
 business
 of
 investor


which
 is
 called
 petricia


Industries
 uh
 we
 have
 been
 investing


quite
 uh
 a
 lot
 there
 in
 the
 last
 10


years
 so
 yes
 we
 are
 participating
 in


that
 uh
 so
 in
 the
 other
 holding


companies
 if
 you
 look
 at
 eqt
 they
 have


been
 extremely
 uh
 on
 their
 toes
 and
 have


created
 a
 very
 big
 business
 in
 the
 past


10
 years
 uh
 so
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 we
 have


been
 quite
 quite
 uh
 active
 perhaps
 we


have
 we're
 we're
 known
 to
 deal
 with
 some


of
 the
 very
 large
 uh
 public
 corporations


and
 as
 you
 know
 since
 you're
 an
 investor


as
 well
 uh
 it's
 not
 that
 easy
 if
 you
 are


a
 very
 major
 shareholder
 to
 move
 your


ownership
 position
 uh
 in
 these
 times
 so


uh
 we
 have
 made
 a
 number
 of
 Investments


over
 time
 and
 and
 I
 think
 we're
 quite


happy
 about
 that
 most
 recently
 increased


the
 OWN
 ship
 part
 in
 Ericson
 you


mentioned
 e
 which
 is
 uh
 for
 those
 of
 you


who
 don't
 know
 a
 very
 very
 successful


private
 Equity
 company
 which
 uh
 in
 a
 way


you
 well
 which
 you
 started
 up
 how
 did


that
 come
 about
 it
 came
 about
 that
 um
 we


got
 through
 contacts
 in
 the
 United


States
 uh
 there
 was
 a
 group
 called
 the


aea
 investors
 uh
 and
 uh
 we
 got
 to
 know


them
 and
 understood
 uh
 that
 they
 had
 a


big
 contact
 network
 with
 the
 CEOs
 of


large
 or
 us
 corporations
 who
 at
 the
 time


when
 they
 were
 leaving
 their
 companies


still
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 mileage
 left
 in
 them


and
 uh
 they
 used
 them
 to
 develop
 the


companies
 in
 the
 AA
 portfolio
 from


industrial
 point
 of
 view
 and
 that
 beame


also
 one
 of
 the
 principles
 uh
 when
 we


started
 E
 when
 Conor
 Johnson
 and
 CLA


dobeck
 uh
 and
 their
 the
 teams
 started


eqt
 uh
 and
 that
 has
 also
 followed
 their


legacy
 over
 time
 and
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 that


they've
 done
 a
 fantastic
 job
 when
 they


listed
 uh
 e
 as
 a
 company
 they've
 also


been
 able
 to
 uh
 with
 shares
 to
 get
 into


new
 businesses
 such
 as
 bearing
 Partners


in
 Asia
 and
 so
 on
 which
 have
 actually


given
 them
 a
 much
 broader
 uh
 and
 much


bigger
 platform
 uh
 in
 different
 parts
 of


the
 world
 so
 they
 have
 done
 uh
 really


well
 over
 these
 years
 and
 how
 you
 see


cuz
 we
 are
 um
 the
 the
 Norwegian
 so


wealth
 fund
 is
 in
 a
 way
 in
 somewhat


similar
 situation
 we
 have
 you
 know
 large


listed
 Holdings
 and
 then
 the
 question
 is


should
 we
 go
 into
 the
 should
 we
 be


allowed
 to
 be
 go
 into
 the
 unlisted


Market
 what
 do
 you
 think
 what
 do
 you


think
 are
 the
 arguments
 for
 having
 the


two
 in
 tandem
 I
 I
 think
 that
 we
 have


both
 learned
 uh
 from
 it
 uh
 they
 have


been
 operating
 quite
 independently
 but


we
 always
 have
 had
 in
 our
 communication


from
 both
 sides
 we
 have
 always
 talked
 to


the
 relationship
 as
 a
 very
 good
 one
 uh
 I


think
 that
 operating
 I
 think
 what
 we


have
 learned
 from
 them
 is
 how
 do
 you


operate
 uh
 in
 a
 private
 setting
 and
 what


are
 the
 important
 things
 there
 uh
 I


think
 they
 have
 taken
 a
 lot
 of
 the


values
 that
 the
 way
 we
 have
 been
 owners


in
 the
 public
 companies
 with
 them
 as


well
 uh
 and
 stand
 for
 the
 long-term


nness
 and
 trying
 to
 really
 push


Innovation
 etc
 etc
 in
 them
 so
 I
 think


yes
 it
 has
 been
 good
 to
 be
 side
 by
 side


uh
 from
 from
 my
 perspective
 it's
 been


really
 good
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 that
 the


question
 of
 learning
 is
 so
 important


because
 you
 really
 have
 to
 see
 uh
 and


what
 has
 taught
 us
 one
 thing
 with
 eqt
 is


that
 you
 can
 do
 things
 in
 a
 different


way
 and
 you
 can
 uh
 being
 in
 a
 private


setting
 uh
 you
 can
 also
 be
 more
 Nimble


in
 your
 relationship
 to
 the
 companies


and
 stay
 much
 much
 closer
 to
 them
 uh


than
 if
 you
 are
 a
 minority
 owner
 in
 a


big
 business
 you
 talk
 about
 learning
 I'm


just
 curious
 you
 are
 PR
 at
 the
 Royal


Swedish
 Academy
 of
 engineering
 yes
 what


uh
 what
 are
 you
 taking
 from
 that
 and


bringing
 into
 the
 system
 here
 I
 take


that
 you
 could
 say
 we
 call
 it
 Eva
 this


IBA
 this
 organization
 has
 it's
 the


oldest
 engineering
 Academy
 in
 uh
 the


world
 they
 have
 a
 very
 very
 strong


membership
 group
 uh
 with
 uh
 immense


knowledge
 in
 it
 everything
 that
 is
 being


done
 in
 that
 group
 is
 done
 on
 a
 pro
 bono


basis
 uh
 by
 doing
 this
 uh
 this


organization
 has
 the
 possibility
 to
 uh


help
 out
 uh
 in
 Sweden
 so
 society
 when


difficult
 discussions
 are
 there
 about


the
 future
 I
 mean
 for
 example
 how
 should


we
 think
 about
 our
 energy
 uh
 situation


uh
 what
 other
 policy
 measures
 do
 we
 need


to
 do
 uh
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 Sweden
 stays


uh


competitive
 uh
 so
 questions
 like
 that
 so


we
 we
 engage
 in
 different
 projects
 and


our


members
 uh
 can
 and
 will
 uh
 give
 their


free
 time
 to
 help
 out
 in
 and
 doing
 that


and
 then
 we
 have
 the
 possibility
 to
 have


discussion
 with
 government
 and
 give
 our


input
 into
 the
 political
 debate
 so
 it


really
 uh
 we
 we
 often
 think
 about
 in


Sweden
 we
 talk
 very
 much
 about
 triple


helix
 namely
 the
 relationship
 between


government
 business
 and
 Academia
 and
 you


could
 say
 that
 this
 organization
 Eva
 is


really
 at
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 this


discussion
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 creating


this
 Helix
 between
 government
 private


and
 Academia
 I
 think
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 key


aspects
 is
 to
 be
 open
 open
 to
 the


discussion
 uh
 open
 to
 that
 uh
 you
 try
 to


bring
 in
 competence
 uh
 around
 certain


questions


that
 can
 actually
 be
 helpful
 for
 the


development
 of
 the
 country
 and
 having


that
 openness
 toward
 uh
 listening
 to


each
 other
 and
 taking
 some
 uh
 advice


hopefully
 uh
 into
 the
 process
 of


decision-
 making
 for
 for
 example
 in


politics
 moving
 on
 to
 uh
 to
 leadership


Marcus
 you
 are
 uh
 widely
 considered
 the


person
 in
 this
 part
 of
 the
 world
 with


the
 biggest
 rodex
 and
 uh
 many
 of
 the


people
 who
 listen
 to
 this
 call
 wouldn't


know
 what
 a
 Rolodex
 is
 but
 it
 was


something
 in
 the
 old
 days
 which
 we
 had


at
 our
 at
 our
 desks
 and
 you
 stuffed
 your


business
 cards
 into
 it
 so
 you
 could


easily
 find
 them
 so
 basically
 not
 a
 word


for
 having
 a
 a
 tremendous
 Network
 why


why
 is
 Network
 important
 number
 one
 of


course
 uh
 opportunities
 that
 you
 may
 be


introduced
 to


um
 I
 think
 that
 the
 network
 and
 to


understand
 what
 is
 actually
 happening


around
 the
 world
 is
 for
 us
 since
 we
 are


close
 to
 businesses
 with
 global


businesses
 uh
 it
 is
 a
 very
 essential


part
 that
 you


actually
 have
 people
 that
 you
 can
 talk


to
 in
 different
 parts
 of
 the
 world
 ask


for
 advice
 listening
 to
 what
 is
 actually


their
 viewpoints
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 do


over
 a
 zoom
 call
 you
 have
 to
 spend
 time


getting
 to
 know
 these
 people
 getting
 to


know
 them
 uh
 in
 times
 when
 when
 you


maybe
 not
 need
 their
 help
 because
 one


day
 you
 may
 need
 their
 help
 with


something
 uh
 and
 then
 it's
 very
 good
 to


have
 that
 Network
 and
 what's
 the
 key
 to


maintaining
 it
 it's
 like
 everything
 else


ncol
 it's
 like
 um
 just
 hard
 work
 but
 you


also
 have
 to
 like
 that
 part
 of
 it


because
 uh
 at
 least
 that
 that
 is


something
 you
 know
 getting
 to
 know


people
 with
 uh
 all
 these
 abilities
 is


extremely
 stimulating
 what
 is
 it
 that


you
 like
 with
 it
 the
 challenges
 in
 my


mind
 the
 whole
 time
 who
 are
 some
 of
 the


most
 surprising
 fun
 people
 you
 met


lately
 oh
 many


um
 I
 met
 a
 composer
 the
 other
 day
 a


young
 composer
 in


Sweden
 uh
 I
 met
 one
 of
 the
 founders
 in


Mistral
 which
 is
 you
 know
 the
 a
 French


AI
 company
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 uh
 most


forward
 I'm
 a
 lucky
 person
 from
 that


point
 of
 view
 would
 you
 take
 away
 uh


from
 from
 these
 things
 into
 business
 I


do
 you
 get
 inspiration
 from
 a
 lot
 of


non-
 business
 related
 one
 thing
 that
 is


you
 know
 we
 spoke
 about


geopolitics
 uh
 that's
 a
 necessity
 to


hear
 what's
 going
 on
 um
 that's
 one
 side


of
 it
 but
 I
 also
 believe
 that
 um
 in
 this


era
 of
 dramatic
 technological
 and


scientific
 change
 you
 really
 have


to
 understand
 that
 the
 ability
 to
 use


these


Technologies
 across
 different
 fields
 of


interest
 is
 some
 think
 that
 is
 uh
 very


very
 important
 if
 you're
 not
 out
 there


listening
 to
 those
 people
 who
 do
 this
 on


a
 daily
 basis
 and
 also
 see
 the
 same


thing
 it's
 difficult
 to
 understand
 that


you
 do
 need
 to
 change
 and
 you
 do
 need
 to


advance
 things
 I've
 heard
 you
 say
 that


good
 leadership
 depends
 on
 the
 situation


you
 lead
 through
 yes
 uh
 but
 is
 there
 a


common
 denominator
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 good


leadership
 sure
 I
 I
 mean
 uh
 the


engagement


the
 uh
 the
 energy
 the
 knowledge
 the


Judgment
 strength
 to
 carry
 on
 also
 in


difficult
 times
 and
 lead
 people
 through


difficult
 times
 but
 also
 lead
 people
 in


times
 of
 great
 expansion
 that's
 why
 it's


so
 important
 to
 have
 people
 uh
 in


leadership
 positions
 who
 is
 also
 there


at
 that
 particular
 time
 for
 a
 certain


company
 because
 sometimes
 you
 have
 to


companies
 need
 to
 go
 through
 a
 very


difficult
 period
 that
 may
 be
 a
 very


different
 leader
 from
 somebody
 from
 a


company
 who
 are
 in
 a
 strong
 strong


expansion
 phase
 has
 good
 leadership


changed
 you
 think
 of
 the
 last
 10
 years


does
 it
 take
 something
 else
 to
 be
 a
 good


leader
 now
 I'm
 not
 sure
 actually
 I
 I
 I


think


that
 leadership
 uh
 the
 qualities
 of


leadership
 Still
 Remains
 to
 a
 certain
 to


to
 most
 extent
 but
 I
 I
 think
 that
 the


way
 you
 apply
 it
 has
 probably
 changed
 in


what
 way
 with
 technology
 no
 but
 I
 mean


think
 about
 some
 of
 these
 multinational


corporations
 uh
 they
 can
 actually
 do
 uh


they
 don't
 have
 to
 do
 all
 staff
 meetings


by
 going
 to
 certain
 countries
 they
 can


do
 three
 old
 staff
 meetings
 over
 Zoom
 uh


without
 moving
 and
 and
 then
 they
 cover


all
 the
 time
 zones
 so
 it
 it
 it
 it
 helps


you
 uh
 to
 run
 the
 companies
 in
 a
 very


different
 way
 uh
 you
 can
 use
 uh
 you
 know


the
 the
 corporate
 version
 of
 Facebook
 or


whatever
 to
 communicate
 between


different
 groups
 uh
 that
 work
 with


different
 projects
 in
 in
 multinational


corporations
 so
 yes
 you
 can
 apply
 these


things
 in
 a
 very
 very
 different
 way
 do


you
 think
 it's
 tougher
 to
 be
 a
 CEO
 now


than
 what
 it
 was
 in
 the
 past
 I
 think


it's
 it's
 uh
 for
 a
 multinational


corporation
 in
 a
 for
 example
 high


technology
 company
 the
 demands
 have
 gone


up
 yeah
 what
 what
 what
 part
 of
 it
 is


tougher
 uh
 I
 think
 uh
 the
 speed
 of


change
 is
 a
 very
 big
 factor
 here
 M
 and


uh
 but
 also
 you
 know
 running
 a
 bank
 or


running
 a
 Pharma
 company
 you
 have
 to


keep
 your
 energy
 going
 what's
 the


toughest
 time
 you
 have
 had
 personally
 in


terms
 of
 businesses
 I
 gone
 through
 a


number


of
 uh
 seen
 the
 number
 of
 Crisis


situations
 personally
 uh
 loss
 of
 family


members
 is
 usually
 a
 tough
 thing
 how
 did


you
 cope
 with
 it
 I
 uh
 have
 learned
 uh


that
 you
 you
 have
 to
 realize
 it's
 part


of
 your
 life
 you
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 it
 as


it
 is
 and
 you
 have
 to
 think


positively
 because
 there
 are
 so
 many


positive
 things
 in
 life
 so
 it's
 a
 very


very
 important
 part
 of
 that
 to
 think


positively
 and
 to
 see
 the
 many
 many
 good


things
 on
 what
 goes
 on
 it
 takes
 a
 strong


mindset
 to
 to
 have
 that
 attitude
 um
 but


what
 um
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 um


developing
 leaders
 within
 the
 wck
 sphere


uh
 moving
 people
 from
 uh
 you
 know
 one


company
 to
 the
 other
 company
 is
 cross


yeah
 is
 cross
 fer
 fation
 very
 important


extremely
 uh
 if
 we
 can
 do
 it
 uh
 I
 think


some
 of
 the
 great
 leaders
 are
 those
 who


have
 uh
 the
 ability
 to
 have
 seen


different
 things
 you
 can
 see
 for
 example


bu
 eom
 who's
 now
 running
 Ericson
 did
 a


very
 good
 job
 at
 er
 at
 the
 investor


before
 that
 uh
 and
 uh
 if
 you
 look


historically
 into
 our
 group
 the
 people


who
 have
 been
 very
 helpful
 in
 helping


the
 family
 over
 the
 years
 they
 all
 did


uh
 a
 multitude
 of
 things
 Atlas
 seems
 to


be
 some
 kind
 of
 CEO
 Factory
 it
 uh
 yes


they've
 done
 they've
 done
 really
 really


well
 and
 why
 what
 is
 it
 with
 Atlas
 uh


one
 of
 the
 aspects
 I
 think
 with
 Atlas
 is


that
 they
 in
 their
 corporate
 structure


they
 have
 pushed
 so
 much
 responsibility


into
 different
 parts
 of
 the
 group
 they


they're
 really
 very
 firm
 on
 people
 even


for
 small
 businesses
 to
 take
 full


responsibility
 and
 that
 has
 created
 many


good
 leaders
 in
 that
 company
 and
 for


those
 of
 you
 who
 haven't
 heard
 it
 we


have
 also
 done
 a
 podcast
 with
 the
 ex
 CEO


of
 Atlas
 where
 we
 talk
 about
 these
 kind


of
 things
 M
 absolutely
 really
 really
 uh


fascinating
 and
 then
 you
 move
 them
 on
 to


become
 chair
 after
 a
 while
 how
 does
 that


work
 that's
 been
 generally
 a
 very
 very


good
 thing
 um
 because
 having
 worked
 with


some
 of
 these
 CEOs
 over
 many
 years
 uh


and
 uh
 then
 we
 gotten
 to
 know
 each
 other


uh
 we
 know
 know
 that
 we
 share
 values
 uh


which
 is
 very
 important
 when
 they
 take


on
 chairs
 chair
 mes
 what
 makes
 a
 chair


effective
 what's
 the
 best
 chair
 you've


seen
 apart
 from
 apart
 from
 yourself
 of


[Laughter]


course
 uh
 I've
 seen
 I
 I've
 seen
 many


Fantastic
 chairs
 what
 makes
 them


effective
 uh
 I
 think
 the
 uh
 presence
 you


know
 applying
 their
 wisdom
 and
 and


experiences
 really
 forward
 looking
 uh


all
 Al
 knowing
 where
 things
 can
 go
 wrong


and
 see
 to
 you
 know
 to
 address
 those


subjects
 with
 the
 management
 very
 when


you
 say
 presence
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 I
 I


believe
 that
 uh
 good
 shairs
 usually


engage
 themselves
 with
 the


companies
 uh
 quite
 a
 bit
 uh
 even
 in
 the


setting
 I
 mean
 this
 of
 course
 depends
 in


which
 jurisdiction
 you're
 working


because
 in
 in
 many
 many
 jurisdictions
 uh


many
 capital
 markets
 chairs
 are
 much


much
 closer
 they're
 almost
 half


executive


but
 uh
 in
 the
 Swedish
 or
 the
 Nordic
 way


of
 doing
 it
 then
 of
 course
 we
 have


nonexecutive
 chairs
 uh
 but
 those
 chairs


who
 stay
 very
 close
 to
 the
 companies
 to


the
 managements
 uh
 I
 think
 tend
 to
 do


very
 well
 in
 our
 part
 of
 the
 world
 we


split
 the
 the
 chair
 and
 the
 COO
 role
 yes


is
 that
 important
 uh
 I
 think
 uh
 that
 has


worked
 out
 really
 well
 for
 us
 yeah
 and


why
 does
 it
 why
 do
 they
 still
 keep
 the


other
 way
 of
 doing
 it
 in
 America
 for


instance
 well
 it's
 interesting
 question


because
 they
 seem
 to
 be
 doing
 quite
 well


as
 well
 and
 and
 so
 there
 maybe
 not
 any


colum
 egg
 here
 but
 I
 I
 I
 think
 that
 I


think
 what
 speaks
 to
 our
 model
 uh
 which


is
 is
 very
 good
 is
 that
 also


CEO
 needs
 somebody
 to
 talk


to
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 those
 relationships


where
 CEOs
 and
 chairs
 have
 that


relationship
 where
 uh
 because
 it
 running


a
 company
 can
 also
 be
 quite
 lonely


absolutely
 absolutely
 and
 uh
 therefore
 I


think
 that
 model
 Works
 uh
 it
 also
 works


because
 uh
 chairs
 can
 both
 Challenge
 and


support
 when
 they
 get
 close
 but
 that
 you


know
 that
 of
 course
 demands
 that
 the


chairs
 have
 enough
 time
 to
 spend
 with


the
 companies
 and
 really
 understand


what's
 going
 on
 now
 in
 um
 uh
 in
 our
 fund


we
 have
 the
 view
 that
 one
 share
 should


have
 one
 vote
 uh
 but
 you
 don't
 quite


share
 that
 view
 could
 you
 you
 mind
 just


explaining
 how
 you
 how
 you
 look
 at
 it
 uh


I
 look
 upon
 it
 this
 way
 that
 uh
 it


happens
 I
 mean
 at
 at
 the
 base
 of
 it
 it's


a
 contractual
 right
 uh
 these
 companies


that
 have
 it
 have
 have
 made
 an
 agreement


at
 one
 point
 in
 time
 yeah
 to
 uh
 have


that
 it
 has
 very
 often
 been
 situations


where
 uh
 companies
 have
 been
 developed


by
 by
 entrepreneurs
 who
 uh
 needed
 to
 go


for
 more
 capital
 and
 uh
 doing
 so
 found


that
 their
 presence
 and
 their


possibility
 to
 influence
 was
 very
 very


important
 uh
 and
 the
 U
 and
 the
 investors


at
 the
 time
 uh
 thought
 that
 also
 that


was
 a
 very
 important
 idea
 uh
 I
 think


that
 in
 our
 part
 of
 the
 world
 uh
 we
 have


a
 very
 very
 transparent
 system
 around


this
 you
 are
 free
 as
 an
 investor
 to
 buy


the
 type
 of
 share
 that
 you
 want
 to
 buy


you
 can
 decide
 if
 you
 want
 to
 buy
 into


that
 company
 or
 not
 I
 realize
 that
 some


people
 may
 not
 want
 to
 invest
 in
 that


kind
 of
 company
 but
 I
 I
 think
 there
 is
 a


very
 big
 question
 of
 contractual
 right


uh
 and
 how
 you
 uh
 look
 upon
 that
 as
 as


an
 important
 factor
 of
 doing
 business


well
 we
 typically
 vote
 against
 these


kind
 of
 things
 right
 but
 in
 the
 case
 of


the
 wenberg
 companies
 we
 don't
 because


it
 was
 in
 place
 when
 we
 bought
 the


shares
 and
 we
 went
 into
 it
 with
 open


eyes
 and
 so
 so
 we
 are
 we
 are
 not
 making


uh
 too
 much
 noise
 here
 now
 rounding
 off


um
 we
 have
 a
 couple
 of
 uh
 uh
 ways
 of
 uh


relaxing
 in
 common
 um
 sailing
 and


CrossCountry
 skiing
 yes
 tell
 me
 about
 it


because
 I
 know
 you
 have
 a
 see
 a
 smile
 on


your
 face
 here


so
 why
 not
 the
 first
 time
 uh
 uh
 no
 what


is
 it
 it's
 it's
 about
 the
 vast
 expanse


isn't
 it
 yeah
 yeah
 it's
 the
 vast
 expans


yeah
 being
 on
 the
 ocean
 or
 being
 up
 in


the
 the
 mountains
 and
 uh
 I
 find
 that
 to


be
 uh
 very
 good
 for
 my
 mind
 at
 least
 so


I
 read
 a
 book
 on
 architecture
 and
 uh
 one


of
 the
 keys
 to
 good
 architecture
 is
 the


combination
 of
 repetition
 and
 variation


and
 I
 think
 both
 thec
 and
 cross
 country


skiing
 area
 have
 that
 I
 agree
 and
 I
 I
 in


addition
 to
 that
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 some


sports
 or
 some
 activities
 actually
 helps


your
 mind
 yeah
 to
 think
 about
 something


different
 uh
 than
 than
 what
 you
 usually


do
 and
 I
 I
 I
 do
 believe
 that
 is
 maybe


the
 most
 important
 way
 to
 refresh
 your


brain
 is
 that
 you
 keep
 your
 mind
 on


something
 different
 what
 do
 you
 read


many
 different
 things
 actually
 uh


history
 current


situations
 uh
 I'm
 actually
 reading
 right


now
 a
 book
 on
 Swedish
 Finnish


relationship


back
 uh
 from
 the
 1800s
 to
 now
 very


interesting
 especially
 in
 the
 time
 that


we
 live
 in
 right
 now
 and
 um
 what's
 your


advice
 to
 young
 people
 stay
 curious
 work


hard
 follow
 your
 interests
 get
 a
 good


boss
 sounds
 like
 a
 good
 plan
 and
 sounds


like
 the
 people
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 W


companies
 have
 a
 really
 good
 boss
 in
 you


uh
 big
 thanks
 for
 being
 here
 it's


incredibly
 impressive
 what
 your
 family


have
 achieved
 over
 the
 last
 150
 years


thank
 you
 and
 thanks
 for
 having
 me


pleasure
