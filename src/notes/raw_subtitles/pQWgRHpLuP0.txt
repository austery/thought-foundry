Hey
 everybody,
 welcome
 back
 to
 the


channel.
 We
 are
 back
 on
 another
 episode


of
 the
 daily
 recap.
 First
 daily
 recap


for
 the
 week.
 Missed
 yesterday
 because
 I


was
 with
 my
 family
 for
 Dvali.
 Happy


Dvali
 to
 all
 those
 that
 celebrate.
 Uh


been
 a
 pretty
 crazy
 two
 days
 as
 we
 start


off
 this
 week
 in
 the
 stock
 market.
 We


officially
 have
 big
 tech
 earnings
 that


begin
 today.
 Netflix,
 we'll
 talk
 about


Netflix
 results.
 Down
 5%
 after
 hours.


Wasn't
 the
 best
 earnings,
 wasn't
 the


worst
 earnings,
 but
 we'll
 talk
 about


that.
 Amazon,
 Google,
 and
 OpenAI,
 all


three
 of
 them.
 Tons
 of
 different


announcements
 today.
 We'll
 talk
 about


those.
 Trump
 made
 some
 more
 comments
 on


China
 as
 always.
 Hopefully,
 this


negotiations
 will
 be
 starting
 soon,


which
 we'll
 be
 discussing
 as
 we
 get
 into


the
 end
 of
 October.
 Uh,
 and
 then
 the


other
 main
 thing
 that
 we
 got
 to
 talk


about
 today
 is
 gold.
 Gold
 is
 going
 down.


Lost
 its
 worst
 amount
 of
 market
 cap,


1.75
 trillion
 with
 a
 T
 since
 April
 2013.


At
 the
 same
 time,
 the
 S&P
 500
 basically


all-time
 highs.
 Dow
 Jones
 was
 like
 40


bucks
 away
 from
 all-time
 highs.
 and
 a


lot
 of
 the
 Oaklows
 and
 Quantum
 stocks


and
 nuclear
 names
 and
 drone
 stocks
 and


big
 bear
 AIs
 took
 a
 hit
 today.
 We
 got
 to


talk
 about
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 the


broader
 market,
 what's
 going
 on
 with


commodities,
 and
 what's
 going
 on
 with


these
 momentum
 plays
 that
 might
 be


losing
 some
 momentum.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it.


Okay,
 so
 let's
 get
 started
 with
 what's


going
 on
 in
 the
 broader
 market
 in


regards
 to
 some
 of these
 momentum
 stocks


because
 I
 think
 it
 is
 very
 very


important
 to
 talk
 about
 this.
 So
 over


the
 past
 week,
 Oaklow
 is
 down
 10%,


D-Wave
 down
 27,
 Big
 Bear
 down
 21,


Regetti
 down
 27,
 andQ
 down
 29,
 SM
 SMR


down
 14,
 nanuclear
 down
 22,
 MP
 and
 US


AR,
 rare
 earth
 companies,
 MP
 is
 down


25%,
 US
 AR
 is
 down
 20%.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


other
 names
 on
 that
 list.
 Ondos
 down


30%,
 we
 can
 go
 through
 a
 variety
 of


different
 names
 that
 have
 essentially


picked
 up
 tons
 of
 momentum
 over
 the
 past


couple
 of
 weeks,
 really
 the
 the
 past


couple
 of
 months.
 They're
 all
 getting


hit.
 Now,
 here's
 the
 question
 and
 and


then then
 I
 want
 to
 get
 to
 my
 opinion
 on


kind
 of
 what's
 happening
 right
 here.
 I


would
 love
 to
 know
 what
 people
 think
 in


the
 comments.
 Do
 you
 think
 the
 decline


we're
 seeing
 in
 some
 of
 these
 names
 that


don't
 really
 have
 the
 most
 earnings


potential,
 revenue
 potential?
 I
 mean,


they're
 not
 really
 showing
 anything


other
 than
 the
 narrative
 Big
 Bear
 AI
 is


guiding
 to
 negative,
 let
 me
 say
 that


again,
 negative
 5%
 growth
 in
 the
 sector


where
 companies
 are
 growing
 over
 50%,


which
 is
 AI.
 So,
 you've
 got
 companies


that
 have
 AI
 in
 their
 ticker
 that
 cannot


grow
 at
 all.
 They're
 negative
 growing


this
 year
 that
 are
 up
 80%
 year
 to
 date.


A
 lot
 of
 these
 companies
 are
 not
 the


worst
 companies
 in
 the
 world,
 but
 they


are
 companies
 that
 have
 been
 essentially


cultivated
 by
 a
 narrative.
 That


narrative
 has
 not
 resulted
 in
 any


meaningful
 earnings
 growth,
 any


meaningful
 revenue
 growth.
 But
 those


stocks,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 all
 of
 them,
 a


lot
 of
 them
 are
 up
 four
 to
 5x
 a
 year
 to


date.
 I
 mean,
 it
 is
 quite
 incredible.
 My


question
 to
 everyone
 here
 is
 do
 you


think
 the
 momentum
 that
 is
 dying
 out


objectively
 which
 it
 you
 know
 so
 far


we've
 seen
 no
 real
 reversal
 of
 that


momentum
 coming
 back
 is
 that
 a


structural
 momentum
 decline
 in
 these


stocks
 or
 are
 they
 taking
 a
 breather?
 My


take
 on
 this
 is
 that
 I
 don't
 know
 and
 I


don't
 think
 anyone
 can
 really
 know.


We're
 all
 just
 guessing
 here
 in
 terms
 of


what's
 or
 how
 this
 is
 playing
 out.
 But


if
 you
 have
 to
 look
 at
 some
 of
 the
 data


that
 we're
 getting,
 it
 does
 feel
 like


they're
 losing
 more
 momentum
 than
 not.


The
 reason
 they're
 losing
 momentum
 is


because,
 simply
 put,
 they've
 gone
 up
 a


lot
 and
 people
 want
 to
 take
 some


profits.
 And
 when
 you
 have
 a
 stock
 that


goes
 up
 a
 lot
 like
 an
 Nvidia,
 and
 it


can,
 you
 know,
 keep
 putting
 up
 earnings


growth,
 you
 might
 have
 people
 that
 might


not
 want
 to
 take
 some
 profits.
 I've
 not


sold
 a
 single
 share
 of
 Nvidia
 all
 year.


My
 average
 is
 122,
 stocks
 at
 180.
 I'm
 up


50%.
 But
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 sell
 because
 I


think
 Nvidia
 can
 continue
 the
 earnings


growth.
 For
 a
 lot
 of these
 names,
 if
 you


bought
 it
 off
 the
 idea
 that,
 well,


Oakllo
 is
 going
 to
 be
 big
 because
 it's


nuclear
 energy
 and
 we
 need
 nuclear


energy,
 there's
 nothing
 really
 holding


you
 into
 the
 narrative
 outside
 of
 that


one
 sentence.
 There's
 no
 earnings,


there's
 no
 revenue,
 there's
 not
 any
 of


these
 massive
 deals,
 and
 you
 know,
 there


have
 deals
 in
 the
 pipeline,
 but
 it's
 not


manifesting
 anything
 you
 can
 tangibly


say
 is
 actually
 helping
 the
 company


right
 now.
 Same
 thing
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 the


quantum
 names.
 And
 again,
 this
 is
 not


being
 bearish
 or
 skeptical
 of
 all
 these


different
 companies
 that
 are
 out
 there.


I
 don't
 have
 positions
 on
 them.
 I
 don't


have
 shorts
 on
 them.
 I
 don't
 have
 puts


on
 them.
 It's
 not
 to
 say
 that.
 It's


rather
 saying,
 hey,
 for
 the
 health
 of


this
 bull
 market,
 can
 we
 figure
 out,
 do


these
 names
 have
 the
 validity,
 the


legitimacy
 to
 keep
 going
 higher?
 And
 the


the
 thing
 about
 momentum
 is
 that
 when


momentum
 dies,
 we
 were
 talking
 about


this
 last
 week,
 it's
 really
 hard
 to
 get


it
 back.
 It's
 re
 the
 only
 way
 you
 get
 it


back
 is
 if
 you
 put
 up
 good
 earnings


growth.
 Pounder
 and
 Robin
 Hood
 were


momentum
 stocks
 back
 in
 23
 24.
 would
 not


have
 had
 the
 2025
 they
 had
 if
 those


companies
 did
 not
 put
 up
 the
 gigantics


earnings
 growth.
 Both
 of
 them
 over
 50%


that
 they
 did
 in
 the
 past
 nine
 months.


And
 so
 you
 can
 disagree
 with
 Palantra's


multiple.
 You
 can
 disagree
 with
 Hood's


multiple.
 You
 can
 disagree
 with
 freaking


Apple's
 multiple.
 Apple
 trading
 at
 35


times
 earnings
 growing
 like
 5%
 a
 year.


You
 can't
 say
 they
 don't
 deserve
 a


multiple
 because
 they
 are
 growing
 and


they
 are
 buying
 back
 stock.
 Apple
 with


100
 billion
 and
 they
 are
 quality


companies
 that
 are
 putting
 out
 products


and
 services
 in
 the
 world
 that
 really
 do


matter.
 Aka
 they
 have
 a
 moat.
 A
 lot
 of


these
 other
 stocks
 don't
 really
 have
 a


moat,
 don't
 really
 have
 earnings.
 A
 lot


of
 them
 don't
 have
 revenue.
 They


essentially
 got
 bid
 up
 in
 the
 span
 of


over
 basically
 call
 it
 two
 months.
 I


know
 year
 to
 date
 they've
 done
 very
 very


well,
 but
 over
 the
 past
 two
 months


that's
 where
 they
 really
 got
 the
 bid
 and


that
 bid
 might
 be
 fading.
 And
 so
 I
 think


it's
 important
 for
 all
 of
 us
 to
 just


understand
 what
 is
 happening
 right
 now.


The
 S&P
 500
 is
 $2
 away
 from
 alltime


highs.
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 stocks
 that
 were


up
 30
 to
 40%
 when
 the
 S&P
 500
 was
 at


all-time
 highs
 two
 weeks
 ago
 are
 down
 30


to
 40%.
 The
 S&P
 500
 is
 barely
 down
 1%.


Nvidia
 back
 to
 180.
 I
 mean,
 yes,
 it's


down
 from
 195
 to
 180.
 But
 Nvidia
 has
 not


collapsed.
 Palunter
 has
 not
 collapsed.


Robin
 Hood's
 not
 collapsed.
 Yes,
 down


from
 150
 to
 130,
 but
 Palter's
 up
 from
 or


Hood's
 up
 from
 97
 to
 130
 after
 S&P


inclusion.
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 pretty
 big


run
 for
 Robin
 Hood,
 but
 did
 it
 deserve


150?
 Probably
 not.
 So,
 it's
 taking
 a


breather.
 Some
 of
 these
 stocks,
 I
 don't


know
 if
 they're
 taking
 breathers
 or


structurally
 they've
 lost
 the
 bid


because
 once
 you've
 lost
 the
 bid,
 once


you've
 lost
 the
 momentum,
 once
 you've


lost
 the
 narrative,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 really


hard
 to
 get
 it
 back.
 And
 so,
 that
 is
 my


question
 to
 everybody.
 My
 final
 take
 on


this
 is
 very
 simple.
 I
 think
 to
 keep
 the


bull
 market
 going,
 you
 need
 quality


companies
 like
 an
 AMD
 or
 an
 Apple
 that


hit
 all-time
 highs
 yesterday
 to
 get


those
 all-time
 highs.
 You
 cannot
 have
 a


meaningful
 bull
 run
 when
 you
 have
 lots


of
 stocks.
 There's
 like
 over
 30
 to
 40
 of


them
 that
 run
 up
 for
 no
 reason.
 And


again,
 those
 stocks
 could
 go
 to
 zero,


doesn't
 affect
 the
 broader
 market.
 Those


stocks
 could
 go
 up
 to,
 you
 know,
 30,
 40


billion
 market
 cap.
 Probably
 still


doesn't
 affect
 the
 broader
 market.
 But


it's
 not
 healthy.
 We
 know
 it's
 not


healthy.
 If
 we're
 if
 if
 we're
 not,
 you


know,
 kidding,
 if
 we're
 calling
 a
 spade


a
 spade,
 we're
 not
 kidding
 with


ourselves.
 We
 know
 that's
 not
 healthy.


And
 so,
 it's
 not
 about
 being
 bearish
 the


market.
 It's
 ironically
 being
 as
 bullish


as
 you
 can
 about
 the
 market.
 And
 to
 keep


that
 bull
 market
 momentum
 going,


everything
 shouldn't
 be
 running
 for
 the


hell
 of
 running.
 That
 is
 not
 a
 bull


market.
 That
 is
 a
 bubble.
 That
 is
 a
 top.


That
 is
 euphoric.
 That
 is
 what
 we
 saw
 in


the.com
 bubble
 and
 in
 2021.
 And
 given


most
 of
 us
 live
 through
 2021,
 you
 know,


not
 everyone
 lived
 through
 2008
 or
 the


docom
 bubble.
 But
 2021,
 these
 stocks


didn't
 deserve
 their
 mult
 multiple.
 They


got
 the
 multiple.
 And
 we're
 not
 just


talking
 about
 the
 random
 stocks.
 We're


talking
 about
 the
 metas,
 Amazons,
 etc.


The
 fact
 that
 those
 stocks,
 Meta,


Amazon,
 Google,
 etc.
 are
 not
 getting
 a


massive
 multiple.
 But
 these
 random


stocks
 are
 getting
 a
 massive
 multiple
 I


think
 is
 bullish
 because
 it
 means


there's
 not
 a
 bubble
 in
 the
 big
 stocks.


And
 now
 if
 those
 random
 stocks
 can
 lose


their
 froth
 and
 the
 big
 stocks
 can


slowly
 continue
 to
 expand
 their
 multiple


because
 it's
 justified
 on
 earnings


growth.
 I
 think
 that's
 one
 of the
 best


case
 scenarios
 for
 the
 broader
 market.


But
 very
 curious
 to
 hear
 what
 people


think.
 Momentum
 stocks
 potentially


losing
 their
 losing
 their
 momentum
 might


end
 up
 coming
 back.
 But
 we're
 going
 to


have
 to
 give
 it
 a
 lot
 more
 time
 to
 see


what
 the
 data
 tells
 us.
 Okay,
 next
 up
 is


what's
 going
 on
 with
 Amazon,
 Google,
 and


OpenAI.
 So
 Google
 fell
 intraday
 to
 245.


We
 were
 actually
 live
 when
 the
 market


open.
 I
 think
 it
 actually
 got
 to
 244


when
 this
 happened.
 OpenAI
 announced
 a


new
 browser


uh
 called
 Atlas.
 And
 when
 the
 browser


was
 announced,
 everyone
 shrugged.


Anyway,
 so
 the
 uh
 you
 know,
 the
 browser


I
 thought
 was
 kind
 of
 interesting.
 I'm
 a


bit
 skeptical
 on
 the
 idea
 of
 the
 browser


really
 mattering.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 use


Chrome.
 I'm
 sure
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 use


Chrome,


Safari,
 Microsoft
 Edge.
 I
 mean
 like
 it's


just
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where
 for
 us
 to


switch
 to
 a
 new
 browser
 and
 when
 I
 mean


us
 I
 mean
 us
 as
 consumers
 because
 of


some
 AI
 bot
 on
 the
 side
 that
 you
 can
 ask


questions
 to
 based
 on
 whatever
 web
 page


you're
 on
 which
 is
 essentially
 what


Perplexity
 launched
 and
 I
 tried
 it.
 I


liked
 it.
 It
 was
 cool.
 It
 didn't
 get
 me


to
 use
 stop
 using
 Chrome.
 This
 OpenAI


thing
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I'm
 going
 to


actually
 stop
 using
 Chrome
 especially


when
 Chrome
 adds
 it
 to
 their
 browser.


Like
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 new
 innovations
 I'm


seeing
 by
 some
 of
 these
 companies.
 You


look
 at
 big
 tech
 and
 you're
 like
 man
 big


tech's
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that
 and


they
 have
 the
 distribution
 which
 is
 the


most
 important
 thing
 in
 the
 world.


Ironically,
 Austin
 made
 a
 good
 point
 in


the
 chat
 today
 that
 Microsoft
 Bing
 is
 a


browser,
 Microsoft
 Edge,
 but
 Bing
 is


like
 their
 search
 thing
 uh
 for


Microsoft.
 The
 fact
 that
 OpenAI
 is
 not


working
 on
 making
 that
 better
 and
 like


interacting
 with
 Microsoft
 to
 like


already
 serve
 the
 distribution
 that


Microsoft
 has,
 which
 is
 pretty
 massive,


just
 means
 that
 OpenAI
 doesn't
 care


about
 Microsoft
 and
 this
 relationship


with
 Nadella
 might
 not
 be
 as
 good
 as
 it


seems
 in
 terms
 of
 a
 working


relationship.
 And
 so,
 they're
 doing
 it


on
 their
 own.
 Google
 fell
 to
 244.


Google's
 back
 up
 to
 252.
 In
 fact,


Google's
 even
 more
 green
 after
 hours


because
 there
 is
 a
 rumor
 from
 Bloomberg


that
 Anthropic,
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the


leading
 LLM
 companies,
 is
 now
 going
 to


be
 working
 with
 Google
 for
 a
 cloud


contract
 which
 will
 include
 tens
 and


tens
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars.
 That
 is
 the


exact
 headline
 that
 we
 have.
 Google


right
 now
 after
 hours
 is
 up
 2%
 at
 25575.


I
 think
 that's
 really
 interesting.
 And


the
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 that's
 really


interesting
 as
 well
 is
 because
 Amazon


already
 has
 a
 deep
 relationship
 with


Google.
 Amazon's
 actually
 down
 one
 and a


half%
 after
 hours.
 Amazon
 was
 up
 almost


3%
 on
 the
 day.
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 froth


momentum
 stock
 potentially,
 you
 know,


people
 took
 profits
 and
 got
 into


something
 safer
 like
 an
 Amazon,
 but


Amazon's
 down
 after
 hours
 because


Anthropic,
 which
 they
 own
 a
 majority
 of,


I
 think
 a
 majority
 of
 over
 in
 the


context
 of
 Google,
 it's
 almost
 like
 a


four
 or
 five
 billion
 dollar
 stake.
 Um,


well,


Anthropic
 is
 deciding
 to
 go
 with
 Google


for
 cloud
 computing
 over
 AWS.
 What
 is
 my


take
 on
 this?
 I
 think
 two
 things.
 Number


one,
 the
 OpenAI
 browser
 is
 not
 killing


Google.
 So,
 I
 think
 Google
 going
 it
 down


to
 244
 today
 was
 a
 gift
 for
 shareholders


and
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 stupid.
 Makes


sense
 that
 Google
 recovered.
 Number
 two,


I
 think
 AWS
 is
 a
 massive
 business
 based


on
 what
 we
 saw
 with
 the
 AWS
 outage


yesterday.
 That
 was
 crazy.
 76
 million


websites
 run
 on
 AWS
 and
 I
 think
 the
 moat


for
 AWS
 had
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 crowd
 strike


moment
 back
 in
 July
 of
 2024.
 When


something
 goes
 down,
 everyone
 realizes


how
 unbelievably
 important
 it
 is
 today,


which
 is
 part
 of the
 reason
 I
 think


Amazon
 was
 actually
 up
 3%.
 However,
 it


is
 not
 bearish
 for
 Amazon
 to
 lose


Anthropic
 or
 to
 not
 get
 as
 much
 money


from
 Anthropic
 because
 I
 think
 for


Anthropic,
 OpenAI,
 Gemini,
 XAI,
 all


these
 foundation
 model
 companies,
 they


are
 trying
 to
 diversify
 the
 cloud


computing
 and
 hyperscaler
 companies
 that


they
 work
 with.
 I
 mean,
 Oracle,
 AMD,


Broadcom,
 Nvidia,
 all
 of
 them
 are


working
 with
 OpenAI.
 A
 ton
 of
 them,
 by


the
 way,
 Mazuo
 came
 out
 today
 and
 said


that
 Broadcom's
 mystery
 client
 that's


going
 to
 be
 paying
 them
 $10
 billion
 in


revenue.
 That
 is
 probably
 anthropic.
 So,


you've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies


diversifying
 the
 cloud
 spend
 that
 they


do.
 Yes,
 that's
 less
 revenue
 going
 to


AWS,
 which
 could
 potentially
 be
 bad
 for


Amazon
 Web
 Services,
 but
 that
 doesn't


mean
 that
 they
 shouldn't
 be
 working
 with


Amazon.
 In
 fact,
 there
 was
 a
 report
 that


came
 out
 yesterday
 that
 said
 Anthropic


has
 paid
 Amazon
 already
 $2.6
 billion
 in


the
 past
 nine
 months
 just
 for
 AWS.
 So,
 I


wouldn't
 say
 it's
 bearish
 AWS.
 It's
 just


more
 bullish
 Google
 because
 now
 some
 of


that
 money
 is
 going
 to
 Google.
 Now,
 the


one
 thing
 about
 AWS
 that
 I
 will
 say
 is


that
 although
 they're
 getting
 a
 ton
 of


business
 from
 Anthropic,
 and
 now
 Google


potentially
 is
 getting
 some
 of
 that


business
 as
 well.
 I
 think
 AWS
 could
 hurt


Amazon
 on
 earnings,
 and
 I
 think
 the


stock
 could
 go
 down
 below
 200
 uh
 if
 AWS


shows
 any
 level
 of
 de
 acceleration
 or


the
 guidance
 isn't
 that
 good
 going
 into


Q4.
 And
 why
 would
 the
 guidance
 not
 be


that
 good
 going
 into
 Q4?
 Well,
 uh
 they


just
 had
 an
 outage.
 Now,
 I
 think
 the


service
 credits
 that
 they
 are
 going
 to


have
 to
 give
 out
 to
 a
 Robin
 Hood
 that


was
 down
 for
 10
 hours
 and
 Coinbase
 was


down
 and
 Snapchat
 was
 down,
 Slack
 was


down,
 etc.
 That
 shouldn't
 be
 that
 big
 of


a
 deal.
 I
 mean,
 that
 should
 be
 kind
 of


like
 maybe
 tens
 of
 millions,
 maybe


hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 of
 an
 expense


for
 Amazon.
 That
 shouldn't
 really
 make
 a


difference
 to
 the
 bottom
 line.
 But
 if


AWS
 doesn't
 accelerate
 or
 if
 there
 is
 no


potential
 hope
 of
 acceleration
 based
 on


this
 earnings
 uh
 and
 the
 rest
 of
 the


business
 around
 commerce
 and
 advertising


and
 all
 that
 stuff
 is
 just
 flat
 or
 like


not
 that
 exciting.
 Yeah,
 I
 can
 see


Amazon
 tanking.
 I
 really
 could.
 We're


going to
 talk
 about
 Netflix
 in
 a
 second.


Netflix
 tank
 because
 they
 couldn't
 beat


their
 estimates.
 Uh
 I
 think
 that
 would


be
 a
 buying
 opportunity.
 Again,
 I'm


buying
 Amazon
 as
 a
 cornerstone
 stock
 of


the
 portfolio.
 I
 really
 don't
 care
 what


happens
 in
 the
 short
 term.
 10
 years
 from


now,
 I
 think
 Amazon
 is
 going to
 be
 much


bigger
 company.
 But
 AWS
 acceleration


will
 help
 the
 stock
 go
 up
 after


earnings.
 If
 we
 see
 any
 level
 of
 just


like
 basicness,
 you
 know,
 Street
 wants


18%
 growth.
 They
 come
 in
 at
 17.9
 or


18.1.
 If
 we
 don't
 get
 a
 real
 beat,
 I


think
 the
 stock
 is
 flat
 or
 it
 sells
 off,


which
 is
 okay
 because
 long
 term,
 I
 think


AWS
 is
 going to
 be
 a
 very,
 very


important
 business
 for
 Amazon
 and
 that's


not
 slowing
 down
 anytime
 soon.
 It
 just


not
 it
 might
 not
 be
 accelerating
 to
 the


level
 of
 a
 GCP
 or
 Azure.
 Now,
 the


question
 then
 becomes,
 well,
 do
 I
 sell


Amazon
 and
 get
 Microsoft
 and
 Google?


Sure.
 It's
 just
 that's
 discounting


everything
 else
 that
 is
 important
 when


it
 comes
 to
 understanding
 Amazon.
 It's


also
 discounting
 the
 fact
 that
 Amazon
 is


red
 year
 to
 date.
 Google
 and
 Microsoft


are
 up
 a
 lot.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 riskreward


might
 be
 better
 on
 Amazon.
 But
 then


again,
 these
 are
 max
 seven
 companies


where
 whichever
 one
 you
 buy
 over
 the


next
 10
 years,
 theoretically
 all
 of
 them


should
 do
 really
 well.
 Uh
 however,
 that


is
 something
 to
 watch
 out
 for
 going
 into


earnings.
 AWS
 needs
 to
 grow.
 We
 know
 how


important
 AWS
 is
 based
 on
 the
 outage


yesterday
 that
 shut
 down
 half
 the


country,
 at least
 in
 the
 United
 States,


in
 regards
 to
 the
 internet.
 That
 simply


didn't
 work
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 these


companies.
 and
 websites,
 but
 any
 de


acceleration,
 the
 stock
 could
 get
 hit


going
 into
 earnings.
 All right,
 Netflix


earnings,
 let's
 get
 into
 that.
 Uh,
 look,


Netflix
 didn't
 have
 the
 best
 earnings,


and
 it's
 kind
 of
 weird
 how
 these


earnings
 turned
 out.
 If
 you
 were
 live
 on


the
 market
 close,
 you
 saw
 the
 reaction


to
 earnings.
 Uh,
 down
 7%
 after
 hours.


Kind
 of
 feels
 like
 it's
 isolated
 to


Netflix,
 but


it's
 not
 the
 best.
 So,
 they
 missed
 on


EPS
 by
 16%.
 And
 the
 question
 becomes
 why


did
 Netflix
 miss
 as
 badly?
 By
 the
 way,


Capital
 One,
 Intuitive
 Surgical,
 a
 lot


of
 other
 companies
 had
 a
 great
 earnings.


Chub
 Limited
 Insurance
 Company,
 that
 was


good.
 Texas
 Instruments
 missed
 EPS
 by


1%,
 beat
 revenue
 by
 2%.
 But
 Netflix
 is


kind
 of
 the
 main
 story
 right
 here.
 So


587
 versus
 697,
 that's
 what
 the
 street


expected.
 That's
 why
 you
 have
 that


massive
 move
 down
 as
 soon
 as
 the
 numbers


came
 out.
 11.5
 billion
 on
 revenue.
 That


came
 in
 line
 with
 the
 streets


expectations.
 Now,
 what
 did
 Netflix
 give


as
 the
 reason
 for
 why
 they
 had
 a
 crappy


quarter?
 Well,
 operating
 margin
 was
 28%


below
 the
 guidance
 of
 31.5%.
 That's
 not


good
 because
 that
 hurts
 EPS.
 Uh,
 and


that's
 why
 you
 saw
 that
 EPS
 miss.
 And


then
 the
 reason
 for
 this
 is
 because
 they


had
 an
 ongoing
 dispute
 with
 Brazilian


tax
 authorities
 that
 was
 not
 in
 their


forecast.
 So,
 Netflix
 is
 blaming
 the


Brazilians


and
 that's
 why
 the
 stock
 is
 down.
 Uh,


operating
 margins
 for
 2025
 came
 in
 line


with
 expectations
 for
 Q4.
 So
 for
 the


fiscal
 year
 it
 was
 okay.
 For
 Q4
 uh
 it
 is


2%
 above
 year-over-year
 what
 is


expected.
 It
 is
 down
 5%
 for
 the
 quarter


quarteron
 quarter.
 That
 tends
 to
 be
 what


happens
 to
 Netflix
 in
 Q4.
 But


nonetheless
 it's
 not
 like
 a
 massive


reaceleration
 in
 operating
 margins
 going


into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 My
 take
 on


this
 I
 mean
 look
 Netflix
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 phenomenal
 company.
 Uh
 if
 you're


a
 long-term
 shareholder
 you
 probably


don't
 care
 that
 much
 because
 Netflix


over
 the
 next
 10
 years
 will
 be
 a
 bigger


company
 than
 it
 is
 today.
 the
 the
 the


broader
 issue
 with
 Netflix,
 I
 think,


right
 now,
 is
 this
 idea
 that,
 hey,
 um,


look,
 stocks
 up
 40%
 here
 to
 date.
 You've


got
 tons
 and
 tons
 of,
 you
 know,
 we're


talking
 about
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 of


subscribers
 that
 are
 on
 the
 platform.


How
 does
 Netflix
 grow?
 And
 ironically,


one
 of the
 stories
 we
 talked
 about
 in


the
 market
 open
 this
 morning
 and
 why


WBD,
 Warner
 Brothers
 Discovery,
 was
 up


10%
 of
 the
 day.
 There
 are
 rumors,
 as
 per


Bloomberg,
 that
 Comcast
 or
 Netflix
 is


thinking
 of
 buying
 Warner
 Brothers.
 And


you've
 got
 some
 really
 important
 media


properties
 there
 like
 HBO
 Max
 that
 a
 lot


of
 people
 already
 pay
 for
 separately


including
 myself
 even
 though
 I
 barely


watch
 it
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 I
 pay
 for


it.
 Uh
 but
 HBO
 Max
 could
 be
 integrated


into
 Netflix.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 EPS
 miss


based
 on
 Brazilian
 tax
 authorities
 the


street
 will
 forgive
 it.
 Not
 that
 big
 of


a
 deal.
 Stocks
 up
 30%
 year-to
 date
 or


40%
 year
 to
 date
 now
 35%.


And
 overall
 it
 has
 been
 proven
 to
 be


recession
 proof.
 However,
 if
 we
 do
 have


a
 recession,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 people
 are


going
 to
 be
 that
 quick
 to
 not
 cancel


their
 Netflix
 or
 other
 streaming


subscription
 service
 providers
 because


maybe
 the
 content
 is
 just
 not
 that
 good


enough
 and
 people
 say,
 "I
 don't
 care."


And
 the
 other
 problem
 is
 the
 Elon
 Musk


backlash
 around
 sensitive
 content
 for


kids
 that
 has
 been
 on
 Netflix.
 I
 think


the
 sort
 of
 like
 cancel
 your
 Netflix
 um


movement
 started
 in
 October.
 So,
 I
 don't


think
 that
 had
 an
 impact
 on
 Q3.


Potentially
 will
 have
 an
 impact
 on
 Q4.


Uh,
 but
 if
 it
 happened
 towards
 the
 end


of
 September
 and
 Elon
 Musk,
 who
 has
 250


million
 followers,
 got
 people
 to


unsubscribe,
 that's
 not
 the
 best
 thing


for
 Netflix
 either.
 So,
 look,
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day,
 I
 don't
 think
 this
 was
 a


quarter
 that
 people
 should
 be
 upset


about.
 I
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 indicative


of
 big
 tech
 in
 general
 missing
 on
 their


earnings.
 If
 big
 tech
 does
 miss
 on
 their


earnings,
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 pretty.


But
 Netflix
 did
 seems
 like
 it
 was


isolated
 because
 of
 Brazilian
 tax


authorities.
 Overall,
 I
 don't
 think


there's
 going to
 be
 any
 broader
 issues


with
 Netflix.
 I
 will
 say
 though,
 just
 as


a
 content
 creator,
 I'd
 rather
 buy
 Google


over
 Netflix.
 I
 mean,
 if
 Netflix
 does


acquire
 Warner
 Brothers
 Discovery,
 that


would
 be
 a
 30
 to40
 billion
 dollar


acquisition
 just
 to
 get
 content
 onto
 the


platform.
 Google
 has
 creators
 that


connect
 with
 audiences,
 and
 as
 a
 result,


Google
 doesn't
 really
 need
 to
 pay
 for


the
 content.
 Google
 just
 creates
 the


platforms
 that
 allows
 people
 to
 produce


the
 content.
 So,
 I
 think
 both
 are


phenomenal
 companies.
 I
 would
 not
 want


to
 be
 paying
 the
 multiples
 that
 Netflix


is
 trading
 at
 right
 now
 that
 are
 more


expensive
 than
 Nvidia.
 I
 would
 rather


just
 buy
 Google,
 but
 long
 term,
 I
 think


this
 is
 a
 nothing
 burger
 for
 Netflix.


It's
 just
 one
 of
 those
 quarters
 where


they
 had
 a
 Brazilian
 tax
 issue
 and


that's
 why
 they
 missed
 on
 earnings.
 All


right,
 last
 thing
 we're
 going
 to
 talk


about
 today
 is
 what
 is
 going
 on
 with


gold.
 Gold
 took
 a
 pretty
 ugly
 hit
 on
 the


day,
 down
 about
 1.3%.


And
 I
 mean,
 look,
 or
 sorry,
 not
 down


1.3%.


Down
 a
 little bit
 more
 than
 that.
 Down


about
 5%
 on
 the
 day.
 So,
 here's
 the


question
 to
 everyone
 in
 the
 chat.
 Uh,


this
 was
 the
 worst
 day
 for
 gold
 since


April
 2013.
 Lost
 $1.75
 trillion
 in


market
 cap.
 Is
 gold
 a
 bubble?
 I
 hesitate


to
 say
 it's
 a
 bubble.
 I
 think
 it
 is


getting
 overcrowded
 and
 I
 think
 some
 of


that
 frothiness
 of
 the
 overcrowdedness


of
 the
 trade
 kind
 of
 left
 today,
 which


is
 probably
 bullish.
 Silver,
 by
 the
 way,


down
 7%.
 So,
 silver
 and
 gold
 both
 took


it
 on
 the
 chin.
 I
 will
 say
 that
 we


looked
 at
 a
 chart
 last
 week
 that
 said


central
 banks
 are
 now
 having
 20%
 of


their
 reserves,
 20%
 of
 all
 central
 banks


globally
 in
 gold.
 Gold
 is
 being
 treated


like
 US
 treasuries.
 And
 because
 the


dollar
 is
 going
 down,
 you
 know,
 you


might
 be
 saying
 people
 are
 using
 gold
 as


a
 hedge.
 Now
 again,
 the
 10ear
 going
 down


is
 weird
 because
 that
 means
 people
 are


not
 anticipating
 inflation.
 Gold
 going


up
 at
 the
 same
 time
 is
 again
 weird


because
 people
 are
 anticipating


inflation.
 So
 why
 is
 that
 happening?
 One


argument
 you
 can
 make
 is
 that


geopolitically
 the
 reason
 gold
 took
 a


hit
 today
 is
 because
 there
 is
 a
 bit
 more


peace
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 with
 the
 Israel


Hamas
 deal.
 There
 might
 be
 some
 peace


around
 Russia
 Ukraine.
 And
 if
 that


geopolitical
 instability
 starts
 turning


into
 stability,
 which
 really
 over
 the


past
 two
 years
 we
 haven't
 had
 that
 much


stability
 and
 that
 could
 also
 explain


the
 massive
 70%
 move
 that
 gold
 has
 had


this
 year.
 If
 that
 starts
 to
 become
 more


stable,
 it
 might
 not
 be
 that
 bad
 for


gold
 or
 it
 might
 not
 be
 that
 good
 for


gold,
 which
 ends
 up
 becoming
 more
 ugly,


you
 know,
 to
 the
 downside
 in
 terms
 of


price
 action.
 The
 other
 narrative
 here


is
 retail
 euphoria.
 I
 don't
 know.
 And
 I


think
 I
 asked
 this
 question
 on
 a
 daily


recap
 on
 Wednesday
 last
 week.
 How
 many


people
 are
 in
 gold?
 And
 you
 know,
 I


think
 5%
 of
 you
 in
 the
 comments
 said


you're
 in
 gold,
 but
 the
 majority
 of
 us


are
 not
 in
 gold.
 Ironically,
 Bitcoin
 was


up
 2%
 today.
 So,
 maybe
 there
 was
 a


rotation
 out
 of
 physical
 gold
 to
 digital


gold.
 So,
 my
 take
 here
 is
 that
 I
 would


not
 touch
 this
 trade
 because
 I
 think
 the


risk
 of
 being
 wrong
 and
 entering
 into
 a


very
 crowded
 trade
 that
 is
 now
 going
 to


have
 the
 bottom
 potentially
 fall
 out,


which
 doesn't
 mean
 gold
 has
 to
 go
 down


30%.
 But
 if
 gold
 goes
 down
 another
 5%,


you're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that


are
 like,
 h,
 why
 am
 I
 in
 this
 in
 the


first
 place
 and
 you
 might
 have
 more


sensitive
 price
 pricing
 action
 in
 terms


of
 the
 selling.
 But
 if
 central
 banks
 buy


the
 dip
 on
 gold,
 which
 is
 possible
 if


they're
 thinking
 of
 gold
 is
 better
 than


the
 dollar,
 then
 maybe
 gold's
 going
 back


to
 5,000.
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 hard
 to


make
 the
 prediction
 right
 here
 unless


you
 have
 a
 sophisticated
 understanding


of
 commodities.
 Silver
 going
 down
 7%


today
 also
 wasn't
 the
 best.
 Um,
 but


because
 I
 don't
 have
 that
 really


sophisticated
 view
 of
 commodities,
 and


because
 I'm
 not
 willing
 to
 take
 a
 chance


on
 something
 that's
 up
 70%
 year
 to
 date,


that
 never
 goes
 up
 70%
 year
 to
 date.


Like
 that
 doesn't
 happen
 for
 gold.
 I'm


not
 willing
 to
 jump
 in
 at
 these
 levels.


Ironically,
 I
 would
 I
 I
 would
 actually


rather
 buy
 Bitcoin.
 You
 know,
 I
 feel


like
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 hedge


against
 currency
 debasement.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 Bitcoin
 only
 moving
 up
 15
 20%


this
 year
 versus
 gold.
 Maybe
 it
 be
 ends


up
 becoming
 a
 better
 opportunity.
 But
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 the
 move
 in
 gold


can't
 be
 understated.
 losing
 a
 5%
 rally


or
 or
 losing
 a
 5%
 um
 uh
 move
 on
 today's


price
 action
 after
 a
 65%
 rally
 makes
 you


wonder
 just
 like
 the
 high
 momentum


stocks
 we
 talked
 about
 at
 the
 beginning


of
 the
 show
 is
 it
 structural
 or
 is
 it
 a


breather
 I
 think
 we
 need
 some
 more
 data


to
 see
 but
 if
 it
 is
 structural
 then
 you


might
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 money
 exiting


into
 the
 asset
 class
 and
 then
 the


question
 becomes
 where
 does
 that
 money


go
 money
 market
 funds
 S&P
 500
 Nvidia


Google
 that
 is
 the
 broader
 question
 But


it
 does
 seem
 like
 some
 of
 that
 momentum


is
 getting
 hit.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 over
 the


next
 couple
 weeks,
 the
 question
 is,
 can


gold
 regain
 the
 footing?
 Is
 this
 a
 buy


the
 dip?
 Do
 central
 banks
 come
 in?
 Does


retail
 come
 in
 to
 buy
 the
 dip
 or
 is
 this


one
 of
 those
 things
 where
 look,
 it
 had
 a


good
 run
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 chill
 out,


consolidate
 for
 a
 bit?
 Maybe
 it
 goes


sideways.
 It
 doesn't
 have
 to
 tank
 20%.


But
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 go
 back
 up
 20%.


And
 that
 wouldn't
 be
 the
 worst
 thing
 in


the
 world
 for
 gold.
 All right,
 that's
 it


for
 me.
 Thank
 everybody
 for
 listening


and
 watching.
 deeply
 appreciate
 everyone


who
 tunes
 into
 these
 daily
 recaps
 and
 um


big
 big
 thank
 you
 to
 everyone
 who


subscribed
 to
 the
 Substack.
 Uh
 I'll
 put


the
 link
 in
 the
 description.
 We
 did
 our


first
 two
 deep
 dives,
 Dualingo
 and
 BMR.


Uh
 I
 have
 kind
 of
 fallen
 in
 love,
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 lie,
 with
 the
 art
 of


written
 word.
 I
 never
 thought
 I
 would


really
 get
 into
 writing,
 but
 I
 think


after
 four
 years
 of
 talking,
 I
 needed
 a


new
 challenge
 for
 a
 medium
 to
 express
 my


thoughts
 and
 ideas.
 And
 uh
 I
 really
 am


grateful
 that
 people
 are
 finding
 value


in
 the
 in
 the
 content.
 I've
 already


started
 working
 on
 the
 next
 two
 deep


dives.
 The
 grab
 one,
 you
 know,
 I've


already
 did
 a
 grab
 thesis,
 but
 I'll


refine
 it
 for
 Substack.
 That'll
 probably


be
 out
 on
 Friday.
 The
 other
 one
 might
 be


out
 on
 Friday
 as
 well.
 Depends
 on
 how


fast
 I
 can
 finish
 it.
 But
 I've
 already


started
 the
 extra
 two
 deep
 dives
 because


I
 just
 I'm
 excited
 for
 this
 stuff,
 dude.


It's
 kind
 of
 fun
 to
 put
 all
 the
 research


together
 into
 one
 thing
 and
 then
 put
 it


out
 into
 the
 world.
 And
 Substack
 is
 a


pretty
 cool
 platform
 to
 do
 it
 on.
