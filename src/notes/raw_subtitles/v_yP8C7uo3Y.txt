- Sometimes, you find that just rethinking

you've known about for ages
but never really interrogated
makes a huge difference.
(intriguing grandiose music)
Everyone's image of that
is in some way based on modern movies.
In some ways, I think those
were rather impressive,
but they got some things terribly wrong.
(intriguing grandiose music)
I think the main function of the triumph
is for Romans to think about
what it is to be Roman,
but it has another side to it,
which is, it puts fear into the enemy.
(intriguing grandiose music)
There are Romans whose
image and whose achievements
for good or bad are so written up
that we think of them
as people without whom
the world would not now be like it is.
(intriguing grandiose music)
I think there are all kinds of emphases
that translators come in
and help us see some of the
difficulties in a new way.
You cannot translate "The Odyssey"
without interpreting "The Odyssey,"
and without, in some way,
having a modern conversation with it.
I'm Mary Beard,
and I've worked on the
Ancient Romans for 50 years,
and I've written quite a
lot of books about them.
I've just started a new podcast
called "Instant Classics,"
which is about Greece and Rome.

(air whooshing)
It's hard to picture ancient Rome now,
because we see it inevitably
through film and through television
where it's very grand, it's very white,
its architecture is white,
its art is white, and
its people are white.
One thing we know about Ancient Rome
is that it was a multicultural,
cosmopolitan society.
You only have to read a
bit of Roman literature
to discover that the
city is a home to people
from everywhere in the western
world and from Africa too.
We tend to picture ancient Romans
as being a bit like rather
formal Brits from the 1950s;
shaking hands and being a bit pompous.
I'm sure some of them were,
but I remember being very surprised
when I discovered that the
normal form of greeting
between two Roman men
was to kiss each other,
not to clasp a hand.
And in fact, on one occasion
in the 1st century CE,
the emperor had to ban the practice
because there was a very nasty bout
of infectious herpes going around,
and he wanted to stop it.
There's a lot of myths
that you need to bust
about the gladiatorial games,
particularly in the center
of Rome in the Colosseum.
I think everyone's image of that
is in some way based on modern
movies on "Gladiator I,"
"Gladiator II."
In some ways, I think those
were rather impressive,
but they got some things terribly wrong.
And I think the thing that, for me,
the biggest mistake they made
is to imagine how the audience behaved.
We do tend to think that
somehow the audience
must have gone wild,
they were there because
they wanted blood lust,
they were erupting in passion, in anger,
saying "Kill him," or
"Save him," or whatever.
Everything that we can
tell about the audience
from Roman sources themselves
suggests that actually it
was much more controlled
than anything you see are in the movies.
For start, it was
completely sex-segregated,
the women sat separately from the men.
But more than that, everybody
came dressed quite posh,
you had to wear a toga to go.
Now a toga is the official
Roman dress for Roman men,
but it's worn when you are
doing something official,
you don't wear it to the
local bar in the evening.
To go to the gladiatorial games,
that was kind of official,
and you had to wear your toga.
Everybody sat not just segregated by sex,
but they sat in rank order.
Senators by law, the top
rank of Roman society,
on the front rows,
and then the next rank
down just above them,
until you got to the very back
where you found the slaves and the women.
Now I think that we somehow
have to just overturn our sense
that it was kind of mad,
"losing control" going on.
I think it was probably more
like an evening at the opera
than an evening at a football match.
If you want to see the Romans going wild,
you know, in very, very large numbers,
then what you should be doing
is thinking about the chariot racing,
not the gladiatorial combat.
Now in Rome, the biggest, most famous,
most elaborate stadium for chariot racing
was the so-called Circus
Maximus, the biggest circus.
Now that held probably,
we have to estimate this,
we can't be certain,
it held something like quarter
of a million people, 250,000.
Now, compare that to the Colosseum,
Colosseum's relatively small
at 50,000 maximum capacity.
Now if you go to 250,000,
there isn't a stadium in the
modern world that is that big.
The biggest football stadium
is something like pushing 150,000,
so it's really vast.
And there, we do get a sense
that it was much less well-behaved,
that, for a start, the crowd was mixed,
women and men seemed to have sat together,
there was loads of betting going on,
we have no evidence at all really
of any betting in the Colosseum,
but you sure bet on the
races in the Circus Maximus.
And it was a place where you
really did let your hair down,
unlike the much more sedate, actually,
atmosphere of the Colosseum.
Now, the trouble is,
the Colosseum survives
and has very much fixed our view
of, you know, the iconic building of Rome.
Sadly, the Circus Maximus,
which was much more lavish originally
that was looted for building
material, et cetera, et cetera.
And I'm afraid if you go to visit it now,
it isn't exactly impressive,
you have to do a lot of
work with the imagination.
But that is where the
real Roman excitement
of sport happened.
Sometimes you find that just rethinking
things about Roman culture that
you've known about for ages
but never really interrogated
makes a huge difference to how
you think about the Romans.
The toga, the official dress
of the Roman male citizen,
is one of those things.
One thing that people have really begun
to see the significance of
is that the toga is vast,
it's a vast piece of cloth
which is wrapped around you
to make it an outer garment.
Now, it is absolutely impossible
to put a toga on yourself,
you need someone to help you.
Well, fine, but I think that
leads on to other conclusions.
It's a reminder at the very least
of the role of service and
servitude in Roman society.
This was a culture in
which you needed slaves
to help you get dressed.
That's what being a slave
society really means.
You can see when you look, for example,
at women's hairdressing,
that something very similar
about the dependence on
slavery comes across,
and the statues that we see
of Roman elite women now
with their elaborate top knots,
they're almost impossible
to imagine recreating them
with just braids and some pins.
And what's clear I think
if you try to do it
is that those are hairstyles
which are literally stitched onto you.
Now that's another case
of where you see the absolute
dependence of the Roman elite
on slavery and slaves,
just doing your hair.
If we want the best insight
we can possibly get into Roman life,
then we go to Pompeii
and Herculaneum towns
destroyed by the eruption
of Vesuvius in 79 CE.
Now, I think we have to be a
bit careful about imagining,
as people often claim that
Pompeii and Herculaneum
are towns that were
somehow frozen in time.
They weren't frozen in time,
the population of both cities
had quite a lot of notice
that something nasty was going to happen,
they packed up a bit, and,
people, they just escaped.
All the same,
there are some vignettes
you get from those towns
that are just irrecoverable elsewhere.
My favorite I think
is relatively recently
discovered workshop,
well, it's a house really which
is undergoing redecoration.
And the foolish or the
over-optimistic painters
were obviously still working there
on the morning of the eruption.
You can see their little pots,
you can see how they've
organized their buckets,
you can see how the
scaffolding was working.
You can imagine that at a
certain point they ran for it,
and I'm afraid, I don't think
if they'd left it that long,
they were going to get out alive.
You can find all kinds of
insights into real Roman life
outside Italy.
And one of the best places recently
for producing kind of new look
at how the ancient world worked
is the site of Vindolanda,
It's an army base near Hadrian's
Wall in northern Britain.
And there, not only have
you got the archeology,
but you've also got,
because of the conditions of
the site which is preserved,
basically letters and documents
that were originally
written on wax on wood.
And there, you see everything
from the quartermaster,
the guy who's in charge of the stores,
trying to work out and keep records
of what they've got in the store rooms.
You see a list of sick notes really
of all the soldiers who are off,
because they've got very
nasty eye infections,
and so, weren't allowed
out on active service.
But you also see the social
life that went on on the base.
One of the most famous
and touching documents
that has been discovered there
is a birthday party invitation
where the wife of the commandant
is writing to another woman
who's based on another
army base, not far away,
saying, "Do come to my birthday."
It may have on it the
earliest signature of a woman
from the Roman world
that we have bit debated,
but I think that's probably true.
Sometimes, apparently
insignificant tiny discoveries
really change your view about
life in the Roman world.
And because of the wet conditions,
'cause it has always been
wet in northern Britain,
because of the wet conditions,
a lot of shoes have been discovered,
Roman leather shoes on army bases.
And one thing that is
completely eyeopening
is that many of those
shoes are children's shoes,
there's quite a few women's shoes
alongside the shoes of the soldiers.
Now, that has kickstarted a whole new way
of thinking about a Roman army base,
thinking about soldiers having families,
thinking about it being a mixed community,
not just, you know, a bunch of squaddies
and no women inside.
There's absolutely no way
that ancient Roman women
were privileged,
none of them had the vote for a start.
In many ways, Roman women
had a much better deal
than almost any other
women in the ancient world.
If you go to fifth century BCE Athens,
you find women are pretty
enclosed, really no rights,
they don't mix socially
if they're members of the elite
with the men of their family.
Now, go to Rome,
and women probably have
more rights than any time
up to the 19th century in Europe.
They can inherit property,
they can go to court,
and they have a great privilege
of having dinner with their men folk.
We've inherited a very
minimalist white version
of both Greece and Rome.
The statues that survive
have mostly survived
without any decoration,
without any paint on them.
And so, our picture is very much something
white, shiny marble.
And, in fact, we've known this
for more than a hundred years.
It's totally now recognized
that Greek and Roman statues
were regularly painted.
Now I think there is a bit of a debate
about how garishly they were painted.
We can get traces of some of the pigments
that we can now pick up from the statues.
But quite how lurid the colors were,
I think it's still a bit up for grabs.
I think whatever though,
just to start to put that sort of color
back into the picture,
to imagine that when you were a rich Roman
commissioning a statue of your wife
or your father or whatever,
you wouldn't have been commissioning
this very kind of austere,
pure white marble object,
you'd be commissioning something
that was full of color that
you were injecting life into,
that you were seeing the red of their lips
and the pupils in their eyes.
And there is something much more immediate
about the Romans and the Greeks
when you see them in that context.
You know, they're there
with images of people
that are radiant.
Now, I think, for some of us,
that radiance is a bit over the top.
I'm sure there are some people
who probably would prefer
the shiny white marble
to the very lurid reds and blues
that are sometimes suggested,
but you've gotta get your head
around color of some sort.
Greek and Roman culture
were deeply intertwined,
and you can't actually pull them apart.
I think one aspect of that
is that elite Romans looked at Greece
and saw literary traditions,
artistic traditions,
that they wanted to reuse
and borrow and adapt.
There is no doubt that
there's a strong influence
from Greece to Rome.
You have to be a bit careful though
of just seeing ancient Roman culture
as if it was a kind of secondary culture,
you know, that just took
hand-me-downs from the Greek world.
Rome is always adapting Greek culture,
it's using it in a different way.
And, of course, Roman
culture goes the other way.
And when Greece is a
province of the Roman empire,
it is inheriting and
adapting cultural forms
from the Roman world.
So it's very much a two-way traffic.
One of the things that the
Greeks borrowed from Rome,
we might not like this very much,
was indeed gladiatorial
displays and wild beast hunts.
Now, there's been a bit of a tendency
to say the Greeks were far too
pure for that kind of thing,
that, you know, their minds
were always on philosophy and theater
and, you know, high culture.
But what they did was they,
and we can see the traces of this,
they adapted their theaters
to host wild beast hunts
and gladiatorial displays.
You can see where they put bars
around the theatrical space
to keep the audience safe from the animals
that were being horribly
slaughtered there.
For me, Greece and Rome are
always part of the same world,
they're always talking to each other.
And one sign of that
is of course that there were
Greek settlements in Italy
from very early on, from
the 7th century BCE.
And, in fact, some of the
earliest Greek writing
comes from Italy.
So it's a much more
kind of intricately mixed
up symbiosis mixture
than just, you know, one
culture borrowing from another.
Rome has never gone away
from the western world,
and every generation, I think,
and we're going back centuries here,
every generation has rediscovered it
in a slightly different way,
and they always,
they always think they're being very novel
when they rediscover it.
But I think that's partly because,
or very largely because,
Rome has given us an image
of what it is to be powerful,
what it is to be larger than
life, what it is to be funny,
what it is to be an empire.
And so, it's provided many
of the building blocks
that we need in order to
think about ourselves.
A good example of that
is all those dynast and princes and kings
in the 16th and 17th century
who had themselves sculpted
or represented in paint
in the guise of roman emperors.
Now, to us, that looks
actually a bit silly, we think,
didn't they think that
they looked a bit silly
wearing as modern people,
those little Roman military skirts?
But I think what we ought to be seeing
is that what Rome was doing
was providing a way of thinking about
what it was to be powerful.
And it does that from
different perspectives
on the political spectrum.
We have a tendency to think that Rome
provides a model
for the right-wing,
and when we think of fascist
dictator Mussolini in Italy,
who famously saw himself very much
in the model of Julius
Caesar and Augustus,
the Emperor Augustus.
And we shouldn't forget
that Karl Marx said
that the French revolution,
you know, took place in Roman dress.
There are revolutionary aspects to Rome,
there are dictatorial aspects to Rome,
and they're there terribly present for us,
waiting for us to come
and reinterpret them,
and make them our own.
And Rome has survived
because every generation
has made it their own.

A Roman triumph or a triumphal procession
was awarded to a super
successful Roman general.
It's not clear whether there
were any exact rules for this.
Some ancient writers said,
"Oh, you had to have
killed 5,000 of the enemy
to be awarded a triumph."
We don't know if that's entirely true.
What it was was a vast procession
through the streets of Rome
leading up to the Temple of
Jupiter Best and Greatest
on the Capitoline Hill,
with the general, the successful general,
standing in a very elaborate
ceremonial chariot,
dressed up in an
extraordinary purple outfit
with a purple cloak and silver stars,
which apparently mimicked
the statue of Jupiter,
the God himself, on the Capitoline Hill.
He processed through the
city, up to the temple
to make a sacrifice to Jupiter
in honor really of his victory.
But it wasn't just that.
In front of the general's chariot,
you find the captives that he'd taken
in the course of the war,
and the spoils of victory.
Those captives, we have
some descriptions of them,
and they seem to be most impressive
when they're of the highest rank
and the most exotically dressed.
And what a general really wants
is to have a king walking
before his chariot,
a king in his regal outfit,
but shackled and captured
by the power of Rome.
Some of them we can
see from the sculptures
that we have depicting this procession,
some of them seem to have
been actually carried
in this procession, not walking.
Some certainly did walk,
but some were kind of put onto platforms,
and bound hand and foot,
were carried along for people to look at.
And we know that the
audience of the triumph
were drawn to see what
the people were like
the Romans had now conquered.
Now it could sometimes rebound,
they sometimes felt very
sorry for them actually.
But the general is
really parading his power
over the dynasts and the ordinary soldiers
that he had conquered.
There was the booty,
some of the best bits
of loot that he'd taken
in the course of his campaign.
We often think of the spoils of victory
in a rather limited way actually.
We think of sculptures,
precious works of art,
coin coming into Rome
and being on display to the
people in the procession,
and there were certainly plenty of those.
But it goes much further than that.
And what they were wanting to do was to,
as it were, kind of exemplify
what the conquered territory was.
Triumphs differed hugely
in scale and spectacle.
Gradually, it seems they
got more and more lavish
as Roman conquest reached into places
that were really rich,
and in Roman terms, really exotic.
And I think that what you
have to see the triumph as,
in part,
is literally something
that brings the Roman audience,
who might have never been
outside a radius of 30 miles
of the city of Rome or
certainly not Italy,
it brings them face to face
with the kind of stuff and creatures
that they had never ever seen.
I mean, they've not got picture books
of what it looks like when you go abroad.
There are some representations
of the foreign places you
find in painting, a mosaic,
that's true,
but this is literally
bringing the Roman people
face to face with the world,
and I think it's likely
uneasily from our point of view,
the world that they
believe they've conquered.
So you could find animals on display,
you could find plants, trees on display.
In one triumph of 71 CE
by the Emperor Vespasian
and his son, Titus,
they had balsam trees brought from Judea.
So what you are seeing
is not just the elaborate brica-brac,
and sometimes it is very elaborate,
this extraordinary stories
of, you know, seeing the king's throne
encrusted with jewels
carried along in precession,
but it's also the flora and
fauna of the captured place.
And that combines
sometimes in a strange way
with boasts on the part of the general,
so that you get placards
carried along with that,
which list the places that
the general conquered,
the individual town,
placards which depict
the victories happening,
the destroyed thoughts of the enemy.
And behind the general
came at least some of
his victorious troops.
They interestingly were
said to have sang lewd songs
slightly at the expense of the general,
so he didn't get above himself.
And just in case he
should get above himself,
there he is dressed as
Jupiter Optimus Maximus,
you don't want him to think
that he really is a god.
It said that there was a
slave in the chariot with him
saying, "Remember you're a man,
remember you're a man,
remember you're a man"
the whole time.
But they go through the city like that.
It's now I think very hard
to get a sense of the size
and the excitement of it.
We know they put up special stands,
so people could get a good view.
I suppose I tend to
think of this as a Brit
as something like what you
might see in the coronation
of a British monarch.
But I think the coronation
of a British monarch
is a rather feeble comparison.
You know, I think people
were coming to see
what the general had done,
they were coming into the center of Rome
to see what Roman conquest meant.
So it's hugely impressive,
but it's also very, very
ideologically rooted.
I think the main function of the triumph
is for the local Roman audience,
it's for Romans to think
about what it is to be Roman,
but it has another side to it,
which is, it puts fear into the enemy.
It's a ceremony news, of
which I suspect, travels
that enacts the humiliation
of the defeated.
And we know that there are several
defeated monarchs and generals
who kill themselves rather than
be displayed in the triumph.
The most famous of those
I think is Queen Cleopatra
who probably heard all about triumphs
from her lovers Julius
Caesar and Mark Antony.
When Octavian, the
future emperor, Augustus
wants to take her back to parade
as, you know, the key bit of booty
in his triumphal procession,
she is said to have said,
"I will not be triumphed over,"
and that accounts for her suicide.
And I think that you can see
that the eyes of the Roman people
and, you know, the she humiliation
of becoming a piece of spoil
is something that you might
think, and we know some did,
"I am not going to do
that, I am simply not."
You know, Cleopatra is a refusenik,
Mithridates is another refusenik.
It's a ceremony of celebration,
it's also a ceremony of humiliation.
The triumph must have been at its biggest,
it must have been quite extraordinary.
It's hard to imagine that
there was any Roman celebration
that was more, you know,
confident in some ways
of its own spectacle.
And the root of a triumphal procession,
we don't exactly know where it goes,
but it must have been able
to accommodate thousands,
hundreds of thousands.
It is really, really big news.
Whether it's the biggest kind
of procession of its type
in human history, it's impossible to say,
but it certainly provided
the model in Europe
for celebrations of royal
or military power ever after.
Successful generals in a Renaissance
imitating the Roman triumph
to celebrate their own kinds of victory.
So I think in many ways
it provides a model
for what it is like to celebrate conquest.
It's a template for how the
city puts its might on display.
We have a very good idea
of the number of triumphs
that took place,
because Romans recorded it
as accurately as possible
to be fair, not entirely accurately,
because they attribute one triumph
to Romulus, the founder of Rome,
and he probably didn't exist.
So there's some fuzzy edges,
but, basically, they've
got a list of triumphs
and they add up to more than 200.
What is interesting,
there is a real big break
in the kind of triumphal
procession that you get
in the reign of the first
emperor Augustus in 19 BCE,
because after 19,
no one who is not either
the emperor himself
or a prince of the royal house,
no ordinary general receives a triumph.
So up to 19 BC through
the Republic of Rome,
it is for ordinary or rather
the extraordinary generals
to claim their triumph.
Under Augustus, it becomes a royal ritual.
The logic is that all
wars after that point
are fought as if they
were the emperor's wars.
So when a triumph comes,
it is the emperor who gets
the honor of the triumph.
So they become very, very monarchical,
which they hadn't been up to that point.
It's very hard to say
which is their grandest
or the most extravagant,
over the top lavish, or bad
taste of these ceremonies,
but the ceremony that people pick out
and that Romans picked out
was the two-day ceremony
that Pompey the Great held in 61 BCE
for his conquest of the pirates,
and also his conquest of the
Eastern King Mithridates.
Now this starts out by
being extraordinary,
because triumphs by and
large are one day affairs.
You know, you load everything up,
you process through the city of Rome,
you get to the Temple of
Jupiter, Optimus Maximus,
you do a sacrifice, and
you have a great dinner,
and that's it.
Now what Pompey does,
he says that he cannot
squash all his stuff
into a procession that lasts just one day,
so it's a two-day procession.
It is full of really, really
extravagant spoils,
particularly from the
court of Mithridates.
Actually one of these
we have one bronze pot,
which almost certainly goes
back to Pompey's triumph
and still survives.
It's in the Capitoline Museums at Rome,
and it's clearly came
from Mithridates' kingdom,
and it's very, very likely
was one of the things
that was actually carried
in the procession.
It is not by any means the grandest,
it's a rather elegant plain bronze picture
about 70-centimeters high.
But we read of most fantastic
ornamented sundials,
we read kind of barrels load of coin,
we read even of an image of Pompey himself
presumably made out of the spoils,
where his head carried in this procession
as part of the fruits of conquest.
His head is made entirely out of pearl,
it must have been a
colossal head made of pearl.
It has to be said that
this is one of the cases
where in a sense Pompey
got it a bit wrong.
I mean people are always
looking at the triumph,
both wanting to admire it, be impressed,
but also wanting to say,
"I think this is a bit over the top,
I think this is a bit vulgar actually,
I think this is too luxurious."
So there's always that counterpoint.
And the head of Pompey in pearl
was one of the objects
that really captured
that critical tendency,
'cause people said two things about it,
they said this is a very
effeminizing thing to do.
Pearls in the Roman imagination
were very, very much
associated with women.
So the critics of Pompey said
"How could he have his head
represented in that female material?"
But there were also, I'm afraid,
rather nastier insinuations made later
because Pompey, in the end,
he's the major adversary of Julius Caesar,
Julius Caesar and Pompey
fight it out in the 40s BC
basically for who's going
to run the Roman world.
Caesar wins, Pompey flees to Egypt.
When he gets to Egypt,
he thinks he's getting out of
the boat to safety, actually,
but the Egyptians on the
shore cut his head off,
and people looked back at this head,
that is just the head of Pompey
carried in the procession,
and they wagged their fingers and said,
"Hmm.
That was an omen of what
was going to happen to him
in the end."
So there is always this
saying that huge luxury,
and Romans are very moralizing about this,
huge luxury is always a bit dangerous.
The moment of the general's,
the acme of his career,
you know, the triumph
is kind of thing you'd say
what little Roman boys dream of
as being the biggest success
they could ever achieve:
a triumphal procession.
And yet, it's very often slightly tainted
with potential disaster,
potential overreach.
Any number of stories of, for
example, triumphing generals
who very soon after found
that their sons died.
Now kind of the success of the triumph
comes back to haunt you.
There was always a question
of how far you really were
as the triumphing general,
the star of the show,
and it was obviously extremely desirable
if you are a general
to have a great king in front of you,
marching along in front of you
to show that you had conquered a king,
there was uncomfortably often a sense
that the crowd were
actually more interested
in the king and the princesses
and the sad captains,
than they were in the general himself.
So, it's not all win
if you have a triumph.
There is a wonderful quote
from the Roman philosopher, Seneca,
who was also the tutor
of the Emperor Nero,
I'm thinking in part about
triumphs, and it says,
"Petty sacrilege gets punished.
Sacrilege on a grand scale,
that is what gets you a triumph."
It's a quote which Seneca is
partly drawing and adapting
from a famous story
about Alexander the Great
who captures a pirate and asks a pirate,
this is in the 4th century BC,
he says to the pirate,
"Why did you take other
people's property, what?
Why did you steal things?"
And the pirate replies,
"If you steal things and
you've only got one ship,
you're called a pirate.
If you steal things
and you've got a whole army and a navy,
you are called a king," right?
Seneca, in a way, is adapting that,
and having one eye on the triumph.
And I think it's quite I very much like,
because it shows the
Romans really reflecting
on reward, morality, on who
makes it big, who doesn't,
who gets blamed,
and we do have, or much
of the modern world
I think has a tendency,
to think of Romans as if they had,
you know, no problem about any of this,
they went off and they conquered things,
and they came back with
their booty and their loot,
and they didn't bat an eyelid,
they thought it was holy to their good,
they had no morals group.
What Seneca's saying is that,
you know, if you rip things off,
you go to temple and you
take all the sacred objects
from the temple,
and you're just a single guy,
you'll find yourself punished.
If you do that on a grand
scale, Rome honors you.
And the question, of course, is
that he's raising about Roman imperialism
and the Roman Empire is it
actually different, you know?
Is it just theft on a very big scale?
Now it's those kind of worries I think
that the Romans are negotiating
when they talk about triumph.
(air whooshing)

(air whooshing)
There are a handful of Romans
who we now perceive to
have changed the world.
I think it's very hard
to go back and to say
whether that's true or not,
but there are Romans whose
image and whose achievements
for good or bad are so written up
and so much part of the way
history seems to have developed
that we think of them as people
without whom the world
would not now be like it is.
Now I think some of them are much murkier
than we'd like to think,
and we know much less
about them than we imagine,
but still, they occupy a place
in how Western history thinks
of itself having developed.
I think what we ought to do
is explore some of these
really consequential Romans
and ask a bit about why they have been
so impactful on European history.
And the one I would start
with is the Emperor Augustus,
the first Roman emperor.
There is a bit of debate
about whether Julius Caesar or Augustus
should count as the first Roman emperor,
but the first person
to call himself Emperor
was the adopted great
nephew of Julius Caesar,
born Octavian, who
eventually changes his name
when he takes sole power
to become Augustus.
His career is very long.
After the assassination of
Julius Caesar in 44 BCE,
when Octavian is still very young,
he intervenes, raising an army himself,
to fight on the side of those
who want to avenge the
assassination of Caesar.
There's a long civil
war that follows that.
What turns out is that Octavian
is the last man standing.
He finally beats Mark Antony,
another of Caesar's great defenders.
And in 31 BCE, as it were,
left after more than
a decade of civil war,
left as the person who is
defacto ruling the Roman world.
What is then extraordinary
is how he moves from being actually
a particularly unpleasant
young thug in those civil wars,
really violent, vicious,
competent in civil war,
he transforms himself,
and at the same time
transforms the Roman world,
he transforms himself into
the elder statesman emperor.
Gives up the name Octavian,
he takes the name Augustus instead.
Doesn't mean anything really.
If it means anything, I
suppose, it's revered one,
and he establishes a
system of one-man rule
which lasts for centuries.
He actually manages to craft a way
that Rome could operate
with one man at the helm,
as against the republican tradition
of power sharing and
quasi sort of democracy.
And I think that what is
absolutely extraordinary
is that, A, we don't know
how quite he did this.
We have very few contemporary
observing sources
to tell us what happened during his reign.
It lasts until 14 CEs, longest
reigning Roman emperor.
But during that period,
whatever the opposition was,
he manages to construct
a kind of set of political relationships,
which still includes the old elite,
it still includes the Senate,
but now focused around the
emperor as an individual.
And that doesn't change.
You know, for the rest of Roman history,
that is how Rome is governed,
and it provides a template
for any number of monarchs
and dictators ever after.
It's a mystery,
and I think why it is so
intriguing and enticing
is we can't quite see how he did it.
We don't know if at the
end of the civil wars,
he had a master plan,
or as I suspect he's improvising on the go
to try to work out a system
of power that people will,
even if they don't like, go along with,
and it worked.
I'm not a great admirer
of Roman imperial power,
but you do have to hand it to Augustus
that he established a
centuries lasting system
of one-man rule.
Extraordinary.
I think as my number two,
I'm going to have a fellow
traveler of Augustus,
and I'm going to have
the Roman poet Virgil,
for the simple reason
that Virgil in writing
his great epic of the foundation of Rome,
Aeneas fleeing as a Trojan
from the burning city of Troy
to found the beginnings of
the Roman race in Italy.
He provided, for all time,
a way of understanding what
empire was and its paradoxes.
It's not a jingoistic poem,
it's a rather careful and thoughtful poem.
It's a poem I think
than which no other poem
has ever been so successful.
It's a fair bet, I couldn't prove it,
but it's a fair bet that
since Virgil died in 19 BCE,
every day, somebody somewhere
has been reading this poem, the "Aeneid,"
and it captures both the
ambition of the Roman Empire
to be an empire without end,
but it also captures the
doubts, the problems,
and the costs of what come with empire.
In the final scene of the poem,
you see the hero, Aeneas,
kill somebody who has
surrendered to him in a war crime
that was a war crime even in Ancient Rome
And the final scene says,
"Look at the cost of empire."
It has been utterly
influential ever after,
and probably almost as influential,
very close second, to Augustus himself.
(air whooshing)
I think my third spot is
going to go to Julius Caesar.
I say that slightly reluctantly,
because Julius Caesar was
very much a flash in the pan.
He has a fairly ordinary
career when he starts out,
he becomes clearly more and more concerned
to become a single
populist leader at Rome,
to dispense with the
trappings of democracy
and to establish himself
as a one-man ruler.
He sort of does, that's true,
he does it by techniques that
are still in the playbook
of populist politicians,
he speaks directly to the people,
he bypasses the institutions of the state,
you know, he uses the ancient
equivalent of social media
to communicate with the Roman people.
And he does transcend the
conventions and the norms
of Roman sort of democracy.
The problem is, and why he
only comes in in third place
is it's a flash in the pan.
He's only there for five years,
and most of the time, he's off
out of Rome somewhere else.
He doesn't just establish anything,
he shakes everything up,
but he doesn't put structures in place.
I think for number four,
we're going to go to Cincinnatus,
who is, I have to confess, not entirely,
but very largely a mythical character.
But his myth is so strong
that I think he counts for me
as one of these really influential people.
What we can tell about him
is that he was a fairly,
well, a very conservative
politician in Rome
in the 5th century BCE
towards the beginning of the republic.
He is very much an opponent
of the rights of the Roman people,
very much, you know, a
conservative patrician,
he has some pretty rocky encounters
with reforming plebeian politicians.
But what is key about Cincinnatus
is that he's counsel for a short time,
after he's been consul,
the chief officer of the Roman state,
he goes to his farm and
he, as it were, says,
you know, "I've done my bit,
I'm now going to do the farm.
I'm going to become an
ordinary person again.
A few years later when
Rome is really suffering
in a, you know, tense military standoff,
Roman people come to him, the
Roman authorities come to him,
and they say, "Could you
please come and save Rome?
We need your expertise."
What he does is he goes
back, he takes charge,
he saves Rome against the enemy,
but then he goes straight
back to his farm.
And I think what is so important
about Cincinnatus is that,
you know, his name is still reflected
in Cincinnati after all,
what is important is that
he did not break through
the conventions of the republic.
He showed that you could serve the state
without taking it over.
And so he became a huge
hero and a role model
for those who wanted to lead
without being an autocrat.
So I think he nudges
himself in there for me.
(air whooshing)
For number five, I'm going
to have the brothers Gracchi,
Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus
in the second half of the 2nd century BCE.
Amazingly charismatic characters,
which are sometimes put down,
their charisma is sometimes put down
to the influence of their mother Cornelia,
who groomed them to be politicians.
Why I've chosen them is,
well, for two reasons.
They represent the first
time we see clearly
a leading Roman politician
explicitly and in a thought-out way
taking the side of the
non-elite versus the elite.
Now, they come from an elite background,
but both of them stand
up in different ways
for the rights of the
poor and the dispossessed.
Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC
sees the terrible economic distress
of the peasant class in Rome,
and initiates a land
redistribution program.
Gaius Gracchus, his
brother, a decade later,
reinitiates that because it gets stalled.
But Gaius Gracchus is the
first person in Roman history
that we can see has not
just some good ideas,
but he has some good ideas
that fit together into a program.
He has land distribution,
he has the distribution
of subsidized grain
to the Roman people,
he has anti-corruption laws,
he has changes in taxation.
He seems to me to be the first person
who kind of has joined
up politics in Rome.
Now, I'm afraid both of them
come to sad ends. (chuckles)
Tiberius and Gaius are
both basically subject
to judicial murder by
conservative senators,
and they're killed on the job in a way.
But they become forever
after this beacon of people
who could reformulate
how politics should be.
And in Tiberius' case,
I think, in some ways,
he's not as radical as Gaius,
but he explicitly says,
"The prophets of the Roman Empire
should go to the Roman people,
not just to the elite."
That's a crucial, crucial step forward.
Number six is the Roman
politician, Marcus Tullius Cicero.
And I've chosen him
because he is the absolute
summing up of what it is
to see oratory, persuasion,
and speaking as the
foundation of democracy.
Cicero is not a military man,
he has a bit of military experience,
but he's pretty lousy at it.
He is a new man in Roman politics,
he doesn't have a whole
set of elite ancestors,
he's not poor,
but he's not part of the
established political class,
and he speaks his way to the top.
He sees that persuading
your fellow citizens
is about that is where
power consists in him.
He gets office very early in Rome,
he unmasks what looks like
a terrorist conspiracy
against the Roman state
from within the conspiracy of Catiline,
he actually rather brutally puts it down,
but his words have never
ever been forgotten.
Like so many Romans have a sad end,
he is in the civil war between
the heirs of Julius Caesar
and the assassins of Julius
Caesar in that civil war,
he's assassinated basically.
But he made it clear and
continues to make it clear
that you can persuade
people to act differently.
You can still see Latin
quotes from Cicero on placards
in today's political demonstrations.
That's how important he is.
(air whooshing)
I've chosen as number
seven, the Emperor Nero,
not because I'm a particular fan of Nero,
and in fact it's now very hard to know
how you cast judgment on Nero.
The sources about Nero are so hostile,
and yet we also know
that he had popularity
during his lifetime,
and after his death,
there were false Neros,
people claiming to be Nero,
bubbled up in the East saying,
"Look, I didn't die.
Here I am, I'm Nero."
That suggests a degree of popularity.
But I think that,
in a way of reformulating
what it was to be emperor,
he showed that there were different ways
of demonstrating your power.
These have almost always
got really rubbished
by his opponents,
and we are the inheritors
of that rubbishing.
Now we still talk, we still have cartoons,
you know, of modern political leaders
doing what Nero is supposed to have done,
fiddling and singing while Rome burns,
it's still part of our
own political rhetoric,
but what is clear is that
Nero put art and culture
right at the heart
of what it was to be a Roman emperor,
and in some ways the example of Nero
was always bubbling under the surface
of Roman political power ever since.
He has become the but of criticism,
not just fiddling while Rome burned,
but also his sense of apparent vanity.
He was a great actor,
and he would perform in theaters,
and he would lock the theater doors,
so that people couldn't get out
while he was still performing,
so that, you know,
some women were supposed to
have had babies in the theater
while they were waiting
for the emperor to finish.
But I think there is a sense there
that saying power doesn't
just rest in the sword,
doesn't just rest in speechmaking,
power is also represented
in art, in culture,
in theater, in the softer arts.
I mean, Nero is about
soft power, if you like,
if we see him in a generous way.
(air whooshing)
My last choice is the
historian Cornelius Tacitus,
active in the late 1st
and early 2nd century CE.
Now actually Tacitus,
in real-life, have to say,
was a bit of a collaborator
with Roman imperial power.
He flourished as he himself admits
under a particularly
obnoxious emperor demission,
but that's not why I'm choosing him.
I'm choosing him because his account
of the dynasty of the Julio-Claudian,
the emperors that followed
Augustus in the 1st century CE,
his account of that dynasty is in my view
the most searing account
of one-man rule ever.
He hones in on exposing
how corruption works
and on exposing the way
that people collude with imperial power,
the way the empire in the sense,
not of the geographical empire,
but the empire in the
sense of one-man rule,
pollutes the Roman state.
When people read his Latin,
they find him very hard to read,
actually, the language
is extremely difficult.
People can often find that very
frustrating and irritating,
but that language has a point.
What Tacitus is saying
is that "I cannot describe
how one-man rule works
except in language that is
itself corrupted," right?
One-man rule corrupts what you say.
Now, in some ways,
I think Tacitus' modern
heir is George Orwell
who sees that the corruption of language
and the corruption of speech
goes along with corruption in power.
You might notice,
and I certainly noticed when
I was compiling the list,
that there were no women on it.
Look, I'm a feminist, and
I had been heart-searching,
but I thought I could have found a woman,
I could have found, for example,
the emperor Augustus's wife, Livia,
and I could have put her in there,
and in some ways, it
would've made me feel better
not to have an all-bloke lineup.
I don't think that would've
been the right thing to do.
I think that there were women
of immense talent in Rome,
of course, there were.
There were women who had influence
and who exercised power
in all kinds of ways,
of course, there were.
I think the problem is
that they are lost to us.
We can reinvent them, but
it is literally reinvention.
I think that to some extent,
you have to face up to the maleness
of the official Roman world,
I hope that I have faced up to it,
and also to see
there must have been
different perspectives here,
but they are almost entirely lost to us.
Instead, what we get,
when Roman writers think
about powerful women,
they do think of people
like Augustus's wife, Livia,
but their power is always for the bad.
Now, what is the role of
Livia in that early dynasty?
Well, it's the role that she had
in Robert Graves' "I, Claudius,"
she's the poisoner, the schemer,
she's the person that you can blame
for why things went wrong.
I mean, women's power
is perceived in the ancient
world as being corrosive,
whether that's Cleopatra
who is seducing and somehow emasculating
upstanding young Romans like Mark Antony,
or the women of the imperial court
who are scheming behind the scenes
to bring about either
their own erotic desires,
"Who am I going to sleep with next?",
women are notoriously sexual
beings for Roman historians,
but also trying to influence
who actually gets on the throne.
Now, the trouble is, that
might have been the case,
we can't know.
But we do know that women are always
very convenient people to blame
for when men mess things up.
The history of Western
misogyny is very adept
at finding women to blame
for when things go wrong,
and I think it more or less
started in the Roman Empire.
I think the question of
how you judge these people
is very tricky.
People often write in to me and say,
"I don't like the way that you
do sometimes make judgments
about X as a mass murderer,
when they're 2000 years in the past.
Surely, it's often said,
"You should be judging
them on their own terms,
not on your terms."
I've got two responses to that.
One is, quite often, these people were
hostilely judged
in antiquity itself,
but we rather brush that under the carpet.
Julius Caesar, for example,
it's reckoned now that
he may well have killed
about a million Gauls in
his campaign against Gaul,
and there were people in Rome
who said he was committing
crimes against humanity.
This is not a new invention
that Caesar was a war criminal,
there were people in Rome who said that.
So I think we have to
be very careful always
to listen out for the discordant
voices in antiquity itself.
But I think perhaps more important
is that the job of the historian,
and this kind of explains I think
why we sometimes find
there's a flip flop here
between one sort of judgment
of Alexander the Great
and another, you know,
favorable or not favorable,
same with Caesar, whatever,
is that the job of the historian I think
is to have stereoscopic vision.
I think it is important to
understand these characters
in their own context,
and in their own terms,
and how people, by the
standards of their time,
yes, I think you should do that.
But I think that the modern historian
can't just leave their own moral values,
you know, at the library door.
I do at a certain point have to say
I find the conquests
of Alexander the Great,
very, very uncomfortable,
and I think what I particularly dislike
in terms of our modern
appropriation of them
is the way we somehow seem to go along
with approving of what they did.
I might not want to disapprove of it,
I might want to say, in part,
that by the standards of
their own time was okay,
but I do have to say it's
not the standards of ours,
and we have to realize
that there are moral issues and questions
about what happened in antiquity
that we shouldn't be afraid
of bringing to the surface.
I'm very happy to do that.
I mean, I think it's quite interesting,
I've chosen a group of men
for my most influential Rome,
I think I had no choice but to do that.
I can also say,
but I think there is
something about the misogyny
of the Roman Empire that I deplore.
And you have to be able
to hold those two views
at the same time, I think.
(air whooshing)
(page rustling)
(air whooshing)
I first touched base with "The Odyssey"
when I was I suppose about seven or eight,
but it wasn't with "The
Odyssey" as a whole,
it was with the stories
that we were told at school,
and that my mum told me that
were drawn from "The Odyssey,"
now, how Odysseus challenged
the one-eyed cannibal giant, the Cyclops,
how he managed to get
past the alluring Sirens,
et cetera, et cetera.
I learned the stories of
tales from "The Odyssey."
I didn't read "The Odyssey" in any detail
until I was in my mid to late teens,
both at high school and at university.
And I think what was surprising to me
was that "The Odyssey"
isn't just a story of tales
of daring-do, which is
what I thought it was,
it's a hugely complicated story
about, you know, one
man's attempt to get home
about questions of what it is to be a man,
and questions looking not at
Odysseus the hero himself,
but looking at his son Telemachus
of what it is to grow up.
What really gripped me I
think then about "The Odyssey"
was its complexity.
The fact that it starts right
in the middle of things,
we don't see Odysseus for a bit,
he's supposed to be the hero,
we zoom down on Ithaca
and we find his family.
Eventually, when we do hear these stories,
they are told by Odysseus
to somebody else,
we don't see them as it were firsthand.
It is the most complicated postmodern epic
you could ever imagine,
and I never realized that
until I read it cover to cover.
How ancient listeners
or readers, you know,
understood and received "The Odyssey"
is a really puzzling
and intriguing question.
We think we know,
I mean almost nothing is really
certain about "The Odyssey,"
but we think we know
that the poem in its now 24 books
originated in a bardic culture.
It started life as a series
of partly interlocking,
partly formulaic tales sung by bards,
let's say around a campfire or
after dinner in the evening.
It's slightly different
each time it was performed
as people put different bits
in, as the audience would say,
"Oh, let's have the
Cyclops tonight," you know?
We've got this very fluid
kind of oral reception
and oral production first,
you know, whatever date we
think that is, you know,
anytime from the 10th century BC onward.
I think it is very, very
hard for us to understand
the sophistication of oral audiences.
You know, I suspect we'd rather
minimize the sophistication.
I think that if we were more of an oral
rather than a written culture,
we would see the ways that
oral points and oral emphases
can hit home in a way that
we probably would miss.
The likelihood is that
"The Odyssey" reached
some kind of written form
after generations of body composition,
perhaps in the eighth century BCE first,
whether or not it had
anything to do with someone
who was or was not called Homer,
we haven't a clue.
But it didn't just stop there,
I think that it's clear that "The Odyssey"
is being tidied up and altered
right up to the 5th century BC.
I think at that point,
we still have an oral
aspect to "The Odyssey."
I suspect there are still people
listening to "The Odyssey"
in the 2nd century CE,
but there are also very learned
readers and commentators
who are doing with "The
Odyssey" much that we do,
which is reading it
really carefully at heart.
It does look,
and I think this is the
conclusion of ancient readers
and modern readers,
it does look as if there is at some point,
there is a kind of overarching author,
or series of authors,
who are pulling it into shape,
and I think they're reading
it as sophisticatedly
as we do.
They're looking for signs
of what kind of culture,
what sort of historical
culture lies behind this.
The kind of questions that
we ask about "The Odyssey"
do go back a very long way.
So I think there are huge differences
in terms of our ability
to concentrate orally,
which I'm sure that the
first listeners had,
but I think we also
have much more in common
with readers of "The Odyssey,"
in, you know, 3rd century Alexandria,
they were doing much what we are doing:
reading it with great attention.
I am really excited by the
Christopher Nolan film.
"The Odyssey" has not had
much luck with filmmakers,
I have to say.
I'm hoping that finally
someone will give us an Odyssey
that we can really get into.
And I hope that it will encourage
a lot of people actually
to discover or rediscover "The Odyssey,"
if they haven't done so already.
It's one of the reasons
that on our new podcast,
"Instant Classics,"
we've got a book club
where we will be reading "The
Odyssey" over about a year
to really talk it through book by book.
I think that one has to
reckon that people will find
different Odysseys as they always have.
It helps a huge amount
if you see what the text is
from which this movie is going to come.
There's so much in that to talk about
that I think it will help really inform
a kind of a criticism or an
appreciation of the Nolan film,
if people have already got into it.
I'm very much looking forward
to a great best seller list moment
for "The Odyssey," actually,
in the next year or so.
As for translations,
I think it's a bad idea
to be too prescriptive.
If somebody picks up from
a secondhand bookshop
or off the web a
translation of "The Odyssey"
that they get into, that's fine.
I think the really important thing
is that you have an English text
that most of them are pretty reliable.
You have an English text which
will take you along with it.
In recent times,
there've been two
translations of "The Odyssey,"
which I think if people were just saying
"Which one should I read," I
would suggest they went to,
one is Emily Wilson's translation
of "The Odyssey" a few years ago,
which is amazingly the first
translation of "The Odyssey"
by a woman into English.
There's also an even more
recent one by Daniel Mendelsohn,
which came out earlier this year,
which is also I think excellent.
They have some kind of translator issues,
I think with each other,
but they are very good up to the minute,
very readable translations.
That said, you know,
translations are absolutely
always interpretation.
You cannot translate "The Odyssey"
without interpreting "The Odyssey"
and without, in some way,
having a modern conversation with it.
You know, why 19th century translations
often do sound stilted
is 'cause they were talking
to 19th century people
about "The Odyssey,"
they're not talking to us.
I think there are all kinds of emphases
that translators come in
and help us see some of the
difficulties in a new way.
And what was very clear
in the Wilson translation
was that when she was
talking about the slaves
in the household of
Penelope, Odysseus' wife,
and his son, Telemachus, in Ithaca,
she translated slaves as slaves.
Now you go back to most of
the standard translations
from the 1950s or before,
and they always use, or almost always use,
that euphemism "serving girl," right?
They actually obscure the
slavery in this culture.
Wilson said, she wanted
to look at this head on.
And, you know, when she
saw an enslaved person,
she was going to call
that person enslaved.
And, of course, it does change your view
of the kind of society that
we see in "The Odyssey,"
it's perfectly legitimate.
In some ways,
you could say that both translations
are technically legitimate,
but what Wilson's does is say,
"Look a bit more carefully
at what the status
of these people are."
I think that every new translation
is always adding something, opening up,
yeah, okay, maybe it's
concealing things too,
but it's opening up
different ways of seeing it,
it's also in the case of "The Odyssey."
it's inevitably grappling with words
that we don't quite know how to translate.
Very early in the first couple
of lines of "The Odyssey,"
Odysseus, he's being talked about,
the poet is calling to the Muse
to tell the story of this man,
the man we don't yet know,
but the man is a Odysseus.
And the Greek adjective that
goes with man is polytropos,
and it literally means
much turning, turny abouty,
"Tell me about a much-turning man?"
For centuries,
in fact, back to Latin
translations of "The Odyssey,"
in the 3rd century BC,
people have been wondering
what the text meant?
What does polytropos mean?
Does it mean wily?
Does it mean bashed around on his voyage?
Is he kind of having a terrible, difficult
circuitous route home?
Is he a bit not trustworthy?
Is he clever?
And I think that quite often it's possible
and the notes on a good
translation will help you
when the translator explains,
"Hey, look, I had trouble deciding
what adjective to use here,
and these were the choices I had,
and these were the reasons
that I made my mind up
this way or that way."
So I think there's something...
I think translations are best
when you kind of get messy with them,
and you interrogate them a bit,
and don't take them as Gospel,
but take them as interpretive
experiments on the text.
