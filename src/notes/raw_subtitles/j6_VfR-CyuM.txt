Let's
 get
 started.
 You
 know,
 we
 wanted


to
 try
 something
 new
 this
 week.


Every
 week,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 I
 get
 a
 little


upset.
 Things
 perturb
 me,
 Saxs,
 and,
 uh,


when
 it
 does,
 I
 just
 yell
 and
 scream,


"Disgat."
 And
 so,
 I
 bought
 the
 domain


name.com
 for
 no
 reason
 other
 than
 my
 own


amusement.
 But,
 you
 know what?
 I
 I'm
 not


alone
 in
 my
 absolute
 disgust
 at
 what's


going
 on
 in
 the
 world.
 So
 this
 week


we're
 going
 to
 bring
 out
 a
 new
 feature


here
 on
 the
 Allin
 podcast.
 Disgraciad


corner.


>> He
 was
 the
 best
 guy
 around.
 What
 about


the
 people
 he
 murdered?
 What
 murder?


>> You
 can
 act
 like
 a
 man.


>> He's
 just
 kiding.
 You
 insulted
 him
 a


little
 bit.


>> Snacks
 and
 I
 want
 the
 snacks.


>> What's
 wrong
 with
 you?


>> Your
 hair
 was
 in
 the
 toilet
 water.


Disgusting.
 I
 got
 to
 suffocate
 you,
 you


little.
 It's
 a
 disgrace.


>> Disgraciad.


>> Disgraciad.


>> This
 is
 fantastic.


>> This
 is
 our
 new
 feature.
 Chimath,
 you


look
 like
 you're
 ready
 to
 go.
 Why
 don't


you
 tell
 you
 tell
 everybody
 who
 gets


your
 discretion
 this
 week?


>> Wait,
 we
 all
 had
 to
 come
 with
 a


discretion.


>> You
 really
 You
 missed
 a
 memo.
 All right,


fine.
 Enough.


>> I
 got
 one.
 I
 got
 one.


>> Okay.
 All right.
 Just
 calm
 down.
 My


discretziad
 corner
 goes
 to
 Jason


Calcanis.
 Oh,


>> here
 we
 go.
 Come
 on,
 man.
 You
 can't


>> and
 Pete
 Buddha
 Judge
 where
 they
 in
 the


first
 30
 seconds
 of
 the
 interview


compared
 virtue
 signaling
 points
 about


how
 each
 one
 worked
 at
 various
 moments


at
 Amnesty
 International.


>> Absolutely.


>> Literally
 affecting
 zero
 change,
 making


no
 progress
 in
 the
 world,
 but
 collecting


a
 badge
 that
 they
 used
 to
 hold
 over


other
 people.
 We


>> wrote
 a
 lot
 of
 letters.
 We
 wrote
 a
 lot


of
 letters,


>> which
 is
 good.
 That
 means
 it's
 like
 a


good
 one
 cuz
 behind
 the
 scenes
 Jason
 and


Pete
 Buddha
 Judge
 Disgraciad.


>> Great.
 I'm
 glad
 that
 I
 get
 the
 first
 one


and
 you
 you
 can
 imagine
 what's
 coming


next
 week
 for
 you.


>> I
 saw
 the
 Sydney
 Sweeney
 dress
 today


trending
 on
 social.


It's
 too
 much.


>> What?


>> It's
 too
 much.


>> What
 is
 it?
 I
 didn't
 I
 didn't
 even
 know


what
 this
 is.


>> You
 didn't
 see
 it.
 Nick
 picture.
 Okay.


>> Bring
 it
 up.


>> It's
 a
 little
 floppy.


>> How
 is
 this
 disgusting?
 What
 are
 you


talking
 about
 much?
 It's
 disgraceful.
 A


little
 bit
 of
 like
 look
 at
 this.
 Oh
 my


god.
 Too
 much
 elegant.


>> Too
 much.
 Uh
 in
 my
 day,
 Sachs,
 a
 little


uh
 cleavage
 maybe
 perhaps
 in
 the
 90s
 or


2000s.
 Some
 side
 view.
 This
 is
 too
 much.


>> Very
 high
 brow
 subject,
 madam.


We


>> were
 discussing
 our
 own
 politics
 and
 the


Sydney
 Swedish
 press.


I
 don't
 know
 who's
 trending
 on.


>> Hi
 dad.
 Hi
 dad.
 Put
 away
 the
 phone.


[Music]


>> Let
 your
 winners
 ride.


[Music]


>> We
 open
 sourced
 it
 to
 the
 fans
 and


they've
 just
 gone
 crazy
 with


>> what's
 going
 on
 with
 the
 algorithm.
 I'm


getting
 Sydney
 Sweeny's
 dress
 all
 day.


And
 last
 week
 Sax


>> Well,
 maybe
 you
 should
 stop
 favoring
 it.


>> 15
 times.
 And
 then
 Sax,
 poor
 Sachs
 got


he
 got
 invited
 to
 SluckCon
 for
 two
 weeks


straight
 on
 the
 algorithm.


>> No,
 I
 say
 the
 algorithm
 has
 become
 if


you
 if
 you
 demonstrate


>> Sax
 will
 even
 tell
 if
 that's
 a
 joke
 or
 a


real
 thing.


>> It's
 a
 real
 thing
 in
 San
 Francisco.


>> It's
 all
 too
 real.
 It's
 actually
 real.


Yeah,


>> for
 real.


>> But
 I've
 noticed
 Yeah.
 If
 you
 if
 you


demonstrate
 interest
 in
 anything
 on
 X


now,
 if
 you
 click
 on
 it,
 god
 forbid
 you


like
 something,


>> man,
 the
 algorithm
 is
 on
 it,
 it
 will


give
 you
 more
 of
 that.
 It
 will
 give
 you


a
 lot
 more.


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 So,
 we
 we
 did
 have
 an
 issue.


Um


we
 still
 have
 somewhat
 of
 an
 issue
 where


um


there
 was
 there
 was
 an
 important
 bug


that
 was
 figured
 out
 that
 that
 was


solved
 over
 the
 weekend
 which
 caused
 um


in
 network
 posts
 to
 be
 uh
 not
 shown.
 Uh


so
 you
 basically
 if
 you
 followed
 someone


you
 wouldn't
 see
 them
 wouldn't
 see
 their


posts.


>> Got
 it.


>> It's
 obviously
 a
 big
 bug
 major
 bug.
 Um


then
 um


the
 uh
 the
 algorithm
 was
 not
 probably


taking
 into
 account
 um
 if
 you
 just
 uh


dwelt
 on
 something.


>> Um


>> uh
 but
 but
 but
 if
 you
 if
 you
 interacted


with
 it,
 it
 would
 it
 would
 go
 hog
 wild.


So
 if
 you
 as
 David
 said,
 if
 you
 if
 you


were
 to
 favorite,
 reply
 or
 engage
 with


it
 in
 some
 way,


>> it
 it
 is
 going
 to
 get
 you
 a
 torrent
 of


that
 same
 thing.


>> Oh,
 sachs.
 So
 maybe
 you


>> What
 was
 your
 interaction?


>> Did
 you
 bookmark
 Slack
 on?
 I
 think
 you


bookmarked
 it.


>> Here's
 what
 I
 thought
 was
 good
 about
 it


though
 is
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


>> if
 you
 happen
 to
 switch
 Sydney
 Sweeny's


boobs.


>> Yeah,
 that
 that
 Okay.
 But
 what
 I
 thought


was
 good
 about
 it
 was
 that
 you
 would
 see


who
 else
 had
 a
 take
 on
 the
 same
 subject


matter


>> and
 that
 actually
 has
 been
 a
 useful
 part


of
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 you
 do
 you
 do
 get
 more
 of
 a
 you
 get


more
 of
 like
 a
 360
 view
 on
 whatever
 it


is
 that
 you
 shown
 interest
 in.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It
 it
 it
 just
 it's
 like
 it


was
 giving
 you
 if
 you
 you
 take
 a
 you'd


have
 like
 it
 was
 just
 going
 too
 far.


Obviously
 it
 was
 overcorrecting.
 uh
 it


had
 too
 much
 gain
 on
 um
 it
 just
 turned


up
 the
 gain
 way
 too
 high
 on
 any


interaction
 would
 would
 you
 would
 then


get
 a
 torrent
 of
 that.
 It's
 like
 it's


like
 oh
 you
 had
 a
 taste
 of
 it.
 We're


going
 to
 give
 you
 three
 helpings.


We're
 going
 to
 force
 you
 with
 we're


going
 to
 give
 you
 the
 food
 funnel


>> and
 and
 that's
 all
 being
 done
 I
 assume


it's
 all
 being
 done
 with
 Grock
 now.
 So


it's
 not
 like
 the
 old


>> hardcoded
 algorithm
 or
 is
 it
 using


Grock?


Well,
 what
 what's
 happening
 is
 that,
 you


know,
 we're
 gradually
 deleting
 the
 uh


legacy
 Twitter
 heristics.
 Now,
 the


problem
 is
 that
 it's
 like
 as
 you
 delete


these
 heristics,
 it
 turns
 out
 the
 one


heristic,
 the
 one
 bug
 was
 covering
 for


the
 other
 bug.
 And
 so,
 when
 you
 delete


one
 side
 of
 the
 bug,
 you
 know,
 it's
 like


that
 that
 meme
 with
 the
 internet
 that


where
 there's
 like
 this
 very
 complicated


machine
 and
 there's
 like
 a
 tiny
 little


wooden
 stick
 that's
 keeping
 it
 going,


which
 was
 I
 guess
 AWS
 East
 or
 whatever


had
 something
 like
 that.
 Um,
 you
 know,


when
 when
 when when
 somebody
 pulled
 out


the
 little
 stick
 that
 what's
 this?


>> I
 think
 it'd
 be
 good
 if
 it


>> half
 of
 Earth.
 You
 know,


>> it
 would
 be
 great
 if
 it
 showed
 like
 one


person
 you
 follow
 and
 then
 like
 it


blended
 the
 old
 style,
 which
 was
 just


reverse
 chronological
 of
 your
 friends,


the
 original
 version
 with
 this
 new


version.
 So,
 you
 get
 like
 a
 little
 bit


of
 both.


>> Well,
 you
 can
 still
 you
 still
 have
 the


everyone
 still
 has
 the
 following
 tab.


Yeah.


>> Now,
 something
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 adding


is
 the
 ability
 to
 have
 a
 curated


following
 tab
 because
 the
 problem
 is


like
 if
 you
 follow
 some
 people
 and


they're
 maybe
 a
 little
 more
 prolific


than
 your,
 you
 know,


>> Robert,


>> you
 know,
 you
 you
 follow
 someone
 and


some
 people
 are
 are
 much
 more,
 you
 know,


say
 a
 lot
 more
 than
 others.
 Um,
 that


that
 makes
 the
 following
 tab
 hard
 to


use.
 Um,
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 add
 a
 um
 an


option
 where
 you
 can
 have
 the
 following


tab
 be
 cured.
 So
 uh
 Grock
 will
 say
 what


are
 the
 most
 interesting
 things
 posted


by
 your
 friends
 and
 then
 we'll
 show
 you


that
 in
 the
 following
 tab.
 It
 will
 also


everything


um
 but
 uh
 but
 I
 think
 having
 that
 option


will
 make
 the
 following
 tab
 much
 more


useful.
 Um
 so
 it'll
 be
 a
 curated
 list
 of


people
 you
 follow
 um
 like
 ideally
 the


most
 interesting
 stuff
 that
 they've
 said


which
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 you
 you
 you
 would


want
 to
 look
 at.
 Um
 and
 then
 uh
 we
 we


we've
 mostly
 fixed
 the
 bug
 which
 would


um
 uh
 give
 you
 way
 too
 much
 of
 something


if
 you
 interacted
 with
 a
 particular


subject
 matter.
 Um
 and
 then
 the
 uh
 the


really
 big
 change
 which
 is
 where
 Grock


literally
 reads
 uh
 everything
 that's


posted
 to
 the
 platform.
 Um


uh
 we're
 actually
 there
 there's
 about


100
 million
 posts
 per
 day.
 So
 it's
 100


million
 pieces
 of
 content
 per
 day.
 Um,


and
 I
 think
 that's
 actually
 just
 maybe


just
 in
 English.
 I
 think
 it
 goes
 beyond


that
 if
 it's
 outside
 of
 English.
 Um,
 so,


uh,
 Grock
 is
 gonna
 we're
 gonna
 start
 off


reading
 the,
 uh,
 reading
 what
 what
 Grock


thinks
 are
 the
 top
 10
 million
 of
 the
 100


million
 and
 and
 we'll
 actually
 read


them,
 uh,
 and
 understand
 them
 and,
 uh,


categorize
 them
 and
 match
 them
 to
 users.


It's
 like
 this
 is
 this
 is
 not
 a
 job


humans
 could
 ever
 do.
 Um
 and
 and
 and


then
 once
 that
 is
 scaling
 reasonably


well,
 we'll
 we'll
 add
 the
 entire
 100


million
 a
 day.
 Um
 so
 it's
 literally


going
 to
 read
 through
 a
 100
 million


things
 and
 and
 and
 and
 show
 you
 the


things
 that
 it
 thinks
 out
 of
 100
 million


uh
 posts
 per
 day,
 what
 are
 the
 most


interesting
 posts
 to
 you?


>> How
 much
 of
 Colossus
 will
 that
 take
 like


>> Yeah,
 that's
 like
 is
 it
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 servers
 like
 to
 do
 that


every
 day?
 Yeah,
 my
 my
 guess
 is
 it's


probably
 on
 the
 order
 of
 50K
 H100,


something
 like
 that.


>> Wow.
 And
 that
 will
 replace
 search.
 So,


you'll
 be
 able
 to
 actually
 search
 on


Twitter
 and
 find
 things
 in
 like
 with
 a


with
 a
 plain
 language.


>> We'll
 have
 semantic
 search
 where
 you
 can


just
 ask
 a
 question
 um
 and
 it
 will
 show


you
 all
 content
 uh
 whether
 that
 is
 text,


pictures
 or
 video
 that
 matches
 your


search
 query
 semantically.


>> How
 um
 how's
 it
 been
 3
 years
 in?
 This
 is


a
 It
 was
 a
 three-year
 anniversary
 like
 a


couple
 years.


>> Is
 this
 three
 years?


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Remember
 it
 was
 Halloween.


>> Yeah.
 Halloween's
 back.


>> Halloween's
 back.
 But
 it
 was
 the
 the


weekend
 you
 took
 over
 was
 Halloween.


>> We
 had
 a
 good
 time.
 Yeah.


>> Wow.


>> Yeah.
 Three
 years.


>> Where
 will
 things
 three
 years
 from
 now?


>> Yeah.
 What
 what's
 the
 takeaway?
 3
 years


later,
 you
 were
 you
 you
 obviously
 don't


regret
 buying
 it.
 It's
 saved
 free


speech.
 That
 was
 good.
 Seemed
 to
 have


turned
 that
 whole
 thing
 around
 and
 that


was
 I
 think
 a
 big
 part
 of
 your
 mission.


But
 then
 you
 added
 it
 to
 XAI
 which
 makes


it
 incredibly
 valuable
 as
 a
 data
 source.


So
 when
 you
 look
 back
 on
 it,
 the
 reason


you
 bought
 it
 to
 stop
 crazy
 woke
 mind


virus
 and
 make
 truth
 exist
 in
 the
 world


again.
 Great.
 Mission
 accomplished.
 Uh


>> and
 now
 it
 has
 this
 great
 future.


>> Yeah,
 we've
 got
 community
 notes.
 You
 can


also
 ask
 Grock
 about
 any
 any
 anything


you
 see
 on
 the
 platform.
 Um
 you
 know


just
 you
 just
 press
 the
 Grock
 icon
 on


any
 X
 post
 and
 we'll
 analyze
 analyze
 it


for
 you.
 Um
 and
 and
 research
 it
 as
 much


as
 you
 want.
 So
 you
 can
 you
 can


basically
 have
 just
 by
 by
 tapping
 the


Gro
 icon
 you
 can
 um
 assess
 the
 um


whether
 that
 that
 post
 is
 the
 truth
 the


whole
 truth
 or
 nothing
 but
 the
 truth
 or


whether
 there's
 something
 supplemental


or
 you
 need
 to
 be
 explained.
 So
 I
 think


it
 I
 think
 it's
 actually
 we
 made
 a
 lot


of
 progress
 towards
 uh
 yeah
 um
 freedom


of
 of
 speech
 um
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 and


people
 being
 able
 to
 tell
 whether


something
 is
 false
 or
 not
 false
 you
 know


propaganda.
 The
 recent
 update
 to
 Grock


is
 actually
 I
 think
 very
 good
 um
 at


piercing
 through
 propaganda.
 Um
 so
 um


and
 then
 we
 we
 we
 used
 that
 latest


version
 of
 Grock
 to
 create
 Groipedia


um
 which
 I
 think
 is
 um
 much
 uh
 more
 it's


it
 it's it's
 not
 just
 I
 think
 more
 um


neutral
 um
 than
 and
 more
 accurate
 than


than
 Wikipedia
 but
 actually
 has
 a
 lot


more
 information
 than
 a
 Wikipedia
 page.


>> Did
 you
 seed
 it
 with
 Wikipedia?
 Actually


take
 a
 step
 back.
 How
 did
 you
 guys
 how


did
 you
 do
 this?


Um
 well
 we
 used
 AI


>> but
 meaning
 like
 totally
 unsupervised


just
 complete
 training
 run
 on
 its
 own


totally
 synthetic
 data
 no
 no
 seated
 set


nothing.


>> Um
 well
 it
 was
 only
 just
 uh
 recently


possible
 for
 us
 to
 do
 this.
 Um
 so
 we've


um
 we
 we
 finished
 training
 on
 a


maximally
 true
 seeking


maximally
 true
 seeking
 a
 a
 version
 of


Grock
 that
 is
 good
 at
 cogent
 analysis.


So
 breaking
 down
 um
 uh
 any
 any
 given


argument
 into
 its
 aimatic
 elements
 um


assessing
 whether
 those
 aims
 are
 um
 not


you
 know
 the
 basic
 test
 for
 coency
 the


axioms
 are
 likely
 to
 be
 true.
 they're


not
 um
 contradictory.
 Uh
 that
 um
 the


conclusion
 naturally
 that
 the
 conclusion


most
 likely
 follows
 from
 those
 axioms.


Um
 so
 so
 we
 just
 trained
 Grock
 on
 a
 lot


of
 critical
 thinking.
 Um
 so
 it
 it
 just


got
 really
 good
 at
 critical
 thinking.


um
 which
 wasite
 quite
 hard
 and
 then
 we


took
 that
 version
 of
 Grock
 and
 said
 okay


cycle
 through
 the
 the
 million
 most
 uh


popular
 uh
 articles
 in
 Wikipedia
 and
 and


add
 modify
 and
 delete.
 So
 um
 that
 means


um
 research
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 internet
 um


whatever
 is
 publicly
 available
 um
 and


correct
 uh
 what
 correct
 the
 Wikipedia


articles
 and
 fix
 mistakes
 um
 but
 also


add
 a
 lot
 more
 context


um
 so
 sometimes
 really
 the
 the
 nature
 of


the
 propaganda
 is
 that
 um
 you
 know
 facts


are
 stated
 that
 that
 are
 technically


true
 but
 are
 not
 repres
 do
 not
 properly


represent
 a
 picture
 of
 the
 individual
 or


This
 is
 critical
 because
 when
 you
 have
 a


bio
 as
 you
 do,
 actually
 we
 all
 do
 on


Wikipedia


over
 time,
 it's
 just
 the
 people
 you


fired
 or
 you
 you
 beat
 in
 business
 or


have
 an
 axe
 to
 grind.
 So
 it
 just
 slowly


becomes
 like
 the
 place
 where
 everybody


you
 know
 kind
 of
 who
 hates
 you
 then
 puts


their
 information.
 And
 I
 looked
 at
 mine.


It
 was
 so
 much
 more
 representative
 and


it
 was
 five
 times
 longer,
 six
 times


longer.
 And
 the
 what
 it
 gave
 weight
 to


uh
 was
 much
 more
 accurate.
 Much
 more


accurate.


>> And
 this
 opportunity
 was
 sitting
 here
 I


think
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 Um
 and
 it's
 just


great
 that
 you
 got
 to
 it
 because


>> they
 they
 don't
 update
 my
 page
 but
 you


know
 I
 don't
 know
 twice
 a
 month
 with
 you


know
 and
 then
 who
 is
 the
 secret
 cobble?


There's
 50
 people
 who
 are
 anonymous
 who


decide
 what's
 gets
 put
 on
 it.
 it
 was
 a


much
 better
 much
 more
 updated
 page
 in


version
 one.


>> Uh
 yes,
 this
 is
 version
 0.1
 as
 we
 put
 it


as
 we
 show
 at
 the
 top.
 So
 um
 I
 do
 think


actually
 by
 the
 time
 we
 get
 to
 version
 1


1.0
 it'll
 be
 10
 times
 better.
 But
 even


at
 this
 early
 stage
 um
 as
 you
 as
 you


just
 mentioned
 it's
 it's
 not
 just
 that


it's
 correcting
 errors
 but
 um
 it
 it
 is


creating
 a
 a
 more
 accurate
 realistic
 and


fleshed
 out
 uh


>> description
 of
 of
 people
 and
 events.


you
 think
 and
 subject
 matters
 like
 you


can
 look
 at
 articles
 on
 on
 physics
 in


grapedia
 that
 they're
 much
 better
 than


Wikipedia
 by
 far.


>> This
 what
 I
 was
 going
 to
 ask
 you
 is
 like


do
 you
 think
 that
 you
 can
 take
 this


corpus
 of
 pages
 now
 and
 get
 Google
 to


deboost
 Wikipedia
 or
 boost
 Graedia


in
 traditional
 search
 because
 a
 lot
 of


people
 still
 find
 this
 and
 they
 believe


that
 it's
 authoritative
 because
 it
 comes


up
 number
 one,


>> right?
 So
 how
 do
 we
 how
 do
 we
 do
 that?


How
 do
 you
 flip
 Google?
 Um
 yeah,
 so
 it


really
 can
 if
 if
 people
 share
 a
 lot
 of


if
 if
 if
 Graopedia
 uh
 is
 used
 elsewhere


like
 if
 people
 cite
 it
 on
 their
 websites


uh
 or
 post
 about
 it
 on
 social
 media
 um


or
 when
 they
 do
 a
 search
 when
 Grapedia


shows
 up
 they
 click
 on
 Grapedia
 it
 will


naturally
 uh
 uh
 you
 know
 rise
 in
 in


Google's
 uh
 you
 know
 rankings.
 Um
 I
 did


I
 did
 send
 I
 did
 text
 Cindar
 because
 you


know
 even
 sort
 of
 a
 day
 after
 launch
 if


you
 typed
 in
 Wikipedia
 Google
 would
 just


say
 did
 you
 mean
 Wikipedia?


>> Wikipedia.
 Yeah.


>> And
 it
 wouldn't
 bring
 up
 at
 all.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 true.


>> So so
 now


>> how's
 the
 how's
 the
 usage
 been?
 Have
 you


seen
 good
 growth
 since
 it
 launched?


>> Uh
 yeah.


>> It
 went
 super
 viral.
 Um
 so


we're
 yeah
 we're
 seeing
 seeing
 it


started
 all
 over
 the
 place.
 Um
 but
 yeah,


it's
 and
 I
 think
 we'll
 see
 it
 used
 more


and
 more
 um
 people
 as
 as
 people
 refer
 to


it
 and
 people
 will
 judge
 for
 themselves


when
 you
 read
 a
 Graedia
 article
 about
 a


subject
 or
 a
 person
 that
 you
 know
 a
 lot


about
 and
 you
 see,
 wow,
 this
 is
 way


better
 than
 than
 Wikipedia.
 It's
 it's


it's
 more
 comprehensive.
 It's
 it's
 way


more
 accurate.
 Um
 it's
 not
 it's
 it's


neutral
 instead
 of
 biased.
 then
 you're


going
 to
 send
 you're
 going
 to
 forward


those
 links
 around
 um
 and
 say
 this
 is


actually
 the
 better
 source
 like
 it's
 it


graphed
 will
 will
 will
 succeed
 I
 think


very
 well
 because
 it
 it
 it
 is


fundamentally
 a
 superior
 product
 to


Wikipedia
 it
 is
 it
 is
 a
 better
 source
 of


information


>> um
 and
 we
 haven't
 even
 added
 images
 and


video
 yet


>> so
 we're


>> yeah
 we're
 going
 to
 add
 a
 lot
 of
 video


um
 So,
 uh,
 using
 Grom
 Imagine
 to
 create


videos.
 Um,


and,
 uh,
 so
 if
 you're
 trying
 to
 explain


something,


um,
 Grock
 imagine
 can
 take
 the
 text
 from


Grapedia
 and
 then
 generate
 a
 video,
 uh,


an
 explanatory
 video.
 So
 if
 you're


trying
 to
 understand
 anything
 from
 how


to
 tie
 a
 bow
 tie
 to
 you
 know
 how
 do


certain
 chemical
 reactions
 work
 or
 you


know
 um
 really
 anything
 um
 dietary


things
 medical
 things
 um
 we
 could
 uh


well
 you
 can
 just
 go
 and
 and
 see
 the


video
 of
 of
 how
 it
 works
 that
 is
 created


by


>> when
 when
 you
 have
 this
 version
 that's


maximally
 truth
 seeeking
 as
 a
 model
 do


you
 think
 that
 there
 needs
 to
 be
 a


better
 eval
 or
 a
 benchmark
 that
 people


can
 point
 to
 that
 shows
 how
 off
 of
 the


truth
 things
 are
 so
 that
 if
 you're
 going


to
 start
 a
 training
 run
 with
 common


crawl
 or
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 use
 Reddit


or
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 use
 is
 it


important
 to
 be
 able
 to
 like
 say
 hey


hold
 on
 a
 second
 this
 eval
 just
 suck


like
 you
 guys
 suck
 on
 this
 eval
 like


it's
 just
 this
 is
 crappy
 data.


Yeah,
 I
 I
 guess
 I'm
 not
 I
 think
 I
 mean


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 eval
 out
 there.
 Um


I've
 complete
 confidence
 that
 croced
 is


going
 to
 succeed.
 Um
 because
 Wikipedia


is
 actually
 not
 a
 very
 good
 product.


>> Yeah.


>> It
 it's
 it's
 it's
 the
 the
 information
 is


sparse


uh
 wrong
 and
 out
 of
 date.
 Um
 and
 if
 you


can
 go
 if
 you
 find
 if
 and
 and
 it
 doesn't


have
 you
 know
 there
 are
 very
 few
 images.


There's
 basically
 no
 video.
 Um
 so
 if
 you


have
 something
 which
 is
 um
 you
 know


accurate
 comprehensive


uh
 has
 videos
 uh
 where
 moreover
 you
 can


ask
 if
 there's
 any
 part
 of
 it
 that


you're
 curious
 about
 you
 can
 just


highlight
 it
 and
 gro
 and
 and
 ask
 Grock


right
 there.
 Um
 like
 if
 you're
 trying
 to


learn
 something
 it's
 just
 great.
 It's


it's
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit


better
 than
 than
 Wikipedia.
 It's
 going


to
 be
 a
 hundred
 times
 better
 than


>> Elon.
 Do
 you
 think
 you'll
 see
 like
 good


uniform
 usage?
 Like
 if
 you
 look
 back
 on


the
 last
 3
 years
 since
 you
 bought


Twitter,


there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 after
 you


bought
 Twitter
 that
 said,
 "I'm
 leaving


Twitter.
 Elon's
 bought
 it.
 I'm
 going
 to


go
 to
 this
 other
 wherever
 the
 hell
 they


went
 and
 there's
 all
 these
 new


and
 there's
 all
 these
 and
 there's
 all


these


creature,
 you
 know."


>> Yeah.
 But
 blue
 sky
 falling
 is
 my


favorite.
 I
 guess
 my
 my
 question
 is
 as


you
 destroy
 the
 woke
 mind
 viral
 kind
 of


um
 control
 of
 the
 system
 and
 as
 you


bring
 truth
 to
 the
 system
 whether
 the


system
 is
 through
 graipedia
 or
 through
 X


do
 people
 like
 just
 look
 for


confirmation
 bias
 and
 they
 actually


don't
 accept
 the
 truth
 like
 what
 do
 you


like
 or
 do
 you
 think
 people
 are
 actually


going
 to
 see
 the
 truth
 and
 change
 and


change?


>> Yeah.


But
 I
 mean,
 is
 that
 like


>> you
 thought
 Sydney
 Sweeny's
 boobs
 were


great?
 Let
 me
 see
 mine.


>> Looking
 good.
 Yeah,
 solid
 solid
 week


there.
 Put
 a
 little
 something
 a
 little


sheer,
 you
 know.


>> I
 think
 we
 just
 got
 flagged
 on
 YouTube


again.


>> Yeah,
 we
 did.
 That
 that
 was
 definitely


going
 to
 give
 us
 a
 censorship
 moment.


>> Grade
 a
 moves.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 but
 but
 like
 like
 but
 but
 do


people
 change
 their
 mind?
 I
 mean,


>> if
 there's
 actually
 I
 should
 take


there's
 no
 such
 thing
 as
 grade
 A
 move.


>> Um


It's
 off
 the
 rails
 already.


>> David,
 you
 were
 trying
 to
 ask
 a
 serious


question.
 Go
 ahead.


>> Well,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 know
 if
 people


change
 their
 mind.
 Like,
 can
 you


actually
 change
 people's
 minds
 by


putting
 the
 truth
 in
 front
 of
 them
 or
 do


people
 just
 take,
 you
 know,
 they
 kind
 of


ignore
 the
 truth
 because
 they're
 they


feel
 like
 they're
 in
 some
 sort
 of
 camp


and
 they're
 like,
 I'm
 on.


>> They
 want
 the
 confirmation
 bias.


>> They
 want
 the
 confirmation
 bias
 and
 they


want
 to
 stay
 in
 a
 camp
 and
 they
 want
 to


be
 tribal
 about
 everything.


Um
 it
 is
 remarkable
 how
 much
 people


believe
 things
 simply
 because
 it
 is


their
 the
 the
 belief
 of
 the
 of
 their


inroup,
 you
 know,
 whatever
 their
 sort
 of


political
 uh
 or
 ideological
 tribe
 is.


Um,
 so,
 um,
 I
 mean
 there's
 some
 some


pretty
 hilarious
 videos
 of,
 you
 know,


um,
 you
 know,
 uh,
 there
 was
 like
 some


guy
 going
 around
 um,
 is
 like
 a
 racist


Nazi
 or
 whatever
 and
 and
 then
 and
 and


then
 and
 he
 was
 like
 trying
 to
 show
 them


the
 videos
 where
 of
 the
 thing
 that
 they


are
 talking
 about
 um,
 where
 he
 is
 in


fact
 uh,
 condemning
 the
 Nazis
 in


strongest
 possible
 terms
 and
 condemning


racism
 in
 the
 strongest
 possible
 terms


and
 they
 literally
 don't
 even
 want
 to


watch
 the


So,
 so
 yeah,
 people
 at
 least
 some
 people


would
 they
 would
 prefer
 um
 they
 will


stick
 to
 whatever
 their
 um
 ideological


views
 are,
 whatever
 the
 sort
 of


political
 tribal
 views
 are.
 Uh
 no
 matter


what.
 Um
 the
 the
 the
 evidence
 could
 be


staring
 them
 in
 the
 face
 and
 and
 they're


just
 going
 to
 be
 a
 flat-earther.
 You


know,
 there's
 there
 is
 no
 evidence
 that


you
 can
 show
 to
 a
 flat
 earther
 to
 con


convince
 them
 the
 world's
 round
 because


everything
 is
 just
 a
 lie.
 Uh
 the
 world


is
 flat
 type
 of
 thing.


>> I
 think
 the
 the
 ability
 to
 hit
 at
 Grock


in
 a
 reply
 and
 ask
 it
 a
 question
 in
 the


thread
 has
 really
 become
 like
 a
 truth


seeking
 missile
 on
 the
 platform.
 So
 when


I
 put
 up
 metrics
 or
 something
 like
 that,


I
 reply
 to
 myself
 and
 I
 say,
 "Echrock,


is
 the
 information
 I
 just
 shared


correct?
 And
 can
 you
 find
 any
 better


information?
 and
 please
 tell
 me
 if
 my


argument
 is
 correct
 or
 if
 I'm
 wrong.
 And


then
 it
 goes
 through
 and
 then
 it
 DMs


Sachs
 and
 then
 Sax
 gets
 in
 my
 replies


and
 tries
 to
 correct
 me.
 No,
 but
 it
 does


actually
 a
 really
 good
 job
 of
 like
 and


that
 combined
 with
 community
 notes.
 Now


you've
 got
 like
 two
 swings
 at
 bat.
 The


community's
 consensus
 view
 and
 then


Grock
 coming
 in.
 I
 think
 it
 would
 be


like
 really
 interesting
 if
 Grock
 on
 like


really
 powerful
 threads
 kind
 of
 did
 like


its
 own
 version
 of
 community
 notes
 and


had
 it
 sitting
 there
 ahead
 of
 time.
 you


know,
 like
 you
 could
 look
 at
 a
 thread


and
 it
 just
 had
 next
 to
 it,
 you
 know,
 or


maybe
 on
 like
 the
 specific
 statistic,


you
 could
 click
 on
 it
 and
 it
 would
 show


you
 like,
 ah,
 here's
 where
 that


statistic's
 from.


>> I
 mean,
 you
 can
 I
 mean,
 pretty
 much


every
 I
 mean,
 essentially
 every
 post
 on


X,
 unless
 it's
 like
 advertising
 or


something,
 um,
 has
 the
 Grock
 symbol
 on


it.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 you
 just
 tap
 that
 symbol
 and
 you're


one
 tap
 away
 from
 a
 Grock
 analysis.


Literally,
 you're
 just
 one
 tap.
 And
 we


don't
 want
 to
 clutter
 the
 interface
 with


where
 providing
 an
 explanation,
 but
 I'm


just
 saying
 if
 you
 go
 on
 X
 right
 now,


it's
 one
 tap
 to
 get
 the
 to
 get
 Grock's


analysis
 and
 Grock
 will
 research
 the
 the


the
 X
 post
 and
 give
 you
 an
 an
 accurate


answer.
 Um,
 and
 you
 can
 even
 ask
 us
 to


do
 further
 research
 and
 further
 due


diligence
 and
 you
 you
 can
 go
 as
 far
 down


the
 rabbit
 as
 you
 want
 as
 you
 want
 to


go.
 But
 I
 I
 do
 think
 like
 this
 is
 um
 you


know
 the
 consistent
 with
 we
 want
 X
 to
 be


the
 the
 best
 source
 of
 truth
 on
 the
 on


the
 planet
 by
 far.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 is
 um


and
 and
 where
 you
 hear
 uh
 you
 know
 any


and
 all
 points
 of
 view.
 Um
 but
 but
 where


those
 points
 of
 view
 are
 corrected
 by
 uh


human
 editors
 with
 community
 notes
 and


the
 the
 essence
 of
 community
 notes
 is


that
 uh
 people
 who
 historically
 disagree


agree
 that
 this
 community
 note
 was


correct.


So
 this
 um
 and
 and
 and
 all
 of
 the


community
 notes
 uh
 code
 is
 open
 source


and
 the
 data
 is
 open
 source.
 So
 you
 can


recreate
 any
 community
 note
 uh
 from


scratch
 as
 independently.


>> By
 and
 large
 it's
 worked
 very
 well.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 think
 we
 originally
 had
 the
 idea
 to


have
 you
 back
 on
 the
 pod
 because
 it
 was


a
 three-year
 anniversary
 of
 the
 Twitter


acquisition.
 So


>> Okay.


>> I
 just
 wanted
 to
 kind
 of
 reminisce
 a


little
 bit


>> and
 I
 remember
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 I
 remember


>> where's
 that
 sink?


>> Where's
 that
 sink?
 Well,
 yeah.
 So,
 Elon


was
 staying
 at
 my
 house.
 We
 had
 talked


the
 week
 before
 and
 he
 told
 me
 the
 deal


was
 going
 to
 close.
 And
 so,
 I
 was
 like,


"Hey,
 do
 you
 need
 a
 place
 to
 stay?"
 And


he
 took
 me
 up
 on
 it.
 And
 the
 day
 before


he
 went
 to
 the
 Twitter
 office,
 there
 was


a
 request
 made
 to
 to
 my
 staff.
 Do
 you


happen
 to
 have
 an
 extra
 sink?
 And
 they


did
 not,
 but
 they
 were
 able
 to
 uh


>> Who
 has
 an
 extra
 sink
 really?


>> But
 they
 were
 able
 to
 to
 locate
 one
 at
 a


nearby
 hardware
 store.
 And
 I
 think
 they


paid
 extra
 to
 get
 it
 out
 of
 the
 window


or
 something.


Well,
 I
 I
 think
 the
 store
 was
 confused


because
 um
 my
 security
 team
 was
 asking


for
 uh
 any
 kind
 of
 sink
 and
 and
 and
 like


like
 normally
 people
 wouldn't
 ask
 for


any
 kind
 of
 sink
 because
 you
 need
 a
 sink


that
 fits
 in
 your
 bathroom
 or
 connects


to
 a
 certain
 kind
 of
 plumbing.
 So


they're
 like
 trying
 to
 ask
 these
 like


well
 what
 kind
 of
 faucets
 do
 you
 want?


That's
 no
 no
 I
 just
 wanted
 a
 sink.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 mental
 person
 going


the
 store
 was
 confused
 that
 we
 just


wanted
 a
 sink


>> and
 didn't
 and
 didn't
 care
 what
 what
 the


sink
 connected
 to.


>> That
 was
 that
 was
 just
 they
 were
 like


almost
 not
 letting
 us
 buy
 the
 sink


because
 because
 they
 they
 thought
 maybe


we'd
 buy
 the
 wrong
 sink,
 you
 know.
 Um


it's
 just
 rare
 that
 somebody
 wants
 a


sink
 for
 sake


>> for
 meme
 purposes.
 One
 of
 my
 favorite


memories
 was
 Elon
 said,
 "Hey,
 you
 know,


swing
 by,
 check
 it
 out."
 I
 said, "Okay,


I'll
 come
 by."
 And
 I
 drive
 up
 there
 and


I'm
 looking
 where
 to
 park
 the
 car
 and
 I


realize
 there's
 just
 parking
 spaces


around
 the
 entire
 bis
 building.
 And
 I'm


like,
 "Okay,
 this
 can't
 be
 like
 legal


parking."
 But
 I
 park
 and
 it's
 legal


parking.


>> Yeah.


>> You're
 in
 downtown
 SF,
 so
 you
 might
 get


your
 window
 broken,
 but


>> Yeah.
 I
 might
 not
 be
 there
 when
 I
 get


back.
 But
 we
 get
 in
 there
 and
 the
 place


is
 empty.
 And
 then


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It
 it
 was
 seriously
 empty


except
 for
 the
 cafeteria.


>> There
 was
 an
 entire
 uh
 there
 were
 two


the
 TW
 headquarters
 was
 two
 buildings.


One
 of
 the
 buildings
 was
 completely
 and


utterly
 empty.
 Um
 and
 the
 other
 building


uh
 had
 like
 5%
 occupancy


>> and
 the
 5%
 occupier,


we
 all
 go
 get
 something
 to
 eat
 and
 we


realize
 there's
 more
 people
 working
 in


the
 cafeteria


>> than
 at
 Twitter.


There
 were
 more
 people
 making
 the
 food


than
 eating
 the
 food


in
 this
 giant
 caf
 giant
 really
 nice


really
 nice
 cafeteria.


Um
 the
 you
 know
 this
 this
 is
 where
 we


discovered
 that
 the
 the
 actual
 price
 of


of
 the
 lunch
 was
 $400.
 Um


>> uh
 the
 the
 original
 price
 was
 $20,
 but


it
 had
 five
 it
 went
 for
 it
 was
 at
 5%


occupancy.
 So
 it
 was
 20
 times
 higher
 and


they
 still
 kept
 making
 the
 same
 amount


pretty
 much.
 So,
 and
 charging
 the
 same


amount.
 So,
 effectively
 lunch
 was
 four


$400.


Um,
 and


>> that
 was
 a
 great
 meeting.


>> Yes.
 And
 and
 then
 and
 then
 there
 was


that
 that
 that
 uh
 where
 we
 had
 the


initial
 meetings
 sort
 of
 the
 sort
 of


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 the
 heck's


going
 on
 meetings
 in
 the
 in
 in
 these
 in


the
 because
 you
 know
 there's
 the
 two


buildings
 two
 Twitter
 buildings
 and
 one


the
 one
 with
 literally
 no
 one
 in
 it.
 Um


that's
 that's
 where
 we
 had
 the
 initial


meetings.
 Um
 and
 um
 and
 then
 and
 we


tried
 drawing
 on
 the
 whiteboard
 and
 the


and
 the
 the
 markers
 had
 had
 gone
 dry.
 So


that


nobody
 had
 used
 the
 the
 whiteboard


markers
 in
 like
 two
 years.


>> So
 sad.


>> None
 of
 the
 markers
 worked.
 So
 like
 this


is
 totally
 bizarre.
 But
 it
 was
 it
 was


totally
 clean
 because
 the
 the
 cleaning


crew
 had
 come
 in
 and
 done
 their
 job
 and


cleaned
 cleaned
 an
 already
 clean
 place


for
 I
 don't
 know
 two
 three
 years


straight.
 Um
 it
 was


I
 mean
 honestly
 this
 is
 this
 is
 this
 is


more
 crazy
 than
 any
 sort
 of
 Mike
 Judge


movie
 or
 or
 you
 know
 Silicon
 Valley
 or


anything
 like
 that.
 Um
 and
 and
 then
 we
 I


remember
 going
 into
 the
 men's
 bathroom


and
 and and
 there's
 there's
 there's
 a


table
 um
 with
 uh
 you
 know
 um
 uh


>> hygiene


>> menstrual
 hygiene
 products.


>> Yep.


>> Yeah.
 Um


>> refreshed
 every
 week.


>> Tampons
 like
 a
 fresh
 box
 of
 tampons.
 Um


and
 and
 we're
 like
 but
 but
 there's


literally
 no
 one
 in
 this
 building.
 Um,


so,
 uh,
 but
 no,
 no,
 they
 hadn't
 turned


off
 the
 send
 t
 send
 fresh
 tampons
 to
 the


man's
 bathroom
 in
 the
 empty
 building
 had


not
 been
 turned
 off.


>> No.


>> So,
 so
 every
 week
 they
 would
 put
 a
 fresh


box
 of
 tampons
 in
 an
 empty
 building
 um


for
 years.
 This
 happened
 for
 years.
 And


it
 must
 have
 been
 very
 confusing
 to
 the


people
 that
 were
 being
 asked
 to
 do
 this


because
 they're
 like,


>> "Okay,
 I'll
 throw
 them
 away."
 Well,
 I


remember
 when
 you
 But


>> I
 guess
 they're
 paying
 us.
 So,
 we'll


just
 put
 tampon.
 So,
 seriously,
 have
 to


consider
 the
 the
 the
 string
 of


possibilities
 necessary
 in
 order
 for


anyone
 to
 possibly
 use
 that
 tampon
 in


the
 men's
 bathroom
 uh
 at
 the
 unoccupied


second
 building
 of
 Twitter
 headquarters.


Um
 because
 you'd
 have
 to
 be
 a
 burglar
 um


who
 is
 a
 transman
 burglar
 um


who's
 unwilling
 to
 use
 the
 woman's


bathroom
 that
 also
 has
 tampons.


>> Statistically
 there's
 no
 one
 in
 the


building.
 So
 you've
 broken
 into
 the


building


and
 at
 that
 moment
 you
 have
 a
 period.


>> Yes.
 And
 you're
 on
 your
 period.


I
 mean,
 you're
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 struck


by
 a
 a
 meteor
 um
 than
 need
 that
 tampon.


Okay.


>> Well,
 I
 remember
 it
 was


>> I
 think
 it
 was
 shortly
 after
 that
 you


discovered
 an
 entire
 room


>> at
 the
 office
 that
 was
 filled
 with


Staywoke
 t-shirts.


>> Yeah.


>> Do
 you
 remember
 this?


>> An
 entire
 pile
 of
 merch.


>> Yeah.


>> Yes.


>> #
 staywoke.


>> Staywoke.
 and
 also
 a
 big
 sort
 of
 buttons


like
 those
 magnetic
 buttons
 that
 you
 put


on
 your
 shirt
 that
 said
 uh
 uh
 I
 I
 am
 an


engineer.
 Um,
 I'm
 like,
 "Look,
 if
 if


you're
 an
 engineer,
 you
 don't
 need
 a


button."
 Like
 a
 big


>> Who's
 the
 button
 for?
 Who
 you
 telling


that
 to?
 You
 can
 just
 ship
 code.
 We


would
 know.
 We
 can
 check
 your
 GitHub.


>> But
 yeah,
 they're
 like
 scarves,
 um,


hoodies,
 uh,
 all
 kinds
 of
 merch
 that


said
 hashtag
 stay.


>> Yeah.
 A
 couple
 music.


>> When
 you
 found
 that,
 I
 was
 like,
 my
 god,


man.
 The
 barbarians
 are
 fully
 within
 the


gates
 now.
 I
 mean


>> the
 barbarians
 have
 smashed
 through
 the


gates
 and
 are
 looting
 the
 merch.


>> Yes,
 you
 are
 rumaging
 through
 their
 holy


relics
 and
 defiling
 them.


>> I
 mean,
 but
 when
 you
 think
 about
 it,


David,
 the
 amount
 of
 waste
 that
 we
 saw


there
 during
 those
 first
 30
 days,


>> just
 to
 be
 serious
 about
 it
 for
 a


second,
 this
 was
 a
 publicly
 traded


company.
 So
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the


financial
 duty
 of
 those
 individuals,


there
 was
 a
 list
 of
 SAS
 software
 we
 went


through
 and
 none
 of
 it
 was
 being
 used.


Some
 of
 it
 had
 never
 been
 installed
 and


they
 had
 been
 paying
 for
 it
 for
 2
 years.


They've
 been
 paying
 for
 a
 SAS
 product


for
 two
 years.
 And
 the
 the
 the
 one
 that


blew
 my
 mind
 the
 most
 that
 we
 canceled


was
 they
 were
 paying
 a
 certain
 amount
 of


money
 per
 desk
 to
 have
 desking
 software


>> in
 an
 office
 where
 nobody
 came
 to
 work.


So
 they
 were
 paying


>> nobody.


>> There
 was
 there
 was
 millions
 of
 dollars


here
 being
 paid
 for
 for
 Yes.
 for
 um


analysis
 of
 pedestrian
 like
 software


that
 use
 cameras
 to
 analyze
 the


pedestrian
 traffic
 to
 figure
 out
 where


you
 can
 leave
 alleviate
 pedestrian


traffic
 jams
 uh
 in
 an
 empty
 building.


>> Right.


>> That's
 like
 11
 out
 of
 10
 on
 a
 Dilbert


scale.


>> Yeah.
 It
 was
 pretty
 shout
 out
 Scott


Adams.
 you've
 gone
 off
 scale
 on
 on
 your


doilbert
 level
 at
 that
 point.


>> Let's
 talk
 about
 the
 free
 speech
 aspect


for
 a
 second
 because
 I
 I
 think
 that
 is


the
 most
 important
 legacy
 of
 the
 Twitter


acquisition
 and
 I
 think
 people
 have


short
 memories
 and
 they
 forget
 how
 bad


things
 were
 three
 years
 ago.


>> First
 of
 all,
 you
 had
 figures
 as
 diverse


as
 President
 Trump,
 Jordan
 Peterson,
 Jay


Bacharia,
 Andrew
 Tate.
 They
 were
 all


banned
 from
 Twitter.
 And
 I
 remember
 when


you
 opened
 up
 the
 the
 Twitter
 jails
 and


reinstated
 their
 accounts,
 kind
 of,
 you


know,
 freed
 all
 the
 bad
 boys
 of
 free


speech.


>> The
 best
 deal.


>> Yes.
 So,
 you
 basically
 gave
 all
 the
 the


bad
 boys
 of
 free
 speech
 their
 their


accounts
 back.
 But
 second,
 beyond
 just


the
 the
 bannings,
 there
 was
 the
 shadow


bannings.
 And
 Twitter
 had
 claimed
 for


years
 that
 they
 were
 not
 shadowbanning.


This
 was
 a
 paranoid
 conservative


conspiracy
 theorist.


>> Yeah.


There
 was
 an
 a
 very
 aggressive
 shadow


banning
 by
 uh
 what
 was
 called
 the
 trust


and
 safety
 group
 which
 of
 course


naturally
 would
 be
 the
 one
 that
 is
 doing


the
 nefarious
 shadow
 banning.
 Um
 and
 I


just
 I
 just
 think
 we
 shouldn't
 have
 a


group
 called
 trust
 and
 safety.
 Um
 I
 mean


this
 is
 an
 orwellian
 name
 if
 you
 ever
 if


there
 ever
 was
 one.
 Um


>> hi
 I'm
 from
 the
 trust
 department.
 Oh


really?
 We
 want
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 about


your
 tweets.


>> Can
 we
 see
 your
 DMs?


>> Say
 that
 you're
 from
 the
 trust


department.
 It's
 literally
 that's
 the


Ministry
 of
 Truth
 right
 there.


>> Yeah.


>> Executives
 had
 they
 had
 maintained
 for


years
 that
 they
 were
 not
 engaged
 in
 this


practice
 including
 under
 oath.
 And
 on


the
 heels
 of
 you
 opening
 that
 up
 and


exposing
 that


>> because
 by
 the
 way
 it
 wasn't
 just
 the


fact
 they
 were
 doing
 it.
 They
 created
 an


elaborate
 set
 of
 tools
 to
 do
 this.
 They


had
 check
 box
 set
 of
 tools
 to
 to
 uh
 uh


Yes.
 to
 deboost
 uh
 accounts.
 Yes.


>> Yes.
 And
 you
 know
 subsequently
 we
 found


out
 that
 other
 social
 networking


properties
 have
 done
 this
 as
 well
 but


you
 were
 really
 exposed.


>> This
 is
 still
 being
 done
 at
 the
 other


social
 media
 companies


include
 Google
 by
 the
 way.
 Um,
 so,
 um,


for,
 you
 know,
 um,
 I
 don't
 pick
 on


Google
 cuz
 they're
 all
 doing
 it,
 but,


uh,
 for
 search
 results,
 uh,
 if
 you


simply
 push
 a
 result
 pretty
 far
 down
 the


page
 or,
 you
 know,
 the
 second
 page
 of


results
 like
 like
 you
 know
 the
 the
 joke


used
 to
 be
 or
 still
 is,
 I
 think,
 like


where
 do
 you
 hide
 a
 what's
 the
 best


place
 to
 hide
 a
 dead
 body?
 The
 second


page
 of
 Google
 search
 results
 because


nobody
 ever
 goes
 to
 the
 second
 page
 of


Google
 search
 results.
 They
 could
 you


could
 hide
 a
 dead
 body
 there
 and
 nobody


would
 find
 it.
 And
 and
 and
 you
 still


it's
 it's
 then
 then
 it's
 not
 like
 you've


you
 haven't
 made
 them
 go
 away.
 You've


you've
 just
 um
 put
 them
 on
 this
 one
 page


too.


>> Yes.
 So
 shadow
 banning
 I
 think
 was


number
 two.
 So
 first
 was
 banning,
 second


was
 shadow
 banning.
 I
 think
 third
 to
 me


was
 government
 collusion,
 government


interference.
 So
 you
 released
 the


Twitter
 files.
 Nothing
 like
 that
 ever


been
 done
 before
 where
 you
 just
 you


actually
 let
 investigative
 reporters


>> go
 through
 Twitter's
 emails


>> unfettered
 groups.
 I
 didn't
 I
 I
 I
 was


not
 looking
 over
 their
 shoulder
 at
 all.


I
 They
 just
 had
 direct
 access
 to


everything.


>> And
 they
 found
 that
 there
 was
 extensive


collusion
 between
 the
 FBI
 and
 the


Twitter
 trust
 and
 safety
 group
 where
 it


turns
 out
 the
 FBI
 had
 80
 agents


submitting
 takedown
 requests
 and
 they


were
 very
 involved
 in
 the
 banning,
 the


shadow
 banning,
 the
 censorship,
 which
 I


don't
 think
 we
 ever
 had
 definitive


evidence
 of
 that
 before.
 That
 was
 pretty


extraordinary.


>> Yeah.
 and
 and
 the
 the
 US
 House
 of


Representatives
 had
 hearings
 on
 the


matter.
 Um
 and
 and
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 this,


you
 know,
 was
 unearthed.
 It's
 it's


public
 record.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 some


some
 people
 on
 the
 left
 still
 think
 this


is
 like
 made
 up.
 I'm
 like,
 this
 is
 just


literally
 these
 the
 Twitter
 files
 are


literally
 the
 files
 at
 Twitter.
 I
 mean,


we're
 literally
 just
 talking
 about
 the


these
 are
 the
 emails
 that
 were
 sent


internally
 that
 confirm
 this.
 This
 is


what's
 on
 the
 Slack
 channels.
 Um
 and
 and


this
 is
 what
 is
 shown
 in
 the
 in
 the
 on


the
 Twitter
 database
 as
 where
 people


have
 made
 um
 either
 uh
 suspensions
 or


shadow
 bounds.


>> Has
 the
 government
 come
 and
 asked
 you
 to


take
 stuff
 down
 since
 or
 they
 just
 have


to
 the
 policy
 is
 hey
 listen
 you
 got
 to


file
 a
 warrant
 you
 got
 to
 you
 got
 to


come
 correct
 as
 opposed
 to
 just
 putting


pressure
 on
 executives.


>> Uh
 yeah
 our
 our
 policy
 at
 this
 point
 is


to
 follow
 the
 law.
 So
 um
 so
 if
 if
 now


now
 uh
 the
 laws
 are
 obviously
 different


in
 different
 countries.
 So
 sometimes
 you


know
 I
 I
 get
 criticized
 for
 like
 why


don't
 I
 push
 free
 speech
 in
 XYZ
 country


that
 doesn't
 have
 free
 speech
 laws.
 I'm


like
 because
 that's
 not
 the
 law
 there.


Um
 and
 and
 if
 we
 don't
 obey
 the
 law


we'll
 simply
 be
 blocked
 in
 that
 country.


Um
 so
 uh
 the
 the
 policy
 is
 really
 just


um
 adhere
 to
 the
 laws
 in
 any
 given


country.
 um
 uh
 it
 is
 up
 to
 us
 to
 agree


or
 disagree
 with
 those
 laws
 and
 if
 if
 uh


if
 if
 a
 people
 of
 that
 country
 want
 laws


to
 be
 different
 then
 they
 should
 you


know
 ask
 their
 leaders
 to
 change
 the


laws.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 but
 anything
 that
 but
 as
 soon
 as
 you


start
 going
 beyond
 the
 law
 now
 you're


putting
 your
 thumb
 on
 the
 scale.


>> Um
 so
 so
 the
 yeah
 that
 I
 I
 think
 I
 think


that's
 the
 right
 policy
 is
 just
 adhere


to
 the
 laws
 within
 any
 given
 country.
 Um


now
 sometimes
 we
 get
 you
 know
 um
 in
 a


bit
 of
 a
 bind
 like
 we
 had
 got
 into
 with


Brazil
 where
 uh
 you
 know
 this
 this
 this


judge
 in
 Brazil
 was
 asking
 us
 to
 or
 or


telling
 us
 to
 break
 the
 law
 in
 Brazil
 um


and
 ban
 accounts
 contrary
 to
 the
 law
 of


Brazil.
 And
 now
 we're
 now
 we're
 sort
 of


somewhat
 stuck.
 We're
 like
 wait
 a
 second


we're
 reading
 the
 law
 and
 it
 says
 this


is
 not
 allowed
 to
 happen
 and
 also
 that


and
 giving
 us
 a
 gag
 order.
 So
 like
 we're


not
 allowed
 to
 we're
 not
 allowed
 to
 say


it's
 happening.
 Um
 and
 we
 have
 to
 break


the
 law
 and
 the
 judge
 is
 telling
 us
 to


break
 the
 law.
 The
 law
 is
 breaking
 the


law.
 That's
 where
 things
 get
 um
 very


difficult.
 Uh
 and
 we
 were
 actually


banned
 in
 Brazil
 for
 a
 while
 because
 of


that.
 I
 just
 want
 to
 make
 one
 final


point
 on
 the
 free
 speech
 issue
 and
 then


we
 can
 move
 on
 is
 just
 I
 think
 people


forget
 that
 the
 censorship
 wasn't
 just


about
 co
 there
 was
 a
 growing
 number
 of


categories
 of
 thought
 and
 opinion
 that


were
 being
 outlawed.
 The
 quote
 content


moderation
 which
 is
 another
 Orwellian


euphemism
 for
 censorship
 was
 being


applied
 to
 categories
 like
 gender
 and


even
 climate
 change.
 The
 definition
 of


hate
 speech
 was
 constantly
 growing.


>> Yes.
 and
 more
 and
 more
 people
 were
 being


banned
 or
 shadowbanned
 and
 there
 was


more
 and
 more
 things
 that
 you
 couldn't


say.
 This
 trend
 of
 censorship
 was


growing.
 It
 was
 galloping
 and
 it
 would


have
 continued
 if
 it
 wasn't,
 I
 think,


for
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 decided
 to
 buy


Twitter
 and
 opened
 it
 up.
 And
 it
 was


only
 on
 the
 heels
 of
 that
 that
 the
 other


social
 networks
 were
 willing
 to,
 I


think,
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 chasened
 in
 their


policies
 and
 start
 to
 push
 back
 more.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 right.
 um
 once
 Twitter


broke
 ranks
 uh
 the
 others
 had
 to
 um
 it


became
 very
 obvious
 what
 the
 others
 were


doing
 and
 so
 they
 had
 to
 mitigate
 uh


their
 censorship
 substantially
 as


because
 of
 what
 Twitter
 did.
 And
 I
 mean


perhaps
 to
 give
 them
 some
 credit
 they


also
 felt
 that
 they
 had
 the
 air
 cover
 to


um
 to
 uh
 be
 more
 inclined
 towards
 free


speech.
 um
 they
 still
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 sort


of
 uh
 you
 know
 shadow
 banning
 and
 and


whatnot
 at
 at
 the
 other
 social
 media


companies,
 but
 it's
 it's
 much
 less
 than


it
 used
 to
 be.


>> Yeah.


>> Elon,
 what
 do
 you
 what
 have
 you
 seen
 in


terms
 of
 like
 governments
 creating
 new


laws?
 So,
 we've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of
 this


crackdown
 in
 the
 UK
 on
 what's
 being


called
 hateful
 speech
 on
 social
 media


and
 folks
 getting
 arrested
 and
 actually


going
 to
 prison
 over
 it.
 And
 it
 seems


like
 when
 there's
 more
 freedom,


the
 side
 that
 is
 threatened
 by
 that


comes
 out
 and
 creates
 their
 own
 counter,


right?
 There's
 a
 reaction
 to
 that.
 And


there
 seems
 to
 be
 reaction.
 Are
 you


seeing
 more
 of
 these
 laws
 around
 the


world
 in
 response
 to
 your
 opening
 up


free
 speech
 through
 Twitter
 and
 um
 and


those
 changes
 and
 what
 they're
 enabling


that
 that
 the
 governments
 and
 the


parties
 that
 control
 those
 governments


aren't
 aligned
 and
 they're
 stepping
 in


and
 saying,
 "Let's
 create
 new
 ways
 of


maintaining
 our
 control
 through
 law.


Um
 yeah,
 there
 there
 is
 there's
 been
 an


overall
 global
 movement
 to
 suppress
 free


speech
 um
 under
 the
 name
 of
 in
 in
 the


under
 the
 guise
 of
 suppressing
 hate


speech.
 Um
 but
 then
 uh
 you
 know
 it's
 the


problem
 with
 with
 that
 is
 that
 um
 your


freedom
 of
 speech
 only
 matters
 um
 if


people
 are
 allowed
 to
 say
 things
 that


you
 that
 that
 you
 don't
 like
 or
 even


that
 things
 that
 you
 hate.
 Um
 because
 uh


if
 if
 you're
 allowed
 to
 suppress
 speech


that
 you
 don't
 like
 uh
 then
 um
 and
 you


know
 you
 you
 don't
 have
 freedom
 of


speech
 and
 and
 and
 it's
 only
 a
 matter
 of


time
 before
 things
 switch
 around
 and


then
 the
 shoes
 on
 the
 other
 foot
 and


they
 will
 suppress
 you.


So
 uh
 suppress
 not
 lest
 you
 be


suppressed.


Um
 but
 but
 there
 there
 there
 is
 a
 uh
 a


movement
 and
 I
 I
 there
 was
 a
 very
 strong


movement
 to
 codify


speech
 suppression
 into
 the
 law


throughout
 throughout
 the
 world
 and


including
 the
 western
 world
 um
 you
 know


the
 Europe
 and
 Australia


>> UK
 and
 Germany
 very
 um
 yeah
 aggressive


in
 this
 regard.


>> Yes.
 And
 and
 my
 understanding
 is
 that
 in


the
 UK
 uh
 there's
 something
 like
 two
 or


three
 thousand
 people
 uh
 in
 prison
 for


social
 media
 posts.
 Um,
 and
 in
 fact
 that


this
 there there's
 so
 many
 people
 in


that
 were
 in
 prison
 for
 social
 media


posts.
 Um,
 and
 and
 many
 of these
 things


are
 like
 you
 you
 can't
 believe
 that
 that


someone
 would
 actually
 be
 put
 put
 in


prison
 for
 this.
 They
 they've
 they
 have


in
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 cases
 released
 people
 who


have
 committed
 violent
 crimes
 in
 order


to
 to
 imprison
 people
 who
 have
 simply


made
 posts
 on
 social
 media
 which
 is


deeply
 wrong.
 Mhm.


>> Um
 and
 and and
 uh
 underscores
 why
 the


founders
 of
 this
 country
 made
 the
 first


amendment
 the
 first
 amendment
 was


freedom
 of
 speech.
 Why
 why
 did
 they
 do


that
 is
 because
 in
 the
 places
 that
 they


came
 from
 there
 wasn't
 freedom
 of
 speech


and
 you
 could
 be
 imprisoned
 or
 killed


for
 for
 saying
 things.


>> Can
 I
 ask
 you
 a
 question
 just
 to
 maybe


move
 to
 a
 different
 topic?
 If
 you
 came


and
 did
 this
 next
 week,
 we
 will
 be
 past


the
 Tesla
 board
 vote.
 We
 talked
 about
 it


last
 week
 and
 we
 talked
 about
 how
 crazy


ISS
 and
 Glass
 Lewis
 is
 and
 right


>> we
 use
 this
 one
 insane
 example
 where


like
 Ira
 Aaron
 Prize
 didn't
 get
 the


recommendation
 from
 ISS
 and
 Glass
 Lewis


because
 he
 didn't
 meet
 the
 gender


requirements
 but
 then
 Kathleen


>> also
 it
 doesn't
 make
 sense.


>> Can
 you
 So
 the
 the
 board
 vote
 is
 on
 the


>> African-American
 woman.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 True.
 she
 they
 recommended
 against


her
 but
 then
 also
 recommended
 against


our
 enterprise
 um
 on
 on
 the
 ground
 she


was
 insufficiently
 diverse.
 So
 I'm
 like


this
 like
 these
 things
 don't
 make
 any


sense.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 I
 do
 think
 we've
 got
 a


fundamental
 issue
 with
 corporate


governance
 um
 in
 publicly
 traded


companies
 where
 you've
 got
 about
 half
 of


the
 stock
 market
 uh
 is
 controlled
 by


passive
 index
 funds
 um
 and
 most
 of
 them


out
 most
 of
 them
 outsource
 their


decision
 uh
 to
 uh
 advisory
 firms
 and


particularly
 glass
 and
 uh
 ISS
 I
 call


them
 corporate
 ISIS
 um
 you
 know
 so
 all


they
 do
 is
 basically
 just
 they're
 just


terrorists
 Um
 so
 um
 so
 and
 and
 they
 have


they
 own
 no
 stock
 in
 any
 of
 these


companies.
 Um
 right


>> so
 I
 I
 think
 that
 this
 there's
 a


fundamental
 breakdown
 of
 producer


responsibility
 here
 uh
 where
 really
 um


you
 know
 any
 company
 that's
 managing
 um


uh


even
 though
 they're
 passively
 managing


you
 know
 index
 funds
 or
 whatever
 that


they
 do
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day
 have
 a


fiduciary
 duty
 to
 uh
 vote
 uh
 you
 know


along
 the
 lines
 of
 what
 would
 maximize


the
 the
 shareholder
 returns
 because


people
 are
 counting
 on
 them
 like
 people


uh
 you
 know
 have
 say
 you
 know
 So
 has


have
 all
 their
 savings
 and
 say
 401k
 or


something
 like
 that.
 Um
 and
 they're


they're
 counting
 on
 um
 the
 index
 funds


to
 vote
 uh
 do
 company
 votes
 in
 the


direction
 that
 would
 uh
 ensure
 that


their
 retirement
 savings
 uh
 do
 as
 well


as
 possible.
 But
 the
 problem
 is
 if
 that


is
 then
 outsourced
 to
 ISS
 and
 glass


Lewis
 which
 have
 been
 infiltrated
 by


far-left
 activists
 um
 because
 you
 know


you
 know
 where
 far
 you
 know
 you
 know
 you


know
 basically
 political
 activists
 go


they
 go
 where
 the
 where
 the
 power
 is.


>> Um
 and
 so
 effectively
 uh
 glass
 and
 ISS


uh
 uh
 control
 the
 vote
 of
 half
 the
 stock


market.


Now,
 now
 if
 you're
 a
 political
 activist,


you
 know
 what
 a
 great
 place
 would
 be
 to


go
 work


and
 glass
 doors.
 And
 they
 do.


So,
 um,
 so
 my
 concern
 for
 the
 future,


um,
 because
 this,
 you
 know,
 the
 Tesla,


um,
 thing
 is
 is
 it's
 called
 sort
 of


compensation,
 but
 really
 it's
 not
 about


compensation.
 It's
 not
 like
 I'm
 going to


go
 out
 and
 buy,
 you
 know,
 a
 yacht
 with


it
 or
 something.
 It's
 just
 that
 I
 I I
 do


I
 in
 order
 if
 I'm
 going
 to
 build
 up


Optimus
 and
 and
 you
 know
 have
 all
 these


robots
 out
 there,
 I
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 we


do
 not
 have
 a
 terminated
 scenario
 and
 I


and
 that
 I
 can
 make
 you
 know
 maximize


the
 safety
 of
 the
 robots.
 Um
 and
 and
 and


um
 but
 but
 I
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 I
 need
 to


have
 something
 like
 a
 25%
 vote.
 Um
 which


is
 enough
 of
 a
 vote
 to
 have
 a
 strong


influence
 uh
 but
 not
 so
 much
 of
 a
 vote


that
 I
 can't
 be
 fired
 if
 I
 go
 insane.
 Um


so
 it's
 it's
 kind
 of
 but
 but
 my
 concern


would
 be,
 you
 know,
 creating
 this
 army


of
 robots
 and
 then
 and
 then
 being
 fired


for
 political
 reasons
 um
 because
 of


because
 of
 ISS
 and
 Glass
 Lewis.
 uh
 uh


you
 know
 declined
 to
 ISIS
 and
 Glass


Lewis
 fire
 me
 effectively
 or
 or
 the
 the


activists
 at
 those
 bones
 fire
 me.
 Um


even
 though
 I've
 done
 everything
 right.


>> Yeah,


>> that's
 my
 concern.


>> And
 then
 I
 and
 then
 then
 you've
 got
 and


then
 I
 and
 then
 I
 cannot
 ensure
 this
 the


safety
 of
 the
 robots.


>> If
 you
 don't
 get
 that
 vote,
 if
 it


doesn't
 go
 your
 way,
 it
 looks
 like
 it's


going
 to,
 would
 you
 leave?
 I
 mean,
 is


that
 even
 in
 the
 cards?
 I
 heard
 they


were
 the
 board
 was
 very
 concerned
 about


that.


>> Uh,


let's
 just
 say
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 build
 a


robot
 on
 me.
 Um,
 if
 I
 if
 I
 can
 be
 easily


kicked
 out
 by
 activist
 investors.


>> Yeah.


>> No
 way.


>> No
 way.
 Yeah.
 Makes
 sense.
 I
 mean,
 and


who
 is
 capable
 of
 running
 the
 four
 or


five
 major
 product
 lines
 at
 Tesla?
 I


mean,
 this
 is
 the
 the
 madness
 of
 it.


It's
 a
 very
 complex
 business.
 People


don't
 understand
 what's
 under
 the
 hood


there.
 It's
 not
 just
 a
 car
 company.
 You


got
 batteries,
 you
 got
 trucks,
 you
 got


the
 self-driving
 group,
 and
 this
 is
 a


very
 complex
 buil
 business
 that's
 you've


built
 over
 decades
 now.
 It's
 it's
 not
 a


very
 simple
 thing
 to
 run.
 I
 don't
 think


there's
 a
 Elon
 equivalent
 out
 there
 who


can
 just
 jump
 into
 the
 cockpit.
 By
 the


way,
 if
 we
 take
 a
 full
 turn
 around


corporate
 governance
 corner


also
 this
 week,
 what
 was
 interesting


about
 the
 OpenAI
 restructuring
 was
 I


read
 the
 letter
 and
 your
 lawsuit
 was


excluded


>> from
 the
 allowances
 of
 the
 California


attorney
 general
 basically
 saying
 this


thing
 can
 go
 through
 which
 means
 that


your
 lawsuit
 is
 still
 out
 there,
 right?


And
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 go
 to
 a
 jury


trial.


>> Yes.


>> So
 there
 that
 corporate
 governance
 thing


is
 still
 very
 much
 in
 question.
 Do
 you


have
 any
 thoughts
 on
 that?


>> Um,
 yes.
 I
 believe
 that
 will
 go
 to
 a


jury
 trial
 in
 February
 or
 March.
 Um,
 and


and
 then
 we'll
 see
 what
 the
 what
 the


results
 are
 there.
 But
 um
 there's


there's
 an
 like
 a
 mountain
 of
 evidence


um
 that
 that
 shows
 that
 OpenAI
 was


created
 as
 a
 u
 an
 open
 source
 nonprofit.


It's
 it's
 literally
 that's
 the
 the
 exact


description
 in
 the
 incorporation


documents.
 Um
 and
 in
 fact
 the


incorporation
 documents
 explicitly
 say


that
 no
 officer
 uh
 or
 founding
 member


will
 be
 will
 will
 benefit
 financially


from
 open
 AI


>> and
 they've
 completely
 violated
 that
 and


more
 of
 you
 can
 then
 you
 can
 just
 use


the
 wayback
 machine
 and
 look
 at
 the
 the


website
 of
 OpenAI
 again
 open
 source


nonprofit
 open
 source
 nonprofit
 the


whole
 way
 until
 you
 know
 it
 it
 looked


like
 wow
 this
 is
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 money


to
 be
 gained
 here
 and
 then
 suddenly
 it


starts
 changing


Um,
 and
 they
 try
 to
 change
 the


definition
 of
 open
 AI
 to
 mean
 open
 to


everyone
 instead
 of
 open
 source,
 even


though
 it
 always
 meant
 open
 source.


>> I
 came
 up
 with
 the
 name.


>> Yeah,


>> that's
 how
 I
 know.


So


uh
 if
 they
 open
 sourced
 it
 uh
 or
 they


gave
 you
 I
 mean
 you
 don't
 need
 the
 money


but
 if
 they
 gave
 you
 the
 percentage


ownership
 in
 it
 that
 you
 would
 be


rightfully
 uh
 which
 50
 million
 for
 a


startup
 would
 be
 half
 at
 least
 but
 they


must
 have
 made
 an
 overture
 toward
 you


and
 said
 hey
 can
 we
 just
 give
 you
 10%
 of


this
 thing
 and
 give
 us
 your
 blessing


like
 you
 obviously
 have
 a
 different
 goal


here.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 I
 mean,
 essentially
 since
 I


came
 up
 with
 the
 idea
 for
 the
 company,


named
 it,
 um,
 provided
 the
 AB
 and
 C


rounds
 of
 funding,
 uh,
 recruited
 the,


uh,
 critical
 personnel,
 uh,
 and
 told


them
 everything
 I
 know.
 Um,


you
 know,
 if
 that
 had
 been
 a
 a


commercial
 corporation,
 I'd
 probably
 own


half
 the
 company.


So,
 um,
 but
 and
 and
 I
 I
 I
 could
 have


chosen
 to
 do
 that.
 that
 that
 I
 if
 I
 it


was
 totally
 at
 my
 discretion
 I
 could


have
 done
 that.
 Uh
 but
 I
 created
 it
 as
 a


nonprofit
 for
 the
 world,
 an
 open
 source


nonprofit
 for
 the
 world.


>> Do
 you
 think
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do
 is
 to


take
 those
 models
 and
 just
 open
 source


them
 today?
 If
 you
 could
 affect
 that


change,
 is
 that
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do?


>> Uh
 yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 uh
 that
 that


that
 is
 what
 the
 what
 it
 was
 created
 to


do.
 So
 it
 should
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 best


open
 source
 models
 right
 now
 actually


ironically
 because
 fate
 fade
 seems
 to
 be


an
 irony
 maximizer


>> um
 uh
 the
 best
 open
 source
 models
 are


generally
 from
 China.


>> Yeah.


>> Like
 that's
 bizarre
 and
 and
 and
 and
 then


I
 think
 the
 second
 best
 are
 one
 is
 or


maybe
 it's
 better
 than
 second
 best.
 Uh


but
 like
 the
 u
 the
 gro
 2.5
 um
 open


source
 model
 is
 actually
 very
 good.
 Um,


and
 I
 think
 we'd
 probably
 be
 and
 and


we'll
 continue
 to
 open
 source
 our


models,
 but
 you
 know,
 but
 whereas
 like


try
 using
 any
 of
 the
 the
 the
 recent
 um


so-called
 the
 OpenAI
 open
 source
 models.


They're
 out
 they
 don't
 work.
 They


basically
 they
 open
 sourced
 a
 broken


non-working
 version
 of
 of
 their
 models


as
 a
 fig
 leaf.


I
 mean,
 do
 you
 know
 anyone
 who's
 running


open
 open
 eyes
 open
 source
 models?


Exactly.


>> Yeah.
 Nobody.
 We've
 had
 a
 big
 debate


about
 jobs
 here.
 Obviously,
 there's


going to
 be
 job
 displacement.


You
 and
 I
 have
 talked
 about
 it
 for


decades.
 Uh


what's
 your
 take
 on
 the
 pace
 of
 it?


Because
 obviously
 building
 self-driving


software,
 you're
 building
 Optimus.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 we're
 seeing
 Amazon
 take
 some
 steps


here
 where
 they're
 like,
 "Yeah,
 we're


probably
 not
 going
 to
 hire
 these


positions
 in
 the
 future."
 And
 you
 know,


maybe
 they're
 getting
 rid
 of
 people
 now


because
 they
 were
 bloated,
 but
 maybe


some
 of
 it's
 AI.
 You
 know,
 it's
 it's
 all


debatable.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 the


timeline
 is?
 And
 what
 do
 you
 think
 as
 a


society
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 to
 do
 to


mitigate
 it
 if
 it
 goes
 too
 fast?


>> Well,
 um,


you
 know,
 I
 call
 AI
 the
 supersonic


tsunami.


So,
 um,
 not
 the
 most
 comforting


description
 in
 the
 world.
 Um,
 but


>> fast
 and
 big.


>> There
 was
 a
 tsunami,
 a
 giant
 wall
 of


water
 moving
 faster
 than
 the
 speed
 of


sound.
 as
 AI.


Um,


>> when
 does
 it
 land?


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 Um,


so
 and
 now
 this
 is
 happening
 whether
 I


wanted
 to
 or
 not.
 I
 I
 actually
 try
 to


slow
 down
 AI.


>> Um,
 and
 and
 then
 the
 the
 reason,
 you


know,
 I
 I
 uh
 the
 reason
 I
 wanted
 to


create
 Open
 AI
 was
 to
 serve
 as
 a


counterweight
 to
 Google
 because
 at
 the


time
 Google
 was
 uh
 sort
 of
 essentially


had
 unilateral
 power
 in
 AI.
 They
 had
 all


the
 all
 the
 AI
 essentially.
 Um
 and
 um


and
 uh
 you
 know
 Larry
 Page
 was
 not
 um


you
 know


he
 he
 was
 not
 taking
 safety
 seriously.


Um


uh
 I
 Jason
 Arere
 were
 you
 were
 you
 there


when
 he
 he
 called
 me
 a
 speciist?


>> Yes
 I
 was
 there.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 So


>> you
 were
 more
 concerned
 about
 the
 human


race
 than
 you
 were
 about
 the
 machines.


And
 uh
 yeah,
 you
 had
 a
 clear
 bias
 for


humanity.


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 I
 was
 exactly.
 I
 was
 like,


Larry,
 Larry,
 what
 like
 we
 need
 to
 make


sure
 that
 the
 AI
 doesn't
 destroy
 all
 the


humans.
 And
 then
 he
 called
 me
 a
 specist.


Um
 like
 racist
 or
 something
 for
 being


pro
 uh
 human
 intelligence
 instead
 of


machine
 intelligence.
 I'm
 like,
 well,


Larry,
 what
 side
 are
 you
 on?
 Um
 I
 mean,


you
 know,
 that's
 kind
 of
 a
 concern.
 and


and
 and
 then
 at
 the
 time
 the
 Google
 had


uh
 essentially
 a
 monopoly
 on
 AI.


>> Yeah.
 They
 bought
 DeepMind
 which
 you


were
 on
 the
 board
 of
 had
 an
 investment


in
 Larry
 and
 Sergey
 had
 invested
 in
 it


as
 well
 and
 it's
 really
 interesting.


>> Found
 out
 about
 it
 because
 I
 told
 him


about
 it.
 I
 I
 showed
 him
 some
 stuff
 from


Deep
 from
 Deep
 Mind
 and
 I
 think
 that's


how
 he
 found
 out
 found
 out
 about
 it
 and


and
 and
 acquired
 them
 actually.
 I
 got
 to


be
 careful
 what
 I
 say.
 Um,
 but
 but
 the


the
 the
 point
 is
 that
 it's
 like
 look,


Larry's
 not
 taking
 AI
 safety
 seriously


and
 and
 and
 and
 Google
 had
 essentially


all
 the
 AI
 and
 all
 the
 computers
 and
 all


the
 money.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 this
 is
 a


unipolar
 world
 where
 the
 guy
 in
 charge


is
 not
 taking
 things
 seriously.
 So,
 um,


and
 called
 me
 a
 speciist
 for
 being


prohuman.
 Um,
 what
 do
 you
 do
 in
 those


circumstances?


>> Yeah.


>> Build
 a
 competitor.


>> Yes.
 Um,
 so
 OpenAI
 was
 created


essentially
 as
 the
 opposite,
 which
 is
 an


open
 source
 nonprofit,
 the
 opposite
 of


Google.
 Um,
 now
 unfortunately
 it
 it
 it


needs
 to
 change
 its
 name
 to
 closed
 for


maximum
 profit
 AI.


>> Yeah.


>> Or
 maximum
 profit
 to
 be
 clear.


The
 most
 amount
 of
 the
 company
 the
 most


amount
 of
 profit
 you
 possibly
 get.


>> I
 mean
 it
 is
 so
 it
 is
 like
 like


>> it's
 comical
 when
 you
 hear
 when
 you
 hear


>> fate
 is
 an
 irony
 maximizer.
 You
 have
 to


say
 like
 what
 is
 the
 most
 the
 most


ironic
 outcome
 for
 a
 company
 that
 that


was
 created
 for
 to
 do
 open
 source
 non


nonprofit
 AI
 is
 it's
 super
 closed


source.
 It's
 tighter
 than
 Fort
 Knox.
 Um


the
 the
 AI
 open
 AI
 source
 code
 is
 locked


up
 tight
 in
 Fort
 Knox.
 Um
 and
 uh
 and


they
 are
 going
 for
 maximum
 profit
 like
 a


maximum
 like
 get
 the
 bourbon
 the
 steak


knife
 that
 you
 know


>> they're
 ready.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 the


the


you
 know
 like
 like
 they're
 going
 for
 the


buffet


and
 they're
 just
 diving
 head
 first
 into


the
 profit
 buffet.
 I
 mean
 it's
 or
 at


least
 aspiration
 the
 revenue
 buffet
 at


least
 profit.
 We'll
 see.
 Um


>> we
 are


>> I
 mean
 it's
 like
 it's
 like
 ravenous


wolves
 for
 revenue.


>> Ravenous


revenue
 buffet.


>> No,
 no,
 it's
 literally
 like


>> super
 villain.
 It's
 like
 Bond
 villain


level
 flip.
 Like
 it
 went
 from
 being
 the


United
 Nations
 to
 being
 Spectre
 in
 like


James
 Pondland.


>> When
 you
 hear
 him
 say,
 "I'm
 going
 to


when
 Sam
 says
 it's
 going
 to
 like
 raise


1.4
 trillion
 to
 build
 up
 data
 centers."


>> Yeah.
 No,
 but
 I
 think
 he
 I
 think
 he


means
 it.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 I
 would
 say


audacious,
 but
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 want
 to


Yeah.
 insult
 the
 word.
 It


>> actually
 I
 have
 a
 question
 about
 this.


>> How
 is
 that
 possible?
 In
 the
 earnings


call,
 you
 said
 something
 that
 was
 insane


>> and
 then
 I
 think
 the
 math
 actually
 nets


up,
 but
 you
 said
 we
 could
 connect
 all


the
 Teslas
 and
 allow
 them
 in
 downtime
 to


actually
 offer
 up
 inference
 and
 you
 can


string
 them
 all
 together.


>> I
 think
 the
 math
 is
 like
 it
 could


actually
 be
 like
 a
 100
 gigawatt.


>> Is
 that
 right?
 Do
 you


>> if
 if
 ultimately
 there's
 a
 Tesla
 fleet


uh
 that
 is
 um
 uh
 100
 million
 vehicles
 uh


which
 I
 think
 we
 probably
 will
 get
 to
 at


some
 point
 100
 million
 vehicle
 fleet
 um


and
 uh
 they
 have
 you
 know
 mostly


state-of-the-art
 uh
 inference
 computers


in
 them
 uh
 that
 that
 each
 say
 are
 uh
 a


kilowatt
 of
 inference
 computed
 um
 and


they
 have
 built-in
 um
 power
 and
 cooling


um
 and
 you
 know
 connect
 to
 the
 Wi-Fi.


>> That's
 the
 key.
 Yeah,
 exactly.


>> Um
 yeah,
 exactly.
 and
 and
 and
 and
 uh


that
 you'd
 have
 100
 gaws
 of
 inference


compute.


>> Elon,
 do
 you
 think
 that
 the
 architecture


like
 there
 was
 an
 attentionfree
 model


that
 came
 out
 the
 last
 week?
 There's


been
 all
 of
 these
 papers,
 all
 of
 these


new
 models
 that
 have
 been
 shown
 to


reduce
 power
 per
 token
 of
 output
 by


many,
 many,
 many
 orders
 of
 magnitude.


Like
 not
 just
 an
 order
 of
 magnitude,
 but


like
 maybe
 three
 or
 four.
 like
 what's


your
 view
 and
 all
 the
 work
 you've
 been


doing
 on
 where
 we're
 headed
 in
 terms
 of


power
 um
 per
 unit
 of
 compute
 or
 per


token
 of
 output.


>> Well,
 we
 have
 a
 a
 clear
 example
 of


efficient
 power
 efficient
 compute
 which


is
 the
 human
 brain.
 Um
 so
 um
 our
 brains


use
 about
 20
 watts
 um
 of
 power
 but
 and


of
 that
 only
 about
 10
 watts
 is
 higher


brain
 function.
 Most
 of
 it's,
 you
 know,


half
 of
 it
 is
 just
 housekeeping


functions,
 you
 know,
 keeping
 your
 heart


going
 and
 breathing
 and
 that
 kind
 of


thing.
 Um,
 so,
 so
 you
 got
 maybe
 10
 watts


of
 uh
 higher
 brain
 function
 in
 a
 human.


Um,
 and
 we've
 managed
 to
 build


civilization
 with
 10
 watts
 of
 uh
 of
 a


biological
 computer.
 Um,
 and
 that


biological
 computer
 has
 like
 a
 20
 year,


you
 know,
 boot
 sequence.
 Uh,
 so
 pretty


but
 but
 but
 it's
 very
 power
 efficient.


So
 uh
 given
 that
 uh
 humans
 are
 capable


of
 inventing
 um
 you
 know
 general


relativity
 and
 quantum
 mechanics
 and
 uh


or
 discovering
 general
 like
 like


inventing
 aircraft,
 lasers,
 the
 internet


and
 discovering
 physics
 with
 with
 a
 10


watt
 uh
 meat
 computer
 essentially
 um


uh
 then
 um
 there's
 clearly
 a
 a
 massive


opportunity
 for
 improving
 the
 uh


efficiency
 of
 AI
 compute.


Um
 it's
 because
 it's
 it's
 it's
 currently


many
 orders
 of
 magnitude
 away
 from
 that.


Um
 and
 and
 it's
 still
 the
 case
 that
 um
 a


a
 100
 megawatt


uh
 or
 even
 you
 know
 a
 gigawatt
 uh
 AI


supercomput
 at
 this
 point
 can't
 do


everything
 that
 a
 human
 can
 do.
 Uh
 it
 it


will
 be
 able
 to
 uh but
 it
 can't
 yet.
 Um


so
 but
 but
 we
 like
 said
 we've
 got
 this


obvious
 case
 of
 um
 human
 brains
 being


very
 power
 efficient
 and
 achieving
 and


and
 building
 civilization
 with
 with
 a


with
 a
 you
 know
 with
 with
 10
 watts
 of


compute
 um
 and
 and
 and
 and
 a
 very
 slow


and
 our
 our
 bandwidth
 is
 very
 low.
 So


that
 the
 the
 speed
 at
 which
 we


communicate
 information
 to
 each
 other
 is


extremely
 low.
 You
 know
 we're
 not


communicating
 at
 a
 terabyte.
 We're


communicating
 more
 at
 like
 10
 bits
 per


second.
 Um,
 so,


um,
 do
 you
 think
 that
 should
 naturally


lead
 you
 to
 the
 conclusion
 that
 there's


massive,
 uh,
 opportunity
 for
 being
 more


power
 efficient
 with
 with
 AI?
 And
 and
 at


Tesla
 and
 at
 XAI,
 we're
 both
 we
 we


continue
 to
 see
 massive
 improvements
 in


inference
 computer
 efficiency.
 Um,
 so


um,
 yeah.
 You
 think
 that
 there's
 a


moment
 where
 you
 would
 justify


stopping


all
 the
 traditional
 cars
 and
 just
 going


completely
 allin
 on
 cyber
 cab
 if
 you


felt
 like


the
 learning
 was
 good
 enough
 and
 that


the
 system
 was
 safe
 enough?
 Is
 is
 there


ever
 a
 moment
 like
 that
 or
 do
 you
 think


you'll
 always
 kind
 of
 dual
 track
 and


always
 do
 both?


>> I
 mean
 all
 of
 the
 cars
 we
 make
 right
 now


um
 are
 capable
 of
 being
 a
 robo
 taxi.
 So,


there's
 a
 little
 confusion
 of
 the


terminology
 because
 um
 the
 the
 our
 cars


look
 normal,
 you
 know,
 like
 the
 Model
 3


or
 Model
 Y
 looks
 it's
 a
 good
 looking


car,
 but
 looks
 looks
 normal.
 Um
 but
 it


has
 an
 advanced
 AI
 computer,
 an
 advanced


AI
 software
 and
 cameras,
 and
 we
 didn't


want
 the
 cameras
 to
 stick
 out.
 So,
 we


you
 know,
 so
 that
 that
 we
 wouldn't
 want


them
 to
 be
 ugly
 or
 stick
 out.
 So,
 so,


you
 know,
 we
 put
 them
 they're
 sort
 of
 in


unobtrusive
 locations.
 You
 know,
 the


forward
 looking
 camera
 cameras
 are
 in


front
 of
 the
 rearview
 mirror.
 Um
 the


side
 view
 mirrors
 are
 in
 the
 side


repeaters.
 Oh,
 this
 the
 side
 view


cameras
 are
 on
 the
 side
 repeaters.
 Um


the
 the
 rear
 camera
 is
 you
 know
 just
 in


the
 you
 know
 above
 the
 license
 plate


actually
 typically
 where
 the
 rear
 view


camera
 is
 in
 a
 car.
 Um
 and
 um
 you
 know


and
 and
 and
 the
 the
 diagonal
 forward


ones
 are
 in
 the
 B-pillars.
 Like
 if
 you


look
 closely
 you
 can
 see
 all
 the
 cameras


but
 but
 you
 have
 to
 look
 closely.
 We


just
 didn't
 want
 them
 to
 be
 to
 stick
 out


like
 you
 know
 warts
 or
 something.
 Um
 but


but
 actually
 all
 the
 cars
 we
 make
 um
 are


hyper
 intelligent
 um
 and
 have
 the


cameras
 in
 the
 right
 places.
 They
 just


look
 normal.
 Um
 and
 um
 so
 so
 all
 of
 the


cars
 we
 make
 are
 capable
 of
 unsupervised


full
 autonomy.
 Um
 now
 we
 we
 have
 a


dedicated
 product
 which
 is
 the
 cyber
 cab


um
 which
 has
 no
 no
 steering
 wheel
 or


pedals
 um
 which
 are
 obviously
 vestigial


in
 a
 autonomous
 world
 u
 and
 we
 start


production
 of
 the
 cyber
 cab
 in
 Q2
 next


year
 and
 we'll
 scale
 that
 up
 to
 to
 quite


high
 volume.
 I
 think
 ultimately
 we'll


make
 millions
 of
 cyber
 cabs
 per
 year.
 Um


but
 but
 but
 it
 is
 important
 to
 emphasize


that
 all
 of
 our
 cars
 are
 capable
 of


being
 robotic
 taxis.
 The
 Cyber
 Cab
 is


gorgeous.
 I
 told
 you
 I'd
 buy
 two
 of


those
 if
 you
 put
 a
 steering
 wheel
 in


them.
 And
 there
 is
 a
 big
 movement


online.


>> Putting
 a
 steering
 wheel.


>> People
 are
 begging
 for
 it.
 Why
 not?
 Why


not
 let
 us
 buy
 a
 couple?
 You
 know,
 you


know,
 just
 the
 first
 ones
 off
 the
 line


and
 drive
 them.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 they
 look


great.
 It's
 like
 the
 perfect
 model.
 You


always
 had
 a
 vision
 for
 a
 model
 2,


right?
 Like,
 isn't
 it
 like
 the
 perfect


model
 2
 in
 addition
 to
 being
 a
 cyber


cab?
 Look,
 the
 reality
 is
 people
 may


think
 they
 want
 to
 drive
 their
 car,
 but


the
 reality
 is
 that
 they
 don't.
 Um,
 how


many
 times
 have
 you
 been,
 say,
 in
 an


Uber
 or
 Lift
 and
 and
 you
 said,
 "You
 know


what?
 I
 wish
 I
 could
 take
 over
 from
 the


driver


and
 and
 and
 I
 wish
 I
 could
 get
 off
 my


phone
 and
 and
 take
 over
 from
 the
 Uber


driver
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 drive
 to
 my


destination."
 How
 many
 times
 have
 you


thought
 to
 thought
 that
 to
 yourself?


>> No,
 it's
 quite
 the
 opposite.


>> Zero
 times.
 Okay.


>> I
 have
 the
 Model
 Y
 and
 I
 just
 got
 14.
 I


have
 Juniper
 and
 I
 I
 got
 the
 141
 and
 I


put
 it
 on
 MadMax
 mode
 the
 last
 couple
 of


days.
 That
 is


>> MadMax


>> a
 unique
 experience.


>> I
 was
 like,
 "Wait
 a
 second.
 This
 thing


is
 driving
 in
 a
 very
 unique
 fashion."
 Um


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> It
 assumes
 you
 want
 to
 get
 to
 your


destination
 in
 a
 hurry.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 I
 I
 used
 to
 give
 drivers
 an


extra
 20
 bucks
 to
 do
 that


>> medical
 appointment
 or
 something.
 I


don't
 know.


>> Yeah.
 it,
 but
 it's
 it
 feels
 like
 it's


getting
 very
 close,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 be


very
 careful.
 You
 know,
 Uber
 had
 a


horrible
 accident
 with
 the
 safety


driver.
 Cruz
 had
 a
 terrible
 accident.


Wasn't
 their
 fault
 exactly,
 except,
 you


know,
 that
 somebody
 got
 hit
 and
 then
 it


they
 they
 hit
 the
 person
 a
 second
 time


and
 they
 got
 dragged.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 this
 is
 pretty
 high
 stakes.


So,
 you're
 being
 extremely
 cautious.
 The


car
 is
 the
 car
 is
 actually
 extremely


capable
 right
 now,


>> but
 we
 are
 being
 extremely
 cautious
 and


we're
 being
 paranoid
 about
 it
 because
 to


your
 point
 um
 even
 one
 accident
 would


would
 be
 headline
 news.
 Well,
 probably


worldwide
 headline
 news,


>> especially
 if
 it's
 a
 Tesla
 like
 Whimo
 I


think
 gets
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 pass
 I
 think


there's
 half
 the
 country
 or
 a
 number
 of


people
 probably
 would
 you
 know
 go
 extra


hard
 on
 you.


>> Uh
 yes.


>> Uh
 yeah,
 exactly.
 Um,


>> yeah.


>> Not
 everyone
 in
 the
 press
 is
 my
 friend.


>> Hadn't
 noticed.


>> Yeah.
 Some
 of
 them
 are
 a
 little


antagonistic.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 you
 just
 But
 people
 are


pressuring
 you
 to
 go
 fast.
 And
 I
 I
 think


is
 everybody's
 got
 to
 just
 take
 their


time
 with
 this
 thing.
 It's
 obviously


going
 to
 happen.
 But
 I
 I
 just
 get
 very


nervous
 that
 the
 the
 pressure
 to
 put


these
 things
 on
 the
 road
 faster
 than


they're
 ready
 is
 just
 uh
 a
 little
 crazy.


I
 I
 applaud
 you
 for
 putting
 the
 safety


monitor
 in,
 doing
 the
 safety
 driver.
 No


shame
 in
 the
 safety
 driver
 game.
 It's
 so


much
 the
 right
 decision
 obviously,
 but


people
 are
 criticizing
 you
 for
 it.
 I


think
 it's
 dumb.
 It's
 the
 right
 thing
 to


do.


>> Yes.
 And
 and
 we
 do
 expect
 it
 to
 take
 to


not
 have
 any
 um
 sort
 of
 safety
 uh


occupant
 or
 or
 there's
 not
 really
 a


driver
 that
 just
 sits


>> monitor


>> safety
 safety
 monitor.
 Just
 sits
 he
 just


sit
 they
 just
 sit
 in
 the
 car
 and
 don't


do
 anything.
 um


>> safety
 dude.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 so
 uh
 but
 we
 do
 expect
 that


that
 the
 cars
 will
 be
 driving
 around


without
 any
 any
 safety
 monitor
 um
 before


the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 So
 sometime
 in


December


>> in
 Austin.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 you
 got
 a
 number


of
 reps
 under
 your
 belt
 in
 Austin
 and
 it


feels
 like
 pretty
 well
 you
 guys
 have


done
 a
 great
 job
 figuring
 out
 where
 the


trouble
 spots
 are.
 Maybe
 you
 could
 talk


a
 little
 bit
 about
 what
 you
 learned
 in


the
 first
 I
 don't
 know
 it's
 been
 like


three
 or
 four
 months
 of
 this
 so
 far.


What
 what
 did
 you
 learn
 in
 the
 first


three
 or
 four
 months
 of
 the
 Austin


experiment?


>> Actually,
 it's
 it's
 gone
 pretty


smoothly.
 Um
 a
 lot
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 that


we're
 learning
 um
 are
 uh
 just
 how
 to


manage
 a
 fleet
 like
 because
 you've
 got


to
 write
 all
 the
 fleet
 management


software,
 right?
 So


>> yeah.


>> Um
 and
 you
 you've
 got
 to
 have
 write
 the


ride
 hailing
 software.
 You've
 got
 to


write
 basically
 the
 software
 that
 Uber


has.
 You've
 got
 to
 write
 that
 software.


It's
 just
 summoning
 a
 robot
 car
 instead


of
 a
 car
 with
 a
 driver.
 Um
 so
 so
 a
 lot


of
 the
 things
 we're
 doing
 we're
 we're


scaling
 up
 the
 number
 of
 cars
 um
 to
 say


say
 like
 what
 happens
 if
 you
 have
 a


thousand
 cars
 like
 so
 we
 you
 know
 we


think
 probably
 we'll
 have
 you
 know
 a


thousand
 cars
 or
 more
 um
 in
 the
 Bay
 Area


uh
 by
 the
 end
 of
 this
 year
 probably
 I


don't
 know
 500
 or
 more
 in
 the
 greater


Austin
 area
 um
 and
 you
 know
 if
 if
 if
 um


you
 know
 you
 have
 to
 you
 you
 have
 to


make
 sure
 the
 cars
 don't
 all
 for
 example


go
 go
 to
 the
 same
 supercharger


uh
 at
 the
 same
 time,


>> right?
 Um
 so
 uh
 or
 or
 don't
 all
 go
 to


the
 same
 intersection
 um


there's
 there's
 it's
 like
 what
 do
 these


cars
 do?
 And
 then
 like
 sometimes
 there's


high
 demand
 and
 sometimes
 there's


there's
 low
 demand.
 What
 do
 you
 do


during
 during
 those
 times?
 Uh
 do
 you


have
 the
 car
 circle
 the
 block?
 Do
 you


have a
 try
 to
 find
 a
 parking
 space?
 Um


the
 um
 and
 then
 you
 know
 sometimes
 the


like
 say
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 you
 know
 disabled


parking
 space
 or
 something
 but
 the
 the


writing's
 faded
 or
 the
 things
 faded.
 The


car's
 like
 oh
 look
 a
 parking
 space
 will


jump
 right
 in
 there.
 It's
 like


>> yeah
 get
 a
 ticket.


>> You
 got
 to
 look
 carefully
 make
 sure
 it's


it's
 like
 you
 know
 it's
 not
 a
 an
 illegal


parking
 space
 or
 or or
 or
 it
 sees
 it


sees
 a
 space
 to
 park
 and
 it's
 like


ridiculously
 tight
 but
 it's
 I
 can
 get
 in


there.
 Um,


>> but
 with
 like,
 you
 know,
 three
 inches
 on


either
 side.


>> Bad
 computer.


>> But,
 but
 nobody
 else
 will
 be
 able
 to
 get


in
 the
 car
 if
 you
 do
 that.
 Um,


>> so
 um,
 you
 know,
 there's
 just
 like
 all


these
 oddwall
 corner
 cases.
 Um
 and
 um


uh


>> and
 regulators
 like
 regulators
 are
 all


very
 um
 yeah
 they're
 they
 have
 different


levels
 of
 pnikiness
 and
 regulations


depending
 on
 the
 city
 depending
 on
 the


airport.
 I
 mean
 it's
 just


>> you
 know
 very
 different
 everywhere.


That's
 going
 to
 just
 be
 a
 lot
 of


blocking
 and
 tackling
 and
 it
 just
 takes


time.
 Elon,
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 another


>> in
 order
 to
 take
 people
 to
 San
 Jose


airport
 like
 San
 Jose,
 you
 actually
 have


to
 connect
 to
 San
 Jose
 airport
 servers.


Um,
 and
 because
 you
 have
 to
 pay
 a
 fee


every
 time
 you
 off.


>> So
 So
 the
 car
 actually
 has
 to
 has
 to
 do


a
 remote
 call.
 The
 robot
 car
 has
 to
 do,


you
 know,
 remote
 procedure
 call
 to
 two


San
 Jose
 airport
 servers
 to
 to
 uh
 say


I'm
 dropping
 someone
 off
 at
 the
 airport


and
 charge
 me
 whatever
 five
 bucks.
 Um,


which
 is
 like
 there
 all
 these
 like


quirky
 things
 like
 that.
 The
 the the


like
 airports
 are
 somewhat
 of
 a
 racket.


Um,


>> uh,
 yeah.


>> Um,
 so
 so
 that's
 like,
 you
 know,
 we
 had


to
 solve
 that
 thing.
 But
 it's
 kind
 of


funny.
 The
 robot
 car
 is
 like
 calling
 the


server,
 the
 airport
 server
 to
 to
 uh,
 you


know,
 charge
 it
 credit
 card
 or
 whatever


someone


>> to
 extend
 a
 fax.
 Yeah,
 we're
 going
 to
 be


dropping
 off
 at
 this
 time.
 But
 but
 it
 it


will
 soon
 become
 extremely
 normal
 to
 see


cars
 going
 around
 with
 no
 one
 in
 them.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Extreme


on
 just
 before
 uh
 we
 lose
 you,
 I
 want
 to


like
 ask
 if
 you
 saw
 the
 Bill
 Gates
 memo


that
 he
 put
 out.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 are


talking
 about
 this
 memo


like
 you
 know
 did
 I
 guess
 Billy
 G
 is
 not


my
 love.


>> Oh
 man.
 Like
 did
 did
 did
 climate
 change


become
 woke?
 Did
 it
 become
 like
 woke?


And
 is
 it
 over
 being
 woke?
 Like
 you
 know


like
 what
 happened
 and
 what's
 what
 what


happened
 with
 Billy
 G?
 I
 mean


>> you
 know
 that's
 a
 lot.
 Great
 question.


Great
 question.


>> Yeah.


you
 know,
 you
 you'd
 think
 that
 someone


like
 Bill
 Gates
 who
 clearly
 started
 a


tech,
 you
 know,
 started
 a
 technology


company
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


companies
 in
 the
 world,
 Microsoft,
 um


being
 uh
 you
 you'd
 think
 he'd
 be
 really


quite
 um
 you
 know,
 strong
 in
 the


sciences.
 Um
 but
 actually
 my
 at
 least


direct
 conversations
 with
 him
 have
 um
 he


he's
 he
 is
 not
 strong
 in
 the
 sciences


like
 like


yeah
 this
 is
 really
 surprising
 you
 know


like
 he
 he
 came
 to
 visit
 me
 at
 the
 Tesla


Gigafactory
 in
 Austin
 and
 was
 telling
 me


that
 it's
 impossible
 to
 have
 a
 long


range
 uh
 semitr


um
 and
 I
 was
 like
 well
 but
 we
 literally


have
 them
 um
 And
 you
 can
 drive
 them
 and


Pepsi
 is
 literally
 using
 them
 right
 now.


And
 you
 can
 drive
 them
 yourself
 or
 send


someone.
 Obviously,
 Bill
 Gates
 can
 drive


it
 himself,
 but
 you
 can
 send
 a
 trusted


person
 to
 drive
 the
 the
 truck
 and
 verify


that
 it
 can
 do
 the
 things
 that
 we
 say


it's
 doing.
 And
 he's
 like,
 "No,
 no,
 it


doesn't
 work.
 It
 doesn't
 work."
 And
 I'm


like,


"Um,
 okay."
 I'm
 like
 kind
 of
 stuck


there.


Then
 it's
 like
 I
 was
 like,
 well,
 so
 it


must
 be
 that
 um
 you
 disagree
 with
 the
 W


hours
 per
 kilogram
 of
 the
 battery
 pack.


So
 that
 you're
 you
 must
 think
 that


perhaps
 we
 can't
 achieve
 the
 energy


density
 of
 the
 battery
 pack
 or
 that
 the


W
 hours
 per
 mile
 of
 the
 truck
 is
 too


high
 because
 and
 and
 that
 when
 you


combine
 those
 two
 numbers,
 the
 range
 is


low.
 And
 so
 which
 one
 of
 those
 numbers


do
 you
 think
 we
 have
 wrong?
 And
 what


numbers
 do
 you
 think
 are
 correct?
 and
 he


didn't
 know
 any
 of
 the
 numbers.


And
 I'm
 like,
 well,
 then
 doesn't
 it
 seem


that
 it's
 perhaps
 um
 you
 know
 uh


premature
 to
 conclude
 that
 a
 long-range


semi
 cannot
 work
 if
 you
 do
 not
 know
 the


energy
 density
 of
 the
 battery
 pack
 or


the
 energy
 efficiency
 of
 the
 of
 the


truck
 chassis.


>> But
 yeah,
 he
 he's
 now
 taken
 a
 180
 on


climate.
 He's
 saying
 maybe
 this


shouldn't
 be
 the
 top
 priority.


>> Climate
 is
 gay.


It's
 just
 the
 climate
 is
 gay.
 That's


wrong.


>> It's
 totally


>> Will
 Gay
 said
 the
 climate
 is
 gay
 and


 Come
 on.


>> I
 maybe
 he's
 got
 some
 data
 he's
 got
 to


put
 up.
 Does
 he
 have
 to
 stand
 up
 a
 data


center
 for
 for
 Sam
 Alman
 or
 something?
 I


don't
 know.
 What
 is
 Azure?


>> I
 don't
 know.


>> He
 changed
 his
 position.
 I
 can't
 figure


out
 why.


I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 I
 mean,
 the
 the


reality
 of
 the
 whole
 climate
 change


thing
 is
 is
 that
 the
 um
 you
 know,
 you've


just
 had
 sort
 of
 people
 who
 say
 it
 it


doesn't
 exist
 at
 all
 and
 then
 people
 who


say
 it
 it's
 are
 super
 llamist
 and


saying,
 you
 know,
 RA
 is
 going
 to
 be


underwater
 in
 5
 years.
 And
 now
 obviously


neither
 of
 those
 two
 positions
 are
 true.


Um,


you
 know,
 the
 the
 reality
 is
 you
 can


measure
 the
 the
 carbon
 concentration
 in


the
 atmosphere.
 Again,
 you
 could
 just


literally
 buy
 a
 CO2
 uh
 monitor
 from


Amazon.
 It's
 like
 50
 bucks.
 And
 um
 you


can
 measure
 it
 yourself.
 Um
 and
 uh
 you


know,
 and
 you
 can
 say,
 okay,
 well,
 look,


the
 the
 the
 the
 parts
 per
 million
 of
 CO2


in
 the
 atmosphere
 has
 been
 increasing


steadily
 at
 2
 to
 three
 per
 year.
 Um
 at


some
 point
 if
 you
 uh
 continue
 to
 take
 to


take
 uh
 billions
 eventually
 trillions
 of


tons
 of
 carbon
 from
 deep
 underground
 and


transfer
 to
 the
 atmosphere
 and
 oceans.


So
 you
 transfer
 it
 from
 deep
 underground


into
 the
 surface
 cycle.
 You
 will
 change


the
 chemical
 constituency
 of
 the


atmosphere
 and
 oceans
 just
 you
 just


literally
 will
 um
 then
 you
 can
 only
 then


now
 you
 can
 say
 argue
 to
 what
 degree
 and


over
 what
 time
 scale.
 Um,
 and
 the


reality
 is
 that
 in
 my
 opinion
 is
 that


we've
 got
 at
 least
 50
 years
 uh
 before


it's
 a
 serious
 issue.
 Um,
 I
 don't
 think


we've
 got
 500
 years.
 Uh,
 but
 but
 we've


probably
 got,
 you
 know,
 50.
 Um,
 it's


it's
 not
 it's
 not
 5
 years.
 Um,
 so
 if


you're
 trying
 to
 get
 to
 the
 right
 order


of
 magnitude
 of
 accuracy,
 um,
 I'd
 say


the
 cons
 the
 concern
 level
 for
 climate


change
 is
 on
 the
 order
 of
 50
 years.
 It's


definitely
 not
 five
 and
 I
 think
 it


probably
 isn't
 500.
 Um
 so
 uh
 so
 really


the
 right
 course
 of
 action
 is
 actually


just
 the
 reasonable
 course
 of
 action


which
 is
 to
 lean
 in
 the
 direction
 of


sustainable
 energy
 um
 and
 uh
 and
 lean
 in


the
 direction
 of
 of
 solar
 um
 and
 of
 a


sort
 of
 a
 solar
 battery
 future
 and
 and


and
 and
 generally
 have
 the
 rules
 of
 the


system
 um
 uh
 lean
 in
 that
 direction.
 I
 I


I
 don't
 think
 we
 need
 massive
 subsidies,


but
 then
 we
 also
 shouldn't
 have
 massive


subsidies
 for
 the
 oil
 and
 gas
 industry.


>> Okay.
 So,
 the
 oil
 and
 gas
 gas
 industry


has
 massive
 tax
 writeoffs
 that
 they


don't
 even
 think
 of
 as
 subsidies.
 Um


because
 these
 things
 have
 been
 in
 place


for
 in
 some
 cases,
 you
 know,
 80
 years.


Um
 but
 they're
 not
 there
 for
 other


industries.
 So,
 when
 you've
 got
 special


tax
 conditions
 that
 are
 in
 one
 industry


and
 not
 another
 industry,
 I
 call
 that
 a


subsidy.
 Obviously,
 it
 is.
 But
 they've


taken
 it
 for
 granted
 for
 so
 long
 in
 oil


and
 gas
 that
 they
 don't
 think
 of
 it
 as
 a


subsidy.
 Um
 so
 the
 right
 course
 of


action
 of
 course
 is
 to
 remove
 in
 my


opinion
 to
 remove
 subsidies
 from
 all


industries.
 Um
 but
 but
 the
 the
 the


political
 reality
 is
 that
 the
 oil
 and


gas
 industry
 um
 is
 very
 strong
 in
 the


Republican
 party
 but
 not
 in
 the


Democratic
 party.
 So
 you
 you
 will
 not


see
 obviously
 even
 the
 tiniest
 subsidy


being
 removed
 from
 the
 oil,
 gas
 and
 coal


industry.
 In
 fact,
 there
 were
 some
 that


were
 added
 to
 the
 oil,
 gas,
 and
 coal


industry
 uh
 in
 in
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 big


bull.
 Um
 and
 uh
 and
 there
 were
 a
 lot
 a


massive
 number
 of
 of
 sustainable
 energy


incentives
 that
 were
 removed,
 some
 of


which
 I
 agreed
 with,
 by
 the
 way.
 Um
 some


of
 the
 incentives
 have
 gone
 too
 far.
 Um


but
 um
 anyway,
 the
 the
 the
 actual
 I


think
 object
 the
 correct
 scientific


conclusion
 in
 my
 opinion
 um
 and
 I
 and
 I


think
 one
 can
 back
 this
 up
 with
 with


solid
 reasoning.
 Ask
 ask
 rock
 for


example


uh
 is
 is
 that
 we
 should
 um
 we
 should


lean
 in
 the
 direction
 of
 moving
 towards


a
 sustainable
 energy
 future.
 um
 we
 will


eventually
 run
 out
 of
 uh
 oil,
 gas,
 and


coal
 to
 burn
 anyway
 uh
 because
 a
 fi
 it's


a
 it's
 a
 finite
 there's
 a
 finite
 amount


of
 that
 stuff
 um
 and
 we
 will
 eventually


have
 to
 go
 to
 something
 that
 lasts
 a


long
 time
 that
 is
 sustainable.


>> But
 to
 your
 point
 about
 the
 irony
 of


things,
 it
 seems
 to
 be
 the
 case
 that


making
 energy
 with
 solar
 is
 cheaper
 than


making
 energy
 with
 some
 of
 these
 carbon


based
 sources
 today.
 And
 so
 the
 irony
 is


it's
 already
 working.
 I
 mean
 the
 market


is
 moving
 in
 that
 direction.
 And
 this


notion
 that
 we
 need
 to
 kind
 of
 force


everyone
 into
 a
 model
 of
 behavior,
 it's


just
 naturally
 going
 to
 change


>> because
 we've
 got
 better
 systems.
 You


know,
 you
 and
 others
 have
 engineered


better
 systems


>> that
 make
 these
 alternatives
 cheaper
 and


therefore
 they're
 winning.
 Like
 they're


actually
 winning
 in
 the
 market,
 which
 is


great.


>> But
 they
 can't
 they
 can't
 win
 if
 there


are
 subsidies
 to
 support
 the
 old
 systems


obviously.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 the
 by
 the
 way
 there


are
 actually
 massive
 disincentives
 of


solo
 because
 the
 because
 China
 China
 uh


is
 a
 massive
 producer
 of
 solar
 panels.


They're
 doing
 China
 does
 an
 incredible


job
 of
 solar
 manufacturing
 of
 solar


panel
 manufacturing.
 Really
 incredible.


Um
 they
 have
 one
 like
 roughly
 one
 and a


half
 terowatts
 of
 of
 solar
 production


right
 now.
 Um
 and
 they're
 only
 using
 a


terowatt
 per
 year.
 By
 the
 way,
 that's
 a


gigantic
 number.
 um
 the
 the
 uh
 the


average
 uh
 US
 power
 consumption
 is
 only


half
 a
 terowatt.


So
 just
 think
 about
 that
 for
 a
 second.


China's
 uh


you
 know
 China's
 solar
 panel
 out


production
 max
 capacity
 is
 1
 and
 a
 half


terowatts
 per
 year.
 Uh
 US
 steadystate


power
 usage
 is
 half
 a
 terowatt.
 Now,
 now


you
 do
 have
 to
 to
 reduce
 you
 say
 if
 you


produce
 one
 and
 a
 half
 terowatts
 a
 year


of
 solar,
 you
 need
 you
 need
 to
 add
 that


with
 batteries,
 take
 into
 account
 the


the
 the
 differences
 between
 night
 and


day,
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 solar
 panel
 is


not
 always
 um
 pointed
 uh
 directly
 at
 the


sun,
 that
 kind
 of
 thing.
 So
 you
 can


divide
 by
 fiveish
 to
 say
 that
 but
 but


that
 still
 means
 that
 China
 has
 the


ability
 to
 produce
 solar
 panels
 that


have
 a
 steadystate
 output
 that
 is


roughly
 2/3
 that
 of
 the
 entire
 US


economy
 from
 all
 sources
 which
 means


that
 just
 with
 solar
 alone
 China
 can
 uh


in
 one
 in
 18
 months
 um
 produce
 enough


solar
 panels
 to
 power
 the
 entire
 the


United
 States
 all
 the
 electricity
 of
 the


United
 States.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 about


near
 field
 solar
 aka
 nuclear?


>> I'm
 in
 favor
 of
 look
 make
 make
 energy


from
 any
 any
 way
 you
 you
 you
 want
 that


that
 doesn't
 that
 isn't
 like
 obviously


harmful
 to
 the
 to
 the
 environment.
 Um


gen
 generally
 people
 don't
 welcome
 a


nuclear
 reactor
 in
 their
 backyard.
 Um


they're
 not
 like
 championing


>> put
 it
 here
 put
 it
 under
 my
 bed.


>> Put
 it


>> put
 it
 on
 my
 roof.
 What
 if
 if if
 if
 your


next
 door
 neighbor
 said,
 "Hey,
 I'm


selling
 my
 house
 and
 they're
 putting
 a


reactor
 there."


What
 would
 your
 you
 know,
 the
 typical


homeowner
 response
 will
 be
 negative.
 Um


it
 very
 few
 people
 will
 embrace
 a


nuclear
 reactor
 at
 um
 adjacent
 to
 their


house.
 Um
 so
 um
 but
 nonetheless,
 I
 I
 I


do
 think
 nuclear
 is
 actually
 very
 safe.


Um
 the
 it's
 it's
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 scare


mon
 sort
 of
 scaremongering
 and


propaganda
 around
 fision
 if
 assum
 you


talk
 about
 fision
 um
 and
 and
 but


fishision
 is
 actually
 very
 safe.
 They


obviously
 have
 this
 on
 you
 know
 the
 navy


US
 Navy
 has
 this
 on
 submarines
 and


aircraft
 carriers
 and
 with
 with
 people


really
 working
 right
 I
 mean
 a
 submarine


is
 a
 pretty
 crowded
 place
 and
 they
 have


a
 nuclearpowered
 submarine.
 So
 um
 so
 so


I
 think
 I
 think
 vision's
 fine
 as
 as
 a
 as


a
 as
 an
 option.
 Um
 the
 the
 regulatory


environment
 is
 makes
 it
 very
 difficult


to
 actually
 get
 that
 done.
 Um
 and
 and


then
 it
 is
 important
 to
 appreciate
 just


the
 sheer
 magnitude
 of
 the
 power
 of
 the


sun.
 So
 this
 is
 here
 are
 some
 just


important
 basic
 facts.
 Um
 even
 Wikipedia


has
 these
 facts
 right.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 so


you
 don't
 even
 have
 go
 to
 use
 the
 best


answer,
 but
 even
 Wikipedia
 has


>> Yeah.
 Even
 Wikipedia
 got
 it
 right.


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 I'm
 saying
 what
 I'm
 saying


even
 Wikipedia's
 got
 got
 these
 facts


right.
 Um,
 the
 the
 sun
 is
 about
 99.8%
 of


the
 mass
 of
 the
 solar
 system.


Uh
 then
 then
 Jupiter
 is
 about.1%.


And
 then
 everything
 else
 is
 in
 the


remaining.1%
 and
 we
 are
 much
 less


than.1%.
 Um,
 so,
 um,


if
 you
 burnt
 all
 of
 the
 mass
 of
 the


solar
 system,


okay,
 the
 then
 the
 total
 energy
 produced


by
 the
 sun
 would
 still
 round
 up
 to
 100%.


>> Mhm.


>> Like
 if
 you
 just
 burnt
 Earth,
 um,
 the


whole
 planet
 and
 burnt
 Jupiter,
 which
 is


very
 big
 and
 and
 quite
 challenging
 to


burn,
 uh,


uh,
 you
 you
 know,
 turn
 your
 gen
 nuc


Jupiter
 into
 thermonuclearacta


um
 it
 wouldn't
 matter
 the
 sun
 compared


to
 the
 sun
 the
 sun
 is
 99.8%
 8%
 of
 the


mass
 of
 the
 solar
 system
 and
 everything


else
 is
 in
 the
 miscellaneous
 category.


So,
 um
 like
 basically
 no
 matter
 what
 you


do,
 total
 energy
 produced
 um
 in
 our


solar
 system
 rounds
 up
 to
 100%
 from
 the


sun.
 You
 could
 even
 throw
 another


Jupiter
 in
 there.
 Um
 so,
 we're
 going
 to


snag
 a
 Jupiter
 from
 somewhere
 else.
 um


and
 uh
 somehow
 teleport
 you
 could


teleport
 two
 more
 Jupiters
 uh
 into
 our


solar
 system,
 burn
 them
 and
 the
 sun


would
 still
 round
 up
 to
 100%.


You
 know,
 soon
 as
 long
 as
 you're
 at


99.6%,


you're
 still
 rounding
 up
 to
 100%.
 Um


maybe
 that
 gives
 some
 perspective
 of
 why


solar
 is
 really
 the
 thing
 that
 matters.


and
 and
 and
 as
 soon
 as
 you
 start


thinking
 about
 things
 in
 at
 sort
 of
 a


grander
 scale
 like
 cautious
 of
 scale
 to


civilizations
 it
 it
 becomes
 very
 very


obvious
 it's
 like
 I'm
 not
 saying


anything
 that's
 new
 by
 the
 way
 like
 uh


anyone
 who
 studies
 physics
 has
 known


this
 for
 you
 know
 very
 long
 time
 um
 in


fact
 I
 think
 was
 a
 Russian
 physicist
 who


came
 up
 with
 this
 idea
 I
 think
 in
 the


'60s
 um
 just
 just
 as
 a
 way
 to
 classify


civilizations


um
 where
 ships
 scale
 one
 would
 be
 uh


you've
 used
 you're
 you're
 you've


harnessed
 most
 of
 the
 energy
 of
 of
 the


planet.
 Color
 ship
 scale
 two,
 you
 you've


harnessed
 most
 of the
 energy
 of
 your


sun.
 Carter
 ship
 three,
 you've
 harnessed


most
 of the
 energy
 of
 galaxy.


Um,
 now
 we're
 only
 about
 I
 don't
 know
 1%


or
 few
 a
 few%
 of
 cautious
 scale
 one


right
 now
 optimistically.
 Um,
 so,


um,
 but
 as
 soon
 as
 you
 go
 to
 Kship
 scale


2,
 where
 you're
 talking
 about
 the
 power


of
 the
 sun,
 then
 you're
 really
 just


saying,
 um,
 everything
 is
 solar
 power


and
 and
 and
 and
 the
 rest
 is
 in
 the


noise.
 Um,


and,
 um,
 yeah.
 So
 like
 the


you
 know
 like
 the
 sun
 produces
 about
 a


billion
 times
 or
 call
 it
 o
 well
 over
 a


billion
 times
 more
 energy
 than


everything
 on
 earth
 combined.


>> It's
 crazy.


It's
 mind-blowing,


>> right?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Solar
 is
 the
 obvious


solution
 to
 all
 this.
 And
 yeah,
 I
 mean


short
 term


>> have
 to
 use
 some
 of
 these
 other
 sources.


But
 hey,
 there
 it
 is.
 an
 hour
 and
 a


half.


>> Star
 powered.
 Like
 maybe
 we
 got
 a


branding
 issue
 here.


>> Yeah.
 Star
 powered.


>> Instead
 of
 solar
 powered,
 it's
 it's


starlight.


>> Yeah.
 Starlight.


>> It's
 the
 power
 of
 a
 a
 blazing
 sun.
 Um


>> How
 much
 energy
 does
 an
 entire
 star


have?


>> Yeah.


>> Well,
 a
 star.


>> More
 than
 enough.
 All
 right.


>> That's
 for
 sure.
 and
 and
 and
 also
 you


really
 need
 to
 keep
 the
 power
 local.
 Um


so
 sometimes
 people
 honestly
 this
 I've


had
 these
 discussions
 so
 many
 times
 it's


it's
 where
 they
 say
 would
 you
 beam
 the


power
 back
 to
 Earth?
 I'm
 like
 do
 you


want
 to
 melt
 Earth


>> because
 you
 would
 melt
 Earth
 if
 you
 did


that.


>> Um
 we'd
 be
 vaporized
 in
 an
 instant.
 Uh


so
 you
 you
 really
 need
 to
 keep
 the
 power


local.
 um
 you
 know
 basically
 distributed


power
 and
 and
 and
 and
 I
 guess
 most
 of
 it


we
 use
 for
 intelligence.
 Uh
 so
 it's
 like


you
 know
 the the
 future
 is
 like
 a
 whole


a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 um
 solar
 powered
 AI


satellites.


>> But
 the
 only
 the
 only
 thing
 that
 makes


the
 star
 work
 is
 it
 just
 happens
 to
 have


a
 lot
 of
 mass.
 So
 it
 has
 that
 gravity


>> to
 ignite
 the
 fusion
 to
 ignite
 the


fusion
 reaction,
 right?
 But
 like
 we


could
 ignite
 the
 fusion
 reaction
 on


Earth
 now.
 I
 don't
 know
 like
 if
 your


view
 has
 changed.
 I
 think
 we
 talked


about
 this
 a
 couple
 years
 ago
 where
 you


were
 pretty
 like
 we
 don't
 know
 if
 or


when
 fusion
 becomes
 real
 here
 but


theoretically
 we
 could
 take
 like
 10


>> I
 want
 to
 be
 clear
 my
 opinion
 on
 um
 uh


so
 um
 you
 know
 I
 studed
 physics
 physics


in
 college
 um
 at
 one
 point
 in
 high


school
 I
 was
 thinking
 about
 a
 career
 in


physics
 one
 of
 my
 sons
 actually
 does
 a


career
 is
 doing
 a
 career
 in
 physics
 but


my
 the
 problem
 is
 I
 came
 to
 the


conclusions
 that
 I'd
 be
 waiting
 for
 a


collider
 or
 or
 a
 telescope
 I
 don't
 have


any
 to
 get
 that
 class
 agree
 in
 physics


but
 I
 have
 a
 strong
 interest
 in
 the


subject.
 Um
 so
 um


so
 so
 my
 opinion
 on
 say
 creating
 a


fusion
 reactor
 on
 earth
 is
 I
 think
 this


is
 actually
 not
 a
 hard
 problem.
 Um


actually
 I
 mean
 it's
 a
 little
 hard.
 I


mean
 it's
 it's
 not
 like
 totally
 trivial


but
 if
 you
 just
 scale
 up
 a
 tamog
 uh
 the


the
 bigger
 you
 make
 it
 the
 easier
 the


problem
 gets.
 So,
 you've
 got
 a
 surface


to
 volume
 ratio
 uh
 thing
 where
 you
 know


you're
 trying
 to
 maintain
 a
 really
 hot


core
 while
 having
 a
 wall
 that
 doesn't


melt.


So,
 uh
 uh
 there
 a
 similar
 problem
 with


with
 rocket
 engines.
 You
 you've
 got
 a


super
 hot
 core
 in
 the
 rocket
 engine,
 but


you
 don't
 want
 the
 the
 walls
 the
 chamber


walls
 of
 the
 rocket
 engine
 to
 melt.
 So


you
 have
 a
 temperature
 gradient
 uh
 where


it's
 very
 hot
 in
 the
 middle
 and
 and
 and


it
 gradually
 gets
 cold
 enough
 as
 you
 get


to
 the
 uh
 perimeter
 as
 you
 get
 to
 the
 uh


you
 know
 the
 chamber
 walls
 in
 the
 rocket


engine
 where
 the
 it
 doesn't
 melt
 uh


because
 if
 you've
 lowered
 the


temperature
 um
 and
 and
 you
 got
 a


temperature
 gradient.
 So
 just
 if
 you


just
 scale
 up
 uh
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 donut


reactor
 tok
 um
 and
 um
 and
 and
 and


improve
 your
 surface
 to
 volume
 ratio


that
 becomes
 much
 easier
 and
 you
 you
 can


absolutely
 in
 my
 opinion
 I
 I
 think
 just


anyone
 who
 looks
 at
 the
 math
 uh
 you
 can


you
 can
 make
 a
 a
 a
 re
 a
 reactor
 that
 is


that
 generates
 more
 energy
 than
 it


consumes
 and
 the
 bigger
 you
 make
 it
 the


easier
 it
 is.
 And
 in
 the
 limit
 you
 just


to
 have
 a
 giant
 gravitationally


contained
 thermonuclear
 reactor
 like
 the


sun.
 So
 uh
 which
 requires
 no
 maintenance


and
 it's
 free.
 Um
 so
 this
 is
 also
 why


why
 would
 we
 bother
 doing
 that
 on
 making


a
 little
 itty
 bitty
 sun
 that's
 so


microscopic
 you'd
 barely
 notice
 um
 on


Earth
 when
 we've
 got
 the
 giant
 free
 one


in
 the
 sky.


>> Yeah.
 But
 we
 but
 we
 we
 only
 get
 a


fraction
 of
 1%
 of
 that
 energy
 on
 the


planet
 Earth.
 We
 have
 to
 go


>> much
 less%.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 So,
 we've
 got
 to
 figure
 out
 how


to
 wrap
 the
 sun
 if
 we're
 going
 to


harness
 that
 energy.
 That
 that's
 our


our
 longer


>> if
 people
 want
 to
 have
 fun
 with


reactors,
 you
 know,
 um
 that's
 that's


fine.
 Have
 fun
 with
 reactors.
 Um
 but


it's
 not
 a
 serious
 endeavor
 compared
 to


the
 sun.
 Um
 you
 know,
 it's
 it's
 it's


sort
 of
 a
 a
 fun
 it's
 a
 fun
 science


project
 to
 make
 a
 ther
 the
 nuclear


reactor,
 but
 it's
 not
 um
 it's
 not
 it's


it's
 just
 penis
 compared
 to
 the
 sun.
 and


and
 and
 even
 the
 this
 the
 solar
 energy


that
 does
 reach
 earth
 um
 is
 a
 gawatt
 per


square
 kilometer
 or
 roughly
 you
 know


call
 it
 2
 and
 1/2
 gawatt
 per
 square
 mile


um
 so
 that's
 a
 lot
 you
 know
 um
 and
 the


commercially
 available
 panels
 are
 around


25
 almost
 20
 26%
 efficiency
 and
 maybe


you
 know
 I
 mean
 you
 can
 and
 then
 you
 say


like
 if
 you
 pack
 it
 densely
 get
 an
 80%


packing
 density
 you're
 going
 uh
 which
 I


think
 you
 know
 you
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 places


you
 could
 get
 an
 80%
 packing
 density
 you


effectively
 have
 about
 uh
 you
 know


200
 megawatts
 per
 square
 kilometer


and
 and
 and
 you
 need
 to
 pair
 that
 with


batteries
 so
 so
 you
 have
 continuous


power
 um
 although
 our
 power
 usage
 drops


considerably
 at
 night
 so
 you
 need
 less


batteries
 than
 you
 think
 um
 and
 uh
 and


uh


>> and
 doesn't
 the
 doesn't
 the
 question


>> a
 rough
 way
 to
 like
 a
 very
 Maybe
 an
 easy


number
 to
 remember
 is
 is
 a
 a
 gigawatt


hour
 per
 square
 kilometer
 per
 day
 is
 is


a
 a
 roughly
 correct
 number.


>> But
 then
 doesn't
 your
 technical


challenge
 become
 the
 scalability
 of


manufacturing
 of
 those
 systems.
 So,
 you


know,
 accessing
 the
 raw
 materials
 and


getting
 them
 out
 of
 the
 ground
 of
 planet


Earth
 to
 make
 them
 to
 make
 enough
 of


them
 to
 get
 to
 that
 sort
 of
 scale
 and


that
 volume
 that
 you're
 talking
 about.


And
 as
 you
 kind
 of
 think
 about
 what
 it


would
 take
 to
 get
 to
 that
 scale,
 like
 do


we
 have
 an
 ability
 to
 do
 that
 with
 what


we
 have
 today?
 Like,
 can
 we
 pull
 that


much
 material
 out
 of
 the
 ground?


>> Yes.
 Solar
 panels
 are
 made
 of
 silicon,


uh,
 which
 is
 sand
 essentially.
 Um,
 and,


um,


>> I
 guess
 more
 on
 the
 battery
 side,
 but


>> Oh,
 the
 battery
 side.
 Yeah.
 So
 battery


on
 the
 battery
 side
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 the


like
 iron
 phosphate
 lithiumion
 battery


cells
 there
 you
 know
 earth
 I'd
 like
 to


throw
 out
 some
 like
 interesting
 factoids


here
 um
 if
 most
 people
 don't
 know
 uh
 if


you
 said
 um


as
 measured
 by
 mass
 what
 is
 the
 biggest


element
 what
 what
 is
 what
 is
 earth
 made


of
 me
 as
 measured
 by
 mass
 actually
 it's


it's
 iron


>> Iron
 yeah
 we're
 I
 think
 32%
 iron
 30%


oxygen
 and
 and
 then
 everything
 else
 is


in
 the
 remaining
 remaining
 percentage.


So,
 um
 we're
 basically
 a
 a
 rusty
 ball


bearing
 um
 is
 that's
 earth.
 Um
 and
 and


with
 with with
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 silicon


at
 the
 surface
 in
 in
 the
 form
 of
 sand.


Um
 and
 the
 the
 iron
 phosphate
 so
 so
 iron


phosphate
 lithium
 ion
 cells
 you
 iron


extremely
 common
 most
 common
 element
 on


earth
 even
 in
 the
 crust.
 Uh
 and
 then


phosphorus
 is
 also
 very
 common.
 Um
 and


um
 and
 then
 the
 the
 anode
 is
 is
 carbon


but
 also
 very
 common.
 And
 then
 lithium


is
 also
 very
 common.
 So
 the
 there's


actually
 you
 can
 you
 can
 do
 the
 math.
 In


fact,
 we
 did
 the
 math
 and
 published
 it


published
 the
 math,
 but
 nobody
 looked
 at


it.
 Uh
 um
 it's
 on
 the
 Tesla
 website
 um


that
 that
 shows
 that
 you
 can
 completely


power
 Earth
 with
 solar
 panels
 and


batteries.
 Um
 and
 uh
 there's
 no
 shortage


of
 anything.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 on
 that
 note,


>> yeah,
 go
 get
 to
 work,
 Elon,
 and
 just


power
 the
 Earth
 while
 you're


>> getting
 implants
 uh
 into
 people's
 brains


and
 uh
 satellites
 and
 other
 good
 fun


stuff.
 Good
 to
 see
 you,
 buddy.


>> Yeah,
 good
 to
 see
 you
 guys.


>> Yeah,
 thanks
 for
 stopping
 by
 anytime.


Thanks
 for
 doing
 this.
 You
 got
 the
 Zoom


link.
 Stop
 by
 anytime.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 coming
 today
 and
 thank
 you


for
 liberating
 free
 speech
 three
 years


ago.
 So,


>> yeah,


>> that
 was
 that
 was
 a
 very
 important


milestone.


>> And
 and
 I
 see
 all
 you
 guys
 are
 in
 just


different
 different
 places.
 I
 guess
 this


is
 a
 very
 virtual
 situation.


>> Always
 been
 that.
 I'm
 at
 the
 ranch.
 Sex


is
 on
 the


>> Are
 you
 ever
 in
 the
 same
 room?


>> We
 try
 not
 to
 be.
 only
 when
 we
 do
 only


only
 when
 we
 do
 that
 that
 summit.
 But


otherwise,
 we
 each


>> Yeah,


your
 summit
 is
 is
 is
 is
 pretty
 fun.


>> We
 had
 a
 great
 time
 recounting
 uh
 SNL


sketches
 that
 didn't
 didn't
 make
 it.


>> Oh
 god,
 there's
 so
 many
 good
 ones.


I
 mean,
 we
 didn't
 even
 get
 to
 the


Jeopardy
 ones.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Those
 are
 so
 offensive.
 Oh,
 wait.
 Do
 you


know?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 we
 skipped
 a
 few
 that


would
 have
 um
 dramatically
 increased
 our


probability
 of
 being
 killed.


>> You
 can
 take
 this
 one
 out,


>> boys.
 I
 love
 you.
 I
 love
 you.
 I
 love
 you


all.
 I'm
 going
 to
 poker


>> later.


>> Take
 care.


>> Byebye.


>> Love
 you.


>> We'll
 let
 your
 winners
 ride.


>> Rainman
 David.


>> We
 open
 sourced
 it
 to
 the
 fans
 and


they've
 just
 gone
 crazy
 with
 it.
 Love


you.
 Queen
 of
 Kino.


[Music]


>> Besties
 are
 gone.


>> That
 is
 my
 dog
 taking
 a
 notice
 in
 your


driveways.


>> Oh
 man,
 my
 habitasher
 will
 meet
 me
 up.


>> We
 should
 all
 just
 get
 a
 room
 and
 just


have
 one
 big
 huge
 orgy
 cuz
 they're
 all


just
 useless.
 It's
 like
 this
 like
 sexual


tension
 that
 we
 just
 need
 to
 release


somehow.


Wet
 your
 feet.


>> Your
 feet.


>> We
 need
 to
 get
 mer.


[Music]


I'm
 going
 all
 in.
