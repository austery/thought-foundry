- Glass is inherently brittle.
(glass smashing)
It is the very symbol
we use for fragility.
But these days, we expect
so much from this material.
We want it to be perfectly transparent,
scratch resistant,
thin, and even flexible.
But most of all, we want it not to break.
So is it possible to
make unbreakable glass?
Well, in this video, I will make the case
that glass is one of the
most important materials
humans have ever made.
It has transformed how we live,
launched numerous scientific revolutions,
and forever altered how we think
about our place in the universe.
Part of this video was sponsored by Saily.
In mid 2006, Steve Jobs had a problem.
Apple was working on the first iPhone,
set to be released in January 2007.
But Jobs wasn't satisfied with the screen.
The prototypes he was
testing had plastic screens,
which scratched easily.
So Jobs wanted glass, but
regular glass wouldn't work.
It too would get scratched
up and it would also shatter.
Plus, he wanted the phone to be slick,
so the glass had to be really thin.
So he called up the CEO
of Corning, Wendell Weeks,
to ask him to make the glass for Apple.
And six months later, it
was on the first iPhone.
This was Gorilla Glass.
Gorilla Glass has been
used in phones, computers,
and wearable devices
for the last 17 years.
Now it's used on billions of devices,
and over the years it's
become a lot more durable.
So we sent Veritasium producer, Petr,
to Corning's headquarters,
to see for ourselves how
Gorilla Glass is made
and how it works.
- We'll need a volunteer.
- [Petr] Yeah, guess that's me.
- [Demonstrator] All right,
so this is what we call
our key scratch demo.
In here we have a polycarbonate,
which is basically a plastic,
and then we have the Gorilla Glass.
And what you can do is
scratch this side first,
the polycarbonate, see how it goes.
- [Petr] Yep, definitely scratches.
- Yep.
- Try to scratch in our logo.
Not quite.
- There you go.
- [Petr] Are we getting it?
Veritasium.
- [Camera Operator] Yes.
- [Petr] All right.
- [Demonstrator] So now try the same thing
on the other side.
So this is Gorilla Glass.
- [Petr] Yeah, definitely
does not scratch.
- [Narrator] To break
glass requires two things,
a flaw and stress.
To introduce the flaw,
they sandblasted a spot
in the middle of the glass
to roughen up its surface.
And Petr will apply the stress.
- [Demonstrator] Take that tip
and put it inside that circle
and push down.
See if you can break it apart.
Not too hard, right?
- [Petr] No.
- [Demonstrator] All
right, so next we have
strengthened soda lime.
Strengthened as much as
you can for soda lime.
So, all right.
(glass cracking)
- [Petr] Harder, for sure.
- Harder, a little bit?
Next we have Gorilla Glass.
- [Petr] I'm kind of terrified.
Oh, Man.
(laughing) I know like we
don't actually want to do this,
but I want to do this.
So.
(Petr grunting)
Are you kidding me?
- There's two responses.
The first response is either,
"This is a really great demo,
I completely understand
what you're showing me."
The second response is,
'I'm taking this personally,
and I need to try to break this glass."
- Okay.
It is a very good demo.
I'm like genuinely really
impressed at this point.
I still want to break the glass.
Right, last one.
No.
Like, I'm bending the stylus.
Okay, amazing
- Glass has existed in
nature for billions of years.
It's formed by meteorite impacts,
lightning strikes and volcanic eruptions.
But when humans came along,
they found ways to use glass.
Obsidian is volcanic glass.
It forms when lava cools quickly.
It's extremely brittle,
so when you hit it with another rock,
you can chip off sections of it
to make a sharper and sharper edge.
There's evidence of obsidian being used
for cutting implements,
arrowheads and tips of spears,
as early as 1.2 million years ago.
And it hasn't gone out of fashion.
Today, some surgical
scalpels have their tips
sharpened to just three nanometers across,
and the best material for
this purpose is obsidian.
Compared to the million plus
years we've been using glass,
we only started making it very recently,
around 5,600 years ago.
Most common glass is composed
mainly of oxygen and silicon.
The two most abundant
elements in Earth's crust.
In nature, you find them
in the form of quartz,
crystalline silicon dioxide.
Crystalline means that
the atoms are arranged
in a regular repeating structure,
and quartz is the primary
constituent of sand.
So if you take some sand,
heat it up to about 1700
degrees Celsius until it melts,
and then rapidly cool it, it forms glass.
During the rapid cooling process,
the atoms don't have enough time
to return to their periodically
arranged crystal structure.
So instead they are stuck where they are,
like a liquid that's been
flash frozen in place.
That is why glass is
considered an amorphous solid.
Amorphous just means disorganized,
not in any regular arrangement.
But perhaps this is where
the misconception about glass
being a liquid comes from.
It isn't a liquid at room temperature.
Glass is solid because the
atoms are fixed in place.
They can't flow past each
other like in a liquid.
I even made a video about
this nine years ago.
They are disordered, but they are solid.
This amorphous structure is
also what makes glass so brittle
because there's no way for the
structure to relieve stress.
When stress is applied to the glass
a small crack will form
at a flaw on the surface.
And as the glass cracks,
the stress is applied to
atoms with fewer neighbors.
So the crack grows bigger,
which eventually leads
to the glass fracturing.
- [Demonstrator] So next
we'll move to what we call
the slapper demos.
What we're using is sandpaper.
This represents like an
asphalt type surface.
- Sure.
- So if you were to get outta your car
and you accidentally drop
your phone in the parking lot.
And what we're using is this fixture.
It's bending it.
- Mm hm.
- So it's pre-stressing it.
You have our rough surface
to introduce the flaw.
And on here we have an alternative glass.
Similar to some of the competitive stuff,
different things on the market.
And when you're ready, you can drop.
- On three, two, one.
(glass clanging)
Some sounds.
Okay.
- Right.
- So it broke.
- Not what you wanna see
when you pick up your
phone off the parking lot.
- [Petr] No.
Heartbreak.
- And then we have the Gorilla Glass
and what we call the mega slap.
All right, very exciting name, right?
Now you can see me dramatically
increase the height.
- Shall I do it from here?
- Nope, from...
- The very top?
- From the very top.
- Okay.
So, we're not just increasing the height,
we're also starting from way up here.
- Right.
- All right.
Three, two, one.
(metal clanging)
No, we're good.
That's pretty cool.
(gentle music)
- While, the basic recipe for glass
involves silicon dioxide,
glass makers have been
adding other ingredients
to change its properties
for thousands of years.
Adding sodium carbonate,
also known as soda,
and calcium oxide, also known as lime,
lowers the temperature at
which it becomes liquid
from 1700 degrees Celsius
to around a thousand degrees Celsius.
And that's why soda lime
glass accounts for around 90%
of all glass manufactured today.
Another recipe includes adding
boron trioxide to the mixture,
forming a borosilicate glass.
Glass is usually quite sensitive
to changes in temperature.
If you throw boiling water
on your car's windshield,
it'll likely shatter due to
the glass rapidly expanding.
But borosilicate glass
has a really low coefficient
of thermal expansion.
It doesn't grow or shrink very much,
even with drastic temperature changes.
So it's often used for
laboratory glass, like beakers.
- [Group Member] Let's go.
(bystander laughing)
- If you want to grab a pair
of these screen glasses too?
- [Petr] Yeah.
- [Camera Operator] Oh yeah.
- I can't see anything.
- [Narrator] And while
this specific recipe
for Gorilla Glass is secret,
it is based on a combination of silicon,
aluminum, magnesium, and sodium.
And the recipe keeps changing.
The scientists are constantly
trying different formulations
to find more durable and
scratch resistant glasses here.
- This is so cool.
Do you ever feel like a pizza chef?
(group indistinct chattering)
(Petr laughing)
(group indistinct chattering)
(light upbeat music)
- [Narrator] This facility
is actually where that
experimentation takes place.
(light music)
The earliest human made
glass was likely an accident.
People have been working
metal for thousands of years
before they made glass.
So it's thought that
some sand made its way
into metal working furnaces,
forming small glass beads.
But soon glass making
became its own art form,
to make decorations, ornaments, statues,
tableware and containers.
Unlike clay, glass is
impermeable to water,
making it an ideal material
for bowls and bottles.
But then glass makers noticed
that by adding other
elements into the mix,
they could change the color of the glass.
By adding cobalt oxide,
you would get a vivid blue.
Adding cuprite makes red.
But all of the historical
glasses we've been talking about
have been opaque.
Which is not really what
we think of as glass today.
After glass making was invented,
thousands of years passed before
we invented transparent glass.
That's because making it is
actually pretty difficult.
(light bright music)
The first step came around a hundred AD,
when glass makers in Alexandria
added manganese dioxide into the mixture,
which led to a semi opaque glass.
It definitely wasn't transparent,
but it did let some light through.
This is when glass began
being used for windows.
And glass windows were a huge deal.
I mean, they provide a physical barrier
that keeps the warm air in
and the wind and critters out,
while still allowing light
to shine into your home.
But the first truly transparent glass
was made many centuries later,
around the Italian city of Venice.
The art of glass making was thriving
and bringing a lot of money into the city.
(cash register dinging)
There was just one problem.
To make and manipulate glass
you need very hot furnaces.
And at the time, Venice was a city
built almost entirely out of wood.
So yeah, glass makers were bringing
a lot of money into the city,
but they also kept
accidentally burning it down.
So in 1291, the government
of Venice had had enough,
so they moved all the glass
makers to the island of Murano.
The island became known
as the Isle of Glass,
celebrated for making the most beautiful
and intricate glassware anywhere on earth.
This is also where the glass
maker, Angelo Barovier,
invented clear glass.
He took some seaweed rich in
potassium oxide and manganese
and burned it to create ash.
Then he added this ash into his glass.
And when it cooled, he found
that the glass was transparent.
Most materials are opaque
because when photons hit them,
the photons are absorbed.
The photon excites an electron,
pushing it up to a higher energy level.
But this only happens
when the photons energy
matches the energy of an
allowed electron transition.
And different materials have
different energy levels.
In transparent glass,
the energy required to move an electron
from a lower state to a higher state
is higher than the amount of energy
that a photon of visible light has.
So the photon just passes right through.
Now, while glass is
transparent to visible light,
it does interact with other parts
of the electromagnetic spectrum.
It absorbs much of the
ultraviolet spectrum,
because UV photons have more energy.
Hence, they can push the electron
to the higher energy level
and be absorbed.
That makes it opaque to UV.
This is also how colored glass is made.
You add impurities into the glass,
which affects the electron energy levels,
which then changes the color of the glass.
If you look at a pane of glass side on,
you might notice that
it looks slightly green,
which is because the most
common glass used for windows,
soda lime, has impurities of iron oxides,
which give the glass a green tinge.
The glass absorbs more of the other colors
than it does green.
So that's why we see it.
I think the only way we truly appreciate
how important transparent glass is
would be if all of a
sudden it disappeared.
So your windows, glasses,
screens all gone.
But there is another
element in our daily lives
that we take for granted,
which is connectivity.
I mean, we are always
connected to the internet,
and losing that connection,
even for a few minutes, can
be pretty uncomfortable,
especially when you are traveling.
Staying connected abroad requires
either paying exorbitant roaming fees,
or a continuous hunt for public wifi.
But luckily, you can avoid all
of this with today's sponsor,

And now back to transparent glass.
(light upbeat music)
Truly transparent glass was a massive deal
for three reasons.
Sometime in the early
1300s, in northern Italy,
this clear glass was
ground, shaped and polished
into small discs
that were thicker in the
center than at the edges.
Due to their resemblance to lentil beans,
they became known as lenses.
Glasses to correct farsightedness
didn't seem all that
important at the time,
because literacy rates were so low,
they were almost
exclusively used by monks.
But after the invention of the
printing press, circa 1440,
glasses became a vital tool.
The printing press led
to a precipitous drop
in the cost of producing books,
which led to a rapid
increase in literacy rates.
Now a large number of people became aware
that they were farsighted.
Thankfully, there was
a technology available
to solve the problem.
150 years later, a father and son,
Hans and Zacharias Janssen,
put two lenses in line with each other,
rather than side by side.
And this was likely the
world's first microscope.
It made objects appear about
20 times their original size.
In the 1660s,
Antony Van Leeuwenhoek made
significant improvements
on the microscope, by
grinding the lenses himself.
He could magnify things 200 times,
allowing him to see human cells.
A few years later, Robert
Hook published "Micrographia,"
a book full of beautiful sketches
of the microscopic world.
And all of this was possible
because of transparent glass.
And in 1608, Hans Lippershey,
an eyeglass maker,
applied for a patent for a spy glass.
His idea was for it to be used in warfare
to spy on your enemy on the battlefield.
The next year, Galileo
Galilei heard about his idea
and realized that he could
point this device toward the sky
to study the stars and planets.
Galileo's telescope magnified
objects in the night sky
by about 30 times.
In 1610, he was able to see
he craters of the moon in
detail, the phases of Venus,
and four of Jupiter's largest moons.
These observations were the
final nail in the coffin
for the geocentric model of the universe.
He saw moons that were clearly
revolving around Jupiter
and not the earth.
And how else could you
explain the phases of Venus,
other than to say that the
planet must go around the sun?
None of this would've been discovered
without the invention
of transparent glass.
Four centuries later,
we can now make glass
that is orders of magnitude
more transparent than water.
Glass that is so transparent,
that if you were able to make a column
as deep as the Mariana trench,
you'll be able to see all
the way to the bottom.
This is the glass inside optical fibers.
- Oh, this is getting real.
I'm stoked.
(camera operator laughing)
- [Narrator] But the
main thing we all need
is durable glass.
So how do you take a substance
that is typically delicate and brittle
and improve its scratch
resistance and drop resistance?
First you start with an
aluminosilicate base,
and then after the glass is made,
you submerge it in a
potassium salt solution
at 420 degrees Celsius.
- [Petr] It really does look like water.
- [Camera Operator] Doesn't it?
- Yeah.
I don't know if I want to drink it.
- [Narrator] Potassium and sodium
are chemically very similar.
I mean, they both have one
electron in their outer shell.
So during this process,
some of the sodium atoms are
replaced by potassium atoms
in the glass.
Now, potassium atoms are physically larger
than sodium atoms,
but the glass is already set.
It's rigid, so it
doesn't increase in size.
So now there's the larger potassium atoms
all squeezed together,
taking up the same amount
of space as before.
This increases the compressive strength
in the surface of the glass,
which makes it more durable.
- [Camera Operator] Can you
see any visual difference
of size between them?
- Honestly, no.
I have two pieces of glass.
One of them has gone through
the ion exchange process.
The other one hasn't.
I don't know which one is which.
And we're gonna figure
that out really soon.
You guys ready?
Three, two, one.
(glass shattering)
Okay.
(camera operator laughing)
That was really cool.
(glass clanging)
Shall I hit it harder?
- Yeah.
(glass clanging)
- Yeah, that was a thunk.
My mind is genuinely blown.
That's really cool.
That's all just like ion exchange, right?
That's all just...
There's no other difference, right?
- Yeah.
- You put it in
a bunch of salt.
- Yep, for a few hours,
and voila.
- For a few hours.
- Yep.
- Ah.
- I'm trying to think of
a good analogy for this.
You know, I can imagine
if there were just a whole bunch of people
sort of standing around casually
and you try to run through them,
you'd probably be able to
bounce through a few of them,
break through the crowd.
But what if instead,
all of those people
were squeezed together,
shoulder to shoulder, you know,
like people trying to get
into a subway or something.
If you try to run through them,
all of those forces are just
gonna add up and prevent you
from getting in or from
making a dent, making a crack,
anything like that.
(light groovy music)
But the scientists at Corning
are constantly trying
to refine the process,
to make the glass even more durable.
There is a whole team at the facility
that is dedicated to testing and measuring
different glass prototypes.
- [Petr] Alright, we're displacing it
by one and a half millimeters.
- Yep.
- [Petr] Two millimeters.
(glass cracking)
Well.
- [Narrator] And they really
put glass through its paces.
Conducting bending
tests, scratching tests,
and dropping heavy steel
balls onto the glass.
- [Demonstrator] Three, two, one.
(metal clanging)
- [Narrator] They also have replica phones
with different glasses for the screen.
And they drop them from
ever increasing heights.
- But we can go up a little bit
and maybe-
- Right.
- We can imagine that I'm taking a selfie.
- [Narrator] All of this is to make
the next version of Gorilla
Glass even more durable
than it already is.
- Like, are we doing this?
- If you want to.
- Hell yeah.
(machine whirring)
1.7 meters.
- That's roughly selfie height.
Three, two, one.
(glass clanging)
- Amazing.
- Go down and pick that up.
- Still good.
- Still survived.
- [Petr] Dude, that's pretty wild.
- You know, I think it's rather ironic,
that we are making this video right now,
while my phone looks like this.
Can you see those?
Yeah.
So, it's still glass, it's still cracks.
It is not perfect yet.
But it is constantly improving,
because scientists are working on ways
to make this material
more and more durable.
And we have come such a long way.
I am just appreciative that
I can have this material.
And it is amazing,
even if it does still crack sometimes,
with people who just refuse
to get a case for their phone.
(electronic device whirring)
