Fang
 or
 Mang
 jobs
 are
 still
 the
 crown


jewel
 of
 tech
 careers,
 the
 gold


standard,
 the
 dream.
 Or
 is
 it?
 Let's


look
 closely
 exactly
 what
 you're


dreaming
 of
 because
 the
 fantasy
 of


working
 at
 Google
 or
 Meta
 looks
 very


different
 from
 the
 day-to-day
 reality.


And
 also,
 let's
 look
 whether
 it's
 even


possible
 to
 get
 it
 at
 this
 point
 because


I'm
 sure
 many
 of
 you
 have
 tried
 tens
 of


times,
 paid
 for
 coaches,
 for
 interview


prep,
 but
 that
 led
 you
 nowhere.
 Here
 is


what
 we'll
 cover
 today.
 What
 people


really
 do
 at
 Fang
 in
 2025,
 the
 pros
 and


cons
 of
 getting
 into
 Fang
 as
 an
 early


grad
 or
 early
 career
 professional,
 myths


about
 Fang
 quality
 talent,
 and
 whether


it's
 feasible
 to
 get
 into
 fang
 in
 2025.


This
 video
 series
 is
 for
 tech


professionals
 already
 living
 and
 working


in
 the
 US,
 Canada,
 the
 UK,
 or
 the


European
 Union.
 If
 you're
 based
 outside


these
 regions
 or
 in
 an
 outsourcing
 heavy


market,
 the
 data
 in
 this
 video
 will
 not


apply
 to
 your
 situation.
 I
 do
 not
 cover


immigration,
 international
 job
 hunting,


or
 topics
 like
 how
 to
 break
 into
 tech


without
 a
 college
 degree.
 If
 that's
 what


you're
 here
 for,
 this
 probably
 isn't
 the


right
 channel,
 and
 that's
 okay.
 But
 if


you
 are
 operating
 within
 these
 markets,


keep
 watching.
 There's
 a
 lot
 ahead
 for


various
 seniority
 levels
 and
 career


tracks
 in
 tech.
 Starting
 with
 what


people
 really
 do
 at
 Fang.
 Fang
 is
 often


presented
 as
 the
 best
 companies
 for
 tech


talent,
 where
 you'd
 be
 doing
 the
 most


interesting
 work
 and
 intellectually


stimulating
 work
 and
 getting
 your
 hands


on
 the
 technology
 that
 becomes


best-in-class
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world.


Fang
 was
 the
 first
 to
 introduce
 those


crazy
 hard
 multi-step
 interviews
 that
 so


many
 career
 coaches
 build
 businesses


upon,
 teaching
 others
 how
 to
 get
 through


those
 interviews.
 Those
 interviews
 have


driven
 enough
 people
 to
 the
 point
 of


self-destruction
 after
 they
 have
 been


refused
 a
 job
 after
 4
 months
 of
 hardcore


interviews.
 I've
 been
 wanting
 to
 film


this
 video
 for
 a
 long
 time
 as
 I
 myself


have
 tried
 getting
 into
 a
 fang
 for
 years


and
 never
 succeeded.
 The
 number
 of
 times


I
 have
 been
 referred
 is
 probably
 close


to
 100.
 And
 sometimes
 I
 had
 stronger


referrals
 that
 took
 my
 resumes
 to
 the


hiring
 managers.
 The
 hiring
 manager


would
 look
 and
 say,
 "This
 is
 a
 very


strong
 resume,
 an
 excellent
 experience.


We
 will
 definitely
 give
 her
 a
 call."
 And


nothing.
 I
 still
 don't
 know
 if
 I'd
 be


able
 to
 pass
 the
 interview
 because
 I've


never
 even
 gotten
 to
 the
 first
 round.


Now,
 cue
 the
 comments.
 You're
 just


bitter
 because
 you
 didn't
 make
 it.
 Sure,


let
 me
 save
 you
 the
 trouble.
 Go
 ahead


and
 drop
 that
 one
 below.
 I'll
 wait.


Everybody
 knows
 experience
 at
 Fang
 is


cool,
 but
 how
 much
 do
 we
 really
 know


what
 people
 do
 there?
 Let's
 take
 Google


as
 an
 example.
 Although
 everything
 I


will
 be
 saying
 applies
 to
 all
 of
 the


fang
 companies,
 Google
 makes
 most
 of


their
 technology
 in-house
 because
 it


works
 better
 for
 them
 and
 they
 want
 to


sell
 it
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 and


that's
 the
 core
 of
 their
 business
 model.


Amazon
 does
 the
 same.
 I
 want
 to


emphasize
 that
 the
 beauty
 of
 fang
 jobs


is
 that
 they
 build
 their
 own
 technology.


So
 as
 an
 employee,
 you
 get
 your
 hands
 on


building
 the
 building
 blocks
 versus
 apps


or
 products
 that
 are
 based
 on
 those


building
 blocks.
 That
 is
 rare.
 That's


what's
 really
 attractive
 about
 Fang.


Google
 search,
 Google
 Analytics,
 Google


Cloud
 Wallets.
 Google
 has
 multiple


product
 verticals
 serving
 both
 B2B
 and


B2C
 ecosystems.
 It's
 a
 gigantic
 company


with
 employees
 supporting
 all
 of
 those


products.
 and
 they
 have
 reached
 the


company
 size
 of
 180,000
 employees.
 You


can
 probably
 guess
 that
 if
 you
 happen
 to


land
 a
 job
 there,
 chances
 are
 the
 work


you're
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 will
 be
 focused


on
 supporting
 some
 of
 those
 products.


And
 there
 is
 zero
 guarantee
 that
 you


will
 be
 put
 on
 something
 really
 cool
 and


exciting
 and
 not
 Gmail
 maintenance
 or


some
 Android
 maintenance
 feature.
 Now,


there
 are
 highstakes,
 high-budget


projects
 like
 Google
 Quantum
 and
 the


Willow
 Chip.
 But
 let's
 be
 real,
 those


teams
 are
 staffed
 by
 researchers
 and


PhDs,
 not
 just
 machine
 learning


engineers,
 but
 actual
 AI
 scientists.
 I


personally
 would
 love
 to
 work
 on
 a


quantum
 product.
 I'm
 not
 a
 physicist,


but
 I
 studied
 chemistry
 at
 uni,
 and
 I've


always
 been
 drawn
 to
 science-driven


tech.
 I've
 applied
 to
 a
 few
 quantum
 PM


roles,
 even
 landed
 interviews,
 but
 in


every
 case
 I
 was
 told
 you
 need
 a
 physics


background.
 And
 to
 that,
 I'd
 say,
 look,


you're
 asking
 for
 a
 highly
 improbable


combination.
 You're
 asking
 for
 a


seasoned
 PM
 with
 years
 in
 SAS
 who


happens
 to
 have
 a
 degree
 in
 quantum


physics.
 I
 am
 close.
 I've
 got
 the


experience,
 and
 I
 studied
 chemistry,


which
 isn't
 physics,
 but
 it's
 not
 too


far.
 And
 I'm
 more
 than
 willing
 to
 learn


the
 basics
 of
 quantum
 physics
 if
 it's


required
 for
 the
 job
 because
 I
 really


like
 that
 stuff.
 Still
 a
 no.
 Why
 am
 I


saying
 all
 of
 this?
 Because
 when
 you
 see


that
 somebody
 works
 at
 Fang,
 don't
 be


like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 they
 must
 be
 a


genius."
 They're
 not
 the
 scrappy
 labs


they
 used
 to
 be
 in
 2000s
 or
 2010s.
 And


while
 they
 absolutely
 built
 some
 of
 the


world's
 most
 powerful
 infrastructure,


the
 reality
 is
 many
 roles
 focus
 on


maintaining
 and
 scaling
 existing


systems,
 not
 launching
 the
 next


moonshot.
 That
 doesn't
 make
 the
 work


easy,
 but
 it's
 often
 incremental,


boring,
 and
 low
 impact.
 And
 let's
 be


honest,
 nobody
 wants
 to
 admit
 that
 they


spend
 their
 days
 tuning
 dashboards
 or


triaging
 permission
 bugs
 in
 Gmail.
 With


a
 logo
 like
 that
 on
 the
 resume,
 the


expectation
 is
 that
 you're
 changing
 the


world.
 So
 the
 ego
 plays
 a
 huge
 role
 too.


Now
 onto
 the
 pros
 and
 cons
 of
 getting


into
 fang
 as
 an
 early
 grad.
 If
 you're


getting
 into
 fang
 early
 in
 your
 career


and
 years
 later
 fang
 is
 all
 you
 know,


you're
 signing
 up
 for
 quite
 a
 limited


skill
 set
 because
 everything
 you
 know
 is


tied
 to
 the
 company
 you
 worked
 for


because
 your
 company
 is
 the
 one


developing
 the
 technology
 that
 you're


using.
 You
 have
 no
 idea
 what's
 happening


in
 the
 outside
 world.
 This
 is
 the
 number


one
 reason
 why
 people
 voluntarily
 leave


Google
 or
 companies
 like
 Google
 given


they
 weren't
 poached.
 And
 this
 is
 also


the
 biggest
 risk
 to
 those
 who
 get
 laid


off.
 Sure,
 your
 market
 value
 goes
 up


because
 of
 those
 logos,
 but
 the
 skill


set
 is
 objectively
 limited.
 Another


thing,
 when
 you
 join
 such
 a
 massive
 org


since
 the
 early
 days
 of
 your
 career,
 and


it's
 not
 just
 fang,
 this
 applies
 to
 any


large
 corp,
 you
 will
 inevitably
 face
 the


following
 situation.
 You
 will
 have
 tens


of
 people
 on
 your
 team
 doing
 very


specific
 tasks.
 You
 will
 have
 tens
 of


supporting
 teams.
 So
 let's
 take
 my
 case


as
 product
 management.
 As
 a
 PM
 at
 a


massive
 org,
 I
 have
 business
 analysts,


product
 owners,
 project
 managers,


product
 ops,
 product
 analysts,
 all
 doing


supporting
 work
 to
 help
 me
 release
 a


product.
 My
 scope
 of
 work
 and
 my
 impact


is
 very
 small
 by
 definition.
 And
 on
 one


hand
 you
 may
 argue
 well
 if
 all
 those


people
 are
 doing
 the
 tactical
 work
 for


you
 you
 can
 concentrate
 on
 efforts
 doing


really
 difficult
 product
 work
 like


figuring
 out
 what
 to
 build
 or
 how
 the


product
 will
 fit
 into
 your
 product


ecosystem
 or
 which
 markets
 to
 break
 into


how
 to
 expand
 product
 verticals
 things


like
 that.
 And
 to
 that
 I'll
 say
 well
 not


really
 because
 you
 have
 levels
 over


levels
 of
 management
 above
 you
 and


you're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the
 one
 making


those
 decisions.
 All
 of
 that
 stuff
 will


come
 top
 down.
 Let's
 be
 real.
 So,
 you


don't
 get
 to
 experience
 what
 it's
 like


to
 have
 a
 big
 impact.
 You
 don't
 ever
 get


to
 share
 the
 same
 level
 of


responsibility
 that
 someone
 who
 doesn't


have
 all
 of
 those
 supporting
 teams.
 You


get
 used
 to
 doing
 work
 only
 when
 you


have
 100
 people
 supporting
 you.
 And
 god


forbid
 they
 put
 you
 on
 a
 smaller
 team
 or


at
 a
 smaller
 company
 where
 you
 don't


have
 those
 functions
 simply
 because


there
 is
 no
 budget.
 You're
 going
 to
 be


very
 lost.
 So
 in
 my
 humble
 opinion,
 Fang


is
 really
 worth
 it
 when
 you
 are


midcareer
 and
 you
 have
 seen
 your
 job
 at


different
 stages
 of
 the
 company
 size


spectrum.
 Fang
 is
 no
 longer
 at
 a
 stage


where
 everything
 they
 do
 becomes
 a


pioneer
 in
 the
 world
 of
 tech.
 They're


very
 mature
 and
 very
 big
 for
 that
 kind


of
 stuff.
 Now
 there
 is
 only
 a
 small


fraction
 of
 people
 doing
 some
 really


worldchanging
 stuff.
 But
 all
 the


stereotypes
 you've
 heard
 about
 fang


people
 being
 exceptionally
 smart
 and


exceptionally
 talented,
 every
 single
 one


of
 them
 is
 quite
 dated
 at
 this
 point.


Cutting
 edge
 innovation
 you're
 thinking


about
 is
 often
 done
 at
 very
 promising


and
 hyperrowing
 startups
 and
 unicorns


these
 days.
 Now
 salaries,
 sure,
 if
 you


get
 in,
 you
 will
 be
 making
 more
 money


than
 pretty
 much
 anyone
 else
 of
 the
 same


skill
 level,
 but
 working
 for
 a
 smaller


company
 simply
 because
 Fang
 does
 pay


very
 well.
 There's
 no
 doubt
 about
 it.
 A


large
 percentage
 of
 their
 comp
 is
 RSUs


and
 their
 stocks
 go
 up
 in
 price.
 But


will
 you
 be
 making
 millions?
 Probably


not.
 On
 to
 the
 myths
 about
 Fang
 quality


talent.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 say
 that
 working


at
 Fang
 often
 means
 that
 you're
 going
 to


be
 working
 with
 the
 brightest
 minds
 on


the
 planet.
 It
 is
 true.
 Fang
 is
 full
 of


people
 that
 are
 truly
 bright
 and
 can


build
 mindblowing
 things.
 But
 is


everybody
 like
 that?
 In
 my
 experience,
 I


have
 seen
 people
 who
 were
 mediocre
 at


best
 when
 we
 worked
 together
 and
 then


they
 would
 put
 in
 the
 twoe
 notice
 and


two
 weeks
 later
 their
 company
 changes
 to


one
 of
 the
 fang
 logos.
 So,
 on
 one
 hand,


you're
 like,
 "Wow,
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 you


pulled
 that
 off,
 but
 good
 for
 you.
 Well,


I
 wasn't
 able
 to
 do
 that."
 But
 then
 a


month
 after
 they're
 gone,
 turns
 out
 that


the
 amount
 of
 mistakes
 that
 they
 left


after
 themselves,
 the
 amount
 of
 broken


stuff
 that
 they
 left
 in
 the
 code
 and
 the


amount
 of
 mess
 that
 they
 left
 for


everyone
 else
 to
 fix
 post
 their


departure
 is
 just,
 let's
 just
 say
 it's


not
 the
 kind
 of
 stuff
 that
 you
 expect


from
 someone
 who
 got
 accepted
 into
 Fang.


So
 what
 does
 that
 tell
 you?
 You
 can
 get


really
 good
 at
 the
 interview
 prep.
 If


you're
 a
 PM,
 you
 can
 go
 through
 hundreds


or
 thousands
 of
 product
 cases
 or
 system


design
 questions.
 If
 you're
 a
 dev,
 you


can
 spend
 hundreds
 of
 hours
 lead
 coding.


And
 yes,
 you
 can
 objectively
 do
 very


well
 in
 an
 interview.
 But
 does
 that
 make


you
 exceptional
 at
 your
 job?
 To
 me,
 not


really.
 Because
 no
 matter
 how
 hard
 the


interview
 is,
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 them


follow
 a
 framework.
 And
 if
 you
 do
 them


for
 hundreds
 of
 hours
 over
 and
 over


again,
 you
 can
 get
 really
 good
 at


solving
 pretty
 much
 any
 interview


problem.
 Fang
 has
 grown
 up.
 There
 are
 so


many
 ex
 Googlers,
 ex
 meta,
 ex
 Netflix
 at


this
 point
 that
 they're
 not
 that
 rare


anymore.
 Those
 additions
 to
 your
 name
 on


LinkedIn
 after
 a
 comma
 were
 really
 sexy


5
 years
 ago,
 but
 now
 they're
 kind
 of


everywhere.
 The
 hardest
 thing
 about


getting
 into
 thank
 is
 the
 interviews


themselves.
 And
 while
 you
 can
 spend


months
 prepping
 for
 it
 and
 you
 can
 be


truly
 good
 at
 those
 interviews,
 you
 may


also
 come
 across
 an
 interviewer
 who's


just
 not
 feeling
 their
 best
 that
 day
 and


they
 simply
 don't
 like
 you.
 And
 that's


it.
 you're
 done.
 You're
 not
 going
 to
 get


the
 job.
 Does
 that
 make
 you
 stupid?
 Hell


no.
 Sure,
 Fang
 has
 excellent
 talent,
 but


so
 do
 other
 companies
 ranging
 from
 small


startups
 all
 the
 way
 to
 tier
 one.
 In


fact,
 some
 of
 the
 brightest
 and
 most


hardworking
 PMs
 and
 engineers
 that
 I've


ever
 worked
 with
 were
 startup
 talent,


not
 Fang.
 Another
 story
 from
 personal


experience,
 and
 this
 was
 years
 back,
 it


was
 announced
 that
 we
 hired
 a
 Fang
 PM.


And
 all
 PMs
 on
 my
 team
 were
 like,
 "Okay


guys,
 let's
 pack
 our
 bags.
 This
 person


will
 rip
 us
 apart."
 Because
 none
 of
 us


at
 the
 time
 were
 from
 any
 sort
 of
 big


company.
 We
 were
 all
 busting
 our
 asses


to
 make
 it
 in
 the
 hyper
 competitive
 tech


building
 a
 killer
 product
 with
 the
 most


minimal
 resources.
 And
 the
 product
 was


doing
 really
 really
 well
 for
 its
 niche.


But
 all
 of
 us
 were
 so
 insecure
 about


ourselves
 with
 this
 new
 person
 coming


in.
 So
 long
 story
 short,
 they
 couldn't


write
 a
 single
 technical
 ticket
 without


assistance.
 They
 had
 no
 idea
 how
 to
 do


market
 research
 or
 competitive
 research.


They
 had
 no
 idea
 how
 to
 deal
 with


engineering.
 They
 had
 no
 idea
 how
 to


guide
 a
 designer.
 They
 were
 the
 nicest


person,
 but
 all
 of
 their
 prior


experience
 was
 Google,
 Meta,
 Pinterest,


Twitter,
 and
 Microsoft.
 And
 they
 always


had
 tens
 of
 supporting
 people
 doing
 this


work
 for
 them.
 Another
 thing
 that
 became


really
 obvious
 after
 the
 layoffs
 when


the
 talent
 pool
 became
 so
 big
 and


directors
 even
 at
 smaller
 companies
 now


have
 a
 choice
 between
 multiple


candidates,
 many
 of
 them
 coming
 from


Fang.
 What
 they
 often
 notice
 and
 what


I've
 seen
 on
 various
 Slack
 channels
 and


even
 on
 Reddit
 is
 that
 they
 say
 how
 when


they
 start
 interviewing
 people
 who
 come


from
 Fang
 and
 whose
 entire
 career
 is


well
 built
 at
 Fang,
 how
 they
 often
 do
 a


lot
 worse
 during
 interviews
 than
 someone


who
 comes
 from
 a
 startup
 environment.


not
 on
 these
 standard
 questions.
 How
 do


you
 build
 a
 new
 product
 for
 YouTube
 kind


of
 question,
 but
 when
 you
 ask
 very
 real


practical
 questions
 about
 the
 product


work
 that
 happens
 on
 a
 daily
 basis,


startup
 and
 scale
 up
 PMs
 often


outperform
 Fang.
 Now,
 is
 it
 feasible
 to


get
 into
 Fang
 if
 you're
 not
 coming
 from


a
 tier
 one
 logo?
 Who
 has
 the
 best
 shot?


People
 who
 went
 to
 universities
 that


have
 internship
 programs
 with
 Fang?
 So,


in
 Canada,
 it's
 usually
 the
 University


of
 Wateroo,
 sometimes
 uft.
 In
 the
 US,


it's
 Stanford,
 Harvard,
 Princeton,


Georgia
 Tech.
 That
 is
 the
 only
 real
 way


to
 get
 in
 early.
 Are
 you
 that
 bright
 and


that
 exceptional
 or
 that
 experienced
 at


23
 years
 of
 age,
 but
 they
 got
 to
 hire


someone
 to
 do
 the
 maintenance
 of
 all
 of


those
 products
 that
 they
 built.
 Number


two,
 your
 resume
 must
 be
 comprised
 of


tier
 one
 logos.
 Now,
 even
 if
 you
 weren't


that
 great
 of
 a
 PM
 or
 a
 data
 scientist,


but
 you
 happen
 to
 have
 Snap,
 Twitch,


Discord,
 Pinterest
 on
 the
 resume,
 you


will
 have
 a
 much
 higher
 chance
 simply


because
 you're
 coming
 from
 tier
 one.


Once
 you
 enter
 tier
 one,
 you
 start


jumping
 from
 one
 company
 to
 another.
 I


spoke
 about
 this
 in
 the
 video
 about


California.
 Tier
 one
 often
 feels
 like
 a


closed
 private
 old
 school
 club.
 You
 got


to
 get
 in
 to
 start
 making
 those
 moves.


Sometimes
 you're
 in
 because
 you're


really
 good.
 Sometimes
 you're
 in
 because


you
 were
 lucky
 to
 be
 in
 the
 right
 place


at
 the
 right
 time
 around
 the
 right


people.
 Number
 three,
 you
 have
 a
 very


niche
 expertise
 in
 a
 very
 specific


subject.
 For
 example,
 quantum
 physics


and
 quantum
 product
 development.
 There


simply
 isn't
 many
 people
 on
 the
 planet


who
 can
 demonstrate
 success
 in
 that


discipline.
 and
 they
 would
 be
 looking
 at


your
 academic
 research
 publications,
 at


the
 grants
 you've
 won,
 at
 all
 of
 the


academia
 achievements
 that
 you
 have


shown
 throughout
 your
 career.
 Now,
 cold


applying
 to
 FAGN
 without
 a
 referral
 has


less
 than.5%
 chance
 of
 being
 opened.
 But


even
 if
 you
 have
 a
 referral,
 like
 I
 told


you,
 I
 had
 plenty
 of
 referrals.
 I
 have


referrals
 who
 would
 quite
 literally
 take


my
 resume
 and
 put
 it
 on
 the
 director's


desk,
 that's
 still
 a
 very
 low
 chance.


When
 it
 comes
 to
 Fang,
 you
 either
 wait


to
 be
 head-h
 hunted
 or
 you
 got
 to
 have


connections
 on
 very
 senior
 levels
 that


have
 hiring
 power.
 But
 like
 I
 said,
 Fang


is
 no
 longer
 what
 it
 used
 to
 be
 20
 years


ago.
 Now
 it's
 a
 massive
 bureaucratic


machine.
 And
 I
 have
 personally
 spoken
 to


people
 who
 are
 at
 very
 senior
 levels
 and


can
 refer
 and
 can
 interview
 you
 if
 they


know
 you
 personally.
 But
 they
 would


often
 admit
 that
 listen,
 I
 have
 200


candidates
 that
 are
 internal
 that
 I
 must


interview
 before
 you.
 We
 can
 have
 beers.


We
 can
 have
 a
 great
 chat.
 I
 know
 you're


a
 great
 person,
 but
 I
 must
 interview
 the


following
 200
 people
 who
 have
 applied


internally.
 The
 company
 will
 not
 let
 me


hire
 you
 no
 matter
 how
 good
 you
 are.


That
 is
 the
 reality
 of
 Fang.
 So,
 even


with
 referrals,
 nothing
 is
 guaranteed.
 I


made
 a
 very
 detailed
 video
 talking
 about


how
 exactly
 referrals
 work
 at
 big


companies.
 It's
 a
 little
 long,
 but
 I
 was


trying
 to
 be
 as
 detailed
 as
 possible.


Now,
 who
 should
 not
 expect
 miracles?


Even
 if
 you
 are
 objectively
 very


skilled,
 but
 your
 resume
 is
 made
 up
 of


small
 logos,
 not
 going
 to
 happen.
 No


matter
 how
 good
 you
 are,
 the
 chances
 of


you
 making
 it
 are
 non-existent.
 If
 you


live
 outside
 a
 country
 where
 Fang
 has


offices
 now,
 despite
 the
 fact
 that
 Fang


definitely
 has
 budgets
 for
 relocation,


they've
 done
 it
 a
 lot
 and
 they
 do
 it


frequently,
 it
 is
 very
 hard
 to
 get


noticed
 by
 them.
 You
 either
 have
 to
 be


head-h
 hunted
 or
 you
 have
 to
 be
 noticed


by
 the
 people
 who
 have
 the
 hiring
 power


for
 your
 line
 of
 work.
 And
 that


visibility
 typically
 comes
 to
 you
 if


you're
 either
 building
 something
 that


gets
 a
 lot
 of
 attention
 at
 unicorns
 or


tier
 one
 companies
 or
 you
 work
 at
 a
 very


promising
 startup
 that
 is
 being
 sold
 to


a
 bigger
 company
 and
 the
 deal
 gets
 a
 lot


of
 attention
 on
 media.
 And
 you
 got
 to
 be


realistic.
 Anyone
 can
 apply.
 Hundreds
 of


thousands
 of
 people
 submit
 their
 resumes


on
 the
 websites.
 Hundreds
 of
 thousands


already
 have
 tier
 one
 and
 tier
 2
 logos


on
 the
 resume.
 You
 cannot
 be
 expecting


miracles
 even
 by
 sending
 hundreds
 of


applications.
 You
 have
 to
 look
 for
 the


unfair
 advantage
 and
 often
 times
 it


comes
 to
 you
 through
 your
 geographic


location.
 As
 I
 said
 before,
 I
 have
 been


working
 hard
 for
 years.
 I
 have
 never


chased
 titles
 over
 experiences.
 For


years,
 I
 would
 pick
 up
 jobs
 at
 the


companies
 where
 I
 knew
 I
 would
 have
 to


work
 around
 the
 clock
 to
 get
 that


product
 off
 the
 ground
 because
 I


thought,
 well,
 if
 I
 can
 do
 that,
 I'd
 be


unbeatable
 as
 a
 PM
 and
 Fang
 will
 all
 of


a
 sudden
 want
 me
 because,
 well,
 that


kind
 of
 skill
 set
 is
 hard
 to
 beat.
 And


in
 my
 9
 years
 of
 tech,
 I've
 been


grinding
 like
 a
 maniac
 to
 have
 top-notch


experience
 and
 top-notch
 education
 and


top-notch
 professional
 training.
 I've


invested
 so
 much
 of
 my
 time
 and
 money


into
 it.
 But
 what
 I
 did
 not
 do
 early
 on


is
 I
 did
 not
 invest
 in
 the
 right
 network


and
 in
 the
 right
 location
 because
 I
 did


not
 chase
 the
 logos.
 It
 probably
 made
 me


a
 strong
 PM
 because
 I
 have
 been
 through


some
 very
 rough
 scale
 up
 experiences.


But
 pivoting
 my
 resume
 from
 a
 scaleup
 PM


to
 at
 least
 a
 tier
 2
 company
 level
 PM


was
 very
 difficult.
 And
 all
 of
 that


happened
 while
 I
 watched
 some
 of
 my


university
 classmates
 the
 right
 contacts


and
 land
 internships
 at
 tier
 1.
 and
 then


two
 years
 later
 they're
 a
 PM
 at
 Meta
 and


I'd
 be
 looking
 like
 how
 did
 that
 happen


to
 land
 a
 job
 like
 that
 and
 the
 answer


is
 simple
 for
 some
 it's
 a
 combination
 of


the
 right
 contacts
 efforts
 invested
 in


the
 interview
 prep
 not
 mastering
 the


craft
 all
 I
 want
 to
 say
 is
 that
 if
 you


blew
 that
 interview
 or
 if
 you're
 like
 me


and
 never
 even
 got
 a
 chance
 at
 an


interview
 it's
 not
 because
 you're
 not


good
 enough
 the
 world
 doesn't
 end
 at


fang
 and
 you
 can
 land
 much
 better


compensations
 at
 promising
 scaleups
 I


hope
 this
 was
 helpful
 I
 would
 love
 to


hear
 your
 thoughts
 and
 feedback
 and


we'll
 see
 you
 next
 time.
 Bye.
