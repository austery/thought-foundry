Hey
 everybody,
 welcome
 back
 to
 the


channel.
 We
 are
 back
 on
 another
 episode


of
 the
 daily
 recap,
 episode
 number
 two,


after
 a
 fivemonth
 hiatus.
 I
 just
 want
 to


thank
 everyone
 who
 showed
 some
 support


on
 episode
 number
 one
 yesterday.
 Super


super
 grateful
 and
 happy
 that
 a
 lot
 of


people
 enjoy
 the
 format
 and
 we're
 going


to
 try
 to
 do
 it
 every
 single
 day,
 Monday


through
 Thursday,
 15
 20
 minutes
 and
 get


all
 the
 news
 that's
 important
 for
 the


stock
 market
 every
 single
 day
 so
 that


it's
 an
 easy
 way
 to
 consume
 it
 for


everybody.
 Got
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 to
 talk


about
 today.
 We
 got
 JPAL.
 We
 got
 trade


representative
 Jameson
 Greer.
 We
 had
 the


S&P
 500
 go
 down
 1.5%.
 We
 got
 a
 complete


reversal.
 We've
 got
 more
 news
 in
 AI.
 Lot


to
 talk
 about.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it.
 Okay,


so
 the
 first
 thing
 we'll
 talk
 about
 is


trade
 representative
 Jameson
 Greer.
 I


stayed
 extra
 long
 on
 my
 market
 open
 just


to
 be
 able
 to
 hear
 his
 comments
 because


I
 had
 a
 feeling
 and
 I
 think
 the
 entire


market
 had
 a
 feeling
 that
 whatever
 he


was
 going
 to
 say
 was
 going
 to
 matter.


Now,
 why
 does
 this
 matter?
 Well,
 this


morning
 if
 you
 looked
 at
 your
 portfolio,


in
 fact,
 I
 looked
 at
 mine
 at
 4:00
 a.m.


this
 morning
 and
 uh
 it
 was
 down
 a
 lot
 of


money.
 Let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 comments
 who


actually
 wakes
 up
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the


night
 and
 checks
 their
 portfolio.
 It's


such
 a
 stupid
 thing
 to
 do,
 but
 like
 we


all
 do
 it
 even
 though
 there's
 like


barely
 any
 volume
 and
 the
 pre-markets


don't
 always
 matter
 and
 nonetheless.
 And


then
 I
 ironically
 had
 some
 pretty
 bad


dreams
 after
 seeing
 how
 much
 money
 I
 was


down.
 But
 um
 look,
 in
 the
 morning
 it
 was


pretty
 bad.
 In
 the
 market
 open
 it
 was


pretty
 bad.
 And
 then
 Jameson
 Greer,
 who


is
 the
 trade
 representative
 for
 the


United
 States,
 he
 had
 some
 things
 to


say.
 Now
 what
 happened
 in
 the
 morning?


China
 basically
 came
 out
 with
 a


statement
 essentially,
 if
 you
 were
 to


paraphrase
 it,
 they
 continued
 to


escalate
 the
 problem
 with
 rare
 earth


metals.
 And
 we
 thought
 that
 issue
 was


dealt
 with
 on
 Sunday
 when
 Trump
 said,


"Hey,
 don't
 worry
 about
 China.
 Xi
 had
 a


bad
 moment.
 We're
 going
 to
 be
 okay."
 But


then
 based
 on
 what
 they
 said
 in
 the


morning,
 it
 felt
 like
 it
 was
 escalating.


Market
 was
 down
 1.5%.
 Then
 one
 of
 the


head
 representatives
 that
 negotiates


with
 China
 with
 Scapasent,
 he
 said
 these


following
 things.
 Number
 one,
 the
 United


States
 and
 China
 had
 staff
 level
 talks


in
 Washington
 today,
 aka
 they
 are


negotiating.
 There
 is
 an
 open
 line
 of


communication.
 Number
 two,
 everybody


needs
 rare
 earths.
 China
 knows
 this.


They
 are
 really
 hurting
 themselves
 by


acting
 like
 this.
 Number
 three,
 the


Chinese
 realize
 they
 overstepped,
 which


is
 why
 they
 pulled
 back
 some
 of
 their


statements
 over
 the
 weekend.
 Number


four,
 100%
 tariffs
 are
 still
 on
 the


table
 based
 on
 what
 China
 does
 next.
 And


number
 five,
 we
 always
 watch
 the
 stock


market
 and
 bond
 market.
 Want
 to
 make


sure
 the
 market
 responds
 to
 appropriate


info.
 By
 the
 way,
 that
 10-year
 Treasury


in
 the
 US
 bond
 market
 starting
 to
 come


down.
 It's
 at
 4.019.
 If
 that
 comes
 below


4%.
 That
 would
 not
 be
 the
 worst
 thing
 in


the
 world.
 So,
 why
 do
 the
 markets
 do
 an


entire
 U-turn?
 If
 you
 bought
 the
 dip


from
 around
 9:30
 a.m.
 Eastern
 to
 about


9:45,
 those
 were
 the
 15
 minutes
 where


you
 really
 had
 an
 opportunity
 where
 the


market
 kind
 of
 took
 a
 hit.
 Why
 did
 it
 do


a
 U-turn?
 Well,
 in
 my
 opinion,
 Jameson


Greer
 basically
 told
 the
 market,
 "We
 are


not
 trying
 to
 escalate
 the
 situation.
 We


did
 not
 initiate
 the
 escalation
 of
 the


situation.
 We
 want
 to
 work
 with
 China.


It's
 just
 we
 were
 dumbfounded
 last
 week


when
 we
 were
 getting
 all
 these
 notices


by
 other
 countries
 that
 are
 now
 being


threatened
 by
 China's
 new
 quote
 unquote


export
 controls.
 China
 says
 they're
 not


export
 controls.
 The
 United
 States
 says


they're
 obviously
 export
 controls
 and


that
 is
 hurting
 the
 supply
 chain
 and


flow
 of
 rare
 earth
 metals
 and
 minerals.


As
 a
 result,
 the
 markets
 basically
 were


like,
 "Okay,
 cool."
 So
 Trump
 is
 not


trying
 to
 start
 some
 crazy
 trade
 war.


Trump
 did
 not
 out
 of
 the
 blue
 say,
 "Hey,


let's
 like
 mess
 with
 China."
 which
 is


kind
 of
 the
 I
 guess
 the
 the
 the


perception
 the
 market
 had
 back
 in
 April


which
 is
 why
 markets
 took
 a
 30%
 draw


down
 and
 we
 had
 a
 3%
 draw
 down
 on
 Friday


because
 I
 think
 the
 markets
 were
 just


like
 dude
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 with
 deal


with
 this
 again
 with
 Trump
 starts
 random


trade
 wars
 I
 think
 Jameson
 Greer


basically
 came
 out
 and
 said
 it's
 not


really
 our
 fault
 we
 want
 to
 work
 with


the
 Chinese
 they
 want
 to
 work
 with
 us
 in


fact
 on
 Friday
 their
 foreign
 ministry
 or


on
 Saturday
 last
 week
 came
 out
 with
 a


bunch
 of
 statements
 trying
 to
 deescalate


and
 then
 JD
 Vance
 deescalated


deescalated
 Trump
 literally
 deescalated


but
 then
 this
 morning
 they
 escalated


again
 and
 we
 are
 trying
 to
 deescalate
 so


that
 doesn't
 mean
 there's
 a
 conclusion


on
 this
 China
 saga.
 But
 I
 think
 the


reason
 the
 markets
 literally
 went
 and


did
 a
 Vshape
 is
 because
 there
 is
 more


clarity
 on
 what's
 happening
 likely
 when


it's
 going
 to
 end,
 which
 you
 know
 Trump


and
 Xi
 they
 confirmed
 they're
 going to


be
 talking
 next
 week
 in
 South
 Korea
 and


so
 at
 the
 Apac
 meeting
 there
 likely
 is


going
 to
 be
 some
 level
 of
 communication


to
 be
 able
 to
 resolve
 this
 and
 if
 it


does
 that
 could
 be
 a
 tailwind
 for
 the


broader
 markets
 but
 I
 think
 we
 got
 some


clarity
 today
 even
 if
 we're
 not
 out
 of


the
 woods
 and
 as
 a
 result
 that's
 why
 the


markets
 were
 able
 to.
 All right,
 next


topic
 on
 the
 day
 JPAL.
 So,
 not
 only
 did


Jameson
 Greer
 say
 some
 things
 today,
 our


boy
 J
 Pal
 said
 a
 couple
 of
 things.
 And


let's
 just
 say
 he
 said
 the
 same
 things


that
 you
 would
 expect
 him
 to
 say.
 Um,


but
 I
 almost
 think
 the
 market
 needs
 him


to
 say
 these
 things
 over
 and
 over
 again


for
 them
 to
 feel
 happy.
 So,
 on
 my
 market


open,
 we
 didn't
 watch
 JPAL
 live.
 I


predicted
 JPAL's
 going
 to
 say
 labor


market's
 weak,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 more


rate
 cuts.
 JPAL
 said
 in
 a
 nutshell,


labor
 market's
 weak,
 we're
 going
 to
 get


more
 rate
 cuts.
 or
 we
 are
 the
 labor


market
 weakness
 is
 signaling
 that
 we


will
 have
 more
 rate
 cuts.
 He
 didn't


literally
 say
 we're
 going to
 have
 more


rate
 cuts,
 but
 he
 said
 uh
 you're
 likely


going
 to
 have
 some
 rate
 cuts.
 And
 so
 as


a
 result,


he
 didn't
 literally
 say
 we're
 going to


have
 rate
 cuts,
 but
 he
 basically


signaled
 that
 we're
 going to
 have
 rate


cuts.
 So
 as
 a
 result,
 that
 was
 another


reason
 why
 the
 markets
 got
 excited.
 They


were
 like,
 "All
 right,
 so
 JPAL
 is


definitely
 on
 board
 with
 the
 rate
 cut


thesis.
 JPAL
 understands
 the
 risks
 to


the
 labor
 market
 from
 a
 low
 hiring


economy
 uh
 along
 with
 AI
 potentially


commoditizing
 jobs.
 We've
 been
 talking


about
 that
 a
 lot
 on
 the
 channel,
 what's


going
 to
 happen
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 these


different
 jobs,
 blue
 collar
 and
 white


collar
 jobs
 in
 the
 world
 of
 AI.
 And
 so


you
 probably
 want
 to
 have
 rates
 low
 to


at least
 be
 able
 to
 get
 ready
 to
 cushion


the
 impact
 if
 there
 is
 more
 significant


job
 loss.
 And
 then
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 get


rate
 cuts,
 the
 market
 is
 able
 to
 price


that
 in.
 Now,
 two
 other
 things
 he
 said


that
 I
 think
 were
 really
 important.


Number
 one,
 he
 said
 the
 data
 is
 showing


that
 the
 economy
 is
 largely
 where
 it
 was


in
 September.
 Now,
 we
 don't
 have
 a
 lot


of
 data
 because
 the
 government
 shutdown.


By
 the
 way,
 Kali's
 estimating
 that


government
 shutdown
 has
 a
 30%
 chance
 to


last
 until
 November
 16th.
 So,
 that
 might


be
 a
 little
 bit
 longer
 than
 expected,


but
 JPAL
 did
 say
 the
 data
 before
 the


shutdown
 suggests
 that
 growth
 may
 be


better
 than
 expected,
 largely
 where
 it


was
 in
 September.
 So,
 this
 was
 really


bullish
 because
 if
 you
 have
 the
 labor


market
 weakening,
 which
 indicates
 a


reason
 to
 cut
 rates,
 right?
 because
 if


jobs
 go
 down,
 you
 want
 to
 be able
 to


have
 that
 cushion
 for
 the
 labor
 market


with
 rate
 cuts
 and
 growth
 is
 not
 de


accelerating


which
 would
 hurt
 earnings
 and
 hurt
 the


broader
 economy
 if
 growth
 is
 going
 down.


Then
 I
 mean
 you've
 got
 a
 scenario
 where


assets
 are
 able
 to
 benefit
 from
 rate


cuts
 but
 also
 growth
 doesn't
 have
 to


slow
 down
 which
 is
 good
 for
 the
 earnings


on
 those
 assets.
 The
 final
 thing
 JPAL


said
 which
 was
 the
 most
 important
 thing


uh
 that
 he
 that
 he
 made
 in
 terms
 of
 his


statements
 is
 the
 central
 bank
 of
 the


United
 States
 is
 nearing
 a
 point
 where


it
 will
 stop
 reducing
 the
 size
 of
 its


bond
 holdings
 but
 gave
 no
 longrun


indication
 of
 where
 interest
 rates
 are


ultimately
 headed.
 Essentially
 the
 TLDDR


on
 that
 is
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 stop


quantitative
 tightening.
 So
 when
 they


are
 dumping
 bonds
 that
 is
 quantitative


tightening.
 that
 is
 reducing
 the
 size
 of


the
 balance
 sheet
 and
 that
 is
 entering


less
 liquidity
 into
 the
 system
 because


obviously
 you're
 tightening
 the
 overall


balance
 sheet
 in
 general.
 Quantitative


easing
 QE
 and
 you
 know
 JPAL
 was
 such
 a


QT
 in
 my
 opinion
 for
 telling
 us
 that
 he


is
 ready
 to
 engage
 in
 QE
 again
 is
 what


we
 had
 in
 2020
 when
 the
 Fed
 started


buying
 up
 bonds
 and
 as
 a
 result
 you
 have


more
 liquidity,
 more
 liquidity,
 lower


rates.
 That
 is
 basically
 the
 scenario


for
 getting
 asset
 prices
 to
 go
 up.
 Does


that
 result
 in
 a
 bubble?
 Maybe.
 We'll


worry
 about
 that
 when
 that
 happens.
 But


the
 point
 is
 today
 the
 market
 simply


needed
 a
 signal
 on
 hey
 are
 we
 going
 to


stop
 the
 contraction
 of
 the
 US
 balance


sheet
 and
 JPA
 basically
 said
 that's


coming
 to
 an
 end
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


Now
 we
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 for
 sure


going
 to
 happen
 but
 that
 was
 the


perception
 of
 what
 the
 market
 took
 away


from
 his
 comments
 and
 as
 a
 result
 stocks


went
 higher.
 So
 pretty
 wild
 1.5%
 swing


to
 the
 downside.
 If
 you
 bought
 the
 dip


on
 anything
 at
 that
 time
 you
 probably


did
 well.
 And
 now
 at
 the
 time
 of


recording
 this
 we're
 up
 about
 half
 a


percent
 based
 on
 what
 Greer
 said
 and


based
 on
 what
 JP
 said.
 All
 right,
 next


up
 we've
 got
 bank
 earnings.
 Uh
 the
 banks


crushed
 it.
 The
 banks
 absolutely
 crushed


it,
 folks.
 So
 the
 main
 banks
 that
 we
 had


today,
 and
 the
 reason
 the
 banks
 matter,


even
 if
 you
 are
 not
 invested
 in
 banks,


uh
 is
 because
 they
 are
 the
 financial


ecosystem
 of
 the
 United
 States.
 If
 the


financial
 structure
 of
 the
 US
 is
 strong,


loans
 are
 being
 dispersed,
 credit
 law,


credit
 loss
 provisions
 aren't
 that
 bad,


delinquencies
 aren't
 that
 bad,
 capital


spending
 is
 strong,
 M&A
 is
 strong,
 IPOs,


underwriting
 of
 different
 forms
 of


credit
 are
 not
 at
 a
 horrible
 level,
 then


that
 means
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 economy,
 aka


big
 tech,
 which
 largely
 relies
 on


financials.
 I
 mean,
 obviously
 the
 big
 uh


tech
 balance
 sheets
 don't
 literally
 need


loans
 and
 and
 access
 to
 the
 the
 capital


debt
 markets,
 but
 it
 is
 good
 to
 make


sure
 that
 the
 capital
 debt
 markets
 are


in
 the
 right
 shape
 if
 those
 are
 needed.


And
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 tech


companies
 that
 are
 not
 as
 big
 as
 Amazon


that
 do
 need
 access
 to
 loans
 and


banking.
 And
 the
 banks
 need
 to
 be
 in
 the


right
 position.
 JP
 Morgan
 beat
 on
 the


top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 Black
 Rockck
 beat
 on


the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 City
 beat
 on
 the


top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 Goldman
 Sachs
 beat


on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 And
 Wells


Fargo
 had
 a
 ma
 massive
 beat
 on
 the
 top


and
 the
 bottom.
 Wells
 Fargo
 up
 7%
 on
 the


day.
 the
 rest
 of
 those
 relatively
 flat


to
 red.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 stocks


were
 up
 20
 to
 30%.
 So,
 you
 know,
 they


don't
 have
 to
 go
 up
 just
 because
 they


have
 a
 good
 earnings,
 but
 nonetheless,


all
 those
 stocks
 uh
 or
 all
 those


companies
 had
 a
 phenomenal
 earnings
 and


eventually
 their
 stocks
 will
 potentially


reflect
 that.
 Um,
 I
 think
 the
 most


important
 thing
 from
 the
 bank
 earnings


is
 some
 of
 the
 quotes
 that
 we
 got
 from


some
 of
 these
 CEOs.
 So,
 Larry
 Frink


basically
 said
 there's
 about
 four
 and
 a


half
 trillion
 dollars
 of
 essentially


financial
 assets
 that
 are
 already


tokenized
 in
 the
 context
 of
 stocks,


stable
 coins.
 uh
 his
 ambitions
 to
 turn


that
 into
 real
 estate
 etc.
 So
 you've
 got


some
 pretty
 good
 um
 essentially


prerogatives
 from
 Larry
 Frink
 on
 the


idea
 that
 if
 tokenization
 is
 already


happening
 and
 4
 and
 a.5
 trillion
 out
 of


the
 13.5
 trillion
 of
 assets
 they
 have
 is


related
 to
 crypto
 tokenized
 assets
 etc.


then
 you're
 likely
 going
 to
 get
 a


pathway
 for
 those
 to
 increase
 which
 is


bullish
 for
 Robin
 Hood,
 Coinbase,


Kraken,
 all
 the
 companies
 that
 deal
 with


the
 tokenized
 ecosystem.
 Uh
 and
 then


Larry
 Fank
 specifically
 said
 uh
 the
 the


the
 value
 is
 held
 in
 digital
 wallets
 and


we
 expect
 it
 to
 expand
 rapidly
 across


crypto
 stable
 coins
 and
 tokenized


assets.
 So
 that's
 the
 first
 thing
 and


then
 the
 second
 thing
 he
 said
 which
 is


really
 important
 as
 well
 is
 about
 data


centers.
 So,
 we
 know
 that
 Black
 Rock
 JP


Morgan
 yesterday
 JP
 Morgan
 announced
 a
 $


1.5
 trillion
 initiative
 to
 increase


energy,
 data
 centers,
 and
 like
 10


different
 other
 sectors,
 but
 energy
 and


data
 centers
 are
 two
 of the
 most


important
 things
 uh
 that
 they're
 going


to
 be
 investing
 over
 the
 next
 10
 years


into
 the
 United
 States
 because
 they
 are


recognizing
 the
 demand
 for
 energy.
 Um,


you
 had
 Black
 Rocks
 Larry
 Frink
 once


again
 say
 on
 the
 earnings
 call
 that
 data


centers
 are
 a
 massive
 priority
 and
 that


we
 are
 going
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 data


centers
 continue
 to
 succeed.
 An


estimated
 1.5
 trillion
 of
 capital
 is


going
 to
 be
 needed
 in
 the
 next
 five


years.
 In
 just
 the
 core
 and
 shell
 of


data
 centers,
 and
 that's
 not
 including


the
 chips.
 The
 growth
 of
 cloud
 computing


and
 AI
 are
 propelling
 this
 capital


demand,
 and
 Black
 Rockck
 is
 well


positioned
 to
 expand
 our
 leadership.


Teams
 across
 Black
 Rockck
 are
 exploring


how
 AI
 can
 play
 a
 bigger
 role
 in
 making


sure
 that
 markets
 are
 more
 accessible


and
 efficient.
 Essentially,
 Larry
 Frink


is
 telling
 you
 that
 data
 centers
 are
 a


massive
 opportunity
 for
 financial


institutions.
 They
 are
 heavily


incentivized
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the


financing
 for
 those
 data
 centers
 are


possible.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 you've
 got


the
 banks
 that
 pretty
 much
 crushed


earnings.
 And
 it
 looks
 like
 tokenization


and
 data
 centers
 are
 going
 to
 be
 the
 key


focus
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 financial


institutions
 over
 the
 next
 decade.
 Okay,


let's
 talk
 about
 some
 stats.
 So,
 I
 saw


one
 stat
 today
 and
 uh
 I
 was
 pretty


surprised,
 but
 also
 not
 surprised
 at


this
 stat.
 Um,
 and
 it's
 quite
 incredible


when
 you
 put
 it
 into
 some
 perspective.


So,
 take
 a
 listen
 to
 this.
 on
 Friday


when
 we
 had
 the
 3%
 draw
 down,
 the
 worst


draw
 down
 that
 we've
 had
 since
 April.


Well,
 the
 market
 went
 up,
 the
 market


went
 down.
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 a
 pretty
 crazy


day.
 And
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 market


going
 up
 and
 down,
 obviously,
 it
 was


very
 volatile.
 So,
 traders
 traded
 within


the
 volatility.
 The
 total
 US
 option


volume
 hit
 a
 record
 high
 108
 million


contracts
 that
 were
 traded
 on
 Friday.


To
 put
 it
 into
 perspective,
 in
 2021,
 the


highest
 amount
 of
 volume,
 puts
 and
 calls


together
 in
 the
 options
 market
 um
 was
 60


million
 and
 that
 was
 at
 the
 peak
 of
 what


was
 happening
 in
 2021.
 So,
 this
 was


almost
 double
 the
 amount
 of
 volume
 from


four
 years
 ago
 and
 2021
 was
 a
 pretty


crazy
 time.
 Again,
 I
 don't
 think
 we're


in
 2021.
 We've
 talked
 about
 that
 a
 lot


on
 the
 channel
 why
 there's
 some,
 you


know,
 unique
 fundamentally


differentiated
 aspects
 towards
 how
 we


can
 conceptualize
 what
 was
 happening
 in


2021
 versus
 now.
 rate
 cuts,
 earnings,


AI,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 variables


to
 it,
 but
 yes,
 there
 is
 some
 froth
 in


the
 market
 and
 some
 of
 that
 froth
 is


going
 to
 be
 there.
 And
 when
 that
 froth


is
 there,
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 record


option
 volumes
 like
 this.
 You're
 also


going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 want


to
 hedge
 to
 the
 downside
 if
 you're


getting
 a
 3%
 draw
 down.
 61
 million
 calls


were
 traded
 on
 Friday,
 47
 million
 puts.


The
 puts
 were
 the
 second
 largest
 on


record.
 The
 calls
 were
 an
 all-time
 high,


and
 this
 also
 beat
 April's
 Liberation


Day
 trading
 activity
 when
 a
 100
 million


options
 were
 traded
 in
 one
 day.


uh
 super
 bullish
 Robin
 Hood,
 super


bullish
 Weeble,
 super
 bullish
 Fidelity


Schwab.
 All
 these
 brokerages
 benefit


from
 the
 volatility
 of
 going
 up
 and


down.
 But
 the
 point
 is
 we
 are
 in
 a


massive
 generation
 of
 investors
 that


from
 my
 perspective,
 whether
 it's
 retail


or
 institutional,
 are
 either
 ready
 to


buy
 the
 dip.
 Number
 one,
 uh
 another
 stat


for
 you
 guys
 is
 that
 NVDU,
 the
 2x


leverage
 Nvidia
 fund,
 picked
 up
 130


million
 of
 inflows
 on
 Friday.
 So
 Nvidia


went
 down
 5%
 and
 people
 piled
 into


leverage
 Nvidia.
 uh
 which
 is
 quite


incredible.
 We're
 going to
 get
 more


stats
 over
 the
 coming
 days
 on
 how
 much


of
 the
 dip
 was
 actually
 bought
 on
 Friday


by
 retail.
 Uh
 the
 three
 stocks
 that
 were


bought
 the
 most
 were
 Meta,
 Nvidia,
 and


Hood
 as
 per
 JP
 Morgan.
 So
 that
 came
 out


yesterday
 as
 well.
 But
 we
 are
 in
 this


opportunity
 for
 a
 generation
 of


investors
 that
 see
 every
 market
 draw


down
 as
 a
 reason
 to
 get
 more
 excited.
 I


mean,
 even
 I
 bought
 some
 more
 calls
 on


my
 SMCI
 position.
 I
 have a
 6090
 call
 div


because
 I
 was
 like,
 well,
 it
 came
 down.


It
 should
 probably
 DCA
 down
 into
 these


calls.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 all
 of
 us
 have


this
 mentality
 that
 the
 future
 is


bright.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 growth.
 There's


a
 lot
 of
 optimism.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


excitement.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 opportunity


that
 exists.
 And
 when
 you
 get
 an


opportunity
 for
 a
 draw
 down
 or
 when
 you


see
 a
 draw
 down,
 it
 is
 perceived
 as
 an


opportunity.
 And
 that's
 just
 the


generation
 we
 are
 in.
 And
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 just
 the
 buy
 the
 dip
 generation
 of


retail.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 buy
 the
 chip


generation
 of
 institutional
 investors


that
 realize
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 get


the
 amazing
 prices
 they
 were
 going
 to


get
 four,
 five,
 10
 years
 ago
 when
 you


had
 a
 draw
 down
 because
 that
 draw
 down


is
 easily
 eaten
 up
 and
 108
 million


contracts
 traded
 in
 one
 day
 because
 of
 a


tweet
 from
 Trump
 about
 China
 causing
 a


3%
 draw
 down
 is
 quite
 remarkable.
 So
 I


think
 the
 takeaway
 for
 investors
 here


and
 let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 you


know
 loaded
 up
 on
 call
 options
 or
 put


options
 or
 sold
 called
 sold
 puts
 during


that
 Friday
 is
 that
 people
 are
 ready
 to


take
 advantage
 of
 the
 opportunity
 if


there
 an
 opport
 if
 the
 opportunity
 is


presented
 and
 and
 the
 final
 thing
 on


this
 is
 that
 there
 are
 still
 $7.5


trillion
 on
 the
 sidelines
 getting
 three


and a
 half%
 for
 money
 market
 funds
 when


that
 three
 and
 a
 half%
 becomes


potentially
 two
 and a
 half%
 by
 the
 way


Paul
 Tudtor
 Jones
 came
 out
 today
 he
 says


he
 thinks
 the
 NASDAQ
 will
 significantly


be
 higher
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 and
 he


thinks
 by
 the
 end
 of
 next
 We're
 going
 to


have
 two
 and
 a
 half
 to
 2.75%
 interest


rates.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 money
 on


the
 sidelines
 is
 probably
 going
 to
 take


some
 risk
 and
 as
 a
 result,
 I
 think
 the


demand
 for
 that
 is
 being
 pulled
 forward.


People
 are
 buying
 every
 dip
 opportunity


and
 as
 a
 result,
 you're
 seeing
 the


market
 gain
 more
 momentum.
 All right,


last
 topic
 of
 the
 day.
 Pounder
 gets
 an


upgrade
 from
 Piper
 Sandler
 to
 2011
 from


182.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 the
 third
 upgrade


on
 the
 street
 for
 pounder
 getting
 into


that
 $200
 level.
 Here's
 what
 the


analysts
 had
 to
 say.
 There
 is
 no


argument
 that
 pounders
 valuation
 leaves


no
 margin
 for
 error
 particularly
 if
 any


signs
 of
 moderating
 growth
 emerge.


However,
 we
 argue
 that
 the
 tremendous


visibility
 on
 future
 revenue
 over
 7


billion
 of
 defined
 contract
 value
 plus


an
 estimated
 four
 billion
 of
 Idiq


contract
 value
 accelerating
 triple
 digit


growth
 in
 commercial
 bookings
 year
 to


date
 and
 an
 unparalleled
 wallet
 share


opportunity
 across
 1
 trillion
 of
 US


defense
 spending
 which
 could
 allow
 Paler


to
 two
 to
 3x
 its
 current
 government


business
 and
 still
 be
 10x
 smaller
 than


the
 largest
 defense
 primes.
 Paler
 has


not
 reached
 peak
 growth.
 Therefore,
 we


do
 not
 see
 catalyst
 to
 halt
 current


momentum.
 Essentially,
 the
 anal
 analyst


is
 saying,
 look,
 the
 valuation
 is


aggressive.
 We
 understand
 the
 valuation


is
 aggressive.
 However,
 it's
 hard
 for
 us


to
 be,
 you
 know,
 upset
 or
 scared
 about


the
 expensiveness
 if
 the
 growth
 is
 going


to
 be
 there.
 And
 based
 on
 all
 the


analysis
 they've
 done
 around
 Pounder's


government
 growth,
 it's
 likely
 going
 to


be
 there.
 Now,
 last
 week
 we
 had
 some


issues
 with
 a
 Reuters
 article
 that
 came


out
 and
 said
 that
 Androl
 and
 Palanteer


aren't
 effectively
 engaging
 in
 um
 in
 in


in
 a
 way
 that
 allows
 the
 army
 to


communicate
 with
 other
 branches
 of
 the


army
 and
 there
 was
 some
 like
 issues
 with


how
 their
 software
 and
 system
 was
 set


up.
 I'm
 going
 to
 end
 out
 the
 show
 today


with
 a
 clip
 from
 Palmer
 Lucky,
 uh,


founder
 of
 Andreal,
 basically
 speaking


about
 why
 that
 story
 wasn't
 a
 story,
 but


it
 did
 create
 a
 decent
 opportunity
 and


if
 you
 took
 advantage
 of
 that,
 you
 know,


you
 got
 into
 the
 low
 170s
 Friday
 got
 to


the
 low
 170s
 with
 the
 Trump
 announcement


on
 China
 and,
 you
 know,
 now
 the
 stock's


back
 at
 180.
 Look,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 I
 think
 the
 catalyst
 for
 pound


share
 obviously
 haven't
 been
 that


expansive
 because
 the
 stock
 has
 moved
 so


much
 primarily
 based
 on
 earnings
 growth.


So,
 it
 really
 doesn't
 need
 that
 massive


billion
 dollar
 contractor
 partnership.


They
 did
 get
 a
 billion
 dollars
 from
 the


UK
 the
 other
 day
 for
 a
 five-year


partnership
 with
 the
 Ministry
 of


Defense.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 valuation
 is
 so


strong
 on
 Palunteer
 from
 multiple


perspective
 that
 they
 just
 need
 to
 keep


delivering
 the
 growth.
 And
 it
 is
 really


good
 to
 see
 the
 analysts
 come
 out
 and


say,
 "Hey,
 look,
 things
 are
 going
 good.


As
 long
 as
 they
 keep
 delivering
 the


growth,
 we
 can
 see
 the
 stock
 continuing


to
 do
 well
 and
 obviously
 going
 into
 the


end
 of
 the
 year
 if
 the
 stock
 can


continue
 doing
 well
 based
 on
 the
 idea
 of


that
 accelerating
 growth,
 which
 again
 no


other
 software
 company
 is
 growing
 40


50%.
 Then
 you're
 likely
 going
 to
 get


some
 more
 momentum
 for
 a
 pounder.
 Here


is
 Palmer
 Lucky
 basically
 speaking
 about


why
 that
 Reuters
 article
 was
 not


necessarily
 the
 most
 accurate
 in
 the


most
 Palmer
 lucky
 way.
 He
 also
 said
 that


IPO
 coming
 up
 in
 a
 couple
 years.
 So


hopefully
 2027
 we
 can
 get
 some
 handrol


and
 thank
 everybody
 for
 watching
 another


episode
 of
 the
 daily
 recap.


Uh
 could
 you
 just
 respond
 to
 that


reporting
 which
 came
 from
 Reuters
 um
 and


explain
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 timeline
 and
 and


the
 inaccuracies
 that
 you
 feel
 there
 are


in
 that
 report.


So
 you
 may
 or
 may
 not
 remember
 this
 but


I
 was
 a
 journalism
 major
 myself.
 Uh
 I
 I


was
 only
 a
 semester
 and
 a
 half
 away
 from


graduating.
 I
 was
 the
 online
 editor
 of


the
 Daily
 49er
 which
 was
 the
 Cal
 State


Long
 Beach
 uh
 studentr
 run
 newspaper.
 So


I
 care
 a
 lot
 about
 this
 stuff
 both
 as
 a


andal
 perspective
 but
 then
 also
 just


from
 a
 journalist
 perspective.
 The


journalist
 who
 wrote
 that
 Reuters
 story


would
 have
 been
 failed
 out
 of
 the
 class


by
 any
 of
 my
 professors.
 He
 refused
 to


include
 our
 on
 thereord
 statement.
 He


refused
 to
 include
 the
 on
 thereord


statement
 from
 the
 army
 because
 they


fundamentally
 made
 the
 whole
 story
 not
 a


story.
 There
 was
 an
 analysis
 saying,


"Hey,
 there's
 all
 of
 these
 security


problems
 like
 uh
 the
 system,
 the


prototype
 for
 NGC2,
 next
 generation


command
 and
 control.
 It's
 not
 tracking


what
 the
 users
 are
 doing.
 It
 doesn't


have
 any
 passwords
 to
 log
 in.
 There's
 no


security
 turned
 on."
 And
 they
 said, "Oh


my
 god,
 this
 is
 a
 huge
 problem."
 And
 we


said,
 "Guys,
 this
 was
 an
 early


prototype.
 The
 army
 wasn't
 paying
 us
 to


demonstrate
 user
 accounts.
 It
 was
 paying


us
 to
 demonstrate
 integration
 of


different
 sensors,
 different
 weapon


systems
 all
 into
 one
 pipeline."
 Uh,
 and


Lattis
 has
 all
 this
 functionality.
 We
 do


this
 all
 the
 time.
 It's
 not
 like
 it's


not
 like
 we
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 do
 this.


And
 the
 army
 said
 the
 same.
 They
 said,


"Yeah,
 we
 just
 turned
 on
 all
 those


features
 with
 just
 a
 few
 weeks
 later.


All
 these
 issues
 that
 you're
 talking


about
 didn't
 exist."
 This
 was
 an


internal
 security
 audit.
 Just
 noting


that
 these
 things
 were
 a
 factor
 in
 that


early
 prototype.
 Yes,
 there's
 no
 access


control.
 Yes,
 that
 is
 a
 risk.
 Yes,
 we


have
 not
 audited
 all
 of
 their
 security,


you
 know,
 all
 their
 security
 code.
 That


is
 a
 risk.
 But
 that's
 completely
 normal


for
 early
 early
 development.
 But
 Reuters


didn't
 include
 our
 quote,
 didn't
 include


the
 army's
 quote
 because
 that
 would
 have


made
 the
 entire
 story
 relevant.
 So


instead,
 they
 include
 quotes
 exclusively


from
 our
 competitors
 and
 from
 so-called


anonymous
 sources
 saying
 that
 Anderl
 and


Palanteer
 are
 running
 this
 fundamentally


insecure
 thing.
 99%
 chance
 that
 was


planted
 by
 one
 of
 our
 competitors
 who


had
 access
 to
 that
 memo.
 And
 there's


only
 a
 few
 people
 who
 could
 have
 done


it.
 And
 I
 can
 make
 people
 look
 bad
 by


slicing
 and
 dicing
 memos,
 too.
 I'll
 show


you
 if
 I
 want.
 I'll
 get
 back
 into
 the


journalism
