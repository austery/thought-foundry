[Music]


hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 SN
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today


we
 have
 Patty
 poppy
 with
 us
 the
 CEO
 or


pg&
 one
 of
 the
 United
 States
 largest


utility
 companies
 the
 fund
 owns
 more


than
 1%
 of
 the
 company
 just
 under
 half
 a


billion
 doll
 and
 so
 it's
 a
 big
 position


for
 us
 now
 in
 2021
 Petty
 took
 over
 the


company
 which
 was
 then
 u
 in
 crisis
 well


you
 were
 pretty
 much
 uh
 bankrupt
 and
 now


Patty
 is
 here
 to
 teach
 us
 how
 to
 lead


with
 love
 war
 welcome
 P
 well
 thank
 you


Nicolai
 so
 great
 to
 be
 with
 you
 and


thank
 you
 for
 your
 ownership
 just
 to


kickoff
 what
 is
 pg&
 in
 a
 few
 words
 we


are
 a
 combination
 uh
 natural
 gas


electricity
 provider
 to
 uh
 almost
 40


million
 people
 in
 the
 state
 of


California
 we
 serve
 16
 million
 of
 them


um
 proud
 to
 be
 the
 energy
 provider
 to


Northern
 and
 central
 California
 now
 what


happened
 before
 you
 joined
 uh
 I
 would


say
 a
 series
 of
 in
 some
 cases


particularly
 Wildfire


disaster
 uh
 climat
 driven
 and
 frankly
 um


a
 company
 that
 hadn't
 uh
 built


infrastructure
 to
 withstand
 these
 new
 uh


extreme
 climate
 conditions
 uh
 great
 harm


was
 done
 to
 uh
 people
 communities


wildfires
 that
 uh
 devastated


towns
 um
 lives
 were
 lost
 and
 our
 company


went
 bankrupt
 I
 I
 think
 some
 people


refer
 to
 us
 as
 the
 first
 uh
 climat


driven
 Bank
 bankruptcy
 and
 uh
 we
 are


rebuilding
 our
 company
 as
 a
 result


what's
 the
 key
 to
 rebuilding
 a
 company


after
 after
 something
 like
 that
 I
 think


um
 recognition
 that
 we
 need
 to
 make
 it


safe
 and
 make
 it
 right
 in
 fact
 uh
 I
 got


some
 advice
 from
 Mary
 Bara
 who
 is
 the


CEO
 of
 General
 Motors
 when
 I
 took
 this


job
 I
 felt
 she
 had
 had
 some
 experience


when
 she
 took
 over
 the
 helmet
 General


Motors
 uh
 she
 had
 some
 real
 crises
 and


safety
 related
 crises
 to
 deal
 with
 so
 I


called
 her
 and
 she
 told
 me
 uh
 she
 said


well
 I'll
 give
 you
 the
 advice
 that


Warren
 Buffett
 gave
 me
 and
 I
 said
 well


okay
 I'll
 tune
 in
 and
 uh
 that
 advice
 was


make
 it
 right
 and
 do
 it
 fast
 and
 so
 it


actually
 became
 very
 influential
 in
 my


thinking
 about
 making
 our
 system
 safe
 as


quickly
 as
 possible
 and
 making
 it
 right


for
 those
 who
 had
 been
 harmed
 it's
 quite


a
 challenge
 to
 take
 on
 I
 mean
 do
 you
 do


you
 like
 problems
 uh
 I
 do
 I'm
 an


engineer
 by
 training
 and
 so
 uh
 I
 enjoy


problem
 solving
 um
 I
 also
 think
 that
 it


was
 a
 great
 opportunity
 for
 me
 to
 build


on
 my
 previous
 experiences
 in
 fact
 our


current
 board
 chair
 Bob
 flexon
 uh


encouraged
 me
 when
 we
 were
 doing
 the


recruiting
 process
 that
 this
 could
 be
 my


in
 fact
 professional
 final
 exam
 that


everything
 I
 learned
 in
 my
 years
 in


automotive
 about
 lean
 manufacturing
 and


uh
 operational
 excellence
 uh
 combined


with
 my
 years
 in
 the
 utility
 running
 a


very
 successful
 utility
 in
 Michigan
 uh


we
 going
 to
 be
 put
 to
 test
 and
 that
 PG


was
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 just
 a
 utility


but
 it
 was
 a
 utility
 that
 was
 in
 need
 of


great
 transformation
 and
 so
 I
 felt


compelled
 to
 come
 and
 do
 my
 part
 what


what
 Li
 and
 the
 advice
 make
 it
 right
 do


it


fast
 I
 think
 uh
 the
 idea
 that
 we
 need


to
 certainly
 uh
 heal
 those
 who
 had
 been


harmed
 and
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 didn't


forget
 what
 happened
 and
 I
 think
 do
 it


fast
 means
 uh
 make
 the
 changes
 necessary


to
 make
 that
 system
 safe
 and
 so
 the


Wildfire
 mitigation
 efforts
 that
 we've


um
 implemented
 technology


infrastructure
 um
 really
 have
 been
 game


changers
 in
 the
 uh
 environment
 in
 which


we
 operate
 uh
 that
 we've
 dramatically


reduced
 Wildfire
 risk
 um
 we
 have
 uh


dramatically
 improved
 our
 infrastructure


and
 yet
 there's
 more
 to
 do
 and
 so
 we're


doing
 it
 as
 quickly
 as
 we
 can
 I've
 heard


you
 say
 that
 you
 thought
 it
 was
 uh


because
 this
 was
 not
 about
 financial
 re


engineering
 or
 change
 this
 was
 about


operational
 change
 so
 so
 what
 you
 do


first
 day
 into
 the
 job
 you
 come
 to
 the


office
 just
 how
 do
 you
 approach
 a
 task


like
 that
 well
 first
 and
 foremost
 uh
 I


knew
 I
 had
 experience
 with
 something
 we


refer
 to
 at
 PG
 as
 our
 performance


Playbook
 we
 had
 key
 elements
 the
 safety


management
 system
 a
 lean
 operating


system
 and
 something
 we
 call


breakthrough
 thinking
 those
 three
 key


components
 I
 knew
 would
 be
 the
 key


components
 for
 transforming
 the
 culture


of
 PG
 creating
 a
 safety
 culture
 and


creating
 an
 environment
 where
 we
 could


serve
 and
 we
 could
 reliably
 uh
 deliver


so
 my
 first
 day
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 what
 I


did
 I
 drove
 to
 uh
 Paradise
 well
 no


pardon
 me
 I
 started
 my
 day
 at
 our
 Union


Hall
 uh
 and
 met
 with
 our
 our
 Union


president
 and
 his
 executive
 team
 because


I
 knew
 I
 would
 need
 the
 partnership
 of


my
 Workforce
 and
 I
 wanted
 them
 to
 know


that
 I
 both
 knew
 knew
 that
 I
 needed
 them


and
 that
 I
 respected
 them
 so
 I
 started


there
 and
 they
 found
 it
 quite


interesting
 I
 showed
 up
 in
 my
 pickup


truck
 in
 my
 blue
 jeans
 and
 it
 was
 just


me
 no
 Entourage
 and
 they
 were
 like
 who


are
 you
 and
 I
 said
 I'm
 the
 new
 CEO
 and


they
 said
 where
 are
 your
 people
 I
 said
 I


don't
 know
 but
 I'm
 here
 with
 you
 first


so
 I
 did
 that
 first
 and
 then
 I
 drove
 up


to
 Paradise
 California
 which
 was


devastated
 by


wildfire
 and
 to
 see
 this
 was
 3
 years


after
 the
 fire
 and
 it
 was
 still
 felt
 a


apocalyptic
 um
 the
 devastation
 was
 still


obvious
 and
 we
 were
 rebuilding
 as


quickly
 as
 we
 could
 but
 it
 made
 it
 it


really
 came
 home
 for
 me
 that
 this
 was
 a


challenge
 that
 required
 um
 speed
 where


had
 you
 learned
 to
 empower
 people
 and
 to


get
 them
 aboard
 the
 way
 you
 did
 through


my
 career
 I
 was
 a
 lifelong
 operator
 and


and
 to
 your
 earlier
 question
 I
 knew
 it


wasn't
 a
 financial
 transformation
 it
 was


a
 an
 operational
 transformation
 which


appealed
 to
 me


um
 we
 uh
 I
 learned
 both
 in
 the


implementation
 of
 lean
 operating
 system


that
 that's
 a
 bottoms
 up
 uh
 people


driven
 continuous
 Improvement
 culture


mindset
 sort
 of
 um
 uh
 toolkit
 and
 uh
 so


I
 had
 learned
 when
 I
 went
 to
 the


utilities
 when
 I
 left
 automotive
 and


went
 to
 the
 utilities
 I
 I
 ran
 power


plants
 and
 I
 got
 to
 experiment
 with


implementing
 lean
 techniques
 in
 power


generation
 and
 then
 implemented
 it
 in


customer
 facing
 functions
 and
 then
 in


all
 the
 operations
 when
 I
 let
 operations


at
 Consumer
 Energy
 um
 operations
 and


Engineering
 that
 all
 of
 these
 lean


problem
 solving
 toolkits
 standard
 work


and
 visual
 management
 and
 uh
 problem


solving
 were
 very
 much
 applicable
 to
 the


utility
 work
 environment
 and
 so
 I
 had


all
 of
 that
 experience
 I
 used
 to
 wonder


when
 I
 was
 a
 young
 professional
 how
 CEOs


knew
 what
 to
 do
 P
 you're
 still
 a
 young


professional
 well
 thank
 you
 you
 can't


see
 the
 gray
 hair
 well
 enough
 I
 think
 um


I
 I
 used
 to
 wonder
 and
 now
 I
 actually


was
 walking
 into
 this
 role
 knowing


exactly
 what
 to
 do
 I
 knew
 that
 this


utility


required
 um
 a
 a
 way
 of
 operating
 that


made
 problems
 visible
 faster
 and
 taught


people
 how
 to
 solve
 them
 and
 that
 if
 I


could
 enable
 my
 entire
 Workforce
 to
 be


problem
 solvers
 not
 a
 handful
 of
 problem


solving
 Specialists
 but
 in
 fact
 the


entire
 Workforce
 to
 be
 problemsolving


professionals
 then
 there
 was
 nothing


that
 we
 couldn't
 do
 together
 and
 I've


already
 seen
 the
 early
 uh
 signs
 of


progress
 uh
 here
 at
 pg&
 of
 how
 impactful


that
 can
 be
 um
 when
 you
 approach
 a


situation
 like
 that
 how
 do
 you
 map
 uh


what
 needs
 to
 be
 done
 I
 mean
 you
 say
 you


had
 a
 Playbook
 but
 this
 was
 a
 different


situation
 yeah
 well
 my
 new
 leadership


team
 thing
 one
 was
 to
 have
 the
 right


team
 so
 I
 had
 to
 hire
 an
 entirely
 new


leadership
 team
 everyone
 had
 either
 left


or
 or
 had
 been
 asked
 to
 leave
 I
 had
 um


my
 attorney
 was
 still
 there
 thankfully


my
 general
 counsel
 uh
 he's
 a
 very


important
 part
 of
 our
 team
 he's
 stuck


around
 but
 everybody
 else
 we
 had
 to
 hire


and
 so
 the
 first
 thing
 to
 do
 was
 to


Define
 our
 purpose
 did
 you
 hire
 people


you
 knew
 from
 before
 um
 I
 knew
 of
 them
 I


hired
 uh
 very
 very
 talented
 utility
 uh


professionals
 from
 across
 the
 sector
 and


then
 peppered
 in
 a
 few
 non-utility
 uh


experts
 and
 specialist
 because
 I
 like
 a


little
 competitive
 mindset
 and


competitive
 uh
 experience
 uh
 peppered
 in


I
 think
 it's
 part
 of
 my
 secret
 sauce


that
 I
 both
 learned
 in
 a
 competitive


industry
 plus
 the
 utility
 industry
 why


do
 they
 want
 to
 join
 you
 I
 think
 we
 felt


all
 of
 us
 felt
 compelled
 to
 serve
 we


knew
 that
 the
 industry
 needed
 us
 to
 make


PG
 successful
 we
 knew


California
 needed
 us
 to
 to
 deliver
 on


the
 clean
 energy
 transition
 to
 really


bring
 an
 energy
 system
 that
 was
 climate


resilient
 and
 affordable
 um
 and
 reliable


we
 um
 all
 felt
 like
 we
 had
 the
 right


experience
 to
 come
 and
 and
 run
 this
 uh


company
 to
 be
 to
 meet
 its
 full
 potential


and
 to
 deliver
 on
 this
 commitment
 uh
 to


the
 people
 of
 California
 and
 therefore


the
 people
 of
 the
 world
 when
 you
 say


competitive
 element
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 by


that
 I
 mean
 um
 when
 you
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 in


the
 automotive
 industry
 and
 that
 was
 you


know
 doggy
 dog


you
 had
 to
 improve
 every
 day
 to
 succeed


and
 and
 to
 thrive
 in
 that
 environment
 um


I
 think
 some
 people
 would
 look
 at
 a


utility
 and
 think
 that
 because
 we
 have


regulated
 um
 uh
 cost
 recoveries
 and


regulated
 revenues
 that
 perhaps
 were


less
 competitive
 minded
 so
 I
 like
 some


commercial
 experience
 combined
 with
 the


technical
 expertise
 that's
 born
 in


utility
 with
 that
 commitment
 and
 purpos


driven
 um
 mindset
 combined
 with
 a


commercial
 mindset
 that
 uh
 every
 dollar


matters
 that
 we
 need
 to
 improve
 for


customers
 every
 day
 at
 a
 lower
 cost
 but


how
 do
 you
 get
 a
 competitive
 mindset


into
 what
 is
 basically
 uh
 Monopoly
 I


think
 teaching
 people
 how
 to
 think


competitively
 so
 it
 helps
 to
 have
 a
 few


of
 the
 executive
 team
 with
 that


commercial
 mindset
 but
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 things
 in
 our
 lean
 operating


system
 is
 making
 problems
 visible


showing
 our
 daily
 performance
 having
 not


just
 reliability
 Target
 targets
 but
 cost


targets
 we
 have
 an
 operating
 and


maintenance
 expense


reduction
 um
 expectation
 we
 build
 on


that
 expectation
 and
 teach
 people
 that


they
 can
 in
 fact
 do
 more
 for
 customers


at
 a
 lower
 price
 we
 can
 save
 money
 for


customers
 while
 we
 are
 improving
 their


service
 I
 remember
 learning
 that
 in
 the


automotive
 industry
 that
 quality
 and


cost
 could
 both
 be
 improved


simultaneously
 and
 that's
 what
 I've


learned
 in
 the
 utility
 sector
 it's
 the


same
 we
 can
 improve
 customer
 outcomes
 at


a
 lower
 cost
 what
 have
 you
 done
 to
 the


goopa
 culture
 since
 you
 joined
 yeah
 we


our
 objective
 was
 to
 deliver
 on
 um


creating
 a
 culture
 of
 service
 and


performance
 and
 we've
 done
 that
 we


started
 with
 something
 we
 call


breakthrough
 thinking
 which
 is
 a
 part
 of


our
 performance
 Playbook
 breakthrough


thinking
 is
 something
 where
 we
 teach


people
 that
 the
 past
 does
 not
 need
 to
 be


a
 predictor
 of
 the
 future
 in
 other
 words


what
 what
 is
 true
 today
 does
 not


necessarily
 have
 to
 be
 what's
 true


tomorrow
 you
 get
 to
 cause
 your
 future
 uh


we
 get
 to
 cause
 our
 performance
 by
 uh
 a


Pursuit
 and
 drive
 for
 breakthrough


outcomes
 so
 we
 have
 put
 over
 2,000
 of


our
 leaders
 through
 a
 4-day
 breakthrough


intensive
 Workshop
 where
 they


learn
 that
 um
 what
 was
 true
 in
 the
 past


is
 not
 necessarily
 true
 in
 the
 future


and
 they
 learn
 that
 they
 can
 believe
 in


and
 how
 do
 you
 teach
 how
 do
 you
 teach


them
 that
 to
 remind
 them
 that
 every


great


Innovation
 didn't
 used
 to
 be
 true
 every


great
 outcome
 didn't
 used
 to
 be
 true
 and


part
 of
 our
 team
 really
 needed
 to


frankly
 have
 some
 healing
 about
 the
 past


you
 can
 start
 to
 believe
 your
 press
 when


people
 say
 we're
 criminals
 when
 people


say
 we
 were
 um
 uh
 irresponsible
 people


can
 start
 to
 believe
 that
 about


themselves
 we
 have
 to
 help
 people
 learn


a
 new
 file
 about
 themselves
 that
 their


potential
 is
 Theirs
 to
 cause
 and
 theirs


to
 achieve
 and
 they
 have
 to
 believe
 that


they
 can
 achieve
 wildly
 uh
 outrageous


outcomes
 because
 they
 stand
 for
 them
 to


be
 true
 so
 for
 example
 um
 uh
 we've
 taken


a
 stand
 uh
 that
 everyone
 and
 everything


is
 always


safe
 now
 some
 people
 in
 an
 environment


like
 ours
 might
 say
 well
 that's


impossible
 you
 can't
 do
 that
 well
 we've


proven
 we've
 reduced
 our
 our
 uh
 employee


injuries
 uh
 by
 over
 50%
 70%
 in
 some


areas
 we've
 reduced
 our
 number
 of
 um


preventable
 motor
 vehicle
 instruments
 or


incidents
 in
 dramatic
 fashion
 because


we've
 taught
 people
 that
 they
 have
 to


challenge
 how
 things
 have
 been
 done
 in


the
 past
 in
 order
 to
 do
 them
 differently


today
 you


um
 talk
 about
 the
 philosophy
 of
 leading


with
 love
 what
 does
 that


mean
 by
 the
 way
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 huge
 believer


in
 this
 so
 uh
 you're
 talking
 to
 uh
 to


you
 know
 the
 converted
 hair
 okay
 good


well
 I
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 rolled
 eyes
 when
 I


first
 said
 that
 when
 I
 joined
 the
 PG


team
 um
 but
 what
 I
 believe
 is
 number
 one


we
 need
 to
 humanize
 our
 business
 I
 do


think
 business
 in
 general
 can
 be
 a
 force


for
 good
 but
 ours
 in
 particular
 we


people
 ask
 are
 you
 an
 engineering


company
 are
 you
 a
 uh
 an
 energy
 company
 I


say
 we're
 a
 people
 company
 we
 are
 people


who
 are
 serving
 people
 that
 is
 the
 heart


of
 our
 business
 and
 so
 we
 need
 to


recognize
 that
 love
 is
 a
 fundamental


attribute
 of
 taking
 a
 job
 and
 and
 taking


it
 from
 a
 work
 pay
 transaction
 to
 a


commitment
 to
 serve
 and
 to
 bring
 your


full
 self
 to
 the
 work
 I've
 had
 the


unfortunate
 um
 duty
 to
 attend
 a
 funeral


of
 a
 coworker
 who
 died
 on
 the
 job
 and


the
 outflow
 of
 love
 and
 the
 expression


of
 Love
 at
 such
 a
 funeral
 is
 too
 late


the
 moment
 to
 demonstrate
 love
 is
 on
 the


job
 when
 someone
 is
 doing
 something
 they


don't
 understand
 or
 taking
 a
 step
 that


is
 too
 high
 risk
 or
 not
 taking
 the


necessary
 steps
 to
 be
 safe
 that
 is
 the


moment
 to
 love
 one
 another
 is
 to


interrupt
 the
 work
 stop
 the
 job
 and
 make


sure
 we're
 doing
 it
 safely
 and
 so
 that


is
 definitely
 safety
 and
 a
 safety


mindset
 is
 an
 underpinning
 of
 how
 we


demonstrate
 love
 for
 one
 another
 at
 work


but
 that
 same
 commitment
 to
 safety


through
 our
 safety
 management
 system
 is


how
 we
 keep
 our
 customers
 safe
 and


demonstrate
 love
 for
 our
 customers
 by


doing
 the
 hard
 things
 so
 that
 they
 can


have
 a
 safe
 and
 reliable
 Energy
 System


what
 other
 things
 than


safety
 have
 you
 implemented
 to
 express


this
 philosophy
 of
 Love
 yeah
 uh
 we
 have


uh
 a
 joy
 survey
 that
 we
 conduct
 I
 do


believe
 that
 when
 people
 one
 of
 the


stands
 that
 we've
 taken
 as
 a
 management


team
 is
 that
 it
 will
 be
 enjoyable
 to


work
 with
 and
 for
 PG
 so
 to
 measure
 that


we're
 not
 just
 making
 these
 lofty


statements
 we
 intend
 to
 measure
 meure
 we


measure
 our
 safety
 performance
 we


measure
 Joy
 at
 work
 how
 do
 you
 measure


joy
 we
 ask
 four
 questions
 question
 one


is
 do
 you
 enjoy
 working
 at
 PG
 number
 two


is
 are
 you
 proud
 to
 work
 for
 pg
 number


three
 are
 you
 loved
 at
 work
 at
 PG
 and


are
 you
 known
 uh
 at
 work
 and
 it
 might


surprise
 you
 to
 know
 that
 over
 80%
 of


our
 co-workers
 are
 both
 proud
 and
 enjy


to
 work
 for
 PG
 now
 those
 are
 up
 double


digits
 uh
 since
 we
 did
 the
 first
 survey


we've
 been
 taking
 the
 survey
 a
 couple


years
 now
 now
 uh
 to
 feel
 loved
 at
 work


is
 about
 50%
 of
 my
 co-workers
 feel
 loved


at
 work
 and
 that's
 something
 then
 that


we've
 created
 a
 whole
 conversation
 with


you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I


observe
 in
 athletics
 for
 example
 these


professional


athletes
 when
 they
 have
 a
 winning
 or
 a


losing
 season
 they
 will
 always


inevitably
 say
 I
 love
 my
 teammates
 I


would
 go
 to
 the
 ends
 with
 them
 they
 they


jump
 into
 each
 other's
 arms
 they
 laugh


together
 they
 cry
 together
 they're
 they


have
 the
 full
 expression
 of
 their


professional
 joy
 and
 I
 think
 we
 in


Corporate
 America
 think
 there's
 only
 so


much
 joy
 that
 one
 can
 observe
 or


demonstrate
 at
 work
 that
 there's
 a


professional
 joy
 that
 for
 some
 reason


athletes
 get
 to
 know
 the
 full
 expression


I'm
 challenging
 my
 team
 to
 know
 the
 full


expression
 of
 their
 emotion
 and
 that's


because
 they
 can
 be
 purpose-driven
 and


when
 you
 are
 purpose--
 driven
 and
 you
 do


the
 hard
 thing
 why
 wouldn't
 you
 know
 the


full
 expression


of
 your
 joy
 and
 love
 for
 one
 another
 as


you
 are
 fulfilling
 your
 full
 potential


as
 a
 human
 being
 this
 isn't
 work
 for
 pay


but
 this
 is
 work
 for
 purpose
 why
 do
 you


think
 the
 athletes
 feel
 it
 differently


for
 people
 the
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 culture


that
 says
 it's
 okay
 for
 athletes
 to


fully
 Express
 Joy
 I
 want
 to
 change
 that


culture
 in
 Corporate
 America
 why
 not
 why


can't
 people
 feel
 their
 passion
 and


maybe
 their
 passion
 is
 spreadsheets


okay
 good
 show
 your
 passion
 for
 your


spreadsheets
 and
 feel
 loved
 and
 valued


for
 being
 the
 best
 spreadsheet
 person


there
 ever
 was
 for
 us
 doing
 Line
 work


and
 gas
 work
 and
 providing
 heat
 on
 the


coldest
 day
 and
 light
 on
 the
 darkest


night
 that's
 way
 more
 important
 than


putting
 a
 ball
 in
 a
 net
 why
 can't
 we


know
 full
 joy
 and
 love
 of
 one
 another
 as


we
 deliver
 such
 work
 you
 said
 people


were
 rolling
 their
 eyes
 when
 you
 uh


started
 to
 talk
 about
 it
 are
 they


rolling
 their
 eyes
 now
 uh
 way
 less
 there


might
 be
 a
 handful
 of
 them
 I
 haven't
 met


them
 if
 they
 spend
 any
 time
 with
 me
 I'll


help
 them
 get
 through
 it
 but
 is
 there


some
 religious
 underpinning
 here
 I
 uh


think
 that
 each
 of
 us
 have
 uh
 talents


and


capabilities
 that
 when
 we
 are
 fully


expressing


them
 uh
 we
 are
 fulfilling
 our
 life's


purpose
 what
 the
 Genesis
 of
 those
 uh


talents
 and
 skills
 are
 um
 I
 think
 each


individual
 can
 choose
 the
 source
 of
 them


for
 me
 I
 certainly
 have
 uh
 a
 source


where
 I
 believe
 that
 I
 was
 called
 to


serve
 the
 people
 of
 California
 and
 the


people
 of
 PG
 at
 this
 time
 and
 that
 I
 was


prepared
 for
 a
 Time
 such
 as
 this
 I


believe
 that
 for
 myself
 so
 you've
 seen


an
 increase
 in
 the
 joy
 index
 uh
 fewer


people
 are
 rolling
 their
 eyes
 these
 kind


of
 things
 so
 specifically
 what
 are
 the


biggest
 changes
 you've
 seen
 amongst
 the


people
 you
 work
 with
 yeah
 I
 think
 their


freedom
 to
 um
 innovate
 their
 freedom
 to


have
 the
 big
 Ideas
 their
 freedom
 to


contribute
 to
 the
 the
 cause
 and
 the


freedom
 to
 be
 known
 and
 loved
 at
 work


every
 day
 at
 10:20
 a.m.
 the
 executive


management
 team
 reviews
 yesterday's


performance
 we
 are
 passionate
 about
 the


work
 that
 our
 people
 do
 our
 people
 know


that
 they
 have
 a
 channel
 where
 they
 can


communicate
 what
 the
 barriers
 are
 that


are
 are
 preventing
 them
 from
 solving
 the


problems
 that
 they
 face
 I
 am
 watching


their
 capability
 to
 solve
 problems


unfold
 I
 am
 watching
 as
 I
 do
 go
 and
 see


visits
 to
 see
 the
 work
 and
 see
 how
 they


do
 it
 I
 am
 observing
 them
 taking
 more


and
 more
 ownership
 for
 our
 business
 and


for
 our
 ability
 to
 serve
 our
 customers


um
 and
 so
 we
 we
 see
 that
 in
 our
 our
 in


our
 safety
 measures
 in
 our
 uh
 speed
 to


deliver
 measures
 in
 our
 reliability
 and


in
 our
 um
 affordability
 measures
 our


cost
 reduction
 measures
 we're
 seeing


those
 ideas
 take
 material
 shape
 in
 how


our
 business
 is
 performing
 and
 I
 think


we're
 on
 the
 cusp
 of
 continued


breakthrough
 in
 being
 able
 to
 deliver


what
 I
 think
 is
 the
 most
 exciting
 time


in
 our
 industry
 since
 Thomas
 Edison


originally
 invented
 it
 we
 can't
 do
 what


we've
 always
 done
 and
 deliver
 the
 new


decarbonized
 Energy
 System
 at
 the
 lowest


societal
 cost
 we
 have
 to
 do
 it


differently
 and
 I'm
 watching
 my
 team


step
 up
 for
 that
 challenge
 is
 there
 not


um
 a
 contradiction
 between
 making
 a
 a


safer
 organization
 and
 one
 with
 more


Innovation
 so
 for
 instance
 in
 the
 large


uh
 energy
 companies
 everything
 has
 to
 be


safe
 even
 in
 your
 headquarter
 on
 land


you
 kind
 of
 hold
 the
 handrail
 you
 uh
 you


park
 your
 your
 car
 uh
 you
 know
 in
 the


right
 uh
 way
 so
 that
 you
 are
 tired


afternoon
 the
 spot
 you're
 back
 in
 in
 the


morning
 because
 you're
 Tire
 in
 the


afternoon
 and
 you
 crash
 all
 this
 kind
 of


stuff
 can
 you
 really
 have
 super
 safe


environment
 in
 that
 part
 of
 the
 business


and
 then
 be
 Innovative
 try
 out
 new


things
 take
 risks
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 uh


procedures
 Technologies
 and
 so
 on
 this


is
 where
 I
 think
 the
 lean
 operating


system
 is
 so
 powerful
 and
 what
 Toyota


taught
 us
 decades
 and
 decades
 ago
 you


can
 have
 standard
 work
 that
 is
 the


determined
 to
 be
 the
 safest
 work
 but


then
 you
 set
 a
 Target
 your
 breakthrough


goal
 whether
 it's
 zero
 injuries
 or


whether
 it's
 um
 10,000
 Mi
 of
 underground


power
 lines
 and
 within
 the
 space
 between


here's
 how
 we
 do
 standard
 work
 today
 and


here's
 the
 out
 the
 the
 Breakthrough
 goal


that
 we're
 trying
 to
 achieve
 that's


where
 Innovation
 gets
 applied
 and
 then


you
 set
 a
 new
 standard
 and
 you


continuously
 improve
 and
 you


continuously
 improve
 and
 you


continuously
 improve
 that
 standard
 so


yes
 backing
 into
 a
 parking
 spot
 is


something
 I'm
 expected
 to
 do
 and


everyone
 who
 works
 at
 PG
 is
 expected
 to


back
 into
 their
 parking
 spot
 but
 we
 just


innovated
 and
 added
 new
 cameras
 that
 are


available
 in
 our
 uh
 Passenger
 cars


they're
 now
 in
 our
 bucket
 trucks
 why


couldn't
 we
 innovate
 and
 create
 new


tools
 to
 make
 backing
 up
 even
 safer
 yet


this
 the
 standard
 is
 back
 into
 a
 parking


spot
 now
 we
 have
 cameras
 and
 in
 whatever


in
 some
 cases
 we
 need
 a
 spotter
 we
 will


continuously
 improve
 our
 ideas
 and
 set
 a


new
 standard
 of
 of
 excellence
 and
 then


continually
 improve
 that
 standard
 I
 do


not
 think
 there's
 a
 conflict
 between


Innovation
 and
 safety
 you
 got
 16
 million


customers
 how
 long
 time
 does
 it
 take
 to


rebuild
 trust
 a
 long
 time
 uh
 I
 would


love
 to
 think
 that
 we
 could
 be
 granted


trust
 but
 that's
 something
 that
 gets


earned
 every
 day
 we
 have
 shown
 through


our
 customer
 satisfaction
 survey
 results


and
 and
 transactional
 Survey
 results


that
 when
 a
 customer
 has
 an
 interaction


with
 us
 um
 their
 satisfaction
 and
 their


trust
 goes
 up
 but
 many
 of
 our
 customers


don't
 don't
 have
 interactions
 with
 us


other
 than
 receiving
 a
 bill
 and
 paying


it
 there
 it's
 a
 it
 can
 be
 a
 very
 passive


Arrangement
 and
 so
 that's
 where
 brand


trust
 gets
 born
 and
 brand
 trust
 takes


time
 what
 does
 it
 do
 for
 your
 trust
 the


fact
 that
 your
 bill
 is
 just
 going
 up
 and


up
 because
 you
 have
 been
 criticized
 for


rate
 hikes
 uh
 in
 California
 over
 the


last
 few
 years
 yes
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 not


just
 a
 a
 California
 problem
 I
 think


that's
 a
 a
 national
 problem
 I
 think
 we


have
 to
 earn
 andove
 can
 tell
 customers


and
 help
 them
 see
 what
 we're
 doing
 to


help
 them
 save
 money
 and
 this
 is
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 I'm
 very
 excited
 about


with
 our
 team
 we
 are
 building
 an


infrastructure
 that
 will
 be
 less
 costly


to
 maintain
 and
 therefore
 will
 parlay


into
 cost
 savings
 for
 customers
 we
 have


something
 we
 call
 our
 simple
 affordable


model
 and
 that
 means
 that
 we
 can
 invest


in
 climate
 resilient
 infrastructure
 but


save
 operating
 and
 maintenance
 costs
 by


doing
 this
 lean
 operating
 system
 we're


finding
 ideas
 every
 single
 day
 some
 of


them
 big
 Ideas
 like
 our
 self-
 insurance


program
 or
 reimagining
 our
 vegetation


Management
 program
 our
 inspection


programs
 and
 some
 small
 ideas
 like
 uh


getting
 laptops
 to
 new
 employees
 faster


from
 our
 it
 team
 this
 range
 of
 cost


savings
 idea
 will
 translate
 into
 bills


that
 uh
 are
 going
 down
 well
 less
 than


inflation
 and
 in
 some
 cases
 will
 go
 down


in
 absolute
 value
 and
 help
 to
 earn
 the


right
 to
 then
 deliver
 a
 decarbonized


economy
 which
 incidentally
 is
 more


affordable
 than
 our
 current
 Energy


System
 we
 have
 forecasts
 that
 show
 as
 we


decarbonize
 our
 service
 area
 by
 70%
 that


includes
 Transportation


decarbonization
 a
 household
 spend
 on


energy
 will
 go
 down
 by
 20%
 because


electricity
 is
 a
 more
 efficient
 fuel


than
 gasoline
 so
 the
 fuel
 switch
 from


gasoline
 to
 electricity
 will
 save


households
 20%
 today
 and
 in
 the
 future


and
 the
 more
 customers
 who
 participate


in
 the
 electrified
 decarbonized


economy
 more
 families
 more
 households


will
 benefit
 economically
 and
 I
 think
 uh


our
 industry
 has
 done
 a
 bad
 job
 of


making
 that
 case
 I
 think
 everyone's


ringing
 their
 hands
 a
 little
 bit
 that
 oh


the
 decarbonized
 economy
 will
 cost
 more


it'll
 cost
 too
 much
 and
 I
 think
 they're


thinking
 at
 the
 extreme
 level
 let's


think
 about
 the
 journey
 and
 know
 that


Innovation
 will
 enable
 us
 to
 continue
 to


decarbonize
 at
 a
 lower
 societal
 cost
 and


uh
 I
 think
 that
 we
 will
 earn
 trust
 and


be
 seen
 as
 the
 leader
 both
 industrywide


but
 certainly
 uh
 for
 our
 hometowns
 in


California
 they're
 going
 to
 experience


it
 first
 Patty
 what
 are
 the
 pros
 and


cons
 of
 being
 a
 publicly
 publicly
 listed


utility
 and
 owned
 by
 people
 like
 like
 us


right
 living
 in
 Norway
 we
 own
 a
 chunk
 of


a
 Californian
 utility
 versus
 being
 uh


owned
 by
 you
 know
 the
 state
 or


municipality
 local
 municipality
 you
 know


I
 used
 to
 ask
 myself
 when
 I
 first
 joined


the
 industry
 I
 wondered
 why
 aren't
 we


not
 for
 profit
 or
 why
 aren't
 we
 just
 a
 a


agency
 of
 the


government
 I
 soon


learned
 that
 investors
 make
 us
 sharper


our
 access
 to
 the
 capital
 markets
 people


say
 that
 we're
 not
 a
 competitive


industry
 and
 and
 our
 rates
 are
 set
 we


have
 a
 captive
 customer
 base
 all
 that's


true
 we
 have
 regulated
 monopolies
 but
 we


do
 compete
 for
 Capital
 and
 trust
 me


Nikolai
 you
 rack
 and
 stack
 us
 you
 help


us
 see
 where
 we
 rack
 and
 stack
 you
 know


that
 safer
 utilities
 are
 more


economically
 viable
 and
 have
 better


earnings
 potential
 or
 lower
 risk
 you


know
 that
 a
 well
 operated
 utility
 is
 a


better
 investment
 therefore
 we
 rack
 and


stack
 each
 other
 on
 our
 operational


efficiencies
 and
 Effectiveness
 I
 care


very
 much
 where
 I
 uh
 sit
 relative
 to


peers
 so
 it
 creates
 a


competitive
 um
 mind
 mindset
 that
 we
 can


then


deploy
 um
 and
 I
 think
 having
 access
 to


the
 capital
 markets
 is
 more
 affordable


for
 customers
 especially
 when
 we're


competing
 for
 that
 capital
 and
 uh
 I


think
 that
 makes
 our
 business
 better
 and


I
 think
 there
 is
 no
 tradeoff
 in
 my
 world


between
 serving
 customers
 and
 serving


investors
 our
 simple
 affordable
 model
 is


the
 way
 that
 we
 deliver
 earnings
 growth


and
 cost
 savings
 for
 customers
 you


mentioned
 at
 the
 beginning
 you
 were
 of


the
 first
 um
 climate
 L
 bankruptcies
 um


just
 let's
 spend
 a
 minute
 on
 on
 climate


and
 how
 it
 impacts
 you
 um
 so
 I
 wasn't


quite
 aware
 of
 the
 cost
 of
 vegetation


management
 for
 a
 company
 like
 yours
 the


fact
 that
 you
 have
 to
 cut
 down
 trees
 to


reduce
 Wildfire
 risks
 and
 now
 you
 are


putting
 a
 lot
 of
 your
 infrastructure


underground
 right
 you
 basically
 dig
 it


down
 tell
 me
 about
 that
 well
 first
 of


all
 it's
 much
 more
 economic
 for


customers
 today
 given
 and
 and


particularly
 in
 our
 service
 area
 we've


identified
 8%
 of
 our
 lines
 not
 all
 of


them
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 underground


every
 mile
 people
 I
 did
 not
 go
 crazy
 we


we
 have
 8%
 of
 our
 lines
 that
 are
 high


density
 tree
 and
 therefore
 spending
 $1.5


billion
 do
 we
 were
 spending
 as
 much
 as2


billion
 doar
 a
 year
 to
 cut
 down
 trees


that's
 a
 lot
 of
 trees
 you
 need
 to
 cut


down
 that's
 a
 lot
 of
 trees
 and
 it
 and
 it


come
 back
 and
 do
 it
 every
 year
 every


year
 every
 year
 and
 that
 expense
 gets


passed
 along
 to
 customers
 annually
 in


our
 business
 we
 can
 trade
 expense
 for


Capital
 at
 a
 7:1
 ratio
 or
 a
 1
 to7
 ratio


we
 can
 trade
 a
 dollar
 of
 expense
 for
 $7


of
 capital
 and
 keep
 a
 customer's
 Bill


flat
 so
 you
 take
 that
 $2
 billion
 a
 year


times
 7
 that's
 $14
 billion
 a
 year
 we
 can


invest
 in
 climate
 resilient


infrastructure
 AKA
 undergrounding
 in


these
 highest
 risk
 miles
 and
 hold


customers
 bills
 flat
 now
 our
 goal
 is
 to


actually
 do
 it
 for
 Less
 so
 we
 reduce
 the


amount
 we
 we
 don't
 go
 7
 to
 one
 maybe
 we


say
 5
 to
 one
 we
 start
 to
 reduce
 how
 much


vegetation
 management
 we're
 doing
 that's


a
 cost
 savings
 to
 customers
 we
 invest
 in


the
 infrastructure
 spread
 it
 out
 over


time
 we
 have
 safer
 infrastructure
 more


resilient
 to
 climate
 change
 and
 lower


cost
 that's
 a
 win-win
 win
 I'll
 do
 I'll


make
 that
 math
 work
 every
 day
 now


talking
 about
 math
 you
 also
 have
 what


you
 call
 a
 triple
 bottom
 line
 right
 so


you
 care
 about
 people
 Planet
 Prosperity


just
 how
 do
 you
 balance
 the
 um
 the


interests
 of
 so
 many
 stakeholders
 here's


the
 most
 important
 thing
 with
 the
 triple


bottom
 line
 it's
 not
 one
 or
 the
 other
 or


what's
 most
 effective
 today
 it
 has
 to
 be


all
 three
 every
 day
 so
 people
 our


customers
 my
 co-workers
 the
 planet
 and


the
 prosperity
 of
 the
 of
 our
 communities


so
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 hard
 to
 balance


all
 three
 of
 those
 all
 the
 time
 you
 just


have
 to
 be
 conscientious
 about
 it
 so


burying
 those
 power
 lines
 is
 also
 more


environmentally
 friendly
 the
 Wildfire


emissions
 is
 a
 massive
 carbon
 sink
 and


we
 lose
 the
 benefit
 of
 the
 the


vegetation
 when
 uh
 a
 forest
 Burns
 and


when
 we
 have
 to
 trim
 the
 trees


especially
 those
 that
 are
 just
 growing


into
 the
 lines
 that
 are
 healthy
 trees
 we


have
 to
 take
 out
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 dead
 and


dying
 trees
 as
 well
 but
 the
 this
 idea


that
 the
 triple
 bottom
 line
 is
 some
 sort


of
 trade
 off
 is
 wrong
 it's
 a
 trade
 up


for
 all
 three
 all
 the
 time
 and
 um
 I
 do


think
 this
 decarbonized
 economy
 we
 are


we
 are
 entering
 into
 what
 I
 consider
 the


Golden
 Era
 of
 our
 sector
 and
 our


industry
 that
 we
 can
 deliver
 this


decarbonized
 economy
 at
 a
 lower
 societal


cost
 that's
 the
 triple
 bottom
 line
 in


action
 but
 you
 have
 to
 think
 that
 way
 at


every
 decision
 how
 are
 you
 how
 are
 you


going
 to
 deliver
 a
 decarbonized
 energy


going
 forward
 we
 start
 with
 um


decarbonizing
 our
 power
 supply
 and
 so


the
 the
 energy
 that
 we
 delivered
 to
 our


customers
 last
 year
 was
 100%
 %
 carbon


free
 we
 have
 um
 uh
 uh
 hydro
 and
 hydrogen


and
 Renewable
 Energy
 System
 uh
 in


California
 and
 we
 specifically
 at
 PG


we're
 going
 to
 Electrify
 we're
 going
 to


enable
 the
 electrification
 of


Transportation
 because
 transportation
 is


the
 number
 one
 source
 of
 carbon


emissions
 in
 our
 service
 area
 so


enabling
 electrification
 of


Transportation
 uh
 also
 means
 that
 we
 can


utilize
 the
 first
 dynamic


demand
 and
 Supply
 ever
 EVS
 are
 the
 best


thing
 that
 have
 ever
 happened
 to
 the


grid
 EVS
 both
 can
 be
 charged
 when
 we


have
 Excess
 power
 and
 in
 California


because
 we
 have
 the
 largest
 penetration


of
 rooftop
 solar
 we
 have
 a
 massive


oversupply
 of
 energy
 midday
 we
 can


leverage
 that
 call
 it
 free
 energy
 for
 to


charge
 electric
 vehicles
 and
 then


discharge
 those
 electric
 vehicles
 on
 a


peak
 summer
 day
 as
 an
 energy
 resource
 on


the
 roads
 today
 in
 my
 service
 area
 we


have
 uh
 almost
 9,000
 megaw
 of
 Supply
 in


the
 form
 of
 electric
 vehicles
 now
 we


can't
 use
 that
 Supply
 today
 it's
 they're


not
 bidirectional
 but
 the
 automakers
 are


starting
 to
 make
 bidirectional
 vehicles


uh
 the
 Cadillac
 lric
 the
 Ford
 Lightning


those
 vehicles
 have
 the
 capacity
 to
 put


power
 back
 on
 the
 grid
 in
 the
 next


coming
 years
 those
 will
 be
 a
 supply


resource
 and
 a
 demand
 we've
 never
 had


anything
 like
 that
 lights
 come
 on
 when


it's
 dark
 air
 conditioning
 come
 on
 comes


on
 when
 it's
 hot
 cars
 can
 charge
 any


time
 with
 the
 right
 price
 signal
 and


they
 can
 be
 a
 resource
 back
 to
 the
 grid


we
 can
 now
 start
 to
 more
 fully
 utilize


the
 grid
 lower
 the
 peak
 raise
 the
 belly


of
 the
 duck
 fill
 the
 belly
 of
 the
 duck


as
 I
 like
 to
 say
 of
 the
 duck
 curve
 use


the
 excess
 capacity
 that
 we
 have
 and


more
 fully
 utilize
 our
 grid
 our
 grid


today
 is
 utilized
 about
 45%
 the
 electric


grid
 especially
 the
 distribution
 system


of
 the
 electric
 grid
 utilization
 is


about
 45%
 but
 it's
 overbuilt
 plus
 15
 20%


for
 the
 handful
 of
 peak
 days
 in
 my


service
 area
 let's
 use
 those
 lower
 that


Peak
 raise
 the
 belly
 more
 fully
 utilize


our
 grid
 just
 like
 any
 other
 asset


utilization
 that
 lowers
 the
 unit
 cost
 of


electricity
 so
 when
 do
 you
 think
 uh
 your


car
 pool
 will
 be
 a
 real
 force
 in
 energy


storage
 so
 that
 you
 can
 take
 it
 back


when
 you
 need
 it
 well
 so
 technically
 the


bidirectional
 charging
 of
 vehicles
 is


starting
 to
 take
 shape
 over
 the
 next
 5


Years
 it'll
 be
 more
 and
 more
 prevalent


but
 even
 just
 the
 act
 of
 smart
 charging


those
 Vehicles
 only
 utilizing
 them
 when


we
 have
 excess
 you
 know
 only
 charging


them
 when
 we
 have
 excess
 capacity
 is
 a


form
 of
 grid
 beneficial
 demand
 and
 so


that's
 happening
 today
 you
 know
 in
 my


service
 area
 we
 have
 560,000
 electric


vehicles
 28%
 of
 new
 vehicles
 sold
 last


year
 were
 electric
 which
 was
 up
 from
 22%


it's
 rising
 again
 this
 year
 people
 are


saying
 EVS
 are
 less
 and
 less
 popular
 I


don't
 know
 about
 that
 that's
 not


happening
 in
 my
 neck
 of
 the
 woods
 where


we
 live
 our
 EV
 demand
 is
 growing
 in
 fact


Santa
 Clara
 County
 um
 43%
 of
 new


vehicles
 sold
 last
 year
 were
 electric


we're
 building
 the
 structure
 you
 are


living
 uh
 where
 where
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff


is
 happening
 right
 uniformly
 across


America
 but
 what
 one
 another
 thing
 what


about
 the
 data
 centers
 what
 is
 that


doing
 yeah
 to
 energy
 demand
 we
 see
 a
 big


benefit
 to
 data
 centers
 in
 fact
 we
 had
 a


meeting
 with
 our
 uh
 in
 New
 York
 last


week
 with
 our
 investors
 and
 our
 analysts


and
 we
 shared
 with
 them
 that
 we
 see
 the


we
 can
 differentiate
 between
 what's


called
 good
 load
 and
 bad
 load
 all
 data


centers
 are
 not
 the
 same
 data
 centers


but
 we
 can
 show
 that
 uh
 if
 we
 added
 a


gigawatt
 of
 data
 centers
 and
 spent
 about


either
 call
 it
 half
 a
 billion
 to
 1.5


billion
 dollars
 to
 build
 out
 the


infrastructure
 for
 that
 specific


gigawatt
 of
 data
 centers
 we
 can
 save


customers
 uh
 one
 to
 two%
 on
 their
 bill


their
 bill
 could
 go
 down
 one
 to
 two%


because
 the
 offsetting
 revenue
 exceeds


the
 cost
 to
 deliver
 that
 new
 load
 but


there
 are
 there's
 a
 break
 even
 point
 and


so
 we've
 now
 identified
 the
 break
 even


point
 but
 I'll
 tell
 you
 in
 my
 service


area
 because
 we
 serve
 Silicon
 Valley


there
 is
 great
 demand
 for
 data
 centers


we
 have
 3.5
 GW
 of
 demand
 we
 need
 to


confirm
 that
 that
 3.5
 GW
 which
 of
 those


3.5
 gaws
 are
 good
 load
 for
 customers
 we


think
 it's
 a
 significant
 portion
 but
 we


haven't
 built
 that
 into
 our
 plan
 our
 our


earnings
 guidance
 and
 our


industry-leading
 earnings
 guidance


actually
 is
 not
 dependent
 on
 that
 so


that's
 all
 upside
 to
 customers
 and


investors
 in
 PG
 service
 area
 how
 do
 you


look
 at
 nuclear
 as
 part
 of
 the
 future


and
 in
 particular
 the
 small
 modular


reactors
 well
 first
 let
 me
 say
 that
 we


own
 and
 operate
 a
 large
 large
 reactor
 uh


two
 of
 them
 we
 uh
 own
 and
 operate
 Dio


Canyon
 Nuclear
 Power
 Plant
 and
 um
 the


state
 actually
 did
 uh
 a
 a
 pretty


significant
 shift
 in
 perspective
 about


the
 uh
 lifespan
 of
 Diablo
 Canyon
 it
 was


scheduled
 to
 close
 one
 of
 the
 units


scheduled
 to
 close
 this
 year
 and
 another


of
 the
 two
 units
 next
 year
 and
 instead


the
 state
 uh
 passed
 legislation
 to


extend
 the
 life
 of
 that
 plant
 by
 five


years
 uh
 we're
 applying
 for
 uh
 a
 license


extension
 with
 the
 nuclear
 Regulatory


Commission
 for
 20
 years
 because
 that's


their
 standard
 uh
 life
 EXP
 expectancy
 I


do
 think
 Basel
 load
 carbon-
 free
 energy


like
 nuclear
 energy
 without
 a
 doubt
 has


a
 role
 to
 play
 we're
 proud
 to
 operate
 da


Canyon
 Nuclear
 Power
 Station
 and
 uh
 it's


one
 of
 the
 highest
 performing
 nuclear


plants
 in
 the
 nation
 we're
 proud
 to
 be


the
 operators
 and
 and
 uh
 we're
 thankful


that
 the
 the
 state
 uh
 had
 a
 change
 of
 uh


heart
 for
 the
 next
 5
 years
 I
 think
 small


modular
 reactors
 very
 much
 could
 have
 a


role
 I
 don't
 foresee
 PG
 building
 one
 uh


anytime
 soon


um
 I
 think
 because
 they
 still
 too


expensive
 or
 yeah
 and
 too
 high
 risk
 let


I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 uh
 uh
 bleeding
 edge


on
 a
 technology
 like
 that
 um
 I
 want


somebody
 else
 to
 be
 I
 think
 the
 doe
 is


really
 stepping
 up
 to
 help
 fund
 uh
 that


kind
 of
 research
 in
 the
 United
 States
 I


know
 others
 but
 when
 you
 say
 when
 you


say
 risk
 you
 mean
 um
 cost
 risk
 rather


than
 risk
 yes
 you
 don't
 need
 nuclear


risk
 I
 don't
 mean
 nuclear
 risk
 I
 mean


cost
 overrun
 risk
 um
 we've
 got
 enough


Capital
 that
 we
 need
 to
 deploy
 just
 in


the
 en
 energ
 delivery
 system
 that
 that's


where
 we're
 focused
 at
 Pini
 now
 you


talked
 about
 the
 grid
 and
 um
 how
 the


grid
 can
 help
 um
 interestingly
 um
 the


Nvidia
 CEO
 yansen
 hang
 said
 that
 uh
 he


thought
 it
 the
 place
 where
 AI
 could
 help


the
 most
 could
 actually
 be
 grid


efficiency
 what
 what
 do
 you
 think
 about


it
 I
 do
 think
 grid
 uh
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 be


a
 key
 enabler
 to
 this
 Supply
 and
 load


picture
 that
 I
 was
 describing
 earlier


this
 is
 a
 new
 optimized
 grid
 I
 tell


people
 all
 the
 time
 if
 Thomas
 Edison


took
 a
 walk
 with
 me
 today
 he
 would


recognize
 most
 of
 the
 stuff
 but
 not
 for


long
 because
 these
 distributed
 resources


these
 uh
 new
 and
 dynamic
 energy
 Demand


with
 EVs
 and
 rooftop
 solar
 we
 can


optimize
 those
 resources
 today
 with
 a


smarter
 more
 digitized
 grid
 I
 was
 just


with
 Jensen
 yangang
 last
 week
 and
 um
 he


and
 I
 had
 a
 great
 discussion
 about
 what


the
 potential
 is
 to
 decarbonize
 economy


and
 the
 role
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 play
 in


making
 sure
 that
 we
 do
 that
 in
 the


fastest
 way
 and
 the
 smartest
 way
 you


were
 the
 first
 female
 CEO
 who
 moved
 from


one
 Fortune
 500
 company
 to
 another
 now


you
 have
 also
 founded
 a
 scholarship
 for


female
 industrial
 engineers
 and
 so
 this


is
 clearly
 very
 very
 close
 to
 your
 heart


why
 are
 there
 so
 few
 female
 Engineers


you
 know
 it's
 a
 great
 question
 I
 think


for
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 young
 women
 I
 think
 they


um
 wonder
 if
 it's
 meant
 for
 them
 and


I'll
 just
 say
 this
 I
 have
 two
 daughters


who
 are
 both


Engineers
 uh
 and
 so
 I've
 done
 my
 part


for
 society
 with
 my
 husband
 who
 is
 also


an
 engineer
 so
 the
 deck
 was
 stacked


let's
 just
 say
 for
 our
 children
 but
 you


know
 as
 I
 watched
 my
 girls
 grow
 up
 we


worked
 hard
 to
 introduce
 them
 to
 things


like
 first
 robotics
 we're
 big
 my
 husband


and
 I
 are
 big
 supporters
 of
 the
 first


robotics
 program
 which
 really


demystifies
 and
 makes
 fun
 science
 and


engineering
 I
 think
 too
 often
 uh
 we


treat
 science
 and
 Engineering
 as
 boring


and
 uh
 quiet
 when
 in
 fact
 it
 can
 be
 fun


and
 exciting
 and
 getting
 more
 young


people
 all
 especially
 underrepresented


people
 who
 might
 not
 have
 exposure
 to


being
 an
 engineer
 and
 seeing
 how
 much


fun
 it
 can
 be
 I
 think
 confidence


building
 through
 early
 uh
 especially
 in


Middle
 School
 and
 High
 School
 for
 Girls


is
 very
 important
 that
 they
 get
 exposure


to
 Science
 and
 Math
 and
 how
 much
 fun
 it


can
 be
 to
 solve
 problems
 and
 first


robotics
 does
 a
 really
 great
 job
 of


making
 it
 fun
 and
 creates
 an
 athletic


like
 environment
 for
 scientists
 and


engineers
 in
 their
 middle
 school
 and


high
 school
 years
 and
 that
 was
 a
 game


Cher
 for
 our
 daughters
 uh
 it
 was


essential
 in
 their
 own
 success
 in
 their


own
 confidence
 and
 so
 I
 just
 think
 um


we've
 got
 to
 reach
 kids
 earlier


particularly
 the
 girls
 and
 help
 them
 see


that
 math
 and
 science
 uh
 can
 be
 fun
 and


can
 be
 for
 them
 totally
 agree
 we


actually
 do
 have
 some
 of
 the
 same


challenges
 in
 in
 in
 finance
 so
 we
 um


similar
 we
 we
 work
 hard
 on
 it
 what
 do


you
 do
 to
 relax
 or
 do
 you
 ever


relax
 um
 you
 know
 I'm
 a
 believer
 that
 uh


relaxing
 following
 hard
 work
 is
 the
 best


kind
 of
 relaxing
 uh
 like
 so
 I
 like
 to
 um


when
 we
 take
 vacations
 or
 or
 what
 have


you
 I
 like
 uh
 like
 a
 family
 skiing


vacation
 because
 you
 work
 hard
 all
 day


and
 then
 you
 can
 relax
 and
 take
 a
 breath


I
 find
 that
 in
 my


work
 I
 do
 believe
 that
 when
 you
 do
 what


you
 love
 and
 you
 do
 what
 you
 were
 born


to
 do
 um
 it
 isn't
 hard
 it's
 it
 it's


joyful
 and
 so
 uh
 you
 know
 taking
 a


breath
 after
 a
 hard-earned
 victory
 is


fun
 but
 I'm
 quick
 to
 get
 back
 to
 work


because
 I
 just
 love
 what
 I
 do
 and
 I'm


I'm
 blessed
 in
 that
 way
 that's
 great
 um


lastly
 what
 do
 you
 what
 is
 your
 advice


to
 young
 people
 I
 really
 believe
 that


young
 people
 need
 to
 know
 them
 learn


about
 themselves
 and
 know
 themselves
 I
 I


subscribe
 to
 a
 Japanese
 philosophy


called
 eeky
 guy
 that's
 spelled
 i
 k
 i
 g
 a


i
 eeky
 guy
 and
 it's
 um
 about
 a
 purpose--


Driven
 Life
 and
 I
 think
 too
 many
 young


people
 pursue
 a
 career
 that
 brings
 them


the
 economics
 that
 they're
 looking
 for


chasing
 the
 dollar
 so
 yes
 you
 should
 get


paid
 for
 what
 you
 do
 but
 eeky
 guy
 says


not
 only
 should
 you
 you
 shouldn't
 settle


for
 just
 getting
 paid
 you
 should
 also
 do


what
 you're
 good
 at
 do
 what
 you
 love
 and


do
 do
 what
 the
 world
 needs
 so
 if
 you
 can


know
 yourself
 and
 know
 what
 you
 love


know
 what
 you're
 good
 at
 parlay
 that


into
 something
 that
 the
 world
 needs
 my


goodness
 and
 then
 get
 paid
 for
 it
 that's


what
 I
 feel
 I
 have
 I
 have
 a
 job
 where


I'm
 good
 at
 it
 I
 love
 it
 the
 world


definitely
 needs
 the
 people
 of
 PG
 need


to
 do
 what
 we're
 doing
 and
 then
 you


combine
 we
 get
 paid
 for
 it
 that's
 that's


um
 a
 purposeful
 life
 and
 a


purpose-driven
 life
 and
 I
 would


encourage
 someone
 to
 pay
 attention
 not


to
 what
 somebody
 else
 thinks
 you're
 good


at
 but
 what
 do
 you
 love
 what
 do
 you
 love


that
 you
 are
 also
 good
 at
 don't
 let


somebody
 else
 Define
 that
 for
 you
 find


that
 for
 yourself
 and
 then
 pursue
 it


with
 abandon
 py
 that's
 a
 beautiful
 place


to
 end
 a
 big
 thank
 you
 for
 uh
 for
 being


with
 us
 and
 uh
 thank
 you
 for
 empowering


the
 world
 and
 please
 uh
 keep
 it
 up
 thank


you
 Nikolai
 thanks
 for
 having
 me
