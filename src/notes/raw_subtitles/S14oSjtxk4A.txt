[MUSIC PLAYING]
ALISON BEARD: The entertainment,
media, and marketing industries
have changed dramatically
since both of you
started your careers.
There was cable and then
internet and then streaming
and then social.
So what would you say is
really the secret to capturing
attention now, whether
it's an individual
or a show or a corporate brand?
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN:
Sure, I mean, God, you
made it sound like we started
in the stone ages, girl.
I mean--
[LAUGHTER]
ALISON BEARD: I mean,
that's when I started, so.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN:
Speak for yourself.
No, but you're right.
Look, the landscape has
changed dramatically
in the last 20 years.
The way that consumers listen
to entertainment or watch
entertainment has changed.
I find that being on top
of just what people are--
how they are communicating
with each other
is the only way in which
to mimic so that you can
be part of the conversation.
And that's whether you're
a brand or an individual,
a show like ours.
I mean, obviously, Jimmy
is on TV every day.
And so he has the
pressure of being
able to evolve so that
he can continue to keep
the audience that he has.
So I guess my
perspective is just
from a brand lens, which is
that in order to stay relevant,
you really do have to pay
attention to the time.
What worked 20 years ago
certainly wouldn't work today.
JIMMY FALLON: I think it changes
day by day by day by day.
You never really can--
and there's probably,
like, a couple--
there's a couple of weeks
where you go like, hey, this
is where everyone's going.
And then it changes, like, nope.
They invented a new
thing called Flip-Flop.
Everyone's on Flip-Flop.
And you go, what?
I never even heard of that.
And they go, oh,
you got to sign up.
You're late to the game.
But it's always
changing, and I'm always
interested in seeing what the
next moves are, especially
on social media.
When we first
started late night,
I remember one of our producers,
Gavin Purcell, who's fantastic.
He was like, you got
to get on Twitter.
And I was like, what is that?
He's like, well,
it's this thing,
and he's explaining
Twitter to me.
I go, OK.
And then I'm like, and we'll
put our shows on Twitter?
He goes, yeah, we can
do streaming shows,
just before we even start up
late night just to gather,
get a following going.
And I remember getting,
like, maybe 100 followers,
and I was jumping up and down.
I was that into
it because I could
see the metrics and the data.
I love metrics.
I love data.
I love to see how things
go up or down or sideways
or what type of people are
listening or retweeting.
I love all that type of stuff.
So we just jumped on
and tried everything
when it comes out and
see if it works for you.
And you kind of have to
learn it and adapt to it.
And I think number one is
still YouTube as far as growth
and how much engagement
with everybody.
It's just the biggest thing.
And I don't know if
there's anything close.
ALISON BEARD: When you have,
though, all these channels
varying in popularity, but
all the smart people and shows
and brands are on them
or trying all of them,
how do you sort of craft
either a persona or a campaign
that can break through
all of that noise?
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN:
Well, I think some of it
has to be consistency.
Just back to the
last question, I also
want to give props
to Jimmy himself
as a person because he
really does throw himself
into the creative
and into the work.
So yes, social media
is a powerful tool.
But without him
actually being in it
and doing the trend
every day, it's
not just like, oh, there's
this tool and this platform
out there, and try
to engage on it.
Jimmy is putting
himself in the work.
And I think that's
actually necessary,
whether it's a show or a
brand, that the consistency is
how you show up.
But if, every day,
you're trying to be
something different
on the platform,
nobody's going to trust you.
People don't like that.
JIMMY FALLON: Thanks
for saying that,
but I think it's also
how you find your brand.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Yeah.
JIMMY FALLON: By
trying everything on.
You go, hey, do I wear bangs?
Do I have a bob?
Do I have a short hair?
You have to try it to
see if that's your style.
And you go, hey, I think I
found my style, everybody.
I think for me, growing up, I
was a very fad type of person.
I was very into fads
and trying new things.
And I was wearing zipper pants.
This is in the '80s.
And--
ALISON BEARD: Jams, Jams.
JIMMY FALLON: Jams,
they're the best.
I love my Jams.
Oh my gosh.
ALISON BEARD: Peg
leg jeans, yeah.
JIMMY FALLON: I
had all that stuff,
and I go, is this my move?
Is this going to be--
yes, I thought I found it.
But it was those--
that generation, I feel
like they were just fads.
There were things that
were in for, like,
two years and then out.
Even the music in the '80s,
it's a lot more one-hit wonders,
I think, than any decade.
But that was because everyone
was trying new things
and seeing what's happening.
So I think my brain, growing
up in that generation
of having one-offs and one-hit
wonders and things constantly
changing and what am
into, probably influenced
who I am today and how I can
function with changing things.
And are you good with change?
A lot of people aren't
good with change.
And it freaks people
out, and they go, ah,
I can't have a new office.
I'm used to my old office.
I go, same office.
It's, what are you
doing in there?
It's the same deal.
It's like--
ALISON BEARD: Different
platform, same person.
JIMMY FALLON: Yeah, I think so.
But like Bozoma was
saying, you have to try
and got to get up
to bat and swing.
And sometimes you hit a home
run, sometimes you strike out,
but at least you're trying.
ALISON BEARD: Both of you have
very strong personal brands.
And I think a lot of that
comes from authenticity.
But how did you think
about that as you
built your careers,
Bozoma, for you
in marketing with big
jobs at Pepsi and Uber
and Apple and Netflix,
and Jimmy, for you
with moving from comedy to
standup to SNL to films and then
late night?
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Yeah.
A personal brand is such
an interesting thing
because many people will
say that, oh, that's
a waste of time, especially if
you're in corporate settings.
But really, it's
just new language
for what a reputation is.
And for me, it's like,
look, when I started out
in this business,
of course I was
trying to mimic the
successful people ahead of me.
It's like I looked
at the corner offices
and said, OK, what
are they wearing?
How do they talk in meetings?
What are the ideas they bring?
How do they do
the thing they do,
and why do people
listen to them?
And I just tried to mimic it.
Unfortunately,
that did not work.
And it didn't work
for all the reasons
that now, as more
mature adults, we
know is because it
just didn't fit.
And you can't be authentic.
And I know it's
an overused word.
But like we were saying
before, even as Jimmy explained
about trying things on and
seeing what fits, for me,
it was like this
unraveling of who I was
trying to be versus who I am.
And then my personal brand
became what it is and is
because it's actually just me.
I do wear interesting clothes,
and I do gesture a lot
with my hands, and I cry
because I get emotional,
and my hair is always
something different,
because all of those
things allow me
the freedom to be exactly
who I am in every room.
And it has made me
a better executive.
It has made me a better mother.
It's made me a better friend.
It's made me a better
contributor to society
and a better creative
for all those reasons.
And so I think the personal
brand gets a little confused
sometimes because people are
trying to strategize around it.
And I'm like, no, if you
just become more of yourself,
then that actually
will sustain over time.
JIMMY FALLON: Is it because
people can trust you?
Because--
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN:
Yeah, right, yeah.
JIMMY FALLON: Because
you're like, that's Boz.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: You
never come out of character.
You know what I mean?
JIMMY FALLON: Yeah, you
don't have to-- yeah,
that's why-- yeah.
I forget who said it,
but someone said, yeah--
God, I always tell the
truth because it's too much
work to lie.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Yes,
it's too much work.
It's too much work to lie.
Yeah, it's too hard.
ALISON BEARD: What
about you, Jimmy?
JIMMY FALLON: I think
when I first started out,
I was just hungry, and
I was focused on getting
on Saturday Night Live.
That was my goal.
So I did standup, and I did
impressions of celebrities
because I knew
that Saturday Night
Live used those
people on the show
to do characters
and impressions.
So that was going to be my
way into Saturday Night Live.
So I would do--
in my standup, I would do
impressions of, like, John
Travolta, I'd be like,
Jesus, I swear to God,
I can't, like, believe
this over here,
like, Sandy, what's
going on, right?
I'm like, dude, I don't know
why Saturday Night Live would
need a John Travolta
impersonator,
but that was part of my act.
But that led to other
characters, which
led to me doing Adam
Sandler, where it's like,
[ADAM SANDLER IMITATION],
and it's like--
and you do all
that type of stuff.
And then you go, oh, that
stuff we can maybe use.
And I just think that was
my ultimate goal was just
getting into
Saturday Night Live,
and let's just check that off.
That's the bucket list per
se, or whatever you call it.
But that was my goal.
And I got that at 23.
And then, once you
get it, you go, OK,
now what do I do with this?
Because I didn't plan ahead.
I didn't have three other goals.
That was it for me.
I'm like, uh-oh, I got to
figure out what my next goal is.
So the next parts were
kind of interesting
because you're like,
now you're here.
What is your next goal?
Do you want to be a movie star?
Do you want to be a sitcom star?
Do you want to record music?
What is your thing?
I had no clue.
So I've kind of had
to think of a new goal
and find it as I was going
and see if it kind of fit.
I think always for me,
as far as material-wise,
it was very family-friendly.
I never really cursed in my act.
I was kind of almost prudish.
I think it was my Irish
Catholic upbringing.
But that's not really
changed for me.
So that kind of stayed on brand.
But I think I kind of
just grew and said, well,
maybe I can do this.
And then if that
didn't work out--
I tried movies.
They didn't really work.
And then you just go back to
just trying stuff and seeing
what sticks.
And getting into
the talk show world,
I didn't really what I
was doing either there.
But I got a lot of practice,
and I was on at 12:30 at night,
where no one was watching.
ALISON BEARD: I think a
few people were watching.
JIMMY FALLON: Yeah,
maybe prison guards.
I don't who else--
and college kids.
But I had to do that
and figure out there
how to have an interview,
how to talk to somebody.
Am I nervous?
I still get nervous, you know.
But it's fun.
It's because I care, I think.
And I want to do a great job.
But you get another
opportunity, and then you grow,
and you see how you
can do that best.
And then you see what other
challenges are out there
and see how you can--
ALISON BEARD: It sounds
like you both very much
found your distinct lanes,
despite the fact that you're
both in crowded fields.
How would each of you describe
your leadership brand?
Because you're both bosses.
You're running organizations.
You're running shows.
You're running teams of people.
So what is your unique
style or the unique thing
that you bring--
JIMMY FALLON: I think
Boz is better at--
ALISON BEARD: --to a
collaborative team?
JIMMY FALLON: Boz is
better at this than I am.
ALISON BEARD: No, but
you an informal leader,
even if you're not called
the CEO of The Tonight Show
or the CEO of NBC
entertainment, you know?
JIMMY FALLON: Yeah.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Yeah,
but he's still my boss.
I mean, I still consider
him my boss, honestly.
So, I mean, you're leader
of me, if nothing else.
JIMMY FALLON: Yeah, come on.
But you have that feeling when
you get in the room with Bozoma
Saint John, and you go, whoa.
This is like--
ALISON BEARD: She's in charge.
JIMMY FALLON: Yeah, where
you feel like someone--
yeah, someone smart is in
the room, whereas I'm here,
it's like, oh my gosh,
Uncle Buck is here.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Oh my god.
You're so ridiculous.
JIMMY FALLON: Substitute
teacher is here.
I'm always reading
books, and I'd
be curious to ask
you also what books
I should read for management.
And I love all that stuff.
And I love self-help books
and learning constantly
about how to do it better, and
even if not, remind yourself
of what works and
what doesn't work.
Being mad doesn't work.
I know that.
So if you're--
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Yeah,
being mad doesn't work.
JIMMY FALLON: It
just doesn't, right?
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN:
It's so interesting.
I think my leadership style has
changed, of course, over years
and different experiences, like
the way that I led my Apple
Music team in launching the
brand and the service itself was
far different from the way I led
when I became chief marketing
officer of Netflix, one, because
they were so different in terms
of not just the
product, but the time.
I started at Netflix, we were
two months into the pandemic,
and I remember my
first staff meeting.
I mean, there's, like, well
over a thousand marketers,
and I didn't see anybody's face.
And I think I'm the
kind of leader that
does need to be in the room.
I like to be in front of people.
I want to see your
face and your reaction
and see if what I'm
saying is inspiring.
Is it funny?
Are you confused
by what I'm saying?
I need all of that
to be able to--
JIMMY FALLON: A reaction.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN:
Yeah, I need something.
I was just looking at
this green dot, you know?
And it was such
an impossible time
of trying to inspire
people to be more creative
and think out of the box
and all of the things
that we say at a
time when nobody knew
what the hell was going on.
But the constant
theme throughout,
I think, for me in
leadership has always
been knowing the detail of what
is going on, understanding what
people are interested in on my
teams, because the challenges
that-- you put all of the
pressure on the results,
and you don't think
about the people.
And I have had
the kind of career
where, in order to
really do the work,
we had to be so close
to culture that I needed
different types of
people on my team, people
who didn't know what I know,
who know things differently.
I take a lot from physics,
which is the idea of matter,
that matter is made
up of molecules.
And you change one molecule,
and the entire matter changes.
And for me, I'm like,
matter is a team, the people
that I'm working with.
And you change one molecule,
and the whole thing changes.
And so understanding
the importance
of every single person
who is contributing--
they can be the
assistant or they
could be the SVP of a region.
Their contributions
are so important.
And so making people know that
so that they want to show up
to their job, they want to do
the best job that they can do,
because they know
how important they
are because I told them that,
has been a constant leadership
tool for me.
JIMMY FALLON: Also, what you
just said, too, also showing up,
I think, is one
thing that you learn
the more you do this is that
all the great leaders show up.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Yes.
JIMMY FALLON: Whether
it's a restaurant--
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Yeah.
JIMMY FALLON: I've seen
restaurants fail all because you
go, hey, we had a great year.
I don't have to go in anymore.
And you go, no.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Wait, Jimmy,
I'm going to interrupt you.
I'm going to interrupt you one
second because, actually, I
have a story about
Jimmy on his leadership.
And this is going to
embarrass you, so whatever.
You just have to deal with it.
We had, like, over 270 crew
members, I think, on On Brand.
And I've always felt that
I'm a friendly person.
I see people, I say
hello, all of that stuff.
But I've never seen anyone do it
like Jimmy does, meaning that--
we were walking
onto set one day,
and somebody was nailing
something on a wall,
bent over in the corner.
And Jimmy was like, hey, bud,
you're doing a great job.
I've never seen anybody do
that in my life what I mean.
Just paying attention
to the small things,
and I think just the
showing up is also
in recognizing
people's contributions.
And so for Jimmy, I think
leadership is not just
how he commands a production to
be done or his contributions to,
oh, let's use this line
or change this word,
but also making
people feel like they
are part of
something even bigger
and that they're important.
And I saw that in action.
It wasn't some theory.
So you could stop being
embarrassed now, Jimmy.
ALISON BEARD: It sounds like
the sort of infectious spirit
that you bring to the show,
to public-facing engagements.
You're also--
JIMMY FALLON: It was so fun.
ALISON BEARD: --practicing
behind the scenes.
Did you learn that
leadership style,
the idea of keeping it
fun, of showing gratitude
to even the smallest players?
Did you learn that on SNL from
people like Lorne Michaels?
JIMMY FALLON: Lorne
Michaels, yeah, definitely.
I think that's one
of the things I
learned from him is
showing up and just
being there for everybody.
I think the power of gratitude--
one of my biggest lessons
I learned from Cameron Crowe,
who's a great writer, director,
but he directed me.
I was in Almost Famous.
You can cue the applause now.
ALISON BEARD: I thought you
were going to go straight
to Fever Pitch, but OK.
JIMMY FALLON: No, I'll
start with my first one.
I'll go into my
filmography after that.
This podcast is
three hours, right?
All right, perfect.
So I remember I was on set,
and I saw Cameron giving notes
to this extra.
And he was like, OK,
you had a long day.
OK, you got three more
tables, and then you
get to go home, and
blah, blah, blah.
And he was just giving
direction to this extra.
And then they did
action, and the extras
didn't have any lines.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Yeah.
JIMMY FALLON: It was
just in the background.
And I was like, whoa, and he
didn't-- no one was looking
at him.
It was just him and
this extra talking.
And he made that person
feel like a million bucks.
And that made everybody go,
like, we're all doing this.
Everybody's worth
something here.
This is awesome.
And I'll never forget that.
It was the coolest
thing that he did.
So I think a combo of that and
Lorne Michaels and Saturday
Night Live and, I think, all
the different hosts that come
in on Saturday Night Live,
too, and talking to all of them
and seeing how-- yeah, I think--
ALISON BEARD: Some
people brought
that sort of positive
addition to the matter
that Boz was talking about
and some didn't, I imagine.
JIMMY FALLON: And caring,
yeah, and just going, oh,
that was great what
you did, I like that,
or when these celebrities
host Saturday Night Live,
they're coming to a place
that they're not used to.
So if you have Robert
De Niro, for example,
he's not used to being on--
I remember him asking
me where his mark was.
Jimmy, where's my mark?
And I'm like, I'm not going to
tell Robert De Niro anything.
You can stand wherever
you want, dude.
I'm good.
He's like, no, I
didn't really know
because I've never done this.
And I go, oh, it's right there,
and then you're going to land--
you're going to say the
lines facing that way.
He's like, OK, cool.
Just help each other.
We're on the team now.
I'm like, I just
totally helped--
I gave direction
to Robert De Niro.
What is going on in my life?
And he loved it, and he was--
and we were laughing,
and it was just great.
ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
So we all know that
the best creative teams
come from putting
people together
with diverse points of view and
everyone sharing their ideas
and brainstorming together.
But how do you all, as strong
personalities with good ideas,
I imagine, because you've
been very successful,
how do you balance sort of
expressing your own opinions,
putting your own
stamp on things,
with also working
collaboratively
and bringing in the
opinions of others?
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN:
That's a tough one.
JIMMY FALLON: Yeah,
that's a good one.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: For me, I
get very passionate in every job
I've had-- passionate
about how the things should
land because I'm
like, oh, I know
that's going to garner results.
Sometimes I've been wrong.
But I always have a
strong point of view.
But I'm thinking back to
times when it's like, look,
as part of a creative team, this
is outside of my own leadership,
which is that you do have to
follow the direction of whomever
is in charge.
It's kind of like any--
like a coach or like a
general or something.
If everybody doesn't
fall in line,
it's liable that you
go wrong, you konw?
And so at some
point, as a creative,
you can have a
strong point of view.
You can have a strong idea.
You can think it's the best one.
But if it is not the
one that goes forward,
you have to submit and
help the next person.
And so even just going back to
your question about leadership,
it is something I've always
encouraged my teams, which
is that once I've
been in the seat
as the CMO to decide
which idea goes forward,
and now everybody
get behind that idea.
ALISON BEARD: Disagree
and then commit.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Oh, I
think my idea is better,
and oh, we should have done
this, should have done that.
That's when we're
all going to fail.
And now we're all
in the same boat.
So it's like once an idea has
been chosen to go forward,
everybody put your
energy into making sure
that idea is what wins.
ALISON BEARD: How
do you steer people
with good, well-meaning
ideas in better directions?
JIMMY FALLON: I always
find with me, I always--
this is just me,
but I always like
to say at least my point of view
on something just to say it.
And then there's
probably someone
in the room that might be
better at whatever the thing is.
And I'll let them hear
my idea, and hopefully it
sparks something that
they can land the plane.
And I don't need to
take credit for it.
But I can hopefully
spark something
that made them go like, oh yeah,
we can take a piece of that,
but I've done this before.
For instance, Southwest, we
did this episode last night
that you watched.
But the challenge
was to wrap a plane,
basically paint the side of
an airplane, a giant airplane.
So it's a big thing.
And we're going, well, blah,
blah, blah, how do you do that?
Well, it's going to be
seen by a lot of people.
And then Bozoma goes, well, when
I wrapped a plane for Beats.
I go, you wrapped a plane?
Who else-- I mean, we're talking
to someone who's done this.
How many people do you that
wrapped a plane before?
I mean, what are
you talking about?
ALISON BEARD: I don't.
JIMMY FALLON: It was
just-- yeah, I know.
Now you do.
Now you know two people.
But, I mean, it's wild.
It was like, she knows--
she's done this.
What hits?
What do people look at?
What do they see?
What are the things that pop?
And you kind of
go, that's great.
We have someone that's
played the game before.
ALISON BEARD: So, Jimmy, why
at this point in your career
did you feel qualified to host a
show on branding and marketing?
JIMMY FALLON: I think
because of all the years
of late night and Tonight
Show, and my job is basically
selling things for my guests.
I have them on, and I pitch
their movies or their music,
or I'm selling their
wares, their products.
And I've kind of
enjoyed it when we
have an integration or
some brand goes, hey,
is there any way you can
mention toilet paper this week
in the show?
And I go, love it.
Bring it on.
What do you want?
I can write whatever
I want, right?
I go, I will think of something.
And then I go, yeah.
And we'll talk
about, hey, do you
put the toilet paper
roll over the top
or do you put the
toilet paper roll
with the paper coming under?
And you have a debate,
and people get in fights,
and it's funny.
And that's a fun challenge.
So I've done that for
the past 15 years.
So that's a long time.
A lot of shows--
I think Tonight Show is
hitting almost, like,
its 2,300th show
or something crazy.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Oh my god.
JIMMY FALLON: So I
kind of love the stuff.
And I had a weird--
again, just an odd idea.
And I love to throw
them out to people.
And so I pitched it to NBC.
I typed it up on my iPad.
I bothered my wife with
all these questions
for, like, months.
And then I go, I think this
is something I can pitch.
And I pitched it to NBC.
And they said, no,
but thank you so much.
You keep those
ideas coming, buddy,
and stay strong at late night.
And you go, OK.
And then I was like--
I didn't let it die.
I was like, I really do
think this is something
you should give a chance to.
I think it's different.
And as Bozoma was
saying, at one point,
we were talking
about this, and we
were like-- because it's a
brand-new type of business
structure, even, for paying for
the show and all this stuff.
But what Boz was saying, it's
kind of like a new playground.
It's a new toy to
play with for brands.
How much fun can we have?
ALISON BEARD:
Yeah, the companies
are sort of sponsoring
each episode, basically.
And so the advertisement
isn't necessarily
what's generated
by the contestants.
It's the show itself.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: I also want
to say that I know Jimmy--
he's creative, and he has done
a lot of work with brands.
But he's also a
student of marketing.
I don't want to let
that academic part go,
because we were just on
a show together where
we're playing a little
quiz game of like,
oh, the taglines
and this and that.
And Jimmy, he was getting them.
And not only that, he's got
the jingles, and he remembers.
And so it's like for
someone who hasn't
had a formal career in
marketing, he's still an ad guy.
I would consider him an ad guy.
And so there's a natural love
and curiosity for the business
of marketing and advertising.
And so that, I think,
also has a great deal
to do with why it's
natural for him
to be the one who
developed the show
and brought it to the world.
ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
JIMMY FALLON: I mean, I
love a good-- don't you
love to see a good campaign?
ALISON BEARD: Yes, absolutely.
JIMMY FALLON: I love a great--
I think Ryan Reynolds is
knocking it out of the park.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Amazing.
Amazing.
ALISON BEARD:
Actually, he's going
to write an article
in our next--
well, co-author an article
in our next issue about
fastvertising and how
to quickly capitalize--
JIMMY FALLON: Oh, he's the best.
He's the best at that.
ALISON BEARD: --on
a cultural moment.
JIMMY FALLON: Also,
probably, people
wouldn't have normally
given him a chance had he
been on a team or
a famous ad agency.
I mean, I think he used his fame
to go, like, give me a chance.
I'm going to roll
the dice on this.
ALISON BEARD: It
sounds like you're
saying that in this very crowded
marketplace, as companies are
thinking about how to
break through, whether it's
small ones or massive ones,
brand integration is one
avenue that everyone's keen.
There is a sort of obviousness
to it, though, right?
So how do you do it in a way
that does feel authentic and not
just like, ugh, I'm being
marketed to right now?
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Well, I
think it should be obvious.
Right?
I feel like that's
where brands go wrong
when they try to be in a place
where they're not naturally.
We excuse Jimmy because he
can actually do it very well.
So toilet paper maybe
doesn't belong on his desk,
but he's going to find
a way to bring it in.
But the challenge most
times is that brands
are trying to find integration
in scenarios where they simply
shouldn't be, because it's not
natural for them to be there.
And that's why it
falls apart, not
because somebody was
like sitting there
holding their thing, and
saying, hey, look at this thing,
but because it just
wasn't natural to them.
And so it's like, look,
when you're in the space,
it should be obvious
that I picked up my Pepsi
and drank it because
I was thirsty.
ALISON BEARD: And
then the second sort
of avenue you talked about
was this idea of capitalizing
on cultural moments.
And, Jimmy, you certainly
do that with your show.
Bozoma, you did it,
I'm sure, working
at Netflix and Apple
and all these sort
of fast-paced consumer brands.
So talk about how you
do that in a way that
doesn't seem hamhanded
and actually does
sort of reach the audience
you're trying to get to.
JIMMY FALLON: Again,
there has to be
some authenticity
behind it, too,
even though it is the moment.
But you take the moment,
and how do you make it you?
So if it is doing a Taylor
Swift dance challenge,
I can do it with Taylor.
The other way to do it is to
just do the dance challenge
myself and be a 51-year-old man
trying to do a dance challenge
on TikTok.
And that's what it looks like.
And it's like, that's
more authentic.
And he's not trying
to be a teenager.
He's acting his age.
I mean, I'm feeling it now.
My era, I'm feeling I'm
going into my old man era,
or getting older era.
I feel like if I'm
in a high-top table,
if I go to a restaurant with a
high-top, if I drop my napkin,
I'm not picking it up.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: No, no.
JIMMY FALLON: My back
will hurt, and I will--
ALISON BEARD: And we definitely
can't read the writing
on the menus either, so.
JIMMY FALLON: No, I'm done.
I'm not the person yet that
turns the flashlight on,
but I'm real close.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: I'm there.
You know what I mean?
JIMMY FALLON: I'm real close.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
ALISON BEARD: So speaking of
sort of being of the moment
as a star, as a
show, as a brand,
it is a very divisive time
politically in the US.
We've seen companies come
under fire for moves,
celebrities canceled,
and executives
are really unsure what sort of
risks they can take right now.
And I think the most
recent example, obviously,
in your world,
Jimmy, is ABC pulling
Jimmy Kimmel off the air for
comments about Charlie Kirk.
And you have made
a point of being
family-friendly and apolitical.
So just talk a little bit about
why you've made that decision
and are sticking to it.
And then I'd love to
hear from both of you
on how you think that corporate
brands can navigate this moment
and do the right thing, speak
out in moments that they
find appropriate, but then not
get embroiled in controversy.
Jimmy, why don't you start?
JIMMY FALLON: I mean,
it's also tricky,
and it's all kind
of moving very fast.
Obviously, if there's a case of
government versus the artist,
I'm on the artist's side.
I think everyone should be
able to say whatever they want.
It's all-- I think
for me, I've kind of
learned from Saturday
Night Live how close you
can get to the edge for myself,
which is being authentic.
My monologues have kind of
always been kind of the same.
I have probably four
or five jokes that
are kind of about
the political world
and then five jokes about
fast food or something.
And I think if you look in the
New York Times the next day,
my jokes are up there
with all the other guys.
But I just diversify myself
with more poppy stuff.
That's just because
of what I'm into.
They do it better than
me, the politics stuff.
That's what they do.
And I'm happy that we
have different voices
out there and all talking.
And if you want
that, you can get it.
And so I think I just
stick to what I do best,
whether it be me
dressing up as a showgirl
and dancing with the
K-pop Demon Hunters,
that feels on brand to me.
I'm not sure if I would want
to see any of the other guys
do that.
I can only pay
attention to myself
and do what I think is the
funniest, sharpest, and most
entertaining stuff every night.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Yeah.
I think in the executive
world, it gets tricky
because you're representing
yourself as an executive,
but you're also
representing the company.
Where I think sometimes
executives get scared,
of course, is that
their own personal view
is going to be
taken out of context
or punish the company in a way.
And I'm like, that is the truth.
So grow up.
Take a stand.
Say something.
And if you get fired, so be it.
And I remember that I was having
a lot of these conversations
five years ago when Black
Lives Matter was popping off
and George Floyd
had been murdered,
and people were like, oh,
should we make a statement?
And I had so many friends
in the executive space.
We were in our
little group chats,
and people were like,
what should I say?
And I'm like, well,
what do you believe?
JIMMY FALLON: Start there.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: You got to
start with wherever you are.
And I think, first
of all, this is way
different from 20
years ago, where
the society did not
expect to understand
who's behind the wall.
It's like now people want to
know, what did the CEO think?
What is their opinion on things?
Where do they stand?
What does the company care for?
Those are all things that our
consumers and our audiences
want to know.
And so you have to express it.
And unfortunately, if that has
backlash, then that is the job.
ALISON BEARD: What
advice would you
give to the senior
leaders in our audience
who are trying to make
their brands stand out right
now, especially when
it's hard to take risks,
in the economic climate and
in the political climate?
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN:
Well, I don't know
why you have your
job if you can't
have a stance on something.
You have to have an opinion,
whether that is cultural opinion
or it is an opinion
about innovation
and what you're going to
create next for your company.
I don't know of any senior
leader who's been put in the job
just to tread water.
You've got to actually
make a change.
You've got to actually make
some impact in the work
that you're doing.
And so I think you can
hear it in my expression
that I don't have a lot of
respect for leaders who come in
and do nothing.
ALISON BEARD: Jimmy?
JIMMY FALLON: I think be
different as much as you can.
Be different.
Take chances.
Take risks.
Everyone says take
risks, obviously,
but I mean really
do something fresh.
Do something new and
something we haven't seen,
and that will pop.
I think you've seen that with
Super Bowl commercials, which
I always go back to.
I'm just a fan.
But having a celebrity
in a commercial
used to be the big thing.
Blah, blah, blah, it's Michael
Jackson drinking Pepsi.
Oh my gosh.
Now that's every commercial.
So now what do you do?
Because that already is done.
Sometimes it was a QR code.
And you go, what is that?
That was the whole ad.
I don't even if it worked, but
it was something different.
And it popped.
And you go, people
were talking about it.
So I think there's many ways to
attack it from different angles.
And I think just write them all
out, see what way you can do it,
and try to see what's the next
or clever or different angle
that no one else is doing.
And if you can do that and
have people think that they've
seen it before, that
is the secret sauce
because if you go like, oh yeah,
I'm used to that, of course.
Where's the beef?
I always say that.
What?
Did you say where the--
no, that's the-- right?
If you can hit that
thing where you're like--
ALISON BEARD: Surprise?
Yeah, surprise--
JIMMY FALLON: Or
you hit a jingle.
ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
JIMMY FALLON: Yeah.
ALISON BEARD: Surprise that
it becomes instantly familiar.
JIMMY FALLON: Yes, yes.
Well said, well said.
ALISON BEARD: OK, I have one
recommendation for next season--
an AI contestant.
JIMMY FALLON: Mm.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Oh,
oh, that's interesting.
JIMMY FALLON: Wow.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Wow.
That would be something
because that's a whole--
JIMMY FALLON: I
think that'd be--
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: [INAUDIBLE].
OK--
JIMMY FALLON: Oh, I
think it would be--
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN:
Alison wants us
to be embroiled in controversy
is what's happening.
JIMMY FALLON: I
think that would be--
ALISON BEARD: No, I think it
would be really interesting.
JIMMY FALLON: --hilarious.
ALISON BEARD: It's
brainstorming.
It's developing concepts.
It's thinking out of the box.
JIMMY FALLON: Do you
think it would work?
I don't think it would work.
ALISON BEARD: I don't know, I
mean, or maybe AI assistants?
Something.
I did talk to an executive
who said the one thing
AI doesn't have is taste.
And so maybe that
is the problem.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN:
That's what it is.
JIMMY FALLON: Yeah.
ALISON BEARD: OK.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN: Well, we
had some people who didn't have
taste either So there you go.
JIMMY FALLON: Exactly.
ALISON BEARD: Well, thank you
both so much for your time.
I really appreciate it.
JIMMY FALLON: This is awesome.
We loved it.
BOZOMA SAINT JOHN:
Thank you so much.
