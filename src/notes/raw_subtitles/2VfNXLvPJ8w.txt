[Music]


hi
 everybody
 today
 we
 are
 in
 really
 good


company
 with
 one
 of
 the
 most
 successful


entrepreneurs
 and
 Venture
 Capital


investors
 over
 time
 vard
 kosla
 vard
 um


co-founded
 Sun
 Microsystems
 back
 in
 1982


and
 kosla
 ventures
 in
 2004
 and
 cost


Adventures
 is
 uh
 making
 money
 in


technology
 whilst
 also
 doing
 good
 stuff


for
 society
 so
 uh
 warm
 welcome
 enod


great
 to
 be
 here
 you
 say
 that
 it
 is
 only


the
 improbable
 which
 is
 important
 what


do
 you
 mean
 by
 that
 most
 in
 this
 goes


immediately
 into
 my
 views
 on
 expert


opinion
 it's
 very
 good
 at
 predicting


the
 an
 extrapolation
 of
 the
 past
 as


opposed
 to
 a
 new
 kind
 of
 vision
 for
 the


future
 so
 when
 you
 look
 at
 forecast
 and


predictions
 only
 time
 they're
 important


if
 the
 world
 changes
 if
 the
 weather


changes
 from
 today
 to
 tomorrow
 but
 if


you
 look
 at
 expert
 opinion


when
 Russia
 invaded
 Ukraine
 experts
 were


this
 will
 be
 over
 in
 two
 days
 the
 same


is
 true
 of
 almost
 all
 large


changes
 uh
 then
 the
 experts
 revised


their
 forecast
 to
 expolit
 the
 Past
 uh


it's
 entrepreneurs
 specifically
 who


invent
 the
 future
 they
 want
 and
 create


unlikely
 scenarios
 uh
 the
 studies
 like


Ukraine
 I
 site
 are
 when
 uh
 the


Department
 of
 energy
 in
 the
 United


States
 forecast
 the
 number
 of
 electric


cars
 in
 the
 US
 in
 2010
 they
 made
 a


25-year
 later
 forecast
 for


2035
 and
 Elon
 Musk
 and
 Tesla
 exceeded


that
 forecast
 in
 2016
 so
 Ur
 trying
 to


make
 a
 different
 future
 their
 Vision


happen
 is
 what
 drives
 change
 and
 they're


improbable
 in
 that
 sense
 how
 do
 you


identify
 these
 situations
 where
 experts


are
 totally
 wrong


I
 think
 it's
 very
 hard


to
 identify
 precisely
 these
 situations


when
 we
 invested
 in
 open
 AI
 in
 2018
 is


when
 we
 made
 the
 commitment
 to
 invest
 it


was
 hard
 to
 say
 when
 they
 would
 be
 a


breakthrough
 in


AI
 what
 was
 predictable
 was
 the
 trend


line
 was
 an


exponential
 it
 was
 very
 likely
 we
 were


in
 the
 F
 flat
 part
 of
 the
 curve
 of
 an


exponential
 the
 early


changes
 uh
 and
 then
 the
 Breakthrough


happened
 so
 there
 was
 a
 particular
 paper


in
 2017
 that
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 quite


important
 for
 AI
 progress
 and
 because
 of


that
 suddenly
 AI
 capability
 took
 off
 uh


I
 would
 call
 that
 improbable
 because


nobody
 else
 was
 predicting
 it
 but
 it


took
 Sam
 Alman
 and
 his
 team
 at
 openi
 to


make


that
 a
 reality
 in
 fact
 the
 paper
 wasn't


written
 by
 Google
 by
 open
 AI
 it
 was


written
 by
 Google
 researchers
 and
 then


it
 became
 important
 and
 they
 scaled
 it


they
 believed
 in
 it
 they
 scaled
 it
 they


made
 it
 happen
 just
 like
 Elon
 Musk


believed
 in
 electric
 cars
 and
 made
 Tesla


happen
 and
 and
 so
 Lord
 changes
 are


almost
 always
 driven
 that
 way
 there's


not
 a
 single
 Automotive
 player
 who's


developing
 really
 state-ofthe-art


self-driving
 cars
 it's
 not
 the


Volkswagens
 of
 the
 world
 it's
 Google


which
 has
 no
 business
 being
 in


automotive
 and
 that's
 what
 I
 mean
 by


improbable
 when
 Amazon
 started
 you
 were


early
 investor
 in
 Amazon
 it
 was
 the
 same


nobody
 thought
 they
 took
 take
 on
 Walmart


how
 do
 you
 find
 these
 situations
 do
 you


is
 that
 people
 coming
 to
 you
 is
 it


people
 you
 know
 is
 it
 things
 you
 read


how
 do
 you
 get
 across
 them
 well
 more


than
 there's
 multiple
 factors
 first
 the


opportunity
 has
 to
 be
 right
 so
 you
 have


to
 uh
 you
 know
 most
 people
 especially


most
 experts
 in
 in
 any
 area
 when
 you


look
 at
 radical


change
 they
 tell
 you
 why
 it
 can't
 be


done
 there's
 a
 breed
 of
 people
 that
 are


entrepren
 that
 say
 why
 not
 if
 there's
 a


plausible
 path
 for
 why
 it
 could
 be
 done


and
 ENT
 is
 ready
 to
 make
 it
 happen


through
 persistence
 um
 I
 think
 uh
 that's


what
 you
 look
 for
 it's
 the
 right


personality
 in
 the
 right
 environment
 the


timing
 is
 right
 for
 a
 lar
 change


um
 the
 rationale
 makes
 sense
 there's
 a


technology
 breakthrough
 when
 mobile
 f


phones
 came
 for
 example
 Uber
 was


possible
 um
 or
 Airbnb
 was


possible
 in
 and
 then
 they
 make
 that


happen
 so
 take
 take
 the
 examples
 of
 cell


phones
 Steve
 Jobs
 had
 a
 vision
 which
 is


very
 much
 criticized
 because
 people
 said


a
 phone
 without
 a
 button
 without
 buttons


for
 dialing
 you're
 old
 enough
 to


remember
 when
 Nokia
 and
 others
 Motorola


were
 the
 two
 big
 cell
 phone
 players
 but


they
 didn't
 imagine
 this
 future
 uh
 Steve


had
 a
 different
 vision
 and
 um
 was
 really


about
 a
 device
 that
 would
 not
 mostly
 be


used
 for
 talking
 but
 it
 was
 a
 phone
 it


was
 an
 adity
 that
 was
 hard
 to
 believe
 so


that's
 another
 very
 large
 improbable


what
 have
 been
 your
 best
 investments
 I


mean
 you've
 been
 invested
 in
 quite
 a
 few


of
 the
 names
 you
 mentioned
 here
 already


but


what
 kind
 of
 stand
 out
 well
 first
 we


invest
 as
 a


team
 but
 uh
 mention
 another
 improvable


because
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 important
 in


the
 nature
 of
 these


exponentials
 in


1996
 we
 invested
 in
 a
 company
 called


Juniper
 that
 said
 tcpip
 would
 be
 the


protocol
 for
 the
 internet
 there
 was
 not


a
 single
 Telco
 player
 AT&T
 Verizon
 they


had
 different
 names
 them
 before
 their


mergers
 and
 all
 that
 that
 predicted


tcpip
 would
 be
 the
 protocol
 for
 the


internet
 and
 they
 had
 other
 more


technical
 reasons
 for
 going
 with
 other


protocols
 uh
 we
 just
 bet
 on
 that
 uh
 we


got
 a


2500x
 investment
 over
 about
 five
 years
 I


was
 at
 kleinet
 Perkins
 then
 we
 made
 $7


billion
 on
 a
 $3
 million
 investment
 uh
 uh


that
 was
 very


nice
 but
 it
 was
 because
 we
 stepped
 into


an
 area
 which
 was
 both
 important
 tcpip


turned
 out
 to
 be
 important
 as
 a
 protocol


for


communications
 um
 and
 it
 was
 very


large
 U
 and
 nobody
 else
 was
 betting
 on


it
 so
 Nokia
 L
 Alcatel
 Lucent
 for
 all
 the


big
 names
 that
 bet
 on
 other
 protocols


and
 we
 bet
 as
 a
 startup
 on
 this
 and
 we


won
 I
 was
 at
 K
 Perkins
 at
 that
 point
 we


also
 invested
 in
 Google
 when
 was
 a


couple
 of
 flaky
 PhD


students
 uh
 in
 but
 they
 had
 real
 resolve


in
 the
 ideas
 made


sense
 and
 you
 didn't
 know
 how
 large
 it


would
 be
 how
 important
 the
 improvable


would
 be
 when
 they
 were
 talking
 about


organizing
 the
 world's
 information
 it


was
 hard
 to
 extrapolate
 1996
 from
 two


kids
 talking
 about
 that
 to
 it
 will


change
 the
 world
 in
 many
 many
 ways
 so


those
 are
 all


improbables
 characteristics
 of
 people


with
 the
 resolve
 and
 determination
 with


persistence
 with
 low
 probability
 high


impact
 bets
 and
 the
 environment
 being


right
 for
 them
 to
 find
 a
 tow
 hold
 and


then
 explain
 from
 there
 those
 are


characteristics
 we
 look
 for
 from
 an


investment
 point
 of
 view
 so
 now
 I'm
 I'm


a
 flaky
 PhD
 student
 uh
 I
 come
 into
 your


office
 what
 kind
 of
 things
 do
 you
 ask
 me


I
 say
 hey
 I
 got
 a
 super
 plan
 I'm
 going


to
 change
 the
 world
 we
 see
 that
 all
 the


time
 and
 we
 have
 to
 judge
 how
 persistent


will
 they
 be
 if
 you're
 talking
 to
 them


about
 the
 investment
 for
 a
 month
 or
 two


you
 can
 usually
 tell
 how
 fast
 they
 will


learn
 how
 F
 fast
 they
 will
 change
 and


adapt
 in
 uncertain
 scenarios
 fast


learning
 is
 more
 important
 than


experience
 uh
 and
 we
 can
 come
 back
 to


that
 experience
 seldom
 helps
 in
 these


environments
 in
 fact
 experience
 is
 a
 set


of
 biases


which
 causes
 you
 to
 extrapolate
 the
 past


and
 not
 go
 after
 a
 radically
 different


future
 how
 do
 you
 screen
 for
 false


learning
 how
 how
 can
 you
 figure
 out


whether
 I'm
 a
 f
 learning
 you
 can
 watch


somebody
 and
 see
 how
 well
 they
 answer


questions
 uh
 if
 you
 challenge
 them
 how


they
 respond
 are
 they
 thinking
 from


first


principles
 uh
 and
 saying
 let
 me
 examine


this
 assumption
 or
 are
 they
 being


reactive
 I
 know
 this
 to
 be
 true
 which
 is


very
 common
 in
 experiened
 business


people
 we've
 always
 done
 it
 this
 way


we've
 uh
 had
 the
 world
 this
 is
 always


worked
 I've
 done
 this
 for
 30
 years
 those


are
 all
 bad
 signs
 for
 an


entrepreneurial
 person
 you've
 done
 it


for
 30
 years
 and
 more
 so
 how
 do
 you
 make


sure
 that
 you
 that
 you
 don't
 fall
 into


that
 trap
 and
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 hardest


things
 I
 do
 I
 I
 I
 think
 the
 hardest


thing
 I
 do
 is
 decide
 how
 I
 stay
 relevant


to
 Fresh
 thinking
 and
 fresh
 areas


you
 know
 when
 I
 invested
 in
 Juniper


which
 was
 the
 at
 protocol
 for
 the


internet
 it
 was
 very
 hard
 to
 say
 we


could
 win
 but
 there
 was
 an
 idealized


vision
 of
 why
 it
 would
 be
 superior
 to


what
 others
 much
 more
 experts
 expert


opinion
 was
 saying
 would
 be
 would
 happen


and
 examining
 it
 from
 first
 principles


like
 why
 won't
 it
 happen
 and
 people
 will


tell
 you
 because


ABC
 and
 then
 you
 say
 if
 I
 can
 challenge


ABC
 then
 in
 fight
 in
 fact
 Happ
 happen
 so


it's
 this
 first
 principles
 thinking
 and


then
 being
 willing
 to
 change
 people's


your
 mind
 mind
 rapidly
 that
 great
 Aros


always
 learn
 rapidly
 from
 being
 in
 the


field
 I
 always
 say
 LGE
 changes
 are
 not


always
 planable
 but
 they
 are


discoverable
 and
 series
 of
 iterative


steps
 by
 smart
 thinking
 let's
 um
 utilize


some
 of
 your
 smart
 thinking
 now
 and


let's
 try
 to
 predict
 the
 future
 which


you
 have
 done
 in
 a
 in
 a
 fantastic
 Ted


talk
 so
 you
 have
 identify
 12
 trends
 for


the
 future
 and
 I'd
 love
 to
 dive
 into


each
 one
 of
 them
 if
 you
 don't
 mind
 but


just
 uh
 before
 that
 just
 what
 these


Trends
 what
 do
 they
 have
 in
 what
 do
 they


have
 in
 common
 what
 are
 they
 about
 my


particular
 area
 of
 expertise
 and
 I
 hate


to
 even
 call
 it


expertise
 it's
 more
 specul
 smart


speculation
 or
 I
 call
 them
 intelligent


gats
 of
 what
 might
 be
 possible
 uh
 is


technology
 driven
 so
 technology
 causes


the
 change
 which
 causes
 a
 change
 of
 in


um
 and
 then
 you
 sort
 of


say
 with
 that
 is
 there
 an
 entrepreneur


who
 can
 drive
 that
 change
 to
 happen


somebody
 like
 Nan
 musk
 make
 electric


cars
 possible
 when
 General
 Motors


couldn't
 and
 they
 attempted
 that
 and


spent
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 before
 Elan


must
 did
 on
 electric
 cars
 it's


technology
 driven
 change
 and
 a
 change
 in


assumptions
 which
 make
 the
 exporation
 of


the
 past
 somewhat
 invalid
 if
 if
 you


could
 make
 the
 New
 Vision
 happen
 of


course
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 generally


doesn't
 believe
 this
 rapid
 change
 nobody


believes
 in
 Airbnb
 as
 people
 would
 let


strangers
 into
 their
 house


or
 that
 Uber
 would
 be
 a
 large
 business


or
 that
 you
 could
 build
 retailing
 on
 the


internet
 e-commerce
 and
 not
 have
 retail


stores
 like
 major
 retailers
 like
 Walmart


these
 are
 all
 radical
 assumptions
 before


they
 happen
 and
 that
 people
 would
 be


happy
 to
 buy
 let's
 dive
 into
 some
 of


these
 radical
 predictions
 you
 have
 first


one
 expertise
 will
 be
 free
 AI
 is
 moving


so
 rapidly
 we
 are
 very
 close
 to
 the


point
 where
 AI
 is
 as
 good
 as
 the
 median


person
 in
 most


areas
 so
 whether
 you're
 looking
 at
 an


oncologist
 a
 primary
 care
 doctor
 a


teacher
 a
 structural
 engineer
 a
 minerals


engineer
 doing
 minerals
 resource


Discovery
 AI
 is
 getting
 good


enough
 to
 be
 huge
 leverage
 on


today's
 people
 with
 expertise
 in
 that


area
 and
 I
 think
 very
 very
 soon
 in
 all


these
 areas
 and
 all
 areas
 of
 expertise


more
 accurately
 I
 should
 say
 in
 most


areas
 of
 expertise
 AI
 will
 be
 better


than
 the
 human
 and
 then
 because
 it's


computation
 only
 it
 can
 be
 replicated


infinitely
 there's
 a
 million
 doctors
 in


the
 US
 couple
 of
 hundred
 thousand


Primary
 Care
 doctors
 and
 then


specialists
 in
 various
 areas
 but
 if
 you


could
 have
 10
 times
 the
 amount
 of


expertise
 it
 would
 be
 near


free
 uh
 and
 we
 could
 provide
 a
 lot
 more


Primary
 Care
 without
 much
 cost
 or
 maybe


even
 substantially
 lower


cost
 that's
 a
 good
 example
 what
 are
 the


implications
 of
 uh
 free
 expertise
 what


will
 it
 do
 to
 the
 world
 I'm
 starting
 to


think
 through
 the
 implications
 I
 think


that
 world
 will
 be
 quite
 deflationary


but
 deflationary
 in
 a
 good
 way
 there


will
 be
 some
 bad
 side
 effects
 that
 job


may
 be
 replaced
 whether
 it's
 a
 sales


person
 being
 replaced
 by
 a
 AI
 sales


person
 which
 is
 being
 developed
 AI


replaced
 by
 a
 structural
 engineer
 or
 uh


or
 structural
 engineer
 replaced
 by
 an
 AI


you
 know
 if
 you
 take
 the
 300
 billion
 or


400
 billion
 we
 spend
 on
 physician


salaries
 in
 the
 US
 and
 say
 90%
 of
 it


will
 go


away
 uh
 that
 has
 to
 be
 deflationary
 will


it
 make
 the
 world
 a
 fairer
 and
 more


equal
 place
 you
 think
 I'm
 absolutely


certain
 uh
 we
 have
 an
 opportunity
 and
 I


use
 the
 word
 opportunity
 carefully
 to


make
 the
 world
 fairer
 more
 accessible
 I


do
 believe
 and
 I've
 been
 arguing
 that
 a


country
 like
 India
 should
 offer
 free


Primary
 Care


AI
 uh
 just
 like
 they
 offer
 free
 payments


there's
 no
 visa
 and
 MasterCard
 in
 India


with
 their
 tax
 on
 all


transactions
 uh
 that
 is
 possible
 and


free
 teachers
 for
 free
 AI
 tutors
 for


every


child
 um
 we
 have
 ai
 in
 fact
 my
 wife
 runs


a
 nonprofit
 that
 has
 an
 AI
 um
 that
 can


assess
 a


student
 in
 their
 weak
 strengths
 and


weaknesses
 faster
 than
 a
 human
 can
 and


more
 accurately
 and
 then
 teach
 to
 their


weakness
 that
 level
 of
 Education


Precision
 will
 come
 for
 almost
 free
 in


fact
 that's
 offered
 for
 free
 on
 the
 ck12


website


um


today
 um
 and
 we
 want
 to
 scale
 it


globally
 uh
 and
 it
 only
 cost
 the
 cost
 of


computing
 you
 also
 say
 that
 you
 think


labor
 will
 be
 free
 I
 do
 think
 uh
 and


this
 is
 a
 little
 harder
 to
 project
 today


but
 uh
 almost
 certainly
 over
 the
 next


five
 years
 we
 will
 develop
 bipi
 robots


that
 means
 robots
 that
 have
 two
 legs
 and


two


arms
 that
 can
 do
 the
 kind
 of
 work
 humans


can
 uh
 the
 the
 hardware
 for
 that
 is


quite
 easy
 and
 by
 the
 way
 I
 believe
 that


industry
 will
 be
 larger
 than
 all
 of
 the


Auto
 industry
 in
 25
 years
 and
 nobody's


planning
 for
 that
 large
 a


change
 um
 but
 nobody's
 planning
 for


expertise
 being
 free
 uh
 a
 free
 PhD
 in


every
 area
 you
 want
 but
 it's
 cell


biology


or
 Material
 Science
 but
 if
 we
 get
 to


that
 which
 I
 think
 very
 very
 likely
 we


will
 in
 the
 next
 five
 years
 possibly


sooner
 uh
 and
 many
 people
 including
 Elon


Musk
 are
 promising
 it
 sooner
 as
 Factory


workers
 that
 are


robots
 um
 that
 are
 that
 have
 the
 agility


of
 humans
 the
 human
 fingers
 for
 assembly


work
 F
 work
 uh
 human
 strength
 human
 form


factor
 fit
 into
 the
 current
 environments


because
 they
 designed
 to
 be
 be
 the
 form


factor
 of
 humans
 I
 think
 that
 can
 be


near
 free
 and
 infinitely
 replicable
 if


you
 had
 a
 billion
 such
 robots
 and
 we
 do


have
 a
 lot
 of
 cars
 so
 I
 always
 compare


it
 to
 the
 Auto
 industry
 because
 it's
 a


physical
 thing
 uh
 they
 could
 do
 more


work
 because
 they
 can
 work
 24-hour


shifts
 um
 then
 all
 the
 human
 labor
 today


whether
 it's
 Farm
 Workers
 whether
 it's


assembly
 line
 workers
 or
 other
 tasks


household
 tasks
 for
 example
 what
 about


uh
 the
 growth
 of
 Compu
 in
 power
 which


you
 also
 talk
 about
 I
 think
 that's


growing
 naturally
 I
 think
 it
 will


continue
 growing
 I
 think
 we
 are
 already


on
 that
 trend
 line
 and
 so
 Computing
 as
 a


cost
 per
 unit
 of
 computing
 is
 declining


very
 very


rapidly
 what
 has
 been
 very


expensive
 is
 programming
 these
 computers


and
 most
 people
 can't
 program
 a
 computer


I
 do
 think
 we
 will
 get
 to
 a
 world
 where


you
 can
 program
 it
 with
 voice
 in
 natural


language
 whether
 you're
 speaking
 Hindi


or
 English
 or
 Japanese
 doesn't
 matter


you
 program
 these
 computers
 in
 human


language
 and
 you
 can
 use
 them
 much
 more


effectively
 so
 the
 range
 of
 uses
 could


expand
 dramatically
 because
 what
 I'm


talking
 about
 is
 essentially
 an
 AI


computer
 programmer
 and
 that
 makes
 all


the
 hardware
 that's
 getting
 very
 cheap


very
 quickly
 in
 Silicon
 chips
 make
 much


more
 accessible
 and
 You'
 use
 it
 almost


transparently
 you
 know
 today
 we
 don't


think
 of
 electricity
 I
 think
 Computing


will
 be
 like
 a


background
 activity
 like
 electricity
 so


when
 Computing
 is
 free
 or
 you
 know


extremely
 cheap
 as
 electricity
 and
 water


is
 now
 what
 what
 will
 it
 change
 for


example
 you
 know
 the
 obvious
 small


things
 are
 like
 B
 building
 efficiency
 in


your
 home
 watching
 you
 knowing
 who's
 in


the
 room
 turning
 off
 the
 lights
 turning


down
 the
 things
 knowing
 your
 calendar


knowing
 when
 to
 turn
 the
 heat
 up
 or
 the


heat
 down
 all
 those
 kind
 of
 things
 but


those
 are
 my
 minor
 I
 think
 you
 will
 be


able
 to
 program
 almost
 any
 task
 there's


s
 billion
 humans
 each
 could
 have
 10


agents
 so
 imagine
 70
 billion
 agents


running
 around
 the
 internet
 doing
 tasks


for
 computers
 today
 you
 have
 to
 go
 call


an
 Uber
 you
 might
 say
 something
 as


simple
 as
 I
 have
 a
 meeting
 at
 10:00


there
 get
 me
 there
 on
 time
 and
 that


means
 first
 knowing
 where
 that
 is


looking
 up
 my
 calend
 saying
 I
 have
 to


get
 to
 San
 Francisco
 to
 to
 this


particular
 address
 checking
 traffic
 how


long
 will
 it
 take
 determining
 when
 I


should
 leave
 calling
 me
 in
 Uber
 to
 make


sure
 it
 shows
 up
 on
 time
 uh
 all
 those


are
 tasks
 that
 an
 agent
 could
 do
 for
 me


um
 or
 it
 could
 be
 be
 as
 simple
 as
 uh
 I


want
 a
 personalized
 exercise
 program


design
 one
 for
 me
 who
 would
 own
 this


agent
 I
 think
 it's
 independent
 companies


I
 saw
 a
 company
 yesterday
 that's


designing
 physical
 programs
 for
 people


individually
 they
 started
 by
 having


physical
 trainers
 who
 are
 experts
 in


their
 area
 design
 individual
 programs


and
 you
 could


support
 10
 or
 20
 consumers
 per
 trainer


doing
 an
 hour
 of
 training
 a
 week
 or


something
 now
 they're
 up
 to
 150
 people


per
 trainer
 why
 because
 AI
 starts
 to
 do


much
 of
 the
 training
 program
 design


under
 the
 supervision
 of
 the
 physical


trainer
 and
 for
 the
 next
 decade
 we
 will


see
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 imagine
 a
 software


program
 that's
 an
 intern
 to
 a
 senior


programmer
 imagine
 a
 physician
 AI
 intern


that's
 a
 pH
 intern
 to
 a
 to
 an
 expert
 AI


doctor
 and
 so
 we
 will
 see
 this


supervised
 release
 of
 AI
 for
 the
 next


decade
 maybe
 five
 years
 and
 then
 these


start
 to
 be
 good
 enough
 and
 more


importantly
 us
 humans
 have
 more


confidence
 in
 their


capability
 and
 we
 let
 them
 do
 more
 and


more
 so
 I
 think
 it'll
 be
 a
 gradual


introduction
 of
 these
 under
 human


supervision
 I
 also
 mentioned
 one
 other


thing
 I
 use
 the
 word
 probable
 um
 are


capable
 we
 will
 have
 these
 capabilities


but
 some
 societies
 will
 oppose
 them
 when


the
 Looms
 for
 textile
 U
 making
 textiles


was
 were
 introduced
 people
 oppos
 them
 um


most
 new
 technology
 has
 been
 opposed
 and


whether
 the
 incumbents
 who
 get


short-term
 harm
 like
 a
 job
 replaced
 by
 a


robot
 let
 that
 happen
 or
 not
 uh
 is
 going


to
 be
 a
 major
 determinant
 of
 the
 pace


whether
 this
 takes
 five
 years
 10
 years


or
 25
 years
 to
 happen
 some
 societies


will
 introduce
 them
 faster
 than
 others


and
 they
 will
 make
 economic
 progress


faster
 than
 others
 others
 will
 focus
 on


we
 have
 to
 preserve
 jobs
 which
 I
 think


will
 be
 a
 losing
 battle
 and
 countries


that
 do
 that
 will


lose
 uh
 the
 economic
 race
 uh
 because
 our


higher
 cost
 structure
 but
 it'll
 be
 an


important
 issue
 how
 Society
 introduces
 I


think
 policy
 will
 be
 the
 single
 biggest


determinant
 of
 the
 rate
 of
 introduction


of
 these
 so
 governments
 will
 matter


democ
 atic
 process
 will
 matter
 long-term


views
 will
 matter
 I
 in
 fact
 worry
 China


may
 have
 a
 very
 different
 tanaman
 Square


type
 approach
 to
 introducing
 these


Technologies
 um
 and
 other
 countries
 may


have
 much
 more
 of
 a
 democratic
 process


where
 we
 recently
 saw
 the
 Screen
 Actors


Guild
 in


Hollywood
 oppose
 the
 use
 of
 AI
 generated


content
 that's
 a
 good
 example
 in
 instead


of
 saying
 we
 will
 leverage
 that
 content


we'll
 be
 the
 we'll
 use
 it
 as
 a
 creative


tool
 to
 expand
 what
 we
 can
 do
 and
 expand


infinitely
 entertainment
 available
 to


people
 uh
 they
 chose
 to
 oppose
 it


because
 it
 was
 short-term
 jobs
 it's
 a


real
 concern
 I
 I'm
 pretty
 empathetic
 to


the
 people
 who
 are
 disrupted
 whenever


you're
 trying
 to
 disrupt
 the
 world
 you


say
 that
 you
 think
 AI
 will
 will
 play
 a


larger
 role
 in
 entertainment
 and
 design


almost
 certainly
 I
 saw
 a
 tweet
 yesterday


two
 days
 ago
 by
 an
 artist
 who


said
 oh
 I
 just
 use
 AI
 to
 finish
 my
 music


I
 have
 so
 much
 unfinished
 music
 90%
 of


my
 music
 is
 music
 I
 didn't
 finish
 now
 ai


can
 help
 me
 finish
 it
 and
 release
 it


music
 for
 example
 can
 become
 interactive


you
 know
 take
 a
 simple
 entertainment


area
 like
 video
 games
 they've
 grown
 a


lot
 they
 were
 tiny
 fraction
 20
 years
 ago


compared
 to
 Hollywood
 or
 film
 and


traditional
 video
 um
 and
 audio
 music
 uh


they've
 become
 much
 larger
 than
 music
 as


an
 industry
 why
 because
 it's
 much
 more


interactive
 and
 humans
 like
 interactive


could
 music
 become
 interactive
 where


every
 person
 mixes
 their
 own
 music
 to


their
 preference
 absolutely
 so
 we
 can
 be


Lites
 about
 it
 and
 look
 retrospectively


and
 resist
 change
 or
 expand
 the
 repor
 in


fact
 most
 music
 today
 is
 produced
 very


differently
 than
 it
 was
 in
 the
 early
 90s


when
 we
 didn't
 have
 digital
 music
 we


didn't
 have
 stems
 we
 didn't
 have
 music


to
 mix
 uh
 you
 know
 what's
 happened
 in


music
 is
 the
 same
 that's
 happened
 in


software
 open
 source
 contributions
 that


people
 can
 mix
 and
 match
 and
 create
 new


music
 out
 of
 or
 even
 build
 their
 own


Library
 so
 every
 song
 isn't
 a
 fresh
 song


do
 you
 think
 it
 will
 be
 better
 music


it'll
 be
 better
 music
 it'll
 be
 more


diverse
 music


cater
 to
 a
 larger
 range
 range
 of
 users


and
 for
 particular
 purpose
 you
 know
 if


I'm
 getting
 ready
 to
 compete
 in
 the


Olympics
 and
 I
 want
 to
 get
 all
 energized


it'll
 be
 different
 music
 I
 want
 than
 if


on
 a
 Sunday
 morning
 I
 just
 want
 to
 relax


and
 meditate
 I'll
 have
 personal
 music


and
 in
 fact
 it'll
 be
 able
 to
 read
 my


brain
 signals
 and
 say
 uh
 what
 what
 kind


of
 music
 would
 calm
 me
 down
 uh
 I
 use


this
 every
 night
 last
 night
 before
 going


to
 bed
 I
 use
 a
 device
 that
 actually


measures
 my
 brain
 activity
 and
 says


based
 on
 this
 Baseline
 I'm
 going
 to


stimulate
 your
 brain
 for
 10
 minutes
 it's


it's
 like
 brushing
 your
 teeth
 I
 brush
 my


brain
 too
 and
 it
 stimulates
 my
 brain
 for


the
 theta
 waves
 the
 low
 frequency
 waves


that
 result
 in
 better
 sleep
 and
 so
 when


I
 brush
 my
 brain
 this
 way
 with


electrical
 measurement
 and
 stimulation


and
 for
 10
 minutes
 before
 I
 go
 to
 bed
 I


sleep
 better
 so
 music
 can
 do
 the
 same


we'll
 have
 personalized
 music
 generated


for
 each
 person
 and
 we
 will
 still
 have


Kayla
 Swift
 and
 the
 celebrities
 of
 the


world
 then
 we'll
 still
 have
 even
 more


diverse
 range
 of
 what
 is
 classical
 music


people
 will
 have
 a
 lot
 more
 Choice
 what


about
 the
 tailor
 making
 of
 medicine
 you


talk
 about
 the
 signs
 of
 medicine


changing
 as
 well
 we
 are
 already
 doing
 it


you
 know
 cancer
 is
 a


large
 uh
 problem
 in
 the
 world
 of
 course


in
 human
 health
 um
 with
 very
 few
 really


effect
 Ive
 Solutions
 we
 can
 delay
 death


a
 little
 bit
 but
 if
 you
 could
 tailor


design
 a
 protein
 to
 interfere
 with
 that


cancer
 one
 person's
 cancer
 not
 a
 drug


approved
 for
 all
 seven
 billion
 people
 on


the
 planet
 which
 is
 how
 we
 approve
 drugs


and
 each
 cancer
 is
 different
 each


person's
 disease
 and
 genetics
 are


different
 uh
 we
 will
 be
 able
 to
 custom


design
 it
 in
 fact
 we
 have
 a
 come
 uh


company
 called
 N1
 bio
 the
 idea
 is
 the


population
 side
 for
 the
 Target
 drugs
 is


one
 person
 N1
 n
 equal
 to
 one
 so
 it's


starting
 to
 happen
 I
 think
 drugs
 take


longer
 so
 I
 expect
 it'll
 be
 10
 15
 years


before
 that
 becomes
 more
 of
 a
 paradigm


but
 absolutely
 AI
 will
 let
 us
 design


drugs
 predictably
 for
 one
 person's


cancer
 what
 about
 food
 what
 will
 you
 do


to
 food
 the
 food
 we
 eat
 will
 be
 the
 food


we
 eat
 but
 can
 we
 produce
 it
 with
 a
 lot


less
 chemicals
 for
 example
 absolutely


because
 uh
 robots
 can
 pick
 bugs
 off


trees
 instead
 of
 bombarding
 them
 with


pesticides
 or


herbicides
 um
 so
 we
 are
 already
 doing
 it


we
 are
 doing
 strawberries
 and
 other


things
 in
 green
 houses
 completely
 done


with


robots
 uh
 that
 can
 control
 it
 and


precisely
 control
 temperature
 fertilizer


for
 each
 plant
 produce
 much
 sweeter


strawberries
 uh
 so
 there's
 a
 particular


class
 of
 Korean
 strawberries
 that
 are


almost
 never
 grown
 because
 they're
 too


expensive
 to
 grow
 because
 they
 need


detail
 care
 we
 are
 routinely
 producing


them
 I
 do
 think
 AI
 will
 have
 less
 an


impact
 on
 agriculture
 but
 I've
 just


given
 you
 some
 examples
 we
 had
 a
 company


that
 John
 Deere
 B
 that
 drove
 through


fields
 and
 custom
 sprayed
 herbicide
 on


each
 weed
 after
 reading
 each
 plant
 with


an
 IM
 as
 through
 a
 camera
 saying
 this


identifying
 it
 as
 the
 weed
 and
 killing


it
 one
 weed
 at
 a
 time
 instead
 of


spraying
 the
 field
 with
 P


herbicides
 and
 the
 same
 applies
 to


pesticides
 that's
 a
 good
 example
 of
 how


you
 change
 agriculture
 of
 course
 you
 can


fertilize
 individually
 also
 each
 plant


because
 their
 needs
 may
 be
 different


will
 we
 have
 a
 cars
 in
 our
 cities
 I


believe
 cars
 were
 a
 great
 addition
 to


humanity
 most
 cities
 are
 too
 congested


and
 today
 only
 about
 200
 of
 the
 4,000


cities
 on
 the
 planet
 that
 should
 have


public
 transit
 have
 public
 transit
 why


because
 it's
 very
 expensive
 on
 capex


very
 inconvenient
 for
 the
 user
 and
 the


less
 the
 usage
 the
 less
 frequent
 the


schedule
 to
 make
 the
 economics
 work
 and


then
 people
 don't
 want
 to
 use
 it
 I
 do


believe


self-driving
 will
 introduce
 two
 person


public
 transit
 Vehicles
 sort
 of


personalized
 public
 transit
 going
 point


to
 point
 so
 it
 never
 stops
 where
 other


people
 have
 to
 get
 off
 because
 you're


not
 sharing
 the
 vehicle
 and
 you
 avoided


the
 cost
 of
 the
 driver
 so
 we
 go
 from
 a


van
 to
 a
 bus
 to
 a
 double
 decker
 bus
 to


light
 rail
 to
 heavy
 rail


because
 there's
 a
 person
 driving
 the


vehicle
 and
 so
 we
 go
 to
 larger
 and


larger
 aggregation
 which
 results
 in
 more


stops
 along
 the
 way
 because
 there's
 more


people
 on
 our


train
 and
 slower
 Transit
 time
 less


convenient


schedules
 we
 are
 designing
 a
 system
 now


in
 state
 California
 in
 fact
 in
 four


different
 cities
 we
 have
 won
 contracts


to
 build
 public
 transit
 as
 a
 startup


where
 the
 idea
 is
 it
 will
 be
 point
 to


point
 like
 an
 Uber
 and
 it
 won't
 stop


anywhere
 along
 the
 way
 not
 even
 traffic


lights
 so
 it
 will
 be
 faster
 than
 a


chauffeur
 driven
 car
 because
 it
 won't
 be


in
 congestion
 it
 won't
 stop
 at
 stop


lights
 it'll
 go
 point
 to
 point
 if
 you


get
 off
 your
 restaurant
 job
 at
 1:00
 a.m.


it
 it
 will
 be
 there
 for
 you
 far
 as
 a


personal
 vehicle
 to
 take
 you
 to
 the
 stop


where
 you
 want
 to
 go
 without
 stopping


anywhere
 else
 um
 I'm
 very
 excited
 about


this
 I
 think
 at
 some
 point
 once
 we
 prove


this
 out
 and
 I
 think
 we'll
 in
 the
 next


five
 years
 we
 will
 have
 enough
 systems


implemented
 that
 every
 city
 will
 go
 to


this
 kind
 of
 an
 idea
 and
 cars
 in
 cities


will
 decline
 of
 course
 there'll
 be
 cars


but
 my
 bet
 is
 most
 cars
 greater
 than
 50%


in
 most
 cities
 will
 be


eliminated
 by
 2050
 or
 so
 I
 have
 to
 say
 I


have
 very
 good
 throughput
 with
 my


electric
 scooter
 which
 I
 Ed
 to
 to
 work


every
 day
 but
 hey
 but
 on
 AG
 but
 what


about
 what
 about
 fly
 agregate
 if


everybody
 was
 using
 the
 scooter
 the


througho
 per
 hour
 or
 the
 streets
 you


drive
 would
 be
 lower
 than
 if
 you
 had
 a


public
 transit
 system
 doing


self-driving
 uh
 little
 pods
 if
 you
 might


imagine
 that
 yeah
 yeah
 now
 I
 can
 see


that
 what
 about
 flying
 you
 think
 we'll


fly
 a
 lot
 faster
 yeah
 you
 know
 after
 the


Concord
 we
 gave
 up
 flying
 faster
 and


this
 speed
 of
 sound
 was
 the
 limit
 for


most
 aircraft
 fly
 other
 than
 specialty


aircraft
 for
 the
 military
 and
 Hypersonic


missiles
 and
 things
 like
 that
 we
 will


get
 there
 and
 I
 think
 we're
 working
 on


that
 U
 that
 probably
 doesn't
 have
 a
 lot


to
 do
 with
 AI
 but
 AI
 will
 help
 in


Material
 Science
 design
 of
 materials
 I


think
 it
 can
 be
 done
 with
 very


traditional
 engineering
 today
 and
 it


just
 nobody
 has
 taken
 on
 that
 challenge


to
 say
 we
 can
 fly
 at
 Mark
 5
 4,000
 mil


hour
 or
 6,000
 kilometers
 per
 hour
 uh


that's
 that'd
 be
 exciting
 it
 make
 the


world
 a
 shorter
 place
 you
 could
 go
 from


London
 to
 New
 York
 for
 lunch
 and
 back


clean
 power
 you
 are
 also
 a
 strong


believer
 in
 nuclear
 fusion
 um
 how
 do
 you


see
 this
 Well
 Fusion
 hasn't
 worked


because
 no
 Ono
 has
 worked
 we've
 had
 the


itar
 project
 and
 started
 with
 the


assumption
 it
 would
 take
 20
 years
 and
 25


years
 coordinated
 between
 a
 lot
 of


Nations
 a
 huge
 bureaucracy
 what
 has


happened
 since
 2018
 and
 it
 is


interesting
 in
 2018
 we
 decide
 to
 invest


in
 open
 ey
 and
 we
 also
 decide
 to
 invest


in
 Commonwealth
 fusion
 and
 it
 made


Fusion
 real
 now
 there's
 a
 dozen
 startups


that
 are
 credible
 startups
 in
 Fusion
 so


I'm
 very
 optimistic
 in
 the
 next
 5
 years


no
 will
 doubt
 that
 Fusion
 is
 a
 viable


technology
 and
 then
 we'll
 have
 the
 30s


and
 40s
 to
 scale
 it
 up
 and
 scaling
 up
 is


much
 faster
 My
 Hope
 for
 Fusion
 is
 we
 use


current
 power
 plants
 but
 replace
 coal


boilers
 and
 natural
 gas
 boilers
 with


Fusion
 boilers
 we
 may
 need
 to
 replace


the
 turbine
 too
 but
 retrofit
 old
 plants


with
 Fusion
 clean
 power
 much


cheaper
 much
 cleaner
 and
 of
 course
 much


more


scalable
 because
 you're
 not
 needing
 more


coal
 or
 more
 natural
 gas
 has
 very
 little


input
 so
 then
 energy
 will
 be
 free
 too


basically
 you're
 free
 I
 hope
 well
 energy


is
 interesting
 already
 if
 you
 have
 a


large
 solar
 facility
 in
 India
 you
 can


get
 a
 contract
 for


$1.7
 per
 kilowatt
 cents
 per
 kilowatt


hour
 of
 electricity
 per
 unit
 of


electricity
 that's
 pretty
 close


frame
 um
 you
 know
 in
 many
 parts
 of
 the


world
 they're
 paying
 10
 times
 that
 today


now
 solar
 power
 is
 not
 reliable
 or


dispatchable
 you
 want
 to
 watch
 the
 game


when
 the
 game
 is
 on
 not
 when
 the
 Sun's


shining
 or
 the
 wind's
 blowing
 so
 we
 need


to
 stabilize
 energy
 I'm
 pretty


optimistic
 that
 Fusion
 will
 solve
 that


problem
 battery
 storage
 can
 help
 solar


and
 wind
 scale
 and
 I
 do
 believe


geothermal
 super
 hot
 geothermal
 is


another
 area
 we've
 not
 done
 enough


working
 that
 will
 provide
 very
 low
 cost


sustainable
 Renewable
 Power
 and
 uh
 and


more
 uh
 optimistic
 predictions
 resources


will
 be
 plentiful
 and
 carbon
 will
 find


Solutions
 you
 predicted
 peak
 oil
 in
 the


1960s
 and
 what
 happened
 is
 at
 the
 right


price
 of
 oil
 people
 W
 looking
 for
 oil


and
 we
 discovered
 a
 lot
 more
 oil
 than
 we


imagined
 we
 are
 in
 minerals
 like
 lithium


copper
 Cobalt
 where
 we
 were
 in
 1960
 SE


in
 oil
 we've
 only
 looked
 on
 the
 surface


in
 very
 traditional
 ways
 I
 don't
 believe


we've
 developed
 the
 sensors
 to
 go
 look
 a


kilometer
 or
 two
 under
 the
 Earth
 but


those
 are
 entirely
 possible
 I
 don't


think
 we've
 used
 AI
 to
 start
 looking
 for


minerals
 and
 so
 my
 bet
 is
 the
 next
 five


seven
 years
 is
 about
 developing
 the


tools
 to
 go
 look
 and
 then
 we
 will


discover
 more


minerals
 uh
 once
 we
 have
 the
 tools
 to


find
 them
 much
 better
 and
 there
 won't
 be


a
 shortage
 we'll
 also
 learn
 recycling
 in


unusual
 ways
 uh
 and
 so
 I'm
 pretty


optimistic
 that
 if
 I
 look
 in
 20
 years


the
 things
 we
 think
 will
 be
 short
 copper


lithium
 high
 and
 over
 of
 course
 um
 one


we
 will
 learn
 to
 use
 them
 much
 much


better
 with
 AI
 you
 can
 do
 structural


design
 that's
 much
 using
 much
 less


steel
 um
 much
 less
 um
 copper
 but
 we
 will


discover
 more
 minerals
 and
 I
 don't


believe
 in
 20
 years
 we'll
 be
 talking


about
 a
 mineral
 shortage
 we
 will
 be


talking
 about
 a
 mineral
 glut
 you
 paint


um
 a
 very
 positive
 uh
 picture
 of
 the


world
 here
 and
 you
 mentioned
 earlier


some
 of
 the
 things
 which
 could
 hold
 this


uh
 back
 from
 happening
 um
 which
 part
 of


the
 world
 is
 going
 to
 benefit
 most
 from


these
 Trends
 and
 where
 will
 there
 be
 the


biggest
 uh
 obstacles
 for
 achieving
 these


things
 so
 the
 one
 thing
 to
 keep
 in
 mind


is
 these
 things
 are


relatively
 unpredictable
 I
 go
 back
 to


the


improbable
 I'd
 say
 any
 one
 location
 if


you
 ask
 me
 about
 a
 country
 uh
 that
 it
 is


extremely
 improbable
 it'd
 be
 that


country
 but
 I
 always
 say
 we
 don't
 know


which
 improbable
 is


important
 but
 among
 a
 thousand


improbable
 some
 improbable
 is
 very


probable
 and
 so
 the
 mistake
 we
 made
 in


looking
 at
 one
 thing
 and
 saying
 that's


improbable
 is
 not
 realizing
 there's
 a


thousand
 possibilities
 thousand


improbables
 one
 of
 which
 will
 become
 the


probable
 thing
 that
 changes
 the
 world
 so


will
 minerals
 be
 discovered
 in
 the


Himalayas
 uh
 possible
 but
 I
 couldn't


predict
 that
 it
 could
 be
 under
 the
 ocean


it
 could
 be
 in
 in
 the
 deserts
 in


California
 uh
 so


this
 is
 the
 reason
 I
 focus
 so
 much
 on


the
 improbable
 and
 creating
 many
 more


improbables
 in
 in
 haky
 terms
 more
 shots


on
 goal
 or
 soccer
 any
 any
 sport
 if
 you


have
 more
 shots
 on
 goal
 one
 of
 those


improvable
 shots
 will
 score
 for
 you
 and


that
 is
 the
 approach
 we
 have
 to
 take
 not


the
 approach
 experts
 say
 prove
 to
 me
 the


path
 exists
 in
 a
 particular
 place
 or
 a


country
 and
 this
 is
 very
 important
 in


realizing


why
 most
 of
 the
 innovation
 has
 come
 from


Silicon
 Valley
 it's
 an
 attitude
 towards


making
 the
 improbable
 happen
 taking
 the


improbable
 making
 it


possible
 then
 probable
 and
 then
 making


it
 happen
 it's
 this
 journey
 from
 high


uncertainty
 to
 high


certainty
 you
 know
 nobody
 imagined
 the


world
 of
 Google
 or
 the
 media
 companies


you
 know


YouTube
 Twitter


mattera
 they
 weren't
 didn't
 even
 know


they
 were
 in
 the
 media
 business
 when


traditional
 broadcasters
 were
 looking
 at


media
 but
 they
 are
 the
 dominant
 media


companies
 now
 at
 least
 by
 market
 cap
 so


this
 is
 how
 one
 has
 to
 take
 think
 about


this
 world
 of
 invention
 and
 Innovation


and
 allowing
 lots
 of
 things
 to
 fail
 I


like
 to
 say
 I
 don't
 mind
 a
 90%
 chance
 of


failure
 on
 a
 project
 if
 there's
 a
 10%
 %


chance
 I
 change
 the
 world
 and
 in
 this


world
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 young


people
 look
 each
 person's
 different
 20


years
 from
 now
 I'll
 be
 telling
 them


pursue
 your
 passions
 I
 used
 to
 say


pursue
 your
 passions
 as
 long
 as
 you
 can


make
 a
 living
 at
 it
 I'll
 drop
 the
 as


long
 as
 you
 can
 make
 a
 living
 at
 it


because
 I
 think
 there'll
 be
 enough


abundance
 in
 society
 for
 societies
 to


support
 uh
 a
 minimum
 level
 of
 living
 for


everybody
 independent
 of
 the
 job
 people


kids
 at
 six
 years
 old
 won't
 be
 taught
 to


study
 so
 they
 can
 get
 a
 job
 it'll
 be


study
 so
 you
 can
 explore
 your
 interests


or
 pursue
 your
 passions
 I
 think
 it'll
 be


a
 different
 kind
 of
 world
 that's
 my


advice
 to
 young
 people
 uh
 one
 generation


past
 the
 generation
 of
 young
 people


today
 these
 people
 in
 the
 middle
 will


have
 a
 hard
 transition
 as
 we
 lose
 jobs


as
 Jobs


transition
 um
 it'll
 be
 hard
 the


disruption
 is
 hard
 um
 the
 rate
 of
 change


will
 my
 bet
 slow
 down
 because
 of
 this


disruption
 and
 how
 disruptive
 it
 can
 be


on
 people
 who
 but
 abundance
 if
 he
 can


change
 the
 world
 from
 2%
 GDP
 growth
 to


five
 or
 6%
 there
 will
 be
 enough


abundance
 in
 50
 years
 and
 we
 can
 do
 the


math
 for
 GDP
 growth
 rates
 at
 those
 and


per
 capita
 income
 growth
 rates
 at
 those


levels
 It's
 a
 Wonderful
 World
 we
 can
 be


in
 the
 transition
 will
 be
 hard
 it'll
 be


difficult
 it'll
 depend
 on
 government


policies
 but
 in
 democracy
 those
 policies


will
 be
 determined


by
 uh
 by
 voters
 and
 I
 think
 we
 will
 need


things
 like
 Universal
 basic
 income
 in


other
 things
 and
 we
 will
 have
 the


resources
 to
 afford
 them
 very
 hard
 to


imagine
 today
 very
 improbable
 that
 we


can
 afford
 Universal
 basic
 income
 in
 any


society
 but
 I
 think
 it'll
 be
 possible


wonderful
 um
 it's
 been
 really
 really


great
 uh
 talking
 to
 you
 uh
 all
 the
 best


of
 luck
 and
 uh
 keep
 up
 the
 good
 work


thank
 you
 very
 much
 it's
 great
 to
 talk


to
 you
