[Music]


good
 afternoon
 everybody
 it's
 really


great
 to
 be
 with
 you
 the
 goal
 of
 my


session
 is
 to
 talk
 about
 two
 very


specific
 blocks
 to
 potentially
 poor


decisions
 and
 what
 the
 best
 investors
 do


to
 overcome
 them
 the
 goal
 of
 session
 two


is
 to
 be
 very
 practical
 I
 hope
 when
 you


go
 back
 to
 your
 desks
 you'll
 immediately


be
 able
 to
 implement
 some
 of
 these
 ideas


and
 ultimately
 make
 better


decisions
 Adam
 Grant
 mentioned
 earlier


today
 the
 good
 judgment
 project
 a


project
 at
 University
 of
 Pennsylvania
 on


forecasting
 turns
 out
 they
 did
 something


very
 interesting
 when
 forecasters
 uh


volunteered
 to
 participate
 in
 their


project
 they
 either
 uh
 in
 control
 gave


them
 no
 training
 or
 they
 gave
 them
 some


training
 and
 the
 question
 was
 did
 the


training
 make
 them
 better
 at
 making


better
 forecasts
 and
 the
 answer
 to
 that


was
 yes
 but
 it's
 actually
 somewhat


qualified
 there
 are
 different
 flavors
 of


training
 that
 have
 different
 impacts
 the


first
 is
 just
 giving
 people
 information


about


hertica
 what
 they
 were
 doing
 before
 so


it
 doesn't
 change
 any
 Behavior
 the
 two


that
 we
 want
 to
 focus
 on
 is
 process
 so


very
 specific
 tools
 and
 techniques
 we


can
 um
 work
 on
 to
 uncover
 biases
 and


then
 finally
 giving
 people
 feedback


certainly
 a
 theme
 that's
 come
 through
 a


lot
 today
 there
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 on


format
 so
 how
 you
 can
 reframe
 problems


I'll
 give
 you
 one
 example
 that's
 a


little
 bit
 in
 that
 in
 that
 flavor
 but


we're
 going
 to
 focus
 mostly
 on
 process


and


feedback
 so
 let's
 jump
 into
 this
 I
 think


the
 first
 very
 big
 barrier
 to
 making


good
 decisions
 is
 the
 notion
 of


overconfidence
 and
 I
 think
 the
 best


investors
 are
 are
 very
 good
 at


overcoming


this
 now
 it
 turns
 out
 overconfidence


which
 is
 often
 considered
 the
 root
 of


all
 problems
 comes
 again
 in
 different


varieties
 the
 first
 I'll
 say
 to
 the
 very


bottom
 is
 this
 idea
 of
 overplacement


people
 think
 of
 themselves
 is
 better


than
 they
 are
 versus
 others
 so
 you've


all
 heard
 this
 you
 know
 I'm
 above


average
 driver
 my
 sense
 of
 humor
 is


better
 than
 90%
 of
 other
 people
 the


other
 is
 idea
 of
 overestimation
 which


people
 absolutely
 think
 they're
 better


at
 certain
 tasks
 you
 know
 so
 I
 can
 make


this
 seven
 foot
 foot
 put
 or
 whatever
 it


is
 so
 overplacement
 but
 the
 one
 that


we're
 most
 interested
 in
 I
 think
 is
 this


concept
 of
 over


Precision
 we
 actually
 think
 we


understand
 the
 future
 better
 than
 we


actually
 do
 and
 I
 think
 the
 really
 good


investors
 are
 those
 that
 can
 combat
 and


overcome
 that


let
 me
 give
 you
 an
 example
 of
 how
 this


works
 this
 is
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 test
 of


calibration
 in
 some
 degree
 a
 test
 of


overconfidence
 um
 by
 the
 way
 the
 URL
 is


down
 there
 if
 you
 can't
 find
 it
 or
 to


see
 it
 just
 let
 me
 know
 it's
 a
 very
 fun


exercise
 to
 do
 in
 your
 own
 organization


or
 with
 your
 loved


ones
 it's


a
 it's
 50
 true
 false
 questions
 some
 of


which
 you'll
 know
 the
 answer
 to
 many
 of


which
 you
 will
 not
 know
 the
 answer
 to
 so


you
 answer
 true
 false
 and
 then
 you
 give


a
 confidence
 100%
 means
 I
 know
 the


answer
 to
 this
 question
 50%
 means
 I


don't
 know
 the
 answer
 answer
 and
 I'm


guessing
 right
 so
 this
 is
 the
 basic


setup
 now
 we've
 had
 now
 about
 20,000


people
 do
 this
 exercise
 and
 this
 is
 the


scatter
 plot
 of
 all
 the
 responses
 by
 the


way
 I
 do
 want
 to
 mention
 two
 and
 I'm


sure
 they're
 guys
 I'm
 going
 to
 mention


two
 guys
 that
 are
 my
 two
 favorite
 dots


the
 one
 is
 the
 upper
 right
 hand
 corner


which
 is
 100%
 correct
 and
 100%
 confident


so
 this
 this
 guy
 Googled
 everyone
 and


like
 the
 second
 guy
 that
 was
 even
 better


is
 in
 the
 bottom
 right
 hand
 corner
 who


his
 35%
 correct
 and
 95%
 confident
 you


just
 hit
 true
 true
 true
 true
 you
 do


better
 than
 that
 guy


did
 now
 the
 goal
 of
 this
 exercise
 not
 to


be
 right
 about
 every
 question
 if
 you
 can


be
 right
 that's
 great
 but
 the
 goal
 of


the
 exercise
 as
 you
 might
 imagine
 is
 to


know
 what
 you
 know
 and
 to
 know
 what
 you


don't
 know
 the
 goal
 of
 the
 exercise
 is


to
 lie
 as
 close
 to
 the
 45
 degree
 angle


line
 as
 possible
 now
 even
 people
 in
 the


very
 back
 in
 the
 room
 can
 probably
 see


this
 when
 I
 give
 you
 the
 numbers
 you


won't
 be
 shocked
 to
 hear
 this
 the


average
 confidence
 is
 70%
 and
 the


average
 correct
 is
 about
 60%
 people
 are


10
 percentage
 points
 overconfident
 in


their
 own
 judgments
 now
 let's
 unpack


that
 a
 little
 bit
 to
 see
 if
 there's


anything
 interesting
 well
 the
 first
 is


the
 distribution
 of
 overconfidence


versus
 underconfidence
 by
 the
 way
 I


mentioned
 this
 10%
 overconfidence
 it


turns
 out
 the
 the
 the
 standard


deviations
 also
 tend
 so
 it's
 a
 beautiful


shaped
 Bell
 distribution
 when
 you
 have


this
 many
 people
 and
 about
 82
 82
 or
 83%


of
 people
 are
 overconfident
 that's


something
 we
 see
 very
 consistently
 by


the
 way
 as
 a
 side
 note
 and
 I'm
 glad


you're
 all
 sitting
 to
 hear
 the
 this


information
 men
 tend
 to
 be
 more


overconfident
 than


women
 and
 young
 men
 tend
 to
 be
 more
 over


confident
 than
 older
 men
 so
 there's
 some


patterns
 there
 now
 this
 is
 where
 it
 gets


really
 interesting
 it
 turns
 out
 that
 uh


how
 do
 people
 answer
 when
 they're
 doing


this
 exercise
 right
 so
 again
 you're


getting
 50%
 means
 I'm
 guess
 I
 don't
 know


the
 answer
 to
 100%
 so
 it
 turns
 out
 when


people
 don't
 know
 the
 answer
 they
 they


know
 they
 don't
 know
 the
 answer
 and
 they


answer
 they
 don't
 answer
 so
 they're


actually
 pretty
 they
 about
 40%
 of
 the


aners
 is
 I
 don't
 know
 which
 is
 fine


what's
 fascinating
 is
 the
 second
 most


common
 response
 is
 I've
 got
 this
 I'm


100%
 sure
 I
 know
 the
 answer
 so
 between
 I


have
 no
 idea
 what's
 going
 on
 and
 I
 know


the
 answers
 about
 two-thirds
 of
 all


responses
 and
 people
 are
 very
 sparing
 in


using
 those
 intermediate
 ranges
 by
 the


way
 as
 Adam's
 talking
 about
 super


forecasters
 he
 alluded
 to
 this
 but
 super


forecasters
 are
 much
 better
 at
 updating


their
 views
 and
 being
 more
 uh
 granular


and
 actually
 setting
 their


forecasts
 okay
 so
 how
 do
 people
 do
 given


their
 confidence
 well
 this
 is
 the
 most


fascinating
 chart
 turns
 out
 when
 people


don't
 know
 the
 answer
 again
 they
 don't


they
 answer
 they
 don't
 answer
 and


they're
 pretty
 well
 calibrated
 at
 I


don't
 know
 but
 as
 you
 move
 from
 left
 to


right
 on
 this
 chart
 you
 see
 this


systematic
 departure
 from
 the
 45
 degree


angle
 line
 when
 people
 are
 100%
 sure


they
 know
 the
 answer
 they're
 only
 right


77%
 of
 the
 time
 when
 they
 are
 90%
 sure


they're
 only
 right
 2third
 of
 the
 time


right
 there's
 this
 yawning
 Gap


especially
 in
 this
 range
 of
 I'm
 very


sure
 what's
 going
 on
 Howard
 Mar
 remarked


about
 this
 just
 this
 morning
 that
 this


is
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 Mark
 Twain
 thing
 when


you're
 very
 confident
 about
 something


you're
 wrong
 about
 it
 this
 is
 where


trouble
 can
 can
 arise
 this
 is
 also
 very


very
 important
 for
 uh
 portfolio


construction


concepts
 by
 the
 way
 there's
 an


interesting
 uh
 just
 this
 there's
 a
 brand


new
 paper
 about
 this
 but
 there's
 a
 new


survey
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 group
 called


the
 survey
 of
 professional
 uh


forecasters
 that
 forecast
 economic


things
 so
 this
 is
 unemployment
 rates
 and


interest
 rates
 and
 so
 forth
 and
 they


have
 a
 data
 set
 going
 back
 to
 1968
 so
 55


or
 60
 years
 data
 on
 this
 and
 it's
 the


exact
 same
 thing
 they
 say
 what's
 going


to
 happen
 with
 this
 thing
 with
 some
 sort


of
 probability
 and
 here
 again
 these
 are


professional
 forecasters
 and
 here
 you


see
 this
 exact
 same
 pattern


unfold
 high
 confidence
 uh
 poor


conviction
 now
 why
 is
 this
 uh
 you
 know


what's
 it
 what's
 exciting
 about
 this
 on


the
 other
 hand
 is
 uh
 going
 back
 to
 the


concept
 of
 feedback
 is
 it
 turns
 out
 when


people
 get
 feedback
 on
 their
 forecast


they
 get
 better
 at
 it
 over
 time
 so
 this


is
 a
 picture
 of
 actually
 other


forecasters
 the
 the
 line
 the
 line
 at
 the


bottom
 is
 actually
 the
 first
 year
 they


did
 this
 these
 are
 large
 sample
 sizes


and
 then
 the
 next
 year
 they
 repeated
 the


exercise
 with
 the
 feedback
 from
 the


first
 year
 and
 you
 can
 see
 they
 got


marketly
 better
 so
 this
 should
 be
 very


encouraging
 to
 all
 of
 us
 that
 if
 we


practice
 and
 get
 the
 feedback
 we
 get


better
 at
 this
 right
 but
 keeping
 track


of
 your
 decisions
 is
 really
 crucial
 to


this
 okay
 so
 what's
 going
 on
 here
 how


can
 we
 improve
 broadly
 speaker
 what
 are


the
 best
 investors
 do


uh
 Annie
 mentioned
 Danny
 Conan
 we
 all


mourn
 his
 loss
 he
 was
 extraordinary
 but


one
 of
 the
 concepts
 that
 Danny


popularized
 is
 this
 idea
 of
 the
 inside


versus
 the
 outside
 view
 see
 the
 inside


inside
 view
 says
 when
 I
 give
 you
 a


problem
 it
 could
 be
 any
 kind
 of
 problem


the
 classic
 way
 to
 solve
 this
 see
 if


this
 makes
 sense
 to
 you
 is
 you
 gather


lots
 of
 information
 you
 combine
 it
 with


your
 own


experience
 and
 then
 you
 project
 into
 the


future
 right
 left
 door
 devices
 that's


what
 we
 do
 information
 my
 experience


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 the
 world
 the


outside
 view
 by
 contrast
 says
 I'm
 going


to
 think
 about
 my
 problem
 is
 an
 instance


of
 a
 larger
 reference
 class
 I'm
 going
 to


ask
 what
 happened
 when
 other
 people
 were


in
 this
 situation
 before
 it's
 a
 very


unnatural
 way
 to
 think
 about
 the
 world


right
 because
 you
 have
 to
 leave
 aside


your
 cherish
 information
 and
 you
 have
 to


find
 an
 appeal
 to
 the
 base
 rate
 what


psychologists
 like
 conman
 have


demonstrated
 is
 some
 combination
 of
 the


inside
 and
 the
 outside
 view
 um
 lead
 to


better
 forecasts
 let
 me
 give
 you
 one


example
 from
 the
 world
 of
 business
 this


is
 pelaton
 right
 and
 this
 is
 an
 analyst


report
 that
 was
 written
 in
 September


2020
 so
 please
 roll
 your
 mind
 back
 3
 and


a
 half
 years
 to
 the
 middle
 of
 the


pandemic
 they
 were
 doing
 they
 were
 doing


great
 because
 everybody
 wanted
 to


exercise
 while
 they
 were
 at
 home
 they


had
 just
 come
 finished
 a
 blockbuster


year
 2020
 and
 the
 analyst
 wrote
 in
 his


report
 that
 our
 base
 case
 scenario
 is


they're
 going
 to
 grow
 Revenue
 30%
 for


the
 next
 decade
 and
 by
 the
 way
 it's
 a


very
 I
 mean
 I'm
 tell
 the
 guy
 is
 a


serious
 model
 he's
 got
 it's
 all
 built


out
 you
 know
 it's
 like
 it's
 actually


quite
 credible
 so
 there's
 that's
 his


inside
 view
 now
 the
 question
 you
 are


going
 to
 ask
 ask
 hopefully
 using
 the


danyc
 Conan
 mindset
 is
 how
 many


companies
 with
 $2
 billion
 of
 turnover


grew
 30%
 a
 year
 for
 10
 years
 and
 here


are
 the
 data
 on


this
 I
 put
 the
 peleton
 bike
 the
 actual


the
 guy's
 forecast
 um
 but
 you
 could
 see


the
 average
 is
 about
 6%
 the
 standard


deviation
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 than
 that


this
 is
 the
 guy's
 base
 case
 so
 you
 might


say
 if
 he's
 wildly
 optimistic
 he
 should


certainly
 have
 a
 scenario
 for
 that
 but


that
 certainly
 would
 not
 be
 your
 base


case
 right
 so
 this
 gives
 you
 an
 example


of
 how
 you
 might
 temper
 that
 there's
 a


great
 quote
 from
 Danny
 conman
 by
 the
 way


which
 really
 applies
 to
 investors
 he


says
 people
 who
 know
 uh
 information


about
 their
 own
 individual
 circumstances


feel
 no
 need
 effectively
 to
 appeal
 to


the
 base
 case
 the
 reference
 class
 to


which
 it
 belongs
 right
 you
 feel
 like


I've
 done
 the
 work
 I
 don't
 need
 to
 know


what
 happened
 in
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world


when
 we
 know
 combining
 these
 two
 things


is
 very
 powerful
 so
 why
 do
 we
 do
 this
 uh


a
 few
 reasons
 one
 is
 Annie
 just


mentioned
 one
 of
 them
 one
 is
 called
 uh


three
 Illusions
 one
 is
 called
 the


illusion
 of
 superiority
 we
 tend
 to
 think


of
 ourselves
 as
 better
 than
 those
 around


us


by
 the
 way
 why
 do
 I
 have
 a
 picture
 of


Mother


Teresa
 25
 years
 ago
 US
 News
 and
 Ro


report
 did
 a
 survey
 of
 1,000
 Americans


and
 they
 said
 what's
 the
 probability
 of


going
 to
 heaven
 and
 they
 talked
 about


like
 they
 asked
 about
 Michael
 you
 know


Michael
 Jordan
 and
 all
 these
 people


anyway
 Mother
 Teresa
 scored
 79%
 which


seemed
 a
 little
 low
 to
 me
 by
 the
 way


she's
 now
 a
 saint
 so
 maybe
 people
 will


bump
 it
 up
 but
 this
 is
 the
 best
 Mother


Teresa
 79
 they
 said
 you
 uh
 survey
 answer


what
 is
 the
 probably
 will
 you
 go
 to


heaven
 87


%
 Mother
 Teresa
 I
 promise
 you
 I
 would


not
 answer
 higher
 than
 Mother
 Teresa
 um


the
 second
 is
 the
 illusion
 of
 optimism


it
 tends
 to
 be
 we
 tend
 to
 be
 very


optimistic
 about
 uh
 our
 our
 outcomes


that
 are
 important
 to
 us
 and
 so
 as
 a


consequence
 we
 tend
 to
 over
 calibrate


our
 success
 and
 then
 the
 illusion
 of


control
 this
 is
 good
 and
 when
 we
 when
 we


deem
 ourselves
 in
 control
 situation
 we


think
 our
 odds
 of
 success
 are
 much


higher
 than
 they
 are
 objectively
 uh


turns
 out
 when
 they
 go
 to
 Las
 Vegas


watch
 people
 rolling
 dice
 when
 they
 want


High
 numbers
 they
 throw
 them
 really
 hard


when
 they
 want
 low
 numbers
 they
 throw


them
 very
 gently


doesn't
 work
 by
 the
 way
 but
 just
 this


idea
 of
 being
 in
 control
 of
 the


situation
 here's
 the
 last
 thing
 I'll
 say


in
 this
 which
 you
 can
 all
 relate
 to


which
 is
 statist
 this
 is
 statistical


thinking
 and
 it
 turns
 out
 in
 the
 real


world
 what
 carries
 the
 day
 are


stories
 your
 parents
 told
 you
 stories


you
 tell
 stories
 to
 your
 children


stories
 move
 people
 stories
 teach
 people


stories
 are
 memorable
 statistics
 are
 not


so
 this
 is
 an
 interesting
 experiment


where
 they
 went
 to
 people
 and
 they
 said


you
 have
 a
 horrible
 disease
 you
 have
 a


treatment
 alternative
 it's
 always
 50
 50


so
 you
 have
 that
 in
 your
 back
 pocket
 and


then
 they
 said
 we're
 going
 to
 give
 you


or
 they're
 going
 to
 show
 you
 one
 of
 four


Alternatives
 30
 50
 70
 or
 90%
 probability


of
 success
 so
 this
 is
 you
 see
 one
 of


those
 but
 the
 key
 is
 they
 paired
 it
 with


a
 story
 that
 was
 positive
 negative
 or


neutral
 about
 someone
 like
 you
 right
 so


hopefully
 I'm
 making
 myself
 clear


everyone's
 got
 5050
 you're
 getting
 30


neutral
 K
 so
 here
 let
 me
 just
 draw
 your


attention
 to
 the
 extremes
 if
 you
 give


people
 a
 positive
 anecdote
 they
 select


the
 30%
 Effectiveness
 now
 30
 versus
 50


they
 selected
 almost
 eight
 out
 of
 10


times
 if
 you
 give
 them
 a
 negative


anecdote
 they
 select
 the
 90
 now
 90
 vers


50
 they
 select
 it
 less
 than
 four
 out
 of


10


times
 the
 stories
 swamp
 the
 statistics


and
 people
 making
 decisions
 by
 the
 way


extremely
 important
 as
 Leaders
 very


important
 for
 you
 as
 you
 think
 about


stocks
 and
 narratives
 that
 go
 around


them
 let
 me
 now
 turn
 to
 the
 second
 um


major
 problem
 this
 is
 very
 much
 involved


with
 what
 Annie
 was
 just
 talking
 about


uh
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 it's
 confirmation


bias
 confirmation
 bias
 as
 you
 all
 know


even
 if
 you
 struggle
 to
 make
 a
 decision


once
 you've
 made
 a
 decision
 you
 seek


information
 that
 confirms
 your
 point
 of


view
 and
 you
 discount
 dismiss
 or
 disavow


information
 that
 does
 not
 support
 your


point
 of
 view
 now
 there's
 a
 very


interesting
 point
 about
 confirmation


bias
 it
 turns
 out
 almost
 all
 the
 biases


heuristics
 and
 biases
 that
 are
 out
 there


that
 con
 and
 trki
 identified
 are


mitigated
 to
 some
 degree
 by
 intelligence


so
 if
 you're
 you're
 a
 smarter
 person
 on


average
 you
 learn
 about
 them
 you
 tend
 to


do
 better
 the
 one
 that
 that's
 not
 true


for
 is
 confirmation
 bias
 this
 affects


everybody
 no
 matter
 who
 they
 are
 and
 how


bright
 they


are
 2005
 was
 the
 first
 chance
 I
 ever
 had


to
 meet
 Danny
 conman
 it
 was
 an


extraordinary
 day
 an
 extraordinary


session
 at
 the
 very
 end
 of
 him
 I
 said


Danny
 if
 there's
 one
 thing
 a
 investor


can
 do
 to
 improve
 his
 or
 her
 results


what
 would
 it
 be
 without
 hesitation
 he


said
 you
 must
 keep
 a
 journal
 of
 your


decisions
 write
 down
 what
 you
 think
 is


going
 to
 happen
 why
 you
 think
 it's
 going


to
 happen
 he
 said
 WR
 write
 the
 date
 and


time
 he
 said
 by
 the
 way
 note
 how
 you


feel
 physically
 and
 emotionally
 about


this
 but
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 is
 as


you're
 expressing
 your
 variant


perception
 as
 you're
 expressing
 your


view
 that's
 different
 what's
 in
 the


market
 for
 an
 investment
 for


specifically
 he
 said
 communicate
 using


probabilities
 not
 words
 because
 if
 you


use
 words
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 vague


enough
 that
 you
 can
 uh
 massage
 them


after
 the
 fact
 but
 if
 it's
 a
 probability


it
 allows
 you
 to
 keep
 score
 and
 here's


one
 thing
 I
 would
 say
 if
 you're
 going
 to


do
 a
 probabilistic
 forecast
 you
 want


three
 elements
 one
 is
 an
 outcome
 that
 we


can
 agree
 upon
 second
 within
 a
 specific


period
 of
 time
 and
 then
 with
 some


probabil
 probability
 so
 you
 might
 say


for
 example
 weather
 is
 a
 good
 example


Tomorrow
 there's
 an
 80%
 chance
 it's


going
 to


tomorrow
 right
 so
 that
 would
 satisfy


that
 if
 you
 have
 those
 three
 ingredients


you
 are
 in
 business
 for
 doing
 uh


probabilistic


forecasts
 now
 to
 give
 you
 some
 sense
 of


how
 Wild
 this
 can
 be
 uh
 I
 did
 a
 survey


with
 my
 older
 son
 we
 U
 asked
 20
 we
 put


out
 23
 common
 words
 or
 phrases
 to
 a


population
 of
 people
 and
 we
 asked
 them


say
 what's
 the
 associated
 probability


You'
 sign
 to
 this
 word
 or
 phrase
 and


what
 you
 can
 see
 the
 answers
 are
 all


over
 the
 place
 especially
 with
 a
 cognate


now
 this
 is
 for
 maybe
 n
 native
 English


speakers
 but
 the
 cognate
 possible
 if
 you


say
 something
 is
 possible
 people


interpret
 this
 in
 extraordinarily
 wide


ranges
 so
 the
 reason
 you
 want
 to
 avoid


words
 like
 that
 it's
 a
 serious


possibility
 we'll
 have
 a
 recession
 next


year
 or
 whatever
 it
 is
 is
 because
 a


you're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 keep


track
 of
 your
 forecast
 and
 you're
 going


to
 weeze
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 after
 the
 fact
 but


B
 if
 you're
 communicating
 with
 someone


they
 may
 hear
 something
 very
 different


than
 what
 you
 mean
 and
 that's


crucial
 now
 the
 last
 aspect
 of
 this
 is


uh
 this
 came
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 before
 but


I
 think
 it's
 fascinating
 in
 in
 Adam's


com
 is
 this
 guy
 I
 love
 his
 name
 is
 Keith


stanovich
 he's
 a
 developmental


psychologist
 uh
 most
 recent
 Meritus
 at


University
 of
 Toronto
 he's
 written
 a
 lot


of
 books
 but
 he
 wrote
 a
 book
 in
 2009


called
 what
 intelligence
 tests
 Miss
 it's


not
 the
 snappiest
 book
 title
 of
 all
 time


but
 it's
 pretty
 descriptive
 of
 the


content
 and
 what
 he
 argues
 is
 there's


this
 thing
 called
 IQ
 and
 you
 know
 more


of
 it
 tends
 to
 be
 better
 than
 less
 of
 it


that's
 fine
 and
 there's
 a
 thing
 he
 calls


RQ
 rationality
 quotient
 the
 ability
 to


make
 good
 decisions
 he
 says
 that's


really
 what's
 important
 and
 and
 they're


kind
 of
 on
 different
 sliders
 and
 we
 all


know
 this
 right
 you've
 all
 gone
 to


school
 people
 did
 really
 well
 in
 school


and
 not
 so
 well
 in
 life
 and
 we
 all
 know


people
 are
 not
 very
 good
 in
 school
 but


very
 good
 at
 life
 this
 is
 this
 RQ
 IQ
 so


what
 is
 RQ
 all
 about
 it
 turns
 out
 there


are
 two
 components
 to
 it
 one
 is
 called


instrumental
 rationality
 which
 is
 a


fancy
 way
 of
 saying
 you
 can
 achieve
 your


objectives
 given
 your
 constraints
 the


way
 we
 think
 about
 this
 in
 economics
 is


the
 axum's
 utility
 Theory
 the
 second


one's
 one
 I
 think
 we
 care
 about
 and
 that


is
 this
 idea
 called
 epistemic


rationality
 it's
 a
 fancy
 word
 of
 saying


how
 accurately
 do
 your
 beliefs
 map
 to


the


world
 and
 by
 the
 way
 you
 woke
 up
 this


morning
 with
 a
 certain
 set
 of
 beliefs
 of


how
 the
 world
 works
 you
 wandered
 around


information
 confirmed
 it
 some


information
 may
 have
 disconfirmed
 it


what
 did
 you
 do
 in
 the
 face
 of
 that


evidence
 so
 here's
 a
 quote
 from
 Phil


techlock
 which
 I
 love
 and
 you
 heard
 this


earlier
 today
 in
 a
 different
 form


beliefs
 are
 hypotheses
 to
 be
 tested
 not


Treasures
 to
 be


protected
 the
 best
 investors
 take
 that


to
 heart
 beliefs
 are
 hypotheses
 to
 be


tested
 not
 Treasures
 to
 be
 protected


let's
 do
 this
 together
 ready
 late
 in
 the


day
 here's
 an
 example
 of
 how
 we
 might
 do


this
 right
 this
 is


um
 an
 example
 of
 how
 this
 works
 in


integrating
 information
 so
 imagine
 I


hope
 I
 can
 read
 this
 imagine
 a
 zapper


virus
 causes
 a
 serious
 disease
 that


occurs
 in
 one
 in
 every
 thousand


people
 say
 there's
 a
 a
 u
 a
 test
 that
 can


detect
 perfectly
 if
 you
 have
 the
 virus


going
 to
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 test


positive
 additionally
 let's
 say
 that
 the


test
 actually
 has
 a
 5%
 false
 positive
 so


if
 you
 don't
 have
 it
 it's
 going
 to
 say


you
 have
 it
 one
 and
 every
 20
 time
 5%


false
 positive
 okay
 so
 now
 we
 choose
 a


person
 at
 random
 we
 know
 nothing
 about


his
 or
 her
 medical
 history
 and
 that


person
 tested
 test
 positive
 for
 the


zapper


virus
 what
 is
 the
 probability
 from
 0
 to


100%
 that
 that
 person
 has
 the


virus
 right
 so
 the
 test
 1000
 test
 is


perfect
 5%
 Falls
 positive
 we
 have


someone
 that
 has
 the
 virus
 what's
 the


probability
 anybody
 know
 this
 one
 but


notice
 you
 have
 like
 these
 numbers
 in


your
 head
 it's
 confusing
 but
 what
 you're


doing
 is
 integrating
 various
 pieces
 of


information
 and
 the
 answer
 is
 just
 a
 bit


under


2%
 and
 let
 me
 explain
 how
 to
 come
 up


with
 that
 very
 quickly
 in
 in
 a
 way


that's
 easy
 to
 reframe
 the
 problem
 let's


say
 there
 are
 a
 thousand
 people
 we're


going
 to
 test
 all
 of
 them
 first
 person


we're
 going
 to
 test
 the
 person
 that
 has


the
 virus
 they
 test
 positive
 we
 put
 them


in
 the
 denominator
 we're
 then
 going
 to


test
 the
 other
 999
 5%
 of
 which
 will
 test


positive
 we
 put
 them
 in
 the
 denominator


so
 now
 our
 denominator
 is
 51
 we
 said
 we


picked
 one
 person
 at
 random
 they
 tested


positive
 one
 over
 51
 that's
 your
 2%


right
 when
 I
 say
 it
 that
 way
 it's
 easy


to
 follow
 no
 but
 you're
 integrating


different
 pieces
 of
 information
 and


that's
 what
 great
 investors
 were
 able
 to


do
 quite


effortlessly
 here's
 the
 last
 thing
 this


ties
 together
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 earlier


from
 Adam
 and
 also
 from
 what
 Annie
 just


talked
 about
 this
 is
 something
 called


lynchpin
 analysis
 this
 comes
 from
 the


intelligence
 Community
 when
 you're


looking
 at
 investment
 idea
 what
 you
 want


to
 do
 is
 identify
 the
 key
 issues
 that


are
 really
 important
 for
 that
 for
 most


stocks
 or
 even
 asset
 classes
 two
 or


three
 things
 tend
 to
 be
 important


pinpoint
 the
 working
 assumptions
 behind


that
 so-called
 Lyn
 pin
 premises


um
 Advanced
 evidence
 for
 or
 against
 that


and
 this
 is
 where
 you
 can
 come
 up
 with


things
 like
 The
 Devil's
 Advocate
 and


then
 any
 indicators
 or
 signposts
 right


so
 the
 way
 you
 can
 do
 this
 is
 say
 we


have
 a
 variant
 perception
 here's
 what
 we


believe
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 and
 you
 write


it
 all
 down
 in
 advance
 the
 key
 to
 these


signposts
 is
 that
 kill
 criteria
 that
 Dan


was
 talking
 about
 so
 I
 know
 in
 advance


if
 I
 have
 a
 thesis
 that's
 different
 than


the
 market
 I
 should
 have
 these
 I
 should


pass
 these
 signposts
 on
 the
 road
 and
 if


I
 don't
 then
 I
 must
 change
 my
 mind
 about


what's
 going
 on
 and
 then
 last
 by
 the
 way


I
 did
 this
 with
 Chad
 I
 was
 very
 proud
 of


myself
 I
 did
 this
 with
 Chad
 GPT
 so
 this


is
 like
 my
 my
 generative
 AI
 thing
 but


this
 is
 just
 a
 Winding
 Road
 this
 how
 I


really
 Envision
 it
 that
 you
 see
 these


signposts
 as
 you
 go
 along
 and
 if
 your


thesis
 is
 correct
 you
 should
 anticipate


seeing
 those
 signposts
 and
 if
 you
 don't


see
 the
 signpost
 you
 expect
 that
 is
 an


opportunity
 or
 in
 fact
 really
 a


challenge
 to
 change
 your


view
 so
 that
 let
 me
 stop
 what
 the
 best


investors
 do
 is
 calibrate
 well
 to
 start


they
 do
 that
 primarily
 by
 appealing
 to


base
 rates
 and
 second
 of
 course
 when
 new


information
 encourages
 you
 or
 forces
 you


to
 change
 your
 mind
 you
 should
 change


your
 mind
 when
 appropriate
 thank
 you


very
 much
