let's

and

when

the

 history
 shows
 us
 how


this
 plays
 out
 during

 Jeff

this

 repeating
 in

 Satoshi

before
 anyone

 to

 even
 the

 followed
 this
 rule


early

 thought
 they
 discovered
 a
 new


foolproof
 way
 to
 invest
 in

spoiler
 alert
 nothing
 in

 is


foolproof
 but
 here's
 the
 crucial
 point


in
 each
 case
 early
 investors
 weren't


betting
 on
 what
 these
 Technologies
 could


do
 at
 the
 time
 they
 were
 betting
 on
 what


these
 Technologies
 promised
 to
 become


the
 technology

 to
 be


perfect
 it
 just
 needs
 to
 be


revolutionary
 enough
 to
 make
 people


believe
 it
 could
 change
 everything
 and


that
 leads
 us
 to
 our
 next
 step
 in
 the


bubble
 Playbook
 once
 you
 found
 your


revolutionary
 idea
 how
 do
 you
 convince


everyone
 else
 it's
 going
 to
 change
 the


world
 once
 you've
 spotted
 your


potentially
 world
 changing
 technology


the
 next
 step
 is
 arguably
 the
 most


crucial
 selling
 the
 dream
 it's
 not


enough
 to
 have
 a
 revolutionary
 idea
 you


need
 to
 convince
 everyone
 else
 that
 this


revolution
 is
 inevitable
 in
 the
 world
 of


asset
 bubbles
 this
 means
 painting
 a


picture
 of
 a
 utopian
 future
 so


compelling


that
 it
 makes
 current
 limitations
 seem


like
 mere
 speed
 bumps
 on
 the
 road
 to


Paradise

 how
 theom

turned
 every
 website

Amazon

 just

 they
 were
 revolutionizing

 for
 the
 digital
 age
 never
 mind


that
 shipping
 50
 lb
 bags
 of
 dog
 food
 at


a
 loss
 wasn't
 exactly
 a
 sustainable


business
 model
 the
 vision
 of
 clicking
 a


button
 and
 having
 everything
 delivered


to
 your
 door
 was
 too
 seductive
 to
 resist


the
 crypto
 bubble
 mastered
 this
 art
 of


narrative
 ethereum
 wasn't
 merely
 a
 new


technology
 it
 was
 freedom
 from
 Banks


governments
 and
 all
 those
 pesky


middlemen
 taking
 their
 cut
 the
 fact
 that


most
 people
 were
 buying
 crypto
 purely
 to


sell
 it
 for
 more
 traditional
 money
 later


was
 apparently
 beside
 the
 point
 now


we're
 seeing
 the
 same
 pattern
 with
 AI


companies
 aren't
 just
 developing


algorithms
 they're
 promising
 to
 solve


everything
 from
 cancer
 to
 climate
 change


Google
 and
 Microsoft
 aren't
 selling

 they're
 selling
 a


future
 where
 AI
 handles
 all
 the
 grunt


work
 while
 humans
 focus
 on

Pursuits
 here's
 the
 key
 thing
 about


these
 Visions
 they
 aren't
 necessarily

 transform


Industries
 the
 flaw
 isn't
 in
 the
 vision


itself
 but
 in
 the
 oversimplified
 path
 to


getting
 there
 real
 transformation


requires
 rewriting
 social
 contracts
 and


changing

 behaviors
 Minor


Details
 that

 but
 selling
 the
 dream
 is
 only


part
 of
 the
 equation
 to
 really
 profit


from
 a
 bubble
 you
 need
 something
 more


concrete
 while

 visions
 of


Utopia
 the
 real
 money
 in
 bubbles
 often


comes
 from
 selling
 the
 tools
 to
 build


that
 Utopia
 these
 are
 the
 shovel
 makers


the
 companies
 and
 individuals
 who
 create


the
 essential
 infrastructure
 that
 helps


a
 speculative
 bubble
 grow
 think
 of
 them


as
 the
 clever
 Merchants
 who
 got

selling
 pickaxes
 during
 the
 Gold
 Rush


While
 most
 Prospectors
 went
 broke


hunting
 for
 gold
 in
 the
 bubble
 companies


like
 Akamai
 Technologies
 were
 the
 quiet


winners
 while
 Amazon
 was
 burning

trying
 to
 revolutionize

 aamai

profitably
 building
 the

networks
 that
 made
 the

 actually


usable
 today's
 equivalent
 in

would
 be
 coinbase
 and
 binance
 exchanges


that
 make
 money
 regardless
 of
 whether


Bitcoin
 goes
 to
 the
 moon
 or
 crashes
 back


to
 Earth
 they
 profit
 from
 every
 trade
 in


both
 directions


Nvidia
 perfected
 this
 strategy
 in
 the
 AI


boom
 while
 everyone
 debates
 whether
 AI


will
 achieve
 Consciousness
 Nvidia
 sits


back
 and
 sells
 the
 chips
 that
 power


every
 major
 AI
 model
 their
 gpus
 are
 the


modern-day
 pickaxes
 and
 they're
 selling


them
 at
 a
 premium
 to
 every
 prospector
 in


town
 even
 the
 housing
 bubble
 had
 its


infrastructure
 players
 mortgage
 brokers


appraisers
 and
 real

 agents
 made


fortunes
 by
 facilitating
 deals


regardless
 of
 whether
 the
 underlying


properties
 were
 actually
 worth
 their


inflated
 prices
 here's
 the
 beauty
 of
 the


shovel
 strategy
 while
 it
 might
 seem
 less


exciting
 than
 betting
 on
 the
 next
 Amazon


or
 Bitcoin
 it's
 often
 more
 reliable


after
 all
 in
 a
 gold
 rush
 you
 don't
 need


to
 find
 gold
 yourself
 you
 just
 need


others
 to
 keep
 believing
 they
 might
 find


it
 but
 to
 really
 amplify
 these
 gains
 you


need
 bigger
 players
 to
 enter
 the
 game


that's
 where
 institutional
 investors


come


in
 once
 you
 have
 your
 revolutionary


technology
 a
 compelling
 narrative
 and


the
 infrastructure
 to
 support
 it
 it's


time
 to
 bring
 in
 the
 big
 guns


institutional
 investors
 these
 aren't


your
 regular
 retail
 investors
 buying


stocks
 on
 Robin
 Hood
 these
 are
 the


heavyweight
 firms
 with
 billions
 to


deploy
 their
 entry
 does
 two
 things
 it


legitimizes
 your
 bubble
 and
 more


importantly
 inflates
 valuations
 to


astronomical
 levels
 remember
 when


Goldman
 Sachs
 and
 Deutsche
 Bank
 poured


billions
 into
 Doom
 IPOs
 suddenly


companies
 like
 webvan
 and
 pets.com


weren't
 just
 amb
 vicious
 startups
 they


were
 transformative
 Enterprises
 worth


billions
 on
 paper
 never
 mind
 that
 they


were
 burning
 cash
 faster
 than
 a
 Bitcoin


mining
 rig
 in
 the
 Sahara
 the
 crypto


World
 saw
 the
 same
 pattern
 when
 micro


strategy
 Tesla
 and
 major
 investment


firms
 started
 buying
 Bitcoin
 their


involvement
 wasn't
 just
 about
 investment


it
 was
 about
 validation
 each


announcement
 sent
 prices
 soaring


creating
 a
 feedback
 loop
 of
 fomo
 and


speculation
 now
 look
 at
 AI
 Microsoft


multi-billion
 dollar
 investment
 in
 open


AI
 didn't
 just
 give
 Sam
 alman's
 company


a
 Skyhigh
 valuation
 it
 signaled
 to
 every


other
 Institutional
 Investor
 that
 AI
 was


the
 next
 Gold
 Rush
 the
 result
 an


unprecedented
 flood
 of
 capital
 into


anything
 with
 AI
 in
 its
 pitch
 deck
 what


makes
 institutional
 investment
 so


powerful
 is
 its
 self-fulfilling
 nature


when
 big
 players
 invest
 they're


incentivized
 to
 maintain
 or
 increase
 the


value
 of
 their
 Investments
 they
 have
 the


resource
 and
 influence
 to
 keep
 the


bubble
 inflating
 at
 least
 until
 they
 can


position
 themselves
 for
 a
 profitable


exit
 and
 that's
 where
 we
 get
 to
 the
 most


crucial
 skill
 in
 bubble
 writing
 knowing


when
 to
 get


out
 timing
 your
 exit
 is
 the
 difference


between
 being
 Mark
 Cuban
 and
 being
 the


person
 who
 bought
 broadcast.com
 stock


right
 before
 the
 crash
 Cuban
 sold
 his


company
 to
 Yahoo
 for
 5.7
 billion
 in
 1999


just
 months
 before
 the
 dot
 bubble
 burst


while
 everyone
 else
 was
 watching
 their


portfolios
 evaporate
 Cuban
 was
 watching


the
 Dallas
 Mavericks
 from
 his
 newly


purchased
 courtside
 seats
 this
 is
 where


the
 true
 art
 of
 bubble
 writing
 comes
 in


the
 trick
 isn't
 just
 recognizing
 when


valuations
 have
 become
 absurd
 they're


usually
 absurd
 from
 the
 start
 it's


recognizing
 when
 the
 narrative
 that's


been
 driving
 the
 bubble
 starts
 to
 crack


it's
 about
 noticing
 when
 revolutionary


technology
 headlines
 start
 getting


replaced

 held

 in

70%

 sold


their

themselves
 from
 the
 2008

wiped
 out

here's
 the
 uncomfortable
 truth
 about


Bubble

 the
 Insiders
 VCS


institutional
 investors
 and
 early


adopters
 usually
 have
 a
 significant


Advantage
 they
 have
 better
 information


more
 influence
 and
 often
 the
 ability
 to


coordinate
 their
 exits
 by
 the
 time
 the


average
 investor
 realizes
 the
 bubble
 is


bursting
 the
 smart
 money
 has
 already


left
 the
 building
 however
 creating
 and


riding
 bubbles
 isn't
 just
 about
 getting


in
 early
 and
 selling
 before
 the
 crash


there's
 one
 more
 crucial
 element
 that


keeps
 the
 whole
 machine
 running


Manufacturing

the
 final
 ingredient
 in
 any
 successful


bubble
 is
 pure
 psychological
 warfare


creating
 and
 maintaining

out
 fomo
 isn't
 just
 a
 buzzword
 it's
 the


rocket
 fuel
 that
 propels
 asset
 bubbles


to
 their
 dizzying
 heights
 and
 the
 true


masters
 of
 bubble
 writing
 aren't
 just


participating
 in
 this
 psychology
 they're


actively
 engineering
 it
 during
 the
 Doom


era
 every
 new
 story
 about
 a
 College

 created
 a


new
 wave
 of
 investors
 afraid
 of
 missing


the
 the

 Microsoft
 in

 Tech
 Visionaries

Elon

 move

 with
 a


single

 a
 constant
 fear


that
 the
 next
 big
 pump
 was
 just
 around


the
 corner
 now
 in

 we
 see
 companies


racing
 to
 announce
 their
 AI
 initiatives


each
 claiming
 to
 be
 at
 the
 Forefront
 of


a
 revolution
 that's
 inevitable
 and

 the

 until


reality
 finally
 catches
 up
 with
 the


narrative
 and
 this
 brings
 us
 to
 the


fundamental
 truth
 about
 getting
 rich
 in


asset
 bubbles
 it's
 not
 about
 believing


in
 the
 long-term
 potential
 of
 the


technology
 it's
 about
 understanding
 and


exploiting

 psychology
