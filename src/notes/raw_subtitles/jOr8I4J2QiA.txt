This
 is
 the
 Bloomberg
 Daybreak
 Huet


podcast.
 Good
 morning.
 It's
 Wednesday


the
 15th
 of
 October.
 I'm
 Caroline
 Hepka


in
 London


and
 I'm
 Steven
 Carroll
 in
 Brussels.


Coming
 up
 today,
 stocks
 rally
 on
 hopes


for
 more
 Federal
 Reserve
 rate
 cuts
 as


Jerome
 Powell
 points
 to
 a
 weakening
 US


labor
 market.
 The
 United
 States
 and


China
 continue
 to
 turn
 up
 the


temperature
 on
 their
 trade
 war.


Plus,
 a
 diplomatic
 entrance
 into
 a


crowded
 field.
 A
 look
 inside
 the
 former


US
 embassy
 in
 London
 that's
 been


converted
 into
 a
 luxury
 hotel.


Let's
 start
 with
 a
 roundup
 of
 our
 top


stories.


Federal
 Reserve
 Chair
 Jerome
 Powell
 has


signaled
 an
 interest
 rate
 cut
 is
 on
 the


cards
 for
 October,
 breathing
 fresh
 life


into
 markets
 rocked
 by
 trade
 fears.
 The


US
 central
 bank
 boss
 pointed
 several


times
 to
 the
 worsening
 jobs
 data
 when


speaking
 at
 the
 National
 Association
 for


Business
 Economics
 annual
 meeting.
 He


hinted
 policy
 should
 move
 from
 being


more
 tight
 to
 neutral.
 For
 the
 last
 few


months,
 we've
 been
 able
 to
 maintain
 a


restrictive
 stance
 because
 the
 labor


market
 was
 still
 pretty
 pretty
 solid.
 I


think
 that
 the
 data
 we
 got
 right
 after


the
 uh
 July
 meeting
 showed
 that
 which


which
 adjusted
 back
 all
 the
 way
 through


May
 showed
 that
 the
 labor
 market
 has


actually
 softened
 pretty
 considerably


and
 puts
 us
 in
 a
 situation
 where
 the
 two


risks
 are
 are
 closer
 to
 being
 in


balance.
 Powell
 added
 he
 sees
 inflation


gradually
 rising,
 putting
 the
 two
 sides


of
 the
 Fed's
 mandate
 in
 conflict.
 Gold


prices
 set
 a
 new
 record
 with
 yields
 on


US
 treasuries
 falling
 to
 the
 lowest


levels
 in
 weeks.
 Stocks
 moved
 higher


after
 Powell's
 comments
 bouncing
 back


from
 a
 dip
 driven
 by
 trade
 fears.


President
 Donald
 Trump
 has
 said
 that
 the


US
 could
 stop
 trade
 in
 cooking
 oil
 with


China
 as
 tensions
 between
 the
 world's


two
 largest
 economies
 reescalate.
 Trump


cast
 the
 move
 as
 retaliation
 against


Beijing
 for
 its
 refusal
 to
 buy
 American


soybeans.
 Trump
 called
 it
 an


economically
 hostile
 act
 that
 causes


difficulty
 for
 US
 soybean
 farmers.
 Just


hours
 earlier
 though,
 the
 president
 and


US
 trade
 representative
 Jameson
 Greer


had
 expressed
 confidence
 that
 friction


with
 China
 would
 ease
 through
 ongoing


negotiations.
 The
 IMF's
 chief
 economist


Pierre
 Olivier
 Gorinas
 warned
 that
 the


economic
 consequences
 of
 the
 trade
 war


are
 already
 being
 felt.


The
 tariff
 shock
 is
 here
 and
 it
 is


further
 deming
 already
 weak
 growth


prospects.
 This
 is
 clear
 even
 in
 the
 US.


Growth
 is
 revised
 down
 from
 last
 year.


The
 labor
 market
 is
 weakening
 and


inflation
 has
 been
 revised
 up
 and
 is


persistently
 above
 target.
 Signs
 that


the
 economy
 has
 been
 hit
 by
 a
 negative


supply
 shock.


The
 IMF's
 chief
 economist
 unveiled
 a
 dim


outlook
 for
 growth
 in
 the
 short
 and
 long


term.
 He
 also
 pointed
 to
 ongoing


concerns
 about
 global
 government


borrowing,
 especially
 in
 Europe.


American
 banks
 are
 reporting
 massive


profits,
 but
 warning
 of
 trouble
 ahead.


Goldman
 Sachs,
 JP
 Morgan
 Chase,
 and


Cityroup
 all
 comfortably
 beat
 estimates


in
 their
 latest
 earnings
 reports
 with
 a


combined
 profit
 of
 more
 than
 20
 billion


dollars.
 But
 CEOs
 from
 all
 three
 US


giants
 sounded
 alarm
 bells
 about
 markets


being
 too
 optimistic.
 JP
 Morgan's
 Jamie


Diamond
 pointed
 to
 a
 pair
 of
 recent


bankruptcies
 in
 the
 private
 credit


space.
 My
 antenna
 goes
 up
 when
 things


like
 that
 happen.
 And
 I
 probably


shouldn't
 say
 this,
 but
 when
 you
 see
 one


cockroach,
 you're
 probably
 more,
 you


know,
 and
 so
 we
 we
 should
 everyone


should
 be
 forewarned
 on
 this
 one.


Diamond's
 warning
 about
 private
 credit


drew
 a
 backlash
 from
 those
 in
 the
 space


with
 Blue
 L
 Capitals
 Mark
 Lipshultz


saying
 he
 was
 fear-mongering.


Now
 to
 some
 breaking
 news.
 The
 Dutch


chip
 equipment
 maker
 ASML
 has
 reported


bookings
 for
 the
 third
 quarter
 of
 5.4
 4


billion,
 beating
 estimates.
 Net
 sales


for
 the
 third
 quarter
 came
 in
 at
 7.52


billion,
 so
 slightly
 below
 estimates
 of


7.71
 billion.
 Investors
 have
 been


focusing
 on
 ASML's
 outlook
 for
 next
 year


for
 proof
 that
 chip
 equipment
 makers
 can


capitalize
 on
 the
 AI
 boom
 as
 renewed


trade
 tensions
 between
 the
 US
 and
 China


add
 uncertainty.
 ASML
 saying
 that
 it


will
 provide
 more
 details
 on
 the
 2026


outlook
 in
 January.
 The
 company's
 shares


have
 rallied
 45%
 in
 just
 over
 a
 month
 to


make
 it
 Europe's
 most
 valuable
 listed


company.


Francis
 Prime
 Minister
 Sebastian
 Lornu


has
 won
 the
 backing
 of
 the
 Socialist


Party,
 boosting
 his
 chances
 of
 surviving


two
 no
 confidence
 votes
 tomorrow.
 The


socialists
 who
 hold
 leverage
 in
 the


lower
 house
 of
 parliament
 say
 they
 won't


move
 to
 topple
 the
 new
 government
 after


Loru
 agreed
 to
 suspend
 President
 Emanuel


Macron's
 signature
 pension
 reform
 that


raises
 the
 retirement
 age.
 The
 head
 of


the
 socialists
 in
 the
 National
 Assembly,


Baris
 Valow
 told
 lawmakers
 his
 party
 is


taking
 the
 gamble
 to
 give
 the
 country
 a


chance
 at
 a
 fair
 budget.


We
 are
 capable
 of
 bringing
 down
 a


government.
 We
 have
 done
 so
 twice.
 We


have
 only
 one
 compass.
 The
 interest
 of


the
 country,
 the
 interest
 of
 the
 French


people.
 I
 recognize
 how
 much
 it
 costs


us.
 We
 are
 making
 a
 bet.
 A
 risky
 bet


whose
 outcome
 only
 the
 future
 will


reveal.


Boris
 fellow,
 the
 head
 of
 the
 Socialist


Party
 in
 France's
 National
 Assembly


speaking
 there.
 Mar
 Le
 Pen's
 farright


national
 rally
 as
 well
 as
 the
 far-left


have
 vowed
 to
 try
 to
 topple
 Laornne's


government
 in
 no
 confidence
 votes


tomorrow
 morning.
 Lawmakers
 have
 already


forced
 two
 of
 Louru's
 predecessors,


Michelle
 Bier
 and
 France
 Beru,
 to
 resign


over
 their
 plans
 to
 rein
 in
 France's


ballooning
 budget
 deficit,
 the
 largest


in
 the
 Euro
 area.
 Bank
 of
 England


Governor
 Andrew
 Bailey
 has
 warned
 that


the
 UK
 economy
 is
 performing
 a
 little


bit
 under
 potential.
 Speaking
 at
 an


event
 in
 Washington,
 he
 cautioned


against
 threats
 from
 both
 above
 target


inflation,
 but
 also
 a
 softening
 jobs


market.
 Bailey
 told
 an
 event
 in


Washington
 that
 focusing
 on
 productivity


growth
 could
 lift
 the
 UK
 economy.


We're
 putting
 a
 lot
 more
 emphasis
 on


productivity
 growth
 really
 going


forwards
 and
 that
 is
 a
 thing
 that
 fell


off
 in
 the
 in
 the
 post
 2008
 period.


Certainly
 I
 mean
 in
 all
 countries
 other


than
 the
 US
 and
 of
 course
 even
 the
 US


it's
 very
 focused
 on
 the
 tech
 sector
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 US
 US
 absent
 the
 tech


sector
 looks
 much
 like
 the
 rest
 of
 us.


Andrew
 Bailey
 speaking
 there.
 Meanwhile,


Chancellor
 Rachel
 Reeves
 is
 also
 in


Washington
 where
 she'll
 pitch
 the
 UK's


economic
 stability
 to
 investors.
 On


Tuesday,
 the
 IMF
 predicted
 Britain
 will


suffer
 the
 fastest
 price
 growth
 in
 the


G7
 over
 the
 next
 2
 years
 and
 urged
 the


Bank
 of
 England
 to
 be
 quote
 very


cautious
 about
 further
 interest
 rate


cuts.


Those
 are
 your
 top
 stories
 on
 the


markets.
 In
 Asia,
 the
 MSE
 Irish
 Pacific


index
 up
 by
 1.7%,
 the
 Nicay
 Tokyo
 1.9%


higher.
 So
 a
 big
 difference
 in
 tone
 from


where
 we
 were
 yesterday.
 Euro
 stocks
 50


futures
 also
 up
 by
 1.3%.


S&P
 e-
 minis
 on
 Wall
 Street
 are
 4/10


higher
 as
 well.
 The
 Bloomberg
 dollar


spot
 index
 is
 210
 weaker.
 So
 the
 euro


trading
 at
 11622.


Gold
 prices
 1%
 higher
 again
 today
 $4,183


at
 troy
 ounce.


So
 those
 are
 the
 markets.
 In
 a
 moment


we're
 going
 to
 bring
 you
 more
 on
 the


market
 reaction
 to
 the
 comments
 from
 Fed


Chair
 Jerome
 Pal.
 Plus,
 we'll
 also


unpack
 what
 we
 have
 learned
 from
 the
 US


bank
 earnings.
 But
 before
 that,


something
 else
 has
 caught
 our
 eye
 in
 the


luxury
 department,
 Stephen.


Yeah,
 indeed.
 So,
 the
 new
 US
 or
 rather


the
 old
 US
 embassy
 that
 is
 now
 a
 new


hotel,
 the
 Rosewood
 Chancery
 has
 opened


today.
 Uh,
 the
 renovation
 looks
 pretty


impressive.
 The
 inside
 of
 the
 office


building
 has
 been
 torn
 down
 to
 try
 and


make
 it
 into
 um
 I
 suppose
 a
 more
 grand


space.
 The
 the
 lobby
 now
 has
 the
 one
 of


those
 criss-cross
 diag
 grid
 ceilings.


The
 windows
 and
 the
 stone
 facade
 have


got
 careful
 restoration
 as
 well.
 144


rooms.
 Our
 colleague
 Nikki
 Xeen
 has
 been


to
 visit
 it.
 H
 she
 she
 does
 highlight


the
 spas
 being
 a
 particular
 highlight.


The
 photo
 looks
 amazing
 of
 that


underground
 swimming
 pool,
 doesn't
 it?


But
 it
 doesn't
 come
 cheap.


No,
 it
 certainly
 doesn't.
 And
 a
 quick


look
 at
 prices.
 The
 cheapest
 night,


Â£1,400


uh
 before
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 Now,
 it


didn't
 go
 into
 next
 year.
 Um,
 but
 if


you're
 going,
 you
 will
 get
 to,
 for


example,
 check
 out,
 which
 you
 can
 do


without
 staying
 there
 as
 well,
 the
 uh


famous
 uh
 eagle.
 So,
 this
 was
 the
 eagle


statue
 that
 used
 to
 be
 uh
 looming
 over


the
 building
 as
 well.
 It's
 now
 been


moved,
 the
 giant
 gilded
 eagle
 to
 the


rooftop
 bar.
 Um,
 and
 also
 you
 may
 bump


into
 perhaps
 some
 visiting
 royals
 as


well.
 Nikki
 says
 that
 during
 her
 visit,


she
 spotted
 some
 embossed
 luggage
 being


whizzed
 past
 her
 in
 an
 elevator
 as
 well.


So,
 uh,
 something
 to
 look
 at
 as
 well.


But
 it's
 a
 great
 read
 if
 you
 want
 to


check
 out
 what
 uh
 the
 inside
 of
 this
 new


addition
 to
 London's
 luxury
 hotel
 zenes


look
 like.
 We'll
 put
 a
 link
 to
 it
 in
 our


podcast
 show
 notes.


Absolutely.
 Maybe
 that's
 your
 next
 spot


when
 you
 visit
 London.
 Stephen
 Cal,
 who


knows?
 Uh
 look,
 let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit


about
 uh
 our
 main
 story
 today.
 Wall


Street's
 biggest
 banks
 uh
 are
 notching


up
 record
 halls
 for
 investment
 banking


and
 trading
 revenue
 for
 this
 earning


season.
 The
 market
 isn't
 necessarily


rewarding
 top
 performers,
 though.
 Let's


get
 a
 deep
 dive
 into
 this
 with
 our


reporter
 Charlie
 Wells.
 What
 results
 do


we
 have
 so
 far,
 Charlie?
 And
 how
 is
 that


translating
 into
 share
 prices?


Well,
 the
 results
 have
 been
 excellent
 so


far.
 And
 really,
 they
 are
 a
 reflection


of
 this
 deal
 bonanza
 that
 we've
 been


seeing.
 In
 that
 third
 quarter,
 there
 was


$1
 trillion
 in
 global
 deal
 volume.
 And


we're
 seeing
 that
 translate
 to
 fees
 for


these
 investment
 banks.
 If
 you
 look
 at


Goldman
 Sachs,
 they
 had
 42%
 increase
 in


the
 quarter
 in
 investment
 banking
 fees.


solid
 investment
 banking
 numbers
 coming


in
 from
 the
 other
 major
 competitors
 and


solid
 numbers
 on
 that
 trading
 front
 as


well.
 These
 are
 very
 much
 in
 line
 or


exceeding
 expectations,
 but
 we're
 not


seeing
 that
 in
 the
 share
 prices.
 We


actually
 saw
 Goldman
 Sachs
 slip


yesterday.
 We
 saw
 JP
 Morgan
 slip


yesterday.
 We
 saw
 an
 uptick
 for
 Wells


Fargo.
 We
 saw
 an
 uptick
 for
 Croup.
 But


in
 a
 lot
 of
 ways,
 some
 of
 this


performance
 maybe
 was
 a
 reflection
 of


the
 optimism
 that
 we've
 been
 seeing.


Maybe
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 expectations
 are
 kind


of
 baked
 into
 some
 of
 these
 share
 prices


and
 also
 some
 commentary
 that
 we
 got


some
 kind
 of
 mixed
 commentary
 from


executives.
 Yeah.
 Warnings
 really
 being


couched
 by
 some
 of
 what
 we
 heard
 from


those
 CEOs
 as
 well.
 What
 did
 they
 say


about
 where
 they
 see
 the
 US
 economy


going
 in
 the
 months
 ahead?
 Well,
 there


was,
 I
 would
 say,
 kind
 of
 cautious


optimism
 for
 lack
 of
 a
 better
 term.
 I


mean,
 when
 you
 hear
 Jamie
 Diamond


talking
 about
 cockroaches,
 the
 potential


in
 the
 credit
 market,
 as
 you
 guys


referenced
 earlier
 in
 the
 program,
 I


think
 that
 that
 gives
 a
 sense
 of
 some


jitters,
 maybe
 some
 red
 flags
 that


people
 are
 looking
 out
 for.
 And
 this
 is


a
 reflection
 of
 other
 commentary
 that
 we


saw
 from
 executives.
 So,
 Mark
 Mason
 at


Cityroup,
 their
 CFO,
 talking
 about
 how


the
 consumer
 is
 becoming
 a
 little
 bit


more
 discerning.
 So,
 kind
 of
 being
 on


the
 lookout
 for
 that.
 And
 David
 Solomon,


the
 CEO
 of
 Goldman
 Sachs,
 had
 an


interesting
 point
 about
 the
 AI
 race
 that


we're
 in
 right
 now
 and
 how
 of
 course


things
 are
 going
 well,
 but
 there
 could


be
 divergence.
 So,
 some
 technologies


that
 do
 win
 out
 and
 some
 that
 lose.


Okay.
 So,
 what
 do
 we
 expect
 then
 from


today,
 the
 other
 major
 lenders


reporting?


So,
 we're
 in
 what
 I
 like
 to
 call
 the
 eye


of
 the
 bank
 earnings
 storm
 because
 we've


had
 a
 huge
 slew
 yesterday
 and
 coming
 up,


we've
 got
 more
 today
 and
 we've
 got
 Bank


of
 America
 coming
 up.
 interesting
 will


be
 to
 look
 at
 net
 interest
 income


because
 of
 course
 we
 did
 have
 that
 rate


cut
 just
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago
 so
 operating
 in


a
 different
 rate
 environment
 um
 net


interest
 income
 potentially
 changing


there
 we've
 seen
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 mixed


performance
 from
 the
 other
 banks
 and


then
 Morgan
 Stanley
 arch
 rival
 to


Goldman
 Sachs
 interestingly
 with
 Goldman


they
 had
 a
 miss
 on
 their
 equities


trading
 revenue
 it
 came
 in
 incredibly


solid
 but
 just
 not
 quite
 as
 high
 as
 a


lot
 of
 analysts
 had
 been
 expecting
 so


could
 be
 a
 similar
 picture
 there
 okay


Charlie
 Wells
 thank
 you
 very


Stay
 with
 us.
 More
 from
 Bloomberg
 Daybre


coming
 up
 after
 this.


Okay,
 let's
 bring
 you
 more
 now
 then
 on


what
 we
 have
 heard
 from
 the
 Fed
 chair


Jerome
 Pal
 and
 how
 that
 is
 being


interpreted
 by
 investors.
 Our
 markets


correspondent
 Norah
 Melinda
 joins
 us
 now


this
 morning.
 Norah,
 good
 morning.
 Talk


us
 through
 then
 how
 markets
 have


actually
 been
 reading
 and
 reacting
 to


Powell's
 comments.
 He
 was
 pointing
 of


course
 to
 the
 weakness
 in
 the
 US
 labor


market.
 Well,
 certainly
 a
 lot
 to
 digest


that
 we've
 been
 seeing
 in
 recent
 days


here.
 I
 mean,
 of
 course,
 when
 we
 hear


Powell,
 of
 course,
 he's
 the
 name
 that


everyone
 likes
 to
 listen
 to
 as
 we're


thinking
 about
 the
 details
 and
 parsing


what
 he's
 saying.
 That's
 really
 the


indication
 of
 what
 things
 may


potentially
 look
 like
 moving
 forward


here.
 So,
 if
 we
 take
 a
 look
 at
 what


Jerome
 said
 yesterday,
 he
 pointed


several
 times
 to
 the
 low
 pace
 of
 hiring


and
 also
 noted
 that
 it
 may
 also
 weaken


further.
 So,
 you
 did
 see
 some
 activity


out
 in
 the
 market
 yesterday
 uh
 at
 the


closing
 bell.
 So,
 we
 did
 see
 stocks
 end


lower
 yesterday
 in
 New
 York
 City.
 Uh,


but
 we
 also
 have
 traders
 that
 are
 all


but
 surely
 pricing
 in
 a
 cut
 at
 the
 end


of
 this
 month
 in
 October.
 So,
 you
 really


are
 seeing
 people
 taking
 away
 what


Jerome
 Pal
 is
 saying
 as
 a
 slight


indication
 here
 that
 there
 could
 be
 a


cut
 ahead.


So,
 we're
 still
 waiting
 for
 the


September
 inflation
 report.
 That'll
 come


just
 before
 the
 next
 Fed
 meeting
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 month.
 How
 is
 that
 likely
 to


interact
 with
 the
 calculations
 that


policy
 makers
 are
 are
 making
 ahead
 of


that
 meeting?


Well,
 it's
 an
 interesting
 time
 period


given
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 miss
 the
 labor


data
 that
 always
 comes
 at
 the
 first


Friday
 of
 the
 month.
 That
 of
 course
 due


to
 the
 government
 government
 shutdown


that
 has
 been
 ongoing
 here.
 So,
 it'll
 be


interesting
 to
 see
 how
 they
 utilize
 this


data,
 the
 inflation
 report
 that
 we
 will


be
 getting.
 The
 only
 reason
 that
 we
 are


getting
 the
 CPI
 report
 is
 because
 they


use
 it
 towards
 some
 of
 the
 calculations


that
 they
 make
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 US


social
 security
 benefits.
 So
 they
 are


recalling
 some
 people
 to
 come
 back
 and


help
 get
 this
 uh
 print
 out
 on
 uh
 the


docket
 here.
 But
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 an


interesting
 time
 period
 as
 the
 bears
 and


bulls
 are
 kind
 of
 pulling
 back
 and
 forth


here
 in
 the
 market
 trying
 to
 get
 a
 good


read
 on
 what
 the
 economy
 is
 looking
 like


with
 little
 data
 to
 work
 with
 here.


Yeah,
 absolutely.
 And
 so
 in
 terms
 of
 you


know
 the
 news
 around
 the
 Fed,
 it's
 it's


also
 the
 interaction
 with
 the
 trade


issue
 between
 the
 US
 and
 China
 that
 is


so
 important.


Absolutely.
 you
 are
 seeing
 so
 many


headlines
 flying
 back
 and
 forth.
 Of


course,
 more
 recently,
 it's
 just
 been


the
 battle
 between
 Trump
 and
 uh
 China


here
 and
 just
 trying
 to
 find
 a
 sense
 of


calm.
 So,
 you
 are
 seeing
 in
 the
 market
 a


lot
 of
 people
 just
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


how
 they
 can
 capitalize
 on
 this
 moment.


We've
 been
 talking
 so
 much
 about
 the


taco
 trade,
 which
 essentially
 means


Trump
 always
 chickens
 out.
 So,
 we
 did


see
 a
 lot
 of
 investors
 capitalizing
 on


that
 moment
 back
 in
 April
 when
 we
 saw
 a


lot
 of
 those
 tariff
 headlines
 here.
 So,


it's
 about
 what
 they
 can
 do
 during
 this


time
 period
 and
 how
 you
 can
 essentially


position
 yourself
 in
 a
 moment
 of
 extreme


uncertainty
 and
 volatility
 that's
 clear


here
 in
 the
 market.
