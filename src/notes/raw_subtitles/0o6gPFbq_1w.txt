Adam
 Smith
 is
 regarded
 as
 the
 father
 of


capitalism.
 In
 1776,
 he
 published
 an


inquiry
 into
 the
 wealth
 of
 nations,


revolutionizing
 economic
 thought.
 Almost


250
 years
 later,
 his
 ideas
 have
 shaped


the
 economic
 system
 that
 dominates
 the


world.
 But
 would
 he
 recognize
 his
 vision


in
 today's
 practice?
 Let's
 see
 how
 Smith


reacts
 to
 two
 of
 capitalism's
 most


prominent
 champions.
 Remarkable
 what


markets
 have
 built.
 In
 my
 day,
 I
 could


scarcely
 imagine
 such
 prosperity.
 built


it
 all
 myself.
 Nobody
 builds
 like
 Trump.


We're
 expanding
 markets
 beyond
 Earth
 now


to
 Mars
 and
 beyond.
 And
 how
 have
 you


achieved
 such
 extraordinary
 wealth?


Innovation,
 disruption,
 taking
 risks


others
 won't.
 I
 understand
 your
 Tesla


company
 received
 substantial
 government


subsidies.
 Those
 were
 available
 to


anyone
 innovating
 in
 clean
 energy.
 The


government
 created
 market
 incentives
 and


I
 responded
 efficiently.
 Curious.
 In
 my


work,
 I
 noted
 that
 people
 of
 the
 same


trade
 seldom
 meet
 together,
 even
 for


merrynt
 and
 diversion.
 But
 the


conversation
 ends
 in
 a
 conspiracy


against
 the
 public.
 I
 worried
 about


businesses
 seeking
 favors
 from


government.
 I've
 gotten
 plenty
 of
 tax


breaks
 for
 my
 buildings.
 That's
 just


smart
 business.
 The
 government
 offers


it,
 you
 take
 it.
 Yet
 you
 both
 criticize


government
 intervention
 in
 markets.
 In


my
 view,
 government
 should
 provide


certain
 public
 works
 and
 institutions


which
 it
 can
 never
 be
 for
 the
 interest


of
 any
 individual
 or
 small
 number
 of


individuals
 to
 erect
 and
 maintain.
 But


today's
 government
 is
 inefficient
 and


corrupt.
 Exactly.
 And
 I
 made
 a
 fortune


in
 real
 estate
 without
 government
 help.


My
 properties
 are
 magnificent.
 Trump


Tower
 is
 probably
 the
 most
 successful


building
 in
 New
 York.
 Mr.
 Trump,
 I


understand
 your
 wealth
 derives


substantially
 from
 land
 ownership
 and


rents.
 I
 own
 the
 best
 properties,
 prime


real
 estate,
 tremendous
 value.


I
 wrote
 that
 landlords
 love
 to
 reap


where
 they
 never
 sowed
 and
 often
 become


wealthy
 in
 their
 sleep
 without
 working,


thinking,
 or
 taking
 the
 least
 trouble.
 I


believe
 the
 progress
 of
 society
 came


from
 productive
 industry,
 not
 passive


collection
 of
 rents.
 I
 built
 these


buildings.
 I
 improve
 the
 land.
 I


actually
 create
 things.
 My
 companies


make
 revolutionary
 products.
 Indeed.


Yet,
 I
 understand
 you've
 purchased


existing
 companies
 rather
 than
 starting


many
 of
 them
 and
 now
 work
 to
 eliminate


competition.
 I
 warned
 that
 monopolies


are
 a
 great
 enemy
 to
 good
 management.
 My


companies
 create
 more
 competition.
 Look


at
 Tesla.
 We've
 forced
 the
 entire
 auto


industry
 to
 embrace
 electric
 vehicles.


And
 I've
 created
 thousands
 of
 jobs
 with


my
 properties.
 Beautiful
 jobs.
 The
 best


jobs.
 Speaking
 of
 jobs,
 my
 employees


work
 harder
 than
 anyone.
 They're
 paid


well
 for
 their
 innovation.
 How
 do
 you


compensate
 your
 workers?
 Market
 rates,


sometimes
 with
 stock
 options.
 I


advocated
 that
 high
 wages
 to
 workers


were
 the
 foundation
 of
 national


prosperity.
 No
 society
 can
 surely
 be


flourishing
 and
 happy,
 of
 which
 the
 far


greater
 part
 of
 the
 members
 are
 poor
 and


miserable.
 Workers
 today
 are
 paid
 what


they're
 worth.
 The
 market
 decides.
 We


need
 to
 reduce
 regulations
 that
 force


artificial
 wage
 force.
 Yet,
 I
 argued
 the


law
 should
 not
 be
 hostile
 to
 workers


when
 they
 combine
 to
 raise
 wages,
 just


as
 it
 shouldn't
 help


them.
 We
 have
 no
 acts
 of
 parliament


against
 combining
 to
 lower
 the
 price
 of


work,
 but
 many
 against
 combining
 to


raise
 it.
 Look,
 I've
 been
 very
 generous


to
 my
 employees.
 Very
 generous.
 They


love
 working
 for
 me.
 The
 free
 market
 is


the
 ultimate
 arbiter.
 If
 workers
 feel


underpaid,
 they
 can
 go
 elsewhere.


Exactly.
 And
 another
 thing
 about


capitalism,
 it
 rewards
 visionaries.


People
 who
 can
 see
 what
 others
 can't.


That's
 why
 we're
 successful.
 H
 I
 see.


That's
 quite
 interesting.
 Adam
 Smith


lived
 during
 the
 early
 days
 of


industrial
 capitalism,
 observing
 small


workshops
 and
 local
 markets
 where


producers
 and
 consumers
 often
 knew
 each


other
 personally.
 The
 invisible
 hand
 he


described
 operated
 within
 communities


where
 reputation
 mattered
 and


relationships
 were
 direct.
 Smith's


capitalism
 emerged
 from
 mercantalism


where
 trade
 was
 heavily
 regulated
 by


governments
 seeking
 to
 accumulate
 gold


and
 silver.
 He
 advocated
 for
 freer


markets
 but
 never
 envisioned
 the
 extreme


concentration
 of
 wealth
 or
 corporate


power
 we
 see
 today.
 For
 Smith,


competition
 required
 many
 small


producers,
 not
 a
 handful
 of
 dominant


firms.
 Yes,
 today's
 free
 markets
 are


anything
 but
 free.
 They
 involve


government
 subsidies,
 regulatory


credits,
 strategic
 bankruptcies,
 and
 tax


loopholes
 that
 benefit
 insiders.
 But


that
 observation
 alone
 doesn't
 tell
 us


much
 about
 the
 systems
 evolution.
 The


more
 fascinating
 question
 is,
 how
 has


capitalism
 transformed
 into
 something


Adam
 Smith
 would
 barely
 recognize?
 Smith


lived
 in
 a
 world
 where
 information


traveled
 at
 the
 speed
 of
 horses,
 where


most
 people
 never
 ventured
 more
 than
 20


m
 from
 their
 birthplace.
 The
 idea
 that


you
 could
 order
 a
 product
 manufactured


on
 another
 continent
 and
 receive
 it


within
 days
 would
 have
 seemed
 like


sorcery.
 Global
 supply
 chains,


instantaneous
 electronic
 transactions,


and
 multinational
 corporations
 operating


across
 hundreds
 of
 jurisdictions
 weren't


just
 undeveloped
 in
 Smith's
 time.
 They


were
 unimaginable.
 Capitalism
 evolved


because
 it
 had
 to.
 The
 industrial


revolution
 created
 production


capabilities
 that
 vastly
 exceeded
 local


demand.
 New
 transportation
 technologies,


steamships,
 railroads,
 eventually


airplanes,
 made
 global
 trade


increasingly
 practical.
 Digital


technologies
 later
 accelerated
 these


trends
 exponentially.
 This
 evolution


solved
 problems
 Smith's
 version
 of


capitalism
 never
 had
 to
 face.
 How
 do
 you


coordinate
 production
 across
 continents?


How
 do
 you
 mobilize
 the
 massive
 capital


needed
 for
 modern
 infrastructure?
 How
 do


you
 manage
 risk
 in
 a
 globally


interconnected
 economy?
 The
 solutions,


large
 corporations,
 stock
 markets,


complex
 financial
 instruments,


international
 trade
 agreements,
 created


unprecedented
 prosperity,
 and
 lifted


billions
 from
 subsistence
 living.
 Yet,


they
 also
 produce
 second
 order
 effects.


Extreme
 wealth
 concentration,


environmental
 externalities,
 and


economic
 power
 that
 transcends
 national


boundaries.
 These
 aren't
 bugs
 in
 the


system,
 they're
 features.
 A
 global


economy
 of
 8
 billion
 people
 requires


coordination
 mechanisms
 far
 beyond
 what


Smith
 envisioned
 for
 local
 markets.


However,
 these
 mechanisms
 have
 been


increasingly
 captured
 by
 those
 who


understand
 how
 to
 manipulate
 them.


Today's
 economic
 elites
 don't
 just


participate
 in
 markets,
 they
 shape
 them.


They
 don't
 just
 follow
 regulations,
 they


help
 write
 them.
 They
 don't
 just
 compete


within
 systems,
 they
 design
 the
 systems


themselves.
 The
 question
 isn't
 whether


we
 should
 return
 to
 some
 mythical
 pure


capitalism
 that
 never
 really
 existed.


It's
 whether
 we
 can
 evolve
 our
 economic


systems
 once
 again
 to
 address
 the


challenges
 of
 our
 time,
 climate
 change,


technological
 disruption,
 and
 the


concentration
 of
 both
 wealth
 and
 power.


Smith
 believed
 markets
 should
 serve


human
 flourishing.
 Looking
 at
 today's


system,
 would
 he
 recognize
 that


foundational
 purpose?
 Or
 would
 he
 see
 a


system
 that
 has
 optimized
 for
 profit
 at


the
 expense
 of
 the
 broader
 human
 welfare


he
 originally
 envisioned?
