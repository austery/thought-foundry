One
 of the
 most
 disruptive
 and


innovative
 forces
 in
 the
 ETF
 world


today,
 the
 investor
 queen
 Kathy
 Wood.


The
 ARC
 Innovation
 ETF
 trading
 now
 near


a
 52-
 week
 high
 returned
 an
 astounding


148%


>> returning
 more
 than
 170%
 last
 year
 now


has
 $17
 billion
 under
 management.
 My


conviction
 is
 so
 high
 because
 of
 what
 I


do
 on
 a
 day-to-day
 basis.
 We
 are
 doing


original
 research
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


these
 companies
 that
 are
 going
 to


transform
 the
 world.


>> Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 please
 welcome
 Art


Invests

 Wood.


[Music]


Well,
 greetings.
 I'm
 so
 delighted
 to
 be


here.
 Uh
 my
 maiden
 voyage.
 uh
 and
 I
 am


here
 to
 talk
 about
 how
 the
 world's
 going


to
 transform
 uh
 during
 the
 next
 5
 to
 10


years
 uh
 and
 how
 much
 more
 rapidly
 we


will
 see
 real
 GDP
 grow
 and
 how
 low


inflation
 is
 going
 to
 be
 and
 why.
 So


here
 we
 go.
 Here
 is
 a
 timeline
 of


innovation


and
 uh
 you
 can
 see
 it
 goes
 into
 the


1700s


and
 our
 chief
 futurist
 Brett
 Winton
 in


conjunction
 with
 academics
 pulled
 this


together
 and
 what
 you're
 seeing
 here
 is


the
 impact
 of
 innovation
 on
 productivity


and
 you
 can
 see
 in
 this
 time
 we've
 had


two
 great
 eras.
 The
 first
 one
 was
 in
 the


late
 1800s,
 early
 1900s.
 Telephone,


electricity,
 internal
 combustion
 engine,


huge
 boost
 in
 GDP
 growth.
 And
 in
 fact,


prior
 to
 that,
 for
 the
 400
 years
 prior


to
 that,
 real
 GDP
 growth
 had
 been


averaging
 about
 0.6%


per
 year.
 Very
 slow.
 After
 that,
 we
 went


into
 a
 125
 year
 period
 of
 3%
 real
 GDP


growth.
 So,
 a
 five-fold
 increase
 from


0.6
 to
 3%.
 You
 have
 to
 move
 uh
 to


forward
 to
 today
 to
 see
 multiple


innovation
 platforms
 evolving
 at
 the


same
 time.
 So
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 125


years
 this
 time
 there
 are
 five
 platforms


not
 three
 major
 platforms
 and
 they


involve
 15
 different
 technologies.
 This


is
 very
 important
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 to


research
 and
 analyze
 the
 world.
 It's
 not


going
 to
 be
 by
 sector
 or
 industry


anymore.
 It
 is
 going
 to
 be
 by
 technology


because
 technology
 is
 permeating
 every


sector,
 every
 industry
 and
 blurring
 the


lines
 between
 them.
 So
 you
 can
 see
 five


here.
 We
 believe
 that
 the
 productivity


uplift
 here
 is
 going
 to
 be
 so
 strong


during
 the
 next
 5
 to
 10
 years.
 And
 I


think
 President
 Trump's
 tax
 package
 is


going
 to
 turbocharge
 this
 that
 real
 GDP


growth
 will
 accelerate
 from
 that
 3%


where
 it
 has
 been
 for
 the
 last
 125
 years


towards
 7%
 plus.
 And
 we
 think
 that
 could


be
 conservative.
 That's
 a
 little
 more


than
 two
 times
 as
 opposed
 to
 the


five-fold
 uplift
 before.
 So,
 get
 ready.


But
 the
 other
 thing
 that
 we
 think
 is


going
 to
 happen
 is
 that
 inflation
 is


going
 to
 surprise


significantly
 on
 the
 low
 side
 of


expectations.
 We
 would
 not
 be
 surprised


to
 see
 0%
 inflation
 or
 less
 as
 we
 exit


the
 tariffs
 here.
 and
 and
 the
 way


they're
 uh
 getting
 through
 the
 indexes


and
 and
 move
 forward
 into
 this
 new
 age


of
 technological
 explosion.
 One
 of
 the


reasons
 for
 this
 explosion
 is
 not
 just


the
 five
 platforms.
 So
 I
 should
 have


named
 them
 robotics,
 energy
 storage,


artificial
 intelligence,
 blockchain


technology
 and
 multiomic
 sequencing.


five
 major
 platforms
 involving
 15


different
 technologies.
 And
 here
 you
 can


see
 why
 we
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 see


explosive
 growth.
 It
 is
 the
 convergence


between
 and
 among
 these
 technologies.
 So


just
 to
 give
 you
 uh
 two
 e
 examples
 of


convergence
 in
 the
 autonomous
 mobility


space
 that
 is
 the
 convergence
 of


robotics,


energy
 storage
 and
 artificial


intelligence.
 Now,
 each
 one
 of
 those


technologies
 or
 platforms
 is
 following


its
 own
 scurve


and
 we
 are
 moving
 into
 the
 sweet
 spot
 of


the
 S-curve
 now
 that
 autonomous
 taxis


are
 debuting
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Tesla
 in


Austin
 and
 San
 Francisco.
 Whimo's
 been


there
 for
 a
 while.
 Just
 think
 about


that.
 One
 Scurve
 feeding
 another
 Scurve


feeding
 another
 Scurve.
 That's
 why
 we're


going
 to
 see
 explosive
 growth.
 Another


example
 is
 in
 the
 healthc
 care
 space.


While
 the
 autonomous
 mobility
 space


might
 be
 the
 biggest
 revenue
 generator


in
 the
 short
 term,
 we
 believe
 that
 the


most
 profound
 application
 of
 AI
 is
 in


healthcare
 and
 that's
 the
 convergence
 of


sequencing
 technologies
 and
 artificial


intelligence
 and
 technologies
 like


crisper
 gene
 editing.
 And
 I
 think
 this


is
 the
 sleeper.
 It's
 the
 most


inefficiently
 priced
 part
 of
 the
 market.


So
 you
 can
 see
 why
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 so


important
 to
 set
 up
 research
 departments


by
 technology,
 not
 by
 sector
 or


industry.
 And
 on
 this
 last
 page
 here,


here
 is
 what
 we
 think
 is
 going
 to
 happen


to
 the
 equity
 market
 in
 terms
 of


valuations.


So
 you
 can
 see
 in
 the
 turquoise
 there,


that's
 the
 MAG
 Six.
 The
 Mag
 Six.
 Uh,
 it


used
 to
 be
 called
 the
 Mag
 7,
 but
 they


threw
 Tesla
 out
 when
 it
 wasn't
 behaving


like
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 MAG
 6.
 So,
 you
 can


see
 from
 2019
 to
 2024,
 the
 MAG
 6


tripled,
 they
 tripled
 in
 valuation
 in


the
 market
 market
 cap.
 Whereas
 truly


disruptive
 innovation
 in
 the
 purple
 at


the
 bottom
 there
 went
 up
 only
 30%.
 And


that's
 because
 investors
 were
 playing
 it


safe
 and
 they
 were
 uh
 they
 were


investing
 only
 in
 the
 largest
 most


cashrich
 stocks
 in
 the
 market.
 That
 was


a
 very
 difficult
 time
 for
 innovation
 for


venture
 capital
 generally


and
 you
 can
 see
 what
 we
 expect
 to
 happen


between
 well
 really
 the
 next
 five
 years


the
 uh
 mag
 six
 some
 of
 them
 will
 do
 well


some
 are
 facing
 headwinds.
 Apples
 in
 the


AI
 space
 are
 well
 documented
 and
 now
 we


think
 it
 is
 truly
 disruptive


innovation's
 time
 to
 shine
 in
 the


market.
 I
 feel
 as
 though
 a
 rubber
 band


has
 been
 stretching
 for
 the
 last
 four


years
 and
 it
 let
 go
 with
 the
 election
 of


Donald
 Trump.
 That's
 when
 truly


disruptive
 innovation
 started
 to
 to


shine
 and
 the
 stock
 market
 started
 to


broaden
 out
 from
 the
 very
 concentrated


max
 six
 strategies
 into
 much
 more


widespread


disruptive
 innovation.
 In
 other
 words,


risk
 appetite
 and
 time
 horizon
 is


starting
 to
 extend
 here.
 And
 I
 think
 the


tax
 package,
 especially
 the
 corporate


tax
 cuts,
 which
 most
 people
 haven't


focused
 on,
 full
 depreciation
 of


structures
 first
 year
 they're
 put
 in


service,
 full
 expensing
 of
 equipment,


R&D
 domestic
 and
 software
 in
 year
 1.


These
 are
 huge,
 huge
 incentives
 to


invest
 now.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 exactly


what's
 going
 to
 happen.
 And
 you
 can
 see


the
 difference
 here.
 the
 truly


disruptive
 innovation
 we
 would
 expect.


Now
 we
 did
 this
 chart
 at
 the
 end
 of
 last


year
 during
 the
 next
 five
 years
 to


deliver
 a
 compound
 annual
 rate
 of
 return


of
 roughly
 50%.
 Now
 we've
 had
 some
 of


that
 so
 maybe
 it's
 40
 to
 45%
 compound


annual
 rate
 of
 change.
 Uh
 and
 this
 is
 in


the
 public
 equity
 world.
 in
 the
 private


world.
 Uh
 just
 wait
 until
 you
 see
 with


that


disclosures.
 Of
 course,


>> they
 know
 the
 disclosure.


>> Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 Kathy
 Wood.
 Kathy,


join
 us.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Thanks
 for
 watching.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 coming.
 I
 know


you're
 very
 busy.


>> My
 pleasure.
 You're
 projecting
 in
 5


years,
 Bitcoin
 hits
 3.8
 million
 per


coin.
 That's
 five
 times
 the
 market
 cap


of
 gold,
 which
 has
 hit
 an
 all-time
 high.


>> Walk
 us
 through
 the
 math
 here.


>> So,
 uh,
 I'm
 going
 to
 just
 correct
 that
 a


bit.
 So,


>> okay.


>> Uh,
 our
 official
 for
 bull
 case
 is
 1.5


million.


>> Okay.


>> Now,
 what
 what
 got
 us
 to
 that
 3.8
 8
 is


using
 modern
 portfolio
 theory.
 Uh
 if
 we


were
 to
 include


uh
 Bitcoin
 in
 portfolios
 at
 its
 optimal


weight,
 so
 maximizing
 the
 sharp
 ratio


that
 would
 have
 provided
 that
 increment


to
 3.8
 million.
 Now,
 believe
 it
 or
 not,


that
 position
 size
 when
 we
 did
 that


analysis
 was
 19%
 of
 a
 diversified


portfolio.


>> That's
 a
 lot.


>> That's
 a
 lot.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 have
 more
 in
 mine.


>> Well,
 you
 swing
 for
 the
 fences.
 When


your
 cousins,
 your
 when
 civilians
 ask


you,
 "Hey,
 how
 much
 Bitcoin
 should
 I


own?"
 What's
 the
 number
 you
 would
 say
 in


private
 to
 a
 family
 member?


>> To
 a
 family
 member.


>> Yeah.
 you
 you
 want
 to
 protect
 them.


You're
 not
 like,
 "Hey,
 we're


>> we're
 swinging
 for
 the
 fences.
 This


needs
 to
 be
 our
 home
 run."
 But


>> I'll
 tell
 you
 what
 I've
 told
 my
 children


for
 a
 long
 time
 now
 is
 average
 in.
 I


mean,
 you
 know,
 average
 in,
 you
 know,


every
 month,
 every
 just
 average
 in
 and


uh
 and
 and
 then
 I
 would
 leave
 it
 to
 them


in
 terms
 of
 their
 comfort
 factor.


>> Got
 it.
 Kathy,
 can
 I
 ask
 you
 about
 Yes.


So
 ARC
 has


this
 ability
 to
 be
 a
 vehicle
 for
 a
 lot


of
 folks
 that
 are
 just
 living
 their


normal
 day-to-day
 lives
 and
 they
 want


the
 answer
 to
 what
 is
 going
 to
 do
 well


in
 the
 future
 and
 they
 can
 go
 and
 they


can
 they
 can
 buy
 your
 ETFs
 and
 then
 they


can
 participate
 in
 that
 future.
 There's


a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 are
 frustrated


palpably
 frustrated
 with
 an
 inability
 to


sort
 of
 get
 ahead
 and
 break
 through


build
 wealth


first.
 What
 is
 economically
 happening
 in


in
 America
 that
 prevents
 so
 many
 people?


What
 do
 you
 see?
 Number
 one.
 And
 then


number
 two,


what
 characteristics
 and
 responsibility


do
 retail
 investors
 have?
 If
 they're


going
 to
 yolo
 this
 and
 if
 they're
 going


to
 buy
 this
 other
 thing
 and
 they're


going
 to
 try
 to
 go
 further
 out
 on
 the


risk
 spectrum,
 what
 is
 their


responsibility
 so
 that
 there's
 no
 crying


in
 the
 casino?


>> There
 are
 ways
 to
 access
 innovation.
 And


one
 of
 the
 question
 many
 ways
 of
 course


uh
 we
 have
 packaged
 it
 up.
 We
 don't
 look


anything
 like
 a
 traditional
 benchmark.


So
 if
 they're
 diversifying
 we're
 a
 very


good
 uh
 source
 of
 diversification


especially
 in
 trying
 to
 uh
 get
 exposure


to
 innovation.
 We
 also
 have
 a
 venture


fund.
 One
 of
 the
 questions
 I
 get


regularly
 from
 retail
 investors
 used
 to


be,
 why
 can't
 we
 access
 the
 private


markets?
 We
 know
 more
 about
 those


technologies
 than
 most
 of
 the


institutions
 who
 are
 buying
 them.
 They


have
 no
 idea.
 We're
 passionate
 about
 it.


And
 so
 we've
 gotten
 more
 vocal
 and
 this


administration
 is
 certainly
 uh
 becoming


more
 vocal
 and
 and
 and
 um
 more
 more


focused
 on
 this
 this
 particular
 idea


because
 it
 is
 unamerican,
 right?
 To
 you


have
 to
 meet
 this
 price.


>> Well,
 you
 use
 chat
 GPT
 every
 day,
 but


you
 can't
 buy
 OpenAI.


>> Exactly.


>> But
 you
 can
 buy
 a
 lottery
 ticket
 or
 you


can
 bet
 on
 sports


>> and
 it
 makes
 no
 sense.
 And
 I
 do
 think


it's
 going
 to
 change
 and
 I
 think
 this


administration


>> How
 should
 it
 change?
 Should
 we
 just


have
 and
 I've
 advocated
 for
 this
 before


on
 the
 pod
 uh
 and
 I
 believe
 you've


talked
 about
 it
 6%
 of
 the
 country
 5
 6%


are
 accredited
 you
 got
 small
 number
 who


are
 QPS
 should
 we
 just
 have
 a
 test
 you


know
 you
 get
 a
 license
 to
 own
 a
 gun
 or


drive
 a
 car
 cut
 hair
 in
 this
 country
 why


not
 just
 have
 a
 simple
 accreditation


test
 you
 understand
 diversification
 you


understand
 private
 versus
 public
 assets


how
 to
 read
 a
 balance
 sheet
 wouldn't


that
 just
 solve
 the
 problem
 right
 quick


>> I
 mean
 I
 used
 to
 say
 you
 know
 it
 would


be
 what
 we're
 doing
 in
 the
 investment


world
 right
 now
 would
 be
 the
 equivalent


of
 saying
 you
 can't
 drive
 because
 you


don't
 h
 make
 enough
 money
 or
 you
 do
 not


have
 enough
 net
 worth.
 Take
 a
 test.


>> Take
 a
 test.
 And
 we
 we
 have
 this
 big


question
 in
 the
 country
 about


polarization
 of
 wealth.
 50
 60%
 of
 the


country
 has
 some
 exposure
 equities,
 but


the
 people
 who
 don't,
 they
 tend
 to
 trend


towards
 socialism
 or
 handouts.
 Maybe


they
 don't
 feel
 they're
 part
 of
 what
 we


experience,
 which
 is
 we
 meet
 great


founders
 and
 you
 get
 to
 do
 public
 and


private
 and
 we
 get
 to
 say,


>> "Yeah,
 you
 know,
 I
 drove
 in
 a
 FSD
 car


when
 Tesla
 was
 private
 or
 whatever
 it


is,
 and
 or
 I
 looked
 at
 Coinbase
 when
 it


was
 private
 or
 Uber.
 Yeah,
 I
 got
 the


sense
 I
 want
 to
 put
 one
 or
 two%
 into


that."


>> Yes.


>> Yeah.
 It
 does
 feel
 profoundly
 unfair,


doesn't
 it?


>> Yes.
 Yes.


>> Kathy,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 u
 market
 signals


right
 now
 that
 are
 flashing
 green.


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 market
 signals
 that
 are


flashing
 red.
 Do
 you
 feel
 that
 you
 have


to
 position
 actively
 to
 all
 of
 those


things
 or
 do
 you
 say
 you
 know what
 I


can't
 control
 this
 I
 need
 to
 look
 5


years
 out.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 manage
 the
 risk


and
 how
 do
 you
 view
 the
 markets
 today?


>> Yes.
 Uh
 so
 the
 risk
 question
 obviously


we
 get
 a
 lot
 because
 our
 portfolios
 are


volatile.
 they
 don't
 look
 like
 the


benchmarks.
 And
 uh
 when
 markets
 get
 uh


uh
 into
 a
 bearish
 period,
 investors
 tend


to
 hug
 their
 benchmarks
 and
 we're
 moving


in
 the
 opposite
 direction.
 Uh
 so
 I
 just


want
 to
 say
 we
 do
 what
 we
 do
 and
 you


know
 that's
 what
 our
 adviserss
 expect.


They
 don't
 expect
 us
 to
 raise
 cash
 or
 or


do
 anything.
 They
 might
 that's
 their


decision,
 right?
 In
 terms
 of
 what
 we
 do


to
 control
 risk
 during
 bare
 markets,
 we


will
 concentrate
 towards
 our
 highest


conviction
 names.
 We
 have
 a
 scoring


system
 based
 on
 management,
 execution,


moat
 or
 barriers
 to
 entry,
 product,


service,
 leadership,
 valuation


importantly
 and
 thesis
 risk.
 So
 uh
 with


those
 scores
 we
 concentrate
 during
 bull


markets
 which
 I
 do
 believe
 we
 are
 in
 a


bull
 market
 that
 is
 broadening
 out.
 we


tend
 to
 diversify
 because
 the
 IPOs
 start


appearing
 again
 and
 um
 we
 have
 more


information
 on
 some
 of
 the
 companies


we've
 sold
 during
 the
 bare
 market.


>> Give
 us
 the
 read
 on
 Elon's
 trillion


dollar
 pay
 package.


>> You
 know
 what's
 so
 interesting
 about
 it?


Uh
 and
 this
 happened
 with
 the
 first


model
 we
 put
 out.
 We
 put
 out
 a
 model
 uh


once
 a
 year
 of
 Tesla
 and
 with
 our
 price


target
 five
 years
 out.
 We
 looked
 at
 his


first
 package
 and
 we
 said
 that
 looks


like
 our
 model
 and
 we
 looked
 at
 this
 one


and
 we
 said
 that
 looks
 like
 our
 model


and
 our
 model
 is


>> your
 10
 year
 forecast
 has
 Tesla
 at
 8
 and


a
 half
 n
 trillion.


>> Well,
 right
 and
 we
 we
 put
 out
 there
 five


years.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 if


he
 delivers
 on
 humanoid
 robots
 the
 way


he
 thinks
 he
 is,
 we
 don't
 have
 enough
 in


there.
 So
 our
 price
 target
 is
 2600.
 I


think
 it's
 at
 330
 today.
 Something
 like


that.


>> Exactly.


>> Yeah.
 2600.
 And
 and
 we
 have
 very
 little


for
 humanoid
 in.
 But
 what
 Elon
 is


capitalizing
 on
 is
 this
 convergence
 that


I
 mentioned.
 Robotics,
 energy
 storage,


and
 AI.
 That
 convergence
 in
 the
 robo


taxi
 space
 is
 pretty
 much
 the
 same


convergence
 in
 the
 humanoid
 robot
 space.


Do
 you
 underwrite


>> compensation
 as
 part
 of
 your
 model?


Meaning
 like
 when
 you
 look
 at
 a
 package


like
 that,
 if
 you
 compare
 it
 to
 other


CEOs,
 Zuck
 or
 whomever,
 different
 styles


of
 compensation,
 Bezos
 famously
 took
 no


compensation
 post
 the
 IPO.
 How
 do
 you


think
 about
 that
 as
 a
 motivating
 factor


or
 a
 necessary
 condition
 in
 2025
 to
 get


results?


>> I
 think
 it's
 huge.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 wish
 more


CEOs
 would
 do
 this.
 Elon's
 not
 going
 to


be
 paid
 unless
 unless
 he
 reaches
 these


milestones
 either.
 So
 I
 think
 it's
 very


motivating
 to
 him.
 I
 think
 it
 also,
 you


know,
 it's
 uh
 kind
 of
 an
 incentive
 to,


you
 know,
 shoot
 for
 the
 stars,
 but
 do
 it


in
 a
 a
 very
 first
 principles
 way.
 You


know,
 everything's
 physics-based
 and


everything's
 milestone
 based.
 And
 he's


very
 disciplined.
 If
 people
 do
 not
 know


that,
 they
 should.
 And
 when
 a
 milestone


misses
 way,
 he's
 in
 there
 on
 the
 floor.


>> Final
 quick
 question.
 As
 a
 stock
 picker,


do
 you
 care
 where
 the
 companies
 are


incorporated?
 Like
 do
 you
 look
 at


Delaware
 now
 and
 say
 there's
 fundamental


business
 risk.
 I
 need
 to
 sort
 of
 and
 or


andor
 do
 you
 cajol
 these
 folks
 now
 to


maybe
 reinccorporate
 in
 different


places?


>> We're
 not
 an
 activist
 investor.
 I
 have


to
 ve
 be
 very
 careful
 and
 say
 that
 we


are
 moving
 out
 of
 Delaware.
 Uh


>> you
 as
 your
 own
 business.
 Why?
 You
 don't


trust
 them
 to
 be
 predictable?
 Is
 that


the
 issue?
 They're
 not
 predictable
 now


and
 they're
 activist.


>> Activist.
 Activist.
 It's


>> in
 a
 bizarre
 way.


>> What
 business
 do
 they
 have
 overriding


the
 shareholders
 of
 Tesla
 when
 it
 comes


to
 a
 pay
 package?
 And
 all
 those


shareholders
 who
 did
 that
 drive
 by


lawsuit


>> twice.
 They
 did
 it
 twice.


>> Yes.


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 unbelievable
 that
 guy
 owned


10
 shares.
 He
 he
 did
 a
 20
 act
 20
 bagger


and
 then
 he's
 got
 the
 right
 to
 take


away.


>> It's
 like
 J
 suing
 Uber.
 Kathy,
 it's
 kind


of


>> Kathy
 Wood.


>> Kathy
 Wood,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


sharing
 so
 much
 knowledge.


>> You're
 amazing.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


taking
 the
 time.


Great
 to
 see
 you
 all.
 Thank
 you.
