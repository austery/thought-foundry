hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangin
 the
 CEO
 of


noris
 Bank
 investment
 management
 the


Norwegian
 someone
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today


we
 are
 joined
 by
 a
 true
 Visionary
 in
 the


world
 of
 Finance
 Mark
 Rowan
 who


co-founded
 Apollo
 Global
 Management


which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 influential


alternative
 Asset
 Management
 firms
 in


the
 world
 now
 we
 are
 the
 lucky
 owner
 of


just
 under
 2%
 of
 Apollo
 which
 works
 out


at
 just
 under
 one
 and
 a
 half
 billion


dollars
 Mark
 thrill
 to
 be
 here
 great


thanks
 thanks
 for
 coming
 and
 hopefully


you're
 a
 happy
 shareholder


Mark
 in
 um


1984
 you
 said
 God
 I'm
 just
 too
 late
 all


the
 money
 has
 been
 made
 you
 came
 out
 of


business
 school
 now
 a
 few
 years
 later
 uh


you
 have
 assets
 under
 management
 at


Apollo
 of
 680
 billion
 and
 the
 market
 cap


is
 more
 than
 80
 billion
 so
 I
 think
 we


can
 say
 that
 was
 a
 not
 a
 very
 accurate


statement
 well
 I
 I
 think
 it
 was
 accurate


because
 it
 reflected
 the
 business
 at
 the


time
 cuz
 not
 only
 did
 I
 say
 it
 in
 '
 84
 I


said
 it
 in
 90
 and
 I
 said
 it
 again
 in


2001
 and
 the
 point
 being
 in
 some
 ways
 I


was
 too
 late
 for
 the
 business
 that
 had


been
 done
 but
 the
 interesting
 thing
 part


of
 the
 interesting
 part
 of
 the
 job
 is
 it


keeps
 changing
 I
 mean
 you've
 2008
 we


were
 40
 billion
 of
 AUM
 in
 fact
 almost


every
 other
 large
 firm
 in
 our
 industry


today
 was
 roughly
 the
 same
 size
 and
 then


13
 14
 years
 later
 we're
 now
 up
 to
 over


700
 billion
 of
 AUM
 something
 changed


it's
 clearly
 not


as
 a
 result
 of
 our
 skill
 and
 talent
 we


had
 to
 be
 in
 the
 mainstream
 well
 skill


and
 talent
 helps
 right
 well
 look
 the


skill
 and
 talent
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 we're


positioned
 with
 Tailwinds
 behind
 us
 by


positioning
 the
 business
 the
 right
 way


but
 fundamental
 change
 is
 ultimately


what
 powered
 our
 business
 but
 if
 you
 go


back
 to
 uh
 your
 first
 job
 Drexel
 um


Drexel
 went
 bust
 in
 1990
 and
 then
 you


decided
 to
 found
 Apollo
 how
 what
 was
 the


thinking
 well
 it's
 uh
 founding
 a
 new


company
 the
 a
 great
 motivator
 is
 to
 be


unemployed
 so
 think
 of
 1990
 as
 2008
 uh


to
 be
 an
 unemployed
 investment
 banker
 in


the
 middle
 of
 a
 recession
 a
 financial


markets
 collapse
 New
 York
 banking
 crisis


Texas
 banking
 crisis
 a
 fundamental


change
 of
 the
 financial
 system
 was
 not
 a


great
 thing
 fortunately
 it
 was
 early
 in


my
 career
 and
 it
 was
 a
 great
 time
 to


just
 do
 something
 entrepreneurial
 what


does
 it
 take
 to
 start
 the
 firm
 it
 it


takes
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 luck
 look
 I
 had


spent
 the
 prior
 six
 years
 from
 84
 until


90
 mastering
 my
 craft
 so
 clearly
 I
 knew


something
 about
 the
 business
 but
 one
 has


to
 be
 humble
 and
 actually
 accept
 that


there's
 a
 fair
 degree
 of
 luck
 because
 I


was
 actually
 quite
 happy
 doing
 what
 I


was
 doing
 at
 Drexel
 burum
 in
 some
 ways


the
 single
 best
 thing
 that
 ever
 happened


to
 me
 was
 to
 be
 forced
 to
 make
 a
 change


do
 you
 think
 he
 would
 take
 the
 same
 type


of
 skill
 to
 setup
 today
 or
 is
 it
 a


different
 skill
 set
 required
 I
 think


it's
 well
 it
 depends
 on
 the
 scale
 of


your
 ambition
 today
 um
 if
 you
 look
 at


what's
 required
 today
 I
 I
 think
 it
 is


much
 much
 more
 difficult
 to
 set
 up
 a
 new


Financial
 Services
 firm
 in
 fact
 I
 think


the
 structure
 of
 the
 market
 today
 will


result
 in
 firms
 that
 are
 very
 small
 and


firms
 that
 are
 very
 large
 I
 think
 it
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 very
 tough
 place
 to
 be
 in


the
 middle
 in
 a
 few
 sentences
 what
 do


you
 actually
 do
 at
 a
 PO
 if
 you
 look
 at


them
 the
 best
 way
 to
 describe
 what
 we
 do


is
 to
 think
 about
 uh
 how
 we
 employ


people
 so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 asset


management
 business
 we
 are
 3,000
 people


in
 Asset
 Management
 then
 you
 look
 at
 the


Retirement
 Services
 business
 where
 1500


people
 in
 Retirement
 services
 and
 then


there
 are
 4,000
 other
 people
 at
 Apollo


who
 do
 not
 carry
 an
 Apollo
 business
 card


but
 instead
 originate
 credit
 what
 does


that
 mean
 well
 think
 about
 what
 the
 old


GE
 Capital
 was
 15
 or
 20
 years
 ago


certainly
 as
 I
 was
 coming
 up
 GE
 Capital


was
 thought
 of
 as
 the
 single
 best


originator
 of
 senior
 secured
 private


credit
 they
 used
 their
 expertise
 in
 and


medical
 devices
 and
 aircraft
 to
 become
 a


really
 good
 lender
 that's
 essentially


what
 we've
 done
 we
 have
 a
 fleet
 Finance


business
 we
 have
 an
 aircraft
 Finance


business
 we
 have
 a
 securitization


Finance
 business
 it
 is
 all
 about
 the


origination
 of
 credit
 because


origination
 is
 the
 lifeblood
 of
 our


business
 so
 you
 say
 what
 is
 Apollo
 today


Apollo
 is
 two
 businesses
 on
 the
 one
 hand


the
 business
 that
 is
 not
 as
 well
 known


is
 the
 Retirement
 Services
 business
 aen


2008
 would
 would
 use
 that
 up
 with


Partners
 yes
 but
 in
 2008
 we
 had
 an
 idea


to
 set
 up
 a
 new
 financial
 institution


and
 this
 financial
 institution
 was
 an


insurance
 company
 and
 the
 insurance


company
 did
 not
 ensure
 people's
 life


People's
 Health
 people's
 property
 it


only
 ensured
 their
 retirement
 that


business
 which
 was
 initially
 capitalized


with
 $16
 million
 is
 now
 with
 its


European
 affiliate
 now
 $400
 billion


growing
 70
 billion
 a
 year
 organically


and
 is
 by
 far
 the
 largest
 Retirement


services
 company
 in
 the
 world
 world
 and


it
 turns
 out
 what
 we
 did
 in
 that


business
 because
 if
 you
 think
 about
 what


retirement
 is
 it's
 essentially
 a
 fixed


income
 business
 people
 want
 guaranteed


lifetime
 income
 or
 guaranteed
 income
 for


a
 period
 of
 time
 or
 they're
 saving
 for


retirement
 or
 their
 pension
 needs
 to
 be


guaranteed
 to
 be
 in
 that
 business
 you


have
 to
 be
 very
 highly
 rated
 because


you're
 dealing
 with
 people's
 retirement


and
 therefore
 you
 have
 to
 have
 very
 safe


assets
 what
 we
 needed
 to
 be
 successful


in
 that
 business
 was
 investment
 grade


fixed
 income
 but
 with
 a
 spread
 and
 we


start
 with
 a
 baseline
 view
 that
 public


markets
 particularly
 public
 fixed
 income


Market
 markets
 offer
 no
 Alpha
 so
 if
 your


entire
 business
 model
 is
 dependent
 on


fixed
 income
 Alpha
 and
 there
 is
 none


what
 do
 you
 do
 well
 you
 build
 the


origination
 capability
 to
 service


initially
 yourself
 and
 that's
 what
 got


us
 into
 credit


origination
 and
 then
 you
 realize
 that


you
 want
 to
 be
 Diversified
 you
 don't


want
 100%
 of
 any
 risk
 you
 originate
 you


want
 25%
 of
 everything
 and
 100%
 of


nothing
 so
 we
 built
 a
 client
 business


side
 by
 side
 initially
 other
 other


insurance
 companies
 endowments
 Pension


funds
 individuals
 and
 a
 traditional


client
 base
 the
 capacity
 to
 originate


investment
 grade
 credit
 is
 at
 the
 heart


of
 what
 Apollo
 is
 so
 what
 are
 we
 we're
 a


Retirement
 Services
 insurance
 company


and
 then
 we're
 an
 asset
 manager
 the


asset
 management
 business
 though


reflects
 pretty
 much
 what
 I've
 just
 said


of
 the
 call
 it
 700
 billion
 550
 billion


is
 credit
 most
 of
 which
 is
 investment


grade
 and
 150
 billion
 is
 equity
 in
 two


flavors
 one
 a
 traditional
 private
 Equity


business
 which
 is
 about
 hundred
 billion


and
 the
 other
 a
 hybrid
 Equity
 business


hybrid
 not
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 Bank
 hybrids


but
 hybrid
 being
 the
 midpoint
 of
 risk


between
 debt
 and
 Equity
 Mark
 there's


been
 a
 lot
 of
 focus
 on
 how
 you
 are


replacing
 Banks
 through
 direct
 deals


with
 uh
 with
 companies
 now
 what
 kind
 of


um
 business
 are
 you
 uh
 in
 a
 way
 taking


away
 from
 the
 or
 uh
 doing
 instead
 of


them
 well
 I
 think
 it's
 actually
 a
 bit
 of


a
 misnomer
 the
 Press
 likes
 to
 report
 on


this
 notion
 of
 Banks
 and
 investors


fighting
 over
 private
 credit
 but
 I
 think


we
 have
 to
 start
 with
 a
 definition
 what


is
 private
 credit
 well
 for
 most
 people


it
 means
 levered
 lending
 or
 direct


lending
 which
 is
 a
 below
 investment


grade
 activity
 and
 yes
 it
 is
 true
 that


the
 vast
 majority
 of
 levered
 loans
 used


to
 be
 originated
 in
 the
 banking
 system


and
 now
 they
 are
 split
 between
 being


originated
 in
 the
 banking
 system
 and


being
 originated
 in
 the
 investment


Marketplace
 and
 yes
 we
 are
 engaged
 in


that
 business
 but
 it
 is
 a
 very
 small


part
 of
 our
 business
 I
 think
 generally


financial
 pundits
 and
 other
 Market


participants
 are
 M
 missing
 the
 bigger


Trend
 to
 me
 private
 credit
 encompasses


almost
 every
 asset
 on
 a
 bank
 balance


sheet
 a
 loan
 to
 a
 customer
 private
 a


loan
 to
 a
 company
 private
 a
 loan
 to
 a


project
 private
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 on
 and


the
 vast
 vast
 majority
 of
 private
 credit


is
 investment
 grade
 so
 we
 look
 and
 now


say
 are
 we
 replacing
 the
 banks
 generally


not
 you're
 also
 working
 with
 the
 banks


right
 you
 just
 said
 a
 big
 deal
 with
 City


Bank
 this
 is
 the
 this
 is
 the
 point
 and


again
 it
 will
 mix
 and
 match
 the
 a
 bank


is
 actually
 really
 really
 good
 at
 doing


some
 things
 think
 of
 it
 a
 bank
 is
 funded


short
 and
 lent
 long
 a
 bank
 is
 not
 a


great
 source
 of
 really
 long-term
 capital


and
 think
 about
 what
 we're
 borrowing


money
 for
 today
 we're
 borrowing
 money


for
 infrastructure
 for
 energy
 transition


for
 Next
 Generation
 data
 and
 power
 all


really
 long-term
 assets
 these
 are
 not


the
 ideal
 assets
 for
 a
 bank
 balance


sheet
 typically
 they
 would
 go
 to
 the


investment
 grade
 bond
 market
 but
 they


happen
 not
 to
 be
 great
 assets
 for
 the


investment
 grade
 bond
 market
 either


because
 they
 are
 generally
 complex


projects
 or
 structured
 in
 some
 way
 what


we
 are
 doing
 is
 we
 are
 matching
 really


long-term
 Insurance
 liabilities
 with


really
 long-term
 investment
 grade


counterparties
 in
 credit
 and
 becoming
 a


provider
 of
 capital
 because
 in
 almost


every
 Financial
 system
 there
 are
 only


two
 sources
 of
 credit
 it
 comes
 from
 the


banking
 system
 or
 from
 the
 investment


Marketplace
 there's
 no
 third
 choice


around
 the
 world
 for
 whatever
 reason


Regulators
 have
 decided
 that
 Banks


should
 do
 less
 and
 investors
 should
 do


more
 and
 of
 that
 piece
 that
 investors
 do


more
 the
 investment
 grade
 piece


particularly
 the
 piece
 that
 is
 not
 well


suited
 to
 the
 IG
 Public
 Market
 is
 what


we
 have
 really
 come
 to
 do
 very
 very
 well


what
 do
 banks
 do
 well
 banks
 are


operationally
 intensive
 shorter
 term


anything
 that
 is
 really
 operational
 or


client
 Centric
 the
 better
 picking
 credit


do
 you
 think
 I
 wouldn't
 think
 so
 our


credit
 record
 stands
 up
 uh
 to
 I'd
 say


any
 Bank
 out
 there
 but
 you
 would
 have


thought
 that
 during
 hundred
 years
 of


experience
 they
 would
 have
 learned


something
 that
 is
 not
 that
 easy
 to
 learn


in
 a
 10year
 period
 or
 my
 guess
 is
 the


same
 people
 who
 were
 there
 100
 years
 ago


are
 no
 longer
 here
 Nikolai
 and
 these
 are


all
 ultimately
 about
 people
 yeah
 and
 if


I
 think
 again
 I
 think
 about
 the


partnership
 that
 is
 evolving
 between


asset
 managers
 and
 investors
 excuse
 me


and


Banks
 thing
 I
 say
 to
 Banks
 we
 do
 not


want
 what
 the
 bank
 wants
 we
 don't
 want


the
 bank's
 client
 because
 if
 you
 think


about
 the
 structure
 of
 an
 asset
 manager


we
 want
 the
 asset
 we
 are
 incapable
 of


providing
 the
 client
 m&a
 advice
 Equity


advice
 Capital
 markets
 advice
 hedging


derivatives
 foreign
 exchange
 payments


custody
 credit
 cards
 this
 whole
 bundle


of
 services
 is
 not
 something
 that
 we
 can


provide
 nor
 is
 it
 something
 we
 want
 to


provide
 so
 the
 bank
 wants
 the
 client
 if


they
 lose
 a
 client
 to
 another
 bank
 they


lose
 all
 the
 services
 if
 a
 bank
 loses
 an


asset
 they
 just
 lose
 the
 asset
 and
 in


the
 new
 capital
 regimes
 in
 many


instances
 the
 banks
 no
 longer
 want
 the


asset
 when
 do
 you
 think
 you'll
 be
 fully


regulated
 why
 would
 we
 be
 fully


regulated
 why
 would
 Black
 Rock
 not
 be


fully
 regulated
 why
 would
 noris
 not
 be


fully
 regulated
 what
 is
 it
 we're
 we're


doing
 that
 gives
 rise
 to
 regulation
 and


I'll
 come
 back
 do
 we
 take
 deposits
 no
 do


we
 do
 maturity
 transformation
 no
 do
 we


have
 access
 to
 the
 treasury
 no
 but
 don't


you
 think
 at
 some
 stage
 um
 you
 need
 to


do
 you
 know
 for
 close
 on
 uh
 a
 big


company
 and
 uh
 The
 Regulators
 will
 be


quite
 upset
 and
 they
 would
 over
 regulate


like
 they
 do
 in
 many
 cases
 foreclose
 on


a
 big
 company
 I
 I
 don't
 really
 know
 what


that
 means
 so
 again
 think
 about
 what
 we


do
 we're
 at
 the
 investment
 grade
 end
 of


the
 marketplace
 if
 we're
 foreclosing
 in


the
 investment
 great
 end
 of
 the


marketplace
 I
 assure
 you
 there
 is


absolute
 chaos
 everywhere
 in
 the
 world


yeah
 foreclosing
 is
 something
 that
 Pimco


does
 that
 black
 rock
 does
 that
 Fidelity


does
 that
 everyone
 else
 does
 it
 is
 not


unique
 to
 Apollo's
 business
 model
 or


what
 we
 do
 an
 investment
 grade
 you
 would


expect
 it
 to
 be
 different
 I
 meet
 with


lots
 of
 regulators
 around
 the
 world
 and


I
 come
 back
 to
 this
 broader
 theme
 credit


can
 come
 from
 investors
 or
 Banks
 y
 in


the
 US
 Bank
 Landing
 is
 down
 to
 less
 than


30%
 of
 the
 overall
 Market
 in
 Europe
 it's


still
 65%
 in
 Europe
 they
 are
 squeezing


the
 banks
 harder
 than
 in
 the
 US
 bosel
 3


endgame
 and
 so
 on
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time


they
 have
 not
 liberalized
 on
 the


investor
 side
 it
 does
 not
 surprise
 me


that
 Europe
 suffers
 from
 a
 capital


deficit
 the
 US
 is
 by
 far
 this
 the


luckiest
 place
 in
 the
 world
 from
 a


capital
 markets
 point
 of
 view
 50%
 of
 the


world's
 capital
 is
 raised
 here
 the


diversity
 of
 sources
 so
 again
 think


about
 an
 investor
 every
 dollar
 that


moves
 out
 of
 the
 banking
 system


increases
 the
 resiliency
 of
 the
 system


and
 reduces
 The
 Leverage
 a
 bank
 is


levered
 12
 to
 14
 times
 an
 investor
 is


generally
 not
 levered
 at
 all
 reduction


in
 leverage
 and


diversity
 a
 bank
 borrows
 short
 and
 lends


long
 investors
 General
 borrow
 short


borrow
 long
 and
 lend


long
 there
 is
 no
 maturity
 transformation


there
 is
 no
 guarantee
 from
 treasury


there
 is
 no
 deposit
 but
 the
 thing
 that


always
 gets
 Regulators
 what
 percentage


of
 A
 bank's
 balance
 sheet
 in
 the
 US
 and


Europe
 for
 that
 matter
 is
 investment


grade
 60
 plus
 minus
 for
 us
 our
 balance


sheet
 better
 than
 90%
 plus
 investment


grade
 what
 about
 the
 uh
 business
 you


take
 from
 the
 public
 fixed
 income
 Market


uh
 I
 think
 I've
 heard
 you
 say
 that
 uh
 in


a
 little
 while
 we
 there
 will
 basically


be
 no
 difference
 between
 public
 and


private
 investment
 gr
 credit
 I
 I
 think


that
 is
 true
 I
 think
 that's
 where
 we're


heading
 um
 it
 does
 not
 but
 you
 have
 to


remember
 where
 we're
 starting
 from
 so


let's
 start
 with
 a


General
 calibration
 we
 used
 to
 have


8,000
 public
 companies
 in
 the
 US
 we
 now


have
 4,000
 public
 companies
 yeah
 we
 have


more
 companies
 going
 private
 than
 going


public
 I
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 a


short-term
 phenomenon
 this
 is
 a


long-term
 phenomenon
 80%
 of
 companies


over
 100
 million
 of
 Revenue
 are
 private


what
 percentage
 of
 capital
 should
 be


private
 a
 vast
 vast
 majority
 of
 it
 so


we're
 actually
 supporting
 the
 whole


private
 company


ecosystem
 do
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to


displace
 the
 public
 investment
 grade


Market
 no
 I
 don't
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 I


think
 it's
 important
 to
 put
 all
 of
 these


things
 in
 size
 perspective
 you
 have


black
 rock
 at
 11
 or
 12
 trillion
 you
 have


the
 mighty
 Apollo
 at
 700
 billion
 if


we're
 really
 really
 successful
 we
 will


be
 twice
 our
 size
 five
 years
 from
 now
 my


guess
 is
 you
 will
 have
 a
 series
 of
 asset


managers
 in
 the
 US
 that
 are
 20
 trillion


at
 that
 point
 in
 size
 we
 serve
 an


important
 but
 relatively
 small
 role
 in


the


economy
 and
 it's
 kind
 of
 what
 I
 like
 the


notion
 that
 our
 industry
 is
 not
 an
 asset


management
 industry
 an
 asset
 manager
 you


can
 give
 any
 amount
 of
 money
 and
 they


will
 invest
 it
 we
 can
 only
 invest
 it
 if


we
 can
 produce
 excess
 return
 Alpha
 we're


in
 the
 alpha
 generation
 business


absolutely
 now
 we
 are
 only
 in
 the
 public


market
 right
 it's
 not
 you
 know
 a
 mandate


to
 be
 in
 the
 private
 Market
 what
 are
 we


losing
 out
 on
 you're
 losing
 out
 on
 80%


of
 the
 investable
 market
 and
 if
 you


think
 about
 it
 public


markets
 do
 not
 work
 the
 way
 we
 think


they
 work
 in
 fact
 nothing
 works
 the
 way


we
 think
 it
 works
 so
 I
 look
 at
 public


markets
 today
 and
 I
 ask
 really


fundamental
 questions
 like
 in
 the
 US


which
 is
 the
 most
 developed
 of
 the


capital
 markets
 do
 we
 have
 price


Discovery
 in
 the
 short
 term
 I
 don't


think
 so
 think
 about
 what's
 happened
 in


US
 markets
 80%
 of


volume
 S&P
 500
 60
 plus
 perc
 of
 the


market
 passive
 10
 stocks
 39%
 of
 the
 S&P


four
 stocks
 have
 determined
 basically


profitability
 for
 the
 last
 four
 years


yeah
 one
 stock
 is
 larger
 than
 every


Public
 Market
 other
 than
 Japan
 that's


the
 universe
 you're
 going
 into
 so
 you


saying
 that
 um
 the
 public
 market
 is
 very


risky
 I'm
 not
 saying
 it's
 risky
 I'm


saying
 it's
 indexed
 and
 correlated
 and


it
 is
 about
 Capital
 flows
 now
 it
 is
 not


about
 price
 discovery
 of
 an
 individual


security
 in
 the
 short
 term
 think
 about


people
 who
 are
 supposed
 to
 be
 able
 to


outperform
 the
 index
 active
 managers
 how


have
 active
 managers
 done
 well
 basically


90
 plus%
 of
 the
 time
 for
 the
 past
 20


years
 they
 have
 failed
 to
 beat
 the
 index


did
 they
 get
 stupider
 no
 the
 structure


of
 our
 Market
 has
 changed
 it
 doesn't


mean
 bad
 it
 just
 means
 indexed
 and


correlated
 and
 so
 an
 investor


particularly
 an
 international
 investor


who
 wants
 to
 express
 an
 opinion
 in
 the


US
 no
 longer
 comes
 in
 and
 buys
 a
 basket


of
 Securities
 they
 buy
 the
 index
 now
 you


are
 also
 in
 the
 private
 Equity
 industry


or
 business
 and
 um
 done
 really
 really


well
 now
 um
 what
 are
 the
 trends
 you
 are


seeing
 here
 the
 Trends
 so
 this
 is
 about


reinvention
 as
 this
 is
 the
 business
 I


was
 referring
 to
 where
 in
 '
 84
 uh
 it
 was


done
 in
 90
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 on
 the


business
 continues
 to
 reinvest
 itself


but
 I
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 level
 set
 the


decade
 that
 has
 just
 passed
 I
 think
 is


going
 to
 turn
 out
 to
 be
 very


unusual
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 will
 be
 great


for
 investors
 I
 have
 forecast
 and
 I've


said
 publicly
 I
 think
 returns
 in


traditional
 private
 markets
 on
 existing


vintages
 of
 funds
 over
 done
 over
 the


past
 decade


will
 be
 low
 why
 people
 invested


generally
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 US


printing
 $8
 trillion
 following
 the


financial
 crisis
 and
 then
 following


covid
 and
 you
 had
 interest
 rates
 near


zero
 and
 so
 we
 have
 a
 very
 Pro
 cyclical


approach
 to
 private
 markets
 investing


60%
 of
 quote
 private
 Equity
 was
 actually


growth
 and
 many
 of
 the
 companies
 that


were
 purchased
 even
 if
 they
 were
 good


companies
 were
 purchased
 at
 relatively


high
 prices
 with
 capital
 structures


priced
 at
 very
 low
 prices
 that
 are
 now


going
 to
 be
 refinanced
 at
 much
 higher


rates
 given
 that
 holding
 periods
 will
 be


extended
 all
 of
 that
 tells
 me
 that


returns
 will
 go
 down
 so
 why
 should
 we


then
 go
 into
 private
 Equity
 this
 is
 well


let's
 let's
 go
 back
 the
 same
 is
 true
 for


public
 markets
 public
 markets
 have
 had


exactly
 the
 same
 but
 private
 Equity
 is


not
 the
 same
 for
 everyone
 you
 will
 find


a
 core
 group
 of
 firms
 that
 over
 the
 past


10
 years
 did
 not
 succumb
 to
 the
 the


benefits
 of
 lowc
 cost
 leverage
 and


reflect
 that
 impr
 price
 and
 I
 think


we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 ShakeOut


in
 our
 industry
 people
 who
 are
 giving


you
 in
 my
 term
 private
 markets
 beta
 I


think
 are
 going
 to
 be
 smaller
 going


forward
 they
 will
 be
 less
 successful
 and


people
 who
 really
 stuck
 to
 what
 they
 do


well
 giving
 you
 private
 markets
 Alpha
 I


think
 will
 continue
 to
 be
 very
 very


successful
 I
 believe
 that
 we
 will
 see
 a


ShakeOut
 and
 again
 my
 forecast
 for
 the


industry
 is
 that
 you
 will
 end
 up
 with


the
 large
 and
 the
 small
 I
 think
 the


middle
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 very
 very
 tough


place
 to
 be
 for
 a
 variety
 of
 reasons


what
 do
 you
 think
 would
 happen
 to


transparency
 ESG
 and
 fees
 in
 the
 private


Equity
 industry
 so
 fees
 have
 been


remarkably
 stable
 over
 a
 very
 very
 long


period
 of
 time
 and
 I
 expect
 fees
 to
 be


remarkably
 stable
 over
 a
 very
 very
 long


period
 of
 time
 I
 have
 said
 about
 the


industry
 in
 its
 traditional
 form
 that
 I


do
 not
 think
 it
 is
 a
 growth
 industry


because
 our
 job
 after
 all
 is
 to
 produce


Alpha
 in
 private
 markets


is
 very
 we
 are
 take
 Apollo
 for
 instance


we're
 a
 hundred
 billion
 do
 plus


franchise
 with
 a
 35-year
 history
 in
 this


marketplace
 with
 exceptional


returns
 we
 could
 we
 can't
 double
 the


size
 of
 our
 business
 nor
 do
 we
 even


think
 about
 it
 this
 business
 is
 run
 for


rate
 of
 return
 it
 is
 not
 run
 for
 growth


I
 think
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 our


competitors
 see
 the
 business
 similarly


that
 doesn't
 mean
 exactly
 the
 same
 and
 I


think
 the
 business
 will
 be
 roughly
 its


size
 in
 a
 traditional
 private
 Equity


format
 but
 I
 also
 think
 we're
 going
 to


have
 increased
 demand
 for
 private
 assets


I
 think
 that
 demand
 is
 going
 to
 come


from
 family
 offices
 it's
 coming
 from


individuals
 and
 it
 may
 in
 fact
 come
 from


Retirement
 Systems
 and
 it
 may
 in
 fact


come
 from
 401k
 it
 will
 depend
 on
 how
 the


regulatory
 situation
 here
 evolves
 my
 own


view
 is
 a
 relatively
 positive
 view
 of


private
 markets
 without
 regard
 to
 the


product
 for
 a
 period
 of
 time
 and
 I
 think


about
 the
 industry's
 history
 we


basically
 grew
 the
 private
 asset


industry
 the
 private
 markets
 industry


side
 by
 side
 with
 institutions
 but
 those


institutions
 funded
 it
 out
 of
 the


smallest
 part
 of
 their
 portfolio
 a


little
 office
 down
 the
 hall
 called


Alternatives
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 you
 have


another
 source
 of
 demand
 you
 have


individuals
 who
 have
 almost
 no
 exposure


to
 private
 assets
 who
 are
 roughly
 the


same
 size
 of
 Institutions
 who
 I
 believe


will
 also
 participate
 in
 that


Marketplace
 you
 then
 have
 Retirement


Systems
 and
 retirement
 plans
 looking
 to


provide
 retirement
 income
 who
 already


have
 been
 big
 buyers
 of
 private
 assets


primarily
 fixed
 income
 assets
 who
 are


expanding
 what
 they
 do
 as
 the
 population


ages
 and
 finally
 I
 think
 you
 have
 public


markets
 and
 private
 markets
 convergence


it's
 happening
 first
 in
 the
 debt
 Market


but
 I
 think
 it
 will
 eventually
 happen
 to


some
 extent
 in
 the
 equity
 market
 so


institutions
 who
 historically
 have


limited
 their
 participation
 in
 private


assets
 to
 their
 alternative


bucket
 that
 was
 done
 out
 of
 a
 mistaken


belief
 that
 private
 was
 risky
 and
 public


was
 safe
 what
 if
 that
 basic
 conception


is
 just
 wrong
 what
 if
 private
 is
 safe


and
 risky
 and
 public
 is
 safe
 and


risky
 why
 does
 the
 asset
 allocation
 of


private
 only
 and
 Alternatives
 make
 any


sense
 well
 it
 doesn't
 I
 think
 we
 will


rethink
 the
 whole
 notion
 of
 asset


allocation
 and
 I
 can
 see
 it
 happening
 in


real
 time
 in
 fixed
 income
 fixed
 income


historically
 for
 institutional
 clients


has
 been
 100%
 investment
 grade
 and
 100%


public
 I
 see
 institutions
 now
 dividing


that
 that
 same
 fixed
 income
 allocation


between
 beta
 Public
 Market
 IG
 and
 Alpha


private
 Market
 IG
 and
 it's
 happening
 in


family
 office
 it's
 happening
 in
 Pension


funds
 it's
 happening
 endowments
 it's


happening
 in
 Sovereign
 wealth
 funds
 and


the
 reason
 it's
 happening
 in
 fixed


income
 first
 is
 you
 have
 external


Gatekeepers
 rating
 agencies
 they
 can


actually
 tell
 a
 portfolio
 manager
 your


portfolio
 is
 in
 a
 this
 is
 an
 a
 they
 are


of
 the
 same
 risk
 now
 you're
 just
 making


a
 a
 determination
 as
 to
 liquidity
 and


how
 much
 rate
 of
 return
 you
 want
 for
 a


little
 less
 liquidity
 oh
 and
 by
 the
 way


there
 is
 no
 liquidity
 in
 public
 fixed


income
 markets
 and
 um
 given
 that
 a
 lot


of
 capital
 is
 moving
 over
 to
 the
 private


Market
 what
 what
 are
 the
 implications


for
 the
 liquidity
 and
 how
 will
 that
 pan


out
 also
 investment
 banks
 are
 using
 less


uh
 capital
 for
 Market
 making
 uh
 you
 have


different
 types
 of
 rules
 for
 banks
 etc


etc
 so
 the
 answer
 is
 the
 change
 has


already
 happened
 in
 2008
 but
 we
 haven't


seen
 the
 application
 we
 haven't
 seen
 it


really
 stress
 tested
 oh
 we
 have
 we've


seen
 it
 twice
 we've
 seen
 it
 we
 saw
 it
 in


covid
 where
 ETFs
 in
 fixed
 income
 almost


broke
 and
 we
 saw
 it
 in
 the
 UK
 and
 ldi


yeah
 we
 should
 expect
 so
 here's
 the


setup
 2008
 part
 of
 the
 regulatory
 reform


was
 to
 penalize
 those
 who
 made
 markets


and
 held
 Market
 making
 Capital
 within


the
 banking
 system
 particularly
 for


fixed
 income
 there
 is
 roughly
 10%
 of
 the


amount
 of
 capital
 for
 fixed
 income


Market
 making
 today
 as
 there
 was
 in
 2008


and
 the
 market
 is
 three
 times
 its
 size


and
 so
 what
 will
 so
 when
 will
 we
 see


that
 so
 let's
 say
 we
 have
 some
 type
 of


Crash
 yeah
 but
 I
 mean
 in
 in
 a
 bigger


scale
 the
 the
 next
 time
 we
 get
 a


significant
 riskof
 event
 my
 own
 view
 is


we
 should
 expect
 little
 to
 no
 liquidity


in
 publicly
 traded
 fixed
 income
 today
 in


the
 best
 of
 times
 in
 the
 most
 liquid


Market
 takes
 5
 days
 to
 sell
 an


investment
 grade
 corporate
 bond
 what
 can


we
 expect
 when
 it
 goes
 in
 the
 other


direction


and
 so
 private
 markets
 today
 in


investment
 grade
 don't
 trade
 okay
 you're


going
 to
 see
 liquidity
 come
 into
 private


markets
 that
 will
 mean
 for
 private


markets
 everyday
 liquidity
 everyday


pricing
 everyday
 price
 Discovery
 if
 you


think
 about
 investment
 grade
 at
 least


you
 will
 have
 the
 same
 issuers
 the
 same


ratings
 the
 same
 size
 and
 you
 will
 have


similar
 liquidity
 over
 time
 my
 gut
 tells


me
 over
 the
 next
 18
 months
 investors


will
 really
 coal
 us
 around
 this
 idea
 of


fixed
 income
 and
 dividing
 it
 between


Alpha
 and
 beta
 eventually
 I
 don't
 think


change
 is
 going
 to
 stop
 at
 fixed
 income


I
 think
 it's
 coming
 for
 Equity
 as
 well


as
 I
 said
 when
 I
 was
 in
 Oslo
 I
 think


investors
 including
 institutions
 like


yours
 you
 may
 not
 own
 private
 Equity
 but


you
 will
 own
 Equity
 that
 is
 private
 you


you
 may
 or
 and
 many
 do
 already
 they
 own


Spotify
 they
 own
 open
 AI
 they
 own
 any


number
 of
 tech
 companies
 that
 have


remained
 private
 well
 why
 should
 it
 stop


there
 I
 think
 there'll
 be
 50
 or
 100


companies
 that
 are
 private
 for
 which


Equity
 can
 be
 raised
 maybe
 that
 is
 the


new
 form
 of
 active
 management
 active


ownership
 of
 companies
 or
 PE
 without
 the


leverage
 and
 without
 the
 fund
 that's


that's
 a
 ways
 out
 still
 the
 next
 five


years
 is
 going
 to
 be
 about
 fixed
 income


replacement
 now
 you're
 um
 uh
 listed


company
 and
 uh
 but
 your
 uh
 your
 target


is
 a
 to
 generate
 returns
 for
 your


investors
 so
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 um


look
 at
 that
 kind
 of
 uh
 well
 trade-off


or
 not
 tradeoff
 between
 generating


assets
 which
 is
 what
 the
 public
 market


listing
 wants
 you
 to
 do
 or
 generating


returns
 so
 I
 think
 if
 you
 follow
 the


generation
 of
 assets
 and
 that
 is
 your


only
 goal
 you'll
 destroy
 the
 business
 I


come
 back
 to
 the
 basis
 on
 which
 we
 run


this
 business
 uh
 we
 run
 it
 at
 least
 at


Apollo
 on
 three
 fundamental
 principles


the
 first
 is
 everything
 is
 one
 strategy


at
 Apollo
 it's
 all
 purchase
 price


matters
 in
 equity
 we
 think
 of
 that
 as


value
 in
 fixed
 income
 we
 think
 of
 that


as
 protection
 of
 principle
 and
 getting


return
 not
 necessarily
 through
 credit


selection
 or
 reaching
 down
 the
 capital


structure
 but
 through
 structure
 and


origination
 um
 the
 second
 is
 we
 are
 not


an
 asset
 manager
 we
 are
 a
 source
 of


alpha
 excess
 return
 per
 unit
 of
 risk
 I'm


sorry
 wouldn't
 all
 asset
 managers
 say


that
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 think
 so
 someone
 who


is
 a
 passive
 asset
 manager
 who
 has


scaled
 massively
 in
 the
 ETF
 business


their
 job
 is
 to
 give
 you
 beta
 really


efficient
 we
 really
 well-run
 really


lowcost
 well
 reported
 beta
 that
 is
 the


vast
 Mass
 majority
 of
 public
 markets


today
 our
 job
 is
 to
 give
 you
 Alpha
 we


are
 therefore
 limited
 in
 our
 growth
 by


our
 capacity
 to
 generate
 Alpha
 if
 we


take
 in
 too
 much
 in
 the
 way
 of
 assets
 we


will
 dilute
 our
 returns
 and
 ultimately


create
 negative
 impact
 for
 our
 business


let's
 spend
 some
 time
 on
 the
 alpha


side
 so
 is
 there
 such
 a
 thing
 as
 an


Apollo
 investment
 philosophy


there
 is
 it's
 and
 I
 I've
 said
 it
 it's


purchase
 price
 matters
 so
 what
 does
 it


mean
 this
 is
 so
 there
 are
 lots
 of


strategies
 that
 one
 can
 employ
 there's


someone
 who's
 a
 great
 internationalist


there's
 someone
 who's
 a
 great
 macr


Trader
 there's
 someone
 who's
 great
 at


chasing
 growth
 we
 are
 great
 at
 finding


value
 sometimes
 that
 value
 comes
 from


Trading
 hard
 work
 for
 purchase
 price
 as


in
 our
 private
 Equity
 portfolio
 and


asset
 management
 but
 if
 you
 translate
 it


over
 to
 fixed
 income
 it's
 finding
 exess


return
 per
 unit
 of
 risk
 so
 how
 do
 we
 get


paid
 more
 for
 a
 single
 a
 rated
 company


from
 a
 single
 a
 rated
 company
 than
 they


could
 otherwise
 get
 in
 the
 public


Marketplace
 has
 the
 investment


philosophy
 changed
 since
 you
 started
 the


firm
 it
 has
 not
 changed
 in
 a
 very
 very


long
 you
 think
 it
 will
 do
 you
 think
 it


will
 change
 I
 do


not
 has
 it
 ever
 been
 difficult
 to
 stay


true
 to
 the
 philosophy
 oh
 it's
 been
 very


difficult
 uh
 especially
 when
 the
 US
 is


printing
 8
 trillion
 dollar
 over
 a
 period


of
 time
 and
 random
 companies
 have


multibillion
 valuations
 overnight
 so


what
 do
 you
 do
 now
 then
 uh
 what
 do
 you


do
 then
 you
 you
 try
 to
 manage
 a
 lot
 of


type
 A
 personalities
 and
 convince
 them


that
 doing
 nothing
 is
 the
 best
 thing
 and


how
 do
 you
 do
 that
 so
 you
 have
 so
 you


have
 some
 Ambitions
 you've
 been
 to
 the


circus
 where
 they
 have
 the
 lion
 tamer
 uh


so
 you
 so
 you
 you
 hire
 this
 person
 like


straight
 out
 of
 uh
 you
 know
 Wharton


where
 we
 actually
 both
 went
 to
 school
 uh


they're
 very
 keen
 on
 kind
 of
 Conquering


the
 world
 and
 there
 you
 are
 Mar
 Mark


Rowan
 holding
 the
 backc
 yes
 and
 how
 easy


is
 that
 it's
 actually
 quite
 easy
 because


it's
 not
 it's
 not
 just
 Mark
 Rowan
 it's


the
 whole
 firm
 we've
 all
 grown
 up
 in


this
 culture
 we've
 grown
 up
 this
 way


it's
 not
 me
 against
 the
 firm
 it
 actually


everyone
 has
 been
 around
 long
 enough
 to


understand
 what
 our
 job
 is
 and
 we
 accept


that
 there
 are
 periods
 of
 time
 when
 we


will
 not
 grow
 as
 fast
 and
 there
 are


periods
 of
 time
 that
 we
 will
 grow
 very


very
 fast
 but
 fundamentally
 this
 is


about
 making
 your
 own
 luck
 I'll
 come


back
 to
 a
 a
 a
 different
 way
 of
 thinking


about
 our
 business
 which


it'll
 be
 challenging
 for
 a
 second
 how


important
 is
 investment
 Talent
 versus


culture
 and
 system
 giving
 this
 it
 it's


it's
 all
 part
 of
 something
 there
 there's


lots
 of
 talented
 people
 but
 retaining


let's
 go
 to
 the
 a
 more
 fundamental


because
 you're
 getting
 a
 a
 more


fundamental
 what
 do
 we
 offer
 people
 what


do
 we
 offer
 a
 client
 we
 offer
 them


judgment
 there's
 no
 secret
 sauce
 there's


no
 you
 know
 algorithm
 in
 the
 back
 room


it's
 judgment
 how
 do
 you
 get
 judgment
 I


think
 you
 get
 it
 over
 a
 long
 period
 of


time
 seeing
 what
 we
 do
 and
 don't
 do
 a


variety
 of
 challenging
 and
 not
 so


challenging
 circumstances
 that
 implies


that
 I
 need
 you
 to
 spend
 your
 career
 at


Apollo
 how
 do
 I
 do
 that
 well
 I
 need
 to


make
 this
 place
 the
 single
 best
 place
 to


be
 a
 partner
 in
 financial
 services
 and


that
 is
 my
 North
 Star
 because
 if
 I
 do


that
 I
 will
 retain
 you
 for
 your
 whole


career
 there
 are
 200
 Partners
 at
 Apollo


and
 I
 wish
 all
 200
 wanted
 the
 same
 thing


Unfortunately
 they
 want
 200
 things
 some


mix
 of
 Merit
 compensation
 culture


environment
 purpose
 and
 20
 other


intangibles
 so
 so
 you
 off
 you
 offer


clients
 and
 your
 people
 judge
 judgment


right
 people
 offer
 the
 Judgment
 our


clients
 are
 the
 beneficiaries
 of
 our


judment
 you
 offer
 your
 clients's


judgment
 now
 how
 is
 that
 judgment


different
 from
 the
 Blackstone
 judgment


eqt
 judgment
 KKR
 judgment
 everyone
 has
 a


a
 slight
 difference
 or
 more
 than
 a


slight
 difference
 in
 the
 way
 they
 do


they
 do
 business
 the
 firms
 although


they're
 all
 in
 the
 quote
 alternative


asset
 manag
 industry
 are
 actually
 quite


different
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 deals
 they


pursue
 how
 they're
 structured
 and
 over


time
 we've
 become
 more
 different
 rather


than
 more
 similar
 our
 business
 today
 is


one
 of
 one
 no
 one
 actually
 looks
 like
 we


do
 today
 I'll
 describe
 the
 setup
 yeah


what
 is
 an
 Apollo
 deal
 what
 does
 it
 well


let's
 start
 with
 a
 let's
 start
 with
 a


more
 basic
 if
 we're
 700
 billion
 of
 AUM


which
 is
 approximately
 where
 we
 were
 at


year
 end
 350
 billion
 of
 that
 was
 our
 own


balance
 sheet
 350
 billion
 of
 that
 was


client
 money
 we
 are
 generally
 the


largest
 buyer
 of
 everything
 the
 person


that
 is
 most
 impacted
 by
 growing
 too


fast
 is
 us
 it
 is
 a
 wonderful
 way
 to
 be


aligned
 with
 your
 clients
 from
 a
 from
 a


growth
 point
 of
 view
 and
 from
 an


investment
 point
 of
 view
 and
 that
 is
 the


third
 precept
 if
 the
 first
 is
 purchase


price
 matters
 and
 the
 second
 is
 excess


return
 per
 unit
 of
 risk
 the
 third
 is


alignment
 no
 one
 looks
 the
 way
 we
 look


today
 that
 implies
 other
 things
 we
 also


manage
 a
 disproportionate
 amount
 of


fixed
 income
 550
 billion
 of
 fixed
 income


versus
 150
 billion
 of
 equity
 our


business
 is
 set
 up


differently
 what's
 been
 interesting


about
 this
 is
 people
 this
 industry


Started
 With
 Private
 Equity
 almost
 for


every
 firm
 you've
 mentioned
 private


Equity
 is
 a
 very
 expensive
 cost
 of


capital
 think
 of
 it
 as
 a
 20%
 plus
 rate


of
 return
 that
 is
 required
 how
 many


companies
 in
 the
 world
 with
 leverage
 can


are
 appropriate
 for
 that
 high
 cost
 of


capital
 the
 answer
 is
 a
 few
 but
 maybe


the
 pile
 is
 about
 this
 High
 over
 time


what
 we've
 done
 is
 we've
 taken
 our
 skill


set
 our
 ability
 to
 originate
 our
 ability


to
 analyze
 our
 ability
 to
 Source
 our


ability
 to
 discern
 and
 we've
 extended
 it


from
 investment
 grade
 to
 lever
 Equity


we've
 actually
 lowered
 our
 cost
 of


capital
 substantially
 over
 time
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 average
 investment
 Apollo


makes
 today
 probably
 has
 a
 six
 or
 7%


cost
 of
 capital
 very
 heavily
 tilted
 to


investment
 grade
 that's
 a
 reflection
 now


you're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 of
 where
 the


world
 is
 so
 I
 start
 with
 questions
 back


is
 the
 world
 cheap
 today
 no
 is
 risk


being
 rewarded
 today
 no
 spreads
 are


tight
 in
 a
 world
 with
 geopolitical
 risk


where
 valuations
 are
 high
 and
 spreads


are
 tight
 why
 would
 I
 want
 to
 take
 lots


of
 risk
 today
 there'll
 be
 a
 time
 to
 take


risk
 after
 financial
 markets
 correct
 at


some
 point
 they
 always
 do
 that'll
 be
 a


time
 when
 we
 want
 to
 take
 risk
 but
 if


you're
 looking
 for
 the
 Apollo
 DNA
 and


Apollo


philosophy
 excess
 return
 per
 unit
 of


risk
 so
 this
 is
 a
 time
 where
 you're


holding
 back
 a
 bit
 we're
 definitely


holding
 back
 in
 adjusting
 how
 we
 invest


right
 now
 we
 want
 return
 so
 if
 I
 give


you
 the
 credit
 Market
 return
 reaching


down
 the
 capital
 structure
 and
 taking


more
 subordinated
 risk
 feels
 like
 a
 bad


bad
 idea
 today
 right
 using
 your
 people


and
 your
 resources
 to
 get
 paid
 for


origination
 and
 structure
 but
 being


senior
 in
 the
 capital
 structure
 feels


like
 a
 tremendously
 good
 use
 of
 time


right
 and
 that's
 what
 we've
 been
 doing


so
 you're
 playing
 it
 safe
 a
 bit
 like


Warren
 Buffett
 who
 is
 racing
 cash
 last
 I


looked
 he's
 lived
 a
 long
 time
 in
 a
 very


happy


way
 what
 are
 the
 main
 risks
 in
 these


markets
 and
 what
 what
 could
 trigger


something
 more
 more
 serious
 so
 I
 look
 at


the
 risk
 today
 look
 the
 the
 risks
 in


front
 of
 us
 in
 in
 some
 way
 are
 obvious


we
 have
 geopolitics
 as
 one
 of
 the
 most


overriding
 risks
 but
 not
 even


geopolitics
 politics
 I
 mean
 we
 right
 now


in
 the
 US
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 things
 feel


great


not
 only
 do
 we
 have
 growth
 and
 we
 have


very
 low
 unemployment
 we
 have
 a
 backlog


of
 fiscal
 stimulus
 that
 hasn't
 even
 hit


yet
 three
 years
 ago
 we
 passed
 nearly
 2


trillion
 in
 infrastructure
 bill
 it's


still
 being
 built
 nothing's
 built
 yet


two
 years
 ago
 $52
 billion
 for


Semiconductor
 plants
 not
 a
 single
 plant


has
 open
 yet
 a
 year
 ago
 inflation


reduction
 act
 to
 encourage
 manufacturing


of
 EVs
 and
 other
 things
 here
 not
 a


single
 plant
 open
 last
 three
 years
 in
 a


row
 we've
 been
 the
 largest
 recipient
 of


foreign
 direct
 investment
 and
 we're
 r
 in


defense
 production
 all
 of
 those
 things


are
 fiscally
 stimulative
 against
 a


backdrop
 of
 no
 legal
 immigration
 that
 is


a
 pretty
 good
 setup
 we've
 raised
 rates


500
 basis
 points
 what
 happened
 home


prices
 went
 up
 stocks
 went
 up
 Capital


markets
 are
 fully
 liquid
 this
 is
 a


pretty
 good
 setup
 oh
 by
 the
 way
 we're


we're
 have
 a$2
 trillion
 deficit
 in
 peace


time
 with
 a
 4%


unemployment
 that's
 a
 worry
 so
 one
 can


look
 at
 geopolitics


one
 can
 look
 at
 politics
 or
 governance


as
 another
 and
 how
 how
 big
 a
 Warriors


deficit
 to
 me
 um
 it
 doesn't
 it's
 not
 a


short-term
 worry
 but
 it
 is
 ultimately
 a


long-term
 worry
 how
 could
 it
 turn
 into
 a


short-term
 worry
 um
 usually
 these
 things


turn
 into
 a
 short-term
 worry
 about
 bond


market
 reaction
 eventually
 the
 bond


market
 tends
 to
 be
 the
 discipline


disciplinarian
 for
 the
 world
 how
 do
 we


know
 that
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 kick
 in
 soon


we
 we
 don't
 these
 are
 that's
 why
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 worry
 but
 let
 me
 come
 to
 another


worry
 look
 these
 are
 things
 how
 do
 you


protect
 yourself
 in
 these
 environments


well
 you
 protect
 yourself
 by
 being
 top


of
 the
 capital
 structure
 senior
 secur


and
 credit
 markets
 and
 you
 protect


yourself
 in
 equity
 markets
 by
 trying
 not


to
 buy
 into
 Trends
 not
 to
 pay
 massive


prices
 for
 things
 that
 may
 in
 fact
 be


supported
 by
 a
 liquidity
 bubble
 but
 what


else
 worries
 me
 indexation
 and


correlation
 think
 about
 what's
 happened


in
 the
 world
 everyone
 is
 now
 indexed
 to


the
 same
 trade
 we
 saw
 the
 in
 UK
 ldi
 ldi


was
 not
 some
 crazy
 thing
 UK
 institutions


were
 doing
 it's
 just
 that
 everyone
 owned


the
 same
 risk
 at
 the
 same
 time
 in
 the


same
 way
 and
 thought
 they
 would
 be
 able


to
 sell
 their
 AAA
 and
 double
 A
 Holdings


to
 meet
 margin
 calls
 guess
 what
 they


couldn't
 isn't
 that
 the
 setup
 of
 the


whole
 world
 today
 the
 vast
 vast
 majority


of
 public
 markets
 daily
 liquid
 daily


liquid
 seems
 to
 me
 to
 be
 the
 biggest


imbalance
 that
 we
 have
 anywhere
 in
 the


world
 you're
 not
 daily
 liquid
 because


you
 have
 a
 long-term
 point
 of
 view
 and


what
 you
 do
 we're
 not
 daily
 liquid


because
 we
 manage
 for
 generally


long-term
 institutions
 but
 the
 vast


majority
 of
 money
 that's
 out
 there
 is


daily
 liquid
 think
 about
 what
 we've
 done


with
 the
 largest
 pool
 of
 capital


anywhere
 in
 the
 world
 in
 the
 US
 we
 have


12
 to
 13
 trillion
 in


401K
 these
 are
 people
 who
 need


retirement
 Money
 Retirement
 savings
 more


than
 anyone
 else
 in
 the
 world
 Returns


what
 do
 we
 have
 them
 invested
 in
 yeah


daily
 liquid
 generally
 index
 funds
 for


50
 years
 why
 well
 a
 belief
 that
 private


is
 risky
 and
 public
 is
 safe
 a
 notion


that
 you
 need
 daily
 liquidity
 in
 a


50-year
 asset
 class
 things
 we
 do
 just


don't
 make
 sense
 and
 they
 don't
 make


sense
 in
 the
 context
 of
 the
 financial


Market
 the
 way
 it
 exists
 today
 versus


the
 way
 it
 might
 have
 existed
 years
 ago


as
 you
 know
 as
 a
 student
 of
 History


public
 financial
 markets
 are
 a


relatively
 new
 phenomenon
 in
 the
 history


of
 mankind
 most
 markets
 were
 private


over
 a
 very
 very
 long
 period
 of
 time
 I'm


not
 saying
 one
 is
 better
 or
 worse
 and


clearly
 private
 public
 markets
 have
 done


awesome
 goodly
 good
 things
 for
 the
 world


but
 indexation
 and


correlation
 I
 do
 not
 think
 are
 our


friend
 in
 periods
 of
 volatility
 Mark
 uh


changing
 t
 a
 bit
 here
 uh
 let's
 talk


about
 leadership
 if
 I
 asked
 your


colleagues
 and
 uh
 and
 employees
 uh
 about


your
 leadership
 style
 what
 would
 they


say
 hopefully
 they
 would
 say
 nice
 things


but
 I
 also
 I
 I
 get
 uh
 a
 an
 update
 on
 my


leadership
 style
 every
 six
 months
 and


how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 get
 that
 uh
 I
 I


get
 formal
 feedback
 and
 the
 nice
 thing


about
 the
 group
 at
 Apollo
 is
 they
 are


not
 shy
 they
 are
 very
 generous
 uh
 with


their
 feedback
 what
 do
 they
 say
 uh
 they


ackowledge
 my
 strengths
 and
 also
 my


weaknesses
 what
 are
 your


weaknesses
 it's
 a
 long
 list
 Nikolai
 I'm


not
 sure
 look
 we
 what
 are
 you
 what
 are


you
 working
 on
 I
 mean
 what
 are
 you


trying
 to
 improve
 with
 your
 leadership


style
 so
 let's
 let's
 start
 with
 what


okay
 I'll
 go
 there
 instead
 what
 we
 have


to
 do
 I
 Believe
 As
 Leaders
 I'm
 a
 servant


leader
 you're
 a
 servant
 leader
 you
 gave


up
 what
 you
 were
 doing
 to
 be
 servant


leader
 I
 gave
 up
 what
 I
 was
 doing
 to
 be


a
 servant
 leader
 I
 used
 to
 think
 doing


anything
 I
 was
 actually
 quite
 good
 at


doing
 things
 now
 I
 do
 nothing
 and
 that


doesn't
 literally
 mean
 nothing
 but
 I


know
 if
 I
 do
 something
 I
 have
 to
 do
 it


again
 whereas
 if
 I
 create
 a
 culture
 of


letting
 my
 team
 succeed
 they
 get
 to
 do


it
 they
 paint
 my
 fence
 for
 me
 my
 job
 is


to
 make
 their
 job
 easier
 and
 I've


accepted
 that
 so
 I
 look
 at
 what
 I'm


trying
 to
 do
 here
 half
 my
 day
 is


managing
 the
 careers
 of
 two
 people


because
 I
 can't
 run
 this
 firm
 by
 myself


it
 is
 way
 too
 big
 a
 firm
 I
 need
 the
 200


partners
 of
 Apollo
 to
 run
 this
 firm
 if
 I


have
 them
 focused
 in
 the
 right
 direction


and
 I
 have
 their
 Buy
 in
 everything
 works


because
 the
 people
 who
 are
 coming
 up
 in


our
 firm
 and
 see
 200
 Partners
 who
 are


here
 for
 their
 careers
 they
 realize
 it's


worthwhile
 the
 Young
 Generation
 who
 are


working
 really
 hard
 now
 have
 two
 amazing


generations
 of
 mentors
 in
 front
 of
 them


it
 all
 works
 if
 the
 200
 partners
 are
 not


happy
 and
 we
 end
 up
 with
 turnover
 it's


very
 hard
 to
 run
 a
 knowledge-based


business
 where
 knowledge
 keeps
 leaving
 I


think
 that's
 what
 we're
 seeing
 in
 lots


of
 financial
 institutions
 today
 so
 what


am
 I
 working
 on
 I
 never
 really


understood
 how
 important
 the
 cultural


side
 of
 this
 the
 Judgment
 side
 of
 this


the
 partnership
 side
 of
 it
 was
 but
 boy


isn't
 important
 that's
 a
 big
 part
 of
 my


day
 the
 second
 um
 I
 had


spent
 most
 of
 my
 career
 trying
 to
 avoid


speaking
 to
 the
 Press
 I
 just
 never
 saw


the
 utility
 of
 it
 the
 notion
 of
 how
 you


now
 we
 have
 gotten
 to
 a
 size
 in
 our


industry
 where
 we
 need
 to
 communicate


well
 we
 even
 need
 to
 do
 podcasts
 we
 even


need
 to
 do
 podcast
 but
 by
 the
 way


podcast
 is
 the
 single
 best
 form
 of
 doing


this
 but
 which
 is
 why
 it's
 become


increasingly
 popular
 right
 because
 you


get
 time
 to
 explain
 you
 get
 time
 to


explain
 and
 you
 also
 generally
 are


talking
 to
 someone
 who
 is
 not
 pressed


for
 time
 who
 has
 had
 the
 benefit
 of


looking
 at
 what
 you
 do
 and
 has
 the


history
 and
 is
 asking
 questions
 and


engaged
 in
 the
 dialogue
 not
 just
 to


flatter
 you
 no
 but
 it's
 it's
 interesting


how
 it
 became
 very
 important
 in
 the
 US


you
 know
 uh
 election
 compan
 yes
 but


communicating
 with
 Regulators


communicating
 with
 our
 peers


communicating
 with
 competitors
 and
 most


importantly
 communicating
 a
 clear


strategy
 to
 our
 employees
 so
 that


everyone
 knows
 what's
 expected
 of
 them


we've
 just
 come
 through
 an
 investor
 day


really
 important
 process
 for
 us
 everyone


who
 will
 join
 Apollo
 from
 this
 point


forward
 will
 see
 the
 three
 or
 four
 hours


that
 we've
 put
 together
 and
 so
 the


amount
 of
 time
 that
 we
 take
 to
 actually


articulate
 our
 strategy
 look
 I
 I
 wish
 I


could
 keep
 our
 strategy
 to
 ourselves
 and


keep
 it
 a
 big
 secret
 but
 that
 just


doesn't
 work
 anymore
 no
 now
 I'm
 not
 sure


we
 really
 touched
 on
 your
 weaknesses
 but


uh
 but
 hey
 uh
 what
 are
 your


strengths
 um
 from
 a
 strength's
 point
 of


view
 I
 think
 I
 have
 done
 a
 good
 job


positioning
 the
 company
 in
 front
 of


Tailwinds
 yeah
 and
 really
 stepping
 back


and
 trying
 to
 challenge
 coming
 into
 the


office
 each
 day
 and
 just
 doing
 the
 same


thing
 something
 tells
 me
 and
 I
 tell
 the


team
 what
 got
 us
 over
 the
 past
 10
 years


is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 what
 gets
 us
 where
 we


need
 to
 go
 going
 forward
 we
 are
 going
 to


have
 to
 accept
 the
 markets
 have
 changed


that
 our
 role
 in
 these
 markets
 have


changed
 that
 the
 products
 that
 we


currently
 think
 of
 as
 immutable
 are
 not


immutable
 think
 about
 your
 career
 and
 my


career
 I
 started
 no
 howo
 bonds
 no
 Leever


loans
 no
 ETFs
 and
 minimal
 securitization


we
 take
 for
 granted
 that
 those
 products


are
 mainstream
 trust
 me
 we're
 going
 to


have
 in
 10
 years
 from
 now
 new
 products


that
 we
 never
 thought
 of
 the
 history
 of


our
 financial
 services
 business
 are
 you


going
 to
 invent
 them
 I
 hope
 we
 have
 a


hand
 in
 them
 and
 boy
 are
 we
 trying
 hard


to
 really
 anticipate
 where
 we
 think


markets
 are
 going
 the
 terms
 that
 we've


used
 origination
 fixed
 income


replacement
 these
 are
 now
 terms
 in
 our


industry
 that
 did
 not
 exist
 before


Equity
 replacement
 Market
 making
 for


private
 assets
 we
 try
 to
 be
 at
 the


Forefront
 of
 everything
 that's
 going
 on


and
 I
 hope
 we
 are
 talking
 about
 uh
 where


working
 hard
 um
 what
 does
 a
 day
 look


like
 when
 do
 you
 wake
 up
 uh
 I'm
 up
 at
 5:


almost
 every
 day
 right
 what
 do
 you
 do


well
 if
 I
 don't
 exercise
 at
 5:30
 it


doesn't
 happen
 right
 so
 generally
 I
 try


to
 exercise
 5:30
 to
 6:30
 and
 to
 be
 in


the
 office
 sometime
 just
 after
 7
 coffee


before
 off
 the
 workout
 yes


both
 and
 if
 I'm
 gym
 at
 home
 uh
 I
 do
 and


if
 I'm
 in
 the
 New
 York
 office
 I
 like
 to


sit
 on
 a
 a
 a
 bar
 top
 just
 out
 out
 side


of
 our
 coffee
 bar
 and
 I
 get
 it's
 like


doctor's
 hours
 uh
 it's
 demystified


speaking
 to
 the
 CEO
 coffee
 bar
 has
 a


cool
 name
 uh
 it
 does
 the
 contrarian
 Cafe


when
 you
 go
 to
 bed
 uh
 might
 be
 a
 little


boring
 there
 Nicolai
 I'm
 usually
 in
 bed


by
 10:
 like
 me
 energy
 what
 do
 you
 get


your
 energy
 from
 you
 know
 the
 answer
 is


I
 don't
 know
 I
 don't
 know
 really
 do
 you


think
 energy
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 genetic


or
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 genetic
 or


otherwise
 because
 there's
 there's
 just


no
 basis
 on
 which
 to
 know
 um
 but
 I
 will


say
 that
 I
 wake
 up
 I
 think
 I'm
 one
 of


the
 luckiest
 people
 in
 the
 world
 every


single
 day
 and
 there's
 no
 shortage
 of


things
 that
 interest
 me
 not
 just
 at


Apollo
 but
 elsewhere
 there's
 so
 much


going
 on
 in
 the
 world
 and
 each
 of
 us
 has


a
 role
 to
 play
 now
 my
 day
 job
 is
 is
 at


Apollo
 but
 as
 you
 know
 I've
 been
 very


active
 in
 what's
 happening
 on
 American


campuses
 in
 our


universities
 and
 I
 probably
 should
 just


flag
 here
 that
 we've
 been
 sitting
 at
 the


warden
 board
 together
 which
 is
 where
 I


got
 to
 know


you
 um
 but
 you
 also
 do
 restaurants
 you


have
 a
 a
 lobster
 you
 know
 restaurant


well
 restaurants
 are
 easy
 because
 it's


it's
 actually
 I
 don't
 know
 anything


about
 running
 a
 restaurant
 but
 I
 have
 an


amazing
 partner
 but
 if
 you
 look
 at
 we


now
 talk
 about
 Hobbies
 which
 is
 not
 only


are
 we
 interested
 in
 philanthropy
 we're


interested
 but
 we
 also
 need
 time
 for


ourselves
 one
 of
 my
 hobbies
 is
 building


things
 I
 collect
 nothing
 no
 art
 no
 cars


no
 wine
 no
 nothing
 but
 I
 like
 to
 build


things
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 did
 was
 I


renovated
 a
 historic
 building
 out
 in
 the


Hamptons
 on
 the
 Main
 Street
 in
 Sag


Harbor
 and
 I
 had
 as
 a
 tenant
 a


restaurant
 well
 that
 restaurant
 went
 out


of
 business
 and
 my
 space
 was
 dark
 for


six
 months
 I
 then
 had
 a
 second
 tenant


another
 restaurant
 who
 also
 went
 out
 of


business
 took
 me
 a
 year
 to
 realize
 I
 was


in
 the
 restaurant
 business
 I
 just
 didn't


know
 it
 so
 I
 formed
 a
 management
 company


I
 hired
 a
 terrific
 partner
 who
 actually


know
 something
 about
 running
 a


restaurant
 and
 I
 get
 to
 do
 the
 fun
 part


I
 get
 to
 do
 design
 construction
 menu


selection
 and
 concept
 but
 once
 it
 opens


I'm
 a
 customer
 a
 very
 happy
 customer
 but


a
 customer
 yeah
 when
 you
 make
 decisions


are
 they
 um
 analytically
 based
 or
 are


they
 gutfield
 based
 they're
 both
 um
 I'm


an
 analytical
 person
 but
 not
 everything


can
 be
 analyzed
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 we're


making
 judgments
 on
 on
 people
 and


judgments
 on
 the
 source
 of
 information


that
 we're
 getting
 as
 you
 know
 we
 live


in
 a
 world
 of


uncertainty
 and
 so
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 each


m
 how
 do
 you
 cope
 with
 stress
 I
 don't


find
 the
 job
 tremendously
 stressful
 I


know
 people
 find
 that
 weird
 but
 I
 just


don't
 I
 don't
 feel
 the
 stress
 from
 this


job
 I
 literally
 believe
 we
 are
 the


luckiest
 people
 in
 the
 world
 to
 be
 able


to
 do
 this
 this
 the
 slogan
 we
 have
 here


is
 we
 get
 to
 do
 this
 anytime
 someone


tells
 me
 in
 The
 Firm
 they
 don't
 like


what
 they're
 doing
 it's
 time
 for
 them
 to


have
 another
 job
 within
 the
 Apollo


system
 or
 to
 find
 something
 else
 to
 do


if
 you
 come
 in
 pretty
 often
 and
 you


don't
 think
 I
 get
 to
 do
 this
 this
 is
 not


the
 right
 job
 for
 you
 I
 get
 to
 do
 this


so
 when
 you
 interview
 people
 for
 this


firm
 what
 do
 you
 ask
 them
 what
 is
 key


for
 you
 when
 you
 hire
 people
 look
 you


you
 want
 you
 want
 some
 insight
 into
 who


they
 are
 and
 how
 they
 think
 and
 what


drives
 them
 so
 whatever
 questions
 help


you
 get
 at
 that
 along
 with
 the
 basics
 of


are
 they
 skilled
 to
 do
 their
 job
 if
 they


get
 to
 me
 generally
 my
 team
 has
 already


realized
 that
 they're
 qualified
 to
 do


the
 job
 the
 question
 is
 are
 they
 going


to
 fit
 we
 are
 a
 harder
 place
 to


integrate
 into
 but
 I
 believe
 a
 better


place
 to
 be
 as
 a
 career
 what
 do
 you
 mean


hard
 to
 integrate
 into
 so
 I'd
 say
 the


following
 we
 run
 a
 fully
 integrated


platform
 that
 means
 you
 are
 the


beneficiary
 of
 lots
 of
 other
 information


lots
 of
 other
 resources
 that
 are
 not


generally
 associated
 with
 your
 specific


Department
 if
 we
 were
 the
 kind
 of
 firm


where
 we
 were
 a
 series
 of
 silos
 you


could
 join
 our
 firm
 and
 get
 to
 know
 your


Silo
 really
 well
 and
 be
 very
 successful


here
 because
 we
 are
 an
 integrated


platform
 you
 don't
 just
 have
 to
 get
 to


know
 your
 Silo
 you
 have
 to
 get
 to
 know


who
 does
 what
 across
 the
 firm
 that
 makes


it
 harder
 to
 integrate
 but
 once
 you


master
 that
 the
 leverage
 you
 get
 in
 your


job
 is
 unbelievable
 and
 so
 is
 that
 for


everyone
 no
 it's
 not
 for
 everyone
 there


are
 some
 people
 who
 just
 want
 to
 be
 left


alone
 to
 do
 what
 they
 do
 and
 they
 do
 it


really
 well
 they
 could
 be
 really


successful
 but
 probably
 not
 really


successful


here
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 people
 who
 are


curious
 who
 understand
 the
 mutual


dependency
 of
 looking
 across
 the


platform
 understanding
 how
 everything


relates
 to
 everything
 else
 I
 think
 are


ideally
 suited
 for
 here
 how
 do
 you


Mentor
 your
 leaders
 this
 is
 it's
 an


interesting
 thing
 so
 I'm
 I'm
 going
 to


I'll
 tell
 you
 what
 we're
 working
 on
 and


it'll
 give
 you
 some
 notion
 into
 into


mentorship
 you
 take
 a
 firm
 like
 ours
 or


anyone
 in
 our
 industry
 we've
 been
 more


successful
 than
 any
 of
 us
 ever
 thought


we
 would


be
 most
 companies
 who
 are
 successful


eventually
 revert
 to
 the


mean
 people
 inside
 the
 firm
 leaders


start
 playing
 not
 to
 lose
 rather
 than


playing
 to
 win
 if
 you
 want
 to
 innovate


you
 have
 to
 get
 the
 team
 to
 play
 to
 win


how
 do
 you
 do
 that
 well
 in
 part
 you
 have


to
 make
 it
 safe
 for
 them
 to
 make
 a


decision
 and
 to
 fail
 y
 so
 how
 do
 we
 do


that
 I
 am
 try
 to
 emulate
 it
 for
 them


which
 is
 I
 let
 them
 know
 that
 I'm
 if
 I'm


right
 2third
 of
 the
 time
 that's
 a
 lot


and
 I
 fail
 a
 lot
 at
 least
 a
 third
 of
 the


time
 but
 I
 fail
 quickly
 I
 acknowledge
 it


I
 fix
 it
 and
 I
 move
 on
 to
 the
 next


that's
 that's
 different
 I'm
 not
 saying


we
 do
 that
 with
 money
 or
 with


Investments
 but
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 we
 run


the
 business
 and
 who
 we
 hire
 how
 we


position
 the
 business
 we
 are
 not
 going


to
 be
 right
 every
 time
 we
 make
 a


decision
 creating
 a
 place
 where
 people


are
 not
 afraid
 to
 make
 a
 decision
 and


are
 not
 afraid
 to
 fail
 and
 can
 openly


say
 I
 screwed
 that
 up
 let's
 fix
 it
 and


move
 on
 quickly
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 what
 it


takes
 I
 believe
 to
 be
 able


to
 play
 to
 win
 and
 not
 just
 play
 not
 to


lose
 when
 did
 you
 lose
 last
 we
 lose
 all


the
 time
 specifically
 look
 we
 uh
 I
 we


have
 lots
 of
 people
 who
 have
 come
 and


gone
 from
 Apollo
 where
 we
 made
 bad


decisions
 where
 we
 made
 bad
 decisions
 on


growth
 or
 something
 else
 if
 you
 were
 to


try
 to


abstract
 the
 type
 of
 mistakes
 you
 you've


made
 is
 do
 they
 have
 anything
 in
 common


their
 their
 people
 mistakes
 their


difficulty
 of
 scaling
 mistakes


or
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 they're
 time
 frame


mistakes
 and
 successes
 what
 do
 they
 have


in
 common
 for
 you
 success
 is
 usually


we've
 positioned
 ourselves
 the
 right


way
 and
 the
 market
 came
 at
 the
 right


time
 or
 we
 got
 there
 first
 we
 believ


something
 that
 no
 one
 else
 believed
 and


we
 just
 went
 went
 about
 and


executed
 by
 for
 us
 the
 biggest
 thing


that
 we've
 done
 has
 been
 Retirement


Services
 yeah
 we
 literally
 started
 with


$1
 million
 to
 a
 business
 that
 is
 now
 400


billion
 of
 assets
 under
 management
 where


we
 have
 a
 100
 firms
 who
 would
 like
 to


emulate
 what
 we've
 done
 and
 you
 managed


to
 acquire
 big
 portfolios
 when
 other


people
 sold
 them
 right
 it's
 not
 only
 the


answer
 is
 yes
 but
 we
 haven't
 acquired
 a


portfolio
 for
 years
 at
 this
 point
 we
 now


do
 70
 billion
 of
 organic
 business
 which


is
 by
 far
 the
 largest
 amount
 of
 business


versus
 established
 names
 in
 the


marketplace
 it's
 incredible
 um
 what
 do


you
 read
 I
 read
 mostly
 history
 um
 I
 like


to
 read
 a
 lot
 about
 the
 Middle
 East
 I


find
 it
 a
 just
 a
 fascinating
 place
 not


only
 because
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 today


but
 just
 because
 of
 how
 much
 change
 is


taking
 place
 I'm
 just
 back
 from
 the


Middle
 East
 last
 week
 and
 I
 come
 back


incredibly
 hopeful
 you
 have
 most
 of
 the


countries
 in
 the
 region
 who
 we
 thought


of
 two
 decades
 ago
 as
 Meed
 in


extremism
 focused
 on
 bettering
 the


future
 for
 their
 people
 on
 Commerce
 on


moving
 their
 their
 society
 s
 forward


very
 little
 in
 the
 way
 of
 extremism
 I


come
 away
 from
 a
 trip
 to
 the
 Middle
 East


incredibly
 hopeful
 now
 um
 we
 have
 tens


of
 thousands
 of
 young
 people
 listening


to
 this
 what
 advice
 would
 you
 give
 them


what
 advice
 would
 you
 have
 given
 to
 you


know
 Mark
 Rowan
 in
 a


1984
 look
 uh
 so
 I
 I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time


talking
 to
 young
 people
 it's
 it's
 part


of
 the
 fun
 the
 fun
 part
 of
 this
 job
 and


I
 tell
 them
 all
 the
 same
 thing
 master


your
 craft
 like
 ultimately
 you
 get
 to
 do


more
 when
 you
 become
 a
 master
 of
 your


craft
 once
 you
 do
 that
 then
 you
 can
 pick


your
 head
 up
 and
 you
 can
 look
 around
 and


start
 to
 connect
 the
 dots
 the
 second
 is


be
 honest
 with
 yourself
 all
 of
 these


jobs
 are
 really
 hard
 we
 should
 make
 we


should
 not
 be
 shy
 about
 this
 these
 are


all
 really
 hard
 if
 you
 don't


fundamentally
 love
 it
 you
 will
 not
 be


successful
 long
 term
 in
 this
 business


well
 Mark
 you
 have
 for
 sure
 mastered


your
 craft
 you
 have
 positioned
 this
 firm


uh
 to
 really
 benefit
 from
 from
 you
 know


all
 the
 all
 the
 wins
 and
 uh


congratulations
 it's
 been
 amazing
 thank


you
 it's
 been
 a
 tremendous
 amount
 of
 fun


and
 I'm
 fortunate
 to
 have
 200
 people
 who


make
 me
 look
 good
 all
 right
 good
 thank


you
 all
 right
 thank
 you
