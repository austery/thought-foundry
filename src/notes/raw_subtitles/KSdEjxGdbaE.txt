[Music]


hi
 everyone
 and
 welcome
 to
 in
 good


company
 and
 today
 we
 are
 thrilled
 to


have
 a
 bonus
 episode
 with
 Salan
 the


Visionary
 founder
 of
 Khan
 Academy
 now
 we


are
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 have
 to
 thank
 KH


for
 all
 his
 help
 with
 our
 homework
 and


learning
 including
 uh
 on
 behalf
 of
 my


own
 children
 so
 it's
 a
 pleasure
 to
 have


you
 here
 you
 have
 really
 revolutionized


education
 thanks
 for
 having
 me
 and
 and


also
 Sally
 it's
 kind
 of
 fun
 to
 have
 uh


somebody
 else
 on
 the
 bcast
 who
 has
 a
 a


background
 in
 in
 a
 hedge
 fund
 because
 uh


you're
 the
 first
 one
 actually
 oh
 yeah


okay
 we're
 hedge
 fund


refugees
 absolutely
 I
 just
 think
 it's


such
 a
 lovely
 story
 the
 way
 you
 went


from
 you
 know
 a
 hedge
 fund
 to
 starting


Can
 Academy
 would
 you
 mind
 just


recapping
 in
 a
 in
 a
 few
 words
 how
 you


got
 started
 on
 this
 yeah
 you
 you
 go
 back


to
 2004
 I
 was
 a
 year
 out
 of
 business


school
 my
 original
 background
 was
 in


tech
 but
 I
 go
 to
 business
 school
 I
 end


up
 at
 a
 very
 small
 hedge
 fund
 in
 Boston


a
 year
 out
 of
 business
 school
 I
 I'm
 get


I
 Get
 Married
 in
 New
 Jersey
 I
 was
 born


and
 raised
 in
 New
 Orleans
 my
 family


comes
 for
 my
 wedding
 in
 New
 Jersey
 and


then
 comes
 and
 spends
 time
 with
 me
 in


Boston
 and
 just
 comes
 out
 of


conversation
 that
 my
 12-year-old
 cousin


Nadia
 who
 was
 staying
 with
 us
 uh
 was


having
 trouble
 in
 math
 so
 I
 offered
 to


tutor
 her
 when
 she
 went
 back
 to
 New


Orleans
 she
 agreed
 and
 the
 tutoring


worked
 to
 a
 long
 story
 short
 and
 uh
 that


same
 naadia
 who
 was
 struggling
 with
 unit


conversion
 in
 seventh
 grade
 uh
 by
 that


summer
 was
 taking
 calculus
 classes
 at


the
 University
 of
 New
 Orleans
 uh
 so
 I


started
 tutoring
 her
 younger
 brothers


word
 spreads
 in
 my
 family-
 free
 tutoring


is
 going
 on
 before
 I
 know
 it
 I'm


tutoring
 10
 15
 cousins
 family
 friends
 uh


after
 work
 every
 day
 obviously
 this
 was


just
 a
 hobby
 and
 I
 saw
 a
 common
 pattern


that
 they
 were
 struggling
 because
 they


had
 gaps
 in
 their
 knowledge
 they
 needed


to
 review
 things
 they
 need
 to
 refresh


things
 so
 in
 2005
 I
 started
 writing


software
 for
 them
 once
 again
 it's
 a


family
 hobby
 but
 I
 called
 it
 KH
 Academy


and
 that
 software
 would
 give
 them


practice
 problems
 and
 for
 me
 as
 their


tutor
 to
 keep
 track
 of
 it
 it
 didn't
 have


videos
 at
 the
 time
 then
 in
 2006
 a
 friend


suggested
 Ed
 that
 I
 make
 YouTube
 videos


from
 my
 cousins
 to
 help
 scale
 my
 lessons


cuz
 I
 actually
 was
 having
 trouble


scheduling
 with
 10
 15
 cousins
 and
 I
 felt


like
 I
 was
 repeating
 the
 same
 thing
 over


and
 over
 again
 and
 so
 I
 started
 making


those
 videos
 and
 my
 cousins
 famously


told
 me
 that
 they
 like
 me
 better
 on


YouTube
 than
 in
 person
 and
 what
 they


were
 saying
 I
 think
 is
 uh
 they
 liked


having
 an
 ond
 demand
 version
 there
 was


no
 shame
 if
 they
 had
 to
 review
 something


from
 a
 few
 years
 earlier
 they
 could


watch
 it
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 night
 if


that's
 when
 they
 were
 working
 on
 the


problems
 they
 still
 appreciated
 having


me
 check
 in
 on
 them
 Etc
 and
 by
 2008
 2009


there
 were
 about
 50
 to
 100,000
 folks


using
 the
 videos
 and
 the
 software
 I


actually
 had
 to
 turn
 off
 the
 access
 to


the
 software
 because
 it
 was
 overwhelming


my
 web
 hosting
 uh
 and
 that's
 when
 I
 in


2008
 I
 set
 it
 up
 as
 a
 nonprofit
 at
 the


time
 I
 didn't
 think
 I
 was
 going
 to
 quit


my
 hedge
 fund
 job
 I
 actually
 liked
 my


hedge
 fund
 job
 uh
 but
 I
 set
 it
 up
 as
 a


nonprofit
 with
 a
 mission
 free
 worldclass


education
 for
 anyone
 anywhere
 and
 then


by
 2009
 I
 had
 trouble
 focusing
 on
 my


hedge
 fund
 job
 because
 it
 was
 I
 was


getting
 letters
 from
 all
 over
 the
 world


I
 was
 just
 waiting
 to
 get
 home
 to
 work


on
 the
 next
 video
 or
 to
 write
 the
 next


software
 module
 and
 so
 that's
 when
 I


quit
 my
 day
 job
 my
 wife
 and
 I
 looked
 at


our
 finances
 and
 we
 said
 okay
 maybe
 I


could
 do
 this
 for
 a
 year
 live
 off
 of


savings
 a
 bit
 um
 and
 that
 first
 year
 was


tough
 whenever
 you
 try
 to
 start
 anything


it's
 you
 you
 have
 a
 maybe
 delusionally


optimistic
 view
 of
 maybe
 people
 will


come
 and
 support
 it
 but
 it
 took
 a
 little


while
 but
 by
 uh
 fall
 of
 2010
 we
 got
 our


first
 significant
 uh
 philanthropic


support
 amazing
 and
 fast
 forward
 to
 now


how
 many
 people
 do
 you
 do
 you
 help
 oh


well
 you
 know
 it
 depends
 how
 you
 account


for
 it
 uh
 I
 think
 our
 registered
 users


is
 160
 or
 170
 million
 registered
 users


now
 I
 think
 if
 you
 counted
 it
 by
 You


Know
 lesson
 views
 it's
 in
 the
 billions


uh
 if
 you
 count
 it
 by
 learning
 minutes


per
 year
 that's
 also
 in
 the
 on
 I
 think


it's
 on
 the
 order
 of
 10
 10
 billion
 but


in
 the
 beginning
 um
 when
 you
 when
 it
 was


um
 slower
 what
 kept
 you
 motivating


motivated
 because
 I
 think
 it's


interesting
 you
 know
 successful


companies
 such
 as
 Nvidia
 uh
 you
 know


nearly
 went
 under
 a
 few
 times
 spottify


and
 nearly
 went
 under
 a
 few
 times
 what


kept
 you
 motivated
 through
 all
 this
 just


me
 being
 able
 to
 connect
 with
 my
 family


and
 them
 being
 able
 to
 accelerate
 in


math
 or
 make
 sure
 that
 they
 have


confidence
 in
 science
 or
 whatever


they're
 doing
 that
 was
 worth
 it
 for
 me


very
 much
 worth
 it
 and
 um
 but
 once
 it


started
 to
 getting
 out
 there
 and
 people


who
 are
 not
 my
 cous
 cousin
 started
 using


it
 and
 they
 started
 sending
 me
 notes


that
 note
 was
 like
 my
 pickme
 up
 of
 the


morning
 it
 still
 is
 we
 still
 get
 letters


at
 Khan
 Academy
 and
 the
 thing
 that
 you


know
 every
 I
 love
 my
 job
 but
 there's


good
 days
 bad
 days
 and
 but
 whenever
 I


read
 those
 letters
 from
 people
 all
 over


the
 world
 saying
 how
 you
 know
 some
 of


them
 are
 just
 simple
 thank
 yous
 like
 hey


you
 helped
 me
 pass
 this
 exam
 or
 that


exam
 but
 some
 of
 them
 are
 pretty


emotional
 where
 they're
 talking
 about


how
 they
 had
 no
 self-esteem
 in
 some


topic
 they
 you
 know
 people
 thought
 they


were
 were
 dumb
 their
 whole
 life
 then


they
 went
 some
 other
 career
 track
 or


they
 joined
 this
 or
 that
 and
 then
 they


found
 KH
 Academy
 and
 then
 they
 started


working
 at
 their
 own
 time
 in
 Pace
 they


discovered
 a
 a
 love
 for
 the
 subject
 and


then
 they
 go
 back
 to
 college
 or
 now


they're
 getting
 a
 PhD
 in
 something
 um


when
 you
 get
 letters
 like
 that
 from


people
 you
 don't
 know
 all
 over
 the
 world


it's
 incredibly
 motivating
 and
 so
 that


you
 know
 the
 hardest
 point
 was
 probably


that
 year
 from
 Fall
 of
 2009
 to
 fall
 of


2010
 where
 I
 had
 quit
 my
 day
 job
 we're


digging
 into
 our
 savings
 my
 wife
 was


still
 in
 training
 to
 be
 a
 doctor
 um
 our


first
 child
 had
 been
 born
 you
 could


imagine
 I
 had
 given
 up
 a
 very
 good
 job


that
 was
 paying
 very
 well
 um
 that
 was


you
 know
 three
 or
 four
 months
 into
 that


it
 was
 very
 stressful
 and
 whenever
 I
 was


tempted
 to
 you
 know
 re
 refresh
 my
 resume


and
 apply
 for
 another
 Finance
 job
 I


would
 look
 at
 these
 letters
 I
 was
 like


no
 this
 it's
 something
 here
 and
 I
 I
 did


tell
 myself
 if
 if
 I
 didn't
 get
 any
 real


philanthropic
 funding
 in
 the
 next
 year
 I


wouldn't
 give
 up
 the
 project
 I
 would
 go


back
 to
 work
 so
 I
 could
 support
 myself


and
 my
 family
 but
 I
 would
 keep
 working


on
 it
 as
 a
 hobby
 um
 and
 maybe
 the
 the


timing
 just
 wasn't
 right
 so
 I
 I
 did
 want


to
 make
 it
 unkillable
 because
 I
 I
 I
 I


felt
 in
 my
 heart
 of
 hearts
 that
 there


was
 there
 was
 something
 there
 what
 when


through
 your
 head
 when
 you
 were
 thinking


okay
 I'm
 either
 going
 to
 work
 in
 a
 hedge


fund
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 or
 I'm
 going
 to


start
 this
 philanthropic
 Venture
 and
 you


know
 really
 help
 the
 world
 what
 what


went
 through
 your


head
 you
 know
 it's
 interesting
 when
 I
 um


came
 out
 of
 B
 you
 know
 as
 as
 I
 mentioned


I
 business
 school
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 of


like
 what
 am
 I
 going
 to
 do
 with
 my


lifetime
 and
 while
 there
 uh
 I
 I
 had


never
 no
 I
 had
 no
 experience
 in
 finance


before
 that
 um
 and
 once
 I
 was
 there
 I
 I


took
 a
 class
 in
 Capital
 markets
 which


was
 pretty
 math
 heavy
 uh
 but
 I
 was


fascinated
 because
 it
 had
 a
 math
 aspect


to
 it
 but
 it
 also
 had
 a
 very


historical
 uh
 human
 psychological


aspects
 to
 it
 you
 really
 have
 to


understand
 how
 the
 world
 works
 and
 I


remember
 asking
 the
 professor
 there
 hey


I
 love
 this
 class
 what
 should
 I
 do
 and


he's
 like
 oh
 you
 should
 work
 at
 a
 hedge


fund
 and
 I
 said
 well
 that
 sounds
 great


what's
 a
 hedge
 fund
 and
 you
 know
 we


explain
 it's
 it's
 like
 a
 it's
 an


investment
 firm
 but
 they
 have
 more


flexibility
 and
 they
 can
 do
 more


creative
 things
 than
 say
 a
 mutual
 fund


um
 and
 so
 I
 I
 was
 drawn
 to
 that
 career


because
 of
 the
 intellectual
 Journey
 that


it
 seemed
 to
 have
 and
 I
 was
 so
 naive
 I


started
 asking
 some
 friends
 in
 finance
 I


said
 hey
 do
 hedge
 funds
 pay
 well
 and


they
 said
 yeah
 I
 said
 about
 how
 much
 and


um
 once
 I
 learned
 that
 and
 I
 had
 I
 still


had
 some
 debt
 from
 undergrad
 and
 then
 I


had
 about
 $120,000
 of
 debt
 from
 business


school
 I
 said
 you
 know
 I
 did
 not
 grow
 up


I
 I
 think
 you
 know
 my
 family
 I
 grew
 up


in
 a
 single
 mother
 household
 at
 best
 I


would
 call
 us
 a
 lower
 middle
 class
 at


best
 I
 was
 like
 okay
 I
 need
 to
 pay
 off


this
 debt
 save
 some
 money
 and
 you
 know


get
 a
 down
 payment
 on
 a
 house
 eventually


help
 maybe
 help
 support
 family
 Etc
 and


it
 was
 intellectually
 stimulating
 so


that's
 what
 drove
 me
 down
 the
 hedge
 fund


path
 but
 my
 my
 wife
 at
 that
 time
 my


fiance
 always
 used
 to
 give
 me
 a
 little


bit
 of
 grief
 about
 it
 she's
 like
 you


know
 people
 like
 you
 you're
 you
 you
 have


this
 education
 you
 have
 all
 of
 these


skills
 and
 you're
 just
 using
 it
 to
 make


in
 to
 make
 investments
 I
 was
 like
 well


you
 know
 the
 head
 world
 needs
 hedge


funds
 it
 helps
 price
 Discovery
 and


liquidity
 and
 all
 this
 kind
 well
 I'll


tell
 you
 I'll
 tell
 you
 s
 I've
 heard
 I've


heard
 exactly
 the
 same
 thing
 um
 but
 I'm


I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 really
 glad
 you
 saw
 the


light
 now
 when
 did
 you
 realize
 that
 this


was
 really
 going
 to
 be
 big
 we
 all


remember
 or
 many
 of
 us
 remember
 what
 was


happening
 in
 um
 2008
 and
 2009
 uh
 you


have
 the
 financial
 crisis
 and
 I
 was


already
 making
 videos
 from
 my
 cousins
 on


algebra
 and
 physics
 and
 SAT
 prep
 and


then
 I
 saw
 that
 people
 were
 not
 did
 not


understand
 the
 difference
 between
 um


insolvency
 and
 illiquidity
 they
 did
 not


understand
 what
 a
 credit
 default
 swap
 is


or
 what
 a
 mortgage
 back
 sec
 security
 and


these
 things
 that
 historically
 were
 kind


of
 exotic
 things
 that
 people
 in
 High


Finance
 would
 know
 we
 now
 on
 the


headlines
 on
 on
 in
 the
 newspaper
 or
 on


the
 news
 and
 so
 I
 started
 making
 videos


on
 how
 does
 a
 Federal
 Reserve
 work
 what


does
 a
 financial
 contagion
 look
 like
 um


what's
 a
 mortgage
 back
 security
 credit


default
 swap
 etc
 etc
 and
 um
 it
 turns
 out


that
 the
 mainstream
 press
 I
 started


getting
 letters
 from
 the
 the
 mainstream


Outlet
 saying
 hey
 we're
 watching
 your


videos
 before
 we're
 reporting
 on
 the


financial
 crisis
 and
 then
 they
 the
 first


National
 publicity
 or
 International


publicity
 that
 Khan
 Academy
 got
 had


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 academic
 subjects
 it


was
 CNN
 brought
 me
 on
 to
 talk
 about
 the


financial
 crisis
 for
 15
 minutes
 straight


on
 the
 day
 that
 I
 think
 you
 know
 the


market
 tanked
 by
 like
 4%
 that
 day
 or
 5%


uh
 but
 that
 was
 a
 signal
 that
 to
 me
 that


look
 though
 even
 though
 what
 I
 was
 you


know
 now
 it's
 become
 mainstream
 for


people
 to
 do
 something
 on
 YouTube
 and
 to


get
 a
 lot
 of
 attention
 and
 even
 make
 a


living
 in
 2008
 2009
 that
 was
 not
 a


mainstream
 thing
 as
 especially
 because
 I


wasn't
 doing
 dance
 videos
 I
 was
 doing


fairly
 you
 know
 I
 was
 explaining
 credit


default
 swaps
 um
 but
 that
 you
 know
 when


you
 get
 that
 type
 of
 attention
 for
 it
 I


was
 like
 okay
 there's
 something
 here
 and


then
 that
 helped
 bring
 even
 more


attention
 and
 Word
 of
 Mouth
 to
 what
 was


happening
 on
 the
 math
 and
 the
 science


and
 and
 all
 the
 other
 subjects
 we
 were


doing
 but
 there's
 something
 with
 this


tutoring
 this
 uh
 kind
 of
 detail
 help


that
 you
 talk
 about
 as
 the
 two
 Sigma


well
 two
 Sigma
 problem
 but
 also
 to
 Sigma


opportunity
 what
 what
 exactly
 do
 you


mean
 by
 that


yeah
 well
 I
 think
 people
 have
 always


intuitively
 thought
 that
 hey
 the
 best


education
 is
 going
 to
 come
 if
 you
 have
 a


lot
 of
 attention
 if
 you
 have
 a


one-on-one
 tutor
 or
 if
 you
 even
 have
 an


army
 of
 tutors
 you
 if
 we
 think
 about


throughout
 history
 what
 what
 princes
 and


and
 kings
 and
 and
 future
 Emperors
 got
 as


their
 education
 they
 did
 not
 sit
 in
 a


class
 of
 30
 students
 and
 someone
 did
 not


just
 lecture
 to
 them
 and
 every
 now
 and


then
 they
 took
 a
 test
 and
 if
 they
 happen


to
 fail
 the
 test
 the
 class
 just
 moves
 on


to
 the
 next
 subject
 young
 Alexander
 the


Great
 he
 wasn't
 Alexander
 the
 Great
 at


that
 time
 um
 and
 I
 guess
 it's
 debatable


whether
 he
 was
 great
 at
 this
 point
 but


you
 know
 young
 Alexander
 back
 uh
 what


300
 something
 BC
 um
 he
 his
 tutor
 was


Aristotle
 uh
 and
 I
 am
 guessing
 that
 if


you
 know
 Aristotle
 said
 okay
 this
 this


kid's
 going
 to
 be
 Emperor
 one


day
 if
 if
 he's
 struggling
 with
 military


strategy
 I'm
 not
 just
 going
 to
 give
 him


a
 c
 and
 move
 on
 I'm
 gonna
 work
 with
 him


and
 make
 sure
 he
 understands
 military


strategy
 if
 he's
 struggling
 with
 the


accounting
 for
 the
 for
 the
 for
 the


nation
 or
 for
 the
 Empire
 uh
 he
 needs
 to


understand
 that
 in
 order
 for
 him
 to


govern
 uh
 for
 his
 future
 so
 young


Alexander
 was
 getting
 personalized


tutoring
 personalized
 teaching
 from


Aristotle
 you
 fast
 forward
 to
 about
 it's


called
 300
 years
 ago
 a
 very
 utopian
 idea


of
 Mass
 public
 education
 it
 started
 in


some
 of
 these
 first
 countries
 to


industrialize
 uh
 you
 know
 what
 is
 now


Germany
 the
 UK
 the
 United
 States
 Japan


were
 the
 first
 countries
 to
 say
 hey
 we


should
 have
 Mass
 public
 education
 but


they
 had
 to
 make
 a
 compromise
 they
 said


well
 we
 can't
 afford
 to
 give
 everyone
 an


Aristotle
 we're
 going
 to
 U
 use
 the
 tools


of
 the
 Industrial
 Revolution
 we're
 going


to
 batch
 students
 together
 move
 them
 at


a
 set
 Pace
 we're
 going
 to
 create
 some


standards
 we're
 going
 to
 create


assessments
 that
 measure
 and
 you
 know
 we


don't
 need
 everyone
 to
 be
 to
 master


quantum
 physics
 or
 calculus
 they
 didn't


know
 about
 quantum
 physics
 back
 then
 we


don't
 need
 everyone
 to
 be
 able
 to
 become


a
 a
 professor
 so
 we'll
 just
 sort
 people


you
 know
 we'll
 just
 measure
 the
 product


and
 at
 certain
 decision
 points
 certain


product
 is
 really
 retaining
 the


knowledge
 and
 those
 are
 the
 people
 who


are
 going
 to
 go
 into
 the
 knowledge


economy
 and
 then
 certain
 people
 are
 in


the
 middle
 well
 you
 know
 those
 could


people
 can
 kind
 of
 be
 the
 managers
 of


the
 factories
 and
 then
 there's
 certain


people
 who
 are
 struggling
 and
 those


could
 be
 the
 less
 skilled
 uh
 labor
 that


we
 need
 for
 for
 the
 Industrial


Revolution
 and
 is
 that
 pretty
 much
 and


do
 you
 and
 do
 you
 feel
 that's
 pretty


much
 how
 Society
 still
 works
 yeah
 I
 mean


that's
 that's
 that's
 the
 system
 that


we've
 taken
 for
 granted
 that
 we
 just


assume
 is
 how
 the
 world
 works
 for
 the


last
 300
 years
 but
 we
 know
 today
 that


it's
 not
 okay
 for
 only
 five
 or
 10%
 of


folks
 to
 really
 be
 able
 to
 participate


in
 the
 knowledge
 economy
 that
 the


knowledge
 economy
 is
 booming
 and
 that


because
 of
 AI
 and
 Robotics
 everything


else
 actually
 might
 might
 really
 shrink


in
 the
 next
 let's
 call
 it
 10
 or
 20
 years


uh
 and
 the
 good
 news
 is
 is
 that
 we
 do


now
 have
 tools
 that
 we
 don't
 have
 to


make
 the
 same
 compromises
 that
 we
 had
 in


the
 Industrial
 Age
 and
 to
 you
 know
 you


allude
 to
 the
 two
 Sigma
 study
 Benjamin


Bloom
 this
 is
 back
 in
 1984
 he
 wrote
 this


paper
 it's
 it's
 probably
 the
 most
 cited


paper
 on
 tutoring
 and
 Mastery
 learning


and
 Mastery
 learning
 is
 just
 this
 idea


if
 you
 haven't
 learned
 it
 yet
 keep


working
 on
 it
 that's
 all
 Mastery


learning
 is
 don't
 don't
 move
 on
 or
 you


can
 move
 on
 but
 come
 back
 and
 and
 and


fill
 in
 that
 Gap
 and
 you
 know
 he
 argues


in
 that
 paper
 and
 he
 has
 some
 data
 to


back
 it
 up
 that
 you
 could
 get
 a
 two


standard
 deviation
 Improvement
 by
 having


one-on-one
 two
 ing
 in
 a
 Mastery


framework
 now
 since
 then
 people
 have


debated
 is
 it
 two
 standard
 deviations
 is


it
 less
 but
 generally
 speaking
 there's


there's
 a
 large
 evidence
 pool
 that
 more


personalization
 one-on-one
 is
 good
 for


is
 is
 good
 for
 students
 it
 has
 it
 has
 an


effect
 but
 he
 he
 framed
 that
 paper
 as
 a


problem
 because
 he's
 like
 well
 this
 is


nice
 but
 how
 are
 you
 going
 to
 scale
 that


well
 not
 what
 if
 you
 think
 about
 what
 KH


academ
 has
 been
 doing
 even
 before
 we


talk
 about
 things
 like
 generative


AI
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 scale
 myself
 as
 a


one-on-one
 tutor
 and
 the
 first
 thing
 I


did
 is
 I
 created
 some
 of
 those


personalized
 exercises
 then
 I
 created


dashboards
 for
 myself
 to
 monitor
 my
 my


students
 my
 cousins
 so
 that
 I
 could
 be


more
 personalized
 with
 them
 when
 I
 got


on
 the
 phone
 I
 started
 write
 making
 on


demand
 video
 it's
 not
 the
 same
 as
 a


one-on-one
 tutor
 but
 it
 has
 aspects
 of


it
 if
 my
 cousins
 were
 stuck
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 night
 they
 could
 get
 that


on
 demand
 help
 and
 I
 was
 making
 these


short
 5
 10
 minute
 videos
 so
 was
 almost


like
 and
 there's
 a
 library
 of
 hundreds


and
 now
 thousands
 of
 them
 that
 whatever


your
 question
 is
 you
 can
 click
 on
 that


video
 and
 now
 with
 AI
 we
 can
 potentially


go
 go
 go
 even
 further
 so
 that's
 always


been
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 the
 motivation
 in


hindsight
 that
 how
 do
 we
 scale
 what
 a


one-on-one
 tutor
 do
 what
 I
 was
 doing


with
 Nadia
 when
 we
 look
 at
 um
 some
 of


the
 progress
 that
 has
 happened
 why
 why


hasn't
 high
 quality
 education
 worked
 out


properly
 I
 mean
 there
 was
 a
 there
 was
 a


moment
 here
 where
 we
 had
 this
 Mongolian


Shepherd
 story
 a
 15-year-old
 aced
 the


MIT
 entrance
 exam
 and
 and
 he
 was
 just


like
 wow
 everybody
 from
 the
 whole
 world


can
 can
 really
 make
 it
 but
 we
 haven't


got
 so
 many
 Mongolians
 uh
 you
 know
 at


top
 universities
 as
 we
 had
 thought
 so


why
 has
 that
 not
 happened
 so
 I
 there's


two
 narratives
 here
 actually
 to
 some


degree
 it
 has
 happened
 um
 it's
 but
 the


numbers
 aren't
 so
 large
 that
 you're


seeing
 it
 move
 the
 entire
 distribution


one
 of
 the
 big
 changes
 and
 we
 get


letters
 to
 this
 effect
 almost
 on
 a
 daily


basis
 in
 fact
 another
 story
 from


Mongolia
 we
 had
 a
 a
 young
 uh
 orphan
 girl


you
 know
 she
 she
 wrote
 me
 a
 letter
 I


didn't
 know
 who
 she
 was
 I
 assume
 she's


middle
 class
 but
 then
 she
 says
 that
 some


volunteers
 set
 up
 computer
 lab
 in
 her


orphanage
 in
 Mongolia
 speaking
 of


Mongolia
 and
 she
 got
 hooked
 on
 KH


Academy
 and
 then
 that
 allowed
 her
 not


just
 only
 to
 to
 get
 her
 degree
 but
 it


she's
 she
 then
 became
 the
 top
 creator
 of


content
 in
 the
 Mongolian
 language
 for
 KH


Academy
 there
 another
 young
 woman
 in


Afghanistan
 Taliban
 keeps
 her
 from
 going


to
 school
 she
 actually


this
 her
 name
 is
 um
 her
 name
 is
 Sola
 she


just
 wrote
 a
 book
 about
 it
 but
 she
 when


she
 couldn't
 go
 to
 school
 an
 uncle


introduces
 her
 to
 Khan
 Academy
 she
 was


lucky
 enough
 to
 at
 least
 have
 an


internet
 connection
 she's
 middle
 class


family
 she
 uses
 that
 to
 self-educate


herself
 starting
 at
 age
 I
 think
 she
 was


about
 12
 years
 old
 by
 16
 or
 17
 this
 is


all
 she's
 doing
 you
 know
 for
 two
 hours
 a


day
 when
 she's
 not
 doing
 her
 chores
 and


she
 decides
 she
 wants
 to
 become
 a


Quantum
 uh
 a
 Quantum
 researcher
 uh
 in


the
 United
 States
 and
 so
 she
 she
 lies
 to


her
 parents
 to
 go
 to
 Pakistan
 to
 take


the
 SAT
 because
 it
 wasn't
 administered


in
 in
 in
 the
 US
 she
 does
 shockingly
 well


um
 she


for
 the
 most
 part
 educated
 only
 on
 Khan


Academy
 and
 that's
 when
 I
 found
 out


about
 her
 I
 I
 try
 to
 figure
 out
 what


colleges
 will
 take
 her
 without
 any


formal
 education
 Nicholas
 Kristoff
 of


the
 New
 York
 Times
 writes
 about
 her
 and


then
 she
 was
 able
 to
 get
 a
 Visa
 ASU


takes
 her
 she
 rocks
 the
 physics


department
 there
 now
 she's
 actually
 a


Quantum
 Computing
 researcher
 at
 tus


University
 so
 these
 stories
 are
 out


there
 and
 we
 get
 a
 letter
 kind
 of
 like


this
 on
 a
 weekly
 monthly
 basis
 I
 just
 we


just
 got
 one
 last
 week
 of
 a
 of
 a
 a
 a


young
 person
 in
 the
 UK
 they
 had
 a
 child


at
 a
 young
 age
 dropped
 out
 ended
 up


becoming
 a
 construction
 worker
 found


Khan
 Academy
 got
 hooked
 on
 it
 just


started
 talking
 to
 everyone
 they
 could


find
 about
 physics
 and
 chemistry
 and


their
 manager
 said
 hey
 if
 you
 don't
 go


to
 college
 I'm
 gonna
 fire
 you
 because


you're
 just
 boring
 all
 of
 us
 talking


about
 physics
 and
 chemistry
 all
 day
 and


this
 person
 is
 now
 um
 you
 know
 first
 of


all
 met
 their
 their
 their
 you
 know
 life


partner
 in
 college
 uh
 they
 graduated
 you


know
 with
 it
 sounds
 like
 straight
 A
 and


now
 they're
 entering
 a
 PhD
 program
 in


Biochemistry
 so
 so
 this
 is
 out
 there
 so


that's
 one
 story
 that
 for
 for
 those
 who


are
 reasonably
 motivated
 and
 I'm
 not


necessarily
 High
 achieving
 because
 this


last
 example
 was
 someone
 that
 the
 system


was
 telling
 was
 was
 not
 achieving
 but
 if


they're
 motivated
 and
 that
 motivation


might
 kick
 in
 at
 different
 stages
 of


life
 but
 if
 they're
 motivated
 and
 they


at
 least
 have
 access
 to
 a
 internet


connection
 a
 computer
 and
 awareness
 of


Khan
 Academy
 and
 other
 tools
 there's


mukes
 and
 other
 things
 we
 are
 seeing
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 mini
 revolution
 of
 these


people
 who
 would
 have
 otherwise
 been


lost
 now
 for
 better
 for
 worse
 that
 that


group
 of
 people
 that
 I
 just
 described
 is


a
 a
 small
 minority
 of
 the
 broader


population
 and
 so
 I
 think
 there's
 two


tasks
 one
 is
 how
 do
 we
 lower
 how
 do
 we


make
 it
 even
 easier
 and
 easier
 to
 do


what
 these
 people
 just
 did
 so
 that
 you


don't
 have
 to
 have
 quite
 their


determination
 to
 to
 be
 able
 to
 uh
 pull


it
 off
 and
 then
 I
 think
 the
 other
 elent


is
 there
 there
 are
 just
 a
 lot
 of
 um


Learners
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 they're


inherently
 demotivated
 but
 I
 think


something
 has
 happened
 to
 them
 over
 the


years
 where
 they
 have
 just
 given
 up
 and


I
 so
 I
 think
 there
 needs
 to
 be
 systems


to
 re-engage
 them
 and
 I
 think
 that's


primarily
 going
 to
 happen
 through
 the


traditional
 school
 system
 and
 so
 that's


where
 we're
 working
 to
 do
 that
 AI
 you


did
 a
 great
 Ted
 Talk
 on
 how
 AI
 is
 going


to
 change


education
 tell
 us
 about
 it
 yeah
 and
 my


dog
 wants
 to
 leave
 the
 room
 let
 me
 open


the


door
 sorry


um
 should
 we
 take
 it
 yeah
 no
 we'll
 have


your
 dog
 we'll
 have
 your
 dog
 in
 there


what
 kind
 is
 it
 it's
 a
 little
 golden


doodle
 but
 you
 she's
 our
 guard
 dog
 and
 I


think
 my
 wife
 just
 came
 into
 the
 door
 so


she
 ran
 over
 there
 but
 the


um
 you
 know
 a
 AI
 has
 always
 been
 of


interest
 to
 us
 at
 Khan
 Academy
 well


before
 this
 latest
 gen
 ative
 AI


Revolution
 obviously
 AI
 we've
 thought


about
 hey
 could
 be
 used
 to
 inform


recommended
 activities
 for
 students
 etc


etc
 so
 that's
 and
 and
 we
 have


experimented
 with
 that
 at
 KH
 Academy


over
 the
 years
 summer
 of
 2022
 open
 AI


Greg
 Brockman
 Sam
 mman
 they
 reach
 out
 to


me
 they
 say
 hey
 we're
 about
 to
 generate


we're
 about
 to
 train
 finish
 training
 our


our
 next
 Generation
 model
 which
 would


end
 up
 being
 gp4
 we
 think
 this
 is
 going


to
 be
 really
 interesting
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people
 but
 it
 also
 might
 be
 a
 little
 bit


jarring
 because
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 quite


powerful
 we
 want
 launch
 with
 and
 partner


with
 organizations
 that
 people
 trust


that
 can
 show
 socially
 positive
 use


cases
 of
 it
 and
 by
 their
 own
 words
 Khan


Academy
 was
 was
 the
 first
 organization


they
 thought
 of
 and
 first
 time
 you
 saw


it
 and
 saw
 what
 it
 could
 do
 what
 did
 you


think
 yeah
 I
 went
 into
 that
 meeting
 very


skeptical
 because
 I
 I
 had
 kept
 track
 of


gpt2
 gpt3
 I
 thought
 they
 were
 cool
 super


fascinating
 but
 they
 were
 like
 they
 were


good
 at
 writing
 things
 that
 sounded


thoughtful
 but
 when
 you
 really
 tried
 to


read
 it
 you're
 like
 this
 is
 this
 is


meaningless
 or
 or
 it's
 really
 not
 H
 it


doesn't
 really
 have
 a
 good
 handle
 on
 the


information
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 intelligent


but
 when
 that
 first
 when
 they
 when
 they


we
 you
 know
 they
 essentially
 shared


their
 screen
 with
 us
 and
 this
 was
 months


before
 chat
 GPT
 existed
 and
 chat
 GPT


when
 it
 launched
 was
 based
 on
 GPT
 3.5


here
 was
 GPT
 4
 and
 they
 showed
 me
 a


biology
 question
 and
 they
 said
 s
 what's


the
 answer
 here
 and
 I've
 read
 it
 I'm


like
 okay
 the
 answer
 is
 C
 osmosis
 and


they
 said
 okay
 then
 they
 then
 they
 asked


the
 AI
 the
 AI
 said
 c
 I'm
 like
 okay
 maybe


I
 got
 lucky


I
 I
 said
 ask
 it
 to
 explain
 why
 it


explained
 it
 very
 good
 explanation


perfect
 explanation
 I'm
 like
 okay
 uh


this
 is
 interesting
 I
 said
 explain
 why


the
 other
 choices
 aren't
 right
 very
 good


explanations
 then
 now
 I'm
 getting


Goosebumps
 then
 I
 said
 have
 it
 write


another
 question
 like
 this
 it
 did
 it
 I'm


like
 uhoh
 and
 then
 I
 said
 haven't
 write


10
 more
 questions
 like
 this
 it
 did
 it


now
 I'm
 like
 okay
 this
 is
 a
 this
 is
 like


the
 world
 I'm
 in
 a
 science
 fiction
 book


am
 I
 am
 I
 dreaming
 right
 now
 and
 they


said
 hey
 would
 you
 like
 access
 to
 it
 I'm


like
 yes
 please
 and
 so
 you
 know
 we


signed
 all
 the
 ndas
 and
 everything
 and


so
 we
 got
 myself
 our
 chief
 learning


officer
 or
 CTO
 got
 access
 to
 it
 that


weekend
 we
 couldn't
 sleep
 and
 you
 could


imagine
 it
 was
 I
 have
 trouble
 keeping


secrets
 I'm
 like
 an
 open
 book
 on
 like


everything
 and
 like
 I
 felt
 like
 the


three
 of
 us
 had
 like
 the
 biggest
 secret


on
 the
 planet
 that
 no
 one
 else
 knew


about
 but
 now
 you
 integrated
 in
 what
 you


called
 Canam
 kigo
 right
 which
 is
 like
 an


AI
 powered
 tutor
 what
 so
 what
 what
 can


this
 do
 as
 as
 we
 started
 experimenting


with
 it
 we
 started
 realizing
 that


especially
 these
 NE
 this
 next
 generation


of
 Frontier
 Model
 like
 gp4
 they're


capable
 of
 really
 taking
 on
 um
 uh


personas
 and
 roles
 in
 ways
 that
 no
 other


previous
 model
 could
 and
 it's
 not
 just


pretend
 they
 really
 could
 do
 the
 things


that
 a
 strong
 tutor
 would
 do
 a
 strong


teaching
 assistant
 a
 strong
 coach
 or


guidance
 counselor
 might
 do
 and
 so
 we


immediately
 saw
 the
 potential
 like
 hey


this
 could
 be
 that
 that
 that
 that
 tutor


for
 every
 child
 and
 actually
 a
 teaching


assist
 for
 every
 teacher
 helping
 them
 do


things
 like
 develop
 lesson
 plans
 or


understand
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 their


students
 but
 we
 also
 realize
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 fears
 here
 how
 do
 you
 have
 a


12-year-old
 useing
 Ai
 and
 what
 if
 they


have
 a
 weird
 conversation
 inappropriate


conversation
 an
 unsafe
 conversation
 what


if
 they
 use
 it
 to
 cheat
 what
 if
 um
 how


do
 we
 make
 sure
 there's
 data
 privacy


safeguards
 Etc
 so
 we
 were
 having
 these


debates
 and
 we
 decided
 look
 we
 can't
 shy


away
 from
 this
 let's
 build
 this
 but


let's
 turn
 all
 of
 those
 fears
 and
 risks


into
 features
 so
 let's
 make
 it
 so
 it's


transparent
 to
 teachers
 let's
 make
 it
 so


that
 another
 AI
 is
 monitoring
 if
 it


notices
 anything
 going
 funny
 it'll
 shut


down
 the
 conversation
 and
 actively


notify
 uh
 teachers
 you
 know
 we
 have
 all


sorts
 of
 other
 guard
 rails
 on
 it
 it


won't
 cheat
 it's
 more
 of
 a
 Socratic


tutor
 but
 it
 will
 nudge
 you
 forward
 with


with
 leading
 questions
 and
 so
 that's


what
 we
 launched
 with
 kigo
 we
 launched


alongside
 the
 gp4
 launch
 back
 in
 March


of


2023
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 we
 launched
 it


as
 a
 pilot
 and
 it's
 still
 in
 a
 lot
 of


ways
 is
 a
 pilot
 but
 the
 response
 has


been
 more
 positive
 and
 and
 people
 are


ramping
 into
 it
 much
 faster
 than
 I
 would


have
 expected
 I
 could
 I
 could
 speak
 for


an
 hour
 about
 all
 the
 features
 we're


hoping
 to
 add
 in
 the
 next
 in
 the
 next


year
 but
 but
 it's
 a
 lot's
 happening


there
 yeah
 I
 would
 recommend
 everybody


to
 listen
 to
 your
 Tad
 talk
 and
 uh
 on
 on


AI
 and
 education
 but
 um
 what
 uh
 but
 in


terms
 of
 the
 general
 educational
 system


how
 should
 they
 you
 go
 about
 applying
 AI


or


not
 well
 I
 they
 definitely
 can't
 ignore


it
 uh
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 key
 skill


going
 forward
 already
 in
 almost
 every


role
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I
 completely


understand
 where
 Educators
 you
 know
 why


they
 banned
 chat
 GPT
 because
 it's
 not


made
 for
 Education
 it
 it
 can
 be
 used
 to


cheat
 it
 is
 not
 it
 did
 not
 put
 as
 many


safeguards
 it's
 it's
 not
 even
 allowed


for
 under
 18
 users
 although
 I'm
 sure
 a


lot
 of
 under
 18
 folks
 have
 you
 know
 said


they're
 18
 and
 and
 and
 are
 using
 it
 and


so
 the
 important
 thing
 is
 to
 use
 these


tools
 in
 an
 environment
 that
 is
 one
 has


all
 the
 right
 guard
 rails
 for
 education


and
 you're
 not
 using
 a
 tool
 for
 the
 sake


of
 it
 if
 we
 want
 to
 save
 teachers
 time


on
 grading
 on
 lesson
 planning
 Etc
 they


should
 be
 using
 tool
 like
 like
 kigo
 so


um
 it's
 it's
 it's
 really
 about
 embracing


the
 underlying
 technology
 but
 using
 it


in
 a
 way
 that
 is
 thoughtful
 and


purpose-built
 for


Education
 if
 you
 got
 $1
 billion
 dollar


now
 how
 would
 you
 spend
 it
 to
 improve


education
 if
 I
 had
 a
 billion
 dollars


it's
 a
 fun
 question
 um
 I
 would
 I
 would


accelerate
 I
 would
 accelerate
 the
 you


know
 right
 now
 Khan
 Academy's
 budget
 is


around
 75
 it's
 probably
 going
 to
 be


about
 $80
 million
 next
 year
 uh
 and
 every


time
 I
 say
 that
 because
 I
 have
 to
 raise


a
 lot
 of
 that
 money
 philanthropically
 I


remind
 my
 I
 I
 tell
 donors
 hey
 that's


just
 the
 budget
 of
 a
 large
 High
 School


in
 the
 US
 and
 you
 know
 we're
 we're


educating
 a
 lot
 of
 folks
 and
 reaching
 a


lot
 of
 folks
 but
 I
 I
 would
 probably
 take


another
 30
 to
 40
 million
 a
 year
 and


further
 accelerate
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 content


and
 software
 and
 and
 product
 development


we're
 doing
 our
 goal
 has
 always
 been


even
 before
 AI
 to
 cover
 all
 of
 the
 core


academic
 subjects
 and
 grades
 we're
 close


already
 but
 I
 would
 go
 and
 that's
 from


prek
 through
 the
 core
 of
 college
 so
 I


would
 use
 some
 of
 that
 to
 accelerate


into
 even
 more
 uh
 subject
 areas
 we
 we


already
 have
 math
 we
 already
 have
 pretty


comprehensive
 I
 would
 go
 even
 further


into
 college
 science
 we're
 quite


comprehensive
 I'd
 go
 even
 further
 into


sophomore
 junior
 level
 College
 we're


starting
 to
 have
 a
 pretty
 robust


humanities
 and
 um
 English
 language
 arts


offering
 I
 would
 try
 to
 accelerate
 that


and
 then
 on
 the
 AI
 front
 um
 yeah
 I
 would


I
 would
 use
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 resources
 to


just
 accelerate
 it
 that
 much
 more
 but


you
 know
 with
 that
 type
 of
 resources
 I


would
 also
 probably
 create
 National
 or


International
 systems
 around


credentialing
 uh
 where
 you
 know
 the


tools
 exist
 now
 where
 you
 can
 learn
 a


lot
 on
 your
 own
 or
 with
 support
 and


those
 tools
 and
 then
 you
 can
 even
 prove


that
 you
 know
 it
 but
 the
 the
 the
 Legacy


systems
 don't
 fully
 recognize
 it
 yet
 yet


and
 so
 you
 know
 I've
 told
 people
 if
 I


was
 Secretary
 of
 Education
 or
 minister


of
 education
 for
 any
 country
 the
 first


thing
 I
 would
 do
 is
 create
 a
 competency


based
 set
 of
 Assessments
 that
 if
 anyone


did
 it
 these
 count
 as
 good
 or
 better


than
 any
 University
 any
 High
 School
 any


graduate
 program
 and
 then
 you
 allow
 the


world
 to
 create
 resources
 organizations


like
 Khan
 Academy
 to
 create
 resources
 to


prepare
 people
 for
 those
 some
 people


could
 use
 the
 KH
 like
 if
 you
 think
 about


this
 young
 Afghani
 girl
 some
 people
 like


her
 could
 use
 the
 the
 KH
 Academy


resources
 alone
 to
 prepare


and
 then
 take
 these
 assessments
 and
 then


they
 have
 a
 degree
 that's
 better
 than


any
 degree
 but
 if
 a
 lot
 of
 students


would
 need
 more
 supports
 well
 then


that's
 where
 the
 traditional
 school


system
 could
 use
 Khan
 Academy
 plus
 all


of
 the
 inhuman
 the
 the
 the
 main
 not


inhuman
 the
 in-person
 supports
 uh
 to
 to


actually
 support
 these
 students
 more
 so


that's
 where
 I
 would
 put
 a
 lot
 of


resources
 I
 still
 don't
 think
 that
 would


get
 us
 fully
 to
 a
 billion
 dollars
 but


you
 know
 then
 you
 know
 maybe
 I
 I
 I
 would


create
 a
 new
 type
 of
 University
 U
 that


is
 much
 lower
 cost
 and
 much
 more


Hands-On
 and
 you
 know
 gives
 exposure
 to


more
 kids
 the
 credentials
 element
 you


talked
 about
 is
 anybody
 working
 on


creating
 such
 a


thing
 you
 know
 there
 there's
 there's


been
 I
 would
 say
 small
 scale
 badging


initiatives
 type
 of
 things
 but
 I
 don't


think
 anyone
 has


yet
 tackled
 it
 from
 a
 like
 we
 want
 to
 we


don't
 want
 to
 make
 this
 like
 just
 a
 you


got
 you
 know
 you
 took
 a
 moo
 course
 and


you
 got
 a
 badge
 and
 now
 you
 go
 from


being
 a
 general
 computer
 scientist
 to
 a


data
 scientist
 that
 exists
 already
 um


and
 that's
 great
 that
 that
 exists
 that


that
 pathway
 but
 we
 don't
 have
 a
 pathway


right
 now
 that
 says
 hey
 this
 is
 just
 as


good
 as
 Harvard
 um
 if
 you
 do
 this
 you


know
 right
 now
 in
 the
 US
 there's
 all
 of


these
 debates
 about
 you
 know
 you
 have


limited
 seats
 at
 these
 top


universities
 um
 and
 so
 it's
 these


debates
 between
 equity
 and
 Merit
 you


know
 do
 you
 just
 take
 the
 top
 2,000
 kids


at
 Harvard
 every
 year
 or
 do
 you
 make


sure
 it
 represents
 the
 population
 etc


etc
 but
 then
 there's
 questions
 about
 is


it
 Merit
 b
 or
 is
 it
 quot
 so
 people
 are


getting
 they're
 they're
 politically


charged
 and
 you
 know
 I've
 told
 many


University
 presidents
 I
 was
 like
 look


this
 is
 a
 false
 tension
 the
 real
 issue


why
 you're
 while
 you're
 having
 to
 do


this
 game
 is
 because
 you
 cost
 too
 much


and
 you
 don't
 have
 enough
 capacity
 if
 if


you
 could
 bring
 the
 cost
 down
 so
 it's


almost
 free
 like
 the
 actual
 cost
 is


almost
 free
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 have


massive
 government
 subsidy
 and
 um
 you


make
 it
 so
 that
 any
 student
 who's


capable
 of
 doing
 the
 work
 can
 do
 the


work
 then
 anyone
 who
 does
 wants
 to
 do
 it


at
 any
 age
 can
 do
 it
 um
 and
 and
 I
 think


you


know
 if
 if
 if
 I
 had
 my
 DRS
 over
 the
 next


10
 years
 that
 will
 exist
 and
 I
 am


pitching
 that
 to
 folks
 every
 now
 and


then
 do
 you
 think
 AI
 will
 increase
 or


decrease


inequality
 in
 the
 world
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I


think
 there's
 two
 trends
 that
 are
 going


to
 happen
 I
 think
 from
 a
 um
 developing


your
 potential
 point
 of
 view
 I
 do
 think


AI
 is
 going
 to
 improve
 um
 equality
 and


even
 though
 right
 now
 like
 in
 Silicon


Valley
 in
 my
 friend
 Circle
 everyone
 I


know
 is
 super
 AI
 Savvy
 including
 their


kids
 including
 their
 seven-year-olds


they
 already
 know
 how
 to
 prompt
 and
 they


already
 know
 how
 to
 use
 these
 tools


they're
 already
 creating
 videos
 on
 on


you
 know
 these
 generative
 AI
 apps
 and


you
 know
 they're
 using
 them
 for
 their


school
 projects
 and
 so
 in
 the
 short
 term


these
 kids
 and
 these
 families
 have
 a


huge
 Advantage
 but
 what's
 happening
 I


would
 say
 in
 the
 medium
 to
 long
 term
 is


that
 these
 these
 families
 have
 always


had
 a
 huge
 Advantage
 if
 their
 kids
 are


struggling
 they
 hire
 tutors
 for
 their


kids
 and
 paid
 $50
 an
 hour
 $100
 an
 hour


if
 they're
 when
 their
 kids
 apply
 to


college
 they
 hire
 coaches
 for
 their
 kids


these
 families
 themselves
 are
 highly


educated
 and
 often
 times
 have
 more


flexibility
 for
 travel
 and
 to
 tutor


their
 kids
 themselves
 they
 know
 how
 the


system
 works
 I
 mean
 these
 are
 all
 things


you
 know
 I
 know
 how
 the
 system
 works
 and


so
 my
 kids
 are
 going
 to
 have
 that
 that


that
 Advantage
 now
 if
 you're
 bringing
 an


AI
 in
 the
 AI
 overnight
 is
 not
 going
 to


completely
 level
 that
 playing
 field


but
 it's
 going
 to
 allow
 let's
 call
 it


the
 high
 school
 version
 of
 me
 that
 did


not
 have
 those
 advantages
 to
 be
 able
 to


to
 to
 tap
 in
 to
 more
 opportunity
 to
 be


able
 to
 learn
 things
 faster
 to
 be
 able


to
 um
 have
 some
 you
 know
 my
 my
 guidance


counselor
 in
 high
 school
 was
 great
 but


he
 had
 no
 experience
 he
 there
 were
 300


students
 for
 every
 guidance
 counselor
 so


I
 had
 like
 you
 know
 half
 an
 hour
 with


him
 once
 a
 month
 or
 something
 and
 he
 had


no
 experience
 with
 um
 you
 know
 I
 wanted


to
 apply
 to
 MIT
 he
 no
 one
 in
 my
 school


had
 ever
 gotten
 into
 MIT
 so
 he
 had
 no


context
 there
 now
 we
 have
 an
 activity
 on


kigo
 where
 you
 can
 talk
 to
 the
 AI
 and


and
 we've
 had
 some
 of
 the
 top
 college


coaches
 in
 the
 in
 the
 country
 help
 work


with
 that
 AI
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 it's


giving
 the
 best
 advice
 it's
 really


almost
 IND
 you
 know
 indistinguishable


from
 what
 a
 top
 college
 adviser
 would


now
 give
 so
 that
 starts
 to
 level
 the


playing
 field
 and
 over
 time
 it's
 get
 in


educated
 Market
 ineducation
 yeah
 and
 in


uh
 markets
 which
 are
 pretty
 well
 off


what
 about
 then
 Africa


well
 well
 what
 it
 happens
 is
 is
 that
 and


it's
 not
 just
 AI
 it's
 even
 if
 you
 think


about
 tools
 like
 Khan
 Academy
 before
 AI


with
 videos
 and
 exercises
 it
 takes
 the


problem
 of
 education
 and
 say
 you
 know


before
 the
 inequality
 is
 like
 okay
 if


you're
 in
 this
 rural
 Village
 in
 India
 or


Africa
 to
 have
 the
 same
 education
 as


Sal's
 kids
 in
 Mountain
 View
 California


all
 right
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 find
 a


a
 faculty
 and
 is
 there
 any
 is
 there


anyone
 even
 the
 village
 who
 can
 teach


algebra
 or
 calculus
 or
 physics
 you're


going
 to
 have
 to
 find
 a
 facility
 you're


going
 to
 have
 to
 maybe
 be
 flexible


around
 these
 kids
 might
 have
 other


family
 responsibilities
 like
 it
 it's
 it


was
 an
 expensive
 proposition
 and
 the


world
 has
 been
 trying
 to
 do
 it
 for


hundreds
 of
 years
 and
 frankly
 hasn't


been
 able
 to
 pull
 it
 off
 with
 tools
 like


KH
 Academy
 and
 especially
 as
 you
 start


introducing
 the
 AI
 the
 problem
 becomes


much
 more
 of
 hey
 can
 we
 get
 people


devices
 and
 internet
 access
 at
 least
 to


start
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that
 that's


equivalent
 to
 a
 full
 school
 but
 at
 least


it
 raises
 the
 floor
 pretty
 dramatically


and
 then
 if
 you
 want
 to
 create
 a
 school


the
 problem
 is
 no
 longer
 you
 need
 to


find
 someone
 who's
 a
 master
 of
 physics


you
 just
 you
 just
 have
 to
 create
 a
 nice


safe
 environment
 have
 access
 to


resources
 the
 adults
 in
 the
 room
 just


have
 to
 motivate
 keep
 the
 kids
 motivated


and
 on
 task
 but
 then
 they
 could
 use
 some


of
 these
 tools
 for
 some
 of
 the
 content


expertise
 it's
 great
 if
 those
 adults


have
 it
 but
 they
 don't
 have
 to
 have
 it


so
 I
 think
 it
 starts
 to
 level
 the


playing
 field
 there
 once
 again
 not
 going


to
 completely
 level
 it
 but
 it's
 going
 to


be
 more
 level
 than
 it
 than
 it
 is
 today


the
 place
 where
 I'm
 most
 worried
 about


AI
 unleveling
 the
 plane
 field
 and
 we've


we've
 to
 some
 degree
 seen
 this
 trend


over
 the
 last
 30
 40
 years
 with
 with


technology
 generally
 is
 for
 those
 who


know
 how
 to
 use
 these
 tools
 it
 massively


improves
 productivity
 but
 what
 it
 does


is
 it
 concentrates
 that
 productivity
 in


a
 smaller
 and
 smaller
 group
 of
 people


what
 used
 to


take
 you
 know
 it
 used
 50
 years
 ago
 if
 I


told
 you
 I
 have
 a
 even
 if
 you
 adjust
 for


inflation
 if
 if
 you
 have
 the
 equivalent


of
 a
 billion
 dollar
 company
 today
 people


would
 assume
 that
 company
 must
 have


100,000
 employees


when
 WhatsApp
 sold
 to
 meta
 for
 $18


billion
 doar
 it
 had
 18
 employees
 and


this
 is
 before
 AI
 they
 weren't
 even


using
 you
 know
 coding
 co-pilots
 to
 write


that
 code
 but
 18
 employees
 were
 able
 to


create
 an18
 billion
 doll
 company
 I
 think


over
 the
 next
 10
 15
 years
 you're
 going


to
 see
 five
 10
 person
 companies
 using
 AI


create
 billions
 of
 dollars
 in
 value
 now


that
 could
 be
 overall
 good
 for
 society


it's
 going
 to
 create
 tools
 that
 increase


productivity
 or
 entertainment
 or


whatever
 but
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 wealth's


going
 to
 acrw
 to
 a
 very
 small


concentrated
 people
 and
 if
 it
 used
 to


take
 100,000
 people
 to
 do
 it
 and
 now


you're
 able
 to
 do
 it
 with
 10
 people
 well


what
 happens
 to
 the
 other
 what
 what


happens
 to
 the
 other


99,99
 people
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 in
 terms
 of


work
 um
 now
 there
 are
 some
 good
 utopian


scenarios
 where
 it
 frees
 up
 resources


for
 for
 more
 human-
 centered
 work
 for


nursing
 Health
 Care
 education
 teaching


but
 then
 there's
 dystopian
 scenarios


where
 these
 people
 get
 marginalized


destabilizes
 countries
 maybe
 you
 have
 to


do
 Mass
 redistribution
 and
 even
 Mass


dist
 redistribution
 whatever
 people's


views
 are
 on
 that
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


good
 for
 the
 people
 who
 get
 it
 because


they
 lose
 their
 sense
 of
 purpose
 they're


like
 well
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 I'm
 what
 I'm


contributing
 so
 I
 think
 this
 is


something
 we
 have
 to
 tackle
 and
 honestly


the
 best
 way
 to
 tackle
 it
 is
 is
 to
 let


as
 many
 of
 those
 people
 as
 possible


learn
 how
 to
 use
 these
 Technologies
 and


learn
 how
 to
 how
 to
 leverage
 them


absolutely
 talking
 about
 smaller


smallish
 companies
 we
 achieve
 um
 amazing


things
 I
 know
 about
 this
 company
 called


K
 Academy
 they
 got
 roughly
 200
 people


and
 they
 educating
 M
 educating
 millions


of
 people
 unbelievable
 now
 how
 do
 you


how
 do
 you
 run
 the
 organization
 what
 are


your
 leadership


principles
 um
 you
 know
 I
 I've
 I've
 I've


never
 written
 them
 down
 but
 if
 I
 were
 to


say


um
 you
 know
 what
 what
 I
 implicitly
 like


to
 happen
 is
 you
 know
 try
 to
 be
 as
 close


to
 to
 to
 the
 users
 as
 possible
 uh
 this


is
 something
 I
 still
 do
 I
 still
 make


video
 videos
 I
 still
 uh
 you
 know
 one


reason
 why
 I
 started
 a
 school
 the
 one


school
 my
 kids
 go
 to
 is
 so
 that
 I
 can


under
 I
 can
 be
 close
 to
 Learners
 and


understand
 what
 their
 and
 teachers
 and


understand
 what
 their
 lives
 are
 like
 uh


a
 flat
 organization
 as
 much
 as
 possible


uh
 right
 now
 you
 know
 there's
 you
 know


one
 we
 have
 direct
 lines
 of


communication
 between
 me
 and
 any
 member


of
 the
 organization
 but
 you
 know
 there's


there's
 only
 two
 levels
 of
 management
 at


most
 but
 even
 then
 it's
 fairly
 porous
 so


we
 try
 to
 do
 that
 we
 try
 to
 keep
 pushing


ourselves
 to
 avoid
 bureaucracy
 you
 do


need
 some
 processes
 as
 you
 grow
 and
 you


scale
 to
 have
 Drive
 alignment
 and
 make


sure
 things
 are
 happening
 as
 they
 should


but
 we're
 always
 questioning
 it
 we're


trying
 to
 have
 first
 principles
 thinking


around
 like
 do
 we
 need
 that
 meeting
 does


it
 need
 to
 be
 run
 in
 that
 way


um
 are
 there
 ways
 that
 we
 could
 do
 this


different
 so
 that
 we
 we
 can
 get
 more


scale
 and
 leverage
 and
 you
 know
 one
 of


the
 things
 I


found
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 people
 think
 about


the
 size
 of
 an
 organization
 and
 it
 is


true
 the
 main
 cost
 in
 organizations


these
 days
 is
 salaries
 but
 the
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 to
 keep
 an
 organization
 is


small
 small
 as
 possible
 isn't


necessarily
 like
 cost
 savings
 it's


actually
 communication
 and
 being
 able
 to


be
 nimble
 if
 Khan
 Academy
 last
 year
 was


a
 20,000
 person
 organization
 I
 don't


think
 there
 was
 any
 way
 that
 I
 would


have
 been
 able
 to
 make
 this
 move
 into
 AI


that
 we
 did
 even
 with
 250
 people
 it
 it


wasn't
 easy
 it's
 still
 you
 know
 we're


not
 a
 we're
 not
 a
 speedboat
 we're
 kind


of
 a
 yeah
 I
 don't
 know
 like
 a
 catamaran


maybe
 like
 you
 know
 but
 we're
 not
 a


cruise
 ship
 either
 and
 that
 cruise
 ship


was
 very
 hard
 to
 change
 turn
 around
 when


you
 realize
 that
 there's
 an
 iceberg
 if


you
 don't
 if
 you
 if
 you
 don't
 turn


around
 um
 so
 so
 I
 think
 in
 in
 you
 know


going
 forward
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 even


more
 important
 than
 than
 you
 know
 it's


not
 about
 saving
 money
 and
 obviously
 we


are
 limited
 by
 resources
 because
 we're


we
 we
 raise
 primarily
 through


philanthropy
 but
 it's
 more
 about
 being


able
 to
 stay
 Nimble
 if
 you
 personally


were
 to
 do
 another
 degree
 what
 would
 you


do
 oh
 if
 I
 were
 to
 do
 another
 degree


that's
 a
 good
 question
 um
 part
 of
 me
 you


know
 when
 I
 went
 into
 college
 I
 I


thought
 I
 wanted
 to
 be
 a
 theoretical


physicist
 CU
 I
 just
 wanted
 to
 understand


the
 nature
 of
 reality
 um
 now
 I've
 kind


of
 reached
 the
 conclusion
 I
 should
 just


meditate
 my
 way
 there
 but
 theoretical


physics
 is
 still
 is
 is
 still
 um
 an
 area


that
 I
 you
 know
 my
 my
 oldest
 son
 is
 kind


of
 almost
 caught
 up
 with
 me
 in
 terms
 of


uh
 his
 math
 and
 science
 and
 I
 said
 okay


when
 you
 catch
 up
 with
 me
 we're
 going
 to


start
 studying
 quantum
 physics
 together


so
 that
 so
 that
 so
 that
 I
 can
 I
 can
 you


know
 uh
 uh
 I
 I
 want
 to
 understand
 the


frontiers
 of
 of
 of
 of
 reality
 of
 of
 how


we
 how
 we
 understand


reality
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 better
 to
 have


one
 PhD
 or
 to
 mil


degrees
 it
 depends
 what
 you're
 trying
 to


do
 in
 the
 world
 you
 should
 be
 doing
 it


because
 it's
 you
 you
 have
 a
 clear
 idea


of
 of
 why
 of
 why
 you're
 doing
 it
 now
 you


know
 I
 saying
 that
 I
 was
 the
 guy
 who


just
 said
 I
 went
 to
 business
 school
 not


knowing
 what
 to
 do
 I
 used
 that
 as
 a


reason
 to
 figure
 out
 and
 I
 think
 there


are
 some
 degree
 programs
 like
 mbas
 that


are
 are
 good
 for
 just
 kind
 of
 figuring


out
 what
 you
 want
 to
 do
 but
 I
 knew
 I


wanted
 to
 do
 something
 in
 Industry
 uh
 at


least
 I
 thought
 I
 did
 it's
 funny
 the


only
 class
 I
 HB
 Harvard
 doesn't
 fail
 you


anyone
 in
 the
 business
 school
 but
 they


tell
 you
 internally
 that
 you
 would
 have


failed
 if
 the
 only
 class
 that
 I
 was
 very


cynical
 about
 that
 I
 kind
 of
 got
 the


equivalent
 of
 a
 failing
 grade
 was
 called


uh
 social
 entrepreneurship
 and
 and
 it


was
 and
 and
 it
 was
 because
 I
 was
 such
 a


cynic
 in
 that
 class
 I
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of


the
 cases
 we
 studied
 were
 you
 know


someone's
 organizing
 a
 bicycle
 ride
 to


cure
 some
 disease
 and
 I
 remember


speaking
 up
 in
 class
 and
 saying
 well


that's
 not
 going
 to
 cure
 the
 disease


it's
 just
 a
 bicycle
 ride
 like
 how
 is


that
 going
 to
 cure
 the
 disease
 and
 most


of
 the
 money
 is
 going
 to
 fund
 all
 of
 the


the
 pageantry
 around
 the
 ride
 so
 you


could
 and
 I
 later
 realized
 the
 professor


organized
 that
 that
 charity
 so
 it
 was


not
 good
 but
 the
 um
 and
 I
 now
 come


around
 I
 now
 see
 the
 importance
 of
 those


types
 of
 things
 because
 they
 they
 they


bring
 awareness
 to
 to
 an
 effort
 but
 it


is
 there
 is
 an
 irony
 year
 that
 I
 I
 go
 to


business
 school
 fail
 social


entrepreneurship
 and
 that's
 what
 I
 do


now
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you
 read
 these


days
 oh
 I
 you
 know
 I
 I
 I
 for
 the
 most


part
 flip-flop
 between
 um
 hard
 science


fiction
 and
 Victorian
 era
 Classics
 and


uh
 you
 know
 all
 those
 V
 I
 just
 read
 um


Great
 Expectations
 the
 first
 time
 I
 read


it
 was
 in
 sth
 grade
 I
 hated
 it
 when
 it


was
 forced
 on
 me
 in
 seventh
 grade
 they


should
 not
 make
 seventh
 graders
 read


that
 especially
 seventh
 grade
 boys
 read


that
 unless
 they
 really
 want
 to
 they


shouldn't
 Force
 anyone
 to
 do
 it
 um


because
 you
 don't
 appreciate
 it
 I
 read


it
 just
 now
 I'm
 like
 this
 is
 the
 most


amazing
 book
 there's
 like
 so
 much
 wisdom


and
 wit
 it's
 hilarious
 and
 it's
 modern


in
 so
 many
 ways
 so
 I
 you
 know
 I
 I


flip-flop
 between
 revisiting
 the
 great


Classics
 that
 I
 was
 forced
 to
 read
 in


school
 and
 now
 I
 have
 I
 can
 read
 it


properly
 so
 I
 love
 doing
 that
 and
 then
 I


you
 know
 and
 I
 read
 a
 lot
 of
 hard


science
 fiction
 uh
 you
 know
 I've
 always


been
 fans
 of
 like
 azimoff
 and
 Arthur
 C


Clark
 and
 and
 now
 I'm
 just
 making
 sure


I'm
 reading
 all
 of
 their
 books
 you
 know


I've
 read
 their
 their
 most
 notable
 books


but
 now
 I'm
 reading
 all
 of
 them
 how
 do


you
 encourage
 um
 adults
 and
 grown-ups
 to


continue
 to
 learn
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 their


lives
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 it
 is
 it
 innate


or
 is
 it
 something
 that
 can
 be


encouraged
 you
 know
 we
 get
 letters
 we
 I


mean
 tens
 of
 letters
 a
 day
 we
 get
 from


folks
 saying
 I
 thought
 I
 was
 bad
 at
 math


I
 just
 started
 doing
 30
 40
 minutes
 a


week
 just
 to
 keep
 my
 brain
 fresh
 and
 I


realized
 I
 love
 it
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 are


like
 angry
 because
 they're
 now
 30
 or
 40


years
 old
 and
 they're
 like
 I
 wish


someone
 exposed
 me
 exposed
 this
 to
 me


this
 way
 when
 I
 was
 12
 um
 so
 I
 would


just
 say
 just
 start
 learning
 and
 it


doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 through
 Khan
 Academy


obviously
 Khan
 Academy
 is
 there
 but
 just


reading
 exploring
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of


these
 AI
 tools
 are
 fascinating
 to
 have


conversations
 with
 a
 kigo
 you
 can
 have
 a


Socratic
 dialogue
 you
 can
 get
 into


debates
 I
 personally
 really
 enjoy
 it


when
 I
 when
 I
 have
 time
 to
 to
 dig
 into
 a


debate
 that
 I'm
 you
 know
 I'm
 dying
 to


have
 uh
 but
 I
 can't
 find
 someone
 to
 have


with
 me


well
 it's
 been
 um
 it's
 been
 amazing
 to


have
 a
 dialogue
 with
 you
 s
 and
 um
 I
 have


to
 say
 I
 can't
 think
 of
 anybody
 who's


done
 more
 for
 for
 learning
 in
 the
 whole


world
 so
 uh
 a
 big
 thank
 you
 and
 on


behalf
 of
 of
 everybody
 really
 and
 um


you're
 for
 sure
 passed
 that
 class
 in


social
 entrepreneurship
 so
 big


congratulations
 a
 real
 life
 class
 it's


been
 tremendous
 Master
 learning
 based


maybe
 a
 big
 thank
 you
 uh
 keep
 it
 up
 and


uh
 look
 forward
 to
 staying
 in
 touch


great
 thanks
 for
 having
 me
