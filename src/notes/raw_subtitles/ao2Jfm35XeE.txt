- [Ken] Now, I'm gonna turn on 2000 volts.
- [Derek] What?
And this is the first step
in creating snowflakes in the lab.
This is totally wild.
What?
- Crazy, huh?
The tips of those needles are
like a hundred nanometers in diameter.
- [Derek] That is so wild.
Dr. Ken Libbrecht is the snowflake guy.
- I was the snowflake consultant
for the movie, "Frozen."
It's okay to conjure snowflakes
out of your fingertips,
but they have to be real snowflakes,
or people aren't buying it.
(Ken and Derek laughing)
The US Post Office made snowflake
stamps using my pictures.
It's not the kind of thing
you normally think of
when you start doing physics,
that you'd be on a postage stamp.
- [Derek] You've written the
book on snowflakes, literally.
- So I had like two
successful books in a row,
so we just kept making books,
until finally (laughing)
they sold zero copies,
and then we stopped.
(dramatic orchestral music)
- So, are you kind of
like a snowflake artist?
- I call it a designer snowflake.
Because yes, I am
designing this on the fly.
I don't have a computer
that does all this for me.
I just do it by hand, so every
one's a little different.
- [Derek] Ken knows so
much about snowflakes,
he can design and construct
them to his own specifications.
- [Ken] So what's happening
now is it's growing
and doing its thing at some...
It's at -13 Celsius now, but
I want to make some branches.
I'll just turn this down to -15.
And then I'm gonna increase
the humidity a little bit,
the super saturation,
and you'll start to see
branches come out there.
- [Derek] See you
changing those conditions,
just caused the plate to kind
of stop and become really--
- I changed the growth
conditions to prefer branches.
This little thing right
there, that little nub,
that's the only thing that
touches the sapphire substrate.
The rest of this is all growing above.
This increases the air flow.
Those are droplets forming,
and now I'm really kicking it into gear.
(mystical orchestral music)
Now, what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna turn that
humidity down to zero,
so the droplets are starting to recede,
and this will stop growing
and kind of start to facet a little bit.
Let's say I want branches again,
now I'm gonna really hammer on it.
- [Derek] So you're giving
it a lot of moisture.
- A lot of moisture now, but
you'll see side branches.
You really start to feel you
understand what's going on,
when you can say, "Now I'm gonna do this,"
and then it happens.
It's fun. I can predict the future.
(laughing)
I like to think they're
better than nature,
and the reason is that
the facets of just sharp.
All the edges on these things
are just sharp and crisp,
whereas in the sky they have to fall,
and by the time they fall,
and you pick them up,
and you put them under a microscope,
they've started to evaporate a little.
Boy, these are just,
(snaps) bang, just crisp.
- [Derek] The first close-up
photograph of a snowflake
in the wild was taken in 1885
by American meteorologist,
Wilson A. Bentley.
It was Bentley who originated the idea
that no two snowflakes are
alike, and he would know.
Over the course of his life,
he took more than 5,000
photos of snowflakes,
a selection of which appear
in his book, "Snow Crystals,"
which is still in print today.
But most snowflakes don't look
like the ones Bentley photographed,
because he selected only
those in pristine condition
with uncommon beauty and symmetry.
- I mean, when you're
looking for snowflakes,
I'll take a big piece of cardboard,
and you just glance at it.
(exhaling)
Crap, nothing, brush them aside, more.
No, each brush is a thousand snowflakes.
They're hard to find.
They're one in a million,
I mean, literally.
- [Derek] We are all so used
to seeing pictures like this,
that we are blind to the
mysteries of the snowflake.
Like, why do they all have
six fold, radial symmetry?
Why are they so intricate,
and yet so different from each other?
How do opposite arms of a snowflake
mirror each other so perfectly?
I mean, how does one side
of the snowflake know
what the other side is doing?
And why are snowflakes flat?
They're usually millimeters in diameter,
but micro meters thick.
The edges of a plate can be
as narrow as razorblades,
but the mystery goes even deeper.
Everyone pictures snowflakes like this,
but the truth is they take
all sorts of different forms,
like this, a hollow column.
That is a snowflake?
- [Dr. Libbrecht] That is a snowflake.
- [Derek] There are also
needles, cups and bullets.
- This is like my favorite
kind of snowflake.
It is a capped column.
It started out growing as a column,
but then the temperature changed,
and then you've got plates
growing on either end.
(bright orchestral music)
It's just a cacophony of different shapes.
All of these appear spontaneously.
There's no DNA or any kind of a blueprint
for what's going on.
It's just water vapor freezing into ice,
and all this happens.
- [Derek] So you've identified
35 different types of snowflakes.
- Yes, there's no really one way
to define a type of snowflake.
The first chart of snowflakes
is like 41, I think,
and then it got bigger - 60 or 70,
and the latest one by
some Japanese physicists,
I think had 108 different
types of snowflakes,
and I found 108 was too many.
(Ken laughs)
(snow blowing)
- [Derek] How does simple ice
create so many distinct forms?
(curious orchestral music)
All snowflakes form in much the same way.
Water evaporates into water vapor,
individual molecules bouncing
around in the atmosphere,
and as this vapor rises,
it cools and becomes super saturated,
meaning there are more
water molecules in the air
than there would be in
equilibrium at this temperature.
Water molecules condense
onto dust particles
to form tiny droplets.
And although the temperature
may be below freezing,
the droplets don't immediately freeze,
but at some point, one
droplet will freeze.
Inside, the water
molecules lock into place,
forming a hexagonal crystal.
This structure results
from the peculiarities
of water molecules.
Oxygen atoms attract
electrons more than hydrogen.
And since the molecule has a bent shape,
it's polar with oxygen
being slightly negative,
and the hydrogens, slightly positive.
Since unlike charges attract,
hydrogen from one molecule
will sit next to an oxygen
from another molecule,
forming a so-called hydrogen bond,
and this is what creates the
hexagonal molecular lattice.
But how does this microscopic lattice
grow into a hexagonal
crystal that we can see?
- So you start with a chunk of ice,
and these little guys are
meant to be water molecules.
And what happens is there
are these flat surfaces,
which are the facet surfaces,
and at a molecular scale,
they're very smooth and flat.
And so when a molecule hits,
a water vapor molecule hits
that smooth and flat surface,
it tends to bounce off,
whereas here, it's rough.
There are a lot of dangling
molecular bonds over here.
That's a rough surface.
And so when these molecules
hit, they tend to stick.
It's a statistical thing, of course,
but the probabilities are
high that they stick here
and low that they stick here.
So if you take any shape,
and you just let it grow
for a little while, the
rough areas fill in,
and the flat areas don't grow very fast,
and you end up with a faceted shape.
- [Derek] And that's how we
get from the quantum mechanics
that governs a water molecule,
to a hexagonal prism of ice.
This prism has two basal
facets and six prism facets,
which is important.
If the basal facets grow
fast, you get a column.
If the prism facets grow faster,
you get a flat snowflake.
Once there is a seed crystal,
nearby water droplets evaporate
and deposit water molecules
onto the growing snowflake.
Since the corners of the
hexagonal prism stick out farther
into humid air, they grow faster,
and now they extend even farther,
so they grow even faster in
a positive feedback loop.
This gives rise to six radial branches.
At the corners of these branches,
additional branches can
form for the same reason.
Around a hundred thousand droplets
are required to make a single snowflake,
and the process usually
takes 30 to 45 minutes.
In the 1930s, Ukichiro Nakaya
was systematically studying snowflakes
at the University of Hokkaido in Japan.
He discovered that the
different types of snowflakes
don't all occur under the same conditions.
Instead, two factors,
the temperature and
level of super saturation
determine what type of snowflake grows.
His findings are summarized
in the Nakaya Diagram,
but it's not a simple pattern.
Around -2 Celsius, you get plates.
At -5 Celsius, columns and needles form.
At -15 Celsius, it's plates again,
and then below -20, you
get columns and plates.
The Nakaya Diagram allows us
to understand a rough
history of any snowflake.
Does each snowflake in
essence reveal its history
through its shape?
- Yeah, absolutely, to some degree.
You can definitely look
at a snowflake and say,
"Yeah, I know what conditions
"that crystal grew under, more or less."
Your typical weather
patterns, fronts, cold front,
that produces a lot of capped columns,
because as the cloud moves
up, it starts to get colder
and initially start to
freeze at around -6, -10.
That makes columns, and as it gets colder,
then it makes branches and plates,
and so you get capped columns.
- [Derek] This also explains
why snowflakes are so intricate.
The temperature and humidity
at each moment of growth
determines the structures
formed in that moment.
The symmetry you see
is not because one side
somehow knows what the
other side is doing,
but because both sides of
a single snowflake grow
in the exact same conditions.
- When the crystal changes its position,
the temperature will change, say,
and all six branches will see
the same temperature change,
and so they'll all respond the same way.
- [Derek] Different
snowflakes, on the other hand,
each take a unique path,
and therefore they experience
a unique set of conditions,
which is why no two snowflakes are alike.
But in the lab, you can
carefully control the conditions,
so theoretically it should be possible
to create almost identical
snowflakes, and indeed, Ken has.
What's in here?
- Poke your flashlight
in there, and you'll see.
- [Derek] Ah ha, I'm imagining
these are seed crystals of a sort?
- [Ken] Those are a little
sparkly snow crystals.
- [Derek] Yeah.
- You know this is another little chamber.
It's just a cold plate,
and there's a little
sapphire disc in there,
and then I'm going to push
this thing, my sapphire,
all the way in here, and the
crystals will waft onto to it
and hopefully stay there.
The idea popped in, it's like,
oh, if I grow two next to one another,
they'll be kind of identical,
and I call them identical twin snowflakes,
'cause they're like identical twin people.
They're not exactly the same,
but clearly more alike
than you would ever expect.
(gentle orchestral music)
Is it really true that no
two snowflakes are alike?
You know, that's just a silly question.
(Ken laughs)
It's silly because no two trees are like,
no two grains of sand are like,
no two anything are alike.
Anything that has any complexity
is different from everything else,
because once you introduce complexity,
then there's just an uncountable
number of ways to make it.
- [Derek] If a pair of twins snowflakes
are growing too close together,
they end up competing for
moisture between them,
stunting both of their growths.
The Nakaya Diagram allows
us to understand a lot
about snowflake formation.
Ken has used his experiments
to build his own version of the chart.
But what it doesn't explain
is why do ice crystals form
this way in the first place?
I mean, why do we get
plates and then columns
and then plates and columns again?
This has been a mystery,
essentially since Nakaya
introduced his diagram
back in the 1930s, but Ken
believes he now has an answer.
Anytime you have a crystal,
the reason why you get
these smooth flat facets
is because it's not easy to
grow more crystal on top.
There are so-called nucleation barriers.
What you need is a critical
density of additional molecules
of the substance before
they can come together
to form a little island that
is stable enough to grow
and add another layer onto the crystal.
When you're first forming a snowflake,
you're always gonna start
with a hexagonal prism
with its two basal facets
and six prism facets around the side.
And the nucleation barrier
for the basal facets
is different than that
of the prism facets.
If the nucleation barrier is
lower for the prism facets,
then they grow faster, and
you get plate like structures.
If the nucleation barrier is
lower for the basal facets,
then they grow faster,
and you end up with
column-like structures.
Now, the nucleation barriers of ice
are known as a function of temperature,
and this explains why around -2,
the prism facets grow
faster, and you get plates,
because their nucleation barrier is lower.
You can also see why below -20 or so,
well then you get columns,
because the basal facet
nucleation barrier is lower
at those temperatures.
But what doesn't make sense
is why we should get columns
at around -5 Celsius and
then plates again at -15.
So what is happening?
Well Ken's hypothesis is that
these nucleation barriers
are valid only for large flat facets,
but if you had really narrow facets,
well, the nucleation
barriers would be different.
So Ken proposes that narrow basal facets
have a dip in their nucleation
barrier around -4 Celsius,
and narrow prism facets have a dip at -15,
so his hypothesis is that the
graph should look like this.
This then is consistent
with all the different forms
of snowflakes that grow
at different temperatures.
But what accounts for these dips?
Well, let's say we have
a narrow prism facet,
so we're growing a plate snowflake.
Water molecules that hit the basal facets
are unlikely to reach the
critical density required
to overcome the nucleation barrier,
so that surface grows only slowly.
But on either side of
this narrow prism facet,
water molecules can
stick on the rough edges,
and to minimize surface energy,
the ideal shape of this
face would be semicircular.
But if only the top few layers
of water molecules are mobile
to try to lower the surface energy,
many of them diffuse onto the prism facet
and in the process,
they exceed the critical density required
to overcome the nucleation barrier,
and so they can grow the
crystal on the prism facet.
So due to this narrow edge,
the nucleation barrier
is effectively lower than it would be
for a large prism facet.
A similar effect happens
for the basal facets,
just at a different temperature.
And Ken has done
experiments to investigate
whether these effects
are observed in the lab.
- And so I did a series of
experiments using that apparatus
and man, it's just like,
boom, just like that.
(laughing) Whoa!
When you make a model,
and you sort of find it's
supposed to do something,
and it sorta does, it's just
like, this might be right!
- So far, the results agree
nicely with the hypothesis.
So after 85 years, maybe we now understand
the molecular physics of ice well enough
to finally explain why snowflakes grow
into such a diverse collection
of columnar and plate-like forms.
- And I've done a lot of my career
in astronomy and astrophysics.
Nobody ever asks you what
it's good for, I mean, never.
Not even once did anyone say,
"What are those black holes
gonna be used for?" No,
(Ken and Derek laughing)
Saturn's rings, "Why do you
care about Saturn's rings?
"What's the motivation
for studying Saturn,"
nobody asks that.
Every time I give a talk, people are like,
"What are you doing? What
on earth is this for?"
I'll tell you the real reason,
the real reason that I got into this.
You look at a snowflake
and you kind of go,
"Um, actually, (laughs)
we don't have any idea
"how that works."
Well, that doesn't work.
We have to know how that works, dammit!
Well, I want to be the guy
that figures out how snowflakes work.
That's always been a driver.
You know, as a scientist, you
want to figure something out.
