Welcome.
 Today
 uh
 I'm
 very
 excited
 for


this
 all-in
 interview
 with
 this
 week's


Nobel
 laureate,
 winner
 of
 the
 Nobel


Prize
 in
 physics
 in
 2025,
 John
 Martinez.


John,
 welcome
 to
 the
 all-in
 interview.


>> Yeah,
 thanks
 for
 inviting
 me.
 Um
 I'm


quite
 excited
 about
 this
 uh
 this
 talk


and
 uh
 you
 know,
 love
 to
 explain
 to


people
 about
 you
 know,
 what
 this
 prize


is
 all
 about.


>> All
 right,
 besties.
 I
 think
 that
 was


another
 epic
 discussion.
 People
 love
 the


interviews.
 I
 could
 hear
 him
 talk
 for


hours.
 Absolutely.
 Oh,
 he
 crushed
 your


questions
 in
 a
 minute.


>> We
 are
 giving
 people
 ground
 truth
 data


to
 underwrite
 your
 own
 opinion.
 What
 did


you
 guys
 think?
 That
 was
 fun.
 That
 was


great.


[Music]


>> Well,
 the
 Nobel
 Prize
 is
 the
 most


prestigious
 honor
 and
 particularly
 in


physics
 that
 I
 think
 can
 be
 awarded.


You're
 in
 the
 record
 books.
 It's
 going


to
 be
 an
 incredible
 ceremony
 coming
 up


for
 you.
 Maybe
 we
 could
 go
 back
 to
 the


beginning
 in
 your
 history.
 I'd
 love
 to


hear
 a
 little
 bit
 about,
 you
 know,
 where


did
 you
 grow
 up
 and
 how
 did
 you
 get


started
 with
 your
 interest
 in
 physics?


>> Uh,
 well,
 so
 I
 uh
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 San


Pedro,
 California,
 and
 uh,
 you
 know,


grew
 up
 there
 my
 whole
 time.
 My
 my


father
 was
 a
 fireman
 and
 my
 mom
 stayed


at
 home,
 took
 care
 of
 us,
 and
 um,
 you


know,
 through
 the
 years
 I
 was
 always


interested
 in
 science,
 technology.
 I'm


going
 to
 say
 one
 of
 the
 things
 is,
 you


know,
 my
 my
 dad,
 you
 know,
 actually


didn't
 have
 a
 high
 school
 education,
 but


very
 smart
 person.
 He
 was
 always


building
 things
 in
 the
 garage,
 various


projects.
 So,
 I
 grew
 up
 kind
 of
 knowing


how
 to
 build
 things,
 which
 also
 kind
 of


tells
 you
 how
 things
 work,
 you
 know,


kind
 of
 empirical
 view,
 you
 know,


tactical
 view
 of
 how
 physics
 works.
 So


uh
 when
 I
 took
 physics
 in
 high
 school,
 I


actually
 loved
 it
 because
 there
 was


actually
 some
 math
 behind
 it
 and


concepts
 and
 you
 know
 really
 made
 sense


to
 me
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 I
 just
 really


you
 know
 fell
 in
 love
 with
 the
 subject


and
 then
 went
 to
 UC
 Berkeley
 and
 and
 did


pretty
 well
 there
 and
 enjoyed
 it.
 Uh


enjoyed
 it
 a
 lot.
 And
 then
 in
 my
 senior


year
 at
 UC
 Berkeley
 I
 had
 a
 class
 from


John
 Clark
 who
 was
 my
 adviser
 and
 found


out
 what
 he
 was
 doing.
 and
 he
 was
 just


starting
 to
 look
 at
 these
 quantum


mechanics
 and
 electrical
 devices
 stuff


and
 it
 sounded
 really
 interesting
 for


me.
 I
 guess
 I
 have,
 you
 know,
 I
 guess
 I


could
 see
 maybe
 when
 something
 maybe


would
 would
 take
 off.
 So
 I
 started
 to
 to


uh
 to
 to
 do
 the
 graduate
 school
 work


with
 him.


>> You
 went
 to
 Berkeley
 for
 graduate


school.


>> I
 went
 to
 Gertie
 for
 graduate
 school,


which
 you're
 not
 supposed
 to
 do.


>> I
 was
 originally
 a
 physics
 and
 math


undergrad
 at
 Cal.


>> Okay.
 I
 changed
 my
 major
 later
 and


actually
 got
 my
 degree
 in
 astrophysics.


There
 was
 some
 upper
 division
 math
 class


that
 really
 turned
 me
 off
 to
 math
 as
 a


major.
 There
 was
 just
 so
 many
 proofs.
 It


drove
 me
 nuts.


>> Right.
 Right.


>> And
 then
 physics
 was
 always
 exciting,


but
 I
 liked
 uh
 working
 in
 the
 astro
 lab


and
 I
 worked
 actually
 at
 Lawrence


Berkeley
 Lab.


>> Oh,
 okay.
 Yeah.


>> But
 then
 you
 you
 stayed
 at
 Berkeley
 and


went
 to
 grad
 school,
 right?


>> Yeah,
 I
 stayed
 at
 Berkeley,
 went
 to
 grad


school.
 We
 started
 this
 project
 a
 couple


years
 into
 grad
 school.
 I
 forget
 exact


date.
 And
 what
 was
 interesting
 is
 this


was
 a
 question
 that
 was
 actually
 posed


by
 professor
 Anthony
 Leget
 who
 won
 the


Nobel
 Prize
 for
 you
 know
 helium
 3
 you


know
 physics
 uh
 in
 I
 think
 20
 2003


>> was
 that
 super
 fluid


>> super
 fluid
 helium
 3.
 Yeah
 that's
 right.


>> So
 he
 showed
 like
 if
 you
 put
 helium
 3


cold
 enough
 it
 kind
 of
 almost
 has
 this


new
 sort
 of
 characteristic
 with
 the


physics
 and
 how
 it
 moves
 and
 how
 it


works.
 Well,
 it
 has
 a
 this
 super
 fluid


behavior,
 but
 it
 has
 a
 very
 complicated


behavior
 because
 of
 the
 more
 complicated


nuclei
 of
 the
 helium
 3.
 And


>> this
 had
 been
 discovered
 and
 people


worked
 for
 a
 while
 to
 figure
 that
 out.


And
 he,
 you
 know,
 helped
 develop
 the


theory
 for
 that.
 So,
 he
 was
 quite


wellknown,
 very,
 very
 smart
 person.
 And


although
 he
 won
 the
 Nobel
 Prize
 for


that,
 okay,
 there's
 not
 much
 helium
 3


physics
 going
 on,
 but
 for
 the
 question


that
 led
 to
 our
 experiment,
 okay,


there's
 a
 huge
 field.
 And
 the
 question


was,
 do
 macroscopic


objects
 behave
 quantum
 mechanically?


Okay,
 and
 this
 is
 a
 macroscopic
 object


might
 be
 a
 small
 ball.
 In
 our
 case,
 it's


an
 electrical
 circuit
 with
 billions
 of


electrons
 in
 it,
 billions
 of
 atom
 and
 is


the
 collective
 motion
 of
 say
 the
 ball
 uh


quantum
 mechanical.
 Now,
 you
 know,
 if


you
 think
 about
 throwing
 throwing
 a
 ball


against
 the
 wall,
 it's
 going
 to
 bounce


off.
 But
 if
 you
 make
 the
 wall
 thin


enough
 and
 the
 ball
 light
 enough,
 it'll


then
 every
 once
 in
 a
 while
 tunnel


through
 because
 of
 the,
 you
 know,
 laws


of
 quantum
 mechanics.
 So,
 um


>> hold
 on,
 let's
 just
 pause
 on
 that
 for
 a


second.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 really
 worth


spending
 a
 moment
 on.


>> Yeah.
 Great.


>> So
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 quantum
 mechanics,


when
 we
 talk
 about
 the
 relative
 position


or
 energy
 or
 movement
 of
 a
 particle
 at


the
 atomic
 scale
 as
 small
 as
 an
 atom
 or


smaller
 than
 an
 atom,
 we
 have
 to
 use


kind
 of
 probabilities
 to
 describe
 where


things
 are
 going
 to
 be.
 That
 was
 what


was
 really
 kind
 of
 the
 big
 understanding


of
 quantum
 mechanics
 in
 the
 early
 20th


century,
 right?
 is
 that
 there's


>> the
 probability
 of
 things
 being
 where


they
 are
 and
 moving
 as
 they're
 moving


there.
 It's
 not
 like
 like
 deterministic


like
 we
 can
 see
 with
 the
 ball
 that
 we


throw
 around.
 When
 you
 get
 very
 very


small
 things
 get
 very
 fuzzy
 and
 it's


very
 hard.


>> So
 you
 hit
 upon
 upon
 the
 key
 idea
 here


maybe
 by
 accident
 but
 it's
 very


important.
 Quantum
 mechanics
 was


developed
 for
 the
 theory
 of
 small


things.
 You
 know,
 electrons,
 atoms,
 you


know,
 things
 things
 that
 are
 that
 are


the
 the
 fundamental
 constituents
 of
 it,


but
 very
 small.
 And
 um
 you
 know,
 if
 you


take
 an
 atom,
 it's
 made
 from
 electron


and
 a
 nucleus.
 You
 know,
 classically,


they
 attract
 each
 other
 and
 they
 would


just,
 you
 know,
 combine
 together
 and


then
 atoms
 basically
 would
 have
 no
 size.


Why
 do
 atoms
 have
 size?
 Okay,
 that
 you


know
 that
 that
 was
 one
 of
 the
 the


strange
 things
 and
 it's
 because
 this


atom
 is
 kind
 of
 not
 a
 a
 point
 particle.


I
 used
 to
 say
 to
 my
 kids
 that
 the


electrons
 were
 fuzzy.
 Okay.
 And
 and


quantum
 mechanically
 it
 has
 some
 wave


function
 and
 extended.
 You
 can
 think
 of


the
 electrons
 being
 all
 around
 the


nucleus
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 So
 um
 it
 it's


just
 a
 very
 strange
 behavior
 u
 but
 of


small
 things
 uh
 and
 of
 course
 very


important
 as
 how
 atoms
 work
 and
 how
 we


describe
 nature.
 So
 quantum
 mechanics


ultimately
 became
 a
 field
 that
 people


say
 is
 very
 non-intuitive
 in
 terms
 of


understanding
 where
 small
 small


particles
 are,
 the
 energy
 they
 have,


where
 they're
 moving
 to
 and
 and


basically
 we
 resolved
 to
 figuring
 out


that
 we
 had
 to
 use
 these
 functions.
 It's


not
 just
 a
 single
 point,
 but
 it's
 a


distribution.
 It's
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


places
 and
 there's
 a
 probability
 of


where
 the
 atom
 could
 be
 or
 where
 the


electron
 could
 be.
 It's
 also
 a


probability
 of
 how
 fast
 it
 might
 be


moving.
 All
 of
 these
 things
 become


probability
 functions.


>> And
 you
 develop
 a
 mathematical
 theory


for
 doing
 this
 that
 you
 know
 takes
 you


until
 your
 third
 year
 in
 university
 to


really
 know
 enough
 math
 to
 understand


that.
 But
 basically
 that's
 right


>> these
 are
 forming
 waves
 waves
 of
 the


electron.
 So
 you
 have
 kind
 of
 a
 wave
 and


electron
 around
 the
 nucleus
 describing


what
 the
 uh
 the
 electrons
 are.
 And
 these


are
 kind
 of
 like
 standing
 waves,
 you


know,
 it's
 like
 hitting
 a
 string.
 Uh,


you
 know,
 if if
 different
 length


strings,
 different
 tension
 strings
 form


different
 notes,
 these
 vibrations
 of
 the


electrons
 around
 the
 atom
 can
 vibrate
 at


different
 frequencies.


>> So
 rather
 than
 think
 about
 an
 electron


moving
 around
 an
 atom
 in
 a
 predescribed


path
 and
 I
 can
 know
 where
 it
 is
 at
 any


point
 in
 time,
 the
 right
 way
 to
 think


about
 an
 electron
 around
 an
 atom
 is
 it's


in
 a
 wave.
 It's
 a
 and
 it's
 it's
 a
 long


there's
 a
 wave
 that
 describes
 kind
 of


where
 it
 is
 and
 it's
 doing


>> and
 you
 have
 the
 electron
 and
 you
 have


the
 proton


attracting
 it.
 So
 the
 whole
 wave
 theory


combines
 all
 those
 two
 and
 you
 know


gives
 you
 a
 description
 of
 how
 the
 the


atom
 works
 and
 quite
 accurate


description
 too.
 And
 so
 one
 of
 the
 other


kind
 of
 features
 that
 arises
 from
 the


fact
 that
 everything
 at
 a
 micro
 scale
 is


described
 by
 wave
 functions
 is
 that


there's
 a
 small
 probability
 of
 something


kind
 of
 extreme
 or
 extraordinary


happening.
 Like
 the
 one
 example
 is


Stephen
 Hawking
 figured
 out
 that
 you


could
 have
 a
 particle
 and
 antiparticle


come
 out
 of
 nowhere
 in
 the
 middle
 of


space
 and
 the
 antiarticle
 goes
 into
 the


black
 hole.
 The
 particle
 shoots
 off.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that
 the
 probability
 of
 that


happening
 is
 so
 low,
 but
 it
 happens


enough
 that
 the
 antiparticle
 actually


starts
 to
 delete
 part
 of
 a
 black
 hole.


And
 that's
 how
 black
 holes
 evaporate
 and


this


>> theory
 all
 these
 interesting
 things.
 But


can
 you
 tell
 us
 how
 what
 quantum


tunneling
 is?
 So
 this
 is
 another
 one
 of


these
 sort
 of
 features
 of
 quantum


mechanics
 that
 arises
 from
 the
 fact
 that


these
 things
 are
 kind
 of
 waves
 and


probability
 functions.


>> Yeah.
 So
 if
 if
 you
 have
 um
 if
 you
 have


an
 electron
 just
 traveling
 through
 space


hitting
 hitting
 a
 wall
 let's
 say
 there's


a
 little
 wave
 wave
 packet
 wave
 function


to
 it.
 So
 it's
 not
 a
 single
 particle.
 It


has
 some
 extent
 to
 it.
 And
 what
 happens


is
 that
 when
 that
 particle
 hits
 the


wall,


quantum
 mechanics
 say
 there
 is
 some


amount
 small
 amount
 of
 this
 wave


function
 or
 if
 you
 like
 the
 particle


going
 through
 the
 wall
 and
 then
 to
 the


other
 side.


>> Now
 most
 of
 the
 time
 it
 uh
 it
 bounces


off
 but
 every
 once
 in
 a
 while
 it
 goes


through.
 And
 you
 know
 this
 is
 seen
 in
 um


uh
 everyday
 devices.
 This
 is
 not
 and
 as


if
 you
 build
 very
 small
 um
 memory


circuit
 you
 have
 to
 worry
 about


electrons
 tunneling
 and
 charge
 leaking


off
 your
 capacitor.
 Uh
 they
 have


magnetic
 memories
 that
 depend
 on
 these


tunnel
 junctions.
 So
 this
 is
 a
 very


well-known
 phenomenon
 and
 if
 you
 make


the
 this
 barrier
 this
 insulator
 just
 you


know
 10
 20
 atoms
 thick
 then
 that's
 thin


enough
 for
 it
 to
 go
 through


>> to
 go
 through.
 So
 this
 is
 what's
 so


interesting.
 Um
 you
 can
 actually
 predict


the
 number
 of
 electrons
 that
 might


tunnel
 through
 one
 of
 these
 barriers
 one


of
 these
 insulating
 barriers
 as
 they're


called
 over
 to
 the
 other
 side
 which


really
 is
 crazy
 to
 think
 about.
 It's


just
 like
 walking
 through
 walls,
 right?


I
 mean,


>> yeah,
 that's
 that's
 the
 idea.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 going
 back
 to
 the
 story
 you


were
 sharing,
 you're
 in
 grad
 school,


>> right?


>> And
 then
 Leot
 proposes
 this
 idea.
 Maybe


you
 can
 share
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 now
 that


we've
 got
 I
 think
 a
 bit
 of
 the
 basics
 on


what
 was
 discussed,
 which
 was


>> zooming
 out
 a
 bit
 like
 rather
 than
 just


think
 about
 all
 of
 this
 happening
 at
 a


microscopic
 scale,
 is
 it
 possible
 for
 it


to
 happen
 at
 a
 bigger
 scale?


>> Yeah.
 And
 again
 we've
 been
 talking
 about


quantum
 mechanics
 is
 the
 physics
 nature


at
 this
 microscopic
 atomic
 scale
 but
 the


question
 was
 if
 you
 made
 a
 macroscopic


object
 would
 it
 obey
 quantum
 mechanics


also
 okay
 and
 then
 you
 know
 that
 was
 the


basic
 question
 and
 it
 turns
 out
 that


there's
 a
 very
 natural
 system
 to
 look
 at


looking
 at
 an
 electrical
 system
 and
 look


seeing
 for
 quantum
 mechanics
 an


electrical
 system
 where
 the
 currents
 and


voltages
 of
 essentially
 electrical


oscillator
 does
 it
 behave
 like
 a


classical
 physics
 or
 does
 it
 behave
 with


this
 quantum
 mechanical
 nature
 to
 it?


And
 that
 was
 the
 question.
 Now
 it
 turns


out
 that
 when
 you
 think
 about
 quantum


mechanics
 and
 thinking
 about
 well


there's
 the
 quantum
 behavior
 but
 then
 at


some
 point
 you
 have
 to
 measure
 it
 which


then
 turns
 it
 into
 a
 probability.


There's
 something
 called
 the
 Schroinger


pat
 cat
 paradox
 where
 um
 in
 the
 paradox


you
 have
 your
 radioactive
 decay
 and
 then


you
 you
 you


let
 it
 happen
 for
 let's
 say
 half
 of
 the


radioactive
 decay
 time
 and
 then
 you
 say


and
 then
 the
 in
 you
 have
 a
 ready


detected
 decay
 a
 detector
 and
 then
 a


bottle
 of
 cyanide
 which
 will
 kill
 a
 cat


and
 then
 do
 you
 say
 you
 know
 after
 some


amount
 of
 time
 is
 the
 cat
 in
 the
 dead
 in


the
 live
 state.
 Okay.
 And
 you
 know,


physicists,
 you
 know,
 and
 this
 is
 this


good
 question.
 Einstein
 brought
 brought


it
 up
 or
 Shoner
 brought
 it
 up.
 A
 lot
 of


people
 uh
 discussed
 it.
 Uh
 but
 Alleged


pointed
 out
 that
 the
 reason
 this
 is
 a


paradox
 is
 you
 can
 believe
 that
 a


macroscopic
 object
 like
 a
 cat
 could
 be


in
 a
 quantum
 superposition
 state.
 And
 in


fact,
 there
 was
 no
 experime
 experimental


evidence
 that
 this
 could
 happen.
 And


that
 was
 his
 point.
 So
 um
 so
 he
 said


well
 you
 know
 people
 should
 be
 testing


this
 and
 let's
 see
 if
 it's
 true
 and
 uh


as
 a
 as
 a
 young
 graduate
 student
 who


just
 you
 know
 learned
 about
 quantum


mechanics
 and
 it's
 like
 oh
 that's
 a


really
 great
 great
 question
 that's


something
 that
 we
 should
 try
 to
 do
 and


we
 should
 try
 to
 do
 an
 experiment
 you


know
 on
 on
 the
 suggested
 system
 uh
 to


look
 for
 quantum
 mechanics.
 And
 the
 the


original
 proposal
 was
 looking
 for
 the


tunneling.
 Well,
 it
 turned
 out
 to
 be


more
 than
 that,
 but
 uh
 the
 it
 look
 for


tunneling.


>> Let
 me
 just
 kind
 of
 describe
 another
 way


is
 you
 know
 the
 macroscopic
 system
 could


be
 my
 entire
 body.
 Could
 I
 walk
 through


a
 wall?


>> That's
 right.
 And
 then
 the
 probability


of
 all
 of
 my
 atoms
 being
 in
 the
 perfect


moment,
 perfect
 position,
 you
 know,
 to


to
 be
 able
 to
 kind
 of
 cross
 through
 the


wall
 is
 so
 low,
 it
 would
 never
 happen
 in


this
 or
 many
 other
 universes
 of


>> and
 and
 that's
 the
 problem
 is
 that
 most


macroscopic
 objects
 when
 you
 try
 to


think
 about
 the
 quantum
 mechanics
 that


won't
 happen.
 Okay.
 So,


>> right.
 There's
 a
 small
 probability
 one


electron
 can
 cross
 over
 a
 barrier,


>> but
 the
 probability
 that
 many
 cross
 over


at
 once
 is
 lower
 and
 lower
 and
 lower
 and


that
 makes
 it
 very
 difficult
 to
 see
 at


scale.
 And
 what
 what
 happens
 is
 if
 you


look
 at
 an
 electrical
 circuit
 then
 the


parameters
 become
 favorable
 for
 seeing


this
 kind
 of
 macroscopic
 behavior.
 And


okay,
 it's
 hard
 to
 go
 into
 the
 the
 whole


physics
 of
 all
 that,
 but
 it's
 basically


because
 you
 can
 make
 a
 circuit
 that


operates
 at
 microwave
 frequencies.
 So


instead
 of
 you
 trying
 to
 go
 through
 the


wall
 once
 a
 second,
 it
 tries
 to
 go


through
 the
 wall
 five
 billion
 times
 a


second.
 Okay.
 So
 then
 it's
 it's
 a
 lot,


you
 know,
 more
 you
 know,
 you
 have
 more


chances
 to
 go
 through.
 And
 uh
 uh
 the


other
 thing
 is
 the
 just
 the
 various


parameters
 that
 involved
 in
 quantum


mechanics
 you
 know
 are
 favorable
 for


seeing
 this
 kind
 of
 phenomena.
 You
 have


to
 do
 the
 experiment
 right
 but
 uh
 it's


favorable
 for
 doing
 that.


>> So
 one
 of
 the
 parts
 of
 your
 experiment


you
 created
 what's
 called
 a
 Josephson


junction.
 Is
 that
 is
 that
 correct?
 So


this
 is
 two
 superconductors
 with
 a


barrier
 between
 them.
 Right.
 I
 got


really
 fascinated
 by
 superconductors


when
 I
 was
 maybe
 12
 years
 old.
 I
 I
 went


and
 bought
 a
 superc
 conducting
 disc
 etum


berium
 copper
 oxide.
 Yes,
 that's
 right.


>> From
 the
 back
 of
 Popular
 Science
 and


then
 I
 went
 to
 UCLA
 and
 I
 got
 a
 a
 jug
 of


liquid
 nitrogen


>> and
 then
 I
 floated
 a
 magnet
 above
 the


disc


>> because
 of
 the
 Meisner
 effect
 and
 I
 had


it
 at
 the
 science
 fair
 and
 I
 and
 I
 did


very
 well
 with
 the
 science
 fair
 that


year
 because
 I
 showed
 this
 really


>> What
 year
 was
 that?
 Was
 that
 when
 it
 was


discovered?


>> Must
 have
 been
 919.


>> Okay.
 Yeah,
 that
 was
 close
 enough
 that


that
 was
 good.
 Yeah,
 the
 hard
 part
 is


getting
 the
 liquid
 nitrogen.
 But


>> yeah,
 and
 I
 had
 a
 friend
 whose
 dad
 was


like
 a
 doctor
 at
 UCLA
 or
 something
 like


that,
 so
 he
 was
 able
 to
 get
 the
 liquid


nitrogen
 for
 our
 demonstration.


>> Right.
 Yeah,
 that
 that
 was
 the
 hard


part.
 Okay.


>> I've
 always
 been
 fascinated
 by
 the


physics
 of
 superconductors
 and
 maybe
 you


can
 just
 explain
 one
 of
 these
 important


features
 of
 the
 of
 superconductors
 as
 it


relates
 to
 kind
 of
 resistance
 and


current
 flow
 and
 then
 we
 can
 talk
 about


your
 experiment.


So,
 so
 what
 happens
 is
 um
 when
 a
 a


material
 goes
 superconducting


all
 the
 electrons
 condense
 into
 one


state.
 Okay.
 Now
 to
 just
 to
 give
 you


analogy
 of
 how
 it's
 not
 perfect
 analogy


it's
 close
 analogy.
 If
 you
 have
 a
 normal


metal
 any
 metal
 we
 have
 at
 room


temperature
 it's
 like
 a
 gas
 of


electrons.
 It's
 like
 you
 know
 gas
 in
 the


air.
 And
 then
 when
 you
 get
 below
 the


superconducting
 temperature.


>> Sorry,
 I
 think
 we
 should
 just
 explain


that.
 So,
 so
 you
 have
 a
 metal
 all
 the


electrons
 are
 kind
 of
 moving
 around.


They're
 they're
 perturbed.
 They're
 all


different
 energies,
 different
 states.


That's
 right.
 Different
 energies,


different
 states.
 You
 know,
 there's
 some


firm
 statistics.
 Not
 go
 into
 that,
 but


it's
 more
 or
 less
 looks
 like
 a
 gas.
 You


think
 of
 a
 of
 a
 gas
 and
 then
 when
 you


cool
 it
 below
 you
 know
 a
 certain


temperature
 it
 then
 coaleses
 into
 let's


say
 a
 solid
 like
 like
 atoms
 will
 and
 the


electrons
 coales
 into
 the
 something


cooper
 cooper
 pair
 bcs
 condenset
 is
 the


name
 where
 all
 the
 electrons
 are
 kind
 of


locked
 together
 and
 doing
 the
 same


thing.
 Now
 the
 nice
 thing
 about
 that


it's
 not
 like
 they're
 frozen
 in
 place


but
 they
 have
 a
 free
 parameter
 that


allows
 them
 all
 the
 currents
 all
 the


electrons
 to
 flow
 in
 some
 direction


which
 is
 the
 supercurren


>> in
 a
 superconductor
 meaning
 a
 material


that's
 cool
 enough
 that
 it
 reaches
 its


superconducting
 critical
 temperature.


Right?
 So
 suddenly
 all
 the
 electrons
 can


still
 move.
 They
 can
 still
 create
 a


current,
 but


>> but
 they're
 they're
 moving
 together
 like


they're
 in
 like
 in
 my
 analogy
 like


they're
 in
 a
 solid
 instead
 of
 the
 gas.


>> And
 because
 they're
 moving
 together,


>> okay,
 then
 then
 when
 you
 work
 through


all
 the
 physics,
 they
 are
 not
 um
 you


know,
 they
 aren't
 randomly
 scattering


off
 things.
 They're
 just
 moving


together.
 And
 then
 you
 get
 a
 supercurren


where
 for
 example
 if
 you
 made
 a
 ring
 a


superconductor
 superconductor
 that


current
 would
 basically
 flow
 for
 forever


around
 the
 ring.
 This
 is
 what
 you
 saw


with
 the
 floating
 magnet.


>> Right.
 That's
 so
 interesting.
 I've


always
 uh
 thought
 and
 there's
 obviously


been
 companies
 started
 around
 the
 idea


of
 creating
 an
 infinite
 battery
 where


you
 could
 store
 technically
 forever


electricity
 because
 the
 electrons
 are


just
 moving
 around.
 If
 it's


superconducting
 it
 can
 they
 can
 just


spin
 forever
 around
 that
 circuit.
 And


people
 actually
 do
 use
 big


superconducting
 magnets
 to
 store
 energy.


And
 when
 you
 get
 an
 MRI
 that
 you're
 in
 a


you're
 in
 a
 liquid
 helium
 machine
 with
 a


a
 superconducting
 magnet,
 they
 charge
 it


up
 and
 that
 magnetic
 field
 is
 basically


there
 forever.
 Uh
 you
 know,
 waiting
 for


people
 to
 to
 go
 inside
 it.
 It
 it's
 kind


of
 strange
 to
 be
 in
 you're
 inside
 this


super
 cold
 magnet
 there.
 But
 they've


designed
 it
 very
 well.
 Works
 well.
 So


this
 Josephson
 junction
 is
 two


superconductors.
 They're
 on
 either
 side


of
 a
 barrier
 that
 you
 create,
 an


insulating
 barrier.
 And
 then
 maybe
 just


explain
 the
 experiment
 and
 and
 what
 you


guys
 measured.


>> And
 this
 this
 was
 all
 while
 you
 were
 in


grad
 school,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 and
 uh
 and
 this
 is
 this


Jose
 junction
 because
 the
 Cooper
 pairs


have
 to
 tunnel
 through
 it,
 but
 they
 kind


of
 tunnel
 through
 it
 together
 without


any
 loss.
 This
 this
 actually
 forms


what's
 called
 an
 electrical
 inductor
 in


circuit
 in
 circuits.
 So
 an
 inductor
 is


normally
 a
 a
 coil
 of
 wire
 that
 stores


energy
 and
 its
 magnetic
 field.
 Here
 this


this
 just
 stores
 energy
 of
 the
 electrons


tunneling
 through
 here.
 And
 so
 it's
 a


it's
 something
 called
 we
 call
 a
 kinetic


inductance
 and
 it
 happens
 with
 this
 but


that
 forms
 a
 nonlinear
 inductance
 and


with
 a
 capacitor
 in
 the
 circuit
 that


forms
 an
 inductor
 capacitance
 resonance


circuit
 which
 is
 in
 your
 old
 which
 is


like
 in
 your
 radios
 you
 have
 filters
 of


LC
 resonance
 circuits
 to
 filter
 your


signal
 and
 do
 anything.
 So
 this
 is
 a


very
 common
 microwave
 and
 uh
 you
 know


radio
 frequency
 uh
 element
 that
 you
 use


all
 the
 time
 to
 make
 electrical


circuits.


>> So
 I
 just
 want
 to
 simplify
 that
 you
 have


these
 two
 superconductors
 split
 by
 this


barrier.
 There's
 some
 tunneling
 some
 of


these
 electrons
 are
 actually
 going


through
 the
 barrier
 to
 the
 other
 side


and
 then
 you
 can
 effectively
 measure
 all


of
 these
 different
 changes
 as
 you
 change


the
 temperature.
 You
 guys
 were
 putting


different
 voltage
 states
 into
 this


circuit
 that
 you
 built.
 And
 what
 you
 saw


and
 what
 you
 measured
 and
 what
 you


demonstrated
 was
 that
 there
 were
 these


very
 kind
 of
 discrete
 or
 specific


changes
 that
 happened
 that
 basically


demonstrated
 quantum
 mechanics
 at
 scale.


>> That's
 right.
 So,
 so
 this
 inductor


capacitor
 resonator
 which
 you
 just
 treat


as
 a
 you
 is
 a
 charge
 and
 a
 current
 going


through
 but
 because
 it's
 quantum


mechanics
 there's
 this
 wave
 function
 to


it.
 So
 there's
 some
 uncertainty
 in
 these


and
 then
 given
 just
 the
 way
 that
 the


simple
 electrical
 circuit
 works
 um
 uh


you
 can
 then
 demonstrate
 the
 quantum


mechanics
 one
 of
 the
 tunneling
 which
 is


a
 little
 bit
 hard
 to
 describe
 here
 but


you
 can
 see
 tunneling
 but
 I
 think
 the


little
 bit
 easier
 thing
 maybe
 easier
 is


to
 look
 at
 the
 energy
 levels
 of
 this
 and


let
 me
 kind
 of
 explain
 that
 when
 people


discovered
 you
 know
 atomic
 physics
 and


started
 doing
 any
 doing
 this
 they
 um


excited
 a
 gas
 of
 of
 you
 know
 some
 gas


and
 the
 light
 coming
 out
 of
 that
 gas


would
 be
 at
 certain
 colors
 of
 frequency.


So
 if
 you
 go
 outside
 and
 you
 have
 the


sodium
 lamps
 on,
 these
 are
 kind
 of
 the


yellow
 lamps,
 you
 have,
 you
 know,
 kind


of
 a
 single
 frequency
 coming
 out
 of
 that


lamp.
 Or
 nowadays
 you
 look
 at
 LEDs,


there
 are
 certain
 frequencies
 that
 come


out
 of
 that.
 And
 this
 is
 a
 quantum


mechanical
 effect
 that
 the
 how
 the


electrons
 travel
 around
 the
 atom.


There's
 only
 certain
 kind
 of
 frequencies


that
 they
 oscillate
 at.
 Now,


classically,
 you
 would
 expect
 there
 to


be
 all
 different
 frequencies
 that
 it


spirals
 around
 or
 spirals
 into
 the


nucleus.
 So,
 that's
 what
 you
 expect.
 But


we
 saw
 these
 discrete
 frequencies.


>> And
 so,
 by
 measuring
 those
 discrete


frequencies,
 you
 now
 had
 proof


>> that
 there
 was
 quantum
 mechanics


happening
 at
 a
 macro
 scale.


>> That
 That's
 right.


>> And
 you
 published
 this
 work.
 And
 was


there
 a
 lot
 of
 attention
 when
 you


published
 this
 work?


This
 was
 in
 1985
 86.


>> Yeah.
 85
 or
 I
 actually
 forget
 but
 85
 or


86.


>> And
 so
 was
 there
 much
 attention
 on
 this


work
 at
 the
 time?
 8.
 Yeah.
 This
 was
 a


big
 question
 and
 people
 wanted
 to
 you


know
 understand
 that
 and
 you
 know
 we


published
 it
 in
 physical
 review
 letters


and
 it
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 attention
 and
 I


think
 we
 had
 a
 little
 article
 in


Scientific
 American
 that
 was
 very
 proud


of


>> that
 wrote
 about
 that
 and
 uh
 yeah
 it
 it


was
 you
 know
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 kind
 of
 a


big
 deal.


>> What
 did
 you
 go
 on
 to
 do
 at
 that
 point?


Was
 it
 considered
 groundbreaking
 Nobel


Prize-winning
 work
 and
 what
 was
 the


story
 at
 that
 time
 when
 this
 came
 out?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 you
 know,
 it
 was
 an
 it
 was
 an


important
 piece
 of
 work
 and
 people


noticed
 it,
 but
 you
 know,
 it
 it
 you


know,
 we
 we
 showed
 that
 quantum


mechanics
 worked
 and
 quantum
 mechanics


worked
 on
 the
 macro
 scale,
 which
 was


nice,
 but
 one
 could
 still,
 you
 know,


argue,
 well,
 what
 is
 it
 good
 for?
 What


are
 you
 going
 to
 do?
 And
 the
 in
 fact
 the


secret
 of
 an
 important
 scientific


breakthrough


is
 does
 it
 lead
 to
 other
 experiments
 and


other
 papers
 and
 other
 inventions
 and


the
 like
 and
 uh
 that
 kind
 of
 took
 uh
 you


know
 many
 decades
 to
 happen
 because
 it


was
 so
 new
 and
 people
 had
 to
 do
 do
 that.


So
 I
 would
 say
 it
 was
 noteworthy
 at
 the


time
 but
 you
 know
 not
 necessarily
 you


know
 something
 for
 a
 Nobel
 Prize
 because


it
 was
 just
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 weird
 and


went
 off
 and
 you
 know
 what
 are
 you
 going


to
 do
 with
 it?


>> But
 what
 happened
 at
 the
 time
 was
 very


interesting
 and
 at
 the
 end
 of
 my
 thesis


time
 there
 was
 a
 conference
 in
 uh
 UC


Santa
 Barbara
 where
 I
 came
 here
 for
 the


first
 time.


>> Yeah.
 and
 uh
 they
 they
 were
 talking


about
 this
 experiment
 but
 the
 very
 last


day
 the
 last
 talk
 was
 by
 Richard
 Feman


very
 well-known
 physicist


>> of
 course
 the
 greatest
 yeah


>> the
 great
 yeah
 right
 you
 know
 I
 kind
 of


idolized
 him
 and
 and
 read
 his
 his
 his


books
 and
 whatever


>> and
 he
 was
 talking
 about
 using
 quantum


mechanics
 for
 computation
 which
 is


building
 a
 quantum
 computer


>> so
 he
 gave
 a
 talk
 that
 was,
 you
 know,


really
 kind
 of
 amazing.
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


honest
 as
 a
 student.
 I
 I
 didn't
 quite


catch
 everything
 and
 my
 Michelle
 dev
 my


dear
 friend
 said
 yeah
 maybe
 some
 of
 the


things
 wasn't
 quite
 figured
 out
 at
 the


time
 but
 afterwards
 he
 was
 absolutely


mobbed
 by
 people
 asking
 him
 questions


cuz
 it's
 so
 interesting
 to
 think
 about


taking
 this
 this
 you
 know
 basic
 law
 and


actually
 doing
 computation
 with
 it


>> right


>> and
 I
 was
 a
 graduate
 student
 so
 I
 was


kind
 of
 at
 the
 outside
 ring
 you
 know
 you


have
 the
 professor
 professors
 in
 close


and
 whatever
 and
 I
 was
 just
 a
 lowly


graduate
 student
 so
 I
 could
 hear
 a


little
 bit
 but
 what
 I
 what
 I
 learned


from
 this
 it
 was
 a
 great
 question
 and


and
 something
 that
 would
 be
 kind
 of


worth
 doing
 you
 know
 for
 your
 your
 life


pro
 your
 life
 work
 because
 it's
 so
 deep


and
 so
 interesting
 and
 maybe
 practical


and
 the
 like
 so
 that
 really
 motivated
 me


>> yeah
 so
 that
 big
 idea
 is
 to
 use
 quantum


mechanics
 and
 these
 properties
 of


quantum
 mechanics
 to
 do
 computing.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 right.
 And
 and
 I
 would
 say


uh
 uh
 soon
 after
 that
 other
 people
 in


the
 field
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 specific


and
 showed
 how
 you
 would
 how
 you
 would


do
 it.
 And
 then
 it
 was
 in
 the
 early


1990s,
 maybe
 5
 years
 later,
 that
 Peter


Shaw
 came
 up
 with
 this
 factoring


algorithm
 to
 to
 solve
 a
 you
 know,
 a
 real


world
 problem
 with
 it.


>> Yeah.
 And
 it
 took
 a
 while
 to
 people


figure
 out.
 It
 was
 very
 abstract
 and
 you


know
 people
 quite
 weren't
 sure
 what
 to


do.
 But
 but
 like
 I
 said
 I
 could
 see
 that


in
 all
 the
 the
 crowd
 around
 Fineman


asking
 them
 questions
 that
 this
 was
 the


most
 you
 know
 most
 interesting


fundamental
 question
 you
 know
 how
 to


combine
 quantum
 mechanics
 with
 doing


computation.
 It's
 it's
 really
 amazing.


>> And
 so
 you
 started
 to
 do
 that
 with
 your


life's
 work
 pretty
 much.
 you
 go
 on
 to
 a


very
 good
 career.


>> Yeah.
 So
 my
 career
 path
 um
 was
 of
 course


quantum
 computing
 was
 getting
 developed


and
 and
 it
 took
 me
 a
 while
 to
 really
 get


go
 all
 in
 on
 it.
 Okay.


>> Yeah.
 So
 um
 what
 happened
 is
 Michelle


Devare
 was
 was
 from
 France
 from
 CA


France
 went
 to
 Berkeley
 went
 back
 I
 went


there
 as
 a
 posttock
 and
 worked
 with
 them


and
 they
 were
 young
 and
 unknown
 at
 the


time
 and
 people
 like
 well
 you're
 going


to
 go
 to
 Europe
 and
 you're
 not
 going
 to


get
 connected
 to
 US
 science
 but
 I
 knew


Michelle
 and
 Danielle
 Eststev
 and


Christian
 Abino
 the
 people
 I
 working


with
 were
 absolutely
 brilliant
 okay
 and


they've
 had
 a
 very
 illustrious
 a
 career.


So
 I
 went
 over
 there
 because
 I
 knew
 that


was
 great.
 And
 we
 continued
 to
 do


experiments
 on
 this.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 then
 after
 that
 I
 came
 back
 to
 the


US
 and
 I
 worked
 for
 the
 National


Institute
 of
 Standards
 and
 Technology.


And
 it
 turns
 out
 just
 down
 the
 hall
 from


Dave
 Wland
 and
 his
 group
 who
 went
 a


Nobel
 Prize
 for
 atomic
 physics
 for
 you


know
 doing
 quantum
 computation.
 And
 I


worked
 on
 some
 with
 doing
 experiments
 on


counting
 electrons
 and
 working
 for


metrology
 and
 then
 did
 other


experiments.
 And
 then
 in
 late
 uh
 the
 '9s


I
 I
 just
 again
 went
 all
 in
 on
 building
 a


quantum
 computer.
 There
 was
 funding


available
 at
 that
 time.
 It
 had


progressed
 enough
 theoretically
 that
 the


US
 government
 started
 you
 know
 funding


this
 to
 see
 if
 people
 can
 do
 it.
 And
 so


then
 couple
 years
 after
 2014
 I
 think
 you


ended
 up
 at
 at
 Google's
 quantum
 lab
 in


Santa
 Barbara.
 Is
 that
 right?


>> I
 was
 at
 UCSB
 for
 um
 10
 years
 or
 so


which
 was
 wonderful
 and
 built
 up
 the
 lab


to
 go
 from
 very
 basic
 things
 to
 building


a
 five
 and
 then
 9
 cubit
 quantum


computer.
 And
 then
 during
 that
 time,


Google
 got
 interested
 and
 I
 I
 kind
 of


decided
 that
 although
 academia
 was


great,
 it
 would
 be
 hard
 to
 get
 the
 team


together
 and
 keep
 them
 together
 for
 a


long
 time
 to
 build
 this
 complicated


machine
 and
 Google
 had
 the
 money.
 Okay.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 so
 we
 went
 there
 and
 we


started
 off
 fairly
 small
 uh
 mostly
 from


people
 coming
 from
 my
 UCSB
 group
 and


then
 in
 uh
 2019


we
 published
 this
 quantum
 supremacy


experiment
 with
 53
 cubits
 where
 we
 made


a
 lot
 of
 cubits
 and
 we
 made
 them
 really


good
 and
 you
 know
 fast
 and
 whatever
 so


that
 we
 could
 run
 some
 algorithm
 a


mathematical
 algorithm
 that
 um
 what
 it


produced
 some
 output
 uh
 that
 was
 took


you
 know
 much
 much
 longer
 on
 a
 classical


computer
 to
 to
 emulate
 and
 do
 that.
 It


was
 not
 practical
 but
 it
 was
 a


demonstration
 of
 the
 power
 of
 a
 quantum


computer


>> that
 it
 worked.
 Well,
 just
 maybe
 give


your
 description
 of
 a
 cubit
 and
 maybe
 we


can
 relate,
 you
 know,
 how
 do
 we
 build


these
 quantum
 computers
 from
 cubits
 to


the
 Josephson
 junction
 and
 some
 of
 the


early
 work
 you
 had
 done
 that
 you
 ended


up
 winning
 the
 prize
 for.


>> So
 very
 simply,
 we
 have
 a
 metal
 wire
 and


a
 metal
 wire
 that
 gets
 put
 together
 on


this
 Joseen
 junction
 which
 represents
 a


a
 an
 inductor
 flowing
 through
 here.
 And


then
 from
 this
 wire
 to
 this
 wire,
 we


have
 a
 capacitor.


And
 then
 we
 set
 that
 up
 to
 oscillate
 at


about
 5
 GHz
 cell
 phone
 frequencies.


Uh
 uh
 you
 know
 to
 to
 form
 the
 cubit.


Okay,
 this
 oscillating
 thing.
 And
 then


there's
 at
 low
 temperatures


superconductors
 you
 know
 all
 this
 magic


we
 can
 we
 can
 get
 quantum
 mechanical


behavior
 out
 of
 that


>> and
 then
 you
 can
 measure
 that
 quantum


mechanical
 behavior
 create
 a


representation
 and
 use
 that
 to
 run
 your


computing.


>> That's
 right.
 What
 you
 can
 do
 is
 you
 put


on
 microwave
 pulses
 to
 change
 the
 state


of
 the
 quantum
 computer,
 change
 the
 way


it
 oscillates
 and
 then
 we
 connect
 it
 to


um
 it's
 a
 complicated
 readout
 circuitry


uh
 to
 you
 know
 in
 the
 end
 figure
 out


what
 state
 it's
 in.


>> Okay.
 And
 then
 and
 then
 you
 you
 connect


just
 an
 array
 of
 these
 and
 you
 just
 use


capacitive
 coupling
 from
 you
 know
 one


one
 wire
 to
 the
 to
 the
 next
 one
 to
 to


couple
 them
 together
 and
 it's
 more


complicated
 than
 that
 but
 that
 gives
 you


a
 good
 idea


>> and
 then
 just
 to
 understand


your
 work
 that
 you
 won
 this
 Nobel
 Prize


for
 that
 demonstrated
 this
 quantum


mechanical
 phenomena
 at
 scale.
 Is
 that


part
 of
 the
 design
 of
 a
 cubit
 and
 the


circuitry?
 Did
 that
 inform
 that
 design


work
 or
 explain
 it
 rather?
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 It
 was
 the
 very
 basic
 simplest


circuit.
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 were
 using


analog
 simulators
 at
 the
 time
 not
 even


the
 I
 took
 data
 with
 a
 computer
 but
 this


is
 this
 is
 far
 back
 enough
 that
 you
 know


it
 was
 very
 rudimentary


>> and
 then
 over
 the
 years
 we
 just
 got
 more


sophisticated
 design
 by
 the
 whole
 field


you
 know
 many
 many
 people


>> and
 uh
 and
 we
 were
 able
 to
 put
 things


together
 in
 a
 way
 to
 actually
 build
 a


computer
 now


>> right


>> the
 the
 I
 would
 say
 the
 reason
 why
 It's


interesting
 from
 the
 Nobel
 Prize
 thing


is
 what
 it
 led
 to
 and
 what
 it
 led
 to


right
 now
 is
 a
 thousand
 maybe
 several


thousand
 people
 around
 the
 world
 doing


research
 to
 build
 this
 superconducting


quantum
 computer
 and
 and
 it's
 just


turned
 into
 enormous
 field
 large
 number


of
 papers
 large
 number
 of
 people
 people


selling
 quantum
 computers
 IBM
 is
 selling


quantum
 computers
 people
 are
 selling


time
 in
 the
 quantum
 computers
 and
 the


fact
 that
 it
 was
 a
 it
 was
 a
 useful
 idea


okay
 that
 led
 and
 and
 and
 brought
 into


form
 uh
 uh
 all
 all
 these
 different


experiments
 ideas
 and
 many
 many
 people


contributed
 this


>> I
 mean
 it's
 very
 interesting
 and
 I
 think


just
 this
 broad
 question
 or
 observation


that
 sometimes


inquisitive
 minds


leads
 to
 research
 that
 leads
 to
 some
 set


of
 discovery
 that
 are
 completely
 not


apparent
 until
 40
 years
 later.
 the


effect
 or
 the
 impact
 it
 may
 have
 had


>> on
 building
 an
 industrial
 field
 like


there's
 now
 quantum
 computing
 everyone


feels
 is
 on
 the
 brink


>> of
 actually
 achieving
 what
 people
 have


talked
 about
 in
 theory
 for
 decades
 but


seems
 to
 be
 getting
 very
 close
 to
 doing


it
 and


>> yeah
 I
 I
 can
 talk
 on
 that
 but
 I
 would


say
 um
 you
 know
 this
 field
 many
 other


ideas
 on
 how
 to
 build
 a
 quantum
 computer


has
 been
 generated
 and
 uh
 it
 is
 very


exciting
 field
 quite
 large
 field
 and
 I


would
 say
 that
 the
 science
 was
 very
 very


deep
 too.
 To
 get
 these
 things
 to
 work


you
 have
 to
 invent
 lots
 of
 different


devices.
 You
 have
 to
 think
 about


materials.
 You
 have
 to
 fabricate
 it,


build
 complex
 control
 systems.


Engineering
 and
 physics
 is
 is
 to
 me


quite
 beautiful.
 And
 and
 just
 to
 tell


you
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 me,
 um
 you
 know,


I
 grew
 up
 building
 things
 and
 as
 an


experimentalist,


you
 know,
 I
 like
 to
 to
 build


instruments,
 you
 know,
 build
 experiments


to
 show
 this.
 And
 this
 was
 kind
 of
 the


ideal
 project
 for
 me
 because,
 you
 know,


from
 very
 early
 on
 it
 was
 like,
 well,


let's,
 you
 know,
 do
 this
 great
 physics,


but
 let's
 also
 build
 something.
 And
 by


saying,
 well,
 what
 do
 we
 have
 to
 do
 to


build
 a
 quantum
 computer?
 that
 kind
 of


led
 me
 to
 know
 what
 physics
 we
 have
 to


test
 and
 what
 are
 the
 kinds
 of
 things
 we


have
 to
 build
 and
 that's
 just
 the
 way
 my


mind
 works.
 I'm
 I'm
 much
 more


practically
 oriented.
 So
 it
 was
 a


perfect
 field
 for
 me
 to
 get
 in
 and


that's
 kind
 of
 what
 you
 know
 intuitively


led
 me
 to
 you
 know
 want
 to
 do
 this
 in


graduate
 school.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 just


so
 fascinating
 the
 amount
 of
 engineering


and
 technology
 you
 have
 to
 do
 to
 make


this
 work.


>> Where
 are
 we
 in
 quantum
 computing


evolution
 today?
 So
 what's
 the
 state?
 At


what
 point
 will
 we
 have
 call
 it


generally
 accessible
 and
 generally


useful
 quantum
 computers
 that
 can
 do
 all


of
 the
 amazing
 things
 everyone's
 kind
 of


talked
 about
 for
 decades
 that
 one
 would


be
 able
 to
 do
 quantum
 computers.


>> That's
 right.
 So
 um
 right
 now
 we're


we're
 about
 50
 or
 100
 cubits
 for
 the


superconducting
 case
 but
 they
 they
 can


be
 fully
 controlled
 and
 run
 real


algorithms
 and
 do
 very
 complicated


things.
 They
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 systems


that
 can
 do
 that.
 I
 think
 the
 the


newcomer
 on
 the
 block
 which
 looks
 good


is
 neutral
 atoms
 where
 they've
 made
 big


neutral
 atom
 systems
 but
 they
 they're


still
 working
 to
 get
 the
 gates


controlled
 really
 well
 and
 the
 like.
 But


what's
 happened
 right
 now
 is
 we
 can
 run


genuine
 algorithms
 on
 that
 and
 people


have
 uh
 h
 you
 know
 have
 ideas
 they
 want


to
 run
 but
 because
 these
 cubits
 are
 not


perfect
 okay
 you
 it's
 an
 analog
 control


system
 and
 fundamentally
 these
 quantum


bits
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 error
 to
 it


little
 bit
 of
 noise
 to
 it
 you
 can
 only


run
 so
 complicated
 of
 a
 project
 and
 it's


good
 enough
 to
 write
 scientific
 papers


and
 try
 things
 out.
 Uh,
 every
 once
 in
 a


while
 people
 say
 they've
 done
 something


uh,
 you
 know,
 that's
 hard
 to
 compute
 and


well
 that's
 fine,
 but
 they
 aren't
 really


big
 enough
 to
 be
 useful
 yet.
 They
 have


to
 get
 bigger
 and
 they
 have
 to
 get


better,
 less
 noise.


>> Do
 you
 have
 a
 point
 of
 view
 on
 the


timelines?
 This
 is
 everyone's


speculation
 and
 there's
 been
 more
 hype


than
 reality.


>> Yeah,
 there's
 more
 hype
 than
 reality
 and


and
 uh,
 and
 it's
 hard.
 I
 used
 to
 not


want
 to
 speculate
 that
 but
 since
 I


started
 a
 company
 then
 I
 can
 do
 that
 and


what
 we
 want
 to
 do
 and
 it's
 a
 timeline


of
 many
 other
 groups
 is
 to
 do
 something


in
 let's
 say
 in
 the
 next
 8
 10
 years


something
 like
 that
 but
 the
 problem
 is


you
 know
 people
 are
 predicting
 10
 years


you
 know
 for
 a
 while
 now
 so
 okay
 we
 we


have
 to
 do
 that
 but
 um
 I
 can
 tell
 you


for
 what
 we're
 doing
 is
 that
 we've


identified
 by
 what
 are
 kind
 of
 the


technology
 bottlenecks
 of
 the
 current


fabric
 turn
 ways
 to
 make
 a
 a
 quantum


computer.
 We've
 written
 some
 papers
 on


it
 and
 you
 know
 we're
 working
 with


people
 in
 the
 semiconductor
 industry
 to


manufacture
 this
 in
 a
 much
 more
 coste


effective
 quality
 way
 you
 know
 the
 way


you
 make
 these
 GPUs
 or
 something
 and
 we


think
 uh
 you
 know
 when
 we
 get
 that
 to


work
 we
 can
 scale
 up
 very
 rapidly
 so
 in


in
 a
 let's
 say
 10year
 time
 scale


something
 like
 that


>> in
 a
 lot
 of
 technically
 difficult
 fields


like
 fusion
 energy
 perhaps
 even
 quantum


computing.
 They
 are
 seeing
 profound


acceleration


in
 getting
 to
 their
 crazy
 big
 goals
 on


these
 very
 big
 technical
 projects


because
 of
 AI.
 Is
 AI
 starting
 to
 play
 a


role
 in
 solving
 some
 of
 the
 engineering,


material
 science,
 scaling,
 noise
 issues


that
 we've
 seen
 historically
 in
 quantum


computing?
 And
 do
 you
 think
 that
 there's


an
 acceleration
 underway
 in
 performance


improvements
 because
 of
 AI?
 there
 there


may
 be
 um
 my
 partic
 and and
 and
 there's


things
 we
 can
 maybe
 do
 modeling
 and
 the


like.
 We
 also
 think
 what
 we
 can
 do
 is


use
 the
 quantum
 computer
 and
 AI
 together


to
 solve
 the
 problems
 better.
 So
 that


that
 that's
 what
 our
 theory
 team
 is


proposing.
 I
 used
 to
 work
 with
 Google


quantum
 AI.
 That's
 what
 they're


proposing.
 So
 there's
 a
 general
 feeling


of
 that.
 My
 particular
 view
 though
 is


that
 in
 terms
 of
 this
 control,
 if
 you


don't
 build
 your
 system
 cleanly
 enough


and
 you
 know
 that
 the
 control
 is
 clear


enough,
 uh
 you're
 you're
 not
 going
 to


get
 the
 the
 great
 performance
 out
 of
 it.


So
 I'm
 a
 little
 bit
 old
 school
 here
 and


and
 working
 on
 you
 know
 building
 it
 that


way.
 There's
 certainly
 some
 elements


where
 you
 can
 use
 AI,


you
 know,
 in
 the
 decoding
 circuit
 for


the
 the
 error
 correction
 and
 the
 like.


But
 the
 one
 thing
 to
 mention
 to
 you
 is


that,
 you
 know,
 these
 cubits
 are
 are


naturally
 very
 noisy
 and
 you
 can
 maybe


do
 sometimes
 100
 for
 bad
 cubits
 and


maybe
 a
 thousand
 maybe
 few
 thousand


operations
 before
 they
 kind
 of
 lose


their
 memory.
 You
 know,
 you
 can
 think
 of


it
 as
 like
 dynamic
 RAM
 where
 you
 have
 to


refresh
 it.
 Well,
 you
 have
 to
 refresh
 it


with
 error
 correction.
 And
 because
 of


that,
 you're
 talking
 about
 a
 million


cubit
 quantum
 computers
 to
 be
 general


purpose
 and
 solve
 really
 hard
 problems.


There
 might
 be
 some


>> a
 million
 something.
 A
 million
 is
 a
 good


round
 number
 for
 it.
 Maybe
 a
 little
 bit


more.
 And
 right
 now
 we're
 at
 you
 know
 a


hundred
 or
 you
 know
 a
 little
 bit
 more


than
 that.
 So
 we
 have
 a
 ways
 to
 go.


What
 is
 your
 view
 on
 China
 and
 the


progress
 that
 they're
 making
 in
 this


technology
 versus
 the
 US?
 This
 is
 the


topic
 dour
 in
 every
 field,
 industrial


field,
 computing,
 science
 is
 where's


China
 at
 compared
 to
 the
 US,
 the


comparisons
 and
 everyone's
 worried
 about


the
 progress
 in
 China
 versus
 the
 US
 and


what
 that
 means.
 So
 I
 can
 talk
 about
 my


own
 field
 but
 when
 I
 have
 read
 the


papers
 that
 um
 duplicated
 what
 we
 did
 at


at
 Google
 on
 the
 quantum
 supremacy


experiment
 you
 know
 they
 know
 what


they're
 doing.
 I
 mean
 they
 they
 go


through
 the
 theory
 they
 talk
 about
 a
 lot


of
 it
 is
 very
 similar
 to
 what
 we're


doing
 but
 they
 know
 what
 they're
 doing


and
 they're
 getting
 great
 results.
 And


the
 thing
 that
 scares
 me
 a
 little
 bit


is,
 you
 know,
 last
 December
 the
 Google


group
 published
 the
 latest
 results,


which
 is
 really
 much
 nicer.
 They
 made


some
 real
 improvement,
 but
 then
 China


soon
 afterward
 published
 something
 kind


of
 indicating
 they
 were,
 you
 know,
 on


par
 or
 near
 par
 or
 something
 to
 it.
 And,


you
 know,
 I'm
 worried
 that
 the
 the


Chinese
 government
 is
 saying,
 well,
 you


can't
 publish
 anything
 until
 it's
 in
 the


Western
 press.
 and
 then
 you
 can,
 you


know,
 then
 it's
 open
 and
 you
 can
 talk


about
 it.


>> That's
 precisely
 what
 I've
 heard.
 And


so,


>> yeah.
 So,
 so
 uh,
 you
 know,
 I
 I'm
 I'm
 a


I'm
 a
 little
 bit
 uh
 concerned
 about


that.
 Now,
 what
 we're
 doing
 with
 our
 our


company
 is
 we're
 doing
 a
 new
 generation


of
 fabrication
 of
 the
 devices.
 And
 I


would
 cons
 consider
 in
 my
 my
 my
 research


we
 had
 the
 simple
 fabrication
 with
 the


original
 papers
 in
 85
 and
 then
 around


2000
 we
 had
 more
 sophisticated


fabrication
 and
 then
 for
 the
 quantum


supremacy
 experiment
 we
 did
 something


even
 more
 complicated
 other
 groups
 too


but
 we
 want
 to
 do
 a
 similar
 jump
 in
 the


fabrication
 and
 what's
 interesting
 about


this
 is
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 using
 applied


materials
 and
 the
 modern
 fabrication


processes
 that
 they
 have
 which
 on
 300
 mm


tools
 you
 know
 you
 can't
 get
 in
 China


for
 example


>> you
 can
 get
 it
 for
 camos
 and
 then


they're
 developing
 we're
 developing


standard
 processes
 but
 you
 know
 new


recipes
 and
 new
 ways
 to
 put
 it
 together


>> and
 we
 think
 by
 doing
 that
 we
 can
 do
 a


huge
 leaprog
 and
 then
 get
 there
 faster


and
 get
 there
 in
 a
 way
 that
 you
 know


will
 protect
 our
 lead.
 There's
 other


things
 we're
 doing
 too.
 Uh
 and
 you
 know


that
 that's
 a
 small
 part
 of
 it,
 but
 uh


you
 know
 we
 think
 there's
 a
 way
 to
 um


you
 know
 really
 lead
 the
 field
 and
 uh


and
 we're
 happy
 we
 have
 good
 industrial


partners
 of
 uh
 applied
 materials


synopsis
 design
 tools
 Hula
 Packard


Enterprise
 some
 startups
 who
 do
 the


theory
 work.
 Uh
 so
 you
 know
 we
 have
 a


good
 consortium
 and
 we
 want
 to
 use
 all


that
 knowledge
 and
 expertise
 of


engineering
 to
 make
 this
 happen.


>> Where
 were
 you
 when
 you
 got
 the
 news


this
 week
 that
 you
 won
 the
 Nobel
 Prize


and
 how
 surprised
 were
 you
 because
 this


is
 a
 40year-old


research
 effort.
 Had
 anyone
 giving
 you
 a


call
 rumor
 gossip
 mill
 saying,
 "Hey,


you're
 on
 the
 list
 this
 year
 potentially


being
 considered."


>> So
 let
 me
 uh
 give
 you
 a
 little
 bit
 of


the
 inside
 story.
 Um
 you
 know
 if
 you
 we


we've
 known
 that
 this
 was
 a
 important


experiment
 from
 the
 beginning.
 we've


obtained
 some
 other
 prizes
 that
 are
 you


know
 much
 less
 wellknown
 and
 really


appreciative
 of
 all
 that
 and
 you
 you


what
 happens
 is
 the
 Nobel
 um
 um
 system


uh
 put
 together
 Nobel
 symposiums
 where


they
 get
 together
 physicists
 in
 a


certain
 field
 which
 is
 quantum


information
 and
 this
 kind
 of
 thing
 and


they
 they
 give
 uh
 have
 all
 the


scientists
 give
 talks
 and
 and
 they
 want


to
 kind
 of
 check
 on
 the
 vi
 vitality
 of


the
 you
 know
 of
 the
 field,
 how
 big
 is


it?
 And
 then
 you
 know
 also
 maybe
 some
 of


the
 the
 leaders
 that
 maybe
 think
 about


it,
 you
 know,
 can
 they
 give
 a
 good
 talk?


Would
 they
 good
 be
 a
 good


representative?


So
 um
 Michelle
 and
 John
 and
 I
 have
 been


to
 these
 uh
 symposiums
 before
 and
 we


kind
 of
 knew,
 you
 know,
 what
 was
 going


on,
 you
 know,
 that
 at least
 we
 were


considered.
 And
 but
 I
 I'll
 just
 tell
 you


as
 a
 scientist
 just
 to
 be
 invited
 to


these
 and
 be
 considered
 is
 a
 is
 a


fantastic
 honor,
 you
 know,
 and
 and


having
 getting
 the
 prize
 is
 just
 so
 kind


of
 unbelievable
 that
 you
 shouldn't
 think


that
 way.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I've
 known
 about


it
 for
 a
 few
 years.
 And
 in
 fact,
 to
 be


very
 honest,
 in
 the
 past
 when
 the
 dates


have
 come
 around,
 it's
 like,
 oh,
 is
 this


going
 to
 happen?
 And
 then
 you
 wake
 up
 in


the
 morning
 and
 it's
 like,
 "Oh,
 it


didn't
 happen."
 And
 you're
 kind
 of
 down


for
 a
 day.
 You
 know,
 it
 didn't
 happen


this
 year.
 And
 that's
 a
 very
 bad


attitude.
 I
 I
 don't
 like
 that
 at
 all.


And,
 you
 know,
 you
 you
 should
 not
 covet


some,
 you
 know,
 insanely
 difficult
 uh


prize
 that,
 you
 know,
 only
 only
 goes
 to


a
 few
 people.
 So,
 what
 happened
 this


year
 is
 I
 kind
 of
 worked
 through
 this


over
 several
 years
 and
 this
 year
 I
 just


kind
 of
 forgot
 about
 it.
 Okay.
 So,
 I


went
 to
 bed
 and
 then
 uh
 and
 then
 uh
 we


got
 the
 call
 at
 3:00
 and
 my
 wife


answered
 the
 phone
 and
 found
 out
 what


happened.
 But
 um
 she
 didn't
 wake
 me
 up


right
 away
 because
 she
 knew
 if
 the
 day


was
 going
 to
 be
 hectic
 and
 I
 needed
 my


sleep
 to
 not
 be
 grumpy.
 That


>> was
 nice
 of
 her.


>> Don't
 want
 to
 be
 grumpy
 talking
 it.
 So,


she
 woke
 me
 up
 at
 5:30
 and


>> you
 know,
 as
 I
 looked
 at
 the
 computer,


oh
 my
 god.
 you
 know,
 and
 then
 we
 had


some
 reporters
 coming
 over
 at
 6


>> which,
 you
 know,
 interviewed
 me,
 you


know,
 right
 when
 I
 had
 found
 out,
 half


hour
 after
 I'd
 found
 out.


>> And
 it's
 it's
 a
 it's
 it's
 great.
 It's


it's
 a
 great
 honor
 and
 uh
 it's
 just
 been


really
 fun.
 And
 then,
 you
 know,
 I've


been
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 emails
 from
 people


I've
 worked
 with
 or
 students
 I've
 had
 in


the
 past
 congratulating
 me
 and
 you


exchange
 little
 stories
 and
 the
 like.


and
 it's
 it's
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 very


special
 time.


>> That's
 great.
 Any
 um
 science
 or


technology
 fields
 that
 you've
 been


following
 outside
 of
 your
 core


discipline
 that
 you
 think
 are
 really


exciting.
 I
 always
 like
 to
 hear
 what


major
 kind
 of
 thinkers


>> to
 be
 honest.
 I'm
 just
 so
 focused
 on


doing
 this
 and
 especially
 when
 you
 start


a
 company,
 you
 better
 be
 focused,
 right?


So,
 I'm
 doing
 that.
 But
 one
 of
 the


fields
 that
 I
 find,
 this
 is
 someone
 Ben


Mazen
 at
 UC
 Santa
 Barbara
 is
 looking
 for


exoplanets


and
 they're
 using
 superconducting


detectors
 that
 are
 somewhat
 similar
 to


what
 we're
 doing.
 In
 fact,
 in
 the
 1990s


or
 so,
 I
 helped,
 you
 know,
 helped


establish
 that
 field
 with
 other
 people


and
 did
 that
 for
 five,
 six,
 seven
 years


uh
 to
 do
 that.
 but
 he's
 doing
 it
 in
 a


different
 way.
 And
 I
 really
 like
 how,


you
 know,
 this
 instrumentation,
 you


know,
 that
 we've
 been
 working
 on
 is


their
 quantum
 devices
 are
 are
 now
 able


to
 um
 uh
 do
 these
 astronomy


uh
 detectors
 and
 and
 look
 for
 look
 for


these.
 And
 of
 course,
 there's
 so
 much


going
 on
 in
 astronomy
 these
 way
 days


with
 gravitational
 detectors
 and


exoplanet
 searches
 and
 it
 it
 it's
 just


really
 fascinating
 to
 me.
 And
 again
 it's


very
 much
 technologyoriented
 where


people
 are
 building
 good
 detectors.
 This


is
 what
 I
 like.
 Okay.
 I
 like
 building


building
 instruments.
 So
 that
 that's


particularly
 interest.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 great.
 I
 mean
 very
 exciting


field
 and
 hopefully
 will
 develop
 quantum


computers
 that
 will
 help
 us
 build


materials
 and
 technology
 to
 help
 us
 get


there
 one
 day.


>> So
 that's
 right.


>> Many
 rungs
 on
 the
 ladder
 of
 human


progress.
 Well,
 congratulations
 again
 on


winning
 the
 Nobel
 Prize
 in
 physics
 this


year.
 Very
 welld
 deserved.
 It's
 a


fantastic
 moment.
 Enjoy
 it.
 Enjoy
 the


ceremony
 and
 we're
 excited
 for
 your


continued
 work
 in
 the
 field
 of
 material


quantum
 computing.
 And
 thank
 you.


>> Yeah.
 And
 thank
 you.
 I
 really
 enjoyed


the
 questions
 and
 the
 flow
 where
 you


were
 asking
 questions
 to
 explain
 it
 at


the
 right
 level
 for
 people.
 And
 uh
 I
 I
 I


really
 appreciate
 that.
 This
 is
 a
 great


great
 podcast.


>> Great.
 Thank
 you.


[Music]


>> I'm
 going
 all
 in.
