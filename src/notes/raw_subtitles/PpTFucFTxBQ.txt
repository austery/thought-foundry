Hey
 everybody,
 welcome
 back
 to
 the


channel.
 We
 are
 back
 on
 another
 episode


of
 the
 daily
 recap.
 It
 has
 been
 five


long
 months,
 but
 we
 are
 back.
 Over
 the


past
 couple
 months,
 had
 grandparents


come
 over
 from
 India,
 was
 moving
 out
 of


my
 parents
 house
 to
 this
 new
 apartment.


So,
 honestly,
 it
 just
 became
 impossible


to
 do
 a
 daily
 recap
 every
 single
 day.


But,
 I'm
 excited
 to
 be
 back.
 For
 those


that
 are
 new
 to
 the
 channel,
 if
 you've


been
 uh
 subscribed
 over
 the
 past
 couple


months
 or
 just
 recently
 discovered
 the


channel
 through
 the
 live
 streams,
 we
 do


a
 market
 open
 and
 market
 close
 every


day,
 and
 I
 truly
 enjoy
 doing
 those
 two


live
 streams
 every
 day.
 The
 daily
 recap


is
 a
 concept
 I
 came
 up
 with
 about
 seven,


eight
 months
 ago
 to
 just
 consolidate
 all


the
 most
 important
 stories
 in
 the
 market


open,
 market
 close
 that
 people
 don't


have
 time
 to
 sit
 through
 and
 listen
 to


for
 four
 or
 five
 hours
 a
 day
 into
 one


concise
 video
 8:00
 p.m.
 Eastern
 every


day
 that
 people
 can
 watch,
 they
 can
 wake


up
 to.
 They
 can
 while
 they're
 brushing


their
 teeth,
 while
 they're
 in
 the
 car,


while
 they're
 taking
 the
 kids
 to
 work,


just
 something
 that
 gets
 you
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 gist
 of
 what
 happened
 in
 the


stock
 market
 um
 during
 the
 day.
 And
 so


unfortunately,
 again,
 life
 took
 over.


Couldn't
 do
 it
 for
 the
 past
 five
 months.


just
 got
 really
 really
 busy.
 But
 now


that
 I'm
 settled
 into
 my
 apartment,
 I'm


very
 excited
 to
 do
 this
 every
 single


day.
 One
 reason
 I
 really
 love
 doing
 it


is
 it
 keeps
 me
 a
 lot
 more
 concise
 in


analyzing
 what
 happened
 during
 the
 day.


And
 then
 the
 next
 day
 when
 I
 kind
 of
 go


back
 into
 like
 what
 happened
 the
 day


before
 because
 I
 did
 a
 daily
 recap
 and
 I


can
 kind
 of
 consolidate
 what
 happened,


why
 it
 happened,
 and
 the
 implications
 of


it
 happening.
 And
 you
 put
 all
 that
 stuff


together
 to
 continuously
 an analyze
 the


markets
 every
 day.
 kind
 of
 really
 got
 to


be
 on
 top
 of
 your
 game
 on
 understanding


every
 single
 thing
 that's
 happening
 from


a
 macros
 perspective,
 earnings


perspective,
 AI
 perspective
 now
 in
 this


market.
 And
 so
 I
 love
 doing
 them.
 I
 just


really
 got
 busy
 over
 the
 past
 couple


months,
 but
 we're
 back
 and
 I'm
 excited


to
 do
 it.
 The
 goal
 is
 15
 minutes
 each.


You
 know,
 I
 can
 yap.
 I
 can
 really
 yap.
 I


mean,
 I
 know
 how
 to
 yap.
 So,
 some
 of


these
 daily
 recaps,
 unfortunately,
 used


to
 be
 like
 25,
 30
 minutes
 long.
 And
 I


agree
 with
 a
 lot of
 people
 who
 love
 the


format,
 but
 they
 were
 just
 like,
 "Dude,


2530
 minutes
 is
 like
 not
 even
 a
 recap,


right?
 It's
 like
 it
 ends
 up
 being
 a


podcast."
 So,
 I
 do
 want
 to
 keep
 them
 15


minutes.
 We're
 going
 to
 try
 to
 do
 five


stories
 a
 day,
 three
 minutes
 each
 on


each
 story,
 and
 try
 to
 consolidate
 to


the
 most
 important
 stories
 every
 single


day.
 And
 hopefully
 we
 can
 get
 that
 to
 15


minutes.
 This
 episode
 will
 probably
 be
 a


little
 bit
 longer
 than
 15
 minutes


because
 of
 this
 intro,
 but
 the
 goal
 is


15
 minutes
 every
 single
 day,
 daily


recap.
 And
 hopefully
 people
 that
 don't


get
 the
 market
 open,
 market
 close
 can


catch
 up
 with
 all
 the
 most
 important


news
 of
 the
 day.
 And
 you
 know,
 given


Wall
 Street
 is
 the
 greatest
 show
 on


earth
 and
 it
 has
 been
 a
 crazy
 year.
 And


I
 don't
 think
 the
 years
 that
 are
 coming


are
 going
 to
 be
 any
 less
 crazier,
 having


the
 ability
 to
 look
 back
 on
 every
 single


day
 and
 see
 what
 the
 heck
 is
 happening


and
 try
 to
 analyze
 it
 to
 the
 best
 that


we
 can.
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be


important
 because
 this
 might
 be
 one
 of


the
 greatest
 decades
 to
 be
 an
 investor


and
 hopefully
 we
 get
 to
 cover
 it
 every


single
 day
 together.
 So,
 thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Daily
 recaps


are
 back
 Monday
 through
 Thursday
 8:00
 PM


Eastern
 every
 day
 and
 let's
 get
 into
 it.


All
 right,
 so
 first
 story
 of
 the
 day
 is


what
 happened
 over
 the
 weekend
 with


China.
 Now,
 obviously
 we
 had
 the
 first


negative
 3%
 down
 day
 on
 the
 S&P
 500
 for


the
 first
 time
 since
 April
 21st.
 Uh


pretty
 monstrous
 day.
 Obviously,
 we


haven't
 seen
 that
 type
 of
 a
 draw
 down
 in


the
 past
 5
 months.
 However,


Sunday
 afternoon,
 Trump
 tweeted,
 "Don't


worry
 about
 China.
 It
 will
 all
 be
 fine."


Highly
 respected
 President
 Xi
 just
 had
 a


bad
 moment.
 He
 doesn't
 want
 depression


for
 his
 country
 and
 neither
 do
 I.
 The


USA
 wants
 to
 help
 China,
 not
 hurt
 it.


Obviously,
 Trump
 deescalated
 the


situation.
 Bent
 deescalated
 the


situation
 this
 morning
 when
 he
 said,


"Hey,
 President
 Trump
 wants
 to
 work
 with


China."
 JD
 Vance
 yesterday
 deescalated


the
 situation.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 I


think
 the
 way
 this
 market
 is
 culminating


is
 by
 basically
 getting
 everyone
 to


recognize,
 wait
 a
 second,
 the
 structural


problems
 with
 the
 stock
 market
 or
 the


structural
 problems
 with
 the
 economy
 in


order
 to
 have
 pain
 on
 the
 stock
 market


needs
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 greater
 than
 a
 Trump


tweet
 because
 although
 we
 got
 that
 3%


draw
 down
 on
 Friday,
 which
 like
 look
 it


was
 it
 was
 it
 was
 bound
 to
 happen
 at


some
 point.
 You
 hadn't
 had
 a
 red
 day
 in


so
 long.
 You
 were
 going
 to
 have
 some


reason
 that
 would
 create
 some
 some
 some


downside
 momentum.
 October
 is
 also
 the


most
 volatile
 month
 of
 the
 year.
 So
 kind


of
 got
 served
 up
 on
 a
 silver
 platter


with
 Trump
 saying
 something
 about
 China.


He
 mentioned
 tariffs
 and
 then
 you
 have


the
 the
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 hot
 streak
 weak


we
 were
 on.
 It
 all
 kind
 of
 collided
 in


one
 place
 and
 it
 came
 down.
 Today
 the


rebound
 was
 800
 billion
 added
 to
 the
 S&P


500.
 It
 was
 a
 massively
 green
 day
 across


the
 entire
 board.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 dip


buying
 momentum
 came
 back.
 The


institutional
 volume
 potentially
 came


back
 today.
 We'll
 get
 uh
 more
 aggregated


consolidated
 data
 on
 that
 over
 the


coming
 days
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 much
 money


is
 actually
 buying
 this
 dip.
 And
 you're


starting
 to
 see
 more
 and
 more
 people


say,
 "Look,
 Trump
 tweeting
 about
 China


or
 China
 retaliating
 by
 saying,
 "Hey,


the
 United
 States
 is
 being
 mean
 and
 you


know,
 we
 want
 to
 we're
 going
 to
 defend


ourselves
 and
 we
 have
 the
 right
 to


defend
 ourselves."
 Which
 by
 the
 way,


China
 also
 deescalated
 to
 an
 extent
 by


saying,
 "Hey,
 like
 we
 also
 want
 to
 work


with
 the
 United
 States,
 but
 if
 they're


going to
 fight
 us,
 we're
 going
 to
 fight


back."
 Like
 both
 sides
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 it's
 an
 ego
 match.
 And
 I
 think
 what


Trump
 did
 on
 Friday
 was
 essentially


check
 China's
 ego.
 And
 quite
 frankly,
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 got
 lost
 in


translation
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 the


communication
 ended
 up
 playing
 out,


which
 is
 why
 he
 kind
 of
 fixed
 his


statements
 going
 into
 Sunday
 night.
 And


now
 the
 market's
 kind
 of
 back
 to
 normal.


S&P
 500
 was
 at
 673.
 It
 fell
 all
 the
 way


to
 647.
 Let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you


bought
 any
 of
 the
 dip
 or
 if
 you
 took
 a


swing
 at
 some
 of
 these
 stocks.
 I
 know
 a


lot
 of
 people
 bought
 BMR,
 Amazon
 Grab.


Those
 were
 some
 of
 the
 main
 names
 that
 I


saw.
 JP
 Morgan
 this
 morning
 said
 A
 to


buy
 the
 dip.
 B,
 they
 said
 the
 top
 three


stocks
 that
 retail
 bought
 based
 on
 their


data,
 Meta,
 Nvidia,
 and
 Robin
 Hood.
 So,


I
 mean,
 look,
 Hood
 went
 from
 150
 to
 130.


Nvidia
 went
 from
 195
 to
 180.
 There
 were


some
 pretty
 decent
 opportunities.
 Bit


mine
 went
 from
 62
 to
 47.
 Now,
 it's
 back


at
 56.
 The
 broader
 point
 is
 this
 is
 a


market
 that
 is
 hard
 to
 deny
 the
 earnings


growth,
 which
 we'll
 talk
 about
 in
 a
 bit.


The
 Fed
 getting
 ready
 to
 cut
 rates,


which
 is
 also
 going
 to
 be
 very
 important


for
 earnings
 growth.
 and
 these
 random


one-off
 tweets
 that
 might
 feel
 like
 it's


destroying
 the
 market
 in
 the
 short
 term.


When
 the
 VIX
 spikes
 up
 by
 30%
 end
 up


being
 that
 I
 think
 the
 takeaway
 on
 this


is
 that
 when
 the
 VIX
 spikes
 the
 way
 it


spikes,
 just
 like
 we
 saw
 in
 April,
 it


usually
 ends
 up
 being
 a
 buying


opportunity.
 To
 have
 a
 prolonged


downturn,
 you
 need
 the
 VIX
 to
 slowly
 go


up
 every
 day.
 When
 it
 happens
 all
 at


once,
 it's
 likely
 peak
 panic,
 peak
 fear.


You
 end
 up
 buying
 the
 dip.
 And
 for
 those


that
 did,
 you
 ended
 up
 not
 doing
 too


bad.
 So,
 let
 me
 know
 if
 you
 bought
 the


dip.
 And
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 markets
 are


starting
 to
 once
 again
 be
 in
 the
 most


hated
 Vshape
 as
 they
 were
 back
 in
 April.


All
 right,
 next
 story
 we've
 got
 is


Broadcom
 and
 OpenAI.
 So,
 this
 was
 a


pretty
 big
 deal
 today.
 I
 didn't
 expect


to
 see
 this
 deal,
 but
 we
 saw
 it.
 Um,


last
 week,
 OpenAI
 partnered
 with
 AMD,


six
 gawatt
 deal.
 The
 terms
 of
 the


contract
 were
 that
 AMD
 would
 get
 uh


around
 call
 it
 70
 to
 80
 billion
 of


revenue
 probably
 upwards
 of
 100
 billion


of
 revenue
 from
 OpenAI
 over
 the
 life


cycle
 of
 the
 deal.
 OpenAI
 would
 have
 to


deploy
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 AMD


MI450
 chips.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 OpenAI


would
 get
 160
 million
 shares
 or
 warrants


of
 AMD
 stock
 at
 a
 scent
 each
 effectively


for
 free.
 Uh
 which
 would
 be
 about
 10%
 of


the
 company,
 which
 is
 pretty
 cool,


right,
 for
 opening
 eye
 to
 own
 10%
 of


AMD.
 And
 you
 have
 to
 ask
 yourself,
 is


Luca
 Sue
 kind
 of
 not
 in
 the
 best


position
 of
 leverage
 and
 negotiation
 if


she
 has
 to
 give
 up
 10%
 of
 her
 company?


But
 regardless,
 the
 stock
 went
 up
 35%
 in


a
 day.
 If
 you've
 been
 holding
 AMD,
 I


mean,
 you've
 done
 very
 well.
 Uh
 that


stock
 has
 been
 dubbed
 the
 advanced
 money


destroyer
 and
 it
 turned
 into
 the


advanced
 money
 duplicator
 literally
 and


it
 quite
 frankly
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 people


that
 follow
 this
 channel
 in
 the
 chat
 uh


millionaires
 overnight.
 So
 incredible


story,
 incredible
 name.
 The
 week
 before


that,
 OpenAI
 signed
 a
 $und00
 billion


deal
 with
 Nvidia
 that
 would
 allow
 Nvidia


to
 invest
 $und00
 billion
 into
 OpenAI


rather
 than
 OpenAI
 getting
 a
 percentage


of
 Nvidia's
 company.
 Today,
 OpenAI
 came


out
 with
 an
 announcement
 that
 they
 are


now
 partnering
 with
 Broadcom.
 And
 the


idea
 of
 this
 partnership
 is
 that
 it's


going
 to
 be
 a
 10
 gawatt
 data
 center


buildout,
 which
 is
 a
 massive
 amount.


That's
 4
 gawatts
 more
 than
 what
 they
 did


with
 AMD.
 And
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 custom


ASIC
 chips
 that
 Broadcom's
 going to
 be


delivering
 to
 OpenAI.
 OpenI
 did
 a


partnership
 with
 Broadcom
 uh
 leadership


today
 as
 well.
 And
 basically
 in
 the


podcast,
 Sam
 Alman
 said,
 "Even
 if
 we
 had


30
 gigawatts
 of
 data,
 it
 would
 still
 not


be
 enough
 for
 the
 amount
 of
 demand
 that


we
 see
 coming
 through."
 Greg
 Brockman,


the
 president
 of
 OpenAI,
 also
 said,
 "We


don't
 think
 the
 industry
 and
 the
 broader


landscape
 of
 people
 that
 are
 interested


in
 AI
 understand
 the
 computational


challenges
 that
 are
 necessary
 to


actually
 build
 out
 what
 we
 think
 will


inevitably
 be
 artificial
 general


intelligence."
 What
 is
 the
 takeaway
 for


investors?
 First
 of
 all,
 if
 you're
 in


Broadcom,
 congrats.
 Stock
 was
 up
 10%
 on


the
 day.
 If
 you're
 in
 AMD
 last
 week,


congrats.
 Stock
 was
 up
 30%.
 If
 you're
 in


Nvidia,
 the
 stock
 was
 stuck
 at
 170.
 This


OpenAI
 deal
 got
 them
 up
 to
 around
 the


190s,
 so
 not
 too
 bad.
 And
 if
 you're
 in


Oracle
 at
 230
 or
 anywhere
 below
 230,


this
 deal
 with
 OpenAI,
 the
 350%
 increase


in
 remaining
 performance
 applications


pumped
 them
 up
 to
 uh
 350.
 Now
 the


stock's
 at
 300,
 but
 obviously
 OpenAI
 has


done
 very
 well
 for
 Oracle.
 The
 takeaway


is
 if
 you
 are
 in
 any
 of
 these
 AI
 names,


I
 think
 the
 first
 thing
 to
 understand
 is


that
 OpenAI
 is
 at
 the
 center
 of
 all


this.
 If
 you're
 an
 Oracle,
 Broadcom,


Nvidia,
 uh
 AMD,
 Micron,
 SMCI,
 all
 the


other
 derivative
 plays
 inside
 of
 that


semiconductor
 ecosystem,
 if
 OpenAI


doesn't
 work,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 some


issues.
 So,
 I
 think
 the
 first
 thing
 to


take
 away
 is
 that
 OpenAI
 is
 one
 of
 the


most
 important
 companies
 in
 the
 AI


landscape.
 There's
 a
 reason
 they're


worth
 $500
 billion.
 Whether
 you
 love
 Sam


Alman
 or
 hate
 him,
 it
 has
 to
 work.


Second
 of
 all,
 there's
 a
 chart
 that
 has


been
 floating
 around
 that
 I
 showed
 in


the
 market
 open
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 of


days.
 Uh
 800
 million
 weekly
 active
 users


are
 now
 are
 now
 on
 ChadBt.
 It
 took
 the


internet
 the
 whole
 worldwide
 web
 13


years
 to
 get
 to
 800
 million
 users.
 It's


a
 chatbt
 two
 and
 a
 half.
 So
 the
 level
 of


growth
 that
 we've
 seen
 in
 usage
 and


that's
 just
 chatbt
 that's
 not
 Gemini
 Xi


anthropic.
 I
 mean
 the
 level
 of
 growth


we're
 seeing
 is
 exponential.
 I
 don't


think
 we've
 ever
 seen
 that.
 I
 mean
 I


know
 we
 have
 never
 seen
 this
 type
 of


growth
 before
 in
 technology
 just
 through


the
 raw
 data.
 And
 then
 the
 creative


financing
 that
 OpenAI
 is
 engaging
 with


in
 all
 these
 deals
 to
 be
 able
 to
 lock
 in


all
 these
 contracts
 to
 me
 is
 because
 Sam


Alman
 said
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 ago
 he


needs
 a
 trillion
 dollars.
 He's
 not
 going


to
 get
 a
 trillion
 dollars
 handed
 to
 him,


but
 he's
 going
 to
 get
 into
 a
 lot
 of


these
 deals
 that
 are
 very
 creative
 and


financially
 engineered
 in
 order
 to
 get


that
 trillion
 dollars.
 If
 Sam
 Alman
 and


OpenAI
 are
 right
 that
 the
 level
 of


demand
 they
 are
 anticipating
 is


unprecedented


and
 that
 is
 why
 they
 are
 securing
 all


these
 massive
 levels
 of
 deals
 when
 it


comes
 to
 gigawatts
 and
 gigawatts
 of
 data


centers
 which
 by
 the
 way
 helps
 Iran


Cororeweave
 Nebas
 Bit
 Farms
 CleanSpark


all
 the
 other
 companies
 Galaxy
 Digital


um
 Marathon
 the
 the
 Bitcoin
 mining


companies
 that
 have
 transitioned
 into


the
 Nebuses
 of
 of
 of
 data
 centers
 and


now
 they're
 completely
 turning
 around


their
 business
 models
 to
 supply
 the


demand
 to
 the
 hyperscalers.
 Obviously,


it
 helps
 Google,
 Microsoft,
 and
 Amazon


if
 there's
 that
 much
 demand.
 It
 means


the
 story
 continues.
 If
 you're
 in
 those


stocks,
 obviously
 you've
 got
 to
 keep
 up


with
 the
 valuations
 and
 execution
 of


those
 companies.
 But
 the
 broader
 macro


theme
 for
 AI
 based
 on
 these
 four
 Open
 AI


deals,
 Oracle,
 AMD,
 Nvidia,
 and
 Broadcom


that
 we've
 seen
 over
 the
 past
 four


weeks,
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 it's
 slowing


down.
 All right,
 next
 topic
 for
 the
 day.


BMR,
 Tom
 Lee.
 He
 is
 buying
 more


Ethereum.
 It
 took
 me
 a
 while
 to
 fully


understand
 the
 digital
 asset
 treasury


thesis.
 Tom
 Lee
 was
 nice
 enough
 to
 come


on
 the
 market
 open
 and
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


you
 guys
 got
 to
 watch
 him
 on
 the
 show


explain
 what
 he's
 doing.
 Um,
 and
 then


after
 that
 it
 kind
 of
 started
 making
 a


lot
 more
 sense
 to
 me.
 There's
 two


reasons
 I'm
 excited
 about
 Ethereum
 and


those
 reasons
 have
 been
 really
 well


articulated
 by
 Tom
 Lee
 on
 like
 a
 hundred


podcasts
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 months


which
 is
 stable
 coins
 and
 tokenization.


If
 you
 believe
 that
 Wall
 Street
 wants
 to


tokenize
 traditional
 financial
 assets


that's
 happening
 on
 Ethereum,
 that's
 a


reason
 to
 be
 bullish
 on
 Ethereum.
 If
 you


believe
 that
 stable
 coins
 are
 going
 to


be
 a
 new
 way
 that
 we
 transact
 and
 that


money
 gets
 settled
 in
 different


countries,
 crossber
 payments,
 etc.,


that's
 going
 to
 be
 done
 on
 Ethereum.
 In


fact,
 the
 stable
 coin
 market
 cap
 right


now
 is
 305
 billion.
 159
 billion
 of
 that


total
 stable
 coin
 market
 cap
 supply
 is


on
 Ethereum.
 So,
 in
 a
 nutshell,
 the


reason
 I'm
 bullish
 on
 Ethereum
 and
 the


reason
 I'm
 starting
 to
 learn
 more
 about


Ethereum
 is
 because
 Wall
 Street,
 Robin


Hood,
 PayPal,
 JP
 Morgan,
 Goldman
 Sachs,


Black
 Rockck,
 they
 are
 all
 getting


excited
 about
 Ethereum.
 And
 when
 Wall


Street
 gets
 excited,
 you've
 got


trillions
 of
 dollars
 that
 are
 ready
 to


institutionalize
 the
 asset.
 BMR
 is
 just


Tom
 Lee
 institutionalizing
 the
 asset
 at


a
 faster
 pace
 than
 any
 of
 us
 can
 by


issuing
 stock
 to
 shareholders
 at
 a


premium,
 a
 premium
 to
 your
 net
 asset


value.
 And
 based
 on
 that
 net
 asset
 value


premium,
 he
 is
 able
 to
 buy
 more
 Ethereum


because
 he's
 able
 to
 dilute
 stock
 and


issue
 stock.
 And
 as
 Ethereum
 rises,
 the


premium
 on
 the
 MNAV
 rises
 as
 well.
 We've


seen
 this
 story
 play
 out
 with
 Micro


Strategy.
 Bitcoin
 went
 up
 10x.
 Micro


Strategy
 went
 up
 30x
 uh
 since
 Micro


Strategy
 started
 implementing
 the


strategy
 and
 it
 has
 worked
 out
 really


well.
 Today,
 Tom
 Lee
 came
 out
 and
 said


they
 have
 3
 million
 Ethereum.
 They


bought
 202,000
 Ethereum
 over
 the
 3%
 draw


down
 that
 we
 got
 from
 uh
 from
 the
 Trump


Truth
 Social
 China
 Post.
 Uh
 that


probably
 got
 them
 to
 buy
 Ethereum
 at


around
 that
 37
 $3,800
 price
 range.
 And


they
 now
 have
 more
 than
 half
 the
 supply


of
 Ethereum.
 They're
 trying
 to
 get
 to
 5%


or
 sorry,
 they
 have
 2.5%
 of
 their
 5%.
 So


they're
 halfway
 towards
 their
 full


supply
 of
 getting
 to
 that
 alchemy
 of
 5%.


The
 alchemy
 of
 5%
 is
 essentially
 this


concept
 by
 Tom
 Lee
 of
 saying,
 "Hey,
 we


can
 start
 staking
 when
 we
 get
 5%
 of


Ethereum
 and
 we
 can
 start
 lending
 out


Ethereum.
 We
 can
 start
 building


applications
 on
 top
 of
 the
 Ethereum


network
 that
 we're
 building."
 And
 so
 at


its
 core,
 he
 wants
 to
 get
 to
 5%
 of


Ethereum.
 I
 think
 he's
 going
 to
 get


there
 pretty
 soon.
 I
 mean,
 it
 looks
 like


by
 February,
 March,
 if
 he
 continues
 this


pace
 of
 buying
 and
 if
 Ethereum
 tends
 to


uh
 do
 well,
 you
 know,
 he
 has
 a
 public


price
 target
 of
 10
 to
 12,000
 by
 the
 end


of
 the
 year.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's


going
 to
 happen.
 I
 don't
 know if
 his


Bitcoin
 price
 target
 of
 200,000
 is
 going


to
 happen.
 If
 it
 does
 happen,
 I
 would
 be


very
 happy.
 I
 have
 a
 large
 Robin
 Hood


position.
 Robin
 would
 probably
 do
 very


well
 if
 those
 assets
 go
 up.
 But
 at
 its


core,
 I
 think
 Ethereum
 long-term
 will
 be


worth
 more
 than
 what
 it
 is
 today
 at


4,000.
 And
 these
 dips
 are
 just


opportunities
 for
 Tom
 Lee
 to
 load
 up.
 If


Ethereum
 goes
 up,
 he's
 able
 to
 issue


more
 stock,
 able
 to
 buy
 more
 Ethereum.


And
 if
 Ethereum
 goes
 up
 longterm,
 you're


going
 to
 have
 that
 MNAV.
 Just
 like
 a


company
 would
 have
 a
 price
 to
 earnings,


right?
 Like
 the
 reason
 you
 pay
 a
 high


price
 to
 earnings
 on
 a
 company
 that's


growing
 really
 fast
 is
 because
 A,


they're
 growing
 really
 fast.
 be
 the


quality
 of
 the
 company
 warrants
 a
 higher


multiple
 that
 you
 pay
 to
 access
 their


earnings.
 In
 the
 context
 of
 Bitmine,
 the


velocity
 at
 which
 they're
 able
 to
 buy


Ethereum
 warrants
 the
 ability
 and
 their


ability
 to
 raise
 money,
 which
 again
 is


not
 easy
 to
 do.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 digital


asset
 treasure
 companies
 out
 there.


There's
 it's
 not
 that
 easy
 to
 raise


money
 and
 then
 execute
 the
 deployment
 of


that
 capital
 in
 a
 way
 that
 Bitine
 has


done.
 A
 lot
 of
 that
 being
 the
 Tom
 Lee


premium.
 He
 is
 a
 guy
 who
 gets
 people
 to


believe
 in
 the
 thesis.
 And
 you
 kind
 of


need
 people
 to
 believe
 in
 that
 thesis
 in


order
 to
 have
 that
 premium
 against
 your


net
 asset
 value
 which
 now
 is
 $12.9


billion.
 He's
 able
 to
 do
 it.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 because
 he's
 able
 to
 do
 it,
 I


continue
 to
 trust
 Tom
 Lee,
 continue
 to


hold
 on
 to
 my
 BitMine.
 And
 now
 they
 have


2.5%
 of
 the
 entire
 supply
 of
 Ethereum


that's
 out
 there.
 All right,
 next
 story


today.
 Howard
 Marks.
 So,
 um,
 this
 was


pretty
 incredible.
 If
 you
 know
 anything


about
 Howard
 Marks,
 he
 is
 a
 value


investor.
 He
 is
 one
 of the
 best
 value


investors
 of
 all
 time.
 Uh
 he
 is
 someone


I
 looked
 into
 very
 deeply
 because
 he


does
 have
 a
 massive
 position
 in
 Grab.


Grab
 is
 a
 name
 that
 I
 am
 uh
 pretty


excited
 about.
 I
 have a
 pretty
 big


position.
 A
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 know
 my


thesis
 on
 Grab.
 If
 you
 haven't
 read
 it,


grab
 thesis.com.
 You
 can
 easily
 read
 the


thesis.
 Um
 by
 the
 way,
 my
 deep
 dives
 on


Substack,
 they'll
 be
 launching
 this


week.
 So

for
 those
 that
 want
 to
 subscribe.
 Uh


free
 to
 subscribe.
 No
 payw
 wall.
 You'll


be
 able
 to
 get
 all
 my
 deep
 dives,
 which


is
 my
 long-term
 written
 research
 that's


going
 to
 be
 out
 starting
 this
 week.


Howard
 Marks
 is
 someone
 I
 started


studying
 because
 of
 his
 interest
 in


grap.
 And
 so
 I'm
 like,
 okay,
 let
 me
 get


to
 know
 Howard
 Marks.
 And
 over
 the


course
 of
 the
 past
 three
 months,
 I


really
 got
 to
 understand
 Howard
 Marks.


Last
 month,
 he
 did
 an
 interview
 on


Bloomberg.
 And
 let's
 just
 say
 he
 wasn't


the
 most
 excited
 about
 the
 state
 of


valuations.
 He
 wasn't
 the
 most
 excited


about
 the
 stock
 market.
 Broadly


speaking,
 he
 said
 he's
 cautious
 and


worried
 that
 there
 might
 be
 the
 early


days
 of
 a
 bubble
 forming.
 Today,
 I
 don't


know
 what
 changed
 over
 the
 past
 month.


And
 you
 can
 go
 watch
 the
 Bloomberg


interview
 from
 a
 month
 ago.
 Type
 in


Howard
 Marks
 of
 Bloomberg
 on
 YouTube
 and


and
 go
 watch
 the
 interview
 because
 this


month
 we
 got
 a
 full
 180.
 Three
 things
 he


said
 this
 morning.
 Number
 one,
 I
 don't


see
 mania
 in
 the
 market
 right
 now.


I
 mean
 that's
 that's
 that's
 a
 pretty
 big


statement
 for
 Howard
 Marks
 to
 say
 I


don't
 see
 euphoric
 mania.
 Howard
 Marks


is
 the
 guy
 who
 actually
 predicted
 the
 do


bubble.
 He
 made
 his
 name
 during
 that


time.
 So
 for
 him
 to
 say
 I
 don't
 see


mania,
 you
 know,
 one
 could
 say
 it's
 a


top
 signal.
 Another
 person
 could
 say


well
 Howard
 Marks
 probably
 understands
 a


little
 bit
 about
 bubbles.
 Number
 two,
 he


said
 the
 S&P
 500
 is
 expensive
 which
 I


will
 agree
 with
 as
 well.
 trades
 at
 26


times,
 historically
 trades
 at
 18
 times,


but
 he
 said
 the
 quality
 of
 companies
 are


much
 better.
 So,
 you've
 got
 him
 making


the
 excuse,
 same
 excuse
 that
 Tom
 Lee


makes,
 same
 excuse
 that
 uh
 you
 know,


your
 favorite
 equity
 analyst
 that
 has
 a


7,000


price
 target
 on
 the
 S&P
 is
 the
 same


excuse
 they
 will
 make,
 which
 is
 like,


yeah,
 it's
 expensive,
 but
 like
 the


quality
 of
 the
 companies
 are
 better.


Nvidia,
 Amazon
 is
 not
 Proctor
 and
 Gamble


and
 Coca-Cola,
 so
 we
 can't
 be
 that
 upset


about
 the
 multiple
 expansion
 that
 we're


seeing.
 And
 then
 finally,
 he
 said,
 I


quote,
 "I'd
 struggle
 to
 call
 the
 market


a
 bubble
 right
 now."
 I
 think
 it's


important
 to
 cover
 this
 because
 Howard


Marks
 is
 not
 some
 random
 average


investor,
 and
 he's
 not
 some
 guy
 who's


going
 to
 say
 something
 just
 for
 the
 hell


of
 saying
 it.
 He
 usually
 speaks
 his


mind.
 I
 mean,
 he's
 a
 very
 authentic


individual.
 That's
 why
 a
 lot
 of
 people


respect
 and
 value
 his
 philosophy.
 For


him
 to
 come
 out
 and
 say,
 "I
 don't
 think


we're
 in
 a
 bubble,
 and
 that
 valuations


are
 aggressive,
 but
 they're
 not


unwarranted,
 and
 that
 the
 S&P
 500
 is


filled
 with
 quality
 companies,
 and
 I


don't
 see
 stock
 market
 mania."
 I
 mean,


one
 could
 argue
 there's
 plenty
 of
 mania


happening
 in
 the
 market
 and
 you
 know,


you've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 names
 that
 are
 very


frothy
 that
 have
 tens
 of
 billions
 of


dollars
 in
 market
 cap,
 don't
 have
 any


revenues.
 Um,
 but
 I
 think
 Howard
 Marx's


argument
 is
 well,
 if
 those
 companies
 go


to
 zero,
 it
 doesn't
 really
 matter.
 If


there
 was
 mania
 in
 Amazon,
 Nvidia,


Microsoft,
 which
 means
 they
 would
 be


trading
 at
 astronomically
 higher


multiples
 than
 they
 are
 right
 now,


MetaTrad
 at
 25
 times
 forward
 earnings.


That's
 not
 expensive.
 Nvidia
 trades
 at


27
 times,
 2027.
 That's
 not
 expensive,


right?
 It's
 just
 not.
 You
 probably
 don't


have
 a
 bubble.
 So,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 very


encouraging
 to
 see
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


value
 investors
 come
 out
 today
 and
 say


he
 doesn't
 think
 the
 market's
 in
 that


bad
 of
 a
 situation
 from
 a
 euphoric


valuation
 perspective.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


you
 know,
 if
 we
 have
 good
 earnings
 and


you
 have
 some
 of
 the
 big
 guys
 thinking


that
 this
 market
 does
 make
 sense,
 maybe


there's
 a
 world
 where
 the
 markets
 not


only
 go
 higher,
 but
 justifiably
 based
 on


the
 earnings
 growth
 continue
 to
 have
 the


momentum
 to
 go
 higher.
 All
 right,
 last


topic
 for
 the
 day.
 Thank
 you
 again
 for


joining
 the
 daily
 recap.
 Hopefully,


we'll
 be
 able
 to
 make
 sure
 it's


efficient
 every
 single
 day
 at
 that
 five


stories,
 3
 minutes
 each,
 15
 minutes
 an


episode.
 Um,
 again,
 really,
 really


appreciate
 all
 the
 support
 and
 thank
 you


all
 for
 joining.
 We
 got
 that
 100,000


subscriber
 uh
 plaque
 right
 there
 in
 the


in
 the
 background
 and
 it's
 because
 of


you
 guys.
 So,
 thank
 you
 for
 consuming


the
 content
 and

 every
 single
 day.
 Gold
 and


silver,
 gold
 and
 silver
 and
 copper
 and


all
 precious
 metals
 for
 for
 that


respect.
 Gold
 prices
 at
 a
 new
 alltime


high
 today.
 Gold
 is
 up
 65%


year-to-
 date.
 Silver
 is
 up
 69%
 69.65%


year-to
 date.
 Copper
 is
 up
 30%
 year-to


date.
 I
 mean,
 it
 is
 really
 hard
 to


calculate
 the
 magnitude
 of
 the
 move
 that


is
 happening
 in
 precious
 metals.
 And


obviously
 Trump
 has
 said
 he
 wants
 to
 put


an
 emphasis
 on
 rare
 earth
 metals,
 rare


earth
 minerals.
 Uh
 you've
 seen
 TMQ,
 USR,


MP,
 all
 these
 stocks
 go
 up
 three
 to
 5x


on
 the
 year
 based
 on
 Trump
 either
 taking


an
 equity
 stake
 in
 those
 companies.


Lithium
 Americas
 is
 another
 one,
 CRML,


Critical
 uh
 Minerals
 is
 another
 one,
 or


uh
 just
 signaling
 that
 they
 are
 going
 to


pull
 back
 regulation
 like
 they
 did
 for


TMQ
 on
 Friday
 uh
 or
 on
 Thursday,
 getting


rid
 of
 some
 of
 the
 uh
 Biden
 era


regulations
 that
 stopped
 the
 mining
 of


certain
 areas
 in
 Alaska
 and
 TMQ
 went
 to


the
 moon.
 So,


a
 lot
 of these
 companies
 don't
 have


revenue.
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 companies
 don't


have
 earnings.
 However,
 in
 this
 market,


that's
 not
 exactly
 what
 matters.
 Oaklo,


a
 company
 that's
 in
 the
 nuclear
 space


that
 has
 no
 revenue.
 It's
 worth
 25


billion
 because
 maybe
 one
 day
 Trump


gives
 them
 a
 $5
 billion
 deal
 or


Microsoft
 gives
 them
 a
 $5
 billion
 deal


because
 Microsoft
 needs
 a
 lot
 of
 energy


for
 data
 centers
 and
 these
 small
 nuclear


reactors,
 SMOR,
 small
 modular
 reactors


are
 going
 to
 be
 positioned
 somewhere
 in


the
 nuclear
 ecosystem
 and
 it
 might
 go
 to


a
 Google,
 a
 Microsoft
 or
 a
 Meta
 or
 any


other
 entity
 that
 needs
 a
 lot
 of
 energy


and
 then
 boom,
 Oaklo
 gets
 revenue


overnight.
 I
 think
 the
 same
 thing
 is


happening
 with
 these
 rare
 earth
 metals


and
 rare
 earth
 mineral
 companies.
 So


then
 the
 question
 simply
 becomes
 why
 are


gold
 and
 silver
 running?
 And
 I
 think


there's
 two
 simple
 answers
 and
 I
 would


love
 to
 know
 thoughts
 in
 the
 comments
 as


well
 for
 why
 you
 think
 gold
 and
 silver


are
 moving
 the
 way
 they're
 moving.


Number
 one,
 um
 you're
 going
 to
 need
 a


lot
 of
 those
 precious
 metals
 to
 build


out
 data
 centers.
 Copper
 is
 one
 of
 the


main
 ones
 that
 my
 uncle
 in
 Singapore


who's
 been,
 you
 know,
 he's
 been
 he's


been
 deeply
 studying
 copper
 for
 a
 long


time,
 um
 he
 started
 talking
 to
 me
 a


couple
 weeks
 ago
 and
 said,
 "Dude,
 all


these
 data
 centers,
 you
 need
 a
 lot
 of


copper."
 And
 I
 started
 doing
 my
 own


research
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Shit,
 you
 do


you
 do
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 copper.
 You
 also


need
 a
 lot
 of
 aluminum."
 I
 mean,
 you
 all


these
 precious
 metals
 are
 starting
 to


find
 a
 bid,
 I
 think,
 in
 the
 renewed
 AI


capex
 um
 I
 guess
 you
 could
 say


philosophy
 that's
 being
 formed,
 which
 is


that
 you
 need
 as
 much
 compute
 as


possible.
 You
 need
 as
 much
 capacity
 as


as
 possible,
 which
 means
 the
 prices
 on


all
 these
 assets
 are
 getting
 bid
 up
 even


before
 they're
 being
 utilized
 because


the
 market
 already
 understands
 how
 much


demand
 is
 coming.
 Which
 is
 what
 we're


seeing
 with
 all
 these
 data
 center
 stocks


that
 are
 getting
 excitement.
 The
 other


simple
 argument
 for
 why
 they're
 running


up
 is
 because
 cash
 is
 not
 where
 you
 want


to
 be.
 Goldman
 Sachs
 came
 out
 three


weeks
 ago
 and
 says,
 "Dude,
 if
 the
 dollar


is
 losing
 purchasing
 power
 and
 the


dollar
 is
 not
 really
 going
 to
 be
 the


most
 exciting
 asset
 over
 the
 next
 couple


years,
 uh
 which
 by
 the
 way,
 the
 dollar


is
 down
 about
 10%
 for
 the
 year,
 you've


got
 to
 be
 somewhere
 else.
 You
 got
 to
 be


in
 digital
 gold
 like
 a
 Bitcoin.
 You've


got
 to
 be
 in
 an
 Ethereum.
 You've
 got
 to


be
 in
 the
 S&P
 500.
 You
 got
 to
 be
 in
 the


NASDAQ.
 You
 got
 to
 be
 in
 tech
 stocks.
 Or


you
 got
 to
 be
 in
 copper,
 gold,
 silver,


precious
 metals
 that
 are
 going
 to
 do
 a


lot
 better
 than
 the
 dollar.
 I
 mean,
 to


give
 some
 context,
 it
 took
 gold
 10
 years


to
 double
 from
 2010
 to
 2020.
 It
 took


gold
 two
 and
 a
 half
 years
 to
 double
 from


2022
 or
 sorry
 from
 less
 than
 two
 and
 a


half
 years
 about
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 from


2024
 January
 to
 now
 to
 double.
 So,
 it


has
 taken
 a
 long
 time
 for
 gold
 to
 start


getting
 this
 type
 of
 interest,
 but
 now


you
 got
 gold
 basically
 doubling
 in
 a


year
 and
 a
 half.
 And
 the
 question


becomes
 why?
 And
 I
 think
 the
 answer
 is


you're
 going to
 need
 more
 and
 more


precious
 metals
 in
 a
 variety
 of
 use


cases
 across
 this
 entire
 ecosystem
 for


AI,
 which
 is
 very
 important.
 But
 B,
 you


don't
 want
 to
 be
 stuck
 in
 cash.
 And
 so,


I
 would
 be
 very
 curious
 from
 people
 in


the
 comments
 on
 do
 you
 believe
 this


gold,
 silver,
 copper,
 precious
 metals


rally
 is
 real?
 Do
 you
 think
 it
 can


survive?
 Do
 you
 think
 it
 can
 last?
 Is
 it


a
 bubble?
 Does
 it
 have
 enough
 momentum


to
 keep
 going?
 or
 is
 this
 a
 multi-deade


breakout
 that's
 happening
 and
 if
 rates


are
 coming
 down
 which
 means
 earnings
 are


going
 to
 be
 not
 only
 good
 which
 we
 get


into
 bank
 earnings
 next
 week
 bank


earnings
 start
 tomorrow
 so
 we'll
 talk


more
 about
 bank
 earnings
 but
 rates
 are


coming
 down
 which
 means
 you
 have
 a


premium
 on
 earnings
 growth
 and
 you
 have


a
 premium
 on
 anything
 that
 is
 growing


outside
 of
 the
 dollar
 which
 is
 not


growing
 as
 the
 rates
 come
 down
 which


means
 the
 dollar
 is
 less
 valuable
 does


that
 mean
 precious
 metals
 continue
 to


have
 a
 bid
 I
 mean
 I
 would
 love
 to
 know


what
 people
 think
 but
 it
 seems
 like
 the


rally
 in
 gold
 silver
 and
 copper
 is
 not


stopping
 All
 right,
 thank
 you
 everybody


for
 joining.
 Deeply
 appreciate
 being


back

 the
 first
 episode
 of
 the
 Daily

 This
 one
 was
 probably
 a
 little


bit
 longer
 than
 15
 minutes.
 We
 will
 try


to
 make
 it
 as
 efficient
 as
 possible


going
 forward
 in
 the
 future.

through
 Thursday,

 PM


Eastern,

get

 to
 the
 daily
 recap.
 Thank
 you


everybody.
 Appreciate
 you
