So
 I
 heard
 um
 I
 heard
 that
 uh
 the


founder
 of
 Ferrari
 Enzo
 Ferrari
 once
 uh


was
 stuck
 in
 a
 lift
 and
 and
 and
 lost
 a


race.
 Notice


notice
 he
 lost
 the
 race
 and
 never
 took
 a


lift
 again.
 That's
 true.
 You
 studied


very
 well
 history.
 Yeah,
 it's
 true.


Absolutely.
 It
 was
 in
 Piscara.


So
 um
 uh
 Benedto,
 you
 say
 that
 uh


Ferrari
 is
 not
 the
 car.
 It's
 a
 dream
 and


um
 in
 1
 hour
 and
 35
 minutes
 you
 will


bring
 out
 a
 new
 dream.
 Yeah.
 Because
 you


have
 a
 car
 launch
 today.
 Two
 dreams
 with


two
 car
 two
 special
 version
 of
 a
 car


coming
 out
 today.
 Yeah.
 So
 good
 timing


with
 this
 seminar.
 Yeah.
 Very
 good.
 Uh


you
 should
 have
 been
 waiting
 and
 we


could
 show
 but
 we
 can't
 show
 any


pictures
 because
 it's
 like
 1
 hour
 and
 35


minutes
 early.
 But
 what
 can
 you
 tell
 us


about
 these
 two
 new
 cars?
 Look
 we
 have


innovation
 is
 very
 key.
 I
 was
 listening


the
 presentation
 of
 David
 and
 Judy.


Innovation
 is
 key
 and
 uh
 this
 year
 is


very
 important
 for
 us
 because
 we
 will


have
 six
 new
 model
 that
 will
 propose
 to


the
 world
 and
 the
 first
 two
 will
 be


announced
 in
 a
 few
 minutes.


So
 if
 you
 had
 to
 if
 you
 had
 to
 say


something
 about
 them.
 Four
 wheels,
 one


steering


wheel,
 some
 aluminum,
 some
 glass.
 No,


you
 you
 you
 have
 to
 wait
 because
 we
 had


a
 meeting
 with
 our
 with
 journalist.


Yeah.
 Everything
 is
 under
 embargo.
 So
 if


I
 I
 say
 something
 Yeah,
 I
 know.
 But
 I


can
 tell
 you
 that
 is
 special
 version
 of


hybrid
 car


and
 uh
 it
 will


be
 I
 drove
 it
 several
 times.
 It's
 very


funny.
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 client.
 One
 of


them
 was
 texting
 me
 now,
 can
 I
 see


something?
 Can
 I
 see
 something?
 I
 said


you
 have
 to
 wait
 also
 Nikolai
 is
 asking


something
 you
 have
 to
 wait
 a
 little
 bit


I
 cannot
 make
 a
 difference


okay
 uh
 what
 uh
 just
 coming
 back
 to
 uh


to
 Patrick's
 comment
 I
 mean
 what
 is


Ferrari
 in
 in
 your
 mind
 what
 what
 is
 it


Ferrari
 I
 mean
 we
 have
 been
 working
 in


the
 last
 years
 since
 I
 I
 came
 over
 there


because
 Ferrari
 was
 missing
 if
 you
 want


a
 formal
 brand
 bible
 so
 we


clarified
 the
 the
 purpose
 of
 Ferrari
 and


this
 was
 done
 listening
 to
 all
 the


people
 in
 the
 company
 and
 we
 the
 purpose


of
 our
 company
 is
 very
 simple
 is
 the


following.
 We
 audaciously
 redefine
 the


limit
 of
 possible.
 I
 as
 you
 said
 I
 mean


I
 was
 working
 in
 a
 in
 a
 different
 world


in
 a
 different
 space
 for
 25
 years
 in
 a


space
 we
 were
 we
 were
 making
 I
 was


working
 for
 a
 company
 making
 chips
 and


that
 world
 is
 moving
 at
 very
 high
 pace


very
 high
 pace
 when
 you
 go
 in
 a
 company


such
 as
 Ferrari
 that
 is
 a
 luxury
 company


you
 see
 something
 that
 is
 really
 unique


is
 the
 human
 dimension
 the
 human


dimension
 the
 passion
 the
 sense
 of


belonging
 that
 you
 see
 in
 people
 in


Ferrari
 but
 also
 all
 the
 stakeholders


and
 the
 people
 around
 Ferrari
 is
 very


unique.
 So
 I
 like
 to
 say
 that
 Ferrari
 is


the


glue
 around
 the
 people
 putting
 them
 for


the
 people
 pushing
 them
 toward


redefinition
 of
 of
 what
 is
 possible
 that


that's
 but
 I
 mean
 in
 your
 previous
 job


where
 you
 do
 microchips
 you
 reinvent
 uh


yourself
 every
 18
 24
 months
 or
 whatever


new
 new
 models
 and
 so
 on.
 Now
 with


Ferrari,
 what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the


things
 that
 you
 do
 reinvent
 and
 what
 are


the
 things
 that
 need
 to
 be
 the
 same?
 I


mean
 you
 got
 some
 you
 got
 some
 iconic


things,
 right?
 The
 yellow
 clock
 in
 the


middle,
 all
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 Yeah.


Which
 of
 course
 I
 don't
 know
 so
 much


about,
 but
 you
 know
 much
 more
 a
 little


bit.
 No,
 look,
 I
 I
 can
 tell
 you


something.
 I
 shared
 with
 the
 team
 after


the
 capital
 market
 day.
 It
 was
 16th
 June


22
 when
 we
 had
 capital
 market
 day.
 The


day
 after
 we
 did
 deployment
 in
 all
 the


company
 and
 I
 was
 with
 the
 the
 leader


the
 management
 of
 the
 company
 and
 I
 said


look
 you
 believe
 you
 are
 fast
 I
 told


them
 I
 told
 them
 you
 are
 not


fast
 silence
 a
 lot
 of
 said
 you
 are
 fast


yes
 if
 you
 compare
 yourself
 with


automotive
 companies
 you
 are
 fast
 but
 if


you
 compare
 with
 high-tech
 companies
 you


are
 not
 fast
 and
 then
 I
 told
 them
 three


things
 one
 the
 speed
 of
 automotive


companies
 is
 one
 the
 speed
 of
 Ferrari
 is


10
 the
 speed
 of
 high-tech
 is


100.
 Do
 we
 need
 as
 a
 company
 to
 go
 to


100?
 No.
 Because
 high-tech
 companies


don't
 care
 about
 the


past.
 The
 past
 in
 high-tech
 company
 is
 a


burden.
 In
 a
 luxury
 company,
 the
 past
 is


a
 fundamental
 ingredient.
 So
 where
 we


are
 aiming
 to
 be
 as
 a
 company.
 For
 me


the
 indicator
 is
 30
 35
 where
 we
 are
 in


terms
 of
 speed
 after
 three
 years
 and
 a


half
 I
 would
 say
 around


1820.
 So
 what
 does
 it
 mean?
 There
 are


opportunities
 for
 us
 to
 improve
 on
 the


operational
 efficiency.
 There
 are


opportunities
 for
 us
 to
 improve
 on
 on


innovation.
 The
 company
 is
 doing


relatively
 well.
 But
 I
 always
 push
 the


team
 to
 stay
 really
 with
 the
 four
 wheels


on
 the
 ground.
 Nowadays
 more
 than
 ever


it's
 important
 to
 be
 prudent
 to


understand
 what
 are
 the
 areas
 where
 you


can
 improve.
 So
 it
 company
 have
 a


different


mindset
 different
 culture
 the
 company
 I


don't
 know
 maybe
 some
 of
 you
 have
 been


working
 over
 there
 it
 is
 a
 speed
 for
 the


sake
 of
 speed
 because
 otherwise
 you


don't
 you
 lose
 the
 you
 know
 you
 lose
 the


grip
 in
 a
 in
 in
 a
 luxury
 company
 does


not
 make
 sense.
 So
 you
 would
 destroy


yourself.
 So
 where
 in
 the
 company
 where


in
 the
 company
 do
 you
 need
 speed?
 I


think
 that
 there
 are
 speed
 on
 speed
 we


need
 to
 achieve
 by
 deleting
 something


that
 is
 not
 bringing
 value
 to
 client.


That
 is
 important.
 I
 think
 there
 are


different
 areas.
 It
 goes
 in
 in


production.
 It
 goes
 on
 the
 on
 the
 the


marketing.
 It
 goes
 in
 the
 communication.


It
 goes
 I
 mean
 there
 are
 different


areas.
 I
 think
 no
 company
 is
 perfect.


Nobody
 will
 no
 company
 will
 be
 ever


perfect
 is
 always
 an
 improving
 process.


I
 think
 that
 we
 have
 to
 to
 be
 conscious


of
 this
 and
 we
 have
 to
 work
 on
 that.


Have
 a
 you
 know
 humility
 I
 would
 say.


Absolutely.
 How
 have
 you
 changed
 the


corporate
 since
 you
 came
 in?
 What
 are


the
 things
 you've
 changed?
 But
 uh
 what
 I


understand
 I
 changed
 if
 I
 listen
 to
 what


people
 tell
 me
 is
 that
 I
 am
 and
 this
 is


not
 a
 critic
 at
 all
 for
 all
 the
 people


before
 me
 because
 each
 leadership
 style


is
 good
 I
 think
 for
 each
 historical


moment.
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 the
 attention
 of


of
 the
 company
 to
 employee
 has
 been


always
 there.
 I
 have
 to
 say
 that
 one
 of


the
 reason
 why
 also
 I
 selected
 to
 join


Ferrari
 is
 because
 of
 tension
 of
 the


company
 to
 the
 grow
 and
 development
 of


employee.
 I
 remember
 when
 I
 had
 the


discussion
 with
 the
 board
 member
 and
 I


saw
 the
 program
 and
 investment
 on
 the


grow
 employee
 that
 that
 was
 for
 me
 an


important
 decide
 I
 mean
 factor
 there
 is


also
 another
 point
 is
 the
 uh
 how
 do
 you


say
 there's
 mutual
 respect
 is
 there
 I


think
 two
 things
 I
 brought
 one
 is
 more


open
 communication


I
 don't
 I I
 spend
 I
 would
 say
 1%
 of
 my


time
 in
 my
 office
 I
 am
 always
 with


people
 and
 I
 I
 talk
 with
 all
 the
 people


across
 different
 organizational
 level.


Well,
 I
 mean
 you
 actually
 like
 people,


right?
 I
 Yeah,
 I
 like
 people
 because
 I


think
 that's
 the
 easiest
 and
 the
 best


way
 to
 learn.
 You
 can
 read
 books,
 but


the
 point
 is
 that
 takes
 more
 time
 and


then
 how
 many
 how
 many
 people
 do
 you


speak
 how
 many
 people
 you
 speak
 to?


Because
 because
 I
 generally
 because
 I


generally
 speak
 generally
 speak
 I
 don't


think
 we
 speak
 with
 enough
 people.
 I


agree
 with
 you.
 Look,
 I
 I
 I
 had
 the
 luck


to
 have
 I
 was
 working
 for
 this
 company
 I


was
 telling
 you
 before
 and
 the
 CEO
 that


now
 is
 89
 years
 old
 before
 stepping
 in


the
 role,
 I
 call
 it
 many
 friends,
 young


CEO
 and
 old
 CEO,
 old
 in
 the
 role
 I
 mean


and
 I
 got
 some
 advices
 and
 this
 CEO,
 the


previous
 CEO
 of
 the
 company
 I
 was


working
 for,
 three
 CEO
 before
 he
 told
 me


talk
 to
 the
 people
 onetoone.
 So
 when
 I


get
 in
 the
 company
 I
 asked
 my
 assistant


to
 arrange


300
 interview
 one
 to
 one
 to
 be
 to
 do
 in


uh
 let's
 say
 90
 days
 and
 that's
 what
 I


did.
 I
 mean
 all
 levels
 of
 the
 all
 levels


I
 think
 why
 why
 is
 that
 important?


Because
 you
 need
 to
 see
 the
 reality
 from


different
 angle.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 have
 a


clear
 picture
 of
 the
 reality
 you
 need
 to


see
 from
 different
 angles.
 I
 mean
 if
 you


see
 an
 object
 like
 this
 is
 the
 same
 from


your
 point
 of
 view
 but
 the
 company
 is


not
 so
 symmetric.
 It's
 very
 asymmetric.


So
 you
 needed
 to
 have
 different
 point
 of


view
 from
 different
 people
 and
 for
 me
 it


was
 very
 easy.
 I
 mean
 without
 their


input


without
 really
 their
 insight
 I
 don't


think
 I
 would
 have
 been
 able
 to
 to
 lead


the
 company
 with
 the
 team
 in
 this
 way.


How
 would
 you
 if
 you
 were
 to
 describe


your
 management
 style?
 What
 would
 you


say?
 I
 would
 say
 that
 I
 have


a
 very
 direct.
 I
 am
 maybe
 scientific
 in


the
 sense
 that
 uh
 I
 go
 in
 a
 meeting
 and


I
 like
 to
 hear
 what
 the
 people
 tell
 me.


If
 I
 have
 my
 point
 of
 view
 and
 they


demonstrate
 my
 point
 of
 view
 is
 wrong,
 I


I
 don't
 have
 any
 problem
 to
 change


it.
 I
 would
 say
 that
 this
 is
 the
 feature


that
 the
 people
 uh
 at
 least
 to
 what
 they


tell
 me
 they
 like
 they
 don't
 you
 know
 I


would
 say
 more
 really
 scientific.
 I
 do


not
 enter
 meeting
 with
 my
 point
 of
 view


that
 is
 already
 nailed
 down
 carved
 out.


I
 mean
 I
 would
 like
 to
 I
 like


to
 to
 dance
 with
 the
 people.
 Allow
 me
 to


say
 so
 I
 have
 my
 point
 of
 view.
 You
 have


a
 point
 of
 view.
 Let's
 discuss.
 Let's


see
 which
 are
 the
 fact.
 You're
 a
 good


dancer.
 No
 my
 wife
 is
 telling
 me
 I'm
 not


a
 good
 dancer.
 That's
 okay.


Um
 how
 do
 you
 get
 your
 ideas
 across
 in


the
 organization?
 How
 do
 I
 get
 ideas?


Because
 you
 can
 sit
 at
 the
 top
 and
 you


can
 have
 great
 ideas,
 right?
 But
 I
 mean,


how
 do
 you
 get
 uh
 everybody
 in
 your


direction?
 When
 you
 have
 a
 when
 you
 have


people,
 okay,
 when
 you
 have
 people
 and


you
 have
 a
 relation
 with
 those
 people,


you
 discuss
 also
 about
 business
 most
 of


all,
 most
 important,
 you
 discuss
 about


them
 as


people.
 So
 I
 know
 what
 the
 people
 do.
 I


know
 for
 example,
 Yakopo
 is
 the
 son
 of
 a


a
 guy
 that
 was
 born
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago.
 So


I
 keep
 asking
 about
 Yakopo
 or
 I
 keep


asking
 what
 the
 son
 or
 the
 daughter
 is


doing.
 This
 kind
 is
 bringing
 some
 link.


So
 they
 don't
 see
 me
 far
 away.
 They
 see


me
 close.
 So
 but
 doesn't
 help.
 So
 you


all
 live
 in
 the
 same
 village,
 right?
 I


mean
 Marlo
 is
 that
 that
 is
 a
 big


advantage.
 No
 doubt
 that
 is
 a
 big


advantage.
 But
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 it's
 not
 a


village
 by
 the
 way.
 Yeah.
 Don't
 offend


please.


No
 look
 but
 when
 I
 was
 also
 in
 the
 other


company
 my
 people
 were
 spread
 over
 21


location
 and
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 that
 I
 have


the
 same
 link
 that
 I
 have
 Marinelo


Marinelo
 is
 easier
 because
 we
 are
 on
 the


same
 place
 you're
 right
 but
 also
 when
 I


was
 in
 the
 previous
 company
 I
 was


traveling
 like
 hell
 like
 some
 colleague


here
 in
 the
 room
 I
 you
 can
 have
 the
 same


kind
 of
 relation
 I
 have
 some
 friends
 in


some
 in
 Czech
 Republic
 I'm
 regular
 in


touch
 but
 do
 you
 think
 but
 do
 you
 think


being
 Italian
 is
 different.
 I
 mean,
 is


it
 more
 there
 is
 more
 uh
 you
 know
 focus


on
 family,
 friends,


uh
 food?
 Of
 course,
 you
 are
 very
 good
 at


you're
 very
 good
 at
 cutting
 the
 reindeer


by
 the
 way.
 Um
 but
 do
 you
 think
 there
 is


this
 focus
 on
 family
 and
 which
 makes
 it


into
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 is
 a
 matter
 I
 have


a
 lot
 of
 friends.
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of


business
 people
 from
 all
 over
 the
 world


but
 they
 are
 very
 good.
 So,
 so
 what
 is


the
 only
 things
 you
 can
 say
 that
 maybe


some
 some
 for
 some
 Italians
 especially


from
 south
 of


Italy
 they
 may
 have
 the
 advantage
 to
 be


a
 little
 bit
 more
 direct
 but


I
 don't
 know
 not
 more
 direct
 more
 in
 the


human
 relation
 more
 easy
 to
 to
 start
 I


mean
 but
 where
 where
 do
 you
 want
 what


are
 you
 trying
 to
 change
 now
 at
 Ferrari


what
 part
 of
 the
 culture
 are
 you
 working


on
 uh
 I'm
 working
 on
 two


dimension.
 One,
 I
 want
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to


increase
 this
 speed
 because
 I
 still
 need


the
 12
 points
 to
 go
 from
 18
 to
 30.
 I


think
 that
 uh
 I
 am
 identifying
 together


with
 the
 team
 some
 areas
 that
 it
 makes


sense
 for
 us
 to
 delete
 because
 they
 do


not
 add
 value.
 So
 this
 is
 if
 you
 want
 on


the
 process
 side
 on
 the
 on
 the
 on
 the


client
 side
 I
 think
 that
 we
 start
 we


need
 like
 like
 I
 say
 we
 need
 to
 expand


beyond
 the
 classical
 you
 know
 we
 have
 a


lot
 of
 repeaters
 that
 is
 good
 we
 the
 so


you
 mean
 repeaters
 repeat
 client
 that


are
 buying
 the
 same
 the
 same
 client
 that


are
 buying
 cars
 today
 are
 75%
 we
 have


your
 biggest
 Norwegian
 client
 in
 the


audience
 today
 thank
 you
 for
 your
 trust


you
 I
 would
 like
 no
 I
 think
 that
 we
 need


also
 to
 expand
 the
 client
 base
 we
 are


doing
 good
 progress
 because
 40%
 of
 new


client
 are
 younger
 than
 40
 years
 and
 uh


but
 I
 think
 there
 is
 still
 opportunity


here
 and
 I
 think
 we
 need
 to
 do
 some


progress
 also
 in
 the
 experience
 we


provide
 to
 our
 client
 because
 in
 a


luxury
 company
 the
 product
 is
 important


but
 also
 the
 experience
 is
 very


important
 so
 this
 is
 another
 dimension


what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 that
 but


look
 we're
 organizing
 regularly,
 special


event,
 special
 experience
 on
 track,
 on


road
 with
 the
 client.
 In
 the
 next
 few


weeks,
 we
 will
 have
 client
 that
 will


join
 all
 together
 in
 Spain
 or
 in


Patagonia
 driving
 their


Ferrari.
 But
 we
 will
 also
 experience
 of


people
 that
 are
 fun
 of
 driving.
 They
 buy


their
 racing
 uh
 cars
 and
 they're
 fun
 of


driving
 in
 um
 on
 the
 track.
 So
 this
 is


the
 experience
 that
 we
 want
 to
 bring
 on


the
 track
 on
 the
 on
 the
 client.
 M
 m.
 So


um
 last
 question.
 What
 do
 you
 um
 where


do
 you
 see
 where
 do
 you
 think
 Ferrari


will
 be
 in
 10
 years
 time?


What
 I
 think
 uh
 what
 I
 want
 the
 Ferrari


to
 be
 is
 a
 company
 that
 is


faster
 that
 is
 uh
 continues
 to
 be
 more


and
 more


open
 where
 uh
 really
 the
 mutual
 respect


stays
 there
 as
 a
 value
 where
 we
 listen


and
 we
 anticipate
 we
 continue
 to


anticipate
 which
 are
 the
 product
 the


client
 is
 willing
 to
 to
 have
 from
 us.
 So


I
 would
 like
 that
 we
 continue
 to
 do
 and


we
 improve,
 we
 keep
 improving
 in


delivering
 emotion-driven
 innovation.
 No


technology
 push,
 no
 market
 pull,


emotion-driven
 innovation
 because
 only


in
 that
 way
 you
 make
 a
 difference.
 If


you
 wait
 too
 much
 or
 if
 you
 push
 the


technology
 is
 not
 innovation,
 it's


cutting,
 you
 know,
 copy
 and
 paste.
 And


you
 have
 said
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 too


many
 screens.
 No.
 Why?
 There
 are
 a


couple
 of
 them
 already.
 Why
 don't
 Why


don't
 you
 want
 to
 have
 too
 many
 screens


in
 a
 Ferrari?
 Look,
 I
 coming
 from


semiconductor
 companies,
 I
 know
 that
 uh


what
 is
 useful,
 what
 is
 not
 useful
 in
 a


car,
 what
 is
 useful
 for
 the
 client,
 what


is
 useful
 for
 a
 supplier.
 I
 think
 that


screen
 are
 very
 much
 useful
 for
 the


supplier
 more
 than
 for
 the


client.
 Yeah.
 And
 you
 think
 you
 are
 in
 a


Ferrari
 to
 drive,
 not
 to
 watch
 TV.
 I


believe
 Ferrari
 is
 a
 car
 that
 people


like
 to
 drive.
 is
 not
 a
 sofa
 on
 for
 is


not
 a
 mobile
 phone
 on
 for
 is
 not
 a
 data


center
 on
 for
 some
 of
 people
 here


present
 became
 part
 of
 the
 community


thanks
 for
 the
 their
 trust
 and
 uh
 you


will
 have
 you
 will
 continue
 to
 have
 fun


when
 driving
 Ferrari
 you
 will
 not
 see


cinema
 very
 good
 thank
