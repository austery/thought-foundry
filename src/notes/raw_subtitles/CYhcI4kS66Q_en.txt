forber
 for


we
 can
 build
 on
 that
 in
 the
 weeks
 to


come
 great
 I'm
 going
 to
 refer
 to
 you


some
 comments
 from
 the
 Washington
 Post


on
 defense
 Cuts
 they're
 reporting
 that


Pete
 Heth
 the
 defense
 secretary
 ordered


senior
 leaders
 at
 the
 Pentagon
 and


throughout
 the
 US
 military
 to
 develop


plans
 for
 cutting
 8%
 from
 the
 defense


budget
 in
 each
 of
 the
 next
 five
 years


are
 you
 aware
 of
 that
 plan
 uh
 I'm
 in


contact
 with
 secretary
 hexit
 and
 we're


working
 very
 closely
 and
 you
 know
 again


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 jump
 the
 gun
 here
 on
 TV


uh
 but
 I
 I
 think
 everything's
 on
 the


table
 and
 can
 things
 work
 more


efficiently
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 defense


budget
 we
 spent
 more
 last
 year
 on
 our


interest
 payments
 than
 defense
 so
 are


you
 hoping
 for
 2025
 to
 spend
 more
 on


defense
 than
 the
 interest
 payments
 uh


well
 it
 would
 depend
 how
 we
 got
 there


too
 the
 does
 defense
 spending
 go
 down
 do


does
 the
 interest
 bill
 go
 down
 we
 we'll


see
 what
 that
 calculus
 is
 got
 to
 focus


on
 tariffs
 too
 Revenue
 raising
 is
 a
 part


of
 that
 story
 reciprocity
 National


Security
 you
 want
 fair
 trade
 I
 think
 we


all
 want
 fair
 trade
 the
 president
 has


discussed
 reciprocal
 tariffs
 he's


mentioned
 the
 Europeans
 also
 offered
 to


drop
 Auto
 tariffs
 could
 we
 start
 there


have
 the
 Europeans
 actually
 made
 that


offer
 can
 you
 confirm
 that
 uh
 I
 haven't


seen
 that
 uh
 but
 it's
 possible
 I
 think


the
 good
 thing
 about
 President
 Trump's


negotiating
 style
 is
 people
 put
 things


that
 were
 they
 not
 on
 the
 table
 before


on
 the
 table
 very
 quickly
 so
 that
 would


be
 reciprocity
 and
 maybe
 negotiating
 but


to
 offset
 the
 tax
 cuts
 where's
 the


revenue
 raising
 so
 there
 there
 could
 be


you
 know
 not
 everyone
 is
 going
 to
 uh


give
 on
 every
 point
 right
 so
 you
 know


the
 the


Europeans
 seemingly
 put
 forward
 very


quickly
 Auto
 tariffs
 but
 the
 not
 not


every
 country
 is
 going
 going
 to
 do
 that


my
 my
 view
 as
 I've
 said
 before
 China
 is


the
 most
 imbalanced
 unbalanced
 economy


and
 the
 history
 of
 the
 world
 and
 they


are
 trying
 to
 export
 their
 way
 out
 of
 uh


what
 is
 a
 very
 serious
 recession
 and
 the


rest
 of
 the
 world
 can't
 do
 that
 they


can't
 dump
 Chinese
 Goods
 they're
 going


to
 have
 to
 rebalance
 their
 economy


so


for
 fore


tariffs
 on
 Chinese
 Goods
 went
 up
 10%
 and


a
 lot
 of
 that
 again
 you
 Mexico
 Canada


China
 that
 was
 in
 response
 to
 the
 fental


crisis
 China's
 the
 only
 one
 though
 that


those
 tariffs
 have
 actually
 stayed
 in


place
 is
 that
 the
 opening
 Salvo
 how
 how


high
 do
 you
 think
 Trump
 wants
 to
 go
 when


it
 comes
 to
 Chinese
 tariffs
 well
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 give
 away
 his
 negotiating
 hand


on
 TV
 I
 I
 I
 do
 have
 my
 first
 call
 with


my
 Chinese
 counterpart
 tomorrow
 morning


so
 I
 look
 forward
 to
 a
 very
 productive


discussion
 what's
 the
 first
 point
 you


want
 to
 bring
 up
 uh
 that
 we
 we
 want
 to


work
 together
 and
 you
 as
 we
 said
 uh
 a


lot
 of
 the
 precursor
 ingredients
 from


fentol
 originate
 in
 China
 so
 we
 really


want
 to
 put
 a
 stop
 to
 that
 very
 quickly


hey
 historically
 there's
 been
 some


currency
 concerns
 with
 regards
 to
 China


as
 well
 in
 the
 conversations
 we
 had
 you


before
 taking
 up
 this
 post
 with
 you
 you


mentioned
 that
 some
 countries
 some


currencies
 are
 undervalued
 is
 China
 one


of
 them
 is
 that
 something
 you'd
 like
 to


remedy
 yeah
 well
 Jonathan
 what
 what
 I


what
 I've
 said
 is
 make
 no
 mistake
 the
 US


still
 has
 a
 strong
 dollar
 policy
 but


that
 does
 not
 mean
 that
 bilaterally


other
 countries
 can
 weaken
 their


currencies
 versus
 the
 dollar
 or


manipulate
 their
 currencies
 so
 but


specifically
 on
 China
 China's
 very


difficult
 currency
 to
 Value
 because
 I


really
 think
 that
 when
 we
 think
 about


the
 the
 value
 of
 the
 R&B
 it's
 in
 three


different
 equilibrium
 you
 know
 on
 any


academic
 model
 uh
 say
 purchasing
 power


parody
 it's
 cheap
 on
 the
 other
 side
 you


have
 1.4
 billion
 people
 who
 are
 subject


to
 Capital
 controls
 and
 they
 want
 to
 get


some
 of
 their
 money
 out
 of
 the
 country


and
 then
 you
 have
 what
 I
 would
 call
 The


X
 Factor
 if
 you
 put
 money
 into
 to
 China


today
 what's
 your
 belief
 that
 you
 will


get
 it
 out
 in
 2
 3
 4
 years
 so
 it's
 very


difficult
 to
 come
 up
 with
 a
 point
 value


of
 the
 currency
 you've
 talked
 about
 the


desire
 to
 have
 a
 strong
 dollar
 policy


for
 the
 United
 States
 but
 is
 a
 strong


dollar
 at
 odds
 with
 the
 idea
 of
 bringing


industrial
 production
 back
 to
 the
 United


States
 and
 sort
 of
 speaks
 to
 some
 of
 the


concerns
 about
 other
 countries
 trying
 to


devalue
 their
 currencies
 well
 I
 I
 think


that
 we
 will
 the
 necessarily
 have
 a


strong
 dollar
 if
 we
 run
 good
 policies


and
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 run
 good


policies
 if
 the
 we
 if
 if
 we
 cut
 the


trade
 deficits
 when
 you
 when
 you
 think


about
 the
 trade
 deficit
 is
 a
 combination


of
 terms
 of
 trade
 value
 of
 the
 dollar


and
 our
 own
 budget
 deficit
 so
 if
 we


bring
 down
 the
 the
 budget
 deficit
 then


you
 know
 I
 think


everyone
 if
 we
 are
 deregulating
 if
 we


are
 if
 we
 make
 the
 tax
 cuts
 permanent
 if


we
 make
 the
 us
 more
 B
 business
 friendly


then
 the
 everyone
 the
 you
 know
 all
 the


reserve
 managers
 in
 the
 world
 all
 the


private
 investors
 are
 going
 to
 want
 a


piece
 of
 that
 and
 the
 dollar
 will
 be


strong
 but
 you
 we
 will
 be
 able
 to
 uh


push
 back
 on
 that
 the
 through
 uh
 good


policies
 through
 productivity
 you
 know


the
 you
 the
 US
 productivity
 I
 think
 that


I've
 been
 meeting
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 tech


leaders
 lately
 and
 I
 think
 we
 are
 very


close
 to
 the
 cusp
 of
 this
 AI
 finally


coming
 into
 the
 productivity
 numbers
 do


you
 think
 that
 a
 strong
 dollar
 is


necessary
 in
 order
 to
 offset
 some
 of
 the


cost
 that
 could
 be
 otherwise
 associated


with
 the
 tariffs
 uh
 traditional
 economic


theory
 would
 tell
 you
 that
 the
 dollar


strengthens
 on
 the
 tariffs
 but
 you
 know


who
 knows
 what
 we've
 already
 seen
 since


the
 the
 dollar
 appreciation
 since


November
 5th
 you
 know
 markets
 live
 in


the
 future
 so
 have
 we
 already
 priced
 in


some
 of
 that
 and
 on
 the
 other
 side
 what


we
 are
 trying
 to
 do
 is
 to
 get
 other


economies
 to
 successfully


rebalance
 my
 my
 conversation
 tomorrow
 uh


with
 my
 and
 this
 is
 really
 just
 an


introductory
 uh
 conversation
 but
 as
 we


go
 down
 the
 road
 the
 Chinese
 need
 to


rebalance
 their
 economy
 in
 favor
 of


consumption
 that
 they
 are
 suppressing


the
 consumer
 in
 favor
 of
 the
 business


community
 so
 you
 know
 as
 that
 happens


then
 they
 will
 increase
 their
 demand


same
 thing
 in
 Europe
 you
 know
 Mario


drogy
 for
 any
 any
 of
 your
 viewers
 who


didn't
 see
 it
 Mario
 Drogi
 had
 a


fantastic
 editorial
 uh
 this
 weekend
 in


the
 financial
 times
 where
 he
 said
 look


we
 have
 put
 the
 equivalent
 of
 more


terrorists
 on
 ourselves
 more
 terorists


on
 ourselves
 than
 the
 us
 could
 ever


contemplate
 so
 could
 could
 you
 get
 a


very
 strong
 Euro
 somehow
 they
 had
 an
 an


Immaculate
 deregulation
 just
 quickly


you're
 having
 this
 call
 with
 your


Chinese
 counterpart
 will
 you
 see
 him


next
 week
 at
 the
 G20
 Finance
 Minister's


meeting
 uh
 I
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 Cape
 Town


due
 to
 some
 domestic
 considerations
 uh
 I


actually
 think
 that
 he's
 not
 attending


either
 so
 think
 is
 that
 what
 he's
 told


you
 uh
 this
 is
 the
 the
 readout
 that


we've
 gotten
 okay
 so
 um
 and
 again
 uh
 I
 I


also
 believe
 uh
 several
 of
 my
 other


counterparts
 won't
 be
 there
 I
 I
 have


been
 speaking
 and
 in
 contact
 with
 them


regularly
 and
 then
 I
 will
 be
 seeing
 them


at
 the
 spring
 IMF
 World
 Bank
 meetings
 in


DC
 for


B
 for


for


wanted
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 about
 National


Security
 as
 well
 and
 the
 dollar
 has


certainly
 got
 a
 role
 to
 play
 on
 that


front
 the
 sanctions
 policy
 of
 the
 United


States
 as
 we
 look
 back
 do
 you
 think


that's
 been
 misused
 abused
 yeah


excellent
 question
 Jonathan
 uh
 that
 when


when
 I
 I
 came
 into
 treasury
 if
 you
 think


about
 sort
 of
 Treasury
 is
 five
 five


pieces
 there's
 IRS
 on
 one
 side
 the
 me
 on


the
 other
 but
 you
 know
 the
 main
 focus
 of


in
 the
 building
 at
 treasury
 is
 domestic


Finance
 international
 finance
 that's


what
 I've
 been
 doing
 for
 my
 career
 for


35
 years
 I
 was
 able
 to
 hit
 the
 ground


running
 on
 that
 uh
 the
 what
 we
 call
 TFI


terrorism
 Finance
 uh
 is
 where
 my
 biggest


learning
 curve
 is
 so
 I'm
 spending
 a
 lot


of
 time
 on
 that
 and
 I'm
 reviewing
 the


sanctions
 policies
 why
 do
 we
 do
 what
 we


do
 have
 they
 been
 effective
 are
 we


running
 a
 21st
 century
 program
 as


opposed
 to
 some
 outdated
 modalities
 well


the
 current
 sanctions
 are
 in
 place
 on


places
 like
 Russia
 to
 try
 to
 get
 Putin


to
 negotiating
 table
 you
 are
 intricately


involved
 in
 these
 in
 this
 deal
 you
 were


just
 in
 ke
 you
 met
 with
 President


zalinski
 Trump
 yesterday
 called
 zalinski


a
 dictator
 without
 these
 elections
 and


said
 that
 he
 better
 move
 fast
 or
 he's


not
 going
 to
 have
 a
 country
 left
 does


this
 language
 make
 it
 harder
 for
 you
 to


get
 that
 minerals
 deal
 over
 the
 Finish


Line
 well
 look
 I
 I
 I
 think
 president


zalinski


unfortunately
 uh
 escalated
 and
 has
 put


some
 daylight
 between
 did
 he
 escalate


the
 that
 the
 a
 lot
 of
 his
 remarks
 in


Munich
 uh
 I
 I
 thought
 were
 inappropriate


uh
 president
 zalinsky
 when
 I
 I
 met
 with


him
 uh
 assured
 me
 that
 he'd
 be
 the


signing
 the
 minerals
 deal
 in
 mic
 he
 has


not
 um
 and
 look
 the
 the
 real
 purpose


here
 and
 I
 think
 get
 turned
 into
 kind
 of


this
 media
 circus
 that
 President
 Trump


had
 a
 very
 elegant
 plan
 and
 it
 was
 bring


the
 ukrainians
 closer
 to
 the
 US
 let's
 do


this
 economic
 deal
 and
 the
 even
 Carl
 Ro


in
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 this
 morning


approves
 of
 it
 that
 the
 the
 US
 with


greater
 economic
 interest
 in
 Ukraine


provides
 a
 security
 Shield
 so
 the
 the


sequencing
 of
 what
 was
 going
 to
 happen


was
 bring
 the
 ukrainians
 closer
 to
 the


US
 uh
 through
 economic
 ties
 convince
 the


American
 people
 and
 the
 American
 public


get
 them
 on
 side
 and
 then
 uh
 tell
 the


Russians
 go
 to
 the
 negotiating
 table


with
 a
 very
 folsome
 message
 that
 if
 we


need
 to
 we
 will
 take
 sanctions
 up
 well


what
 about
 tapping
 the
 Russian
 frozen


assets
 some
 $300
 billion
 would
 you
 force


your
 European
 counterparts
 to
 not
 just


have
 them
 Frozen
 but
 actually
 tap
 them


Trump
 talks
 about
 repaying
 the
 American


taxpayer
 shouldn't
 Russia
 be
 a
 part
 of


that
 well
 what
 what's
 happening
 now
 is


they
 are
 they
 are
 being
 tapped
 so
 the


returns
 from
 interest
 the
 the
 the


returns
 from
 the
 freezed
 asset
 pile
 the


is
 going
 to
 pay
 the
 Europeans
 you
 know


what
 what's
 very
 important
 to
 understand


here
 is
 everything
 the
 US
 has
 done
 to


date
 that
 the
 American
 people
 the


American
 taxpayer
 is
 Grants
 the


Europeans
 roughly
 half
 of
 what
 they've


done
 are
 loans
 and
 the
 uh
 runoff
 from


the
 frozen
 assets
 is
 being
 used
 to
 repay


European
 loans
 Have
 you
 communicated


that
 to
 the
 Europeans
 that
 you
 represent


with
 them
 what's
 that
 have
 you


communicated
 the
 Europeans
 that
 you
 repr


sent
 with
 them
 I
 I
 I
 think
 vice


president
 Vance
 did
 a
 pretty
 good
 job
 in


M
 do
 you
 think
 they
 understand
 that
 the


United
 States
 is
 running
 a
 deficit
 of


north
 of
 6%
 close
 to
 7%
 and
 that
 the


budget
 for
 defense
 is
 north
 of
 $800


billion
 do
 they
 think
 do
 you
 think
 they


understand
 the
 gravity
 of
 the
 moment
 in


the
 United
 States
 the
 US
 perspective


look
 I
 I
 I
 think
 that
 they
 they


understand
 that
 uh
 president
 Trump


during
 his
 first
 term
 this
 term
 uh
 vice


president
 Vance
 uh
 and
 the
 entire


security
 apparat
 have
 told
 them
 that


many
 of
 the
 countries
 are
 deficient
 in


their
 NATO
 spending
 and
 they
 need
 to


come
 up
 you
 know
 when
 when
 I
 went
 to


Ukraine
 you
 fly
 into
 Poland
 Poland
 is


spending
 almost
 5%
 of
 GDP
 on
 defense
 and


look
 at
 Poland
 sitting
 next
 to
 Ukraine


Poland
 is
 one
 of
 the
 great
 economic


success
 stories
 of
 the
 past
 30
 years


after
 China
 they've
 had
 the
 fastest


growth
 so
 you
 why
 couldn't
 Ukraine
 with


the
 some
 US
 capital
 Ingenuity
 knowhow


and
 root
 out
 some
 of
 the
 corruption
 do


as
 well
 as
 their
 neighbors
 done
 if


Europe
 spends
 more
 will
 it
 allow
 America


to
 come
 back
 on
 defense
 spending
 is
 that


the
 ultimate
 goal
 uh
 the
 the
 ultimate


goal
 is
 for
 the
 the
 Europeans
 to
 uh
 come


up
 to
 where
 they've
 said
 that
 they
 are


going
 to
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 to
 provide
 uh


their
 share
 of
 the
 NATO
 spending
 you


mentioned
 sanctions
 so
 do
 you
 have
 both


on
 the
 table
 ready
 to
 go
 a
 sanctions


ramp
 up
 or
 wind
 down
 on
 Russia
 depending


how
 these
 talks
 go
 I
 I
 think
 that'd
 be
 a


very
 good


characterization
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the


talks
 Trump
 still
 thinks
 he's
 going
 to


meet
 with
 Putin
 he
 said
 probably
 by
 the


end
 of
 the
 month
 the
 end
 of
 the
 month
 is


next
 week
 are
 you
 preparing
 for
 that
 uh


I
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 give
 give
 away
 the


timetable
 uh
 but
 the
 the
 the
 president


is
 committed
 to
 ending
 this
 conflict


very
 quickly
 and
 I'll
 tell
 you
 you


you're
 in
 keev
 I
 went
 to
 a
 children's


hospital
 that
 had
 been
 bombed
 and
 this


was
 not
 a
 children's
 hospital
 where
 you


take
 your
 child
 if
 he
 or
 she
 scrapes


their
 like
 the
 the
 this
 was
 so
 you
 can


imagine
 I
 I
 did
 that
 trip
 that
 you're


talking
 about
 just
 a
 few
 months
 ago
 you


can
 imagine
 why
 they
 haven't
 had


elections
 in
 right
 they're
 living
 in


this
 martial
 law
 uh
 they
 they
 are
 um
 and


um
 it's
 probably
 a
 a


necessary
 probably
 necessary
 to
 move


forward
 with
 the
 Democratic
 process


CE


Sam
 we've
 covered
 a
 lot
 of
 topics
 one


name
 that
 has
 not
 come
 up
 very
 much
 is


Elon
 Musk
 let's
 finish
 there
 you've
 had


some
 tremendous
 colleag


in
 your
 experience
 over
 your
 career


including
 the
 great
 investor
 stany
 draam


Miller
 youve
 worked
 alongside
 Donald


Trump
 through
 the
 campaign
 can
 you
 just


describe
 what
 it's
 like
 to
 work
 with


someone
 like
 Elon
 Musk
 someone
 as


successful
 in
 American
 Business
 just


what's
 that
 like
 day
 today
 yeah
 look
 you


know
 Elon
 Musk
 like
 Stan
 dren
 Miller


like
 I
 I
 I
 always
 compare
 they
 great


business
 people
 to
 great
 athletes
 they


keep
 their
 eye
 on
 the
 prize
 you
 know


whether
 that
 he
 whether
 he's
 the
 um


Messi
 or
 or
 Michael
 the
 Messi
 or
 Michael


Jordan
 uh
 he
 is
 focused
 and
 his
 energy


levels
 unbelievable
 and
 you
 he's
 gotten


to
 where
 he
 has
 because
 everything's
 on


the
 table
 like
 there
 there's
 always
 this


examination
 of
 why
 are
 we
 doing
 it
 this


way
 why
 are
 we
 doing
 what
 we're
 doing


and
 most
 of
 all
 you
 know
 if
 something's


not
 working
 let's
 fix
 it
 you
 know
 Sam


ultman
 was
 on
 Bloomberg
 TV
 just
 two


weeks
 ago
 and
 called
 Elon
 Musk
 insecure


do
 you
 view
 him
 as
 such
 uh
 I
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 get
 into
 the
 uh
 Tech
 magnet
 the


the
 uh
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 uh
 slap
 F
 cly


Besson
 I
 would
 say
 that's
 wise
 he
 is


drawing
 criticism
 though
 when
 you
 in
 the


administration
 come
 out
 and
 pick
 out
 the


various
 things
 where
 money
 is
 being


wasted
 on
 I
 think
 we
 can
 all
 agree
 that


that's
 a
 waste
 of
 money
 where
 there


might
 be
 some
 concern
 is
 the
 way
 that


some
 people
 are
 being
 laid
 off
 in


Washington
 that
 it
 lacks
 some
 dignity


could
 you
 comment
 on
 that
 today
 look
 I
 I


I
 think
 that
 uh


Tax
 Act
 is
 designed
 to
 help
 you
 get
 your


taxes
 done
 let's
 get
 them
 over


with
 there
 many
 fine
 public
 servants
 and


but
 I
 think
 that
 in
 I
 I've
 been
 in


Washington
 three
 or
 four
 weeks
 now
 and


there
 there's
 a
 real
 bias
 towards
 the


status
 quo
 and
 if
 you
 don't
 move
 quickly


then
 the
 then
 the
 lobbyists
 get
 involved


the
 entrenched
 interest
 and
 and
 it's


impossible
 to
 get
 anything
 done
 so
 you


know
 any
 anyone
 who
 has
 experienced
 uh


financial
 hardship
 the
 any
 kind
 of
 the


uh
 mental
 duress
 uh
 you
 know
 I'm
 sorry


for
 them
 but
 that's
 also
 what
 the


average
 American
 experiences
 every
 day


most
 of
 us
 you
 know
 you
 all
 come
 to
 work


you
 want
 good
 ratings
 The
 you
 know
 you


uh
 the
 you
 you
 get
 a
 performance
 readout


you
 really
 push
 forward
 and
 I
 I
 can
 tell


you
 that
 in
 treasury
 I
 have
 been
 so


impressed
 with
 the
 quality
 of
 the


permanent
 staff
 and
 I
 um
 I
 want
 to
 get


everybody
 back
 to
 the
 office
 and
 a
 lot


lot
 of
 people
 are
 on
 board
 with
 that


when
 it
 comes
 to
 your
 prior
 life
 you


didn't
 have
 a
 boss
 you
 said
 it
 would
 be


like
 atrophy
 if
 you
 weren't
 trading


financial
 markets
 every
 single
 day
 what


is
 it
 like
 now
 to
 be
 in
 this
 position


where
 you
 make
 decisions
 that
 people
 can


trade
 against
 what
 you're
 doing
 and
 you


also
 have
 a
 boss
 that
 sits
 pretty
 close


to
 you
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 Treasury


Department
 and
 The
 West
 Wing
 well
 look
 I


I
 I
 only
 had
 my
 own
 firm
 for
 eight
 years


so
 I
 I
 I
 worked
 with
 Mr
 Soros
 with
 Stan


dren
 Miller
 and
 uh
 it's
 it's
 a
 great


feedback
 mechanism
 and
 I
 I
 think
 I
 have


the
 best
 position
 in
 in
 DC
 I'm
 on
 on
 the


White
 House
 Camp
 campus
 uh
 we
 have
 a


great
 staff
 in
 Treasury
 I
 can
 be
 in
 the


oval
 in
 4
 minutes
 and
 um
 so
 the
 there


there's
 proximity
 and
 um
 again
 not
 like


Elon
 Musk
 pres
 president
 Trump
 is


committed
 to
 shaking
 up
 the
 status
 quo


he
 came
 in
 with
 a
 mandate
 and
 he's


moving
 on
 it
 very
 quickly
 you're
 a
 total


gentleman
 and
 you've
 been
 very
 gracious


with
 your
 time
 thanks
 for
 being
 a
 good


friend
 to
 this
 program
 over
 the
 last


year
 secretary
 Besson
 there
 of
 the


treasury
