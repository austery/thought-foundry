This
 is
 the
 Bloomberg
 Daybreak
 Europe


podcast.
 Good
 morning.
 It's
 Tuesday
 the


14th
 of
 October.
 I'm
 Steven
 Carowell
 in


Brussels.
 Coming
 up
 today,
 Donald
 Trump


signs
 his
 Gaza
 truce
 deal
 to


international
 acclaim,
 but
 establishing


a
 lasting
 peace
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 still


looks
 difficult.
 The
 US
 and
 China


ratchet
 up
 trade
 tensions
 with
 tit


fortat
 measures
 targeting
 the
 shipping


industry.
 Plus
 playing
 catchup
 on
 AI.


Europe
 striving
 to
 claim
 a
 piece
 of
 the


global
 tech
 boom,
 but
 remains
 dependent


on
 American
 firms
 like
 Nvidia
 and
 Open


AI.
 Let's
 start
 with
 a
 roundup
 of
 our


top
 stories.
 World
 leaders
 signed
 a
 Gaza


ceasefire
 agreement
 brokered
 by
 US


President
 Donald
 Trump
 who
 hailed
 it
 as


the
 historic
 dawn
 of
 a
 new
 Middle
 East.


There
 were
 emotional
 scenes
 in
 Israel


where
 families
 were
 reunited
 with


hostages
 who
 were
 taken
 by
 Hamas
 during


its
 October
 7th
 attack
 two
 years
 ago.


Their
 release,
 along
 with
 the
 freeing
 of


Palestinian
 prisoners,
 marks
 the


successful
 first
 phase
 of
 the
 US
 plan
 to


end
 the
 war.
 President
 Trump
 described


it
 as
 an
 achievement
 3,000
 years
 in
 the


making.


>> For
 so
 many
 families
 across
 this
 land,


it
 has
 been
 years
 since
 you've
 known
 a


single
 day
 of
 true
 peace.
 But
 now
 at


last
 Israelis,
 but
 also
 for
 Palestinians


and
 for
 many
 others,
 the
 long
 and


painful
 nightmare
 is
 finally
 over.


>> Even
 Trump's
 critics
 and
 political


opponents
 agreed
 he
 had
 succeeded
 where


others
 had
 failed,
 although
 some


questioned
 his
 rhetoric.
 Many
 others


still
 have
 concerns
 about
 how
 the
 plan


will
 work
 out
 in
 the
 long
 term.


Officials
 have
 yet
 to
 lay
 out
 a
 clear


plan
 for
 disarming
 Hamas
 or
 how
 to
 fund


the
 colossal
 task
 of
 rebuilding
 Gaza.


There
 are
 also
 questions
 over
 who
 will


run
 the
 territory
 which
 is
 home
 to
 2.2


million
 people
 almost
 all
 of
 whom
 have


been
 displaced
 by
 the
 war.


China
 has
 imposed
 curbs
 on
 five
 units
 of


Hanoa
 Ocean
 in
 response
 to
 US
 probes


against
 Chinese
 maritime
 logistics
 and


ship
 building.
 That's
 according
 to
 a


statement
 from
 the
 Chinese
 Ministry
 of


Commerce.
 It's
 the
 latest
 escalation


between
 the
 two
 countries
 are
 trying
 to


claim
 they
 are
 winning
 their
 trade
 war.


Both
 countries
 now
 say
 the
 ball
 is
 in


the
 other's
 court
 to
 compromise.


Speaking
 yesterday,
 US
 Treasury


Secretary
 Scott
 Bessant
 says
 his


administration
 won't
 back
 down.


>> This
 is
 China
 versus
 the
 world.
 They


have
 pointed
 a
 bazooka
 at
 the
 supply


chains
 and
 the
 industrial
 base
 of
 the


entire
 free
 world
 and
 you
 know
 we're
 not


going
 to
 have
 it.


>> Scott
 Besson
 speaking
 there
 despite
 his


stance.
 He
 also
 said
 he
 believes
 a


planned
 Trump
 Xi
 meeting
 will
 still
 be


on,
 noting
 substantial
 communication


over
 the
 weekend.
 Elsewhere,
 smaller


economies
 are
 adapting
 to
 a
 world
 where


US
 consumers
 and
 companies
 are
 costlier


to
 reach
 by
 seeking
 buyers
 in
 Asia,


Europe,
 and
 Africa.
 The
 World
 Trade


Organization
 has
 revised
 its
 forecast


for
 merchandise
 trade
 growth
 in
 2025


from
 0.9%


to
 2.4%
 4%
 as
 governments
 redraw


alliances.


The
 Philadelphia
 Fed
 President
 Hannah


Pollson
 has
 signaled
 she's
 in
 favor
 of


two
 more
 quarter
 point
 interest
 rate


cuts
 this
 year.
 Speaking
 at
 the
 National


Association
 for
 Business
 Economics


annual
 conference,
 the
 policy
 maker
 said


she
 doesn't
 see
 conditions
 that
 would


turn
 tariff
 induced
 price
 increases
 into


sustained
 inflation.
 My
 base
 case
 is


that
 tariffs
 will
 increase
 the
 price


level
 but
 they
 won't
 leave
 a
 lasting


imprint
 on
 inflation.
 And
 given
 this


base
 case,
 monetary
 policy
 should
 look


through
 tariff
 effects
 on
 prices.
 Why?


Let
 me
 start
 with
 the
 economics
 here.


The
 lessons
 from
 economic
 theory
 are


clear.
 So
 long
 as
 expectations
 are


anchored,
 increases
 in
 prices
 due
 to


supply
 effects
 do
 not
 turn
 into
 an


inflation
 problem.


The
 Fed's
 Anna
 Pollson
 speaking
 there.


She
 went
 on
 to
 say
 the
 policy
 makers


decision
 to
 cut
 interest
 rates
 by
 a


quarter
 percentage
 point
 last
 month
 made


sense.
 Though
 a
 narrow
 majority
 of
 FOMC


members
 favor
 at
 least
 two
 more
 cuts


this
 year,
 others
 have
 argued
 for
 a


cautious
 approach
 as
 inflation
 remains


above
 their
 2%
 goal.


Bank
 of
 England
 policy
 maker
 Katherine


Mann
 says
 Brexit
 and
 Liz
 Truss
 have
 made


the
 UK
 a
 less
 competitive
 and
 slower


growing
 economy.
 Speaking
 at
 a


conference
 in
 Philadelphia,
 the
 central


banker
 said
 the
 UK's
 vote
 to
 leave
 the


European
 Union
 was
 one
 step
 in
 a
 long


erosion
 of
 sterling
 as
 a
 global


currency.
 She
 added
 that
 the


implications
 of
 Brexit
 meant
 the
 quote


supply
 side
 of
 the
 economy
 for
 the
 UK
 is


a
 real
 challenge.
 man
 had
 voted
 to
 hold


interest
 rates
 at
 the
 last
 two
 BOE


meetings
 in
 an
 effort
 to
 shrink


inflation
 which
 at
 3.8%
 is
 almost
 double


the
 bank's
 2%
 target.


Silver
 prices
 have
 reached
 an
 all-time


high
 as
 traders
 drive
 a
 supply
 shortage.


Spot
 prices
 for
 the
 precious
 metal


traded
 near
 $53
 an
 ounce,
 beating
 a


record
 set
 in
 the
 1980s.
 Concerns
 about


a
 lack
 of
 liquidity
 in
 London
 have
 led


some
 traders
 to
 fly
 bars
 across
 the


Atlantic
 to
 profit
 from
 higher
 prices.


The
 squeeze
 comes
 as
 investors
 globally


look
 for
 safe
 havens
 with
 gold
 also


climbing
 to
 another
 record
 high,


building
 on
 eight
 straight
 weeks
 of


gains.


And
 SpaceX's
 Starship
 successfully


lifted
 off
 for
 space
 on
 Monday
 in
 a


closely
 watched
 test
 of
 its
 ability
 to


deploy
 satellites
 and
 return
 to
 Earth


intact.
 The
 rocket
 build
 as
 the
 largest


and
 most
 powerful
 ever
 built,
 completed


earlier
 milestones
 critical
 to
 CEO
 Elon


Musk's
 aim
 of
 preparing
 it
 for
 regular


missions
 into
 orbit
 and
 beyond.
 Let's


take
 a
 listen
 to
 the
 moment
 it
 launched


from
 the
 Starbase
 facility
 in
 South


Texas.


>> 3
 2
 1


We
 have
 liftoff.
 Go
 Super
 Heavy.
 Go


Starship.
 Thanks
 for
 all
 the
 historic


flights,
 bad
 one.


>> Minutes
 later,
 the
 Starship
 Superheavy


booster
 split
 from
 the
 spacecraft
 as


planned
 before
 splashing
 down
 at
 the


Gulf
 of
 Mexico.
 The
 success
 marks
 a
 step


forward
 in
 Musk's
 ambitions
 to
 carry


NASA
 astronauts
 to
 the
 moon
 in
 under
 two


years
 and
 eventually
 establish


civilization
 on
 Mars.
 Well,
 those
 are


your
 top
 stories.
 On
 the
 markets,
 we're


looking
 at
 European
 stock
 futures
 lower


210
 and
 Euro
 stocks
 50
 this
 morning.
 The


Nikki
 and
 Tokyo
 down
 by
 2.6%.
 6%
 the


topics
 down
 by
 2.2%
 those
 markets


catching
 up
 after
 being
 closed


yesterday.
 The
 hang
 though
 in
 Hong
 Kong


is
 down
 by
 1%
 as
 well.
 So
 trades
 uh


movements
 there
 having
 some
 effect
 on


markets.
 Gold
 and
 silver
 we've
 been


telling
 you
 about
 both
 significantly


rallying
 today.
 Gold's
 up
 1.6%.
 Silver's


up
 1.9%
 as
 well.
 The
 Bloomberg
 Dollar


Spot
 index
 a
 tenth
 of
 1%
 weaker
 and


stock
 futures
 on
 Wall
 Street
 at
 the


moment
 are
 lower
 to
 410
 lower
 for
 S&P
 E-


Mini
 futures.
 In
 a
 moment,
 we'll
 bring


you
 more
 on
 events
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.


Plus,
 can
 Europe
 catch
 up
 in
 the
 AI


race?
 But
 another
 story
 that
 I've
 been


reading
 this
 morning
 about
 how
 the
 crash


in
 cryptocurrencies
 played
 out
 over
 the


weekend.
 So,
 some
 of
 those
 US
 China


trade
 headlines
 on
 Friday,
 sparking
 a


sell-off
 across
 many
 asset
 classes.
 But,


Bitcoin
 plunged
 around
 13%
 after
 those


tensions
 spiked.
 Bloomberg's
 Alga
 Karif


though
 has
 been
 writing
 about
 how
 the


slump
 was
 much
 steeper
 in
 the
 altcoin


market
 which
 are
 these
 as
 she
 described


them
 ecosystems
 of
 speculative
 tokens


that
 have
 promised
 generational
 wealth


through
 viral
 memes,
 bigname
 branding


and
 blind
 faith
 in
 momentum.
 Well,
 it


seems
 that
 blind
 faith
 wasn't
 very
 well


placed
 when
 we
 look
 at
 the
 131
 billion


in
 value
 erased
 from
 those
 altcoins.


That's
 according
 to
 10x
 research.
 Now


this
 is
 a
 sector
 built
 on
 thinner
 than


liquidity,
 speculative
 narratives
 and


hype.
 So
 it
 is
 more
 vulnerable
 to
 bigger


swings.
 But
 August
 writing
 that
 the


crash
 raises
 doubts
 about
 the
 future
 of


this
 whole
 ecosystem.
 Traders
 and
 market


makers
 see
 structural
 support
 for
 these


tokens
 now
 eroding
 with
 fewer
 buyers
 and


rising
 risk
 aversion.
 Could
 this
 be
 a


freeze
 for
 niche
 meme
 coins
 like


Dogecoin?
 You

 August

 at


bloomberg.com
 and
 we'll
 put
 a
 link
 to
 it


in
 our
 podcast
 show
 notes.
 to
 the
 Middle


East
 now
 where
 US
 President
 Donald
 Trump


talked
 about
 a
 new
 beginning
 for
 the


region
 after
 the
 release
 of
 Israeli


hostages
 and
 Palestinian
 prisoners
 under


the
 US
 brokered
 ceasefire
 yesterday.
 Our


head
 head
 of
 Middle
 East
 and
 North


Africa
 coverage,
 Stuart
 Livingston


Wallace,
 joins
 me
 now
 for
 more.
 Stuart,


let's
 start
 first
 of
 all
 with
 how


yesterday
 went.
 Was
 this
 a
 big
 success


for
 Donald
 Trump?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it
 was.
 And
 I
 I
 think
 it


would
 be
 mean-spirited
 to
 say
 otherwise.


And
 if
 you
 think
 about
 what
 he
 achieved


that
 certainly
 his
 predecessor
 and
 many


other
 international
 leaders
 had
 failed


to
 achieve
 over
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 which


was
 ultimately
 the
 release
 of
 uh
 the


hostages
 and
 also
 the
 release
 of
 you


know
 a
 couple
 of
 thousand
 Palestinian


detainees
 and
 prisoners.
 Um
 so
 just
 in


terms
 of
 the
 kind
 of
 the
 human
 impact
 it


was
 it
 was
 a
 really
 big
 day
 I
 think
 uh


and
 particularly
 for
 the
 region
 and
 then


to
 get
 that
 many
 leaders
 uh
 and
 I'm


referring
 of
 course
 to
 the
 the
 summit
 in


Sha
 Mashik
 into
 a
 room
 at
 short
 notice
 I


think
 speaks
 volumes
 to
 how


consequential
 those
 actions
 have
 been.


>> Of
 course
 the
 signing
 was
 the
 big
 moment


but
 what
 sort
 of
 plans
 emerged
 from
 that


summit
 in
 Egypt
 about
 what
 happens
 next


in
 Gaza?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 you
 can


look
 at
 this
 two
 ways.
 I
 mean
 I
 think


you
 can
 look
 at
 it
 as
 a
 reminder
 that


there
 is
 an
 awfully
 long
 way
 to
 go
 to


getting
 true
 peace
 uh
 particularly
 in


Gaza,
 but
 I
 would
 you
 know
 argue


arguably
 across
 the
 Middle
 East.
 Uh
 but


on
 the
 other
 hand,
 you
 can
 view
 it
 as


again
 summoning
 and
 successfully


summoning
 that
 many
 leaders
 from
 around


the
 world
 at
 short
 notice
 shows
 uh
 a


degree
 of
 goodwill
 and
 that
 will
 be


absolutely
 essential
 in
 terms
 of


hammering
 out
 the
 details
 of
 what
 Gaza


looks
 like
 going
 forward.
 both
 in
 terms


of
 the
 reconstruction
 and
 who's
 going
 to


pay
 for
 it,
 who's
 going
 to
 provide


personnel
 to
 monitor
 ceasefires
 and
 then


to
 implement
 them.
 And
 then
 finally,
 you


know,
 who's
 going
 to
 be
 involved
 in


formulating
 a
 credible
 governance
 plan


for
 Gaza
 going
 forward


>> in
 the
 immediate,
 what
 should
 we
 be


expecting
 next
 in
 this
 process?
 So
 I


mean
 to
 some
 extent
 now
 the
 hard
 work


begins
 because
 it
 really
 is
 a
 question


of
 hammering
 out
 exactly
 who
 is
 going
 to


take
 responsibility
 for
 what
 because
 I


think
 no
 one
 in
 uh
 with
 you
 know
 who's


been
 observing
 things
 over
 the
 last


couple
 of
 years
 would
 argue
 that
 Heras


is
 in
 any
 position
 to
 to
 resume


governance.
 Uh
 although
 there
 have
 been


early
 indications
 that
 they
 have
 been


trying
 to
 reassert
 control
 but
 I
 think


that's
 a
 non-starter
 for
 just
 about


everyone.
 So
 that
 probably
 means
 some


sort
 of
 international
 coalition
 over
 the


short
 term,
 a
 technocratic
 government
 of


some
 sort,
 hopefully
 with
 a
 strong


Palestinian
 flavor,
 a
 reform
 of
 the


Palestinian
 Authority.
 Uh
 and
 then
 as


you
 rebuild
 those
 uh
 institutions
 across


the
 enclave
 uh
 you
 try
 and
 find
 a
 way
 of


linking
 it
 up
 with
 the
 West
 Bank
 and
 you


try
 and
 find
 a
 way
 of
 bringing
 or


returning
 economic
 prosperity
 because
 I


think
 that
 is
 the
 key
 here
 is
 it
 needs
 a


functioning
 infrastructure
 and
 it
 needs


a
 functioning
 economy
 for
 this
 to
 be


viable
 in
 any
 sort
 of
 time
 frame.


>> What
 does
 all
 of
 this
 mean
 for
 Benjamin


Netanyahu?
 Will
 he
 be
 able
 to
 keep
 a


focus
 on
 security
 issues
 given
 the
 other


controversies
 that
 he
 has
 faced
 in
 his


leadership?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 that's
 an
 extremely
 good


question
 and
 and
 to
 some
 extent
 the


landscape
 has
 shifted.
 I
 mean
 you
 can


point
 to
 a
 couple
 of
 things.
 There
 was


that
 uh
 somewhat
 but
 it
 would
 appear
 uh


off
 the
 cuff
 remark
 from
 Trump
 yesterday


in
 the
 Kasset
 where
 he
 urged
 the
 Israeli


president
 uh
 to
 pardon
 uh
 BB
 uh
 in


relation
 to
 the
 the
 trials
 that
 he's


currently
 going
 under.
 We'll
 see
 whether


that
 happens.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 not
 entirely


unprecedented,
 but
 it
 would
 be
 extremely


unusual.
 That
 would
 remove
 uh
 at
 least


some
 of
 the
 pressure
 on
 him.
 And
 then


it'd
 be
 interesting
 to
 see
 what
 happens


at
 the
 electoral
 level.
 I
 mean,
 up
 until


probably
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 ago,
 I
 think


it
 would
 be
 very
 difficult
 for
 Netanyahu


to
 secure
 a
 win
 in
 a
 future
 election,


which
 has
 to
 take
 place
 by
 October.
 But


you
 do
 wonder
 with
 the
 release
 of
 the


hostages
 and
 and
 the
 seeming
 peace,
 at


least
 for
 now,
 in
 Gaza,
 whether
 his


electoral
 fortunes
 might
 turn
 around.


and
 more
 importantly
 whether
 he
 would


have
 to
 rely
 on
 that
 sort
 of
 hard
 right


members
 of
 his
 coalition
 to
 form
 a


government
 going
 forward.
 So
 I
 think
 you


know
 something
 we're
 going
 to
 be


watching
 over
 the
 next
 few
 months
 very


hard
 to
 predict
 which
 way
 it'll
 go
 but


his
 fortunes
 seem
 marginally
 better
 than


they
 were
 until
 really
 quite
 recently.


Okay,
 Stuart
 Livingston
 Wallace
 who


heads
 up
 our
 coverage
 of
 the
 Middle
 East


and
 North
 Africa.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much


for
 joining
 us.
 Stay
 with
 us.
 More
 from


Bloomberg
 Daybreak
 Europe
 coming
 up


after
 this.
 Now,
 European
 companies
 are


striving
 to
 claim
 a
 piece
 of
 the
 global


AI
 boom,
 but
 they
 remain
 dependent
 on


American
 firms
 like
 Nvidia
 and
 OpenAI.


Across
 the
 continent,
 there
 are
 fears


that
 a
 failure
 to
 invest
 heavily
 in
 AI


locally
 will
 mean
 losing
 talent
 and


abandoning
 yet
 another
 tech
 revolution


to
 Silicon
 Valley.
 Our
 AI
 reporter


Rachel
 Mets
 has
 been
 writing
 about
 this


and
 she
 joins
 us
 now
 for
 more.
 Rachel,


good
 to
 talk
 to
 you.
 What
 did
 you
 hear


then
 about
 these
 fears
 from
 European


policy
 makers
 and
 executives?


I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 concerned


that
 as
 we've
 seen
 in
 the
 past
 there


have
 been
 uh
 case
 after
 case
 where
 in


Europe
 technology
 revolutions
 have
 come


and
 they
 have
 gone
 and
 the
 continent
 and


the
 individual
 countries
 just
 have
 not


really
 been
 in
 charge
 of
 their
 destinies


with
 these
 technologies.
 We've
 seen
 that


with
 mobile
 with
 cloud
 etc.
 Um,
 and
 with


AI,
 I
 think
 people
 really
 want
 to
 be
 in


charge,
 especially
 because
 they
 see
 it


as
 a
 technology
 that
 will
 play
 into
 a


lot
 of
 different
 industries
 and
 could


have
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 impacts.
 It


could
 be,
 uh,
 it's
 necessary
 for
 things


like
 healthcare.
 Um,
 it
 could
 be
 used
 in


defense,
 things
 like
 that.
 Especially,


you
 know,
 when
 you're
 talking
 about


things
 that
 are
 really
 sensitive
 data


wise,
 you
 want
 to
 have
 more
 control
 over


them
 as
 a
 country.


Is
 this
 a
 lack
 of
 investment
 that's
 the


source
 of
 this
 or
 is
 it
 just
 simply
 that


the
 drivers
 of
 innovation
 in
 AI
 are
 just


concentrated
 in
 Silicon
 Valley?


>> I
 think
 there's
 a
 few
 different
 things


going
 on
 and
 and
 our
 reporting
 seem
 to


indicate
 that
 that
 that
 there
 are
 a


bunch
 of
 different
 factors
 here.
 You


definitely
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 are


in
 Silicon
 Valley,
 but
 there's
 plenty
 of


talent
 in
 Europe,
 in
 France,
 in
 Germany,


in
 the
 UK,
 in
 many
 other
 countries
 as


well.
 And
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 are


saying,
 "Hey,
 we
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 we


keep
 these
 smart
 people
 that
 we
 have


here.
 They
 have
 people
 going
 through


their
 universities
 and
 they
 want
 to
 keep


keep
 them
 there,
 find
 ways
 to
 keep
 them


there.
 Um
 find
 ways
 to
 make
 it


attractive
 for
 people
 to
 build
 companies


there.
 And
 there
 is
 definitely


investment,
 but
 it's
 true
 that
 it
 is
 a


fraction
 of
 what
 companies
 collectively


in
 the
 US
 are
 investing.
 Um,
 but
 it's


still
 not
 an
 insignificant
 amount
 of


money
 that
 they
 are
 investing
 in
 AI."


This
 reporting
 Rachel
 will
 cause
 a
 lot


of
 hand
 ringing
 in
 Brussels
 where
 I
 am


but
 really
 in
 many
 parts
 of
 Europe
 as


well
 um
 that
 Europe
 wants
 to
 avoid


becoming
 a
 tech
 colony.
 Can
 Europe
 catch


up
 in
 this
 or
 is
 it
 too
 late
 already?


>> I
 think
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 still


to
 be
 done
 is
 what
 it
 seems
 like
 we
 were


finding
 in
 our
 reporting.
 There
 is
 as


you
 me
 you
 mentioned
 investment.
 there's


still
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 that
 needs
 to
 be


invested
 and
 there's
 also
 um
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 thinking
 that
 needs
 to
 be
 done


about
 what
 are
 the
 goals
 here
 and
 what


does
 it
 mean
 to
 have
 sovereign
 AI.
 I


think
 one
 of the
 first
 questions
 we


asked
 each
 person
 we
 interviewed
 was


what
 does
 sovereign
 AI
 mean
 to
 you?
 And


it's
 kind
 of
 a
 squishy
 term
 uh
 that


seems
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 to
 do
 with
 uh


control
 over
 the
 sort
 of
 start
 to
 finish


process
 of
 of
 AI
 and
 uh
 of
 chips
 and
 of


cloud
 services
 and
 of
 the
 models


themselves.
 You
 know,
 where
 they're


operated
 and
 who's
 building
 them
 and


those
 kinds
 of
 things.
 But
 you
 also
 need


to
 be
 realistic
 about
 the
 fact
 that
 you


simply
 can't
 do
 everything
 yourself.


perhaps.
 And
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 number
 of


companies
 that
 are
 trying
 to
 uh
 make


this
 work
 in
 various
 ways.
 It's
 going
 to


be
 really
 interesting
 to
 see
 in
 the


coming
 years
 how
 it
 all
 pans
 out.
