[Music]


thank
 you
 and
 what
 amazing
 advice
 we


have
 all
 been
 the
 beneficiaries
 of
 not


just
 just
 most
 recently
 from
 Adam
 U
 but


this
 morning
 uh
 I
 thought
 I'd
 come
 at


this
 my
 own
 way
 um
 and
 when
 I
 tell
 my


organization
 don't
 be
 defensive
 be


curious
 change
 is
 a


constant
 we


as
 investors
 we
 in
 financial
 services
 I


think
 have
 consistently
 underestimated


the
 impact
 of
 change
 we've
 been


resistant
 to
 change
 we've
 denied
 change


we
 stick
 to
 the
 status
 quo
 and
 I
 thought


I'd
 just
 maybe
 share
 some
 examples
 of


change
 and
 how
 impactful
 it
 is
 so
 this


is
 now
 my
 40th
 year
 doing
 this
 and
 I


tell
 my
 team
 I
 look
 back
 over
 40
 years


and
 when
 I
 started
 no
 highi
 bonds
 no


leverage
 loans
 no
 ETFs
 minimal


securitized
 product
 now
 those
 four


products
 are
 incredibly
 dominant
 in
 our


financial
 landscape
 why
 do
 we
 think


they're
 going
 to
 be
 here
 in
 five
 or
 10


years
 why
 do
 we
 build
 investment


strategies
 on
 them
 are
 the
 circumstances


that
 allowed
 them
 to
 essentially
 take


hold
 still
 the
 circumstances


today
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 look
 back
 again


over
 40
 years
 and
 I
 think
 we've
 lived
 in


a
 period
 of
 Tailwinds
 for
 my
 career
 I


think
 I've
 live
 been
 very
 fortunate
 I


think
 most
 of
 you
 have
 have
 been
 very


fortunate
 we've
 had
 four
 Tailwinds
 rates


have
 gone
 from
 high
 to


low
 we
 have
 printed
 an
 awful
 lot
 of


money
 we
 have
 borrowed
 forward
 future


demand
 through
 fiscal
 borrowing
 almost


everywhere
 in
 the
 world
 and
 we've
 had


the
 benefit
 of


globalization
 are
 any
 of
 those
 four


things


true
 going


forward
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 think
 there's
 a


healthy
 debate
 as
 to
 whether
 they
 are


headwinds
 but
 I
 would
 argue


I
 think
 we're
 in
 the
 absence
 of


Tailwinds
 why
 would
 we
 think
 the


investment
 strategies
 that
 work
 for
 the


past
 40
 years
 would
 work
 going
 forward


is
 there
 actually
 any
 value
 to
 track


record
 over
 the
 last
 10


years
 or
 should
 we
 just
 completely
 throw


it
 away
 we
 all
 as
 investors
 take
 great


comfort
 of
 looking
 at
 the
 Last
 5
 Years


the
 last
 10
 years
 what
 are
 the
 chances


that
 we're
 going
 to
 print
 in
 the
 US


another
 8
 trillion
 do
 and
 everything


will
 go
 up
 to
 the
 right


why
 would
 track
 record
 be
 relevant
 you


know
 I
 think
 a
 healthy
 skepticism
 you


were
 in
 2019
 the
 best
 investor
 in
 the


world
 you
 left
 Norway
 and
 you
 moved
 to


Austin
 Texas
 and
 all
 you
 bought
 in


Austin
 Texas
 was
 multif
 family
 and
 you


bought
 multif
 family
 in
 all
 the
 right


locations
 and
 your
 buildings
 are
 now


100%
 occupied
 your
 rents
 have
 been


growing
 10%
 a
 year
 you
 took
 out
 your
 60%


morgage
 at
 3
 and
 a
 half%
 you
 were


feeling
 great
 you
 were
 the
 best
 investor


in
 the
 world


what's
 your
 Equity
 worth


today
 it's
 a
 math
 problem
 rents
 up
 cap


rates
 up
 your
 Equity
 is
 worth
 50
 cents


on
 the


dollar
 were
 you
 a
 good
 investor
 well
 in


19
 you
 were
 a
 really
 good
 investor
 in
 20


you
 were
 a
 good
 investor
 in
 21
 people


were
 not
 so
 sure
 in
 22
 you
 went
 to
 the


bottom
 of
 the
 B
 and
 in
 23
 people
 are


pretty
 convinced
 you
 were
 lucky
 not


smart
 maybe
 we
 should
 use
 the
 words


Enterprise
 software
 instead
 of
 Austin


Texas
 maybe
 we've
 been
 living
 in


tailwind
 and
 we
 have
 to
 learn
 to
 accept


change
 I
 know
 in
 my
 organization
 a
 lot


of
 the
 things
 that
 Adam
 just
 said
 uh
 we


do
 there's
 active
 encouragement
 of


intellectual
 insubordination
 which
 I


distinguish
 from
 outright


insubordination
 because
 that
 makes
 it


difficult
 to
 run
 the
 business
 but
 there


is
 no
 hierarchy
 for
 a
 good
 idea
 there
 is


no
 ability
 uh
 to
 feel
 uncomfortable
 this


is
 something
 we
 actively
 promote
 um
 I


gathered
 U
 my
 partners
 um
 in
 auu
 in


January
 every
 couple
 of
 years
 we
 get


together
 and
 we
 talk
 about
 the
 future


and
 I
 started
 with
 uh
 Apollo
 in
 2008


Apollo
 in
 2008
 was
 40
 billion
 of


AUM
 Apollo
 in
 2023
 was
 650
 billion
 of


AUM
 we
 out
 grew
 14
 times
 we
 outgrew


Apple
 we
 outgrew
 Microsoft
 I
 think
 we


outgrew
 everyone
 other
 than
 Nidia
 by
 the


way
 all


organic
 next
 question
 were
 we
 lucky
 or


smart
 come
 on
 you
 guys
 know
 this
 we
 were


lucky
 you
 can't
 possibly
 you
 can't


possibly
 expect
 to
 grow
 a
 financial


services
 business
 at
 14
 times
 we
 were


smart
 only
 in
 that
 we
 were
 in
 the
 right


place
 to
 prepare
 for


Change
 and
 change
 happened
 think
 about


the
 trends
 that
 drove
 us
 from
 40
 billion


of
 AUM
 to
 650
 billion
 of
 AUM
 financial


crisis
 in
 2008
 weakened
 most
 financial


institutions
 they
 were
 playing
 defense


rates
 going
 to
 zero
 pushed
 investors
 who


had
 made
 promises
 to
 retirees
 to
 look


for


Alternatives
 those
 are
 the
 factors
 that


drove
 our
 growth
 and
 so
 sitting
 in
 the


beginning
 of


2024
 I'm
 looking
 out
 and
 I'm
 saying
 to


myself
 what
 where's
 change
 coming
 from


how
 do
 we
 first
 accept
 that
 the
 success


that
 we've
 had
 is
 based
 on
 a
 series
 of


things
 that
 no
 longer
 exist
 how
 do
 we


prepare
 the
 organization
 and
 to
 accept


change
 what
 happens
 if
 we're
 wrong
 I


think
 I'm
 wrong
 at
 least
 40%
 of
 the


time
 which
 would
 make
 me
 in
 baseball


terms
 the
 the
 the
 most
 productive
 player


ever
 well
 let's
 let's
 create
 an


organizational
 culture
 that
 accepts
 that


you
 can


fail
 and
 fix
 your
 mistakes


quickly
 let's
 not
 get
 let's
 not
 fire


people
 from
 making
 bad
 decisions
 let's


fire
 them
 from
 making
 no


decision
 and
 that's
 I
 think
 what
 we've


done
 so
 I
 sit
 out
 and
 I
 I
 think
 about
 uh


what
 the
 team
 said
 this
 morning
 what
 you


heard
 from
 uh
 Wellington
 what
 you
 heard


from
 Helman
 and
 Freeman
 what
 you
 heard


from
 Oak
 Tree
 and
 I
 think
 all
 of
 it
 is


true
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 add
 my
 gloss
 on


top
 of
 it
 I
 think
 we
 as


investors
 are
 not
 mindful
 enough
 of
 the


massive
 change
 taking
 place
 and
 I
 think


some
 of
 the
 change
 is
 predictable
 so


I'll
 give
 you
 how
 we
 are
 building
 our


business
 based
 on
 change
 on
 things
 that


we
 observe


2008
 we
 nearly
 destroyed
 the
 worldwide


Financial
 system
 we
 implemented
 massive


amounts
 of
 change
 none
 of
 us
 me
 included


have
 yet
 to
 experience
 any
 of
 that


change
 because
 right
 after
 we
 changed


the
 rules
 we
 printed
 A8
 trillion
 and


everything
 went
 up
 and
 to
 the
 right


we've
 now
 had
 about
 18
 months
 of
 living


with


change
 so
 what
 could
 we


observe
 easy
 one
 are
 public
 markets


liquid
 I
 don't
 think
 so
 maybe
 on
 the


equity
 side
 that's
 true
 on
 the
 fixed


income
 side
 no
 2008
 put
 an
 extreme


penalty
 on
 Market
 making
 capital
 in


fixed
 income
 in
 particular
 Market
 making


capital
 is
 10%
 of
 what
 it
 was
 today
 of


what
 it
 was
 in
 2008
 markets
 are
 three


times
 their
 size
 yes
 we
 are
 living
 with


a
 30th
 of
 the
 liquidity
 it
 now
 takes
 5


days
 to
 sell
 an
 investment
 grade


corporate
 bond
 outside
 the
 top
 20


we've
 actually
 witnessed
 wholesale


market
 failure
 this
 cute
 little
 thing


called
 ldi
 in
 the
 UK
 this
 was
 not
 some


crazy
 thing
 UK
 institutions
 were
 doing


this
 was
 a
 mistaken
 belief
 that
 they


could
 sell
 AAA
 and
 doublea
 obligations


at
 or
 near
 the
 market
 price
 they
 were


wrong
 they
 started
 selling
 the
 price


collapsed
 Bank
 of
 England
 ultimately
 had


to
 step
 in
 should
 we
 actually
 think
 on
 a


go
 forward
 basis
 that
 this
 is
 the
 norm


that
 liquidity
 only
 exists
 on
 the
 way
 up


it
 does
 not
 exist
 on
 the
 way
 down


why
 do
 we
 want
 to
 be


public
 why
 do
 we
 actually
 distinguish


between
 public
 and


private
 what
 is
 actually
 the
 difference


between
 public
 and
 private
 it's
 not


clear
 to
 me
 that
 there's
 any
 liquidity


difference
 Equity
 is


aside
 second
 big
 fundamental
 change
 2008


most
 of
 the
 regulation
 around
 the
 world


not
 just
 then
 But
 continuing
 to
 today


has
 to
 reduce
 the
 role
 of
 banks
 in
 the


economy
 everywhere
 in
 the
 world
 is
 going


through
 de
 banking
 at
 different
 rates
 in


the
 US
 Banks
 today
 are
 less
 than
 30%
 of


debt


Capital
 investors
 are
 the
 other


percentage
 every
 regulator
 every


government
 everywhere
 in
 the
 world
 has


two
 choices
 Capital
 can
 come
 from
 Banks


or
 Capital
 can
 come
 from
 investors


there's
 no
 third
 choice
 once
 you
 choose


investors
 you
 have
 two
 more
 choices
 they


can
 come
 from
 the
 daily
 liquid
 public


markets
 or
 they
 can
 come
 from


institutional
 private
 markets
 think


about
 the
 priorities
 particular


particularly
 in
 Europe
 energy
 transition


climate
 change
 infrastructure
 everything


I
 just
 mentioned
 is


longterm
 why
 would
 we
 want
 that
 funded


on
 a
 daily
 liquid
 basis
 wouldn't
 we
 want


that
 funded
 in
 institutional
 markets
 to


match


liquidity
 where
 is
 systemic
 risk
 think


about
 why
 banking
 is
 being
 disfavored


banking
 is
 being
 disfavored
 in
 part


because
 Banks
 borrow
 short
 and
 lend


long
 do
 we
 really
 want
 more
 borrow
 short


lend
 long
 by
 using
 more
 public
 markets


or
 do
 we
 want
 private


markets
 this
 whole


rethink
 of
 the
 role
 of
 a
 bank
 the
 role


of
 an
 investor
 is
 a
 massive
 change
 we
 as


investors
 are
 going
 to
 experience


products
 in
 the
 financial
 uh
 excuse
 me


the
 fixed
 income
 space
 that
 we've
 never


seen
 before
 risk
 rewards


products
 returns
 that
 have
 been
 locked


on
 the
 balance
 sheets
 of
 financial


institutions
 for
 the
 last
 40
 years
 are


on
 their
 way
 to
 you
 as
 investment


products


we're
 all
 going
 to
 have
 to
 come
 overcome


biases
 that
 we
 have
 about
 public
 and


private
 other
 big
 change
 indexation
 and


correlation
 do
 we
 have
 price
 Discovery


in
 US


markets
 I
 don't


know
 35%
 of
 uh
 83%
 of
 the
 US
 market
 is


S&P
 500
 10
 stocks
 are
 35%
 of
 the
 S&P


those
 10
 stocks
 trade
 at
 a
 45
 PE
 today


how
 many
 of
 Us
 come
 in
 every
 day
 trying


to
 buy
 45
 PE


stocks
 probably
 none
 on
 the
 other
 hand


think
 of
 the
 largest
 pool
 of
 capital
 in


the
 world
 today12
 trillion
 do
 sitting
 in


401K
 for
 us
 mid-market
 investors
 people


who
 really
 need
 Returns
 what
 are
 these


people
 invested
 in
 Daily
 liquid
 index


funds
 for
 50
 years
 why
 why
 do
 we
 have


people
 invested
 in
 Daily
 liquid
 index


funds
 for
 50
 years
 and
 it'll
 go
 to
 where


I
 think
 change
 is
 really


coming
 we
 are
 going
 through
 an
 entire


evaluation
 of
 public
 versus


private
 in
 my
 40
 years
 I
 certainly
 grew


up
 thinking
 public
 is
 safe
 private
 is


risky
 and
 for
 most
 of
 my
 career
 that's


been
 true
 private
 was
 three
 products


Venture
 Capital
 hedge
 funds
 and
 private


Equity
 all
 three
 are
 risky
 public
 was


safe
 in
 the
 US
 at
 least
 8,000
 public


companies
 Diversified
 portfolios
 of


stocks
 and


bonds
 what
 if
 that's
 not
 the
 case


anymore
 what
 if
 private
 is
 both
 safe
 and


risky
 and
 public
 is
 safe
 and


risky
 how
 should
 we
 think
 about


investing
 how
 should
 we
 think
 about


portfolios
 most
 of
 us
 most
 institutions


operate
 with
 a
 private
 bucket
 or
 an


Alternatives
 bucket
 why
 don't
 you
 have
 a


public
 bucket
 rather
 than
 a
 private


bucket
 Market
 we
 went
 from
 8,000
 public


companies
 in
 the
 US
 to
 4,000
 public


companies
 and
 I
 would
 bet
 that's
 going


to
 go
 down
 not


up
 shouldn't
 we
 have
 half
 our
 money
 in


private
 I
 think
 we've
 looked
 to
 private


markets
 for
 rate
 of
 return
 because
 we've


always
 perceived
 it
 as
 as
 more
 risky


therefore
 more
 return
 is
 desired
 I
 think


we're
 going
 to
 look
 to
 private
 markets


for


diversification
 I
 think
 to
 escape


indexation
 and


concentration
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to


look
 to
 private
 markets
 I
 think
 we're


going
 to
 think
 the
 whole
 no
 rethink
 a


whole
 notion
 of
 risk
 and


reward
 the
 things
 that
 we've
 taken
 for


granted
 that
 public
 is
 safe
 and
 that


private
 is
 risky
 that
 banks
 are
 a
 sort


of
 death
 financing
 that
 daily
 liquid
 by


the
 way
 why
 do
 we
 have
 daily
 liquid


funds
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 does
 an


institution
 with
 a
 20
 or
 40e
 time


Horizon
 concern
 itself
 with


liquidity
 I
 don't
 know
 these
 are
 we
 are


breaking
 taboo
 investors
 right
 now
 are


confused
 and
 they're
 confused
 because


they're
 looking
 back
 at


history
 and
 they're
 saying
 this
 worked


but
 what
 they're
 not
 yet
 willing
 to
 do


is
 to
 question
 the


fundamentals
 is
 the
 system
 totally


different
 have
 things
 changed
 are
 we
 in


the
 absence
 of


Tailwinds
 am
 I
 willing
 to
 revisit


underlying


assumptions
 think
 about
 the
 following


like
 coming
 back
 to
 the
 notion
 of
 price


Discovery
 active
 management
 of
 equity
 is


a
 really
 difficult
 business
 very
 few


people
 do
 it
 really
 well
 have
 the


discipline
 have
 60
 teams
 if
 I
 told
 you


there
 was
 a
 market
 where
 for
 20
 years


93%
 of
 the
 participants
 failed
 to
 beat


the


index
 you
 would
 be
 concerned
 did
 these


people
 get


stupider
 I
 don't
 think
 so


well
 has
 the
 structure
 of
 the
 market


changed
 I
 think
 the
 structure
 of
 the


market
 has
 changed
 I
 think
 the
 whole


notion
 of
 daily
 liquidity
 is
 going
 to


change
 we
 are
 betting
 it
 on
 that
 we've


built
 a
 business
 that
 is
 650
 billion


today
 which
 will
 be
 twice
 its
 size
 in


five
 years
 based
 on
 a


bet
 that
 investors
 are
 going
 to
 revisit


how
 they
 think
 it
 is
 already
 happening


so
 if
 you
 take
 the
 typical
 investor
 and


I'll
 take
 your
 portfolio
 but
 then
 I'll


I'll
 simplify
 it
 um
 typical


Institutional
 Investor
 that
 invests
 with


us
 is
 50ish
 perc
 invested
 in
 public


Equity
 daily
 liquid
 30%
 invested
 in


fixed
 income
 daily
 liquid
 and
 20
 20%
 in


everything


else


why
 no
 one
 knows
 that's
 what
 we've
 done


that's
 what's
 worked
 historically
 and


we're
 actually
 watching
 this
 change
 in


real
 time
 and
 the
 the
 place
 it's


changing
 first
 is
 in
 fixed
 income
 a


single
 a
 rated
 private


security
 is
 that
 an
 alternative
 or
 is


that
 fixed
 income
 I
 ask
 cios
 this


question
 all
 the
 time
 it
 can
 stump
 them


for
 an
 hour
 because
 we've
 all
 grown
 up


thinking
 this
 thing
 doesn't
 exist
 we
 are


watching
 institutional
 investors
 look
 at


their
 fixed
 income
 portfolio
 and
 they


are
 moving
 their
 fixed
 income


portfolio
 not
 into
 public
 and
 private


but
 into
 Alpha
 and
 beta


we
 are
 going
 to
 watch
 a
 turnover
 of
 the


fixed
 income
 portfolio
 of
 institutional


investors
 move
 into
 private
 markets
 and


the
 reason
 that's
 happening
 is
 there's


an
 Arbiter
 there's
 a
 rating
 agency


someone
 can
 say
 this
 was
 a-rated
 this


was
 a-rated
 you
 can
 pick
 up
 200
 basis


points
 of
 yield
 for
 moving
 therefore
 we


should
 move
 since
 we
 don't
 need
 the


liquidity
 what
 about
 if
 the
 same
 were


true
 in


equity
 what
 if
 people
 took
 their
 50%


Equity
 bucket


and
 they
 actually
 thought
 about


diversification
 they
 thought
 about
 the


number
 of
 public
 companies
 and
 rather


than
 think
 about
 private
 Equity
 because


private
 equity
 and
 I
 know
 the
 debate
 is


taking
 place
 in
 this
 country
 in
 real


time
 private
 Equity
 is
 levered
 equity


it's
 in
 a
 fund
 structure
 it
 produces


some
 binary


outcomes
 what
 if
 we
 talked
 about
 Equity


that's
 private
 rather
 than
 private


Equity
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 harder
 move


for
 people
 because
 there's
 no
 rating


agent
 agency
 yet
 that
 is
 willing
 to


allow
 people
 to
 talk
 across
 the
 spectrum


of
 public
 and
 private
 and
 equal
 risk
 but


that's
 the
 world
 we
 live
 in
 today
 more


companies
 are
 going
 to
 be
 private
 people


who
 are
 not
 invested
 in
 in
 equity
 that


is
 private
 are
 missing
 out
 on
 half
 of


the
 marketplace
 they
 are
 concentrating


their
 portfolios
 the
 notion
 that
 their


public
 portfolios
 have
 performed
 well
 in


the


past
 does
 not
 surprise
 me
 we
 are
 indexed


and
 correlated
 we
 have
 been
 driven
 by


money
 flows
 we've
 printed
 $8
 trillion


doll
 in
 the
 US
 100%
 of
 last
 year's


return
 was
 essentially
 10


stocks
 everyone
 has
 woken
 up
 and


discovered
 that
 they
 own
 Nvidia
 apple


and
 Amazon
 and
 Microsoft
 and
 he's


levered
 the
 same
 way
 it's
 not
 clear
 to


me
 that
 that's


sustainable
 and
 for
 me
 as
 a
 leader
 of
 a


business
 I
 think
 Adam's
 notion
 of
 humble


confidence
 uh
 is
 is
 actually
 a
 really


good
 one
 we
 all


are
 confronted
 with
 change
 we're
 all


confronted
 with


uncertainty
 but
 while
 we
 do
 the
 little


things
 to
 deal
 with
 change
 and


uncertainty
 and
 we
 we
 reflect
 contrary


opinion
 and
 we
 allow
 for
 intellectual


insubordination
 how
 many
 of
 us
 actually


Force
 the
 organization
 to
 fundamentally


rethink
 whether
 the
 things
 we
 think
 are


true
 are


true
 I
 want
 to
 challenge
 that
 I
 want
 all


of
 you
 to
 think
 about
 that
 I
 don't
 think


what
 we've
 grown
 up
 in
 exists
 anymore
 I


don't
 think
 the
 financial
 system
 works


the
 way
 we
 think
 it
 does
 I
 think


liquidity
 is
 different
 the
 sources
 of


debt
 are
 different
 indexation
 and


correlation
 are
 different
 the
 whole


Notions
 of
 public
 and
 private
 are


different
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 the


strategies
 that
 we've
 employed
 over
 the


past
 40
 years
 are
 going
 to
 work
 going


forward
 that's
 a
 really
 uncomfortable


thing
 for
 us
 to
 deal
 with
 because
 we're


all
 used
 to
 doing
 due
 diligence
 and


looking
 at
 track
 record
 looking
 at


historical
 correlations


it's
 not
 clear
 to
 me
 that
 I
 is
 any
 value


thank
 you
 this
 has
 been
 great
