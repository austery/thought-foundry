- [Derek] This is a Strandbeest.
It's a walking skeleton
that's powered only by the wind,
created by Dutch inventor Theo Jansen.
There are no motors and no electronics,
and they're made of
the weirdest materials.
- Tape and glue and snot and screws,
and gets that force to transfer,
is really thrilling to me.
- I mean, now it's on "The Simpsons."
- The Strandbeest.
- Uh, is this science or garbage?
- Dutch art.
- [Derek] But how do they actually work,
and why did he build them?
Well, it all started 34 years ago.
- I promised myself to
spend one year on the tubes.
That was in 1990.
That got totally out of hand.
- A little.
(elegant classical music)
- [Derek] Now, Jansen's thinking bigger.
- I hope that that these
animals can survive
all the circumstances here on the beach,
like the storms and
the water and the sand.
Hopefully at the end of
my life, it's that far,
and that they can live on their own.
That's the idea.
A new specimen on Earth.
- [Derek] But to achieve this goal,
the beest had to overcome
six major challenges.
The first is that they had
to support their own weight.
- The beginning, I had lots of trouble
with the connections, the joints.
I used Sellotape to connect them.
And it all broke, you know.
- [Derek] As a result,
all the beest could do was lie on its back
and move its legs a little.
Yeah, I can imagine the
first thing I would do
is stop using tape.
(chuckling) Like, tape is
not a long-term solution.
- Right.
Yeah, no, it was very short term.
You can look at some of the pictures.
It's just like,
you see some tubes,
but you mostly see tape everywhere
trying to hold it together.
And so he too realizes this very quickly.
So the first fix to
this challenge is, like,
using zip ties.
Much more elegant, much more clean,
way, way stronger.
- [Derek] Jansen restricted himself
to only a few basic materials.
Still, five more hurdles remained,
the next of which was getting
the beest to walk smoothly.
To do this, Jansen realized that the path
traced out by their foot as it moves
is extremely important,
because if that's wonky
and all over the place,
the beest will likely lose its balance.
But if instead it traces
out a mostly flat surface
along the bottom,
well, then the beest
could keep its balance
and walk properly.
Now, you can get drastically
different footpaths
by changing the proportions of these tubes
and where they're placed.
Some footpaths might be wonky,
others a bit flat,
or just about anything in between.
But how do you find the right one?
That's what Jansen wanted to find out.
So in 1990, he wrote a computer program
that could compute the footpath
for any given combination of proportions.
Now, you might think,
"Just have the computer
go over trillions of possible options
and then pick the best one."
But that doesn't work.
- Then my computer would be on
for a hundred thousand years, yeah.
So that's why I use this evolution method
where you can come there a lot faster.
- [Derek] So, Jansen ran
a simulation that started
with 1,500 different
combinations of proportions,
resulting in 1,500 different footpaths.
Now, none of these curves
had a great flat surface at the bottom,
but some were slightly
more flat than others.
Those combinations would then reproduce
and multiply with slight changes
into 1,500 new combinations.
This evolutionary process went
on for months, day and night,
until, by the end of it,
these 13 holy numbers came out.
That's how he describes it.
They describe the proportions
and placements of all tubes
so that when you put them all together
and start rotating the
crankshaft right here,
they give you this footpath.
This is the path
that just about every
Strandbeest has traced out
for over 30 years.
If you then connect
different legs together
where each leg is out of phase
of the others by 120 degrees,
then you get this continuous smooth walk.
And those 13 holy numbers?
Well, I guess you could see that
as the genetic code of the Strandbeest.
- And the reason you
offset them by 120 degrees
is so that there's always feet
that are in contact with the ground,
which gives you this smooth ride.
- [Derek] And getting
this right is important.
In 2016, my friend and original
MythBuster, Adam Savage,
built his own pedal-powered Strandbeest.
- I found the movement of
his robots so compelling,
because it felt like looking
at a different kind of nature.
There's a tremendous amount
of force on the axle,
and that he builds all
this stuff with, like,
tape and glue and snot and screws
and gets that force to transfer
is really thrilling to me.
To be honest, I built
one at the Exploratorium
in their parking lot, over three days,
and for two days, I was getting it wrong.
- [Derek] Adam tried all kinds
of fixes to get it to walk,
but without success.
- But I remember building the Strandbeest
and hearing this guy
talking about something
I was getting wrong,
and I'm tuning him out, tuning
him out, tuning him out.
And then at four o'clock
between days two and three,
four o'clock in the morning,
I woke up and I was like,
(gasps) that guy's right.
(both laughing)
And he saw it on the
invitation to the build.
He saw that I had missed, in
my translation of a drawing,
I had missed one of the linkages,
and that I had this length
of the center triangle linkage off,
and I needed to push it out.
And it was like night and day.
I came in, fixed that thing,
cut all the way up the
middle of this metal bod,
extended everything by an inch,
and all of a sudden it just walked.
It was like, when you get it
right, that thing just moves.
- Ah, yes, yes! (whoops and laughs)
- Did you ever give that guy a heads up
and be like, "Hey, yeah."
- I did, but not till the end of the day.
- [Derek] Okay.
- I didn't wanna give him the satisfaction
while I was still working.
(both laughing)
That's my ego. (laughs)
- [Derek] But Adam's beest
lived in an exhibition.
(wind and sand whooshing)
Jansen's beests, on the other hand,
spend the entire summer on the beach,
where they're exposed to the elements.
So all the remaining hurdles
are about surviving and
conquering their natural habitat.
One major challenge is dealing with sand.
- [Casper] And the sand is very fluffy,
so it's very easy for them to get stuck,
especially if it's a stick.
It would just bury itself in,
and then it cannot move,
so it can survive.
- [Derek] To prevent this from happening,
the beests evolved feet
specifically adapted to the beach.
- What you can immediately see
is that it's not just a stick
that's poking into the ground.
Instead, you've got this
large sort of surface area.
Then it's much easier for it
to stay on top of the sand.
- [Derek] But they also fulfill
a less obvious function.
- You've got these wires here,
and what this does,
together away with the
larger surface area,
is it provides a lot more contact time
where the foot is basically
in touch with the ground.
So, when this foot is in
touch with the ground,
it can get taken over by another
and taken over by another.
And as a result you get
this very smooth ride,
which is what you're looking for,
to save the structure of the Strandbeest
and not put too much pressure on it.
- [Adam] Because I built
one with tennis shoes,
Theo explained to me
that having a couple of inches of play
in the linkage between the
final ankle and the tennis shoe
was mission critical
to allow that foot to stay in place
while the linkage got the other
foot up and ready to drop.
And that's apparently
how our walking works
is, you know, it's not a
straight, like, 1, 2, 3,
like a robot.
There is the swing,
- [Derek] But the beests
aren't always walking.
I mean, sometimes they're
tied up in the same place
for days or weeks.
And then, sand poses another major threat.
- If you leave a structure
like this on the beach,
you come back after three weeks
and it's totally covered with sand.
To avoid that,
I thought maybe if they
just lift up a little bit,
the sand goes under
there, and that buries.
- [Derek] This is how
flying Strandbeests evolved.
But the beests also face more
violent threats, like storms.
So, how can they increase
their odds of survival
during these times?
Well, for regular animals,
it's typically easier to
survive harsh conditions
by banding together.
And the same holds true for Strandbeests.
- And the idea behind this animal
was that they would survive
the storm maybe better
holding each other,
because if you see an
individual, like over there,
if you put it on the beach,
it blows over very easy.
So as an individual,
they wouldn't survive.
But as a group holding each other,
they are stronger in strong winds.
- [Derek] This also allows
for a different type of Strandbeest
- One that can be pulled.
And the big ideas actually
that this would be pulled
by the other Strandbeest.
Now, I asked Theo if I can
pull it, and he said yes.
So, we can grab it right here.
There's some hand markings,
and then now I should be the motor,
and his crawler should come behind me.
So let's see.
Oh man, this is cool.
This is very cool.
Walking a Strandbeest up a Dutch Beach.
What an epic job.
- Strandbeests are in
a never-ending battle
against the elements.
But they can help each
other by working together.
Not too long ago, I was in
an endless battle myself,
with spam callers.
And fortunately for me,
today's sponsor, Incogni,
is helping me in this fight.
See, there are data brokers out there
that collect all kinds of data on you,
like your name, phone
number, email address,
and even your social security number.
And then they sell all of this information
on the open market,
and that's why you can
get spam calls and emails
from people that you've never even
given your information to.
Well, Incogni fights the data brokers.
You just give them permission,
and then they'll figure
out who has your data,
which laws apply,
and then send each broker a letter
with all the correct legal terms
requesting that your
information be removed.
To see just how bad the problem is,
here's the work Incogni
has done for me so far.
Back in September, they
had filed 192 requests.
Now, they've filed 260,
which in total has saved
me over 160 hours of work.
So, to try Incogni and
fight the data brokers,

I wanna thank Incogni for
sponsoring this part of the video,
and now back to Strandbeests.
But if too much wind is a
problem, too little is as well.
- So right now you can actually see
one of the current fatal
flaws of the Strandbeest.
They walk when there's wind,
but as soon as the wind dies down,
the animal basically dies down as well.
And so this is one of the challenges
that Theo is actually
trying to solve right now.
Ah, there it goes again.
- [Derek] This is similar
to a challenge that life too has faced.
See, you can't always rely
on the currents of the wind or water
to take you where you need to go.
So what you want
is to stock up on energy
when it's plentiful,
and then use it later when you need it.
So you need two things,
a way to store energy,
and muscles that can
use this stored energy.
Now, to collect energy,
you've got this sail which
is moved by the wind,
and as it moves, it turns this crankshaft,
which then pushes this piston here,
and it can store pressurized
air in this plastic bottle.
- Just like a bicycle pump.
- [Casper] Do you know
sort of what pressures
it can go up to?
- It went up to five yesterday.
So, quite a pressure.
- Wow.
- They explode when
there are 10 bars, yeah.
Well, once I had a bottle,
and there was a a piston in there,
and it flew just next to my ear
through the window on the
back, so it broke the window.
So that was quite a happening.
- Wow.
Holy.
That's lucky.
(chuckling) That's a close call.
- [Derek] So, now that you
have a way to store energy,
you just need a way to use it.
(material rustling)
- And if you connect the
pressure with a pump like this,
this jumps out.
So you have a sort of muscle.
Muscle is nothing but an object
which becomes longer
or shorter on command.
So, we have pulling muscles,
and the Strandbeest, we
have pushing muscles.
- [Derek] This has
allowed some Strandbeests
to crawl slightly,
others to walk by
pushing themselves along,
and one to wag its tails.
One thing you might notice
is that with each challenge,
the Strandbeests become more
and more like real animals.
It's as if their process is mimicking life
and following a similar
evolutionary pattern.
And in a way, this is true,
because they have to overcome
many of the same challenges
that animals have had to.
And as life evolved,
it became more and more
aware of its surroundings.
And in at least one case,
it became conscious and self-aware.
But right now, there is
still one big challenge
the beests have to overcome.
- 'Cause they're blind and deaf,
they don't hear very serious,
so imagine that you're blind and deaf,
you can only feel around somehow.
- So, one of the challenges
that the Strandbeests run into
is that they're walking along the water,
and if they accidentally
go in the wrong direction
because they're being carried by the wind,
then they could end up in the water,
and that would be disastrous.
So to fix that, Theo has
been working on a system
that can actually sense
when it's touching the water
and then hopefully,
with a connection of
brain cells and muscles,
it can then course correct
to go away from the water
back onto the beach.
- And of course it's important to know
that you're close to the sea, right?
That's why I have a a water feeler here.
Oh, great, can you hold it here?
It goes over the ground about this height,
and it sucks in air all the time.
And as soon as it comes into the sea,
it swallows the water
and feels the resistance of the water.
(machine clicking)
It still doesn't work.
Well, I must regret-
(machine rattling)
Oh, now it's working.
I'm so happy.
(crew laughing)
- [Derek] But those senses are only useful
if you can process those inputs,
make a decision on what to do,
and then issue that to your muscles.
Like, when you walk into the water,
you should be able to use your
muscles to correct course.
So what you need is a nervous system,
a sort of brain, if you will.
- This is a nerve cell.
If I take the top off
and if I blow air in here,
the air goes in here and comes outta here.
So this is a connection.
But if I push in this
piston here, it's blocked.
So in fact, which you see
here is only a crank here,
only a valve.
Open, close, right?
Now I go to operate the
crank here, this air.
So if I blow air in here,
this closes, and no air comes outta here.
If you see this as the output
and this, the input,
the output is opposite from the input.
(upbeat music)
(graphics beeping)
In other words, you can
switch zeros and ones
just like in a computer.
So what you see here
is the beginning of the
brain of the Strandbeest.
- Do you have an idea how
many brain cells you'd need
to be able to make that work
so the animal walks into the water
and is able to turn around?
- 20, something like that.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
It's not very complicated.
- Yeah.
- The only thing is, here on the beach,
everything is complicated,
because sand creeps into everything
and so, yeah, it's not an easy thing, no.
(gentle music)
- [Derek] Over time, the
beests also slowly degrade.
They lose their color,
and parts might break off.
On the scale of the global
microplastic pollution problem,
this effect is small, but
it's certainly not helping.
Fortunately though, almost
all parts of the Strandbeests
are reused, sold as fossils,
or they end up in the graveyard.
It's crazy to think that all
of this has been made possible
by the obsession of one guy
tinkering away year after year.
But why did he do it?
During the late 1980s,
it was becoming clear that
rising levels of carbon dioxide
would warm the planet,
and therefore sea levels would rise
by as much as 2.2 meters by 2100.
And about a third of Jansen's
home country, the Netherlands,
lies below the current sea level,
so rising sea levels pose
a clear and present threat.
So Jansen came up with a solution.
He imagined this sort of
walking skeleton on the beach.
It would be powered by the wind,
and it would kick up sand as it walked.
Then this sand would blow to the dunes,
heightening them and hence
protecting the Netherlands
from the rising sea levels.
He published this idea in de Volkskrant
and called these skeletons Strandbeests.
I don't speak Dutch.
Strandbeest.
Is it the beach beast?
Like, what is that?
- Yeah, perfect.
It's the beach beast.
- (laughs) This is such a wacky idea.
- I know.
- Who comes up with that?
- Theo Jansen.
- [Derek] What started as
an article in a newspaper
turned into much more,
to the point where it's
basically defined Jansen's life.
So you might ask,
is it still really about
protecting the Netherlands?
And the answer is no, not really.
It's about a much more human need
that most of us have,
the desire to be remembered
after we're gone.
I mean, it's ominous to
imagine that we'll die
and be forgotten someday,
so a lot of us go to great
lengths to avoid this
by having kids donating
large sums of money
to get a building named after you,
or writing a book, these sorts of ideas.
For Jansen, it's making Strandbeests.
And when they fulfill their final goal
of living independently on the beach,
then, he wrote, "I can
die with peace of mind."
- The only thing is, I don't
have millions of years.
There's the problem a bit.
But maybe I can hypnotize
some young people around here.
There were some people who
were really very, very nice,
and they help me a lot,
so I might be able
to infect them with this Strandbeest virus
- Because people all over the world
are actually using this as well,
so, like, the virus is
spreading, in a way,
or whatever you want to call it.
- [Derek] Thousands of
people all over the world
are incorporating his 13 holy numbers
into their own designs.
From miniature Strandbeests,
to ones you can ride,
to a walking bicycle.
The genetic code of the beests
is spreading all over the world.
- He wants everyone to build one of these,
but I don't think he's
got any ulterior motive
except that he likes
seeing those things go.
And when he makes them go,
he has a set of rules and restrictions,
but he doesn't place those same
restrictions on anyone else.
I think that's really beautiful.
- And who knows,
perhaps one day they'll
achieve that ultimate goal.
A new species on earth,
roaming the world's beaches,
kicking up sand all along,
and maybe even protecting some coastlines
from rising sea levels.
