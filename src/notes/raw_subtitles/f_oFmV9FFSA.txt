Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to
 another


episode
 of
 the
 market
 futures.
 We
 are


live
 folks.
 It
 is
 Sunday.
 We've
 got
 14


minutes
 until
 once
 again
 the
 stock


market
 opens
 up.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for


being
 here.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 discuss.
 We


got
 a
 lot
 to
 get
 into.
 Hope
 everyone
 had


a
 good
 weekend.
 It's
 time
 to
 open
 up
 the


markets.
 Dude,
 it's
 been
 a
 long
 48


hours.
 I
 have
 got
 the
 jitters.
 I
 am


ready
 to
 get
 back
 into
 these
 markets.
 It


was
 a
 long
 week
 last
 week
 in
 terms
 of


all
 the
 emotionals
 up
 and
 down.
 little


not
 only
 the
 the
 emotional
 up
 and
 downs,


but
 the
 uh
 actual
 financial
 up
 and


downs.
 But
 I'm
 excited.
 I'm
 excited
 to


get
 back
 into
 it.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


fun
 week.
 Uh
 hopefully
 it's
 going
 to
 be


well
 it'll
 be
 fun.
 I
 don't
 know if
 it'll


be
 uh
 you
 know
 tears
 of
 joy
 or
 tears
 of


happiness,
 but
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 some


tears
 that
 eventually
 we'll
 we'll
 laugh


about
 in
 some
 way.
 Uh
 we've
 got
 Tesla


and
 Netflix
 earnings.
 So,
 we'll
 talk


about
 that.
 That's
 going to
 be
 big
 this


week.
 It
 officially
 starts
 off
 big
 tech.


last
 week
 had
 a
 great
 earnings
 for
 for


uh
 well
 not
 for
 tech
 but
 for
 TSM
 which


was
 one
 of
 the
 tech
 companies
 that


reported
 ASML
 and
 uh
 all
 the
 banks
 and


consumer
 discretionary
 companies
 pretty


much
 good
 across
 the
 board
 except
 a


couple
 of
 the
 regionals
 we'll
 talk
 more


about
 that
 but
 the
 other
 regionals
 on


Friday
 were
 pretty
 good
 so
 we're
 going


to
 continue
 tech
 earnings
 into
 this
 week


with
 Tesla
 and
 Netflix
 we
 got
 CPI
 on


Friday
 again
 the
 government
 is
 still


shut
 down
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 CPI


process
 is
 going
 to
 look
 like
 but
 we're


not
 going
 to
 get
 any
 other
 macro
 data


outside
 of
 CPI
 so
 that'll
 be
 important


on
 Friday
 uh
 and
 then
 Trump
 and
 Xi
 are


going
 to
 be
 meeting
 towards
 the
 end
 of


October,
 early
 November
 in
 South
 Korea.


So,
 uh
 I
 think
 this
 week
 you're
 probably


going
 to
 get
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 an
 update
 in


terms
 of
 what
 those
 negotiations
 are


going to
 look
 like.
 China
 over
 the


weekend
 pretty
 friendly.
 I
 mean,
 they


said
 some
 stuff
 that
 you
 wouldn't
 think


would
 would
 uh
 entail,
 but
 they
 want
 to


be
 super
 hostile
 and
 Trump
 kind
 of


reciprocated
 with
 some
 of
 his
 comments


that
 he
 made
 on
 Friday
 as
 well.
 So,
 I


think
 we'll
 get
 more
 negotiations
 or


more
 understanding
 of
 what
 the


negotiations
 look
 like.
 we
 will
 get
 some


of
 these
 earnings
 and
 uh
 we'll
 get
 some


macro
 data
 with
 CPI
 and
 hopefully
 a


little
 bit
 of
 negotiation
 for
 the


shutdown.
 We'll
 see
 how
 that
 plays
 out,


but
 hopefully
 it's
 not
 too
 bad.
 If
 the


audio
 is
 delayed,
 refresh
 YouTube,
 it


usually
 fixes
 itself.
 It's
 either
 a


Streamyard
 thing
 or
 a
 YouTube
 thing.


It's
 it's
 happened
 to
 me.
 It's
 happened


to
 a
 couple
 other
 people.
 Um
 if
 you


refresh
 it,
 I
 think
 it
 will
 fix.
 Or
 if


you
 just
 give
 it
 a
 couple
 of
 Yeah,


refresh.
 Yeah.
 Yeah,
 refresh
 should
 fix.


or
 give
 it
 a
 give
 it
 a
 couple
 minutes.


It
 should
 be
 should
 be
 okay.


All right.
 How
 is
 everyone's
 weekend?
 I


went
 home.
 Uh
 we
 have
 a
 uh
 Indian


holiday
 tomorrow.
 So,
 I'm
 going to
 go


back
 home
 again
 tomorrow
 for
 Diwali
 for


those
 that
 celebrate.
 Happy
 Dvali.


That'll
 be
 tomorrow.
 So,
 went
 home
 for
 a


bit.
 Kind
 of
 just
 got
 to
 chill
 with
 the


fam.
 And
 now
 I
 am
 back.
 Steve
 and
 I
 are


getting
 what
 are
 we
 getting?
 Uh
 steaks


tomorrow
 for
 lunch.
 So,
 that'll
 be
 super


fun
 and
 that'll
 be
 exciting.
 But
 overall


this
 week
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 to


talk
 about,
 a
 lot
 to
 get
 into
 and
 we'll


keep
 going
 from
 there.
 Two
 announcements


logistically
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep


actually
 three
 and
 then
 uh
 then
 we'll


get
 started
 with
 everything
 that
 we
 got


going
 on.
 I
 don't know
 if
 we're
 going
 to


shoot
 some
 fireworks
 to
 be
 honest.
 There


were
 I
 had
 a
 bunch
 of
 neighbors


yesterday
 though
 that
 like
 dude
 at
 like


1:00
 a.m.
 they
 were
 shooting
 up


fireworks
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 this


this
 is
 a
 bit
 aggressive
 at
 1:00
 a.m.


It's
 getting
 kind
 of
 loud
 here."
 But


we're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 uh
 if
 that
 still


happens.
 Um
 okay,
 three
 things.
 number


one,
 and
 they
 might
 not
 be
 in
 the
 chat


right
 now,
 but
 they
 probably
 will
 be
 in


the
 chat.
 Market
 open,
 market
 close.
 Uh,


folks,
 we
 have
 officially
 extended
 the


AK
 media
 team
 and
 brought
 someone
 on


fulltime.
 Cactus
 Jack.


Those
 of
 you
 who
 are
 in
 the
 chat
 every


day
 probably
 recognize
 Cactus
 Jack.
 If


you're
 listening
 every
 day,
 you
 you


probably
 don't
 um
 know
 who
 he
 is
 because


you
 don't
 keep
 up
 with
 chat.
 He
 is
 now


full-time
 with
 AK
 Media.
 So,
 Cactus
 Jack


is
 essentially
 our
 personal
 Bloomberg


terminal.
 And
 when
 I
 say
 hour,
 I
 mean


the
 entire
 chat
 because
 the
 level
 of


speed
 that
 he
 has
 dedicated
 to
 getting


us
 updates
 and
 news
 about
 what's
 going


on
 in
 the
 stock
 market,
 every
 single


market,
 open,
 market,
 close
 has
 been


remarkable.
 And
 uh
 you
 know,
 a
 week
 ago,


I
 mean,
 I've
 seen
 him
 for
 like
 two
 years


in
 the
 chat.
 A
 week
 ago,
 I'm
 just
 like,


"Bro,
 like
 why
 are
 you
 doing
 this
 every


day?"
 And
 he
 was
 just
 like,
 "Wow,
 I
 just


love
 being
 here.
 I
 love
 the
 community


you
 built."
 And
 I'm
 like,
 "Okay,
 well,
 I


feel
 bad
 that
 you're
 doing
 this
 every


single
 day
 for
 free.
 Uh,
 and
 I
 also


think
 we
 might
 as
 well
 formalize
 this


relationship
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 here


anyway."
 There
 he
 is.
 There's
 Mr.
 Cactus


Jack.
 And,
 uh,
 he
 said,
 "Let's
 do
 it."


So,
 Cactus
 is
 officially
 part
 of
 the


team.
 If
 you
 ever
 see
 a
 post
 from


Cactus,
 uh,
 it
 is
 most
 more
 likely
 than


not
 accurate,
 whether
 it's
 earnings,


Trump
 tweets,
 headlines,
 whatever
 it
 is.


So,
 if
 you
 see
 him
 in
 the
 chat,
 think
 of


him
 as
 our
 our
 personal
 Bloomberg


terminal.
 At
 this
 point,
 his
 full-time


job
 now
 is
 to
 just
 research,
 get
 updates


on
 the
 market.
 And
 it
 it
 really
 is
 going


to
 help
 me
 do
 my
 job
 better,
 which
 is


communicating
 all
 the
 information
 and


finding
 all
 the
 updates
 in
 real
 time.


And
 uh
 having
 a
 trusted
 source
 that
 I


can
 rely
 on
 and
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 can


convey
 everything
 that's
 happening
 in


real
 time,
 which,
 you
 know,
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people,
 you
 make
 decisions
 based
 on
 the


headlines
 that
 come
 up
 when
 you're


trading.
 That's
 really
 important.
 And


so,
 Cactus
 uh
 will
 be
 full-time
 with
 us.


So,
 very
 excited
 for
 him
 and
 uh
 excited


to
 expand
 the
 team
 a
 bit
 further.
 And
 I


think
 it'll
 make
 the
 show
 better
 because


quite
 frankly,
 I
 mean,
 I
 you
 guys
 can


probably
 already
 tell
 I've
 started
 to


get
 a
 bit
 overwhelmed
 with
 just
 like


everything
 that's
 needed
 to
 to
 make
 the


show
 happen
 every
 day.
 It's
 a
 lot
 of


research,
 a
 lot
 of
 just
 pre-planning,


post-planning.
 It's
 booking
 guests.


Like,
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 [ __ ]
 you
 know?
 So,


at
 this
 point,
 I
 think
 starting
 the


expansion
 makes
 sense.
 And
 uh
 yeah,


that's
 why
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 it.
 So,


shout
 out
 to
 Cactus.
 He'll
 be
 here
 every


day.
 And
 he
 is
 officially
 starting
 out


on
 the
 team.
 Second
 update.
 So,
 I
 told


you
 guys
 post
 Miami
 that
 I
 really
 want


to
 take
 the
 meetups
 more
 seriously
 in


2026
 in
 terms
 of
 planning,
 logistics,


infrastructure,
 security,
 all
 this


stuff.
 Like
 basically,
 it
 was
 a
 fun
 idea


in
 my
 head
 to
 do
 these
 meetups.
 The
 fun


idea
 manifested
 into
 like
 a
 real


community
 building
 event
 from
 50
 people


in
 New
 York
 to
 350
 people
 in
 Miami.
 And


it
 kind
 of
 dawned
 on
 me
 that
 if
 we're


going
 to
 do
 this,
 we
 should
 do
 this.
 You


know,
 it
 shouldn't
 just
 be
 me
 managing


through
 a
 Google
 form
 how
 to
 get
 all


this
 stuff
 done.
 to
 like
 actually
 have


real
 infrastructure
 so
 that
 we
 can
 put


on
 a
 good
 event
 for
 as
 many
 events
 as
 we


can
 do
 and
 it
 actually
 allows
 us
 to
 like


go
 to
 different
 parts
 of
 the
 world,


travel,
 book
 these
 venues
 and
 make
 it


happen.
 I
 had
 a
 meeting
 yesterday
 with
 a


PRmanagement
 agency
 and
 uh
 it
 was
 a
 very


good
 meeting.
 Like
 it
 was
 a
 it
 was
 one


of
 those
 meetings
 where
 it's
 like
 it's


clicking
 on
 all
 cylinders
 and
 I
 really


like
 the
 people
 that
 I
 met
 yesterday.
 No


confirmed
 official
 deal.
 They're
 going


to
 be
 in
 Jersey
 in
 November
 and
 then
 I'm


gonna
 meet
 them
 in
 person.
 And
 um
 yeah,


he's
 my
 Jamie
 like
 Joe
 Rogan.
 Exactly.


Cactus
 Jack
 is
 our
 Jamie.
 100%
 he's
 our


Jamie.
 Um
 I
 I
 I
 think
 I
 I
 think
 we
 have,


you
 know,
 I'm
 really
 uh
 in,
 you
 know,
 I


I
 make
 decisions
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 based
 on


intuition.
 I
 don't
 need
 to
 shop
 around


too
 much.
 Cactus
 Jack
 was
 an
 intuitive


decision
 and
 my
 intuition
 ended
 up
 being


right
 because
 he
 immediately
 was
 like,


"Yes,
 let's
 do
 it."
 And
 based
 on
 the


meeting
 I
 had
 yesterday,
 uh
 very
 very


excited
 for
 it.
 And
 and
 the
 cool
 thing


about
 the
 meeting
 I
 had
 yesterday
 is


this
 is
 not
 some
 super
 super
 big
 like


management
 talent
 agency
 yada
 yada.
 This


is
 one
 person
 who
 spent
 10
 years
 working


at
 that
 agency
 and
 now
 she's
 starting


her
 own
 firm.
 And
 that's
 what
 really
 got


me
 excited
 because
 I
 would
 not
 just
 be


one
 client
 that's
 part
 of
 like
 the
 cog


in
 the
 machine
 of
 all
 these
 other
 people


that
 the
 agency
 manages.
 I
 would
 be
 like


one
 of
 honestly
 I
 don't even
 know
 if
 she


has
 any
 other
 clients.
 I
 mean,
 she


literally
 quit
 five
 weeks
 ago.
 So,
 like


I
 think
 I
 might
 be
 her
 first
 client,


which
 means
 she
 would
 be
 very
 motivated


to
 get
 the
 job
 done
 and
 really
 take
 this


to
 the
 next
 level.
 And
 uh
 I
 met
 her


through
 a
 contact
 that
 I
 met
 in
 Miami


and
 the
 guy
 I
 met
 in
 Miami
 has
 40
 years


of
 experience
 in
 event
 planning.
 So,
 and


so
 he's
 not
 some
 just
 random
 dude
 that


hit
 me
 up
 out
 of
 nowhere.
 Like
 this
 is
 a


guy
 who's
 been
 following
 the
 channel
 for


the
 past
 couple
 years.
 Really,
 really


cares
 about
 the
 authenticity
 and
 the


vibe
 of
 the
 community
 because
 you
 know


that's
 the
 biggest
 thing
 about
 these


meetups.
 They
 are
 not
 money
 makers.
 that


like
 this
 is
 not
 some
 grand
 vision
 to


profit.
 The
 vision
 is
 how
 do
 we
 create


an
 experience
 for
 people
 that
 don't
 have


a
 community
 uh
 in
 investing
 and
 do
 it


across
 the
 world
 and
 do
 it
 in
 a
 way
 that


can
 be
 successful
 and
 I
 think
 the
 first


five
 meetups
 we've
 done
 Toronto,
 Boston,


Miami,
 California
 and
 New
 York
 showed


that
 there
 is
 demand
 for
 this
 but
 now
 we


got
 to
 make
 it
 structured
 and
 so
 I
 am


very
 very
 excited
 for
 that.
 Again,
 we


don't
 have
 an
 official
 deal
 yet,
 but
 uh


I
 think
 if
 we
 can
 get
 that
 deal
 done
 by


the
 end
 of
 the
 year,
 then
 the
 planning


of
 venues
 across
 the
 world
 is
 going
 to


get
 a
 lot
 easier.
 And
 it'll
 be
 pretty


cool
 to
 make
 this
 happen.
 So,
 should
 be


fun.
 Should
 be
 very
 fun.
 The
 first


location
 I
 can
 I
 think
 I've
 already
 said


this
 before,
 but
 the
 first
 location,
 by


the
 way,
 Ethereum,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 get
 to


4,000
 right
 here.
 Uh
 likely
 will
 be
 New


York
 in
 January.
 Likely
 will
 be
 New


York.
 So,
 um
 hopefully
 if
 all
 goes
 as


planned,
 the
 New
 York
 happens
 in


January.
 And
 if
 it
 does,
 then
 I'd
 be


very
 excited
 to
 kick
 off
 New
 York
 again.


And
 then
 we'll
 see
 what
 we
 can
 do
 um
 in


the
 other
 locations.
 And
 then
 there
 was


a
 third
 update.
 What
 was
 the
 third


update?


What
 was
 the
 third
 update?
 I
 said
 it
 was


Cactus
 Jack.
 Uh
 the
 the
 talent
 planning


stuff.
 I
 forgot
 the
 third
 one.
 I
 feel


like
 there
 was
 an
 important
 third.
 Oh


yes,
 the
 third
 update.
 Dude,
 the


substack.
 You
 guys
 have
 been
 absolutely


like
 just
 it's
 it's
 been
 I
 think
 I'm


falling
 in
 love
 with
 writing,
 dude.
 Like


this
 thing
 is
 cool.
 I
 you
 know,
 usually


I
 take
 Saturdays
 off
 to
 like
 just
 like


not
 think
 about
 stocks
 and
 the
 market


and
 stuff.
 I
 already
 started
 working
 on


the
 next
 two
 deep
 dives.
 I
 have
 already


started
 working
 on
 the
 next
 two
 deep


dives.
 So
 the
 companies
 were
 BMR
 and


Duolingo.
 BMR
 and
 Duolingo.
 I
 know
 BMR
 a


lot
 of
 people
 expected.
 Duolingo
 caught


a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 off
 off
 guard.
 Matt


Money
 did
 guess
 it
 though
 on
 Friday.


Dude,
 I
 am
 I
 am
 just
 really
 I
 don't


know.
 I
 I've
 never
 been
 a
 writer,
 but


the
 the the
 process
 of
 really
 sitting


down
 with
 your
 thoughts
 and
 not
 speaking


them,
 but
 writing
 them
 out,
 it's


annoying.
 It's
 hard.
 I
 like
 don't
 love


it
 as
 much
 as
 I
 love
 talking.
 But
 it's
 a


new
 challenge
 and
 and
 quite
 frankly,
 I
 I


really
 am
 wanting
 to
 embrace
 this


challenge.
 So,
 deeply
 deeply
 appreciate


anyone
 who
 subscribed.
 If
 you
 didn't,


I'll
 put
 the
 link
 in
 the
 chat.
 There
 was


no
 payw
 wall.
 So
 for
 anyone
 who
 wants
 to


read
 the
 deep
 dives,
 you
 can


uh
 read
 it
 whenever
 you
 want
 and


whatever
 future
 content
 comes
 out
 on
 the


substack,
 feel
 free
 to
 read
 it.
 I
 mean,


I'm
 thinking
 of
 so
 many
 other
 ideas,


too,
 like
 Palanteer's
 Q3
 earnings.
 Like


usually
 I
 make
 a
 video
 on
 that.
 I'll


continue
 to
 make
 a
 video
 on
 that.
 But
 I


also
 would
 want
 to
 write
 out
 my
 thoughts


on
 Palunteers's
 earnings.
 Robin
 Hood
 has


earnings
 up
 coming.
 I
 want
 to
 write
 out


my
 thoughts
 on
 Robin
 Hood.
 like
 just
 the


process
 of
 writing.
 Like
 literally
 this


weekend,
 bro,
 on
 Saturday,
 I'm
 over
 here


getting
 ready
 on
 the
 next
 two
 deep
 dives


and
 I'm
 starting
 to
 research
 and
 type


and
 I'm
 like,
 damn,
 bro.
 I
 didn't
 know
 I


would
 like
 it
 this
 much,
 but
 there's


something
 about
 it
 that
 I
 really
 do


freaking
 enjoy.
 And
 uh
 it's
 kind
 of
 like


a
 new
 life
 for
 me
 in
 terms
 of
 content


creation.
 I
 never
 thought
 the
 written


word
 would
 be
 a
 way
 that
 I
 engage
 in


content.
 And
 after
 I
 wrote
 that
 grab


thesis
 back
 in
 um
 back
 in
 June,
 those
 17


pages,
 like
 I
 kind
 of
 started
 liking
 the


idea
 of
 it,
 but
 then
 I
 kind
 of
 got
 away


from
 it.
 And
 then,
 you
 know,
 over
 the


past
 couple
 of
 weeks,
 I
 was
 just
 like,


well,
 why
 don't
 I
 try
 that
 again
 and
 see


what
 it
 feels
 like?
 And
 it
 it
 really
 it


really
 did
 feel
 awesome.
 So,
 deeply


deeply
 appreciate
 anyone
 who
 subscribed.


It
 will
 be
 free
 forever.
 Looking
 forward


to
 a
 lot
 more
 written
 word.
 Got
 a
 lot
 of


good
 feedback
 on
 it.
 Uh
 Mr.
 Tom
 Lee
 was


nice
 enough
 to
 uh
 retweet
 it
 as
 well
 and


share
 it
 to
 his
 audience.
 So,
 he
 said,


"Primary
 fundamental
 analysis
 done
 by
 a


few
 individuals
 today.
 Appreciate
 the


work."


And
 yeah,
 it
 was
 it
 was
 super
 cool.
 And


the
 BMR
 one
 was,
 you
 know,
 I
 spent
 a
 lot


of
 time
 trying
 to
 understand
 it.
 And
 you


know,
 we
 as
 a
 community
 have
 spent
 a
 lot


of
 time
 trying
 to
 understand,
 you
 know,


we
 gonna
 we're
 going
 to
 make
 some
 money


off
 BMR.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 I
 still
 have


my
 position.
 I
 added
 a
 little
 bit
 at


4950
 on
 Friday,
 and
 I
 continue
 to


believe
 that
 it
 will
 play
 out.
 But
 just


writing
 everything
 out
 in
 your,
 you


know,
 you
 you
 never
 know
 if
 you're
 going


to
 be
 right
 or
 wrong,
 but
 just
 being


able
 to
 document
 all
 of
 it
 through
 the


written
 word,
 I
 think,
 is
 really


special.
 So,
 exciting
 stuff.
 And
 yes,
 I


will
 post
 the
 graph
 thesis
 on
 Substack


that'll
 probably
 come
 out
 next
 Friday.
 I


don't
 have
 to,
 you
 know,
 redo
 that
 one.


I'm
 going
 to
 update
 it
 because
 I
 already


wrote
 it
 out.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 just
 like


copy
 and
 paste
 it
 into
 the
 Substack


format.
 But,
 there
 are
 some
 things
 I
 do


want
 to
 update,
 especially
 because
 we


got
 Q2
 results.
 Uh,
 and
 you
 know,
 we
 got


a
 bunch
 of
 new
 products
 that
 have
 been


released
 in
 the
 past
 couple
 months.
 So,


I
 will
 update
 that
 graph
 thesis.
 By
 the


way,
 the
 uh
 COO
 of
 Grab
 did
 a
 new


interview.
 This
 is
 like
 seven
 to
 eight


interviews
 in
 the
 past
 month
 from
 Grab


executives.
 They
 have
 not
 done
 this
 for


the
 past
 five
 years.
 So,
 I'm
 thinking


it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 good
 Q3.
 We'll
 see


how
 it
 plays
 out.
 But,
 um,
 yes,
 I
 will


update
 that
 as
 well.
 And
 we'll
 keep


going
 from
 there.
 Oh,
 we
 got
 to
 talk


about
 Amcore.
 We
 will
 have
 to
 talk
 about


AMCore.
 We
 got
 some
 updates
 on
 Amcore


over
 the
 weekend
 and
 we
 got
 we
 that
 that


will
 intertwine
 with
 Nvidia.
 So,
 we'll


talk
 about
 that
 after
 we
 uh
 after
 we
 see


how
 these
 stocks
 open
 on
 the
 overnight


markets.
 All right,
 so
 we
 got
 two


minutes
 and
 then
 we
 got
 a
 bunch
 of


headlines.
 We'll
 get
 into
 those


headlines.
 Futures
 are
 green
 for
 those


that
 didn't
 see
 it.
 Uh
 very
 excited
 to


see
 how
 this
 market
 opens.
 I
 mean,
 look,


it's
 it
 could
 it
 could
 be
 a
 low


liquidity
 Friday
 or
 not
 Friday,
 Sunday


overnight
 markets
 and
 this
 fades
 by


Monday
 morning.
 But
 you
 do
 have
 Bitcoin


and
 Ethereum
 that
 are
 finally
 not
 being


as
 weak
 as
 they
 were.
 Uh,
 you
 know,


Bitcoin
 got
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to
 freaking


102.
 Now
 it's
 at
 108.
 Ethereum
 got
 to


3,400.
 Ethereum
 back
 to
 3,800.
 So,
 not


really
 fully
 breaking
 out,
 but
 nice
 to


see
 them
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 base.


I
 have
 decided
 I
 will
 be
 buying
 SoFi.
 I


might
 even
 do
 it
 tonight.
 I'm
 taking
 a


SoFi
 500
 shares
 earnings
 gamble.
 I'm


doing
 it
 because
 if
 it
 goes
 up,
 I
 want


to
 be
 celebrating
 with
 everybody
 else.


If
 it
 doesn't,
 I'll
 be
 back
 holding
 with


everybody
 else.
 So,
 I
 kind
 of
 want
 to


get
 it
 at
 like
 2650
 and
 below.
 I
 feel


like
 I
 don't know,
 maybe
 we'll
 get
 it


this
 week,
 maybe
 not.
 If
 we
 see
 it
 below


2650,
 maybe
 we'll
 buy
 it
 tonight.
 But,


I'm
 going
 to
 go
 for
 500
 shares
 and
 we'll


see
 what
 happens.
 I
 mean,
 Tanner
 is


freaking
 screaming
 about
 a
 million


members
 and
 [ __ ]
 I'm
 like,
 "All
 right,


Tanner,
 if
 it's
 that
 serious,
 let's
 see.


Maybe
 maybe
 not
 can
 deliver
 some
 goods."


So,
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 All right,


overnight
 markets.
 They
 should
 be


opening
 in
 15
 seconds.
 Let's
 see
 some
 of


this
 price
 action.
 see
 what
 we
 got.
 Then


we'll
 get
 into
 the
 headlines.
 Again,


thank
 you everybody
 for
 being
 here.


Three
 headlines
 for
 AK
 Media.
 We
 hired


Cactus
 Jack
 full-time.
 He's
 going
 to
 be


our
 Bloomberg
 terminal.
 Uh
 meetups,
 I


think,
 are
 in
 the
 right
 direction
 in


terms
 of
 the
 planning
 going
 into
 next


year.
 I
 really
 do
 think
 we're
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 do
 it
 in
 a
 in
 a
 more


sophisticated
 way
 and
 and
 hopefully


visit
 a
 lot
 more
 cities.
 And
 then


finally,
 the
 Substack.
 Deeply
 deeply


appreciate
 everyone
 who
 has
 subscribed


to
 that
 Substack.
 All right,
 let's
 get


into
 it.
 Overnight
 markets
 are
 open


hoodie
 132.
 There's
 a
 green
 candle.


That's
 up
 2%.
 Fell
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to


127.


No,
 it
 fell
 to
 122
 Friday
 at
 2
 am.


Palanteer
 right
 here
 at
 178.
 That's


green
 by
 about
 a
 third
 of
 a
 percent.


Tesla,
 we
 got
 some
 updates
 on
 Tesla.
 We


got
 to
 talk
 about
 that.
 440.80.
 Uh,
 we


do
 have
 earnings
 on
 Tesla,
 so
 that's


going
 to
 matter
 as
 well.
 Nvidia,
 that's


green,
 up
 about
 08%.
 S&P,
 that's
 green.


AMD,
 that's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 AMD
 was
 at


240
 241
 last
 week.
 Uh,
 closed
 at
 around


232.
 SoFi,
 2683.
 All
 right,
 we're
 up
 1%


of
 the
 day
 on
 SoFi.
 Grabby
 Grab
 571,


that's
 green.
 Google
 253,
 that's
 green.


Reddit,
 that's
 up.
 Amazon,
 that's
 up.


Meta,
 that's
 flat.
 Salesforce
 is
 up.
 You


pretty
 much
 got
 green
 across
 the
 board.


PayPal's
 green.
 Apple's
 green.
 SMCI
 is


green.
 BMR
 should
 be
 like
 52,
 right?
 BMR


5204.
 5204
 for
 BMR.
 So,
 we
 are
 green
 on


that
 as
 well.
 Uh,
 I
 don't
 know if
 Amcore


trades
 overnight.
 Oh,
 no.
 Well,
 it
 got


to
 move
 3230.
 It's
 probably
 very
 low


volume
 but
 up
 from
 31
 to
 3238.
 Jensen


literally
 mentioned
 AMC
 in
 an
 interview


that
 he
 did
 today.
 So
 we'll
 we'll
 play


the
 interview
 and
 we'll
 talk
 about
 it.


But
 uh
 I
 I
 I
 you
 know
 even
 at
 this
 price


trading
 at
 1.15
 time
 sales
 I
 I
 think


there
 is
 some
 upside
 there
 if
 they
 can


keep
 executing.
 Hims
 now
 got
 wrecked
 on


Friday
 down
 15%.


It's
 recovering
 a
 little
 bit
 up
 2.43%.


Uh
 but
 this
 one
 did
 really
 take
 a
 hit.
 I


think
 it
 was
 after
 the
 Trump
 comments


around
 Ompic,
 but
 you
 know,
 there
 might


have
 been
 some
 other
 issues
 with


lawsuits
 that
 kind
 of
 just
 flood
 into


the
 narrative.
 Eli
 Lily,
 that's
 flat
 on


the
 day.
 Archer,
 Verizon,
 Archer's
 up


2%,
 Verizon's
 flag.
 GameStop's
 up
 a


little
 bit.
 Oh,
 the
 Game
 Store
 um
 or


GameStore,
 GameStop
 CEO,
 what's
 his


name?
 Ryan
 Cohen,
 he'll
 be
 live
 tomorrow


on
 uh
 TBPN,
 which
 is
 like
 this
 tech
 bros


podcast
 thing.
 And
 uh
 he'll
 be
 live
 at


12
 p.m.
 Eastern.
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 curious


to
 see
 kind
 of
 how
 he
 talks
 about


GameStop.
 He
 hasn't
 done
 interviews
 in
 a


long
 time.
 So,
 we'll
 see
 what
 Mr.
 Ryan


Cohen
 has
 to
 say.
 Iran,
 Bitcoin
 miners,


those
 got
 wrecked
 last
 week
 as
 well.


Granted,
 they've
 had
 a
 phenomenal


phenomenal
 year
 to
 date.
 Cipher,
 Clean,


Spark,
 Wolf,
 all
 of
 them
 are
 pretty
 much


green.
 Bit
 farm's
 up
 10%.
 Look
 at that.


Bitform's
 550
 from
 5
 to
 550.
 Not
 too


bad.
 Marathon's
 up
 two.
 Riots's
 up
 one.


Galaxy's
 up
 4.3%.
 Rare
 Earth
 stocks
 are


green
 overnight.
 MP
 that's
 up.
 TMQ


that's
 up.
 CRML
 that's
 up.
 LAC
 that
 is


also
 up.
 Where
 is
 Rocket
 Lab?
 Are
 we
 at


70?
 Rocket
 Lab
 is
 at
 67.
 ASTS
 I
 think


closed
 at
 83.
 We
 are
 now
 at
 85.
 That's


up
 2.34%
 on
 the
 day.
 Um,


that
 stock
 right
 there
 up
 7%
 as
 well.


Again,
 the
 financials
 last
 week
 crushed


it
 outside
 of
 the
 regional
 banks,
 but


the
 regionals
 that
 reported
 on
 Friday


did
 not
 show
 that
 there
 was
 some


systemic
 structural
 problem
 with
 credit


even
 though
 that
 became
 the
 narrative.


And
 that's
 kind
 of why
 I
 think
 the
 S&P


recovered
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 on


Friday.
 But
 KRE
 regional
 banking
 ETF


that's
 also
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 as
 well.


Snapchat,
 what
 do
 we
 got
 there?
 That
 is


slightly
 green
 770
 up
 by
 about
 5%.
 Talk


to
 Invest
 Answers
 about
 Salana.
 We
 have


DM'd.
 He's
 going
 to
 be
 on
 the
 channel


eventually.
 We're
 just
 trying
 to
 find


out
 the
 schedules.
 Uh
 I'm
 a
 fan
 of
 his


channel.
 I
 mean
 he's
 he's
 been
 on
 the


Bitcoin
 Salana
 Tesla
 thesis
 for
 a
 very


long
 time.
 So
 we'll
 get
 him
 on


eventually
 and


hopefully
 we'll
 continue
 to
 get
 some


updates
 on
 that.
 Google
 253,
 S&P


slightly
 green.
 I
 mean,
 not
 crazy
 crazy


preaction.


Walmart's
 flat,
 Lyft
 is
 up
 a
 little
 bit,


the
 VIX
 is
 down,
 which
 is
 good
 to
 see.


Iran
 again
 up
 2%.
 Duolingo,
 so
 Duolingo


was
 one
 of the
 companies
 I
 did
 a
 deep


dive
 on.
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 a
 lot
 of
 respect


for
 Duolingo
 after
 that
 deep
 dive
 and


and
 the
 number
 one
 reason
 why
 is
 the


section
 where
 I
 talk
 about
 their
 data


advantage.
 Like
 as
 I
 was
 writing
 that


and
 researching
 it,
 it
 made
 me
 realize,


dude,
 big
 tech
 doesn't
 have
 the
 data


advantage
 that
 Dualingo
 has.
 And
 I
 know


that's
 crazy
 to
 say,
 but
 in
 this


specific
 niche
 about
 language
 learning,


I
 really
 do
 think
 there
 is
 a
 moat.
 Now,


I
 go
 on
 to
 say
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 article


why
 I
 I'm
 not
 establishing
 a
 position,


but
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 people
 are
 going
 to


be
 upset
 in
 five
 years
 buying
 dual
 like


I
 think
 it
 will
 outperform
 the
 market,


which
 is
 what
 you
 care
 about,
 right?
 I


just
 it's
 not
 enough.
 It's
 not
 I'm
 not


confident
 the
 value.
 If
 you
 go
 through


the
 valuation
 section,
 it's
 not
 like,
 oh


my
 goodness,
 this
 is
 the
 most
 compelling


opportunity
 ever.
 Like
 that's
 just
 not


it's
 just
 like
 the
 numbers
 show
 you
 that


even
 if
 you,
 you
 know,
 really
 get
 a
 bit


more
 aggressive
 on
 your
 multiples,
 maybe


you're
 getting
 a
 2x
 on
 this
 over
 the


next
 5
 to
 10
 years,
 which
 is
 great,
 but


it's
 not
 like
 in
 the
 age
 of
 AI,


something
 that's
 so
 compelling
 when


there's
 all
 these
 other
 infrastructure


plays
 that
 are
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 solid


than
 Duolingo
 and
 don't
 have
 to
 deal


with
 the
 competitive
 threats.
 But
 I
 have


a
 lot
 of
 respect,
 a
 lot
 of
 freaking


respect
 for
 what
 Lewis
 has
 built
 um
 from


a
 data
 perspective.
 And
 you
 know,
 it


seems
 like
 they're
 probably
 going
 to


continue
 to
 grow
 topline
 the
 way
 they've


been
 growing.
 Lift
 right
 there,
 that's


up
 about
 1.3%.
 How
 about
 Uber?
 How's


that
 doing?
 Uber
 is
 9249.
 Okay,
 that's


up
 2%
 as
 well.
 Navitas,
 I
 don't
 think


that
 trades
 overnight.
 Yeah,
 it
 doesn't


trade
 overnight.
 You
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of


a
 jump,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 is
 not
 a
 ton


of
 volume
 that's
 there.
 And
 then
 where's


SoFi?
 Are
 we
 27?
 So
 527
 of
 course
 of


course
 it
 jumps
 when
 I'm
 trying
 to
 buy


it.
 We'll
 see.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 get
 to


freaking
 2650.
 That's
 kind
 of
 my
 zone.


If
 we
 don't
 then
 we'll
 buy
 it.
 I
 I
 don't


want
 to
 pay
 more
 than
 you
 know
 2850
 for


this.
 Realistically
 I
 would
 like
 to
 get


in
 low
 26s
 but
 let's
 see
 this
 week
 if
 we


get
 an
 opportunity.
 Netflix
 is
 going to


be
 a
 big
 earnings
 this
 week
 even
 with


all
 the
 Elon
 backlash
 controversy
 they


had
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 So
 we'll


see
 if
 that
 can
 be
 recovered.
 1202
 Robin


Hoodie
 13250.
 They
 do.
 The
 NBA
 is
 coming


back
 in
 two
 weeks.
 I
 mean,
 prediction


markets
 have
 already
 been
 crushing
 it
 on


Robin
 Hood
 when
 the
 when
 the
 I
 actually


know
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the
 NBA.
 I
 kind


of
 don't
 know
 anything
 about
 football.


So,
 I'm
 probably
 going
 to
 take
 some


prediction
 market
 bets
 when
 basketball


comes
 back
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 just
 going


to
 keep
 ramping
 up
 the
 contracts
 for


them.
 Also,
 I
 got
 some
 of
 you
 guys
 that


DM'd
 me
 emails
 from
 Robin
 Hood.
 Uh,
 they


are
 officially
 inviting
 people
 to
 their


beta
 of
 banking.
 So,
 a
 couple
 of
 you


guys
 emailed
 me
 the
 screenshot
 of
 Robin


Hood
 inviting
 you
 to
 be
 inside
 of
 the


beta
 for
 banking.
 So,
 I
 think
 maybe


January,
 February
 is
 where
 they
 start
 to


ramp
 up
 banking
 and
 they're
 trying
 to


just
 make
 sure
 they
 have
 the
 logistics


of
 it
 planned
 out.
 That's
 probably
 also


why
 they've
 started
 giving
 out
 so
 many


of
 these
 credit
 cards
 as
 like
 a


precursor
 to
 get
 people
 into
 the
 banking


system.
 So,
 that
 could
 be
 a
 nice


tailwind
 going
 into
 Q4
 of
 this
 year
 and


then
 Q1
 of
 next
 year.
 Pounder
 right


there
 17892.
 We'll
 talk
 about
 pounder
 as


well.
 Sham
 Sanker
 CTO
 wrote
 a
 pretty


spicy
 article
 for
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal
 in
 an
 op-ed.
 So,
 we'll
 talk


about
 what
 he
 said.
 You
 got
 pounder


right
 there
 that's
 up
 half
 a
 percent.


Tesla's
 up
 half
 a
 percent.
 Then
 Nvidia


is
 up.33%


on
 the
 day.


All
 right,
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 Nothing


too
 crazy.
 Nothing
 too
 crazy.


Uh
 stocks
 are
 green,
 which
 is
 nice,
 but


we're
 going
 to
 really
 see
 tomorrow
 kind


of
 where
 it
 goes
 from
 there.
 Nebas
 as


well
 at
 100


14.
 Quantum's
 up
 again,
 dude.


They
 they
 they
 weren't
 even
 that
 weak


last
 week.
 I
 mean
 they
 they
 were
 like


kind
 of
 weak.
 Some
 of
 them
 really
 got


hit
 but
 the
 rest
 of
 them
 just
 like
 kept


chugging
 along.
 So
 they
 have
 taken
 on
 a


complete
 life
 a
 complete
 life
 of
 their


own.
 Coreweave
 that
 stock
 137.


Uh
 and
 then
 BMR
 are
 we
 up
 a
 little
 bit


more?
 BMR
 5170.
 Okay.
 So
 just
 below
 52.


ETH
 and
 Bitcoin.
 Yeah
 they're
 flat.


Bitcoin
 109.
 Bitcoin
 did
 break
 out
 to


110
 this
 morning.
 Now
 it's
 back
 at
 108.


And
 then
 Ethereum
 right
 there
 at
 39.68.


All right
 cool.
 Let's
 get
 into
 some


headlines.
 I
 think
 we'll
 start
 off
 with


Jensen,
 dude.
 Jensen
 did
 an
 interview
 on


Fox
 this
 morning.
 Great
 interview.
 Uh


said
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 that
 I
 think
 is


really
 important.
 The
 big
 headline
 for


uh
 Nvidia
 is
 that
 on
 Friday,
 this
 was


after
 the
 market
 closed.
 I
 think
 right


when
 the
 market
 close
 ended,
 we
 shared


the
 headline.
 Uh
 Nvidia
 and
 TSMC
 have


officially
 developed
 the
 wafer
 for
 the


Blackwell
 chip
 in
 America
 for
 the
 first


time
 ever.
 So
 this
 is
 what
 Jensen
 had
 to


say
 about
 that
 and
 how
 he
 went
 further


into
 the
 re-industrialization


of
 America
 for
 semiconductors.


>> Sunday
 briefing.


Honor
 to
 have
 you
 here.


>> It's
 great
 to
 be
 here,
 Peter.


>> So
 when
 President
 Trump
 first
 announced


tariffs
 earlier
 this
 year,
 your
 company


was
 hit
 pretty
 hard.
 On
 Friday,
 though,


you
 announced
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 start


making
 the
 wafers
 for
 AI
 chips
 in
 the


United
 States.
 Can
 you
 tell
 us
 more


about
 what
 your
 plan
 is?


Yeah,
 this
 last
 week
 was
 a
 historic


week.
 Uh
 we
 manufactured
 the
 most


advanced
 AI
 chips
 in
 the
 world
 in
 the


most
 advanced
 fab
 in
 the
 world
 here
 in


America
 for
 the
 first
 time.
 Uh
 all
 of


this
 started
 with
 President
 Trump


wanting
 to
 reindustrialize
 the
 United


States.
 His
 terrorist
 was
 a
 pressing
 uh


agent
 in
 making
 this
 possible
 at
 this
 at


the
 at
 the
 speed
 that
 we're
 doing.


Jensen
 just
 said
 his
 tariffs
 were
 a


pressing
 agent
 in
 making
 this
 happen.
 So


you
 got
 Jensen
 giving
 Trump
 a
 lot
 of


credit
 right
 there
 saying
 the
 tariffs


are
 the
 reason
 why
 we're
 able
 to
 do


this.
 That's
 probably
 what
 Trump
 wants


to
 hear.
 It's,
 you
 know,
 good
 for
 Nvidia


shareholders
 for
 him
 kind
 of
 staying


aligned
 that
 way.
 And
 obviously
 for
 the


American
 re-industrialization
 project


around
 semiconductors,
 Jensen
 is
 leading


the
 way.
 He's
 also
 glazing
 a
 bit,
 but


you
 know,
 he's
 trying
 to
 get
 his
 company


to
 10
 trillion,
 so
 it's
 what
 you
 got
 to


do.
 And
 now
 at
 uh
 uh
 just
 in
 shortly


after
 less
 than
 a
 year,
 we're
 now


manufacturing
 the
 most
 advanced
 chips


for
 AI
 here
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 This


is
 just
 the
 beginning
 of
 it.
 Uh
 with
 the


partnership
 of
 the
 supply
 chain
 in


Taiwan,
 TSMC
 is
 in incredible
 partner
 in


a
 strategic
 partner
 for
 United
 States


and
 in
 bringing
 manufacturing
 of
 the


most
 in
 most
 critical
 sector
 of


technology
 here
 to
 to
 United
 States.
 Uh


this
 is
 just
 the
 starting
 point
 where


after
 that
 with
 Foxcon,
 Amcor,
 Spill,
 uh


Wistron,
 so
 many
 of
 our
 other
 partners,


we're
 going
 to
 bring
 the
 entire


>> Amcore
 mention.
 We
 got
 the
 Amcore


mention.
 One
 of
 the
 only
 companies
 that


can
 do
 packaging
 in
 the
 United
 States,


works
 very
 closely
 with
 TSM.
 Trades
 at


1.15
 time
 sales.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's


going
 to
 work
 out,
 but
 Jensen's
 not


mentioning
 that
 many
 seven
 billion


dollar
 companies
 in
 these
 interviews.


entire
 supply
 chain
 of
 building
 AI


infrastructure
 back
 here
 in
 the
 United


States.
 By
 the
 end
 of
 uh
 the
 next
 three


or
 four
 years,
 we'll
 probably


manufacture
 we're
 on
 on
 target
 to


manufacture
 about
 half
 a
 trillion


dollars
 of
 AI
 supercomputing
 technology


to
 be
 installed
 here
 in
 the
 United


States.


>> And
 you
 were
 in
 Arizona
 at
 the
 plant
 on


Friday.
 You
 said
 there
 that
 this
 is
 the


single
 most
 important
 chip
 being


produced
 in
 America.
 What
 does
 it
 do


that
 makes
 you
 say
 that?


Well,
 Nvidia
 is
 at
 the
 epicenter.
 We're


the
 engine
 of
 the
 largest
 industrial


revolution
 uh
 in
 human
 history.
 The
 last


ones
 were
 steam
 engine,
 electricity,


information
 technology.
 And
 now
 we're


creating
 artificial
 intelligence,


digital
 intelligence
 that
 augments
 all


of
 the
 things
 that
 we
 do.
 It's
 going
 to


affect
 every
 single
 industry.
 There's


not
 one
 industry
 that's
 not
 affected
 by


intelligence,
 of
 course.
 And
 so
 this
 is


going
 to
 revolutionize
 every
 single


industry.
 We're
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 that


industrial
 revolution.
 We've


manufactured
 now
 several
 hundred
 billion


dollars
 of
 this
 chip
 called
 Blackwell.


You
 apply
 electricity
 to
 it.
 It


processes
 you
 know
 information
 and
 what


comes
 out
 of
 it
 is
 digital
 intelligence.


It's
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 miracle
 thing
 and
 uh


it's
 hard
 to
 understand
 kind
 of
 like


electricity
 back
 in
 the
 old
 days.
 uh
 but


soon
 AI
 will
 be
 everywhere
 uh
 in
 the


world
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 used
 by
 every


company.
 It'll
 be
 used
 by
 every
 industry


and
 this
 Blackwell
 chip
 is
 the
 engine
 of


that
 artificial
 intelligence.
 And
 so


we're
 super
 excited
 that
 we're


manufacturing
 that
 for
 the
 very
 first


time
 here
 in
 America.


>> In
 the
 last
 3
 years
 or
 so,
 and
 we
 can


put
 this
 up
 on
 the
 screen,
 your


company's
 stock
 is
 up
 1,500%


because
 of
 the
 surge
 in
 AI
 demand.
 Is


that
 sustainable
 or
 are
 we
 in
 an
 AI


bubble?


>> We're
 actually
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 this


industrial
 revolution.
 The
 way
 to
 think


about
 AI
 is
 that
 in
 order
 for
 AI
 to
 be


produced,
 you
 need
 a
 factory.
 That


factory
 takes
 energy.
 This
 is
 one
 of
 the


most
 important
 things
 that
 President


Trump
 did
 for
 the
 technology
 industry


here
 in
 the
 United
 States
 is
 to


recognize
 that
 energy
 is
 necessary
 for


this
 industry
 to
 grow.
 President
 Trump's


pro-energy
 initiatives
 has
 made
 it


possible
 for
 us
 to
 sustain
 our
 growth.


You
 take
 the
 energy,
 you
 put
 it
 into


these
 AI
 factories
 and
 it
 produces


digital
 intelligence.
 We're
 about


hundred
 couple
 hundred
 billion
 dollars


into
 this
 journey.
 We
 have
 trillions
 of


dollars
 of
 AI
 infrastructure
 to
 build


throughout
 the
 next
 decade.
 And
 so
 this


is
 a
 just
 in
 the
 very
 very
 beginning


part
 of
 that
 journey.
 Uh
 we
 know
 that
 AI


and
 you
 were
 just
 talking
 about
 this.
 It


is
 going
 to
 replace
 millions
 of
 people's


jobs
 basically
 in
 the
 next
 couple
 years.


But
 you
 now
 are
 saying
 that
 the
 next


generation
 of
 US
 millionaires
 are
 going


to
 be
 plumbers
 and
 electricians.
 We
 have


a
 lot
 of
 plumbers
 and
 electricians


watching
 right
 now.
 Why
 is
 it
 that
 you


say
 that
 they
 are
 going
 to
 become


millionaires?


Well,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 build
 these


magnificent
 factories.
 Magn
 magnificent


factories
 for
 chips,
 for
 packaging,
 for


these
 AI
 supercomputers,
 but
 also
 for


these
 factories
 that
 are
 producing


digital
 intelligence.
 All
 of
 these


factories
 requires
 extraordinary
 skilled


craft.
 This
 is
 something
 that
 that
 uh


our
 country
 needs
 to
 to
 really
 really


celebrate
 that
 the
 the
 the
 the
 skill


craft
 professions
 are
 are
 severely
 um
 uh


underresourced.
 We
 just
 don't
 have


nearly
 enough
 of
 them.
 Plumbers,


electricians,
 uh
 technicians,
 networking


networking
 technicians
 building
 out


these
 incredible
 factories.
 We
 need
 a


lot
 of
 them.
 Hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of


them,
 maybe
 even
 millions
 of
 them.
 And


so
 we're
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 this
 new


industrial
 revolution.
 And
 any


industrial
 revolution
 requires
 skilled


craft.
 And
 I
 really
 appreciate
 the
 the


work
 that
 was
 done
 in
 Arizona.
 In
 fact,


if
 you
 look
 at
 Arizona
 in
 just
 a
 very


short
 period
 of
 time,
 we
 went
 from


groundbreaking
 to
 standing
 up
 this


incredible
 advanced
 fab
 with
 TSMC
 and


all
 of
 the
 professionals
 and
 all
 the
 the


workers
 in
 Arizona.
 uh
 they
 came


together
 to
 build
 uh
 the
 world's
 first


our
 first
 AI
 chip
 here
 in
 America.
 So
 I


really
 appreciate
 all
 the
 effort
 they


put
 into
 it.
 They
 worked
 around
 the


clock.
 It's
 incredible
 what
 they've


done.


>> And
 so
 I
 mean
 look,
 you've
 got
 Jensen


obviously
 very
 bullish
 on
 this
 AI


revolution.
 You
 know
 what
 else
 is
 he


going
 to
 say?
 He's
 he's
 also
 talking
 his


book.
 But
 Nvidia
 is
 putting
 up
 the


growth
 to
 be
 able
 to
 justify
 that
 which


is,
 you
 know,
 why
 it
 is
 more
 believable


than
 not.
 Last
 week
 HSBC
 updated
 Nvidia


or
 upgraded
 them
 to
 320.
 uh
 they
 which


would
 be
 a
 $7.5
 trillion
 company.
 So
 you


got
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 Wall
 Street
 firms


saying,
 "Look,
 we
 agree
 with
 Jensen.


It's
 not
 a
 bubble.
 We
 indeed
 are
 at
 the


beginning.
 We
 think
 Nvidia
 is
 going
 to


do
 350
 billion
 of
 revenue
 in
 2027.
 The


street's
 at
 250.
 And
 we
 think
 they're


going to
 do
 $11
 of
 EPS.
 The
 street's
 at


eight
 bucks.
 So
 if
 they
 were
 able
 to
 put


up
 those
 numbers,
 like
 it
 just
 again


doesn't
 really
 feel
 that
 the
 bubble


argument
 has
 as
 much
 weight.
 Now,
 one


argument
 to
 support,
 not
 the
 bubble


argument,
 but
 rather
 the
 argument
 that


maybe
 Nvidia
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


put
 up
 that
 growth
 is
 the
 lack
 of


selling
 in
 China.
 Here's
 what
 Jensen


said
 a
 couple
 days
 ago
 uh
 about
 China.


Obviously,
 he's
 super
 bullish
 for


America,
 and
 what
 he's
 saying
 about


jobs,
 manufacturing,
 all
 of that
 is


music
 to
 Trump's
 ears.
 But
 this
 was
 when


he
 took
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 different


approach
 uh
 implicitly
 criticizing
 that


Nvidia
 should
 be
 able
 to
 sell
 into


China.


>> We
 hope
 that
 we
 could
 create
 American


technology
 that
 the
 world's
 built
 upon.


Well,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 AI
 researchers
 are
 in


China.
 You
 know,
 China
 has
 about
 50%
 of


the
 world's
 AI
 researchers.
 Uh,


incredible
 schools,
 incredible
 focus
 in


AI,
 lots
 of
 passion
 around
 AI.
 And
 I


think
 it's
 a
 mistake
 to
 not
 have
 those


researchers
 build
 AI
 on
 American


technology


>> on
 first
 principles.
 I
 think
 that's
 a


mistake.
 And
 so
 the
 question
 is
 how
 how


do
 you
 balance
 winning
 staying
 ahead
 on


the
 other
 hand
 ensuring
 that
 the
 world


builds
 on
 American
 tech
 stack
 that's
 the


balance


and
 in
 order
 to
 balance
 you
 have
 to
 have


nuance


and
 it
 it's
 probably
 not
 you
 know
 all
 or


nothing
 and
 so
 nuance
 a
 nuance
 strategy


that
 that
 that
 um
 uh
 changes
 that
 that


um
 uh
 you
 know
 is
 is
 a


uh
 changing
 over
 time
 uh
 has
 a
 a
 you


know
 that
 allows
 United
 States
 to
 stay


ahead
 while
 we
 continue
 to
 win


researchers
 around
 the
 world
 is
 probably


the
 right
 balance
 and
 and
 that
 that's


what
 I
 would
 advocate
 at
 the
 moment
 uh


we
 are
 100%
 out
 of
 China
 and
 so
 China
 is


0%
 of
 we
 went
 from
 95%
 market
 share
 to


0%


>> and
 so
 I
 can't
 imagine
 any
 policy
 maker


thinking
 that
 that's
 a
 good
 idea


that
 whatever
 policy
 we
 implemented


uh
 caused
 one
 of
 caused
 America
 to
 lose


one
 of
 the
 largest
 markets
 in
 the
 world


to
 0%.
 But
 anyhow,
 in
 all
 of
 our


forecast,
 if
 there
 are
 any
 shareholders


out
 there,
 all
 of
 our
 forecast,
 we're


we're
 assuming
 zero
 zero
 for
 China.
 If


anything
 happens
 in
 China,
 which
 I
 hope


it
 will,
 it'll
 be
 a
 bonus.
 But
 it's
 a


large
 market.
 Uh
 China
 is
 the
 second


largest
 computer
 market
 in
 the
 world.


So
 look,
 he
 wants
 to
 sell
 into
 China
 and


the
 reason
 he
 wants
 to
 sell
 into
 China


is
 obviously
 to,
 you
 know,
 help
 Nvidia's


growth,
 but
 also
 because
 he
 does
 believe


and
 I
 think
 Jensen
 is
 pretty
 authentic


about
 this.
 I
 mean,
 like,
 yes,
 obviously


he
 wants
 to
 increase
 Nvidia's
 earnings,


but
 he
 does
 also
 think
 that
 the
 Chinese


are
 very
 sophisticated.
 He
 has
 a
 lot
 of


respect
 for
 the
 Chinese
 and
 if
 another


deepseek
 moment
 happens
 which
 who
 knows


anything
 could
 happen
 and
 it's
 not
 being


built
 on
 Nvidia
 but
 it's
 China
 that's


getting
 the
 upper
 hand
 that
 obviously


would
 not
 be
 a
 good
 thing
 for
 American


manufacturing
 and
 American
 technology.


Now
 Sham
 Sanker
 CTO
 of
 Palunteer
 he


wrote
 an
 article
 uh
 on
 Friday
 and
 the


title
 is
 why
 the
 China
 dubs
 are
 wrong.


the
 original
 title
 why
 it
 was
 Jensen


Huang
 is
 wrong
 about
 China
 and
 I
 think


that
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 well
 it
 got
 a
 lot
 of


clicks
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 seeing
 what


Sham
 is
 saying
 but
 they
 kind
 of
 changed


it
 to
 why
 the
 China
 dub
 is
 wrong.
 I


think
 the
 print
 version
 came
 out
 with
 uh


the
 actual
 headline
 which
 is
 what
 was


the
 one
 it
 was
 uh


Jensen
 Jensen
 Huang
 is
 wrong
 about


China.
 Yeah.
 So
 look
 what
 what
 did
 Sham


say
 if
 you
 read
 the
 article?
 It's
 not


really
 a
 critique
 of
 Jensen
 per
 se.
 It's


not
 even
 like
 a
 hey
 Nvidia
 sucks
 or


anything.
 Sham
 clarified
 his
 thoughts


after
 he
 posted
 the
 article
 saying


Nvidia
 is
 a
 great
 you
 know
 American


company.
 It's
 rather
 the
 question
 of


dude
 this
 is
 not
 a
 joke
 like
 we
 are
 in
 a


moment
 with
 China
 that
 if
 we
 don't


figure
 out
 how
 to
 resolve
 it
 aka
 create


all
 of
 the
 stuff
 that
 we
 need
 to
 we
 need


to
 create
 for
 ourselves
 to
 survive
 which


is
 semiconductors
 first
 and
 foremost


pharmaceuticals
 labor
 that
 can't
 be


outsourced
 and
 ruin
 American
 jobs.
 All


of
 that
 stuff
 is
 super
 super
 important.


And
 as
 you
 can
 see,
 Shawn
 right
 here


said,
 "Nvity
 is
 a
 great
 American
 company


and
 Jensen
 is
 a
 great
 American


entrepreneur
 who
 cares
 deeply
 about
 our


country.
 This
 is
 about
 the
 CCP
 and
 what


they
 continue
 to
 do
 to
 undermine


America."
 If
 you
 listen
 to
 Palmer
 Lucky


on
 Joe
 Rogan,
 he
 said,
 "Uh,
 China's


invading
 Taiwan
 by
 2027."
 Now,
 I
 don't


know
 if
 that's
 going
 to
 happen.
 I
 really


hope
 it
 doesn't
 because


that
 would
 suck.
 But
 they're
 going
 to


have
 a
 lot
 of
 problems
 to
 worry
 about


when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 forget
 the
 stock


market.
 We're
 just
 going
 to
 have
 a
 bunch


of
 issues.
 But
 like
 if
 that
 were
 to


happen,
 you
 know,
 this
 this
 is
 not
 even


a
 discussion
 anymore.
 We
 would
 be
 in
 a


full-on
 war
 and
 that
 would
 not
 be
 the


best
 situation
 to
 be
 in.
 So
 I
 think
 what


Sham
 has
 been
 trying
 to
 say
 and
 what


he's
 been
 talking
 about
 really
 for
 the


past
 couple
 years
 now
 is
 the
 Chinese


Communist
 Party
 is
 not
 someone
 that
 we


can
 easily
 negotiate
 with
 and
 we
 have
 to


have
 a
 hardline
 stance
 which
 I
 would


imagine
 he
 is
 uh
 on
 the
 side
 of
 Trump
 in


terms
 of
 how
 aggressive
 he's
 being
 with


China
 and
 to
 Sham
 who
 probably
 you
 know


might
 not
 have
 the
 same
 type
 of
 interest


as
 an
 Nvidia
 shareholder.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 Sham
 owns
 Nvidia
 or
 not,
 but
 he
 might


be
 thinking,
 look,
 the
 justification
 of


Nvidia
 selling
 chips
 to
 increase
 the


American
 tech
 stack
 is
 not
 a
 good
 enough


justification
 for
 America
 giving
 out
 our


technology.
 There's
 a
 counter


perspective
 to
 that,
 but
 I,
 you
 know,


some
 people
 on
 Twitter
 tried
 to
 frame
 it


as
 like
 Sham
 saying
 we
 need
 to
 get
 into


a
 war
 with
 China,
 and
 you
 can
 obviously


tell
 they
 didn't
 read
 the
 article.
 I


don't
 think
 anyone
 would
 be
 advocating


for
 a
 war
 and
 Sham
 did
 not
 advocate
 for


a
 war
 but
 rather
 he
 said
 look
 there
 are


some
 serious
 structural
 issues
 and
 we


need
 to
 talk
 about
 that
 in
 a
 way
 that
 is


not
 the
 most
 dovish
 about
 China
 which
 I


think
 is
 very
 important
 and
 you
 know
 for


those
 that
 think
 it's
 fear-mongering


okay
 but
 Russia
 did
 invade
 Ukraine
 like


if
 and
 if
 if
 you
 for
 anyone
 who
 really


thinks
 it's
 fear
 mongering
 you
 should


watch
 the
 60
 Minutes
 CBS
 uh
 episode
 on


Taiwan
 they
 did
 this
 I
 think
 late
 23


early
 24
 might
 have
 been
 mid
 2023
 it's


it's
 on
 YouTube
 just
 type
 in
 CBS60


Minutes
 Taiwan
 and
 you'll
 have
 the
 head


officials
 from
 the
 defense
 ministry
 to


the
 prime
 minister
 saying
 it
 is
 not
 a


question
 of
 if
 it
 is
 a
 question
 of
 when.


So
 they
 take
 it
 very
 seriously.
 You
 know


we
 in
 the
 west
 tend
 to
 be
 a
 little bit


more
 subsidized
 from
 having
 to
 worry


about
 that
 stuff
 but
 it's
 definitely
 not


something
 that
 you
 know
 shouldn't
 be


worried
 about.
 So
 regardless
 you
 got


Jensen
 advocating
 for
 American


manufacturing
 but
 you
 also
 have
 Jensen


advocating
 for
 Nvidia
 being
 able
 to
 sell


into
 China.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we're
 going


to
 get
 to
 sell
 into
 China.
 I
 quite


frankly
 think
 Trump
 is
 holding
 on
 to


that
 last
 bargaining
 chip
 metaphorically


and
 literally
 that
 he
 has
 with
 the


Chinese
 which
 is
 Nvidia.
 There's


probably
 a
 reason
 they
 you
 know
 we


haven't
 fully
 lifted
 the
 export
 controls


and
 until
 we
 get
 to
 a
 meaningful


negotiation
 I
 don't
 think
 we're
 going
 to


which
 might
 take
 until
 mid
 2026.
 So
 that


60
 billion
 potential
 guide
 that
 Jensen


gave
 out
 for
 if
 we
 get
 China
 revenue


that's
 not
 happening
 in
 Q3.
 I
 think
 it


would
 be
 very
 unlikely.
 maybe
 second


half
 of
 2026
 if
 the
 China
 stuff
 is


resolved,


but
 ultimately
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to


see
 how
 this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 So,


that's
 what
 we
 have
 on
 Nvidia
 and
 that's


what
 we've
 got
 going
 on.
 All right,
 we


got
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 headlines.
 Let's


get
 into
 those
 and
 we'll
 see
 what
 else


we
 got
 going
 on.
 Again,
 the
 Amcor


mentioned
 was
 also
 pretty
 cool.
 Um,
 it


was
 nice
 to
 see
 Amcore,
 $7
 billion


company,
 get
 that
 mention.
 Again,


there's
 not
 many
 companies
 in
 the
 supply


chain
 in
 America
 in
 particular,
 and


Amcore
 is
 one
 of
 them.
 By
 the
 way,


before
 we
 move
 on
 to
 some
 of
 these


headlines,
 I
 did
 want
 to
 play
 this
 video


cuz
 I
 don't
 think
 any
 of
 us,
 at least


this
 video
 was
 new
 to
 me,
 have
 seen
 what


it
 looks
 like
 to
 build
 these
 chips.
 This


is
 inside
 TSM's
 factory
 in
 America.
 Uh,


and
 I
 think
 it's
 worth
 just
 taking
 a


look
 at
 what
 actually
 happens
 to
 build


all
 these
 semiconductors.


>> Our
 clean
 room
 is
 just
 massive.
 I
 get


goosebumps.


The
 first
 hallway
 that
 you
 find
 is
 what


we
 call
 the
 silver
 highway.


>> What
 we're
 looking
 at
 right
 now
 is
 the


automated
 material
 handling
 system.
 We


have
 about
 700
 unified
 pods
 that
 carry


the
 wafers.


>> They're
 flying
 through
 the
 fab


[Music]


and
 they're
 just
 speeding
 up
 and
 down


and
 zipping
 left
 and
 right,
 going


everywhere,
 going
 to
 a
 tool,
 dropping
 it


down.
 I
 use
 them
 every
 single
 day
 for


thousands
 of
 my
 wafers
 going
 to


anything.


As
 far
 as
 how
 to
 make
 a
 semiconductor,


I
 think
 it's
 still
 kind
 of
 magic
 to
 a


lot
 of
 people.


>> In
 each
 one
 of
 these
 machines,
 there
 is


a
 lot
 of
 high-tech
 going
 on.


Plasma
 ignites.


Molecules
 and
 atoms
 move
 around.
 We
 can


fit
 billions
 of
 transistors
 on
 a
 single


chip.
 One
 transistor
 is
 10
 to
 20,000


times
 smaller
 than
 a
 human
 hair.


>> To
 be
 able
 to
 do
 this
 is
 incredibly


difficult.
 We
 are
 tricking
 light
 using


extreme
 ultraviolet
 technologies
 to
 be


able
 to
 print
 line
 widths
 at
 that


geometry.
 It
 really
 blows
 the
 mind.
 You


stand
 in
 front
 of
 something
 that
 has
 as


many
 transistors


as
 the
 stars
 in
 a
 galaxy.


To
 make
 these
 chips
 exist,
 we
 try
 to


make
 the
 impossible
 possible.
 This
 is


the
 job
 of
 an
 engineer
 here.


>> All
 the
 technology
 that
 we
 take
 for


granted,


it
 would
 not
 have
 been
 made
 possible


without
 semiconductors.
 Everything


around
 us
 has
 a
 chip
 inside
 it.


>> All
 that
 we
 use,
 the
 way
 we
 live,
 the


way
 we
 work,
 those
 chips,
 guess
 what?


TSMC
 makes
 most
 of
 those.


>> The
 technology
 that
 we're
 working
 on


here
 is
 the
 building
 block
 of
 so
 many


innovations
 going
 on
 around
 the
 world


right
 now.


>> This
 technology
 is
 making
 AI
 a
 real


thing.
 You
 need
 these
 really
 advanced


chips
 for
 those
 that
 nobody
 else
 can


make
 but
 TSMC.


It's
 quite
 incredible,
 dude.
 It's
 quite


freaking
 incredible.
 We
 get
 to
 be
 alive


during
 the
 time
 where
 this
 is
 happening.


And
 this
 is
 the
 worst
 it's
 ever
 going
 to


be.
 The
 chips,
 this
 is
 the
 worst
 the


chips
 are
 ever
 going to
 be.
 This
 is
 the


worst
 the
 results
 of
 what
 the
 chips


produce,
 aka
 the
 tokens
 and
 the
 actual


intelligence
 is
 going
 to
 be.
 Like,
 it's


only
 getting
 better
 from
 here.
 It's
 only


getting
 more
 sophisticated
 from
 here.


It's
 only
 developing
 in
 more
 uh


intricate
 ways
 in
 regards
 to
 the


manufacturing
 process
 from
 here.
 And
 as


a
 result,
 we
 as
 investors,
 I
 think,
 have


one
 of
 the
 greatest
 opportunities
 of
 a


lifetime.
 I
 mean,
 you
 need
 for
 a


industrial
 revolution,
 you
 need
 the


excitement
 of
 the
 output
 of
 that


revolution,
 in
 this
 case
 AI,
 and
 you


also
 need
 the
 excitement
 from
 an


investor
 base
 that
 is
 willing
 to
 take
 a


bet
 on
 that
 future.
 And
 you
 know,
 based


on
 what
 Jensen
 says,
 he
 thinks
 we're
 in


the
 very
 beginning
 of
 that
 journey.
 Now,


the
 stock
 prices
 may
 not
 feel
 like
 we're


in
 the
 beginning
 of
 that
 journey,
 which


is
 why
 you
 have
 all
 the
 talk
 of
 the


bubble,
 but


if
 the
 earnings
 continue
 to
 grow,
 and


we're
 going
 to,
 you
 know,
 find
 out
 this


week
 how
 much
 these
 earnings
 are


growing,
 TSM,
 TSM,
 MT,
 and
 uh
 TSMC
 and


ASML
 already
 kind
 of
 gave
 us
 a
 glimpse


of
 how
 much
 it's
 not
 slowing
 down.


Again,
 57%
 of
 TSM's
 revenue
 was
 high


margin
 GPU
 chips,
 not
 cell
 phones,
 which


is
 just
 going
 to
 show
 you
 that
 this


business
 really
 isn't
 slowing
 down.
 And


again,
 if
 you
 listen
 to
 the
 earnings


call,
 they
 continue
 to
 say
 that
 this
 is


not
 a
 demand
 problem.
 This
 is
 them
 being


able
 to
 build
 out
 as
 many
 fabs
 as


possible
 to
 make
 this
 happen.


So,
 it's
 pretty
 cool.
 It's
 pretty
 cool.


Relle
 says,
 "This
 is
 the
 worst
 it's
 ever


going to
 be,
 only
 if
 we're
 not
 killed
 by


a
 meteor."
 Yes.
 You
 know,
 I
 had
 a
 dream.


I
 had
 a
 dream
 last
 night
 that
 a
 nuclear


bomb
 was
 dropped.


And
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 it
 is
 about
 my


dreams.
 I
 have
 had,
 dude,
 since
 I
 was


freaking
 14
 years
 old,
 I've
 had
 this


dream
 that
 a
 nuclear
 bomb
 is
 dropped.


And
 that
 that
 wakes
 you
 up,
 right?


Because
 you're
 not
 really
 allowed
 to
 die


in
 your
 dream.
 And
 I've
 had
 this
 dream


like
 three
 or
 four
 times
 that
 someone


drops
 a
 nuke
 and
 then
 the
 you
 know
 when


like
 when
 a
 nuke
 explodes
 like
 it
 it
 it


re
 re
 what's
 the
 word?
 Re
 reverbates.


That's
 probably
 not
 the
 word,
 but
 like


it
 it
 starts
 spreading
 and
 then


eventually
 it's
 going
 to
 spread
 to
 you,


right?
 And
 you're
 going
 to
 like


disintegrate
 because
 it's
 going
 to
 kill


you.
 And
 as
 soon
 as
 it
 gets
 ready
 to


come
 to
 me
 and
 you
 see
 the
 light,
 boom,


I
 wake
 up
 and
 I
 wake
 up
 and
 I'm
 like,


"Well,
 that
 wasn't
 pleasant.
 Someone


just
 dropped
 a
 nuke."
 Like,
 I
 don't
 know


why
 this
 has
 happened
 in
 my
 dream
 so


many
 times,
 bro.
 But
 it's
 a
 shock
 wave.


That's
 what
 it's
 called,
 but
 it's


happened.
 No
 way.
 I've
 had
 this,
 too.


Maybe
 some
 of
 you
 guys
 have
 have
 felt


this,
 but
 I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 weird.
 But


the
 the
 crazy
 thing
 is
 like
 if
 we
 don't


have
 a
 crazy
 pandemic
 again
 or
 or
 a


nuclear
 war
 or
 China
 invading
 Taiwan,
 I


mean
 the
 next
 10
 years
 should
 be


relatively
 strong
 in
 terms
 of
 the


overall
 GDP
 growth
 of
 society.
 Yeah,
 the


mushroom
 cloud.
 And
 if
 that's
 the
 case,


um
 you
 know,
 hopefully
 this
 is
 what


hopefully
 this
 is
 how
 it
 ends
 up
 playing


out
 to
 be
 pretty
 exciting.
 I
 did
 not


watch
 Terminator
 2
 yet,
 even
 though
 so


many
 of
 you
 guys
 say
 it's
 a
 better
 movie


than
 not.
 Jose
 says
 nukes
 time
 to
 go


long.
 Maybe
 that's
 maybe
 it's
 telling
 me


to
 just
 buy
 Oaklo,
 bro.
 Maybe
 that's


what
 my
 dreams
 have
 been.
 I
 mean,
 been


having
 these
 dreams
 for
 a
 while.
 Know


about
 Oaklo
 for
 a
 while,
 so
 I
 might
 as


well
 have
 pulled
 the
 trigger
 there.


Oaklo
 down
 about
 1%
 right
 there.


But
 again,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 one
 of
 those


things
 where
 as
 long
 as
 we
 don't
 have


some
 massive
 screw-up
 globally
 and
 some


world
 war
 like
 this
 is
 a
 revolution
 that


is
 happening
 in
 front
 of
 us
 and
 everyone


wants
 to
 be
 part
 of
 it.
 the
 Chinese,
 the


Japanese,
 the
 the
 Middle
 Eastern,
 I
 mean


like
 everyone
 across
 the
 world


understands
 this
 is
 the
 next
 growth


curve
 and
 everyone's
 trying
 to
 hop
 onto


it.
 By
 the
 way,
 the
 Nikkay
 up
 1.5%.
 So


very
 nice
 to
 see
 Japanese
 markets
 up


1.5.
 Year
 to
 date,
 Japan
 up
 23%


absolutely
 crushing
 the
 S&P.
 We'll
 see


how
 the
 S&P
 performs
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 year
 if
 we
 can
 get
 back
 uh
 back
 to


back
 to
 back
 20%
 years,
 three
 in
 a
 row.


But
 you
 got
 the
 NK


that
 is
 green
 as
 well.
 All
 right.
 So,


uh,
 that's
 what
 we
 had
 with
 Jensen.
 Oh,


last
 thing
 I'll
 say
 on
 this, this,
 we'll


get
 on
 to
 all
 the
 other
 macro
 headlines.


Here
 was
 Trump
 this
 morning
 about
 China


and
 what
 he's
 thinking
 going
 into
 this


negotiation.


>> I'm
 wondering
 what
 China
 is
 thinking


right
 now.
 Did
 Xi
 Jinping
 congratulate


you
 about
 the
 success
 of
 the
 peace
 deal?


>> Well,
 I
 heard
 he
 did.
 There
 was
 a


statement
 put
 out,
 but


>> because
 in
 the
 middle
 of


>> a
 meeting
 with
 him,


>> he
 squeezed
 the
 US
 by
 tightening
 the


export
 controls
 on
 rare
 earth
 minerals.


>> He
 did.
 and
 I
 raised
 our
 tariffs
 to
 100%


uh
 on
 top
 of
 what
 they're
 already


paying,
 which
 is
 far
 worse.
 Far
 worse.


We'll
 see
 what
 happens
 with
 China.
 I've


always
 had
 a
 great
 relationship
 with


them,
 as
 you
 know,


but
 uh


they're
 always
 looking
 for
 an
 edge.
 You


know,
 they
 ripped
 off
 our
 country
 for


years.
 They
 they
 made
 with
 with
 uh
 Bush,


with
 everybody.
 They
 made
 Obama
 was


terrible.
 Terrible.


And
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 I
 really
 liked
 Ronald


Reagan.
 I
 loved
 him
 as
 a
 president,
 but


he
 was
 not
 good
 on
 trade.
 He
 really


wasn't
 good
 on
 trade.
 On
 trade,
 he


wasn't
 good.
 But
 he
 was
 uh
 good
 in
 many


ways.
 But
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 that
 China
 in


particular,
 boy,
 they
 did
 a
 number
 on


our
 country.
 They
 would
 they
 they
 took


money
 out.
 Now
 it
 it's
 reversed.
 I
 mean,


you
 know,
 we're
 doing
 very
 well
 with


China.
 I
 don't
 know
 what's
 going
 to


happen.
 I
 can't
 tell
 you.
 We're
 going
 to


meet
 in
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks.
 We're
 going


to
 meet
 in
 South
 Korea
 actually
 with


President
 Xi
 and
 other
 people
 too.
 But


we're
 going
 to
 meet
 we
 have
 separate


meeting
 set
 up.


>> If
 you
 put
 that
 100%
 tariff
 on
 top
 of


what's
 in
 place
 already
 157%
 tariff
 on


China,
 can
 that
 stand?
 What
 is
 that


going
 to
 do
 to
 the
 economy?


>> It's
 not
 sustainable,
 but
 um
 that's
 what


the
 number
 is.
 It's
 probably
 not.
 You


know,
 it
 could
 stand.


But
 uh
 they
 forced
 me
 to
 do
 that.
 I


think
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 fine
 with
 China.


I
 get
 along
 great
 with
 him.
 He's
 a
 very


strong
 leader,
 a
 very
 uh,
 you
 know,


amazing
 man.
 You
 look
 at
 what
 he's
 done


and
 what
 he's,
 you
 know,
 where
 he's
 his


life
 is
 is
 an
 amazing
 story.
 It's
 a


story.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 the
 point
 is,
 you
 can


tell
 in
 that
 clip.
 I
 mean,
 he
 doesn't


sound
 the
 most
 aggressive
 with
 China


right
 there.
 His
 tweets
 last
 week
 were
 a


bit
 more
 aggressive
 in
 regards
 to,
 I'm


going to
 tariff
 them
 100%
 and
 they
 can't


keep
 doing
 this
 to
 us
 and
 we're
 not


buying
 the
 soybeans.
 And
 then
 in
 that


interview
 this
 morning,
 he's
 like,


"Well,
 you
 know,
 I
 like
 China.
 I'll


figure
 out
 a
 way
 to
 work
 with
 them.
 I


think
 everything
 will
 be
 okay."
 So,
 I


think
 that's
 another
 reason
 the
 markets,


at least
 the
 futures
 right
 here,
 are


relatively
 flat
 to
 green.
 I
 mean,
 no


one's
 necessarily
 freaking
 out
 as
 much


about
 China
 as
 they
 were
 during
 the


week.
 And
 if
 you
 do
 freak
 out
 about
 it,


I
 mean,
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 market
 will
 be


a
 very
 temporary
 freakout
 because
 they


know
 that
 we
 need
 China.
 China
 needs
 us.


Uh,
 on
 Thursday
 night,
 China
 said


decoupling
 from
 the
 US
 would
 be


irrational
 and
 not
 possible.
 So
 you
 got


the
 Chinese
 foreign
 ministry
 as
 well
 not


saying
 that
 you
 know
 they
 want
 to


decouple
 from
 us
 because
 they
 can't
 and


they
 know
 they
 can't.
 And
 so
 I
 think


that
 threat
 of
 whatever
 people
 think


could
 you
 know
 really
 mess
 up
 this
 rally


is
 out
 there.
 It's
 possible
 but
 it
 might


not
 be
 as
 meaningful
 as
 some
 people


think.
 Tesla
 right
 there
 442
 that's
 up


63%.
 You
 got
 pound
 share
 up8
 and
 then


Robin
 Hood
 131.80.
 We
 do
 have
 a
 report


right
 here
 from
 Bloomberg
 saying
 Trump


mentions
 US
 is
 thinking
 about
 purchasing


beef
 from
 Argentina.
 that
 came
 out


literally
 four
 minutes
 ago.
 Uh
 Trump


might
 be
 talking
 to
 the
 press
 near
 Air


Force
 One.
 So
 we
 might
 get
 some
 footage


probably
 in
 like
 10
 20
 minutes
 from
 that


and
 we
 might
 get
 some
 more
 quotes.
 But


Bloomberg
 says
 Trump
 is
 thinking
 of


purchasing
 beef
 from
 Argentina.
 Probably


a
 little
 bit
 more
 leverage
 he's
 trying


to
 gain
 on
 China.


And
 that
 is
 one
 update
 we
 have
 from


Trump.


I
 didn't
 know
 Argentina
 was
 a
 big


exporter
 of
 beef.
 I
 mean,
 didn't
 Trump


Trump
 Yeah.
 Trump
 on
 Tuesday
 or
 Thursday


said
 that


we're
 gonna
 get
 the
 beef
 prices
 down


dramatically.
 So,
 maybe
 Argentina
 is


going
 to
 be
 key
 to
 to
 getting
 those
 beef


prices
 down.
 All right,
 so
 let's
 get


into


let's
 get
 into
 some
 of the
 other


headlines
 we
 got
 going
 on
 and
 we
 will


keep
 going
 from
 there.
 I
 mean,
 we
 got
 a


little
 bit
 of
 red
 in
 the
 futures
 right


here,
 but
 again,
 futures
 were
 relatively


flattish
 to
 green
 to
 start
 uh
 when
 we


got
 into
 overnight.
 So,
 you
 got
 the
 S&P


going
 down
 46
 cents.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 wasn't


up
 that
 much
 in
 the
 first
 place,
 but
 663


right
 there
 on
 the
 S&P


and
 that
 one's
 slightly
 right.
 Is


Bitcoin
 giving
 up
 108,
 Bitcoin
 107?


Yeah,
 look,
 here's
 the
 thing
 before
 we


get
 into
 headlines.
 I
 think
 the
 the


playbook
 for
 this
 week
 is
 I
 mean,
 let's


do
 a
 poll
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat.
 But,


um,
 I
 think
 it's
 gonna
 be
 choppy,
 dude.


Instead
 of
 October,
 I
 think
 we're
 having


Choptober.
 I
 think
 we
 are
 having


Choptober.
 Green
 or
 red
 this
 week.
 And


the
 reason
 for
 that
 is
 because
 a
 October


tends
 to
 be
 volatile
 and
 we
 had
 two


really
 good
 months,
 August,
 September.


So
 we're
 kind
 of
 due
 for
 some


choppiness.
 And
 then
 b
 it's
 like
 we
 need


a
 lot
 more
 good
 news
 to
 start
 of


culminating
 and
 intersecting
 with
 each


other
 for
 the
 uh
 excitement
 I
 think
 that


it
 would
 take
 for
 us
 to
 get
 to
 7,000
 on


the
 S&P.
 And
 you
 know,
 we
 listened
 to


Tom
 Lee
 on
 Friday.
 He
 had
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 arguments
 for
 why
 S&P
 7,000
 is


still
 intact.
 I
 agree
 with
 a
 far


majority
 of
 them.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 number


one
 thing
 we're
 missing
 right
 now,
 we


need
 earnings,
 bro.
 We
 need
 earnings.
 We


need
 really
 good
 earnings.
 And
 until
 we


get
 those
 earnings,
 I
 don't
 know
 if


we're
 necessarily
 going
 to
 even
 have
 a


chance
 to
 expand
 the
 multiple.
 Now,
 the


bank
 earnings
 have
 been
 good.
 A
 couple


tech
 companies
 have
 put
 up
 good


earnings,
 but
 Google,
 Microsoft,
 Amazon,


I
 mean,
 these
 are
 the
 guys
 that
 really


have
 to
 show
 that
 there's
 not
 an
 issue,


that
 there's
 not
 a
 threat
 of
 a
 bubble.


Although
 you
 did,
 I
 mean,
 we'll
 get
 into


this
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 the
 headlines,


but
 Satia
 Nadella
 said
 some
 stuff
 over


the
 weekend
 that
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 people


wondering
 about
 OpenAI.
 Um,
 but
 yeah,
 I


think
 it's
 going to
 be
 choppy
 this
 week.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 have
 no
 idea.
 I
 mean,
 a


lot
 of
 us
 thought
 October
 would
 be


green,
 but
 then
 again,
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 also


recognized
 that
 September
 and
 August


were
 so
 green
 that
 we
 probably
 were
 due


for
 somewhat
 of
 a
 pullback.
 And
 look,


670
 to
 663
 is
 just
 not
 the
 biggest


pullback
 in
 the
 world.
 It
 just
 is
 more


painful
 because
 we
 haven't
 experienced


it
 in
 so
 long.
 And
 so
 I
 think


emotionally
 we
 just
 have
 to
 learn
 how
 to


navigate
 it.
 But
 like
 logically
 this
 is


nothing.
 670
 to
 663


if
 we
 go
 back
 to
 655
 that's
 just
 it's


nothing.
 It
 literally
 is
 nothing.
 It's


what
 happens
 all
 the
 time.
 And
 so
 until


we
 see
 some
 major
 levels
 break
 you
 know


640
 and
 below


the
 chop
 is
 likely
 healthy


which
 hopefully
 sets
 us
 up
 for
 a
 good


November
 December.
 All
 right
 let's
 get


into
 some
 headlines.
 Uh,
 this
 one
 a
 lot


of
 people
 are
 going
 to
 be
 surprised
 by.


A
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 going
 to
 say
 a


three-letter
 word
 as
 soon
 as
 I
 say
 it,


but
 nonetheless,


uh,
 here
 it
 is.
 Chamath,
 Don
 Trump
 Jr.,


and
 Laura
 Ingram
 are
 launching
 a
 new


spa.


Did
 Did
 you
 Didn't
 think
 you'd
 be


hearing
 that
 tonight,
 did
 you?
 You


didn't
 think
 you'd
 be
 hearing
 that


tonight.
 The
 spa
 is
 in
 the
 the
 Cayman


Islands.
 Uh,
 Lauren
 Ingram,
 for
 those


that
 don't
 know,
 she
 has
 a
 show
 on
 Fox.


Don
 Trump
 Jr.
 is
 Trump's
 son
 and
 then


Chamath
 is
 the
 the
 king
 of
 Spaxs.
 Um
 it


is
 called
 Colombia
 Acquisition
 Corp.
 Uh


none
 of
 these
 three
 people
 will
 be
 the


CEO.
 Omid
 Malik
 will
 be
 the
 CEO.
 He
 has


ties
 to
 all
 three
 of
 these
 people
 and
 uh


mainly
 Don
 Jr.
 I
 mean
 it
 seems
 like
 Don


Jr.
 is
 the
 one
 who's
 kind
 of


spearheading
 the
 effort
 on
 this.
 I
 don't


know
 why
 Chimat's
 in
 it.
 I
 don't
 know


why
 Lauren
 Ingram
 is
 in
 it,
 but
 they're


in
 it.
 Blake
 Masters,
 he's
 a
 very
 close


confidant
 of
 Peter
 Teal.
 He's
 on
 the


board
 of
 directors
 as
 well.
 Like
 it's


very
 confusing
 who
 they
 pulled
 together


to
 do
 this,
 but
 they're
 doing
 it.
 And
 I


went
 on
 the
 uh
 SEC
 filing
 and
 I
 command


FedEd
 casino
 because
 Chimat's
 last
 spack


had
 a
 warning
 that
 was
 no
 crying
 in
 the


casino.
 And
 when
 I
 command
 FedEd
 it,
 I


got
 zero
 for
 zero.
 Meaning
 there's
 not
 a


you
 can't
 see
 the
 command
 F
 right
 there,


but
 if
 you
 try
 to
 command
 F,
 I'll
 put


the
 link
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat.
 There


is
 no
 warning
 to
 retail
 investors
 that


you
 cannot
 cry
 in
 the
 casino.
 I
 thought


there
 might
 be
 a
 warning,
 but
 there
 is


no
 warning.
 So,
 this
 is
 not
 the
 same


chamat
 that
 he's
 leading
 American


Exceptional
 Corporation,
 which
 is


actually
 a
 much
 better
 deal.
 He
 doesn't


get
 paid
 unless
 the
 stock
 moves
 up
 50%.


There's
 no
 additional
 warrants.
 There


can't
 be
 any
 dilution.
 Like,
 there
 is
 a


lot
 of
 guard
 rails
 that
 were
 way
 better


than
 2021.
 This
 [ __ ]
 I
 don't
 know


what's
 going
 on
 with
 this
 [ __ ]
 Like,
 I


saw
 this
 headline
 today
 and
 I
 was
 just


like,
 "Okay,
 so
 I
 guess
 these
 three


are
 are
 bringing
 some
 innovative
 company


to
 the
 uh
 to
 the
 masses
 here.
 So,


look,
 I
 know
 people
 want
 to
 say
 top


here,
 but
 the
 the
 point
 is
 if
 this
 thing


goes
 to
 zero,
 it
 probably
 doesn't
 affect


the
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 market,
 but
 the


fact
 that
 this
 is
 here,
 I
 don't
 know,


dude.
 Like,
 what
 what
 could
 they


possibly
 be
 bringing
 public?
 Like,
 like


what
 is
 it
 going
 to
 is
 it
 going to
 be


another
 grab
 a
 gun?
 Is
 it
 going
 to
 be


another
 gun
 shop
 online
 comp?
 Like,
 it's


going
 to
 be
 a
 media
 network
 for


conservatives.
 like
 what
 is
 this?
 Cayman


Islands
 already
 is
 just
 like
 okay.
 So


it's
 like
 I
 don't
 know.


It's
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 kind
 of
 weird,
 but


we'll
 see
 whenever
 that
 ends
 up
 coming


out.
 There's
 no
 ticker,
 by
 the
 way.


There's
 no
 ticker,
 but
 the
 official
 name


is
 Colombia
 Acquisition
 Corp.
 And
 when


we
 get
 the
 ticker,
 we'll
 probably
 get


some
 more
 updates
 on
 this.
 It
 was
 filed


October
 17th,
 so
 it
 was
 filed
 two
 days


ago.
 And
 uh
 those
 are
 the
 details.
 All


right,
 so
 a
 Bitcoin
 casino.
 I
 mean,


maybe.
 Why
 not,
 right?
 Why
 freaking
 not


a
 Bitcoin
 casino?
 All
 right,
 let's
 get


to
 some
 other
 headlines.
 Gold.
 So,
 gold


now
 accounts
 for
 over
 20%
 of
 global


central
 bank
 reserves,
 the
 highest
 share


we've
 seen
 in
 nearly
 three
 decades.
 Gold


has
 been
 crazy.
 Uh
 I
 think
 all
 of
 us
 are


still
 kind
 of
 struggling
 to
 understand


what
 is
 happening
 with
 gold.
 Why
 is
 it


running
 in
 the
 way
 that
 it's
 running?


And
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 reason
 quite
 frankly
 is


not
 only
 because
 of
 Tether
 trying
 to


tokenize
 gold,
 which
 is
 something
 we


discussed
 last
 week,
 but
 also
 the
 idea


of
 central
 banks
 thinking
 that
 gold
 is


the
 new
 treasury
 or
 the
 the
 the
 quote


unquote
 new
 US
 10-year
 Treasury.
 And


because
 of
 how
 liquid
 gold
 is
 becoming,


because
 of
 how
 many
 inflows
 are
 coming


into
 gold,
 especially
 from
 retail


investors
 as
 well,
 that
 you
 know,
 if
 you


go
 to
 your
 local
 Costco,
 their
 gold
 bars


are
 just
 getting
 sold
 out
 every
 single


day.
 It's
 quite
 incredible
 to
 see
 this


playing
 out.
 The
 fact
 that
 central
 bank


gold
 holdings
 are
 rising
 to
 me
 could
 be


potentially
 putting
 out
 the
 argument


that
 gold
 is
 not
 just
 becoming
 a
 trade.


Gold
 is
 becoming
 a
 legitimate
 way
 that


central
 banks
 are
 thinking
 of
 assets.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 saying
 there's
 a
 bubble
 in


gold.
 Maybe
 there's
 not.
 If
 it
 has
 that


much
 liquidity,
 maybe
 it's
 not.
 Now,


gold
 did
 tank
 tank.
 Look,
 I'm
 becoming


like
 you
 guys,
 bro.
 Saying
 tank
 over


everything.
 Gold
 is
 up
 a
 little
 bit


right
 now,
 but
 gold
 did
 go
 down
 from


like
 4380
 down
 to
 4238.
 I
 mean,
 so
 it
 is


down
 a
 little
 bit,
 but
 still
 up
 7
 of
 65%


for
 the
 year.
 Silver
 from
 53
 to
 51,
 not


that
 big
 of
 a
 deal.
 Still
 at
 51.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know.
 If
 gold
 is


this
 much
 a
 part
 of
 central
 bank


reserves,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 slows
 it


down
 outside
 of
 people
 feeling
 that,
 you


know,
 outside
 of
 people
 getting
 so


euphoric
 about
 gold
 that
 it
 becomes
 a


legit
 bubble
 or
 the
 idea
 that
 gold


um
 the
 the
 idea
 that
 gold
 is
 not
 as


attractive
 as
 an
 investment
 opportunity


because
 maybe,
 you
 know,
 it's
 run
 up
 so


much
 people
 are
 just
 not
 interested.
 I


mean,
 the
 fact
 that
 Bitcoin
 is
 up
 20%


this
 year
 and
 freaking
 gold
 is
 up
 70%.


Goes
 to
 show
 you
 how
 insane
 this
 rally


has
 been.
 So
 either
 it's
 going
 to


attract
 more
 and
 more
 inflows
 on
 dips
 or


people
 are
 going
 to
 say
 you
 know what


gold
 is
 just
 not
 the
 space
 I
 should
 be


in
 because
 you
 know
 why
 would
 I
 waste
 my


time
 being
 in
 gold
 given
 how
 much
 it's


run


but
 ultimately
 we're
 going to
 have
 to


see
 how
 it
 plays
 out.
 Here's
 a
 clip
 from


the
 compounding
 friends
 talking
 with
 an


expert
 on
 commodities
 on
 what's
 going
 on


with
 gold
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from


there.


>> This
 we've
 never
 seen
 this
 before.


>> I
 mean
 I
 I
 am
 I
 am
 you
 can't
 not
 be


surprised
 at
 the
 velocity.
 Gold
 is
 up


60%
 on
 the
 year.


>> Well,
 the
 the
 velocity
 of
 the
 move


that's
 taken
 place
 just
 over
 the
 last
 3


to
 6
 weeks
 is
 is
 absurd.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 in


a
 good
 way.
 It
 that's
 got
 to
 be
 a
 little


surprising
 for
 anybody.
 But,
 I
 mean,
 you


go
 back
 to
 the
 turn
 of
 the
 year
 and
 you


start
 seeing
 what
 was
 bubbling
 up
 in


gold
 and
 and
 we
 get
 to
 3000
 and
 and
 you


see
 Trump
 policies
 and
 you
 see
 the


ddollarization.


um
 you
 see
 the
 central
 bank
 buying


consistently
 central
 bank
 buying
 uh
 and


uh
 basil
 3
 you
 know
 which
 actually
 took


effect
 in
 July
 of
 2025
 so
 it's
 now


officially
 a
 tier
 one
 asset
 on
 central


bank
 balance
 sheets
 you
 look
 at
 that
 I


mean
 our
 thesis
 was
 gold's
 going to
 go


to
 5,000
 we
 just
 didn't
 think
 that
 this


is
 going
 to
 happen
 this


>> it
 would
 happen
 by
 Christmas


>> yeah
 okay
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 the


trajectory
 that
 we're
 on


>> yeah
 there
 no
 one's
 selling


>> well
 there
 well
 there
 is
 no
 reason
 to


sell
 I
 mean
 the
 most
 of
 the
 buying
 is


coming
 from
 central
 banks
 and
 they're


putting
 on
 their
 balance
 sheet
 and
 it's


a
 move
 away
 from
 the
 dollar
 and
 there's


there's
 you
 know
 we
 think
 there's
 proof


that
 that
 China
 has
 understated
 their


their
 gold
 reserves
 by
 20%.


>> You
 think
 they're
 quietly
 accumulating


>> quietly?
 Oh
 yeah,
 certainly.
 And
 okay


and
 so
 I
 I I
 think
 if
 gold
 and
 I've
 sat


I've
 sat
 down
 with
 a
 with
 a
 a
 CEO
 in
 in


the
 gold
 mining
 space
 and
 he
 asked
 me,


Bill,
 what
 would
 make
 this
 what
 would


what
 would
 what
 would
 ruin
 this?
 What


what
 could
 make
 it
 go
 down?


>> What
 would
 ruin
 this
 uptrend
 in
 gold?


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 I
 and
 I
 I
 I
 said
 at
 the


end
 of the
 day,
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 what


would
 because
 the
 massive
 selling
 that


would
 take
 this
 away
 would
 have
 to
 come


from
 central
 banks
 and
 they're
 not


selling.
 What
 we
 could
 get
 though,
 I


mean,
 we
 could
 certainly
 get
 a
 10%
 and


this
 at
 the
 time
 gold
 was
 at
 3500
 to


3,700
 or
 so
 is
 just
 breaking
 out
 and


yeah,
 we
 could
 get
 a
 10%
 move,
 you
 know,


probably
 if
 just
 deleveraging.
 Maybe
 at


this
 point
 it
 could
 be
 a
 20%
 move.
 I
 was


going
 to
 tell
 you
 the
 only
 thing
 that


ruins
 this
 is
 a
 global
 recession
 where


these
 central
 banks
 are
 forced
 to
 sell


gold
 in
 order
 to
 do
 stimulus
 in
 their


own
 countries
 because
 that
 is
 literally


what
 ended
 the
 gold
 bull
 market
 in
 2011.


>> So
 Josh
 is
 absolutely
 right
 about
 that.


In
 2011
 when
 you
 had
 more
 stimulus
 a
 lot


of
 these
 central
 banks
 had
 to
 end
 up


selling
 gold
 to
 be
 able
 to
 finance
 the


stimulus.
 if
 we
 avoid
 a
 global


recession,
 which
 I
 mean,
 who
 knows?
 But


if
 we
 do
 for
 the
 next
 couple
 years,
 and


you
 know,
 the
 reason
 the
 gold
 bubble


popped
 in
 2011
 and
 didn't
 even
 recover


until
 2020
 is
 because
 of
 a
 recession.
 If


we
 avoid
 a
 recession,
 maybe
 gold
 really


doesn't
 need
 a
 reason
 to
 get
 liquidated.


European
 sovereigns,
 Asians,
 or
 they
 all


so
 like,


>> but
 how
 does
 that
 change
 if
 it's
 a
 tier


one
 asset
 now
 on
 their
 balance
 sheet?
 It


is
 as
 good
 as
 cash.


>> Yes.
 But
 if
 you
 need
 the
 money,
 you
 need


the
 money.


>> Yeah.


>> The
 other
 thing
 that
 could
 end
 it
 is
 if


people
 get
 too
 excited
 about
 gold.


>> Yeah.


>> Like
 big
 leverage
 coming
 in
 on
 the
 long


side.
 I
 don't know.
 Phil
 Phil
 probably


has
 like
 better
 better
 guesses
 than
 I


do,
 but
 like
 it
 it
 eventually
 does
 end,


but
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 end
 for
 10
 years.


Like
 there's
 no


>> it
 could
 be
 a
 big
 cycle
 here
 right
 now.


>> It
 could
 be
 a
 big
 deal,
 right?


>> It
 definitely.
 And
 I
 and
 I
 I
 think
 what


could
 end
 it?
 I
 mean,
 there
 could


obviously
 be
 a
 number
 of
 things.
 And
 you


look
 back
 even
 co
 and
 I
 remember
 that
 it


was
 like
 the
 first
 week
 of
 March


whenever
 that
 Monday
 coming
 out
 of
 the


oil
 Saudi
 Arabia
 and
 Russia
 oil
 news
 and


oil's
 down
 10
 bucks.
 Gold
 made
 a
 high


that
 morning
 but
 then
 within
 weeks
 and


in
 the
 co
 shutdowns
 it
 was
 I
 think
 300


bucks.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 1,700
 to,400.
 And


so
 gold
 really
 sniffs
 out
 inflation
 and


it
 doesn't
 it
 may
 not
 react
 how
 you


would
 expect
 during
 the
 inflation.
 Like


in
 2022,
 Fed's
 hiking
 rates,
 the
 dollar


is
 strengthening,
 gold
 was
 whacked,
 but


it
 smells
 inflation.
 So
 it's
 going
 to


it's
 going
 to
 see
 it
 and
 it's
 going
 to


react
 prior
 to
 the
 inflation.
 So
 I
 would


say
 what
 we're
 seeing
 right
 now


potentially
 could
 be
 more
 inflation
 but


then
 you're
 also
 getting
 the
 GDPs
 of
 of


Germany
 and
 Japan
 and
 things
 like
 that


that
 the
 dollar
 is
 actually
 rising
 in


and
 over
 this
 last
 week
 last
 couple
 of


weeks
 when
 gold's
 been
 breaking
 out


which
 is
 a
 pretty
 interesting
 phenomena.


>> That's
 rare.


>> Now
 the
 weird
 thing
 about
 this
 is
 again


and
 this
 is
 what
 we
 were
 talking
 about


with
 Chris
 on
 macro
 Thursday
 he
 was


saying
 hey
 you
 know
 gold
 going
 up
 is
 a


sign
 of
 inflation.
 The
 problem
 is
 the


tenure
 is
 coming
 down
 and
 so
 the
 tenure


is
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 right
 now
 but
 we
 were


below
 4%
 and
 the
 the
 tenure
 coming
 down


is
 a
 sign
 of
 the
 the
 credit
 market


saying
 we
 don't
 think
 inflation
 is
 going


to
 rise
 as
 aggressively
 and
 we
 want
 to


lock
 in
 our
 rate.
 We're
 not,
 you
 know,


commanding
 a
 premium
 from
 the
 the
 the


bond
 market
 on
 giving
 us
 a
 better


interest
 rate
 because
 we
 think
 inflation


is
 going
 up
 and
 so
 they're
 locking
 in


their
 rates
 which
 is
 why
 bonds
 are


coming
 down
 as
 more
 people
 buy
 them.
 But


gold's
 going
 up
 which
 is
 the
 exact


opposite
 thesis.
 So
 it's
 weird,
 right?


It's
 like
 it's
 it's
 just
 like
 it's
 a


very
 weird
 set
 of
 events
 that
 have


happened.
 Gold
 usually
 doesn't
 go
 up
 70%


in
 a
 year.
 Neither
 does
 silver.
 Copper


is
 up,
 I
 think,
 30%
 this
 year.
 And
 and


you
 know,
 one
 could
 argue
 that
 yes,
 a


lot
 of these
 commodities
 are
 going to
 be


needed
 as
 well
 in
 data
 centers,
 which
 is


a
 fair
 point.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think,
 you
 know,


the
 large
 majority
 of
 these
 central


banks
 that
 are
 buying
 it
 aren't
 really


buying
 it
 on
 the
 data
 center
 thesis.
 So,


you
 know,
 it's
 something
 to
 keep
 track


of
 if
 you
 own
 silver
 and
 gold.
 I
 mean,


you've
 had
 a
 really
 good
 year.
 I
 know
 a


lot
 of
 people
 are
 more
 into
 tech
 stocks


and
 equities
 and
 not
 necessarily
 into


commodities.
 I'm,
 you
 know,
 definitely


not
 a
 commodities
 investor.
 I
 I
 need
 to


learn
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 them.
 But
 this


has
 been
 a
 historic
 year,
 an
 absolute


historic
 year.
 And
 yeah,
 platinum


all-time
 highs
 as
 well.
 And
 it's
 pretty


incredible
 to
 see
 this
 happening
 in


front
 of
 us.
 IN
 right
 there
 up
 5%
 the


overnight
 markets.
 Futures
 flip
 green.


S&P
 goes
 green
 again
 almost
 665.
 Nvidia


slightly
 red.
 Tesla's
 up.
 Pounder's
 up.


Hood
 is
 up.
 You
 got
 all
 these
 names
 that


are
 starting
 to
 go
 back
 green.
 All


right,
 Tesla.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 Tesla.


So,
 we've
 got
 earnings
 coming
 up
 on


Wednesday.
 Uh,
 I'm
 going
 to
 put
 a
 poll


right
 here
 in
 the
 chat.
 By
 the
 way,


about
 70%
 of
 you
 said
 we
 would
 go
 green


for
 the
 week.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how


this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 Tesla
 pump
 or


dump.
 We'll
 do
 a
 bunch
 of
 these
 pumper


dumps
 before
 the
 actual
 earnings.
 What


do
 we
 think?
 Pump
 or
 dump
 on
 Tesla.


Tesla's
 stock
 year
 to
 date
 was
 lagging


heavily
 until
 the
 past
 month.
 It
 is
 now


only
 up
 15%
 year-to-
 date.
 It
 was
 down


at
 1.40%.


So,
 the
 fact
 that
 it's
 up
 is
 good.


Um,
 here's
 my
 perspectives
 on
 Tesla.


First
 of
 all,
 I
 finally
 updated
 to


13.2.9
 on
 FSD,
 um,
 which
 is
 not
 14,
 but


I
 don't
 have
 14
 available
 yet.


Hopefully,
 I
 get
 FSD
 14
 soon.
 I
 will


say,
 uh,
 the
 nagging,
 which
 has
 been
 my


biggest
 gripe
 with
 FSD
 for
 the
 past


couple
 of
 weeks,
 really
 past
 couple


months,
 quite
 frankly,
 is
 starting
 to


get
 way
 better.
 I
 mean,
 and
 I
 don't
 know


if
 it
 was
 just
 me,
 but
 on
 the
 previous


version,
 you
 couldn't
 even
 glance
 at


your
 phone.
 like
 you
 glance
 at
 it
 while


it
 was
 charging
 on
 in
 the
 Tesla
 and
 you


would
 get
 a
 warning
 to
 pay
 attention.


And
 now
 I
 actually
 pick
 up
 my
 phone,
 I


can
 check
 a
 text
 message,
 I
 can
 change


the
 song
 when
 I'm
 looking
 at
 music
 or
 I


can
 look
 outside
 if
 there's
 some
 scenery


and
 when
 I,
 you
 know,
 look
 back
 at
 the


road,
 I
 don't
 have
 this
 massive
 warning


telling
 me
 to
 pay
 attention.
 It's
 gotten


a
 lot
 better.
 A
 lot
 better.
 And
 I'm
 only


on
 13.2.9,
 so
 I
 would
 imagine
 14
 is
 even


better
 than
 this.
 But
 uh
 I
 am
 a
 very


very
 happy
 owner
 of
 a
 Tesla
 as
 for
 the


past
 couple
 days
 of
 not
 having
 to
 deal


with
 the
 absolute
 nonsense
 that
 was
 you


look
 away
 for
 two
 se
 not
 even
 two


seconds
 two
 milliseconds
 and
 boom
 you


get
 hit
 with
 a
 warning.
 So
 I
 think


that's
 really
 good
 that
 has
 changed.
 Now


does
 that
 actually
 affect
 the
 earnings?


Probably
 not
 because
 you
 know
 FSD
 is
 not


something
 that
 they're
 selling
 like


hotcakes
 yet.
 Uh
 I
 think
 what's
 going to


affect
 the
 earnings
 is
 the
 is
 the


delivery.
 So
 they
 delivered
 basically


500,000
 cars,
 497,000


um
 and
 that
 was
 better
 than
 expected.


The
 problem
 is
 I
 think
 everyone
 has


already
 baked
 those
 into
 their


estimates.
 So
 the
 street
 for
 this


earnings
 is
 expecting
 negative
 growth


year-over-year
 again.
 However,
 the


earnings
 they're
 expecting
 are
 44
 cents


of
 EPS
 and
 26.5
 billion
 of
 revenue.


There
 have
 been
 some
 EPS
 revisions
 to


the
 upside,
 about
 17
 of
 them
 over
 the


past
 couple
 months.
 So
 you
 do
 have


analysts
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 more


bullish,
 but


um
 I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 want


to
 be
 super
 bearish
 Tesla.
 I
 just
 don't


know
 if
 anything
 Elon
 can
 say
 will
 be


enough
 to
 actually
 get
 this
 to
 move.
 The


fact
 that
 the
 compensation
 package
 is


going
 to
 be
 voted
 on
 and
 likely
 go
 in


Elon's
 favor.
 The
 fact
 that
 he
 bought
 a


billion
 dollars
 worth
 of
 stock.
 I
 mean,


I
 think
 those
 two
 things
 and
 then
 the


fact
 that
 they
 had
 497,000
 deliveries


because
 of
 the
 EV
 credit
 going
 away
 and


so
 they
 really
 took
 advantage
 of
 that.
 I


think
 all
 three
 of
 those
 things
 are


priced
 in
 and
 it
 really
 helped
 Tesla
 get


from
 330
 where
 it
 was
 stuck
 at
 now
 into


the
 400s
 and
 now
 it's
 kind
 of
 you
 know


in
 that
 420
 to
 450
 range
 and
 I
 would


love
 to
 you
 get
 your
 perspectives
 as


well
 from
 the
 chat.
 What
 could
 Elon


possibly
 say
 no
 not
 forget
 Elon
 because


Elon
 can
 say
 anything
 and
 then
 the
 stock


can
 go
 up
 or
 down.
 What
 can
 Tesla
 the


company
 do
 on
 Wednesday
 that
 will


actually
 get
 the
 stock
 to
 blast
 into
 the


I
 don't
 know
 470s
 480s
 like
 480
 was


where
 it
 was
 at
 December
 I
 guess
 alltime


highs
 we'll
 frame
 it
 like
 that
 and
 and
 I


don't know
 do
 people
 have
 high


expectations
 because
 I
 don't
 I
 really


don't
 and
 I
 don't
 know if
 I
 should
 but


just
 using
 Elon's
 words
 from
 last


quarter
 he
 said
 don't
 expect
 a
 ton
 of


growth
 until
 the
 end
 of
 2026


and
 so
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 move
 on


Tesla
 right
 now
 is
 the
 compensation


package,
 the
 XAI
 shareholder
 vote


potentially
 coming
 true
 and
 uh
 Elon


buying
 a
 billion
 dollars
 of
 stock.
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 really
 fundamentals.


And
 so
 the
 question
 then
 becomes,
 you


know,
 what
 can
 they
 put
 up?
 Energy
 is


going to
 be
 good,
 but
 energy
 doesn't


lead
 to
 the
 bottom
 line
 significantly.


Um
 again,
 the
 deliveries
 are
 already


baked
 in,
 so
 people
 already
 know
 how


much
 they're
 going
 to
 deliver.
 It's


still
 going
 to
 be
 negative


year-over-year
 in
 terms
 of
 earnings


growth.
 And
 then
 revenue
 is
 going
 to
 be


negative
 as
 well.
 They
 still
 have,
 you


know,
 they're
 going
 to
 probably
 have
 38


billion
 in
 cash
 when
 they
 report.


They're
 not
 going
 to
 do
 a
 buyback.
 We


know
 that's
 not
 happening.
 Yes,


optimist.
 And
 I've
 been
 I've
 been
 saying


like
 this
 like
 a
 broken
 record
 over
 the


past
 couple
 of
 at
 this
 point
 I
 would
 say


five
 quarters
 that
 Elon
 needs
 to


announce
 an
 LOI,
 a
 letter
 of
 an
 intent,


a
 letter
 of
 intent
 with
 a
 Walmart
 that


is
 ready
 to
 buy
 100,000
 Optimus.
 Just


even
 the
 announcement
 of
 a
 Walmart
 or
 a


Marta
 Libre
 or
 any
 of
 these
 major


companies
 in
 their
 factories
 are
 ready


to
 to
 to
 you
 know
 buy
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 of
 optimism.
 I
 mean
 it
 doesn't


even
 have
 to
 be
 revenue.
 could
 just
 be
 a


little
 email
 that
 the
 CEO
 of
 Marta
 Libre


sends
 Elon
 like,
 "Hey,
 if
 you
 if
 you
 get


it
 ready
 for
 us,
 we're
 ready
 to
 buy
 it


because
 they
 would
 be
 ready
 to
 buy
 it."


I
 mean,
 they
 would
 obviously
 love
 to


have
 that
 infrastructure
 inside
 of
 their


their
 their
 ecosystem
 and
 supply
 chain,


but
 you
 know,
 it's
 not
 ready
 yet.
 The


robot
 can't
 really
 do
 anything
 yet,


but
 I
 don't
 that
 would
 be
 exciting
 for


him
 to
 announce
 like
 he
 did
 with
 the


semis.
 Okay.
 So,
 yeah,
 like
 look,
 people


are
 waiting
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 things.
 And


then
 the
 other
 catalyst
 that
 we
 didn't


even
 mention
 is
 the
 new
 affordable


vehicles,
 quote
 unquote,
 that
 are
 not


affordable
 in
 my
 opinion
 at
 all.
 I
 mean,


is
 that
 going
 to
 be
 something
 that
 can


get
 the
 stock
 to
 go
 up?
 No,
 not
 really.


I
 don't
 think
 so.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you're


going
 to
 pay
 36,000
 for
 a
 Model
 Y,
 you


might
 as
 well
 pay
 40,000
 for
 like
 I


really
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 just
 a
 weird


thing
 that
 Tesla
 did.
 And
 it
 kind
 of


goes
 against
 what
 their
 mission
 is,


which
 is
 get
 people
 into
 the
 car
 and


then
 monetize
 them
 with
 FSD.
 Like
 a


$4,000
 retracement
 on
 it's
 I
 I
 don't


know.
 I
 really
 don't
 know.
 And
 I'm
 not


even
 trying
 to
 be
 bearish
 here.
 I
 don't


think
 the
 stock
 has
 to
 tank
 because


everything's
 baked
 in.
 So
 if
 they
 have


negative
 earnings
 growth,
 it's
 like,


okay,
 we
 already
 knew
 they
 were
 going
 to


be
 negative.
 But
 does
 the
 stock
 have
 to


explode?
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 would
 the


company
 do
 that
 could
 possibly
 get
 it
 to


explode
 outside
 of
 Elon
 making
 people


feel
 happy
 while
 he's
 talking
 during
 the


earnings
 call,
 which
 he
 does
 every
 time.


And
 then
 in
 a
 couple
 days,
 people
 are


like,
 well,
 Elon
 says
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff.


So
 I
 don't
 know.
 We're
 going
 to
 have
 to


see.
 But
 Mega
 Pac
 major
 beat
 mega
 mega


pack.
 Yeah,
 mega
 pack
 could
 beat
 by
 like


two
 300%.
 It's
 not
 going
 to
 change
 the


bottom
 line,
 right?
 I
 think
 that's
 the


issue.


You
 know,
 they
 could
 grow
 energy
 instead


of
 120%
 by
 like
 190%.
 It's
 just
 like


it's
 going
 to
 add
 very
 incremental
 net


income.
 It's
 just
 not
 going
 to
 make
 a


deal.


So,
 as
 bullish
 as
 unless
 energy,
 you


know,
 unless
 energy,
 unless
 you
 know,


all
 this
 data
 center
 energy
 stuff
 we've


been
 talking
 about,
 Tesla
 obviously
 is


an
 energy
 play
 and
 Tesla's
 going
 to


benefit
 from
 all
 the
 data
 center
 hype


around
 energy,
 which
 is
 not
 really
 hype.


and
 we
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 energy.
 But
 could


they
 come
 out
 with
 a,
 you
 know,
 800%


beat?
 Could
 they
 come
 out
 with
 like
 one


of
 those
 Nvidia
 May
 2023
 quarters
 and


say,
 "Yeah,
 you
 guys
 expected
 us
 to
 do
 1


billion.
 We
 did
 10
 billion."
 Could
 could


that
 actually
 be
 because
 even
 if
 that


doesn't,
 you
 know,
 lead
 to
 the
 bottom


line
 significantly.
 Just
 that
 alone
 on


the
 headline
 could
 get
 people
 to
 think,


wait
 a
 second,
 why
 am
 I
 buying
 all
 these


stupid
 random
 energy
 stocks
 that
 barely


have
 why
 am
 I
 not
 buying
 Tesla
 as
 the


energy
 play?
 I
 mean,
 that
 could
 be
 the


wild
 horse
 here,
 but
 I
 but
 but
 we


already
 know
 how
 many
 gigawatts
 they
 uh


they
 deployed
 in
 in
 12.6,
 I
 think
 it


was,
 which
 is
 up
 double
 year-over-year.


So,
 again,
 you
 we
 kind
 of
 already
 know


the
 answer
 to
 that.
 It's
 not
 going to
 be


that
 massive,


but
 we're
 going
 to
 see.
 We're
 going
 to


see
 where
 it
 plays
 out.
 And
 then
 you


have
 to
 add
 a
 flat
 option.
 It's
 always


pump
 or
 dump.
 It's
 always
 pump
 or
 dump.


You
 got
 to
 make
 a
 choice.


52%
 of
 you
 say
 dump


even
 though
 it's
 probably
 going
 to
 go


flat
 to
 be
 for
 this
 stock.
 It's
 probably


I
 mean
 I
 think
 flat
 would
 be
 the
 best


scenario


to
 be
 honest
 but
 then
 again
 I
 don't


think
 it
 needs
 to
 dump
 like
 why
 does
 it


have
 to
 like
 if
 the
 street's
 willing
 to


give
 it
 a
 premium
 for
 all
 the
 different


reasons
 that
 are
 not
 related
 to
 this
 to


the
 company
 itself
 then
 that's
 fine
 and


people
 are
 willing
 to
 pull
 forward
 the


growth
 before
 FSD
 and
 Optimus
 ramp


that's
 so
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 needs
 to
 go


back
 down
 to
 330
 by
 any
 sense
 of
 the


imagination
 but
 I
 also
 don't
 think
 it


needs
 to
 go
 you
 know
 up
 to
 500.


So,
 Wednesday
 we'll
 be
 live
 and
 we're


going
 to
 see
 uh


we're
 gonna
 see
 how
 this
 ends
 up
 playing


out.
 Well,
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 on
 Tesla.


I
 will
 say
 my
 own
 personal
 opinion
 here,


the
 people
 that
 are
 upset
 that
 Elon
 is


like
 getting
 this
 compensation
 package,


I
 don't
 understand
 it.
 Elon
 gets
 paid
 if


he
 takes
 a
 company
 that's
 worth
 a


trillion
 to
 10
 trillion,
 give
 or
 take
 a


little
 bit
 on
 the
 exact
 numbers,
 but


that's
 the
 point.
 He's
 got
 to
 10x
 the


stock
 and
 people
 are
 complaining
 that


he's
 going
 to
 make
 a
 trillion
 dollars.


It's
 like,
 okay,
 but
 you're
 going
 to


make
 10x,
 too.


If
 you
 buy
 at
 these
 levels,
 whether


it's,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 7.5x,
 8x
 on
 the


exact
 numbers,
 you
 are
 going
 to


substantially
 increase
 your
 investment


at
 the
 same
 time
 that
 Elon's
 going to
 be


getting
 all
 this
 money.
 So,
 like,
 what


are
 we
 talking
 about
 here?
 How
 is
 this


even
 a
 concern?
 This
 is
 the
 most


shareholder
 friendly
 package
 that
 I


think
 we've
 ever
 seen
 on
 Wall
 Street.


And
 it's
 very
 similar
 to
 the
 2018


package,
 which
 he
 completely
 delivered


on.
 S&P
 by
 the
 way,
 665,
 high
 of
 days
 in


the
 overnight
 markets.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know


why
 people
 are
 that
 upset.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 they
 just
 hate
 Elon
 or
 they
 think
 he


doesn't
 deserve
 the
 money.
 I
 mean,
 like,


I
 guess
 the
 trillion
 dollar
 package
 is


what's
 triggering
 people,
 but
 I'm
 like,


you're
 going
 to
 also
 10x
 your


investment.
 Like,
 he
 has
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of


[ __ ]
 done
 for
 him
 to
 make
 a
 trillion


dollars,
 but
 you
 will
 also
 benefit
 by


sitting
 back
 and
 doing
 nothing
 and
 just


letting
 him
 figure
 it
 out.
 And,
 you


know,
 even
 if
 he
 only
 2x's
 or
 3xes
 it


and
 he
 doesn't
 qualify
 for
 the
 trillion,


you're
 still
 up
 two
 to
 300%.
 Like
 I


don't
 understand
 how
 it
 can
 logically
 be


an
 issue
 outside
 of
 him
 not
 executing,


which
 is
 possible,
 but
 if
 he
 does,
 he


deserves
 to
 get
 paid.


So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know
 why


there's
 so
 many
 people
 that
 are
 upset


about
 it,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 uh
 that


should
 work
 out.
 BMR
 right
 there,
 5134,


that's
 up
 2.9%.
 ELF
 down
 a
 little
 bit,


Apple
 down
 a
 little
 bit.
 ETH
 trying
 to


push

 again,
 3939.
 And
 then
 Bitcoin


back
 up
 to
 108.
 Okay,
 we
 got
 some
 Trump


quotes.
 Do
 we
 have
 the
 video
 yet?
 Let
 me


see.
 We
 are
 getting
 some
 Trump
 quotes


in.


Um,


he
 must
 have
 been
 talking.


Oh,
 he's
 he's
 probably
 leaving
 Mara
 Lago


and
 that's
 where
 he
 was
 probably
 talking


on
 Air
 Force
 One.
 Okay,
 we
 got
 some


quotes.
 Soybean
 quotes.
 All right,


soybean
 quotes.
 May
 maybe
 Oh,
 that's
 why


that's
 why
 the
 S&P
 just
 went
 green.


Okay,
 here
 are
 the
 quotes.
 Here
 are
 the


quotes.


Okay,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 quotes,
 dude.
 We


got
 a
 lot
 of
 quotes.
 All right,
 here
 we


go.
 You
 guys
 can
 see
 this.
 All
 right.


Uh,
 Trump
 says
 US
 is
 considering
 buying


beef
 from
 Argentina.
 Trump
 will
 announce


Colombia
 tariff
 rate
 tomorrow.
 Trump


speaks
 to
 reporters
 aboard
 Air
 Force


One.
 Okay,
 that's
 what
 I
 thought
 on
 the


plane.
 Uh,
 Trump
 says
 Modi
 had
 told
 him


he's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 the
 Russian


oil
 thing.


Trump
 says
 India
 will
 continue
 to
 pay


massive
 tariffs
 if
 they
 don't
 restrict


Russian
 oil
 purchases.
 Okay,
 a
 little


bit
 of
 hostility
 with
 oil
 or
 with
 India.


Trump
 says,
 "Do
 not
 want
 China
 to
 pay


rare
 earth
 game
 with
 us."
 Trump
 says
 we


can
 lower
 what
 China
 has
 to
 pay
 in


tariffs,
 but
 China
 has
 to
 do
 things
 for


us,
 too.
 Aka,
 we're
 willing
 to


negotiate.
 That's
 bullish.
 Trump


confident
 of
 reaching
 soybean
 deal
 with


China.


Okay.
 The
 soybeans
 took
 away
 uh


Wednesday's
 green
 close
 from
 us
 and


they're
 giving
 us
 a
 Sunday
 overnight


green
 overnight
 market
 open
 green
 as
 uh


as
 Trump
 gets
 friendly
 on
 the
 soybeans.


Look
 at
 that.
 S&P


66530.


Nvidia's
 up,
 Tesla's
 up,
 pounders
 up,


hoodie's
 up.
 Even
 Grab
 is
 moving
 2%
 on


this.
 Reddit's
 up.
 Amazon's
 up.
 Dude,
 we


better
 enjoy
 it
 now.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


we're
 ever
 going
 to
 have
 a
 market
 cycle


with
 a
 president
 like
 this.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 we're
 ever
 going
 to
 have
 the
 ability


to
 lose
 money
 and
 make
 money
 in
 such
 a


fragile


and
 uh
 I
 guess
 I
 guess
 spontaneous
 way


than
 with
 Trump
 as
 president.
 This
 is


what
 we
 got.


This
 is
 what
 we
 got.
 All
 right.
 So
 Trump


saying
 good
 stuff.
 Confident
 of
 reaching


soybe
 soybean
 deal
 with
 China.
 We
 can


lower
 the
 China
 tariffs.
 China
 has
 to
 do


things
 for
 us
 too.
 Trump
 just
 says
 China


does
 not
 should
 not
 play
 rare
 earth
 game


with
 us.
 All
 three
 of
 those
 things
 to
 me


seem
 relatively
 bullish
 in
 getting
 a


deal
 with
 these
 guys.
 They're
 going
 to


be
 meeting
 November
 1st
 in
 Seoul.


So
 hopefully
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 we


can
 like
 definitively
 finally
 have
 a


deal
 with
 China
 and
 we
 can
 put
 this
 past


maybe.


But


hopefully
 that's
 what's
 going
 to
 happen.


All
 right,
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 I'll


see
 if
 I
 can
 get
 some
 of
 that
 footage
 in


a
 bit.
 should
 be
 probably
 posted
 in
 like


10
 minutes
 and
 then
 uh


we
 can
 see
 what
 Trump
 we
 can
 see
 what


Trump
 had
 to
 say.
 Um
 okay,
 so
 let's
 go


to
 Oh,
 I
 already
 got
 some
 clips
 right


here.
 Hold
 on.
 I
 already
 got
 some
 clips.


Do
 I
 have
 the
 soybean
 clip?


No,
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 soybean
 clip.
 Okay,


I
 have a
 couple
 clips,
 but
 not
 the


soybean
 one.
 So,
 we'll
 when
 that's


posted,
 we'll
 uh
 we'll
 pull
 it
 up.
 All


right,
 so
 some
 other
 headlines.
 Uh


leveraged
 ETFs.
 We
 talked
 about
 this


last
 week.
 Leverage
 ETFs
 continue
 to


grow
 massively.


Uh
 we
 are
 at
 an
 all-time
 high
 on
 the


number
 of
 leveraged
 equity
 ETFs
 that
 are


out
 there.
 As
 you
 can
 see
 right
 there,


October
 2025
 all
 the
 way
 from
 2011.
 We


have
 never
 had
 these
 many
 leveraged


ETFs.
 Now,
 last
 week
 the
 big
 headline


was
 5x
 leveraged
 ETFs
 are
 getting
 ready


to
 come
 into
 the
 system,
 which
 is
 going


to
 be
 kind
 of
 crazy.


um


5x
 leverage.
 If
 the
 stock
 goes
 down
 10%,


you
 know,
 the
 the
 the
 the
 ETF
 would
 go


down
 50%.
 However,
 adding
 to
 the


leverage
 quite
 literally
 is
 this
 stat


that
 came
 out
 over
 the
 weekend
 as
 well,


which
 is
 the
 expansion
 of
 margin
 loans.


So,
 US
 margin
 debt
 has
 hit
 1.13


trillion,
 which
 is
 a
 new
 all-time
 high.


In
 2021,
 it
 was
 900
 billion.
 So,
 we
 are


well
 above
 the
 2021
 highs
 of
 margin


debt.
 Now,
 why
 does
 this
 matter?


Well,
 if
 things
 start
 going
 down
 and


people
 get
 margin
 called,
 they
 will
 have


to
 sell
 equities
 to
 cover
 their
 margin


and
 that
 creates
 an
 onslaught
 of
 more


selling.
 Every
 time
 we've
 had
 historical


margin
 highs,
 as
 you
 can
 see
 on
 the


chart,
 it
 was
 a
 top
 March
 2000,
 July


2007,
 July
 2007,
 May
 2018
 that
 started,


you
 know,
 the
 20%
 decline
 going
 into
 the


end
 of
 the
 year.
 Um,
 October
 2021,
 and


now
 September
 2025.
 Now,
 do
 we
 need
 to


have
 a
 cataclysmic
 crash
 because
 margin


is
 higher
 this
 time?
 I
 don't
 necessarily


think
 so.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 we've


already
 covered
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 nuances


between
 this
 market
 in
 2021.
 I
 think
 two


weeks
 ago,
 I
 went
 on
 an
 entire
 rant


about
 2021's
 promise
 of
 technology.
 It


was
 web
 3.0.
 0
 which
 was
 absolute


garbage
 compared
 to
 AI.
 So
 like
 there's


a
 reason
 people
 are
 going
 on
 margin
 to


buy
 these
 tech
 stocks
 because
 they
 see


the
 actual
 growth
 potential
 and
 so


obviously
 there
 is
 a
 fundamentally


differentiated
 way
 of
 thinking
 of
 the


nature
 of
 this
 market
 but
 nonetheless


it's
 not
 something
 to
 ignore
 when


there's
 that
 much
 margin
 in
 the
 system.


There's
 going
 to
 be
 people
 that
 are


potentially
 going
 to
 have
 to
 deal
 if
 we


have
 any
 level
 of
 a
 pullback
 with


getting
 margin
 called.
 Uh
 so
 it's


definitely
 something
 to
 pay
 attention


to.
 And
 speaking
 of
 margin
 calls,
 even


though
 last
 week
 there
 are
 probably


people
 that
 got
 some
 margin
 calls,
 take


a
 look
 at
 what
 Bank
 of
 America
 showed,


investors
 had
 their
 largest
 inflow
 last


week
 in
 technology
 stocks
 last
 week.


Last
 week,
 which
 was
 the
 recovery
 week


sort
 of
 after
 the
 the
 the
 original
 Trump


Truth
 Social
 Post.
 Uh
 last
 week
 you
 had


soybeans,
 you
 had
 a
 bunch
 of
 random


comments
 about
 cooking
 oil
 with
 Trump


and
 you
 had,
 you
 know,
 threats
 with


India.
 you
 had
 all
 these
 different


headlines
 and
 still
 tech
 stocks


was
 what
 everyone
 loaded
 up
 on.
 This
 is


retail
 and
 institutional.


So
 I
 mean
 look
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 it


does
 not
 seem
 like
 the
 market
 wants
 to


stop
 buying
 Nvidia
 and
 Amazon
 and


Palunteer
 and
 Tesla
 and
 all
 these


phenomenal
 companies
 and
 as
 long
 as


these
 guys
 can
 put
 up
 the
 earnings


growth
 which
 is
 most
 importantly
 what's


going
 to
 make
 the
 justification
 of
 all


these
 inflows
 and
 potentially
 inflows
 on


margin
 make
 sense
 uh
 then
 then
 I
 think


we're
 going
 to
 be
 okay.
 S&P
 500
 right


there
 up
 16%
 but
 they've
 got
 to
 put
 up


the
 earnings
 and
 that's
 why
 this
 earning


cycle
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very
 very
 important


to
 see
 it
 to
 play
 out.
 If
 you
 limit


margin
 to
 only
 a
 small
 percentage
 to
 buy


max
 seven
 companies
 is
 really
 that


risky.
 Look
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 different


philosophies
 on
 margin
 uh
 you
 know
 and


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 sophisticated


ways
 that
 people
 use
 it.
 I
 would
 say
 if


you're
 taking
 out
 margin
 and
 then
 you're


buying
 something
 super
 speculative,


which
 unfortunately
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 be


honest
 is
 the
 majority
 of
 people,
 like


the
 majority
 of
 people
 get
 access
 to


what
 they
 think
 is
 free
 money
 from
 their


brokerage
 and
 they
 think,
 "Oh,
 let
 me


just
 take
 this
 and
 gamble
 on
 XYZ,
 buy


zero
 DTE
 options,
 which
 by
 the
 way
 are


still
 at
 all-time
 highs
 right
 now."
 So,


it's
 like
 you
 you
 can't
 deny
 the
 fact


that
 margin
 has
 been
 used
 in
 a
 very


inappropriate
 way
 every
 time
 it
 gets
 to


these
 levels.
 However,
 those
 people


might
 end
 up
 being
 right.
 I
 told
 this


story
 before,
 but
 I
 knew
 a
 guy
 on


Twitter
 who
 took
 out
 margin
 to
 buy


pounder
 at
 50
 bucks.


At
 the
 time,
 look,
 we
 had
 just
 gone
 up


from
 freaking
 10
 to
 50
 in
 less
 than
 a


year.
 And
 I
 see
 him
 buying
 thousands
 of


shares
 at
 $50
 on
 margin.
 And
 he's


publicly
 talking
 about
 it.
 And
 in
 my


head,
 I'm
 like,
 dude,
 I
 love
 Pounder,


but
 like
 goodness,
 great.
 We
 just
 had
 a


5x.
 Like,
 now
 you're
 borrowing
 money
 to


buy
 a
 stock
 at
 50.
 Like
 the
 odds
 are,


what
 if
 we
 take
 a
 retracement
 because


it's
 up
 5x
 in
 eight
 months?


That
 guy
 was
 a
 genius
 because
 he


borrowed
 at
 5%
 to
 buy
 an
 asset
 that
 went


up
 300%.


I
 mean,
 there's
 there's
 no
 way
 about
 it.


He
 was
 right.
 Like,
 if
 if
 you're
 going


to
 borrow
 at
 5%
 or
 6%
 or
 7%
 and
 you're


going
 to
 buy
 something
 that's
 going
 to


triple


like
 you
 made
 a
 really
 good
 deal,
 dude.


I'm
 sorry.
 Like,
 you
 did
 a
 great
 job.


Like,
 you
 you
 you
 nailed
 it.
 And
 so,
 in


this
 bull
 market,
 I
 don't
 think
 he's


alone.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people.


There's
 probably
 some
 people
 in
 this


chat
 that
 have
 done
 something
 similar
 to


that
 that
 have
 taken
 out
 margin
 in
 end


of
 23,
 call
 it
 mid
 2024
 and
 absolutely


nailed
 it.
 Call
 it
 luck,
 call
 it


whatever
 you
 want,
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of the


day,
 Palinger
 put
 up
 the
 growth.
 And
 you


know,
 even
 I
 didn't
 expect
 it
 to
 get
 to


400
 billion
 this
 early,
 but
 the
 fact


that
 it
 got
 there
 was
 enough
 for
 him
 to


probably
 take
 some
 profits
 and
 then
 pay


back
 the
 margin
 and
 and
 keep
 the


difference.
 So,


you
 know,
 from
 that
 perspective,
 I
 I


think
 that's
 why
 margin
 has
 worked
 out


so
 well
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 years.
 We


saw
 IBKR's
 margin
 is
 up
 80%


year-over-year.
 Robin
 is
 Robin's


probably
 going to
 have
 record
 margin


loans
 as
 well.
 And
 margin
 is
 a
 juicy


juicy
 um
 sector
 of
 all
 these
 brokerages.


Schwab
 is
 giving
 out
 record
 margin.
 And


as
 long
 as
 the
 bull
 market
 continues,
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 a
 top
 signal
 because


it's
 the
 margin
 was
 a
 top
 signal
 every


other
 time
 when
 you
 had
 a
 cataclysmic


event
 2007
 housing
 crisis,
 2021
 interest


rates,
 2000
 tech
 bubble.
 The
 cataclysmic


event
 is
 what
 causes
 the
 bubble.
 Now


some
 people
 say
 causation
 is
 not


correlation
 and
 you
 know
 maybe
 the


margin
 is
 the
 the
 precursor
 before
 the


cataclysmic
 event.
 Maybe
 maybe


but
 if
 it's
 not
 because
 everyone's


screaming
 bubble
 which
 is
 actually


really
 good
 because
 it's
 creating
 this


wall
 of
 worry
 and
 the
 margin
 debt
 going


higher
 is
 not
 the
 signal
 to
 get
 the
 hell


out
 of
 the
 markets
 because
 there's
 some


cataclysmic
 crash
 coming
 then
 the
 game


continues
 and
 people
 will
 still
 be
 able


to
 leverage
 and
 their
 cost
 of
 borrowing


will
 go
 lower
 because
 the
 Fed's
 going to


be
 cutting
 rates.


And
 as
 the
 Fedi
 as
 as
 the
 Fed
 continues


to
 cut
 rates,
 you
 know,
 you're
 going
 to


continue
 to
 see
 uh
 more
 people
 not
 have


to
 pay
 as
 much.
 And
 if
 assets
 go
 up,


when
 the
 Fed
 cuts
 rates
 and
 the
 cost
 of


borrowing
 capital
 goes
 down,
 that's
 just


more
 money
 coming
 into
 these
 assets
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to


see
 how
 this
 plays
 out,
 but
 I
 think
 that


is
 uh
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 analysis
 right


there
 on
 the


on
 the
 on
 the
 margin
 debt
 situation.
 Um,


okay.
 I'm
 trying
 to
 get
 some
 more
 of


this
 footage.
 Oh,
 do
 I
 have
 this?


Trying
 to
 get
 some
 more
 of
 this
 footage


of
 this
 Air
 Force
 One
 stuff.
 Okay,
 let's


Is
 this
 it?
 Is
 this
 the
 right
 one?
 Let


me
 see.


We
 have
 a
 couple
 clips
 right
 here.


Yeah,
 this
 might
 be
 it.
 All right,
 so


we'll
 skip
 around
 here
 and
 we'll
 see
 if


we
 can
 get
 the
 China
 comments.
 Let's


pull
 this
 up.


>> I
 think
 really
 a
 very
 lot.
 Uh
 you


probably
 just
 saw
 the
 piece
 on
 Steve
 and


Jared.
 It's
 very
 good.


>> Yeah,
 because
 otherwise
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


make
 a
 deal.
 No,
 I
 want
 them
 to
 buy.
 We


have
 a
 20%


amount
 of
 money
 in
 tariffs
 like
 they've


never
 paid
 before.


>> Okay,
 this
 the
 China
 stuff.


>> You
 know,
 they
 paid
 a
 lot
 during
 my


first
 administration,
 my
 first
 term.
 Uh


now
 they're
 paying
 an
 unbelievable


amount
 of
 money
 to
 the
 United
 States.


They
 probably
 can't
 pay
 that
 much,
 and


I'm
 okay
 with
 that.
 We
 can
 lower
 that,


but
 they
 have
 to
 do
 things
 for
 us,
 too.


It's
 no
 longer
 a
 one-way
 street.
 Yeah.


>> What
 would
 you
 lower
 it
 to,
 do
 you


think?


>> Depends.
 I
 mean,
 we'll
 have
 to
 see
 what


they
 want.
 One
 of
 the
 penalties
 we
 have


in
 because
 they're
 sending
 in
 fentinol,


we
 have
 a
 20%,
 as
 you
 know,
 a
 20%
 tariff


on
 that,
 but
 they'd
 be
 paying
 about
 157%


tariff,
 which
 is,
 you
 know,
 record


setting
 type
 tariff.
 Uh,
 I
 don't
 want


them
 to
 do
 that.
 I
 want
 to
 help
 China.
 I


want
 to
 not
 looking
 to
 hurt
 China,
 but


they
 have
 to
 give
 us
 things,
 too.


>> China,
 Mr.
 President,
 on
 soybeans.
 Are


you
 confident
 that
 you'll
 be
 able
 to


>> have
 to
 buy
 soybeans?
 One
 of
 the
 things


I
 want
 is
 China's
 going
 to
 buy
 soybeans.


I
 want
 China
 to
 stop
 with
 the
 fentinol.


We
 very,
 you
 know,
 normal
 things.
 I


don't
 want
 them
 to
 play
 the
 rare
 earth


game
 with
 us.


>> But
 you
 want
 them
 to.
 But
 do
 you
 think


they
 will
 make
 a
 deal
 on
 soybeans?


>> I
 do
 believe.
 Yeah.
 Because
 otherwise


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 make
 a
 deal.
 No,
 I
 want


them
 to
 buy.
 Our
 farmers
 have
 been


boycotted
 by
 China
 as
 a
 negotiating


point.
 I
 don't
 want
 that.
 Our
 farmers


are
 great
 and
 in
 particular
 our
 soybean


farmers.
 And
 I
 want
 them
 to
 start
 buying


soybeans
 at
 least
 in
 the
 amount
 that


they
 were
 buying
 before.
 And
 I
 believe


they'll
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that.


>> Sticking
 with
 soybeans
 and
 on
 Argentina,


you're,
 you
 know,
 you're
 looking
 to
 that


deal
 with
 Argentina,
 the
 bail
 swap.
 So,


>> are
 we
 expecting
 beef?


>> Are
 we
 expecting
 a
 beef


>> with
 you?
 I
 assume
 you're
 talking
 about


beef.
 Yeah.
 To
 get
 beef
 prices
 down.
 The


only
 price
 we
 have
 that's
 high
 is
 beef.


And
 we'll
 get
 that
 down.
 And
 one
 of
 the


things
 we're
 thinking
 about
 doing
 is


beef
 from
 Argentina.
 But
 my
 question
 is,


what
 do
 you
 have
 to
 say
 to
 US
 farmers


who
 feel
 that
 the
 deal
 is
 benefiting


Argentina
 more
 than
 it
 is
 them
 as
 they


are


>> Argentina's
 fighting
 for
 its
 life?
 Young


lady,
 you
 don't
 know
 anything
 about
 it.


They're
 fighting
 for
 their
 life.


Nothing's
 benefiting
 Argentina.
 They're


fighting
 for
 their
 life.
 You
 understand


what
 that
 means?
 They
 have
 no
 money.


They
 have
 no
 anything.
 They're
 fighting


so
 hard
 to
 survive.
 If
 I
 can
 help
 them


survive
 in
 a
 free
 world,
 I
 happen
 to


like
 the
 president
 of
 Argentina.
 I
 think


he's
 trying
 to
 do
 the
 best
 he
 can,
 but


don't
 make
 it
 sound
 like
 they're
 doing


great.
 They
 are
 dying.
 All right.


They're
 dying.


>> What
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 a
 beef
 deal,
 sir?


>> Uh,
 we
 would
 buy
 some
 beef
 from


Argentina.
 Uh,
 if
 we
 do
 that,
 that
 will


bring
 our
 beef
 prices
 down
 because
 our


groceries
 are
 down.
 Our
 energy
 prices


are
 down.
 I
 think
 we're
 going to
 have
 $2


gasoline
 pretty
 soon.
 We're
 getting


close.
 And
 everything,


>> folks.
 Nikki
 is
 up
 almost
 3%.


I
 don't
 see
 the
 headline
 for
 why
 Japan's


moving
 like
 this,
 but
 Japan
 is
 moving.


There
 might
 be
 something
 going
 on.
 Maybe


it's
 these
 Trump
 soybean
 comments,
 but


uh
 it's
 a
 pretty
 big
 move
 on
 the
 NK


right
 now.


The
 one
 thing
 that's
 kept
 up
 is
 beef.


And
 if
 we
 buy
 some
 beef,
 not
 I'm
 not


talking
 about
 that
 much
 from
 Argentina,


that
 would
 help
 Argentina,
 which
 we


consider
 a
 very
 good
 country,
 a
 very


good
 ally
 in
 a
 place.
 Although
 I
 must


tell
 you,
 if
 you
 take
 a
 look
 now,
 South


America
 is
 turning.
 Those
 South
 American


countries
 are
 starting
 to
 turn
 very
 much


toward
 us.


>> They're
 getting
 away
 from
 socialism
 and


you
 can
 go
 right
 down
 the
 pack.
 But
 uh


they
 are
 they
 are
 starting
 to
 turn.
 It's


pretty
 amazing.


>> May
 I
 ask
 you
 about
 Israel
 again?
 Um


were
 do
 you
 feel
 that
 Israel
 was


justified
 with
 striking
 when
 it
 did?


>> Striking
 where?


>> In
 Gaza
 today
 and
 overnight.


>> I'd
 have
 to
 get
 back
 on
 that.
 I'd
 have


to
 get
 back.


>> What
 is
 the
 next
 step?


>> Because
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 determined.


You
 know,
 all
 of
 that.
 All
 right.
 So,


those
 are
 the
 comments.
 Uh,
 he
 doesn't


want
 to
 play
 the
 rare
 earth
 game
 with


China.
 He
 wants
 soybeans
 to
 be
 bought


and
 he
 wants
 a
 deal
 to
 be
 made.
 Uh,


especially
 in
 the
 context
 of


tariffs
 and


well,
 basically
 China
 finally
 buying
 a


lot
 of
 the
 product
 that
 would
 help
 US


farmers.
 And
 I
 think
 he's
 holding
 that


Nvidia
 chip
 as
 bargaining
 to
 only
 give


to
 them
 when
 they
 confirm
 they're


definitely
 going
 to
 buy
 our
 beef
 and
 not


have
 these
 export
 controls
 on
 rare
 earth


minerals.
 Uh
 not
 sure
 again
 why
 Japan
 is


pumping
 right
 here.
 I
 think
 it
 might


just
 be
 because
 the
 broader
 S&P
 is
 based


on
 Trump
 saying
 this.
 Wow,
 look
 at
 the


S&P
 6573.


S&P
 is
 really
 moving
 on
 this
 China


stuff.
 Tesla's
 up
 1%.
 Nvidia's
 up
 half
 a


percent.
 Palin
 is
 up.
 Hood
 is
 up.
 AMD,


look
 at
 that
 from
 230
 to
 237.
 That's


making
 moves.
 SoFi
 27
 not
 too
 bad
 and


then
 Google
 254.


I'm
 not
 sure
 I'm
 not
 sure
 what
 was
 going


on
 with
 the
 Nikk
 I
 don't
 see
 a
 single


Japan
 headline
 that's


really
 giving
 any
 analysis
 here.
 Last


week
 was
 the
 the
 election
 of
 the
 the


prime
 minister
 becoming
 official.


uh
 today
 it
 might
 be
 might
 be
 something


going
 on
 with
 the
 US
 potentially
 the


5-year
 Treasury
 in
 Japan
 is
 going
 up.


Maybe
 people
 are
 selling
 Japanese
 bonds


and
 buying
 stocks.
 That
 could
 be


happening.


But
 you
 do
 have
 the
 NK
 going
 great.


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 that
 could
 be
 the
 reason


people
 selling
 bonds
 and
 buying


equities.


All right,
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 with


Trump.
 That's
 what
 we
 got
 with
 soybeans.


And
 overall
 that's
 helping
 equities
 in


the
 overnight
 markets.
 We'll
 see
 what


happens
 tomorrow
 when
 the
 market
 opens


and
 we
 get
 a
 lot
 more
 traders
 coming
 in.


Now
 we
 are
 getting
 towards
 the
 end
 of


October
 and
 here's
 another
 survey
 by


Bank
 of
 America.
 Take
 a
 look
 at


institutional
 fund
 manager
 cash
 levels.


So
 this
 is
 not
 just
 retail
 that's
 buying


the
 dip.
 It
 is
 not
 just
 retail
 that's


plowing
 in
 money.
 It
 is
 at
 the
 lowest


level
 in
 history.
 3.8%.


3.8%.
 8%
 on
 cash.
 We
 the
 institutional


guys.
 Now
 the
 I
 think
 the
 reason
 for


this
 is
 what
 Tomley
 said
 yesterday
 or
 on


Friday,
 which
 is
 22%
 of
 fund
 managers


have
 yet
 to
 have
 only
 met
 their


benchmark.
 Aka
 there's
 uh
 78%
 of
 fund


managers


like
 that
 math.
 100
 minus
 22
 78.
 They


call
 me
 a
 quant.
 They
 call
 me
 a
 quant.


78%
 of
 fund
 managers
 have
 not
 met
 their


benchmark.
 So
 is
 that
 right?
 Hold
 on.


100
 minus
 Oh,
 thank
 god.
 Yes,
 I
 thought


it
 was.
 Okay,
 that's
 good.
 So
 78%
 of


fund
 managers
 have
 not
 met
 their
 bench.


They're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 chase.
 They're


going
 to
 probably
 have
 to
 chase,
 right?


And
 so
 3.8%
 cash
 levels,
 you
 would


imagine
 that
 3.8%
 when
 rates
 come
 down


probably
 gets
 down
 to,
 I
 don't
 know,
 3.2


3.3.
 Money
 market
 funds
 lost
 a
 little


bit
 of
 money
 last
 week.
 So
 you
 finally


got
 a
 week
 of
 uh
 outflows
 after
 five


weeks
 of
 inflows.
 Lost
 about
 17
 billion.


Still
 7.3
 trillion
 on
 the
 sidelines.


So
 you
 got
 the
 Fed
 easing,
 you've
 got


the
 AI
 capex
 tailwind,
 you've
 got


earnings
 growth,
 which
 is
 supposed
 to


be,
 you
 know,
 double
 digits,
 which
 would


be
 phenomenal.
 Like
 I
 cannot
 stress
 how


phenomenal
 it
 would
 be
 to
 have
 10%


earnings
 growth
 across
 the
 board.


Usually
 you
 get,
 you
 know,
 on
 average


seven
 to,
 you
 know,
 realistically
 five


to
 7%
 and
 in
 the
 bull
 market
 you
 get


eight
 to
 nine.
 We
 are
 in
 a
 real
 bull


cycle
 where
 you
 could
 get
 potentially
 10


to
 12,
 which
 would
 be
 incredible.
 Then


you
 got
 all
 this
 money
 on
 the
 sidelines


and
 then
 you
 have
 fund
 managers
 that
 are


ready
 to
 to
 probably
 buy
 the
 dip.


I
 don't
 know.
 It
 feels
 feels
 bullish.


Now,
 you
 also
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


flush
 out
 of
 all
 the
 stocks
 last
 week


that
 were
 going
 crazy
 and
 you
 have
 them


come
 back
 down
 to
 reality.
 Oaklo
 instead


of
 being
 uh
 193
 is
 at
 162.
 Now,
 people


might
 think
 162
 is
 still
 stupid,
 but


nonetheless,
 it's
 at least
 not
 at
 193.


And
 so,
 Robin
 Hood,
 as
 much
 as
 I
 love


Robin
 Hood,
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 really


deserve
 to
 go
 to
 150
 before
 they
 put
 up


earnings.
 And
 if
 they
 put
 up
 really
 good


earnings
 and
 Bitcoin
 does
 well,
 market


does
 well,
 I
 think
 Robin
 Hood
 should
 get


back
 to
 those
 levels
 to
 end
 out
 the


year.
 And
 it
 could
 be
 a
 really
 good
 bull


run.
 But
 did
 it
 deserve
 to
 go
 from
 120


to
 150
 in
 7
 days?
 Probably
 not.
 That
 was


a
 bit
 aggressive.
 Back
 down
 to
 132.
 A


lot
 more
 reasonable.


So,


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 we're
 we're


getting
 some
 more
 reasonable
 ways
 to
 be


thinking
 of
 this
 market,
 especially


after
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 And
 if
 we


take
 another
 draw
 down
 this
 week
 of
 1%,


it's
 not
 going to
 be
 the
 worst
 thing
 in


the
 world.
 But
 I
 think
 it
 will
 help
 set


up
 a
 really
 good
 earning
 cycle
 to
 beat


and
 then
 for
 a
 lot
 of these
 stocks
 to


potentially
 make
 new
 all-time
 highs
 if


um
 the
 broader
 market
 atmosphere
 is
 to


buy
 the
 dip
 on
 companies
 that
 are


putting
 up
 good
 earnings.


And
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 the
 worst
 thing


in
 the
 world.
 Now,
 having
 said
 that,


some
 quick
 thoughts
 on
 Palanteer
 right


here.
 Uh
 dude,
 I've
 been
 saying
 this
 for


the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 I
 think
 they
 can


make
 a
 run
 to
 200
 by
 end
 of
 year.
 I've


been
 like,
 so
 so
 we
 we
 are
 about
 a
 month


away,
 not
 even
 a
 month,
 like
 two
 weeks


away
 from
 pounder
 earnings.
 This
 is
 when


I
 start
 to
 really
 dig
 into
 pounders


numbers.
 Usually
 two
 weeks
 before
 the


earnings,
 I
 start
 to
 go
 deeper
 into
 the


numbers
 from
 last
 quarter
 and
 start
 to


make
 some
 predictions
 and
 think
 about


what's
 going
 to
 happen.
 I've
 been


studying
 it
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 days


now.
 I
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 put
 up
 51


to
 52%
 growth.
 Street's
 expecting
 around


48.
 And
 I
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 guide


from
 45%
 closer
 to
 49%
 for
 fiscal
 year


2026.


If
 that's
 the
 case,
 and
 what
 really


triggered
 me
 to
 really
 to
 start
 going


deeper
 on
 on
 what's
 going
 on
 with


Palenteer
 is
 is
 is
 this
 whole
 Salesforce


Dream
 Force
 con
 where,
 you
 know,
 Mark


Benov's
 like,
 we'll
 get
 a
 rule
 of
 50
 by


2030
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 60
 billion
 in


revenue.
 We're
 going to
 grow
 10%


year-over-year.
 I'm
 like,
 wait
 a
 second,


that's
 not
 an
 exciting
 story.
 It's
 just


not.


Salesforce
 is
 deeply
 undervalued.
 It


will
 be
 a
 higher
 market
 cap
 company
 in


2030
 than
 it
 is
 today.
 But
 10%
 growth


and
 a
 rule
 of
 50
 is
 not
 exciting.
 It's


just
 not.
 And
 then
 you
 had
 the
 headline


on
 Friday
 where
 Mark
 Beni
 off
 apologized


for
 saying
 that
 Trump
 should
 send
 the


National
 Guard
 to
 um
 to
 San
 Francisco


after
 two
 days
 ago
 saying
 that
 he


should.
 So
 yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 I
 thought
 it


was
 quite
 hilarious.
 You
 know,
 whatever


political
 side
 of
 the
 aisle
 you're
 on
 is


fine,
 but
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 couldn't
 keep


an
 opinion
 consistent
 for
 two
 days.
 I


mean,
 like,
 does
 the
 US
 government


really
 want
 to
 work
 with
 someone
 that


can't
 actually,
 you
 know,
 hold
 on
 to
 to


an
 opinion
 because
 they're
 so
 worried


about
 what
 people
 think?
 or
 do
 they
 want


to
 work
 with
 a
 company
 like
 Pounder
 that


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 is
 going
 to


support
 the
 government
 regardless
 of
 if


it's
 a
 Democrat
 or
 a
 Republican.
 I
 just


think
 US
 government
 growth
 for
 Palier,


US
 commercial
 growth
 and
 then
 if
 any


international
 commercial
 revenue
 we


start
 seeing
 an
 inflection
 in
 this
 is


the
 most
 exciting
 story
 in
 software.
 It


just
 is
 it
 is
 the
 most
 exciting
 story
 in


software.
 Now
 having
 said
 that
 the


caveat
 here
 is
 $200
 is
 a
 freaking
 what's


the
 market
 cap
 on
 that?
 How
 many
 shares


outstanding
 pound
 is
 2.5
 billion?
 So


that's
 what
 20
 more
 bucks.
 Yeah.
 Add
 50.


That
 that's
 what
 half
 a
 trillion


basically
 give
 or
 take
 10
 15
 billion.
 So


like
 does
 a
 company
 doing
 four
 and
 a


half
 five
 billion
 deserve
 to
 be
 worth


500?
 No.
 Probably
 not
 quantitatively.


However,
 I
 think
 the
 reason
 the
 stock


will
 still
 move
 quite
 frankly
 and
 I'm


thinking
 of
 buying
 another
 100
 shares


going
 into
 earnings
 is
 is
 this
 simple


idea.
 There's
 no
 other
 company
 that's


growing
 at
 the
 level
 the
 pounder
 is


growing
 at
 in
 AI
 which
 is
 the
 hottest


sector.
 There's
 no
 other
 company
 that


has
 the
 margins
 pounder
 has
 which
 I


think
 will
 increase
 the
 perception
 of


the
 the
 the
 runway
 for
 the
 trajectory
 of


growth.
 Right?
 If
 you
 can
 go
 out
 10


years
 and
 really
 model
 out
 the
 margins


inflecting,
 then
 it's
 not
 to
 say
 the


stock
 is
 cheap,
 but
 it's
 not
 like
 the


most
 overvalued
 company
 on
 the
 planet


right
 now.
 And
 then
 third,
 if
 there's


any
 level
 of
 growth
 internationally,


government
 or
 uh
 uh
 commercial,
 that


begins
 to
 compound
 with
 the
 US
 um
 uh
 um


essentially
 strength.
 I
 think
 the
 stock


goes
 higher,
 dude.
 I
 really
 do
 think
 the


stock
 goes
 higher
 and
 and
 then
 you
 we


just
 have
 to
 have
 a
 bull
 market
 end
 of


year.
 You
 know,
 we
 can't
 have
 S&P
 at
 650


and
 have
 pound
 at
 200.
 That's
 not
 going


to
 work
 out.
 But
 I
 kind
 of
 like
 that


pounder
 has
 been
 flat
 for
 basically
 two


months.
 I
 I
 like
 that
 the
 market
 is


taking
 a
 breather
 because
 that
 will
 set


up
 earnings
 to
 go
 really
 well.
 And
 I


just
 can't
 imagine
 when
 Paler
 puts
 up


50%
 growth,
 what
 is
 the
 street
 going
 to


say?
 We're
 bearish.
 Like
 like
 what
 is
 it


like,
 you
 know,
 the
 most
 the
 street
 can


say
 it's
 it's
 priced
 in
 already,
 the


stock's
 flat,
 which
 is
 like
 all right,


whatever.
 It's
 flat.
 Like
 okay,
 but


they're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 bearish
 on
 50%


grow.
 There's
 no
 way.
 There's
 no
 other


software
 company
 growing
 50%.
 Not
 at


this
 scale


with
 60%
 free
 cash
 flow
 margin.
 So
 it's


like
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 world
 where


Palter
 really
 delivers
 this
 quarter


again
 and
 this
 one
 plays
 out
 to
 200
 by


end
 of
 year.
 There's
 also
 a
 lot
 of


December
 call
 option
 volumes
 for
 that


190
 200
 strike.
 I
 mean


I
 think
 it's
 possible.
 So
 if
 you
 have


pounder
 look
 I
 wouldn't
 sell
 any
 covered


calls
 around
 200
 210.
 I
 would
 go
 even


further
 out
 unless
 you
 really
 think
 it's


just
 too
 aggressive
 for
 them
 to
 get


there
 that's
 fine.
 But
 I
 think
 there's
 a


world
 they
 pull
 it
 off.
 And
 it's
 in


November,
 which
 is
 good
 because
 we're


getting
 out
 of
 October
 and,
 you
 know,


maybe
 we're
 getting
 a
 lot
 more
 tech


earnings
 coming
 in
 to
 kind
 of
 help
 the


market
 digest
 all
 this
 momentum.


And
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 that
 would
 help.


Yes,
 App
 is
 doing
 70%
 revenue
 growth.


That
 is
 fair.
 And
 Apploven
 does
 have
 a


multiple
 on
 it.
 Now,
 the
 multiple
 has


been
 compressed
 because
 of
 this
 SEC


probe.
 Uh,
 but
 again,
 Apploven
 is


advertising.
 You
 know,
 it's
 not
 the
 most


exciting
 story.
 It's
 a
 cool
 story.
 It's


fun,
 but
 it's
 not
 the
 AI
 implementation


that
 is
 saving
 a
 hospital
 millions
 of


dollars
 every
 year,
 right?
 Like
 that's


just
 not
 the
 story.
 So,
 I
 I
 I
 just
 think


Paler
 is
 a
 real
 shot
 to
 put
 up
 a
 one
 of


those
 quarters
 and
 as
 a
 result


potentially
 for
 the
 market
 to


continue
 expanding
 and
 rewarding
 that


multiple.


So,
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 on


uh
 Palunteer.
 I
 think
 that's
 pretty
 much


all
 our
 headlines.
 Oh,
 this
 headline


right
 here.
 Apple's
 iPhone
 17
 spurs
 the


strongest
 sales
 growth
 since
 the


pandemic.
 Looks
 like
 Apple
 is
 Apple
 up


right
 now.
 I
 mean,
 it
 looks
 like
 iPhone


17,
 but
 let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat.
 Have


you
 bought
 an
 iPhone
 17
 or
 anything


else?
 Apple
 right
 here
 252.
 I
 bought
 an


iPhone
 16
 a
 couple
 weeks
 before
 the


iPhone
 17
 because
 I
 needed
 a
 new
 phone.


But,
 I
 mean,
 it
 does
 look
 like
 this
 is
 a


pseudo
 super
 cycle
 for
 people
 that
 have


been
 waiting
 to
 upgrade,
 which
 is


bullish
 Apple.
 And
 you
 know,
 if
 we


continue
 to
 see
 more
 excitement
 around


Apple,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 this
 stock's


closer
 to
 275
 end
 of
 year.
 This
 was
 the


chart
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 right
 here.


Zero
 Dday
 options,
 zero
 DTE
 remains
 at


historical
 highs.


This,
 I
 think,
 is
 more
 retail
 than
 not.


I
 mean,
 I'm
 sure
 there's
 institutional


investors
 that
 are
 like
 using
 zero
 DTE


to
 hedge.


Dude,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 retail
 investors


that
 love
 that.
 I
 have
 never
 done
 a
 zero


DTE
 ever.
 I've
 never
 understood
 taking


that
 type
 of
 a
 g.
 I
 mean,
 I
 understand


it
 logically,
 like
 if
 you're
 right,
 you


make
 like
 3,000%
 in
 a
 couple
 hours,
 but


most
 of the
 time
 you're
 going
 to
 be


wrong.
 But
 the
 the
 these
 options
 rake
 up


so
 much
 volume.
 So,
 this
 continues
 to


show
 how
 much
 excitement
 there
 is
 in
 the


in
 the
 broader
 market.
 By
 the
 way,
 today


is
 Sunday,
 October
 19th.
 For
 those
 that


don't
 know,
 some
 stock
 market
 history,


um,
 this
 was
 one
 of
 the
 worst
 days
 ever


in
 the
 stock
 market
 back
 in
 1987.


1987
 you
 had
 its
 worst
 day
 in
 history.


S&P
 500
 fell
 20%
 in
 a
 day.
 Dow
 Jones
 was


down
 22%
 in
 one
 day.
 It
 was
 Black


Monday,
 October
 19th,
 1987.


Uh
 I
 think
 the
 market
 took
 a
 couple


years
 to
 end
 up
 recovering.
 And
 you


know,
 there
 still
 isn't
 the
 the
 best


evidence
 of
 documentation
 of
 why.
 I


mean,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 theories
 here
 and


there,
 but
 it
 was
 just
 one
 of
 those
 days


where
 everything
 fell
 apart.
 And
 imagine


20%
 down
 in
 a
 day.
 That
 would,
 you
 know,


the
 closest
 we
 got
 to
 that
 and
 I
 see
 a


lot
 of you
 guys
 saying
 you
 did
 end
 up


buying
 the
 17.
 So
 there
 is
 a
 decent


amount
 of
 people
 that
 upgraded
 their


phone
 this
 cycle
 as
 well.
 The
 closest
 we


got
 to
 that
 was
 April,
 right?


April
 was
 uh


6,000
 to
 4,800.
 It
 didn't
 happen
 in
 a


day.
 It
 happened
 in
 I
 think
 three
 weeks


for
 the
 draw
 down
 to
 fully
 play
 out.


It
 was
 less
 than
 three.
 I
 think
 it
 was


two
 weeks.
 Well,
 Mar
 do
 you
 guys


remember
 March?
 March
 sucked.
 March
 was


not
 fun,
 but
 March
 wasn't
 like
 the


bottom
 fell
 out.
 April
 was
 the
 bottom


fell
 out
 and
 everyone
 was
 like,
 "Holy


crap,
 like
 this
 is
 just
 bad."
 And
 then,


you
 know,
 it
 ended
 up
 being
 a
 buy
 the


dip.
 But
 we
 have
 not
 had
 a
 20%
 draw
 down


on
 the
 S&P
 since
 1987
 in
 a
 day.
 Even


during
 COVID,
 it
 was
 not
 down
 20%
 in
 a


day.


So,
 we've
 come
 a
 long
 way
 since
 then.


But,


nonetheless,
 America
 has
 continued
 to


persevere.
 S&P
 500
 still
 green
 overnight


overnight
 futures.
 Yeah,
 look
 at
 that.


66589.
 It's
 the
 best
 it's
 been
 in
 the


overnight
 markets.
 We'll
 see
 if
 this


continues
 on
 the
 market
 open.
 Nvidia


right
 there
 almost
 184.
 Tessy
 444.
 Look


at
 Tesla
 getting
 a
 boost
 right
 there
 up


1.1.
 Palanteer
 almost
 180.
 And
 then


Hoodie


13267.


My
 parents
 mortgage
 rate
 at
 the
 time
 was


like
 14%.


Yeah,
 interest
 rates
 being
 that
 high


definitely
 didn't
 help
 back
 then.
 I
 was


actually
 actually
 listening
 to
 Draen


Miller.
 There's
 this
 interview
 from
 him


in
 2009.
 Um
 I'm
 sure
 some
 people
 here


have
 watched
 it,
 but
 I'm
 like
 halfway


through
 and
 and
 he,
 you
 know,
 there's


some
 good
 clips
 that
 I'm
 going
 to
 take


out
 and
 show
 everybody,
 but
 he's
 he
 was


talking
 about
 the
 psychology
 of
 managing


a
 lot
 of
 money
 and
 making
 big


directional
 bets.
 And
 you
 know,
 most


people
 know
 Ducken
 Miller
 for
 the
 story


that
 when
 he's
 bullish
 on
 something,
 he


doesn't
 just
 go
 100%
 in,
 he
 goes
 200%


in,
 right?
 Like
 you're
 talking
 about


margin.
 This
 guy
 has
 loaded
 the
 boat
 on


very
 specific
 directional
 trades,


particularly
 in
 the
 currency
 market,


which
 is,
 you
 know,
 not
 just
 being


bullish
 on
 a
 stock,
 but
 you're
 or


bearish
 on
 a
 stock,
 but
 you're
 like,
 you


know,
 navigating
 an
 entire
 country's


currency
 with
 with
 a
 with
 a
 position.


And
 he's
 been
 pretty
 successful.
 Now,


he's
 had
 some
 some
 big
 losers
 like
 in


Indonesia,


but
 he's
 had
 some
 big
 winners
 as
 well.


So,
 it
 is
 quite
 incredible
 to
 kind
 of


see
 how
 some
 of
 these
 people
 have


managed
 money
 over
 time.
 And
 a
 lot
 of


the
 the
 psychological
 traits
 are
 the


same
 with
 with
 people
 that
 are
 not


managing
 $10
 billion
 like
 me
 and
 you.
 I


it's
 all
 about
 emotion.
 It's
 all
 about


the
 stomach
 and
 it's
 all
 about
 cutting


your
 losses
 and
 and
 maybe
 having
 more


conviction
 than
 not.
 It's
 it's
 it's
 the


the
 size
 of
 the
 money
 is
 the
 difference,


but
 the
 actual
 philosophy
 really
 isn't


that
 different.


And
 so,


yeah,
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 every
 day
 as
 we


manage
 our
 own
 money,
 it's
 the
 same
 type


of
 philosophy
 and
 principles
 that
 we


have
 to
 navigate
 as
 well.


Robert
 says,
 "I'm
 managing
 20
 billion."


See,
 we
 got
 some
 people
 in
 the
 chat
 that


are,
 you
 know,
 big
 time
 right
 here.
 You


know,
 you
 know,
 it's
 funny
 that
 you
 met


you
 said
 you
 you're
 managing
 20
 billion


because
 Draen
 Miller
 doesn't
 even
 like


managing
 more
 than
 10
 billion.


And
 we
 he
 actually
 just
 got
 to
 to


this
 part
 of
 the
 interview.
 Let
 me
 see


if
 I'm
 there
 right
 there.
 But
 he
 he
 he


he
 doesn't
 like
 more
 than
 10
 billion


because
 he
 thinks
 that
 it's
 almost


impossible
 to


effectively
 manage.
 Yeah.
 Here's
 here's


the
 the
 clip
 right
 here.
 I'll
 put
 the


link
 for
 anyone
 who
 wants
 to
 watch
 this.


Let's
 go
 right
 here.


Believe
 something.
 I'd
 have
 no
 problem


putting
 100%
 of
 the
 fund
 in
 it.


again
 with
 the
 liquidity
 strength
 I
 me


constraint
 I
 mentioned
 earlier
 and
 I
 I
 I


will
 say
 that
 unlike
 my
 competitors
 and


who
 knows
 have
 the
 right
 model
 I
 learned


very
 very
 very
 early
 on
 cuz
 I
 think
 we


were
 the
 biggest
 at
 the
 time
 um
 at
 least


for
 me
 it's
 very
 difficult
 to
 run
 a


hedge
 fund
 with
 more
 than
 $10
 billion


effectively


and


you
 know
 being
 from
 the
 equity
 school


and
 having
 learned
 currencies
 and
 bonds,


I
 felt
 I
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 weapons.


So


the
 funds
 that
 to
 me
 over
 15
 or
 20


billion
 and
 still
 raising
 money,
 I
 don't


understand
 that.
 And
 we
 have
 tried


religiously


to
 keep
 our
 assets
 around
 the
 $10


billion
 level
 because
 my
 belief
 is


if
 we
 let
 our
 assets
 blow
 up
 to
 40
 or
 50


billion
 and
 immodestly
 we
 certainly


could
 have
 any
 time
 in
 the
 last
 3
 or


four
 years
 based
 on
 the
 record.
 I
 would


just
 have
 horrible
 performance
 and
 the


assets
 would
 leave
 anyway.
 So
 our


philosophy
 has
 been
 to
 grow
 it


organically
 and
 then
 when
 you
 get
 to
 10


billion
 start
 squeezing
 clients
 out
 and


manage
 our
 own
 money
 to
 try
 and
 keep
 it


there
 because
 in
 the
 long
 run
 a
 I've
 got


an
 ego
 problem.
 So
 I
 like
 I
 like


performing.
 Um
 after
 a
 while
 it's
 not


about
 the
 money
 you
 make,
 it's
 about


it's
 how
 you
 feel
 about
 yourself.
 Um


>> quite
 incredible,
 right?
 I
 I
 I
 recommend


people
 watch
 this
 if
 you're
 just


interested
 in
 the
 concept
 of
 how


professionals
 manage
 money
 because
 all


of
 us
 even
 if
 we're
 not
 professional


we're
 managing
 our
 money,
 right?
 And
 a


he
 says
 we
 could
 raise
 more
 money


because
 you
 know
 they've
 averaged
 25
 to


30%
 at
 his
 prime
 which
 was
 beating


pretty
 much
 every
 other
 hedge
 fund.
 So


they
 could
 have
 obviously
 raised
 you


know
 much
 more
 than
 10
 billion
 but
 drugs


like
 look
 that's
 too
 much
 pressure.
 I


don't
 know
 how
 to
 manage
 that
 much
 money


and
 B
 it's
 harder
 to
 perform
 and
 I
 have


an
 ego
 issue
 and
 I
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 I


can
 keep
 up
 my
 20
 30%
 every
 year
 which


means
 I
 have
 to
 be
 very
 selective
 with


the
 money
 that
 I
 manage


it
 it
 really
 is
 quite
 incredible
 but


these
 same
 principles
 they're
 you
 know


universal
 for
 most
 people
 when
 trying
 to


navigate
 the
 the
 process
 of
 managing


money
 whether
 it's
 100
 thousand
 or
 or
 a


billion.


So
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 from
 there
 and


that
 interview
 was
 from
 2009.
 So
 that


was
 right
 after
 the
 uh
 the
 collapse
 and


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 lot
 of
 good
 values
 or


at
 least
 good
 lessons.
 I
 think


>> that
 drugs
 talked
 about
 right
 there.


>> I'll
 make
 sure
 to
 keep
 my
 fund
 at
 10


billion.
 Yeah,
 I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 I
 can


make
 sure
 to
 keep
 my
 fund
 below
 10


billion.
 I
 I'm
 just
 like
 drugs.
 I
 don't


want
 to
 manage
 more
 than
 10
 billion


either.
 And
 I
 will
 make
 sure
 of
 it.
 I


will
 make
 sure
 that
 I
 uh
 I
 keep
 those


assets
 below
 10
 billion
 for
 now.
 Uh
 E


Penny,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Thanks


for
 your
 deep
 dive.
 Thank
 you
 for


checking
 out
 the
 Substack
 again.
 Deeply


deeply
 appreciate
 those
 that
 uh
 got
 into


it.
 I'm
 finding
 a
 new
 passion
 for


written
 word.
 You
 know
 what's
 so
 funny?


I
 was
 going
 to
 tell
 this
 to
 Steve


tomorrow.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 uh
 I
 think


we're
 done
 with
 the
 close.
 Steve
 is


about
 to
 do
 alternative
 assets
 weekly.


So
 for
 anyone
 who
 wants
 to
 listen
 to
 Mr.


Steven
 Fiorillo
 talk
 about
 Pokemon
 cards


and
 all
 those
 other
 alternative
 assets,


I'm
 putting
 the
 link
 right
 here.
 You


guys
 know
 the
 deal.
 CRN,
 you
 can
 spam
 it


in
 the
 chat.
 Last
 year,
 I
 was
 telling


Steve
 he
 should
 start
 YouTube.
 And
 he


was
 telling
 me
 I
 should
 start
 seeking


Alpha.
 It's
 so
 funny.
 He
 was
 like,
 "You


need
 to
 write
 articles."
 I'm
 like,


"Dude,
 I
 don't
 care
 about
 articles.
 I


don't
 enjoy
 the
 process
 of
 writing."
 And


I
 was
 like, "You
 need
 to
 start
 YouTube."


He's
 like,
 "Bro,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 sit
 in


front
 of
 a
 camera
 and
 talk.
 Like,
 you


know,
 I
 I
 have
 my
 process
 of
 content
 and


I
 and
 I
 and
 I
 write
 my
 articles."


And
 a
 year
 later,
 it
 switched.
 Like,
 now


he
 loves
 YouTube.
 This
 man
 was
 live
 till


like
 1:30
 last
 night.
 He
 freaking
 loves


live
 streaming.
 And
 I'm
 starting
 to


really
 enjoy
 the
 process
 of
 sitting
 down


for
 weeks
 doing
 research
 and
 then


turning
 that
 research
 into
 written
 word


that's
 consumable.
 And
 the
 best
 comment


I
 got
 on
 the
 deep
 dives
 is
 that
 a
 lot
 of


you
 said
 the
 way
 you
 read
 it
 was
 almost


the
 way
 I
 sound
 on
 the
 live
 streams.
 A


lot
 of
 you
 guys
 were
 like,
 you
 know,


it's
 fun
 because
 I'm
 reading
 this
 in
 the


way
 that
 I
 would
 be
 listening
 to
 you


speak
 on
 YouTube.


And
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 really
 appreciate
 that


because
 I
 tried
 to
 to
 keep
 some
 a
 level


of
 an
 authentic
 voice.
 And
 uh
 you
 know,


I
 threw
 some
 jokes
 in
 there
 as
 as


always.
 And
 the
 people
 that
 found
 those


Easter
 eggs
 found
 it.
 Shout
 out
 to


Samantha.
 If
 you
 know,
 you
 know.
 If
 you


know,
 you
 know.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 give
 it


away,
 but
 if
 you
 know,
 you
 know.
 If
 you


know
 about
 Samantha,
 you
 know
 about


Samantha.
 It's
 it's
 in
 the
 deep
 dives.


Specifically
 in
 the
 Dualingo
 one.
 If
 you


know,
 you
 know.
 But
 I
 want
 to
 I
 want
 to


keep
 that
 same
 authenticity.
 I
 want
 it


to
 really
 sound
 like
 it's
 me.
 And
 uh


yeah,
 we'll
 keep
 doing
 that
 going
 into


the
 future.
 So


there
 you
 mispronounce
 words
 and
 now


you're
 misspelling
 words.
 Exactly.
 Yes.


Exactly.
 I
 think
 there
 were
 definitely
 a


couple
 grammar
 errors
 there,
 but
 we'll


try
 to
 we'll
 try
 to
 work
 on
 that
 in
 the


future.
 All
 right,
 cool.
 So
 the
 summary


for
 the
 overnight
 markets
 are
 as


follows.
 Trump
 signaling
 really
 good


stuff
 with
 China
 in
 regards
 to
 not


getting
 into
 a
 massive
 tariff
 war.


That's
 bullish.
 The
 Nikkay
 likely
 up


because
 the
 US
 is
 up
 based
 on
 these


China
 comments.
 Jensen
 did
 a
 big


interview
 uh
 first
 wafer
 for
 the


blackwell
 chip
 was
 created
 in
 the
 United


States
 over
 the
 weekend
 was
 the


announcement.
 Markets
 really
 like
 that


that
 is
 official
 and
 American


manufacturing
 is
 coming
 back.
 And
 then


in
 terms
 of
 the
 macro
 stats,
 leverage
 is


high,
 margin
 debt
 is
 high,
 cash


allocation
 is
 low
 institutionally


and
 option
 volumes
 continue
 to
 go


higher.
 All
 of
 those
 things
 will
 either


be
 bullish
 or
 bearish
 based
 on
 earnings.


And
 this
 week
 we
 get
 Tesla
 and
 Netflix.


We
 had
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 companies,
 but


Tesla
 and
 Netflix
 are
 the
 most
 important


ones.
 And
 then
 the
 week
 after
 that
 is


really
 when
 we
 have
 our
 Super
 Bowl.
 And


if
 those
 companies
 can
 execute,
 then
 I


think
 this
 multiple
 for
 the
 S&P
 can


continue
 to
 sustain
 itself
 and
 expand


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 If
 the


earnings
 growth
 is
 really
 there,
 we
 just


have
 to
 see
 if
 that
 growth
 can
 be
 there.


Summary
 is
 risk
 on.
 That
 is
 correct.
 I


mean,
 we're
 cutting
 rates
 and
 earnings


are
 good.
 We're
 cutting
 rates
 and


earnings
 are
 good.
 Unless
 there's
 a


massive
 structural
 change
 like
 in
 the


credit
 markets,
 and
 you
 know,
 based
 on


the
 research
 I've
 done
 on
 regionals,
 it


doesn't
 seem
 like
 it's
 that
 big
 of
 a


deal.
 We'll
 see
 how
 it
 plays
 out
 over


the
 coming
 weeks,
 but
 rates
 are
 down,


earnings
 are
 up.
 That
 should
 be
 the


recipe
 to
 to
 get
 some
 momentum.
 All


right,
 thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 joining.


Uh,
 let's
 go
 to
 Steve's
 chat
 for
 those


that
 want
 to
 hear
 about
 some
 alternative


assets.
 CRN,
 we
 can
 spam
 it
 in
 the
 chat.


There
 he
 is,
 Mr.
 Alternative
 Asset


himself.
 He
 is
 live.
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys


there
 in
 the
 chat
 and
 we'll
 keep
 going


from
 there.
 Thank
 everybody.
 Appreciate


it.
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys
 tomorrow
 on
 the


market
 open.
 And
 once
 again,
 thank
 you


all
 for
 the
 support
 on
 the
 Substack.


Really
 means
 a
 lot.
 We
 we
 actually
 got


to
 number
 one
 in
 business
 on
 Substack.


Um
 and
 uh
 you
 know,
 we're
 above
 12,000


subscribers
 and
 we're
 we're
 number
 two


in
 bestsellers
 or
 something.
 So
 really,


really,
 really
 appreciate
 it.
 I'm
 going


to
 try
 to
 take
 it
 very
 very
 seriously.


There
 is
 no
 payw
 wall.
 So,
 for
 anyone


who
 wants
 to
 consume
 the
 content,
 it


will
 always
 be
 free
 and
 hopefully
 we
 can


continue
 to
 get
 better
 in
 written
 word.


Thank
 you
 everybody.
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys


on
 the
 market
 open.
 Bye-bye.
