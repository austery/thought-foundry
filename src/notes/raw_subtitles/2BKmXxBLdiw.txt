Hello everyone, I am Anthony
Welcome to my channel
In this video we continue to discuss trauma fascination
How to find a good relationship
Previous video
We explored several cases of trauma obsession
That is, a person
Chronically attracted to and hurt by toxic relationships
We have summarized several characteristics of trauma obsession
First of all,
In intimate relationships, the parties often
Repeated attempts to repair past trauma
They will try every possible way to change each other.
Invest more emotional resources
Hopefully "this time"
Can make up for the emotional experience that was not completed in the past
However
Such repair efforts are usually in vain.
Second is in trauma obsession
The parties involved often experience severe regression
For example, black and white thinking
and a primitive sense of atonement or guilt
think
Only through extreme self-sacrifice and endurance of suffering
To gain love or recognition
Of course, more importantly
Sometimes the parties involved can understand
This relationship is toxic
There are serious problems
But still feel a strong irresistible attraction
Keep getting involved
And this process
It seems difficult to express and understand with words
When someone asks
Why do you continue to maintain this bad relationship?
The parties may give a self-contradictory answer.
An inconclusive answer
Or use some abstract and empty words to avoid
Or they would say, you are right.
But I just can't do it
This kind of truth is understood
But it is impossible to do
It's actually quite common.
It also reminds us
Simply by reading and thinking about psychology
Why breakthroughs are often so difficult to achieve
Then this video
Let’s briefly discuss this topic.
If you are interested in today's video
or
Do you have any topic you want to discuss with me?
You can contact my email to make an appointment
So let's get back to our topic today.
First of all, when a person says that he "understands the truth
But I just can't do it"
What he said was "truth"
refers to the ability to be consciously extracted and reflected upon.
Content that can be verbalized and symbolized
What we usually call knowledge and memory
All belong to this category
For example, mathematical theorems, historical events,
Language and grammar rules, the meaning of words,
Scientific theories, etc.
They are all things that can be seen at the conscious level.
Use language to express and discuss
It can also be achieved through language and symbols
To constantly correct your understanding
Therefore, in these areas
if
We gain more accurate knowledge and memory
Automatically correct and modify the wrong knowledge
However, cognitive science tells us
Memory is not singular
It can be divided into explicit memory and implicit memory
Explicit memory is what we call memory in everyday life.
The main characteristics of implicit memory are
It is non-verbal and unconscious
is difficult to capture through direct linguistic reflection
Individuals just know how to do it.
But I don't know what and why
For example, how to dance, how to drive
How to ride a bike etc.
When you learn to ride a bike
Even though I haven't ridden a bike for many years
I will never forget
This is the skill acquired through implicit memory.
But this memory
Relies mainly on repeated behavior patterns
The familiar feeling created
Rather than conscious recall through language
So when you ride your bike
No need to concentrate on thinking about how to act
To automate tasks
If you try to think consciously
Cycling with language
Break down each action into specific steps
For example, I should turn left first
Turn the car to the left
Then adjust the center of gravity to maintain balance
This interferes with the instinctive action.
I can't ride a bike anymore
The most important implicit memory
The knowledge of how humans get along with others
That is, implicit relational knowing
This knowledge
When an individual establishes a close relationship with another
Gradually formed
Knowledge about how to interact with others
This knowledge does not exist in the form of language
Rather, it is through non-verbal, emotional and interactive means.
Subtly
Influencing our behavior and interaction patterns
For example, a 5-year-old child
An idea came to me by chance
He began to draw on paper.
His parents praised him
He is happy
afterwards
He may have completely forgotten that he was praised.
However, his exploration of spontaneity
Connect with the pleasant experience of being praised
and internalize it as a way of interacting with others
After growing up
He may be interested in his own spontaneous exploratory behavior.
The results are optimistic
Subconsciously tend to think that others will appreciate you
In fact, he often can't say it.
Evidence and basis for this optimistic outlook
Even if you receive some negative feedback
But he tends to believe subjectively
Your own exploration will have good results
While others
is
You must see very realistic rewards and feedback
Dare to explore some things
We can make an analogy like this
Implicit relational knowledge
Like a psychological account or bank
A person wants to do something spontaneous
He doesn't see clear feedback.
not necessarily
Gain support and recognition from most people around you
If he has more positive implicit relational knowledge
That is
When he thinks he will eventually gain the support of others
So
He can draw from this psychological bank
Advance part of capital
As start-up capital for your own business
He implicitly knew
You can get rewards in the future
Since this “knowing” is implicit
The parties involved may not be able to express themselves clearly and planfully.
So to outsiders it seems
This seems like irrational behavior.
But from his implicit relational knowledge
He is very rational.
And he might stick with it.
And achieved success
Others
You need to see very realistic and concrete returns.
To act
There is no way to predict and imagine
Things that can't see results for the time being
This means that it is more difficult to finance his mental account.
The result is
His actions are more conservative, cautious and traditional
Even if he knows rationally
People have to be bold to try in order to succeed
Don’t be too afraid of uncertainty and change
Then he read a lot of books
From many perspectives such as economics, sociology, psychology, etc.
How correct is this argument?
However, his personal behavior and style of doing things
But it can still be very conservative
Because of his reading and thinking
Just corrected the explicit memory
But it may not be able to correct his negative
Implicit relational knowledge
I believe everyone still remembers
In the video about statistical thinking
Also mentioned
When we rely solely on statistics
To guide your life
We may neglect our own
Those that cannot be quantified
Predicted and Statistical Features
These characteristics are related to our growth trajectory,
The key moments in life are closely related
Often, you don’t even realize it.
For example, the implicit relational knowledge we mentioned today
Although these implicit things cannot be counted
But it is extremely important
Even the decisive variable
This is the most unique part of every person.
It looks like something beyond reason.
But from his inner world and emotional experience
It's actually very reasonable
Therefore, we say
Implicit relational knowledge
Often shaped by non-verbal context
This requires us to pay attention to the experience beneath the language
and living environment
For example, if a child
I often see parents talking to each other tenderly.
Express intimacy
Then the child will feel
This kind of family atmosphere makes him relax.
Comfortable
He will feel that love and marriage are beautiful things
He may not realize
I learned how to get along with my parents
But in his future relationship with his partner
It will automatically replicate all of this.
And if a child
Having an emotionally withdrawn, cold father
and a mother who was often hysterical
He may not realize
Unhappiness in parents’ marriage
I won't talk to anyone.
Because he had a premonition since he was a child
This is a taboo topic
As a result, he will implicitly
Acquire a pessimistic expectation of intimacy
When there is conflict in a relationship
He tends to avoid communication
Through indifference, alienation
Even directly cutting off contact
If you ask him how he evaluates his original family
He might give an evasive answer.
For example, "It's OK"
“Almost” “Just like that”
But the languages ​​are not important.
Because he himself is a kind of deep defense
He tends to hide his feelings.
Worried about revealing true feelings
It will bring pain
then
He may put on a mask of rationality.
To cover up one's avoidance
for example
He believes that a person has an emotional need for others
It is a manifestation of dependence
Human independence is the most important
He may also draw on a lot of psychological concepts
for example
Describing one's avoidance as having a sense of boundaries,
Clearly defined performance
These words of the parties involved
Seems quite rational.
Emotionless
However, behind these words
Hidden is a deep fear,
Feelings of uneasiness and confusion
I have met some friends like this
They have some interpersonal trauma.
Feeling pain
So they started
Read a lot about psychology and relationship theory
Continuous self-analysis
Their level of knowledge and depth of self-analysis
They're all quite profound.
然而这一切却并没有显著地改善
Their status
Still avoiding and afraid to enter into a relationship
Because reading, thinking and self-analysis itself
It is difficult to rewrite and access implicit memory
The real key
New relationships and new experiences
We should understand
In terms of the goal of repairing trauma
Theoretical Analysis of Trauma
There is never a substitute for a real and healthy relationship
As one psychotherapist put it:
Patients want experiences, not explanations
In other words, patients need a relationship
Better than needing a reason to explain why
So how do we use interpersonal relationships?
To rewrite our implicit relational knowledge?
Psychologist Lyons-Ruth said in this article:
Traditional psychoanalysis emphasizes the importance of interpretation
That is, by explaining
Make repressed impulses and fantasies conscious
However, explanations alone are not enough to bring about change.
The author believes
In psychotherapy
What really matters are those special moments
That is the moment when the two parties establish a deep link
at this time
The therapist is no longer a
Simply on the patient's subconscious impulse
Theoretical experts who interpret and analyze
Not a blank slate or mirror
But also into their own real existence
Invest your emotions
and interact emotionally with patients
The author calls it an intersubjective meeting
That is, inter-subjective communication
This kind of emotional interaction and resonance
Often more than language can touch a person's self-identity
Integrate and rewrite the other party's rigid,
Unhealthy implicit relationship knowledge
This is not limited to psychotherapy.
It can be extended to all interpersonal relationships.
That is, truly beneficial interpersonal relationships
All are built on
In which both parties can feel each other
Acknowledge each other's emotions
And through interaction
Achieving emotional coordination and connection based on
Any relationship that promotes emotional resonance and coordination
It can be beneficial to our physical and mental health.
Brings great benefits
For example, it reduces the secretion of stress hormones such as cortisol
Enhance individual psychological resilience, etc.
In this process of emotional coordination
Language and symbolic expression
Not the only way
Although language is important
But emotional connection
It is also highly dependent on non-verbal interaction
Such as eye contact, body touching, kissing, etc.
These non-symbolic interactions are often more profound
Even if you speak
Emotional states beneath language
It is also worth paying attention to the content of the language.
For example, some people think
Good intimate relationship
It's just two people discussing serious and profound knowledge every day
Mutual Analysis
Side game
However, I think
Good intimate relationship
Both sides should be able to talk a lot of nonsense
So-called nonsense
Those without much meaning
Information with low timeliness
These seem insignificant.
Even boring conversations
It just enables us to communicate
No need to overthink the meaning of every sentence
Not due to excessive self-censorship
The emotional burden
It can also create a large number of
Instant emotional feedback and interaction
For example, passing by a restaurant
Let's complain about this store's ugly decoration.
Another example is seeing a particularly large dog on the street.
Happy to pull each other to watch together
Sharing trivial, meaningless emotions like this
It's easier
Create a communication space where people can express their feelings freely
In an intimate relationship
The atmosphere of this conversation
It is more healing than the content of the conversation.
Overall
Chat with the people you like.
Sleeping together
Many psychological problems will get better.
This is the best way to stay healthy
