I
 quit
 my
 job
 and
 then
 it
 took
 a
 year


and
 a
 half
 for
 me
 to
 launch
 Julius
 after


that.
 When
 I
 when
 I
 went
 all
 in,
 I
 was


nervous
 to
 be
 honest.
 I
 was
 scared,
 but


it's
 being
 a
 little
 scared
 is
 good.
 I


think
 fear
 is
 good.
 You
 It
 keeps
 you


sharp.
 It
 keeps
 you
 on
 your
 toes.
 You're


able
 to
 see
 through
 things.
 When
 you're


in
 a
 comfortable
 place,
 it
 it
 breeds


complacency
 and
 you're
 often,
 you
 know,


fooling
 yourself
 into
 believing
 that


your
 ideas
 are
 going
 to
 work
 one
 day.


But
 then
 when
 all
 the
 bridges
 are
 burned


and
 you
 really
 have
 to
 make
 a
 thing


work,
 you
 start
 thinking,
 you
 start


taking
 risks,
 taking
 shots
 at
 goal.
 But


having
 no
 other
 boats,
 you
 know,
 no
 life


boats,
 it
 it
 was
 a
 little
 scary,
 but
 I


think
 it
 was
 good.


I'm
 Rahul,
 founder
 and
 CEO
 of
 Julius
 AI.


Julius
 is
 an
 AI
 data
 analyst.
 If
 you


have
 data
 on
 your
 hands,
 Julius
 will


help
 you
 get
 insights
 from
 your
 data


within
 seconds
 and
 help
 you
 make
 charts


and
 data
 visualizations.
 Since
 launching


in
 2023,
 our
 users
 have
 used
 Julius
 to


make
 over
 10
 million
 data


visualizations.
 Every
 day,
 Julius
 writes


over
 4
 million
 lines
 of
 analysis
 code.
 4


million
 lines
 of
 code
 is
 more
 than
 an


army
 of
 data
 scientists
 can
 write
 every


day.
 It
 took
 about
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 to


get
 to
 2
 million
 users.


For
 AI
 startups,
 I'll
 say
 focus.
 Don't


build
 a
 general
 purpose
 tool.
 Startups


win
 because
 of
 focus.
 That's
 the
 only


advantage
 you
 have
 as
 a
 startup.
 Now,


Chad
 GBD
 is
 like
 all-in-one
 tool.
 Making


videos,
 making
 images,
 doing
 internet


search,
 writing
 essays,
 and
 it's
 just


allin-one
 tool.
 And
 it's
 not
 focused
 on


data
 analysis.
 So,
 the
 experience
 is


much
 worse.
 A
 lot
 of
 our
 users
 they


start
 with
 using
 Chad
 GPT
 and
 they


realize
 that
 to
 analyze
 any
 kind
 of
 real


data
 to
 get
 any
 kind
 of
 meaningful


insights
 Chad
 GPD
 falls
 short.
 The


quality
 of
 insights
 you
 get
 aren't
 that


deep.
 It
 cannot
 handle
 any
 kind
 of
 real


data.
 The
 charts
 don't
 look
 good.
 You


can't
 collaborate
 with
 your
 colleagues


on
 the
 analysis.
 So
 all
 these
 problems


people
 run
 into
 after
 using
 it
 for
 a
 day


for
 analysis
 and
 they
 all
 go
 to
 Google


and
 they
 look
 up
 AI
 data
 analysis
 and


the
 number
 one
 search
 result
 on
 Google


for
 that
 is
 Julius.


It's
 kind
 of
 like
 think
 about
 hiring


humans.
 Would
 you
 want
 to
 hire
 one
 human


that
 can
 do
 everything?
 You
 you
 can
 and


that
 will
 help
 you
 get
 decent
 results.


But
 then
 there's
 comes
 a
 point
 where
 you


want
 someone
 with
 deep
 expertise,


someone
 who's
 really
 really
 good
 at
 one


function
 like
 a
 marketer,
 finance
 prof,


finance
 person,
 an
 engineer.
 I
 think


focus
 agents
 for
 a
 task
 have
 much
 more


competitive
 advantage
 than
 like
 the


general
 purpose
 agent.


You
 know,
 there's
 this
 like
 conventional


meme
 like
 Google
 just
 killed
 your


startup,
 OpenAI
 just
 killed
 your


startup,
 XYZ
 just
 killed
 this
 all


startup.
 I
 think
 all
 that
 is
 very


overblown.
 As
 long
 as
 your
 users
 don't


care
 about
 that
 stuff,
 it
 shouldn't


matter.
 If
 you're
 building
 something


that
 solves
 a
 problem
 for
 people,
 if


you're
 doing
 that
 good
 job
 at
 that


better
 than
 everyone
 else,
 that
 all


that's
 all
 that
 matters.
 So,
 this
 is


back
 in
 college
 when
 I
 got
 into
 the


hackathon
 scene.
 I
 would
 go
 to
 these


hackathons.
 The
 big
 problem
 I
 noticed
 is


you
 have
 48
 hours
 to
 build
 and
 launch


idea.
 A
 lot
 of
 the
 time
 people
 would


spend
 on
 setting
 up
 a
 backend
 service,


setting
 up
 their
 database
 and
 I
 thought


that
 was
 a
 waste
 of
 time.
 So
 water


review
 was
 this,
 you
 know,
 managed


service.
 You
 would
 get
 out
 of
 box
 like
 a


backend
 server
 or
 database
 that
 just


kind
 of
 worked.
 It
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 users


and
 I
 would
 go
 to
 these
 hackathons,
 give


it
 to
 people
 and
 they
 would
 try
 it.
 It


would
 save
 them
 time.
 But
 problem
 was


none
 of
 the
 people
 that
 built
 their


hackathon
 projects,
 their
 weekend


projects
 on
 waterview
 continued
 to
 work


on
 those
 projects
 after
 that
 weekend.


You
 know,
 it
 was
 like
 a
 weekend
 thing.


The
 big
 lesson
 there
 was
 you
 can
 solve


the
 right
 problem.
 You
 can
 solve
 a


painoint
 for
 people,
 but
 if
 they
 don't


have
 that
 pain
 point
 daily
 or
 weekly,


they're
 not
 going
 to
 retain.
 They're
 not


going
 to
 come
 back
 to
 the
 product.
 You


you
 have
 to
 solve
 a
 problem
 people
 have.


If
 they
 have
 it
 only
 once
 a
 year
 or
 once


every
 6
 months
 or
 once
 a
 month,
 they're


not
 going
 to
 retain
 to
 your
 product.


That's
 the
 reason
 why water
 we
 failed.


And
 that
 was
 a
 very
 valuable
 lesson.


I
 worked
 as
 an
 engineer
 at
 Uber
 and


Facebook.
 When
 you're
 at
 a
 big
 company


and
 you
 have
 an
 idea,
 one
 no
 can
 kill


that
 idea.
 Get
 a
 yes
 from
 your
 manager.


You
 have
 to
 get
 a
 yes
 from
 your


manager's
 manager,
 design
 manager,


product
 manager.
 You
 have
 to
 get
 all


these
 yeses
 and
 even
 one
 no
 can
 kill


your
 idea.
 So
 innovation
 doesn't
 really


happen
 in
 big
 companies.
 And
 then
 at
 a


startup
 it's
 complete
 opposite.
 All
 you


need
 is
 one
 yes.
 Looking
 for
 customers


you
 know
 you
 can
 get
 50
 nos
 but
 one
 yes


your
 first
 customer
 that's
 all
 that


matters.
 Instead
 of
 one
 no
 killing
 your


idea.
 One
 yes
 can
 really
 make
 your


company
 work.
 So,
 one
 of
 the
 problems
 I


was
 trying
 to
 solve
 at
 Uber
 is
 people


book
 Uber
 rides
 usually
 for
 things
 that


they
 can't
 drive
 to,
 like
 uh
 like
 an


airport
 or
 from
 an
 airport
 or
 when


they're
 out
 going
 out
 at
 night
 to
 bars


or
 restaurants.
 That
 sporadic
 usage
 is


not
 good
 for
 Uber.
 One
 of the
 things
 I


wanted
 to
 solve
 for
 is
 how
 could
 we
 get


people
 to
 use
 Uber
 on
 a
 daily
 and
 weekly


basis?
 So,
 I
 wanted
 to
 launch
 this


commuter
 product
 at
 Uber.
 How
 can
 we


help
 people
 use
 you
 know
 Uber's


offerings
 Uber
 transit
 Uber
 X
 Uber
 um


Uber
 mobility
 like
 bikes
 as
 scooters
 all


that
 as
 a
 part
 of
 a
 commuter
 package


that
 companies
 could
 offer
 their


employees.
 So
 I
 wanted
 to
 pitch
 the


idea.
 I
 was
 pushing
 it
 really
 really


hard
 and
 you
 know
 I
 got
 buy
 in
 from
 a


lot
 of
 cross
 functional
 management.
 I


couldn't
 get
 behind
 from
 our
 um


engineering
 leader
 and
 I
 couldn't
 get
 in


from
 the
 engineering
 leader
 and
 that


crush
 idea
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I
 was


building
 apps
 and
 different
 ideas
 on
 the


side
 on
 the
 weekends
 and
 that
 motivated


me
 to
 just
 like
 quit
 my
 job
 and
 spend
 a


year
 exploring
 my
 ideas
 full-time.


Every
 failure
 is
 is
 is
 good.
 Failing
 is


good
 because
 you
 know
 what's
 what's
 not


working.
 I
 I
 I
 talk
 to
 founders
 and
 they


they're
 too
 scared
 to
 launch,
 too
 scared


to
 tell
 people
 what
 their
 idea
 is.


They're
 too
 scared
 to
 put
 the
 product


out
 there.
 I'm
 the
 opposite.
 You
 know,


at
 Julius,
 we
 launch
 things
 when
 they're


barely
 working
 because
 you
 want
 to
 get


early
 feedback
 from
 our
 users,
 our


customers.
 We
 want
 them
 to
 try
 it
 out.


We
 want
 to
 learn
 from
 our
 users
 and


customers
 on
 what
 they
 actually
 want
 and


how
 the
 things
 should
 work.
 So,
 I'll


give
 you
 one
 of
 the
 examples.
 We
 were


building
 in
 you
 know
 data
 and
 AI
 and


insights
 and
 we
 thought
 you
 know
 one
 of


the
 one
 of
 the
 group
 of
 people
 that
 want


insights
 from
 data
 but
 don't
 have
 the


expertise
 to
 go
 do
 data
 science
 on
 their


own
 is
 is
 sports
 fans.
 We
 built
 this


thing
 called
 NBA
 GPD
 was
 called
 hoops


GPD
 could
 help
 you
 query
 NBA
 data


playby-play
 data
 but just
 asking
 simple


questions.
 We
 had
 to
 build
 the
 UI,
 the


interface,
 figure
 out
 how
 this
 text
 to


querying
 engine
 is
 going
 to
 work
 and


ship
 the
 whole
 thing
 in
 like
 two
 weeks


because
 if
 you
 were
 too
 late,
 the
 NBA


season
 would
 be
 over.
 It
 was
 no
 point
 to


wait
 a
 year
 to
 try
 the
 idea
 again.
 And


turns
 out
 like
 sports
 fans
 aren't
 that


savvy
 about
 data.
 Turns
 out
 it's
 only


the
 people
 that
 want
 to
 do
 betting.
 Yep.


Really
 aren't
 the
 users
 you
 want
 to


serve.
 So
 we
 learn
 very
 quickly
 know


whether
 it's
 something
 people
 want
 or


don't
 want.
 We
 don't
 want
 to
 build


something
 that
 no
 one
 will
 ever
 want
 to


use.
 I
 think
 failing
 is
 important.


Failing
 fast
 is
 really
 really
 important.


Paul
 Graham
 talks
 about
 this
 in
 his


essays
 all
 the
 time.
 It's
 like
 failing


fast
 is
 super
 important.


This
 is
 months
 after
 launching
 Julius.


We
 had
 about
 10
 15,000
 users
 and
 most
 of


our
 users
 at
 that
 point
 were
 actually


coming
 from
 Chad
 GPT.
 Chad
 GP
 is
 this


plug-in
 store
 where
 users
 would
 discover


Julius
 and
 they
 would
 come
 to
 Julius,


stay
 with
 Julius
 and
 use
 Julius
 over
 and


over
 and
 it's
 going
 great
 and
 it's
 going


great.
 We're
 growing
 overnight.
 Open


announces
 that
 the
 plug-in
 store
 is


going to
 get
 shut
 down
 and
 our
 biggest


source
 of
 users
 disappeared
 overnight.


So
 we
 had
 to
 scramble
 and
 figure
 out
 how


we're
 going
 to
 get
 more
 users
 and
 where


we're
 going
 to
 get
 users
 from.
 So
 that


was
 an
 existential
 moment
 and
 that
 is


what
 really
 got
 us
 to
 move
 fast
 and


figure
 out
 okay
 how
 do
 we
 get
 our
 users


to
 become
 champions
 of
 Julius.
 Then
 we


realized
 that
 when
 people
 analyze
 data


they
 want
 to
 tell
 their
 colleagues
 about


it.
 When
 you
 get
 an
 insight
 you
 don't


keep
 it
 to
 yourself.
 You
 want
 to
 tell


your
 colleagues
 you
 want
 to
 tell
 your


team.
 And
 so
 we
 build
 sharing
 into
 the


product.
 If
 you
 solve
 a
 problem
 that


people
 have,
 they
 will
 come
 to
 you.


They'll
 come
 to
 you
 and
 they
 will
 use


your
 product
 and
 they'll
 tell
 their


friends
 about
 it.
 So
 word
 of
 mouth
 is
 a


free
 way
 to
 grow
 your
 product.


If
 I
 were
 to
 start
 from
 scratch
 today,


what
 would
 I
 do
 differently?


Nothing.
 I
 think
 you
 know
 all
 the
 things


I
 would
 consider
 as
 like
 missteps
 things


um
 I
 could
 have
 avoided
 I
 think
 those


are
 valuable
 lessons
 you
 know
 all
 the


features
 we
 tried
 and
 didn't
 work
 out


all
 that
 is
 really
 valuable
 lesson


that's
 helpful
 data
 you
 can
 if
 you
 have


only
 data
 from
 successes
 then
 that's


very
 skewed
 you
 know
 what
 doesn't
 work


so
 it's
 really
 important
 to
 try
 a
 lot
 of


things
 things
 that
 don't
 work
 also


important
 because
 now
 you
 know
 what


doesn't
 work
 honestly
 like
 I
 would
 not


do
 anything
 differently.
