- [Derek] This is the
first in a series of videos
about a chemical reaction
discovered over 125 years ago.
It releases a tremendous amount of heat.
Oh no, the GoPro.
Liquefying metal.
It is so hot.
It is not an explosive,
but it can cause explosions.
That is crazy!
But the reactants are so inert,
they can withstand a
blow torch indefinitely.
Do you think this whole thing's
going to blow up in my face?
In fact, when Hollywood directors
wanted something that
looked like a nuclear bomb,
this is the reaction they chose.
But in its most common use,
one basically unchanged in over a century,
it has helped move billions
of people all over the world.
In the late 1800s, Karl
and his younger brother,
Hans Goldschmidt,
were preparing to join
the family business.
Their father owned a chemical factory
making dyes for fabrics.
So they studied chemistry
under Robert Bunsen
of Bunsen burner fame.
After their father's early death,
Karl took over management of the company,
later joined by his younger brother.
One of Hans' first major research aims
was to find a way to produce pure metals.
These were essential for
making dyes for everything
from clothing and
tablecloths to wallpaper.
At that time, good dyes
were hard to come by.
Most were faint and
faded further after use.
Some required the collection
of large quantities of exotic insects.
These days, we take color for granted,
but in this drab world,
people would pay handsomely
for bright color fast dyes.
One such dye was Scheele's green,
which was chemically copper arsenite.
As its name suggests, it was toxic,
though exactly how toxic
is a matter of debate.
Still, it became the
dominant green dye by the end
of the 19th century because
its color was unbeatable.
The red color of the
British Army officer's coats
was made from cochineal,
a central American insect mixed with tin.
The addition of tin made the
color darker and more intense.
So the demand for pure metals was strong.
- They had their experience
in purifying metals
by dissolving them in
solutions or in acids
and all kinds of things.
- [Reporter] The incoming cyanide solution
goes on dissolving the particles
of gold left in the sand
after amalgamation and liquefies it.
- And then work with the
salts, purify the salts,
and then reduce the salts
into the metal state.
And every step that you
would take would then
again cause problems, right?
Reducing it in a furnace,
you have to deal with all the exhaust
and the contamination through the carbon.
- [Derek] And metals are very difficult
to separate from each other.
- They basically, they form
a mixed crystal, right?
- Like an alloy.
- Like an alloy, right.
They all become, in a sense,
one substance that has one melting point,
which is why you have to
kind of take some steps
to separate them.
- [Derek] So Hans came
up with a novel idea.
He would react a metal
oxide like chromium oxide
with aluminum metal,
and his hope was that the
oxygen would swap partners,
forming aluminum oxide and pure chromium.
This type of reaction is now
known as an aluminothermic
or thermite reaction.
So I have come to visit
Electro-Thermit in Germany,
a company that is a direct
descendant of Goldschmidts.
I feel like they've
set this up like a tour
of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory,
but instead it's a thermite factory.
Here we are going to try to replicate
Han's first successful reaction.
All experiments in this
video were performed
under the supervision of professionals
taking proper safety precautions.
- Originally, the first
experiment was using chrome,
but we are using copper,
which is comparable.
- [Derek] This is like 300 grams.
- [Axel] Yeah, 300 grams of thermite.
- Pour it in? All right.
We pour it into the crucible and ignite.
All right.
- Yeah.
- That's it.
- Yeah.
(shouts)
- Leave it, leave it, leave it.
- Whoa!
(laughs)
That is like fireworks.
Well, that's impressive.
- [Axel] But you bet he was
surprised when he saw that.
(both laughing)
Handful of aluminum powder,
and then you get this.
- [Derek] As you can see,
the reaction releases a lot of energy.
The temperature of thermite
reactions typically exceeds
2,000 degrees Celsius, and
it can be as much as 2,500.
That's because aluminum forms
very strong bonds with oxygen.
When those bonds form, they
release a lot of energy,
way more than is required to
break the copper oxide bonds
we started with.
This energy melts all the
products of the reaction
and makes them glowing hot.
It is hard to express
just how bright they are.
It feels like staring at the sun.
If you see clips in this video
where the highlights are overexposed,
it's because it is so hard to judge
how bright the reaction will be,
and it's almost always
brighter than you expect.
So that dropping down the bottom there,
is that liquid copper?
- [Axel] That's liquid copper
and basically the solution
that was being created.
- [Derek] But if you get this hot mixture
of pure metal and aluminum oxide,
how do you separate the two materials
to isolate the pure metal?
We're trying to set up an experiment
that no one has ever seen before
and it's actually going to allow us
to see inside the crucible.
We cut the crucible in half
and we're attaching two pieces
of thermally resistant glass,
each four millimeters thick,
as a window into the reaction.
People said this would be impossible,
that you wouldn't be able to see anything
or that the glass would just break.
- We've never done this on
camera and really seen it
this way, this clear.
And I think it's going to be fascinating
to then start to analyze
and make sense of this.
- Now this glass has
been specially treated,
so it shouldn't shatter immediately
when it comes into
contact with molten metal.
Ah, that is hot. That is really hot.
But the melting temperature of silica
is around 1,700 degrees Celsius,
which is definitely lower
than the temperature of the reaction,
so the glass certainly will melt.
The hope is it melts slowly
enough to contain the reaction.
- The glass will melt and at the end,
we have just a very thin
layer of the glass at the end.
So you will ignite it. It's up
to you to place the igniter.
- I think someone else should ignite it.
I think someone else should ignite it.
- [Christof] Why?
- Because I don't trust myself.
We saw how incapable I
was of igniting yesterday.
That's it? (shouts)
- Leave it, leave it, leave it.
- [Derek] For this reaction,
we'll be using iron thermite,
so a combination of iron
oxide and aluminum metal.
Okay, that's good. Let's do this.
Holy.
Oh no, the GoPro.
Oh boy.
Oh no.
Oh no.
That's the end of the GoPro.
The reaction starts at the igniter
and expands outwards in all directions.
To me, it almost looks like
ants or mold or something.
It looks organic in how
it's sort of spreading.
You see a pulse. Boom, boom, boom.
- [Christof] It's living.
- Yeah, that's what it looks like.
Why is there pulsing?
- I don't know.
- Okay.
- We try to understand.
- Huh.
- We never knew that it did that.
We do this for 100 years and
and suddenly you find out,
you know, every portion
that gets ignited does that.
- Do you think that's gas escaping up
and that's almost what causes the pulsing?
Like some gas heats up
and then it shoots up
and then it makes space for the next one?
That's what you seem to see over here.
- [Christof] Yeah.
- Wow, that is hot. That is really hot.
I wanted to get a closer look,
so I asked them to put some
thermite on top of glass,
and then I would shoot from
below using this probe lens.
- I'm ready.
- Okay, we're rolling.
It's rolling, it's rolling, it's rolling,
it's rolling, it's rolling.
There it goes, there
it goes, there it goes,
there it goes, there
it goes, there it goes.
Wow! Yeah!
The exposure's pretty good.
Oh my goodness. Incredible.
This is the closest I think anyone's
ever filmed a thermite reaction.
You can see that the
reaction proceeds in bursts,
it reacts fast, but
then pauses for a moment
before advancing again.
- Should I take it?
- Sure.
Yeah, take it, take it,
take it, take it, take it,
take it, take it, take it,
take it, take it, take it.
Oh boy.
I have two ideas about why this might be.
First, there might is a mixture of grains,
big particles of aluminum and iron oxide,
and they need to be
present in the right ratio
to react efficiently.
Maybe a little pocket reacts
out to where the ratio
is slightly less ideal
until the heat builds up
enough to trigger the
reaction in the next pocket.
My second idea is that in
between the grains, there is air.
The reaction heats the air, which expands,
increasing the pressure between the grains
and possibly pushing some
of the unreactive material
away from the reaction front.
So once that air escapes,
the next patch can ignite.
Once all the thermite has reacted,
things get really violent.
Molten metal is ejected out
of the top of the crucible,
and inside, the liquid is sloshing around.
This could be due to some
of the materials boiling,
actually turning from liquid into a gas.
Now, I know it sounds wild to
think about metals boiling,
but the boiling point of
aluminum is around 2,500 Celsius.
Iron boils above 2,800 Celsius,
and there are other
elements in the mixture
like manganese that boil
at just 2,000 Celsius.
Now, once that boiling stops,
the liquid settles down,
and now comes the key
to making pure metal.
The density of liquid iron
is more than twice that
of liquid aluminum oxide.
So iron settles to the bottom
as aluminum oxide floats to the top.
Now, when the metal
melts through the bottom
of the crucible, the first
liquid to pour out is iron.
Only after it has drained
does the aluminum oxide or slag follow.
You can actually see the change
from iron to aluminum oxide.
Liquid iron has a viscosity like water,
so you can see it coming
out there and splashing.
And then the slag starts right there.
Yeah, it comes out smooth.
- [Christof] Really, really cool.
- Whoa.
- [Christof] And this
is more like warm honey.
- [[Derek] Yeah, you can totally see it.
Wow.
It definitely gives you a
sense of being right there.
And you can see the flames
coming off the front.
And it still records.
Look at the bubbles on the glass.
You see those bubbles?
And that beautiful shot
of the iron pouring out.
I mean, this is impressive work
for a camera that's on fire.
We're going to put a cobblestone,
normal street paver inside here.
It's made of limestone.
We'll pour the thermite
on top and then ignite it.
And then we'll see that the
cobblestone is less dense.
Then that solution, it's going
to come up to the surface.
- Yeah.
- Whoa. Okay.
It looks like it's breaking into pieces.
That's a good bit of lava.
- [Axel] Did you see it?
- Oh yes.
Ordinary rocks like cobblestones
rise to the surface,
just like the slag, as the
denser metal drops to the bottom.
And this is key to
producing high purity metal
in the crucible.
So Hans Goldschmidt
had developed a process
to make pure metals like
chromium, copper, and iron.
This could be great for
chemistry in making dyes,
but Hans suspected it could
have even broader applications.
He patented the process in 1895
and wrote it up for publication.
He wrote, "The procedure that I have here
is in its principle so
extraordinarily simple
that I could hardly have
undertaken the time to present,
if not for its surprising
and extraordinary effects."
Thermite was a solution
looking for problems.
One of the first applications of thermite
was to weld metal parts
in remote locations.
- Wherever you need a very,
very strong, very reliable weld
and kind of a remote area
where you don't have the luxury
of bringing, you know, tons of equipment
and tons of welding gear,
that is useful for thermite.
You know, some of the first customers
were in fact shipping companies.
When some shaft would break
in the middle of the ocean,
at the time, you would be lost.
And now having like thermite to be able
to at least fix that in some way
that would get you home
was actually very useful.
It was being able to fix
something or to fix cracks
in engine blocks and to
be super mobile with it,
because you know, like we said,
it takes two guys and the bucket.
- Of course, in this case,
the iron thermite would
actually not produce pure iron,
but rather steel.
This was done by including
carbon and other alloying
elements in the thermite powder.
- Nobody needs pure iron.
Pure iron is actually useless.
It's very soft, it corrodes
immediately even in dry air,
and nobody will want that, right?
- You need iron with some carbon in it.
- Exactly right.
You need iron with some
carbon, that makes it a steel.
- So the majority of
thermite produced today
is steel thermite.
- You have this steel mill that you can,
you know, move wherever
you want it to have.
After the end of the Cold War,
we would use thermite
basically to destroy,
say gun barrels from tanks.
Basically you have a portion of thermite
that you basically stick
into the gun barrel
and then you would ignite it
and then it would basically
weld the gun barrel and destroy it
and it would be completely
useless afterwards.
Those are all kinds of weapons
or stuff that were not useful anymore
that we use thermite to destroy
because it's very quick
and it's very safe.
- And it's very final.
- And it's very final.
Once you've put that in,
there is absolutely no way
of making use of that weapon again.
- A modern application of thermite
is to use the heat generated
to destroy information.
Past a certain temperature,
the Curie temperature,
magnets lose their magnetism.
So information stored
on magnetic hard drives
at high enough temperatures
becomes unrecoverable.
This looks like a very
different form of thermite.
- Yes.
- I'm used to seeing it as a powder.
- Before it was also powder and we dry it.
- Can I pick it up or?
- Yes.
- I mean, it's like a
normal piece of tile.
- Yeah, lay it down.
- Whoa.
(laughs)
That's amazing.
That is cool.
So if we want to make sure no one can read
the information on this hard drive,
I could put this on top?
- Yeah.
- There you go.
When we ignite the crucible,
we have this high temperature
for a short moment.
And here we have it for 10 minutes,
so everything is destroyed.
- So you're controlling the energy release
to make it slower here.
- Yes. The temperature's not so high,
and reaction is slower.
- I am going to light this thermite tile
in all four corners,
and it's going to generate
heat for about 10 minutes,
and we'll see what it does to this laptop.
All right, let's light it.
Ooh, I like this.
See how it's oozing? Whoa.
It's a totally different effect.
Whoa.
Yeah, that's getting hot.
It's getting to the laptop
now. This is really cool.
Like you got to see the molten goo
coming out from underneath that laptop.
That is wild.
After seeing so much thermite,
this is a totally different version of it.
Look at the puddle of metal there.
Oh.
Yeah, nobody's getting
any data off that laptop.
That is awesome.
I did not expect to see
the logo in thermite.
Can I lift it?
- [Christof] Of course.
(both laughing)
- I've never destroyed
data like this before,
but every time I get a spam call,
I wish I could just
magically make the records
of my phone number disappear.
Fortunately, today's
sponsor Incogni can help.
Now, I used to get
several spam calls a day,
which frustrated me so
much that I contemplated
making a video where I would just mess
with these spam callers to
get a small amount of revenge.
But ever since I started
using Incogni back in April,
I no longer have to because
they solve this problem for me.
You see, there are a lot
of data brokers out there
that collect all sorts of
different information about you,
like your name, phone
number, email address,
and even your social security number.
And then they sell this
information on the open market,
which is why you can get calls from people
who you've never even
given your number to.
But Incogni battles these data brokers.
You simply give Incogni permission
and they figure out who has your data.
And then they know which laws apply,
and so they can send the right letter
with the correct legal
terms to each data broker
with the request to
remove your information.
What I love about Incogni is
that it's super easy to use
and it actually works, and
it saved me a ton of time.
So far, they filled out
192 requests on my behalf,
145 of which have been completed,
saving me over 108 hours of work.
And it just keeps running
in the background,
continuously protecting me
against these data brokers.
The best part is that
since I've signed up,
I've hardly gotten any more spam calls.

So I want to thank Incogni for sponsoring
this part of the video,
and now back to thermite.
Now you might think, given
the amount of energy given off
that thermite could be
used as an explosive,
but it's actually not well
suited for that purpose.
- What makes thermite so
interesting and so important
is that you can control it so well.
If you have an explosion,
you can kind of calculate
the energy really well
and say it's, you know,
X amount of megajoules
that you get out,
but it's really hard
to say over what time.
- Maybe one of the reasons
why this is not explosive
is because when you have
explosive reactions,
typically your reactants are solid
and the products are gases,
which obviously expand a lot
and create a lot of pressure.
But in this case, both the reactants
and products are solids?
- They're solids and liquids.
- Yeah, right.
You have so much control
over what's going on.
- Woo. I feel like I
got a sunburn from that.
This property makes it possible
to take down structures
where explosives would
cause too much damage.
In 1933, 4 weeks after Adolf Hitler
became the chancellor of Germany,
the Reichstag building
in Berlin was set on fire
and it would only be fully
repaired 24 years later.
But the burnt out steel
dome had lost its structural
integrity and needed to be removed.
Now, conventional explosives
would've caused irreparable
damage to the rest of the old building.
So on November 22nd, 1957,
thermite charges were strapped
to the dome and when ignited,
they melted through the steel,
which fell neatly into the
former plenary hall below,
allowing the repairs to be completed.
Applications like this are possible
because the thermite reaction
can be carefully controlled.
They have the ingredients so dialed in
that you can actually ignite
thermite indoors without fear
of molten metal flying all over the place.
This mixture includes
some pieces of pure steel.
They don't participate in the reaction,
but they do absorb heat as they melt.
So they help control the rate of reaction
and the temperature reached.
- [Axel] There you go.
- All right.
- That's it.
- That's it?
- Yes.
- I don't think it was in. Oh boy.
Whoa.
Wow.
- It's interesting, like looking
at it through dark glasses,
it looks like a cornbread
muffin or something.
One of the really important
parameters to control is
how long after the reaction
starts does the metal start
flowing out the bottom of the crucible.
This is known as the tap time.
It's critical because if
the tap time is too short,
the metal inside doesn't
fully separate from the slag.
But if the tap time is too long,
then the metal dissolves
more silica from the walls
of the crucible and it
also comes out colder
than it could have been.
- So the chemistry of the
steel actually changes
over the time.
- The longer it stays
in there.
- Exactly.
The log it stays in there,
and this is why it's very
important for us to be able
to control how long it
actually stays there.
- You want the tap time to
be somewhere in the middle,
just right.
We've set up this experiment here to test.
Can we control the time
when the steel comes out?
So the idea is it should
come out of this one first,
then this one, then that one.
We're going to ignite
all three simultaneously
and see what happens.
- You good? 3, 2, 1.
Yes.
They all ignited at almost
exactly the same time,
but the top time of the first crucible,
we got one,
was by far the shortest.
Two.
It'd be amazing if this one stops
and the third one goes,
like that would be very, very impressive.
Come on, third one. Wow.
That's great. That's fantastic.
Another attribute that can be controlled
is the temperature of the metal.
- Here we have two different versions.
So we have a version with 12% damping,
and here we have with 25.
- Sometimes you want the metal to come out
a little hotter or a little colder.
There we go. Nicely controlled ignition.
Well, that one goes a lot more. Wow.
You could see the 12% one went first.
Whoa!
You can see that, you know,
this one starts first,
so you can get a bit of a sense,
but I feel like both
of them reached 2,000.
I don't know.
- The one on the right side
is one of the less dampened portions,
and the other one is one
of the more dampened ones.
We could dramatically
change the temperatures
in both directions,
a little bit higher and
significantly lower.
- [Derek] All of this control is achieved
by carefully adjusting
the thermite mixture.
- This is the starting point
of the making of thermite.
About once or twice a day a truck comes
and drops in this.
This is mill scale.
So this is basically a mixture
of different iron oxides.
When you hot roll steel,
the surface of the steel
is very reactive because it's so hot
and there is so much water
involved to cool the rollers,
so that the surface actually
oxidizes very quickly
and creates this mill scale.
And then they use like water jets
to blow it off the steel surface.
And for the rolling mill,
this is just a waste product, right?
- [Derek] Whoa.
- [Axel] There you go.
- That is cool.
- The mill scale from
outside comes in here
and then gets dried
because thermite and water,
they're not exactly friends
and you want the mill scale
to be as dry as possible
and then stay dry, so
this is how we dry it.
- The iron oxide is
shaken up the spiral ramp
to the top floor, and there,
the particles are separated
into different sizes
and compositions before being
mixed with aluminum powder.
This also has to be very dry, I imagine.
- It's not as much a problem here
because the way that
it's being manufactured
doesn't contain any water.
With the iron oxide,
it's getting blown off
with the water jets.
We have to control all the
elements, the reactive elements,
which is the iron oxide and
the aluminum to make sure
that every portion has their
very defined reactivity.
And then we get the reaction that we want
and also the chemical qualities
in the steel that we want.
- You guys use this word portion.
- Portion, yeah. That's
the word that we use.
A portion is basically
one bag of thermite.
- No cameras.
- [Cameraman] Always
breaking the rules, this guy.
- [Derek] So the portions
are bagged up individually
and stored in the warehouse.
- This is our warehouse, but
this is only one of them.
And this is not even the biggest.
- Can I ask you one question here?
Okay, yesterday we saw
there's a tremendous amount
of energy in thermite
and in this warehouse,
there's a tremendous amount of thermite.
So the question for you is,
is this in any way dangerous?
- It's a fair question.
It's a fair question.
- They set up this
demonstration for me to see
how safe thermite is to handle.
They want me to try to ignite
this full crucible of thermite
with increasing sized ignition sources.
But I wasn't entirely
confident this was a good idea.
Maybe you can help me ignite it.
- Where's Christof?
Have you tried this by the way?
- [Christof] No.
- Well then, under these circumstances,
I would get you some safety gear.
- [Christof] I'm 95% sure
that you cannot ignite it.
- 95?
- There you go.
That's safety gear.
- That's a one in 20.
Is that how we're doing it?
This is a fireproof suit.
- At least there will be footage
how it happened. (laughs)
- So first, here's a little lighter.
All right, let's give it a shot.
See if I can get this to ignite.
Three, two, one.
I'm making some of the thermite
particles here quite hot
so that they are actually glowing orange.
Oh, oh, oh. It's getting quite bright.
Are you getting worried watching that?
- No, not getting worried.
- I heard you make a noise
and I was like, "No, he's getting worried.
I shouldn't keep it on the same spot."
Do you think this whole thing's
going to blow up on my face?
- [Axel] No, I hope not.
- So you can see like even getting it-
- [Axel] Glowing hot.
- Glowing hot,
it still won't ignite.
All right, let's pull out a bigger torch.
I'm going to try with this one.
Got a nice big blue flame there.
I feel like this is not as
hot as the other lighter,
so I'm getting a little
bit of orange there,
but just barely.
We're going to have to
bring out the big guns.
All right, let's torch
it in three, two, one.
Do you think we can build up enough heat?
How hot?
- [Axel] 500.
- Did you say 500?
- [Axel] Yeah.
- I can see a lot of
thermite glowing orange.
There's some pieces coming out.
- Nice and glowing.
- [Christof] 700.
- 700 degrees.
I think this is an excellent demonstration
that thermite is not going to ignite
under normal conditions.
Wow.
- [Axel] There you go. It's still glowing.
- [Derek] Did it melt?
- [Axel] Yeah, that can happen.
- It can melt and not-
- Not ignite.
- Not ignite.
What the.
That is absolutely nuts.
- Obviously, there is a lot
of potential energy here,
but getting that energy is
really, really difficult.
So if it would catch a fire
and, you know, whatever,
the wooden pallets would burn,
you would not be able
to ignite the thermite.
- Would not even.
- No, it would just sit there
and it would just ignore you.
- The key to this lack of
reactivity is the aluminum powder.
- The aluminum is quite stable because
it's covered in aluminum oxide,
and only if it gets so violently heated
that that layer breaks down in
a large number of particles,
then the reaction can start.
- So the aluminum oxide
is like the secret stopper
of thermite?
- [Axel] Exactly.
- The seal.
This reaction has a very
high activation energy,
so it can't be started by a
lighter or a propane torch.
Okay.
This is why we've been using
barium hydroxide igniters.
Basically, the same stuff
that's in sparklers.
- [Christof] Happy New Year.
- It gets hot enough to break
through the aluminum oxide
layer and start the reaction.
- We want to make sure that
the ignition temperature
is so high that it can
only light it deliberately.
