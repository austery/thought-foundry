Hi
 everyone,
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangian
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 so
 wealth
 fund
 and


today
 I'm
 joined
 by
 a
 true
 fintech


pioneer
 who
 has
 transformed
 banking
 in


Latin
 America.
 David
 is
 the
 co-founder


and
 CEO
 of
 New
 Bank,
 one
 of
 the
 world's


largest
 digital
 banks,
 serving
 something


like
 nearly
 120
 million
 customers
 in


Brazil,
 Mexico
 and
 Colombia.
 And
 under


David's
 leadership,
 New
 Bank
 has
 grown


from
 a
 startup
 uh
 to
 one
 of
 the
 most


valuable
 banks
 in
 the
 region.
 So
 David,


a
 warm
 welcome.


Thank
 you,
 Nikolai.
 It's
 a
 pleasure
 to


be
 here
 with
 you.


Now,
 um
 take
 us
 uh
 uh
 take
 us
 back
 to


the
 beginning
 like
 how
 did
 your


upbringing
 shape
 what
 you're
 doing
 now?


Sure.
 So,
 uh
 I
 don't
 come
 from
 a
 family


of
 bankers
 at
 all,
 but
 I
 do
 come
 from
 a


family
 of
 entrepreneurs.
 Uh
 I'm


originally
 from
 Colombia.
 grew
 up
 in
 a


in
 a
 family
 where
 uh
 my
 dad
 had
 11


siblings,
 my
 dad
 had
 my
 mom
 had
 five
 and


they
 were
 all
 mic
 entrepreneurs.
 They


all
 had
 their
 own
 business,
 my
 dad
 as


well.


So,
 what
 did
 you
 guys
 talk
 about
 around


the
 dinner
 table?


Yeah.
 So,
 uh
 the
 understanding
 was
 that


you
 had
 to
 go
 and
 build
 your
 own
 thing


and
 uh
 if
 you
 were
 about
 to
 get
 a
 job
 or


you
 were
 gonna
 try
 to
 manage
 something


that
 was
 look
 up
 front.
 What
 was
 cool
 in


the
 family,
 the
 DNA
 in
 the
 family
 was


starting
 your
 own
 thing
 and
 solving
 a


bunch
 of
 problems.


Is
 that
 a
 DNA
 you
 are
 passing
 on
 to
 your


kids?


Oh,
 absolutely.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think


it's,
 you
 know,
 under
 the


entrepreneurship
 thing,
 it's
 all
 about


finding
 a
 problem
 and
 building
 the


solution
 for
 that
 problem.
 And
 I
 think


it
 has
 they
 had
 this
 kind
 of
 mentality


about
 being
 having
 agency
 and
 solving


problems
 and
 not
 just
 sitting
 down
 and


complaining
 and
 victimizing
 and
 hope


that
 somebody
 else
 is
 going
 to
 solve
 it


for
 you.


You
 went
 to
 school
 in
 the
 US.


That's
 right.
 Uh
 I
 you
 know
 I
 I
 looked
 I


started
 reading
 a
 lot
 about
 computers


and
 technology
 when
 I
 was
 growing
 up.
 I


was
 growing
 up
 in
 Costa
 Rica.
 My
 my


parents
 moved
 to
 Colombia
 uh
 in
 the


early
 90s
 and
 I
 got
 enamored
 about


Silicon
 Valley
 and
 technology,
 what


entrepreneurs
 were
 doing
 over
 there
 and


and
 had
 the
 the
 the
 good
 fortune
 of


being
 able
 to
 make
 it
 to
 Stanford
 and


and and
 I
 wanted
 to
 start
 a
 business


there,
 but
 it
 nothing
 really
 showed
 up


and
 uh
 I
 ended
 up
 taking
 the
 finance


route
 and
 doing
 some
 finance
 for
 a
 few


years
 in
 in
 uh
 in
 New
 York.


Yeah.
 Well,
 it
 wasn't
 it
 wasn't
 uh
 you


know
 uh
 uh
 particularly
 bad
 the
 kind
 of


stuff
 you
 were
 doing.
 I
 mean,
 you
 were


working
 at
 Goldman's,
 Morgan
 Stanley,


uh,
 you
 know,
 General
 Atlantic
 and
 and


Segua.
 It
 doesn't
 get
 much
 better.
 So,


when
 did
 you
 decide
 to
 leave
 all
 these


incredible
 places
 to,
 uh,
 to
 to
 start
 a


new
 bank?
 How,
 how
 did
 it
 come
 about?


Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 they
 were
 phenomenal


places,
 but
 I
 found
 myself
 that
 in
 every


meeting
 I
 had
 with
 an
 entrepreneur,
 be


it
 first
 as
 a
 banker
 or
 then
 as
 a


private
 invest,
 private
 equity
 investor,


I
 secretly
 envied
 the
 person
 on
 the


other
 side
 of
 the
 table.
 I
 I
 I
 just


found
 that
 what
 they
 were
 doing
 was
 so


much
 cool
 actually
 building
 the
 company


and
 hiring
 and
 growing
 and
 expanding
 and


and
 I
 found
 myself
 to
 be
 uh
 in
 a


position
 where
 I
 was
 supposed
 to
 give


them
 advice
 as
 as
 a
 venture
 capital


investor
 but
 I
 had
 no
 idea
 what
 I
 was


doing.
 I
 had
 no
 operating
 experience.
 I


had
 no
 operating
 background
 and
 it
 felt


a
 little
 bit
 like
 a
 force.
 like
 what


what
 what
 give
 me
 the
 the
 the
 the
 credit


of
 telling
 this
 entrepreneur
 what
 they


should
 do
 with
 their
 business
 if
 I've


never
 had
 that
 experience
 and
 and
 I
 kept


connecting
 that
 back
 to
 the
 family


environment
 of
 of
 being
 in
 the


entrepreneur
 and
 putting
 the


entrepreneur
 in
 the
 center
 of
 the
 action


and
 so
 initially
 when
 I
 left
 GA
 to
 go


back
 to
 business
 school
 I
 was
 I
 was


expecting
 to
 use
 the
 business
 school


vacation
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 business


idea
 I
 was
 going
 to
 focus
 on
 but
 that's


when
 Seoia
 called
 me
 and
 said
 no
 come


back,
 help
 us
 uh
 figure
 out
 if
 we
 want


to
 open
 an
 office
 in
 Brazil.
 And
 I


started
 I
 did
 that
 for
 two
 years,
 flying


back
 and
 forth.
 And
 eventually
 they


decided
 that
 they
 didn't
 want
 to
 open
 an


office
 to
 invest.
 And
 for
 me,
 that
 was


the
 moment
 where
 I
 said,
 "Okay,
 fine.
 I


have
 to
 stop
 delaying
 the
 the
 the


building
 a
 business."
 And
 that
 was
 the


moment
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 number
 of
 different


things
 kind
 of
 aligned
 uh
 with
 each


other
 to
 decide
 ultimately
 to
 let's
 go


and
 and
 pursue
 this
 idea.
 So
 what's
 the


first
 thing
 you
 do?
 So
 you
 you
 decide,


okay,
 now
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 go
 for
 it.


I'm
 going
 to
 start
 a
 bank.
 What
 do
 you


what
 do
 you
 do?
 Who
 do
 you
 who
 do
 you


call?
 What
 do
 you
 think?
 What
 do
 you


just
 what
 kind
 of
 stuff
 do
 you
 have
 to


do?


Yeah.
 So
 I
 I
 so
 I
 had
 spent
 a
 lot
 of


time
 in
 looking
 at
 financial
 services
 as


an
 investor
 and
 I
 had
 realized
 how


amazing
 how
 interesting
 and
 and


attractive
 this
 industry
 was
 from
 a


business
 model
 perspective.
 When
 you


look
 at
 Brazil,
 Mexico,
 Colombia
 and


frankly
 almost
 all
 countries
 the
 biggest


companies
 are
 banks
 especially


especially
 countries
 that
 don't
 have


technology
 large
 technology
 companies


now
 as
 you
 would
 look
 at
 the
 US
 but
 in


Brazil
 the
 five
 biggest
 companies
 are


banks
 in
 Mexico
 the
 same
 but
 you
 look
 at


Africa
 you
 look
 at
 emerging
 markets
 it's


always
 banks
 having
 significant
 market


cap
 and
 then
 you
 look
 at
 the
 market


structure
 and
 you
 just
 realize
 that
 four


or
 five
 banks
 generally
 have
 80
 to
 85%


market
 share
 and
 so
 it's
 an
 igopoly
 that


then
 generally
 always
 means
 means
 bad
 uh


products,
 lower
 quality
 uh
 products
 and


services
 for
 consumers,
 lack
 of
 access,


very
 high
 interest
 rate,
 very
 high
 fees,


and
 a
 significant
 percentage
 of
 the


population
 left
 out.


So,
 without
 offending
 the
 Brazilian


banks
 too
 much,
 how
 bad
 were
 they?


They're
 pretty
 bad
 in
 2012.
 There
 was
 I


remember
 we
 looked
 at
 this
 list
 of
 the


top
 10
 most
 hated
 companies
 in
 Brazil


and
 the
 top
 five
 were
 banks
 and
 the


second
 five
 were
 telecom
 companies.


Right


now
 that's
 not
 the
 case.
 I
 think
 we
 like


to
 think
 that
 because
 of
 the
 significant


competition
 we
 brought
 to
 the
 market.


Now
 banks
 are
 actually
 very
 well
 placed


in
 that
 list.
 Um
 and
 uh
 and
 that
 has


been
 an
 enormous
 impact
 that
 we've
 been


able
 to
 create
 through
 bringing
 more


competition.
 But
 at
 that
 time
 it
 was
 an


oligopoly
 that
 hadn't
 really
 seen


competition
 for
 a
 very
 long
 time.
 It
 was


a
 very
 attractive
 industry.
 And
 then


there
 was
 a
 why
 now
 question
 which
 is


this
 digitalization
 of
 the
 economy.


Smartphone
 penetration
 was
 beginning
 to


boom.
 And
 that
 enabled
 the
 possibility


of
 imagining
 competing
 with
 the
 big


banks
 fully
 digitally.
 And
 then
 I
 had
 a


personal
 experience
 at
 that
 time
 as
 as
 I


said
 I'm
 Colombian.
 I'm
 not
 Brazilian.
 I


had
 moved
 to
 Brazil.
 I
 went
 to
 a
 bank
 to


open
 a
 bank
 account.
 And
 it
 was
 the
 most


painful
 uh
 experience
 I've
 I've
 could


possibly
 imagine.
 It
 it
 was
 super


frustrating.
 An
 hour
 and
 a
 half
 sitting


in
 the
 banking
 branch.
 I
 was
 courted
 out


because
 I
 had
 my
 laptop
 in
 my
 in
 my


backpack.
 Lot
 of
 different
 fees.
 It
 took


me
 about
 5
 months
 at
 the
 end
 to
 open
 a


simple
 bank
 account
 and
 a
 credit
 card


that
 charged
 1,200%
 interest
 rates.


It's
 interesting
 when
 you
 go
 into
 a


banking
 building.
 you
 know
 the
 banks
 are


the
 bank
 buildings
 are
 constructed
 so


that
 you
 feel
 intimidated
 that
 you
 feel


small
 uh
 and
 they
 feel
 powerful
 right


that's
 that's
 that's
 exactly
 right
 I


mean
 we
 we
 concluded
 that
 entire


experience
 I
 always
 described
 it
 as
 as


almost
 going
 to
 jail
 like
 literally


because
 you
 you
 would
 go
 into
 these


banking
 branches
 the
 first
 thing
 you


would
 see
 is
 you
 see
 several
 security


armed
 guards
 looking
 at
 you
 had
 to
 go


through
 a
 bulletproof
 door
 that
 had
 a
 a


a
 an
 alarm
 if
 you
 had
 any
 metal
 you
 had


to
 grab
 your
 backpack
 and
 leave
 it
 in
 a


locker
 outside
 the
 branch,
 then
 wait
 for


hours
 to
 get
 to
 get
 service
 from


somebody
 that
 would
 just
 throw
 stuff
 at


you.
 They
 they
 were
 not
 there
 to
 serve


you.
 They
 were
 there
 it
 almost
 you
 had


to
 ask
 for
 a
 favor
 to
 get
 a
 service.
 And


so
 the
 entire
 experience
 seemed
 like
 you


were
 taken
 hostage.
 You
 were
 a
 prisoner


in
 this
 entire
 environment.
 And
 so
 from


a
 consumer
 perspective,
 it
 made
 it
 a


really
 interesting
 opportunity
 to


reinvent.
 And
 that
 was
 that
 was
 the


opportunity.


How
 how
 old
 were
 you
 when
 you
 were


launching
 this?
 I
 was
 32.


Okay.
 So,
 here
 you
 go.
 You
 are
 uh
 here


this
 guy
 uh
 comes
 along,
 launches
 this


purple
 uh
 credit
 card,
 right?
 32
 years


old,
 taking
 on
 the
 big
 banks.
 So,
 what


what
 did
 they
 think
 about
 you?


Yeah.
 So,
 I
 didn't
 finalize
 answering


your
 question,
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 did


once
 once
 all
 of
 this
 kind
 of
 when
 I
 was


excited
 about
 the
 idea
 was
 start
 talking


to
 about
 the
 experts
 and
 the
 industry


experts,
 right?
 So
 here
 it
 is,
 a


Colombian
 in
 Brazil
 walking
 around
 uh


talking
 to
 the
 former
 presidents
 and
 cos


of
 banks.
 And
 it
 was
 amazing
 to
 hear


that
 out
 of
 maybe
 30
 conversations
 I
 had


with
 former
 consultants
 and
 experts,
 the


the
 entire
 consensus
 was
 this
 was
 not


doable.
 It
 was
 impossible.
 You
 have
 no


idea
 what
 you're
 doing
 about
 here
 in


Brazil.
 You
 cannot
 compete
 with
 these


big
 banks.
 The
 regulators
 won't
 let
 you.


You
 won't
 get
 licenses.
 these
 are
 the


most
 powerful
 families
 in
 Brazil
 that


you're
 trying
 to
 compete
 with
 like
 all


these
 arguments
 about
 why
 this
 was


impossible
 to
 do.
 But
 ultimately
 I
 went


back
 to
 the
 experience
 and
 it
 was
 like


how
 can
 consumers
 be
 accepting
 this


experience
 and
 then
 I
 went
 one
 by
 one


trying
 to
 refute
 those
 arguments


including
 for
 example
 regulation.
 I
 went


to
 the
 regulator
 and
 asked
 why
 are
 can


we
 get
 licenses
 to
 compete
 with
 these


big
 banks
 and
 the
 response
 was
 yes
 we


want
 more
 competition
 and
 it
 would
 be


great
 to
 see
 more
 people
 competing
 in


this
 market.
 Did
 the
 the
 big
 bangs
 try


to
 crush
 you?


Well,
 I
 we
 sometimes
 we
 summarize
 the


entire
 kind
 of
 the
 entire
 evolution
 of


of
 the
 past
 12
 years
 for
 us
 as
 as


apparently
 Gandhi
 uh
 used
 to
 say
 there


is
 in
 in
 the
 internet
 a
 phrase
 for


apparently
 from
 him.
 He
 says
 first
 they


ignore
 you,
 then
 they
 laugh
 at
 you,
 then


they
 fight
 you
 and
 then
 you
 win.
 And


we've
 seen
 that
 evolution.
 First
 we
 were


completely
 ignored.
 uh
 they
 had
 no
 idea


that
 we
 existed
 and
 we
 try
 to
 kept
 it


very
 quiet.
 We
 did
 not
 want
 to
 make
 a


lot
 of
 noise.
 We
 launched
 our
 purple


credit
 card
 consumer
 obsessed
 fully
 in


the
 smartphone
 and
 we
 start
 growing


virally
 like
 crazy
 trying
 to
 keep
 it


very
 very
 no
 marketing
 all
 word
 of


mouth.
 Then
 some
 of
 them
 start
 wake
 up


and
 then
 they
 start
 laughing.
 They
 said


well
 it's
 impossible.
 You
 don't
 have


branches.
 People
 are
 never
 going
 to


trust
 on
 your
 brand.
 People
 are
 not


going
 to
 give
 you
 any
 savings
 and
 you


need
 funding.
 you're
 going
 to
 your


credit
 models
 are
 don't
 have
 any
 data
 so


you're
 going
 to
 blow
 up.
 They
 laugh
 and


laugh
 and
 laugh
 and
 ridicule
 for
 a
 very


long
 time.
 And
 I
 would
 say
 over
 the
 past


couple
 years
 now
 they're
 fighting
 and


we're
 definitely
 in
 the
 fighting
 zone.


We're
 now
 competing
 and
 and
 it's
 it's
 a


very
 fair
 competition,
 right?
 It's


competition
 for
 whoever
 offers
 the
 best


product
 for
 consumer.
 So
 we're
 we
 like


that.


Did
 you
 have
 a
 fair
 for
 your
 life?


No,
 it
 never
 got
 to
 that
 point.


Why
 this
 purple
 card?
 Right.
 I
 mean
 I've


seen
 many
 column
 we've
 seen
 many
 credit


cards
 but
 uh
 you
 know
 black
 and
 platinum


and
 all
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff
 but
 purple
 is


a
 bit
 different
 right


and
 that
 was
 that
 was
 exactly
 the
 idea


when
 we
 were
 in
 2013
 and
 we
 looked
 at


all
 the
 banks
 offerings
 which
 by
 the
 way


were
 obviously
 were
 banking
 branch
 they


all
 looked
 exactly
 the
 same
 it
 was
 the


typical
 completely
 red
 ocean


commoditized
 market
 all
 cars
 looked
 the


same
 all
 branches
 look
 the
 same
 all


communications
 look
 the
 same
 all


products
 look
 the
 same
 there
 was
 no


differentiation
 and
 so
 I
 think
 what
 we


wanted
 to
 do
 was
 to
 break
 that


commoditization
 by
 creating
 a
 completely


new
 experience.
 And
 the
 question
 we


asked
 ourselves
 on
 the
 branding
 side
 was


what
 is
 the
 most
 anti-bank
 color
 we
 can


possibly
 come
 up
 with
 and
 that
 was


purple.
 When
 we
 start
 when
 we
 showed
 a


couple
 of
 people
 the
 purple
 color,
 it


created
 uh
 very
 passionate
 responses.


Some
 were
 positive,
 some
 were
 extremely


negative.
 There
 was
 like
 you
 never
 that


that
 color
 branding
 is
 all
 about
 trust


and
 brand
 building
 and
 and
 legacy
 and


and
 being
 around
 for
 centuries
 and
 you


guys
 bring
 this
 modern
 color
 that
 that


is
 very
 different
 than
 the
 red
 or
 the


blue.
 Uh
 but
 we
 wanted
 to
 create
 that


emotion.
 We
 wanted
 to
 create
 some


passion
 and
 and
 u
 and
 so
 from
 that


perspective
 we
 we
 launched
 it
 and
 it
 has


become
 a
 very
 very
 good
 decision
 as
 we


as
 we
 position
 this
 color
 and
 this


branding
 as
 a
 very
 anti-bank.
 In
 fact,


when
 you
 look
 at
 our
 our
 logo
 is
 is
 new


bank.
 New
 is
 symmetrical.
 The
 trick
 we


always
 add
 is
 you
 would
 flip
 it
 around


and
 it
 says
 un
 bank.
 And
 I
 think
 from
 a


from
 um
 we
 do
 offer
 products
 and


financials
 products
 and
 services
 but


then
 everything
 else
 we
 do
 we
 do
 it


differently.
 We
 think
 ourselves
 as
 a


technology
 company
 not
 a
 bank.
 We're


very
 horizontal
 organization.
 We're
 not


a
 hierarchical.
 We
 don't
 use
 any
 titles.


We
 are
 move
 very
 agile.
 We
 really
 are


from
 a
 number
 of
 different
 dimensions.


We
 are
 the
 anti-bank
 as
 as
 we've


executed
 this
 business
 plan.


But
 it's
 pretty
 incredible
 that
 an


anti-bank
 manages
 to
 get
 60%
 of
 the


adult
 population
 in
 Brazil
 as
 customers.


I
 mean,
 it's
 just
 like
 incredible.
 How


is
 it
 possible
 to
 go
 from
 zero
 to
 60%
 of


a
 country?


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 and
 what's
 what


was
 amazing
 is
 is
 it
 was
 all
 word
 of


mouth
 d
 barely
 driven.
 Our
 customer


acquisition
 cost
 has
 been
 two
 $3
 over
 12


years
 getting
 to
 over
 120
 million


customers.
 I
 think
 ultimately
 what
 what


we
 were
 able
 to
 do
 is
 we
 found
 a
 clear


consumer
 pain.
 We
 were
 able
 to
 identify


that
 consumers
 were
 readier
 than


everybody
 expected
 to
 embrace
 a
 new


products
 and
 services.
 The
 fact
 that
 it


was
 fully
 digitally
 in
 the
 moment
 that


the
 entire
 economy
 was
 digitalizing
 that


every
 consumer
 was
 getting
 a
 smartphone


in
 their
 hand
 helped
 a
 lot.
 We
 got
 the


timing
 just
 right
 of
 of
 of
 this
 of
 of


riding
 the
 entire
 uh
 wave
 towards


smartphone
 penetration.
 And
 we
 were
 able


to
 create
 a
 product
 that
 really
 talked


to
 consumers,
 used
 the
 right
 language,


communicated
 almost
 like
 a
 friend,
 like


the
 best
 friend
 of
 of
 consumer
 versus


the
 experience
 that
 banks
 had
 of
 of


prisoners.
 And
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 had
 a


fully
 digital
 business
 model
 meant
 we


don't
 need
 to
 charge
 all
 those
 fees.
 Our


cost
 structure
 is
 20x
 more
 efficient


than
 banks.
 So
 we
 don't
 charge
 all
 those


fees.
 We
 charge
 no
 fees.
 We
 have
 lower


interest
 rates.
 So
 ultimately
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 better
 it's
 a
 superior
 value


proposition
 for
 consumers.


And
 at
 some
 stage
 you
 uh
 there
 was
 a


shortage,
 right?
 So
 not
 everybody
 could


join.
 Is
 that
 right?


That's
 right.
 Since
 we
 one
 of
 the
 key


decisions
 we
 made
 uh
 was
 starting
 with


credit
 first
 where
 you
 look
 at
 detail


banks
 around
 the
 world.
 A
 lot
 of
 start


startups
 and
 detail
 banks
 have
 also
 seen


this
 opportunity
 of
 digitalizing


financial
 services.
 that
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 we
 did
 differently
 was


starting
 with
 credit
 first
 and
 and
 and


that
 was
 a
 key
 decision
 because
 on
 one


end
 it's
 a
 riskier
 decision.
 You
 need


funding
 which
 as
 a
 startup
 was
 really


really
 hard
 to
 get
 to


and
 you
 need
 to
 get
 your
 credit
 models


right
 if
 you
 get
 them
 wrong.
 If
 you
 miss


your
 debt


you
 won't
 get
 a
 second
 chance.
 Investor


will
 be
 not
 forgiven
 if
 you
 if
 you
 get


it
 wrong.
 So,
 but
 the
 pros
 of
 that


strategy
 is
 this
 is
 the
 this
 is
 the


hardest
 thing
 to
 get
 right
 and
 this
 is


70%
 of
 the
 profit
 pool
 of
 financial


services
 and
 this
 is
 where
 the
 biggest


pain
 point
 exist
 with
 more
 with


consumers
 they
 ultimately
 want
 credit


and
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't
 want
 to


provide
 credit


but
 one
 of
 the
 thing
 we
 realized
 is
 as


we
 launched
 the
 credit
 card
 the
 first


credit
 card
 with
 no
 fees
 there
 was
 so


much
 demand
 we
 could
 not
 approve


everybody
 and
 so
 we
 created
 the
 concept


of
 a
 waiting
 list
 and
 instead
 of
 telling


people
 no
 you
 cannot
 have
 the
 card
 we


said
 we
 don't
 know
 yet.
 We
 don't
 have


our
 models
 are
 not
 mature
 enough.
 Give


us
 a
 couple
 of
 give
 us
 a
 little
 time
 and


if
 you
 get
 invited
 by
 your
 friends,


you'll
 get
 priority.
 And
 we
 start
 using


that
 data
 of
 invitation
 as
 one
 of
 the


most
 important
 variables
 in
 our
 credit


model.
 And
 that
 ultimately
 enabled
 what


was
 a
 scarce
 product
 to
 become
 even


scarcer
 because
 people
 were
 in
 a
 waiting


list
 and
 they
 wanted
 more.


It's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 nightclub
 strategy
 this.


No,


exactly.
 people
 want
 to
 go
 to
 whatever


place
 has
 the
 biggest
 waiting
 list
 and


we
 had
 over
 a
 million
 people
 in
 the


waiting
 list
 for
 a
 very
 long
 time.


Oh
 my
 wow
 that's
 uh
 that
 that's


incredible.
 Now
 our
 mutual
 friend
 Mala


Gar
 um
 who's
 an
 extremely
 accomplished


investor
 uh
 said
 I
 need
 to
 spend
 some


time
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 about
 net
 promoter


score
 because
 you
 are
 supposedly
 just


totally
 obsessed
 about
 it.
 So
 uh
 David


just
 first
 what
 is
 a
 what
 is
 net


promoter
 score
 and
 why
 is
 it
 important?


Yeah,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 metric
 we've
 always


used
 and
 now
 a
 lot
 of
 consumer
 companies


use
 to
 measure
 uh
 the
 probability
 that


somebody
 will
 recommend
 your
 product
 and


so
 it's
 a
 metric
 that
 has
 a
 lot
 of


correlation
 and
 causation
 with
 viral


growth.
 is
 very
 clear.
 Obviously,
 if


people
 really
 like
 a
 product
 and
 they


recommend
 it
 to
 their
 friends,
 then
 you


will
 be
 able
 to
 grow
 virally,
 you'll


create
 this
 this
 kind
 of
 recommendation


engine
 that
 has
 been.


So,
 you
 basically
 ask
 people,
 do
 you
 you


uh
 uh
 you
 know,
 would
 you
 recommend
 this


product?
 And
 then
 you
 take
 the
 people


who
 want
 to
 and
 subtract
 the
 people
 who


don't
 want
 to.
 And
 then
 you
 get
 a


number,
 right?


Yeah.
 From
 1
 to
 10,
 what
 is
 the


likelihood
 that
 you
 would
 recommend
 this


product
 and
 you
 get
 the
 promoters
 and


then
 you
 subtract
 the
 detractors,
 the


one
 that
 would
 never
 would
 not
 recommend


this
 product.


And
 what
 number
 did
 you
 have?
 And
 so


when
 we
 launched
 we
 had
 an
 NPS
 of
 90.


This
 is
 100.
 This
 was
 one
 of
 the
 highest


NPS
 of
 any
 consumer
 products
 that
 we've


ever
 seen.
 Um
 once
 in
 a
 meeting
 somebody


told
 me
 that
 Tesla
 had
 a
 higher
 NPS
 than


our
 purple
 credit
 card
 and
 I
 was
 really


bummed
 until
 we
 launched
 our
 credit
 card


in
 Mexico
 and
 then
 that
 had
 a
 NPS
 of
 94.


So
 our
 credit
 card
 in
 Mexico
 had
 the


highest
 NPS
 of
 any
 consumer
 product
 in


the
 world
 of
 any
 category.
 It's
 crazy
 to


think
 about
 that
 a
 credit
 card
 can
 have


a
 higher
 NPS
 than
 a
 Tesla
 or
 than
 an


iPhone.
 But
 that
 just
 tells
 you
 that
 the


level
 of
 consumer
 paying
 these
 consumers


were
 in
 the
 ability
 to
 create
 a
 product


that
 truly
 matches
 the
 needs
 of
 these


consumers.


But
 I
 also
 heard
 that
 for
 instance
 you


apologized
 to
 your
 customers
 because
 you


had
 overcharged
 them.


That's
 a
 that's
 a
 great
 story.
 Yeah.
 I


mean
 we
 um
 we


Well,
 it's
 true.
 No,
 it's
 true.
 It
 it
 is


true
 and
 it's
 a
 story
 that
 we
 that
 we


tell
 our
 employees
 or
 tell
 our
 friends.


Our
 number
 one
 mission
 as
 a
 company
 or


number
 one
 cultural
 value
 is
 we
 want


customers
 to
 love
 us
 fanatically.
 We


think
 that
 in
 the
 long
 run
 consumer
 love


is
 correlated
 with
 with
 value
 of
 the


company
 with
 financial
 returns.
 In
 the


short
 term
 that
 might
 not
 be
 correlated


but
 in
 the
 long
 run
 those
 two
 things
 go


in
 the
 same
 direction.
 And
 the
 story


you're
 mentioning
 is
 one
 day
 uh
 there


was
 a
 bug
 in
 our
 system
 and
 we
 stopped


reminding
 customers
 to
 pay
 on
 time.
 And


so
 they
 overpaid
 a
 couple
 of
 days
 of


late
 interest.
 And
 it
 was
 very
 easy
 for


our
 team
 to
 know
 what
 was
 what
 we
 needed


to
 do.
 We
 had
 to
 put
 back
 those
 emails


reminding
 customers
 to
 pay
 on
 time,
 but


then
 also
 go
 back
 to
 the
 customers
 that


had
 that
 we
 had
 forgotten
 to
 remind


them,
 give
 them
 their
 money
 back
 and


apologize
 for
 not
 having
 remind
 them
 to


pay
 on
 time.
 And
 and
 if
 you
 think
 about


it,
 well
 then,
 yeah,
 we're
 making
 less


money
 in
 the
 short
 term,
 and
 that's


true.
 But
 in
 the
 long
 run,
 what
 is
 the


value
 as
 a
 customer
 if
 somebody


proactively
 tells
 you,
 "Sorry,
 we
 didn't


remind
 you
 several
 times
 to
 pay
 on
 time


and
 here's
 your
 money
 back
 without
 you


even
 noticing
 it."
 That's
 kind
 of


ultimately
 the
 bet
 of
 the
 company
 is


that
 we
 think
 that
 those
 type
 of


experiences
 will
 drive
 long-term
 value


creation
 and
 loyalty
 with
 consumers
 for


a
 very
 long
 time.


What
 kind
 of
 responsibility
 do
 you
 think


a
 bank
 has
 towards
 the
 society
 where
 it


operates?


I
 think
 it
 has
 huge
 responsibility.
 I


mean
 financial
 services
 is
 one
 of
 those


core
 services
 that
 anybody
 in
 any


society
 in
 any
 country
 needs
 to
 have


access
 to
 to
 be
 able
 to
 parade
 and
 form


part
 of
 a
 of
 of
 the
 economic
 life.


Right?
 If
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 bank
 account


in
 most
 countries
 you
 are
 completely


marginalized.
 If
 you
 don't
 have
 access


to
 credit
 your
 potential
 for
 value


creation
 or
 or
 to
 start
 your
 own


business
 or
 to
 start
 your
 own
 job
 it


gets
 significantly
 handicapped.
 or
 if


you
 cannot
 invest
 in
 in
 in
 a
 in
 in
 good


products,
 you're
 not
 going
 your


opportunity
 to
 create
 wealth
 for
 a
 very


period
 of
 time
 is
 going
 to
 be
 really


hindered.
 So
 we
 think
 it's
 it's
 a


critical
 value
 in
 society
 and
 if
 we
 can


bring
 more
 competition
 to
 the
 banking


markets
 and
 more
 efficiency
 through
 our


business
 model
 and
 give
 more
 access,
 we


think
 there
 is
 huge
 societal
 impact
 as


as
 we
 do
 the
 job
 that
 we
 we
 do
 every


day.


Okay.
 So
 now
 you
 have
 the
 purple
 card,


you've
 conquered
 uh
 Brazil
 with
 a
 card.


What
 do
 you
 do
 then?


So
 just
 how
 do
 you
 think
 how
 do
 you


think
 about
 more
 products
 more


geographies
 just
 what's
 going
 on
 through


your
 mind
 here?


Right.
 So
 the
 end
 goal
 was
 always
 to


build
 a
 a
 fully
 digital
 bank.
 It
 was
 not


a
 digital
 credit
 card.
 The
 issue
 though


is
 we
 had
 to
 create
 this
 tactical
 plan


where
 we
 would
 launch
 credit
 card.
 We


would
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 fund
 that
 credit


card
 growth
 and
 in
 parallel
 try
 to
 get
 a


banking
 license.
 Getting
 a
 banking


license
 was
 very
 hard
 in
 Brazil.
 It
 took


us
 over
 four
 years
 to
 get
 one.
 Just
 to


give
 you
 one
 data
 point
 of
 how
 protected


this
 market
 was,
 Brazil
 is
 only
 one
 of


the
 few
 countries
 in
 the
 world
 where


it's
 in
 the
 constitution
 of
 the
 country


that
 foreigners
 cannot
 invest
 in
 banks.


So
 it
 required
 a
 special
 presidential


exception
 to
 get
 a
 foreign
 to
 have
 a


bank
 and
 and
 that
 happened.
 Obviously,


there
 were
 some
 foreign
 banks
 operating


in
 Brazil,
 but
 for
 us
 as
 a
 startup,
 it


took
 us
 four
 years
 to
 navigate
 the


entire
 political
 environment
 to


ultimately
 get
 to
 get
 that
 presidential


decree,
 get
 the
 banking
 license,
 and


then
 launch
 a
 savings
 product.
 And
 our


savings
 product
 was
 very
 simple.
 We
 paid


100%
 yield
 to
 any
 consumer
 deposit.


And
 we
 gave
 real
 time
 free
 payments
 uh


transfers
 between
 accounts.
 It
 was


amazing
 how
 again
 that
 simple
 design


created
 a
 huge
 viral
 growth
 in
 the


market
 and
 allowed
 us
 to
 go
 from


something
 like
 50
 million
 customers
 at


that
 point
 to
 60
 70
 80
 million
 customers


um
 in
 about
 two
 three
 years
 becoming


today
 the
 largest
 bank
 account
 in
 in
 in


the
 country
 and
 the
 largest
 primary
 bank


account.
 So
 once
 we
 have
 savings
 and


credit
 then
 we've
 been
 growing
 in
 two


vectors.
 The
 first
 one
 has
 been
 more


products.
 We
 launched
 consumer
 loans,
 an


investments
 platform,
 crypto,
 insurance,


and
 now
 we're
 uh
 expanding
 also
 to
 small


businesses.
 And
 the
 second
 vector
 has


been
 internationalizing


through
 Mexico
 and
 Colombia.
 And
 for


now,
 we're
 very
 focused
 on
 these
 three


countries
 as
 this
 is
 a
 model
 that


requires
 a
 lot
 of
 focus
 and
 requires
 to


go
 very
 very
 deep
 in
 the
 countries
 that


we
 operate
 with
 licenses,
 with
 credit.


So


when
 should
 a
 company
 expand
 into
 a
 new


country?
 we
 had
 um
 a
 a
 checklist
 of


things
 that
 needed
 to
 be
 true
 to
 expand.


Uh
 this
 is
 this
 is
 again
 I
 think
 there


are
 some
 financial
 services
 products


that
 are
 easily
 internationalizable
 that


requires
 little
 localization
 but
 doing


banking
 with
 banking
 licenses
 in
 credit


requires
 a
 huge
 amount
 of
 localization.


So
 for
 us
 uh
 it
 required
 first
 to
 be


profitable
 in
 our
 core
 market.
 We
 had
 to


be
 profitable
 and
 and
 demonstrate
 to


investors
 that
 we
 could
 generate


earnings
 in
 Brazil.
 Second,
 have
 the


banking
 license,
 which
 meant
 having
 the


right
 funding
 to
 continue
 growing
 our


credit
 book.
 And
 third,
 um,
 do
 being


able
 to
 do
 it
 in
 a
 way
 where
 our
 credit


and
 our
 technology
 platform
 allowed
 us


to
 launch
 a
 new
 country
 without
 a


without
 needing
 to
 dedicate
 half
 of
 our


entire
 headcount.
 So,
 you
 could


effectively
 make
 it
 as
 a
 as
 a
 as
 a
 as
 a


co-op
 option
 on
 a
 new
 market
 versus


investing
 the
 house
 on
 winning
 the
 new


market.


How
 different
 are
 these
 markets
 to


operate
 in?


There's
 there
 are
 some
 significant


differences.
 Um
 so
 for
 example
 Mexico
 as


we
 launched
 Mexico
 and
 to
 and
 similarly


Colombia
 Colombia
 more
 similar
 to
 Mexico


the
 story
 in
 Brazil
 was
 there
 was
 a
 big


banking
 population
 and
 we
 were
 able
 to


offer
 a
 product
 that
 was
 lower
 cost
 to


the
 bank
 customers
 and
 then
 there
 was
 a


smaller
 unbanked
 population.
 When
 you


look
 at
 Mexican
 Colombia
 credit


penetration
 or
 credit
 card
 penetration


is
 12%.
 So
 88%
 of
 the
 entire
 market
 is


doesn't
 have
 access
 to
 credit
 and
 cash


is
 very
 much
 still
 available
 and
 it's
 a


lot
 of
 informal
 economy.
 So
 in
 markets


like
 Mexico,
 we
 have
 to
 go
 a
 little
 bit


slower
 in
 in
 creating
 a
 a
 payment


infrastructure
 and
 building
 our
 credit


models
 that
 will
 allow
 us
 to
 increase


the
 size
 of
 the
 pie,
 the
 size
 of
 the


credit
 pie.
 Brazil
 was
 a
 very
 different


story,
 but
 there's
 some
 there
 are


generally
 some
 commonalities
 though
 of


the
 business
 model.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 our
 competitors
 are
 cash
 and
 the


big
 income
 banks
 that
 are
 operating
 in


branches.
 And
 once
 we
 compete,
 we
 know


branches.
 We
 have
 this
 cost
 structure


advantage
 that
 allows
 us
 to
 give
 lower


products,
 better
 products
 at
 lower
 cost.


And
 those
 first
 principles
 apply
 to
 all


of
 these
 markets
 that
 we
 operate.
 So,


some
 commonalities,
 some
 differences.


When
 will
 you
 enter
 the
 US?


We're
 not
 there
 yet.
 And
 we're
 still


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 comes
 of
 out


of
 these
 three
 markets.
 But
 uh
 but


certainly
 over
 the
 next
 five
 10
 years
 we


want
 to
 expand
 beyond
 these
 three


markets
 beyond
 Latin
 America
 and
 it's


and
 it's
 uh
 this
 is
 a
 really
 big
 market.


It's
 the
 biggest
 market
 in
 the
 world.


It's
 very
 competitive.
 So
 you
 would
 have


to
 figure
 out
 exactly
 what
 is
 what
 what


would
 be
 the
 edge,
 what
 would
 be
 the


entry
 path.
 But
 uh
 we're
 in
 the
 process


of
 figuring
 out
 that


internationalization
 strategy.


So
 what
 would
 be
 your
 edge?
 I
 mean
 how


how
 much
 better
 service
 can
 you
 offer?


So
 that
 depends.
 uh
 we
 are
 we're


figuring
 out
 what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the


niches
 that
 have
 that
 consumer
 pain
 any


of
 those
 exist
 in
 the
 US
 or
 other


countries
 not
 fully
 ready
 yet
 to
 talk


about
 in
 our
 internationalization


strategy
 beyond
 the
 three
 countries
 that


we
 operate
 but
 uh
 but
 yeah
 uh
 we
 we
 we


we
 think
 over
 a
 10-year
 horizon
 this
 is


a
 model
 that
 should
 internationalize
 and


should
 have
 uh
 should
 be
 the
 opposite
 or


should
 be
 the
 alternative
 to
 traditional


banking
 markets


but
 how
 much
 fun


it
 is


how
 big
 is
 new
 bank
 in
 20
 is


woof
 um
 you
 know
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 it's
 10


to
 100
 exercise
 that
 we
 have
 right
 now


uh
 financial
 services
 is
 the
 biggest


segment
 of
 the
 world
 economy
 today
 it's


over
 $8
 trillion
 of
 profit
 and
 still
 99%


is
 still
 dominated
 by
 banks
 with


branches
 even
 though
 there's
 been
 huge


amount
 of
 progress
 in
 technology
 and


there
 is
 crypto
 there
 is
 stable
 coins


and
 everybody
 talk
 about
 these


technologies
 most
 banking
 today
 is
 still


on
 in
 banks
 that
 are
 using
 physical
 cash


and
 banking
 branches.
 And
 you
 still
 have


three
 billion
 people
 outside
 the
 banking


system
 in
 emerging
 markets.
 You
 still


have
 three
 four
 billion
 people
 that
 are


completely
 left
 out
 of
 the
 banking


market.
 They
 don't
 have
 access
 to


credit.
 They're
 not
 investing.
 They're


not
 buying
 crypto
 products.
 They're
 not


even
 in
 the
 formal
 economy.
 So
 this
 is


this
 is
 today
 the
 early
 early
 minutes
 of


of
 the
 game.
 And
 the
 bet
 is
 that
 in
 20


years
 this
 entire
 market
 will
 digitalize


and
 there
 will
 be
 digitally
 native


technology
 companies
 dominating
 a
 lot
 of


these
 markets
 and
 we
 think
 we
 are


extremely
 well
 positioned
 to
 to
 take
 a


very
 significant
 percentage
 of
 this
 of


this
 market.


You
 mentioned
 that
 you
 were
 20
 times


more
 efficient
 and
 of
 course
 when
 you


when
 you
 started
 up
 you
 didn't
 have
 any


of
 these
 really
 expensive
 legacy
 systems


which
 you
 know
 big
 banks
 have.
 Uh
 but
 um


10
 years
 from
 now,
 isn't
 your
 system


going
 to
 look
 a
 bit
 oldfashioned


or
 how
 do
 you
 just
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you


work
 on
 this?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think


there's
 two
 sides
 of
 the
 efficiency.
 The


first
 one
 is
 is
 the
 distribution
 model


is
 the
 f
 the
 fact
 that
 we're
 fully


digitally
 from
 day
 one.
 Even
 digital


banks
 today
 or
 or or
 traditional
 banks


that
 have
 digitalized
 some
 of
 our


competitors
 in
 Brazil,
 for
 example,
 they


have
 digitalized
 a
 lot,
 but
 they
 have


100
 million
 customers
 with
 a
 100,000


employees.
 we
 have
 100
 million
 customers


with
 6,000
 employees.
 So
 there
 is
 the


cost
 structure
 advantage
 and
 that's
 the


efficiency
 side
 and
 then
 there's
 the


technology
 point
 that
 you
 mentioned.
 Um


given
 we
 are
 cloud
 native
 and
 all
 of
 our


products
 and
 services
 are
 fully
 in
 the


cloud.
 Yes,
 of
 course
 there'll
 be
 a


number
 of
 different
 systems
 that
 need
 to


be
 rearchitected
 and
 rescaled.
 Right


now,
 we're
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 that
 as


we're
 becoming
 internationally
 and
 ready


to
 go
 to
 more
 countries.
 But
 it's
 just


much
 easier
 to
 continually
 be
 updating


your
 own
 tech
 stack
 when
 you're
 fully
 on


the
 cloud
 versus
 when
 you
 have
 to
 spend


5
 to
 10
 years
 to
 put
 your
 entire
 core


banking
 system
 in
 the
 cloud,
 which
 is


what
 most
 banks
 more
 traditional
 banks


around
 the
 world
 are
 still
 trying
 to
 do.


So
 um


when
 you
 look
 at
 your
 tech
 your
 tech
 uh


uh
 stack,
 what
 what
 opportunities
 uh


when
 it
 comes
 to
 AI
 are
 you
 the
 most


excited
 about?
 So
 the
 one
 I'm
 the
 most


excited
 about
 is
 probably
 the
 one
 least


talked
 about,
 which
 is
 the
 way
 financial


services
 is
 going
 to
 be
 reimagined
 in
 in


in
 the
 AI
 world.
 Because
 the
 way
 I
 think


about
 it
 is
 mobile
 and
 the
 internet


solved
 almost
 all
 banking
 inclusion
 at


least
 for
 banking
 services
 or
 payments.


Almost
 the
 entire
 population
 today
 of


the
 world
 has
 access
 to
 a
 payment


wallet.
 Um,
 but
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 that


they've
 solved
 banking
 for
 the
 99%
 of


the
 world
 population.
 They
 still
 don't


have
 access
 to
 credit.
 They
 still
 don't


have
 access
 to
 true
 financial
 advice.


So,
 the
 way
 we
 think
 about
 it
 is
 if


mobile
 put
 a
 bank
 in
 everybody's


pockets,
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 put
 a
 bank
 and
 a


banker
 in
 everybody's
 pockets.
 You're


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 the
 most


sophisticated


financial
 expert
 handh
 holding
 the
 hand


of
 every
 single
 person
 on
 earth.
 And
 if


you
 think
 about
 what
 that
 means
 in
 terms


of
 optimizing
 people's
 wealth
 of


allowing
 people
 to
 invest
 in
 the
 right


products
 to
 be
 financially
 sophisticated


of
 making
 banks
 compete
 to
 give
 the


lowest
 cost
 loan
 of
 providing
 advice
 or


where
 should
 you
 buy
 insurance
 or
 not


there
 is
 so
 much
 wealth
 to
 be
 created


for
 very
 significant
 percent
 of
 the


population
 that
 I
 get
 very
 excited
 about


that
 potential
 for
 AI.
 So
 uh
 that's
 on


the
 user
 interface
 side
 uh
 and
 still
 a


few
 years
 away
 I
 I
 believe
 and
 then


there's
 obviously
 some
 of
 the
 older


applications
 that
 most
 companies
 talk


about
 part
 of
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 uh


customer
 service
 but
 also
 significant
 uh


opportunities
 around
 improving
 credit


models
 as
 you
 use
 neural
 networks
 in


using
 credit
 underwriting
 fraud


applications
 collections
 applications
 uh


optimization
 of
 capital
 optimization
 of


KYCL


So
 effectively
 every
 single
 thing
 that
 a


bank
 does
 can
 be
 optimized
 through
 AI


and
 uh
 that
 can
 become
 a
 core
 part
 of
 of


the
 entire
 bank
 in
 the
 cloud.


How
 worried
 are
 you
 about
 some
 um
 big


tech
 companies
 Google,
 Apple
 and
 so
 on


um
 about
 them
 entering
 the
 financial


services?
 I
 think
 this
 is
 an
 area
 where


uh
 they
 will
 likely
 enter
 at
 the
 end
 if


they
 ever
 do
 and
 if
 they
 do
 they
 will
 be


just
 be
 trying
 to
 possibly
 grab
 some


payments
 uh
 profit
 pools
 uh
 or
 more
 of


an
 marketplace
 environment
 but
 this
 is


such
 a
 regulated
 environment


uh
 and
 you've
 seen
 it
 we've
 seen
 over


the
 past
 10
 years
 when
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 big


techs
 have
 tried
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit


into
 India
 they've
 tried
 to
 got
 a
 little


bit
 into
 the
 US
 a
 little
 bit
 in
 Brazil


They
 never
 really
 went
 all
 in
 because


the
 moment
 they
 went
 all
 in
 and
 they


need
 to
 get
 a
 banking
 license,
 they
 get


incredibly
 regulated.
 You
 even
 see
 with


Apple
 as
 they
 launched
 Apple
 Card
 in
 the


US
 where
 they
 just
 relied
 on
 banks
 as


partners.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 they'll
 play


somehow
 they
 will
 want
 to
 be
 uh


activated.
 It
 is
 very
 possible
 the
 new
 a


the
 new
 bank
 AI
 agent
 will
 be
 in
 Gemini


or
 will
 be
 in
 charge
 JPT
 and
 you'll
 be


able
 to
 buy
 um
 you
 know
 your
 travel


ticket
 using
 a
 credit
 loan
 enabled
 by


our
 AI
 agent
 inside
 one
 of
 these
 big


platforms
 but
 I
 don't
 see
 them
 necess
 I


don't
 see
 them
 giving
 credit
 I
 don't
 see


them
 grabbing
 savings
 of
 a
 customer


that's
 there's
 a
 line
 here
 that
 I
 think


they
 will
 they
 might
 not
 cross


moving
 on
 to
 uh
 just
 leadership
 and
 um


just
 how
 that
 has
 evolved.
 Uh
 when
 you


started
 you
 were
 a
 founder
 and
 an
 SEO


now
 you
 are
 SEO
 and
 very
 big
 companies


just
 how
 um
 how
 have
 you
 developed
 as
 a


leader?


It's
 been
 a
 long
 road
 about
 learning
 how


to
 figure
 it
 out.
 I
 think
 the
 the
 the


leadership
 aspect
 of
 the
 founder
 was


easier.
 I
 think
 the
 founder
 sets
 up
 a


vision
 and
 motivates
 the
 team
 to
 pursue


that
 vision
 and
 that
 continues


irrespective
 of
 the
 size
 of
 the
 company.


So
 there
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 leadership


task
 to
 be
 done
 as
 a
 founder
 is
 I
 would


say
 is
 much
 clearer.
 What
 I
 personally


have
 found
 harder
 is
 what
 the
 CEO
 does


and
 the
 difference
 between
 the
 founder


and
 the
 CEO.
 What
 where
 does
 the


managing
 come
 in?
 I
 I
 find
 that
 that


become
 going
 from
 a
 founder
 to
 a
 CEO
 of


a
 large
 company
 it's
 a
 harder
 transition


to
 be
 made.


What's
 hard
 about
 it?
 What's
 the


difficult
 thing
 here?


I
 think
 I
 think
 for
 a
 long
 time
 I


thought
 that
 what
 that
 meant
 was
 I
 had


to
 become
 a
 better
 manager.
 It
 was
 the


management
 capabilities.
 It
 was
 doing


the
 one-on-
 ons.
 It
 was
 the
 coaching


aspect
 of
 being
 a
 CEO.
 And
 it
 doesn't
 a


lot
 of
 times
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 come


naturally
 to
 a
 founder
 because
 I
 think


the
 founder
 by
 by
 default
 is
 less


patient
 is
 more
 actionoriented.
 They


want
 things
 now.
 They
 uh
 they
 don't
 want


to
 create
 necessarily
 processes
 and


sometimes
 the
 company
 in
 certain


processes.
 And
 so
 um
 it
 almost
 required


creating
 a
 number
 of
 new
 uh
 skill
 sets.


And
 I
 think
 for
 a
 while
 for
 a
 few
 years


we
 try
 to
 create
 all
 of
 those
 skill


sets.
 We
 brought
 more
 professional


managers
 into
 the
 organization.
 And
 we


try
 to
 uh
 instill
 the
 practices
 of


bigger
 companies.
 But
 I
 actually


realized
 over
 the
 past
 year
 that
 if
 you


instill
 the
 practices
 of
 bigger
 company,


you
 become
 a
 bigger
 company.
 And
 that's


actually
 not
 what
 you
 want.
 You
 want
 to


maintain
 the
 sense
 of
 urgency,
 the


perhaps
 impatience,
 the
 the
 the
 the
 kind


of
 the
 act
 the
 bias
 for
 action
 of
 the


startup,
 but
 then
 you
 also
 want
 to
 be


integrating
 with
 certain
 light
 processes


and
 with
 very
 strong
 people
 that
 allows


you
 to
 execute
 a
 large
 organization.
 So


today
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 answer
 is
 you


need
 to
 become
 a
 very
 big
 manager
 of
 a


large
 organization.
 I
 think
 the
 answer


is
 more
 about
 you
 need
 to
 do
 a
 little


managing
 but
 ultimately
 leading
 with
 the


vision
 and
 integr
 and
 bringing
 a
 great


team
 and
 maintaining
 an
 organizational


structure
 that
 is
 very
 horizontal
 and


very
 agile
 is
 is
 is
 the
 is
 the
 is
 the


highest
 priority
 um
 the
 highest
 priority


action
 to
 maintain
 the
 company
 young
 and


and
 active.


Why
 have
 you
 been
 a
 successful
 founder?


H
 I
 think
 it's
 um
 I
 think
 I
 have
 the


vision.
 I
 I
 I
 can
 I
 can
 I
 can
 you
 know
 I


I
 I
 I
 can
 articulate
 where
 we
 want
 to
 go


and
 the
 opportunity
 that
 we
 have
 as
 an


organization
 but
 I
 think
 I've
 been
 able


to
 also
 bring
 phenomenal
 people
 around


me
 that
 fill
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 gaps
 that
 I


have
 from
 my
 experience.
 So
 I
 said
 I
 was


an
 immigrant
 Colombian
 immigrant
 in


Brazil
 that
 never
 worked
 for
 a
 bank
 that


never
 do
 a
 credit
 card
 that
 never


necessarily
 was
 a
 technologist
 that


build
 a
 technology
 company
 in
 Brazil


with
 banking.
 And
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that,


it
 required
 the
 ability
 to
 bring
 a
 lot


of
 great
 people
 that
 had
 that
 skill
 set


and
 create
 an
 environment
 where
 they
 all


could
 do
 the
 best
 job
 of
 their
 lives.


And
 I
 think
 I've
 been
 able
 to
 do
 that


effectively.
 Uh
 I
 think
 the
 last
 thing
 I


would
 say
 is
 just
 actively
 realizing


that
 you
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 mistakes
 that
 I


make
 a
 lot
 of
 mistakes
 and
 having
 the


humility
 to
 recognize
 that
 uh
 we
 don't


have
 all
 the
 answers
 that
 I'll
 make


mistakes
 but
 we'll
 learn
 from
 them
 and


sharing
 that
 with
 the
 team
 so
 that
 we


create
 an
 environment
 in
 the


organization
 where
 we
 can
 take
 risk
 we


can
 make
 mistakes
 where
 there
 is
 is
 this


as
 low
 ego
 as
 as
 we
 can
 possibly
 have


and
 there
 is
 a
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of


learning
 across
 the
 entire
 organization.


What
 are
 the
 biggest
 mistakes
 you
 made?


Ah
 uh
 I
 think
 generally
 has
 been
 related


to
 building
 the
 team.
 Um
 one
 of
 the


maybe
 the
 hardest
 thing
 I
 found
 as
 we've


scaled
 over
 the
 past
 12
 years
 has
 been


realizing
 that


the
 the
 number
 one
 job
 I
 have
 as
 the
 CEO


is
 figuring
 out
 if
 everybody
 around
 me


in
 that
 team
 is
 the
 right
 person
 given


the
 challenges
 of
 the
 organization.
 And


one
 day
 I
 look
 around
 and
 I
 have
 an
 kind


of
 conclusion
 that
 yes
 I
 have
 everybody


everybody
 here
 is
 the
 right
 setup.
 But


when
 you
 are
 doubling
 or
 tripling
 or


quadrupling
 in
 size
 every
 six
 months,


six
 months
 after
 you
 look
 around
 the


room
 and
 that's
 not
 true
 anymore
 and


because
 companies
 grow
 exponentially
 and


we
 humans
 grow
 linearly
 and
 so
 at
 some


point
 the
 exponential
 complexity
 is


above
 our
 human
 capacity
 to
 learn
 and


that
 means
 bringing
 new
 talent
 into
 the


organization.


Bringing
 that
 talent
 consistently
 and


having
 that
 bar
 has
 been
 I
 think
 the


hardest
 thing
 to
 do
 and
 and
 making
 the


right
 assessment
 around
 the
 right
 people


in
 the
 team
 has
 been
 the
 hardest
 and


where
 I
 perhaps
 have
 made
 too
 slow
 of
 a


decision
 of
 making
 a
 change
 or
 not
 made


the
 right
 hire
 nor
 made
 the
 right
 um
 uh


the
 right
 setup
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 team.


It's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 an
 apprenticeship
 uh


business,
 you
 know,
 uh
 being
 a
 venture


capitalist,
 I
 I
 think.
 And
 um
 you
 you


trained
 at
 uh
 at
 Sequoia.
 What
 did
 you


learn
 there?


I
 I
 think
 I
 learned
 um


and
 I
 think
 that that
 ultimately
 were


lessons
 that
 took
 me
 as
 an
 entrepreneur,


you
 know,
 as
 an
 investor,
 right?
 The


first
 thing
 I
 learned
 is
 that
 I
 I
 I
 did


not
 want
 to
 be
 an
 investor.
 I
 wanted
 to


be
 an
 entrepreneur
 because
 I
 really


wanted
 to
 be
 in
 in
 the
 arena
 building
 it


with
 my
 own
 hands
 and
 and
 I
 and
 I
 and
 I


found
 that
 it
 was
 too
 easy
 for
 the


investor
 to
 provide
 that
 advice.
 But


beyond
 that,
 I
 think
 there
 were
 a
 couple


of
 key
 questions
 from
 an
 investor
 angle


that
 are
 very
 important
 for
 the


entrepreneur
 angle.
 The
 first
 question


was
 is
 this
 an
 attractive
 and
 big
 market


to
 disrupt?
 The
 investor
 has
 to
 make


that
 qu
 that
 has
 to
 answer
 that


question.
 The
 entrepreneur
 has
 to
 answer


that
 question
 because
 as
 an


entrepreneur,
 you're
 investing,
 you're


going
 all
 in.
 You're
 not
 just
 writing
 a


small
 check
 out
 of
 a
 portfolio.
 You're


completely
 concentrated.
 There's
 no


diversification.
 You
 not
 only
 you're


investing
 your
 money,
 you're
 investing


your
 time.
 The
 the
 scarcest
 resource
 you


can
 possibly
 have,
 it
 is
 your
 time
 and


your
 energy
 and
 your
 focus.
 And
 so
 the


the
 entrepreneurs
 investment
 decision
 is


the
 ultimate
 investment
 decision.
 And


once
 you
 make
 it,
 you
 might
 be
 doing


this
 for
 10
 20
 years.
 So
 um
 so
 so


finding
 an
 attractive
 large
 market
 was
 a


key
 question.
 Um
 is
 this
 the
 right
 team


and
 what
 does
 it
 require
 to
 be
 able
 to


execute
 this
 strategy?
 That's
 something


that
 the
 investor
 has
 to
 be
 answering


actively
 and
 the
 entrepreneur
 has
 to
 be


answering
 actively.
 uh
 obviously
 then


there's
 a
 number
 of
 questions
 around
 the


financial
 model
 unit
 economics


uh
 ability
 to
 win
 comote
 that
 the


investor
 has
 to
 answer
 and
 the


entrepreneur
 has
 to
 be
 actually


answering.
 So
 I
 find
 that
 there
 is
 a
 lot


of
 similarities
 in
 some
 of the
 questions


that
 the
 investor
 has
 to
 be
 asking
 and


the
 entrepreneur
 has
 to
 be
 asking


continuously.


What's
 the
 corporate
 culture
 at
 New
 Bank


now?
 What
 is
 it
 like?
 I
 think
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 culture
 that
 uh
 is
 still
 very


much
 energized
 by
 by
 the
 by
 the
 purpose


that
 we
 have
 as
 an
 organization
 by
 the


mission
 that
 we
 have
 about
 uh
 bringing


this
 financial
 inclusion
 and
 financial


competition
 to
 the
 next
 hundreds
 of


millions
 of
 customers
 around
 the
 world.


We
 are
 very
 energized
 by
 by
 what
 this


means
 in
 terms
 of
 disruption
 possibility


uh
 the
 fact
 that
 it's
 still
 not
 visible


for
 most
 investors
 how
 this
 very
 big


market
 is
 about
 to
 change
 and
 we
 can
 be


one
 of
 those
 catalysts
 for
 that
 change


globally.
 So,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


company
 culture
 that
 is
 very
 driven
 by


that
 mission
 um
 of
 people
 that
 are
 that


are
 great
 team
 players
 that
 look
 to
 work


with
 people
 that
 are
 very
 different
 from


them
 that
 are
 all
 about
 the
 team


winning.
 It's
 not
 about
 individual


success,
 but
 it's
 about
 team
 success.
 Uh


is
 very
 horizontally
 na
 in
 nature,
 very


agile.
 It's
 a
 culture
 that
 where
 we


truly
 try
 to
 create
 an
 environment
 of


intellectual
 honesty
 and
 debate
 where
 we


love
 different
 people
 uh
 bringing


different
 ideas
 and
 and
 having
 these


clash
 of
 ideas
 where
 the
 best
 idea
 wins


irrespective
 of
 the
 title
 or
 of
 the
 ego


or
 how
 long
 I've
 been
 here
 or
 whether


I'm
 an
 engineer
 or
 an
 analyst.
 uh
 we
 we


we
 we
 try
 to
 ultimately
 uh
 create
 this


this
 diversity
 of
 point
 of
 views
 and
 let


let
 that
 uh
 operate
 is
 a
 culture
 of
 a


lot
 of
 frugality.
 We
 are
 we
 like
 to
 be


very
 efficient
 with
 the
 resources
 that


we
 have.
 Be
 it
 people,
 energy,
 focus.
 We


like
 to
 try
 to
 do
 few
 things
 but
 do
 them


very
 very
 well
 versus
 being
 spread
 too


thin
 across
 doing
 a
 number
 of
 different


countries
 and
 a
 number
 of
 different


things.
 Um
 and
 um
 and
 I
 would
 say
 at
 the


end
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 people
 that
 work
 like


to
 work
 really
 hard
 and
 that
 bring
 their


their
 you
 know
 their
 their
 entire
 a
 lot


of
 energy
 into
 the
 organization
 and
 and


like
 to
 be
 all
 in
 like
 to
 be
 part
 of


this
 big
 big
 mission.


So
 these
 are
 all
 uh
 uh
 uh
 great
 things


and
 often
 part
 of
 a
 young
 small
 company


startup
 but
 these
 are
 difficult
 values


to
 keep
 over
 time
 right
 so
 how
 do
 you
 do


that?


Yeah
 you're
 you're
 you're
 totally
 right.


I
 always
 tell
 the
 story
 that
 the
 best


interview
 filter
 for
 these
 values
 was


our
 first
 office
 which
 was
 this
 very


crappy
 house
 in
 Brazil
 in
 S.
 Paulo
 where


people
 would
 ring
 the
 bell
 and
 they


would
 see
 this
 house
 and
 two
 there
 were


two
 possible
 responses.
 One
 would
 be
 the


the
 nice
 person
 with
 their
 nice
 suit
 and


tie
 and
 they
 would
 look
 at
 this
 house


and
 they
 would
 say
 these
 guys
 are
 crazy.


What
 do
 you
 mean
 you're
 competing
 with


the
 biggest
 banks
 in
 Brazil?
 I'm
 out
 of


here.
 And
 then
 there
 was
 a
 second
 type


of
 people
 that
 would
 go
 in
 and
 they


would
 sit
 on
 the
 floor
 and
 they
 would


see
 this
 dog
 coming
 around
 and
 we
 would


tell
 them
 the
 mission
 that
 we
 had
 and


they
 would
 say,
 "I
 love
 it.
 I
 mean,
 I'm


here
 on
 Monday."
 So
 that
 that


experience,
 that
 interview
 was
 a
 filter


for
 the
 right
 type
 of
 DNA.


But
 you
 don't
 have
 that
 filter
 anymore


because
 you
 got
 a
 nice
 headquarter.
 You


haven't
 got
 any
 dogs
 running
 around


biting
 them.


We
 still
 have
 the
 dogs,
 but
 we
 have
 a


nice
 headquarter.
 We
 now
 have
 a
 brand.


We're
 a
 public
 company.
 So
 it's
 harder.


it's
 harder
 to
 filter
 for
 that
 DNA.
 And


so
 how
 do
 we
 do
 it?
 Uh
 we
 first
 there's


an
 interview
 process
 where
 we
 try
 to


assess
 uh
 finding
 the
 the
 what
 we
 call


the
 missionaries
 not
 the
 mercenaries.
 We


try
 to
 look
 for
 people
 that
 see


themselves
 as
 that
 have
 high
 amount
 of


agency
 that
 are
 problem
 solvers
 which


means
 they
 are
 attracted
 by
 the
 mission.


They're
 not
 necessarily
 attracted
 by
 the


paycheck.
 That
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 we
 pay


well.
 We
 we
 think
 people
 should
 we


should
 pay
 enough
 so
 that
 compensation


is
 not
 an
 issue
 on
 the
 table
 and
 then


people
 can
 focus
 fully
 on
 the
 on
 the
 on


the
 mission
 but
 they're
 not
 necessarily


we're
 not
 the
 highest
 they're
 not


attracted
 necessarily
 by
 those
 monetary


rewards
 attracted
 by
 the
 the
 the


missions
 the
 purpose
 and
 being
 and


working
 with
 great
 uh
 people
 once
 they


pass
 that
 u
 the
 recruiting
 process
 we


spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 talking
 about
 these


cultural
 values
 one
 thing
 that
 I


continue
 to
 do
 that
 I've
 done
 every


single
 month
 since
 April


2023


2013
 when
 we
 started
 the
 business
 so


over
 12
 years
 is
 I
 do
 a
 culture


presentation
 for
 100%
 of
 the
 people
 that


begin
 at
 new
 bank
 where
 I
 talked
 about


our
 cultural
 values
 and
 this
 is


something
 I
 don't
 delegate
 it's
 a
 way


for
 us
 to
 leave
 the
 values
 as
 I
 spend


the
 time
 discussing
 with
 people
 what


they
 really
 mean
 and
 and and
 try
 to


answer
 all
 the
 questions
 and
 then
 we
 do


our
 performance
 management
 very
 much


aligned
 to
 people
 showing
 these
 cultural


values
 um
 and
 So
 perform


if
 you
 were
 to
 in
 three
 words
 what what


would
 these
 cultural
 values
 be?


I
 think
 this
 consumer
 obsession
 is


people
 that
 are
 truly
 putting
 customer


first
 and
 they're
 creating
 products
 for


consumer
 obsession
 is
 that
 we're
 owners


not
 renters
 is
 this
 point
 about
 having


high
 agency
 and
 and
 not
 just
 blaming
 and


having
 this
 victim
 mentality.
 We're


smart
 efficient.
 So
 it's
 people
 that


show
 that
 they
 can
 create
 product
 and


value
 efficiently.
 We
 have
 to
 be


efficient
 so
 that
 we
 can
 pass
 the


efficiency
 to
 our
 end
 customer
 by


charging
 less
 and
 less
 and
 less.
 So
 we


have
 to
 be
 frugal.
 That's
 that's
 the


frugality
 aspect.
 I
 mean
 we
 build
 strong


and
 diverse
 teams.
 This
 is
 that
 value


that
 I
 was
 referring
 to
 of
 of
 we
 like


bringing
 diverse
 people
 that
 come
 from


diverse
 backgrounds
 and
 they
 can
 work
 in


teams
 and
 debate
 uh
 actively.
 We're


hungry
 and
 challenge
 the
 status
 quo.


There's
 this
 vision
 around
 we
 bring


people
 that
 have
 high
 ambitions
 uh
 and


they
 are
 uh
 they
 like
 to
 challenge
 that


internal
 and
 status
 quo
 and
 external


status
 quo
 as
 we
 build
 new
 products.


What
 keeps
 you
 going?


I
 think
 it's
 this
 purpose.
 Uh
 um
 it's


been
 exciting
 to
 build
 the
 story
 for
 12


years.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think
 the
 challenge
 of


now
 taking
 this
 to
 more
 countries
 is


going
 to
 be
 really
 exciting
 for
 me


personally.
 the
 fact
 that
 there
 are
 so


few
 maybe
 really
 very
 few
 Latin
 American


companies
 or
 Brazilian
 companies
 playing


at
 the
 world
 stage
 and
 that
 we
 have
 the


opportunity
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 few
 ones


ever
 gets
 me
 really
 exciting
 uh
 and
 the


possibility
 to
 show
 that
 we
 can
 play
 at


the
 the
 at
 a
 world
 class
 in
 in
 competing


with
 some
 of
 these
 bigger
 companies


around
 the
 world
 gets
 me
 very
 exciting


and
 um
 and
 the
 innovation
 aspect
 of
 it


is
 is
 this
 this
 question
 around


financial
 inclusion
 advice
 and
 how
 we


can
 use
 uh
 our
 product
 and
 our
 people


and
 culture
 to
 reinvent
 an
 entire


market.
 The
 the
 the
 the


challenge
 and
 and
 difficulty
 of
 that


it's
 it's
 something
 that
 gets
 me
 going


every
 single
 day.


So,
 David,
 you
 said
 you
 had
 um
 uh
 sat


around
 the
 the
 dinner
 table
 and
 your


father
 said
 you
 had
 to
 go
 out
 and
 be
 an


entrepreneur.
 I
 mean,
 you
 kind
 of
 overd


delivered
 a
 bit
 on
 that
 one.
 No.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 I'm
 I'm
 happy
 that


my
 parents
 are
 now
 customers.
 uh
 because


for
 a
 very
 long
 time
 they
 couldn't


really
 understand
 what
 I
 was
 doing.
 They


didn't
 understand
 uh
 they're
 not
 in


Brazil
 and
 and
 they
 were
 not
 able
 to


understand
 what
 a
 bank
 without
 branches


really
 meant.
 Now
 their
 customer
 now


they
 use
 their
 products
 but
 yeah
 I
 think


they
 uh
 that
 we
 we
 we've
 delivered
 that


for
 now.


That's
 good.
 How
 do
 you
 uh
 when
 do
 you


wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning?


I'm
 a
 very
 early
 bird.
 Uh
 I
 like
 waking


up
 around
 5.
 Uh,
 I
 like
 exercising
 every


morning
 and
 then
 I
 like
 a
 couple
 hours


in
 the
 morning
 to
 have
 no
 meetings
 so
 I


can
 really
 focus
 on
 on
 on
 on


distractions
 on
 some
 of
 the
 big


questions
 that
 we
 have.
 Uh,
 but
 it
 also


means
 that
 I
 get
 really
 tired
 very


early.
 I'm
 really
 bad
 at
 dinners.
 I
 go


to
 bed
 very
 early.
 I'm
 in
 bed
 by
 8:30
 or


9.


They
 really
 like
 to
 get
 those
 eight


hours
 of
 sleep.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 work


well
 if
 I
 don't
 get
 seven
 to
 eight
 hours


of
 sleep.


And
 I
 have
 five
 kids,
 so
 I
 love
 spending


time
 with
 them.
 I
 have
 breakfast
 with


them
 every
 morning.
 I
 have
 dinner
 with


them
 every
 night.
 Put
 them
 to
 bed
 every


night
 if
 I'm
 not
 traveling.
 That
 part
 of


of
 of
 family
 and
 kids,
 it's
 super


important
 for
 me.


Why
 is
 uh
 philanthropy
 important
 for


you?
 Because
 you
 and
 you
 and
 Mariel
 have


signed
 the
 giving
 pledge.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 we
 come
 from
 a
 region
 in


the
 world


from
 Colombia.
 uh
 Marielle
 my
 wife
 from


Peru
 where
 there
 is
 just
 a
 lot
 of


poverty
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 don't


have
 access
 to
 opportunities
 and
 we
 were


very
 lucky
 we
 we
 had
 we
 were
 lucky
 to


get
 a
 lot
 of
 opportunities
 being
 an


environment
 where
 our
 parents
 they
 were


not
 necessarily
 rich
 parents
 but
 they


put
 us
 through
 a
 lot
 of
 hard
 work
 into


good
 universities
 and
 and
 open
 a
 lot
 of


door
 for
 us
 and
 we've
 been
 able
 to


create
 an
 a
 company
 that
 has
 enabled
 the


creation
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 wealth
 and
 but
 when


we
 look
 around
 we
 see
 still
 a
 lot
 of


lack
 of
 people
 lacking
 a
 lot
 of


opportunity.
 So
 I
 think
 we
 um
 we
 feel


almost
 like
 a
 moral
 duty
 to
 use
 a
 lot
 of


that
 wealth
 to
 reinvest
 it
 back
 into


society
 and
 giving
 people
 the


opportunities
 that
 we
 also
 had.
 We
 think


that
 we're
 able
 to
 do
 that.
 Not
 only


it's
 a
 good
 it's
 there
 is
 some
 level
 of


ethics
 or
 morality
 that
 is
 good
 for


society
 but
 we
 also
 think
 it's
 smart


because
 we
 think
 that
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


risks
 that
 societies
 such
 as
 ours
 have


is
 that
 there
 is
 so
 much
 wealth


inequality
 that
 if
 it
 be
 it
 continues
 to


go
 in
 this
 direction
 this
 society
 will


become
 unsustainable.
 There
 will
 be
 a


there
 will
 be
 a
 protest.
 There
 will
 be
 a


revolution.
 And
 when
 we
 can
 work
 through


the
 capitalist
 system
 in
 a
 system
 where


the
 money
 that
 gets
 created
 gets


reinvested
 back
 into
 the
 society
 and


enables
 our
 people
 to
 also
 create
 wealth


then
 it's
 a
 much
 more
 self-
 sustaining


cycle
 versus
 a
 cycle
 that
 ends
 by


massive
 accumulation.
 Both
 are


capitalist
 system.
 We
 just
 think
 that


the
 first
 capital
 system
 that
 enables
 re


reinvestment
 of
 wealth
 from
 successful


entrepreneurs
 will
 be
 a
 longlasting
 uh


uh
 better
 type
 of
 cycle.
 So
 from
 a


thinking
 more
 of
 a
 society
 nature,
 we


think
 that
 makes
 sense.
 And
 ultimately


we
 also
 kind
 of
 have
 a
 sense
 that
 we're


not
 going
 to
 take
 this
 wealth
 anywhere


else.
 We're
 all
 going
 to
 die
 at
 some


point.
 There's
 going to
 be
 an
 end.
 And


we
 also
 don't
 necessarily
 think
 the


right
 thing
 is
 to
 give
 all
 this
 wealth


to
 to
 our
 kids.
 We
 want
 to
 love
 them
 a


lot.
 We
 want
 to
 give
 them
 a
 lot
 of


opportunities
 but
 uh
 we
 want
 to
 also
 let


them
 struggle
 and
 let
 them
 help
 them


create
 their
 own
 life
 story
 and
 their


own
 journey
 and
 and
 I
 think
 wealth
 can


help
 a
 little
 bit
 but
 then
 ultimately


can
 also
 uh
 be
 a
 a
 detractor
 to
 that.
 So


and
 as
 an
 extension
 of
 that
 um
 what


would
 be
 your
 advice
 to
 the
 young
 people


listening
 to
 this?
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 one


of the
 things
 that
 made
 me
 really
 proud


of
 of
 this
 giving
 pledge
 and
 I'
 I've


always
 told
 it
 is
 the
 day
 we
 announced


as
 as
 uh
 we
 were
 signing
 the
 the
 giving


pledge.
 The
 amount
 of
 emails
 that
 I
 got


from
 entrepreneurs
 in
 Latin
 America


saying
 one
 day
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 also
 in


that
 list
 was
 amazing
 because
 if
 you


think
 about
 it
 in
 one
 vision
 of


capitalism
 goal
 is
 to
 be
 in
 Forbes
 500.


In
 this
 new
 version
 of
 capitalism
 goal


is
 to
 be
 in
 giving
 pledge.
 In
 one
 you


accumulate,
 in
 the
 other
 one
 you


accumulate
 but
 then
 you
 give
 back.
 And


so
 uh
 I
 think
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 the


beginning
 of
 seeing
 a
 new
 generation
 of


entrepreneurs
 that
 are
 more
 tune
 in
 with


some
 of
 the
 needs
 of
 of
 of
 of
 this


society
 especially
 in
 emerging
 markets


in
 Brazil
 again
 where
 there
 is
 so
 much


such
 a
 such
 lack
 of
 access
 and
 um
 and


and
 I
 think
 that
 would
 be
 my
 advice
 and


I
 think
 people
 are
 very
 motivated.
 I
 see


a
 new
 generation
 that
 is
 that
 of
 course


creating
 wealth
 is
 great.
 There's


nothing
 wrong
 with
 that
 and
 and
 and


allowing
 their
 families
 to
 to
 live
 a


good
 life
 is
 great
 but
 then
 also
 give


that
 back
 and
 and
 create
 opportunities


for
 other
 ones
 so
 that
 the
 that
 the
 that


the
 the
 circle
 continues
 for
 a
 very
 long


time.


David,
 this
 has
 been
 tremendous
 uh
 big


congratulations
 on
 uh
 on
 what
 you
 have


achieved.
 It's
 uh
 just
 really


outstanding
 and
 thanks
 for
 taking
 the


time
 today.


Nikolai,
 it's
 been
 a
 pleasure.
 Thank
 you


so
 much
 for
 many
 great
 questions.
 Love


the
 conversation.
