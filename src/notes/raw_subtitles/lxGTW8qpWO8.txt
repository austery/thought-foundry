There
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 called


Perplexity
 the
 Google
 killer
 three
 years


ago.
 Fast
 forward
 to
 now,
 Google
 search


is
 doing
 just
 fine.
 The
 core
 problem


that
 Perplexity
 faces
 is
 that
 they
 built


a
 Ferrari
 for
 a
 world
 that
 needs


Corollas.
 The
 math,
 the
 engine


economics,
 and
 even
 Google's
 antitrust


ruling
 all
 point
 to
 the
 same
 thing.


Perplexity
 still
 cannot
 beat
 Google


search.
 Let's
 break
 down
 why.
 Episode
 7


of
 my
 series
 AI
 hype
 versus
 reality.


Let's
 go.
 Just
 two
 years
 ago,
 Perplexity


AI
 processed
 42
 million
 queries
 per


month
 on
 average.
 And
 by
 October
 of
 the


following
 year,
 the
 number
 grew
 to
 400


million,
 a
 thousand%
 growth
 in
 under
 a


year.
 A
 very
 solid
 number,
 solid,
 but


microscopic
 compared
 to
 Google's
 8.5


billion
 queries
 per
 day.
 These
 numbers


for
 a
 startup
 that
 managed
 to
 make


headlines
 as
 a
 potential
 Google
 rival,


something
 nobody
 has
 done
 in
 decades,
 is


phenomenal.
 But
 there
 is
 a
 fundamental


difference.
 an
 enormous
 scale
 gap


between
 the
 economics
 of
 AI
 native


search
 and
 an
 adfunded
 search.
 This


isn't
 even
 apples
 and
 oranges.
 This
 is


apples
 and
 an
 entire
 orchard.
 What
 do
 we


need
 to
 know
 about
 AI
 native
 search
 and


an
 adfunded
 search?
 Let's
 talk
 about


Google.
 Google's
 advertising
 revenue


reached
 $237


billion,
 which
 is
 a
 6%
 Y
 increase,
 which


is
 the
 second
 smallest
 growth
 rate
 in


two
 decades.
 Once
 again,
 almost
 $240


billion
 is
 their
 second
 smallest
 growth


rate
 in
 two
 decades.
 In
 2025,
 this
 ad


revenue
 went
 up
 to
 almost
 $300
 billion.


Ads
 are
 a
 gigantic
 revenue
 stream
 for


Google.
 It
 makes
 up
 77%
 of
 Alphabet's


total
 revenue
 and
 translates
 to


approximately
 $700
 million
 earned
 daily


from
 advertising
 alone.
 Combine
 that


with
 YouTube
 ads
 and
 Google
 network
 and


you'll
 realize
 that
 search
 ads
 aren't
 a


side
 business
 for
 Google.
 They
 are
 the


business.
 Now,
 let's
 talk
 about


Perplexity.
 Perplexity
 doesn't
 have
 any


of
 this
 infrastructure.
 Perplexity's


annual
 projected
 revenue
 for
 this
 year


is
 147
 million.
 Compare
 that
 to
 Google's


daily
 revenue
 of
 780
 from
 advertising


alone.
 Perplexity's
 active
 user
 base
 is


estimated
 at
 25
 million
 users,


generating
 780
 million
 monthly
 queries


as
 of
 today.
 It
 is
 estimated
 that
 the


revenue
 that
 Perplexity
 makes
 per
 each


user
 is
 $4.50


annually.
 Google's
 estimated
 revenue
 per


user
 per
 year
 is
 $80
 globally.
 It
 is


higher
 in
 North
 America,
 but
 on
 average


is
 $80.
 Now,
 let's
 talk
 about
 the


mechanism
 of
 search.
 At
 Google,
 it's


keyword
 matching.
 At
 Perplexity,
 it's


neural
 information
 retrieval
 plus
 LLM.


Perplexity's
 conversational
 interface


requires
 significantly
 higher


computational
 costs
 than
 Google's


traditional
 keyword
 matching
 because
 for


each
 response,
 Perplexity's
 AI
 search


combines
 LLM
 with
 realtime
 synthesis


from
 multiple
 sources,
 whereas
 Google


simply
 retrieves
 the
 link.
 Now,
 let's


talk
 about
 the
 unit
 economics
 of
 an
 AI


search
 versus
 adb-based
 search.
 If
 we


factor
 in
 Perplexity's
 infrastructure


costs
 for
 processing
 natural
 language


queries
 and
 generating
 cited
 responses


and
 pair
 it
 up
 with
 their
 clean
 and


beautiful
 UX,
 there
 is
 little
 to
 no
 room


for
 advertising.
 In
 contrast,
 Google's


seamless
 ad
 placement
 within
 search


results
 generates
 a
 ton
 of
 money
 for


them
 automatically.
 Perplexity
 is


currently
 valued
 at
 $18
 billion,
 and


that's
 a
 double
 of
 their
 valuation
 since


December
 2024.
 And
 it
 does
 show
 investor


confidence
 in
 long-term
 disruption


potential.
 But
 current
 perplexities


revenue
 would
 have
 to
 grow
 2500
 times
 to


match
 Google's
 advertising
 revenue


alone.
 That
 is
 the
 cost
 of
 scale
 for
 an


AI
 first
 search
 versus
 traditional


search.
 Chrome's
 dominance
 gives
 Google


such
 a
 massive
 distribution
 advantage


that
 it
 dictates
 the
 search
 behavior


that
 we
 as
 users
 adopt
 and
 it
 makes
 it


brutally
 difficult
 for
 competitors
 like


Perplexity
 to
 win
 those
 users.
 Chrome's


dominance
 is
 more
 than
 just
 a
 market


share.
 It
 allows
 Google
 to
 integrate


search
 directly
 into
 the
 browsing


experience.
 And
 the
 browsing
 experience


is
 such
 that
 the
 address
 bar
 doubles
 as


the
 search
 interface.
 And
 when
 you
 open


a
 new
 page,
 you
 get
 all
 of
 the
 Google


services
 at
 once.
 They
 deliberately


integrate
 Chrome
 with
 the
 rest
 of


Google's
 ecosystem.
 So
 much
 so
 that
 even


superior
 AI
 search
 must
 overcome


ingrained
 user
 habits.
 And
 as
 you
 know,


old
 habits
 die
 hard.
 Perplexity,
 on
 the


other
 hand,
 is
 well
 aware
 of
 its
 weak


modes.
 Perplexity
 does
 not
 have
 its
 own


proprietary
 database
 of
 web
 pages
 like


traditional
 search
 engines.
 Only
 about


half
 of
 its
 users
 pay
 for
 the
 pro
 plan,


and
 50%
 of
 the
 paid
 users
 either
 come


from
 trials,
 promotions,
 referrals,
 or


bundles.
 Meaning,
 Perplexity
 doesn't
 get


the
 full
 revenue
 out
 of
 those
 subs.
 That


fragility
 explains
 why
 Perplexity
 team


keeps
 experimenting.
 They
 introduced


this
 feature
 called
 pages.
 They
 just


launched
 their
 own
 browser
 extension
 and


they
 even
 bid
 to
 buy
 Google
 Chrome.
 Keep


watching
 till
 the
 end
 to
 find
 out
 what


happened.
 Now,
 a
 few
 words
 on


Perplexity's
 browser.
 On
 one
 hand,
 you


may
 argue
 that
 Chrome's
 dominance
 is
 so


entrenched
 that
 nobody
 can
 seriously


erode
 it.
 But
 Perplexities
 got
 quite
 a


bit
 of
 an
 advantage.
 A
 fairy
 godmother,


if
 I
 may,
 the
 one
 and
 only
 Chad
 GPT.
 And


you
 guys
 know
 why
 Chad
 GPT
 was
 the


product
 that
 changed
 the
 search


behavior.
 A
 shift
 that
 nobody
 was
 able


to
 pull
 off
 in
 decades.
 The
 thing
 is


that
 traditional
 search
 began
 as
 a
 way


to
 return
 lists
 of
 sites.
 Over
 time,


they
 layered
 on
 extensions,
 widgets,


services,
 shopping,
 booking,
 knowledge


panels,
 and
 all
 of
 them
 were
 designed
 to


cut
 down
 the
 user's
 path
 from
 query
 to


solution.
 But
 chat
 GPT
 has
 removed
 the


need
 for
 the
 user
 path
 entirely.
 Large


language
 models
 began
 producing
 answers


right
 away
 and
 that
 opened
 our
 eyes
 on
 a


completely
 different
 search
 behavior.


People
 realized
 that
 they
 no
 longer
 have


to
 look
 for
 the
 information
 or
 for
 the


answer.
 They
 could
 get
 instant
 answers


without
 clicking
 at
 all.
 But
 LLMs
 come


with
 three
 unavoidable
 flaws.
 They


hallucinate.
 Their
 stored
 knowledge


capacity
 is
 limited.
 And
 they're
 not


trained
 on
 the
 most
 up-to-date


information.
 So
 what
 Perplexity
 and


products
 like
 Perplexity
 did
 is
 that


they
 married
 the
 relevance
 of
 the


information
 on
 Google
 to
 LLM
 behavior.


What
 they
 did
 is
 they
 built
 a


conversational
 search
 with
 beautiful
 UX.


By
 the
 way,
 they
 were
 one
 of
 the
 first


AI
 apps
 to
 demonstrate
 how
 LLMs
 do


reasoning,
 which
 planted
 that


credibility
 in
 our
 eyes
 because
 it


looked
 like
 Perplexity
 was
 thinking.
 And


all
 of
 that
 was
 paired
 with
 very
 recent


news
 and
 the
 most
 up-to-date


information.
 Now,
 Plexity
 does


hallucinate
 every
 now
 and
 then,
 but
 the


UX
 of
 the
 app
 almost
 made
 it
 seem
 like


it
 doesn't.
 So,
 why
 didn't
 the
 Google


killer
 moment
 actually
 happen?
 It
 didn't


happen
 because
 not
 all
 searches
 are
 made


with
 the
 same
 purpose.
 What
 we
 love


doing
 in
 this
 channel
 is
 playing
 product


management
 101.
 So,
 let's
 do
 it
 again.


Why
 do
 people
 search
 in
 the
 first
 place?


There
 are
 two
 primary
 buckets
 of
 search


queries.
 The
 first
 one
 is
 to
 get
 direct


answers.
 What's
 tomorrow's
 weather?
 Who


won
 the
 game?
 What's
 the
 meaning
 of
 this


word?
 For
 these
 questions,
 Google
 is
 an


obvious
 choice
 because
 it's
 simply


faster.
 Now,
 if
 you
 plug
 any
 of
 those


questions
 into
 Perplexity,
 it'll
 start


fetching
 data,
 comparing
 sources,
 giving


you
 pros
 and
 cons,
 summarizing


trade-offs,
 etc.
 Whereas,
 Google
 just


serves
 the
 result.
 And
 the
 second
 bucket


is
 when
 people
 are
 working
 on
 a
 task
 or


on
 a
 question
 that
 has
 causal


relationship
 when
 they're
 doing


research.
 In
 other
 words,
 when
 the


question
 isn't
 a
 yes
 or
 no.
 In
 this


case,
 a
 user
 wants
 a
 completely
 opposite


behavior.
 They
 don't
 want
 generic


summarization
 or
 a
 one-word
 answer.
 If


anything,
 they
 get
 irritated
 when
 a


complex
 question
 gets
 answered
 with
 one


word.
 And
 the
 problem
 is
 that
 perplexity


covers
 only
 one
 of
 these
 use
 cases,
 the


second
 one.
 It
 also
 doesn't
 support
 any


of
 the
 service
 requests.
 It
 can't
 make
 a


reservation.
 It
 can't
 make
 a
 call.
 It


can't
 book
 a
 service.
 Sequia
 was
 blunt


about
 this.
 The
 Genai
 agent
 market
 is


effectively
 a
 services
 market.
 And
 if


you
 want
 to
 beat
 Google,
 you
 can't
 stop


at
 information.
 You
 must
 provide
 a
 full


service
 of
 a
 search
 engine,
 quick


answers,
 and
 research
 and
 services.


Perplexity's
 native
 browser
 removes
 a


reliance
 on
 someone
 else's
 platform
 and


gives
 them
 a
 competitive
 edge
 that
 it


lacks.
 Because
 users
 are
 already
 logged


in,
 the
 experience
 is
 personalized.
 And


most
 importantly,
 the
 browser
 becomes


the
 single
 front
 door
 for
 every
 type
 of


query
 from
 a
 basic
 question
 to
 complex


tasks.
 That
 is
 something
 Google
 is
 boxed


out
 of.
 Chrome
 is
 structured
 around
 the


search
 bar
 which
 is
 structured
 around


the
 search
 ads.
 Building
 an
 AI
 first


browser
 that
 simply
 provides
 answers


would
 cannibalize
 the
 very
 revenue


stream
 that
 Chrome
 is
 designed
 to


protect.
 Perplexity
 comment
 browser
 just


came
 out
 recently.
 And
 if
 you've
 had
 a


chance
 to
 test
 it
 out,
 please
 do
 let
 me


know
 what
 you
 guys
 think
 about
 it
 in
 the


comments.
 I'm
 really
 looking
 forward
 to


seeing
 Perplexity's
 end
 ofear
 results


after
 this
 launch.
 But
 nevertheless,
 on


pure
 economics,
 Perplexity
 doesn't
 stand


a
 chance
 against
 Google.
 But
 business


isn't
 just
 about
 economics.
 It's
 also


about
 politics
 and
 law.
 And
 who
 doesn't


love
 a
 good
 old
 plot
 twist.
 Let's
 talk


about
 what's
 hot
 off
 the
 press.
 Google's


antitrust
 ruling.
 The
 US
 Department
 of


Justice
 has
 been
 pursuing
 antitrust


lawsuits
 against
 Google.
 As
 a
 quick
 side


note,
 antitrust
 laws
 are
 meant
 to


protect
 competition
 and
 commerce.
 In
 the


US,
 it
 is
 not
 illegal
 to
 be
 big
 and


powerful.
 There
 is
 absolutely
 nothing


wrong
 with
 gaining
 monopoly
 position


from
 superior
 products
 or
 services.


However,
 what
 is
 illegal
 is
 when
 a


monopoly
 takes
 predatory
 steps
 to
 stop


its
 rivals.
 The
 antitrust
 lawsuit


against
 Google
 is
 focused
 on
 two
 main


areas.
 The
 first
 one
 being
 that
 Google


has
 an
 illegal
 monopoly
 in
 the
 general


search
 and
 search
 advertising
 market.


The
 second
 one
 around
 Google
 being
 a


monopoly
 in
 online
 advertising


technology.
 In
 2024,
 Google
 lost
 the


biggest
 antitrust
 challenge
 when
 the


judge
 Amit
 Makda
 found
 that
 it
 illegally


monopolized
 the
 search
 market.
 And
 this


month,
 the
 US
 government
 has
 ordered


Google
 to
 sell
 its
 Chrome
 web
 browser


and
 license
 search
 data
 to
 competitors.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 this
 would
 mark
 the


biggest
 forced
 breakup
 of
 a
 US
 company


since
 AT&T
 was
 dismantled
 in
 1984.
 So,


who
 do
 you
 think
 expressed
 interest
 in


purchasing
 Google
 Chrome?
 You
 guessed


it,
 Perplexity
 and
 OpenAI.
 The
 Justice


Department
 said
 that
 Google,
 whose


search
 engine
 controls
 nearly
 90%
 of


online
 queries,
 has
 paid
 around
 $26


billion
 to
 maintain
 a
 monopoly
 over
 the


search
 market
 by
 agreements
 with
 tech


rivals,
 smartphone
 manufacturers,
 and


wireless
 providers.
 In
 exchange
 for
 a


cut
 of
 advertising
 revenue,
 those


companies,
 including
 Apple
 and
 Samsung,


agreed
 to
 set
 Google
 as
 the
 default
 on


browser
 and
 mobile
 devices.
 Google


illegally
 monopolized
 the
 market
 for


general
 search
 and
 search
 text


advertising.
 the
 ads
 that
 appear
 at
 the


top
 of
 the
 search
 results
 page.
 So,
 what


happens
 now?
 The
 judge
 proposed
 the


following.
 A
 forced
 sale
 of
 Google


Chrome,
 like
 I
 mentioned
 before,


prohibit
 Google
 from
 entering
 into
 any


kind
 of
 exclusive
 deals.
 And
 for
 its


existing
 agreements,
 Google
 would
 be


required
 to
 offer
 smartphone
 makers
 and


wireless
 carriers
 the
 option
 to
 display


a
 choice
 screens
 to
 users.
 Now,
 how
 did


Google
 respond?
 Google
 said
 that
 it


intends
 to
 appeal
 the
 judge's
 ruling


that
 it
 has
 illegally
 monopolized
 the


search
 market,
 which
 could
 delay
 a


remedy
 for
 months
 or
 even
 years.
 Google


also
 said
 that
 it
 plans
 to
 challenge
 any


ruling
 that
 calls
 for
 Chrome
 to
 be


divested
 and
 also
 proposed
 a
 counter
 set


of
 remedies
 that
 would
 modify
 its


default
 search
 agreements
 with
 Apple
 and


Mozilla.
 It
 also
 said
 that
 it
 would
 make


it
 easier
 for
 phone
 makers
 such
 as


Samsung
 to
 use
 its
 Android
 operating


system
 without
 having
 to
 make
 Google


search
 the
 default
 on
 the
 devices.
 Now,


what
 did
 Perplexity
 offer
 Google?


Perplexity
 made
 an
 audacious
 34.5


billion
 allcash
 offer,
 which
 is
 their


first
 big
 acquisition
 move.
 Now,


personally,
 I
 don't
 think
 it'll
 happen.


But


now,
 did
 I
 think
 there
 would
 be
 an
 M&A


situation
 around
 Perplexity?
 Yes.
 And
 I


was
 hoping
 that
 it
 would
 be
 an
 A


acquisition
 by,
 for
 example,
 Apple,
 and


they
 have
 good
 reasons
 for
 it.
 But
 did
 I


think
 Perplexity
 would
 be
 offered
 by


Google
 Chrome?
 No,
 that
 wasn't
 in
 my


wildest
 dreams.
 Perplexity's
 bid
 was


made
 through
 a
 letter
 to
 Alphabet
 CEO


and
 it
 promises
 to
 contain
 Chrome
 as


open
 source,
 invest
 $3
 billion
 after
 2


years,
 and
 drum
 roll,
 keep
 Google
 as
 the


default
 search
 engine.
 This
 offer
 would


essentially
 allow
 Perplexity
 to
 access


Chrome's
 user
 base,
 3
 million,
 and


transform
 Perplexity's
 engine
 economics


without
 displacing
 Google's
 core
 search


monopoly.
 This
 would
 also
 allow


Perplexity
 to
 gradually
 introduce
 its
 AI


powered
 search
 through
 the
 browser
 while


avoiding
 the
 direct
 confrontation
 that


has
 limited
 other
 Google
 competitors.


The
 industry
 analysts
 are
 very
 skeptical


about
 this
 offer
 and
 deem
 it
 as
 a
 stunt


that
 significantly
 undervalues
 Chrome's


true
 worth.
 Many
 suggest
 that
 the


browser
 could
 be
 worth
 upwards
 of
 $50


billion
 because
 of
 its
 unmatched
 data


collection
 and
 user
 reach.
 Now,
 even
 if


there
 is
 a
 universe
 where
 Perplexity
 can


pull
 this
 off,
 I
 really
 don't
 know
 where


they're
 going
 to
 get
 $34.5


billion
 in
 cash.
 Perplexity's
 valuation


is
 $18
 billion,
 which
 is
 why
 this
 whole


move
 has
 raised
 serious
 question
 about


financial
 ability
 of
 Perplexity
 to
 pull


this
 off.
 And
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 Google


has
 shown
 no
 intention
 to
 sell
 Chrome.


Now,
 the
 interesting
 thing
 is
 that


OpenAI
 and
 Yahoo
 have
 also
 expressed


interest
 in
 Chrome,
 which
 could


potentially
 trigger
 a
 bidding
 war
 that


can
 push
 valuations
 far
 beyond


Perplexity's
 resources.
 But
 let's
 see


what
 happens.
 Conclusion:


Building
 a
 better
 search
 engine
 isn't


the
 hardest
 part.
 Building
 a
 profitable


one
 is.
 Perplexity
 has
 created
 a


beautiful
 and
 extremely
 highquality


product,
 but
 their
 own
 unit
 economics


plays
 against
 them.
 Every
 AI
 powered


response
 costs
 exponentially
 more
 than
 a


keyword
 match.
 And
 no
 amount
 of
 venture


capital
 funding
 changes
 that
 math.


Google's
 monopoly
 isn't
 only
 about


distribution
 and
 data.
 It's
 about
 the


fact
 that
 they
 discovered
 a
 search
 model


that
 actually
 makes
 more
 money
 at
 scale.


And
 this
 is
 why
 Perplexity
 cannot
 beat


Google
 search.
 At least
 not
 today.
 I


hope
 you
 found
 this
 video
 helpful.
 Let


us
 know
 what
 you
 think
 in
 the
 comments.


Till
 next
 time.
 Bye.
