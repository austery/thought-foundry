Welcome
 to
 Marion
 Talks
 Money,
 the


podcast
 in
 which
 people
 who
 know
 the


markets
 explain
 the
 markets.
 I'm
 Marin


Samset
 Webb.
 This
 week
 we
 are
 talking


about
 activist
 investing,
 why
 it's


seeing
 a
 resurgence
 and
 what
 that
 means


for
 the
 investment
 landscape
 and


possibly
 for
 your
 portfolio.
 I'm


speaking
 with
 Joe
 Bowen,
 CEO
 and
 CIO
 at


Asset
 Value
 Investors
 and
 the
 manager
 of


AVI
 Global
 Trust
 as
 well
 as
 AVI
 Japan


Opportunity
 Trust.
 AVI
 Asset
 Value


Investors
 is
 a
 UK-
 based
 active
 investor


open
 to
 private
 investors.
 That
 means


the
 group
 targets
 quality
 companies


trading
 at
 discounts
 often
 family


controlled
 holding
 companies
 and
 tries


to
 unlock
 their
 value
 through
 active


engagement.
 So
 we
 talked
 to
 Joe
 about


the
 strategy
 behind
 AVI
 Global
 Trust,


how
 his
 strategy
 works
 and
 what
 mistakes


he's
 made
 along
 the
 way
 as
 well
 as
 the


opportunities
 he
 now
 sees
 abroad
 in
 both


Japan
 and
 in
 Korea.
 Joe,
 welcome
 to


Marin
 Talks
 Money.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.
 It's
 good
 to
 be


here.
 All
 right.
 I
 know
 you've
 got
 quite


a
 lot
 of
 fans
 among
 our
 audience,
 but


you
 may
 also
 have
 some
 listeners
 with
 us


today
 who
 don't
 know
 much
 about
 you
 and


what
 you
 do.
 So,
 I
 wonder
 if
 you
 could


just
 set
 us
 up
 by
 telling
 us
 about
 how


you
 invest
 and
 why.


>> The
 starting
 point
 for
 everything
 we
 do


at
 AVI
 is
 the
 idea
 that
 stock
 markets


aren't
 always
 efficient.
 We're
 all
 told


that
 stock
 markets
 are
 efficient.


>> Uh,
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 only
 really
 true


about
 certain
 parts
 of
 it.
 typically
 the


largest
 liquid,
 most
 wellressearched
 and


covered
 names.
 Yeah,
 they're
 quite


efficient,
 but
 they're
 always
 parts
 of


the
 stock
 market
 that
 are
 neglected,


overlooked,
 underress
 researched,
 and


that
 gives
 rise
 to
 inefficiencies.
 And


that's
 generally
 the
 parts
 of
 the
 stock


market
 that
 we
 are
 interested.
 And
 on


top
 of
 that,
 we
 particularly
 like
 the


idea
 about
 being
 able
 to
 buy
 into
 good


quality
 businesses
 that
 are
 trading


below
 the
 value
 of
 their
 assets
 or
 their


businesses.
 The
 two
 are
 actually
 linked.


The
 discount
 arises
 simply
 because
 the


fact
 that
 price
 discovery
 isn't
 working.


That
 philosophy
 or
 process
 permeates


everything
 we
 do.
 And
 then
 I
 think
 the


third
 angle
 of
 our
 approach
 is
 it's


great
 to
 buy
 something
 that
 when
 it's


cheap.
 It's
 great
 to
 buy
 good
 business


that
 you
 think
 is
 going
 to
 go
 up
 in


value,
 but
 hope
 is
 not
 a
 strategy.
 And


the
 third
 element
 of
 our
 approach
 really


is
 working
 as
 an
 engaged
 shareholder
 to


try
 and
 address
 and
 remedy
 that


mispricing,
 that
 undervaluation.
 So
 in


some
 cases
 it
 could
 be
 shareholder


activism.
 In
 some
 cases
 it's
 a
 softer


shareholder
 engagement
 process.
 But
 it's


always
 about
 trying
 to
 do
 something
 to


unlock
 value.


Okay,
 so
 here's
 the
 difference.
 If
 I


talk
 to
 any
 fund
 manager
 I
 talk
 to
 is


going
 to
 say
 roughly
 what
 you
 have
 said


to
 me,
 it
 may
 be
 in
 a
 slightly
 different


way.
 They're
 all
 going
 to
 say
 that
 they


are
 finding
 value
 where
 other
 people
 are


not.
 That
 anything
 they
 buy
 is
 going
 to


be
 mispriced
 by
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 market.


That's
 if
 you
 call
 yourself
 growth,
 you


call
 yourself
 value,
 whatever
 you
 call


yourself.
 When
 you
 are
 an
 active


investor
 and
 you
 buy
 a
 share,
 you


believe
 you
 have
 seen
 something
 that
 the


rest
 of
 the
 market
 has
 not
 seen.
 But
 the


difference
 here
 between
 what
 you
 are


saying
 and
 other
 people
 say
 is
 that
 you


are
 attempting
 yourself
 to
 create
 the


catalyst
 to
 bring
 out
 the
 value.


>> There's
 another
 angle
 as
 well
 and
 that


is
 that
 yeah
 of
 course
 every
 analyst,


every
 fund
 manager
 has
 got
 a
 model
 and


they're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 target
 price
 or


target
 valuation.
 What's
 interesting


about
 many
 of
 the
 companies
 that
 we


invest
 in
 is
 that
 they
 own
 assets
 and


businesses
 that
 could
 be
 liquidated


today
 for
 a
 pound
 and
 they're
 trading
 at


60
 70.
 These
 aren't
 blue
 sky
 valuations.


These
 are
 actual
 liquidation
 values.
 And


I
 guess
 the
 most
 extreme
 example
 of
 that


is
 what
 we
 see
 in
 Japan
 and
 have
 seen
 in


Japan
 for
 many
 years.
 And
 that
 is


>> many
 companies
 in
 Japan
 holding
 huge


amounts
 of
 surplus
 net
 cash
 on
 their


balance
 sheets.
 And
 in
 the
 most
 extreme


cases,
 the
 value
 of
 that
 cash
 and


sometimes
 other
 listed
 securities
 is


well
 above
 the
 market
 cap
 of
 the


company.


>> And
 that
 was
 an
 extraordinary
 thing.
 I


mean,
 you'd
 started
 your
 Japan
 only


strategy.
 There
 are
 two
 trusts
 here
 just


for
 those
 who
 who
 don't
 know
 the
 AVI


global
 and
 then
 another
 AVI
 trust
 that


specializes
 in
 Japan.
 You
 started
 that


about
 seven
 years
 ago.
 And
 even
 before


you
 had
 started
 that,
 I
 had
 been
 writing


for
 years
 about
 exactly
 that
 kind
 of


value.
 And
 there
 it
 was.
 There's
 cash.


It's
 just
 sitting
 there.
 These


companies,
 some
 of
 them
 with
 more
 cash


on
 the
 balance
 sheet
 than
 their
 market


capitalization.
 But
 nonetheless,
 year


after
 year,
 the
 market
 simply
 ignored


that.
 And
 then
 something
 changed.


>> That's
 right.
 For
 many
 years,
 the
 mantra


in
 Japan
 was
 we
 need
 to
 have
 cash
 for
 a


rainy
 day.


>> And
 uh
 in
 fact,
 when
 you
 spoke
 to


companies
 in
 Japan,
 it
 became
 clear
 that


that
 they
 were
 told
 employees
 were
 told


that
 if
 a
 shareholder
 asks
 for
 the
 money


back,
 you
 tell
 them
 it
 doesn't
 belong
 to


them,
 it
 belongs
 to
 the
 company.
 You


know,
 a
 very
 subtle
 but
 important


difference.
 But
 all
 of
 it
 changed
 um


around
 10
 years
 ago
 with
 the


introduction
 under
 the
 late
 prime


minister
 Abbe
 of
 the
 corporate


governance
 code
 and
 the
 stewardship
 code


which
 really
 attempted
 to
 change
 the
 the


psychology
 of
 businesses
 of
 companies
 in


Japan
 and
 promote
 the
 interests
 of


shareholders
 which
 for
 so
 long
 had
 been


really
 knocked
 back
 and
 companies
 had


been
 run
 primarily
 for
 employees,


society,
 pensioners
 but
 not
 for


shareholders
 and
 that
 really
 has
 changed


in
 the
 last
 decade.
 It's
 taken
 a
 long


time,
 but
 we're
 seeing
 companies
 focused


a
 lot
 more
 on
 their
 share
 price.
 They


are
 more
 conscious
 of
 capital


efficiency,
 not
 blindly
 accumulating


cash
 and
 doing
 nothing
 with
 it,
 but


buying
 back
 shares,
 investing
 in
 their


business,
 returning
 it
 in
 other
 ways
 to


shareholders.
 We
 see
 many
 companies
 in


Japan,
 they're
 bothered
 today
 about


their
 share
 price.
 They
 want
 to
 know


what
 they
 can
 do
 to
 achieve
 a
 higher


share
 price.
 And
 if
 a
 shareholder
 comes


and
 and
 has
 a
 constructive
 answer
 to


that
 dilemma,
 then
 unlike
 many
 years


ago,
 they
 want
 to
 hear.
 You
 know,
 in
 the


past,
 they
 didn't
 want
 to
 speak
 to
 us,


now
 they
 do.


>> And
 are
 you
 still
 finding
 lots
 of


opportunities
 in
 Japan?
 I
 mean,
 it's


been
 a
 good
 run,
 right?
 And
 your


performance
 has
 been
 extremely
 good
 in


Japan.
 So,
 are
 you
 looking
 around
 now


and
 going
 there,
 well,
 you
 know,
 that


was
 great,
 but
 maybe
 it's
 time
 to
 move


on.


>> Yeah,
 we
 are
 seeing
 many,
 many


opportunities
 today.
 The
 opportunity
 set


has
 evolved.
 Clearly
 the
 extreme


valuations
 we
 identified
 seven
 eight


years
 ago
 have
 moderated
 to
 an
 extent


>> but
 what
 has
 changed
 is
 is
 the
 catalyst.


So
 seven
 or
 eight
 years
 ago
 you
 had
 to


work
 really
 hard
 to
 get
 companies
 to


talk
 to
 you
 to
 listen
 to
 you
 to
 try
 and


do
 some
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we
 were


suggesting.


>> Today
 they
 are
 much
 more
 willing
 and
 the


door
 is
 much
 more
 open
 uh
 than
 it
 was


seven
 or
 eight
 years
 ago.
 So
 in
 that
 in


that
 sense
 there's
 still
 discounted


valuations
 and
 the
 catalyst
 is
 is
 much


more
 likely
 to
 arrive.
 And
 the
 other


change
 that's
 happened
 over
 the
 last


seven
 or
 eight
 years
 is
 the
 presence
 of


private
 equity
 in
 Japan.
 So
 Japan
 has


notoriously
 been
 a
 market
 in
 which


hostile
 takeover
 activity
 hasn't
 worked


where
 companies
 are
 desperate
 to
 stay


listed
 to
 not
 be
 taken
 over
 by
 vultures


particularly
 foreign
 vulture
 private


equity
 funds.
 But
 the
 presence
 of
 of


private
 equity
 has
 been
 growing
 over
 the


last
 seven
 years
 both
 the
 domestic


sector
 and
 also
 the
 global
 sector.
 And


whilst
 we've
 been
 making
 the
 lives
 of


the
 listed
 companies
 a
 little
 bit
 more


challenging
 by
 being
 an
 activist


shareholder,
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 the


table,
 private
 equity
 has
 been
 the
 nice


guy.
 It's
 been
 playing
 golf,
 taking
 them


to
 restaurants
 and
 trying
 to
 tell
 them


that
 life
 as
 a
 private
 company
 could
 be


good
 for
 them,
 could
 be
 good
 for
 our


employees,
 could
 be
 good
 for
 society.


And
 so
 we're
 seeing
 a
 big
 pickup
 and
 the


double
 effect
 I
 suppose
 of
 more
 activist


shareholders,
 more
 willing
 management


teams
 and
 the
 threat
 of
 um
 change
 of


corporate
 control
 is
 really
 driving


leading
 to
 a
 a
 big
 increase
 in
 change
 of


corporate
 control
 uh
 market
 and
 that's


really
 helping
 compress
 the
 discounts.


I'd
 say
 when
 I
 was
 last
 in
 Japan
 about
 a


year
 ago
 and
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 a
 lot
 of


people
 about
 private
 equity
 and
 quite
 a


lot
 of
 the
 private
 equity
 players
 were


finding
 it
 to
 be
 a
 very
 different
 market


to
 the
 one
 they
 were
 used
 to
 and
 much


more
 difficult
 to
 operate
 in.


>> Much
 more
 difficult
 to
 operate
 in.


>> Anecdotally,
 what
 I've
 seen
 is
 there's


still
 a
 resistance
 to
 hostile
 takeover


activity.


>> But
 what's
 helped
 has
 been
 in
 a
 sense


the
 evolution
 of
 activist
 shareholders


on
 registers.
 So
 you
 now
 found
 when
 you


look
 at
 our
 portfolio
 for
 example


there's
 a
 handful
 of
 situations
 where
 30


to
 40%
 of
 the
 shares
 are
 held
 by
 two
 or


three
 different
 activist
 shareholders


and
 that's
 quite
 an
 interesting


development
 from
 private
 equity


perspective
 it
 means
 that
 rather
 than


approach
 a
 company
 not
 having
 any
 shares


not
 having
 any
 support
 on
 the
 register


you
 could
 now
 approach
 a
 company
 with
 30


to
 40%
 support
 and
 you
 could
 say
 this
 is


what
 we
 want
 to
 do
 and
 then
 it
 almost


becomes
 a
 fetto
 complete
 not
 always
 but


it
 makes
 life
 very
 difficult
 for


management
 if
 such
 a
 large
 proportion
 of


their
 register
 want
 to
 see
 some
 kind
 of


change
 of
 corporate
 control.


>> Okay.
 Interesting.
 And
 what
 have
 you


most
 recently
 bought
 in
 Japan?


>> We've
 been
 buying
 Mitsubishi
 Logistics,


which
 is
 a
 a
 a
 very
 large
 logistics


company.
 Very
 very
 interesting
 valuation


in
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 not
 only
 is
 a
 very


profitable
 operating
 business.
 Not
 only


does
 it
 own
 its
 uh
 warehouses,


distribution
 centers
 on
 its
 balance


sheet,
 but
 it
 also
 owns
 a
 large
 chunk
 of


investment
 property
 assets
 as
 well.
 And


the
 combined
 value
 of
 those
 real
 estate


assets
 is
 about
 twice
 the
 current
 share


price.
 So
 trading
 at
 a
 very
 substantial


discount,
 private
 equity
 has
 been
 very


active
 uh
 within
 the
 logistics
 space.


Mishia
 logistics
 trades
 well
 below
 book


value
 and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 pressure
 on


companies
 in
 Japan
 to
 achieve
 at
 a


minimum
 one
 times.
 one
 of
 its
 close


peers
 uh
 has
 attracted
 interest
 from
 a
 a


value
 activist
 investor
 and
 has
 seen
 its


shares
 rerate
 in
 response
 to
 that
 to


well
 north
 of
 one
 one
 and
 a
 half
 times


in
 fact
 and
 so
 there's
 pressure
 building


on
 management
 of
 that
 company
 to
 to


address
 their
 undervaluation.
 We
 are
 uh


you
 know
 intensely
 engaging
 with
 the


company.
 It's
 all
 private
 and


constructive
 at
 this
 stage
 u
 and
 we


think
 we
 we
 know
 which
 direction
 we're


traveling
 in.
 I
 know
 you're
 very
 bottom


up,
 but
 in
 Japan,
 do
 you
 worry
 at
 all


about
 the
 political
 environment
 or


indeed
 the
 fiscal
 environment?


>> We
 think
 about
 it,
 but
 as
 you
 say,
 from


our
 perspective,
 it's
 much
 more
 about


individual
 companies,


>> the
 idiosyncratic
 source
 of
 return
 that


we
 can
 generate,
 which
 will
 be
 positive


really
 regardless
 of
 what's
 going
 on


with
 the
 political
 or
 fiscal
 situation.


Of
 course,
 no
 company
 operates
 in
 a


vacuum.


>> They
 exist
 in
 Japan.
 They're
 selling


into
 Japan
 in
 many
 cases,
 but
 the


businesses
 that
 that
 we
 tend
 to
 invest


in
 have
 got
 good
 market
 positions.


They're
 very
 profitable.
 They've
 got


very
 strong
 balance
 sheets
 and
 they're


trading
 extremely
 cheaply.
 And
 uh


notwithstanding
 those
 those
 other
 risks


and
 other
 factors,
 there
 is
 very


substantial
 upside
 from
 a
 series
 of


self-help
 measures
 that
 we
 encourage


companies
 to
 take.


>> Right.
 Should
 we
 go
 a
 bit
 more
 global?


When
 we
 look
 at
 your
 global
 portfolio,


one
 of the
 things
 that
 you
 tend
 to
 focus


on
 is
 more
 in
 the
 way
 of
 closedend


funds.
 So
 in
 the
 UK
 investment
 trust,


holding
 companies,
 etc.
 When
 I
 look
 at


the
 portfolio,
 which
 is
 quite
 small,
 but


what
 is
 it
 in
 the
 global
 fund?
 About
 40


40
 holdings.
 It's
 quite
 concentrated.


>> Yeah.
 Probably
 20
 core
 names.
 Really?


>> 20
 core
 names.


>> 20
 25
 core
 names.


>> All
 right.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 it
 ge


geographically,


>> you've
 got
 much
 less
 in
 the
 US
 than


pretty
 much
 any
 global
 trust
 I
 look
 at.


You've
 got
 more
 in
 Europe,
 more
 in


Japan,
 more
 in
 the
 UK
 than
 most,
 and


very
 little
 emerging
 markets,
 etc.
 So,


should
 we
 just
 look
 briefly
 at
 why
 it
 is


that
 you
 hold
 so
 little
 in
 the
 US


relative
 to
 the
 index
 and
 relative
 to


other
 global
 funds?
 I
 know
 relativity
 is


not
 your
 thing
 at
 all,
 but
 nonetheless,


I
 think
 it
 would
 be
 interesting
 for
 for


listeners
 to
 to
 hear
 a
 little
 more
 about


that.
 Well,
 you
 know,
 AVI
 Global
 is
 a


benchmark
 agnostic
 uh
 trust
 and
 we
 take


that
 claim
 seriously.
 So
 many
 others


would
 say
 benchmark
 agnostic,
 but
 when


you
 look
 at
 them,
 they
 seem
 to
 have
 very


similar
 allocations
 to
 the
 US
 than
 the


benchmark.


>> The
 other
 factor
 is
 that
 we
 are
 bottom


up
 and
 we
 can
 invest
 where
 we
 see
 the


most
 compelling
 undervaluations
 and
 the


most
 attractive
 upside.
 In
 recent
 years,


that
 has
 really
 led
 us
 away
 from
 the
 US


and
 to
 other
 places.
 When
 you
 think


about
 it,
 the
 starting
 point
 I
 said
 was


always
 that
 markets
 are
 inefficient.
 But


when
 you
 think
 about
 the
 US
 market,
 it


is
 the
 most
 popular
 largest
 market
 in


the
 world.
 It's
 the
 most
 wellressearched


market.
 And
 the
 kind
 of
 companies
 that


we're
 looking
 for,
 good
 quality


businesses
 on
 discounted
 valuations.
 So


in
 the
 US
 buying
 a
 dollar
 of
 assets
 for


50
 60
 cents,
 they're
 not
 that
 common.


the
 price
 discovery
 mechanism,
 the


sellside
 research,
 the
 private
 equity


arbitrage
 taking
 over,
 taking
 advantage


of
 mispriced
 opportunities
 that
 has


worked
 to
 a
 great
 extent
 whereas
 other


markets
 really
 don't
 have
 that
 those
 uh


those
 factors
 working
 in
 their
 favor
 and


so
 we're
 able
 to
 find
 more
 value.


>> So
 does
 that
 make
 the
 US
 a
 very


efficient
 market
 or
 a
 hideously


overpriced
 market?
 It's
 probably
 got
 got


a
 little
 bit
 of
 both.
 But
 interestingly,


um
 we
 are
 seeing
 more
 opportunities
 uh


in
 the
 US
 have
 been
 the
 last
 couple
 of


years.
 It's
 not
 in
 the
 popular
 places.


It's
 not
 amongst
 the
 high
 growth
 tech


companies.
 It
 tends
 to
 be
 amongst


smaller
 companies.
 Companies
 that
 have


the
 kind
 of
 characteristics
 that
 you


said
 we
 favor
 investment
 companies


owning
 a
 variety
 of
 different
 businesses


trading
 at
 a
 discount
 to
 some
 of
 the


parts.
 But
 the
 one
 thing
 that
 works
 in


favor
 of
 of
 the
 US
 market
 is
 that
 even


in
 those
 situations,
 management
 is
 much


more
 focused
 on
 the
 share
 price.
 So
 at


the
 other
 extreme,
 Japan
 management


haven't
 been
 focused
 on
 the
 share
 price.


They
 don't
 care.
 They
 don't
 own
 shares.


>> In
 the
 US,
 what
 you
 find
 is
 management


are
 very
 savvy,
 financially
 savvy,
 and


if
 they
 can
 see
 a
 discount,
 they
 will


exploit
 it
 for
 their
 shareholders


benefit
 and
 hopefully
 for
 theirs
 as


well.


>> Can
 you
 give
 us
 an
 example
 of
 the
 kind


of
 thing
 you've
 been
 finding
 in
 the
 US


recently?
 You
 say
 you're
 finding
 more


value
 there
 now.


>> Our
 largest
 holding
 in
 in
 is
 a
 USlisted


company
 which
 is
 News
 Corporation
 assets


more
 global
 I
 would
 say
 but
 News
 Corp
 is


interesting.
 It's
 controlled
 by
 the


Rupert
 Murdoch
 and
 his
 family.
 It
 has


two
 key
 assets
 within
 the
 holding


company.
 The
 first
 is
 an
 Australian


listed
 business
 called
 REA
 Group
 of


which
 News
 Corp
 own
 around
 60
 odd


percent.


>> It's
 a
 very
 successful
 business.
 It's


the
 equivalent
 of
 what
 we
 have
 in
 the


UK.
 right
 move
 and
 it's
 got
 a
 very


dominant
 market
 share,
 very
 profitable


and
 as
 I
 say
 a
 very
 successful


investment
 for
 the
 group.
 So
 we
 know


what
 the
 value
 of
 that
 is.
 It
 trades
 on


the
 stock
 market
 and
 so
 we
 can
 extract


that
 from
 the
 market
 price
 of
 News
 Corp


and
 look
 at
 what
 the
 implied
 value
 of


the
 other
 assets
 are.
 And
 there
 is


really
 only
 one
 key
 asset
 to
 think
 about


here
 and
 that
 is
 the
 100%
 ownership
 of


the
 Dow
 Jones
 Group.
 The
 Dow
 Jones
 Group


owns
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal.
 Mhm.


>> Obviously
 a
 well-known
 business,
 not


only
 a
 successful
 newspaper,
 but
 also
 a


very
 successful
 online
 online
 business.


But
 along
 with
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal,


they
 also
 own
 a
 business
 called
 Opus,


which
 is
 a
 data
 provider
 primarily
 for


the
 um
 commodities
 business,
 oil
 trading


and
 commodities
 business.
 Not
 too


dissimilar
 to
 what
 Bloomberg
 does,
 say


for
 equities
 and
 bonds,
 but
 more
 focused


on
 the
 commodities
 business.
 Now
 the


implied
 value
 when
 you
 strip
 out
 the


market
 price
 of
 REA
 Group
 of
 the
 Dow


Jones
 business
 is
 around
 four
 times


earnings,


>> four
 maybe
 five
 times
 earnings.
 It's


certainly
 worth
 a
 lot
 more
 than
 that.
 If


you
 look
 at
 its
 closest
 listed
 peer,
 the


closest
 listed
 pier
 to
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal
 is
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 which


trades
 at
 somewhere
 around
 15
 to
 17


times
 earnings.
 So
 a
 massive
 gap.
 Now


clearly
 there
 are
 question
 marks
 about


the
 family
 ownership
 there
 the
 alignment


of
 interest
 the
 importance
 in
 their
 mind


of
 minority
 shareholders
 but
 I
 think
 we


focus
 on
 what
 evidence
 there
 is
 out


there
 in
 the
 public
 domain
 and
 what's


really
 been
 interesting
 about
 News
 Corp


is
 the
 recent
 comments
 coming
 out
 from


the
 CEO
 who's
 not
 a
 member
 of
 the
 family


talking
 about
 the
 undervaluation
 talking


about
 the
 discount
 talking
 about
 the


strategic
 review
 that's
 ongoing
 at
 the


board
 to
 think
 about
 how
 to
 address
 that


undervaluation
 talking
 about
 no
 sacred


cows,
 no
 holds
 barred
 strategic
 review.


And
 probably
 the
 the
 dispute
 that's
 been


going
 on
 in
 the
 family
 has
 held
 some
 of


that
 restructuring
 back.
 And
 hopefully


now
 that
 that's
 behind
 um
 we
 can
 look


forward
 to
 perhaps
 some
 restructuring.


But
 notwithstanding
 that,
 and
 this
 is


really
 key
 of
 what
 we're
 looking
 for


across
 our
 portfolio,
 you've
 got
 two


very
 good
 quality
 businesses
 within
 News


Corp
 that
 are
 growing
 in
 value,
 that
 are


growing
 in
 profitability
 year
 in
 year


out.
 So
 the
 NAV
 side
 of
 things
 is


growing.
 The
 discount
 is
 wide.
 It's
 45%.


It's
 extremely
 wide.
 And
 we
 think
 the


discount
 will
 be
 addressed.
 We
 can't


determine
 when
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be


addressed.
 But
 the
 key
 whilst
 we're


waiting
 at
 least
 is
 to
 have
 that
 pound


of
 value
 increasing
 rather
 than
 be
 stuck


in
 a
 value
 trap
 where
 you
 own
 a
 pound
 of


assets
 that's
 going
 south
 and
 it
 becomes


a
 race
 against
 time
 to
 monetize
 that


discount.


>> Yeah.
 But
 this
 is
 an
 example,
 this
 kind


of
 investment.
 This
 is
 a
 company
 where


you
 as
 a
 firm
 can't
 really
 create
 the


catalyst
 yourself.


>> Correct.


>> You
 have
 to
 stand
 back
 and
 wait
 for
 it


to
 happen.


>> Yeah.
 And
 in
 those
 kind
 of
 situations,


what
 we're
 looking
 for
 is
 the
 belief


that
 something
 is
 going
 to
 happen.
 And


it's
 more
 than
 just
 a
 belief
 that


something
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 because


it's
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do.
 It's
 looking


for
 those
 explicit
 indicators
 from


management
 that
 they
 are
 doing
 a


strategic
 review,
 that
 they're
 bothered


about
 the
 discount,
 that
 actually


something
 is
 going
 to
 happen.
 because


otherwise
 you're
 just
 left
 with
 hope
 and


that's
 not
 good
 enough.
 And
 the
 exciting


thing
 from
 about
 our
 opportunity
 set


today
 is
 that
 there
 are
 so
 many


companies
 trading
 on
 wide
 discounts


where
 there
 is
 something
 happening.
 We


don't
 know
 exactly
 the
 timing
 in
 all


situations
 but
 we
 know
 that
 something
 is


happening
 which
 is
 a
 big
 turnaround
 from


I
 don't know
 15
 years
 ago
 when
 there
 was


a
 lot
 of
 value
 on
 offer
 but
 um
 it
 wasn't


clear
 it
 wasn't
 apparent
 what
 was
 going


to
 happen
 to
 unlock
 that
 value.


[Music]


[Music]


Can
 we
 talk
 speaking
 of
 unlocking
 value


about
 the
 private
 equity
 exposure
 in
 the


portfolio?
 So
 that's
 an
 an
 area
 where


there's
 lots
 of
 private
 equity


investment
 trust
 in
 the
 UK
 trading
 on


slightly
 lower
 or
 higher
 lower
 discounts


than
 they
 were
 previously
 but


nonetheless
 there's
 a
 lot
 about
 and
 you


hold
 quite
 a
 lot
 in
 the
 portfolio
 that


has
 private
 equity
 exposure
 right


>> yeah
 we
 became
 more
 interested
 I
 would


say
 in
 the
 private
 equity
 trusts


probably
 two
 or
 three
 years
 ago


>> at
 a
 time
 when
 interest
 rates
 started


going
 up
 you
 started
 seeing
 share
 prices


come
 down
 and
 you
 started
 seeing


discounts
 widen
 and
 what
 was
 interesting


to
 us
 at
 a
 point
 in
 time
 was
 discounts


were
 in
 some
 cases
 40
 to
 50%.


>> And
 there
 was
 obviously
 a
 debate
 about


what
 the
 NAVs
 were
 but
 we
 could
 see
 when


looking
 at
 the
 secondaries
 market.
 So


the
 secondary
 market
 provides
 good


pricing
 evidence
 of
 what
 investors
 are


buying
 in
 some
 cases
 some
 of
 those
 very


same
 underlying
 funds
 that
 the
 private


equity
 funds
 themselves
 own.
 and
 they


were
 trading
 probably
 at
 5
 to
 10
 percent


discounts
 to
 reported
 Navs.
 So
 in
 our


mind
 we
 could
 see
 quite
 a
 dislocation


between
 how
 the
 market
 was
 pricing
 the


private
 equity
 funds
 themselves
 and
 what


was
 really
 going
 on
 by
 in
 some
 cases
 in


quite
 sophisticated
 investors.
 So
 that


gave
 us
 some
 confidence
 that
 the
 NAVs


weren't
 as
 unrealistic
 as
 perhaps
 some


investors
 had
 feared.
 And
 then
 for
 us


the
 question
 is
 we're
 not
 asset


allocating.
 We're
 not
 just
 picking
 up


stakes
 in
 in
 listed
 private
 equity
 funds


for
 the
 sake
 of
 it.
 We
 want
 to
 add
 some


value
 for
 our
 shareholders.
 And


typically
 the
 value
 we
 add
 to
 our


shareholders
 whenever
 we
 we
 invest
 in


other
 investment
 trusts
 is
 some
 form
 of


shareholder
 engagement,
 some
 form
 of


shareholder
 activism.
 And
 that
 typically


arises
 when
 we
 can
 be
 a
 large
 dominant


shareholder,
 if
 not
 the
 largest
 than


let's
 just
 say
 a
 top
 three
 shareholder.


And
 so
 what
 we've
 seen
 and
 I
 think
 we


we've
 played
 our
 part
 in
 this
 is
 a


sector
 that's
 now
 more
 aware
 of
 capital


allocations.
 You're
 seeing
 more
 and
 more


private
 equity
 funds
 doing
 share


buybacks.
 We
 are
 pressing
 companies
 to


take
 advantage
 of
 those
 discounts
 by


rather
 than
 make
 new
 investments
 by


their
 own
 portfolios
 on
 very
 steep


discounts
 which
 is
 a
 positive
 risk-free


return
 that's
 hard
 to
 beat
 elsewhere.


And
 we're
 still
 seeing
 a
 number
 of


attractive
 opportunities.


>> Okay.
 In
 private
 equity
 business
 as
 a


whole,
 the
 sector
 seems
 to
 be
 in
 some


degree
 of
 trouble.
 Exits
 increasingly


difficult.
 IPO
 market
 still
 jammed
 up.


So
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 sector
 as
 a


whole,
 you
 might
 think,
 well,
 it's
 not


really
 somewhere
 I
 want
 to
 be,
 but


you're
 happy
 with
 it
 because
 you're


buying
 on
 such
 big
 discounts.
 We're


happy
 buying
 either
 trusts
 that
 own
 you


know
 relative
 concentrated
 portfolios
 of


businesses
 that
 we
 can
 analyze
 and


comfortable
 with
 the
 valuations
 of
 those


businesses.
 So
 something
 like
 Oakley


Capital
 for
 example,
 a
 fairly


transparent
 portfolio,


an
 excellent
 track
 record
 and
 attractive


valuation
 as
 well.
 or
 some
 of
 the
 more


diversified
 listed
 private
 equity
 funds


where
 the
 discounts
 are
 very
 wide.
 And


it's
 really
 up
 to
 us
 to
 engage
 with
 the


board
 to
 do
 more
 to
 take
 advantage
 of


those
 wide
 discounts
 by
 buying
 back


shares,
 but
 be
 more
 shareholder


friendly,
 more
 focused
 on
 the
 share


price
 and
 take
 action
 on
 that.


>> And
 how
 do
 the
 boards
 of
 those


investment
 trusts
 enjoy
 that
 interaction


with
 you?


>> Obviously,
 it's
 mixed.
 You
 know,
 I
 think


for
 us
 though,
 the
 starting
 point
 is
 we


never
 want
 to
 be
 an
 aggressive
 bully.
 It


always
 works
 best
 to
 be
 polite,
 to
 be


constructive,


and
 that
 is
 helped
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 we


typically
 like
 the
 portfolios
 we
 own.
 We


typically
 like
 the
 underlying


businesses.
 And
 it's
 not
 a
 case
 of
 a


pound
 of
 assets
 that's
 going
 south
 very


quickly,
 which
 would
 make
 us
 which
 would


force
 us
 really
 to
 be
 aggressive.
 It's


more
 we
 can
 be
 patient.
 We
 just
 want
 to


see
 companies
 start
 to
 do
 more
 of
 the


right
 thing.


>> Okay.


>> Clearly,
 the
 investment
 trust
 space


generally
 has
 suffered
 an
 exodus
 of


shareholders.
 It's
 why
 we
 see
 so
 many


discounts.
 There's
 in
 some
 cases
 there's


a
 lack
 of
 buyers,
 you
 could
 say.
 But


what's
 interesting
 is
 that
 more


investors,
 more
 shareholders
 alongside


us
 are
 becoming
 engaged
 as
 well.
 they


found
 their
 voice
 and
 they're


recognizing
 that
 their
 remit
 to
 their


own
 stakeholders
 is
 to
 be
 proactive,
 not


just
 to
 be
 accepting
 of
 wide
 discounts.


And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 we
 do
 is
 get


together
 with
 other
 shareholders,
 write


joint
 letters
 to
 boards.
 It
 just
 makes


obviously
 life
 a
 little
 bit
 more


challenging
 for
 boards,
 but
 it
 makes
 it


more
 a
 more
 constructive
 dialogue.
 It


was
 never
 this
 bad
 in
 in
 the
 UK,
 but
 in


Japan,
 for
 example,
 whenever
 you
 had
 a


go
 or
 you
 criticized
 management,
 they'd


always
 say,
 "You're
 the
 only
 shareholder


who's
 not
 happy.
 All
 my
 other


shareholders
 tell
 me
 they
 love
 me."


Doing
 things
 together
 with
 other


shareholders
 can
 be
 very
 powerful.


>> Let's
 stick
 with
 investment
 trust
 for
 a


minute
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 listeners


are
 investment
 trust
 investors.
 What


happens
 to
 the
 investment
 trust
 sector


as
 a
 whole
 in
 the
 UK?
 Does
 it
 just


shrink
 right
 back
 until
 we
 have
 a
 much


smaller
 sector
 focused
 mainly
 on
 a


liquid
 assets
 or
 is
 there
 another
 route


for
 it?


>> No,
 I
 think
 I'm
 more
 positive
 than
 that.


I
 think
 it
 plays
 a
 very
 important
 role


and
 we're
 going
 through
 a
 shift
 clearly


in
 order
 to
 be
 relevant


funds
 have
 to
 be
 of
 a
 certain
 size
 and


probably
 the
 days
 of
 the
 very
 small


trusts
 trading
 on
 very
 wide
 discounts


that
 they
 might
 find
 their
 days


numbered.


>> Can
 I
 just
 pick
 up
 on
 on
 that?
 We've


been
 saying
 this
 for
 ages,
 haven't
 we?


That
 to
 be
 relevant
 in investment
 trust


now
 has
 to
 be
 much
 bigger
 than
 it
 used


to
 be.
 And
 we
 used
 to
 say,
 well,
 it
 has


to
 be
 400
 million
 pounds
 to
 be
 relevant.


then
 that
 has
 to
 be
 close
 to
 a
 billion


to
 be
 relevant
 etc
 etc
 but
 that
 assumes


that
 the
 audience
 for
 investment
 trust


is
 quite
 institutional.
 If
 you
 assume


that
 there's
 a
 shift
 underway
 in
 this


sector
 and
 in
 fact
 the
 market
 for


investment
 trust
 is
 much
 more
 the


ordinary
 man
 in
 the
 street
 the
 retail


investor
 then
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 a


particular
 size.
 You
 can
 be
 a£100


million
 and
 still
 be
 very
 attractive
 to


the
 retail
 investor.
 You
 only
 have
 to
 be


big
 if
 you
 have
 large
 wealth
 managers


wanting
 to
 be
 invested
 in
 you
 which


increasingly
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 be
 the
 case


anyway.


Yes,
 that's
 true.
 But
 the
 question
 then


becomes,
 how
 does
 the
 sector
 as
 a
 whole


attract
 that
 person
 on
 the
 street,
 that


retail
 investor?


>> Sorry,


>> Tik
 Tok.


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.
 The
 younger


generation
 of
 investor
 today,
 one
 has
 to


reach
 them
 in
 different
 ways
 to
 the
 ways


of
 even
 10
 years
 ago,
 five,
 even
 five


years
 ago.
 They
 are
 in
 many
 ways


confused
 about
 investment
 trusts
 because


they're
 more
 comfortable
 with
 the


open-ended
 world
 where
 something
 is


worth
 a
 pound
 and
 you
 buy
 it
 for
 a
 pound


and
 then
 you
 sell
 it
 for
 a
 pound.
 This


whole
 idea
 that
 it's
 worth
 a
 pound
 and
 I


can
 buy
 it
 for
 90p
 but
 when
 I
 want
 to


sell
 it
 it's
 80p
 that's
 just
 weird


>> fun
 though.
 It
 is
 great
 fun
 and
 but
 the


problem
 is
 that
 the
 investors
 who
 like


it
 and
 find
 it
 fun
 and
 the
 one
 who
 you


know
 the
 ones
 who
 don't
 care
 whether


something
 is
 50
 million
 or
 500
 million


they're
 getting
 old
 and
 then
 they're


taking
 their
 money
 out
 of
 the
 sector
 or


it's
 disappearing
 in
 other
 ways.
 So
 you


do
 have
 to
 attract
 the
 retail
 investor.


The
 retail
 investor
 is
 key
 and
 the


sector
 as
 a
 whole
 has
 to
 do
 more
 to


appeal
 to
 those
 retail
 investors.
 the


wealth
 managers.
 Yeah,
 the
 problem
 is


being
 relevant
 to
 the
 wealth
 managers,


but
 even
 there
 we're
 seeing
 some
 shifts.


So,
 the
 consolidation
 in
 the
 ret
 in
 the


wealth
 management
 sector
 has
 meant
 that


most
 trusts
 aren't
 relevant.
 If
 you're


running
 50
 billion
 or
 100
 billion,


>> even
 a
 billion
 pound
 trust
 is
 not
 going


to
 solve
 your
 problem
 of
 how
 to
 allocate


to
 global
 equities
 say.
 But
 the
 whole


centralization
 that's
 going
 on
 there
 and


again
 the
 whole
 focus
 on
 open-ended


funds
 within
 those
 wealth
 managers
 has


meant
 that
 many
 individual
 wealth


managers
 are
 leaving.
 They're
 going
 to


more
 boutique
 type
 firms.
 Exactly.
 To


take
 advantage
 of
 the
 kind
 of
 situations


that
 you
 say.


>> That's
 some
 good
 news.
 Thank
 you
 for


that.
 Let's
 move
 on
 to
 another
 bit
 of


good
 news,
 which
 is
 your
 shift
 towards


Korea.
 I
 know
 you've
 recently
 been
 on
 a


trip
 and
 I'm
 wondering
 if
 you're
 looking


at
 Korea
 now
 and
 seeing
 the
 same
 kind
 of


opportunities
 that
 you
 might
 have
 seen


in
 Japan
 a
 few
 years
 back.


>> Yeah,
 we're
 we're
 very
 excited
 about


Korea.
 It's
 a
 market
 we've
 been
 looking


at
 for
 a
 few
 years.
 It's
 looked
 very


cheap
 for
 a
 very
 long
 time,
 but
 like


Japan
 10
 years
 ago,
 it
 lacked
 a


catalyst.
 Nothing
 ever
 changed
 except


that
 prices
 got
 cheaper.


>> And
 we've
 now
 actually
 put
 around
 8%
 of


the
 global
 trust
 in
 into
 Korean
 names.


We
 own
 seven
 or
 eight
 different


businesses
 there.
 And
 the
 reason
 why


we've
 done
 that
 is
 because
 the
 new


government
 in
 Korea


has
 brought
 into
 place
 a
 number
 of
 laws


and
 regulations
 and
 intends
 to
 do
 more


in
 order
 to
 promote
 stock
 market


ownership
 in
 order
 to
 limit
 the
 power
 of


controlling
 shareholders
 which
 has
 been


a
 big
 negative
 of
 the
 market
 and
 has


weighed
 on
 share
 prices


>> and
 to
 address
 undervaluation
 of


companies
 on
 the
 stock
 market
 as
 Well,


interestingly,
 the
 new
 president
 came
 in


on
 a
 platform
 of
 of
 Cosby
 5000,
 aiming


to
 to
 get
 the
 Cosby
 to
 double
 from
 when


the
 point
 when
 he
 came
 into
 power
 within


5
 years,
 which
 is
 remarkable.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 they're
 pursuing
 a
 carrot
 and
 stick


approach
 to
 regulations.
 So,
 there'll
 be


some
 things
 like
 tax
 incentives
 to
 pay


out
 dividends.
 That's
 a
 carrot.
 The


stick
 would
 be
 forcing
 companies
 to


cancel
 sh
 cancel
 treasury
 shares
 as


opposed
 to
 letting
 them
 blindly


accumulate.


>> Okay.
 Will
 there
 be
 a
 dedicated
 Korean


trust
 from
 you
 given
 that
 that
 seems
 to


be
 the
 signal?


>> No
 plans
 as
 yet,
 but
 you're
 not
 the


first
 person
 to
 ask
 about
 that.


>> God,
 you
 can't
 say
 that.
 It
 makes
 me


feel
 small
 when
 you
 say
 I'm
 not
 the


first
 person
 to
 ask
 the
 question.


>> Uh,
 well,
 we
 haven't
 spoken
 for
 a
 while,


so
 otherwise
 I
 would
 have
 told
 you.


>> Okay,
 fair
 enough.
 Tell
 us
 about
 some
 of


the
 specific
 companies
 that
 you've
 been


picking
 up
 in
 Korea.


>> Yeah,
 well,
 we
 own
 one
 company
 called


Amore
 Pacific,
 which
 is
 a
 holding


company
 controlled
 by
 a
 family
 and
 its


main
 asset.
 So
 there's
 a
 Moria
 Pacific


Holdings
 and
 there's
 a
 Moria
 Pacific


Corporation
 which
 is
 the
 main
 asset


which
 is
 a
 lead
 in
 cosmetics
 business
 in


Korea
 and
 Korean
 cosmetics
 and
 skincare


generally
 I'm
 told
 is
 extremely
 popular.


>> Oh
 it
 is
 Joe.
 It
 is
 extremely
 popular.


It
 is
 extremely
 popular.
 A
 lot
 of
 our


listeners
 I
 know
 they
 all
 have


brilliance.
 Again
 they'll
 be
 using


Korean
 products.


>> They
 will.
 So
 again
 the
 operating


business
 is
 listed.
 So
 the
 holding


company
 trades
 at
 about
 a
 40%
 discount


to
 the
 value
 of
 its
 operating
 business


which
 it
 controls
 and
 this
 is
 typical
 in


in
 Korea.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 family


controlled
 holding
 businesses.
 Obviously


the
 the
 large
 Samsung
 and
 LG
 and
 SK
 the


large
 chables
 are
 wellnown
 this
 is


perhaps
 a
 less
 well-known
 company
 but


the
 idea
 of
 family
 ownership
 and
 um
 yeah


the
 issue
 in
 Korea
 is
 that
 in
 many
 cases


families
 see
 these
 businesses
 even


though
 they're
 listed
 as
 their
 own


personal
 thiefts
 and
 they
 don't
 care


about
 minority
 shareholders
 and
 a
 lot
 of


the
 regulation
 that's
 coming
 in
 is


designed
 to
 address
 that.
 So
 encouraging


something
 like
 a
 Moro
 Pacific
 to
 pay


more
 dividends
 to
 reduce
 cash
 on
 the


balance
 sheet,
 to
 cancel
 treasury


shares,
 and
 just
 to
 promote
 the
 interest


of
 minority
 shareholders.
 There's
 a
 law


that's
 being
 passed
 in
 Korea
 recently


that
 restricts
 the
 votes
 of
 any


shareholder
 to
 3%
 when
 it
 comes
 to


voting
 for
 independent
 independent


directors
 and
 independent
 auditors


>> on
 the
 board.
 So
 that
 is
 a
 direct


response
 to
 the
 perception
 that
 large


family
 controlled
 companies
 are
 only
 run


for
 the
 families
 and
 not
 minority


shareholders.
 So
 it
 doesn't
 address


everything
 but
 it's
 a
 very
 clear
 signal


and
 clear
 step
 in
 the
 right
 direction.


>> And
 what
 about
 your
 activist
 tendencies?


How
 do
 you
 engage
 with
 Korean
 companies?


>> Well,
 the
 activism
 element
 of
 it
 is
 key


as
 well
 utilizing
 the
 support
 of
 the
 new


laws
 and
 new
 regulations
 that
 are
 coming


into
 place.
 It
 empowers
 those


conversations
 and
 makes
 them
 direct
 and


much
 more
 realistic.


The
 reason
 we
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 parallels
 to


Japan
 is
 that
 change
 takes
 time.


Companies
 don't
 change
 overnight.


Families
 don't
 change
 their
 attitudes


immediately.
 There
 are
 some
 things
 that


they
 will
 have
 to
 change
 if
 the
 law


tells
 them
 to,
 but
 other
 things
 they'll


have
 to
 be
 persuaded
 that
 it's
 the
 right


thing
 to
 do.
 Yeah.
 So
 dialogue
 with


these
 companies
 is
 very
 much
 on
 the


agenda.
 We
 are
 very
 early
 days
 in
 that


respect
 but
 we've
 met
 a
 number
 of


different
 companies
 and
 the
 dialogue


starts.


>> Good.
 All
 right.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 an


economy
 and
 where
 the
 regulation
 is


going
 or
 normally
 goes
 only
 in
 the
 other


direction
 the
 UK
 where
 you
 do
 have
 again


a
 slightly
 higher
 exposure
 than
 most


global
 funds.
 You're
 what
 10
 11%
 at
 the


moment.
 Where's
 the
 value
 here?


>> Well
 again
 for
 it's
 very
 much
 a
 bottomup


case
 for
 us.
 Mhm.


>> We've
 had
 some
 investments
 in
 the


property
 listed
 property
 sector,


property
 fund
 sector
 where
 we've
 seen


and
 continue
 to
 see
 some
 consolidation


and
 pressure
 on
 companies
 to
 either


merge,
 take
 over
 others,
 or
 liquidate


assets
 and
 return
 cash
 to
 shareholders.


We
 have
 a
 stake
 in
 a
 familybacked
 UK


business
 uh
 the
 retailer
 Frasers
 which


has
 obviously
 a
 well-known
 retail


operation
 but
 also
 substantial
 asset


backing
 in
 the
 form
 of
 a
 growing
 real


estate
 portfolio
 and
 stakes
 in
 other


businesses.
 Uh
 and
 we
 have
 a
 stake
 in
 uh


Entain
 the
 online
 gambling
 company
 which


is
 listed
 in
 the
 UK.


>> And
 do
 you
 have
 concerns?
 I
 know
 I
 asked


you
 this
 about
 Japan
 but
 I
 do
 have
 to


ask
 you
 about
 the
 UK
 as
 well.
 political,


the
 fiscal
 environment,
 the
 inflation,


all
 these
 things
 don't
 seem
 to
 create
 a


great
 environment
 for
 corporate


improvement.
 Do
 you
 worry
 about
 that?


Where
 are
 your
 concerns?


>> Yeah,
 I
 live
 in
 the
 UK,
 so
 I'm


desperately
 worried
 about
 it.
 And
 yeah,


it's
 a
 big
 worry.
 What's
 interesting


about
 the
 UK
 market
 though
 is
 that


despite
 the
 big
 picture
 concerns
 and
 in


some
 cases
 quite
 negative
 headwinds,


there
 is
 still
 a
 very
 active
 market
 for


corporate
 control.
 You're
 seeing
 private


equity
 getting
 quite
 involved
 trying
 to


take
 advantage
 of
 situations
 and
 that


that's
 quite
 positive.
 That's
 what
 we


haven't
 seen
 in
 in
 in
 other
 parts
 of
 the


world
 necessarily
 and
 that
 gives
 one


confidence
 that
 if
 you
 can
 buy
 good


quality
 assets
 on
 a
 discount
 then
 maybe


something
 will
 happen
 to
 address
 that.


So
 that's
 the
 one
 positive
 I
 would
 say.


>> Okay.
 Yeah.
 I'm
 afraid
 that's
 quite
 a


vague
 positive


in
 the
 round
 in
 the
 round.
 So
 we've


talked
 a
 lot
 about
 the
 positive
 feelings


you
 have
 things
 that
 might
 work
 why
 it's


all
 working.
 You've
 had
 wonderful


performance.
 When
 you
 look
 at
 your


portfolio
 in
 the
 round,
 what
 is
 it
 that


you're
 nervous
 about?
 What
 worries
 you?


If
 there
 were,
 for
 example,
 if
 it
 were


to
 transpire
 that
 there
 is,
 for
 example,


a
 bubble
 in
 in
 AI
 in
 the
 US
 and
 perhaps


more
 globally
 and
 that
 were
 to
 collapse,


for
 example,
 what
 would
 happen
 to
 your


portfolio?
 How
 defensive
 is
 this


portfolio?
 It's
 not
 jammed
 with
 gold,


but
 how
 defensive
 is
 it
 for
 an
 investor


at
 the
 moment
 who
 is
 worried,
 as
 I
 think


all
 our
 listeners
 are
 right
 now,
 very


worried
 about
 all
 the
 things
 that
 they


see
 around
 them.
 They're
 worried
 about


geopolitics.
 They're
 worried
 about
 their


US
 exposure.
 They're
 worried
 about
 AI


overexposure.
 They're
 worried
 about


valuations.
 There's
 a
 long
 list
 out


there.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 good
 question.
 And
 I


think
 the
 point
 is
 that
 we
 are
 an
 equity


portfolio
 and
 we
 are
 fully
 invested
 in


equities.
 We
 would
 argue
 that
 our


equities
 are
 much
 cheaper
 than
 certain


parts
 of
 the
 market.
 But
 I
 think
 it


would
 be
 naive
 to
 assume
 that
 the
 very


expensive
 tech
 companies
 for
 example


would
 correct
 and
 our
 portfolio
 would
 be


unaffected
 by
 that.
 So
 clearly
 there's
 a


there's
 an
 element
 of
 beta
 market


exposure
 and
 we
 would
 probably
 suffer


some
 declines
 in
 that
 eventuality
 as


well.
 Whether
 they'd
 be
 greater
 or
 not


or
 less
 is
 really
 hard
 to
 say.
 The


things
 that
 give
 me
 some
 confidence
 are


the
 fact
 that
 when
 you
 look
 at
 our


portfolio
 and
 we
 measure
 the
 discount
 on


each
 of
 our
 companies
 and
 so
 we
 have
 a


picture
 of
 what
 the
 weighted
 average


discount
 on
 our
 portfolio
 is
 now


compared
 to
 what
 it
 is
 over
 time
 and


where
 it's
 at
 at
 the
 moment
 is
 around
 37


38%
 but
 to
 put
 that
 into
 some
 historical


context
 it's
 rarely
 pierced
 that
 40%


level
 and
 it's
 been
 as
 narrow
 as
 10%


and
 for
 a
 few
 weeks
 during
 the
 co
 sell


off
 it
 for
 a
 few
 days
 rather
 it
 touched


45
 but
 if
 you
 look
 back
 at
 the
 financial


crisis
 and
 the
 euro
 crisis
 it
 rarely


went
 below
 beyond
 the
 40%
 level
 and
 what


that
 says
 is
 that
 discounts
 are
 already


pretty
 wide


>> and
 coupled
 with
 underlying
 valuations


that
 I
 think
 are
 reasonable
 and
 not


stretched
 at
 all
 what
 I
 think
 could


happen
 is
 you
 might
 see
 in
 the


eventuality
 of
 a
 big
 market
 correction


yes
 discounts
 could
 widen
 temporarily


and
 our
 share
 prices
 could
 fall


But
 they're
 more
 likely
 to
 bounce
 back


pretty
 quickly
 because
 they're
 they
 are


already
 at
 extreme
 undervaluations.
 And


the
 reason
 why
 it
 never
 really
 goes


beyond
 40%
 is
 at
 those
 kind
 of
 levels,


you
 start
 seeing
 quite
 attractive
 entry


points
 and
 people
 start
 taking
 advantage


of
 that.
 So
 I
 think
 if
 our
 portfolio
 was


trading
 on
 a
 10%
 weighted
 average


discount,
 I'd
 be
 much
 more
 worried.


>> Good.
 Very
 reassuring.
 One
 thing
 that
 a


lot
 of
 our
 listeners
 do
 hold
 a
 lot
 of


and
 it's
 not
 in
 this
 portfolio
 though
 is


gold.
 I
 know
 and
 not
 necessarily
 your


remitt.
 But
 how
 do
 you
 feel
 about
 the


gold
 sector
 at
 the
 moment?
 It's
 been
 a


wonderful
 run.
 Hopefully
 all
 our


listeners
 are
 doing
 extremely
 well
 out


of
 that
 which
 is
 a
 bad
 thing
 by
 the
 way.


You
 don't
 want
 gold
 to
 go
 up.
 It
 tells


you
 terrible
 things.
 But
 nonetheless,


should
 they
 worry
 about
 that
 now?
 It's


gone
 too
 far.
 Should
 they
 buy
 more


mining
 companies?
 Maybe
 they
 should
 swap


into
 silver.
 I
 don't
 know.
 What
 do
 you


think?


>> Uh,
 you
 know
 more
 about
 it
 than
 I
 do.
 It


looks
 like
 gold
 mining
 companies
 are


cheap.


>> Would
 you
 buy
 them
 though?


>> I
 wouldn't
 buy
 them
 for
 AVI
 Global,


though.


Would
 you
 buy
 some
 Bitcoin
 for
 AVI


Global?


>> Oh,
 that's
 definitely
 not.
 But
 it's
 a


sore
 point
 in
 my
 household.


>> Why?


>> Oh,
 because
 I've
 been
 long
 warning


everybody
 in
 my
 family
 not
 to
 touch
 it


and
 it's
 going
 to
 crash.
 And
 a
 couple
 of


members
 did
 buy
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 Bitcoin


some
 years
 ago
 and
 they're
 laughing.


Well,
 they're
 not
 cuz
 they
 didn't
 buy


enough
 cuz
 they
 didn't.
 They
 didn't
 buy


enough.


>> Exactly.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 always
 smug
 on
 this


podcast
 because
 I
 have
 some
 Bitcoin
 and


John
 doesn't
 have
 any
 Bitcoin.
 But
 what


I
 very
 rarely
 admit
 is
 just
 how
 little


Bitcoin
 I
 have.
 I
 can
 I'm
 smug
 about
 it,


but
 it's
 tiny.
 But
 at least
 it's


something.
 It's
 something.
 Whatever


happen
 whatever
 happens
 next.
 Joe,
 is


there
 anything
 we've
 missed?
 Anything


that
 you
 must
 tell
 us
 that
 I
 have
 not


asked
 you?
 Please
 show
 up
 my


inadequacies
 as
 an
 interviewer
 by


pointing
 out
 you
 want
 to
 know.


>> Really
 good.
 Really
 good.


>> Joe,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 being
 with
 us


today.
 Hugely
 appreciate
 it.
 That
 was


fascinating.


>> Thanks
 a
 lot.
 Keep
 well.
