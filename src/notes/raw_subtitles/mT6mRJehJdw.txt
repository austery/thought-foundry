[Music]


hi
 everyone
 today
 we
 have
 a
 special


guest
 visiting
 uh
 called
 Joe
 Sai
 chair


co-founder
 of
 one
 of
 the
 world
 largest


companies
 with
 more
 than
 1
 billion


consumers
 called
 Alibaba
 a
 giant
 in


e-commerce
 digital
 payments
 cloud


computing
 entertainment
 and
 much
 more
 we


own
 almost
 2%
 of
 the
 company
 and
 you


know
 what
 Joe
 is
 also
 a
 huge
 sports
 fan


and
 you
 even
 own
 a
 basketball
 team


Brooklyn
 Nets
 so
 great
 to
 have
 you
 here


Joe
 and
 lots
 to
 talk
 about
 thanks
 for


having
 me
 Nikolai
 wonderful
 now
 let's


start
 with
 the
 beginning
 just
 to
 get
 to


know
 you
 a
 bit
 you
 were
 born
 in
 Taiwan


but
 when
 you
 were
 13
 you
 moved
 to
 the
 US


so
 how
 was
 that
 transition
 it
 was
 an


extraordinary
 transition
 I
 uh
 came
 from


a
 very
 different
 culture
 uh
 I
 grew
 up
 in


a
 chi
 very
 Chinese
 environment
 and
 went


to
 a
 Chinese
 school
 so
 I
 barely
 spoke


English
 when
 I
 landed
 uh
 in
 New
 Jersey


in
 the
 United
 States
 when
 at
 age
 13
 so
 I


went
 to
 a
 boarding
 school
 uh
 I
 thought


the
 best
 way
 for
 me
 to
 inte
 great
 and
 be


friends
 with
 everyone
 was
 to
 play
 a
 lot


of
 sports
 uh
 I
 tried
 out
 for
 a
 lot
 of


teams
 I
 got
 cut
 from
 the
 baseball
 team


were
 you
 any
 good
 uh
 I
 wasn't
 good


skill-wise
 in
 baseball
 but
 I
 was
 fairly


athletic
 and
 had
 some
 speed
 right
 I
 was


fast
 uh
 so
 I
 tried
 out
 for
 football


American
 football
 I
 played
 American


football
 U
 on
 the
 varsity
 team
 and
 uh
 uh


also
 played
 lacrosse
 in
 high
 school
 and


then
 went
 on
 to
 play
 lacrosse
 in
 college


okay
 who
 were
 the
 formative
 people
 in


your
 upbringing
 my
 father


uh
 he
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 brilliant
 uh


one
 of
 the
 most
 sharp-minded
 people
 I


know
 but
 he's
 very
 tough
 um
 I
 feared
 my


father
 um
 you
 you
 still
 fear
 Him
 I
 still


well
 he's
 no
 longer
 is
 he
 still
 kind
 of


a
 bit
 of
 bit
 of
 ghost
 in
 your
 life
 still


bit
 of
 a
 ghost
 but
 I
 I
 think
 over
 the


years
 I
 felt
 that
 I
 could
 now
 if
 he
 were


alive
 I
 could
 talk
 to
 him
 and
 say
 hey


you
 know
 I've
 accomplished
 something
 in


my
 life
 as
 well
 and
 probably
 could
 rival


your
 accomplish


accomplishments
 but
 I'm
 still
 not
 as


smart
 as
 he
 is
 you
 know
 I
 just
 love
 to


to
 see
 these
 drivers
 we
 all
 have


something
 we
 want
 to
 prove
 for
 somebody


um
 now
 before
 um
 I
 mean
 you
 you
 went
 to


Yale
 you
 studied
 law
 but
 before
 you


joined
 Alibaba
 you
 also
 worked
 for
 the


Swedish
 wenberg
 family
 the
 investor
 AB


MH
 um
 what
 was
 that
 like
 it
 was
 one
 of


the
 best
 experience
 I've
 had
 uh
 I


transition
 from
 being
 a
 lawyer
 uh
 to


being
 an
 investor
 uh
 I
 work
 for
 inv


in
 Hong
 Kong
 in
 their
 office
 and
 focus


on
 private
 Equity
 Investments
 and
 it
 was


really
 where
 I
 learned
 the
 fundamentals


of
 investing
 I
 still
 remember
 they
 gave


everybody
 a
 book
 the


McKenzie
 uh
 Corporate
 Finance
 book
 on


valuation
 right
 and
 that's
 when
 you


learn
 how
 to
 do
 a
 DCF
 model
 yeah
 and
 and


the
 discipline
 uh
 the
 uh
 work
 ethic
 uh


was
 incredible
 and
 I
 love
 that


environment
 um
 I
 still
 stay
 in
 touch


with
 him
 in
 fact
 before
 I
 came
 in
 here


earlier
 this
 week
 I
 was
 was
 in
 Stockholm


and
 had
 dinner
 with
 uh
 Marcus
 and
 uh


Jacob
 both
 both
 of
 them
 actually
 at
 the


same
 time
 which
 was
 rare
 um
 I
 I
 really


enjoy
 that
 uh
 uh
 time
 uh
 just
 catching


up
 with
 them
 yeah
 they
 are
 for
 sure
 um


are
 long-term
 thinkers
 now
 how
 did
 you


end
 up
 at
 Alibaba
 I
 was
 at
 investor
 AB


uh
 I
 think
 it
 was
 my
 fourth
 year
 uh


going
 into
 it
 um
 I
 started
 working
 at


invest
 AB
 in


1995
 uh
 and
 then
 in
 1999
 a
 friend
 of


mine
 um
 who
 I
 knew
 from
 Hong
 uh
 from


Taiwan
 uh
 our
 parents
 are
 friends
 as


well
 he
 came
 to
 me
 and
 said
 you
 have
 to


go
 to
 Hanzo
 to
 meet
 this
 man
 Jack
 ma
 he


is
 special
 he
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy
 but
 uh


you
 should
 meet
 him
 so
 I
 got
 on
 a
 flight


uh
 to
 Hanzo
 back
 then
 there
 were
 only


two
 flights
 a
 week
 between
 Hong
 Kong
 and


Hanzo
 Tuesdays
 and
 Thursdays
 I
 got
 on
 a


flight
 and
 I
 went
 to
 Hanzo
 to
 see
 him
 uh


when
 I
 went
 into
 this
 uh
 apartment
 he


had
 a
 second
 floor
 apartment
 in
 uh
 uh


the
 city
 of
 Hanzo
 and
 it's
 called
 laide


Gardens
 it's
 in
 this
 complex
 uh
 I
 saw


multiple
 pairs
 of
 shoes
 outside
 uh
 so


there
 were
 quite
 a
 few
 people
 inside


working
 there
 were
 engineers
 there
 were


customer
 service
 people
 and
 back
 then
 uh


Jack
 had
 uh
 created
 a
 website
 to
 have


small
 mediumsized
 companies
 from
 China


that
 are
 exporters
 uh
 that
 want
 to
 sell


around
 the
 world
 and
 our
 first
 website


believe
 it
 or
 not
 at
 Alibaba
 was
 in


English
 language
 because
 it
 was
 customer


facing
 to
 the
 West
 uh
 and
 uh
 there
 were


engineers
 working
 away
 customer
 service


people
 doing
 things
 I
 still
 remember


they
 had
 a
 notebook
 of
 uh
 they
 wrote


down
 every
 single
 registered
 user
 on
 the


site
 and
 there
 were
 28,000
 register


users
 at
 the
 time
 and
 and
 then
 after


about
 an
 hour
 I
 chatted
 with
 Jack
 I
 said


Jack
 I
 have
 to
 uh
 use
 the
 restroom
 can
 I


uh
 use
 go
 to
 the
 bathroom
 and
 I
 went
 in


there
 uh
 there
 were
 like
 10


toothbrushes
 uh
 next
 to
 the
 sink
 I


thought
 oh
 my
 God
 these
 people
 are
 24/7


living
 breathing
 in
 this
 room
 uh
 working


away
 that
 was
 the
 star
 of
 culture
 that's


the
 the
 equivalent
 of
 a
 garage
 right
 so


did
 you
 join
 that
 toothbrush
 Club
 I
 I


joined
 I
 joined
 the
 tooth
 I
 didn't
 bring


my
 toothbrush
 but
 uh
 I
 went
 away
 very


inspired
 uh
 not
 just
 by
 Jack's
 vision


and
 Charisma
 but
 also
 the
 fact
 that


there
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 are


willing
 to
 follow
 him
 it
 was
 very
 early


he
 didn't
 have
 any
 money
 um
 uh
 and
 the


people
 that
 worked
 there
 were
 his


students
 why
 do
 they
 want
 to
 follow
 him


what
 what
 what
 are
 the
 characteristics


of
 a
 leader
 who
 people
 want
 to
 follow
 I


I
 think
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 is
 to


give
 people
 uh
 a
 sight
 of
 what
 the


future
 looks
 like
 and
 what
 kind
 of
 and


what
 kind
 of
 sight
 did
 he
 give
 you
 at


the
 time
 of
 what
 Alibaba
 could
 be
 well


at
 the
 time
 our
 business
 is
 a
 B2B


Marketplace
 and
 he
 said
 on
 the
 cuss
 of


China
 joining
 the
 WTO
 uh
 all
 these
 small


mediumsized
 companies
 want
 to
 do


business
 around
 the
 world
 and
 alibaba's


Mission
 back
 then
 was
 and
 still
 is
 to


make
 it
 easy
 to
 do
 business
 anywhere
 and


our
 DNA
 our
 culture
 is
 to
 help
 small


businesses
 uh
 to
 to
 go
 as
 far
 abroad
 as


possible
 and
 uh
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 the


vision
 and
 uh
 obviously
 we
 developed


into
 a
 big
 uh
 domestic
 consumer
 company


uh
 as
 well
 as
 cloud
 computing
 now
 when


did
 you
 understand
 that
 this
 was
 going


to
 be
 really
 big
 I
 didn't


appreciate
 uh
 the
 scale
 until
 around


2005
 when
 uh
 that
 was
 you
 know
 six
 seven


years
 into
 our


founding
 uh
 when
 Yahoo
 came
 knocking
 on


the
 door
 and
 they
 said
 they
 we
 want
 to


invest
 and
 uh
 at
 the
 same
 time
 eBay
 was


also
 looking
 at
 investing
 in
 the
 company


and
 we
 were
 even
 thinking
 about
 selling


our
 little
 baby


called
 Tau
 which
 today
 is
 the
 largest


e-commerce
 Marketplace
 in
 China
 for
 uh


consumer
 e-commerce
 and
 uh
 uh
 uh


eventually
 we
 negotiated
 with
 Yahoo
 and


it's
 just
 the
 size
 of
 their
 investment


they
 invested
 $
 1.25
 billion
 into
 the
 uh


the
 uh
 not
 not
 just
 into
 the
 company
 but


they
 also
 bought
 out
 a
 number
 of
 VCS
 uh


in
 a
 secondary
 transaction
 1.25
 billion


that
 value
 the
 company
 at
 over4


billion
 and
 I
 I
 I
 what
 I
 still
 remember


it
 was
 the
 summer
 um
 and
 then
 I
 saw
 my


parents
 in
 the
 summer
 I
 would
 you
 know


talking
 about
 my
 dad
 that
 was
 a
 proud


moment
 when
 I
 said
 to
 my
 dad
 I
 think


I've
 uh
 made
 it
 sort


of
 um
 but
 when
 did
 you
 see
 the
 real


potential
 scale
 of
 the
 business
 when
 did


you
 really
 feel
 that
 it
 was
 taking
 off


it's
 a
 good
 question
 um
 the
 scale
 of
 the


business
 didn't
 take
 off
 until
 when
 tbal


started
 to
 monetize
 mhm
 uh
 we
 we
 knew
 we


had
 a
 good
 thing
 going
 with
 tabal
 with


buyers
 and
 sellers
 in
 the
 marketplace


but
 we
 were
 having
 trouble
 monetizing


and
 there
 were
 several
 efforts
 in
 2006


and
 2007
 that
 sort
 of
 didn't
 work
 out


that
 well
 uh
 but
 then
 we
 we
 got
 onto


something
 we
 basically
 monetized
 the


marketplace
 using
 search


advertising
 and
 uh
 so
 you
 can
 imagine


you
 you
 have
 a
 Google
 way
 of
 monetizing


the
 marketplace
 on
 an
 eBay
 type


Marketplace
 and
 that
 was
 unique
 that
 was


a
 actually


new
 Pioneer
 by


Alibaba
 and
 uh
 in
 I
 just
 remember
 in


2008
 our
 cash
 flow
 started
 to
 uh
 uh
 go


uh
 grew


exponentially
 and
 uh
 that's
 when
 we


realized
 we
 had
 a
 really
 good
 thing


going
 now
 there
 is
 um
 of
 course
 uh


you're
 not
 the
 only
 one
 who
 have
 seen


the
 opportunities
 here
 and
 so
 you
 have


now
 competition
 in
 several
 of
 your


businesses
 um
 tell
 me
 about
 the
 most


serious
 competition
 you
 all
 facing
 I


think
 the


competition
 we
 I
 can
 name
 a
 number
 of


competitors
 yeah
 uh
 and
 you
 know
 them


too
 you
 probably
 invest
 in
 some
 of
 them


uh
 and
 I
 think
 our
 our
 uh
 when
 we
 look


internally
 and
 uh
 kind
 of
 self-reflect


over
 the
 last
 several
 years
 we
 have


fallen
 behind
 because
 we
 forgot
 about


who
 our
 real
 customers
 are
 our
 customers


are
 the
 users
 that
 use
 our
 apps
 that
 are


shopping
 and


uh
 we
 did
 not
 give
 them
 the
 best


experience
 uh
 so
 in
 a
 way
 we
 kind
 of
 you


know
 stepped
 on
 our
 own
 foot
 and
 didn't


really
 uh
 focus
 on
 where
 the
 value
 is


where
 where
 we
 could
 provide
 value
 and


uh
 so
 as
 part
 of
 the
 reorganization
 our


new
 CEO
 comes
 in
 I'm
 the
 chairman
 but
 I


work
 with
 a
 CEO
 who's
 12
 years
 younger


than
 I
 am
 and
 uh
 uh
 he's
 very
 very
 user


focused
 focused
 on
 the
 uh
 product
 and


the
 interface
 and
 the
 user
 experience


and
 that's
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 for


us
 and
 how
 are
 you
 rectifying
 it
 what


are
 what
 kind
 of
 steps
 are
 you
 taking


the
 the
 first
 thing
 we
 did
 was
 to


acknowledge
 mistakes
 um
 we've


acknowledged
 that
 in
 the
 past
 we
 might


have
 not
 focused
 on
 our
 user


experience
 uh
 the
 second
 thing
 is
 to


reorganize
 our
 Personnel
 change
 the


organizational
 structure
 that
 fits
 the


strategy
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 a
 very
 common


problem
 of
 big
 companies
 big
 companies


are
 set
 in
 their
 organizational


structures
 and
 then
 they
 don't
 change


because
 people
 don't
 like
 to
 change
 they


don't
 want
 to
 uh
 uh
 change
 job
 they
 are


afraid
 to
 be
 fired
 and
 things
 like
 that


uh
 and
 then
 you
 start
 to
 fit
 the


company's
 Direction
 into
 your
 or


structure
 it
 which
 should
 be
 it


shouldn't
 be
 that
 be
 that
 way
 it
 should


be
 the
 other
 way
 around
 you
 should


Define
 what
 the
 direction
 is
 and
 then


set
 the
 company's
 organization
 so
 we


actually
 reorganize
 ourselves
 within


tbal
 uh
 the
 our
 our
 the
 our
 group
 CEO


who's
 also
 directly
 uh
 the
 CEO
 of
 the


tal
 t-all


Marketplace
 uh
 if
 you
 look
 at
 his
 direct


reports
 today
 uh
 they're
 drastically


different
 from
 who
 his
 direct
 reports


were
 uh
 three
 months
 ago
 but
 was
 there


like
 bureaucracy
 building
 up
 or
 what


happened
 what
 what
 made
 you
 not
 uh
 kind


of
 see
 the
 change
 in
 the
 in
 the


marketplace
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 human


nature
 that
 people
 uh
 don't
 like
 to


acknowledge


mistakes
 uh
 and
 true
 leaders
 and
 true


good


managers
 uh
 have
 that
 sense
 that
 have


that
 ability
 to
 self-reflect
 and
 say
 I


might
 not
 not
 have
 done
 something
 right


uh
 I
 did
 this
 wrong
 I
 need
 to
 change


they
 need
 to
 change
 themselves
 uh
 but
 it


is
 human
 nature
 that
 they
 uh
 don't
 do


that
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 we
 we
 we
 fell
 into


that
 trap
 and
 uh
 it
 you
 know
 you
 you


have
 to
 eat
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 Humble
 Pie


uh
 I
 think
 part
 of
 leadership
 is


humility
 you
 got
 to
 be
 able
 to
 admit


your
 mistakes
 and
 say
 all
 right
 let's


correct
 course
 uh
 but
 here's
 the
 New


Vision
 because
 employees
 are
 looking
 for


that
 direction
 it's
 very
 very
 important


what
 what
 is
 it
 due
 to
 morale
 in
 a


company
 which
 has
 been
 growing
 so
 fast


and
 where
 the
 share
 priz
 went
 through


the
 roof
 when
 these
 kind
 of
 things


reverse
 the
 morale
 has
 not
 been
 good


good
 in
 the
 past
 3


years
 uh
 I
 mean
 through
 a
 multiple


factors
 first
 we
 had
 Co
 yeah
 and
 then
 uh


the
 economy
 the
 Chinese
 economy
 uh
 sort


of
 bounced
 back
 after
 Co
 but
 then
 it


sort
 of
 flattened
 out
 and
 uh
 uh
 uh


competition
 was
 another
 issue
 uh
 and


also
 another
 issue
 was
 regulatory
 uh


scrutiny
 uh
 we
 paid
 big
 fines
 uh
 but


that's
 all
 behind
 us
 but
 all
 those


things
 combined
 was
 was
 quite
 uh


devastating
 to
 the
 morale
 um
 but
 I
 as
 I


said
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 though
 is


employees
 are
 looking
 for
 a
 direction
 if


you
 can
 clearly
 communicate
 what
 the


direction
 is
 uh
 then
 they
 will
 get


rejuvenated
 changing
 um
 t
 a
 bit
 uh
 of


course
 your
 business
 depend
 on
 a
 strong


consumer
 um
 how
 do
 you
 see
 the
 Chinese


consumer
 just
 now
 if
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


whole
 Chinese
 economy
 um
 China
 is
 about


31%
 of
 uh
 Global
 Production
 but
 uh
 the


consumers
 only
 consume
 14%
 uh
 Global


consumption
 uh
 so
 obviously
 there's
 an


imbalance
 China
 is
 a
 net
 export
 country


makes
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 but
 at
 some
 point


Chinese
 consumers
 should
 come
 uh
 come


into
 uh
 more
 significance
 and
 rival
 that


of
 the
 western
 developed
 markets
 uh
 in


China
 overall
 consumption
 is
 slightly


over
 50%
 uh
 whereas
 the
 developed


markets
 uh
 consumption
 is
 over
 70%
 of


the
 total
 economy
 uh
 so
 so
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 potential
 uh
 but
 the
 way
 I
 see
 the


consumers
 today
 is
 there's
 a
 couple
 of


factors
 that
 kind
 of
 temper
 their
 uh


confidence
 and
 willingness
 to
 spend


number
 one
 there's
 a
 wealth
 effect
 from


the
 property
 downturn
 uh
 I
 think
 on


average
 property
 prices
 have
 come
 down


30%
 and
 uh
 uh
 When
 people's
 assets
 a
 lot


of
 their
 wealth
 is
 tied
 up
 in
 uh
 real


estate
 they
 don't
 and
 this
 sort
 of


downturn
 happens
 they
 don't
 feel
 as


wealthy
 and
 they
 don't
 they
 want
 to
 save


they
 want
 to
 uh
 propensity
 to
 spend
 uh


is
 is
 diminished
 uh
 the
 second
 thing
 is


I
 think
 young
 people
 today
 are
 uh
 still


worried
 about
 uh
 being
 able
 to
 get
 a
 job


uh
 just
 look
 at
 ourselves
 in
 the
 last


several
 quarters
 we've
 had
 headcount


reductions
 just
 through
 attrition
 it's


not
 like
 we
 were
 laying
 off
 people
 but


just
 through
 attrition
 we're
 not
 hiring


I
 think
 it's
 important
 that
 businesses


especially
 private
 businesses
 are
 given


uh
 incentives
 and
 the
 signal
 uh
 and
 the


confidence
 to
 invest
 and
 hire
 people
 so


when
 people
 don't
 feel
 very
 certain


about
 the
 future
 about
 their
 job


stability
 then
 their
 propensity
 to
 spend


is
 also
 uh
 uh
 affected
 the
 ability
 to


spend
 though
 is
 there
 uh
 China
 has
 very


high
 savings
 rate
 and
 people
 uh


household
 cash
 is
 still
 very
 strong
 yeah


we
 had
 expected
 the
 uh
 the
 upturn
 after


covid
 in
 China
 to
 be
 stronger
 than
 what


actually


happened
 but
 it
 sounds
 the
 same
 it


sounds
 like
 the
 same
 you
 had
 the
 same


opinion
 well
 just
 I
 I
 just
 said
 uh


consumer
 confidence
 is
 quite
 low
 right


now
 because
 of
 the
 wealth
 effect
 and
 uh


uncertainty
 about
 employment
 in
 the


future
 you
 mentioned
 um
 reg
 increased


regulation
 are
 you
 still
 seeing
 um


increased
 regulatory
 pressure
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 increasing
 I
 think
 regulatory


framework
 is
 now
 more
 clear
 uh
 we
 know


uh
 what
 are
 the
 lines
 uh
 how
 to
 keep


within
 the
 boundaries
 and
 not
 to


overstep
 the
 boundaries
 so
 uh
 having


that
 Clarity
 is
 uh
 very
 good
 for


business
 um
 now
 China
 has
 been
 the


factory
 of
 the
 world
 for
 many
 years
 now


how
 do
 you
 see
 this
 development
 going


forward
 oh
 I
 still
 think
 China
 will


continue
 to
 be
 uh
 a
 manufacturing


Powerhouse
 uh
 in
 the
 world
 despite


declining
 population
 uh
 on
 a
 relative


basis
 China's
 population
 is
 still
 very


large
 uh
 you're
 looking
 at
 800
 million


productive
 workers
 in
 in
 the
 economy
 and


uh
 even
 if
 that
 reduces
 to
 6
 600
 million


650
 million
 that
 is
 still
 a
 very
 SCA


size
 sizable
 and
 at
 uh
 production
 Force


at
 scale
 uh
 uh
 the
 Chinese
 people
 are


industrious
 and
 uh
 the
 education
 system


has
 been
 very
 good
 uh
 so
 you
 have
 a
 well


educated
 labor
 force
 and
 skilled
 labor


force
 and
 uh
 just
 relative
 I
 mean
 you


know
 you
 see
 a
 lot
 of


uh
 reshoring
 or
 offshoring
 to
 people
 uh


diversifying
 their
 supply
 chains
 to


Vietnam
 Mexico
 but
 look
 at
 the


population
 I
 mean
 the
 population
 of


Vietnam
 is
 about
 100
 million
 the
 working


population
 the
 workforce
 is
 60
 million


China
 is
 more
 than
 10
 times
 the
 size
 of


that
 they
 will
 never
 be
 able
 to
 replace


China
 as
 the
 manufacturing
 center
 of
 the


world
 now
 we
 are
 know
 in
 the
 second
 year


in
 the
 AI
 Revolution
 how
 do
 you
 approach


AI
 as
 a
 firm
 we're
 one
 of
 the
 largest


cloud
 players
 in
 China
 so
 AI
 is
 it


essential
 uh
 having
 a
 a
 good
 large


language
 model
 that
 is
 proprietarily


developed
 inhouse
 is
 very
 very
 important


because
 it
 helps
 our
 Cloud
 business
 if


we
 have
 a
 great
 lln
 and
 other
 people


other
 developers
 are
 developing
 on
 top


of
 it
 they're
 using
 our
 Computing


Services
 right
 so
 so
 we
 see
 AI
 as
 very


much
 uh
 the
 left
 hand
 and
 right
 hand
 for


our
 Cloud
 business
 uh
 and
 the
 other


aspect
 is
 the


e-commerce
 um
 business
 is
 one
 of
 the
 uh


places
 where
 you
 can
 have
 the
 most
 the


richest
 use
 cases
 for
 AI
 uh
 so
 you
 can


develop
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 really
 cool
 really


cool
 products
 on
 top
 of
 uh
 our
 our
 own


model
 or
 even
 someone
 else's
 open
 open


source
 model
 we
 have
 multiple


development
 efforts
 going
 on
 and
 in


those
 scenarios
 for
 example
 you
 can
 try


something
 on
 using
 virtual
 uh
 dressing


rooms
 uh
 uh
 the
 our
 Merchants
 uh
 doing


business
 on
 our
 Marketplace
 will
 be
 able


to
 use
 AI
 to
 self-generate
 uh
 photos


product
 descriptions
 and
 things
 like


that
 is
 that
 because
 you
 is
 that
 because


you
 have
 less
 gdpr
 and
 more
 personalized


data
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 less
 GDP
 I
 don't


think
 regulation
 you
 know
 we
 collect
 a


lot
 of
 data
 we
 get
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 data
 of


our
 consumers
 and
 we
 also
 have
 uh


uh
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 Open
 Source
 data
 uh


because
 the
 whole
 sort
 of
 premise
 of
 a


large
 language
 model
 is
 you
 can
 crawl


the
 web
 and
 be
 able
 to
 get
 open
 source


data
 to
 train
 your
 model
 and
 uh
 uh
 it's


the
 same
 thing
 in
 in
 the
 US
 it's
 the


same
 thing
 in
 China
 right
 and
 uh
 uh
 uh


but
 we
 are
 able
 to
 use
 further
 use
 AI
 to


develop
 vertical
 applications
 given
 our


own
 data
 uh
 what
 we
 know
 about
 the


consumers
 and
 the
 merchants
 so
 it's
 it's


uh
 it's
 it's
 a
 beautiful
 uh
 combination


uh
 using
 AI
 to
 improve
 our
 user


experience
 where
 do
 you
 think
 uh
 China


is
 in
 the
 AI
 development
 compared
 to
 the


US
 companies


now
 I
 think
 China
 is


today
 uh


behind
 uh
 it's
 clear
 that
 the
 American


companies
 like
 open
 AI
 have
 uh
 you


know
 really
 leaped
 ahead
 of
 everybody


else
 uh
 but
 China
 is
 trying
 to
 play


catchup
 how
 far
 behind
 do
 you
 think
 it


is
 I
 think
 uh
 uh
 it
 China
 could
 have
 a
 a


lag
 that
 will
 last
 for
 a
 long
 time
 you


know
 it's
 not
 like
 you
 know
 because


everybody
 else
 is
 running
 very
 fast
 as


well
 but
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 one
 year
 five


years
 three
 years
 what
 do
 you
 think
 I


think
 today
 we're
 probably
 two
 years


behind
 uh
 the
 the
 the
 top
 uh
 models
 m


now
 um
 what
 is
 your
 situation
 when
 it


comes
 to
 chips
 and


semiconductors
 uh
 so
 last
 October
 uh
 the


US
 put
 in
 very
 stringent
 restrictions
 on


uh
 the
 ability
 of
 uh
 companies
 like


Nvidia
 to
 export
 high-end
 chips
 yeah
 uh


to
 every
 company
 in
 China
 uh
 so
 they've


sort
 of
 abandoned
 The
 Entity
 list


approach
 and
 they
 put
 the
 entire
 China


you
 know
 uh
 on
 on
 their
 list
 and
 uh
 uh
 I


uh
 think
 we're
 definitely
 affected
 by


that
 in
 fact
 we've
 actually
 publicly


communicated
 it
 did
 affect
 our
 Cloud


business
 and
 our
 ability
 to
 offer
 uh


high-end
 Computing
 Services
 to
 our


customers
 yeah
 so
 uh
 it
 is
 it
 is
 an


issue
 uh
 in
 the
 short
 run
 and
 probably


the
 medium
 run
 uh
 but
 in
 the
 long
 run


China
 will
 develop
 its
 own
 uh
 ability
 to


make
 uh
 these
 high-end
 gpus
 and
 you
 are


doing
 that
 yourself
 as
 well
 we
 we
 have


some
 uh
 effort
 of
 doing
 that
 uh
 but
 we


also
 are
 looking
 at
 other
 players
 uh
 to


Source
 chips
 from
 other
 players
 so
 how


big
 um
 an
 issue
 is
 this
 lack
 of
 chips


it's
 a
 big
 issue
 it's
 something
 uh
 that


everybody
 is
 trying
 to
 Grapple
 with
 uh


in
 the
 short
 run
 though
 uh
 I
 I
 think


prior
 to
 the
 restrictions
 coming
 down
 uh


people
 have
 stocked
 up
 inventory
 uh
 So


currently
 you
 know
 I
 think
 in
 the
 next


next
 year
 or
 18
 months
 the
 training
 of


large
 language
 models
 can
 still
 go
 ahead


given
 the
 the
 inventory
 that
 people
 have


uh
 uh
 I
 think
 there's
 more
 High


Computing
 uh
 that's
 required
 for


training
 as
 opposed
 to
 the
 applications


what
 people
 call
 inference
 uh
 so
 on
 the


inference
 side
 uh
 there
 are
 multiple


options
 uh
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 have
 as


high
 power
 and
 high-end
 chips
 uh
 as
 the


Nvidia
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 the
 latest
 model


so
 if
 you
 had
 had
 limited
 supply
 of


Nvidia
 top
 models
 and
 everything
 else


you
 wanted
 how
 would
 your
 business
 have


look
 differently
 I
 think
 we
 will
 have
 a


more
 robust
 cloud
 computing
 business
 and


we
 will
 be
 able
 to
 have
 customers
 that


want
 to
 rent
 computing
 power
 from
 us
 so


this
 leads
 us
 to
 the
 geopolitical


aspects
 of
 running
 a
 company
 like


Alibaba
 now
 what
 kind
 of
 um
 um


geopolitical
 considerations
 do
 you
 need


to
 take
 when
 you
 run
 a
 company
 like
 this


I
 I
 think
 the
 first
 thing
 is
 to


understand
 all
 the
 regulations
 uh
 we


need
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 are
 compliant


with
 law
 and
 with
 the
 policies


everywhere
 we
 operate
 uh
 so
 you
 don't


run
 a
 foul
 of


regulators
 uh
 and
 then
 catch
 the


attention
 of
 uh
 uh
 the
 politicians
 um


and
 that's
 very
 very
 important
 to
 us
 I


think
 in
 terms
 of
 compliance
 structure


uh
 we
 are
 one
 of
 the
 most
 robust


companies
 around
 the
 world
 not
 just
 one


of
 the
 robust
 Chinese
 companies
 were
 one


of
 the
 most
 robust
 companies
 around
 the


world
 I
 think
 that's
 very
 very
 important


uh
 now
 you
 know
 speaking
 of
 us
 China


specifically
 if
 you
 look
 at
 Alibaba
 we


do
 so
 much
 business
 uh
 on
 behalf
 of
 us


companies
 um
 we
 sold
 over
 $60
 billion
 of


American
 Products
 to
 Chinese
 consumers


annually
 and
 uh
 uh
 that
 trade
 is
 two-way


right
 and
 uh
 in
 in
 Europe
 uh
 uh
 you
 know


about
 14
 billion
 euros
 uh
 of
 French


products
 to
 Chinese
 consumers
 7
 billion


German
 products
 to
 Chinese
 consumers
 the


these
 are
 all
 really
 great
 uh
 stories


that
 people
 really
 don't
 understand
 uh


so
 Alibaba
 is
 good
 for
 the
 world
 good


for
 global
 trade
 and
 uh
 uh
 uh
 so
 set
 in


that
 context
 people
 can
 understand


Alibaba
 better
 uh
 and
 and
 really
 not
 say


oh
 you're
 just
 a
 Chinese
 company
 that
 is


trying
 to
 flood
 the
 market
 with
 your


cheap
 Chinese
 products
 uh
 I
 think
 it's


very
 very
 important
 for
 the
 world
 to


know
 uh
 Alibaba
 is
 here
 to
 do
 business


globally
 now
 in
 addition
 to
 the
 to
 the


chip
 act
 um
 are
 there
 any
 other


geopolitical
 tensions
 that
 impact
 the


way
 you
 do


business
 uh
 just
 generally
 uh
 being
 a


comp
 Chinese
 company
 uh
 in
 the
 US
 we


have
 to
 be
 very
 careful
 uh
 so
 for


example
 we
 don't
 have
 much
 of
 a
 consumer


facing
 uh
 business
 in
 the
 United
 States


uh
 and
 that's
 because
 concerns
 about


data
 privacy
 cyber
 security
 and
 things


like
 that
 uh
 and
 and
 these
 are
 some
 of


the
 issues
 that
 we
 will
 have
 to
 navigate


in
 the
 future
 what
 are
 some
 of
 the


misconceptions
 that
 you
 see
 that
 people


in
 the
 west
 have
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the


current
 situation
 in


China
 um
 I
 I
 think
 people
 tend
 to
 be


categorical
 about
 China
 whereas
 a
 lot
 of


the
 truth
 is
 somewhere
 in
 between
 uh
 I


find
 this
 talk
 about
 whether
 China
 is


investable
 or
 not
 quite


ridiculous
 uh
 you're
 talking
 about
 the


second
 largest
 economy
 in
 the
 world
 uh


the
 a
 very
 industrious
 labor
 force
 as
 I


refer
 to
 before
 um
 800
 million
 people
 uh


that
 are
 working
 very
 hard
 um


so
 it
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 constructive
 to


talk
 about
 whether
 to
 pull
 out
 from


China
 or
 investable
 in
 China
 uh
 I
 think


people
 have
 to
 recognize
 that
 you
 can't


bet
 against
 the
 Chinese
 people
 uh
 this


is
 an
 economy
 that'll
 be
 around
 for
 a


long
 time
 and
 uh
 that'll
 actually
 be


good
 for
 the
 world
 you
 mentioned
 that
 um


one
 can't
 bet
 against
 um
 China
 which


kind
 of
 brings
 me
 to
 to
 corporate


culture
 and
 and
 work
 ethics
 so
 what
 um


what
 is
 strong
 corporate
 culture
 to
 you


uh
 a
 strong
 cor
 corporate
 culture
 means


that
 you
 identify
 with
 the
 mission
 of


the
 company
 you
 see
 the
 company's


Direction
 very
 clearly
 and
 you
 love


working
 with
 your
 colleagues
 yeah
 you


love
 your
 boss
 you
 love
 your
 colleagues


I
 think
 that
 has
 always
 been
 the
 Alibaba


culture
 uh
 we
 are
 uh
 we
 have
 a
 saying


work
 happily
 live
 seriously
 uh
 people


always
 talk
 about
 work
 life
 B
 balance


but
 at
 Alibaba
 we
 say
 well
 why
 does
 it


need
 to
 be


a
 you
 know
 a
 dialectic
 of
 work
 versus


life
 uh
 when
 you
 come
 to
 work
 you
 should


be
 happy
 because
 you're
 among
 friends


and
 uh
 do
 you
 work
 all
 the
 time
 no
 I


don't
 work
 all
 the
 time
 um
 I
 have
 to


admit
 um
 I
 have
 actually
 found
 uh
 ways


to
 become
 more
 efficient
 so
 I
 don't
 have


to
 uh
 work
 I
 used
 to
 you
 know
 work
 a
 lot


more
 a
 lot
 harder
 you
 used
 to
 have
 the


toothbrush
 in
 the
 office
 I
 used
 to
 have


the
 toothbrush
 in
 the
 office
 but
 here's


the
 thing
 and
 what
 what
 what
 do
 you
 do


to
 make
 yourself
 more


efficient
 uh
 I
 apply
 some
 uh
 some
 of
 the


things
 I
 learned
 in
 sports
 and
 Athletics


uh
 you
 know
 like
 what
 like
 what
 like


training
 high-intensity
 training
 for
 a


few
 minutes
 and
 then
 you
 rest
 right
 so


on
 a
 given
 day
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 10


hours
 a
 day
 uh
 the
 whole
 day
 working


really
 really
 hard
 I
 would
 go
 two
 or


three
 hours
 very
 intense
 work
 uh
 I'll
 be


very
 efficient
 and
 get
 something
 done


and
 then
 I'll
 take
 a
 rest
 uh
 I'll
 read


the
 newspaper
 or
 take
 a
 nap
 or
 go
 out


for
 a
 workout
 uh
 so
 this
 uh
 interval


training
 is
 the
 concept
 that
 I
 I
 take


from
 Sports
 and
 apply
 that
 to
 work
 what


does
 it
 look
 like
 when
 you
 do
 high


intensitivity
 work
 in
 your
 office
 what


do
 you
 tell
 me
 uh
 people
 are
 very
 afraid


of
 me
 I'll
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 phone
 calls
 and


you
 know
 ask
 tough
 questions


um
 but
 I
 also
 like
 the
 fact
 I'm
 I'm


trained
 as
 a
 lawyer
 uh
 so
 I
 like
 and
 and


as
 well
 of
 the
 training
 and
 investor
 AB


I
 you
 know
 they
 taught
 me
 how
 to
 work
 a


spreadsheet
 I
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 by
 hand


myself
 um
 if
 I'm
 working
 on
 a
 deal
 for


example
 an
 investment
 project
 um
 I'll


write
 my
 own
 term
 sheet
 you
 you
 close


the
 door
 and
 have
 no
 interruptions
 and
 I


mean
 how
 does
 it
 look
 like
 in
 your


office
 what
 do
 what
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you


operate
 nobody
 likes
 interruptions
 uh


but
 some
 I
 I
 seldom
 work
 in
 the
 office


um
 I'm
 always
 traveling
 I'm
 in
 a
 hotel


room
 um
 I'm
 on
 the
 plane
 uh
 I
 uh
 you


know
 in
 uh
 sometimes
 I
 I
 just
 say
 call


in
 and
 say
 I'm
 going
 to
 stay
 at
 home
 uh


and
 uh
 in
 the
 next
 five
 hours
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 focus
 on
 doing
 something
 so


nobody
 should
 call
 me
 so
 it's
 um
 it's


never
 in
 one
 place
 it's
 always
 uh


finding
 finding
 that
 chunks
 of
 time


where
 I
 can
 I
 can
 be
 uh
 not
 bothered
 do


you
 see
 yourself
 as
 a
 nice


boss
 I
 would
 like
 to
 uh
 I
 think
 uh
 being


a
 good


boss
 I
 think
 nice
 is
 not
 um
 because
 if


you're
 too
 nice
 to


people
 uh
 you
 are
 misleading
 them
 uh
 I


think
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 about
 a


good
 boss
 is
 you
 give
 him
 immediate


feedback
 feedback
 can't
 be
 a
 quarterly


review
 thing
 or
 a
 yearend
 review
 thing


feedback
 back
 has
 to
 be
 immediate
 and


people
 need
 to
 know
 uh
 whether
 they
 did


something
 that
 wasn't
 quite
 right
 uh
 or


they
 didn't
 apply
 the
 full
 effort
 they


need
 to
 know
 right
 away
 what
 are
 some
 of


the
 other
 leadership
 principles
 that
 you


adhere
 to
 I
 I
 think
 humility
 I
 talked


about
 humility
 you
 have
 to
 be
 able
 to


admit
 to
 your
 own
 mistakes
 the
 other


thing
 is
 you
 can't
 pretend
 to
 be
 the


smartest
 person
 in
 the
 room
 always


sometimes
 you
 you
 want
 people
 are


looking
 for
 that
 leadership
 you
 want
 to


come
 up
 with
 a
 good
 idea
 whatever
 but


that
 can
 be
 all
 the
 time
 uh
 because
 you


got
 to
 let
 your
 people
 the
 people
 that


report
 to
 you
 be
 empowered
 to
 come
 up


with
 your
 own
 ideas
 uh
 otherwise
 you


kill
 Innovation
 you
 mentioned
 sport
 tell


me
 about
 your
 love
 for
 sport
 and
 why
 you


bought
 uh
 a
 basketball
 team
 I
 I've


always
 uh
 been
 fairly
 athletic
 myself
 um


and
 uh
 just
 having
 participated
 in


sports
 um
 both
 in
 high
 school
 and
 in


University


uh
 yeah
 but
 Joe
 there
 are
 lot
 of
 people


who
 like
 sport
 who
 don't
 who
 don't
 buy


sport
 clubs
 you're
 right
 you're
 right
 um


but
 first
 about
 sports
 I
 think
 Sports


teaches
 you
 not
 only
 the
 discipline
 and


hard
 work
 but
 also
 sport
 teaches
 you
 how


to
 how
 to
 fail
 if
 you
 fall
 down
 if
 you


lose
 a
 game
 you
 got
 to
 bounce
 back
 I


think
 that's
 really
 really
 important
 a


lot
 of
 those
 principles
 apply
 to


business
 so
 why
 I
 bought
 a
 sports
 team


it's
 actually
 Serendipity
 um
 when
 the
 BR


Nets
 were
 up
 for
 sale
 uh
 this
 is
 in


2017
 I
 really
 had
 no
 idea
 what
 it's
 like


to
 invest
 and
 be
 an
 owner
 of
 a
 sports


team
 uh
 but
 then
 I
 looked
 at
 the


characteristics
 of
 the
 league
 uh
 how
 the


league
 shares
 economics
 uh
 one
 of
 the


great
 things
 about
 the
 NBA
 is
 they
 have


a
 very
 good
 collective
 bargaining


agreement
 that
 splits
 the
 economics


between
 the
 teams
 the
 owners
 and
 the


players
 the
 players
 are
 really
 providing


value
 right
 so
 they
 should
 get
 their


fair
 share
 of
 the
 economics
 and
 that's


set
 out
 in
 the
 collective
 bargaining


agreement
 uh
 and
 then
 the
 other
 thing


about
 the
 NBA
 is
 among
 the
 30
 teams
 uh


it
 doesn't
 matter
 if
 you're


competitively
 successful
 or
 not
 there
 is


a
 mechanism
 for
 all
 teams
 to
 be
 even
 the


small
 Market
 teams
 to
 be
 competitive
 and


to
 also
 make
 money
 uh
 so
 there's
 a


pretty
 fair
 sharing
 e
 economics
 among


the
 teams
 for
 example
 the
 TV
 rights
 uh


the
 NBA
 today
 gets
 something
 like
 $2.7


billion
 of
 national
 TV
 revenues
 every


year
 that
 gets
 split
 among
 the
 30
 teams


evenly
 that's
 very
 very
 different
 from


the
 eepl
 for
 example
 so
 um
 uh
 I
 thought


those
 characteristics
 are
 um
 almost
 like


a
 little
 bit
 socialist
 uh
 but
 it
 ensures


that
 everybody
 that
 invests
 in
 the


league
 uh
 will
 not
 lose
 a
 lot
 of
 money


and
 the
 other
 thing
 is
 Brooklyn
 right


we're
 in
 New
 York
 City
 uh
 where
 else
 and


how
 else
 can
 you
 get
 an
 opportunity
 to


own
 an
 asset
 uh
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 like
 a


crown
 jewel
 in
 a
 big
 city
 um
 in
 a
 big


country
 and
 with
 one
 of
 the
 most
 popular


sports
 in
 the
 world
 is
 it
 fun
 it's


absolutely
 fun
 I
 love
 I
 love
 going
 to


games
 I
 can
 I
 can
 see
 you
 having
 fun


with
 it
 what
 are
 the
 other
 ways
 you're


having
 fun
 I
 I
 spend
 time
 with
 my
 kids


uh
 I
 uh
 you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 most


rewarding
 things
 is
 to
 see
 my


17-year-old
 son
 play
 a
 basketball
 game


just
 a
 high
 school
 game
 he's
 uh
 the


starting
 point
 guard
 on
 the
 basketball


team
 and
 uh
 it
 just
 gives
 me
 so
 much


pleasure
 to
 see
 him
 do
 well
 um
 on
 on
 the


court
 do
 you
 read
 yeah
 what
 do
 you
 read


well
 I
 like
 to
 read
 uh
 spy
 novels
 I'm
 a


big
 John
 l
 Cary
 fan
 okay
 and
 um
 I
 still


remember
 when
 I
 was
 a
 um
 teenager
 one
 of


the
 first
 books
 I
 read
 was
 Tinker
 Taylor


Soldier
 Spy
 yeah
 and
 uh
 I
 got
 hooked
 on


it
 uh
 right
 away
 and
 so
 all
 that


uh
 I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 ler
 the
 author
 is


has
 been
 able
 to
 uh
 take
 some
 of
 his


real
 life
 and
 turn
 it
 into
 this


experience
 for
 the
 readers
 uh
 it's


almost


aspirational
 like
 you
 want
 to
 be
 one
 of


the
 characters
 in
 the
 book
 and
 uh
 uh
 so


I
 I
 I
 enjoy
 that
 very
 much
 and
 other


than
 that
 I
 I
 try
 to
 read
 as
 much
 um


sort
 of
 current
 affairs
 I
 love
 The


Economist
 um
 you
 know
 but
 that's
 uh


probably
 not
 reading
 books
 um
 what
 would


be
 your
 advice
 to
 young


people
 my
 my
 advice
 is
 um
 learn
 one
 or


two
 very
 fundamental
 skill
 sets
 that


you're
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 on
 the
 top
 10%


of
 everybody
 else
 uh
 like
 you
 know
 if


you
 want
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 code
 if
 you


want
 to
 learn
 uh
 a
 particular
 subject


area
 uh
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 develop
 some


specialty
 my


specialty
 uh
 professionally
 was
 actually


tax
 law
 I
 was
 a
 tax
 lawyer
 for
 three


years
 and
 I
 knew
 I
 can
 go
 into
 a
 room


and
 be
 at
 least
 somewhat
 smart
 when


people
 talk
 about
 tax
 structuring
 and
 it


still
 actually
 is
 helpful
 to
 me
 today
 um


we're
 looking
 at
 some
 things


internationally
 where
 uh
 uh
 structuring


the
 right
 corporate
 entities
 and
 uh
 tax


structures
 and
 Licensing
 structures
 are


important
 so
 I
 get
 very
 involved
 in
 that


uh
 so
 someone
 you
 can't
 just
 be
 a


walking
 into
 a
 room
 and
 just
 be
 a


generalist
 in
 all
 areas
 someone
 some
 you


have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 tell
 somebody
 I'm
 an


expert
 in
 one
 thing
 this
 particular


thing
 and
 that's
 how
 you
 get
 respect
 the


other
 thing
 uh
 that
 I
 would
 say
 to
 young


people
 is
 um
 you
 know
 learn
 multiple


things
 uh
 in
 particular
 I
 think
 in
 the


future
 data
 science
 is
 important
 uh
 take


a
 class
 in
 data
 science
 it
 used
 to
 be


called
 statistics
 but
 data
 science
 is


the
 more
 fancy
 way
 of
 naming
 it
 uh
 and


also
 take
 a
 class
 in
 Psychology
 I
 think


there
 is
 something
 that's
 fascinating


about
 the
 human
 mind
 and
 how
 the
 mind


works
 and
 uh
 that's
 very
 different
 from


machines
 and
 uh
 uh
 so
 if
 you
 are


equipped
 with
 some
 ability
 to
 code
 like


young
 people
 nowadays
 they
 all
 learn
 how


to
 code
 on
 python
 or
 Java
 or
 whatever
 it


is
 uh
 have
 a
 uh
 understand
 data
 science


and
 understand
 a
 little
 bit
 of


psychology
 I
 think
 you're
 equipped
 with


uh
 all
 the
 tools
 that
 you
 need
 to
 be


successful
 in
 life
 sounds
 like
 a
 good


plan
 that
 you
 for
 sure
 have
 been
 very


successful
 and
 it's
 been
 really
 great


having
 you
 on
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 Nikolai


thank
 you
 very
 much
 I
 appreciate


it
