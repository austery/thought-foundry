This is a video about the most important
algorithm of all time,
the Fast Fourier Transform or FFT.
I mean, you use it all the time
including right now to watch this video
and it's used in radar
and sonar, 5G and WiFi.
Basically, anytime a signal is processed,
there's a good chance that
a Fast Fourier Transform
is involved.
But on top of all this, the FFT
was discovered by scientists
trying to detect covert
nuclear weapons tests.
And if they had discovered it sooner,
it may have put a stop
to the nuclear arms race.
You know I always assumed
that the nuclear arms race
was inevitable, that once
the U.S. dropped atomic bombs
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
it was just unavoidable that
all the other major powers
would develop nukes.
But maybe it wasn't because
it was clear to everyone
that nuclear weapons were game changing.
The bomb dropped on Hiroshima
released a thousand times
more energy than the biggest
conventional explosive
so other countries were
rightfully concerned.
At the end of the war, Canada and the U.K.
requested a meeting to
discuss what would be done
about nuclear weapons.
And contrary to what I expected,
the U.S. was actually
open to these discussions.
They realized that they
wouldn't be the only nation
with nukes for long.
So they offered to decommission
all their nuclear weapons
if other nations would
pledge never to make them.
This was known as the Baruch plan
and it proposed that an
international body would control
all radioactive materials on earth,
from mining to refining
to using these materials
for peaceful purposes as a
nuclear power generation.
But the Soviets rejected the proposal.
They saw it as just
another ploy to maintain
American nuclear dominance
and so the global nuclear arms race began.
To develop new nuclear weapons
required extensive testing
and most of it was done in
remote places like the Arctic
or the South Pacific Islands.
The U.S. also created a
nuclear testing site in Nevada,
the radioactive products of
which blew across the country
so that outside of Japan, the
people most adversely affected
by American nuclear weapons
were Americans themselves.
The U.S. soon graduated
from fission weapons
to thermonuclear bombs which
combined fission and fusion
to release even more energy.
They were as big leap from
the first atomic bombs
as those devices were from
conventional explosives,
a thousand times again more powerful.
- Annihilation of any life
on earth has being brought
within the range of technical possibility.
- [Narrator] In 1954 at Bikini
Atoll in the South Pacific,
the U.S. tested a new thermonuclear design
that used lithium deuteride as a fuel
and they expected the
device code named Shrimp
to release the energy equivalent
of six million tons of TNT
but they were wrong.
(bomb blasts)
It released two and a half times that
due to unanticipated
reactions with lithium-7.
And as a result, more
radioactive material was created
and it rained down over a
much larger area than planned.
Residents of neighboring
atolls were only evacuated
three days later suffering
from radiation sickness.
And further east, the 23 crew
of a Japanese fishing boat
were caught in a flurry
of radioactive white ash.
And by that evening,
they were suffering from
acute radiation syndrome.
One of the crew died from
ensuing complications
six months later.
- [Reporter] As a result
of the extended illness
brought about by his exposure
to the radiation fallout.
- These events triggered public outcry
against nuclear testing.
The modern peace sign
was designed in the 1950s
by combining the semaphore
letters for N and D
standing for nuclear disarmament.
A number of world leaders
called for a comprehensive
test ban, no more testing of
nuclear weapons by any state
and this call was actually taken seriously
by the world's nuclear powers.
They entered into negotiations at meetings
with very literal names like
the Conference on the Discontinuance
of Nuclear Weapon Tests
held in Geneva in 1958.
And to show just how serious they were,
they even stopped all testing
during the negotiations
which is why 1959 is the
only year in a long stretch
when no nuclear weapons were detonated.
But there was a big
problem with negotiating
a comprehensive test ban
which is how do you know
that the other side will hold
up their end of the bargain?
The U.S. worried that the
Soviets would continue
testing covertly and
leapfrog them technologically
and the Soviets similarly
distrusted the U.S..
So to address these concerns,
they convened the Conference
of Experts to Study
the Possibility of Detecting Violations
of a Possible Agreement on
Suspension of Nuclear Tests.
Seriously, that was the name,
I am not making this up.
Now detecting atmospheric tests
was fairly straightforward.
The radioactive isotopes
they produced disperse
in the atmosphere and can be detected
thousands of kilometers away.
Underwater tests produce
distinctive sounds
that travel efficiently around
a kilometer below the surface
of the ocean and these can
be picked up by hydrophones.
But underground tests are much
harder to detect from afar
because their radiation
is mostly contained
and the Soviets refused to
allow onsite compliance visits
which they regarded as espionage.
And this is ultimately why when
a test ban treaty was signed
in 1963, it was only a partial ban.
It banned testing underwater,
in the atmosphere and in space,
places where compliance could be verified,
but it didn't ban testing
underground for the simple reason
that it was almost impossible
to verify compliance.
But scientists had been
trying to find a way
to reliably detect
underground detonations.
Following the Geneva meeting,
American and Soviet scientists
formed a working group
to discuss the issue
and their idea was to
use seismometers located
outside the countries where
nukes were being tested
to detect the faint ground
vibrations caused by explosions.
The problem was how do you
distinguish a nuclear test
from an earthquake?
Every day around the world,
there are close to 300 earthquakes
with a magnitude of three or greater.
In addition, part of
the purpose of detecting
your adversaries tests is to spy on them,
to know how big of an
explosion they can make.
But the seismometer signal
depends not only on the yield
of the device but also on
how deep it was buried.
For a given yield, deeper
explosions appear smaller.
So scientists wanted a
method to reliably determine
whether a given signal was
a bomb or an earthquake
and if it was a bomb, how big it was
and how deep it was buried.
They knew that all this
information was contained
in the seismometer signal but
it couldn't just be read off
by looking at the squiggles.
They needed to know how much
of different frequencies
were present which meant
they needed to take
a Fourier transform.
A Fourier transform is a
way of decomposing a signal
into pure sine waves, each
with its own amplitude
and frequency that add to make it up.
This seems a bit like magic since the sum
of a set of sine waves can
look arbitrarily complicated
and nothing like its component parts.
There are some elegant ways to understand
how Fourier transforms work,
shout out to the awesome
video by 3Blue1Brown.
But I wanna take more of
a brute force approach.
If you wanna know how much
of a particular sine wave
is in a signal, just multiply
the signal by the sine wave
at each point and then add
up the area under the curve.
As a simple example, say our
signal is just a sine wave
with a certain frequency but
pretend we don't know that
and we're trying to figure out
which sine waves add to make it up.
Well, if you multiply
this signal by a sine wave
of an arbitrary frequency, the
two waves are uncorrelated.
You're just as likely to
find places where they have
the same sign, both
positive or both negative
as where they have opposite
signs and therefore
when you multiply them together,
the area above the x-axis
is equal to the area below the x-axis.
So these areas add up to zero which means
that frequency sine wave is
not a part of your signal
and this will be true for
almost all frequencies
you could try assuming you're looking over
a long enough timeframe.
The only exception is if the
frequency of the sine wave
exactly matches that of the signal,
now these waves are correlated
so their product is always
positive and so is the area
under the curve that indicates
that this sine wave is part of our signal.
And this trick works even
if the signal is composed
of a bunch of different frequencies.
If the sine waves frequency
is one of the components
of the signal it will
correlate with the signal
producing a non-zero area.
And the size of this area tells
you the relative amplitude
of that frequency sine wave in the signal.
Repeat this process for all
frequencies of sine waves
and you get the frequency spectrum.
Essentially which frequencies are present
and in what proportions.
Now so far I've only
talked about sine waves
but if the signal is a cosine wave,
then even if you multiply
it by a sine wave
of the exact same frequency,
the area under the curve will be zero.
So for each frequency,
we actually need to
multiply by a sine wave
and a cosine wave and find
the amplitudes for each.
The ratio of these amplitudes
indicates the phase
of the signal that is
how much it's shifted
to the left or to the right.
You can calculate these
sine and cosine amplitudes
separately or you can use Euler's formula
so you only need to multiply your signal
by one exponential term.
Then the real part of the
sum is the cosine amplitude
and the imaginary part
is the sine amplitude.
In the American delegation
at the Geneva meeting,
there was a physicist, Richard Garwin
and a mathematician John Tukey.
They got into a debate
with the Soviet delegation
over which nation's
seismometers were superior.
So Garwin simulated the responses
of both countries' devices
on a computer at CERN.
The next day, everyone agreed
there wasn't much difference.
The real obstacle to detecting
underground explosions
wasn't the accuracy of the seismometers,
it was the vast amounts
of computation required
to Fourier transform
the seismometer signals.
Here's an example seismometer signal
and its Fourier transform.
Thus far I've been thinking about signals
as infinite continuous waves
and when you take their Fourier transform,
you get an infinite
continuous frequency spectrum.
But real world signals are not like that.
They are finite and made
up of individual samples
or data points.
Even though a seismometer
signal looks smooth
and continuous, it doesn't
record ground motion
with infinite precision.
There is some fundamental
graininess to the data
so what you have is discreet finite data.
So you can't use the
idealized Fourier transform.
Instead, you have to perform something
called a Discreet Fourier Transform.
And one of the distinguishing features
of a Discreet Fourier Transform
is that the frequency spectrum
is also discreet and finite.
You can think of the frequencies
as falling into a finite number of bins.
And what determines the
number and size of these bins
is the number of samples in the signal
and how closely spaced they are.
For example, the more
spaced out the samples are,
the lower the maximum
frequency you can measure.
Because the samples aren't
close enough together
to capture high frequency oscillations,
the shorter the duration of the signal,
the harder it is to tell
similar frequencies apart.
So this lowers the frequency resolution.
The shorter the signal, the
wider each frequency bin is.
The lowest non-zero frequency
you can effectively measure
is one whose period is equal
to the duration of the signal.
And the higher frequency bins
are just integer multiples
of this frequency.
So they fit two, three,
four, and so on periods
in the duration of the signal.
The total number of
frequency bins is equal
to the number of samples in the signal.
So if the signal is made
up of eight samples,
then the transform has
eight frequency bins
going from zero up to seven
times the fundamental frequency.
So let's do an example.
Say we have a signal
made up of eight samples.
Well, then the discrete Fourier transform
will have eight frequency bins.
The first bin corresponds
to a frequency of zero.
Essentially this measures if the signal
is systematically shifted off the x-axis.
You can think of it as
measuring the DC offset.
You multiply each data point by one
and add them all together, in
this case, they add to zero.
The second frequency bin
corresponds to the frequency
that fits one period in
the duration of the signal.
So in this case that
corresponds to one hertz.
You multiply each point by a
sine wave of this frequency
and a cosine wave of this frequency
and separately add them up.
For sine, they add to zero.
For cosine, they add to four
and then repeat the process
for two hertz, three hertz,
and so on, up to seven hertz.
And you have the discreet
Fourier transform
of this really simple signal.
Now this process works fine in principle
and you could use it to calculate
all discrete Fourier transforms.
But the problem is it requires
way too many calculations.
To complete one discrete Fourier transform
requires multiplying N data points
by N different frequency waves.
So N squared complex multiplications.
Now this is doable for eight samples
but if you had say a million samples,
that would require a million squared
or one trillion calculations.
At the speed of 1960s computers,
that would take over
three years to complete,
all for a single transform.
Now a million samples is
admittedly more than you would need
for a single seismic event
but to analyze tens of events
per day from hundreds of seismometers,
it would just be far too time consuming
and that's what gave
scientists the impetus
to look for a better way.
And the breakthrough
came in 1963 at a meeting
of the President's Science
Advisory Committee.
President John F. Kennedy was there,
as were Garwin and Tukey,
the physicist and mathematician
from the Geneva meeting.
Although they were discussing
issues of national importance
like the Apollo program and
nuclear fallout shelters,
the meeting was apparently pretty boring.
Garwin observed Tukey doodling throughout
but what he was actually doing
was working on discreet
Fourier transforms.
At the end of the meeting,
Garwin asked Tukey
what he had worked out and
he was shocked to learn
that Tukey knew a way to compute
discreet Fourier transforms
with many fewer computations.
It would mean that the
calculation that would've taken
over three years could be
done in just 35 minutes.
This has aptly become known
as the Fast Fourier Transform.
So here is how it works.
Consider the example from
before with eight samples.
Each of those data
points must be multiplied
by the eight different frequency waves.
Here I'm only showing
cosines for simplicity.
So you would expect this to
require eight times eight
or 64 complex multiplication.
But due to the periodic
nature of sinusoids,
these waves of different frequencies
overlap in a predictable way.
For example, at the middle data point,
all of the four odd
frequencies have the same value
and all of the four even frequencies
have the same value as well.
So instead of doing eight multiplication,
you only need to do two.
And this sort of duplication occurs
at the other data points as well.
So instead of performing 64
calculations, you need only 24.
Now that might seem
like a small improvement
but it's the difference
between a calculation
that scales as N, the
number of samples squared
versus one that scales
as Nlog base two of N
which means the bigger the data set,
the greater the savings.
A signal with a thousand
samples would require
100 times fewer calculations
and a million samples
would require 50,000
times fewer calculations.
But how do you know which
calculations are redundant?
Well, take your samples and split them
into even and odd index points.
You still need to multiply
each of these by the eight
different frequency waves.
But now let's look only at
the even points and compare
the first four frequencies to
the second four frequencies.
And what you find is that in each case
at the location of the samples,
the values of the two
sine waves are the same.
A similar pattern can be
observed for the odd index points
except the values of one
sine wave are the negative
of the other.
More generally, they're
related by a complex number.
But what this means is
that you don't have to do
all the multiplication for the second half
of the frequencies.
Once you've calculated
the odd and even sums
for the lower half the frequencies,
you can reuse these values
to find the upper half.
So you've effectively cut
the number of calculations
required in half but that's
only a factor of two,
how do you get down to Nlog base two of N?
Well, you repeat the same trick,
split the samples again
into even an odd points
and then again repeatedly
until you're down to single data points.
At each split, you can
exploit the symmetries
of sinusoidal functions to
cut the number of calculations
in half.
And that is how the Fast
Fourier Transform reduces
N squared calculations down to NlogN.
And it's why today whenever anyone takes
a Fourier transform,
it's almost always done
as a Fast Fourier Transform.
Garwin approached an IBM
researcher, James Cooley
to program a computer
to run the FFT algorithm
but he didn't tell him
the reason was to detect
underground Soviet nuclear tests.
He said it was to work out the spins
in a crystal of helium-3.
Cooley and Tukey published the algorithm
in a seminal 1965 paper and
its use immediately took off
but it was too late to secure
a comprehensive nuclear test ban.
By that time, the U.K., France and China
had joined the Soviet Union
and the U.S. as nuclear powers.
And the partial test ban treaty,
far from deescalating
the nuclear arms race
just sent it underground.
The thinking was if you were only allowed
to test underground, then you
better be testing extensively
so as not to fall behind all
the other nuclear states.
So from 1963, 1,500 nuclear
weapons were detonated.
That's roughly one a week for 30 years.
This testing facilitated the construction
of an absurd number of nukes.
At the peak in the mid 1980s,
70,000 nuclear warheads were in existence.
Total expenditure on
nukes in the 20th century
is estimated at around $10
trillion each for the U.S.
and the Soviet Union
adjusting for inflation.
If only scientists had been
confident in their ability
to remotely detect underground
tests in the early 1960s,
then a comprehensive test
ban could have been reached,
stopping the nuclear arms race
before it really got going.
To check how realistic this is,
I asked Richard Garwin himself.
- Well, it's a good story.
- It is a good story.
- It would've helped and it
might have turned the tide.
- But that would've required
an earlier discovery
of the Fast Fourier Transform
and as luck would have it,
it was discovered earlier
but then forgotten.
All the way back in 1805,
Mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss
was studying the newly
discovered asteroids
of Pallas, Ceres and Juno.
To determine the orbit of Juno,
Gauss devised a novel
approach to harmonic analysis
and he jotted it down in his notes
but later used a different method
and he never thought to
publish that first insight.
Today we can see that
Gauss had figured out
the discreet Fourier Transform
before Joseph Fourier himself
published it in 1807.
And he had developed the
same Fast Fourier Transform
algorithm as Cooley and Tukey
a century and a half earlier.
The reason his breakthrough
was not widely adopted
was because it only appeared
after his death in volume three
of his collected works and it
was written with non-standard
notation in a 19th
century version of Latin.
What do you think would've
happened if Gauss had realized
the significance of his
discovery and had published it
in a way that others could understand?
With our modern network of seismometers
and computing and the
Fast Fourier Transform,
today, we have the ability to
detect magnitude three events
which correspond to a one
kilo ton or so explosion,
basically anywhere on earth.
Following Cooley and Tukey's
paper, the use of FFTs exploded
and they are the basis for
most compression algorithms
like the ones that allow you to watch
and listen to this video.
Here's how the Fast Fourier Transform
allows you to compress an image.
You take the pixel brightness
values for each row
of an image and perform
a Fast Fourier transform.
So essentially, you're
figuring out what frequencies
are present in the brightness values
of the rows of an image.
Here, brightness represents the magnitude
of each frequency component and the color
represents the phase, how
shifted that frequency is
to the left or the right.
And then you perform another
FFT for the columns of pixels.
It doesn't matter if you do
the rows or columns first,
which you need is a two dimensional FFT
of the original image.
For almost all real world images,
you find that a lot of the
values in the transform
are close to zero.
I've taken the log of the transform values
so you can see them but if
I don't, then it's clear
most of the values,
especially toward the edges
are very small and these
correspond to high frequencies.
And what this means is
that you can throw out
a lot of the information
in the transformed image
say 99% of it.
But when you invert that result,
you still get a fairly good
representation of the original image.
So on your computer, most
of the images will be saved
in this form as a two dimensional
Fast Fourier Transform
and then when you wanna
look at the picture again,
the computer simply inverts the transform.
There are so many applications for FFTs
from solving differential
equations to radar and sonar,
studying crystal structures, WiFi and 5G.
Basically all kinds of
signal processing use FFTs
and that's why mathematician
Gilbert Strang called the FFT
the most important numerical
algorithm of our lifetime.
If only it had become more widely adopted
after Gauss discovered it,
the FFT may have even more dramatically
transformed our world.
Now I don't think Gauss
could ever have imagined
how important the FFT would be,
just as most people don't think
about the cumulative impact
of their life's work.
