Welcome
 to
 a
 spooky
 and
 unplanned


Halloween
 edition
 of
 How
 I
 AI.
 I'm


Clarvo,
 product
 leader
 and
 AI
 obsessive


here
 on
 a
 mission
 to
 help
 you
 use
 LLMs


to
 do
 spooky
 stuff
 for
 your
 kids.
 Today


we
 had
 a
 haunted
 episode
 recording
 that


we
 couldn't
 get
 to
 work.
 So
 instead
 of


our
 regular
 scheduled
 programming,
 we


did
 a
 quick
 Halloween
 vibe
 code
 that
 I


think
 some
 of
 you
 parents
 out
 there
 will


be
 inspired
 by.
 If
 you
 have
 other


Halloween
 vibe
 codes,
 please
 share
 them


with
 us
 in
 the
 comments
 and
 enjoy
 this


very
 short
 episode
 of
 How
 I
 AI
 Halloween


Edition.


[Music]


Marco,
 we
 may
 we
 may
 not
 be
 able
 to
 do


our
 podcast
 today.
 We
 are
 haunted


>> by


>> expired
 expired
 corporate
 credit
 cards,


but
 you
 have
 a
 a
 Halloweenbased
 AI
 use


case
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 instead


just
 for
 a
 few
 minutes
 before
 we


>> res.
 I
 do.
 And
 maybe
 I'll
 I'll
 kind
 of


do
 it
 live
 on
 the
 fly
 here.


>> Yes.


>> And
 so
 why
 don't
 we
 why
 don't
 we
 not


just
 talk
 about
 it,
 why
 don't
 we


actually
 do
 it.
 So
 I'm
 dressed
 as


Captain
 Peicard
 right
 now.
 Uh
 as
 I
 do


every
 year
 dressed
 as
 Captain
 Peicard.
 I


mean,
 it
 naturally
 fits
 with
 my,
 you


know,


>> and
 stuff
 like
 that.
 Of
 course,
 I
 am
 a


huge
 Star
 Trek
 fan.
 I'm
 in
 the
 middle
 of


Strange
 New
 Worlds
 right
 now,
 season
 4,


>> but
 uh
 by
 night,
 at least
 for
 Halloween,


I
 do
 something
 a
 little
 bit
 different.
 I


am
 the
 block
 fortune
 teller.
 So,
 this
 is


the
 Halloween
 party
 block
 that
 I
 live
 on


here
 in
 Pedmont,
 California.
 And
 so,
 we


will
 block
 off
 the
 street
 and
 all
 of
 our


neighbors
 do
 crazy
 stuff.
 And
 so,
 you


know,
 my
 neighbor
 across
 the
 street
 is


going
 to
 have
 all
 this
 projection
 stuff


going
 on
 and
 they
 have
 like
 fire
 coming


out
 of
 something
 and
 but
 what
 I
 do
 well


I
 am
 a
 fortune
 teller.


So,
 traditionally


uh
 what
 I
 have
 done
 for
 the
 past
 few


years
 is
 that
 I
 have
 pre-created


fortunes.
 So,
 I
 set
 up
 this
 table
 and
 on


this
 table
 uh
 I
 have
 a
 a
 crystal
 ball


and
 the
 crystal
 ball
 glows
 and
 stuff


like
 that.
 It's
 not
 a
 high-tech
 crystal


ball.
 has
 nothing
 but
 a
 couple
 of
 LED


lights
 in
 it.
 But
 the
 kids
 come
 up
 and


there's
 lots
 of
 kids
 in
 town,
 you
 know,


hundreds
 of
 them
 really
 come
 up
 and
 they


they
 will
 get
 their
 fortunes
 from
 this


thing.
 Now,
 in
 reality,
 what
 I
 did
 was
 I


in
 the
 past
 had
 precreated
 these


fortunes.
 So,
 I
 make
 a
 list
 of
 them
 with


GPT3
 and
 then
 GPT4
 and
 I
 store
 them
 in
 a


note
 on
 my
 phone
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 keep
 it


between
 my
 legs
 under
 the
 table
 and
 I'll


kind
 of
 pick
 one
 at
 random.
 So,
 when
 a


kid
 comes
 up,
 I'll
 pick
 this
 one
 and
 I


make
 kind
 of
 kid-friendly
 fortunes.
 Now,


this
 year,
 I
 was
 thinking
 about
 doing


this,
 and
 since
 we're
 talking,
 I'm
 gonna


do
 this
 live
 now.
 I'm
 gonna
 actually
 do


this
 live.
 I'm
 gonna
 let
 me
 give
 you


>> We're
 gonna
 Are
 you
 gonna
 read
 my


fortune?


>> Uh,
 we're
 gonna
 we're
 going to
 make
 a


fortune
 for
 you.
 Yeah.


>> Yes.


>> So,
 I
 think
 that
 for
 this
 now,
 there's


lots
 of
 tools
 that
 I
 can
 use
 to
 do
 this.


I
 can
 use
 Lovable.
 I
 can
 use
 Bolt.
 I
 can


use
 Vzero.
 I'm
 going
 to
 use
 GitHub
 Spark


for
 this
 one.


>> Was
 not
 expecting
 a
 GitHub
 Spark
 today


on
 Halloween,
 so
 this
 is
 exciting
 for


me.


>> How
 about
 that?
 Okay.
 So
 I'm
 going
 to


say
 make
 a
 mobile
 app
 which
 when
 I
 click


a
 button
 generates
 a
 new
 fortune


in
 the
 context
 of
 a
 fortune
 teller.


Okay.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 need
 to
 tell
 it


much
 more
 than
 that.
 It's
 probably
 going


to
 kind
 of
 work
 on
 the
 first
 try.
 Well,


we'll
 see.
 Let's
 see
 what
 this
 does.
 Now


you
 know
 in
 other
 circumstances
 I
 have


sometimes
 given
 it
 like
 a
 list
 of
 things


to
 scroll
 between.
 You
 might
 have
 seen


on
 the
 screen
 that
 earlier
 I
 had
 a


chemistry
 ion
 flashcards
 app.
 My


daughter
 uh
 is
 in
 honors
 chemistry
 and


she
 was
 at
 the
 time
 studying
 polyatomic


ions
 uh
 chlorate
 perchlorate
 you
 know


sulfate
 stuff
 like
 that.
 And
 uh
 she


needed
 to
 memorize
 the
 name
 to
 the
 the


formula
 of
 these
 poly
 ions.
 And
 so
 I


made
 a
 flashc
 cards
 app
 with
 this
 thing


which
 actually
 worked
 really
 well.
 I


mean
 I
 just
 gave
 it
 basically
 the
 list


of
 the
 polyatomic
 ions
 and
 it
 totally


freaking
 did
 it
 in
 this
 kind
 of
 flash


card
 interface
 that
 worked
 on
 the
 phone


and
 so
 that
 was
 pretty
 nice.
 That's
 kind


of
 one
 of the
 reasons
 why
 I
 decided
 to


go
 with
 GitHub
 Spark
 for
 this
 one
 is


because
 I
 know
 that
 kind
 of
 worked
 for


me
 before
 and
 in
 a
 way
 you
 could
 look
 at


this
 as
 kind
 of
 being
 a
 flashc
 card
 app


too.
 It's
 going
 to
 kind
 of
 make
 these


flash
 cards
 of
 fortunes
 I
 guess.


>> Um


>> oh
 my
 gosh.
 Well,
 I
 I
 have
 a
 block
 party


tomorrow,
 so


I
 might
 steal
 your
 idea.


>> You
 could
 do
 this.


>> Definitely
 pass
 for
 a
 fortune
 teller
 as


well,
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 Oh
 my
 gosh.
 Okay,
 so
 this
 is
 going


to
 Oh,
 it
 made
 a
 PRD.
 That's,
 you
 know,


I
 loved.
 Let's
 see.
 Can
 we
 see
 it?
 Let's


see
 if
 we
 can
 see
 what
 it's
 doing
 while


it's
 doing
 it.
 Oh,
 it
 does.
 Okay.
 So,


wow.
 It's
 really
 It's
 going
 fast
 and


furious
 over
 here.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 totally


writing
 this
 PRD
 over
 here.
 And
 now
 it's


it's
 made
 a
 page
 index.
 So
 it's
 starting


to
 make
 the
 actual
 HTML.
 So
 it's
 it's


going
 to
 write
 this
 in
 HTML
 and
 you
 know


this
 is
 this
 is
 common
 and
 now
 it's
 got


some
 CSS.
 So
 it's
 going
 to
 style
 uh
 the


page.
 Uh
 but
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 this
 is
 vibe


coding
 or
 anyway
 front-end
 vibe
 coding


as
 we
 do
 it
 today.
 Uh
 now
 in
 reality


though
 I
 mean
 when
 I'm
 doing
 real
 vibe


coding
 uh
 projects
 and
 while
 this
 thing


is
 working
 since
 I
 actually
 already
 have


this
 on
 my
 screen
 I'm
 going
 to
 bust
 this


out
 over
 here.
 Now,
 if
 I'm
 doing
 a
 real


project,
 like
 a
 serious
 project,
 not


just
 a
 little
 fortune
 teller
 app


nowadays,
 I
 will
 100%
 use
 specit.
 Uh
 I


absolutely
 do
 use
 spec
 kit.
 In
 fact,
 it


so
 happens
 I
 was
 earlier
 today
 working


on
 just
 such
 a
 project.
 So,
 I
 am
 by
 the


way,
 I'm
 VB
 products
 of
 corei
 at


Microsoft.
 However,
 uh
 I
 do
 come
 from
 an


engineering
 background
 and
 I
 still
 code


pretty
 much
 every
 day
 something.
 So,
 I'm


working
 on
 this
 project
 and
 in
 this


project
 uh
 where
 I
 did
 use
 spec
 kit.
 So


here
 like
 this
 is
 a
 full
 feature


specification
 that
 I'm
 working
 on.
 I


have
 this
 whole
 agent
 thing
 that
 I'm
 I'm


working
 on
 and
 uh
 I
 am
 adding
 this


ability
 to
 give
 user
 feedback.
 So
 this


agent
 will
 like
 fill
 out
 a
 questionnaire


for
 me
 and
 that's
 cool
 but
 I
 want
 to
 be


able
 to
 pick
 a
 a
 cell
 a
 question
 and
 be


like
 no
 no no
 you
 did
 that
 wrong
 fix
 it.


And
 then
 the
 agent
 should
 just
 wake
 up


and
 do
 it
 when
 you
 use
 spec
 kit.
 And
 so


like
 this
 is
 the
 proper
 way
 to
 write
 a


spec.
 Uh
 when
 you
 use
 spec
 kit
 it
 does


this
 stuff
 over
 here.
 So
 you
 see
 what


it's
 going
 to
 do.
 it
 throws
 these


questions
 at
 me.
 So,
 it's
 like,
 wait
 a


minute,
 how
 long
 should
 the
 feedback
 be?


What
 if
 the
 user
 gives
 you
 like
 a
 ton
 of


feedback?
 Then
 what
 do
 I
 do?
 And
 it


it'll
 it'll
 lob
 all
 of
 these
 questions


at
 me
 while
 it
 does
 this.
 So,
 spec
 kit


is
 cool.
 It's
 totally
 free.
 It
 works


with
 like
 in
 this
 case
 I'm
 using
 it
 with


GitHub
 profil,
 but
 it
 works
 with
 FOD


code
 and
 it
 works
 with
 cursor
 and
 all


these
 other
 things.
 So,
 that
 is
 super


cool.
 Uh,
 I
 love
 it.
 It
 helps
 you
 write


a
 better
 spec.
 Uh,
 but


>> oh,
 look
 at
 this.


>> My
 app
 is
 here.
 Okay.
 Tap
 to
 reveal
 your


fortune,
 the
 cosmos.


>> Okay,


>> I'm
 very
 excited
 about
 this.


>> Wow.
 Okay,


>> that's
 a
 little
 bit
 too
 uh


>> let
 me
 let
 me
 read
 this
 for
 people
 that


are
 not
 on
 video.
 In
 the
 tapestry
 of
 the


cosmos,
 the
 stars
 weave
 a
 path


illuminated
 by
 your
 dreams.
 Trust
 in


their
 guiding
 light.
 Now,
 what
 I
 like


about
 this
 is
 it
 is
 completely
 ambiguous


and
 means
 nothing.
 Excellent.
 excellent


fortune,
 but
 I
 bet
 you
 want
 it
 to
 be
 a


little
 more
 fun
 and
 kids
 friendly
 for


for
 your
 use
 case.


>> And
 so
 over
 here
 on
 the
 left
 hand
 side,


you
 can
 see
 that
 I'm
 saying
 make
 each


fortune
 only
 one
 sentence
 and
 make
 it


kid-friendly.
 So
 now
 I'm
 going
 to
 kind


of
 prompt
 my
 way
 towards
 doing
 something


and
 it's
 starting
 to
 generate
 again.
 So


I
 mean
 I
 mean
 you
 got
 to
 admit
 though,
 I


mean
 it's
 pretty
 freaking
 good
 on
 the


first
 try.


>> Really
 good.
 You
 know
 what?
 I
 haven't


seen
 um
 this
 GitHub
 Spark
 uh
 done
 live,


but
 the
 design
 is
 actually
 really
 cute.


So,
 so
 often
 in
 these
 vibe
 coding
 tools,


you
 get
 these
 incredibly
 boring
 designs,


but
 that
 is
 actually
 quite
 quite
 lovely.


Okay.


>> All
 right.
 Did
 we
 get
 it?


>> It's
 done.
 It
 says
 it's
 done.
 So,
 here


we
 go.
 Let's
 see
 what
 happens.


>> Mystic
 Oracle,
 what
 is
 my
 fortune?


When
 you
 sprinkle
 kindness
 like
 fairy


dust,
 the
 whole
 world
 transforms
 into
 a


playground
 of
 magical
 adventures
 and


shimmering
 smiles.


>> That's
 it.
 Is
 that
 is
 lovely
 and


kid-friendly.


>> Still
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 the
 big


words
 there.
 I
 mean,
 I
 can


>> And
 on
 the
 abstract
 side,


>> yeah,
 on
 the
 abstract
 side,
 I
 mean,
 uh,


let's
 see.
 Make
 the
 fortunes
 a
 little


more
 concrete


>> and
 and
 let's
 make
 them
 a
 little
 more


fun


>> and
 maybe
 a
 little
 more
 humorous.


>> Yeah.


try
 not
 to
 use
 such
 big
 words.


I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 like
 the
 kids


that'll
 come
 up
 to
 my
 fortuneelling


booth,
 they'll
 be
 like,
 you
 know,
 two
 or


three
 years
 old,
 you
 know?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> And
 for
 them
 sometimes
 I'll
 like
 not


even
 use
 my
 little
 app
 thing
 and
 I'll
 be


like,


>> "You're
 going
 to
 try
 a
 new
 food
 today


and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 yummy."


And
 their
 parents
 will
 be
 like,
 "Thank


you."
 Like


>> your
 candy
 in
 your
 Halloween
 bag
 will


multiply.
 But
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 Peepon


is
 a
 small
 town
 and
 I
 actually
 know
 a


lot of
 these
 parents
 and
 stuff
 like


that.
 Sometimes
 they
 come
 back
 at
 me


later
 and
 they're
 like,
 "You
 told
 my
 kid


this
 fortune."
 Like
 I
 told
 one
 kid
 a


fortune
 once
 and
 it
 was
 like,
 "You're


going
 to
 make
 a
 new
 friend
 today."
 Which


actually
 did
 come
 from
 my
 my
 the


previous
 version
 of
 this
 uh
 generation.


>> And
 uh
 she
 said
 he
 was
 talking
 about
 it


for
 the
 whole
 next
 day.
 She
 was
 like,


"The
 fortune
 teller
 said,
 "I'm
 going
 to


make
 a
 friend
 today.
 Like
 this
 is
 going


to
 be
 cool."


>> Well,
 your
 kid's
 15.
 Should
 I
 uh
 tell


her
 she's
 going
 to
 get
 a
 car
 in
 her


future?


Now,
 okay,
 now
 now
 we're
 going
 off
 the


rails
 here.
 Okay,
 here
 we
 go.
 You
 ready?


Here's
 your
 This
 is
 This
 one's
 for
 you,


Claire.
 Okay,
 ready?


>> This
 week,
 you
 will
 find
 a
 shiny
 rock


that
 looks
 like
 a
 slice
 of
 pizza
 and


makes
 everyone
 giggle
 when
 you


>> like
 that.
 That
 would
 entertain
 my


six-year-old.


>> I
 mean,
 that
 is
 very
 concrete
 for
 sure.


And
 now,
 you
 know,
 your
 six-year-old


Yeah.
 would
 totally
 be
 looking
 for,
 oh,


where's
 that
 rock
 that
 looks
 like
 the


slice
 of
 pizza?
 I'm
 gonna
 find
 it.


>> That's
 exactly
 right.
 Okay.
 I


>> One
 more.


>> One
 more.
 Let's
 see.
 One
 more.
 This
 week


we're
 Okay,
 again
 with
 the
 rock
 and


maybe
 it's
 going
 a
 little
 over
 much
 on


the
 rocks
 here.
 You
 recover
 a
 rock
 that


looks
 like
 a
 cupcake.
 Sprinkles
 of
 that.


I
 mean,
 this
 is
 why
 you
 you
 got
 to
 like


integration
 test
 these
 things.
 Are
 these


all
 rocks?
 Oh
 no.
 Today
 a
 fluffy


squirrel
 will
 steal
 your
 snack,
 but
 then


share
 a
 secret
 about
 the
 best
 hiding


spots
 in
 the
 park.
 Okay.


>> I'm
 surprised
 the
 squirrel
 is
 not


sharing
 the
 secret
 about
 the
 best
 rocks


in
 the
 park.
 So,


I
 mean,


>> you
 got
 it.
 Okay.
 I
 um
 you
 know,
 it's


it's
 Halloween.
 It's
 almost
 11:00
 a.m.


I've
 got
 my
 block
 party
 is
 tomorrow.
 So,


we're
 blocking
 off
 the
 street.
 We're


doing
 a
 posth
 Halloween.
 Everybody
 bring


your
 candy
 so
 you
 can
 give
 it
 all
 more


away
 party.
 And
 I'm
 gonna
 do
 this.
 I'm


going
 to
 hook
 it
 up
 to
 voice.


>> Sweet.


give
 it
 like
 a
 spooky
 fortune
 teller


voice
 and
 uh
 set
 it
 up
 out
 front.
 Well,


Marco,
 despite
 our
 haunted


podcast
 episode,
 we
 will
 get
 you
 back
 on


to
 actually
 talk
 about
 Spectrian


development,
 but
 thank
 you
 for
 doing
 our


first
 and
 maybe
 an
 annual
 tradition
 of


our
 Halloween
 AI
 how
 I
 AI
 episode.
 Thank

 for
 showing
 this.


>> Every

 have
 like
 different


elements
 to
 Halloween
 every
 year.


>> Perfect.
 Well,
