But
 I've
 been
 investing
 and
 working
 in


technology
 companies
 since
 1999.
 I've


seen
 a
 bunch
 of
 technologies
 come
 and


go.
 I
 saw
 the
 first
 crash.
 I
 was
 working


in
 the
 mobile
 phone
 industry
 when
 all
 of


a
 sudden
 the
 world
 discovered
 mobile


phones.
 What
 I
 think
 that
 does
 is
 it


changes
 the
 lens
 under
 which
 you
 look
 at


new
 technologies
 and
 new
 developments.


When
 I
 was
 investing
 in
 2022,
 I
 was
 not


investing
 in
 what
 everybody
 else
 was


investing
 in
 because
 I
 felt
 like
 we
 were


going
 straight
 up
 the
 hype
 curve.
 You


want
 to
 invest
 when
 nobody
 else
 is


investing.
 And
 if
 everybody's
 investing


in
 the
 same
 thing,
 you
 probably


shouldn't
 be
 in
 there.
 You
 should


wait.
 Hi,
 my
 name
 is
 Terry
 Doyle.
 I'm


the
 managing
 partner
 of
 Telus
 Global


Ventures.
 We're
 the
 corporate
 venturing


arm
 of
 Telus,
 which
 is
 a
 Canadian


headquartered
 global
 technology
 and


services
 business.
 So,
 we
 have
 about
 90


companies
 in
 our
 portfolio.
 60%
 of
 them


have
 a
 commercial
 deal
 with
 Telus.
 Last


year
 we
 did
 about
 $34
 million
 of


business
 with
 our
 portfolio


companies.
 Age
 is
 not
 a
 determination
 of


intelligence.
 And
 in
 fact,
 some
 of
 the


best
 founders
 I
 meet
 are
 great
 because


they
 don't
 have
 preformed
 ideas.


Sometimes
 you
 meet
 people
 and
 they've


got
 lots
 of
 experience
 and
 because
 of


that
 experience
 something
 that
 hasn't


worked
 they
 sort
 of
 shut
 their
 minds
 off


that
 doesn't
 work
 I
 can't
 do
 this
 I


can't
 solve
 this
 problem
 this
 way


whereas
 I
 think
 sometimes
 people
 who


maybe
 don't
 have
 that
 experience
 they


bring
 a
 very
 new
 perspective
 to
 solving


a
 problem
 and
 say
 they
 don't
 make


assumptions
 if
 you
 talk
 to
 people
 in
 in


great
 companies
 like
 uh
 Google
 they


spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 trying
 to
 prevent


people
 from
 making
 those
 assumptions


Your
 response
 to
 this
 question
 is
 X.
 Do


you
 realize
 that
 there's
 two
 assumptions


that
 are
 part
 of
 that?
 Why
 have
 you
 made


those
 assumptions?
 Oh,
 that's
 always
 how


it's
 always
 been.
 Removing
 that
 bias


almost
 is
 where
 you
 get
 some
 real


breakthroughs.
 We've
 invested
 in


companies
 like
 Clinia,
 which
 has
 really


developed
 an
 AIdriven
 optimized
 search


for
 enterprise
 customers
 and
 that
 helps


providers
 give
 better
 outcomes
 to


patients.
 We
 knew
 we
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 data,


but
 again,
 data
 is
 only
 as
 good
 as
 how


it's
 presented,
 how
 it's
 accessed.


Lineia
 has
 really
 changed
 the
 way
 we


think
 about
 what
 we
 can
 do
 with
 that


data
 and
 that
 business.
 It's
 changed
 how


our
 customers
 think
 about
 their
 own


data,
 but
 also
 how
 they
 they
 run
 their


businesses.
 Creating
 that
 shift
 in
 the


way
 we
 think
 and
 how
 our
 customers
 think


was
 really
 one
 of
 the
 important
 outcomes


that
 we
 got
 in
 making
 that
 investment.


But
 I've
 been
 investing
 and
 working
 in


technology
 companies
 since
 1999.
 I've


seen
 a
 bunch
 of
 technologies
 come
 and


go.
 I
 saw
 the
 first
 dot
 crash
 when
 web


van
 got
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 dollars


investment
 and
 then
 went
 bankrupt.
 You


know,
 I
 was
 working
 in
 the
 mobile
 phone


industry
 when
 all
 of a
 sudden
 the
 world


discovered
 mobile
 phones.
 What
 I
 think


that
 does
 is
 it
 changes
 the
 lens
 under


which
 you
 look
 at
 new
 technologies
 and


new
 developments.


2014
 I
 was
 spending
 time
 with
 a
 whole


bunch
 of
 some
 of
 the
 best
 people
 in
 the


world
 in
 artificial
 intelligence.
 This


is
 great.
 You
 know,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a


good
 development.
 Maybe
 I
 won't
 be
 as


excited
 about
 the
 changes
 in
 the


marketplace
 as
 if
 I'd
 never
 seen
 those


previous
 cycles.
 It
 means
 that
 when
 I


was
 investing
 in
 2022,
 I
 was
 not


investing
 in
 what
 everybody
 else
 was


investing
 in
 because
 I
 felt
 like
 we
 were


going
 straight
 up
 the
 hype
 curve.
 You


want
 to
 invest
 when
 nobody
 else
 is


investing.
 And
 if
 everybody's
 investing


in
 the
 same
 thing,
 you
 probably


shouldn't
 be
 in
 there.
 You
 should
 wait.


When
 a
 good
 investor
 is
 able
 to
 see
 a


fundamental
 shift
 in
 society,
 you
 know,


the
 consulting
 firm
 McKenzie
 has
 a


language
 which
 is
 horizon
 1,
 horizon
 2,


horizon
 3.
 Horizon
 1
 is
 something
 that


we
 can
 use
 now.
 It's
 getting
 to
 the


beginning
 parts
 of
 the
 use
 of
 its
 life


in
 as
 a
 technology.
 Horizon
 3
 is
 well


into
 the
 future,
 very
 far
 away
 from


being
 commercialized.
 More
 like


fundamental
 science.
 We
 will
 sometimes


want
 to
 make
 an
 investment
 in
 a
 Horizon


3
 company
 and
 the
 business
 just
 doesn't


see
 the
 opportunity
 for
 it.
 The
 area
 of


quantum
 security
 is
 a
 good
 example
 of


this.
 We
 know
 that
 at
 some
 point
 in
 the


future
 quantum
 will
 change
 how
 people


can
 they
 will
 create
 tools
 where
 people


can
 do
 harm
 just
 as
 we
 start
 to
 see
 in


AI.
 We've
 done
 some
 investing
 in
 quantum


security
 and
 we're
 not
 quite
 at
 that


point
 where
 we
 can
 use
 it.
 We
 have
 to


make
 a
 an
 educated
 guess.
 Okay,
 we
 think


this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 problem
 in
 the


future.
 So
 we
 we
 should
 probably
 invest


early
 and
 learn
 get
 we'll
 call
 it


tuition
 value
 about
 how
 this
 particular


space
 is
 evolving
 and
 as
 a
 result
 we'll


wait
 five
 or
 6
 years
 before
 we
 have
 any


commercial
 deal
 with
 the
 company.
 Being


able
 to
 spot
 the
 large
 shifts
 make
 you


better
 able
 to
 invest
 in
 the
 right


things.
 I
 think
 if
 you
 jump
 at
 every
 new


development
 I
 think
 you're
 probably


going
 to
 have
 a
 hard
 time.
 You're


probably
 going
 to
 make
 a
 lot
 of


mistakes.


You
 know,
 I
 talk
 to
 my
 team
 all
 the
 time


about
 this
 idea
 that
 we
 will
 make


mistakes.
 As
 soon
 as
 you
 say
 that,
 that


changes
 the
 way
 people
 do
 things
 because


they
 don't
 freeze
 up.
 They're
 not


nervous
 about
 making
 a
 mistake.
 So,
 one,


we're
 going
 to
 make
 mistakes.
 Most


important
 thing
 is
 acknowledge
 that


you've
 made
 a
 mistake.
 Second
 is
 fix
 the


mistake
 as
 best
 you
 can.
 And
 third
 is


obviously
 the
 most
 important
 thing.


Don't
 make
 the
 same
 mistake
 twice.
 I


think
 if
 you
 create
 that
 environment
 for


people,
 they
 feel
 more
 comfortable.
 They


explore
 options
 more.
 they
 don't
 freeze


up
 and
 be
 conservative
 in
 how
 they


think.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 really


our
 job.
 Our
 job
 is
 to
 take
 risk
 on


behalf
 of
 the
 company
 and
 do
 that
 in
 a


way
 which
 is
 sensible,
 but
 to
 push
 the


company
 and
 to
 help
 get
 more
 technology


into
 the
 hands
 of
 our
 customers
 to
 make


their
 lives


better.
 You'll
 hear
 many
 investors
 talk


about
 are
 you
 investing
 in
 the


individual
 or
 are
 you
 investing
 in
 the


idea
 or
 the
 market.
 I
 think
 the


individual
 is
 really
 the
 most


determinative
 factor.
 Somebody's
 ability


to
 solve
 problems
 and
 continue
 to
 work


at
 problems
 even
 when
 they're
 not
 making


headway
 is
 the
 sign
 of
 a
 good


entrepreneur.
 There's
 a
 level
 of


stubbornness
 there
 which
 really
 is


important
 in
 taking
 on
 big
 problems.


That
 problem
 solving
 mentality
 and
 that


ability
 to
 continue
 to
 work
 even
 though


there's
 no
 progress.
 I
 think
 that's
 one


of the
 things
 that
 makes
 good
 founders.


And
 so
 our
 job
 is
 to
 really
 find
 great


founders
 who
 are
 solving
 significant


problems.
 And
 if
 you
 find
 those
 people,


generally
 you
 can
 usually
 find
 people


who
 want
 to
 give
 them
 money
 to
 solve


those
 problems.
 That's
 really
 what


you're
 doing
 as
 an
 investor.
 You're


finding
 money
 and
 you're
 finding
 smart


people
 and
 you're
 bringing
 them


together.
 Being
 a
 founder
 is
 a
 really


hard
 job.
 It's
 an
 exceptionally
 hard
 job


and
 you
 have
 to
 have
 that
 ability
 to


wake
 up
 every
 day
 and
 want
 to
 take
 on


and
 solve
 a
 difficult
 problem.
 And
 so
 I


think
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 find
 rewarding
 is


every
 time
 I
 work
 with
 a
 founder
 and
 I'm


able
 to
 help
 them
 go
 that
 little
 bit


farther
 on
 their
 journey,
 that's


rewarding
 for
 me.
