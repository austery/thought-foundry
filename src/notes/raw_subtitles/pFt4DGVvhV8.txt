And
 I
 have
 a
 long
 list
 of
 questions,
 but


I
 think
 I'll
 try
 to
 just
 boil
 it
 down
 to


one
 main
 question
 because
 you've
 both
 um


told
 us
 what
 is
 needed
 and
 we
 know
 what


is
 needed
 and
 we
 know
 that
 we
 are
 going


in
 the
 right
 direction
 both
 in
 Europe


not
 that
 much
 in
 US
 but
 it
 is
 limited


how
 much
 damage
 Trump
 can
 do


>> but
 we
 need
 to
 speed
 up.
 So
 what
 should


we
 do
 to
 speed
 up?
 Madame
 Laglet,
 first


>> allow
 me
 to
 look
 at
 it
 from
 my
 my


limited
 angle
 which
 is
 that
 of
 a
 of
 a


central
 banker
 and
 one
 concerned
 about


the
 movement
 of
 capital
 in
 the
 in
 the
 in


the
 European
 Union
 which
 was
 one
 of
 the


four
 freedom
 of
 circulation
 that
 was


agreed
 between
 all
 the
 European


partners.
 We
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 that


private
 sector
 money
 I
 mean
 Al
 was
 very


eloquent
 in
 saying
 what
 is
 it
 90%
 of
 85%


of
 the
 necessary
 investment
 was
 financed


by
 the
 private
 sector.
 Private
 sector


has
 to
 feel
 confident
 and
 encouraged
 in


investing
 in
 those
 elements
 of
 the


transition
 and
 they're
 not
 just
 you
 know


narrowmindedly


defined.
 There's
 a
 whole
 range
 of


sectors
 that
 have
 to
 benefit
 from
 the


transition.
 So
 policy
 makers
 have
 to


facilitate
 that
 accelerate
 it
 as
 much
 as


possible.
 I
 think
 that
 as
 sort
 of
 cherry


on
 the
 cakes
 which
 would
 not
 be
 uh


irrelevant
 is
 making
 sure
 that
 there
 is


the
 right
 taxation
 in
 the
 place
 where


you
 want
 to
 encourage
 or
 discourage.
 So


I
 referred
 in
 my
 speech
 to
 you
 know


taxing
 alternative
 sources
 rather
 than


electricity
 sources.
 I
 would
 say
 that


encouraging
 equity
 investment
 rather


than
 debt
 would
 also
 be
 necessary
 in


order
 to
 you
 know
 have
 stable
 and


longerterm
 investment
 which
 is
 needed
 in


in
 the
 green
 uh
 sector.
 So
 on
 in
 from
 my


corner
 I
 think
 accelerating
 speeding
 up


simplifying
 access
 to
 from
 private


capital
 to
 a
 market
 where
 green


investment
 are
 encouraged
 by
 uh
 the


fiscal
 side
 would
 be
 would
 be
 first


priority
 together
 with
 you
 know
 in
 terms


of
 where
 the
 money
 is
 invested.
 I
 would


repeat
 grids,
 grids,
 grids
 in
 order
 to


address
 the
 cost
 that
 can
 be
 reduced.


>> Let
 let
 me
 uh
 endorse
 uh
 uh
 President


Lagard's
 comment
 about
 the
 priority
 that


should
 be
 assigned
 to
 improving
 the


grids.
 Um
 this
 is
 true
 in
 almost
 every


country.
 When
 the
 millennium
 turned
 uh
 a


few
 years
 ago,
 the
 National
 Academy
 of


Engineering
 in
 the
 United
 States


conducted
 a
 survey
 to
 identify
 the


number
 one
 engineering
 achievement
 of


the
 20th
 century.
 And
 the
 answer
 was


America's
 electricity
 grid.
 But
 only
 a


few
 years
 later,
 it
 became
 apparent
 that


the
 key
 part
 of
 that
 phrase
 was
 in
 the


20th
 century


because
 it's
 no
 longer
 a
 one-way


transmission.
 It
 is
 a
 a
 two-way
 and


multi-way
 transition
 with
 grid
 storage


uh
 widely
 distributed
 throughout
 the


grid
 requires
 a
 lot
 of
 software.
 It


requires
 a
 lot
 of
 innovation.


I
 think
 this
 is
 going
 on
 in
 in
 the


United
 States
 in
 spite
 of
 Trump.
 There's


a
 boom
 in
 renewable
 energy
 investment


right
 now
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Some
 of


it
 is
 driven
 by
 the
 uh
 prospective
 uh


retirement
 of
 certain
 incentives
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 year,
 but
 it's
 mainly
 driven


by
 the
 economic
 superiority
 of
 these


sources.
 And
 may
 I
 remind
 you
 that
 when


Donald
 Trump
 was
 president
 for
 four


years,
 the
 first
 time
 around,
 what


happened
 during
 those
 four
 years?
 Um,


solar
 energy
 doubled,
 electric
 car
 sales


doubled,
 clean
 energy
 investment


tripled,
 coal
 use
 declined
 by
 more
 than


20%.
 Why?
 Because
 the
 economic
 realities


are
 favoring
 this
 energy
 transition.
 If


I
 could
 give
 you
 a
 visual
 metaphor
 that


to
 me
 describes
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the


world
 and
 in
 the
 US,
 there's
 a
 big
 wheel


turning
 in
 the
 right
 direction
 and


little
 wheels
 within
 it
 turning
 in
 the


opposite
 direction.
 But
 even
 those


little
 wheels
 are
 being
 moved
 inexraably


toward
 where
 we're
 going.
 We're
 not


moving
 fast
 enough.
 We
 have
 to


accelerate.
 How
 do
 we
 do
 it?


In
 order
 to
 solve
 the
 climate
 crisis,
 we


have
 to
 pay
 attention
 to
 the
 democracy


crisis.
 Christine
 mentioned
 that
 nine


out
 of
 10
 Europeans
 are
 in
 favor
 of


ramping
 up
 investments
 in
 renewable


energy.
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 percentage
 is


quite
 that
 high
 in
 the
 US,
 but
 it's


close
 to
 that
 in
 the
 US.


uh
 and
 yet
 the
 political
 power
 and
 the


legacy
 political
 and
 economic
 networks


of
 the
 fossil
 fuel
 industry
 have
 been


used
 very
 skillfully
 to
 slow
 this


transition
 down.
 Uh
 and
 at
 the
 I


mentioned
 the
 big
 changes
 with
 the


pandemic
 and
 and
 and
 with
 the
 China
 WTO


the
 invasion
 of
 Ukraine
 and
 all
 of
 that.


There's
 another
 transition
 that's
 we've


been
 wrestling
 with
 and
 that
 is
 a


radical
 transition
 in
 the
 information


ecosystem
 within
 which
 we
 make


collective
 decisions.
 Norway
 and
 the


United
 States
 formed
 our
 institutions


during
 the
 era
 of
 the
 printing
 press
 and


we
 cycled
 through
 broadcasting
 which
 is


totalitarianfriendly
 to
 the
 internet
 and


now
 social
 media
 with
 an
 overlay
 of
 AI


coming
 rapidly
 and
 as
 a
 result
 the
 the


norms
 and
 practices
 of
 representative


democracy
 have
 been
 turned
 upside
 down


and
 they're
 not
 working
 as
 well
 as
 they


should.
 I
 do
 believe
 that
 change
 is


coming
 and
 I
 believe
 in
 the
 elections


one
 year
 from
 next
 month
 we
 will
 see


almost
 certainly
 we
 will
 see
 a
 dramatic


change
 in
 the
 direction
 of
 the
 Congress


in
 the
 United
 States.


>> Yes,
 let's
 hope
 so.
 I
 dare
 to
 say.
 Uh


Madame
 Lagards,
 uh


>> did
 you
 allow
 me
 to
 make
 a
 suggestion


here?


>> Absolutely.


>> Because
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 many
 of
 you


in
 this
 room
 have
 seen
 a
 film
 called
 The


Inconvenient
 Truth.
 raise
 hands.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.


Point
 made.
 At
 times
 when
 films
 were


actually
 very
 powerful,


>> one
 person
 sitting
 next
 to
 me
 was
 the


agent
 for
 change.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 what


it
 was
 for
 you.
 For
 me,
 it
 was
 a


dramatic
 understanding
 of
 what
 was
 going


to
 happen.


And
 I
 would
 suggest
 that
 with
 that
 same


person
 sitting
 next
 to
 me,
 we
 should


encourage
 him
 and
 maybe
 fund
 him.


There's
 a
 bit
 of
 money
 around
 here


to
 produce
 on
 the
 media
 of
 the
 future.


something
 that
 could
 be
 called,
 I
 don't


know,
 the
 inconvenient
 comfort
 zone
 that


we
 are
 in
 and
 or
 something
 like
 that
 in


order
 to
 encourage
 as
 many
 young
 people


because
 we're
 all
 a
 little
 bit
 over
 the


edge
 of
 the
 20s
 uh
 in
 this
 room,
 but


encourage
 them
 to
 appreciate
 what
 is


needed,
 how
 much
 money
 will
 be
 required,


and
 how
 they
 should
 prepare
 for
 that.


>> Wouldn't
 you
 agree?
 Yes.
 Yeah.


Well,
 as
 I
 often
 say,
 if
 it
 hadn't
 been


for
 me,
 we
 might
 have
 a
 big
 problem


right
 now.


>> Yes.


>> But
 I'm
 not
 done
 yet.


>> You're
 not
 done
 yet.
 But
 should
 we
 move


back
 to
 to
 the
 European
 country?
 No.
 No.


Please.
 Uh
 and
 uh
 because
 um
 climate


initiatives
 are
 competing
 with
 many


other
 uh
 important
 tasks.
 For
 instance,


we
 have
 to
 increase
 our
 defense
 budget.


we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 challenges.
 Uh


how
 should
 we
 how
 should
 we
 try
 to
 to


combine
 climate
 initiatives
 with
 all
 the


other
 tasks
 that
 we
 have
 to
 address?


>> I
 hope
 it
 was
 clear
 in
 my
 in
 my
 remarks


that
 we
 have
 to
 act
 together
 and
 the


togetherness
 for
 me
 is
 Europe
 and
 the


European
 friends
 around
 us.
 And
 I
 think


that
 when
 there
 is
 a
 threat
 as
 obvious,


as
 imminent,
 and
 as
 longasting
 as


climate
 change,
 it
 really
 warrants
 a


joint
 approach.


So
 fiscal
 space
 is
 limited
 for
 some


countries
 as
 we
 know.
 Other
 countries


have
 a
 larger
 balance
 sheets
 and
 are
 are


putting
 the
 balance
 sheet
 uh
 in
 the


equation.
 But
 it's
 really
 one
 of
 those


areas,
 the
 two
 or
 three
 that
 I
 think
 my


perspective
 are
 unquestionable.
 Defense


is
 one,
 climate
 change
 is
 the
 other
 one


that
 warrant
 joint
 commitment,
 joint


initiative,
 joint
 funding
 in
 order
 to


respond
 to
 the
 urgency
 of
 the
 matter.


And
 as
 Al
 Gore
 was
 saying
 earlier
 on,


85%
 is
 private
 sector,
 15%
 was
 the


incentive
 or
 the
 environment
 within


which
 policy
 makers
 could
 make
 a


difference.
 So
 we're
 not
 talking
 about


the
 entire
 financing
 needs
 being


supported
 by
 governments
 because
 number


one,
 they
 cannot
 do
 it.
 Number
 two,


private
 sector
 must
 play
 its
 part
 as


well
 and
 will
 bring
 a
 level
 of


discipline
 and
 scrutiny
 to
 the
 projects


which
 is
 which
 are
 which
 are
 needed.
 So


that
 would
 be
 my
 response
 to
 you.
 It's
 a


joint
 effort
 massively
 from
 the
 private


sector
 in
 a
 smaller
 proportion
 by
 the


public
 sector
 but
 one
 where
 joint
 effort


is
 completely
 warranted
 and
 necessary.


But
 we
 will
 be
 dependent
 on
 a
 lot
 of


import
 from
 China
 and
 we
 try
 to
 be
 more


independent
 of
 Russia.
 So
 are
 we
 just


swapping
 the
 the
 dependence
 of
 Russia


with
 dependence
 on
 China?


>> Look,
 if
 there
 is
 one
 lesson
 that
 we


learned
 in
 the
 last
 few
 years
 is
 to
 be


more
 s
 more
 security,
 sustainability,


affordability.
 All
 of
 that
 applies
 as


well
 to
 the
 uh
 the
 supply
 chain
 and
 the


sourcing
 of
 the
 components.
 It's
 obvious


at
 the
 moment
 that
 about
 95%
 of
 the


solar
 uh
 generation
 u
 various
 components


including
 rare
 earth
 by
 the
 way
 that
 are


needed
 for
 for
 some
 of
 that
 are
 in
 the


hands
 of
 China.
 But
 we
 have
 to
 respond


to
 that
 and
 there
 is
 a
 strategy
 that
 has


been
 developed
 by
 the
 European


Commission
 which
 addresses
 precisely
 the


issue
 of
 rare
 earth
 in
 order
 to
 reach


certain
 targets
 of
 independence.
 It's


going
 to
 take
 a
 while
 uh
 just
 as
 it
 will


in
 relation
 to
 defense.
 But
 we
 we
 have


to
 to
 take
 that
 path
 and
 to
 and
 to


travel
 that
 journey.


>> Let
 me
 offer
 two
 pathways
 to
 consider.


Uh
 you
 ran
 the
 IMF
 brilliantly
 Christine


uh
 and
 you
 study
 started
 then
 and


Cristina
 Georgva
 has
 recently
 released
 a


new
 version
 of
 the
 study.
 What
 would


happen
 if
 governments
 eliminated
 the


subsidies
 for
 fossil
 fuels?
 Many
 people


are
 surprised
 to
 dig
 down
 into
 the


realities
 and
 realize
 that
 taxpayers


around
 the
 world
 are
 forced
 to
 subsidize


the
 destruction
 of
 humanity's
 future.


It's
 literally
 insane.
 The
 IMF
 study


shows
 that
 if
 we
 eliminated
 subsidies


for
 fossil
 fuel,
 governments
 around
 the


world
 would
 have
 an
 extra
 $4.4
 trillion


dollar
 to
 spend.
 that
 happens
 to
 be
 just


about
 exactly
 the
 amount
 that
 the
 IEA


says
 is
 needed
 to
 finance
 the
 energy


transition.
 So
 when
 people
 say
 where's


the
 money
 going
 to
 come
 from?
 Well,
 if


we
 stopped
 spending
 it
 subsidizing
 the


destruction
 of
 our
 future
 and
 used
 it


for
 good
 results
 instead,
 we'd
 be
 done


where
 the
 money
 I
 is
 concerned.
 a
 second


pathway
 forward
 if
 I
 could.
 President


Lula,
 who
 is
 hosting,
 of
 course,
 COP
 30


next
 month,
 uh
 has
 recently
 ventured


this
 proposal
 for
 a
 an
 alliance
 of


countries
 that
 support
 the
 carbon
 border


adjustment
 mechanisms,
 the
 C-bams,
 if


China
 and
 the
 European
 Union,
 including


Norway,
 Singapore,
 Australia,
 all


combined
 with
 a
 border
 adjustment
 to


reflect
 the
 carbon
 content,
 then
 that


might
 even
 match
 uh
 President
 Trump's


fondness
 for
 tariffs
 uh
 such
 as
 it
 is
 uh


and
 we
 could
 finally
 in
 in
 that
 indirect


way
 put
 a
 price
 on
 carbon.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 They
 tell
 me
 we
 have


to
 stop.
 I
 can
 see
 that
 the
 audience
 is


more
 optimistic
 now
 than
 when
 we
 met


this
 morning
 and
 that
 is
 because
 of
 you.


You
 are
 very
 experienced
 people.
 you


have
 been
 working
 on
 this
 for
 decades


and
 uh
 we
 knew
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 easy
 to
 uh


you
 know
 form
 that
 such
 a
 big


transformation


>> but
 we
 just
 have
 to


>> carry
 on


>> carry
 on.


>> Can
 I
 make
 one
 more
 comment?
 I
 I
 know


that
 you're
 in
 Norway
 you're
 much
 more


punctual
 than
 we
 are
 in
 the
 United


States.
 I
 know
 you're
 getting
 the


signal.
 Yeah,


>> I
 had
 a


>> I
 had
 a
 teacher
 when
 I
 was
 young


who
 said
 frequently
 that
 we
 all
 face
 the


same
 choice
 in
 life
 over
 and
 over
 again.


And
 it's
 a
 choice
 between
 the
 hard
 right


and
 the
 easy
 wrong.
 We
 have
 now
 reached


a
 point
 in
 the
 evolution
 of
 human


society
 where
 we
 face
 that
 choice


between
 the
 hard
 right
 and
 the
 easy


wrong.
 People
 say
 we
 face
 a
 poly
 crisis.


We
 have
 a
 poly
 solution.
 We
 need
 to
 make


the
 hard
 right
 decision
 to
 vastly


accelerate
 the
 transition
 away
 from


fossil
 fuels
 and
 build
 confidence
 that


we
 can
 control
 our
 own
 destiny.
 I
 want


young
 people
 to
 have
 the
 same


hopefulness
 in
 looking
 at
 the
 future


that
 I
 had
 when
 I
 was
 young.
 How
 dare
 we


not
 give
 that
 to
 them
 when
 we
 know
 that


we
 can.
 We
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 do
 it.


Norway
 has
 been
 leading
 the
 way
 in
 the


right
 making
 the
 right
 decisions.
 We
 can


choose
 the
 hard
 right
 and
 save
 our


future
 and
 thank
 you
 so
 much.
