It
 has
 never
 been
 easier
 to
 launch
 apps.


People
 who
 couldn't
 write
 a
 single
 line


of
 code
 six
 months
 ago
 are
 now
 launching


AI
 apps
 and
 raising
 VC
 rounds.
 But
 when


you
 look
 under
 the
 hood
 at
 the
 actual


economics
 of
 those
 apps,
 the
 picture


changes
 dramatically.
 So,
 is
 AI
 software


business
 worth
 it?
 If
 you
 strip
 away


investor
 pitches
 and
 VC
 rounds,
 let's


talk
 about
 the
 economics
 of
 AI
 software


apps
 and
 why
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 them


are
 bad
 businesses.
 Episode
 six
 of
 my


series
 AI
 hype
 versus
 reality.
 Let's


dive
 in.
 Before
 we
 talk
 about
 the


numbers,
 here
 is
 what
 you
 need
 to
 know


about
 margins.
 Look
 at
 this
 picture.


This
 pretty
 much
 sums
 it
 up.
 Now,


traditional
 B2B
 margins
 range
 between
 70


and
 90%.
 With
 best-in-class
 SAS


applications
 achieving
 around
 80%
 or


higher.
 This
 is
 because
 software


businesses
 are
 highly
 scalable
 and
 the


marginal
 cost
 to
 serve
 each
 additional


customer
 once
 a
 platform
 is
 built
 is


near
 zero.
 Remember
 the
 video
 about
 tech


sales
 where
 I
 was
 telling
 you
 that
 tech


sales
 is
 a
 fantastic
 job
 if
 you
 can't
 do


sales
 because
 there
 is
 no
 inventory
 or


no
 physical
 product.
 Now
 that's
 exactly


the
 reason
 why
 software
 is
 so
 scalable.


Now
 the
 cost
 of
 acquisition
 of
 each
 new


client
 can
 be
 different
 depending
 on
 the


product
 and
 depending
 on
 the
 business.


On
 average,
 if
 we
 take
 for
 example


Shopify
 and
 you
 come
 to
 them
 as
 a


customer
 and
 you
 want
 to
 do
 business


with
 them
 and
 use
 their
 platform,
 when


you
 go
 and
 sign
 up,
 it
 costs
 almost


nothing
 for
 Shopify
 to
 have
 you
 as
 a


client.
 Any
 additional
 cost
 to
 serve
 you


is
 well
 covered
 by
 the
 amount
 of
 money


that
 you're
 going
 to
 pay
 Shopify.
 Now,


let's
 talk
 about
 AI
 native
 SAS.
 Here's


the
 data.
 30
 to
 60%
 margin
 at
 best.


Genai
 native
 SAS
 and
 especially
 LLM


rappers
 which
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 them


are
 have
 30
 to
 60%
 margins
 with
 60
 being


best-in-class
 products.
 Now
 even
 the


most
 mature
 GI
 products
 like
 Anthropics


Claude
 are
 at
 55%.
 Listen
 to
 this
 one


more
 time.
 Best-in-class
 is
 55%.


Now
 there's
 also
 evidence
 that
 the


products
 sitting
 in
 the
 upper
 range
 of


margins
 tend
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 dead
 subs.


Now
 what
 are
 dead
 subscriptions?
 A
 dead


sub
 is
 when
 a
 user
 is
 paying
 but
 not


using.
 And
 this
 specifically
 applies
 to


those
 cases
 when
 you
 guys
 purchase


access
 in
 bundles.
 I
 don't
 know if


you've
 come
 across
 those
 videos
 on


Instagram.
 I
 see
 them
 all
 the
 time
 where


they
 sell
 you
 a
 bundle
 of
 AI
 tools.
 AI


tools
 for
 content
 creators,
 for
 product


managers,
 for
 data
 folks,
 you
 get
 the


idea.
 Genai
 products
 are
 still
 riding


that
 wave
 of
 hype,
 allowing
 companies
 to


get
 some
 revenue
 through
 dead
 subs.
 But


this
 is
 not
 going
 to
 last
 long.
 One
 more


thing.
 Remember
 this
 old
 video
 when
 I


was
 sharing
 my
 thoughts
 on
 how
 to
 pick
 a


career
 in
 tech
 that
 lasts.
 I
 want
 to


bring
 you
 back
 to
 the
 concept
 of
 the


hype
 cycle
 one
 more
 time.
 Now
 this
 is


where
 Genai
 is
 at
 the
 moment.
 It
 is
 very


common
 among
 tech
 trends
 that
 are


reaching
 the
 peak
 of
 the
 hype
 cycle.
 But


sitting
 at
 the
 peak
 of
 the
 cycle
 has


absolutely
 zero
 correlation
 with


long-term
 benefits.
 For
 instance,
 let's


look
 at
 the
 blockchain
 trend
 by
 my


favorite
 example.
 Remember
 how


revolutionary
 it
 all
 sounded
 back
 when


cryptocurrencies
 became
 a
 thing?
 But


when
 you
 really
 dig
 into
 use
 cases


around
 blockchain,
 there
 aren't
 that


many
 things
 that
 need
 to
 be
 solved
 with


blockchain
 and
 the
 ones
 that
 cannot
 be


solved
 in
 any
 other
 way.
 Same
 thing
 with


augmented
 reality,
 for
 example.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 it's
 an
 unpopular
 opinion,
 but


really
 there
 aren't
 that
 many
 use
 cases


outside
 of
 entertainment
 that
 are
 truly


monetizable
 when
 built
 on
 AR.
 Can


software
 companies
 stay
 afloat
 for
 many


years
 despite
 being
 unprofitable?
 Yes,


and
 there
 are
 numerous
 examples.
 Asana


sustained
 years
 of
 losses
 while


continuing
 to
 operate
 and
 grow.


Monday.com
 has
 been
 on
 a
 continued


unprofitable
 streak.
 Marquetto
 lost
 36


out
 of
 60
 million
 in
 cash
 when
 filing


for
 an
 IPO
 and
 numerous
 losses
 while


still
 expanding.
 And
 this
 strategy
 works


and
 it
 works
 more
 or
 less
 okay
 when
 it's


a
 B2B
 and
 not
 AI
 native
 product.
 But


with
 pure
 genai,
 the
 unit
 economics
 and


the
 profitability
 path
 is
 entirely


different.
 So
 we
 can't
 and
 shouldn't


compare
 it
 to
 the
 traditional
 business


models
 of
 SAS.
 Now
 why
 is
 there
 such
 a


stark
 margin
 difference?
 In
 traditional


SAS
 after
 initial
 R&D
 and
 platform


investment
 serving
 more
 customers
 adds


very
 little
 extra
 cost.
 In
 Gai
 native
 or


GPT
 wrapper
 products
 there
 are
 major


ongoing
 costs
 per
 user
 API
 calls
 compute


time
 licensing
 sometimes
 per
 output


moderation.
 Once
 again
 in
 traditional


SAS
 when
 you
 acquire
 a
 new
 customer
 and


in
 B2B's
 case
 the
 customer
 is
 a
 team
 of


people
 that
 you
 on
 board
 onto
 your


product
 the
 biggest
 cost
 for
 the


business
 is
 almost
 always
 service


related
 a
 dedicated
 CSM
 support


specialist
 sometimes
 implementation
 or


delivery
 manager
 point
 is
 those
 are


services
 and
 those
 services
 are
 not


being
 used
 consistently
 in
 Genai
 native


products
 costs
 are
 not
 only
 rising
 they


can
 even
 become
 exponential
 so
 the


companies
 have
 to
 cap
 usage
 to
 at
 least


somehow
 make
 those
 ends
 meet
 for
 example


Chad
 GPT
 cost
 OpenAI
 $700,000
 a
 day
 in


2023.
 Now,
 the
 cost
 did
 go
 down
 and
 this


year
 the
 sources
 site
 a
 range
 starting


$100,000
 to
 several
 hundred,000
 per
 day


depending
 on
 usage
 and
 models.
 But


multiply
 this
 across
 multiple
 users
 or


particularly
 prolific
 AI
 super
 users
 and


users
 can
 individually
 cost
 OpenAI
 more


than
 $200
 a
 month
 which
 is
 one
 of the


most
 expensive
 plans.
 OpenAI
 had
 to


meter
 usage
 even
 at
 premium
 tiers


because
 the
 cost
 per
 user
 could
 easily


surpass
 revenue.
 Another
 example,
 GitHub


Copilot
 launched
 at
 $10
 a
 month,
 but


it's
 been
 widely
 reported
 that
 the
 cost


of
 a
 user
 for
 Microsoft
 was
 almost
 $30
 a


month
 to
 serve,
 meaning
 they
 were
 losing


money
 per
 each
 active
 user.
 And
 shortly


after
 they
 estimated
 that
 the
 cost
 for


power
 users
 were
 actually
 around
 $80
 per


developer
 per
 month.
 And
 lastly,


midjourney,
 they
 did
 offer
 a
 lowcost


plan,
 but
 they
 had
 a
 very
 strict
 limit


to
 how
 many
 images
 you
 could
 generate.


And
 that
 was
 because
 each
 image
 consumes


significant
 GPU
 resources.
 And
 the
 funny


thing
 is
 that
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it,
 we


as
 users
 get
 used
 to
 this
 all
 you
 can


eat
 usage
 behavior
 that
 when
 we
 hit


those
 limits
 and
 we
 are
 on
 a
 paid
 plan,


we
 go,
 "Okay,
 I'm
 not
 paying
 for
 this."


I
 personally
 had
 a
 majour
 subscription
 a


couple
 of
 years
 ago
 and
 I
 canceled
 it


within
 a
 few
 months.
 But
 this
 payw


walling
 is
 necessary
 to
 prevent
 runaway


costs
 from
 a
 small
 set
 of
 very
 heavy


users.
 So
 on
 the
 surface
 it's
 all


software
 but
 in
 Genai
 costs
 for
 the


company
 who
 run
 the
 business
 become


exponential
 especially
 when
 they
 offer


the
 all
 you
 can
 eat
 or
 unmetered
 fixed


rate
 plans.
 If
 a
 GPT
 rapper
 startup
 puts


a
 low
 price
 on
 AI
 usage
 or
 offers
 a


beefy
 premium
 and
 doesn't
 limit


expensive
 features,
 a
 minority
 of
 users


can
 generate
 costs
 that
 will
 scale


exponentially.
 But
 the
 paradox
 is
 that


when
 they
 do
 put
 in
 usage
 controls,
 the


users
 don't
 like
 the
 experience.
 So
 how


do
 AI
 companies
 make
 money
 and
 do
 they


make
 money
 if
 you
 strip
 away
 VC
 funds?


Let's
 play
 product
 management
 101,
 shall


we?
 As
 of
 August
 2025,
 it
 is
 reported


that
 Chad
 GPT
 has
 approximately
 700


million
 total
 user
 base.
 Now,
 different


reports
 show
 different
 numbers,
 but
 all


of
 them
 agree
 that
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


year,
 they're
 expecting
 to
 reach
 1


billion
 users,
 which
 leads
 me
 to
 believe


that
 they're
 at
 approximately
 7
 to
 800


million
 users
 right
 now.
 Now,
 of
 those
 7


to
 800
 million
 users,
 how
 many
 of
 them


are
 paid?
 10
 million
 on
 Chad
 GPT
 plus


plan.
 Now,
 I
 did
 the
 math
 for
 you
 and


that's
 less
 than
 a
 2%
 conversion.
 If


you're
 a
 PM
 or
 a
 founder
 listening
 to


this,
 I
 would
 love
 to
 hear
 your
 thoughts


on
 this
 conversion
 ratio.
 But
 let
 me


tell
 you,
 when
 I
 hear
 2%
 conversion
 to


paid,
 my
 eyebrows
 get
 raised,
 especially


when
 we're
 talking
 about
 a
 worldwide


disruption.
 This
 is
 alarmingly
 low.
 In


product
 management
 terms,
 your
 PMF
 goes


out
 the
 window
 or
 you
 never
 had
 it
 in


the
 first
 place.
 So,
 how
 is
 it
 possible


that
 one
 of
 the
 most
 visited
 websites
 in


the
 world,
 a
 major
 widely
 recognized


disruptor,
 has
 less
 than
 2%
 conversion


rate?
 To
 be
 clear,
 I
 have
 found
 sources


that
 show
 five
 or
 six
 or
 7%
 conversion,


but
 honestly,
 if
 you
 do
 the
 math,
 it


should
 be
 less
 than
 that.
 I
 truly
 don't


know
 where
 they
 got
 that
 number
 from.


But
 if
 you
 want
 to
 correct
 me
 and
 it's


truly
 five
 or
 six
 or
 7%,
 let
 me
 know.


But
 even
 with
 that
 number,
 a
 7%


conversion
 for
 a
 major
 disruptor
 is


alarmingly
 low.
 Moving
 on,
 in
 December


last
 year,
 OpenAI
 published
 the


following
 numbers.
 300
 million
 weekly


active
 users
 and
 then
 the
 number
 went
 up


to
 400
 a
 month
 later.
 Does
 anyone
 notice


anything
 unusual?
 Weekly.
 Why
 weekly?


Why
 not
 monthly?
 Monthly
 is
 a
 much
 more


common
 SAS
 metric
 than
 weekly.


Nevertheless,
 they
 chose
 to
 go
 with


weekly.
 One
 more
 thing,
 weekly
 active


users
 went
 up
 100
 million,
 but
 the
 site


traffic
 hasn't
 changed.
 How
 is
 that


possible?
 Personally,
 I
 think
 that's


getting
 a
 little
 bit
 into
 the
 territory


of
 vanity
 metrics.
 It's
 a
 nice
 big
 round


number
 that
 you
 can
 show
 to
 the
 whole


world,
 but
 does
 it
 really
 translate
 to


revenue?
 And
 last,
 but
 not
 least,
 the


API
 revenue
 data.
 This
 is
 not
 official


data
 published
 by
 OpenAI,
 but
 if
 you


believe
 the
 research
 that
 this
 company


did,
 it
 becomes
 pretty
 obvious
 that
 AI


is
 not
 going
 to
 replace
 us
 all.
 At least


not
 right
 now.
 And
 now
 to
 put
 this
 in


perspective,
 let's
 look
 at
 OpenAI's


biggest
 competitors.
 monthly
 active


users,
 Chad
 GBT
 3
 to
 400
 million.
 Its


main
 competitor
 Claude
 just
 3
 million.


Gemini
 47,
 but
 that
 is
 heavily
 boosted


by
 Google's
 reach.
 And
 Copilot
 33


million,
 which
 is
 again
 boosted
 by


Microsoft's
 reach.
 Let
 those
 numbers


sink
 in.
 The
 Chad
 GPT,
 one
 of
 the
 most


visited
 websites
 on
 the
 planet,
 has
 more


than
 93%
 of
 users
 on
 a
 free
 plan.


depending
 whose
 conversion
 numbers
 you


believe.
 And
 this
 means
 that
 every
 free


user
 generates
 losses
 for
 OpenAI
 because


the
 computing
 costs
 are
 still
 spent.
 And


let
 me
 remind
 you
 that
 Chad
 GBT
 is
 the


absolute
 leader
 of
 Genai
 products,
 the


top
 of
 the
 pyramid.
 The
 difference
 in


market
 share
 between
 Chad
 GBT
 and


Claude,
 its
 biggest
 competitor,
 is
 a


factor
 of
 100.
 If
 you
 assess
 Chad
 GBT
 as


a
 product
 purely
 by
 looking
 at
 the


numbers,
 forget
 that
 it's
 OpenAI,
 it's


actually
 doing
 worse
 than
 an
 average
 SAS


product.
 Do
 you
 see
 what
 I'm
 getting
 at?


This
 is
 why
 I'm
 saying
 that
 traditional


SAS
 metrics
 don't
 work
 with
 Genai
 native


products.
 This
 is
 why
 I'm
 trying
 to


prove
 that
 as
 disruptive
 and
 as


mind-blowing
 as
 AI
 seems,
 we're
 so
 early


in
 the
 real
 adoption
 cycle.
 And
 when
 you


start
 seeing
 those
 metrics,
 it
 becomes


pretty
 evident
 that
 LLMs
 have
 reached


their
 peak.
 Sure,
 models
 get
 better.


They
 code
 better.
 The
 error
 rate
 is


lower.
 They
 meet
 higher
 benchmarks.
 But


it's
 almost
 like
 the
 invention
 of
 a
 car.


Sure,
 we
 have
 Teslas.
 We
 have
 Bugattis.


We
 have
 Hondas
 and
 Fords.
 Better
 or


worse,
 faster
 or
 slow,
 electric
 or
 gas,


it's
 a
 car.
 It's
 not
 becoming
 a


teleportation
 machine.
 All
 of
 these


products
 essentially
 deliver
 the
 same


value.
 It's
 clear
 that
 Chad
 GBT's
 reach


is
 driven
 largely
 by
 media
 hype
 and
 much


less
 by
 actual
 product
 value.
 The


economics
 of
 foundational
 AI
 companies


like
 OpenAI
 or
 Anthropic
 are
 royally


unprofitable
 and
 the
 way
 they
 exist


today.
 Their
 business
 models
 are


extremely
 unsustainable.
 And
 now
 that


we're
 moving
 into
 the
 age
 where
 LLM


becomes
 a
 commodity,
 we
 will
 be
 seeing


drastic
 changes
 in
 their
 pricing,


bundling,
 and
 growth
 strategies
 as
 a


whole
 because
 they
 have
 to
 maintain
 the


market
 share.
 So,
 right
 now,
 we're


witnessing
 a
 rat
 race
 on
 the
 way
 to


profits.
 Now,
 don't
 get
 me
 wrong.
 Those


companies
 that
 are
 building
 foundational


models
 are
 not
 typical
 AI
 businesses.


And
 I'm
 not
 bashing
 them
 by
 any
 means.


The
 revolution
 that
 they're
 making,
 the


groundbreaking
 progress
 that
 they're


bringing
 to
 this
 world
 is
 something
 that


requires
 very
 heavy
 investment
 even


though
 it's
 not
 pumping
 out
 money
 right


away.
 So,
 yes,
 I'm
 using
 their
 metrics


because
 their
 metrics
 are
 first
 of
 all


available.
 Secondly,
 those
 are
 the


biggest
 AI
 products
 on
 the
 planet.
 So,


it's
 easy
 to
 use
 them
 as
 benchmarks.
 But


I
 want
 to
 be
 very
 clear.
 I
 am
 aware
 that


companies
 like
 OpenAI
 should
 not
 be


judged
 based
 on
 their
 VC
 rounds.


Companies
 like
 them
 should
 be
 racing


because
 their
 technology
 is
 what


everything
 else
 is
 built
 upon.
 The
 point


I'm
 making
 in
 this
 video
 is
 that
 there


are
 four,
 five
 or
 10
 companies
 like


OpenAI.
 Everybody
 else
 who
 keeps
 raising


rounds
 are
 not
 OpenAI.
 Let's
 talk
 about


the
 AI
 price
 wars.
 The
 AI
 SAS
 space
 is


experiencing
 rapid
 price
 wars,
 further


squeezing
 margins
 as
 much
 as
 possible,


especially
 for
 rappers
 and
 tools
 layered


on
 top
 of
 foundational
 models.
 I
 suppose


AI
 companies
 will
 be
 expanding
 their


product
 lines
 to
 try
 and
 upsell
 users


more
 aggressively
 because
 they
 have
 to


make
 those
 ends
 meet.
 And
 as
 the
 hype


and
 that
 initial
 fascination
 keeps


wearing
 off,
 companies
 and
 investors


start
 paying
 much
 closer
 attention
 to


the
 economics
 of
 AI
 apps.
 How
 to
 price


AI
 software
 so
 it
 becomes
 profitable
 is


a
 very
 difficult
 question.
 Claude
 is


doing
 a
 really
 smart
 thing
 in
 my


opinion.
 I
 love
 the
 sonnet
 family
 of


models
 and
 when
 I
 was
 in
 the
 free
 plan


they
 gave
 me
 just
 enough
 to
 test
 it
 out


but
 then
 they
 put
 in
 those
 query
 limits


and
 they
 renew
 every
 few
 days.
 So
 the


experience
 is
 good
 enough
 for
 you
 to
 get


the
 value
 and
 annoying
 enough
 to
 make


you
 upgrade
 if
 you're
 a
 savvy
 AI
 user.


Now
 B2B
 AI
 apps
 often
 price
 depending
 on


the
 impact
 that
 it
 creates.
 So
 in
 a


nutshell,
 everybody's
 trying
 to


experiment
 and
 come
 up
 with
 a
 working


model,
 but
 on
 average,
 the
 profitability


of
 a
 genai
 native
 software
 is
 very
 far


from
 traditional
 B2B
 or
 even
 B2C
 SAS.
 So


after
 hearing
 all
 of
 this,
 let's
 think


about
 how
 we
 can
 tell
 which
 AI
 SAS


business
 can
 actually
 become
 sustainable


and
 profitable
 as
 a
 business
 model.


Here's
 what
 I
 think
 is
 a
 good
 litmus


test.
 A
 traditional
 SAS
 startup
 with
 AI


features
 for
 tasks
 that
 can
 be


automated.
 Instead
 of
 building
 or


investing
 or
 using
 a
 Genai
 native


startup,
 you
 have
 to
 be
 looking
 for
 a


SAS
 startup
 with
 AI
 features
 for
 tasks


that
 can
 be
 automated.
 And
 this
 company


or
 startup
 has
 to
 be
 working
 off
 of


traditional
 SAS
 benchmarks,
 not
 bubbled


up
 AI
 metrics.
 The
 point
 where
 you
 know


that
 your
 product
 is
 valuable
 is
 when
 it


is
 valuable
 without
 AI
 and
 when
 it
 could


solve
 the
 real
 problem
 without
 AI.
 If


there
 is
 AI
 component
 in
 it
 and
 it
 makes


something
 better
 or
 faster,
 fantastic.


But
 AI
 should
 not
 be
 the
 defining
 factor


of
 the
 product.
 Now
 are
 there
 companies


that
 are
 still
 profitable
 by
 being


purely
 Gaii
 native
 and
 building
 their


positioning
 around
 Genaii?
 Yes,
 and
 some


of
 them
 work.
 But
 when
 it
 happens,
 it


usually
 follows
 the
 same
 scenario.
 The


vast
 majority
 of
 genai
 startups
 that


work
 are
 the
 apps
 that
 work
 with
 large


amount
 of
 textbased
 data
 and
 documents


in
 various
 industries
 be
 accounting,
 HR,


sales
 or
 legal.
 And
 what
 they
 do
 is
 for


example
 they
 stitch
 together
 contract


data
 with
 invoices,
 automating
 contract


customizations,
 connecting
 to
 CRM
 tools


and
 basically
 automating
 the
 back
 and


forth
 between
 various
 parties.
 Now
 is
 it


an
 example
 of
 a
 billion-dollar
 problem


or
 a
 billion-dollar
 business?
 No.
 But
 it


is
 a
 working
 business,
 a
 working
 AI


business.
 And
 you
 can
 get
 pretty


creative
 with
 how
 you
 sell
 it.
 It
 can
 be


a
 standalone
 product
 that
 you
 sell
 to


businesses.
 It
 can
 be
 a
 plug-in
 for


other
 products.
 It
 can
 also
 be
 sold
 as


an
 API.
 Now,
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 make


billions
 in
 revenue,
 but
 it
 is
 a


sustainable
 and
 viable
 business
 model.


The
 most
 difficult
 problems
 that
 I


personally
 haven't
 seen
 any
 AI
 startup


solve
 yet
 are
 those
 lengthy,
 effort


consuming,
 old
 school
 problems
 in
 very


boring
 industries.
 US
 enterprise
 world


is
 full
 of
 boring
 business
 problems
 that


need
 to
 be
 solved.
 It's
 also
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 I
 told
 you
 in
 my
 earlier
 videos


that
 if
 your
 job
 gets
 automated,
 the


world
 of
 enterprise
 and
 especially


legacy
 enterprise
 tech
 will
 always
 be


there
 for
 you.
 Under
 one
 of
 my
 most


recent
 videos,
 somebody
 commented
 that


legal
 tech
 is
 really
 easy
 to
 automate


because
 legal
 industry
 is
 textbased.
 I


beg
 to
 differ.
 I
 work
 in
 legal
 tech,
 a


very
 classic
 traditional
 industry.
 And


let
 me
 tell
 you
 that
 if
 you're
 able
 to


solve
 a
 problem
 that
 is
 prevalent
 in


industries
 like
 accounting,
 legal,
 or


pharma,
 you
 actually
 do
 have
 a
 chance
 at


building
 a
 unicorn.
 And
 that's
 a
 pretty


big
 if.
 I'm
 not
 talking
 about
 a
 GBT


rapper
 that
 sends
 contracts
 back
 and


forth.
 I'm
 talking
 about
 automating


truly
 difficult
 analytical
 or
 consulting


work
 done
 by,
 for
 example,
 a
 criminal


lawyer
 or
 corporate
 lawyer.
 pretty
 much


anyone
 who
 consults
 on
 cases
 or
 handles


rounds
 of
 negotiations.
 A
 friend
 of


mine,
 a
 very
 experienced
 lawyer,
 once


told
 me
 that
 if
 you
 can
 build
 a
 piece
 of


software
 that
 can
 negotiate,
 really


negotiate
 with
 a
 fellow
 lawyer
 or
 in


court,
 you'll
 be
 the
 next
 Elon
 Musk.


Because
 that
 is
 the
 kind
 of
 problem
 that


is
 incredibly
 difficult
 to
 crack
 and
 the


one
 that
 can
 bring
 you
 a
 ton
 of
 money


whether
 your
 business
 is
 geni
 native
 or


not.
 It's
 the
 kind
 of
 problem
 that
 will


outlive
 blowing
 up
 VC
 rounds
 or
 hype


cycles.
 There
 is
 nothing
 sexy
 about
 it,


but
 that
 is
 where
 the
 gold
 mine
 is.


Conclusion.


It's
 easy
 to
 get
 a
 user
 to
 try
 product


with
 big
 promises
 and
 even
 more
 so
 with


FOMO
 and
 scare
 tactics
 like
 AI
 will
 take


over
 your
 job.
 Don't
 be
 left
 behind
 by


progress.
 And
 it's
 even
 easy
 to
 get


people
 to
 pay.
 What's
 really
 difficult


is
 to
 deliver
 value.
 Value
 that
 a
 few


can
 replicate.
 And
 how
 do
 you
 know


you're
 delivering
 value?
 The
 same


metrics
 that
 have
 always
 mattered.


Retention
 and
 conversion
 rates.
 Those


two
 things
 will
 outlive
 blown
 up
 VC


rounds
 or
 hype
 waves.
 So
 before
 you


start
 thinking,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 this
 program


or
 this
 app
 is
 going
 to
 replace
 my
 job."


Ask
 yourself,
 would
 this
 app
 solve
 a


real
 problem
 without
 AI?
 If
 the
 answer


is
 no,
 you're
 fine.
 The
 hype
 won't
 last


forever,
 but
 boring,
 profitable


businesses
 will.
 And
 that's
 it
 for


today.
 As
 always,
 we
 hope
 this
 was


helpful.
 We'll
 see
 you
 next
 time.
 Bye.
