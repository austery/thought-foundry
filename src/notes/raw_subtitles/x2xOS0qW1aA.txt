who
 has
 already
 signed
 up
 to
 canvas.


[Music]


>> So,
 what
 I
 am
 staring
 at
 is
 a
 line
 of


people
 waiting
 to
 get
 inside
 Zoran


Mamani's


campaign
 rally
 here
 in
 Washington


Heights.
 It's
 now
 6:00
 p.m.
 on
 Monday


night,
 October
 13th.
 It's
 hard
 to


explain
 just
 how
 big
 this
 line
 is.
 It


literally
 spans
 three
 and
 a
 half
 blocks


and
 it
 is
 dense.
 And
 we
 are
 going
 to


talk
 to
 people
 in
 this
 line
 and
 inside


this
 rally
 about
 what
 it
 is
 Manny
 means


to
 them.


>> Let's
 go.


>> We're
 from
 the
 show
 called
 The
 Daily.


>> Oh,
 hello.


>> Hi.
 And
 we're
 just
 going
 to
 ask
 people


in
 a
 word
 what
 Mandonni
 means
 to
 you,


what
 he
 represents.


>> One
 word.


>> Yeah,
 why
 not?


>> Compassion.
 Honest
 person.


>> He's
 real.


>> He's
 brown
 and
 I'm
 brown.


>> That
 simple.


>> That
 simple.


>> Yeah.


>> Hope.


>> Hope.
 My
 first
 choice
 would
 be
 hope
 and


then
 the
 future.


>> I
 think
 he
 is
 a
 fresh
 and
 actual
 change


in
 the
 party.


>> I'm
 16
 years
 old
 and
 from
 what
 I've


heard.


>> Um,
 no
 I
 can't.
 But
 I've
 been


volunteering
 under
 Zoron
 and
 apparently


according
 to
 adults
 it's
 really
 rare
 to


be
 like
 happy
 or
 excited
 about
 a


politician.
 So
 you
 know
 this
 is
 kind
 of


a
 once
 in
 a
 lifetime
 thing.


>> I'm
 here
 cuz
 um
 actually
 my
 son
 turned


me
 to
 saw
 him.
 I
 didn't
 know
 anything


about
 him.
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 him
 one
 day.


I
 said,
 you
 know,
 I
 may
 just
 vote
 for


Cuomo
 because
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 Cuomo
 and


Adam.


>> Yeah.


>> He's
 like,
 you
 didn't
 hear
 about


Storeand.
 And
 I
 said,
 uh,
 no.
 He
 sent
 me


a
 couple
 of
 videos
 and
 I
 like
 what
 he


had
 to
 offer.


>> So
 much
 so
 that
 you're
 here
 at
 his


rally.


>> Yes.
 And
 I've
 been
 canvasing
 for
 him


actually
 the
 past
 three
 weeks.
 So,


>> we're
 also
 very
 excited
 about
 his


position
 about
 Palestine
 and
 what's


going
 on.
 I'm
 an
 anti-ionist
 Jewish
 girl


and
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 important
 that


people
 see
 that
 perspective,
 right?
 Like


>> finally
 some
 movement
 away
 from
 centrist


pandering
 to
 oligarchic
 fascists.
 Not
 to


put
 too
 fine
 a
 point
 on
 it,


>> a
 rather
 fine
 point.
 I
 just
 feel
 like


it's
 very
 necessary
 for
 us
 to
 have


places
 in
 this
 country
 that
 are
 very


openly
 progressive
 and
 are
 not
 bending


to
 the
 will
 of
 what
 the
 president
 wants


and
 what
 he
 represents.


>> As
 a
 workingclass
 person,
 this
 is
 very


exciting
 moment
 for
 us.
 Someone
 thinking


about
 us,
 someone
 commit
 to
 working
 for


us.


>> We're
 about
 to
 raise
 a
 family.
 We
 don't


want
 to
 be
 priced
 out.
 I've


>> You're
 pregnant.


>> Very
 much
 so.


>> How
 many
 months?


>> Eight.
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be


presumptuous,
 but
 free
 child
 care
 for


all.


>> We
 were
 just
 talking
 about
 that
 to
 you


as
 well.


>> It
 very
 much
 is.
 Yeah.


>> Doran
 to
 help
 us
 freeze
 the
 rent,


>> faster
 buses.


>> He's
 going
 to
 get
 free
 buses,


>> put
 cheaper
 groceries,


>> grocery
 cheaper,
 and
 child
 care


>> and
 help
 families.


>> All
 right.
 Wow.
 Thank
 you
 for
 your
 help.


>> People
 know
 this
 platform
 like
 they
 know


the
 back
 of
 their
 hands.


>> Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 come
 on
 down.
 Come


on
 in.


And
 now
 we
 go
 to
 security.


>> They'll
 check
 you
 in.


>> So,
 we're
 inside
 this
 auditorium
 now,


which
 has
 a
 capacity
 of
 about
 3,500


people,
 and
 it
 very
 much
 feels
 like
 it's


at
 capacity.


>> I
 need
 to
 for
 the
 next
 mayor
 of
 the
 city


of
 New
 York,
 Zoron.


>> After
 a
 very
 long
 wind
 up
 and
 a
 bunch
 of


introductory
 speeches,
 Mandani
 is
 now


finally
 taking
 the
 stage.


[Applause]


Billionaires
 like
 Bill
 Aman
 and
 Ronald


Lauder
 have
 poured


millions
 of
 dollars
 into
 this
 race


because
 they
 say
 that
 we
 pose
 an


existential
 threat.


And
 I
 am
 here
 to
 admit
 something.


They
 are
 right.


Fundamental
 change
 only
 comes
 from
 the


courage
 to
 turn
 your
 back
 on
 the
 old


formulas.


>> The
 courage
 to
 invent
 the
 future


>> together.
 That
 is
 exactly
 what
 we
 have


done.
 Because
 for
 all
 those
 who
 say


our
 time
 is
 coming,


>> my
 friends,


our
 time
 is
 now.


[Music]


Okay,
 so
 the
 rally
 is
 now
 over.
 The


crowd
 is
 spilling
 out
 onto
 the
 streets


of
 Washington
 Heights
 and
 the
 next
 stop


for
 us
 is
 Mamani's
 campaign
 headquarters


in
 Manhattan
 where
 we
 are
 going
 to
 sit


down
 with
 him
 for
 an
 interview.
 From
 the


New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Michael
 Barbaro.


This
 is
 the
 daily.
 Today,
 Zoron
 Mandani


on
 the
 movement
 he's
 created
 in
 New
 York


City,
 his
 critique
 of
 the
 Democratic


Party,


his
 courtship
 of
 those
 he
 has
 alienated


with
 his
 campaign
 so
 far,
 and
 his
 plans


to
 stand
 up
 to
 Donald
 Trump.
 It's


Thursday,
 October
 16th.


[Music]


Hello.


>> Hey,
 we're
 here
 to
 go
 to
 the
 Mandani


campaign
 headquarters.
 How's
 this
 going?


Can
 they
 come?


>> Yeah.


>> Oh,
 they'll
 come
 pick
 us
 up.
 Okay,
 I'll


text
 them.
 You're
 welcome.


>> Oh,
 there's
 Assemblyman.
 Nani.


>> Hello.
 How
 are
 you?


>> Hello.
 How's
 it
 going?
 Pleasure
 to
 meet


you.
 It's
 such
 a
 pleasure.


>> Hi,


>> Aa.
 Nice
 to
 meet
 you.


Do


>> you
 mind
 helping
 me?


The


>> third
 floor,
 which
 we
 sometimes
 stop
 at,


has
 these
 Halloween
 decorations
 that


always
 take
 you
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 back.


>> Is
 this
 Is
 this
 your
 office?


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.


>> Oh,
 wow.


>> To
 call
 it
 modest


>> would
 be
 an
 injustice
 to
 the
 word


modest.


>> Modest
 is


>> Yeah,
 you
 can
 sit
 in
 that
 chair.


>> The
 recliner.


Okay,
 we're
 going.
 Um,


Assemblyman,


do
 people
 call
 you
 Assemblyman?


>> Some
 people
 do.
 You
 can
 you
 can
 call
 me


Zoran.


>> That's
 a
 little
 familiar.
 Um,


Assemblyman
 Mandani,
 thank
 you
 for


making
 time
 for
 us
 and
 thank
 you
 for


inviting
 us
 to
 your
 rally
 last
 night.


>> You're
 very
 welcome.
 It's
 a
 pleasure
 to


be
 here.
 So,
 you
 sit,
 according
 to
 the


polls,
 including
 our
 own
 at
 the
 times,


on
 the
 cusp
 of
 a
 historic
 political


victory,
 because
 at
 the
 age
 of
 well,


you're
 now
 33,
 but
 you'll
 be
 34
 just
 a


couple
 days
 after
 this
 runs.


You
 would
 be
 the
 youngest
 mayor
 in
 a


century.
 You'd
 be
 New
 York
 City's
 first


Muslim
 mayor.
 You'd
 be
 its
 first


Democratic
 Socialist
 mayor.


>> Well,
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 actually
 be
 the
 first


Democratic
 socialist
 mayor.


>> Who
 would
 it
 be?
 David
 Dinkens
 was
 also


a
 member
 of
 the
 Democratic
 Socialist.
 A


co-member
 of
 the
 Democratic
 Party
 on
 the


right.
 Is
 that
 it?


>> Well,
 he
 was
 a
 member
 of
 DSA,
 identified


also
 as
 a
 Democratic
 Socialist.


>> Interesting.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 Thank
 you


for
 the
 correction.
 Unaware.


>> You'd
 be
 the
 second
 Democratic
 Socialist


mayor
 after
 David
 Dinkens.
 And
 I'd
 like


for
 this
 conversation
 to
 trace
 the
 arc


of
 how
 you
 got
 to
 this
 moment,
 the


forces,
 the
 ideas
 that
 made
 you
 the


candidate
 that
 first
 got
 into
 this
 race,


the
 style
 of
 the
 campaign
 that


transformed
 you
 from
 being,
 I
 think
 it's


safe
 to
 say,
 virtually
 unknown
 into
 the


winner
 of
 the
 primary
 for
 the
 Democratic


nomination,
 and
 the
 way
 since
 that
 you


have
 tried
 to
 broaden
 your
 appeal,


answer
 your
 skeptics
 in
 this
 general


election,
 and
 finally,
 of
 course,
 what


it
 will
 look
 like
 if
 you
 do
 become


mayor.
 And
 somehow
 we're
 going
 to
 do


that
 in
 an
 hour.
 You
 grew
 up
 the
 son
 of


a
 well-known
 filmmaker.
 Your
 mother


directed
 Denzel
 Washington.
 Even


>> Mississippi
 Masala.


>> Mississippi
 Masala.
 Your
 father
 was
 a


college
 professor
 who
 studied
 among


other
 things
 apartheid
 and
 genocide.


>> As
 a
 young
 man,
 you
 become
 a
 college


activist.
 You're
 focused
 on


progressive
 politics.
 And
 when
 you


graduate
 from
 college
 and
 start
 your


career
 in
 the
 progressive
 world,
 you


start
 to
 identify
 not
 as
 a
 Democrat,
 but


as
 a
 member
 of
 the
 Democratic
 Socialists


of
 America.
 And
 given
 your
 bio,
 being
 a


Democrat
 feels
 like
 it
 would
 have
 been
 a


pretty
 natural
 home.
 So
 just
 let
 me


start
 by
 asking
 about
 what
 went
 into


that
 decision,
 what
 you
 were
 embracing


and
 what
 you
 were
 rejecting
 in
 that


identification.
 So
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 describe


those
 two
 identities
 as
 mutually


exclusive.
 I
 think
 that
 one
 can
 live


within
 the
 other.
 Meaning
 that
 I
 am
 both


a
 democratic
 socialist
 and
 I'm
 also
 a


democrat.
 One
 is
 a
 description
 of
 my


political
 ideology.
 The
 other
 is
 a


description
 of
 the
 party
 that
 I
 belong


to.


>> DSA
 being
 the
 ideology,


>> democratic
 socialism
 being
 the
 ideology,


DSA
 being
 an
 organization,
 the


Democratic
 Party
 being
 the
 party.
 And
 it


was
 Bernie
 Sanders's
 run
 in
 2016
 that


gave
 me
 the
 language
 of
 democratic


socialism
 to
 describe
 my
 own
 politics.


It
 took
 what
 I
 had
 thought
 were


disperate
 ideas
 and
 cohered
 them
 and


gave
 me
 an
 understanding
 of
 what
 that


politics
 was
 and
 also
 what
 a
 larger


movement
 looked
 like
 of
 people
 who
 also


were
 animated
 by
 that
 same
 focus
 on


dignity
 on
 the
 unacceptable
 nature
 of


income
 inequality
 across
 this
 country.


And
 to
 me,
 what
 democratic
 socialism


means
 is
 a
 belief
 that
 it
 is


government's
 job
 to
 ensure
 that
 every


person
 is
 living
 a
 life
 of
 dignity.


>> And
 dignity
 is
 not
 the
 things
 that
 you'd


like.
 It's
 not
 the
 things
 that
 you'd


want.
 It's
 the
 things
 that
 you
 need.
 And


there's
 a
 general
 common
 sense
 around


many
 of
 those
 things.
 You
 know,
 in
 New


York
 City,
 in
 this
 country,
 we'd
 say


that
 every
 child
 deserves
 public


education
 that's
 free
 point
 of
 service


of
 K
 through
 12.
 But
 we
 also
 think
 that


it's
 okay
 to
 be
 priced
 out
 of
 the


education
 you
 need
 prior
 to
 that.
 Child


care.


>> And
 for
 some
 reason,
 there's
 a
 point
 at


which
 you
 should
 deserve
 education.
 Then


there's
 a
 point
 before
 that
 at
 which
 it


depends
 on
 your
 family's
 ability
 to
 pay.


>> Right.
 And
 it's
 somewhat
 arbitrary.


>> Yes.
 And
 the
 ability
 to
 pay
 is
 not
 a


nominal
 amount.
 We're
 talking
 about
 an


average
 generally
 of
 $22,500


a
 year
 for
 a
 3-year-old
 or
 a


four-year-old
 or
 a
 2-year-old.
 And
 so
 to


me,
 what
 democratic
 socialism
 is
 the
 the


fulfillment
 of
 the
 ideal
 that
 underpins


things
 that
 already
 exist
 within
 our


society
 but
 are
 currently
 being
 applied


in
 either
 a
 partial
 manner
 or
 not
 at


all.
 So
 democratic
 socialism
 gives
 you
 a


vocabulary
 to
 identify
 those
 injustices,


those
 inequities
 and
 say


they
 don't
 need
 to
 be.
 And
 it
 teaches
 me


that
 the
 way
 I
 feel
 about
 housing
 and


the
 way
 I
 feel
 about
 public
 transit
 and


the
 way
 I
 feel
 about
 child
 care,
 these


are
 not
 different
 opinions
 necessarily.


They
 are
 in
 fact
 rooted
 in
 the
 same


understanding
 of
 the
 world
 we
 should
 be


living
 in.
 Democrats
 talk
 about
 many
 of


the
 things
 that
 you
 just
 identified
 have


for
 quite
 some
 time,
 right?
 Childare,


healthcare,
 affordability.


And
 I
 think
 it's
 fair
 to
 say


that,
 and
 this
 I
 think
 was
 on
 display
 at


your
 rally
 last
 night,
 that
 you
 have


some
 real
 objections
 to
 the
 way


traditional
 Democrats
 have
 operated.
 And


I
 want
 to
 get
 to
 the
 heart
 of
 that
 where


you
 think
 the
 distinction
 lies
 between


the
 problems
 you're
 identifying
 and
 want


to
 solve
 the
 vision
 for
 solving
 it
 and


what
 the
 existing
 Democratic
 parties


view
 of
 those
 things
 are
 because
 you


don't
 mince
 words
 about
 old
 ways,
 old


formulas


and
 a
 kind
 of
 sclerotic
 democratic
 party


that
 you
 see
 your
 movement
 as
 not
 just


changing
 but
 maybe
 fully
 replacing.


You
 know,
 in
 this
 race
 right
 now,
 it's


easy
 to
 view


one
 of
 my
 opponents,
 Andrew
 Cuomo,


through
 the


>> former
 governor,
 y


>> caricature
 that
 he
 is
 creating
 of


himself.


But
 prior
 to
 this
 moment,
 he
 was


considered
 by
 many
 to
 be
 a
 leader
 in
 the


Democratic
 party,


>> one
 of
 the
 most
 prominent
 Democrats
 to


emerge
 from
 this
 state.
 at
 a
 point


someone
 that
 people
 were
 speaking
 about


as


a
 politician
 who
 should
 run
 for


president
 of
 this
 country.


>> I
 remember


>> and
 he
 is
 an
 example
 of
 so
 much
 of
 what


has
 disappointed
 so
 many
 about
 our
 party


because


for
 for
 all
 that
 he
 is
 today,
 there
 have


been
 examples
 of
 this
 in
 years
 past.
 And


these
 these
 were
 the
 very
 things
 that
 we


would
 overlook
 or
 we
 would
 simply
 see
 as


parts
 of
 what
 politics
 had
 to
 be.


>> Yeah.
 Get
 specific
 about
 it
 if
 you
 don't


mind


>> because
 I
 think
 there
 are
 plent
 there


are
 plenty
 of
 New
 Yorkers
 who
 see
 an


Andrew
 Cuomo
 putting
 aside
 which
 for


many
 is
 impossible
 the
 allegations
 of


sexual
 misconduct.


>> A
 governor
 who
 used
 his
 platform
 to


remake
 Lagori
 airport
 to
 build
 Moahan


Station.
 we
 just
 went
 through
 it
 to
 pass


gay
 marriage
 who
 used
 the
 Democratic


party
 and
 its
 values
 to
 create
 pretty


substantial
 change.


And
 he's
 the
 same
 governor
 who
 ensured


that
 there
 would
 be
 Republican
 power
 in


Albany
 such
 that
 the
 only
 progress
 that


would
 be
 made
 was
 that
 which
 he
 was


willing
 to
 accept.
 Many
 of
 the
 same


achievements
 that
 are
 accredited
 to
 him


are
 the
 ones
 that
 he
 was
 initially
 an


obstacle
 towards
 before
 becoming
 seen
 as


the
 architect
 of.
 Thinking
 about
 this
 as


the
 same
 person
 who
 cut
 funding
 for
 a


program
 called
 Advantage
 that
 was


providing
 millions
 of
 dollars
 in


connecting
 homeless
 New
 Yorkers
 with


apartments
 that
 they
 could
 live
 in.
 M


>> and
 I
 actually
 met
 a
 woman
 right
 here
 in


New
 York
 City
 who
 had
 just
 been
 approved


to
 that
 program
 right
 before
 the
 funding


was
 cut.
 And
 the
 cutting
 of
 that
 funding


was
 one
 that
 then
 pushed
 her
 out
 of
 the


apartment
 that
 she
 was
 able
 to
 rent.


>> This
 is
 the
 same
 governor
 who
 gave
 Elon


Musk
 $959
 million
 in
 tax
 credits


>> in
 New
 York.


>> In
 New
 York.
 I
 say
 these
 things
 because


sometimes
 it's
 tempting
 to
 think
 that


all
 that
 is
 wrong
 in
 this
 moment
 is
 from


Donald
 Trump.
 But
 it's
 important
 that


the
 very
 same
 people
 that
 we
 have


villainized
 and
 thought
 of
 solely


through
 the
 prism
 of
 Trump
 existed
 prior


to
 him
 and
 in
 fact
 were
 some
 of
 the
 very


people
 that
 were
 uplifted
 by
 these
 kinds


of
 leaders
 within
 the
 Democratic
 party.


If
 you
 want
 to
 understand
 why
 so
 many


have
 come
 to
 associate
 politics
 with
 a


extended
 play
 of
 diminishing
 faith
 and


trust.
 Then
 we
 also
 have
 to
 understand


who
 the
 politicians
 have
 been
 that
 have


been
 leading
 these
 very
 parties
 and
 that


many
 of
 these
 issues
 are
 not
 exclusive


to
 the
 Republican
 party.
 They
 are
 in


fact
 endemic
 within
 our
 own
 party.
 And


if
 we
 want
 to
 truly
 move
 beyond
 Donald


Trump,
 we
 also
 have
 to
 understand
 the


systems
 that
 allowed
 for
 the
 flourishing


of
 someone
 like
 Donald
 Trump
 and
 that


many
 of
 those
 systems
 and
 styles
 of


politics
 are
 also
 within
 our
 own
 party


and
 Andrew
 Cuomo
 being
 an
 example
 of
 the


fusion
 of
 these
 things.
 So
 just
 to


distill
 this
 critique,
 Democrats
 like


Cuomo
 make
 big
 progressive
 promises.


When
 the
 rubber
 meets
 the
 road
 in
 your


mind,
 they
 will
 cave
 to
 the
 other
 side,


to
 the
 elites,
 to
 the
 donor
 class.
 They


ultimately
 disappoint
 on
 questions
 like


affordability


and
 you're
 saying
 you
 will
 not
 you
 will


not
 do
 that.
 You
 will
 not
 disappoint.


>> Yes,


>> that's
 the
 idea.


>> Yes.


Why
 do
 you
 think
 that
 they
 make


compromises
 that
 you,


not
 yet
 mayor,
 not
 governor,
 um,
 and
 not


having
 to
 work
 with
 the
 other
 side
 are


so
 certain
 you
 will
 never
 make?


>> I've
 heard
 about
 these
 pauses.


>> It's
 interesting.
 Well,
 you
 think


>> it's
 interesting
 to
 hear
 you
 say
 the


word
 the
 other
 side.
 Part
 of
 my
 point
 is


that
 Andrew
 Cuomo
 created
 the
 other
 side


in
 Albany.
 He
 took
 what
 would
 have


otherwise
 been
 a
 democratic
 trifecta
 of


Democratic
 control
 of
 the
 governor's


office,
 the
 Assembly,
 and
 the
 state


senate
 and
 ensured
 that
 there
 was
 a


Republican
 minority
 in
 the
 Senate
 that


was
 in
 power.
 We're
 talking
 a
 little
 bit


inside
 baseball,
 but
 in
 New
 York,
 Andrew


Cuomo
 almost


>> needed,
 wanted,
 benefited
 from


>> a
 diffusion
 of
 power
 that
 kept
 the


Democratic
 and
 frankly
 the
 progressives


in
 New
 York
 in
 check.


>> Exactly.
 And
 I
 I
 share
 this
 example.


>> It's
 almost
 like
 you
 spent
 some
 time
 in


Alb


>> as
 as
 inside
 baseball
 as
 it
 is,


>> but
 I
 think
 that's
 clearly
 because
 he


feared
 an
 unchecked
 left
 or
 a
 left
 that


would
 actually
 be
 able
 to
 deliver.
 And


God
 forbid
 an
 unchecked
 left
 that
 was


able
 to
 fulfill
 the
 aspirations
 of


working
 people.
 And
 I
 say
 this
 because


governing
 will
 necessitate
 compromise.


There's
 no
 question
 about
 that.
 Some
 of


the
 compromises
 that
 have
 been
 made,


however,
 are
 not
 the
 ones
 that
 are


actually
 innate
 to
 these
 positions
 and


to
 this
 politics.
 Some
 of
 them
 have


actually
 been
 created
 as
 a
 means
 by


which
 to
 ensure
 that
 we
 could
 never


fulfill
 the
 ideals
 that
 have
 brought
 so


many
 to
 politics.
 And
 the
 reason
 I
 am


confident
 in
 my
 ability
 to
 deliver
 on


what
 we
 have
 campaigned
 on
 is
 because
 of


the
 fact
 one
 that
 we
 have
 campaigned
 on


a
 very
 specific
 set
 of
 commitments.
 I


would
 argue
 that
 far
 more
 than
 many


other
 campaigns
 New
 Yorkers
 know
 exactly


what
 it
 is
 that
 I'm
 running
 on.
 I'll


have
 people
 stop
 me
 in
 the
 street
 and


just
 shout
 fast
 and
 free
 buses
 or


universal
 childare
 or
 freeze
 the
 rent.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that
 means
 that
 we're
 building


a
 movement
 not
 around
 an
 individual
 but


rather
 around
 these
 policy
 commitments.


And
 that
 is
 what
 we
 will
 be
 held
 to


account
 for.
 And
 that
 is
 something
 that


I
 want
 because
 in
 order
 to
 bring
 people


back
 to
 politics,
 in
 order
 to
 bring


people's
 faith
 back
 to
 the
 idea
 that


government
 could
 actually
 make
 their


lives
 easier,
 we
 have
 to
 be
 honest
 about


what
 it
 is
 we're
 fighting
 for,
 who
 we're


fighting
 for,
 and
 then
 to
 deliver
 on


those
 very
 things.
 I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 for


just
 a
 moment
 to
 a
 timeline
 when
 you're


kind
 of
 working
 your
 way
 from


progressive
 causes
 into
 politics.


Clearly,
 you've
 been
 you're
 inspired
 at


this
 phase
 by
 Senator
 Bernie
 Sanders,


this
 movement,
 this
 campaign
 he's


created.


You
 run
 for
 state
 assembly
 in
 2020,
 a


really
 big
 year
 in
 American


civil
 discourse,
 politics,
 and
 I
 wonder


if
 you'd
 agree
 with
 this.
 It
 it
 feels
 to


me
 looking
 back
 at
 that
 period


that
 you're
 very
 much
 straddling
 the


line
 still
 between
 an
 activist
 political


candidate.
 People
 who
 may
 someday
 run


for
 mayor
 of
 New
 York
 City,
 for


instance,
 tend
 not
 to
 go
 on
 social
 media


and
 write
 things.
 And
 you
 know
 this


tweet
 and
 I
 know
 it
 gets
 brought
 up.
 I


think
 it's
 fair
 game
 when
 you
 wrote
 in


2020,
 "We
 don't
 need
 an
 investigation
 to


know
 that
 the
 NYPD
 is
 racist,
 anti-quer,


a
 major
 threat
 to
 public
 safety.


You
 call
 for
 defunding
 the
 NYPD.


People
 who
 think
 they
 may
 run
 for
 mayor


tend
 not
 to
 describe
 themselves
 ever
 as


anti-Zionists.
 Those
 things
 in
 the
 past


would
 be
 seen
 potentially
 as


disqualifying.


That
 clearly
 didn't
 happen
 in
 this
 case


with
 you.
 But
 I
 am
 curious
 what
 prompted


you
 to
 express
 those
 views,
 especially


about
 the
 police
 at
 that
 time.
 You
 know,


I
 moved
 to
 New
 York
 City
 when
 I
 was
 7


years
 old.
 This
 is
 where
 I
 grew
 up.
 And


one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 would
 think


about
 often
 was
 the
 necessity
 of
 safety


and
 justice.
 And
 growing
 up
 meant


learning
 about
 the
 moments
 in
 which
 the


chasm
 between
 those
 things


felt
 as
 if
 it
 was
 only
 continuing
 to


expand.
 M


>> learning
 about
 the
 Central
 Park
 5,


growing
 up
 in
 the
 city
 and
 reading
 about


>> the
 wrongly
 convicted


>> alleged


>> exonerated
 five.


>> Yep.


>> Growing
 up
 and
 reading
 about
 Shawn
 Bell,


Eric
 Garner.


>> Yeah.
 These
 are
 victims
 of


>> police
 brutality.


>> Police
 brutality
 in
 the
 city.


>> Reading
 about
 Michael
 Brown.


And
 then
 in
 2020
 in
 the
 year
 that
 the


tweet
 is
 written,
 the
 murder
 of
 George


Floyd.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 feeling
 like
 this
 chasm
 was
 at
 the


largest
 I'd
 seen
 it
 in
 my
 own
 life
 and


struggling
 with
 how
 far
 apart
 it
 felt.


and
 in
 the
 time
 since
 then
 becoming
 an


assembly
 member
 representing
 about


130,000
 people
 in
 northwest
 Queens


historia
 and
 Long
 Island
 City


and
 learning
 that
 to
 deliver
 that


justice
 doesn't
 mean
 to
 do
 so
 in


isolation.
 It
 means
 to
 still
 fulfill


these
 twin
 necessities
 of
 safety
 and


justice.
 And
 doing
 so
 means
 working
 with


police
 officers
 who
 put
 their
 lives
 on


the
 line
 every
 single
 day,
 representing


Muslim
 New
 Yorkers
 in
 the
 district
 that


I
 represent
 who
 were
 illegally
 surveiled


on
 the
 basis
 of
 their
 faith,
 going
 so


far
 as
 even
 to
 be
 watched
 when
 they


played
 soccer.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 the
 black
 and
 brown
 New
 Yorkers


who've
 been
 victims
 of
 police
 brutality.


It
 means
 representing
 all
 of
 the
 8
 and
 a


half
 million
 people
 of
 this
 city
 and


understanding
 the
 necessities
 of
 doing


so
 while
 delivering
 safety
 and
 justice


and
 understanding
 that
 no
 one
 thing
 can


be
 or
 should
 be
 pursued
 without
 the


other.
 Let
 me
 let
 me
 fast
 forward
 a


little
 bit
 to
 June,
 the
 primary,
 where


you
 blow
 everyone
 away,
 all
 your


opponents.
 And
 it
 seems
 like
 even
 on
 the


night
 of
 that
 victory,
 you
 start
 to


confront
 those
 who
 are
 skeptical
 of
 you


and
 who
 you
 want
 to
 win
 over.
 And
 since


we
 were
 just
 talking
 about
 police,
 let's


talk
 about
 what
 you
 have
 said
 since
 the


primary
 victory.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 actually


at
 the
 times
 where
 my
 colleagues
 asked


you
 about
 how
 you're
 going
 to
 be


thinking
 about
 the
 police
 and
 and
 I
 was


struck
 that
 you
 said
 you
 were
 prepared


to
 apologize
 to
 the
 NYPD
 for
 some
 of
 the


things
 you
 had
 said
 defund
 the


allegation
 that


the
 department
 is
 racist.


Given
 what
 you
 just
 said
 about
 the


experiences
 you
 recollect,
 why
 issue


that
 apology
 and
 what
 would
 the
 apology


even
 be?
 The
 issuing
 of
 it
 is
 to
 reckon


with
 the
 fact
 that
 it's
 language
 that


I'm
 applying
 to
 officers


>> when
 in
 fact
 what
 I'm
 speaking
 about
 are


specific
 practices.
 And
 when
 I've
 met


officers,
 not
 only
 over
 the
 course
 of


being
 an
 assembly
 person,
 but
 also


running
 for
 mayor,
 understanding
 that


behind
 every
 caricature,
 behind
 every


headline
 is
 a
 New
 Yorker
 trying
 to
 do


their
 best.


and
 those
 meetings,
 those
 conversations,


those
 are
 some
 of
 the
 ones
 I've


appreciated
 the
 most
 where
 I've
 shared


an
 apology
 for
 the
 language
 that
 I've


used
 and
 a
 desire
 to
 continue
 to
 fulfill


those
 same
 ideals
 of
 safety
 and
 of


justice
 and
 to
 do
 so
 together.
 Are
 you


apologizing
 for
 the
 language
 or
 for
 the


thinking
 behind
 it?
 And
 I
 don't
 I'm
 not


trying
 to
 be
 academic
 about
 this,
 but
 do


you
 still
 think
 that
 the
 NYPD
 as
 an


institution
 is
 racist?


>> No.
 And
 and
 I'm
 what
 I'm
 apologizing
 is


for
 the
 language
 that
 I've
 used
 and
 also


doing
 so
 as
 someone
 who
 is
 cleareyed


about
 the
 necessity


of
 still
 fulfilling
 those
 two
 things.


>> Mhm.
 Let
 me
 turn
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 your


outreach
 which
 has
 been
 really
 striking.


I
 mean,
 let's
 turn
 to
 developers
 and
 to


frankly
 the
 super
 rich
 in
 New
 York
 and


business
 leaders.
 You've
 been
 openly


skeptical
 of
 the
 role
 of
 developers.
 For


example,
 you
 have
 said
 you
 don't
 think


billionaires
 should
 exist.
 Last
 night
 at


your
 rally,
 you
 said
 that
 your
 movement


is
 an
 existential
 threat
 to
 billionaires


>> who
 think
 that
 they
 can
 buy
 an
 election.


>> Full
 quote.


>> You
 got
 to
 you
 got
 to


>> you
 got
 to
 fill
 the
 you
 got
 to
 You're


right.
 You
 can't
 do
 the


>> accurately.
 That's
 what
 I
 wrote
 down.


Maybe
 I
 missed
 the
 full
 sense.
 Um,


and
 you
 would
 like
 to
 increase
 taxes
 on


those
 making
 over
 a
 million
 dollars
 a


year
 to
 pay
 for
 things
 like
 the
 the


three
 big
 promises


>> by
 2%.
 And
 yet
 you're
 meeting
 with
 many


of
 these
 people
 at
 their
 offices,
 at


their
 homes
 in
 some
 cases.
 What
 have
 you


said
 to
 those
 leaders
 in
 your
 meetings


with
 them?
 And
 what
 have
 they
 said
 to


you?


I've
 said
 many
 of
 the
 same
 things
 that


I'm
 saying
 at
 these
 rallies,
 out
 on
 the


street,
 in
 these
 conversations,
 which
 is


that
 I
 continue
 to
 believe
 that


two
 of
 the
 most
 straightforward
 and


productive
 ways
 to
 raise
 revenue
 to
 fund


a
 significant
 part
 of
 our
 affordability


agenda
 and
 the
 need
 to
 trump
 the
 city


are
 by,
 as
 you
 said,


>> Trump
 proof,
 we'll
 get
 back
 to
 that.


>> Yes.
 are
 by
 increasing
 personal
 income


taxes
 on
 the
 top
 1%
 of
 New
 Yorkers.
 New


Yorkers
 make
 a
 million
 dollars
 a
 year
 or


more
 by
 2%.
 And
 by
 increasing
 the


state's
 top
 corporate
 tax
 rate
 from


7.25%
 to
 match
 that
 of
 New
 Jersey,


11.5%.


The
 socialist
 utopia


>> of
 New
 Jersey.


>> Socialist
 utopia
 of
 New
 Jersey.


>> Yes.
 Um,


>> you
 were
 joking
 about
 that,
 just
 to
 be


clear.


And
 what
 I've
 appreciated
 about
 these


conversations
 is
 that
 everyone
 knows


exactly
 where
 I
 stand
 on
 these
 fiscal


policies.


>> And
 I'm
 looking
 to
 have
 a
 conversation


both
 about
 why
 I
 believe
 in
 these
 fiscal


policies,
 but
 also
 that
 a
 disagreement


on
 those
 policies
 should
 not
 preclude
 us


from
 looking
 for
 agreements
 elsewhere.
 I


mean,
 it
 feels
 like
 what
 you're
 saying


to
 these
 business
 leaders
 is,
 look,
 I'm


going
 to
 be
 making
 changes
 to
 the


system,
 but
 I'm
 not
 turning
 New
 York


City,
 this
 center
 of
 American


capitalism,
 into
 a
 socialist
 utopia.
 If


I
 if
 I'm
 kind
 of
 hearing
 you
 correctly,


>> I'm
 I'm
 and
 I'm


>> Let
 me
 just
 get
 specific
 about
 about


about
 a
 particular
 policy
 and
 I
 want
 to


understand
 your
 fidelity
 to
 it.


>> The
 idea
 of
 what
 is
 being
 called
 a


millionaire's
 tax,
 2%
 tax
 on
 income
 over


a
 million
 dollars,
 which
 is
 which
 feels


very
 central
 to
 your
 agenda,
 felt
 very


integral
 to
 the
 campaign
 in
 the
 primary.


Since
 the
 primary,
 my
 sense,
 please


correct
 me
 if
 I'm
 wrong,
 is
 that
 you've


expressed
 an
 openness,
 and
 I
 don't
 know


if
 this
 flowed
 from
 your
 conversations


with
 business
 leaders
 to
 fund
 your


agenda


outside
 of
 that
 kind
 of
 attacks.
 And
 and


you
 know
 this,
 and
 our
 listeners
 may
 not


as
 well,
 New
 York
 and
 New
 York
 City
 are


funky.
 The
 governor
 and
 the
 state


legislature
 control
 all
 taxes,
 but


property
 tax.
 And
 the
 two
 taxes
 you
 just


mentioned
 therefore
 require
 the


participation
 of
 the
 governor
 who
 says


she
 does
 not
 want
 to
 participate
 in


these
 so
 far
 and
 the
 state
 legislature.


So
 you
 seem
 to
 now
 be
 saying
 it
 doesn't


necessarily
 matter
 where
 the
 money
 comes


from.


But
 for
 democratic
 socialists
 and
 for


this
 agenda
 that
 you
 are
 an
 avatar
 of,


isn't
 taxing
 the
 rich
 more


as
 a
 principle
 important?
 Isn't
 the


method
 here
 important
 or
 are
 you
 being


more
 pragmatic
 about
 it?


>> If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 chronology
 of
 the


campaign,


the
 first
 thing
 we
 speak
 about
 is
 what


we
 are
 looking
 to
 fund.


>> October
 23rd
 when
 we
 launched
 the


campaign,
 we
 talk
 about
 freezing
 the


rent
 for
 rent
 stabilized
 tenants,
 making


buses
 fast
 and
 free,
 delivering


universal
 childare.
 The
 most
 important


thing
 is
 always
 the
 policies
 themselves.


And
 I
 continue
 to
 believe
 as
 a
 principle


that
 it's
 important
 to
 have
 a
 fair


system
 of
 taxation.
 And
 I
 do
 not
 think


the
 one
 that
 we
 have
 is
 an
 example
 of


that.
 And
 to
 me,
 it
 is
 always
 and
 has


always
 been
 the
 case
 that
 far
 more


important
 than
 the
 means
 by
 which
 you


fund
 something
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 are


in
 fact
 funding
 it.
 And
 so
 I
 still
 think


that
 these
 two
 tax
 proposals
 are
 the


most
 straightforward
 and
 productive
 ways


to
 do
 so.
 There
 are
 other
 revenue


proposals
 that
 also
 exist
 that
 have
 been


put
 forward.
 There's
 also
 the
 fact
 that


I
 have
 sat
 in
 Albany
 year
 after
 year


>> and
 watched


>> and
 watched
 as
 we've
 been
 told
 the


receipts
 we
 estimated
 they're
 actually


going
 to
 be
 bigger
 this
 year
 than
 we


thought.
 And
 if
 there
 is
 a
 proposal
 that


the
 $4
 billion
 we
 would
 raise
 from
 one


of
 these
 taxes
 from
 the
 personal
 income


tax
 increase
 can
 be
 found
 elsewhere,
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 fight
 to
 bring
 it
 back
 to


the
 original
 means
 that
 I
 suggested.
 I'm


going
 to
 fight
 to
 ensure
 that
 that
 $4


billion
 is
 then
 used
 to
 fund
 a


significant
 portion
 of
 universal


childare.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 always
 has
 to


be
 what
 drives
 us,
 that
 we
 are
 funding


the
 affordability
 agenda,
 not
 the


question
 of
 how.
 And
 I
 do
 believe
 these


are
 the
 two
 most
 straightforward
 ways
 to


do
 so.


>> Right.
 So
 the
 method
 does
 matter,
 but
 it


doesn't
 have
 to
 be


this
 method
 that
 gets
 there.
 I
 mean,
 it


it
 does
 strike
 me
 that
 you're
 already


starting
 to
 confront
 some
 of
 the


challenges
 that


when
 you
 talk
 about
 Cuomo,
 you
 found


distasteful,
 which
 is,
 you
 know,
 you're


dealing
 with
 a
 Democratic
 governor
 who


isn't
 on
 the
 same
 page
 with
 you.
 And


that's
 that's
 an
 immediate
 kind
 of
 like


>> old
 versus
 DSA
 mom
 donnie.


>> I
 would
 contrast
 governor
 with
 with


Governor
 Cuomo
 in
 that
 Cuomo


almost
 made
 it
 his
 mission
 to
 go
 to
 war


with
 New
 York
 City.


>> Mhm.


>> He
 would
 cut
 so
 much
 of
 what
 he
 could


find
 in
 what
 the
 state
 was
 funding


across
 these
 five
 burrows.
 And
 when
 Bill


Delasio
 ran
 on
 a
 promise
 of
 universal


prek
 and
 the
 necessity
 of
 working
 with


Albany
 to
 find
 the
 funding
 for
 that


program,
 Governor
 Cuomo
 was
 one
 of the


chief
 obstacles
 to
 it.


>> Right.


>> And
 what
 I
 found
 is
 that
 though
 Governor


Hokll
 and
 I
 have
 a
 disagreement
 as
 to


the
 necessity
 of
 taxing
 the
 wealthiest


New
 Yorkers,
 the
 most
 profitable


corporations,
 we
 have
 a
 clear
 agreement


on
 the
 importance
 of
 universal
 childare.


And
 to
 me
 that
 is
 the
 kind
 of
 agreement


that
 was
 missing
 under
 the
 previous


leader
 of
 the
 state
 because
 so
 often
 he


was
 the
 obstacle
 to
 any
 affirmative


vision
 of
 what
 government
 could
 be
 doing


for
 working
 people.
 Then
 there's
 the


Jewish
 community
 as
 we
 as
 we
 kind
 of


tick
 through
 the
 folks
 that
 you
 have


been
 meeting
 with
 and
 you
 end
 up
 in


rooms
 where
 people
 have
 been
 challenging


you
 directly
 sometimes
 emotionally
 is
 my


sense.
 I'm
 thinking
 about
 Dr.
 Albert


Borilla,
 CEO
 of
 Fizer,
 our
 colleagues,


reported
 on
 your
 conversation
 with
 him.


He's
 the
 son
 of
 Holocaust
 survivors,
 and


he
 pleads
 with
 you
 to
 stop
 calling


what's
 been
 happening
 in
 Gaza
 up
 until


now
 there's
 now
 a
 ceasefire
 a
 genocide,


which
 is
 what
 you
 call
 it,
 and
 he
 pushed


for
 you
 to
 condemn
 this
 phrase


globalizing
 and
 tifata
 because
 in
 his


mind,
 it
 raises
 a
 spectre
 of
 violence


against
 Jews.
 My
 sense
 is
 that
 in
 these


conversations
 you've
 you've
 given
 some


ground
 on
 things
 like
 Koblies
 and
 Tifat


not
 on
 genocide


and
 I
 wonder
 what
 you've
 come
 to


understand
 about
 the
 perspective
 of


people
 like
 Dr.
 Bura
 and
 and
 Jews
 in


general
 in
 New
 York
 who
 are
 in
 the
 same


way
 perhaps
 that
 police
 were
 grappling


with
 what
 you
 were
 saying
 about
 them


grappling
 with
 the
 way
 you
 talk
 about


Israel.


I
 would
 distinguish
 one
 piece
 in
 that
 my


use
 of
 the
 term
 genocide
 is
 not


a
 personal
 opinion
 rather
 it's
 a


reflection
 of
 findings
 by


institutions
 even
 of
 genocide
 scholars


themselves
 institutions
 like
 the
 United


Nations


and


it
 is
 a
 word
 that
 reflects
 what
 has
 been


happening
 in
 Gaza


And


these
 conversations
 that
 I've
 been


having
 both
 since
 the
 primary,
 but
 also


frankly
 prior
 to
 the
 primary,


have
 been
 illuminating
 for
 me
 in
 both


having
 an
 opportunity
 to
 meet
 many
 New


Yorkers,
 especially
 Jewish
 New
 Yorkers,


for
 whom
 their
 only
 impression
 of
 me
 was


through
 a
 caricature,
 whether
 it
 be
 a


caricature.


>> What
 was
 that
 caricature,
 do
 you
 think?


Well,
 you
 know,
 I
 had
 the
 distinct


pleasure
 of
 having
 around
 $30
 million


spent
 against
 me
 in
 the
 primary,
 and
 it


was
 $30
 million
 that
 was
 spent
 in


mailers,
 in
 TV
 ads.


>> I
 saw
 some
 of
 those
 mailers.
 They
 were


some
 of
 them
 were
 rather
 vivid.


>> There
 there
 was
 a
 mailer
 sent
 by
 Andrew


Cuomo
 super
 PAC
 that
 artificially


lengthened
 my
 beard.


And
 there
 was
 another
 mailer
 sent
 by


another
 candidate.


>> So
 So
 that
 you
 were
 more
 menacingly


>> Yes.


>> something.
 and
 and
 it
 specifically
 chose


to
 feature
 a
 photo
 of
 me
 in
 a
 korta.


And
 there
 was
 another
 mailer
 sent
 by


another
 candidate
 that


implied
 I
 was
 going
 to
 kill
 Jewish
 New


Yorkers.


>> Part
 of
 the
 earlier
 conversation
 we
 were


having
 about
 the
 Democratic
 party.


>> Mhm.


>> These
 are
 mailers
 that
 were
 sent
 in
 a


Democratic
 primary.
 M
 and
 so
 if
 you're
 a


Jewish
 New
 Yorker
 and
 you're
 receiving


these
 kinds
 of
 mailers,
 you're
 opening


an
 article
 that
 you're
 reading
 and


you're
 reading
 this
 kind
 of
 a
 caricature


of
 me.
 I
 do
 not
 begrudge
 skepticism.
 I


do
 not
 begrudge
 concern.


And


what
 I've
 appreciated
 about
 these


conversations
 is
 an
 opportunity
 to
 share


who
 I
 am
 and
 the
 opinions
 and
 thoughts


and
 commitments
 that
 may
 be
 in


disagreement
 with
 those
 on
 the
 other
 end


of
 the
 table,
 but
 at
 the
 very
 least
 can


show
 that
 these
 are
 thoughts
 that
 are


built
 on
 a
 belief
 in
 a
 universal


system
 of
 human
 rights.
 It's
 the


opportunity
 to
 make
 clear
 that,
 you


know,
 I've
 I've
 had
 a
 number
 of
 Jewish


New
 Yorkers
 ask
 me,


you've
 said
 you
 recognize
 Israel
 right


to
 exist,
 but
 you
 won't
 recognize
 its


right
 to
 exist
 as
 a
 Jewish
 state.
 Would


that
 be
 the
 case
 for


Saudi
 Arabia?
 And
 I've
 said
 absolutely


it
 would
 be
 because
 my
 belief


>> So
 your
 objections
 remain
 equal.
 Yes.


For
 any
 Saudi
 Arabia,
 UAE
 as
 they
 do
 to


Israel.
 for
 any
 state,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


recognize
 its
 right
 to
 be
 a
 state
 with
 a


hierarchy
 of
 citizenship
 on
 the
 basis


whether
 it
 be
 of
 religion
 or
 race.
 And


part
 of
 that
 is
 because
 especially
 as
 an


American
 thinking
 of
 the
 importance
 of
 a


state
 which
 enshrines
 equal
 rights


within
 it


>> and
 to
 make
 clear
 that
 my
 critiques
 of


Israel
 are
 critiques
 that
 I
 would
 hold


for
 any
 other
 state
 violating
 any
 one
 of


these
 other
 international
 laws.
 And
 the


focus


that
 I
 and
 many
 other
 New
 Yorkers
 have


had
 on
 the
 question
 specifically
 of


Israel's
 violations
 of
 these


international
 human
 rights
 is
 also
 in


part
 because
 of
 our
 unique
 complicity
 as


Americans
 in
 those
 violations.
 You
 mean


because
 of
 the
 American
 funding
 of
 the


war
 in
 Gaza


>> and
 prior
 to
 that
 and
 the
 nature
 of


sending,
 you
 know,
 $4
 billion
 a
 year


every
 year
 prior
 to
 this.
 One
 of
 your


critiques
 of
 the
 Democratic
 Party,
 it


feels
 worth
 mentioning
 this
 here
 is
 Pep


progressive
 except
 for
 for
 Palestinians


and
 I
 think
 given
 your
 last
 answer,
 I
 I


understand
 the
 argument
 there
 that


democratic
 elected
 officials
 have
 in


your
 estimation
 excluded
 Palestinians


from
 their
 sense
 of
 a
 kind
 of
 global


universal
 justice.


You
 well
 understand
 that
 previous
 mayors


to
 you
 have
 not
 put
 the
 same
 emphasis
 on


Palestinian
 rights
 and
 have
 I'm
 thinking


in
 the
 case
 of
 Mike
 Bloomberg
 personally


donated
 tremendous
 amounts
 of
 money
 to


social
 services
 in
 Israel
 or
 in
 the
 case


of
 Mayor
 Adams
 visited
 Israel.
 Mayor


Adams
 ran
 in
 2021
 with
 a
 promise
 that
 he


would
 retire
 in
 the
 Golden
 Heights


>> occupied.
 He
 he
 not
 only
 visited
 Israel,


he
 met
 with
 settlement
 leaders
 and
 came


back
 promising
 to
 increase
 cooperation


with
 them.


>> Well,
 we're
 at
 this
 really
 interesting


moment.
 There's
 now
 a
 ceasefire,


potentially
 a
 peace
 process.
 And
 because


of
 that
 history
 of
 the
 way
 New
 York
 City


mayors
 have
 treated
 Israel,


because
 I
 I
 take
 the
 critique
 of


journalists
 when
 people
 say
 he's
 running


for
 mayor,
 not
 for
 leader
 of
 the
 free


world,
 not
 for
 envoy
 to
 the
 Middle
 East.


But
 I
 am
 curious
 since
 you
 raised
 it
 and


since
 Jewish
 New
 Yorkers
 ask
 you,


including
 at
 Temple
 Beth
 Ethohim,
 I


think
 on
 Sunday,
 which
 version
 of
 Israel


you
 can
 support


because
 of
 your
 profound
 critique
 of


Israel.
 I
 am
 curious
 if
 you
 can
 be
 a


little
 specific
 because
 we
 are
 now
 in


that
 moment
 where
 potentially
 a
 new


Middle
 East
 may
 be
 born.
 Is
 there
 a


version
 of
 Israel
 that
 you
 could
 be


comfortable
 with
 and
 maybe
 even
 as


almost
 all
 mayors
 have
 in
 the
 past


visit?


I've
 said
 and
 I
 and
 I
 continue
 to


believe
 that
 one
 need
 not
 visit
 Israel


to
 stand
 up
 for
 Jewish
 New
 Yorkers.
 And


I've
 also
 said
 in
 the
 question
 of


visiting
 countries
 outside
 of
 ours
 that


my
 focus
 is
 going
 to
 be
 on
 New
 York


City.
 And


my
 belief
 whether
 it
 be
 for
 Israel
 and


Palestine
 or
 anywhere
 across
 the
 world


is
 the
 importance
 of
 equal
 rights
 as


part
 of
 any
 future
 that
 we're
 fighting


for.
 And


>> as
 you
 said,
 I
 am
 running
 to
 be
 the


mayor
 of
 the
 city.
 And
 I
 also
 know
 to


your
 point
 that
 there
 are
 millions
 of


New
 Yorkers,
 myself
 included,
 who
 care


deeply
 about
 Israel
 and
 Palestine.
 And


my
 desire
 is
 to
 be
 a
 mayor
 who
 is
 both


clear
 in
 my
 belief
 in
 universal
 human


rights,
 the
 necessity
 of
 extending
 those


beliefs
 of
 freedom
 and
 safety
 and


justice
 and
 equality
 to
 all
 people,
 and


that
 that
 must
 also
 include


Palestinians.


and
 that
 my
 job
 in
 leading
 the
 city
 is


to
 embody
 that
 shared
 sense
 of
 humanity.


>> I'm
 hearing
 you
 say
 an
 injustice


anywhere
 is
 essentially
 an
 injustice
 to


everywhere,
 to
 everything.


>> Yes,
 I
 I
 would
 say
 that
 that's
 correct.


And
 and
 I
 think
 what's
 what's
 been
 gling


to
 many
 in
 this
 city
 has
 been
 the


ability
 to
 be
 blind
 to
 certain


injustices.


>> We
 have
 a
 mayor
 right
 now


who
 has
 often
 been
 blind
 to
 the


suffering
 of
 many
 in
 this
 city,


especially
 I
 would
 say
 Palestinian
 New


Yorkers.
 I
 met
 a
 Palestinian
 New
 Yorker


from
 Bay
 Ridge
 about
 two
 weeks
 ago.
 It's


an
 older
 man
 walked
 with
 a
 cane.


>> Mhm.


>> We
 were
 having
 chai
 in
 Atoria


and
 he
 told
 me
 how
 he'd
 lived
 in
 this


city
 for
 decades.
 He's
 from
 Gaza
 and
 for


decades
 he
 worked
 to
 save
 up
 to
 build
 a


house
 in
 Gaza.
 Mhm.


>> And
 he
 built
 that
 house
 and
 it
 was
 the


pride
 and
 joy
 of
 his
 life.
 And
 the


Israeli
 military
 destroyed
 that
 house
 in


one
 minute.
 And
 in
 the
 rubble
 of
 that


house
 lay
 the
 dreams
 that
 he
 had
 held


for
 decades.
 And
 how
 his
 son


and
 his
 grandkids
 were
 in
 Gaza,
 continue


to
 be
 in
 Gaza
 today.
 And
 he
 told
 me


about
 how
 his
 son
 called
 him
 the
 other


week
 and
 said,


"Listen,
 listen
 to
 my
 son."
 He
 gave
 the


phone
 over
 to
 this
 man's
 grandchild
 and


the
 grandchild
 said,
 "I'm
 hungry.
 Can


you
 send
 me
 anything?"
 And
 this
 man
 had


to
 grapple
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 there
 was


nothing
 more
 he
 could
 send.
 There
 was
 no


way
 he
 could
 reach
 out.
 This
 is
 a
 New


Yorker.


>> I'm
 just
 noting
 the
 emotion
 in
 your


voice
 here.
 it
 because
 I
 think
 there's


no
 other
 way
 to
 respond
 to
 to
 this
 kind


of
 despair
 and
 to
 hold
 this
 despair
 and


say
 that
 as
 the
 mayor
 of
 your
 city,
 I


see
 what
 you
 are
 struggling
 through
 and


the
 very
 least
 you
 deserve
 as
 someone


who
 looks
 at
 you
 with
 the
 full
 humanity


you
 deserve.
 And
 that's
 what
 I
 want
 to


bring
 is
 as
 a
 real
 belief
 in
 a
 shared


sense
 of
 humanity
 for
 all
 because
 for


far
 too
 long
 there
 have
 been
 exceptions


that
 have
 been
 carved
 out.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Even
 if
 you're
 able
 to
 convince
 all


these
 constituencies
 that
 you
 are
 the


right
 candidate
 to
 be
 mayor
 in
 this


general
 election,
 a
 safe
 candidate,
 more


than
 safe,
 desirable,


the
 argument
 can
 be
 made
 that
 there
 is


because
 of
 President
 Trump
 something


profoundly
 unsafe
 in
 theory
 about
 your


election,
 entirely
 out
 of
 your
 control,


which
 is
 that
 if
 you're
 elected,
 and


Trump
 said
 this,
 he'll
 target
 New
 York,


he'll
 target
 you.
 The
 pretense
 might
 be


crime.
 It
 might
 be
 illegal
 immigration.


I
 think
 you've
 used
 this
 word.
 It's
 an


inevitability
 if
 you
 become
 elected.


Can
 you
 understand
 why
 that
 might
 be
 a


complicating
 factor
 in
 people's
 decision


to
 vote
 for
 you?
 As
 unfair
 as
 it
 would


be
 to
 you,
 what
 I've
 described
 as


inevitability
 is
 Donald
 Trump's
 desire


to
 send
 the
 National
 Guard
 to
 New
 York


City.
 And
 what
 I
 would
 say
 to
 those
 who


would
 say
 this
 argument,
 whomever
 they


may
 be,


>> wherever
 they
 may
 be,


>> whatever
 former
 governor,


>> whatever
 former
 governor,
 whoever
 you


know,
 Andrew
 Coma
 living
 in
 Westchester


may
 be,
 um,
 is
 that


Donald
 Trump
 is
 not
 waiting
 for
 me
 to
 be


the
 mayor
 to
 enact
 this
 kind
 of


political
 retribution.
 He
 had
 arguably


the
 most
 collaborative
 mayor
 he
 could


find
 in
 Eric
 Adams.
 And
 even
 with
 that


mayor,
 he
 pulled
 $80
 million
 out
 of a


city
 bank
 account.
 He
 suspended
 $50


million
 in
 funding
 because
 the
 city


refused
 to
 give
 up,


>> but
 kept
 the
 National
 Guard
 at
 bay.


>> Yes.
 While


looking
 to
 suspend
 $18
 billion
 in


federal
 infrastructure
 funding
 in
 no


small
 part


because
 of
 Democrats
 at
 the
 national


level
 refusing
 to
 allow
 him
 to
 throw
 4


million
 Americans
 off
 of
 their


healthcare.
 My
 point
 being
 that


retribution
 is
 not
 something
 that
 will


only
 appear
 in
 this
 city
 by
 virtue
 of
 my


being
 mayor.
 It's
 already
 a
 feature
 of


what
 it
 looks
 like
 to
 live
 on
 in
 Donald


Trump's
 America.


>> And
 what
 we've
 seen,
 whether
 it
 be
 in


his
 first
 administration
 or
 now
 in
 his


second
 administration,
 is
 that
 Donald


Trump,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 stand
 up
 to
 him,


the
 first
 thing
 you
 have
 to
 do
 is
 be


able
 to
 actually
 be
 willing
 to
 fight


him.
 And
 what
 we
 have
 in
 this
 moment


is
 not
 just
 my
 campaign,
 but
 Andrew


Cuomo's,
 which
 is
 one
 that
 is
 so
 unable


to
 stand
 up
 to
 him
 in
 large
 part
 because


of
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 knows
 his
 narrow


path
 to
 city
 hall
 is
 paved
 by
 the
 very


donors
 who
 gave
 us
 Donald
 Trump's
 second


term,
 which
 is
 why
 there's
 there's


overlap.
 When
 he
 was
 asked
 would
 he


condemn
 Donald
 Trump
 for
 the


weaponization
 of
 justice
 in
 the


prosecution
 of
 Attorney
 General
 Tish


James,
 he
 said
 condemn
 him
 for
 what?
 He


released
 a
 statement
 on
 the


weaponization
 that
 refused
 to
 name


either
 Donald
 Trump
 or
 Tish
 James.
 And


so
 my
 my
 point
 being
 there
 already


exists
 retribution
 here
 in
 this
 city
 the


likes
 of
 which
 that
 has
 immense


consequences.
 We
 have
 a
 candidate
 who
 is


running
 on
 the
 promise
 of
 being
 able
 to


stand
 up
 to
 Trump
 while
 he
 can't
 even


name
 him.
 And
 what
 I
 will
 do
 is
 no
 doubt


face
 these
 kinds
 of
 threats,
 including


those
 that
 have
 been
 made
 about


deporting
 me,
 arresting
 me,


denaturalizing
 me.


>> I
 will
 face
 them
 knowing
 that
 just
 by


virtue
 of
 Donald
 Trump
 saying
 something,


it
 doesn't
 make
 it
 law.
 What
 actually


makes
 it
 law
 is
 when
 we
 go
 through
 the


court
 system.
 And
 what
 we've
 seen
 is
 a


approach
 in
 California
 where
 the


attorney
 general,
 the
 mayor
 of
 LA,
 the


governor
 of
 the
 state
 came
 together
 to


file
 a
 lawsuit
 that
 where
 a
 federal


judge
 recently
 found
 in
 their
 favor
 the


deployment
 of
 the
 National
 Guard
 was


illegal.
 And
 also
 an
 attorney
 general


who
 found
 that
 for
 every
 dollar
 that


they
 spent
 on
 legal
 fees,
 they
 were
 able


to
 recover
 more
 than
 30,000
 in
 federal


funds
 that
 would
 have
 otherwise
 been


stripped
 of
 them.
 Ultimately,
 a
 major


reason
 why
 Trump
 might
 intervene
 in
 New


York
 would
 be
 part
 of
 an
 ICE
 campaign
 to


round
 up
 and
 deport
 undocumented


immigrants.
 That's
 been
 an
 argument


pretense
 he's
 made
 in
 several
 places


where
 the
 National
 Guard
 eventually


comes.
 There
 are
 an
 estimated
 400,000


undocumented
 immigrants
 in
 New
 York.
 And


as
 you
 found
 as
 you
 ran
 this
 primary


that
 was
 so
 successful
 and
 you
 met
 with


many
 Trumpup
 supporting
 New
 Yorkers
 who


have
 turned
 around
 and
 supported
 you
 is


that
 their
 viewpoint
 on
 these
 issues
 is


complicated
 and
 many
 of
 them
 have


serious
 objections
 to
 the
 level
 of


undocumented
 immigration
 in
 a
 place
 like


New
 York
 City.


But
 I
 don't
 hear
 from
 your
 campaign
 that


you're
 going
 to
 be
 participating
 in
 any


Trump-led
 effort
 to
 detain,
 deport


undocumented
 immigrants.


Why
 not?


I'm
 not
 looking
 to
 assist
 Donald
 Trump


in
 his
 attempt
 to
 fulfill
 his
 campaign


promise
 to
 create
 the
 single
 largest


deportation
 force
 in
 American
 history.


I'm
 not
 looking
 to
 do
 so
 because
 even
 if


you
 know
 that
 some
 of
 your
 maybe
 perhaps


many
 of
 your
 supporters
 do
 want
 illegal


immigration
 to
 be
 treated
 differently


than
 it
 has.
 What
 I've
 heard
 from
 my


supporters
 and
 what
 I've
 heard
 from
 New


Yorkers,
 frankly,
 is
 a
 desire
 for


dignity.
 And
 in
 looking
 at
 what
 ICE's


presence
 has
 been
 in
 New
 York
 City,
 what


it
 has
 meant
 for
 our
 city,
 seeing
 at
 the


very
 least
 an
 absence
 of
 that,
 and
 in


fact
 an
 attack
 not
 only
 on
 the
 question


of
 dignity,
 by
 the
 very
 fabric
 of
 the


city,
 right?
 Where
 there
 are
 New
 Yorkers


I
 know
 of
 who
 took
 down
 the
 numbers
 on


every
 apartment
 on
 their
 floor
 so
 that


ICE
 wouldn't
 know
 where
 anyone
 lived.


>> Wow.
 I
 spoke
 to
 a
 Dominican
 barber
 shop


owner
 in
 Harlem
 who
 told
 me
 that
 all
 of


his
 barbers
 have
 legal
 status
 and
 they


are
 terrified
 of
 coming
 to
 work.
 A


general
 sense
 of
 the
 hollowing
 out
 of


the
 immigrant
 hubs
 of
 this
 city.
 And
 no,


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 help
 Donald
 Trump
 in


doing
 so.
 I'm
 in
 fact
 going
 to
 fight


Donald
 Trump
 when
 he
 looks
 to
 tear


families
 apart.
 And
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 so


because
 I
 know
 what
 the
 stakes
 are.
 When


when
 he
 detains
 a
 six-year-old
 girl
 from


Queens
 and
 deports
 her,
 I
 know
 that
 her


principal
 is
 writing
 a
 letter
 to
 ICE


saying,
 "Please
 don't
 do
 this."


>> I
 mean,
 here
 you're
 saying
 the
 method


can't
 be
 separated
 from
 the
 goal,
 and


you're
 rejecting
 the
 method
 because


you're
 rejecting
 the
 goal.
 I
 mean,


that's
 that's
 very
 clear.


>> I
 I
 think
 also
 I
 reject
 the
 goal.
 It's


not
 just
 the
 the
 manner
 in
 which
 this


detention
 is
 happening.
 It's
 the
 fact


that
 the
 the
 goal
 here
 is
 cruelty.
 The


goal
 is
 to
 rip
 these
 families
 apart
 and


the
 goal
 is
 to
 attack
 so
 much
 of
 what
 is


the
 foundation
 of
 this
 city
 as
 an


immigrant
 city.


>> Would
 you
 ever
 meet
 with
 President
 Trump


in
 the
 hope
 that
 you
 could
 defang
 this


person,
 this
 president
 who
 may
 have
 ill


will
 toward
 you,
 but
 frankly
 doesn't


really
 know
 you
 at
 all.


>> Absolutely.
 I
 will
 meet
 with
 President


Trump.
 I
 think
 it's
 incumbent
 upon
 any


mayor
 of
 this
 city
 to
 meet
 with
 the


president
 of
 the
 country.
 What
 I
 won't


do
 is
 work
 with
 President
 Trump
 at
 the


expense
 of
 the
 city.
 That's
 that's
 the


critique
 that
 I've
 made
 of
 of
 Andrew


Cuomo
 and
 of
 Eric
 Adams
 is
 that
 their


conversations
 with
 Trump
 have
 more
 to
 do


with
 themselves
 than
 to
 do
 with
 the


people
 of
 the
 city.
 It's
 not
 that


they're
 talking,


>> it's
 that
 who
 are
 they
 talking
 to
 him


about.


>> I
 want
 to
 end
 this
 conversation
 on
 the


movement
 that
 you've
 quite
 clearly


created
 in
 New
 York
 City.
 It's
 a


movement
 we
 saw
 on
 vivid
 display
 last


night
 that
 argues
 that
 the
 democratic


politics
 of
 the
 modern
 era,
 the
 old


formulas,
 I
 that
 word
 resonated
 last


night
 when
 you
 said
 it,
 have
 failed
 and


that
 you
 can
 replace
 it
 with
 something


new.
 And
 in
 your
 speech
 at
 this
 rally
 we


all
 went
 to,
 you
 likened
 it
 to
 the
 great


movements
 of
 American
 history,
 civil


rights
 movement,
 the
 movement
 for
 labor


rights
 that
 created
 the
 modern
 weekend


where
 workers
 can
 take
 a
 break,
 the
 New


Deal
 and
 the
 birth
 of
 the
 social
 safety


net.


That
 sets
 expectations
 pretty
 high.
 I'm


not
 sure
 you
 can
 get
 much
 higher
 and


there's
 nobility
 in
 that
 and
 there's


real
 risk
 in
 that.
 And
 so
 do
 you
 worry


that
 it
 will
 be
 hard
 to
 deliver
 on
 those


expectations?


You're
 pretty
 new
 to
 management
 on
 this


scale.


And
 if
 it's
 impossible
 or
 even
 really


difficult
 to
 deliver,
 what
 does
 it
 do
 to


this
 movement?


I'm
 glad
 I
 won't
 have
 to
 answer
 the


hypothetical
 because
 I
 fully
 intend
 to


deliver
 and
 we
 have
 to.
 We
 came
 to
 these


policies,
 to
 these
 commitments
 not


because
 of
 a
 poll
 that
 we
 commissioned


or
 a
 consultant
 that
 we
 sat
 with.


>> In
 fact,
 the
 polls
 said
 that
 you
 should


focus
 on
 public
 safety.


>> Not
 also
 had
 me
 tied
 with
 someone
 else.


>> Literally,


>> literally
 anybody
 else
 and
 I
 beat
 that


guy.


But
 I
 I
 I
 I
 say
 this
 to
 say
 that
 it's


New
 Yorkers
 who
 told
 us
 it
 was
 housing.


It's
 New
 Yorkers
 who
 told
 us
 it
 was


childare.
 It's
 New
 Yorkers
 who
 told
 us


it
 was
 the
 slowest
 buses
 in
 America.


And
 the
 necessity
 of
 fulfilling
 these


commitments
 are
 also
 to
 ensure
 that


those
 New
 Yorkers
 stay
 New
 Yorkers.
 They


continue
 to
 see
 themselves
 in
 this
 city.


And
 the
 only
 way
 we
 can
 do
 so
 is
 if
 they


see
 their
 struggles
 in
 our
 politics.


And


there
 are
 many
 politicians
 who
 will
 tell


you
 that
 the
 best
 life
 could
 ever
 be
 is


the
 one
 that
 you're
 living
 in
 right
 now.


And
 those
 are
 also
 the
 ones
 who
 have


paved
 the
 way
 for
 the
 politics
 we've


seen
 of
 Donald
 Trump
 because
 you
 have
 to


be
 able
 to
 reckon
 with
 the
 material


needs
 of
 working
 people
 and
 the
 fact


that
 so
 many
 of
 them
 are
 going
 unmet.


>> Right.
 Sounds
 like
 you're
 saying,
 "I


know
 what
 I
 believe.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


compromise
 on
 my
 values
 and
 my


administration
 will
 not
 compromise
 on
 my


values
 and
 that
 will
 be
 enough."
 This
 is


like
 my
 translator.


>> Perhaps
 it
 will
 be
 enough.


>> Assemblyman
 Zoron,


>> Mr.
 Mr.
 Mandani,
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 for


your
 time.


>> Thank you
 very
 much.
 It's
 a
 pleasure.


>> Good
 luck
 to
 you.


>> Thank
 you.
 Same
 to
 you.


>> Oh,
 yes.
 Well,
 we're
 doing
 a
 quick


interview
 photo.


>> Yes.
 Should
 we
 do
 one
 of
 those


politician
 handshakes
 or
 no?


>> No,
 no,
 no,
 no.


Later
 tonight,
 Zoron
 Mandani
 will


participate
 in
 the
 first
 general


election
 debate
 of
 the
 mayor's
 race,


where
 he'll
 face
 off
 against
 Andrew


Cuomo,
 now
 running
 as
 an
 independent,


and
 Curtis
 Siwa,
 a
 Republican.
 The


debate
 begins
 at
 700
 p.m.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's


what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.
 The


Times
 reports
 that
 the
 Trump


administration
 has
 secretly
 authorized


the
 CIA
 to
 conduct
 covert
 action
 in


Venezuela,
 a
 major
 escalation
 in
 its


campaign
 against
 the
 country's


authoritarian
 leader,
 Nicholas
 Madura.


The
 US
 military
 has
 already
 been


destroying
 boats
 off
 Venezuela's
 coast


that
 it
 claims
 are
 transporting
 drugs.


And
 in
 private
 conversations,
 US


officials
 are
 now
 making
 it
 clear
 that


their
 end
 goal
 is
 to
 drive
 Maduro
 from


power.


And
 in
 oral
 arguments
 on
 Wednesday,
 the


Supreme
 Court's
 conservative
 majority


appeared
 ready
 to
 challenge
 a
 key


provision
 of
 the
 Voting
 Rights
 Act
 of


1965
 by
 prohibiting
 state
 lawmakers
 from


using
 race
 as
 a
 factor
 in
 drawing


election
 maps.
 If
 the
 court
 decides
 that


race
 may
 not
 be
 used
 in
 such
 maps,
 it


could
 allow
 Republican
 legislators
 to


eliminate
 at
 least
 a
 dozen
 Democratic


held
 house
 seats
 across
 the
 South.
