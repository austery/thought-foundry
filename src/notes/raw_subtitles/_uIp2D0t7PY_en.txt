Joining

 right

 Terry
 Weissman,


director
 of

 currency's
 interest


rate
 strategy
 at
 Mccquary.
 Terry,
 I
 feel


like
 we're
 at
 Bear
 Sterns
 years
 ago.
 I


got
 to
 get
 right
 to
 the
 dollar
 and
 once


again,
 consensus
 is
 hammered.
 What


happens
 in
 the
 foreign
 exchange
 market


when
 everybody
 gets
 it
 wrong?


Well,
 it
 depends
 how
 they're
 positioned,


I
 suppose.
 If


a
 lot
 of
 people
 were
 betting
 weak


dollar,
 right?


Absolutely.
 As
 as
 have
 we
 been


in
 the
 medium
 and
 long
 term.
 Well,
 you


got
 to
 stop
 the
 show.
 We
 have
 the


Harvard
 foot
 co
 football
 coach
 on


yesterday.
 Tonight,
 Friday
 Night


Football,
 Harvard.
 Yep.

 We wisman
 hears


us
 and
 he
 has
 to
 wear
 the
 Yale
 hat
 to


straighten
 I
 guess
 an
 offsprings
 at
 Yale


or
 something.
 The
 good
 morning
 offspring


of
 Terry
 Weissman
 killing
 it
 at
 Yale
 and


biology.
 Continue
 on
 the
 bet
 that
 was


made
 in
 weak
 dollar.
 The
 bet
 that
 was


made
 in
 the
 in
 in
 the
 well
 the
 bet
 that


was
 made
 in
 the
 strong
 dollar
 throughout


most
 of
 this
 year
 was
 a
 bet
 made
 on
 the


premise
 that
 policy
 uncertainty
 would


continue
 in
 the
 US
 that
 you
 would
 see


see
 reserve
 managers
 rotate
 out
 of
 the


dollar
 that
 this
 would
 be
 followed
 by


private
 asset
 allocators
 including
 fixed


income
 allocators
 move
 out
 of
 the


dollar.
 It
 was
 also
 predicated
 on
 the


richness
 of
 the
 dollar.
 We've
 seen
 a


real
 appreciation
 of
 the
 dollar
 for
 the


past
 13
 years
 and
 that
 was
 a
 great
 story


and
 I
 think
 people
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 money


uh
 betting
 on
 on
 on
 that
 weakness
 in
 the


dollar
 until
 until
 the
 last
 few
 weeks.


what's
 happened
 in
 the
 last
 few
 weeks
 I


think
 is
 is
 is
 not
 unusual.
 Um
 I
 think


what
 has
 happened
 is
 that
 people
 have


realized
 traders
 have
 realized
 that
 hey


there's
 just
 as
 much
 political


uncertainty
 and
 policy
 uncertainty
 in


the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 in
 some
 of
 these


key
 markets
 as
 there
 is
 in
 the
 US
 and


the
 case
 in
 point
 of
 course
 has
 been


Europe
 with
 these
 uh
 with
 the
 with
 this


uh
 with
 this
 uh
 the
 prospect
 that
 we
 may


see
 uh
 a
 socialist
 become
 the
 prime


minister
 of
 France
 that
 we
 may
 see
 delay


to
 pension
 reform
 uh
 that
 we
 will
 see


France
 not
 solve
 its
 its
 deficit
 and


debt
 issue
 and
 of
 course
 now
 Japan
 as


well
 uh
 with
 concerns
 over
 whether
 or
 or


not
 this
 ruling
 coalition
 um
 uh
 will


will
 will
 maintain
 power
 and
 whether
 we


go
 to
 early
 elections
 there
 potentially


parliamentary
 elections.
 So
 look
 as
 long


as
 the
 US
 looked
 to
 be
 the
 only
 source


of
 uncertainty
 it
 was
 a
 weak
 dollar


story.
 Now
 that
 the
 US
 is
 not
 the
 only


source
 of
 uncertainty
 it
 becomes
 a


strong
 dollar
 story.


Does
 the
 dollar
 retrace
 that
 89%
 decline


it's
 had
 around?


I
 don't
 think
 so.
 Although
 it's
 hard
 to


predict
 uh
 the
 headlines
 coming
 out
 out


of
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 in
 part
 because


the
 nature
 of
 uncertainty
 is
 that
 it


becomes
 hard
 to
 predict.


Uh
 but
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 that
 the
 dollar


had
 gotten
 so
 rich
 uh
 over
 the
 last
 13


years
 and
 had
 gotten
 to
 a
 point
 9
 months


ago
 where
 it
 was
 probably
 a
 level
 on


sustainability
 in
 its
 valuation.
 I
 just


don't
 see
 it
 getting
 back
 to
 the
 levels


of
 of
 February
 uh
 uh
 and
 March
 of
 this


year.
 explain
 to
 those
 across
 America


listening
 and
 watching
 why
 we
 should


care
 about
 Japanese
 yen.
 I
 saw
 a
 couple


really
 good
 essays
 on
 this
 yesterday,


but
 I
 think
 it
 needs
 to
 be
 repeated.


Yeah.
 So,
 look,
 if
 if
 you're
 a
 stock


market
 investor
 and
 let's
 take
 it
 from


the
 perspective,
 not
 a
 policy
 maker,
 but


an
 investor
 because
 I
 I
 want
 to
 appeal


to
 the
 to
 the
 readership
 here.
 uh
 if
 you


are
 invested
 in
 Japanese
 stocks
 and
 a


lot
 of
 these
 stocks
 are
 are


multinational
 stocks.
 They
 they
 sell
 you


know
 uh
 very
 high
 value
 added
 industrial


products
 to
 the
 rest
 of the
 world
 their


margins
 their
 operating
 margins
 benefit


from
 a
 weak
 end.
 So
 uh
 that's
 one
 reason


why
 you
 need
 to
 pay
 attention
 to
 this.


In
 fact,
 with
 the
 weakness
 of
 the
 sorry,


with
 the
 weakness
 of
 the
 yen
 that
 we've


seen
 in
 the
 last
 few
 few
 days
 uh
 since


the
 political
 turmoil,
 the
 stock


market's
 done
 fantastically,
 which
 which


seems
 to
 suggest
 to
 me
 that
 that
 the


weakness
 of
 the
 yen
 is
 not
 so
 much
 a


fundamental
 thing
 as
 much
 as
 it
 is
 a
 a a


prediliction
 on
 the
 part
 of
 investors
 to


to
 wonder
 what
 is
 the
 central
 bank
 going


to
 do.
 It's
 not
 about
 a
 weakening
 of
 the


of
 the
 Japanese
 economy.


I
 was
 tackled
 by
 a
 Morgan
 Stanley
 guy


yesterday
 and
 we
 were
 talking
 about


this,
 Dan
 Skelly,
 who's
 a
 big
 Dan


Skellyy
 fan.
 And
 I
 thought
 Dan
 was
 on


last
 time
 I
 was
 on
 was
 great.
 And
 and


the
 guy
 said
 to
 me,
 he
 he
 said,
 "This


yen
 is
 hugely
 disabling."
 And
 the
 heart


of
 the
 matter,
 their
 wages
 have


disappeared.
 Yeah.


They're
 like
 England
 in
 1930
 in
 terms
 of


real
 wages.


Yep.
 Terry,
 we
 got
 a
 government
 shutdown


here
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Um,
 is
 that


going
 to
 affect
 our
 Federal
 Reserve
 here


over
 the
 next
 several
 meetings,
 do
 you


think?


Yeah,
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 I
 mean,
 if
 what


you're
 referring
 to
 is
 the
 premise
 that


because
 of
 a
 lack
 of
 official
 data,
 the


Federal
 Reserve
 will
 not
 know
 what
 to


do,
 I
 I
 would
 I
 would
 take
 issue
 with


that.
 There's
 plenty
 of
 third
 party


data,
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 itself


conducts
 surveys.
 It
 collects
 data.
 It


will
 have
 that
 at
 hand
 when
 the
 when
 the


meeting
 takes
 place
 on
 October
 28th
 and


29th
 to
 make
 an
 informed
 decision
 about


where
 the
 economy
 is
 going.
 Uh
 it


doesn't
 rely
 just
 on
 official
 data.
 To


say
 that
 you're
 data
 dependent
 does
 not


mean
 that
 you're
 officially
 data


dependent.
 It
 means
 that
 you're
 just


data
 dependent.
 uh
 uh
 so
 I
 I
 I
 think


they'll
 have
 enough
 data.
 Look,
 my
 view


on
 the
 Fed
 is
 that
 there
 is
 sufficient


reason
 to
 believe
 that
 uh
 uh
 interest


rate
 policy
 in
 the
 US
 right
 now
 is
 not


uh
 overly
 restrictive.
 Uh
 if
 it
 were,
 we


wouldn't
 be
 seeing
 the
 stock
 market
 at


new
 highs.
 We
 wouldn't
 be
 seeing
 gold


ripping.
 We
 wouldn't
 be
 seeing
 corporate


bond
 spreads
 as
 narrow
 as
 they've


gotten.
 I
 think
 the
 Fed
 needs
 to
 take


all
 of
 that
 into
 consideration.
 If
 they


do
 cut,
 it
 will
 be
 a
 very
 reluctant
 cut.


uh
 I
 I
 think
 in
 view
 of
 what
 the


financial
 markets
 have
 been
 doing.


So
 I
 mean
 is
 the
 cadence
 here
 of
 the
 Fed


is
 it


meeting
 by
 meeting?
 Do
 they
 you
 think


they
 have
 a
 strategy
 of
 let's
 cut
 a


couple
 times
 this
 year
 then
 cut
 early


next
 year
 then
 we'll
 sit
 back


if
 that
 um
 I
 I
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 Jay


Powell
 said
 on
 on
 September
 17th
 I
 mean


practically
 admitted
 that
 that
 the
 cut


they
 made
 in
 September
 was
 an
 insurance


cut.
 That
 seems
 to
 suggest
 that
 they're


not
 necessarily
 on
 a
 path
 to
 cut
 two
 or


three
 more
 times
 and
 wait.
 It
 really


does
 suggest
 that
 the
 cut
 was
 only


intended
 to
 strike
 a
 balance
 uh
 between


the
 the
 two
 mandates
 within
 the
 dual


mandates
 a
 little
 bit
 better
 and
 it
 does


not
 imply
 a
 long
 and
 profound
 series
 of


rate
 cuts.


We
 are
 fortunate
 at
 uh
 Bloomberg


Surveillance
 to
 have
 Terry
 Weissman
 with


us
 this
 morning
 from
 McQuary
 with
 all
 of


his
 uh
 experience.
 These
 headlines
 out.


This
 is
 CNBC
 driving
 the
 story
 uh


forward.
 The
 president's
 fed
 chair


candidates
 list.
 It's
 narrowed
 down
 to


five
 by
 the
 secretary
 of
 treasury.
 Um


the
 list
 here
 is
 it
 sounds
 like
 a
 these


guys
 for
 good.
 They
 play
 Crosby
 Stills


and
 Nash
 Great.
 Bowman
 Waller
 Hasset


Walsh
 Ryder
 of
 Black
 Rockck
 in
 the
 final


five.
 And
 I
 would
 suggest
 none
 of
 those


are
 a
 surprise
 within
 the
 Fed
 Derby


Zeitgeist.
 I
 defer
 to
 Mike
 McKe
 on
 that.


Chair
 Weissman,
 is
 this
 the
 way
 to
 pick


a
 chairman


by
 by
 headlines
 and
 interviews
 and


No,
 no,
 you
 don't
 you
 don't
 need
 these


trial
 balloons,
 I
 don't
 think.
 Right.
 I


I
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 becomes


disconcerting
 to
 the
 market,
 especially


when
 there's
 so
 many
 choices
 that
 they


are
 looking
 at.
 Look,
 personally,
 I


think
 that
 Chris
 Waller
 would
 be
 a
 great


choice.
 Not
 because
 he's
 uh


ideologically
 aligned
 with
 the


administration.
 In
 fact,
 he's
 not,
 which


is
 one
 reason
 why
 I
 think
 it
 would
 be
 a


good
 choice.
 He
 is
 dovish
 and
 I
 think


that
 aligns
 him
 temporarily
 or


short-term
 with
 the
 administration.
 But


Chris
 Waller
 has
 had
 a
 long
 history
 of


publications
 in
 which
 he
 espoused
 and


exorted
 the
 autonomy
 of
 the
 Federal


Reserve.
 So
 he
 prevent
 he
 provides
 a


very
 good
 balance
 I
 think


willing
 to
 be
 to
 be
 dovish
 right
 now


because
 he
 has
 his
 eye
 on
 the
 job
 market


and
 the
 prospected
 employment
 gains
 are


are
 diminishing
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 not


willing
 to
 be
 structurally
 dobbish.
 I


think
 that's
 what's
 needed
 right
 now
 in


in
 a
 in
 a
 Fed
 uh
 in
 a
 Fed
 uh
 chairman.


Love
 it.
 was
 taking
 notes.
 Terry,
 I'm


going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with
 Governor


Waller
 at
 the
 Council
 on
 Foreign


Relations
 October
 16th.
 Can
 you
 be
 in


the
 front
 row
 so
 I
 can
 have
 you
 ask
 a


smarter
 question?


I'd
 love
 to
 join
 you,
 Tom.
 Just
 a
 call


with
 Mccari.
 We'll
 have
 to
 see
 on
 that.


Stay
 with
 us.

Joining
 us
 tonight
 are
 Katie
 Kavitzky,


chief
 research
 strategist,
 Alpha
 Simplex


for
 an
 ample
 uh
 discussion
 here.
 The


mathematics
 is
 just
 predigious.
 All
 of


it
 based
 on
 the
 trend
 of
 the
 moment.
 The


late
 Martin
 Zwag
 over
 to
 Fed
 policy
 and


economics
 would
 say
 the
 trend
 is
 your


friend
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 right
 now


with
 the
 I
 would
 say
 weekend
 panic
 AI


we're
 all
 going
 to
 die
 capex
 we're
 all


going
 to
 die
 in
 that
 define
 the
 equity


trend
 right
 now
 Katie


the
 equity
 trend
 is
 very
 strong
 signals


have
 continued
 to
 strengthen
 especially


since
 the
 summer
 and
 there's
 really
 no


and
 what's
 challenging
 as
 a
 trend
 volume


you
 need
 to
 see
 that
 resistance
 to
 pull


pull
 back
 and
 all
 systems
 seem
 to
 be


going
 right
 now.


Well,
 Paul Paul
 allowed
 me
 to
 go
 nerd


twice
 in
 this
 interview.
 I'm
 going to
 do


that
 right
 now
 and
 then
 shut
 up
 and
 let


Paul
 drive
 it.
 Okay.
 So,
 you
 have
 a


setup
 folks
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 take
 SPX


take
 with
 NDX
 whatever
 you
 want
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 take
 out
 a
 two
 standard


deviation
 trading
 envelope
 and
 then
 I'm


going
 to
 run
 it
 logarithmic
 on
 the
 Y
 ais


to
 show
 percentage
 change,
 not
 an


arithmetic
 axis.
 And
 then
 I
 have


exponential
 moving
 averages.
 And
 I
 look


at
 the
 curve
 of
 them,
 the
 first


derivative
 and
 even
 second
 derivative.


And
 when
 you
 hear
 me
 say
 log
 convexity,


that's
 what
 we're
 talking
 about.
 The


equity
 market
 has
 not
 given
 up
 a
 bull


market
 log
 convexity,
 has
 it?


No,
 not
 at
 all.
 And
 I
 think
 depending
 on


if
 you
 use
 exponential
 moving
 averages,


I
 mean,
 that
 is
 going
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 some


of
 that
 V
 that
 you're
 seeing
 in
 the


first
 part
 of
 the
 year.
 So
 you're
 seeing


signals
 strengthening
 and
 you're
 losing


some
 of
 the
 concern.


Pro
 tip,
 Paul,
 I
 do
 this
 on
 a
 weekly


chart
 as
 a
 rule
 of
 thumb.
 Everybody
 goes


daily
 and
 I
 go
 to
 a
 week.


No
 question
 about
 that.
 Lisa's
 nodding


her
 head.
 She
 knows
 she
 goes
 log
 on
 on
 a


weekly
 basis.
 Gold
 up
 51%


spots.
 Silver
 up
 73%
 year-to-
 date.


Commodities,
 that's
 a
 trend.
 Are
 you


guys
 on
 that?


Exactly.
 I
 mean,
 that
 is
 the
 other


really
 interesting
 big
 trend.
 And
 we're


getting
 a
 lot
 of
 questions
 from


investors
 about
 it
 because
 from
 both
 a


fundamental
 perspective,
 buying
 gold,
 it


seems
 to
 be
 your
 or
 any
 precious
 metal


seems
 to
 be
 that
 go-to
 safe
 haven
 trade.


When
 the
 dollar's
 been
 weaker,
 you're


looking
 at
 the
 yen
 now
 weakening.
 So
 the


precious
 so
 it's
 buy
 gold
 and
 buy
 the


stock
 market.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 kind
 of
 an


interesting
 combo.


But
 how
 about
 the
 dollar?
 The
 the
 dollar


again,
 it
 folks,
 it
 traded
 off
 about
 8


n%
 from
 that
 early
 early
 uh
 2025
 uh


levels.
 Now
 it's
 kind
 of
 stabilized
 it


seems
 like.
 So
 is
 the
 sell-off
 over?
 Is


the
 trend
 is
 that
 selling
 trend
 kind
 of


over
 for
 the
 dollar?


That
 is
 an
 interesting
 question.
 We
 have


seen
 some
 idiosyncratic
 movements
 in
 the


dollar.
 So
 you're
 seeing
 certain


currencies
 like
 the
 Swedish
 croner,
 the


Turkish
 lera
 kind
 of
 gaining
 some
 ground


on
 the
 dollar.
 My
 view
 on
 this
 is
 it's
 a


trend
 that
 is
 sort
 of
 petering
 out.
 So


it's
 losing
 some
 of
 its
 strength.
 And


part
 of
 this
 is
 there's
 been
 so
 much
 um


so
 much
 backing
 for
 that
 weaker
 dollar,


so
 much
 hedging
 demand
 against
 the


dollar
 that
 has
 built
 up.
 Um
 we
 also


have
 rate
 cuts
 on
 the
 horizon
 which
 is


also
 very
 negative
 for
 the
 dollar.
 So


I'm
 not
 saying
 that
 I'm
 positive
 on
 the


dollar
 yet
 because
 of
 that.
 But
 it
 is
 a


trend
 that
 as
 as
 Tom
 would
 say
 losing


some
 of
 its
 convexity,


losing
 steam,
 I
 would
 put
 it,
 but


convexity.


I
 think
 he's
 lost
 convexity.
 That's


right.
 Exactly.
 Um,
 so
 what's
 the
 what


are
 the
 trades
 you
 guys
 are
 looking
 at


these
 days?


So
 the
 biggest
 trades
 that
 you're
 seeing


in
 the
 market
 is
 clearly
 equities
 and


precious
 metals,
 but
 interestingly


enough,
 you
 haven't
 seen
 a
 lot
 of


movement
 at
 fixed
 income.
 It's
 been


long
 to
 short
 and
 it
 feels
 like
 that's


an
 area
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 some
 change


in
 the
 next
 few
 months,
 but
 the
 signals


are
 really
 weak.


Do
 you
 guys
 short
 in
 the
 market?


Uh,
 right
 now
 we're
 not
 short
 in
 the
 US.


We're
 seeing
 short
 positions
 in
 Europe.


So
 you're
 seeing
 things
 like
 JGBs
 also


and
 and
 you
 know
 the
 UK.
 Um
 but
 the
 US


has
 remained
 long.


To
 be
 clear
 on
 your
 short
 JGB,
 your


short
 price.


Yes.


Price
 down,
 yield
 up.


Correct.


More
 worse.
 Worer
 as
 they
 say.

 Paul.
 So,
 government
 shutdown.


Do
 people
 like
 you,
 do
 you
 care
 about


that?


I
 mean,
 I
 obviously
 care
 about
 it


because
 I
 got
 to
 fly
 home
 today.
 You


know what
 I
 mean?
 But,
 um,
 Exactly.
 You


know,
 but
 what's
 really
 interesting
 is


the
 markets
 are
 seeing
 through.
 They


are.
 It
 is.


And
 they're
 focused
 on
 growth
 and


they're
 focused
 on
 let's
 not
 miss
 out
 on


this
 AI
 bubble
 or
 potential
 rally,


whichever
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it.
 So,
 it's


not
 moving
 on
 that.


Okay.
 Okay,
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 now,


folks,
 it's
 my
 second
 dose
 of
 nerd


Friday
 nerd
 show.
 We
 welcome
 all
 of
 you.


What
 a
 privilege
 years
 ago
 to
 interview


at
 length
 Ed
 Thorp,
 who
 invented
 so
 much


of
 this.
 He
 basically
 folks
 took
 Las


Vegas
 into
 the
 classroom,
 which
 was
 at


the
 time
 scandalous,


and
 brought
 Las
 Vegas,
 how
 do
 I
 not
 lose


money,
 over
 to
 the
 stock
 market,
 how
 do


I
 not
 lose
 money?
 Katie
 Kaminsky,
 my


religion
 is
 anti
 martingale
 theory,


folks.
 The
 stock,
 you
 buy
 it
 at
 100,
 it


goes
 to
 90.
 I
 think
 I'll
 double
 up.


That's
 what
 most
 people
 do.
 Ed
 Thorp


saying
 buy
 it
 at
 a
 100
 and
 only
 add
 to


the
 portfolio


if
 it
 goes
 up.
 Anti
 martingaleill


policy
 out
 of
 COVID
 and
 forward.
 How
 has


it
 been
 working?
 So
 it's
 it's
 had
 its


moments
 and
 I
 think
 what's
 really


exciting
 about
 that
 is
 he
 talks
 a
 lot


Edor
 talked
 a
 lot
 about
 Kelly
 betting


and
 this
 is
 the
 idea
 that
 your


conviction
 is
 a
 function
 of
 the
 strength


of
 the
 trend
 of
 your
 position
 and
 it


works
 very
 well
 in
 poker
 and
 and
 in


other
 areas
 as
 well.
 And
 for
 people
 who


are
 not
 familiar
 with
 Kelly
 betting
 it's


about
 this
 idea
 that
 you
 measure
 the


strength
 of
 the
 probability
 of
 your
 bet


and
 when
 your
 bet
 strength
 is
 stronger


then
 you
 take
 more
 risk.
 And
 that's
 sort


of
 what
 trend
 following
 is
 really
 trying


to
 do
 is
 trying
 to
 adjust
 positions
 as
 a


function
 of
 the
 conviction
 of
 the


markets
 and
 how
 they
 move.
 And
 it
 works


very
 well
 in
 a
 world
 where
 the
 headline


risks
 don't
 run
 the
 show.
 So
 the
 fact


that
 government
 shutdown
 is
 not
 causing


noise,
 you're
 seeing
 those
 trends
 being


quite
 profitable
 for
 trend
 falling
 in


the
 last
 two
 to
 three
 months
 because


that
 consistent
 approach
 of
 measuring


and
 adjusting
 is
 is
 working
 pretty
 well.


One
 of
 those
 trends
 slash
 potentially


bubble
 risk
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 is
 just


this
 whole
 AI
 narrative
 in
 the
 market.


And
 it
 got
 maybe
 to
 a
 fever
 pitch
 over


the
 last
 week
 to
 two
 weeks
 when
 we
 saw


investments
 by
 these
 big
 tech
 companies


like
 Nvidia
 into
 these
 private


companies,
 platforms
 like
 Open
 AI
 and


then
 they
 would
 then
 commit
 to
 buy
 chips


and
 this
 circular
 trade.
 people
 said,


"Boy,
 this
 this
 doesn't
 feel
 right
 or
 it


feels
 a
 little
 fishy,
 but


boats
 are
 rising
 on
 this
 trade."
 How
 do


you
 guys
 think
 about
 that?


So,
 the
 way
 we
 think
 about
 bubbles
 as
 a


trend
 follower
 is
 it's
 really
 about


measuring
 and
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 pick


tops
 and
 bottoms
 of
 any
 sort
 of
 trend.


And
 so,
 what
 you
 want
 to
 think
 about
 is


a
 trend
 can
 actually
 go
 much
 longer
 than


you
 would
 expect.
 And
 that's
 this
 idea


that
 Tom
 was
 talking
 about
 about
 the


Kelly
 vetting.
 So
 you
 continue
 to
 trade


into
 it
 and
 sometimes
 it
 could
 take


months.
 I
 mean
 just
 because
 we
 are


worried
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 the
 market


will
 react
 and
 so
 we
 wait
 till
 the


market
 reacts
 to
 confirm
 that
 hey
 this


is
 actually
 you
 know
 something
 that's


going
 against
 us.


What's
 the
 biggest
 let
 me
 make
 this


personal.
 What's
 the
 biggest
 mistake


Lisa
 Mateo's
 kids
 make
 sitting
 on
 the


couch
 trading
 through
 Robin
 Hood?
 I
 want


you
 to
 speak
 to
 our
 audience
 and


particularly
 our
 audience
 with
 kids
 that


are
 learning.
 They
 don't
 have
 your


mathiness.
 They
 they
 don't
 know
 who


Andrew
 Low
 is.
 Okay.
 What's
 the
 biggest


mistake
 the
 trading
 crew
 is
 making


today?


I
 think
 and
 this
 is
 a
 personal
 view.


Emotions
 and
 moving
 on
 your
 emotions.


That's
 why
 we
 have
 a
 diligent
 process
 is


where
 you
 make
 the
 biggest
 mistakes.
 And


actually
 some
 of
 the
 research
 that


Andrew
 Low
 did
 looking
 at
 investor


behavior,
 they
 find
 that
 it's
 precisely


those
 panic
 cells,
 those
 sort
 of


emotions
 where
 you
 kind
 of
 say,
 you


know,
 things
 go
 down
 and
 panic
 that


actually
 cost
 you
 the
 most.
 So
 I
 think


this
 idea
 that
 your
 emotions
 connected


to
 what
 you
 decide
 is
 actually
 the


dangerous
 part
 about


a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 math
 a
 lot
 of
 the


research
 shows
 returns
 are
 are
 generated


over
 a
 longer
 period
 of
 time
 and
 a


relatively
 few
 discreet
 time
 periods.
 So


you
 it
 goes
 to
 Tom's
 point
 you
 need
 to


be
 in
 the
 market.
 If
 you
 try
 to
 time
 the


market
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 just
 seems


like
 a
 way
 tough
 game.
 It's
 just
 you


kind
 of
 have
 to
 just
 be
 in
 the
 market,


you
 know,
 otherwise
 you're
 just
 going
 to


miss
 it,
 I
 think.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 who
 knows?
 I
 mean,
 look
 at


the
 equity
 markets
 now.
 It
 could
 be


months.


Jim
 Kramer
 and
 I
 have
 talked
 about
 this.


Jim's
 been
 very
 good
 about
 it
 in


speeches
 and
 that
 there's
 a
 huge


baseball
 analog
 here
 and
 that
 if
 you


line
 up,
 you
 know,
 to
 keep
 it


conversational,
 10
 trades,
 all
 of
 your


alpha
 comes
 out
 of
 two
 or
 three
 winners.


Let's
 expand
 that
 out
 to
 a
 lifetime
 of


trading.
 You
 got
 a
 retirement
 plan,


folks.
 you're
 wicked
 conservative
 and


you're
 playing
 a
 speculative
 portfolio.


If
 you
 do
 a
 hundred
 events,


how
 many
 of
 those
 really
 create
 alpha?


I'm
 going
 to
 say
 18
 out
 of
 a
 100red.


So,
 it
 depends.
 For
 trend
 volumeing,


it's
 much
 more
 of
 like
 a
 50/50
 ratio


where
 your
 hits
 and
 the
 hit
 rate
 and
 the


win
 is
 higher
 on
 that
 50/50.
 So,
 that


actually
 shows
 you
 that
 trading
 in
 the


markets,
 it's
 very
 difficult
 and
 the


edge
 is
 small.
 And
 so
 it's
 the
 diligence


that
 actually
 matters
 as
 opposed
 to
 kind


of
 picking
 that
 specific
 winner.


You
 can't
 pick
 the
 winner.
 You
 can
 pick


a
 set
 of
 winners,
 but
 I
 I
 think
 the


industry
 is
 weaned
 that
 everything
 can


be
 a
 winner.
 You
 can
 win
 60
 Paul
 60%.


70.
 This
 is
 there's
 no
 evidence
 of
 that


within
 the
 at
 Vanderbilt
 has
 led
 on


this.
 That's
 why
 Damian's
 nuts
 like
 he


is.
 They
 did
 great
 research
 at


Vanderbilt,
 but
 I
 I
 mean
 you
 you
 just


don't
 have
 that.
 It's
 not
 Munger's


brilliant
 on
 this.
 The
 late
 Charles


Munger
 absolutely
 brilliant
 on
 this.


Katie,
 how
 do
 you
 guys
 decide
 to
 sell
 a


winner?


Great.


The
 way
 that
 we
 think
 about


philosophical.


So
 the
 way
 to
 think
 about
 winners
 is


when
 l
 winners
 are
 becoming
 losers.
 You


know what
 I
 mean?
 So
 we're
 always


thinking
 about
 the
 sizing.
 So,
 for


example,
 if
 you
 see
 a
 pullback,
 so
 if


you
 see
 something
 like
 what
 happened
 in


gold,


it
 creates
 some
 noise
 on
 your
 signal.


So,
 that's
 an
 indication
 that
 you're


kind
 of
 hitting
 some
 of
 the
 top
 and
 that


you're
 kind
 of
 seeing
 that
 resistance


because
 if
 something
 pulls
 back
 10
 10%,


do
 you
 sell
 half
 your
 position?
 If
 it


pulls
 back
 another
 10%,
 you
 sell
 it
 all.


It
 depends
 on
 the
 time
 horizon.
 I
 mean,


I
 think
 where
 it
 gets
 tricky
 is
 in
 these


big
 huge
 sell-off
 moments
 where
 it's


very
 hard
 to
 ascertain,
 you
 know,
 is


this
 an
 environment
 where
 the
 trend
 is


actually
 changed
 or
 is
 there
 noise
 and


so
 we
 tend
 to
 use
 multiple
 different


horizons
 and
 measurements
 to
 kind
 of


aggregate
 to
 have
 a
 view
 that's
 maybe


more
 of
 a
 voting
 mechanism.
 So
 as
 a


traditional
 rule,
 I
 mean
 I
 mean


everybody
 used
 to
 have
 300
 stock


portfolios
 and
 then
 they
 became
 a


hundred
 and
 then
 Merceno
 and
 the
 crew


over
 at
 Fidelity
 invented
 Fidelity
 50.


Sequoia
 had
 a
 lot
 to
 do
 with
 that.


What's
 the
 optimal
 stock
 portfolio
 for


mere
 mortals
 listening
 here?


So
 I'd
 say
 I
 mean
 for
 stocks
 they're


pretty
 highly
 correlated.
 So
 you
 want
 a


relatively
 diverse
 portfolio.
 We
 tend
 to


trade
 multi-asset.
 So
 that
 actually


gives
 you
 a
 lot
 more
 diversification


because
 you
 can
 add
 gold
 to
 your
 to
 your


equity
 positions.


Did
 you
 add
 gold
 to
 your
 positions?


Yes,
 we've
 been
 in
 gold.
 Yeah,
 it's
 been


the
 right
 call
 and
 it's
 been
 like
 that


for
 about
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 now.
 So
 gold


is
 an
 example
 of
 a
 perfect
 trend.
 I


can't
 tell
 you
 why,
 but


it's
 doing
 it.


One
 more
 question
 here
 to
 Paul's
 great


question
 on
 AI.
 What
 do
 you
 do
 with
 a


Mag
 7
 here
 into
 earnings
 season?


Well,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 tricky
 because
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 mag
 7,
 it's
 such
 a
 large


proportion
 and
 that's
 what
 makes
 me
 and


most
 people
 nervous
 is
 you
 have
 such
 a


concentrated
 exposure
 to
 them.
 But
 most


reports
 are
 showing
 that
 earnings
 are


still
 looking
 good.
 So,
 like
 I
 said


before,


while
 the
 train's
 still
 going,


it
 could
 go
 for
 a
 while
 before
 we
 have


any
 sort
 of
 disruption.

 you

 You
 got
 to
 be
 a

 to
 get


on

You
 do.
 Well,
 Yuri
 Timmer's
 a
 player.


Let's
 dovetail
 the
 two
 together.
 Ren


Holtz
 urine
 timmer
 has
 a
 phenomenal
 type


two
 construct
 how
 not
 to
 invest
 when
 you


look
 at
 all
 your
 abilities
 at
 fidelities


what
 should
 you
 not
 do
 now


well
 good
 morning
 um
 you
 know
 as
 your


very
 great
 uh
 previous
 guest
 mentioned


you
 know
 having
 a
 having
 a
 system
 um
 is


very
 important
 and
 you
 know
 the
 market


goes
 up
 10
 11%
 per
 year
 it
 rises
 is
 60


70%
 of
 the
 time.
 Uh
 but
 it
 has
 it's


volatile
 and
 30
 to
 40%
 of
 the
 time
 the


market
 drops
 and
 nobody
 likes
 that


unless
 you're
 a
 short
 seller.
 And
 so


having
 a
 plan
 for
 those
 times
 is
 really


what
 separates
 the
 the
 investors
 who


compound
 from
 the
 ones
 who
 don't.
 So
 I
 I


like
 to
 think
 of
 it
 as
 the
 price
 of


admission
 for
 that
 juicy
 return,
 right?


is
 to
 not
 lose
 your
 stuff
 when
 the


market
 doesn't
 go
 the
 way
 you
 want
 it.


And
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 really
 the
 most


important
 thing
 uh
 in
 investing
 for
 all


of
 you
 worldwide.
 This
 is
 the
 way
 we


roll

 year
 and
 you
 sit
 back
 there
 at


Fidelity
 as
 director
 of
 global
 macro


from
 a
 global
 perspective.
 What
 looks


attractive
 to
 you
 these
 days?


Um
 what
 really
 gets
 me
 um
 excited
 these


days
 is
 the
 how
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world.


So
 we
 know
 you
 know
 the
 US
 has
 been


exceptional.
 The
 Mag
 7
 have
 dominated


really
 for
 the
 last
 you
 know
 decade.
 It


was
 the
 fangs
 before
 the
 mag
 7.
 And
 so


we
 know
 about
 this,
 you
 know,
 supremacy


premium
 that
 US
 assets
 have
 always


enjoyed
 uh
 and
 they
 still
 obviously


continue
 to
 enjoy.
 And
 we've
 got
 the
 AI


story
 overlaying
 that.
 And
 for
 many
 many


years,
 you
 know,
 valueoriented
 investors


would
 say,
 well,
 look
 at
 look
 at
 EHA
 or


EM
 or
 just,
 you
 know,
 MSEIXUS
 index.


It's
 trading
 at,
 you
 know,
 a
 PE
 that
 is


so
 much
 lower
 than
 the
 US.
 why
 don't
 we


do
 the
 whole
 mean
 reversion
 trade
 and
 go


there
 and
 sell
 the
 expensive
 US
 and
 you


know
 that
 doesn't
 really
 work
 until
 you


have
 an
 actual
 catalyst
 that
 drives


value
 um
 into
 the
 shareholders
 pocket


and
 so
 for
 many
 years
 we
 did
 not
 have


that
 but
 in
 the
 last
 year
 or
 two
 or


really
 last
 year
 or
 so
 that's
 finally


happening
 so
 especially
 for
 the
 Msei
 EA


which
 is
 the
 non-
 US
 developed
 markets


index
 um
 they
 have
 companies
 there
 So


mostly
 Europe
 and
 Japan
 have
 really


started
 to
 unlock
 shareholder
 value.
 You


know
 even
 like
 regional
 banks
 in
 Japan


are
 now
 buying
 back
 shares.
 Uh
 and
 that


might
 sound
 trivial
 but
 when
 you
 look
 at


a
 discounted
 cash
 flow
 model
 you


obviously
 look
 at
 long-term
 earnings


projections
 but
 almost
 as
 importantly


you
 look
 at
 the
 share
 of
 those
 earnings


that
 get
 returned
 back
 to
 shareholders


in
 the
 form
 of
 dividends
 and
 buybacks.


And
 so
 the
 growth
 rate
 of
 the
 PO
 of
 the


payout
 and
 the
 payout
 ratio
 so
 the


percentage
 of
 earnings
 that
 are
 returned


um
 is
 very
 important
 and
 for
 EHA
 over


the
 last
 5
 years
 the
 PO
 has
 actually


grown
 faster
 than
 in
 the
 US
 um
 and
 the


payout
 ratio
 which
 always
 used
 to
 be


lower
 in
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 is
 now
 at


75%
 for
 EPHA
 and
 it's
 at
 75%
 for
 the
 US


only
 the
 composition
 is
 different
 for


non-
 US
 markets
 it's
 2/3
 dividends
 one/3


buyback
 and
 in
 the
 US
 it's
 the
 opposite


but
 you
 have
 now
 very
 competitive
 um


fundamentals
 and
 you
 know
 non
 US
 stocks


are
 trading
 at
 1516
 the
 US
 is
 trading
 at


25
 so
 finally


for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 a
 very
 long
 time


uh
 we're
 now
 in
 a
 global
 bull
 market


where
 uh
 the
 pond
 has
 gotten
 bigger


which
 is
 good
 right
 because
 we
 all
 have


to
 deal
 with
 concentration
 risk
 of
 the


max


Y


but
 there
 are
 other
 places
 to
 go
 which


which
 is
 good
 for
 for
 an
 investor.


You're
 in
 uh
 earnings
 start
 in
 earnest


next
 week
 with
 the
 banks.
 I
 know
 your


teams
 at
 Fidelity,
 all
 the
 analysts,
 the


army
 you've
 got
 there
 will
 be
 pouring


over
 the
 earnings
 uh
 releases.
 What
 are


you
 looking
 for
 for
 this
 earning
 season?


Well,
 what
 we
 had
 in
 the
 last
 couple
 of


quarters
 was
 um
 earnings
 beats
 that
 were


well
 north
 of
 what
 we
 typically
 see.
 So


we
 all
 know
 this
 is
 the
 oldest
 game
 on


the
 world,
 right?
 Companies
 guide
 lower


and
 then
 they
 underpromise
 and
 overd


deliver
 and
 then
 during
 earning
 season,


you
 know,
 they
 beat
 by
 3
 400
 basis


points
 and
 that's
 fairly
 typical.
 Um


earlier
 this
 year,
 of
 course,
 we
 had
 the


tariff
 tantr,
 earnings
 revisions
 were


were
 being
 cut
 down
 and
 then
 they
 were


sort
 of,
 you
 know,
 brought
 back
 up
 again


when
 when
 the
 when
 the
 worst
 case
 tariff


situation
 did
 not
 develop
 and
 then
 we


had
 the
 one
 big
 beautiful
 bill.
 Um
 and


so
 right
 now
 the
 earnings
 growth
 rate,


the
 expected
 growth
 rate
 for
 Q3
 is
 at


7%.
 And
 if
 recent
 history
 is
 any
 guide,


we'll
 go
 well
 into
 the
 double
 digits.


And
 that
 will
 then
 be
 three
 quarters
 in


a
 row
 of
 double
 digit
 earnings
 growth.


And
 what
 what
 more
 do
 you
 want,
 right?


In
 in
 a
 market
 that
 is
 expensive
 and
 now


about
 to
 enter
 its
 fourth
 fourth
 year
 of


the
 second.


I
 got
 I
 got
 90
 seconds.
 And
 this
 single


sentence
 in
 your
 report
 is
 too


important.


You
 cannot
 see
 a
 bubble
 coming.
 You
 can


only
 discuss
 a
 bubble
 after
 the
 fact.


Give
 me
 one
 attribute
 that
 gets
 you
 out


front
 of
 a
 quote
 unquote
 bubble.


Um,
 they
 always
 last
 longer
 than
 people


think.
 I
 I've
 I've
 done
 the
 analoges
 all


the
 way
 back
 to
 the
 tulip
 mania
 and
 um


they
 are
 by
 definition
 they
 are
 chaotic


patterns.
 They're
 parabas
 and
 those
 are


not
 rational
 linear
 patterns.
 So,
 this


is
 why
 bubbles
 suck
 everybody
 in
 because


otherwise
 there
 would
 not
 be
 a
 bubble,


right?
 I
 can't
 say
 enough
 about
 that,


folks.
 You're
 in
 timar
 on
 the
 x-axis.


Everything
 takes
 longer
 and
 if
 you're


betting
 against
 it
 big
 time
 in,
 out
 in,


out,
 as
 Mr.
 Maynard
 Kane
 said,
 guess


what
 Paul,
 you
 run
 out
 of
 money.
 You're


in
 timmer.

 you
 so
 much

Now,
 back
 to
 regular
 newspapers.
 The
 reg


I'm
 afraid
 to
 ask,
 what
 do
 you
 got?


Okay,
 we
 touched
 upon
 this
 yesterday


with
 um
 PepsiCo
 earnings,
 but
 the
 Wall


Street
 Journal
 has
 this
 deeper
 look
 into


the
 makeover
 of
 Lays
 potato
 chips.
 Okay,


cuz
 health
 conscious
 consumers,
 you
 did


look.
 Okay,
 let's
 start
 with
 the
 bag.


Okay,
 for
 those
 of
 you,


this
 is
 it.
 Okay,
 if
 you're
 watching
 on


YouTube,
 this
 is
 what
 the
 bag
 looked


like
 before.
 So,
 they're
 going
 to
 be


changing
 it.
 You
 have
 this
 shiny
 yellow


bag,
 right,
 with
 a
 little
 potato
 on
 the


bottom.
 Okay.
 So,
 what
 it's
 going
 to
 be,


it's
 going
 to
 have
 a
 phrase
 that
 says


made
 with
 real
 potatoes.


No
 more
 shiny
 as
 opposed
 to
 the


ingredients
 on
 the
 back.
 I'm
 not
 sure.


Um
 but
 um
 the
 shiny
 bags
 are
 going
 to


have
 this
 matte
 finish.
 It's
 going to


have
 pictures
 of
 potatoes
 and
 chips
 and


more
 kind
 of
 natural
 look
 to
 it.
 Okay.


And
 it's
 going to
 have
 wordings
 that
 say


no
 artificial
 colors,
 no
 artificial


dyes,
 flavors.
 It's
 going
 to
 have
 that


on
 the
 front.
 And
 on
 the
 back,
 it's


gonna
 have
 the
 original
 chip
 recipe
 from


Herman
 Lay
 himself.
 Nice.


Um,
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 ingredient
 changes.
 It's


all
 because
 of
 what's
 going
 on,
 you


know,
 today.


It's
 through
 the
 whole
 food
 industry,


right?


It's
 through
 the
 whole
 food
 industry.
 We


always
 hear
 about
 different
 companies


kind
 of
 taking
 out
 these
 dyes.


Can
 I
 ask
 a
 dumb
 question,


please?


Is
 French's
 mustard
 really
 yellow?
 Is


Hines
 ketchup
 really
 red?
 I'm
 sure
 it's


not
 as
 red
 as
 that.
 But
 that's
 the


problem
 is
 that
 these
 colors
 like
 the


the
 the
 the
 barbecue
 potato
 chips,


they're
 this
 red
 color,
 but
 it's
 because


of,
 you
 know,
 the
 artificial
 coloring.


Can
 I
 ask
 you a
 dumb
 question?
 We
 got
 to


get
 to
 the
 next
 story.
 Who
 cares
 what


the
 color
 is
 if
 the
 bag
 of
 chips
 has
 a


pound
 of
 salt
 in
 it?


Right.
 Exactly.
 That's
 what
 we're


talking
 about.


Are
 we
 like
 missing
 what
 we're
 really


talking
 about?
 How
 many
 bags
 did
 you


have
 this
 morning?


I
 had
 a
 bag
 this
 morning.
 I
 had
 that


like
 a
 bag
 like
 that


and
 I'm
 just
 fine.


40
 milligrams
 of
 sodium.


Can
 I
 Can
 I
 I'm
 sure
 that
 Mr.


Bloomberg's
 listening.
 His
 P&L
 has


gotten
 shaken.
 Every
 day
 when
 I
 walk
 out


of
 here,
 I
 sneak
 out
 a
 bag
 of
 cheese.


You
 know,
 it
 doesn't,
 you
 know,


just
 because
 it
 hurts
 to
 be
 blueberry


LP,
 you
 know.
 What
 do
 you
 got
 next?


Okay.
 What
 else
 we
 have
 in
 the
 blueberry


pantry?
 That
 would
 be
 matcha.
 Yes.
 Okay.


So,
 I
 have
 my
 matcha
 here.


That's


it's
 a
 look
 into
 matcha
 mania.
 But
 this


is
 serious.
 This
 is
 Financial
 Times.


They're
 saying,
 "Can
 Japan
 sustain
 the


demand?"
 Because
 the
 demand
 has
 gotten


so
 great,
 not
 just
 for
 like
 matcha


lattes,
 but
 for
 things
 like
 matcha


flavored
 KitKats,
 matcha
 flavored


cookies,
 matcha
 flavored,
 you
 know,
 ice


cream,
 all
 this.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 a
 staple.


Is
 a
 matcha
 a
 leaf?


It's
 Yes.
 It's
 the
 from
 the
 green
 tea


leaves.
 It's
 a
 powder
 made
 from
 it.


Okay.
 Okay.


So,
 it's
 green
 tea
 leaves.


Green
 tea
 leaves.
 Yes.
 It's
 crushed
 into


a
 powder
 and
 the
 powder
 is
 what
 you
 use


in
 the
 matcha.


But
 you
 have
 to
 put
 something
 in
 the


matcha
 to
 make
 it
 even
 drinkable.


I
 actually
 and
 I
 put
 um
 a
 little
 syrup


in
 here.


All
 right.


But
 it's
 it's
 becoming
 this
 this
 big


thing.
 I
 mean,
 Japan's
 exports
 of


powdered
 green
 teas
 were
 up
 75%
 in
 2024.


So,
 it
 goes
 to
 show
 you
 how
 much
 this
 is


on
 the
 rise.
 Um
 it
 can
 become
 a
 problem.


Chill
 and
 never
 squeeze
 in
 one
 more
 and


make
 it
 something
 I'm
 pleased
 with.
 Yes.


Okay.
 This
 one
 also.
 Well,
 there
 was
 a


lot
 of
 talk,
 right,
 over
 whether


trimming
 down
 the
 New
 York
 City
 mayoral


race
 would
 trim
 Zor
 Mandami's
 lead.
 And


there's
 a
 new
 Quinnipic
 poll
 that
 shows


it's
 starting
 to
 happen.
 Mandami's
 lead


over
 former
 Governor
 Andrew
 Cuomo.
 It's


narrowed
 after
 Mayor
 Eric
 Adams
 exited.


So,
 here's
 what
 they
 show
 in
 their


latest
 poll.
 He
 leads
 a
 race
 46%
 um


backed
 him
 followed
 by
 Cuomo
 with
 33%.


Um
 Curtis
 Lee
 15%.
 Now,
 when
 you
 look


before
 um
 when
 it
 was
 a
 four-way
 race,


it
 showed
 that
 Mandami
 had
 45%
 to


support,
 23%
 for
 Cuomo,
 15%
 for
 Sleep.


So,
 it's
 looking
 like,
 you
 know,
 nearly


all
 of
 Adam's
 supporters
 are
 turning
 to


Cuomo
 at
 this
 point.


To
 the
 mayoral
 staffs
 listening
 on


Bloomberg
 1130,
 we
 are
 honored
 to
 have


your
 candidates
 come
 in

 talk

 get


all
 the
 rest
 of
 them,
 frankly,
 numerous


times
 before
 the
 first
 two.


Yeah.
 Mr.
 Almost
 we
 have
 not.
 I
 guess
 we


had
 Mr.
 Matani
 once
 I
 believe.
 So


pretty
 good.
