(soft whimsical music)
- [Derek] There is a limestone
cave in Western Virginia
where one of its giant chambers
has been turned into a musical instrument.
They call it an organ,
but it's like no other
organ on the planet.
- Oh!
- [Derek] It relies on
electromechanical mallets,
steel bolts, electric guitar pickups,
and the main vibrating
material, limestone.
It's more technically
referred to as a lithophone,
the only one of its kind in the world,
but people around here
just call it the organ.
So Veritasium producer
Petr went to check it out.
- We're going underground. Let's go.
Can you tell me a little bit
about the history of this place?
- Luray Caverns?
- Yeah.
- Discovered 1878, and, in fact,
to your right is where they first came in.
- Oh, no way.
- On August 13th, 1878,
a group of hunters felt
a cool breeze coming
from a small hole in the ground.
Putting down their
rifles, they began to dig,
making a hole big enough for the smallest
of them to fit through.
Andrew and Quint had
only a candle for light
as they lowered themselves
down into the hole.
They spent the next few months exploring.
They kept finding giant caverns connected
by narrow passageways.
The ceilings and floors were covered
in stalactites and stalagmites.
They even found an underground lake.
The cave system they had
accidentally stumbled upon
turned out to be the largest
in the Eastern United States,
covering 26 hectares.
It's now known as the Luray Caverns,
and it's visited by half a
million tourists each year.
- [Larry] That's Dream Lake.
- [Petr] How still that water is
and the reflection is just
really something else.
- The organ is one of the lower areas.
It's in a room called the
Cathedral, a very large room.
- [Petr] Yeah, that makes sense.
- [Larry] And they used to
have dances down there, balls.
They used to call it the ballroom
before the organ was put in.
- Oh, no way.
So in the 1920s, people
would go down here and have
- Oh yeah.
- balls and dances and
- Well, it was no-
- shindigs.
- [Larry] It was a great place
because it's air conditioned
basically naturally, so.
- Yeah, that makes sense.
Oh my God. Are you kidding me?
No way. Oh, this is so gorgeous.
(riveting instrumental music)
And there's the control
panel for the organ.
- That's the organ.
You're actually inside
the organ right now.
The organ covers three and a half acres.
All the notes are scattered out around us.
Of course, this was started
in 1954, first played in 1957.
- Okay. So it took
three years to get from-
- Yes.
- Welcome to the
beautiful caverns of Luray
in Luray, Virginia and particularly
to the Great Stalacpipe Organ,
which is located in this great
cathedral-like structure,
which is 260 feet below the surface.
This organ is so huge that
you stand not before it
but within it.
- [Derek] In 1954 while on a tour
of the caverns for his son's
birthday, Leland Sprinkle,
a mathematician who worked
at the Pentagon, had an idea.
See, during the tour,
the guide walked around
with a small mallet.
He would occasionally hit a stalactite,
producing a musical tone.
This was the start of
Sprinkle's three-year project
to turn the cave into
a musical instrument.
- Since you asked for it, we
shall be most happy to show you
how we make music from the
ancient stalactites around us.
- What he did is he walked
around these caverns
with a ladder and climbing
equipment and little mallets
and little tuning forks, and
he would hit on stalactites.
And then when there was
one that was close enough
to concert pitch that he wanted,
he'd take a disc grinder
and grind off the stalactite
until it came to the pitch that he wanted.
So this one should be middle C.
(soft jaunty music)
(sound chimes)
- Stalactites form very slowly.
In this cave,
they grow at around 16 cubic
centimeters every 120 years.
The rate is dependent on the
amount of water that flows.
So some stalactites grow quickly
while others don't really grow at all.
They form as slightly acidic
water flows through the ground.
It dissolves the limestone
and then redeposits it
when it comes in contact with the air.
As the water drips to the ground,
it can also deposit the
limestone on the floor,
leading to a stalagmite.
Sometimes over thousands
of years, the stalactite
and stalagmite can fuse
together, forming a column.
You don't need to be living
in an underground cave
to know that cybersecurity is important.
One of the things you can do
to keep your identity safe
is to use a virtual private
network like our sponsor,
NordVPN.
It hides your IP address,
and one thing I love about NordVPN
is how fast their speeds are,
which is especially useful when connecting
to streaming services in faraway locations
to watch content that's only
available in those regions.
I've been traveling around a lot recently,
but hockey season has started.
So I've been using NordVPN
to watch NHL Games while
I'm here in Australia.
Go Canucks.
I just connect to the
NordVPN servers in the US,
and then I can see everything I want.

I wanna thank NordVPN for
sponsoring this part of the video,
and now back to the cave.
(soft chiming music)
If you tap on a stalactite,
then like a tuning fork,
it vibrates at its resonant frequency.
That frequency depends on the size
and shape of the stalactite.
Bigger stalactites make lower notes,
and it also depends on the
elastic modulus of the material.
In this case, it's all limestone.
So to adjust the resonant frequencies,
Sprinkle shaved a bit off
the end of some stalactites,
putting them into concert pitch.
The organ wasn't connected to
the console when we visited,
so Petr didn't get a chance to play it.
But Rob Scallon, who has
a great YouTube channel,
made a video about it a couple years ago.
We asked him what it's
like to play a cave.
- It's hard to describe the
feeling of playing a cave.
(keys echo)
It's very like grounding,
very surreal, very beautiful.
You know, if I'm being romantic about it,
you can hear the eons
and eons and eons of time
that were needed to create this thing.
The cave is, of course, huge,
and all the notes are in different places.
So some are further away. Some are closer.
Some are amplified near you,
some aren't, and I love reverb,
and the amount of reverb in
this room is just so immense,
and the notes are so pure and beautiful,
and they're in different places.
So they like have different reverb.
It's a very like hauntingly
beautiful type of sound.
- As you can see,
there's also the solenoid
that is basically a mallet.
- [Leland] After the
tuning has been completed,
we design a custom built bracket
to which we attach an
electrically operated plunger.
This plunger with its rubber
tip strikes the stalactite,
causing it to vibrate.
- [Derek] Since different
musical stalactites
are far away from each other
and their volume variable,
Sprinkle amplified the vibrations.
He could've used microphones,
but in the 1950s,
those weren't particularly robust.
So instead, he borrowed
an idea from a piece
of technology invented in the 1930s,
the electric guitar pickup.
(upbeat electric guitar music)
A guitar pickup is a coil of
wire wrapped around a magnet.
When a steel guitar
string vibrates near it,
it interacts with the magnetic field,
which induces a current in the wire.
It doesn't work with
non-metal guitar strings.
The thing that's vibrating
needs to be ferromagnetic.
Sprinkle added a steel bolt to each
of his musical stalactites
and then used a pickup
to detect the vibrations.
These signals are amplified mixed
and played back through speakers.
- You also gotta consider the weight
of the bolt that goes into.
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.
- [Derek] But the guitar pickups
created an unexpected
problem, radio interference.
- I don't know exactly how it works,
but one of the keys was picking
up a local radio station,
which actually turned it into a sampler.
It was a really fun part of the video
and actually sounded pretty cool.
That happens with electronic
instruments sometimes,
even caves. (laughs)
(keys echo)
(muffled singing echoes)
What is that? It happens
every time I hit that key.
(keys echo)
(muffled singing echoes)
I'm like turning on the radio.
- [Man] It is picking up on that signal.
(people laugh)
- Oh my God.
- That is what it is.
You're getting keys.
- So the radio is here.
(voices echoes)
I thought, I'm like,
"Is that a human voice?"
Like is that-
- That would be the AM radio.
AM station across the street.
- [Petr] If they were
tuned in, you know, 1957,
have they become longer
and hence gone out of tune?
- Well, he tried to pick
stalactites that are inactive,
that aren't growing anymore
is what he tried to do.
- [Petr] But if he found
stalactites that were growing
'cause I'm seeing like a
little bit of water, right?
- Yeah, and you'll see-
- There's a little bit
of growth happening.
- Right,
and you'll see that,
and that comes and goes,
but we've never had to retune one yet.
- Like I love the idea
that there's an organ
that could grow out of tune
- It could.
- because of how stalactites grow.
- I don't think it'll be in
my lifetime, but it could.
(Larry chuckles)
- If he chose a bunch
that weren't inactive,
it would be out of tune already.
- [Larry] Oh yeah.
If they were completely
active, it would be.
- That's so cool.
- It's very mad scientist.
He definitely couldn't
get away with it now,
like going into a place like this
and then just starting to
shave off the stalactites
that took eons to be created by nature.
Thankfully it stays in tune
'cause I can't continue shaving
off the parts of this cave.
- This is just such a
strange and beautiful
and kind of insane project
to take this gorgeous cavern
and make it even more beautiful
by turning into a musical instrument.
- This structure has been
being created drop by drop
for an unfathomable amount of years,
and that's pretty awe inspiring.
