All right.
We are about 2 minutes away from the end
of the trading day.
Katie Greifeld and Matt Miller, he's in
for Romaine Bostick.
Here to help take us through the closing
bell, we're joined by a global
simulcast, Carol Massar and Isobel lead
in for Tim Stenovec.
We bring together all of our different
audiences, Carol, and we were just
talking about how we were so close to
seeing of another green finish for the
S&P 500, but those trade tensions coming
back in a big way just in the last 15
minutes or so.
Yeah, the president putting out on our
show about soybeans and China.
And so the tit for tat continues.
Yeah, keeping an eye on that.
Having said that, guys with big banks
starting to report, not everybody got a
warm reception on Wall Street.
You do see the KBW bank index up about
1.7%.
So we are seeing some outperformance as
a whole when it comes to the bank names.
And I've been driving Carol crazy by
talking about crypto all the time, but
there is also read on the screen,
Bitcoin is down by almost 3%.
Etherium is leading the broader downturn
after Friday when the industry saw one
of the worst sell offs in history.
They're also all down.
It's basically read on the screen If you
type CEO wipe go.
That's interesting.
You do have gold actually rising and I
look at that because when you say
bitcoin now I think debasement trade
right but gold is actually up three
quarters of 1% so spot is at 4141, which
if I'm not mistaken, would be yet
another record high for the yellow
metal.
It has been just nuts trying to follow
gold so far this year.
I mean, you've had twin rallies when it
comes to gold, when it comes to
equities, and that's certainly what
you're seeing today.
Or you had been relative for 15
sentiment anyway.
The S&P 500, it will finish just
slightly lower, just about a 10th of a
percent.
We are very close to all time highs,
even with that piece that we did see on
Friday.
The Nasdaq down a bit more, down about
7/10 of a percent when it comes to the
Nasdaq.
The Dow Jones, we look at that for some
reason higher by about half of a
percent.
It's a price weighted index.
So I don't know how much salt you want
to put there.
But in any case, Carol, it looks like we
did see that decline, but very, very
tepid losses overall, Katie, hitting on
the Dow.
Again, I'm just going to put it out
there.
I know.
I know.
S&P 500, let's go back there, folks,
despite are down for the day overall.
You look inside the index, Matt, and
you've got 389 names actually in the S&P
500 gaining ground today, 113 to the
downside, one unchanged.
I was a young buck doing my first Wall
Street internship at Tucker Anthony.
Tell me more.
John Hancock coming back when the Dow
crossed through 6000.
What did you do?
How do you celebrate?
And you know what?
I was the guy in the office.
I was the kid who could use the
Bloomberg terminal.
Wow.
And so that was like my only skill and I
didn't do much else.
They call you Maddie back then.
I just called you Maddie on air.
We were getting ready to come to you
guys.
I don't think so.
Here's the IMAP, which is a look at the
industry group breakdown on the S&P 500.
You can see that the tech stocks are not
saving the day, down about one and a
half percent.
All of the index is only down by 2/10 of
1%.
So you did have more groups winning than
losing.
And as Carol points out, the financials
are the biggest gainers, up about 1.2%,
even though even though
Jp morgan and Goldman Sachs both fell
after earnings, that beat analysts
estimates.
Right.
Kind of impressive to see that.
All right.
So let's get to Matt kind of setting me
up really well.
Let's get to some of the individual
gainers, if I may.
So we know that Citi and JPMorgan, not
Citi, Jp morgan and Goldman not having
such a great day and not getting such a
warm reception on Wall Street.
Having said that, Citigroup and Wells
Fargo certainly did.
They showed some outperformance.
Citi at the close here, up 3.9%.
Wells Fargo a gain of more than 7%, some
real outperformance.
Wells Fargo, by the way, the top gainer
in the S&P 500 today, You did have them
beating Wall Street revenue estimates
across all five of its major business
lines, total revenue jumping 9%.
Markets, banking services.
I mean, these companies are really some
outperformance for Wells Fargo.
We talked to Alison Williams here on
Bloomberg Businessweek Daily.
And, you know, finally, it seems like
they are just kind of getting their
house in order and their metrics really
impressive.
And because we know that they've had a
couple of years where it's been really,
really tough.
So anyway, real outperformance in those
and we get ready for some more big banks
tomorrow.
Advanced Micro was up 4%, finishing the
day with a gain of about 8/10 of a
percent top gainer in the stocks today.
AMD coming out saying Oracle will deploy
a large batch of its forthcoming AMD
1450 chips next year.
So Oracle is going to put about 50,000
of those semi conductors and data center
computers starting in the third quarter
of 2026.
So we've just seen a lot of
announcements between chip companies and
other companies involving AI and the
way.
Even knows, like Black knows how much
that is?
50,000.
Is that a lot of chips or is that a
little, I don't know, throwaway.
We throw around these massive numbers,
Right.
About gigawatts of of power and I now I
no longer know 50,000 ships is a lot.
It does make your head spin.
I've just got to say, Ian King, I'm
watching a monitor and he's just getting
ready and set up and sitting down.
We're going to actually ask that
question to him in just a moment.
And Walmart, could I mention them up
about 5% in today's session.
Stock on pace.
I think they closed maybe at a record
high today, and that's after an
announcement from the retail giant,
which we will get to.
More on that in just a moment.
Let's get to the cleaners.
We have shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac ending the day lower with each
stocks seeing their fourth straight day
of losses.
Fannie Mae is down by 8%.
Freddie Mac is down by nearly 10%.
Bloomberg Intelligence says that
investors are finally starting to see a
dilution risk.
So in August, Bloomberg reported that
the Trump administration is considering
selling shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac in an offering that could start as
early as this year.
Up next, have Orian or Ryan.
I should have asked Karl how to
pronounce that, but shares are tumbling
down.
They were down as much as 23%.
That's the lowest intraday since August
2024.
But they closed the day lower by just
16%.
So this company supplies chemical
products like carbon black for coatings,
painting inks, rubber and other
applications for electric vehicles that
a company cut their guidance.
That comes as management reduces
production levels and as we see
continued weakness in the tire industry.
Orion is Orion is the hunter whom Guyana
loves.
Thank you.
I should have asked you.
Okay.
Last we had to send core, it's down by
more than 10%, 10.9, almost 11 that it
tumbled as much as 17% intraday, most
since May.
So this comes out there.
RBC said that a leaked abstract for the
biotech's experimental antibody for
patients with renal cell carcinoma.
Maybe Matt would know more about that.
Also may suggest interplay and the
future efficacy will determine path
forward.
That was really a mouthful.
I looked into the ballpark and it was
actually open today.
Not like yesterday.
We can actually check yields right now.
And you can see there was a little bit
of a rally.
When you take a look at the front end of
the yield curve.
We did hear from Fed Chair Jerome Powell
basically saying that we could see
further declines in job openings that
might show up in unemployment.
But overall, it seems like rate cut
expectations pretty much unchanged
versus where we were yesterday.
Slight rally when it comes to the front
end, a little bit of weakness when it
comes to the ultimate long end.
But overall, a pretty quiet day overall
when it comes to the bond market Carol.
All right.
Welcome world to your new search engine.
This story we've been talking about here
at Bloomberg Walmart partnering with
Openai, who isn't partnering with Openai
at this point to offer shopping on chat
GPT.
So users will be able to basically shop
Walmart's assortment directly on
chatbots by clicking a buy button with
the catalog, including apparel and or
team at package food and other products.
But I just do feel like we need to think
about chatbots is just our new search
engine or cloud record in Germany or
like, right.
Lama Lama Man, my main gripe here is
that fresh food isn't included in the
offering, partly because consumers buy
similar products weekly.
But that's exactly why it should be.
Because I do my shopping online, grocery
shopping, and I forgot to order eggs
last night.
I mean, I want to remind me that every
week you need to order eggs.
So it's come it should include that it's
coming.
But I also use chat chip to cook.
Do you not use do you not use it for
recipes?
I don't cook or use Chat's helpful.
So in that case I agree with you as
well.
I will say it is amazing to see Wal-Mart
shares react so strongly to this news
closing up at a record high, up nearly
5%, if only open.
I was a public company.
We could check in on those shares as
well.
I would imagine they'd be skyrocketing.
But when you say fresh food, does that
include pop tarts?
Oh,
Doritos.
I don't know if Pop Tarts count as fresh
food.
Definitely not.
Good news.
They're going to have more protein.
This is a really interesting story
coming out of CÃ©line over that is your
pop tart maker that apparently the new
versions of Pop Tarts will have ten
grams of protein per serving in three
different flavors, which is exciting for
the subset of the population that is
really into protein right now.
I am among them.
I don't know if I will be trying protein
pop tarts, but you saw Starbucks, for
example, recently introduced protein
lattes and protein cold foam.
It's everywhere.
Have you tried a protein latte?
Of course I have.
Is it too too much money?
They're not bad.
I have to say, this is dusty to me.
I'm just going to point out in this
story, it says that the sugar content
will be similar to regular pop tarts,
which have about 30 grams of sugar per
serving, depending on the flavor.
That's roughly 60% of the recommended
daily intake.
So the health food but 200 can look 200
calories a serving ten grams of protein
in 200 calories.
That's pretty good relative to the
benchmark, which is a normal pop
Pop-Tarts.
Not that.
But it.
Maybe we should get protein from real
protein.
Yeah, Maybe we should do it in those
eggs that Isabella forgot to buy.
Tuna.
Like eggs.
Like eggs.
Egg.
Exactly.
Thank you.
Just going to say.
