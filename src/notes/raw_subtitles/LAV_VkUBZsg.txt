All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 close.


We
 are
 here
 and
 we
 are
 live.
 It
 is


Monday,
 October
 20th.
 It
 has
 been
 a


pretty
 wild
 day.
 not
 only
 across
 the


stock
 market
 but
 also
 across
 two
 of
 the


major
 brokerages
 that
 all
 of
 us
 use
 to


engage
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 which
 would


be
 Weeble
 and
 Hood.
 I
 think
 it's
 pretty


much
 fixed.
 Let
 me
 know
 on
 your
 side.
 Uh


Weeble
 started
 working
 and
 Hood
 started


working
 about
 20
 minutes
 ago
 like
 like


really
 good
 for
 me.
 I
 haven't
 played


with
 Legend
 too
 much
 but
 on
 the
 mobile


app
 it
 was
 good.
 I
 think
 Legend
 should


be
 okay.
 S&P
 500


1.1%
 on
 the
 day
 folks.
 We
 are
 less
 than


$2
 away
 from
 all-time
 highs.
 And
 based


on
 some
 of
 the
 stuff
 that
 we're
 going
 to


talk
 about
 today,
 I
 do
 think
 this
 is
 a


healthy
 run
 back
 to
 alltime
 highs
 if
 we


get
 there
 again.
 673.95
 is
 that
 alltime


high.
 We're
 at
 671.81.


Robin
 Hoodie
 up
 5%
 even
 though
 it
 was


not
 working
 for
 pretty
 much
 the
 entirety


of
 the
 day.
 Palanteer
 up
 2%.
 Tesla
 up


2%.
 Nvidia
 relatively
 flat.
 AMD
 3.36.
 It


almost
 hit
 243.
 So,
 what
 a
 day
 for
 SoFi.


28.64.
 That's
 up
 8%
 on
 the
 day.
 It
 looks


like
 it
 wants
 to
 potentially
 make
 a
 run


to
 29.
 We
 got
 12
 minutes
 left.
 It
 hit


28.93.
 But
 even
 if
 it
 closes
 above
 2850,


I
 think
 everyone
 should
 be
 pretty
 happy


about
 SoFi.
 You
 got
 Grab,
 that's
 up
 a


little
 bit
 on
 the
 day.
 Google
 up
 1.3%.


Amazon
 for
 some
 reason
 I
 really
 it
 was


not
 in
 my
 bingo
 card
 that
 Amazon
 would


be
 hitting
 216
 from
 2:12
 in
 the
 morning


after
 this
 AWS
 outage
 which
 is
 still


affecting
 a
 lot
 of
 parts
 of
 the
 internet


but
 I
 think
 around
 80%
 of
 it
 has
 been


resolved
 uh
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 of


hours
 and
 so
 it's
 starting
 to
 get
 better


but
 Amazon's
 up
 on
 the
 day
 Meta
 is
 up
 2%


Salesforce
 is
 up
 5%
 PayPal's
 up
 3%
 Apple


26355
 the
 stock
 was
 at
 185
 less
 than


three
 months
 ago
 Apple
 stock
 has
 hit
 a


all-time
 high
 this
 is
 almost
 7%
 of
 the


S&P
 500
 and
 it's
 only
 up
 8%
 year
 to
 date


after
 hitting
 these
 all-time
 highs.
 I


did
 not
 buy
 SoFi
 today.
 No,
 it
 kind
 of


ran
 away
 for
 me.
 So,
 we'll
 we'll
 see
 if


we
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 dip
 during
 the


week.
 If
 not,
 maybe
 we'll
 sell
 some
 puts


going
 into
 uh
 going
 into
 earnings,
 but


we'll
 figure
 out
 what
 to
 do
 with
 SoFi


going
 into
 the
 next
 week.
 I
 did
 I
 did
 do


one
 trade.
 My
 Nebius
 people,
 you'll
 be


happy.
 I
 sold
 a
 put
 on
 Nebius.
 Nebus


down
 4.6%.
 All
 the
 data
 center
 plays


actually
 taking
 a
 little bit
 of a
 hit.


Nebus
 and
 Cororeweave.
 Is
 Iran
 still


down?
 Wow.
 Coreweave
 down
 7%.
 Ian,
 are


they
 down?
 They
 Yeah,
 I
 508
 555.
 All


right,
 so
 all
 the
 data
 centers
 took
 a


hit.
 I
 still
 don't
 know
 the
 the
 headline


with
 Oracle.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 this
 is


down
 5%.
 I
 know
 you
 guys
 in
 the
 morning


mentioned
 stuff
 about
 gross
 margins.
 I


couldn't
 find
 any
 meaningful
 like


validity
 to
 those
 headlines
 as
 a
 reason


for
 why
 the
 stocks
 to
 get
 down,
 but
 I


guess
 I'm
 wrong.
 There's
 got
 to
 be


something
 out
 there
 that's
 taking
 it


down
 5%.
 And
 it
 seems
 like
 that's


affecting
 the
 broader
 sector
 around
 data


centers.
 But
 uh
 I
 sold
 a
 put
 on
 Nebas


for
 $98,


uh
 for
 this
 week
 and
 I
 actually
 got
 paid


1.2%
 of
 my
 money.
 I'm
 like
 I
 I
 I
 kind
 of


wouldn't
 mind
 owning
 Nebas
 at
 98
 under


100
 was
 my
 target
 and
 uh
 if
 it
 gets


there
 and
 I
 get
 paid
 a$120,
 then
 you


know
 I'm
 okay
 with
 that
 circle
 right


there.
 That's
 up
 3%
 on
 the
 day.
 So


that's
 the
 only
 trade
 I
 made,
 but


regardless
 uh
 it
 does
 seem
 like
 some
 of


these
 stocks
 took
 a
 little bit
 of
 a
 hit


in
 the
 data
 center
 space.
 Outside
 of


that
 data
 center
 space,
 you
 got
 pretty


much
 everything
 that's
 going
 green
 on


the
 day
 except


D-Wave.
 Take
 a
 look
 at
 Quantum
 down
 12%


on
 the
 day.
 Oaklo
 was
 down
 5%.
 Recovered


a
 little
 bit.
 No,
 never
 mind.
 Well,
 now


it's
 down
 3%.
 So,
 yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,


technically
 that
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


recovery,
 but
 still
 down
 3%
 on
 the
 day.


154
 to
 158.
 At
 one
 point
 it
 was
 at
 170.


Not
 horrible
 to
 see.
 Uh,
 and
 then
 you


had
 a
 bunch
 of
 the
 other
 quantum
 names


like
 a
 Regetti,
 that's
 down
 8%
 on
 the


day.
 SMR
 in
 the
 nuclear
 space,
 that's


down.25%.
 Nanukar,
 that
 was
 also
 down


4%.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 very
 very
 very


healthy
 to
 see.
 And
 the
 reason
 this
 is


very
 healthy
 to
 see
 and
 I
 was
 talking


about
 this
 in
 the
 morning.
 I
 really


really
 do
 believe
 in
 this
 I
 mean
 I
 I


have
 a
 lot
 of
 confidence
 in
 this
 idea
 uh


just
 based
 on
 I
 guess
 how
 I'm
 thinking


of
 this
 bull
 market
 continuing
 and
 and


kind
 of
 the
 the
 PTSD
 I
 have
 from
 2021.


But
 with
 Trump
 deescalating
 with
 China,


with
 rates
 coming
 down,
 and
 with


earnings
 being
 strong,
 and
 hopefully


that
 continuing
 throughout
 the
 next


couple
 weeks,
 the
 worst
 thing
 we
 could


imagine
 is
 if
 all
 these
 frothy
 names


that
 have
 zero
 revenue,
 zero
 earnings,


quite
 frankly,
 they
 have
 hyped
 up


narratives
 that
 don't
 actually
 manifest


in
 reality.
 Seeing
 them
 get
 back
 to


all-time
 highs
 with
 the
 S&P
 500,
 not
 a


good
 thing.
 I
 think
 that
 would
 be
 a


clown
 market.
 I
 think
 that
 would
 be


excess
 liquidity.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 every


valuation
 is
 cheap
 right
 now,
 but
 I
 am


saying
 that
 a
 random
 stock
 that
 says


we're
 a
 quantum
 nuclear
 uh
 mechanistic


program
 to
 change
 society
 pumping
 150%.


Like
 that
 is
 not
 what
 we
 want
 to
 see.


And
 so
 quality
 companies
 like
 Apple
 and


AMD
 getting
 alltime
 highs
 today,
 that's


bullish.
 The
 10-year
 below
 4%,
 that's


bullish.
 The
 S&P
 500
 $2
 away
 from


alltime
 highs,
 that's
 bullish.
 And


seeing
 some
 of
 these
 quantum
 names,


these
 nuclear
 names
 down.
 Again,
 they're


not
 horrible
 companies.
 It's
 not
 a
 shot


at
 those
 companies.
 It's
 just
 even
 if


they
 were
 to
 fall
 30%,
 they
 would
 all
 be


up
 one
 to
 twox
 for
 the
 year.
 So,
 you


know,
 you've
 got
 another
 10
 20%
 down
 to


go
 and
 they
 would
 still
 be
 creating


phenomenal
 returns
 for
 shareholders
 that


bet
 early
 on
 them.
 But
 that
 momentum


would
 die
 out
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 healthy


for
 some
 of
 that
 momentum
 to
 rotate
 into


the
 broader
 market.
 Now,
 Beyond
 Meat,
 I


can't
 defend.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 hell


is
 happening
 with
 Beyond
 Meat
 today.


This
 makes
 this
 makes
 the
 clown
 market


thesis
 kind
 of
 come
 back
 to
 life.
 125%


up
 on
 the
 day.
 I
 think
 these
 guys
 were


supposed
 to
 go
 bankrupt
 and
 maybe
 they


announced
 something
 today
 that
 is


denying
 their
 bankruptcy
 or
 is
 flipping


the
 direction
 of
 that.
 If
 anyone
 has
 the


headline,
 let
 me
 know.
 But
 I
 don't


really
 see
 why
 Beyond
 Meat
 is
 up
 120%


today.
 Squeezing.
 Yeah,
 I
 guess


squeezing
 to
 an
 extent,
 but
 that
 could


be
 happening
 as
 well.
 Uh
 let
 me
 know


what
 people
 did.
 We
 got
 a
 bunch
 of
 other


headlines
 that
 we'll
 get
 into,
 but


ultimately,
 dude,
 I
 think
 this
 was
 a


really
 good
 day
 for
 the
 markets.
 I
 did


not
 expect
 to
 be
 this
 green.
 Uh
 but
 the


China
 deescalation
 stuff
 from
 yesterday


was
 very
 important
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 that


deescalation
 continuing
 to
 take
 place
 is


setting
 up
 a
 really
 strong
 uh
 potential


run
 going
 to
 earnings.
 Weeble
 right


there
 up
 4%
 on
 the
 day
 as
 well.
 Also


setting
 up
 a
 a
 good
 negotiation
 for
 Xi


and
 Trump
 to
 get
 into
 over
 the
 next


week.
 So
 the
 fact
 that
 we're
 getting


this
 type
 of
 momentum
 now
 maybe
 it's
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 bull
 trap
 and
 it's


getting
 a
 little
 too
 excited.
 Although
 I


do
 think
 the
 narrative
 is
 on
 the
 side
 of


the
 bulls
 right
 here,
 especially
 with


this
 China
 deescalation
 rhetoric
 that's


been
 coming
 from
 both
 sides
 over
 the


past
 48
 hours.
 wouldn't
 surprise
 me
 if


you
 know
 we
 take
 we
 give
 back
 a
 little


bit
 of
 this
 over
 the
 next
 few
 days
 but


if
 we
 can
 keep
 this
 going
 673
 is
 going


to
 happen
 over
 the
 next
 coming
 days
 and


that'd
 be
 very
 very
 nice
 to
 also
 see
 uh


a
 lot
 of
 the
 earnings
 are
 going
 to
 be


happening
 over
 the
 next
 week
 but
 we
 do


have
 Netflix
 and
 Amazon
 or
 Netflix
 and


Tesla
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 that


ends
 up
 playing
 out
 where's
 the
 rare


earth
 companies
 all
 of
 them
 well
 some
 of


them
 are
 down
 some
 of
 them
 are
 up
 on
 the


day
 US
 is
 up
 14%
 MP
 is
 up
 3%
 CRML's
 down


five
 TMQ
 is
 down
 five
 now
 the
 Bitcoin


miners
 turned
 data
 centers
 a
 little bit


of a
 mixed
 bag.
 Irene's
 down
 2%
 but


CleanSpark
 it
 was
 up
 almost
 15%
 now
 it's


up
 4%
 they
 associated
 or
 they
 uh
 they


they
 made
 someone
 a
 new
 senior
 VP
 of


data
 centers
 Jeffrey
 Thomas
 which
 is


super
 bullish
 for
 them.
 Bit
 farm's


basically
 flat
 on
 the
 day.
 Marathon
 up


7%
 again
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 bearish


that
 it's
 down
 2%.
 I
 think
 it's
 healthy.


I
 has
 had
 a
 massive
 run
 for
 INE
 to


consolidate
 right
 here
 seems
 pretty


normal
 to
 me
 which
 would
 not
 be
 too


crazy.
 Riot
 is
 up
 10%
 on
 the
 day
 and


then
 Galaxy
 is
 up
 5%
 as
 well.
 Now
 gold


in
 the
 morning,
 gold
 was
 down
 just
 a


little
 bit.
 That
 lasted
 for
 a
 little


bit.
 Gold
 right
 here
 is
 15
 bucks
 away


from
 breaking
 4,400.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 to
 tell
 you
 guys.
 We


talked
 about
 it
 a
 lot
 last
 night.
 Uh
 you


know,
 we
 we
 talked
 about
 it
 this
 morning


with
 the
 central
 reserves
 uh
 uh
 central


bank
 reserves
 across
 the
 entire
 world


having
 20%
 of
 their
 global
 reserves


inside
 of
 gold.
 This
 is
 the
 chart
 that


we
 looked
 at
 this
 morning.
 I
 don't
 know,


dude.
 It's
 It's
 one
 of
 those
 trades


that's
 becoming


I
 don't
 want
 to
 say
 it's
 becoming
 a


bubble,
 but
 it
 is
 be
 the
 perception
 of


it
 is
 that
 it
 is
 becoming
 euphoric.
 Um,


a
 run
 to
 5,000
 I
 think
 would
 truly
 make


it
 more
 euphoric,
 especially
 if
 we
 don't


have
 a
 reason
 for
 why
 it's
 happening.
 I


hesitate
 to
 say
 it's
 a
 short
 because


it's
 freaking
 gold,
 you
 know?
 And
 like,


do
 you
 really
 want
 to
 short
 gold?
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that's
 the
 best
 idea.
 Is


it
 a
 buy
 right
 now?
 Again,
 I'm
 not
 a


commodities
 expert,
 but
 h
 something


having
 a
 run
 like
 that
 and
 not
 just
 some


random
 stock,
 but
 we're
 talking
 about


freaking
 gold
 having
 a
 run
 like
 that,
 it


it
 is
 very
 very
 hard
 to
 uh
 to
 be
 super


optimistic
 to
 buy
 it
 here.
 The


riskreward
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 it's
 that


aggressive,
 but
 nonetheless,
 you
 got


gold
 gain
 some
 momentum.
 Uh
 thoughts
 on


the
 Australia
 rare
 earth
 deal.
 Okay,
 so


let's
 transition
 to
 that.
 So,
 uh,
 I


didn't
 get
 every
 highlight
 of
 what
 Trump


said
 with
 the
 Australian
 prime
 minister,


but
 they
 did
 meet
 today,
 and
 it
 looks


like
 it
 was
 a
 relatively
 bullish


conversation
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 they
 did


with
 Rare
 Earth
 Minerals.
 Here
 is
 the


agreement
 that
 they
 signed
 today.


>> And
 then
 we'll
 take
 some
 questions,


some
 good
 ones,
 I
 think.


Okay,


don't
 have
 the
 specifics
 on
 the
 deal,


but
 it
 is
 good
 that
 uh
 Australia
 and
 the


United
 States
 are
 collaborating
 on
 rare


earth
 minerals.
 This
 is
 also
 happening


with
 Ukraine.
 So
 the
 more
 that
 that
 the


more
 that
 we
 can
 get
 that
 into
 the


system,
 the
 more
 potentially
 we
 have
 to


avoid
 uh
 dealing
 with
 from
 China.
 And


then
 Trump
 here
 was
 his
 answer
 to
 a


question
 on
 China.


>> I
 think
 China's
 been
 very
 respectful
 of


us.
 They're
 paying
 tremendous
 amounts
 of


money
 to
 us
 as
 in
 the
 form
 of
 tariffs
 as


you
 know
 they're
 paying
 55%.
 That's
 they


never
 were
 paying
 anything
 over
 years


and
 years
 and
 years.
 Uh
 but
 they
 were


like
 anybody
 else.
 A
 lot
 of
 countries


took
 advantage
 of
 the
 US.
 They're
 not


taking
 advantage
 anymore.
 No,
 China's


paying
 55%
 and
 a
 potential


155%
 come
 November
 1st
 unless
 we
 make
 a


deal.
 I'm
 meeting
 with
 President
 Xi.
 We


have
 a
 very
 good
 relationship.
 We're


going
 to
 be
 meeting
 in
 South
 Korea
 in
 a


couple
 of
 weeks
 and
 uh
 we'll
 see
 what
 we


can
 do.
 Uh
 we
 have
 a
 very
 good


relationship
 with
 China,
 but
 you
 know,


it's
 been
 uh
 it's
 been
 probably
 a
 little


bit
 like
 your
 relationship
 with
 China.


They
 try
 and
 take
 advantage,
 but
 most


countries
 do.
 I
 mean,
 I
 can
 say
 the


European
 Union
 took
 advantage
 and
 but


not
 anymore.
 We
 worked
 out
 a
 very
 fair


trade
 deal.
 Japan,
 we
 worked
 out
 a
 very


fair
 fair
 deal.
 uh
 South
 Korea
 where


I'll
 be
 meeting
 President
 Xi.
 We
 worked


out
 a
 very
 fair
 deal
 and
 I
 expect
 we'll


probably
 work
 out
 a
 very
 fair
 deal
 with


uh
 President
 Xi
 of
 China.
 So,
 uh
 most
 of


you
 will
 be
 with
 us.
 It's
 going
 to
 be


very
 exciting
 and
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to


work
 out
 something
 that's
 good
 for
 both


countries.


I
 mean,
 dude,
 is
 that
 not
 like
 that
 is
 a


full
 180
 from
 two
 weeks
 ago
 where
 he's


de
 from
 forget
 two
 weeks
 ago,
 from
 three


days
 ago
 when
 he
 was
 threatening
 that


we're
 going
 to
 not
 buy
 their
 cooking


oil.
 He's
 saying
 that
 China's
 been


friendly.
 They've
 been
 very
 respectful.


They've
 been
 paying
 tariffs.
 He
 is
 ready


to
 meet
 Xi
 in
 two
 weeks
 in
 South
 Korea.


I
 mean,
 I
 think
 that
 really
 is
 one
 of


the
 themes,
 at least
 of
 today,


potentially
 of
 this
 week,
 for
 why
 the


S&P
 is
 getting
 close
 to
 all-time
 highs.


You're
 just
 not
 seeing
 this
 like


aggressive


hostility
 and
 and
 escalation
 of
 of


rhetoric
 from
 Bent
 Vance,
 uh,
 Lutnik,


Trump
 or
 from
 the
 Chinese
 side,
 which
 I


think
 is
 very
 bullish
 and
 that
 is
 nice


to
 see.
 So,
 as
 a
 result,
 it
 seems
 like,


you
 know,
 the
 Trump
 China
 situation
 is


not
 going
 to
 be
 that
 bad.
 And
 if
 you


have
 that
 going
 into
 a
 good
 earnings,
 I


think
 it
 sets
 up
 a
 potential
 run
 going


into
 Q3.
 Amazon
 right
 there
 up
 1.67%
 on


the
 day.
 Meta
 732
 finally
 breaking
 up


from
 that
 730s.
 And
 then
 SoFi
 looks
 like


it's
 going
 to
 end
 the
 day
 above
 2850,


which
 is
 very
 nice
 to
 see.
 Hopefully


making
 that
 run
 for
 30
 going
 into
 the


end
 of
 the
 week.
 Spot
 gold
 rises
 to


another
 record
 at
 4383.2%


on
 the
 day.
 Let
 me
 know
 if
 anyone
 is


buying
 gold.
 Uh
 silver,
 by
 the
 way,
 and


we're
 going
 to
 get
 into
 a
 bunch
 of
 these


headlines,
 but
 silver,
 there
 was
 a
 place


in
 India
 that
 for
 the
 first
 time
 ever,


India's
 largest
 metal
 refinery
 just
 ran


out
 of
 silver.
 That
 was
 a
 headline
 that


came
 out
 two
 hours
 ago.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 I


mean,
 people
 are
 ready
 to
 buy
 silver.


They're
 ready
 to
 buy
 gold.
 And
 you
 are


seeing
 it
 in
 the
 data
 and
 you're


obviously
 seeing
 in
 the
 price
 action.


It's
 just
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we
 can


meaningfully
 explain
 why
 people
 are
 that


excited.
 It's
 either
 massive
 inflation


is
 coming
 or
 there's
 massive


geopolitical
 problems.
 You're
 not
 seeing


either
 of
 those
 manifest
 as
 easily
 right


now.
 But
 still,
 commodities
 are


continuing
 to
 make
 a
 run.
 Yeah,
 look
 at


Andy
 bought
 some
 gold
 last
 week
 at


Costco.
 See,
 everyone's
 everyone's


buying
 it.
 Everyone
 is
 freaking
 buying


gold
 and
 silver.
 All right,
 there
 we
 go.


Monday,
 October
 20th.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 It
 is
 400
 p.m.


It's
 been
 a
 wild
 day.
 Close
 to
 alltime


highs,
 but
 the
 stock
 market
 is
 now


closed.


All
 right,
 we're
 done
 on
 the
 day.
 What
 a


wild
 day
 it
 has
 been.
 By
 the
 way,
 Robin


didn't
 start
 working
 for
 me
 until
 like


40
 minutes
 ago.
 So,
 even
 after
 the


market
 market
 opened,
 while
 I
 was
 on
 the


way
 to
 uh
 to
 go
 get
 some
 steaks
 with
 our


friend
 Steve,
 which
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 think


this
 is
 the
 rarest
 steak
 I've
 had
 in
 my


life.
 We
 went
 to
 Uncle
 Jack's
 on
 34th.


I
 asked
 for
 medium.


That's
 not
 medium,
 bro.
 It
 was
 a
 great


steak
 and
 I
 ate
 it
 and
 I
 loved
 it,
 but


that's
 not
 medium,
 bro.
 Like,
 don't
 tell


me
 that.
 That
 is
 medium
 rare
 1,00%.
 That


is
 not
 medium.
 But
 it
 was
 a
 good
 thing.


But
 Robin,
 I
 couldn't
 even
 check
 prices


while
 we
 were
 at
 the
 uh
 while
 we
 were
 at


the
 restaurant
 because
 uh
 because
 it


wasn't
 working.
 There's
 uh
 there's
 Mr.


Milkman
 right
 there


eating
 his
 filt.
 So
 that
 was
 not
 medium,


right?
 I
 asked
 for
 medium
 and
 Steve
 was


like,
 "That's
 not
 medium."
 I
 was
 like,


"All
 right,
 here
 we
 go.
 Let's
 see
 what


it
 looks
 like."
 But
 it
 tasted
 good.
 Amit


became
 a
 man.
 Yes,
 I
 became
 a
 man
 today.


I
 became
 a
 man.
 It
 it
 it
 looks
 raw,


right?
 That's
 It
 looked
 raw
 to
 me,
 but


when
 I
 ate
 it,
 I
 was
 like,
 "This
 is
 not


too
 bad.
 It's
 okay."
 So
 maybe
 maybe
 I
 am


a
 medium
 rare
 guy.
 All right.
 S&P
 500


ends
 up
 1%
 of
 the
 day.
 671.18.


Not
 too
 bad
 to
 get
 the
 670
 close.
 And


not
 just
 670,
 671.
 I
 think
 that's
 very


nice
 to
 see.
 So
 up
 8%
 on
 the
 day.
 2865.


AMD
 3%.
 First
 240
 close
 ever.
 Correct
 me


if
 I'm
 wrong.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 the
 first


240
 close
 ever
 for
 AMD.
 Tesla
 447,


Pounder
 181,
 Robin
 Hood
 136,
 Rock
 Lab
 I


think
 67
 6750,
 not
 too
 bad.
 ESTs,
 that


one
 was
 8364
 basically
 flat
 on
 the
 day.


Duolingo
 down
 3%.
 They
 they
 got
 a
 couple


analyst
 upgrades.
 Still,
 the
 stock
 got


hit.
 TFC
 up
 2%
 on
 the
 day.
 Disney
 was
 up


1%.
 GameStop,
 Ryan
 Cohen
 did
 an


interview.
 I
 did
 not
 listen
 to
 it
 yet.


We'll
 try
 to
 get
 some
 tidbits
 and
 some


headlines
 from
 that
 interview,
 but
 that


stock
 was
 up
 about
 1%
 on
 the
 day.
 Eli


Liy
 was
 up
 21%.
 The
 Hims
 CEO
 tweeted
 uh


Hims
 was
 up
 2.8%
 %
 that
 they
 invested
 in


GR
 Grail.
 This
 stock
 was
 up
 17%
 on
 the


day.
 I
 don't
 know
 much
 about
 this


company
 final
 version.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the


$10
 super
 chat.
 He
 says
 Grail
 is
 early


cancer
 detection.
 HIMS
 took
 a
 stake


today.
 Last
 week,
 Samsung
 announced
 a


partnership
 and
 the
 results
 are
 like
 no


other
 in
 the
 market.
 It's
 worth
 a
 look.


Uh
 I
 will
 look
 into
 it.
 I
 will
 see.


Well,
 we've
 got
 $3.3
 billion
 company,


but
 HIMS
 did
 make
 an
 investment
 in
 that


today.
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 that


stock
 also
 got
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move.
 Intel


was
 up
 3%
 on
 the
 day.
 Iran
 down
 2%.
 I


think
 that's
 relatively
 healthy
 for
 some


of
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners.
 VIX
 was
 down
 11%.


If
 you
 went
 short
 VIX
 in
 the
 morning,


that
 one
 worked
 out.
 Or
 even
 if
 you


bought
 some
 puts
 on
 it,
 Lyft,
 right,


they're
 up
 2.8%.
 IWM,
 small
 caps,
 great


day.
 Small
 caps
 really
 outperforming
 the


broader
 S&P
 500,
 which
 is
 nice
 to
 see


for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 a
 couple
 years.


Cisco,
 uh,
 70
 bucks
 right
 there.
 That's


up
 1%.
 JD
 was
 up
 2%.
 Delta
 was
 up
 3.6%.


United
 Airlines
 had
 one
 of
 their
 best


earnings
 ever.
 That
 stock
 up
 another
 2%


on
 the
 day
 as
 well.


So,
 not
 too
 bad.
 Not
 too
 bad
 at
 all


across
 the
 entire
 market.
 And
 I
 think


overall
 a
 pretty
 healthy
 day.
 Wes
 says,


"Can
 we
 please
 get
 the
 S&P
 out
 of
 the


670s?
 My
 kids
 have
 ruined
 anything
 with


six
 and
 seven
 in
 it
 for
 me."
 Yeah,
 dude.


Whenever
 I
 say
 it,
 a
 bunch
 of
 you
 guys


like
 spam
 it
 in
 the
 chat,
 which
 is
 you


would
 think
 it's
 like
 a
 Tik
 Tok
 thing,


but
 no,
 it's
 not.
 Apparently,
 it's


become
 universal
 at
 this
 point.
 Uh,
 BMR,


how
 did
 we
 end
 on
 the
 day?
 5365.
 Tom
 Lee


bought
 203,000
 ETH
 over
 the
 past
 week,


which
 I
 think
 is
 pretty
 bullish
 in
 terms


of
 just
 their
 ability
 to
 keep
 raising


capital
 and
 continue
 to
 buy
 the
 asset


class.
 And
 then
 Oscar
 announced
 a


partnership
 with
 OpenAI
 today.
 The
 stock


really
 should
 have
 been
 up
 400%
 once
 you


announced
 that
 you're
 working
 with


OpenAI.
 The
 stock
 was
 only
 up
 4%.
 So


Oscar
 got
 the
 short
 end
 of
 the
 stick


right
 there,
 but
 they
 did
 indeed


announce
 Oswell,
 Oscar's
 new
 health
 AI


agent
 powered
 by
 OpenAI.


So,
 you
 got
 that
 that
 uh
 that
 had
 some


somewhat
 of
 a
 move
 today.


All right.
 So,
 there
 you
 go.
 Let's
 get


into
 some
 headlines
 as
 we
 get
 into


market
 close.
 Again,
 let
 me
 know
 if
 you


bought
 the
 dip
 today,
 if
 you
 sold
 any


puts,
 sold
 any
 calls,
 took
 advantage
 of


it.
 I
 mean,
 most
 people,
 if
 you're
 on


Robin
 Hood,
 I
 mean,
 some
 of
 you
 guys
 got


access
 to
 your
 account,
 but
 honestly,


most
 people
 did
 not
 get
 access
 until


like
 one
 o'clock
 or
 two
 o'clock.
 I
 don't


think
 I
 got
 access
 until
 3
 o'clock,
 to


be
 honest.
 So,
 it
 it
 definitely
 hasn't


been
 an
 easy
 day
 to
 navigate
 trades.


Weeble
 for
 some
 for
 some
 people
 I
 was


saying
 is
 still
 pretty
 pretty
 down
 and


not
 working.
 I
 think
 the
 the
 other
 main


headline
 today
 outside
 of
 the
 China


stuff
 is
 just
 how
 unbelievably


incredible
 AWS
 is
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 fact


that
 the
 entire
 internet
 or
 a
 decent


chunk
 of
 the
 internet
 runs
 on
 Amazon,


Google,
 Microsoft
 as
 well.
 I
 mean
 it
 is


so
 hard
 to
 be
 bearish
 these
 three


companies.
 And
 could
 you
 imagine
 if
 like


the
 servers
 that
 AWS
 was
 occupying
 for


Northeast
 not
 didn't
 just
 have
 like
 a


technical
 issue,
 but
 let's
 say
 there
 was


like
 a
 tornado
 or
 something
 and
 and
 it


completely
 got
 wrecked.
 I
 mean,
 dude,


like
 the
 the
 world
 would
 shut
 down
 if
 if


that
 happened.
 Like
 the
 these
 are
 such


important
 and
 pivotal
 companies
 to
 the


fabric
 of
 our
 society
 and
 it's
 hard
 to


be
 bearish
 on
 them.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


why
 Amazon
 stock
 was
 up
 on
 the
 day.
 I


mean,
 even
 with
 all
 the
 issues
 that
 they


had,
 and
 they're
 probably
 going
 to
 have


to
 give
 a
 lot
 of
 credits
 to
 make
 up
 for


some
 of
 the
 stuff,
 but
 21653
 up
 1.6%.
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 just
 recognize,


look,
 it's
 hard
 to
 be
 bearish
 on


something
 that's
 this
 important.
 That's


why
 Amazon
 got
 uh
 got
 some
 momentum
 on


the
 day.
 Eric
 said,
 "I
 sold
 I
 ran
 and
 I


bought
 more
 Na'vi."
 How
 did
 that
 one
 end


out
 the
 day?
 It
 was
 up
 20%
 Na'vi.
 Yeah,


17%
 pretty
 much
 ended
 near
 all-time


highs
 on
 the
 day.
 Um,
 I
 don't
 know
 if


any
 of
 you
 guys
 had
 a
 headline
 for
 me
 on


this
 or
 if
 this
 was
 just
 technical


outside
 of
 the
 Nvidia
 partnership
 from


last
 week,
 but
 really
 had
 a
 move.
 Oh


yeah,
 the
 short
 float
 is
 almost
 30%.


That's
 probably
 what
 potentially
 kicked


it
 off
 today.
 But
 17%
 of
 the
 day,


not
 too
 bad.
 Maybe
 the
 government
 will


take
 a
 stake
 in
 Amazon.
 Maybe


maybe
 that's
 what
 how
 it's
 going
 to
 play


out.
 Uh
 AWS
 says
 Lambda
 uh
 errors
 fully


recovered,
 function
 errors
 improving


further.
 Okay,
 so
 we
 do
 have
 some


updates
 from
 AWS.
 Let
 me
 actually
 click


on
 their
 website
 and
 get
 the
 exact


updates.


Um,


but
 it
 does
 seem
 like
 whatever
 errors


happened
 weren't
 necessarily
 errors
 from


like
 negligence,
 but
 have
 to
 do
 more


with
 the
 functionality
 of
 the
 servers


themselves.


How
 are
 we
 not
 read
 today
 with
 AWS
 being


down?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 I
 thought


Hood
 would
 go
 down
 as
 well.
 I
 mean,
 the


amount
 of
 people
 talking
 [ __ ]
 on
 X
 today


about
 Hood,
 I'm
 just
 like,
 goodness


gracious.
 You
 talk
 about
 herd
 mentality.


People
 just
 wanted
 to
 I
 mean
 it
 wasn't


even
 their
 fault.
 I'm
 not
 even
 trying
 to


defend
 them
 here.
 Like
 it
 just
 it
 it
 was


AWS.
 Like
 what
 do
 you
 want
 them
 to
 do
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day?
 Like
 are
 you
 really


going
 to
 [ __ ]
 on
 a
 company
 for
 for


something
 that
 quite
 frankly
 was
 not


their
 fault
 outside
 of
 choosing
 AWS?
 I


get
 it.
 People
 are
 allowed
 to
 be


emotional
 about
 it,
 but
 you
 got
 other


people
 that
 just
 like
 completely
 went
 to


town
 on
 these
 guys.
 And
 I'm
 like
 I
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 a
 sign
 of
 high


intelligence
 to
 be
 mad
 at
 something
 that


is
 not
 really
 their
 fault.
 But
 I
 can


understand
 emotionally
 why
 some
 people


are
 upset.
 But
 still,
 Hood
 was
 up
 5%
 on


the
 day
 even
 with
 all
 the
 pain
 that
 they


had.
 And
 that
 just
 showed
 how
 resilient


the
 market
 was
 in
 general
 and
 everything


was
 going
 up
 today
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 all


the
 pain
 that
 was
 going
 throughout
 the


entire
 market.


So,


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 that
 crazy.
 Schwab


was
 fine
 for
 me.
 Yeah,
 look,
 Schwab
 was


good
 because
 I
 guess
 to
 my


understanding,
 I
 don't
 know
 everything


about
 Schwab's
 business,
 but
 I
 guess


they
 don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 their
 servers


running
 on
 AWS,
 which
 is
 great
 for
 them,


but
 you
 can't
 blame
 a
 company.
 This
 is


not
 some
 random,
 you
 know,
 cloud
 company


that
 Hood
 picked
 in
 Indonesia.
 Like,


this
 is
 freaking
 AWS.


They
 do
 112
 billion
 in
 revenue.
 Like,


like
 this
 is
 like
 blaming
 them
 for
 a


mistake
 that
 is
 not
 theirs.
 To
 me,
 it's


just
 silly.
 And
 if
 SoFi
 had
 this
 issue


today,
 I
 wouldn't
 be
 blaming
 SoFi


either.
 Oh,
 it's
 SoFi's
 fault
 for


working
 with
 AWS.
 It's
 like,
 what
 what


what
 are
 you
 talking
 about?
 It's
 it's


your
 fault
 for
 picking
 one
 of
 the
 most


trusted
 clouds
 on
 the
 planet.
 Like,
 yes,


that's
 that's
 a
 very
 intellectually


smart
 way
 to,
 you
 know,
 I
 had
 some


people
 say
 smart
 money
 hedge
 funds


cracked
 AWS's
 servers
 just
 so
 they
 could


outrun
 retail
 today
 and
 that
 was
 their


strategy
 to
 get
 back
 at
 them
 for
 missing


the
 April
 dip.
 And
 you
 see
 some
 of
 these


comments
 and
 you're
 like,
 "Oh,
 wow.


There's
 like
 there's
 really
 a
 disconnect


between
 how
 some
 people
 think
 about
 the


world
 because
 Smart
 Money
 for
 sure
 has


zero
 exposure
 to
 AWS."
 Yes.
 all
 these


hedge
 funds,
 they
 have
 no
 exposure
 to


Amazon
 Web
 Services.
 That
 makes
 a
 ton
 of


sense.
 That
 is
 very,
 very
 smart.
 You


know,
 it's
 like,
 no,
 that
 doesn't
 make


that
 doesn't
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.


Nonetheless,
 I
 didn't
 expect
 Hood
 to
 go


up
 5%
 on
 the
 day,
 but
 it
 still
 was.


Pounder
 was
 up
 2%
 on
 the
 day.
 So,
 again,


massive
 day,
 up
 8%
 as
 well,
 and
 that
 was


getting
 some
 momentum.
 Closed
 at
 28.68


on
 the
 day.
 All
 right,
 so
 let's
 get
 into


some
 of the
 headlines
 and
 then
 we
 will


keep
 going
 from
 there.
 All
 right,
 so


first
 headline,
 Coinbase
 option
 flow


massive.
 It
 looks
 like
 whales
 are


betting
 pretty
 heavy
 on
 something


happening
 with
 Coinbase.
 A
 lot
 of these


calls
 are
 in
 the
 350
 to
 450
 range
 for


November
 2025.
 So
 if
 you
 are
 into


Coinbase,
 you've
 got
 some
 of the
 whales


from
 the
 option
 flow
 perspective


deciding
 to
 get
 on
 the
 bandwagon.
 We're


seeing
 this
 also
 happen
 with
 Tesla.


Tesla
 today
 continuing
 to
 ramp
 up
 the


5520
 calls
 for
 December
 19th,
 2025.
 You


had
 about
 10
 million
 worth
 of
 options
 uh


that
 were
 bought
 on
 that
 52550
 call
 for


Tesla.
 Again,
 I'm
 not
 the
 most


optimistic
 going
 into
 Tesla
 earnings
 in


terms
 of
 the
 stock
 price.
 I
 really
 don't


think
 the
 stock's
 going
 to
 tank.
 I
 also


don't
 think
 there's
 a
 massive
 catalyst


for
 the
 stock
 to
 go
 higher.
 Could
 it
 go


higher
 for
 whatever
 reason?
 Sure.
 I'm


just
 not
 sure
 exactly
 what
 Tesla
 the


company
 will
 be
 able
 to
 put
 up
 in
 terms


of
 results
 to
 get
 that
 stock
 to
 go
 high.


So,
 I
 think
 there
 is
 some
 anticipation


of
 a
 run.
 That's
 why
 Tesla
 was
 up
 2%
 on


the
 day.
 Maybe
 it
 continues
 to
 run


tomorrow,
 but
 Wednesday,
 we
 will
 get


those
 results
 and
 then
 we're
 going
 to


see
 what
 happens
 with
 Tesla


as
 well.
 What
 is
 Apple's
 market
 cap?


Let's
 get
 an
 update
 on
 all
 the


companies.
 Wow.
 3.89
 trillion.
 Okay.
 So,


Nvidia's
 at
 4.5.
 Apple's
 at
 3.8.
 Apple


basically


what
 3
 4%
 away
 from
 4
 trillion.
 Less


than
 that.
 Microsoft's
 at
 3.841.
 Google


Google's
 at
 3.
 Oh
 wow.
 Google
 Google


closed
 at
 257.
 That's
 an
 all-time
 high


close
 for
 Google.
 All right.
 So
 Google


Google
 25650.
 It
 hit
 257,
 but
 did
 get


officially
 to
 a
 $3
 trillion
 market
 cap


as
 well.
 Well,
 3.1
 trillion.
 So
 they


added
 100
 billion.
 And
 then
 Amazon
 still


at
 2.3
 trillion
 on
 today.
 SoFi
 earnings


will
 be
 next
 week.
 SoFi
 earnings
 will
 be


next
 week
 on
 Tuesday
 the
 28th.
 We'll
 be


live
 in
 the
 morning.
 We'll
 see
 what


those
 SoFi
 results
 look
 like.
 Shout
 out


to
 Mr.
 Josh
 in
 the
 chat.
 That
 is
 a
 a


nice
 little
 move
 on
 the
 portfolio
 even


if
 he
 couldn't
 make
 any
 trades
 today


because
 it's
 on
 Robin
 Hood.
 760,000


up


based
 on
 SoFi


uh
 going
 green
 8%
 on
 the
 day.
 I
 think


Josh,
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong,
 has
 200,000


shares
 of
 SoFi,
 150
 to
 200,000.


So,
 that's
 a
 very
 nice
 day
 as
 you
 get


some
 of
 this


SoFi
 momentum.
 Are
 there
 earnings
 after


hours?
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 any


earnings
 today.


Are
 there
 earnings?
 Let
 me
 check
 real


quick.
 I
 didn't
 I
 I
 felt
 like
 there


weren't
 any
 earnings.
 300,000,
 bro.


Wait,
 Josh,
 what
 is
 your
 average?
 When


did
 you
 buy
 those
 extra
 100,000
 shares?


Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.


That
 is
 a
 lot.
 Yeah,
 we
 have
 no
 earnings


after
 hours.
 At least
 not
 any
 that
 I


see.
 We
 had
 a
 couple
 earnings
 in
 the


morning,
 but
 no
 earnings
 after
 hours.


Tomorrow
 is
 when
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 the


most
 earnings.
 And
 then
 we're
 going
 to


see
 what
 happens
 from
 there.


Bro,
 I
 have
 leaps.


All right.
 Well,


that's
 conviction.
 That
 is
 conviction.


That
 is
 massive.


Massive
 conviction.


So
 there
 you
 go.
 Beyond
 Meat
 did
 get
 a


short
 squeeze.
 Zion
 is
 today.
 Is
 it


right
 now?
 Really?


I
 I
 thought
 this
 was
 tomorrow.
 Let
 me


confirm.
 Zion.


Oh
 yeah,
 we
 do
 have
 earnings
 today.


Okay.
 Zion
 results.
 Uh
 221
 million
 of


net
 income
 148
 a
 share.
 Uh
 company


reported
 pre-provision
 net
 revenue
 of


14%
 year-over-year.
 Net
 interest
 margin


increase
 of
 25
 basis
 points.
 loans


contracted
 at
 3%
 annualized
 linked


quarter
 rate.


A
 50
 million
 charge
 off
 as
 well.
 Wait,


what?
 Didn't
 Zion
 No,
 Zions
 had
 earnings


last
 week,
 guys.
 Zions
 was
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 we
 had
 that
 private
 credit


issue.


Yeah,
 it
 was
 Zions
 and
 and
 Western


Alliance.


Maybe
 they
 put
 out
 an
 update
 after


hours,
 but
 what
 I'm
 looking
 at
 right


here
 is
 the
 results
 from
 last
 week.


Yeah,
 Zions
 was
 the
 reason
 the
 market


got
 upset
 on
 Wednesday.
 So
 I
 don't
 think


or
 they
 announced
 preliminary
 results
 on


Thursday
 and
 today
 we
 have
 actual


results.


Yeah,
 that
 might
 be
 the
 reason
 which
 is


even
 crazier
 if
 last
 week
 the
 market


went
 down
 just
 on
 preliminary
 results.


Zion
 Q3
 earnings
 earnings
 adjusted
 beat


148
 year
 up
 2.8%
 from
 144.


Okay.
 Well,
 Zion's
 right
 there
 5320.


That
 is
 up
 7%
 on
 the
 day.
 go
 to
 their


website
 and
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 some
 more


details
 on
 what
 we've
 got
 from
 Zions.


These
 were
 the
 top
 20
 stocks
 that
 were


traded
 in
 the
 options
 market
 today.


Apple
 was
 number
 one.
 Beyond
 Meat
 was


number
 two.


A
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 weird
 timeline,
 but


Apple
 1.5
 million
 options,
 Beyond
 Meat


1.4
 million.
 Then
 you
 had
 Nvidia
 and


Tesla.
 Then
 AMD,
 IBIT,
 Amazon,
 SoFi,


Intel,
 Oracle,
 Pounder,
 Open
 Door,
 Hood,


Weeble,
 Marathon,
 SMCI,
 Cleveland
 Cliff,


Strategy,
 Meta,
 and
 Baba.
 I
 still
 don't


understand
 the
 headline
 on
 Beyond
 Meat


outside
 of
 the
 squeeze.
 I
 don't
 know


what
 the
 catalyst
 was
 to
 create
 the


squeeze
 because
 from
 my
 understanding,


these
 guys
 are
 supposed
 to
 be
 going


bankrupt,


but


I
 don't
 understand.
 One
 billion
 shares


of
 volume
 for
 Beyond
 Meat.
 Yeah,
 you're


right.
 One
 billion
 shares
 of
 volume.
 I


don't
 see
 a
 single
 headline
 on
 Beyond


Meat
 outside
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 people


piled
 in
 today,
 which
 yeah,
 look,
 it's


not
 healthy
 to
 see
 that.
 I
 don't
 know


why
 that's
 happening,
 but
 it's
 almost


like
 people
 left
 nuclear
 and
 quantum
 and


they
 turned
 into
 vegans
 today.
 And
 I


guess
 that's
 what


from
 fake
 meat
 to
 fake
 stock.
 Yeah.
 I


mean,
 like
 I
 guess
 that
 was
 the


rationale
 today.
 But
 overall,
 I
 think
 it


was
 really
 good
 that
 we
 didn't
 see
 uh
 we


we
 we
 really
 didn't
 see
 a
 ton
 of
 the


random
 names
 that
 have
 been
 running
 up


for
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 continue
 to


run.


And
 I
 think
 that
 was
 the
 best
 part
 about


the
 report
 today.
 Q3
 for
 Zions.
 Do
 we


have
 it?


Uh,
 yeah,
 here
 it
 is.
 Looks
 like
 this


just
 came
 out.
 So,
 221
 million
 in


revenue,
 1.48
 on
 EPS,


3.2.8%


net
 margin.
 Zion's
 after
 hours.
 This


stock
 is
 up.
 I
 believe
 we
 are
 up
 2.64%.


Wow.
 So,
 I
 guess
 last
 week
 the
 charge


off
 and
 the
 provision
 for
 credit
 losses


they
 reported
 weren't
 earnings.
 It
 was


like
 preliminary
 results
 or
 something


that
 they
 had
 to
 legally
 disclose
 before


the
 actual
 earnings.
 And
 today
 we're


getting
 the
 actual
 earnings
 and
 you're


not
 seeing


uh
 you're
 not
 seeing
 that
 much
 pain.


Yeah.
 So,
 this
 was
 the
 this
 is
 what
 we


got
 on
 October
 15th.
 Zion
 saying
 they


became
 aware
 of
 legal
 actions
 initiated


by
 several
 other
 banks
 for
 faulty
 loans.


That's
 what
 caused
 that
 kind
 of
 regional


banking
 credit
 concern.
 But
 the
 actual


earnings,
 you're
 not
 seeing
 that.


Street's
 not
 seeing
 it
 either.


They
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom


line.
 So,
 this
 is
 actually
 really
 good


to
 see
 TFC
 beat,
 Zion's
 beat.
 I
 mean,
 a


lot
 of
 these
 regional
 banks,
 look
 at
 KRE


back
 to
 60
 bucks.
 This
 thing
 fell
 all


the
 way
 to
 52
 last
 week.
 2.69%
 on
 the


day.
 And
 that
 Zion's
 earnings
 is


probably
 continuing
 to
 help
 the
 momentum


on
 KRE.


So,
 not
 too
 bad
 from


from
 that
 perspective.
 A
 better
 this


stock
 was
 up
 30%
 on
 the
 day.
 Not
 sure


why,
 but
 this
 one
 had
 a
 run.
 Maybe
 a


short
 squeeze,
 maybe
 a
 headline.
 I


didn't
 see
 any
 specific
 headline,
 but


better.
 The
 financing
 company
 for


mortgages,
 that
 was
 up
 30%.
 Rocket


Mortgage,
 that
 stock
 was
 up
 2.6%.
 So,


didn't
 get
 as
 much
 of
 a
 run.
 And
 then


Open
 Door,
 that
 one
 again
 basically
 flat


on
 the
 day
 at
 3%.
 I
 did
 not
 buy
 SoFi.
 I


wanted
 to
 get
 it
 at
 2650.
 Stock
 ran
 away


from
 me.
 So,
 I
 don't
 really
 know
 if
 I'm


going
 to
 buy
 it
 before
 earnings
 now.
 I


thought
 I
 would
 get
 it
 at
 2650
 27,
 but


it's
 up
 8%.
 Maybe
 we'll
 just
 sell
 some


puts
 going
 into
 earnings.
 I
 mean,
 I


really
 don't
 want
 to
 buy
 at
 these


levels.
 So,
 we'll
 see.
 We'll
 see.
 Maybe


it'll
 be
 it'll
 be
 it'll
 be
 a
 game
 time


decision.
 If
 it's
 it's
 kind
 of
 hovering


around
 here,
 maybe
 we
 don't
 buy
 500


shares.
 Maybe
 we
 buy
 a
 couple
 hundred


and
 we
 sell
 some
 puts
 instead.


But,
 we
 got
 to
 see.
 I
 mean,
 we
 got
 a


long
 week.
 We
 might
 get
 some
 dips


throughout
 the
 week
 and
 then
 we'll
 see


how
 we
 operate.
 Pounds,
 right?
 They're


up
 2%.
 Then
 Tesla,
 that's
 up
 1.6%.


as
 well
 on
 this
 day.
 Zillow
 was
 also
 up


2.3.
 So
 you
 saw
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 real


estate
 plays
 even
 with
 that
 10-year


continuing
 to
 come
 down.


Nice.
 Look
 at
 that
 tenure.
 It
 closed


below
 four.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 the
 first


closed
 below
 four
 in
 a
 long
 time
 because


on
 Friday
 it
 was
 below
 four,
 but
 I
 don't


think
 it
 closed
 below
 four.


And
 so
 it's
 nice
 to
 see
 that
 you've
 got


the
 10ear
 down,
 the
 stock
 market
 up.
 I


mean,
 it's
 kind
 of
 creating
 a
 really


good
 scenario.
 The
 only
 other
 weird
 part


about
 this
 is
 gold
 that


doesn't
 seem
 to
 uh
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 slow


down.
 Apploven,
 this
 one
 did
 not
 have


the
 best
 day.
 Continuing
 to
 get
 hit
 by


the
 broader
 markets.
 Look
 at
 that.
 567


down
 5.3%
 of
 the
 day.
 Uh
 some
 new
 update


on
 them.
 Apploven
 is
 under
 federal
 and


state
 data
 privacy
 probes
 after
 short


sellers
 alleged
 it
 tracked
 users


including
 children
 with
 digital


fingerprints
 and
 served
 inappropriate


ads.
 The
 company
 put
 out
 a
 statement


saying
 they
 deny
 the
 claims.


I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 claims
 have
 been


said
 over
 and
 over
 again
 on
 Apploven,


but
 they
 are
 continuing
 to
 get
 attention


based
 on
 this
 SEC
 probe
 and
 that's
 why


that
 stock


is,
 you
 know,
 just
 getting
 that


narrative
 hit
 and
 that's
 why
 it's
 down


about
 5.3%
 on
 the
 day.


So
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 on
 uh
 app.
 All


right,
 some
 of
 the
 other
 headlines
 we


have
 as
 we're
 getting
 into
 this
 market


close.
 So
 let's
 look
 at
 some
 macro


stuff.
 First
 of
 all,
 the
 CBOE,
 which


controls
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 options
 market,


filed
 a
 proposal
 with
 the
 SEC
 today
 to


extend
 options
 trading
 hours,
 adding
 to


a
 pre-market
 session
 from
 7:30
 to
 9:25


and
 a
 short
 postmarket
 session
 from
 4
 to


4:15.


This
 would
 be
 super
 bullish
 Robin
 Hood,


super
 bullish
 Weeble,
 super
 bullish


Fidelity,
 super
 bullish
 Schwab
 if
 people


could
 now
 trade
 options
 15
 minutes
 after


the
 market
 closed
 and
 two
 hours
 before


the
 market
 opens.
 I've
 always
 thought
 I


don't
 understand
 why
 options
 have
 to
 be


so
 tightly
 within
 a
 certain
 area.
 I


mean,
 if
 there's
 liquidity
 at
 7
 a.m.
 you


should
 be
 able
 to
 trade
 your
 option


versus
 having
 to
 wait
 until
 9:30.
 So,
 I


think
 this
 is
 would
 actually
 make
 a
 lot


of
 sense.
 The
 question
 is
 just,
 you


know,
 can
 we,
 you
 know,
 get
 it
 through


the
 SEC?
 But
 in
 this
 SEC,
 they're


accepting
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 proposals.


Potentially,
 we're
 not
 even
 going
 to
 get


quarterly
 earnings
 going
 into
 next
 year


based
 on
 what
 the
 SEC
 says.
 So,
 I
 think


it
 will
 be
 pretty
 bullish
 if
 that
 ends


up
 playing
 out.
 Imagine
 buying
 leaps


during
 earnings.
 Yeah,
 like
 imagine


Tesla
 reports
 at
 4:00
 and
 then
 freaking


the
 stock
 is
 up
 10%
 because
 they
 put
 out


really
 good
 earnings
 and
 you
 could
 just


buy
 leaps
 right
 away
 and
 magnify
 the


returns.
 Now,
 you
 would
 have
 to
 sell
 by


4:15
 or
 you
 would
 have
 to
 sell
 in
 the


morning
 at
 7
 at
 7
 uh,
 you
 know,
 7:15


a.m.
 the
 next
 day,
 but
 still
 it
 would
 be


relatively
 bullish.
 Yeah.
 4:30
 a.m.


options
 for
 the
 West
 Coast.
 Exactly.


Here's
 another
 stat.
 Retail
 continues
 to


buy
 the
 dip.
 Individual
 investors
 have


been
 net
 buyers
 of
 US
 stocks
 in
 the
 last


23
 of
 26
 weeks.
 Last
 week
 marked
 the


seventh
 consecutive
 weekly
 purchase
 in


the
 largest
 in
 five
 months.
 We
 kind
 of


got
 this
 similar
 data
 to
 uh
 from
 from


Bank
 of
 America
 last
 week
 about
 the


largest
 single
 stock
 inflow
 in
 history.


Retail
 investors
 have
 also
 recorded
 24


straight
 weeks
 of
 net
 purchases
 in


equity
 options.
 The
 longest
 streak
 on


record
 in
 data
 going
 back
 to
 2020.
 There


are
 over
 here's
 a
 stat
 that
 I
 didn't


tell
 you
 guys
 in
 the
 morning.
 There
 are


over
 a
 trillion
 dollar
 trillion
 with
 a
 T


in
 zero
 DTE
 options.


I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 this
 money
 is


coming
 from.
 I
 don't
 And
 I
 think


honestly
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 is
 more


hedge
 funds
 that
 are
 hedging
 their
 bets


every
 single
 day
 with
 these
 eod.


But
 if
 a
 certain
 chunk
 of
 that
 trillion


is
 retail,
 then
 it
 just
 goes
 to
 show
 the


popularity


of
 of
 these
 uh
 of
 these
 option


contracts.
 All
 retail
 has
 been
 net


buyers
 of
 ETFs
 in
 206
 of
 the
 last
 28


trading
 days
 so
 far
 in
 2025
 showing
 that


risk
 appetite
 whether
 it's
 for
 ETFs
 or


single
 stocks
 uh
 single
 stock
 inflows
 is


not
 sold
 yet
 and
 it
 is
 quite
 incredible


to
 see
 the
 money
 comes
 from
 the
 money


that
 we
 made
 during
 April
 that's
 fair


but
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 money
 is
 being


essentially
 deployed
 on
 these
 zerod


options
 which
 look
 a
 lot
 of it
 is


gambling
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 might
 also
 be


hedging
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 might
 be
 strategic


but
 I
 mean
 I
 I've
 never
 done
 a
 zero
 DTE


I
 feel
 like
 you
 have
 to
 be
 very
 very


sophisticated
 to
 know
 exactly
 how
 to


navigate
 it.
 The
 fact
 that
 there's
 a


trillion
 dollars
 in
 it
 just
 shows
 that


retail
 investors
 and
 institutional


investors
 do
 like
 the
 product
 and
 it


doesn't
 look
 like
 that
 product
 is


slowing
 down
 anytime
 soon.
 Now
 tariff


revenues
 that
 continues
 to
 break


records.
 US
 tariff
 revenue
 jumped
 22.4


billion
 year
 in
 September
 to
 a
 record


29.7
 billion.
 This
 is
 the
 seventh


consecutive
 monthly
 increase
 following


August
 29.5
 billion
 change.
 So
 far,


year-over-year,
 we
 have
 hit
 195
 billion


for
 fiscal
 year
 2025
 in
 tariffs.
 This
 is


up
 500%
 in
 custom
 duties
 from
 2018.


I
 mean,
 it
 is
 showing
 a
 real
 sign
 that


the
 tariff
 revenue,
 which
 hasn't
 fully


impacted
 inflation
 yet,
 hasn't
 fully
 put


a
 strain
 on
 the
 consumer
 yet.
 Black


Rockck's
 Rick
 Reer
 was
 on
 CNBC
 a
 while


ago.
 I'll
 see
 if
 I
 can
 get
 the
 clip
 of


that
 as
 well.
 And
 he
 thinks
 the
 consumer


is
 in
 one
 of the
 best
 positions
 they've


been
 in.
 And
 he
 also
 thinks
 that
 it's


hard
 to
 fade
 equities
 at
 these
 levels


simply
 based
 on
 the
 idea
 that
 as
 rates


continue
 to
 come
 down
 and
 as
 earnings


continue
 to
 go
 higher.
 I
 mean,
 how
 do


you
 get
 that
 upset
 over
 what's
 going
 on


in
 the
 broader
 markets
 and
 how
 do
 you


stay
 short
 on
 a
 net
 net
 basis?
 Equities


and
 tariffs
 going
 up
 and
 that
 tariff


revenue
 potentially
 helping
 to
 pay
 down


our
 debt.
 If
 we're
 not
 seeing
 the


implications
 of
 that
 meaningfully
 on
 the


consumer
 yet,
 maybe
 we
 will,
 maybe
 we


won't.
 It's
 yet
 to
 be
 seen.
 I
 think
 we


probably
 need
 a
 year's
 worth
 of
 data
 to


make
 that
 conclusion.


That's
 not
 the
 worst
 thing
 in
 the
 world,


which
 is
 a
 better
 argument
 for
 for
 the


bull
 case.


So,
 that's
 what
 we
 have
 there.
 Do
 you


have
 any
 thoughts
 on
 PATH?
 I
 would
 not


buy
 this
 year
 because
 it
 broke
 out


aggressively
 and
 I'm
 not
 sure
 exactly


why
 it
 broke
 out.
 They
 had
 a
 decent


earnings.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 the
 earnings


justified
 as
 big
 of
 a
 move
 as
 they
 made,


but
 if
 you
 understand
 the
 company


fundamentally
 and
 think
 it's
 being


rerated,
 then
 maybe
 it's
 worth
 a
 gamble.


Um,
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 if
 robotic


processing
 automation
 is
 like
 the
 big


thing
 that
 the
 street
 might
 want
 to
 bet


on.


But
 you
 are
 seeing
 some
 people
 get
 more


excited
 about
 that.
 From
 11
 to
 15,
 that


one
 has
 made
 a
 bit
 of
 move.
 By
 the
 way,


we
 didn't
 talk
 about
 this
 in
 the


morning,
 but
 uh,
 Micro
 Strategy
 bought


another
 168
 Bitcoin.


So,
 you
 got
 MSTR


purchasing
 about
 20
 more
 million


of
 Bitcoin.
 Salesforce
 was
 up
 5%
 on
 the


day
 again.
 Ben
 off
 got
 some
 flak
 over


kind
 of
 taking
 back
 his
 comments
 on


Trump
 deploying
 the
 National
 Guard
 after


he
 originally
 said
 they
 should
 do
 it.
 Uh


market
 didn't
 care
 too
 much
 about
 that.


254
 on
 Salesforce
 that's
 up
 4.6%
 on
 the


day.
 Google
 right
 they're
 up
 1.2%.
 And


then
 Tesla
 44685


that
 was
 up
 about
 2%
 on
 the
 day
 as
 well.


Zion
 just
 beat
 earnings
 despite
 a
 50


million
 credit
 loss
 by
 charge.
 That
 is


super
 bullish.
 Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 And
 look,


that's
 another
 reason
 it
 makes
 me


bullish
 for
 SoFi.
 I
 mean,
 you're
 seeing


Zions
 get
 that
 move
 right
 there.
 It's


almost
 like
 the
 regional
 banking
 issue


had
 nothing
 to
 be
 scared
 about,


especially
 if
 they
 beat
 earnings
 even


with
 that
 credit
 charge.
 But
 they
 had
 to


disclose
 that
 credit
 charge
 from
 a
 legal


basis.
 You're
 just
 not
 seeing
 that
 much


pain
 in
 the
 market
 based
 on
 them


them
 uh
 reporting
 those
 numbers.
 Let's


get
 uh
 some
 results
 from
 Zions
 and
 some


coverage.
 This
 is
 what
 we
 had


here
 today.
 541
 estimate
 revenue
 coming


in
 at
 $861
 million
 which
 is
 a
 beat


versus
 the
 $843.1
 million
 estimate
 net


charge
 offs
 were
 56
 million
 most
 of


which
 were
 tied
 to
 that
 $50
 million


charge
 off
 that
 was
 disclosed
 last
 week


tied
 to
 the
 Caner
 group
 and
 apart
 from


that
 loss
 CEO
 Harris
 Simmons
 saying
 that


charge
 offs
 were
 quote
 very
 benign
 at


just
 $6
 million.
 We
 are
 all
 looking


forward
 to
 the
 conference
 call
 at
 5:30


to
 hear
 more
 about
 this
 guys.
 And
 as
 you


said,
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 stock
 is


catching
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 bid
 right


now.


>> Dude,
 56
 million
 in
 charge
 offs
 and
 50


million
 was
 what
 they
 disclosed.
 I
 mean,


that's
 an
 absolute
 nothing
 burner.
 I


would
 not
 be
 surprised
 to
 see
 this
 stock


get
 a
 lot
 more
 momentum
 on
 the
 earnings


call
 when
 the
 CEO
 really
 calms
 people


down.
 That's
 a
 great
 quarter
 for
 the


regionals.
 And
 if
 that
 continues
 going


into
 the
 end
 of
 this
 Q3
 earnings,
 you're


not
 going
 to
 get
 that
 much
 concern


around
 uh
 around
 private
 credit.
 Here's


the
 update
 on
 AWS
 and
 a
 little
 bit
 more


of
 a
 summary
 of
 what
 happened
 today
 with


Amazon
 as
 well.


>> Have
 now
 reported
 problems
 and
 the
 count


is
 still
 rising
 as
 this
 AWS
 outage
 drags


on.
 Now,
 the
 trouble
 stems
 from
 Amazon's


Northern
 Virginia
 region.
 That's
 its


oldest
 and
 busiest
 cloud
 hub,
 still
 the


default
 for
 countless
 apps
 and


platforms.
 This
 is
 the
 same
 data
 center


complex
 that
 Amazon
 has
 leaned
 on
 for


years
 where
 many
 major
 platforms
 first


setup
 shop.
 This
 hub
 has
 seen
 multiple


disruptions
 over
 the
 past
 5
 years.
 Now


AWS
 says
 it
 is
 making
 progress
 fixing


the
 internal
 network
 failures
 that


triggered
 all
 this
 and
 we
 are
 starting


to
 see
 service
 disruptions
 come
 back


down.
 Cyber
 experts
 also
 stressing
 this


is
 not
 a
 hack,
 but
 it
 is
 another


reminder
 of
 the
 risks
 that
 come
 with


centralized
 cloud
 infrastructure.


Despite
 growing
 pressure
 from
 Microsoft


Azure
 and
 Google
 Cloud,
 AWS
 still


controls
 more
 than
 a
 third
 of
 the
 global


market.
 Investor
 sentiment
 was
 already


shaky
 heading
 into
 earnings
 with
 AWS


battling
 margin
 compression
 and
 a


backlog
 trailing
 Microsoft
 and
 Oracle.


This
 outage
 does
 not
 help.
 The
 question


now
 is
 does
 Amazon
 raise
 its
 118
 billion


annual
 capex
 commitment
 next
 week
 to


bulk
 up
 its
 data
 centers,
 expand


compute,
 and
 potentially
 chase
 more
 AI


demand.
 guys.


>> Matt,
 um
 I
 wonder
 there's
 an
 agentic
 AI


challenge
 here,
 it
 seems
 to
 me,
 right?


Because
 we're
 we're
 talking
 about
 AI
 all


the
 time.
 That
 is
 sitting
 on
 top
 of
 the


cloud.
 If
 this
 were
 5
 10
 years
 in
 the


future,
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 people
 to


answer
 the
 phones
 because
 the
 agents
 are


doing
 it
 for
 you
 or
 analyze
 your
 sales


or
 crunch
 your
 numbers,
 does
 a
 cloud


outage
 become
 a
 work
 stoppage
 for


companies?
 I
 mean,
 it
 seems
 like
 the


stakes
 are
 only
 getting
 higher
 for
 the


economy
 as
 we
 rely
 more
 and
 more
 on


these
 resources.


>> I
 mean,
 today
 laid
 bare
 the
 fact
 that


Perplexity
 doesn't
 have
 a
 robust
 enough


multicloud
 strategy.
 I'm
 out
 to


Anthropic
 to
 hear
 whether
 they've


suffered
 disruption,
 but
 we
 haven't
 seen


reports
 of
 that.
 And
 that's
 because
 they


rely
 on
 a
 mix
 of
 cloud
 providers,
 not


just
 Amazon,
 but
 Google
 Cloud.
 We
 also


saw
 OpenAI
 diversify
 away
 from
 just


working
 with
 Microsoft
 Azure.
 They're
 a


Google
 Cloud
 customer
 as
 well
 to
 prevent


exactly
 this.
 John,
 you
 can't
 have


reliance
 on
 one
 single
 provider
 anymore.


>> So,
 in
 light
 of
 that,
 Mac,
 who
 are
 the


potential
 winners,
 if
 there
 are
 some


coming
 off
 of
 this
 event,


>> I
 mean,
 think
 about
 Oracle's
 investor


day
 last
 week.
 Their
 backlog
 number,
 I'm


looking
 at
 a
 chart
 of
 this,
 it's
 up
 to


$455
 billion.
 Azures,
 $368
 billion.
 You


know
 where
 Amazon
 is?
 It's
 shy
 of
 $200


billion.
 And
 that's
 a
 big
 concern
 here.


Yes,
 they
 are
 still
 the
 firm
 leader
 in


the
 cloud
 wars,
 but
 their
 growth
 numbers


year-over-year
 are
 coming
 down.
 we


seeing
 we're
 seeing
 those


>> and
 that's
 why
 the
 stock
 has
 been
 hit.
 I


mean,
 look,
 it's
 really
 this
 simple
 for


Amazon.
 If
 they
 can
 get
 that
 RPO,


remaining
 performance
 obligations
 or


their
 backlog


to
 be
 similar
 to
 Oracle,


which
 again,
 it's
 not
 even
 revenue,
 but


Oracle
 got
 that
 juicy
 OpenAI
 $300


billion
 contract
 and
 then
 their
 RPO
 went


from
 150
 billion
 to$450
 billion.
 Boom.


The
 stock
 goes
 up
 200
 billion
 in
 market


cap.
 If
 I
 mean,
 Amazon's
 probably
 not


getting
 uh
 OpenAI.
 I
 mean,
 they
 probably


would
 have
 got
 them
 by
 now
 if
 they
 were


in
 the
 running
 for
 like
 a
 meaningful


part
 of
 their
 workload.
 But
 if
 they
 can


get
 some
 acceleration,
 they
 don't
 need


500
 billion
 in
 backlog.
 They
 need
 like


another
 10,
 20,
 30
 billion
 to
 get
 the


street
 to
 see
 the
 the
 potential
 of
 their


ability
 to
 expand
 AWS
 even
 at
 the
 scale


that
 they're
 operating
 at.
 That
 would


get
 the
 stock
 to
 rerate.
 If
 that
 doesn't


happen
 on
 earnings,
 as
 as
 much
 as
 I
 like


Amazon,
 as
 much
 as
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 buy


the
 dip
 and
 hold
 for
 the
 next
 10
 years,


this
 stock's
 going
 below
 200.
 I
 mean,


and and
 I
 think
 everyone
 should
 be


prepared
 for
 that.
 You
 should
 not
 expect


a
 rerating
 on
 Amazon
 on
 earnings
 if
 AWS


does
 not
 accelerate
 because
 they're
 not


going to
 get
 margin
 from
 the
 commerce


business.
 Maybe
 advertising
 a
 aids
 a


little
 bit
 on
 their
 operating
 income.


But
 AWS
 is
 a
 story
 right
 here.
 And


they've
 either
 got
 to
 make
 it
 more


efficient,
 aka
 better
 than
 36%
 operating


margins,
 uh,
 or
 they've
 got
 to
 increase


the
 volume.
 And
 right
 now
 the
 street's


been
 very
 receptive
 to
 seeing
 the


increase
 of
 volume
 because
 it
 shows
 that


AI
 companies
 are
 choosing
 to
 work
 with


certain
 cloud
 providers
 like
 an
 Oracle,


Google
 and
 Microsoft.
 If
 Amazon
 can't
 do


that,
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 stock
 has
 a


good
 earnings
 just
 to
 be
 quite
 quite


frank.
 If
 they
 do,
 I
 think
 it's
 headed


closer
 to
 250.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 the


gamble
 that
 you
 have
 to
 take
 on
 Amazon


if
 you
 are
 if
 you
 are
 in
 the
 name
 after


today.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 they
 can
 scale


the
 AWS
 business.
 I
 think
 today
 is
 going


to
 be
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where
 they


have
 to
 apologize
 to
 some
 of
 their


trusted
 customers,
 but
 it's
 not
 a
 death


blow
 for
 Amazon,
 just
 like
 Crowd


Strike's
 July
 incident
 in
 2024
 wasn't
 a


death
 blow
 for
 Crowdstrike
 either.
 I


mean,
 Crowd
 Strike
 took
 a
 $60
 million


hit
 in
 credits
 and
 that
 was
 it.
 You
 had


people
 saying
 this
 company
 was
 bankrupt.


It
 was
 over.
 It
 was
 done.
 Like,
 and
 the


only
 regret
 I
 have
 is
 I
 didn't
 buy
 more.


I
 I
 re
 like
 I
 just
 I
 you
 know
 I
 bought


at
 330
 and
 then
 I
 bought
 again
 at
 250


didn't
 hold
 on
 to
 it
 for
 the
 long
 term


but
 like
 it
 was
 a
 nothing
 burger.
 I
 mean


it
 was
 a
 something
 burger
 but
 it
 was
 a


nothing
 burger
 in
 the
 context
 of
 the


company
 being
 dead
 because
 CrowdStrike


is
 the
 leader
 in
 endpoint
 security.


Amazon
 is
 one
 of
 three
 companies
 that


runs
 the
 entire
 internet
 and
 that
 was


pretty
 evident
 today
 and
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 that
 easy
 for
 a
 company
 to
 be
 like


oh
 yeah
 we're
 just
 going
 to
 leave
 Amazon


tomorrow
 and
 go
 to
 Microsoft.
 Like
 it's


not
 that
 simple.


And
 so
 as
 a
 result,
 I
 don't
 think
 this


one
 gets
 hit
 as
 bad.
 Yeah,
 a
 lot
 of
 them


are
 just
 way
 too
 deep
 into
 this
 uh


infrastructure
 of
 OS.


Um,


okay,
 let's
 see
 some
 of
 the
 other


headlines
 that
 we've
 got
 going
 on
 here.


AMD
 again
 closed
 at
 240.
 Twitch
 is


horrible.
 I
 agree.
 Look,
 Amazon
 needs
 to


get
 rid
 of
 Twitch.
 Twitch
 is
 just
 a


money
 pit.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 they're


doing
 with
 Twitch.
 They've
 had
 it
 for


like
 10
 years
 and
 they
 haven't
 been
 able


to
 do
 anything
 with
 it.
 So,
 I
 wouldn't


mind
 them
 selling
 that
 off,
 but
 you


know,
 maybe
 if
 they
 can
 monetize
 better,


that
 would
 be
 more
 bullish
 for
 them.
 Uh,


Coree.
 So,
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 Steve
 about


Core
 Weef
 today.
 He's
 started
 to
 do
 a


lot
 more
 due
 diligence
 and
 is
 getting


way
 more
 bullish
 on
 the
 product.
 Here's


the
 here's
 the
 punch
 line
 on
 Core
 Weef.


30
 billion
 in
 backlogs,
 three
 billion
 in


revenues.


It's
 hard
 to
 be
 super
 bearish,
 dude.


Like,
 maybe
 the
 valuation
 isn't
 the
 most


attractive,
 but
 30
 billion
 in
 backlog,


three
 billion
 in
 in
 sales.
 And
 and
 not


to
 mention
 Nvidia
 has
 a
 $6.3
 billion
 put


option
 where
 they
 will
 buy
 $6
 billion


worth
 of
 unused
 GPUs
 just
 in
 case


Cororee
 can't
 find
 a
 customer.
 That's


how
 confident
 Nvidia
 is
 in
 the
 fact
 that


Corore
 will
 find
 a
 customer.


I
 don't
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 I
 haven't
 done
 a


lot
 of
 fundamental
 due
 diligence
 on


Core,
 but
 that
 would
 be
 the
 reason
 to


get
 excited
 about
 it.
 And
 you
 know


that's
 similar
 to
 what
 the
 Nebus
 blows


get
 excited
 about
 is
 that
 that
 backlog


will
 eventually
 increase
 with
 Nebus
 as


well
 as
 they
 get
 more
 of
 these


hyperscaler
 deals
 that
 core
 is
 able
 to


get
 with
 uh
 with
 Meta
 and
 with
 OpenAI


for
 Nebus
 it's
 primarily
 with
 Microsoft


yeah
 core
 is
 basically
 90%
 of
 Nvidia's


portfolio
 I
 mean
 Nvidia
 has
 a
 vested


interest
 to
 make
 sure
 Coree
 doesn't
 fail


however
 they
 do
 have a
 lot
 of
 debt
 and


so
 that's
 you
 know
 those
 are
 the
 sort
 of


nuances
 you
 have
 to
 navigate
 with
 a


stock
 like
 that
 right
 they're
 up
 2.7%


STS
 basically
 was
 flat
 on
 the
 day.
 That


one
 didn't
 move
 too
 much.
 Microsoft,


you're
 still
 below
 300.
 You
 are
 not


seeing
 the
 Bitcoin
 bulls
 get
 super


excited
 about
 MSTR
 yet,


but
 that
 one
 continues
 uh
 to
 stay
 in


that
 300
 range.
 Upstart
 has
 short


interest
 of
 30%,
 it
 was
 up
 9%
 today.


Upstart
 was
 the
 original
 stock
 that
 had


some
 issues
 last
 week
 or
 two
 weeks
 ago


with
 the
 delinquency
 reports
 that
 turned


out
 to
 not
 necessarily
 be
 correct.
 So,


their
 earnings
 will
 be
 also
 very


important.
 Yeah,
 Upstart.
 Wow,
 30%


shorted.


So
 is
 at
 8%.


So
 that
 is
 definitely
 another
 one


to
 watch
 out
 for
 as
 well.


Uh
 when's
 Corey
 earnings?
 I
 believe
 it's


in
 two
 weeks.
 I
 believe
 it's
 in
 two


weeks
 and
 then
 we'll
 see.


We'll
 see
 what
 Corey
 has
 to
 say.
 Uh


Apple,
 let's
 hear
 some
 analysis
 on


Apple.
 This
 is
 another
 analyst
 named


Emit.
 Um,


I
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 will
 eventually
 look


like
 this
 guy.
 I
 mean,
 all
 people
 lose


their
 hair
 at
 one
 point.
 Hopefully,
 it's


not
 until
 I'm
 much
 older.
 But
 here
 is


Amit
 Darani's
 perspective
 on
 Apple.


>> Uh,
 you
 know,
 so
 far,
 yes,
 it's
 I
 think


it's
 about
 two
 things
 in
 advance.
 The


iPhone
 cycle,
 iPhone
 17's
 doing
 fairly


well.
 And
 what's
 interesting
 is
 in


different
 countries,
 the
 different


things
 that
 are
 resonating.
 In
 China,


for example,
 I
 think
 the
 base
 models
 are


doing
 much
 better.
 In
 the
 US,
 the
 Pro


Max
 models
 are
 doing
 well.
 And
 I
 think


it's
 a
 combination
 of
 you
 just
 have


older
 iPhones,
 you
 have
 this
 big
 swath


of
 phones
 that
 have been
 purchased
 in


2020,
 2021,
 the
 pandemic
 time,
 they're


just
 up
 for
 upgrades
 right
 now.
 U


there's
 a
 good
 amount
 of
 innovation


these
 phones
 and
 in
 the
 US
 at
 least,
 the


promotions
 are
 fairly
 attractive.
 So
 I


think
 there's
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 that
 are


working
 out
 in
 their
 favor
 that's
 giving


you
 better
 iPhone
 momentum.
 At
 the
 same


time,
 all
 the
 headaches
 and
 worries


people
 had
 on
 services,
 either
 the
 DOJ


versus
 Google
 lawsuit
 or
 what
 could


happen
 with
 Apple
 versus
 Epic
 have
 sort


of
 all
 gone
 away.
 So,
 I
 think
 it's


almost
 a
 perfect
 storm
 in
 a
 positive


manner
 for
 Apple
 stock
 right
 now.


>> So,
 you
 do


>> I
 I
 think
 he's
 right,
 dude.
 It's
 a


perfect
 storm
 for
 Apple.
 iPhone
 17
 up


way
 better
 than
 expected.
 Everyone's


excited
 about
 what
 Apple
 could


potentially
 do
 with
 a
 real
 agentic
 Siri


going
 into
 2026.
 And
 here's
 the
 most


important
 thing.
 Apple
 um
 they
 don't


really
 pay
 that
 much
 in
 capex,


right?
 Like
 they
 they
 don't
 have
 massive


capex
 investments.
 They
 spend
 a
 lot
 of


their
 money
 on
 buying
 back
 the
 stock


which
 continues
 to
 lift
 the
 share
 price,


but
 they're
 not
 spending
 it
 on
 tons
 and


tons
 of
 GPUs.
 They're
 just
 going
 to


partner
 with
 the
 Gemini
 or
 with
 the


CHABT,
 let
 them
 do
 all
 the
 capex


spending
 and
 just
 integrate
 the
 software


into
 their
 distribution.


And
 I
 think
 that
 is
 actually
 the
 very


exciting
 thing
 about
 Apple.
 We
 do
 have


this
 in
 the
 stock
 draft.
 Let's
 take
 an


update
 on
 that.
 Matt
 is
 up
 48%.


I'm
 at
 37.
 Apple
 gave
 us
 a
 nice
 Yeah,


32%.
 Can't
 be
 too
 mad
 about
 that.


198
 to
 262.
 Steve's
 up
 8%.
 Tanner's
 up


21.7.
 Chris
 is
 up
 10.4.
 And
 then
 you
 got


Matt
 right
 there
 at
 48%.


That's
 a
 mit
 in
 a
 bare
 market.
 That's
 a


mid
 if
 Palenter
 crashes.
 Oh
 my
 gosh,


dude.


That's
 a
 mid
 if
 he
 keeps
 eating
 rare


steaks.
 Dude,
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 I'm


not
 tripping,
 right?
 This
 thing
 is
 not


medium.


This
 thing
 is
 not
 freaking
 medium.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 pink
 in
 that.


It's
 not
 medium,
 bro.
 That's
 rare.
 I


think
 I
 legit
 had
 rare
 steak
 today.


Legit
 had
 a
 rare
 steak
 today.
 Uh


anthropic
 CEO.
 This
 guy
 thinks
 that
 they


are
 growing
 faster
 than
 everybody.
 I


think
 he's
 right
 about
 that.
 Here's
 what


he
 had
 to
 say
 as
 well
 about
 anthropics


growth


>> is
 is
 that
 there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 an


enormous
 need
 for
 compute
 for
 for
 all


the
 reasons
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 that
 that


we've
 laid
 out
 right
 the
 the
 scaling


laws
 suggest
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 need


more
 and
 more
 compute
 to
 train
 smarter


and
 smarter
 models
 and
 then
 as
 the


revenue
 goes
 up
 we're
 going
 to
 we're
 you


know
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 to
 serve
 more


we're
 going
 to
 need
 to
 serve
 more
 of
 our


models.
 So
 when
 that
 revenue
 is
 not
 7


billion
 but
 a h
 100red
 billion
 or
 more


um
 uh
 and
 you
 know
 when
 when
 model


training
 requires
 millions
 of
 chips
 you


know
 we're
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 many
 many


gigawatts
 of
 power
 to
 to
 train
 the


models.
 So
 we're
 trying
 to
 secure
 that


power
 basically
 wherever
 we
 can
 um
 you


know
 and
 I'm
 confident
 in
 the
 company's


uh
 uh
 I'm
 confident
 in
 the
 company's


ability
 to
 do
 so.
 I
 I
 I
 do
 get
 a
 bit


worried
 when
 the
 press
 focuses
 too
 much


on
 the
 building
 of
 the
 data
 centers
 and


deals
 to
 build
 data
 centers.
 Some
 of


these
 deals
 seem
 a
 little
 bit
 fishy.


They
 seem
 like
 there
 may
 be
 double


counting.
 And
 I
 I
 also
 worry
 again


>> deals
 are
 you
 ask
 talking
 about?


>> I
 mean
 that's
 pretty
 incredible.
 That's


basically
 him
 saying
 all
 these
 data


center
 companies
 that
 are
 I
 mean


implicitly
 he's
 saying
 these
 stocks
 that


are
 going
 up
 based
 on
 these
 hyperscaler


deals
 might
 not
 be
 as
 legit
 as
 they


seem.
 Now
 granted
 you
 got
 to
 take
 that


with
 a
 grain
 of
 salt.
 You
 don't
 know


what
 his
 intentions
 are
 or
 motives
 are


to
 say
 this
 type
 of
 stuff
 but
 he's


trying
 to
 say
 the
 foundation
 models
 are


what
 matter
 not
 the
 data
 center
 deals.


And
 maybe
 people
 are
 putting
 too
 much


attention
 on
 the
 data
 centers


themselves.


>> I
 don't
 know
 what
 you're
 talking
 about.


I
 have
 no
 idea.
 Um
 uh
 uh
 uh


>> who
 is
 double
 counting?
 These
 are
 all


public
 companies.
 I


>> I
 I


>> We're
 going
 to
 want
 to
 know
 who's
 double


counting.


>> I
 don't
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't


know
 anything
 more
 than
 you.


>> What
 about
 the
 ones
 who
 are
 doing
 triple


counting?


>> I
 I
 don't
 There
 might
 be
 some
 of
 that,


too.


>> Wow.
 All
 right.


>> I
 don't
 know.
 Um
 uh
 uh
 uh
 but
 but
 but


look
 look look
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


all
 this
 data
 center
 stuff
 is
 spending


money,
 right?
 Um
 I
 think
 the
 thing


that's
 most
 important
 is
 making
 money.


Um
 and
 and
 so
 this
 is
 why
 I
 focus
 on
 you


know
 the
 revenue
 and
 the
 actual
 work


that
 we're
 doing
 with
 businesses.


Enthropic
 is
 growing
 faster
 than
 any


other
 company
 in
 the
 space.
 The
 revenue


is
 growing
 faster
 and
 you
 know
 I
 think
 I


think
 basically
 if
 if
 you
 know
 if
 the
 if


the
 demand
 is
 there
 if
 customers
 want


the
 money
 and
 they're
 willing
 to
 pay
 you


then
 you
 are
 willing
 to
 pay
 your
 compute


providers
 and
 you'll
 get
 the
 compute
 you


need
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.


>> He's
 not
 wrong
 by
 the
 way.
 Anthropic
 is


growing
 faster.
 They
 were
 doing
 1


billion
 in
 revenue
 at
 the
 beginning
 of


2026.
 That
 went
 to
 5
 billion
 in
 July.


Now
 it's
 8
 billion
 for
 the
 estimate
 in


of
 September
 of
 2025
 with
 an
 estimate


base
 case
 of
 20
 billion
 for
 next
 year,


which
 would
 be
 8
 to
 20
 with
 a
 bull
 case


of
 26
 billion.
 So
 that
 would
 be
 more


than
 a
 3x
 in
 revenue,
 300%


year-over-year
 growth.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 the


rumors
 are
 OpenAI
 is
 doing
 20
 billion


right
 now.
 Some
 people
 say
 they're
 doing


14
 billion.
 So
 Open
 AI
 is
 probably
 going


to
 be
 in
 the
 same
 ballpark.
 anthropics


going
 like
 in
 fact
 I
 I
 just
 I
 mean
 it's


it's
 timely
 we're
 talking
 about
 this.
 I


just
 got
 a
 $20
 a
 month
 subscription
 to


Claude.


I've
 been
 using
 Claude
 more
 and
 more,


bro.
 I
 mean
 it's
 honestly
 I'm
 not
 going


to
 lie.
 It's
 I'm
 liking
 it.
 Grock
 takes


too
 long.
 It
 takes
 too
 long.
 I
 I'm


starting
 to
 get
 annoyed
 by
 it.
 I'm
 like,


bro,
 you're
 taking
 way
 too
 long
 to
 give


me
 an
 answer.
 Anthropic
 is
 quicker
 and


it's
 just
 like
 it's
 like
 I
 I
 signed
 up


for
 Claude
 last
 week
 and
 I've
 been


starting
 to
 use
 it
 more.
 Like,
 dude,


this
 is
 this
 is
 actually
 a
 bit
 better


than
 Glock
 Glock
 than
 Grock
 and
 I
 pay


for
 Grock
 because
 I
 pay
 for
 Twitter


premium.


So,
 yeah,
 it's
 slow,
 right?
 Okay.
 So,


it's
 not
 just
 me,
 right?
 Like,
 Grock
 is


starting
 to
 get
 slow
 and
 I'm
 like,
 this


is
 such
 a
 first
 world
 problems
 100%.
 But


I'm
 like,
 bro,
 like
 if
 I'm
 paying
 50


bucks
 a
 month,
 I
 want
 the
 answers


immediately.
 This
 [ __ ]
 is
 thinking
 for


hours.
 I
 didn't
 ask
 you
 that
 hard
 of
 a


question.
 Like,
 give
 me
 the
 answer.
 I


thought
 you
 were
 connected
 to
 Twitter.


Shouldn't
 you
 have
 all
 the
 data?
 And


then
 anthropic
 is
 like
 instant.


So,


oh
 yeah,
 I'm
 I'm
 This
 is
 music
 to


Tanner's
 ears.
 Tanner
 absolutely
 hates


Grock.
 And
 uh
 he
 he
 posted
 a
 tweet
 of


how
 how
 crappy
 Grock
 has
 been
 for
 him.


And
 and
 dude,
 I
 have
 no
 desire
 to
 hate


on
 Grock.
 I
 mean,
 I
 literally
 pay
 for


Twitter
 premium.
 I
 want
 it
 to
 work,
 but


but
 it's
 just
 kind
 of
 been
 sucking
 for


me.
 And
 so
 Tanner
 said,
 "Grock
 is
 so


unbelievably
 ma
 bad.
 It's
 mind-blowing.


It
 doesn't
 even
 know
 who
 I
 am.
 It


doesn't
 source
 any
 context
 from
 our


previous
 conversations.
 It
 can't
 even


make
 a
 funny
 image
 to
 reply
 to
 comments.


I
 paid
 for
 Super
 Grock
 with
 a
 full


annual
 subscription
 and
 find
 myself
 on


the
 free
 versions
 of
 Gemini
 and
 Chatbt


more.
 And
 I
 am
 on
 here
 listening
 to
 Elon


say
 AGI
 is
 close.
 Figure
 out
 the
 memes


first.
 Tanner
 said,
 "Can
 you
 make
 an


image
 of
 Anthony
 Notto
 the
 CEO
 of
 SoFi


saying,
 "Why
 do
 you
 need
 other
 bank


accounts?"
 Yeah,
 this
 is
 not
 even
 close.


This
 is
 not
 even
 close,
 bro.


And
 look,
 Elon
 said
 that
 there
 is
 a
 10%


chance
 Gro
 5
 will
 achieve
 AGI.


I
 mean,


I
 don't
 know,
 maybe
 Grock
 5
 will,
 but


Grock
 4
 definitely
 is
 not
 not
 getting
 it


yet.


So,
 I
 moved
 on
 and
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 it


goes
 to
 show
 the
 the
 the
 the
 uh
 the
 um


fragility
 of
 consumers,
 right?
 How
 quick


they
 are
 to
 switch.
 Like,
 I
 was
 actually


wrong
 about
 this
 assumption.
 I
 said,
 I


think
 a
 couple
 months
 ago,
 that
 that


Chachi
 PBT's
 first
 mover
 advantage
 would


make
 it
 very
 hard
 for
 for
 uh
 freaking


Gemini
 to
 compete
 and
 now
 I'm
 like


because
 like
 they
 have
 all
 the
 users,


but
 it's
 like
 wait
 a
 second,
 if
 Gemini


is
 better,
 then
 people
 will
 switch.


People
 won't
 care,
 dude.
 As
 long
 as
 it


works,
 people
 are
 ready
 to
 use
 something


else.
 And
 I'm
 using
 Clawude
 more
 now


than
 Grock
 because
 it
 works
 better.
 And


so
 I
 I
 guess
 maybe
 I'm
 I
 don't
 think
 I'm


as
 accurate
 on
 this
 whole
 first
 mover


advantage
 stuff
 versus
 quality
 of
 usage.


Then
 Tanner
 said,
 "What
 do
 I
 do
 for
 a


living?"
 Based
 on
 your
 ex
 profile,
 Lori,


you
 work
 as
 a
 pro
 bono
 attorney
 helping


folks
 who
 can't
 afford
 legal


representation,
 which
 sounds
 like
 a


noble
 gig.


Tanner
 said,
 "My
 ex-profile
 is
 future


investing."


Tanner,
 I
 didn't
 know
 you
 were
 a
 pro


bono
 attorney,
 bud.
 And
 this
 is
 really


sad
 on
 Grock
 because
 it
 literally
 has


access
 to
 your
 profile.
 And
 if
 it
 can't


read
 your
 profile,
 like
 like
 what
 are
 we


talking
 about?
 AGI.
 I
 mean,
 if
 it
 cannot


read
 who
 you
 are
 connected
 to
 your
 I


mean,
 Chachi
 doesn't
 have
 access
 to
 your


Twitter
 profile
 like
 that.
 So,
 I
 don't


know.
 Not
 the
 best
 look
 for
 Grock.


But,
 nonetheless,
 a
 lot
 of these
 LM


continue
 to
 grow.
 One
 thing
 we
 haven't


heard
 from
 Elon,
 I'll
 do
 a
 poll
 in
 the


chat
 for
 which
 LLM
 people
 use
 is
 the


growth
 rate
 on
 Grock.
 We've
 heard
 Chat


GBTS
 from
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 rumors.


We've
 heard
 anthropics
 just
 now.
 Uh
 we


have
 not
 really
 heard
 Grock's
 growth


rate
 and
 Elon
 hasn't
 disclosed
 it.
 And


maybe
 because
 it's
 not
 as
 good
 as
 people


think
 and
 if
 it's
 not
 then
 the
 question


is,
 you
 know,
 how
 does
 XAI
 meaningfully


compete
 to
 get
 people
 away
 from
 the


other
 platforms?
 We
 know
 Gemini
 is
 at


450
 monthly
 and
 that
 was
 that
 was
 90


days
 ago.
 that
 might,
 you
 know,
 turn


into
 600
 to
 700
 going
 into
 this
 Q3


report.
 Which
 LLM
 do
 you
 use
 daily?
 We


have
 GPT,
 we
 have
 Grock,
 we
 have
 Claude,


then
 what's
 the
 other
 one?


Llama,
 I
 guess,
 or
 other.
 We'll
 say


other.
 GPT,
 Grock,
 Claude.
 Oh,
 no.


Gemini.
 Gemini.
 It's
 Gemini.


Okay.
 Which
 one
 of
 those
 do
 people
 use?


I'm
 seeing
 some
 decent
 amount
 of


Perplexities,
 bro.
 You
 know,


Perplexity's
 Comet,
 I
 used
 it
 for
 a
 task


the
 other
 day
 and
 it
 actually
 really
 did


a
 good
 job.
 Like
 I
 I
 logged
 on
 to
 Robin


Hood
 on
 Perplexity's
 comment
 browser
 and


I
 told
 the
 the
 agent
 to
 like
 calculate


something
 for
 me
 based
 on
 the
 page
 I
 was


on
 and
 it
 it
 did
 a
 really
 good
 job
 and
 I


was
 like,
 "Oh,
 that
 was
 that
 was


actually
 kind
 of
 that
 that's
 a
 use
 case


because
 there's
 always
 questions
 I
 have


about
 certain
 positions
 I'm
 in
 on
 Robin


Hood."
 But
 it
 it's
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 adding


and
 subtracting
 and
 I'm
 like, "Dude,
 can


I
 just
 like
 ask
 some
 like
 Robin
 Hood


should
 come
 out
 with
 an
 LLM
 where
 you


can
 ask
 it
 questions
 about
 your


positions?"


Be
 like,
 "Hey,
 Robin
 Hood,
 I'm
 in
 these


seven
 covered
 calls.
 I'm
 curious
 about


XYZ
 blah
 blah
 blah
 like
 that.
 That


should
 be
 so
 intuitive.
 And
 maybe
 with


their
 Cortex
 product,
 we're
 going
 to
 see


that
 in
 next
 year.
 But
 I
 did
 have
 ear


proxy
 and
 it
 was
 pretty
 damn
 good.


So,
 you
 know,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see


how
 old
 these
 eventually


evolve
 long
 term.
 Um,
 results
 on
 this


poll.
 Let
 me
 see.
 Wow.
 43%
 say
 chat
 GPT,


32%
 say
 Gemini,
 only
 5%
 say
 Claude.


Google
 Pro
 can
 do
 the
 same
 thing.
 Yes,
 I


don't
 pay
 for
 Google
 Pro.
 Uh,
 I've
 never


tried
 it.
 I
 would
 be
 open
 to
 definitely


trying
 it,
 especially
 because
 I
 use


Google
 all
 day,
 but
 I
 would
 imagine
 they


can
 do
 things
 that
 are
 very
 I
 I
 someone


invited
 me
 to
 to
 to
 Perplexity,
 so
 I
 got


it
 for
 free.
 That's
 why
 I
 used
 it.


But
 overall,
 we
 are
 seeing
 a
 lot
 more


potential
 innovation
 in
 the
 space
 as


this
 stuff
 tends
 to
 tends
 to
 ramp
 up.


So,
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 there.
 Google
 Pro


is
 free
 for
 one
 year
 for
 students.
 Dude,


I
 think
 all
 of
 these
 LLMs
 should
 just


give
 as
 much
 of
 their
 usage
 as
 they
 can


for
 free.


It
 would
 be
 so
 smart.
 I
 remember
 I
 got


Spotify
 for
 like
 $5
 a
 year
 back
 when
 I


was
 in
 college.
 It
 was
 a
 no-brainer.


It's
 like,
 yeah,
 five,
 no,
 sorry,
 $5
 a


month.
 It's
 like
 five
 bucks
 a
 month
 in


college
 is
 affordable.
 And
 uh
 and
 then


they
 had
 me
 hooked,
 but
 then
 I
 left
 to


YouTube
 Music
 when
 YouTube
 Premium


offered
 the
 bundle.
 But
 like
 it's
 so


easy
 to
 get
 college
 kids
 to
 use


something
 if
 you
 make
 it
 free
 and
 then


they
 kind
 of
 just
 stay
 for
 for
 a
 long


time.
 And
 college
 kids,
 you
 know,
 have
 a


lot
 of
 use
 cases
 in
 regards
 to
 using


these
 data
 centers
 as
 well.


Um,
 did
 you
 get
 Claude
 to
 support
 the


Amazon
 investment?
 No,
 I
 just
 started


using
 it.
 Like
 I
 literally
 logged
 on


last
 week
 and
 I
 was
 like
 because
 Grock


was
 being
 stupid.
 I
 don't
 pay
 for
 GPT.


And
 so
 I
 was
 like
 let
 me
 let
 me
 ask


Claude
 some
 questions.
 I've
 heard
 about


it.
 You
 know,
 I
 hear
 Dario
 all
 the
 time


talking
 about
 how
 fast
 they
 were.


cousin,
 she
 works
 at
 a
 tech
 company.
 She


can't
 stop
 talking
 about
 it.
 So,
 I
 was


like, "Let
 me
 try
 it
 out."
 And
 then
 I'm


like, "Bro,
 this
 is
 way
 better
 than
 what


I've
 been
 using
 in
 Brock,
 and
 it's
 way


faster."
 And
 so,
 I'm
 like, "All
 right,


this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 new
 daily
 driver,


and
 now
 I
 pay
 for
 it."


And
 so,
 the
 question
 just
 becomes,
 how


much
 can
 that
 conversion
 continue
 to
 get


more
 and
 more
 people
 to
 be
 excited
 about


about
 the
 service?
 Um,
 all right.
 What


other
 headlines
 do
 we
 have
 on
 the
 day?


We
 talked
 about
 the
 hasset
 comments
 in


the
 morning
 about
 the
 shutdown


potentially
 coming
 to
 a


an
 end.
 Oh
 wow.
 Poly
 market
 has
 unveiled


15minute
 increment
 crypto
 betting


powered
 by
 chain
 link


15minute
 polyarks.
 Bro,
 this
 is
 the
 most


degenerate
 thing
 I've
 ever
 seen.
 You
 can


bet
 within
 15
 minutes
 this
 the
 price
 of


Bitcoin


up
 or
 down.


This
 came
 out
 three
 hours
 ago.
 I
 feel


like
 this
 is
 a
 way
 bigger
 announcement


than
 we're
 giving
 it
 credit
 for.


15minute
 incremental
 poly
 markets.


Yeah,
 you
 might
 as
 well
 flip
 a
 coin,


bro.


[Music]


That
 is
 crazy.


Okay,
 I
 guess
 that's
 I
 mean
 I
 imagine


Khi
 will
 be
 next.


I
 imagine
 Kali
 will
 be
 next.


I
 can't
 play
 the
 audio.
 They're
 playing


a
 Drake
 song.
 It's
 gonna
 it's
 going
 to


get
 the
 copyright.
 But
 uh
 Okay.
 So,
 we


have
 15
 Minute
 Poly
 Markets.
 That's
 a


new
 headline
 to
 me.
 I'm
 just
 seeing
 that


right
 now.
 This
 headline
 I
 talked
 about


on
 the
 future
 show
 yesterday.
 I
 didn't


share
 on
 the
 market
 open,
 but
 uh
 for


those
 that
 missed
 it,
 Chamath,


Donald
 Trump
 Jr.,
 and
 Lauren
 Ingram
 are


launching
 a
 new
 spa.


That
 is
 an
 accurate
 headline.
 Lauren


Ingram
 hosts
 Fox
 News,
 the
 Ingram
 angle.


Don
 Jr.
 is
 the
 president's
 son,
 and


Chimath
 is
 the
 spa
 king.
 The
 uh
 the


freaking
 spa
 is
 called
 Colombia


Acquisition
 Corp.
 and
 it's
 registered
 in


none
 other
 than
 the
 Cayman
 Islands.


Again,


not
 the
 best
 look
 for
 those
 claiming


that
 it's
 not
 a
 top,
 but
 this
 is
 uh
 some


of
 the
 stuff
 we've
 got
 going
 on.
 I
 have


rationalized
 it
 the
 same
 way
 I've
 talked


about
 over
 the
 ca
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 If


this
 thing
 goes
 to
 10
 billion
 and
 then


goes
 to
 zero,
 who
 cares?
 Just
 like
 an


Oaklow,
 just
 like
 one
 of
 these
 quantum


stocks,
 like
 it's
 just
 not
 affecting
 the


broader
 S&P
 500.


But
 it
 does
 mean
 there's
 a
 lot
 more


liquidity
 in
 the
 system
 for
 these
 guys


to
 be
 deciding
 to
 launch
 a
 spa.


And
 that's
 what
 you've
 got
 going
 on


right
 here.
 So
 there
 you
 go.
 We
 have
 no


idea
 what
 the
 ticker
 is
 going to
 be.
 We


have
 no
 idea
 what
 the
 company
 is
 going


to
 be.
 It
 was
 announced
 October
 17th.


The
 8K
 came
 out.
 So
 literally
 a
 couple


days
 ago.


And


you
 know,
 we'll
 see
 if
 it
 turns
 into


something
 that
 retail
 would
 buy.
 I
 tried


command
 fing
 casino
 on
 the
 SEC
 filing


because
 Chimat's
 other
 spa
 says
 you


can't
 cry
 in
 the
 casino.
 There
 was
 no


warning
 about
 not
 crying
 in
 the
 casino.


So,


I
 mean,
 maybe
 this
 will
 end
 up
 becoming


a
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 casino
 when
 it
 ends
 up


when
 it
 ends
 up
 coming
 out.
 Uh,
 some


other
 updates
 from
 the
 Trump
 meeting.
 We


talked
 about
 the
 China
 stuff.
 Here
 is


what
 Trump
 had
 to
 say
 about


Ukraine
 in
 today's
 meeting.
 Just
 a
 few


weeks
 ago
 at
 you
 said
 that
 Ukraine
 could


possibly
 win
 the
 war
 and


>> well
 they
 could
 territory
 but
 now


>> they
 could
 still
 win
 it.
 I
 don't
 think


they
 will
 but
 they
 could
 still
 win
 it.
 I


never
 said
 they
 would
 win
 it.
 I
 said


they
 could
 win.
 Anything
 could
 happen.


You
 know
 war
 is
 a
 very
 strange
 thing.
 A


lot
 of
 bad
 things
 happen.
 A
 lot
 of
 good


things
 happen.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 Middle


East,
 uh
 I
 would
 say
 prior
 to
 us
 hitting


Iran
 so
 hard,
 we
 could
 have
 never
 made


that
 deal
 because
 you
 would
 have
 had
 a


dark
 cloud
 over
 the
 Middle
 East
 when
 we


took
 out
 their
 nuclear
 capability,
 which


was
 one
 of
 the
 great
 military
 maneuvers


of
 all
 time.
 It
 was
 flawless.
 You
 saw


that?


>> Yeah,


>> those
 magnificent
 B2s.
 I
 mean
 that
 was
 a


flawless
 move
 that
 was
 done
 by
 some
 very


talented
 people
 headed
 up
 by
 Pete
 and


everybody
 else
 and
 our
 great
 generals


and
 general
 in
 particular
 raisin
 Kaine.


Uh
 we
 did
 a
 we
 did
 a
 great
 job
 and
 when


that
 happened
 everything
 was
 different


and
 we
 were
 able
 to
 get
 a
 deal.


>> Just
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago
 I
 know
 you
 said


that.


>> So
 I
 mean
 look
 Trump
 is
 pretty
 bullish


that
 this
 war
 can
 come
 to
 an
 end
 with


Ukraine
 and
 Russia.
 We're
 going
 to
 see


how
 this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 But
 it
 is


nice
 to
 see
 that
 uh
 there
 is
 a
 little


bit
 more
 peace
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.
 And


if
 that
 they
 can
 get
 that
 done
 across


the
 rest
 of
 the
 world,
 the
 markets


definitely
 would
 be
 happy
 to
 have
 a


little
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 geopolitically


stable
 environment
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of


the
 year.
 Now,
 GSIT,
 we
 looked
 at
 this


in
 the
 morning.
 These
 guys
 published
 a


white
 paper.
 They've
 been
 published


since
 2007.
 Stock
 was
 up
 155%.
 Let
 me


know if
 anyone
 made
 any
 money
 on
 this


name
 today.
 They
 published
 a
 white
 paper


saying
 that
 they
 can
 create
 better
 GPUs


that
 use
 less
 energy
 than
 the
 current


ones
 on
 the
 market
 and
 that's
 what
 took


the
 stock
 up


155%
 in
 a
 day.
 Added
 about
 $300
 million


in
 market
 cap.
 It
 was
 a
 Cornell
 study


that
 they
 did


and
 uh


yeah,
 as
 a
 result
 this
 one
 went
 green.


We're
 going
 to
 see
 tomorrow
 if
 this
 one


is
 actually
 going
 to
 continue
 green.


I've
 never
 heard
 of
 GSI
 Technology.


It's
 a
 random
 random
 small
 cap.
 This
 is


their
 website.


I
 don't
 really
 know
 if
 these
 are
 the


guys
 to
 take
 down
 Nvidia.


I
 can
 publish
 a
 paper,
 too.
 Yeah,
 dude.


We
 can
 go
 to
 freaking
 Grock
 and
 say,


"Hey,
 build
 me
 a
 white
 paper
 about
 a


better
 AI
 system
 that
 can
 use
 less


energy."
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 I'm
 not
 even


trying
 to
 deny
 the
 legitimacy
 of
 their


white
 paper.
 I'm
 just
 like,
 really?
 The


stock's
 going
 to
 go
 up
 200%
 in
 a
 day?


Not
 for
 revenue,
 not
 for
 earnings,
 not


for
 a
 deal,
 not
 for
 any
 level
 of


paradigm
 shift
 with
 the
 with
 the
 cloud


computers
 or
 with
 the
 with
 the


hyperscalers,


but
 because
 of
 freaking


a
 paper
 that
 they
 put
 out.


And
 so,
 I
 don't
 know,
 that's
 what
 you


got
 from
 there.
 Now,
 we
 did
 have,
 you


know,
 speaking
 of
 new
 forms
 of


computing,
 you
 did
 have
 a
 prominent
 CEO,


uh,
 talk
 about
 quantum,
 which
 although


the
 stocks
 have
 been
 running
 like
 crazy,


the
 underlying
 technology
 might
 be
 more


real
 than
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 think.


And
 it
 might
 be
 with
 it
 might
 be
 with


Google.
 Here
 is
 Sundar
 last
 week
 saying


that
 quantum
 in
 the
 eyes
 of
 Google
 is


becoming
 more
 real.
 week
 you
 know
 I


spent
 for
 maybe
 two
 weeks
 ago
 now
 I
 I


Monday
 I'd
 gone
 to
 Santa
 Barbara
 in
 our


quantum
 lab
 I
 met
 with
 the
 team
 again


it's
 another
 journey
 we've
 been
 at
 it


for
 more
 than
 10
 years
 I
 think
 we
 have


the
 leading
 quantum
 lab
 in
 the
 world
 uh


I
 finished
 spending
 my
 day
 I
 left
 on


Monday
 and
 Tuesday
 morning
 I
 found
 our


chief
 scientist
 there
 won
 the
 Nobel


prize
 uh
 for
 uh
 physics
 this
 year
 right


and
 uh
 and
 this
 is
 the
 second
 year
 in
 a


row
 you
 mentioned
 deis
 and
 John
 Jumper


last
 year
 but
 we
 believe
 in
 that
 kind
 of


deep
 fundamental
 R&D
 right
 and
 and
 with


a
 view
 of
 translating
 that
 into
 real


products
 that
 same
 quantum
 computing


team
 no
 different
 from
 our
 TPU
 teams
 you


know
 plans
 to
 have
 commercially


available
 uh
 real
 at
 scale
 quantum


computers
 in
 a
 few
 years
 and
 I
 think


they
 will
 get
 there
 right
 so
 when
 you


talk
 about
 now
 10
 years
 ahead
 we
 are


building
 this
 digital
 intelligence
 layer


not
 just
 us


>> the
 10
 years
 quantum
 is
 real
 is
 your


point.


>> At least
 I
 I
 for
 sure
 think
 so.
 I'm
 very


very
 bullish
 and
 confident
 on
 it.


>> There
 you
 go.
 Sundar
 endorsing
 in
 10


years
 quantum
 is
 real.
 Now
 does
 that


mean
 all
 these
 quantum
 stocks
 deserve
 to


get
 a
 you
 know
 18,000
 times
 price
 to


sales
 premium
 uh
 before
 it
 manifests


itself?
 Maybe.
 Or
 maybe
 Google's
 the
 one


that
 ends
 up
 figuring
 it
 out
 and
 all


these
 other
 quantum
 stocks
 go
 to
 zero.
 I


mean
 you've
 got
 to
 really
 dive
 into
 the


nuances
 of
 this.
 But
 you
 do
 have
 one
 of


the
 CEOs
 of
 the
 fourth
 largest
 company


on
 the
 planet
 saying
 that
 he
 thinks


quantum
 is
 real.


>> I've
 seen
 the


>> Is
 that
 going
 to
 put
 at
 odds


cryptography
 as
 we
 know
 it
 today?
 Are


cryptocurrencies
 going
 to
 be
 at
 risk


with
 quantum
 computing
 that
 can
 break


any
 any
 code
 you
 know
 available
 from
 a


Google
 or
 other
 vendors.


>> I
 think
 in
 a
 3
 to
 5
 year
 thing
 we
 will


have
 that
 moment
 where
 from
 a


cryptographic
 standpoint
 we
 have
 to


adapt
 to
 quantum
 for
 sure.
 Yeah,


>> but
 I
 think
 we
 will.


>> Will
 that
 create
 a
 moment
 of


vulnerability
 do
 you
 think
 for
 all
 of


these
 currencies
 and
 all
 of
 this
 stuff?


>> It
 will,
 but
 I
 think
 as
 a
 society
 we


it'll
 also
 create
 an
 opportunity
 for


people
 to
 come
 and
 provide
 new


solutions.


>> If
 there
 is
 a
 trust
 gap
 at
 that
 moment


that
 could
 be
 very
 serious.
 So
 it's


something
 that
 needs
 everyone
 needs
 to


be
 mindful
 about


>> mindful
 of
 and
 I
 think
 there's
 so
 much


at
 stake.
 I
 think
 we
 will
 you
 know
 we


will
 we
 will
 collectively
 work
 together.


Uh
 but
 on
 the
 positive
 side,
 you
 know,


if
 you
 ask
 me
 10
 years
 from,
 look,
 we
 we


are
 definitely
 going
 to
 have
 digital


super
 intelligence
 as
 a
 collaborator
 for


all
 of
 us.
 That
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


reality.


>> What
 does
 that
 mean?
 That
 has
 been
 a


phrase
 that
 everyone
 is
 starting
 to
 use,


but
 few
 have
 been
 able
 to
 define
 it.


Digital
 super
 intelligence.
 And
 is
 that


kind
 of
 where
 we're
 going
 then?
 It's
 10


years.
 It's
 digital
 super
 intelligence.


It's
 quantum
 computing.
 Like
 when
 you


were
 talking
 about
 AGI
 that
 term
 seems


to
 be
 dropped.
 That
 was
 this
 concept


that
 the
 software
 is
 so
 smart
 it's
 just


writing
 itself
 and
 it's
 the
 data
 centers


are
 being
 built
 by
 robots
 and
 it's
 just


all
 going
 in
 the
 book
 that
 Larry
 talks


about.
 You
 know
 we
 are
 Legion,
 we
 are


Bob.
 You
 know
 that
 that
 we're
 all
 off
 in


a
 rocket
 ship
 collectively
 waking
 up
 in


a
 robot.
 Is
 that
 what's
 what
 we're


talking
 about?


>> No.


>> Because
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 that


yesterday
 with
 Brett
 and
 I
 was
 like


whoa.
 It
 was
 a
 trip.
 Look
 the
 the the


one
 thing
 we
 are
 so
 good
 at
 adapting.
 I


think
 we
 constantly
 underestimate
 right


obviously


10
 years
 ago
 we
 used
 to
 obsessively
 talk


about
 Turing
 tests
 like
 we
 kind
 of
 went


moved
 past
 it.
 The
 fact
 that
 our


self-driving
 cars
 driving
 in
 San


Francisco
 and
 you
 did
 you're
 right


they're
 driving
 around.
 It's
 kind
 of


like
 people
 are
 you
 know
 we
 just
 kind
 of


like
 I'm
 not
 sure
 my
 kids
 are
 impressed


by
 that.
 Right.
 So
 it's
 just,
 you
 know,


like
 I
 am
 like
 blown
 away
 every
 time
 I


get
 in
 one
 of
 those
 cars
 because
 I've,


you
 know,
 seen
 the
 progress.


>> How
 many
 people
 here
 have
 been
 in
 a


Whimo?
 Raise
 your
 hand.


>> So
 look,
 you
 got
 Sundar
 who's
 pretty


bullish
 over
 the
 next
 10
 years
 on


overall
 technology
 and
 obviously
 Sundar


is
 also,
 you
 know,
 pumping
 his
 book


right
 here
 because
 he
 is
 building
 uh


quantum
 commercial
 applications
 via


Google.
 So
 of
 course
 he's
 going
 to
 be


bullish
 on
 the
 concept.
 I
 don't
 know
 a


lot
 about
 quantum.
 The
 only
 use
 case


that
 I
 hear
 people
 talk
 about
 is
 that
 it


can
 hack
 your
 Bitcoin.
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 if


it
 can
 actually
 hack
 your
 Bitcoin.


I
 kind
 of
 don't
 care
 if
 it
 can
 hack
 your


Bitcoin.
 Like
 I
 mean,
 if
 it
 hacks
 the


bit,
 okay,
 then
 Bitcoin
 is
 a
 dud.
 It's


whatever.
 Like,
 I
 kind
 of
 I
 don't
 care


that
 much
 about
 it.
 If
 it
 if
 it
 doesn't,


then
 cool.
 Bitcoin's
 fine.
 So,
 now
 if


you're
 a
 Bitcoin
 maxi,
 you
 probably
 are


very
 very
 passionate
 about
 if
 it
 can


hack
 your
 Bitcoin
 or
 not.
 So,
 I
 guess


it's
 an
 important
 conversation.
 Um,
 I
 I


don't
 care
 that
 much
 about
 it,
 but


nonetheless,
 even
 Sundar
 didn't


definitively
 say
 it's
 not
 going
 to


happen.
 Sundar
 said,
 "We're
 going
 to


have
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 adapt
 to
 a
 world


with
 cryptography
 dealing
 with
 quantum."


Now,
 Skrey
 is
 convinced
 that
 quantum
 is


going
 to
 hack
 Bitcoin
 one
 day.
 I
 mean,


he
 he
 says
 one
 of
 his
 life's
 mission
 is


to
 use
 quantum
 computers
 to
 hack


Bitcoin,
 which
 is
 why
 he's
 so
 bearish
 to


quantum
 stocks
 because
 he's
 like
 the


only
 real
 use
 case
 is
 cryptography,
 not


all
 this
 other
 stuff
 that
 the
 the
 bulls


in
 the
 in
 the
 quantum
 names
 would
 would


preach
 as
 like
 the
 next
 generation
 of


beating
 Nvidia
 GPUs.
 Maybe
 he's
 wrong


about
 that.
 As
 Sundar
 is
 saying,
 yeah,


quantum
 computing
 is
 coming.
 Maybe
 it's


going
 to
 be
 more
 important
 than
 Nvidia.


Maybe
 it's
 a
 massive
 bare
 case
 for


Nvidia.
 And
 that
 I
 do
 care
 about
 because


I
 do
 own
 a
 lot
 of
 Nvidia.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 I


do
 think
 quantum
 requires
 attention
 to


understand.
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 if
 there's


any
 meaningful
 commercial
 application


over
 the
 next
 at least
 5
 years.
 Enough


that
 could
 hack
 your
 Bitcoin
 or
 enough


that
 could
 say
 Nvidia
 GPUs
 are
 inferior


compared
 to
 compared
 to
 uh
 quantum


computers.


And
 I
 guess
 over
 time
 we're
 going
 to
 see


how
 this
 plays
 out.
 Kirk
 says,
 "I
 agree


with
 Steve
 that
 the
 big
 guys
 will
 figure


quantum
 up
 and
 these
 pure
 play
 quantum


stocks
 are
 a
 huge
 bubble."


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 look,
 if
 that
 is
 the
 case,


it's
 not
 just
 going
 to
 be
 Google,
 it's


going
 to
 be
 IBM,
 Microsoft,
 all
 of
 big


tech
 is
 going
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to
 get


exposure
 to
 this.
 Maybe
 they
 have
 to
 buy


out
 some
 of
 those
 smaller
 firms
 or
 maybe


those
 smaller
 firms
 have
 zero
 value
 to
 a


Google
 that
 has
 their
 own
 quantum
 lab.


So
 why
 would
 they
 buy
 out
 D-Wave
 or


Regetti
 or
 OQ?
 Like
 I
 may,
 you
 know,


they
 would
 have
 no
 meaningful
 reason
 to


do
 it
 and
 then
 those
 stocks
 potentially


go
 to
 zero.


But
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see.


Uh,
 if
 Quantum
 can
 hack
 your
 Bitcoin,
 it


could
 easily
 hack
 your
 fourdigit
 bank


code.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 like
 that's
 another


uh
 sort
 of
 retort
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the


Bitcoin
 maxis
 will
 give,
 which
 is
 like


if
 quantum
 computers
 are
 so
 strong


enough
 to
 hack
 cryptography,
 why


wouldn't
 they
 be
 able
 to
 hack
 something


that's
 quote
 unquote
 encrypted
 via
 Bank


of
 America
 or
 Chase's
 ledger?
 I
 don't


know.
 I
 haven't
 done
 enough
 research
 to


understand
 the
 potential
 of
 quantum,
 but


we're
 gonna
 have
 to
 see
 how
 it
 all


ultimately
 plays
 out.
 It
 It
 was
 probably


pretty
 bullish
 though
 to
 see
 Sundar
 say


like
 he
 thinks
 it's
 real
 and
 he
 thinks


it's
 coming.
 The
 question
 is
 will
 the


commercial
 applications
 be


revenue
 generating
 over
 the
 coming


years?


Um,


gold
 still
 up
 after
 hours,
 not
 slowing


down.
 4350.


Again,
 the
 rally
 in
 gold
 has
 been
 just


unbelievable.
 But
 this
 one
 continues
 to


go
 higher.
 I
 asked
 in
 the
 morning,
 do


people
 think
 gold
 is
 a
 bubble?
 And
 I


mean,
 most
 people
 said
 no,
 but
 they


definitely
 wouldn't
 buy
 gold
 right
 here.


Take
 a
 look
 at
 this
 chart
 from
 Bank
 of


America.
 The
 4-week
 moving
 average
 of


inflows
 into
 gold
 and
 silver
 hit
 7.5


billion.
 an
 all-time
 record.
 Over
 the


last
 10
 weeks,
 gold
 funds
 have
 posted
 a


whopping
 34.2


billion
 in
 net
 inflows.
 That's
 3.4


billion
 coming
 into
 gold
 and
 silver
 ETFs


every
 week
 for
 the
 past
 10
 weeks.


And
 people
 are
 really
 not
 seeing
 Bitcoin


as
 digital
 gold.
 They're
 seeing
 gold
 as


the
 real
 gold.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 if


that's
 super
 bullish
 Bitcoin
 or
 super


bearish
 gold
 or
 if
 it's
 super
 bullish


gold
 and
 super
 bullish
 Bitcoin
 as
 I
 mean


like
 or
 if
 it's
 bearish,
 both
 can't


catch
 a
 bid
 or
 one
 is
 catching
 a
 bid


from
 Euphoria.
 One
 just
 simply
 can't


catch
 a
 bid
 because
 there's
 not
 enough


liquidity.
 I
 mean,
 even
 if
 you
 look
 at


the
 retail
 trends
 on
 like
 the
 search


terms
 for
 Bitcoin
 on
 Google
 Trends,
 it's


not
 even
 at
 2017
 levels.
 I
 mean,
 it's


disgusting.


Coinbase
 is
 not
 even
 in
 the
 top
 200
 apps


in
 the
 app
 store.


So,
 it
 it
 really
 makes
 you
 wonder
 what


is
 going
 on.
 Where
 is
 retail?
 Why
 are


they
 not
 excited?
 Look
 at
 this.
 How
 to


buy
 Bitcoin.


Look
 at
 the
 interest.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 at


freaking
 10
 on
 the
 overall
 scale.
 If
 we


just
 type
 in
 Bitcoin
 in
 general,
 yeah,


the
 interest
 is
 at
 26,
 a
 little
 bit


better,
 but
 like
 it's
 nowhere
 near
 2021,


nowhere
 near
 even
 March
 of
 2024
 when


Bitcoin
 hit
 70,000
 for
 the
 first
 time.


I
 don't
 think
 there's
 a
 retail
 rally


happening
 in
 crypto
 until
 there's
 a


catalyst.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 that


catalyst
 is.
 And
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 why
 I'm


liking
 BMR
 a
 lot
 more
 than
 the
 Bitcoin


derivative
 plays.
 I
 think
 there
 is
 a


legitimate
 catalyst
 for
 Ethereum.
 And


that
 catalyst
 is
 the
 use
 case
 around


stable
 stable
 coins
 and
 tokenization.


With
 Bitcoin,
 the
 catalyst
 has
 always


been
 store
 of
 value.
 But
 if
 people
 are


thinking
 of
 gold
 as
 their
 store
 of
 value


over
 Bitcoin,
 at least
 right
 now
 in
 the


moment,
 you
 don't
 have
 that
 massive


catalyst
 to
 get
 retail
 super
 energized.


And
 you
 know,
 maybe
 that's
 just
 going
 to


take
 more
 time,
 but
 if
 this
 thing's


going
 to
 200,000
 by
 end
 of
 year,
 you
 got


two
 months
 left
 to
 see
 if
 that
 catalyst


ends
 up
 playing
 out.


So,
 that
 what
 we
 got.
 That's
 what
 we
 got


on
 crypto.
 Maybe
 they're
 asking
 Chad


GBT.
 Yeah,
 Chad
 could
 definitely
 be


taking
 some
 of
 that
 traffic,
 but
 for
 it


to
 be
 that
 depressed
 on
 Google
 Trends
 is


weird,
 right?
 Like
 you
 would
 expect
 more


retail
 to
 be
 it's
 a
 bull
 market
 and


rates
 are
 coming
 down
 and
 like
 retail
 is


not
 searching
 about
 Bitcoin,
 which
 is


actually
 not
 that
 good
 for
 Robin
 Hood,


dude.
 Robin
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 off


crypto
 transactions
 and
 uh
 if
 if
 if


retail
 is
 not
 that
 interested
 in


Bitcoin,
 you
 might
 not
 have
 a
 lot
 of


crypto
 volumes
 going
 into
 Q3,
 Q4


earnings,
 which
 is
 not
 the
 best
 thing


for
 Hood,
 not
 the
 best
 thing
 for
 Weeble.


So,


it's
 one
 of
 those
 things
 that
 we
 have
 to


see
 what
 turns
 out
 to
 be
 that
 catalyst


that
 potentially
 get
 the
 biggest


catalyst
 if
 Bitcoin
 just
 goes
 up.
 You


know,
 if
 it
 gets
 back
 to
 120,
 130,
 140,


you're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 lot of
 people


that
 start
 buying.
 But


until
 then,
 it
 might
 be
 very
 flat.
 Do


Ethereum.
 Yeah,
 that's
 a
 good
 question.


I
 should
 do
 Ethereum.


Uh,
 so
 Bitcoin's
 at
 what,
 26
 right
 now.


Let's
 see.
 Ethereum.


Ethereum's
 worse
 at
 13.


How
 to
 buy
 Ethereum.
 Let's
 do
 BMR
 next.


Dude,
 how
 to
 buy
 Ethereum's
 at
 two.
 No


one
 cares
 about
 Ethereum.
 Okay,
 what


about
 BMR?


BMR
 is
 at
 37.
 BMR
 is
 three
 times
 higher


in
 search
 volume
 than
 freaking
 Ethereum.


That
 is
 hilarious,
 bro.


No
 one
 gives
 a
 [ __ ]
 about
 ETH.
 They
 they


just
 care
 about
 Bitmine,
 which


ironically
 started
 off
 as
 a
 Bitcoin


miner
 and
 then
 Chain
 Link.


Chain
 Link's
 at
 20.
 Chain
 link's
 higher


than
 Ethereum.
 Chain
 link's
 at
 21.


Ethereum
 is
 at
 13.


How
 to
 buy
 Chain
 Link?


Buying
 gets
 basically
 at
 zero.
 But
 at


least
 the
 term
 is
 getting
 a
 lot
 more


excitement
 than
 Ethereum
 itself.
 What


about
 XRP?


XRP
 is
 higher
 than
 Ethereum
 as
 well,
 23.


Now
 again,
 just
 being
 higher
 doesn't


translate
 into
 outperformance.
 But
 it
 it


goes
 to
 show
 across
 the
 board
 the
 fact


that
 these
 numbers
 are
 not
 above
 50
 on


Bitcoin,
 Ethereum,
 Salana,


etc.
 Just
 means
 retail
 is
 not
 that


excited.
 Salana
 is
 at
 34.
 They're
 not


that
 excited
 about
 crypto
 right
 now.


They're
 just
 not.


Do
 Fartcoin,
 dude.
 Fcoin
 is
 higher
 than


Ethereum.


Okay,
 it's
 at
 five.
 It's
 lower
 than


Ethereum,
 but
 imagine
 if
 it
 was
 higher.


People
 just
 don't
 care
 that
 much.


At
 least
 not
 right
 now.
 Yo,
 what
 about


gold?
 Yeah,
 let
 me
 do
 gold.
 Gold's
 got


to
 be
 above
 50


6
 80
 82.


This
 is
 the
 last
 time
 it
 got
 up
 here
 was


in
 2024
 April.
 That's
 when
 the
 Israel


Iran
 conflict
 was
 breaking
 out.
 You
 guys


remember
 S&P
 was
 at
 492.
 Uh
 oh,
 sorry.


This
 is
 August.
 This
 was
 yen
 carry


trade,
 but
 it
 did
 spike
 a
 little
 bit
 in


April
 as
 well.
 Uh
 what
 about
 how
 to
 buy


gold?
 So,
 we
 haven't
 seen
 gold
 at
 these


levels
 since


August
 2024.
 How
 to
 buy
 gold,
 dude?
 Two


weeks
 ago.


Is
 this
 two
 weeks
 ago?
 No,
 three
 months


ago
 it
 was
 at
 100.
 Now
 it's
 at
 67.


That
 is
 significantly
 higher.
 That
 is


five
 times
 higher
 than
 Bitcoin
 or
 sorry


five
 times
 higher
 than
 Ethereum
 and
 two


times
 higher
 than
 Bitcoin.


Maybe
 the
 bubbles
 in
 gold.
 May
 maybe


it's
 not.


Maybe
 that's
 it.
 I
 don't
 know.


I
 don't
 freaking
 know.


But
 it
 is
 quite
 incredible
 to
 see
 retail


knock.
 And
 again,
 this
 isn't
 bearish


Bitcoin,
 Ethereum,
 or
 anything
 like


that.
 I
 I
 I
 I
 really
 want
 those
 assets


to
 go
 up
 because
 I've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 names


that
 are
 associated
 with
 those
 assets.


The
 broader
 market
 tends
 to
 do
 better


when
 you
 have
 risk
 on
 assets
 like
 that


go
 up.
 I
 am
 just
 perplexed
 by
 the
 fact


that
 we're
 in
 a
 raging
 bull
 and
 retail


doesn't
 care
 about
 crypto,


which
 you
 know,
 I
 don't
 know
 what


changes
 that
 outside
 of
 price


performance,
 but
 you
 might
 need


institutional
 guys
 to
 get
 more
 excited


about
 the
 price
 to
 get
 it
 to
 go
 higher.


S&P
 500
 after
 hours
 up
 a
 little
 bit


more.
 672


on
 the
 S&P
 is
 what
 we've
 got
 right
 now.


I
 don't
 know
 about
 bubble
 when
 central


banks
 are
 buying
 all
 the
 gold.
 So,
 that


is
 a
 fair
 point.
 However,
 we
 were


listening
 to
 this
 clip
 last
 night
 and


Josh
 Brown
 made
 a
 good
 point
 about
 um


when
 the
 central
 banks
 were
 buying
 gold


like
 crazy
 back
 in
 2009
 because
 of
 the


great
 recession.


What
 popped
 the
 gold
 bubble
 that
 didn't


end
 up
 recovering
 for
 the
 next
 five


years
 was
 central
 banks
 selling
 a
 ton
 of


and
 the
 reason
 they
 sold
 a
 ton
 of
 gold


was
 because
 there
 was
 a
 recession
 and


they
 needed
 massive
 liquidity
 and
 gold


became
 the
 easiest
 way
 to
 get
 that


liquidity.
 Now,
 if
 we
 don't
 get
 a


recession,
 maybe
 that's
 not
 that
 much
 of


a
 concern.


central
 banks
 in
 and
 of
 themselves


being
 bullish
 on
 it.


Who
 knows
 if
 that's
 the


the
 lynch
 pin
 on
 on
 why
 gold
 continues


to
 persist
 the
 way
 the
 way
 it
 does?


>> European
 sovereigns,
 Asians,
 or
 they
 all


so
 like


>> But
 how
 does
 that
 change
 if
 it's
 a
 tier


one
 asset
 now
 on
 their
 balance
 sheet?
 It


is
 as
 good
 as
 cash.


>> Yes.
 But
 if
 you
 need
 the
 money,
 you
 need


the
 money.
 Yeah.
 The
 other
 thing
 that


could
 end
 it
 is
 if
 people
 get
 too


excited
 about
 gold.


>> Yeah.


>> Like
 big
 leverage
 coming
 in
 on
 the
 long


side.
 I
 don't
 know.
 Phil
 Phil
 probably


has
 like
 better
 better
 guesses
 than
 I


do,
 but
 like
 it
 it
 eventually
 does
 end,


but
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 end
 for
 10
 years.


Like
 there's
 no


>> it
 could
 be
 a
 big
 cycle
 here
 right
 now.


>> It
 could
 be
 a
 big
 deal,
 right?


>> It
 definitely
 and
 I
 and
 I
 think
 what


could
 end
 I
 mean
 there
 obviously
 be
 a


number
 of
 things
 and
 you
 and
 you
 look


back
 even
 co
 and
 I
 remember
 that
 it
 was


like
 the
 first
 week
 of
 March
 whenever


that
 Monday
 coming
 out
 of
 the
 oil
 Saudi


Arabia
 and
 Russia
 oil
 news
 and
 oil's


down
 10
 bucks
 gold
 made
 a
 high
 that


morning
 but
 then
 within
 weeks
 in
 in
 the


co
 shutdowns
 it
 was
 I
 think
 300
 bucks
 I


think
 it
 was
 1,700
 to
 1400
 and
 so
 gold


really
 sniffs
 out
 inflation
 and
 it


doesn't
 m
 it
 may
 not
 react
 how
 you
 would


expect
 during
 the
 inflation
 like
 in
 2022


Feds
 hiking
 rates
 The
 dollar
 is


strengthening.
 Gold
 was
 whacked,
 but
 it


smells
 inflation.
 So,
 so
 it's
 going
 to


it's
 going
 to
 see
 it
 and
 it's
 going
 to


react
 prior
 to
 the
 inflation.
 So,
 I


would
 say
 what
 we're
 seeing
 right
 now


potentially
 could
 be
 more
 inflation,
 but


then
 you're
 also
 getting
 the
 GDPs
 of
 of


Germany
 and
 Japan
 and
 things
 like
 that


that
 the
 dollar
 is
 actually
 rising
 in


and
 over
 this
 last
 week,
 last
 couple
 of


weeks
 when
 gold's
 been
 breaking
 out,


which
 is
 a
 pretty
 interesting


phenomenon.


>> That's
 rare.


>> While
 the
 tenure
 continues
 to
 go
 down


below
 4%.
 I
 mean,
 we
 really
 have
 not


seen
 something
 like
 this
 in
 history


before.
 By
 the
 way,
 AI
 bubble
 that's
 at


100.
 That's
 crazy,
 bro.
 AI
 bubble
 on


Google
 search
 trends
 is
 at
 100
 at least


for
 the
 last
 month.
 And
 Bitcoin


Ethereum,


okay,
 let
 me
 let
 me
 It's
 not
 a
 bottom


indicator,
 but
 it's
 at least
 not
 a
 top


signal.
 The
 AI
 bubble
 is
 at
 the
 top
 of


people's
 Google
 search
 results
 over
 how


to
 buy
 Bitcoin.


I
 think
 this
 is
 super
 bullish.
 You
 have


more
 people
 that
 are
 worried
 we're
 in
 a


bubble
 than
 people
 that
 are
 euphorically


worried
 about
 how
 to
 set
 up
 a
 Binance


account
 to
 get
 access
 to
 crypto.


Like,
 have
 have
 we
 topped
 before
 with


people
 typing
 in
 the
 term
 bubble
 at
 an


all-time
 high?
 No.
 You
 top
 when
 people


are
 feverishly
 searching
 for
 how
 to
 get


exposure
 because
 their
 neighbor
 is


getting
 rich
 off
 Bitcoin.


Like
 I
 don't
 see
 this
 as
 bearish.
 I


actually
 see
 this
 as
 as
 as


counterintuitively
 bullish.
 It's
 just,


you
 know,
 for
 the
 for
 the
 assets
 go
 like


Bitcoin,
 Ethereum,
 Salana,
 XRP.
 They're


not
 making
 those
 big
 moves
 people
 want


to
 make.
 But
 maybe
 that's
 because
 you


need
 them
 to
 take
 their
 time
 to
 make
 the


move,
 especially
 as
 liquidity
 is
 getting


sucked
 into
 gold
 and
 silver
 and


commodities.
 And
 then
 the
 sentiment


around
 the
 broader
 consensus
 is
 that


we're
 in
 a
 bubble
 based
 on
 these
 search


terms.


That
 to
 me
 signals
 that
 more
 people
 are


scared,
 which
 is
 what
 you
 need.
 Are
 we


in
 a
 bubble?


Wow,
 look
 at
 that.


69
 on
 the
 search
 results
 over
 the
 past
 5


years.
 That
 is
 the
 second
 highest
 it's


been
 since
 2022.


I
 mean,
 that's
 pretty
 incredible.
 AI


capex
 that
 is
 at
 21.
 It
 was
 up
 a
 little


bit
 last
 week
 as
 a
 search
 term,
 but
 that


bubble
 term,
 what
 about
 just
 bubble
 in


general?


Yeah,
 it's
 at
 55
 relatively
 consistent.


It's
 quite
 incredible
 to
 see
 the
 psyche


of
 how
 this
 is
 playing
 out.
 But
 again,
 I


think
 with
 good
 earnings,
 with
 rates


coming
 down,
 and
 with
 more
 people
 being


worried
 about
 an
 AI
 bubble
 than
 worried


about
 buying
 Bitcoin,
 it's
 hard
 to
 say


that
 it's
 super
 super
 bubbly.


which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.
 I
 think
 Micro


Strategy
 lost
 momentum.
 Micro
 Strategy


lost
 momentum
 because
 Bitcoin
 lost


momentum
 and
 until
 Bitcoin
 regains


momentum,
 a
 lot
 of these
 derivative


plays


are


going
 to
 get
 hit.


Now,
 the
 question
 is,
 does
 Micro


Strategy,
 you
 know,
 take
 a
 250
 or
 below


beating?
 That's
 when
 it
 really
 gets
 hit,


or
 does
 it
 chill
 out
 just
 below
 300?


Search
 for
 bubble
 gum.


Um,
 what
 about
 gold
 bubble?
 Yeah,
 let
 me


type
 in
 gold
 bubble.


That's
 getting
 up
 there.
 64


on
 gold
 bubble.
 That's
 the
 highest
 in


about
 a
 year
 and
 a
 or
 that's
 the
 highest


in
 four
 months.
 The
 second
 highest
 in


three
 years.
 Cryptobubble.


What
 about
 that?


13.
 Dude,
 no
 one's
 even
 searching
 for
 a


crypto
 bubble
 because
 Bitcoin's
 not


running
 like
 crazy
 enough
 to
 make
 you


afraid
 about
 that.
 I
 mean,
 like,
 there's


not
 that
 many
 people
 that
 care
 about
 the


state
 of
 crypto
 right
 now,
 which
 I
 think


is
 actually
 bullish


because
 eventually
 they
 will,
 and
 when


they
 do,
 that
 should
 help
 out
 a
 lot
 of


these
 currencies.


Do
 you
 still
 like
 Robin
 Hood?
 Yes,
 I


like
 Robin
 Hood
 even
 though
 everyone
 is


[ __ ]
 on
 Robin
 Hood
 today.


It
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 I
 think
 they
 will
 get


through
 it.
 Um,


and
 I
 think
 they'll
 be
 okay.
 And
 the


fact
 that
 the
 stock
 was
 up
 today
 just


goes
 to
 show
 how
 much
 the
 algorithms


didn't
 really
 care
 about
 the
 sentiment


on
 Hood.
 They
 just
 cared
 about
 going


higher.
 As
 you
 know,
 the
 S&P
 breaks
 out


to
 alltime
 highs,
 which
 it
 almost
 got
 to


today.
 You're
 going
 to
 have
 Hood,
 which


is
 a
 proxy
 in
 the
 bull
 market,
 go
 a
 bit


higher.


And
 that's
 why
 that
 stock
 was
 up
 5%.


All right,
 I
 think
 we
 are
 done
 for
 the


day,
 folks.
 Um,
 I
 will
 be
 back


tomorrow.
 Actually,
 hold
 on.
 We
 got
 to


search
 quantum.
 We
 didn't
 even
 search


freaking
 quantum.
 Google
 trends.
 Let's


do
 that.
 There
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 a


daily
 recap
 today
 because
 I'm
 about
 to


leave
 to
 um


to
 where
 am
 I
 going
 to?
 To
 my
 parents


house
 for
 Dvali.
 Happy
 Dvali
 to
 those


who
 celebrate.
 So,
 we
 are
 not
 going
 to


have
 a
 daily
 recap
 today,
 but
 we
 will
 be


back
 tomorrow


and
 we'll
 recap
 everything
 that
 we
 had.


Quantum.


Okay.
 Okay,
 so
 Quantum
 had
 a
 massive


spike
 back
 in
 April
 2025
 and
 now
 it's


back
 down
 to
 zero.


Quantum
 stocks,


you're
 seeing
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 elevated


excitement
 than
 usual.
 You're
 at
 40,


22,
 23,
 you're
 basically
 at
 zero.
 So,


it's
 definitely
 trending
 more,
 but
 it's


not
 like
 a
 hundred.
 It's
 defin
 it's
 not


in
 the
 70s
 and
 80s
 like
 we
 saw
 with
 how


to
 buy
 gold.


They
 do
 have
 some
 people
 that
 are


excited.
 What
 about
 Nvidia?
 That's
 we


got
 to
 search
 Nvidia.
 Nvidia


Nvidia
 is
 also
 relatively
 relaxed.
 28
 on


Nvidia.
 Not
 too
 too
 crazy.


How's
 all
 that
 compared
 to
 Taylor?


Swift.
 That's
 a
 good
 qu.
 Well,
 she
 just


released
 an
 album,
 so
 that
 one
 should


really
 be
 moving.


Okay,
 it's
 in
 the
 20s.


Not
 as
 high
 as
 in
 video.
 All right,


cool.
 That's
 it
 for
 me.
 I'll
 be
 back


tomorrow.
 Thank
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 Happy
 Dvali
 to
 those
 who
 celebrate


it.
 I
 am
 going
 to
 uh
 go
 home
 to
 family.


I'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow
 on
 the
 market


open.
 Again,
 note
 uh
 there's
 not
 going


to
 be
 a
 daily
 recap
 today.
 And
 I'm
 not


doing
 tech
 bros.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 Tanner


and
 Roy
 are
 doing
 it.
 They
 might.
 I
 told


them
 last
 week
 I
 I
 think
 they
 still


might
 do
 it.
 If
 they
 don't
 do
 it,
 then


we'll
 be
 back
 next
 Monday.
 But
 if
 they


do
 it,
 then
 it'll
 be
 on
 one
 of
 their


channels.


And
 we'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow.
 Uh
 technical


Tuesday
 tomorrow.
 Tesla
 earnings
 is
 on


Wednesday.
 So,
 we'll
 have
 Jason
 tomorrow


and
 then
 we'll
 have
 Tesla
 Wednesday,


Netflix
 Thursday,


and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


And
 that's
 what
 we
 got.


All
 right,
 thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 Happy
 Dvali
 to
 those
 who


celebrate
 it.
 I
 will
 be
 back
 tomorrow


morning
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 the


summary
 of
 today
 is
 China
 deescalation,


rates
 coming
 down,
 tenure
 below
 4%,
 S&P


very
 close
 to
 all-time
 highs
 with
 a
 lot


of
 the
 frothy
 names
 down
 on
 the
 day
 is
 a


nice
 setup
 going
 into
 earnings
 and
 based


on
 Trump's
 comments
 on
 China
 if
 we
 get
 a


good
 negotiation
 over
 the
 next
 two


weeks.
 We
 might
 be
 able
 to
 really
 get


some
 momentum
 here.
 So
 that's
 what
 we


got.
 All right,
 thank
 you everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys


tomorrow
 on
 the
 market
 open.
 Bye


everybody.
 Have
 a
 good
 one.
