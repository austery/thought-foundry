From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Natalie


Kitroof.
 This
 is

[Music]


The
 Supreme
 Court
 began
 a
 new
 term
 this


week,
 one
 where
 the
 justices
 will
 weigh


in
 on
 issues
 of
 presidential
 power
 and


on
 the
 most
 consequential
 culture
 war


battles
 in
 America.


In
 one
 of the
 first
 cases,
 the
 court


considered
 whether
 to
 strike
 down
 a
 ban


on
 conversion
 therapy,
 the
 controversial


practice
 aimed
 at
 changing
 someone's


sexual
 orientation.


Today,
 my
 colleague
 Anne
 Marramo
 walks


us
 through
 that
 case.


It's
 Thursday,
 October
 9th.


Ann,
 welcome
 to
 the
 Daily.
 First
 time
 on


the
 show
 as
 our
 new
 Supreme
 Court


correspondent.


Thank
 you.
 I'm
 really
 happy
 to
 be
 here.


I'm
 really
 excited
 to
 talk
 to
 you


because
 we
 are
 at
 the
 start
 of
 a
 new


Supreme
 Court
 term
 and
 it's
 one
 I
 think


a
 lot
 of
 us
 have
 been
 anticipating
 and


waiting
 for
 because
 the
 court
 is
 going


to
 be
 ruling
 on
 a
 number
 of
 big


questions.
 We
 know
 that
 there
 are
 big


questions
 related
 to
 the
 Trump


administration
 among
 all
 these
 other


cases
 on
 the
 docket.
 So
 I
 want
 to
 ask


how
 you
 weigh
 the
 importance
 of
 the


cases
 that
 are
 before
 the
 court
 right


now.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 as
 you
 said,
 it's
 a
 huge


term.
 The
 Trump
 administration's
 agenda


is
 really
 going
 to
 dominate
 a
 lot
 of
 the


docket,
 right?
 Already,
 we
 have
 in


November
 the
 case
 about
 Trump's
 sweeping


tariffs.
 They're
 going
 to
 look
 at


whether
 the
 president
 has
 the
 power
 to


fire
 independent
 government
 regulators


who
 are
 supposed
 to
 be
 protected
 by


Congress.
 And
 then
 in
 January,
 they're


going
 to
 look
 at
 does
 the
 president
 have


the
 authority
 to
 fire
 a
 governor
 of
 the


independent
 Federal
 Reserve
 Board.


Right?
 So,
 some
 pretty
 big
 questions


about
 what
 Trump
 can
 and
 can't
 do.


Exactly.
 But
 there
 are
 also
 all
 of
 these


other
 cases
 that
 will
 have
 critical


impact
 on
 the
 lives
 of
 Americans
 that


are
 as
 important
 and
 that
 we're
 also


watching
 this
 term.
 The
 court's
 going
 to


look
 at
 the
 rights
 of
 transgender


athletes
 to
 participate
 in
 girls
 and


women's
 sports,
 the
 religious
 rights
 of


prisoners,
 and
 the
 court
 wasted
 no
 time


in
 its
 first
 week
 back
 on
 the
 bench


turning
 to
 one
 of
 these
 big
 culture
 war


issues
 and
 taking
 up
 the
 issue
 of


whether
 or
 not
 states
 can
 ban
 conversion


therapy
 for
 minors.


Okay.
 So
 tell
 me
 about
 this
 case
 that
 we


saw
 this
 week.
 Because
 I
 think
 for
 a
 lot


of
 us
 that
 are
 on
 the
 sidelines
 here,
 it


seemed
 as
 though
 this
 case
 had
 kind
 of


revived
 an
 issue
 that
 had
 been


discredited
 a
 long
 time
 ago.
 Conversion


therapy.
 It's
 something
 that
 feels
 a


little
 like
 it's
 from
 another
 era
 and


now
 it's
 before
 the
 court.
 That's
 right.


So
 starting
 in
 about
 the
 1990s,
 major


medical
 associations
 had
 come
 to
 this


consensus
 that
 counseling
 that
 aimed
 to


change
 the
 sexual
 orientation
 of
 gay


teenagers
 or
 gender
 identity
 of


transgendered
 teens
 was
 really
 viewed
 as


harmful
 and
 widely
 rejected.
 A
 lot
 of


state
 legislators
 started
 to
 pass
 laws


between
 2012
 and
 2024
 to
 place


restrictions
 on
 this
 type
 of
 therapy
 for


minors.
 So
 this
 case
 arose
 out
 of


Colorado
 which
 is
 one
 of
 more
 than
 20


states
 with
 these
 similar
 laws.


And
 what
 exactly
 did
 these
 laws
 say


broadly
 speaking?


Yes.
 So
 Colorado's
 law
 and
 the
 laws
 like


it
 basically
 say
 that
 any
 practice
 or


treatment
 that
 tries
 to
 change
 a
 minor's


gender
 expression
 or
 eliminate
 their


attractions
 to
 people
 of
 the
 same
 sex


are
 ineffective
 and
 harmful
 and
 cannot


be
 practiced
 in
 those
 states.
 And
 so


tell
 me
 about
 the
 challenge
 to
 that
 law


in
 Colorado.
 What's
 the
 case
 there?


So
 Colorado's
 law
 was
 passed
 back
 in


2019.
 This
 lawsuit
 was
 not
 filed
 until


2022
 by
 Kaye
 Childs.
 She
 practices
 in
 a


small
 bungalow
 office
 in
 Colorado


Springs
 downtown
 right
 near
 Colorado.


She
 said
 that
 she
 wants
 to
 have


voluntary
 conversations
 with
 young


people
 who
 want
 to
 try
 to
 live
 a
 life


consistent
 with
 their
 faith.
 She
 gets


some
 referrals
 through
 churches
 and
 she


says
 that
 Colorado's
 law
 is
 interfering


with
 those
 conversations
 in
 violation
 of


her
 free
 speech
 rights.


And
 just
 to
 be
 clear,
 has
 she
 actually


gotten
 in
 trouble
 for
 doing
 this?


No.
 Colorado's
 law
 has
 never
 been


enforced
 against
 anyone.
 Um,
 it
 includes


fines
 of
 up
 to
 $5,000.
 Therapists
 can


lose
 their
 licenses,
 but
 she
 has
 never


been
 prosecuted
 for
 this
 or
 charged.
 But


she
 says
 that
 her
 speech
 is
 being


chilled
 because
 she's
 concerned
 about


crossing
 that
 line.
 And
 so
 she's
 being


represented
 by
 a
 real
 powerhouse
 at
 the


Supreme
 Court.
 This
 is
 the
 Alliance


Defending
 Freedom,
 an
 Arizona
 based


Christian
 conservative
 law
 firm
 and


advocacy
 group
 that's
 been
 behind
 a
 lot


of
 cases
 at
 the
 court
 in
 recent
 years.


In
 2018,
 the
 court
 ruled
 in
 favor
 of
 one


of
 their
 clients,
 Jack
 Phillips,
 who
 is


a
 baker
 in
 Colorado,
 who
 had
 refused
 to


make
 a
 wedding
 cake
 for
 a
 gay
 couple.


And
 then
 in
 2023,
 the
 justices
 also


sided
 with
 ADF
 on
 another
 case
 from


Colorado.
 This
 was
 a
 web
 designer
 who


had
 refused
 to
 make
 wedding
 websites
 for


same-sex
 couples.
 And
 in
 each
 of
 these


cases,
 these
 are
 individuals
 saying
 that


their
 First
 Amendment
 rights
 are
 being


violated.


Yes.
 Just
 like
 child
 in
 the
 conversion


therapy
 case.


Okay.
 So,
 walk
 us
 through
 the
 oral


arguments
 in
 this
 case
 involving
 childs.


I
 I
 also
 listen
 to
 them.
 But
 what
 stood


out
 to
 you
 about
 how
 the
 arguments


unfolded?


We
 will
 hear
 argument
 first
 this
 morning


in
 case
 24539,


Childs
 versus
 Salazar,
 Mr.
 Campbell.


Thank
 you,
 Mr.
 Chief
 Justice,
 and
 may
 it


please
 the
 court.


So,
 the
 argument
 began
 with
 the
 lawyer


from
 Alliance
 Defending
 Freedom


representing
 the
 therapist.
 Colorado


forbids
 counselors
 like
 Kaye
 Childs
 from


helping
 minors
 pursue
 state
 disfavored


goals
 on
 issues
 of
 gender
 and
 sexuality.


He
 said
 Colorado
 can't
 turn
 this


therapist
 into
 what
 he
 said
 is
 a


mouthpiece
 for
 the
 government
 by
 forcing


her
 to
 have
 the
 types
 of
 conversations


the
 state
 thinks
 are
 appropriate.
 That


state
 should
 not
 manipulate
 private


conversations
 between
 licensed


professionals
 and
 clients.
 He
 said
 over


and
 over
 again
 that
 the
 state
 is


censoring
 her
 speech
 u
 violating
 her


ability
 to
 work
 with
 patients
 who
 come


to
 her
 voluntarily
 to
 get
 the
 type
 of


treatment
 they
 need


because
 the
 first
 amendment
 depends
 on


the
 difference
 between
 speech
 and


conduct
 not
 on
 the


So
 the
 therapist
 lawyer
 tried
 to
 make
 a


really
 clear
 distinction
 between
 the


voluntary
 talk
 therapy
 that
 she
 wants
 to


practice
 and
 traditional
 conduct
 doctors


administering
 pills
 or
 delivering
 some


sort
 of
 specific
 medical
 treatment.


medicine.
 So
 if
 we
 were
 in
 the
 medical


context
 and
 there
 was
 something
 like


administering
 drugs,
 performing


procedures,
 conducting
 examinations,


that
 would
 take
 it
 outside
 of
 the


arguments
 we're
 making.


Got
 it.
 So
 in
 this
 lawyer's
 view,
 what


he's
 saying
 is
 there's
 a
 difference


between
 being
 a
 doctor
 and
 handing


someone
 pills
 and
 being
 a
 therapist
 and


just
 talking
 to
 a
 patient.
 Exactly.
 And


that's
 a
 key
 distinction
 because
 the


first
 amendment
 protects
 speech
 and
 the


government
 can't
 infringe
 on
 the
 speech


of
 individuals
 and
 the
 court
 has
 said


that
 professionals
 don't
 lose
 that
 right


to
 free
 speech
 just
 because
 they're


operating
 in
 the
 professional
 context.


So
 if
 the
 court
 determines
 that
 this
 is


just
 aimed
 at
 speech,
 then
 the
 state


can't
 regulate
 that
 in
 a
 way
 that


discriminates
 based
 on
 viewpoint.
 in


contrast
 to
 states
 having
 the
 power
 to


regulate
 medical
 practice
 to
 ensure


patients
 are
 protected
 from
 substandard


care.


So
 let's
 talk
 about
 how
 the
 justices


respond
 to
 that
 argument.
 What
 did
 you


hear
 there?


I
 thought
 the
 most
 push
 back
 on
 the


therapist
 lawyer
 came
 from
 two
 of
 the


liberal
 justices,
 Justice
 Sonia


Sotomayor
 and
 Justice
 Katanji
 Brown


Jackson.
 I
 guess
 it
 seems
 very
 odd
 that


you
 could
 have
 two
 scenarios
 where
 you


have
 two
 licensed
 professionals
 both


attempting
 to
 provide
 treatment
 to
 an


individual
 say
 for
 the
 same
 issue
 that


you
 know
 the
 person
 says
 I'd
 like
 to


live
 consistently
 with
 my
 biological


sex.
 I
 feel
 that
 I
 I'm
 not
 doing
 that.


I'd
 like
 your
 help.
 Medical
 professional


A
 treats
 that
 quote
 unquote
 condition


with
 medication.
 medical
 professional
 B


treats
 that
 condition
 with
 talk
 therapy.


Justice
 Jackson
 in
 particular
 said
 she


was
 having
 trouble
 distinguishing
 speech


as
 a
 tool
 here
 to
 deliver
 the
 therapy


and
 said
 what's
 the
 difference
 between


that
 kind
 of
 tool
 and
 other
 tools


doctors
 use


and
 I
 guess
 under
 your
 theory
 those
 two


scenarios
 are
 sufficiently
 different


from
 a
 constitutional
 perspective
 that


one
 could
 be
 allowed
 and
 the
 other
 not.


I
 think
 that's
 potentially
 correct


because
 the
 first
 amendment
 would
 apply


to
 the
 speech


just
 because
 words
 are
 being
 used
 to


accomplish
 the
 therapy
 in
 one
 scenario


and
 not
 the
 other.


No,
 because
 only
 words
 are
 being
 used
 in


the
 one
 scenario.
 Again,
 if
 there
 is
 a


combination
 of
 words
 and
 conduct,
 I


think
 that
 takes
 us
 into
 a
 different


into
 a
 different
 realm.
 But
 one
 of
 the


what
 she's
 saying
 here
 is
 kind
 of
 like,


are
 you
 really
 arguing
 that
 therapists


aren't
 health
 care
 professionals?
 Is
 is


that
 the
 claim
 you're
 trying
 to
 make


that
 the
 therapy
 itself
 isn't,
 you
 know,


in
 and
 of
 itself
 a
 medical
 intervention


perspective?
 I'm
 wondering
 why
 this


regulation
 at
 issue
 here
 isn't
 really


just
 the
 functional
 equivalent
 of


scrametti.


And
 she
 brought
 up
 that
 just
 a
 few


months
 ago,
 the
 court's
 conservative


majority
 upheld
 a
 Tennessee
 law
 barring


certain
 medical
 treatments
 for


transgender
 young
 people
 that
 the
 state


had
 deemed
 unsafe.
 and
 she
 really


pressed
 the
 question
 of
 how
 is
 it


possible
 for
 us
 to
 say
 those
 types
 of


laws
 are
 okay
 but
 in
 this
 case
 Colorado


can't
 ban
 conversion
 therapy
 that
 it


thinks
 is
 harmful.


Well,
 from
 a
 very
 broad
 perspective


there
 shouldn't
 be
 equivalence
 because


obviously
 we
 have
 a
 first
 amendment.
 So


when
 you
 have


the
 key
 difference
 he
 says
 is
 that


Tennessee's
 law
 was
 dealing
 with


medication
 with
 drugs.
 Colorado's
 law
 is


dealing
 with
 the
 first
 amendment
 and


those
 speech
 concerns.
 So,
 two
 different


constitutional
 principles
 at
 play.


You
 know,
 it
 seems
 plausible
 to
 me
 that


legally
 these
 two
 things
 might
 be


treated
 distinctly.
 I
 mean,
 counseling


obviously
 can
 be
 a
 hugely
 important


intervention
 that
 has
 a
 big
 impact
 on


someone's
 mental
 health,
 but
 it
 seems


plausible
 that
 it
 would
 be
 seen


differently
 than
 taking
 medication
 or


doing
 an
 operation.
 And
 you
 can
 see
 a


slippery
 slope
 kind
 of
 concern
 here


where
 if
 you
 start,
 you
 know,
 regulating


the
 things
 that
 therapists
 say
 to
 their


patient,
 there
 could
 be
 a
 lot
 of


problems
 down
 the
 line,


right?
 And
 the
 lawyer
 for
 the
 therapist


said,


"Yet
 that
 would
 allow
 states
 to
 silence


all
 kinds
 of
 speech
 in
 the
 counseling


room,
 such
 as


allowing
 Colorado
 to
 bar
 this
 type
 of


treatment
 would
 open
 the
 door
 to
 laws


barring
 discussion
 of
 other
 things
 like


divorce
 or
 abortion."
 here.
 Colorado


can't
 satisfy
 any
 level
 of
 heightened


scrutiny.


So,
 the
 free
 speech
 aspect
 of
 the
 debate


was
 a
 big
 part
 of
 the
 argument
 on


Tuesday.
 And
 if
 the
 court
 decides
 that


this
 type
 of
 law
 is
 infringing
 on
 free


speech,
 it
 could
 send
 it
 back
 to
 the


lower
 courts.
 And
 then
 the
 key
 test
 will


be
 for
 the
 state
 to
 justify
 its
 law
 and


say
 the
 harm
 that
 comes
 from
 conversion


therapy
 justifies
 this
 infringement
 on


speech
 and
 that
 the
 law
 is
 designed


narrowly
 enough
 to
 make
 it
 worthwhile.


And
 Colorado
 can't
 prove
 harm
 because
 it


hasn't
 cited
 a
 study
 focusing
 on
 what's


at
 issue
 here.
 Voluntary
 speech
 between


a
 licensed
 professional
 and
 a
 minor.
 So


with
 this
 in
 mind,
 the
 petitioner's


lawyer
 then
 turns
 to
 the
 question
 of


harm.


Colorado
 certainly
 cites
 studies,
 but


those
 studies
 suffer
 from
 significant


flaws.
 The
 main


the
 therapist
 lawyer
 said
 the
 studies


are
 weak
 and
 biased.


They
 treat
 voluntary
 conversations
 the


same
 as
 shock
 therapy.


He
 said
 that
 the
 studies
 that
 Colorado


is
 relying
 on
 don't
 address
 the
 type
 of


voluntary
 talk
 therapy
 that
 she
 wants
 to


provide.
 He
 said
 there's
 no
 evidence


specifically
 about
 this
 type
 of
 therapy


that
 it's
 harmful.
 She
 should
 be
 able
 to


practice
 it
 with
 her
 clients.


And
 just
 to
 ask,
 is
 that
 true?
 There
 are


certainly
 people,
 right,
 who
 have
 said


this
 kind
 of
 therapy
 ruined
 their
 lives


or
 caused
 severe
 trauma.
 Well,
 major


medical
 associations
 like
 the
 American


Medical
 Association,
 the
 American


Psychological
 Association
 still
 say
 that


this
 is
 harmful.
 That
 conversations
 that


try
 to
 change
 what
 they
 say
 is


somebody's
 innate
 identity
 or
 sexual


orientation
 are
 harmful
 to
 young
 people.


But
 there
 is
 an
 emerging
 debate


especially
 around
 gender
 identity
 where


therapists
 are
 reconsidering
 the


possible
 benefits
 of
 this
 type
 of


therapy.


Scrutiny.


Thank
 you,
 Council.
 Uh,
 Justice
 Thomas,


just
 to
 summarize,
 the
 lawyers
 for
 the


therapist
 have
 basically
 said,
 "Look,


this
 case
 turns
 on
 this
 key
 issue
 of


whether
 this
 kind
 of
 therapy
 is
 speech


or
 medical
 care."
 And
 we
 say
 it's


speech.
 But
 even
 if
 you
 don't
 buy
 our


argument
 that
 it's
 speech,
 even
 if
 you


think
 it's
 medical
 care,
 well,
 there's


not
 enough
 evidence
 to
 say
 that
 the


medical
 care
 is
 harmful,
 that
 this
 is


causing
 harm,
 right?
 And
 despite
 some


tough
 questions
 from
 Justice
 Sodtomayor


and
 Justice
 Jackson,
 most
 of
 the
 court


seemed
 pretty
 receptive
 to
 the
 therapist


lawyers
 claims.
 Some
 of
 them
 didn't
 even


ask
 questions
 like
 Justice
 Brett


Kavanaaugh.


But
 then
 it
 was
 time
 for
 Colorado's


lawyer
 to
 stand
 up
 and
 try
 to
 make
 her


case
 and
 to
 try
 to
 convince
 them


otherwise.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[Music]


So,
 the
 Colorado
 lawyer
 steps
 up,
 as
 you


said,
 to
 make
 her
 case
 to
 these
 justices


who
 had
 overall
 been
 quite
 receptive
 to


the
 therapist's
 argument.
 Walk
 us


through
 what
 that
 lawyer
 said,
 Mr.
 Chief


Justice,
 and
 may
 I
 please
 the
 court?


Yes,
 it's
 two-pronged.
 This
 is
 the


solicitor
 general
 of
 Colorado.


Throughout
 its
 history,
 this
 court
 has


recognized
 that
 state
 power
 is
 at
 its


apex
 when
 it
 regulates
 to
 ensure
 safety


in
 the
 health
 care
 professions.


Colorado's
 law
 lies
 at
 the
 bullseye


center
 of
 this
 protection.


She
 says
 fundamentally
 this
 is
 not


speech.


The
 state
 cannot
 lose
 its
 power
 to


regulate
 the
 very
 professionals
 that
 it


licenses
 just
 because
 they
 are
 using


words.


These
 are
 licensed
 providers.
 It's


conduct.
 It's
 treatment.
 It's
 a
 clinical


conversation.
 And
 a
 state
 cannot
 be


required
 to
 let
 its
 vulnerable
 young


people
 waste
 their
 time
 and
 money
 on
 an


ineffective
 harmful
 treatment
 just


because
 that
 treatment
 is
 delivered


through
 words.


And
 then
 she
 says
 there
 is
 real
 harm.


There's
 lots
 of
 evidence
 from
 these


major
 medical
 associations.


The
 harms
 from
 conversion
 therapy
 come


from
 when
 you
 tell
 a
 young
 person,
 you


can
 change
 this
 innate
 thing
 about


yourself
 and
 they
 try
 and
 they
 try
 and


they
 fail
 and
 then
 they
 have
 shame
 and


they're
 miserable
 and
 then
 it
 ruins.


She's
 basically
 disagreeing
 with
 the
 two


main
 things
 that
 the
 therapist
 lawyer


says.
 She
 says
 this
 isn't
 speech,
 it's


medical
 care.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 it
 does


cause
 harm.


Right.
 And
 she
 says
 that's
 why
 so
 many


other
 states
 have
 also
 passed
 laws


barring
 conversion
 therapy.


And
 walk
 us
 through
 how
 the
 justices


respond
 to
 that
 because
 it
 sounds
 like


she's
 just
 saying
 the
 inverse
 of
 what


they
 heard.


Right.


If
 petitioner
 were
 a
 non-therapist,


would
 this
 be
 protected
 speech?
 Um
 well,


so
 I
 I
 wanted
 to
 mention


so
 Justice
 Thomas
 said,
 "Well,
 what


about
 other
 people
 who
 aren't
 licensed


therapists?
 Are
 they
 allowed
 to
 practice


conversion
 therapy?"


But
 the
 law
 exempts
 um
 religious


ministers
 and
 ministries
 from
 this.
 And


there
 was
 also
 a
 group
 of
 people
 called


life
 coaches
 who
 could
 perform
 this


therapy.


And
 in
 response,
 the
 lawyer
 from


Colorado
 says
 this
 law
 is
 narrow.
 She


says
 that
 there's
 an
 exemption
 for


religious
 ministries.
 They're
 not
 trying


to
 violate
 anybody's
 free
 speech
 rights.


that
 this
 is
 specifically
 about
 somebody


who
 has
 a
 license
 from
 the
 state
 and


that
 they
 get
 to
 set
 the
 standard
 for


what
 that
 practice
 looks
 like.


So
 what
 if
 someone
 who
 was
 happened
 to


be
 devoutly
 religious
 and
 actually


relied
 more
 on
 the
 minister
 than
 the


therapist?
 Uh
 it
 seemed
 that
 that
 person


would
 be
 equally
 dangerous.


He
 asked
 what
 about
 religious
 ministries


and
 life
 coaches?
 If
 this
 is
 such
 a


dangerous
 practice,
 why
 is
 it
 not
 banned


for
 those
 types
 of
 individuals?


dangerous.


Well,
 I
 think
 that
 that
 would
 be
 a


personal
 choice
 that
 they
 were
 making
 to


rely
 on
 their
 religious
 minister.
 It


wouldn't
 be
 a
 representation
 from
 the


state.
 If
 you
 go
 to
 a
 life
 coach
 or
 you


go
 to
 someone
 else,
 they're
 not
 licensed


by
 the
 state.
 You're
 not
 expecting
 them


to
 be
 complying
 with
 standards
 of
 care.


Um,
 you
 have
 a
 different
 expectation.


You
 know,
 I
 found
 this
 exchange
 really


interesting
 because
 on
 the
 one
 hand,
 the


lawyer
 for
 Colorado
 makes
 the
 law
 seem


narrow
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 the
 harm
 of


this
 to
 people
 who
 want
 to
 seek
 out
 this


kind
 of
 conversion
 therapy
 is
 actually


limited
 because
 they
 can
 get
 it
 if
 they


want
 it,
 just
 not
 from
 a
 therapist.
 But


on
 the
 other
 hand,
 the
 justices
 still


have
 to
 deal
 with
 that
 fundamental


question
 of
 whether
 it
 infringes
 on
 the


speech
 of
 the
 people
 it
 does
 apply
 to,


right?
 And
 that's
 what
 we
 heard
 from


some
 of
 the
 other
 justices
 who


questioned
 Colorado's
 lawyer.


I
 don't
 really
 see
 a
 a
 difference


between
 the
 argument
 that
 you're
 making


now
 and
 the
 argument
 that
 I
 thought
 we


rejected
 in
 NIFla.


So,
 Justice
 Alo
 had
 very
 pointed


questions
 for
 the
 Colorado
 attorney.


Let
 me
 put
 that
 aside
 and
 ask
 about
 your


interpretation
 of
 the
 statute.


And
 he
 did
 that
 by
 using
 a
 hypothetical.


Suppose
 an
 adolescent
 male
 comes
 to
 a


licensed
 therapist
 and
 says
 he's


attracted
 to
 other
 males
 but
 feels


uneasy
 and
 guilty
 about
 those
 feelings


and
 he
 wants
 the
 therapist's
 help
 so
 he


will
 feel
 comfortable.


He
 said
 if
 a
 young
 person
 comes
 to
 a


doctor
 and
 says
 that
 I
 identify
 as
 gay,


the
 law
 allows
 the
 therapist
 to
 help


that
 person
 affirm
 their
 sexual


orientation.


The
 other
 situation
 is
 uh
 a
 similar


adolescent
 male
 comes
 to
 a
 licensed


therapist
 says
 he's
 attracted
 to
 other


males
 and
 he
 wants
 to
 end
 or
 lessen
 them


and
 asks
 for
 the
 therapist's
 help
 in


doing
 so.


If
 a
 different
 teenager
 comes
 to
 a


doctor
 and
 says,
 "I
 identify
 as
 gay."


The
 doctor
 is
 not
 allowed
 to
 help
 that


teenager
 try
 to
 become
 straight.
 It


seems
 to
 me
 your
 statute
 dictates


opposite
 results
 in
 those
 two
 situations


based
 on
 the
 view
 based
 on
 the
 viewpoint


expressed
 one
 viewpoint.


So
 the
 law
 allows
 you
 to
 counsel
 in
 one


direction
 but
 not
 the
 other.
 And
 Justice


Alo
 seemed
 to
 be
 making
 the
 point
 that


this
 is
 sort
 of
 a
 classic
 type
 of
 law


that
 the
 first
 amendment
 prohibits.


Basically,
 Alito's
 point
 here
 is
 the


therapist
 in
 this
 case
 can
 tell
 a


patient
 to
 lean
 into
 their
 gay
 identity,


but
 can't
 tell
 them
 to
 change
 it.
 And


that's
 discriminating
 based
 on
 the
 point


of
 view
 of
 the
 speech
 in
 question,
 which


the
 government
 can't
 do,
 right?
 When
 the


government
 does
 that,
 it's
 very
 suspect


and
 maybe
 in
 violation
 of
 the
 First


Amendment.
 And
 that
 led
 to
 one
 of
 the


most
 surprising
 and
 really
 telling


moments
 of
 the
 argument.
 I
 I
 guess
 I
 had


the
 same
 kind
 of
 question
 that
 Justice


Alto
 had.
 I
 mean,
 if
 we
 assume,
 for


example,


liberal
 justice
 Elena
 Kagan
 kind
 of


leaned
 into
 Justice
 Alto's
 question
 and


said,
 you
 know,
 I
 have
 the
 same


question.


If
 a
 doctor
 says,
 I
 know
 you
 identify
 as


gay
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 help
 you
 accept


that.
 And
 another
 doctor
 says,
 I
 know


you
 identify
 as
 gay
 and
 I'm
 going
 to


help
 you
 to
 change
 that.
 and
 one
 of


those
 is
 permissible
 and
 the
 other
 is


not.
 That
 seems
 like
 viewpoint


discrimination
 in
 the
 way
 we
 would


normally
 understand
 viewpoint


discrimination.


And
 it
 does
 seem
 like
 a
 classic
 example


of
 discrimination
 by
 government


officials
 based
 on
 the
 viewpoint
 being


expressed
 um
 that
 would
 normally
 be


subject
 to
 a
 high
 level
 of
 judicial


review.
 And
 in
 response
 to
 Justice


Kagan,
 Colorado's
 lawyer
 says,
 "I


I
 don't
 disagree
 with
 that,
 Justice


Kagan,
 and
 that's
 why
 medical
 treatment


has
 to
 be
 treated
 differently."


You're
 right.
 Um,
 we
 are
 picking
 sides


in
 this
 debate
 because
 one
 type
 of


treatment
 is
 harmful
 and
 that's
 why


speech
 is
 different
 from
 treatment.
 Um,


the
 state
 is
 trying
 to
 protect
 young


people
 from
 a
 harmful
 practice.
 And
 so,


we
 are
 saying
 that
 you're
 not
 allowed
 to


practice
 conversion
 therapy.
 Um,
 that's


by
 design.
 And
 what
 about
 the
 Colorado


lawyer's
 argument
 that
 this
 care
 does


cause
 harm?
 How
 do
 the
 justices
 deal


with
 that?


Right.
 So
 there
 was
 another
 pointed


question
 from
 Justice
 Amy
 Coney
 Barrett


who
 is
 often
 the
 swing
 vote
 and
 in
 the


majority.


Justice
 Barrett,


what
 is
 your
 best
 evidence
 on
 this


record
 that
 this
 kind
 of
 talk
 therapy
 by


a
 licensed
 professional,
 licensed


therapist
 to
 minors
 causes
 harm?


Sure.
 I
 would
 direct.
 and
 she
 said,
 "You


know,
 what
 is
 your
 best
 answer
 to
 how


this
 actually
 causes
 harm?"


The
 Green
 study
 looked
 at
 34,000
 13
 to


25
 year olds
 who
 had
 gone
 through


conversion
 therapy
 and
 after
 controlling


for
 other
 factors
 found
 there
 was
 a
 two


times
 rate
 of
 attempted
 suicides
 among


that
 group.


And
 the
 Colorado
 lawyer
 again
 pointed
 to


major
 medical
 associations
 and
 studies


over
 many
 years.
 He
 looked
 specifically


at
 childhood
 exposure
 and
 found


association
 with
 adverse
 mental
 health


outcomes
 in
 adulthood,


saying
 that
 this
 can
 lead
 to
 increased


risk
 for
 depression
 and
 suicide
 and
 said


there's
 real
 harm
 here
 for
 young
 people.


Justice,


your
 argument
 depends
 very
 heavily
 on


the
 standard
 of
 care
 which
 I
 take
 it
 is


defined
 by
 the
 medical
 cons
 by
 a
 medical


consensus.
 Is
 that
 correct?
 And
 even
 as


she's
 talking
 about
 um
 all
 of
 these


studies,
 there
 is
 skepticism
 um
 from


conservative
 justices
 like
 Samuel
 Alo.


But
 have
 there
 been
 times
 when
 the


medical
 consensus
 has
 been
 politicized,


has
 been
 taken
 over
 by
 ideology


who
 asked
 pointedly,
 can
 medical


consensus
 be
 wrong?
 Was
 there
 once
 was


there
 a
 time
 when
 many
 medical


professionals
 thought
 that
 certain


people
 should
 not
 be
 permitted
 to


procreate
 because
 they
 had
 low
 IQs?


So,
 he
 brings
 up
 a
 time
 in
 the
 1920s


when
 medical
 professionals
 thought
 that


certain
 people
 should
 not
 be
 permitted


to
 procreate.


Um,
 we
 have
 no
 facts
 about
 that
 in
 this


case,
 but
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 disagree
 that


that's
 possible.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 a


really


Isn't
 it
 a
 fact
 that
 it's
 happened
 in


the
 past?
 And
 he
 quotes
 from
 the
 court's


majority
 opinion
 back
 in
 1927
 which


upheld
 that
 sterilization
 program


written
 by
 Justice
 Oliver
 Wendell
 Holmes


who
 said


three
 generations
 of
 idiots
 are
 enough.


Wasn't
 it
 better
 for
 all
 the
 world


because
 three
 generations
 of
 imbeciles


are
 enough.


He's
 saying
 look
 scientific
 consensus


has
 been
 wrong
 before.
 That
 suggests
 it


could
 be
 wrong
 again
 and
 we
 shouldn't


rest
 our
 law
 on
 that.


Right.
 Right.
 And
 Justice
 Gorsuch
 makes


the
 same
 point
 that
 medical
 consensus
 in


the
 1970s
 said
 that
 homosexuality
 was
 a


mental
 illness.


What
 if
 a
 state
 back
 then
 passed
 a
 law


prohibiting
 talk
 therapy
 that
 affirmed


homosexuality?
 Would
 that
 be
 subject
 to


It's
 interesting
 because
 the
 things
 that


they're
 pointing
 to
 are
 really


horrifying
 moments
 in
 our
 legal
 and


scientific
 history.
 I
 mean,
 do
 you
 think


that
 this
 line
 of
 questioning
 from
 the


conservatives
 suggests
 that
 the
 justices


that
 the
 court
 doesn't
 trust
 scientific


consensus
 anymore?
 Well,
 I
 think
 Justice


Alo
 was
 pretty
 clear
 that
 medical


consensus
 can
 be
 very
 important.
 He
 says


it's
 usually
 very
 reasonable,
 but
 he
 did


point
 out
 there
 have
 been
 times
 when


medical
 consensus
 has
 been
 politicized


or
 colored
 by
 ideology.
 I
 do
 think
 it's


interesting
 that
 we're
 in
 this
 moment


again
 where
 the
 court
 is
 dealing
 with


this
 intersection
 of
 the
 law
 and


science.
 Um
 we
 saw
 this
 last
 term
 when


they
 took
 on
 the
 case
 involving
 gender


affirming
 care
 for
 minors
 in
 Tennessee.


Um
 and
 I
 think
 that
 it
 is
 going
 to
 keep


coming
 back
 to
 the
 court
 and
 it's


something
 that
 they
 need
 to
 wrestle


with.


Gender
 dysphoria.


Thank
 you
 councel.
 The
 case
 is


submitted.


Okay.
 So
 given
 how
 these
 oral
 arguments


played
 out
 this
 week,
 what
 do
 you
 think


is
 going to
 happen
 in
 this
 case?


I
 saw
 two
 paths
 emerging
 from
 the


argument.
 One,
 the
 court
 could
 decide
 to


send
 this
 back
 to
 the
 lower
 court
 and


say,
 "You
 got
 it
 wrong
 the
 first
 time.


This
 is
 infringing
 on
 free
 speech
 and


you
 have
 to
 apply
 a
 higher
 level
 of


scrutiny
 to
 the
 law
 and
 see
 if
 it's


really
 justified."
 The
 other
 would
 be


the
 court
 just
 saying
 that
 it's


unconstitutional
 and
 striking
 it
 down
 on


its
 own.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 part
 of
 the


equation
 will
 be
 does
 Justice
 Kagan
 or


even
 one
 of
 the
 other
 liberals
 join
 with


the
 majority?
 Um,
 and
 in
 that
 case,
 I


could
 see
 them
 sending
 it
 back
 to
 the


lower
 court.


And
 from
 the
 way
 that
 you've
 described


these
 arguments,
 it
 does
 seem
 clear
 that


this
 case
 is
 actually
 very
 nuanced
 and


there
 were
 plenty
 of
 issues
 with
 the
 law


that
 could
 be
 debated
 on
 their
 legal


merits.
 And
 yet,
 because
 of
 the
 nature


of
 the
 case,
 the
 politicized
 moment
 that


we're
 in,
 and
 and
 the
 court's
 recent


history
 of
 ruling
 in
 favor
 of
 a
 bunch
 of


conservative
 causes,
 it
 doesn't
 seem


like
 a
 stretch
 to
 say
 that
 this
 will
 be


perceived
 as
 the
 court
 again
 pushing


forward
 the
 conservative
 culture
 war


agenda.
 Both
 sides
 I
 could
 see,


interpreting
 it
 that
 way.
 And
 I
 wonder


if
 you
 see
 a
 world
 in
 which
 conservative


legal
 activists
 jump
 on
 this
 to
 push
 the


shift
 in
 the
 legal
 landscape
 even


further
 in
 the
 direction
 they
 want.
 I


think
 it
 depends
 on
 how
 the
 court
 ends


up
 ruling.
 I
 mean
 if
 it's
 a
 six
 to3


decision
 divided
 along
 ideological
 lines


that's
 certainly
 a
 a
 real
 signal
 there.


If
 one
 of
 the
 liberal
 justices
 does
 join


and
 we
 get
 a
 narrower
 decision,
 that


would,
 you
 know,
 show
 that
 the
 court
 is


not
 as
 ideologically
 divided,
 but


certainly
 it
 fits
 into
 the
 pattern
 of


what
 we've
 seen
 from
 this
 court
 in


recent
 years.


It
 was
 just
 5
 years
 ago
 that
 the
 court


actually
 expanded
 rights
 for
 gay
 and


transgender
 workers,
 but
 ever
 since


then,
 they've
 been
 slowly
 moving
 in
 this


other
 direction.
 As
 we've
 talked
 about


the
 case
 involving
 trans
 care
 for


minors,
 there's
 another
 case
 last
 term


where
 the
 justices
 said
 religious


families
 could
 pull
 their
 children
 from


story
 time
 in
 public
 schools
 that
 used


books
 with
 LGBTQ
 themed
 characters.
 And


there's
 questions
 about
 whether
 it
 could


go
 even
 further.
 Will
 there
 be
 a


reopening
 of
 the
 gay
 marriage
 case?


Wow.
 So,
 we're
 seeing
 the
 justices


continuously
 not
 shy
 away
 from
 these
 big


cultural
 war
 issues,
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


looking
 to
 see
 how
 they
 respond
 to
 these


cases
 from
 conservative
 activists
 that


have
 the
 potential
 to
 reshape
 the


country.


[Music]


And
 thanks
 so
 much.


Thank
 you.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[Music]


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know.


Today,
 Israel
 and
 Hamas
 have
 reached
 an


agreement
 for
 the
 release
 of
 Israeli


hostages
 in
 exchange
 for
 Palestinian


prisoners.
 a
 breakthrough
 that
 could
 be


a
 crucial
 step
 toward
 an
 end
 to
 the


two-year
 war
 in
 Gaza.
 President
 Trump,


who
 helped
 broker
 the
 deal,
 said
 on


social
 media
 on
 Wednesday
 that
 both


sides
 had
 agreed
 to
 the
 first
 phase
 of


the
 White
 House's
 peace
 plan.
 He
 said


all
 Israeli
 hostages
 would
 be
 released


and
 that
 Israel
 would
 pull
 back
 its


troops
 to
 an
 agreed
 upon
 line.


The
 world
 has
 come
 together
 around
 this


deal
 and
 that's
 something
 I
 would
 say


that
 without
 that
 uh
 wouldn't
 happen.
 In


an
 interview
 on
 Fox
 News
 Wednesday


night,
 Trump
 said
 the
 hostages
 would


probably
 be
 returned
 on
 Monday
 and
 said


the
 deal
 would
 bring
 peace
 to
 the
 whole


region.
 You
 know,
 many
 years
 they
 talked


about
 peace
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.
 This
 is


more
 than
 Gaza.
 This
 is
 peace
 in
 the


Middle
 East.
 And
 it's
 an
 incredible


thing.


But
 many
 of
 the
 specifics
 of
 the


agreement
 remained
 unclear.
 Trump's


announcement
 came
 at
 7:00
 p.m.
 Eastern


on
 Wednesday
 night,
 2:00
 a.m.
 Thursday


in
 Israel.
 Prime
 Minister
 Benjamin


Netanyahu
 said
 that
 he
 had
 spoken
 with


Trump
 and
 would
 convene
 his
 government


on
 Thursday
 to
 sign
 off
 on
 the


agreement,
 but
 Israel's
 initial


statements
 didn't
 mention
 a
 troop


withdrawal.


Hamas
 said
 in
 a
 statement
 that
 the


agreement
 would
 lead
 to
 the
 end
 of
 the


war
 in
 Gaza
 and
 Israel's
 withdrawal
 from


the
 territory.


And
 earlier
 on
 Wednesday,
 President


Trump
 said
 that
 Governor
 JB
 Pritsker
 of


Illinois
 and
 Mayor
 Brandon
 Johnson
 of


Chicago
 should
 be
 jailed,
 writing
 on


social
 media
 that
 they
 hadn't
 done


enough
 to
 protect
 ICE
 officers.
 Both


Democrats
 have
 opposed
 Trump's


deployment
 of
 National
 Guard
 troops
 in


the
 Chicago
 area
 and
 criticized
 the


administration's
 aggressive
 immigration


raids.
