- No matter what their gods were,
what they did for a
living, what they wore,
the songs they sang,
everything varies except love,
and everybody loves.
So I became convinced that
this was a real thing,
that we were built somehow
to form partnerships.
And then the day came
when I thought to myself,
"Well, then it must be
something in the brain."
(light thoughtful music)
- [Narrator] The science of romantic love.
- I really began by wondering
why we bother to pair up at all.
97% of mammals do not pair up; people do.
So I thought that might be quite easy.
And I looked at the Demographic Yearbooks
of the United Nations, and in
every culture in the world,
and not only around the world today
but historically, traditional societies,
hunter-gathering societies,
every single culture in the
world has some mechanism
for people to form some
sort of partnership
to rear their babies as a team.
And so I really started
by looking at the Demographic Yearbooks
of the United Nations,
reading over 90 ethnographic studies
of hunter-gatherers and agrarian peoples
and herding peoples, et cetera.
And I just kept seeing the same pattern.
And I remember I was walking
along in Greenwich Village;
it was about three o'clock
on a weekday afternoon,
and I suddenly thought to myself,
"These three brain
systems must have evolved:
sex drive, feelings of
intense romantic love,
and feelings of attachment."
I remember even where I was standing.
And I thought maybe if I could put people
into a brain scanner, I could
find the basic brain pathways,
the basic brain circuitry
of these three basic brain systems.
A lot of people have
studied the sex drive.
I didn't need to study that.
We know some of the genes,
we know some of the hormones,
we know the pathways really.
I mean, (laughs) to some extent certainly.
But quite a bit about the sex drive.
So I felt that it was
more important for me
to study romantic love and
feelings of attachment.
And I focused on romantic love
because people really do think
it's part of the supernatural.
Most people don't kill
themselves over an attachment.
They kill themselves over romantic love.
I mean, it is such a powerful brain system
that I thought to myself,
"If I can figure out what's
happening in the brain,
maybe I can help people understand this
and, in fact, maybe not
even kill themselves
when they are rejected."
Nobody gets out of love alive.
We all suffer.
Some people suffer more than others.
Some people respond very dramatically,
and some people can get
over it relatively quickly.
But nobody gets out of love alive.
We all have disappointments.
It's such a powerful brain system.
I mean, everywhere in the world.
It's very interesting
because, you know, I was talking to a man,
an anthropologist, who
studies the people in China.
This was many years ago.
And he said, "Oh, the
Chinese don't love." (laughs)
Well, he didn't read any of
their love poetry. (laughs)
Everywhere in the world, there's
poetry and songs and dances
and dramas that express love.
So he went back to China,
and he said to his assistant,
who was Chinese, he said,
"Well, I mean, in China they don't love."
And the assistant broke
down, started crying,
and said, "I have a woman
who doesn't love me.
I don't know what I'm gonna do."
And that sent him on to
studying romantic love in China.
And when you look around the
world, I mean, the poetry.
You know, a lot of
anthropologists study potsherds
or post holes or arrowheads
or all kinds of more sophisticated things.
But I really like to read poetry
because I think it's a basic artifact
of this basic brain system.
And it always says the same thing.
I remember one poem by a Chinese person,
and it was something like this.
It was something like, you know,
"I cannot bear to put away
the bamboo sleeping mat.
The night I brought you home,
I watched you roll it out."
Even the things that a
lover touches in your house
acquire meaning.
The brain acquires meaning to anything
that has to do with
romance and attachment.
It's so profoundly basic to who we are.
Because if you don't love
and you don't attach,
you don't have babies,
and you don't send your DNA into tomorrow.
And from a Darwinian
perspective, you lose.
It's very interesting.
People don't think that
other animals love.
I've really looked at
a lot of other animals,
and they do love.
They do form romantic, I
call it animal magnetism
or animal romance.
And you can see a rat
suddenly feel a very intense
interest in another rat,
only lasts for about 30 seconds.
In elephants, it lasts
for about five days.
In foxes, it can last a long time.
But most animals don't form a partnership.
They feel that intense attraction,
animal attraction, animal magnetism.
And we now know that that attraction
is basically the same brain system
as our brain system of
feelings of romantic love.
So other animals love.
Darwin said that other animals love.
He even thought that
butterflies felt that attraction
and that this was sort of,
oh, a primordial beginning
of this attraction system that
became incredibly elaborate
in the human animal.
But why is it that we bother to pair up?
All kinds of other animals feel romance,
but it doesn't last very long.
In humans, it can last
months or years, actually.
We've been able to
prove that romantic love
can last many years.
I think that the brain circuitry
for human romantic love
and feelings of deep attachment
evolved probably 4.4 million years ago.
Our ancestors were being
forced out of the trees.
They were gonna have to
come down onto the ground
because the trees were disappearing
and move through very
dangerous open grasslands
to another group of trees
and collect what they could on the ground
before they went to eat in a
place unmolested by predators.
And with the beginning of carrying
sticks and stones to protect
themselves and food to eat,
they began to have to walk
on two legs instead of four.
Chimpanzees walk on four legs,
and they've got their baby on their back.
We began to have to walk up
on two legs instead of four,
which meant that females began
to have to carry their babies
in their arms instead of on their backs.
Now, how is a four-million-year-old female
gonna have to carry the equivalent
of a 20-pound bowling ball in one arm
and sticks and stones in the other
and protect and feed herself?
She began to need a partner
to help protect her while she moved along.
And how could a male,
four million years ago,
protect a whole group of females?
He could protect one.
And so we went over what I
call the monogamy threshold,
a threshold in which the
female needed a partner
to help her raise her baby,
at least through infancy.
And males needed to
protect at least one female
with his DNA in her.
And, of course, you know,
females needed a male who
wanted to stick around.
Those that didn't stick
around didn't have the babies
and didn't pass their DNA onto you and me,
leaving in the human creature
today, both men and women,
with a tremendous
capacity to fall in love,
form a partnership, and raise
their children as a team.
So the bottom line is, along with that,
we began to evolve our
human brain pathways
for human romantic love and
feelings of deep attachment.
So I began to believe that
if I looked into the brain,
I could find the brain
circuitry of romantic love.
So I assembled a team
and began to put people in the scanner.
And the issue was how to scan the brain.
And what I ended up with
is the following protocol
or research design.
They would look at a
picture of their sweetheart
that called forth the wonderful
feelings of romantic love.
And they would also look at a photograph
of somebody who called forth no emotions,
no positive or negative emotions.
The problem with that
is when you're madly
in love with somebody,
your emotions are gonna bleed
from one picture to the other.
So I had to relax the brain
between looking at the neutral,
the positive, and the neutral.
So I used a very standard
psychological distraction task.
I would cast on the screen
a large number like 4,821,
and I would ask them for 30 seconds
to look at that photograph,
that picture, and that number,
and count backwards in
increments of seven.
Now, even mathematicians
take some time to count
in increments of seven.
It takes all the blood
away from brain regions
linked with romantic love
to brain regions linked with
just simply counting backwards.
So this way, they would bring a photograph
of their sweetheart into the lab.
They would bring a neutral photograph,
somebody from the office
who they barely knew,
somebody from the dry cleaners,
some past friend of somebody
who called forth no positive
or negative feelings.
So they would look at
those two photographs.
They would look at their sweetheart,
then they would count backwards.
Then they would look at the neutral,
then they would count backwards.
So it was: positive, count
back, neutral, count back.
A cycle of six times,
12 times, looking at these photographs.
That way, we were able to
capture through the fMRI machine
how you felt when you have experienced
that intense feeling of romantic love,
what you were doing in the brain
when you were counting backwards,
and how you felt when
you were simply looking
at the neutral photograph.
And when you put the neutral
and the romantic love on top of each other
and cancel out what they have in common,
you're left with what's
going on in the brain
when you're madly in love.
I'll never forget the first moment
that I looked at our data.
I felt as if I was looking back
to over four million years ago
when this brain system evolved.
And what we saw was activity
in a tiny little factory
near the base of the brain
called the ventral tegmental area.
It's a brain region that
actually makes dopamine,
a natural stimulant, and
gives you that focus,
that motivation, the craving,
the elation of intense romantic love.
And, in fact, I was really surprised.
I had thought we would
find all kinds of data,
oh, linked with the emotions
and linked with cognitive
thinking processes.
We did find data linked
with thinking processes
and the emotions.
But no two people were
alike, which is obvious;
they'd be thinking about somebody else.
But they all showed activity
in this little factory
near the base of the brain.
And I had thought that
romantic love was an emotion
or a series of emotions, but
what it really is is a drive,
a basic mating drive that
evolved millions of years ago
to enable you to focus your mating energy
on a single individual and
start the mating process.
As a matter of fact, we now
call it a survival mechanism.
The basic brain region
that generates the dopamine
and gives you that
feeling of romantic love
lies right next to the factory
that orchestrates thirst
and hunger.
Thirst and hunger keep you alive today.
Romantic love enables you
to focus your mating energy
and drive your DNA into tomorrow.
So it's a basic survival mechanism
that evolved millions of
years ago, came out of nature,
came out of other animals that feel it,
but nowhere near to that degree.
As a matter of fact,
I think all three of these
brain systems evolved in tandem.
The sex drive evolved to get you out there
looking for a whole range of partners.
I mean, you can have sex with somebody
when you're not in love with them.
Romantic love evolved to enable you
to focus your mating energy
on just one at a time.
And attachment, that third brain system,
evolved to enable you to
stick with this person
at least long enough
to raise a single child through infancy.
I was absolutely positive it
was not a supernatural event.
And so, no, I did not think about
that person at that moment.
But I have been determined
to show the world
that this is real.
So many people suffer from it.
And as a matter of fact, you
know, a lot of people came
and wanted to talk to me, a
lot of journalists, et cetera,
after we discovered this data.
And I thought to myself at
the time, "You know, Helen,
this really isn't very important."
You know, when you're madly
in love with the right person,
there's no problem.
The real problem is when
you've been rejected in love.
That's when you turn into a pest,
not only for all your friends and family,
but it's a dangerous situation.
So I thought to myself,
"Now what I've got to do
is put people into the machine
who've been rejected in love.
That's where I can make a
contribution to humanity."
Well, then, my next study
was putting people into the brain scanner
who had just been rejected in love.
That was a lot harder because, you know,
before I put people in this brain scanner,
you really talk to them for a long time.
You've gotta make sure
that they are madly in love
or that they are rejected in love
because these machines are expensive,
and it's extremely time-consuming.
And I also have to tell them
what's gonna go on in the machine.
I've got to get them to
bring me the correct pictures
so it triggers the right
response in the brain.
So I have long discussions
with all of our subjects,
our participants, before
I put them in the machine.
And when you've been rejected in love,
one girl didn't show up for the scanning.
She had not been out of
bed for almost four days.
Another person cried
so hard in the machine
that we couldn't use the data.
She moved too much.
Another person, after the scanning,
came out of the machine and was so angry
that he went home and,
you know, drank too much.
And so I began to realize very early,
now I'm playing with
something that is so powerful
that I began to make sure that
I walk with them for a while
after the scan was over,
that I called them that evening
and the following morning
to make sure that
everything was all right.
This is when people kill themselves.
This is when people kill somebody else.
This is when they stalk.
This is when they cry all night.
This is when they can slip
into clinical depression.
So I thought it was an
extremely important study.
I still think it is.
And I was determined to see
whether rejection in love
was actually an addiction.
I had even thought that
happy love was an addiction
because, you know, when
you're madly in love,
you'll do the craziest things.
And sure enough, I was able to put 15 men
and women into the scanner
who had just been dumped.
I was able to find activity
in a lot of brain regions.
One brain region is that same
basic ventral tegmental area,
the VTA, that pumps out the dopamine
that gives them the feeling
of intense dramatic love.
Also found activity in a brain region
linked with deep feelings of attachment.
You don't stop loving somebody
when they've dumped you.
I found activity in a brain
region linked with pain,
with physical pain.
It is a brain region
that also becomes active
when you have a toothache.
The difference between a
toothache and intense rejection
is the toothache goes away
after you get to the dentist.
And with rejection in love,
you can feel that pain
for months, maybe sometimes years.
But most important, I found
activity in three brain regions
linked with craving and
addiction specifically.
And what I was looking for
is activity in a brain region
called the nucleus accumbens.
It's the basic brain
region that becomes active
when you are addicted to cocaine,
heroin, booze, alcohol,
cigarettes, gambling,
all of the addictions.
And so I was able to
prove that romantic love
when you are rejected is an addiction.
It is a love addiction.
Then we went back,
and we were able to find
that people who were madly
and happily in love were also addicted.
We also found activity in
this basic brain region,
the nucleus accumbens.
So I'm trying to get
the world to understand
how important this brain system is.
You know, it's so interesting,
some psychologists, you know,
you'll go in and they'll say,
"Well, just get rid of him.
You know, he beats you up.
Just get rid of him."
And they don't really
realize that this person
might not be able to get rid of them.
As a matter of fact,
I really believe in many
of the principles of AA,
Alcoholics Anonymous,
and I do think that we need to treat
this particular addiction
as a very special addiction
with very special therapies.
