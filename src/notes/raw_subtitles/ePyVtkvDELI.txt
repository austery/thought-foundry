I'm
 Rosie
 Garin
 and
 you're
 listening
 to


the
 Wire
 Cutter
 Show.


[Music]


Hey
 there,
 it's
 Christine.
 This
 week
 on


the
 show,
 we're
 talking
 about
 how
 to
 get


the
 best
 deals
 on
 travel.
 Seeing
 new


places
 can
 be
 incredibly
 fun,


mindexpanding,
 and
 fulfilling.
 It
 can


also
 be
 really,
 really
 expensive.
 So,


we're
 talking
 about
 how
 to
 do
 it
 all
 for


less.
 Earlier
 this
 week,
 we
 dropped
 an


episode
 with
 Elaine
 Glusac,
 who
 writes


the
 New
 York
 Times
 column
 The
 Frugal


Traveler,
 about
 her
 best
 tips
 for


getting
 great
 deals
 on
 travel.
 To
 round


out
 that
 conversation,
 we're
 going
 to


drop
 a
 bonus
 episode
 today
 about
 some
 of


the
 best
 ways
 to
 use
 credit
 card
 points


to
 augment
 a
 travel
 budget.


Wire
 Cutter
 does
 not
 cover
 credit
 cards


anymore,
 at least
 we
 used
 to.
 We
 do


cover
 a
 variety
 of
 travel
 gear,
 and
 we


have
 a
 ton
 of
 advice
 on
 how
 to
 shop
 for


gear
 in
 a
 smart
 way.
 But
 when
 it
 comes


to
 a
 travel
 budget,
 the
 flights
 and


hotels
 are
 what
 really
 add
 up.
 And


credit
 card
 rewards
 points
 can
 play
 a


really
 big
 role
 in
 making
 travel
 more


affordable.
 This
 kind
 of
 travel
 hacking,


using
 credit
 card
 points
 for
 flights
 and


hotels,
 can
 seem
 a
 little
 complicated


and
 maybe
 even
 problematic
 if
 it
 lands


you
 in
 debt.
 It's
 a
 financial
 decision


with
 inherent
 risks.


To
 help
 demystify
 this
 topic,
 we're


inviting
 an
 expert
 on
 the
 show
 who
 knows


a
 lot
 about
 it,
 Brian
 Kelly.
 You
 may


know
 Kelly
 by
 the
 moniker
 he
 shares
 with


the
 popular
 website
 he
 founded,
 The


Points
 Sky.
 Kelly
 remains
 part
 owner
 of


that
 business,
 though
 today
 the
 majority


stake
 belongs
 to
 media
 company
 Red


Ventures.
 Since
 it
 started
 in
 2010,
 the


Points
 Sky
 website
 has
 become
 an


authority
 on
 how
 to
 access
 and
 leverage


loyalty
 programs,
 credit
 card
 and


airline
 miles,
 and
 of
 course,
 points
 for


travel.
 Brian
 published
 a
 book
 back
 in


February
 called
 How
 to
 Win
 at
 Travel


with
 tons
 of
 tips
 and
 tricks
 on


navigating
 the
 world
 of
 points.
 In
 a


minute,
 Rosie
 is
 going
 to
 talk
 with


Brian
 about
 how
 to
 use
 credit
 card


rewards
 programs
 most
 effectively
 and


the
 pitfalls
 to
 avoid.
 We'll
 be
 right


back.

Before
 we
 get
 back
 into
 the
 episode,
 I


want
 to
 ask
 you
 for
 a
 quick
 favor.


You've
 heard
 us
 say
 this
 before,
 but
 the


holiday
 season
 is
 sort
 of
 wire
 cutter


Super
 Bowl.
 The
 team
 goes
 hard
 to
 help


you
 figure
 out
 the
 best
 ways
 to
 host,


cook,
 gift,
 and
 more.
 We
 love
 it
 and
 we


love
 hearing
 from
 you,
 our
 listeners.


This
 year,
 we're
 planning
 an
 extra


special
 gift
 giving
 miniseries
 and
 I


want
 to
 know
 what
 you
 need
 help
 with


when
 it
 comes
 to
 gifting.
 Is
 there


someone
 in
 your
 life
 that's
 really
 hard


to
 please?
 Are
 you
 wondering
 what
 the


youths
 are
 looking
 for
 this
 holiday


season?
 You
 and
 me
 both.
 Are
 you


struggling
 with
 gift
 giving
 etiquette?


Are
 you
 wanting
 to
 gift
 with
 the


constraints
 of
 a
 budget?
 We
 want
 to
 hear


from
 you.
 So,
 record
 a
 voice
 memo
 on


your
 phone
 and
 tell
 us
 your
 first
 name,


where
 you're
 calling
 from,
 and
 what
 your


gifting
 question
 is.
 If
 it's
 about


someone
 in
 particular,
 give
 us
 as
 much


detail
 as
 you
 can.
 That'll
 really
 help


us.
 Then,
 email
 it
 to
 us
 at
 thewire


cuttershow@wirecutter.com.


Again,
 you
 can
 send
 your
 voice
 memo
 to


the
 wire
 cutter
 showcutter.com


and
 your
 question
 may
 wind
 up
 getting


answered
 on
 the
 show.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much.


Welcome
 back,
 Brian.
 Welcome
 to
 the


show.
 So
 happy
 to
 have
 you
 here.


Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 focus
 this
 episode
 on


a
 discussion
 of
 basics
 for
 maximizing


points
 for
 travel
 and
 how
 to
 do
 that


with
 everyday
 purchases.
 Before
 we
 get


into
 that,
 many
 listeners
 are
 probably


familiar
 with
 the
 name
 of
 the
 site,
 but


maybe
 not
 the
 person
 behind
 the
 Oz


behind
 the
 the
 curtain.
 So
 talk
 to
 me


about
 your
 origin
 and
 I
 remember
 hearing


that
 it
 had
 something
 to
 do
 with
 a


family
 trip
 to
 the
 Caribbean,
 but
 give


me
 the
 give
 me
 give
 me
 the
 the
 story.


So
 there
 is
 a
 point
 sky
 pin.
 Yes,
 it's


me.
 Um,
 so
 I
 started
 the
 points
 guy
 15


years
 ago,
 but
 my
 real
 points
 origin


story
 was
 in
 1995.
 I
 was
 always
 the


computer
 wiz
 in
 my
 house.
 I
 was
 the
 AOL


hacker.
 I
 had
 prodigy
 internet,
 you


know,
 dialup
 early
 90s.
 And
 my
 dad
 had


gotten
 a
 job
 for
 a
 startup.
 And
 so
 he


started
 working
 from
 home
 as
 an


executive
 and
 he
 had
 to
 book
 his
 own


travel.
 So
 my
 first
 job
 really
 was


booking
 his
 travel
 on
 Travel
 Velocity.
 I


was
 a
 little
 travel
 agent.
 I
 was
 just


obsessed
 with
 the
 internet.
 And
 one
 day


he
 said
 he
 he
 had
 all
 these
 freaking


flyer
 miles,
 but
 they
 were
 split
 up


between
 US
 Air
 and
 American.
 So
 he's


like, "We
 can't
 all
 go
 somewhere
 because


it's
 two
 different
 programs."
 And
 I
 was


12
 years
 old.


And
 I
 said,
 "Give
 me
 a
 beat."
 And
 I


called
 the
 airlines.
 And
 here's
 a
 tip,


everyone.
 and
 this
 still
 works
 in
 2025


is
 be
 nice
 to
 phone
 agents.
 The
 phone


agents
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 power.
 I
 figured


out
 a
 way
 and
 I'm
 one
 of
 four
 kids.
 So,


my
 parents,
 we
 grew
 up
 very,
 my
 parents


are
 humbled.
 They
 were
 not
 jet
 setters,


you
 know,
 but
 I
 always
 had
 an
 urge
 to


travel
 the
 world.
 So,
 I
 was
 able
 to
 use


all
 of
 our
 points.
 In
 1996,
 we
 went
 to


Grand
 Cayman
 and
 we
 took
 this
 trip
 for


peanuts
 and
 then
 that
 became
 a
 yearly


thing
 in
 the
 '9s.
 So
 my
 dad
 and
 I
 were


doing
 the
 points
 game
 because
 it's
 a


game
 and
 it's
 still
 a
 game
 to
 this
 day.


The
 game
 has
 changed
 fundamentally,
 but


the
 game
 can
 still
 be
 won
 for
 sure.


It's
 amazing
 they
 were
 open
 to
 letting


you
 fly.


At
 age
 12,


metaphorically
 at
 age
 12,
 we
 laugh.


We're
 like,
 "What?"
 But
 I
 would
 say
 to


any
 parent
 out
 there,
 give
 your
 kids


ownership
 of
 trips.
 I
 think
 it
 teaches


so
 many
 skills.
 Planning,
 researching
 on


the
 internet,
 understanding
 fake


reviews,
 real
 reviews,
 and
 getting
 their


input.
 And
 I
 think
 kids
 get
 a
 lot
 more


bought
 into
 a
 trip
 when
 they
 get
 to
 plan


some
 of
 the
 itinerary.
 So
 I
 highly


recommend
 that.
 Maybe
 not
 the
 whole
 trip


like
 I
 did,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 good
 for


for
 kids
 to
 do
 that.


Back
 to
 points,
 I
 think
 most
 people
 know


that
 points
 are
 something
 that
 they
 can


earn
 from
 using
 credit
 cards.
 Whether


it's
 a
 card
 from
 a
 bank,
 whether
 it's
 a


co-branded
 card
 between
 an
 airline
 and
 a


bank.
 How
 does
 it
 work?
 Why
 do
 credit


cards
 offer
 points?
 What's
 in
 it
 for


them?
 How
 is
 it
 not
 a
 scam?


So,
 here's
 the
 skinny
 on
 how
 credit
 card


companies
 make
 money.
 And
 trust
 me,


they're
 making
 a
 lot
 of
 it.
 So,
 never


feel
 bad
 about
 getting
 your
 portion


back.
 Why
 do
 credit
 cards
 offer
 points?


The
 big
 reason
 why
 is
 in
 the
 US


interchange.
 So
 every
 time
 you
 use
 a


credit
 card,
 grocery,
 restaurant,
 that


vendor
 is
 paying
 about
 2%
 in
 fees
 to
 the


credit
 card
 processor
 which
 then
 gets


most
 of
 it
 gets
 passed
 on
 to
 the
 bank.


The
 bank
 then
 kicks
 you
 back
 a
 portion


of
 that
 about
 1%
 or
 so
 in
 the
 form
 of


rewards.
 The
 banks
 know
 that
 people
 are


motivated
 by
 points
 and
 there's
 a
 huge


arms
 race
 that
 we
 are
 in
 the
 thick
 of


AMX
 versus
 Chase
 versus
 City
 versus


Capital
 One
 because
 there's
 so
 much


competition.
 They
 all
 have
 to
 compete
 to


give
 you
 more
 value
 back.
 Now,
 they
 may


lose
 money
 on
 the
 transaction,
 but
 they


want
 you
 as
 a
 customer
 and
 spending


every
 day
 because
 they're
 earning
 on
 all


of
 your
 purchases.
 Plus,
 they're
 getting


annual
 fees
 and
 plus
 inevitably,
 a
 lot


of
 people
 are
 going
 to
 carry
 a
 balance


at
 one
 point
 or
 another,
 right?


So,
 they're
 making
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 You


can
 get
 your
 value
 back.
 Avoid
 interest.


Avoid
 late
 fees.
 You
 can
 win
 by
 getting


your
 value
 of
 the
 points.
 And
 then
 most


importantly
 once
 you
 have
 those
 points


redeem
 them
 for
 absolute
 maximum
 value.


The
 other
 biggest
 factor
 is
 your
 credit


is
 an
 asset.
 And
 by
 getting
 credit
 cards


and
 let
 me
 be
 ultra
 clear
 here
 you
 have


to
 spend
 wisely
 and
 pay
 them
 off
 in


full.
 If
 you
 are
 going
 to
 get
 into


credit
 card
 debt
 if
 you're
 carrying


balances
 do
 not
 get
 travel
 rewards


credit
 cards.
 The
 APRs
 will
 eat
 you


alive.
 the
 val,
 you
 know,
 what
 you're


paying
 in
 interest
 will
 negate
 all
 the


value
 of
 those
 points
 and
 more.
 So,
 if


you're
 in
 a
 situation
 where
 you're
 in


debt,
 paying
 high
 APR,
 my


recommendations
 today
 are
 not
 geared


towards
 you.


And
 just,
 can
 you
 explain
 really
 quickly


what
 APR
 is?


Yeah,
 annual
 percentage
 rate
 is
 the


percent
 you're
 going
 to
 pay
 for


borrowing
 money
 from
 a
 bank.
 And
 on


credit
 cards,
 it's
 really
 high.
 It
 may


be
 over
 30%.


Now,
 when
 we're
 talking
 about
 points
 and


miles
 that
 you're
 getting,
 these
 are


worth
 1
 to
 two
 cents
 a
 piece.
 So
 really


there
 is
 no
 way
 where
 you
 pay
 interest


on
 balances
 and
 that
 the
 value
 of
 your


points
 are
 going
 to
 make
 sense.
 And
 if


you
 are
 carrying
 a
 balance,
 no
 shame,


but
 get
 a
 credit
 card
 that
 has
 0%
 APR


for
 18
 months.
 Neutralize
 that
 debt


before
 you
 can
 truly
 take
 full
 advantage


of
 the
 points
 ecosystem
 with
 credit


cards.


Are
 there
 other
 pitfalls
 that
 you
 warn


people
 about
 to
 keep
 their
 eyes
 open
 for


before
 they
 get
 in
 the
 game?
 I
 would
 say


start
 slowly.
 So,
 another
 thing
 to


consider
 is
 the
 signup
 bonus.
 This
 is


the
 initial
 dopamine
 hit
 that
 the
 credit


card
 companies
 want
 you
 to
 get.
 It


jumpst
 starts
 your
 balance.
 What
 they'll


say
 is
 if
 you're
 eligible,
 the
 bank's


going
 to
 give
 you
 a
 bunch
 of
 miles
 or


points
 as
 a
 welcome
 offer.
 And
 there's


usually
 a
 spend
 requirement
 attached.


So,
 $3,000
 within
 3
 months.
 But
 there's


some
 nuance
 that
 some
 people
 make


mistakes
 on,
 including
 the
 annual
 fee


for
 the
 card
 does
 not
 count
 towards


suspend,
 right?
 And
 also,
 the
 clock


starts
 ticking
 not
 when
 you
 activate
 the


card.
 This
 is
 a
 big
 one.
 It's
 when
 you


get
 approved.


So,
 if
 you
 get
 approved
 and
 you're
 on


vacation,
 you
 come
 back
 2
 weeks
 later.


So
 many
 people
 will
 think,
 "Oh,
 it's,


you
 know,
 when
 I
 start
 spending
 on
 it."


Wrong.
 So,
 I
 always
 recommend
 you


overspend
 beyond
 what
 you
 think
 you've


hit
 just
 to
 be
 safe.
 But
 understand


there
 are
 small
 nuances.
 There's
 always


a
 cost.
 I
 always
 recommend
 everyone
 who


gets
 into
 this
 start
 with
 one
 card,
 pay


it
 off,
 get
 in
 the
 groove.
 But
 these


signup
 bonuses
 are
 real
 money
 and
 this


is
 what
 gets
 people
 really
 hooked
 into


this
 game.


So
 you
 have
 to
 when
 thinking
 about
 a


sign
 on
 bonus,
 you
 have
 to
 think
 about


offsetting
 the
 cost,
 the
 annual
 fee
 of


the
 card,
 number
 one.
 And
 number
 two,


think
 about
 you
 might
 get
 instantly


approved
 for
 a
 card.
 Yep.


Try
 and
 start
 spending
 toward
 that


minimum
 spend
 as
 soon
 as
 possible
 and


not
 waiting
 until
 you


correct
 open
 the
 mail.


And
 many
 credit
 card
 companies
 will
 give


you
 a
 digital
 card
 so
 you
 can
 begin


using
 it
 right
 away.


[Music]


You
 I
 know
 in
 in
 your
 book
 talk
 about


points
 as
 an
 illquid
 asset.
 So
 that


means
 that
 points
 are
 part
 of
 your


personal
 finance
 package.
 When
 you
 look


at
 your
 personal
 finances,
 you
 should


consider
 it
 as
 currency.


Absolutely.
 And
 when
 you're
 thinking


about
 rewards,
 there
 are
 three
 flavors.


In
 my
 opinion,
 the
 main
 three
 points


currencies
 or
 rewards
 currencies
 are


number
 one,
 cash
 back.
 So
 that's
 pretty


simple.
 It's
 a
 percentage
 back
 of
 every


dollar
 you
 spend.
 In
 general,
 I
 would


say
 the
 average
 is
 about
 1
 and
 a.5%
 cash


back.
 That's
 a
 solid
 return.


And
 who
 is
 that
 good
 for?


I
 would
 say
 this
 is
 good
 for
 people
 who


have
 no
 interest
 in
 traveling,
 who
 might


have
 really
 tight
 budgets,
 are
 really


just
 focused
 on
 their
 finances,
 putting


money
 away
 into
 an
 emergency
 fund.
 Like


that's
 you
 should
 at least
 be
 getting


cash
 back.
 That
 is
 the
 baseline.


So
 the
 second
 type
 of
 currency
 is


co-brand
 rewards.
 And
 this
 is
 your


airline
 credit
 card,
 your
 hotel
 credit


card.
 Whenever
 you
 spend,
 you're
 getting


points
 directly
 deposited
 into
 a
 single


airline
 or
 hotel.
 The
 upside
 to
 this
 is


that
 you
 can
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 perks.
 Free


check
 bags,
 priority
 boarding,
 sweet


upgrades,
 etc.
 So,
 you're
 only
 earning


one
 specific
 airline
 currency,
 but


you're
 getting
 some
 other
 perks
 that


might
 have
 real
 value
 that
 might
 make


your
 travel
 smoother,
 that
 might
 save


you
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 You
 know,
 having
 a


hotel
 credit
 card
 that
 gets
 your
 family


breakfast,
 right?


And
 is
 this
 good
 for
 people
 who
 are


brand
 loyal?


You
 need
 to
 do
 the
 math.
 So,
 if
 you


check
 bags
 and
 fly
 Delta
 all
 the
 time,


you
 know
 that
 having
 one
 of
 their


co-brand
 cards
 gets
 you
 a
 free
 check
 bag


for
 you
 and
 I
 think
 eight
 companions.


So,
 the
 check
 bags
 these
 days
 can
 easily


be
 40
 bucks
 each.
 So,
 think
 about
 it.


One
 round
 trip,
 you're
 paying
 150
 bucks


for
 a
 card,
 but
 you're
 saving
 400
 a


trip,
 right?


So,
 that's
 where
 you
 have
 to
 do
 the
 math


because
 the
 third
 currency
 and
 the
 one


that
 I'm
 the
 most
 bullish
 on,


transferable
 points
 from
 credit
 card


companies.
 And
 this
 has
 been
 the
 biggest


trend.
 So
 instead
 of
 earning
 a
 single


airline
 mile
 or
 a
 cash
 back
 point,
 you


earn
 with
 the
 bank
 and
 then
 the
 bank


gives
 you
 a
 couple
 really
 great
 ways
 to


redeem
 those
 points.
 Number
 one,
 they


allow
 you
 to
 use
 it
 like
 cash
 to
 book


any
 flight
 or
 hotel,
 usually
 at
 about
 1


cent
 or
 1.5
 cents.
 But
 the
 real


special
 sauce
 in
 the
 transferable
 points


is
 transferring
 them
 to
 different


airlines
 and
 hotels.
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 the


cards
 often
 they
 run
 transfer
 bonuses.


So,
 this
 allows
 you
 instead
 of
 just


banking
 in
 one
 single
 airline
 program


like
 a
 co-brand
 card
 does,
 you
 can
 bank


into
 a
 mega
 program
 that
 allows
 you
 to


transfer
 to
 tons
 of
 different
 options.


Most
 points
 experts
 will
 say
 put
 most
 of


your
 spend
 on
 a
 transferable
 point
 card


or
 a
 couple
 of
 them
 because
 it
 opens
 up


a
 world
 of
 opportunities.


So,
 you
 can
 earn
 rewards
 from
 groceries,


dining
 out,
 you
 can
 even
 earn
 rewards
 by


paying
 your
 utilities.
 What
 is
 your


practical
 advice,
 Brian,
 in
 terms
 of


maximizing
 those
 rewards?


I
 want
 everyone
 to
 take
 out
 their


monthly
 budget,
 look
 at
 the
 major


categories,
 the
 dining,
 rent,


groceries,
 gas,
 you
 know,
 how
 much
 you


spending.
 What
 are
 your
 top
 categories


and
 and
 where
 are
 you
 spending
 the
 most


money?
 Yes,
 you
 may
 want
 to
 just
 go
 out


and
 just
 start
 applying
 like
 crazy,
 but


no,
 have
 a
 strategy.
 Do
 some
 research
 on


each
 bank's
 rules
 for
 which
 cards
 to


get.
 And
 then
 really
 the
 biggest
 thing


is
 look
 at
 what
 you
 spend
 money
 on
 and


finding
 the
 credit
 card
 that
 has
 the


highest
 multiplier
 in
 that
 category.


Okay,
 so
 what
 is
 the
 best
 credit
 card


for
 dining?
 So
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 out


there
 cuz
 dining
 is
 a
 popular
 category.


And
 you
 know
 then
 the
 other
 thing
 is
 the


annual
 fees
 on
 these
 cards.
 So
 a
 lot
 of


the
 cards
 that
 have
 higher
 annual
 fees


have
 higher
 category
 bonuses,
 but
 you


have
 to
 take
 into
 account,
 okay,
 I'm


spending
 more
 to
 get
 that.
 So


it's
 really
 a
 holistic
 vision
 of
 looking


at
 not
 just
 the
 earning
 of
 points.
 So


how
 much
 how
 many
 of
 these
 points
 do
 I


earn?
 How
 can
 I
 use
 them
 and
 then
 how


much
 is
 this
 costing
 me?


So
 what
 I'm
 hearing
 is
 in
 every
 aspect


of
 playing
 the
 points
 game.


The
 most
 important
 thing
 it
 seems
 to
 me


is
 understanding
 what
 your
 personal


finances
 are,
 what
 your
 goals
 are,
 not


just
 goals
 for
 travel,
 but
 your
 your


financial
 goals
 and
 how
 you
 actually


spend
 your
 money.
 So
 therefore,
 you
 can


figure
 out
 how
 to
 leverage
 different


cards
 based
 on
 what
 your
 actual
 reality


is.


Correct.


So
 when
 you
 have
 a
 a
 card
 like
 an
 MX
 or


a
 Chase
 where
 you
 have
 rewards,
 you
 have


a
 bank
 of
 them,
 are
 you
 sitting
 down
 and


assessing
 when
 you're
 planning
 for
 a


trip?
 Let
 me
 think
 about
 where
 I
 want
 to


go.
 Let
 me
 think
 about
 what
 airline
 I


want
 to
 fly
 and
 then
 transfer
 the
 points


from
 that
 bank
 to
 whatever
 airline
 or


hotel
 you're
 you're
 trying
 to
 use
 or


what
 what
 is


the
 joy
 the
 joy
 of
 the
 transferable


points
 programs
 is
 that
 you
 can
 bank


with
 confidence
 knowing
 well
 I
 don't


know
 if
 next
 summer
 I
 want
 to
 go
 to


Italy
 or
 I
 want
 to
 go
 on
 safari
 or
 what


if
 we


because
 no
 matter
 where
 you
 want
 to
 go


you
 generally
 have
 so
 many
 options


okay


that
 you
 can
 make
 it
 work


and
 one
 of
 my
 best
 tips
 these
 these
 days


is
 acrew
 valuable
 points,
 these


transferable
 points
 and
 let
 the
 deals


tell
 you
 where
 you
 go
 on
 vacation.
 You


know,
 you
 may
 have
 bucket
 list
 trips
 you


or
 you
 want
 to
 go
 to
 Italy.
 And
 I
 know
 a


lot
 of
 people
 want
 to
 do
 Florida
 over


the
 holidays,
 but


airline
 programs
 change
 so
 much.
 I


generally
 just
 don't
 want
 you
 to
 put
 all


your
 miles
 in
 one
 single
 airline
 because


they
 devalue
 year
 over
 year.
 Meaning


that
 what
 once
 was
 a
 90,000
 point
 free


night
 at
 your
 favorite
 resort
 overnight


jumped
 to
 130,000
 points
 a
 night.
 If
 you


put
 all
 your
 points,
 you
 know,
 in
 a


credit
 card
 company,
 even
 if
 one
 of


their
 transfer
 partners
 or
 a
 couple


change
 the
 rules,
 you
 then
 have
 other


options.

When
 is
 it
 worth
 buying
 points?


So,
 buying
 points
 is
 really
 interesting.


It's
 definitely
 an
 arbitrage
 game
 and


you
 need
 to
 know
 how
 to
 redeem
 them.
 So,


if
 you
 don't
 have
 an
 exact
 redemption
 in


mind
 or
 know
 how
 you're
 going
 to
 redeem


those
 points,
 don't
 buy
 them.
 Buying


points
 is
 only
 for
 people
 if
 you've
 done


the
 math
 and
 you
 know
 the
 redemption.


But


give
 an
 examp
 Yeah.


So,
 Hilton
 Hilton
 allows
 you
 to
 buy


points
 pretty
 cheap.
 And
 Hilton
 has
 this


new
 beautiful
 Waldorf
 Histori
 in
 Costa


Rica
 that
 just
 opened.
 It's
 about
 $2,000


a
 night.


Wow.


But
 it's
 about
 120,000
 points
 a
 night.


So,
 what
 that
 means
 is
 you
 can
 buy


120,000
 points
 at
 a
 half
 a
 cent
 a
 piece


for
 $600.
 So,
 you
 can
 spend
 2,000
 to


book
 direct
 or
 you
 can
 buy
 $600
 to
 get
 a


free
 night
 via
 points.


Okay?


And
 Hilton
 gives
 the
 fifth
 night
 free


when
 redeeming
 for
 points,
 not
 when


paying.
 So,
 this
 is
 where
 a
 lot
 of
 smart


people
 I
 know
 say,
 "Why
 would
 I
 ever
 pay


directly
 when
 I
 can
 buy
 points
 for
 a


third
 of
 the
 price
 and
 then
 get
 the


fifth
 knife
 free?"
 Bam.
 That's
 when
 you


just
 won.
 Air
 France.
 It's
 the
 same.


Flying
 Blue
 is
 an
 amazing
 program.


60,000
 points
 one
 way
 business
 class
 New


York
 to
 Paris.
 That's
 a
 $3,000
 ticket.


Air
 France
 will
 let
 you
 buy
 points
 at


around
 1.5
 cents
 a
 piece.
 So
 60,000


points
 is
 900
 bucks.
 So
 would
 you
 rather


pay
 3,000
 to
 the
 airline
 or
 would
 you


rather
 buy
 points
 and
 spend
 900?


Right?
 And
 of
 course
 Hilton
 and
 the


Flying
 Blue
 program,
 these
 are
 just


examples
 of
 the
 types
 of
 strategies
 you


can
 employ
 when
 you're
 looking
 to
 buy


points
 and
 then
 use
 those
 points
 to
 buy


reward
 flights
 or
 hotel
 nights.
 and


ultimately
 pay
 less.


Not
 only
 that,
 what
 I
 want
 people
 to


understand
 is
 the
 benefit
 to
 buying


points,
 especially
 when
 there's
 by
 miles


promotions,
 is
 most
 award
 tickets,
 most


hotel
 reservations
 are
 fully
 refundable


when
 you
 use
 your
 points.
 Award
 tickets


are
 when
 you
 transfer
 points
 to
 an


airlines
 frequent
 flyer
 program
 and
 you


book
 the
 flight
 as
 an
 award
 ticket


completely
 using
 miles.
 That
 is


refundable.
 This
 is
 something
 most


people
 don't
 realize.
 When
 you're


calculating,
 well,
 should
 I
 redeem
 miles


or
 should
 I
 pay
 for
 the
 ticket
 when
 you


redeem
 miles,
 it
 is
 a
 refundable
 ticket.


So,
 don't
 compare
 it
 to
 what
 basic


economy
 costs
 because
 when
 you
 redeem


your
 airline
 miles
 for
 an
 award
 ticket,


that's
 a
 full
 fair
 ticket.
 Meaning,
 up


until
 1
 minute
 before
 departure,
 you
 can


cancel,
 get
 all
 your
 miles
 back
 for


free.


That
 is
 incred.
 I
 had
 no
 idea.


Yes.
 And
 I
 take
 this
 a
 step
 further.


Having
 points
 is
 like
 an
 insurance


policy
 cuz
 guess
 what?
 when
 airlines


start
 delaying
 and
 canceling
 my
 flight,


I'm
 not
 waiting
 in
 the
 two-hour
 line.


I'm
 on
 my
 phone
 instantly
 booking
 backup


reservations
 on
 different
 airlines.
 So,


if
 my
 one
 airline
 can't
 get
 me
 out,
 I'm


walking
 to
 the
 other
 airline
 cuz
 I
 have


award
 ticket
 for
 2
 hours
 later.
 If
 my


original
 flight
 ends
 up
 going
 out,
 I


click
 one
 button
 and
 get
 all
 my
 miles


back
 for
 the
 other
 reservations.
 You


know,
 these
 points
 are
 very
 valuable.


That's
 a
 hack.


And
 one
 other
 tip,
 airlines
 charge
 a
 lot


for
 frequent
 flyer
 mile
 tickets.
 You
 may


want
 to
 just
 get
 something
 booked.
 Your


honeymoon,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 risk


waiting
 till
 last
 minute,
 but
 you
 pay
 a


premium,
 keep
 checking,
 and
 if
 the
 price


goes
 down,
 most
 programs
 will
 let
 you


cancel
 and
 rebook
 at
 the
 lower
 rate
 and


get
 your
 miles
 back.
 With
 the
 airlines


bullying
 us
 around,
 I
 want
 people
 to


have
 this
 information
 where
 they
 can,


you
 know,


fight
 back.


Fight
 back
 and
 and
 get
 their
 money
 off


the
 table.
